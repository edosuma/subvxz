01:39.498 --> 01:41.901
Recount!

01:41.933 --> 01:45.403
Write about something that's
happened to you in the past.

01:45.436 --> 01:49.341
<i>It's difficult to tell
who Miss Bamford is looking at,</i>

01:49.375 --> 01:52.378
<i>with that one eye that dips
and bobs like a maniac.</i>

01:52.411 --> 01:54.347
If it's already happened,
Miss Bamford,

01:54.379 --> 01:56.348
it must be in the past.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.384
Tell us about yourselves.

01:58.417 --> 02:02.388
Something for every letter
of the alphabet.

02:02.421 --> 02:07.627
For example, A is for 'Albany'.

02:07.659 --> 02:09.762
I was born in Albany.

02:09.794 --> 02:13.298
My birth was a cause
for great celebration.

02:13.331 --> 02:15.400
People danced in the streets

02:15.433 --> 02:20.272
and there were firework displays
for two nights in a row.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.443
<i>Our school is in Albany,
so I suppose Miss Bamford</i>

02:24.475 --> 02:26.512
<i>is trying to make
the example relevant.</i>

02:26.544 --> 02:28.881
<i>But it is a false statement.</i>

02:28.913 --> 02:33.251
<i>I mean, no-one's birth causes
that amount of excitement.</i>

02:33.284 --> 02:36.188
Candice, it's a recount.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.758
Sometimes the truth
is too plain.

02:38.790 --> 02:42.527
And your job in this assignment
is to entertain.

02:42.561 --> 02:45.365
Uh-uh!

02:47.366 --> 02:48.968
You'll use the written component

02:49.001 --> 02:52.271
to craft a brief
oral presentation

02:52.304 --> 02:53.973
for your parents on Open Day

02:54.006 --> 02:58.745
based on a letter of the
alphabet you'll be assigned.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.881
Any questions?

03:04.515 --> 03:05.817
I wonder, Miss Bamford,

03:05.850 --> 03:07.485
if you're talking about
a narrative,

03:07.519 --> 03:10.522
because I thought a recount
had to be factual.

03:10.556 --> 03:12.825
Alternatively,
a narrative recount

03:12.858 --> 03:15.495
might be a more suitable
descriptor.

03:20.498 --> 03:22.501
Hm.

03:37.716 --> 03:39.252
- Hi, Pam!
- Hi, Candice.

03:42.854 --> 03:45.657
- Hello, funny little girl.
- Hi, Rajah!

04:10.949 --> 04:12.785
Hi, Mr Weigard!

04:12.818 --> 04:15.521
Bugger off! Get off my lawn!

04:42.781 --> 04:44.750
<i>A is for 'assignment'.</i>

04:44.783 --> 04:47.586
<i>And I intend to do
a thorough job.</i>

04:47.619 --> 04:51.023
<i>My story is a complicated one</i>

04:51.055 --> 04:53.925
<i>and I don't know
all the fine details.</i>

04:53.959 --> 04:57.762
<i>Everyone has tried very hard
to keep me in ignorance -</i>

04:57.795 --> 05:00.766
<i>Mum, Dad and Rich Uncle Brian.</i>

05:00.798 --> 05:03.868
<i>But I would have to be living
in a lead-lined coffin</i>

05:03.901 --> 05:07.639
<i>not to realise
everyone is miserable.</i>

05:07.673 --> 05:09.709
<i>Maybe I can do
something about it.</i>

05:13.644 --> 05:15.314
Come in.

05:17.815 --> 05:21.387
<i>My sister, Sky,
died three years ago.</i>

05:22.887 --> 05:24.856
<i>Mum hasn't been the same since.</i>

05:27.625 --> 05:30.596
Mum, I need to know
about my birth.

05:30.629 --> 05:32.131
Your birth?

05:32.163 --> 05:33.765
Birth begins with B.

05:33.798 --> 05:36.501
It's the second chapter
of my assignment.

05:38.069 --> 05:39.771
Come.

05:41.005 --> 05:42.807
What do you want to know?

05:42.841 --> 05:44.576
Everything.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.879
Well, you were
a tricky delivery.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.752
You came into this world...

05:54.952 --> 05:57.155
..accompanied by...

05:57.189 --> 05:58.858
..pain...

05:59.824 --> 06:02.661
..blood and tears.

06:02.694 --> 06:04.163
What was Dad doing?

06:04.196 --> 06:09.769
I wasn't at your birth,
alright? I was too late.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.170
Story of my life.

06:11.202 --> 06:13.738
So Rich Uncle Brian
stepped into the breach?

06:15.774 --> 06:19.644
Your Uncle Brian, your uncle,

06:19.677 --> 06:22.615
isn't the most reliable
witness in the world.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.950
You sailed into this world

06:24.983 --> 06:26.985
on a sea of love

06:27.019 --> 06:28.721
and you cruised
through calm waters

06:28.754 --> 06:31.724
and berthed with scarcely
a ripple into our hearts.

06:31.757 --> 06:37.763
And there, my sweet mariner,
you remain,

06:37.795 --> 06:40.699
docked in love.

06:42.468 --> 06:43.903
<i>A few years ago,</i>

06:43.935 --> 06:46.704
<i>Dad and Uncle Brian
were in business together.</i>

06:46.737 --> 06:49.841
<i>But they had a big falling out.</i>

06:49.875 --> 06:52.211
<i>C is for 'court case',</i>

06:52.244 --> 06:56.015
<i>where nasty, unforgivable
things were said.</i>

06:56.048 --> 06:58.016
<i>Dad and Uncle Brian's business</i>

06:58.050 --> 07:00.819
<i>was sold to pay
for the legal costs.</i>

07:00.853 --> 07:03.656
<i>And when it was
all done and dusted,</i>

07:03.689 --> 07:05.825
<i>Dad was broken...</i>

07:05.858 --> 07:07.593
<i>..and broke.</i>

07:07.625 --> 07:09.627
<i>And Uncle Brian</i>

07:09.661 --> 07:10.862
<i>was rich,</i>

07:10.896 --> 07:13.466
<i>rich,</i>

07:13.499 --> 07:17.203
<i>RICH Uncle Brian.</i>

07:49.100 --> 07:52.605
Everyone,
this is Douglas Benson.

07:52.637 --> 07:56.941
He's new to the area
and he doesn't know anyone.

07:56.975 --> 07:59.545
So I would ask
that you all treat him

07:59.577 --> 08:02.280
with kindness
and consideration.

08:02.314 --> 08:05.751
Douglas, you take that seat
next to Candice Phee.

08:07.319 --> 08:09.188
Fruitcups.

08:09.221 --> 08:11.122
Quick sticks!

08:12.557 --> 08:13.959
Right.

08:15.093 --> 08:16.829
Back to work.

08:36.581 --> 08:38.250
Can you keep a secret?

08:39.585 --> 08:40.986
No.

08:42.354 --> 08:44.023
Oh.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.296
Not even a little bit?

08:51.330 --> 08:53.232
No.

08:54.365 --> 08:56.034
Oh.

09:00.639 --> 09:02.707
Do you want to hear
my secret anyways?

09:02.740 --> 09:04.276
No.

09:05.376 --> 09:06.811
Oh.

09:24.296 --> 09:25.831
What are you doing now?

09:25.864 --> 09:28.200
Working on a way of
getting out of here.

09:28.232 --> 09:29.867
Well, that's mysterious.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.703
- Is it?
- Yeah.

09:31.736 --> 09:33.639
Because it doesn't take
much working out.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.774
You just go out the front door
and there's a big gate.

09:35.807 --> 09:37.643
I didn't mean that.

09:37.676 --> 09:39.612
It's to do with my secret.

09:45.317 --> 09:47.952
Jen Marshall,
would you mind moving

09:47.985 --> 09:49.754
so I can access my locker?

09:49.788 --> 09:51.356
"Jen Marshall,
would you mind moving

09:51.389 --> 09:52.857
"so I can access my locker?"

09:52.890 --> 09:54.961
Really, Essen?

09:57.828 --> 09:58.964
Ha.

10:02.801 --> 10:05.004
Why did she call you 'Essen'?

10:05.037 --> 10:08.841
It's a phonetic representation
of S-N,

10:08.874 --> 10:11.176
which is short for
'special needs'.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.745
Many people think
I have learning disabilities,

10:13.778 --> 10:14.947
but they're mistaken.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.649
I wrote a note to Jen

10:16.682 --> 10:19.951
saying that everyone is special
and everyone has needs.

10:19.985 --> 10:23.755
So her insult - because that's
what she intends it to be -

10:23.788 --> 10:25.758
is wide off the mark.

10:32.831 --> 10:34.832
About my secret.

10:34.865 --> 10:36.235
I can't keep secrets.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.269
I'm from another dimension.

10:38.302 --> 10:40.239
Well, that's nice.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.308
Not really.

10:43.341 --> 10:46.745
I like the dimension
I come from. This one sucks.

10:48.746 --> 10:51.082
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.922
You know about
M-theory, I imagine?

10:56.955 --> 10:58.357
No.

10:58.389 --> 11:00.225
It's a multidimensional
extension of string theory,

11:00.258 --> 11:03.696
in which all universes -
the multiverse, if you like -

11:03.729 --> 11:06.331
are created by collisions
between p-branes.

11:06.364 --> 11:08.200
There's an infinite
number of Earths

11:08.232 --> 11:10.201
and each will be
slightly different.

11:10.235 --> 11:12.471
The other universes are
separate from this one,

11:12.504 --> 11:15.807
not by space or time,
but a different dimension.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.341
I came through that dimension.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.711
How?

11:18.744 --> 11:20.112
It involves
manipulating dimensions

11:20.144 --> 11:21.980
and invoking gravity,
of course.

11:22.013 --> 11:23.115
How?

11:23.148 --> 11:24.850
I jumped out of a tree.

11:24.883 --> 11:26.218
High-tech.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.319
Can you come over to my place
after school

11:28.352 --> 11:29.988
one afternoon this week?

11:32.490 --> 11:35.226
I've never been invited
to someone's house before.

11:35.259 --> 11:38.163
Will it be OK
with your mum and dad?

11:38.196 --> 11:39.831
I don't have a dad.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.066
And she's not my mum.

11:41.099 --> 11:43.402
She's just a facsimile
of my real mother,

11:43.434 --> 11:45.436
who's in another dimension.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.206
Oh, yes.

11:49.140 --> 11:51.242
Well, does she know
she's a facsimile?

11:51.275 --> 11:52.745
She thinks I'm mad.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.779
She took me to the hospital

11:54.812 --> 11:56.414
and some idiot
with a white coat,

11:56.447 --> 11:59.050
hearing that
I'd fallen from a tree,

11:59.083 --> 12:01.352
pronounced that I was
suffering from loss of memory

12:01.385 --> 12:03.788
caused by a blow to the head.

12:03.822 --> 12:07.225
It's unscientific
and, frankly, insufferable.

12:15.299 --> 12:18.503
Anyway, she'll love the idea
of you coming over.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.038
She'll think it's a sign
of my mental health improving.

12:21.072 --> 12:23.908
You know, having friends.

12:28.813 --> 12:31.349
<i>F is for 'Frances'.</i>

12:31.383 --> 12:34.052
<i>'Frances' was a label.</i>

12:34.085 --> 12:36.989
<i>Sky was who she was to me.</i>

12:38.123 --> 12:40.459
<i>Who she would always be.</i>

12:42.259 --> 12:44.496
<i>No-one talks about that night.</i>

13:09.053 --> 13:11.355
<i>All I could hear was screaming.</i>

13:11.389 --> 13:13.259
<i>I suppose it was mine.</i>

13:14.259 --> 13:16.061
<i>I know what people think -</i>

13:16.094 --> 13:19.165
<i>that I blame myself
for what happened to Sky.</i>

13:20.331 --> 13:22.201
<i>But I don't.</i>

13:22.234 --> 13:24.469
<i>Sky died of cot death.</i>

13:24.501 --> 13:28.439
<i>'Sudden infant death syndrome'
is the medical term.</i>

13:28.472 --> 13:29.942
<i>Though, that explains nothing,</i>

13:29.975 --> 13:32.610
<i>because no-one knows
why it happens.</i>

13:32.644 --> 13:34.346
<i>It just does.</i>

13:34.379 --> 13:36.447
<i>No-one's to blame.</i>

13:43.087 --> 13:46.558
Focus! Think of
yourselves as a mirror.

13:52.197 --> 13:54.899
What? Is something wrong?

13:54.932 --> 13:56.400
You're not happy

13:56.433 --> 13:58.569
because you can't get back
into your own world.

13:58.602 --> 14:01.205
And despite all the evidence
against you,

14:01.239 --> 14:03.375
you're still trying
to get back?

14:03.408 --> 14:06.211
I will get back. I just need
to get the math right.

14:06.244 --> 14:10.415
It's hard, but eventually
I'll find the answer.

14:10.447 --> 14:12.350
Right.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.052
Because if you can
figure out a way

14:14.085 --> 14:15.586
to return to another dimension,

14:15.620 --> 14:18.523
surely I can figure out how
to put my family back together,

14:18.556 --> 14:21.192
to make everyone happy again.

14:21.225 --> 14:24.096
Do you have any experience
in the area?

14:25.029 --> 14:26.398
No.

14:26.431 --> 14:29.335
Well, start with something
small. For practice.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.603
"Think of
yourselves as a mirror."

14:46.551 --> 14:49.288
<i>Gavin is full of inspiration.</i>

14:49.321 --> 14:50.522
- Thanks, Mum.
- You look so great!

14:50.554 --> 14:52.657
<i>He'll know exactly what to do.</i>

14:57.562 --> 14:59.230
Here.

15:05.003 --> 15:07.439
Good luck with that!

15:07.471 --> 15:09.140
Bye-bye!

15:18.582 --> 15:20.552
You know your weird eye,
Miss Bamford?

15:20.585 --> 15:25.023
How it spins out of control
like a punctured balloon?

15:25.056 --> 15:28.326
Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension,

15:28.360 --> 15:31.462
he says it's so hyperactive
it should be on Ritalin.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.231
But that's not the issue.

15:34.264 --> 15:36.367
I suspect, Miss Bamford,

15:36.400 --> 15:38.736
that you are aware
of the cruel remarks

15:38.769 --> 15:41.105
made about your
peripatetic eyeball...

15:43.475 --> 15:47.111
Candice, do you mind
if I ask you a question?

15:47.144 --> 15:49.081
Not at all, Miss Bamford.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.649
Ask two
if the urge is irresistible.

15:51.682 --> 15:54.218
I'm curious.

15:54.251 --> 15:57.655
Your vocabulary is remarkable
for a 12-year-old.

15:57.688 --> 16:00.992
'Peripatetic', for example.

16:01.025 --> 16:02.526
Can you explain?

16:02.559 --> 16:04.261
Yes, certainly.

16:04.294 --> 16:07.466
'Peripatetic' means something
that wanders or travels...

16:07.499 --> 16:10.668
No, no, no!
I know what it means!

16:10.701 --> 16:13.437
I want to know how
<i>you</i> know what it means.

16:13.471 --> 16:16.774
Oh. I read the dictionary,
Miss Bamford.

16:16.807 --> 16:18.342
Most nights.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.312
It's my favourite book.

16:20.345 --> 16:25.250
Right now, I'm up to the letter
S, which is stupendous.

16:25.283 --> 16:27.185
It sets a very high standard,

16:27.217 --> 16:30.354
which, frankly,
T will not be able to match.

16:30.388 --> 16:32.658
But one should not prejudge.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.528
You were saying about my eye.

16:36.561 --> 16:38.129
Ah, yes.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.331
It seems to me, Miss Bamford,

16:40.365 --> 16:44.269
that there is a simple solution
to your ocular problem.

16:44.302 --> 16:46.671
What is more,
I have the solution right here,

16:46.703 --> 16:49.407
and I think
you should consider it.

17:02.519 --> 17:05.289
I bought them
as a pirate's job lot.

17:05.323 --> 17:07.059
I'm not suggesting

17:07.092 --> 17:09.761
you should attach, hook or pin
the parrot to your shoulder -

17:09.794 --> 17:12.297
though, that would be
a personal choice

17:12.329 --> 17:14.397
and I wouldn't
stand in your way.

17:14.432 --> 17:17.669
It's the eye patch I wanted
to bring to your attention.

17:17.701 --> 17:19.637
If you put this on,

17:19.671 --> 17:22.273
no-one will be able to see
your wandering eye.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.375
This would, at stroke,

17:24.409 --> 17:27.579
reduce the amount of teasing
you currently have to endure.

17:27.612 --> 17:29.815
It will lend you
a certain air -

17:29.847 --> 17:33.818
sinister, perhaps,
or even romantic.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.822
It will establish
an aura of mystery.

18:33.211 --> 18:34.779
Thank you, Candice.

18:47.491 --> 18:49.326
Do you like fruit, Candice?

18:49.359 --> 18:50.628
Yes, thank you.

18:50.662 --> 18:52.797
- Rockmelon?
- Yes, thank you.

18:52.829 --> 18:54.365
Strawberries?

18:54.398 --> 18:56.500
Yes, thank you.

18:56.534 --> 18:59.571
All on the... same plate?

19:00.538 --> 19:01.940
It's just that Douglas told me

19:01.972 --> 19:04.509
that you like to have things
in a certain way.

19:04.541 --> 19:08.279
So I wondered if you were OK
about having

19:08.313 --> 19:10.882
different colours of fruit
on the same plate,

19:10.914 --> 19:16.555
the way that you like to have
everything lined up just... so.

19:19.223 --> 19:22.593
You are autistic, aren't you?

19:22.626 --> 19:24.629
No.

19:46.584 --> 19:48.887
Oh! Sorry.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.856
Mmm!

19:57.761 --> 19:59.597
What did Miss Bamford say?

19:59.631 --> 20:00.832
She laughed.

20:00.865 --> 20:02.834
Oh. That's not good.

20:02.866 --> 20:05.369
No! It was great.

20:05.403 --> 20:06.938
It has given me great hope,

20:06.971 --> 20:10.275
Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension.

20:14.345 --> 20:16.714
Hmm.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.686
It's a horse.

21:29.953 --> 21:32.557
You should know
I'm scared of horses.

21:32.589 --> 21:34.492
Not this one.

21:50.674 --> 21:52.911
Wow!

21:52.943 --> 21:54.078
Told you.

21:54.112 --> 21:55.681
Watch this.

22:10.394 --> 22:12.696
- Can I pat him?
- No!

22:12.730 --> 22:15.834
And never feed it apples.

22:15.866 --> 22:19.104
Come on. We've got
more important things to do.

22:44.662 --> 22:47.399
G is for gravity, 'Candice'.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.668
May I use your pad and pen?

23:04.214 --> 23:05.884
What is it?

23:07.652 --> 23:08.987
It's a tesseract.

23:09.019 --> 23:10.187
Oh.

23:10.221 --> 23:12.656
To travel between
alternative worlds.

23:12.690 --> 23:16.693
I need to take the tesseract
to a fifth, sixth,

23:16.727 --> 23:21.032
seventh, eighth
and then a ninth dimension,

23:21.065 --> 23:23.500
wrap myself within
that construct,

23:23.534 --> 23:26.037
and then use gravity
to effect the journey.

23:26.069 --> 23:28.005
That's where the tree
comes into it?

23:28.038 --> 23:31.009
Correct. That's how I got here.

23:31.041 --> 23:33.444
But timing is everything.

23:33.478 --> 23:35.712
It has to be
at 6:30 in the evening.

23:35.746 --> 23:37.515
6:30 in the evening?

23:37.548 --> 23:40.852
I've been over and over
the equation.

23:40.884 --> 23:43.054
Problem is, gravity has

23:43.086 --> 23:45.423
a slightly different quality
in this world.

23:46.223 --> 23:47.692
So?

23:47.724 --> 23:49.193
So...

23:50.494 --> 23:53.630
..maybe I have to jump
somewhere higher

23:53.663 --> 23:55.533
than the tree in town.

24:14.085 --> 24:15.886
Dad, can I have a bike?

24:15.920 --> 24:17.755
You don't like riding, Candice.

24:17.788 --> 24:20.125
I'm newly motivated to like it.

24:21.025 --> 24:22.560
Maybe for your birthday.

24:22.593 --> 24:25.163
I need it tomorrow.

24:25.195 --> 24:28.265
It's essential that I be able
to ride to Douglas Benson's

24:28.298 --> 24:30.836
at 6:30 in the evening.

24:35.772 --> 24:37.842
Dad!

24:45.016 --> 24:47.585
Oh. It's perfect!

24:47.617 --> 24:50.587
Ta-da!

24:50.621 --> 24:51.956
Thank you!

24:51.989 --> 24:53.857
What do you want a bike for,
sweetie?

24:53.891 --> 24:55.560
I'm not at liberty to say,

24:55.593 --> 24:57.562
except that
it's for a good cause.

24:57.595 --> 25:00.932
Hmm. Well, I'm happy
to give you the bike, pumpkin.

25:00.964 --> 25:02.833
You don't have to come sailing
with me to pay for it.

25:02.866 --> 25:04.668
I know.

25:04.701 --> 25:06.703
But I do need to talk with you.

25:06.737 --> 25:08.540
In private.

25:08.573 --> 25:11.743
I've got a plan to execute,
and I'm beginning with you.

25:11.776 --> 25:13.711
Mm.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.615
<i>I couldn't blame
Rich Uncle Brian</i>

25:17.647 --> 25:20.551
<i>for being surprised that
I wanted to go on his yacht,</i>

25:20.585 --> 25:22.787
<i>because I cannot swim.</i>

25:22.819 --> 25:26.790
<i>I don't have sea legs,
I don't have sea arms.</i>

25:26.824 --> 25:31.062
<i>In fact, no part of my anatomy
is sea anything.</i>

25:31.095 --> 25:33.131
Oh!

25:33.163 --> 25:34.766
Oh.

25:34.798 --> 25:37.001
You're OK.

25:39.135 --> 25:41.772
There you go.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.009
- Rich Uncle Brian?
- Yes, pumpkin?

25:46.042 --> 25:48.145
There's a schism
between you and my dad.

25:48.179 --> 25:49.814
Mm.

25:49.846 --> 25:51.816
And, well, there must be
some way to mend the breach.

25:51.848 --> 25:53.617
Do we really want
to go there, pumpkin?

25:53.651 --> 25:55.820
- Yes.
- Hmm.

25:55.853 --> 25:57.689
Wouldn't the simplest
solution be

25:57.721 --> 25:59.656
if you gave him
a whopping pile of cash,

25:59.690 --> 26:01.927
and then everyone
would be happy?

26:06.196 --> 26:09.000
I've... tried, pumpkin.
I've tried.

26:09.032 --> 26:12.336
But it's just... not that
simple, unfortunately.

26:12.369 --> 26:14.137
Simple...

26:14.171 --> 26:17.008
I offered your dad half
of my income from that patent.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.942
He turned me down.

26:18.976 --> 26:20.378
'Cause what your father wanted

26:20.411 --> 26:22.212
was the legal acknowledgement
that he co-wrote it,

26:22.246 --> 26:24.082
as well as half the royalties.

26:24.115 --> 26:28.786
I couldn't accept that, 'cause
he didn't write it. I did.

26:28.818 --> 26:33.057
Now, the money -
he's welcome to it.

26:33.089 --> 26:35.759
But I can't lie about
the authorship. I can't.

26:36.993 --> 26:39.797
I simply can't.

26:39.829 --> 26:42.634
So you don't talk to each other
because of a signature,

26:42.666 --> 26:45.869
or lack thereof,
on a piece of paper?

26:45.903 --> 26:48.640
It sounds silly
when you put it like that.

26:48.673 --> 26:50.141
But yes.

26:53.243 --> 26:54.745
Oh!

27:21.872 --> 27:25.009
- Rich Uncle Brian...
- Yes, pumpkin?

27:25.041 --> 27:27.111
..do you still love
your brother?

27:28.746 --> 27:30.748
Yes, I do.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.817
Pumpkin, I surely do.

27:34.050 --> 27:36.855
And would you do anything
to mend that breach?

27:38.088 --> 27:39.790
Yes, of course.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.837
Careful, sweetheart.

27:53.871 --> 27:55.440
OK? Oh!

27:58.909 --> 28:00.912
Alright.

28:00.944 --> 28:03.147
Thank you, Rich Uncle Brian.

28:09.385 --> 28:11.021
That's alright.

28:12.222 --> 28:13.924
Hmm.

29:15.352 --> 29:16.855
Hmm.

30:47.944 --> 30:50.013
Hi! I'm Candice Phee.

30:50.914 --> 30:52.383
Nice to meet you.

30:52.415 --> 30:56.052
Do you know if Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension

30:56.086 --> 30:57.954
has come along yet?

30:57.988 --> 31:02.460
I'm just keeping a look out
in case he decides to...

31:02.492 --> 31:05.162
..do something foolish.

31:51.208 --> 31:53.177
<i>Flossy Jenkins
to the deli, please.</i>

31:53.210 --> 31:55.013
<i>Flossy Jenkins to the deli.</i>

31:56.246 --> 31:59.283
<i>Dad says
depression is complicated.</i>

31:59.316 --> 32:01.352
<i>There is no simple cure.</i>

32:01.384 --> 32:04.387
<i>But Mum was not
always depressed.</i>

32:04.421 --> 32:07.091
<i>Before Sky died,
she was active,</i>

32:07.124 --> 32:09.460
<i>optimistic and full of plans.</i>

32:09.492 --> 32:13.129
♪ If you had that chance again

32:13.163 --> 32:17.434

32:22.705 --> 32:24.507
You know what?

One day, pumpkin, we'll all go
to the United States

32:27.711 --> 32:29.447
and spend time in Nashville.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.614
It's on my bucket list.

<i>Nashville was never
mentioned after that.</i>

33:08.618 --> 33:13.290
<i>Like everything else,
it shrivelled and died.</i>

33:14.391 --> 33:16.461

Douglas!

35:04.867 --> 35:07.637
Hmm.

35:07.670 --> 35:11.341
Still no sign of Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension.

35:17.748 --> 35:20.184
You're unpredictable too.

35:20.217 --> 35:22.720
But... I get it.

35:22.753 --> 35:25.590
You just like doing things
your own way.

35:40.336 --> 35:41.806
Hmm.

35:52.481 --> 35:53.817
Ooh!

36:15.304 --> 36:16.706
I've made dinner!

36:16.739 --> 36:18.241
You what?

36:18.275 --> 36:19.577
I've made dinner.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.211
Why?

36:22.579 --> 36:23.914
So we can eat it.

36:23.947 --> 36:26.717
But I've already eaten.
I... had a sandwich.

36:26.750 --> 36:30.387
I've cooked a special meal
for Mum. To cheer her up.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.255
I bought all the ingredients

36:32.289 --> 36:35.292
and spent four hours
cooking her favourite dish.

36:35.324 --> 36:37.260
I thought it would be nice

36:37.293 --> 36:40.297
if for once
we ate together as a family.

36:40.329 --> 36:42.298
- Uh, Mum's in bed.
- I know.

36:42.331 --> 36:44.601
It would be helpful
if when I wake her

36:44.635 --> 36:47.571
I can say we are both waiting
around the dinner table.

36:47.603 --> 36:49.806
Uh...

36:51.708 --> 36:54.677
And if you could just put
this kerchief around your neck.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.246
I'm sorry?

36:56.280 --> 36:57.481
No need to apologise.

36:57.514 --> 37:00.517
I got your hat
out of the cupboard.

37:00.550 --> 37:03.954
I was hoping you might have
some cowboy boots...

37:03.987 --> 37:05.923
..and maybe some spurs.

37:05.956 --> 37:08.759
- Spurs?
- What about a lasso?

37:16.699 --> 37:18.335
Uncover your eyes.

37:20.603 --> 37:23.773
What is going on?

37:23.806 --> 37:25.975
A Southern-themed cook-up!

37:26.009 --> 37:27.577
Oh.

37:31.815 --> 37:32.715
OK.

37:32.748 --> 37:35.485
- Mm-hm.
- Oh!

37:35.518 --> 37:37.654
Mm-hm.

37:38.855 --> 37:40.557
Hmm.

37:43.327 --> 37:45.829
- Prawns.
- They call them shrimp.

37:45.862 --> 37:47.564
The recipe said to devein them,

37:47.597 --> 37:50.034
but I'm not skilled,
so I didn't.

37:51.101 --> 37:52.736
- Ah, beautiful.
- Delicious.

37:54.036 --> 37:56.472
So, what made you choose
this dish?

37:56.505 --> 38:00.411
Nashville. I remembered you
said you wanted to go there.

38:00.443 --> 38:05.014
The music, the dancing,
the hot shrimp po'boy.

38:05.047 --> 38:07.050
Do you remember?

38:07.083 --> 38:08.918
Yeah.

38:09.952 --> 38:12.422
Yeah, all the dreams
I had before.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.759
They don't have to
remain dreams.

38:15.726 --> 38:18.362
You are kind, pumpkin.

38:18.394 --> 38:20.931
And I'm very proud of you.

38:20.963 --> 38:24.067
Thank you.

38:31.875 --> 38:32.876
Eat!

38:32.909 --> 38:34.845
- Oh, yes.
- Oh.

38:51.695 --> 38:53.564
No.

39:07.177 --> 39:08.545
I can't.

39:31.835 --> 39:34.105
<i>I will be 13 on Sunday.</i>

39:36.005 --> 39:38.141
<i>I'm looking forward to that.</i>

39:39.976 --> 39:42.445
<i>13 carries the implication</i>

39:42.478 --> 39:45.415
<i>that you have completed
your apprenticeship as a child</i>

39:45.449 --> 39:48.085
<i>and can do
teenagery-type things</i>

39:48.117 --> 39:50.453
<i>without appearing a fraud.</i>

39:56.960 --> 39:59.061
<i>I used to dread my birthday.</i>

40:00.230 --> 40:02.865
<i>Mum and Dad would go
to considerable effort</i>

40:02.898 --> 40:04.167
<i>to make it a happy occasion.</i>

40:04.201 --> 40:06.969
- Gel pens!
- Gel pens.

40:07.003 --> 40:08.472
Yay!

40:11.974 --> 40:15.545
<i>But there were two
dark and brooding clouds</i>

40:15.579 --> 40:17.014
<i>looming over us.</i>

40:17.047 --> 40:19.849
Oh! Happy birthday, pumpkin!

40:19.882 --> 40:21.984
<i>One was Rich Uncle Brian -</i>

40:22.018 --> 40:25.556
<i>even though he doesn't look
much like a cloud.</i>

40:33.762 --> 40:36.165
<i>The other cloud is Sky.</i>

40:36.199 --> 40:39.702
<i>She died three days
before my birthday.</i>

40:39.735 --> 40:42.839
<i>She would have been
nearly four years old.</i>

40:42.873 --> 40:45.541
It's your birthday soon,
pumpkin.

40:45.574 --> 40:47.043
What would you like?

40:47.077 --> 40:48.846
Can I have anything?

40:48.878 --> 40:50.179
Well, within reason.

40:50.213 --> 40:53.182
You know we don't have
much money.

40:53.215 --> 40:55.251
This won't cost anything.

40:55.284 --> 40:58.254
I would like Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension

40:58.288 --> 41:00.824
to come with us to the cemetery.

41:02.826 --> 41:03.994
No.

41:04.027 --> 41:05.496
Why not?

41:05.528 --> 41:07.264
Because you know why, Candice.

41:07.297 --> 41:12.568
It's family only.
We do not invite friends.

41:12.601 --> 41:14.270
We do not have a party,
we do not celebrate.

41:14.304 --> 41:15.739
We pay our respects.

41:15.771 --> 41:17.907
Why don't we ask
Rich Uncle Brian, then?

41:17.940 --> 41:20.243
Because you know the answer
to that as well, Candice.

41:20.277 --> 41:21.845
Don't be deliberately stupid.

41:21.878 --> 41:24.681
- Sky should be celebrated.
- Her name was Frances.

41:24.713 --> 41:26.750
It should be a cause of joy
that she lived!

41:26.782 --> 41:28.018
Candice, stop...

41:28.050 --> 41:30.186
Not an excuse for misery
because she's dead!

41:30.219 --> 41:33.890
- I'm tired of feeling sad, Mum!
- That's enough.

41:33.923 --> 41:35.826
I love her too, but she's gone!

41:35.858 --> 41:37.561
Please stop.

41:37.594 --> 41:39.996
- It's time you accepted that!
- Candice!

41:40.030 --> 41:42.766
Sky is dead, Mum,
but we aren't!

41:42.798 --> 41:44.735
Shut up!

41:47.903 --> 41:50.240
Candice...

41:59.081 --> 42:01.018
I'm going to school.

42:02.251 --> 42:04.822
Candice!

42:06.655 --> 42:08.726
Pumpkin!

42:42.025 --> 42:44.795
<i>Waiting for progress
in the chest department</i>

42:44.827 --> 42:46.829
<i>is like watching grass grow.</i>

43:01.244 --> 43:02.880
Ready!

43:13.757 --> 43:15.592
We should go.

43:51.226 --> 43:54.063
<i>M is for 'mourning'.</i>

43:54.097 --> 43:57.234
<i>I wondered what lay
beneath the mound of grass.</i>

43:57.266 --> 44:01.137
<i>Was there anything left
of Sky by now?</i>

44:02.237 --> 44:04.040
<i>Bones, probably.</i>

44:07.143 --> 44:09.146
<i>That's all that would be left.</i>

44:11.715 --> 44:14.385
<i>It's difficult to pay respect
to bones.</i>

44:15.985 --> 44:17.788
<i>Because Sky could be somewhere.</i>

44:17.820 --> 44:20.423
<i>I hope she was somewhere.</i>

44:20.456 --> 44:25.228
<i>But I knew that
that somewhere wasn't here.</i>

44:40.744 --> 44:42.713
I've told you once,
I've told you twice...

44:42.746 --> 44:44.314
I won't do it again, sir.

44:56.358 --> 44:59.195
Would you like to come
to my birthday party on Sunday?

44:59.228 --> 45:00.896
No running up there!

45:00.929 --> 45:03.766
Yes. Of course I would.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.235
Will it be a big party?

45:05.268 --> 45:10.173
You, me, Mum and Dad. So, 25%
bigger than previous years.

45:10.206 --> 45:11.474
I think you'll find

45:11.507 --> 45:14.276
that's 33 1/3% bigger
than previous years.

45:14.309 --> 45:16.447
I'll take your word for it.

45:17.813 --> 45:20.016
It's gonna be full of drama,
though.

45:20.048 --> 45:22.052
Why?

45:22.085 --> 45:25.222
Because there's a small chance
I might die a violent death.

45:26.922 --> 45:28.858
I can see you!

45:28.891 --> 45:30.527
No kissing in the playground.

45:30.559 --> 45:32.295
Sorry, miss.

45:49.045 --> 45:50.947
They're very nice.

45:52.148 --> 45:53.950
They're the nicest
artificial breasts

45:53.983 --> 45:56.419
anyone has ever given me.

45:56.452 --> 45:58.555
I'll bet they're
the <i>only</i> artificial breasts

45:58.588 --> 46:00.157
you've ever received.

46:00.190 --> 46:02.159
That's true.

46:02.192 --> 46:04.027
I made them myself.

46:04.059 --> 46:06.061
It's just that...

46:06.094 --> 46:08.030
..you've mentioned, you know,

46:08.063 --> 46:10.466
you were worried about...

46:10.500 --> 46:12.936
..you know...

46:12.969 --> 46:16.039
..things not happening...
you know...

46:16.072 --> 46:18.375
..around there.

46:18.407 --> 46:21.110
<i>I couldn't remember
mentioning my lack of breasts</i>

46:21.143 --> 46:24.079
<i>to Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension.</i>

46:24.112 --> 46:25.248
<i>But then again,</i>

46:25.280 --> 46:28.317
<i>I can't remember everything
I've ever said.</i>

46:28.351 --> 46:30.452
So I did some research
on the internet

46:30.485 --> 46:32.489
about what they
should be made of.

46:32.521 --> 46:35.458
Then it was a simple matter
of engineering.

46:35.490 --> 46:38.027
They inflate.

46:40.329 --> 46:42.998
So you can go from...

46:44.400 --> 46:45.836
..to...

46:50.239 --> 46:51.407
Whatever you want.

46:51.440 --> 46:56.012
And, in an emergency,
pull this.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.416
Oh, and my facsimile mother
said I was mad.

47:00.449 --> 47:02.852
She insisted
I get you something else.

47:08.458 --> 47:12.429
Thank you, Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension.

47:13.663 --> 47:15.565
They are great presents.

47:42.025 --> 47:44.561
- Is there a me in your world?
- What?

47:44.594 --> 47:48.298
A Candice Phee
in your other dimension?

47:48.331 --> 47:50.934
You said there was
an infinity of Earths,

47:50.967 --> 47:55.172
and therefore,
an infinity of 'me's.

47:56.338 --> 47:59.476
<i>I like the idea
of a normal me somewhere,</i>

47:59.509 --> 48:05.048
<i>doing normal things
and thinking normal thoughts.</i>

48:05.081 --> 48:08.485
You must be somewhere,
but I haven't met you yet.

48:08.518 --> 48:11.054
Will you do me a favour
if you get back?

48:11.086 --> 48:13.989
- <i>When</i> I get back.
- Yes.

48:14.023 --> 48:18.260
Look me up and say hello,
from me.

48:18.293 --> 48:20.230
- Let's go!
- Hooray!

48:46.356 --> 48:49.259
- Alright, we're here.
- True.

48:49.291 --> 48:51.661
Though, when you think about it,
we're always here.

48:51.693 --> 48:55.364
I mean, at any given moment,
here is where we must be.

48:55.398 --> 48:58.300
You can't go from there without
travelling from here to there,

48:58.333 --> 49:00.336
and every small movement
is a small here.

49:00.369 --> 49:03.440
OK, Candice,
I know it's your birthday

49:03.472 --> 49:05.342
but can you stop, please?

49:05.375 --> 49:08.010
We're here,
so what do you want to do?

49:08.043 --> 49:09.578
I mean, do you want to...

49:09.612 --> 49:12.215
..have your birthday party
in a car park?

49:12.248 --> 49:14.952
I mean, honestly,
nothing would surprise me.

49:15.717 --> 49:17.420
- Come here!
- What?

49:17.452 --> 49:18.588
What are you doing?

49:18.621 --> 49:20.356
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

49:20.389 --> 49:23.359
It is her birthday.
Stop being so miserable.

49:23.393 --> 49:25.195
Why are we here?

49:25.228 --> 49:26.695
To perform a miracle.

49:26.728 --> 49:28.630
I'm not the miserable one.
<i>You</i> are the...

49:28.664 --> 49:31.468
- Let her have her day.
- <i>You're</i> the miserable one. OK?

49:31.501 --> 49:33.403
You're constantly miserable.

49:33.436 --> 49:34.738
- Me?
- Yes, you.

49:34.771 --> 49:36.539
- You are.
- You are.

49:39.409 --> 49:41.111
Just get it together.

49:46.282 --> 49:49.052
Douglas, do you think
there is such a thing

49:49.085 --> 49:50.253
as a pleasant death?

49:50.286 --> 49:52.422
Maybe being sucked
into a black hole.

49:53.322 --> 49:54.791
I'm not sure it'd be pleasant,

49:54.824 --> 49:56.693
but it would be amazingly cool.

49:56.726 --> 49:58.494
You see, as you approach
the event horizon...

49:58.527 --> 50:00.062
I thought not.

50:01.130 --> 50:02.465
Promise me

50:02.498 --> 50:04.367
that whatever happens
in the next few minutes,

50:04.400 --> 50:05.735
you will do absolutely nothing.

50:05.768 --> 50:07.403
What do you mean?

50:07.436 --> 50:10.039
I thought it fairly
plain, but I'll rephrase.

50:10.072 --> 50:12.808
Promise me that whatever happens
in the next few minutes,

50:12.842 --> 50:14.510
you will do absolutely nothing.

50:14.543 --> 50:16.278
- Like what?
- Like nothing.

50:16.311 --> 50:18.547
No. I mean, what will happen?

50:18.581 --> 50:20.216
Something.

50:20.248 --> 50:22.684
Oh. Unless no-one does anything.

50:22.717 --> 50:24.286
If that happens, I want you

50:24.320 --> 50:26.088
to leap around
like a mountain goat,

50:26.121 --> 50:28.690
screaming and pointing
and generally being dramatic.

50:28.724 --> 50:30.559
- Got it?
- No.

50:30.592 --> 50:32.795
Good. We're on
the same wavelength.

50:37.733 --> 50:40.637
Rich Uncle Brian!

50:41.536 --> 50:43.505
Pumpkin!

50:43.539 --> 50:46.142
Happy birthday, my girl!
Happy birthday!

50:46.175 --> 50:47.644
Thank you!

50:48.777 --> 50:50.446
Hello.

51:00.289 --> 51:02.192
Candice!

51:02.224 --> 51:03.692
Jim, she can't swim!

51:03.726 --> 51:05.628
- Candice!
- Pumpkin, I'm coming!

51:09.364 --> 51:10.632
Oh!

51:10.666 --> 51:13.470
Aagh!
What is wrong with you?!

51:17.539 --> 51:20.376
<i>O is for 'oblivion'.</i>

51:22.378 --> 51:24.646
<i>They say that
when you're dying,</i>

51:24.679 --> 51:27.583
<i>your whole life flashes
before your eyes.</i>

51:30.318 --> 51:32.755
<i>It's a slight exaggeration.</i>

51:32.788 --> 51:36.860
<i>I just saw Mum before
she had forgotten how to smile</i>

51:36.893 --> 51:40.297
<i>and Dad and Rich Uncle Brian
laughing together.</i>

51:43.398 --> 51:45.467
Where is she?! Candice!

51:45.501 --> 51:47.804
- Candice!
- Candice!

51:47.836 --> 51:50.306
Here! Mr Phee!

51:50.338 --> 51:51.875
Candice!

51:52.708 --> 51:54.376
<i>I saw Sky too.</i>

51:55.677 --> 51:57.579
<i>She was the age
she would be now.</i>

51:57.612 --> 52:00.382
<i>I don't want to get mystical,</i>

52:00.416 --> 52:03.219
<i>but my dead sister was
telling me to do something.</i>

52:03.251 --> 52:04.420
Candice!

52:04.452 --> 52:07.490
<i>That and Douglas Benson's
birthday present.</i>

52:12.295 --> 52:13.896
Pumpkin!

52:13.929 --> 52:15.865
Candice!

52:20.635 --> 52:23.172
- Candice!
- Douglas!

52:25.340 --> 52:28.545
<i>How would I rate the success of
my plan to reconcile my family?</i>

52:31.347 --> 52:33.249
<i>On a scale of 0 to 10...</i>

52:36.219 --> 52:38.253
<i>..around -15.</i>

52:39.554 --> 52:43.192
<i>Such a drastic failure
calls for some drastic action.</i>

52:43.226 --> 52:45.795
I would like to see
Mr Dawson, please.

52:47.829 --> 52:49.731
Well, do you have
an appointment?

52:49.764 --> 52:53.435
No, but, um, tell him
Candice Phee is here.

52:53.469 --> 52:54.905
He will want to see me.

52:56.539 --> 52:59.609
<i>This always works
in the movies.</i>

52:59.641 --> 53:02.377
<i>I have no idea why.</i>

53:02.411 --> 53:04.480
What can I do for you?

53:04.512 --> 53:08.250
I want you to take legal action
against my parents

53:08.284 --> 53:09.852
so I am removed from their house

53:09.885 --> 53:12.388
and placed under
local authority care.

53:12.420 --> 53:16.326
In effect, I want to divorce
them and find foster-parents.

53:16.358 --> 53:20.396
You do know I deal in property
conveyancing, don't you?

53:24.032 --> 53:27.836
Why are lawyers in New York
very young, intelligent,

53:27.869 --> 53:31.507
exceptionally well dressed
and bursting with enthusiasm?

53:31.539 --> 53:34.244
Based upon
my television viewing,

53:34.277 --> 53:35.912
you can't throw a stone
in New York

53:35.945 --> 53:37.647
without hitting a lawyer

53:37.679 --> 53:41.717
prepared to take on a juicy case
like the one I presented.

53:41.751 --> 53:43.286
What did he do?

53:43.318 --> 53:45.954
He asked me to leave.
He showed me the door.

53:48.891 --> 53:51.360
What are you doing here,
Candice?

53:52.661 --> 53:55.297
I'm here to stop you
killing yourself.

53:55.331 --> 53:57.767
Don't worry. I won't.

53:57.800 --> 54:01.403
Besides, if I can't get back
to my own dimension,

54:01.436 --> 54:03.472
there'll be some compensation.

54:03.505 --> 54:05.241
What do you mean?

54:06.342 --> 54:07.677
I love you.

54:11.614 --> 54:13.483
Ew!

54:18.521 --> 54:20.990
You've been giving it apples.

54:21.023 --> 54:23.626
Approximately seven so far.

54:26.695 --> 54:29.565
I'm sorry.

54:29.597 --> 54:33.603
Would you mind repeating that...
nice thing you just said?

54:35.503 --> 54:36.972
I love you.

54:55.623 --> 55:00.062
<i>As you can imagine,
all this kissing is exciting.</i>

55:01.797 --> 55:03.967
<i>In a distasteful way.</i>

55:07.369 --> 55:10.906
<i>And I feel I have made
a dramatic start to my teens.</i>

55:16.579 --> 55:22.352
<i>But I have realised,
quite suddenly,</i>

55:22.385 --> 55:25.588
<i>that I don't want Douglas
Benson from Another Dimension</i>

55:25.621 --> 55:27.324
<i>to leave.</i>

55:35.998 --> 55:38.400
Ha! Get a load of this!

55:38.434 --> 55:40.803
The freakards
have gotten together.

55:40.835 --> 55:43.138
Oh, my God!

55:45.039 --> 55:47.876
Ignore her, Candice.
She's jealous.

55:47.909 --> 55:49.578
Jealous?

55:49.612 --> 55:50.713
Jealous?!

55:50.746 --> 55:53.983
- Of what, you...
- ..freakard?!

55:55.050 --> 55:56.586
Jen, if you're going to shout,

55:56.619 --> 55:59.422
it might be an idea
to dispose of your gum.

55:59.454 --> 56:01.423
Accidents have been known
to happen, you know.

56:01.456 --> 56:04.426
Shut up, moron! Shut the hell up!

56:04.460 --> 56:05.862
What is going on here?!

56:08.431 --> 56:10.833
Sit down this instant!

56:19.641 --> 56:23.145
My name is Miss Cowie
and I am a relief teacher.

56:23.179 --> 56:25.081
This does not mean that I have

56:25.114 --> 56:27.983
an invisible target
between my eyes

56:28.016 --> 56:31.721
or that you should confuse me
with a human being.

56:33.054 --> 56:35.590
Miss Bamford
is unfortunately ill

56:35.623 --> 56:37.459
and will be away for a few days.

56:37.492 --> 56:39.594
In the meantime...

56:39.628 --> 56:41.497
..I am in charge!

56:41.530 --> 56:45.034
You are to work on your
Open Day presentations,

56:45.067 --> 56:48.972
and you will work in silence.

56:51.474 --> 56:52.875
Right?!

56:58.213 --> 56:59.916
Pick her up.

57:03.818 --> 57:05.954
Afternoon, Mr Weigard.

57:13.228 --> 57:18.533
<i>T is for 'Talk' -
with a capital T.</i>

57:18.567 --> 57:22.170
We had a phone call earlier
today from a Mr Dawson.

57:22.204 --> 57:25.106
Ah. That's nice.

57:25.139 --> 57:29.612
Not really. He said
you wanted to divorce us.

57:29.644 --> 57:31.646
Apparently, the only reason
he didn't take the case

57:31.679 --> 57:33.548
is because he's
a house conveyancer.

57:33.581 --> 57:36.952
House conveyancing?

57:38.086 --> 57:40.222
Want to tell me
what that was all about?

57:40.255 --> 57:41.958
No, thanks.

57:41.990 --> 57:43.525
But I think you should know

57:43.559 --> 57:45.761
that Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension

57:45.793 --> 57:47.163
thinks he's solved
his problem...

57:47.195 --> 57:49.498
Do you really want
to divorce us?

57:49.532 --> 57:51.067
Yes.

57:52.635 --> 57:54.103
No.

57:55.771 --> 57:57.740
I don't know!

57:57.773 --> 58:00.076
I was trying
to save our family.

58:00.108 --> 58:03.011
I thought you
and Rich Uncle Brian

58:03.045 --> 58:04.847
would bond over rescuing me

58:04.880 --> 58:08.217
and then we'd all be reunited
as a family again.

58:08.250 --> 58:10.552
You think our family
needs saving?

58:10.585 --> 58:12.288
- Yes!
- Right.

58:12.320 --> 58:15.290
And how do you think drowning
yourself or divorcing us

58:15.324 --> 58:17.193
is gonna help?

58:17.226 --> 58:20.230
Really prefer to go and live
with a bunch of strangers?

58:21.130 --> 58:23.166
You <i>are</i> strangers.

58:27.735 --> 58:30.071
Dad, do you have to watch
your plane all the time?

58:30.105 --> 58:32.041
Well, I would have thought
that was obvious, Candice.

58:32.074 --> 58:34.577
If I don't, I will lose control
and it will crash.

58:36.010 --> 58:38.547
Isn't that the same
with families?

59:05.139 --> 59:06.708
Over the next few days,

59:06.742 --> 59:09.812
you are to practise
your Open Day presentations.

59:09.844 --> 59:12.881
I have paired you up
with another class member

59:12.914 --> 59:14.784
and suggest if any of you
are having any trouble,

59:14.817 --> 59:18.320
you start by interviewing
each other.

59:19.855 --> 59:24.226
Find out the important aspects
of your partner's life.

59:28.063 --> 59:30.800
Henrietta Hoe and Josie Turner.

59:30.833 --> 59:32.001
Yes!

59:32.034 --> 59:34.302
Kyle Phipps and Jack Briars.

59:34.335 --> 59:37.372
Candice Phee and Jen Marshall.

59:37.405 --> 59:40.041
Minka Davies
and Phoebe Harrison.

59:40.074 --> 59:43.178
Ditz MacGyver
and Warren Peacock.

59:43.211 --> 59:45.847
Imelda Tinwhistle
and Andy Lemur.

59:45.880 --> 59:49.885
Millie Rockfish
and Douglas Benson.

59:51.019 --> 59:53.222
Financial advice, eh?

59:53.255 --> 59:57.326
You once told me you had
established a trust fund for me.

59:57.358 --> 59:58.860
When you're 21, it will mature.

59:58.893 --> 01:00:00.929
Why do I have to wait
until I'm 21?

01:00:00.963 --> 01:00:03.332
Well, you're 13, pumpkin.

01:00:03.364 --> 01:00:05.934
It's too young for
important financial decisions.

01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:07.235
You could waste the cash

01:00:07.268 --> 01:00:09.871
on smartphones or computers
or video games.

01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:11.374
Or, um...

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.942
Hmm.

01:00:13.976 --> 01:00:17.213
..other things.

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:20.750
Gel pens are the extent
of my impulse buying.

01:00:20.782 --> 01:00:21.983
That's true.

01:00:22.016 --> 01:00:23.184
But even so, there is

01:00:23.217 --> 01:00:24.953
significant money
already invested,

01:00:24.987 --> 01:00:27.322
and if all you're gonna spend
that money on is gel pens,

01:00:27.356 --> 01:00:29.759
why is there a problem
waiting until you turn 21?

01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:31.326
I want to withdraw some of it.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.695
I can buy you gel pens.

01:00:33.728 --> 01:00:35.664
It's not for gel pens.

01:00:35.697 --> 01:00:36.998
Well...

01:00:50.378 --> 01:00:53.982
Douglas Benson from Another
Dimension is in love with me.

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:56.686
Love!

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.987
What makes you think
he's from another dimension?

01:00:59.021 --> 01:01:02.792
It's not what I think.
It's what he believes.

01:01:02.824 --> 01:01:05.794
You know about p-branes
and M-theory?

01:01:05.827 --> 01:01:08.230
- Mmm.
- Multiverses?

01:01:09.797 --> 01:01:11.399
Can you explain it to me?

01:01:11.432 --> 01:01:14.469
Something like there are
an infinite number of Earths

01:01:14.503 --> 01:01:16.706
and each will be
slightly different.

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:20.943
Each one with another Candice.
Which is fascinating.

01:01:20.976 --> 01:01:23.179
- Mmm.
- Huh.

01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:27.083
Can you invite that Douglas
Benson to dinner tonight?

01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:28.818
I'd like to have
a chat with him.

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.253
- Oh, God.
- I'll cook!

01:01:31.286 --> 01:01:34.724
He has an appointment with
destiny every night at 6:30.

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:37.159
But he might be able to come
after that.

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:46.835
What's wrong?

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:50.006
Nothing. I've just never
been in here before.

01:01:55.443 --> 01:01:57.813
You are a terrific
eye-roller, Jen.

01:01:57.846 --> 01:02:00.148
And you're a terrific
pain in the butt.

01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:02.317
That doesn't actually
make any sense.

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:05.855
But anyway,
where do you want to sit?

01:02:05.887 --> 01:02:08.257
Anywhere away from you, Essen.

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:10.058
Not possible, I'm afraid.

01:02:10.092 --> 01:02:12.294
What about down that aisle?

01:02:15.063 --> 01:02:16.432
Shh!

01:02:31.445 --> 01:02:33.114
Tell me about yourself, Jen.

01:02:33.148 --> 01:02:34.517
What's there to say?

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.119
Tell me about your family.

01:02:37.152 --> 01:02:39.088
Mother - drunk a lot.

01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:41.056
Dad - God knows where.

01:02:41.088 --> 01:02:44.893
Brother's a freakard.
No offence.

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:47.229
Doesn't sound like
a happy family life.

01:02:47.262 --> 01:02:49.865
Yeah? So what?

01:02:49.898 --> 01:02:53.501
I bet you have one of the
families that you see on TV.

01:02:53.534 --> 01:02:55.436
All loving and drooling
over school reports

01:02:55.469 --> 01:02:57.005
and going on holidays.

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.807
I live in the real world, Essen,

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.109
and it's not as pretty
as the pictures.

01:03:03.277 --> 01:03:05.547
What do you want to be
when you leave school?

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:08.584
Are you for real?
I can't think that far ahead.

01:03:08.617 --> 01:03:11.086
I just want to get out
of this crappy place.

01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:14.390
It's crap. All of it.

01:03:14.422 --> 01:03:15.924
But you're not, are you, Jen?

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.059
What?

01:03:17.092 --> 01:03:18.460
Crap.

01:03:18.492 --> 01:03:21.396
Yeah, I am. I'm more crap
than anything else.

01:03:21.429 --> 01:03:24.899
I'm crap at schoolwork.
Name a subject - I'm crap at it.

01:03:24.932 --> 01:03:27.969
- I could help you.
- What do you mean?

01:03:28.003 --> 01:03:30.306
I could help you
with schoolwork.

01:03:30.338 --> 01:03:32.273
Your friends don't have to know.

01:03:32.306 --> 01:03:34.375
Why would you do that?

01:03:34.409 --> 01:03:35.978
Because I like you.

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:38.581
You're so weird, Essen.
You like me?

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:41.916
Why do you like me, huh?
I treat you like crap.

01:03:41.949 --> 01:03:43.284
What is it with you?

01:03:43.318 --> 01:03:46.088
The worse you get treated,
the nicer you try to be?

01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:48.490
Mum's like that with
the men she brings home.

01:03:48.523 --> 01:03:50.492
She's a loser, and so are you.

01:03:50.525 --> 01:03:53.996
Possibly, but I'd still like to
help you with your schoolwork.

01:03:54.028 --> 01:03:55.597
- Ugh.
- Shh!

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:05.507
I hope you enjoy the food,
Douglas Benson.

01:04:05.539 --> 01:04:07.909
- It's...
- Sausages, eggs and chips.

01:04:07.943 --> 01:04:10.246
It's the only thing
he can cook.

01:04:10.278 --> 01:04:12.514
You think this is
the only thing I can cook?

01:04:12.547 --> 01:04:14.617
- Mm-hm.
- It's great.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.018
Thank you, Mr Phee.

01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:18.219
I think it's wonderful.

01:04:18.253 --> 01:04:20.088
Well, bon appétit.

01:04:25.159 --> 01:04:26.295
Mr Phee?

01:04:26.327 --> 01:04:27.963
Yes, Douglas Benson?

01:04:27.996 --> 01:04:30.166
I would like to marry
your daughter.

01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:35.069
With your blessing, of course.

01:04:35.103 --> 01:04:36.873
Excuse me?

01:04:38.072 --> 01:04:39.942
I love Candice.

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:43.311
Yes.

01:04:43.344 --> 01:04:46.981
Candice is, uh...
she's only 13 years old.

01:04:47.014 --> 01:04:50.152
Uh, you don't think that's
a little young for marriage,

01:04:50.184 --> 01:04:51.452
do you, Douglas Benson?

01:04:51.485 --> 01:04:53.188
I don't mean right now,
Mr Phee.

01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:54.356
Oh, good.

01:04:54.389 --> 01:04:56.258
Maybe in
three or four years' time?

01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:58.460
Uh-huh.

01:04:58.492 --> 01:05:02.563
And what are you going to bring
to the table, Douglas Benson?

01:05:02.597 --> 01:05:04.033
Pardon?

01:05:04.065 --> 01:05:06.201
A herd of goats?
A flock of sheep?

01:05:06.233 --> 01:05:08.136
I mean, what have you got?

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.672
I don't think
I could let her go

01:05:09.704 --> 01:05:12.340
for less than
a working water buffalo

01:05:12.373 --> 01:05:14.242
and a couple of suckling pigs.

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:27.689
So that creates the linkage
to the other dimensions.

01:05:27.722 --> 01:05:31.059
Tell me again how each new
dimension comes into existence.

01:05:31.092 --> 01:05:35.196
Well, the way I understand it
is there's an infinite number.

01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:39.434
And whenever something changes,
a new possibility then exists.

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:43.571
And then the universe unfolds
against that possibility.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:54.215
<i>Dad spent 45 minutes
grilling Douglas Benson</i>

01:05:54.248 --> 01:05:56.751
<i>on every aspect
of other dimensions.</i>

01:05:56.784 --> 01:05:59.087
Just in the simplest
possible terms.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.724
So, everything
that could possibly happen...

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:06.327
See you later, Douglas
Benson from Another Dimension!

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.396
Bye, Candice!

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:14.435
What was <i>that</i> all about?

01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:16.237
Think of a computer program

01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:19.708
that allowed you to create
alternative paths

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.509
to the one you've taken
in this life,

01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:25.381
by changing decisions both
inside and outside your control.

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.649
Now, what if that program

01:06:27.681 --> 01:06:31.119
allowed you to create
an alternative you

01:06:31.152 --> 01:06:33.521
based on the information
you've fed in,

01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:38.360
and then allows you
to communicate with her?

01:06:39.827 --> 01:06:43.164
And you could write
that program, Dad?

01:06:44.065 --> 01:06:45.199
I could.

01:06:45.233 --> 01:06:46.501
Yeah, I could. I could.

01:06:46.534 --> 01:06:48.237
I don't know where the money's
gonna come from.

01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:49.771
I've got no idea at this point.

01:06:49.804 --> 01:06:52.306
But, you know, money comes.
When you need it, it comes.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.110
I mean, it hasn't been coming
lately, but it will come...

01:06:55.143 --> 01:06:56.811
<i>V is for 'vision'.</i>

01:06:56.844 --> 01:06:59.814
<i>I didn't understand
the technical details</i>

01:06:59.847 --> 01:07:01.817
<i>but I knew it was brilliant.</i>

01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:04.385
<i>Unfortunately,
he made me promise</i>

01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:06.821
<i>not to speak to anyone
about it.</i>

01:07:06.855 --> 01:07:09.724
<i>And I never break my promises.</i>

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:17.332
Hi, Jen Marshall!

01:07:17.364 --> 01:07:19.300
Come in quick
so no-one sees you.

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:21.636
That way, you won't
become an outcast.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.072
Whatever. Let's just
get this thing done, OK?

01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:35.717
What's the assignment?

01:07:38.586 --> 01:07:41.824
My favourite! Algebra!

01:07:49.797 --> 01:07:53.434

Jim, I don't... I don't

It's... it's a star.

01:09:41.274 --> 01:09:43.679
So, that's the official
certificate of ownership.

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.447
There's another document
in there

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.448
which shows you a picture
of the star system

01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:51.752
with your... your star circled.

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:55.423
And you named this after me?

01:09:56.457 --> 01:09:57.826
Not quite.

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:01.463
Not quite?

01:10:01.496 --> 01:10:04.766
I named it... Frances Phee.

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:08.936
Oh.

01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:10.573
'Cause I thought...

01:10:11.472 --> 01:10:13.307
..you know, um...

01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:17.279
..when we'd look up at the
stars, we'll know she's there.

01:10:19.747 --> 01:10:21.817
Yeah, I know where she is, Jim.

01:10:22.951 --> 01:10:26.320
Sweetheart, I know.
I know. I just...

01:10:26.354 --> 01:10:27.923
I just thought...

01:10:30.692 --> 01:10:32.728
Oh, it's probably a bad idea.

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:35.731
I think it's
a beautiful idea, Dad!

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:39.268
Because I don't think
Sky's in that cemetery.

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.237
- I think she's...
- Oh, please, enough!

01:10:45.939 --> 01:10:48.476
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.679
It's fine.
Let's... let's... let's just...

01:10:50.712 --> 01:10:52.348
It's fine, darling.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:55.684
My turn!

01:10:58.353 --> 01:10:59.989
- Oh!
- Three presents in one.

01:11:01.488 --> 01:11:02.724
Thank you.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:10.332
That's a beautiful room,
Candice.

01:11:10.364 --> 01:11:13.501
It's a lovely chandelier.
The two lovely chandeliers.

01:11:13.534 --> 01:11:15.037
They're yours.

01:11:15.069 --> 01:11:18.773
Well, not forever.
Only for a week in October.

01:11:18.806 --> 01:11:21.943
It's a picture of a suite
in a Nashville hotel.

01:11:21.975 --> 01:11:23.612
Just off Ryman Alley.

01:11:23.645 --> 01:11:26.481
In the envelopes are
three tickets for the flights,

01:11:26.514 --> 01:11:29.885
and the card contains
$2,000 of spending money.

01:11:29.917 --> 01:11:31.987
What?

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:35.657
You heard. It's all there.

01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:40.528
Alright. OK. I'm assuming
your uncle had a hand in this.

01:11:40.561 --> 01:11:42.396
Candice... you're 13 years old.

01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:44.900
You can't spend this kind
of money on me... on us.

01:11:44.932 --> 01:11:46.600
The tickets are non-refundable.

01:11:46.634 --> 01:11:48.770
Oh, God!

01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:54.542
Rich Uncle Brian tried to talk
me out of it, but I insisted.

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.411
And he can never say no to me.

01:11:56.444 --> 01:12:00.749
Plus, it's my money, and I can
spend it on whatever I want.

01:12:00.782 --> 01:12:03.385
And... I want this.

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:05.487
Candice, we can't go.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.622
You're damn right we can't go!

01:12:07.654 --> 01:12:11.525
God, Candice, you can't
fix things with money.

01:12:11.559 --> 01:12:14.628
Do you understand that? Do...?
You are out of control!

01:12:14.662 --> 01:12:17.099
- Jim.
- Do you know what?

01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:19.033
I'm actually gonna
go and see Brian

01:12:19.067 --> 01:12:20.769
and give him
a piece of my mind.

01:12:20.801 --> 01:12:22.804
Jim, sit down! Don't you
do this to me on my birthday.

01:12:22.837 --> 01:12:25.607
How much must that have
cost? And he's giving that...

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.676
You know what?
- ..as... as charity to us!

01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:29.377
- Let's just...
- You can't blame me for that!

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:30.612
What were you thinking?!

01:12:30.645 --> 01:12:32.080
I don't need a star
named after Frances!

01:12:33.448 --> 01:12:34.950
- Jesus, Jim!
- I'm sorry!

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:37.052
I'm sorry about the star,
alright?!

01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:05.780
Mum isn't depressed about
her birthday presents, is she?

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:07.548
No.

01:13:07.582 --> 01:13:10.685
Not at all. Absolutely not.

01:13:10.717 --> 01:13:13.688
That means yes, doesn't it?

01:13:15.122 --> 01:13:18.058
Uh... well...

01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:20.728
We are going to Nashville,
though, Dad.

01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:22.063
No, we're not.

01:13:22.095 --> 01:13:24.598
Your mum and I
really appreciate the gesture,

01:13:24.631 --> 01:13:26.500
but it is not going to happen.

01:13:26.533 --> 01:13:27.668
I'm sorry.

01:13:27.702 --> 01:13:29.538
It is.

01:13:34.609 --> 01:13:36.545
How's your program going?

01:13:40.148 --> 01:13:43.618
Uh, well, if you think of
the Great Wall of China,

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:45.753
I've laid the first brick.

01:13:45.787 --> 01:13:47.021
Hmm.

01:13:48.555 --> 01:13:50.157
- Dad?
- Hmm?

01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:52.461
I know you've got
a billion bricks to lay,

01:13:52.493 --> 01:13:55.764
but would you take me
to lunch tomorrow?

01:13:55.796 --> 01:13:57.598
Just the two of us?

01:13:57.631 --> 01:13:59.768
Uh...

01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:01.737
It is a Saturday.

01:14:03.203 --> 01:14:04.672
Well...

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.610
..W is for 'wedding'.

01:14:08.643 --> 01:14:12.180
You know, we could discuss
your wedding plans.

01:14:12.212 --> 01:14:16.650
You know, how many bridesmaids
you want, floral arrangements,

01:14:16.684 --> 01:14:18.020
that sort of thing.

01:14:20.587 --> 01:14:22.724
Not funny?

01:14:22.756 --> 01:14:25.226
Not at all.

01:14:39.239 --> 01:14:41.809
Dad's rules are clear
about eating in here.

01:14:41.842 --> 01:14:44.246
And there's nothing
about kissing,

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:46.781
but I suspect
he'll frown upon it.

01:14:46.814 --> 01:14:50.151
Nashville has got some
great things to see and do.

01:14:50.184 --> 01:14:52.921
- I've got exciting news, Candice.
- That's nice.

01:14:52.953 --> 01:14:54.622
I think I know
where I've been going wrong.

01:14:54.655 --> 01:14:56.291
It's the nature
of the tesseract.

01:14:56.323 --> 01:14:59.159
I think I made a serious error
with one of the dimensions.

01:14:59.193 --> 01:15:00.595
It would explain everything.

01:15:00.627 --> 01:15:02.730
What does that mean?

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:06.001
It means I think I can
get back... this afternoon.

01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:10.105
I want you to come with me.

01:15:10.137 --> 01:15:13.542
I'm trying to save my family.

01:15:13.574 --> 01:15:16.310
- I can't abandon them.
- I thought you'd say that.

01:15:16.344 --> 01:15:19.280
I know how much
your family means to you.

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:26.154
Will you watch me?

01:15:26.186 --> 01:15:29.157
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:31.192
Because I don't want you to go.

01:15:31.225 --> 01:15:34.530
It breaks my heart
to think I'll be leaving you.

01:15:35.296 --> 01:15:36.965
Then don't.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.268
Oh.

01:15:40.301 --> 01:15:42.003
Uh... hi, Douglas.

01:15:42.036 --> 01:15:45.541
Uh, Candice,
are you ready for lunch?

01:15:55.283 --> 01:15:57.219
I will be there.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:05.226
Have you and Douglas Benson
had a fight?

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.796
Much worse.

01:16:07.828 --> 01:16:10.130
I don't understand
teenage love.

01:16:10.163 --> 01:16:12.900
I thought it was
something desirable.

01:16:12.934 --> 01:16:14.735
But it's horrible.

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:34.088
- Don't want to sit opposite?
- No, thanks.

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:35.890
I'll get a crick in my neck
talking to you.

01:16:35.922 --> 01:16:38.292
- That's fine.
- For you, maybe.

01:16:38.326 --> 01:16:40.996
Right, what have we got?

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:43.799
Schnitzel this,
schnitzel that...

01:16:46.701 --> 01:16:48.336
- What the hell?
- Hello, Jim.

01:16:48.368 --> 01:16:51.139
OK, let me up, Candice.
We're going.

01:16:51.171 --> 01:16:52.873
No, we're staying.

01:16:52.907 --> 01:16:54.943
Are you ready to order?

01:16:56.944 --> 01:16:59.314
I'll give you more time.

01:16:59.346 --> 01:17:01.081
Oh, so this is your doing?
Just let me out, please.

01:17:01.114 --> 01:17:02.250
We need to talk.

01:17:02.283 --> 01:17:03.785
We have nothing
to say to each other!

01:17:03.818 --> 01:17:04.985
Oh, I think that we do.

01:17:05.019 --> 01:17:07.188
What you think is
of no interest to me.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.889
Leave. Now.

01:17:08.922 --> 01:17:10.724
I want to talk
about your program.

01:17:10.757 --> 01:17:13.662
The multidimensional
social media idea.

01:17:13.694 --> 01:17:17.865
OK, I haven't mentioned that
to anyone except you.

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:19.267
I didn't speak about it, Dad.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.270
I wrote it down and showed it
to Rich Uncle Brian.

01:17:22.302 --> 01:17:25.305
- I didn't break my promise.
- What?

01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:28.743
You told me not to speak
to anyone about it. I haven't.

01:17:28.775 --> 01:17:29.978
But you didn't say anything

01:17:30.011 --> 01:17:32.080
about letting someone
read about it.

01:17:32.113 --> 01:17:35.316
I'm literal, Dad.
You know that.

01:17:35.349 --> 01:17:38.920
Yes. Yes.
You're also smart, Candice.

01:17:38.953 --> 01:17:41.189
So don't play
the 'literal' card with me.

01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:43.224
You know what this meant to me!

01:17:43.256 --> 01:17:44.992
I... It would have been fine

01:17:45.025 --> 01:17:47.761
if you'd told a friend or
something, but to tell <i>him?!</i>

01:17:47.795 --> 01:17:51.132
He's... he's robbed me once!
Do you understand?

01:17:51.164 --> 01:17:52.833
He's gonna rob me again!

01:17:52.867 --> 01:17:54.936
I am not going to rob you, Jim.

01:17:54.969 --> 01:17:57.137
Would I be here
if that were the case?

01:17:57.171 --> 01:17:58.873
Don't raise your voice
to Candice - it...

01:17:58.905 --> 01:18:00.307
Oh, excuse me? I'm her father!

01:18:00.341 --> 01:18:02.844
Don't you tell me
what I can and cannot do!

01:18:02.877 --> 01:18:05.380
And another thing -
how dare you give Candice

01:18:05.412 --> 01:18:07.815
her trust fund money
for a holiday?

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:08.949
How dare you?!

01:18:08.983 --> 01:18:10.217
I don't want to talk
about that, Jim.

01:18:10.251 --> 01:18:12.287
Not here, not now,
not in front of...

01:18:12.319 --> 01:18:14.121
Candice.

01:18:14.154 --> 01:18:17.224
OK, good. 'Cause I don't want
to hear about it, alright?

01:18:17.257 --> 01:18:19.860
Just leave, Brian.

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:23.864
You're a stubborn mule, Jim! OK?

01:18:23.898 --> 01:18:26.434
Listen, the trip to Nashville
was never going to be funded

01:18:26.466 --> 01:18:28.068
by Candice's trust fund.

01:18:28.101 --> 01:18:29.970
As if I would do
a thing like that.

01:18:30.003 --> 01:18:32.372
- Well, who was gonna pay?
- I was.

01:18:32.405 --> 01:18:36.277
I would die before I accepted
charity from you, Brian!

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.979
Huh.

01:18:38.011 --> 01:18:40.981
I can't believe
that you did this to me.

01:18:41.015 --> 01:18:44.985
You've got your bike. OK?
Just go!

01:18:45.019 --> 01:18:46.320
Now!

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:49.356
Jim, just... Mate, listen.

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:53.427
Just give me five minutes. You
need to hear what I'm offering.

01:18:53.461 --> 01:18:55.797
..around a table
with our lawyers, and my...

01:18:55.829 --> 01:18:57.798
OK? I don't trust you.
I can't trust you.

01:18:57.832 --> 01:18:59.400
- Don't be like that.
- I can't!

01:18:59.432 --> 01:19:01.269
- This time it's different.
- How can you expect me...?

01:19:01.301 --> 01:19:02.903
- This time it's different!
- Why?

01:19:02.936 --> 01:19:04.338
What makes this time different?

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.274
- Things have changed.
- What's changed? What?

01:19:06.306 --> 01:19:08.376
The business has changed.
The way we do things.

01:19:08.408 --> 01:19:10.144
- Have <i>you</i> changed?
- I need to know...

01:19:10.177 --> 01:19:13.314
I need <i>you</i> to say
that <i>you</i> have changed

01:19:13.346 --> 01:19:14.948
and you're not gonna...

01:19:14.981 --> 01:19:18.819
OK, OK. I accept your apology.
We'll agree to disagree.

01:19:18.853 --> 01:19:20.387
It'll be just like
the old times.

01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:22.257
What's the deal
on the table?

01:19:22.289 --> 01:19:23.992
I promise you, Jim,
there will be...

01:19:24.024 --> 01:19:26.260
Douglas! Oh!

01:20:35.195 --> 01:20:36.930
Douglas!

01:20:36.963 --> 01:20:38.533
Don't!

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.406
Douglas!

01:20:48.475 --> 01:20:50.411
Douglas? Douglas!

01:20:50.444 --> 01:20:52.480
Douglas?

01:20:52.512 --> 01:20:54.149
Douglas!

01:21:14.668 --> 01:21:17.572
Mum? I need you
to drive me to the hospital.

01:21:17.604 --> 01:21:19.039
What's wrong?

01:21:19.073 --> 01:21:21.276
Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension.

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:24.412
He jumped. I didn't stop him.
He's hurt.

01:21:24.444 --> 01:21:28.048
Oh, my God. Of course
I'll drive you to the hospital.

01:21:30.117 --> 01:21:31.253
Come on.

01:21:37.591 --> 01:21:39.961
..found unconscious
under a tree - suspected fall.

01:21:39.993 --> 01:21:41.528
Pupils aren't responding
to light.

01:21:41.561 --> 01:21:44.932
- Was anyone with him?
- A friend. A young girl.

01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:51.538
<i>Paging Dr Young to A&E.</i>

01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:06.421
Shh.

01:22:06.453 --> 01:22:09.957
It's OK. I'm here.

01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:11.592
I'm here, darling.

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:41.655
He regained
consciousness reasonably quickly.

01:22:43.056 --> 01:22:46.126
The X-rays and other tests
are normal.

01:22:46.159 --> 01:22:49.130
He'll probably just have a bad
headache for a day or two.

01:22:49.162 --> 01:22:52.700
- Sorry. I'm...
- Hey. Hey.

01:22:55.802 --> 01:22:57.505
It's OK.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.978
What you've been trying to do
for Douglas...

01:23:05.279 --> 01:23:08.149
He told me that you ride
your bike there to stop him.

01:23:11.385 --> 01:23:14.322
Things haven't been easy
since the accident.

01:23:14.354 --> 01:23:17.090
The... first one.

01:23:17.123 --> 01:23:21.728
He was, um...
a typical 12-year-old.

01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:25.198
The doctors told us
that a blow to the head

01:23:25.231 --> 01:23:29.037
can sometimes produce
personality changes.

01:23:29.069 --> 01:23:33.173
Now he has these delusions.

01:23:33.207 --> 01:23:35.710
He had friends before.

01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:39.613
But since then,
there's been no-one.

01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:48.122
I just want to say thank you
for being a friend to my son.

01:23:49.489 --> 01:23:51.525
You're very welcome.

01:23:58.431 --> 01:24:00.100
Come on.

01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:11.145
You can't...

01:24:11.177 --> 01:24:12.479
Where were you
gonna go off to?

01:24:12.512 --> 01:24:13.847
- You don't even know?
- I don't know!

01:24:13.881 --> 01:24:15.550
I don't know where
I'm gonna go. You can't...

01:24:25.826 --> 01:24:27.761
- I can help out, alright?
- It's not about that.

01:24:27.795 --> 01:24:29.864
Don't you understand?
It's not about that.

01:24:43.743 --> 01:24:46.113
I can't...
I can't do this.

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:57.492
I can't... I can't.

01:24:57.524 --> 01:25:00.460
I am an appalling mother! We
never should have had children!

01:25:00.493 --> 01:25:02.563
We need you. We want you
here, OK? We need you here.

01:25:02.595 --> 01:25:05.565
Can you stop...

01:25:06.867 --> 01:25:10.505
Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

01:25:10.537 --> 01:25:12.339
Oh! Hello!

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:16.310
Gavin, I need help.

01:25:16.342 --> 01:25:17.677
You? Need help?

01:25:17.711 --> 01:25:19.180
With my presentation.

01:25:19.212 --> 01:25:20.581
I thought you'd
nearly finished it.

01:25:20.613 --> 01:25:22.449
Things didn't turn out
the way I'd hoped.

01:25:22.483 --> 01:25:23.851
Ohh!

01:25:23.884 --> 01:25:26.421
I'm being serious.

01:25:28.354 --> 01:25:29.890
Ah!

01:25:29.923 --> 01:25:31.893
I'm listening.

01:25:31.926 --> 01:25:34.929
I need something with pizazz.

01:25:34.962 --> 01:25:37.598
1,000 balloons
or maybe even some fireworks.

01:25:37.631 --> 01:25:40.835
No, no, no, my darling!
You don't need all that!

01:25:40.868 --> 01:25:43.871
Engage the audience's
imagination.

01:25:43.904 --> 01:25:45.706
Remember the Bard.

01:25:45.738 --> 01:25:51.178
"Think when we talk of horses
that you see them

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:54.448
"Printing their proud hooves
in the receiving earth,

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.518
"For 'tis your thoughts
that now must deck our kings."

01:26:00.554 --> 01:26:03.190
You've just given me
a brilliant idea!

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:04.659
I did?

01:26:06.627 --> 01:26:09.564
I like to think
I can be inspiring.

01:26:11.564 --> 01:26:12.933
Hyup! Oh!

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:15.470
Uh!

01:26:28.248 --> 01:26:31.251
Get it. Get it. Get it.
Come on. Up! Up! Get it.

01:26:35.488 --> 01:26:36.890
Hi, Candice.

01:26:38.492 --> 01:26:40.228
I don't know whether to say

01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:42.830
"Hello, Douglas Benson
from Another Dimension"

01:26:42.863 --> 01:26:44.565
or "Hello, Douglas Benson".

01:26:44.597 --> 01:26:47.868
But... if you had gone,

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:52.872
then <i>this</i> Douglas Benson - you -
wouldn't know who I was.

01:26:52.905 --> 01:26:54.708
So it didn't work, then?

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:57.478
- What?
- Your portal?

01:26:57.511 --> 01:27:00.414
Wrong. It worked beautifully.

01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:01.849
I spent some time with my mum.

01:27:01.881 --> 01:27:03.884
I looked for you
in the other dimension

01:27:03.917 --> 01:27:05.419
and then I came back.

01:27:05.452 --> 01:27:06.721
Did you see me?

01:27:06.753 --> 01:27:08.890
The normal me?

01:27:10.556 --> 01:27:12.592
I don't want another Candice.

01:27:12.626 --> 01:27:14.762
That's why I came back.

01:27:14.795 --> 01:27:16.431
For you.

01:27:22.069 --> 01:27:23.704
Arrrrr!

01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:29.676
Would anyone care to take
this black spot to Blind Pew?

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:32.413
Arrrrr!

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:39.353
Good that you've all retained
a sense of humour

01:27:39.386 --> 01:27:41.289
in my absence.

01:27:46.793 --> 01:27:48.496
Now, we're due in the hall.

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:51.999
I trust you're all ready
to astound your parents

01:27:52.032 --> 01:27:54.467
with your skills
in public speaking.

01:27:54.501 --> 01:27:56.837
I know. I'm excited too.

01:27:56.869 --> 01:27:58.405
I thought it was next week!

01:27:58.439 --> 01:27:59.774
Well, off you go!

01:28:02.643 --> 01:28:04.444
That's it.

01:28:04.478 --> 01:28:06.280
Quick sticks!

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:12.720
I'm glad you're back,
Miss Bamford.

01:28:12.752 --> 01:28:14.322
Ha! Me too.

01:28:14.354 --> 01:28:15.689
You got your eye fixed!

01:28:15.722 --> 01:28:20.594
Well, the operation was arranged
some 18 months ago.

01:28:20.627 --> 01:28:23.031
There's a very long
waiting list.

01:28:24.497 --> 01:28:26.000
So it wasn't my idea?

01:28:26.033 --> 01:28:28.769
Go on, girl.

01:28:28.801 --> 01:28:31.338
We've got some parents
to impress.

01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:33.875
Are you ready
with your presentation?

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:37.377
Funny you should ask.

01:28:37.411 --> 01:28:40.881
Ah.

01:28:40.913 --> 01:28:46.554
Parents and friends,
sit back and enjoy

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:52.793
as the students of 7B present
Life As An Alphabet.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.842
Hello.

01:29:19.485 --> 01:29:21.889
A is for 'Albany'.

01:29:21.921 --> 01:29:25.826
The town of Albany
was established in 1826.

01:29:25.859 --> 01:29:31.632
It has a population
of over 33,145,

01:29:31.664 --> 01:29:36.069
making it the state's
sixth largest population centre.

01:29:45.712 --> 01:29:47.715

..and I'm presenting
the letter H.

01:30:12.905 --> 01:30:15.842
Some people say 'haitch',

01:30:15.876 --> 01:30:18.145
but if you look it up
in the dictionary,

01:30:18.177 --> 01:30:21.614
you'll see there's no 'haitch'
in the letter 'aitch'.

01:30:53.279 --> 01:30:56.750
I was going to present
H for 'happiness'.

01:30:58.585 --> 01:31:02.923
You see, I worried my family
had forgotten how to be happy.

01:31:06.025 --> 01:31:10.530
Happiness seems to have
emigrated to another place

01:31:10.564 --> 01:31:12.666
and left no forwarding address.

01:31:12.698 --> 01:31:15.869
I thought I could bring it back,

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:19.840
but I realise it's not something
that you can give,

01:31:19.872 --> 01:31:21.741
like gel pens.

01:31:21.774 --> 01:31:23.076
Hmm.

01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:25.211
It's inside of people,

01:31:25.244 --> 01:31:28.748
and they need to find it
and grow it themselves.

01:31:28.782 --> 01:31:31.051
And it takes time.

01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:35.054
But that doesn't mean I can't
keep trying to plant the seed.

01:31:35.087 --> 01:31:39.092
So, anyway, I came up with
something else for you.

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:42.563
Well, for my parents.

01:31:42.595 --> 01:31:45.131

01:34:35.034 --> 01:34:38.872
I'm going to get right onto
cleaning that up.

01:34:40.506 --> 01:34:45.311
Give me a H is for 'hug',
Candice Phee!

01:34:52.418 --> 01:34:53.720
Oh.

01:34:56.122 --> 01:34:57.924
Ooh!

01:34:59.158 --> 01:35:00.728
- Whoo!
- There she is!

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:05.298
- You were amazing!
- You were so good.

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:06.867
Rich Uncle Brian!

01:35:06.899 --> 01:35:08.469
Oh, you did such a beautiful
piece, sweetheart.

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:10.271
- Well done.
- Thank you!

01:35:14.207 --> 01:35:16.910
- Dinner tonight, Brian?
- Yes! I'll cook.

01:35:16.943 --> 01:35:18.378
Wonderful.

01:35:22.916 --> 01:35:24.384
I'm really sorry, everyone,

01:35:24.417 --> 01:35:27.988
but Miss Bamford said
no more speeches for today.

01:35:33.059 --> 01:35:36.230
It was really great.
You were awesome, Candice Phee.

01:35:39.332 --> 01:35:41.368
Whoo!

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:09.529
Ohh!

01:36:13.833 --> 01:36:15.935
Where is she, Candice?

01:36:15.969 --> 01:36:18.239
Dad showed me where to look.

01:36:20.472 --> 01:36:22.074
She's there, Mum.

01:36:22.108 --> 01:36:24.478
Sky is there.

01:36:26.279 --> 01:36:27.714
Mm-hm.

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:35.389
Phee national dish coming up!

01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:38.391
Sausages, eggs and chips!

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:40.194
Hmm?

01:36:40.226 --> 01:36:42.595
Man the pump!

01:37:25.204 --> 01:37:27.875
Mwah!

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.543
Look at this!

01:37:29.576 --> 01:37:31.944
Cheers, folks. Here's to it.
I mean, happy new year.

01:37:31.978 --> 01:37:34.213
- Happy new year! Whoo!
- It is the new year, but...

01:37:34.247 --> 01:37:37.384
<i>Rich Uncle Brian comes over
all the time now.</i>

01:37:37.417 --> 01:37:39.887
<i>He's invested
in Dad's new company,</i>

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.623
<i>and even Douglas Benson
is going to get a cut.</i>

01:37:42.655 --> 01:37:44.925
<i>Dad is making bad jokes again,</i>

01:37:44.957 --> 01:37:48.194
<i>and Mum isn't in her bedroom
nearly as much.</i>

01:37:48.228 --> 01:37:52.132
<i>Once I caught her looking
at a book about Nashville.</i>

01:37:52.164 --> 01:37:57.037
<i>Families are fragile, but mine
did not die when Sky did.</i>

01:37:57.069 --> 01:38:02.576
<i>Maybe it won't be happiness
all the time, but we'll be OK.</i>

01:38:09.404 --> 01:38:14.404
