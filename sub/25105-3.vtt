<i>Reverie, a virtual reality program</i>

00:03.120 --> 00:05.591
<i>where the impossible becomes possible.</i>

00:05.627 --> 00:08.628
<i>Anything you desire you can find here.</i>

00:08.663 --> 00:11.297
<i>But sometimes, people get lost.</i>

00:11.332 --> 00:13.800
<i>Caught between fantasy and reality.</i>

00:13.835 --> 00:17.942
<i>That's where she comes in.
Her name is Mara Kint.</i>

00:17.978 --> 00:21.907
<i>Her job, find the lost ones
and bring them home.</i>

00:21.942 --> 00:24.576
<i>And maybe by saving them,</i>

00:24.611 --> 00:27.656
<i>she just might find a way
to save herself.</i>

<i>Previously on "Reverie"...</i>

00:38.791 --> 00:40.958
But why are you so
concerned about her, Charlie?

00:40.993 --> 00:42.760
She's running around
in other people's brains,

00:42.795 --> 00:45.830
<i>using a technology we barely understand.</i>

00:45.865 --> 00:47.631
<i>Exitus!</i>

00:47.667 --> 00:49.833
Have you noticed anything unusual

00:49.868 --> 00:52.201
since the BCI was implanted?

00:52.236 --> 00:54.838
<i>Weird stuff, hallucinations?</i>

00:54.873 --> 00:57.941
We call it derealization.
It's a temporary effect.

00:57.976 --> 01:00.209
Put away anything
associated with the person,

01:00.244 --> 01:02.679
pictures, whatever,
and take one of these.

01:05.716 --> 01:07.148

Good-bye, have a good day.

01:36.613 --> 01:38.665
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:40.215 --> 01:43.182
Hi, you mind staying open a tick longer?

01:43.218 --> 01:45.184
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

01:45.220 --> 01:47.921
- Everybody, hands in the air!
- Get down on the floor!

01:47.956 --> 01:49.756
- On the ground, now!
- Get down, don't move.

01:49.791 --> 01:54.193
All of you, out from
behind the counter, now!

01:54.229 --> 01:57.195
Do I have your undivided attention?

01:57.231 --> 01:59.965
Good. In case anyone's confused,

02:00.001 --> 02:02.067
my colleagues and I are here to extract

02:02.102 --> 02:05.704
every last dollar
from this fine establishment.

02:05.740 --> 02:07.406
Go. Load it up, load it up.

02:07.441 --> 02:09.407
Hell yeah.

02:12.947 --> 02:15.713
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

02:15.749 --> 02:19.216
Believe me, the pleasure is all mine.

02:19.252 --> 02:22.921
Nate, are you in there?

02:22.956 --> 02:24.455
Nate.

02:24.490 --> 02:28.526
Nate, I'm coming in.

02:31.096 --> 02:33.897
Oh, my God. Nate.

02:33.933 --> 02:35.899
Nate, can you hear me?

02:36.497 --> 02:37.721
Nate!

02:43.475 --> 02:46.191
Why do you keep doing this?

03:02.744 --> 03:04.543
Hi, there.

03:07.197 --> 03:09.764
Would you sit with me?

03:20.510 --> 03:23.110
I know this isn't real.

03:23.145 --> 03:25.856
I mean, I don't even know what you are.

03:27.190 --> 03:29.484
You're not a ghost, are you?

03:29.919 --> 03:31.518
No, okay.

03:31.553 --> 03:34.688
Forget I even said that,
because that would be weird.

03:34.724 --> 03:38.035
As if this isn't
already weird enough, but...

03:40.328 --> 03:43.329
My God, is it good to see you again.

03:44.599 --> 03:48.835
You smiled.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.905
Can I give you a hug?

03:52.941 --> 03:55.541
Just a little one?

04:07.481 --> 04:11.485
No, no, oh.

04:12.225 --> 04:13.691
Oh, what are you doing?

04:13.726 --> 04:16.527
What are you doing?

04:23.235 --> 04:24.769
Charlie, what's up?

04:24.804 --> 04:26.771
Mr. Hallo was fired from his job,

04:26.806 --> 04:29.439
is severely in debt,
and now he and my client

04:29.475 --> 04:31.174
are in danger of losing their home.

04:31.209 --> 04:34.510
All as a direct result
of this time spent in Reverie.

04:34.546 --> 04:36.046
- Which is why...
- Mr. Baez...

04:36.081 --> 04:38.214
Which is why this morning,
we're filing suit

04:38.249 --> 04:40.472
against Onira-Tech for damages.

04:42.154 --> 04:44.559
Your husband's name is Nate?

04:45.256 --> 04:47.222
How long has this been going on?

04:47.257 --> 04:48.691
Three months.

04:48.726 --> 04:50.793
That's when he started using Reverie.

04:50.828 --> 04:53.595
He's completely disappeared from my life.

04:53.630 --> 04:55.698
I am so sorry you're going through this.

04:55.733 --> 04:57.299
We're all very sorry, Mrs. Hallo.

04:57.334 --> 04:59.702
But spending time in Reverie
was your husband's choice.

04:59.737 --> 05:02.828
No, this wasn't a choice.

05:03.787 --> 05:07.040
We're having a baby
in a few months, and uh...

05:07.749 --> 05:10.044
I don't even know
if he's going to be there.

05:10.418 --> 05:13.815
The Nate I married would
never do something like that.

05:13.850 --> 05:16.967
He couldn't. You don't know him, but...

05:17.926 --> 05:20.178
he's always been there for me.

05:21.012 --> 05:22.789
When my mother was dying,

05:22.825 --> 05:25.558
he slept every night
in the hospital for a month.

05:25.594 --> 05:28.061
Now, he can't even talk to me.

05:28.097 --> 05:29.996
Something's wrong.

05:30.032 --> 05:33.733
He's all that I have now,
I can't lose him.

05:34.484 --> 05:35.944
Please.

05:36.653 --> 05:38.570
I need him out of that program.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.485
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hallo.
It doesn't work that way.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.409
Can't you just turn it off?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.411
Nate can't come out unless he chooses to.

05:46.830 --> 05:49.248
What if that never happens?

05:49.666 --> 05:51.350
What am I supposed to do then?

05:51.385 --> 05:53.953
Okay, okay, I think we're done here.

05:56.089 --> 05:59.023
- Give me one day.
- Excuse me?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.159
Mrs. Hallo, I'm going to do
everything that I can

06:01.194 --> 06:02.389
to bring your husband back.

06:02.424 --> 06:05.997
But I really need you to trust me.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.479
You have one day.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.841
<i>Apertus.</i>

06:32.822 --> 06:34.889
Okay.

06:34.924 --> 06:37.157
All right, where are you, Nate?

06:37.193 --> 06:39.043
Well, that's definitely not him.

06:39.078 --> 06:40.731
Okay, come on, come on.

06:40.732 --> 06:43.178
Nobody goes into Reverie
to be a looky-loo.

06:43.768 --> 06:46.590
Badges and guns. Okay, now we're talking.

06:46.625 --> 06:50.405
The bank is surrounded,
come out with your hands up.

06:50.441 --> 06:53.675
- Uh, excuse me?
- Whoa, ma'am.

06:53.711 --> 06:55.577
You need to clear the area right now.

06:55.612 --> 06:57.379
I'm looking for Nate Hallo,
have you seen him?

07:00.617 --> 07:02.317
Go!

07:05.255 --> 07:08.088
- You!
- Hold your fire.

07:08.123 --> 07:12.860
- You're Nate Hallo.
- Civilian in the line of fire!

07:12.895 --> 07:15.663
Stop distracting me, I'm in
the middle of a robbery here.

07:15.698 --> 07:18.098
Yes, I know. I can see that.

07:18.133 --> 07:21.702
My name is Mara Kint.
I work for Omira-Tech.

07:23.405 --> 07:25.438
Nate, you're in trouble.
You have to leave.

07:25.474 --> 07:28.274
What? No, stop, stop.

07:30.211 --> 07:32.278
What?

07:32.313 --> 07:33.780
Come back! Get back here!

07:33.815 --> 07:36.249
Money!

07:41.121 --> 07:42.954
Wait, he was a bank robber?

07:42.990 --> 07:44.956
How did you know it was him
if he was wearing a mask?

07:44.992 --> 07:46.625
He was standing on a car, holding a gun,

07:46.660 --> 07:48.226
a bag of money, and taunting the police.

07:48.262 --> 07:50.262
If that's not a depressed
suburbanite's fantasy,

07:50.297 --> 07:52.865
- I don't know what is.
- Any idea why he's staying in?

07:52.900 --> 07:55.701
He flew away on a helicopter
before we could talk about it.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.468
What is that, anyway?

07:57.504 --> 08:00.772
Design images Alexis
asked me to put together.

08:00.807 --> 08:03.574
She has a presentation
to the board tomorrow.

08:03.610 --> 08:05.543
I bet she loves that.

08:05.578 --> 08:07.812
It's hard to describe
just how much she hates it.

08:07.847 --> 08:11.883
Like the heat of 10,000 suns
starts to get there, but...

08:11.918 --> 08:15.151
You know, you could try
red teaming Hallo.

08:15.186 --> 08:16.553
- Red what?
- Red teaming.

08:16.588 --> 08:18.422
It's a tech company thing.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.924
When you run into an obstacle
you can't overcome,

08:20.959 --> 08:23.159
you try a counter-intuitive approach.

08:23.194 --> 08:25.328
The opposite of what logic suggests.

08:25.363 --> 08:29.165
So, instead of me chasing him,

08:29.200 --> 08:31.166
I get him to come to me.

08:31.201 --> 08:33.402
Exactly.

08:34.605 --> 08:36.505
Oh, I wouldn't go in there.

08:36.541 --> 08:38.841
Alexis is preparing for tomorrow.

08:38.876 --> 08:40.842
And her mood is less than receptive.

08:40.878 --> 08:45.175
- How's it coming?
- Eh, there's still time.

08:46.009 --> 08:47.949
How's Mara doing with Hallo?

08:47.984 --> 08:50.618
Made contact, she's trying again.

08:50.654 --> 08:52.186
Hmm. What's her state of mind?

08:52.221 --> 08:53.688
She says it's good.

08:53.723 --> 08:55.757
I've been monitoring
her EEG, like you asked.

08:55.792 --> 08:58.025
Brainwave activity is well
within normal parameters.

08:58.061 --> 09:00.595
Though there is more volatility
than I'd like to see.

09:00.630 --> 09:03.364
Paul, is she in trouble or not?

09:03.399 --> 09:05.933
She's fine, as long as she takes her meds

09:05.968 --> 09:08.869
and stays away from imagery
that induces derealization.

09:08.904 --> 09:11.271
The effects she was experiencing...

09:11.306 --> 09:12.940
they're hallucinations, right?

09:12.975 --> 09:15.179
She said she was seeing
somebody from her past.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.711
She say who she saw?

09:17.746 --> 09:19.646
I didn't think it was my
business to ask, to be honest.

09:19.682 --> 09:21.753
Is there something I should know?

09:22.249 --> 09:23.755
Nothing at all.

09:33.928 --> 09:36.462
- Can you help me?
- Uh, maybe.

09:36.498 --> 09:38.864
- Hi, I'm Mara Kint.
- Casey Hathaway.

09:38.899 --> 09:41.199
You're the 2.0 lady. Awesome.

09:41.234 --> 09:42.534
So you're a designer.

09:42.569 --> 09:44.235
Yeah, I float between the teams.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.337
Decal there runs the wind team,
Megan's in charge of water,

09:46.373 --> 09:48.006
and we all work on greenery.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.741
Okay, so I need help
getting ready for a Reverie.

09:49.776 --> 09:51.576
Sure, anything I can do.

09:51.612 --> 09:53.578
I know that I can change
my look when I go in,

09:53.614 --> 09:55.746
and carry something small, like a gun.

09:55.781 --> 09:58.582
Well, the question is, can
I carry something much larger?

09:58.618 --> 10:01.417
Yeah, absolutely.
What did you have in mind?

10:03.122 --> 10:05.255
He's shooting, then he
takes off on a helicopter,

10:05.290 --> 10:06.590
throwing money like a madman.

10:06.626 --> 10:08.559
Is that what I think it is?

10:08.594 --> 10:11.428
Hey, boss, check out that armored truck.

10:11.463 --> 10:13.388
Oh, wow.

10:14.943 --> 10:17.333
Have a look at that.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.613
Take the front, I'll take the back.

10:48.497 --> 10:50.008
You again.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.178
Give me some space.

10:53.636 --> 10:56.222
I said give me some space. What...

11:00.743 --> 11:02.409
Okay, what do you want?

11:02.445 --> 11:05.378
- I'm here to help you.
- I don't need it, I'm fine.

11:05.413 --> 11:07.358
- Thanks.
- Okay, look.

11:08.183 --> 11:09.816
I understand.

11:09.851 --> 11:11.484
In here, you get to be who you want.

11:11.519 --> 11:14.087
You get to do what you want.
And that's very powerful,

11:14.122 --> 11:16.255
but you're paying for it
with your life, Nate.

11:16.291 --> 11:17.991
Your real life.

11:18.026 --> 11:20.293
You are spending
so much time in the Reverie

11:20.328 --> 11:22.327
that it's falling apart.

11:22.362 --> 11:24.830
Lady, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

11:24.865 --> 11:28.338
Oh, yes, you do. I spoke with your wife.

11:30.004 --> 11:31.837
She said something's wrong.

11:31.872 --> 11:34.339
She really needs you to come out.

11:34.374 --> 11:35.720
Annie...

11:37.877 --> 11:41.935
Annie's better off without me.

11:42.548 --> 11:44.479
This is my real life now.

11:44.951 --> 11:46.940
- No, Nate...
- We're done here.

11:51.124 --> 11:52.490
No, no, hey.

11:52.525 --> 11:53.992
Wait! Wait!

11:54.027 --> 11:56.058
You know what to do.

11:56.093 --> 11:58.284
Hey!

12:02.467 --> 12:05.268
What are you doing? Excuse me?

12:09.908 --> 12:11.941
Okay, come on, let me out of here.

12:11.976 --> 12:13.709
Okay?

12:13.745 --> 12:16.045
Stop! Stop!

12:16.080 --> 12:18.213
End of the road!

12:18.249 --> 12:20.549
Stop!

12:20.584 --> 12:21.984
<i>Exitus!</i>

12:59.839 --> 13:01.573
Hi, Annie.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.710
My lawyer said not to talk to you.

13:05.745 --> 13:08.045
Oh, I'm not here about the lawsuit.

13:08.081 --> 13:10.106
All I care about is Nate.

13:10.716 --> 13:12.349
Please.

13:12.817 --> 13:15.252
I could really use your help
to get him out.

13:17.390 --> 13:18.356
Okay.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.856
I think you were right.

13:19.891 --> 13:21.057
Something is wrong.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.693
Something is keeping him in there.

13:22.728 --> 13:24.828
Do you have any idea what that could be?

13:24.863 --> 13:27.296
I've asked myself that
question a million times.

13:27.684 --> 13:28.934
I can't figure it out.

13:28.970 --> 13:30.499
Well, were there money issues?

13:30.535 --> 13:33.836
Or maybe it had something
to do with your pregnancy?

13:33.871 --> 13:36.138
No, nothing like that.

13:36.173 --> 13:38.008
Nate couldn't wait to be a dad.

13:38.043 --> 13:40.209
Well, there has to be a reason.

13:40.678 --> 13:42.511
I don't know, I...

13:42.791 --> 13:44.155
For a while, I thought it might have

13:44.191 --> 13:46.257
something to do with the break-in, but...

13:46.293 --> 13:47.459
You had a break-in?

13:47.495 --> 13:50.462
Yeah, it was pretty awful.

13:50.498 --> 13:51.930
We were both home when it happened.

13:51.966 --> 13:53.131
Oh, my God.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.276
Someone broke in through a window.

13:55.703 --> 13:58.236
I was in the other room,
but Nate walked in on him.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.771
He had a knife.

13:59.807 --> 14:01.200
He didn't hurt us, thank God.

14:01.236 --> 14:04.118
But I couldn't sleep
for weeks afterwards.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.645
I can't even imagine.
How did Nate handle it?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.413
He was fine.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.616
I mean, we were both freaked
out the night it happened,

14:11.651 --> 14:13.818
but he got over it pretty quickly.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.120
Actually, he started telling me
a few weeks later

14:16.155 --> 14:17.454
I needed to move on.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.623
- Well, maybe he didn't.
- No.

14:19.658 --> 14:24.160
The break-in didn't do this.
Something else happened.

14:24.195 --> 14:25.962
That's what's so weird about all this.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.310
Nate's the guy other people lean on.

14:29.668 --> 14:32.563
Friends, family, work.

14:33.672 --> 14:36.505
He's always had everything under control.

14:36.541 --> 14:38.111
Until this.

14:38.676 --> 14:40.843
He would never leave me alone.

14:40.878 --> 14:43.616
Not unless something were really wrong.

14:48.719 --> 14:51.020
- Hey, Charlie.
<i>- Hey, what's up?</i>

14:51.055 --> 14:53.855
Okay, so, Nate and Annie
had a break-in four months ago.

14:53.890 --> 14:55.871
He walked in on the intruder.

14:56.451 --> 14:57.775
<i>Well, that's a scary situation.</i>

14:57.811 --> 14:59.136
<i>Think that's got something to do</i>

14:59.172 --> 15:00.361
<i>with why he's staying in Reverie?</i>

15:00.396 --> 15:02.329
Well, she doesn't, but
I just want to check it out.

15:02.365 --> 15:05.232
So, can you pull the case file
and see what's there?

15:05.268 --> 15:08.302
<i>Sure thing. Are you out of the office?</i>

15:08.337 --> 15:09.736
Yeah, just for an hour or so.

15:09.772 --> 15:11.018
<i>Heading home?</i>

15:11.907 --> 15:14.541
Uh, no. I'm going back to Onira-Tech

15:14.577 --> 15:16.710
to go in after Nate. Why?

15:16.745 --> 15:20.714
Oh, no reason.
I'll see you when you get in.

15:45.371 --> 15:48.740
Hey, guys, I need a can
of gasoline and a lighter.

15:48.775 --> 15:52.276
- Hell yeah!
- Hang on a minute, why?

15:52.312 --> 15:53.745
For his Reverie.

15:53.780 --> 15:56.114
And gasoline's going to do what, exactly?

15:56.149 --> 15:58.349
It's going to make him pay attention.

16:01.386 --> 16:03.186
My car!

16:03.222 --> 16:05.388
What the hell happened to my car?

16:05.424 --> 16:06.790
Hey!

16:06.826 --> 16:08.458
Do I have your attention?

16:08.494 --> 16:10.560
- What?
- How about now?

16:10.596 --> 16:12.029
They're mine, just give them back.

16:12.064 --> 16:14.732
- Make me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:14.767 --> 16:17.366
It's all right, it's okay,
I got it, I got it.

16:35.104 --> 16:37.439
Nowhere else to go.

16:37.688 --> 16:39.721
Give me back what's mine.

16:39.757 --> 16:41.222
Not until you talk to me.

16:41.258 --> 16:44.960
No, no more talking.

16:44.995 --> 16:47.095
You're just going to try
to get me to leave.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.398
- Why won't you?
- I'm not ready.

16:50.433 --> 16:52.432
But that's not you, Nate.

16:52.468 --> 16:54.935
I talked to Annie, she told me
about her mom dying,

16:54.971 --> 16:57.458
and how you were there
for her every single day.

16:57.940 --> 17:00.670
You're not the kind of guy
to just walk away.

17:00.977 --> 17:03.944
I understand that these Reveries

17:03.980 --> 17:06.092
are very hard to let go of.

17:07.215 --> 17:11.472
But you are destroying
your life by staying in.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.976
It has cost you your job.

17:15.656 --> 17:17.123
Your house, maybe.

17:17.159 --> 17:19.355
Don't let it cost you your marriage too.

17:20.361 --> 17:21.857
Your new family.

17:24.132 --> 17:25.569
You can leave.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.281
Right now, with me.

17:30.337 --> 17:31.993
Let's just leave.

17:43.516 --> 17:46.450
What's that? Is that you?

17:46.485 --> 17:48.485
No. I don't know.

17:48.521 --> 17:50.845
I've never heard that in here before.

17:51.758 --> 17:52.824
No.

17:52.859 --> 17:54.992
What is that?

18:07.106 --> 18:09.239
Hey, stop.

18:09.274 --> 18:11.942
What are you doing? Stop.

18:19.617 --> 18:21.006
Wait! Hey, wait!

18:21.041 --> 18:22.418
Stop!

18:23.454 --> 18:25.454
Nate!

18:29.146 --> 18:31.380
You should have seen his face.

18:31.415 --> 18:34.750
Paul, this thing that appeared.

18:34.785 --> 18:37.419
Nate didn't bring it
with him into his Reverie.

18:37.454 --> 18:39.755
He was terrified of it.

18:39.987 --> 18:42.098
Why would the program do that to him?

18:42.133 --> 18:43.789
The program's complicated.

18:43.824 --> 18:47.993
It reads clients on a chemical
and neurological level.

18:48.028 --> 18:51.629
- Sometimes, it unearths things.
- What things?

18:51.664 --> 18:54.999
Let's say you want to go
to Paris in your Reverie.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.868
We build that, and the
algorithm fills out the world.

18:58.162 --> 19:00.171
But the program takes it further.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.973
It watches your reactions.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.975
Figures out you don't just want Paris.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.611
You want Paris in May.
On a crisp night after a rain,

19:07.646 --> 19:10.880
with the scent of tulips
and Nutella in the air.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.849
So, you're telling me what?

19:12.884 --> 19:14.884
That Nate Hallo wanted to be attacked?

19:14.920 --> 19:18.322
Not wanted. Needed, maybe.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.825
For reasons he may not
be able to fully articulate.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.270
Uh...

19:24.195 --> 19:26.829
I can show you what I mean.

19:26.864 --> 19:29.565
But I'll have to take you
into one of my Reveries.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.567
If that's all right.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.503
Of course.

19:33.538 --> 19:36.472
I mean, if it's all right with you.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.452
I think I can trust you.

19:46.916 --> 19:49.417
These are all Reveries you designed.

19:49.453 --> 19:51.419
One of the perks of the job.

19:51.455 --> 19:53.221
Through here.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.861
This is my house from when I was a child.

20:00.896 --> 20:02.696
I built it as an experiment.

20:02.731 --> 20:06.700
To see if I could recreate an
environment purely from memory.

20:08.437 --> 20:10.504
Well, it looks pretty good to me.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.873
It is actually, I'm quite proud of it.

20:12.908 --> 20:17.710
But after it was done,
I kept coming back.

20:17.745 --> 20:19.712
I couldn't figure out why.

20:19.747 --> 20:21.381
You know, when I left the real place,

20:21.416 --> 20:23.449
I couldn't get out fast enough.

20:23.485 --> 20:25.084
Swore I'd never go back.

20:25.119 --> 20:26.852
How come?

20:26.888 --> 20:31.356
Most of my life, I've dealt
with fear and anxiety.

20:31.392 --> 20:34.059
Night terrors, panic attacks.

20:34.094 --> 20:36.094
Some days, I couldn't leave my room.

20:36.129 --> 20:37.362
All that started here.

20:37.398 --> 20:39.798
You don't seem like an anxious person.

20:39.833 --> 20:42.601
You get good at covering up.

20:42.636 --> 20:45.311
And lately, I've been treating it.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.397
With Reverie.

20:49.175 --> 20:50.733
This way.

21:04.190 --> 21:09.058
My parent's room,
my room, my sister's room.

21:11.096 --> 21:13.631
Then one visit, I found this.

21:16.717 --> 21:18.260
What is it?

21:18.803 --> 21:21.680
It's something the program added for me.

21:22.172 --> 21:25.774
It read me, and read my reactions.

21:25.809 --> 21:29.345
And manifested something
I would instinctively

21:29.380 --> 21:31.780
connect with this house.

21:31.815 --> 21:33.616
A door?

21:33.651 --> 21:35.817
Yeah, okay.

21:35.853 --> 21:38.364
Not a door.

21:39.222 --> 21:43.625
What's behind it?
What's behind the door, Paul?

21:46.129 --> 21:48.332
My father was a difficult man.

21:49.416 --> 21:52.032
Not a good provider, an alcoholic.

21:52.068 --> 21:54.835
Cruel and abusive when he drank.

21:54.871 --> 21:56.770
On the good nights, he'd pass out.

21:58.674 --> 22:01.303
On the bad ones...

22:01.710 --> 22:03.597
In here, I realized...

22:04.146 --> 22:06.313
that all my fear was fear of him.

22:06.348 --> 22:08.948
And I had tried things.

22:08.984 --> 22:11.818
Drugs, therapy. but nothing worked.

22:11.853 --> 22:13.819
Not until the program created this.

22:13.854 --> 22:16.221
A Reverie version of my father.

22:18.159 --> 22:20.326
And a safe place where I could face him.

22:23.831 --> 22:25.665
Paul...

22:37.711 --> 22:39.967
I learned he wasn't a monster.

22:40.547 --> 22:42.880
Just a deeply unhappy man.

22:42.916 --> 22:45.347
With a family he never really wanted.

22:47.687 --> 22:49.320
You can go.

23:02.768 --> 23:04.491
Shall we?

23:18.750 --> 23:20.716
Thank you for sharing that.

23:20.751 --> 23:23.051
No problem.

23:27.924 --> 23:30.892
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

23:33.430 --> 23:34.855
Paul.

23:35.432 --> 23:36.607
Yes?

23:37.100 --> 23:39.567
Those other doors in the Anteroom.

23:39.602 --> 23:40.986
The other Reveries.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.989
What do I use them for?

23:46.676 --> 23:48.410
Another time, perhaps.

23:52.790 --> 23:54.081
Got something for you.

23:54.116 --> 23:55.948
This is the man that broke
into Nate Hallo's home?

23:55.984 --> 23:57.149
Yeah, it turns out
it wasn't his first time,

23:57.185 --> 23:59.151
and it wasn't his last.

23:59.187 --> 24:02.121
He's been linked to four home
invasions in the last year.

24:02.156 --> 24:05.094
LAPD's been looking
for this guy for a long time.

24:05.827 --> 24:07.794
- And there is something else.
- What?

24:07.829 --> 24:11.130
I spoke to the detective
that was assigned to the case.

24:11.165 --> 24:13.665
- Nate Hallo never came in.
- What are you talking about?

24:13.701 --> 24:16.435
The detectives wanted him
to look at mug books

24:16.470 --> 24:18.260
so that they could identify this guy.

24:18.295 --> 24:19.413
He never showed.

24:19.448 --> 24:21.473
Well, that must have been a mistake.

24:21.509 --> 24:24.071
No, he stood up the police three times.

24:24.845 --> 24:26.945
It was no mistake. For whatever reason,

24:26.980 --> 24:28.346
he didn't want to identify him.

24:28.382 --> 24:30.448
A few weeks after the break in,

24:30.483 --> 24:32.983
Nate told his wife
that she needed to move on.

24:33.019 --> 24:35.486
What? A guy breaks into my home,

24:35.522 --> 24:38.956
while I'm there with my wife,
I'm not moving on from that.

24:38.991 --> 24:42.293
And this isn't the guy
that I saw in the Reverie.

24:42.328 --> 24:44.028
In the Reverie, he was much bigger.

24:44.063 --> 24:45.662
And he had all these scars
all over his body.
