WEBVTT

00:13.388 --> 00:15.598
I said, who do you work for?

00:17.934 --> 00:18.768
Be cool, Nik.

00:19.644 --> 00:21.396
Impulsivity never works for anyone.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.355
Move!

00:22.856 --> 00:24.774
Whoa there. You can't go all Liam Neeson.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.901
- You're gonna put Emma and you in danger.

00:27.485 --> 00:29.279
-  Come on. Hey, buddy.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.533
Best thing you can do...

00:35.535 --> 00:36.828
is just let me leave.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.373
- You'll never see me again.
- Hey, what are you doing?

00:40.957 --> 00:42.292
I'm getting dressed.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.254
Your hand's shaking 'cause you're nervous.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.048
You're nervous
because you know you're screwed.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.591
I'm the one with the gun.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.176
You're a pencil pusher.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.095
Do you know how to get rid of a dead body
without getting caught?

00:55.305 --> 00:58.725
Can you explain to your comrades
how I got in here and stole state secrets?

00:59.309 --> 01:02.854
All after you approved the trip
that got Dr. Novac kidnapped.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.147
Oh, Nicky.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.107
At best, you're fired, at worst...

01:07.567 --> 01:08.526
you're dead.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.865
-  Stop!

01:19.871 --> 01:21.206
Emma.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.374
What are you doing here?

01:23.374 --> 01:24.751
Saving you.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.294
What about the guard?

01:29.005 --> 01:30.924
- He feels a little run-down.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.471
Get in. Moldo po-po are on the way.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.728
I need your wallet and your gun.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.980
Shake your money loser, old man.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.149
Here we go.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.290
-  Mm-mm.
-  Mm.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.042
-  Mm.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.631
Tina just intercepted
Moldovan police transmissions.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.093
They found the guard,
no wallet, no weapon.

02:15.093 --> 02:18.304
They're gonna treat the whole incident
as a robbery gone wrong.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.640
Boro has no idea we have his to-do list.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.475
We'll know his next move soon enough.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.685
Bring it in, guys. Come on.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.769
- Let's go.
- Boom.

02:32.443 --> 02:35.488
- Hey, you sure you don't wanna partake?
- I'm good, thanks.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.368
All right, well,
maybe we, uh, grab a drink another time.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.956
I won't have to get punched in the face,
and you won't have to wear hooker shoes.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.792
Yeah, maybe. As friends.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.379
- The Drakkar Noir stays home.
-  Okay.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.756
And of course as friends, obviously.

02:53.756 --> 02:56.593
Ew. You think I wanna be
more than friends with you?

02:56.593 --> 02:57.886
You're-- You're ugly.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.430
Anyway, you did great tonight.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.599
Nik never stood a chance.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.734
So you are competent
at hiding your true self, Phony Stark.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.611
Tina has no idea you're a nerd boy.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.529
You know,
unless she looks at you for too long.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.115
Yeah, but I might've
looked at her too long.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.619
Her eyes are like the tractor beam
from <i>Star Wars</i>,

03:22.619 --> 03:24.162
just pulls me in.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.791
<i>She's there, isn't she?</i>

03:30.126 --> 03:31.211
<i>All right, next move.</i>

03:31.211 --> 03:34.255
Tell her you're getting a late bite
and invite her to go along.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.007
If she goes, that's a good sign,

03:36.007 --> 03:37.634
<i>and if not, no harm, no foul.</i>

03:41.304 --> 03:43.014
<i>Don't you wuss out on me.</i>

03:45.600 --> 03:46.935
-  Hey.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.063
Mom texted. She wants us
to come over ASAP. Didn't say why.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.606
Okay.

03:52.732 --> 03:56.819
You should not have unilaterally
disconnected the comms.

03:56.819 --> 04:00.156
You put yourself
and the entire team in danger.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.950
Okay, I... I guess, but

04:03.368 --> 04:07.622
I couldn't exactly do what I had to do
with an audience that included my dad.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.415
It's kind of gross.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.584
Very much so.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.838
And I shouldn't have rushed up
to the dormitory like that.

04:16.714 --> 04:20.009
Protocol calls for Roo and Aldon
to first secure the perimeter,

04:20.009 --> 04:21.052
and then I move in.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.972
If we continue working together like this...

04:25.890 --> 04:28.142
I have to get it through my head that, uh,

04:28.810 --> 04:32.522
you're not anymore the little girl
that I always see in front of me.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.024
You're now a really fantastic operative.

04:35.024 --> 04:39.070
I mean, you had a gun to your head today,
and you walked out alive.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.239
I'm so proud of you,

04:42.949 --> 04:44.784
and you should be proud of yourself.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.958
Then why do I feel so bad?

05:00.091 --> 05:02.135
Don't give Carter a gift.

05:03.219 --> 05:07.348
Because if you give him a gift
for no reason, it screams of infidelity.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.183
And if you smell from cologne,

05:09.183 --> 05:11.227
then just come up with an excuse,

05:11.728 --> 05:14.522
like there's some crazy guy
in the office that is a hugger.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.900
Always smelling like a fresh shower
is more suspicious,

05:17.900 --> 05:20.403
and so is leaving the room
answering your texts.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.657
And never feel bad... about doing your job.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.909
Plus...

05:26.909 --> 05:28.661
...you didn't cheat on Carter.

05:28.661 --> 05:32.749
All the times I did whatever it took
to get the job done,

05:33.875 --> 05:36.002
but I never was unfaithful to your mother.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.963
- You said you never had an affair.
- I didn't.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.174
An affair is a connection of the heart.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.763
Your mother owned my heart
from the time we met.

05:48.264 --> 05:51.267
When I needed to, I did my job,

05:53.144 --> 05:55.855
and today, you did yours.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.150
The job destroyed you and Mom.

06:00.902 --> 06:04.405
But it's what I'm best at.
I love it like you loved it.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.284
But I saw what it did to you guys,
to all of us.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.919
I can't be with Carter and do this job.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.056
What the hell is this?

06:30.848 --> 06:32.183
This does not look good.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.159
It's not Valentine's Day.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.037
Hi, Mom.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.455
Hi, Tally.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.749
-  Ha!

06:57.333 --> 06:58.960
- Hi there, Emma.
-  Hi.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.213
- Hi.
<i>-</i> So this... this is for you.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.761
Carter, this is... this is way too nice
an instrument.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.388
That-- It's expensive.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.181
- What the hell is going on?
- Shh. Wait. Wait.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.267
I've been saving for it
since our first date

07:14.267 --> 07:18.229
when you told me it was your dream
to own a Raffaele Carmalini, so...

07:19.230 --> 07:20.606
- You remember that?
- Of course.

07:20.606 --> 07:26.446
I... remember everything
about the night that my life changed.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.574
I remember that you said
you never wanted a diamond,

07:30.158 --> 07:30.992
so...

07:33.786 --> 07:35.329
Oh shit.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.918
It's a violin string.

07:40.918 --> 07:41.961
Yeah.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.925
Uh, Emma Brunner, will you marry me?

07:57.602 --> 07:58.603
Yes.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.730
Yes! Yeah, good.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.148
I--

08:25.129 --> 08:28.633
Boy, we... we are really far out, aren't we?

08:34.013 --> 08:36.057
You know when you said you wanted
to show me the boat,

08:36.057 --> 08:38.768
I thought you meant the marina, not a--

08:38.768 --> 08:41.479
It's not a boat. It's a ship.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.941
Right, okay.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.236
Hey, what does somebody do
if you get stranded out here?

08:49.695 --> 08:50.613
Die.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.667
What were you thinking
when you were proposing to Emma

09:03.918 --> 09:05.294
without my blessing?

09:06.003 --> 09:08.881
Well, um, you know, sir,

09:08.881 --> 09:13.886
um, I guess I just always felt that was
kind of an old and outdated notion,

09:13.886 --> 09:18.266
treating women like chattel
to be kept or given away.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.561
So you're saying I'm old and outdated?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.230
No. No, not... not at all what I meant.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.942
I guess I just--
I... I wanted to be respectful to Emma.

09:29.527 --> 09:33.197
What if you would have asked me
and I would have said no?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.959
I love Emma... with all my heart...

09:47.336 --> 09:49.380
so, with all due respect, Mr. Brunner,

09:50.256 --> 09:52.508
I'd marry her
with or without your permission.

10:04.103 --> 10:04.937
Good answer.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.232
Now get me a beer.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.317
Yeah, you got it.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.584
What?

10:27.918 --> 10:29.086
You don't like lobster?

10:30.755 --> 10:33.257
Perhaps, you prefer
to have your dessert before dinner.

10:33.841 --> 10:34.800
We have arcimboldo,

10:35.760 --> 10:38.262
a fresh fruit aspic with edible primrose.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.639
I had it made special.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.142
Oh, speaking of flowers,

10:44.435 --> 10:46.020
did you notice the dog roses,

10:46.604 --> 10:48.522
the national flower
of your homeland of Moldova?

10:48.522 --> 10:51.651
Speaking of which,

10:52.485 --> 10:53.819
when can I go home?

10:55.404 --> 10:56.238
Oh.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.824
Make no mistake,

10:59.909 --> 11:00.826
you are home,

11:01.577 --> 11:04.747
for as long as it takes
for you to spin my proverbial straw

11:04.747 --> 11:06.123
into nuclear gold.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.459
So where are we?

11:10.419 --> 11:11.253
Okay.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.425
The cesium waste you obtained will work,

11:17.009 --> 11:20.513
but its nuclear capacity
has been significantly diminished.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.933
So to revive those components,

11:23.933 --> 11:27.061
a small controlled nuclear reaction
is necessary--

11:27.061 --> 11:28.479
Tell me what you need.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.190
An MNR.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.528
A miniature nuclear reactor.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.445
Fine.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.907
- I'll get you one.
- No, no. You don't understand.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.535
It's not something
you just find on the street.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.664
I found you on the street.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.417
You worry about the science.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.502
Let me worry about
getting you what you need.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.507
There's a seven-figure painting
in your room.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.760
I know people
who are very good at acquiring things

11:59.760 --> 12:01.721
when... the price is right.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.408
Emma's gonna have
the most attention on her,

12:22.408 --> 12:24.702
but everyone has got to have
their role down pat.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.662
Working true names helps.

12:26.662 --> 12:29.498
Aldon C. Reese
will just spread his charisma everywhere.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.041
And HPV.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.420
-  That was never confirmed.
- Oh sweet.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.464
<i>Ocean's 8</i> in the house.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.008
I am finally wearing something cool.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.471
Come on.
Disguises knows I can't wear these.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.600
Sir? Are you sure I should be on this op?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.686
I've never done anything like this before.
I don't wanna mess it up.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.271
She should definitely be there, right?

12:53.189 --> 12:54.774
You're gonna be fine, Tina.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.027
The more of us we have,
the better we can sell Emma's cover.

12:58.027 --> 12:58.986
And let's not forget,

12:58.986 --> 13:02.990
we're dealing with people
that can smell the bullshit a mile away.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.659
They even caught me in lies before.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.455
- Mom?
- Oh no, let your work friends eat first.

13:09.455 --> 13:13.876
But set aside some for Oscar and his brood
for when Romi's feeling a bit better.

13:13.876 --> 13:14.877
Okay.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.171
Why bother? No crunchies.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.173
Come on.

13:19.173 --> 13:22.259
It's so nice to finally meet
some of Emma's coworkers.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.677
I'm her supervisor.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.180
She's a solid B-plus.

13:26.180 --> 13:30.100
Still looking for that second gear
we know is in there somewhere.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.397
- So good to put a face to you, Carter.
- Yeah?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.816
Everyone at work's been wondering

13:36.816 --> 13:39.151
about the kind of man
that could take Emma off the market.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.487
Yeah, that's...
That's quite a grip you got there.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.614
You can tell a lot about a man
from his handshake.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.242
- Yeah, I can tell you love handshakes.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.579
Emma, the more your fiancé
talks to our people,

13:50.579 --> 13:52.248
the greater the chance we get caught.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.916
Yeah, I'm already on it.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.335
Is that gonna be the extent
of our conversation today?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.546
- You giving me orders?
- Meaning?

13:58.546 --> 14:02.299
Meaning you haven't said more than
a few words to me since the proposal.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.134
Well, what's the point?

14:04.718 --> 14:07.429
I mean, I do the talking,
you pretend like you're listening,

14:07.429 --> 14:09.223
then you're going off
doing something stupid<i>,</i>

14:09.223 --> 14:11.934
like saying yes to a guy
with a fiddle and a string ring.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.519
I mean, what were you thinking?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.813
I'm thinking I'm done
with this conversation.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.277
Sorry, I'm gonna steal away
the groom.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.987
Can you believe it?

14:23.571 --> 14:25.406
Our baby's getting married.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.200
There's a ton of things
I can't believe about this engagement.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.494
Oh, come on. I've had a rough few days.

14:30.494 --> 14:33.038
This engagement is the only thing
that's made me happy.

14:33.747 --> 14:34.832
What's so rough?

14:34.832 --> 14:37.293
I quit my job.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.210
Oh.

14:38.210 --> 14:42.006
And I got into HR to help people
when they get pregnant or injured,

14:42.006 --> 14:44.884
not to convince them to accept
crap severance packages.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.303
Sweetheart, why don't you work for me?

14:48.095 --> 14:49.096
What?

14:52.474 --> 14:53.309
My bad.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.689
- I can't. That's crazy.
- Barry and I, we're always traveling.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.858
We need someone
to keep up with the inventory,

15:00.858 --> 15:02.318
to take care of the phones.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.194
Someone that we can trust.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.280
But you're retiring soon, right?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.033
Well, that would take a year
to unwind the company.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.119
In the meantime,
Barry needs someone to keep the books.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.038
Well, I am kind of over HR,

15:14.705 --> 15:16.790
and I did sales after college.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.793
It won't get weird?

15:20.377 --> 15:21.211
We're never there.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.422
Try part-time, please.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.924
I really need you there.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.637
Okay, why not?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.597
If it's okay with Barry.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.726
A-okay.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.728
There you have it.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.771
Great.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.481
<i>Grazie, grazie!</i>

15:40.481 --> 15:41.941
I'm gonna go tell Donnie.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.067
- Oh yeah.
- Yes.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.154
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

15:47.154 --> 15:48.822
It was a great idea.

15:48.822 --> 15:52.326
How am I supposed to provide strategic
support with Tally ten feet away from me?

15:52.326 --> 15:53.827
How am I supposed to do my job?

15:53.827 --> 15:56.830
Well, when she's at Merry Fitness,
you work out of HQ.

15:56.830 --> 16:00.626
But the best thing about it is,
every minute she's working for us,

16:00.626 --> 16:02.586
it's one minute away from Don--

16:02.586 --> 16:03.671
Luke!

16:04.254 --> 16:05.381
My man!

16:05.381 --> 16:07.675
Donnie, my wife's boyfriend.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.759
Mm-hm.

16:08.759 --> 16:13.472
Like the end of <i>Back to the Future II</i>,
all of this to be continued.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.642
- Tally told me the news,

16:16.642 --> 16:20.187
and I just wanna say,
I know what you're doing.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.690
I hired a top employee.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.275
I mean, I'm so excited about this.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.319
I'm sure you are. That's not what I meant.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.863
I know you're trying to win her back,
and it's not gonna work.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.367
Actually, it's already working.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.292
Mm-hm. Mm.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.504
- I'm so glad you said yes.
- Of course I did.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.506
- It's gonna be great.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.258
- It's the right decision.
- Yeah, okay.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.387
-  What?
- It's "be with me, my darling" in Swahili.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.304
Just go with it.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.557
Okay. Whoa, what are you--
What are you doing?

16:57.141 --> 16:58.559
Everybody's right there.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.977
- What is--
- Right there, I know.

17:00.894 --> 17:01.979
- It's dangerous.
- Yeah.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.148
- It's kind of exciting.
- Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.232
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.985
They've been working together for years.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.320
Oh, so you're a gym equipment salesman?

17:10.320 --> 17:12.823
- Mm-hm.
- See if you practice what you preach.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.826
Oh! That's very impressive.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.579
I practice what I preacher curls.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.499
It's hot in here. Are you hot?

17:22.499 --> 17:24.168
- I--
- The thermostat must not be working.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.795
-  No, it's working--
- I have a question about ellipticals.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.673
-  Oh, he's the man.
- Oh great.

17:29.673 --> 17:30.758
Will you excuse us?

17:30.758 --> 17:32.509
-  Sure, no problem.
- Oh, thank you.

17:32.509 --> 17:33.427
All right.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.308
Why are you wearing
this Garanimals-ass shirt?

17:39.308 --> 17:42.102
I specifically told you
not to look or act like you.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.146
This is Matter-Homme,

17:44.146 --> 17:47.608
a French-Canadian superhero who can bend
the laws of physics to his will.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.942
Number one law of physics:

17:48.942 --> 17:51.445
no one who quotes
laws of physics gets laid.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.408
There. I just airdropped you
recon on Tina.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.286
Online purchases,
Spotify playlists, Netflix history.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.247
It turns out
she has a nostalgia erection for the '70s.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.042
Sucks for you
because men back then were men.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.461
Steve McQueen, Paul Newman,

18:07.461 --> 18:08.962
and you ain't them.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.715
I don't know, we grabbed
late-night tacos the other day,

18:11.715 --> 18:13.759
and she just complimented my muscles.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.219
It's 'cause we're undercover.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.888
You think she's really interested
in your linguini arms?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.057
You've gotta recruit her
like a foreign asset.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.433
Step one, spot.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.685
You spotted a woman
who caused blood flow to your down low.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.938
Great. Two, assess for vulnerabilities.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.316
She talks to you, so she's clearly lame.
That's a vulnerability.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.568
Three, develop.
The best way to develop a relationship

18:31.568 --> 18:34.071
is to learn about everything she's into,
hence the file.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.365
Four, recruit.
Get her to go on a real date with you.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.574
And five, handle.

18:37.574 --> 18:40.285
You wanna handle her bing bongs,
and you want her to handle your nuggets.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.372
For that to happen, cover your shame
and do your homework.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.129
So Carter's parents.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.131
Oh, thank you.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.801
So tell me, how did
you two very special people meet, huh?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.720
Oh, well, I was working
at Morgan and May in New York.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.180
- Partner track by 30.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.015
And at our corporate retreat,

19:02.015 --> 19:04.768
there was a yoga session
taught by none other than--

19:04.768 --> 19:06.395
Me. It was me.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.938
I would have never guessed.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.107
Ford change my life.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.901
He taught me that
the rat race is for rats.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.321
And we're humans, part of the human race.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.323
And we should help our fellow man.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.617
- Yes.
- That's why we developed this.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.161
Coochie Coo.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.289
Unisex, pain-free bikini wax.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.416
- Take a sample.
- Okay.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.751
-  Now with CBD.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.047
Luke, don't be shy.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.966
We're family now.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.385
- We have a saying at Coochie Coo.
-  It's nice.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.303
Mm.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.221
There's nothing to lose but unwanted hair.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.433
And your dignity.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.644
-  Watch this guy.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.729
He's a pistol.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.650
What is it with their names anyway?

19:53.650 --> 19:55.152
Ford? Carter?

19:55.152 --> 19:57.821
Weren't they some of the worst presidents
we've ever had?

19:57.821 --> 20:01.867
Not to mention the Perlmutter men.
I mean, they're lady-killers.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.995
They kill the ambition
of smart and talented women.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.330
That's so unfair.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.956
I mean, look at his wife.

20:07.956 --> 20:10.375
I mean, she started out
as a Wall Street mogul,

20:10.375 --> 20:13.587
and then she ended up
as a crack-wax woman.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.130
You know, where they wax down below?

20:15.130 --> 20:16.924
I don't want that for you.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.675
I don't want your future
to be controlled by--

20:18.675 --> 20:20.510
By anyone but you?

20:21.345 --> 20:22.262
Thank you.

20:22.846 --> 20:23.931
He doesn't seem to understand

20:23.931 --> 20:26.058
that I can make my own decisions
about my own life.

20:27.851 --> 20:32.606
I've been telling her for years
that Carter is the wrong guy.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.983
We had a wonderful conversation
on the airplane.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.361
We communicated,
just like you recommended.

20:37.361 --> 20:41.448
She even said to me
that she preferred the CIA over Carter.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.201
- That--
- An hour later, they were engaged.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.994
I mean, this is insanity.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.540
Emma, it's a hard choice.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.293
Work over love.
Do you feel split?

20:53.961 --> 20:55.796
The CIA version of you

20:55.796 --> 20:57.631
and the version
the rest of the world sees?

20:57.631 --> 21:01.176
Did CIA Emma speak the truth about Carter,

21:01.677 --> 21:03.679
but once you were inside
your parents' house,

21:03.679 --> 21:06.431
back into the role of perfect daughter,

21:06.431 --> 21:08.767
you did what everyone expected
you would do.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.644
You said yes.

21:10.644 --> 21:14.648
'Cause you don't want to hurt Carter.
You don't want to disappoint your mother.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.989
No. I'm in complete control of my life.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.116
I love Carter, and I realized I was wrong,

21:24.116 --> 21:26.660
and I am going to make this work.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.288
You can't. Look what happened
to your mother and to me.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.332
I'm not gonna prioritize work
over my marriage the way you did.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.625
A marriage that is doomed to fail.

21:33.625 --> 21:37.921
- No--
- Okay, guys, let's hit the pause button.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.924
We're doing these sessions
so you can work together more effectively,

21:40.924 --> 21:44.011
but you can't do that
if we can't communicate.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.182
But I have something that just might help.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.691
That's supposed to be us?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.776
Pretty good likenesses, right?

22:00.277 --> 22:03.363
Those are like
<i>Sesame Street</i>-quality Muppets.

22:03.363 --> 22:06.116
Mm-hm. Courtesy of the US taxpayer.

22:07.784 --> 22:10.203
Since the only thing
you both want to hear right now

22:10.203 --> 22:12.122
is the sound of your own voices,

22:12.122 --> 22:13.582
we're going to try this again.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.960
But you're going to speak
with each other's voices.

22:19.796 --> 22:22.132
Yeah, uh, I don't think
this is gonna be a good idea.

22:22.132 --> 22:25.802
My daddy is a fossil.
He knows nothing about anything.

22:25.802 --> 22:29.431
I mean, because he was born before 1992.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.142
So he should shut up
and let me ruin my life.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.311
You're playing a dangerous game, old man.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.688
That doesn't sound like Luke.

22:38.565 --> 22:39.691
I'm Luke Brunner.

22:39.691 --> 22:44.738
I ruined my own marriage,
but I'm the expert on everyone else's.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.573
I have muscles,

22:46.573 --> 22:49.117
so that means I know everything.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.786
And I'm from Austria,

22:50.786 --> 22:52.746
where life is hard
and everything costs a nickel.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.498
You know what costs more than a nickel?

22:54.498 --> 22:57.209
Gymnastics classes and orthodontists,

22:57.209 --> 22:59.378
and a wedding I know is a big mistake,

22:59.378 --> 23:00.754
but my Daddy has to pay for it anyway.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.298
The only thing I can't lift is my own ego

23:03.298 --> 23:04.800
'cause it's so big.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.677
I've been lying
to my parents my whole entire life,

23:07.677 --> 23:11.640
but I pretend to be an angel.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.101
You see the hostility, Dr. Pepper?

23:14.101 --> 23:16.311
-  Oh, I'm hostile?
- Brunners, please!

23:19.064 --> 23:20.649
Oh, looks like Dot needs you.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.526
-  Yeah, okay.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.992
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.293
Thanks for trying your best.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.462
Sorry I called you Dr. Pepper.

23:43.338 --> 23:46.842
The Army Corps of Engineers
has analyzed Dr. Novac's research

23:46.842 --> 23:49.469
and determined that
everything that Boro needs

23:49.469 --> 23:52.264
to turn his nuclear waste slurry
into a bomb

23:52.264 --> 23:53.432
is readily available.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.183
Save for one item, an MNR.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.478
Miniature nuclear reactor.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.815
Fortunately, MNRs
are rare and highly regulated,

24:01.815 --> 24:05.235
used by only a handful of private
industries and research institutions.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.361
Few years back,

24:06.361 --> 24:09.531
a medical glass manufacturer
in Duluth went bankrupt.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.950
They abandoned their processing plant

24:11.950 --> 24:14.161
and left the MNR in the basement.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.246
Local cops found it a few months later,

24:16.246 --> 24:18.665
upon discovering
that kids had snuck in there

24:18.665 --> 24:21.334
and were using it as backstop
for their stickball game.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.503
- Oh!
-  Fortunately, the NRC confiscated it

24:23.503 --> 24:25.005
before anyone got hurt.

24:25.005 --> 24:28.008
So... the MNR is bait.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.802
We lure Boro into meeting with us

24:30.802 --> 24:34.764
then we grab him
and hold onto him like an Alabama tick.

24:34.764 --> 24:37.934
Okay, great, but how are we gonna
get in contact with him,

24:37.934 --> 24:39.102
let alone meet him?

24:39.102 --> 24:40.770
He's been on high alert since Kazakhstan.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.522
He'll only meet with someone
he knows and trusts,

24:42.522 --> 24:44.733
and someone he thinks
could get their hands on an MNR.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.319
Then, of course,
it has to be someone we trust too.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.821
She's right.

24:55.368 --> 24:56.578
We need the Great Dane.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.163
Yes. Yes!

24:58.163 --> 25:00.165
I love the Dane.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.501
- Good idea.
- No, no way.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.835
- No, no, no.
-  Yes.

25:03.835 --> 25:04.961
Who's the Great Dane?

25:04.961 --> 25:08.256
He's the best at what he does,
and what he does is what we need.

25:08.256 --> 25:09.382
Also he's just a chill guy,

25:09.382 --> 25:12.219
very laissez-faire,
totally que será, será.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.929
All about the c'est la vie.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.723
He has cornered the market
on cool foreign phrases.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.100
No, no, no!

25:19.684 --> 25:20.852
You're gonna love him.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.104
I'll have our people
look into his whereabouts,

25:23.104 --> 25:25.732
but you all need to be prepared
to move fast on this.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.572
Hello. Welcome to Merry Fitness,

25:32.572 --> 25:35.158
where being in shape
never takes a holiday.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.036
You work here?

25:38.620 --> 25:40.997
I thought it was just
the Schnitzel King and his sidekick.

25:41.831 --> 25:42.666
I'm new.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.960
Anything I can help you with?

25:45.627 --> 25:48.713
What, you don't recognize
your biggest competitors?

25:50.507 --> 25:54.177
We're the co-owners and titular twins
of Twinning Formula Fitness Supply.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.346
Right, right. I've seen your commercials.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.558
You don't look like twins.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.144
Shawn's still on his fitness journey.
It's okay, buddy.

26:03.144 --> 26:07.816
Of course. I just meant,
well, I've never seen you in the ads.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.442
Shawn's a behind-the-scenes kind of guy.

26:09.442 --> 26:12.320
I'm the face of the outfit,
but he does the books.

26:12.320 --> 26:16.449
Which is how I know there's no way
that Merry Shitness is outselling us,

26:16.449 --> 26:18.660
and that those "awards" back there...

26:19.786 --> 26:20.787
are bogus.

26:20.787 --> 26:25.208
We're the exclusive distributor to all
Planet Fitness in the Eastern Seaboard.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.169
We eat, sleep, and breathe
Twinning Formula

26:28.169 --> 26:33.717
and still somehow lose all regional
sales awards to, uh, Merry Fitness.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.719
I don't think so.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.222
Those accoulements should be ours.

26:39.222 --> 26:41.683
- Those what?
- Accoulements.

26:41.683 --> 26:44.144
When you get credit
for doing a good job. Come on.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.187
Are you combining
"accolades" and "accoutrements"?

26:46.187 --> 26:48.398
Look, you're new,

26:48.940 --> 26:51.443
so you might not know what the guys
who own this place are up to.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.279
Show us your books.
We keep it our secret, huh?

26:54.279 --> 26:55.780
How about I show you the door...

26:57.782 --> 26:58.950
or I call the police?

27:00.785 --> 27:01.620
Let's go.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.752
You just made very powerful enemies
in the fitness supply industry.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.803
Hey now.
Come on, quit sulking over the Dane.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.473
Is he really that bad?

27:22.057 --> 27:24.726
-  Honestly, he is a solid guy.
-  Mm-hm.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.728
As solid as
a black-market middleman can be.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.440
He doesn't sell weapons
and always holds up his end of the deal.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.818
In the '90s, he smuggled
100,000 Beanie Babies into Russia

27:33.818 --> 27:36.196
in the hay bales of the Moscow circus.

27:36.196 --> 27:40.367
I heard he strapped waterproof bags
of microchips to migrating sea turtles

27:40.367 --> 27:42.702
to get them from Cancun to Halifax.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.828
Ever seen the <i>Mona Lisa</i>?

27:43.828 --> 27:45.288
- Yes.
- Nope.

27:45.288 --> 27:48.291
You haven't because it's hanging
in a sheikh's bedroom in Dubai,

27:48.875 --> 27:49.959
thanks to the GD.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.506
The son of a bitch shot my toe off.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.757
- Oh shit!

27:56.633 --> 27:58.760
Oh God. I'm eating.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.595
I'm gonna have nightmares.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.139
Wait.

28:05.767 --> 28:09.312
Does your stump... Does it have a toenail?

28:09.312 --> 28:12.107
The doctors call it spontaneous regrowth.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.359
My niece calls it monster foot.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.278
I sent a picture to Ripley's,
they chose "not,"

28:17.278 --> 28:19.489
said it looked like a buffalo cauliflower.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.408
Flip-flops are a pipe dream.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.410
There's nothing to hold 'em in place.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.537
They're just flop-flops.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.538
Well, sorry.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.332
Big mission overrules little piggy.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.896
Good news, we've located the Great Dane.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.775
Bad news, he's in a Turkish prison
under an assumed name,

28:55.775 --> 28:57.861
two years into a four-year stint.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.446
The State Department's
doing what they can<i>,</i>

28:59.446 --> 29:01.865
but the Turkish government
has no reason to do us any favors.

29:01.865 --> 29:05.368
Good. Got what he deserved.
Moving on to plan B.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.453
No plan B.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.704
He's our only option,

29:08.413 --> 29:09.706
so we have to break him out.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.834
Polat penitentiary.

29:13.877 --> 29:17.255
Intel tells us there's a visual head count
every morning at dawn.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.174
So once we extract the Great Dane,

29:19.174 --> 29:21.885
we need to meet with Boro
before the next count.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.845
If our pal is identified as missing,

29:23.845 --> 29:25.847
Europol will push his mug shot

29:25.847 --> 29:28.433
to every police force
on the continent within minutes.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.561
Fake name or not, the Great Dane
is very distinctive looking.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.729
It won't take Boro long

29:32.729 --> 29:36.357
to figure out that the guy selling him
an MNR is supposed to be incarcerated.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.151
He'll know it's a setup
then we're back to square one.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.779
The other problem is
we can't leave the cell empty.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.490
End of the day, guards collect
all the meal trays to prevent vermin.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.284
If a tray isn't pushed through the slot
in the bottom of the door<i>,</i>

29:46.284 --> 29:47.869
then the guards will enter, and then--

29:47.869 --> 29:49.579
They find out that our man is gone.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.080
Once again, the word goes out

29:51.080 --> 29:54.334
and Boro will figure it all out
that it's a setup.

29:54.334 --> 29:57.796
So someone has to stay in the cell
to push out the tray.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.550
Roo, Aldon, we need you at the meet.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.553
Closest you've come to Boro
is shooting at him from a helicopter

30:05.553 --> 30:07.430
from 100 feet up in Guyana.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.598
He doesn't know your faces,

30:08.598 --> 30:11.768
so you'll act as associates
of the Great Dane and provide backup.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.895
Luke, Emma, you know Boro best.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.064
You need to be there
in case things go sideways.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.441
You know how he thinks, how he'll react.

30:18.441 --> 30:21.945
Why don't you get Salazar?
He just did a prison job in Cameroon.

30:21.945 --> 30:22.862
On an op.

30:22.862 --> 30:27.158
So is Finelli, Jackson,
McMahon, Chang, Roland...

30:27.951 --> 30:29.661
We are stretched thin,

30:30.286 --> 30:31.871
and I need you on a plane ASAP.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.124
I'll do it.

30:35.959 --> 30:36.793
I'll go in.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.254
What?

30:40.880 --> 30:43.341
- Why not?
- Uncle Barry, it's not safe.

30:43.341 --> 30:47.136
You have a heart condition,
and you're ill-equipped to do the job.

30:51.474 --> 30:54.018
Wait, why can't Barry do it?

30:54.018 --> 30:57.564
I mean, he hung from that helicopter too,
saved you and Princess.

30:58.147 --> 31:00.900
His job now is basically
sitting in a room all day.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.194
I mean, that's what this is.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.195
I like it.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.031
Dane's savvy enough
to stay out of prison once we spring him,

31:07.031 --> 31:09.534
but he also knows
that if he's caught escaping,

31:09.534 --> 31:10.785
the punishment's death.

31:10.785 --> 31:13.121
He will only jump the wall
with someone he trusts,

31:13.121 --> 31:14.914
and he's worked with Barry before.

31:14.914 --> 31:17.333
- Director, I don't think that--
- It's settled.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.794
Barry goes to prison. Wheels up in 35.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.340
This is a bad idea.

31:29.637 --> 31:33.266
So trying to be a macho '70s guy for Tina?

31:33.766 --> 31:35.810
Well, that was the idea.

31:36.811 --> 31:39.063
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- Don't thank me.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.649
This goes wrong,
you're cell block prom queen.

31:47.530 --> 31:50.783
Hey, Aldon, I wanna talk to you
about the engagement party.

31:50.783 --> 31:53.703
The prolonged eye contact
and the inappropriate touching.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.289
I didn't go near Emma at the party.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.207
Not talking about Emma. Carter.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.209
I saw you staring him down,

32:00.209 --> 32:02.754
and your handshake
was five seconds too long.

32:03.379 --> 32:04.714
If you would've been a meerkat,

32:04.714 --> 32:06.591
you'd have pissed all over him
to show your dominance.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.343
And don't deny it.

32:08.343 --> 32:12.430
I did exactly the same thing
trying to win my wife back from Donatello.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.598
Ex-wife.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.602
Don't push me.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.355
Luke, I like Emma.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.106
She's smart, she's gutsy.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.192
But that's it. It's just "like."

32:25.234 --> 32:28.404
And if you believe I would get between
two people that are about to get married,

32:29.447 --> 32:31.282
it's good to know
you think so little of me.

32:43.002 --> 32:45.797
Well, the reactor's still secure.
It's all good.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.467
Excuse me.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.846
How is my employee of the month?

32:53.846 --> 32:54.973
<i>I'm good. I'm good.</i>

32:54.973 --> 32:56.432
It's been pretty quiet.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.852
Except, um,
the Twinning Formula guys came by.

32:59.852 --> 33:01.521
The guys from the TV commercial?

33:01.521 --> 33:04.190
Yeah, they were complaining
about your sales awards.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.275
<i>They wanted to see your books.</i>

33:06.818 --> 33:08.695
Oh, they're just jealous.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.947
I mean, wait until they find out

33:10.947 --> 33:13.282
all my new deals with Planet Fitness.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.368
We're selling a bunch
of Pilates machines to them.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.829
Matter of fact,
I'm prepping now for the meeting,

33:17.829 --> 33:20.039
so if you don't mind,
I'll call you back later.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.499
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

33:21.499 --> 33:22.417
<i>It's funny though.</i>

33:22.417 --> 33:27.588
Twinning Formula said they had
an exclusive contract with Planet Fitness.

33:27.588 --> 33:28.798
<i>Well...</i>

33:28.798 --> 33:30.675
...<i>it's not a done deal, believe me.</i>

33:30.675 --> 33:35.513
Remember, 90% of the sales
is all positive thinking, all right?

33:35.513 --> 33:36.723
I gotta go now.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.099
Bye.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.851
Okay, thanks. Bye.

33:40.727 --> 33:41.561
Bye.

33:46.774 --> 33:47.692
I'm sorry.

33:48.317 --> 33:51.195
Must be really weird for you
to listen to me lie to your mother.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.281
It's the job.

33:54.157 --> 33:54.991
Yeah.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.493
But it doesn't have to be your job.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.079
I mean, if you really want
to get married to Carter,

34:00.747 --> 34:03.416
you should think about maybe a desk job,

34:03.416 --> 34:06.169
or doing logistics or something like that.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.796
I'm telling you,
it'd be much better for both of you.

34:08.796 --> 34:12.050
So if you could go back
and do things differently, you would?

34:14.302 --> 34:15.678
Yeah, I don't believe that.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.014
<i>Minute out. Prepare for jump.</i>

34:22.060 --> 34:23.853
Barry, why are you still sitting there?

34:24.562 --> 34:27.774
- How could you let me agree to do this?
- Then why would you volunteer?

34:27.774 --> 34:31.069
Oh, little Miss NSA
turns Barry's junk into a zipper-ripper.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.153
Ooh, attaboy.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.655
Whenever you like somebody,
you start getting all nervous,

34:34.655 --> 34:35.990
and then you do stupid things.

34:35.990 --> 34:38.451
Easy, you don't want
your last words to Barry to be mean.

34:38.451 --> 34:41.287
- Last words?
- Uncle Barry, come here. Just...

34:44.916 --> 34:48.628
Look, if you really don't wanna
go do this, I can take your place.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.298
- Yeah?
- Please.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.966
It's okay. You're good.

34:55.551 --> 34:56.677
Go.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.387
No! Get me out of this!

34:58.387 --> 35:00.264
- Good old bait and switch.
- I didn't see that coming.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.599
- I did.
- Relax.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.684
Think of it like a BabyBjörn, huh?

35:03.684 --> 35:06.354
I mean, I carried Emma
around in it all the time

35:06.354 --> 35:07.897
and I only dropped her once.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.816
You seem to have dropped me a lot.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.443
-  Good.
- Good.

35:12.443 --> 35:13.528
- Just relax.
-  No!

35:13.528 --> 35:19.242
- Go! Showtime!
- No, no, no, no!

35:20.618 --> 35:21.744
Wow.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.454
Well, that was undignified.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.289
All right, comms in.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.751
Tina, uh, drop team's a go.
You got eyes on them.

35:28.751 --> 35:33.589
Copy that. They're descending
at 195 kilometers per hour, on target.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.133
How'd Barry seem?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.175
<i>Raring to go.</i>

35:36.175 --> 35:38.427
I'm just worried he won't fit
in the prison ductwork

35:38.427 --> 35:40.721
because of his giant balls.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.612
Harness off, comm in.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.489
Copy that, Tina?

35:58.489 --> 36:00.158
Puppy's in the pound.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.035
Sorry, I... I hope I'm not overstepping.

36:03.035 --> 36:06.038
I've heard you and Barry do that,
and I just wanted to try.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.415
<i>Pumpkin in a pie.</i>

36:08.207 --> 36:09.041
Okay.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.585
<i>Looking at blueprints.</i>

36:10.585 --> 36:13.254
<i>There should be a round vent
with a domed fan grate.</i>

36:20.344 --> 36:21.846
There's a drop of about eight feet,

36:21.846 --> 36:23.472
<i>then the shaft turns horizontal.</i>

36:24.390 --> 36:26.017
Remind me why you can't do this?

36:27.018 --> 36:30.730
Because your skinny, malnourished body
will squeeze through it like cookie dough.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.577
Be safe.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.130
<i>-</i> <i>You good?</i>
- Uh-huh.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.843
You've been out of the duct work
for about 20 yards.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.179
You should be coming up
on another short drop.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.101
That wasn't that short.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.563
<i>Hang in there.
Keep your eyes on the prize.</i>

37:12.563 --> 37:13.898
<i>Everything's gonna be all right.</i>

37:14.690 --> 37:15.900
You know it's not that bad

37:15.900 --> 37:18.903
when you think of it
as the <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.490
Congrats, you're there.

37:54.689 --> 37:55.731
Hey, GD.

37:55.731 --> 37:56.941
How you been?

37:58.859 --> 38:00.736
It is so good to see you.
You look fantastic.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.947
- Thank you.
- Right off the bat. Fit as a biscuit.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.156
- Thank you.
- Oh God.

38:04.156 --> 38:07.076
- Well, you look great too.
- Oh stop. Don't even do that to me.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.161
- I have put on some.
- Stand right here.

38:09.161 --> 38:10.621
Look at those shoulders.

38:10.621 --> 38:13.874
Yeah, well, I know. I've been working
a little bit on my upper.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.918
I was feeling
so bad about myself in prison

38:15.918 --> 38:18.629
that I just kind of fed that
with food, you know?

38:18.629 --> 38:21.549
They say no sugar and carbs, then what do
they serve you? Sugar and carbs.

38:21.549 --> 38:22.758
Is that a beacon?

38:22.758 --> 38:24.260
And an industrial bungee cord<i>,</i>

38:24.260 --> 38:27.471
and a hook, and very soon a plane.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.016
- Okay.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.935
All right. And expect a little yank, okay?

38:32.935 --> 38:36.439
A little yank. Got it.
Wait, what--

38:45.781 --> 38:47.241
So how are the new digs?

38:49.535 --> 38:50.369
Prison-y.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.998
Found the Dane's contraband under the bed.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.167
Anything we should requisition?

38:56.167 --> 39:00.880
<i>Just a few magazines
and a bottle of White Lotus by Liz DuVray.</i>

39:00.880 --> 39:04.342
- Hm.
- And a box of Reggie! bars.

39:04.925 --> 39:07.803
They haven't made these things since 1980.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.181
I guess the Dane really can get anything.

39:13.684 --> 39:14.560
Gotta go.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.562
<i>Don't screw it up, sweet cheeks.</i>

39:31.535 --> 39:33.120
<i>No issues with the tray?</i>

39:33.662 --> 39:34.497
Tina.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.207
Hey.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.792
I dropped us into a private channel

39:37.792 --> 39:40.252
so we don't have to hear
Luke and Emma go at it.

39:40.252 --> 39:43.172
I heard them screaming at each other
through Dr. Pepper's wall.

39:43.172 --> 39:47.551
Yeah, they got more issues
than <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.680
Well, if you need anything, I'm here.

39:52.765 --> 39:53.641
Well...

39:55.601 --> 39:57.061
I could use some company.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.979
Then I'm not going anywhere.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.404
Oh my God!

40:06.987 --> 40:08.906
- Hello.
- I thought you were Danish.

40:08.906 --> 40:09.824
I am, yeah.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.952
I went to boarding school in Andover.
I'm fluent in English, Danish,

40:12.952 --> 40:15.454
and 'cause it's in Andover, Massachusetts, Moron,

40:15.454 --> 40:17.581
'cause everyone
from Massachusetts is like,

40:17.581 --> 40:18.833
"Tom Brady must have a huge hog,"

40:18.833 --> 40:20.793
or however they sound.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.337
What's up, dude?

40:23.337 --> 40:25.673
You're the sweetest Danish in the world.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.341
Come on. You're nuts.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.427
I should dunk you in coffee.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.719
You're nuts. You're nuts.

40:30.719 --> 40:32.263
-  Hug this, creep.
- Oh!

40:32.263 --> 40:36.225
-  Oh god.
- God, that is... vile.

40:36.225 --> 40:39.019
I have not seen anything that bad
in a... in a long time,

40:39.019 --> 40:42.022
and I have been in a Turkish prison
for two years.

40:42.022 --> 40:45.025
- What happened to your toe?
- What happened to my toe?

40:45.025 --> 40:47.820
You shot it off on the Borneo job.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.280
- Right. Right.
- It was you.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.115
When my gun misfired.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.659
I don't like using guns.

40:53.659 --> 40:56.370
It's why I was handing her the gun.
Technically you shot your own toe off.

40:56.370 --> 40:58.122
And I feel horrible.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.708
Worse than someone
with nine toes and ten toenails?

41:00.708 --> 41:02.710
Roo, holster your four-shooter.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.129
Hey, Dane, we have an offer for you.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.465
We want you to sell something
to Boro Polonia.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.551
And in exchange, you'll stay free,

41:10.551 --> 41:12.636
and you get to see the son
you've never met before.

41:13.762 --> 41:14.597
What do you say?

41:15.431 --> 41:17.933
Wow.
It's the only time I got sloppy, ever.

41:17.933 --> 41:19.935
I was rushing home
'cause Gertrude was in labor.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.480
I got caught at the border
with fake passports and contraband.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.899
It was just, you know, amateur hour.

41:24.899 --> 41:28.944
But... being free to me would mean
meeting my son for the first time.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.070
- I am in.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.198
- Okay.
-  Yeah, baby.

41:32.198 --> 41:33.824
- That's the Dane.
-  You're the man.

41:44.877 --> 41:46.212
<i>Do you hate the beach,</i>

41:46.212 --> 41:50.090
<i>because instead of a hot body,
you've got a not body?</i>

41:50.758 --> 41:52.384
<i>Twinning Formula Fitness Supply</i>

41:52.384 --> 41:55.763
<i>outfits not only the finest hotels,
spas and resorts...</i>

42:16.700 --> 42:19.703
Hello. This is Tally Brunner
from Merry Fitness.

42:20.287 --> 42:25.000
Yes, I see your hotels purchased
26 of our machines last year,

42:25.000 --> 42:26.126
and I just, uh,

42:26.627 --> 42:29.046
I wanted to make sure
they were all working okay.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.756
<i>Oh, that is so sweet.</i>

42:30.756 --> 42:34.385
Well, uh, I'll have to reach out
to the branch managers individually,

42:34.385 --> 42:37.012
but our main office
hasn't heard any complaints.

42:37.721 --> 42:40.140
But I surely do appreciate the follow-up.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.601
And if you ever need to call again,

42:42.601 --> 42:44.562
you just ask for Tammy Parsons.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.688
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

42:45.688 --> 42:46.939
- Hm.
-<i>Bye now.</i>

42:51.527 --> 42:55.864
This is McKinnon. Is home office aware
that Officer Luke Brunner's ex-wife

42:55.864 --> 42:57.199
is employed at his cover?

42:58.450 --> 43:00.244
Yeah, well she is. She just called me.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.666
This could be a problem.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.795
Off-kilter CrossFit. This is Fiona.

43:21.348 --> 43:23.934
- I did a sweep. The place is clean.
- Belts and suspenders.

43:23.934 --> 43:25.603
Please. This is about Diana.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.022
Who's Diana?

43:28.022 --> 43:28.939
Um...

43:30.399 --> 43:32.443
A few years ago,
I was stationed in Greece<i>,</i>

43:32.443 --> 43:34.945
and I had a very passionate fling

43:34.945 --> 43:38.907
with a beautiful NIS officer named Diana,

43:39.825 --> 43:42.328
but, uh, we had to break it off.

43:42.328 --> 43:43.912
- Two-boink rule.
- Two-boink rule.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.165
What is the two-boink rule?

43:46.832 --> 43:48.250
Any CIA officer

43:48.250 --> 43:51.211
engaged in more than
two close or continued contacts

43:51.211 --> 43:52.504
with a foreign national

43:52.504 --> 43:54.214
has to report the relationship.

43:54.214 --> 43:56.550
I mean, it's...
it's like a lot of paperwork.

43:56.550 --> 43:58.135
And Diana was crushed.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.054
She became obsessed with me.
I don't blame her.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.889
A lot of women become obsessed with me.

44:01.889 --> 44:05.809
But I can tell you, this safe house
has Diana written all over it.

44:05.809 --> 44:07.936
Vase of dianthus flowers.

44:07.936 --> 44:10.648
There's a fridge full
of my favorite Greek beer.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.359
Dianthus flowers
are everywhere in the Mediterranean,

44:13.359 --> 44:16.278
and your favorite beer
happens to be the most popular in Greece.

44:16.278 --> 44:17.905
Uh, narcissism much?

44:17.905 --> 44:20.658
Then why is this safe house
directly across the street

44:20.658 --> 44:22.451
from the same flea-ridden motel

44:22.451 --> 44:24.870
where Diane and I
made sweaty Grecian love for 12 hours?

44:25.454 --> 44:26.664
Twelve hours?

44:26.664 --> 44:28.957
I thought you said
you were only allowed to do it twice.

44:30.834 --> 44:33.003
-  Can we just focus?

44:33.587 --> 44:36.590
We have a limited amount of time left
to complete this mission.

44:36.590 --> 44:39.093
If we screw up, then Boro stays at large,

44:39.093 --> 44:41.553
and Barry becomes our new prison pen pal.

44:41.553 --> 44:44.640
- So is the place clean or not?
- I already said it was.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.849
Well then, let's get to work.

44:48.769 --> 44:52.147
You make the call to Boro
and make the meeting as early as possible.

44:52.147 --> 44:54.817
Yeah, just gotta dip into my address book.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.235
You have a bad-guy address book?

44:56.235 --> 44:58.987
My clients... use a secure phone service

44:58.987 --> 45:01.490
that changes their number every three days

45:01.490 --> 45:04.034
based on an algorithm
that works off the date.

45:04.034 --> 45:07.079
Only me and a few very other
important people know said algorithm.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.497
I like math.

45:08.497 --> 45:10.249
That's great, but no way.

45:10.749 --> 45:12.459
If the secret of the algorithm gets out,

45:12.459 --> 45:14.837
then I'm out of a job,
and then I can't afford diapers.

45:14.837 --> 45:17.965
And you need them,
'cause you're a big stupid baby.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.426
So the code is entered, and now we wait.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.553
Hopefully not too long.

45:26.014 --> 45:27.433
Two-boink rule, huh?

45:27.433 --> 45:29.476
You know, in Denmark they give you four.

45:29.476 --> 45:30.519
-  Come on.
- Mm-hm.

45:30.519 --> 45:31.937
Scandinavians.

45:32.521 --> 45:36.024
Hey, could I maybe take this opportunity
to grab a shower

45:36.024 --> 45:37.901
and change into some civilian duds?

45:37.901 --> 45:39.737
I'm just, um, I reek of Turkish prison.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.113
- Hey, just focus, okay?
- Yep.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.699
- Oh hey, here we go. Hello?

45:44.366 --> 45:45.284
<i>Great Dane.</i>

45:46.034 --> 45:47.661
<i>Where have you been hiding, you wild man?</i>

45:48.912 --> 45:51.874
I am in Greece. Aloha.

45:51.874 --> 45:56.128
Anyway,
I have a, uh, miniature nuclear reactor

45:56.128 --> 45:57.671
<i>that I've heard you are looking for.</i>

45:57.671 --> 45:59.631
Always with your finger on the pulse.

46:00.299 --> 46:01.425
That's why I love you.

46:01.425 --> 46:02.843
<i>That's why everyone loves me.</i>

46:02.843 --> 46:04.762
Uh, it's unanimous across the board.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.055
I've never met one person
that doesn't love me.

46:07.055 --> 46:09.308
Anyway, I got your MNR.

46:09.308 --> 46:12.186
If you can meet me within the next
ten hours by the Turkish border,

46:12.186 --> 46:14.188
my going rate on this is five million.

46:14.188 --> 46:15.481
<i>That's more than fair.</i>

46:15.481 --> 46:17.858
I'll need to put a lot together
in a short window.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.359
<i>Say, 7:00 a.m.</i>

46:20.944 --> 46:23.030
That sounds-- That's perfect. Thank you.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.407
<i>I'll be in touch with a location
that works for me.</i>

46:25.991 --> 46:27.409
You always come through, GD.

46:28.076 --> 46:28.994
We'll speak soon.

46:36.919 --> 46:39.296
I know I'm supposed to say
<i>The Conversation</i>,

46:39.296 --> 46:42.216
but give me <i>Play Misty for Me</i>
any day of the week.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.551
<i>Oh my God,
Eastwood is so great in that movie.</i>

46:44.551 --> 46:46.678
<i>You are literally naming all my favorites.</i>

46:52.309 --> 46:55.270
You... You hear that scream?

46:55.270 --> 46:59.525
-  <i>Yeah, uh... you hanging in there?</i>

47:01.819 --> 47:02.653
Honest?

47:04.530 --> 47:08.075
I'm terrified... of tight spaces,

47:08.075 --> 47:10.202
damp spaces, dark spaces,

47:10.786 --> 47:11.912
locked spaces.

47:15.457 --> 47:16.625
I did this for you.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.670
Uh... For me?

47:20.337 --> 47:22.339
<i>You know,
as the newbie on the team,</i>

47:22.339 --> 47:25.759
I wanted to impress you
as your more senior operative.

47:26.677 --> 47:31.765
Barry... you didn't need to throw yourself
in prison to impress me.

47:31.765 --> 47:34.977
You're a top CIA handler
with a case record that I'd kill for.

47:35.686 --> 47:38.313
Not to mention smart, funny,

47:39.773 --> 47:40.607
sweet.

47:41.608 --> 47:42.693
<i>You're gonna be fine.</i>

47:42.693 --> 47:46.572
<i>Just</i>... <i>pretend I'm there with you, okay?</i>

47:46.572 --> 47:47.489
Okay.

47:49.908 --> 47:50.742
Tina?

47:53.579 --> 47:54.413
Thanks.

47:55.497 --> 47:58.125
Up and in.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.042
Shit.

48:07.926 --> 48:10.679
<i>Schatzel</i>, I don't want to get into
another argument with you,

48:10.679 --> 48:14.516
but that is just one of a million
future denied calls.

48:15.100 --> 48:17.686
One of a million lies
that you have to tell Carter.

48:19.438 --> 48:22.149
Can this wait till after we're done
transporting a nuclear device?

48:22.149 --> 48:25.402
Well, Dr. Pepper said
we should communicate,

48:25.402 --> 48:27.154
and I'm trying to communicate to you

48:27.154 --> 48:30.574
that I believe you're entering a marriage
that is totally based on deception.

48:30.574 --> 48:32.242
It's a big, big mistake.

48:32.242 --> 48:34.995
You're gonna regret it,
and Carter is gonna regret it.

48:35.495 --> 48:38.373
When Carter finds out the truth,
he will be devastated.

48:38.916 --> 48:42.252
You should have heard him
when he talked about you on the Tally-Ho.

48:43.462 --> 48:45.505
I mean, he loves you.

48:47.174 --> 48:50.093
- Why was Carter on the boat?
- It's not a boat. It's a ship.

48:50.802 --> 48:53.972
And we just went out on a... casual cruise,

48:53.972 --> 48:56.266
you know, to talk a bit,
get to know each other.

48:56.266 --> 49:00.020
And... I just asked him

49:00.020 --> 49:02.147
why he didn't ask me
for permission to marry you.

49:02.147 --> 49:03.148
What?

49:04.024 --> 49:05.609
Why would he have to ask?

49:05.609 --> 49:07.277
You don't own me.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.987
I'm not something you give away.

49:08.987 --> 49:10.656
That's exactly what Carter said.

49:10.656 --> 49:13.075
- Oh my God.
- You know, that makes sense to me.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.118
And I agree with both of you.

49:15.827 --> 49:17.704
And I found that he is a really good man,

49:18.830 --> 49:21.249
but he's just not the right man for you.

49:21.249 --> 49:23.335
Not with the kind of life that you live.

49:23.335 --> 49:24.670
That's not the point.

49:24.670 --> 49:27.381
Come to me if you wanna talk about this.

49:27.381 --> 49:28.757
Not that it's any of your business,

49:28.757 --> 49:32.010
but I don't know if I am gonna marry him,
or not marry him. I--

49:32.010 --> 49:34.429
I just don't know,
but can't I get a minute to think about it

49:34.429 --> 49:36.640
- without you telling me what to do?

49:45.774 --> 49:48.276
You know,
we really shouldn't be working together.

49:48.276 --> 49:50.445
We are totally fluffed.

49:52.406 --> 49:55.784
I want a complete rundown of all
the criminal activities in this area.

49:55.784 --> 49:59.162
Stolen-car rings,
joyride convictions, chop shops,

49:59.162 --> 50:01.331
anything that you can find, now.

50:01.331 --> 50:04.960
Tina, get in touch with DOD,
make them run an RDS sweep.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.170
<i>Any radiation could come from our reactor.</i>

50:07.170 --> 50:09.756
- Yes sir.
- Our MNR has uranium-237 in it.

50:09.756 --> 50:12.718
Home in on that signature,
and we can probably get pretty close.

50:12.718 --> 50:14.219
Guys, I've been thinking.

50:15.178 --> 50:17.764
- This could be Diana's work.

50:17.764 --> 50:20.600
We can't deliver a reactor to Boro
that we don't have,

50:20.600 --> 50:22.394
so we must postpone the meeting.

50:22.394 --> 50:25.230
Well I-- Boro's gonna be suspicious
of a last-minute change.

50:25.230 --> 50:26.314
I don't know what to tell him.

50:26.314 --> 50:29.317
Just say you were transporting
a bio agent for a client in Cyprus,

50:29.317 --> 50:31.778
but one of your guys got sick,
so you think there could be a leak.

50:31.778 --> 50:33.447
You're monitoring symptoms with a doctor,

50:33.447 --> 50:35.782
but you're waiting on a test
to see if you're contaminated<i>,</i>

50:35.782 --> 50:38.869
or if the symptoms you're experiencing
are just psychosomatic.

50:40.620 --> 50:41.788
Just buy us some time.

50:42.456 --> 50:43.749
A million future lies, huh?

50:43.749 --> 50:45.125
Think I'm gonna be okay.

50:49.838 --> 50:52.507
I was just following up
about your needs this quarter.

50:52.507 --> 50:54.760
And please let me know
if I have the right number.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.970
The one on your invoice
just rang and rang,

50:56.970 --> 50:59.598
so I just called the one
on your hotel's website.

50:59.598 --> 51:00.599
Thank you.

51:10.358 --> 51:11.193
Hello?

51:16.531 --> 51:17.365
Of course.

51:19.493 --> 51:20.702
I'll come right now.

51:27.876 --> 51:31.338
- He pushed the meet. Thirty minutes.
- That's it?

51:31.338 --> 51:33.548
He doesn't care that you could be
starting the next contagion?

51:33.548 --> 51:37.427
He said take two aspirin and get my pale
Dutch ass down there as fast as I could.

51:38.011 --> 51:41.014
Said he pulled a lot of favors
and dealt with a ton of logistics

51:41.014 --> 51:44.726
to set up the transfer of an MNR
over international borders,

51:44.726 --> 51:46.394
and he was actually quite rude about it.

51:46.394 --> 51:48.647
Maybe you should shoot his toe off.

51:48.647 --> 51:51.650
I don't know about this.
There's too many variables.

51:51.650 --> 51:54.111
By the time we find the reactor,
if we ever can find it,

51:54.111 --> 51:57.739
there's the early morning prison count,
and Barry's gonna be in deep shit.

51:57.739 --> 51:59.282
I'm gonna make the call here.

51:59.282 --> 52:01.618
I think we should pull the plug
on the whole thing

52:01.618 --> 52:02.828
and get Barry out of prison.

52:02.828 --> 52:04.287
Luke, no.

52:04.287 --> 52:08.583
There are over 900 prisoners in here,
and inspection is randomized every day.

52:08.583 --> 52:10.377
<i>Chances are they won't get to my cell</i>

52:10.377 --> 52:13.338
<i>by the time you find the reactor,
meet with Boro, and come get me.</i>

52:13.338 --> 52:15.423
I appreciate that, but enough is enough.

52:15.423 --> 52:18.510
You don't stop Boro,
that nuke could kill millions.

52:18.510 --> 52:21.179
The needs of many
outweigh the needs of the few.

52:21.179 --> 52:22.889
Finally you're talking like a man.

52:22.889 --> 52:26.226
That was Spock
from <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i>.

52:26.810 --> 52:28.103
<i>Hurry up and get me out of here.</i>

52:28.103 --> 52:32.232
This is more complicated than I imagined.
I'm getting a little queasy.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.317
Yeah. Yeah, you don't look so good.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.527
Here. It's over here.

52:36.444 --> 52:38.864
Just splash some water on your face
or something.

52:39.531 --> 52:40.657
Right there.

52:42.784 --> 52:44.911
We're not leaving Uncle Barry
in prison, right?

52:44.911 --> 52:46.079
Of course not.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.957
As far as we know,
his cell will be the first one inspected.

52:48.957 --> 52:50.625
We got to get Barry out of prison.

52:50.625 --> 52:52.169
No man-child left behind.

52:52.169 --> 52:55.046
But if Uncle Barry's out
and his cell is empty,

52:55.046 --> 52:57.883
word could get back to Boro
before we're done with him.

52:58.466 --> 53:01.553
We break our word with the Dane
and put the Dane back in prison.

53:02.554 --> 53:03.638
I just got a boner.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.558
Roo will be in charge
of swapping Dane for Barry

53:06.558 --> 53:08.059
while we're searching for the reactor.

53:08.059 --> 53:09.895
How will we meet with Boro
if we don't have the Dane?

53:09.895 --> 53:12.731
We pivot. You pose
as one of the Dane's consiglieres.

53:12.731 --> 53:13.940
A Copenhagen consigliere?

53:13.940 --> 53:15.609
90% of what we needed the Dane for

53:15.609 --> 53:17.444
was to set up the meet,
which has been done.

53:17.444 --> 53:20.530
So long as Boro shows and doesn't
catch wind of the Dane's escape,

53:20.530 --> 53:22.115
I think we can pull this off.

53:24.618 --> 53:26.536
- I'll have your back.
- It's the only choice we have.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.872
I can't wait to break the news to him.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.874
Break it off, Dane. We gotta talk.

53:30.874 --> 53:32.709
Dane?

53:35.295 --> 53:36.129
Dane!

53:44.930 --> 53:47.265
I really hate that goofy asshole.
