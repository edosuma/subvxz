WEBVTT

00:11.663 --> 00:15.406
I need you on the stand to
confirm your earlier testimony.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.494
You want someone to lie

00:16.538 --> 00:17.800
for you on the stand?

00:17.843 --> 00:19.062
You can get someone else.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.412
Not me. Your Honor.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.066
I work for the Catholic Church.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.415
So you're a priest?

00:24.459 --> 00:25.547
An assessor.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.201
My colleague Ben and I
are hired

00:27.244 --> 00:29.246
by the Church to investigate
unexplained phenomena.

00:29.290 --> 00:32.293
The Church has a backlog
of about 500,000 requests

00:32.336 --> 00:34.860
for exorcisms and, 
miracle appraisals.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.384
I didn't know that was a job.

00:36.427 --> 00:37.559
A night terror?

00:37.602 --> 00:39.082
Shadow figure was in my dream.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.562
Called himself "George."

00:42.999 --> 00:44.392
This guy Townsend,
you know him?

00:44.435 --> 00:47.090
I've seen him, in other guises.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.832
That man is a psychopath

00:49.875 --> 00:52.052
who feels less alone
when he gets others

00:52.095 --> 00:54.358
to do what he does. Don't you remember?

00:54.402 --> 00:57.579
Julia. Weepy little bitch.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.584
We got our next assignment.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.629
And it's not
demonic possession.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.936
What is it?
A miracle.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.111
Is she joining us?

01:08.155 --> 01:11.506
I mean, I could have a look.

01:15.466 --> 01:18.165
Blessed art thou
among women.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.429
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:21.472 --> 01:24.084
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

01:24.127 --> 01:27.130
now, and at the hour
of our death.

01:27.174 --> 01:31.265
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:31.308 --> 01:34.529
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

01:34.572 --> 01:38.185
now, and at the hour
of our death.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.577
Amen.

01:47.846 --> 01:52.155
Blessed art thou among women

01:52.199 --> 01:56.159
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.900
You know what I like
about sex?

01:57.943 --> 02:01.164
Holy Mary,

02:01.208 --> 02:02.513
- mother of God...
- That moment when you see in her eye

02:02.557 --> 02:05.168
- that she wants you....
- pray for us sinners...

02:05.212 --> 02:08.693
- Kristen wants you....
- now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.608
And when she bites you, my God.

02:10.651 --> 02:12.349
Hail Mary, full of...

02:12.393 --> 02:15.178
And screams,
like she's out of her mind.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.658
You can't tell me
that's from heaven.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.964
You don't say she
screams like a saint,

02:19.008 --> 02:21.228
you say she screams like
a frickin' demon.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.361
I'm sorry.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.233
Did that distract you?

02:26.276 --> 02:28.844
Why don't you make up
your own prayers?

02:28.887 --> 02:30.454
Why do you keep repeating
that same old crap

02:30.498 --> 02:33.240
over and over again?

02:33.283 --> 02:36.199
Hail Mary, full of grace...

02:36.243 --> 02:37.287
Who's on first?

02:37.331 --> 02:38.897
...the Lord is with thee.
Blessed...

02:38.941 --> 02:40.725
I'm asking you who's on first?

02:40.769 --> 02:42.901
- ... mother of God, pray for us sinners...
- That's the man's name.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.207
That's who's name?

02:44.251 --> 02:45.426
Yes.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.167
Well, then,
who's on first?

02:47.210 --> 02:48.603
Yes.

02:48.646 --> 02:49.604
Go ahead and tell me.

02:49.647 --> 02:50.605
That's it.

02:50.648 --> 02:51.780
That's who?

02:51.823 --> 02:52.868
Yes.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.220
So, how does this work
with a miracle?

02:57.264 --> 02:59.353
Well, we investigate
the medical evidence,

02:59.396 --> 03:02.399
and you, as our psychological
and medical advisor...

03:02.443 --> 03:04.227
I'm a medical advisor?

03:04.271 --> 03:07.230
Yeah, don't be too flattered.
I'm the tech advisor.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.276
Well, you have four years
of undergraduate training,

03:09.319 --> 03:10.842
so you win.And you're cheap.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.366
That's flattering.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.369
So you offer your opinion
as to whether this evidence

03:15.412 --> 03:17.893
is beyond our
scientific understanding.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.590
Is that her?

03:19.634 --> 03:21.853
Yeah. Naomi Clark. 18.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.291
Cardiac arrest in the middle
of a college soccer game.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.598
When did this happen?

03:27.642 --> 03:29.252
Three weeks ago.
She...

03:29.296 --> 03:31.733
No, no!

03:31.776 --> 03:35.127
No. No...

03:42.265 --> 03:44.485
God...

03:46.000 --> 03:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.679 --> 04:06.724
How long has she been dead?

04:07.638 --> 04:09.640
Almost three hours.

04:09.684 --> 04:12.600
My God.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.999
- Begin recording.
- I'm starting an incision

04:21.043 --> 04:22.653
at 8:36 p.m.

04:22.697 --> 04:26.570
Patient was an 18-year-old
African American female

04:26.614 --> 04:28.790
with no significant
past medical history.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.574
First incision will be
at the jaw line.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.533
There is no...

04:42.586 --> 04:44.284
Wow.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.678
It's not a miracle.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.332
I wish it were.
We could avoid a lawsuit.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.900
But I don't understand.

04:51.943 --> 04:55.033
Your hospital declared
Naomi dead at 5:33 p.m.

04:55.077 --> 04:58.341
Then, 177 minutes later,
she sat up in the morgue.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.430
Look, I know you're invested in
proving this is a miracle...

05:00.474 --> 05:02.867
No, actually, we're not....and I agreed

05:02.911 --> 05:05.043
to let the archdiocese
ask me a few questions,

05:05.087 --> 05:07.219
but medicine has limits
to its knowledge.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.352
You know, it's not all-knowing,
and we're not God.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.314
Physiologies
are different.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.577
Young people tend to bounce
back sooner than expected.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.753
So you're saying
it's because Naomi was young

05:18.796 --> 05:21.538
- that she was able to bounce back?
- No.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.235
I'm saying the patient
suffered from bouts

05:23.279 --> 05:25.368
of hyperinflation, and
that gave the appearance

05:25.412 --> 05:26.587
that she was
non-responsive.

05:26.630 --> 05:29.198
Hyperinflation? What is that?

05:29.241 --> 05:31.679
A condition in which
the lungs lack elasticity.

05:31.722 --> 05:34.508
The excess air from CPR
gets trapped in the lungs

05:34.551 --> 05:36.423
and keeps the patient
from breathing freely.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.163
So the patient had COPD.

05:38.207 --> 05:41.776
Are you with the Church?

05:41.819 --> 05:42.794
Yes.

05:42.820 --> 05:46.258
She's our psychological advisor.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.915
Look, these were
emergency circumstances.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.395
The patient was in
cardiac arrest,

05:52.439 --> 05:54.441
and the first responders
were inexperienced.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.965
They rushed the CPR
and didn't realize

05:57.008 --> 05:59.576
her alveoli would be
so inelastic.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.838
That's bull.

06:00.882 --> 06:03.188
So it's not hyperinflation?No.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.452
He's trying to blame us
to dodge a malpractice.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.845
He says you were overanxious
and kept administering CPR.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.543
'Cause she
was dying.

06:09.586 --> 06:10.718
We got our patient to the door.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.459
Rapid response takes over.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.417
So what
do you think happened?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.550
You don't want to know
what I think happened.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.552
Yes, I do.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.512
Look, I'm not religious.

06:22.556 --> 06:23.470
I don't believe
in all that stuff,

06:23.513 --> 06:24.906
but come on.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.429
That girl was dead
for three hours.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.822
I saw her dead.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.476
Lividity sets in
after an hour,

06:29.519 --> 06:31.042
brain death after 90 minutes.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.088
Do you think it was a miracle?

06:33.131 --> 06:34.394
I don't know.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.397
I don't like that word, but...

06:37.440 --> 06:39.224
something happened.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.923
You can call it a miracle,
you can call it just weird,

06:41.966 --> 06:43.620
but something happened.

06:44.839 --> 06:48.103
Do they have cameras
in the operating room?

06:48.146 --> 06:49.234
Why?

06:49.278 --> 06:51.889
Just to see what
life-saving precautions

06:51.933 --> 06:52.977
the hospital took.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.501
You mean the trauma bay.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.939
And, yeah, but they erase
that stuff after a week.

06:57.982 --> 07:00.158
So what are you thinking?

07:00.202 --> 07:02.465
I mean, I think
it's possible.

07:02.509 --> 07:06.513
It's happened before, COPD
patient reviving after coding.

07:06.556 --> 07:09.603
But after three hours?
That's just extreme.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.431
Did you ever work on
a malpractice case

07:11.474 --> 07:13.824
at the DA's office?Yeah. Once. Why?

07:13.868 --> 07:18.438
Aren't these surveillance
tapes considered evidence?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.747
Darryl.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.489
Kristen Bouchard.
I thought you were

07:26.533 --> 07:27.882
fired.I was.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.449
But I just can't stay
away from you.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.450
What you eating?

07:30.493 --> 07:32.495
Food.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.801
So what are you doing here?

07:33.844 --> 07:35.629
I heard that you're on
this malpractice lawsuit

07:35.672 --> 07:37.282
at Harbor Hospital.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.720
I need surveillance footage
from the hospital that night.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.286
Why would I do that?

07:41.330 --> 07:42.810
Because I can
feed you information

07:42.853 --> 07:44.072
on the hospital's defense.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.466
Kristen. Hey.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.511
Lewis.I'm rushing to court.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.599
Do you have a minute?Of course. Yeah.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.949
Let's talk, Darryl.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.604
Is your husband
still off climbing?

07:54.648 --> 07:57.520
Yes. Another
few weeks.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.305
What do you think about
coming back for a short stint?

08:00.349 --> 08:01.959
You want me to come back here?

08:02.003 --> 08:03.570
Yeah.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.268
It's just a bad time
to look for someone new.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.575
You could carry on the
cases you already started.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.709
Well, my only worry, Lewis,

08:12.753 --> 08:14.711
is that I need a little bit
more certainty

08:14.755 --> 08:16.234
than this job offers.

08:16.278 --> 08:19.542
And you have that
certainty in your new job?

08:19.586 --> 08:22.458
I do.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.417
Okay.

08:25.461 --> 08:28.072
What kind of certainty
are you looking for?

08:37.604 --> 08:40.693
We got the call.
You got it?

08:43.566 --> 08:45.612
So you got this
from one of the lawyers?

08:45.655 --> 08:47.701
Plaintiff's attorney.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.746
Okay.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.492
All right, give me a count.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.667
One, two,

08:57.711 --> 08:59.582
three, four, five, six...

08:59.626 --> 09:01.889
Are they rushing the CPR?

09:01.932 --> 09:05.109
No, it doesn't look like it.
Pretty textbook.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.589
BP's falling.

09:06.633 --> 09:07.634
Still no pulse.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.331
What is that?

09:09.374 --> 09:11.638
I don't know. Power surge?

09:11.681 --> 09:13.204
Pulse.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.600
Weird.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.775
What?

09:18.819 --> 09:21.735
There power surges...
Hold on.

09:21.778 --> 09:22.910
...11, 12...

09:25.303 --> 09:28.045
Did you see that?

09:28.089 --> 09:29.656
What?

09:29.699 --> 09:31.135
Hey...

09:31.179 --> 09:33.137
do it again.

09:36.924 --> 09:39.361
What-- What is that?

09:44.409 --> 09:46.629
I don't understand.

09:46.673 --> 09:50.764
It's... it's been faked.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.896
What do you mean?BEN: I-I mean,

09:52.940 --> 09:54.594
hasn't anyone else seen this?

09:54.637 --> 09:55.682
A lawyer,
but he didn't mention it.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.292
We almost played
through it ourselves.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.423
It was just a flash.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.122
This is a re-used
digital card.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.733
What we're looking at
is an artifact

10:03.777 --> 10:04.778
of an earlier
recording.

10:04.821 --> 10:05.866
You can find out?

10:05.909 --> 10:08.477
Yeah.
I'm going to.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.789
Too bizarre for you?

10:17.704 --> 10:19.706
You always seeing angels
in your videos?

10:21.403 --> 10:22.926
Ben's
probably right.

10:22.970 --> 10:26.626
It's just an artifact
of a digital recording.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.629
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.719
So... you believe in miracles?

10:32.762 --> 10:35.939
I do.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.289
Do you think I'm crazy?

10:38.333 --> 10:39.726
No, I don't.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.337
But... I just want
to understand.

10:42.380 --> 10:46.646
So... so you think that
if you just pray hard enough,

10:46.689 --> 10:49.300
God's gonna grant
you miracles?

10:49.344 --> 10:53.174
No, it's not like that.
It's, um...

10:53.217 --> 10:57.700
God has designs with...
within designs.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.834
And to us,
they are impenetrable.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.277
My youngest daughter, Laura,

11:09.320 --> 11:13.150
she, um... she was born
with a heart defect

11:13.194 --> 11:15.152
in her mitral valve.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.720
It's just a genetic screw-up.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.027
It's fate. You know,
the-the muscle formed one way

11:20.070 --> 11:21.724
and not another.

11:21.768 --> 11:26.729
But there's a 50-50 chance
that she'll die before she's 20.

11:26.773 --> 11:31.342
Just drop dead in the middle
of anything, really.

11:31.386 --> 11:35.564
Walking, running, sleeping.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.348
My God.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.568
I'm...

11:39.611 --> 11:41.570
I'm sorry.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.224
That's okay.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.749
Doctor wants to see
her in three weeks

11:46.793 --> 11:49.926
because the valve may develop
on its own, and it may regress

11:49.970 --> 11:52.537
and in three weeks
we're gonna find out

11:52.581 --> 11:53.713
which it is.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.412
It's weird, really.

11:57.455 --> 12:01.503
The future decided
in one hospital visit.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.635
Just a flip of the coin.

12:03.679 --> 12:06.900
Heads, the valve's developing,

12:06.943 --> 12:10.947
tails, it's regressing
and she'll...

12:10.991 --> 12:14.646
she'll be dead before
she can graduate college.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.301
And if I thought
that prayer

12:17.345 --> 12:20.217
would have any impact
on it at all, I mean,

12:20.261 --> 12:22.829
I would be on my knees
every single night.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.961
I wouldn't go out.
I would pray so much,

12:25.005 --> 12:26.876
I'd shame the saints.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.139
But that's not
how it works, is it?

12:29.183 --> 12:32.403
I mean, there are millions
of religious people praying,

12:32.447 --> 12:36.190
and they still die of
cancer or car accidents.

12:36.233 --> 12:41.282
And there are still bastards
who survive to 90.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.893
So I don't understand
the worth of prayer

12:43.937 --> 12:46.330
if it doesn't help.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.511
I don't know...

12:53.555 --> 12:57.820
I... but I'll pray

12:57.864 --> 12:59.213
for your daughter.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.693
I'll pray for Laura.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.829
Is she all right?

13:06.873 --> 13:09.658
She's great.

13:11.486 --> 13:12.966
She makes me laugh.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.187
I just don't understand

13:17.231 --> 13:19.842
how God could choose
winners and losers.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.757
He doesn't.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.586
But if there are miracles,
then some people get them,

13:24.629 --> 13:26.370
and some people
don't, right?

13:26.414 --> 13:28.024
I mean, isn't that the
problem with miracles?

13:28.068 --> 13:30.418
Not that they happen,
but that they happen

13:30.461 --> 13:32.899
to some people
and not to others.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.863
Do you want to drop out
of this assessment?

13:40.907 --> 13:43.735
I would understand if you did.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.783
No, I-I don't. I...

13:47.827 --> 13:49.829
I want to do this.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.835
But, um...

13:55.878 --> 13:59.664
the DA's office
did ask me to return.

13:59.708 --> 14:03.277
They're offering me a two-year
contract to work with them.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.933
And you want to go back?

14:06.976 --> 14:08.891
I can't turn down the money.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.026
Well, when do you have
to decide?

14:13.069 --> 14:15.332
Tomorrow.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.595
Okay.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.902
Well...

14:19.946 --> 14:22.644
let me see what I can do.

14:42.011 --> 14:42.925
What happened?

14:42.969 --> 14:44.100
Laura!

14:44.144 --> 14:45.101
- Laura, are you okay?
- Laura!

14:45.145 --> 14:46.233
Laura, are you okay?

14:46.276 --> 14:48.104
Mom, is she okay?
Do you need water?

14:48.148 --> 14:49.584
Are you all right?

14:49.627 --> 14:51.020
Yeah.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.543
Was your teacher
punching you again?

14:52.587 --> 14:55.111
Can I sleep with you, Mom?
It's wet.

14:57.113 --> 15:00.029
Shh...

15:03.424 --> 15:04.947
I didn't wet
my bed, Mom.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.994
Shh. It's okay.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.691
It's okay, just
go to sleep.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.650
I didn't.
It was a man.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.089
What man?

15:16.132 --> 15:17.873
He was scary.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.050
He had really big teeth
and red eyes,

15:21.094 --> 15:23.574
and, like, you know,
like a devil-person.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.669
And I couldn't move.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.194
He had a knife he was
holding to my hand.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.978
Cutting off my fingers.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.391
I mean, that's what
I don't understand.

15:57.434 --> 16:00.046
My daughter is seeing
the exact same things

16:00.089 --> 16:01.482
in her nightmares as I am.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.484
And you never told her
about the imagery

16:03.527 --> 16:05.486
from yournightmares?No. I would never.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.357
Kurt.

16:07.401 --> 16:10.447
I'm sorry.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.493
Second nature.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.279
How similar were
your nightmares?

16:16.323 --> 16:17.759
Both have a demonic creature.-

16:17.802 --> 16:20.588
With a knife.
Cutting off fingers.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.286
That's pretty generic.

16:23.330 --> 16:26.811
Could she be reacting
to the same imagery,

16:26.855 --> 16:28.988
like, a-a billboard
you've seen together,

16:29.031 --> 16:30.685
or a... a drawing?

16:30.728 --> 16:33.383
I mean, I-- No, 
not that I know of.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.995
Are you still working
with that new job,

16:36.038 --> 16:37.518
that demonic
possession thing?

16:37.561 --> 16:39.389
No. I mean, yes, I am,

16:39.433 --> 16:42.044
but now, um,
it's focused on miracles.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.612
You're looking into miracles?

16:44.655 --> 16:46.614
Medical singularities.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.311
I'm fascinated.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.357
No, you're not.
You're being dismissive.No.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.533
I did a cultural tour in Bali.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.404
Alternative cultures often use

16:54.448 --> 16:56.319
spiritual images
in their psychological work.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.539
It has a great
placebo effect.

16:58.582 --> 16:59.670
I should probably
head out.

16:59.714 --> 17:04.066
Kristen...
I have extra security now,

17:04.109 --> 17:05.328
to protect against theft.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.982
No notes.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.290
I think we should
start up again weekly.

17:12.335 --> 17:15.251
Let me think about it.

17:15.295 --> 17:19.429
So... what do you say,
Monsignor?

17:19.473 --> 17:21.387
She wants a
two-year commitment?

17:21.431 --> 17:24.130
She's being offered one
by her old job.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.608
And we don't want
to lose her.

17:25.653 --> 17:30.440
And how is this assessment
at Harbor Hospital going?

17:30.484 --> 17:31.833
The miracle?

17:31.876 --> 17:34.749
Well, that
is debatable.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.230
You know the priest,
Father Augustus?

17:37.273 --> 17:38.666
I do.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.625
I'm not sure God uses an
alcoholic for His miracles.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.932
He used Moses.

17:43.975 --> 17:47.718
You just like being
contentious, don't you?

17:49.546 --> 17:52.245
They call him the
"miracle priest" now.

17:52.288 --> 17:53.594
So you want this all
to go away?

17:53.637 --> 17:54.682
No, I just...

17:54.725 --> 17:58.120
want an honest assessment.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.644
But I also don't want
the Church embarrassed.Well,

18:00.688 --> 18:03.691
Kristin is giving us
an honest assessment.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.301
And she's a deal.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.608
Okay. Okay.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.001
I'll get you the money.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.699
Interview Augustus.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.396
Make sure he won't
embarrass us.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.401
Where'd you get this?

18:18.445 --> 18:20.577
Anonymously.
What is that?

18:20.621 --> 18:21.796
I have no idea.

18:21.839 --> 18:24.755
Do you record over
old digital cards?

18:24.799 --> 18:26.453
No. We do not.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.107
What isthat?

18:28.150 --> 18:30.805
I don't know.
A ghost.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.198
An angel?

18:32.241 --> 18:33.808
What do you want it to be?

18:34.939 --> 18:36.419
What?

18:36.463 --> 18:38.204
It's nothing.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.683
It sounded like
something. What?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.428
I know who that is.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.474
Bernadette May.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.910
Who's that?

18:48.953 --> 18:51.042
She's a teacher's aide
who was admitted to the hospital

18:51.086 --> 18:53.610
three days earlier, 
with a migraine.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.090
So it was an old digital chip

18:55.134 --> 18:56.831
that someone recorded over.No.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.573
Well... I don't follow.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.445
All right, look,
it's probably nothing.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.577
Well, then, tell us,

19:03.620 --> 19:05.013
what is it?

19:05.056 --> 19:09.017
Bernadette May died
an hour before Naomi.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.845
From a brain aneurism.

19:10.888 --> 19:11.976
Well,
I don't follow.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.630
The figure
we saw in the video,

19:13.674 --> 19:15.502
the one floating.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.765
She died?

19:17.808 --> 19:20.724
This is starting to
sound like a ghost story.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.161
Okay, so, look.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.771
I'm gonna check the recording

19:23.814 --> 19:25.425
and make sure
that it wasn't manipulated.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.296
- Why would someone manipulate it?
- Look, there are these things

19:27.340 --> 19:28.602
that are called deep fakes,
okay?

19:28.645 --> 19:30.647
You can, you can, 
manipulate the pixels

19:30.691 --> 19:32.214
and make it look like
anything you want, you know?

19:32.258 --> 19:35.565
You can turn me into a goat,
you can make me fly, whatever.

19:35.609 --> 19:36.653
So you think that's what
this is, a deep fake?

19:36.697 --> 19:39.613
I don't know. Okay?
I'm looking.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.791
Is he angry with me?

19:43.834 --> 19:47.490
No... he's just angry
at the unsolved.

19:47.534 --> 19:48.796
Miracle priest,
bless me.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.145
Heal me, Father.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.147
You faith has healed you.Bless me, Father.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.453
Put your faith in God.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.415
David.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.505
How are you?Hi, Father.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.203
This is Kristen.
Kristen, Father Augustus.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.595
Pleasure to meet you.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.684
We're looking into the
Naomi Clark situation.

20:07.728 --> 20:10.209
Situation? Is that what
the Church wants to call it?

20:10.252 --> 20:11.514
What would you call it?

20:11.558 --> 20:13.473
Divine intervention.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.388
Jim...

20:15.431 --> 20:17.216
I can smell the whiskey
on your breath.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.784
Maybe you
heard, David.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.004
God uses the sinner
and the just alike.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.223
Is that what happened?

20:24.266 --> 20:26.573
God used you?I don't know.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.531
I felt it.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.272
From her skin.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.666
Something.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.668
Sorry.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.713
I don't have visions like you.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.760
God never liked me.

20:39.803 --> 20:43.590
I talk to Him all
the time, every night.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.679
He's the quietest
roommate in the world.

20:45.722 --> 20:48.595
What did you whisper
to her? Naomi?

20:48.638 --> 20:50.858
In the video?Prayer for the dead.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.990
No, no, no. You
held her hand

20:53.034 --> 20:55.254
and you whispered
something in her ear.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.608
"Don't go. Stay.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.610
Please, God,
let her stay."

21:03.653 --> 21:05.351
I know. Not much
of a prayer.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.788
I'd just given last rites
to another woman upstairs.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.442
She died of a
brain aneurysm.

21:09.485 --> 21:10.834
Bernadette May?

21:10.878 --> 21:14.708
Yeah, she-she grabbed my hand
and looked at me.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.971
She knew
she was dying,

21:17.014 --> 21:20.322
but there was this
look of peace on her,

21:20.366 --> 21:21.932
like she saw
what was coming.

21:21.976 --> 21:25.762
My hand was still warm from her
when I went to the morgue.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.112
That's why I
held onto Naomi.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.766
I didn't want
her to go.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.595
She felt something.

21:32.639 --> 21:35.163
I know she felt it.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.817
So,

21:36.860 --> 21:39.428
you have visions?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.823
Well, a few years ago,

21:42.866 --> 21:46.827
I saw... things.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.177
It was like a dream
or something.

21:49.220 --> 21:52.354
Anyway, that was
a long time ago,

21:52.398 --> 21:54.400
and I was under a lot of stress

21:54.443 --> 21:56.053
and it was just after
my friend died.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.228
Julia?

21:57.272 --> 22:00.057
Yes.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.842
It gave me hope

22:01.885 --> 22:03.452
when I needed it.

22:03.496 --> 22:06.063
But you haven't had
any visions since?

22:06.107 --> 22:08.892
No.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.033
What's that?

22:21.078 --> 22:24.081
I don't know. I'm trying
to figure out if this is a fake.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.736
Is this for
your priest?

22:26.780 --> 22:29.870
- It's for my job.
- Your job for your priest.

22:29.913 --> 22:30.958
Where's this from?

22:31.001 --> 22:33.743
It's a hospital
surveillance camera.

22:33.787 --> 22:37.530
Dad's asking if you're
coming in for prayers.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.967
Yeah, I know,

22:40.010 --> 22:43.405
but you can't blame him
for trying.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.147
What, that's it?

22:46.190 --> 22:49.803
That's it. Six frames.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.108
I don't know.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.328
Something's up
with the pixels.-

22:53.372 --> 22:54.895
If it's a fake,
it's a good one.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.200
What is she supposed to be?

22:56.244 --> 22:57.854
Someone who's dead.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.379
Yeah, I know.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.642
She died
an hour earlier.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.212
Lewis.

23:08.256 --> 23:11.041
I have those two outstanding
cases I promised you.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.174
Great.Here you go.

23:13.217 --> 23:16.003
And I'd really like to thank you
for the contract offer,

23:16.046 --> 23:19.267
but I think I'll have to pass.
This new job, it's...

23:19.310 --> 23:20.616
No need to thank me.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.793
Actually, we came into
an opportunity overnight.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.187
Another forensic psychologist,

23:26.230 --> 23:28.755
one you faced in court.
In fact,

23:28.798 --> 23:32.498
I need you to update him on the
two cases you were working on.

23:32.541 --> 23:35.065
Leland!

23:38.852 --> 23:41.855
It's good to see you again.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.514
Lewis, this guy,
he's a psychopath.

23:48.557 --> 23:49.906
Come on.
No, I'm serious.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.387
He fed information
to the serial killer LeRoux,

23:52.431 --> 23:54.824
and he encouraged
him to kill.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.522
He already told me
his account was hacked.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.698
That is a lie.I saw the evidence,
Kristen.

23:58.741 --> 23:59.960
He's a liar.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.701
He stole my therapy notes.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.746
He got the better of you
in court, okay?

24:03.790 --> 24:05.226
But...I get that you're angry,

24:05.269 --> 24:07.707
but he's a good
forensic psychologist,

24:07.750 --> 24:11.145
so please brief him
on your cases.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.500
Kristen.

24:18.544 --> 24:21.111
Kristen, you left your notes
in the office.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.896
They're not mine.

24:22.939 --> 24:26.290
I know. I just wanted
to talk to you.

24:26.334 --> 24:27.944
We have nothing to say
to each other.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.859
You must be kidding.
We have everything to say.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.295
You're just gonna overturn

24:31.339 --> 24:32.906
everything I did
on these two cases?

24:32.949 --> 24:35.299
Argue to release the guilty?
Imprison the innocent?

24:35.343 --> 24:38.302
Yeah, but not because I'm bad.

24:38.346 --> 24:41.610
Because you're easily
persuaded, Kristen.

24:41.654 --> 24:43.090
You're too soft.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.135
You said so yourself

24:45.179 --> 24:47.834
in therapy session
number 12.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.879
How's David?

24:51.925 --> 24:54.275
Here's the most important thing
to remember about David:

24:54.318 --> 24:57.191
He sells himself
as this good man,

24:57.234 --> 25:00.542
but ask him about
the second time he saw God.

25:00.586 --> 25:03.545
I have no idea what that means.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.155
Yeah, that's why
you need to ask him:

25:05.199 --> 25:07.331
"Tell me, David, about
the second time you saw God,"

25:07.375 --> 25:09.769
and trust me, it's a good story.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.250
Good luck with your "miracle."

25:30.224 --> 25:32.835
Mom! Mom!

25:32.879 --> 25:35.838
Daughters! Who'd you kill?

25:35.882 --> 25:38.232
The postman. He was trying
to deliver mail and...

25:40.756 --> 25:43.063
All right, well, don't forget
to clean up with Lysol.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.194
We will.

25:44.238 --> 25:45.282
We got it!You're home a little late.

25:45.326 --> 25:46.762
You said 8:00.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.156
Yes. And thank you for being
so patient, Mom.

25:49.199 --> 25:51.114
She wasn't so patient.Yes, she was.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.508
I watched
your scary little show.

25:55.336 --> 25:58.295
I'm getting
way too old for this.

25:58.339 --> 26:01.168
What happened?

26:01.211 --> 26:02.691
You look like
something went wrong.

26:02.735 --> 26:06.042
No, I'm-I'm-I'm just...

26:06.086 --> 26:08.218
I'm just really happy
to be home with my mom

26:08.262 --> 26:10.090
and my daughters.Okay, so you're
not gonna tell me.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.919
So what are we watching?

26:12.962 --> 26:14.355
A scary show.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.226
Wow, that is so nice of Grandma

26:16.270 --> 26:18.098
to just let you watch
whatever you want.

26:18.141 --> 26:21.101
Okay, I'm leaving now.
Hey, kids, listen up--

26:21.144 --> 26:23.625
misbehave, okay?
Do not listen to your mother.

26:23.669 --> 26:24.887
- She's too strict.
- Okay.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.280
I love you, Mom.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.412
All right.

26:30.327 --> 26:33.983
Mom, don't joke like that.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.506
What are we watching?

26:35.550 --> 26:37.378
You've seen it, Mom.
You said it looked good.

26:37.421 --> 26:40.207
What did you do with
the toy spider, and the...

26:40.250 --> 26:42.252
So do I have to watch it
from the beginning?

26:42.296 --> 26:43.776
No, they moved
into a new house.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.038
And it's haunted.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.822
- Dad!
- Where's the mom?

26:46.866 --> 26:48.737
She's dead.
She died in a car crash.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.391
Of course she did.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.001
Why'd you say it
like that?

26:52.045 --> 26:54.438
Well, because in movies,
the mom's always dead.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.614
Movies hate moms.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.354
Okay, turn out
the lights.

26:57.398 --> 27:00.444
Guys, is this really
a good idea?

27:01.663 --> 27:04.361
I'm not even scared.I'm a bit scared.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.407
You're really gonna
like this part.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.454
Don't open the door!

27:10.498 --> 27:12.108
My gosh!
Don't open the door!

27:12.152 --> 27:13.544
Mom! Are you kidding me?

27:13.588 --> 27:15.416
I don't want to
have to cover your mouth.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.940
But why would she
open the door if it's so...

27:30.823 --> 27:32.128
What are you doing?That's the only part

27:32.172 --> 27:33.826
I wasn't scared.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.529
Bedtime.That's the only part
I wasn't scared.

27:41.572 --> 27:42.704
No! Mom!

27:42.748 --> 27:46.403
Let's go.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.014
You've let us watch a lot worse.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.972
And moms sometimes
make mistakes.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.278
Yeah, maybe this
is the mistake.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.715
Yes, maybe. Let's go.
Upstairs. Bedtime.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.413
Maybe we'll have nightmares
if you don't let us watch it.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.720
That's exactly how that works.
Let's go.

27:58.764 --> 27:59.982
No, Laura, hold on,
wait one second.

28:00.026 --> 28:01.636
- I want to ask you something.
- What?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.855
What did I do? Nothing.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.073
I just want to
ask you something.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.423
No, you guys all go up.That's so unfair.

28:06.467 --> 28:07.860
She's just gonna
convince you to watch...

28:07.903 --> 28:10.384
That thing in the video,
that demon,

28:10.427 --> 28:12.778
is that what you saw
in your nightmare?

28:14.475 --> 28:18.000
You said it had a knife
and big teeth.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.960
I think when you have
dreams and nightmares,

28:21.003 --> 28:23.571
it usually comes from stuff
you saw during the day.

28:23.614 --> 28:26.443
Is that why you didn't
want us to watch it?

28:26.487 --> 28:29.011
I think
I saw it, too.

28:29.055 --> 28:30.447
I don't remember when,

28:30.491 --> 28:32.885
but I think I saw that
same thing in my nightmare.

28:32.928 --> 28:36.323
But now that we know,
we can face it.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.804
It's not real.
It's just from that TV show.

28:38.847 --> 28:41.328
Streaming.Streaming show.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.896
So don't be scared.
It all makes sense, okay?

28:43.939 --> 28:45.375
Can I sleep with you?

28:45.419 --> 28:47.769
One more night?

29:32.553 --> 29:34.729
Who is it?

30:02.757 --> 30:03.976
Hey!

30:14.769 --> 30:17.859
Laura, Lexis, Lynn, Lila!

30:17.903 --> 30:21.820
Open the door! Lila, Lila!

30:30.002 --> 30:31.525
Bad dream?

30:31.568 --> 30:35.268
Try counting sheep.

30:35.311 --> 30:38.532
You're part of my mind.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.186
You're not even
original.

30:40.229 --> 30:42.101
You're from a bad TV show.

30:42.144 --> 30:43.929
Bad?

30:43.972 --> 30:47.193
Well, that's just hurtful.

30:52.372 --> 30:55.636
You know what's great
about a night terror, Kristen?

30:55.679 --> 30:57.159
You can't move.

30:57.203 --> 31:00.206
Just your eyes.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.990
Watch the knife.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.993
Wake up.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.952
Wake up.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.910
Well, just grab the knife,
Kristen.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.739
Come on,
move that hand.

31:11.782 --> 31:14.220
How hard can it be?

31:14.263 --> 31:16.309
Wake up. Wake up.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.964
How about her heart?

31:19.007 --> 31:21.880
Which valve shall I take out?
The mitral?

31:21.923 --> 31:24.926
Why are we waiting
until she's 20?

31:24.970 --> 31:26.493
Let's finish it now.

31:26.536 --> 31:27.929
Laura, please.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.540
Laura, please, wake up.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.107
Mom, wake up. Mom!

31:32.151 --> 31:34.327
Mom!

31:39.071 --> 31:40.942
You were having a nightmare.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.945
I know. I'm sorry, I was.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.947
My gosh.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.386
I'll hold you, Mom.

31:50.430 --> 31:53.085
You go to sleep,
I'll hold you.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.957
Thank you. You're
such a good baby.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.960
You're my sweet baby.

31:59.004 --> 32:02.529
And this was yesterday?KRISTEN: Yeah.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.487
What did he say?

32:04.531 --> 32:06.707
He said he was gonna
reverse everything I did.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.622
Every innocent person
would be guilty,

32:08.665 --> 32:11.233
and every guilty person
would be innocent.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.800
And did you tell your boss?

32:12.843 --> 32:14.802
Yeah, I told him Townsend
was a psychopath,

32:14.845 --> 32:18.284
and he thought it was
professional jealousy.

32:18.327 --> 32:20.895
He also knew that we were
investigating a miracle.

32:23.202 --> 32:25.073
He's coming after us.

32:25.117 --> 32:27.815
Why?

32:27.858 --> 32:30.687
Why, David?
Why is he coming after us?

32:30.731 --> 32:34.691
I want to tell you, but it's not
a language you believe.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.084
Because you think he's a demon?

32:36.128 --> 32:37.477
Yes.

32:39.305 --> 32:42.177
So tell me in language
I'll believe.

32:42.221 --> 32:44.571
He wants to kill hope.

32:48.053 --> 32:50.881
He also suggested
I ask you something.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.667
What?

32:53.710 --> 32:58.367
He suggested I ask you about
the second time you saw God?

33:03.024 --> 33:04.460
What does that mean?

33:04.504 --> 33:06.071
He wants to divide us.

33:06.114 --> 33:09.813
Why would that divide us?

33:09.857 --> 33:12.120
I had a vision.

33:12.164 --> 33:13.992
Now I don't.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.604
He's playing on my doubt.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.171
And yours.

33:23.305 --> 33:27.788
There wasn't, like, a-a tunnel
or a light or anything.

33:27.831 --> 33:32.140
I remember seeing my coach
yelling from the sidelines.

33:32.184 --> 33:35.317
And then I felt my face
on the ground.

33:35.361 --> 33:37.580
And then I saw this hole

33:37.624 --> 33:41.193
opening up in the grass,

33:41.236 --> 33:42.411
a black hole.

33:42.455 --> 33:45.371
Just, like, this...

33:45.414 --> 33:49.375
big, swirling thing.

33:49.418 --> 33:51.377
And then I saw people
coming out of it.

33:51.420 --> 33:54.075
A lot of people.
60 of them?

33:55.816 --> 33:58.993
And they were coming for me.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.256
And then I saw a woman

34:01.300 --> 34:03.041
take my hand.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.043
I didn't know who she was,

34:05.086 --> 34:08.045
but my parents said that there
was another girl who died.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.917
Bernadette May.Right.

34:09.960 --> 34:15.226
She took my hand, and then
I felt this on my cheek.

34:17.533 --> 34:20.362
And that's when I woke up.

34:20.406 --> 34:24.627
Do you think what happened
to you is a miracle?

34:25.976 --> 34:29.328
Um, I don't know.

34:29.371 --> 34:33.766
All I know is that
I was dead and now I'm not.

34:33.810 --> 34:35.812
And that everything
has changed for me.

34:39.380 --> 34:42.341
I can't figure out
how they faked this.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.386
We checked the pixels.

34:44.429 --> 34:46.388
There's no apparent
manipulation,

34:46.431 --> 34:50.349
so either this is so good
that we will never know

34:50.391 --> 34:52.393
how they did it...Who's "they?"

34:52.438 --> 34:54.309
"They," just figurative "they."

34:54.353 --> 34:55.963
You know, not-- O-Okay.
Ju-- Or...

34:57.225 --> 34:59.749
...one other option:
ground-looping.

34:59.793 --> 35:02.317
And what's that?Okay. You see this,

35:02.361 --> 35:06.191
surveillance footage of
Bernadette May an hour earlier?

35:06.234 --> 35:08.062
And this is our footage
of Naomi.KRISTEN:

35:08.106 --> 35:09.629
These images were transmitted

35:09.672 --> 35:12.153
to the security station
which recorded them.

35:12.197 --> 35:16.679
Now, ground-looping is when
those two transmissions cross.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.420
So you think the
image of Bernadette

35:18.464 --> 35:21.293
- somehow got superimposed...
- Over Naomi's image.

35:21.336 --> 35:23.295
That's right. Right. 
So, if that's true...

35:23.338 --> 35:24.731
the image
of Bernadette's face

35:24.774 --> 35:26.385
should at some point
appear on the monitor.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.300
- Yep.
- And does it?

35:28.343 --> 35:29.605
Well, I've gone through
through several hours

35:29.649 --> 35:31.738
of surveillance
footage. Right now,

35:31.781 --> 35:33.696
have seen nothing yet,
but...

35:41.400 --> 35:43.402
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
go back to the beginning.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.317
Wait.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.057
The doctor just called
the time of death.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.407
Yeah, so?

35:48.450 --> 35:51.932
I think I know what happened.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.499
It's not a miracle.

35:59.896 --> 36:02.595
So I'm glad you've agreed
with us it's not a miracle.

36:02.638 --> 36:03.596
Yep. Turned out
to be hyperinflation

36:03.639 --> 36:05.946
and undiagnosed COPD.Good.

36:05.989 --> 36:08.470
But it wasn't the, 
paramedics' fault.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.211
Well, I think we'll have
to agree to disagree on that,

36:10.255 --> 36:11.604
but it's good
we're on the same side.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.477
What are those?

36:15.521 --> 36:17.044
Emergency lifesaving efforts

36:17.087 --> 36:19.133
of this hospital
over the last year.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.787
176 in all.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.310
Okay.

36:22.354 --> 36:24.051
These are
your Caucasian patients.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.575
Did you know that, on average,
during a code, your doctors

36:26.619 --> 36:28.273
performed 58 minutes
of chest compressions

36:28.316 --> 36:30.884
and rescue breathing
on Caucasian patients?

36:30.927 --> 36:34.409
Patients like, 
Bernadette May?

36:34.453 --> 36:36.150
No, I didn't.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.239
And these are your
African-American patients.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.241
Your doctors,
on average, performed

36:40.285 --> 36:41.721
chest compressions
and rescue breathing

36:41.764 --> 36:43.418
for 23 minutes on them.

36:43.462 --> 36:47.596
Patients like, Naomi Clark.

36:49.642 --> 36:52.122
It is the stated position
of this hospital

36:52.166 --> 36:54.603
that it does not distinguish
on the basis of race.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.649
Naomi Clark came
back to life

36:56.692 --> 37:00.435
in the morgue because your ER
staff called her time of death

37:00.479 --> 37:03.308
30 minutes earlier
than if she were white.

37:03.351 --> 37:05.745
That's why this
wasn't a miracle.

37:05.788 --> 37:08.051
It was implicit racism.

37:12.099 --> 37:14.319
I think you should
get out of here.

37:16.973 --> 37:20.455
Here, I'll leave these for you.

37:20.499 --> 37:23.328
The ethical review board
already reviewed our actions.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.286
And the malpractice suit
has already been settled.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.462
You might want to check on that.

37:28.681 --> 37:29.943
You might want
to look at that

37:29.986 --> 37:32.075
before you settle the
Harbor Hospital suit.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.816
Why? What is it?Evidence for

37:33.860 --> 37:37.472
a civil rights lawsuit
worth about $15 million.

37:43.826 --> 37:46.873
So, it was not a miracle?

37:46.916 --> 37:48.396
No.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.398
A combination
of gross incompetence

37:50.442 --> 37:52.879
and a medical condition
that kept Ms. Clark's lungs

37:52.922 --> 37:54.359
from absorbing oxygen.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.275
Okay, good work.

37:57.318 --> 38:00.103
I have another possible
possession for you...

38:00.147 --> 38:02.802
Actually,
there's one other thing.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.847
A patient died an hour earlier,

38:04.891 --> 38:09.243
and this is an image of her
on the hospital videotape.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.641
This has nothing to do
with the miracle?

38:15.684 --> 38:18.078
No, it's just an apparition
we can't explain.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.472
Okay. Well, then,
let's let that go.

38:22.082 --> 38:24.780
Now, this possession
we want you to look into,

38:24.824 --> 38:26.565
it's a
good parishioner.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.393
She gives a lot
to the Church...

38:34.442 --> 38:36.052
Mom, hey.

38:40.709 --> 38:43.146
Okay, it's not working.
I saw what you were watching.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.713
Mom, just let us
watch the end, please. Come on.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.194
It's not that scary.
It's more funny than scary.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.804
It's actually hilarious.
We were laughing so...

38:48.848 --> 38:51.372
Okay, this is what I say.
I'm gonna watch it with you.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.070
Yes.No, wait. Wait. But first,

38:54.114 --> 38:56.856
we are gonna all
watch this together.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.336
What is it?

38:58.379 --> 39:00.033
Just watch.

39:00.076 --> 39:02.035
Um, typically it takes,

39:02.078 --> 39:04.820
to make a monster,
it takes about three hours.

39:04.864 --> 39:08.128
- What is this?
- It's a video on how they do it.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.956
There are a lot of elements
to this character.

39:09.999 --> 39:13.351
There's a bodysuit,
there's a cowl piece.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.743
There are two ear pieces.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.310
There's teeth,
and then our horns...

39:16.354 --> 39:18.573
It's good for us
to know it's not real.

39:18.617 --> 39:21.576
It's all make-believe.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.144
Well, my ideas come to me
while I'm sleeping.

39:24.187 --> 39:26.059
They come to me
in the form of nightmares.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.322
I translate that really quickly

39:28.366 --> 39:30.977
into a sketch or, like,
a quick clay sculpture,

39:31.020 --> 39:35.416
only to be translated into
a full-size character later.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.418
Do you, like
playing monsters?

39:37.462 --> 39:39.551
Monsters scare me when I see
them on TV or film,

39:39.594 --> 39:41.553
but when I'm playing one,
it's not that bad.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.685
It's fun to scare other people
as the monster.

39:46.253 --> 39:47.776
My God.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.430
As it is in heaven.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.955
Give us this day our daily bread

39:52.999 --> 39:54.914
and forgive us...

39:54.957 --> 39:59.397
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

39:59.440 --> 40:03.531
Lead us not into temptation,

40:03.575 --> 40:06.055
but deliver us from all evil.

40:34.606 --> 40:37.260
Where's your girlfriend?

40:39.349 --> 40:42.091
Gone.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.919
What do you got?

40:44.964 --> 40:48.010
Ketamine, E, Molly,

40:48.054 --> 40:49.272
and caps.

41:12.382 --> 41:13.993
Thy will be done...

41:16.299 --> 41:18.127
on Earth...

41:20.173 --> 41:22.871
Where are you, God?

42:15.228 --> 42:17.186
Julia?

42:18.305 --> 42:24.545
