is that there are

and here you are
in this same town.

wouldn't you say?

09:11.440 --> 09:15.832

Guess I'm glad I kept him alive.

10:17.520 --> 10:20.114
Oh, so I'm safer
with that psycho?

10:20.200 --> 10:23.397

where that came from.

doses nearby.

is Americans to die

it tastes like crap on toast,

13:36.880 --> 13:38.029
but it'll help
wash out the drugs.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.555
How do you feel?

13:44.560 --> 13:45.834
I'm okay, I think.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.558
Jeez.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.398
What?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.515
It's an act.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.597
You cut him loose,
he will kill us both.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.235
You can't fix him.

so I can help.

No, you can't.
We can't even bring him.

- I'm all right.
- Allenford: He's not all right.

He will shout to them,
give away our position.

- I won't!
- He's lying!

- Shut up.

No, Miles. I'm not all right.
I'm hungry.

you're a good listener.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.550
Dr. Porter.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.675
Did she say anything?

16:42.200 --> 16:43.395
She hasn't said anything.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.111
She's been arguing
with my granddaughter,

16:47.200 --> 16:49.874
but that's about it.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.152
Well...

16:59.240 --> 17:02.232
You'll report to me
if she does say anything.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.315
Of course.

17:31.160 --> 17:34.039
(WATER POURING,
MAN CHOKING)

17:42.600 --> 17:44.876
(CHOKING CONTINUES)

17:52.040 --> 17:53.678
Please...

17:53.800 --> 17:56.110
I just want to go home.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.480
I have a daughter.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.030
Please.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.396
He's out again.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.391
Doc,
a little wake-up juice, please?

18:30.840 --> 18:32.877
Doc.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.319
Now.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.034
(GASPS)

18:59.840 --> 19:00.830
Thanks, doc.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.711
Now... where were we?

19:09.120 --> 19:10.997
(CHOKING CONTINUES)

19:29.080 --> 19:30.150
Hey.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.400
Who was he, Shaw?

19:37.480 --> 19:38.470
He was from Austin...

19:39.960 --> 19:41.678
and an enemy
of the United States.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.513
Or maybe he was
just some poor bastard

19:45.600 --> 19:46.954
who wanted to see his kid.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.754
What you did in there...

19:56.920 --> 19:58.149
...it's too far.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.032
It-- it--

20:00.120 --> 20:01.633
It's not right.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.234
Your wagon's loaded.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.759
We got you meds for TB

20:11.800 --> 20:14.235
and yellow fever this time.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.873
500 doses each.

20:21.880 --> 20:25.316
Doc... we're the good guys,
remember?

20:36.120 --> 20:37.269
<i>Charlie: I scouted the wall.</i>

20:37.320 --> 20:38.355
All double covered.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.831
And there's got to be at least
a hundred more soldiers in town.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.479
Why? What are they planning?

20:45.320 --> 20:46.993
Nothing good.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.998
Well, unless we can get Aaron
to charge through the wall

20:50.040 --> 20:53.078
Kool-Aid style,
I'm out of ideas.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.150
Porter: I can do it.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.035
I'll get him out.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.396
Cynthia too.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.996
Dad, I-- I think maybe
you should stay out of it.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.030
I know about Aaron.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.872
Porter: I've been listening
to y'all talk for weeks.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.600
You're not
as quiet as you think,

21:13.680 --> 21:16.035
and if these people
are as bad as you say...

21:17.960 --> 21:18.916
...we got to get them out.

21:23.160 --> 21:23.877
How you gonna do that?

21:27.480 --> 21:30.871
Porter: Once a week I head out
to pick up cottonwood,

21:30.960 --> 21:33.600
yarrow bark, some other meds,
and I store it...

21:33.720 --> 21:35.313
(DOOR CREAKING)

21:36.360 --> 21:38.556
...in here.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.795
Cozy.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.036
Miles: So what makes you think

21:42.080 --> 21:43.354
they're just gonna
let you out of here?

21:43.400 --> 21:44.390
Porter: The town still needs medicine.

21:44.480 --> 21:47.313
Troops do too.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.040
I can sneak Aaron past,
right out to Monroe.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.440
Absolutely not.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.715
What if they search
the wagon?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.438
- They won't.
- Security's tight as a drum.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.080
Rachel, I need to do this.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.078
I've turned a blind eye to
what these sons of bitches

22:07.120 --> 22:08.554
were doing for too long.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.315
People are dying,
and I've got to do something.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.117
I think we're okay--
(GUNFIRE)

23:41.520 --> 23:43.750
I am Cadet Jason Neville!
I'm captive!

23:43.840 --> 23:44.750
Allenford: Where are you going?

23:44.840 --> 23:48.037
I'm Patriot cadet Jason Neville!

23:48.120 --> 23:49.190
I'm a captive!

23:50.880 --> 23:52.518
I'm a Patriot! I'm coming in!

24:04.440 --> 24:05.430
<i>Jason". Come on out! It's safe.</i>

24:08.920 --> 24:09.990
Torn.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.519
No.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.394
You ready?

25:37.280 --> 25:41.114
I'm sorry to do this to you.
I know this is home.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.078
No, Aaron.

25:46.120 --> 25:50.079
Wherever we go, you and me,

25:50.120 --> 25:51.235
that's home.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.834
What's up, doc?

26:10.880 --> 26:12.996
Shaw.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.269
It's been a while, Gene.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.071
You look like hell,
if you don't mind my saying.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.399
Horn wants to see you.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.159
Horn: Dr. Porter.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.515
How can I help you, doctor?

26:41.600 --> 26:44.194
Well, you can start...

26:46.560 --> 26:48.358
...by telling me
everything you know

26:48.400 --> 26:49.595
about Aaron Pittman.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.589
Aaron Pittman?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.358
What about him?

27:02.400 --> 27:04.232
Well, he died.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.277
You were his doctor.
You declared him dead.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.556
It's a small town, doctor.
You hear things.

27:11.640 --> 27:15.031
Well, obviously,
I made a mistake.

27:15.120 --> 27:18.750
The way I heard it,
he came back to life,

27:18.840 --> 27:20.433
quite dramatically.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.320
So is he Jesus?

27:29.640 --> 27:32.393
Let's assume for argument's
sake he's not Jesus.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.391
Then how else could
he have been brought back,

27:37.440 --> 27:38.794
besides the thing,

27:38.880 --> 27:41.520
the exact thing
that I'm looking for?

27:44.440 --> 27:46.909
So how did she do it?

27:46.960 --> 27:47.950
Who?

27:50.600 --> 27:53.592
You think
Rachel brought him back?

27:55.640 --> 27:56.994
I'm only asking once.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.438
Where's Pittman?

28:00.480 --> 28:03.074
'Cause he's not at home
or at the school.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.592
Is your daughter hiding him?

28:07.640 --> 28:08.835
No.

28:09.960 --> 28:10.995
I don't know where he is.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.590
I must seem like a joke to you.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.719
Someone you can
laugh at and lie to.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.950
- No, that's not true.
- Horn: Then why are you lying?

28:27.000 --> 28:30.197
You know my reputation.
You know what I'll do to you.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.274
It doesn't have to be this way.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.997
You're one of us, aren't you?

28:40.800 --> 28:42.359
Horn: You've been with us for years.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.399
I thought--

28:48.200 --> 28:49.793
What, doctor?

28:52.600 --> 28:54.830
I thought
I was helping this town,

28:54.960 --> 28:58.316
helping the United States,

28:58.400 --> 28:59.629
but I was wrong.

29:02.160 --> 29:05.152
It's a little late to be
clutching your pearls, doctor.

29:05.240 --> 29:09.473
All those times you gave
a hand to Shaw here.

29:09.520 --> 29:10.794
I never killed anybody.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.150
No.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.356
You just watched.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.040
Never asked
too many questions,

29:18.120 --> 29:20.396
always looked the other way,

29:20.480 --> 29:23.074
so you can get your meds

29:23.160 --> 29:24.480
and be a big hero back in town.

29:27.720 --> 29:28.835
No.

29:31.840 --> 29:32.910
Don't forget...

29:35.360 --> 29:37.112
...you're the one
who opened the door

29:37.200 --> 29:39.396
and let us in.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.949
We're here because of you.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.149
So let me make this simple.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.512
You tell me
what I want to know,

29:50.600 --> 29:52.910
or I start killing
your precious town people,

29:53.000 --> 29:54.752
one after another
while you watch.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.872
We'll save
your granddaughter for last.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.310
Rachel...

30:13.880 --> 30:14.950
A little louder, doctor.

30:21.840 --> 30:25.913
Rachel isn't...

30:26.000 --> 30:27.991
controlling
those machines of yours.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.949
Aaron is.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.236
I don't know how, but he is.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.913
All right.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.837
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

30:50.640 --> 30:52.153
Where is he?

31:14.440 --> 31:15.669
It's them.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.795
So where are they?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.516
I'm sorry.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.193
I did not want to be
right about this.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.315
He's one of them.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.196
Miles: They knew about
our plans with Texas.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.874
They knew where to grab Monroe.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.355
How else could they have known?

32:16.440 --> 32:17.999
When I looked in his eyes,
it just clicked.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.836
Trust me, I know what desperate
and guilty look like.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.515
Hey.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.950
I'm really sorry,

32:35.040 --> 32:36.360
but you can't do this
right now.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.753
We got to get Aaron out of here.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.749
Staring at that fire like
it's got all the answers.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.397
I think I've got to go.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.278
Go?
(CHUCKLING)

33:03.360 --> 33:05.237
Go where?

33:05.280 --> 33:07.112
North.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.918
My son is stationed
near Cincinnati.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.513
So...

33:13.560 --> 33:14.630
You're a wanted fugitive.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.237
Any Patriots you see
will shoot you on sight.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.634
He's my son.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.999
Twenty-four hours ago,
your boy was trying

33:30.080 --> 33:31.912
to put a bullet in you,

33:32.000 --> 33:33.911
and look at him now.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.355
He just saved your life.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.351
If there's even a chance
that I could have that again

33:38.440 --> 33:39.714
with my son...

33:45.600 --> 33:47.830
I should have never
given up on him, you know?

33:47.960 --> 33:51.430
I feel, um--

33:51.480 --> 33:52.959
I feel-- I don't--

34:03.720 --> 34:04.710
What'd you give her?

34:16.960 --> 34:19.600
You got stood up.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.119
No, something
must have happened.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.514
Yeah, what clearly happened
is your cover got blown.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.157
I wonder what your daughter
will think of you now.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.350
Miles: Hey!

34:45.440 --> 34:46.396
Oh, you don't have it open yet?

34:46.520 --> 34:47.840
No, it's jammed.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.154
Well, un-jam it.

34:49.239 --> 34:50.275
What the hell happened?

34:50.320 --> 34:52.118
Why did we change the plan?

34:52.159 --> 34:53.719
Ran into some trouble.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.516
Is Grandpa okay?

34:54.840 --> 34:56.672
He's fine. Trust me.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.349
Miles,
this sewer could be caved in.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.720
It could be blocked.
We have no idea.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.679
That's why we call it plan B.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.876
Truman: And when I say everywhere,
I mean everywhere.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.630
Search every house,
every alley, every damn shed.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.875
Use all necessary force.

35:12.920 --> 35:16.151
Just keep Pittman
and Rachel Matheson alive.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.190
Well, what are you waiting for?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.279
Is this sewer line still open?

35:26.840 --> 35:27.750
No, I got it. I got it.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.750
You're gonna
get all macho on me now?

35:28.840 --> 35:29.910
You only got one hand.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.560
Mom, you all right?

35:35.640 --> 35:36.710
I'm okay.

35:40.440 --> 35:41.510
Open it.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.230
And that would be for us.

35:49.920 --> 35:53.072
So that's what 15-year-old
crap smells like.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.150
Get in. Go.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.594
Aaron?
(PANTING)

36:13.680 --> 36:14.750
You're doing great.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.553
Somebody get me a crowbar.

36:31.600 --> 36:32.749
I can see light.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.270
Is this it?

36:38.560 --> 36:39.550
It better be.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.270
They were in here.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.274
Find out where that thing goes.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.556
(GUN COCKING)

37:17.040 --> 37:18.269
Get out, let's go!

just take it easy.

I'm Aaron Pittman!

- Aaron!
- It's me you want, right?

38:11.600 --> 38:13.398

Just let her go!

39:32.320 --> 39:35.153
Tom: See, you were so worried
about trusting my son,

39:35.240 --> 39:37.231
when you should have been
worried about trusting me.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.719
You son of a bitch.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.713
You said your husband
was Patriot High Command.

39:43.800 --> 39:44.710
Am I right?

39:44.800 --> 39:46.791
What do you want?

39:49.880 --> 39:51.678
Where is the old ball and chain?

40:00.480 --> 40:03.120
Aaron, you have got to tell me
how you do that.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.877
It's okay. You don't have
to be afraid of him.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.710
But it's not him
you're afraid of, is it?

40:31.840 --> 40:34.354
I'm feeling frustrated,
Dr. Porter.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.355
I'm feeling upset.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.511
Porter: I don't know
where Aaron Pittman is...

40:42.440 --> 40:43.430
...but I'll find him.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.553
I hope so.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.075
Because if I find
your daughter first,

40:51.160 --> 40:52.230
feeling the way I feel...

40:56.760 --> 40:58.910
I'm worried I won't be
able to control myself.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.190
We can't stay here long.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.275
They're searching
every building.

41:19.200 --> 41:19.996
Miles.

41:21.760 --> 41:22.750
She needs a minute.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.553
Will one of you tell me
what's going on, please?

41:26.800 --> 41:28.234
