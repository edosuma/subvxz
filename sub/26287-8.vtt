00:02.803 --> 00:03.937
MAN:
Will, another martini?

00:03.937 --> 00:05.539
Three olives, right?
I’ll be right back.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.708
How are my lovebirds?
Everybody good?

00:07.708 --> 00:10.010
All right. Good deal.
Let me get that chair.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.279
Angela, that’s a hell
of a dress.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.948
Dessert’s on me.
Come on, eat up.

00:14.948 --> 00:18.619
Mr. Stavos. I didn’t know
you were coming in tonight.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.953
I’d like my
corner booth.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.623
As you can see, I’ve seated
people there already,

00:22.623 --> 00:24.391
but you’re welcome
to sit at the bar.

00:24.391 --> 00:25.959
First round’s
on the house.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.295
Next time, have
my table ready.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.031
Don’t ever
disrespect me again.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.420
You’re a good man.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.189
You okay?

00:56.189 --> 00:57.591
You look a little rare.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.494
Just a long day’s night,
Mr. Corsetti.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.864
You have a good one.
You, too.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.502
Oh, hey, what are you doing?

01:08.502 --> 01:10.304
Hold up. I work here!

01:10.304 --> 01:11.939
We-we ran out
of space

01:11.939 --> 01:13.941
in the lot.
It’s on the hook, pal.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.876
Too late, you know?
What’s done is done.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.111
I don’t care whether it’s...
What is that?

01:19.947 --> 01:22.349
I don’t know. It’s your car.
No, no. What is that?

01:22.349 --> 01:23.817
What?

01:23.817 --> 01:26.153
Get away from the car.
Get away from the car.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.522
Run, run!

01:45.272 --> 01:48.408
NATALIE: Cole, what is it? You
have been blowing up my phone.

01:48.408 --> 01:51.111
True, but only ’cause
I was hoping we could talk.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.914
Uh, yeah, I got that
from the six missed calls.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.550
Cole, I’m at work.
What is the emergency?

01:56.550 --> 01:57.751
Well, we kissed.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.952
Yeah, I was there.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.253
It was pretty great, right?

02:00.253 --> 02:02.889
It was... nice,

02:02.889 --> 02:04.858
but we cannot talk
about this right now.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.560
Because you’re at work?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.362
Right, and honestly because

02:08.362 --> 02:10.564
I don’t know what to say.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.332
It’s just a little messy,
you know?

02:12.332 --> 02:15.202
The kiss? I mean,
I can adjust my approach.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.537
No, not...

02:17.537 --> 02:18.872
You know I have a boyfriend.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.842
Right. How did Andrew
take the bad news?

02:21.842 --> 02:24.077
No, Cole, I didn’t tell him.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.314
So you’re saying...
Wait, what are you saying?

02:27.314 --> 02:30.217
I don’t, I don’t know.
I don’t know what I’m saying.

02:30.217 --> 02:33.186
I’m confused.
Well, we could fix that.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.223
How about you and I meet? You
know, we can talk it all out,

02:36.223 --> 02:37.424
face to face.
Hey.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.826
Got the tickets. Who’s that?

02:39.826 --> 02:42.095
Oh, uh, it’s just some idiot

02:42.095 --> 02:44.297
trying to sell me something.
Is that Andrew?

02:44.297 --> 02:45.499
Tickets

02:45.499 --> 02:46.933
I’m almost done.
No problem.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.035
I’m excited for tomorrow.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.870
Yeah.
It’s gonna be a big night.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.105
Big night? No, no, no.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.442
Listen, Natalie,
I have to see you tonight, okay?

02:55.442 --> 02:56.376
Half hour, please.

02:56.376 --> 02:59.413
Okay, okay, tonight,
but now I have to go.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.180
Wait.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.882
Natalie, if Andrew
asks you anything

03:01.882 --> 03:03.150
before then,
just don’t...

03:06.086 --> 03:07.320
Uh-oh.

03:07.320 --> 03:11.792
Come on, man. God.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.196
You okay?

03:16.196 --> 03:19.766
No. I literally
just got my car fixed,

03:19.766 --> 03:22.102
just pulled off the lot.
I can’t believe this happened.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.404
Hey. Don’t blame yourself.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.673
I don’t. I blame you.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.410
Were you just on your phone?

03:30.410 --> 03:32.946
While driving?
Uh-huh.

03:32.946 --> 03:33.980
Never.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.216
WOMAN :
Erica

03:36.216 --> 03:38.952
Did you just get
into an accident?

03:38.952 --> 03:40.921
Um, Mom, I’m fine.
I will call you back.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.291
Sounds like we were both
on our phones, Erica.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.227
Hands-free, speaker.
Little different.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.428
MOM:
Who is that?

03:48.428 --> 03:49.963
You want me to talk to him?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.032
Hi, Erica’s mom.
Your daughter’s fine.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.801
Little judgy, maybe.
Okay, Mom,

03:54.801 --> 03:56.336
hang up, I’ll call you back.

03:56.336 --> 03:57.671
You, license, insurance, now.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.805
Does it make
a difference

03:58.805 --> 04:00.674
that I was on the phone
reconnecting

04:00.674 --> 04:03.043
with the love
of my life?
Aw.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.679
I’ll get my wallet.
Okay.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.984
So, Roger, Riana is out
of the house tonight,

04:10.984 --> 04:14.121
Harper is at my mom’s,

04:14.121 --> 04:18.325
so... what are
your plans tonight?

04:18.325 --> 04:21.795
For you, baby,
I can be home and showered

04:21.795 --> 04:24.931
and ready to "uh, uh, uh"
by 7:00.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.200
That sounds so good.
Mm-hmm.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.768
But I have girls’
night tonight.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.203
And I’m hosting.

04:30.203 --> 04:33.907
Didn’t you just host a girls’
night, like, a week ago?

04:33.907 --> 04:36.109
A month ago,
and I cancelled

04:36.109 --> 04:39.946
because you demanded we watch
Top Chef finale together.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.482
It was worth
every minute.
Mm-hmm.

04:42.482 --> 04:45.685
Well, make yourself scarce
from 7:00 to 12:00.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.287
Five hours?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.956
You’re gonna talk about
baking the potato

04:49.956 --> 04:51.424
for five hours?
What?

04:51.424 --> 04:53.160
Hiding the turtle.
What?

04:53.160 --> 04:56.563
Taming the monkey.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.031
You mean sex?
Yes.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.167
Okay, honey, this may
come as a shock,

05:00.167 --> 05:02.002
but we talk about
more than sex.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.703
Yeah, right.
We do!

05:03.703 --> 05:06.239
That Shana keeps giving me
the stanky eye

05:06.239 --> 05:09.309
like she knows things about me,
erotic things.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.145
Okay, honey, we talk
about everything.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.115
And deep conversation with
friends can go on for hours.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.950
It’s like you lose
track of time.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.385
You should try it.

05:18.385 --> 05:21.588
You trying to say
I don’t have any close friends?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.957
I’m saying

05:23.957 --> 05:26.593
don’t walk through that
door before midnight.

05:26.593 --> 05:29.629
That’s all.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.031
COLE: Tonight?
MURTAUGH: Yeah.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.066
Nah, sorry, buddy,
I got plans.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.002
I’m meeting Natalie.
I got a needle to thread.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.270
Why don’t you
thread it tomorrow?

05:37.270 --> 05:39.439
Can’t.
My window’s closing.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.908
Andrew told Natalie tomorrow’s
gonna be a "big night."

05:41.908 --> 05:44.845
You know, uh...

05:44.845 --> 05:47.847
if you want to do
a deep dive on this,

05:47.847 --> 05:49.983
you just let me know.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.352
Deep dive?
Yeah, you know,
talk it out.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.589
Have a boys’ night.
Lose track of time.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.857
Roger, were you
even listening?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.559
Natalie. Window. Needle.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.095
Ask Scorsese.
Huh

06:02.095 --> 06:03.129
Hit me.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.065
I’ve got all the time
in the world.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.601
Yeah, mm, speaking of time,

06:07.601 --> 06:10.337
don’t we have a conference call
with the new deputy DA?

06:10.337 --> 06:11.371
Yeah, Avery had me

06:11.371 --> 06:13.373
walk him through how
to call the DA’s office.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.008
You know,
as an older millennial,

06:15.008 --> 06:16.509
I have a lot of things to say

06:16.509 --> 06:20.180
that people generally
want to hear, so...

06:22.616 --> 06:24.017
MURTAUGH:
Hey, Captain.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.153
Why don’t, uh, me and you
grab a beer today?

06:27.153 --> 06:28.722
I got, I got plans.
Ask Scorsese.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.223
COLE: Hey, Cap,
is that a new tie?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.325
You must really want to impress
the new deputy DA.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.095
Her mother is
Senator Donna Malick,

06:35.095 --> 06:36.896
which makes this call
very important

06:36.896 --> 06:38.531
to the political
career I almost had

06:38.531 --> 06:39.799
and may,
God willing,

06:39.799 --> 06:42.035
still have in
the future, so...

06:43.970 --> 06:45.238
Counselor Malick.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.040
Good morning.
Oh, crap.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.043
This is Detective Murtaugh
and... Where’d he...

06:50.043 --> 06:52.846
: I-I just met her.
Not in a good way.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.048
ERICA: Uh, you were
saying, Captain?

06:55.048 --> 06:57.250
You, Detective Murtaugh
and...?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.119
And-and my partner,
somewhere around.
Yes.

06:59.119 --> 07:02.355
He’s here.
Ah, well,
running behind myself.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.158
Fender bender.
Some moron hit my car.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.059
Moron?

07:06.059 --> 07:08.928
I am so sorry
to hear that.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.530
She stopped short.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.765
I’m sorry, is someone else

07:11.765 --> 07:13.933
in the office with you?
I’m-I’m hearing another voice.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.337
AVERY:
Difficulties.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.605
Echo.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.708
Well, I am building a case
against Tony Corsetti.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.842
Big fish.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.144
Yeah, my big fish.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.779
So you want us
to bring him in,

07:25.779 --> 07:26.980
give him a once

07:26.980 --> 07:28.682
The opposite.
You are to go nowhere

07:28.682 --> 07:32.485
near Corsetti. I just want you
to babysit my witness.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.587
Elliot Nunziata.

07:34.587 --> 07:37.090
Maître d’ at one
of Tony’s restaurants.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.292
Last night,
Tony tried to blow him up.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.860
He must’ve heard that he was

07:40.860 --> 07:42.395
gonna testify against his boss.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.563
So when do we start?

07:43.563 --> 07:44.464
Tonight. Pick him up at holding,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.833
and bring him to
the Beverly Regency.

07:46.833 --> 07:47.967
No can do.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.236
Tonight is no good.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.604
Oh, no.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.373
Please tell me you’re not...
His partner.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.309
Yeah, and tonight
I have plans.

07:56.309 --> 08:00.747
Oh, plans. Oh, why didn’t
you say so? Never mind then.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.615
Is she being sarcastic?

08:02.615 --> 08:04.918
Listen carefully.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.686
Until I get a warrant

08:06.686 --> 08:08.688
and Tony Corsetti is in custody,

08:08.688 --> 08:11.424
you two cannot leave
my witness’s side.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.427
Take Elliot to the hotel

08:14.427 --> 08:15.528
and stay with him.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.431
Oh, and another thing--
Detective Murtaugh drives.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.570
♪ ♪

08:26.439 --> 08:29.442
ELLIOT: When did America
stop serving real food?

08:29.442 --> 08:30.443
Look at this:

08:30.443 --> 08:32.312
avocado toast,

08:32.312 --> 08:34.647
quinoa pancakes.
I’m gonna call down there,

08:34.647 --> 08:37.250
ask them if they’ll whip me up
a shrimp cocktail. You want?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.285
I’m good.
What about your partner?

08:39.285 --> 08:40.920
They said you were
bringing a date.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.055
He’ll be here soon.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.723
He’s been having
car trouble.

08:43.723 --> 08:46.426
I’m being guarded
by two of L.A.’s finest.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.798
(sports announcer speaking
indistinctly)

08:51.798 --> 08:54.300
What the hell
is taking you so long?

08:54.300 --> 08:55.735
Ask him if he wants the shrimp.

08:55.735 --> 08:57.437
The shrimp.
COLE: Yeah,

08:57.437 --> 08:59.038
I’m not coming.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.475
Cole, the deputy DA put us both
on babysitting duty

09:02.475 --> 09:04.677
until she executes
the warrant for Tony.

09:04.677 --> 09:05.745
And that could take all night.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.981
Tony just opened up a tab
at Elliot’s restaurant.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.182
I figured I’d swing by there,

09:09.182 --> 09:10.517
wrap this baby up.
MURTAUGH: Yeah.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.252
Just in time to have
dinner with Natalie.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.121
Huh? Yeah, I guess
I could make that.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.256
Hadn’t even crossed my mind.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.959
Right. And what am
I supposed to do

09:19.959 --> 09:21.294
with Mr. Shrimp
Cocktail over here?

09:21.294 --> 09:22.429
COLE:
You said you wanted

09:22.429 --> 09:24.297
a boys’ night out,
so now you got it.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.698
Cole, I think
you need to...

09:25.698 --> 09:27.233
Hello

09:27.233 --> 09:28.601
Cole?

09:28.601 --> 09:30.937
Damn it.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.806
You know, forgive me
for overstepping,

09:32.806 --> 09:35.475
but I don’t care
for his behavior.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.843
Hanging up on you?

09:36.843 --> 09:38.111
It’s disrespectful.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.513
It’s disrespectful.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.514
Let me guess,

09:41.514 --> 09:43.950
the man is so wrapped up
in his own needs,

09:43.950 --> 09:45.418
he doesn’t care about yours.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.189
Yeah! You got all that
from a phone call?

09:49.189 --> 09:50.457
I’m in hospitality.

09:50.457 --> 09:53.660
Reading people is kind of
my raison d’etre.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.562
Raison d’etre.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.341
Oh, great.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.911
You know, in this light,
your bumper doesn’t look so bad.

10:11.911 --> 10:14.881
Aren’t you supposed to be
watching my witness?
Yeah.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.282
Two cops to watch
one guy, it seemed

10:16.282 --> 10:18.551
like a poor use
of resources.
Why are you here?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.019
Oh.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.187
It isn’t to arrest Tony,

10:21.187 --> 10:22.689
because you agreed
to wait for a warrant,

10:22.689 --> 10:25.124
and I know you don’t have
the warrant because I do.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.061
Oh, you think
I’m here on the case?
Yeah.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.896
No. No, I’m here
for the lasagna.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.564
I heard it’s epic.
But now that I’m here,

10:31.564 --> 10:33.366
you know, maybe
I could help you.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.268
I don’t need your help.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.336
And I’m here
to give you the help

10:36.336 --> 10:37.437
that you didn’t
even know you needed.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.874
Ugh! Just, please,
go back to the hotel.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.275
Don’t screw this up for me.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.611
Why do you assume I’m gonna
screw it up? We just met.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.045
Call it a hunch, huh?

10:50.016 --> 10:51.384
Stay here.
Okay.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.157
The guy is back there!

10:58.157 --> 10:59.626
He shot Lee!

11:03.563 --> 11:05.498
Whoa! Don’t shoot!

11:05.498 --> 11:06.633
He went that way.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.976
Give me your keys.
Give me your keys.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.344
What What?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.046
Someone shot your big fish.
Give me your keys now.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.081
Okay, well, I’m coming with.
No, you’re not. No, no.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.149
Let’s go.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.918
I said no.
Okay, let’s go.

11:24.918 --> 11:28.521
And I swear to God, if you put
one more scratch on my car,

11:28.521 --> 11:31.024
we are going to have
a very big problem.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.101
No, no, no, no...

11:42.101 --> 11:43.303
Oh!

11:46.940 --> 11:49.142
Okay, are you trying
to get us killed?
Yeah.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.077
I am, Erica. Why?
Is that a problem?

11:55.615 --> 11:57.116
Hold on, hold on.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.518
What do you mean,
you don’t like hockey?

11:58.518 --> 12:02.388
Well, I’m more of a basketball,
baseball, football,

12:02.388 --> 12:04.490
anything but hockey
kind of guy.

12:04.490 --> 12:07.060
You’ve just never
seen it live.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.495
I was a Ranger fan up until ’92.

12:09.495 --> 12:10.930
What happened in ’92?

12:10.930 --> 12:14.300
I sat next to Wayne Gretzky
on a flight from Dubuque.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.768
We got to chatting.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.570
Very, very nice guy.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.739
I got him a room upgrade
at the Peninsula.

12:19.739 --> 12:24.143
Next thing I know, I got season
tickets to the Kings for life.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.979
What?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.213
Never looked back.
You know what?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.548
You and me,
we should go sometime.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.884
Yeah.

12:31.884 --> 12:34.954
We interrupt this broadcast...
Oh, no. Oh, no.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.323
They’re gonna preempt the
game because of some moron

12:37.323 --> 12:38.992
in a convertible?

12:38.992 --> 12:41.094

but we caught
a bunch of small ones.

14:37.810 --> 14:38.945

Hey, hey, don’t you think
you’re being a bit harsh?

14:50.523 --> 14:53.259
I mean, Elliot means well.
Yeah.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.327
Means well?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.129
What, are you friends now?

14:56.129 --> 14:59.332
Guys, I got a great idea
in the shower.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.302
Ugh, oh, my God.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.505
Whoa. Did I smell that bad
when I came in?

15:05.505 --> 15:06.739
ERICA:
Why didn’t you let me

15:06.739 --> 15:08.741
shower first?
Because I have a date.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.643
And I needed it.
Now you need it.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.712
Okay, enough. All right.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.347
Someone tried to kill you.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.748
And they got Tony.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.216
Why

15:17.216 --> 15:20.720
If you know something,
Elliot, now’s the time.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.055
ELLIOT: Okay,
I may have heard--

15:23.055 --> 15:24.791
and you didn’t hear this
from me--

15:24.791 --> 15:26.225
that Tony

15:26.225 --> 15:30.096
and another guy maybe pulled
a little heist a week ago.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.230
How little?

15:31.230 --> 15:32.465
Two million.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.966
Armored truck,

15:33.966 --> 15:35.201
down in Long Beach.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.569
Who was with Tony?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.104
:
Oh.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.539
I need to know I’m protected.

15:39.539 --> 15:40.940
You have my word.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.378
What do you think, Rog?

15:45.378 --> 15:47.280
I would take the deal.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.949
Oof.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.251
Jimmy Doherty.
They call him Blinky.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.253
He’s an explosives
expert.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.955
And a great tipper, too,
by the way.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.757
I want to know
exactly where he is.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.993
Okay, but he’s a little jumpy,

16:00.993 --> 16:02.862
so I wouldn’t
sneak up on him.

16:02.862 --> 16:06.833
Consider that a warning.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.168
What, I’m-I’m not
with Elliot no more?

16:09.168 --> 16:11.737
The city’s done paying
for your guys’ night.

16:11.737 --> 16:12.872
Cole will babysit,

16:12.872 --> 16:14.740
and you’re on Mr. Blinky.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.948
ELLIOT:
Only two reasons for a guy

16:21.948 --> 16:23.482
to check his phone that much.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.918
A wager or a girl.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.254
And you don’t strike me
as being the gambler type.

16:28.254 --> 16:32.391
So, is she your ex,
or your next?

16:34.026 --> 16:35.161
Ex.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.964
Possible next.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.032
I don’t know.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.467
We were supposed
to talk about it tonight.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.536
And I take it
this can’t wait until tomorrow?

16:43.536 --> 16:46.138
No, I think her boyfriend’s
gonna propose tomorrow.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.474
Oh, well, then, let’s get her
over here tonight.

16:48.474 --> 16:49.575
Come on, kid.

16:49.575 --> 16:51.110
Step up. Adapt.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.479
Relationships
are about timing.

16:53.479 --> 16:56.315
And there’s no better time
than right now.

16:56.315 --> 16:59.018
No offense, Elliot, but I don’t
really want to win her back

16:59.018 --> 17:00.486
with you in the room.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.421
No, not here. Downstairs.

17:02.421 --> 17:03.823
They got
a beautiful bar.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.591
Music, wine.

17:05.591 --> 17:06.959
You set the mood,

17:06.959 --> 17:08.494
you open your heart.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.795
I love this.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.297
God.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.199
I like that.
Yeah?

17:13.199 --> 17:14.533
Okay.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.502
"Beverly Regency.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.970
"Lobby bar.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.805
How about now?"

17:20.740 --> 17:23.442
This, to the woman you love?

17:23.442 --> 17:24.443
Come on.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.078
Bleed a little. Open a vein.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.647
Yeah.
Show it to me.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.282
You got this, you got this.

17:29.282 --> 17:33.920
"I can’t stop thinking
about the kiss."

17:33.920 --> 17:37.156
That’s more like a paper cut,
but it’s okay for now.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.492
Sent.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.828
Elliot, thank you
for the advice.
You’re very welcome.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.297
I’m gonna need you
to stay right here.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.866
Well, how do you plan
on doing that?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.868
Show me your hands.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.411
Well, here we are.

17:58.411 --> 18:02.014
Just two old friends
walking and talking.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.849
Just like old times.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.551
Look, the only reason
I’m out here

18:05.551 --> 18:07.954
is because Cole was busy
and you needed backup.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.823
And I want Erica to tell her mom
I did a really good job.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.129
Hey.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.998
What do you think
that means?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.710
MAN:
Fire in the hole!

18:30.710 --> 18:33.913
You’re supposed to say that
before the explosion!

18:36.082 --> 18:37.683
Who the hell are you?

18:37.683 --> 18:39.885
LAPD. Robbery-Homicide.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.020
Oh.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.655
Thought you were here
to kill me.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.724
Come on in,
I guess.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.958
Stay on the path.

18:45.958 --> 18:50.096
If it looks like a landmine,
probably is.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.064
As you can see,

18:52.064 --> 18:53.699
I had an accident myself.

18:53.699 --> 18:56.002
So the name "Blinky" is...
Tony’s idea of a joke.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.070
Cracked him up.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.272
Even more reason
for you to kill him.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.910
You think I killed Tony? No way.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.278
We know about the heist.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.747
Two million.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.281
That’s pretty good motive.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.750
Kill him, keep it all
to yourself?

19:10.750 --> 19:13.285
You don’t know what you’re
talking about, Detective.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.154
We have a witness who ties you
to the robbery.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.822
Let’s not add homicide
to the equation.

19:16.822 --> 19:21.293
Even if I did pull the heist,
which I do not admit to,

19:21.293 --> 19:25.131
I know Tony stashed the money
at a neutral spot.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.465
And then it went missing.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.700
All two million.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.101
What neutral spot?

19:29.101 --> 19:31.504
The restaurant.
What’s it called?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.606
Miceli’s.
That’s the place.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.642
Tony called me the other day,
we had words.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.045
I’ve been hiding up here since.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.346
Who else could’ve
taken the money?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.248
Only guy with keys
to the kingdom.

19:42.248 --> 19:48.187
The maître d’. Elliot Nunziata.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.710
:
Oh, man.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.945
ELLIOT:
Hey, Cole, anything yet?

20:16.148 --> 20:17.750
Elliot, she’s not here.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.085
Maybe she changed her mind.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.686
Give her time. She’s coming.

20:20.686 --> 20:23.722
I don’t know.
I’m sweating bullets here.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.957
Hey, I got to

20:24.957 --> 20:26.125
put you on hold. One second.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.397
Hey, Roger.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.932
Cole, are you still with Elliot?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.467
Essentially.
That means no.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.435
Okay, look. Elliot is...
ERICA: Uh...

20:36.435 --> 20:37.937
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.305
Police work.

20:39.305 --> 20:42.508
Elliot lied.
He stole the money from Tony.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.543
He played us.
Just relax. Okay?

20:44.543 --> 20:46.412
I got Elliot
on video conference.

20:48.748 --> 20:49.715
Elliot’s gone.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.156
Son of a bitch.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.827
"Cole. Had to run. Good luck.
Hope you get the girl."

21:01.827 --> 21:04.163
I don’t think he’s
talking about you.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.203
Good. You’re here.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.571
I’ve been thinking
about the case, and I think

21:12.571 --> 21:15.207
that I know who helped
Elliot escape. Jill Brown.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.009
The waitress at his
restaurant, and she was at...

21:17.009 --> 21:18.778
At the hotel. Yeah. I know.

21:18.778 --> 21:22.114
You do?
Mm-hmm.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.450
Here, she walks
right past you

21:24.450 --> 21:26.652
while you’re eating
a breadstick.

21:26.652 --> 21:30.356
Wow, the resolution
on these surveillance cameras.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.490
It’s amazing.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.559
Now you turn, almost see her,

21:33.559 --> 21:36.128
and then you put
the breadstick back.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.098
In my defense,
the breadsticks were super dry.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.833
Well, the breadsticks
cost us the case.

21:40.833 --> 21:44.904
And Elliot and Jill are probably
halfway to Tahiti by now.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.842
This is not your fault.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.243
Does it matter?

21:51.243 --> 21:53.379
That’s what people will think,
the same way they think

21:53.379 --> 21:54.680
I’m only here
because of my mother.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.615
I don’t think that.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.084
Look, I’m gonna...

21:59.084 --> 22:00.686
I’m gonna get back
to this, okay?

22:00.686 --> 22:03.522
Yeah.
Okay.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.763
TRISH:
To girls’ night!

22:10.763 --> 22:13.265
ALL: Girls’ night!
TRISH: Yes, we love it.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.267
Honest talk!

22:15.267 --> 22:17.236
Okay, okay, your
turn, Trish.

22:17.236 --> 22:18.938
Give us the dirt
on Roger.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.406
Oh, gosh. Okay.
Got to be something.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.674
What can I say?

22:21.674 --> 22:23.409
He’s my best friend.

22:23.409 --> 22:24.543
I love the big guy,

22:24.543 --> 22:25.911
as you all know.

22:25.911 --> 22:28.914
But, um...
...sometimes

22:28.914 --> 22:30.916
I wish Roger...

22:33.319 --> 22:34.420
Hello?

22:34.420 --> 22:36.121
Someone there?

22:36.121 --> 22:37.556
Hello?

22:39.925 --> 22:41.260
Oh, hey.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.695
Good evening, ladies.

22:43.762 --> 22:46.198
Shana.
TRISH: Roger.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.399
You’re home.

22:47.399 --> 22:51.003
Well, don’t you
let me interrupt you.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.372
I’ll be upstairs,
quiet as a little church mouse.

22:57.576 --> 23:00.546
Okay, now, I know I told...
Uh, b-but, uh...

23:00.546 --> 23:02.248
wh-while I’m here,
why don’t you

23:02.248 --> 23:04.350
go ahead and finish saying
what you was, uh,

23:04.350 --> 23:05.918
just about to say?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.453
Roger.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.555
Why don’t we talk
about this later?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.657
You know,
"sometimes I wish Roger..."

23:15.628 --> 23:17.963
Oh! You wish he shaved
his goatee. You said that once.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.131
I didn’t.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.433
Uh, but no.
Can we not do that now?
SHANA: Didn’t you say

23:21.433 --> 23:24.737
it was funny for a grown man
to spend so much time in a tub?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.005
MURTAUGH:
You told Shana

23:26.005 --> 23:28.974
about tub time?
TRISH: Okay, baby.

23:28.974 --> 23:30.476
Maybe we should table this.
No.

23:30.476 --> 23:31.744
I want to know.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.045
I want to know right now.
Tell me.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.380
What were you going
to say? Come on.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.982
You want to do that now?
Right here and now?
Right here, yes.

23:36.982 --> 23:40.019
Right now. Sometimes Roger...
I wish Roger...
Oh, okay, Roger.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.787
Sometimes I wish you would
give me some space!

23:41.787 --> 23:42.922
Uh...

23:45.391 --> 23:48.627
Okay. Honey...

23:48.627 --> 23:50.896
listen, baby.

23:50.896 --> 23:53.299
You know I love spending time
with you.

23:53.299 --> 23:58.604
It’s just that maybe it would be
nice for the both of us if you

23:58.604 --> 24:00.773
expanded your world a bit.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.009
That’s...
I see.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.145
You need your space.

24:06.145 --> 24:09.548
Well, baby, now is a
good time to start.

24:09.548 --> 24:11.183
Roger...

24:13.385 --> 24:14.853
And, Marcy...

24:16.088 --> 24:17.423
It’s a Van Dyke.

24:17.423 --> 24:20.826
And it looks
spectacular.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.239
Natalie.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.909
Can I come in?
Yeah.

24:39.345 --> 24:41.613
You know, when you didn’t
show up at the hotel,

24:41.613 --> 24:43.015
I thought you got cold feet.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.016
Do you want a beer?

24:44.016 --> 24:46.318
No, Cole. I’m not staying.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.587
Is everything okay?
No.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.090
What is wrong with you?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.791
"I can’t stop thinking
about the kiss"?

24:52.791 --> 24:54.693
I thought you’d appreciate
a little romance.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.161
Yeah, well, Andrew didn’t.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.397
He saw the text.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.432
And he walked out.

25:00.432 --> 25:01.667
Said it’s over.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.002
I didn’t know
where else to go.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.707
You said before that
you were confused.

25:10.976 --> 25:13.145
Have things become more clear?

25:14.980 --> 25:16.281
Yeah.

25:16.281 --> 25:19.184
Never been more clear.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.254
Andrew is who I want.

25:22.254 --> 25:25.190
And because of you,
he’s gone.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.033
Nat, I get it.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.202
You’re upset.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.038
But you kissed me.

25:39.038 --> 25:39.872
I know.

25:39.872 --> 25:43.509
I know I did.
And it was a mistake.

25:43.509 --> 25:47.246
You know, you were
in trouble

25:47.246 --> 25:48.981
and it was just like
it used to be.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.150
And I got caught up in a moment.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.321
But it wasn’t real.

25:57.456 --> 25:59.691
It felt real to me.

26:01.260 --> 26:05.130
Cole, we have a daughter,

26:05.130 --> 26:06.932
and a past.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.103
But Andrew
was my future.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.071
He was real.

26:13.071 --> 26:16.975
And you did what you always do,
and you blew everything up.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.324
♪ ♪

26:34.693 --> 26:37.229
TRISH:
Roger, phone!

26:38.530 --> 26:40.299
I knew you were
in a bath.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.834
A call for you.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.902
And...
COLE: I don’t know,

26:43.902 --> 26:45.938
like, maybe I shouldn’t have
sent that text.

26:45.938 --> 26:46.905
Oh.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.407
I had to put myself
out there, right?

26:48.407 --> 26:51.977
Why is Cole sipping chardonnay
with your friends?

26:51.977 --> 26:55.214
Well, he came by looking for
a "deep dive" with you.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.082
But he found them.
SHANA: Sweetie,

26:57.082 --> 26:58.851
you did nothing wrong.
She kissed you.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.519
MURTAUGH:
Oh.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.588
So him you don’t
need space from?

27:02.588 --> 27:06.058
Okay. Apparently, things did not
go well with Natalie.

27:06.058 --> 27:09.194
And I think a female
perspective has been

27:09.194 --> 27:10.429
very cathartic.

27:10.429 --> 27:11.830
Now answer your phone.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.066
Yeah?
ELLIOT: Murtaugh.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.267
I’ve been thinking about you

27:15.267 --> 27:17.936
and I realize I never got to say
a proper good-bye.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.338
Elliot

27:19.338 --> 27:21.573
Hey, Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants.

27:21.573 --> 27:22.875
It’s Elliot.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.844
ELLIOT: Eh, who can say?
All island paradises

27:25.844 --> 27:28.680
:
are more or less the same.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.982
But listen, I want to apologize.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.518
I never intended
to get you boys in trouble.

27:32.518 --> 27:35.120
Oh, just like you didn’t intend
to steal $2 million.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.022
Cole! Hey, how’d it go
with the girl?

27:37.022 --> 27:38.824
Not good, Elliot.
Not good at all.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.359
The text you had me send sucked.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.994
MURTAUGH:
Hey,

27:41.994 --> 27:42.961
why’d you take the money,
Elliot?

27:42.961 --> 27:44.730
Crime of opportunity.

27:44.730 --> 27:47.266
I overheard Jimmy and Tony
one night.

27:47.266 --> 27:51.136
How they held up this
armored car full of cash,

27:51.136 --> 27:53.272
which belonged
to Stavos the Greek.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.474
They stuffed the loot
in the restaurant.

27:55.474 --> 27:57.009
What was I to do?

27:57.009 --> 27:59.444
Well, for starters,
not take the money.

27:59.444 --> 28:00.846
And not kill Tony.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.681
Hey, that wasn’t me.

28:02.681 --> 28:07.152
I might be a thief and a liar,
but I am not a killer.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.520
Great. Then turn yourself in.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.722
NEWSMAN: ...gridlocked
the 101 south

28:10.722 --> 28:12.758
from Hollywood Boulevard to...

28:12.758 --> 28:13.959
Listen, I got to roll.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.894
These piñas
won’t colada themselves.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.563
I’m glad I met you boys.

28:17.563 --> 28:22.734
In another life,
we might’ve been friends.

28:22.734 --> 28:23.769
Did you hear that?

28:23.769 --> 28:25.637
Yeah, the piña colada joke.

28:25.637 --> 28:26.905
It’s pretty funny.

28:26.905 --> 28:29.207
No, the TV in the background.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.810
Talking about traffic
on the 101.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.946
On his island paradise?

28:33.946 --> 28:35.914
Elliot’s still in town.
Yeah.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.789
So, Elliot hasn’t left town yet?

28:43.789 --> 28:46.858
Traffic cam caught him
entering a motel in downtown.

28:46.858 --> 28:48.060
Next to the Staples Center.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.295
We have round-the-clock
surveillance-- airports,
train stations.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.930
Good. Solid work, Captain.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.699
Remember that if your mom asks.
She won’t.

28:53.699 --> 28:56.068
Elliot said the
$2 million was stolen

28:56.068 --> 28:57.836
from a guy named
"Stavos the Greek."

28:57.836 --> 28:59.271
Fabrizio Stavos?

28:59.271 --> 29:01.106
So, that was his money

29:01.106 --> 29:02.808
in the armored car?
You know him?

29:02.808 --> 29:05.143
My office has been after him
for years.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.411
Drug trafficking,
money laundering.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.715
The guy has his fingers in every
criminal pot in town.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.283
But no one’s been able
to pin him.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.484
Sounds like this guy’s

29:12.484 --> 29:13.652
an even bigger fish
than Tony Corsetti.

29:13.652 --> 29:17.155
Stavos makes Tony
look like smelt.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.392
Smelt are very small fish.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.594
Why didn’t you
say minnow?
Koi.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.429
COLE: Goldfish.
AVERY: Tadpole.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.764
Tadpole’s not a fish.
It’s a frog.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.099
Well, no, but it’s-it’s
not a frog yet.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.034
It’s a frog. It’s always a frog.
It turns into a frog.

29:29.034 --> 29:30.736
Is it always a frog?
Yeah.

29:30.736 --> 29:34.072
Regardless, we better hope
that he’s not onto Elliot yet

29:34.072 --> 29:37.743
because a guy like Fabrizio
Stavos does not mess around.

29:37.743 --> 29:38.577
Come on.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.246

29:41.246 --> 29:42.948
How dangerous could he be?

29:42.948 --> 29:44.082
JIMMY:
Fabrizio.

29:44.082 --> 29:47.319
I appreciate you
bailing me out and all,

29:47.319 --> 29:49.421
but is-is this really...
necessary?

29:49.421 --> 29:50.689
I don’t...
Who took my money, Jimmy?

29:50.689 --> 29:51.556
Don’t know.

29:51.556 --> 29:54.192
But if I did,
I’d strangle them myself.

You know,
Tony’s guy at Miceli’s.

30:17.983 --> 30:21.420
You’re telling me the mook that
wouldn’t even sit me at my table

30:21.420 --> 30:23.555
has my $2 million?

30:23.555 --> 30:24.623
Mm-hmm.

30:24.623 --> 30:27.359
Where is Elliot now?

30:30.662 --> 30:33.031
Hey, Cole,
I should warn you.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.067
There’s a guy prowling the halls
looking for you

30:35.067 --> 30:36.635
and he’s pissed.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.737
There he is.
: That’s him.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.772
Do you want me to...?
The big man himself.

30:43.041 --> 30:46.244
Andrew, why don’t we go
someplace more private?

31:00.492 --> 31:02.394
Was this your plan all along?

31:02.394 --> 31:03.962
You play nice
with Maya,

31:03.962 --> 31:05.430
and then you swoop in
for the kill?

31:05.430 --> 31:06.531
You got every right to be angry.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.799
I don’t know what Natalie sees
in you.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.535
Is it your charm?
What, your muscles?

31:10.535 --> 31:12.838
That tattoo? What even--
what even is that, Cole?

31:12.838 --> 31:15.407
Andrew, I screwed up.
Stop agreeing with me!

31:15.407 --> 31:17.042
If you want to hit me, go ahead.
I deserve it.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.410
I’m not gonna hit you, Cole.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.679
It’s not who I am.

31:22.314 --> 31:25.217
Do you want to know the worst
part about this whole situation?

31:25.217 --> 31:26.985
I was gonna take her

31:26.985 --> 31:28.854
to the Kings playoff game
tonight and propose.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.257
That’s where we had
our first date.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.426

31:34.426 --> 31:35.694
You’re right.

great mom...

31:51.309 --> 31:52.711
but she loves you.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.912
Not me.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.752
How do I know that’s the truth?

32:02.487 --> 32:03.855
Because she told me.

for a mistake.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.594
Yep.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.096

he totally should’ve hit you.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.771

Well, at least
it wasn’t a total wash.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.978

Yeah. Didn’t you guys say
he was a huge Kings fan?
