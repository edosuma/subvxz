WEBVTT

00:02.635 --> 00:04.837
Honey?
Hey.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.439
Did you remember to give Alex
and Luke their lunch money?
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.341
What about the electrician?
Did you give him a check?

00:09.343 --> 00:10.843
He's an electrician...
He'll charge us.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.478
I'm gonna
be late for work, shecky.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.946
Yes, I paid him.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.114
Happy valentine's,
by the way.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.315
Mm, no.
Mm.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.549
Gross and sweaty
from running.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.552
So
For later tonight,

00:20.554 --> 00:22.488
You thinking
what I'm thinking, valentine?

00:22.490 --> 00:24.223
I believe I am.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.991
Every valentine's day,

00:25.993 --> 00:28.360
Claire and I look forward
to some naughty role-playing...

00:28.362 --> 00:31.463
Sexually adventurous cuckolder
juliana

00:31.465 --> 00:32.898
And clive bixby,

00:32.900 --> 00:35.501
Speaker salesman by day,
spy by night.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.036
Lover also by night

00:37.038 --> 00:39.338
And sometimes
during the day.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.508
The speaker business, it...
It pretty much runs itself.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.376
I just want to keep it
really low-key this year.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.878
You know, simple.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.179
Yep.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.014
On the other hand,

00:49.016 --> 00:51.016
We could have a drink
at that hotel bar we love.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.551
Go on.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.553
And come straight home...

00:54.555 --> 00:55.888
Put on our jammies,

00:55.890 --> 00:57.689
And fall asleep
in front of the tv.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.991
Perfect.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.559
Looking forward to it
already.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.494
Ew, but not
those ones I hate,

01:02.496 --> 01:03.762
Those red satin pajamas.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.397
I don't even know
where those are.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.400
...Captions by <b> <i>vitac</i> </b>...

01:08.402 --> 01:11.503
¶¶¶

01:18.912 --> 01:20.512
I know
I'll get over it,

01:20.514 --> 01:23.015
But right now
I hate anders and cooper.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.684
Our dear friends
anders and cooper

01:25.686 --> 01:27.386
Got married
last valentine's day,

01:27.388 --> 01:29.521
And we wanted to get them
something really special.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.124
We found this exquisite
little painting...
Oh...

01:32.126 --> 01:35.360
...Of a winery in napa
that we all visited last year.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.362
It was a... Bit pricey,

01:37.364 --> 01:39.631
But they're really judge-y
and we knew they'd love it.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.366
The problem is,
so did we.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.535
Thank you,
carmelina.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.238
Oh, and here's
s-something you can...

01:46.240 --> 01:47.606
Put in the other room.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.075
That was hard.
So hard.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.944
Probably how
Lily's birth mother felt.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.079
Except we don't have
nine other paintings by
five different painters.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.314
Oh, my god.
Mitch, Cam.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.615
Oh, god,
are we early?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.217
This is so
not like us.
I'm sorry.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.219
No, no, no.
The party's been canceled.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.954
Why?
Cooper's left me.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.422
He's filing
for divorce.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.756
The marriage is over!

02:04.758 --> 02:05.591
Ohh.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.558
Ohh.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.460
Ohh, anders.
Anders.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.130
I thought
we were in love.
Mm.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.866
You think you know
the person sleeping
in the next bedroom.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.935
I'll get us
some drinks.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.172
So sad.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.340
Yeah, it doesn't
have to be.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.075
If it's really love,

02:23.077 --> 02:25.010
You do everything you need to do
to get back what you once had.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.645
You're talking
about the painting, right?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.280
Of course I am 'cause we
don't owe him that anymore.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.281
Go get it!
Okay.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.349
Go get it.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.917
You must have
big plans today.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.619
This is like
your super bowl, right?

02:33.621 --> 02:35.187
I'm sitting it out
this year.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.356
The whole holiday's
gotten laughably commercial.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.924
Sounds like
amy turned you down.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.193
Like a bed
in a five-star hotel.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.761
I'll be
drowning my sorrows

02:42.763 --> 02:44.796
In a marathon of my
new favorite true-crime show,

02:44.798 --> 02:46.331
"lethal ladies."

02:46.333 --> 02:48.033
Amy may have dumped me,

02:48.035 --> 02:50.269
But at least it wasn't
off the lido deck of
a carnival cruise.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.437
- I know, sonia!
<i>- Cállate!</i>

02:52.439 --> 02:55.107
Look who's back...
The sangria sisters.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.441
I invited
my sister to visit

02:56.443 --> 02:58.110
So that we could fix
our problems.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.012
You know, sister things,

03:00.014 --> 03:03.115
Like I never liked
how she always borrowed my bras,

03:03.117 --> 03:04.716
Or she never liked

03:04.718 --> 03:07.286
How I stole her one chance
to escape the village

03:07.288 --> 03:09.688
And I left her there,
taking care of my mother.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.156
Things like that.

03:11.158 --> 03:14.059
Jay, they delayed
sonia's flight until tomorrow.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.195
Why don't we cancel
our dinner reservation

03:16.197 --> 03:18.397
And the three of us
celebrate valentine's here?

03:18.399 --> 03:20.699
You don't have to do that
for me, Gloria.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.568
I usually
spend valentine's day

03:22.570 --> 03:24.570
Selling artificial flowers
near the well in my village.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.206
Where do you people live,
national geographic?

03:27.208 --> 03:28.807
I just feel so bad.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.742
You have both shown me
such kindness this week,

03:30.744 --> 03:32.511
And I repay you
with bad weather over tampa.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.845
No, this is better.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.147
It gets crazy
out there.

03:35.149 --> 03:37.516
I'm happy
to avoid the fuss.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.918
Wouldn't have minded
a little fuss.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.055
Maybe I've been kind of feeling
taken for granted lately.

03:43.057 --> 03:46.425
I know only girls are
supposed to care about
valentine's day, but...

03:46.427 --> 03:47.759
Ah, what am I crying about?

03:47.761 --> 03:50.395
We get paid more,
so what the hell?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.331
Cooper didn't even
have the decency

03:52.333 --> 03:54.399
To leave me in time
to cancel the caterer.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.069
I have 300 of these wasabi
shrimp canapés if you're hungry.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.503
Oh, no, thank you.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.172
Sardine rillettes,
olive crostini...

04:00.174 --> 04:01.740
What am I supposed to do
with all of this?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.075
Carmelina,
that's for company.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.245
Oh, well, there's Cam,
so we should probably go.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.614
Oh, you were gone so long,
I was afraid you'd woken mother.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.715
Uh, m-mother?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.283
Didn't I mention it?

04:11.285 --> 04:13.418
She's recuperating here,
just had both hips replaced.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.953
Ohh.
Ohh.
Oh, that
reminds me...

04:14.955 --> 04:16.855
I should put on
the security Camera in her room.

04:16.857 --> 04:17.856
Did you get it?
Yes.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.291
And guess whose room

04:19.293 --> 04:20.759
They keep the last minute
wedding gifts in?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.894
Hint... apparently
you need your original hips

04:22.896 --> 04:24.229
To keep
a nightgown closed.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.098
Well, I'm glad
you stopped by.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.299
I really needed this.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.534
Oh, Cam,
get in here.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.036
Oh, I have
a little bit of a sniffle.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.738
Oh, come on.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.072
Oh!

04:34.074 --> 04:35.040
What's this?
Um...

04:35.042 --> 04:36.708
Uh, that is, um...

04:36.710 --> 04:38.443
That's a wedding gift
for you and cooper,

04:38.445 --> 04:40.412
But once we heard, we didn't
think it was appropriate.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.314
Oh, are you kidding?
There's no bad time for a gift.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.582
I'm... I'm sorry
it's so late.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.883
We just wanted
to get you something

04:44.885 --> 04:46.285
That you would
really cherish.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.953
Pretty much the best gift
we've ever given anyone.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.288
Yeah, it's...
It's a beautiful...

04:49.290 --> 04:51.990
Cheese plate!

04:51.992 --> 04:53.892
Yes, I got that
from the...

04:53.894 --> 04:55.093
Whimsical phrasing.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.428
Are you sure
you won't stay for one more,

04:56.430 --> 04:57.929
Especially now
since I've got this

04:57.931 --> 04:59.831
Stylish
cheese-delivery system?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.300
Just one, yeah.
Great.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.467
Okay.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.437
What happened?!

05:05.439 --> 05:07.272
Obviously there were
two gifts wrapped similarly,

05:07.274 --> 05:08.573
And my eyes
were watering

05:08.575 --> 05:10.242
From the think fog
of vaporub back there.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.510
Okay, well, we got
nothing to lose now,

05:11.512 --> 05:12.844
So go back
and get the painting.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.513
You know who gave him
that cheap thing?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.114
J'marcus. She's got the
first dollar she ever earned...

05:16.116 --> 05:17.649
Just go!

05:17.651 --> 05:19.751
Once sonia blew up
my valentine's day,

05:19.753 --> 05:22.087
I could have sat around
feeling sorry for myself.

05:22.089 --> 05:25.691
Instead, I had a little chuckle,
and I got the dog a gift.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.460
I know it's silly
getting Stella a present...

05:28.462 --> 05:30.662
So close
to her birthday.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.264
Is she around?

05:32.266 --> 05:33.865
I think she's upstairs
in the bath.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.267
What? I just gave her
a bath this morning.

05:35.269 --> 05:36.435
Ew!

05:36.437 --> 05:37.769
Oh, you're talking
about Stella.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.371
Wait, you
got the dog a gift?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.972
Lot of attitude

05:40.974 --> 05:42.974
For a guy whose date's a tub
of ice cream and a fuzzy robe.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.243
You're spending valentine's day
in a "cathy" cartoon.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.180
Hey, what's all this?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.815
I thought the three
of us were just gonna
order something in.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.850
No.
I ruined your night enough.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.452
I'm cooking
for you and Gloria

05:53.454 --> 05:55.887
So you can have
a romantic evening alone.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.123
Sonia, you don't
have to do this.
I want to.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.792
It makes me so happy
to prepare food for you.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.062
Maybe someday I'll be preparing
it for a husband of my own.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.198
Thank you for not laughing
and falling on the floor

06:06.200 --> 06:08.600
Like my mother does
when I say such things.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.570
You know, it being
valentine's day and all,

06:11.572 --> 06:13.505
I, uh...

06:13.507 --> 06:14.973
I got you
a little something.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.074
Ooh, laundry?

06:16.076 --> 06:17.008
No.

06:17.010 --> 06:17.909
Here.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.646
I can't.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.981
Come on!
Open it.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.084
Here, see
that "s" there?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.819
That's for "sonia."

06:31.257 --> 06:34.526
Oh, Jay,
it's so beautiful.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.261
I don't know
what to...

06:36.263 --> 06:37.329
Thank you!

06:41.701 --> 06:42.868
When will I learn?

06:42.870 --> 06:45.203
I'm catnip
to sister-in-laws.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.406
Years ago, I was sitting
next to dede's sister cece

06:47.408 --> 06:48.740
At thanksgiving dinner,

06:48.742 --> 06:50.776
And I threw
a little charm her way.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.244
You know,
flash the baby blues.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.745
And before I know it,

06:53.747 --> 06:56.114
She's rubbing her size 12s
up and down my shin.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.550
Dede caught her,
went over the table at her.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.820
It took me and her sister bebe
to separate them.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.591
Hey, where are you?

07:06.593 --> 07:07.893
I've been trying you
for 15 minutes.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.694
I know.
We ran late.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.530
And then the car wouldn't start,
so I had to call aaa.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.532
They said they're on their way,
but who knows?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.066
I'm all greasy.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.602
Oh, honey, I don't think
I'm gonna make it. Don't be mad.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.037
I am mad.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.439
You were supposed to be here
20 minutes ago.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.073
This is the one night
we set aside for us.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.742
I know,
and I feel terrible,

07:23.744 --> 07:26.912
But listen,
finish your drink, come on home.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.880
Maybe we'll have
a romantic easter.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.217
Check, please.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.922
I understand that your wife
has had some car trouble.

07:36.924 --> 07:40.125
I wonder how that
could have happened?

07:48.568 --> 07:50.302
I must say, juliana,

07:50.304 --> 07:52.237
You're the last person I
expected to see here tonight.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.439
Well, with any luck,
you'll be the last person
I <i> do</i> see tonight.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.941
Oh, my god.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.343
Phil, I've had my eye on you
for years.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.644
I'm just so happy

07:59.646 --> 08:01.680
We're finally gonna get
some alone time.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.014
I'm not scaring you,
am I?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.749
Quite the contrary.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.084
Most women who meet me

08:06.086 --> 08:07.953
Almost instantly
ask for some alone time.

08:07.955 --> 08:08.753
Mm.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.121
Excuse me.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.523
Darn it!

08:11.525 --> 08:12.991
My showing was pushed up
tomorrow morning.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.026
I-I may have to make it
an early one.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.628
Are you sure?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.663
'Cause you only have
one night with me, tiger,

08:18.665 --> 08:20.031
And I'm as flexible

08:20.033 --> 08:21.700
As a government-insured,
zero-down,

08:21.702 --> 08:23.668
Variable-rate mortgage.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.337
Who are you?

08:25.339 --> 08:27.806
What do you say
we get out of here?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.107
What are you doing?
Run, run!

08:29.109 --> 08:30.375
But we haven't
even paid for this.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.376
We're outlaws, baby.
Go, go!

08:33.479 --> 08:35.813
That was such a rush!
Ah!

08:35.816 --> 08:38.116
You've never
stolen anything before?

08:38.118 --> 08:40.318
Only the entire show
of my high-school
production of "the wiz,"

08:40.320 --> 08:41.785
But I don't think
that's...

08:41.788 --> 08:44.689
Oh, glass elevator. Should
make for an exciting view.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.658
It will for
the people on the street.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.893
Oh, my god.

08:51.564 --> 08:52.998
I didn't even
hear them get on.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.300
Well, maybe it's time
for an ear cleaning.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.369
I don't know, you just
sluiced them out pretty good.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.170
I'm getting
kind of hot, Phil.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.740
What do you say
we cool off a bit?

09:01.742 --> 09:03.975
Aw, that would have
been great, juliana.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.677
Too bad
it's after... Dark.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.879
Sorceress.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.414
You were right,
juliana.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.850
This cool night air
is just the thing.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.652
Would the lady
like my coat

09:13.654 --> 09:14.920
So she doesn't
catch a col...

09:16.355 --> 09:17.822
Does that mean
what I think it does?

09:21.027 --> 09:22.661
Water's a little chilly.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.362
Think you can come in here
and help me warm it up?

09:24.364 --> 09:27.165
Baby, they haven't built a pool
I couldn't warm a little.

09:30.202 --> 09:31.903
Where's Cam?
Uh, tinkling again.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.438
Nature calls so often, I think
she has him on speed dial.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.074
Oh, what's that?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.709
The motion-detector alarm
in mother's room

09:37.711 --> 09:38.843
In case she
falls out of bed.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.579
I turn it on
during cocktails,

09:40.581 --> 09:42.514
When I tend to forget
she's even there.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.449
What's going on?
She all right?
Oh.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.917
Yeah, yeah, she's just
tossing her leg a little bit.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.686
Oh, that
kicky thing?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.187
She's either having
her rockettes dream

09:49.189 --> 09:50.689
Or her catheter's out.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.023
She's fine.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.226
Oh, we're out of ice!

09:55.228 --> 09:57.262
The nightmare continues!

09:58.297 --> 09:59.931
God.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.202
Oh.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.470
Hey, I got it.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.905
Okay, put it back.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.473
I can't possibly
have heard you correctly.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.742
There is a box over there
with a santangelo glass bowl

10:10.744 --> 10:12.377
That they got us
for our wedding.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.312
We'll just say that the
cheese plate was a little joke

10:14.314 --> 10:16.214
And that the real present
is in the other room.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.315
Hurry!

10:18.250 --> 10:19.751
You know,
your coming around today

10:19.753 --> 10:22.287
Reminded me that cooper and I
got you a wedding gift.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.655
You did?

10:23.657 --> 10:26.591
Well, now, this is a surprise.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.460
Well, even though
it doesn't say so on it,

10:28.462 --> 10:30.495
It's a fish!
Congrats.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.465
Oh, my god!
Plastic olive swords?

10:33.467 --> 10:36.301
Carmelina, are you trying
to be deported?!

10:36.303 --> 10:37.736
All right,
I got it back.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.070
What is that?

10:39.072 --> 10:40.639
This is anders'
wedding present to us.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.440
He must have
swapped it out

10:42.442 --> 10:44.175
When he opened that monstrosity
that he thinks we got him.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.477
We're getting
our painting back.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.679
Go.
Me?

10:47.681 --> 10:50.115
No, no. You've already
done a recon of the room.
<i>You</i> need to do this.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.483
Okay, take it easy,
"mission impossible."

10:51.485 --> 10:53.018
It's a bed and a couch,
not a laser maze.

10:53.020 --> 10:53.918
Now get.

10:55.956 --> 10:59.257
A little champagne, and dinner
will be ready in 10 minutes.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.625
Ay, gracias!

11:00.627 --> 11:03.595
Oh, Jay, thank you so much
for my new bracelet.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.096
You shouldn't have.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.798
And speaking of jewelry
and "shouldn't haves,"

11:06.800 --> 11:08.333
I was feeling sorry
for sonia,

11:08.335 --> 11:09.868
And I gave her
a little trinket.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.302
Oh, that's so sweet.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.605
Yeah, but now the poor kid's
got the hots for me.

11:13.607 --> 11:14.806
I don't know
what it is.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.141
Maybe I just don't know
my own power.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.609
I mean, you must
get that sometimes.

11:17.611 --> 11:18.443
Don't be mad.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.979
And don't be
whatever that is, either.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.114
She hugged me
and wouldn't let go.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.282
Mm.
It's not that crazy.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.717
This has happened
before.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.218
Oh, yeah, that time

11:27.220 --> 11:29.187
When dede's lonely sister
grabbed your leg?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.955
Not lonely.
She's a forest ranger.
Mm.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.457
She can't be
tied down.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.959
Look, before I shuffle back
to my bell tower,

11:34.961 --> 11:36.695
Let me just say
I know the look.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.463
Ay, Jay, please.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.332
I'm so sorry that I
didn't pay attention
to you at all today.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.501
And now you're all crazy.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.337
Gloria, I can't find
the candlesticks!

11:46.339 --> 11:48.640
Ay, don't worry.
I go help you!

11:50.142 --> 11:51.810
Ay!

11:51.812 --> 11:53.144
Gloria,
are you all right?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.412
My ankle!

11:54.414 --> 11:56.748
Why is Joe's toy here?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.817
Oh, gee,
you really twisted it, huh?
Ay, ay, ay, ay!

11:58.819 --> 12:00.418
All right, honey.
Let me get some ice on that.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.021
I heard a crash.
Is everything okay?

12:03.023 --> 12:04.656
Yeah, Gloria
turned her ankle.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.891
I don't know if she's gonna
make it down for dinner.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.893
Oh, no!

12:08.895 --> 12:10.261
Should I
bring your food upstairs?

12:10.263 --> 12:11.863
No, she just
wants to rest.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.998
She told me
to eat with you downstairs.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.600
She doesn't want
to make any...

12:16.869 --> 12:18.403
...Trouble.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.738
That was the most exciting night
of my life.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.507
Would it break the mood
if I clapped a little?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.008
No, I will allow it.

12:27.847 --> 12:30.048
Ooh, look,
they have the good q-tips.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.583
I'm gonna
steal us a bunch.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.084
I'm gonna miss juliana.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.053
That lady knows
where the bodies are buried.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.721
Oh, thanks, honey.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.557
I know some years I miss
the mark on valentine's day.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.359
This year,
I wanted to make sure...

12:41.361 --> 12:43.595
She's just
so adventurous and surprising.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.196
It's like
I was parched,

12:45.198 --> 12:47.132
And she quenched my thirst
with a big goblet of "wow."

12:47.134 --> 12:50.034
Hmm. Well, we'll have
to make sure your goblet
doesn't get so low

12:50.036 --> 12:52.070
Before we
fill her up again.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.539
I don't know what that means,
but anyway,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.875
I'm kind of thinking
maybe we'll just go home.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.477
That showing really is early,
and I need to be sharp.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.579
Are you sure? I thought
you wanted to sleep here.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.915
Yeah, I got caught up
in the whole juliana moment.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.251
Hey, would you see if
there's any sewing kits?
I think we're out.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.086
Yeah.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.487
Something was off,

13:09.489 --> 13:11.222
But I couldn't quite
put my finger on it.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.991
Claire,
let's get a move on!

13:12.993 --> 13:14.392
I'm coming.
I'm coming. Hang on.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.094
Well, look who's back.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.896
Oh. Yeah, well,
I would have changed,

13:17.898 --> 13:19.564
But this is
all I brought.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.499
Change?
When you're perfect?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.835
Oh, that's so nice.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.571
Oh, my, god, look at
that. It really has
gotten late, hasn't it?

13:26.573 --> 13:29.641
Not for a lady of the evening
like yourself, juliana.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.443
What's say we fog up
that glass elevator again

13:32.445 --> 13:34.412
And grab a nightcap
in the bar?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.483
Then I put my finger on it...

13:38.485 --> 13:39.851
My husband's in love
with another woman.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.326
You like that,
don't you?
Mmm, yeah.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.460
Poor Gloria,
though, huh?

13:49.462 --> 13:50.595
She'll be fine.

13:52.431 --> 13:53.498
Oh, you have
a little something...

13:53.500 --> 13:54.465
Oh, I'll get it
this time.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.569
Oh, excuse me.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.243
Oh, the soup is ready.
I'll bring some for Gloria.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.048
I'm not crazy, right?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.983
No. She's into you.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.618
Thank god you wandered down here
when you did.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.054
You see how she keeps
sliding close to me?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.722
It's like
eating on a boat.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.357
It's so much worse
than that.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.059
It's straight out of
"lethal ladies."

14:21.061 --> 14:23.394
Look what I found
in the trash.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.630
Pictures of me and Gloria
with Gloria's head cut out?

14:25.632 --> 14:27.298
She literally
wants mom out of the picture.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.366
Hold on, amigo.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.535
Is she infatuated with me?
Yes.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.904
Understandable,
unavoidable.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.006
But would she actually
do something to her own...

14:35.008 --> 14:36.674
what?!

14:36.676 --> 14:38.042
She just took a bottle
out of her purse

14:38.044 --> 14:39.644
And sprinkled it
into mom's soup.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.814
Okay, that's enough
of this dumb tv show for you.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.916
We're talking about a
perfectly believable obsession.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.018
You're trying to make this
into something that's...

14:47.020 --> 14:48.253
Here, Manny.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.588
That's for me?
What about Jay?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.323
Oh, it's too spicy
for him.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.092
I make another one just
like yours for your mother.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.894
Eat it while it's hot.
Okay.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.229
Oh, my god.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.064
She wants me
out of the picture, too.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.432
Of course.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.600
Young woman
meets a wealthy, older man.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.202
Who wants a kid
in the way?

15:04.204 --> 15:05.670
That's the first airtight thing
you've said today.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.005
But she's not
a murderer

15:07.007 --> 15:08.039
oh!
Oh!

15:08.041 --> 15:09.574
Stella, no!

15:09.576 --> 15:10.842
Oh, that's nice.
You'd let <i> me</i> eat the soup.

15:10.844 --> 15:12.010
Just clean it up.

15:13.379 --> 15:14.779
Open your eyes, Jay.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.247
She wants you
all to herself.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.782
The red dress
just like mom's,

15:17.784 --> 15:19.717
The toy she knew
mom would trip on,

15:19.719 --> 15:20.919
The headless pictures?

15:20.921 --> 15:22.186
She's crazy!

15:23.455 --> 15:24.822
You think I'm crazy?

15:26.292 --> 15:28.526
This is what I did
with the pictures.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.628
I made this valentine
for Gloria.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.631
The dress
I borrowed from Gloria

15:33.633 --> 15:35.700
To go with
your pretty necklace.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.136
And the "poison"
is guasca,

15:38.138 --> 15:40.171
A spice I brought
from colombia.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.607
And there's Stella
with the toy.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.542
Which she leaves
all over the house.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.444
There's been some
misunderstanding here,

15:46.446 --> 15:47.912
But it would be so super

15:47.914 --> 15:49.647
If you just
wouldn't mention this to...

15:49.649 --> 15:51.115
Me?!
Geez!

15:51.117 --> 15:53.318
As loud as these two are,
the move like cats.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.486
I heard everything
on the baby monitor.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.722
How can you say these things
about my sister?

15:57.724 --> 16:00.391
I was just trying
to be nice, Jay.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.827
I will call a cab
and wait at the airport.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.830
Now I know what your family
really thinks of me.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.298
Sonia, wait!
Ay!

16:08.902 --> 16:11.436
I have been working on fixing
my relationship with sonia

16:11.438 --> 16:12.770
The whole week,

16:12.772 --> 16:14.973
And because you think
you're a sex machine,

16:14.975 --> 16:16.441
You have
ruined everything.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.910
I'm sorry.
I'll talk to her.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.482
Sonia, I'm an idiot.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.652
I jumped to some
crazy conclusions today.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.654
I mean, I could say
it's because of valentine's

16:29.656 --> 16:30.855
Or, I don't know,

16:30.857 --> 16:33.157
Me feeling
a little neglected,

16:33.159 --> 16:34.525
But I know
you could never...

16:34.527 --> 16:35.927
Kiss me.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.528
Yes, because you're my
sister-in-law and, uh...

16:39.498 --> 16:40.765
We hid it
perfectly, Jay!

16:40.767 --> 16:41.666
Sonia, wait!

16:41.668 --> 16:43.201
We've waited
long enough!

16:43.203 --> 16:45.169
One night with me,
and you'll forget all about her.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.804
She doesn't
appreciate you.

16:46.806 --> 16:47.939
I hear how you fight!

16:47.941 --> 16:49.140
That's just
how we talk.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.009
Give in to it, Jay.
We both...

16:51.877 --> 16:53.144
Oh, no.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.979
Aah!

16:54.981 --> 16:57.615
I knew it!

16:57.617 --> 17:00.351
How dare do you try
to steal the life

17:00.353 --> 17:01.652
That I stole
from you?!

17:01.654 --> 17:02.954
Let him go, Gloria!
I love him!

17:02.956 --> 17:04.188
Never!

17:04.190 --> 17:06.290
He's my husband,
and I love him more!

17:06.291 --> 17:09.027
Ladies, ladies, stop.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.032
W-who are you?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.300
I-I-I'm a friend
of you son's.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.837
Oh, thank goodness.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.240
I twisted my neck,
and I need my pillow.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.508
I'm in agony.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.211
Yes, mother moving in
was inconvenient,

17:27.213 --> 17:29.347
But what did he want me to do,
just get rid of her?

17:29.349 --> 17:30.548
Who does that?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.650
I mean, a ghoul,
that's who.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.720
Oh, no!
What's wrong?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.155
Um

17:37.157 --> 17:38.856
Uh... oh, nothing. I was
just reliving the moment

17:38.858 --> 17:40.591
You told us about you
and cooper. Aww.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.360
You're so dear.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.930
You know that... that fish
I gave you and Mitchell?

17:45.932 --> 17:48.266
That really wasn't the gift
we picked out for you.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.101
Really?
No, I was just
being mean.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.770
Ohh.
It's just that, when I saw
that cheese plate, I just...

17:52.772 --> 17:54.272
Wait a minute.
Did...

17:54.274 --> 17:56.340
Did you give us that
because cooper and I

17:56.342 --> 17:59.077
Talked about opening up
a little cheese shop?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.545
Yes!
Why else?

18:00.547 --> 18:02.113
How sweet!

18:02.115 --> 18:04.082
Carmelina's probably
halfway home with it,

18:04.084 --> 18:06.451
But I can make her
walk back.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.720
And this...

18:09.722 --> 18:11.255
this is for you.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.291
We really
were so happy for you.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.059
Oh, anders.

18:15.061 --> 18:18.096
Well, we should probably get
going, but look who is up.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.764
Oh!
Mother,
where's your hat?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.400
Oh.
Look, anders
gave us the bowl after all.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.035
It's a good thing you
couldn't get the painting.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.103
We couldn't
take it now.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.871
Well, enjoy the bowl.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.840
It's about time you boys had
something pretty in the house.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.442
Ow.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.443
Oh, you're fine.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.011
I love you.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.716
Your husband's
noticing another woman,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.585
There's only one thing
to do...

18:40.587 --> 18:42.253
Step up your game.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.988
I just can't wait
to get in a hot bath

18:43.990 --> 18:45.823
And soak
this infected toenail.

18:47.092 --> 18:49.327
It's much easier just to
take the other bitch down.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.997
Well, I-I like
the sound of that bath.

18:52.999 --> 18:56.734
I assume the tub will be ringed
with scented candles?

18:56.736 --> 18:59.770
Oh, well, I've got candles.
I got candles everywhere.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.907
Ever since my boyfriend
stopped paying my bills,

19:02.909 --> 19:04.842
They turned off
the electricity.

19:06.778 --> 19:09.814
Leaving us to generate
our own electricity.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.283
Although, candles
can be nice

19:12.285 --> 19:15.119
If you're in the mood for,
say, some dirty dancing.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.254
Oh, I hate that movie.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.321
What?!

19:18.423 --> 19:20.024
There I must
passionately disagree.
Huh.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.293
Or was that your game
all along?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.363
Okay, if it's an argument
you want, fine.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.764
Fine!

19:26.766 --> 19:28.766
Of course johnny's
gonna fall for baby

19:28.768 --> 19:30.601
Because he's this big, dreamy
country bumpkin

19:30.603 --> 19:32.503
And she is
the shiny, new thing.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.672
But what happens
when the movie is over,

19:34.674 --> 19:37.208
When he really
gets to know her, huh?

19:37.210 --> 19:38.876
Two weeks out of
the catskills, and it's,

19:38.878 --> 19:40.178
"you wearing that again,
baby?

19:40.180 --> 19:41.946
"You borrow
my razor again, baby?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.482
Isn't two glasses
enough, baby?"

19:44.484 --> 19:47.919
Trust me, he is no longer
having the time of his life.

19:49.154 --> 19:50.821
Juliana.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.290
Juliana, wait.
No.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.725
Honestly, it is
one minute to 12:00, Phil.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.993
Valentine's day is over.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.662
Not quite.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.798
I can't
see you anymore.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.166
What?

20:02.168 --> 20:04.202
I can't believe
I'm saying this

20:04.204 --> 20:06.370
Because you're the most
intoxicating woman a
man could ever meet.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.906
But, by some
cosmic miracle,

20:08.908 --> 20:10.408
There's a woman
in that house

20:10.410 --> 20:12.143
That I still find
as sexy and exciting

20:12.145 --> 20:14.845
As the first day
I met her.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.582
I should probably let her know
that more often than I do.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.683
That's my bad.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.418
But, point is,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.820
A guy like me gets that lucky,
he quits while he's ahead.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.190
Well...

20:26.192 --> 20:28.326
It sounds to me
like she's the lucky one.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.329
Goodbye, juliana.

20:33.198 --> 20:34.265
Where are you going?

20:34.267 --> 20:35.499
Sorry.
Aren't... aren't we...

20:35.501 --> 20:36.601
Don't... don't beg.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.602
It's beneath you.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.103
Um, but I...

20:39.105 --> 20:41.172
Please, go.
My wife will see you.

20:42.374 --> 20:43.674
Go?
Go where?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.509
Don't make this harder
than it is.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.313
Okay.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.017
Juliana, no.

20:53.019 --> 20:53.951
Phil!

20:55.354 --> 20:56.087
Phil!

20:56.089 --> 20:57.054
Really?!

20:57.056 --> 20:58.289
Aah!

21:03.962 --> 21:06.397
¶ Best valentine's day ever ¶

21:06.399 --> 21:09.634
¶ best valentine's day ever ¶

21:21.246 --> 21:23.214
You know, I don't know
why you're so happy.

21:23.216 --> 21:26.083
I have tried the santangelo
in six different places,

21:26.085 --> 21:28.786
And it just makes me hate
everything in our house.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.754
We're moving.

21:29.756 --> 21:30.655
We're moving.
