WEBVTT

00:13.639 --> 00:14.973
Whoa.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.684
So, that was weird.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.229
Yeah. Wait.
Why did you think that was weird?

00:20.312 --> 00:22.564
You know, you and me together, weird.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.359
So it's not because
I did that talking penis thing, right?

00:25.442 --> 00:28.362
Just the general concept of us
sleeping together that's weird, right?

00:28.445 --> 00:29.363
Yeah.

00:29.446 --> 00:35.244
<i>Good morning, Hollywood.</i>
<i>It's a beautiful morning in sunny 2007.</i>

00:35.327 --> 00:38.705
Oh, my God, 2007?
Is that what time it is?

00:38.789 --> 00:41.124
I gotta get my Uggs on and get to work.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.378
Well, you sure you don't want
to just hang around for a little bit?

00:44.461 --> 00:48.006
- I got no plans.
- No, sadly, I have to go to my job,

00:48.090 --> 00:50.592
to help my boss find gigs
for you to turn down.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.970
If Marv brought me something good,
I would do it.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.597
Besides, I'm still decompressing
from my last gig.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.267
<i>Horsin' Around?</i>
That ended 11 years ago.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.103
Really? Where does the time go?

01:01.186 --> 01:04.231
What, you're just gonna stay at home
and get drunk all day?

01:04.314 --> 01:08.277
Don't climb up my ass. I invited you
to play hooky and hang out with me.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.029
I got a new HD DVD player.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.531
Let's get wrecked and get Shreked.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.826
BoJack, last night was fun
and you're sweet, sort of.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.454
- I don't want to make a thing of this.
- We agree. It's not a thing.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.123
- Not a thing.
- Definitely not a thing.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.293
No, this is not a thing.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.128
Yeah.

01:28.463 --> 01:35.095

<i>♪ Ah! This is a pop song</i>
<i>It's 2007 ♪</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:38.909
Hey, Todd, I think you just got a text.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.662
"Who do you like,
question mark, colon, bracket"?

02:41.745 --> 02:43.955
That's a smiley face, homeslice.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.999
- Who do you like?
- I don't like anyone.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.169
That's ridonkulous.
You have to like someone.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.964
If I have to, I guess, uh... Kimber?

02:53.048 --> 02:56.176
Everyone likes Kimber.
That's like saying you like Fergie.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.762
- Who do you like?
- I'm not allowed to like anyone.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.974
My dad is real strict.
Do you know <i>The Sopranos?</i>

03:03.058 --> 03:06.061
The show, or that weird saxophone
that Kenny G plays?

03:06.144 --> 03:10.065
The show, about the guy in the mob?
That's what my dad does.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.234
Whoa! Hey, speaking of mobs,

03:12.317 --> 03:15.445
we gotta bounce if we're gonna make
that flash mob at the Grove.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.114
Man, I love flash mobs.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.573
And I love you--

03:18.657 --> 03:21.827
Ubisoft's "Assassin's Creed".
It's a new video game.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.621
- Okay, let's go flash mob.
- Whoo! Flash mobs.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.457
<i>♪ This ain't 2006</i>
<i>It's 2007 ♪</i>

03:28.041 --> 03:30.627
I just don't know
how I feel about my husband

03:30.710 --> 03:33.213
doing a bunch of wacky commercials
overseas.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.674
Not overseas, underseas.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.885
You're looking at the new face
of Seaborn's Seahorse Milk.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.762
What the hell is seahorse milk?

03:40.846 --> 03:43.932
Beats me, but you better believe
I'm trusting Seaborn's.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.059
For all my seahorse milk needs.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.604
- It just seems a little cheesy.
- Hey, I'm not too big for anything.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.357
And my flip phone
is blowing up with opportunities.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.818
Michael Vick made me
a very strange offer.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.529
But I'm gonna hear him out.
Always take the meeting.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.030
Ahem. Can I help you?

03:59.114 --> 04:02.200
I'll have an Americano
with steamed milk instead of water.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.744
One latte?

04:03.827 --> 04:05.787
For you, my second and final wife?

04:05.871 --> 04:08.498
Oh, I usually like a cool drink
when it's hot outside

04:08.582 --> 04:10.500
and a warm drink when it's cold outside.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.879
But today is a perfect day, so--

04:13.962 --> 04:16.465
One lukewarm coffee
for my gorgeous spouse.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.382
Name?

04:17.466 --> 04:20.135
Jessica, obviously. I'm Jessica Biel?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.638
- Mmm... uh...
- From <i>Stealth</i>? <i>Summer Catch?</i>

04:23.722 --> 04:25.682
<i>Rules Of Attraction</i>? Nothing?

04:26.141 --> 04:29.394
Girl from <i>Seventh Heaven </i>who
took her clothes off for that magazine?

04:29.478 --> 04:32.439
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you, Blarn?

04:32.522 --> 04:34.065
That's my name.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.029
So she kissed a girl, huh?

04:39.112 --> 04:42.365
And she liked it? This I gotta see.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.742
Talk to you later.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.411
P.C., where are you hiding?

04:46.495 --> 04:49.831
Right out here, Marv, same place
I've been for the last 14 years.

04:49.915 --> 04:53.084
Get in here and tell me
what scripts I read this weekend.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.003
We have three standouts here.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.464
A feature called
<i>No Country For Old Men.</i>

04:57.547 --> 04:59.758
It's about a hunter who--

04:59.841 --> 05:04.179
Sorry, I fell asleep for a second.
Because that title's too long.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.182
<i>No Country For Old Men</i>
<i>It's About A Hunter Who?</i>

05:07.265 --> 05:08.391
Pass.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.603
- Aaah!
- Titles should be two words.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.022
<i>Pretty Woman. Beautiful Girls.</i>

05:14.105 --> 05:15.232
<i>Private Parts.</i>

05:15.315 --> 05:18.318
Then you might not like this next one,
<i>There Will Be Blood?</i>

05:18.401 --> 05:20.195
There will <i>not </i>be blood.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.532
I would have accepted
<i>There Will, </i>or <i>Be Blood.</i>

05:23.615 --> 05:25.992
- Firm pass.
- Oh!

05:26.076 --> 05:27.911
This last one is really special.

05:27.994 --> 05:32.874
It's a TV pilot from a veteran sitcom
writer named Cuddlywhiskers called...

05:33.667 --> 05:37.003
- Hmm... <i>Mitch's Life.</i>
- Now <i>there's </i>a title.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.340
I think if we attach the right talent,
this could be a hit.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.425
You know who'd be great?
BoJack Horseman.

05:43.635 --> 05:47.305
Don't make me laugh, because I have
a heart condition and it could kill me.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.850
Every little thing I bring that guy,
he turns down.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.852
I think with the right project,
BoJack could--

05:52.936 --> 05:57.482
Bup, bup, bup! P.C., do I get <i>you </i>coffee
and pick up your dry cleaning

05:57.566 --> 06:00.443
and buy you peek-a-boo negligees
for strange women

06:00.527 --> 06:03.613
- you saw at the train station once?
- No.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.492
Then how about I don't do your job
and you don't do my job?

06:07.576 --> 06:10.495
You know,
I would like to be an agent someday.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.747
Yeah, yeah, someday, sure.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.292
But for now,
you're learning from one of the greats.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.043
Mark my words.

06:17.127 --> 06:22.173
The best agent in the world
couldn't get that joker off his ass.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.383
Hmm...

06:25.594 --> 06:28.096
BoJack, I brought you Four Loko.

06:28.179 --> 06:32.100
I brought four Four Lokos.
That's 16 Lokos.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.644
Finally someone brings me
an adequate amount of Lokos.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.521
Are you trying to get me drunk?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.357
You <i>were </i>trying to get me drunk.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.318
Where are you taking me,
what am I wearing?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.861
To a meeting, and your clothes.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.905
Is this a fedora?
What am I, Jason Mirzizzerzaz?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.365
- I don't know.
- You know who.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.327
I knew you wouldn't take this meeting
if I didn't trick you into it.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.121
Cuddlywhiskers has a great script
and wants to meet you.

06:53.204 --> 06:56.249
I have a script for you. It's called
"The BoJack Says No Chronicles".

06:56.333 --> 06:57.709
Fade in, Princess Carolyn's car.

06:57.792 --> 07:02.422
Princess Carolyn: "Hey, BoJack, you want
to do this dumbass thing?" Act break.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.924
Act two.
BoJack turns to Princess Carolyn.

07:05.008 --> 07:08.011
BoJack: "No, thank you." End of episode.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.764
Hey! Aren't you the horse
from <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

07:10.847 --> 07:14.434
You see, this is why I don't
go out amongst the not-famouses.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.603
Just do me a favor
and take this meeting.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.313
If you're a good boy,

07:18.396 --> 07:21.942
we can do that weird French thing
you saw in that Internet video.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.234
Ooh, parkour?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.323
This show came to me
when I was in rehab.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.952
I realized I'm only here on this earth
for a bit, why not dig deeper?

07:32.035 --> 07:33.578
- Huh.
- Don't get me wrong.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.706
I'm proud of the seven years
I spent on <i>Krill & Grace.</i>

07:36.790 --> 07:39.876
That show did so much
for the way society views krill people.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.419
That show didn't make me happy.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.838
The awards, the money
didn't make me happy.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.924
Did you try spending the money on things?

07:46.007 --> 07:49.719
I started to feel like I was trapped
in a giant plastic ball.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.931
BoJack, meet my lovely assistant,
Jill Filipowicz.

07:53.014 --> 07:53.848
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.227
- Did I say you could speak, wench?
- You can't talk to me like that.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.940
- Clean up that mess this instant!
- No. I'm a dirty girl.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.693
- Uh...
- I'm filthy.

08:04.776 --> 08:08.029
- You are being very bad.
- You'll have to punish me later.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.909
Jill and I have a very...
special relationship.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.453
Want to tell me about the show?
I hear it's great.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.706
I've worked on great shows
my whole career.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.082
Great shows are easy.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.919
I didn't become president of the <i>Lampoon</i>
so I could make "great" shows.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.422
- <i>Harvard Lampoon.</i>
- Yeah, I got it.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.549
I'm trying to do something different here.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.759
- Something that lasts.
- Huh.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.677
Think about it.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.389
If you're ready to finally stop being
"The Horse" from <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

08:34.472 --> 08:38.018
send me an e-mail:
Cuddlywhiskers@harvard.edu.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.811
- That's H-A-R--
- I got it.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.191
You got some mail, babe.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.987
Mwah! You understand I'm using
that pet name ironically, right?

08:49.070 --> 08:50.071
Yes, Wayne.

08:50.155 --> 08:54.534
Oh, my God, check it out,
a rejection letter from <i>The New Yorker.</i>

08:54.617 --> 08:59.289
That magazine is for white people.
White people are the worst, right, guys?

08:59.831 --> 09:00.665
Yup.

09:00.749 --> 09:03.334
"Dear Diane.
We are sorry to say that your piece,

09:03.418 --> 09:06.004
'An Open Letter to Open Letters',
wasn't right for us,

09:06.087 --> 09:09.507
despite its evident merit."
Do you know what this means?

09:09.591 --> 09:12.927
Caring leads to disappointment?
Trying is stupid and so is having dreams?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.930
Someone gave my piece a read
and decided against it.

09:16.014 --> 09:19.267
Their journalistic style
couldn't be more outmoded.

09:19.350 --> 09:23.229
- Satire? More like "sa-tired."
- I never even thought they'd read it.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.525
"Talk of the Town"?
More like "Schlock of the Clown".

09:27.609 --> 09:31.112
Then they typed me a letter
that said it had "obvious merit".

09:31.196 --> 09:34.074
"Shouts and Murmurs"?
More like "Louts and..."

09:34.157 --> 09:35.617
What rhymes with murmurs?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.702
For two people
who don't like <i>The New Yorker,</i>

09:37.786 --> 09:40.663
you know a lot about the different
sections of <i>The New Yorker.</i>

09:42.207 --> 09:43.374
And then Cuddlywhiskers said:

09:43.458 --> 09:46.503
"What if we stopped thinking of TV
as a conduit to tell stories

09:46.586 --> 09:48.880
and thinking of it
as a conduit to tell truth?"

09:48.963 --> 09:52.300
And I was like: "Damn, this guy
must have gone to Yale or something."

09:52.383 --> 09:54.260
Sounds like you two really hit it off.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.513
We were like Heidi and Spencer
up in there.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.223
So you're gonna do the show?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.183
Nah. Timing's really off right now.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.186
iPhone's coming out this year,
I need to gear up for that.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.564
I'm done. That's it, I'm tired
of bending over backwards for you.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.942
I mean this in all seriousness,
professionally or in bed?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.736
Why won't you do this?
Give me one good reason.

10:11.820 --> 10:17.367
Because his show sounds incredible.
And what if... I'm not?

10:17.450 --> 10:20.787
What if there's a reason the only thing
I'm known for is <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

10:20.870 --> 10:23.832
BoJack, you are amazing.

10:23.915 --> 10:27.418
You're bright and you're funny
and you're handsome and you're talented.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.504
But if you can't see that,

10:29.587 --> 10:32.715
then you're the biggest,
dumbest piece of shit in the world.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.392
How long do we have to stay in here?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.727
- It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven.
- Uh...

10:44.811 --> 10:46.437
We don't have to kiss.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.731
I know you'd rather be in here
with Kimber.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.609
That's not true. It's just that, Emily...

10:51.693 --> 10:54.404
- What?
- I've never kissed anyone before.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.948
That's okay.
Maybe we can try with each other?

10:57.031 --> 11:00.702
That way, when you're in here with Kimber
one day, you'll know exactly what to do.

11:00.785 --> 11:06.124
Okay, so how should we do it?
French style, Eskimo, Butterfly?

11:06.207 --> 11:09.627
I'll tell you. I know exactly what to do
because I practice all the time

11:09.711 --> 11:11.754
with a picture of Adam Brody--
No, I don't!

11:12.881 --> 11:16.718
Just close your eyes,
and we move our faces toward each other.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.680
- Okay.
- Until we...

11:25.143 --> 11:27.353
Oh!

11:27.437 --> 11:31.149
Well, the elusive BoJack Horseman.

11:31.733 --> 11:36.863
You do, huh? Hey, Princess Carolyn,
guess who just got BoJack a job.

11:36.946 --> 11:41.618
You... are the secretary
of a wonderful agent.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.330
Now go pick up
a pair of satin crotchless undies.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.207
I saw a stewardess
at the Yum Yum Donuts.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.668
We did not make eye contact.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.546
<i>Good morning, Los Angeles.</i>

11:53.630 --> 11:56.883
<i>It's two months later in 2007.</i>

11:56.966 --> 11:59.427
<i>Two months later?</i>
<i>Two months later than what?</i>

11:59.510 --> 12:00.803
<i>Did I say two months later?</i>

12:00.887 --> 12:04.140
<i>Cookie chartreuse brontosaurus,</i>
<i>I think I'm having a stroke.</i>

12:04.223 --> 12:05.266
Aaah!

12:05.350 --> 12:07.894
- Jeez, sleep much?
- Jeez, watch me sleep much?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.312
Well, I couldn't sleep.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.314
I kept thinking about
today's first read-through.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.066
These things
are always so nerve-wracking,

12:13.149 --> 12:16.319
to sit there and perform
for all these people like some kind of a--

12:16.402 --> 12:18.738
- Professional actor?
- Very funny.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.574
Before I forget, I got you a present.

12:21.658 --> 12:26.079
It's a box...
with crinkly tissue paper inside it.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.455
How did you know?

12:27.538 --> 12:29.374
Thank you
for putting this whole thing together.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.794
Even though I still can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.712
Promise me
everything's going to be okay?

12:34.796 --> 12:36.923
I promise it's gonna be great.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.384
If you get scared,
look for me in the audience.

12:39.467 --> 12:43.221
I'll be there the whole time,
laughing and cheering louder than anyone.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.723
- Mmm...
- Mm-mmm-mm.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.979
"Mitch tosses the vodka bottle
into the garbage. Thud."

12:51.062 --> 12:52.522
"Goodbye, old friend."

12:52.605 --> 12:55.942
"Mitch turns off the light
and closes the door as we...

12:56.025 --> 12:58.528
Fade to black. End of episode."

13:01.864 --> 13:03.574
Thank you.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.620
Let's see what the suits say.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.623
Bet they're gonna want to bland it up,
make it appeal to middle America.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.875
That's the worst part of America.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.461
Other than the bottom,
the top and most of the sides.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.756
BoJack, Cuddlywhiskers,
what can we say?

13:18.840 --> 13:22.010
This is why you guys are the pros
and we're just the schmoes.

13:22.093 --> 13:25.930
I think what my husband
is trying to say is, "Great job."

13:26.014 --> 13:27.390
Enough with the torture.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.851
Don't have to feed me to finger me.
Just lay on the notes.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.562
Our only note? No notes.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.023
- No notes?
- We love this show.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.983
BoJack, I'm calling it right now.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.319
This show is gonna be as big
as <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

13:41.863 --> 13:43.322
Huh.

13:43.406 --> 13:49.245
And then Justin said, "Jessica Biel?
You are un-Jessica-Bielievable."

13:49.328 --> 13:51.122
- It was so funny.
- Wow.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.375
It seems like you're really
in sync with this Justin guy.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.211
You should do all the things
with him that I can't do.

13:57.295 --> 14:01.424
Like eat chocolate,
or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.261
Why, tennis makes me so mad.
Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball?

14:05.344 --> 14:08.264
Hello? Can we please get
some service in this place?

14:08.347 --> 14:12.685
I'm famous actress Jessica Biel.
I'm one of the Jessicas.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.354
Mom, I'm finally gonna be
a published writer.

14:15.438 --> 14:18.775
My "Open Letter to Open Letters"
is going to be published in McSweeney's.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.985
Mc-What? Who's that? Some Irish?

14:21.069 --> 14:24.113
No, Mom. It's a very popular website.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.824
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that scam.

14:26.908 --> 14:30.286
Website? We gotta print it out
on our own paper with our own ink?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.704
<i>- I don't think so.</i>
- Mom.

14:31.788 --> 14:35.249
And my Blockbuster original series
has been keeping me very busy.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.752
I still don't get how that's gonna work,
at all.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.587
Babe, it makes total sense.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.131
They make the whole season,
put it on six DVD's.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.217
People go to their local Blockbuster Video

14:44.300 --> 14:47.053
and rent it out one disc at a time
for five days each.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.180
What if someone already rented
the episodes they want?

14:49.263 --> 14:53.101
They can just get something else,
like <i>The Illusionist </i>or <i>The Prestige.</i>

14:53.184 --> 14:55.895
- Whichever one you were in.
- Do you know which one?

14:55.978 --> 14:58.398
Do you?

14:58.481 --> 15:03.111
- Why do you say yes to everything?
- I get excited by the possibilities.

15:03.194 --> 15:06.280
Look, a CD, at a coffee shop?
That is crazy.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.241
- Buying it.
- Eh-eh eh-eh! No.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.201
Drop it. Drop it.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.494
Good boy.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.666
Buzz-buzz-buzz buzz buzz-buzz!

15:16.749 --> 15:19.252
- You heard what the network said.
- Heard they loved it.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.920
Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.047
Exactly. The network loved it.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.924
Obviously, we're playing it too safe.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.344
If you want my opinion, fellas,
you hit oil, stop drilling.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.348
"I am an oil man.
I drink your milkshake."

15:32.432 --> 15:35.810
- That'll be funny in a year or so.
- Before that got sad and weird,

15:35.893 --> 15:38.271
you said, "If you want my opinion,"
and we don't.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.107
Cuddlywhiskers, you told me
you wanted to do something different.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.735
Now we're doing something that's gonna be
"just as good as <i>Horsin' Around</i>."

15:44.819 --> 15:47.071
Is that what you wanted?
That's not why I'm here.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.782
- I know.
- I really think you're making a mistake.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.284
I'm not taking career advice

15:51.367 --> 15:53.786
from somebody who's been
an assistant the last 14 years.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.581
Is that how you think of me?
As your agent's assistant?

15:56.664 --> 15:59.125
- What do you think you are?
- I don't know.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.210
Here's some free advice:
you should know.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.171
Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups?

16:03.254 --> 16:05.131
Somebody needs coffee,
I'll give you a ring.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.008
Okay, best of luck.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.053
Cuddlywhiskers,
let's give ourselves one night

16:11.137 --> 16:15.725
to stick our dicks in this script
and go balls deep into the universe.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.018
I'm in.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.899
What's that, you say?
There's a panic? At the disco?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.901
I gotta go. What do you want, Toots?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.570
I want to be an agent. I think I'm ready.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.573
Again with this
"I wanna be a female agent" thing.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.994
They don't even have a word for it.
Uh, agentess, agentrix.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.331
- It's just called "agent", Marv, agent.
- Okay, okay!

16:38.414 --> 16:42.251
You're an agent, all right?
I dub thee agent.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.046
You can even take my office,
because I quit.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.881
- What?
- Who needs the headache?

16:46.964 --> 16:53.221
Thirty years I threw into this job
and it destroyed me from the inside out.

16:53.304 --> 16:57.016
I never fell in love,
I never had a family.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.269
I never even got to give that lacy teddy

17:00.353 --> 17:03.481
to the mean woman who worked at the DMV.

17:03.564 --> 17:07.735
All I have is regrets.

17:08.444 --> 17:13.282
Oh, my God, I'm an agent!
I'm gonna make it after all.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.036
Whaah!

17:17.119 --> 17:20.081
First thing I'm gonna do
is get rid of that ceiling fan.

17:21.999 --> 17:25.503
How do we make it clear
that this isn't <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

17:25.586 --> 17:28.589
What if in the very first scene,
we show my character

17:28.673 --> 17:33.844
literally taking a massive dump
on a VHS copy of <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

17:33.928 --> 17:35.179
What? That's insane.

17:35.263 --> 17:38.140
Let's just put it in,
we can always take it out later.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.643
I want this character to be really edgy,

17:40.726 --> 17:43.437
the kind of character Denis Leary
would be offered and then say:

17:43.521 --> 17:45.189
"This character's too edgy for me."

17:45.273 --> 17:47.733
What if he had a catchphrase
that was an anti-catchphrase?

17:47.817 --> 17:51.654
Like if every time he entered the room
he was like, "Whassup, bitches?"

17:52.530 --> 17:54.991
Not that, because that's horrible.
But something like that.

17:55.074 --> 17:55.950
Whassup, bitches?

17:56.033 --> 17:58.202
- That is so dumb.
- But kind of brilliant, right?

17:58.286 --> 18:01.581
Yes, put that in.
Put all this in, this should be the show.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.292
This should be the show.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.211
I haven't felt this alive
since the head of the Charles Regatta.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.839
- That's a Harvard thing.
- Yes. This is brilliant.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.925
What if we had five minutes of him
reading a book to himself?

18:13.009 --> 18:14.302
Oh, my God, yes.

18:14.385 --> 18:17.471
Just him turning the page.
A close-up of my eyeball.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.558
The real shit, they never show that.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.852
Wow, we did it.

18:22.935 --> 18:27.106
We stayed up all night, but we really made
something new and different and daring.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.774
We've changed everything but the title.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.319
Well, then, how about
we give it a new title?

18:31.402 --> 18:33.529
<i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

18:33.613 --> 18:35.948
Oh, Cuddlywhiskers,
I don't know what to say.

18:36.032 --> 18:39.368
Well, then why don't you just say,
"Whassup, bitches?"

18:39.452 --> 18:41.203
But, you know, not that.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.581
- Something like that.
- We'll figure it out.

18:46.626 --> 18:50.880
Seriously, can I hear 400 dollars?
Let's not forget why we're here tonight.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.132
To raise money
for the John Edwards campaign.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.426
I was talking
to one of the volunteers earlier

18:55.509 --> 18:58.596
and she was just gushing
about how John Edwards touched her.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.725
I say, let's make this man president
so he can touch whoever he wants.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.353
- Four hundred dollars.
- I don't know what's cheesier,

19:05.436 --> 19:07.897
this three-cheese risotto
or that dude's patter.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.856
Seriously.

19:08.939 --> 19:13.319
This fundraiser should have a fundraiser
for a better host of this fundraiser.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.278
Totes McGotes.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.989
I'll post that to my Twitter page.
You should follow me.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.701
I'm A with a circle around it,
"insWayne in the membWayne".

19:20.785 --> 19:22.286
What's a Twitter page?

19:22.370 --> 19:26.749
Erica, you know you're not
allowed to vote in national elections.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.090
You sure it's okay
to be in your parents' bedroom?

19:34.173 --> 19:38.010
Todd, so we've been together
for months now.

19:38.094 --> 19:42.181
Um, I was thinking maybe that we try sex?

19:42.264 --> 19:43.099
Uh...

19:43.182 --> 19:45.935
We don't have to.
I don't wanna peer pressure you.

19:46.018 --> 19:50.189
No. I'm ready for sexual situations.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.943
- Um...
- Hooray. Um, taking your virginity.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.861
Yeah, sure. That's how I would say it.

19:55.945 --> 20:01.117
Okay, here we-- Here I go.
Uh, this is Todd doing sex.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.577
Did you hear that?

20:03.661 --> 20:07.248
Oh, snap. My dad's home early.
You gotta get out of here.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.874
Your dad, the mobster?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.459
What? My dad's not a mobster.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.878
You said he was like that guy
from <i>The Sopranos.</i>

20:12.962 --> 20:15.589
I said he works on <i>The Sopranos</i>.
He's an editor.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.591
Oh, God, oh, God! Even worse.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.969
He must be so desensitized to violence

20:20.052 --> 20:22.972
and nihilistic ruminations
on the banality of evil.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.224
Here, out the window.
You love shimmying, right?

20:25.307 --> 20:29.061
You know I love shimmying,
but that's a two-story drop.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.604
Use this.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.066
- Go, get out. Go, go!
- Uh, okay.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.777
Oh, shit.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.654
Sorry.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.745
Whoa, whoa, Tony marries Dr. Melfi?

20:45.828 --> 20:48.080
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

20:52.626 --> 20:55.921
- So, the island's purgatory, right?
- What's really happening--

20:56.005 --> 20:57.339
Hold that thought.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.967
Hey, Princess Carolyn, you came.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.846
I figured since I'm your agent, I should
at least show up to your premiere party.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.682
I know I haven't called in a while.
I've been really busy.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.101
I figured you'd call me
if you needed a coffee.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.020
Ouch.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.439
Hey, big premiere tonight.
Very exciting.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.356
Yeah.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.568
After tonight, it's no more "Aren't you
the horse from <i>Horsin' Around?"</i>

21:17.651 --> 21:20.529
From now on it'll be,
"You're BoJack Horseman."

21:20.613 --> 21:22.406
I'm happy for you, BoJack.

21:22.490 --> 21:25.075
- How about a kiss for good luck?
- No, BoJack.

21:25.159 --> 21:28.746
I'm your agent and your friend,
and I will always support you.

21:28.829 --> 21:33.000
But I'm 33 years old, and I want
to have a family by the time I'm 40.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.629
I don't want to spend the next seven years
in and out of love with you.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.590
I've wasted too much time
waiting for things to happen.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.342
And I'm not gonna wait anymore.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.055
And for what it's worth, I always liked
the horse from <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

21:46.138 --> 21:49.350
- You did?
- Yeah. Everybody did.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.105
Unbelievable.
Un-Jessica-Bielievable.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.274
Can we not fight while I'm at a gig?

21:57.358 --> 22:00.569
There are a lot of big producers,
this could be my next big break.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.947
This podunk benefit is below us.

22:03.030 --> 22:07.076
I'm about to be in what I've been told
is a very important gay rights movie,

22:07.159 --> 22:08.869
<i>I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.</i>

22:08.953 --> 22:12.957
I now pronounce me very impressed,
but I'm not getting those kinds of offers.

22:13.040 --> 22:17.795
- As Justin would say, "Cry me a river."
- Hey, if you like Justin so much,

22:17.878 --> 22:20.589
maybe you should just continue
to be really good friends with him.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.424
Fine, maybe I will marry Justin.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.009
Uh, I didn't say that.

22:24.093 --> 22:27.846
I now pronounce this marriage over.
Biel with it.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.602
- You wanted water?
- Thanks.

22:33.686 --> 22:37.231
Wait. Blarn, right?
Yeah, from the coffee shop.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.401
What are you doing here?
Is there coffee to "bariste"?

22:40.484 --> 22:43.362
I also do cater waiter gigs
to make ends meet.

22:43.445 --> 22:47.533
You "bariste" and cater <i>and</i> waiter?
Triple threat.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.451
I should be bringing you the water.

22:49.535 --> 22:54.081
You know, just for the record, I think
it's cool that you put yourself out there.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.625
A lot of guys in your position
wouldn't take gigs like this.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.919
They'd be afraid people
would make fun of them.

22:59.003 --> 22:59.878
That's dumb.

22:59.962 --> 23:03.090
If you care about what other people think,
you're never gonna do anything.

23:03.173 --> 23:06.427
- Yeah, you're right.
- Oh, my God, I'm so glad you agree.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.513
I was like, "Why did I say that?
That was so dumb."

23:09.597 --> 23:12.683
Then you were like, "That's right."
And I was like, "Ooh! Validation."

23:12.766 --> 23:15.561
- Hey, mind if I change out of this shirt?
- Go ahead.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.813
This monkey suit is killing me.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.274
Oof! Hey there, Delilah.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.236
Sweet hang, Blarn.
You're one in a million.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.614
- Actually, my name isn't Blarn.
- What?

23:26.697 --> 23:28.991
I put that on my nametag as a dumb joke

23:29.074 --> 23:31.493
to subvert the idea
of co-opting personal identity

23:31.577 --> 23:35.164
to further corporate branding which,
as I'm saying it, isn't much of a joke.

23:36.498 --> 23:40.085
"Blarn." That is very funny.
You should be a writer.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.087
Thanks. I'm Diane.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.922
- Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah, I know.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.633
- Add me on MySpace, okay?
- Sure.

23:45.716 --> 23:50.054
All right.
Guess I'll see you around, Diana.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.181
It's Diane.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.226
Hey, buddy, slight change of plans.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.312
Call it off.
Call the whole thing off.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.689
What do you mean?
We premiere in two minutes.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.399
Call the network,
cancel the whole thing.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.860
Nobody wants to see me take a dump
on a <i>Horsin' Around</i> VHS.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.739
BoJack, it's going to be fine.
This is what we wanted, remember?

24:08.822 --> 24:11.116
Easy for you to say.
It's my name on the show.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.578
This is why I didn't want to do
another TV show. Everything was perfect.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.831
BoJack, this shit is bananas.
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.917
I can't promise everyone
will love this show.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.752
No matter what, people will remember it.

24:21.835 --> 24:25.297
Five, ten years from now, this is the show
people will associate you with,

24:25.381 --> 24:27.132
and you'll be glad they do.

24:27.216 --> 24:30.094
Because this show is real,
it's edgy, it's different.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.554
A lesser talent
couldn't have pulled it off.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.015
But I'm willing to bet
on BoJack Horseman.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.643
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

24:37.726 --> 24:42.189
Great. Because the show is starting
and your life is about to change forever,

24:42.272 --> 24:44.817
in three, two, one.
