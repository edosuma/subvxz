WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:01.635
Nothing much.
What's up with you?

00:01.669 --> 00:04.072
I cannot believe
I feel for that.

00:04.105 --> 00:06.307
Gosh.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.076
Ha ha. What?

00:08.109 --> 00:10.078
What?
Where's the funny?

00:10.111 --> 00:12.080
Give it to me.

00:12.113 --> 00:16.284
Um, is it me or does it
smell like updog in here?

00:16.317 --> 00:17.051
What's updog?

00:17.085 --> 00:20.254
Nothing much.
What's up with you?

00:20.288 --> 00:22.256
Oh, wow.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.725
I walked right into that.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.328
Oh, that's brilliant.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.563
Hey, Stanley.
Is that jacket made of updog?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.532
I'm on the phone.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.269
Mm!

00:35.303 --> 00:37.805
What flavor coffee
is that, updog?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.307
What's that?

00:39.340 --> 00:42.076
I don't know. Nothing.
What's up with you?

00:42.110 --> 00:44.445
Huh?
No.
Damn it.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.280
What does that mean?

00:46.314 --> 00:47.281
What does what mean?

00:47.315 --> 00:48.382
That thing you just said.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.783
Just forget it.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.185
Dwight.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.520
Hey, is it me,

00:52.553 --> 00:55.223
or does this place
smell like updog?

00:55.256 --> 00:56.224
What's updog?

00:56.257 --> 00:57.791
Gotcha!

00:57.825 --> 00:59.593
Oh, God!

00:59.627 --> 01:01.329
Crap.

01:02.796 --> 01:06.167
Nothing.
How are you doing?

01:06.200 --> 01:08.636
Good.
How are you doing?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.604
Mm.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.748
Today is spring cleaning day
here at Dunder-Mifflin.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.251
And yes, I know it's January.
I am not an idiot.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.620
But if you do your spring
cleaning in January,

01:59.653 --> 02:01.822
guess what you don't have
to do in the spring?

02:01.855 --> 02:04.358
Anything.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.760
They say a cluttered desk
means a cluttered mind.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.230
Well, I say an empty desk
means an--

02:09.263 --> 02:10.631
Empty mind.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.899
No, that's not--
No.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.268
That's not what
I was gonna say.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.903
Meredith, men's room.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.306
Make sure you replace
the urinal cakes.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.240
They're worn down.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.442
Kevin, file drawers.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.212
Angela, kitchen.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.714
Oscar, dusting.
Where is Oscar?

02:26.747 --> 02:27.881
He's out sick.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.284
That's unacceptable.

02:30.318 --> 02:34.522
I agree.
It's unacceptable.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.427
What are you guys doing?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.964
Michael.
Yes.

02:43.997 --> 02:49.303
Oscar is out sick.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.805
On a Friday?

02:55.843 --> 02:56.810
Can I do some of the talking?

02:56.844 --> 02:58.212
I will do the talking.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.380
Okay, let him know
that I'm here though.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.548
Hello?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.416
What difference does it make
whether you're here?
Hello?

03:02.450 --> 03:04.318
Hi, Oscar, it's Michael.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.886
And Dwight.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.921
Yeah, um, heard you were
under the weather.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.923
Yeah, I think I came down
with the flu.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.526
Really. Oh, that is a shame.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.595
You know, it's cleaning day
here today.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.864
Could've used some of that
famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.400
Yeah, I feel terrible about it.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.834
Ask for his symptoms--
I'm on WebMD.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.936
What are your symptoms?

03:22.970 --> 03:25.573
I have the chills,
I'm feeling nauseous,

03:25.606 --> 03:29.377
and my head's killing.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.944
Checks out.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.846
Michael, is there anything
you need from me?

03:32.880 --> 03:33.914
I would like to go
back to bed.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.450
I need you to go to bed.
I need you to get better.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.519
See you Monday,
unless you're still sick.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.987
So, have a great long weekend.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.955
I'll just be sleep--

03:41.989 --> 03:44.458
Okay, first impressions.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.893
He sounded sick.

03:45.926 --> 03:46.860
Which is exactly how you'd
want to sound

03:46.894 --> 03:48.729
if you wanted someone
to think you were sick.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.030
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.400
Question, may I investigate?

03:52.433 --> 03:56.270
Yeah, drop what you're doing.
Make this a priority.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.906
Because an office can't
function efficiently

03:58.939 --> 04:02.376
unless people are at their desks
doing their jobs.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.711
I bought my veil.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.946
Oh, my God,
that is so exciting.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.014
Can I be a bridesmaid?

04:07.047 --> 04:09.317
Um...

04:09.350 --> 04:10.618
Listen, you don't
have to answer now,

04:10.651 --> 04:11.885
but how are you gonna
do your hair?

04:11.919 --> 04:14.988
Okay, I was thinking about
wearing it down.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.958
Kinda like,
I don't know, like...

04:17.991 --> 04:18.992
loose with big curls.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.296
You look like an angel.
I'm seriously gonna cry.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.598
Wowie.
Mikey likey.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.734
Why don't you wear your hair
like that all the time?

04:26.767 --> 04:30.604
It's much sexier.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.040
Man, this must be
torture for you.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.744
Yeah, on the booze cruise,

04:36.777 --> 04:39.347
I told Michael about
some feelings

04:39.380 --> 04:41.349
I used to have for Pam.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.985
I had just broken up with Katie,
and had a couple of drinks,

04:45.018 --> 04:49.923
and I confided in the world's
worst confidant.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.727
Okay.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.329
Hey, Mike.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.564
Hey, Jim bag.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.901
Remember that thing I told you
on the booze cruise about Pam?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.437
That was personal.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.606
So, if we could just keep
that between you and me,

05:05.639 --> 05:06.807
that would be great.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.342
Really?
Mm-hmm.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.610
Who else knows?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.011
Nobody.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.780
Wow.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.014
Jim and I are great friends.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.016
We hang out a ton.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.818
Mostly at work.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.588
But the fact that he told me
his secret and no one else,

05:20.621 --> 05:22.523
says everything about
our friendship.

05:22.556 --> 05:26.360
And it is why I intend
on keeping that secret

05:26.394 --> 05:29.997
for as long as I possibly can.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.632
My lips are sealed.
* My lips are sealed

05:31.665 --> 05:33.033
Bangles.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.902
All right, great, thank you.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.504
* Can you hear me

05:36.537 --> 05:38.906
* They talk about us

05:38.939 --> 05:40.674
* Telling lies *

05:40.708 --> 05:45.579
Listen, temp, I am conducting
a little investigation.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.816
So, I am no longer gonna be able
to head up spring cleaning.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.017
Do you think you
can handle it?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.585
Yeah, I think I can handle it.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.988
Do you think,
or do you know?

05:55.022 --> 05:59.026
I think.

05:59.059 --> 06:02.630
Oh, God.
Here.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.666
Hey, whatcha getting?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.034
I'm going with grape.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.837
Ah, good stuff.
Good stuff.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.004
Yup.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.640
See the game last night?

06:12.673 --> 06:14.007
Which game?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.009
Any of 'em.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.947
So, uh, what's the 4

06:19.980 --> 06:22.450
Any updates
on the "P" situation?

06:22.483 --> 06:23.884
I don't know what you mean--

06:23.917 --> 06:26.019
P-A-M--
P

06:26.053 --> 06:27.588
Okay.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.722
No, it's okay.
We're talking code.

06:28.756 --> 06:29.923
Well--
What is?

06:29.957 --> 06:31.191
Listen, Stan--
how long does it take you

06:31.224 --> 06:32.626
for you to pick out a soda?

06:32.660 --> 06:34.094
I'm gonna take off, actually.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.029
All right, well.
Cool.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.166
Still deciding?

06:39.199 --> 06:40.701
Hmm?

06:42.169 --> 06:45.105
Peach iced tea.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.974
You're gonna hate it.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.777
Hey, Oscar, how you doing?
Dwight Schrute calling.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.679
Listen, little question
for you, buddy.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.748
I called six minutes ago,
and no one answered.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.618
So I was wondering
if you could expl--

06:57.651 --> 06:59.152
Oh, I see.

06:59.186 --> 07:02.122
So, sounds like you're too sick
to come into work,

07:02.155 --> 07:04.625
but you're well enough
to go to the pharmacy.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.661
There are several different ways
to tell if a perp is lying.

07:07.695 --> 07:10.931
The liar will avoid
direct eye contact.

07:10.964 --> 07:15.503
The liar will cover part of his
or her face with his hand.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.605
Especially the mouth.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.841
The liar will perspire.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.611
Unfortunately, I spoke
to Oscar on the phone.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.879
So none of this is useful.

07:30.017 --> 07:34.021
It's grrrrape soda.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.889
Tony the Tiger, you don't hear
that much anymore.

07:35.923 --> 07:36.990
Not so much.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.692
Okay, what is
going on here?

07:38.726 --> 07:40.260
Nothing.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.962
Oh, really, nothing?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.564
Fact, you are
drinking grape soda.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.833
You never drink grape soda.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.035
Fact, you are talking to Jim,
you never talk to Jim.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.504
Fact, I love grape soda.
I always have.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.640
Fact, Jim and I talk
all the time.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.808
We tell each other secrets.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.143
Okay, so what is the secret,
Michael?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.546
Um, I had asked Michael

07:58.579 --> 08:00.948
if I could head up the Oscar
investigation,

08:00.981 --> 08:04.518
and he said that only Dwight
was capable of handling

08:04.552 --> 08:08.055
such sensitive material.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.690
Is that true?

08:09.723 --> 08:13.160
Um...

08:13.193 --> 08:18.899
I-I don't know.
Uh, yeah, yeah, it is.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.536
Thank you, Michael.
I know you're telling the truth.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.204
Okay.
I can tell.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.139
I won't let you down.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.175
Good.
Thanks.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.214
Nice, that was--that was slick.
What're you doing for lunch?

08:34.247 --> 08:36.750
I don't know, I'm probably just
gonna eat my ham and cheese

08:36.784 --> 08:37.885
sandwich in the break room.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.887
Oh, nonsense.
No way, no.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.154
Why don't, uh--

08:41.188 --> 08:43.290
Why don't I take you
out to lunch? My treat.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.892
Uh, no, that's all right.
Thank you, though.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.326
It's--I gotta do
some cleaning.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.828
I should probably
stick around here.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.196
Hey, you know
what we could do?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.664
Spread out a blanket
in the break room,

08:50.698 --> 08:54.201
have a little picnic,
order some 'za.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.836
Talk about you-know-who.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.071
Oh, um, nope.
You know what, let's go out.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.206
That was a good idea.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.074
Let's go out.
I know just the place.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.576
Really?

09:04.945 --> 09:07.981
Oh, man.
You should order milk.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.016
Get it?

09:10.618 --> 09:13.120
Why do I like Hooters?

09:13.153 --> 09:15.856
Well, I will give
you two reasons.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.059
The boobs and the hot wings.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.295
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.964
Bogie at three o'clock.
Hi.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.232
Hey, I'm Dana.
Welcome to Hooters.

09:25.265 --> 09:29.302
We're not worthy.
We're not worthy.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.238
Hello, Dana.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.141
I am Michael,
and this is Jim.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.308
And we are brothers.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.277
Nope. We're not brothers.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.212
I'm his boss, actually.
And I treat him well.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.049
I'm taking him out to lunch
because I can afford it.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.784
And he can have
whatever he wants.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.719
I'll just have the ham
and cheese sandwich, thanks.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.954
And for you?

09:46.987 --> 09:49.189
Tell me, Dana.
How is your chicken breast?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.257
Oh, it's great.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.225
It's served with our
world-famous wing sauce.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.295
Mm, sounds yummy.
I will have a chicken breast.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.263
Hold the chicken.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.233
Is that what you really want?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.939
No, I'm gonna have
the gourmet hotdog.

10:05.973 --> 10:09.609
Great.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.346
Who took all the black ones?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.815
That's a communal bowl.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.651
So, how did Oscar sound
when he called in?

10:17.685 --> 10:20.353
Sick. Like, lots of sniffling.
I don't know.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.289
Sniffling how?

10:22.322 --> 10:25.058
Um, how many different ways
are there to gonna sniffle?

10:25.092 --> 10:26.326
Three.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.829
Okay, it was the second one.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.363
Okay, good.
Thank you.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.765
That wasn't so hard,
now was it?

10:31.799 --> 10:33.366
Mm-mm.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.873
What do you like
best about Pam?

10:39.907 --> 10:41.274
Oh, I really don't wanna
talk about it.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.376
Her legs or boobs, or...?

10:43.410 --> 10:47.147
Um, she's easy
to talk to, I guess.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.783
And, uh, she's got a really good
sense of humor.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.384
Really?
Mm-hmm.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.920
She never gets any
of my jokes.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.723
What about you?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.157
Her boobs, definitely.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.893
Wow, that's not what I meant.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.194
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.295
And I understand,

11:02.329 --> 11:04.097
We have a birthday today.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.267
Oh, happy birthday, Jim.
Ready, girls?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.469
Front side!
* You put your front side in

11:09.502 --> 11:11.271
* You put your front side out

11:11.304 --> 11:12.706
* You put your front side in

11:12.740 --> 11:14.274
* And you shake it all about

11:14.307 --> 11:17.410
* You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn yourself around *

11:17.444 --> 11:19.079
* That's what it's all about *

11:19.112 --> 11:20.413
Thank you.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.882
Whoo! Yeah!

11:21.915 --> 11:23.283
Thanks.
Thanks, Dana.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.119
Thank you very much.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.488
Whew.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.290
That was hilarious. Hey.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.259
What did you guys talk about?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.395
Just, you know, politics.
Literature.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.166
I hate you.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.001
Quick Oscar update.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.803
I have conducted interviews
with everyone in the office--

11:42.836 --> 11:44.404
Just go to his house
and see if he's sick.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.773
I could've done this
investigation in,

11:45.806 --> 11:46.940
like, 20 minutes.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.275
Including prep time?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.778
Just do it.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.351
If I had to, I could clean
out my desk in five seconds

11:58.385 --> 12:01.855
and nobody would ever know
I had ever been here.

12:01.889 --> 12:06.426
And I'd forget too.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.905
Expense this.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.006
Michael, is that a wig?

12:19.039 --> 12:21.508
No, it's--

12:21.541 --> 12:24.244
I wear it like that sometimes.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.445
Is that a wig?

12:25.478 --> 12:27.214
This is from Hooters.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.016
Yeah, it was a business lunch.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.183
Did Toby approve this?

12:30.217 --> 12:31.318
No, he did not.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.053
I don't need his permission.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.155
They just just got your
corporate credit card back.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.924
Do you really want me
to take it away again?

12:36.957 --> 12:38.291
It's ridiculous.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.927
They took my card away

12:39.960 --> 12:42.429
because I spent 80 bucks
at a magic shop.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.232
What they don't understand
is that I bought the stuff

12:45.265 --> 12:47.367
to impress potential clients.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.037
So business

12:50.070 --> 12:52.840
I put a cigarette through
a freaking quarter.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.274
And you know what, Toby?

12:54.307 --> 12:55.843
They almost bought from us.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.344
I'm not processing this.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.280
Look, Jim needed
a relaxing lunch.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.915
He has been depressed.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.917
And it has been affecting
his productivity.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.285
How is that not work

13:05.318 --> 13:06.887
He seems fine to me.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.421
You're not his friend.
You don't know.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.258
He is in love with a girl
he works with who's engaged.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.961
So just cut me some slack,
please.

13:13.994 --> 13:18.131
Pam?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.606
Hey, Angela,
who would you choose?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.108
Jim or Roy?

13:28.141 --> 13:30.510
It's nobody's business, Phyllis.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.280
Roy.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.049
Jim has got it bad for Pam.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.518
Oh-ho.
Which one is Pam?

13:38.551 --> 13:40.921
Well, she di--

13:40.954 --> 13:42.422
Hey, Michael?
Hmm?

13:42.455 --> 13:44.958
So do you think Jim will try
to break up the wedding?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.394
You know what, Kevin?
Jim is a friend of mine.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.397
So the only people that
this crush really concerns

13:50.430 --> 13:52.299
is Jim and Pam...and me.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.369
As a volunteer sheriff's deputy,

13:56.403 --> 13:58.305
I've been doing surveillance
for years.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.007
One time,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.043
I suspected an ex-girlfriend
of mine of cheating on me.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.445
So I tailed her
for six nights straight.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.214
Turns out she was.

14:07.247 --> 14:11.985
With a couple of guys,
actually, so.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.121
Mystery solved.

14:14.154 --> 14:18.425
Jim, why didn't you tell me
that you had a crush on Pam?

14:20.227 --> 14:21.628
Well, the cat's out of the bag.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.231
I used to have a crush on Pam.

14:24.264 --> 14:28.168
And now I don't.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.436
Riveting.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.539
Yeah.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.341
No, it's not.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.343
Nice.

14:36.376 --> 14:41.114
She is so hot.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.518
Hey.
Hey.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.155
Did you find anything good
in your desk?

14:48.188 --> 14:50.157
Uh, coupon
for a free sandwich.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.125
Score.
Expired in August.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.361
And my cell phone charger
from two years ago.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.497
Big day.
Big day.

14:57.530 --> 15:01.568
Hey, uh, listen.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.571
Um...

15:04.604 --> 15:08.508
I told Michael
on the booze cruise--

15:08.541 --> 15:10.143
So stupid.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.180
Um...

15:13.213 --> 15:17.350
I told Michael that I had
had a crush on you

15:17.384 --> 15:20.220
when you first started here.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.122
Oh.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.557
Well, I just thought that--

15:24.591 --> 15:27.394
I figured you should
hear it from me.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.098
Rather than, I mean,
you know Michael.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.000
Right.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.735
And...seriously.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.471
It's totally not a big deal.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.274
Okay?

15:41.308 --> 15:44.144
And when I found out
that you were engaged, I mean--

15:44.177 --> 15:46.113
No, I--I know.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.049
Like, I kind of--
Like, I--

15:49.082 --> 15:50.350
I thought that maybe you did.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.585
When I first started.
Oh, you did?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.988
No, I mean, just 'cause we,
like, got along so well.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.189
No, I know, yeah.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.290
You saw through me.
Great.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.295
So are you gonna be, like,
totally awkward around me now?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.563
Oh, yeah.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.565
Yeah.

16:05.598 --> 16:09.569
Hope that's okay.
Mm-hmm.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.738
And Pam.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.774
It was, like,
three years ago.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.578
So I am totally over it.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.613
Cool.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.549
Okay.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.464
This is it. There he is.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.766
He's been gone
for at least two--

16:39.799 --> 16:41.434
Who is that?

16:41.468 --> 16:42.802
Come to Papa.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.772
I got it. Close that.
You got those.

16:45.805 --> 16:49.342
Oh, yes. Oh, nice.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.677
Let's roll.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.445
I knew it!

16:56.849 --> 17:00.153
Oh, man, you are so busted.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.123
Ice-skates.
Shopping bags.

17:03.156 --> 17:06.226
I think I know what's
going on here.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.794
You weren't sick at all.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.629
Who's this?

17:09.662 --> 17:12.132
This is Dwight Schrute.
Who is this?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.467
Gil.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.835
Are you going to tell Michael?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.304
How 'bout this?

17:17.337 --> 17:19.739
I don't tell Michael,
and in exchange,

17:19.772 --> 17:23.110
you owe me one great, big,
giant favor

17:23.143 --> 17:27.780
redeemable by me at a time
and place of my choosing.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.750
Guess what I found out
about Oscar tonight?

17:30.783 --> 17:34.087
He was lying about being sick.

17:34.121 --> 17:37.290
Should I have reported
Oscar's malfeasance?

17:37.324 --> 17:39.259
Hmm, probably.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.162
But know I know something
he doesn't want me to know.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.164
So I can use his malfeasance

17:44.197 --> 17:46.166
to establish leverage.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.301
Otherwise, it's just malfeasance

17:48.335 --> 17:51.804
For malfeasance's-s sake.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.175
Hey.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.344
I know.
I know, I know.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.313
Um...

18:00.347 --> 18:02.215
What happened?

18:02.249 --> 18:03.650
I--oh.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.119
Just, um, you know,

18:06.153 --> 18:08.255
I was trying--
just the expense reports.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.890
And then
He just--

18:10.923 --> 18:13.260
I know.
I just--

18:13.293 --> 18:15.328
I just hope that--

18:15.362 --> 18:19.532
Oh, I just hope that this
doesn't affect our friendship!

18:21.534 --> 18:24.704
It's stupid.
It's so stupid.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.905
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.875
Listen, man, it's--

18:28.908 --> 18:31.778
You know, it's not a big deal.
It's gonna be fine.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.580
No, I know.
I'm good, I'm good.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.882
It's just--

18:35.915 --> 18:38.751
Look, it's one day.
Everything's gonna be all right.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.287
Yeah, okay.
You good?

18:40.320 --> 18:43.390
Yeah, I'm good.
Okay.

18:43.423 --> 18:46.893
Creed, did you organize
the menu book?

18:46.926 --> 18:49.229
Oh, I thought that was
more on a volunteer basis.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.399
No. That was mandatory.

18:52.432 --> 18:56.135
Oh, I thought it was
a volunteer thing.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.576
Hey, here's your schedule
for next week.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.944
Are you okay?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.280
Yeah, I'm fine. Look.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.815
About you and Jim--

19:08.848 --> 19:10.217
Oh, no, that's--
You don't have to--

19:10.250 --> 19:12.685
No, I just feel it's my
responsibility

19:12.719 --> 19:14.421
as your boss-slash-friend--

19:14.454 --> 19:16.256
No, it's really--it's okay.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.258
Um, I know that Jim had, like,
a crush on me

19:18.291 --> 19:19.392
when he first started.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.594
But that was a long time ago,
so--

19:21.628 --> 19:25.232
It wasn't that long ago.
It was on the booze cruise.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.535
Jim had a crush on me
on the booze cruise,

19:28.568 --> 19:30.437
or he told you about it
on the booze cruise.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.840
Um...okay.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.909
Shut it, Michael.
I'm done.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.712
That's it, I'm out.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.618
Ready?
Yup.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.560
People are always coming to me.

19:53.593 --> 19:56.863
"Michael, I have a secret.
You're the only one I trust."

19:56.896 --> 20:01.234
No, thanks,
because keeping a secret

20:01.268 --> 20:04.003
can only lead to trouble.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.307
Like, I was watching Cinemax
last weekend, this movie.

20:07.340 --> 20:11.944
Portrait of a Prostitute.

20:11.978 --> 20:16.283
Something... Secrets of a--
More Secrets of a Call Girl.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.485
And the lead character, Shila,

20:18.518 --> 20:19.752
is framed for murder.

20:19.786 --> 20:24.991
Goes on the run, and winds up
working at a bordello in Malibu.

20:25.024 --> 20:28.395
I don't--I don't wanna
live like that.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.996
I like it here.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.999
I don't wanna be Shila.
I like being Michael Scott.
