WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:07.713
No-one?

00:07.880 --> 00:09.712
You can't think of anyone
who may have had issues

00:09.880 --> 00:11.473
with your fiancÃ©?

00:11.640 --> 00:15.077
- She's already told you.
- I asked her.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.953
Andreas had
a criminal record.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.231
You yourself have two priors
for prostitution.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.754
What difference does that make?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.673
I thought it was a mugging.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.639
No, the calibre of the firearm used,

00:28.840 --> 00:31.036
the location of
the entrance wound

00:31.200 --> 00:32.953
and the body being moved
post-mortem

00:33.120 --> 00:35.919
all indicate to us that
this was a professional job.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.879
What kind of jackpot
was he in, Destiny?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.918
I don't know.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.878
This could go very badly for you

00:43.040 --> 00:44.793
if you know something
you're not telling us.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.792
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Threatening her after she's...

00:46.960 --> 00:49.031
You need to cool off, pal.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.880
Look, we all want to catch
whoever did this.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.554
But right now we have a funeral
to get ready for.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.759
We can pick this up
another time.

01:09.960 --> 01:14.751
If you think of anything
in the meanwhile, call me.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.952
Sorry for your loss.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.920 --> 01:45.470
The car is going to
pick you up at noon, OK?

01:46.720 --> 01:49.952
And I, uh...I picked out a poem

01:50.120 --> 01:52.430
from that Rumi guy
that you like,

01:52.600 --> 01:54.956
so maybe Sophia can read it.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.158
Destiny...

02:02.240 --> 02:04.436
Nik and Bajram.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.996
Yeah?

02:07.160 --> 02:09.595
They were his best friends.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.077
Why haven't they stopped by?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.638
Miss me?

05:52.360 --> 05:54.238
Holy shit!

05:54.400 --> 05:56.073
We're, like, two away.

05:56.240 --> 05:57.799
- Play it again, play it again.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.673
Uh-oh.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.398
500,000 views.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.035
- I can't believe this.
- And the Tubey goes to...

06:14.200 --> 06:15.839
All I did was fall down.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.673
This is cool and all,
but we gotta monetise this.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.639
Movie rights, spin-offs,
talk shows, merchandising.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.360
- We're talking bank.
- Hey, Shelley.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.080
- Something just happened
in your room. -What?

06:26.280 --> 06:28.590
I don't know, but you better
come check it out.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.552
You did this?

06:46.760 --> 06:48.353
Well, it was a paint eater,

06:48.520 --> 06:50.239
but Aitor fronted me
some extra cannons of Rust-O

06:50.400 --> 06:52.835
'cause I ain't about
no toy shit.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.591
Course you're not.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.116
So, you like it?

06:59.280 --> 07:01.511
I love it.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.876
Made it down to the Keys
in record time.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.430
Checked out my boat.
You oughta see it.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.273
30-footer, twin Mercs,

07:08.440 --> 07:11.000
a walk-through
to the swim platform.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.876
I hosed off the pelican shit,
turned around and came back.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.673
Why?

07:16.840 --> 07:19.799
My ex used to tell me
that I should see a therapist.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.596
I have a habit of fucking up
the good things in my life.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.957
Took off when you asked
for my help.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.473
So now what?

07:31.680 --> 07:33.911
Well, I'm here to do
what needs to be done,

07:34.080 --> 07:35.719
only I gotta get paid.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.315
And the Roman Godfrey
gravy rain has been derailed.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.318
They owe you any back pay?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.194
Any other clients?

07:43.400 --> 07:44.993
Nada.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.072
I guess I could always start
selling my blood.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.960
No, no, no.
That would be a sinful waste.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.316
Isaac and Olivia's
lemonade stand?

07:54.760 --> 07:56.558
I have a better idea.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.440
I'm not asking you to say
a eulogy.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.273
I'm asking you to get
your stories straight

08:04.440 --> 08:06.113
and show up to the funeral

08:06.280 --> 08:07.919
for Destiny's sake.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.673
- Fuck that.
- No fucking way.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.156
The price she pays for getting
engaged to a rat bastard.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.232
If nobody comes,
she'll know something's wrong.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.995
- So?
- So?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.231
You know what she's like,
you know what she can do.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.437
If she gets suspicious,
she will not drop this, ever.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.711
A psychic who didn't have a clue
her fiancÃ© was fucking

08:23.880 --> 08:27.112
every Croat cooze
in the greater Pottstown area.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.715
I'm not exactly
terrified by her powers.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.349
It doesn't take a clairvoyant to
know something's wrong if you...

08:32.520 --> 08:34.591
Our hands are clean!

08:34.760 --> 08:37.195
So I don't give a jumping fuck
what she turns up.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.839
Bajram?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.273
Sophia and Destiny are close.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.238
Gonna let her go
to the funeral alone?

08:47.720 --> 08:51.600
Do not bring our families
into this, Peter.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.998
This is done.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.798
CabrÃ³n. This is una casa grande.

09:25.840 --> 09:29.231
Oh, I knew you were rich,
but, shit.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.030
Actually, I was born rich,
then got really poor,

09:33.200 --> 09:36.034
and then I got really rich,
and then poor again.

09:36.200 --> 09:40.274
Yeah, that's just like me
except without the rich parts.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.358
My family.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.152
- Who is it?
- Shh.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.198
He takes care
of the place.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.479
Missed opportunity.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.600
Peeing outdoors is one of the
great pleasures in a man's life.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.632
Shh.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.759
If he catches us trespassing,
he'll call the police.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.469
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.632
We need to talk.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.911
About your mother
slipping me information?

10:52.920 --> 10:56.231
Yes, Roman.
I need to apologise for that.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.359
- Yeah. Why the fuck...
- She was blackmailing me.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.035
And, quite frankly,
I was not thinking clearly.

11:02.200 --> 11:06.160
There were some...emotional
issues I needed to address.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.599
- You should have told me.
- Without question.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.559
But you, Roman, also should have
been sharing with me.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.393
From the very start.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.155
I understand your instincts -
she's your baby after all -

11:17.360 --> 11:19.033
but from now on
we need to work together.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.436
Well, we gotta do something.
She's never gonna stop.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.160
Actually, we don't
have to do anything

11:24.320 --> 11:26.152
because she is going to stop.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.797
Your mother has the LoPS cancer.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.032
She's getting sicker every day.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.919
She will deteriorate

11:35.080 --> 11:36.673
and become hideous.

11:36.880 --> 11:41.511
A monster, really,
or...or more of one.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.519
Judging from the neural plaque
we observed during that autopsy,

11:44.720 --> 11:46.837
her mind will be the first
to go, precipitously,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.832
and the pain...

11:51.720 --> 11:54.554
Let's just say
death will be a relief for her.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.633
- How long?
- A month.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.678
Less.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.672
This disease is Terra nova
for everyone.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.592
- That's one less problem.
- Eventually.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.673
But if you prefer your organs
on the inside of your body,

12:07.840 --> 12:09.513
I would suggest
that you steer clear

12:09.680 --> 12:12.752
as the disease moves into
its final stages.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.350
She's already begun hunting
your kind.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.758
Why is no-one here?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.479
People are here.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.597
It was just short notice.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.433
Where are his friends?

13:08.840 --> 13:10.672
Are you ready?

13:27.080 --> 13:28.878
Andreas was a dreamer.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.074
His dream was to make everyone
around him happy...

13:37.000 --> 13:38.957
..especially Destiny...

13:41.160 --> 13:43.356
..who he loved very much.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.352
In their short time together,

13:50.520 --> 13:52.955
he looked after her
and she looked after him.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.113
And all he wanted
was to look after her

13:56.280 --> 13:58.078
for the rest of their lives.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.878
Andreas...

14:02.360 --> 14:04.272
..you were my friend.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.317
You were going to be my family.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.717
I'm so sorry to see you go.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.551
So you just keep pounding
till your hand gets sore

14:17.720 --> 14:19.393
and just when you think
you can't pound anymore,

14:19.560 --> 14:22.678
it goes soft, melts in your
mouth with a sweet, salty taste.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.439
Not in this mouth.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.718
You're gonna change your mind
once you've chowed down on mine

14:27.880 --> 14:30.714
'cause my conch fritters
are the toast of Duval Street.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.039
Hey, what you staring at?

14:35.200 --> 14:38.238
Got a problem with a brown man
kicking it with a white lady?

14:41.920 --> 14:45.550
Didn't think so.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.474
Would you relax?
You're imagining things.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.350
- Why was he staring?
- Because I'm not wearing a bra.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.312
Something wrong?

14:58.480 --> 15:00.437
I mean, with us -
did I do something?

15:00.600 --> 15:04.389
No. I have to work
some things out.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.312
We're gonna get through this.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.875
Um...

15:25.040 --> 15:26.838
Andreas really wanted
to have kids.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.640
He never stopped talking about
the babies.

15:29.800 --> 15:35.034
But...um...kids can be
a real pain, though, too.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.915
He died a hero.
Never forget that.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.231
What do you mean,
he died a hero?

15:53.920 --> 15:58.358
Just that in...the sense
that he was good...

15:59.360 --> 16:00.999
..man - he was a good man.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.039
In a heroic way.

16:05.760 --> 16:09.197
Good... ..man.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.392
It must be beautiful.

16:11.560 --> 16:15.190
It's not about village.
It's about sense of history.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.113
Excuse me.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.354
Hey. Everything alright?

16:21.520 --> 16:24.558
I want to be alone with Andreas.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.193
Ugh!

18:24.320 --> 18:28.234
Please...don't do this.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.039
I'll pay you,
I'll give you whatever.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.072
Task - pause, read back.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.275
Task - search all mentions
of Dr Deutsch.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.279
<i>33 mentions.</i>

18:51.480 --> 18:54.757
<i>- Shall I read them all?</i>
- No.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.511
Task - search state licensing
registries 1946 to present

19:06.680 --> 19:09.639
for 'Auschlander',
first initial 'R',

19:09.800 --> 19:11.598
physician or research scientist.

19:13.640 --> 19:17.998
<i>I have found
a Richard Auschlander. Retired 1993.</i>

19:18.160 --> 19:22.757
<i>Current address 67 Maple Drive,
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.</i>

19:34.840 --> 19:36.559
Story time. It's lunch.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.359
- We want a story.
- Yeah, man.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.079
Yeah, man. Let's hear something.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.397
Then a story you shall have.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.152
A story about...loving.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.997
There was a boy who fell deeply,

19:55.160 --> 19:57.880
passionately in love
with a girl.

19:58.040 --> 20:02.193
Certain natural processes
took place...

20:04.200 --> 20:08.592
..and she found herself
with child and yearned to marry.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.037
But the year was 1959

20:13.200 --> 20:15.715
and they lived
in the state of Virginia

20:15.880 --> 20:17.519
where it was against the law.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.991
He was white and she was black.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.799
So they went up
to our nation's capital

20:22.960 --> 20:25.077
to make her an honest woman.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.755
When they returned,

20:29.920 --> 20:33.516
they were arrested
because they were married.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.279
They were loving.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.113
Did they fight it?

20:38.280 --> 20:42.069
To the Supreme Court, June 1967.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.879
They won.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.829
That's why no-one can tell us
who to marry today

20:48.000 --> 20:49.639
because of loving -

20:49.800 --> 20:52.235
Mildred and Richard Loving.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.631
True story.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.918
Eight years later,

20:58.080 --> 21:00.037
a drunk driver hit their car.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.956
Richard was killed,

21:04.120 --> 21:05.918
Mildred lost an eye.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.718
She never remarried.

21:13.600 --> 21:17.389
I've spent a good deal of time
on my own...

21:19.000 --> 21:21.037
..separate and apart...

21:22.120 --> 21:24.396
..wondering if I was someone
worth loving.

21:25.800 --> 21:29.271
I'm pretty sure most of us felt
that way at one time or another.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.673
Then the other day
it occurred to me,

21:33.840 --> 21:37.072
maybe I'm the one
who needs to do the loving.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.638
And you know what?

21:43.280 --> 21:47.752
I haven't felt alone,
separate or apart since.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.236
Hey.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.112
Beautiful service.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.397
Very moving.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.479
I saw you speaking to Destiny
in the receiving line.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.712
Oh, yeah.
I never know what to say.

22:23.880 --> 22:29.512
You know, death being what it is
and so forth.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.514
"Oh, he's in a better place"
seems overused.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.118
I spoke to her
and she told me what you said.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.391
Seemed to really land with her.

22:44.560 --> 22:48.793
- In a good way.
- Yeah?

22:50.400 --> 22:54.280
Oh, well... Well, that's...

22:54.440 --> 22:56.159
That's great.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.357
To be honest,
I was a little worried.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.517
Yeah? About what?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.070
Eh, you know, just what I said.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.396
Really? It sounded good.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.914
Which part?

23:14.480 --> 23:16.472
Shit.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.280
Look, man,
I really don't have time...

23:19.440 --> 23:21.272
What did you tell her?

23:21.440 --> 23:23.159
I don't know.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.277
Just that he was a hero.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.272
- A hero?
- Yeah. I don't know.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.955
Something... That he died
a hero. That's it. That's it.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.713
We've been saying
that we don't know anything.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.519
- Now because of you,
she knows we're lying. -Shit.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.313
- I'm sorry.
- Oh. You're sorry?

23:35.480 --> 23:37.358
- Like that fucking matters now?!
- Alright, I'll fix it.

23:37.560 --> 23:41.031
- How? -I...I don't know. Just...
Alright, give me a minute.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.032
- I'll think of something.
- No, no. You don't do anything.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.873
You don't talk to anyone,
you don't do anything.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.838
Just...just don't.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.553
I don't know why
I'm poring over these files

23:59.720 --> 24:01.552
because nothing in them
is going to help us find

24:01.720 --> 24:03.359
your granddaughter...unless...

24:03.520 --> 24:05.352
Where's...where's the pendant?

24:06.640 --> 24:09.792
Chango. I left it right there.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.553
I don't know.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.479
Well, you saw me put it down
there, right?

24:13.680 --> 24:15.558
- I don't remember exactly.
- I remember.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.036
I...I left it right there.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.518
Oh, God. Somebody broke in.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.240
I don't see any signs
of forced entry.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.033
I am not imagining this!

24:28.200 --> 24:30.192
- Did you give anyone a key?
- No.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.676
Your daughter,
the guy that she's with.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.479
Isaac, I changed the locks.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.597
It's gotta be around here
someplace.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.837
I'll be right back.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.837
Hello, Dr Deutsch.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.233
Who...who are you?

25:18.400 --> 25:21.120
For our purposes, a man who just
injected naloxone into your IV.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.397
Hence, the immediate
withdrawal reaction

25:23.560 --> 25:27.634
and the resurgent pain caused
by your underlying condition,

25:27.800 --> 25:29.439
end-stage diabetes

25:29.600 --> 25:32.195
with gangrene of the lower
extremities, I gather.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.920
I apologise
for the inconvenience,

25:36.080 --> 25:37.719
but we need to talk.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.473
Who's Dr Deutsch?

25:39.680 --> 25:41.319
- I'm Richard Auschlander.
- Of course you are.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.551
When you were in Deutschland,
you were Deutsch,

25:43.720 --> 25:46.997
but now you are in Ausland,
so you are an Auslander.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.639
It's clever.

25:49.800 --> 25:53.396
I'm surprised you managed
to slip a pun by the OSS.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.597
What do you want?

25:55.760 --> 25:58.798
I don't care about your service
with Der FÃ¼hrer.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.679
After all, we're both
accomplished in our fields

26:00.840 --> 26:03.912
and understand that scientific
inquiry knows no partisanship.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.397
I need to find
one of our colleagues.

26:07.560 --> 26:11.315
You worked with him
in Plum Island after the war

26:11.480 --> 26:14.200
and knew him as Ryan Dunbrack.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.878
I don't remember.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.236
Then let me clear your mind.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.511
I hope you like roses.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.391
Please, Roman, don't do this...

26:53.560 --> 26:55.199
I don't know exactly why
you're pulling away,

26:55.360 --> 26:57.317
but I'm not gonna let you.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.598
What happened to that security
guard, that is not who I am.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.519
I was just trying
to protect you.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.315
- And however many Hail Marys I
have to say to... -

27:11.200 --> 27:12.998
You two know each other?

27:14.560 --> 27:16.358
Y...you know each other?

27:17.880 --> 27:20.793
This is my mother. This is who
I was warning you about.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.118
Annie, Ochoa.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.351
You don't have a life so
you're rooting around in mine.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.000
It's fucking pathetic.

27:37.960 --> 27:42.159
First Letha, now her?

27:42.320 --> 27:46.280
You're quite the stickman,
fucking two of your sisters.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.636
Only you can't put this one
on me.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.355
I haven't seen him
in 60 years.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.957
His interests, hobbies,
personal history,

28:16.120 --> 28:18.476
aliases,
locations he frequented.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.156
There was a town
in western Pennsylvania...

28:22.320 --> 28:25.472
Hemlock Grove. What for?

28:25.680 --> 28:27.672
I have no idea,

28:27.840 --> 28:32.039
other than he was as obsessed
with the place

28:32.200 --> 28:35.989
as he was about
the research he was doing.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.038
What kind of research?

28:38.200 --> 28:42.479
Weaponising an aggressive
neoplasm he'd isolated.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.439
- In rats.
- Yes.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.278
What else was he working on?

28:50.440 --> 28:53.194
Something about estuaries

28:53.360 --> 28:57.149
and water temperature,

28:57.320 --> 28:59.277
non-carbon morphology.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.239
For what purpose?

29:03.760 --> 29:05.956
I have no idea.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.271
Don't you find it
counterintuitive

29:08.440 --> 29:10.796
that necrotic tissue

29:10.960 --> 29:13.998
retains such a high degree
of nerve function?

29:14.160 --> 29:16.197
Uh! Ahh!

29:21.720 --> 29:23.791
I swear.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.031
I asked to see his data.

29:27.080 --> 29:30.073
I thought it...
it might be relevant

29:30.240 --> 29:32.516
to the work I was doing
with Von Verschuer,

29:32.680 --> 29:34.319
and he refused.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.312
The twin experiments.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.278
You're from Birkenau.

29:39.920 --> 29:43.391
Children.
You experimented on children.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.999
Children.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.675
They were going to be dead soon
anyway,

29:49.840 --> 29:55.234
and we gave them a better life
in the meantime - food.

29:55.400 --> 30:00.236
You infected them
so you could watch them die.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.831
You cut off their limbs
without anaesthesia,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.639
removed their sexual organs.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.315
- I was a scientist.
- A scientist?!

30:11.240 --> 30:13.038
You're a butcher.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.360
What...what are you doing?

30:19.520 --> 30:21.910
What does it matter?

30:25.840 --> 30:27.433
You're going to be dead soon,
anyway.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.278
It's good
you're eating again.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.079
It's not like I have to
worry about

30:55.240 --> 30:57.038
fitting into a wedding dress.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.960
You let me worry about getting
your money back, by the way.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.878
Thank you.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.919
I could use some
right about now.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.437
You guys seem like
you're doing OK.

31:13.440 --> 31:16.638
New flat screen, Lexus.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.031
Did Bajram hit the jackpot?

31:21.480 --> 31:24.234
He generally stays away
from talking about business.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.958
Sounds like Andreas.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.680
Me and Baj,

31:33.840 --> 31:36.196
it's all don't ask, don't tell.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.477
Still, you hear things, though,
right?

31:39.760 --> 31:41.991
If I got money coming to me
from his share of whatever,

31:42.160 --> 31:44.470
it would help if I knew
what they were up to.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.870
Something with the Croats
up in Pottstown.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.472
That's all I know.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.592
And you didn't hear it from me.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.111
Oh, Shelley.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.319
Oh!

32:25.480 --> 32:27.278
I've missed you so much.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.919
Hey. Where'd you go?

32:42.080 --> 32:44.356
- Are you OK?
- Where'd you find this?

32:44.560 --> 32:47.155
I didn't. I didn't even notice
it until you pointed it out.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.875
It was you - it was you
this whole time

32:50.040 --> 32:51.838
playing tricks on me,
gaslighting me.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.152
- I don't even know what that
means. -Do not fuck with me!

32:55.320 --> 32:57.915
Listen to me,
I can't help noticing

32:58.120 --> 32:59.759
that something's going on
with you.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.560
Whatever it is,
I just want to help.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.550
I've got cancer.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.992
It's in my body.
It's probably in my brain.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.152
It's all over my skin.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.677
That's why the guy downstairs
was staring at me.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.189
I'm losing it. I'm so scared.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.993
Show me.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.118
Show me what scares you.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.990
You don't want to see that.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.992
Try me.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.158
Does it hurt?

34:09.320 --> 34:11.277
Just to look at.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.033
My turn.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.438
Ouch.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.395
Compound fracture of the radius.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.552
Bone was sticking
right through the skin.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.473
Three broken ribs,

34:32.639 --> 34:35.951
and you can't see it
but cracked my skull open too.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.873
My God, what happened?

34:39.040 --> 34:41.509
Work related.

34:41.719 --> 34:44.076
Dispute with a client, actually.

34:44.239 --> 34:46.197
And what happened to the client?

34:46.360 --> 34:48.476
I let him live.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.312
I noticed that about you.
You have kind eyes.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.676
I get that a lot.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.398
Do you, now?

35:15.360 --> 35:17.158
Don't worry.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.475
Momma's gonna make it
all better.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.433
That is a no-no.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.552
Ladies first.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.992
So, I'm gonna come by
every morning

35:55.160 --> 35:56.992
after I drop off Charlie.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.839
- You really don't have to do
that. -Well, I'm gonna.

36:02.680 --> 36:05.434
- We're gonna get through this.
- I'm already doing better.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.638
'Bye.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.758
- I'll get you some sheets.
- I'm not sure I'm going to stay.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.230
I just want to talk about
some stuff.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.796
No, no.
Of course you're staying.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.031
She'll have to call the cops
before I give you back.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.590
I'm not talking about
going back to Mom's.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.797
I left there a week ago.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.318
You never told me.

37:09.320 --> 37:12.119
- Uh, I don't know...I was...
- She never told me.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.159
She fucking lost you
and she didn't tell me.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.596
Mom didn't lose me,
I left on my own.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.399
- Fucking cunt!
- Don't say that.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.120
- I hate that word.
- You're defending her?

37:22.280 --> 37:25.512
I'm not. I'm...I'm just
telling you what happened.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.439
You have no idea -
you have no fucking idea

37:27.640 --> 37:29.438
what she is and what she's done.

37:31.320 --> 37:34.597
I would fucking kill her,

37:34.760 --> 37:37.992
except she'll be rotting in hell
soon enough.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.958
What do you mean?

37:42.840 --> 37:44.797
She'll be out of our lives
for good.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.551
Why? Where is she going?

37:50.360 --> 37:52.431
Is she sick?

37:52.600 --> 37:55.069
Yessiree. As good as dead.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.074
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, Shelley.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.357
The shit that she did to you...
Jesus.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.274
She fucked you up worse than
what you look at in the mirror.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.915
What are you saying? I'm ugly?

38:07.080 --> 38:09.800
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Why are you talking like this?

38:09.960 --> 38:12.794
Because it's the fucking truth!
OK?

38:12.960 --> 38:16.476
You can hide in your pretty
poems all you want,

38:16.640 --> 38:19.439
but in the real world
people fuck each other over.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.115
They shit all over you.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.118
And if you're less shit on
and less fucked over,

38:24.320 --> 38:26.596
maybe you win.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.399
That's why I've done
everything I can -

38:28.560 --> 38:30.791
everything I can to protect you
from that...

38:32.080 --> 38:33.833
..death cunt.

38:38.200 --> 38:41.079
I wanted advice
from someone I trusted.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.152
This I could get from Mom.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.880
I made a mistake coming here.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.077
No, Shelley.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.197
You're not leaving.

38:55.320 --> 38:58.119
You don't get to tell me
what I can do.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.556
Neither does she.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.757
Now, out of my way.

39:14.609 --> 39:17.727
Blinsky,
research project.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.199
Amphibious breeding
in estuarine environments.

39:20.369 --> 39:22.964
Of course. And what specifically
about that topic?

39:23.169 --> 39:26.003
Everything - I want every study
done since 1946 summarised,

39:26.209 --> 39:27.802
plus, the names of
all the scientists involved,

39:28.009 --> 39:29.602
living or dead.

39:29.769 --> 39:33.763
Oh, and anything you can find
on sulfur-based life forms.

39:34.769 --> 39:37.603
Also...

39:37.809 --> 39:39.846
I want you to know
that I'm done with this.

39:42.809 --> 39:44.960
- You're quitting artificial stimulants?
- Responsibly.

39:45.129 --> 39:47.769
I've devised a detailed program
to wean myself

39:47.929 --> 39:50.000
by gradually titrating down
the dosages,

39:50.169 --> 39:53.162
thus avoiding the ravages
of abrupt withdrawal.

39:54.409 --> 39:56.207
May I say, sir, how pleased I am

39:56.409 --> 40:00.767
that you are saying yes
to a clean and sober life.

40:00.929 --> 40:02.648
There are no answers
in those pills, sir.

40:02.809 --> 40:04.528
Only pain and heartache
for you and for those...

40:04.689 --> 40:06.328
Blinsky.

40:06.489 --> 40:08.321
I can finish the research
by the end of the week.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.720
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

40:10.889 --> 40:12.528
First thing.

40:13.929 --> 40:15.807
Thank you, Blinsky.

40:21.209 --> 40:22.848
Oh, God.

40:29.249 --> 40:31.047
Another one?

40:37.649 --> 40:39.447
Haven't seen you in here before.

40:40.569 --> 40:43.721
Good to know someone's keeping
track of where I've never been.

40:45.329 --> 40:48.083
We don't get a lot of outsiders
coming through here.

40:49.449 --> 40:51.406
- That's the scoop.
- Really?

40:51.569 --> 40:54.129
Where would you be getting
this scoop?

40:55.129 --> 40:58.725
- Around.
- And your interest being?

41:01.209 --> 41:03.724
Exploring my Croatian roots.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.121
I hear a lot of bad boys
come in here.

41:08.129 --> 41:09.961
I love me some bad boys,

41:10.129 --> 41:12.200
especially when
they're my people.

41:13.729 --> 41:15.527
Well, you found the right place.

41:15.689 --> 41:17.487
Stick around.

41:30.849 --> 41:33.523
If the sun decided to be
a graffiti artist

41:33.689 --> 41:36.966
instead of the centre
of the solar system,

41:37.129 --> 41:39.564
I imagine it'd paint
something like this.

41:42.369 --> 41:44.440
Hard to understand
why it's against the law

41:44.609 --> 41:46.521
to make something so beautiful.

41:49.649 --> 41:51.720
I thought
maybe I scared you away.

41:52.729 --> 41:54.721
I scared myself.

41:58.529 --> 42:00.361
You OK?

42:03.129 --> 42:06.964
I guess I was just
wandering around,

42:07.129 --> 42:08.882
looking for some answers.

42:09.049 --> 42:11.405
Did you find any?

42:14.289 --> 42:16.360
Not really.

42:16.529 --> 42:20.887
Nothing that sounded
like the truth, anyway.

42:22.089 --> 42:24.558
The truth.

42:24.769 --> 42:27.079
There's an endangered species.

42:29.129 --> 42:31.803
But if you're searching
for truth,

42:31.969 --> 42:34.359
you need a lantern.

42:34.569 --> 42:36.367
Like Diogenes.

42:38.009 --> 42:39.807
Ever heard of Diogenes?

42:41.569 --> 42:43.401
Tell me about him.

42:57.089 --> 43:01.208
We begin our story back in the days
of Alexander the Great.

43:02.569 --> 43:05.084
Diogenes of Sinope,
who was to become

43:05.249 --> 43:08.799
one of the greatest philosophers
of the ancient world,

43:08.969 --> 43:10.562
begged for a living

43:10.769 --> 43:14.888
and often slept in a large
ceramic jar in the marketplace.

43:25.489 --> 43:27.606
No luck finding Mr Wrong?

43:27.769 --> 43:29.965
Uh, he probably would have
left me broken-hearted

43:30.129 --> 43:31.768
and pregnant, anyway.

43:31.929 --> 43:34.524
Trust me, you dodged a bullet.

43:37.489 --> 43:39.287
Get us the usual table,
alright?

44:12.329 --> 44:14.400
OK, time to have a little fun,
hey, girls?

44:22.649 --> 44:24.527
<i>It's Peter.
Leave a message.</i>

44:24.689 --> 44:27.966
Peter. Peter, he's here.

44:28.969 --> 44:30.688
The guy who killed Andreas
is here.

44:30.889 --> 44:33.848
Uh, at a restaurant
in Little Zagreb in Pottstown.

44:34.009 --> 44:37.480
Please, can you bring the guys?
Come. Hurry, please.

45:03.969 --> 45:06.006
Hey.

45:07.929 --> 45:09.682
I'm leaving town.

45:11.369 --> 45:13.247
The road out of here
is that way.

45:15.449 --> 45:18.283
OK. Um, I want to explain first.

45:18.449 --> 45:23.001
I owe it to you. Roman...please.

45:31.489 --> 45:33.606
I came here
looking for my mother.

45:33.769 --> 45:37.763
And I heard about you,
so I tracked you down.

45:37.929 --> 45:41.969
And when I saw you, I thought
you were probably, like me,

45:42.169 --> 45:43.762
born with the caul.

45:43.929 --> 45:45.568
I had to be certain.

45:45.729 --> 45:48.119
Well, you got your answer.

45:49.129 --> 45:50.848
And you had a million
opportunities to tell me

45:51.009 --> 45:52.602
what was up - you didn't.

45:52.809 --> 45:56.200
I know. I kept waiting
for the right time.

45:57.209 --> 46:00.008
- At the blood bank, I wasn't
thinking straight. -Bullshit!

46:01.129 --> 46:02.768
You picked me up at a bar

46:02.929 --> 46:04.602
wearing a little black
fuck-me dress.

46:04.769 --> 46:07.841
Couldn't tear your eyes away
from me getting my dick sucked.

46:08.009 --> 46:10.968
- Then you followed me home.
- OK, yeah.

46:11.129 --> 46:13.200
My feelings for you
are complicated, yes.

46:13.409 --> 46:15.560
Seems pretty fucking
straightforward to me.

46:17.529 --> 46:19.885
Or was that all just
a part of your grieving process

46:20.049 --> 46:21.847
for your dead husband and kid?

46:26.169 --> 46:28.047
Whatever happened
between you and Letha

46:28.209 --> 46:32.044
and then losing her like that,
and now Nadia...

46:32.209 --> 46:37.329
..I guess I thought you,
of all people,

46:37.489 --> 46:39.845
might find it in your heart
to forgive me.

46:45.289 --> 46:47.087
Forgive you for what?

46:48.569 --> 46:51.403
Being so thoughtless
and selfish.

46:54.889 --> 46:58.485
Please...Roman, I'm sorry.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.402
Is that it?

47:01.409 --> 47:03.002
Is that your apology?

47:03.209 --> 47:07.886
From the bottom of my heart,
please believe me.

47:08.089 --> 47:10.206
I mean, look at me.
I'm begging you...

47:10.369 --> 47:13.203
Enough!
My strong sense is begging.

47:13.369 --> 47:15.520
It's not what your mouth
does best.

47:17.529 --> 47:21.205
The way you talk about
our mother, her cruelty,

47:21.369 --> 47:23.167
is that where you get yours?

47:28.009 --> 47:30.843
It's a shame.

47:33.729 --> 47:35.641
It's a shame...

47:37.849 --> 47:39.681
It's a shame you're my sister

47:39.849 --> 47:41.806
'cause that was
some damn fine pussy.

47:44.049 --> 47:45.688
Is that what you want?

47:45.849 --> 47:47.727
Is that what it takes to earn
your forgiveness?

47:47.889 --> 47:50.882
- Letting you fuck me?
- It's a place to start.

47:52.769 --> 47:54.681
You arrogant, fucking prick!

48:14.609 --> 48:16.202
Arrgh!

49:42.049 --> 49:43.881
See you boys again
tomorrow.

49:45.449 --> 49:48.044
- 'Night.
- 'Bye, bro.

50:42.769 --> 50:44.886
Go wait in the car, alright?

51:31.729 --> 51:33.641
- Peter, it's him. It's him.
- Put it down.

51:33.809 --> 51:37.007
Put the knife down. Let it go.
Let it... Put it down.

51:37.169 --> 51:38.842
What the fuck?

51:39.969 --> 51:42.529
- Get in the car. Now!
- No, Peter, no.

51:45.169 --> 51:46.967
- You know him!
- No.

51:47.129 --> 51:48.802
Yes, he looked right at you!

51:48.969 --> 51:51.279
- Because you were going to knife
him. -He has Andreas's watch.

51:51.449 --> 51:53.486
- What watch? -The watch
I gave him a few days ago.

51:53.649 --> 51:55.322
You were gonna stab somebody
because of a watch

51:55.489 --> 51:57.162
that could've been
one of 100 watches?

51:57.329 --> 51:59.400
Why are you letting him
get away? I know it's him.

51:59.569 --> 52:01.208
- You're not thinking right.
- I know it's him.

52:01.369 --> 52:03.008
You were gonna get killed.
He could've killed you.

52:03.169 --> 52:04.808
- I can't lose you!
- I know it's him.

52:05.009 --> 52:07.843
So we get some of the guys
to do something. Call the cops.

52:08.009 --> 52:09.966
Fucking do something, Peter!

52:10.129 --> 52:13.486
I know it's him. I know.

52:13.689 --> 52:15.920
- You have to drop it. OK?
- We have to do something.

52:16.089 --> 52:18.046
Drop it.

52:54.889 --> 52:57.245
<i>Expect lows
in the mid-20s overnight.</i>

52:57.409 --> 52:59.048
<i>Now we have some breaking news.</i>

52:59.209 --> 53:00.882
<i>We've just received
news of another murder</i>

53:01.049 --> 53:02.688
<i>in Hemlock Grove.</i>

53:02.849 --> 53:05.318
<i>Daniel Garcia, 59, has been
found brutally murdered</i>

53:05.529 --> 53:07.122
<i>in the mansion
that was once the home</i>

53:07.289 --> 53:08.962
<i>of industrialist J.R. Godfrey.</i>

53:09.129 --> 53:10.768
Isaac?

53:10.929 --> 53:12.682
<i>Mr Garcia was a property
manager on the estate...</i>

54:28.529 --> 54:30.885
If you change your mind,
you can chow down on mine...

54:31.889 --> 54:35.803
..'cause my conch fritters
are the toast of Duval Street.

54:39.569 --> 54:41.162
What you staring at?

54:41.329 --> 54:43.924
Got a problem with a brown man
kicking it with a white lady?

54:44.129 --> 54:47.247
Actually, I was born rich,
then got really poor,

54:47.409 --> 54:50.447
and then got really rich
and then poor again.

54:50.609 --> 54:54.683
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
He can hear us.

54:58.409 --> 55:01.481
Ahh!

55:07.169 --> 55:09.764
What do I have to do
to make you stay?

55:09.929 --> 55:12.205
We'll see each other soon.

55:17.369 --> 55:19.042
Arrgh!

55:19.249 --> 55:22.048
Arrgh!

55:24.929 --> 55:26.648
Ahh!

55:28.569 --> 55:30.720
Ugh!

55:30.929 --> 55:32.966
Ohh!

56:28.289 --> 56:30.520
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

56:30.689 --> 56:32.760
<i>There's a man
on the sidewalk passed out.</i>

56:32.929 --> 56:35.205
<i>I don't think he's breathing.</i>

56:35.409 --> 56:37.048
<i>What's the address?</i>

56:37.209 --> 56:39.599
You recognise the voice?

56:39.769 --> 56:41.408
<i>The Nestor building
on Hope Road.</i>

56:41.569 --> 56:43.401
<i>I don't know the number.</i>

56:44.409 --> 56:47.322
<i>Paramedics are on their way.
Is the man injured?</i>

56:48.329 --> 56:51.003
<i>All I know is
he won't wake up.</i>

57:19.649 --> 57:21.481
It's not gonna get me.

57:21.649 --> 57:24.209
It's...it's...
it's trying to take my mind.

57:24.369 --> 57:26.804
No. No, no, no.
No, no, no fucking way.

57:26.969 --> 57:29.768
I am not the fucking disease!
It's not going to kill me.

57:29.929 --> 57:31.568
What you were gonna do
to Shelley,

57:31.729 --> 57:35.006
you're gonna do for me -
a body.

57:35.169 --> 57:39.686
A body. A body.
You're gonna stick me in it.

57:39.889 --> 57:43.360
No cancer, no fucking disease.

57:43.529 --> 57:47.205
I don't give a shit
how you do it, but you will.

57:47.369 --> 57:50.760
Or you'll end up in my closet...

57:52.369 --> 57:55.009
..like that other motherfucker.
