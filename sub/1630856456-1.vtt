- Yes.
- [man 3] Just like that.

Yes, exactly. Exactly.
That's what I've been saying.

you're doing? Whoa, man.

You're supposed to be warming up,

- How long should I be warming up?
- No idea. You need to ask fucking Benko.

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.892
- We've been waiting for an hour.
- [man 2] I know.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.291
But the ref says we're about to start.
Benko's arrived.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.750
So, stay warmed up, okay?
Cosi, don't overdo it with him, all right?

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:47.041
- You gonna finally pay me?
- If they delay anymore, we'll cancel.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.958

Hey, they're gonna miss the best part.

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:47.875
The best cake in the world, right?

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.166
- [woman] Leonie?
- Yeah.

- so I'd have room for the cake.
- [woman] Leonie!

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.875

I'm definitely coming, I promise.

00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:23.166
Paul swore to me I'd be getting a raise
five months ago.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.458
- Yeah?
- [Cosi] Yeah.

00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:27.041
I didn't even get the money
from the last fight.

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.416
I don't know about money stuff.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.666
- Can you not talk to Paul?
- [Octa] Look at this.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.250
ONION

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.458
What's that?

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.000
What do you mean, what is that?
It's a cat.

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:38.125
Why does it say "Onion"?

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:39.916
- 'Cause that's its name.
- Octa.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.833
- It's a present for Leonie.
- Come on, man, that raise is overdue. Hey!

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.291
I'll talk to Paul. Okay?

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:48.625
Seriously, do that.

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:50.125

- Just do it.
- [Octa] Yeah.

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:56.750

is Onion? Who came up with that?

- Hey. You have three more days to prepare.

you can get stuck in traffic

00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:32.958

00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:37.708
DEAR LEONIE,

"Dear Leonie."

00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:50.583
[mocking voice] "Dear Leonie."
A bit formal, isn't it?

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:53.166
What's so formal about it?

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.166
It's like when you say, "Dear."
It's like... really formal.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.750
Like, "Dear landlord, I can't pay
my rent." That's where you'd use it.

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:03.000
- [Octa] It's how you write in a card.
- Not one to your daughter.

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:05.625
What... Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing, man?

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:10.166
- Why can't I get this right?
- Because the fight is on her birthday.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.833
But that's not your fault.

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:13.416
Yeah, it's never my fault.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.875
- [Paul] Okay, it's that time again?
- Paul!

00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.166
No, no, no, no. Don't worry, no problem.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.583
Happy to do it. Listen up, here we go.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:26.583
Hey, no one who has a child at 19,
who still has to get along with his ex,

00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:28.416
whom he never
should have messed around with

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.000
because she's not a good fit for him,

00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:32.291
but he just wouldn't listen
to his best friend...

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:33.208
Leave it, Paul.

00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:36.451
[Paul]...who also wants to have a career
in sports can do all of it well, okay?

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.309
[Octa] I can't take too many shots.
I don't wanna show up all busted up.

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:43.208
- [Cosi] Hello? You're not gonna get hit.
- [Paul] No, no, I get it.

00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:46.291
I knew all along
you were scared shitless of fucking Benko.

00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:47.726
- Fuck you.
- Like the other losers.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.267
- Can you take him?
- I'll kick his ass.

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:50.434
- Convincing!
- I'll take him!

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:53.138
- If you don't want a black eye...
- I'll destroy that motherfucker!

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.291
- Kill that motherfucker!
- I'll beat his brains in!

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.833
- I'll pound him so fucking hard!
- Not my fucking car!

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.125
- Let's go.
- Can you pick up the cat for me?

00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:02.916
Can I do what?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.333
And the cake. No, forget it, I'll do that.

00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:08.291
Cat. At the animal shelter.
Present for Leonie.

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:11.083
Uh, Onion?

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:14.166
- That's not a cat's name.
- [Cosi snickers]

- Fuck you, guys.
- Octa, we're just bugging you, man.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.166
Yeah, right.
Ask me again if I want a black eye.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.041
- You ruined the moment.
- Ask me again if I want a black eye.

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:24.958
- Ask me again.
- The moment's ruined.

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:26.875
Just ask me again if I want a black eye.

00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.976
- Want a black eye?
- I'll destroy that motherfucker!

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.851
- Kill the bastard!
- Destroy that motherfucker!

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:33.083
Jesus, dude!

- Nice to meet you.
- I cannot wait for this.

And after, we'll all go out
and have a few drinks together.

- No, not "let's see."

I bet on this guy.

we gotta fucking celebrate after.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.250
[Chino] Trash him, Octavio!

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:24.166
- Calm down. Take it easy.
- I am calm. He got all up in my space.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.000
Calm down and get your fucking hands off!

00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:27.250
[Chino] Octavio Bergmann!

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:31.166
- Why do you bring idiots like that here?
- The guy's an old friend, all right?

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.625
Those guys are idiots.

00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:34.625
[hip-hop music playing in background]

00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:39.458
- [assistant] We ready finally?
- [Octa sighs]

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:41.666
[Cosi] Hurry up.

00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:44.125
Warm up a little bit more.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:45.708
[Paul] Okay, how's your pulse?

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:49.333
Okay, cool. You're dead.
Give me your watch. I need to sync it.

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:52.625
Okay. [sighs]

00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:58.291
All right.

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:01.735
We still have a few minutes.
Let's go and see the ref, okay?

00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:02.791
[Cosi] Okay.

00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:04.750
- See you in a bit.
- See you in a bit.

00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:10.000
[cell phone vibrates]

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.375
Hey, Mina. I'm just having
the bandages put on.

00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:23.795
- You haven't had the fight yet?
- [Octa] They pushed it back three times.

00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:25.155
Another fight has been moved up.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:28.083
- Why are you telling Leonie you'll come?
- I am coming.

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:30.208
You schedule a fight
on your daughter's birthday,

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:32.500
then you say you're going to be there,
and you're not?

00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:35.250
Don't you understand
that she's been waiting for you all day?

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:36.166
I'll be there.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.833
Leonie has hardly eaten anything today
because you promised her some stupid cake.

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.458
If you can't be bothered
to see your daughter, just say so.

00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:45.416
- Hey!
- [Mina] You're constantly late.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.208
Most times, you don't show up at all.

00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:49.166
The fight is only three rounds, okay?

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.416
[Mina] No way
are you gonna make it by 6:00.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.666
Then I'll be there at 7:00.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.375
[Mina] For three months,
we agreed you were gonna be here at 5:00.

00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:58.000
These kids all leave at 6:00
when their parents get here.

00:10:58.083 --> 00:10:59.166
You know what?

00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:01.666
I'm done with your shit.

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:03.875
[indistinct background chatter]

00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:06.333
- [cell phone chimes]
- I'm...

00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:21.291
[Paul clears throat]

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:25.541
So, how're you doing? Ready to go?

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:29.375
[Octa sighs]

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.208
I need to make it today.

00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:35.416
Okay.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.625
[Octa sighs]

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:40.166
Okay, Octa. Listen to me for a second.
Just listen to me for a second.

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:42.458
We need this fight.

00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:45.291
We need the money. All right?

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.500
After, I'll personally drive you
to Leonie. Okay?

00:11:52.083 --> 00:11:53.833
I'll race through the city at 200 clicks,

00:11:53.916 --> 00:11:56.833
then drive you guys
to the fucking moon if I have to, okay?

00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.500
But right now, you need to focus.
Big-time.

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:02.541
She hasn't eaten all day
because she's waiting for my cake.

00:12:03.708 --> 00:12:05.916
And you know whose fault that is,
don't you?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.958
You know exactly who we have to thank
for all this fucking bullshit.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.083
That ugly piece of shit motherfucker
out there.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.500
That's why you're gonna go out there

00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:18.333
and beat the living shit
out of that fucking prick Benko so badly

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:20.250
that he'll never be late
for anything again.

00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:21.458
[Cosi] Okay, guys.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:22.750
Here we go. Let's go.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.250
Yeah, man.

00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:27.625
[German hip-hop music playing]

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:29.166
Okay, remember your strategy.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.166
Stay on the defense.
Let him burn himself out.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.958
Once he's tired,
force him to the floor. Three points.

00:12:34.041 --> 00:12:36.166
Stay on defense
until he burns himself out,

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.375
then ground and pound.

00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:39.250
Force him to the floor. Got it?

00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:40.166
[Octa] Okay.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.250
[hip-hop music continues playing]

00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:57.791
[announcer] All right, Berlin.

00:12:57.875 --> 00:13:00.291
Are you ready
for the biggest fight of the day?

00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.583
- [man] Hey.
- [female voice] Call from Mina.

00:13:02.666 --> 00:13:03.750
[phone chimes]

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:04.833
Mina.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.083
It's me.

00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:08.625
- What? David, what do you want?
- Octavio, it's over.

00:13:09.208 --> 00:13:12.708
- It's not a good time. I gotta fight.
- Mina is filing for sole custody.

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.416
I'm representing her as her lawyer.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.000
You'll have the documents
in your mailbox tomorrow.

00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:22.541
You must know that legally, there are
more than enough reasons for this.

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:25.425
- What the fuck are you saying?
- [David] Leonie is in her room crying.

00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:28.083
- Shut the fuck up! That's my daughter.
- [Mina] Your daughter?

00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:31.625
How is she your daughter? Who's taken care
of her for seven fucking years?

00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:35.541
Get here by six o'clock or I'll make sure
you never see your daughter again.

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:37.458
- You have one hour.
- [phone chimes]

00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:44.916
[Cosi] Hey! Hey, where are you going?

00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:47.250
- Hey, what's going on?
- No idea.

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:48.458
What's happening?

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.500
[Velcro ripping]

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.916
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing, man? Huh?

00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:03.125
Don't fuck around. Get your ass
in the cage. Octa, man, what...

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.375
Listen, I understand
what you're going through.

00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:08.458
But we'll figure it out.
We'll find a solution.

00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:10.250
Hey! Listen to me. We'll find...

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:11.333
[Paul groans]

00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:17.333
Sorry.

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:21.416
Mina is gonna take Leonie away.

00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:26.958
Fuck.

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.291
Octa Bergmann, my man.
How the hell are you doing, tiger?

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:33.666
- [Octa] All good.
- [man] How's it going with your gym?

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.791
You're gonna rock this today. I know it.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.125
- Sting like a...
- Sorry, Rico. Not a good time.

00:14:38.208 --> 00:14:40.000
I got big money on you, Octa.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.625
Let's get ready to rumble!

00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:47.375
Don't be such a chickenshit.
Show a little initiative.

00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:48.375
I'm trying.

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:51.458
No, you're not. You just stand around
like some two-bit punk.

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:55.750
- Hey, Bergmann! Where you goin'?
- [Chino] Going somewhere?

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:58.458
- Bergmann!
- [Chino] What the hell are you doing?

00:14:58.541 --> 00:14:59.666
[Winkler] Get back here!

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.750
[Chino] Come on, people, move it. Go, go!

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.708
- Ladies, what the fuck?
- He's taking off.

00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:06.471
- [Winkler] You've got a fight!
- [Chino] We'll catch up to him. Go!

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.625
[Winkler] Get the car from the garage.
Bring him back.

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:11.708
This son of a bitch has to fight,
or we're all fucked!

00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:15.708
[dramatic electronic music playing]

00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:25.166
- [phone chimes]
- [female voice] Voice message from Leonie.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.290
[Leonie] Dad, you have to come.
Mom is really angry.

- [Mina] Leonie, put that phone away!
- [beep]

00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:30.125
Hey!

- [Octa] Sorry.

[indistinct chatter]

00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:40.434
- [woman] Hey!
- [man 1] Watch it!

00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:43.250

00:15:47.791 --> 00:15:50.416
[man] Hey! Hello? Hey, buddy!

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.208
- Hello?
- Drive, please. I'm in a hurry.

00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:55.083
Asshole, open up!

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:56.166
- Wiedeking?
- [knocking]

00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:58.041
- Hey!
- Yeah. Hurry, please.

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.625
You sure don't look
like your name's Wiedeking.

00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:01.583
Well, it is.

00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:03.125
- [driver] That's his name.
- Hello?

00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:04.708
[Winkler] Over there! The car!

00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:06.083
Dude, just drive.

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:10.291
- Hey, fatso. Open the door!
- All right, Mr. Wiedeking.

00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:12.291
- Buckle up, here we go.
- [Wiedeking] Hey!

00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:14.416
What do you want, assholes?

00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:21.708
- All right, the name's Ronny. Where to?
- Max Beer Street. Step on it.

00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:23.875
Yeah, I got the whole "hurry" all right.

00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.666
But I don't think
that's gonna happen during rush hour.

00:16:29.166 --> 00:16:31.166
[soft music playing]

00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:46.875
[line ringing]

00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:50.166
- Octa, man.
- What the fuck is going on?

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.958
- Things are fucked up.
- Nothing I can do about this traffic.

00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:55.458
You probably know
there's a major shitstorm going on here.

00:16:55.541 --> 00:16:57.708
- You just took off.
- I told you. I gotta get there.

00:16:57.791 --> 00:16:59.583
Relax. I'm doing the best I can.

00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:02.458
- Explain what the hell Mina's problem is.
- Ronny, I'm on the phone.

00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:04.041
Oh, s-sorry.

00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:05.333
Who's Ronny?

00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:08.791
So, who's this old friend of yours?
What kind of drugs is he on?

00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:11.958
- He lost his shit when I left just now.
- All right, listen.

00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:13.458
Since your opponent got here late,

00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:16.083
I can buy us a bit of time
before you get disqualified,

00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:18.875
but you have to absolutely come back
right fucking now!

00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:20.541
[distant chatter]

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:24.083
- [Octa] What's happening now?
- [Ronny] Prenzlauer Berg is happening.

00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:26.708
And this was supposed to be
my secret shortcut.

00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:28.625
Ronny, turn around.

00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:31.833
[Ronny] Let me first have a look
to see what'll be the best way.

00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:34.708
And the meter's still running
for Wiedeking.

00:17:35.208 --> 00:17:37.750
We'll let that jerk foot the bill, eh?
[chuckles]

00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:44.708
- [man 1] Whoa! Hey!
- [woman 1] What's he doing?

00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:46.976
- [man 2] What's going on?
- [woman 2] Watch it, asshole!

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.916
- [man 3] What's your problem?
- [Winkler] Hey!

00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:53.708
- [man 4] Hey!
- [Winkler] Hey, just hold up a minute!

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:55.791
Watch it! What are you doing?

00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:57.125
- Seriously!
- [man 5] Hey!

00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:05.416
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.500
[grunts]

00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:18.833
Wanna tell me
what the fuck your problem is?

00:18:18.916 --> 00:18:21.958
[Chino] There's no problem. Just get
your ass in the car and come with us.

00:18:28.916 --> 00:18:30.708
[inhales deeply]

00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:33.333
Don't hurt him.

00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:36.250
[man chuckles]

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.833
[grunting and groaning]

00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:51.333
Hey, careful! This guy has to fight today.
He still has to fight!

00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:52.916
- Hey!
- [groaning]

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.416

Get up and fight. Get in there!

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.500
[Octa groans loudly]

00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:12.250
Go on, fuck, get him!
Come on, come on, come on, hurry!

Let's go.

Not a good time. Can I call you back?

Why... why am I not allowed
to see Leonie today?

00:21:34.208 --> 00:21:36.375
Had a little fight with Mina,
but I'm working it out.

00:21:36.458 --> 00:21:40.500
Mina texted me that the party's canceled.
Sounds like more than a little fight.

00:21:40.583 --> 00:21:42.458
The boys from Gregor's. Now!

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.583
Take care of it.

00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:46.250

Don't worry about it, all right?

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:52.458

Look, I've done a little digging, okay?

00:22:08.916 --> 00:22:12.208
Uh, Chino, his brother,
all those other assholes.

00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:16.500
Got a betting ring.
But there's also some more serious shit.

00:22:16.583 --> 00:22:17.958
Was the fight rigged?

00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:20.875
- Yeah, it was rigged.
- [sniffs and sighs]

00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:23.708
Chino bet 75 G's on you,

00:22:23.791 --> 00:22:26.541
and fucking Benko was gonna go down
in the third round.

00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:30.125
We can still turn this shit show around
before you're disqualified.

00:22:30.208 --> 00:22:33.291
I'll figure it all out.
But you have to get here.

00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:35.000
No matter what, okay?

00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.541
I just knocked them all out.

00:22:38.041 --> 00:22:40.000

- Fuck! Fucking hell!

00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:50.250
- Can you not explain to Mina...
- Explain what?

00:22:50.333 --> 00:22:52.253
That I just beat the shit
out of a bunch of guys?

00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:55.041
That doesn't help me with custody.
Paul, get the fuck out of there!

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.500
Those people are dangerous.

00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:58.041
[Winkler] Hey! Over here!

00:22:58.125 --> 00:23:00.166

I told you I don't know anything
about the money stuff.

[Cosi] 20%, or I'm not doing
another single thing here.

00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:34.750

that's when I stopped helping them.

his own money on you.

straighten this fucking mess out.

We got money problems.

Major ones.

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:47.416
I just didn't wanna tell you
because I, uh...

01:00:49.208 --> 01:00:50.708
I wanted to fix it all myself.

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:55.875
Octa.

01:00:58.333 --> 01:00:59.791
It was my idea to rig the fight.

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:04.458
I'm so sorry, man. I, uh...

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:09.750
I thought it would be a quick
and easy way to get us some money.

01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:12.166
And... [inhales]

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:16.625
...you and Cosi and everyone else never
would have had to know anything about it.

01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:17.708
That's...

Yeah, well, anyway, I, uh... [inhales]

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.333
I wanted you to know everything,
so maybe you could trust me again.

01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:34.166
You can trust me, man.

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:39.500
I just wanted to make some fast money,

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:42.458
and then fucking Chino dragged me
into this somehow, okay?

01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:47.791
I'm sorry, dude.
If I could turn back the clock, I would.

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.250
It's okay.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yeah?

01:01:58.166 --> 01:01:59.166
Yeah.

01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:03.083
Okay, cool.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.500
Thanks, man.

01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:10.000
Any way I can help you?

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:13.291
Where are you right now?

01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:17.708
On your way to Leonie? Or, uh...
Or are you going to pick up the cat?

01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:19.041
[chuckles softly]

01:02:20.291 --> 01:02:21.375
[gun clicks]

01:02:24.291 --> 01:02:25.750
And, uh, by the way,

01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:29.083
you asked me for a good cat's name, right?

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.958
An ex-girlfriend of mine had a cat,
and you know what she called it?

01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:35.833
Onion.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.916
Yeah, I know. Sounds stupid, but...

01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:41.958
but also funny somehow, right?

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:48.291
I won't make it to Leonie today.

01:02:49.083 --> 01:02:50.083
Sorry, man.

01:02:50.916 --> 01:02:53.416
And, um, uh, where are you right now?

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.791
I'm at a buddy's house.
I'll get back to you later.

01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:59.713
- What are you talking about...
- [phone chimes]

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:19.666
[sighs softly]

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:23.000
- Have I always been such a mess?
- [mom] Huh?

01:03:25.041 --> 01:03:26.041
With Leonie.

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:28.833
I...

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:30.958
[Marco] You're scared.

01:03:32.666 --> 01:03:33.666
What?

01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:38.000
Suddenly, there's this tiny human
in your life

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:40.541
that you have to take care of,

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:43.125
that you're responsible for,
and what do you do?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You fuck up and you're unreliable.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.208
You let everyone down
that you're close to,

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:50.750
who you say you love,
and it's never your fault.

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:53.416
- The whole universe is always against you.
- [mom] Marco.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.642
[Marco] "I have this fight, tournament,
still some work to do at the boxing gym."

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.958
- He's trying.
- He's not trying. He's scared.

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:08.333
Scared of having nothing to offer.
Of being a shitty father.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.500
Of doing everything wrong.

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.625
So, he'd rather run away,

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:18.708
and abandon his child.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500
Leave her behind.

01:04:26.666 --> 01:04:27.541
Because in the end,

01:04:27.625 --> 01:04:30.458
he's trying to prevent her
from becoming just like he is.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:36.375
If you really want Leonie
to be better off,

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.916
then maybe you have to try
to do things differently with her

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.958
than the way things were done with you.

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:44.291
Then you won't run away.

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:48.166
Then you'll stick around
and clean up your mess.

01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:53.208
And be there for her, once and for all.

01:05:00.708 --> 01:05:01.708
[Octa sighs softly]

01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:04.041
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:05:07.416 --> 01:05:10.666
- Thank you.
- [mom] Do you wanna take something to eat?

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:13.416
We have a door, you know!

01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:18.583
[indistinct chatter]

01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:23.125
[soft beeping]

01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:29.583
[sighs]

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:31.166
[phone chimes]

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:33.416
- Call Paul.
- [female voice] Calling Paul.

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:35.625
- [phone chimes]
- Hey.

01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:40.541
- I'm going to the shelter after all.
- Animal shelter? At this time?

01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:44.125
[Octa] They told me they'd be there.
Maybe I'll keep the cat myself.

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:46.125
Okay, and... and when will you be there?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.875
- A couple of minutes.
- I'm gonna head over there now too.

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:51.750
- [phone chimes]
- [panting]

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:57.041
- [chime]
- [Octa] Call Rico.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.291
- [female voice] Calling Rico.
- [phone rings]

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:02.666
Octa.

01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:04.791
Please don't take this personally, okay?

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:08.041
- You know how these things go.
- I have an offer for your people.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.916
I'm listening.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.250
I know where Chino will be
in a few minutes.

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:13.375
Where?

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:16.250
How do I know
your people will leave me alone?

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:19.375
- They only want Chino.
- They almost just killed me.

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:23.083
- Well, you did ditch the fight, man.
- I didn't know the fight was rigged.

01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:24.833
Really, huh?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.458
All right, I'll deal with it.

01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:29.791
But now just tell me
where the fuck Chino is.

01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:30.875
He's not far.

01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:34.750
- I'll send you the address in ten minutes.
- Why...

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:36.833
[uptempo electronic music playing]

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:51.165
- [chime]
- [female voice] Text message from Cosima.

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:55.166
"Octa, I just saw Paul
with that jerk from the arena."

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.583
"Thought you should know."

01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:00.791
[soft beeping]

01:07:04.375 --> 01:07:05.375
[lock rattles]

01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:13.708
[Octa] Hey!

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:19.333
Open up!

01:07:19.416 --> 01:07:20.291
We're closed.

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.666
It's ten to six.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.583
[man] On your watch maybe.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.458
- What?
- On your watch maybe!

01:07:32.125 --> 01:07:33.250
I have a cat to pick up.

01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:36.000
Not today. We're closed.

01:07:36.083 --> 01:07:38.000
It'll only be two minutes. Come on.

01:07:40.416 --> 01:07:43.375
Sure. You know how long it usually takes
for a family to pick up a cat?

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:46.416
They look around.
They look again. They think about it.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.460
- They think some more.
- Do I look like a family?

01:07:49.458 --> 01:07:51.208
I don't know who else you've got with you.

01:07:51.291 --> 01:07:52.708
You can see I'm here by myself.

01:07:52.791 --> 01:07:55.591
If you pick up a cat now, that's gonna
leave me with tons of paperwork.

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:57.541
I'll have to clean up, put shit away.

01:07:57.625 --> 01:08:00.083
All that stuff.
I don't wanna do all that now.

01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:03.541
- Just open the fucking door!
- Tomorrow, I said. Thanks.

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:08.458
[thunder rumbles]

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:12.541
- [phone chimes]
- Call Rico.

01:08:13.208 --> 01:08:15.250
- [female voice] Calling Rico.
- [ringing tone]

01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:16.750
- [phone rings]
- So?

01:08:16.833 --> 01:08:18.041
8 Donau Street.

01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:20.750
- Animal shelter.
- Animal shelter?

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.500
- [Octa] When are you gonna be here?
- A few minutes.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Octa.

01:08:26.708 --> 01:08:29.791
I just gotta say it.
No cops or anything, right?

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:31.250
- Yeah, yeah.
- [phone chimes]

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.375
- [phone chimes]
- Call Berlin police.

01:08:34.958 --> 01:08:36.166
- [ringing tone]
- [grunts]

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.625
[female voice] Calling Berlin police.

01:08:40.375 --> 01:08:42.458
- [policeman] Berlin police department.
- [meows]

01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:44.750
This afternoon, a police car was rammed.

01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:48.541
I know who it was, and where they'll be
in the next few minutes.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.875
[policeman] Sir, we're gonna need names,
an address,

01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:52.750
and all the information you have.

01:08:52.833 --> 01:08:55.625
It's the animal shelter. 8 Donau Street.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:59.166
- [policeman] Okay, who am I speaking to?
- [man sighs]

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:01.000
[Octa] They're dangerous and armed.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.583
[policeman] Sir, where did you get
this information?

01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:05.416
Send as many cops as you can.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.416
[policeman] Sir, if you want us
to send over a patrol car, we will.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.083
But I need you to tell me where you got
this information. What is your...

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:14.666
One car is not enough. You're gonna need
an entire SWAT team.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.166
- You got that?
- [phone beeps]

01:09:20.083 --> 01:09:21.083
[sighs softly]

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:24.000
Hey.

01:09:24.083 --> 01:09:25.458
[soft music playing]

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.125
[smacks lips]

01:09:34.416 --> 01:09:35.833
[Onion meows plaintively]

01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:46.416
- [Onion purrs]
- [Octa] Is there a way out the back?

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.000
[softly] Yeah.

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:49.625
[car approaching]

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.500
[car door closes]

01:09:52.583 --> 01:09:53.583
Fuck off.

01:09:57.875 --> 01:09:58.875
[door opens]

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.291
- [man] Keep walking.
- [Paul] Don't do anything stupid!

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.455
- All right, I'm going.
- [man] Shut your damn mouth!

01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:16.500
- [man grunts]
- [Paul groans]

01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:22.125
Okay, just stay cool. Be sensible, dude.

01:10:22.666 --> 01:10:26.416
- [man] I told you to shut your mouth!
- [Paul groans] All right, all right!

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.260
Run and your buddy gets
a bullet in the head.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.125
Get over there.

01:10:38.583 --> 01:10:39.583
Go!

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:04.250
[snaps]

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.333
- [Chino grunts]
- [Octa groans]

01:11:10.416 --> 01:11:12.916
- I'm sorry, man.
- Shut your stupid fucking mouth!

01:11:14.916 --> 01:11:15.916
[Octa sighs]

01:11:17.416 --> 01:11:20.750
The two of you are my whores from now on.

01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:24.083
I know everything about your families,

01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:26.750
and if you actually give
a shit about them,

01:11:26.833 --> 01:11:31.958
then both of you will bend over for me
every fucking day from now on!

01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:36.208
Do you have any idea what Danica will do
to us if she doesn't get her money?

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:40.333
A couple of fights here and there
ain't gonna cover it!

01:11:40.416 --> 01:11:43.625
The three of us are in business
for all eternity,

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:46.958
and it's gonna stay that way
until I say so.

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.392
- Are we fucking clear?
- [gunshot]

01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:51.309
- [man 1] Weapon. They're shooting!
- [Chino] Go! Move your fucking asses!

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:53.083
Get over there. Fast!

01:11:53.166 --> 01:11:56.000
[man 2] Come on, get closer.
Chino's over there!

01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:00.083
Shoot!

01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:04.916
[gunfire continues]

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:06.250
[Chino] Kick the door in!

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.333
- [gunshots]
- [man 3] Shoot!

01:12:14.291 --> 01:12:15.333
Was that you?

01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:17.583
- [Octa] No.
- Huh? Did you fucking do this?

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.426
No. I've been trying
to get home for an hour.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.208
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- Relax.

01:12:21.291 --> 01:12:22.916
[sirens wailing]

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:24.750
[tires screech]

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.541
It's okay. Just stay calm, man.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:38.017
- [Octa] Chino, there's no point now.
- [Paul] It's all good.

01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:39.458
What the fuck am I gonna do?

01:12:39.541 --> 01:12:41.416
[Paul] Just stay calm, all right?

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.208
- Put down the gun.
- You fucked me over.

01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:45.091
- Put the gun down and just take off.
- Relax.

01:12:45.625 --> 01:12:47.185
- You fuck me over, Bergmann?
- No, man.

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.875
- Did you fuck me over?
- No, man.

01:12:48.958 --> 01:12:50.101
- [gunshot]
- [Paul] Fuck, man!

01:12:50.125 --> 01:12:52.000
Calm down, man. Calm down!

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:54.666
I don't wanna fucking calm down!

01:12:57.541 --> 01:13:01.166
- Hey!
- [Paul] Oh fuck! Fuck!

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.500
[Paul groans loudly]

01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:06.333
[groans again]

01:13:07.708 --> 01:13:09.375
Put the fucking gun down!

01:13:09.458 --> 01:13:10.833
- Hey!
- [groans]

01:13:11.916 --> 01:13:12.916
Stop.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.625
