WEBVTT

00:44.583 --> 00:46.416
DEAR

00:52.875 --> 00:53.875
Octa!

00:55.333 --> 00:56.916
DEAR LEONIE

01:08.083 --> 01:08.916
Octa!

01:24.333 --> 01:26.958
Yes, exactly.
But that's what I'm saying.

01:27.958 --> 01:28.916
Yes.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.666
Yes, exactly.

01:35.958 --> 01:38.208
Can we continue?
Or what aren't you paying me for?

01:38.291 --> 01:39.708
Come on now. Go, jab!

01:40.833 --> 01:41.666
One, two, three.

01:44.041 --> 01:45.291
-Sprawl!
-Yes.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.916
My guy's been warming up. Where are you?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.833
Good form today.
You might actually win this.

02:18.541 --> 02:21.250
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Whoa, man.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.416
You're supposed to warm up,
not burn up your energy.

02:24.958 --> 02:26.125
Oh, very funny.

02:27.375 --> 02:30.583
Fucker. Get hurt
and we might as well close up shop.

02:30.666 --> 02:34.291
-How much longer do I warm up?
-No idea. Don't ask me. Ask Benko.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.625
-We've been waiting for an hour.
-I know.

02:37.708 --> 02:40.291
The ref says we're about to start.
Benko is here.

02:40.375 --> 02:43.916
So stay warmed up, okay?
Cosi, don't go overboard with him.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.291
Will I get my money then?

02:45.375 --> 02:47.000
If they keep delaying, we'll cancel.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.958
What? No, we're not.

02:49.041 --> 02:50.291
I have to see Leonie.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.416
Octa, we need this fight, okay?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.625
I'll wait in the car. Hurry up!

03:05.458 --> 03:08.083
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE OPENING!

03:31.791 --> 03:33.500
-Hello.
-Hello, my lioness.

03:36.375 --> 03:37.458
When are you coming?

03:38.083 --> 03:42.125
Dad has to finish up at work.
I'll head over right after, okay?

03:42.208 --> 03:46.083
-The others are about to leave.
-What? But the best is still to come.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.875
The best cake in the world?

03:47.958 --> 03:49.166
-Leonie?
-Yes.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.791
I didn't eat to leave room for the cake.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.833
-Leonie!
-Wait until you see the other surprise.

03:57.625 --> 03:59.375
You're not coming, right?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.750
Of course I'm coming.

04:02.833 --> 04:06.291
For sure, I promise.
There's just a small delay here.

04:11.291 --> 04:12.750
Octa, listen to me.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.541
-Cosi.
-No, you're going to listen to me.

04:15.625 --> 04:18.416
Leonie, I'm coming. I promise.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.333
See you soon. What's up?

04:20.416 --> 04:23.916
-Paul promised me a raise five months ago.
-Yeah.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.583
Yeah. I didn't even get the money
from the last fight.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.416
I have no clue about the finances.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.666
-Please talk to Paul about it.
-Look.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.250
ONION

04:33.333 --> 04:34.583
What's that?

04:34.666 --> 04:38.125
-What do you mean? It's a cat.
-Why does it say "Onion"?

04:38.208 --> 04:39.583
-That's her name.
-Octa.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.250
It's a gift for Leonie.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.458
That raise is overdue.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.500
I'll talk to Paul, okay?

04:47.458 --> 04:48.416
Seriously.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.208
After the fight.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.541
-Actually do it.
-Yes.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.791
Who came up with that dumb name, "Onion"?
That's not a cat's name?

04:56.875 --> 04:58.083
The animal shelter.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.250
Getting better?

05:03.333 --> 05:05.541
'Cause you need that nonsense
in a fight, right?

05:05.625 --> 05:08.875
-Yeah, yeah.
-Hey. You have three more days to prepare.

05:09.375 --> 05:10.791
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.125
Yes. Okay, we're leaving now.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.708
All right. See you soon.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.416
Okay, ref says 15 minutes.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.083
Seriously, nearly an hour.

05:26.166 --> 05:28.833
Yeah, because that jerk doesn't get
that you can be stuck in traffic.

05:28.916 --> 05:30.541
SIXTY MINUTES

05:31.333 --> 05:32.958
Fucking Benko, man.

05:36.708 --> 05:37.583
DEAR LEONIE,

05:45.458 --> 05:46.708
"Dear Leonie."

05:47.833 --> 05:50.583
"Dear Leonie"! A bit formal, isn't it?

05:51.583 --> 05:53.166
What's formal about that?

05:53.250 --> 05:55.708
It's just formal. It's like "Dear…"

05:55.791 --> 06:00.083
You'd say, "Dear landlord…
Dear landlord, sorry I can't pay my rent."

06:00.166 --> 06:03.000
-That's how you start a card.
-But not to your daughter.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.708
What-- Hey! What are you doing, man?

06:07.375 --> 06:08.541
Why can't I get it right?

06:08.625 --> 06:11.833
Because the fight's on her birthday.
That's not your fault.

06:11.916 --> 06:13.458
Yeah, it's never my fault.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.875
-Okay. Here we go again?
-Hey, Paul…

06:16.958 --> 06:20.166
No, it's all good.
No problem. Happy to do it.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.583
Attention, here we go.

06:22.458 --> 06:26.583
Hey, no one who has a child at 19
has to somehow get along with his ex,

06:26.666 --> 06:29.625
whom he never should have been with
because she's not a good fit,

06:29.708 --> 06:31.750
but he wouldn't listen to his best friend…

06:31.833 --> 06:32.875
Leave it, Paul.

06:32.958 --> 06:36.083
…and who wants a sports career,
can get it all right, okay?

06:36.666 --> 06:39.208
I can't take too many hits,
or I can forget about the birthday.

06:39.291 --> 06:42.791
-Hello? You're not gonna get hit, okay?
-No, I get it.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.000
I suspected all along
that he's scared of fucking Benko.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.541
-Like all the other losers.
-Fuck you.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.458
-Can't you handle him?
-Of course I can!

06:49.541 --> 06:50.375
Convincing.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.916
Going to your daughter's
with a black eye?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.083
I'll destroy that fucker!

06:53.166 --> 06:54.541
-You'll destroy him?
-I will!

06:54.625 --> 06:57.833
-You won't get a fucking scratch.
-Whoa, hey! Don't do that.

06:57.916 --> 07:00.125
-Okay, guys, let's go!
-Can you pick up the cat for me?

07:02.083 --> 07:02.916
Can I do what?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.333
And the cake. No, I can do that myself.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.541
Cat. Animal shelter in Neukölln.
A present for Leonie.

07:10.541 --> 07:11.458
Onion?

07:12.416 --> 07:13.291
That's not a cat name.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.750
-Fuck you.
-Octa, we were just having a moment.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.000
-Yeah, right.
-You ruined the moment.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.916
-Ask again if I want a black eye.
-Too late. You ruined the moment.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.041
He ruined the moment.
Totally fucking ruined it. It's too…

07:25.125 --> 07:26.875
Ask me again if I want a black eye.

07:26.958 --> 07:28.916
-Do you want a black eye?
-I'll destroy him!

07:29.000 --> 07:30.083
You'll destroy that fucker!

07:30.166 --> 07:34.125
Whoa, dude! How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

07:37.625 --> 07:40.041
-I sent you the address.
-Yeah, I'll do it.

07:51.291 --> 07:53.291
Hey. Come here.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.333
Come here. Come here for a picture.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.875
We need to say hello quickly.

08:17.625 --> 08:21.416
Hey, there he is!
Octavio fucking Bergmann.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.541
I'm so excited to finally meet you.

08:24.208 --> 08:27.166
-Octa, Cosi. Chino Winkler, his brother.
-Pleasure.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.208
I can hardly wait.

08:28.291 --> 08:31.291
Afterward, we'll all go
and have a nice drink together.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.416
Yeah, we'll see.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.750
No, not "we'll see." We will have a drink.

08:34.833 --> 08:38.041
I bet on him, right?
If I bet on him, we celebrate.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.458
Let him fight first.

08:40.416 --> 08:42.666
-Bad mood?
-No, the mood is great.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.208
Well, tell his face that.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.125
Go get warmed up.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.375
You got this, big guy.

09:04.458 --> 09:07.625
Show that jerk that we fuck in Berlin.
We don't jerk off.

09:08.291 --> 09:09.333
What's up with you?

09:10.083 --> 09:11.333
Why would anything be up?

09:11.416 --> 09:16.291
-Why are you standing so close to me?
-Wow! Adrenaline! I love it. Adrenaline.

09:16.375 --> 09:19.291
-Let him pass through.
-What's up with you?

09:19.375 --> 09:21.250
Destroy him, Octavio!

09:21.333 --> 09:24.208
-Just calm down.
-I am calm. He got too close.

09:24.291 --> 09:27.625
-That makes me nervous. Hands off!
-Hey! Trash that fucker!

09:27.708 --> 09:31.166
-Why did you bring these idiots backstage?
-Sorry, the guy's an old friend.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.000
What's with these idiots, dude?

09:37.541 --> 09:38.750
Ready to go?

09:40.666 --> 09:41.666
Hurry up.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.125
And you warm up a bit more, okay?

09:44.208 --> 09:46.333
Okay, how is your pulse?

09:46.416 --> 09:49.250
Cool, you're dead.
Give me your watch. I need to sync it.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.583
We still have a few minutes.
Let's go see the ref.

10:01.666 --> 10:02.666
Okay.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.750
-See you, okay?
-See you.

10:18.291 --> 10:20.416
Hey, Mina. I'm having the bandages put on.

10:20.916 --> 10:22.250
The fight isn't over?

10:22.333 --> 10:25.125
They delayed it three times.
Another fight was moved up.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.583
Then why did you tell Leonie you'll come?

10:27.666 --> 10:28.500
I'm coming.

10:28.583 --> 10:32.500
You schedule a fight on her birthday
and then tell her you'll come?

10:32.583 --> 10:35.208
Don't you understand
that she'll be waiting all day for you?

10:35.291 --> 10:36.166
I'll be there soon.

10:36.250 --> 10:39.833
Leonie has hardly eaten anything
because you promised her a damn cake.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.458
If you don't want to see her, just say so.

10:44.708 --> 10:47.208
Why else do you always show up late
or not at all?

10:47.291 --> 10:49.166
The fight is only three rounds, okay?

10:49.250 --> 10:51.541
You'll never make it by six o'clock.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.166
Then I'll be there at seven.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.375
For three months,
we've agreed you'd be here at five.

10:55.458 --> 10:58.000
The kids leave at six,
and then your parents come over.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.291
You know what?

11:00.458 --> 11:01.666
I'm done with this.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.625
I…

11:23.916 --> 11:25.583
How's it going? Ready to go?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.416
I need to make it today.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.583
Okay, Octa.
Listen to me for a second, yeah?

11:41.375 --> 11:42.916
We need this fight.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.375
We need the money.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.958
Afterward, I'll personally
drive you to Leonie.

11:52.125 --> 11:56.083
I'll race through the city at 120 mph.
I'll drive you to the moon and beyond.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.458
But now you need to function, please.

11:59.541 --> 12:02.541
She hasn't eaten all day
because she's waiting for my cake.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.916
You know whose fault that is, right?

12:06.000 --> 12:10.625
You know exactly who we have to thank
for all this fucking bullshit.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.666
That ugly little fucker out there.

12:13.750 --> 12:18.333
And that's why you'll go out there
and beat up fucking Benko so badly

12:18.416 --> 12:20.250
that he'll never be late again.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.250
Okay, guys. Here we go.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.125
Yeah, man.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.250
Remember your strategy.
Stay on the defense.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.708
Let him burn out.
Once he's tired, force him down.

12:32.791 --> 12:34.166
Three points.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.208
Stay defensive, let him burn himself out,
and ground combat.

12:37.291 --> 12:38.500
Force him to the floor.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.666
All right, Berlin.

13:01.541 --> 13:02.541
Mina calling.

13:03.833 --> 13:04.708
Mina?

13:05.208 --> 13:06.125
It's me.

13:06.208 --> 13:08.625
-What? David, what do you want?
-It's over.

13:09.208 --> 13:12.958
-I can't right now. I've got a fight.
-Mina is filing for sole custody.

13:15.333 --> 13:19.083
I'm representing her as her lawyer.
You'll have the documents tomorrow.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.541
You know we have
enough legally relevant reasons by now.

13:22.625 --> 13:25.333
-You're talking fucking nonsense.
-Leonie is crying--

13:25.416 --> 13:28.166
-Shut up! She's my daughter!
-Your daughter?

13:28.250 --> 13:31.625
How so? Who's been taking care of her
for seven fucking years?

13:32.208 --> 13:33.500
Either you're here by six

13:33.583 --> 13:35.541
or I'll make sure
you never hurt my daughter again.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.208
You have one hour.

13:42.958 --> 13:44.500
Hey, what's going on?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.041
-Hey, what's going on now? What's up, man?
-No idea.

13:56.791 --> 13:58.000
What are you doing, man?

13:59.916 --> 14:03.125
Get your ass into that cage right now.
Octa, man!

14:03.208 --> 14:06.291
What? Listen to me.
I understand your situation, okay?

14:06.375 --> 14:08.500
But we'll find a solution.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.541
Hey, now listen to me! We'll find--

14:16.333 --> 14:17.208
Sorry.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.416
Mina wants to take Leonie away from me.

14:25.958 --> 14:26.958
Shit.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.291
Octa Bergmann, my man.
How are you doing, tiger?

14:31.375 --> 14:33.666
-All good.
-How's Paul? How's your gym?

14:33.750 --> 14:37.833
-I know you'll do great. "Sting like a--"
-Sorry, Rico. Not now.

14:37.916 --> 14:40.166
What? I placed a big bet on you, Octa.

14:43.708 --> 14:47.416
Don't always be such a chickenshit.
Show some initiative.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.375
I am.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.625
You're not.
You're standing around like an idiot.

14:52.875 --> 14:56.375
-Hey, Bergmann! Did you get lost? Hey?
-Where are you going?

14:56.458 --> 14:58.541
-Bergmann!
-What are you doing?

14:58.625 --> 14:59.666
Bergmann, come back!

14:59.750 --> 15:01.750
People, move it! Go!

15:01.833 --> 15:03.708
-Ladies, please?
-He's getting away!

15:03.791 --> 15:06.416
Three of you
go down to the car in the garage now!

15:06.500 --> 15:08.625
Bring him back! Go, no questions!

15:08.708 --> 15:11.708
The guy has to fight,
or we're all screwed!

15:23.208 --> 15:25.041
Voice message from Leonie.

15:25.125 --> 15:29.041
-Dad, you have to come. Mom is angry.
-Leonie, put that phone away.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.541
-Hey!
-Watch it!

15:39.583 --> 15:40.541
Easy, man.

15:47.791 --> 15:50.500
Hey! Hello? Hey, buddy!

15:51.250 --> 15:53.208
-Hello?
-Quick, please. I'm in a hurry.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.083
Asshole! Open up!

15:55.166 --> 15:56.125
Wiedeking?

15:56.208 --> 15:58.041
Yes. Quick, please.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.500
Well, you don't look like a Wiedeking.

16:00.583 --> 16:01.958
But that's my name.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.708
-He, on the other hand, does.
-There! The car!

16:05.291 --> 16:06.500
Dude, just drive.

16:06.583 --> 16:09.041
Hey, fatso! Open the door.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.291
Okay, Mr. Wiedeking.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.291
-Buckle up. Here we go.
-Hey!

16:13.625 --> 16:15.083
What do you want, assholes?

16:17.708 --> 16:21.708
-All right, I'm Ronny. Where to?
-Max-Beer-Straße. Quickly, please.

16:21.791 --> 16:23.875
I got the "quickly" part already,

16:23.958 --> 16:26.291
but that's difficult during rush hour.

16:47.958 --> 16:50.208
-Octa, man.
-What bullshit is that?

16:50.291 --> 16:52.833
-Yeah, it is.
-Nothing I can do. It's rush hour.

16:52.916 --> 16:55.958
But you can imagine the commotion here.
You just took off.

16:56.041 --> 16:57.791
I told you I wouldn't make it otherwise.

16:57.875 --> 17:01.083
No need to be so aggressive, okay?
I can't fly over it.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.583
Ronny, I'm on the phone.

17:02.666 --> 17:04.041
Oh, I see. Sorry.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.041
Who's Ronny?

17:05.541 --> 17:08.833
Who's your old acquaintance?
What kind of drugs is he on?

17:08.916 --> 17:11.916
-He was pretty aggressive when I left.
-Okay, listen.

17:12.541 --> 17:16.083
Since the others were late, I can buy
some time before you get disqualified.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.791
But to do that,
you have to please come back now--

17:21.125 --> 17:24.083
-What happened?
-Prenzlauer Berg is what happened.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.708
It was supposed
to be my alternative route.

17:27.666 --> 17:31.000
-Okay, Ronny. Turn around.
-First I need to look up which way to go.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.666
But the meter
is still running for Wiedeking.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.083
We'll let that jerk foot the bill.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.416
-Hey!
-Careful!

17:45.416 --> 17:47.625
-Ouch!
-Are you crazy or what?

17:47.708 --> 17:48.916
What an idiot!

17:52.291 --> 17:53.708
Hey, stop for a second!

17:54.208 --> 17:56.250
Hey, be careful. Jeez!

18:02.583 --> 18:03.666
What's he doing?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.416
What are you doing?

18:16.666 --> 18:18.833
Wanna tell me
what the fuck your problem is?

18:18.916 --> 18:21.958
There's no problem.
Just get in and come with us.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.250
Don't injure him.

18:48.250 --> 18:51.083
Careful! He still has to fight!

18:52.750 --> 18:54.416
What's up with you?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.416
Come on! Get up and fight!

18:57.416 --> 18:58.541
Get him!

19:09.250 --> 19:12.375
What are you doing over there?
Come on, get in!

19:13.458 --> 19:15.916
Get up! You fight like cunts!

19:16.000 --> 19:18.625
Move your lazy asses! Go on, fight!

19:19.458 --> 19:21.708
Come on, get up! Go and help him!

19:22.833 --> 19:25.333
Grab him! Come on, now!

19:27.250 --> 19:28.125
Good.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.458
Come on!

19:33.541 --> 19:34.375
Nice!

19:34.916 --> 19:37.208
Put him to sleep. Yeah, that's it.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.375
That's right.

19:40.458 --> 19:43.625
And now into the car, please.
He has a fight to fight.

19:45.708 --> 19:48.333
Careful with the rear seats! No scratches.

19:48.416 --> 19:50.375
You two are coming with me. Let's go!

19:52.000 --> 19:54.875
Okay. Go through there,
and then turn right.

19:54.958 --> 19:55.791
Go.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.083
Finally. Where's the car?

20:05.166 --> 20:06.041
Here.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.208
You have to change something.

20:32.875 --> 20:33.708
Open up!

21:09.791 --> 21:10.916
Yeah.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.083
Where are you right now?

21:22.791 --> 21:23.791
One second.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.375
Call from Mom.

21:28.708 --> 21:31.708
Not a good time right now.
Can I call you back?

21:31.791 --> 21:34.250
Why can't I see Leonie today?

21:34.333 --> 21:36.375
I'm arguing with Mina. I'm sorting it out.

21:36.458 --> 21:40.291
Mina just canceled on me by text.
That doesn't sound like an argument.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.583
The boys from Gregor's. Now!

21:43.541 --> 21:44.583
Take care of it!

21:44.666 --> 21:46.375
Tell me what's going on.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.125
Don't worry so much.

21:49.666 --> 21:52.458
I want to see my granddaughter
on her birthday, okay?

21:53.458 --> 21:55.541
-I'll call back later.
-Octavio, don't--

21:56.333 --> 21:57.416
Call Paul.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.458
Calling Paul.

21:59.458 --> 22:00.416
Octa.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.708
Paul. Who is Chino?

22:04.750 --> 22:08.000
Listen. I've done a bit of research, okay?

22:09.333 --> 22:12.166
Chino, his brother,
all those other assholes,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.500
they have a betting thing going,
but also more serious stuff.

22:16.583 --> 22:17.958
The fight was rigged?

22:18.625 --> 22:19.750
The fight was rigged.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.750
Chino bet 75,000 on you.

22:23.833 --> 22:26.458
You're supposed to knock out Benko
in round three.

22:27.125 --> 22:30.625
Until you're disqualified, we can still
turn it around. I'll sort it out for us.

22:30.708 --> 22:33.416
But we mustn't mess with them.

22:33.916 --> 22:35.166
No matter what, okay?

22:36.125 --> 22:37.416
I knocked them the fuck out.

22:38.208 --> 22:40.000
-Who did you knock out?
-All of them.

22:40.625 --> 22:41.875
-All of them?
-All of them!

22:45.000 --> 22:46.708
-I must be at Leonie's in 50 minutes.
-Fuck!

22:46.791 --> 22:50.250
-Can't you just explain to Mina that…
-And tell her what?

22:50.333 --> 22:53.333
That I snapped and beat up some guys?
That doesn't help me with custody.

22:53.416 --> 22:56.416
Paul, get the fuck out of there.
Those people are dangerous.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.041
Hey! Over here!

22:58.125 --> 23:00.291
Okay, Octa. Wait--

23:00.958 --> 23:02.416
Come on! Step on it!

23:05.916 --> 23:07.208
Go get him!

23:20.875 --> 23:22.333
Voice message to Cosima.

23:23.208 --> 23:25.083
Are you at the gym? I need your help.

23:25.666 --> 23:27.166
Sending voice message.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.666
-I have no idea…
-Hey. Go inside.

23:39.750 --> 23:40.750
-Octa, hey.
-Come.

23:49.875 --> 23:50.833
What's going on?

23:51.625 --> 23:53.000
I'm being chased.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.833
Bruno! Annika.

24:20.083 --> 24:23.458
-The cops will be here in a minute.
-Yeah? Fuck you.

25:16.875 --> 25:18.708
Hey. What the fuck is going on here?

25:19.958 --> 25:22.250
I have to get to Leonie.
Stop the fuckers for me.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.333
20%.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.083
I don't know about the finances, Cosi.

25:29.166 --> 25:31.291
20%, or I'm not doing anything.

25:31.375 --> 25:34.750
My landlord's been trying to kick me out
for six months. I need the money.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.416
Mina wants to strip custody from me.

25:55.000 --> 25:55.875
Shit.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.833
You'll pick up the cake for me.

25:59.916 --> 26:02.250
Max Beer Street, Pastry Guys.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.458
And bring it to Leonie. I'll talk to Paul.

26:06.458 --> 26:08.791
One, two, three.

26:33.000 --> 26:33.958
Fuck you!

26:35.458 --> 26:36.958
Move it, you rat!

27:02.083 --> 27:03.708
You little cunt!

27:06.375 --> 27:08.791
Come on! Go get that son of a bitch!

27:08.875 --> 27:10.291
After him!

27:12.166 --> 27:13.291
Go! Get in the car!

27:15.833 --> 27:17.375
Message from Cosima.

27:17.458 --> 27:19.500
"They are armed. Be careful."

27:20.750 --> 27:21.583
Hey!

27:30.708 --> 27:31.708
POLICE

27:44.000 --> 27:45.083
Don't fuck around.

27:48.541 --> 27:49.416
What's this?

27:50.375 --> 27:51.333
Be careful.

27:52.333 --> 27:53.375
What do they want?

27:57.125 --> 27:58.125
Hey, now!

27:58.833 --> 28:01.000
Are you crazy? What's this?

28:01.500 --> 28:03.500
-Don't you have eyes or what?
-Hey!

28:03.583 --> 28:05.500
Are you playing the fool? Want trouble?

28:05.583 --> 28:07.625
-What kind of show is this?
-Forget it, clowns.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.208
-What did you say?
-Clown.

28:09.791 --> 28:13.333
Okay, I'm done with being insulted.
Enough is enough.

28:13.416 --> 28:17.000
-Stop there. Stop right there.
-You can come with us right away, okay?

28:17.083 --> 28:18.833
-What?
-So I am your clown?

28:18.916 --> 28:20.000
-He was the one who--
-Wait.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.875
You wanted to mess with us.

28:21.958 --> 28:24.416
I had a question.
You didn't open the window.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.708
Go ahead and clear the road.
Nothing happened, after all.

28:27.791 --> 28:30.000
-Get in the car now.
-Why me? He was…

28:30.083 --> 28:31.916
Hey, do you think we're stupid?

28:32.000 --> 28:35.666
You can explain at the station what you
and your friends were planning to do here.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.291
-I don't have time right now.
-Take him.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.208
Get in. Come on, now.

28:41.291 --> 28:42.791
With or without handcuffs.

28:43.750 --> 28:44.708
Your choice.

28:46.541 --> 28:47.375
Let's go.

29:05.791 --> 29:07.375
How about buckling up, buddy?

29:13.125 --> 29:16.791
Squad car C12 on the way to the station.
Suspicious person on board.

29:17.333 --> 29:21.291
Insulting an official, maybe more.
We'll run all the tests on him.

29:22.125 --> 29:23.791
Which station are we going to?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.250
Are you a wise guy?

29:27.625 --> 29:28.625
The one at Alex?

29:29.541 --> 29:31.333
Why? Is that your favorite?

29:32.916 --> 29:33.791
Yes or no?

29:37.333 --> 29:39.750
-This isn't the way to Alex.
-Shut up back there!

29:41.916 --> 29:42.958
What did I do?

29:43.041 --> 29:45.208
Ever heard of road safety?

29:45.291 --> 29:47.916
-I'm the one who got hit.
-Section 315, criminal code.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Exactly.

29:50.291 --> 29:52.916
Can you please tell me
which station we're going to?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.791
Which one would you like to go to?

29:54.875 --> 29:58.750
Tell us, and we'll drive you there.
Should we stop at your grandma's?

29:58.833 --> 30:00.500
Message from Cosima.

30:00.583 --> 30:04.125
"I'm here. The cake hasn't been paid for.
My card got declined."

30:04.208 --> 30:05.250
Shit.

30:05.333 --> 30:06.958
"Hashtag raise."

30:08.416 --> 30:10.458
Reply to Cosima, "Shit. Fuck." Send?

30:10.541 --> 30:13.791
-No.
-Hey, do you have Tourette's or something?

30:14.458 --> 30:15.416
Shut your mouth.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.083
Here we go again, then?

30:17.166 --> 30:19.916
-Shut your fucking mouth, okay?
-Are you crazy?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.708
-Shut your fucking mouth!
-Insulting an officer.

30:22.791 --> 30:25.166
Section 185, criminal code.

30:48.916 --> 30:51.333
What the actual fuck is wrong with you?

31:01.833 --> 31:05.041
You're coming with me now.
Enough with the nonsense!

31:05.125 --> 31:09.291
I've been running around the fucking city!
You have no idea who you're messing with.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.291
I'm doing you a favor. Trust me.

31:16.916 --> 31:20.416
This is bigger than you think,
so don't fuck around now, okay?

31:31.583 --> 31:33.041
Get in!

32:13.708 --> 32:15.208
Call from unknown number.

32:16.541 --> 32:17.833
-Take call?
-No!

32:21.750 --> 32:23.583
Call from Paul. Take call?

32:23.666 --> 32:24.500
Yes!

32:25.000 --> 32:26.375
Octa, man. What's going on?

32:26.875 --> 32:28.833
Annika's in the hospital
with two broken ribs.

32:28.916 --> 32:30.708
Bruno's not doing well at all.

32:30.791 --> 32:32.291
But I've talked to Chino.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.291
-Yeah, and?
-I won't quote his exact words.

32:35.375 --> 32:39.750
-He wants you in the cage. Period.
-He loses no money if there is no fight.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.166
He does.
With an illegal bet, the money's gone.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.875
But he swore he wouldn't hurt you
if you came back.

32:45.958 --> 32:46.791
Yeah.

32:46.875 --> 32:48.416
Octa, man, let's--

32:59.375 --> 33:00.208
I'm listening.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.333
Voice message to Mina.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.333
Mina…

33:11.875 --> 33:13.500
Let's, um…

33:18.708 --> 33:20.875
I'm sorry. I have…

33:22.083 --> 33:24.125
That Leonie hasn't eaten. I have…

33:25.250 --> 33:28.166
I'm at the cake shop now.
I'll get the cake and…

33:36.333 --> 33:38.166
I am…

33:40.958 --> 33:42.416
I don't know what to say.

33:45.833 --> 33:47.083
Please don't do this.

33:49.541 --> 33:50.625
I'll be there soon.

33:51.958 --> 33:53.166
Send voice message.

33:53.250 --> 33:54.750
Sending voice message.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.666
-How's Annika?
-She'll be okay.

34:01.541 --> 34:03.750
Octa, you need to go to the police.

34:05.541 --> 34:07.125
-Is that your water?
-Yes.

34:09.416 --> 34:11.750
Can you at least tell me
who those guys are?

34:17.458 --> 34:18.416
The fight was rigged.

34:19.875 --> 34:20.958
Holy shit.

34:34.166 --> 34:35.166
We'll talk later.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.666
Last chance, Bergmann.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.625
Put that down,
come with us, and we'll handle it.

34:50.541 --> 34:51.833
Get out of my way.

34:51.916 --> 34:53.541
Stop running your mouth.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.833
Put that shit down
and get in the fucking car with me.

34:59.708 --> 35:00.541
Please.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.375
Octa!

35:59.458 --> 36:00.750
Hey! Octa.

36:02.416 --> 36:03.250
Octa!

36:11.583 --> 36:12.458
Fuck you.

37:06.333 --> 37:08.958
Paul said you could use some help.
Come on!

37:09.666 --> 37:10.541
Come on!

37:11.791 --> 37:12.958
Dude, Octa, come on!

37:18.833 --> 37:19.833
Coward!

37:24.125 --> 37:25.750
No, don't you die on me now.

37:25.833 --> 37:27.291
Voice message from Paul.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.708
Okay, they disqualified you.
Chino's money is gone.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.166
So is Benko's.
The fucker was part of it too.

37:37.291 --> 37:38.500
Paul called you?

37:39.083 --> 37:42.958
No, I called Paul. I wanted to know
why you ran away from the fight.

37:44.250 --> 37:45.916
What's going on with Mina this time?

37:47.208 --> 37:48.250
Long story.

37:49.333 --> 37:50.416
I've got time.

37:51.208 --> 37:53.750
Well, I don't. I have to get to Leonie.

37:54.458 --> 37:58.166
-Can you take me to the subway?
-Sure. Our club's right next to it.

38:11.708 --> 38:13.000
You can go through there.

38:22.833 --> 38:24.500
Thanks, Rico. I owe you one.

38:25.291 --> 38:28.250
-I'm sorry, kiddo.
-All good. It's not your fault.

38:37.166 --> 38:38.250
I really am sorry.

38:52.458 --> 38:54.666
Octavio, just do exactly as she says.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.416
Don't talk back.

38:57.541 --> 38:58.708
As a favor to me, okay?

39:58.333 --> 39:59.625
Who do you work for?

40:02.583 --> 40:05.916
No one. I'm self-employed.
I own a martial arts studio.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
What do you want?

40:09.125 --> 40:11.166
Octa, just tell them about Chino, man.

40:16.333 --> 40:17.166
Leave.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.041
No idea what this is about.

40:20.125 --> 40:21.750
-I've known him all my life.
-Leave!

40:25.125 --> 40:26.458
Rico, what's going on?

40:28.375 --> 40:29.541
What's going on here?

40:39.666 --> 40:42.791
-Who are you working for?
-Nobody. I'm working for nobody.

40:51.333 --> 40:53.291
I have no idea what this is about, man!

41:07.375 --> 41:09.333
Why didn't you go ahead with the fight?

41:11.750 --> 41:15.291
My ex wants to take my daughter away.
I can't let that happen.

41:25.041 --> 41:26.375
What's your daughter's name?

41:29.416 --> 41:30.958
Does she have a name?

41:33.208 --> 41:34.041
Leonie.

41:36.791 --> 41:37.791
Last name?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.083
Last name!

41:51.208 --> 41:52.291
Last name.

42:02.125 --> 42:03.250
Last name!

42:41.708 --> 42:45.166
Tell Danica I'm about to get him.
I almost had him, and then…

42:45.250 --> 42:47.875
-I'll get him. Tell her that.
-We have the athlete here.

42:47.958 --> 42:52.291
Come here and tell us how you're
paying back the 500,000 you gambled away.

42:53.625 --> 42:54.708
Is Danica there too?

42:54.791 --> 42:55.750
EMERGENCY NUMBER

42:55.833 --> 42:57.333
Planckstraße 8.

43:00.125 --> 43:01.875
-I'll be there in five minutes.
-Good.

43:17.333 --> 43:18.333
I'm sorry.

43:57.583 --> 43:58.958
Voice message for Paul.

43:59.041 --> 44:00.875
They want to ice Chino and me.

44:56.791 --> 44:58.541
Does anyone have a knife or scissors?

45:09.375 --> 45:10.583
Is that you?

45:16.375 --> 45:17.333
Do you have scissors?

45:19.666 --> 45:21.625
If you turn around, I can open them.

45:36.166 --> 45:37.041
Thanks.

45:43.916 --> 45:45.250
What the hell is that?

46:07.208 --> 46:08.250
Thanks.

46:21.916 --> 46:24.458
HUMMER RAMS POLICE!
CULPRITS GET AWAY

46:26.666 --> 46:27.833
Call from Leonie.

46:35.875 --> 46:39.166
Hey, my lioness.
Have you eaten anything yet?

46:40.166 --> 46:41.291
You're not coming.

46:42.083 --> 46:43.791
-Sure I'm coming.
-You're lying!

46:45.416 --> 46:47.958
Mom said you're not coming.

46:49.791 --> 46:51.958
I'm going to eat Mom's cake now.

46:52.041 --> 46:55.583
I will definitely be there.
Look, I'm already on the subway.

46:56.708 --> 46:58.666
I'll just pick up your gift on the way.

49:02.583 --> 49:04.583
-Where's the exit?
-I've been wondering for days.

49:04.666 --> 49:06.791
-Exit?
-Upstairs, through the bar.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.500
-Hey.
-Hey, what's going on with you?

51:54.166 --> 51:55.000
Come on!

54:06.166 --> 54:08.291
Disconnected from "Paul Cell."

54:34.375 --> 54:36.333
Shit, man. Okay, I'll get a doctor.

54:42.625 --> 54:43.500
I'll kill you.

54:51.166 --> 54:52.291
You tracked me.

54:58.333 --> 54:59.708
And told them where I was.

55:07.333 --> 55:08.166
Okay, listen.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.625
Look, when you took off earlier,

55:13.541 --> 55:16.416
I thought it would be best
if you just came back.

55:17.291 --> 55:19.291
And that's why I helped them, yes.

55:20.333 --> 55:23.958
But when they started messing with you,
I didn't want to help them anymore.

55:24.041 --> 55:27.875
But then, unfortunately, it was too late.
They almost killed me.

55:30.041 --> 55:30.875
Paul.

55:35.125 --> 55:35.958
Run.

55:38.916 --> 55:40.041
Octa. Please, man.

55:45.083 --> 55:48.208
We could work with them. With Chino.

55:50.625 --> 55:53.625
Look, I'm starting
to figure this shit out, okay?

55:53.708 --> 55:58.416
Chino didn't just bet his money on you
but also half a million for other people.

55:58.500 --> 56:01.708
Now only you
can straighten this fucking mess out.

56:01.791 --> 56:03.291
I'll get up in ten seconds.

56:04.208 --> 56:06.750
Dude, don't you get it?
Chino needs you, man.

56:07.416 --> 56:08.583
He needs us.

56:08.666 --> 56:11.208
He bet half a million on you
for some assholes.

56:11.291 --> 56:15.166
-The fucking gambling mafia.
-Only you can straighten it out.

56:15.250 --> 56:16.583
Don't you get that?

56:16.666 --> 56:18.250
They just tried to kill me.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.708
Okay, listen. If we work with Chino…

56:22.791 --> 56:26.416
-Shut your mouth.
-Some rigged fights, we rack up the dough.

56:31.791 --> 56:33.666
Run. Fuck off.

57:41.916 --> 57:43.333
Voice message from Paul.

57:43.416 --> 57:47.125
You have to forgive me, man.
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

58:40.541 --> 58:41.416
What happened?

58:41.916 --> 58:43.666
-A little accident.
-What kind?

58:43.750 --> 58:46.375
-What are you looking for?
-Where's the disinfectant?

58:56.958 --> 58:58.375
You need a doctor.

58:58.458 --> 59:00.000
Do you have painkillers?

59:01.000 --> 59:02.500
-I'll call an ambulance.
-No.

59:06.791 --> 59:07.958
What happened?

59:08.500 --> 59:09.416
It's all good.

59:23.458 --> 59:24.875
A scooter driver hit me.

59:26.541 --> 59:27.375
All good.

59:35.916 --> 59:37.041
Marco.

59:47.541 --> 59:48.791
Step aside, please.

59:54.625 --> 59:56.625
Octavio, talk to us.

59:57.750 --> 59:59.125
I'll rest for a minute.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Why no doctor?

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.833
I need to see Leonie.

01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:09.541
Like this?

01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:11.791
Yeah, I don't know. I…

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.916
Mina won't let you see Leonie like this.

01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:18.875
Paul calling.

01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:21.458
Take call?

01:00:25.833 --> 01:00:27.708
Be quiet for a sec. I have to take a call.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I fucked up.

01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:40.916
We have money problems.

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.125
Major ones.

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:47.333
I didn't tell you because I…

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:50.958
I wanted to fix it myself somehow.

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:55.791
Octa.

01:00:58.333 --> 01:00:59.791
It was my idea to rig the fight.

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:04.416
I'm so sorry, man. I…

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:09.625
I thought it would be an easy way
to get some money.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:11.750
And…

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:16.833
neither you nor Cosi,
no one would have ever known. That's why…

01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:21.083
Yeah, well. Anyway, I…

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:25.916
I just wanted you to know
so you'll trust me again.

01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:34.166
You can trust me, man.

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:42.416
I just wanted to make money quickly.
And then Chino dragged me into this, okay?

01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:47.875
I'm sorry.
If I could turn back the clock, I'd do it.

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.291
It's okay.

01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:57.041
Yeah?

01:01:58.208 --> 01:01:59.041
Yeah.

01:02:01.916 --> 01:02:03.083
Okay, cool.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.541
Thanks, man.

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.041
Can I help you?

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:13.125
Where are you?

01:02:14.416 --> 01:02:17.750
On your way to Leonie?
Or are you picking up the cat?

01:02:24.333 --> 01:02:25.625
Oh, by the way,

01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:29.041
you asked me for a cat name, right?

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.916
An ex of mine had a cat.
You know what it was called?

01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:35.666
Onion.

01:02:37.041 --> 01:02:39.000
Yeah, I know. Sounds stupid

01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:41.958
but also funny somehow, right?

01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:48.291
I won't make it to Leonie today.

01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.083
Sorry, man.

01:02:50.916 --> 01:02:53.541
And where are you right now?

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.791
I'm at a buddy's house.
I'll get back to you later.

01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:58.791
What? Why?

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:21.416
Have I always been such a mess?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.041
With Leonie.

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:28.750
That I…

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:30.958
You're scared.

01:03:32.666 --> 01:03:33.500
What?

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.875
There's this tiny human in your life

01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:40.333
that you have to take care of.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:43.125
For whom you're responsible.
And what do you do?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.083
You're unreliable. You fuck up.

01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:48.875
You let down those who need you,
whom you love.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.500
But it's not your fault. It's all unfair.

01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:53.541
-The whole damn universe is against you.
-Marco.

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:56.083
I got this fight, that tournament,
work to do in the boxing gym.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.458
He's trying.

01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.250
He's not a mess. He's scared.

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:08.333
Of having nothing to offer.
Of being a shitty father.

01:04:11.166 --> 01:04:12.500
Of doing everything wrong.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.500
So he runs away.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:18.833
And abandons his child.

01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:22.541
For way too long.

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:29.916
Because he's trying to prevent her
from becoming like him.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.583
If you want Leonie to be better off,

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:41.208
then you have to do things differently
than how you experienced them.

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:44.291
Then you don't run away.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.833
Then you'll get it together.

01:04:51.375 --> 01:04:53.208
And you'll finally be there for her.

01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:04.458
I'll be in touch again tomorrow.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.375
Thanks.

01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:10.666
Do you want to take some food?

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.416
We have a door!

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:32.458
Call Paul.

01:05:32.541 --> 01:05:33.416
Calling Paul.

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:40.541
-I'm going to the shelter after all.
-Really? Now?

01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:41.833
They're insisting on it.

01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:44.083
Maybe I'll keep the cat myself.

01:05:44.166 --> 01:05:46.125
Okay, and when will you be there?

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:50.041
-In a few minutes.
-Okay, I'll go there as well.

01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:57.041
Call Rico.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:58.125
Calling Rico.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.791
Octa. Please don't
take this personally, okay?

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:07.916
-You know how these things go.
-I have an offer for your people.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.916
I'm listening.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.250
I know where Chino will be soon.

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:13.375
Where?

01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:16.583
How do I know
your people will leave me alone?

01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:19.375
-They only want Chino.
-They almost killed me.

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:23.291
-Well, you ran away from the fight!
-I didn't know that it was rigged.

01:06:23.875 --> 01:06:24.875
Really, huh?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.791
Okay, I'll sort it out.
But please tell me where Chino is.

01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:30.791
In Neukölln.

01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:34.750
-I'll send you the address soon.
-Why--

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.041
Message from Cosima.

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:55.166
"Octa, I just saw Paul
with that scumbag from the arena."

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.791
"Thought you should know."

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:19.333
Open up!

01:07:19.416 --> 01:07:20.291
We're closed!

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.666
It's ten to six.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.583
Maybe on your watch.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.458
-What?
-Maybe on your watch!

01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:33.250
I'm picking up a cat.

01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.000
Not today. We're closed.

01:07:36.083 --> 01:07:38.083
It'll take two minutes, okay? Come on.

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:43.375
Sure. You know how long it takes a family
to pick up a cat?

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:45.458
They look around. Then they look again.

01:07:45.541 --> 01:07:48.375
-They fight. They make up.
-Do I look like a family to you?

01:07:49.583 --> 01:07:52.583
-I don't know who else is with you.
-You can see I'm alone!

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:57.541
If you pick up a cat now, I'll have to do
all the paperwork, clean up, tidy up.

01:07:57.625 --> 01:08:00.125
All that shit. I'm not in the mood.

01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:03.541
-You're going to open that door now.
-Tomorrow. Thanks.

01:08:11.916 --> 01:08:12.791
Call Rico.

01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:14.250
Calling Rico.

01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:18.041
-So?
-8 Donau Street.

01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:20.041
Animal shelter.

01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:22.541
-Animal shelter?
-How long will it take you?

01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:24.916
A few minutes.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Octa.

01:08:26.708 --> 01:08:29.791
Just so that it's clear,
no police and stuff.

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:31.000
Yeah.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.791
Call Berlin Police.

01:08:36.791 --> 01:08:38.333
Calling Berlin Police.

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:41.250
Berlin police department?

01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:44.750
This afternoon, a police car was rammed.

01:08:45.833 --> 01:08:47.791
I know who it was and where they'll be.

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:50.375
That means you have names?

01:08:50.458 --> 01:08:52.875
An address? Or what do you mean?

01:08:52.958 --> 01:08:55.875
The animal shelter. 8 Donau Street.

01:08:56.416 --> 01:08:58.416
Okay, who am I talking to?

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:01.166
They are dangerous and armed.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.583
And where did you get that information?

01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:05.583
Send as many people as possible.

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:10.291
Listen, if you tell us who you are
and where you got that information,

01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:12.083
we'll send a squad car--

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:15.583
No, you're not sending a squad car.
You're sending a SWAT team, okay?

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:24.083
Hey.

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:46.416
Is there a back exit?

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.000
Yeah.

01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:53.666
Fuck off.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.041
-Okay, I'm going.
-Shut the fuck up!

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.416
Don't do anything stupid.

01:10:20.291 --> 01:10:21.208
Just stay cool.

01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:22.333
Be reasonable.

01:10:22.416 --> 01:10:24.333
I told you to shut your fucking mouth!

01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:26.333
All right.

01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:31.208
Run, and I'll bash your buddy's skull in.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.041
Over there.

01:10:38.666 --> 01:10:39.500
Go!

01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:12.916
-I'm so sorry.
-Shut your fucking mouth, man!

01:11:17.416 --> 01:11:20.500
You two, you are my whores from now on.

01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:24.000
I know everything about your families.

01:11:24.083 --> 01:11:26.625
And if you give a shit about them,

01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:32.083
then you'll stick out your fucking asses
for me every day now voluntarily!

01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:34.875
Do you have any idea
what Danica will do to us

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:36.500
if she doesn't get her money?

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:40.291
A few fights won't cover that, man!

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:43.625
The three of us
are now in a business relationship.

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:48.291
And it won't end with one of you cunts,
even for one second--

01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:49.791
Fuck! They're shooting!

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.958
Up! Come on! Over there!

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:06.250
Kick the door in!

01:12:08.916 --> 01:12:09.916
Shoot!

01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:16.416
-Was that you? Huh?
-No.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:19.416
-Was that you?
-No! I just want to go home.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.208
-Why are you lying to me?
-Relax.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:35.250
Stay calm, Chino, okay? It's all good.

01:12:35.333 --> 01:12:37.958
-What am I supposed to do now?
-None of this helps.

01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:39.625
What am I supposed to do now? What?

01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:41.916
-Stay calm, okay?
-Put down the gun.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.041
-You fucked me over.
-Put the gun down and leave.

01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:46.583
Did you fuck me over, Bergmann?

01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:48.000
-No!
-Did you?

01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:49.541
-No, man!
-Come on.

01:12:49.625 --> 01:12:52.000
-Fuck, man!
-Calm down, man! Calm down.

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:54.666
I don't want to calm down anymore!

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:09.375
Come on. Put the gun away

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.333
Stop.

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:10.250
Police! Drop your weapons!

01:14:15.208 --> 01:14:16.666
Drop your weapons!

01:16:41.125 --> 01:16:42.083
Cosima.

01:17:06.208 --> 01:17:07.041
Cosima.

01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:09.500
Paul.

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:33.416
Octa, sorry.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.458
-I wanted to somehow--
-Shut your mouth.

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:51.750
-Why are you here?
-I followed Paul.

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.125
I knew something wasn't right.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.833
25%.

01:18:00.458 --> 01:18:01.625
Twenty-five what?

01:18:02.625 --> 01:18:03.875
Raise.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.208
What? Are you nuts?

01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:13.666
Octa, ambulance.

01:18:16.666 --> 01:18:17.916
Come on.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:28.041
Really?

01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:31.416
All good.

01:18:34.416 --> 01:18:35.375
Good luck.

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:38.041
Police.

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:19.250
Dad?

01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:22.125
Dad?

01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:25.375
Dad?

01:22:31.541 --> 01:22:34.333
-What's the matter?
-A little accident. All good.

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:39.000
Happy birthday.

01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:50.208
Have you eaten anything?

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:08.791
Are you coming in?

01:23:09.916 --> 01:23:12.458
In a moment. I…

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:16.000
I'm so comfy here.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:17.833
Really?

01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:21.291
Yeah.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:25.750
It's nice here.

01:23:28.166 --> 01:23:29.708
Stay with me a bit longer.

01:23:34.583 --> 01:23:36.208
Oh my. Who are you?

01:23:36.916 --> 01:23:38.208
Hello, you.

01:23:38.833 --> 01:23:41.416
Oh, you little sweetie. Come here.

01:23:54.041 --> 01:23:54.875
It's all right.

01:23:55.666 --> 01:23:56.833
-Mina, that--
-No.

01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:12.000
You little cutie.
