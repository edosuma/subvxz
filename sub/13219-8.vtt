SAM:
<i> Previously on</i> Aquarius...

00:06.607 --> 00:10.209
<i> Word was, one of Charlie's</i>
<i> whores up and disappeared.</i>

00:10.211 --> 00:11.410
<i> Everybody said Manson did it.</i>

00:11.412 --> 00:15.114
But, well, he got himself
a real uptown lawyer.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.215
I want you to look into Ken,

00:16.217 --> 00:17.850
<i> I think that he might have</i>
<i> done something illegal.</i>

00:17.852 --> 00:21.420
All I need is to meet some
folks in the music biz.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.655
<i> 'Cause that's where</i>
<i> I'm fully at now, my music.</i>

00:23.657 --> 00:27.993
Little Jimmy, I was fenced in
for a long time
with your daddy.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.294
I brought you something.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.030
(GRUNTING)

00:31.032 --> 00:32.898
Peace offering.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.203
Hey, uh, you got
the time?

00:38.205 --> 00:39.705
Yeah, sure.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.673
What does Manson
want with you?

00:41.675 --> 00:42.741
He was your client.

00:42.743 --> 00:43.308
Manson knows things.

00:43.310 --> 00:47.646
If he talks
to the wrong people,
we could lose everything.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.461
Rough night?

01:02.463 --> 01:05.631
(CHUCKLES) Rough morning,

01:06.233 --> 01:08.133
and it's barely 10:00.

01:08.135 --> 01:13.072
Somehow I managed
not to break out
the vodka yet, though.

01:13.074 --> 01:16.175
Pretend we're at brunch.
Tomato juice and hollandaise

01:16.177 --> 01:19.144
and who's got
the lowest handicap.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.914
I was on the phone
with Middendorf.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.782
Oh?
What'd he have to say?

01:23.784 --> 01:27.052
We were talking
about the direct-mail program.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.856
Oh, yes, hi. It's me.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.825
What'd he have to say
about the direct-mail?

01:32.827 --> 01:35.794
Well, you were right
to keep it going.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.062
It's raising enough
by itself now

01:37.064 --> 01:40.666
to cover operating costs
for the national committee.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.434
That's fantastic.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.870
Isn't it?

01:45.005 --> 01:47.539
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.443
That's why it's you.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.878
What is?

01:52.880 --> 01:57.683
California campaign finance
chair for Nixon.

01:57.852 --> 02:01.019
It's you, pal. (LAUGHS)

02:01.021 --> 02:02.688
My God, I don't even know
what to...

02:02.690 --> 02:07.893
Yes, you say yes.
And I say congratulations.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.762
(LAUGHS)

02:12.333 --> 02:15.000
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

02:17.138 --> 02:20.539
So why was it rough
this morning then?

02:20.541 --> 02:25.177
'Cause I wanted it to be me.
And, uh...

02:25.880 --> 02:27.646
'Cause of what's
coming next.

02:29.183 --> 02:32.518
They're gonna need
to look into us.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.454
Nixon's people.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.295
They're gonna go deep.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.429
Into both of us.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.566
Into the firm,
the whole damn thing.

02:47.568 --> 02:51.470
But once you told me
Manson was out,

02:51.472 --> 02:52.938
I took some steps.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.441
Padded the paychecks
of a couple slobs
at Missing Persons

02:56.443 --> 02:58.610
to call me
in case anyone asked

02:58.612 --> 03:00.379
about that poor girl's file.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.548
This morning, someone did.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.984
But not just any someone.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.053
Twenty years old,
long blonde hair,

03:08.055 --> 03:09.988
no tattoos, no birthmarks,

03:09.990 --> 03:11.590
smallpox vax on her hip.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.958
My wife's got
one of those.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.595
Try not to lose the plot
just yet, Dunphy.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.130
Last seen December '59

03:18.132 --> 03:21.967
in a red sequined A-line dress
and red pumps.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.435
Terrific.
You talk to youth squad?

03:23.437 --> 03:26.471
Youth squad, runaway unit,
vice, jail, morgue,

03:26.473 --> 03:29.474
nothing, nowhere.
No. No, no, no.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.342
We got a picture?

03:30.344 --> 03:32.744
We do not,
lost to the ages.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.712
We got prints?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.147
Vice does have prints.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.982
Fine, give me
my marching orders.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.885
Calling all PDs.
Check and see if they got

03:39.887 --> 03:41.853
a Jane Doe body dump
matches her description.

03:41.855 --> 03:45.490
Start with LA County,
then go to Ventura and Orange.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.459
Done. We know her name?

03:47.461 --> 03:49.995
Caroline, Caroline Beecher.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.698
So why are we working so hard
to find a hooker's

03:52.700 --> 03:54.099
been missing
for seven years?

03:54.101 --> 03:55.500
Because a guy
named Ken Karn

03:55.502 --> 03:58.270
and his friends
don't want us to.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.042
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

04:07.248 --> 04:10.015
Ah... You keep
carpet-bombing me

04:10.017 --> 04:10.749
with this garbage.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.418
-Is that a trick deck,
or what?
-(LAUGHS)

04:13.420 --> 04:14.620
I'll call.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.422
Settle down, Joey.
You in?

04:17.424 --> 04:18.624
Fold.

04:18.626 --> 04:19.825
Oh.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.460
Dunphy with the luck.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.328
Pick it up.

04:23.330 --> 04:26.164
DUNPHY:
That's right, come to daddy.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.234
You gonna let me pay you
for this this time?

04:29.236 --> 04:33.272
Ah, Ruthie does yours
when she does mine.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.439
She likes ironing.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.941
Plus, I owe you, buddy.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.942
For what?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.410
Being off the ball,

04:38.412 --> 04:39.578
your friend's daughter.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.713
Wasn't my finest hour.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.082
Mine either.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.350
(SIGHS) Yeah.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.818
I'll buy you breakfast.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.153
Sounds good.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.656
What happened to that girl,
anyway?

04:59.600 --> 05:03.502
The baby keeps moving around,
kicking Mary from the inside.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.005
Bet you weren't
expecting that, huh?

05:07.207 --> 05:10.409
A baby, Charlie's baby.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.110
Were you?

05:12.446 --> 05:15.547
I'm surprised it took
so long, is all.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.949
It'll be beautiful.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.484
You'll see.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.052
How do you know?

05:20.054 --> 05:23.655
'Cause I got one.
Just turned five.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.258
First found out about him,
it was a bit of a hang up,

05:26.260 --> 05:27.859
I'm not gonna lie.

05:28.295 --> 05:31.396
But now? It's all love, man.

05:31.398 --> 05:34.466
Charlie said it would be,
and it is. You'll see.

Oh, no, no.

I'm Elliot Hillman.
I produce music

05:48.749 --> 05:51.216
for Ham Chapel,
the record company.

05:51.218 --> 05:54.519
I was told, uh,
the writer lived here.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.955
I'm just trying
to find Charles Manson.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.657
Well, welcome.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.667
Sam?

06:11.105 --> 06:12.371
Hi.

06:13.474 --> 06:18.243
Thought we might do better
on neutral ground.

06:19.012 --> 06:22.514
I've been trying not to think
about how well I didn't behave

06:22.516 --> 06:24.416
last time I saw you.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.953
I said some incredibly
stupid things.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.456
I forgive you.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.525
In fact,
I forgive you in advance

06:33.527 --> 06:38.764
for anything you might ever
say or do again, ever.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.333
GRACE: You said
Manson was a pimp,

06:41.335 --> 06:42.667
and that one of his girls...

06:42.669 --> 06:43.468
Disappeared, yeah.

06:43.470 --> 06:46.037
But he didn't go to prison
for that.

06:46.306 --> 06:46.638
Why not?

06:46.640 --> 06:49.107
It's too hard to make a case
without a body,

06:49.109 --> 06:51.042
especially 'cause he had
a good lawyer.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.011
Ken's not good, he's great.

06:53.013 --> 06:56.782
Well, that begs the question,
what's a first-rate
lawyer doing

06:56.784 --> 06:59.217
representing
a third-rate pimp?

06:59.219 --> 07:02.087
There's no good answer
to that, is there?

07:02.089 --> 07:04.156
None that I can think of.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.158
(MUSIC PLAYING)

07:10.164 --> 07:15.066
Okay, how am I supposed to go
back to diner coffee
after this, huh?

07:15.068 --> 07:15.734
I learned from my dad.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.070
If there was
one thing he knew,
it was coffee.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.605
Might've been
the only thing.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.007
Well, he must've known
some things.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.208
I mean, he was
the big boss.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.010
(SCOFFS)
Before he died, he whacked,

07:25.012 --> 07:28.780
burned, or plowed the wife
of every friend he ever had.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.451
Left me on my own
to claw my way back up.

07:33.220 --> 07:38.123
Made it so I now have to share
with dizzy trim like Lucille.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.460
If I wanted a partner,
it wouldn't have been a woman.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.028
If I wanted it
to be a woman,

07:43.030 --> 07:45.230
it sure as hell
wouldn't have been her.

07:45.232 --> 07:48.633
Bikers, they could
help you with that.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.868
Satans could.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.269
As in that Roy guy?

07:51.271 --> 07:53.605
(SCOFFS) Yeah, you're funny.

07:53.740 --> 07:57.576
They've no history
with your dad, good or bad.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.111
They like money,
they know drugs,

08:00.113 --> 08:02.981
and I'm pretty sure
they never sleep.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.983
Be like having
your own army.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.619
You wouldn't have to share
with anybody.

So Butano and Kovic
are in business together.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.259

they start to wonder
what's in it for you?

Don't you have work to do?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.163
Yeah, actually, I do.

disappeared hooker.

feel about that?

She wants to see me.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.054
So? So. So maybe
she wants to see me,

08:43.056 --> 08:46.525
or maybe she wants me to think
that she wants to see me,

08:46.527 --> 08:48.226
so that I make it easy
for her, man.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.694

I walk in and I show up

08:49.696 --> 08:50.962

to kill you?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.599
(SCOFFS) I don't know.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.102
Maybe 'cause I talk to cops?

08:57.104 --> 08:58.703
Okay, and how is
blowing town

08:58.705 --> 09:01.740
gonna make you less
suspicious to Lucille?

09:03.243 --> 09:04.676

09:06.113 --> 09:08.880
Call Lucille, tell her
you're gonna see her,

09:08.882 --> 09:10.782
and then go see her, okay?
Trust me.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.952

You're not reliable.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.220
Oh, Dunphy
didn't take a towel
in there with him,

10:55.222 --> 10:58.857
-so enjoy the show.

SAM: Father Mack.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.765
Father Mack?

11:07.567 --> 11:08.433
Ah.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.236
The sergeant on the desk said
I should just walk back here

11:11.238 --> 11:14.005
and find you,
and here you are.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.106
Well, as long as you're
not here to talk

11:15.108 --> 11:19.110
about the state
of my eternal soul,
have a seat.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.478
Oh, I'm sure your mother
would like me

11:20.480 --> 11:22.547
to discuss your soul
with you, but...

11:22.549 --> 11:23.882
Yes, I'm sure she would.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.417
Yes, she would,

11:25.419 --> 11:27.819
but, no.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.621
Okay.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.222
I just...

11:32.826 --> 11:35.060
I want your opinion
on something.

11:35.062 --> 11:39.164
I'm concerned
about Father Rowe,

11:39.166 --> 11:40.832
our pastor.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.267
-I think you've met him.
-I have.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.468
I've had dinner with him
a few times,

11:43.470 --> 11:45.670
over at my mother's house.
He can sure

11:45.672 --> 11:48.173
put away
the Parker House rolls,
that guy.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.074
Hmm.

11:49.076 --> 11:49.841
What's your concern?

11:49.843 --> 11:52.711
On Mondays, I count
the parishioner donations.

11:52.713 --> 11:57.182
-Mmm-hmm.
-Uh... About $2,000
is the usual.

11:57.184 --> 11:57.615
Okay.

11:57.617 --> 12:00.085
But since the spring,
Father Rowe has asked me

12:00.087 --> 12:04.422
to set aside $500 each time
for him.

12:04.424 --> 12:04.856
$500 for what?

12:04.858 --> 12:09.027
I don't know.
He didn't say,
and I wouldn't ask.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.363
Uh... Well, here.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.500
Here.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.602
Okay? Can you see?

12:17.604 --> 12:19.738
Well, not as well
as I used to.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.706
(CHUCKLES) Me neither.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.476
-Here and here.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.412
He's written out the check
to cash,

12:27.414 --> 12:31.182
-and not mentioned it to me.
-Right.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.252
You think
I'm overreacting to this?

12:34.254 --> 12:38.223
Unfortunately, no,
I don't think you are,
actually.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.557
Oh.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.692
What do I do now?

12:40.694 --> 12:42.594
Well, you know what,
I'll give it to someone,

12:42.596 --> 12:43.962
someone the pastor
doesn't know,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.296
someone he won't recognize.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.531
But when they report,

12:46.533 --> 12:49.467
they'll give the information
back to you first?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.669
They'll talk to me,
I'll tell you,

12:51.671 --> 12:54.205
and we'll figure it out, okay?

12:54.374 --> 12:55.273
All right?

12:55.275 --> 12:56.608
-Okay.
-All right.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.475
Thanks, Sammy.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.544

You want some coffee?

I did my thing, right?

13:36.883 --> 13:41.019
I'm... I'm saying
we're taking a little break.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.093
You sounded so good.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.296
He's going. He's gone.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.565
Is he? He doesn't look
like he's leaving.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.267
You gonna tell me
what I know?

13:56.269 --> 13:57.735
Never, Charlie.

14:00.106 --> 14:03.441
There's a cop
in my head,

14:03.710 --> 14:07.245
distracting me,
stealing my thoughts,

14:07.247 --> 14:08.880
because of you.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.586
I know, I'm sorry.
What can I... Can I do?

14:14.588 --> 14:16.321
You can start

14:16.556 --> 14:21.226
by making the music man
happy so he stays.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.862
I don't care how.

14:25.232 --> 14:29.901
But if he goes,
I will care about that.

14:31.504 --> 14:35.506
It's just not the way
Charlie would normally
do this.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.441
Oh, sure. No, no, I...

14:36.443 --> 14:42.113
I didn't preamble myself.
I didn't give him... Wow.
(CHUCKLES)

14:42.115 --> 14:45.350
Any time to prepare.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.651
Well, yeah, but also...

14:46.653 --> 14:50.255
No, I get it.
You know, he's nervous.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.956
He's not nervous.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.293
He's not
your minstrel puppet.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.896
He can't just
turn the songs on,
like a light.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.664
-No.
-And why should he?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.566
You came to him.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.934
Yeah.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.504
You don't know who Charlie is,

15:06.506 --> 15:09.240
how he lives, what he thinks.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.810
Some people might say those
things should be in the songs.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.513
Old, plastic people.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.317
Are you like them?
Did you drive
all the way out here

15:19.319 --> 15:22.687
to find the same thing
you've always found?

15:22.689 --> 15:25.456
(CHUCKLES)
You walked on in
and told him,

15:25.458 --> 15:27.892
"Stand on a cliff for me,"

15:27.894 --> 15:28.793
and he did.

15:28.795 --> 15:31.930
Because he wanted to give you
what you needed.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.731
Giving someone what
they need is love.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.099
The music's only part of it.

15:35.101 --> 15:39.137
His love...is everything.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.275
Uh. (CHUCKLES)

15:47.881 --> 15:50.081
Sounds like I got this
all wrong.

15:51.918 --> 15:55.853
Something like this here,
immersing yourself,

15:55.855 --> 15:57.355
I wasn't prepared.

15:57.357 --> 16:01.426
I need to take a step back.

16:01.428 --> 16:01.859
No, what?

16:01.861 --> 16:03.561
What, hold on. No, no, no,
look, I was just...

16:03.563 --> 16:05.663
-Come on, I just...
-No, no, you just
made the case

16:05.665 --> 16:07.632
for Charlie, little lady.

16:07.701 --> 16:11.035
He should be happy someone
like you's got his back.

16:11.037 --> 16:11.536
Come on.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.870
-In fact...
-No, no, you stay.

16:12.872 --> 16:13.972
-No, in fact, I'll tell him...
-No, look, here.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.441
-I'll tell him
right before I go.
-You can... No, no, no, no...

17:44.998 --> 17:47.265
You got out.
You changed your life.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.633
Well, I didn't change it
so much that someone

17:48.635 --> 17:51.436
couldn't find me
if they really wanted to.

17:53.606 --> 17:58.776
Well, what about you?
You're still a cop, obviously.

Yup.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.599
would call me,
and occasionally did.

Since johns called me things?

Mmm-hmm.

18:27.006 --> 18:27.805
Four years.

a nurse?

Six.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.077
Uh, what, oh.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.179
Yeah, I didn't change it
all at once.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.215
I don't think it sticks
if you do it that way.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.784

21:20.079 --> 21:24.815
You know, we could
have closed the place,
had a private party.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.118
Notice from who? Me?

21:27.353 --> 21:28.853
Yeah, Jimmy.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.888
(CHUCKLES)

21:30.890 --> 21:32.990
Okay, listen up,

21:33.359 --> 21:37.361
these special guests,
they work for me now,

21:37.930 --> 21:40.231
doing whatever I need done.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.671
How's that for notice?
Good enough?

21:46.673 --> 21:48.606
(GLASS SHATTERING)

21:53.946 --> 21:58.282
Why don't we commemorate
our new arrangement

21:58.284 --> 21:59.850
with a toast?

22:01.621 --> 22:03.220
What'll you have?

22:04.524 --> 22:06.590
I'll take
one of everything.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.862
For all of California?

22:13.399 --> 22:15.199
That's incredible, my God.

22:15.201 --> 22:19.403
Which is why we need to settle
some things right now.

22:19.405 --> 22:20.838
What things?

22:21.007 --> 22:24.975
Dick Nixon is the only hope
this country has to rise up

22:24.977 --> 22:28.813
out of the political,
moral, hippie-coddling,

22:28.815 --> 22:31.849
war-torn quagmire it's in.

22:31.851 --> 22:37.588
He will vet me right down
to the nails in my shoes.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.989
And Hal.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.425
And you.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.661
And our daughter.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.798
I will do whatever it takes,
whether you like it or not,

22:47.800 --> 22:51.268
to see that Richard Nixon
is our next president.

22:51.270 --> 22:53.537
So here's what I'm gonna do,

22:53.773 --> 22:57.708
and when I'm through
telling you,

22:57.710 --> 23:00.177
I only want to hear
two words.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.080
Yes, dear.

23:25.905 --> 23:26.637
It's good to see you.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.472
There's lots of people here.
All I have to do is scream.

23:28.474 --> 23:32.076
I just want to tell you
something that you
want to hear.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.586
Those eyes.

23:44.190 --> 23:47.758
When you were a tiny baby,
you'd always study me.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.796
It... It was disconcerting.

23:51.798 --> 23:55.633
Such an old soul looking out
of that new face.

23:55.635 --> 24:00.204
And I should've remembered it,
how sure you've always been.

24:02.008 --> 24:05.009
Do you know what
emancipation is?

24:05.011 --> 24:05.409
Yes.

24:05.411 --> 24:09.747
Well, in this state,
if the parents don't oppose,

24:09.749 --> 24:13.250
a minor can self-emancipate,
just by moving out.

24:13.252 --> 24:17.154
You've done that.
We'd just make it official,

24:17.723 --> 24:19.557
set you legally free.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.296
This is what Mommy wants, too?

24:25.865 --> 24:27.298
Yeah.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.135
Just tell me.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.704
Tell you what?

24:33.706 --> 24:35.473
You and Charlie.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.975
I saw

24:37.977 --> 24:42.213
the way you looked
at each other, I saw.

24:44.116 --> 24:48.252
Tell me something real
for once, Daddy, please.

24:49.422 --> 24:54.992
I'll sign the papers and take
them to the probate clerk.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.362
And then we can
live our lives,

24:58.364 --> 25:00.998
and not hurt
each other anymore.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.572
Goodbye, Ken.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.093
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

25:40.006 --> 25:41.472
-Wow.
-Hey.

25:41.474 --> 25:43.307
Anybody needs
a blood transfusion,

25:43.309 --> 25:46.143

squeeze your eyes.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.078
Ah-ha. Coffee?

25:48.080 --> 25:50.281
No, I'm just gonna
tell you all I know,

25:50.283 --> 25:52.316
and I'm going home to bed.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.920
Oh. The priest thing already?

25:55.922 --> 25:56.453
That was quick.

25:56.455 --> 26:00.024
So Father Rowe, he officiated
two weddings yesterday.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.726
Then after that, I tailed him
to the parish house

26:02.728 --> 26:07.731
and sat outside without
incident till it got dark.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.633
<i> At which point,</i>
<i> he got in his car</i>

26:09.635 --> 26:12.870
<i> and went to that warehouse</i>
<i> on Cherokee.</i>

26:17.977 --> 26:19.476
SAM: <i> Warehouse?</i>

26:19.478 --> 26:21.512
Uh, Bob Ellery's place?

26:21.514 --> 26:25.549
Bob, he... He's gambling
at Bob the barber's?

26:25.551 --> 26:30.554
I went inside and had
a couple shots of rye
just to put eyes on him.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.465
SAM: So he's stealing
from the collection plate

26:41.467 --> 26:43.767
to play
high stakes poker?

26:43.769 --> 26:46.003
Mmm, could be putting down
his own money,

26:46.005 --> 26:48.906
but seems pretty unlikely
on a priest's salary,

26:48.908 --> 26:51.742
seeing the size of the pots
at Bob's.

26:53.813 --> 26:54.878
Yeah, gotta say,

26:54.880 --> 26:58.248
it was pretty sad watching him
sit at the table all night,

26:58.250 --> 27:01.752
betting on the flop,
knowing what I knew.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.389
You ever wonder
why we do it?

27:05.625 --> 27:07.024
Nope.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.927
But I know you do.

27:11.664 --> 27:15.899
And you should stop
doing that.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.203
You haven't told
anybody else?

27:19.205 --> 27:21.505
No, you asked me not to.
But this is grand theft,

27:21.507 --> 27:23.374
so I'm thinking
I should go pick him up.

27:23.376 --> 27:26.844
Let me talk to him first,
please.

27:27.613 --> 27:28.779
I don't want him shamed.

27:28.781 --> 27:33.183
I just want him to admit
to what he's done.

27:33.185 --> 27:38.022
And when I'm done
talking to him,

27:38.024 --> 27:38.922
I hope you'll talk to me.

27:38.924 --> 27:42.259
Well, I'm gonna for sure want
to hear about that afterwards.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.862
No, I mean I hope
you'll talk to me.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.497
I'm always happy to
talk to you, Father.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.966
What would you like
to talk about?

27:48.968 --> 27:50.634
Oh, anything, something.

27:50.636 --> 27:54.304

right down my throat.

on to, nothing to lean on.

34:53.926 --> 34:57.227
She's the one who reported
my girl missing.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.696
Who wants to go
for a ride in the car?

34:59.698 --> 35:02.399
Just over to St. Finian's.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.366
Don't make me go alone.

35:03.368 --> 35:04.234
What's over at St. Finian's?

35:04.236 --> 35:07.938
Priest strangled
in the vestry,
if you can believe it.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.172
What's the world coming to?

35:09.174 --> 35:12.742
Father Mick... Mack...
Some harp name.
Maybe a robbery.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.578
They didn't say if anything
was missing.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.114
You're calling someone
a harp, Dunphy?

35:17.116 --> 35:20.584
CUTLER: I'll go.
We can stop for chili dogs.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.319
It's right on the way.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.489
Hey.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.625
You doing
all right there?

35:30.562 --> 35:31.795
I'm tired.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.930
(SIGHING)

35:34.600 --> 35:36.733
And I know who did it.

35:52.384 --> 35:52.816
You ready?

35:52.818 --> 35:56.319
Bring him out,
get his reaction
when he sees the body.

35:56.321 --> 35:56.887
Where did they find him?

35:56.889 --> 35:58.822
Stairs of the parish house.
Said he'd been asleep,

35:58.824 --> 35:59.723
blinking like a babe
in the woods.

35:59.725 --> 36:04.060
Very convincing.
Almost had to ask for
absolution for waking them up.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.595
Father, there you are.

36:05.597 --> 36:10.500
Are you sure you're
prepared for this now,
very disturbing sight.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.007
-Two?
-What?

36:17.009 --> 36:18.708
You should have
brought more cops.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.710
CUTLER: No, Sam. Sam!

36:20.712 --> 36:23.146
(CLAMORING)

36:27.252 --> 36:28.752
What're you doing?

37:00.719 --> 37:02.252
After this we'll head
over to the blue room.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.087
There's a delivery coming,
all right?

37:04.089 --> 37:05.488
I want them just to
jump right on it.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.557
Get things going,
but I want you there

37:07.559 --> 37:08.225
for my eyes and ears.

37:08.227 --> 37:11.928
Hey, sorry to interrupt,
but the package is here.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.330
Here? Why is it here?

37:13.332 --> 37:16.166
I don't know,
someone got confused?

37:16.168 --> 37:19.402
I said not to leave it,
but he said you said to.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.004
He said, I...

37:21.006 --> 37:23.406
Unbelievable.
Where is he?

37:23.408 --> 37:24.140
Guest performer
dressing room.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.743
All right. Come on,
let's just get it,
put it in your car,

37:26.745 --> 37:28.945
take it over to
the Satans right now.

37:28.947 --> 37:32.148
Hey, Brian, hold on
a second, man.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.257
BUTANO JR.: What the hell
are you doing here?

37:40.259 --> 37:43.326
(GUNSHOTS)

38:24.336 --> 38:28.405
SAM: <i> Please, tell me</i>
<i> about your first day</i>
<i> of work at the hospital.</i>

38:28.407 --> 38:29.639
(SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

38:29.641 --> 38:31.708
For the love of God, why?

38:31.710 --> 38:35.612
I kind of need to hear
a good story today, right now.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.315
How are you
so sure it is one?

38:38.317 --> 38:41.217
You know it is
and you know why.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.218
You got your job,

38:42.220 --> 38:45.288
and you got your uniform,
and put on your hat,

38:45.290 --> 38:48.425
you got to the hospital
and you said, "Good morning."

38:48.427 --> 38:49.926
And then...

38:49.928 --> 38:50.360
(SONG ENDS)

38:50.362 --> 38:53.430
MARTHA:
Well, there wasn't all the
disposable equipment

38:53.432 --> 38:54.597
-back then so...
-Mmm-hmm.

38:54.599 --> 38:57.367
-(SONG PLAYING)
-The nurses had to
sterilize the syringes

38:57.369 --> 38:58.601
and the needles
and the tubes.

38:58.603 --> 39:01.871
You know, soak and scrub them,
and put them in the autoclave

39:01.873 --> 39:03.673
to kill the germs.

39:03.675 --> 39:04.507
Yeah.

39:04.509 --> 39:08.311
And after eight hours,
my legs were tired, so...

39:08.313 --> 39:10.914
-Mmm-hmm.
-I decided to sit on the desk

39:10.916 --> 39:12.749
while I did my work.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.685
And this head of department
walks by and sees me

39:15.687 --> 39:19.656
sitting there and I
thought I was fired.

39:20.392 --> 39:23.526
He looks at me and he says,

39:23.528 --> 39:25.195
"Smart thinking, nurse."

39:28.300 --> 39:30.033
It was glorious.

39:33.004 --> 39:33.636
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:33.638 --> 39:35.772
Did I imagine that
or did that happen?

39:35.774 --> 39:38.141
-That happened.
-All right.

39:38.243 --> 39:40.110
Could be booze delivery.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.781
Hello?

39:44.783 --> 39:46.049
Hi.

39:46.051 --> 39:49.119
I left a message
with your service.

39:49.121 --> 39:51.020
Maybe more than one.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.691
I haven't picked up any.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.330
Oh, um, that's fine.

40:00.332 --> 40:03.867
I just... I didn't feel right
coming by the station again.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.803
You know, with everything
that goes on there.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.839
Especially since what
I'm asking isn't official

40:09.841 --> 40:10.407
police business anyway.

40:10.409 --> 40:15.245
You know, I wouldn't
want to get you
into any trouble, or...

40:16.081 --> 40:17.180
I'm sorry.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.449
No, don't be.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.285
Well, if you find out
anything...

40:22.287 --> 40:26.322
I'll let you know
soon as I do.

40:26.591 --> 40:32.629
And thank you
for your patience.

40:35.066 --> 40:37.133
Thank you for yours.

40:45.343 --> 40:48.445
I'll give her a second
and then I'll go out
the service entrance,

40:48.447 --> 40:49.813
in case
she's still out front.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.815
Just tell me where it is.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.384
I'm sorry.

40:56.688 --> 40:59.989
People need to stop
apologizing so much.

41:03.962 --> 41:08.064
Hey, did you ever know
a Louise Mitchell?

41:08.834 --> 41:11.601
Yeah, I used to run
with Louise.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.437
We weren't very close
but I liked her a lot.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.806
At least until
she skipped town anyway.

41:17.709 --> 41:18.908
Why?
