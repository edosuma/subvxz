00:01.218 --> 00:04.134
<i>Previously on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

00:04.178 --> 00:06.528
Are we supposed to clap or just,
like, respect and be quiet?

00:06.571 --> 00:08.791
- I think just respect.
- Okay.

00:09.922 --> 00:12.490
All aboard the Jen Shah Express!

00:15.145 --> 00:18.148
I think booze and bike rides is
what this group needs right now.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.675
Will told me...

00:23.719 --> 00:28.289
that I was actually abused,
and I just don't remember it.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.987
My siblings, Curtis and Kelli--

00:31.031 --> 00:33.511
they're on a similar journey,
and we're all coming together,

00:33.555 --> 00:35.861
and I get to see
my brother Curtis

00:35.905 --> 00:38.168
that I haven't seen in years.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.475
I wasn't expecting this.

00:41.998 --> 00:45.654
And I really need it now
more than ever, so thank you.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.310
Mm-hmm. Affairs.

00:50.441 --> 00:53.618
It's rumored that one of your...

00:53.662 --> 00:56.360
that has the Jazz tickets...
- I don't know who you're--

00:56.404 --> 00:57.970
...that you've been involved
with them.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.495
- Are you crazy?!
- No.

01:04.107 --> 01:07.719
Angie told us John Barlow's
friend had those tickets.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.286
I never heard it.
You don't think I would love

01:09.330 --> 01:11.549
that information on her?

01:11.593 --> 01:13.769
- You are lying right now.
- Tell me how!

01:17.251 --> 01:19.340
Angie told us,
and you were there.

01:19.383 --> 01:22.560
- I did not hear it.
- You were there.

01:22.604 --> 01:26.260
you for calling me
a----ing liar!

01:26.303 --> 01:28.740
- You called <i>me</i> a liar.
- Goddamn you.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.655
Heather.

01:30.699 --> 01:33.702
you!

01:33.745 --> 01:36.879
Hey, [bleep] me, please.
I'd love to be----ed.

01:36.922 --> 01:40.100
Heather, what happened?

01:40.143 --> 01:42.928
- What is going on?
- She's lying.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.583
Tonight was supposed to be
hot girls in lingerie,

01:45.627 --> 01:49.196
gnawing away at hunks of meat,
and then Whitney decided

01:49.239 --> 01:52.329
to unload all of these rumors

01:52.373 --> 01:55.941
about Lisa giving blowies
for basketball seats,

01:55.985 --> 01:58.596
and now she's dragged me
into it,

01:58.640 --> 02:03.166
and I'm a liar in lingerie
without a steak to be found.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.084
Whitney said that I had heard
this nugget

02:08.128 --> 02:11.914
about Lisa----ing some guy
for courtside Jazz tickets.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.483
She's drunk, and she doesn't
know what she's saying.

02:15.526 --> 02:19.965
Heather didn't even
know what I was going through

02:20.009 --> 02:23.795
because I just sit there
and listen to her sh--.

02:23.839 --> 02:28.278
She never took time to even
ask me how I was doing.

02:28.322 --> 02:31.629
It goes straight to my abuse.

02:31.673 --> 02:36.939
Like, everyone uses me
for what they want.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.288
I'm starting to realize now

02:38.332 --> 02:40.899
that because of the abuse
that I suffered as a kid,

02:40.943 --> 02:45.077
I never learned how
to stand up for myself

02:45.121 --> 02:47.906
or how to set boundaries
with people.

02:47.950 --> 02:51.040
And now that I am able
to hold a boundary,

02:51.083 --> 02:53.956
other people struggle with it

02:53.999 --> 02:55.958
because they're seeing me
show up in a different way

02:56.001 --> 02:57.873
that they weren't expecting.

03:01.572 --> 03:05.228
I'm just done needing
everyone else's sh--.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.752
I will not own sh--
that never happened.

03:07.796 --> 03:11.016
I'm really hurt by Heather.
She's the person

03:11.060 --> 03:13.845
who knows me the best,
who I'm closest to,

03:13.889 --> 03:18.241
who'd I'd expect to be there
for me in my darkest hour.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.112
I'm starting to realize that

03:20.156 --> 03:23.246
maybe Heather doesn't give
a [bleep] about me.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.813
I am done! I am not a pawn!

03:24.856 --> 03:26.815
Okay, let's--let's not--
let's not...

03:26.858 --> 03:28.251
- I'm so mad.
- ...get violent with the tongs.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.993
Sorry.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.301
I've never fought with Whitney
like this ever.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.172
We have had big disagreements,

03:36.216 --> 03:40.307
but she's never looked at me
and called me a liar ever.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.657
And that's, like,
a pretty big accusation

03:42.700 --> 03:45.094
about a pretty stupid thing.

03:45.137 --> 03:48.402
Don't call me a liar ever.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.099
- You called me a liar first.
- I never did.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.101
- Look at me. Look at me.
- We talked about it, babe.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.582
You are too drunk right now
to be cognizant

03:54.625 --> 03:55.844
of what's happening.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.715
- Don't do that.
- You better be real.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.240
And if you need more validity,
find some facts.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.067
The facts is Angie.
Let's call Angie,

04:02.111 --> 04:04.156
because Angie told you and I.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.899
I don't care who Lisa's----ed.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.032
I don't care
who Meredith's----ed.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.556
I don't care who you----ed,
who Jen's----ed.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.603
I don't care!
I want to come together

04:15.646 --> 04:18.388
and support our friend
who's facing--

04:18.432 --> 04:21.173
I'm sorry--50 years in prison.

04:21.217 --> 04:25.047
And guess what this
entire evening has become about?

04:25.090 --> 04:27.397
You and you and Lisa.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.095
And that is not the purpose
of this trip.

04:30.139 --> 04:33.360
So get focused and realize
what this is all about.

04:33.403 --> 04:36.580
On----ing what?!

04:36.624 --> 04:37.755
- Because Angie said--
- If I was loaded,

04:37.799 --> 04:40.584
then don't hold me
- ing accountable!

04:40.628 --> 04:42.151
- We walked up--
- you!

04:42.194 --> 04:43.718
I'm not doing that!

04:43.761 --> 04:46.068
You just lost me
for----ing ever!

04:46.111 --> 04:47.548
You lost me forever,

04:47.591 --> 04:48.940
and that was the biggest
- ing mistake of your life.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.246
Okay, you guys, you guys.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.509
You did not lose me forever, Heather.

04:52.553 --> 04:57.340
No, <i>you</i> lost <i>me,</i> bitch.
You lost me.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.211
Bitch, don't come at me.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.736
Oh, my God.

05:01.779 --> 05:05.783
I am already barely forging
a foundation with Lisa,

05:05.827 --> 05:08.569
and the last thing I wanna do
is just lie,

05:08.612 --> 05:12.442
and your path to truth
and friendship with Lisa

05:12.486 --> 05:14.096
is not mine,

05:14.139 --> 05:18.753
certainly not if it requires me
to lie or back up bullsh--.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.802
It's 'cause it pushes them up.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.762
Because they're, like,
at eye level.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.853
Thanks for being my friend tonight.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.985
I appreciate, like,
the progress we've made...

05:34.029 --> 05:37.119
- I do, too.
- ...and, like, where we are.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.642
You don't have to thank me
for being your friend.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.252
I wanna be your friend.
I'll show up as your friend.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.471
Thank you.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.125
And I'm telling you as a friend,

05:43.168 --> 05:46.911
I have never had a conversation
with any single person here

05:46.955 --> 05:48.783
about anything
about your marriage

05:48.826 --> 05:51.351
or your extramarital affairs.
- Thank you. Thank you.

05:51.394 --> 05:54.310
I'm flying to New York
tomorrow night on the red eye.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.486
Yeah, which is why we don't
need to talk about this anymore.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.922
- Go. Yeah.
- She's leaving for New York...

05:57.966 --> 05:59.837
- Mm-hmm.
- ...to prepare for the trial

05:59.881 --> 06:01.535
of her goddamn life.
- For your life.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.494
I'm going to bed.
Love you. Love you.

06:04.538 --> 06:05.800
I'm gonna sleep.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.890
And let me just sleep.
I need to call John.

06:14.461 --> 06:17.377
Thanks for being here for me.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.086
I have brought
a professional in.

06:32.217 --> 06:35.438
Next on stage!

06:35.482 --> 06:39.529
Crystal Pussy!

06:39.573 --> 06:42.967
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:43.011 --> 06:48.408
This feels wrong. I mean,
does anybody else feel wrong?

06:48.451 --> 06:50.061
All right, ladies!

06:50.105 --> 06:52.934
No! She's an instructor.

06:52.977 --> 06:56.720
Oh. How rude of me to assume
she was gonna perform.

06:56.764 --> 07:00.855
What'd you do,
fly her in from Atlantic City?

07:00.898 --> 07:03.771
The current Shah Squad--you
gotta wear a lot of hats, okay?

07:03.814 --> 07:08.819
My makeup artist is also
Crystal Pussy.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.908
She is also
a twerking instructor.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.432
I signed up
for twerking classes.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.260
But turn around.
What is this outfit?

07:17.480 --> 07:19.439
- Goddamn.
- Wow.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.049
I want y'all to twerk

07:21.092 --> 07:24.313
like you need to make
some money to pay your rent.

07:24.356 --> 07:27.447
Hello, we're on this
healing trip for me, I thought.

07:27.490 --> 07:31.451
So you know what? Let me bring
the healing Crystal Pussy

07:31.494 --> 07:32.756
to the party.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.063
Okay, you guys can all go,
like, down here.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.630
Pay your rent.
You wanna go home?

07:36.673 --> 07:38.240
You wanna have power?
You wanna have light?

07:38.283 --> 07:40.111
You wanna have a roof
over your head?

07:40.155 --> 07:41.809
- Okay, ready?
- Pay that rent.

07:41.852 --> 07:45.508
Pay that rent, pay that rent,
pay that rent, pay that rent.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.989
What?

07:48.032 --> 07:50.470
Okay, paying that
rent, you're paying that rent.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.471
- Yes!
- Here we go.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.473
You live so expensive.

07:55.823 --> 07:58.913
I don't think I was built
to twerk.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.393
No, she can twerk everywhere.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.134
I can squeeze one butt cheek.

08:03.178 --> 08:06.398
It is definitely not
in my wheelhouse.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.227
I will not be making rent
this month,

08:09.271 --> 08:10.968
and I'm okay with it.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.535
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.320
Good night. Love y'all.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.887
<i>Coming up...</i>

08:16.931 --> 08:21.675
I realize I was just being
manipulated and used and abused.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.472
Okay.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.352
What in the world?

08:55.273 --> 08:57.537
That's where...

09:10.027 --> 09:14.684
"Heather, no words needed here.
Bad Weather, no matter what.

09:14.728 --> 09:17.034
XOXO, Whitney."

09:20.037 --> 09:22.170
I've come to speak
with the emperor.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.259
Oh.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.698
- Those are cute pajammies.
- Thank you.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.874
They look much warmer
and tropical...

09:30.918 --> 09:32.920
...than the weather
is reflecting?

09:32.963 --> 09:36.097
Yeah, I mean, why is it raining
in the desert?

09:36.140 --> 09:39.404
- Did we bring the rain?
- I think our behavior did.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.235
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.194
Good morning.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.719
It's raining.

09:49.763 --> 09:53.636
You look comfy and cozy.
Wait. Do we have coffee?

09:55.464 --> 09:57.466
I woke up to
a very visual representation

09:57.509 --> 10:01.122
of how Whitney feels about our
friendship right now.

10:01.165 --> 10:04.255
She was very upset last night.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.824
She ripped up, um,
our friendship card.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.304
In my room,
when I woke up this morning,

10:09.347 --> 10:10.784
it was shredded.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.830
Actually, I know how I can
get her back.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.016
She left it for me to find,

10:26.060 --> 10:28.540
and I'm just, like,
what the [bleep]?

10:28.584 --> 10:30.325
I didn't realize it

10:30.368 --> 10:31.805
'cause I just walked
through it last night.

10:31.848 --> 10:34.590
I fell asleep in a pile
of Milk Duds and...

10:36.636 --> 10:38.986
That was how that night ended.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.857
How are you doing
this morning?

10:40.901 --> 10:42.903
How I feel?

10:45.645 --> 10:49.344
You think you can have
a talk with Heather today?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.868
Yeah, but I'm just...

10:51.912 --> 10:53.522
You're hurt.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.306
Feel completely betrayed.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.395
I think there's a lot
of things going on.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.180
I mean, obviously, she's dealing

10:59.223 --> 11:01.835
with her own emotional stuff
right now.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.924
I love her.
I would never betray her.

11:03.967 --> 11:07.667
I would never even speak ill
of her.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.842
I gotta go get ready...

11:08.885 --> 11:10.626
- Okay.
- ...to see my brother.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.150
Is your sister gonna be there?

11:13.194 --> 11:14.499
I hope so.

11:14.543 --> 11:15.892
Are you okay to go see him?

11:15.936 --> 11:18.112
I don't know.

11:18.155 --> 11:21.245
There are two people
in this world

11:21.289 --> 11:24.727
that understand and know what
I'm going through right now,

11:24.771 --> 11:28.035
and that's my half-brother
and sister, Curtis and Kelli.

11:28.078 --> 11:31.081
Curtis really encouraged me
to push through

11:31.125 --> 11:35.869
and come on this trip,
so I need to see them.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.610
...see you.
Will you keep me posted?

11:38.654 --> 11:40.743
Yeah, I'm gonna get there
so I can come back...

11:40.787 --> 11:42.440
- Okay. Okay.
- ...before you go.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.833
Let me know when you leave
and stuff.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.400
Okay, I will.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.230
Oh, I need to pack this.

11:49.273 --> 11:52.233
This reprieve for a couple days,
it's done now.

11:52.276 --> 11:55.149
Now it's back to reality.
Now I have to

11:55.192 --> 11:58.892
get back and immersed
into trial preparation.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.198
I just wanted a minute,
a few days,

12:01.242 --> 12:03.592
to just pretend
this was not happening.

12:03.635 --> 12:07.074
It gives me anxiety
because of what I know

12:07.117 --> 12:09.424
the consequences are
and what this means

12:09.467 --> 12:12.296
for me and my family.

12:15.691 --> 12:18.259
This is what's blowing my mind.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.828
This whole trip was supposed
to be about Jen.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.525
I know.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.788
This whole trip was supposed
to be fun,

12:25.832 --> 12:28.095
and instead, Whitney's sobbing.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.271
I recognize somehow
that this was all, like,

12:30.314 --> 12:33.187
triggering back
to her abuse side of things.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.842
I didn't get mad at her.
I was hugging her

12:35.885 --> 12:40.368
because I know she is suffering
so deeply inside right now

12:40.411 --> 12:43.327
trying to put
these pieces together.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.637
- Hello.
- Good morning.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.899
Good morning.

12:55.122 --> 12:59.822
This entire process
is very intense for me.

12:59.866 --> 13:03.652
I'm hopeful that
I can find some relief

13:03.695 --> 13:07.525
and some comfort in meeting
with Curtis and Kelli

13:07.569 --> 13:10.964
and continue to connect the dots
that I...

13:11.007 --> 13:15.272
have forgotten
about my childhood.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.639
Whit!

13:34.683 --> 13:37.817
What's up? Oh, my God.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.167
Welcome.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.691
- How are you?
- Good. Been good.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.432
Come on in.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.564
You're looking good.
Thank you. You, too.

13:46.608 --> 13:47.957
- Hey.
- Hi, Tanya.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.568
- Nice to see you.
- I haven't seen you in so long.

13:50.612 --> 13:53.267
- Your house is amazing.
- Thank you.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.703
I wish I was staying
at this house.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.096
Whitney!

13:56.139 --> 13:58.663
- Uh-oh.
- Oh! My sissy!

14:02.363 --> 14:04.278
Good to see you.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.454
Oh, Whit.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.895
Curtis and Kelli and I
share the same father.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.505
We have different mothers.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.986
I worry about you not having us
with you, you know?

14:17.030 --> 14:18.988
Oh, that's why I'm here.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.382
I wasn't extremely close to them
growing up

14:21.425 --> 14:23.471
because when my dad
divorced their mom

14:23.514 --> 14:27.431
and married my mom
and had me and my sister,

14:27.475 --> 14:31.348
he really just focused his time
on... our family.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.481
Like, I saw Curtis and Kelli

14:33.524 --> 14:35.222
maybe a handful of times
throughout my childhood.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.267
I'm just so grateful that

14:37.311 --> 14:39.487
they're willing
to show up for me now,

14:39.530 --> 14:42.185
and I can have them
a part of my life now.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.665
I remember when you were born.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.407
I got a phone call saying,
"You have a little sister.

14:46.450 --> 14:47.930
Her name's Whitney,"
and I was like, "Who is this?"

14:47.974 --> 14:49.497
You know?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.499
Justin and I talk about that
a lot. I'm like,

14:51.542 --> 14:52.935
"I have an older sister..."
- Yeah.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.458
-"...that you've never met."
- Yeah.

14:54.502 --> 14:55.938
- You never met Justin?
- Unh-unh.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.244
- No.
- Justin's cool.

14:57.287 --> 15:00.595
I'm on, like,
this massive healing journey.

15:02.771 --> 15:05.426
I just have this gaping wound...

15:05.469 --> 15:08.951
- Yeah.
- ...that I need to close,

15:08.995 --> 15:12.259
and I just feel like you both
are the missing link to that.

15:12.302 --> 15:15.305
I hate that we didn't have
a connection growing up.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.177
- Oh, we did. We did.
- We're connected.

15:17.220 --> 15:20.093
I've always felt like
we're a lot alike.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.140
When I went to Utah,
before I went on the mission,

15:24.184 --> 15:25.881
I spent some time
with you there.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.970
You did?

15:28.014 --> 15:29.450
Yeah, you probably don't
remember that, but I do.

15:29.493 --> 15:30.755
- I was in college.
- I can feel--

15:30.799 --> 15:32.279
I feel things,
so when you were saying that,

15:32.322 --> 15:35.021
like, I have--
I know you were around.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.674
I know I saw you.

15:36.718 --> 15:40.026
And... you know,
and I talk to Will a lot

15:40.069 --> 15:42.637
about different memories
that I have.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.465
Yeah.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.423
Um, and just through
this process,

15:46.467 --> 15:51.602
I realized I was just being
manipulated and used and abused.

15:53.648 --> 15:57.652
Like, I just realized
even though our situations

15:57.695 --> 15:59.654
are probably different,
the feeling's the same.

16:01.525 --> 16:04.746
While Curtis, Kelli,
and I's traumas

16:04.789 --> 16:06.095
are all different,

16:06.139 --> 16:08.184
we share the same feeling
of being let down

16:08.228 --> 16:11.013
by this person that we all knew

16:11.057 --> 16:17.802
and... we should have
been able to trust.

16:17.846 --> 16:21.850
I think for me, I realized early
that hurt people

16:21.893 --> 16:23.504
hurt other people.
- Yeah.

16:23.547 --> 16:26.507
And so if somebody
is hurting me, like,

16:26.550 --> 16:28.639
I automatically think
you must be hurting.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.685
There--There's two sides
of the coin, right,

16:30.728 --> 16:33.905
and we get to choose which side
we look at.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.211
I can't erase the negative.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.822
I can just erase the way
I-I can feel about it.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.347
There's a lot of good that came
from that relationship,

16:40.390 --> 16:43.524
and you have to remember that.

16:43.567 --> 16:47.006
And I think every time
you find that gratitude,

16:47.049 --> 16:50.444
at least in my life, it gets me
out in front of the negative.

16:50.487 --> 16:51.923
Yeah.

16:51.967 --> 16:57.190
And I'm telling you, it'll never
make sense to you, okay?

16:57.233 --> 16:58.800
That's what you need
to understand.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.802
It will never make sense.
There's never gonna be a moment

17:00.845 --> 17:02.760
where you're like, "Okay,
I'm free. I'm successful.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.284
I've got it.
Everything is good."

17:04.327 --> 17:06.373
No, because
it's not your wound to heal,

17:06.416 --> 17:07.896
and it may never happen.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.594
Do you want it to just disappear
and never feel it?

17:10.638 --> 17:12.944
'Cause I don't--
it hasn't for me yet.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.164
It never will, ever.

17:15.208 --> 17:19.299
No I just needed to see you both
and hear you say

17:19.342 --> 17:21.170
that it's okay that I let it go.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.954
Yeah, no, move on.

17:22.998 --> 17:26.523
Everybody's got something
that they have to deal with.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.872
Mm-hmm.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.223
So deal with it,
but give it a time and a place.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.876
You have to, Whitney.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.966
I don't know what the next steps
are to continue to heal

17:35.010 --> 17:39.058
and move on, but I do know
that I'm gonna let go,

17:39.101 --> 17:41.886
because this is no longer
serving me,

17:41.930 --> 17:46.108
and I know that Curtis and Kelli
are going to be instrumental

17:46.152 --> 17:48.415
in helping me get through that.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.243
I'm super proud of you, Whitney.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.896
- Thank you, Curtis.
- I'm proud of you, too.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.339
<i>Coming up...</i>

17:59.382 --> 18:02.211
It is hard to sit there
and listen to lies,

18:02.255 --> 18:04.083
and you can't talk.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.649
What is the expression they
want you to have? Just stoic?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.477
- Blank, probably, right?
- Blank?

18:07.521 --> 18:10.219
Yeah. My lead trial attorney
said, "You know, Jen,

18:10.263 --> 18:13.701
I'm gonna need you to, uh,
not get Botox."

18:30.109 --> 18:32.415
Hi, Heather. Mmm.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.505
Hi. Good morning... ish.

18:35.549 --> 18:39.292
I've got eggs, bacon,
hash browns.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.816
So Jen's leaving soon.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.339
Well, I'm glad we got
a fun girls trip for her.

18:43.383 --> 18:46.255
Well, I hope she thinks
it was fun.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.517
It wasn't fun.

18:47.561 --> 18:51.173
There's nothing fun about it.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.001
What time did you end up
going to bed?

18:53.044 --> 18:54.394
I stayed up till, like, 3.

18:56.657 --> 18:57.701
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.709
I still feel awkward
about everything.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.321
I feel like I'm getting
to a better place with Meredith,

19:08.364 --> 19:10.584
But I still don't know
what her role was

19:10.627 --> 19:12.368
in all of these rumors.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.327
I was really upset last night.
I called John.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.024
He helped calm me down.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.721
After having a burrito
and some Kit Kats,

19:17.765 --> 19:19.506
I realized this needs
to be about Jen.

19:19.549 --> 19:22.030
So I'm gonna put all
this petty bullsh-- aside

19:22.073 --> 19:24.424
for a little bit, and we'll
figure out everything later.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.383
Right now I need to be here
for Jen.

19:27.427 --> 19:30.386
The heavens are crying
'cause Jen's leaving.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.040
Good morning!

19:32.083 --> 19:34.085
Hi!

19:34.129 --> 19:35.870
Oh, hi. Hi.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.915
Cheers to the new day.

19:37.959 --> 19:41.615
Jen, how are you feeling
about everything?

19:41.658 --> 19:46.881
Like a full-on anxiety attack
this morning.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.578
'Cause I have to, like,
actually fly to New York,

19:48.622 --> 19:50.624
and I'm going by myself.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.191
Are you going through discovery
with them?

19:52.234 --> 19:53.801
Are you doing, like,
depositions? What are you doing?

19:53.844 --> 19:57.544
No, we are going to do another
mock trial while I'm there.

19:57.587 --> 20:01.330
And this is the first time
I will be hearing our side.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.940
- Okay.
- The defense side.

20:02.984 --> 20:07.597
We did a mock trial last week
of the...

20:07.641 --> 20:09.077
- Prosecution?
- Prosecution side.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.123
And I mean, I walked out twice,
slammed the door.

20:13.777 --> 20:17.477
It is hard to sit there
and listen to lies,

20:17.520 --> 20:18.956
and you can't talk.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.306
What is the expression they want
you to have? Just stoic?

20:20.349 --> 20:21.916
- Blank, probably, right?
- Blank?

20:21.959 --> 20:24.658
Yeah. In fact,
my lead trial attorney, Priya,

20:24.701 --> 20:27.922
said, "You know, Jen,
I'm gonna need you to, uh,

20:27.965 --> 20:30.011
not get Botox."

20:32.100 --> 20:33.623
And I'm like, "What?"

20:33.667 --> 20:35.146
She goes,
"When we were talking earlier,

20:35.190 --> 20:37.975
you were talking about
something very emotional,

20:38.019 --> 20:39.673
and you're crying,
but your face isn't moving.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.240
I need your face to move."
- Oh.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.678
Wait. So you're--
you're taking the stand.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.854
You're totally testifying.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.943
I have no issue testifying.
I think it just depends.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.771
- Like, we don't--you don't know.
- Strategic.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.425
- They don't know yet for sure.
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:52.468 --> 20:56.559
We are a month away now.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.953
That's why this trip
was important to me

20:58.996 --> 21:02.348
'cause I need a little bit
of, like, reprieve from that

21:02.391 --> 21:05.307
and to just, like, get away.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.527
What are you doing
to calm yourself

21:07.570 --> 21:10.486
and to keep yourself, like...

21:10.530 --> 21:13.663
A lot of times I'll go...

21:13.707 --> 21:15.361
just lay down next to Omar.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.058
Aw.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.800
And that calms me down.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.761
It's really hard for my boys

21:24.805 --> 21:28.983
for Omar to think about that and...

21:29.026 --> 21:31.681
think of, like, not having
his mom around.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.466
It put in perspective
all of the blessings

21:33.509 --> 21:36.686
and things that I have to be
grateful for.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.863
That's why I've just
tried to, like,

21:39.907 --> 21:42.692
not take anything for granted anymore

21:42.736 --> 21:45.869
and celebrate every single day,
'cause what if

21:45.913 --> 21:51.353
something happens and I'm not
here to celebrate it next year?

21:54.095 --> 21:56.967
It's overwhelming.

22:01.015 --> 22:06.499
Gonna be leaving here
probably in, like, 45 minutes.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.370
Oh, hi.

22:08.414 --> 22:09.458
Hello.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.068
You look pretty and refreshed.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.509
Sorry. I...My brother's house
took a little bit longer,

22:16.552 --> 22:18.337
but keep going.
- Oh.

22:19.773 --> 22:23.777
I haven't spoken to Heather
or seen her,

22:23.820 --> 22:28.825
and honestly, right now I want
nothing to do with her.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.871
- Are you all packed?
- Pretty much.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.568
And pretty much for me means...

22:32.612 --> 22:34.527
- She's not.
- Yeah.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.401
Do you want us
to help you pack?

22:39.445 --> 22:41.316
Yeah, probably, 'cause,

22:41.360 --> 22:44.841
you know, I'm not very good
at making flights at all.

22:46.408 --> 22:50.804
You know, Jen's been putting on
an amazing brave face,

22:50.847 --> 22:52.632
but we're all starting
to see her crack,

22:52.675 --> 22:54.721
and we don't know
what's gonna happen,

22:54.764 --> 22:56.766
and in a year from now,
I don't know if she's gonna be

22:56.810 --> 22:58.464
at the same table
with all of us.

22:58.507 --> 23:02.772
You have so much stuff in here.
Now I can see what I can borrow.

23:02.816 --> 23:05.079
Okay, I'm leaving these games

23:05.122 --> 23:06.863
for you guys
to play while I'm gone.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.604
We're not gonna play any games

23:08.648 --> 23:10.519
or have any fun without you.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.347
Hair, hair, hair.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.131
More hair here.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.959
My gosh, it's some hair.

23:16.003 --> 23:19.528
Okay, you know what?
I think I need to get changed.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.622
Jen, we'll get
your bags. We'll get your bags.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.451
You got this. You got this.

23:29.495 --> 23:32.498
This trip meant a lot to me.

23:32.541 --> 23:33.934
- Be safe.
- Come on. Group hug. Group hug.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.806
Group hug.
Group hug. Group hug.

23:36.850 --> 23:39.809
These four women believe in me,
love me, and support me,

23:39.853 --> 23:42.812
and that's what's important
to me.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.685
Okay, you're gonna miss
your plane. Go, go, go. Love ya.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.382
- Get in the car.
- Bye, babe.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.688
- You look great.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.254
- Bye!
- Love you!

23:50.298 --> 23:52.169
Love you! Bye!

23:55.521 --> 23:58.175
Farewell!

23:58.219 --> 24:00.743
Oh, my gosh.

24:00.787 --> 24:04.530
I feel overwhelmed.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

24:06.227 --> 24:09.665
Yeah, I think that's smart.
I'm gonna do the same.

24:27.596 --> 24:30.033
With everything Jen has
going on,

24:30.077 --> 24:32.688
and her trial looming
over her head,

24:32.732 --> 24:35.169
it gives perspective
on letting things go.

24:35.212 --> 24:37.824
I mean, nothing is bigger than
what she has going on right now

24:37.867 --> 24:39.652
within this group.

24:39.695 --> 24:42.132
- It's a lot.
- It's a lot.

24:42.176 --> 24:44.004
I don't know if my eyelids

24:44.047 --> 24:46.963
can take any more crying.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.315
<i>Coming up...</i>

24:51.359 --> 24:54.362
The trip got derailed, and it
wasn't me that derailed it.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.799
You pushed me into the wall
and called me a liar.

24:56.843 --> 25:00.716
You are up a river
with no paddle. Stop!

25:21.432 --> 25:26.612
Ladies, we have
reservations! Let's go!

25:26.655 --> 25:28.614
Did you call?

25:28.657 --> 25:30.006
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:30.050 --> 25:31.312
Lisa!

25:31.355 --> 25:34.620
Hold yourself to
a high standard of timeliness!

25:34.663 --> 25:37.405
I have no standards.
Let's just go.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.503
Oh, it's raining hard, huh?

25:48.547 --> 25:51.158
Oh. Yes, the rain.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.334
Hi.

25:53.377 --> 25:56.076
Thank you.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.034
That'd be wonderful.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.688
You guys are gonna be
right here.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.342
We'll get some waters
out for you guys.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.822
- Thank you.
- Get all comfortable.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.388
Oh, thank you.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.831
We have some bottles of 1942
to welcome you to Whiskey Row.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.616
- Ooh!
- Whoo!

26:16.400 --> 26:18.620
- Whoo, thank you.
- Here's one for you.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.230
- Very exciting.
- Thank you.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.492
May I get a Diet Coke, too?
Okay, thanks.

26:21.536 --> 26:24.365
- Yes, of course.
- What are we gonna toast to?

26:24.408 --> 26:28.195
I think everybody
should pick just one word

26:28.238 --> 26:30.632
of something meaningful
for us all to toast to.

26:30.676 --> 26:33.026
- Okay, I like that.
- One word?

26:33.069 --> 26:34.680
- Think of one word.
- One word.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.638
And I don't know my word, so if
someone else could go first.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.379
Love. I'll do it. Love.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.467
Peace.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.643
- Heather.
- Friendship.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.384
Okay.

26:43.427 --> 26:46.039
Honesty.

26:46.082 --> 26:49.172
Here we go.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.391
Yes.

26:50.434 --> 26:51.479
Cheers.

26:56.223 --> 26:59.095
Heather and I
still have not spoken.

26:59.139 --> 27:02.403
We are still not good
and just because

27:02.446 --> 27:04.840
Heather wants to swoop this
under the rug

27:04.884 --> 27:07.408
does not mean
that last night is over.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.062
We're going there.

27:09.105 --> 27:11.804
I know that I am not lying,

27:11.847 --> 27:13.501
and I know that
she hurt me deeply.

27:13.544 --> 27:17.418
you for calling me
a----ing liar!

27:17.461 --> 27:19.899
You are too drunk right now
to be cognizant

27:19.942 --> 27:21.422
of what's happening.
- Oh, don't do that.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.380
- We walked up to--
- you!

27:23.424 --> 27:24.991
I never heard that!

27:25.034 --> 27:27.907
We ready to put some food in?

27:27.950 --> 27:30.605
Will you just order stuff
for all of us, please?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.085
Um, American Slider,

27:32.128 --> 27:34.609
the Tennessee Hot Slider,
some hummus.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.480
Okay, thank you.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.352
I wanna show you my family.

27:38.395 --> 27:39.396
I'll give you
a little piece of orange peel.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.442
So this is
your dad's oldest son?

27:41.485 --> 27:44.184
- No, she's my dad's firstborn.
- Okay, got it.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.446
Kelli.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.143
- Curtis.
- Oh, you guys have similarities.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.624
- She looks just like my dad.
- Is this your sister?

27:49.668 --> 27:52.627
- My sister and brother.
- That's her dad's oldest child.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.455
She looks beautiful.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.762
- You look so much like her.
- You definitely look related.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.502
You know, I lived in--in,

27:58.546 --> 28:00.591
uh, Scottsdale for a year
of my life.

28:00.635 --> 28:01.636
You did?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.116
- Wait, what?
- I did.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.596
Wait, what?
Why is this just coming up now?

28:05.640 --> 28:07.686
'Cause I didn't think about it
until now.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.037
- No, uh, you told me.
- When we pass my childhood home,

28:11.080 --> 28:12.386
I remember it.
- I told you that, yeah.

28:12.429 --> 28:13.866
Her sister had bronchitis, right?

28:13.909 --> 28:15.476
My sister had
chronic bronchitis,

28:15.519 --> 28:17.652
and my father used to, like,
develop communities

28:17.696 --> 28:21.351
through the Sun Belt states,
and so we moved here for a year

28:21.395 --> 28:22.962
to, like,
dry out my sister's lungs,

28:23.005 --> 28:25.268
you know, to be in the dry heat.

28:29.446 --> 28:30.796
Aw.

28:30.839 --> 28:34.451
And I was remembering

28:34.495 --> 28:37.019
that there was this
one restaurant that I loved

28:37.063 --> 28:39.369
called Pinnacle Peak,

28:39.413 --> 28:43.286
and I would always make
my father wear a tie

28:43.330 --> 28:45.419
because they would cut
your tie off

28:45.462 --> 28:47.377
because it was
the Wild West.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.119
It was just...

28:50.163 --> 28:51.773
And your dad would do that?
He'd wear a tie...

28:51.817 --> 28:53.514
- He would always wear the tie.
- ...would let them cut it?

28:53.557 --> 28:54.471
Yeah.

28:56.691 --> 28:59.259
Just sweet.

28:59.302 --> 29:01.043
You remember that,
and there were a million times

29:01.087 --> 29:02.653
you went to dinner
that you don't remember.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.743
You know what I mean? Which is
why when you have to hold on

29:04.786 --> 29:06.353
to those memories,
'cause they're significant.

29:06.396 --> 29:08.659
You don't ever know
what's gonna hit,

29:08.703 --> 29:10.574
what's gonna imprint, you know?

29:10.618 --> 29:15.536
I need to run to the restroom
really quick.

29:15.579 --> 29:19.235
Well, I'm glad you're having
happy memories.

29:19.279 --> 29:22.804
Yeah. It was good. It was good.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.198
So... how do you feel

29:25.241 --> 29:28.897
about things with Heather
after last night?

29:28.941 --> 29:30.943
Really hurt.

29:30.986 --> 29:33.554
You guys need to talk.

29:35.730 --> 29:39.429
One, it shocked me. Like...

29:39.473 --> 29:42.041
Like, I needed her
in that moment,

29:42.084 --> 29:44.565
because I was doing something
very hard for me

29:44.608 --> 29:46.741
in speaking the truth.

29:46.785 --> 29:53.313
And for her to not back me up
but in fact call me a liar,

29:53.356 --> 29:59.580
that crushed me 'cause
she's literally the one person

29:59.623 --> 30:02.888
that I thought
would never do that to me.

30:02.931 --> 30:07.153
'Cause she knows what
I'm going through

30:07.196 --> 30:10.765
and knows that
my biggest issue is trust,

30:10.809 --> 30:16.597
not being heard, being abused,
and being taken advantage of.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.468
Here's Heather.

30:23.299 --> 30:27.521
- Hello, Heather Gay.
- What did I miss?

30:44.886 --> 30:47.149
For her to not back me up

30:47.193 --> 30:50.065
but in fact call me a liar,

30:50.109 --> 30:53.373
that crushed me.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.505
Here's Heather.

31:00.206 --> 31:02.164
What did I miss?

31:02.208 --> 31:05.689
I was just talking
about last night.

31:05.733 --> 31:09.780
Like... how...

31:12.218 --> 31:14.916
...in a very difficult
situation, I needed you,

31:14.960 --> 31:16.526
and you weren't there for me,

31:16.570 --> 31:18.833
and in fact,
you hurt me deeply...

31:20.748 --> 31:23.359
...and called me a liar
and told me

31:23.403 --> 31:25.666
that I was too drunk,
that I don't remember it,

31:25.709 --> 31:28.060
when I know that you know
what I'm talking about.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.192
Like, that hurt me
because I felt like

31:30.236 --> 31:33.369
you are my girl, Heather,
and in a tough moment

31:33.413 --> 31:35.023
when I needed you...
- I'm unclear on what was

31:35.067 --> 31:36.851
the tough moment
that you needed me.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.202
To corroborate a story
that you had heard?

31:40.246 --> 31:41.812
- What did you need--
- To say that you knew it.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.205
- All I needed you to say--
- I didn't know that.

31:43.249 --> 31:46.556
Heather, let's just be honest
and real.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.429
You and I have had
many conversations about Lisa.

31:49.472 --> 31:53.824
Absolutely not about blowjobs
for courtside seats.

31:53.868 --> 31:56.697
Never once. Never not--Never.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.568
- Yeah, we have.
- If you wanna continue--

31:58.612 --> 32:01.267
Guess what. If someone says
something horrible to me

32:01.310 --> 32:02.703
and I choose to recuse that
and not remember that

32:02.746 --> 32:04.661
and not put it in my bank
and not pull it out

32:04.705 --> 32:08.404
to hurt someone,
that is my----ing choice.

32:08.448 --> 32:09.884
- Then why--
- It is not an indication

32:09.928 --> 32:12.408
of my loyalty to you,
my loyalty to them.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.584
That is my choice.
You wanna talk about sh--,

32:14.628 --> 32:15.934
you talk about it.
- I was.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.936
I don't have to sign up
for every single issue

32:17.979 --> 32:19.372
that is important to you.

32:19.415 --> 32:20.764
But I needed you
in a hard moment.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.418
- You did not need me.
- I did need you.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.159
That is a lie.
You did not need me.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.900
- I did need you.
- Why? To say, "Yeah.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.337
I've heard Lisa gave a blowjob
for courtside seats"?

32:28.381 --> 32:29.643
No, because everyone has--

32:29.686 --> 32:31.166
Can we stop saying that?
'Cause that's really--

32:31.210 --> 32:32.472
That's why I would never say it
'cause it's not true.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.039
I know, but that's
really upsetting to me.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.431
So I'd appreciate
it if you didn't say that.

32:35.475 --> 32:38.043
- I needed...
- You didn't need me.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.567
That's a false idea
in your head.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.177
You're not saying the truth.

32:42.221 --> 32:44.223
It was supposed to be
a trip for Jen.

32:44.266 --> 32:47.791
Why are you coming in screaming
and crying about Lisa's rumors

32:47.835 --> 32:49.271
when the real drama
was our good friend

32:49.315 --> 32:51.404
is facing 50 years in prison

32:51.447 --> 32:54.102
and was leaving alone
on a flight?

32:54.146 --> 32:55.625
Now you're using Jen
as your scapegoat

32:55.669 --> 32:57.671
to what's really going on here.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.195
I mean, Jen's not a scapegoat.
You arranged this trip.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.936
You wanted us to celebrate Jen,

33:01.980 --> 33:04.460
not to work through
all of your personal issues

33:04.504 --> 33:06.985
and your issues
and friendship with Lisa.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.290
You made it about you.

33:08.334 --> 33:09.988
This--I did not make this
about me.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.468
The first night was about you,
and you were crying,

33:12.512 --> 33:14.122
and we talked all about
your childhood abuse.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.906
That was the first dinner.

33:15.950 --> 33:18.866
That was all about you.
That wasn't about Jen.

33:20.172 --> 33:23.262
This is, like, a huge blow

33:23.305 --> 33:25.742
that she isn't supporting me
as her friend

33:25.786 --> 33:29.877
and supporting me as I'm going
through something hard.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.357
Like, it hurts.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.838
This was a fun night,
and we're gonna die on the cross

33:34.882 --> 33:37.711
of, like,
what I've heard about Lisa?

33:37.754 --> 33:42.542
I think you have to explain
because what resonated to me

33:42.585 --> 33:44.152
was not about this or that
is true or false.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.675
It's not about the rumors.

33:45.719 --> 33:49.201
It's about the position
you feel that you are in.

33:49.244 --> 33:54.554
Whether anyone's put you there
or not, those are your feelings,

33:54.597 --> 33:57.252
and you need to explain that
to Heather.

33:57.296 --> 34:00.125
Heather,
what you need to realize,

34:00.168 --> 34:03.128
where my pain is coming from
is because the one person

34:03.171 --> 34:07.697
that was safe to me--you--
that is where my pain is.

34:07.741 --> 34:11.179
Abuse. Being taken advantage of.
Not having a voice.

34:11.223 --> 34:14.704
Poor timing. Poor delivery.
Because I have something to say

34:14.748 --> 34:17.316
but no one----ing listens
to me.

34:17.359 --> 34:20.841
And I needed you in that moment
to just validate

34:20.884 --> 34:23.104
that I was speaking the truth.
That's it.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.888
You hurt me deeply.

34:24.932 --> 34:27.630
You hurt me, too.

34:27.674 --> 34:30.198
You came into my room.
You ripped sh-- up,

34:30.242 --> 34:31.721
knocked stuff over.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.158
How is that a truth seeker
trying to heal?

34:33.201 --> 34:35.508
I did not knock stuff over.
I ripped up your card

34:35.551 --> 34:38.554
because you had hurt me.
- Okay, because you got a truth?

34:38.598 --> 34:40.426
Well, that hurt me,
so we're even.

34:42.645 --> 34:45.866
Well, I'm cleansing a lot of
family out of my life right now.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.824
Okay, well, why don't you
be accountable

34:47.868 --> 34:49.739
for stirring up a lot of drama
on a trip

34:49.783 --> 34:51.045
that was supposed to be
to celebrate our friend

34:51.089 --> 34:53.265
who's facing real problems
and real issues?

34:56.398 --> 34:58.183
Truth seeker?
That's not a true thing.

34:58.226 --> 35:01.403
Not rumors and bullsh--
that she says is not true.

35:01.447 --> 35:02.752
Oh, my God.

35:06.669 --> 35:12.327
At this point, I think Heather
is completely unaware

35:12.371 --> 35:15.417
of how insensitive
she's being to Whitney.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.593
She's going through a lot.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.813
You should be asking her
how she's feeling

35:19.856 --> 35:22.598
and how she's doing
instead of saying

35:22.642 --> 35:24.948
she's making the trip
all about her.

35:24.992 --> 35:28.213
Like, the sensitivity chip--
let's put it back in, Heather.

35:28.256 --> 35:31.651
The trip got derailed, and it
wasn't me that derailed it.

35:31.694 --> 35:34.958
You pushed me into the wall
and called me a liar.

35:35.002 --> 35:37.831
You are up a river
with no paddle. Stop!

35:40.181 --> 35:41.835
You're not gonna put this on me.
I'm not--Look, I did not--

35:41.878 --> 35:44.272
I'm not putting it on you. This
is both of us talking about it.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.795
This is what mature adults do.

35:45.839 --> 35:48.233
But every time I talk
about my feelings, you say,

35:48.276 --> 35:50.148
"Don't talk about feelings.
I don't wanna do this."

35:50.191 --> 35:52.889
- You only talk about feelings.
- That's how you--

35:52.933 --> 35:54.674
that's--that's what it's about.
- You're in charge of the way--

35:54.717 --> 35:57.198
of the dialogues
that we all get to have?

35:57.242 --> 36:00.680
What if we wanna just have
a fun, light, easy dinner?

36:02.116 --> 36:04.640
Okay, we can do that.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.599
This conversation is unproductive.

36:06.642 --> 36:09.210
It's not going anywhere and what
I'm processing personally

36:09.254 --> 36:12.822
is more important than worrying
about Heather and I.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.434
Like, it's just too much
for me to take on right now.

36:15.477 --> 36:18.567
Okay, guys...

36:18.611 --> 36:21.440
we are leaving tomorrow.

36:21.483 --> 36:23.224
Can we just have some fun
for a minute?

36:23.268 --> 36:25.835
Uh-huh. I'm so down for that.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.315
Okay. Lisa?

36:27.359 --> 36:28.708
I'm in.

36:28.751 --> 36:29.535
Okay.

36:29.578 --> 36:32.364
I'm always in.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.279
So this is here
if you guys wanna...

36:34.322 --> 36:35.541
- Oh, thank you.
- ...finish it off.

36:35.584 --> 36:36.846
- Love it. Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.065
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

36:38.108 --> 36:40.328
This is not Utah.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.375
So true.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.594
Mmm. I'm hungry, though.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.727
<i>Coming up...</i>

36:47.770 --> 36:51.078
Do you guys think Stuart's
gonna testify against her?

36:51.121 --> 36:54.734
Odds are... he's...

36:54.777 --> 36:57.171
definitely not on her side.

37:05.179 --> 37:09.662
Oh, my.
We do have cheesecake left?

37:14.536 --> 37:15.972
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

37:16.016 --> 37:19.106
Hi. I have gifts for everybody.

37:19.149 --> 37:21.326
Thank you.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.067
- This is for me? Thank you.
- That's for you, my love.

37:24.111 --> 37:27.201
Okay.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.985
I'm sneak peeking.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.987
- Ooh, I love this!
- Effin', bee, eye.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.511
Well, I think we pull up
the bottom and say...

37:32.554 --> 37:35.862
FBI. FBI.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.429
- FBI.
- Wait, what does it say?

37:37.472 --> 37:38.517
I can't see.

37:40.954 --> 37:45.306
If you guys think that I'm
feeding evidence to the FBI...

37:45.350 --> 37:47.265
That's what they--
they're telling me.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.875
That's----ing insane.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.616
I'm so flattered
that these women

37:50.659 --> 37:53.314
think I'm more powerful
than the FBI,

37:53.358 --> 37:57.318
but I think they could find
Jennifer Shah without my help.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.625
Has Jen seen this?

37:59.668 --> 38:03.759
Ef... bee, eye.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.457
I love it.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.546
- Yes.
- Did she die laughing?

38:07.589 --> 38:09.678
- Yeah.
- With everything she's facing,

38:09.722 --> 38:12.942
she really did come
and just... danced and...

38:12.986 --> 38:15.597
- I don't--I couldn't--She--
- ...spread rosé.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.207
She literally
can compartmentalize.

38:17.251 --> 38:20.123
- I couldn't do it.
- She's remarkable in that...

38:20.167 --> 38:21.951
- Yeah.
- ...aspect for sure.

38:24.040 --> 38:27.348
Watching her strength and how
confident she is in everything,

38:27.392 --> 38:30.395
it makes me feel like
she's gonna have a good outcome.

38:30.438 --> 38:34.747
Well, what is a good outcome?
Just acquittal first day?

38:34.790 --> 38:36.270
Proven innocent after a week?

38:36.314 --> 38:37.750
I don't even know how
this works.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.882
I don't think anything's
gonna happen first day.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.406
I know, but it's like, I don't
even know what to expect.

38:41.449 --> 38:43.016
I mean, that's very ambitious.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.888
Like, based on everything
we're seeing in the news

38:45.932 --> 38:48.413
of her co-defendants
and people that are pleading,

38:48.456 --> 38:50.328
does it make you nervous?

38:51.633 --> 38:53.679
It makes me terrified.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.771
Okay. Did she seem terrified?

38:58.814 --> 39:00.120
- Yeah?
- Yes, at times,

39:00.163 --> 39:03.515
and at other times,
she seems completely,

39:03.558 --> 39:07.475
um... compartmentalized
like it's not even existing.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.782
And then when the lines
bleed a little bit, you know,

39:09.825 --> 39:11.131
and she's kind of
in that crossover

39:11.174 --> 39:13.133
where it's vulnerable
and hard to talk about,

39:13.176 --> 39:14.961
that's, like, what's
the most heartbreaking

39:15.004 --> 39:18.268
because it's easier sometimes
to be, like,

39:18.312 --> 39:22.272
strong and angry than it is
to just be afraid.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.405
I think Jen is scared,
and I don't think she's

39:24.449 --> 39:25.885
ever really felt fear before,

39:25.928 --> 39:27.669
so she doesn't know how
to talk about it,

39:27.713 --> 39:29.062
and she doesn't know how
to express it,

39:29.105 --> 39:33.327
but... I think she is afraid.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.721
Is it bad that she's
the last one left?

39:35.764 --> 39:37.157
In terms of the trial, yeah,
uh, but--

39:37.200 --> 39:39.159
Is she still eligible
for a plea deal?

39:39.202 --> 39:41.074
I mean, you can always make
a plea deal.

39:41.117 --> 39:43.555
The problem is when you're
talking to the government

39:43.598 --> 39:45.208
and asking them to make a deal,

39:45.252 --> 39:46.819
they wanna know what
you're giving them in return,

39:46.862 --> 39:49.822
and usually,
it's for the bigger fish.

39:49.865 --> 39:52.390
Is Jen the bigger fish?

39:52.433 --> 39:55.654
I don't know. I have no idea.
You know?

39:55.697 --> 39:59.353
Do you guys think Stuart's
gonna testify against her?

39:59.397 --> 40:03.357
Stuart actually pled
to an additional charge.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.664
- What was that?
- So, like, he had 70.

40:05.707 --> 40:08.014
- Wait. How do you know this?
- I read it in the news.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.972
Wait a second. Wait a second.

40:10.016 --> 40:11.626
If he has pled guilty,

40:11.670 --> 40:14.499
knowing that he could
serve 30 years, what changes?

40:14.542 --> 40:18.024
What information he furnishes?
What type of testimony he gives?

40:18.067 --> 40:20.156
Well, just taking a guilty plea,

40:20.200 --> 40:21.680
they're going to give you
less time,

40:21.723 --> 40:24.552
because that's ownership
of what you did.

40:24.596 --> 40:26.206
But him taking the plea,

40:26.249 --> 40:28.121
I doesn't necessarily mean
that that's bad for Jen.

40:28.164 --> 40:29.731
That, like, could be
a good thing

40:29.775 --> 40:32.125
'cause he's admitting guilt.

40:32.168 --> 40:34.693
Um...

40:34.736 --> 40:37.130
odds are...

40:37.173 --> 40:42.265
he's... definitely...
not on her side.

40:44.093 --> 40:46.531
He was so dedicated
to their friendship

40:46.574 --> 40:49.185
and so dedicated to her.

40:49.229 --> 40:54.495
I mean, did you--would you ever
imagine that he had it in him...

40:59.544 --> 41:01.894
...to testify against her?

41:05.158 --> 41:07.073
Like, can you imagine if she's
sitting in that courtroom,

41:07.116 --> 41:09.423
and he has to come, like,
take the witness stand?

41:09.467 --> 41:13.558
Imagine her having
to face Stuart and have him

41:13.601 --> 41:16.735
plead guilty to things
that she's innocent of.

41:16.778 --> 41:21.522
I cannot fathom that she's
taking this whole thing to trial

41:21.566 --> 41:23.089
and doesn't have a good defense.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.265
The conviction rate

41:25.308 --> 41:27.397
in the Southern District
of New York is extremely high.

41:27.441 --> 41:33.360
It is 98%, which is, you know,
alarming and concerning.

41:33.403 --> 41:36.189
So her statistics
aren't good here.

41:36.232 --> 41:38.452
They are just not good.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.542
I can't imagine going
through this. I really can't.

41:41.586 --> 41:43.936
Um, I'm gonna go to bed,

41:43.979 --> 41:47.548
but I think overall
Jen had fun.

41:47.592 --> 41:52.248
I wish she was here.
I miss her already.

41:52.292 --> 41:54.468
- I think it meant a lot to her.
- I do, too.

42:03.738 --> 42:07.263
<i>Next time on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

42:10.179 --> 42:12.530
Opening Ceremonies, bitches.

42:12.573 --> 42:17.012
I've actually had a boyfriend
for the past two years.

42:17.056 --> 42:19.580
The judge is pushing
the trial out till July.

42:20.973 --> 42:23.976
I'm just tired of people
questioning my innocence.

42:24.019 --> 42:25.238
Our time is coming.

42:25.281 --> 42:27.283
I just don't think
Heather realizes

42:27.327 --> 42:29.982
the magnitude
of what I went through.

42:30.025 --> 42:33.812
You took my pain
and weaponized it against me.

42:33.855 --> 42:36.510
It felt like it was
all about you.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.164
- Hello!
- How are you, gorgeous?

42:38.207 --> 42:40.035
What is Angie Harrington
doing here?

42:40.079 --> 42:42.298
It's like, stab you in the back,
kiss you on the cheek.

42:42.342 --> 42:47.608
Hey, could we talk?
Let's go over here. Let's talk.

42:47.652 --> 42:50.437
Angie, to be honest,
I'm not really interested.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.178
- Like, more lies.
- Well, tell me what

42:52.221 --> 42:54.006
the lies are that you think
I've said.

42:54.049 --> 42:55.616
- Oh, there's so many, Angie.
- No, no--

42:55.660 --> 42:58.314
It's too much to count. I'm not
really interested. Sorry.
