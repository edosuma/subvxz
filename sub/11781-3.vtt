00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.078
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.779
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.812 --> 00:12.780
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.382
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.185
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:17.218 --> 00:20.121
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.290
Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:22.323 --> 00:25.093
Make no mistake
about it.
I expect perfection.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.094
And you will not
make mistakes.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.195
Have I made myself clear?

00:27.228 --> 00:29.330
Yes.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.531
Winter Formal here.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.533
Preview party here.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.203
I'll take a spin
around the dance floor,

00:35.236 --> 00:38.072
quick change in the bathroom,
and then race over in time to
prep for the fashion preview.

00:38.106 --> 00:38.439
Gorgeous.
Whose is it?

00:38.472 --> 00:40.374
It's mine.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.008
Yeah, who designed it?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.244
JANE: I designed it.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.480
I think you might be
cut out for the fashion
business after all.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.249
See you
in the office, Jane.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.284
BILLY: Win the guy.
Impress the boss.

00:50.318 --> 00:50.651
What could possibly
go wrong?

01:01.129 --> 01:03.664
JANE: Rivalries
in fashion are the rule,
not the exception.

01:05.866 --> 01:09.570
Armani vs. Wintour,
Valentino vs. Dolce & Gabbana.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.372
The list goes on and on.

01:14.342 --> 01:17.545
But do our rivals
give us something
we least expect?

01:19.247 --> 01:21.382
Do they,
in some small way,

01:21.415 --> 01:24.418
teach us who it is
we really are?

01:37.398 --> 01:41.402
* I've my heart where
my head should be

01:41.435 --> 01:44.638
* Light up the rest of me

01:44.672 --> 01:47.375
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

01:47.408 --> 01:50.244
* Through the stops,
the starts

01:50.278 --> 01:53.181
* And life is a work of art

01:56.450 --> 01:57.485
Can you believe it?

01:57.518 --> 02:01.155
No. I can't.
What is it I can't
believe, again?

02:01.189 --> 02:02.623
"Beau Bronn has
done it again,

02:02.656 --> 02:04.925
"imbuing his latest line
with a collection of

02:04.958 --> 02:08.896
"stunning, nature-inspired
boho-chic accessories
from around the globe."

02:08.929 --> 02:12.166
But we did nature-inspired
boho-chic accessories.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.934
Try to keep up, Jane.
It's sabotage.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.237
But I don't understand.
Why would someone do that?

02:16.270 --> 02:19.273
Because Beau Bronn
is the spawn of Satan.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.574
The man has been
a thorn in my side

02:20.608 --> 02:22.343
ever since we met
back at Parsons.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.214
He's kind of handsome.

02:27.415 --> 02:30.718
For a very, very
not handsome guy.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.286
Actually,
on second glance,

02:32.320 --> 02:33.454
he kind of
looks despicable.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.723
He is.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.325
Have you ever
had that, Jane?

02:37.358 --> 02:40.394
Someone who feels like
they were put in your life
just to make you miserable?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.233
* Don't you

02:45.266 --> 02:46.700
* Don't you wanna ruin it

see me flaunt

What are you doing?

03:07.988 --> 03:10.358
What do you
want me to do?

03:10.391 --> 03:12.726
We talked about this, Lu.
It's over.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.695
You always say that,
you never mean it.

03:14.728 --> 03:18.599
Yeah, well,
this time I do.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.735
Come on, Billy.
It was just a fight.
Don't be such a downer.

03:21.769 --> 03:22.903
It was more than
a fight, Lulu.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.624
I got it at the
secondhand store

03:43.657 --> 03:45.393

really cute...

Well, it won't do.
Not for my assistant.

says who you are

03:49.530 --> 03:52.266

that bag says things,
well, that I don't care
to repeat.

says that you,

04:06.747 --> 04:09.016
It's gorgeous.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.484

for the time being.

I won't be back
until late tomorrow.

about the trunk show?

Yes. Yes, I did.

New York society.

offered your townhouse

Good.

the clothing.

the door and
greet the caterers.

But most important of all,

04:46.554 --> 04:49.457
do not let anything
happen to my house.
Can you handle that, Jane?

04:49.490 --> 04:50.658
Yes. Yes, I can.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.427
Take care of
the things on this list
before I get back.

It looks like a purse.

Okay.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.760
I don't know
what that means,

05:26.794 --> 05:28.462

it has some sort

05:28.496 --> 05:29.830
of cool, secret

hired his cousin?

No, this job is much,
much better than that.

For what?

06:03.831 --> 06:06.900
Shotgun!

06:06.934 --> 06:08.936
Why did your brother
just call shotgun?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.504
Because

06:10.538 --> 06:13.541
he is the new assistant

10:44.011 --> 10:45.679
You're not in here
because of me, okay?

10:45.713 --> 10:47.080
I'm as in the dark
as you are.

10:47.114 --> 10:52.920
Relax. Nobody's in trouble,
just... Lulu, take a seat.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.689
Vice Principal Jenkins
has something he wants
to tell you both.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.157
Mid-year class rankings
are being posted today,

10:57.190 --> 11:00.994
and I'm happy
to tell you that
Lulu is number one.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.098
And Jane is
also number one.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.000
We have a tie!

11:07.901 --> 11:09.169
A freaking tie?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.838
How is that possible?

11:10.871 --> 11:12.105
At this level,
the differences

11:12.139 --> 11:13.841
in grade point average
are minimal.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.143
You're essentially
neck and neck.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.012
Which doesn't mean
you two should go crazy
on some sort of competition.

11:19.046 --> 11:19.747
I know your relationship
has been rocky.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.014
That's one way
of putting it.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.449
This isn't
that big of a deal.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.884
Of course
it's a big deal.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.820
One of you could be
our valedictorian.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.890
Maybe, maybe not, who knows?
There's no way to tell.
From this point forward...

11:29.923 --> 11:32.159
Every little test counts.
Every quiz...

11:32.192 --> 11:33.794
RITA: Maybe not every quiz.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.963
Any fluctuation puts
one of you on top.

11:35.996 --> 11:40.901
Or not. I just...
I hope you'll take it
easy on each other.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.736
I know this rivalry thing
has gotten heated
in the past,

11:42.770 --> 11:45.873
and I'm sure
this development
doesn't help.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.009
But I'm asking you
to not let this
get personal.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.077
Are we clear?

11:50.110 --> 11:52.212
Fine by me.

11:52.245 --> 11:56.917
Of course.
As top students
here at Whitemarsh,

11:56.950 --> 12:00.053
we can, and will,
demonstrate
exemplary behavior.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.989
You can count on us.

12:02.022 --> 12:02.890
Yes, we can!

12:04.858 --> 12:08.962
Good to know.
All right. Scram.
The both of you.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.764
We have guidance
that must be doled

12:10.798 --> 12:12.065
and principaling
that must be viced.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.337
You're not helping.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.944
Well. I guess...

12:23.977 --> 12:26.113
May the best woman win.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.781
Oh, I will.
You can count on it.

12:27.815 --> 12:31.785
You and me?
It's on, Quimby.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.989
Nice fake Birkin.

12:39.927 --> 12:40.760
It's real.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.572
That exam is one sixth
of our grade.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.075
I mean, really.
I might as well hand Lulu
number one on a platter.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.110
There's no way
I'm gonna find time
to study for this test.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.246
Says who?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.815
Says this list.

13:01.849 --> 13:02.249
Oh!

13:02.282 --> 13:03.917
Thanks to Gray.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.353
"Break up with Brad"?

13:06.386 --> 13:07.888
Don't ask.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.359
Do you see that?
She's psyching me out already.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.861
That girl is relentless.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.963
Just forget about Lulu.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.998
(SCOFFS)
It's easy for you to say.
She's not all over you.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.270
(PHONE VIBRATES)

13:39.152 --> 13:41.054
And how exactly is it
that I made it here
before you?

13:44.657 --> 13:45.292
Lower your voice.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.895
What? Are you ashamed of me?

13:47.928 --> 13:49.930
Very funny.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.067
(SIGHS) Thank you.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.202
What did take you
so long to get in
this morning?

13:55.235 --> 13:57.871
I left your place
at the exact
same time you did.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.040
Can you please
keep your voice down?

14:00.073 --> 14:02.142
Clearly you don't care
about your reputation,
but I do.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.244
I happen to be very proud
of my reputation.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.279
Hmm. I'm sure you are.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.449
Wow, you are
in a foul mood
this morning.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.052
I'm sorry.

14:12.986 --> 14:13.586
I should go now.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.356
Yo! Hey, what's going on?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.963
Nothing.

14:22.996 --> 14:23.763
Come on, India.
Something's going on.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.166
Surely you can tell me,
can't you?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.368
It's Gray. Okay?
Are you happy now?

14:28.401 --> 14:31.271
No matter what I do,
I will never earn
that woman's respect.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.173
(SCOFFS) That's not true.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.309
Come on,
she accused me of
trying to take her job.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.311
Yeah, well, technically,
you did try to...

14:38.345 --> 14:39.412
That's not the point.

14:39.446 --> 14:42.082
Do you know how
Gray got to where
she is today?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.084
I've heard stories, yeah.

14:44.117 --> 14:47.154
Exactly. I was her
assistant back then,
and it wasn't pretty.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.189
Gray didn't get
to the top
by being nice

14:49.222 --> 14:51.258
or playing by the rules.

14:51.291 --> 14:55.695
She was relentless,
ruthless, and
completely fearless.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.663
But now...

14:56.696 --> 14:57.664
Now, when I show those
very same qualities,

14:57.697 --> 15:01.701
when I use those tools,
she punishes me for it.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.271
In fairness, maybe
Gray didn't think that

15:04.304 --> 15:07.374
you'd use
the tools she gave you
against her one day.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.178
You know what?
I'm not gonna
apologize. Mmm-mmm.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.081
I took a page out of
Gray's book, the way
she taught me to.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.716
And who does
she reward? Jane.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.252
Maybe you should just,
I don't know, talk to her?

15:19.286 --> 15:20.320
Jane?

15:20.353 --> 15:23.023
No. To Gray.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.358
Why not have a real,
honest to goodness
conversation

15:25.392 --> 15:26.059
about what happened
with her,

15:26.093 --> 15:27.460
maybe you'll
get somewhere.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.399
That's ridiculous.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.069
Yeah, I'm sure
the whole ruthless angle
will work just as well.

15:48.215 --> 15:51.118
Jane, I can't talk
right now. The auction
is about to start, and...

15:51.151 --> 15:54.988
You. India.
What do you want?

15:55.022 --> 15:59.159
I 'd like to make things
right between us, Gray.
I know I made a mistake...

15:59.192 --> 16:02.262
Mistake? Is that
what you call it?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.997
You tried to take my job.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.999
Like I said, a mistake.

16:06.033 --> 16:09.502
If anything, you should
take it as a compliment.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.271
Excuse me?

16:11.304 --> 16:14.107
I admire you, Gray.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.044
I aspire to be you
in every way.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.411
And maybe,
in pursuit of that,

16:18.445 --> 16:22.049
I got a little carried away.

16:22.082 --> 16:25.418
Nice try.
But I'm not buying
what you're selling.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.787
I'm being honest, Gray.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.357
I've always looked up to you.

16:30.390 --> 16:35.095
It wasn't that long ago
that it was me
in here beside you.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.563
I was your Jane.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.464
Oh, India, how sweet.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.401
But you're no Jane.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.372
(SIGHS)

16:56.516 --> 16:58.251
Oh, hello, darling.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.286
Beau.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.455
What? Not happy to see me?

17:02.489 --> 17:05.158
After the little stunt
you pulled last week.
You stole my line.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.060
Honestly, Gray,
I would never do
such a thing.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.295
What are you doing here?

17:08.328 --> 17:09.796
Well, the same as you.
I'm here for
the auction tonight.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.598
No, what are you
doing here
in my hotel room?

17:11.631 --> 17:13.433
Oh, I just thought
I'd stop by, and...

17:13.466 --> 17:14.301
And what?

17:14.334 --> 17:16.436
And give you these.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.575
You didn't sign them.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.612
I couldn't find my pen.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.045
Why are you
doing this to me?

17:26.079 --> 17:28.615
You know why.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.450
Sign the divorce
papers, Beau.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.388
JANE: He's so over me.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.457
It's like Nick and I had
this moment at the dance

17:37.490 --> 17:39.826
where something
might have happened
between us, you know,

17:39.859 --> 17:43.363
something real,
and now, it's just gone.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.398
He hasn't spoken to me
once since that dance.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.567
Do you think
it's totally hopeless?

17:50.137 --> 17:51.504
Are you paying attention?

17:51.538 --> 17:53.106
Sorry. What?

17:53.140 --> 17:55.108
Just tell me what
I should do about Nick.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.144
Honestly?
I don't know, Janey.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.845
I mean, if things are
this complicated,

17:58.878 --> 18:04.584
maybe it's just
not meant to be.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.321
Maybe you're too different.
Maybe your lives
just don't quite mesh.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.124
You know?

18:11.158 --> 18:12.525
You've really given this
a lot of thought.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.398
You know what?
You're probably right.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.167
Like Nick was ever
gonna go for me.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.235
I was crazy to think
that that would happen.

18:23.370 --> 18:24.003
Anyway, I've got to
get to work.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.406
Are you sure
you're okay?

18:26.439 --> 18:29.242
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll see you later.

18:29.276 --> 18:33.146
* At night I'll hold your hand
and never leave you
in the dark

18:33.180 --> 18:37.550
* Come on
I know a better way to go... *

18:39.486 --> 18:42.189
I'm sure he'll be
proud of you, Lulu.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.225
You don't know my father.
He'll just say, "Study more,
add another AP class.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.559
"Work harder."

18:46.593 --> 18:48.495
You're ranked first
in your class.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.796
No. I'm tied.

18:49.829 --> 18:53.166
And tied for number one
isn't the same as
being number one.

18:53.200 --> 18:53.733
Not to my father.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.702
I could give him a call.

18:55.735 --> 18:59.372
It won't help.
But thanks, Miss Shaw.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.722
So, tonight?
Same time, my place?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.292
What? No dinner first?

19:20.527 --> 19:23.363
Very funny.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.299
You know, I may look
cheap and easy,
but I have feelings, too.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.701
What do you take me for?

19:28.735 --> 19:31.604
For someone who,
like me, wants to
keep things simple.

19:31.638 --> 19:32.739
Am I wrong?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.341
You are

19:34.374 --> 19:35.275
100% correct.

19:37.677 --> 19:41.214
* Dancing into the daylight

19:41.248 --> 19:42.181
JANE: Excuse me.
Coming through.

19:42.215 --> 19:46.353
* Standing under the spotlight
with you

19:46.386 --> 19:49.489
* With you I feel like
a million-dollar... *

19:49.522 --> 19:50.623
So, tonight?

19:50.657 --> 19:52.392
You know what? Forget it.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.665
That's five
dozen peonies.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.236
Out of season?
No, no, no, no.

20:03.270 --> 20:03.970
They can't be
out of season.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.507
Can you just...
Great. Now this.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.641
Hello, India.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.742
Jane.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.711
Hi, no. Yes.
Sorry, I'm still here.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.415
Is there any flower
that can be made
to look like a peony?

20:16.549 --> 20:20.320
No? Okay.
Thanks a lot.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.255
Out of season
flowers, huh?

20:22.289 --> 20:23.122
That was always
one of my favorites.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.392
I always thought
she did it on purpose.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.361
Gray and her lists.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.629
Is there something
I can help you with?

20:29.662 --> 20:32.765
No. But I can help you.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.267
You may be Gray's
new favorite now,

20:34.301 --> 20:39.506
but you screw up one thing
on that list of hers,
and you're off her list.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.275
People like you and me,
we're nothing to Gray.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.411
We're disposable.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.512
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.280
Sure you do.

20:47.314 --> 20:51.584
No, I don't.
Gray likes me.
I know she does.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.753
In fact, just yesterday,
she gave me this bag.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.289
It's a Birkin. Yeah.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.757
And you know,
you don't give
somebody a bag like this

20:57.790 --> 20:59.392
unless you like them,
you know?

20:59.426 --> 21:01.394
Unless you think
they're doing a good job.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.562
Which I am.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.697
You think that bag
means something?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.799
Well, it doesn't.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.701
And I got a 2009
Chanel clutch to prove it.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.805
Trust me, Jane.
It won't last.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.775
We'll see about that.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.577
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21:17.610 --> 21:20.279
I have a trunk show to plan
and some more errands to do.

21:21.348 --> 21:21.814
(SIGHS)

21:23.550 --> 21:24.651
Hmm.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.754
(SIGHS)
You're right, Jane.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.624
We will see about that.

21:50.677 --> 21:51.778
(EXHALES)

21:57.450 --> 21:58.918
* Hey

all of this stuff done
in time on my own.

Come on in.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.709
So, as I mentioned
on the phone,

24:02.742 --> 24:05.712
I work for Gray, and...

24:05.745 --> 24:07.914
What... What is this place?

24:09.916 --> 24:12.485
BRAD: Oh, it's
a model apartment.

24:12.519 --> 24:13.886
The agency puts us
all up together.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.988
Oh! So, you're all models?

24:16.889 --> 24:17.690
Male models?

24:17.724 --> 24:20.527
Every one of us.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.697
Oh, all living together.
That's so nice.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.933
Um, listen, I should
probably just,

24:26.966 --> 24:29.936
you know, get
to the point here.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.572
I have to be at
a trunk show in, like...

24:32.605 --> 24:36.643
You're not cold without
your shirt on, are you?

24:36.676 --> 24:37.076
No. Okay.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.879
Um, Brad, I'm...

24:39.912 --> 24:42.749
I'm so sorry
to be the one
to tell you this,

24:42.782 --> 24:45.818
but the thing
with you and Gray?
It's over.

24:46.619 --> 24:47.654
Over?

24:47.687 --> 24:48.921
I'm really sorry.

24:48.955 --> 24:49.856
Did she say how over?

24:49.889 --> 24:52.659
She didn't really
give me a percentage.

24:52.692 --> 24:53.593
So, it's not definite?

24:53.626 --> 24:54.827
Uh, well, I...

24:54.861 --> 24:57.530
No, no, Jane, Jane.
It can't be over.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.065
Just the other night
she told me that she loved me.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.668
Uh, really?
She said that?

25:01.701 --> 25:03.936
Well, she said,
"I love you in that shirt."

25:03.970 --> 25:06.639
But, there was still
an "I love you" in there.

25:06.673 --> 25:09.709
I had been waiting for that.
Gosh darn it.

25:09.742 --> 25:13.079
Brad, look, a guy
like you, with all

25:13.112 --> 25:14.280
that going on.

25:14.313 --> 25:17.584
You could have
any girl you want.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.751
You're a catch.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.654
And if Gray can't
see that about you,

25:21.688 --> 25:23.856
then you'll just
have to show her how
wrong she was about you.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.758
You really think so?

25:25.792 --> 25:26.826
I do.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.629

26:03.630 --> 26:04.997
How was your day, Ben?

26:05.031 --> 26:07.700
It was a little weird
being back here and all.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.602
Do you think
it's weird for Jane
to have me here?

26:09.636 --> 26:10.937
Probably.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.072
I mean, look at it
from her perspective.
You're her brother,

26:13.105 --> 26:15.341
but you're also
her guardian.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.644
She's gonna be

Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

these feelings about...

you over, Rita Shaw.

27:03.055 --> 27:06.959
Does it look like I wear
an actual size to you?

27:06.993 --> 27:09.862
I'm really sorry,
we don't have
a double zero,

27:09.896 --> 27:12.131

oversight on our part.

help, though.

just put your hair out.

a look at that.

told me to do, Jane.

anywhere, Jane.

it's sort of weird for me
to wait up in her room?

I guess we were
just too different.

take her roller skating.

backwards skate.

I'm actually
looking for Jane.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.352
What's so great about Jane?

33:06.385 --> 33:08.320
Yeah, but do you know
where she is?

33:08.354 --> 33:09.488
There you are!

33:09.521 --> 33:11.290
Janey, nice party.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.225
I have no idea
how this happened.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.194
And Gray is less
than an hour away.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.596
I'm totally and
completely screwed.

33:22.101 --> 33:23.602
I have no idea
how to get rid of
all of these people!

33:24.436 --> 33:26.272

Oh, I'm on it.

Oh, God...

Hello, Gray.
How was your trip?

Gray, I'm so sorry.
But... Oh, gosh!

36:19.478 --> 36:20.212
He wouldn't take
no for an answer.

36:22.781 --> 36:23.181
Hey, cupcake.

36:42.768 --> 36:43.402
Thanks.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.772
All-night study session, huh?

36:46.805 --> 36:49.275
Uh, yeah. Totally.

36:49.308 --> 36:53.479
It was a very, very
long night of studying.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.348
I remember this bad boy.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.984
Put me to sleep
many a night, too.

36:59.017 --> 37:00.986
So how's the
internship going?

37:01.019 --> 37:02.654
Not getting in the way
of class, is it?

37:02.688 --> 37:06.358
Nope. Everything's good.

37:06.392 --> 37:09.261
I'm sorry if I was
weird about you coming
to work at school.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.498
It's fine. I get it.

37:12.531 --> 37:14.266
To be honest,
it's kind of weird
for me having you there.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.401
Really?

37:15.434 --> 37:18.337
No. I kind of like it.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.839
I'm happy that
you're happy.

37:21.407 --> 37:24.276
And I think...

37:24.310 --> 37:26.278
I know it's the perfect
job for you.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.381
Look, I realize

37:29.415 --> 37:31.817
it's a little awkward
for you having me there.

37:31.850 --> 37:35.421
No, it's...
You know what?

37:35.454 --> 37:38.824
Before today,
Billy was the only one
I had at that school

37:38.857 --> 37:40.692
and now I have you
there, too. It's nice.

37:46.398 --> 37:51.437
All right. If sine theta
equals three fifths,
what is cosine theta?

37:51.470 --> 37:54.740
The cosine theta is...

37:54.773 --> 37:56.608
Ugh! I have no idea.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.577
We'll come back
to that one, huh?

37:58.610 --> 38:02.448
You know what?
I'm not even gonna
write my name on this test.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.248
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You really should.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.851
That's three points
right there.

38:05.884 --> 38:09.388
Oh, come on.
You're fine, Janey.
All right?

38:09.421 --> 38:12.558
You're gonna pull some
totally obscure equation
out of nowhere

38:12.591 --> 38:15.461
and save yourself
from pre-calc fatality.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.763
Trust me. Just have
a little faith, kid.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.598
It's all up here.

38:19.631 --> 38:23.469
I know. I'm just tired.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.771
I mean, between
work and school

38:25.804 --> 38:27.373
and keeping up
some semblance
of a social life.

38:27.406 --> 38:31.543
Shut up.
I said semblance.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.479
I don't know.
I just feel...

38:33.512 --> 38:34.112
Spread thin?

38:34.145 --> 38:35.881
Yes.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.818
And there's that.

38:39.851 --> 38:43.389
She's perfect
and smart
and beautiful

38:43.422 --> 38:45.524
and totally ready
to crush me on this test.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.494
You know what I think?

38:48.527 --> 38:49.895
What?

38:49.928 --> 38:52.764
I think that maybe,
just maybe,

38:52.798 --> 38:54.633
Lulu Pope is a little
stressed out, too.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.537
Now, I know that Lulu
has gone out of her way

38:58.570 --> 39:01.573
to be not so nice to you
all the time, Janey,

39:01.607 --> 39:02.908
but sometimes
there's more going on
with people than we realize.

39:02.941 --> 39:05.644
You of all people
should get that.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.546
You're right.

39:07.579 --> 39:10.449
I mean, maybe in some
weird parallel universe,

39:10.482 --> 39:12.684
Lulu and I actually have
something in common?

39:13.552 --> 39:15.887
Yeah, maybe you do.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.423
All right, there's
no more avoiding it.
