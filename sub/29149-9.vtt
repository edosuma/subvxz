00:02.160 --> 00:04.103
- Uh-huh.
- Former cruise employee,

00:04.104 --> 00:05.743
James Wiesel in accounting,

00:05.744 --> 00:08.201
seems to have gotten spooked. And...

00:08.202 --> 00:10.136
seems like he might be about to talk.

00:10.137 --> 00:11.537
I thought we had this all sewn up.

00:11.538 --> 00:14.618
- I said I'd hoped.
- Don't... Interrupt me.

00:14.619 --> 00:17.284
Have you talked to your
dad about a major injection

00:17.285 --> 00:19.794
or even taking us private?

00:19.795 --> 00:21.826
It's a conversation we can have.

00:21.827 --> 00:24.743
To Bill, the best boss that ever lived.

00:24.744 --> 00:27.987
So I'm gonna create a
word document for you,

00:27.988 --> 00:30.868
and then I'm gonna print it
because I don't want anything

00:30.869 --> 00:32.241
with my handwriting on it.

00:32.243 --> 00:35.068
I think Rhea is dangerous, and
I think we need to stop her.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.384
We need to put feelings
aside and call a family truce.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.391
So we made the second threat-slash-offer

00:39.392 --> 00:40.868
to Mr. Wiesel, and he said, "No.

00:40.869 --> 00:42.618
The new face is gonna
get ripped to shreds."

00:42.619 --> 00:46.559
I really am wondering about
Rhea. Have I got her right?

00:46.560 --> 00:47.560
She's the one.

00:48.118 --> 00:51.284
I shall be appointing Rhea Jarrell

00:51.285 --> 00:54.034
as my Chief Executive Officer.

00:54.035 --> 00:57.285
This empire of shit, time to pay up.

01:28.869 --> 01:30.618
Good evening. I'm Susan Vardy,

01:30.619 --> 01:33.800
and in focus tonight,
an exclusive interview

01:33.801 --> 01:36.951
with Waystar Royco
whistleblower James Weissel.

01:37.993 --> 01:40.334
Sexual exploitation, violence, theft,

01:40.335 --> 01:42.701
plus, a host of other
crimes, all of it hidden

01:42.702 --> 01:44.576
by cover-ups and corruption

01:44.577 --> 01:46.159
- to avoid damaging headlines...
- Cha-ching.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.910
- Book deal, book deal!
- That's what my guest

01:47.911 --> 01:51.201
alleges went on for
decades inside Brightstar,

01:51.202 --> 01:54.409
America's second-largest
cruise line operator.

01:54.410 --> 01:58.117
So, James, you witnessed some
terrible things at Brightstar.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.826
What disturbed you the most?

01:59.827 --> 02:01.201
Well, Susan...

02:01.202 --> 02:02.910
"Well, Susan, I'm a piece of shit.

02:02.911 --> 02:04.785
- I'm a weasel, and I'm scared."
- Brightstar Cruises was,

02:04.786 --> 02:07.868
for decades, a cesspool
of mismanagement...

02:07.869 --> 02:13.117
and millions and millions of
dollars paid out over decades

02:13.118 --> 02:18.201
to cover up sexual
exploitation and harassment

02:18.202 --> 02:22.103
by Brightstar employees, and a lot of it

02:22.104 --> 02:25.201
actually committed by the man
in charge, Lester McClintock.

02:25.202 --> 02:27.209
- Uncle Mo.
- Mo McClintock.

02:27.210 --> 02:29.094
- Who could forget our Mo?
- Then you have even more

02:29.095 --> 02:32.284
serious incidents occurring
outside of U.S. jurisdiction.

02:32.285 --> 02:36.868
Guests overboard, injury,
and, uh, unexplained deaths.

02:36.869 --> 02:39.326
And what are you saying
about these incidents,

02:39.327 --> 02:41.534
including passengers overboard?

02:41.535 --> 02:43.266
- I don't know everything.
- Oh!

02:43.267 --> 02:44.910
He doesn't know everything now.

02:44.911 --> 02:46.701
But I know what the stories were,

02:46.702 --> 02:48.910
and I do know that
there was no appetite...

02:48.911 --> 02:50.534
Yeah, where's the proof, Ruth?

02:50.535 --> 02:53.076
... whatsoever from
the senior management

02:53.077 --> 02:54.910
- for uncovering the truth.
- Oh, yeah.

02:54.911 --> 02:56.910
Yeah, who's backing you, weasel? Hm?

02:56.911 --> 02:58.826
- You're saying there were cover-ups?
- Absolutely.

02:58.827 --> 03:01.701
And people, people off
the ship, the company HQ,

03:01.702 --> 03:04.409
did they know this sort
of cover-up was going on?

03:04.410 --> 03:08.117
Well, there was there a certain
amount of oversight, um...

03:08.118 --> 03:09.466
Gerri Kellman...

03:09.467 --> 03:12.158
- Gerri!
- Gerri Kellman, the Waystar general counsel.

03:12.159 --> 03:15.551
- Gerri alert!
- ... saying no bad PR

03:15.552 --> 03:16.951
- was the priority.
- Yeah, Gerri!

03:16.952 --> 03:19.564
That, um, senior management
was to be protected.

03:19.565 --> 03:22.951
And that went on until Bill
Lockheart changed things up.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.701
- Wow! Old Bill!
- Bill Lockheart was the then-head

03:25.702 --> 03:27.284
- of parks and cruises.
- Fuck Bill.

03:27.285 --> 03:29.576
Yeah, there was a
clean up under Bill and

03:29.577 --> 03:32.419
- he reported to Kendall Roy.
- I liked Bill when we met him.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.117
- Ken!
- You know, they tried to clean things up.

03:35.118 --> 03:38.284
And, uh, recently, Tom Wambsgans...

03:38.285 --> 03:39.826
Wambsgans!

03:39.827 --> 03:41.925
I believe he tied
off a lot of loose ends.

03:41.926 --> 03:44.493
- Hey, bangin' on the Tom-Tom!
- But getting into the details a bit.

03:44.494 --> 03:45.758
- Woo, Tom!
- Nope.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.109
- Your mom and dad should be so proud.
- You mentioned this...

03:48.110 --> 03:49.861
- Yeah.
- ... phrase that occurred many times in the shadow logs.

03:49.862 --> 03:52.618
- Ooh, "shadow logs"!
- Incident: NRPI.

03:52.619 --> 03:54.992
Uh... Yeah, that's, uh...

03:54.993 --> 03:57.409
Incident: No Real Person Involved.

03:57.410 --> 03:59.451
Uh-huh, and what does that mean?

03:59.452 --> 04:01.728
That means it's a sex worker

04:01.729 --> 04:04.868
or a migrant worker at a foreign port,

04:04.869 --> 04:10.076
not involving a guest or a
permanent member of staff.

04:10.077 --> 04:12.826
No real person involved.

04:12.827 --> 04:15.288
- And these shadow logs...
- Oh, I can't watch any more of

04:15.289 --> 04:17.289
- this fucking bullshit.
- ... with the full record of these crimes.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.584
- Here you are, Connor.
- Do you know where they are?

04:18.586 --> 04:19.660
No. No, I...

04:21.327 --> 04:23.117
Dad, you okay?

04:23.118 --> 04:26.701
It's bullshit! Clearly,
Sandy's backing him. Clearly.

04:26.702 --> 04:30.868
With his buddy and his six
fucking shell companies.

04:30.869 --> 04:34.595
Sick bastards who'd
fucking do and say anything.

04:34.596 --> 04:36.034
Don't you think we should watch, though,

04:36.035 --> 04:37.660
so we can have a response?

04:37.661 --> 04:40.301
I've got 50 fucking people
paid to watch this shit.

04:40.302 --> 04:42.076
It's senior management's
duty to be in control...

04:42.077 --> 04:44.242
I don't need to see this
nonsense. We'll watch it later.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.437
... of the people it employed.

04:45.438 --> 04:47.701
Either they did know, which is terrible,

04:47.702 --> 04:51.368
or they didn't know, which
is an unconscionable...

04:51.369 --> 04:53.034
- lack of control.
- Uh-huh.

04:53.035 --> 04:55.117
Waystar representatives
declined to appear...

04:55.118 --> 04:57.201
- Uh-huh.
- ... but they did issue a statement saying,

04:57.202 --> 04:58.951
- "We are disappointed..."
- Okay, thanks for letting me know.

04:58.952 --> 05:00.493
- Yeah. 
- "... you have given airtime

05:00.494 --> 05:02.534
to these recycled and
debunked claims..."

05:02.535 --> 05:03.535
Fuck!

05:06.202 --> 05:10.201
So... bad. Bad. But, uh...

05:10.202 --> 05:11.451
Yeah, but not too bad?

05:11.452 --> 05:14.826
Bad, I think. Very bad.

05:14.827 --> 05:16.409
I would agree. Bad.

05:16.410 --> 05:18.159
Yeah, obviously, it's
fucking bad, Frank,

05:18.160 --> 05:19.701
we're talking here about how bad.

05:19.702 --> 05:22.785
Well, just from a PR perspective
I wouldn't want anyone

05:22.786 --> 05:27.868
to underplay how bad it was.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.952
These are the talking
points that we're hitting.

05:31.744 --> 05:33.034
He's embittered.

05:33.035 --> 05:35.242
He's the bad guy covering his tracks.

05:35.243 --> 05:39.618
No proof, no victim voices,
and nothing that new.

05:39.619 --> 05:40.911
Want to hear what I think?

05:42.410 --> 05:44.077
I think we say the truth.

05:48.202 --> 05:51.576
That the senior cadre
here, and the family,

05:51.577 --> 05:53.826
- knew nothing of this.
- Mm-hm.

05:53.827 --> 05:57.701
So we throw Mo overboard. Mo, bad apple.

05:57.702 --> 05:59.451
Jim Weasel, bad apple.

05:59.452 --> 06:03.076
Spies a book deal. Sotto voce,
backed by Sandy and Stewy,

06:03.077 --> 06:06.284
all corporate fuckery, no real concern.

06:06.285 --> 06:10.992
And in terms of historic shit?
I'm afraid we give up Bill.

06:10.993 --> 06:13.868
Because he should have let
us know what he discovered,

06:13.869 --> 06:17.076
rather than clean up without
telling us the details.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.160
Uh-huh.

06:21.285 --> 06:23.242
I don't think there's gonna be paper

06:23.243 --> 06:24.786
that shows anything beyond Bill.

06:25.827 --> 06:26.952
Yeah.

06:28.619 --> 06:32.034
I mean, everyone likes Bill, but...

06:32.035 --> 06:36.117
- I like Bill.
- I mean, Bill tried to clean up.

06:36.118 --> 06:38.284
I like Bill.

06:38.285 --> 06:42.827
It seems like Bill is where
the buck stops, though, right?

08:17.243 --> 08:19.202
Do we kill Bill?

08:22.243 --> 08:23.285
Yeah.

08:24.327 --> 08:26.034
So...

08:26.035 --> 08:29.702
I think I just, uh, turned down
a quarter of a billion dollars.

08:30.869 --> 08:32.409
Uh-huh.

08:32.409 --> 08:34.451
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make a drink.

08:34.452 --> 08:36.116
Uh... I think... I think I'm gonna...

08:36.118 --> 08:38.076
I... I can drink these drinks, right?

08:38.077 --> 08:39.467
These are drinks for people?

08:39.467 --> 08:41.907
Looks like there might be a
slight uptick in ticket sales.

08:41.908 --> 08:46.242
'Cause Logan... promised
he'll look after me, so...

08:46.243 --> 08:49.576
- A quarter of a billion?
- Mm-hm?

08:49.577 --> 08:52.810
- Instead, you're trusting Dad?
- What?

08:52.811 --> 08:53.917
No, I mean,

08:53.918 --> 08:56.743
my grandpa changes his mind
a lot, so it's not final.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.451
And plus, um, he's so sturdy.

08:59.452 --> 09:02.159
Like, who knows how long
I might have to wait.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.992
I'm good, anyway, 'cause, uh...

09:04.993 --> 09:08.598
My... So, I was just talking
to my mom, and she said,

09:08.599 --> 09:11.660
apparently, he'll leave
me five million anyway,

09:11.661 --> 09:13.868
so I'm golden, baby.

09:13.869 --> 09:15.951
You can't do anything with five, Greg.

09:15.952 --> 09:17.201
Five's a nightmare.

09:17.202 --> 09:18.493
Mm... Is it?

09:18.494 --> 09:23.284
Oh, yeah. Can't retire,
not worth it to work.

09:23.285 --> 09:27.284
Oh, yes. Five will drive you un poco loco

09:27.285 --> 09:28.493
my fine feathered friend.

09:28.494 --> 09:30.284
Poorest rich person in America.

09:30.285 --> 09:32.117
The world's tallest dwarf.

09:32.118 --> 09:34.284
The weakest strongman at the circus.

09:34.285 --> 09:35.951
Mm-hm.

09:35.952 --> 09:38.326
Okay, Tom? Hey. We're done,
we have a strategy, come on.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.452
Oh, okay.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.117
- Hey, Tom. You're famous.
- Hey.

09:44.118 --> 09:46.451
So, this isn't that different
from the magazine piece.

09:46.452 --> 09:49.159
The strategy is, we're
letting Bill take it.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.034
It went as far as Bill. Kill Bill.

09:52.035 --> 09:53.826
It'll blow over in 48 hours.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.660
Uh... Well, no.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.910
I'm just off the phone,
and it's definite.

09:58.911 --> 10:02.409
Either Gil or Gilliard are
going to call for hearings.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.951
- Oh, fuck. What?
- Wait a minute. What?

10:04.952 --> 10:07.826
Yeah, Senate Commerce.
Probably House, too.

10:07.827 --> 10:09.826
The staff are huddled
on how to choreograph,

10:09.827 --> 10:11.728
but after the interview,
they'll want to fast track

10:11.729 --> 10:13.585
and roll it into the tourism
regulatory hearings

10:13.586 --> 10:15.660
- they're cooking up, so...
- Yup, buckle up, folks.

10:15.661 --> 10:18.284
We're going to get an invite
to the great national latrine.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.201
See who wants to take a public dump.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.831
Yeah, Mr. Fuck is going to Washington.

10:21.832 --> 10:25.869
No! I can't have this now!

10:30.410 --> 10:35.618
He's right. Who, um... Who
will they want to testify?

10:35.619 --> 10:38.743
Uh... Well, they'll... they'll want Dad.

10:38.744 --> 10:40.992
Okay, now... But we won't accept that.

10:40.993 --> 10:42.534
Protect the egg chamber!

10:42.535 --> 10:45.284
Karolina. Make some calls.

10:45.285 --> 10:48.910
Our various friends.
Uh... The Florida gang.

10:48.911 --> 10:51.201
See who can jam this the fuck up.

10:51.202 --> 10:52.992
Right.

10:52.993 --> 10:58.034
I mean, to actually get
to the bottom of this...

10:59.202 --> 11:01.704
...we could argue it would be better

11:01.705 --> 11:04.992
to have people who operationally...

11:04.993 --> 11:08.510
We suggest... Gerri and Tom?

11:09.435 --> 11:10.768
- What?
- Uh-huh.

11:10.769 --> 11:12.368
You want to explain your thinking, Hugo?

11:12.369 --> 11:14.803
Look, I... I'm just positing here, okay?

11:14.804 --> 11:17.576
Sure, yeah, but you're
positing in my direction, so...

11:17.577 --> 11:20.576
Yeah, it's just that General
Counsel is very compelling,

11:20.577 --> 11:22.701
and you know where the buck stops.

11:22.702 --> 11:24.242
Right. And why Tom?

11:24.243 --> 11:27.978
Tom can speak operationally.
And he got quite heavy play

11:27.979 --> 11:29.785
in that interview. Tom would be good.

11:29.786 --> 11:32.868
Well, I... I... I see where you're
coming from, Hugo, obviously,

11:32.869 --> 11:35.368
and I'd be happy to help.

11:35.369 --> 11:36.992
We might be able to slow it down

11:36.993 --> 11:38.743
but the Dems, they are gonna push fast,

11:38.744 --> 11:41.868
- and they're gonna push Logan.
- Do we just say "Fuck 'em"?

11:41.869 --> 11:44.284
Fuck... Congress, Roman?

11:44.285 --> 11:47.153
Yes, Shiv. Fuck Congress.
Have I shocked you?

11:47.154 --> 11:49.534
Uh... Shareholder meeting
in two-and-a-half weeks.

11:49.535 --> 11:52.826
I mean, we are unusually
subject to the vicissitudes

11:52.827 --> 11:54.008
of public opinion.

11:54.009 --> 11:58.142
Uh... I can translate. That's
Frank for "We're fucked."

12:07.702 --> 12:09.243
I want your help.

12:09.911 --> 12:10.941
Oh, yeah?

12:10.942 --> 12:13.284
Someone needs to run
to the store for smokes?

12:13.285 --> 12:18.661
This'll go on all night...
but it might not be okay.

12:19.619 --> 12:21.368
It might not be okay?

12:21.369 --> 12:24.201
Congress will spook shareholders.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.827
I'm on a knife's edge.

12:28.752 --> 12:34.786
Ten bad minutes on camera
in D.C., that could be it.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.951
The end.

12:37.952 --> 12:40.118
The end? Come on.

12:45.160 --> 12:50.326
I need you to chase down
the sovereign wealth money.

12:50.327 --> 12:54.202
Okay. Right. uh... I
mean, that's... It's, uh...

12:55.035 --> 12:56.326
It's a cool idea,

12:56.327 --> 12:58.868
but it's kind of a stretch, you know?

12:58.869 --> 13:01.159
That Central Asian money,

13:01.160 --> 13:05.576
that's no strings, fuckable dry powder.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.534
Time out from the responsibilities

13:08.535 --> 13:10.827
of being a public company.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.369
That's a fucking lifeline.
Can you do it?

13:16.535 --> 13:18.368
- Can I do it?
- Uh-huh.

13:18.369 --> 13:20.242
Um...

13:20.243 --> 13:23.868
Fuck. Dad, I... I want to say yes,

13:23.869 --> 13:27.326
but I'll be honest, if
it's, like, really important,

13:27.327 --> 13:29.534
I mean, I can say I can
do it, like, you know,

13:29.535 --> 13:31.701
a fireman in a movie,

13:31.702 --> 13:35.451
- but honestly, I...
- You act the fucknuckle,

13:35.452 --> 13:38.618
but you know, people like you.

13:38.619 --> 13:42.368
It's a really big
fucking deal to set up.

13:42.369 --> 13:44.326
Nah, anyone can do a deal.

13:44.327 --> 13:47.160
It's getting the right
number from the right suit.

13:48.243 --> 13:51.201
Getting your dick in there is easy.

13:51.202 --> 13:54.743
Getting them into bed, that's hard.

13:54.744 --> 13:55.786
For some.

13:56.702 --> 13:57.869
You can do it.

14:01.786 --> 14:03.535
Then, uh... yeah.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.118
Sure, Dad, I got it.

14:14.911 --> 14:16.826
- Keep me close.
- Okay.

14:16.827 --> 14:20.826
Take Laird and Karl... for the details.

14:20.827 --> 14:24.493
Great, I'm on it. Oh, um, also...

14:24.494 --> 14:28.159
just to... I don't know, check,

14:28.160 --> 14:32.534
uh, Marcia? Is she... upstairs, or...

14:32.535 --> 14:34.034
Is that okay? Are you okay?

14:34.035 --> 14:35.995
Do you have someone that
you can speak to about...

14:36.952 --> 14:38.076
shit?

14:38.077 --> 14:39.952
You want me to speak to a shrink?

14:41.285 --> 14:44.284
You know, you may want
to screw your mother,

14:44.285 --> 14:48.326
but I am okay in that
department, thank you.

14:48.327 --> 14:51.911
Great, well, it's just nice that
we can talk about these things.

14:52.494 --> 14:53.786
I'm gonna go.

14:57.952 --> 14:58.993
Mm-ah.

15:01.285 --> 15:02.409
- Oh.
- Hey.

15:02.410 --> 15:04.117
- Hello.
- Hey, you okay?

15:04.118 --> 15:06.504
Oh, yeah. Great, yeah.
Off to Asia to get ten billion.

15:06.505 --> 15:09.242
- Don't wait up, bye!
- Hey, how you doing?

15:09.243 --> 15:12.767
Yeah. Worried I've agreed to be CEO

15:12.768 --> 15:17.159
of a dumpster fire
pirate death ship. You?

15:17.160 --> 15:20.910
Yeah. Not worried. Sit. Sit.

15:20.911 --> 15:22.284
Right.

15:22.285 --> 15:25.661
The magazine was one
thing but, uh, this?

15:27.160 --> 15:29.534
I didn't know he was gonna pipe up.

15:29.535 --> 15:32.701
Yeah, I feel like I'm your prophylactic.

15:32.702 --> 15:35.451
A rubber you've slipped
on so I can protect you.

15:35.452 --> 15:36.992
Rhea, that was not the idea.

15:36.993 --> 15:39.534
I can see I fulfil a
useful role at this point:

15:39.535 --> 15:41.701
a more respectable flavor...

15:41.702 --> 15:44.076
secure votes from shaky shareholders.

15:44.077 --> 15:49.159
You're good. A new broom. You're golden.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.868
It's fun to be the new bride.

15:50.869 --> 15:53.242
Rearranging the bachelor's apartment.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.785
Putting flowers out.

15:54.786 --> 15:56.576
It's just not nice to
think you might find

15:56.577 --> 15:58.826
a corpse in the freezer,
you know, Bluebeard?

15:58.827 --> 16:02.117
Rhea, they kept this from me.

16:02.118 --> 16:04.992
- It's a rogue sicko. Trust me.
- Uh-huh.

16:04.993 --> 16:08.202
Yeah. Uh-huh. Well...

16:09.369 --> 16:10.785
By accident or design,

16:10.786 --> 16:14.368
you have left me very
little room to maneuver.

16:14.369 --> 16:16.534
Shall I... show my face?

16:16.535 --> 16:18.577
Oh, that would be very much appreciated.

16:20.452 --> 16:22.035
- Rhea.
- Shiv.

16:22.869 --> 16:24.284
Wow. Tough night.

16:24.285 --> 16:26.201
- Great to have you coming in.
- Well, thank you.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.702
Couldn't think of anyone
better to see us through.

16:31.035 --> 16:34.159
Hey! What you guys all doing here?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.618
Is there a game on?

16:35.619 --> 16:39.159
- Hey, Rhea.
- Seriously...

16:39.160 --> 16:41.326
that was a mountain out of a molehill.

16:41.327 --> 16:46.409
Everyone's saying it.
Hearings happen every day.

16:46.410 --> 16:51.242
C-SPAN filler. So, as I understand it,

16:51.243 --> 16:55.326
we have nothing to be guilty about...

16:55.327 --> 16:56.992
and nothing to worry about.

16:56.993 --> 17:02.077
So, yeah. I look forward to,
uh, getting more involved.

17:02.744 --> 17:03.869
Toodle-pip!

17:05.242 --> 17:07.409
- Thank you.
- They look scared.

17:07.410 --> 17:08.577
They're good.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.492
Rhea, I've got it.

17:17.493 --> 17:20.285
- It's nothing.
- Look after yourself, okay?

17:53.285 --> 17:56.576
It's good to see you, man.

17:56.577 --> 17:59.743
And you know how much I love the Hibs.

17:59.744 --> 18:01.451
- The fucking Hearts.
- Hearts.

18:01.452 --> 18:02.951
- Hearts.
- Yeah.

18:02.952 --> 18:04.992
But fuck it, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

18:04.993 --> 18:06.701
Okay.

18:06.702 --> 18:08.826
Think there's any chance you guys
have the muscle to take us private?

18:08.827 --> 18:11.493
Is that something that's
interesting to you and your dad?

18:11.494 --> 18:13.785
- Yes.
- Really?

18:13.786 --> 18:15.535
Well, that's...

18:17.227 --> 18:19.201
Yes, we're interested in
helping you go private.

18:19.202 --> 18:20.317
- Huh.
- Yeah.

18:20.318 --> 18:21.660
We like it as part of the portfolio,

18:21.661 --> 18:24.242
and we like the news
expertise you can share.

18:24.243 --> 18:25.618
- Great.
- Okay.

18:25.619 --> 18:27.242
Well, great.

18:27.243 --> 18:28.409
Uh... You want...

18:28.410 --> 18:30.659
Uh... Shall I call, uh,
Logan? Uh... Shall I get...

18:30.660 --> 18:32.159
Can you do it, Rome?

18:32.160 --> 18:33.701
Uh... Could you and your, uh...

18:33.702 --> 18:36.201
your bum-boys here come
to Turkey, like, tomorrow?

18:36.202 --> 18:38.401
- Okay...
- And pitch to me and my dad?

18:38.402 --> 18:41.117
Absolutely. I think we
can absolutely do that.

18:41.118 --> 18:43.743
- Ain't that right, bum-boys?
- Uh-huh.

18:43.744 --> 18:45.368
Azeri investment conference in Bursa.

18:45.369 --> 18:47.910
Everyone will be there,
we can get into it.

18:47.911 --> 18:50.076
Well, let's fucking get
into it. I can pitch.

18:50.077 --> 18:51.701
- I'll pitch the fuck out of it.
- Mm.

18:53.952 --> 18:57.576
Nice, Paddy! Nice!

18:57.577 --> 19:00.388
Good session, guys.
I've got the lads here.

19:01.485 --> 19:03.368
The owners are gonna want to
say a few words. All right?

19:03.369 --> 19:06.326
Great session, guys. And
listen, for Saturday...

19:06.327 --> 19:09.034
you have the ability,
you have the mentality.

19:09.035 --> 19:10.951
Watch that press
doesn't leave you exposed

19:10.952 --> 19:14.369
on the turnover, and you
fucking got this. Rome?

19:15.827 --> 19:18.701
Uh... Thank you. Yeah. Uh... Hey.

19:18.702 --> 19:21.201
Really proud to be
associated with you guys.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.868
Uh... Well, what the fuck can I tell you

19:22.869 --> 19:24.409
that you don't already know?

19:24.410 --> 19:26.618
You... You got all this,
guys. Don't worry about it.

19:26.619 --> 19:32.076
'Cause you guys are a team,
and, uh, when a team...

19:32.077 --> 19:35.576
is a team... it can't
actually physically be beaten.

19:35.577 --> 19:37.159
It's impossible.

19:37.160 --> 19:42.577
So, go hard, go fast,
go, you lovely bastards.

19:44.285 --> 19:46.242
- "Go, you lovely bastards"?
- I don't fucking know.

19:46.243 --> 19:47.576
What the fuck am I supposed to say?

19:47.577 --> 19:48.951
I have no idea.

20:12.494 --> 20:14.618
Do you want 20 of my best minutes

20:14.619 --> 20:17.368
on Turko-Azerbaijani relations?

20:17.369 --> 20:20.451
Uh... What, the oil
pipeline cooperation,

20:20.452 --> 20:22.794
the military and diplomatic links,

20:22.795 --> 20:24.320
or the deeper cultural sympathies?

20:24.321 --> 20:25.363
Ah.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.034
Hey, what's up?

20:31.035 --> 20:33.409
Hey, how's Dad? Is... Is he
okay? Is he... Is he doing it?

20:33.410 --> 20:36.785
Uh, yeah, we got them to agree
to Gerri and Tom up first,

20:36.786 --> 20:39.992
on operational, and then him with Ken.

20:39.993 --> 20:42.159
How's selling the family
cow for magic beans?

20:42.160 --> 20:46.279
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right,
yeah, just a dipshit, a sex pest

20:46.280 --> 20:50.242
and a Grand Old Duke of Dork
on a Central Asian vacation.

20:50.243 --> 20:52.660
No, nothin' to see here, thanks.

20:52.661 --> 20:55.076
Oh, fuck. Bill! What's Bill doing here?

20:55.077 --> 20:57.824
Oh, no! Gerri, if we're gonna kill Bill,

20:57.825 --> 20:59.242
I don't want to see Bill.

20:59.243 --> 21:02.409
Bill! Hey! Wow.

21:02.410 --> 21:03.826
- Hey!
- Hey!

21:03.827 --> 21:05.326
- Bill!
- Gerri!

21:05.327 --> 21:08.701
- Tom!
- Bill, Bill, Bill! Look at you!

21:08.702 --> 21:10.660
What the fuck? Are you appearing?

21:10.661 --> 21:12.076
- No! God, no.
- Okay.

21:12.077 --> 21:15.368
No, no. Hey, Magic
Johnson's still a Laker

21:15.369 --> 21:16.785
even if he's not on the team, right?

21:16.786 --> 21:18.326
Yeah, right, okay.

21:18.327 --> 21:20.409
Ah, I live in Maryland.
Just thought I'd come in,

21:20.410 --> 21:21.701
support the old gang.

21:21.702 --> 21:23.493
Well, that's such a nice gesture, Bill.

21:23.494 --> 21:24.785
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:24.786 --> 21:25.992
- Great to see you.
- Yeah.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.326
I'm rootin' for ya out there!

21:27.327 --> 21:29.701
Go get 'em, my friends.

21:29.702 --> 21:31.201
- Yeah.
- Tom.

21:31.202 --> 21:33.368
- Bill.
- Gerri. Thanks.

21:33.369 --> 21:35.284
- Good luck!
- Wow.

21:35.285 --> 21:36.701
- Wow.
- That's nice.

21:36.702 --> 21:40.702
- That is nice.
- I mean, that is just... nice.

21:44.702 --> 21:47.493
- Still.
- Adios, Bill.

21:47.494 --> 21:49.368
Yeah, rest in peace, Billy boy.

21:51.202 --> 21:55.034
Okay, folks. All right. Here we go.

21:55.035 --> 21:56.939
"Are you now, or have you ever been,

21:56.940 --> 22:00.493
a member of the Cruise Dirty
Sex Fuck Cover-up Party?"

22:00.494 --> 22:02.451
How's the link?

22:02.452 --> 22:04.242
We can hear you, Rhea, thank you.

22:04.243 --> 22:05.451
Great.

22:12.744 --> 22:15.076
- Good, good, good.
- Oh, my God.

22:15.077 --> 22:17.493
Hey, Gerri, do you wanna...
Can I do one more?

22:17.494 --> 22:20.117
Do you wanna do... one
more round? Just one?

22:20.118 --> 22:21.910
Tom, you've done the prep.

22:21.911 --> 22:24.277
You are murder-boarded to death, okay?

22:24.278 --> 22:26.493
- I know, I know. I know.
- Can you stop angsting? You're angsting me.

22:26.494 --> 22:28.242
- Okay. Okay.
- Just remember,

22:28.243 --> 22:29.910
it is not a courthouse.

22:29.911 --> 22:34.147
It is a stage. Okay?
Anything goes. Filibuster.

22:34.148 --> 22:37.117
Every minute you're speaking,
you're stealing from them

22:37.118 --> 22:38.785
and their horseshit.

22:38.786 --> 22:41.552
Eat, eat, eat those dangerous
fucking minutes. Okay?

22:41.553 --> 22:42.576
- Okay.
- Okay?

22:42.577 --> 22:43.785
- You bet. Okay.
- Got it.

22:43.786 --> 22:45.576
You guys got this. It's a cinch.

22:45.577 --> 22:46.785
- Okay?
- Yeah.

22:46.786 --> 22:48.326
Just let the training kick in.

22:48.327 --> 22:50.493
And maybe just try to enjoy it?

22:50.494 --> 22:52.660
Yeah. Thanks, Greg. Thanks.

22:52.661 --> 22:55.034
- Oh, we're on, guys. Let's go.
- All right,

22:55.035 --> 22:56.618
- here we go. Yes.
- This is it?

22:56.619 --> 22:58.785
- Right. Sure.
- It's time.

22:58.786 --> 23:00.451
- You're gonna do great.
- Okay. Okay.

23:00.452 --> 23:01.624
- Ready?
- Okay. Come here.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.326
- Good luck, everybody.
- You're good.

23:03.327 --> 23:04.826
- I know. Good, yeah?
- Let's go.

23:04.827 --> 23:06.076
- Let's do this.
- All right.

23:06.077 --> 23:07.326
Go team.

23:44.452 --> 23:47.231
The Committee on Commerce,
Science and Transportation

23:47.232 --> 23:48.326
will come to order.

23:48.327 --> 23:49.992
We welcome everyone to today's hearing

23:49.993 --> 23:53.409
on corporate abuses in the
Brightstar cruise lines.

23:53.410 --> 23:56.493
Just look at the cash flow.
We are undervalued.

23:56.494 --> 23:58.576
I think tech just had
everybody shitting their pants

23:58.577 --> 24:01.826
about legacy media, but
really, the wheel turns.

24:01.827 --> 24:03.408
And most tech is overvalued.

24:03.409 --> 24:05.618
We're profitable. We're real money.

24:05.619 --> 24:06.992
This is a tremendous opportunity.

24:06.993 --> 24:08.493
This is once-in-a-lifetime.

24:08.494 --> 24:10.826
You get to buy into
the U.S. media landscape

24:10.827 --> 24:13.494
at the very top. The very top.

24:21.869 --> 24:24.368
Well, it's a lot of debt, right?

24:24.369 --> 24:26.117
Are you sure you can bring it together?

24:26.118 --> 24:29.743
Absolutely sure.

24:29.744 --> 24:32.765
Jaime here is the fucking
master of leverage.

24:32.766 --> 24:35.117
He has structured some of
the biggest LBOs in history.

24:35.118 --> 24:36.701
- Right?
- Guilty as charged.

24:38.786 --> 24:40.868
Yeah, besides, we'd, um,

24:40.869 --> 24:43.743
have a decent amount of equity in this

24:43.744 --> 24:46.910
and not something of any...

24:46.911 --> 24:51.410
... concern. Hello?
Um... Are they with you?

24:53.202 --> 24:54.327
We...

24:57.077 --> 25:00.201
The, uh, the guy in the black
vest has a gun just here.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.618
Dave? We're good, right?

25:05.619 --> 25:07.576
- It's good?
- Yeah. Hey, look, we're good, we're good.

25:07.577 --> 25:08.700
- Okay.
- But, uh...

25:08.701 --> 25:10.743
we're all gonna go with
these gentlemen now, okay?

25:10.744 --> 25:12.451
We're all gonna... go?

25:12.452 --> 25:14.201
- Uh...
- Yes.

25:14.202 --> 25:17.076
Uh... No. I don't think... Is this...

25:17.077 --> 25:18.743
These gentlemen are... are who, exactly?

25:18.744 --> 25:20.660
- We'll go with them, it's fine.
- Dave?

25:20.661 --> 25:24.744
Okay, uh... Dave? Uh...
Dave... just walked out.

25:26.369 --> 25:28.660
- Dave just walked out.
- Yes. We'll go with them now.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.910
Okay. Can I just ask what
this is in regards to?

25:30.911 --> 25:33.201
Is this about the meeting? Is
it... It's a business thing?

25:33.202 --> 25:35.368
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, and my security guy,

25:35.369 --> 25:37.451
Dave, he just walked out.
Can I ask where Dave went?

25:37.452 --> 25:38.743
Dave... Dave's not coming.

25:38.744 --> 25:40.660
- Oh, Dave's not coming.
- Yeah. Uh...

25:40.661 --> 25:44.008
Um... I... I... I would actually
really like for Dave to come.

25:44.009 --> 25:45.743
Dave's downstairs, we'll go without him.

25:45.744 --> 25:46.992
- Please, gentlemen...
- Uh... Dave!

25:46.993 --> 25:50.109
Uh... There's a concern about Dave.

25:50.110 --> 25:53.489
It's a security risk here, so
we're better with these guys.

25:53.490 --> 25:57.368
Okay? It's, uh, all good.
Everything is under control.

25:57.369 --> 25:58.660
There could be a situation,

25:58.661 --> 26:00.743
but luckily, we're being looked after.

26:00.744 --> 26:02.515
Oh, we're being looked
after. That's nice.

26:02.516 --> 26:04.534
Laird, let's get... let's get Dave.

26:06.193 --> 26:08.618
- Uh... We need to go.
- Yeah. Oh... Oh!

26:08.619 --> 26:10.409
- Protocol, he took my phone.
- Hey!

26:10.410 --> 26:12.508
- And I can't contact my security.
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.

26:12.509 --> 26:14.117
It's... It's fine. Don't worry about it.

26:14.118 --> 26:18.618
Senator Eavis, you have
five minutes for questions.

26:18.619 --> 26:23.159
Mr. Wambsgans, I hope
I'm saying that correctly.

26:23.160 --> 26:26.992
Just some background.
Mr. Lester McClintock.

26:26.993 --> 26:28.868
You accept he offered jobs

26:28.869 --> 26:31.743
to young women who would sleep with him?

26:31.744 --> 26:34.159
Uh... That does seem to be the case.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.368
Um... But the... the company,
uh, wasn't aware,

26:37.369 --> 26:41.326
and obviously, that was some
time before my time, um...

26:41.327 --> 26:43.826
However, Bill... uh, Lockheart,

26:43.827 --> 26:45.534
- my predecessor...
- Uh-huh.

26:45.535 --> 26:48.785
But within the upper echelons
of the firm and the family,

26:48.786 --> 26:54.660
Lester was commonly known
as Mo. Is that correct?

26:54.661 --> 26:59.201
I... I don't... I don't...
I... I'm a relative newcomer.

26:59.202 --> 27:04.535
This email, you call
Lester McClintock "Mo." Why?

27:06.410 --> 27:09.201
I... I guess I think
it was just a nickname.

27:09.202 --> 27:14.056
Mm-hm. You call him
"Mo" over 30 times in emails

27:14.057 --> 27:17.159
to family and colleagues,
but you never use it

27:17.160 --> 27:21.031
in the items of correspondence
sent to him privately,

27:21.032 --> 27:24.035
for instance, during
his illness. Why not?

27:28.869 --> 27:31.368
- Senator, I don't know.
- You don't know?

27:31.369 --> 27:34.660
He was called Mo, but
always behind his back.

27:34.661 --> 27:39.076
Um... Uh... I'd... I'd
have to look at the emails,

27:39.077 --> 27:40.534
uh, I never thought about it.

27:40.535 --> 27:46.034
Lester's nickname was
Mo. Mo Lester. Molester.

27:46.035 --> 27:47.452
That never came up?

27:50.952 --> 27:54.326
Senator, I think, uh...

27:54.327 --> 27:58.992
I guess maybe he was, uh, a
little creepy-seeming perhaps.

27:58.993 --> 28:00.660
Well, you were right there.

28:00.661 --> 28:04.368
But just because we... he
was called, um, Mo Lester,

28:04.369 --> 28:05.910
doesn't... didn't mean...

28:05.911 --> 28:08.451
It was just a...
It's just an off-color joke.

28:08.452 --> 28:09.576
You know?

28:09.577 --> 28:11.785
That was 100 percent based on truth.

28:11.786 --> 28:15.910
But of all the many, many people
who called this molester...

28:15.911 --> 28:20.868
"Mo Lester", not one of
them had the slightest idea

28:20.869 --> 28:23.076
that he actually was a molester.

28:23.077 --> 28:26.076
I mean, you could see how
that stretches our credulity.

28:26.077 --> 28:27.576
Yes, senator, I can see that.

28:27.577 --> 28:33.409
I think he just seemed
a bit like one, maybe.

28:33.410 --> 28:34.785
But we didn't know anything.

28:34.786 --> 28:36.534
Well, if he seemed a
little bit like one,

28:36.535 --> 28:38.382
don't you think it behooved
the people in charge

28:38.383 --> 28:40.534
- to find out if he was one...
- Oh, my...

28:40.535 --> 28:43.159
... before you sent him out
on ships full of young women

28:43.160 --> 28:46.493
and vulnerable old and young guests?

28:46.494 --> 28:49.242
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

28:49.243 --> 28:50.743
This isn't business, is it?

28:50.744 --> 28:52.618
No, it is not very businessy.

28:52.619 --> 28:54.117
Oh, shit!

28:54.118 --> 28:56.451
- Hey.
- Don't worry, this is all normal.

28:56.452 --> 28:59.951
Yeah, great, 'cause this feels
super fucking normal, man.

28:59.952 --> 29:02.159
Is this... Are these terrorists?

29:02.160 --> 29:04.785
And where's my fucking
security guy? Where's Dave?

29:04.786 --> 29:06.992
It... It's just an...

29:06.993 --> 29:08.785
an administrative action function.

29:08.786 --> 29:10.868
Yeah, good, great. And what exactly...

29:10.869 --> 29:11.944
Hey, look at that.

29:11.945 --> 29:14.451
Guy not being allowed to
leave the hotel at gunpoint.

29:14.452 --> 29:15.900
- That's...
- Oh, Christ.

29:15.901 --> 29:17.618
- ... an administrative action function.
- Yeah.

29:17.619 --> 29:19.409
This is gr... What...
What... What is that?

29:19.410 --> 29:22.420
There's just like, uh...
um... a gathering here now,

29:22.421 --> 29:25.493
of us and some... some other
investors and so on, and...

29:25.494 --> 29:27.326
- And men with guns, yeah?
- Yep, yep.

29:27.327 --> 29:29.826
Their guys are some kind of, um...

29:29.827 --> 29:33.534
anti-corruption kind of guys,
and they're like...

29:33.535 --> 29:35.660
- It's like their conference...
- Really?

29:35.661 --> 29:37.284
... or, uh, party, and...

29:37.285 --> 29:38.574
we're all invited.

29:38.575 --> 29:42.374
Okay, well, that's nice, uh...
but what if we, you know,

29:42.375 --> 29:44.992
what if we... if we don't
wanna go, is that cool?

29:46.661 --> 29:48.201
Okay.

29:48.202 --> 29:51.576
It's... It's the kind of party
where you have to go.

29:51.577 --> 29:53.910
- Oh. I see.
- It would be... rude.

29:53.911 --> 29:55.371
Okay. Well, I mean, I guess

29:55.372 --> 29:57.131
- I don't mind being, like...
- Ah.

29:57.132 --> 29:58.910
... a little, tiny bit rude.

29:58.911 --> 30:00.534
Let me direct your attention

30:00.535 --> 30:03.369
to document 16 of the
blue-tabbed packet.

30:04.285 --> 30:08.242
Document 16... of the blue?

30:08.243 --> 30:10.326
- It suggests that there were over...
- Document 16.

30:10.327 --> 30:13.509
... forty thousand electronic records

30:13.510 --> 30:15.660
and paper documents from the period

30:15.661 --> 30:19.701
which we're interested in,
that were not available to us.

30:19.702 --> 30:20.743
Uh... Yes,

30:20.744 --> 30:22.785
unfortunately, it seems
that there are a great many

30:22.786 --> 30:24.284
of these documents that were destroyed

30:24.285 --> 30:27.037
in the, uh, course of
normal data management

30:27.038 --> 30:28.243
and corporate housekeeping.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.992
So, there was not a targeted cover-up?

30:31.993 --> 30:33.992
The hard drives that were wiped?

30:33.993 --> 30:36.576
Uh... It's a normal practice,
as I understand it.

30:36.577 --> 30:38.576
Um... I'm not an IT expert.

30:38.577 --> 30:43.493
But on Thanksgiving last year,
it seems that a number of boxes

30:43.494 --> 30:45.744
were targeted specifically.

30:47.394 --> 30:48.843
I'm not aware of that.

30:48.844 --> 30:51.034
Well, if you'll look at item 34,

30:51.035 --> 30:57.077
it suggests boxes 2918 to boxes 3125...

30:58.369 --> 30:59.660
are now empty.

30:59.661 --> 31:01.992
Uh... They were full back in August,

31:01.993 --> 31:05.326
but when they were subpoenaed,
they were apparently unavailable

31:05.327 --> 31:07.785
and in the interim, they were signed out

31:07.786 --> 31:11.242
and if you look at
the ledger, packet 15B,

31:11.243 --> 31:14.117
by a Gregory Hirsch.

31:14.118 --> 31:16.786
Is that someone known
to you, Mr. Wambsgans?

31:17.786 --> 31:19.201
Uh... No, no, sorry.

31:19.202 --> 31:21.619
- "No"?
- "No"? "No", Tom?

31:22.702 --> 31:24.242
Hm?

31:24.243 --> 31:28.785
Oh, yes, yes, sorry. Yes.
Known... Known... Known to me.

31:28.786 --> 31:31.785
- Yes. In that sense, yes.
- In what sense?

31:31.786 --> 31:33.952
Uh... In the sense that, uh...

31:35.285 --> 31:38.242
that, uh... what I understood
that you meant...

31:38.243 --> 31:39.660
What did you think I meant?

31:39.661 --> 31:42.451
That... Um... I knew of him,

31:42.452 --> 31:45.284
but no, no, I know...
I know him. And his face.

31:45.285 --> 31:47.720
Mm-hm. Do you know what is special

31:47.721 --> 31:50.992
about the hours between
3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.

31:50.993 --> 31:54.660
- on the night of March 12th?
- Uh... No, sir.

31:54.661 --> 31:58.275
That was the only two-hour
period in which you did not send

31:58.276 --> 32:01.701
an email to Mr. Hirsch with the title...

32:01.702 --> 32:06.117
"You Can't Make a Tomlette
Without Breaking Some Greggs."

32:06.118 --> 32:09.827
You sent the same email to
him 67 times in one evening.

32:13.035 --> 32:14.868
I guess it was a joke.

32:14.869 --> 32:20.242
Right. I wonder, do the
phrases "human furniture"

32:20.243 --> 32:23.118
or "footstooling" mean anything to you?

32:24.077 --> 32:26.159
Not that I'm conscious of, no.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.839
Have you ever used another human being

32:27.840 --> 32:29.993
as a footstool, Mr. Wambsgans?

32:31.327 --> 32:34.660
Uh... I... Senator,
I use a variety of, um,

32:34.661 --> 32:40.076
target-oriented, um, incentives
to enhance optimal performance.

32:42.702 --> 32:44.868
I yield back the balance of my time.

32:44.869 --> 32:48.368
What is it like to be married
to a man with two assholes?

32:48.369 --> 32:50.660
... reconvene shortly.

32:50.661 --> 32:52.326
If I was to give Tom a letter grade,

32:52.327 --> 32:54.869
I'd give him a B-plus
for "bad plus terrible".

32:59.619 --> 33:01.242
That was all... That was all fucking me.

33:01.243 --> 33:03.368
They hit me from every fucking side!

33:03.369 --> 33:04.868
It's okay. Tom, you did good.

33:04.869 --> 33:07.284
Oh, I didn't get enough
resources spent on me.

33:07.285 --> 33:08.743
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

33:08.744 --> 33:11.826
I'm getting... I was
fucked from every direction!

33:11.827 --> 33:13.701
- Are you fucking me, Shiv?
- Tom!

33:13.702 --> 33:15.785
- Huh? I'm the patsy, I'm the meat in the sandwich.
- Sit down.

33:15.786 --> 33:18.576
Gerri is the bulletproof monk.
Kendall and Logan in reserve.

33:18.577 --> 33:20.076
I'm the meat in the fucking sandwich.

33:20.077 --> 33:21.451
Hey, calm down.

33:21.452 --> 33:25.534
Oh, fuck. Fuck. Oh,
fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

33:25.535 --> 33:26.641
- Okay.
- Oh, Fuck.

33:26.642 --> 33:29.242
Guys, everything is fine.
Nothing bad is happening here.

33:29.243 --> 33:32.326
Oh, man. Oh, my God. Ah.

33:32.327 --> 33:34.735
Fuck, man, I just turned
down a quarter of a billion,

33:34.736 --> 33:37.618
and now I'm going to jail forever,
'cause of this fucking guy, man!

33:37.619 --> 33:39.117
This fucking...

33:39.118 --> 33:41.034
You. Outside.

33:41.035 --> 33:44.035
- He...
- Out-fucking-side, now!

33:46.577 --> 33:47.702
Unbelievable.

33:54.243 --> 33:56.743
Shiv, is there any way we can find out

33:56.744 --> 33:58.284
what's coming down the pipe at us?

33:58.285 --> 34:01.284
Because much more of that,
and we're fucking toast.

34:01.285 --> 34:03.534
All of a sudden, Sandy and Stewy are...

34:03.535 --> 34:05.785
looking pretty good to the shareholders.

34:05.786 --> 34:10.527
He's right. Maybe it's time
to drop some of our research.

34:12.118 --> 34:13.327
I'll see what I can do.

34:17.034 --> 34:19.077
Jess, will you keep an eye on...

34:21.952 --> 34:25.327
- You?
- Okay. Sorry.

34:27.284 --> 34:31.409
What a shit show. What
a fucking shit show.

34:48.077 --> 34:51.868
So... Yeah. Just wondered
if I could say hi.

34:51.869 --> 34:53.242
Anyone see you come in?

34:53.243 --> 34:55.020
You're pretty regular on ATN these days,

34:55.021 --> 34:56.460
I notice. How are you liking that?

34:56.460 --> 34:59.159
It's got its advantages,
its disadvantages.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.076
- Uh-huh.
- They love the ratings.

35:01.077 --> 35:02.951
Yeah, right.

35:02.952 --> 35:06.242
So, I feel like after
everything we did together,

35:06.243 --> 35:07.910
there's some residual good will?

35:07.911 --> 35:10.868
Okay, look, meeting over.

35:10.869 --> 35:14.576
We're not gonna soft-peddle,
Shiv. Great to see you.

35:14.577 --> 35:16.118
I'm not asking, I'm giving.

35:17.452 --> 35:19.201
- What?
- Just a favor.

35:19.202 --> 35:21.034
We've been digging,
and I'd like to help.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.910
I still think that Gil
is a great candidate,

35:22.911 --> 35:25.201
and I would hate for you
to make fools of yourselves.

35:25.202 --> 35:27.743
Says the person whose
husband was just called,

35:27.744 --> 35:30.201
"A smirking block of domestic feta",

35:30.202 --> 35:32.409
- by the Atlantic.
- Weissel, the weasel.

35:32.410 --> 35:33.506
You want the dirt?

35:33.507 --> 35:37.826
No, Shiv, we don't need your
shit-talking background briefing

35:37.827 --> 35:39.284
but thank you.

35:39.285 --> 35:42.201
He's dodgy as fuck.

35:42.202 --> 35:45.534
Lost joint custody of his kids,
substance abuse issues,

35:45.535 --> 35:47.201
done for soliciting prostitutes.

35:47.202 --> 35:48.576
He's not exactly your Snow White,

35:48.577 --> 35:51.159
- he's your Blow White.
- Uh-huh. Not interested.

35:51.160 --> 35:52.660
This meeting never happened.

35:52.661 --> 35:56.326
Okay. On Mo and James
Weissel, you can go to town.

35:56.327 --> 35:57.910
And if you're looking for a scalp,

35:57.911 --> 35:59.127
we're willing to give up Bill.

35:59.128 --> 36:03.117
So, if you want the easy win,
go for Bill, and we'll fold.

36:03.118 --> 36:06.927
Okay? And then we can keep
the invites to ATN flowing

36:06.928 --> 36:10.368
and the snipers trained
on your primary rivals.

36:10.369 --> 36:14.451
I'm sorry. Tell your
dad it's not personal.

36:14.452 --> 36:17.951
We've just got something
really, really good now...

36:17.952 --> 36:20.159
much better than Weissel.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.577
Bullshit. How much better?

36:23.786 --> 36:26.376
I'll give you a clue. It actually rhymes

36:26.377 --> 36:28.896
very precisely with "You're fucked".

36:30.744 --> 36:33.076
- What is it? Let's go through it again.
- No direct knowledge.

36:33.077 --> 36:35.025
- No direct knowledge.
- Full cooperation.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.868
Okay, hey. Hey. Guys, listen up.

36:36.869 --> 36:39.034
Hey. We have a problem.

36:39.035 --> 36:40.910
They have someone else
for later in the week

36:40.911 --> 36:42.576
who could probably kill us.

36:42.577 --> 36:43.910
- Who?
- Wait a minute.

36:43.911 --> 36:45.910
A victim. Used to work under Lester,

36:45.911 --> 36:48.159
ex-entertainment manager, Kira someone?

36:48.160 --> 36:51.409
Also knows a bunch of victims
personally, and details.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.368
Feels personally responsible.
They're prepping her.

36:54.369 --> 36:55.785
- Oh, fuck! Fuck!
- Yeah.

36:55.786 --> 36:58.576
If she comes out, and the NDAs domino,

36:58.577 --> 37:01.034
I don't think... I think that's it.

37:01.035 --> 37:03.661
Hey, just wanted to say, "Good luck".

37:04.661 --> 37:06.284
Uh... We got an incoming bogey.

37:06.285 --> 37:09.201
- Where is she now?
- I... I... That's all I know.

37:09.202 --> 37:12.493
Oh, uh, they got her
through Senator Gilliard,

37:12.494 --> 37:15.327
- who you know, right, Rhea?
- A little.

37:16.891 --> 37:18.099
But what is this?

37:19.452 --> 37:23.618
This, uh... This supposed victim.

37:23.619 --> 37:26.660
Do you think... Is it
possible? Could we see...

37:26.661 --> 37:28.701
You know, could we meet
up with her, you know?

37:28.702 --> 37:31.701
Talk? You know, find out what she wants?

37:31.702 --> 37:33.494
- Apologize?
- What?

37:34.619 --> 37:35.661
Oh, come on.

37:36.619 --> 37:38.159
We... We... We gotta try.

37:38.160 --> 37:41.284
Whether it's true or not,
it... it changes the narrative.

37:41.285 --> 37:45.535
One of you. Both of you. Please.

37:49.817 --> 37:52.159
Guys, it's almost time.
They're heading back in.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.743
So, we gotta get this show on the road.

37:54.744 --> 37:57.284
One last time, just in
case they're super-direct,

37:57.285 --> 38:00.493
did you, Logan Roy, witness any assaults

38:00.494 --> 38:02.242
on your ships or take part in them?

38:02.243 --> 38:04.410
I'm not gonna answer a
fucking question like that.

38:04.411 --> 38:06.242
- I, uh, I thought that's just a "No".
- Yeah.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.785
I'm not dignifying that
fucking question with an answer.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.035
You can both fuck off.

38:11.035 --> 38:13.326
- Okay.
- Is he okay?

38:13.327 --> 38:14.576
Low blood sugar.

38:14.577 --> 38:16.785
Could you, uh, give him
a chocolate suppository?

38:16.786 --> 38:19.159
Just, uh, slip a Snickers bar up there?

38:41.410 --> 38:43.201
- Don Grundham.
- Oh.

38:43.202 --> 38:44.910
Institute for a Competitive America.

38:44.911 --> 38:47.026
- Oh, hello.
- Keep fighting the good fight.

38:47.027 --> 38:49.534
You got a lot of Con-heads
out here pullin' for ya.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.076
- Con-heads?
- Yes.

38:51.077 --> 38:52.910
That's fantastic. May I use that?

38:52.911 --> 38:54.660
- Sure.
- All right, God bless you, sir.

38:54.661 --> 38:55.719
Thank you.

38:55.720 --> 38:56.845
"Con-heads"...

38:59.243 --> 39:06.326
I spy with my little eye
something that begins with H.

39:06.327 --> 39:08.505
- Hostages.
- You are smart,

39:08.506 --> 39:11.493
aren't you? Well, that
game didn't take us too far.

39:11.494 --> 39:15.618
That was like 30 seconds.
Marry, fuck, kill?

39:15.619 --> 39:20.660
Marry, fuck, kill...
the executive floor.

39:20.661 --> 39:22.660
- Executive floor.
- Mm-hm.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.242
- Hmm.
- Uh... I'd kill Ray.

39:25.243 --> 39:27.409
- Of course.
- Fuck Elsa.

39:27.410 --> 39:28.785
- Hmm.
- Marry Gerri.

39:28.786 --> 39:30.242
- Gerri?
- Yeah.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.368
- Marry Gerri?
- Well, it's a small pool.

39:32.369 --> 39:33.785
You'd marry Gerri?

39:33.786 --> 39:35.701
- You sick fuck. Gerri?
- Yeah.

39:35.702 --> 39:37.618
You like Gerri?

39:37.619 --> 39:40.284
Oh, that's hilarious.
You're fucking disgusting.

39:40.285 --> 39:41.743
Gerri?

39:41.744 --> 39:46.409
Ugh! Hot. Ugh! Karl, what about you?

39:46.410 --> 39:48.785
- Look, full disclosure?
- Yeah?

39:48.786 --> 39:53.117
I am, um, currently
having a panic attack.

39:53.118 --> 39:54.910
Could I sit there? Do you mind, Laird?

39:54.911 --> 39:56.409
- Oh, sure.
- Really?

39:56.410 --> 39:58.743
- Mm-hm. God...
- You seem... kind of the same.

40:00.118 --> 40:02.785
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.

40:02.786 --> 40:06.201
- Up you go. On the floor.
- Oh. Okay. Oh, Jesus.

40:06.202 --> 40:07.951
Guys?

40:07.952 --> 40:09.576
Where do you think they're taking them?

40:09.577 --> 40:10.826
It doesn't look like they're going

40:10.827 --> 40:12.701
- for a tour of the spa.
- Oh, fuck!

40:12.702 --> 40:14.242
Let me tell you... tell you something.

40:14.243 --> 40:15.660
- My advice...
- Yeah?

40:15.661 --> 40:18.326
.... just don't look at anything.

40:18.327 --> 40:21.534
'Cause if you don't look,
then you're not a witness.

40:21.535 --> 40:23.201
And if you're not a witness,

40:23.202 --> 40:24.826
- you know.
- Yeah. Just take it easy, man.

40:24.827 --> 40:26.667
Just take it easy. You
don't have... It's okay.

40:27.952 --> 40:29.034
God.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.409
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

40:30.410 --> 40:31.534
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:31.535 --> 40:32.743
How we, uh...

40:32.744 --> 40:34.992
- How we doin'?
- Good. Good, man.

40:34.993 --> 40:36.493
- Good.
- All good.

40:36.494 --> 40:40.243
So, uh, my president's daughter's
husband has asked him

40:40.244 --> 40:42.701
to take closer control
of some key assets.

40:42.702 --> 40:46.159
It's anti-corruption,
but a bit of a power grab.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.493
Some Turkish acquiescence,
but it's all in play.

40:49.494 --> 40:54.618
And can I ask, not to
make this all about us,

40:54.619 --> 40:57.992
but are they going to
shoot us at any point?

40:57.993 --> 41:00.493
I'm also intrigued on that point.

41:00.494 --> 41:02.034
No one is getting shot.

41:02.035 --> 41:06.201
Look, it's complicated,
but with Zeynal here...

41:06.202 --> 41:08.702
- Uh-huh.
- ... there is some interest in the deal.

41:10.494 --> 41:15.326
The deal. Um... Okay,
the deal. Yeah. Great.

41:15.327 --> 41:19.618
So, one query they
wanted some clarity on was

41:19.619 --> 41:22.534
how could we... how could
they be sure their investment

41:22.535 --> 41:24.368
wouldn't be blocked by your government?

41:24.369 --> 41:30.284
Well, okay, uh, it wouldn't.
My father has a lot of sway.

41:30.285 --> 41:33.951
I mean, he can't lock his
opponents up in a hotel,

41:33.952 --> 41:36.284
uh, but, well, he kinda could.

41:36.285 --> 41:38.242
Okay, and, uh... you're the target

41:38.243 --> 41:40.159
- of another bid?
- Yes.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.701
Isn't that a problem?

41:41.702 --> 41:44.440
That is not a problem at
all. If the price is right,

41:44.441 --> 41:46.951
we are fully confident that
we can reach a settlement

41:46.952 --> 41:48.410
before the shareholder meeting.

41:51.118 --> 41:56.326
Okay. Okay, well, that went great.

41:56.327 --> 41:58.826
- Yeah. That's... great.
- Really hope so.

41:58.827 --> 42:01.409
Yeah. I mean, should we see

42:01.410 --> 42:04.201
if any of the other hostages
want to cut a deal?

42:04.202 --> 42:05.743
This could be a bumper time for us.

42:21.535 --> 42:23.868
Well, this doesn't feel great.

42:23.869 --> 42:28.577
No. No, soft skills,
lady-duty shit-work.

42:30.577 --> 42:32.911
Not great at all.

42:34.577 --> 42:38.493
Senators, when I read
of the abuses of power

42:38.494 --> 42:40.619
alleged in my cruise division...

42:42.327 --> 42:47.117
well... that was the
worst day of my life.

42:47.118 --> 42:49.534
To think bad things might have gone on

42:49.535 --> 42:50.952
without my knowledge.

42:52.786 --> 42:54.826
And frankly...

42:54.827 --> 42:58.868
I don't know if I'll
ever forgive myself.

42:58.869 --> 43:03.562
But we will investigate,
and we will make sure

43:03.563 --> 43:08.826
every victim is compensated,
and every act of wrongdoing...

43:08.827 --> 43:12.660
punished to the full extent of the law.

43:12.661 --> 43:17.035
I just hope, so help me God,
you believe me when I say that.

43:17.869 --> 43:19.160
Thank you very much.

43:19.703 --> 43:20.785
Fuck, yeah.

43:20.786 --> 43:23.201
Senator Eavis? Time is yours.

43:23.202 --> 43:24.992
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

43:24.993 --> 43:30.618
Emerson said, "Every institution
is the shadow of a single man."

43:30.619 --> 43:33.979
At Waystar, that man
is Logan Roy, isn't he?

43:34.827 --> 43:36.368
Well, I'm...

43:36.369 --> 43:39.284
I'm certainly not gonna
argue with Mr. Emerson.

43:40.827 --> 43:44.494
Your cruises run for profit,
your news runs for profit.

43:46.094 --> 43:48.201
Is that any way to keep the life blood

43:48.202 --> 43:49.785
of a democracy going,

43:49.786 --> 43:54.534
by using news as your own personal ATM?

43:54.535 --> 43:56.201
Uh... If... If I may.

43:56.202 --> 44:00.451
Um... I think you might be
under a misapprehension, Senator.

44:00.452 --> 44:02.860
In this country, all news,

44:02.861 --> 44:05.992
from the Times to
the supermarket tabloid,

44:05.993 --> 44:07.625
is for profit, sir.

44:07.626 --> 44:10.100
We don't have a state media.
As I'm sure you know,

44:10.101 --> 44:12.201
you'd have to go to
China or Russia for that.

44:12.202 --> 44:15.660
- Ooh, snap! Snap on Gil!
- We don't have a state media yet...

44:15.661 --> 44:17.576
Have we got that, Karolina?

44:17.577 --> 44:19.635
Let's get the surrogates
prepped with that line.

44:19.636 --> 44:24.743
They call Gil "Meth-Head Santa"
because he so rarely delivers.

44:24.744 --> 44:27.493
What I'm getting at, is it any surprise

44:27.494 --> 44:31.576
that, uh, exploitation
and cover-up runs rife

44:31.577 --> 44:33.951
at your cruise division?

44:33.952 --> 44:36.405
I mean, exploitation is at

44:36.406 --> 44:39.284
the heart of your business model.

44:39.285 --> 44:43.744
Well, I... I would, of
course, disagree, but, uh...

44:45.452 --> 44:49.577
but in terms of the historic...

44:51.243 --> 44:52.910
historical...

44:52.911 --> 44:59.576
historic charges of
practice... malpractice, um...

44:59.577 --> 45:03.576
Mr. Logan Roy, what
did you personally know

45:03.577 --> 45:06.868
about the operation of
a system of obfuscation

45:06.869 --> 45:09.785
of wrongdoing in your cruise division...

45:09.786 --> 45:12.285
by the means of the
keeping of shadow logs?

45:14.369 --> 45:17.660
At that point, I believe
my son was across

45:17.661 --> 45:20.951
- that operation, right?
- At which point?

45:20.952 --> 45:24.951
At the point he was across
entertainment operations.

45:24.952 --> 45:26.410
You can talk to him.

45:29.202 --> 45:30.951
Mr. Kendall Roy, then.

45:30.952 --> 45:33.117
- Tell us about the shadow logs.
- Okay, you know what,

45:33.118 --> 45:36.168
I'm sorry, Madam Chairwoman,
can... can I speak for a moment?

45:36.169 --> 45:38.468
Because you know, I... I'm
here in good faith today,

45:38.469 --> 45:41.576
I'm very willing to talk you,
Senator, and this committee

45:41.577 --> 45:45.209
through our operations,
but, uh, let's cut the BS,

45:45.210 --> 45:50.076
shall we? Because it seems
to me that this investigation,

45:50.077 --> 45:51.826
uh, is not about proper oversight

45:51.827 --> 45:55.076
of the cruise industry
codes and standards,

45:55.077 --> 45:58.159
or some highly regrettable
but isolated incidents

45:58.160 --> 45:59.618
from nearly two decades ago.

45:59.619 --> 46:01.493
What this feels to me it's about

46:01.494 --> 46:04.701
is your personal dislike of my father,

46:04.702 --> 46:09.368
and your ideological
hatred of his newspapers

46:09.369 --> 46:12.117
and his news channels,
and in particular,

46:12.118 --> 46:16.618
of the, uh, success story which is ATN,

46:16.619 --> 46:18.826
on which you've appeared,
I think, 14 times

46:18.827 --> 46:20.785
in the last four months, Senator.

46:20.786 --> 46:21.951
Good, good, good.

46:21.952 --> 46:23.409
Senator Eavis, it seems to me

46:23.410 --> 46:26.372
that since you don't agree
with us ideologically,

46:26.373 --> 46:28.660
that nothing we can say will be enough,

46:28.661 --> 46:30.743
no groveling will be low enough,

46:30.744 --> 46:33.910
and as much as you like
to accuse us of bias,

46:33.911 --> 46:36.076
uh, today, you're the one with the bias.

46:36.077 --> 46:39.660
So, I say go ahead. Hit
us as hard as you can.

46:39.661 --> 46:42.202
We can take it. We have nothing to hide.

46:46.535 --> 46:48.202
So, she's expecting us, yeah?

46:50.202 --> 46:52.826
Look, I'm not going in.

46:52.827 --> 46:57.910
Seriously? You're...
You're leaving it to me?

46:57.911 --> 47:01.493
Siobhan, you don't have to do this.

47:01.494 --> 47:03.702
If she speaks and she's compelling...

47:05.285 --> 47:07.494
then that's it for my family's company.

47:09.229 --> 47:13.313
So... yeah. I do have to.

47:19.369 --> 47:20.410
Thanks, Rhea.

47:25.744 --> 47:29.168
Thank you so much for your time.

47:29.169 --> 47:31.150
Ah, Mr. Roberts. We can
now slip into something

47:31.151 --> 47:32.992
a little bit more comfortable.

47:32.993 --> 47:34.743
- A warm bath.
- I already feel better.

47:34.744 --> 47:39.702
And I want to say right off,
for the record, gentlemen...

47:41.410 --> 47:42.535
I like you.

47:43.911 --> 47:46.451
I'd like to have a
drink with both of you.

47:46.452 --> 47:51.201
And I have taken one of
your cruises with my wife

47:51.202 --> 47:54.785
and it was, frankly, delightful.

47:54.786 --> 47:57.452
Well, thank you, Senator,
that's very kind.

48:05.535 --> 48:07.952
No, no. Careful!

48:12.118 --> 48:15.951
Hi. Hi, Shiv Roy.
Thank you for seeing me.

48:15.952 --> 48:18.451
I just wanted the
opportunity to say hello.

48:18.452 --> 48:20.117
And I want to say I realize

48:20.118 --> 48:22.076
this is an incredibly
difficult situation,

48:22.077 --> 48:24.576
so I... I want you to know
I deeply appreciate you

48:24.577 --> 48:26.242
- taking the time.
- Right. Um...

48:26.243 --> 48:28.910
I'm not sure I should... I...
I thought this was gonna be

48:28.911 --> 48:31.451
a very unofficial thing with Rhea?

48:31.452 --> 48:32.618
Uh-huh. Yeah.

48:32.619 --> 48:34.201
Uh... This feels very different.

48:34.202 --> 48:38.284
No, she's busy. Uh... But
she will join later on.

48:38.285 --> 48:39.701
- I...
- Right. I j... I...

48:39.702 --> 48:41.660
I just don't know if I feel comfortable.

48:41.661 --> 48:44.618
Oh, but I'm not here
to stop you testifying.

48:44.619 --> 48:48.326
- Sure.
- Yeah. And I'm not here to offer you anything.

48:48.327 --> 48:52.493
I'm here to listen, and
to try to understand.

48:52.494 --> 48:55.201
Just trying to understand what
we did wrong and how I can fix it.

48:55.202 --> 48:58.159
Well, it's a very convenient
time to show up...

48:58.160 --> 49:00.494
- wanting to understand.
- Oh...

49:02.744 --> 49:05.952
- I think you're brave.
- Well, thank you.

49:08.077 --> 49:11.451
Honey, no. No, get down.
Don't go too high.

49:11.452 --> 49:14.493
Come here! Come here!

49:14.494 --> 49:16.785
What? Oh, my God! Ah!

49:16.786 --> 49:18.576
There we go!

49:18.577 --> 49:22.034
Oh, wow. These just kill me.

49:22.035 --> 49:24.034
I know. Come on...

49:24.035 --> 49:25.702
You know, look, um...

49:27.327 --> 49:31.034
My... My dad... My dad,
a couple months ago,

49:31.035 --> 49:32.368
you know, he screwed me over.

49:32.369 --> 49:34.911
He made me an offer that wasn't real.

49:36.285 --> 49:37.743
And he's a serial liar.

49:37.744 --> 49:39.826
And I'm gonna be very frank with you,

49:39.827 --> 49:43.369
put my cards on the table,
I don't trust him. Okay?

49:45.494 --> 49:47.076
Your firm has been very tough.

49:47.077 --> 49:48.369
Yeah, too fucking right.

49:49.577 --> 49:51.534
- Harassment?
- Yeah.

49:51.535 --> 49:54.785
Visits at night, turning up at work.

49:54.786 --> 49:59.701
Weird email stuff. I mean, I...
I... don't want to accuse you...

49:59.702 --> 50:02.701
No, it's perfectly possible.

50:02.702 --> 50:04.493
Yeah, I mean, it's out-sourced security,

50:04.494 --> 50:06.576
so who... Who knows
what could be happening?

50:06.577 --> 50:08.159
It's probably worse than you think.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.284
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

50:10.285 --> 50:12.618
But hey, you should be
safe from all that now.

50:12.619 --> 50:15.159
You've got the whip hand.
Now, they're scared.

50:15.160 --> 50:17.242
I don't think that stuff
will happen to you anymore.

50:17.243 --> 50:18.576
You don't think?

50:18.577 --> 50:20.243
Being honest, I don't know.

50:21.243 --> 50:23.743
But... it would look bad.

50:23.744 --> 50:26.409
You've broken ranks,
you're in a new category.

50:26.410 --> 50:27.868
Uh-huh.

50:27.869 --> 50:30.744
But, look... I wanna clean up.

50:31.452 --> 50:32.701
I need it all out there.

50:32.702 --> 50:34.701
- Sure.
- Yeah, no, I do.

50:34.702 --> 50:38.452
I wanna fire these bastards.
And I want you to help me.

50:39.327 --> 50:41.451
Sure.

50:41.452 --> 50:42.995
Well, I guess, you know,

50:42.996 --> 50:45.992
the only question I would
have for you is just...

50:45.993 --> 50:50.743
is this... this, you know,
the... the right forum?

50:50.744 --> 50:52.660
Okay, here it comes.

50:52.661 --> 50:55.285
Nope, honestly? A better question.

50:57.118 --> 51:00.743
What do you actually want to happen?

51:00.744 --> 51:03.910
I want people to hear
what Lester was like.

51:03.911 --> 51:06.868
How he treated me and other women.

51:06.869 --> 51:09.034
I want the Hewson story to come out.

51:09.035 --> 51:12.951
How she went overboard... and
there was no rescue attempt,

51:12.952 --> 51:15.077
because they thought it was a stowaway.

51:15.952 --> 51:17.619
"No real person involved."

51:18.619 --> 51:19.619
Right.

51:22.993 --> 51:24.661
Hey, you want to sit down?

51:26.827 --> 51:27.950
I mean, the good thing is,

51:27.951 --> 51:30.159
you're gonna have a lot
of people on your side.

51:30.160 --> 51:34.202
Who will... Who will sing your
name, and back you up, and...

51:35.494 --> 51:38.034
Yeah.

51:38.035 --> 51:41.451
But the other people?
You know, the other side?

51:41.452 --> 51:44.786
Normal people, they will doubt you.

51:45.993 --> 51:48.494
They'll say... terrible things.

51:49.410 --> 51:50.661
They'll call you a slut...

51:51.827 --> 51:54.951
and a whore, and a money-grubber.

51:54.952 --> 51:57.034
Your life is gonna get ripped apart.

51:57.035 --> 51:59.576
Your home, you'll want to move out.

51:59.577 --> 52:02.242
For two or three days, you're
gonna be kind of famous,

52:02.243 --> 52:04.826
but then the caravan moves on.

52:04.827 --> 52:06.744
I just think it's what I have to do.

52:08.243 --> 52:12.117
Yeah, true. No, I get it. That's good.

52:12.118 --> 52:16.951
But from tomorrow,
that's... all you'll ever be.

52:16.952 --> 52:20.284
To your grandkids, to the
people you meet on vacation.

52:20.285 --> 52:22.117
When they google you, yeah?

52:22.118 --> 52:25.701
Pages and pages of filth and lies.

52:25.702 --> 52:28.702
First line of your obituary. Last line.

52:29.661 --> 52:30.702
Uh-huh.

52:32.661 --> 52:35.869
So, what is it that
you are trying to get?

52:37.827 --> 52:41.618
Because money? Money you can have.

52:41.619 --> 52:46.284
That's easy. Book deal.
Interview appearances.

52:46.285 --> 52:48.951
We will give you millions of dollars...

52:48.952 --> 52:52.410
and I will destroy the men
who ran that dirty operation.

52:53.494 --> 52:55.910
I will kill them for what they've done.

52:55.911 --> 52:58.242
And I want you to help me.

52:58.243 --> 53:01.910
We will be the best, cleanest
operation in the world

53:01.911 --> 53:05.243
because of you, if you help me do this.

53:07.494 --> 53:08.744
Would you help me?

53:11.661 --> 53:13.410
Well, it... it sounds...

53:16.243 --> 53:17.535
Can I trust you?

53:19.202 --> 53:22.117
No. No, actually, no.

53:22.118 --> 53:25.201
Kira, you're in a shitstorm
of conflicting interests here.

53:25.202 --> 53:29.660
You can't trust anyone.
You just have to be smart.

53:29.661 --> 53:31.785
So, listen to everyone
and make an assessment.

53:31.786 --> 53:35.327
'Cause frankly, I want
what's best for me.

53:36.118 --> 53:37.534
But the other people?

53:37.535 --> 53:39.409
The folks who want you
to get up there tomorrow,

53:39.410 --> 53:42.494
and get pulled apart? They
want what's best for them.

53:44.118 --> 53:46.619
You need to think about
what's best for you, huh?

53:53.577 --> 53:55.618
- Mm.
- Hey. Hey!

53:55.619 --> 53:57.451
- Mm-hm?
- Hey, Roman.

53:57.452 --> 53:58.951
- What?
- Wake up.

53:58.952 --> 54:00.785
Hey!

54:00.786 --> 54:03.993
- Good, man, good?
- All good. All good.

54:05.869 --> 54:09.951
Hello. Hi. I'm so sorry.

54:09.952 --> 54:11.692
Foreign nationals,

54:11.693 --> 54:14.076
- please identify yourselves.
- Oh, my God.

54:14.077 --> 54:16.034
- Oh, fuck.
- What do you think?

54:16.035 --> 54:18.576
Uh... I don't know. I
feel like, traditionally,

54:18.577 --> 54:20.660
Americans don't usually
fare well at this point.

54:20.661 --> 54:22.159
I don't know, what do you think, Karl?

54:22.160 --> 54:23.951
- Oh, fuck.
- Just do what he says.

54:23.952 --> 54:25.992
Yeah, okay. Um...

54:25.993 --> 54:28.034
- Roman Roy?
- Yup.

54:28.035 --> 54:29.285
Follow me, please.

54:30.577 --> 54:32.869
- Good luck.
- Yeah. Uh...

54:34.285 --> 54:35.951
Good luck to you, too.

54:35.952 --> 54:38.452
- Go, Hi... Hearts.
- Go, Hearts.

54:43.619 --> 54:45.826
Anyway, thank you for your support.

54:45.827 --> 54:47.409
You got it. All the time.

54:49.369 --> 54:50.826
- Yes?
- Great job.

54:50.827 --> 54:52.242
- Thank you.
- I salute you.

54:52.243 --> 54:53.701
- Thank you, Senator.
- Excellent job.

54:53.702 --> 54:55.034
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

54:55.035 --> 54:56.910
- Here, here.
- Cheers, Bill.

54:56.911 --> 54:57.992
Well done.

55:06.452 --> 55:08.785
Lovely to reconnect with the gang.

55:08.786 --> 55:11.034
I appreciate your support, Bill.

55:11.035 --> 55:14.034
Are you kidding? So many memories, huh?

55:14.035 --> 55:18.534
I should write a book. I
could. I've got the diaries.

55:18.535 --> 55:22.744
But no time. No time!

55:25.535 --> 55:26.661
You okay?

55:27.786 --> 55:31.034
- You... did great.
- Thank you.

55:31.035 --> 55:34.159
It must've been tough, but
you did it, she dropped out.

55:34.160 --> 55:37.535
"Personal reasons". Yeah, you did good.

55:38.047 --> 55:39.256
Thank you.

55:44.869 --> 55:47.368
So, are you okay, kiddo?

55:47.369 --> 55:50.034
Yeah. Yeah, good.

55:50.035 --> 55:54.951
You, uh... You feeling... feeling okay?

55:54.952 --> 55:58.326
I'm, uh... I'm sorry if it was rough.

55:58.327 --> 56:03.910
No, it was... it was fine.
We're good. It's all good.

56:03.911 --> 56:07.660
Hey, Logan? Rhea's here,
but she... she wants a word.

56:07.661 --> 56:08.725
Okay.

56:08.726 --> 56:10.135
You remember Naomi Pierce?

56:10.136 --> 56:12.789
- Yeah, yeah. Hi.
- She came down to to support us.

56:21.087 --> 56:22.129
Hey.

56:23.577 --> 56:24.786
Oh!

56:25.857 --> 56:29.117
So, as you know, I didn't go in.

56:29.118 --> 56:32.868
Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine. Shiv's tough.

56:32.869 --> 56:35.868
Look. Will you tell me what happened?

56:35.869 --> 56:37.409
You can ask me anything.

56:37.410 --> 56:42.576
No. I don't know what
to ask. You tell me.

56:42.577 --> 56:46.452
Well, it's all... You know.

56:47.952 --> 56:50.451
It goes a long way back.

56:50.452 --> 56:52.951
Did you... Did you ever have an editor

56:52.952 --> 56:54.826
who put a hand up a sweater?

56:54.827 --> 56:57.827
Well, things were done
differently in those days.

56:58.535 --> 56:59.786
I can't fly blind.

57:01.118 --> 57:03.242
Was Lester McClintock a friend of yours?

57:03.243 --> 57:05.785
No, I wouldn't say he was a friend, no.

57:05.786 --> 57:08.035
You once told me he was a close friend.

57:09.494 --> 57:11.409
- You told me that.
- Well...

57:11.410 --> 57:13.785
Friend, close friend,
colleague, I don't know.

57:13.786 --> 57:17.368
It's kind of a... a
superpower, isn't it?

57:17.369 --> 57:21.076
If you can lie to someone
like that, to their face.

57:21.077 --> 57:22.576
I mean, I know you're lying,

57:22.577 --> 57:25.160
but I still find you very
plausible and appealing.

57:27.911 --> 57:29.618
I misspoke.

57:29.619 --> 57:30.786
Uh-huh.

57:31.827 --> 57:33.326
Forgive me.

57:33.327 --> 57:36.409
But there are some things
that went on from time to time,

57:36.410 --> 57:38.159
and I just wanted to protect you.

57:38.160 --> 57:42.534
- I don't need your protection.
- Well, you know, as the next CEO,

57:42.535 --> 57:46.576
it might be wise to keep
clean of certain areas.

57:46.577 --> 57:48.327
I've been thinking about that.

57:49.911 --> 57:52.661
I'm not sure it works any longer.

57:53.952 --> 57:55.117
So, what do you want?

57:55.118 --> 57:56.785
I'm not sure I want to work for you.

57:56.786 --> 57:58.660
Fine, you've got me over a barrel.

57:58.661 --> 58:01.076
You know it, I know it,
so tell me what you want

58:01.077 --> 58:03.326
- and let's get into it.
- You don't understand.

58:03.327 --> 58:06.076
I'm out. I don't want
to be part of this.

58:06.077 --> 58:09.202
Oh, come on. Fuck off!

58:12.410 --> 58:13.744
Little Miss Prim.

58:16.202 --> 58:17.369
You knew.

58:19.911 --> 58:21.743
You know who I am.

58:21.744 --> 58:25.826
I think it's changed. In the details.

58:25.827 --> 58:28.493
You don't walk over details.

58:28.494 --> 58:30.702
I can't see the bottom of the pool.

58:31.993 --> 58:36.118
I... I... I don't know if
you care about anything.

58:37.577 --> 58:39.910
- And that scares me.
- Oh, yeah.

58:39.911 --> 58:45.743
Fucking words. Fucking
words. Come on. Stay!

58:45.744 --> 58:51.077
I could always find someone else.

58:52.911 --> 58:55.076
You know you're fungible.

58:55.077 --> 58:58.826
- I am not fungible.
- Oh, yes, you are.

58:58.827 --> 59:01.201
You're as fungible as fuck.

59:01.202 --> 59:02.494
Fine.

59:03.993 --> 59:08.618
Then funge me. Go ahead. Try.

59:13.118 --> 59:14.118
Rhea.

59:20.827 --> 59:23.404
Kendall Roy served
self-satisfied hypocrites

59:23.405 --> 59:26.951
on the senate commerce committee
a healthy portion of reality pie

59:26.952 --> 59:30.451
today when he delivered them
a takedown for the ages.

59:30.452 --> 59:31.818
Democrats on the committee

59:31.819 --> 59:32.910
- had worked themselves...
- Hmm.

59:32.911 --> 59:34.868
- So...
- ... into a fit of phony outrage

59:34.869 --> 59:36.785
- over historic corporate...
- Rhea's gone?

59:36.786 --> 59:39.117
- But they made a fatal miscalculation.
- Yep.

59:39.118 --> 59:41.493
She can't hack the hate.

59:41.494 --> 59:43.159
Well, she can fuck off

59:43.160 --> 59:47.076
and enjoy her lily-white,
chicken-flesh conscience

59:47.077 --> 59:49.034
working for a fucking phone company.

59:49.035 --> 59:52.993
Yeah. Yeah, well, maybe.

59:54.911 --> 59:56.534
Yeah, but do you think that's it?

59:56.535 --> 01:00:01.660
If Kira holds, and we kill Bill,
do you think we're through?

01:00:01.661 --> 01:00:02.702
Honestly?

01:00:04.118 --> 01:00:08.159
No. Not with the shareholders.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.992
I'm afraid this Kendall
stuff won't play.

01:00:11.993 --> 01:00:16.827
They're a little more...
fucking vegetarian.

01:00:17.494 --> 01:00:19.451
- No?
- No.

01:00:19.452 --> 01:00:21.117
Yes. Yes.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:24.993
He came out like a
fighter, but I'm hurt.

01:00:26.327 --> 01:00:27.494
We're hurt.

01:00:29.202 --> 01:00:32.326
And Bill's on maneuvers.
He won't go quietly.

01:00:32.327 --> 01:00:35.243
No, no, no. Bill's not the answer.

01:00:36.369 --> 01:00:37.744
We need something big.

01:00:40.202 --> 01:00:41.243
Yeah...

01:00:43.285 --> 01:00:45.910
Time for a blood sacrifice.

01:00:52.869 --> 01:00:56.410
Tell it like it
is, Kendall Roy. I see...

01:01:00.768 --> 01:01:08.768
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

01:02:09.734 --> 01:02:14.034
I need one meaningful skull to wave.

01:02:14.035 --> 01:02:17.868
If the shareholders meeting
were tomorrow, we lose.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.117
You know what you're looking
at if you don't go private.

01:02:21.118 --> 01:02:25.285
SEC, DOJ, Foreign and Corrupt Practices.

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:27.160
It's terminal.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:29.826
It might be humiliating.

01:02:29.827 --> 01:02:31.409
There's gonna be a head on a spike.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:32.910
Let's get the party started.

01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:34.326
Everybody thinks you're a joke.

01:02:34.327 --> 01:02:36.326
The tension, it's getting to people.

01:02:36.327 --> 01:02:37.852
If we fail, then we die.

01:02:37.853 --> 01:02:39.618
Here's the thing,

01:02:39.619 --> 01:02:41.743
I want to vote your ticket
on the fundamentals,

01:02:41.744 --> 01:02:44.159
but this thing feels so toxic...

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.952
we feel that it should be you.

01:02:50.727 --> 01:02:54.242
The magazine was one
thing, but, uh... this.

01:02:54.243 --> 01:02:56.368
You're good. A new broom.

01:02:56.369 --> 01:02:57.992
It's fun to be the new bride,

01:02:57.993 --> 01:03:00.326
rearranging the bachelor's apartment,

01:03:00.327 --> 01:03:01.910
putting flowers out.

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:04.242
It's just not nice to think
you might find a corpse

01:03:04.243 --> 01:03:05.952
in the freezer, you know, Bluebeard?

01:03:06.993 --> 01:03:08.451
We have a lot of scandals.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.317
You never quite know
when you're in the middle

01:03:10.318 --> 01:03:12.534
of the rainstorm and
when it's the first drops

01:03:12.535 --> 01:03:13.992
and when you've reached the end of it.

01:03:13.993 --> 01:03:17.493
No! I can't have this now.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:21.175
We wanted to try and give
that slightly sickening sense

01:03:21.176 --> 01:03:22.866
of, "Was that the worst moment of it

01:03:22.867 --> 01:03:25.451
and also the worst thing that
we're gonna hear happened?"

01:03:25.452 --> 01:03:26.576
We have a problem.

01:03:26.577 --> 01:03:28.326
They have someone else
for later in the week

01:03:28.327 --> 01:03:29.576
who could probably kill us.

01:03:29.577 --> 01:03:31.034
- Who?
- A victim.

01:03:31.035 --> 01:03:34.910
If she comes out and the NDAs
domino... I think that's it.

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:38.201
There's concentric circles
of levels of knowledge

01:03:38.202 --> 01:03:40.992
and you can be pretty compelling
when you persuade yourself

01:03:40.993 --> 01:03:42.743
you did or didn't know something.

01:03:42.744 --> 01:03:44.576
This supposed victim?

01:03:44.577 --> 01:03:47.034
Could you meet up with
her? You know, talk?

01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:50.368
You know, find out what
she wants? Apologize?

01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:51.868
Oh, come on.

01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:53.992
One of you. Both of you.

01:03:53.993 --> 01:03:55.159
Please.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.701
It's one of those moments

01:03:56.702 --> 01:04:00.409
where your sense of yourself
and your own moral parameters

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.910
are tested a bit, and
what's painful for them both

01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:05.242
is that they know
they've been asked to go

01:04:05.243 --> 01:04:07.902
and do that particular
job because they are women.

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:11.076
Why Shiv is able to do something

01:04:11.077 --> 01:04:13.682
which other people might find undoable

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.243
is 'cause she already feels like
they've had all those arguments.

01:04:17.243 --> 01:04:19.534
We're in the car. Now,
let's just go and do it.

01:04:19.535 --> 01:04:21.383
The good thing is you're
gonna have a lot of people

01:04:21.384 --> 01:04:23.201
on your side. But the other people,

01:04:23.202 --> 01:04:25.201
normal people, they will doubt you.

01:04:25.202 --> 01:04:27.076
Your life is gonna get ripped apart.

01:04:27.077 --> 01:04:29.786
From tomorrow, that's
all you'll ever be.

01:04:30.744 --> 01:04:32.389
We were just thinking about people's

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:33.992
personal responsibilities to take on

01:04:33.993 --> 01:04:35.743
political, cultural change,

01:04:35.744 --> 01:04:37.701
which is gonna be damaging to them,

01:04:37.702 --> 01:04:39.868
and the people who choose
to do that are very brave,

01:04:39.869 --> 01:04:41.576
but however, if it was your best friend,

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:42.785
or your mother or sister,

01:04:42.786 --> 01:04:45.118
could you, hand on heart,
tell them to do it?

01:04:45.786 --> 01:04:47.577
It's an interesting dilemma.
