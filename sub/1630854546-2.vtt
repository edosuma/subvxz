You know, you do have
that exact date on Zena's map.

it refers to a voyage

14:21.333 --> 14:23.500
MARTY:
Right. The conjecture would be

14:34.167 --> 14:36.083
And, actually, it is
kind of like a cornerstone,

14:36.208 --> 14:38.083
which is where
you'd put such things.

14:38.208 --> 14:39.792
And then they pack up and go.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.250
According to you,

14:41.375 --> 14:42.833
-to Oak Island, right?

that is a tail.

15:34.083 --> 15:37.250

the signal there.

20:17.708 --> 20:18.708
JACK:
Yep.

20:26.083 --> 20:28.417
Is it out?

20:30.167 --> 20:31.958
What the heck is this?

20:34.458 --> 20:37.292

An ornament? No.

20:38.625 --> 20:39.500

20:39.583 --> 20:41.375

20:43.458 --> 20:44.875

Look at that, I mean,
the way that comes over.

20:46.708 --> 20:50.000

comes out and across.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.500
-Uh, but it's heavily corroded.
-Yeah.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.333
GARY:
Could be, like, a-a large pin.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.917

-Or a pin.

20:56.042 --> 20:57.583

Yeah.

20:57.708 --> 21:01.000

21:23.833 --> 21:25.875
-Yeah.
-And that was
really, really old.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.208
The garnet brooch was a part
of Scott Clarke's theory.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.625
And it had something
to do with Masonic rituals.

21:31.708 --> 21:35.667
And maybe if this is
a gemstone, it somehow relates.

Okay.

Now, this is... the <i>Lively</i> was
a British merchant ship.

24:48.792 --> 24:53.958
They were privateering in
early 1746, perhaps even 1745.

24:54.083 --> 24:58.000
It was captured by one
of Duc d'Anville's squadron

24:58.125 --> 24:59.583
over by Nova Scotia.

24:59.708 --> 25:03.083
And what is interesting
about these is that

25:03.208 --> 25:05.042
when, um, the ships were taken,

25:05.208 --> 25:09.000
they were signed by
La Rochefoucauld, Duc d'Anville.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.083
-ALEX: Oh, yeah.
-MARTY: Yeah.
-CHARLES: Oh.

25:12.208 --> 25:15.375
Those are, in effect,
orders from d'Anville, right?

25:15.500 --> 25:17.125
He was the commander
of this fleet.

25:17.208 --> 25:19.250
Now, he wouldn't have done that
from France or anywhere else.

25:19.375 --> 25:20.917
He must have been there
at that time.

25:21.042 --> 25:22.792
This is 1746?

25:22.875 --> 25:25.750

Yeah, January 1746,
which I find quite early on.

25:27.375 --> 25:28.667
MARTY:
I see.

-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-That's the significance.

25:29.875 --> 25:31.250
That puts him there earlier.

25:31.375 --> 25:32.500
That seems really early
to me, yeah.

25:32.625 --> 25:33.833

26:44.708 --> 26:46.583
uh, intelligence about
the Duc d'Anville fleet,

26:46.708 --> 26:48.375

of these ships.

PAUL S.:
So this is the <i>Diamant.</i>

27:20.958 --> 27:23.583
This was a famous ship
in the d'Anville fleet.

27:24.875 --> 27:28.458
There, "The <i>Diamant</i> seized
by His Majesty's ships of war

27:28.583 --> 27:31.750
under the command
of Admiral Anson."

27:32.833 --> 27:35.917
There's a guy mentioned in here
called Hocquart,

27:36.042 --> 27:39.958
who was captain of the <i>Diamant</i>
in the original d'Anville fleet.

27:40.042 --> 27:41.875
Hocquart is captured
by Admiral Anson.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.417
Anson put him in prison and
gave him a hard time in prison.

27:44.542 --> 27:48.375
Anson obviously wanted to try
and find out something about

27:48.500 --> 27:50.042
what was on the ship.

27:50.208 --> 27:52.625
Right, so Anson comes in looking
for answers and maybe saying

27:52.708 --> 27:55.917
what was the mission
before it was captured.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.167
Then he imprisons him
and extracts that information.

27:58.292 --> 28:00.583
Yeah, he wanted to find out
what they had been up to

28:00.708 --> 28:03.875

the coast of-of Mahone Bay.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.167

of these people as prisoners

28:32.667 --> 28:34.042

<i>So, what was he after?
What did they know?</i>

28:39.292 --> 28:41.833
Anson ended up getting
letters from all sorts

28:41.958 --> 28:45.208
of top people in-in France
to try and get Hocquart out.

28:47.042 --> 28:48.833
One of the letters
that was sent from France

28:48.958 --> 28:51.958

let him out for a long time.

for a reason.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.000
They were interrogated
for a reason.

28:58.083 --> 28:59.500
It has to do with Nova Scotia.

29:20.708 --> 29:21.875
I could buy that.

29:22.042 --> 29:23.500
It would really explain

29:23.625 --> 29:25.833
the different artifacts
we're finding on Oak Island.

29:25.958 --> 29:27.667
I mean, if the French and
the British are both involved,

29:27.750 --> 29:29.208
we're finding British coins

29:29.375 --> 29:30.708
and we're finding
French artifacts.

29:30.875 --> 29:32.125
Yeah.

29:32.208 --> 29:35.167
And one explanation
is that both groups

29:35.333 --> 29:37.542
-knew about something
on Oak Island.
-PAUL S.: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.667

29:44.750 --> 29:48.000
<i>cap badges, coins

29:48.125 --> 29:51.167
<i>which suggest that both
the French and British military</i>

29:55.000 --> 29:56.833
We haven't been able
to make sense of it

29:56.917 --> 29:58.375

29:58.500 --> 30:00.083
it-it only fits,

30:00.208 --> 30:02.417
-you know, the French
or the British, not both.
-Yeah.

30:02.542 --> 30:04.542
-But this explains it.
This makes sense.
-Yeah.

an hat pin or a cloak pin--
not really sure.

<i>The thing you see most,

32:11.583 --> 32:13.833
A jewel, a sapphire.

No...

No.

It is unusual.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.708

33:02.208 --> 33:04.333
-or metal composition.
-Yeah.

33:04.458 --> 33:07.417

-of construction.
-Mm.

33:09.417 --> 33:11.333
LAIRD:
We'll be able to look inside it.

33:11.458 --> 33:13.833
And then I think
we can do a little cleaning.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.042
And then we can XRF it.

33:16.208 --> 33:19.167
And that'll tell us
certainly what the base metal is

33:19.292 --> 33:22.125
and perhaps what the jewel is.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.167
Little bit of cleaning,
little bit of scanning

33:24.250 --> 33:25.667
and a little bit of celebrating.

33:25.792 --> 33:27.083
(chuckling)

<i>ALEX:
Sure.</i>

We started at Royston Cave.
Um...

34:24.042 --> 34:25.667
<i>it's-it's not a cave.</i>

34:25.833 --> 34:27.125
<i>It's actually hand-dug</i>

34:27.208 --> 34:29.333
into the-the rock
underneath Royston.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.292
<i>And it's got</i>

34:31.417 --> 34:34.083
just an overwhelming number
of carvings in it.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.667
<i>It's larger-scale
than I expected.</i>

34:36.792 --> 34:39.708
<i>You know, there's potential
Templar symbolism there.</i>

34:39.875 --> 34:44.000
And there's some symbols that
are, you know, familiar to us

34:44.083 --> 34:46.458
<i>from other trips
that we've taken,</i>

34:46.583 --> 34:49.875
<i>like in Domme
and at Rochefoucauld Castle,</i>

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
<i>and potential connections
between both</i>

34:52.125 --> 34:54.833
<i>the Rochefoucaulds,
the Duc d'Anville</i>

34:54.917 --> 34:56.708
and Oak Island.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.000
JACK:
What kinds of symbols

34:58.125 --> 34:59.833
were you seeing
that drew connections?

34:59.958 --> 35:02.167
<i>Well, there's one in particular
that I have a photo of</i>

35:02.333 --> 35:04.292
that was, like--
I mean, it was obvious.

35:05.292 --> 35:06.750
<i>So why don't I show you
the photo.</i>

35:06.875 --> 35:08.375
<i>We'll see what you think.</i>

35:08.542 --> 35:11.208
<i>These are the carvings
in the cave.</i>

35:11.333 --> 35:12.708
<i>You know, this is just
to give you an impression</i>

35:12.875 --> 35:15.625
<i>of what we're looking at
when we go down there.</i>

35:15.750 --> 35:17.125
Oh.

35:19.375 --> 35:22.125
<i>This is the one</i>

35:22.250 --> 35:24.667
<i>that just jumped
right out at us.</i>

35:25.708 --> 35:26.667
Oh...

35:26.833 --> 35:27.792
RICK:
Hmm.

35:28.917 --> 35:30.667
<i>That's remarkable.</i>

Wow. That's stunning.</i>

<i>MARTY:
If you look at that, you know,</i>

35:39.208 --> 35:40.792
<i>there's the cross,
only in more detail.</i>

35:40.917 --> 35:42.958
Mm.

35:43.042 --> 35:45.375
GARY:
Yeah, looks like a match to me.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.167
RICK:
That's what I would say.

35:47.292 --> 35:49.500
<i>NARRATOR:
In the war room, Marty</i>

35:49.667 --> 35:52.750
<i>and Alex Lagina,

35:52.875 --> 35:56.292
<i>have just shown Rick Lagina
and members of the team</i>

35:56.375 --> 35:59.292
<i>an image of a carved cross
located in Royston Cave,</i>

35:59.375 --> 36:01.958
<i>a medieval site
near London, England,</i>

36:02.083 --> 36:04.500
<i>that many believe
to have once been</i>

36:04.583 --> 36:06.917
<i>a sacred meeting place
for the Knights Templar.</i>

36:07.042 --> 36:10.875
<i>MARTY: It's more likely than not
the Templars were in this cave</i>

36:11.000 --> 36:12.375
<i>for part of its history.</i>

36:12.500 --> 36:14.458
<i>Which makes that carving</i>

36:14.542 --> 36:16.333
Templar-ish.

36:16.458 --> 36:18.167
<i>And you couple that with Domme,</i>

36:18.292 --> 36:21.000
<i>and I think that lead cross</i>

36:21.125 --> 36:22.833
has Templar origins.

36:25.375 --> 36:26.500
<i>RICK:
Royston Cave</i>

36:26.583 --> 36:28.417
seemed to indicate
that there was

36:28.542 --> 36:30.792
<i>some sort of Templar connection
to the mystery.</i>

36:30.917 --> 36:32.958
<i>They showed a carving</i>

36:33.042 --> 36:36.583
<i>that replicated the cross
Gary found in Smith's Cove.</i>

36:36.708 --> 36:39.000
<i>Of course,
that conjures up the time</i>

36:39.125 --> 36:41.042
<i>Peter and I and Alex
went to Domme.</i>

36:41.208 --> 36:43.167
<i>Are they similar? Yes.</i>

36:43.333 --> 36:46.292
This could be quite huge.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.875
Now, does that mean
they were on Oak Island? No.

36:49.042 --> 36:53.333
<i>But it brings me a lot further
along than, say, I had been</i>

36:53.458 --> 36:55.625
-before I came here.
-Yeah.

36:55.750 --> 36:56.958
Yeah.

36:57.083 --> 36:59.667
<i>ALEX:

Oh.

37:08.625 --> 37:10.667
"1347."

37:10.750 --> 37:14.208
<i>MARTY:
That apparently is
the exact date on Zena's map.</i>

37:15.500 --> 37:17.208
<i>ALEX:
It might be
a commemorative thing</i>

37:17.375 --> 37:19.458
<i>to denote, uh,</i>

37:19.542 --> 37:21.000
when they might have left
the region.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.792
The date of 1347,

37:24.875 --> 37:28.167
<i>that was closest
to making a connection</i>

37:28.250 --> 37:29.667
<i>between the Royston Cave,</i>

37:29.792 --> 37:31.333
<i>the Templars' association

<i>and Zena's map.</i>

37:35.333 --> 37:37.417
<i>In the center of this image</i>

37:37.542 --> 37:40.958
<i>is what kind of resembles
a mermaid.</i>

37:41.042 --> 37:42.833
<i>See it?</i>

37:42.958 --> 37:44.708
RICK:
Interesting.

37:44.875 --> 37:46.250
<i>ALEX:
Until Gretchen brought it up--</i>

37:46.375 --> 37:48.042
<i>I-I did not remember this--</i>

37:48.208 --> 37:50.458
<i>but when we were
at Rochefoucauld Castle,</i>

37:50.542 --> 37:53.000
if you look
at their coat of arms,

37:53.167 --> 37:54.625
behind it is a mermaid.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.542
<i>MARTY:
That was their main symbol.</i>

37:59.708 --> 38:01.042
Yes.

38:06.208 --> 38:07.500
-Rochefoucaulds.
-Yeah.

38:07.625 --> 38:10.458
RICK:
What it somewhat reminds me of

38:10.542 --> 38:12.500
is that it kind of looks like
the fish

38:12.583 --> 38:14.542
at the bottom of the map.

38:17.375 --> 38:19.500
<i>NARRATOR:
Could Rick Lagina be correct</i>

38:19.583 --> 38:23.458
<i>that the image of a possible
mermaid carved in Royston Cave</i>

38:23.542 --> 38:26.792
<i>is also depicted on
the believed 14th-century map</i>

38:26.875 --> 38:30.917
<i>that Zena Halpern
gave the team in 2016?</i>

38:31.042 --> 38:34.750
<i>If so, could it offer
another key piece of evidence</i>

38:34.875 --> 38:37.333
<i>that the Knights Templar
really were connected</i>

38:37.458 --> 38:39.375
<i>to the Oak Island mystery?</i>

38:39.500 --> 38:41.167
<i>Uh, we'd like to tell you
a little bit</i>

38:41.292 --> 38:42.625
<i>about what happened at Kew.</i>

38:42.708 --> 38:45.292
<i>It-it appears that the...</i>

38:45.375 --> 38:48.417
Duc d'Anville was up to
all kinds of things

38:48.542 --> 38:50.458
that are yet to be discovered.

38:51.583 --> 38:54.042
<i>ALEX:
We're seeing
the Duc d'Anville made</i>

38:54.167 --> 38:56.333
multiple journeys to the region,

38:56.458 --> 38:58.708
<i>some earlier than we thought.</i>

38:58.833 --> 39:02.250
<i>MARTY:
There are records
of the interrogation</i>

39:02.375 --> 39:05.125
<i>of prisoners
that the British took,</i>

39:05.250 --> 39:07.208
apparently trying
to extract data from them

39:07.333 --> 39:09.667
after the Duc d'Anville
expedition.

39:09.750 --> 39:11.875
-Oh. Great.
-RICK: Wow.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Very cool.

39:14.125 --> 39:16.583
This story is layered, and thus,

39:16.708 --> 39:19.417
the uncovering it
or the unraveling of the story

39:19.542 --> 39:21.375
is-is complicated as well.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.167
But I think
we've got the people,

39:23.250 --> 39:25.292
-the science, the commitment...
-Yeah.

39:25.375 --> 39:28.458
...to do that very thing--
unravel it.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.167
And we couldn't do it
without everybody diving in,

39:30.333 --> 39:31.500
and you dove in.

39:31.583 --> 39:33.667
So, appreciate it. Certainly.

39:43.708 --> 39:46.542

40:01.292 --> 40:03.625
We found another bobby-dazzler.

<i>-ALEX: Oh.</i>
-I believe it's, uh,

40:08.500 --> 40:11.125
either a pin or a brooch.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.500
And you know me, Marty--

40:13.667 --> 40:15.958
I don't get excited
when I find a bit of jewelry.

40:16.042 --> 40:19.708
-No, no.
-And we shouldn't
really speculate,
