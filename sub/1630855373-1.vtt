1
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.412
Tonight's program takes us backstage

2
00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:21.957
to witness firsthand the creation,
start to finish,

3
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.793
of a new play mounted
on the American stage.

4
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.922
{\an8}Asteroid City does not exist.

5
00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:33.635
{\an8}It is an imaginary drama
created expressly for this broadcast.

6
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.556
{\an8}The characters are fictional,
the text hypothetical,

7
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:40.225
the events an apocryphal fabrication,

8
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.270
but together they present
an authentic account

9
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.982
of the inner workings
of a modern theatrical production.

10
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.360
Our story begins, of course,
with an ink ribbon.

11
00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:54.990
Conrad Earp, playwright,
native of upper Wyoming,

12
00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:58.118
well-known for
his romantic poetic tapestries

13
00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.787
of life west of the Rocky Mountains.

14
00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.211
There is little amusement
to be had, however,

15
00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.255
in watching a man type.

16
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.675
Skip ahead, then,
past the lonely, agonized months

17
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.012
of composing, revising,
polishing, editing, rewriting,

18
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.516
cutting, pasting,
pacing, doodling, and solitary drinking,

19
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.060
and join our company
as they take the stage

20
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:25.229
for their first read-through rehearsal.

21
00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:30.317
Location, the Tarkington Theater,
345 South Northwest Avenue.

22
00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.614
Curtain rises on a desert bus stop

23
00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.742
halfway between
Parched Gulch and Arid Plains.

24
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.869
Main scenography includes

25
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.996
a 12-stool luncheonette,

26
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.957
a one-pump filling station,

27
00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:47.709
and a ten-cabin motor court hotel.

28
00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.378
Upstage left,

29
00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.046
the Tomahawk Mountains.

30
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.590
Highest peak, 11,000 feet.

31
00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.635
Upstage right,
an unfinished highway overpass

32
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.887
which vaults up 20 feet,
then chops off midair

33
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.931
behind a permanent roadblock.

34
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.893
Center front, an impact crater
one hundred feet in depth and diameter

35
00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:08.605
encircled by a low Little League
variety chain-link fence.

36
00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.360
Offstage, distant, a 650-car freight train

37
00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.863
which click-clacks by
at five miles an hour.

38
00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.615
Note to chief electrician,

39
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.493
the light of the desert sun
is neither warm nor cool

40
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.370
but always clean

41
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.665
and, above all, unforgiving.

42
00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.585
Cast, Augie Steenbeck,

43
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.004
war photographer, early 40s.

44
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.090
His son Woodrow, 14,
also known as Brainiac.

45
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:39.136
Midge Campbell, late 30s, film actress.

46
00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.430
Her daughter Dinah, 15.

47
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.057
June Douglas, schoolteacher.

48
00:03:44.183 --> 00:03:46.852
Ranch hand Montana, above.

49
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.146
Grif Gibson, five-star general.

50
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:52.983
Sandy Borden, Roger Cho, J.J. Kellogg.

51
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.069
Clifford, Ricky, Shelly.

52
00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:00.115
Stanley Zak, 65, retired.

53
00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:04.912
The action of the play
takes place in September of 1955.

54
00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:08.165
Act one, Friday morning, 7:00 a.m.

55
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.667
Act two, the next day.

56
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.253
Act three, one week later.

57
00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:21.094
{\an8}Last train to San Fernando

58
00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:24.973
{\an8}Last train to San Fernando

59
00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:29.228
{\an8}If you miss this one
You'll never get another one

60
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:32.648
{\an8}Bee-dee-dee-dee-bom-bom to San Fernando

61
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.441
Last night I met my sweet Dorothy

62
00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.485
She said
"Tomorrow I join in sweet matrimony"

63
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.487
But if you act all right

64
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.447
Oh, you can take me out tonight

65
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:42.324
We can wine and dine and get back in time

66
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.786
For the last train to San Fernando

67
00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:49.873
Last train to San Fernando

68
00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.585
Last train to San Fernando

69
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.714
If you miss this one
You'll never get another one

70
00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:01.844
Bee-dee-dee-dee-bom-bom to San Fernando

71
00:07:25.988 --> 00:07:28.365
It's a dead snake.

72
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.325
Flat snake.

73
00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:33.287
Poke him in the head with this stick.

74
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.666
I wander the streets

75
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.130
And the gay crowded places...

76
00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:46.091
Five orders of flapjacks
and a black coffee.

77
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.304
But somehow it seems

78
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:53.640
That my thoughts ever stray

79
00:07:53.724 --> 00:07:55.309
To our last...

80
00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:56.476
Who needs to pee?

81
00:07:56.602 --> 00:07:58.020
-Nobody needs to pee.
-I don't.

82
00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.813
Our average speed is 83 feet per second.

83
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.191
Poor fuel efficiency
due to excess wind resistance.

84
00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:03.483
Probably the luggage rack.

85
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.694
Based on data before
the loss of power, obviously.

86
00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.905
High in the sky...

87
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.823
What do you
little princesses want to drink?

88
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.491
-Oh, we're not princesses.
-I'm a vampire.

89
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:13.285
I'm a mummy in Egypt
who got buried alive...

90
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.120
-I suck people's blood.
-...and came back to life

91
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.331
-with its head chopped off.
-I'm a fairy.

92
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.668
How about a glass of strawberry milk?

93
00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:25.714
What was that?

94
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.716
Another atom bomb test.

95
00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.360
I've seen this combination
of symptoms twice before

96
00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.695
in the '52 Estate model.

97
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.783
In one case,
it was a quick fix of a 75-cent part.

98
00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:54.910
In the other case,
it was a difficult, costly,

99
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:59.373
time-consuming disassembly and re-mantling
of the entire drivetrain

100
00:08:59.498 --> 00:09:01.500
and lubrication mechanism,
which didn't work.

101
00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:03.210
The motor exploded itself,

102
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.337
and the body was stripped
and sold for scrap.

103
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:06.964
There it is.

104
00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.764
Well, which one have we got?

105
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.558
We're about to find out.

106
00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.592
You got the first one.

107
00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:53.177
-How much do I owe you?
-Nothing.

108
00:09:53.302 --> 00:09:54.803
Ten dollars for the tow.

109
00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:01.560
What's that? Wh-What's that?

110
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:03.812
I don't know.

111
00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:19.828
I think you've got a third problem
we've never seen before.

112
00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:28.003
Zak residence.

113
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.713
Romulus, this is Augie Steenbeck.

114
00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.590
Good morning, Mr. Augie. The gate is open.

115
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.550
-No, we're not there.
-You're not here?

116
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.011
-May I speak to Mr. Zak?
-Yes, Mr. Augie.

117
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.904
-You're not here?
-We're not there.

118
00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.864
The car exploded. Come get the girls.

119
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.449
The car exploded?

120
00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:00.035
Parts of the car exploded itself, yes.

121
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.787
-Come get the girls.
-I'm not their chauffeur.

122
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:03.205
I'm their grandfather.

123
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.457
-Where are you?
-Asteroid City.

124
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.459
Farm Route Six, mile 75.
Come get the girls.

125
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.127
I have to stay here with Woodrow.

126
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:10.337
What are you talking about?

127
00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:12.214
The thing for Woodrow. We're there.

128
00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:15.759
Hmm.

129
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.265
-Hello?
-How'd they take it?

130
00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:26.812
They didn't.

131
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.021
-No?
-No.

132
00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.439
-No.
-Yes.

133
00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:31.525
-You didn't tell them still?
-I still didn't tell them.

134
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.277
-You promised.
-I know.

135
00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:36.864
The time is never right.

136
00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.533
The time

137
00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:42.119
is always wrong.

138
00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.629
Are you okay?

139
00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:54.715
No.

140
00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:00.804
You never liked me, did you?

141
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.807
I never loved you.

142
00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:05.809
You always thought
I wasn't good enough for her.

143
00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:07.060
Yes. We're saying the same thing.

144
00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.565
-Gas up the Cadillac.
-Okay.

145
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.941
-Tell the kids.
-I will.

146
00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:14.943
I'll be there when I get there.

147
00:12:28.207 --> 00:12:29.833
It's the end of that car.

148
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.752
Andromeda, check under the floor mats.
Come on.

149
00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:33.629
Pandora, check the side pockets.

150
00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.589
Cassiopeia, check the cracks
between the seats.

151
00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.633
Take everything.
What do you think, Woodrow?

152
00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:39.092
I think it's kind of sad.

153
00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.569
Rest stop, 13 minutes.

154
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:45.158
- Head count.
- One.

155
00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:46.577
Two. Three. Four.

156
00:13:46.702 --> 00:13:47.911
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

157
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.496
-Nine. Ten.
-All present.

158
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.248
Let's give thanks
for a safe journey. Billy?

159
00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.126
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank thee kindly
for a terrific bus ride.

160
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:55.544
I ate three boxes of Cracker Jacks,

161
00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:58.380
got a dog whistle and a miniature map
of the original 13 colonies.

162
00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.465
Also, we saw a coyote
get run over by a 14-wheeler

163
00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:02.134
and left him flat as a pancake.

164
00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:03.343
Boy, oh, boy. What else?

165
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.721
The bus driver had to stop twice
because Bernice couldn't hold it.

166
00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:06.889
- Could so.
- Amen.

167
00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.307
Amen.

168
00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:10.058
Lunchtime. Line up single file.

169
00:14:12.728 --> 00:14:14.396
My word. It's hot.

170
00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:16.982
It's the desert. What'd you expect?

171
00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:18.984
I don't know if I expected
one thing or another,

172
00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:20.861
but I'm wilting like a cut petunia.

173
00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:22.529
-Humans don't wilt.
-Don't they?

174
00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:25.782
No, wilting is a phenomenon
by which a petal, leaf, or stem...

175
00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.242
Do you dare me?

176
00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.995
-Dare you what?
-To eat this hot pepper.

177
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.497
-It's an experiment.
-No, don't do it.

178
00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.085
Hot pepper.

179
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:39.171
Holy Toledo. That's Midge Campbell.

180
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.839
-Where? Who?
-Right smack in back of you.

181
00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.341
Don't look.

182
00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.593
That must be her bodyguard.

183
00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:46.929
Mr. Cho, yes? Hello.

184
00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:49.473
You're in cabin seven. Well, tent seven.

185
00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.391
Here's the key, but there's no door.

186
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:53.101
Just a flap. Tent flap.

187
00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:54.603
-Tent?
-I know.

188
00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:56.813
I upgraded the electrical system
Tuesday morning.

189
00:14:56.939 --> 00:15:00.067
Better lighting, power for the ice machine
and a wall-mounted bug zapper.

190
00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:03.612
Unfortunately, a mistake got made,
and cabin seven burned to the ground.

191
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.198
-It's a tent now.
-We don't want to sleep in a tent.

192
00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:07.533
Of course. I understand.

193
00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:09.660
May I say, I think
you'll find it very comfortable.

194
00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:13.080
-Is the young gentleman in distress?
-He's thirsty.

195
00:15:13.205 --> 00:15:14.748
Of course. I understand.

196
00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:17.125
Uh, juice preference, please?
Apple, orange, or tomato?

197
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.629
Excuse me, sir?

198
00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:23.006
This bucket of nuts just stole my quarter.

199
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.424
I beg your pardon.

200
00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:29.388
She lived so long till her head got bald

201
00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.390
Taken a notion not to die at all

202
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.141
Ida Red, Ida Red

203
00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:35.519
I'm a plumb fool about Ida Red...

204
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:42.276
You're probably wondering
why we didn't pack your mother's suitcase.

205
00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:46.738
It's because she's not
coming with us on this journey.

206
00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:49.032
She can't come.

207
00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:51.577
She got too sick.

208
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.872
And, to put it bluntly,
after all the surgeries,

209
00:15:54.997 --> 00:15:56.957
therapies and interventions...

210
00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:59.835
...after two years
of struggling and suffering,

211
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.837
she succumbed to her illnesses.

212
00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.298
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:06.133
I didn't know how to tell you then.

214
00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.135
I couldn't figure out
how to tell you later.

215
00:16:08.427 --> 00:16:09.720
I didn't know what to do.

216
00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:11.847
The time was never right.

217
00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:16.310
You're saying
our mother died three weeks ago?

218
00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.480
Yes.

219
00:16:20.606 --> 00:16:22.524
When is she coming back?

220
00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:25.110
She's not coming back.

221
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.030
Let's say she's in heaven.

222
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.491
Which doesn't exist for me, of course,
but you're Episcopalian.

223
00:16:33.202 --> 00:16:34.828
Come here. Let me hug you.

224
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:43.086
Okay. Sit back down.

225
00:16:50.302 --> 00:16:52.930
Did you know already, Woodrow?

226
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.808
I think so.

227
00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.020
She'd been away so long.

228
00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:01.271
Mmm-hmm.

229
00:17:02.773 --> 00:17:04.107
Yeah.

230
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.234
We're gonna be okay.

231
00:17:06.652 --> 00:17:08.069
Your grandfather's on his way.

232
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.113
We're gonna stay with him
for a period of time

233
00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:12.574
which is yet to be determined
how long it's gonna be.

234
00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:15.786
Is she in there?

235
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.290
Yeah.

236
00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:23.377
She's in the Tupperware.

237
00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.297
Cremated.

238
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.096
Are we orphans now?

239
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.641
Huh?

240
00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:40.060
Are we orphans now?

241
00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:42.521
No.

242
00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.189
Because I'm still alive.

243
00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:50.988
When my father died,
my mother told me, "He's in the stars."

244
00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.783
I told her,
"The closest star, other than that one,

245
00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:56.451
"is four and half light-years away

246
00:17:56.535 --> 00:17:59.037
"with a surface temperature
over 5,000 degrees centigrade."

247
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:01.707
"He's not in the stars," I said.

248
00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:03.250
"He's in the ground."

249
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.377
She thought it would comfort me.

250
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:07.045
She was an atheist.

251
00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:09.923
The other thing she'd say
which is incorrect...

252
00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:11.884
"Time heals all wounds."

253
00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:13.051
No.

254
00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:15.179
Maybe it can be a Band-Aid.

255
00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:18.599
Your concept of time is
completely distorted, though.

256
00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:22.311
I don't think any of you except Woodrow
even understands what 15 minutes means.

257
00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:26.190
Fifteen minutes is 6,200 hours.

258
00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:30.569
Exactly.

259
00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:32.863
That's not your fault.

260
00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.289
If you could have anything
in the world to eat right now,

261
00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:43.790
what would it be?

262
00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.588
The character of Augie Steenbeck

263
00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.798
in the imaginary tale of our production

264
00:18:51.924 --> 00:18:54.593
was to become famously
and indelibly connected

265
00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.845
to the actor who created the role,

266
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.348
a former carpenter
discovered in a bit part

267
00:18:59.473 --> 00:19:01.683
by the play's director, Schubert Green.

268
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.852
I've finished my correspondence, Analisse.

269
00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:05.604
Please bring me my cocktail and my pill.

270
00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:07.356
-Remember, the gentleman...
-Oh, no.

271
00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:08.440
...referred by Mr. Green has arrived.

272
00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.108
No. Send him away.

273
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:12.027
Put him up
at the Salty Skipper or the Lighthouse Inn

274
00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:14.905
and tell him to come back in the morning
but not before 11:00.

275
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.617
The occasion of the first meeting
between playwright and player is now,

276
00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.285
in our fanciful telling,

277
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.871
a matter of theatrical lore and legend.

278
00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.916
Setting, late autumn, late afternoon,

279
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.961
a seaside village
outside the grand metropolis.

280
00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:31.588
Oh, no, again.
I-I beg your pardon. I'm sorry.

281
00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.258
Did Miss Watson not inform you?
I'm indisposed.

282
00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:36.343
I know, but the ice cream would've melted.

283
00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.561
-What's this?
-I think it's the one you like.

284
00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:48.313
{\an8}Gooseberry Wriggle from the Frosty Spoon
on East Rotterdam.

285
00:19:48.397 --> 00:19:50.566
{\an8}I wrapped it in sawdust,
newspaper, and peanut shells.

286
00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:53.402
{\an8}You shouldn't waste your spending money
on an old fool like me.

287
00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:56.405
{\an8}Well, they gave me ten dollars bus fare,
so I bought us a half bucket, hitchhiked,

288
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.990
{\an8}and pocketed the change.

289
00:20:03.662 --> 00:20:05.330
Cool and delicious.

290
00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:08.667
How long have you been in the service?

291
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.044
The service? What service?
I don't know what you're talking about.

292
00:20:11.128 --> 00:20:13.046
Well, unless I've been
deliberately misinformed,

293
00:20:13.172 --> 00:20:14.923
I believe those stripes
indicate the status

294
00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.675
of a ranking corporal, second class.

295
00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:19.887
Oh, no. I-I'm G.I. Number Three
in Bugle Boy Blows the Blues.

296
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.180
Was, anyway. We closed tonight.

297
00:20:21.305 --> 00:20:23.557
I see.
Property of the wardrobe department.

298
00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:24.975
Not anymore.

299
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:28.896
How was it, by the way?

300
00:20:30.147 --> 00:20:31.565
-The play? It stunk.
-Mmm.

301
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.650
-Mind if I crack open a window?
-Uh, not at all.

302
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:35.110
It's sweltering, isn't it?

303
00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:37.362
Even the daisies
and buttercups are drooping...

304
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.948
That window sticks a bit.
That window sticks a bit!

305
00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:46.830
You broke my window.

306
00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:54.379
Why does Augie burn his hand
on the Quicky-Griddle?

307
00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:58.800
Well, I don't even know myself,
to tell you the truth.

308
00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:00.302
I hadn't planned it that way.

309
00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.262
He just sort of did it while I was typing.

310
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.264
Is it too extraordinary for you?

311
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.767
Uh, I guess, the way I read it,
he was looking for an excuse

312
00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:08.644
why his heart was beating so fast.

313
00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:10.187
Oh.

314
00:21:10.354 --> 00:21:12.689
Oh, what an interesting sentiment.

315
00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.566
I love that idea.

316
00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:17.528
Maybe he should say it.
It's a very good line.

317
00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:23.116
No, I suppose not. Not necessary.

318
00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:49.226
It's a fact, we're not alone.

319
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:50.978
The alien stole the asteroid.

320
00:21:51.103 --> 00:21:52.521
Long thought to be a lunar splinter

321
00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:56.275
fragmented from the lesser moon
of the hypothetical planet Magnavox-27,

322
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.485
now considered a rogue pygmy cometette,

323
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.445
according to the encyclopedia.

324
00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:02.573
Obviously, she would've said
something to him.

325
00:22:02.698 --> 00:22:04.575
I'm certain of it. Your mother, I mean.

326
00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:06.994
She would've gotten him
to tell us the secrets of the universe

327
00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:09.204
or yelled at him or made him laugh.

328
00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.081
She would've had a hypothesis.

329
00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.876
You remind me of her more than ever.

330
00:22:14.001 --> 00:22:15.419
She wasn't shy.

331
00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.296
You'll grow out of that.

332
00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:21.008
I think your sisters might be aliens,
too, by the way.

333
00:22:25.012 --> 00:22:27.431
When I met your mother, she was only 19.

334
00:22:27.723 --> 00:22:29.683
She was smoking a cigarette,
reading a paperback,

335
00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:32.352
taking a bath in a swimsuit
on a rusty fire escape

336
00:22:32.477 --> 00:22:34.855
a flight and a half
below my camera position.

337
00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:38.025
Sometimes, I sometimes still think

338
00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.402
I still hear her here

339
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:42.613
breathing in the dark.

340
00:22:47.117 --> 00:22:48.493
Who knows, Woodrow?

341
00:22:49.578 --> 00:22:51.246
Maybe she is in the stars.

342
00:23:04.885 --> 00:23:06.011
You're perfect.

343
00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:35.415
-Okay?
-Okay.

344
00:24:07.531 --> 00:24:10.284
Hold on, partner!

345
00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:15.455
- Zut alors.
- Oh, no.

346
00:24:19.543 --> 00:24:20.961
When's the next one?

347
00:24:21.086 --> 00:24:23.213
Sunday morning, I think.

348
00:24:35.142 --> 00:24:36.435
Drink your juice.

349
00:24:45.402 --> 00:24:46.695
You took a picture of me.

350
00:24:47.404 --> 00:24:48.739
Uh-huh.

351
00:24:49.823 --> 00:24:50.866
Why?

352
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.285
I'm a photographer.

353
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:55.662
You didn't ask permission.

354
00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:58.457
-I never ask permission.
-Why not?

355
00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:01.919
Because I work in trenches,
battlefields, and combat zones.

356
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:03.962
Really?

357
00:25:04.087 --> 00:25:05.255
Uh-huh.

358
00:25:06.423 --> 00:25:07.883
You mean you're a war photographer?

359
00:25:08.008 --> 00:25:09.009
Mostly.

360
00:25:09.426 --> 00:25:11.512
Sometimes I cover sporting events.

361
00:25:11.637 --> 00:25:13.639
My name is Augie Steenbeck.

362
00:25:13.764 --> 00:25:15.098
Mmm-hmm.

363
00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:20.020
What are you gonna do with it?

364
00:25:20.395 --> 00:25:21.605
That picture.

365
00:25:21.688 --> 00:25:24.942
Hmm. Well, if it's any good,
I guess I'll try to sell it

366
00:25:25.067 --> 00:25:27.277
to a magazine, now that you mention it.

367
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.947
"Midge Campbell eating a waffle."

368
00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:35.494
Make me a print first, to approve.

369
00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:37.746
Uh-huh.

370
00:25:39.873 --> 00:25:40.874
This is Dinah.

371
00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:43.627
- This is Woodrow.
- I have a question.

372
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:45.087
Uh-huh.

373
00:25:45.212 --> 00:25:48.173
-Have you ever been shot with bullets?
-Have I ever been...

374
00:25:49.132 --> 00:25:51.593
Uh, once or twice, just grazed.

375
00:25:51.677 --> 00:25:54.471
He got shrapneled
in the back of the head, too. Show her.

376
00:25:57.891 --> 00:25:59.268
Hmm.

377
00:26:02.646 --> 00:26:04.565
I don't say I forgive you yet, by the way.

378
00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:20.122
Welcome from the
United States Military-Science

379
00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:22.124
Research and Experimentation Division,

380
00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:24.251
in conjunction with
the Larkings Foundation.

381
00:26:24.376 --> 00:26:25.836
We salute you.

382
00:26:36.096 --> 00:26:38.265
Each year, we celebrate Asteroid Day,

383
00:26:38.348 --> 00:26:40.934
commemorating September 23, 3007 BC,

384
00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:44.146
when the Arid Plains Meteorite
made Earth impact.

385
00:26:45.355 --> 00:26:47.149
The itinerary for
this three-day celebration

386
00:26:47.274 --> 00:26:49.484
includes a tour
of the newly refurbished observatory

387
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.612
with Dr. Hickenlooper and her staff,

388
00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:54.489
a picnic supper of chili and frankfurters

389
00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:56.450
with an evening fireworks display,

390
00:26:57.451 --> 00:26:59.411
the viewing of the astronomical ellipses

391
00:26:59.536 --> 00:27:01.830
at its peak just before midnight tonight,

392
00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:04.208
and finally, the awarding of the annual

393
00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:07.711
{\an8}Hickenlooper Scholarship
after Monday's banquet lunch.

394
00:27:08.462 --> 00:27:10.881
Now, I'll start by presenting
the commemorative medals,

395
00:27:10.964 --> 00:27:12.799
but first, I'll do my speech first,

396
00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:15.677
which you'll also receive
in a folio edition as a souvenir.

397
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.647
Chapter One.

398
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.857
I walked to school 18 miles
each morning, milked the goats,

399
00:27:28.982 --> 00:27:30.442
plucked the chickens,
played hooky, caught fireflies,

400
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:33.403
went skinny-dipping in the watering hole,
said my prayers every night

401
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:34.905
and got whipped with
a maple switch twice a week.

402
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.198
That was life.

403
00:27:38.575 --> 00:27:39.910
Chapter Two.

404
00:27:39.993 --> 00:27:42.162
My father went off to fight
in the war to end all wars,

405
00:27:42.287 --> 00:27:43.705
it didn't, and what was left of him

406
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.832
came back in a pine box
with a flag on top.

407
00:27:45.916 --> 00:27:47.251
End of Chapter Two.

408
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.711
Next, I went to officer school,

409
00:27:49.837 --> 00:27:52.130
and 20 years passed
at the speed of a dream.

410
00:27:52.256 --> 00:27:54.758
A wife, a son, a daughter, a poodle.

411
00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:57.553
Chapter Three. Another war.

412
00:27:57.678 --> 00:27:59.680
Arms and legs blown off like popcorn,

413
00:27:59.972 --> 00:28:02.474
eyeballs gouged out,
figuratively and literally.

414
00:28:02.808 --> 00:28:06.019
The men put on shows under the palm fronds
dressed as women in hula skirts.

415
00:28:06.144 --> 00:28:07.688
That was life.

416
00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:10.148
In the meantime, somebody else's story.

417
00:28:10.274 --> 00:28:11.817
A man thinks up a number,

418
00:28:11.942 --> 00:28:13.694
divides it by a trillion,
plugs it into the square root

419
00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:15.237
of the circumference of the Earth

420
00:28:15.362 --> 00:28:17.239
multiplied by the speed
of a splitting atom,

421
00:28:17.322 --> 00:28:18.615
and voilà, progress.

422
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.576
I'm not a scientist. You are.

423
00:28:20.951 --> 00:28:22.286
End of Chapter Three.

424
00:28:22.661 --> 00:28:25.205
Junior Stargazers and Space Cadets,

425
00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.624
we watch transfixed as you enter

426
00:28:27.749 --> 00:28:30.919
into uncharted territories
of the brains and spirit.

427
00:28:31.044 --> 00:28:33.797
If you wanted to live
a nice, quiet, peaceful life,

428
00:28:34.214 --> 00:28:36.216
you picked the wrong time to get born.

429
00:28:37.843 --> 00:28:39.386
That's my speech.

430
00:28:48.103 --> 00:28:50.564
Be notified, you are each
the guardian of your own safety.

431
00:28:51.023 --> 00:28:53.483
Maintain alert caution
throughout the following demonstrations.

432
00:28:55.152 --> 00:28:58.697
To Ricky Cho, for his work in the field
of aeronautical induction,

433
00:28:58.989 --> 00:29:01.325
the Collapsing Star Ribbon of Success.

434
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.619
To Clifford Kellogg,
for his work in the study

435
00:29:03.744 --> 00:29:05.245
of particle disintegration,

436
00:29:06.747 --> 00:29:08.540
{\an8}the Black Hole Badge of Triumph.

437
00:29:08.665 --> 00:29:10.209
To Dinah Campbell...

438
00:29:10.334 --> 00:29:12.169
It's fueled by
cosmic radiation instead of sunlight.

439
00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:15.088
...for her work in the area
of botanical acceleration...

440
00:29:16.215 --> 00:29:18.509
Unfortunately, it makes
all vegetables toxic.

441
00:29:18.634 --> 00:29:20.385
...the Red Giant Sash of Honor.

442
00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:22.596
To Shelly Borden, for her work

443
00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:24.181
in the realm of mineral fabrication...

444
00:29:24.306 --> 00:29:26.225
I synthesized an extraterrestrial element.

445
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.894
It's going to be added
to the periodic table next year.

446
00:29:29.061 --> 00:29:30.979
...the Distant Nebula
Laurel Crown.

447
00:29:31.897 --> 00:29:33.565
To Woodrow Steenbeck

448
00:29:35.317 --> 00:29:37.903
for his work in the sphere
of astronomical imaging...

449
00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:45.077
It may have applications
in the development

450
00:29:45.202 --> 00:29:47.037
of interstellar advertising.

451
00:29:47.204 --> 00:29:49.248
{\an8}...the White Dwarf
Medal of Achievement.

452
00:29:54.753 --> 00:29:56.171
Our tour ends here.

453
00:29:56.296 --> 00:29:57.923
Thank you
for your attention, and thank you

454
00:29:58.048 --> 00:30:00.551
to the Larkings Foundation
for their generous funding.

455
00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:09.434
- What do those pulses indicate?
- What?

456
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.395
Oh, the beeps and blips? We don't know.

457
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.022
Indecipherable radio emissions
from outer space.

458
00:30:14.147 --> 00:30:16.149
-Probably a red herring.
-Does it change ever?

459
00:30:16.275 --> 00:30:17.985
Not to my knowledge.

460
00:30:18.318 --> 00:30:20.612
-It's a date, maybe.
-It's a date?

461
00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:22.114
-On the galactic calendar.
-Maybe.

462
00:30:22.239 --> 00:30:24.366
Mary, we think it's a date
on the galactic calendar.

463
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:26.451
- What? Wow.
- Is it always today?

464
00:30:28.412 --> 00:30:30.414
Yippee-yay

465
00:30:30.664 --> 00:30:34.459
There'll be no wedding bells for today

466
00:30:34.793 --> 00:30:38.547
I got spurs that jingle jangle, jingle...

467
00:30:39.882 --> 00:30:41.091
We thank thee for the mustard.

468
00:30:41.175 --> 00:30:43.635
We thank thee for the relish,
and we thank thee for the onions.

469
00:30:43.719 --> 00:30:45.804
-We thank thee for the pickles, and we...
-Head count.

470
00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:46.930
-One.
-Two.

471
00:30:47.055 --> 00:30:48.182
-Three.
-Four.

472
00:30:48.307 --> 00:30:49.766
-Five.
-Six.

473
00:30:49.892 --> 00:30:51.560
-Dwight? Where's Dwight?
-Eight.

474
00:30:51.685 --> 00:30:54.146
- Dwight? Dwight?
- Less than 0.0000% chance exists

475
00:30:54.271 --> 00:30:56.231
of extraterrestrial life
in the entire universe.

476
00:30:56.356 --> 00:30:57.774
-Dwight!
-It's a scientific fact.

477
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.693
Other than space bugs
and microscopic worms.

478
00:30:59.776 --> 00:31:01.445
-I assertively disagree.
-So do I.

479
00:31:01.528 --> 00:31:03.655
-It's not a scientific fact.
-It's not even a number.

480
00:31:03.739 --> 00:31:05.115
-Pass the pickles, please.
-How's the chili?

481
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.825
-Fine, once you add the hot sauce.
-Thank you.

482
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.285
- Sparkler?
- Consider the constants...

483
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:09.953
endless space and immeasurable time.

484
00:31:10.078 --> 00:31:12.247
The likelihood is increased
by a factor of infinity.

485
00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:14.416
-Where'd you get that?
-The cantina machine.

486
00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:16.627
- Where's the cantina machine?
- The cantina machine?

487
00:31:17.628 --> 00:31:20.005
Can you see anything
with those on your face?

488
00:31:20.547 --> 00:31:21.924
Hmm.

489
00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:24.218
Oh, gadzooks. Wh-What'd you...

490
00:31:24.343 --> 00:31:25.719
What did you do to deserve that?

491
00:31:25.844 --> 00:31:27.054
-Nothing.
-Who hit you?

492
00:31:27.137 --> 00:31:28.430
Nobody.

493
00:31:28.639 --> 00:31:30.849
It's greasepaint,
to feel like my character.

494
00:31:30.974 --> 00:31:33.393
Oh. How does she get a black eye?

495
00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:34.603
In the story.

496
00:31:34.728 --> 00:31:36.063
Well, she doesn't in the story.

497
00:31:36.188 --> 00:31:38.023
-It's on the inside.
-Okay.

498
00:31:38.148 --> 00:31:40.275
-It's supposed to be, anyway.
-It's on the inside. All right.

499
00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:41.860
The Larkings
Foundation claims permanent,

500
00:31:41.944 --> 00:31:43.320
-incontestable rights.
-That's right.

501
00:31:43.445 --> 00:31:44.696
-They're ours. We own them.
-Incontestable rights

502
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.490
to all patents or inventions derived

503
00:31:46.615 --> 00:31:48.116
from any and every submission,
without exception.

504
00:31:48.242 --> 00:31:49.785
Not for teenagers. Read the fine print.

505
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.495
The projects all belong to Uncle Sam.

506
00:31:53.372 --> 00:31:57.251
I call it "Triple Orbit and Return
without Burning Up in the Atmosphere."

507
00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.345
Why are you sitting there all by yourself?

508
00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:10.514
-You.
-Hmm?

509
00:32:11.473 --> 00:32:13.225
Uh, are you shy?

510
00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:15.269
I'm a late bloomer.

511
00:32:15.394 --> 00:32:17.062
So I've been told by my parents.

512
00:32:17.312 --> 00:32:20.065
-Are you intimidated by us?
-No.

513
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.234
Let's do a personality test.
What's your name again?

514
00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:23.944
Woodrow L. Steenbeck.

515
00:32:24.069 --> 00:32:25.571
-Hmm.
-What's the "L" for?

516
00:32:25.696 --> 00:32:27.698
- Lindbergh.
- Everybody look at Woodrow.

517
00:32:32.077 --> 00:32:34.955
I agree. Shy but not intimidated.

518
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.540
Move over here, Woodrow.

519
00:32:49.636 --> 00:32:51.638
-Brainiac, huh?
-Yeah, brainiac.

520
00:32:51.722 --> 00:32:53.265
It sort of goes
without saying, doesn't it?

521
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.684
Everybody already knows
we're abnormally intelligent.

522
00:32:55.809 --> 00:32:58.103
That's true. My mother made it for me.

523
00:32:58.228 --> 00:33:00.564
It's supposed to be funny,
according to her sense of humor,

524
00:33:00.689 --> 00:33:02.691
but it's not as hilarious
as it was originally.

525
00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:04.318
Oh, really? How come?

526
00:33:04.443 --> 00:33:07.070
Because she was alive then.
Now she's dead.

527
00:33:07.863 --> 00:33:09.198
-Oh.
-Ha-ha.

528
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:13.410
What was she like?

529
00:33:14.536 --> 00:33:15.913
My... Oh, my mother?

530
00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:18.457
She was, um...

531
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:24.922
Like this.

532
00:33:33.472 --> 00:33:34.890
When did you lose her?

533
00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:40.729
Officially, this morning,
but I think I already knew.

534
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.731
Howdy.

535
00:33:43.398 --> 00:33:44.775
What are you doing up there?

536
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.777
Just enjoying the desert air.

537
00:33:47.444 --> 00:33:49.446
- You dare me?
- Dare you what?

538
00:33:49.655 --> 00:33:51.073
To jump off this bungalow.

539
00:33:51.198 --> 00:33:53.992
-It's an experiment.
-No.

540
00:34:00.332 --> 00:34:02.084
I love gravity.

541
00:34:02.167 --> 00:34:04.962
It might be my favorite
law of physics at the moment.

542
00:34:07.005 --> 00:34:08.924
Players of the stage,

543
00:34:09.299 --> 00:34:11.969
a tribe of troubadours and nonconformists.

544
00:34:12.553 --> 00:34:15.304
They lead unconventional,
sometimes dangerous lives,

545
00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.475
which nourish and elevate
their artistic aspirations

546
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.726
and illuminate the human condition.

547
00:34:20.853 --> 00:34:22.813
Next, ten weeks later,

548
00:34:22.938 --> 00:34:25.732
the eve of Asteroid City's
first public preview.

549
00:34:25.858 --> 00:34:28.318
A drawing room on board
the Apache Plainsliner

550
00:34:28.443 --> 00:34:30.404
bound for the California coast.

551
00:34:30.529 --> 00:34:32.614
It's open.

552
00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:36.702
Schubert says you got to come back.

553
00:34:37.786 --> 00:34:39.871
If I'm so important,
why isn't he here himself?

554
00:34:39.996 --> 00:34:41.873
Probably too busy.
Too busy to go chasing after you.

555
00:34:41.998 --> 00:34:43.458
They sent me. You know who I am?

556
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:45.168
I think so. Understudy.

557
00:34:45.293 --> 00:34:47.629
The understudy.
That's right. Let me just, uh...

558
00:34:49.922 --> 00:34:51.757
He said, if you're crying,
I read you this one.

559
00:34:51.967 --> 00:34:53.260
No, that's not it. Here it is.

560
00:34:53.385 --> 00:34:55.094
If you're hopping mad,
I read you this one.

561
00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.263
Give me both.

562
00:34:56.388 --> 00:34:57.806
Not what he said. He said, if...

563
00:34:57.973 --> 00:34:59.224
Give me both.

564
00:35:05.689 --> 00:35:07.482
"Tell her she's a stuck-up, low-class snob

565
00:35:07.566 --> 00:35:09.067
"but she's got no good reason to be.

566
00:35:09.151 --> 00:35:10.611
"If she sasses you, sass her back.

567
00:35:10.694 --> 00:35:11.862
"Tell her she's a borderline neurotic

568
00:35:11.945 --> 00:35:13.197
"with an Achilles heel complex."

569
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.698
That's the second one.

570
00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:19.661
"Tell her she relies
on her beauty like a wobbly crutch.

571
00:35:19.786 --> 00:35:20.996
"It's her deepest weakness.

572
00:35:21.121 --> 00:35:22.289
"Tell her she's got the potential

573
00:35:22.414 --> 00:35:23.665
"for genuine greatness, but I say

574
00:35:23.749 --> 00:35:25.959
"with absolute certainty
she will never achieve it."

575
00:35:27.085 --> 00:35:28.253
Anything else?

576
00:35:30.797 --> 00:35:33.300
Uh-huh. He said,
if you're cool and collected,

577
00:35:33.383 --> 00:35:34.801
which I think is
what I think you seem to be,

578
00:35:34.927 --> 00:35:36.803
then that means you probably
really don't want to come back

579
00:35:36.929 --> 00:35:38.138
and I got to give you this.

580
00:35:38.263 --> 00:35:39.973
-Read it.
-Not what he said.

581
00:35:40.098 --> 00:35:42.142
He said this one's private.
Just the two of you.

582
00:35:42.267 --> 00:35:44.228
He said that... He-he said...

583
00:35:50.692 --> 00:35:52.402
"Dear Kim, I'm sorry I shouted

584
00:35:52.528 --> 00:35:54.488
"and called you
a spoiled bitch and a minor talent

585
00:35:54.613 --> 00:35:56.532
"and broke your glasses
and threw them out the window.

586
00:35:56.657 --> 00:35:58.158
"Given that I have always considered you

587
00:35:58.283 --> 00:35:59.826
"to be the most
consummately gifted living actress

588
00:35:59.952 --> 00:36:01.912
"and a person of great
intelligence and character,

589
00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:03.372
"these statements and actions

590
00:36:03.497 --> 00:36:05.541
"do not accurately reflect
my true feelings.

591
00:36:05.749 --> 00:36:07.167
"Yes, I may be a manipulative snake,

592
00:36:07.292 --> 00:36:09.336
"as you once
characterized me behind my back...

593
00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:11.880
"you see, I do have my sources,
but I love you like a sister,

594
00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:14.132
"other than that one time
in the bathroom the day we met,

595
00:36:14.258 --> 00:36:16.385
"which has never
been repeated, as we both know.

596
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:23.559
"I never meant to hurt you

597
00:36:23.684 --> 00:36:25.853
"or insult you or offend you in any way,

598
00:36:25.978 --> 00:36:28.564
"only to try
with the few tools I have at my disposal

599
00:36:28.689 --> 00:36:31.191
"to do my job, which is to make it work.

600
00:36:31.316 --> 00:36:32.693
"Forgive me.

601
00:36:32.818 --> 00:36:34.528
"We open tomorrow night,
with or without you.

602
00:36:34.987 --> 00:36:36.947
"Without, our entire devoted company

603
00:36:37.072 --> 00:36:39.491
"will suffer
complete disaster and tragic calamity,

604
00:36:39.616 --> 00:36:42.661
"as will a brilliant,
fragile genius named Conrad Earp.

605
00:36:43.161 --> 00:36:45.747
"With, you will enjoy
the triumph of your career,

606
00:36:45.873 --> 00:36:48.166
"which does not matter in the least.

607
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.712
"All that matters is
every second of life onstage

608
00:36:51.837 --> 00:36:53.338
"and our friendship.

609
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.467
"Your servant, your director
and, if I may, your devoted mentor,

610
00:36:57.593 --> 00:36:58.969
"Schubert Green."

611
00:37:05.851 --> 00:37:07.603
What's your name, understudy?

612
00:37:09.605 --> 00:37:12.399
They continued through
the night as far as Ohio,

613
00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:14.902
then disembarked
and caught the return flight

614
00:37:15.027 --> 00:37:17.946
arriving two hours prior to curtain.

615
00:37:18.197 --> 00:37:22.701
The talented understudy
immediately replaced the original Woodrow.

616
00:37:24.703 --> 00:37:27.080
I strongly question
whether your daughter's Silly Putty

617
00:37:27.206 --> 00:37:28.749
resembles anything from outer space.

618
00:37:28.874 --> 00:37:30.709
-It's not Silly Putty.
-I'm sorry, but I doubt it.

619
00:37:30.834 --> 00:37:32.085
It's called S'morestozium.

620
00:37:32.336 --> 00:37:33.670
-This is excellent.
-Thank you.

621
00:37:33.754 --> 00:37:34.963
It's really all the machine's doing.

622
00:37:35.047 --> 00:37:37.299
What the devil do you know
about astrogeology anyway,

623
00:37:37.424 --> 00:37:38.926
J.J, whatever that stands for?

624
00:37:39.051 --> 00:37:40.260
I just maintain the workings.

625
00:37:40.385 --> 00:37:41.887
Shelly's thesis is supported by...

626
00:37:42.012 --> 00:37:43.347
Flimsy, outdated evidence.

627
00:37:43.472 --> 00:37:45.015
-I beg your pardon?
-Not in my opinion.

628
00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.642
I liked the Silly Putty
or S'morestozium, in fact.

629
00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:47.976
I'm just quoting what he said.

630
00:37:48.101 --> 00:37:50.812
Your son's project might very well
have killed us all today, by the way.

631
00:37:50.938 --> 00:37:52.564
Coming from the family that brought us

632
00:37:52.648 --> 00:37:53.899
-the electromagnetic death ray.
-It's a weapon.

633
00:37:54.024 --> 00:37:55.984
-Of course it's lethal.
-So you admit it.

634
00:37:56.193 --> 00:37:57.903
Not to mention Brainiac's flag.

635
00:37:58.028 --> 00:37:59.655
I mean, is he trying
to provoke World War III or something?

636
00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.365
The jet propulsion belt is eminently safe.

637
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.075
I'd allow an eight-year-old boy
to operate it.

638
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.035
In fact, I did... Ricky's cousin Chip,

639
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.329
and he broke
the solo flight altitude record.

640
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.831
They're strange, aren't they?

641
00:38:09.915 --> 00:38:11.792
Your children, compared to normal people.

642
00:38:12.084 --> 00:38:13.252
-Yes.
-That's correct.

643
00:38:13.377 --> 00:38:14.962
-It's true.
-Hmm.

644
00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:17.339
After that, the second person

645
00:38:17.422 --> 00:38:19.299
says the name the first one said,
then adds another.

646
00:38:19.383 --> 00:38:21.134
Then the third person
says both plus a new name.

647
00:38:21.218 --> 00:38:23.345
And then the next person keeps going,
and so on in a circle.

648
00:38:23.428 --> 00:38:24.471
It's a memory game. Get it?

649
00:38:24.555 --> 00:38:25.722
I'll start. Cleopatra.

650
00:38:25.848 --> 00:38:27.474
Cleopatra, Jagadish Chandra Bose.

651
00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:28.684
-Like that?
-Exactly.

652
00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:30.185
- Of course. Yes.
- Got it.

653
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.604
Cleopatra, Jagadish Chandra Bose,

654
00:38:32.729 --> 00:38:34.857
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.

655
00:38:35.065 --> 00:38:36.608
Cleopatra, Jagadish Chandra Bose,

656
00:38:36.733 --> 00:38:39.862
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Paracelsus.

657
00:38:40.237 --> 00:38:41.822
Cleopatra, Jagadish Chandra Bose,

658
00:38:41.905 --> 00:38:45.200
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,
Paracelsus, uh, Kurt Gödel.

659
00:38:45.284 --> 00:38:46.368
Oh, the Vienna Circle.

660
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:47.870
-The Austrian logician.
-Correct.

661
00:38:49.413 --> 00:38:50.998
Cleopatra,

662
00:38:51.123 --> 00:38:53.000
Jagadish Chandra Bose,

663
00:38:53.125 --> 00:38:54.960
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,

664
00:38:55.085 --> 00:38:56.378
Paracelsus,

665
00:38:57.087 --> 00:38:58.589
Kurt Gödel,

666
00:38:59.089 --> 00:39:00.674
- William Bragg.
- Which one?

667
00:39:00.757 --> 00:39:02.342
- There's two.
- William Henry Bragg.

668
00:39:02.426 --> 00:39:03.844
- I prefer the son.
- The father's better.

669
00:39:03.927 --> 00:39:06.805
Cleopatra, Jagadish Chandra Bose,

670
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.640
- Antonie van...
- Leeuwenhoek.

671
00:39:09.099 --> 00:39:11.310
Paracelsus, Kurt Gödel,

672
00:39:11.435 --> 00:39:12.686
William Henry Bragg.

673
00:39:13.478 --> 00:39:14.771
-And the new one.
-Lord Kelvin.

674
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.024
Cleopatra, Jagadish Chandra Bose,

675
00:39:17.107 --> 00:39:19.234
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,
Paracelsus, Kurt Gödel,

676
00:39:19.318 --> 00:39:21.278
William Henry Bragg, Lord Kelvin...

677
00:39:22.154 --> 00:39:23.947
Midge Campbell. Can I say her?

678
00:39:24.072 --> 00:39:26.074
As long as she's a real person,
you can say anybody you like.

679
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.826
Cleopatra,
Jagadish Chandra Bose...

680
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.494
- Including my mother.
- She's my idol.

681
00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:31.788
My turn. Jagadish Chandra Bose,
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,

682
00:39:31.872 --> 00:39:34.208
Paracelsus, Kurt Gödel,
William Bragg, the father,

683
00:39:34.291 --> 00:39:36.210
Lord Kelvin, the mathematical physicist,

684
00:39:36.293 --> 00:39:37.836
Midge Campbell, your mother,

685
00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:40.255
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,
the rocket scientist.

686
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.049
I don't know if this game works with us.

687
00:39:42.549 --> 00:39:45.177
Uh, brainiacs, I mean.
I-I think it might go on forever.

688
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.345
I don't mind.

689
00:39:46.428 --> 00:39:49.056
In my school, nobody'd play
this game with me in a million years.

690
00:39:49.389 --> 00:39:50.766
Plus, the names would be too obvious.

691
00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:52.643
I know my next one... Diophantus.

692
00:39:52.809 --> 00:39:54.269
Wait until it's time to say it.

693
00:39:54.353 --> 00:39:55.812
Try it backwards, Brainiac.

694
00:39:56.313 --> 00:39:57.648
Say the new one first.

695
00:39:59.942 --> 00:40:01.401
Hojo Tokiyuki,

696
00:40:02.277 --> 00:40:03.695
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,

697
00:40:04.154 --> 00:40:06.031
Midge Campbell, Lord Kelvin,

698
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:08.367
William Henry Bragg, Kurt Gödel,

699
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:11.036
Paracelsus, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,

700
00:40:11.161 --> 00:40:12.788
Jagadish Chandra Bose...

701
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.124
Cleopatra.

702
00:40:30.556 --> 00:40:32.432
Put out that cigarette, Dwight.

703
00:40:33.517 --> 00:40:34.935
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

704
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.437
You men should be
ashamed of yourselves. Are you?

705
00:40:37.521 --> 00:40:39.022
Yes, ma'am, but we didn't give him that.

706
00:40:39.106 --> 00:40:40.107
-Didn't you?
-That cigarette.

707
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.233
He just must have got it his own self...

708
00:40:41.316 --> 00:40:43.235
-Dwight!
-...from the cigarette machine.

709
00:40:47.197 --> 00:40:48.657
I almost believe you.

710
00:40:48.782 --> 00:40:49.992
Let's go.

711
00:40:52.828 --> 00:40:54.580
-So long, Dwight.
-So long, Dwight.

712
00:41:13.182 --> 00:41:14.850
Was I ever there?

713
00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:17.561
Was I ever there?

714
00:41:18.896 --> 00:41:21.148
Was I ever there?

715
00:41:26.236 --> 00:41:27.738
Memorizing my lines.

716
00:41:27.946 --> 00:41:29.198
Uh-huh.

717
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.953
Approved.

718
00:41:43.837 --> 00:41:48.509
As I walked out in the streets of Laredo

719
00:41:48.675 --> 00:41:53.013
As I walked out in Laredo one day

720
00:41:53.138 --> 00:41:55.224
I spied a young cowboy...

721
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:56.725
I do a nude scene. You want to see it?

722
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:02.189
-Huh? Did I say yes?
-You didn't say anything.

723
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:04.483
Uh, I meant yes.
My mouth... My mouth didn't speak.

724
00:42:04.566 --> 00:42:05.651
It's a monologue.

725
00:42:05.776 --> 00:42:07.653
Pretend it starts
when I step out of the shower.

726
00:42:07.778 --> 00:42:09.863
That you are a cowboy

727
00:42:09.988 --> 00:42:11.740
These words he did say

728
00:42:11.865 --> 00:42:14.826
As I boldly walked by

729
00:42:14.952 --> 00:42:19.498
Come sit down beside me
and hear my sad story

730
00:42:19.623 --> 00:42:24.211
I'm shot in the breast
and I know I must die...

731
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.590
When you first picked me out
of the secretarial pool,

732
00:42:28.715 --> 00:42:31.093
I had $111 in my bank account.

733
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.471
I lived alone with a cat and a parakeet
in a one-room dishwater flat.

734
00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:38.058
I sold the DeSoto to lend you
the down payment for my engagement ring.

735
00:42:38.183 --> 00:42:39.393
It was spring.

736
00:42:39.518 --> 00:42:40.853
I'm not sore.

737
00:42:41.186 --> 00:42:42.604
I know you're a good man.

738
00:42:43.272 --> 00:42:44.606
I'm not sorry.

739
00:42:44.731 --> 00:42:46.149
I never deceived you.

740
00:42:46.942 --> 00:42:49.152
Remember me as a blur
in the rearview mirror.

741
00:42:49.444 --> 00:42:51.029
Was I ever there?

742
00:42:51.154 --> 00:42:52.781
Did you actually see me?

743
00:42:54.908 --> 00:42:56.952
I can't even see myself anymore.

744
00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:00.497
But here I am.

745
00:43:05.169 --> 00:43:06.461
Let's get divorced.

746
00:43:11.175 --> 00:43:12.259
It'll be done tastefully, of course.

747
00:43:12.342 --> 00:43:14.553
We cut to the back of my legs
when the towel falls down.

748
00:43:16.722 --> 00:43:18.932
Sometimes... They sometimes
do a stunt double.

749
00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:20.475
Sometimes.

750
00:43:21.059 --> 00:43:23.020
I don't know if I like beards, by the way.

751
00:43:23.145 --> 00:43:24.396
Oh.

752
00:43:24.521 --> 00:43:25.939
Can I take another picture?

753
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.608
Not for publication.

754
00:43:28.817 --> 00:43:30.277
I thought you never ask permission.

755
00:43:34.615 --> 00:43:35.991
Don't move.

756
00:43:44.917 --> 00:43:46.710
I prefer to play abused,
tragic alcoholics,

757
00:43:46.835 --> 00:43:48.795
and one day,
I'll probably be discovered lifeless

758
00:43:48.921 --> 00:43:50.714
in an overflowing bathtub
with an empty bottle

759
00:43:50.839 --> 00:43:53.050
of sleeping pills spilled
all over the floor,

760
00:43:53.926 --> 00:43:57.721
but the sad thing is
I'm actually a very gifted comedienne.

761
00:43:57.971 --> 00:43:59.890
-That's true.
-Are you married?

762
00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:02.601
I'm a widower, but don't tell my kids.

763
00:44:02.726 --> 00:44:04.311
-Why not?
-I-I...

764
00:44:04.436 --> 00:44:06.230
-I mean, I wasn't going to.
-All right. Okay.

765
00:44:06.355 --> 00:44:08.315
- Yeah.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

766
00:44:08.398 --> 00:44:10.484
Thank you. They do know, by the way,

767
00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:11.735
but just barely.

768
00:44:20.953 --> 00:44:24.122
What do you swap for
out of this particular jukebox, mister?

769
00:44:24.206 --> 00:44:27.084
Of course. I understand.
This machine sells land.

770
00:44:27.167 --> 00:44:28.919
-Land, you say?
-Yes, indeed.

771
00:44:29.044 --> 00:44:30.671
The properties just beyond
these cottages, in fact.

772
00:44:30.796 --> 00:44:32.130
Out of this here soda pop machine?

773
00:44:32.256 --> 00:44:33.382
Yes, indeed.

774
00:44:35.843 --> 00:44:37.594
Well, now,
I ain't calling you a liar to your face,

775
00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:39.847
but that sounds to me like
some kind of toadswindle.

776
00:44:39.972 --> 00:44:41.557
Of course. I understand.
It's not a toadswindle.

777
00:44:41.682 --> 00:44:44.768
You put in the money, you receive
a notarized deed to the land.

778
00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:46.395
How big a spread?

779
00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.855
For $10 in quarters,

780
00:44:48.272 --> 00:44:49.940
approximately half a tennis court.

781
00:44:57.364 --> 00:44:58.949
Put the potion in it.

782
00:45:00.284 --> 00:45:02.536
Friskity, triskity, briskity, boo.

783
00:45:02.828 --> 00:45:05.163
Knickerty, knockerty, tockerty, too.

784
00:45:07.207 --> 00:45:11.712
And with this spell,
Mama comes back alive!

785
00:45:12.504 --> 00:45:14.381
God save these bones.

786
00:45:21.513 --> 00:45:23.140
What's in the Tupperware?

787
00:45:23.348 --> 00:45:25.267
Freight train, freight train

788
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.102
Going so fast...

789
00:45:28.103 --> 00:45:29.521
He finally told you.

790
00:45:31.315 --> 00:45:33.942
I don't know what train he's on

791
00:45:34.067 --> 00:45:37.696
Won't you tell me where's he gone...

792
00:45:41.742 --> 00:45:43.243
Who's this old man?

793
00:45:43.452 --> 00:45:44.912
Poppy, I think.

794
00:45:45.204 --> 00:45:46.705
You don't remember me.

795
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:48.498
I remember his smell.

796
00:45:56.715 --> 00:46:00.302
We're not going to abandon my daughter
at a motel in the middle of the desert,

797
00:46:00.385 --> 00:46:02.346
buried next to the communal showers.

798
00:46:04.223 --> 00:46:05.516
You're ruining the funeral!

799
00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:06.683
He's making her go to hell!

800
00:46:06.767 --> 00:46:09.436
If you torture us, we'll sacrifice you.

801
00:46:10.395 --> 00:46:11.730
I understand.

802
00:46:11.855 --> 00:46:14.483
Thank you for your clarity.

803
00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:17.903
I'll tell you what, let's leave her

804
00:46:17.986 --> 00:46:19.446
alone in the ground
until tomorrow morning.

805
00:46:19.571 --> 00:46:22.950
Then we'll exhume the Tupperware,
bring her with us in the Cadillac

806
00:46:23.534 --> 00:46:25.202
and bury her again
this weekend in the backyard

807
00:46:25.327 --> 00:46:26.995
next to the seventh hole at Rancho Palms,

808
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.039
where I live
in a beautiful house with a swimming pool.

809
00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:30.207
Agreed?

810
00:46:30.374 --> 00:46:31.500
-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay.

811
00:46:33.752 --> 00:46:35.712
Let's hope a coyote doesn't
dig her up in the meantime.

812
00:46:35.838 --> 00:46:37.548
Nothing we can do about it anyway.

813
00:46:39.174 --> 00:46:40.801
Ooh. Look at that.

814
00:46:56.942 --> 00:46:58.735
Tonight, you're in for a real treat.

815
00:46:58.902 --> 00:47:02.447
I don't know how many of you ever observed
an astronomical ellipses before.

816
00:47:02.531 --> 00:47:04.491
In fact, can we get a show of hands?

817
00:47:05.826 --> 00:47:07.119
Nobody?

818
00:47:07.452 --> 00:47:09.121
Wow. Okay.

819
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.250
Well, what you're gonna see
is a very simple dot-dot-dot...

820
00:47:13.375 --> 00:47:15.878
three pinpoints of light
inside your refracting box,

821
00:47:16.003 --> 00:47:18.130
which may not sound
very exciting at first,

822
00:47:18.255 --> 00:47:21.091
until you consider how those dots
managed to transmit themselves

823
00:47:21.216 --> 00:47:25.470
across a thousand billion miles of space
onto that little scrap of black cardboard.

824
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.848
Twice every 57 years,

825
00:47:27.973 --> 00:47:29.725
when the Earth, the sun, the moon,

826
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.476
and the galactic plane of the Milky Way

827
00:47:31.602 --> 00:47:34.354
all combobulate along the same
angle of orbital interest,

828
00:47:34.479 --> 00:47:37.816
the radiant energy of three
neighboring stellar systems

829
00:47:37.941 --> 00:47:39.526
induces a parallel ecliptic transit,

830
00:47:39.651 --> 00:47:41.445
thus all but proving

831
00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.822
the hypothesis of celestial flirtation.

832
00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:46.658
The hitch, of course,
is that the math doesn't work.

833
00:47:46.783 --> 00:47:48.452
But maybe one of you one day

834
00:47:48.577 --> 00:47:50.662
will be the genius
who solves that problem.

835
00:47:50.996 --> 00:47:53.332
The event will begin in 30 seconds.

836
00:47:53.916 --> 00:47:56.210
Remember, if you look directly
at the ellipses

837
00:47:56.293 --> 00:47:57.544
rather than through your refracting box,

838
00:47:57.669 --> 00:47:59.338
not only will you
not actually see the effect

839
00:47:59.463 --> 00:48:00.964
but you will burn the dots

840
00:48:01.089 --> 00:48:02.883
straight into your retina,
probably permanently.

841
00:48:03.008 --> 00:48:05.219
I know that for a fact,
because they're still burned into mine

842
00:48:05.344 --> 00:48:07.262
from when I was 11 going on 12.

843
00:48:07.387 --> 00:48:09.765
That's when I realized
I wanted to be an astronomer,

844
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:11.016
which is another story.

845
00:48:11.141 --> 00:48:12.142
Here we go.

846
00:48:38.961 --> 00:48:40.045
There it is.

847
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.130
Ooh!

848
00:48:42.422 --> 00:48:45.384
Uh, these are just such
marvelously luminous colors, aren't they?

849
00:48:45.634 --> 00:48:47.803
Very exciting. Does everybody see it?

850
00:48:47.886 --> 00:48:50.138
I don't. I just see a staple.

851
00:48:54.351 --> 00:48:56.019
Yipe! It works.

852
00:48:57.187 --> 00:48:58.689
Are you Shelly?

853
00:48:59.106 --> 00:49:00.148
Yeah.

854
00:49:00.232 --> 00:49:02.025
I'm your idol. What's your rank?

855
00:49:02.568 --> 00:49:03.861
Commanding secretary.

856
00:49:04.403 --> 00:49:05.904
I was a Cookie Trooper myself.

857
00:49:06.029 --> 00:49:07.447
Really? Wow.

858
00:49:07.573 --> 00:49:09.533
What'll they say in Squad 75?

859
00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:15.080
Hmm?

860
00:51:57.242 --> 00:52:00.454
The, uh, alien stole the asteroid.

861
00:52:15.177 --> 00:52:18.889
{\an8}Schubert Green,
born Shylock Grzworvszowski.

862
00:52:18.972 --> 00:52:20.599
Director, immigrant.

863
00:52:20.724 --> 00:52:24.645
Known for his limitless energy,
his voracious enthusiasms...

864
00:52:24.811 --> 00:52:27.064
a well-known actress
described him sexually

865
00:52:27.189 --> 00:52:29.858
as an animal, specifically a rabbit,

866
00:52:29.983 --> 00:52:32.819
and his long, deep,
and intimate relationship

867
00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:35.030
with success.

868
00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:37.533
What do you think, Lunky?

869
00:52:37.658 --> 00:52:38.700
Good.

870
00:52:44.706 --> 00:52:46.792
I'm not going to ask
what the hell's going on here.

871
00:52:47.042 --> 00:52:50.087
His wife Polly left him
for an all-star second baseman

872
00:52:50.212 --> 00:52:52.130
during the first week of rehearsals.

873
00:52:53.048 --> 00:52:54.633
My living quarters.

874
00:52:54.758 --> 00:52:56.635
Oh, Rose

875
00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.929
My Rose Marie...

876
00:52:59.054 --> 00:53:00.264
Sign this.

877
00:53:00.347 --> 00:53:01.557
Oh, no.

878
00:53:04.268 --> 00:53:06.520
It's Clark's report card.

879
00:53:06.645 --> 00:53:08.397
Uh-huh. What'd you think it was?

880
00:53:08.939 --> 00:53:10.983
I thought maybe we were already divorced.

881
00:53:11.108 --> 00:53:12.317
Oh.

882
00:53:12.442 --> 00:53:14.611
Not yet, but eventually.

883
00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:16.697
He made the honor roll again.

884
00:53:17.823 --> 00:53:21.535
Oh, Rose Marie

885
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.162
I love you

886
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.208
I'm always dreaming...

887
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:32.921
I'm staying at Diego's penthouse.

888
00:53:33.005 --> 00:53:35.340
Clark's at my mother's.
The apartment's empty.

889
00:53:35.465 --> 00:53:37.176
Why don't you just go home?

890
00:53:37.551 --> 00:53:39.970
I don't think I should be alone
in a building with real windows.

891
00:53:43.682 --> 00:53:45.392
Makeup cuts my hair and shaves me.

892
00:53:45.517 --> 00:53:47.227
Costumes washes my dungarees.

893
00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.063
This is where I belong, for now.

894
00:53:51.148 --> 00:53:52.649
Much better.

895
00:53:52.774 --> 00:53:54.776
-Did you do the green?
-Hmm.

896
00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.449
It's been a great ten years, Schubert.

897
00:54:00.574 --> 00:54:02.701
{\an8}I don't regret a second of it.

898
00:54:02.826 --> 00:54:04.411
{\an8}Clark still loves you.

899
00:54:05.204 --> 00:54:06.496
{\an8}I still love you.

900
00:54:07.706 --> 00:54:09.082
{\an8}But not like before?

901
00:54:10.042 --> 00:54:11.710
{\an8}But not like before.

902
00:54:20.427 --> 00:54:22.304
{\an8}Schubert Green lived
in the scenic bay

903
00:54:22.429 --> 00:54:23.805
of the Tarkington Theater

904
00:54:23.931 --> 00:54:27.643
for all 785 performances of Asteroid City.

905
00:54:27.768 --> 00:54:29.353
Dark nights, he stayed

906
00:54:29.478 --> 00:54:31.897
in the Governor's Suite
of the Nebraska Hotel.

907
00:54:32.022 --> 00:54:33.899
One last note.

908
00:54:34.316 --> 00:54:37.236
When Midge makes
her exit in Act Three, Scene Five,

909
00:54:37.319 --> 00:54:40.405
try having her say
the line after she closes the door.

910
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:43.033
Hmm. Maybe we are doomed.

911
00:54:43.951 --> 00:54:45.160
I will.

912
00:54:45.536 --> 00:54:50.791
My Rose Marie

913
00:54:51.124 --> 00:54:52.459
Goodbye.

914
00:55:38.714 --> 00:55:40.465
Here he comes.

915
00:55:41.633 --> 00:55:43.218
I've just informed the president.

916
00:55:43.802 --> 00:55:45.846
He authorized me to read
and implement the provisions

917
00:55:45.971 --> 00:55:47.931
of National Security
Emergency Scrimmage Plan X.

918
00:55:48.056 --> 00:55:49.266
Here I go.

919
00:55:50.058 --> 00:55:54.146
"The following top secret directive
was mandated into law on July 1, 1950."

920
00:55:54.897 --> 00:55:56.440
"In the event of unforeseen engagement

921
00:55:56.565 --> 00:55:58.650
"with intelligent life-form
or forms from any planet

922
00:55:58.775 --> 00:56:00.611
"not specifically defined as our Earth,

923
00:56:00.736 --> 00:56:02.821
"be advised to initiate
the following protocols.

924
00:56:03.238 --> 00:56:06.617
"One, confirm said life-form
is not operating under the guidance

925
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.452
"of any hostile foreign
terrestrial government."

926
00:56:08.535 --> 00:56:09.828
No, I don't think
he's working for the Russians

927
00:56:09.953 --> 00:56:11.413
or the Red Chinese, but you never know.

928
00:56:11.538 --> 00:56:13.165
He certainly didn't give me
that impression.

929
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:16.084
"Two, confirm the life-form
does not intend to annex,

930
00:56:16.168 --> 00:56:18.170
"colonize, vaporize,
or expropriate the resources

931
00:56:18.295 --> 00:56:20.714
"of the sovereign territories
of the United States of America."

932
00:56:20.839 --> 00:56:22.966
I doubt it. He took the asteroid and went.

933
00:56:23.091 --> 00:56:25.552
"Three, identify and detain
all possible witnesses

934
00:56:25.636 --> 00:56:26.845
"and place them under group arrest

935
00:56:26.929 --> 00:56:28.263
"for a period of no less than one week

936
00:56:28.388 --> 00:56:29.681
"defined as seven calendar days

937
00:56:29.806 --> 00:56:31.308
"during which time they be subjected

938
00:56:31.433 --> 00:56:33.352
"to a prescribed battery
of medical and psychological

939
00:56:33.435 --> 00:56:35.020
"examinations and cross-examinations."

940
00:56:35.145 --> 00:56:37.022
Standard procedure. Already in the works.

941
00:56:37.356 --> 00:56:38.732
"Four, secure the site,

942
00:56:38.815 --> 00:56:40.108
"cease the dissemination of information,

943
00:56:40.234 --> 00:56:41.860
"collect and transport

"and publicly deny

"including its existence,
for a period of no less than 100 years,

948
00:56:49.618 --> 00:56:51.453
"defined as 36,500 days."

949
00:56:51.578 --> 00:56:52.996
End of directive.

950
00:56:53.288 --> 00:56:54.623
-That's pretty clear.
-Huh.

951
00:56:54.748 --> 00:56:55.958
-What do we tell them?
-Who?

952
00:56:56.083 --> 00:56:58.627
The Junior Stargazers,
the Space Cadets, the moms and dads.

953
00:56:58.961 --> 00:57:00.963
- Midge Campbell.
- Midge Campbell.

954
00:57:01.088 --> 00:57:02.673
Tell them it didn't happen?

955
00:57:04.716 --> 00:57:08.595
No, obviously, we'll have to formulate
a suitable cover story.

956
00:57:11.849 --> 00:57:13.433
You dare me?

957
00:57:15.269 --> 00:57:17.604
-Dare you what?
-To press that button.

958
00:57:19.106 --> 00:57:21.525
I will break your neck.

959
00:57:21.608 --> 00:57:24.152
That's an alien eating an apple.
That's an alien doing jumping jacks.

960
00:57:24.236 --> 00:57:27.030
That's an alien in a top hat.
That's an alien climbing a ladder.

961
00:57:27.155 --> 00:57:28.407
That's an alien on a racehorse.
That's an alien...

962
00:57:28.532 --> 00:57:30.117
Let's take it from the top.

963
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.036
I told you 50 times,
the alien picked up the asteroid...

964
00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.580
-"Alleged" alien.
-I know what I saw!

965
00:57:34.705 --> 00:57:36.123
-It's called a meteorite.
-An extraterrestrial being.

966
00:57:36.248 --> 00:57:37.791
This is a microfiche
of your school newspaper.

967
00:57:37.916 --> 00:57:40.002
Your byline accompanies
an article criticizing

968
00:57:40.085 --> 00:57:41.587
the principal's disciplinary methods.

969
00:57:41.712 --> 00:57:43.922
-Who were your sources?
-I was in the sixth grade.

970
00:57:44.047 --> 00:57:46.008
-Just answer the question.
-And I will not name names!

971
00:57:50.762 --> 00:57:51.972
-You dared me!
-What did I say?

972
00:57:52.097 --> 00:57:53.891
-What did I say?
-You dared me!

973
00:58:02.566 --> 00:58:05.068
All right. Um...

974
00:58:05.194 --> 00:58:07.446
When I'm calling you...

975
00:58:08.655 --> 00:58:10.032
I'm going to attempt to proceed

976
00:58:10.157 --> 00:58:12.201
with the lesson plan
I originally prepared.

977
00:58:12.326 --> 00:58:14.161
Just to keep orderliness
under the circumstances.

978
00:58:14.286 --> 00:58:15.704
I expect that some...

979
00:58:15.913 --> 00:58:19.249
Some of our information about outer space
may no longer be completely accurate,

980
00:58:19.333 --> 00:58:21.627
but, anyway,
there are still only nine planets

981
00:58:21.752 --> 00:58:23.670
in the solar system,
as far as we know. Billy?

982
00:58:23.921 --> 00:58:25.506
Except now there's an alien.

983
00:58:26.465 --> 00:58:28.509
True, by all appearances.

984
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.177
Nevertheless, Neptune...

985
00:58:30.302 --> 00:58:31.929
Fourth largest planet by diameter,

986
00:58:32.054 --> 00:58:35.891
Neptune orbits the sun
only once every 165 years. Bernice?

987
00:58:36.517 --> 00:58:38.435
Maybe the alien went there.

988
00:58:39.186 --> 00:58:40.479
Well, maybe.

989
00:58:40.896 --> 00:58:44.358
I don't think anybody knows
where the alien went or came from.

990
00:58:44.525 --> 00:58:45.567
Yes, Dwight?

991
00:58:45.692 --> 00:58:47.819
At first,
I thought the alien was kind of sneaky,

992
00:58:47.945 --> 00:58:50.239
but now I think
he was probably nervous to go to Earth.

993
00:58:50.364 --> 00:58:52.157
He's never been here before, I bet you.

994
00:58:52.366 --> 00:58:53.575
Then why'd he steal our asteroid, then,

995
00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.952
if he's such a gentleman?

996
00:58:55.077 --> 00:58:56.912
These are all reasonable questions,

997
00:58:57.037 --> 00:58:59.039
but, at this time, let's stick to Neptune

998
00:58:59.164 --> 00:59:01.166
because I haven't had time
to prepare any lesson plan

999
00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:02.668
on this subject we're talking about.

1000
00:59:02.876 --> 00:59:03.919
The alien.

1001
00:59:04.002 --> 00:59:05.504
The alien, yes.

1002
00:59:07.005 --> 00:59:09.591
And, by the way,
I don't mean to evade your questions.

1003
00:59:09.716 --> 00:59:11.385
I want to emphasize that you're safe.

1004
00:59:11.593 --> 00:59:13.303
We all are, here on Earth.

1005
00:59:13.387 --> 00:59:15.848
Your parents
have been notified of at least something.

1006
00:59:15.973 --> 00:59:18.559
America remains at peace.

1007
00:59:19.184 --> 00:59:20.352
Yes, Montana?

1008
00:59:20.894 --> 00:59:23.772
I'd like to parley
a notion myself, if I could, June.

1009
00:59:23.897 --> 00:59:25.065
Um...

1010
00:59:26.024 --> 00:59:27.150
Okay.

1011
00:59:33.073 --> 00:59:34.783
I figure this here alien come from a tribe

1012
00:59:34.908 --> 00:59:36.702
we don't know nothing 'bout, do we?

1013
00:59:36.827 --> 00:59:39.413
Anything we say'd
just be pure speculation.

1014
00:59:39.538 --> 00:59:41.373
But I tell you what I reckon.

1015
00:59:41.999 --> 00:59:44.960
I reckon that alien
don't mean no harm at all.

1016
00:59:45.085 --> 00:59:46.795
I reckon he just took hisself down here

1017
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.631
to have a look-see at the land
and the peoples on it.

1018
00:59:49.756 --> 00:59:51.675
In the spirit of exploration.

1019
00:59:52.217 --> 00:59:55.429
See, I don't look on
a feller alien all suspicious-like.

1020
00:59:55.929 --> 00:59:57.431
No, he ain't American.

1021
00:59:57.556 --> 00:59:59.850
No, he ain't a creature
of God's green Earth.

1022
00:59:59.975 --> 01:00:03.395
But he's a creature
of somewheres, and so are we.

1023
01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:07.524
Now, let's show the old feller
some hospitality,

1024
01:00:07.649 --> 01:00:09.735
and if he turns out to be a dirty dog,

1025
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.320
which I reckon he ain't,

1026
01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:13.864
well, that'll be a job
for the United States armed forces,

1027
01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:15.824
and they ain't never lost a war yet.

1028
01:00:18.327 --> 01:00:19.703
Thanky-do.

1029
01:00:21.872 --> 01:00:23.498
I agree with Montana.

1030
01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:26.251
Now, Neptune.

1031
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:33.175
Tell me, where do they go?

1032
01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:36.762
The smoke rings...

1033
01:00:36.887 --> 01:00:38.597
Which way did he go?

1034
01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:41.975
Hmm. Well, I think he went from here

1035
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.437
to here to here to...

1036
01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:47.439
I don't know where.

1037
01:00:47.523 --> 01:00:48.732
My mother couldn't remember
which was which,

1038
01:00:48.857 --> 01:00:50.609
so she made up her own constellations.

1039
01:00:51.235 --> 01:00:53.362
That one's the Coat Hanger.
That one's the Leaky Faucet.

1040
01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:55.113
Over there's Fried Egg with Spatula.

1041
01:00:55.197 --> 01:00:58.033
My mother is a constellation,
or-or at least part of one.

1042
01:00:58.158 --> 01:01:00.285
A Swiss scientist named
a hypothetical star after her.

1043
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:01.537
Really? What's it called?

1044
01:01:01.662 --> 01:01:03.080
Midge Campbell X-9 Major.

1045
01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:04.873
Midge Campbell X-9...
I'm gonna look it up.

1046
01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:07.084
Is she interested
in astronomy, your mother?

1047
01:01:07.209 --> 01:01:09.253
Not exactly. She's interested in stardom.

1048
01:01:09.461 --> 01:01:10.963
I don't mean that
as a criticism, by the way.

1049
01:01:11.088 --> 01:01:12.464
It's her job to be famous.

1050
01:01:12.798 --> 01:01:15.217
Anyway, I'm sick of her face,
but I love her voice.

1051
01:01:15.717 --> 01:01:16.927
She should do more radio.

1052
01:01:18.095 --> 01:01:19.304
I never had children.

1053
01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:22.349
Sometimes I wonder if I wish I should've.

1054
01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:24.852
I discovered
a hypothetical star myself, by the way.

1055
01:01:24.977 --> 01:01:26.353
-Ooh. Where is it?
-Which one?

1056
01:01:26.436 --> 01:01:29.314
Right there. Partly blocked
by that burnt-out light bulb.

1057
01:01:38.991 --> 01:01:41.535
Uh...

1058
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.579
-What happened?
-I don't know.

1059
01:01:53.255 --> 01:01:55.048
- Oh.
- Uh...

1060
01:01:56.258 --> 01:01:57.426
After you.

1061
01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:08.103
Sometimes I think I'd feel more at home

1062
01:02:08.228 --> 01:02:10.105
outside the Earth's atmosphere.

1063
01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:15.152
Oh, wow.

1064
01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:16.820
Me, too.

1065
01:02:23.368 --> 01:02:24.745
Did it come out?

1066
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:28.290
Some people say a man...

1067
01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:30.125
-I mean the other one.
-Oh.

1068
01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:33.462
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood

1069
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:36.340
Muscle and blood and skin and bones

1070
01:02:36.465 --> 01:02:40.010
A mind that's weak
And a back that's strong...

1071
01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:42.429
Okay.

1072
01:02:43.514 --> 01:02:45.849
Another day older and deeper in debt

1073
01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:49.394
Saint Peter, don't you call me
'Cause I can't go

1074
01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:50.479
You feel different?

1075
01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:53.440
I owe my soul to the company store...

1076
01:02:53.607 --> 01:02:55.609
Hey. You feel different?

1077
01:02:56.818 --> 01:02:58.570
I don't feel anything at all.

1078
01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:01.365
-Me, neither.
-Hmm.

1079
01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.202
I'm not a good mother.

1080
01:03:05.536 --> 01:03:06.703
Uh-huh.

1081
01:03:06.828 --> 01:03:08.580
I love my daughter,
but I'm not a good mother

1082
01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:10.707
because, unfortunately for her,
she's not my first priority.

1083
01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:13.544
On account of there's always already
the thing I plan to do next.

1084
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:16.004
I love my daughter, by the way. I-I...

1085
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:17.840
I love all my children.

1086
01:03:17.965 --> 01:03:20.384
We have a magical time
when we're together.

1087
01:03:20.509 --> 01:03:22.219
I have another girl and a boy.

1088
01:03:22.344 --> 01:03:24.221
They live with
my second ex-husband in Utah.

1089
01:03:24.346 --> 01:03:26.348
-Uh-huh.
-He rarely sees them, either.

1090
01:03:26.473 --> 01:03:28.559
-Mmm-hmm.
-I wish I felt guilty at least,

1091
01:03:28.684 --> 01:03:30.853
but I don't experience that emotion,

1092
01:03:30.936 --> 01:03:32.229
if I understand it correctly.

1093
01:03:32.312 --> 01:03:33.564
- Yes.
- I've played it, of course.

1094
01:03:33.689 --> 01:03:35.357
So you're saying you never
feel guilty in real life?

1095
01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.441
Not to my knowledge.

1096
01:03:36.775 --> 01:03:38.861
I think because of my history
with violent men.

1097
01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:43.490
Starting with my father,
brother and uncles.

1098
01:03:44.116 --> 01:03:46.827
There's always
already the thing I plan to do next, too.

1099
01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:48.912
Usually, it's a war.

1100
01:03:49.037 --> 01:03:50.998
Nobody can compete with that, can they?

1101
01:03:51.373 --> 01:03:52.791
Probably not.

1102
01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.627
I did a USO tour once. It was thrilling.

1103
01:03:57.254 --> 01:04:00.382
I owe my soul to the company store...

1104
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.761
-I think I see how I see us.
-Hmm?

1105
01:04:04.887 --> 01:04:07.639
I mean, I think I know now
what I realize we are.

1106
01:04:07.764 --> 01:04:08.932
Okay.

1107
01:04:09.057 --> 01:04:10.601
Two catastrophically wounded people

1108
01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:12.728
who don't express the depths
of their pain because

1109
01:04:13.562 --> 01:04:14.855
we don't want to.

1110
01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.273
That's our connection.

1111
01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:17.774
Do you agree?

1112
01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:21.653
Uh-huh.

1113
01:04:23.447 --> 01:04:24.865
Let's, um...

1114
01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:27.409
Let's change the subject, shall we?

1115
01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:30.579
It's open.

1116
01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.959
- Hello?
- In here.

1117
01:04:39.922 --> 01:04:41.548
Hello? Hello.

1118
01:04:41.632 --> 01:04:43.133
I'm just your neighbor, Stanley Zak.

1119
01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:44.760
I wanted to make sure
you and your daughter

1120
01:04:44.885 --> 01:04:46.720
have everything
you might need at the moment.

1121
01:04:46.845 --> 01:04:48.305
Thank you. I think so.

1122
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:50.599
What a strange experience
this is, isn't it?

1123
01:04:50.724 --> 01:04:53.018
I went to law school
with your former agent, by the way.

1124
01:04:53.185 --> 01:04:54.811
-Mort?
-Mort. Yes, Mort.

1125
01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:56.021
Oh.

1126
01:04:57.523 --> 01:04:58.941
That came out.

1127
01:04:59.316 --> 01:05:01.401
Yeah, it came out.
All my pictures come out.

1128
01:05:03.612 --> 01:05:07.699
Anyway, as I say,
we're just across the driveway,

1129
01:05:07.824 --> 01:05:10.452
as my son-in-law seems
to have established.

1130
01:05:10.577 --> 01:05:12.788
Send my best wishes
to Mort and his family.

1131
01:05:12.913 --> 01:05:15.832
I will, if and when we're permitted
contact with the outside world,

1132
01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:18.085
though I don't speak to him,
to tell you the truth.

1133
01:05:19.711 --> 01:05:21.547
I love your hairdo like that.

1134
01:05:21.922 --> 01:05:23.382
Ugh, Christ.

1135
01:05:26.176 --> 01:05:27.845
You see
that wonderful crackly-patch

1136
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.764
right out there between the dead cactuses
and the dried-up riverbed?

1137
01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:32.266
-I think so.
-That's your parcel.

1138
01:05:32.391 --> 01:05:33.934
How much of it do I own?

1139
01:05:34.059 --> 01:05:36.979
Well, it's actually an interesting
financial mechanism.

1140
01:05:37.104 --> 01:05:39.356
You don't technically
own anything outright.

1141
01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:42.025
You own stock in the town
in the form of a loan

1142
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:43.402
with a 50-year maturity rate.

1143
01:05:43.527 --> 01:05:44.611
Then, at the end, the loan is forgiven.

1144
01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:45.988
-You dare me?
-How about water?

1145
01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:47.447
Of course. I understand.

1146
01:05:47.573 --> 01:05:49.283
There isn't any.
This is a desert opportunity.

1147
01:05:49.408 --> 01:05:50.742
-You dare me?
-I heard you.

1148
01:05:50.868 --> 01:05:52.411
-It's an experiment.
-I don't care anymore.

1149
01:05:52.536 --> 01:05:54.496
I dare you or I don't dare you.
It doesn't matter.

1150
01:05:54.621 --> 01:05:56.206
Do what you wish. I give up.

1151
01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:07.593
What's the cause?

1152
01:06:07.718 --> 01:06:09.178
What's the meaning?

1153
01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:11.305
Why do you always have to dare something?

1154
01:06:16.143 --> 01:06:17.269
I don't know.

1155
01:06:19.104 --> 01:06:22.191
Maybe it's because I'm afraid,

1156
01:06:22.733 --> 01:06:25.485
otherwise, nobody'll

1157
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:31.158
notice my existence

1158
01:06:32.451 --> 01:06:34.161
in the universe.

1159
01:06:44.796 --> 01:06:45.881
Dare you what?

1160
01:06:46.256 --> 01:06:47.841
Yes, dare you what?

1161
01:06:49.009 --> 01:06:50.677
To climb that cactus out there.

1162
01:06:50.802 --> 01:06:52.262
-Lord, no. No.
-Please don't.

1163
01:06:55.265 --> 01:06:56.308
Hello.

1164
01:06:56.892 --> 01:06:58.644
Hello. Hello.

1165
01:06:58.769 --> 01:07:00.896
We met before.
I'm the mother of that Cookie Trooper

1166
01:07:01.021 --> 01:07:02.773
-who idolizes you.
-I know.

1167
01:07:02.898 --> 01:07:05.275
Thought you might not
recognize me out of uniform.

1168
01:07:05.817 --> 01:07:07.361
You were very good in the one

1169
01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:09.196
about the tramp
in the brothel who gets amnesia

1170
01:07:09.321 --> 01:07:10.822
-and becomes a pediatrician.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1171
01:07:10.948 --> 01:07:12.324
-You were very authentic.
-That's actually maybe

1172
01:07:12.449 --> 01:07:13.742
my favorite character I've ever played.

1173
01:07:13.867 --> 01:07:17.079
-I don't know why nobody else liked it.
-Oh. Yes. Me, neither.

1174
01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:18.830
Thank you. Some people liked it.

1175
01:07:18.956 --> 01:07:20.707
Oh, I'm sure. I did.

1176
01:07:20.832 --> 01:07:22.125
Who hit you?

1177
01:07:26.588 --> 01:07:28.799
Am I not in this?

1178
01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:33.387
Excuse me. I'm not in this.

1179
01:07:33.512 --> 01:07:35.097
Um, who hit you?

1180
01:07:35.222 --> 01:07:37.224
-It's on the other eye.
-It's greasepaint.

1181
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:38.809
Some people did... Do like it.

1182
01:07:38.934 --> 01:07:40.435
Oh, I'm sure.

1183
01:07:40.519 --> 01:07:43.146
I thought it might have
been your second ex-husband in Utah.

1184
01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.161
If I sleep on a cot
instead of the sofa bed,

1185
01:07:58.245 --> 01:07:59.329
that might leave room for me to set up

1186
01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:00.956
a darkroom in the pool house.

1187
01:08:01.081 --> 01:08:02.374
Is that possible as a compromise?

1188
01:08:02.499 --> 01:08:03.834
It depends on the measurements.

1189
01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:05.919
-It's not that big.
-I can actually carpool the girls

1190
01:08:06.003 --> 01:08:07.754
to school by golf cart, you know.

1191
01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.298
If I cut across the 14th tee.

1192
01:08:09.423 --> 01:08:10.841
Oh, it's that close
to the elementary?

1193
01:08:10.966 --> 01:08:12.718
How can you two
even think about this?

1194
01:08:12.843 --> 01:08:15.095
The world will never be the same.

1195
01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:17.346
What happens next? Nobody knows.

1196
01:08:17.471 --> 01:08:19.265
Will he visit us again?
Will he speak to us?

1197
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.393
What will he say?
Why did he steal our asteroid?

1198
01:08:21.518 --> 01:08:23.687
Was it ours in the first place?
Does he like us?

1199
01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:25.397
-Nobody knows.
-That's true.

1200
01:08:25.522 --> 01:08:27.983
What's out there? Something.

1201
01:08:28.358 --> 01:08:30.484
The meaning of life. Maybe there is one.

1202
01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:32.487
I hope you're still Episcopalian.

1203
01:08:33.363 --> 01:08:35.240
You took his picture, Dad.

1204
01:08:39.661 --> 01:08:41.121
I'm a photographer.

1205
01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:47.461
Episcopalian?

1206
01:08:56.345 --> 01:08:57.845
You really want us, Stanley?

1207
01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:59.932
No, but you need me.

1208
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.434
She did love me, you know.

1209
01:09:02.559 --> 01:09:03.852
Who says she didn't?

1210
01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:06.270
I've been on my own
for 12 years, after all.

1211
01:09:06.395 --> 01:09:08.857
And remember,
my wife drank herself to death.

1212
01:09:08.982 --> 01:09:11.401
"Drank herself to..."
I don't know what that means.

1213
01:09:12.611 --> 01:09:15.781
In my loneliness,
or perhaps because of it,

1214
01:09:15.906 --> 01:09:18.075
I've learned not to judge people,

1215
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.161
to take people as I find them,
not as others find them,

1216
01:09:21.662 --> 01:09:23.580
and most of all, to give complete

1217
01:09:23.705 --> 01:09:26.667
and unquestioning faith
to the people I love.

1218
01:09:26.792 --> 01:09:28.752
I don't know if that includes you,

1219
01:09:29.294 --> 01:09:32.256
but it included my daughter
and your four children,

1220
01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.341
so you're welcome to stay with me

1221
01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:36.801
for as long as you wish,
whether I like it or not.

1222
01:09:36.926 --> 01:09:38.511
Which I don't, by the way.

1223
01:09:42.432 --> 01:09:44.059
Stop helping us.

1224
01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:45.978
We're in grief.

1225
01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:51.066
Me, too.

1226
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.081
Are you planning to abandon us?

1227
01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:10.627
Uh...

1228
01:10:10.836 --> 01:10:13.422
I was, as a temporary measure.

1229
01:10:13.505 --> 01:10:14.798
-What?
-But I decided against it.

1230
01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:17.009
-I knew it. I sensed it.
-I didn't.

1231
01:10:17.092 --> 01:10:18.886
I'm not the wet nurse.
I'm their grandfather.

1232
01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:20.470
I would've hired
a babysitter in addition to you.

1233
01:10:20.804 --> 01:10:23.807
I'm not planning to abandon you anymore,
even as a temporary measure,

1234
01:10:23.932 --> 01:10:25.726
which is all it ever would've been.

1235
01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:29.688
I forgive you for considering it.

1236
01:10:56.465 --> 01:10:58.717
Evening, soldier.

1237
01:10:59.259 --> 01:11:02.054
Can I ask you to stick this dime
in the pay phone for me, please?

1238
01:11:02.554 --> 01:11:05.182
All public telephone service
has been suspended until further notice.

1239
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:08.227
I know it. The thing is,
right before the hubbub yesterday,

1240
01:11:08.352 --> 01:11:10.187
I made a trunk call
to my cousin long-distance,

1241
01:11:10.312 --> 01:11:11.939
and the operator let me owe the surcharge

1242
01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.815
because all I had was three pennies.

1243
01:11:13.941 --> 01:11:16.735
I don't feel right stealing
from the telephone company.

1244
01:11:48.642 --> 01:11:50.018
Although it might convey
a different meaning

1245
01:11:50.143 --> 01:11:51.687
-on his planet.
-It's true.

1246
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:53.230
If he even has a planet, by the way.

1247
01:11:53.355 --> 01:11:54.565
-He might be nomadic.
-Hmm.

1248
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:56.942
Operator? Kismet-9770.

1249
01:11:57.025 --> 01:11:58.235
- Station to station.
- Stay on the line.

1250
01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.570
Thank you.

1251
01:12:04.157 --> 01:12:05.284
Hello? Who's calling?

1252
01:12:05.409 --> 01:12:07.411
Good evening, Mrs. Weatherford.
It's Ricky Cho.

1253
01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:09.413
-May I have a word with...
-Ricky, it's after 9:00.

1254
01:12:09.538 --> 01:12:10.873
He's already drinking his Ovaltine.

1255
01:12:10.998 --> 01:12:12.249
Can't this wait until tomorrow?

1256
01:12:12.374 --> 01:12:13.876
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Weatherford.

1257
01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:15.502
I-I wouldn't disturb you if it weren't

1258
01:12:15.627 --> 01:12:17.671
of the utmost importance
to the Weekly Bobcat.

1259
01:12:17.796 --> 01:12:20.048
I just need a minute of his time.

1260
01:12:20.174 --> 01:12:21.758
All right, Ricky. Hold the line.

1261
01:12:22.176 --> 01:12:23.594
Some kind of romance
between the two of you?

1262
01:12:23.719 --> 01:12:25.137
-Skip, Ricky Cho!
-What? Who?

1263
01:12:25.262 --> 01:12:26.513
-Who? You.
-Who?

1264
01:12:26.638 --> 01:12:27.848
-You know who.
-Us?

1265
01:12:27.973 --> 01:12:29.224
We only met yesterday.

1266
01:12:29.349 --> 01:12:30.475
I feel she doesn't like me in that way.

1267
01:12:30.559 --> 01:12:33.270
Uh-huh. Well, I think you're pretty smart,
but I think you're pretty dumb.

1268
01:12:33.395 --> 01:12:34.521
-Hello?
-Shh, shh. Hold it.

1269
01:12:34.646 --> 01:12:36.565
Skip? Ricky. We got a scoop.

1270
01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:48.785
The first hints of the future
existence of Asteroid City

1271
01:12:48.911 --> 01:12:50.954
were revealed during a special seminar

1272
01:12:51.038 --> 01:12:53.165
scheduled at the playwright's request.

1273
01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.626
Conrad Earp, how can we help you?

1274
01:12:55.751 --> 01:12:57.836
Well, the thing is, Saltzie,
I'd like to make a scene

1275
01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:01.048
where all my characters are each gently,
privately seduced

1276
01:13:01.173 --> 01:13:03.800
into the deepest,
dreamiest slumber of their lives

1277
01:13:03.884 --> 01:13:05.511
as a result of their shared experience

1278
01:13:05.636 --> 01:13:08.347
of a bewildering
and bedazzling celestial mystery.

1279
01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:10.933
-A sleeping scene.
-A scene of sleep.

1280
01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:12.434
But I don't know how to write it.

1281
01:13:12.559 --> 01:13:14.603
-Yet.
-Yet.

1282
01:13:14.728 --> 01:13:16.355
I thought, perhaps, if you

1283
01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.441
and your wonderfully talented
pupils just improvise,

1284
01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:21.652
something might reveal itself.

1285
01:13:21.777 --> 01:13:23.862
Who wasn't going to be famous?

1286
01:13:23.987 --> 01:13:27.741
On any given day,
roll call in Saltzburg Keitel's classroom

1287
01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:31.745
was a now-dazzling list
of undiscovered luminaries...

1288
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:33.497
Linus Mao.

1289
01:13:33.622 --> 01:13:35.249
Lucretia Shaver.

1290
01:13:35.374 --> 01:13:37.084
Walter Geronimo.

1291
01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:38.585
Asquith Eden.

1292
01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:40.295
Mercedes Ford.

1293
01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.173
Even, unofficially, Jones Hall.

1294
01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:46.301
What's it about, the play?

1295
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:50.138
Mmm, infinity, and I don't know what else.

1296
01:13:50.514 --> 01:13:51.765
Is there a title?

1297
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:55.477
I'm torn. Maybe The Cosmic Wilderness.

1298
01:13:55.602 --> 01:13:56.854
Do you like that one?

1299
01:13:56.979 --> 01:13:58.397
- Mmm, not really.
- Uh-uh.

1300
01:13:58.522 --> 01:14:01.316
What's the alternative? Title, I mean.

1301
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:04.278
Well, it's the name of the small town
on the California/Nevada/Arizona desert

1302
01:14:04.403 --> 01:14:05.863
where the story takes place.

1303
01:14:06.029 --> 01:14:10.200
Okay. Who here
has ever actually fallen asleep onstage

1304
01:14:10.284 --> 01:14:13.036
during a live performance
in front of a paying audience?

1305
01:14:13.328 --> 01:14:15.080
Me.

1306
01:14:15.205 --> 01:14:17.583
I spent the first three-quarters
of Act Two of The Welterweight

1307
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:19.459
on a massage table with no lines

1308
01:14:19.543 --> 01:14:21.461
till the last minute and a half.

1309
01:14:21.587 --> 01:14:23.922
One night, I nodded off.

1310
01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:26.216
- On purpose, you did this?
- No.

1311
01:14:26.425 --> 01:14:28.927
-Did you miss your cue?
-Almost.

1312
01:14:29.052 --> 01:14:31.763
I heard it, and I woke up very scared,

1313
01:14:31.847 --> 01:14:33.056
but I knew my lines.

1314
01:14:33.182 --> 01:14:34.683
-Good morning, Schubert.
-Good morning, Saltzie.

1315
01:14:34.808 --> 01:14:37.769
What brings you here today?
We haven't seen you in six weeks.

1316
01:14:37.895 --> 01:14:39.897
Lavender and Lemons opened last night

1317
01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:42.733
to very good, uh...
I might say raves, by the way.

1318
01:14:42.858 --> 01:14:44.276
I'm available.

1319
01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:48.197
What did he teach? Example.

1320
01:14:48.322 --> 01:14:50.240
Sleep, it's not death.

1321
01:14:50.365 --> 01:14:52.326
The body keeps busy, breathing air,

1322
01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:53.952
pumping blood, thinking.

1323
01:14:54.203 --> 01:14:56.288
Maybe you pay a visit to your dead mother.

1324
01:14:56.413 --> 01:14:59.208
Maybe you go to bed
with your ex-wife or husband.

1325
01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:00.876
Maybe you climb the Matterhorn.

1326
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:02.920
Connie, you wake up with a new scene

1327
01:15:03.045 --> 01:15:05.047
three-quarters written
in your head already.

1328
01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:07.674
Schubert, you wake up with a hangover.

1329
01:15:07.799 --> 01:15:09.384
Important things happen.

1330
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:11.470
Is there something to play? I think so.

1331
01:15:11.595 --> 01:15:14.181
Let's work on the scene
from the outside in.

1332
01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:15.599
Be inert.

1333
01:15:15.724 --> 01:15:16.975
Then dream.

1334
01:15:21.021 --> 01:15:22.689
Where are we, Connie? And when?

1335
01:15:22.814 --> 01:15:23.899
Talk to us.

1336
01:15:24.024 --> 01:15:25.359
Yes. All right.

1337
01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:26.902
One week later.

1338
01:15:27.027 --> 01:15:28.862
Our cast of characters' already tenuous

1339
01:15:28.987 --> 01:15:31.740
grasp of reality has further
slipped in quarantine,

1340
01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:33.784
and the group begins to occupy a space

1341
01:15:33.909 --> 01:15:36.078
of the most peculiar emotional dimensions.

1342
01:15:36.203 --> 01:15:40.082
Meanwhile, the information blockade
spearheaded by General Grif Gibson

1343
01:15:40.207 --> 01:15:41.959
has been, it appears,

1344
01:15:42.626 --> 01:15:43.919
incomplete.

1345
01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:19.997
Extra! Extra! Late edition!

1346
01:16:20.122 --> 01:16:21.665
Extra! Extra!

1347
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:23.417
Late edition!

1348
01:16:28.505 --> 01:16:31.133
I hope you're aware,
you and your accomplices may still face

1349
01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:33.552
felony prosecution,
possibly even a treason charge.

1350
01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:35.888
I'll fight it all the way
to the Supreme Court,

1351
01:16:36.013 --> 01:16:38.182
if necessary, and win.

1352
01:16:38.307 --> 01:16:40.517
This just in, from the president.

1353
01:16:41.935 --> 01:16:43.812
He's furious. Thanks a lot, Ricky.

1354
01:16:43.896 --> 01:16:45.397
I don't know what to say, General Gibson.

1355
01:16:45.522 --> 01:16:47.232
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize, Dad.

1356
01:16:47.357 --> 01:16:49.026
The public has a right to the truth.

1357
01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:51.361
-You made your point.
-This tribunal is a mockery!

1358
01:16:51.486 --> 01:16:53.071
What about Steenbeck,
who took the photograph?

1359
01:16:53.197 --> 01:16:55.032
It's on the front page
of every newspaper on the planet.

1360
01:16:55.157 --> 01:16:57.618
-Can't we arrest him, as well?
-Unfortunately, no.

1361
01:16:57.701 --> 01:16:59.036
He dropped a print in the mail

1362
01:16:59.161 --> 01:17:00.704
to his photo agency
first thing Tuesday morning,

1363
01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:03.040
and the postman got it before we did.
He's innocent.

1364
01:17:03.165 --> 01:17:05.000
Supposedly, he did a nude
of Midge Campbell, too.

1365
01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:07.044
-Midge Campbell?
-Ooh, Midge Campbell.

1366
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.339
As you know,
boys and girls, your parents arrived

1367
01:17:10.464 --> 01:17:12.257
late last night by military helicopter.

1368
01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:13.675
They've been sequestered
in that metal hut over there

1369
01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:15.302
for the past several hours
while the government scientists

1370
01:17:15.469 --> 01:17:16.803
explain the situation to them,

1371
01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:18.514
although everything's
already in the newspapers.

1372
01:17:18.597 --> 01:17:20.140
It's my understanding
they're about to go onto

1373
01:17:20.265 --> 01:17:21.892
this closed-circuit
television set at any moment.

1374
01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:23.894
Everything's connected,
but nothing's working.

1375
01:17:24.436 --> 01:17:27.189
Let's carry on with
the lesson plan, then. Billy?

1376
01:17:27.314 --> 01:17:28.899
I did the alien's flying saucer

1377
01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:31.235
with a hubcap and a chicken pot pie tin.

1378
01:17:31.735 --> 01:17:33.779
Good work. Very accurate.

1379
01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:36.740
Jupiter, fifth planet from the sun,
largest in our solar system...

1380
01:17:36.865 --> 01:17:38.116
Yes, Bernice?

1381
01:17:38.242 --> 01:17:40.285
I did the alien on his home planet.

1382
01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.789
Well done. How wonderful.

1383
01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:46.333
Due to extreme atmospheric conditions,

1384
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:49.169
an anticyclonic storm
has raged on Jupiter's surface for over--

1385
01:17:49.294 --> 01:17:50.379
Yes, Dwight?

1386
01:17:50.587 --> 01:17:52.130
I wrote a song about him.

1387
01:17:52.673 --> 01:17:56.426
Oh. Um, this may not
be the time for a musical performance.

1388
01:17:56.552 --> 01:17:57.886
Let's...

1389
01:17:58.011 --> 01:17:59.513
Uh, yes, Montana?

1390
01:17:59.638 --> 01:18:00.889
Pardon the interruption, June.

1391
01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:02.266
The boys and I heard old Dwight

1392
01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:05.269
was scribbling up a little warble,
so we learned ourselves to play it.

1393
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.611
One, two, three.

1394
01:18:14.736 --> 01:18:16.613
Howdly-dee...

1395
01:18:17.364 --> 01:18:19.408
{\an8}--Howdly-dee...

1396
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.561
- Howdly-dee, howdly-dee

1397
01:18:47.686 --> 01:18:51.356
Howdly-dee
Howdly-dee

1398
01:18:51.481 --> 01:18:54.735
Howdly-dee, howdly-dee

1399
01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:58.447
-Howdly-dee, howdly-dee
-Come on, y'all!

1400
01:18:58.572 --> 01:19:00.407
Hop on one foot, skip on two

1401
01:19:00.532 --> 01:19:02.284
Dance the Spaceman
Howdly-do

1402
01:19:02.409 --> 01:19:04.119
Bounce on four foot
Spring on three

1403
01:19:04.244 --> 01:19:05.662
Let's be spacemen
Howdly-dee

1404
01:19:05.787 --> 01:19:09.541
Howdly-dee
Howdly-dee

1405
01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:14.713
This was on an old roll
I forgot to develop in the glove box.

1406
01:19:15.839 --> 01:19:17.716
"Self-Portrait with Shrapnel."

1407
01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:26.517
Do page 45.

1408
01:19:37.277 --> 01:19:38.987
"What have you done? How could you?"

1409
01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:40.405
-It says "shouting and crying."
-Uh-huh.

1410
01:19:40.531 --> 01:19:42.699
-So shout and cry.
-"How could you!"

1411
01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:46.078
"How couldn't I?"

1412
01:19:46.203 --> 01:19:47.496
"How couldn't you?"

1413
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.164
"That's what I'm asking."

1414
01:19:49.248 --> 01:19:51.208
"It was over already. You were free.

1415
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.295
"What's the point of committing suicide
when there's nothing left to escape?"

1416
01:19:56.713 --> 01:19:59.216
"Maybe that was the problem all along."

1417
01:19:59.424 --> 01:20:02.219
"Stares for a moment."

1418
01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:04.221
And then it says I smash
everything off the shelf.

1419
01:20:04.388 --> 01:20:05.764
So smash everything off the shelf.

1420
01:20:10.143 --> 01:20:11.854
"Such a sickening waste.

1421
01:20:11.979 --> 01:20:14.690
"Think of the people. Think of the places.

1422
01:20:14.815 --> 01:20:16.817
-"Think of the world..."
-Use your grief.

1423
01:20:17.526 --> 01:20:19.778
For a rehearsal?
I'm not even in this picture.

1424
01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:21.613
I'm a war photographer.

1425
01:20:21.738 --> 01:20:23.073
Use your grief.

1426
01:20:24.616 --> 01:20:25.909
All right.

1427
01:20:29.621 --> 01:20:31.415
"Such a sickening waste.

1428
01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:37.254
"Think of the people. Think of the places.

1429
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:40.340
"Think of the world
you could have seen, Dolores."

1430
01:20:42.593 --> 01:20:44.094
"I've already seen it."

1431
01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:48.140
She still is... uh, is-is she a ghost?

1432
01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:52.895
It's not clear.

1433
01:20:53.812 --> 01:20:55.022
Uh...

1434
01:20:55.147 --> 01:20:56.773
Then the, uh... The...

1435
01:20:57.941 --> 01:20:59.902
Then the coroner comes in,
orders me out of the room.

1436
01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:01.862
I slowly turn away and close the door.

1437
01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:03.030
Scene.

1438
01:21:03.113 --> 01:21:04.448
My sandwich is burning.

1439
01:21:20.297 --> 01:21:21.798
My daughter saw us.

1440
01:21:21.924 --> 01:21:23.133
What?

1441
01:21:23.217 --> 01:21:24.968
Oh, uh, Dinah saw us.

1442
01:21:25.093 --> 01:21:27.346
Through this window,
in your bedroom yesterday.

1443
01:21:36.647 --> 01:21:38.982
Did you, uh, tell her
we were rehearsing again?

1444
01:21:40.567 --> 01:21:42.653
I didn't think of that. I should've.

1445
01:21:42.778 --> 01:21:45.113
But it's too late,
because I admitted everything.

1446
01:21:46.823 --> 01:21:48.200
Did she tell Woodrow?

1447
01:21:49.576 --> 01:21:50.702
Hard to say.

1448
01:21:50.827 --> 01:21:52.287
She can keep a secret.

1449
01:21:52.412 --> 01:21:53.789
I don't know if she will.

1450
01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:59.586
This isn't the beginning
of something, Augie.

1451
01:22:00.462 --> 01:22:01.755
Isn't it?

1452
01:22:02.923 --> 01:22:04.174
Is it?

1453
01:22:04.883 --> 01:22:05.926
Probably not.

1454
01:22:06.093 --> 01:22:07.386
Unless maybe it is.

1455
01:22:07.886 --> 01:22:09.596
I don't like the way
that guy looked at us.

1456
01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.181
-What guy?
-The alien.

1457
01:22:11.557 --> 01:22:12.599
Oh. How did he...

1458
01:22:12.724 --> 01:22:14.351
-How did he look at us?
-Like we're doomed.

1459
01:22:17.312 --> 01:22:18.772
Maybe we are.

1460
01:22:25.112 --> 01:22:26.697
What did you just do?

1461
01:22:26.822 --> 01:22:28.240
I burned my hand on the Quicky-Griddle.

1462
01:22:28.365 --> 01:22:30.158
-Why?
-It's not clear.

1463
01:22:30.284 --> 01:22:31.618
Show me.

1464
01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:34.496
You really did it.

1465
01:22:35.038 --> 01:22:36.415
That actually happened.

1466
01:22:46.592 --> 01:22:47.885
Pull.

1467
01:22:54.558 --> 01:22:57.978
How long can they keep us
in Asteroid City? Legally, I mean.

1468
01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:01.064
Well, I'm not an attorney,
but I'd say as long as they like.

1469
01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:02.524
I think we'd have to file an injunction

1470
01:23:02.608 --> 01:23:04.735
and successfully argue the case.
Six months to a year?

1471
01:23:04.818 --> 01:23:07.362
Of course, we'd also need to initiate
a civil suit for loss of income.

1472
01:23:07.487 --> 01:23:09.156
Maybe we should just walk out right now.

1473
01:23:09.281 --> 01:23:12.034
I'm not sure they could stop us
without killing somebody.

1474
01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:13.785
Interesting idea.

1475
01:23:13.994 --> 01:23:16.288
What kind
of mileage you think that jet pack gets?

1476
01:23:16.413 --> 01:23:17.664
Ask Roger or his son.

1477
01:23:17.789 --> 01:23:20.751
Apparently, he's being prosecuted
for revealing state secrets.

1478
01:23:20.876 --> 01:23:22.628
-They'll never make it stick.
-I'm in no hurry.

1479
01:23:22.753 --> 01:23:24.671
I like the desert. I like aliens.

1480
01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:26.215
Pull.

1481
01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:27.716
How'd you get that back?

1482
01:23:27.841 --> 01:23:29.134
The projects remain under secure lockdown.

1483
01:23:29.259 --> 01:23:32.054
No Stargazer is permitted personal access
without the express permission...

1484
01:23:32.137 --> 01:23:33.347
My son invented this death ray.

1485
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:34.640
That may be true, but my orders are...

1486
01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:36.099
-Step back.
-Easy, fellas.

1487
01:23:36.225 --> 01:23:37.851
-We're not in Guadalcanal anymore.
-Okay, okay, okay.

1488
01:23:37.976 --> 01:23:39.645
Everyone, please.
It's been a difficult quarantine.

1489
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:41.313
-I'll zap you right now!
-You stole your projects!

1490
01:23:41.438 --> 01:23:42.731
Goddamn it, tell them to stand down!

1491
01:23:43.232 --> 01:23:44.233
Stand down! You hear that?

1492
01:23:44.316 --> 01:23:45.526
General Gibson says, "Stand down."

1493
01:23:45.651 --> 01:23:47.027
-You married?
-Of course.

1494
01:23:47.152 --> 01:23:49.029
We'll reconfiscate
the projects at a later time.

1495
01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:50.364
Probably after dinner.

1496
01:23:51.448 --> 01:23:52.616
Try it.

1497
01:23:55.369 --> 01:23:56.954
Tab Hunter, Doris Day, out,

1498
01:23:57.079 --> 01:23:58.997
Jack the Ripper, out,
Bing Crosby, Shirley Temple,

1499
01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:01.083
out, out, Orson Welles, Lucille Ball, out,

1500
01:24:01.208 --> 01:24:03.252
Marlon Brando, out,
Queen Elizabeth, Mickey Mantle,

1501
01:24:03.377 --> 01:24:04.962
out, out, Yul Brynner, Louis Armstrong,

1502
01:24:05.087 --> 01:24:07.464
out, Lana Turner, out,
Betty Grable, Ella Fitzgerald,

1503
01:24:07.589 --> 01:24:09.925
out, out, Rock Hudson, out,
Jerry Lewis, out, out,

1504
01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:12.094
Greta Garbo, Karl Marx, out,
Joan of Arc, out,

1505
01:24:12.219 --> 01:24:13.804
Charles Darwin, Walter Pidgeon, out,

1506
01:24:13.929 --> 01:24:15.806
Emily Dickinson, Galileo, out, out,

1507
01:24:15.931 --> 01:24:17.641
Pontius Pilate, out,
Ernest Hemingway, Jackie O...

1508
01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:19.643
Who's responsible
for stealing my radio telescope,

1509
01:24:19.768 --> 01:24:21.395
my signal processing receiver

1510
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.605
and my entire spectrographical
monitoring network?

1511
01:24:25.566 --> 01:24:27.484
They're trying to contact the alien.

1512
01:24:27.609 --> 01:24:30.404
Well, I appreciate that,
but what about Dr. Hickenlooper?

1513
01:24:30.529 --> 01:24:33.323
If you're trying to contact
the alien, include me.

1514
01:24:33.615 --> 01:24:35.409
Did you hear anything from him so far?

1515
01:24:35.659 --> 01:24:37.035
- No.
- Huh.

1516
01:24:37.578 --> 01:24:39.037
What's all this?

1517
01:24:39.329 --> 01:24:41.456
I put the American flag
just to be patriotic.

1518
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.041
Now we need to really mean something.

1519
01:24:43.166 --> 01:24:45.085
A universal message,
not only to earthlings.

1520
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:47.129
We already thought of
everything we could think of...

1521
01:24:47.254 --> 01:24:50.507
a cross, a star, a four-leaf clover,
letters, numbers, hieroglyphics.

1522
01:24:50.632 --> 01:24:52.301
What's the point
of projecting a star onto the moon?

1523
01:24:52.426 --> 01:24:53.635
-Exactly.
-I ask that sincerely.

1524
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.970
How about "E equals MC-squared"?

1525
01:24:55.095 --> 01:24:56.096
-I still think it's...
-They know that.

1526
01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:57.181
-It's too easy.
-This is our chance

1527
01:24:57.264 --> 01:24:59.766
to be actually worthwhile
in our lifetimes.

1528
01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:01.476
I see what you mean.

1529
01:25:01.602 --> 01:25:03.395
-Whose turn was it?
-Oh, the middle of mine.

1530
01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.147
I'd better start over.

1531
01:25:05.564 --> 01:25:06.899
-Cleopatra, Jagadish...
-A word, Woodrow.

1532
01:25:07.024 --> 01:25:09.443
About the, uh, settings
on the spectrograph.

1533
01:25:09.568 --> 01:25:11.028
Over here, if you wouldn't mind.

1534
01:25:11.153 --> 01:25:12.613
...Kurt Gödel,
William Henry Bragg...

1535
01:25:12.738 --> 01:25:14.531
The, uh, warning label indicates

1536
01:25:14.656 --> 01:25:15.657
that the, uh...

1537
01:25:18.785 --> 01:25:21.288
It's all worthwhile in your lifetime.

1538
01:25:21.663 --> 01:25:23.290
-This, I mean.
-Okay.

1539
01:25:23.373 --> 01:25:25.125
Your curiosity is
your most important asset.

1540
01:25:25.209 --> 01:25:26.460
-Trust it.
-Okay.

1541
01:25:26.543 --> 01:25:27.794
-Trust your curiosity.
-Okay.

1542
01:25:27.878 --> 01:25:30.339
The resources of my lab
will always be available to you.

1543
01:25:30.422 --> 01:25:32.007
After this thing is over, I mean.

1544
01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:33.884
You could maybe
sort of be my protégé, if you like.

1545
01:25:34.009 --> 01:25:36.678
Oh, wow. Maybe we can prove
the hypothesis of celestial flirtation

1546
01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:37.930
and get the math right finally.

1547
01:25:38.055 --> 01:25:39.348
Wow. Let's try.

1548
01:25:39.765 --> 01:25:42.809
I think I see the dots from space
burned into your eyeballs.

1549
01:25:46.230 --> 01:25:47.564
I'm sorry about your mother.

1550
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:50.067
I miss mine, too,
and she died 46 years ago.

1551
01:25:51.693 --> 01:25:52.986
Thank you.

1552
01:25:56.031 --> 01:25:57.616
I've already petitioned the State Assembly

1553
01:25:57.741 --> 01:25:59.785
to change
the name of the town from Asteroid City

1554
01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:01.495
to Alien Landing, U.S.A.

1555
01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:04.081
This municipality
might end up being the center

1556
01:26:04.206 --> 01:26:07.167
of a vast community
of Stargazers and Space Cadets.

1557
01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:10.087
It's a historic offering.

1558
01:26:16.009 --> 01:26:18.011
As you know,
the Asteroid Day itinerary

1559
01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:19.263
had to be suspended last week

1560
01:26:19.346 --> 01:26:21.890
due to the factual reality
of our circumstances.

1561
01:26:21.974 --> 01:26:23.809
However, I have an announcement to make.

1562
01:26:23.892 --> 01:26:27.229
Dr. Hickenlooper and the Military-Science
Research and Experimentation Division,

1563
01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:28.856
in conjunction with
the Larkings Foundation,

1564
01:26:28.981 --> 01:26:33.318
have officially selected a recipient
for this year's Hickenlooper Scholarship,

1565
01:26:34.152 --> 01:26:36.488
and you're all going home
first thing tomorrow morning.

1566
01:26:36.655 --> 01:26:40.158
The president has opted to lift
the quarantine by executive decree.

1567
01:26:42.995 --> 01:26:44.580
I'd like to take this opportunity,

1568
01:26:44.705 --> 01:26:46.582
and, by the way,
all of this year's projects,

1569
01:26:46.707 --> 01:26:50.335
setting aside my own
differences of opinion with Ricky Cho,

1570
01:26:50.419 --> 01:26:52.796
were of the very highest caliber,
without exception,

1571
01:26:52.921 --> 01:26:55.632
to officially declare, uh...

1572
01:26:55.757 --> 01:26:57.009
-What's happening now?
-Scholarship...

1573
01:26:57.134 --> 01:26:58.302
-What's happening now?
-I don't know.

1574
01:26:58.802 --> 01:26:59.887
{\an8}It's today again.

1575
01:27:34.171 --> 01:27:35.464
It's been inventoried.

1576
01:27:40.552 --> 01:27:43.430
Under the provisions of National Security
Emergency Scrimmage Plan X,

1577
01:27:43.514 --> 01:27:45.057
the lifting of the quarantine,
which I just announced,

1578
01:27:45.182 --> 01:27:47.100
is now canceled or at least postponed

1579
01:27:47.226 --> 01:27:49.645
due to the unexpected
new event which just...

1580
01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:19.925
Why does Augie
burn his hand on the Quicky-Griddle?

1581
01:28:20.509 --> 01:28:22.261
I still don't understand the play.

1582
01:28:23.929 --> 01:28:25.097
What?

1583
01:28:33.772 --> 01:28:35.274
Where are you going?

1584
01:28:36.567 --> 01:28:37.985
I'll be right back.

1585
01:28:39.528 --> 01:28:42.030
I don't play him as an alien,
actually. I play him as a metaphor.

1586
01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:43.740
-That's my interpretation.
-Metaphor for what?

1587
01:28:43.866 --> 01:28:46.285
I-I don't know yet. We don't pin it down.

1588
01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:48.412
Schubert. Schubert.

1589
01:28:48.537 --> 01:28:50.539
-Schubert! Schubert!
-Huh? Yes.

1590
01:28:50.664 --> 01:28:53.000
What's wrong? Are you on?

1591
01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:54.793
Technically, but General Gibson
just started the scene

1592
01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:56.587
where the president
doesn't accept his resignation.

1593
01:28:56.712 --> 01:28:58.547
I've got six and a half minutes
before my next line.

1594
01:28:58.672 --> 01:29:00.382
I need an answer
to a question I want to ask.

1595
01:29:00.507 --> 01:29:01.550
Okay.

1596
01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:02.968
Am I doing him right?

1597
01:29:03.594 --> 01:29:04.887
Oh.

1598
01:29:05.012 --> 01:29:06.430
Well...

1599
01:29:06.555 --> 01:29:07.848
I told you before,
there's too much business,

1600
01:29:07.973 --> 01:29:10.726
with the pipe, with the lighter,
with the camera, with the eyebrow,

1601
01:29:11.059 --> 01:29:12.895
but aside from that, on the whole,

1602
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.147
in answer to your question... Sit down.

1603
01:29:17.983 --> 01:29:19.318
You're doing him just right.

1604
01:29:19.443 --> 01:29:21.778
In fact, in my opinion,
you didn't just become Augie.

1605
01:29:21.904 --> 01:29:23.113
He became you.

1606
01:29:23.238 --> 01:29:24.281
I feel lost.

1607
01:29:24.406 --> 01:29:25.908
-Good.
-He's such a wounded guy.

1608
01:29:26.033 --> 01:29:28.827
I feel like my heart is getting broken,
my own personal heart,

1609
01:29:28.952 --> 01:29:30.037
-every night.
-Good.

1610
01:29:30.162 --> 01:29:31.580
-Do I just keep doing it?
-Yes.

1611
01:29:31.705 --> 01:29:33.457
-Without knowing anything?
-Yes.

1612
01:29:33.582 --> 01:29:35.250
Isn't there supposed to be
some kind of an answer

1613
01:29:35.375 --> 01:29:36.752
out there in the cosmic wilderness?

1614
01:29:36.877 --> 01:29:37.961
Woodrow's line about the meaning of life.

1615
01:29:38.086 --> 01:29:39.213
-"Maybe there is one."
-Right.

1616
01:29:39.338 --> 01:29:40.464
Well, that's my question.

1617
01:29:42.508 --> 01:29:44.301
I still don't understand the play.

1618
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.886
Doesn't matter.

1619
01:29:46.011 --> 01:29:47.763
Just keep telling the story.

1620
01:29:49.264 --> 01:29:50.474
You're doing him right.

1621
01:29:50.724 --> 01:29:52.017
I need a breath of fresh air.

1622
01:29:52.142 --> 01:29:53.227
Huh.

1623
01:29:53.352 --> 01:29:55.354
Okay, but you won't find one.

1624
01:29:58.524 --> 01:29:59.983
Right.

1625
01:30:19.628 --> 01:30:20.796
Hello.

1626
01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:26.176
Oh. It's you, the wife
who played my actress.

1627
01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:29.179
Hmm. My scene was cut after one rehearsal.

1628
01:30:30.806 --> 01:30:33.308
-We still use your photograph.
-Hmm.

1629
01:30:36.728 --> 01:30:38.355
You remember the dialogue?

1630
01:30:39.857 --> 01:30:41.149
No.

1631
01:30:42.776 --> 01:30:45.612
We meet in a dream on the alien's planet.

1632
01:30:46.113 --> 01:30:47.656
Magnavox-27.

1633
01:30:47.781 --> 01:30:49.867
Actually, it's one of the moons of it.

1634
01:30:51.201 --> 01:30:54.246
You say, "Did you talk to the alien?"

1635
01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:56.999
I say, "Not yet."

1636
01:30:57.791 --> 01:31:00.419
You say, "Why not? I thought for sure

1637
01:31:00.502 --> 01:31:03.255
"you would've yelled at him
or made him laugh."

1638
01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:07.301
I say, "Or asked him
the secrets of the universe?"

1639
01:31:07.426 --> 01:31:09.303
You say, "Exactly."

1640
01:31:11.096 --> 01:31:13.390
I say, "I think he's shy."

1641
01:31:14.933 --> 01:31:16.727
You say,

1642
01:31:16.894 --> 01:31:19.479
"So's Woodrow,
but I'm sure he'll grow out of it.

1643
01:31:19.605 --> 01:31:22.191
"I mean, at least
I hope he will, without a mother."

1644
01:31:24.276 --> 01:31:27.779
I say, "He's a late bloomer,

1645
01:31:27.905 --> 01:31:31.950
"but maybe I think
you'll need to replace me."

1646
01:31:32.951 --> 01:31:34.286
You say,

1647
01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:37.206
"What? Why? How? I can't."

1648
01:31:38.874 --> 01:31:42.961
I say, "Maybe I think you'll need to try.

1649
01:31:45.756 --> 01:31:47.508
"I'm not coming back, Augie."

1650
01:31:50.636 --> 01:31:53.347
Then you take a picture of me
and start crying,

1651
01:31:54.264 --> 01:31:55.766
and I say...

1652
01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:00.646
"I hope it comes out."

1653
01:32:04.274 --> 01:32:05.567
And I say,

1654
01:32:06.527 --> 01:32:08.153
"All my pictures come out."

1655
01:32:20.123 --> 01:32:21.416
Hmm.

1656
01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:23.710
Good memory. Why'd they cut it?

1657
01:32:23.836 --> 01:32:25.254
Running time.

1658
01:32:25.337 --> 01:32:26.964
Now I'm
First Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen Consort

1659
01:32:27.089 --> 01:32:28.507
in Fruit of a Withering Vine.

1660
01:32:28.882 --> 01:32:30.133
You missed your cue.

1661
01:32:30.217 --> 01:32:32.386
June and the cowboy
are already necking in the station wagon.

1662
01:32:32.511 --> 01:32:34.847
They're bandaging
the understudy's hand right now.

1663
01:32:36.682 --> 01:32:38.433
Oh. It's you.

1664
01:32:38.559 --> 01:32:40.185
We almost would've had a scene together.

1665
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:42.312
-Hello.
-Hello.

1666
01:32:45.274 --> 01:32:48.402
Six months into the run,
the company received the news,

1667
01:32:48.527 --> 01:32:51.071
a catastrophic automobile accident.

1668
01:32:51.196 --> 01:32:55.868
Conrad Earp, American playwright
unequaled in passion and imagination,

1669
01:32:56.243 --> 01:32:57.619
dead at 50.

1670
01:32:57.744 --> 01:32:59.788
I'd like to make
a scene where all my characters

1671
01:32:59.913 --> 01:33:01.498
are each gently, privately seduced

1672
01:33:01.623 --> 01:33:03.709
into the deepest,
dreamiest slumber of their lives

1673
01:33:03.834 --> 01:33:05.502
as a result of their shared experience

1674
01:33:05.627 --> 01:33:08.338
of a bewildering
and bedazzling celestial mystery,

1675
01:33:08.463 --> 01:33:10.674
but I don't know how to write it.

1676
01:33:12.467 --> 01:33:14.595
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1677
01:33:14.678 --> 01:33:15.804
What was that?

1678
01:33:15.929 --> 01:33:17.347
What's happening?

1679
01:33:18.515 --> 01:33:20.142
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1680
01:33:20.267 --> 01:33:21.310
- What?
- That's not true.

1681
01:33:21.435 --> 01:33:22.728
- Say it again.
- Who cares?

1682
01:33:23.437 --> 01:33:25.439
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1683
01:33:25.564 --> 01:33:26.565
-Why should you?
-Maybe not.

1684
01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:27.941
-Of course.
-Uh, yes.

1685
01:33:28.108 --> 01:33:30.152
-You can't wake up...
-If you don't fall asleep.

1686
01:33:30.277 --> 01:33:32.487
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1687
01:33:32.613 --> 01:33:34.489
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1688
01:33:34.781 --> 01:33:36.783
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1689
01:33:36.867 --> 01:33:39.161
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1690
01:33:39.286 --> 01:33:41.538
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1691
01:33:41.663 --> 01:33:43.832
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1692
01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:46.210
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1693
01:33:46.335 --> 01:33:48.587
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1694
01:33:48.712 --> 01:33:51.006
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1695
01:33:51.131 --> 01:33:53.509
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1696
01:33:53.634 --> 01:33:55.677
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1697
01:33:55.802 --> 01:33:58.096
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1698
01:33:58.222 --> 01:34:00.724
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

1699
01:34:29.294 --> 01:34:32.881
Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune

1700
01:34:33.006 --> 01:34:35.843
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon...

1701
01:34:36.218 --> 01:34:38.804
Uh, where'd they go?

1702
01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:41.390
Good morning, Mr. Steenbeck.

1703
01:34:41.473 --> 01:34:43.308
Juice preference, please.
Apple, orange, or tomato.

1704
01:34:43.433 --> 01:34:45.143
Where'd they go? Everybody.

1705
01:34:45.269 --> 01:34:46.728
Of course. I understand.

1706
01:34:47.145 --> 01:34:49.731
The president lifted
the quarantine after all, at midnight.

1707
01:34:49.815 --> 01:34:52.067
He sent the whole gang home,
the troops, the cowboys,

1708
01:34:52.192 --> 01:34:53.819
the Junior Stargazers, and Space Cadets.

1709
01:34:54.111 --> 01:34:56.405
You are free to return
back to wherever you came from.

1710
01:34:56.488 --> 01:34:58.031
We had 11 checkouts this morning.

1711
01:34:58.448 --> 01:34:59.700
I guess you overslept.

1712
01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:01.827
{\an8}They returned your
science projects, by the way.

1713
01:35:01.952 --> 01:35:03.203
Hmm.

1714
01:35:04.788 --> 01:35:06.415
-Tomato.
-Right away.

1715
01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:16.925
The plan was
to shovel it up and take her with us.

1716
01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:19.970
Like I said, we'll exhume the Tupperware.

1717
01:35:20.053 --> 01:35:23.223
We don't have
any burial rights to this plot here.

1718
01:35:23.307 --> 01:35:25.058
I would question
whether it even is a plot.

1719
01:35:25.142 --> 01:35:26.310
It isn't.

1720
01:35:26.393 --> 01:35:28.395
- Don't murder my mother's ashes!
- He's killing her!

1721
01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:31.106
No, no, no, no. Let us pray.

1722
01:35:35.194 --> 01:35:36.653
Poppy!

1723
01:35:38.363 --> 01:35:40.949
Dear Heavenly Father,
we thank thee for the life

1724
01:35:41.074 --> 01:35:44.745
of this magnificent woman,
who was once just a little girl

1725
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:47.414
like these three witches in training.

1726
01:35:47.539 --> 01:35:48.957
-Not in training.
-We are witches.

1727
01:35:49.082 --> 01:35:50.626
Part witch, part alien.

1728
01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:53.045
Like these three witches at one time.

1729
01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:55.923
We had no intention
of permanently burying her

1730
01:35:56.048 --> 01:35:57.925
next to this unmarked cactus,

1731
01:35:58.050 --> 01:35:59.510
but I no longer have the strength

1732
01:35:59.635 --> 01:36:02.554
to fight for her dignity,
nor neither does Augie.

1733
01:36:02.638 --> 01:36:04.348
-Do you?
-No.

1734
01:36:04.473 --> 01:36:07.309
So we'll defer to the wishes
of her stubborn daughters.

1735
01:36:07.601 --> 01:36:09.770
Woodrow, any final farewell?

1736
01:36:11.063 --> 01:36:12.606
I don't believe in God anymore.

1737
01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:14.107
Fair enough.

1738
01:36:14.691 --> 01:36:16.777
- Amen.
- Amen.

1739
01:36:17.319 --> 01:36:19.821
Friskity, triskity, briskity, boo,

1740
01:36:19.988 --> 01:36:22.991
knickerty, knockerty, tockerty, too.

1741
01:36:23.116 --> 01:36:25.244
Mama is in the ground.

1742
01:36:25.369 --> 01:36:27.621
Say the prayer for Mama.

1743
01:36:27.746 --> 01:36:30.165
Mama, we'll say the prayer, too.

1744
01:36:30.791 --> 01:36:31.834
You are beautiful...

1745
01:36:33.001 --> 01:36:35.170
Five orders
of flapjacks and two black coffees.

1746
01:36:35.295 --> 01:36:37.130
Thanks.

1747
01:36:39.925 --> 01:36:41.343
Who needs to pee?

1748
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:45.055
How about a glass
of strawberry milk?

1749
01:36:45.138 --> 01:36:46.515
- Mmm.
- Yes, please.

1750
01:36:48.475 --> 01:36:50.936
Somebody win that scholarship?

1751
01:36:51.019 --> 01:36:52.271
I did.

1752
01:36:53.146 --> 01:36:54.857
-When?
-Last night.

1753
01:36:55.315 --> 01:36:57.609
General Gibson slipped it
to me in line at the communal showers.

1754
01:36:57.734 --> 01:36:59.695
I think he just wanted
to get it over with.

1755
01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:01.947
It's actually a standard-sized check
of typical dimensions.

1756
01:37:02.072 --> 01:37:03.824
The big one's only for show.

1757
01:37:04.408 --> 01:37:05.951
-Wow.
-Congratulations, Woodrow.

1758
01:37:06.076 --> 01:37:07.369
That's, uh, stupendous.

1759
01:37:07.494 --> 01:37:08.704
You must be some kind of a genius.

1760
01:37:08.787 --> 01:37:09.788
I agree.

1761
01:37:09.872 --> 01:37:12.499
You must be some kind of brainiac.

1762
01:37:14.084 --> 01:37:15.752
Has it got any strings attached to it?

1763
01:37:15.836 --> 01:37:17.045
It's made out to you personally.

1764
01:37:17.171 --> 01:37:18.589
How do you plan to use it?

1765
01:37:20.549 --> 01:37:22.467
I'll probably spend it on my girlfriend.

1766
01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:28.849
What do you write in that little book?

1767
01:37:30.851 --> 01:37:32.519
Next year's project, confidentially.

1768
01:37:32.644 --> 01:37:34.563
-Gee, whiz. Look at that. Whoa.
-Wow. Is that possible?

1769
01:37:34.688 --> 01:37:36.523
Is that possible?

1770
01:37:36.648 --> 01:37:38.984
Midge Campbell
left you her address.

1771
01:37:40.152 --> 01:37:42.029
It's just a post office box.

1772
01:37:44.907 --> 01:37:46.408
What happened
that night I saw the...

1773
01:37:46.533 --> 01:37:47.826
That's none of your business, Stanley.

1774
01:37:47.951 --> 01:37:49.620
I know. Of course it isn't.

1775
01:37:49.745 --> 01:37:51.246
I only ask because Woodrow told me

1776
01:37:51.371 --> 01:37:52.873
-Dinah told him.
-I understand. I understand.

1777
01:37:52.998 --> 01:37:54.499
I understand.

1778
01:37:54.625 --> 01:37:56.793
I went to law school
with her former agent.

1779
01:37:57.211 --> 01:37:58.545
Anyway, I don't object.

1780
01:37:59.463 --> 01:38:01.673
She's actually a very gifted comedienne.

1781
01:38:02.758 --> 01:38:03.759
That's true.

1782
01:38:07.721 --> 01:38:09.556
Another atom bomb test.

1783
01:38:32.746 --> 01:38:34.706
Freight train, freight train

1784
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:36.583
Going so fast

1785
01:38:36.708 --> 01:38:38.544
Freight train, freight train

1786
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:40.462
Going so fast

1787
01:38:40.712 --> 01:38:43.298
I don't know what train he's on

1788
01:38:43.423 --> 01:38:46.093
- Won't you tell me where he's gone?

1789
01:38:46.176 --> 01:38:47.761
Woodrow, let's go.

1790
01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:57.020
Don't know where

1791
01:38:57.145 --> 01:38:59.273
- He's heading for

1792
01:38:59.398 --> 01:39:00.899
What he's done

1793
01:39:01.024 --> 01:39:03.151
- Against the law

1794
01:39:03.277 --> 01:39:06.321
Got no future, got no hope

1795
01:39:06.446 --> 01:39:10.075
Just nothing but the rope

1796
01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:19.960
Freight train, freight train

1797
01:39:20.085 --> 01:39:21.795
Going so fast

1798
01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.922
Freight train, freight train

1799
01:39:24.047 --> 01:39:25.757
Going so fast

1800
01:39:25.883 --> 01:39:28.760
I don't know what train he's on

1801
01:39:28.844 --> 01:39:30.470
Won't you tell me

1802
01:39:30.596 --> 01:39:32.639
Where he's gone

1803
01:39:41.064 --> 01:39:44.484
He lost his reason
Lost his life

1804
01:39:45.068 --> 01:39:48.238
He killed his friend in mortal strife

1805
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:51.825
He must keep moving like the rolling skies

1806
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:55.954
Just a-waitin' till he dies

1807
01:40:03.879 --> 01:40:05.672
Freight train, freight train

1808
01:40:05.797 --> 01:40:07.549
Going so fast

1809
01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:09.468
Freight train, freight train

1810
01:40:09.593 --> 01:40:11.428
Going so fast

1811
01:40:11.553 --> 01:40:14.556
I don't know what train he's on

1812
01:40:14.681 --> 01:40:18.602
Won't you tell me where he's gone

1813
01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:30.697
When he dies just bury him, please

1814
01:40:30.822 --> 01:40:34.535
Way down the end of old Chestnut Street

1815
01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:37.829
Poplars at his head and feet

1816
01:40:37.955 --> 01:40:42.042
And tell them he's gone to sleep

1817
01:40:49.758 --> 01:40:51.635
Freight train, freight train

1818
01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.428
Going so fast

1819
01:40:53.554 --> 01:40:55.430
Freight train, freight train

1820
01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:57.432
Going so fast

1821
01:40:57.558 --> 01:41:00.519
I don't know what train he's on

1822
01:41:00.644 --> 01:41:04.356
Won't you tell me where he's gone

1823
01:41:40.976 --> 01:41:43.562
You

1824
01:41:47.316 --> 01:41:49.902
Can't wake up

1825
01:41:50.819 --> 01:41:53.614
If you don't fall asleep

1826
01:41:54.573 --> 01:41:57.242
You can't fall in love

1827
01:41:58.118 --> 01:42:01.705
And land on your feet

1828
01:42:01.955 --> 01:42:05.125
You won't smell the roses

1829
01:42:05.626 --> 01:42:08.504
If you never plant a seed

1830
01:42:09.338 --> 01:42:12.216
And you can't wake up

1831
01:42:12.341 --> 01:42:16.470
If you don't fall asleep

1832
01:42:20.516 --> 01:42:23.185
You can't make an entrance

1833
01:42:24.353 --> 01:42:26.438
If you keep missing your cue

1834
01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:30.734
And you won't pick a winner

1835
01:42:31.026 --> 01:42:34.321
Till you learn how to choose

1836
01:42:35.822 --> 01:42:38.492
You'll never find the treasure

1837
01:42:39.076 --> 01:42:41.537
Unless you dig deep

1838
01:42:42.412 --> 01:42:45.123
And you can't wake up

1839
01:42:45.791 --> 01:42:49.169
If you don't fall asleep

1840
01:42:53.131 --> 01:42:56.426
Oh, you'll never

1841
01:42:56.802 --> 01:42:59.304
Have memories

1842
01:43:00.514 --> 01:43:03.141
Worth keeping

1843
01:43:06.645 --> 01:43:10.983
Oh, you'll never

1844
01:43:11.316 --> 01:43:13.485
Find the truth

1845
01:43:14.611 --> 01:43:17.990
You are seeking

1846
01:43:25.038 --> 01:43:28.417
While you are sleeping

1847
01:43:33.088 --> 01:43:37.050
But you can't wake up

1848
01:43:37.301 --> 01:43:40.387
If you don't fall asleep

1849
01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:44.725
So go live your dreams

1850
01:43:45.184 --> 01:43:47.603
And live them real deep

1851
01:43:47.728 --> 01:43:51.523
There is some counting money

1852
01:43:52.524 --> 01:43:56.403
And there's some counting sheep

1853
01:43:57.779 --> 01:44:01.575
Oh, you can't wake up

1854
01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:08.040
If you don't fall asleep

1855
01:44:13.086 --> 01:44:16.256
If you don't fall asleep
