WEBVTT

00:12.391 --> 00:16.399
<i>Previously on</i> Class of '09...

00:16.399 --> 00:17.703
<i>Out here, we shake
each other's hands.</i>

00:17.703 --> 00:20.542
Well, I'm not here
to buy a cow, sir.

00:26.419 --> 00:27.756
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

00:27.756 --> 00:29.827
<i>They revealed themselves.</i>

00:29.827 --> 00:32.599
Aah!

00:33.668 --> 00:34.803
Fuck you!

00:36.339 --> 00:38.578
<i>What are they planning
to attack?</i>

00:38.578 --> 00:40.480
<i>Us.</i>

00:41.249 --> 00:44.188
I get to see the expression
on your face

00:44.188 --> 00:46.527
when you hear the news.

00:46.527 --> 00:48.831
There are inexplicable arrests.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.267
You know it, I know it.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.171
No, Senator, I don't know it.

00:52.171 --> 00:55.344
Special Agent Poet,
you've been lied to.

00:55.344 --> 00:58.283
This system is making
connections on its own.

00:58.283 --> 01:00.353
This is an intelligence
nothing like our own.

01:58.269 --> 02:00.474
Suspect is entering
the apartment.

02:00.474 --> 02:01.843
<i>Copy.</i>

02:12.932 --> 02:15.404
Suspect is alone.
No sign of his girlfriend.

02:15.404 --> 02:16.907
<i>Copy.</i>

02:16.907 --> 02:18.544
<i>Moving in.</i>

02:22.919 --> 02:23.888
FBI. Open up.

02:23.888 --> 02:25.558
Open up!

02:27.361 --> 02:28.397
Hands up!

02:28.397 --> 02:29.600
Get down!

02:29.600 --> 02:30.801
Gun! Stay on him!

02:33.641 --> 02:35.644
We should stay in the van.

02:41.523 --> 02:42.926
- Get off me.
- Get him, let's go.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.919
Hold him down.

02:58.489 --> 03:01.696
FBI! Stop right there!

03:08.911 --> 03:11.684
Oh, shit. Drew. Drew.

03:11.684 --> 03:13.253
She was supposed to stay
in the van.

03:13.253 --> 03:14.723
Why was she there?

03:14.723 --> 03:17.629
- What the hell was she doing?
- Hang in there.

03:17.629 --> 03:19.600
This was my weapon as an agent.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.239
A SIG Sauer p228.

03:25.043 --> 03:26.947
Did you ever fire it, ma'am?

03:26.947 --> 03:29.452
On duty, I mean.

03:29.452 --> 03:32.658
No, I never did.

03:34.930 --> 03:36.867
The Bureau's first
official weapon.

03:36.867 --> 03:40.340
A four-inch barreled
Colt Police revolver.

03:40.340 --> 03:43.046
Issued to the class of 1934
at graduation.

03:43.046 --> 03:46.787
Today the primary weapon
we use is the Glock 23.

03:46.787 --> 03:49.458
This one is called
the red handle

03:49.458 --> 03:51.462
because the barrel
has been blocked

03:51.462 --> 03:53.333
and the firing pin removed.

03:53.333 --> 03:56.306
During your training, you will
carry these around the base.

03:56.306 --> 03:58.443
We want you to get accustomed
to the weight of them.

03:58.443 --> 04:02.752
The feel of them.
The idea of them.

04:02.752 --> 04:03.955
The idea of them, ma'am?

04:03.955 --> 04:06.660
What it means to take a life.

04:06.660 --> 04:09.566
What it means to risk your life.

04:09.566 --> 04:12.539
A special agent
doesn't draw their gun

04:12.539 --> 04:14.710
unless they intend to fire.

04:14.710 --> 04:17.782
If you decide that you
cannot take a life,

04:17.782 --> 04:19.017
you cannot be a special agent.

04:21.489 --> 04:24.730
When you receive your weapon,
I'd like you to tell the class

04:24.730 --> 04:27.702
about your own experiences
with firearms.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.488
You know your way around a gun.

04:55.925 --> 04:58.631
I spent most of my adult life
in a shooting range, sir.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.702
What's the story of this range?

05:00.702 --> 05:03.373
Chicago Gun Academy, sir.

05:03.373 --> 05:05.778
Ran by a lovely
Vietnamese couple.

05:05.778 --> 05:07.716
The people going there weren't
dreaming of shooting anybody,

05:07.716 --> 05:09.418
they just didn't
want to be shot.

05:17.635 --> 05:20.775
This is the first time
I've ever held a gun.

05:20.775 --> 05:22.010
<i>HOUR'S MOTHER:
When did you apply?</i>

05:23.446 --> 05:26.085
Six months ago.

05:26.085 --> 05:27.622
There wasn't
any point in telling you

05:27.622 --> 05:29.926
if I wasn't going
to be accepted.

05:31.997 --> 05:36.072
You didn't tell us because
you knew we'd say no.

05:36.072 --> 05:38.711
Why tell us now?

05:38.711 --> 05:41.015
The next stage is the polygraph.

05:41.015 --> 05:43.521
So if I hadn't told you...

05:43.521 --> 05:46.426
maybe it would show up
in my answers.

05:46.426 --> 05:48.731
Hour. What are you doing?

05:48.731 --> 05:51.770
You have a degree from MIT.

05:51.770 --> 05:53.674
They like that about me.

05:53.674 --> 05:56.045
Because nobody else would waste
their education in this way.

05:56.045 --> 05:59.485
This is not a world
you know anything about.

05:59.485 --> 06:02.759
We take the Metro to work so
we won't be stopped in our car.

06:02.759 --> 06:04.529
We take the car on vacation

06:04.529 --> 06:06.533
so we won't be stopped
at the airports.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.938
I don't want to live that way.

06:08.938 --> 06:10.173
I want to feel part
of something.

06:10.173 --> 06:11.610
And this is what you choose?

06:13.446 --> 06:14.750
They want me, Dad.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.421
But why do you want them?

06:17.421 --> 06:18.791
What will they have you do?

06:18.791 --> 06:20.494
Spy on your own people?

06:20.494 --> 06:22.632
Baba, this isn't
the secret police.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.772
They must have carried out a
background check on our family.

06:25.772 --> 06:28.009
You've brought them
into our lives.

06:28.009 --> 06:29.646
We have nothing to hide.

06:29.646 --> 06:31.717
That doesn't matter.

06:31.717 --> 06:33.654
That has never mattered.

06:39.231 --> 06:42.137
Are you angry with us?

06:42.137 --> 06:45.043
Is this about... something else?

06:45.043 --> 06:46.212
What might it be about, Mom?

06:46.212 --> 06:51.189
You were... a lonely child.

06:51.189 --> 06:53.627
Perhaps you're lonely still.

06:53.627 --> 06:55.864
Maybe I'll always be lonely.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.138
There are other ways to feel
a part of this country.

06:59.138 --> 07:03.446
And other ways to feel
different from us.

07:05.785 --> 07:09.625
Was it too much to hope
that you'd be proud of me?

07:30.266 --> 07:32.905
Would you lift
your arms, please?

07:34.709 --> 07:37.948
- I can do that.
- No, it has to be me.

07:43.861 --> 07:45.898
Will you lay
your hands flat, please?

07:46.700 --> 07:49.271
Could you explain
what you're doing?

07:49.271 --> 07:51.577
Nobody ever asks that.

07:51.577 --> 07:54.883
There's a sensor in the chair
that detects movement.

07:54.883 --> 07:56.954
These are pneumography tubes,

07:56.954 --> 07:58.657
measure your rate
of respiration.

07:58.657 --> 08:00.828
These measure
electrodermal activity.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.599
That's for your blood pressure.

08:02.599 --> 08:04.836
The test will take
approximately two hours.

08:04.836 --> 08:08.176
And if your answers
are unresponsive,

08:08.176 --> 08:10.013
it can take up to four.

08:10.013 --> 08:12.585
You have to limit your answers
to yes or no.

08:12.585 --> 08:13.988
You can stop
the test at any time,

08:13.988 --> 08:16.092
but to do so
would constitute a fail.

08:16.092 --> 08:17.796
And you have the right
to an attorney,

08:17.796 --> 08:18.898
but to call for one would...

08:18.898 --> 08:20.200
Constitute a fail.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.070
Mm.

08:23.172 --> 08:24.976
It's normal to be nervous.

08:24.976 --> 08:27.748
I'm not nervous. I'm curious.

08:32.090 --> 08:34.228
Who interprets the responses?

08:34.228 --> 08:35.297
I do.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.267
How many tests have you done?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.605
Oh, hundreds.

08:41.810 --> 08:44.916
There are 50,000 applicants
to the Bureau each year.

08:44.916 --> 08:48.624
The government must have carried
out millions of these tests.

08:48.624 --> 08:50.026
Over the years.

08:50.026 --> 08:53.133
Do you... collect the data?

08:53.133 --> 08:56.840
We keep 'em on file.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.611
But is it on
a centralized database?

08:58.611 --> 08:59.679
No.

09:01.683 --> 09:04.288
Doesn't it make sense
to cross-reference them

09:04.288 --> 09:06.760
rather than rely on
one person's interpretation?

09:08.362 --> 09:10.200
There was the case
of Wen Ho Lee.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.037
Nuclear scientist at Los Alamos

09:12.037 --> 09:13.239
accused of being a Chinese spy?

09:13.239 --> 09:14.275
I know the case.

09:14.275 --> 09:16.112
He passed the DOE polygraph.

09:16.112 --> 09:18.818
But the FBI reexamined
the same results

09:18.818 --> 09:20.755
and they decided he was lying.

09:20.755 --> 09:22.057
That he had slipped
China secrets

09:22.057 --> 09:25.297
about the miniaturized
W88 warhead.

09:25.297 --> 09:28.704
Maybe if you collated all
the data on a central database,

09:28.704 --> 09:30.006
it wouldn't be so subjective.

09:31.242 --> 09:32.711
Hmm.

09:33.914 --> 09:38.089
You know, some people
want to fail a test.

09:38.089 --> 09:40.260
They deliberately
flunk it in a way

09:40.260 --> 09:42.866
to drop out of the process
without losing face.

09:42.866 --> 09:45.804
If that's you, just say so.

09:49.044 --> 09:50.614
Can we begin?

10:41.415 --> 10:44.822
Excuse me for not
shaking your hand.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.894
Marine once told me...

11:03.894 --> 11:07.100
I'm sorry, this Marine,
is he a friend of yours, or...?

11:09.004 --> 11:11.977
Friend. Close friend.

11:11.977 --> 11:14.315
Patriot.

11:14.315 --> 11:16.887
He said after a man kills
for the first time,

11:16.887 --> 11:19.124
the smell of his skin changes.

11:20.493 --> 11:22.464
Your wife.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.902
Was she the first person
you've killed?

11:26.238 --> 11:28.944
Well, I rescued her
from squalor.

11:28.944 --> 11:31.917
I fixed her teeth, her hair.

11:31.917 --> 11:35.056
Overlooked everything
she had to do to survive.

11:35.056 --> 11:36.425
Yeah, sounds like you
overlooked quite a bit

11:36.425 --> 11:37.895
because you couldn't see
that she hated you.

11:39.932 --> 11:42.739
What about your wife?

11:42.739 --> 11:45.010
Looks like I made
killers of you both.

11:45.010 --> 11:47.047
I think it's safe to say
that we had just cause,

11:47.047 --> 11:49.184
wouldn't you?

11:49.184 --> 11:51.188
- Just cause?
- Mm-hmm.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.491
Oh.

11:52.491 --> 11:54.763
Just cause.

11:54.763 --> 11:56.332
Ah.

11:56.332 --> 11:57.367
Is that what you
were looking for

11:57.367 --> 11:58.469
out at my ranch?

11:58.469 --> 12:00.473
"Just cause."

12:00.473 --> 12:02.779
Yeah, you've been looking
for that your whole life.

12:02.779 --> 12:07.054
And you got your badge
and your gun.

12:07.054 --> 12:11.796
All you needed was that "just
cause" to get away with it.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.339
"To get away with it," yeah.

12:17.976 --> 12:21.082
Let's talk about that,
"getting away with it."

12:21.082 --> 12:22.384
Because getting away with it,

12:22.384 --> 12:25.490
I would've just strolled
on your ranch.

12:25.490 --> 12:27.427
And I would've shot you
right between the eyes.

12:28.229 --> 12:30.100
And maybe I should've
because then...

12:30.100 --> 12:31.803
your wife would still be alive.

12:31.803 --> 12:33.272
My partner wouldn't be lying
in a hospital bed.

12:33.272 --> 12:35.845
And my wife wouldn't
have been attacked.

12:35.845 --> 12:38.116
But I didn't.

12:38.116 --> 12:40.387
No, no, no, I didn't.

12:43.359 --> 12:47.300
You're the highest ranking
FBI agent in Montana.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.471
What you doing
on a routine piece of fieldwork

12:49.471 --> 12:51.809
if not hunting
for folks like me?

12:53.112 --> 12:55.518
Yeah, you've been dreaming
of that day for years.

12:58.557 --> 13:00.226
Let's...

13:00.226 --> 13:03.534
Let's be very clear
about something.

13:03.534 --> 13:09.110
You may be many things,
but you are no dream of mine.

13:10.313 --> 13:11.382
<i>Have we figured out</i>

13:11.382 --> 13:12.552
where they were driving to

13:12.552 --> 13:14.254
when they were caught?

13:14.254 --> 13:16.291
We can't make sense
of their route.

13:18.930 --> 13:21.268
Is it possible
that they were a diversion?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.472
A diversion from what?

13:36.198 --> 13:38.336
Nice job, Hour.
You're a natural.

13:38.336 --> 13:39.572
Tayo, you're up.

13:39.572 --> 13:41.375
Nice job.

13:43.012 --> 13:45.049
Shooter, stand by.

14:02.150 --> 14:04.287
Nice shooting, trainee.

14:13.974 --> 14:15.076
Shooter, stand by.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.138
Why did you freeze, trainee?

14:46.138 --> 14:48.977
Ma'am, I didn't freeze.

14:48.977 --> 14:50.413
You didn't fire.

14:50.413 --> 14:51.950
I didn't consider her
to be a threat.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.620
Why not? She's armed.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.192
But who is she? She's a woman,

14:56.192 --> 14:57.327
she looks like a professional,

14:57.327 --> 14:59.599
my guess would be
law enforcement.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.402
She's not holding a Glock.

15:01.402 --> 15:02.638
Smith & Wesson 640.

15:02.638 --> 15:04.676
Approved
for off-duty police officers.

15:04.676 --> 15:06.546
So you decided
in that split second

15:06.546 --> 15:08.282
she was an off-duty detective?

15:08.282 --> 15:10.554
Well, they also use those guns
for personal protection.

15:10.554 --> 15:12.491
She could be escaping
a violent partner.

15:12.491 --> 15:15.463
The test wasn't
to write her biography.

15:16.766 --> 15:18.436
But don't we have to,

15:18.436 --> 15:20.406
if we're gonna take her life?

15:31.663 --> 15:35.303
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:35.303 --> 15:37.975
I was proud of you back there.

15:37.975 --> 15:39.211
You were proud?

15:39.211 --> 15:41.650
Oh, I said the wrong word,
didn't I?

15:41.650 --> 15:43.319
No.

15:43.319 --> 15:44.622
Well, whatever the, uh,
the right word is,

15:44.622 --> 15:47.260
that is how I felt.

15:47.260 --> 15:50.734
Isn't it up to you to decide
what the right word is?

15:50.734 --> 15:52.404
You're a hard person
to compliment.

15:52.404 --> 15:53.640
And an easy one to offend?

15:53.640 --> 15:56.312
I didn't say that.

15:56.312 --> 15:58.717
Where'd you learn how to shoot?

15:58.717 --> 16:00.186
My mom.

16:00.186 --> 16:02.390
Tin cans in the backyard.

16:02.390 --> 16:04.494
She believed any woman
who lived alone

16:04.494 --> 16:06.666
should know how to shoot.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.570
- You?
- My dad.

16:08.570 --> 16:10.740
Hunting deer.

16:25.671 --> 16:27.708
What am I doing?

16:28.610 --> 16:32.350
I'm supposed to be working,
not going on dates.

16:32.350 --> 16:33.687
He's a distraction.

16:33.687 --> 16:35.223
Falling in love
is not a distraction.

16:35.223 --> 16:36.692
I'm not in love.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.638
I mean, these next five months
decide the rest of our lives.

16:42.638 --> 16:45.076
Any five months decide
the rest of our lives.

16:45.076 --> 16:47.046
Well, some months are
more important than others.

16:49.184 --> 16:52.324
I had friends
in high school who...

16:52.324 --> 16:54.729
messed around and now they have
all the time in the world,

16:54.729 --> 16:57.334
but they can't change
their lives.

16:57.334 --> 16:59.338
I know these feelings.

16:59.338 --> 17:02.077
It's guilt.

17:02.077 --> 17:04.616
I felt the same way
when I'd fall for someone.

17:04.616 --> 17:07.688
I haven't fallen for him,
I just... I like him.

17:07.688 --> 17:09.758
For me the guilt is...

17:12.463 --> 17:14.434
...because I'm not married.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.608
For you it's work ethic.

17:21.448 --> 17:23.285
Yeah.

17:24.622 --> 17:26.526
My mom never dated anyone.

17:26.526 --> 17:29.298
When my dad... walked out,

17:29.298 --> 17:32.270
she promised me she'd never
bring a boyfriend home.

17:32.270 --> 17:36.312
I never had a father, so she
was gonna make up for that.

17:36.312 --> 17:39.151
But when I got older,
you know, and...

17:39.151 --> 17:40.587
and realized
what this was costing her,

17:40.587 --> 17:43.760
I-I should have said...

17:43.760 --> 17:46.800
"It's fine, you can date.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.172
You don't have to be alone."

17:52.611 --> 17:54.848
Maybe if I had...

17:55.817 --> 17:59.458
It's fine. You can date.

17:59.458 --> 18:01.662
You don't have to be alone.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.563
Can you come with me, please?

18:18.563 --> 18:20.466
Yes, ma'am.

18:39.270 --> 18:40.406
At this point in the training,

18:40.406 --> 18:42.277
we repeat your polygraph test

18:42.277 --> 18:45.149
and compare your responses.

18:46.886 --> 18:48.890
Only me?

18:48.890 --> 18:51.395
Why would it only be you?

18:51.395 --> 18:53.933
Right.

19:31.709 --> 19:33.446
Try to relax.

19:33.446 --> 19:34.948
I'd hate to fail you
because you couldn't relax.

19:42.029 --> 19:44.000
Have you ever taken
any illegal narcotics?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.404
Yes.

19:49.277 --> 19:50.547
You listed on your application

19:50.547 --> 19:52.283
the occasions
you smoked marijuana.

19:52.283 --> 19:53.687
Are these still
the only occasions?

19:53.687 --> 19:54.788
Yes.

19:56.759 --> 19:58.796
Were they after sex?

20:00.934 --> 20:02.236
No.

20:03.038 --> 20:07.347
Was your mother ever addicted
to prescription medication?

20:07.347 --> 20:09.217
Yes.

20:10.319 --> 20:14.562
Have <i>you</i> ever been addicted
to prescription medication?

20:14.562 --> 20:16.565
No.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.572
You concealed anything
during this process

20:19.572 --> 20:22.844
which might negatively influence
your application?

20:28.723 --> 20:30.560
Yes.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.332
Your previous answer was no.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.002
You're changing
your answer to yes?

20:35.002 --> 20:36.972
Yes.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.547
Did you lie before?

20:40.547 --> 20:41.949
No.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.824
This is something new?

20:47.426 --> 20:49.330
Yes.

20:51.468 --> 20:53.807
For the next question,
I'm going to release you

20:53.807 --> 20:56.880
of the obligation
saying yes or no.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.751
What have you concealed?

21:11.041 --> 21:13.780
Have you retaken the polygraph?

21:13.780 --> 21:15.651
Last week.

21:15.651 --> 21:17.655
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?

21:17.655 --> 21:18.990
The same.

21:21.127 --> 21:23.431
You didn't say something to me?

21:24.935 --> 21:27.407
What's to say?

21:27.407 --> 21:29.845
Did you tell them about us?

21:29.845 --> 21:31.749
About us? No.

21:31.749 --> 21:32.851
Did you?

21:34.722 --> 21:36.124
I mean...

21:36.124 --> 21:37.828
they asked me
if I was concealing anything.

21:37.828 --> 21:39.497
They weren't talking about us.

21:39.497 --> 21:41.001
How do you know?
This is against the rules.

21:41.001 --> 21:42.805
What rules?

21:42.805 --> 21:45.443
The agent trainee rules.

21:45.443 --> 21:46.746
You actually read those?

21:46.746 --> 21:48.382
Come on.

21:48.382 --> 21:49.785
This is important.

21:49.785 --> 21:52.691
This isn't high school.

21:52.691 --> 21:54.762
So you don't think we need
to let Gabriel and Drew know?

21:54.762 --> 21:56.966
It's none of their business.

21:56.966 --> 21:58.603
Everything is their business.

21:58.603 --> 22:00.874
Not us.

22:11.862 --> 22:13.800
Mind if I walk with you?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.637
Oh, of course not.

22:15.637 --> 22:18.677
I wanted to talk
about your polygraph.

22:18.677 --> 22:19.978
Oh, did I fail?

22:20.780 --> 22:24.721
Look, I'm not speaking
as your supervisor right now.

22:25.991 --> 22:27.427
Okay.

22:27.427 --> 22:28.997
Ever since women
were allowed to join,

22:28.997 --> 22:31.936
there have been hookups
and couples.

22:31.936 --> 22:34.642
Some even end up
getting married.

22:34.642 --> 22:36.110
Most don't.

22:37.781 --> 22:40.019
I'm not trying to embarrass you.

22:40.019 --> 22:42.924
I just wanted you to be aware
of the reality of our situation.

22:44.695 --> 22:46.064
Which is...?

22:46.064 --> 22:47.166
If it doesn't work out,

22:47.166 --> 22:49.471
the woman always
comes off worse.

22:49.471 --> 22:51.943
She always takes the hit.

22:51.943 --> 22:53.680
It shouldn't be that way.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.449
But it is.

22:55.449 --> 22:58.523
And I'm not telling you
to do anything differently.

22:58.523 --> 23:01.128
I'm telling you the way it is.

23:01.128 --> 23:02.597
I appreciate that.

23:03.398 --> 23:06.739
I was in an incident
at the beginning of my career,

23:06.739 --> 23:08.743
for which I was blamed.

23:10.079 --> 23:12.416
It was
an agent-on-agent shooting.

23:13.686 --> 23:14.989
- You shot an agent?
- No.

23:14.989 --> 23:16.491
I was the one who was shot.

23:17.894 --> 23:18.863
You said you were blamed?

23:18.863 --> 23:21.168
I was.

23:21.168 --> 23:22.705
One of the reasons they gave

23:22.705 --> 23:24.909
was they said
I was in the wrong place.

23:24.909 --> 23:28.482
And I was in the same place
as the guys.

23:28.482 --> 23:29.952
I'm so sorry.

23:29.952 --> 23:33.927
Ah, I'd be dead if they
weren't such lousy shots.

23:37.534 --> 23:39.739
Why did you stay in the Bureau?

23:39.739 --> 23:41.909
I couldn't let 'em win.

23:41.909 --> 23:43.747
I was one of the best trainees
my year.

23:43.747 --> 23:47.554
So, when I recovered, I just
came back to the classroom.

23:47.554 --> 23:49.792
'Cause... that's the only place

23:49.792 --> 23:52.831
I was ever allowed to be great.

24:28.703 --> 24:31.742
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:35.583 --> 24:37.119
Can I come in?

24:44.601 --> 24:46.572
Big house.

24:46.572 --> 24:49.645
Yeah, it's nice
when the girls stay.

24:49.645 --> 24:51.047
Hmm.

24:52.049 --> 24:54.722
How often is that?

24:54.722 --> 24:57.694
Not as often as I'd like.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.003
I'm sorry.

25:02.003 --> 25:05.008
Yeah, so am I.

25:12.958 --> 25:16.566
I leaned on my family
connections to try and see if...

25:16.566 --> 25:19.003
you know, who was an ally.

25:20.239 --> 25:22.845
A lot of people are...

25:22.845 --> 25:24.982
really worried
about this system.

25:24.982 --> 25:28.923
Uh, they think it's too big,
it's too powerful.

25:28.923 --> 25:30.126
A lot of people
will only express

25:30.126 --> 25:32.764
their concerns in private.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.773
Not a lot are willing to help.

25:36.773 --> 25:38.743
No surprise there, right?

25:38.743 --> 25:40.212
No.

25:43.018 --> 25:45.623
Even talking can get
people in trouble.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.930
Some got mad at me
for approaching them

25:48.930 --> 25:51.602
face-to-face, away from cameras.

25:51.602 --> 25:53.773
Is your dad helping?

25:54.975 --> 25:57.380
He knows people
that know people,

25:57.380 --> 26:00.854
including Senator Spenser,
so I'm trying to...

26:00.854 --> 26:02.189
set up a meeting.

26:02.991 --> 26:05.963
But like I said,
people are scared.

26:11.140 --> 26:13.278
Um...

26:13.278 --> 26:15.750
I wanted to say that...

26:15.750 --> 26:18.388
you know, before this
goes too far,

26:18.388 --> 26:21.094
you don't have to be a part
of the investigation

26:21.094 --> 26:23.867
into Tayo's system for my sake.

26:23.867 --> 26:25.603
Poet, stop.

26:26.404 --> 26:28.375
You can do it on your own.
I-I get it.

26:28.375 --> 26:29.878
You...

26:30.780 --> 26:34.922
You always had it in your mind
that I preferred to be alone.

26:34.922 --> 26:37.192
Because you always are.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.302
If not me, okay.

26:43.739 --> 26:45.342
But someone.

26:52.389 --> 26:54.326
Am...

26:55.429 --> 26:56.865
Am I the problem?

26:59.203 --> 27:01.776
Every time something feels good,
you mistrust it.

27:01.776 --> 27:04.280
Like it can't be real.

27:04.280 --> 27:07.954
So you test it and you test it
until it breaks.

27:08.990 --> 27:13.298
And you say to yourself, "You
see? I was right all along."

27:15.435 --> 27:18.174
Is that why we didn't make it?

27:22.416 --> 27:25.155
Maybe everything
in my life seemed too easy.

27:26.725 --> 27:30.365
And you wouldn't be
another one of those things.

27:31.735 --> 27:34.742
But I can tell you now...

27:34.742 --> 27:37.045
loving you has not been easy.

27:38.081 --> 27:40.686
And I've loved you for 20 years.

27:47.968 --> 27:51.041
That is why you should not
be involved in this.

27:51.041 --> 27:52.911
Not this time, Poet.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.819
This time, you're gonna
have to tell me

27:56.819 --> 27:59.123
it doesn't stand a chance.

28:01.094 --> 28:03.398
This time, it's not gonna be me.

29:06.124 --> 29:10.567
Could Tupirik have people
infiltrate the Bureau?

29:10.567 --> 29:13.539
Why not?

29:13.539 --> 29:15.476
There are checks.

29:15.476 --> 29:18.516
The polygraph?

29:18.516 --> 29:21.220
I lied on mine.

29:22.524 --> 29:26.064
What'd you lie about?

29:26.064 --> 29:29.169
Only the really
important things.

29:31.575 --> 29:33.445
<i>At least a dozen manhunts</i>

29:33.445 --> 29:35.517
<i>for additional key members
of Mark Tupirik's militia</i>

29:35.517 --> 29:37.888
<i>are underway
in multiple states...</i>

29:37.888 --> 29:39.892
<i>as the Bureau attempts
to figure out the scope</i>

29:39.892 --> 29:44.100
<i>and scale
of his anti-government militia.</i>

29:44.100 --> 29:47.039
Firearms assessment is today.

30:01.334 --> 30:03.071
Welcome, sir. You got it?

30:03.071 --> 30:04.974
All right.

30:12.891 --> 30:13.959
Thanks.

30:43.218 --> 30:44.854
We go today.

30:54.106 --> 30:56.578
at the people on this screen.

31:09.638 --> 31:12.375
Oh.

31:13.646 --> 31:14.914
What are you afraid of?

31:20.091 --> 31:22.329
You think you'll be
too easy to read?

31:23.599 --> 31:25.335
By a man like me?

31:35.121 --> 31:37.259
<i>The system is picking up
elevated movements,</i>

31:37.259 --> 31:39.363
<i>pupil dilation,
heart rate increase.</i>

31:40.432 --> 31:42.470
<i>We've got one.</i>

31:47.012 --> 31:49.116
Next.

32:01.173 --> 32:03.345
I've seen this man before.

32:03.345 --> 32:06.083
Doing construction
in the garage.

32:06.952 --> 32:09.991
We think the suspect
may be at Quantico.

32:13.666 --> 32:17.573
On the signal, walk forward
while shooting at the target.

32:23.051 --> 32:24.153
Shooter! Shooter!

32:24.153 --> 32:25.623
Aah!

32:25.623 --> 32:26.958
Hey!

32:46.264 --> 32:48.201
No, please!

32:51.040 --> 32:53.044
Get out of there!

32:53.044 --> 32:54.413
We got a shooter!

33:11.648 --> 33:14.086
She's losing so much blood.

33:14.086 --> 33:15.188
You're gonna be all right.

33:16.190 --> 33:17.459
There's an alert at Quantico.

33:28.148 --> 33:29.216
Hey.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.452
<i>I need you to meet me right now.</i>

33:30.452 --> 33:31.555
Where? Here?

33:31.555 --> 33:33.158
<i>I'll take the heat if I'm wrong,</i>

33:33.158 --> 33:35.830
<i>but we need to evacuate
this building.</i>

33:46.350 --> 33:48.121
<i>AUTOMATED VOICE
Attention, attention.</i>

33:48.121 --> 33:51.094
<i>Please evacuate
this building immediately.</i>

33:51.094 --> 33:53.198
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

33:53.198 --> 33:55.737
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

33:55.737 --> 33:58.074
<i>Please evacuate
this building immediately.</i>

33:58.074 --> 33:59.076
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

34:01.782 --> 34:04.120
