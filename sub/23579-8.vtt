00:35.535 --> 00:38.830
<i>What we believe shapes who we are.</i>

00:40.790 --> 00:42.459
<i>Belief can bring us salvation...</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:45.628
<i>or destruction.</i>

00:48.381 --> 00:49.966
-Listen to me--

00:52.385 --> 00:58.641
<i>But when you believe a lie for too long, </i>
<i>the truth doesn't set you free.</i>

00:58.725 --> 00:59.851
No.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.312
<i>It tears you apart.</i>

01:02.812 --> 01:04.314
You killed her?

01:04.689 --> 01:06.024
You killed everyone?

01:08.026 --> 01:09.069
Why?

01:10.403 --> 01:12.197
Why would you do that?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.657
I was trying to save our lives.

01:17.535 --> 01:21.831
Quell and the Envoys were our family.
How could you kill our family?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.333
They were just soldiers.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.337
You and I, we're family.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.131
Our lives will be better now.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.259
When everyone I ever loved
was taken away from me?

01:33.343 --> 01:36.221
You know what that did to me?
What I became?

01:36.679 --> 01:38.223
I tried to find you.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.267
-Then you got yourself caught by CTAC.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.978
They locked you up so tight,
no one could get to you.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.730
So it took you 250 years to get me out.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.652
It would have been forever if I hadn't
played Bancroft into wanting you.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.237
Do you have any idea

01:52.320 --> 01:56.116
how hard it was to find someone
with the pull to get you off ice?

01:56.950 --> 02:02.580
You were in those sleeves,
watching... talking to me.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.457
Why didn't you say anything?

02:04.541 --> 02:08.044
Because I knew it was going to be hard
for you to trust me.

02:08.128 --> 02:12.382
That idiot Dimi was supposed
to pick you up to bring you to me to talk.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.054
After that, I waited for the right time.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.723
But when his brother
was gonna RD you, I had to act.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.517
And you're welcome.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.269
What do you want from me, Rei?

02:24.853 --> 02:30.650
Just to see me as the sister
who loves you, who'd do anything for you.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.862
You destroyed the Uprising.
How the hell was that for me?

02:33.945 --> 02:36.114
Quell was using you, using all of us.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.200
Brainwashed us all to fight
and die for nothing.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.036
The Uprising was already doomed.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.456
I was the only one
who was going to take care of us.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.916
So what did they pay you?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.920
Backups Clones?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.380
All of them.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.677
And none of it mattered
unless I could get you back.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.185
I loved her.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.562
I know.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.607
But she was going to get you killed.

03:12.191 --> 03:15.236
Kill me, if that's what you need.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.448
I'll come back for you, big brother.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.117
No matter what...

03:22.201 --> 03:24.495
I'll always come back for you.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.973
Sandy Kim, reporting live
outside the Fell Street Police Station,

03:44.057 --> 03:47.894
where BCPD
are still reeling from an attack

03:47.977 --> 03:50.271
that came from within the station.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.233
Detective Ortega,
what were you doing at Fightdrome?

03:53.316 --> 03:55.068
-Can you respond to allegations...
-Out of my way.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.403
...you are part
of a black market fighting ring?

03:57.487 --> 04:01.824
Are your underworld connections the reason
why the station was attacked?

04:04.827 --> 04:06.162
Detective Ortega?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.961
They’re lies, and you know it, bitch.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.172
Getting me fucked over
doesn't help Bancroft anymore.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.759
He knows I believe he was murdered.
So who are you really working for?

04:20.343 --> 04:21.719
And where's Kovacs?

04:22.303 --> 04:24.097
Lieutenant, really. You're being paranoid.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.181
Hmm.

04:25.265 --> 04:29.769
Sandy Kim and I,
we have a symbiotic relationship.

04:29.852 --> 04:33.606
She does me occasional favors
and, in return, I feed her what sells.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.900
Sex. Violence. Money.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.443
Corrupt cops.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.487
I can get a subpoena and make you talk.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.240
Oh, I very much doubt you can do either.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.658
Take my advice.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.412
You've come too close to dying this life.
Just... leave it alone.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.623
Haven't you lost enough?

05:21.195 --> 05:22.780
What the fuck are you looking at?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.178
Shit!

05:53.936 --> 05:55.354
What are you doing here?

05:55.438 --> 05:58.733
I couldn't just sit there
while Kovacs is missing.

05:58.816 --> 05:59.692
Remember him?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.778
Tall, bad attitude, Envoy,

06:01.861 --> 06:05.198
who for some fucking reason
has no missing person alert out on him.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.408
We can't say if he's missing, exactly.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.036
He left Fightdrome with someone.
That's all we know for sure.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.206
You look good.
I could have sworn I broke your back.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.123
You did.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.668
Bone fusion
took my whole deductible for the year.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.464
-I told IA I fell down.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.217
In my office. Now.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.937
-You need to go.
-No. You need to resign.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.022
-I need to get back to work.
-You can't.

06:38.106 --> 06:41.150
You're on paid leave while this
Fightdrome disaster goes to IA.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.235
Oh, yeah?

06:42.819 --> 06:45.029
What happens when I tell them
you're on the take?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.572
What happens? Nothing.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.117
There is no evidence, no money trail,

06:49.200 --> 06:51.577
-and no one is going to believe you--
-I'll convince them--

06:51.661 --> 06:53.204
-They won't let you!

06:54.038 --> 06:56.582
Kristin, you're gonna get yourself
real death'd.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.128
-I wanna know why Ryker was framed.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.422
I want to know who is this ghost
who killed Abboud.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.425
Who took Kovacs, where he is,
if he's even alive.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.927
I need answers.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.473
-I know that look. You want blood.
-If that's what it takes.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.020
I can't protect you anymore.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.147
Protect me?

07:21.774 --> 07:22.608
Protect me?

07:22.984 --> 07:25.903
Get your things and go.
I'll give you 15 minutes.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.739
If you're not gone by then,
I'll have you escorted out.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.411
I'm sorry, Kristin. I hope you know that.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.497
But I won't let you take me down with you.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.927
Drink this.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.054
It'll help.

07:54.932 --> 07:57.477
Say something.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.022
Anything.

08:04.442 --> 08:08.779
So, what? I just... forgive you,
like nothing's happened?

08:08.863 --> 08:11.574
I don't want forgiveness
for saving you from yourself.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.035
Not for what you did to me.
It's what you did to them.

08:14.118 --> 08:20.583
That was a long time ago.
This is our chance to start over.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.836
Let it all go, begin again,
just you and me.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.006
She taught us better than this.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.219
-I don't care about what Quell said.
-I'm talking about Mom.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.933
Tak, don't.

08:38.935 --> 08:42.313
We've got years for you to be angry
with me. Forever, potentially.

08:42.396 --> 08:45.024
Right now, I need your help.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.113
Bancroft.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.615
I need you to close the case.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.743
-Don't be ridiculous.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.370
I didn't touch Laurens.

08:57.453 --> 09:00.373
On the contrary,
I gave him what he always wanted.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.542
He was surprisingly unappreciative.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.002
Although, being high on Stallion
may have affected his judgment.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.548
No, I read the autopsy report.
There was nothing about drugs in his body.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.717
Yes. Tanaka earned his paycheck
on the postmortem paperwork.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.096
Not to mention, it was hell
getting Laurens dosed to begin with.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.430
But that's not your concern.

09:16.514 --> 09:20.685
Convince Bancroft the threat is past.
Produce a culprit if you have to.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.144
Frame someone innocent.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.897
Everyone's guilty of something.
It's just a matter of degree.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.524
What if I say no?

09:35.157 --> 09:37.076
-I didn't want to have this conversation.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.663
Not yet.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.593
That son of a bitch works for you?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.469
I've become a titan of industry,

09:55.553 --> 09:57.805
dealing with the many weaknesses
of the flesh.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.933
-I have interests that need protecting.
-You didn't answer my question.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.690
I heard you became familiar

10:07.773 --> 10:10.985
with the new interrogation programs
at the Wei Clinic.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.279
That place belongs to you?

10:13.362 --> 10:16.324
Information extraction
is a very lucrative niche market.

10:16.407 --> 10:20.411
I was tortured to death.
Over and over again.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.872
If I had known, I would have stopped it.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.961
These people you've become so attached to,

10:30.379 --> 10:35.843
Vernon Elliot, Kristin Ortega,
to me, they're fireflies,

10:36.636 --> 10:40.765
each a tiny spark whose beauty lies
in how quickly it's extinguished.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.186
Convince Bancroft the case is closed.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.064
Or your friends will go
into one of my other clinics

10:48.147 --> 10:51.984
and they won't come out
until they're quite, quite mad.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.243
I'll need a dipper.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.707
Jesus. You look like hell.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.335
Really? I spent hours on my hair.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.338
-Cleaned out my desk.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.672
I'm taking some me time.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.761
Any luck with
the Ghostwalker trace program?

11:18.844 --> 11:20.221
Tanaka told me to stop.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.848
It was an unauthorized use

11:22.932 --> 11:24.475
-of department resources.
-Of course.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.270
You really shouldn't be in here.
You're not supposed to be in here.

11:30.564 --> 11:33.943
No. It's blood from the homicidal bitch
who took Kovacs.

11:34.693 --> 11:35.694
I need a gene-mat typing.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.114
-No. You got suspended--
-On paid leave.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.325
Do you remember
when I almost got fired for saying

11:41.409 --> 11:43.619
I could see your areolas
through your shirt?

11:44.328 --> 11:45.162
Vaguely.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.249
-This is worse. I'll lose my job.
Listen to me.

11:48.332 --> 11:52.086
This woman single-handedly took out
a whole room of Carnage's people.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.755
I really need to know who she is.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.549
She's got Kovacs.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.554
Please.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.737
You know, they can check this
in the OrgDam lab.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.239
No. I can't trust them.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.159
I can't trust anybody.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.662
Except for you. Thank you.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.709
-Oh, there's one more thing.
-No. No more things.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.627
I thought you could do it
while I get changed.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.589
You're right. I do look like hell.

12:42.928 --> 12:47.641
-I believe you're my sister's bitch.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.769
You do not show her the proper respect.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.230
What is it with these Meths and respect?

12:53.314 --> 12:56.442
They're just rich assholes
who don't look their age.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.531
You misunderstand me, Mr. Kovacs.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.450
I know better than to trust you
in an elevator.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.411
Throughout history,
we have prayed to gods.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.372
Pleaded for their mercy,
begged for their protection.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.584
Avatars of sun and sky. Blood and war.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.880
The god of Abraham or Muhammad
or Christ or Krishna.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.883
All were silent.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.345
Just attack me, please.
It'll hurt less than listening to this.

13:24.428 --> 13:29.934
For the first time in human history,
when we pray, they answer.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.562
They're not gods. No matter how much
they listen to their own propaganda.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.816
Their power is absolute
and they never die.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.276
What else would you call them?

13:39.360 --> 13:43.656
Has anyone told you that
you're really fucked up in there?

13:43.739 --> 13:45.991
You are the brother of a living god.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.495
-Jesus Christ.
-Blessed to share her bone and blood.

13:49.578 --> 13:54.416
You will someday realize the holiness
of She Who Endures.

13:57.878 --> 14:02.633
Until then, your obedience will suffice.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.553
-Put this on your head.
-The fuck out of here.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.430
Your sister doesn't want you
to know our location.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.850
I have been told that you obey
or others die.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.894
Whom should I kill first?

14:22.444 --> 14:24.697
-You gotta go.
Come on, Mickey.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.950
All I'm asking is a facial rec scan
and a gene-mat typing.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.743
No, I mean, you gotta go.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.454
Kovacs, he just popped back up
on the grid.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.747
Psychasec in the Haight.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.377
I ran the facial rec, all right?
Now get outta here.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.920
Promise you'll get the gene-mat typing.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.463
-Promise.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.715
Yes! I promise. Go.

14:42.798 --> 14:43.799
-Go.
-Thanks.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.032
-You've got your Rerun.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.328
Tell your boss we're even now.
No more favors.

15:12.411 --> 15:16.206
Mr. Hemingway will decide
when your debt is clear. Understood?

15:16.290 --> 15:17.625
This ain't my dipper.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.128
I asked for a woman. She's in her 40s.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.923
Your sister wished me to tell you
that she is, quote,

15:24.006 --> 15:26.425
"Not running a charity for your strays."

15:26.967 --> 15:29.762
No. No. No. This isn't right.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.181
The DHF is correct.
The sleeve shouldn't matter.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.183
It's okay, Ava. You're sleeve-sick.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.894
I'm cross-sleeved! In a man!

15:36.977 --> 15:38.354
I know.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.314
Who are you?
Where the hell are you taking me?

15:41.565 --> 15:42.399
Home.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.444
Vernon They're all right?

15:46.028 --> 15:46.862
Yeah.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.492
-Shit.
-Make her go away.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.578
I'm not a magician.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.455
Do it or you'll be looking
for a new dipper.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.498
What the...

16:01.001 --> 16:02.795
I do this and you back the fuck off.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.590
Rei gets what she wants, but not with you
looking over my shoulder. Got it?

16:17.476 --> 16:18.894
Oh, God.

16:19.395 --> 16:23.565
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Thank God. You're alive!

16:25.401 --> 16:28.195
You thought Ryker's sleeve was damaged?
It's not.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.031
No. I thought you were dead.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.408
I'm fine.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.410
Good.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.245
Um...

16:36.870 --> 16:38.372
Why are you at Psychasec?

16:39.039 --> 16:41.500
I'm, uh... trying to get a new sleeve

16:41.583 --> 16:43.752
that's not on the shitlist
of all the criminals in this city.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.255
You want to put Ryker's sleeve
back on the slab?

16:46.338 --> 16:48.048
I'd love to, but Bancroft is blocking me.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.509
I can't get out of this fucking skin
because of you.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.055
What's the hell is going on with you?
What's happening?

16:56.974 --> 16:59.476
Is it that woman

16:59.560 --> 17:01.729
-Nobody.

17:01.812 --> 17:02.646
Nobody?

17:03.063 --> 17:06.191
She mowed her way through
Carnage's boys with a sword.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.401
She's no one?

17:11.447 --> 17:14.908
She's someone who actually cares about <i>me.</i>

17:14.992 --> 17:16.160
What?

17:16.243 --> 17:19.329
Whatever you think
was happening between us...

17:20.998 --> 17:23.125
it didn't matter.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.669
It meant nothing to me.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.838
It's her I was looking for.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.423
And I found her.

17:29.506 --> 17:33.510
-It's over.
-No. No! I don't fucking believe that.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.472
-I don't believe you.
-I'll get you your sleeve back.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.474
Just have a little dignity.

17:53.489 --> 17:59.620
<i>♪ When I was just a little girl ♪</i>

17:59.703 --> 18:04.666
<i>" ♪</i>

18:08.545 --> 18:09.838
-Indubitably.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.550
Throwing blades is an excellent way
to increase one's hand-eye coordination.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.721
So is sewing. Or tennis.
Or playing the motherfucking violin!

18:17.805 --> 18:21.141
To my knowledge, no one has ever
crushed the testicles of an assailant

18:21.225 --> 18:22.434
using a stringed instrument.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.062
-The goal is to be empowered.

18:25.145 --> 18:29.191
The use of deadly force, honed
and developed in a virtual environment,

18:29.274 --> 18:32.277
may one day give her the confidence
to feel safe in the real one,

18:32.361 --> 18:35.197
and perhaps, soon...

18:36.490 --> 18:37.407
reenter it.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.243
Mr. Kovacs.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.707
Mr. Kovacs, I'm so glad to see you.

18:45.791 --> 18:50.629
I was troubled by your long absence
from my establishment.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.506
Kovacs, where you been?

18:59.888 --> 19:02.933
Whoa, whoa! Back off, buddy.
What are you, drunk?

19:04.601 --> 19:05.894
Vernon.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.813
It's me.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.274
Ava.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.027
I'm just a little sleeve-sick.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.659
What the hell is going on here, Kovacs?

19:20.742 --> 19:23.036
I need a dipper to run a hack,

19:23.120 --> 19:25.289
subvert security protocols
and inject code.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.084
I heard your wife was pretty good,
so I got her out.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.551
Ava?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.222
There were some setbacks.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.724
Like, I'm a man.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.934
Surely true love triumphs over all?

19:46.018 --> 19:46.977
Shut up, Poe.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.606
Vern.

19:53.400 --> 19:57.029
I never thought I'd touch you again.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.157
Ava?

20:01.658 --> 20:04.912
It's me. Baby, it's really me.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.582
-So romantic.

20:13.837 --> 20:14.963
Where's Lizzie?

20:20.427 --> 20:24.348
There, uh...
There may be some things we...

20:25.933 --> 20:28.143
There may be some things
I have to tell you.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.671
Ava...

20:57.047 --> 20:58.215
Honey...

21:00.926 --> 21:02.719
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.472
Me too.

21:21.822 --> 21:25.450
All that happened and I wasn't there.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.042
Am I good yet?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.545
Far better than good.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.214
You are formidable.

21:43.010 --> 21:43.885
Wait.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.932
Perhaps we should go.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.409
Mom?

22:15.751 --> 22:19.004
<i>Sometimes,</i>
<i>belief isn't about what we can see.</i>

22:21.715 --> 22:22.966
<i>It's about what we can't.</i>

22:23.050 --> 22:25.177
I... I missed you so much.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.430
I know. I'm sorry.
Sweetheart, I'm so sorry.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.390
I should have been there.

22:30.474 --> 22:35.395
But I'm here now and I'm never leaving,
ever. I promise you.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.397
Something's different.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.656
-You changed your hair.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.034
Yeah.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.411
Dad!

22:52.120 --> 22:53.872
Been a while, ladybug.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.359
See?

23:22.442 --> 23:24.820
Eddie found a way
to do time dilation for me,

23:24.903 --> 23:27.656
so I can practice for months in here
when it's just days in the real.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.583
I hate that sign.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.884
-There are a variety of species

23:47.968 --> 23:50.929
that do not rely on visual cues
to find their own kind.

23:51.012 --> 23:54.224
The star-nosed mole, for example,
is utterly blind,

23:54.307 --> 23:56.393
-yet has no difficulty finding its mothe--
-Poe.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.273
You brought my daughter here. You're teaching her how to hurt people.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.278
-Technically, I'm teaching.
-I'll get to you in a minute.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.116
You're destroying who she is.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.034
Someone else did that already.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.496
She's shattered.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.915
Whoever she was is dead.

24:22.043 --> 24:24.629
What... What am I
supposed to do with that?

24:24.713 --> 24:27.424
Same thing as she did. Adapt.

24:27.757 --> 24:29.676
Because my sister
will do way worse than kill you

24:29.759 --> 24:32.596
if I don't close the Bancroft case.
And I need you on this run.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.308
I'm gonna need all of you.

24:37.392 --> 24:38.351
Really?

24:38.935 --> 24:40.061
I wouldn't get too excited.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.982
What does this run involve, exactly?

24:46.943 --> 24:50.489
Lying. Stealing. Breaking the law.

24:51.072 --> 24:54.242
If we're going to pull this off,
we gotta get our hands dirty.

24:56.870 --> 25:00.165
-Envoys who died at Stronghold.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.791
Are you kidding me?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.628
They were infected with Rawling.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.379
Rawling is fatal.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.799
It corrupts all electronic data,
destroys stacks.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.635
How did you survive?

25:11.718 --> 25:13.094
I was...

25:15.597 --> 25:18.517
out of range
of the viral transmission blast.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.145
I need you to take these fragments
and recreate the malware.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.442
Fucking with Bancroft's head is one thing,
but using this--

25:27.525 --> 25:29.653
Wanna go back on ice
and leave Lizzie without a mother?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.616
Then get to work.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.618
When you're done, deliver it to Poe.

25:40.330 --> 25:44.584
I can't believe you thought
it was bowling night.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.466
I have nothing further to bet.

25:51.549 --> 25:54.010
Oh, sure you do.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.887
I hear you have another guest.

25:56.304 --> 26:00.475
A nutcase human murder victim.
I can always use the crazy ones.

26:01.059 --> 26:04.437
Make for great recordings.
Really get into it.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.232
Screaming.

26:07.315 --> 26:09.192
There's a huge market for that shit.

26:09.859 --> 26:13.905
So if I win, I'll take her off your hands.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.657
If you win...

26:15.824 --> 26:19.786
Well, you never win.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.205
Her name is Miss Elizabeth
and she's my friend.

26:22.289 --> 26:26.126
Oh, you should never name them.
Makes you sentimental.

26:26.585 --> 26:31.590
And you're enough of a human lover
as it is.

26:38.346 --> 26:41.099
All in, you inelegant ass.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.439
Well, here comes the river.

26:50.317 --> 26:53.820
Boom!

26:53.903 --> 26:55.864
Come to Papa.

26:57.324 --> 27:01.911
Oh, walk away,
you human-loving son of a bitch!

27:02.495 --> 27:04.956
I want her here tomorrow!

27:06.416 --> 27:10.629
I feel a little...

27:19.387 --> 27:22.349
-I'm in. Here it comes.
-Got it.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.854
We need an image of Bancroft
from that night.

27:27.937 --> 27:30.857
Not getting that Fightdrome footage,
though. It's analog.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.818
BCPD seized the tapes
and scanned them after the raid.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.655
Looks like Prescott got the originals
and destroyed them.

27:38.531 --> 27:41.076
-But it got in the system.
-Damn, woman.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.546
<i>Now all that was left </i>
<i>was to sell Bancroft the lie.</i>

27:55.840 --> 27:58.468
So you won't
take me up on my offer?

27:59.594 --> 28:00.678
Keeping my word.

28:01.596 --> 28:05.058
It's not too late, you know.
We can leave right now.

28:05.141 --> 28:08.019
Make all your fantasies come true.
All you have to do is say yes.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.730
You really don't want me telling Bancroft
what happened.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.151
Anyone else might have thought
you'd killed him yourself.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.070
Is that what you think?

28:23.910 --> 28:27.455
Why have you insisted
on all these people being here?

28:28.540 --> 28:31.292
-Because one of them killed you.
-Oh.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.711
And the rest
are about to be witnesses.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.967
Clarissa is here at my invitation. After all, she did advise me to hire you.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.973
So, you'd better be on point
or I'll be looking for a refund.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.434
I'm sure that won't be an issue, Laurens.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.270
Let's hear what the Envoy has to say.

28:56.818 --> 29:00.905
From the beginning of this case,
the details just didn't add up.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.116
All the evidence said suicide.

29:03.783 --> 29:06.870
It was neat, tidy, perfect.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.290
Nothing real is perfect.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.877
Someone wanted the world to believe
that you killed yourself.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.422
But how could you possibly
bring down Laurens Bancroft?

29:23.970 --> 29:27.474
This is a VR jack-in brothel
called Prick Up.

29:27.557 --> 29:30.643
It specializes in simulated rape
and murder.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.396
It's the last place you visited
before you died.

29:33.480 --> 29:37.233
I'm not overly familiar
with this particular establishment.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.407
Yeah.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.534
I still got it.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.954
And yet, there you are.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.581
Prick Up was a trap.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.374
Set up just for you.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.671
Captain, check in
with your cybercrimes unit.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.385
Yeah. Do we have any reports
on a place called Prick Up?

30:04.969 --> 30:06.596
I'm looking for anything.

30:08.848 --> 30:09.933
Okay.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.560
All right. Thanks.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.438
Sir, Prick Up has shut down.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.524
Are you gonna tell him?

30:19.484 --> 30:21.611
The core was destroyed by Rawling virus.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.534
<i>Prick Up went insane. The AI core melted.</i>

30:28.451 --> 30:29.869
You were infected.

30:29.953 --> 30:32.247
Your download at Psychasec was clean.

30:33.122 --> 30:36.960
So your stack needed to be contaminated
by direct contact, which means VR 'trodes.

30:37.043 --> 30:41.047
-No. This is completely absurd--
-Here's the next interesting thing.

30:41.714 --> 30:44.467
Prescott knows everything
about what happened in Osaka.

30:46.636 --> 30:50.390
I was with Mr. Bancroft. That's no secret.
I often accompany him as counsel.

30:50.473 --> 30:53.309
You forgot to mention that he was furious
with his son when he returned.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.436
Put a beating on him at Fightdrome.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.857
You wore a blonde sleeve in Osaka. Right?

31:02.151 --> 31:04.904
I wear a variety of sleeves.
It's part of my travel allowance.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.197
This one?

31:11.536 --> 31:15.206
Yes. But... what's all this?

31:16.833 --> 31:20.420
This is wrong.
We're about to destroy her life.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.965
-And people like her destroyed Lizzie's.
-I don't want to be people like her.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.888
It's a bill for damages. Signed by you.

31:30.471 --> 31:32.557
Damage from the sleeve
being strangled and raped.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.808
What?

31:34.392 --> 31:37.687
-I've never seen this invoice.
-Because Prescott handled it.

31:37.770 --> 31:40.356
Wh This is ridiculous.
Complete fiction.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.525
-Not now.

31:42.609 --> 31:45.278
Now, why would she pay damages
on a work sleeve herself?

31:45.361 --> 31:47.906
Because she lost access to company funds.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.366
-If I fired her.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.953
Mr. Bancroft, you can't possibly
be taking anything he says--

31:54.037 --> 31:56.331
The women you like to hurt
all got something in common.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.334
They look like Prescott did that weekend.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.086
Like your wife.

32:04.380 --> 32:07.508
He wants to get rid of me.
He's trying to replace me.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.135
Did he rape you?

32:09.218 --> 32:12.472
Or did you come on to him because you saw
his anger as an opportunity for leverage?

32:12.555 --> 32:14.974
After everything
this family has done for you.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.518
You know I would never-- I--

32:17.936 --> 32:21.272
Whatever happened between you in Osaka,
you decided to fire her over it.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.650
No. None of this is true.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.693
The Envoy is manipulating you.
Don't you see that?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.862
Who knows your habits better than anyone?

32:28.404 --> 32:31.908
She knew that when you're this angry,
you'll find the nearest VR dive,

32:31.991 --> 32:34.243
where you can kill as many blonde whores
as you want.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.830
All she had to do was time your arrival
to Prick Up for the viral strike.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.666
None of this
was supposed to look like murder.

32:39.749 --> 32:42.251
It was all supposed to look like
just bad fucking luck.

32:42.835 --> 32:46.714
Malware racing up your needlecast
into your satellite backups

32:46.798 --> 32:48.341
and destroying them.

32:48.758 --> 32:52.887
<i>When you got home, </i>
<i>your internal contam alarm was screaming.</i>

32:53.638 --> 32:55.890
<i>You had to stop your backup </i>
<i>from going through.</i>

32:56.432 --> 32:58.893
<i>-You didn't have much time.</i>
<i></i>

32:59.519 --> 33:02.397
Do it! Do it! Do it!

33:02.981 --> 33:04.023
-No!

33:08.736 --> 33:11.781
Do you feel it, Laurens

33:13.992 --> 33:15.702
-That's mine. Give it to me.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.246
-No, it's not yours.

33:18.329 --> 33:22.125
-Give it!
-It's not yours. I'm not yours!

33:22.709 --> 33:23.793
Years of groveling...

33:23.876 --> 33:27.797
-No, give it to me! Mine!
-...and serving and humiliating myself.

33:28.381 --> 33:31.426
-All I ever wanted to be was one of you.
-Give it!

33:31.509 --> 33:33.886
And you threw me out like trash,

33:33.970 --> 33:36.931
all because you couldn't control yourself.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.641
Help me, please.

33:38.725 --> 33:39.934
Please.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.687
-No.
<i>He's lying!</i>

33:43.312 --> 33:44.981
All of it, every fucking word.

33:45.064 --> 33:48.651
Curtis, if she speaks again,
I want you to hurt her. I don't care how.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.615
It was supposed to look
like Bancroft went crazy,

33:54.699 --> 33:57.535
his backups were shredded
and he killed himself.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.331
That's what I was waiting for.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.125
There you go. No!

34:06.711 --> 34:08.046
No, I can't!

34:08.421 --> 34:09.714
I can't. No!

34:09.797 --> 34:12.633
That's what I said.
You didn't listen to me either.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.223
But you outsmarted her.

34:19.682 --> 34:23.436
Right. I must have faked the needlecast.

34:24.437 --> 34:29.692
Pretend I'd done the backup,
so you just killed me too soon.

34:29.776 --> 34:32.737
Laurens, think about what he's saying.

34:32.820 --> 34:36.282
I have been nothing but loyal to you,
to this family.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.576
Get her out of my house.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.370
No, get your hands off me!

34:41.454 --> 34:43.164
Oumou Prescott, you are under arrest.

34:43.247 --> 34:46.501
Leave her alone. Let her go.

34:48.294 --> 34:51.005
Not a word of this will leave this room.
Is that understood?

34:51.422 --> 34:53.466
-Of course, Mr. Bancroft.
-Yes, sir.

34:53.549 --> 34:54.383
Good.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.344
I'm not gonna press charges.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.347
Thank you.
-No.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.307
I am going to ruin you.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.644
Your access to Aerium is withdrawn.

35:04.727 --> 35:07.396
Your license to practice law
will be revoked.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.441
No Meth will ever hire you.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.444
And everything you own
will be confiscated.

35:17.907 --> 35:19.367
Laurens, please!

35:19.450 --> 35:24.122
You are never going to leave
the ground again. Is that understood?

35:24.205 --> 35:26.165
Don't do this. Don't do this.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.459
Find a gutter. Throw her in it.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.003
No. No. Please. Please. This is...

35:31.087 --> 35:34.632
He's lying! He's lying!
None of this is true! I--

35:34.715 --> 35:36.217
You stop talking.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.010
Get her out of here.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.470
Aah!

35:56.362 --> 35:58.698
I need my pardon and my payment.

36:02.034 --> 36:03.494
In the end...

36:05.246 --> 36:07.039
my great mystery was...

36:08.291 --> 36:13.629
nothing more than human greed
and my own weakness.

36:14.839 --> 36:18.134
Well, there we are.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.264
I'll make the necessary arrangements.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.771
When I heard you'd invited them all in,

36:30.855 --> 36:32.982
I thought you were trying
to outmaneuver me.

36:33.065 --> 36:36.736
-It works better in a group.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.822
Convince the crowd,
you're more likely to convince the man.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.533
You played them well.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.341
You won.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.301
You convinced him.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.345
Reileen won.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.056
I just did what I was told. How do we practice deceit?

37:11.604 --> 37:14.482
We rip the truth apart
and reweave it into the lie.

37:15.983 --> 37:17.652
Nothing is more convincing.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.908
<i>People talk about Envoy Intuition</i>
<i>like it's magic.</i>

37:24.825 --> 37:25.743
<i>It's not.</i>

37:26.827 --> 37:29.330
<i>It's a pull at the back of the mind.</i>

37:30.414 --> 37:33.960
<i>A scratch inside your skull </i>
<i>that won't go away.</i>

37:35.503 --> 37:36.879
<i>It's the details.</i>

37:45.846 --> 37:48.099
I told you not to call me here.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.519
<i>Are you cleaned up?</i>

37:51.602 --> 37:55.022
Yeah. Kovacs left a tab open for me
at the hospital.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.775
Did you get a hit on the gene

37:58.234 --> 38:00.194
<i>-That's not a no.</i>

38:02.154 --> 38:03.572
Come on, Mickey. You know something.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.866
No, I didn't say that.
Did you find Kovacs yet?

38:05.950 --> 38:06.951
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:07.868 --> 38:09.829
I don't know. Something's wrong.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.914
-I think he's in trouble.
<i></i>

38:12.748 --> 38:14.834
Because he was a total fucking prick.

38:14.917 --> 38:18.004
You know, that's one interpretation.
Another is that he <i>is </i>a prick.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.715
What about the trace?

38:20.798 --> 38:23.467
We got a hit on the gene-mat.
I'm gonna send you the specs.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.513
You are not gonna believe from where.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.056
Psychasec?

38:31.183 --> 38:32.184
Who's the client?

38:32.268 --> 38:33.561
That's the weird thing.

38:33.644 --> 38:37.315
I've got the vault number,
and it's not registered to any account.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.817
<i>The gene-mat belongs to nobody.</i>

38:40.234 --> 38:41.610
Send me the vault info.

38:41.694 --> 38:42.778
Okay, I'll send it now.

38:44.697 --> 38:47.283
And that's it. That's the last time,
understood? I'm done.

38:47.366 --> 38:48.909
<i>-I'm out.</i>
-No, Mickey. Wait.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.620
What about tracking the Ghostwalker?
He's still out there.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.497
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.333
And so is my pension.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.710
<i>-I chase one, I lose the other.</i>
-Come on, Mickey, please.

38:57.793 --> 38:58.836
<i>Listen to me.</i>

38:58.919 --> 39:04.091
I love you and when you get fired,
I'm going to deny we ever met.

39:23.235 --> 39:24.779
-Hey!
-Hi, Gus.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.405
Remember me?

39:28.199 --> 39:31.744
I picked you up last year for
that misdemeanor sleeve-jack in Licktown.

39:31.827 --> 39:35.956
-Never got reported to your employer.
-No, I had those records sealed.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.211
It was a misunderstanding.

39:40.294 --> 39:43.631
I think Psychasec has a right to know,
don't you?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.759
I mean, they'll fire you
and blackball you, but...

39:47.551 --> 39:49.345
crime doesn't pay, does it?

39:50.179 --> 39:51.180
What do you want?

40:05.694 --> 40:07.405
Sometimes I come up here

40:07.488 --> 40:12.952
when I have decisions to make
or difficulties to face.

40:16.288 --> 40:19.166
<i>I knew the date and time </i>
<i>of Bancroft's death.</i>

40:20.292 --> 40:22.878
<i>The telescope returned </i>
<i>to the same position it was in</i>

40:23.462 --> 40:26.882
<i>when he looked through it, </i>
<i>right before he died.</i>

40:33.889 --> 40:35.057
<i>Our own...</i>

40:36.434 --> 40:39.520
satellite of sin, Head in the Clouds.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.607
<i>I've become a titan of industry,</i>

40:43.691 --> 40:46.235
dealing with the many weaknesses
of the flesh.

40:46.318 --> 40:49.864
We became hungry for things
that reality could no longer offer.

40:49.947 --> 40:53.868
I have a line that
I am very careful not to cross.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.495
<i>You have no idea </i>
<i>what he's capable of.</i>

40:56.829 --> 40:58.998
<i>Being high on Stallion</i>
<i>may have affected his judgment.</i>

40:59.081 --> 41:00.541
Male aggression enhancer.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.710
<i>Gave him what he always wanted.</i>

41:02.793 --> 41:04.420
<i>She said he needed her.</i>

41:04.503 --> 41:06.505
<i>And he will want</i>
<i>someone to punish.</i>

41:06.589 --> 41:08.048
You will not be forgiven.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.383
You see, don't you?

41:10.468 --> 41:12.386
What you wove your lie from?

41:18.309 --> 41:19.518
The truth.

41:42.416 --> 41:44.460
Your payment has been processed.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.589
That is your pardon.

41:48.672 --> 41:51.509
If you speak of this to anyone,
I will have you killed.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.677
Permanently.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.055
It was great working with you too.

42:27.336 --> 42:28.963
Jeez, relax.

42:29.338 --> 42:31.632
Just get me in. I'll do the rest.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.390
-This is the one.
-Open it.

42:39.473 --> 42:41.016
I don't know.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.353
No one's ever gonna know I was here.

42:44.937 --> 42:45.938
Promise.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.219
Let's take a look at you.

43:24.810 --> 43:25.894
It's her.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.152
Yeah. Definitely her.

43:33.611 --> 43:36.864
Okay. Gonna need all the information
you have on this client.

43:36.947 --> 43:38.657
Everything on the databa--

43:39.658 --> 43:41.118
Hey!

43:41.702 --> 43:42.703
Hey!

43:47.958 --> 43:49.293
Open the door!

43:49.793 --> 43:51.962
Open the door right fucking now!

44:03.891 --> 44:05.059
Oh, shit.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.396
Mickey. Mickey?

44:09.480 --> 44:11.607
Come on. God damn it. Answer!

44:14.652 --> 44:16.320
I don't know if this is going through,

44:16.403 --> 44:20.157
but I've been locked into one
of the vaults here in Psychasec. I don't--

44:20.240 --> 44:22.618
<i>Pod failure detected.</i>

44:33.087 --> 44:34.046
Who are you?

44:37.758 --> 44:40.469
Of course. You're the new one.

44:42.054 --> 44:43.889
The love of his life.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.393
This week, anyway.

44:50.938 --> 44:54.608
Tak's taste in women
is so boringly consistent.

44:56.318 --> 45:00.030
Earnest, heroic, beautiful.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.741
And not very smart.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.147
That wasn't very nice.

45:33.730 --> 45:36.108
I wasn't trying to be nice, you bitch.

45:40.529 --> 45:42.197
You still haven't answered my question.

45:44.408 --> 45:45.742
Who are you?

45:49.079 --> 45:51.123
<i>¡Puta madre!</i>

45:53.292 --> 45:55.252

<i>System override. All units cleared.</i>

how much money you just cost me?

47:40.482 --> 47:41.984
Who the fuck are you?

47:42.526 --> 47:43.652
Nobody.

48:25.986 --> 48:26.945
Please.

48:27.029 --> 48:31.033
She locked me in here. It's so cold.

48:40.959 --> 48:43.670
Hey. It's okay.

48:45.631 --> 48:46.882
Don't be afraid.
