00:30.497 --> 00:34.299
To everyone that knew me
and to those who didn't,

00:34.301 --> 00:37.703
this is my last will
and testament.

00:37.705 --> 00:41.273
I have no personal possessions
worth giving,

00:41.275 --> 00:43.142
only my thoughts

00:43.144 --> 00:46.278
and my recollections
I hand to you.

00:49.449 --> 00:54.586
Sometimes in death,
breath is drawn to new life,

00:54.588 --> 00:57.256
and a spirit dies
to be reborn.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.092
Today is the day
of my namesake's reckoning,

01:00.094 --> 01:04.328
and one day, we'll dine
in Valhalla with Odin.

01:04.331 --> 01:07.199
We will again
be one as family,

01:07.201 --> 01:09.334
the way
it was intended to be.

01:09.336 --> 01:13.605
Your son, brother,
and acquaintance,

01:13.607 --> 01:16.608
Magnus Burwood.

01:47.208 --> 01:51.143
May we all become Vikings
after I am gone.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.745
See you in Valhalla.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.310
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.565
Next up, a bizarre story

03:19.567 --> 03:21.934
involving a meth distributor
and a Viking.

03:21.936 --> 03:25.804
We now take you on the scene
with James Warner.

03:25.806 --> 03:26.672
James?

03:26.674 --> 03:27.573
Thank you, Rick.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.841
We are here at the home
of Carlos Ruiz,

03:29.843 --> 03:32.544
an apparent crystal
methamphetamine distributor,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.613
whose home contained
over 12 pounds

03:34.615 --> 03:36.848
of pure crystallized
methamphetamine,

03:36.850 --> 03:37.783
according to police.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.519
Last night,
26-year-old Maxwell Burwood

03:40.521 --> 03:43.822
dressed as a Viking
and broke into Ruiz's home.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.391
Burwood was then
shot and killed

03:46.393 --> 03:47.859
during the altercation.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.595
Ruiz, now in police custody,

03:49.597 --> 03:52.264
says that Burwood
was high on crystal meth

03:52.266 --> 03:54.800
and tried to attack him
with a sword.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.369
A neighbor close by
reported hearing Burwood

03:57.371 --> 03:59.605
screaming vengeance
for his deceased girlfriend,

03:59.607 --> 04:02.507
Jamie Tanner, who was said
to have overdosed

04:02.509 --> 04:05.510
inside Ruiz's home
only weeks earlier.

04:05.512 --> 04:08.413
Maxwell was also known
by his Nordic name

04:08.415 --> 04:09.014
Magnus MacTanner

04:09.016 --> 04:11.950
at an alternative drug rehabili
-
tation center in Iceland.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.254
This story has garnered
a cult following

04:15.256 --> 04:17.923
of local bloggers and
comic book aficionados

04:17.925 --> 04:19.291
similar to Burwood.

04:19.293 --> 04:19.791
Oh, my God.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.959
They gather
outside the Burwood home

04:21.962 --> 04:23.802
hoping for
more information.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.274
Mm.

04:41.648 --> 04:42.047
Hey, Jo.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.816
Oh, shit.
Pete, I totally forgot.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.318
Oh, no.
That's totally cool.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.953
I mean, if you're busy
or something,

04:47.955 --> 04:49.588
I can come back
another time.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.622
It's...
No.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.293
It's just, uh...
Just come in.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.428
There was
this news story.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.130
I got you flowers.
I hope you like daisies.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.700
I went for roses, but then she
said it'd be way too serious,

05:01.702 --> 05:03.335
and then
carnations came up,

05:03.337 --> 05:05.671
but she said
daisies were, like,

05:05.673 --> 05:06.838
really in right now.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.973
I'm sorry I'm early.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.007
I just thought,
you know,

05:09.009 --> 05:11.943
we could hang out a little bit
before if you want.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.512
Hey, you want a drink?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.513
No. That's... That's cool.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.915
It kinda makes me
a little crazy.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.418
Oh, what about
the other night?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.485
That was just...

05:20.487 --> 05:22.654
I kinda needed
to work up the courage

05:22.656 --> 05:25.957
to sorta do,
you know, what we...

05:27.328 --> 05:28.727
did.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.629
...had a big problem
in this neighborhood,

05:30.631 --> 05:32.731
so, you know,
it's really sad

05:32.733 --> 05:33.598
that somebody died,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.701
but it's kinda great
that something

05:35.703 --> 05:37.069
is being done
about it. Maybe...

05:37.071 --> 05:39.438
So do you want to go
get some food?

05:39.440 --> 05:42.007
Because if not,
it's totally fine.

05:42.009 --> 05:42.708
I can...

05:42.710 --> 05:44.042
Um, no, I just... It's...

05:44.044 --> 05:45.444
No, you know what?

05:45.446 --> 05:46.411
It's... It's fine.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.879
I... I think I'm gonna go.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.081
You know
that Viking guy?

05:49.083 --> 05:51.983
Yeah. What about him?

05:52.752 --> 05:55.487
He's my brother.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.456
Really?

05:57.458 --> 05:58.056
Yeah.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.624
I am so sorry, Jo.

05:59.626 --> 06:02.594
I... I don't even know
what to say.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.428
I need to go home.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.596
I need to go home,
right?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.631
That's what you do
after someone dies.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.066
I mean, yeah.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.435
I can't believe I have
to deal with these people.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.770
Who?
Oh, my family.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.738
Do you not like them?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.906
I-It's very complicated.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.675
Do you not have anybody
to go with you?

06:16.677 --> 06:18.443
'Cause I'll totally
go with you if you want.

06:18.445 --> 06:21.380
No. That's really, really,
sweet of you, but I just

06:21.382 --> 06:22.614
I can just go home
and pack a bag,

06:22.616 --> 06:24.750
and we can leave first thing
in the morning.

06:24.752 --> 06:25.684
Not a good idea.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.618
Jo, listen to me.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.753
You just lost somebody.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.390
Right now, you definitely shoul
d
not be by yourself.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.811
Oh, my God.

07:25.813 --> 07:26.945
Car. Car.
Excuse me.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.146
Right here?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.649
Excuse me.
What's your name?

07:34.987 --> 07:37.689
Are you part
of the Burwood family?

07:37.691 --> 07:41.092
Are you an ex-lover
of the Viking murderer?

07:43.162 --> 07:45.764
Sir? Excuse me.
Excuse me.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.832
Excuse me.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.099
Pete!

07:55.909 --> 07:57.042
No comment?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.686
Hello?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.654
As you inhale,

08:09.656 --> 08:12.524
I want you to be one
with the Earth.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.727
Drop your petals
to the ground...

08:16.964 --> 08:20.499
and feel their energy
lift you up.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.936
Exhale.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.044
Hi, Dad.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.179
Jo?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.581
Is that you?

08:36.582 --> 08:37.682
It's me.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.517
Johana.
Oh.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.585
Ah, cool.
Who's this?

08:40.587 --> 08:43.255
I've never seen this person
before in my life.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.022
I'm Faye.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.291
But what's
in a name, right?

08:46.293 --> 08:47.993
I... I don't know.

08:49.228 --> 08:50.929
Faye's my nurse.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.731
She helps out
around here.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.599
She used to deliver
my groceries.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.903
I came by one day,
and I said, "Do you

08:57.905 --> 08:58.803
need help, man?"

08:58.805 --> 09:01.206
He was
super stoked about it.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.307
Oh.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.108
Hey, Johana,

09:03.110 --> 09:05.977
did those yuppies
out there bother you?

09:05.979 --> 09:06.711
Uh, yuppies? No.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.246
We hardly noticed.
No. That's...

09:08.248 --> 09:09.681
Okay.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.216
You know,
Faye's the best.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.319
Our meditation sessions
have guided me through

09:14.321 --> 09:15.120
this whole process.

09:15.122 --> 09:18.323
Those people out there,
I block 'em out merely

09:18.325 --> 09:20.058
with the power of my mind.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.628
You're like a monk.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.829
Who're you?

09:24.831 --> 09:25.831
This is Pete.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.800
We're dating.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.136
I... I noticed
that you, um, are

09:31.138 --> 09:32.504
using a cane now.

09:32.506 --> 09:33.705
Why is...
Oh, yeah.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.239
What can I say?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.607
My... My legs
are getting old.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.642
Oh!

09:37.644 --> 09:40.045
Medication time.
Ah.

09:43.983 --> 09:47.752
And what's in the,
uh, container?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.888
Oh, this is
a spirit concoction

09:49.890 --> 09:51.656
with a wheatgrass base.

09:51.658 --> 09:52.724
Nice.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.930
Yum.
Delicious.

09:59.799 --> 10:00.665
Oh, Jo.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.934
There's something
I want to show you.

10:10.810 --> 10:11.710
Ta-da.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.211
You saved that? God.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.813
I painted that
when I was like, 10.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.881
It's my favorite.
We saved 'em all.

10:16.883 --> 10:17.616
So good.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.683
Okay,
can you just please

10:18.685 --> 10:20.385
hide that
while I'm here?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.087
What? Why?

10:22.089 --> 10:22.787
Can I have this?

10:22.789 --> 10:25.023
Dad, please.
I'm asking you.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.157
All right.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.628
Whatever makes
my little girl happy.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.931
Okay. So, um, are we
the first ones here?

10:32.933 --> 10:34.699
Oh, no. Barry's
around here somewhere.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.635
He brought
a little friend, too.

10:36.637 --> 10:40.338
He is
so beautiful.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.856
Way off.

11:00.893 --> 11:01.393
Is that Barry?

11:01.395 --> 11:04.929
I actually have
no idea who that is.

11:04.931 --> 11:05.697
Hello.

11:05.699 --> 11:09.200
Hello?
Hey, Jo-blo!

11:09.202 --> 11:10.735
Oh, my God.
Barry?

11:10.737 --> 11:11.169
Hey.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.071
Wow. You are
so skinny.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.205
Yeah.
Hey, I'm Pete.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.774
It's so nice
to meet you.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.877
Hi, Pete. 40 pounds in the last
year. Can you believe it?

11:18.879 --> 11:19.978
Jesus.
Were you, like,

11:19.980 --> 11:21.346
really fat before
or something?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.882
Ugh, the fattest.
You gotta see this.

11:23.884 --> 11:24.983
You carry around
a picture?

11:24.985 --> 11:28.253
Always, to remind me
how fat I was.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.187
Wow.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.755
Oh, my God.

11:30.757 --> 11:31.790
Wow.
Yeah.

11:31.792 --> 11:32.691
Congratulations,
man.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.860
Thank you. I guess that's
one of the benefits

11:35.862 --> 11:37.228
of having
a live-in trainer.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.731
Guys, this is Makewi,
my beau.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.765
Hi.
Oh, yeah.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.367
Hi. I'm Peter.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.335
I'm Jo's beau.
"Joe's beau."

11:44.337 --> 11:46.438
Must be a poet,
'cause that rhymed.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.372
Okay, easy, tiger.
What?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.807
Barry's gay,
by the way.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.941
I kind of
figured that out.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.177
Well, let's just throw
a parade in my honor.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.344
Let's do it!

11:53.346 --> 11:55.447
Sorry.
So, Makewi.

11:55.449 --> 11:56.047
Mm.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.315
What kind of name
is Makewi?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.317
It's Hawaiian,
means Matthew.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.386
How exotic.
Isn't it?

12:01.388 --> 12:01.953
Yeah.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.355
Have you guys seen Dad
and his nurse?

12:04.357 --> 12:06.458
Yeah.
That was very weird.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.960
Yeah. Has Don
showed up yet?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.428
No.
Ugh.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.865
So, haole Pete,

12:13.867 --> 12:14.933
how are you with a bow?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.234
Ooh, yeah. Good idea.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.169
Why don't you guys
go play Robin Hood

12:18.171 --> 12:19.003
while the adults catch up?

12:19.005 --> 12:21.339
No, no. The sarcasm
was directed at Kiwi.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.742
I can be a bit of a bitch
sometimes.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.810
Yes, you can.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.112
Want a beer?

12:27.114 --> 12:27.912
Yes, please.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.215
That'd be wonderful.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.189
Uh-huh.
With your right.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.157
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.425
Grab an arrow.
Okay.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.292
There you go.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.295
So, uh, did Magilly
bring his own haystacks?

12:44.297 --> 12:46.798
Makewi.
Oh.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.500
I brought the hay.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.201
Why?

12:50.203 --> 12:50.902
Therapy.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.772
He used to be addicted
to OxyContin.

12:53.774 --> 12:57.242
But since taking up archery,
he stopped and now

12:57.244 --> 12:58.143
only smokes weed.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.845
And eats
peyote and mushrooms

13:00.847 --> 13:01.546
every now and again.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.315
But, you know, if it's from the
ground, I guess it's okay,

13:04.317 --> 13:04.816
right?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.918
Wow, you sound like a really
good doctor, Barry.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.519
I pick my battles.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.487
And the, uh...
The bows and arrows?

13:09.489 --> 13:12.290
I told him
to pick up a hobby,

13:12.292 --> 13:13.191
so there it is.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.459
Hmm.
I was going on the theory

13:14.461 --> 13:16.127
that idle hands are
the devil's playthings.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.263
You know, that, and he wanted
to pick up a skill

13:18.265 --> 13:21.366
that would prepare him
for the zombie apocalypse.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.169
Oh, well, you know, that
makes perfect sense.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.937
I don't date Kiwi
for his brains.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.005
That's funny.
More.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.908
So I guess psychology is really
working out for you.

13:29.910 --> 13:30.875
Like that.
Yeah.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.011
Makewi was
my first patient.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.979
Free sessions
for free workouts.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.081
Free sex
for the both of us.

13:37.083 --> 13:37.916
Ugh. Gross.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.251
So what's the story
with this guy?

13:40.253 --> 13:43.488
We met in my building, been han
ging out for a little bit.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.490
He's a nice enough guy.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.391
It's good you're
finally dating again.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.393
What do you mean
finally?

13:47.394 --> 13:49.427
Let's not pretend
we don't stalk each other

13:49.429 --> 13:50.528
on Facebook
once in awhile.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.931
Wow. Analyzing me
through Facebook.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.200
Is this some new
therapy tactic that

13:55.202 --> 13:56.034
I'm unaware of, or...

13:56.036 --> 13:58.002
Whoa! Don't get
so defensive, okay?

13:58.004 --> 13:58.503
We barely talk.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.438
I haven't seen you
in forever, and, look,

14:00.440 --> 14:02.373
I'm just... I'm doing
the best I can

14:02.375 --> 14:04.976
to avoid the fact
that Max is dead, okay?

14:04.978 --> 14:05.577
Consider it small talk.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.545
Yes. This is a very
fucked-up situation,

14:07.547 --> 14:10.415
but do not dodge
the fact that you didn't

14:10.417 --> 14:11.049
call me either.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.417
I was kind of busy
getting my doctorate.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.185
It's not like you were
waiting by the phone.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.422
Oh please You're a psychologist
You're barely a doctor.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.556
How does that
even make sense?

14:18.558 --> 14:21.626
I was just saying I'm glad you
found a guy, you know?

14:21.628 --> 14:22.927
When did this
become a fight?

14:22.929 --> 14:25.063
You know, I moved away
because I didn't want

14:25.065 --> 14:26.197
to talk about
my past to anybody.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.933
And I do not post my love
life on the Internet.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.602
Okay. Well, now we're here,

14:30.604 --> 14:33.204
and maybe, you know,
somebody's gonna ask you

14:33.206 --> 14:34.005
what you've been up to,

14:34.007 --> 14:36.307
because they haven't seen you
in a while. I'm sorry.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.177
Let's just pretend that we're
here for our brother's funeral

14:39.179 --> 14:41.512
and not talk
about my personal life.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.113
Please?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.215
Fine. I won't bring it up.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.516
Feel my base. See that?

14:45.518 --> 14:47.352
That's...
That's a strong base.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.087
See what I'm saying?
Yeah.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.422
Yeah.
Put your arms around.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.528
God, I hate that smell.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.098
So do bad spirits.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.334
Hello?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.637
Hi. Can we help you?

15:05.639 --> 15:07.605
No, I got this.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.941
Are you
baby Ashley?

15:09.943 --> 15:11.075
Hi, Grandpa.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.944
Yes, Dad.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.212
That's
your granddaughter.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.215
Heh heh heh.
Come here.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.349
Look at you.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.984
You're so beautiful.

15:19.986 --> 15:20.485
Heh. Thanks.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.086
I'm sorry.
I gotta sit down.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.657
Yes. Time flies when you
never see each other.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.692
Time goes slow
when your family

15:27.694 --> 15:29.294
doesn't come to see you.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.195
What are you doing?

15:31.197 --> 15:34.332
Your hair
is so beautiful.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.400
Um, Dad?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.335
Yeah. Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.569
Uh, who are you?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.338
I'm Faye.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.006
She's my nurse.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.376
So, anyone else
here yet?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.577
You're the last.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.313
Where's your wife?

15:48.315 --> 15:51.516
Did she think the death
of a family member

15:51.518 --> 15:52.717
wasn't important enough?

15:52.719 --> 15:55.153
She doesn't think
it's important to mourn

15:55.155 --> 15:55.720
or celebrate suicide.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.956
Magnus did not
kill himself.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.958
All right,
relax, kiddo.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.726
He's with the spirits now.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.595
Okay? He's in
a much better place.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.763
Okay.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.497
And who are you

16:06.499 --> 16:07.565
in relation
to any of this?

16:07.567 --> 16:10.401
I'm Faye!
Your father's nurse.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.704
All right, you know, Faye is
someone who knows more

16:12.706 --> 16:15.440
about what was going
on here than you, pal.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.442
Oh, yeah?
How's that work?

16:17.444 --> 16:19.010
Magnus died here.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.311
Where?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.547
He was living here.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.414
Ugh!

16:23.416 --> 16:25.149
How long are
these people

16:25.151 --> 16:26.184
gonna be surrounding the house?

16:26.186 --> 16:29.587
I could really use a StarBees
right about now.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.321
Don.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.156
Hey,
you're here.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.691
Little Ash.
Hi, Uncle Barry.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.293
You're all grown up.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.262
It's Ashley.
Ashley.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.098
Hey, guys!

16:40.100 --> 16:40.732
Hey.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.134
Well, you look healthy.

16:43.136 --> 16:43.634
Yeah, yeah.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.136
Lost some weight.
Feeling good.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.071
Thanks
to this guy.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.008
This is my boyfriend Makewi.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.175
M-Makoowi?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.410
Makewi.
Ah.

16:52.412 --> 16:55.580
Is that a skirt?

16:55.582 --> 16:58.249
Oh, my God.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.317
Baby Ashley.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.552
This is crazy.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.088
We look like
we're the same age.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.124
Hey, Jo.
Hey, Don.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.659
Oh, I'm... I'm Pete,
by the way.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.627
Yeah. This is Pete.
Sorry.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.762
Yeah. So...

17:11.765 --> 17:16.200
Well, here we are
all together.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.803
Yeah, we are all here.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.406
You know what? I want to take
a picture of this.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.174
Can you guys
just come together?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.608
Yeah.
I'm just gonna...

17:24.611 --> 17:27.045
I am
very confused.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.311
Okay. Ready, and...

17:28.314 --> 17:29.647
got it. Just beautiful.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.381
Just beautiful.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.617
Are you fucking kidding me?
Who are you?

17:32.619 --> 17:33.418
Did she take it?

17:33.420 --> 17:34.685
It was
a mental picture.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.421
So I... I wish
that all you guys

17:36.423 --> 17:39.557
were here together under
better circumstances.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.858
Oh, yeah, do you?

17:40.860 --> 17:44.829
Oh, Dad just told me that, um,
Max was living here.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.764
Wait. What do you mean
he was living here?

17:46.766 --> 17:50.068
You could've said that when
you called, Dad.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.335
Woody?
All right, look.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.304
I need to explain
something to you guys

17:53.306 --> 17:56.207
before you blow this
out of proportion.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.312
So I want to talk
to the three of you

18:01.314 --> 18:02.713
upstairs in the attic.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.415
Five minutes.

18:05.217 --> 18:08.052
Why does he need
to see me?

18:08.720 --> 18:09.287
Kiwi.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.788
He just said me.
He pointed at me.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.458
No. No, he didn't
point at you.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.543
I don't know, Dave.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.612
When I figure it out,
I will call you.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.381
Yes. I have to be here
for a couple days.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.116
Donald, Donald!

18:38.118 --> 18:39.517
...back in the office
as soon as I can.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.185
All right. I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.387
Dad, what the hell did I say
about my paintings?

18:43.389 --> 18:44.755
You have no right
to do this.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.091
I didn't do it.
Magnus did.

18:49.561 --> 18:53.664
I hid this
when the cops came.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.500
Just a collection
of his thoughts,

18:55.502 --> 18:59.103
some poetry,
things like that. It...

18:59.371 --> 19:01.139
I just felt like it
was important to him.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.573
I didn't want the cops
to have it.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.876
Great. Now we're
withholding evidence.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.144
They took everything
they needed.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.146
Dad, you have
to take these down.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.181
I can't.
I want to keep...

19:10.183 --> 19:14.452
everything the way
it was when he left it.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.255
How long
did he stay here?

19:17.556 --> 19:19.223
He came back
six months ago.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.726
And you didn't
tell any of us?

19:21.728 --> 19:24.295
- He wasn't ready yet.
- Ready?

19:25.264 --> 19:26.497
Yeah.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.204
This is my father,
Woodrow.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.306
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Come here.

19:35.308 --> 19:35.673
Hi.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.909
Come in. Come in.
Come in. Come in.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.343
You got it.
Thank you.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.379
I have so much
to tell you.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.289
When they left
the Viking colony,

19:51.291 --> 19:53.291
his girlfriend,
she was having

19:53.293 --> 19:54.692
a hard time adjusting.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.461
She soon relapsed.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.631
She couldn't handle it.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.511
She died.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.686
I'm so scared.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.387
It's all right.

20:48.880 --> 20:54.318
Jo, he said your paintings
inspired him to write.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.538
Magnus tried
to stay sober...

21:16.041 --> 21:18.909
but the drugs overtook him.

21:23.915 --> 21:29.020
He kissed me on the cheek,
and he left.

21:30.756 --> 21:31.422
He came back

21:31.424 --> 21:34.558
because he wanted us
to be a family again.

21:34.926 --> 21:37.828
He wanted to be the glue
like your mom was,

21:37.830 --> 21:39.730
and now I want that, too.

21:39.732 --> 21:44.035
He said that these pictures
reminded him of you guys.

22:31.650 --> 22:32.950
So how's school?

22:32.952 --> 22:35.019
It's good.

22:35.987 --> 22:39.824
Um, I have a 4.1 GPA.

22:39.826 --> 22:40.791
Oh.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.727
Yeah.
I was the first female

22:42.729 --> 22:44.595
to ever
go undefeated in CIF

22:44.597 --> 22:45.396
championship tennis,

22:45.398 --> 22:48.132
and I founded my school
Young Republicans club.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.601
Should have my pick
of any college

22:50.603 --> 22:51.135
in the country.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.537
Mm-hmm. We are
very proud of her.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.406
Did you go to college?

22:55.408 --> 22:56.807
Uh, no. I, uh...
I got my G.E.D.,

22:56.809 --> 22:58.376
and then I started
taking some art classes.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.811
But, uh, you know, I realized
there's more to life

23:00.813 --> 23:02.947
than just sitting
in a classroom,

23:02.949 --> 23:04.715
learning things.
Most of the stuff

23:04.717 --> 23:06.784
you could just look up on the
Internet anyways, right?

23:06.786 --> 23:09.520
Can't learn how to be a doctor
from the Internet.

23:09.522 --> 23:12.089
Yeah, but you're not
really a doctor, Barry.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.424
Yes, I am.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.626
No, come on. You're like a
glorified social worker.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.095
Actually, Bear Cub
is a very good doctor.

23:18.097 --> 23:21.699
I would still be addicted to
Oxy if it wasn't for him.

23:21.701 --> 23:22.400
Thank you.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.101
Oh, he nursed you
back to health?

23:24.103 --> 23:24.902
So you're a nurse.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.871
Except you have sex
with your patients.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.606
You're a naughty nurse.

23:28.608 --> 23:29.974
Son, play nice.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.942
I think you might need a sesh
with Dr. Burwood.

23:31.944 --> 23:35.179
Don't call him that.
Don't call him that.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.714
That's my name.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.115
Isn't this fun,

23:38.117 --> 23:40.551
having the whole gang
back together?

23:40.553 --> 23:42.820
Yeah,
so far apart.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.021
You have something
to say, Barry?

23:44.023 --> 23:46.023
No, Dad, I think he's just
observing your...

23:46.025 --> 23:48.893
Your sudden and
spontaneous attempt

23:48.895 --> 23:49.895
at fatherhood.

23:49.896 --> 23:50.861
How am I doing?

23:50.863 --> 23:52.129
You're doing great.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.899
Eh, sudden,
spontaneous.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.738
So, uh, Jo, are you
gonna see Johnny

24:00.740 --> 24:02.106
while you're here?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.207
Uh...

24:03.209 --> 24:04.475
that's really random.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.410
Why would I do that?

24:06.845 --> 24:09.180
Wait a minute.
Who's Johnny?

24:09.182 --> 24:10.481
Oh! "Johnny" Johnny.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.949
Oh, good call,
Bear Cub.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.218
Yeah, you guys
must have a lot

24:14.220 --> 24:15.453
to catch up on.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.020
Who's Johnny?

24:16.022 --> 24:17.588
Thanks a lot,
Barry, really.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.656
Are we...
Are we done here?

24:18.658 --> 24:22.793
Oh, is Johnny the guy you
were gonna have a baby with?

24:22.795 --> 24:24.795
Excuse me?

24:24.797 --> 24:27.932
Well, my dad said you had an
abortion. Is that the guy?

24:27.934 --> 24:29.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.668
Is this appropriate
dinner conversation?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.603
Well, I don't keep secrets
from my daughter.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.605
Secrets aren't something you
blurt out at dinner.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.608
Well, it's already out, so it's
not technically a secret.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.811
Johana did what she
had to do. She left.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.747
It's nothing that the rest
of you didn't do.

24:43.749 --> 24:46.817
Dad, I left
because I started a family,

24:46.819 --> 24:47.518
my own family.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.787
Okay?
No one abandoned you.

24:49.789 --> 24:50.988
No, but you stopped
talking to me.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.223
You stopped talking
to each other.

24:52.225 --> 24:55.526
All I'm saying is we haven't
seen each other for years.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.628
Let's just
try not to spoil it.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.529
It is just amazing

24:58.531 --> 25:00.531
how you can put yourself
on a pedestal like that,

25:00.533 --> 25:02.566
the fact that you
have the gall

25:02.568 --> 25:04.134
to point your finger
at any of us.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.604
Dad, it was not our job
to support you.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.738
You were the dad.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.740
Where were you
when we lost Mom?

25:09.742 --> 25:11.275
No, no.
It took the death

25:11.277 --> 25:12.543
of our little brother,

25:12.545 --> 25:16.146
who we hardly even knew,
till you realize

25:16.148 --> 25:18.249
that you actually did
a really shitty job.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.950
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just wondering

25:19.952 --> 25:22.186
when you're gonna start
taking responsibility

25:22.188 --> 25:24.054
for your own shit
instead of

25:24.056 --> 25:24.922
blaming it
all on me.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.558
I mean we did pretty much
raise ourselves, Dad.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.261
Thank you.
Just saying.

25:30.263 --> 25:31.962
Yeah.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.131
Forget it.

25:34.566 --> 25:38.302
Well, the food is,
um, fantastic.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.069
It is!
Yeah.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.971
Thank you
for the hospitality.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.207
Thank you, Pete.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.241
So, Ashley,

25:44.243 --> 25:47.211
are there any cute
boys at school?

25:48.647 --> 25:49.980
I guess.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.782
But how 'bout
anyone special, you know?

25:51.784 --> 25:54.018
Any hummingbirds coming
to feed at your nectar?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.820
Please, Dad. Can you...
Can you rein this in?

25:56.822 --> 25:58.289
It's natural.

25:58.291 --> 25:59.323
Heh.

25:59.325 --> 26:02.192
Is... Is this proper
dinner conversation?

26:02.194 --> 26:03.561
Are you fucking
kidding me?

26:03.563 --> 26:04.194
Okay, as...
Really?

26:04.196 --> 26:05.963
As a matter of fact,
I am a virgin,

26:05.965 --> 26:07.765
if that's what
you guys are asking.

26:07.767 --> 26:08.966
Good.
I'm waiting for marriage

26:08.968 --> 26:12.002
so I don't have
to abort anyone.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.837
Oh, wow.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.205
- Wow.
- Okay, well, um,

26:15.207 --> 26:18.175
Ashley, did you know that
your dad had you at 17

26:18.177 --> 26:19.910
and was forced
to get married?

26:19.912 --> 26:22.713
Yeah. I teach her not to make
the same mistakes I did.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.548
Okay. Well, I'm... I'm in the
middle of a conversation

26:24.550 --> 26:26.817
with your mistake right now, bu
t
according to her rights,

26:26.819 --> 26:28.719
Jo can do whatever
the hell she wants.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.820
Barry, where is
this going?

26:29.822 --> 26:32.756
Honestly, Uncle Dr. Barry,
do you really think

26:32.758 --> 26:35.192
you're the right candidate
to speak for the subject?

26:35.194 --> 26:38.996
I mean, you people
can't even have kids.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.631
What do you mean
me people?

26:40.633 --> 26:41.332
Don't. Just don't.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.300
I mean, once we've
allowed same-sex marriage,

26:43.302 --> 26:46.170
who's to say you can't go out
there and marry your car

26:46.172 --> 26:48.939
or, like, a dog
or something?

26:49.642 --> 26:50.708
I think I would
have a hard time

26:50.710 --> 26:53.210
consummating the relationship I
have with my car.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.746
Yeah, but what if he did? Would
you slap a ring on him?

26:55.748 --> 26:58.182
I'm not gonna have
a political conversation

26:58.184 --> 26:59.216
with a narrow-minded
13-year-old

26:59.218 --> 27:02.820
who's comparing people to autom
-
obiles and canines.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.822
I'm 15.
Yeah.

27:04.824 --> 27:05.789
So, when's the funeral?

27:05.791 --> 27:08.759
Oh, stop it
right now.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.094
I'm fucking serious.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.762
We're here
for your brother.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.163
I really
don't give a fuck

27:13.165 --> 27:16.166
whether you
like each other

27:16.168 --> 27:17.368
or me or not,

27:17.370 --> 27:18.235
but only for one week,

27:18.237 --> 27:21.372
I fucking implore you to get
along with each other

27:21.374 --> 27:23.073
for the sake
of your brother.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.809
And then we can all go back to
our pathetic lives,

27:25.811 --> 27:29.346
which I am
obviously to blame for.

27:33.018 --> 27:34.852
Your dad's right.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.321
This is wrong.

27:38.089 --> 27:41.358
I feel like we should say a
prayer for Magnus.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.459
Maxwell?

27:42.461 --> 27:43.727
Magnus.

27:43.729 --> 27:46.130
Whatever.

27:46.364 --> 27:48.866
Please grab
your neighbor's hand.

27:48.868 --> 27:49.433
Finally.

27:49.435 --> 27:52.703
The energy in here
was so damp, man.

27:52.705 --> 27:53.370
Nah, I'm okay.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.873
Don.
We don't need him.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.174
You don't need me either.
It's... Okay.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.909
I don't think I can
do this either. Sorry.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.045
All right.
Well, you all can watch.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.447
You can keep your eyes
closed or open,

28:03.449 --> 28:07.284
but please make sure to keep
your soul open.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.054
Wow. Wow.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.024
You know, aloha means
hello, goodbye,

28:47.026 --> 28:50.761
but it also means love.

28:54.332 --> 28:56.366
Will you
please relax?

28:56.368 --> 28:58.168
No. I have anxiety.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.169
Pacing helps me
calm myself.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.338
What the hell would
you have anxiety for?

29:01.340 --> 29:03.474
Because your whole family
hates each other.

29:03.476 --> 29:05.342
I told you
we don't get along.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.844
Yeah, but I thought
you were talking about,

29:06.846 --> 29:08.512
like, the way a man
gets mad at his wife

29:08.514 --> 29:09.880
for stepping
in front of the game

29:09.882 --> 29:11.782
or... or fighting over
which channel to watch.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.350
Pete,
you wanted to come.

29:13.352 --> 29:16.220
Look, I never said that I
wanted to leave, okay?

29:16.222 --> 29:17.988
I really like
being here with you.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.125
I just sometimes
need to vent and pace

29:21.127 --> 29:22.793
to get stuff out.

29:22.795 --> 29:23.795
Okay.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.830
And who's Johnny,
by the way?

29:26.832 --> 29:29.099
He's just a boyfriend
from high school.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.835
Well, then why did everything
escalate as soon as it

29:31.837 --> 29:32.269
was broug ht up?

29:32.271 --> 29:34.238
It escalated because
my brothers are dicks.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.339
Are you sure?
Yes.

29:35.341 --> 29:38.142
Because if you need to, like,
go and see that Johnny guy

29:38.144 --> 29:40.144
for any reason,
to, like, bury any hatchets

29:40.146 --> 29:41.912
or, anything, you totally can.
I get it.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.514
Why would I care?
Why would I do that?

29:43.516 --> 29:45.015
There's no hatchet
to bury, you know.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.451
I haven't talked to the guy in,
like, almost five years.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.253
Yeah. But you're
here now, right?

29:49.255 --> 29:50.788
Look, the guy
was a dickhead.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.590
I dumped him,
and I left.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.363
Do you guys want to go
grab some cocktails?

29:59.365 --> 30:00.230
No.

30:00.232 --> 30:00.998
Yes, please.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.200
Can you give us
a minute?

30:08.206 --> 30:10.474
Listen, Jo.

30:11.409 --> 30:13.310
I like you, okay?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.312
But I'm not down
for getting into this

30:15.314 --> 30:17.014
if you have
any unfinished business.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.016
That's all I'm saying.

30:18.017 --> 30:21.418
You have nothing
to worry about, okay?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.253
Okay.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.490
I need a drink.

30:40.438 --> 30:43.240
Don, you sure you don't
want to come with us?

30:43.242 --> 30:45.042
No, I'm good.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.510
Okay.

30:48.079 --> 30:50.080
See you guys later.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.015
Have fun.
Yep.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.523
You know, you're
not better than us.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.326
One brother is
a suicidal drug addict,

31:02.328 --> 31:04.862
the other is
a therapist who bangs

31:04.864 --> 31:05.562
his male patients,

31:05.564 --> 31:07.397
and my sister
is a coward.

31:07.399 --> 31:10.234
My daughter and I
live a normal and

31:10.236 --> 31:11.335
comfortable life.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.103
That's why I am better.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.972
Ah, you sound like
the perfect big brother,

31:14.974 --> 31:17.374
comfortable with putting
everybody else down.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.643
And your comfortable life
with your wife

31:19.645 --> 31:22.646
who doesn't support
her husband during

31:22.648 --> 31:24.448
his time of grief.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.317
Who says I'm grieving?

31:27.319 --> 31:28.986
You do.

31:29.387 --> 31:34.458
Look, why don't you
buy a few rounds

31:34.460 --> 31:38.228
and say that
you paid for it?

31:42.166 --> 31:43.901
Ah.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.168
All right,
will you back off?

31:45.170 --> 31:47.204
All right? I am trying
to concentrate here

31:47.206 --> 31:50.407
and focus on some quality
time with my daughter,

31:50.409 --> 31:52.910
who is kicking my ass.

31:52.912 --> 31:55.145
Have one for Magnus.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.982
It's okay, Dad.
You can go.

31:58.984 --> 31:59.583
Really?

31:59.585 --> 32:01.285
Yeah. I'm fine.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.319
Yeah. See?
She's fine.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.955
She and Faye can sit around and
talk about creation

32:04.957 --> 32:07.591
or pollination or
something like that.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.360
See what you're
getting yourself into?

32:10.362 --> 32:12.462
I'm into it.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.531
Fine.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.700
Oh, hey, can I
borrow your car?

32:16.702 --> 32:18.602
Mine's got
so much shit in it.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.671
I'm driving.

32:20.673 --> 32:21.405
Attaboy!

32:21.407 --> 32:24.074
I can see your nipples through
your shirt, by the way.

32:24.076 --> 32:27.644
Oh, wait. Should I change?
I don't...

32:34.185 --> 32:38.689
I thought you didn't
like drinking.

32:38.691 --> 32:41.258
No, I'm just
a self-medicating drunk.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.026
I drink
when I'm anxious.

32:43.028 --> 32:44.227
All right, come on.

32:44.229 --> 32:45.195
Why are you pushing me?

32:45.197 --> 32:47.431
I'm gonna go
to the little girls' room.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.700
You and Don talk.
Don's in finance.

32:49.702 --> 32:53.303
I'm sure you guys will have
a lot to talk about.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.442
So, what do you do
for a living?

32:58.444 --> 33:00.544
Mm.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.115
I live life.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.751
Yeah, that's...
That's fantastic.

33:07.753 --> 33:10.520
Pete, you really
need to calm down.

33:10.522 --> 33:11.154
Hey, bartender!

33:11.156 --> 33:12.622
Whoa, dude.
What are you doing?

33:12.624 --> 33:13.490
I need a refill.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.358
Uh, no, you don't.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.526
Look, I'm just trying
to get on your guys' level.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.329
Well, you don't see the rest of
us getting wasted.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.297
No, that's what I mean.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.233
I... I need to get drunk
to fit in.

33:23.235 --> 33:24.534
Okay. Stop being
such a baby.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.302
Okay, Jo.
Okay.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.738
You, uh, lovebirds
need a couple refills?

33:27.740 --> 33:30.540
No, we're... Shit.

33:32.176 --> 33:32.976
Johana?

33:32.978 --> 33:36.146
Hi there, Johnny.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.280
That's Johnny?

33:37.282 --> 33:38.648
Yeah.
I'm Johnny.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.651
Pete, Johnny.
Johnny, Pete.

33:42.253 --> 33:43.387
I need
two refills, please.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.155
What were you drinking?
No, you don't.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.590
Are you his mother?

33:46.592 --> 33:48.091
No, I am not.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.193
She's my girlfriend.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.364
Yeah, actually.
Um...

33:54.366 --> 33:55.632
this is
my boyfriend,

33:55.634 --> 33:58.068
and my boyfriend
and I need to go.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.404
Well, congratulations
to the both of you.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.571
Next round's on me.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.507
No, no, no. We're fine.
We have a table.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.243
No, no, no, no.
You heard the man.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.678
The next round
is on Big John.

34:08.679 --> 34:09.279
Yeah.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.648
Jo, I'm so sorry
about your brother.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.449
Thank you, but, uh,

34:13.452 --> 34:16.753
we really have to get going.
Come on.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.391
Nice seeing you, too.

34:28.132 --> 34:28.697
Where's Barry?

34:28.699 --> 34:30.600
He went
to the Boom Boom Room.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.235
Well, we should
get going.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.103
Yes, please.
Yeah.

34:33.105 --> 34:35.272
Why are you
sitting down?

34:35.274 --> 34:36.806
Hey. Ho.
Coming through.

34:36.809 --> 34:40.210
More free drinks!

34:40.212 --> 34:41.378
One for Magnus.
Mm-mm.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.512
Keep 'em
coming.

34:42.514 --> 34:43.847
Why do I have
the feeling

34:43.849 --> 34:45.748
like you're trying
to keep us here?

34:45.751 --> 34:47.751
What? Who, me? No.
Mm-hmm.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.351
What,
you know this guy?

34:49.353 --> 34:51.487
I'm Johnny, man.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.422
Don, right?

34:52.424 --> 34:55.391
Heh. Hey!
Hey.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.359
Hey, Johnny!

34:56.360 --> 34:57.727
How are ya, pal?
I'm good.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.129
Yeah?
I'm real good. Yeah.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.131
Wow. It's so funny,

35:00.132 --> 35:02.099
'cause we were just talking
about you over dinner.

35:02.101 --> 35:04.701
Only lovely things,
I'm sure.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.303
Eh.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.872
Hey, I'm so sorry
to hear about

35:08.874 --> 35:09.806
your brother.

35:09.808 --> 35:10.574
Oh. I know. I know.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.210
It'll make a great movie
of the week, though, right?

35:13.212 --> 35:16.646
Okay. Well, we're
gonna get going,

35:16.648 --> 35:18.248
so you should, too.

35:18.250 --> 35:21.852
Well, that bathroom was
a treat, let me tell ya.

35:21.854 --> 35:22.786
Holy shit!

35:22.788 --> 35:24.621
We got the whole
Burwood bunch.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.124
All right. I'm gonna be
waiting in the car.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.326
Thanks, Johnny.
Great to see you, kid.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.695
Johnny, hey.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.263
Dude, you look so fit.

35:33.265 --> 35:36.733
Yeah, I lost
some weight.

35:36.735 --> 35:37.834
Yeah.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.469
Hey, I'm really sorry,

35:39.471 --> 35:42.572
uh, that I was such a dick to
you in high school.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.673
Right. Right.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.276
You know, life's gotten
a lot better.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.310
I'm a doctor now.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.312
Wow. That's...
That is cool.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.247
Yeah.
Yeah.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.748
Not a barkeep, so...

35:51.750 --> 35:53.550
It pays the bills.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.319
Does it pay the bills?

35:58.222 --> 36:00.457
He's also
in a relationship.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.291
Hi. I'm Makewi.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.426
Hey, there.
I'm John.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.362
Yes, you are.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.564
Great catching up
with you guys.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.166
Bye.
You, too, John.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.433
All right.

36:10.435 --> 36:11.902
Well, we should go.

36:11.904 --> 36:12.669
Let's go. Yeah.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.271
We should go.
Yeah, let's go.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.172
Yeah. Come on.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.640
Come on. Chop-chop.
Let's do this.

36:16.642 --> 36:20.210
I have a sicky
little boy here.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.381
All right.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.448
Do you need help?

36:25.450 --> 36:26.283
Watch his head.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.685
Oh, my God.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.420
Hey, Jo!

36:30.422 --> 36:32.556
Jojo!
Jojo?

36:32.558 --> 36:34.758
Johana?

36:34.760 --> 36:35.959
Yeah.

36:35.961 --> 36:39.563
Uh, I really am
sorry about Max.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.933
He was a, um,
very interesting guy

36:42.935 --> 36:46.603
from what I remember and
from what the news said.

36:46.605 --> 36:50.507
Yeah. Well, um,
you said sorry already.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.276
Hey.
You kidding me?

36:53.278 --> 36:53.743
I gotta go.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.613
Let me take you
to lunch tomorrow.

36:56.615 --> 36:57.214
No.

36:57.216 --> 37:01.218
Or coffee or tea
or boba, anything.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.486
Okay, come on, Jo.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.788
No phone call.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.456
No note.
You changed your number.

37:06.458 --> 37:09.326
I mean, you didn't
even give me a chance

37:09.328 --> 37:10.360
to be there for you.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.428
My brother
just died, okay?

37:11.430 --> 37:13.830
I really can't be dealing
with this right now.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.365
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.601
That's like the fourth time
you said that.

37:17.603 --> 37:18.635
Come on.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.704
I'm working at Cafe de Leche
tomorrow morning.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.405
Come on!
I gotta go.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.440
Come by, and see me.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.641
Coming!
Fuck.

37:24.643 --> 37:25.308
Finally.

37:25.310 --> 37:26.743
It's good
to meet you, bro.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.378
Bye, Johnny!

37:28.380 --> 37:30.880
You've got a good head of hair,
bro.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.656
Okay.

37:41.626 --> 37:43.660
And down.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.295
There you go.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.365
Sleeping beauty.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.367
Thanks, man.

37:49.368 --> 37:49.966
No worries.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.302
I guess I'll be going.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.036
Yeah, go.
Yeah.

37:53.038 --> 37:54.671
Do you need
anything else?

37:54.673 --> 37:55.405
You're good?

37:55.407 --> 37:57.507
No, I... I think
I got it from here.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.476
Okay. Mahalo.

37:59.478 --> 38:00.543
Mahalo.

38:00.545 --> 38:01.678
Mahalo.

38:03.114 --> 38:03.880
Maha...

38:03.882 --> 38:05.749
Mahalo.
Okay.

38:05.751 --> 38:09.986
Oh, I wanted
to give you something.

38:09.988 --> 38:10.553
Mm.

38:10.555 --> 38:14.958
Something for the edge,
little sista.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.360
Why not?

38:22.867 --> 38:24.501
Thank you.

38:28.572 --> 38:30.307
Jo?

38:30.309 --> 38:32.742
Hey. How you feeling?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.711
I'm sorry
I ruined your night.

38:34.713 --> 38:37.814
Ah, you didn't ruin
my night.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.683
Really?

38:39.685 --> 38:42.319
Okay.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.888
I'm gonna go wash up.

38:46.724 --> 38:47.824
Hey, Jo.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.958
Hmm?

38:50.428 --> 38:52.429
I like you.

38:53.597 --> 38:55.332
Heh.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.650
Hello?

40:21.852 --> 40:23.686
Hey. Hey.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.490
You smell pot?

40:27.725 --> 40:29.692
Oh, what, are you
a pothead now, too?

40:29.694 --> 40:31.828
What is the matter
with you people?

40:31.830 --> 40:34.197
What are you
doing up here, Don?

40:34.199 --> 40:35.199
I smelled pot.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.833
Just relax, please.

40:36.835 --> 40:40.103
Yeah. Well, the whole house
smells like weed.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.038
Who gives a shit?!

40:44.575 --> 40:45.742
You crying?

40:45.744 --> 40:46.876
No.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.612
Yeah, you are.

40:49.614 --> 40:50.547
You okay?

40:50.549 --> 40:53.783
Yeah, I'm f-fine.

40:56.588 --> 40:57.153
Ugh.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.522
No wonder you're crying.

40:59.524 --> 41:00.957
This is disturbing.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.192
Jesus.

41:02.194 --> 41:04.194
Well, I'm no Dr. Barry,

41:04.196 --> 41:07.564
but I can tell you
this artist has issues.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.598
Thanks.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.868
Is that supposed to be Mom?

41:11.870 --> 41:13.203
I guess.

41:13.205 --> 41:14.571
And you're the baby?

41:14.573 --> 41:15.905
I don't know.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.207
I don't remember.

41:17.209 --> 41:17.874
Is that me?

41:17.876 --> 41:21.444
The one in the dress
and the little nightie?

41:23.981 --> 41:26.616
Looks like you had
some unfinished business

41:26.618 --> 41:28.218
with that guy, Johnny.

41:30.855 --> 41:32.188
Oh, shit.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.523
Is that supposed
to be your baby?

41:33.525 --> 41:35.058
I don't know.
I don't know why

41:35.060 --> 41:36.893
everyone cares
so much about this.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.027
You know, please...

41:38.029 --> 41:38.761
Okay. Okay.

41:38.763 --> 41:40.663
Hey, I'm still
your older brother.

41:40.665 --> 41:41.998
I don't know.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.134
Are you fucking with me
or something, Don?

41:45.136 --> 41:47.770
'Cause it's not funny.

41:48.706 --> 41:51.207
We weren't
always this shitty

41:51.209 --> 41:53.710
to each other, right?

41:56.714 --> 41:59.816
Remember when
you were little and sweet

41:59.818 --> 42:00.250
and innocent

42:00.252 --> 42:03.520
and followed me around
like a little puppy dog?

42:03.522 --> 42:04.721
I'm not a puppy anymore.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.990
Yeah. What happened?

42:06.992 --> 42:10.727
Heh. I grew tits,
and you're an asshole.

42:12.197 --> 42:15.532
You know what?
I am gonna commission

42:15.534 --> 42:17.867
a whole new line of work,

42:17.869 --> 42:19.102
still lifes.

42:19.104 --> 42:22.305
I want something happier,
like a nice bowl of fruit.

42:22.307 --> 42:25.241
Slap a smile and
some eyeballs on there for me.

42:25.243 --> 42:27.944
I'd buy that, put that
in my living room.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.546
No, you know
who'd buy that? Barry.

42:29.548 --> 42:32.849
Barry'd buy the shit out
of that. Heh.

42:33.183 --> 42:36.986
I just want to know
what Max was doing

42:36.988 --> 42:38.955
with all these
up here.

42:38.957 --> 42:40.256
Yeah.

42:40.258 --> 42:41.991
Who knows?

42:41.993 --> 42:44.027
Read the book.

42:44.029 --> 42:46.829
Let me know
when you figure it out.

42:46.831 --> 42:47.964
Yeah.

42:48.999 --> 42:51.734
Oh, hey. You know, if you ever
need to have a session,

42:51.736 --> 42:55.238
you want to gab
about Mommy and Johnny

42:55.240 --> 42:57.340
and, you know, whatever,

42:57.342 --> 42:59.275
my door is always open.

42:59.277 --> 43:01.611
I'm twice
as expensive as Barry,

43:01.613 --> 43:03.713
but only half as helpful.

43:03.715 --> 43:05.915
Heh.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.250
Thanks, Don.

43:07.252 --> 43:07.984
Good night.

43:07.986 --> 43:11.220
Try not to smoke
too much of that shit.

43:35.013 --> 43:36.379
Honey, honey,
honey, honey,

43:36.381 --> 43:38.081
honey, honey.
No, please.

43:38.083 --> 43:38.915
Please stop, okay?

43:38.917 --> 43:39.882
It's 7:00
in the morning.

43:39.884 --> 43:41.618
We went to bed,
like, four hours ago.

43:41.620 --> 43:44.087
No. You went to bed
four hours ago,

43:44.089 --> 43:45.388
my little bear cub.

43:45.390 --> 43:46.356
I was working.

43:46.358 --> 43:48.391
On what?
What are you building?

43:48.393 --> 43:49.726
An ark.

43:49.728 --> 43:51.094
An ark.

43:51.096 --> 43:51.661
Why?

43:51.663 --> 43:53.296
Because something
told me to.

43:53.298 --> 43:56.099
Because something told you to.
Okay, great.

43:56.101 --> 43:56.866
Hey!
Oh, God.

43:56.868 --> 43:59.102
Do you fruits have any idea
wha t time it is?

43:59.104 --> 44:00.803
Yes. Yes, we do.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.805
What is
he doing?

44:02.807 --> 44:05.675
He's building an ark.

44:05.677 --> 44:07.076
He's building
an ark?

44:07.078 --> 44:08.211
Yeah.

44:08.213 --> 44:09.012
What the fuck for?

44:09.014 --> 44:10.213
Because something
told him to.

44:10.215 --> 44:13.049
Ah. You are a really
good doctor, man.

44:13.051 --> 44:14.350
All right.
Fuck off, Don.

44:14.352 --> 44:16.386
No! No! No!

44:16.388 --> 44:18.287
Hey! What did you
do that for?

44:18.289 --> 44:20.890
Sleep!

44:20.892 --> 44:22.959
How high are you?

44:22.961 --> 44:24.827
So this is coming
from our yard?

44:24.829 --> 44:26.362
What's going on?

44:26.364 --> 44:27.063
Okay, look.

44:27.065 --> 44:29.365
I couldn't sleep
last night, yeah?

44:29.367 --> 44:30.700
So, I was
really hungry,

44:30.702 --> 44:33.302
so I started to eat some mushro
-
oms that I brought from home.

44:33.304 --> 44:36.105
You know, mushrooms,
magic mushrooms. I ate 'em.

44:36.107 --> 44:37.173
They were really good.

44:37.175 --> 44:39.008
Okay. Fuck this.
I am going to bed.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.076
And I started to trip out,

44:40.078 --> 44:42.378
and I wanted
to go for a walk,

44:42.380 --> 44:43.813
so I went for a walk.

44:43.815 --> 44:44.881
And then
I don't know why,

44:44.883 --> 44:46.282
but I found myself
in this abandoned ware...

44:46.284 --> 44:49.786
Like, it was like a constructio
n
site or something.

44:49.788 --> 44:50.853
And it was this vision,

44:50.855 --> 44:54.157
and... and something said,
"You have to build

44:54.159 --> 44:54.757
this ark."

44:54.759 --> 44:56.426
Are your gums bleeding?

44:56.428 --> 45:00.229
No. I don't know
what it was,

45:00.231 --> 45:02.799
but something
deep in my soul,

45:02.801 --> 45:05.368
it was a color,
it was a feeling,

45:05.370 --> 45:06.836
it was something
that said,

45:06.838 --> 45:10.473
"Take this wood, Makewi,
and build the ark."

45:10.475 --> 45:13.710
Isn't this, like,
a bit small for an ark,

45:13.712 --> 45:14.477
in case of big flood or...

45:14.479 --> 45:16.112
I never said flood!
I never said flood!

45:16.114 --> 45:19.415
I said something told me to
build an ark, so I build an ark.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.250
I don't question
these things.

45:21.252 --> 45:23.219
All right,
Kiwi, relax.

45:24.188 --> 45:25.088
Hey!

45:25.090 --> 45:26.255
Okay.

45:26.257 --> 45:27.356
What's everyone
doing out here?

45:27.358 --> 45:30.426
Somebody please hide all the
power tools. Barry?

45:30.428 --> 45:32.161
I have this.

45:32.163 --> 45:33.062
Honey, you stole lumber.

45:33.064 --> 45:34.330
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.

45:34.332 --> 45:37.867
You know why it's bad to eat
mushrooms now, right?

45:37.869 --> 45:39.802
I say, "Whoo."

45:39.804 --> 45:40.970
Kiwi?

45:47.311 --> 45:51.781
"Alas, milady and I
are about to return

45:51.783 --> 45:52.849
to the Americas.

45:52.851 --> 45:56.119
A new journey awaits
in our homeland."

45:56.121 --> 45:58.187
Our rehabilitation was over,

45:58.189 --> 46:00.389
and it was time to face
the world ahead.

46:00.391 --> 46:04.827
These modern Vikings showed us
their tools of sobriety.

46:04.829 --> 46:08.164
Our life is no longer
controlled by substances.

46:08.166 --> 46:12.135
We've rid ourselves
of bad habits and vices,

46:12.137 --> 46:15.037
but I reckon to see
no difference between

46:15.039 --> 46:15.772
fantasy and reality.

46:15.774 --> 46:19.342
But a true Viking, no matter
how trapped he may feel,

46:19.344 --> 46:23.846
must face dragons head-on
no matter the consequence.

46:23.848 --> 46:25.782
This is the Viking way.

46:25.784 --> 46:28.484
Never give up.
Never submit.

46:28.486 --> 46:32.321
Never surrender to any man
or any thing.

46:50.474 --> 46:53.543
Where are you
sneaking out to?

46:57.147 --> 46:58.481
Is there more coffee?

46:58.483 --> 47:01.984
Sorry. I only made enough
for my dad and me.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.953
Of course.

47:03.955 --> 47:07.290
Here. Uh, take this.

47:09.393 --> 47:10.126
Really?

47:10.128 --> 47:13.596
Yeah. You can have it.

47:13.598 --> 47:15.198
Thanks.

47:17.167 --> 47:19.035
Oh, that is
way more sugar

47:19.037 --> 47:19.969
than I was expecting.

47:19.971 --> 47:22.505
Yeah, I don't like
the taste of coffee.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.073
Why the hell do
you drink it, then?

47:24.075 --> 47:26.175
I have an essay to finish.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.143
Oh, gosh. It is summer.

47:27.145 --> 47:29.612
Go... Go to the beach.
Hang out with boys.

47:29.614 --> 47:31.247
I don't have time
for boys.

47:31.249 --> 47:32.982
I want to get in to NYU,

47:32.984 --> 47:34.250
and everything needs
to be perfect.

47:34.252 --> 47:37.553
Heh. Don't you have,
like, a 4.0 GPA?

47:37.555 --> 47:39.121
Yeah, 4.1.

47:39.957 --> 47:41.490
Ashley, okay,

47:41.492 --> 47:43.993
try and enjoy
being a kid

47:43.995 --> 47:44.894
before it's
too late.

47:44.896 --> 47:47.263
Okay. Yeah, you had
a boyfriend in high school,

47:47.265 --> 47:49.498
and look how
that turned out.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.868
How did that turn out?

47:53.036 --> 47:54.570
Are you serious?

47:54.572 --> 47:57.106
Okay, who the fuck
do you think you are,

47:57.108 --> 47:57.807
little girl, huh?

47:57.809 --> 48:00.376
You have no idea what
you're talking about,

48:00.378 --> 48:02.144
and neither does
your asshole dad.

48:02.146 --> 48:04.347
Okay,
I was proving my point.

48:04.349 --> 48:05.047
Calm down.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.516
Well, that's none
of your business.

48:08.118 --> 48:10.486
One day, you might be faced wit
h
the same decision,

48:10.488 --> 48:12.288
so you shouldn't be
so quick to judge

48:12.290 --> 48:14.557
something you've
never gone through.

49:46.084 --> 49:46.983
Hello.

49:46.985 --> 49:48.184
One second.

49:48.186 --> 49:50.152
Okay.

49:52.657 --> 49:54.390
May I help you?

49:54.392 --> 49:56.459
Hi. Yeah, um...

49:56.461 --> 49:57.393
Tori.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.427
Yeah. Johana Burwood.

49:58.429 --> 50:01.497
I almost didn't recognize you
with the hair change.

50:01.499 --> 50:04.367
Oh, yeah. Well,
I guess people are right.

50:04.369 --> 50:06.335
Blondes have
a little too much fun.

50:06.337 --> 50:07.036
Oh, yeah.

50:07.038 --> 50:11.340
Well, you still look like
you're in high school.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.642
Thanks, I guess.

50:14.745 --> 50:16.579
Uh, who's
that little kid?

50:16.581 --> 50:17.780
Is he
someone's here?

50:17.782 --> 50:18.781
Is he bothering you?
No. No.

50:18.783 --> 50:21.083
Hunter, can you
come here, please? Now.

50:21.085 --> 50:21.584
Oh, he's yours.

50:21.586 --> 50:23.786
No, I just like
to yell at random kids.

50:23.788 --> 50:26.122
This is my son Hunter.

50:26.124 --> 50:27.390
Can you say hi?
Hi.

50:27.392 --> 50:29.058
Hi. I'm Jo. How old are... Okay,
Hunter,

50:29.060 --> 50:32.461
what did I say about
jumping up on the furniture?

50:32.463 --> 50:33.629
I don't know.

50:33.631 --> 50:34.697
Okay.
Can you go color

50:34.699 --> 50:36.499
in the back room,
please?

50:37.734 --> 50:39.168
Thank you.

50:40.570 --> 50:43.272
Can I get you
a coffee or a scone?

50:43.274 --> 50:44.473
No.

50:44.475 --> 50:49.045
Does, um...
Does Johnny work here?

50:49.047 --> 50:50.713
Why do you want
to know that?

50:50.715 --> 50:53.649
I just needed
to talk to...

50:56.620 --> 50:58.220
Is Hunter...

51:00.390 --> 51:01.557
Yeah.

51:04.327 --> 51:05.728
Nope.

51:05.730 --> 51:06.762
Uh, what the fuck,
John?

51:06.764 --> 51:08.531
How long does it take to
smoke a cigarette?

51:08.533 --> 51:10.199
Sorry.
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

51:10.201 --> 51:11.500
I said I'm sorry, Jo.

51:11.502 --> 51:13.235
Jo?
Tor... Tori.

51:13.237 --> 51:16.172
Don't you have
a bar to open?

51:16.174 --> 51:16.639
Fuck.

51:16.641 --> 51:18.507
You know, I'm gonna go.

51:18.509 --> 51:21.077
Yeah. Good idea.

51:21.711 --> 51:24.480
Are you fucking
kidding me?

51:27.317 --> 51:28.584
Hey, Jo, wait up.

51:28.586 --> 51:30.086
I have to go.

51:30.088 --> 51:30.519
What for?

51:30.521 --> 51:31.720
I shouldn't
have come here.

51:31.722 --> 51:34.123
I didn't know that you and
Tori were together.

51:34.125 --> 51:36.125
Seriously?
We're not married.

51:36.127 --> 51:37.093
Good for you.
Can I...

51:37.095 --> 51:39.261
I didn't even know
she was working today.

51:39.263 --> 51:43.599
Her parents own this place,
and I, uh,

51:43.601 --> 51:44.533
owe them money.

51:44.535 --> 51:47.336
And you have
a kid together.

51:47.338 --> 51:48.671
Yeah.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.639
Yeah. Can I get
my keys, please?

51:50.641 --> 51:53.509
I'm not gonna give you
the keys back until you

51:53.511 --> 51:54.577
tell me why you came.

51:54.579 --> 51:55.778
Okay. If I tell you why,

51:55.780 --> 51:58.481
will you
please let me leave?

51:59.249 --> 51:59.782
I pinky swear.

51:59.784 --> 52:01.884
I will just take
your word on that.

52:01.886 --> 52:02.618
Jesus, Jo.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.720
I don't understand
what you're so upset for.

52:04.722 --> 52:05.654
You came here to see me.

52:05.656 --> 52:08.357
I was going to tell you
the real reason I left,

52:08.359 --> 52:11.861
but I don't even care
if you know anymore.

52:11.863 --> 52:13.429
You had an abortion.

52:13.431 --> 52:14.431
You were ashamed.

52:14.432 --> 52:15.264
Everybody knows that.

52:15.266 --> 52:16.599
Yeah, everybody
doesn't know shit.

52:16.601 --> 52:18.601
Jo, if I knew you were
gonna leave after that,

52:18.603 --> 52:20.803
I would've said
we should have the baby

52:20.805 --> 52:24.206
if that meant me and you
staying together.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.442
I've missed you.

52:28.512 --> 52:31.347
Ah, man, we would've been
great together, huh?

52:31.349 --> 52:33.149
You can't just
fuck people's friends.

52:33.151 --> 52:36.285
You can't just get girls
pregnant like it's whatever.

52:36.287 --> 52:37.686
Tori was a mistake.
I... I was young.

52:37.688 --> 52:39.822
I fucked up when
I cheated on you, Jo.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.257
I'm paying for that now,
clearly.

52:41.259 --> 52:43.225
Yeah. Well, some things
you can't take back.

52:43.227 --> 52:44.827
You know, don't ruin
your kid's life

52:44.829 --> 52:47.196
because of some
stupid schoolboy crush.

52:47.198 --> 52:48.198
Crush?

52:48.199 --> 52:48.564
Yeah.

52:48.566 --> 52:50.499
Yeah. I was in love
with you, Jo.

52:50.501 --> 52:55.871
We would've had
a perfect life, huh?

52:55.873 --> 52:57.740
Just you and me.

52:58.575 --> 53:01.544
And our baby, Johnny.

53:02.813 --> 53:04.980
And our baby, whatever.

53:04.982 --> 53:07.283
Yeah, whatever.

53:07.285 --> 53:08.584
Fuck, Jo! I...

53:08.586 --> 53:10.186
thought we were
having a moment here.

53:10.188 --> 53:12.488
God, a moment? What the fuck
is wrong with you?

53:12.490 --> 53:15.291
You're a father. Go have a
moment with them.

53:15.293 --> 53:18.360
Just wait.
Wait a second.

53:19.362 --> 53:22.198
Okay, f-fuck it.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.539
This makes no sense.

53:30.541 --> 53:33.642
You are missing out,
Ash-flower.

53:33.644 --> 53:39.215
Sometimes you gotta just stop
and enjoy the scenery.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.387
Not my call.

53:54.265 --> 53:56.332
Just chill,
you know?

54:07.711 --> 54:10.546
What's wrong with you?

54:10.548 --> 54:11.380
Where have you been?

54:11.382 --> 54:13.849
Nowhere.
It's... It's nothing.

54:15.385 --> 54:16.318
Okay. Sure.

54:16.320 --> 54:17.920
You know, if you
would have just told me

54:17.922 --> 54:20.623
that you were gonna go talk to
him, I would've understood.

54:20.625 --> 54:22.992
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
give you a heads-up.

54:22.994 --> 54:26.895
He's still an asshole,
if that's you're wondering.

54:26.897 --> 54:29.932
Oh, fuck!
He's such an asshole!

54:29.934 --> 54:32.768
He's an asshole, huh?

54:35.773 --> 54:37.640
Damn it!

54:48.318 --> 54:49.585
Jo, are you okay?

54:50.354 --> 54:52.588
I sense some very negative
energy coming from here,

54:52.590 --> 54:55.724
and I just needed to make
sure you were okay.

54:55.726 --> 54:57.693
Yeah. I'm, uh...

54:57.695 --> 54:58.827
I'm good.

54:58.829 --> 55:00.663
Okay.

55:01.931 --> 55:03.032
What, are you changing?

55:03.034 --> 55:05.868
No, no, I'm packing.
This is a bag.

55:05.870 --> 55:08.704
But what about
the funeral?

55:11.308 --> 55:14.310
I should've
just stayed home.

55:14.312 --> 55:15.811
You know,
I come back here,

55:15.813 --> 55:19.848
and all this shit just picks up
where it left off.

55:20.450 --> 55:23.319
I'm gonna talk about me
for a second.

55:23.321 --> 55:27.723
You know,
I never really had a family

55:27.725 --> 55:30.859
until your dad
took me in.

55:31.361 --> 55:34.630
He's been
really nice to me.

55:34.632 --> 55:35.497
Yeah.

55:35.499 --> 55:36.799
Well, he's, uh...

55:36.801 --> 55:39.601
He's changing,
I guess.

55:39.603 --> 55:40.936
Heh.

55:40.938 --> 55:44.807
I think he pretends
I'm you guys.

55:44.809 --> 55:46.442
He misses you.

55:47.944 --> 55:51.714
It's not just him,
though, you know?

55:51.716 --> 55:56.518
It's...
It's this place.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.087
It's Max.

55:58.089 --> 56:01.824
It's every scar,
every bruise.

56:01.826 --> 56:04.960
You know,
every stupid fucking

56:04.962 --> 56:06.028
memory is...

56:06.030 --> 56:07.030
It's here.

56:07.031 --> 56:10.599
But if we didn't have
any of the bad stuff,

56:10.601 --> 56:13.435
then how could we
recognize the good?

56:13.437 --> 56:16.405
It would all
just be the same.

56:16.706 --> 56:20.709
Maybe they're preparing you
for something bigger.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.912
What, like, um...
Like a test?

56:23.914 --> 56:25.447
Yes!

56:26.383 --> 56:29.585
You should go catch Peter
and see if you pass.

56:29.587 --> 56:30.953
What do you mean
catch him?

56:30.955 --> 56:31.754
Where'd he go?

56:31.756 --> 56:33.055
Well, he took
Makewi's bike.

56:33.057 --> 56:34.523
He looked very determined.

56:34.525 --> 56:35.525
Oh, shit.

56:37.428 --> 56:40.396
May the winds
guide you, Jo!

56:56.446 --> 56:58.246
Hey, what do
you want, man?

56:59.616 --> 57:00.616
What the...

57:05.789 --> 57:06.622
Are we done here?

57:06.624 --> 57:08.757
I'm just
getting started!

57:09.559 --> 57:11.760
Get off of him!
Dude came at me.

57:11.762 --> 57:12.795
Get off of him
right now, Johnny,

57:12.797 --> 57:15.063
or I swear to God, I will run
you over with my car.

57:15.065 --> 57:17.499
Learn to throw a punch
like a man, huh?

57:17.501 --> 57:18.600
What, a man like you?

57:18.602 --> 57:21.870
Yeah, have fun with
my sloppy seconds, bro.

57:21.872 --> 57:23.906
Get over it, Johnny!

57:23.908 --> 57:25.974
We were
in high school!

57:25.976 --> 57:26.875
Fuck this!

57:26.877 --> 57:29.044
Yeah, tell your wife
and kid I say hey!

57:29.046 --> 57:31.046
I'm not married!

57:31.048 --> 57:32.080
Hey, are you okay?

57:32.082 --> 57:33.081
Honestly,
just leave me alone.

57:33.083 --> 57:36.618
I embarrassed
myself enough.

57:36.620 --> 57:37.019
Pete.

57:37.021 --> 57:39.121
I shouldn't have come here.
Why?

57:39.123 --> 57:41.590
Because you obviously
have a lot of loose ends

57:41.592 --> 57:42.558
that you
need to tie up,

57:42.560 --> 57:44.660
and I just get in the way,
okay? I get it.

57:44.662 --> 57:45.761
That's not true.

57:45.763 --> 57:46.895
Yes, it is!

57:46.897 --> 57:48.697
I tried
to kick his ass.

57:48.699 --> 57:50.599
I... I can't
even fight.

57:50.601 --> 57:52.568
I don't need anybody
to fight for me, Pete.

57:52.570 --> 57:54.536
I... I brought you
because you're a good guy,

57:54.538 --> 57:56.104
because you're someone
I want to get to know.

57:56.106 --> 57:59.641
Yeah, and I feel like you forge
t
that I'm even here.

57:59.643 --> 58:02.177
Pete, we need to talk.

58:04.547 --> 58:07.583
I'm gonna tell you
something I've never

58:07.585 --> 58:08.617
told anyone before,

58:08.619 --> 58:13.155
why... why I really
left here.

58:13.157 --> 58:15.924
Jo, I really understand.

58:15.926 --> 58:20.062
Okay?
No. No, you don't.

58:22.165 --> 58:26.168
I... I never had
an abortion.

58:26.636 --> 58:29.671
Why the hell would you lie
about something like that?

58:29.673 --> 58:31.773
No. No. I mean, um,

58:31.775 --> 58:35.177
I... I had the baby.

58:36.246 --> 58:37.646
What?

58:37.648 --> 58:39.615
Yeah.

58:39.617 --> 58:43.819
I... I was young.

58:43.821 --> 58:45.187
You know, I was 16, and...

58:45.189 --> 58:48.023
And Johnny and I
had decided that it was

58:48.025 --> 58:49.258
the right thing to do.

58:49.260 --> 58:51.727
But the... the night before,

58:51.729 --> 58:52.628
I just... I had this...

58:52.630 --> 58:56.265
This feeling that
I just couldn't shake.

58:56.267 --> 59:01.770
I... It just wasn't
something I could do.

59:01.772 --> 59:02.938
Well, what happened?

59:02.940 --> 59:06.108
I moved away and
actually had the baby.

59:06.110 --> 59:10.012
Everyone just thought
I had an abortion and left.

59:10.014 --> 59:12.848
What happened
to the baby?

59:13.550 --> 59:16.985
I had a closed adoption,
and that was that.

59:16.987 --> 59:19.288
You know, but, uh,

59:19.290 --> 59:21.189
now I have to live
with the fact

59:21.191 --> 59:22.624
that I have
a kid out there,

59:22.626 --> 59:26.929
and I'll never know
what she's doing

59:26.931 --> 59:29.565
unless she
comes and finds me,

59:29.567 --> 59:30.666
so, you know,
it's easier

59:30.668 --> 59:34.903
just to let everyone else
believe what they want.

59:36.907 --> 59:38.974
When my mom died, I...

59:38.976 --> 59:41.710
I lost the only woman
in my life.

59:41.712 --> 59:44.179
You know, my brothers
did their best,

59:44.181 --> 59:46.148
and my dad did
what he could,

59:46.150 --> 59:51.286
but then he, uh...
He started to dwindle away.

59:53.990 --> 59:55.824
Max did try, though,

59:55.826 --> 59:59.261
but, you know,
he was a drug addict.

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.930
How could he...

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:06.368
I started, uh,
painting these pictures

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:07.202
of these women,

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:10.706
but no matter how hard
I tried, I just...

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:13.008
All the women
in the paintings

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:14.843
resembled my mom.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.981
And nobody knew
any of that until now,

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:20.782
so I don't really know...

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:23.352
Don't say anything else.

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:26.888
I just want to hug you.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:32.728
God, Don, come on!

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.864
Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!

01:00:35.866 --> 01:00:36.898
Ow! Get...

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.334
She's a minor, Barry!
She's a little kid!

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:41.069
You're such a fucking
hypocrite, man.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.270
One minute,
she's an adult.

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:43.739
One minute
she's a kid.

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:44.673
Make up your mind!
Fuck you!

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:46.875
Dad, leave him alone.
I wanted to have the drink!

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:48.377
What is going on?

01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:51.380
Bearbear gave Ashley
a bit of alcohol.

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:52.781
Yeah, it was a mojito.

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:53.849
Hmm.
Good for you.

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.150
Enjoying my summer.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:55.817
Get off!

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:59.154
Hey, fatty.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:00:59.888
Ow.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.223
"Dear Diary..."
Come on.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.057
Get off!

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:03.892
"Oh, I saw
Jamie Linder's pee-pee

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:07.062
"in the locker room, and it
was red and beautiful.

01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:09.865
I want to hold it
in my mouth."

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:10.732
Remember that, fatty?

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:12.000
Is someone
gonna break them up?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.369
Ah, they're making up
for lost time.

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:15.671
Let 'em get
a few more in.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.305
They're not
so much fighting

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:20.442
as kind of
aggressively hugging.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.113
Little bitch!

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:25.847
Yeah! What now?!

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:28.083
You forget I wasn't
just a cheerleader.

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:29.818
I was also on
the wrestling team.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.220
Let's call a fruit a fruit,
Barry.

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:33.889
Come on, you liked
getting whipped

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:34.956
in the shower
after the match.

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:37.292
You're such a fucking asshole.
Yep.

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:41.063
You want more, bitch?
Aah!

01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:43.732
Ooh!
Ooh!

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.769
All right, enough.

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:49.137
It was an accident!

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:50.005
The coconuts?

01:01:50.007 --> 01:01:52.274
Really, Barry? That's enough.
That's enough.

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:55.444
Get the fuck off me.

01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:57.913
It was an accident.

01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:00.782
Just like
a fucking faggot

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:02.984
to go for the nuts.

01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:05.487
Daddy, look out!

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:08.023
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:10.158
but if you use that word
in that tone again,

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.360
your daughter as my witness, I
will bend you over

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:15.263
and show you how I lost my
virginity. We clear?

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:17.132
That's enough!

01:02:17.134 --> 01:02:18.934
Daddy, are you okay?

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:20.802
Pack your bags.

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:21.737
What, now?

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:22.504
Now!
Okay.

01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:23.972
Don, don't.
Don! Don!

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:25.440
Look, wait. Wait.
Don't go.

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:26.174
Don't go!

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:27.175
I am sick
of this fucking family

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:29.111
or whatever the fuck
you want to call it.

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:30.178
All right,
I want you to stay.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.047
I don't give a shit
what you want.

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:33.215
Look, Don!
I'm your father.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:34.282
I need you to stay.

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:35.951
Oh, you're my father
all of a sudden?

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.385
You lost that privilege
a long time ago!

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:40.522
Come on, Don. We could
talk abo ut this.

01:02:40.524 --> 01:02:42.724
Damn it!

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.326
You okay?

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.228
Come on. We're going.
Don, wait. Wait, Don.

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:47.796
I didn't abandon you,
Don. I was lost!

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:49.931
Yes. You know what? You were
fucking lost, Dad!

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.399
You were lost my whole
fucking life!

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:53.201
And you know what?
Stay the fuck lost!

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:54.402
No, Don, Don, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:56.905
I was a man in love.
What was I going to do with...

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:59.975
Yes, you loved! You loved one
woman more than you loved

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:01.309
fucking anything else
in the world,

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:03.011
and you couldn't see
anything else!

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:05.180
Where were you
at all my fucking games?

01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:06.982
At my graduation
or my wedding?

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:08.116
Your granddaughter
walks in the room,

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:09.551
you didn't even know
who the fuck she was.

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:12.120
Your daughter has an abortion!
You weren't there!

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:13.088
Where were you?
I know, Don.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.357
Your son comes out of the close
t
where were you?

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.558
Magnus was
fucking self-destructing

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.194
in front of your very eyes,
where the fuck were you?

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:20.362
I was here
when Magnus was here.

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:22.964
Bullshit!
I'm here for you right now!

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.000
Tell me what you want!
Don't!

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:25.867
Tell me what you want!

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:27.402
Don't try
and be my dad now.

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:28.336
It is too broken, man.

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:30.272
We are too broken
to fix.

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.907
Stop!
No!

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:32.909
Woody. Woody.

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.227
Uh...

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:28.263
can I sit here?

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:31.099
I mean,
it's the gay section.

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:32.934
I don't want you
to catch anything.

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:35.003
Look, I didn't mean
that you're a faggot.

01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:36.304
I... I don't know
what I meant, all right?

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:39.574
You punched my balls into my
mouth. I was in pain.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:42.143
Not the first time
I heard that.

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:44.579
Come on, bro.
I... I don't know

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.248
how to do this.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.520
I'm gonna go
talk to Jo.

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:53.855
Okay.

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:08.336
Can I borrow her
for a second?

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:12.040
I'm just gonna
get some coffee.

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:17.012
Hi.

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:17.913
Hi.

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:21.116
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:22.050
What?

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:24.986
Do you know
what your name means?

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:26.288
What, Jo?

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:28.023
No, Johana.

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:28.490
Should I?

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:31.059
Well, you gotta
drop the "J."

01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:33.061
Ohana?

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:36.298
Ohana.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.566
Where I come from,

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:43.171
"ohana"
means family.

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:47.642
And I'm someone
who strongly believes

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:48.977
in kismet, you know?

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:51.513
I believe
that things happen

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:53.014
for a reason, you know?

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:57.686
And I don't think your mom
named you that by accident.

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:14.502
Listen, man,
I-I'm really sorry.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:18.306
I... I have been
a really bad older brother.

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:25.046
You know what I don't
get is, you know...

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:27.983
you're the only person
who's ever used

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:30.085
my sexuality against me.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.454
You know,
I don't even remember

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.122
the last time
I was called a faggot,

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:38.193
and you show up and boom,
right back where we started

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:41.162
Well, dude, look at me.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:44.499
When I was
in high school, I was...

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.501
I was the man, you know?

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:47.402
I was varsity everything.

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:51.172
I got good grades.
I was wildly popular.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.275
No, I... I should've
cleared a path.

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:57.078
I mean, you were
already fat and gay.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:57.679
Fat and gay, great.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:00.081
Well, look how shit
turned out, all right?

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:02.650
Here I was this cocky guy,
knocked my girl up,

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:05.487
and then, you know,
I had to be an adult

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:06.521
for the rest of my life.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:11.459
You, you got to go
to college, become a...

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:13.395
You know, a doctor.

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:17.599
I'm dealing
with an ugly divorce.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:20.668
I'm trying to teach my kid
to be nothing like me

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.237
or her whore mother.

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.072
What are you
talking about?

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:25.206
I thought you liked
being married. No.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:28.676
She's been fucking around
behind my back for years.

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:31.012
Don, I had no idea.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.381
Now, dude, I love my kid.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:34.716
She's everything to me.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:37.485
Literally, she's...
She's all I have left.

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:41.389
Ashley and I moved out
of the house last week.

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:45.093
And staying here
ain't exactly perfect,

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:47.328
but anywhere's better
than there.

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:52.233
Ah, man.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.335
I miss Mom.

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:59.107
I didn't realize how much
until I got here,

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:00.708
saw all you guys.

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:06.648
Me, too.

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:10.285
Burwood.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:11.753
You can see him now.

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:14.155
He's still
out of it, but he

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:15.356
can have visitors.

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:17.258
Immediate family only.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.426
Right.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.804
He's still stable,

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:32.540
just resting.

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.620
Where is everybody?

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:53.828
You okay?

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:56.898
I have this idea.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.899
That's a bad thing,
though, right?

01:08:58.902 --> 01:09:00.902
No, this is
a good thing,

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:03.104
but follow my lead.

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:07.709
Oh, God.

01:09:07.711 --> 01:09:09.243
Why?

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:31.799
Guys.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.408
Look at you,

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:43.377
the three of you
together again.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.613
You good?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:47.881
Never better.

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:52.453
Magnus and Mom
say hello.

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:57.192
You know,
when I was away...

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.963
my favorite passage
from Magnus' book

01:10:01.965 --> 01:10:03.298
came to me.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.766
I memorized it.

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:07.468
I want you to hear it.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:13.841
"A wolf is always strongest
when he's with his pack.

01:10:13.843 --> 01:10:19.314
"Every day,
a dire wolf dies,

01:10:19.316 --> 01:10:22.550
but the pack
must stay together."

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:28.456
"And when they do,

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:31.292
"in the end,

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:33.761
they will prevail."

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:37.765
"The tighter the pack,
the stronger the wolf."

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:42.537
"I want you guys
to remember us

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:45.373
"when we were
at our best,

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:48.943
when your mom was there."

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:53.948
"Then we can all
dine in Valhalla

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:55.783
together." Huh?

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.553
We can be a pack, Dad.

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:01.956
If we weren't in a hospital,
I' d howl right now.

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:06.494
Hi.

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:09.897
I-I'm sorry. I have to
check his vitals.

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:10.732
Yeah.

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:13.735
You guys go on.

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:16.471
I'm not going anywhere.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:35.490
How's he doing?

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:36.591
Uh, he's okay,
I guess.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:37.458
Good,
good, good.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.393
We should...
We should go.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:40.428
Why are you dressed
like Doogie Howser?

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:41.362
I will
explain that later.

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:43.398
We should get back
to the house right now.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:43.998
Where's Kiwi?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.702
He said that he would be waitin
g
in the car for you.

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:57.945
Uh, okay.

01:11:57.947 --> 01:11:59.614
What the hell
is that?

01:11:59.616 --> 01:12:01.015
Is that a corpse?

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.383
This is
your bruddah.

01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:03.484
That's Magnus?
Yeah.

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:05.687
Makewi, you know why this
is bad, right?

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:06.821
You know why...

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:07.922
Where the hell
did you find him?

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:09.757
What the fuck is the matter
with this guy?

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.459
Okay, there's only one
hospital in town, yeah?

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:13.795
So, two plus two. We checked
the autopsy room.

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:14.996
There he was.

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:16.364
You guys, I am so sorry.

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:17.632
I had no idea
that he was gonna...

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:20.435
Never mind. What the fuck are
we gonna do with him?

01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:23.371
We're going
to give him a proper

01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:23.805
Viking funeral.

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:26.874
Oh. Oh, you're going to give
him a proper Viking funeral?

01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:28.443
What the fuck is that?

01:12:28.445 --> 01:12:31.012
We're going to put him in a boa
t
set him afloat,

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.381
and I'm gonna shoot
flaming arrows at him

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:33.981
and set him on fire.

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:35.850
No, no, no, no, no.
That is not happening.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:39.020
Okay, you are taking him back
to the morgue immediately.

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:40.388
And how are you
gonna do that, Barry?

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:43.458
You're gonna just waltz into th
e
morgue with a fucking corpse?

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.625
I don't know!

01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:46.094
Take him back
the way you got him!

01:12:46.096 --> 01:12:48.029
Guys, would you
please just listen.

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:51.766
I am just reading
the signs here, okay?

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:52.400
Honey...

01:12:52.402 --> 01:12:55.403
I took up archery in my 30s.
What for? Huh?

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.673
I start building
the ark. Why?

01:12:58.675 --> 01:13:02.744
It's because I'm
reading the signs.

01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:05.813
And guess
who's writing 'em?

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:06.948
Magnus.

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:08.516
He's telling me
to do so.

01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:09.817
Gimme the mushrooms,
okay?

01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:11.786
I'm not
eating mushrooms.

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:14.088
Barry, I'm all... I'm all
for your open-mindedness

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:15.123
in this relationship,

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:16.891
but are you
fucking serious?

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:18.493
Not now, okay?
I'm try...

01:13:18.495 --> 01:13:20.561
Yeah, you know,
we have to do this.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:21.896
Do... What?
Are you serious?

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.898
It just makes sense.
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.800
It makes perfect sense.
Totally.

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:26.934
Let's
blow up brother.

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.102
Let's do that.
Let's fucking...

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:29.904
Didn't you just hear
what Dad told us?

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.572
I mean,
let's start right now

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:32.540
working together
as a pack.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:35.977
What would Magnus want
if it was one of us, huh?

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:40.114
He would want one of us to shoo
t
flaming arrows at him.

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:43.985
We need a body of water.

01:13:43.987 --> 01:13:44.719
Jo...
Yes.

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:45.953
Is it... What are you
laughing at?

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:47.622
This is not funny.
Yes, right.

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:49.590
No, no, no.
This is hilarious,

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:50.825
and actually I have
a great idea.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:53.127
Remember that lake
behind Arthur Park?

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:54.796
Yes!
Yeah, I used to go there.

01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:56.097
I'd blow
all sorts of shit up.

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:58.533
With M-80's, I'd fucking
blow up furniture.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:13:59.634
I'd light
my textbooks on fire.

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:00.768
I'm not gonna
get arrested, okay?

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.203
I'm not gonna do that.
I never got arrested.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:04.005
Yeah. Well, you didn't have a
dead body with you either.

01:14:04.007 --> 01:14:07.008
You know what? You have to take
some fucking responsibility

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:09.677
for what you bring... for your
role in this family.

01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:11.779
Okay. I don't
think we should

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:12.781
be fighting like this.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.115
You are a fucking idiot
sometimes, man.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.583
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:17.465
And you are
a fucking lunatic.

01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:19.086
This is important.

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.455
Will you guys
listen to me?

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:22.657
Who brought
this fucking guy?

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:25.893
You are fucking guy.
I'm not fucking guy.

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:27.528
Listen, shut up!

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.497
I am reading
the signs.

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:30.832
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

01:14:30.834 --> 01:14:33.701
Shut the fuck up!

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:39.507
Look, I read Magnus' book,
me, not you, me!

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:41.108
And if
I learned anything,

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.478
it's that a Viking goes to war
with any size army

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.980
as long as he's fighting
for his family.

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:50.084
Who gives a shit
about our fucking past?

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:52.887
It sucked.
Okay, big deal.

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:55.957
But let's take this moment
to prove to ourselves

01:14:55.959 --> 01:15:00.561
that all of us have at least
one selfless bone in our body.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:02.663
We just watched
our father have a stroke.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.599
Our brother is dead,
and what're we doing?

01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:07.168
We're blaming each other for
shit that happened in the past,

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:10.004
that doesn't even
fucking matter anymore.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:13.040
I really think
that this is what Magnus

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:14.575
would've wanted.

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:17.078
Right?

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.713
Anybody?

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:23.251
Yeah, fuck it.
I'm in.

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.286
Bear?

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:29.957
I mean, if you really think
this is what he wants.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:30.959
Okay.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:38.966
When Mom was alive,
she was always our rock.

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:41.702
Magnus tried
everything he could

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.571
to fulfill that legacy.

01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:45.873
Now it's our turn.

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:44.365
You almost ready to go?

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:49.070
Yeah. I'm just finishing
this last little...

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:52.406
Okay, let's go.

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:54.175
I really like this one.

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:55.376
Mm, it's okay.

01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:57.912
I'll finish it later.

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:04.051
When my mother died,
my family fell apart.

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:06.354
My brother tried
to put us back together.

01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:08.656
When he died,
he achieved his goal.

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:10.891
We've become a family again.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:15.029
Sometimes in death,
breath is drawn into a new life

01:17:15.031 --> 01:17:17.999
Today is the day
of my namesake's reckoning.

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:20.267
One day, we'll dine
in Valhalla with Odin,

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:23.304
and we will once again
be together as a family.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:27.675
Sincerely, your daughter,
sister, and friend,

01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:29.343
Johana Burwood.
