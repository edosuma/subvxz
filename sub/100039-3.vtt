She fell about 30 feet.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.169
She fractured her skull.

08:33.169 --> 08:35.169
We've done everything we could,

08:35.169 --> 08:37.999
but I'm afraid there are
no signs of brain activity.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.879
I-I...

08:40.880 --> 08:42.578
I don't understand.
I...

08:42.580 --> 08:45.419
Is she...

08:45.420 --> 08:47.119
Is she brain-dead?

08:47.120 --> 08:50.579
We, um... need to wait
several more hours

08:50.580 --> 08:53.919
and then run one more exam
to make the final determination,

08:53.920 --> 08:56.079
but it seems likely.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.039
I'm sorry.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.750
♪♪

09:13.080 --> 09:16.079
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Everly to the ER.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.289
Dr. Everly to the ER.
Hey, I was just
trying to call.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.210
Have you told anyone?

09:18.211 --> 09:19.709
Just Jo.

09:19.710 --> 09:21.879
Which was apparently very wrong
and I'm sorry.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.919
Did something happen?

09:23.920 --> 09:25.919
N-No. Just, uh...
Just... We're not there yet,

09:25.920 --> 09:28.249
at the...
telling-people part.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.290
Jo's my best friend.
And you told Maggie, so...

09:31.330 --> 09:32.919
I'll just stick
with "I'm sorry."

09:32.920 --> 09:34.499
Can I ask how you're feeling?

09:34.500 --> 09:37.500
Mm.
Sleepy... and pukey.

09:38.920 --> 09:39.960
My two favorite dwarves.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.080
Bird.

09:45.580 --> 09:46.959
Bird.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.079
Ma'am, are you okay?

09:49.080 --> 09:50.329
Bird.

09:50.330 --> 09:51.750
Bird?

09:52.750 --> 09:54.959
Ma'am, are you dizzy?

09:54.960 --> 09:59.079
Oh.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.669
Okay. Uh, ma'am, ma'am,
my name is Dr. Lincoln,

10:01.670 --> 10:03.499
and we'd like to try to get you
some help, okay?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.330
Bird.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.170
Bird!

10:09.620 --> 10:11.289
Absolutely not.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.959
But she won't let anyone touch
her, including you.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.669
Which is very sad,
and in my opinion, very foolish,

10:16.670 --> 10:19.209
but I am not granting
Meredith Grey privileges.

10:19.210 --> 10:20.959
So, would you say
because Dr. Grey's gone,

10:20.960 --> 10:23.459
we're giving worse care?

10:23.460 --> 10:25.789
Uh, Qadri, keep your rhetorical
questions to yourself.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.039
It is one surgery.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.829
One surgery too many,
Dr. Karev.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.789
Look...
I already made a concession

10:31.790 --> 10:33.959
by agreeing to let you perform
a complicated surgery

10:33.960 --> 10:35.499
that you have only observed.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.329
I made this concession because
I have faith in you.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.459
If your patient
doesn't share that faith,

10:40.460 --> 10:42.459
uh, I would direct my energy
into convincing her.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.169
But Meredith Grey
is not stepping foot

10:44.170 --> 10:45.170
into one of my ORs.

10:47.710 --> 10:50.750
What if she doesn't have to
set foot in the OR to help?

10:52.170 --> 10:53.920
I'm listening.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.829
Maggie: Contrast.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.579
Are you feeling any discomfort,
Mr...

10:58.580 --> 11:01.379
um... Bertie?

11:01.380 --> 11:05.209
I haven't felt this good since
my wife and I went to Woodstock.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.539
You know what I mean?

11:06.540 --> 11:07.709
You went to Woodstock?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.419
We were a little
on the older side,

11:09.420 --> 11:11.669
but Lois liked
to keep up with the kids.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.329
We left when it started to rain.

11:14.330 --> 11:16.419
I don't have too many regrets
in my life,

11:16.420 --> 11:18.709
but I sure regret leaving
that party early.

11:18.710 --> 11:20.209
What else?

11:20.210 --> 11:23.040
Not writing enough love letters
to Lois.

11:24.830 --> 11:27.540
Not quitting my job earlier.

11:30.380 --> 11:34.750
Drinking too much when my...
My kid got sick.

11:38.210 --> 11:40.709
And the train station...

11:40.710 --> 11:43.710
It was...
It was supposed to be 3:00.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.039
It was so... It was so hot.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.120
It was...

11:52.880 --> 11:54.619
What was I saying?

11:54.620 --> 11:57.379
Um, you were... you were
talking about your regrets.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.959
- Heparin.
- Oh, right.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.880
Can't change the past, can you?

12:05.540 --> 12:08.579
But I'll tell you,
I think I got the secret.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.579
It's love.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.919
Love makes it all worthwhile.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.619
All of it, Bertie?

12:14.620 --> 12:18.119
Really?
The heartbreak, the loss,

12:18.120 --> 12:19.999
the back-stabbing,
the petty behavior of people

12:20.000 --> 12:21.749
that you thought
you could trust?

12:21.750 --> 12:23.120
Love makes all of that
worthwhile?

12:25.330 --> 12:27.919
Uh, I'm Dr. Karev.
I'm the chief.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.459
I-I don't know if Heather ever
discussed her wishes with you,

12:30.460 --> 12:34.669
but if not, um,
then you can decide if you...

12:34.670 --> 12:37.080
If we want to unplug our sister.

12:38.670 --> 12:42.419
Um... I don't know
what Heather would want,

12:42.420 --> 12:44.419
but I can't imagine it's th...

12:44.420 --> 12:45.999
No. No. No.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.789
This is not how we end, okay?

12:47.790 --> 12:50.829
We are family, and I know that
we have drifted apart,

12:50.830 --> 12:52.789
but this can't be how we end.

12:52.790 --> 12:57.039
What, she just... she walks
into a dig-site and dies?

12:57.040 --> 12:58.959
Come on.
I don't accept that.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.829
I'm sorry.
This is not how we end.

13:00.830 --> 13:01.959
Where are you going?

13:01.960 --> 13:03.379
I don't know!

13:03.380 --> 13:04.380
Okay.

13:06.710 --> 13:09.119
Yeah, she's pretty badly
dehydrated.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.329
Should we get her a banana bag?

13:10.330 --> 13:11.539
I don't want to poke her until

13:11.540 --> 13:12.829
I can explain what I'm doing.

13:12.830 --> 13:14.209
Interpreter's been paged.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.379
Bird.

13:15.380 --> 13:16.960
Bird!

13:24.460 --> 13:26.620
Oh.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.829
She's Korean. She says
she's lost... something.

13:33.830 --> 13:35.670
Ask if she knows her name.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.209
Oh Soyoung.

13:41.210 --> 13:42.999
She knows her name.
Her name's Soyoung.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.580
Ask her if she knows
what year it is.

13:47.330 --> 13:48.829
Hey, what's going on?

13:48.830 --> 13:50.209
We're not sure.

13:50.210 --> 13:52.999
We found her lost in a hallway,
leaning against a wall.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.580
She's dizzy and very dehydrated.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.829
She said she has a friend that's
a bird and she lost him.

13:59.830 --> 14:02.249
I don't know.
She seems a little disoriented.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.879
Alright, let's get her hydrated,

14:03.880 --> 14:05.919
and we'll give her a work-up
just in case.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.999
And see if you can get her
to call her family.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Okay.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.999
Koracick:
Entering the ER!

14:13.000 --> 14:15.539
Wh... Whoa, whoa.

14:15.540 --> 14:17.620
Just trying
to make this easy, Hunt.

14:18.620 --> 14:19.790
Here you go.

14:21.540 --> 14:23.880
Alright.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.580
If Dr. Grey's not with you,
don't even bother.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.709
Dr. Grey!

14:34.710 --> 14:36.379
How was Machu Picchu?

14:36.380 --> 14:38.539
Ugh. I thought if my liver
didn't kill me,

14:38.540 --> 14:39.959
that bus ride was gonna.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.249
Ms. Gregory,

14:41.250 --> 14:42.749
I have permission from the chief

14:42.750 --> 14:44.249
to allow Dr. Grey
to observe

14:44.250 --> 14:46.539
and assist remotely
on your surgery.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.459
Meaning that they'll have me
on video-chat

14:48.460 --> 14:51.209
so I can see every move
that Dr. Karev is making.

14:51.210 --> 14:53.249
Fortunately,
my supervisor owes me.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.879
So, just your face?
Not your hands?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.919
Remote surgery is practiced
all over the world.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.999
I'd rather do it myself,
but a judge has decided

15:01.000 --> 15:03.499
that I better stay on this side
of the road instead.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.169
So, it's the next best thing.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.619
That judge sounds like
a horse's ass.

15:06.620 --> 15:08.750
I won't fight you on that.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.249
She was a good student?

15:12.250 --> 15:14.749
Shirley, she was a great
student, excellent.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.079
You're in very good hands.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.749
♪♪

15:19.750 --> 15:21.079
Alright, then.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.669
But don't kill me.

15:22.670 --> 15:24.119
Okay. Okay.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.249
We will text you
when we are ready.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.250
Woman: Get back to work!

15:32.920 --> 15:34.289
Okay, okay.

15:34.290 --> 15:35.919
Whoa, whoa. Hang on.
Stop squirming.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.459
Hey.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.289
Hi... Hi. What...
What are you doing here?

15:39.290 --> 15:41.169
Um, Koracick.
What are you doing here?

15:41.170 --> 15:43.619
Oh, you know,
just... failing.

15:43.620 --> 15:46.619
I mean, really, deeply failing

15:46.620 --> 15:49.379
in a poo-covered,
publicly humiliating way.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.169
Let me. Let me.

15:51.170 --> 15:52.789
Okay. Thanks.
Just go under.

15:52.790 --> 15:53.790
- Yeah. I got her. Hey.
- Okay.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.289
It j-just...
Just went up her back.

15:55.290 --> 15:56.459
I mean, it's... it's everywhere.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.329
Yeah. Well, it's bad.
It's a bad one. Yeah.

15:58.330 --> 15:59.619
Okay. There we go.

15:59.620 --> 16:00.999
You're good.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.039
And, boom.
And there you go.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.669
It's... I think we got it.

16:04.670 --> 16:08.539
And here... we... are.
Aah.

16:08.540 --> 16:10.329
- Wow. Thanks.
- Yeah.

16:10.330 --> 16:12.039
- I got it.
- Oh, thanks.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.999
Mm. Mm.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.379
Okay, so, I, uh...
I guess we'll just, um...

16:17.380 --> 16:19.209
I guess we'll just go
to the park.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.039
Hey, why don't...

16:21.040 --> 16:23.209
why don't we give her a tour
of the hospital, hmm?

16:23.210 --> 16:24.499
I got a couple scans to look at,

16:24.500 --> 16:26.499
and I'm not ready to say goodbye
to you both yet.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.419
You're just humoring me

16:28.420 --> 16:30.329
because you know I miss
the smell of blood.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.669
And that's why you love me.

16:31.670 --> 16:32.999
I do.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.879
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Bowie to Pediatrics.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.669
Dr. Bowie to Pediatrics.

16:36.670 --> 16:38.539
Hey.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.039
Hi.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.999
How you feeling?
Any soreness?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.580
Eh, that's a personal question.

16:44.580 --> 16:45.829
What... What happened here?

16:45.830 --> 16:47.829
Oh, run over with a 4x4
on a walk-through.

16:47.830 --> 16:49.379
Ah. Let me see.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.499
- Mm.
- Okay.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.669
Yeah, I can...
I can make that disappear.

16:53.670 --> 16:54.749
Oh, really?

16:54.750 --> 16:56.329
- Yeah, of course.
- Wow.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.079
I can throw
a couple sutures in there.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.709
It'll heal up much better.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.499
I mean, unless you like scars.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.789
Well, scars are cool.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.079
Facial scars, though?

17:04.079 --> 17:05.419
Yeah, those are
the coolest kind.

17:05.420 --> 17:06.700
You don't want to see my skills?

17:08.710 --> 17:10.749
Come on.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.079
It's not lying
not to tell people, right?

17:13.079 --> 17:15.618
It's your first trimester.
Mm.

17:15.619 --> 17:17.378
I'm just so used to
rigorous honesty...

17:17.380 --> 17:18.959
I feel like I'm lying to
everyone I talk to.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.419
Honesty and privacy
are not mutually exclusive.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.709
Ooh.
I like that.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.459
Pretend you have
the nuclear codes,

17:25.460 --> 17:27.209
and if you tell anyone
you're pregnant,

17:27.210 --> 17:28.459
then the whole world will end.

17:28.460 --> 17:30.539
That feels entirely possible.

17:30.540 --> 17:32.209
So, Ms. Oh doesn't
want a work-up.

17:32.210 --> 17:34.379
She keeps insisting that
nothing's wrong,

17:34.380 --> 17:36.709
but her passport's
from South Korea.

17:36.710 --> 17:38.539
I'm nervous she has dementia,

17:38.540 --> 17:41.079
and she somehow got herself
on a plane to the U.S.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.829
Okay. We should just admit her
for her own safety,

17:43.830 --> 17:46.000
at least until we can locate
some family.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.789
Hi, Bertie.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.329
How you feeling?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.459
Restless.

17:52.460 --> 17:55.419
I hate hospital rooms.
Can I take a walk yet?

17:55.420 --> 17:58.169
The sedation has just worn off.
I think it's best if you...

17:58.170 --> 18:01.080
How about...
we walk together?

18:04.330 --> 18:05.420
Deal.

18:09.420 --> 18:12.749
And thank you
for always sticking up for me

18:12.750 --> 18:14.749
when we were little......

18:14.750 --> 18:16.750
Teaching me it's okay
to say no...

18:18.750 --> 18:22.329

to wrap around my waist

18:22.330 --> 18:24.619

18:24.620 --> 18:26.499
I'm sorry we fell apart.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.039
If there was anything
I could do...

18:29.040 --> 18:30.960
'Scuse me.

18:32.330 --> 18:34.379
What... What are you...
What are you doing?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.379
This whole building
is bad vibes.

18:36.380 --> 18:39.119
I can feel them pulsating
off the walls, you know?

18:39.120 --> 18:40.669
And that's not
gonna help her heal.

18:40.670 --> 18:43.459
She needs good energy.

18:43.460 --> 18:44.829
There's nothing to heal.

Well, he said that nothing's
official for a few hours.

18:47.170 --> 18:50.959
So... she's got time.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.169
That's just a technicality,
Haylee.

18:53.170 --> 18:54.459
She's not gonna get better.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.209
I know it's difficult,
but can we...

18:56.210 --> 18:59.329
Okay, so, do you want me to just
pull the plug out of the wall?

18:59.330 --> 19:01.329
Look, just because
she can't talk to us

19:01.330 --> 19:03.289
doesn't mean that
she's not in there.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.539
That is exactly what it means.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.379
Really? Oh, okay.

19:06.380 --> 19:07.879
Well, why were you
just talking to her?

19:07.880 --> 19:11.209
Because... I'm grieving
and I'm irrational.

19:11.210 --> 19:13.329
You're giving up,
just like you did with Mom.

19:13.330 --> 19:15.169
Maybe if you got
some fresh air...

19:15.170 --> 19:16.829
Don't you dare talk
to me about Mom.

19:16.830 --> 19:19.249
I visited her every day
while you were off

19:19.250 --> 19:21.749
Eat-Pray-Loving yourself

19:21.750 --> 19:22.999
I paid for her Reiki!

19:23.000 --> 19:24.749
Reiki? Reiki doesn't
cure cancer!

19:24.750 --> 19:26.249

19:26.250 --> 19:27.919
You always resented me
for that trip!

19:27.920 --> 19:30.579

when their parents are dying!

19:30.580 --> 19:32.669

my therapist...

19:32.670 --> 19:34.169
you'd quit crying
over spilled milk!
I think we're
a little ways off from that.

It's under control now.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.619
Factory accident,

21:40.620 --> 21:43.499
We put a filter in
with endovascular access

21:43.500 --> 21:45.379
to prevent distal embolization,

21:45.380 --> 21:47.789
