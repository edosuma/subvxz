00:04.089 --> 00:10.178
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus!
I'm really, really close.

00:10.261 --> 00:13.056
Oh, God! Oh, that's so hot.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.809
Could you just
stick your finger in my...

00:16.851 --> 00:17.894
Like this?

00:18.228 --> 00:20.563
Yes. Oh, yeah.

00:21.731 --> 00:25.652
Don't stop.
Don't stop.

00:28.279 --> 00:29.572
I...

00:32.075 --> 00:35.286
Did you hear that noise?
Outside.

00:36.788 --> 00:38.790
You're so jumpy.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.086
I told you, my husband's
not gonna be back till Sunday.

00:49.968 --> 00:51.428
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:01.980 --> 01:03.398
Oh, my God!

01:07.527 --> 01:09.571
Jesus! Oh, my...

01:12.031 --> 01:16.244
Oh, my God!

01:39.768 --> 01:41.853
You know I never really do this.

01:44.189 --> 01:46.107
Me neither.

01:46.191 --> 01:47.233
Come on.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.612
For real.

01:51.738 --> 01:53.031
You're the only one.

01:54.741 --> 01:56.242
Like, ever?

02:01.039 --> 02:02.749
That's crazy.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.168
You could've had any girl you wanted.

02:06.753 --> 02:08.213
I wanted you.

02:10.381 --> 02:11.883
I wanted you, too.

02:12.425 --> 02:14.302
Since the first moment
I saw you in the market,

02:14.385 --> 02:16.179
hanging out with your friends,

02:18.723 --> 02:20.183
I knew you were special.

02:37.742 --> 02:39.911
What kind of trees are those?

02:40.870 --> 02:42.080
Olive.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.252
It's like I never saw them before.

02:54.551 --> 02:55.593
I've got to go.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.638
You won't stay for supper?

03:00.265 --> 03:01.683
I already ate.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.311
Oh. Okay.

03:06.271 --> 03:10.400
Oh, no. It's... It's not like that.

03:11.693 --> 03:15.113
I just have to do something

03:16.531 --> 03:17.782
for my dad.

03:18.825 --> 03:20.326
In the middle of the night?

03:21.619 --> 03:23.121
I made him a promise.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.968
Tonight meant a lot to me.

03:37.969 --> 03:40.346
And no matter what happens,

03:40.430 --> 03:42.390
I want you to remember one thing.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.269
I love you.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.855
What? You...

03:48.938 --> 03:55.445
And also, you can never,
ever tell anyone about this.

03:58.531 --> 03:59.574
Cool?

04:01.451 --> 04:02.619
Cool.

04:16.549 --> 04:17.967
Cool.

04:20.553 --> 04:23.097
Jesus?
Jesus, are you in there?

04:23.181 --> 04:24.557
Stay right there.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.566
What's up, guys?

04:33.650 --> 04:34.817
Where the hell have you been?

04:34.901 --> 04:36.569
We've been worried sick.

04:36.653 --> 04:38.488
You said you were going
to the garden to pray.

04:39.155 --> 04:42.283
Yeah, I was in the garden.

04:42.367 --> 04:46.913
You guys were passed out,
so I came here

04:46.996 --> 04:48.873
to bless this ailing woman.

04:56.547 --> 04:59.592
The chief priests are
on the warpath. We've got to move.

04:59.676 --> 05:01.719
- Chill, bro.
- No, I will not chill.

05:01.803 --> 05:02.845
They want to kill you, man.

05:02.929 --> 05:07.475
Blessed are they who are persecuted
for the sake of righteousness,

05:07.558 --> 05:09.769
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.896
The hell does that even mean, man?

05:11.980 --> 05:14.649
You'll understand. Someday.

05:14.732 --> 05:15.984
Come on.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.236
Judas is meeting us at midnight
with the getaway donkeys.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.450
It's been real.

05:38.798 --> 05:43.261
Don't worry, my dear.
Your secret is safe with me.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.808
Yes.

06:30.892 --> 06:36.314
I am the man who ordered the hit
on your little band of ne'er-do-wells.

06:36.397 --> 06:40.568
But circumstances intervened,
and I changed my mind.

06:42.028 --> 06:43.613
I'm not here to kill you.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.324
You have questions.

06:47.075 --> 06:50.036
I have answers.

06:56.542 --> 07:03.007
These portfolios contain
classified information

07:03.966 --> 07:08.012
on the worldwide conglomerate
known as the Grail.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.140
Yes, we hold monopolies
in 113 countries,

07:11.224 --> 07:16.270
but we also have a hand
in agencies of a more divine authority.

07:16.354 --> 07:18.147
Are you blind, boy?

07:19.607 --> 07:20.650
Uh, no.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.527
Would you like to be?

07:28.866 --> 07:31.119
Where were we?

07:31.202 --> 07:32.662
You were implying

07:32.745 --> 07:35.248
that your organization works with Heaven.

07:35.331 --> 07:37.667
Hand in glove for two millennia.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.002
Then you can tell me, where is God?

07:40.086 --> 07:42.964
Good question.
"No idea," is the short answer.

07:44.215 --> 07:47.718
That's the long answer as well.

07:47.802 --> 07:50.888
What I do know is you won't find Him alone.

07:51.848 --> 07:54.559
I have resources. I can help.

07:55.059 --> 08:00.231
So, if you'll take a look here
at some of our holdings...

08:04.569 --> 08:07.196
I said... Where's God?

08:08.364 --> 08:10.408
I don't know.

08:13.744 --> 08:18.457
Your power is inspiring.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.334
Then tell me why I shouldn't inspire it

08:20.418 --> 08:22.253
to ram this down your throat?

08:22.795 --> 08:27.091
Because, Preacher Custer, you need me.

08:30.094 --> 08:31.929
Pie charts, spreadsheets.

08:32.013 --> 08:33.973
What do you have that I need?

08:36.934 --> 08:41.814
Did you know that God
was last seen here

08:41.898 --> 08:43.608
in New Orleans?

08:46.444 --> 08:48.362
Yes, I had that feeling.

08:48.446 --> 08:50.323
We knew for a fact.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.992
We were alerted
the moment He went missing.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.786
Came straightaway.
Implemented a cover-up.

08:57.914 --> 08:59.165
The tape.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.502
You hired Mark Harelik.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.548
You were the ones that killed him.

09:07.632 --> 09:11.093
I'm offering you access to our power.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.305
Information. Reach.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.099
Tell me you're not intrigued.

09:22.980 --> 09:23.981
On second thought,

09:24.065 --> 09:28.903
you're not really a three-ring-binder
kind of man. Are you?

09:37.662 --> 09:40.665
Yes. Durando?

09:41.374 --> 09:44.502
Let them know we're coming in.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.840
Let's go.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.266
I'm not wearing that.

09:58.349 --> 10:00.643
Then I'm afraid the journey ends here.

10:03.688 --> 10:06.857
You see, we don't trust you, either.

10:56.866 --> 10:59.577
Damn it. Damn it! God damn it!

11:16.093 --> 11:19.555
Hey! You're awake.
You feeling any better?

11:20.139 --> 11:21.599
Yeah. What's going on?

11:22.641 --> 11:24.226
Oh, yeah, right. That's April.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.437
It's an early birthday gift for the boy. I have...

11:26.812 --> 11:29.565
I've missed, like, the last 83 or something.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.442
So I just... I splurged.
You know what I mean?

11:31.901 --> 11:33.444
Um, have you seen Jesse?

11:33.527 --> 11:35.654
He's not banging on me door
complaining about the noise,

11:35.738 --> 11:37.198
so he's out, I guess.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.824
Do you want us to turn the music down?

11:38.908 --> 11:40.284
No, no. That's not what I...

11:40.368 --> 11:43.037
Check this out.
Got it down at Circuit Works this morning.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.914
Denis, turn the music down.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.046
Honestly, that kid,
he's gonna put me in an early grave.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.631
Or a late one.

11:54.507 --> 11:57.218
Um, did he say where he was going or...

11:57.301 --> 12:01.764
No. No. Why? What's up?
Are you all right?

12:04.558 --> 12:05.851
Excuse me.

12:05.935 --> 12:07.228
Hello.

12:08.813 --> 12:10.856
I didn't want Denis to feel self-conscious.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.652
Do you wanna hang?
We're about to play Twister.

12:15.653 --> 12:16.779
No.

12:16.862 --> 12:20.491
Um, you know what?
I'm gonna make us breakfast.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.368
Great. All right.

12:23.077 --> 12:25.413
We'll twist up an appetite.

12:25.496 --> 12:26.872
- Okay.
- All right, then.

12:36.132 --> 12:37.341
Yeah.

12:38.801 --> 12:39.969
Make breakfast.

13:04.285 --> 13:05.786
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:05.870 --> 13:08.372
So, breakfast for lunch?

13:08.456 --> 13:11.208
Oh, yeah. Was cooking.

13:13.127 --> 13:18.174
So, yeah, hey, um...
I was just wondering about my gun.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.927
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was gonna bring it over later.

13:22.011 --> 13:24.680
It's all right.
Do you still need it?

13:24.763 --> 13:26.557
No, no. I'll go get it.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.238
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry.</i>

13:41.655 --> 13:42.740
<i>Thanks.</i>

13:43.032 --> 13:44.200
<i>Also,</i>

13:46.452 --> 13:48.037
it sort of went off.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.332
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.085
Anyway, but I can pay you for the bullet.

13:55.419 --> 13:56.754
No. You know what? It's okay.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.589
- You sure?
- Yeah.

14:00.132 --> 14:01.258
Oh.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.428
Okay.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.434
As long as you're okay.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.020
Are you okay?

14:14.939 --> 14:15.981
I'm okay.

14:20.861 --> 14:21.904
Are you sure?

14:22.947 --> 14:24.698
I'm sure. I'm okay.

14:27.952 --> 14:29.203
Think you lost an egg.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.579
What?

14:35.626 --> 14:36.877
No, 'cause I...

14:38.671 --> 14:39.797
I did...

14:51.976 --> 14:53.310
No, don't do that. You don't...

14:54.436 --> 14:55.479
I...

15:18.711 --> 15:19.753
Thank you.

15:38.314 --> 15:39.773
Check your pockets, please.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.249
Piercings?

15:57.708 --> 15:58.709
No.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.571
Sir.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.245
Are you ready?

16:39.291 --> 16:42.378
Good afternoon.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.547
Jesse, meet His Holiness,
the Pope, Bishop of Rome,

16:45.631 --> 16:48.926
and the Right Honorable
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.595
Gentlemen, Jesse Custer.

16:55.724 --> 16:56.975
Nice to meet you.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.691
So it was, like, Annville,
and then we're looking for God.

17:03.774 --> 17:08.195
And then Viktor
and then all the stuff with the Saint.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.823
I'm confused.
How did you get rid of him?

17:12.741 --> 17:15.577
Well, we got him a soul,

17:16.328 --> 17:18.872
and then, uh, Jesse
sent him to Hell with his mind power.

17:20.332 --> 17:21.458
Oh.

17:22.793 --> 17:27.339
Well, I mean, that's good, right?
He handled it.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.134
Yeah, it is good.

17:30.634 --> 17:31.635
But?

17:36.598 --> 17:38.058
I just got this feeling.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.437
That something's not right.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.648
- Yeah.
- Well, I mean...

17:44.732 --> 17:46.817
If Jesse said that he handled it...

17:49.570 --> 17:51.530
Did you see him send the Saint to Hell?

17:51.613 --> 17:53.532
- No, but...
- But he said that he did?

17:53.615 --> 17:54.950
That's what he told you?

17:55.701 --> 17:57.494
- Yeah.
- Hmm...

17:57.619 --> 17:59.329
Wonder what could be not right about that?

18:03.709 --> 18:08.422
- Who knows? I mean, it's just a feeling.
- You know?

18:10.841 --> 18:12.176
Maybe I'm going crazy.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.012
No.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.848
Mmm-mmm.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.852
- I told you about my ex, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.021
Rodney had a drinking problem,

18:24.897 --> 18:27.149
and I told him he had to quit,

18:27.232 --> 18:29.318
and he swore to me that he did.

18:29.401 --> 18:33.739
But I just... I had this feeling,

18:35.365 --> 18:39.536
you know, this suspicion that he was lying,
and it wouldn't go away.

18:40.496 --> 18:42.206
I thought I was nuts.

18:42.956 --> 18:46.460
Then, one day, I found
a fifth of vodka in his jacket pocket.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.296
Even though I loved him,

18:49.379 --> 18:51.465
I had to finally wise up and leave him.

18:53.133 --> 18:58.680
I'm just saying, usually,
if something feels wrong, it is wrong.

19:01.517 --> 19:03.435
And you are not crazy.

19:05.896 --> 19:06.980
Hmm...

19:07.397 --> 19:09.566
What are you doing? No!

19:10.400 --> 19:11.777
Get away from me!

19:13.612 --> 19:15.823
- Tickle.
- Go easy.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.324
Okay, be careful.

19:17.407 --> 19:22.204
Poke a bloody eye out.
Honest to God. Hello, new person.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.580
My friend Jenny.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.332
Hello, friend Jenny.
How you doing?

19:25.624 --> 19:27.584
Listen, we're gonna give breakfast a miss.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.253
He's been cooped up all day.
We're gonna go out.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.796
Let off some steam, all right?

19:30.879 --> 19:32.214
Cool.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.507
You gonna be all right?

19:33.924 --> 19:35.008
We'll be fine.

19:35.092 --> 19:38.929
All right. Denis, leave her alone.
She doesn't like it.

19:39.096 --> 19:42.015
Okay. You're too rough.
You're hurting my wrist!

19:43.183 --> 19:45.394
That was Cassidy.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.020
And company.

19:47.104 --> 19:48.105
He's cute.

19:50.858 --> 19:52.901
- Really?
- Oh, my God. Don't you think?

19:53.652 --> 19:54.862
No.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.489
So charming and damaged.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.449
And so bony.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.159
He is bony.

20:01.243 --> 20:04.121
That's how I like them.
All elbows and Adam's apples.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.459
That's funny.

20:10.961 --> 20:14.548
God is missing.
You know where He is?

20:17.467 --> 20:19.595
Preacher Custer is with me.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.394
Are you sure you want to know?

20:27.477 --> 20:30.230
Some things cannot be unheard.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.780
The Seraphim.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.034
A traitorous cabal of angels,

20:42.117 --> 20:44.077
jealous of God's authority,

20:44.578 --> 20:46.079
have rebelled against Him.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.833
They betrayed our Lord,

20:52.294 --> 20:54.004
and now He's on the run.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.759
And it's up to us to keep Him safe.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.348
Give me a break.

21:05.182 --> 21:06.183
What was that?

21:06.683 --> 21:08.894
I said, give me a break.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.521
- It's true.
- It's not remotely true.

21:13.023 --> 21:16.234
There is no coup.
God is not on the lam.

21:17.027 --> 21:18.528
He's simply moved on.

21:19.363 --> 21:23.700
The dinosaurs failed him.
And now, mankind has.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.662
He's gone to make a new creation.

21:27.245 --> 21:31.917
Something more loving. More just.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.252
More divine.

21:35.337 --> 21:39.216
So tell us,
what are some features of this new creation?

21:43.387 --> 21:47.182
The new species will be tall.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.142
My sources say 10 foot or more,

21:49.226 --> 21:53.397
with the prowess of a lion,
the flight of an eagle,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.857
and the honey badger's sense of smell.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.985
Honey badger?

21:58.068 --> 22:00.112
Do you hear yourself right now?

22:00.195 --> 22:03.490
Do you? God on the run
like a common criminal?

22:03.573 --> 22:05.242
Give me a break.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.035
So, no one knows where God is.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.204
Clearly, we do not.

22:09.788 --> 22:10.831
The boy.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.750
He knows. He has to.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.502
It's time for him to lead.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.421
All right, that's enough.

22:17.754 --> 22:18.922
Gentlemen.

22:20.549 --> 22:24.052
Thank you for coming by, saying hello.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.433
You see?

22:29.516 --> 22:34.563
The greatest minds in the world,
and we still can't find God.

22:34.646 --> 22:38.859
But with our resources and your power...

22:38.942 --> 22:40.277
Who is "the boy"?

22:41.987 --> 22:43.155
I'm sorry?

22:44.573 --> 22:48.827
"The boy. He knows.
It's time for him to lead."

22:50.245 --> 22:51.663
Who is "the boy"?

22:51.747 --> 22:53.206
You weren't supposed to hear that.

22:53.290 --> 22:54.291
Tell me.

22:57.669 --> 22:58.962
He's the Messiah.

23:07.012 --> 23:11.808
<i>Praise to the Lord, the Almighty</i>

23:11.892 --> 23:15.103
<i>The King of Creation</i>

23:15.937 --> 23:18.065
<i>O my soul, praise He</i>

23:19.524 --> 23:25.238
<i>For He is our health and salvation</i>

23:25.322 --> 23:28.200
<i>All ye who hear</i>

23:28.283 --> 23:32.662
<i>Now to the temple draw near</i>

23:32.954 --> 23:37.584
<i>Join in glad adoration</i>

23:41.838 --> 23:44.091
There, there.
Don't cry, little one.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.551
Your father died for a great cause,

23:47.511 --> 23:49.513
but we will protect you.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.431
And when the time comes,

23:52.349 --> 23:55.602
your bloodline shall ascend
and restore order.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.188
- Amen.
- Amen.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.482
Can I hold him?

24:09.366 --> 24:13.036
<i>And Thaddeus kept
his promise to the child.</i>

24:13.370 --> 24:18.125
And since then,
the Grail has protected Christ's lineage

24:18.208 --> 24:23.630
in preparation for one thing,
the end of the world.

24:23.713 --> 24:27.843
And at the moment
that hope is abandoned,

24:27.926 --> 24:32.889
our Savior will reveal Himself
to the frightened masses.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.226
End of speech.

24:37.394 --> 24:38.562
So what you're saying is,

24:38.645 --> 24:42.315
you have Jesus,
and he's gonna run the world.

24:42.566 --> 24:46.778
We have his 25th great-grandson,
but, yes, that's the plan.

24:46.862 --> 24:49.114
And this boy, does he know where God is?

24:49.197 --> 24:50.323
He hasn't said.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.616
Why not?

24:52.075 --> 24:56.037
The Messiah can sometimes be a bit

24:58.248 --> 24:59.749
unforthcoming.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.835
- Take me to him.
- Absolutely not.

25:01.918 --> 25:04.671
Very few people even know
of his existence, let alone...

25:04.754 --> 25:05.755
Take me to him.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.551
Okay.

25:09.634 --> 25:12.846
So to change gear,
put your left hand, all right?

25:12.929 --> 25:14.639
And then just squeeze back on the throttle.

25:14.723 --> 25:16.224
- Like this?
- Yeah.

25:16.308 --> 25:18.435
- And try not to crash, and that's it.
- Okay.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.312
Oh, my God, you're like
a sexy Evel Knievel.

25:20.395 --> 25:21.521
Who's that?

25:21.605 --> 25:25.108
What the bloody hell do you mean,
"Who's that?" Evel Knievel!

25:25.192 --> 25:27.110
No, I don't know who it is.

25:27.777 --> 25:29.112
What are you doing?

25:29.196 --> 25:31.573
Stop looking at me like that.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.200
What are you doing?

25:33.617 --> 25:35.952
Get off of me! Stop it!

25:36.161 --> 25:37.954
Stop! Someone help!

25:38.955 --> 25:41.041
Let's get out of here! Now!

25:41.124 --> 25:44.169
What's going on? What's up?

25:44.252 --> 25:45.962
<i>Game over.</i>

25:53.595 --> 25:54.930
What the hell just happened there?

25:58.975 --> 26:03.480
All right, son, look.
Listen to me. Your body's changed.

26:04.481 --> 26:07.567
And you've got a boat-load
of feelings rushing in, all right?

26:08.235 --> 26:10.153
New appetites. And it's normal.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.155
But some of these appetites,

26:12.239 --> 26:15.325
and you know the ones
I'm talking about, you just...

26:15.408 --> 26:16.576
You can't ever act on them.

26:16.660 --> 26:18.703
Ever. Do you understand?

26:45.522 --> 26:48.316
<i>I'll keep you my dirty little secret</i>

26:48.400 --> 26:50.485
Gosh.
How'd you get so good at video games?

26:50.819 --> 26:53.321
- My parents died.
- Oh.

26:54.406 --> 26:57.075
Yeah, I was put in a home
when I was nine.

26:57.742 --> 27:01.162
Assholes liked the government checks,
but hated the kids, so...

27:01.246 --> 27:03.081
They put you in front of the TV.

27:03.540 --> 27:04.582
Pretty much.

27:07.377 --> 27:08.878
<i>You're a rock star!</i>

27:09.879 --> 27:11.047
Your go.

27:11.339 --> 27:12.465
Nah, you go again.

27:13.341 --> 27:14.759
No, you have to play.

27:29.441 --> 27:30.483
This is hard.

27:30.567 --> 27:32.193
No, you'll get it.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.740
You're really lucky, you know.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.617
You've had such an awesome life.

27:39.701 --> 27:44.956
Like, acting in LA,
robbing banks in Dallas, looking for God...

27:46.416 --> 27:47.917
You're a survivor.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.338
And you get to do it all
with someone you love and trust.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.214
I've never had that.

27:56.468 --> 27:58.845
<i>Game over.</i>

28:01.890 --> 28:03.308
I never told you about Dallas.

28:04.142 --> 28:05.393
What?

28:05.769 --> 28:07.228
"Robbing banks in Dallas."

28:08.521 --> 28:09.981
I never told you that.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.026
Yeah. Yeah, you did. At breakfast.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.239
Maybe you just forgot.

28:19.449 --> 28:20.825
You were pretty upset.

28:26.623 --> 28:32.212
Yeah. Yeah, I was.
I was crying like a little baby, huh?

28:32.295 --> 28:35.173
No. You're good.

28:41.304 --> 28:42.931
Okay, hit me.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.436
Where's the bathroom?

28:49.187 --> 28:50.522
In the hall.

28:54.234 --> 28:55.652
Wrong way.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.406
Thanks.

29:16.339 --> 29:17.382
Go for Hoover.

29:17.841 --> 29:19.467
Listen carefully. I need your help.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.728
- Oh. Hey.
- Who are you?

29:30.812 --> 29:32.021
What do you mean? I'm Jenny.

29:32.730 --> 29:35.942
I didn't say anything about Dallas.
I know I didn't.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.611
Well, how else would I know about it?

29:38.695 --> 29:41.197
Right. That's why I'm asking.

29:43.408 --> 29:45.785
Yeah, I'm confused. You tell me.

29:45.869 --> 29:48.830
No, you tell me,
'cause you seem to know a whole lot.

29:49.414 --> 29:51.291
Tell me again why you got that gun?

29:52.542 --> 29:54.586
'Cause of Rodney. Like I said...

29:54.669 --> 29:56.421
There is no Rodney.

29:57.255 --> 29:59.090
Who are you?

30:00.216 --> 30:03.052
Honey, stop.
You're scaring me, okay?

30:04.053 --> 30:05.555
You sound kind of crazy.

30:06.264 --> 30:07.682
You listen to me.

30:08.308 --> 30:10.059
You got three seconds to come clean,

30:10.143 --> 30:12.979
or I will show you a whole world of crazy.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.776
Jenny? Jenny, open up!

30:19.402 --> 30:20.904
Oh, God. Oh, God.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.572
Jenny!

30:23.239 --> 30:25.950
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

30:26.951 --> 30:30.955
Jenny! Jenny!

30:31.915 --> 30:33.917
Jenny, open up!

30:34.417 --> 30:36.753
What are you doing here?
And stop yelling.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.087
The neighbors are gonna hear you.

30:38.463 --> 30:41.966
Jenny, you've got to come home. I'm sorry.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.843
You're drunk. Again.

30:43.927 --> 30:45.929
- I'm not. Okay? No. No, I'm not.
- Yes.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.306
Slow down, sweetie.
Come on. Look at you.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.766
I said I'm not drunk!

30:52.101 --> 30:53.895
You see what you make me do.

30:53.978 --> 30:56.147
You see what you make me do!

31:00.610 --> 31:02.487
Wait, wait, wait. Stop.

31:04.322 --> 31:05.615
Give me a turn.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.080
Time to go, Rodney.

31:33.268 --> 31:34.602
You think I broke his rib?

31:35.979 --> 31:37.021
Well, something cracked.

31:38.439 --> 31:39.816
I think I broke it.

31:40.400 --> 31:44.529
God! I just...
I never fought back before, you know?

31:45.446 --> 31:48.616
I feel so good.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.493
Good.

32:01.879 --> 32:03.506
Your tile's broken.

32:03.590 --> 32:04.924
Everything's broken.

32:05.008 --> 32:08.595
This whole building's a booby trap.
Hold still.

32:09.012 --> 32:10.388
Sorry.

32:12.307 --> 32:14.392
You should fix it. You're handy.

32:16.185 --> 32:19.022
Yeah. I am.

32:22.275 --> 32:25.111
Where are we going? Is he close?

32:25.194 --> 32:26.446
No.

33:07.111 --> 33:09.238
<i>Herr</i> Starr. What a surprise!

33:09.656 --> 33:11.991
The Allfather didn't tell us to expect you.

33:12.075 --> 33:14.077
It's a pleasant surprise.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.411
Yes, sir.

33:15.495 --> 33:16.579
Take us to him.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.373
- But...
- Now.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.857
Is he accepting an audience?

33:44.941 --> 33:47.443
Yes. He just had a bath.

33:47.527 --> 33:48.903
Leave us.

34:08.715 --> 34:13.970
Jesse, this is the Christ Child.

34:15.012 --> 34:20.643
The holy bloodline.
Our most precious figurehead.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.231
The Messiah.

34:47.503 --> 34:48.963
Look upon him.

34:54.218 --> 34:55.803
I...

34:57.305 --> 34:58.973
I don't know what to say.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.479
I'm just a humble...

35:08.524 --> 35:14.197
This power, I think I've been given it
to find your Father. God.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.825
Tell me. Am I on the right path?

35:18.659 --> 35:22.038
All I ever wanted was to serve you.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.042
Please.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.589
I don't even know what to call you.

35:32.632 --> 35:33.925
We call him

35:36.719 --> 35:38.054
Humperdoo.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.389
You call him...

35:44.519 --> 35:45.728
Ah.

35:45.812 --> 35:47.021
He likes you.

35:48.898 --> 35:52.902
Hello. Nice to meet yous.

35:54.654 --> 35:57.907
Is so happy to see yous.

36:00.368 --> 36:01.410
Who the hell is this?

36:01.869 --> 36:05.498
I told you. This is the Messiah.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.501
Humperdoo.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.587
Humperdoo? I Humperdoo.

36:12.088 --> 36:13.172
That's right.

36:13.256 --> 36:16.300
I Humperdoo.

36:16.759 --> 36:17.802
Good boy.

36:22.682 --> 36:23.683
Pee-pee?

36:23.766 --> 36:25.935
Very good, my Lord.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.274
Yes, come say hello.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.656
Shiny.

36:38.739 --> 36:40.449
Yes, it's my head.

36:41.284 --> 36:43.119
- Humperdoo like shiny.
- Thank you, Messiah.

36:43.411 --> 36:46.289
- Your amusement humbles me.
- Humperdoo like shiny!

36:46.789 --> 36:47.999
Now, now. All right.

36:48.082 --> 36:50.084
Shiny. Shiny. Humperdoo like shiny.

36:50.167 --> 36:53.045
Let's not become
too pleased, shall we?

36:58.384 --> 37:00.678
Yes. Now, calm yourself.

37:01.387 --> 37:06.976
He's in one of his agitated states.
We should leave before he discharges.

37:07.310 --> 37:08.519
Where is He?

37:11.480 --> 37:12.565
Where's God?

37:24.327 --> 37:25.328
Guards.

37:29.582 --> 37:31.417
I know. You're tired.

37:33.836 --> 37:35.338
Time for a nap.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.686
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.522
Me and Denis have just been here.
Check this out.

37:54.732 --> 37:56.484
- Pretty good, right?
- Hmm.

37:57.151 --> 37:58.110
What's it mean?

37:58.194 --> 38:00.279
What do you mean,
"What does it mean?" It's a bloody bird.

38:00.363 --> 38:02.323
Yep. No doubt about that.

38:02.406 --> 38:03.658
It's better than Denis's.

38:03.741 --> 38:05.952
He got a picture of Shemp,
from <i>The Three Stooges.</i>

38:07.244 --> 38:09.080
Shemp. Christ's sake.

38:09.163 --> 38:10.915
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

38:11.582 --> 38:14.877
I don't know, actually. He was...
He wanted some alone time. It's...

38:15.962 --> 38:18.381
You know, it's perfectly natural, I suppose.

38:20.049 --> 38:21.676
Do you wanna get stoned and play <i>Rock It?</i>

38:23.177 --> 38:24.637
- Sure.
- Awesome.

38:25.221 --> 38:26.597
But we only got drums.

38:28.766 --> 38:29.976
She go for it?

38:30.059 --> 38:31.394
Not yet.

38:31.477 --> 38:34.563
That junkie freak show
pulled her off to play video games.

38:41.946 --> 38:42.989
You sound like a woman.

38:47.243 --> 38:48.911
God, I wish I could have killed her.

38:49.245 --> 38:51.872
- Boss said not to.
- I know he said not to.

38:51.956 --> 38:53.249
That's why she's still alive.

38:53.332 --> 38:54.542
Why did he say that?

38:54.625 --> 38:57.003
Not our job to ask why.
All we have to do is...

38:57.086 --> 38:58.629
- Break them up.
- Exactly.

38:58.713 --> 39:01.549
Yeah, well, this should do it.

40:10.326 --> 40:11.702
So that's...

40:13.996 --> 40:16.373
He's the one that's gonna rule the world?

40:16.582 --> 40:21.378
Look, like with any royal family
or Maltese puppy,

40:21.462 --> 40:24.465
problems with inbreeding
are to be expected.

40:24.548 --> 40:28.052
You can't help me find God.
You never could.

40:29.220 --> 40:31.722
I never said I could help you find God.

40:31.806 --> 40:33.307
I said I could help you.

40:33.390 --> 40:34.517
What are you talking about?

40:35.059 --> 40:39.230
I was sodomized the other day.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.816
Forced against my will.

40:41.899 --> 40:47.696
A trio of local ruffians came to my office,
bent me over, and...

40:49.365 --> 40:51.117
Never mind.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.037
The point is, while it was happening,

40:56.205 --> 40:59.416
I thought of you. Your power.

41:00.209 --> 41:03.963
I've been head
of the Samson unit for over 13 years.

41:04.046 --> 41:06.298
I thought I was working for order,

41:06.382 --> 41:11.971
working to make a cleaner world
out of this shit-stained universe.

41:12.888 --> 41:14.390
Truth is,

41:15.516 --> 41:20.563
I've wasted my life serving
someone who cannot rule.

41:20.980 --> 41:23.149
I became disillusioned.

41:24.066 --> 41:26.235
What alternative did I have?

41:26.986 --> 41:28.404
Until now.

41:30.739 --> 41:34.743
I'm talking about you, Jesse Custer.

41:38.747 --> 41:40.583
You wanted me to use the Word.

41:41.876 --> 41:46.922
You wanted me to meet the Messiah.
That was your plan all along.

41:47.381 --> 41:48.883
God is gone.

41:50.259 --> 41:52.219
And nature abhors a vacuum.

41:52.303 --> 41:55.931
Sooner or later, someone will fill it.

41:57.349 --> 41:58.809
So I ask you,

41:59.977 --> 42:05.024
why go on looking for God
when you can just

42:07.943 --> 42:09.320
be Him?

42:11.947 --> 42:13.073
That is blasphemy.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.036
Semantics.

42:24.543 --> 42:27.338
Listen to me, you circle-jerking freak.

42:28.297 --> 42:30.966
There is only one true God.

42:31.425 --> 42:32.885
And I will find Him.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.894
Well, you can't find Him alone.

42:42.645 --> 42:44.730
Surely you've learned that by now.

42:52.238 --> 42:56.033
I'm not alone. I have friends.

42:56.116 --> 42:57.326
Do you?

42:57.785 --> 43:00.663
Yes, I do. And they're helping me.

43:01.747 --> 43:03.332
Are they?

43:10.089 --> 43:11.590
<i>Bonjour.</i>

43:18.430 --> 43:22.017
Anyway, think about it.
