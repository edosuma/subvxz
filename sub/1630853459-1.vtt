WEBVTT

00:12.291 --> 00:15.916
You refer to the prophecy of the
one who will bring balance to the Force.

00:17.416 --> 00:19.166
You believe it's this boy?

00:23.375 --> 00:26.625
Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

00:28.416 --> 00:31.250
<i>Clouded this boy's future is.</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:36.375
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.583
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.875
Impossible to take on a second.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.416
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.000
<i>You've been a good apprentice,</i>
<i>Obi-Wan.</i>

00:54.458 --> 00:56.166
No!

00:57.166 --> 00:59.291
<i>I foresee you will become</i>
<i>a great Jedi Knight.</i>

00:59.375 --> 01:00.833
Obi-Wan.

01:00.916 --> 01:02.916
Promise me you will train the boy.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.500
Yes, Master.

01:04.583 --> 01:08.000
He will bring balance.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.541
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

01:12.208 --> 01:15.000
<i>Your apprentice Skywalker will be.</i>

01:19.541 --> 01:20.541
What took you so long?

01:23.583 --> 01:25.250
<i>Obi-Wan is a great mentor.</i>

01:26.208 --> 01:27.500
<i>As wise as Master Yoda</i>

01:28.958 --> 01:30.875
<i>and as powerful as Master Windu.</i>

01:31.500 --> 01:33.791
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

01:35.458 --> 01:38.333
<i>I see you becoming</i>
<i>the greatest of all the Jedi.</i>

01:39.666 --> 01:40.708
<i>I feel lost.</i>

01:41.833 --> 01:44.708
Lost? What do you mean?

01:44.791 --> 01:47.416
<i>I'm not the Jedi I should be.</i>
<i>I want more.</i>

01:48.083 --> 01:49.083
And I know I shouldn't.

01:50.041 --> 01:51.791
<i>How do you know the ways of the Force?</i>

01:52.875 --> 01:55.541
My mentor taught me everything
about the Force.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.291
Even the nature of the dark side

02:00.916 --> 02:02.500
Only through me

02:02.583 --> 02:06.208
can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi.

02:06.416 --> 02:08.125
I can't.

02:08.583 --> 02:09.708
Don't give up, Padmé.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.333
<i>The power to save Padmé.</i>

02:14.083 --> 02:16.166
I found a way to save you.

02:16.250 --> 02:21.250
<i>Twisted by the dark side</i>
<i>young Skywalker has become.</i>

02:22.875 --> 02:25.708
The boy you trained, gone he is.

02:25.791 --> 02:27.250
I will not kill Anakin.

02:29.791 --> 02:31.958
This is the end for you, my master.

02:32.583 --> 02:33.958
I have failed you, Anakin.

02:34.916 --> 02:35.916
I have failed you.

02:37.708 --> 02:40.708
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

02:40.791 --> 02:43.458
You underestimate my power.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.208
You were the Chosen One!

02:48.291 --> 02:51.166
It was said that you would
destroy the Sith, not join them!

02:54.125 --> 02:55.666
He's still alive.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.833
<i>You were my brother, Anakin.</i>

03:05.166 --> 03:09.958
<i>You shall be known</i>
<i>as Darth Vader.</i>

03:11.166 --> 03:12.250
Obi-Wan?

03:13.041 --> 03:14.833
There's good in him.

03:16.958 --> 03:18.041
<i>Rise.</i>

03:20.916 --> 03:24.500
<i>Hidden,</i>
<i>safe the children must be kept.</i>

03:27.250 --> 03:28.583
<i>We must take them somewhere</i>

03:28.666 --> 03:30.708
<i>where the Sith</i>
<i>will not sense their presence.</i>

03:32.041 --> 03:33.791
My wife and I will take the girl.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.916
<i>We've always talked</i>
<i>of adopting a baby girl.</i>

03:37.708 --> 03:38.708
<i>Leia.</i>

03:38.791 --> 03:39.791
And what of the boy?

03:40.208 --> 03:41.208
<i>Luke.</i>

03:41.375 --> 03:44.000
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

03:44.083 --> 03:46.041
I will take the child and watch over him.

03:48.083 --> 03:49.333
<i>In your solitude...</i>

03:50.041 --> 03:51.875
<i>training I have for you.</i>

03:51.958 --> 03:53.916
<i>Your old master.</i>

03:54.458 --> 03:57.541
<i>How to commune with him I will teach you.</i>

04:54.375 --> 04:55.875
This way! Quick!

05:01.083 --> 05:02.083
Come on! Let's go!

05:02.166 --> 05:04.416
- Let's go!
- This way!

05:07.083 --> 05:08.083
Come on! Let's go!

05:08.166 --> 05:10.500
- This way.
- Hurry!

05:12.208 --> 05:13.666
Watch out!

05:17.000 --> 05:18.750
Come on! Move! Quick!

05:23.291 --> 05:26.000
- Go. Come on! Go. Go! Go!
- Run! This way! Hurry!

05:36.208 --> 05:37.375
No!

05:41.750 --> 05:42.750
What do we do now?

05:43.625 --> 05:44.625
We run.

05:47.875 --> 05:50.875
<i>Execute Order 66.</i>

05:51.750 --> 05:54.916
<i>Execute Order 66.</i>

05:55.958 --> 05:59.375
<i>Execute Order 66.</i>

08:31.583 --> 08:34.250
You know who we are.

08:34.916 --> 08:35.916
Inquisitors.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.958
You know what we do?

08:38.041 --> 08:39.291
You hunt Jedi.

08:39.375 --> 08:44.541
In actuality, I would say
the Jedi hunt themselves.

08:49.541 --> 08:53.458
Do you know the key
to hunting a Jedi, friend?

08:54.750 --> 08:56.583
It is patience.

08:59.583 --> 09:02.083
Jedi cannot help what they are.

09:03.708 --> 09:06.291
Their compassion leaves a trail.

09:07.166 --> 09:13.250
For example,
in our line of work, rumors run rampant.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Here's one I heard just recently.

09:16.083 --> 09:21.416
It involves a Jedi hiding right here
in your lovely saloon.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.166
Let's say ours is a wanderer.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.666
Maybe he's looking for people like him.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.583
Comes across this establishment.

09:33.666 --> 09:34.750
Nice place.

09:36.250 --> 09:39.833
And then he sees you.

09:41.750 --> 09:42.916
A man in need.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.750
Perhaps the locals are stealing from you.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.458
Threatening you.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.791
So what is the Jedi to do?

09:56.708 --> 10:00.166
Help you and risk exposure?

10:02.250 --> 10:03.333
Or move on?

10:04.541 --> 10:09.833
Now, if he were smart, he'd keep moving,
but the Jedi Code is like an itch.

10:09.916 --> 10:11.750
He cannot help it.

10:11.833 --> 10:15.208
So he steps in and saves your saloon.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.833
You offer him a place to hide.

10:17.916 --> 10:20.291
Fresh water, shade from the suns,

10:20.375 --> 10:24.541
but the stories, they begin
and they travel quickly.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.666
His compassion has been his undoing.

10:34.375 --> 10:35.458
There.

10:42.916 --> 10:44.416
Prepare him for interrogation.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.958
You're wasting your time.
You know that, right?

10:47.833 --> 10:48.958
You'll never find us all.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.166
You are reckless.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.625
Why chase after scraps?

11:07.708 --> 11:10.041
Scraps are all we have left.

11:10.125 --> 11:11.750
Then we should be hunting bigger prey.

11:11.833 --> 11:14.958
He is not yours to find.
We are past this, Third Sister.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.916
I will not warn you again.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.458
You will forget this fixation with Kenobi,
or I will relieve you of your duties.

11:21.541 --> 11:22.625
Is that clear?

11:24.875 --> 11:27.083
Yes, Grand Inquisitor.

11:32.916 --> 11:34.541
Consider him forgotten.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.083
It's only half.

13:15.958 --> 13:16.958
Please, I have a family.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.833
One more word, I take it all.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.500
Keep moving.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.458
Something you want to say?

16:14.875 --> 16:16.208
You're late.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.416
Do you have it?

16:28.916 --> 16:30.333
I'll give you...

16:31.250 --> 16:32.458
I'll give you 50.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.833
Yes, I had some parts stolen.
I need a new processor board.

16:50.125 --> 16:53.458
Teeka, if you're gonna steal my parts
and then sell them back to me,

16:53.541 --> 16:56.416
could you at least clean them first
as a courtesy?

17:20.375 --> 17:21.375
A Jedi?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.541
Well, don't count on it.

17:33.541 --> 17:35.916
I've heard the Jedi are all but extinct.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.166
Here.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.166
Well, thank you, Teeka. Goodbye.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.375
<i>I know there's…</i>

18:05.208 --> 18:06.583
<i>You were my brother, Anakin!</i>

18:09.541 --> 18:11.583
- Promise me you will train the boy.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.166
<i>Obi-Wan...</i>

18:14.916 --> 18:17.333
- <i>Only pain will you find.</i>

18:18.041 --> 18:20.208
<i>There's good in him.</i>
<i>I know there's...</i>

18:21.083 --> 18:22.375
<i>You were the Chosen One!</i>

18:24.458 --> 18:25.625
I hate you!

18:47.416 --> 18:48.500
Master Qui-Gon.

18:52.708 --> 18:53.791
Master?

19:46.833 --> 19:49.500
Grab two of those canisters.

20:02.708 --> 20:03.791
Luke?

20:08.750 --> 20:09.833
Luke!

20:10.666 --> 20:11.666
Luke!

20:11.750 --> 20:13.583
Did he go back inside?

20:13.666 --> 20:14.750
He's run off.

20:16.791 --> 20:17.875
Luke?

20:23.708 --> 20:24.791
Luke?

20:29.750 --> 20:30.833
Luke?

21:40.166 --> 21:41.250
Master.

21:42.666 --> 21:44.916
I thought I saw you in the town,
but I wasn't sure.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.541
I didn't think you'd survived.

21:46.625 --> 21:48.625
You're making some kind of mistake.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.250
I'm sorry, my name is Nari.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.208
Um, there's no mistake.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.541
You're looking for somebody else.

21:56.791 --> 21:58.208
What are you doing here, Obi-Wan?

21:58.291 --> 21:59.416
My name is Ben.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.333
Come on, please.

22:01.833 --> 22:02.916
Please.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.333
You have no idea what I've been through.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.166
You must leave.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.375
You'll draw too much attention.

22:23.458 --> 22:24.750
But I have nowhere to go.

22:24.833 --> 22:27.208
They're hunting me. You have to help me.

22:28.750 --> 22:29.833
You want my help?

22:30.291 --> 22:31.375
Take this.

22:31.875 --> 22:34.708
Walk into the middle of the desert
and bury it in the ground.

22:37.416 --> 22:38.416
Stay hidden.

22:40.208 --> 22:41.208
Live a normal life.

22:41.291 --> 22:44.125
What about the people that need us?
What about the fight?

22:45.458 --> 22:46.625
The fight is done.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.583
We lost.

22:51.041 --> 22:52.125
What happened to you?

22:54.166 --> 22:55.666
You were once a great Jedi.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.833
The time of the Jedi is over.

23:06.291 --> 23:07.583
Go back to the town.

23:08.791 --> 23:09.875
Let it go.

23:55.208 --> 23:56.666
We're going to be late.

23:56.750 --> 23:58.625
Come on, let's hurry it along.

23:58.708 --> 23:59.708
How is she doing?

23:59.791 --> 24:00.791
She's ready?

24:01.375 --> 24:02.458
Great.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.333
Thank you.

24:04.416 --> 24:06.875
Remember,
my sister's whole family is coming.

24:07.375 --> 24:08.666
We need their support.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.333
So try not to make anyone cry.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.875
There will be sweetmallows
at the reception after.

24:13.583 --> 24:16.000
If you behave, I will let you...

24:21.875 --> 24:24.666
She insisted
you would find it amusing, Your Highness.

24:29.750 --> 24:32.000
She's either in the cellar,
in the kitchen...

24:32.833 --> 24:34.541
...or in the woods.

25:15.541 --> 25:16.958
Medical freighter.

25:18.458 --> 25:20.333
Pleasure barge, boring.

25:22.083 --> 25:24.083
Casino ship? Not bad.

25:26.416 --> 25:28.416
Ooh. A Tri-wing. That's a new one.

25:29.791 --> 25:31.625
Ooh. An Aquillian Ranger.

25:31.708 --> 25:35.083
Probably scouting for Merson pirates.

25:36.750 --> 25:38.750
No? Trader, maybe?

25:38.833 --> 25:40.000
Leia Organa!

25:41.875 --> 25:43.625
You had to do this today?

25:43.708 --> 25:44.708
Do what?

25:44.791 --> 25:45.875
Down.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.791
It is like raising a Glor-ag.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.041
No Lola for the rest of the day.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.166
But she didn't do anything.

26:02.250 --> 26:03.250
Shut her down.

26:04.791 --> 26:05.875
I mean it.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.458
If you behaved as well as you climb,

26:16.000 --> 26:17.625
you'd be a senator already.

26:19.666 --> 26:22.125
You'll have to change
in the speeder. Come.

26:22.208 --> 26:25.625
It's not like anyone would miss me
if I wasn't there.

26:25.708 --> 26:26.791
I'd miss you.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.625
All I ever do is wave.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.291
Then do more than wave.

26:30.375 --> 26:32.500
You get out of this what you put into it.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.416
I'm sorry, Mother.

26:36.083 --> 26:37.416
I really am.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.291
I promise I won't do it again.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.958
You know, I can feel you doing that.

26:49.666 --> 26:50.666
Come on.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.666
It's like living in a prison.

26:52.750 --> 26:53.833
A prison?

27:52.291 --> 27:53.958
I want you to stay away from him.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.041
We don't need anything from you, Ben.

27:57.125 --> 27:58.708
It's just a toy.

27:58.791 --> 28:00.333
It's a lot more than that.

28:00.416 --> 28:03.208
There's more to life than your farm, Owen.

28:03.291 --> 28:06.208
He needs to see that.
There's a whole galaxy out there.

28:06.291 --> 28:09.583
I'm asking you to leave us alone, Ben.

28:09.666 --> 28:10.666
I mean it.

28:11.166 --> 28:12.166
Is he okay?

28:13.500 --> 28:15.375
You don't care if he's okay.

28:16.666 --> 28:18.000
You care if he's showing.

28:18.083 --> 28:19.791
He's my responsibility, Owen.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.541
- I'm his uncle.
- We talked about this.

28:21.625 --> 28:24.041
When the time comes, he must be trained.

28:24.125 --> 28:25.500
Like you trained his father?

28:27.083 --> 28:29.166
Anakin is dead, Ben,

28:30.750 --> 28:33.166
and I won't let you
make the same mistake twice.

28:34.500 --> 28:38.166
So, leave him on the farm with his family,
where he belongs.

28:40.791 --> 28:42.791
Move. Now.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.166
- Get back.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.416
All of you.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.041
Out of the way.

28:53.625 --> 28:54.791
Back up.

29:00.458 --> 29:02.291
You know why we are here.

29:04.125 --> 29:08.291
There is a Jedi hiding on this planet.

29:08.375 --> 29:10.916
We need to know where he is.

29:12.291 --> 29:13.750
You will be rewarded well.

29:13.833 --> 29:14.875
Or you'll be punished!

29:14.958 --> 29:16.000
Reva!

29:16.083 --> 29:17.625
Hands go first!

29:19.916 --> 29:22.583
That way, when you reach for anything,

29:25.208 --> 29:26.291
you think of us.

29:31.791 --> 29:33.375
This is the Outer Rim.

29:34.625 --> 29:36.208
You have no rights here.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.541
We're not under the Empire's...

29:41.375 --> 29:43.416
All we want is information.

29:44.166 --> 29:49.916
If anyone knows anything about a Jedi...

29:55.375 --> 29:56.541
You know something?

30:04.375 --> 30:05.458
What's your name?

30:06.708 --> 30:07.833
Owen.

30:08.791 --> 30:09.875
Owen.

30:10.291 --> 30:11.625
Farmer, right?

30:13.041 --> 30:14.041
Wife?

30:14.125 --> 30:15.125
Kids?

30:16.541 --> 30:17.958
My family's of no concern to you.

30:18.041 --> 30:19.333
They might be.

30:19.416 --> 30:22.041
- You got a Jedi on that farm, too?
- No.

30:22.125 --> 30:23.375
Why should I believe you?

30:23.458 --> 30:25.250
I have no love for the Jedi.

30:26.375 --> 30:27.458
Jedi are vermin.

30:28.625 --> 30:30.333
I kill vermin on my farm.

30:31.333 --> 30:32.833
You protect your family.

30:35.541 --> 30:36.791
I like that, Owen.

30:39.625 --> 30:40.625
It's important.

30:47.916 --> 30:50.000
You think you could protect them from me?

30:53.958 --> 30:59.375
Tell me where the Jedi is,
or this man and his family die!

31:02.375 --> 31:03.875
The Jedi are cowards.

31:05.958 --> 31:07.791
They failed you,

31:07.875 --> 31:10.625
abandoned you.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.916
There is no point in protecting them.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.041
They would not do the same for you.

31:20.625 --> 31:22.166
But you can save this man.

31:28.666 --> 31:30.291
- Save his family.

31:36.583 --> 31:37.708
Enough!

31:39.458 --> 31:41.291
If you remember anything,

31:41.833 --> 31:43.416
rewards will be given.

31:45.916 --> 31:47.916
Stand down, Third Sister.

31:50.166 --> 31:51.250
Now!

31:53.708 --> 31:55.125
Next time, Owen.

32:01.541 --> 32:03.125
Ah! Move.

32:12.208 --> 32:15.166
You are too impulsive.

32:15.750 --> 32:17.250
I'm sick of wasting time!

32:18.000 --> 32:19.666
This place is beneath us!

32:20.250 --> 32:22.000
The Grand Inquisitor was right.

32:23.541 --> 32:25.083
You still want Kenobi.

32:26.958 --> 32:30.083
But he's gone, and you won't find him.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.458
We spent the last ten years
looking for him.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.458
Maybe you've been looking
in the wrong places.

32:38.333 --> 32:41.750
What is it you think you will gain
by capturing him?

32:43.125 --> 32:44.333
What I'm owed.

32:49.666 --> 32:51.583
Be careful, Third Sister.

32:51.666 --> 32:53.416
You go too far.

32:55.291 --> 32:57.041
Maybe you don't go far enough.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.125
Thank you, Owen.

33:15.416 --> 33:16.875
I didn't do it for you.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.000
Right on time as always.

33:56.083 --> 33:57.416
Anything good today?

33:57.500 --> 33:59.958
A trade ship and an Aquillian Ranger.

34:00.041 --> 34:01.791
Probably scouring for pirates.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.416
That's what I said.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.375
- Don't encourage her.
- All right.

34:08.666 --> 34:09.875
Come now.

34:09.958 --> 34:11.583
Let's get this over with.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.041
- Breha.
- Sister.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.375
- Greetings.
- Hi, cousin.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.375
Princess.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.791
- Oh, there they are.

34:27.875 --> 34:29.041
Princess.

34:30.083 --> 34:31.416
Hi, Princess.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.041
Profits have been good.

34:45.916 --> 34:50.958
After the disaster of the Republic,
the Empire is finally lining some pockets.

34:51.041 --> 34:53.750
There are still some issues
that we need to address.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.791
Slave labor, taxation of the Outer Rim...

34:56.875 --> 34:59.375
I didn't come here to end slavery, Bail.

35:00.041 --> 35:01.750
I came to eat your food.

35:02.541 --> 35:04.208
Save the bleeding heart for the Senate.

35:04.916 --> 35:06.833
A drink, Senator?

35:08.416 --> 35:10.125
- Ah. Thank you.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.083
Your Highness.

35:15.375 --> 35:16.791
Oh. Thanks, Y-O.

35:16.875 --> 35:17.958
My pleasure.

35:19.125 --> 35:20.333
You thank your droids?

35:20.958 --> 35:22.458
It's good manners.

35:22.541 --> 35:25.458
You don't need manners
when you're talking to a lower life form.

35:25.541 --> 35:28.708
Then I guess I don't need manners
when I'm talking to you.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.583
You know the difference
between you and me, cousin?

35:34.291 --> 35:35.291
I know things.

35:35.875 --> 35:38.458
My father says
they never let you leave this planet.

35:39.666 --> 35:43.250
They don't want anybody to know about you
because you're not one of us.

35:44.291 --> 35:45.791
You're not even a real Organa.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.916
You're scared of him.

35:53.125 --> 35:56.666
Your father. You want him to like you,
so you repeat what he says

35:56.750 --> 35:59.166
even though you don't really know
what it means.

36:00.041 --> 36:02.833
You think being like him
will make people frightened of you,

36:02.916 --> 36:05.583
but really, you're the one who's scared.

36:05.666 --> 36:08.416
You've never made one decision
for yourself in your entire life,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.208
and you never will.

36:11.041 --> 36:13.833
I may not have seen much, cousin,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.250
but I can see that.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.666
He was being horrible to everyone.

36:24.750 --> 36:25.875
He's your cousin.

36:25.958 --> 36:27.458
He's rude to droids.

36:27.541 --> 36:29.791
You have to rise above, Leia.

36:32.541 --> 36:33.875
You owe him an apology.

36:34.333 --> 36:37.291
I'd rather be digested by a jakobeast.

36:49.125 --> 36:53.541
I wanted to live out way past Kathou
when I was your age.

36:54.500 --> 36:57.333
Chase purrgil, you know?

36:57.416 --> 36:58.916
I had a whole plan.

37:00.708 --> 37:01.708
What happened?

37:02.458 --> 37:03.541
I got older.

37:04.416 --> 37:06.458
Had to find some other adventures.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.208
Started chasing your mother instead.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.666
This is your future, Leia.

37:14.458 --> 37:17.458
In a few years, you'll be
off to university, then Junior Senate.

37:17.541 --> 37:18.541
The Senate's boring.

37:18.625 --> 37:21.041
It's people in itchy clothes arguing.

37:21.125 --> 37:24.041
Well, it may seem so...

37:24.125 --> 37:25.375
I don't want to be a senator.

37:25.916 --> 37:28.583
It is why
you'll probably be one of the best.

37:29.791 --> 37:31.750
I'm not even a real Organa.

37:32.666 --> 37:33.666
What?

37:38.416 --> 37:39.416
Don't ever say that.

37:41.541 --> 37:42.708
You are our child.

37:44.125 --> 37:48.250
You are an Organa in every way.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.666
One day, this planet
will look to you, Leia.

37:54.916 --> 37:56.416
There are many ways to lead.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.750
You just have to find yours.

37:58.833 --> 38:01.500
Plus, imagine the look
on your cousin's face

38:01.583 --> 38:03.666
when you get to boss him around for real.

38:07.708 --> 38:08.791
But for now,

38:10.666 --> 38:11.750
we will...

38:13.541 --> 38:14.708
apologize.

38:15.666 --> 38:16.666
Yes, Father.

38:16.750 --> 38:17.750
Hmm.

38:22.666 --> 38:24.166
I'll wait for you downstairs.

38:40.583 --> 38:41.666
Thank you.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.333
She's gone.

38:43.541 --> 38:45.750
I thought you said
you've really got through to her.

38:46.250 --> 38:47.416
You know what she's like.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.916
I know who she's like.

38:49.666 --> 38:50.833
Send a unit.

38:50.916 --> 38:51.916
She can't be far.

38:59.333 --> 39:00.958
Hello, Princess.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.333
Why are you here?

39:05.375 --> 39:06.458
Just waiting.

39:06.916 --> 39:08.250
For what?

39:08.916 --> 39:10.250
For you.

39:51.208 --> 39:52.291
Help!

39:53.750 --> 39:54.833
Help!

39:56.250 --> 39:57.833
Help! Help me, please!

40:37.291 --> 40:38.875
<i>We don't know who it was.</i>

40:38.958 --> 40:40.583
<i>No ransom, no leads.</i>

40:41.916 --> 40:46.041
<i>Whoever they are,</i>
<i>they knew where she would be. They...</i>

40:46.750 --> 40:47.833
<i>They were waiting.</i>

40:49.208 --> 40:51.125
<i>She needs you, Obi-Wan.</i>

40:52.166 --> 40:53.666
<i>We can't trust anyone else.</i>

40:55.833 --> 40:57.250
What about the Senate?

40:57.750 --> 40:59.500
<i>We cannot let this become public.</i>

41:00.166 --> 41:01.916
<i>It would draw too much attention.</i>

41:02.750 --> 41:05.666
Well, your guard then? Or a bounty hunter?

41:05.750 --> 41:09.833
<i>Only you know how important</i>
<i>she really is, Obi-Wan.</i>

41:09.916 --> 41:11.500
<i>If Leia is discovered...</i>

41:11.583 --> 41:13.166
I can't leave here, Bail.

41:14.375 --> 41:15.541
My duty is to the boy...

41:15.625 --> 41:17.541
<i>What about your duty to his sister?</i>

41:19.375 --> 41:21.208
<i>She's as important as he is.</i>

41:27.416 --> 41:28.916
It's been ten years.

41:32.625 --> 41:34.041
I'm not who I used to be.

41:40.166 --> 41:41.250
Find someone else.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.041
She'll be better off.

41:47.791 --> 41:50.250
Let go of me!

41:50.333 --> 41:51.791
- Let go!
- Shut her up.

43:37.250 --> 43:38.833
She's headed for Daiyu.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.750
You should not have come.

43:43.708 --> 43:46.083
They hid their signature
behind a freight transport.

43:46.166 --> 43:48.000
The ship is on its way there now.

43:48.750 --> 43:49.791
I can't.

43:49.875 --> 43:51.625
She's my daughter, Obi-Wan.

43:51.708 --> 43:52.875
I told you...

43:53.958 --> 43:55.416
I'm not the man you remember.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.833
You're going to have to be!

43:56.916 --> 43:58.041
I can't leave the boy.

43:58.125 --> 44:00.041
This isn't about the boy, and you know it!

44:01.166 --> 44:03.125
You've made mistakes. We all did.

44:03.208 --> 44:04.458
It's the past.

44:05.416 --> 44:06.916
Move on. Be done with it.

44:07.958 --> 44:09.625
You couldn't save Anakin,

44:11.583 --> 44:12.916
but you can save her.

44:15.541 --> 44:16.791
And what if I can't?

44:19.166 --> 44:22.083
There is no one
I trust more with my child than you.

44:23.958 --> 44:26.666
Please, old friend.

44:28.416 --> 44:29.500
For her.

44:30.875 --> 44:32.125
One last fight.

44:41.833 --> 44:44.916
Come on, Lola. Come on.

44:58.625 --> 45:00.125
Can you untie me?

45:08.458 --> 45:10.166
I'm not afraid of you.

45:12.250 --> 45:13.416
Give it time.

45:19.291 --> 45:20.416
Lola!

45:21.791 --> 45:24.083
My father will rescue me!

45:24.166 --> 45:26.125
He'll send a whole army!

45:26.708 --> 45:28.541
No one's coming for you.

46:25.625 --> 46:26.875
This is a bad idea.

46:27.625 --> 46:28.708
Kidnapping kids...

46:30.333 --> 46:31.500
you think it's gonna work?

46:32.083 --> 46:33.500
Just get this over with.

47:14.333 --> 47:15.666
You sure he's gonna come?

47:16.541 --> 47:18.708
<i>He fought beside her father</i>
<i>during the war.</i>

47:19.666 --> 47:20.750
<i>He'll come.</i>

47:21.750 --> 47:23.250
<i>He won't be able to help it.</i>

47:24.458 --> 47:26.708
<i>The Jedi will hunt himself.</i>

47:53.916 --> 47:55.375
Well?

47:55.458 --> 47:56.625
You coming or not?
