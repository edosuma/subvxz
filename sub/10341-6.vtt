WEBVTT

01:42.310 --> 01:44.895
I trusted you.

01:46.314 --> 01:49.942
I invested my heart and soul in you.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.402
- We only want to read it.
- We didn't mean any harm.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.030
I thought you were different.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.533
You made me feel

01:58.201 --> 02:00.077
I could return to the world

02:00.286 --> 02:06.542
and find something decent, pure.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.128
But you're just like all the others.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.255
You lie.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.173
And you betray.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.008
And then you laugh about it!

02:15.510 --> 02:18.178
You are unclean.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.974
You have contaminated me.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.061
- Now give it to me.
- Aah!

02:30.608 --> 02:32.484
- Donna.
- Donna!

02:33.611 --> 02:35.445
No.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.494
He's not coming. He won't.
He's afraid.

02:43.746 --> 02:48.542
- Did he hurt you? Are you okay?
- No. I'm fine. I'm fine. I...

02:51.379 --> 02:53.755
I'm sorry, James. It's all my fault.

02:53.965 --> 02:58.468
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, don't cry. It's my fault too.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.762
We gotta go to the sheriff now, okay?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.639
You've had enough trouble.
I'll go.

03:02.849 --> 03:08.103
- No, I'll go.
- James, just hold me, okay? Okay.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.667
We're all set up inside.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.223
Sluggish pulse.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.184
Pupils constricted.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.104
Breathing slow and shallow.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.986
Needle marks. Most likely heroin.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.821
Poor kid.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.781
Daddy?

04:43.449 --> 04:47.536
Can you see me?
Can you see me, Daddy?

04:47.745 --> 04:49.621
Audrey, you got to stay awake.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.207
Can you catch me?

04:52.417 --> 04:55.127
- Can you?
- Audrey.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.170
Talk to me, Audrey.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.881
Stay awake. Audrey?

05:00.091 --> 05:02.384
His tongue is so heavy.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.137
The hand on my throat.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.597
It hurts me.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.517
Oh, God, it hurts me.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.020
Black cold.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.564
I can't breathe.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.566
Help me, please, help me.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.861
I'm sinking. I'm sinking.

05:21.070 --> 05:25.240
All right. It's all right, Audrey,
I'm right here. Audrey, I'm right here.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.291
I prayed.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.337
I prayed that you would come.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.048
And you did.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.475
It's okay. It's okay.

05:54.103 --> 05:58.106
She was so brave. I feel terrible.
If anything had happened to her...

05:58.316 --> 06:02.069
No more plans, okay?
No more going off on our own.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.781
James, he has Laura's secret diary.
He could have killed her.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.325
He could have killed you too.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.037
Pretty stupid, huh?

06:12.497 --> 06:15.123
Well, after Laura died,

06:15.291 --> 06:17.209
everything just went by kind of fast,
you know.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.795
It's hard to know exactly
what to believe in.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.630
Yeah.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.634
But when I saw you tonight,
I knew exactly what I believed.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.928
Did you?

06:28.679 --> 06:30.514
It's like if we could put
our hearts together

06:30.681 --> 06:34.768
and keep them that way forever,
we'd be safe, no matter what.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.812
You and me?

06:37.605 --> 06:39.356
From now on.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.900
Yes.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.420
How is she?

07:02.004 --> 07:03.630
She is through the worst of it.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.134
Heroin, Harry.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.803
This close to a lethal dose.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.557
Hard to imagine such cruelty.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.518
Not really.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.853
Look at this.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.938
Blackie's killer.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.982
I knew I'd seen him before.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.734
- Jean Renault.
- Renault?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.028
Oldest brother
of Jacques and Bernard.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.530
Hell of a lot more dangerous.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.574
He runs the northern territories.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.869
Gambling, drugs, extortion,
you name it.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.997
Now, I saw

07:37.165 --> 07:39.791
a tape on the TV in Blackie's office
of you

07:40.001 --> 07:43.420
playing blackjack the night
you and Big Ed went to the casino.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.006
Jean Renault was after me.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.258
The man who caught his brother.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.095
He planned to kill me
and he used Audrey as bait.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.142
I went out of my jurisdiction.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.518
Twice.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.312
I've violated my professional code

08:00.480 --> 08:02.481
and now Audrey is paying the price.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.526
You got her back.
And she's gonna be okay.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.571
This isn't the first time my actions
have brought suffering to someone

08:09.739 --> 08:13.074
I care about, in the name
of doing what I had to do.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.076
Damn it. I should have known better.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.037
Doesn't change the fact
that she's here now,

08:17.205 --> 08:19.414
not up at Jack's with a needle
in her arm.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.839
You know,

08:28.007 --> 08:30.592
you are the best lawman

08:30.968 --> 08:32.636
I've ever seen.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.095
But, Coop,

08:34.305 --> 08:36.431
sometimes you think too much.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.644
Thank you, Harry.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.667
Agent Cooper.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.794
I got your call.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.880
What happened? Did you, uh?

09:09.090 --> 09:12.509
I was able to free your daughter
without the payment.

09:14.428 --> 09:15.845
Thank God.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.473
She was being held at a brothel
north of the border,

09:18.641 --> 09:20.976
known as One-Eyed Jack's.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.519
No.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.398
It seems the brothel's madam
was at least partially responsible

09:26.607 --> 09:29.192
for her kidnapping
and subsequent blackmail.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.361
Did you arrest her?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.864
She was killed
before I could question her.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.825
No.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.036
Murdered by a man named
Jean Renault.

09:40.955 --> 09:44.499
This Jean Renault,
did you catch him?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.918
He escaped.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.506
Too bad.

09:53.634 --> 09:58.388
Well, everything seems to be
in order.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.057
Your daughter is recovering
from a drug overdose.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.105
Drug overdose?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.025
Oh, my God.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.485
She's gonna be all right.

10:13.821 --> 10:14.946
Can I see her?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.616
She's resting comfortably now,
I wouldn't disturb her.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.118
I'll call you in the morning.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.497
Yes.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.917
Yes, you do that, Agent Cooper.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.961
Thank you.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.799
Thank you

10:35.009 --> 10:37.636
for bringing my Audrey back to me.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.308
Good night, Mr. Horne.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.394
Poor fellow is really gone.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.270
You ain't kidding.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.065
Oh, I want you to know
how much I admire you kids,

11:32.233 --> 11:33.900
standing by Mr. Johnson.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.194
Not taking the easy way out.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.571
Most people would just ship him off.

11:38.781 --> 11:42.951
Yeah, well, Leo's sort of special
to us both.

11:43.577 --> 11:49.249
Believe you me, in-home care
is the stuff of miracles.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.793
Mr. Johnson should benefit
tremendously

11:51.961 --> 11:54.212
from being here
among his loved ones.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.714
Oh, we certainly hope so.

11:55.881 --> 11:59.718
Mm. Will you be hiring
full- or part-time help?

12:00.928 --> 12:04.723
Um, Cousin Bobby and I
will be here full-time.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.352
I just admire your dedication.

12:12.064 --> 12:15.275
Well, everything looks to be in order.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.653
You might want to childproof
those electrical sockets.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.863
Okay.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.698
Please sign right there.

12:27.788 --> 12:31.332
- Mm-hm. Your check.
- Thank you.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.173
Um, there must be a mistake.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.765
- Seven hundred bucks?
- Sad, isn't it?

12:46.974 --> 12:50.059
The cost of health care
is going through the roof.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.936
It's bringing rain.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.981
We're supposed to get
5,000 a month.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.693
But with figure state and local taxes,
equipment fees,

12:58.903 --> 13:02.071
medical and maintenance costs,
administrative fees...

13:02.281 --> 13:04.616
Well, you see the results.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.202
Fortunately with you two here,

13:07.411 --> 13:11.372
Mr. Johnson will be
more than adequately provided for.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.416
Good luck.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.002
I'll find my own way out.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.174
I have to quit my job, Bobby.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.968
How am I going to make it on this?

13:24.178 --> 13:26.721
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

13:27.056 --> 13:29.557
It was your bright idea
to bring him here in the first place.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.685
Come on, Shelly,
I'm thinking, all right?

13:33.395 --> 13:35.897
You better think of something, Bobby.
For the both of us.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.866
Donna, we already have
Laura Palmer's diary.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.953
No, this is her secret diary.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.957
- She gave it to this Howard Smith?
- Harold.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.000
- Why?
- I don't know why.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.169
To hide it or something.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.215
Did he ever actually show you
the diary?

14:04.218 --> 14:05.760
No.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.763
But he read from it.
I saw her name on the inside cover.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.267
- Her handwriting.
- Are you and James up to something?

14:12.726 --> 14:14.394
He has been warned
not to get mixed up...

14:14.603 --> 14:16.521
James has nothing to do with this.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.941
Donna, it is a lot like
the boy who cried wolf.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.485
The last time you played this game,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.196
Dr. Jacoby ended up in a hospital bed.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.532
It's not a game.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.494
All right.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.205
I'll try to get someone out there
to take a look.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.708
But my hands are full.
I can't promise anything.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.128
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a Sheriff Harry S. Truman.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.463
- You found him.
- Sheriff, please.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.757
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sheriff Harry S. Truman.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.176
- That's me.
- Federal Bureau of Investigation

14:47.344 --> 14:49.178
Regional Bureau Chief, Gordon Cole.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.681
That's a real mouthful,
but I can't hear myself anyway.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.975
I'm Agent Cooper's supervisor.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.853
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Can I speak with you a moment?

14:57.062 --> 14:59.439
Sure. Donna.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.275
Wait here.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.404
And who did you say you were?

15:06.614 --> 15:09.324
- I'm Sheriff Truman.
- Great. Pay dirt.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.827
You have to speak up, sheriff,
hearing's gone. Long story.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.038
Got these things
cranked up to the max.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.583
Are you looking for Agent Cooper?

15:18.792 --> 15:22.128
When an agent goes down in the field,
I jump right up and pay a visit.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.755
Agent Cooper's not here right now.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.174
Albert Rosenfield will not be
coming back,

15:26.342 --> 15:28.843
but I've got his lab report right here.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.471
Item: a Vicuna coat.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.225
Albert found fibers in the hall outside
of Cooper's room from a Vicuna coat.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.020
Coat was Vicuna?

15:39.897 --> 15:42.273
Sounds real good, sheriff,
but I already ate.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.361
Also got a lab report from Albert
on the one-armer's syringe.

15:46.570 --> 15:51.115
Albert has never seen a drug like it.
A combo. Really weird stuff.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.659
What else does Albert say?

15:52.868 --> 15:54.661
Papers. Papers found near
the bloody towel

15:54.828 --> 15:56.829
down the train tracks
from the crime site.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.957
- From a diary.
- Please.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.085
There's the one-armer now.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.379
Since when is selling shoes
against the law?

16:04.588 --> 16:07.674
Mr. Gerard, we need to ask you
a few questions.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.426
- Huh?
- Why don't we move over to my office.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.266
- My office.
- Right.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.860
She looks like an angel.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.948
Audrey?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.616
Audrey?

16:34.368 --> 16:36.160
Your father is here.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.165
Thank God, Audrey.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.504
Thank God.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.883
I was so worried about you.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.219
Were you?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.430
I was worried sick.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.726
You know, it's times like these

16:59.935 --> 17:04.230
that make a man aware
of the value of life.

17:05.607 --> 17:09.777
Every raindrop, every sunset.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.614
I'm aware of a lot of new things too,
Daddy.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.074
Shh, shh, shh.

17:16.493 --> 17:22.290
Now, we will get you home,
safe, warm, in your own bed.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.296
What a terrible experience,
terrible people.

17:29.089 --> 17:33.134
- The things that you must have seen.
- I saw so much.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.807
We'll sort it out.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.601
Together.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.104
Yes, Daddy.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.648
You and I.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.237
That's my girl.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.082
My car is outside.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.210
I'll take her home now.

18:09.046 --> 18:12.465
- Daddy?
- Yes, darling.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.261
I would like Agent Cooper to take me
home if that's all right with you.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.641
Fine.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.103
Maybe...

18:25.854 --> 18:28.815
Maybe we could all go together.
Hmm.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.448
Hi, Ed. I'm home.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.827
Isn't this the swellest dress
you have ever seen?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.703
Do you know
they didn't look at me twice

18:42.871 --> 18:44.622
when I used the charge card?

18:44.832 --> 18:48.334
Say, Ed, when do my parents
get back from Europe, anyway?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.337
Well, uh, pretty soon.

18:51.547 --> 18:56.134
It's neat having the place
all to ourselves.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.885
Pretend it's ours.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.720
Like we were married or something.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.806
Well, we can do that. Nadine...

19:02.015 --> 19:04.809
And there's some other stuff
we can do too.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.394
Well, like what?

19:06.603 --> 19:09.480
You know, silly. Ha, ha.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.359
You know what I was thinking?

19:13.569 --> 19:16.904
Tonight maybe we could go park
by the lake,

19:17.072 --> 19:18.906
and neck.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.242
Wait a minute.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.036
We don't have to go anywhere.

19:24.246 --> 19:28.541
Why, we can just stay right here.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.184
You've kept yourself
in fine nick, Josie.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.853
Sapphire earrings,

19:49.021 --> 19:50.897
Parisian perfume,

19:51.106 --> 19:52.648
cashmere sweaters.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.150
Please go.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.071
One-way ticket.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.157
Seattle, Hong Kong.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.497
- I have one more day.
- Keep what you earn.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.375
See what you can fit
into your suitcases.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.586
We leave tonight.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.174
I haven't received
my insurance money.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.510
And Ben Horne hasn't paid me yet
either.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.388
I waited for this for five years.

20:24.681 --> 20:28.309
Mr. Eckhardt will make it more
than worth your while.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.231
You can't make me leave.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.365
Be adaptable.

20:42.574 --> 20:46.702
We had an arrangement.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.791
Sheriff Truman is important to you.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.293
You lied to him.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.963
You made him into a fool.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.175
But he is important to you
nonetheless.

21:03.178 --> 21:06.264
Leave with me tonight.
Or I'll kill him.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.808
He doesn't know anything.

21:10.185 --> 21:14.188
The plane leaves at midnight.
Be there.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.775
Or I'll come for you and your sheriff.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.487
That's the arrangement.

21:51.059 --> 21:54.061
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.733
I think I owe you an apology.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.402
Not really.

22:02.904 --> 22:07.074
Well, when we were together,
you know, just talking,

22:07.284 --> 22:10.953
I felt something. I just wasn't sure.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.372
You looked at me and you saw Laura.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.708
I guess I did.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.128
Wanna know something
kind of strange?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.130
What?

22:21.715 --> 22:23.132
I liked it.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.801
You did?

22:26.636 --> 22:28.471
When we were growing up,

22:28.638 --> 22:32.058
Laura and I were so close.
It was scary.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.768
I could feel her thoughts,

22:33.935 --> 22:36.395
like our brains were connected
or something.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.230
And when she died suddenly,

22:38.398 --> 22:40.441
I got the chance to be Laura.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.943
At least other people saw me that way.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.447
Like the way that you looked at me.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.242
I liked that too.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.373
But it was wrong.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.210
It wasn't one thing or the other.

23:00.796 --> 23:04.006
For a while,
I got to be somebody different.

23:06.134 --> 23:09.011
But now I'm just me again.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.848
James,

23:13.016 --> 23:16.310
you and Donna belong together.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.063
That's the best thing.

23:24.194 --> 23:28.322
- It's just hard sometimes, you know?
- How?

23:29.157 --> 23:30.699
If you really love someone,

23:30.867 --> 23:33.661
it's like this bright light
is shining on you all the time.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.622
You're right in it and it's great.

23:36.832 --> 23:41.335
But I just don't think you can be
that way all the time.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.672
Sure you can.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.299
Well, I want to.

23:49.761 --> 23:53.013
I want to try to make the way
my heart feels last forever.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.890
Pretty weird.

24:02.899 --> 24:05.776
I'm going home tomorrow, James.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.865
I came to Twin Peaks
for Laura's funeral.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.617
But now it's time to go.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.415
So is this goodbye?

24:23.795 --> 24:26.046
I guess it is.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.477
Bye, James.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.454
To the fire.

25:05.170 --> 25:11.217
Now, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this call?

25:12.177 --> 25:15.054
I've got the contract
with Pete's signature.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.348
And I want my money.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.141
Of course you do.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.770
All of it. Now.
Before you get this.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.606
Josie, Josie.

25:26.024 --> 25:29.318
Surely a mind
as quicksilver as your own

25:29.486 --> 25:32.279
can grasp the complicated position
that we're in.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.073
Fluidity is everything, you know.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.618
I can't summon up cash reserves
that I don't have.

25:37.827 --> 25:41.205
But I have already

25:41.373 --> 25:44.833
and I will be happy
to assure you again

25:45.001 --> 25:47.086
that as soon as
the contracted payments

25:47.254 --> 25:49.838
arrive from Iceland,

25:50.006 --> 25:53.968
your percentage will immediately be
passed on.

25:54.135 --> 25:57.972
I won't leave this office
without my money.

26:00.517 --> 26:05.187
Why do I sense that, um,
this isn't a negotiable position?

26:08.942 --> 26:11.652
You're under some kind of pressure,
aren't you?

26:12.195 --> 26:14.613
Do not play games with me.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.992
Games?

26:21.496 --> 26:23.497
Josie,

26:23.665 --> 26:28.210
this key, ahem, unlocks
my personal hotel safe.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.879
Now, in that safe,

26:31.089 --> 26:35.175
I have put together
a fascinating dossier on you, my dear,

26:35.385 --> 26:39.513
and your late husband...
Andrew's little boat that went boom.

26:39.723 --> 26:43.225
So you behave yourself, lady,

26:43.393 --> 26:50.107
or believe me when I say
that I will bury you.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.651
That's a shame.

26:52.861 --> 26:57.156
Because if anything unfortunate
were to happen to me,

26:57.365 --> 26:59.491
it would lead authorities

26:59.701 --> 27:04.038
to a certain safety deposit box
in a bank in another city,

27:04.247 --> 27:06.582
inside of which
there is enough evidence

27:06.750 --> 27:10.252
to lock you away for three lifetimes.

27:10.462 --> 27:14.340
They will bury us side by side.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.931
Stalemate.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.268
Your move.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.064
Cash.

27:34.903 --> 27:39.114
Happily, I can accommodate you.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.496
Sign of good faith.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.002
Tokyo bank.

27:54.339 --> 27:59.718
Five million dollars.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.020
We are finished.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.733
Josie.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.905
Well played.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.552
Leo.

28:43.263 --> 28:46.306
We sort of figured
with you getting out and all.

28:46.516 --> 28:50.185
Well, what the hell, we sort of wanted
to give you a little party.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.772
Our way of saying,
"Hey, Leo Johnson, welcome home."

28:53.982 --> 28:55.733
Welcome home, darling.

28:55.942 --> 28:59.611
Because you're a special guy, Leo.
And we just want you to know

28:59.821 --> 29:04.408
that we remember all the great stuff
you did for the ones you loved.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.994
Like Shelly here.

29:08.788 --> 29:11.915
Who could ask for a more caring
and thoughtful husband?

29:12.125 --> 29:16.336
Making her clean your dirty clothes.
Wash your dishes.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.506
Mop your floors.
You're a class act, man.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.842
- Top to bottom.
- Class act.

29:22.051 --> 29:25.137
And how about Leo Johnson,
wife abuser?

29:25.346 --> 29:27.556
There's a guy I wanna party with.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.683
Soap in a sock.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.686
Internal injuries
and barely leaves a bruise.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.981
And last, but I'm thinking,

29:36.191 --> 29:37.441
not least,

29:37.650 --> 29:39.860
we got Leo Johnson, murderer.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.404
Hanging your wife up
like a piece of meat.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.323
Leaving her to burn.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.158
Don't let anybody ever tell you

29:46.367 --> 29:48.744
you don't know how to treat
a woman, buddy.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.417
This is your life, Leo Johnson.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.962
You deserve it.

30:00.006 --> 30:04.009
Every damn minute.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.659
He moved.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.995
- This is too creepy. I don't like this.
- Okay. Okay, Shel...

30:32.205 --> 30:33.705
Okay, maybe you're right.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.625
I mean, I don't want to exploit him
or nothing.

30:36.835 --> 30:41.004
Sorry, Leo.
We sort of got carried away.

30:41.214 --> 30:46.468
No need to make your rehabilitation
any more difficult than it already is.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.972
Doc Hayward said
you needed familiar stimulus.

30:50.181 --> 30:53.517
So we just figured, what the hell...

30:53.685 --> 30:55.185
...kazoos.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.937
Honest, Leo.

30:57.105 --> 31:00.148
Shelly and me are going
to do everything we can

31:00.316 --> 31:01.984
to make you feel safe and happy.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.570
Hey, cake. You want some cake?

31:08.491 --> 31:12.536
Oh, look at that.

31:12.745 --> 31:14.872
Ice cream.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.707
Bobby.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.668
Hey, Leo. Oh, jeez.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.921
Oh. Uh...

31:23.089 --> 31:25.465
Man, you gotta be more careful.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.596
Good thing we didn't light the candles.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.735
Agent Dale Cooper.

31:44.944 --> 31:47.195
Gordon, I hope you haven't been
waiting too long.

31:47.405 --> 31:50.657
I didn't just get here. I've been waiting
the whole afternoon to see you.

31:50.825 --> 31:51.867
What can I do for you?

31:52.076 --> 31:54.786
No matter whatsoever.
No apology necessary.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.331
Gave me a chance to meet
the local law enforcement team.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.666
A great bunch.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.377
Cooper.

32:02.545 --> 32:07.466
You remind me today
of a small Mexican Chihuahua.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.178
Can I speak to you
a moment in private, Coop?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.763
Of course, Gordon.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.806
Harry, can we use your office?

32:14.974 --> 32:17.976
You might ask the sheriff
if we could use his office.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.354
Go right ahead.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.106
Follow me, Gordon.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.985
I believe in secrecy, Coop.

32:27.195 --> 32:31.114
I'll make this fast. I didn't want
to say anything in front of the men.

32:31.282 --> 32:35.953
It's Albert's opinion that you might be
getting in over your head.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.915
This worries me, Coop.
I feel a certain responsibility.

32:40.124 --> 32:43.251
- Albert is wrong, Gordon.
- You went into the chute in Pittsburgh.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.004
And I want to make doubly sure,
in fact triply sure,

32:46.214 --> 32:48.465
that it does not happen again. Copy?

32:48.675 --> 32:50.634
Pittsburgh was a completely
different story.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.971
I was wounded in Pittsburgh, Gordon,

32:54.138 --> 32:56.974
but beyond that,
the case bears no similarities.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.309
I must say you look all right.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.437
Trace of circles under the eyes,
catch up on your sleep.

33:02.647 --> 33:06.233
But restless nights and uneasy dreams
go with the territory.

33:06.734 --> 33:09.736
I am tired, Gordon.
There is much work to be done.

33:09.946 --> 33:13.156
But mind, body and spirit
are up to the task.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.159
Without a doubt, I'm A-okay.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.621
Proud of you, Coop.

33:19.831 --> 33:20.998
Now, Gordon.

33:21.207 --> 33:24.543
What the hell is this
about a Mexican Chihuahua?

33:24.752 --> 33:26.920
You've got a problem
of a different sort here.

33:27.130 --> 33:30.048
Two and two do not always equal four.

33:31.050 --> 33:34.302
You ought to know, we can hear
everything you're saying out in the hall.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.972
- Come on in.
- Why don't you invite the sheriff on in.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.684
An anonymous letter sent
to home base

33:40.852 --> 33:41.893
with your name on it.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.603
Looks kind of familiar, doesn't it?

33:50.695 --> 33:52.696
It's a chess deal.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.657
Looks like a chess deal.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.244
It's an opening move
from Windom Earle.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.788
Windom Earle.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.415
Bless your heart, Coop.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.460
We're gonna have to watch
your back from now on.

34:12.508 --> 34:15.218
With Jerry on the road, well...

34:17.430 --> 34:19.639
I need you back here.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.808
Let's just say

34:21.976 --> 34:25.562
that I have a much better sense
of what you've been through

34:25.730 --> 34:28.273
- in the last few weeks.
- I appreciate that, Ben.

34:28.441 --> 34:31.359
And I appreciate the confidence.
Really, I do.

34:31.569 --> 34:35.864
If it weren't for your indictment,
I could drop you into your old slot.

34:36.074 --> 34:40.994
You know, our friendship,
our history together.

34:41.204 --> 34:45.874
But first, I need to know
that you're okay.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.460
I'm 100 percent, Ben, 110 percent.

34:52.048 --> 34:54.049
Let me prove it to you.

34:54.717 --> 34:58.845
We've taken a payment
from the Icelanders on Ghostwood,

34:59.055 --> 35:04.267
but there's a group from the Orient
that wants in, in the worst way.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.104
Jerry is on his way to Tokyo
to check them out,

35:07.271 --> 35:09.773
and probably every geisha
within a hundred miles.

35:09.982 --> 35:13.610
I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner.

35:18.574 --> 35:22.327
We need to, uh,
buy a little time here.

35:22.912 --> 35:26.957
Well, the first thing we do
is, um, resurvey the land.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.834
Required because of the fire.

35:29.252 --> 35:32.337
Then we set up a whole parade
of inspectors, federal, county, state,

35:32.505 --> 35:34.381
until Jerry gets back with a full report.

35:34.924 --> 35:37.801
If there's any money,
we can run it thru the Caymans.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.678
Pick up some money
on the exchange rate.

35:39.887 --> 35:44.391
And if we have to, we can drop escrow
into a black hole for six months.

35:49.313 --> 35:53.150
- Ah?
- That's my Leland.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.753
Josie?

36:13.963 --> 36:17.883
Harry, I don't believe
you have met my assistant, Mr. Lee.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.343
Pleased to meet you.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.512
I'll take these to car.

36:26.809 --> 36:29.811
- What are you doing?
- I'm going away.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.522
Where? Why?

36:34.817 --> 36:36.693
Harry.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.321
Josie.

36:41.407 --> 36:44.868
I always called you from here.

36:45.953 --> 36:47.454
And then,

36:47.622 --> 36:50.248
it was here I could talk to you...

36:51.000 --> 36:54.169
...and be everything you wanted me
to be.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.880
Well, then stay here.

36:58.674 --> 37:04.679
I sold the mill. It's over.
I'm going home.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.681
No.

37:16.651 --> 37:19.110
I'm sorry, don't think badly of me.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.906
Mr. Lee, leave us alone.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.623
Josie, you can't leave.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.668
You saying this as the police?

37:36.462 --> 37:38.338
No.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.259
It's best if you forget about me.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.636
I love you.

37:54.563 --> 37:56.856
Josie, I love you.

38:13.791 --> 38:17.836
- Would you like a drink, Mr. Tojamura?
- No, thank you.

38:18.713 --> 38:22.674
You have my cashier's check
for 5 million.

38:23.217 --> 38:26.303
I have nothing.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.096
Why?

38:29.015 --> 38:30.807
Well, ahem...

38:33.394 --> 38:37.105
I know so little about you,
Mr. Tojamura.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.190
This is a small community.

38:39.775 --> 38:41.276
I'm being careful.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.863
Trying to be sensitive
to local concerns.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.574
You must understand the impact

38:47.742 --> 38:50.660
this project will have
on the community.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.748
You waste my time.

38:54.957 --> 38:56.666
We shall withdraw.

38:56.876 --> 39:00.920
Oh, no. Please, Mr. Tojamura.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.631
Consider the position that I'm in.

39:03.841 --> 39:07.719
The mill fire created
a raft of unforeseen problems,

39:07.887 --> 39:10.055
psychic as well as financial.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.767
I feel it's my duty as a civic leader

39:13.976 --> 39:16.895
to, uh, help foster
the healing process.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.816
Even at the, um, temporary expense

39:22.026 --> 39:24.027
of my larger business opportunities.

39:24.236 --> 39:26.154
I know a little about fire.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.656
My family was at Nagasaki.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.370
I'm sorry.

39:34.246 --> 39:36.331
Getting to know you

39:36.499 --> 39:40.752
Getting to know all about you

39:40.920 --> 39:42.670
Getting to like you

39:42.838 --> 39:44.798
Getting to hope you like me

39:47.259 --> 39:48.468
Getting to know you

39:48.636 --> 39:50.595
Would you excuse me a moment?

39:50.763 --> 39:53.056
but nicely

39:53.224 --> 39:59.229
You are precisely my cup of tea

39:59.397 --> 40:01.064
Where might you folks be from, sir?

40:01.232 --> 40:03.358
- Right here in Twin Peaks.
- That's terrific.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.402
How about those Steeplejacks, huh?

40:05.569 --> 40:07.695
Getting to know you

40:07.863 --> 40:11.699
Getting to feel free and easy

40:12.243 --> 40:14.119
When I am near you

40:14.286 --> 40:18.581
Getting to know what to say

40:18.749 --> 40:24.546
Haven't you noticed
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy?

40:24.713 --> 40:29.968
Because of all the beautiful
And new things

40:30.136 --> 40:32.011
I am learning about you

40:32.221 --> 40:39.310
Day by day

40:41.689 --> 40:44.023
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.693
Great Northern audiences
are the greatest in the world.

40:46.861 --> 40:47.902
Thank you. Good night.

40:48.070 --> 40:51.197
- Drive carefully.
- The King and I.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.616
Give it a rest, Leland.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.077
Temporary insanity, huh?

40:56.287 --> 40:58.830
Hopefully some of these people
will be on your jury.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.957
You will be home free.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.753
You like musicals?

41:08.799 --> 41:10.633
No.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.390
Not even Fiddler on the Roof?

41:17.808 --> 41:21.686
It made me weep like a little baby.

41:21.896 --> 41:27.192
I find the adherence to fantasy
troubling and unreasonable.

41:29.612 --> 41:32.030
Yeah.

41:37.661 --> 41:40.997
You're not from around here, are you?

41:43.375 --> 41:45.585
I am a visitor.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.964
Yeah. Well, uh,
could I buy you a sake?

41:50.883 --> 41:52.217
No, thank you.

41:56.889 --> 41:59.974
Or how about a nice cold milk?

42:06.774 --> 42:09.108
Please give me my medicine.

42:09.568 --> 42:12.987
- I can feel the change.
- What change?

42:13.197 --> 42:15.073
The drug found in his possession

42:15.282 --> 42:18.952
contains trace elements
usually found in Haloperidol.

42:19.161 --> 42:21.704
Do you suffer from schizophrenia?

42:21.914 --> 42:25.708
- Multiple personalities?
- It's too late.

42:26.877 --> 42:30.797
You know this man, don't you?
Why'd you lie when I questioned you?

42:31.423 --> 42:35.760
- It wasn't me. Don't you understand?
- Give him the drug, chief.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.346
- Not yet.
- If we give him the drug, Coop,

42:38.514 --> 42:41.140
you'll never see the other side.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.851
- Give him the medicine.
- No.

43:04.957 --> 43:10.545
There is no need for medicine.
I am not in pain.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.507
Who are you?

43:16.677 --> 43:19.887
- My name is Mike.
- What are you?

43:20.097 --> 43:23.933
I am an inhabiting spirit.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.812
Who is Phillip Gerard?

43:28.522 --> 43:31.274
He is host to me.

43:31.650 --> 43:33.943
You spoke to me in my dream

43:35.112 --> 43:37.697
about Bob.

43:38.407 --> 43:43.328
He was my familiar.

43:43.912 --> 43:45.622
Where does Bob come from?

43:46.040 --> 43:50.418
That cannot be revealed.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.798
What does Bob want?

43:57.384 --> 44:01.304
He is Bob, eager for fun.

44:01.513 --> 44:04.682
He wears a smile,

44:04.850 --> 44:07.769
everybody run.

44:10.856 --> 44:13.399
Do you understand the parasite?

44:13.734 --> 44:18.863
It attaches itself
to a life form and feeds.

44:20.908 --> 44:25.036
Bob requires a human host.

44:25.245 --> 44:28.289
He feeds on fear

44:28.457 --> 44:31.417
and the pleasures.

44:32.002 --> 44:35.630
They are his children.

44:39.301 --> 44:41.886
I am similar to Bob.

44:43.138 --> 44:45.098
We once were partners.

44:47.226 --> 44:51.145
- Through the darkness of future past
- Through the darkness of future past

44:51.355 --> 44:54.315
- The magician longs to see
- The magician longs to see

44:54.650 --> 45:00.488
One chance out between two worlds

45:00.698 --> 45:06.703
Fire walk with me

45:09.206 --> 45:15.545
But then I saw the face of God

45:15.754 --> 45:19.257
and was purified.

45:20.467 --> 45:22.844
I took off the arm.

45:23.053 --> 45:26.305
But remained close to this vessel.

45:26.515 --> 45:31.602
Inhabiting from time to time
for one single purpose.

45:32.521 --> 45:34.856
- To find Bob.
- To stop him.

45:35.733 --> 45:38.818
This is his true face.

45:40.779 --> 45:43.448
But few can see it.

45:44.324 --> 45:45.658
The gifted...

45:48.495 --> 45:51.873
...and the damned.

45:53.333 --> 45:55.501
Is Bob near us now?

45:57.212 --> 45:59.422
For nearly 40 years.

46:00.048 --> 46:01.132
Where?

46:04.636 --> 46:08.014
A large house made of wood.

46:08.223 --> 46:10.308
Surrounded by trees.

46:10.976 --> 46:16.063
The house is filled with many rooms,
each alike.

46:16.398 --> 46:20.485
But occupied by different souls.

46:20.694 --> 46:22.445
Night after night.

46:25.199 --> 47:24.549
The Great Northern Hotel.
