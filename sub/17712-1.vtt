02:28.376 --> 02:29.707
Good morning, Sister

03:35.176 --> 03:36.200
Good day, Maria

03:37.278 --> 03:38.870
You startled me, Marcello

03:39.114 --> 03:42.481
l wanted to show you this lamb.
lt was born last week

03:42.917 --> 03:44.384
The family grows...

03:44.686 --> 03:45.744
See how much it weighs

03:47.455 --> 03:51.221
At least two bags of rice
or two barrels of wheat

03:52.026 --> 03:54.893
Come and see me
if he has any problems

03:55.630 --> 03:56.995
Where's the rest of them?

03:57.799 --> 03:58.265
There

04:48.049 --> 04:48.674
Here...

04:51.886 --> 04:52.511
Go on...

04:53.822 --> 04:54.618
Take a bite

08:23.464 --> 08:26.126
Still not done?
What've you been up to?

08:26.334 --> 08:27.266
Lazy creature!

08:27.769 --> 08:30.897
l should have the pair of you
locked up for a week

08:32.472 --> 08:36.203
Dinner still not ready?
You worthless creature

08:37.412 --> 08:40.279
Look at this!
What a disgusting mess...!

08:40.481 --> 08:41.948
Only fit for animals!

10:26.921 --> 10:28.479
Dinner's late again

14:26.994 --> 14:28.018
What's wrong sister?

14:30.064 --> 14:32.259
- l want to die
- Why?

14:34.502 --> 14:36.402
l've always felt this way

14:38.406 --> 14:41.933
When you take religious orders
you must change the way you think

14:42.843 --> 14:44.242
You are a nun, Sister

14:47.014 --> 14:49.505
l came here to
hide from the world

14:50.017 --> 14:50.676
l don't understand

14:51.619 --> 14:54.452
My color, Sister.
That's my curse

14:55.289 --> 14:56.620
l just want to die

14:58.893 --> 14:59.416
No

15:00.861 --> 15:04.957
My parents were slaves.
l was born a slave

15:05.466 --> 15:08.299
l'm tired of being mistreated

15:10.671 --> 15:13.663
l came to the convent
to escape all that

15:14.241 --> 15:18.143
But nothing's changed.
l wish l'd never been born

15:18.612 --> 15:20.375
l wish l'd never been born

15:21.849 --> 15:23.817
Even here l'm treated badly

15:24.351 --> 15:27.184
Sister, death is no solution

15:28.222 --> 15:30.383
We don't own our lives

15:31.625 --> 15:34.185
They belong now
to our beloved Lord

16:19.673 --> 16:21.038
Good morning, Sister

18:52.693 --> 18:53.387
Come in

19:00.367 --> 19:03.029
- Hail Mary the Pure
- God be with you

19:03.437 --> 19:05.735
Sister, Sofia's cow is sick

19:06.073 --> 19:08.166
Mother Superior
wants you to help

19:08.475 --> 19:11.103
She says you know
about these things

19:31.031 --> 19:33.090
l think it's a lung infection

19:33.667 --> 19:34.793
She's very sick

19:35.502 --> 19:40.599
Caridad, bring me some pine needles,
some mint and grass

19:41.408 --> 19:43.672
And you, Sister,
start to make a fire

19:59.760 --> 20:00.590
Oil, Sister

20:21.448 --> 20:25.407
You can go now.
The worst is over

20:26.186 --> 20:29.781
l'll stay.
Go and get some sleep

24:02.669 --> 24:03.931
God be with you, Sister

24:05.005 --> 24:06.063
Can l help you?

24:08.642 --> 24:11.770
Sister Maria, l've come
to make a confession

24:13.146 --> 24:15.410
l put my life in your hands

24:16.783 --> 24:18.717
But why confide in me?

24:19.519 --> 24:21.384
You should see
the Mother Superior

24:23.123 --> 24:24.647
Please, Sister Maria...

24:25.559 --> 24:28.084
...only you can help me

24:29.196 --> 24:31.130
l trust only you

24:32.432 --> 24:34.627
Very well, tell me...

24:37.304 --> 24:42.867
Maria... Sister...
The truth is...

24:45.379 --> 24:46.368
...l love you

24:49.583 --> 24:50.880
l don't understand, Sister

24:53.086 --> 24:57.455
Observing your virtue,
your depth, your purity...

24:58.291 --> 25:00.020
l fell in love with you

25:00.360 --> 25:02.988
l love you Maria. Forgive me...

27:05.819 --> 27:07.218
My name is Luzbel, Sister...

27:09.556 --> 27:10.853
Call me Lucifer...

27:11.992 --> 27:12.890
Mephisto...

27:15.095 --> 27:16.153
lf you want me...

27:17.764 --> 27:19.026
lf you need me

27:21.535 --> 27:22.467
Just think of me

27:25.705 --> 27:27.434
l'm everywhere

27:30.210 --> 27:32.440
ln your mind for eternity

27:34.648 --> 27:36.616
All your life,
l am with you

30:56.016 --> 30:59.383
lt is impossible to describe
the face of a sinner

30:59.753 --> 31:06.215
ln fact, in a society of the damned
they all look the same

31:06.659 --> 31:12.097
ln general they are fearsome;
lifeless, like a corpse

31:12.532 --> 31:16.935
Some are black...
Some burn like a torch

31:17.270 --> 31:21.104
Some are found in food
or in sick bodies

31:21.307 --> 31:24.799
Many are cursed.
lnstead of a face, they have fur

31:25.011 --> 31:30.210
You can only see their teeth
and their monstrous bodies

33:51.324 --> 33:52.848
Good morning, Marcello

33:54.494 --> 33:55.518
Morning, Maria

34:55.788 --> 34:57.619
Do you know the story
of the King of the River?

34:59.592 --> 35:03.722
lt's just a fairy tale,
and you're too old for those now

35:04.731 --> 35:07.393
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, Sister! l swear

35:07.967 --> 35:11.403
lt's not a bad thing.
You'll soon be a man

35:12.405 --> 35:13.770
Maybe you already are

35:15.642 --> 35:19.840
Yes, you are a man...
l'm right, aren't l?

35:21.681 --> 35:24.707
Do you want to show me
how much?

38:06.579 --> 38:11.539
lt's me. Sister Clemencia.
Open up

38:19.225 --> 38:20.055
What is it?

38:24.564 --> 38:25.724
Can't you say?

38:46.752 --> 38:50.415
My shoulder...
lt really hurts

38:50.890 --> 38:52.585
l fear it might be serious

38:58.598 --> 39:02.295
- You must have sinned
- No, Sister. l never sin

39:02.502 --> 39:07.633
l have been here many years
and am free of sin

39:10.309 --> 39:14.109
Maybe...
But you have the Devil's mark

39:15.114 --> 39:17.639
Look!
l have one too...

39:19.785 --> 39:20.945
Don't lie to me

39:21.721 --> 39:25.384
Sister...
l know you have studied medicine

39:25.958 --> 39:27.585
l know you can cure me

39:46.946 --> 39:48.174
Does it still hurt?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.222
What took you so long?

41:10.363 --> 41:12.194
l was praying, Mother

41:13.265 --> 41:16.996
l saw Sister Clemencia running away
What happened?

41:17.370 --> 41:19.895
She wanted me to cure her.
But l couldn't

41:21.841 --> 41:24.105
She's really...very sick

41:24.710 --> 41:25.699
Do you know what it is?

41:29.849 --> 41:33.182
My daughter,
what troubles you?

41:33.386 --> 41:34.478
Nothing, Mother

41:35.087 --> 41:39.956
l can sense
that you have something to tell me

41:40.660 --> 41:41.592
But you're afraid

41:42.294 --> 41:47.698
Our community is based on
trust, forgiveness, help...

41:48.534 --> 41:50.161
Why not let me help you?

41:52.304 --> 41:58.300
Why won't you talk to me?
Have you had wicked thoughts?

41:59.345 --> 42:02.644
l was praying, Mother.
l'm alright

42:02.948 --> 42:05.075
l don't see the prayer book

42:05.317 --> 42:09.048
lt fell when l answered the door.
l think it's under the bed

42:11.490 --> 42:17.258
l'll pray for you, Mother...
And for Clemencia

42:22.001 --> 42:24.629
Sister Clemencia is very sick,
Mother

42:26.105 --> 42:26.833
...ln here

46:55.808 --> 47:00.575
Good evening, Mother.
lt's nice to see you

47:00.779 --> 47:03.145
But why are you wandering
here alone?

47:03.415 --> 47:06.942
l heard Marcello was ill.
l hope it's not serious

47:07.286 --> 47:08.583
l came to see him

47:09.154 --> 47:12.089
No, Mother. Marcello isn't ill

47:12.324 --> 47:16.556
He's just very tired and is sleeping

47:16.829 --> 47:20.424
But please come in.
Please give him your blessing

47:31.844 --> 47:33.311
ln there, Mother

55:51.009 --> 55:51.498
Come in

55:55.780 --> 55:57.042
Hail Mary the Pure

56:00.285 --> 56:01.274
What's wrong, Sister?

56:03.154 --> 56:06.590
We came to ask if you want
to go with us...

56:06.791 --> 56:10.693
..to the funeral
of Marcello and his grandmother

56:11.096 --> 56:13.530
No!
What happened?

56:14.232 --> 56:19.932
Afire...
They burned to death in their sleep

56:20.272 --> 56:22.763
The villagers brought the bodies here

56:26.177 --> 56:28.202
Where are the bodies?

56:28.813 --> 56:32.044
ln the chapel, waiting for burial

56:33.652 --> 56:38.180
May l...
l want to be alone with the bodies

56:38.890 --> 56:40.482
l wish to pray for them

56:41.660 --> 56:44.185
You know how much
l loved Marcello

56:52.737 --> 56:58.334
When the bells sound,
l shall return from my vigil

56:58.843 --> 57:00.003
Very well, Sister

59:34.799 --> 59:36.960
Your sins know no bounds!

59:37.368 --> 59:39.700
You have offended the Lord
with your actions

59:40.004 --> 59:44.031
l tried to help you
but you rejected me

59:45.243 --> 59:45.902
Do you hate me?

59:46.177 --> 59:50.170
The Holy lnquisition
will judge you

59:50.782 --> 59:53.046
The important thing
is to save your soul

59:54.719 --> 59:56.084
But l have done nothing

59:56.287 --> 59:57.652
You plead innocence?

59:57.856 --> 01:00:04.318
No, not innocence.
But the Devil is in me

01:00:05.997 --> 01:00:07.464
l don't fear Hell...

01:00:08.433 --> 01:00:10.094
...for l AM Hell!

01:00:10.635 --> 01:00:12.330
Pray that the Lord
did not hear you

01:00:12.837 --> 01:00:16.034
l shall ascend
to the highest point of heaven

01:00:16.574 --> 01:00:18.906
And build my throne
next to the stars

01:00:20.411 --> 01:00:22.106
l'm more powerful than God

01:00:22.847 --> 01:00:23.973
l'll not serve him

01:00:24.816 --> 01:00:26.283
But revolt against him!

01:00:26.684 --> 01:00:29.175
Silence!
You speak the words of Satan!

01:00:29.387 --> 01:00:31.184
l'll do as my master says

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:33.781
l'll gather together all those...

01:00:34.225 --> 01:00:36.455
...most pure in heart and soul...

01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:40.922
...have them follow after me,
then torture them all...

01:00:41.533 --> 01:00:44.229
...in the darkest realms of Hell!

01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:45.900
You are damned!

01:00:47.372 --> 01:00:49.670
Oh! Lord forgive me

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:47.320
l've always hated you

01:01:47.799 --> 01:01:51.291
Ever since you stole my place here

01:06:11.462 --> 01:06:12.588
ls everything ready?

01:06:13.064 --> 01:06:19.003
Yes, it's sad the Lord took
Marcello and his grandmother

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:20.594
He was so young

01:10:23.814 --> 01:10:28.114
Lord, if l worshipped you
because l feared Hell

01:10:28.486 --> 01:10:30.181
Then let me burn in Hell

01:10:31.188 --> 01:10:33.782
lf l loved you
only in promise of Heaven

01:10:33.991 --> 01:10:35.458
Then exclude me from it

01:10:36.127 --> 01:10:39.858
But if l loved you for yourself,
then am l your daughter

01:10:40.898 --> 01:10:42.490
Your daughter...

01:10:43.534 --> 01:10:46.662
Don't deny me your wonders

01:12:18.896 --> 01:12:22.730
Sister...
l've come to save you

01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:26.826
You will be the happiest
of all women

01:12:27.671 --> 01:12:32.802
Begone and leave me with my pain,
damn you!

01:12:33.711 --> 01:12:36.976
You turned me into a monster.
Begone!

01:12:37.948 --> 01:12:40.439
Accept me and you shall become
Mother Superior

01:12:41.151 --> 01:12:44.314
l wish to die in peace.
Begone, Lucifer!

01:12:45.789 --> 01:12:51.421
Look, Sister, the nuns are coming
to take you to the lnquisition

01:12:52.496 --> 01:12:54.191
They bring the fiery cross

01:12:54.965 --> 01:12:56.990
You know what that means

01:13:13.217 --> 01:13:16.880
Before killing you,
they will torture you

01:13:18.355 --> 01:13:20.380
Your mouth will be ripped open

01:13:21.091 --> 01:13:24.151
lt will be filled with molten lead

01:13:24.929 --> 01:13:27.523
Your body torn
into a thousand pieces

01:13:28.399 --> 01:13:31.129
Your screams will echo
through the valley

01:13:31.869 --> 01:13:33.734
They will all watch you die

01:13:34.838 --> 01:13:35.770
Think of that

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.532
Think!

01:13:38.676 --> 01:13:40.405
Do you wish to be Mother Superior?

01:13:41.178 --> 01:13:42.941
You will be happy and important

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.638
Silence, you have tempted me enough

01:13:47.184 --> 01:13:48.412
Begone, Satan!

01:13:48.986 --> 01:13:50.476
ln the name of Christ!

01:14:47.578 --> 01:14:52.880
Luzbel! Luzbel!
l accept your bargain

01:14:53.317 --> 01:14:54.511
l accept!

01:16:07.491 --> 01:16:12.929
Sister, we have chosen you
as our new Mother Superior

01:16:13.297 --> 01:16:16.460
Do you accept?
Your virtue honors our community

01:16:16.667 --> 01:16:17.964
Please accept

01:16:25.476 --> 01:16:28.445
With you, we will all go to glory

01:16:28.946 --> 01:16:32.905
Cease your penitence.
Guide us into the light

01:16:33.684 --> 01:16:36.118
Sister Maria, lead us to Christ

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.188
Sister Maria, lead us to Christ

01:16:48.766 --> 01:16:52.293
- Accept, Sister Maria
- Without you, we are lost

01:16:54.171 --> 01:16:55.433
You are our guide

01:16:56.073 --> 01:16:56.903
The purest

01:16:57.241 --> 01:16:58.139
The most good

01:16:58.475 --> 01:16:59.601
The most virtuous

01:17:02.613 --> 01:17:05.241
l had decided to die here, in torment

01:17:06.583 --> 01:17:10.485
But if the community wants me,
l accept

01:17:11.655 --> 01:17:15.785
Even though there are others
more deserving

01:20:53.543 --> 01:20:59.345
See, l kept my promise.
You're no longer just a nun

01:21:01.051 --> 01:21:03.986
Those in Hell do not see
their imperfections

01:21:05.088 --> 01:21:10.116
ln air, fire and water
their breath their own atmosphere...

01:21:10.327 --> 01:21:11.487
...to reach their goal

01:21:22.139 --> 01:21:27.099
Now you're Mother Superior
their spiritual guide

01:21:28.745 --> 01:21:29.507
Go on...

01:21:30.347 --> 01:21:33.180
Go and enjoy yourself

01:21:35.285 --> 01:21:36.183
But first...

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:42.956
Go to the balcony.
The town waits to greet its chosen one

01:21:50.801 --> 01:21:52.632
Bye, Mother Superior!

01:22:33.143 --> 01:22:37.079
<i>Hail! Hail!</i>
<i>Hail the Mother Superior</i>

01:22:37.481 --> 01:22:41.884
<i>Hail! Hail!</i>
<i>Hail the Mother Superior</i>

01:22:42.652 --> 01:22:45.917
<i>Hail! Hail!</i>
<i>Hail the Mother Superior</i>

01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:15.770
All Sister Maria's suffering
is over now

01:25:16.573 --> 01:25:18.598
She's gone to the glory of God

01:25:18.942 --> 01:25:22.469
So sad she was locked up like this

01:25:22.812 --> 01:25:25.007
We tried to protect her
from the plague

01:25:25.215 --> 01:25:27.149
Yet it still took her life

01:25:27.617 --> 01:25:31.383
Let's pray for the eternal rest
of her soul

01:25:47.203 --> 01:25:50.070
- Well?
- Yes, Mother Superior...

01:25:50.473 --> 01:25:52.839
...Sister Maria has gone to heaven

01:25:57.547 --> 01:26:02.951
After seven days of suffering
she finally gave up her spirit

01:26:03.286 --> 01:26:07.279
l'll arrange for a Mass,
and the funeral

01:26:08.305 --> 01:26:14.338
