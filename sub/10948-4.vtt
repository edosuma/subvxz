Why did you call me here
if you just wanted to kill us?

17:55.540 --> 17:57.120
Wait!

17:57.210 --> 17:59.250
I didn't call you here.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.920
We were flying over, and I heard
something calling to me,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.010
telling me to land.

18:05.170 --> 18:06.510
He's the Avatar.

18:06.590 --> 18:08.470
Stuff like that happens to us a lot.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.180
The Avatar?

18:10.260 --> 18:11.510
Come with me.

18:14.430 --> 18:16.310
KATARA: So who are you, then?

18:16.930 --> 18:19.940
I protect the swamp from
folks that want to hurt it,

18:20.020 --> 18:22.020
like this fellow with his big knife.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.360
See?

18:23.480 --> 18:25.360
Completely reasonable. Not a monster,

18:25.440 --> 18:27.280
just a regular guy defending his home.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.610
Nothing mystical about it.

18:30.570 --> 18:33.580
MAN: Oh, the swamp is a mystical place,
all right.

18:33.700 --> 18:34.830
It's sacred.

18:35.450 --> 18:39.580
I reached enlightenment right here,
under the banyan grove tree.

18:39.670 --> 18:42.750
I heard it calling me, just like you did.

18:43.630 --> 18:46.590
Sure you did. It seems real chatty.

18:47.970 --> 18:51.260
See, this whole swamp
is actually just one tree

18:51.390 --> 18:53.220
spread out over miles.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.350
Branches spread and sink and take root

18:56.430 --> 18:58.850
and then spread some more...

18:58.930 --> 19:01.560
One big, living organism,

19:01.650 --> 19:04.820
just like the entire world.

19:06.030 --> 19:10.200
I get how the tree is one big thing,
but the whole world?

19:10.280 --> 19:11.280
Sure.

19:11.490 --> 19:13.160
You think you're any different

19:13.240 --> 19:16.080
from me or your friends or this tree?

19:16.490 --> 19:18.330
If you listen hard enough,

19:18.410 --> 19:21.830
you can hear every living thing
breathing together.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.920
You can feel everything growing.

19:25.540 --> 19:29.340
We are all living together,
even if most folks don't act like it.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.010
We all have the same roots,

19:32.130 --> 19:35.600
and we are all branches of the same tree.

19:35.850 --> 19:37.720
KATARA: But what did our visions mean?

19:37.810 --> 19:41.440
In the swamp, we see visions
of people we've lost,

19:41.640 --> 19:45.360
people we loved, folks we think are gone.

19:45.480 --> 19:50.320
But the swamp tells us they're not.
We're still connected to 'em.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.240
Time is an illusion, and so is death.

19:54.530 --> 19:56.330
But what about my vision?

19:56.410 --> 19:57.910
It was someone I had never met.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.540
You're the Avatar. You tell me.

20:01.410 --> 20:04.040
Time is an illusion...

20:04.830 --> 20:08.130
So, it's someone I will meet.

20:09.760 --> 20:13.260
Sorry to interrupt the lesson,
but we still need to find Appa and Momo.

20:13.550 --> 20:15.590
I think I know how to find them.

20:15.970 --> 20:18.430
Everything is connected.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.910

so interested in eating Appa?

The South Pole.

Didn't know there was
waterbenders anywhere but here.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.200
They got a nice swamp there, do they?

22:02.280 --> 22:04.790
No, it's all ice and snow.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.660
Hmm, no wonder you left.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.290
Well, I hope you realize now

22:09.370 --> 22:11.920
that nothing strange was going on here.

Just a bunch of greasy people
living in a swamp.

I told you, we were hungry.

I'm eating a giant bug.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.970
Mmm-ugh.

22:24.060 --> 22:27.100
But what about when the tree showed me
where Appa and Momo were?

22:27.310 --> 22:29.270
That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count.

The only thing I can't figure out

is how you made the tornado
that sucked us down.

I can't do anything like that.

22:35.900 --> 22:38.450
I just bend the water in the plants.

Well, no accounting for weather.
