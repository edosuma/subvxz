to stand a weekend
at my grandparents'.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.480
I mean, they're
just too jolly

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480

01:16.480 --> 01:17.960
Robyn, there's something

definitely wrong
with you.

01:23.680 --> 01:24.960
Nothing,

01:24.960 --> 01:27.000
So, let's go to
the mall together.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.200
We can do, uh, last
minute shopping.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.320
I can't.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.760
I don't have
any money.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.080
I started saving,

01:38.520 --> 01:40.600
I can't believe
this, Alex.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.520
You go through this every year.

01:42.520 --> 01:43.480
I know.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.400
What are you so
worried about?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.760
Christmas isn't just
about giving gifts.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.760
Nicole's right.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.160
I mean, it's also about

01:50.160 --> 01:51.920
a decadent merchandising plot

01:51.920 --> 01:54.720
that stabilizes
a government-controlled economy

01:54.720 --> 01:56.240
in the name of goodwill.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.760
Doesn't matter
what you say.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.840
If I don't have presents
by Christmas

01:59.840 --> 02:01.760
I'll be considered
a total failure

02:01.760 --> 02:03.160
as a sister
and daughter.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.920
Maybe I can get
a job with you.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.120
I don't know, Alex.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.720
The area of forestry
I've been involved with

02:08.720 --> 02:10.560
demands a certain skill base.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.880
Don't be so dramatic.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.120
You're just selling

02:16.120 --> 02:17.240
All right,
all right.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.560
I'll inquire
as to positions available.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.520
Thank you.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.160
All right,

02:29.880 --> 02:31.760
I'm really excited
about this.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.280
It's been over ten years

02:33.280 --> 02:35.120
since the whole
Mack family

02:35.120 --> 02:36.920
has been back
to Paradise Valley.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.720
Remember
the last one?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.560
I was a junior
research member

02:40.560 --> 02:42.560
you were working
as a secretary.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.280
We didn't have much
to show for ourselves--

02:45.280 --> 02:46.680
except for the girls.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.560
We could barely
afford a tree.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.320
It was pretty
humiliating.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.080
George...

02:52.080 --> 02:54.880
Uncle Bernard...
I don't have any ideas.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.800
What do you think
he would like?

02:56.800 --> 02:59.360
Bernard-- do we have
to get him something?

02:59.360 --> 03:01.960
Yes, George, I can't
believe you said that.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.560
That's no holiday spirit!

03:03.560 --> 03:05.960
Because that Bernard
won't ever let up.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.560
Every time we see him,
he's calling me

03:08.560 --> 03:10.320
"Supernerd" and "Mr. Wizard"

03:10.320 --> 03:11.840
and when he was here last

03:11.840 --> 03:13.920
he really rubbed it in
by bragging

03:13.920 --> 03:16.080
about his money
and his success--

03:16.080 --> 03:18.720
and by making fun
of our situation.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.760
I've never forgotten that.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.920
George, he's my brother.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.120
I love him.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.680
We all know he has
a lousy sense of humor.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.160
I think you're taking this
too personally.

03:29.160 --> 03:33.080
I'll show him
a Mack family Christmas.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.960

03:49.960 --> 03:52.520
that is the correct
approach, Miss Atron?

03:52.520 --> 03:53.720
Perhaps you shouldn't

03:53.720 --> 03:55.440
get that close
to the project.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.000
Yes. Yes, I do, or I
wouldn't have said so.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.720

03:59.720 --> 04:02.320

you ask to borrow
more money. No!

it's Christmas.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.400
Can't you be
more generous?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.320
Alex, Christmas
is the one time

04:32.320 --> 04:33.760
I can't afford
to be generous.

04:33.760 --> 04:34.960
I have to buy
gifts, too.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.040
Mr. Mack:
Alex, give me a hand.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.040
I'll plug this one in,
then you put that one in.

you start your job tomorrow.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.160
You're the best.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.880
So how much does it pay?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.760
Up to you--
it's all commission.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.640
You get paid for the amount
of trees you sell.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.160
Don't worry,
I'll show you.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.400
Well, we need

07:17.400 --> 07:20.080
a little information
first

07:20.080 --> 07:21.800
like, what's the difference

between a Douglas fir
and a cypress?

07:24.200 --> 07:27.240
Um, I-I'm not exactly sure.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.400
Well, I think
cypresses are conical

07:29.400 --> 07:32.680
when young, then grow into
sturdy, low-spreading trees.

answer my questions

No. But as you know,
I'm often

08:34.520 --> 08:36.679
in the right place
at the wrong time.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.360
Dave, I'm about
to enter into

08:38.360 --> 08:40.520
a very important test
with Miss Atron.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.880
Did you have
something urgent

08:42.880 --> 08:45.760
that you needed
to discuss with me?

08:45.760 --> 08:47.240

10:05.040 --> 10:07.960
No, uh, no positive

10:07.960 --> 10:09.520
Might be a system malfunction.

Vince, I'm fed up
with system malfunctions.

Would you get it
under control

practically every tree
on the lot.

11:32.960 --> 11:37.080
Yeah, Annie, the concept we're
dealing with here is commission.

You move the merchandise,
you make the money.

You're killing us.

I'm never going to make
enough money at this rate.

I might help her

Alex, I got to go
and you should, too.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.920
That monkey's exhibiting
all of your symptoms.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.760
If he's been contaminated
like I think he has

13:04.760 --> 13:06.560
then Vince isn't far behind.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.160
We can't leave him here.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.480
They'll chop him up

like they want
to do with me.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.280
Alex, it's not worth it.

Now, just sell me a tree
and forget about the monkey.

You've given me
a lot already.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.760
all the stores
are already closed.

all our fuses.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.640
I'll have to work on it
all day tomorrow

16:52.640 --> 16:54.520
and it still might not be ready.

the last laugh... again.

Have you taken a good look
at this house lately?

I can't possibly
get it cleaned up by tomorrow.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.680
Mom, I wanted to wear this
for the party tomorrow

17:07.680 --> 17:09.520
and it has a big rip.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.640
Can you fix it?

17:10.640 --> 17:12.960
No, Annie,
I, I don't have the time.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.079
You'll have to sew it yourself.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.880
Mom, you know I can't sew.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.240
You can split atoms,
but you can't sew?

17:19.240 --> 17:20.599
Fine, forget it.

something I hate instead.

all of this?

18:51.080 --> 18:52.680
Well, Ray helped a little.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.320

happened by accident.

that chimp got away?

I hope so.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.840
Once they discover
he has powers like you

as an even bigger threat
than ever.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.320
So it's good

As long as you made it, yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.200
But, whatever
made you do it, Alex?

19:52.200 --> 19:55.840
Because he was just like me.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.120
I guess.

Wherever he is

19:58.320 --> 20:00.680
I hope he has friends

20:45.920 --> 20:48.000
at Paradise Valley Chemical

20:48.000 --> 20:50.720
who believe in progress
at any cost.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.640
<i>( Car door slams )</i>

20:52.640 --> 20:54.760
Oh, no.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.560
<i>( Doorbell rings )</i>

21:02.560 --> 21:05.720
Bernard,
long time no see.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.440
Hiya, George.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.200
Do you, uh, mind
if we have a word outside?

21:10.200 --> 21:13.680
George, uh, I was thinking
on my way over here tonight

21:13.680 --> 21:17.000
how I've made jokes at your
expense over the years.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.560
Jokes? I really can't
recall that, Bernie.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.000
You know, how I used to tease
you about being Mr. Wizard

21:23.000 --> 21:24.840
or how one day you'd discover

21:24.840 --> 21:27.880
how to turn those little
paychecks into big ones?

21:27.880 --> 21:29.960
Oh, now it's
coming back to me.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.440
Well, before I enter
your beautiful home

21:32.440 --> 21:34.040
and see your family again

21:34.040 --> 21:36.760
I wanted to let you know
that I am sorry...

21:36.760 --> 21:38.240
And that I am very proud

21:38.240 --> 21:40.920
that my sister has married
such a good guy.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.840
Merry Christmas, George.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.800
Merry Christmas, Bernard.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.440
Merry Christmas.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.120
Look, you want to help me
hang some lights?

21:49.120 --> 21:52.320
Oh, yeah, but it's not
one of those contraptions...

21:52.320 --> 21:55.560
No, no...
Honey, honey, look who's here.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.640
Annie:
Hey, Alex

21:57.640 --> 22:00.200
what is it you want
for Christmas?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.400

22:10.360 --> 22:11.600
Ray:
That's cool.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.080
Merry Christmas, Al.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.400
Come on, you guys,
let's go eat.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.400
Merry Christmas, Ray.
