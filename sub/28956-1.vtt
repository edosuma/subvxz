WEBVTT

00:01.212 --> 00:03.535
I want to destroy Lydia Quigley.

00:03.560 --> 00:04.599
So do I.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.079
Then we'll be allies.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.479
I'm trying
to act against Quigley

00:07.480 --> 00:08.959
yet find myself doing her bidding.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.919
I hate you.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.759
My secret is a child.

00:13.760 --> 00:14.799
My brother.

00:15.801 --> 00:16.859
She is his.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.055
Your uncle is a monstrous incubus.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.193
It is him I protect you from.

00:21.218 --> 00:23.839
Miss Wells, may I tempt
you out for a drive?

00:23.840 --> 00:25.799
Lord Fallon's made me another offer.

00:25.800 --> 00:26.999
He's sending for me tonight.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.319
You've killed.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.090
Be silent or your
lovely daughter hangs.

00:33.091 --> 00:35.519
I'll confess to the murder
of Sir George Howard.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.919
- Take care of things for me.
- Well yes.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.399
The Lord Justice was
going to spare your mother,

00:41.400 --> 00:44.599
but I implored him not to.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.319
Get her down, man!

00:47.320 --> 00:49.079
Tomorrow you set sail for America.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.319
No, there is no hope
for me without my family!

00:51.320 --> 00:52.679
Tell us what you know

00:52.680 --> 00:54.839
or I'll release this avenging angel.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.239
What to blame? Is it your king?

00:57.240 --> 01:00.439
It's Blayne! Blayne.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.039
I do freely confess.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.799
I see no other path
but to take my own life.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
She's alive.

01:05.801 --> 01:07.039
No one can know.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.999
She can never come back, can she?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.559
It was your mother who assured
that mine kissed the rope.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.119
Charles!

01:13.120 --> 01:15.959
I can't hang her, no
matter what she's done.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.599
- You must come with us.
- Where?

01:17.600 --> 01:18.959
It's her judgment day.

01:54.493 --> 01:57.493
_

02:01.480 --> 02:04.159
We're most grateful for
your interest in Catherine.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.839
She's a headstrong girl,
but with firm instruction,

02:06.840 --> 02:10.318
she'll transform into a
biddable and doting wife.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.559
I look forward
to having her as my own.

02:14.120 --> 02:17.239
She's in the stables. Horse-mad.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.439
But I'm sure you'll soon tame that.

02:31.520 --> 02:36.319
Bless God, for this is paradise.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.079
There was no other path for me.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.879
If your position was ordained by birth,

02:46.880 --> 02:50.319
then so was mine.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.319
Our men do well at keeping
wives and courtesans apart.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.279
I thought some discourse
between us might be of use.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.719
I simply want to know if
she's ruining my husband.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.919
I'm a bawd now.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.279
I run a house. There's
hardly a man in my bed.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.879
So you live off the flesh of others.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.359
Girls come to me from the street.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.199
I offer them income and safety.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.879
They've been ruined by poverty,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.759
not by Miss Wells.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.559
And there's more that
we can do for them.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.120
You'd have us offer charity to whores?

03:25.334 --> 03:27.654
I knew your minds would be small.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.119
We'll break through their prejudice.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.359
I know it.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.920
Their prejudice will break you.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.879
Oh, Lucy Wells on arrival
with another man from London.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.079
She's mine, sir. Mine.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.599
No, she's mine.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.279
Don't make me laugh, Hans, no.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.719
She's abs... I shall be
taking her home tonight.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.319
I've lavished her with
gifts the entire month.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.039
Right, you must win
me in a chariot race.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.519
Madam, perhaps
a ride in my chariot?

04:07.520 --> 04:08.999
This way.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.279
You men, take my hat
and be away with you.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.479
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets!

04:15.480 --> 04:17.798
Come on, you lot! Put your
coin where your mouth is!

04:17.800 --> 04:19.519
There's a lady to be won!

04:19.519 --> 04:21.678
Well, she makes them roar.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.239
Come on!

04:26.240 --> 04:29.119
Right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

04:34.000 --> 04:35.032
So this is London.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.439
Come on, you lot!

04:39.440 --> 04:41.639
We'll find gold in the muck,

04:41.640 --> 04:43.559
even if we have to sup with witches.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.999
You don't look like gentry.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.079
Oh, this has all the class we need.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.919
We're six up from Bishopsgate.
Our trade's insurance.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.350
Don't be fooled
by my dainty size.

05:01.351 --> 05:04.679
Any trouble, I'll flay your face off.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.879
Mr. Chadwick,
what big guns you've got.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.679
I only have to see a
man's pistol and I swoon.

05:23.680 --> 05:27.799
The shot is loaded and I'm taking aim.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.160
Light the flintlock, Mr. Chadwick.

05:29.161 --> 05:31.032
Oh, yes. Yes.

05:31.033 --> 05:32.471
- Fire away.
- Oh!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.159
I declare it a draw.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.559
A new challenge must decide it.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.159
Whoever licks that bald man's head first

05:47.160 --> 05:48.319
gets me.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.239
They've not spent enough. Not yet.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.279
Lick his head! Lick his head!

05:58.280 --> 06:00.479
You'll have to tup
one of them in the end.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.159
Tup yourself.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.919
I do.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.639
I've given you my
whole month's allowance

06:15.640 --> 06:17.439
and I insist.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.559
Well, you'll have to catch me first.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.439
Hey, Charlotte, put him right.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.839
He's a right cheeky dog, that one.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.512
Is this the legend, Charlotte Wells?

06:53.640 --> 06:56.039
I'm going to buy whatever she sells.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.359
Don't tell me. You're a poet.

06:58.360 --> 07:03.079
You'll find that I'm cut
with a fine, manly figure.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.479
Your mouth or your
manhood, which one's bigger?

07:07.400 --> 07:11.839
There's no pretense with me.
You get exactly what you see.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.719
A beauty is Fanny, with rhyming uncanny.

07:14.720 --> 07:18.079
What word do you use for
your moist nook and cranny?

07:18.080 --> 07:19.919
I call it my cunt, actually.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.841
Poetry was made for rogues and harlots.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.439
I'm no rogue.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.439
Mmm, you disappoint me.

07:29.440 --> 07:33.560
Tavern boy, soldier, citizen, trader.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.759
I earn money with my artful tongue.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.960
We're the same in that.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.479
Of all the light girls and Jezebels,

07:45.480 --> 07:49.079
none holds a torch to Charlotte Wells.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.239
Nerve endings.

07:57.240 --> 08:00.839
This is where mental
disorders originate.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.319
And stimulating these nerves

08:03.320 --> 08:07.239
can improve the
condition of the lunatic.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.359
There is no more effective
stimulation of the nerves

08:11.360 --> 08:13.959
than bodily evacuation.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.879
The more violent, the better.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.159
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:18.160 --> 08:20.279
I give you the rotational chair.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.279
No, please, please. No, no, no.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.479
No, please!

08:25.480 --> 08:27.239
I beg you, please!

08:27.240 --> 08:29.839
She will be spun for two hours or more.

08:29.840 --> 08:34.239
Her dizziness will provoke
involuntary evacuation

08:34.240 --> 08:36.599
through every orifice,

08:36.600 --> 08:39.599
thus enlivening her defective nerves.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.319
Charles! No!

08:45.320 --> 08:48.159
Charles!

08:48.160 --> 08:51.840
So like Boadicea or Lady Godiva?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.879
Shut up and use your mouth better.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.639
Oh!

09:38.760 --> 09:41.279
Please, fetch...

09:41.280 --> 09:43.999
fetch me a bucket, please.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.079
Please! Please!

09:56.440 --> 09:57.781
Gin.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.519
You've mistaken me for your flunkie.

10:00.520 --> 10:01.799
This is a pincher tavern now.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.559
Only our girls tout here.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.079
I'm not touting. I'm drinking.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.291
Gin.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.559
Chadwick. Gunmaker.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.959
Breath like burning
rags, but he tips in gold.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.279
Keep it.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.079
Your riches are mine in other ways.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.484
Lucy? Wha...

10:19.160 --> 10:20.879
Are you fallen off your chandelier?

10:20.880 --> 10:24.159
I'm hiding from a cull.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.759
- Then hide somewhere else.
- Don't you know who this is?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.279
Lucy Wells.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.439
Moves through London like a comet,

10:32.440 --> 10:34.119
leaving dead gentry in her wake.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.144
Lucy Wells?

10:37.640 --> 10:39.080
Welcome to the Saracen's.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.230
I heard you were in
posh rooms up on Swallow Street

10:45.231 --> 10:48.539
with a maid to sew
pearls in your muff-hair.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.719
And what are you? Tavern whore?

10:52.720 --> 10:57.039
No, I run all these
girls for Hal Pincher.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.359
And I'm riding him for
England and St. George.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.799
Lucy!

11:03.800 --> 11:06.719
Lucy Wells!

11:06.720 --> 11:08.759
- Where are you?
- My cull.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.559
Some nights I just can't be fadged.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.599
Well, then those muff
pearls will all turn to sand.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.799
I'm gonna go wash a
gunmaker out me garden.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.879
You win.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.679
Do you know how long it's been

11:22.680 --> 11:24.720
since I last rode a pole?

11:26.120 --> 11:27.599
Since I became a bawd.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.360
What made you break your fast?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.691
Some sport for my restless soul.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.799
I don't think
I've given you my name.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.103
Isaac Pincher.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.639
Me and my brother have taken
the lease on the Saracen's Head

11:41.640 --> 11:42.903
in Villiers Street.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.879
There's a place for you in our empire.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.879
What do you mean?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.879
This is my list.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.675
To rival the Harris's.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.159
I'll give you and your
girls matchless write-ups

11:53.160 --> 11:55.479
and promote your house
till it's first in Soho.

11:56.724 --> 11:59.111
For my services
in expanding your trade,

11:59.136 --> 12:00.831
I'll take nothing but a small levy.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.720
One quarter of what you make.

12:05.320 --> 12:09.039
So not a poet, but a
sly, backstreet pimp.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.479
There's a bond between us.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
You can feel it.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.599
We're both from the streets.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.119
I'm the world's fool.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.039
How dare you toy with me?

12:18.040 --> 12:20.479
Come to terms amicably,
for every girl you've got

12:20.480 --> 12:21.879
is in the arms of one of my men.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.117
Do you threaten us with violence?

12:25.960 --> 12:27.639
Don't let it come to that.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.199
These men are not what they say!

12:30.200 --> 12:31.959
They are filthy, pimping scum!

12:31.960 --> 12:34.279
- Hey, hey!
- Get your hands off me!

12:34.280 --> 12:36.119
Get your hands off me!

12:36.120 --> 12:38.039
You need to accept my offer.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.679
Go peck yourself, you little cock!

12:39.680 --> 12:42.719
I don't want to do
this. I hate to do this.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.159
Be my prize.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.439
I accept.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.319
A most excellent decision.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.359
You two, stay on the door.
Take the money.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.039
Give the girls their portion.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.319
The role I was assigned
at birth was poverty.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.959
Hell on Earth, as you know.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.319
Debt collectors.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.199
Open up!

13:34.200 --> 13:36.079
If you don't let them
in they'll break down the door.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.719
- I can't face them.
- Open this door!

13:38.720 --> 13:39.919
You must run.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.319
Where to?

13:42.320 --> 13:44.640
I said open this door!

13:47.600 --> 13:48.999
I've lost it.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.799
I've lost Golden Square.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.920
You'll find
a way to win it back.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.631
Stop staring at me

14:01.632 --> 14:04.359
with those stupid, hopeful eyes.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.899
You're like a fish dying in a puddle.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.239
Save yourself.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.999
Open up!

14:17.400 --> 14:19.039
Oy!

14:19.040 --> 14:20.599
Get out of the way!

14:20.600 --> 14:22.639
After him!

14:22.640 --> 14:28.079
"Nor that I am more
better than Prospero..."

14:30.400 --> 14:33.879
"Master of a full poor cell..."

14:36.080 --> 14:38.679
"And thy no greater father..."

14:41.320 --> 14:44.199
I've committed no crime!

14:44.200 --> 14:47.079
No!

14:47.080 --> 14:49.519
In the name of mercy, I beg you!

14:52.720 --> 14:55.519
A common groom.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.879
Gave her obscene pleasure.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.618
A surfeit of venereal nerves

14:59.619 --> 15:03.119
can give the female
odd and unbridled lusts.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.559
She's in the right hands.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.618
Please not this place!

15:05.619 --> 15:07.039
This place is hell!

15:07.040 --> 15:09.439
Then pray to God for forgiveness.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.599
Vile hypocrite!

15:12.600 --> 15:13.634
My father will raise up

15:13.635 --> 15:15.115
from his grave for what you do to me!

15:16.320 --> 15:18.039
I hope you
die in a spasm of anguish!

15:18.040 --> 15:19.283
Shush, shush!

15:19.284 --> 15:21.459
Your pain will be interpreted as mad.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.199
Get back, horrid creature!

15:34.120 --> 15:36.159
Why could I not come down tonight?

15:36.960 --> 15:40.319
My friends would have found
me lacking as your guardian.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.199
What was your salon about?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.520
It was a failed experiment.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.200
Few in our circle see the world as I do.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.699
She paraded her courtesan
in front of her friends.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.439
Daring or reckless?

16:01.440 --> 16:03.199
Unconventional.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.159
And yet she hides me away
and treats me like a child.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.239
Would you be daring too?

16:16.917 --> 16:19.356
William North will kill me
for letting in those fiends.

16:19.381 --> 16:20.540
He's not here.

16:20.565 --> 16:23.375
He's in York or Scarborough
or some other freezing place

16:23.400 --> 16:24.719
plying his fists.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.039
He'd have clobbered them whole.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.519
It's not your fault, Nance.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.399
That rank, lying
fuckster was so plausible,

16:29.400 --> 16:30.719
I took him to my bed.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.159
He's putting us in his list.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.439
If we cross him, he
can write what he likes.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.919
Call us all vile bitches
and pox-ridden sluts.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.759
- Then we fight clever.
- Ah.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.919
But the day that rhyming
prick takes over my house,

16:40.920 --> 16:42.679
you can step on my festering corpse.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.039
They fall before us like dominoes.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.319
Crossed the abyss of St. Martin's Lane

16:51.320 --> 16:54.519
into the kingdom of Soho,
conquering as we went.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.959
What have you done, brother?

16:56.960 --> 16:59.439
I drank a chalice of the purest nectar.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.439
I had Charlotte Wells
and then I wrecked her.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.059
I never lend money to strangers.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.759
We have a gentleman in common.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.999
Mr. Digby Reed.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.559
He told me you were a
legend among London bawds.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.759
You might know of me as Bet Harper.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.919
You ran the best molly-house in Bristol.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.319
And plan to surpass it here.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.359
It's Elizabeth Harvey now.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.399
I heard your house fell and folded,

17:34.400 --> 17:36.879
leaving nothing but a breeze.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.439
We failed before because
we were too visible.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.239
This time we'll hide
behind a modest veil.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.279
Gentlemen's clothing.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.799
My son has talents with
his needle and thread.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.479
Oh, you'll dress men in one room,

17:51.480 --> 17:55.199
undress them in another?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.439
I'll keep my boys in safety

17:58.640 --> 18:00.319
and make us both a pile.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.480
I have 200 in capital.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.679
There's a premises on the market.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.319
I've been watching its decline.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.719
It was a goldmine for a relative of mine

18:14.720 --> 18:16.319
and I covet it.

18:17.320 --> 18:20.240
Not a loan. A share of the deeds.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.519
Where is it?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.520
Hmm.

18:31.080 --> 18:36.720
"Azured vault, Set roaring war..."

18:41.320 --> 18:44.160
"Jove's stout oak..."

18:45.120 --> 18:46.959
"Graves at my command."

18:46.960 --> 18:49.560
Oh, God, please don't let me forget.

18:51.280 --> 18:55.080
"Graves at my command
have waked their sleepers."

18:59.920 --> 19:01.119
You're Prospero.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.120
Why has your family forsaken you?

19:15.960 --> 19:18.039
My father's dead.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.039
The man you saw,

19:20.040 --> 19:22.119
he wed my mother.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.800
And she's never smiled since.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.960
What was your crime?

19:30.160 --> 19:32.759
I found a heaven in the hay

19:32.760 --> 19:34.920
with a boy I'd known since childhood.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.640
I am fallen.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.680
No, angel.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.080
You are bright still.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.159
Isaac was always on show.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.519
Pa used to send him out front

20:00.520 --> 20:02.839
to charm coins out of the drinkers.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.160
He kept me in the back counting them up.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.799
He's roaring into Soho too fast.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.400
He doesn't think.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.719
What can I do?

20:14.720 --> 20:16.200
It's his vigor.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.639
He was the same in the fusiliers.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.759
Always restless for action.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.819
But it's you that holds this together.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.160
Don't let your brother blow it apart.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.639
Isabella, this is most awkward.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.239
When my husband
discovered you were coming,

20:55.240 --> 20:59.399
he asked me to retract the invitation.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.239
Because of the guest
I invited to my salon?

21:02.240 --> 21:04.119
Not only that.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.459
You must be aware.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.959
Have you not read the papers?

21:08.960 --> 21:11.739
They say your ward is your own child.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.399
Born after a liaison with a servant

21:15.400 --> 21:17.159
that your brother had to quash.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.959
It's a lie.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.319
Who's written such slander?

21:24.320 --> 21:26.159
Lady Isabella,

21:26.160 --> 21:28.679
I'd never ask you to leave,

21:28.680 --> 21:31.119
but I'm sure you'll understand.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.639
I have my wife's moral
welfare to think about.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.079
Sophia, let us go.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.879
This is your asp.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.679
Why are we doing this?

21:54.680 --> 21:56.159
They'll just be looking
at our dumplings.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.279
Well, they're sophisticated men.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.039
We have to entertain them.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.679
I knew a girl who could fire
peanuts out of her pipkin.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.159
That was entertaining.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.479
Yes, but this elevates us in their eyes.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.399
I want them to know our caliber.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
It's their coins,

22:09.401 --> 22:11.119
not their plays that'll raise us up.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.320
Can you do the peanut trick?

22:16.520 --> 22:17.639
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.440
Then die, Queen of Egypt.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.559
Mm-hmm.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.239
Give me my robe. Put on my crown.

22:26.240 --> 22:31.919
I have immortal longings.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.119
Supine congress with a servant?

22:47.120 --> 22:48.879
Never believe that libel.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.239
Well, what else can I believe

22:50.240 --> 22:52.320
when you won't tell me who my father is?

22:54.120 --> 22:58.520
Believe you are my beloved
and seek to know no more.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.879
I wouldn't judge you
for loving a servant.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.200
I just want to understand you.

23:08.960 --> 23:12.559
This rag drags the matter up
from where it should lie dead.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.959
It's vicious mischief.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.920
We have an enemy. That much is clear.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.959
Most magnificent strumpets.

23:30.680 --> 23:31.999
You dogs going with them

23:32.000 --> 23:33.679
or are you gonna stay and pimp me?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.599
Christ.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.679
You won't own me in public.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.679
I'm your ward, not your child.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.119
I believe the story's true.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.439
My father's a servant
and you are ashamed.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.679
Fucking idiots.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.600
I can't do any more of them, Nance.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.559
I charge like a
villain, act like a minx,

24:22.560 --> 24:23.840
and still they come.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.359
One cockstand after another.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.519
You're one of the most
talked about women in London.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.399
And you have wealth.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.199
Yes, but I've no taste for it.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
The rutting.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.719
What do I do, Nance?

24:41.720 --> 24:43.899
Deep down, even I have a taste for it.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.799
It's the pretence you
cannot brook, I think.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.439
You look for love, as I did.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.439
And that is hard, my girl.

24:55.480 --> 24:56.819
Love?

24:58.320 --> 25:00.160
There's no such thing.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.839
There is.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.680
But my birch keeps all that at bay.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.799
I've saved all my gold.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.519
All I've ever earned.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.519
Do you think I could be a bawd?

25:16.520 --> 25:19.339
I remember
your ma once asked me that.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.040
You'd make a fine bawd.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.739
- As good as Charlotte?
- Mmm.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.319
Where is she?

25:31.320 --> 25:33.039
Why is there no rutting?

25:41.560 --> 25:43.399
This is your last chance

25:43.400 --> 25:44.639
to get your dogs off my door.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.120
My muse.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.559
"Happy the man who Charlotte Wells takes"

25:50.560 --> 25:52.959
to her amorous bosom.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.719
For in this Siren of Soho,

25:55.720 --> 25:59.199
lust and grace are so combined

25:59.200 --> 26:01.959
"as to utterly intoxicate."

26:01.960 --> 26:04.759
That's a public act of lewdness.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.919
This is a bawdy and disorderly house.

26:06.920 --> 26:09.079
- Who's the tavern keeper here?
- This man.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.919
- He's our self-named pimp.
- He's set bullies at our door.

26:12.920 --> 26:13.949
And if I'm not mistaken,

26:13.950 --> 26:15.639
he takes a levy from every girl here.

26:15.640 --> 26:16.766
I'm arresting you under

26:16.767 --> 26:19.599
the bawdy and disorderly
houses act of 1752.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.959
You bring the law down upon me?

26:21.960 --> 26:24.399
We're not as helpless or
as friendless as you think.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.039
That is beneath low.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.839
For a man who
feeds himself on flesh?

26:27.840 --> 26:29.799
Stay away from our house, maggot.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.279
You are to be
detained until such time...

26:31.280 --> 26:34.879
Hal! Hal! This is a merry fucking jest.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.439
The charges against you.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.719
We fired the slingshot and
the pimp Goliath is down.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.879
You got a visitor.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.639
He's looking for a loan.

26:59.640 --> 27:02.079
That's not
what... I need your help.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.959
I never should have done it.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.228
I sent my mother to the madhouse

27:05.229 --> 27:07.079
and I haven't slept since.

27:07.080 --> 27:11.119
Charles, your ma is in the right place.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.439
He's lost Golden Square.
It's up for auction.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.458
Come in with me.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.319
Be my partner.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.839
Why would she go into
business with you, Charles?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.919
You gambled that goldmine away.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.039
Charles, I've just bought this place.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.479
Every penny I have is in these walls.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.799
You owe me your help.

27:28.824 --> 27:31.065
How? Your ma's alive, isn't she?

27:31.545 --> 27:33.359
We spared her from the gibbet.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.839
You're free of her, Charles.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.000
I'm on my way to debtor's jail.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.799
Please.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.879
I-I'm sorry. Y... truly.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.120
I can spare you a few
guineas for your needs.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.559
When is that auction, Charles?

27:50.560 --> 27:52.999
No! No! No!

27:57.160 --> 27:59.079
We shall soon
have your nerves restored

27:59.080 --> 28:00.559
and your lusts conquered.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.319
"Downy windows, close."

28:09.320 --> 28:11.519
And golden Phoebus never be beheld.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.439
"Of eyes again so royal."

28:16.920 --> 28:20.479
Absolutely remarkable.
Who'd have believed it?

28:20.480 --> 28:22.759
These duskies reciting the bard.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.239
Bravo.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.839
Who will have the Egyptian Queen?

28:26.840 --> 28:28.519
Look at her thighs.

28:29.320 --> 28:32.159
- Hmm.
- After you.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.039
Come, kind Charmian.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.319
Let me comfort you in your hour of need.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.359
I shall die here.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.199
- In the dark.
- No, no, no.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.079
Resist from within and
they cannot hurt you.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.359
I cannot bear it.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.800
Imagine a flame burning in here.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.879
Don't let them smother it.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.599
Keep it alive, whatever they do.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.359
Even when you think it's gone to smoke,

29:02.360 --> 29:04.920
find a cinder and
breathe it back to life.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.359
How long have you been here?

29:21.360 --> 29:25.000
Oh, one day bleeds into the next.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.680
Perhaps a year.

29:29.440 --> 29:32.080
I was incarcerated by my son.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.359
Lydia Quigley.

29:37.851 --> 29:39.530
Catherine Bottomley.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.679
Miss Bottomley.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.439
You'll need a new name.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.080
Because my family has disowned me?

29:52.240 --> 29:55.119
Because out there is a city
where your future awaits.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.199
I tell you for true,

29:57.200 --> 30:00.839
you could have London
wrapped around your fingers

30:00.840 --> 30:03.160
like a dazzling string of pearls.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.919
Alas, you are mad.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.920
Mr. Quigley?

30:33.640 --> 30:36.080
I'm one of Charlotte's
girls, Miss Lambert.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.760
I sometimes come here
to visit my friend.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.999
I don't know why I'm here.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.019
That seems as good a reason as any.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.839
I'm a vile wretch.

30:53.042 --> 30:54.682
I've lost everything.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.879
It's a good job your mother's in Bedlam,

30:57.880 --> 31:00.119
otherwise she'd blast you
with a cannon ball, won't she?

31:04.605 --> 31:06.204
What's her name?

31:06.229 --> 31:07.468
It's Kitty.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.120
Hello, Miss Kitty.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.160
Thank you.

31:26.987 --> 31:29.006
Fredo, here's that remarkable girl.

31:29.720 --> 31:33.959
We saw you last night,
tormenting your betters.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.839
- We were dazzled.
- Lucy Wells.

31:36.840 --> 31:39.559
Mrs. Harvey. This is Fredo, my son.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.280
I rise in her east and set in her west.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.359
- Will you bid?
- Will you?

31:46.360 --> 31:47.959
It's a wonderful property.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.119
It's quite perfect.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.119
I hope it ends up in the right hands.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.280
It will.

32:01.960 --> 32:06.479
100. 150.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.939
200. 250.

32:11.440 --> 32:15.519
300. 350.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.676
400.

32:20.916 --> 32:22.495
450.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.079
500.

32:25.104 --> 32:26.517
Why are we bidding against each other?

32:26.541 --> 32:27.620
I want this place.

32:27.645 --> 32:29.575
So do I, but these
puckfists have more money.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.239
- 550.
- We could both get it.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.239
- How?
- Be reckless, join forces.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.459
- Ma.
- I know nothing of you.

32:34.484 --> 32:35.583
575.

32:35.608 --> 32:37.804
The bold decision is often the best.

32:37.829 --> 32:39.071
600.

32:40.640 --> 32:44.079
- I've got 200.
- I can raise 400.

32:44.104 --> 32:45.943
Do I hear 600?

32:48.872 --> 32:50.672
Any advance on 600?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.339
600.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.199
To the ladies.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.239
20 pound fine and the law's
now got us in its sights.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.439
- That bitch is going to pay.
- No, you're gonna pay.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.799
We said we'd start
with the little houses

33:19.800 --> 33:21.319
going slowly, street by street.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.079
We said we'd advance into Soho.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.479
So you swagger into the top house

33:24.480 --> 33:25.839
and think it'll fall in your lap?

33:25.840 --> 33:27.399
You've forgotten your tactics.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.839
We move onto new land
and penetrate the center.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.079
This isn't a battle. We
could have wealth here.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.920
Don't be fucking mad.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.719
Your mistress has cost me sore.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.399
Tell her I'm coming for my money.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.599
You know your mum's a dirty whore

33:48.600 --> 33:50.639
who calls a cunt a cunt?

33:52.040 --> 33:53.719
All righty.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.319
Is this her?

34:10.320 --> 34:12.480
Yes, uh, Lydia Quigley, yes.

34:20.760 --> 34:21.840
Leave us.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.967
Lady Isabella.

34:28.081 --> 34:30.239
How kind of you to come.

34:31.520 --> 34:35.199
There's libel in the press
and I'm sure it hails from you.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.359
- So I've come to warn you.
- Warn me?

34:42.400 --> 34:45.918
With what?

34:45.920 --> 34:50.478
If I could, I would print
my outrage on every page,

34:50.480 --> 34:54.478
but as you can see, I have no pen!

34:54.480 --> 34:56.478
Such dangerous items are kept from us

34:56.480 --> 34:59.839
lest we spear our visitors' eyeballs!

34:59.840 --> 35:01.319
You once labored with my brother

35:01.320 --> 35:03.479
to bring this vile calamity on me.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.839
I did. And here's your bed.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.719
I'll welcome you when you arrive.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.239
You are toothless.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.920
One day I will bite my
way back into the sun.

35:18.200 --> 35:22.880
Give my regards to your
succubus, dear Charlotte.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.480
Tell her I think of her every day.

35:31.960 --> 35:33.879
Get her cleaned and dressed.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.360
And unlock that monstrous shackle.

35:38.080 --> 35:41.039
I want her forced to take my charity.

35:41.501 --> 35:43.581
Make her kiss the ground in thanks.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.859
And never, ever let her go.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.000
She's as dangerous as you say.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.999
Charles. Charles!

35:58.000 --> 36:00.319
Charles!

36:00.320 --> 36:03.399
Hell devour you for what you've done!

36:03.400 --> 36:05.119
Charles!

36:16.560 --> 36:18.391
My beautiful boy.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.879
I-I keep thinking I'm seeing him.

36:28.480 --> 36:32.079
Heaven, don't let me be mad.

36:32.080 --> 36:36.839
Don't let me be mad.
Don't let me be mad!

36:36.840 --> 36:39.279
Please don't let me be mad!

36:42.680 --> 36:45.680
Don't let me be mad!

36:48.800 --> 36:51.599
This will be our emporium.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.919
In here we'll have velvet,

36:52.920 --> 36:54.879
silk, even ribbons for the shoes.

36:54.880 --> 36:59.079
In the upper rooms
it's clandestine sport.

36:59.080 --> 37:02.239
Not with me. I've put
my money in to retire.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.359
I want the least amount of fucks
for the most amount of money.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.239
Miss Wells, I promise you
the greatest entertainment

37:08.240 --> 37:10.479
and the fewest fucks you have ever had.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.520
- You're a molly.
- I'm a genius with a needle.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.159
You've brought me into a molly house.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.639
It's a place of refuge.

37:25.898 --> 37:28.297
Where men like my son can
be themselves in peace.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.639
How does it pay?

37:30.640 --> 37:33.999
It's a hanging offense, so double.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.159
Not again.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.959
You're a sinkhole, Charles.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.280
I've sent enough coins into the depths.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.599
Her time costs, friend.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.319
I've got your next
cull in there, Chadwick.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.920
Unless this one's got gold.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.119
I wanted more for you than this.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.599
Go away!

38:00.800 --> 38:01.959
You threw me out.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.200
Don't come begging for my coinage.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.919
Is my warlord launching an offensive?

38:26.600 --> 38:28.239
Charles Quigley?

38:28.240 --> 38:29.279
He's here!

38:29.280 --> 38:30.280
There he is!

38:36.320 --> 38:39.199
The rage was coming off him like heat.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.639
He won't drop it, Charlotte.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.999
Oh, I don't think him that low.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.160
Bastard!

38:46.057 --> 38:47.216
His men are back.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.119
There'll be no trading here tonight.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.199
Nor any night that you're here.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.039
I want you in my bed.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.959
Be my mistress. Ten pounds a week.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.999
And we could have this
rollicking night and day.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.999
Oh, for 30 a week, did you say?

39:11.000 --> 39:14.359
You jest with me.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.519
If you teach me the art of trade,

39:16.520 --> 39:18.079
I might make do on less.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.479
I've learned reading and arithmetic.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.400
I help run this tavern now.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.159
I want to learn the art of commerce.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.919
Lesson one.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.679
Commerce is the art of war.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.640
My tutelage and 20 pounds a week.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.359
25.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.319
I'll... I'll prepare my
bed, blonde whirlwind.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.879
Charlotte's out.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.679
Cockfighting.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.480
I've come from Bedlam.

39:59.240 --> 40:02.840
She called Charlotte my
succubus, spitting hate.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.219
She's in torment. As I was in her house.

40:08.120 --> 40:10.160
When I was 12 years old.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.880
Why did you go?

40:14.960 --> 40:17.519
There's hateful
gossip in the press.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.519
And you think Quigley wrote it?

40:19.520 --> 40:21.520
I had to be sure she did not.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.519
Now I fear it's my brother.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.039
Or one of his agents.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.199
Where is he?

40:28.200 --> 40:30.879
To my knowledge, in Venice.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.839
Where I hope he drowns.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.240
I'll drink to that.

40:41.960 --> 40:44.019
It's Sophia I feel for.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.439
She believes the lies.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.799
Perhaps I've invited
this censure myself.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.840
How?

40:54.120 --> 40:56.519
By shaking my own reputation.

40:58.803 --> 41:02.302
You have health, fortune,

41:03.280 --> 41:05.800
a child who loves you.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.879
Your reputation is a burden.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.339
I have none.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.239
And I'm free as a crow.

41:14.591 --> 41:18.991
If I were you, I'd
own my scandal proudly.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.320
Pour one for yourself.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.080
And what would your mother say?

42:00.240 --> 42:01.240
Come on.

42:01.241 --> 42:02.319
Join us.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.759
Yes.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.039
We're like magnets, Miss Wells.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.119
You cannot keep away.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.879
I've gathered
near every bawd in Soho.

42:13.880 --> 42:15.359
You cannot trick and threaten us all,

42:15.360 --> 42:16.999
not now your methods are known.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.599
To show my intention,

42:18.600 --> 42:21.559
I've started a list to rival yours.

42:21.560 --> 42:26.039
First entry, Isaac,
Cock of Villiers Street.

42:26.040 --> 42:30.719
Beady eyes, darting hands,
and sinews made for love.

42:30.720 --> 42:34.239
His wattles are like ripest plums,

42:34.240 --> 42:37.839
and his breath lingers,
hot as melting cheese.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.479
Dirty boy!

42:39.480 --> 42:41.759
But a lady
should look to her pockets,

42:41.760 --> 42:47.039
for this magnet of a man, in
spite of his poetic tongue,

42:47.040 --> 42:51.039
is a thief of the lowest order.

42:52.680 --> 42:54.959
We'll do business as we always have.

42:56.132 --> 42:57.291
With bawds at the helm.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.199
Pincher girls,
come join your sisters

43:01.200 --> 43:03.119
for a drink at the Boar's Head.

43:08.880 --> 43:11.399
Can't believe you took
on Charlotte Wells.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.479
You'll never win.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.119
Tell your drab to button it.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.599
Why don't you leave off picking on women

43:16.600 --> 43:19.319
and look for better
ways to expand your cash?

43:19.320 --> 43:21.280
Don't talk to him like that.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.280
I'm going to my new keeper's.

43:31.880 --> 43:34.690
- That girl is strife.
- You've stirred this strife.

43:34.691 --> 43:35.959
Not Emily.

43:35.960 --> 43:38.239
Should I go around Charlotte
Wells with a posy to say sorry?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.813
It's too late for that.

43:39.814 --> 43:42.719
She's inciting mutiny among our girls.

43:42.720 --> 43:45.320
So do what you like, but end it.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.879
That fine
lady was afraid of you.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.639
I once held her future in my palm.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.039
How?

44:06.040 --> 44:08.359
I was arrogant, self-righteous,

44:08.360 --> 44:09.699
ruthless.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.360
I took gold for keeping secrets.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.919
I've hardly been out of my village.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.680
I know nothing of the world.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.160
I fear I'll never see it.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.399
Tell me your story.

44:34.720 --> 44:38.959
I was the High Priestess of bawds.

44:38.960 --> 44:44.000
And my girls were like... princesses.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.479
We're drinking. Join us?

45:03.011 --> 45:04.670
Perfectly happy by myself.

45:05.440 --> 45:06.639
Have you eaten?

45:08.240 --> 45:10.000
I'm stuffed full of roast.

45:16.200 --> 45:18.039
Don't be offended, will you?

45:31.280 --> 45:33.799
Lucy Wells!

45:33.800 --> 45:35.879
What have you done?

45:35.880 --> 45:37.199
I didn't have enough for the full sale

45:37.200 --> 45:39.039
so I was resourceful.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.319
We all have one third each,
but she doesn't know about you.

45:41.320 --> 45:45.039
The last Wells girl in Golden Square

45:45.040 --> 45:47.399
threw her bawd into Bedlam.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.199
Lucy Wells is the girl of the hour.

45:49.200 --> 45:51.719
And another layer to our gossamer veil.

45:51.720 --> 45:55.439
Don't fret. She's
easily played, I'm sure.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.999
Lady Isabella,
this is a gentleman's club.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.680
Your presence will cause scandal.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.999
I have a daughter born out of wedlock.

46:19.200 --> 46:21.579
If that's a scandal, then I own it.

46:22.480 --> 46:25.160
For her love is my greatest blessing.

46:27.560 --> 46:30.439
I hope that's printed
in tomorrow's press.

46:30.791 --> 46:34.271
For neither she nor I will
bow our heads to your censure.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.760
This is unfitting.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.919
I strongly suggest you leave.

46:42.342 --> 46:43.602
Lord Leadsom.

46:44.840 --> 46:49.240
I see your wife's moral welfare
is ever in your thoughts.

47:40.320 --> 47:43.519
Mmm, good girl. Good girl.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.600
You should go home.

48:06.280 --> 48:09.520
You could have had all this freely.

48:12.400 --> 48:16.080
This trade turns us into rats.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.019
I mean it.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.320
Fly away home.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.119
You know what it is to be reckless.

48:39.120 --> 48:42.219
I am a part owner of a molly house.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.999
Lucy, those places end in a noose.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.679
It's a daring adventure,
though, isn't it?

49:08.120 --> 49:09.839
Come on. It's all right.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.319
Here, good girl.

49:11.320 --> 49:13.759
Help!

49:13.760 --> 49:15.759
Help!

49:24.600 --> 49:26.639
Charlotte!

49:26.640 --> 49:27.879
Nancy!

49:30.360 --> 49:31.879
Kitty! No!

49:31.880 --> 49:34.559
Kitty!

49:34.560 --> 49:37.719
Come.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.959
Nancy, we're here!

49:38.960 --> 49:40.959
Nancy!

49:46.600 --> 49:48.359
Take the child. I can't breathe.

49:48.360 --> 49:50.759
Call the warden! Fire!

49:53.920 --> 49:55.719
Kitty!

49:55.720 --> 49:58.279
- It's okay, I've got you.
- Is she safe?

49:59.880 --> 50:01.479
Nancy's inside.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.479
Nancy!

50:03.480 --> 50:06.519
Help me carry her, Luce.

50:15.840 --> 50:19.479
Your house. And your money.

50:19.480 --> 50:20.679
Quick, before it's too late!

50:20.680 --> 50:21.899
Let it burn.

50:23.884 --> 50:26.883
These houses, let them all burn.

51:02.920 --> 51:04.639
How far from London can I get?

51:25.760 --> 51:27.519
Be it now or months from hence,

51:27.520 --> 51:29.519
I swear I'll get you out.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.559
Must I be a harlot?

51:33.560 --> 51:35.659
If that is your choice.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.059
And if it is,

51:39.360 --> 51:41.479
I'll take you to where I long to be.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.679
My most beloved home in Golden Square.
