Holden's there?

02:49.503 --> 02:50.969
Put the tablet between you.

02:50.971 --> 02:54.439

at all times.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.242

03:12.226 --> 03:14.326

03:14.328 --> 03:15.460
Yes! Yeah!

03:15.462 --> 03:16.662
This is, uh,
this is the place

03:16.664 --> 03:19.198
where SkyVolt discovers
his superpowers.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.532
Well, you know what?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.467
It's been so great
to talk about SkyVolt,

03:22.469 --> 03:24.870
but let's talk about
the real Liv Rooney.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.407
-Oh.
-I heard a rumor
there is a boyfriend.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.042
Oh.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.211
Well, I am very sorry

to disappoint you

watching at home,
but, um... but no.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.383
I just, you know,
I don't really have time

03:38.385 --> 03:39.952

03:47.595 --> 03:50.395

you were terrific!

03:50.397 --> 03:51.730
That was great!

03:51.732 --> 03:53.265
Hey, uh, Holden...

03:53.267 --> 03:55.567
come down here

I'm watching you, buddy.

Bye!

04:02.610 --> 04:04.076
Dad likes you so much.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.713
Hey, Liv, why, um...

04:07.715 --> 04:09.615
why did you lie
about us dating?

04:10.551 --> 04:12.951
I just don't want to put
any extra pressure on us.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.853
You know, things have just
been going so well

04:14.855 --> 04:16.755
and I think the media would
mess all that up.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.424
Yeah, but it just took us
so long to start dating,

04:19.426 --> 04:22.227
and I'm excited
about us, you know?

04:22.229 --> 04:24.463
I hate the idea
of hiding our relationship.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.699
I'm excited about us too
and we're gonna get there,

04:27.701 --> 04:29.601
but right now
all I care about

04:29.603 --> 04:31.937
is having a lovely evening
with my guy.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.705
-Okay.
-Dad texted me.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.408
-Told me to plant my keister
right between you two lovebirds.
-Oh, oh!

04:36.410 --> 04:38.310
-Oh, oh...
-Oh, no. Sorry.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.519
Oh, this is so sweet!

04:48.656 --> 04:52.824
20 best bro points
for renting us these!

04:52.826 --> 04:55.994
Oh, Holden, isn't this
the most fun ever?

04:57.164 --> 04:58.630
Yeah, man.
It's... it's super fun.

potential chum?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.679
Seriously?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.614
Yeah! Yeah, dude.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.149
No one's ever opened up
to me before.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.019
Something's just
been bothering me

05:21.021 --> 05:22.688
about my relationship
with Liv.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.822
I...

05:23.824 --> 05:25.457
I had no idea
that dating a celebrity

05:25.459 --> 05:26.958
would be this tough.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.293
I mean, we're finally together

05:28.295 --> 05:29.995
and she wants to
keep it a secret.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.097
I hear ya, Holden.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.633
Ten points for pouring out
your soul to me.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.056

my worlds separate,

06:31.058 --> 06:32.491
so I think that
we'll be on our way.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.194
Perhaps there's
a common activity

06:36.196 --> 06:37.696
that could bring us together.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.564
Like... jacks.

I don't do jacks.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.640

my two worlds together?

07:21.642 --> 07:23.542
I do like to slurp.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.544
This strikes me
as serendipitous.

Respect.

The rest of the world doesn't.

08:38.552 --> 08:42.153
Okay, this is exactly why

08:42.155 --> 08:44.556
I wanted to keep us out
of the media.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.558
I mean, they twist everything.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.460

08:48.462 --> 08:51.530
Yes, but now
we're not us, Liv.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.231

Okay, Joey.
I'm gonna fix it.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.750
You're gonna fix this? How?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.919
Josh went to Goofy Gary's

09:13.921 --> 09:15.086
without me.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.225

10:16.917 --> 10:18.416
Josh is teaching me acting.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.485
I can't believe you guys
get paid for this stuff.

10:20.487 --> 10:21.853
So dumb.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.324
Well, I'm glad that you two
are taking this so well.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.960
Um, I'm gonna talk to Nancy
to clear things up.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.829
All right. I gotta go.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.896
-Okay.
-Today was fun.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.465
Yeah, it was so fun!

10:34.901 --> 10:36.901
I'm gonna call
Nancy right now.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.337
-(gasps)
-(clattering)

10:41.008 --> 10:42.007
Don't call her.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.074
Why?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.409
(sighs)

10:44.411 --> 10:47.278
Because Diggie doesn't know
that I'm dating anybody,

10:47.280 --> 10:48.913
and if you say that
that was me with Josh,

10:48.915 --> 10:50.415
then he's gonna find out
over the Internet,

10:50.417 --> 10:51.616
and that's really crummy.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.817
Just...

10:52.819 --> 10:54.586
please let me tell him myself.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.956
Um, Maddie,
I promised Holden--

10:57.958 --> 10:59.190
Liv, please?

11:01.628 --> 11:02.761
Okay.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.930
I can wait
until you talk
to Diggie.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.033
I guess Holden will understand.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.835
Could you just do me
one quick favor?

11:10.837 --> 11:12.037
Just take out your phone.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.371
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.706
Yeah, it's not
a big... Just...

11:14.708 --> 11:15.774
-Wha?
-(clattering)

11:18.311 --> 11:19.844
My phone had to
be avenged.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.686
And is this your card?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.020
No.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.822
Because this one is.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.890
(gasps)

11:33.060 --> 11:35.527
Oh! It is!

11:35.529 --> 11:38.897
20 points
for close up magic, Josh!

11:38.899 --> 11:41.800
How could I stay mad at you?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.068
(door opens)

11:43.070 --> 11:45.704
Ooh, a deck of cards?

11:45.706 --> 11:47.872
The wonders
of the Rooney house
are endless.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.476
Josh is showing me
magic tricks.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.911
He's competing with Holden

11:52.913 --> 11:55.980
to be my new cool best bro!

11:55.982 --> 11:57.982
Making two guys who are
much cooler than you

11:57.984 --> 11:59.417
compete to be your friend?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.419
Seems like the greatest
magic trick of all.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.656
See ya.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.664
Oh, good.
Evan, you're here.

12:12.666 --> 12:13.865
Where else would I be?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.500
My mom says when
you make a commitment,

12:15.502 --> 12:17.669
you need to stick to it,
and I'm stickin'.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.107
Okay, so what's this
doohickey gotta do

12:22.109 --> 12:23.942
with us winning
the Slurp Down Showdown?

12:23.944 --> 12:26.878
Okay, the key to winning
is to slurp as fast as possible

12:26.880 --> 12:28.780
without getting
a brain freeze.

12:28.782 --> 12:33.752
So, I invented Dr. P's
Brain Freeze Slurp-o-meter.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.623
Gumball Machine,
who's this Dr. P?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.892
It's his middle school nickname.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.994
Mine's Vampire
because I bit a kid.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.398
Gumball, you have
another nickname

12:47.400 --> 12:48.967
and you never said nothin'?

12:48.969 --> 12:50.635
It's like I don't even know you.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.272
Okay, can we please
practice for the Slurp Down?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.740
Sure...

12:55.742 --> 12:57.008
Dr. P.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.381
As he's slurping,
the machine is blowing

13:03.383 --> 13:04.983
colder and colder air.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.918
-(slurping)
-(beeping)

13:06.920 --> 13:09.220
Hey, you gotta pace
your slurping and stay out

13:09.222 --> 13:11.122
of the blue brain freeze zone.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.824
-Slow down.
-(beeping)

13:12.826 --> 13:13.992
(beeping, alarm blares)

13:13.994 --> 13:16.327
(screams)

13:16.329 --> 13:17.629
Brain freeze!

13:19.399 --> 13:20.698
That was funny.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.803
(doorbell)

13:28.108 --> 13:30.008
Hello, my handsome date!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.477
-Hello, my gorgeous gal!
-Hi!

13:32.479 --> 13:34.846
Are you ready for a night
of dinner and dancing?

13:34.848 --> 13:36.114
Yes, I am.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.951
Um, just really quickly
before we go,

13:39.953 --> 13:42.787
I want to talk to you
about this Nancy O'Dell thing.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.155
Oh. Did you clear it up?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.624
No, not exactly.

13:46.626 --> 13:50.195
Um... Maddie actually
asked me not to.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.565
Why?

13:55.202 --> 13:59.604
She doesn't want Diggie to know
that she's dating somebody new,

13:59.606 --> 14:02.540
so she's trying
to protect his feelings.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.576
(stammering)
Um, okay.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.745
What about my feelings?

14:09.049 --> 14:11.716
I care about your feelings.

14:11.718 --> 14:15.220
It's just Maddie's my sister,
and if she needs me

14:15.222 --> 14:17.222
-to do something for her,
I'm going to.
-Mm-hmm.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.192
But come on.

14:21.194 --> 14:25.163
Who cares about
what the media thinks
about us, you know?

14:25.165 --> 14:27.599
We know what we have.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.601
Do we?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.871
What?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.007
Holden, are you seriously

14:36.009 --> 14:37.075
-upset about this?
-Yeah.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.045
Yeah, Liv, I am.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.816
You promised you'd fix this.

14:44.818 --> 14:47.418
And I will,
just not right now.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.653
But when?

14:50.423 --> 14:53.858
It always seems like
I'm waiting for something.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.727
You know?

14:55.729 --> 14:59.030
First it was Andie,
and then it was<i> Voltage,</i>

14:59.032 --> 15:04.035
and now it's Maddie's feelings
and somehow Diggie's feelings.

15:05.205 --> 15:09.040
There's always something more
important than our relationship

15:09.042 --> 15:10.942
and I'm supposed to just...

15:10.944 --> 15:13.778
stand by
and be okay with it?

15:15.615 --> 15:19.350
Holden, I really
care about you,

15:19.352 --> 15:22.287
but I care about a lot
of things in my life.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.590
And that's one of the reasons
why I like you so much.

15:28.361 --> 15:33.631
I want this relationship
to be my everything,

15:33.633 --> 15:36.501
and you might just
want this to be...

15:38.305 --> 15:39.938
one of your things.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.642
What are you saying?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.213
Maybe it just isn't our time.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.451
-Holden--
-Liv...

15:58.258 --> 15:59.791
I can't do this.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.297
We need to break up.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.104
(door opens)

16:13.106 --> 16:14.539
-(sobs)
-(door closes)

16:19.612 --> 16:23.915
-(sobbing)
-I am so sorry, Liv.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.817
Oh, breakups are heard.

16:25.819 --> 16:29.921
But brought along
some old friends
to make it easier.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.356
We have the punching pillow.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.224
Ooh! To let the anger out...

16:34.961 --> 16:37.462
and we have
the hugging pillow

16:37.464 --> 16:39.263
to let the sadness out...

16:40.834 --> 16:43.968
and their helpful, new friend,

16:43.970 --> 16:46.371
the look who's
gonna be okay pillow.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.706
Who's in the mirror, Liv?

16:51.211 --> 16:53.611
-Me.
-That's who's gonna be okay.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.186
This is all my fault.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.353
I never should have stopped you
from calling Nancy O'Dell.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.956
I'm sorry.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.791
But you can--
I mean, you can call

17:06.793 --> 17:08.526
and fix this, right?

17:08.528 --> 17:12.163
And then you and Holden
can get back together.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.364
No.

17:15.301 --> 17:17.635
No, 'cause Holden was right.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.339
I have way too much
going on in my life

17:21.341 --> 17:23.374
to give him
what he needs right now.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.911
It's really not
your fault, Maddie.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.746
It's my fault.

17:28.748 --> 17:32.383
It is nobody's fault, Liv.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.819
Sometimes you date someone

17:34.821 --> 17:36.988
and it doesn't work out.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.424
-Yeah.
-Yes, it hurts.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.927
But eventually,
you'll feel better.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.162
(groans)

17:44.164 --> 17:47.365
(groans)

17:47.367 --> 17:52.336
Guys, how am I ever gonna
choose between Josh and Holden?

17:52.338 --> 17:53.538
Holden and I broke up.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.239
Josh it is.

17:59.512 --> 18:04.182
Let the Slurp Down
Showdown begin!

18:04.184 --> 18:05.883
-(whistle)
-<i> (upbeat music playing)</i>

18:05.885 --> 18:08.786
Go! Slurp, slurp, slurp,
slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp!

18:08.788 --> 18:09.954
Hey, sorry I'm late.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.355
Don't take any points away.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.792
You don't need
any more points...

18:14.794 --> 18:16.961
new cool best bro!

18:16.963 --> 18:18.296
What? I won!

18:18.298 --> 18:20.064
Yes!

18:20.066 --> 18:22.366
Winner, winner,
chicken cha-cha dinner.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.602
Now let's get
our Goofy Gary on.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.438
Both:
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo ♪

18:27.440 --> 18:28.773
♪ Doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo ♪

18:30.443 --> 18:32.376
Aah!

18:32.378 --> 18:33.778
Brain freeze!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.381
Go on without me, little dudes!

18:37.383 --> 18:39.217
I'm no good to you anymore.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.255
Why are we here again?

18:44.257 --> 18:47.725
Because you needed
cheering up.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.328
Oh, and the Slurp Down
is also sick!

18:58.071 --> 18:59.237
(crowd groans)

19:01.441 --> 19:03.508
(crowd groans)

19:03.510 --> 19:05.543
Aah! Brain freeze!

19:07.981 --> 19:09.647
Come on, Vampire!

19:09.649 --> 19:12.383
Open up that abnormally
petite esophagus!

19:13.453 --> 19:15.520
Slurp till you burp!

19:20.994 --> 19:22.093
(burps)

19:22.095 --> 19:25.530
We win!
I'm a bad man!

19:25.532 --> 19:27.198
(cheers and applause)

19:31.838 --> 19:34.372
Okay, that was
kind of awesome.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.474
-Thanks, Maddie.
-Right?

19:36.476 --> 19:38.376
I never miss it.
Uh, why don't you go

19:38.378 --> 19:40.111
find us a table
and I'll go grab some menus.

19:40.113 --> 19:41.412
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.686
Diggie?

19:49.656 --> 19:51.856
Hey, Rooney.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.161
(stammers)
Why-- You're supposed to be

19:57.163 --> 19:59.530
in Australia
for two more months!

19:59.532 --> 20:02.500
I know, and I was...

20:02.502 --> 20:06.537
but then I saw this picture
of you dating this Josh guy.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.639
That was Liv.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.341
-I--
-No, it wasn't.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.709
I-- I know it was you, Maddie.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.881
I saw you with someone else
and I-- I just...

20:17.984 --> 20:19.884
Maddie, I came back for you.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.256
-Whoa.
-(chuckles)

20:25.258 --> 20:27.425
Both:
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo ♪

20:27.427 --> 20:28.893
(gasps)

20:28.895 --> 20:30.161
Diggie!

20:31.397 --> 20:32.496
It's you!

20:32.498 --> 20:35.166
It's you, Diggie!
It's always been you!

20:36.903 --> 20:40.037
My original cool best bro!

20:40.039 --> 20:41.172
Oh!

20:41.174 --> 20:42.773
Let's go make up
for lost time!

20:46.779 --> 20:49.447
Maddie, what is
Diggie doing here?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.549
He saw that photo
with me and Josh.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.651
You were supposed to
explain that to him.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.555
You didn't tell him?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.590
I couldn't do it.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.395
He came back for me.

21:06.866 --> 21:10.534
But you want to be
with Josh, right?

21:11.938 --> 21:13.104
(sighs)

21:15.608 --> 21:16.440
Or...

21:17.977 --> 21:20.177
do you want to
be with Diggie?

21:27.654 --> 21:28.619
Maddie?

21:42.602 --> 21:44.602
-Holden!
-Hey.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.971
(stammers)
Hi. I-- I wasn't
expecting to see you.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.473
Okay, that's clearly not true.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.741
I'm sitting
on your porch swing.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.879
Yeah.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.481
Why?

21:57.483 --> 21:59.750
Well, um...

21:59.752 --> 22:01.585
it's because I--
I wasn't sure

22:01.587 --> 22:05.523
if an ex-boyfriend
rings the doorbell

22:05.525 --> 22:09.827
or knocks, so I--
I sat down to think about it...

22:09.829 --> 22:11.195
for, like, an hour.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.899
Well...

22:17.337 --> 22:19.003
to be fair...

22:19.005 --> 22:23.708
I have driven
by your house
six times today.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.109
-Oh. Oh.
-Yeah.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.944
I was about to go
make it seven.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.315
I brought you a breakup cake.

22:31.317 --> 22:32.516
I mean, an apology cake.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.618
It's actually
a chocolate lava cake.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.354
Um...

22:36.356 --> 22:38.656
I just...

22:38.658 --> 22:41.892
I feel bad about how
everything came out.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.429
I really do too.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.900
I don't think
you were wrong though.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.538
I think we're just on
really different pages
right now.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.374
Yeah.

22:58.644 --> 23:00.144
Yeah.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.480
I just hope that we can...

23:02.482 --> 23:04.415
be friends again someday.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.584
Yes. I would love that.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.952
(both chuckle)

23:09.422 --> 23:11.756
Well, I should go.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.695
Oh, um, real quick,

23:17.697 --> 23:20.731
don't let Joey
eat any of that cake.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.533
I didn't win
the best bro contest,

23:22.535 --> 23:24.535
so he's kind of
on my list.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.704
(both chuckle)

23:26.706 --> 23:28.272
Seriously. Don't.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.511
