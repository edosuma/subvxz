I'm not vegan at all,

16:48.074 --> 16:49.842

I feel sick.

Thank you so much.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.483

16:57.483 --> 16:59.986
Yes, thank you.
So we're actually best friends

16:59.986 --> 17:01.787
who met in undergrad
at Berkeley.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.623
Cha: We've been best friends
for 15 years.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.858
Both our parents
immigrated here from Korea

17:05.858 --> 17:07.894
and started
their own businesses,

17:07.894 --> 17:09.996
really came here
for their American dream.

17:09.996 --> 17:14.133
And after we both got our MBAs
separately, I was at MIT.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.968
You're an MBA from MIT?
Yes.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.370
What was your specialty
or focus?

17:17.370 --> 17:18.804
I focused on operations.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.673
And I focused on
marketing.
Geez.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.576
So you're asking
for $600,000, 7.5%.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.944
That's a pretty
punchy valuation.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.481
So I'm assuming now
this has sold like hot bananas.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.783
We launched in 2017.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.686
We had $35,000 in sales,

17:33.686 --> 17:36.389
and since then, we've grown
double year‐over‐year.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.425
Year to date,
we've made $1 million.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.160
Wow!
We're gonna
end this year

17:41.160 --> 17:43.162
$1.7 million in revenue,

17:43.162 --> 17:44.530
and that's
a very conservative number.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.865
And what's your profit?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.967
We're running a loss
at about $400,000.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.635
‐Uh‐oh!
‐Wow.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.706
Greiner: Okay, so why do you
feel that you're running a loss?
So why the valuation?

17:53.706 --> 17:57.143
So the food industry,
I'm sure you're all aware,

17:57.143 --> 17:59.612
you know, it's a really
cash‐intensive business.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.647
You know, when you get into
a grocery store,

18:01.647 --> 18:03.482
you need to first pay for
that marketing

18:03.482 --> 18:05.384
to be able to be there
and to reach those consumers.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.119
'Cause you're going after
the frozen section.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.255
Hard to displace
other products.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.891
Yes, we've fought tooth and nail
for every position

18:11.891 --> 18:15.962
we've been in, and the frozen
space is very competitive.

18:15.962 --> 18:19.365
Where the growth has been
is dairy‐free and novelties,

18:19.365 --> 18:22.034
so that's really our sweet spot
of where we're heading.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.337
And we have kept
our shelf space

18:24.337 --> 18:27.740
in all the new doors.
What stores are you in?
We don't even know.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.910
Tell us what stores you're in,
what does it cost,

18:30.910 --> 18:32.511
and what does it cost
for you to make it.

18:32.511 --> 18:35.381
We're available nationally
at Sprouts Farmers Market

18:35.381 --> 18:38.184
and as well as in certain
regions of Whole Foods.

18:38.184 --> 18:41.087
This year we launched
in Costco.
Costco.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.289
We tested with them
last year...

18:43.289 --> 18:46.492
And it was wildly successful.
...and blew them
out of the water.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.295
They retail for $5.99
on shelf typically.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.731
And our cost of goods
is $1.80.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.066
So how much money
have you raised, if any,

18:54.066 --> 18:55.201
and from who?

18:55.201 --> 18:57.970
We both invested $200,000
of our own money

18:57.970 --> 18:59.271
right off the bat.
Oh, good for you.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.573
Okay, you're serious.

19:00.573 --> 19:04.543
We also raised in the last
5 years $1.4 million...

19:04.543 --> 19:06.012
‐Ooh.
‐Wow.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.381
...from friends and family,
and then angels

19:08.381 --> 19:11.150
and institutional.
What valuation was
the $1.4 million raised at?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.252
We're actually in a seed round
right now.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.487
Which is why we're here.
We're here.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.224
We're raising at
an $8 million valuation,

19:18.224 --> 19:20.593
so this is part
of the seed round right now.

Wait, okay, guys,

Do you not think you're
gonna have to negotiate?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.372
Yeah, we're ready
to negotiate,

the other investors

We really appreciate
the feedback.

O'Leary: You know,
there's two problems.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.871
You're not worth
8 million bucks.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.741
You're also asking for
$600,000.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.009
Part of your strategy
on "Shark Tank",

20:10.009 --> 20:11.610
you have to decide
how much you're asking for.

20:11.610 --> 20:15.014
Yes.
Yes.
You're in
the top quartile of ask.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.049
It's too much for me.
I'm out.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.319
I just want to say, I've
invested in a business

20:20.319 --> 20:22.555
like this,
actually on "Dragons' Den".

20:22.555 --> 20:24.990
It was exactly as you've
got here, in essence.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.826
So it was
frozen dessert.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.194
What happened to
that business?

20:28.194 --> 20:32.064
Whilst the sales were going up,
but sadly, the margin reduced.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.301
Because as we got into
Whole Foods, Costco, and others

20:35.301 --> 20:36.569
and all the supermarkets,

20:36.569 --> 20:38.370
they wanted to have
the product 2‐for‐1.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.573
They want to have the specials.
They want to have the end cap.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.743
Every single quarter,
another marketing initiative.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.112
When the brand then started
to actually go down,

20:46.112 --> 20:47.480
we had to invest more.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.382
We ended up with less than
3% or 4% net margin

20:50.382 --> 20:51.383
every single year.

20:51.383 --> 20:52.852
What ended up happening

20:52.852 --> 20:57.022
was that the manufacturer was
making more money than we were.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.224
Mm‐hmm.

Guys, the problem I have ‐‐
Look, the products are good,

21:08.734 --> 21:10.636
they're just not
differentiated enough.

21:10.636 --> 21:14.206
I get that they're clean,
natural, wholesome ingredients.
Yes.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.508
But there are
multiple products,

21:15.508 --> 21:18.177

that meet that criteria

what I think, okay?

Because I really know
this space, actually...

21:41.534 --> 21:44.103
Yes.            Yes.
...because I did a deal a year
ago with Frozen Farmer,

21:44.103 --> 21:46.505
and we created
what we call Frobert,

21:46.505 --> 21:51.210
which was a combination
of sorbet and ice cream.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.145
You know, everybody up here
at the time said,

21:53.145 --> 21:56.015
"Oh, my God, brutal space.
You're never gonna make it."

It was a hard road,

$20 million in sales this year.

with my Frozen Farmer

being fair to her

in another ice cream line.

And then we also have
a consumer

25:10.476 --> 25:12.845

the fraternity college market.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.313
Do you have
any competition?

25:14.313 --> 25:17.583
Yes, there is multiple companies
that started in this space,

25:17.583 --> 25:21.353

the ‐‐ the space.

25:21.353 --> 25:24.757
So the story is we found
a Kickstarter campaign online

25:24.757 --> 25:25.824
for the male romper.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.693
Now here it was May

25:27.693 --> 25:29.928
and they weren't delivering
the product until August,

25:29.928 --> 25:31.830
and we thought "Man,
romper season's over by then."

25:31.830 --> 25:32.931
So there's a season?

25:32.931 --> 25:34.700
Romper season.
I mean, we were thinking

25:34.700 --> 25:36.135
this was more
of a summer item.

25:36.135 --> 25:39.838
So we saw that
Kickstarter campaign

25:39.838 --> 25:41.907
and we pulled
some money together.

25:41.907 --> 25:44.676
We actually beat the Kickstarter
campaign to market,

25:44.676 --> 25:46.412
becoming
the first company

25:46.412 --> 25:48.313
selling these
in North America.

25:48.313 --> 25:50.249
You basically knocked
somebody else off

25:50.249 --> 25:51.884
and took over the category.
That's your claim.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.185
I wouldn't call us a knock‐off,
though,

25:53.185 --> 25:54.653

now in their romper outfits,

you sell a lot of stuff.
Yeah, exactly.

26:32.491 --> 26:33.625

26:33.625 --> 26:35.427
your customer acquisition cost
goes down.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.096

When people get their romper,
they stick it on.

What do you sell them for?

26:43.702 --> 26:44.903

4 million bucks?

the height of COVID 2020,

Right now, we're on track to do
$1.5 million this year alone.

on the $1.5 million,
