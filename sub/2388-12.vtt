WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.836
<i>With Christmas
just around the corner,</i>

00:02.920 --> 00:04.087
<i>your Uncle Barney gave me</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:06.548
<i>the horrible gift
of an unwanted secret.</i>

00:06.632 --> 00:09.927
Tomorrow night on the roof of
the World Wide News building,

00:09.927 --> 00:11.428
that's Patrice's favorite spot,

00:11.512 --> 00:12.679
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.349
Ah, poot-tu-tat!
You're jinxed.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.851
I'll unjinx you if you'll follow
these two rules:

00:17.935 --> 00:19.811
one: you can't try to talk me
out of it,

00:19.895 --> 00:24.274
and two: you can't tell anybody.
Agreed?

00:26.235 --> 00:28.028
<i>Yeah, that nod was a lie.</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:31.031
<i>You see, Robin had been hurting
over Barney all fall,</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:34.159
<i>and as her friend,
I knew I had to tell her.</i>

00:34.243 --> 00:36.870
<i>I just had to find
the right moment.</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:41.875
Uh, there he is!
The youngest architect ever

00:41.959 --> 00:44.253
to build a skyscraper
in New York City!

00:44.253 --> 00:47.339
The shockingly still
single Ted Mosby.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.423
You hear that,
ladies?

00:48.507 --> 00:51.885
I can't believe
the GNB Tower opens tonight.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.013
Ted, your building finally gets unveiled
to the whole world.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.391
You hear that, ladies?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.475
Nervous?

00:58.559 --> 01:01.103
Everything comes out of my
body in liquid form now.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.729
Ignore that, ladies.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.606
Plus, I, I keep
having this nightmare

01:04.690 --> 01:06.483
where King Kong
shows up to the opening

01:06.567 --> 01:08.110
but refuses to climb
my building

01:08.110 --> 01:11.321
because, in his words,
"It's a bit derivative."

01:11.405 --> 01:14.032
Oh, stop it, tonight
is gonna be amazing.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.326
And we are definitely gonna be
there to toast you,

01:16.410 --> 01:19.580
but we might have to leave
a little early if that's okay.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.250
My dad just gave us the most
amazing Christmas gift ever.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.669
Our first night away
since Marvin was born.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.630
24 hours straight without
that little bastard.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.009
We're maximizing
our time away

01:32.009 --> 01:34.469
by planning everything
down to the minute.

01:34.553 --> 01:35.679
See?

01:35.679 --> 01:37.431
2:12 p.m., guilt Ted

01:37.431 --> 01:40.309
into saying it's okay
if we leave early tonight.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.937
It's okay if you leave
early tonight.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.190
Look, I just appreciate you
showing up at all

01:46.190 --> 01:47.316
on your big night away.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.026
I mean, Barney's not
even gonna be there.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.528
- What?
- This is the biggest night of your career.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.280
Why isn't Barney coming?

01:55.282 --> 01:56.909
I don't know.
He said,

01:56.909 --> 02:00.370
"Legendary" and "Challenge
accepted," and then he winked.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.080
"Wait for it," you know,
all that stuff.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.874
That does sound like him.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.876
Well, we're your
real friends

02:05.876 --> 02:07.794
and we wouldn't miss
it for the world.

02:07.878 --> 02:11.757
That is why we will
see you tonight

02:11.757 --> 02:15.260
- from 7:03 to 7:14.
- Bye, guys.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.803
- Good night.
- Bye.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.765
Okay, what's the real reason
Barney's not coming?

02:19.765 --> 02:22.684
<i>Here was my chance
to tell Robin about Barney.</i>

02:24.478 --> 02:27.564
Yeah, actually, Barney didn't
say what he was doing tonight.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.360
Anyway, uh, you know, I'm not
taking anyone to the opening,

02:31.360 --> 02:34.071
so you want to be my date?

02:34.071 --> 02:35.531
Sure.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.967
Okay, Dad, I-I
made you a list

02:54.967 --> 02:57.219
of Marvin's nightly schedule
down to the minute.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.012
Okay.

02:59.096 --> 03:02.599
Uh, "9:06 p.m.,
put on edible underwear."

03:02.683 --> 03:05.269
Wrong list, wrong list.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.979
Come on, relax.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.940
I know this little guy
like the back of my hand.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.776
Dear Lord, what is that?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.113
Oh, jam, okay.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.406
Just jam.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.867
Oh, I-I forgot
the lullaby.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.034
Do you know
Marvin's lullaby?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.703
We sing it
to him every night.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.330
<i>Night, night,
little Marvin</i>

03:25.414 --> 03:27.708
<i>Stars twinkle for you</i>

03:30.711 --> 03:33.213
<i>The Dreamland train's
a-chuggin'</i>

03:34.882 --> 03:38.135
<i>All your dreams
will come true</i>

03:38.135 --> 03:40.596
<i>And the horsie
says, "Good night"</i>

03:42.890 --> 03:45.017
<i>And the birdie says
"Good night"</i>

03:47.561 --> 03:50.022
<i>And the elephant
says, "Good night"</i>

03:52.399 --> 03:54.026
<i>And the skeleton playing
his own rib cage</i>

03:54.026 --> 03:57.029
<i>Says, "Good Night"</i>

03:57.029 --> 04:00.115
<i>And the robot says
"Good night"</i>

04:01.575 --> 04:03.952
Enough with the damn music!

04:07.122 --> 04:09.833
<i>And Mr. Nesbit says "Good night"</i>

04:11.460 --> 04:14.713
<i>And the whole world says
"Good night"</i>

04:14.713 --> 04:15.923
Take it, Mommy.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.761
Got it, load him up
with cough syrup,

04:20.761 --> 04:22.679
watch <i>Breaking Bad</i>
until he conks out.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.389
Just kidding.

04:26.850 --> 04:27.851
We did it.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.353
Yeah, we did.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.771
Now that we're out the door,

04:30.771 --> 04:32.481
I actually don't feel anxious.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.608
Whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad!

04:34.608 --> 04:37.486
Oh, something horrible
happened. Aah!

04:37.486 --> 04:39.821
Oh, it's Ted, relax.

04:39.905 --> 04:40.989
Bar, now.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.034
- What is it?
- He needs me.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.620
But what about
our magical romantic night?

04:46.620 --> 04:50.123
In four minutes we're supposed
to be doing hand stuff in the cab.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.209
I'll be quick.
I'm sure it's nothing huge.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.669
That's huge.

04:53.669 --> 04:56.296
And I knew that
I had to tell Robin.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.174
- But?
- I may have, uh...

04:59.258 --> 05:01.468
asked her to be my date instead.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.136
What is wrong with me?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.221
Deep down,

05:04.221 --> 05:05.556
is there still
some crazy part of me

05:05.556 --> 05:07.558
that thinks I'm gonna
wind up with Robin?

05:07.558 --> 05:09.268
Am I that deluded?

05:09.268 --> 05:12.187
If so, I need to grow up.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.648
Oh, um, by the way,
I'm breaking a jinx swear here,

05:14.648 --> 05:16.859
so don't tell Barney
or he gets to whack me

05:16.859 --> 05:18.610
in the nuts three times
with a Wiffle ball bat.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.279
Sure, pretty standard.

05:20.279 --> 05:24.032
Robin deserves the chance to go
after Barney one last time

05:24.116 --> 05:25.784
if that's what she wants.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.035
I'm gonna go tell her.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.787
- One quick thing.
- Yeah.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.122
Don't.

05:31.582 --> 05:34.251
Hey, um, I'm gonna be
a little while, baby.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.503
It's a long story,
but Ted needs my help.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.838
Okay, but hurry

05:37.838 --> 05:41.800
or I'm gonna start doing
number 11 on my own.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.179
You can do that by yourself?

05:45.179 --> 05:46.763
Pilates, bitch.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.058
Okay, why shouldn't
I tell Robin?

05:50.142 --> 05:52.311
Because deep down
some crazy part of you

05:52.311 --> 05:55.189
still thinks you're gonna
wind up with her, and I agree.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.983
- Marshall...
- I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.110
Always have been,
always will be.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.696
Now, listen. I want my best friend
to be happy.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.157
And if Robin could mean
happiness for you,

06:05.157 --> 06:07.910
then, dear God, why help her
go after another man?

06:07.910 --> 06:10.370
Because she might still be
in love with him.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.331
To not tell her,
to not give her that chance,

06:12.331 --> 06:13.957
it's... It's selfish.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.209
So be selfish.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.293
I can't do that.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.296
Tell that to the onion rings
we just "split."

06:19.296 --> 06:21.465
Robin is my friend.

06:21.465 --> 06:24.593
She's always been more
than that and you know it.

06:24.593 --> 06:28.430
Now, as we speak, my wife
is in a hotel room cheating on me...

06:28.514 --> 06:29.556
with herself.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.724
But I'm not
leaving here

06:30.724 --> 06:33.894
until you promise not to say
a word about this to Robin.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.021
Now repeat after me. "I..."

06:36.021 --> 06:39.358
Well, I can do more
at a time than "I."

06:39.358 --> 06:42.277
"I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop

06:42.361 --> 06:44.613
putting everyone else's
interests ahead of my own,

06:44.613 --> 06:48.116
and for once in my life,
do what's best for me."

06:49.117 --> 06:50.202
I...

06:51.411 --> 06:53.747
Sorry, what was
the rest of that?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.916
Hey, Dad, just taking a break

06:55.916 --> 06:58.836
from our amazing night
to check in.

06:58.836 --> 07:03.507
I bet Marvin's pretty devastated
that I'm not there, huh?

07:03.507 --> 07:06.134
Not at all. I don't think
he even noticed you're gone.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.262
It's kind of like Mommy who?

07:08.262 --> 07:10.597
Oh. Oh, good.

07:10.681 --> 07:13.350
But I should probably sing him
his nighttime lullaby

07:13.350 --> 07:15.185
over the phone, just in case.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.563
Sang it already, nailed it.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.730
Did you do the horsie?

07:18.814 --> 07:19.982
- Yep.
- The birdie?

07:19.982 --> 07:21.233
- Yep.
- Moose.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.235
No moose, trick question.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.487
- Robot.
- Affirmative.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.613
Look, I should go.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.991
Marvin's asleep in my arms.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.577
Mmm, his head smells like love.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.370
Bye.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.836
Whoa.

07:40.836 --> 07:45.674
Hello... and
hubba-hubba.

07:45.674 --> 07:46.925
Aw, thanks.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.636
But tonight is
about my main man Mosby.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.721
Really?
Why?

07:50.721 --> 07:51.847
Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit

07:51.847 --> 07:53.515
the huge thing
that's happening tonight.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.268
Barney's getting engaged.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.189
Ranjit out.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.322
Bar-Barney's getting engaged?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.157
He asked me to keep it a secret,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.826
but I thought
you deserved to know...

08:12.910 --> 08:17.164
in case you wanted
to do something about it.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.248
Do you?

08:19.583 --> 08:20.959
Do you, Robin?

08:21.043 --> 08:22.836
Ranjit, a little
privacy, please?

08:22.920 --> 08:26.507
Sorry, not listening.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.143
Nice, uneven floor
there, Ted.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.270
Lily, are you drunk?

08:40.354 --> 08:42.606
What? I...
I'm on vacation.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.567
I may have cracked open
the minibar to celebrate.

08:45.651 --> 08:46.944
Who invited the narc?

08:46.944 --> 08:49.446
Hey, listen, I know that you
miss Marvin, but it's not

08:49.530 --> 08:51.865
like we could've brought
him to a black tie event.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.912
These parents are
so lame and-and clingy.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.456
Yeah, it's like, cut the cord
already, right, guys?

08:59.540 --> 09:01.708
Yeah, yeah,
that baby's not even cute.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.293
Super ugly baby.

09:03.377 --> 09:04.878
It's almost
physically repulsive.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.966
- Aw...
- Aw...

09:10.050 --> 09:12.719
Great, I just
started lactating.

09:12.803 --> 09:13.929
Me, too.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.599
So, what do you want to do?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.272
Robin, I do not
want to meddle,

09:23.272 --> 09:27.192
but this is like the classic
love song says...

09:31.989 --> 09:33.782
Ranjit.

09:33.866 --> 09:36.910
Ranjit, let's just communicate
via text from now on, okay?

09:40.706 --> 09:42.416
I appreciate
what you're doing.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.586
But I'm not chasing
after Barney anymore.

09:45.586 --> 09:48.547
I-I just got done being
crazy about all that.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.425
I mean, why would I want to
throw myself back in that pit?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.093
Because you're in love with him.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.428
No, I'm not.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.764
I'm happy for him.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.851
So, it doesn't bother you that
Barney Stinson's gonna propose

10:00.851 --> 10:04.229
to another woman on top of
the World Wide News building?

10:04.313 --> 10:06.231
Wait, why the top
of the World Wide News building?

10:06.315 --> 10:08.483
I guess it's Patrice's
favorite spot in the city.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.528
Damn it, Patrice, that's my
favorite spot in the city!

10:11.612 --> 10:15.240
Whoa.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.159
Ranjit says, "Whoa."

10:17.159 --> 10:18.911
Okay.

10:18.911 --> 10:23.498
Maybe that one detail stings
a little bit,

10:23.582 --> 10:26.210
but that doesn't mean
I'm in love with Barney.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.505
"Sounds like she's
in love with Barney."

10:29.505 --> 10:32.049
Okay, is this divider
even slightly soundproof?

10:32.049 --> 10:34.301
"Yes."

10:34.301 --> 10:36.678
With a little
winky face.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.640
Look, I-I hope it goes
well for Barney.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.642
I really do.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.519
But tonight there is
no place I would rather be

10:43.519 --> 10:45.103
than at your building.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.856
Celebrating with you.

10:47.940 --> 10:51.527
This kid does not mean
that you're special.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.780
It just means that you're
horny and you're easy.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.740
Now, come on,
let me smell his head.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.744
Oh, Li-Lily, Lily,
no, no, no, no, come on.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.539
Seriously, Ted,
what is up with the floor?

11:04.957 --> 11:06.375
- Lily.
- What?

11:06.375 --> 11:07.459
Is it harder
than we thought

11:07.543 --> 11:09.378
to be away from
Marvin? Yes.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.713
But are we gonna have fun
or are we gonna wallow

11:11.797 --> 11:13.215
in the corner like idiots?

11:13.215 --> 11:16.218
<i>Night, night, little Marvin</i>

11:16.218 --> 11:19.513
<i>Stars twinkle for you</i>

11:21.098 --> 11:24.226
<i>The Dreamland train's
a-chuggin'</i>

11:25.310 --> 11:26.645
<i>All your dreams</i>

11:26.645 --> 11:29.982
<i>Will come true</i>

11:32.150 --> 11:33.569
Hey.

11:33.569 --> 11:37.656
Do you realize that something
you thought up in your head

11:37.656 --> 11:42.119
now exists as a part
of the Manhattan skyline?

11:42.119 --> 11:44.079
That's huge.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.248
It's just a building.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.250
I mean, I'm incredibly young
for such an achievement,

11:48.250 --> 11:50.419
but it's just a building.

11:50.419 --> 11:51.712
I mean,
<i>Architecture Vision Weekly</i>

11:51.712 --> 11:53.630
may have dubbed it
"more than just a building,"

11:53.714 --> 11:54.882
but it's just a building.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.300
So let's not get carried...

11:56.300 --> 11:57.801
Okay, you're right, it's huge.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.178
It is huge.

11:59.178 --> 12:01.013
You're the star of the party,
and who knows?

12:01.013 --> 12:03.724
Maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby
is gonna be there.

12:06.977 --> 12:10.355
Yeah, maybe she will.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.984
Oh.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.068
Wait, this isn't your...

12:18.906 --> 12:20.532
This is
the World Wide News building.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.452
Go get him.

12:28.207 --> 12:31.251
I told you,
I am done chasing Barney.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.754
Now can we please go
to your party?

12:33.754 --> 12:36.256
Robin, do you want to spend
tonight making small talk

12:36.340 --> 12:37.799
with a bunch of bankers

12:37.883 --> 12:40.552
in a daring yet refined
contemporary masterpiece

12:40.636 --> 12:43.722
King Kong should feel lucky
to climb...

12:43.722 --> 12:46.517
or do you
want to follow your heart?

12:46.517 --> 12:48.727
Why do you keep insisting that
I have feelings for Barney?

12:48.727 --> 12:51.104
Because you do.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.774
See, even Ranjit agrees.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.652
Oh, he's got to pee.

12:56.652 --> 12:57.778
The point is,

12:57.778 --> 12:58.862
you're not over Barney.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.614
That's why you freaked out
about him proposing

13:00.614 --> 13:02.533
on the roof
of the World Wide News building.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.035
I did not freak out.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.328
It's just...

13:06.328 --> 13:09.498
a teeny, tiny bit annoying

13:09.498 --> 13:11.124
that I am the one

13:11.208 --> 13:13.210
who showed her that roof
in the first place!

13:13.210 --> 13:14.878
Damn it, Patrice!

13:14.962 --> 13:16.088
Whoa.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.259
"Never mind; I found
a soda bottle."

13:20.259 --> 13:22.094
Okay, that's disturbing.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.971
What do you want me
to do, Ted?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.055
Run up to that roof,

13:25.055 --> 13:26.890
knock the ring
out of Barney's hand,

13:26.974 --> 13:30.310
and say, "Sorry to interrupt,
but you should be with me"?

13:32.437 --> 13:34.106
Is that what you want?

13:34.106 --> 13:36.525
No.

13:36.525 --> 13:37.860
I don't.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.949
I can't keep making
an ass of myself.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.244
Well,

13:47.244 --> 13:49.788
a word in defense of making
an ass of yourself,

13:49.872 --> 13:51.123
it's underrated.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.543
Eight years ago...

13:54.543 --> 13:56.628
I made an ass
of myself chasing after you,

13:56.712 --> 13:59.173
and I've made an ass
of myself chasing after you

13:59.173 --> 14:00.549
a bunch of times since then.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.302
But I have no regrets.

14:04.928 --> 14:05.929
Because it led me to something

14:06.013 --> 14:07.306
that I wouldn't trade
for the world.

14:07.306 --> 14:10.976
It led to you being my friend.

14:12.561 --> 14:13.937
So, as your friend

14:15.272 --> 14:17.191
and a leading expert
in the field

14:17.191 --> 14:19.443
of making an ass of yourself,

14:19.443 --> 14:20.903
I say to you...

14:22.196 --> 14:23.906
from the heart,

14:25.240 --> 14:27.159
get the hell out of this car.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.707
But, Ted,

14:35.334 --> 14:36.627
your big night.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.382
It's just a building.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.754
<i>The Robin.</i>

15:23.257 --> 15:24.925
<i>Step one: admit to yourself</i>

15:24.925 --> 15:26.969
<i>that you still have feelings
for this girl.</i>

15:26.969 --> 15:30.597
I am hopelessly,
irretrievably in love with her.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.851
More than she knows.

15:33.851 --> 15:34.935
<i>Step two:</i>

15:34.935 --> 15:37.896
<i>choose the completely wrong
moment to make a drunken move</i>

15:37.980 --> 15:39.815
<i>after hanging out
at a strip club...</i>

15:42.067 --> 15:44.278
<i>and get shot down on purpose.</i>

15:46.864 --> 15:47.865
<i>Step three:</i>

15:47.865 --> 15:50.617
<i>agree that you two don't work,
locking the door</i>

15:50.701 --> 15:52.202
<i>on any future
you could have together.</i>

15:52.286 --> 15:54.538
I'm done trying to get you.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.415
I can't do it anymore.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.709
<i>Which will drive Robin nuts.</i>

15:58.709 --> 15:59.793
Huh.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.504
<i>Step four:</i>

16:02.588 --> 16:04.381
<i>Robin goes nuts.</i>

16:05.632 --> 16:06.633
<i>Step five:</i>

16:06.717 --> 16:08.719
<i>find the person
who annoys Robin most</i>

16:08.719 --> 16:09.928
<i>in the world...</i>

16:10.012 --> 16:12.848
Nobody asked
for your help, Patrice!

16:14.099 --> 16:16.101
<i>...and ask for her help.</i>

16:17.311 --> 16:18.353
Oh, hi, Barney.

16:18.437 --> 16:19.688
What are you doing here?

16:19.688 --> 16:22.065
Actually, I'm looking for you.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.109
This may sound kind of weird,
but I have a proposition...

16:24.193 --> 16:25.777
<i>Explain everything to Patrice</i>

16:25.861 --> 16:27.446
<i>and hope she agrees to help.</i>

16:27.446 --> 16:29.489
Yay. I love Robin.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.992
Of course I'll help.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.327
Good, good.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.204
<i>Step six:
check with your doctor</i>

16:35.204 --> 16:37.706
<i>about possible broken ribs.</i>

16:37.706 --> 16:40.751
<i>Step seven:
pretend to be dating Patrice.</i>

16:40.751 --> 16:43.253
Nobody asked you here,
Patrice!

16:44.796 --> 16:46.590
Actually, I did.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.674
<i>Step eight:</i>

16:47.758 --> 16:49.927
<i>wait until Robin inevitably
breaks into your place</i>

16:49.927 --> 16:52.262
<i>to find the Playbook
and show it to Patrice,</i>

16:52.346 --> 16:54.097
<i>which you'll monitor
via the hidden cameras</i>

16:54.181 --> 16:55.641
<i>you have in your apartment.</i>

16:59.561 --> 17:01.980
Patrice, the robin's
in the nest.

17:03.482 --> 17:06.068
That means Robin broke
into my apartment

17:06.068 --> 17:08.362
Were you even listening
when I explained the codes?

17:08.362 --> 17:11.156
<i>Step nine: after Patrice
finds the Playbook,</i>

17:11.240 --> 17:13.492
<i>have your first big fight.</i>

17:13.492 --> 17:15.786
This is going so well.
Thank you so much.

17:15.786 --> 17:18.247
I know, but what the heck
are Lily and Ted doing here?

17:18.247 --> 17:20.499
I don't know.
My friends have no boundaries.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.459
How can I ever thank you?

17:22.543 --> 17:24.419
Oh, will you watch my
cat next weekend?

17:24.503 --> 17:26.004
No.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.590
Come on, we should probably
go back inside.

17:28.674 --> 17:29.925
<i>Step ten:</i>

17:29.925 --> 17:31.301
<i>prove your loyalty to Patrice</i>

17:31.385 --> 17:33.303
<i>by burning the Playbook,</i>

17:33.387 --> 17:35.055
<i>and actually burn it.</i>

17:37.140 --> 17:38.684
<i>You don't need it anymore.</i>

17:40.978 --> 17:42.312
<i>Step 11:</i>

17:42.396 --> 17:44.314
<i>because your friends
have no boundaries,</i>

17:44.398 --> 17:46.817
<i>they'll inevitably have
an intervention for Robin,</i>

17:46.817 --> 17:48.527
<i>which you'll monitor
via the hidden cameras</i>

17:48.527 --> 17:51.196
<i>you have in Marshall
and Lily's apartment.</i>

17:51.280 --> 17:52.281
<i>Step 12:</i>

17:52.281 --> 17:53.740
<i>tell only Ted about your plan</i>

17:53.824 --> 17:55.158
<i>to propose to Patrice.</i>

17:55.242 --> 17:57.661
You can't tell anybody.

17:57.661 --> 17:58.912
Agreed?

18:00.998 --> 18:02.040
<i>Step 13:</i>

18:02.124 --> 18:04.168
<i>wait and see
if Ted tells Robin,</i>

18:04.168 --> 18:05.294
<i>and if he does...</i>

18:05.294 --> 18:06.920
Barney's getting engaged.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.006
<i>...it means your best bro
in the world</i>

18:09.006 --> 18:12.676
<i>has let go of Robin
and has given you his blessing.</i>

18:12.676 --> 18:14.970
<i>Step 14:
Robin arrives</i>

18:14.970 --> 18:16.847
<i>at her favorite spot
in the city</i>

18:16.847 --> 18:19.266
<i>and finds the secret final page</i>

18:19.266 --> 18:21.185
<i>of the Playbook.</i>

18:21.185 --> 18:22.436
<i>The last play</i>

18:22.436 --> 18:24.396
<i>you'll ever run.</i>

18:24.396 --> 18:26.857
<i>Step 15: Robin realizes</i>

18:26.857 --> 18:29.109
<i>she's standing
underneath mistletoe.</i>

18:39.328 --> 18:41.330
Seriously, Barney?

18:41.330 --> 18:42.789
Even you,

18:42.873 --> 18:46.335
even someone
as certifiably insane as you

18:46.335 --> 18:48.462
must realize
that this is too far.

18:49.713 --> 18:51.256
You lied to me,

18:51.340 --> 18:53.342
manipulated me for weeks.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.802
Do you really think I could
ever kiss you after that?

18:55.886 --> 18:56.887
Do you really think

18:56.887 --> 18:59.848
I could ever trust you
after that?

18:59.932 --> 19:00.933
This...

19:00.933 --> 19:02.768
this is proof
of why we don't work,

19:02.768 --> 19:05.437
why we'll never work.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.022
So thank you.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.982
You've set me free because...

19:09.066 --> 19:12.194
how could I be with a man
who thinks that this...

19:12.194 --> 19:14.780
trick, this enormous lie

19:14.780 --> 19:17.199
could ever make me want
to date him again?

19:19.034 --> 19:20.994
Turn it over.

19:29.378 --> 19:30.629
Robin Scherbatsky...

19:32.756 --> 19:34.258
will you marry me?

19:40.681 --> 19:41.682
Yes.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.520
<i>In the oceans deep</i>

19:46.520 --> 19:50.107
<i>In the canyons steep</i>

19:50.107 --> 19:52.901
<i>Walls of granite</i>

19:52.985 --> 19:55.571
<i>Here I stand</i>

19:57.364 --> 20:00.868
<i>All my desperate calls</i>

20:00.868 --> 20:04.454
<i>Echo off the walls</i>

20:04.538 --> 20:05.998
<i>Back and forth...</i>

20:05.998 --> 20:09.293
And so, let's all raise a glass
to Ted Mosby.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.377
None of this

20:10.377 --> 20:12.671
would have been possible
without him.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.174
To Ted.
To Ted.

20:15.174 --> 20:22.806
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

20:22.890 --> 20:24.975
<i>Oh-oh</i>

20:26.018 --> 20:28.687
<i>To believe</i>

20:28.687 --> 20:32.399
<i>I walk</i>

20:32.399 --> 20:35.319
<i>Alone</i>

20:40.449 --> 20:43.035
<i>Is a lie</i>

20:43.035 --> 20:46.413
<i>That I've</i>

20:46.413 --> 20:49.541
<i>Been told</i>

20:50.959 --> 20:54.505
<i>So let your heart hold fast</i>

20:54.505 --> 20:58.258
<i>For this soon shall pass</i>

20:58.342 --> 21:03.639
<i>There's another hill ahead</i>
