ACTUALLY, THERE'S BEEN
SOME NEW INTEL

10:05.138 --> 10:08.341
THAT'S NARROWED OUR SEARCH
TO FLOORS 33 THROUGH 61.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.143
THAT MAKES 28 FLOORS
INSTEAD OF 103.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.411
GREAT.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.113
WHICH IS GOOD --
THIS IS AN ICONIC BUILDING,

10:13.146 --> 10:14.782
AND IT WILL REMAIN OPEN
DURING OUR SEARCH.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.949
THE WARRANT
GIVES US TWO DAYS.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.585
THAT MEANS WE NEED TO
CLEAR A FLOOR EVERY TWO HOURS.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.453
CORRECT. WE WILL
WORK SYSTEMATICALLY.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.489
