WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.958
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:19.375 --> 01:20.375
Looking for me?

01:27.708 --> 01:32.375
I know we got off to a bad start,
but believe me, I'm on your side.

01:37.666 --> 01:39.541
This town is like Babylon.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.958
It's always been a haunt for demons.

01:43.041 --> 01:43.875
You like it?

01:46.541 --> 01:47.791
It's an original.

01:49.416 --> 01:50.541
It dates back to--

03:12.083 --> 03:13.083
Sofía?

03:17.666 --> 03:18.583
Halid!

03:19.083 --> 03:20.750
What are you doing out of your room?

03:22.416 --> 03:24.000
-Halid.
-Your mother is fine.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.000
-I'm speaking to you.
-Look for Mani.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.583
The police called.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.000
-They want to talk to you.
-Okay.

04:22.250 --> 04:25.041
I am the first and the last.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.416
The honorable and the despicable.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.750
The prostitute and the virtuous.

04:29.833 --> 04:32.041
The wife and the virgin.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.958
The mother and the daughter.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.541
I am the one they call life,

04:36.625 --> 04:39.083
and you have called me death.

04:39.583 --> 04:44.791
I, who have been sent from the power
and have come to those who think of me

04:44.875 --> 04:47.541
and have been found
in those who search for me.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.583
Accept me by your side.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.750
I am the first and the last.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.666
The honorable and the despicable.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.000
The prostitute and the virtuous.

04:56.083 --> 04:59.208
The wife and the virgin.
The mother and the daughter.

04:59.291 --> 05:03.875
I am the one they call life,
and you have called me death.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.166
It's only a couple of frames.
I hadn't noticed her until now.

05:12.250 --> 05:16.208
We found 23 bodies at the mine,
but 24 people came out.

05:16.708 --> 05:18.250
She's still missing.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.250
I have no idea who she is.

05:22.791 --> 05:25.333
There were so many people
when I got there.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.791
Do you see your brother there?

05:45.708 --> 05:46.708
Goran.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.333
What will happen with his body?

05:50.833 --> 05:54.041
In a few days,
when they finish with the autopsies,

05:54.583 --> 05:56.208
we can try to get him repatriated.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.750
-Do you want him to be buried there?
-No.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.333
He'll be better off here.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.708
In the Feria cemetery.

06:05.916 --> 06:07.500
You're staying in town?

06:08.166 --> 06:09.416
Do I have to leave?

06:09.500 --> 06:10.541
I want you close by,

06:10.625 --> 06:12.458
in case you remember something.

06:13.041 --> 06:16.125
The shelter is for minors,
so you can't stay there.

06:16.916 --> 06:17.916
All right.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.458
Find a place to rent.

06:21.958 --> 06:24.833
Check in with me every now and again
so I know how you're doing.

06:24.916 --> 06:27.250
You'll have to get yourself a job.

06:27.958 --> 06:30.500
I'm supposed to notify immigration.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.958
But if I do, you won't be able to stay.

06:37.416 --> 06:38.416
Thanks.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.333
Toss me the cable!

06:48.833 --> 06:51.125
Hey, kid! What channel's this gonna be on?

06:51.208 --> 06:53.041
I wanna be on TV too.

06:58.708 --> 07:02.083
ANA SÁNCHEZ
WITH YOU

07:02.166 --> 07:03.916
<i>The small town of Feria</i>

07:04.000 --> 07:07.583
<i>will need time to get over this tragedy.</i>

07:07.666 --> 07:11.208
<i>The Civil Guard suspects</i>
<i>it was a mass suicide</i>

07:11.291 --> 07:15.416
<i>led by a group known as the Cult of Light.</i>

07:15.500 --> 07:18.958
<i>Sadly, this is not a new phenomenon.</i>

07:19.041 --> 07:22.541
<i>We haven't forgotten</i>
<i>the deaths of 48 people</i>

07:22.625 --> 07:25.625
<i>in the Swiss towns of Cheiry and Salvan</i>

07:25.708 --> 07:28.458
<i>as part of a ritual</i>
<i>performed by the Solar Temple cult.</i>

07:28.541 --> 07:31.583
-<i>Or the more than 80 victims…</i>
-This should never have happened here.

07:31.666 --> 07:34.583
It could have happened anywhere.

07:34.666 --> 07:37.916
<i>Just like in those cases,</i>
<i>what happened in Feria</i>

07:38.000 --> 07:40.250
<i>was the work of cult leaders,</i>

07:40.333 --> 07:43.750
<i>responsible for the deaths</i>
<i>of these 23 people.</i>

07:43.833 --> 07:47.500
<i>The police are focusing their efforts</i>
<i>on locating those two individuals,</i>

07:47.583 --> 07:50.333
<i>Elena Vera and Pablo Soto.</i> <i>A teacher…</i>

07:50.416 --> 07:52.291
They must have been weirdos.

07:53.791 --> 07:55.000
Did you know them?

07:56.125 --> 07:57.291
What about the daughters?

07:57.375 --> 07:59.041
They should do an interview.

07:59.791 --> 08:01.583
Or are they as crazy as their parents?

08:02.458 --> 08:05.750
Raúl, why don't you see
if the deliveryman is here yet?

08:05.833 --> 08:07.666
<i>…our reporter Raquel Llamas.</i>

08:07.750 --> 08:09.916
<i>How are things there?</i>

08:10.000 --> 08:13.833
Good morning, Ana.
The general feeling is one of shock.

08:13.916 --> 08:17.500
Elena Vera and Pablo Soto have called
this town home for many years.

08:17.583 --> 08:18.791
But from what we've heard,

08:18.875 --> 08:21.458
they rarely participated
in town functions.

08:21.541 --> 08:25.375
-Who told them that? Your mom?
-They pay good money.

08:25.458 --> 08:29.166
Petra got 5,000 pesetas
for a high school photo of her and Sofía.

08:31.666 --> 08:32.500
Where are you going?

08:33.083 --> 08:34.916
One of them is a minor.

08:35.416 --> 08:38.833
The older one is named Eva Soto.

08:38.916 --> 08:42.041
She had just started her modeling career.

08:42.125 --> 08:45.541
<i>As you can see, folks here</i>
<i>wanted to make their voices heard.</i>

08:50.083 --> 08:51.500
<i>We're live, you brat.</i>

08:52.708 --> 08:57.416
<i>The locals clearly want</i>
<i>to distance themselves from this family.</i>

08:57.958 --> 09:01.125
<i>Thank you, Raquel,</i>
<i>for capturing the general feeling</i>

09:01.208 --> 09:04.750
<i>of a town that is still unsure</i>
<i>whether this is all a bad dream.</i>

09:05.625 --> 09:06.708
You're not hungry?

09:06.791 --> 09:10.166
<i>…just tuning in, 23 bodies have been found</i>

09:10.250 --> 09:12.041
<i>at the abandoned mine in Feria.</i>

09:12.125 --> 09:14.291
<i>The Civil Guard has closed the area…</i>

09:14.375 --> 09:17.916
I don't need to tell you
you're acting like a spoiled brat, right?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.125
You know you are.

09:21.375 --> 09:22.750
I'm going to talk to Estrella.

09:23.291 --> 09:26.041
How could they let
that nutcase from the mine near you?

09:26.125 --> 09:27.166
What are you gonna do?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.083
Have me sent to Seville?

09:29.166 --> 09:31.500
Do you actually think
Mani knows how Mom's doing?

09:32.000 --> 09:32.916
He's a dealer.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.500
I'm gonna talk to him.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.250
And I'm not leaving town.

09:39.416 --> 09:40.541
Give me that.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.083
Let go.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.291
Look, whatever Mom
and Dad were involved in,

09:48.208 --> 09:49.958
I won't let you make the same mistake.

09:50.458 --> 09:53.333
Sofía, sit down.
I'm talking to you, dammit!

09:57.208 --> 09:59.458
Eva, someone's here to see you.

10:02.416 --> 10:05.458
Tomorrow night at eight o'clock,
they'll be gathering in the square.

10:06.916 --> 10:12.166
My mother and everyone don't want
people thinking they're with the cult.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.875
They've arranged for a minute of silence.

10:15.958 --> 10:18.125
Like I want to be considered
part of the cult?

10:21.500 --> 10:23.333
It might be a good idea if you came.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.625
Have you seen Raúl?

10:34.708 --> 10:36.583
His dad's with the cops from out of town.

10:38.375 --> 10:40.833
I guess he doesn't want
Raúl to be grilled.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.625
As if Raúl knows anything.

10:45.041 --> 10:48.125
If you talk to him, tell him I'm sorry.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.375
I didn't mean for it to happen.

10:51.416 --> 10:53.875
It was dumb, and you were drunk.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.083
Eva, you're not alone.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.916
This must suck.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.375
Yeah, it sucks.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.458
Tell Raúl to come see me.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.375
I miss him.

11:23.625 --> 11:26.875
The church has been closed all morning.
It's strange.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.625
Don't worry. It's probably nothing.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.125
After you.

11:39.458 --> 11:40.625
Ezcaray?

11:43.458 --> 11:44.500
Father!

11:45.708 --> 11:48.208
Maybe he had too much altar wine.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.000
Wouldn't be the first time.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.333
No way. He has to prepare the homily
for tomorrow's minute of silence.

11:53.833 --> 11:57.416
I told him I'd come to help at eight,
but the church was closed.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.541
-All right.
-It's odd. It's noon now.

11:59.625 --> 12:02.333
Don't worry, Candela.
I'll check out the sacristy.

12:02.416 --> 12:03.791
Ezcaray!

12:11.541 --> 12:12.708
Father?

12:28.291 --> 12:30.208
-No!
-Candela!

12:30.291 --> 12:34.916
-He's dead! Oh God! He's dead!
-Get her out of here!

12:35.000 --> 12:36.125
Let's go.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.500
And call Lieutenant Guillén!

13:38.625 --> 13:41.958
-When is forensics getting here?
-Half an hour or so.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.583
I called the judge too.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.500
Fucking perfect.

14:03.958 --> 14:05.416
I want you going house to house.

14:05.500 --> 14:09.291
Find out if anyone saw or heard anything
last night, after one o'clock.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.250
He's been dead about ten hours.

14:11.833 --> 14:15.291
It looks like a robbery,
but with everything going on, I doubt it.

14:15.791 --> 14:18.833
-Corporal Iruña, head of the caving team.
-About time.

14:18.916 --> 14:20.500
What hole did you crawl out of?

14:21.666 --> 14:23.875
First thing tomorrow
we'll head into the mine.

14:23.958 --> 14:25.750
As soon as we can secure the descent.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.750
Sir, there are people here to see you.

14:28.375 --> 14:29.833
Families of the victims.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.291
Mani?

14:59.208 --> 15:00.208
Hey.

15:02.625 --> 15:03.916
So, Halid talked to you.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.166
Eh, princess?

15:05.666 --> 15:06.791
Who's Halid?

15:08.166 --> 15:09.208
The guy from the mine?

15:11.500 --> 15:12.791
Aren't you curious?

15:13.416 --> 15:14.500
What do you know?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.250
Not much, princess.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.833
But I watch and learn.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.416
Where is my mother?

15:27.416 --> 15:28.875
You gotta put this on.

15:31.333 --> 15:32.250
<i>She</i> asked me to.

15:37.291 --> 15:39.833
Relax, nothing bad will happen to you.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.000
-Halid.
-Yes?

16:27.750 --> 16:29.708
Why don't you get her a seat?

16:33.916 --> 16:36.000
It's all right.

16:45.750 --> 16:46.833
Where am I?

16:47.333 --> 16:49.041
I know this is odd.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.583
But they've forced us into hiding.

16:52.958 --> 16:55.500
Don't we have anything to offer our guest?

16:55.583 --> 16:58.291
Even if it's just a glass of water, Mani.

17:08.541 --> 17:09.500
<i>We saw you leave.</i>

17:10.166 --> 17:13.250
You and your sister.
Going to the Saint John's Eve bonfires.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.333
Elena didn't want you to be there.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.833
"Each one in their due time."
That's what she said.

17:18.916 --> 17:22.166
Except you know this is all a show.
Right, Sofía?

17:29.375 --> 17:30.666
Where is my mother?

17:31.416 --> 17:32.666
What did you do to her?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.166
Everything she asked of us.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.083
Open your eyes.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.708
The truth is calling out to you.
Or am I wrong?

17:43.208 --> 17:47.000
The cave is the path to the light.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.375
This is a botched, unfinished job,

17:49.458 --> 17:52.666
but you have to know
how to find the mistakes.

17:54.375 --> 17:57.041
Snowflake, show her the puzzle.

18:00.041 --> 18:01.541
You'll see.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.166
They look identical.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.583
Only they are not.

18:06.666 --> 18:09.625
One of them is a bad copy.

18:16.208 --> 18:17.541
Can you spot the difference?

18:18.041 --> 18:18.875
Can you?

18:20.416 --> 18:22.041
What are you talking about?

18:22.125 --> 18:24.208
If you know
something about my mother, tell me.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.250
Elena is in the kingdom.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.875
This is what's going to happen.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.833
They will go into the mine.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.541
They'll search the galleries,
but they won't find anything.

18:52.916 --> 18:55.125
Because Elena is no longer there.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.333
Then where is she?

18:59.125 --> 19:00.375
You want to be with her?

19:04.208 --> 19:05.416
Look at me.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.083
My body is a grave.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.041
Is this all that I am?

19:09.125 --> 19:11.541
Lifeless, rotting legs?

19:12.041 --> 19:14.875
-No, this is a mistake.
-There is more than this.

19:14.958 --> 19:17.708
You need to wake up,
just as Elena woke us up.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.041
We speak the truth.

19:19.125 --> 19:22.708
The others will turn their backs on you.
But not us.

19:24.416 --> 19:27.458
-But not us.
-You have forgotten too many things.

19:28.416 --> 19:30.458
But I can help you remember.

19:31.666 --> 19:34.208
I can bring you to your mother.

19:36.666 --> 19:38.250
This is fucking insane!

19:43.416 --> 19:44.458
What do you want?

19:46.166 --> 19:47.750
To kill me like the others?

19:55.041 --> 19:56.041
Death.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.083
Pain.

20:04.750 --> 20:05.750
Anger.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.333
They do not exist, Sofía.

20:14.166 --> 20:17.416
Just like the walls that surround us.

20:20.666 --> 20:23.166
We aren't the ones that will hurt you.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.166
Let her go.

20:34.541 --> 20:35.750
Let her think.

20:41.166 --> 20:42.666
You'll be back.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.250
What is that?

20:47.333 --> 20:50.125
-Relax.
-No!

21:01.500 --> 21:03.958
There's no sign
of Pablo Soto or that woman.

21:04.041 --> 21:06.291
The one who survived the mine.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.833
This town is starting to look
like one big black hole.

21:08.916 --> 21:09.916
Thanks.

21:10.875 --> 21:13.708
-Can you keep a secret?
-What is it?

21:15.083 --> 21:19.333
I don't know how a black hole works.
I've heard them explain it so many times.

21:19.416 --> 21:22.416
I pretend to understand,
but I'm not that smart.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.458
Soon as I'm feeling better,
I'll try to help you get it.

21:25.541 --> 21:28.083
You always were the smart one.
You have to come back.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.625
I need someone
to keep me from making an ass of myself.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.250
Maybe I should quit bugging you
and let you sleep.

21:37.291 --> 21:38.833
Why don't you go back to Madrid?

21:39.333 --> 21:41.333
You need to see a doctor.
This isn't the flu.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.666
I don't want to leave you alone.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.583
I only said it to make you feel guilty.

21:48.125 --> 21:51.250
As soon as I find Pablo, this is over.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.416
I'll rough him up

21:52.500 --> 21:55.583
until he tells me how they convinced
those people to off themselves.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.375
Might even pin
that priest's murder on him.

21:59.833 --> 22:00.875
What priest?

22:03.166 --> 22:04.250
Father Ezcaray.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.958
Found him dead in the church this morning.

22:07.791 --> 22:08.625
Place was trashed.

22:08.708 --> 22:12.625
I don't know, maybe someone tried
to rob the place, busted his head open.

22:19.458 --> 22:20.333
Guillén.

22:21.458 --> 22:22.500
What?

22:23.958 --> 22:25.875
Tomorrow, when you go to the mine…

22:26.958 --> 22:27.958
What is it?

22:30.000 --> 22:30.833
Be careful.

22:32.666 --> 22:33.541
Get some rest.

23:04.541 --> 23:05.750
Sofía!

23:11.333 --> 23:12.375
Where were you?

23:13.416 --> 23:15.000
I was scared to death.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.833
Nobody is buying your story
about slipping and falling in the rain.

23:25.541 --> 23:26.708
Did you go to see Mani?

23:28.000 --> 23:28.916
I told you.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.666
I went for a walk and I slipped.

23:33.750 --> 23:35.375
Guillén is letting us go back home.

23:35.458 --> 23:38.708
But if you don't want this
to be a living hell, you can't lie to me.

23:38.791 --> 23:40.125
I'm not, Eva.

23:43.791 --> 23:45.791
Did you tell the Civil Guard everything?

23:47.500 --> 23:49.500
What the kid from the mine told me?

23:51.291 --> 23:53.208
If I do, you're going straight to Seville.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.541
Don't make me regret it.

24:01.666 --> 24:05.291
The officers who are going
into the mine arrived today.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.083
They're gonna search it tomorrow.

24:12.166 --> 24:13.750
Do you know what that means?

24:17.625 --> 24:19.375
I'm pretty sure Mom's in there.

24:26.125 --> 24:27.583
Are you listening?

24:29.541 --> 24:31.958
Stop pretending they're coming back.
They aren't.

24:33.458 --> 24:34.875
Goddammit, Sofía.

24:37.541 --> 24:38.541
Sofía!

25:08.416 --> 25:10.458
CIVIL GUARD

26:28.625 --> 26:29.541
EVIDENCE

26:29.625 --> 26:30.958
They didn't find her.

26:31.666 --> 26:34.666
She was in the mine,
but there was no body.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.125
They will go into the mine.

26:36.208 --> 26:39.375
<i>They'll search the galleries,</i>
<i>but they won't find anything.</i>

26:39.458 --> 26:40.791
<i>Elena is no longer there.</i>

26:40.875 --> 26:45.250
The methane gas levels are too high.
There's no way she could've survived.

26:46.041 --> 26:47.375
Does no one care?

26:51.750 --> 26:54.666
We've got a chopper
doing sweeps of the forest,

26:55.166 --> 26:57.125
but we can't see anything from the air.

26:57.208 --> 26:59.458
We'll send out a team
on foot as soon as we can.

26:59.958 --> 27:03.083
Do you have any idea
where your father could be?

27:03.166 --> 27:05.916
Some place he might have told you about?

27:08.125 --> 27:09.625
He didn't like the forest.

27:09.708 --> 27:12.541
He wouldn't come with me
to look for bugs for my chameleon.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.416
Do you recognize this woman?

27:19.708 --> 27:20.541
No.

27:20.625 --> 27:24.250
Girls, I've done everything you've asked.
Letting you stay in Feria together.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.041
Any other cop would've separated you.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.500
You're at home.

27:27.583 --> 27:30.958
I've got officers protecting you,
and it's not like I have men to spare.

27:31.041 --> 27:32.916
You have to give me something in return.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.666
I've never seen that woman before.

27:39.875 --> 27:40.833
They should come out.

27:42.375 --> 27:45.125
Sofía, in a few days, they'll be gone.

27:45.916 --> 27:47.458
They owe us an explanation.

27:49.666 --> 27:50.541
Come out!

27:52.458 --> 27:53.875
What's going on out there?

27:53.958 --> 27:54.916
No, Eva.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.666
-What are they saying?
-Eva.

28:00.208 --> 28:01.916
We don't know anything.

28:02.416 --> 28:04.291
We're helping the Civil Guard.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.416
Did anyone tell them that?

28:07.916 --> 28:10.166
What do I have to do to prove I care?

28:14.458 --> 28:17.208
It's normal for Eva
to want to stop hiding.

28:17.291 --> 28:20.250
It's obvious what's going to happen
during that minute of silence.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.666
If you're so sure, assign her an officer.

28:22.750 --> 28:25.208
The lonelier she gets,
the more she'll help us.

28:25.291 --> 28:28.000
I know it's shitty,
but I'm out of options.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.291
Lieutenant.

28:29.375 --> 28:33.291
Officer Séller spoke
with a neighbor, Josefina Melo.

28:33.375 --> 28:36.958
She saw someone in the square
the other night, while she was watering.

28:37.041 --> 28:38.375
Can she make an ID?

28:38.916 --> 28:41.250
If not, try to get a composite sketch.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.958
-Is that about Ezcaray?
-Nine skull fractures.

28:45.041 --> 28:48.750
This wasn't some thief trying to get away.
Someone did this out of rage.

28:48.833 --> 28:52.541
-I've asked around. He had no enemies.
-Didn't have many friends either.

28:52.625 --> 28:54.458
Who'd want to go drinking with a priest

28:54.541 --> 28:57.833
who says you'll go to hell
if you don't receive Communion every week?

28:57.916 --> 28:58.750
He was one of those?

28:59.375 --> 29:01.000
I guess there's not much difference

29:01.083 --> 29:03.625
between a priest and the people
who went into that mine.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.750
Actually, maybe that's not fair.

29:06.458 --> 29:09.041
He used to visit the kids at the shelter.

29:09.125 --> 29:11.916
As if staying on good terms
with God was their only issue.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.208
Saving lost souls.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.250
Talk to Mani.

29:18.166 --> 29:21.583
He spent a few years at the shelter.
Not that Ezcaray had success with him.

29:21.666 --> 29:23.666
He's the local drug pusher.

29:24.291 --> 29:26.375
But they were still in touch.

29:28.458 --> 29:29.541
Let me bum a drag?

29:32.125 --> 29:34.208
-So?
-So what?

29:34.708 --> 29:37.250
Are you gonna put someone
with Eva so she can go tonight?

29:37.916 --> 29:41.916
We thought the tragedies
you see on TV happened to other people.

29:43.416 --> 29:46.125
But we've been shown that isn't the case.

29:47.291 --> 29:48.541
Our town…

29:48.625 --> 29:50.416
FERIA STANDS WITH THE VICTIMS

29:50.458 --> 29:54.625
…is where 23 innocent victims
met their fate.

29:54.708 --> 29:55.916
Twenty-four,

29:56.833 --> 29:59.291
if we count Father Ezcaray.

29:59.791 --> 30:03.875
He should be the one here
comforting us with his words.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.208
Chisco!

30:24.166 --> 30:25.333
They don't want me alone.

30:28.250 --> 30:29.458
I stopped by your store.

30:33.541 --> 30:34.916
I'm sorry about your mother.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.916
I'm really so sorry, Chisco.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.416
-I'll leave you two alone.
-Wait. I'm coming.

30:40.125 --> 30:43.750
-We're gonna be late to the memorial.
-Chisco, please don't do this to me.

30:43.833 --> 30:45.166
Please. I'm a wreck.

30:45.250 --> 30:47.958
-You're the only one I can talk to.
-About what?

31:05.291 --> 31:07.750
Get lost. I don't want anything
to do with you.

31:11.083 --> 31:12.833
You are the one who matters.

31:12.916 --> 31:14.625
That's what Elena said.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.625
Stop talking about my mother
like you knew her.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.208
You two are so alike.

31:19.291 --> 31:20.958
Why don't you call the cops over?

31:21.500 --> 31:24.958
Because deep down
you know we have the truth.

31:25.833 --> 31:26.791
Come on, Sofía.

31:27.291 --> 31:28.666
Elena is waiting for you.

31:29.458 --> 31:30.583
Your mother.

31:36.125 --> 31:38.666
I want to ask you to close your eyes.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.166
And look for God inside.

31:41.250 --> 31:44.208
Because when we turn our backs on Him,
we become easy prey

31:44.291 --> 31:49.500
to those who would take advantage
of our weakness, like the Cult of Light.

32:01.833 --> 32:03.125
Thank you, Lozano.

32:03.666 --> 32:07.500
And now I would like to ask
for a minute of silence

32:07.583 --> 32:09.375
in memory of the victims.

32:28.208 --> 32:30.166
Get out of here. Leave!

32:47.750 --> 32:49.125
Thank you, Lozano.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.666
And you? Why are you here?

32:58.500 --> 33:00.125
To laugh at our suffering?

33:01.166 --> 33:02.041
You bitch!

33:02.125 --> 33:03.500
-Get out of here!
-Bitch!

33:03.583 --> 33:05.000
-It's her!
-Get lost!

33:05.083 --> 33:06.916
-Leave!
-Folks!

33:07.000 --> 33:08.541
-Get going!
-People!

33:08.625 --> 33:09.750
-Bitch!
-People!

33:09.833 --> 33:11.791
-Murderer!
-Calm down, folks! Please!

33:11.875 --> 33:12.958
Get out of here!

33:15.041 --> 33:17.375
-Stay calm, people.
-You have no shame!

33:17.458 --> 33:19.458
Show some respect for the victims.

33:21.000 --> 33:21.833
Get lost!

33:21.916 --> 33:23.416
Everyone, please!

33:25.458 --> 33:26.833
Get out of here!

33:28.583 --> 33:29.708
Start it! Come on!

33:30.208 --> 33:32.583
Calm down, everyone! Please!

33:49.000 --> 33:50.125
No, let me go.

34:07.250 --> 34:10.208
I need to stop thinking.
Even if it's just for five minutes.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.750
I don't want to hear
her fucking music ever again!

34:41.833 --> 34:45.375
Or look at her damn drawings!
I want to forget all about her!

34:46.083 --> 34:48.083
Why didn't they find her body in the mine?

34:48.166 --> 34:49.166
Or Dad's?

34:53.333 --> 34:55.666
I want to bury them once and for all!

34:56.208 --> 34:58.250
Eva, what's going on here?

35:05.666 --> 35:07.666
Hey.

35:08.416 --> 35:09.458
Calm down.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.583
Easy. What's wrong?

35:14.375 --> 35:16.666
Tell me this is all a bad dream, Estrella.

35:17.166 --> 35:18.916
PUZZLES

35:19.000 --> 35:20.541
Tell me I'll wake up from this.

35:20.625 --> 35:23.708
THE 7 DIFFERENCES

35:27.083 --> 35:28.625
Don't let anyone near the house.

35:28.708 --> 35:31.000
Especially the press. Got it?

35:31.083 --> 35:32.583
-Okay.
-All right.

35:32.666 --> 35:34.916
Get out of here! Get out of Feria!

35:35.000 --> 35:36.458
Come with me.

35:36.541 --> 35:38.250
Come here.

35:39.541 --> 35:42.833
-I know you took stuff from the priest.
-I had to do it, Cuéllar, okay?

35:42.916 --> 35:46.958
Or do you want us to be on the news
because of Father Ezcaray's hobbies too?

35:47.041 --> 35:49.208
-We have enough on our plate as it is.
-Right.

35:49.291 --> 35:52.958
Except Guillén is investigating this
as a robbery, though nothing was taken.

35:53.041 --> 35:57.166
-This has to do with the cult.
-If that's the case, they'll find out.

36:00.750 --> 36:01.625
Cuéllar.

36:02.291 --> 36:03.416
Listen, Cuéllar.

36:04.208 --> 36:05.916
I'm doing this for the town.

36:10.000 --> 36:10.875
Fine.

36:19.041 --> 36:19.916
Are you happy now?

36:20.833 --> 36:23.541
Honestly, honey, what were you thinking?

36:23.625 --> 36:25.500
How do you think that makes us look?

36:25.583 --> 36:27.125
People were going to hurt her.

36:27.208 --> 36:30.541
It just wasn't right,
her showing up in the square like that.

36:30.625 --> 36:32.625
But Eva isn't her parents.

36:32.708 --> 36:33.958
Tell him, Mom.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.875
Even you could tell she's a normal girl.

36:38.583 --> 36:40.000
Don't be naive.

36:41.625 --> 36:43.458
Her parents

36:44.208 --> 36:45.875
were behind that cult.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.916
Their ideas are like a virus.

36:48.416 --> 36:52.416
They've infected Eva and Sofía.
Those girls aren't normal anymore.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.958
And if you get close, you won't be either.

36:56.041 --> 36:57.750
What do you want me to do?

36:58.333 --> 37:01.000
-Forget we're friends?
-You said it.

37:02.458 --> 37:03.291
Mom?

37:04.458 --> 37:07.375
"Fallen is Babylon the great.
She has become a haunt for demons."

37:07.458 --> 37:09.625
Now we must do what God asks of us.

37:09.708 --> 37:11.958
"Depart from her, my people,

37:12.458 --> 37:16.291
so as not to take part in her sins
and receive a share in her plagues."

37:16.875 --> 37:19.333
Go to hell, you and your fucking Bible.

37:20.875 --> 37:22.166
Show some respect.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.541
<i>I should go and apologize.</i>

37:30.375 --> 37:31.916
-She's all alone.
-She's not.

37:32.625 --> 37:36.833
She's got Estrella, the psychologist
from the shelter, and the officers.

37:36.916 --> 37:37.916
She's not alone.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Yeah, sure.

37:43.416 --> 37:45.041
Have you been watching TV?

37:45.125 --> 37:47.333
They're just adding fuel to the fire.

37:47.833 --> 37:51.208
And if we're not careful,
we'll all get burned too, Raúl.

37:52.416 --> 37:53.750
Have you seen those people?

37:55.041 --> 37:56.083
Have you?

37:57.625 --> 38:03.208
They've lost a son
or a brother or their mother, like Chisco.

38:06.041 --> 38:07.125
They're pissed off.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.000
Because they feel guilty.

38:09.083 --> 38:10.291
They ask themselves

38:11.541 --> 38:13.125
where they went wrong

38:13.666 --> 38:16.416
or "How could I be so stupid
as to let my kid join a cult?"

38:16.500 --> 38:17.583
Or whatever.

38:19.458 --> 38:20.833
But they'd never admit it.

38:20.916 --> 38:23.875
They want to blame someone else
and kick his ass.

38:24.375 --> 38:27.583
So if they see you with Eva,
they might kick your ass.

38:28.916 --> 38:30.416
Listen to me, Raúl.

38:31.875 --> 38:33.500
Now button this right.

38:33.583 --> 38:34.416
Made you look.

38:35.416 --> 38:36.416
Come here.

38:47.833 --> 38:50.875
CIVIL GUARD STATION

38:54.083 --> 38:56.583
They're helping out
monitoring the checkpoints.

38:57.208 --> 38:59.458
Looking for Pablo and the girl.

38:59.541 --> 39:02.625
-We put out her picture last night.
-Hold on.

39:09.166 --> 39:10.166
Why are you here?

39:11.333 --> 39:14.416
I'm feeling a lot better. No fever.

39:15.791 --> 39:16.708
You sure?

39:17.208 --> 39:18.333
Yeah.

39:18.416 --> 39:20.708
Okay. Give me a second.

39:22.916 --> 39:25.833
I took a walk around my garden
and was watering the plants.

39:26.333 --> 39:27.625
That's when I saw her.

39:27.708 --> 39:28.583
No.

39:29.458 --> 39:30.458
You mean a woman?

39:30.541 --> 39:32.541
Yeah. Definitely a woman.

39:32.625 --> 39:35.125
I'm not sure
we can get a more detailed sketch.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.541
She doesn't remember much.

39:38.541 --> 39:39.833
It's her.

39:39.916 --> 39:42.125
Her. It's her.

39:45.041 --> 39:46.375
Yes, it's her.

39:48.416 --> 39:49.791
What a waste of time.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.500
Thank the lady and send her on her way.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.458
So what do we do now
with the Father Ezcaray case?

39:56.125 --> 39:57.416
It's all yours, Marcos.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.541
It looks like a robbery.
I doubt it's related to the cult.

40:01.041 --> 40:04.000
I heard about this guy, Mani.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.958
Bring him in,
find out what he was doing that night.

40:08.791 --> 40:10.625
How's that for a welcome back, Sandra?

40:10.708 --> 40:13.958
The second you set foot in the station,
someone wants to put you in a cell.

40:19.708 --> 40:20.708
Sandra.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.375
Hey.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.833
I think she's right, Guillén.

40:29.916 --> 40:31.125
Right about what?

40:52.500 --> 40:54.333
I did it. Didn't I, Guillén?

40:57.208 --> 40:58.250
I killed him.

41:17.750 --> 41:18.750
Cuff her.

42:00.708 --> 42:02.500
Don't be afraid of Snowflake.

42:39.458 --> 42:40.458
Does it hurt?

42:47.041 --> 42:48.541
What did you give me?

42:50.916 --> 42:51.958
Does it matter?

42:53.875 --> 42:55.750
It's just a body. It's not important.

42:56.875 --> 42:58.958
Your spirit, that's what's real.

42:59.791 --> 43:01.416
Well, that's just awesome.

43:03.125 --> 43:04.791
But my spirit and I are leaving.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.916
You saw your friend,
the one who lost his mother.

43:10.875 --> 43:12.916
Do you know how much he resents you?

43:15.583 --> 43:16.791
And your sister, Eva?

43:18.583 --> 43:21.416
Why did they treat her like a leper?

43:27.083 --> 43:28.375
Search inside yourself.

43:32.250 --> 43:33.791
What is that pain you're feeling?

43:36.541 --> 43:38.958
Why are you so afraid
of your mother's body turning up?

43:42.083 --> 43:44.000
Sofía, ask yourself this.

43:47.666 --> 43:49.500
What god would create a world like that?

43:50.000 --> 43:51.791
A shitty god.

43:52.958 --> 43:55.000
He created this world.

43:57.416 --> 43:58.958
I want to get out of here.

44:10.041 --> 44:12.166
Let me show you the five veils.

44:14.250 --> 44:16.000
The path your mother walked.

44:17.500 --> 44:18.958
I don't want to die.

44:19.041 --> 44:20.625
You won't die.

44:21.416 --> 44:22.708
You will live.

44:23.250 --> 44:24.333
I am alive.

44:24.416 --> 44:26.208
You only think you're alive.

44:27.458 --> 44:30.291
You think we cannot transcend these walls.

44:30.875 --> 44:34.166
That the sadness you keep inside is real.

44:39.375 --> 44:40.375
Your hair,

44:41.333 --> 44:42.583
your arms,

44:43.458 --> 44:44.458
your skin.

44:45.041 --> 44:47.458
Sofía, the body
is nothing more than a prison.

44:49.458 --> 44:50.500
Leave me alone.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
You,

44:56.291 --> 44:58.250
who crossed the fire barrier,

44:58.333 --> 45:00.625
have received the empire
of the first gate.

45:01.208 --> 45:03.375
Geena, let me enter your kingdom,

45:03.458 --> 45:06.500
taken in the image
and likeness of the innocent.

45:48.416 --> 45:50.708
The first veil has been lifted.

48:27.583 --> 48:30.500
