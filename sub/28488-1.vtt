00:48.350 --> 00:51.975
- [Narrator] Early 1930s,
fascism is on the rise,

00:51.975 --> 00:54.642
and organized crime is born in England.

00:54.642 --> 00:58.975
Two gangs, the Italian Sabinis
and the English White family,

00:58.975 --> 01:01.600
join forces to consolidate
their control of London's

01:01.600 --> 01:05.141
West End and its murky underworld.

01:05.141 --> 01:08.975
In different parts of
town, two as-yet unknowns,

01:08.975 --> 01:11.683
Jack Spot Comer and Billy Hill,

01:11.683 --> 01:15.433
are starting to make
a name for themselves.

01:15.433 --> 01:18.767
This city has never looked so dangerous.

01:27.558 --> 01:30.975
(muffled lively chatter)

01:32.808 --> 01:36.100
- This Sunday, that pernicious
bastard, Oswald Mosley,

01:36.100 --> 01:38.642
will bring his British Union of Fascists

01:38.642 --> 01:40.517
through the East End!

01:40.517 --> 01:43.558
Through our East End, we're
not gonna let him, are we?

01:43.558 --> 01:44.350
No!
No!

01:45.558 --> 01:47.433
- So, let me ask you a question.

01:47.433 --> 01:51.767
Who here will join me in
protecting our homes, our families,

01:51.767 --> 01:55.475
our livelihood against that
treacherous hate mongering scum?

01:55.475 --> 01:57.642
(crowd cheers)

01:57.642 --> 01:59.558
- [Narrator] Meet Jack Spot Comer.

01:59.558 --> 02:03.975
Small part Jewish social
crusader, big part agnostic thug.

02:03.975 --> 02:06.350
He's cleaning up in his
local man of White chapel,

02:06.350 --> 02:08.475
and the East End generally.

02:08.475 --> 02:11.225
Nothing's going to stop him
becoming a serious player.

02:11.225 --> 02:13.933
<i>Not even Mosley and his fascists.</i>

02:15.683 --> 02:16.600
- Mr. Comer.

02:18.517 --> 02:20.142
Just as you said.

02:20.142 --> 02:22.433
The top third filled with lead.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.433
I hope you smash those
Blackshirts' brains in.

02:25.433 --> 02:27.392
- [Jack] Very good, Mr. Nelson.

02:27.392 --> 02:28.183
Very good.

02:29.725 --> 02:33.100
(moody orchestral music)

04:24.683 --> 04:27.183
- For the charge of grievous bodily harm,

04:27.183 --> 04:30.683
inciting public unrest,
and attacking not one,

04:30.683 --> 04:33.183
but several officers of the law,

04:33.183 --> 04:37.100
I hereby sentence you to
six months hard labor.

04:40.517 --> 04:43.017
(tyres screech)

04:43.017 --> 04:44.892
- [Man] On your toes, Bear!

04:44.892 --> 04:47.017
<i>(glass smashes)
(alarm rings)</i>

04:47.017 --> 04:49.225
- [Narrator] This is Billy
Hill, a North London boy,

04:49.225 --> 04:51.517
but he don't mind where
his work takes him.

04:51.517 --> 04:53.850
A prolific burglar and a deft thief.

04:53.850 --> 04:56.475
Ambition is definitely not
something he's short of.

04:56.475 --> 04:58.933
(alarm rings)

05:02.225 --> 05:04.850
<i>(glass smashes)</i>

05:11.975 --> 05:14.267
- [Billy] Thank you, Mrs. Bennett.

05:14.267 --> 05:19.225
(Mrs. Bennett sobs)
(car engine revs)

05:19.642 --> 05:22.392
(tyres screech)

05:22.392 --> 05:25.100
(hushed chatter)

05:33.558 --> 05:35.350
- [Man]Alright, next.

05:41.392 --> 05:43.392
- Mr. Sabini, Mr. White.

05:44.267 --> 05:45.933
Harry.

05:45.933 --> 05:47.725
- It's Mr. White to you.

05:47.725 --> 05:52.267
- There's only one Mr. White
here and that's your father.

05:52.267 --> 05:53.725
- Sit down, Harry.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.392
I said, sit down.

05:57.392 --> 05:59.600
Don't make me tell you twice.

06:01.892 --> 06:03.642
And you can wipe that smirk off your face,

06:03.642 --> 06:05.225
you dirty little toerag.

06:05.225 --> 06:10.100
There's an hierarchy around
here, son, don't you forget it.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.975
Apologise to Mr. White.

06:18.975 --> 06:22.600
- Apologies, Mr. White,
nothing disrespectful meant.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.433
- Prick.

06:23.433 --> 06:24.725
- That's enough!

06:26.558 --> 06:29.308
- Apologies, Mr. Sabini.

06:29.308 --> 06:32.933
- You're becoming quite a regular
round here, ain't ya, son?

06:32.933 --> 06:35.392
Word on the street is, you
knocked off that same jewellerâ€™s

06:35.392 --> 06:38.308
in Hutton Gardens twice in one week.

06:38.308 --> 06:41.100
You fancy yourself a bit, do ya, Billy?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.350
- Just got a sense of humour, that's all.

06:43.350 --> 06:45.017
- Yeah, well that's funny.

06:45.017 --> 06:47.225
What won't be funny is if
you make me laugh today

06:47.225 --> 06:49.808
with the size of your spoils.

06:49.808 --> 06:51.392
From what I gather,

06:53.975 --> 06:56.392
I need at least 50 quid.

06:56.392 --> 07:00.600
- I ain't got 50.
(Harry chuckles)

07:02.475 --> 07:03.267
Here's 80.

07:10.475 --> 07:11.850
- Good boy.

07:11.850 --> 07:12.975
Very good boy.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.975
(lively soft orchestral music)

07:22.475 --> 07:24.975
(Billy sighs)

07:37.225 --> 07:39.017
- Hello, Billy.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.892
- [Billy] Hello, Aggie.

07:43.017 --> 07:44.892
(tyres screech)

07:44.892 --> 07:47.267
(car clunks)

07:48.142 --> 07:50.100
(dramatic orchestral music)

07:50.100 --> 07:51.267
- It's the third time we've seen this

07:51.267 --> 07:53.058
and we still don't know how it ends.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.808
- And it's my favourite.
(Aggie chuckles)

07:54.808 --> 07:56.767
- It's my favourite, too.

07:57.725 --> 08:00.433
(dramatic music)

08:10.975 --> 08:13.350
(doors bang)

08:30.058 --> 08:32.600
(lively music)

08:39.225 --> 08:41.308
- Hey, Jack, good to see ya.

08:41.308 --> 08:42.642
- How you doing?

08:42.642 --> 08:44.725
- Hey, Jack, welcome back.
(Jack laughs)

08:44.725 --> 08:47.642
I'll get you a pint.
- Yeah. (laughs)

08:47.642 --> 08:50.183
How you doing?
- Good to see ya.

08:54.225 --> 08:55.850
- Moisha.

08:55.850 --> 08:58.183
- Welcome home, how are ya?
- Good.

08:58.183 --> 09:00.975
Sonny. (chuckles)

09:04.183 --> 09:05.142
- Mr. Comer.

09:08.933 --> 09:10.850
The name's Mulley.

09:10.850 --> 09:11.892
Darky Mulley.

09:13.142 --> 09:16.350
I own four Spielers in Soho
and have vested interests

09:16.350 --> 09:19.058
in every racecourse south of Cheltenham.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.225
I'm not a gangster, Mr Comer,
I'm not even a criminal,

09:22.225 --> 09:24.642
but what I do is not entirely legal,

09:24.642 --> 09:27.308
and for that reason, I
sometimes get some lowlife

09:27.308 --> 09:30.850
and some scum that frequent the property.

09:30.850 --> 09:33.392
Some of them are quite pleasant and fun,

09:33.392 --> 09:35.892
but some of them are not.

09:35.892 --> 09:38.975
I'm looking for an employee
who can handle the latter.

09:38.975 --> 09:41.808
In no uncertain terms,
I'll pay you a decent sum

09:41.808 --> 09:45.642
to take care of that and as
long as you don't kill anyone,

09:45.642 --> 09:46.683
the bobbies will stay off your back,

09:46.683 --> 09:49.767
'cause I'll pay them a decent sum, too.

09:49.767 --> 09:53.392
I'm not looking for a bargain, Mr Comer,

09:53.392 --> 09:56.517
or someone who gets too
big for their boots.

09:56.517 --> 10:00.767
I'm a fair man and I expect
you to do what I ask,

10:00.767 --> 10:03.683
and I expect you to do
it without any trouble.

10:03.683 --> 10:06.725
Now, if you can do this,
we'll get on handsomely.

10:06.725 --> 10:09.433
If you can't, I shall
thank you for your time,

10:09.433 --> 10:11.933
and I shall find someone else.

10:16.725 --> 10:19.142
- (laughs) Alright, who
invented copper wire?

10:19.142 --> 10:20.183
- Who?

10:20.183 --> 10:22.350
- Two kikes fighting over a farthing.

10:22.350 --> 10:24.642
(men laugh)

10:27.225 --> 10:29.392
Why do Jews get circumcised?

10:29.392 --> 10:30.225
- [Man] Why is that?

10:30.225 --> 10:31.767
- [Joker] 'Cause Jew
birds won't touch nothing,

10:31.767 --> 10:35.558
unless there's 20% off!
(men laugh)

10:35.558 --> 10:37.100
- Comedian, are ya?

10:40.600 --> 10:44.058
What's the definition of a Jewish dilemma?

10:46.517 --> 10:49.517
Free pork. (laughs)

10:50.517 --> 10:52.808
(men laugh)

10:57.808 --> 10:59.225
I got tonnes of these.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.892
This is one of my favorites.

11:00.892 --> 11:03.392
What happens when a
Jew walks into the wall

11:03.392 --> 11:04.808
with an erection?

11:04.808 --> 11:05.767
- What?

11:05.767 --> 11:07.808
- He breaks his nose. (laughs)

11:07.808 --> 11:08.850
<i>(glass smashes)</i>

11:08.850 --> 11:11.433
Got another one, a Jew boy
walks into his dad and says,

11:11.433 --> 11:15.558
"Give me 20 quid." (laughs)

11:15.558 --> 11:18.350
(spectators yell)

11:21.475 --> 11:24.142
(fast rumbling)

11:25.392 --> 11:28.142
(crowd cheering)

11:38.975 --> 11:41.183
<i>- Oh, useless bloody horse!</i>

11:51.892 --> 11:53.308
That was very passionate.

11:53.308 --> 11:55.433
- Mom says you're a bad influence on me.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.142
- Wish I was a worse influence on ya.

11:57.142 --> 11:59.058
- So do I.
- Do ya?

11:59.058 --> 12:00.600
- Well, yeah.

12:00.600 --> 12:05.142
But don't wanna get a bad
name for myself, do I?

12:05.142 --> 12:06.183
- Aggie Hill.

12:07.225 --> 12:09.975
What'd you think of that?

12:09.975 --> 12:12.850
- Now you're teasing me.
- No, I ain't.

12:12.850 --> 12:16.017
You wouldn't get a bad name
for yourself then, would ya?

12:16.017 --> 12:19.017
- I don't like it when you tease me.

12:19.017 --> 12:21.350
- I'm not teasing.

12:21.350 --> 12:22.808
What do you think?

12:26.558 --> 12:28.475
- Let's try win some money, come on.

12:28.475 --> 12:30.100
- That's my girl.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.225
- [Bookie] Come on, ladies
and gentlemen, come on!

12:32.225 --> 12:34.933
10 pound, Win Rider, five to one!

12:39.350 --> 12:43.642
Low Ranger at four to one,
Win Rider at five to one.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.975
(group chattering)

13:18.808 --> 13:21.683
(footsteps)

13:21.683 --> 13:23.933
- [Jack] Get out, out!

13:23.933 --> 13:24.725
Out.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.600
(banging)

13:38.558 --> 13:39.350
Mr May?

13:40.433 --> 13:42.350
I know you're in there.

13:43.517 --> 13:47.017
You come out now and I won't hurt ya.

13:47.017 --> 13:51.683
You can't go around abusing
Mr Mulleyâ€™s pitch like that.

14:01.183 --> 14:03.642
Don't make me do this, Mr May.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.642
(grunts)
(Mall groans)

14:13.642 --> 14:17.308
- [Man] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
drop the knife, pal.

14:17.308 --> 14:18.850
Stand up.

14:18.850 --> 14:19.642
Slowly.

14:21.267 --> 14:23.808
(knife clanks)

14:25.683 --> 14:28.808
(laughing)
(upbeat folk music)

14:28.808 --> 14:30.558
- Only a mug would shoot someone,

14:30.558 --> 14:32.600
'cause if you kill 'em,
that's the death penalty.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.808
Understand?

14:33.808 --> 14:36.183
Each time you on about
the Whites or the Sabinis,

14:36.183 --> 14:38.100
and trust me, you do,

14:38.100 --> 14:41.267
I ain't stupid, so once
I worked that one out,

14:41.267 --> 14:44.975
I knew I was just gonna get a beating.

14:44.975 --> 14:47.475
(Woman pants)

14:49.808 --> 14:52.267
(woman moans)

14:59.683 --> 15:01.183
- Jack.

15:01.183 --> 15:02.933
Elephant Dave's here.

15:04.225 --> 15:05.517
- Alright, Dave?

15:06.683 --> 15:07.475
- Jack.

15:09.350 --> 15:11.600
Just let me finish up and
I'll be right with ya.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.642
- Right you are.

15:13.642 --> 15:16.100
(woman moans)

15:24.017 --> 15:26.142
- Thank you for coming, and
thank you for sharing my

15:26.142 --> 15:29.017
enthusiasm for the London
County and Westminster job,

15:29.017 --> 15:32.308
which I believe will
be our biggest to date.

15:32.308 --> 15:33.892
Most of you know each other,

15:33.892 --> 15:36.683
but as we've got a few new
faces and as is customary,

15:36.683 --> 15:39.225
I'm gonna start by making
a few introductions.

15:39.225 --> 15:42.642
Elephant Dave, he's our
resident cat burglar.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.975
He's already done his job,

15:43.975 --> 15:46.642
hence his replica key to the front door.

15:46.642 --> 15:50.892
Billy Sparks and Mark Bear,
they're alarm specialists.

15:50.892 --> 15:53.142
Mr Russell fit the alarm system.

15:53.142 --> 15:55.975
Our confidence man on the inside as such.

15:55.975 --> 15:58.517
Big Bob, Grinning Mike and Easy Alan

15:58.517 --> 16:01.600
will break the safes,
hopefully in minutes.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.058
Jaguar Ken, Motor Mike,
and North Street Ronnie

16:05.058 --> 16:10.017
will nick our getaway vehicles
and drive us all to safety.

16:10.142 --> 16:12.517
- We sure it was Spot?

16:12.517 --> 16:16.642
- I've had it from two
reliable faces, it was him.

16:18.142 --> 16:20.767
(alarm blaring)

16:26.017 --> 16:28.892
(car horn blaring)

16:36.142 --> 16:39.017
(grunting in pain)

16:48.017 --> 16:50.808
- William Hill, your
frequency in these courts

16:50.808 --> 16:54.725
is a national disgrace, and
seeing as you are unwilling

16:54.725 --> 16:57.350
to name your accomplices, I see no choice

16:57.350 --> 17:01.308
but to sentence you to
two years penal servitude.

17:01.308 --> 17:02.600
(sobbing quietly)

17:02.600 --> 17:03.767
Take him down.

17:15.224 --> 17:20.183
(murmuring and chattering)
(smooth jazz music)

17:28.642 --> 17:33.600
Gotta build a bridge to you

17:33.933 --> 17:38.892
Gotta take some time to do

17:39.142 --> 17:43.933
I have got to make a start

17:43.933 --> 17:46.392
And build it straight

17:46.392 --> 17:50.100
Straight to your heart â™ª

17:50.100 --> 17:55.058
Gotta wait eternally

17:55.725 --> 18:00.642
Might take eternity

18:00.683 --> 18:05.350
But while we're still apart â™ª

18:05.350 --> 18:08.100
I'll build it straight â™ª

18:08.100 --> 18:11.058
Straight to your heart â™ª

18:11.058 --> 18:16.058
I will build it night and day

18:16.267 --> 18:18.642
Never resting

18:18.642 --> 18:19.892
(gun clicking)

18:19.892 --> 18:23.183
(man screaming in pain)

18:27.600 --> 18:30.933
(screaming in pain)

18:30.933 --> 18:32.433
- Shut up!

18:32.433 --> 18:34.433
Shut up, shut up!

18:34.433 --> 18:36.225
- Please, please Jack.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.975
- Please, please Jack, please Jack.

18:39.975 --> 18:42.350
You sound like a little girl.

18:46.017 --> 18:48.475
Who put you up to this?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.392
Who put you up to this?

18:54.017 --> 18:54.808
No?

19:03.183 --> 19:04.225
Unbelievable,

19:06.350 --> 19:08.058
Unbelievable.

19:08.058 --> 19:08.892
- What?

19:14.600 --> 19:15.475
Bloody hell.

19:22.725 --> 19:26.225
Let's say goodbye with a smile dear

19:26.225 --> 19:31.183
Just for a while dear we must part â™ª

19:33.350 --> 19:37.308
Don't let this parting upset you

19:37.308 --> 19:42.308
I'll not forget you sweetheart

19:46.183 --> 19:51.142
We'll meet again don't
know where, don't know when

19:55.433 --> 20:00.392
But I know we'll meet
again some sunny day

20:05.892 --> 20:10.850
Keep smiling through,
just like you always do

20:14.808 --> 20:19.725
Till the blue skies drive
the dark clouds far away

20:24.350 --> 20:28.100
And I will just say hello

20:28.100 --> 20:30.975
To the folks that I know

20:30.975 --> 20:35.933
Tell them I won't be long

20:36.142 --> 20:38.767
They'll be happy to know

20:38.767 --> 20:43.725
That as I saw you go, you
were singing this song

20:49.683 --> 20:54.683
We'll meet again, don't
know where, don't know when

21:00.475 --> 21:05.433
But I know we'll meet
again some sunny day

21:29.267 --> 21:34.225
And I will just say hello,
to the folks that I know

21:34.933 --> 21:39.600
Tell them I won't be long

21:39.600 --> 21:44.517
They'll be happy to know
that as I saw you go â™ª

21:44.517 --> 21:49.475
You were singing this song

21:52.350 --> 21:57.350
We'll meet again, don't
know where, don't know when

22:04.017 --> 22:09.017
But I know we'll meet
again some sunny day

22:14.683 --> 22:17.600
- You're not welcome
here anymore Mr Comer.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.975
(heavy thud)

22:26.642 --> 22:28.392
- Hello Jack.

22:28.392 --> 22:30.100
Thought you'd been conscripted.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.725
- I had, but now I'm not,
what's going on here?

22:33.725 --> 22:38.183
- Mr Mulley doesn't own
this gaff anymore, I do.

22:38.183 --> 22:40.767
A lots changed since you've been away,

22:40.767 --> 22:43.058
I own pretty much everything now.

22:43.058 --> 22:44.308
- Mr Mulley alright?

22:44.308 --> 22:45.600
- What, Darky?

22:45.600 --> 22:48.392
Yeah we're old friends, he's fine.

22:51.475 --> 22:54.225
But your presence will not
be tolerated around here Jack,

22:54.225 --> 22:56.683
you understand that don't ya?

22:59.600 --> 23:01.475
Don't be silly old son.

23:05.683 --> 23:07.683
- You understand the
potential consequences

23:07.683 --> 23:09.475
of what you're asking?

23:10.392 --> 23:11.183
- I do.

23:12.308 --> 23:16.850
- And for this, you're
willing to risk your life?

23:16.850 --> 23:17.642
-l am.

23:21.892 --> 23:23.767
- What is it Jack, hmm?

23:25.725 --> 23:27.600
Is it greed, arrogance,

23:30.517 --> 23:32.517
or just plain stupidity?

23:34.517 --> 23:38.933
- Blackout, rationing,
most every Bobby here

23:38.933 --> 23:40.850
called up to serve.

23:40.850 --> 23:42.850
Who knew wartime would
be so good for business.

23:42.850 --> 23:45.892
- Very true.
(laughs)

23:45.892 --> 23:48.975
- It's a brave new world
out there Mr Mulley,

23:48.975 --> 23:53.933
without the Sabinis, well, the
Sabinis would have ruled this

23:54.475 --> 23:59.392
the Whites are, and if it ain't
me, it'll be someone else.

23:59.850 --> 24:04.767
And if it's someone else, it'll
be more aggravation for me.

24:04.767 --> 24:05.808
Sol might as well just be the one

24:05.808 --> 24:08.433
to do it in the first place.

24:15.475 --> 24:18.058
- [Man] Well Jack my old son.

24:18.058 --> 24:21.392
Whatever you have to do, you have to do.

24:23.017 --> 24:25.975
- Jack Spot's taking over Soho.

24:25.975 --> 24:26.850
Understand?

24:28.433 --> 24:32.142
And he's looking for Al and Harry White.

24:32.142 --> 24:34.600
And anyone who tells him
where Al and Harry White is,

24:34.600 --> 24:36.308
gets a tenner reward.

24:40.683 --> 24:43.517
(passing traffic)

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
(grunts)

24:50.308 --> 24:52.850
- As if one war weren't enough.

24:54.142 --> 24:56.183
Bill give Badger 12 quid.

24:58.725 --> 25:01.767
(war planes roaring)

25:04.642 --> 25:07.892
(air raid sirens blaring)

25:07.892 --> 25:10.225
(loud crash)

25:13.558 --> 25:15.683
(sobbing)

25:36.933 --> 25:39.642
(coins clinking)

25:44.808 --> 25:46.558
- Sleep okay?

25:46.558 --> 25:48.183
- What do you think?

25:50.558 --> 25:51.350
- Here.

25:52.558 --> 25:54.933
I thought this might suit ya.

25:58.058 --> 26:00.517
- Where, am I gonna wear that?

26:15.017 --> 26:19.183
I could be the boy for
you if you stop saying no â™ª

26:19.183 --> 26:23.350
I'd do anything for you,
just give this boy a go

26:23.350 --> 26:27.683
I'd buy you lovely things all
day and serenade your nights â™ª

26:27.683 --> 26:30.058
I'd stand right by you, come what may

26:30.058 --> 26:32.350
And always treat you right

26:32.350 --> 26:35.683
You can be my everything
- Where's Robert?

26:35.683 --> 26:37.517
- Don't know who you're talking about Sir.

26:37.517 --> 26:39.267
- Robert, head barman.

26:39.267 --> 26:40.850
- No head barman called Robert.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.767
- Might close this place, can
I get anything on the house?

26:43.767 --> 26:47.142
Make it three G&Ts sharpish will ya.

26:47.142 --> 26:49.142
- Who's your uncle then?

26:51.683 --> 26:53.225
- Al White and who are you?

26:53.225 --> 26:54.642
- Jack Spot.

26:54.642 --> 26:56.892
I'm the owner now, there
ain't nothing on the house

26:56.892 --> 26:58.850
unless I say so.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.350
How much is that Stanley?

27:00.350 --> 27:01.767
- It's a guinea Mr Comer.

27:01.767 --> 27:03.392
- Have one for yourself Stanley

27:03.392 --> 27:06.225
and I'll take a lemonade.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.850
Let's make it 30 bob and we're all good.

27:08.850 --> 27:10.600
- Lemonade?

27:10.600 --> 27:12.017
That's a poofs drink innit?

27:12.017 --> 27:13.600
Grab some flowers on the way

27:13.600 --> 27:15.933
Please stop saying no â™ª

27:15.933 --> 27:17.933
We could walk along the street â™ª

27:17.933 --> 27:19.767
(loud thud)

27:19.767 --> 27:20.600
(man groans and yells)

27:20.600 --> 27:22.725
- Spot (moans)

27:22.725 --> 27:26.100
We'll be feeling grand

27:29.058 --> 27:32.267
- You tell your uncle that if
any his family come here again

27:32.267 --> 27:33.725
then they're dead.

27:38.975 --> 27:41.517
(upbeat music)

27:54.642 --> 27:57.517
- Well that makes an army in my book.

27:57.517 --> 28:00.017
Start rallying the troops son.

28:00.850 --> 28:05.850
- I'm looking forward to crushing
this yid once and for all.

28:09.350 --> 28:10.350
- Here ya are love.

28:10.350 --> 28:13.267

28:17.475 --> 28:19.100
Al White.

28:19.100 --> 28:19.933
- What about him?

28:19.933 --> 28:21.183
- He's just had a heart attack.

28:21.183 --> 28:22.058
He's dead.

28:22.058 --> 28:22.892
- Dead?

28:22.892 --> 28:24.433

28:36.683 --> 28:39.142
(door closes)

28:40.892 --> 28:43.642

28:48.142 --> 28:51.517

29:00.183 --> 29:01.142
- Bill!

29:01.142 --> 29:03.183
What the fuck is going on?

29:03.183 --> 29:05.475
- Just come to pay our condolences Harry.

29:05.475 --> 29:09.142
For all our differences, your
dad was an honorable man,

29:09.142 --> 29:10.308
a fair man.

29:10.308 --> 29:12.142
- Yids are not fucking welcome here.

29:12.142 --> 29:13.642
Get out now.

29:13.642 --> 29:17.267
- We didn't come here
to cause a scene mate.

29:19.142 --> 29:21.808
(dramatic music)

29:23.475 --> 29:24.267
- Get out.

29:25.350 --> 29:26.100
Now.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.100
(Spits)

29:34.017 --> 29:36.392
- You're here to fight Harry.

29:36.392 --> 29:40.308
Your dad was an honorable man, a fair man

29:40.308 --> 29:43.350
and twice the man you'll ever be.

29:43.350 --> 29:46.767
I look forward to destroying you slowly.

29:46.767 --> 29:48.767
(Spits)

29:58.808 --> 30:02.100
(car engines whirring)

30:12.058 --> 30:15.017
(door squeaks open)

30:24.433 --> 30:26.808
(fast thuds)

30:31.850 --> 30:33.183
- [Man] Get off me.

30:33.183 --> 30:35.517
- Take him round the corner.

30:36.850 --> 30:37.642
Look away.

30:41.850 --> 30:43.475
(man moans)

30:43.475 --> 30:44.350
- I'm sorry Billy.

30:44.350 --> 30:45.392
I'm so sorry.

30:47.058 --> 30:49.017
- How'd you set us up?

30:49.017 --> 30:50.517
(moaning in pain)

30:50.517 --> 30:52.517
- They said they send me when
I was with them if I didn't.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.767
I'm sorry Billy, I really am.

30:55.767 --> 30:57.392
- I'm sorry too, man.

30:57.392 --> 30:58.517
- No, no, no.

30:59.517 --> 31:00.725
You don't have to do this.

31:00.725 --> 31:01.642
- Oh, but I do.

31:01.642 --> 31:03.392
- No.
- I do.

31:03.392 --> 31:07.600
No one fucks with Billy
Hill and gets away with it.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.392
(screaming)

31:17.725 --> 31:20.308
(loud whistle)

31:21.725 --> 31:24.100
(loud thuds)

31:31.517 --> 31:34.058
(men grunting)

31:38.267 --> 31:40.892
(gulps)

31:40.892 --> 31:43.517
- We need to do something,
something daring,

31:43.517 --> 31:46.183
no ones even thought of it yet.

31:46.183 --> 31:48.767
Need to make a statement.

31:48.767 --> 31:52.558
So everybody knows who the
king of the underworld is.

31:52.558 --> 31:56.017
I'll tell you one thing for
sure, it ain't Harry White.

31:56.017 --> 31:59.017
(melancholic music)

32:05.142 --> 32:07.267
(sobbing)

32:30.392 --> 32:33.183
(car engine revs)

32:39.142 --> 32:42.100
(melancholic music)

33:23.558 --> 33:26.350
(man groaning)

33:26.433 --> 33:29.683
(loud thuds and grunts)

33:33.767 --> 33:36.725
(banging on tables)

33:43.475 --> 33:45.683
(cheering)

34:04.933 --> 34:07.642
(group chanting)

34:15.516 --> 34:17.016
- Alright, so how'd you want it?

34:17.016 --> 34:18.808
Short back and sides?

34:18.808 --> 34:21.100
- You're the fucking barber.

34:27.475 --> 34:28.266
- Alright.

34:29.141 --> 34:30.058
What's ya name?

34:30.058 --> 34:31.891
- What do you care?

34:31.891 --> 34:35.516
- Gotta make a note for
the records don't I?

34:36.433 --> 34:37.808
- Fraser.

34:37.808 --> 34:39.725
Frankie fucking Fraser.

34:43.683 --> 34:44.558
- Date of birth?

34:44.558 --> 34:45.850
- Oh for fuck's sake.

34:45.850 --> 34:50.391
- Well it ain't 'cause I

34:51.933 --> 34:53.725

34:55.683 --> 34:57.267
- Seriously?

34:57.267 --> 34:59.225
- What you calling me a liar?

34:59.225 --> 35:00.933
- Same birthday as me.

35:00.933 --> 35:03.808
- And that's suppose to impress me?

35:15.683 --> 35:17.517
- So what you in for Frankie?

35:17.517 --> 35:19.600
- Carving blokes up.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.850
- Now you're clumping screws for fun.

35:21.850 --> 35:23.225
- What's not to like?

35:23.225 --> 35:26.225
- Only so much time a
fella can do in solitary.

35:26.225 --> 35:29.100
- Thing is, I like beating screws up

35:29.100 --> 35:34.058
and I like solitary, so
it's a win/win for me.

35:34.225 --> 35:36.058
- Who'd you rather be?

35:36.058 --> 35:38.892
Out on the town with a
nice couple of Richards,

35:38.892 --> 35:40.933
or stuck in here with me?

35:42.600 --> 35:43.892
- Fair play.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.183
I do like birds.

35:46.308 --> 35:50.433
- Thank God for that. (both laughing)

35:50.433 --> 35:52.017
Here ya hold still.

35:57.392 --> 36:00.142

36:05.100 --> 36:08.433
Get up.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.350

36:28.767 --> 36:31.058
Let's go gentlemen, come on.

36:36.517 --> 36:39.475

36:39.475 --> 36:40.642
- What about him?

36:40.725 --> 36:42.058

36:42.058 --> 36:44.225

36:48.308 --> 36:49.975
Sold them all on the black market.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.267
Biggest job ever apparently.

36:54.392 --> 36:55.600
- Mug.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.725
- What?

36:56.725 --> 36:57.933
- Mug.

36:57.933 --> 36:58.850
- Who?

36:58.850 --> 37:00.642
- Me, you, both of us.

37:05.517 --> 37:07.392
Spot's out here making a name for himself

37:07.392 --> 37:10.933
and we're stuck in this
khazi wasting away.

37:23.850 --> 37:28.767
You'll be home again soon

37:32.225 --> 37:37.183
We'll be singing this too

37:39.475 --> 37:44.392
Yes you'll be back again

37:45.683 --> 37:50.642
Just such as sunshine follows rain

37:52.392 --> 37:57.350
And I know I'll see
your smiling face again

38:04.308 --> 38:07.933
You'll be home again soon

38:17.850 --> 38:20.558
(crowd cheering)

38:33.392 --> 38:36.308
Well I'm reading all about
it people on the phone

38:36.308 --> 38:39.100
Tell everybody here
about you coming home

38:39.100 --> 38:41.892
Open all the windows and
light up all the lights â™ª

38:41.892 --> 38:44.683
We're gonna have a knees up
'cause we won a war to right

38:44.683 --> 38:46.183
They're dancing in the street

38:46.183 --> 38:47.350
And jumping up for joy

38:47.350 --> 38:50.433
Doing the V-E-D-A-Y boogie woogie

38:50.433 --> 38:53.100
Hear the music playing
over London town

38:53.100 --> 38:55.517
Somebody told the
minister to come to town

38:55.517 --> 38:58.225
(crowd cheering)

39:01.725 --> 39:04.558
They're dancing in the
street and jumping up for joy

39:04.558 --> 39:07.267
Doing the V-E-D-A-Y boogie woogie

39:07.267 --> 39:09.975
V-E-D-A-Y boogie woogie

39:09.975 --> 39:13.308
V-E-D-A-Y boogie woogie

39:13.308 --> 39:17.267
- Get down (laughing) get down.

39:23.892 --> 39:26.100
(laughing)

39:33.642 --> 39:36.642
(paper scrunching)

39:36.642 --> 39:38.600
<i>(sighs)</i>

40:01.808 --> 40:04.683
(group chattering)

40:09.850 --> 40:12.642
- I'll have five quid on
one and five quid on three

40:12.642 --> 40:13.933
and the money you owe me.

40:13.933 --> 40:15.600
- No I don't owe you any money.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.850
- (mumbles) Speak English.

40:17.850 --> 40:19.392
You owe me money, you're a bookie no?

40:19.392 --> 40:20.850
- Yeah but
- There's eight of us

40:20.850 --> 40:21.808
and there's one of you.

40:21.808 --> 40:23.058
If you're gonna stand there taking bets,

40:23.058 --> 40:24.183
you have to pay me money.

40:24.183 --> 40:25.017
- That doesn't

40:25.017 --> 40:26.767
- A da da da dah, yes
you do, pay me the money.

40:26.767 --> 40:28.933
- But I don't have any..
- Pay me the money,

40:28.933 --> 40:30.683
pay me the money
- Oi!

40:33.017 --> 40:35.600
Lay off him, he's mine.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.642
- Not anymore

40:38.142 --> 40:41.767
(loudspeaker announcements)

40:56.100 --> 40:59.225
- [Billy] Dear Mr Comer,
my name is Billy Hill

40:59.225 --> 41:01.642
and I come out of Camden originally

41:01.642 --> 41:04.767
but I'm writing this letter
to you from Wandsworth nick.

41:04.767 --> 41:07.850
I won't lie, it's not the
first time I've been inside

41:07.850 --> 41:09.808
but it will definitely be the last.

41:09.808 --> 41:13.142
And believe you me, I'm a man of my word.

41:13.142 --> 41:16.308
I come from a large family
where blagging is in our blood.

41:16.308 --> 41:19.267
And so is honor, loyalty and respect

41:20.475 --> 41:22.517
and a need for constant juggling'.

41:22.517 --> 41:24.142
I'm doubting you know who I am.

41:24.142 --> 41:26.975
I very well know who you are,
as I've been a frequenter

41:26.975 --> 41:28.892
at Boots for quite some time now.

41:28.892 --> 41:31.100
I especially like the
house band you introduced

41:31.100 --> 41:33.350
after you took over from the Whites.

41:33.350 --> 41:35.517
Anyway, I've been doin' a lot of thinking

41:35.517 --> 41:36.975
since I've been inside

41:36.975 --> 41:38.225
and I know you Sonny and Moisha

41:38.225 --> 41:39.642
as your loyal and trusted men.

41:39.642 --> 41:41.433
I've even spoken to Moisha a few times

41:41.433 --> 41:43.433
and he's as solid as they come

41:43.433 --> 41:47.558
but, I'd like to offer
you my services, Mr Comer

41:47.558 --> 41:48.683
and I don't say this lightly

41:48.683 --> 41:51.308
as I've never wanted to
work for anyone before.

41:51.308 --> 41:53.767
You're different though, you're smart,

41:53.767 --> 41:56.517
you're forward-thinking
and you're fearless

41:56.517 --> 41:58.017
and I'd like to think our combined skills

41:58.100 --> 42:01.100
can be a dynamic and lethal combination.

42:01.100 --> 42:03.100
If you're at all interested
in finding out more

42:03.100 --> 42:05.017
than what I can put down on paper,

42:05.017 --> 42:08.183
you know where I am and I
hope to hear from you soon.

42:08.183 --> 42:10.475
Yours sincerely, Billy Hill.

42:13.475 --> 42:15.975
- [Man] Hello Jessie, how are you?

42:15.975 --> 42:18.683
- [Jack] I'd like you to
meet my friend, Billy Hill.

42:18.683 --> 42:21.100
- [Man] Hello mate, how good to see you.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.392
- [Jack] Good to see you John

42:25.142 --> 42:26.642
Two Jack bosses please Alex.

42:26.642 --> 42:27.892
- [Barman] Right away Mr Comer.

42:27.892 --> 42:32.850
- They've even named a drink
after me (both laughing)

42:33.433 --> 42:34.225
- Like it?

42:35.183 --> 42:36.183
- Very much.

42:37.100 --> 42:38.433
- This is the high life Billy

42:38.433 --> 42:40.642
and don't let anybody tell you
it isn't bloody marvelous,

42:40.642 --> 42:42.683
'cause it bloody well is.

42:44.183 --> 42:46.725
(smooth music)

42:49.558 --> 42:52.350
- Why'd you wanna work for me then?

42:52.350 --> 42:53.808
- Well Mr Comer.

42:53.808 --> 42:54.933
- Call me Jack

42:54.933 --> 42:55.767
(menacing music)

42:55.767 --> 42:58.642
- Well Jack, I admire you see,

42:58.642 --> 43:00.850
what you done with the
horses and the spiels.

43:00.850 --> 43:02.642
How you took on the Whites.

43:02.642 --> 43:04.808
Ain't a man who can touch you today.

43:04.808 --> 43:07.350
Well, I blackmailed lives see,

43:07.350 --> 43:09.600
not afraid of hard work I'm not.

43:09.600 --> 43:12.433
Just don't fancy going back
to that khazi you know?

43:12.433 --> 43:14.892
I wanna go steady as such.

43:14.892 --> 43:17.267
Work with the master
of all things criminal.

43:17.267 --> 43:19.642
Hope some of your success rubs off on me,

43:19.642 --> 43:22.808
some of your charm, some of
your organisational skills.

43:22.808 --> 43:24.933
- Not looking for ambitious men Billy,

43:24.933 --> 43:26.517
I'm looking for men who know their place.

43:26.600 --> 43:27.725
Last thing I want is a man who reckons

43:27.725 --> 43:29.767
he knows more than what I do.

43:29.767 --> 43:32.308
- You're the boss Jack, no argument there.

43:32.308 --> 43:33.642
- Handle yourself can ya?

43:33.642 --> 43:35.058
- I reckon so.

43:35.058 --> 43:36.267
Don't look for a fight.

43:36.267 --> 43:38.142
I won't run away from one neither.

43:38.142 --> 43:39.100
- Got a crew?

43:39.100 --> 43:39.933
- Yeah.

43:39.933 --> 43:41.517
Three blokes I trust with me life.

43:41.517 --> 43:43.517
One inside, two on the out.

43:43.517 --> 43:45.058
- Why what hours you keep?

43:45.058 --> 43:47.892
- All I wanna do is graft.

43:47.892 --> 43:49.308
- What about girlfriends?

43:49.308 --> 43:50.767
- I ain't married,

43:53.767 --> 43:54.808
well kind of.

43:57.808 --> 43:59.392
- Like anyone here?

44:02.308 --> 44:05.183
(group chattering)

44:11.642 --> 44:14.600
- Only the best for Mr
Comer's special friend.

44:14.600 --> 44:17.058
I just hope you can handle her Mr Hill.

44:17.058 --> 44:21.017
The key's in the box on the bedside table.

44:21.017 --> 44:23.683
(woman moaning)

44:24.850 --> 44:27.808
(suspenseful music)

44:42.850 --> 44:45.308
(door closes)

45:02.267 --> 45:06.058
(woman moaning in other room)

45:24.850 --> 45:27.267
- That says a lot about you Mr Hill.

45:27.267 --> 45:30.225
Most men never undo my hands.

45:30.225 --> 45:32.392
- Suppose I ain't most men.

45:32.392 --> 45:34.933
- I'll tell you in the morning.

45:39.392 --> 45:42.058
Nervous little kitten aren't ya?

45:43.100 --> 45:46.142
(uptempo jazz music)

46:05.683 --> 46:06.975
- I'm topped, I've got
almost every racecourse

46:06.975 --> 46:08.558
in the south of England.

46:08.558 --> 46:11.308
Ascot, Kempton, Ally Pally Brighton.

46:11.350 --> 46:13.642
I take a cut of everything
through the bookmakers

46:13.642 --> 46:15.642
right on down to the
ice-cream concessions.

46:15.642 --> 46:17.933
Average profit on the day is 5000.

46:17.933 --> 46:20.600
On Derby Day, we cleared 20,000.

46:20.600 --> 46:23.808
- You're making a bloody mint ain't ya?

46:25.808 --> 46:27.350
- Hi Albert.

46:27.350 --> 46:29.183
Not causing any trouble I hope?

46:29.183 --> 46:32.308
- Not if you don't start it first Jack.

46:32.308 --> 46:35.267
(suspenseful music)

46:42.850 --> 46:43.642
- Come on.

46:51.433 --> 46:54.725
(gentle romantic music)

47:04.975 --> 47:05.767
- Oh yeah

47:08.142 --> 47:09.850
Make yourself useful.

47:14.100 --> 47:15.225
- Hello Billy.

47:16.392 --> 47:19.475
Didn't expect to find you here.

47:19.475 --> 47:20.600
You gone all serious have you?

47:20.600 --> 47:22.767
Got yourself a proper job.

47:22.767 --> 47:24.600
- Yeah, something like that.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.850
- Working for that tight kike?

47:26.850 --> 47:29.225
That's a turn-up for the books.

47:29.225 --> 47:32.850
- Let's just say, I'm
expanding my horizons.

47:35.058 --> 47:37.975
- Tell Jack I want him out of Soho.

47:38.892 --> 47:41.642
I'm back and I'm here to stay.

47:41.642 --> 47:45.100
- I don't think he'll like that, Mr White.

47:50.933 --> 47:55.058
Enough fannying about, what you drinking?

47:55.058 --> 47:56.933
- Barman's choice.

47:56.933 --> 47:57.725
. Okay-

48:21.475 --> 48:24.183
(sloshing drink)

48:56.892 --> 48:59.517
(muffled music)

49:10.642 --> 49:13.183
(muffled thud)

49:19.142 --> 49:21.767
<i>(glass smashes)</i>

49:22.767 --> 49:25.225
(men moaning)

49:29.975 --> 49:32.350
(loud thuds)

49:42.017 --> 49:44.808
(glass tumbles)

49:44.808 --> 49:47.517
(repeated thuds)

50:08.558 --> 50:12.017
(quietly signs and moans)

50:25.225 --> 50:28.267
(dramatic music)

50:28.267 --> 50:30.308
(coughs)

50:38.683 --> 50:41.642
(adventurous music)

51:15.058 --> 51:16.850
- Bloody hell Frankie.

51:30.267 --> 51:32.017
- Is that your bloke?

51:33.017 --> 51:34.475
- Yeah that's him.

51:38.267 --> 51:39.850
(doors bang)

51:39.850 --> 51:42.475
<i>(gun shot, man screams)</i>

51:42.475 --> 51:44.933
(dog barking)

51:50.600 --> 51:52.600
- This is a week's
earnings down the crapper,

51:52.600 --> 51:54.558
<i>plus it's bad for business</i>

51:54.558 --> 51:56.308
and now I need to put
three times the protection

51:56.308 --> 51:59.933
on the front door to
prevent it happening again.

51:59.933 --> 52:00.767
- I'm sorry.

52:00.767 --> 52:02.600
- Sorry's meaningless.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.558
I don't care about sorry.

52:04.558 --> 52:06.517
I care about getting the quids in

52:06.517 --> 52:08.975
and getting that bastard back.

52:10.433 --> 52:12.100
I kicked him off the racecourses

52:12.100 --> 52:16.600
and now he's trying to
stage a West End revival.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.475
Same old drill chaps.

52:18.475 --> 52:20.142
Put the word out on the streets,

52:20.142 --> 52:22.975
10 quid reward for anyone
that tell us where he is.

52:22.975 --> 52:25.142
Lets nip this in the bud now.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.308
- Jack.

52:26.308 --> 52:27.433
- We're over.

52:27.433 --> 52:28.683
We're done.

52:28.683 --> 52:31.558
Get your stuff and get out of here.

52:33.517 --> 52:35.475
- I know where Harry is.

52:40.808 --> 52:44.350
(seagulls squawking)

52:44.350 --> 52:47.392
(man winces in pain)

52:57.308 --> 52:59.600
(laughing)

52:59.600 --> 53:02.808
(man moans and winces)

53:19.017 --> 53:19.850
- [Billy] Frankie.

53:19.850 --> 53:20.892
- Alright Bill?

53:20.892 --> 53:23.350
- [Billy] I'd like you to meet Mr Comer.

53:23.350 --> 53:24.892
- Alright Jack?

53:24.892 --> 53:27.058
Like darts do ya?

53:27.058 --> 53:28.683
- [Jack] I just wanna
find out where Harry White

53:28.683 --> 53:29.517
is signing out.

53:29.517 --> 53:31.808
- [Frankie] Yeah no problem.

53:33.933 --> 53:36.892
(heaving breathing)

53:38.600 --> 53:40.933
(man moans)

53:47.892 --> 53:52.850
I love those cheeky chaps
from the East of London

53:53.267 --> 53:57.392
They're always there with a smile

53:57.392 --> 54:02.350
I love those cheeky chaps
from the east of London

54:02.850 --> 54:06.725
They always go the extra mile

54:06.725 --> 54:11.725
I love those cheeky chaps
from the east of London

54:12.517 --> 54:16.267
They're always there with a smile

54:16.267 --> 54:21.225
I love those cheeky chaps
from the east of London

54:22.225 --> 54:26.683
They always go the extra mile

54:26.683 --> 54:31.642
Stepney and Shoreditch
and Bethnal Green

54:31.642 --> 54:35.600
Hackney and Shadwell and
the places in between

54:35.600 --> 54:40.558
I love those cheeky chaps
from the east of London

54:41.517 --> 54:45.975
They always go the extra mile

54:45.975 --> 54:47.808
They're fat they're tall they're thin

54:47.808 --> 54:50.850
They always love the skin they're in

54:50.850 --> 54:55.683
They're always there to
help you if you're low â™ª

54:55.683 --> 54:57.642
They'll walk that extra mile

54:57.642 --> 55:00.600
I know it's wiggle little smile

55:00.600 --> 55:04.850
To let you as you walk along the road

55:04.850 --> 55:09.808
I love those cheeky chaps
from the east of London

55:10.808 --> 55:14.433
They're always there with a smile

55:14.433 --> 55:19.392
I love those cheeky chaps
from the east of London

55:20.350 --> 55:24.850
They'll always go the extra mile

55:24.850 --> 55:29.808
Wapping, Whitechapel
and down they head east

55:29.808 --> 55:34.225
East and on the west and
other places that we meet

55:34.225 --> 55:39.225
I love those cheeky chaps
from the east of London

55:39.767 --> 55:44.725
They always do it with such style

55:44.808 --> 55:49.517
Cheeky chaps from the east of London

55:49.517 --> 55:54.267
They're always there with a smile

55:54.267 --> 55:59.183
Cheeky chaps from the east of London

55:59.183 --> 56:03.808
They always go the extra mile

56:03.808 --> 56:08.433
Cheeky chaps from the east of London

56:08.517 --> 56:12.350
They always do it with such style

56:12.350 --> 56:17.308
I love those cheeky chaps
from the east of London

56:18.392 --> 56:22.683
They always do it with such style

56:27.642 --> 56:29.767
(moaning)

56:41.350 --> 56:42.350
- Word from the
commissioner is the violence

56:42.350 --> 56:44.058
is getting out of hand.

56:44.142 --> 56:46.183
It's not good for public
moral, and it reflects badly

56:46.183 --> 56:50.267
on the force, hence forth,
anything that encourages violence

56:50.267 --> 56:54.850
is also bad for public morale
and reflects badly on us.

56:54.850 --> 56:56.267
Specifically your Spielers

56:56.350 --> 56:58.892
and every other illegal activity you run.

56:58.892 --> 57:00.517
- What are you saying exactly?

57:00.517 --> 57:04.725
- What I'm saying, exactly,
is if we're going to go on

57:04.725 --> 57:06.725
turning a blind eye,

57:06.725 --> 57:09.975
we're gonna need a bit more
encouragement from now on.

57:09.975 --> 57:11.100
Let's say we'll be having to turn

57:11.100 --> 57:14.392
two blind eyes every week, not just one.

57:21.683 --> 57:24.975
(safe door creaks open)

57:38.100 --> 57:40.392
(footsteps)

57:43.892 --> 57:45.475
- Where the fuck is all my money?

57:45.475 --> 57:46.933
- Our money you mean.

57:46.933 --> 57:48.642
We got more outgoings and less incomings

57:48.642 --> 57:49.725
than we've ever had.

57:49.725 --> 57:50.600
It's all in the bloody books

57:50.600 --> 57:54.600
if you ever bother to take a look at them.

57:54.600 --> 57:57.308
(women giggling)

58:27.558 --> 58:29.767
- Why don't you come and join us darlin'?

58:29.767 --> 58:32.558
Could do with bit of male company.

58:37.142 --> 58:40.558
- Just keep the noise down will ya?

58:40.558 --> 58:43.058
- Not going soft on us are you Jack?

58:43.058 --> 58:45.308
(laughing)

58:49.933 --> 58:50.725
- Ronnie.

58:51.808 --> 58:52.600
Dave.

58:53.517 --> 58:54.350
Mike.

58:55.808 --> 58:57.475
Bob.

58:57.475 --> 58:58.933
Billy.

58:58.933 --> 59:01.142
Another job well done boys.

59:01.142 --> 59:02.183
Thanks again.

59:06.850 --> 59:09.475
- Jack, sure it's a mistake but,

59:10.475 --> 59:12.350
I'm 100 quid down.

59:12.350 --> 59:13.808
- No mistake Dave.

59:13.808 --> 59:16.350
Sources come to me 'cause of who I am.

59:16.350 --> 59:18.183
'Cause of all my publicity.

59:18.183 --> 59:20.100
Therefore your opportunities are better.

59:20.100 --> 59:22.725
You're getting a better quality of job.

59:22.725 --> 59:25.017
Now I'm the King of the Underworld,

59:25.017 --> 59:27.017
I'm taking a larger cut.

59:27.850 --> 59:30.433
Have a problem with that do ya?

59:34.683 --> 59:38.225
Does anybody else have
a problem with that?

59:40.017 --> 59:42.558
(upbeat music)

59:45.892 --> 59:48.517
(group chatter)

59:50.725 --> 59:52.433
- What the fuck is going on in here?

59:52.433 --> 59:54.433
Get out, get out.

59:54.433 --> 59:55.225
Out.

59:56.183 --> 59:58.767
Daisy you get out and don't
you come back here again.

59:58.767 --> 59:59.892
Everybody out.

01:00:01.642 --> 01:00:03.642
- It's not what it looks like Jack.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.767
- You get out as well, you fucking whore.

01:00:05.767 --> 01:00:06.767
You thought I don't know?

01:00:06.767 --> 01:00:08.308
Of course I fucking know.

01:00:08.308 --> 01:00:10.225
I know everything.

01:00:10.225 --> 01:00:12.142
(slaps Jack)

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:13.558
Bitch.

01:00:13.558 --> 01:00:14.558
- Jack.

01:00:14.558 --> 01:00:16.808
(weeping)

01:00:16.808 --> 01:00:18.017
Jack.

01:00:18.017 --> 01:00:19.850
(woman gasps)

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.558
(repeated thuds)

01:00:27.225 --> 01:00:30.058
(woman heavy breathing)

01:00:30.058 --> 01:00:32.725
("London Town")

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:41.183
(door lightly bangs)

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.475
(short sigh)

01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:07.017
- So everything was a lie.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.017
- No, not everything.

01:02:15.183 --> 01:02:16.642
- Do you love her?

01:02:21.517 --> 01:02:23.517
You love her, don't you?

01:02:27.975 --> 01:02:29.933
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

01:02:34.892 --> 01:02:36.683
- I'm not angry Billy.

01:02:40.725 --> 01:02:42.308
I know I should be,

01:02:44.017 --> 01:02:44.975
but I'm not.

01:02:48.183 --> 01:02:50.058
I suspected for a while

01:02:52.392 --> 01:02:57.100
and I've spent years learning
to live without you anyway.

01:02:59.933 --> 01:03:03.225
It's not like you ever gave me a choice.

01:03:06.142 --> 01:03:07.933
- I did love you.

01:03:07.933 --> 01:03:08.808
I still do.

01:03:10.725 --> 01:03:12.142
It's just in a different way now.

01:03:12.142 --> 01:03:14.517
- Like I said, I'm not angry.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.808
But there is something I want from you.

01:03:29.517 --> 01:03:32.558
I'm bored of being a bored housewife.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.183
I wanna run a club.

01:03:44.267 --> 01:03:46.892
(gentle knocks)

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:52.850
(door squeaks open and lightly shuts)

01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:57.892
- Brought you these.

01:04:17.642 --> 01:04:20.017
You can offer me one of them.

01:04:43.017 --> 01:04:45.725
(chewing sounds)

01:05:13.933 --> 01:05:16.850
(group chattering)

01:05:19.892 --> 01:05:22.600
(romantic music)

01:05:46.225 --> 01:05:48.392
(kissing)

01:06:00.517 --> 01:06:03.225
(gentle tapping)

01:06:13.392 --> 01:06:15.767
(woman sobs)

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:18.767
(suspenseful music)

01:06:22.767 --> 01:06:27.142
- Okay let me have a
look, let me have a...

01:06:27.142 --> 01:06:28.100
Who did this?

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.308
Who fucking did this to ya?

01:06:30.308 --> 01:06:33.142
(moody saxophone)

01:06:38.142 --> 01:06:40.767
(man cries out)

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:44.225
- You remember Gypsy don't ya?

01:06:44.225 --> 01:06:45.058
- Who?

01:06:45.058 --> 01:06:47.142
(slashing knife, man yells)

01:06:47.142 --> 01:06:47.975
- Gypsy.

01:06:47.975 --> 01:06:49.975
She works for you yeah?

01:06:49.975 --> 01:06:50.808
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

01:06:50.808 --> 01:06:51.642
- Wrong answer.

01:06:51.642 --> 01:06:53.017
(man screams in anguish)

01:06:53.017 --> 01:06:54.892
Gypsy, does she work for you?

01:06:54.892 --> 01:06:56.975
(man sobs)

01:06:56.975 --> 01:06:58.725
Does she work for you?

01:06:58.725 --> 01:07:01.433
- No, no (yells)

01:07:05.017 --> 01:07:07.308
(loud thud)

01:07:12.017 --> 01:07:14.142
(weeping)

01:07:15.392 --> 01:07:18.767
(slow melancholic music)

01:07:32.808 --> 01:07:33.767
- It's over.

01:07:36.017 --> 01:07:39.058
You never have to work for him again.

01:07:44.642 --> 01:07:47.017
(woman sobs)

01:08:04.142 --> 01:08:05.975
- I'd have been impressed if
you hadn't been stupid enough

01:08:05.975 --> 01:08:08.850
to do it front of a dozen witnesses.

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:09.142
To do it front of a dozen witnesses.

01:08:09.142 --> 01:08:13.100
You put 50 bloody poor
stitches in his face.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.850
- I love her Jack.

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:18.392
- Yeah you and everybody
else she's fucked.

01:08:25.058 --> 01:08:26.475
Grassing is he?

01:08:26.475 --> 01:08:28.642
- Cop's friends bought him if you don't.

01:08:28.642 --> 01:08:29.517
Understand?

01:08:35.392 --> 01:08:37.267
- You have a word with him.

01:08:37.267 --> 01:08:38.892
Straighten this out.

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.600
- Do it your bloody self lover boy.

01:08:47.433 --> 01:08:48.225
- Please.

01:08:51.725 --> 01:08:54.017
(footsteps)

01:08:58.933 --> 01:08:59.725
- My pal,

01:09:01.142 --> 01:09:02.808
grab yourself a tea.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.183
- Alright Johnny.

01:09:08.183 --> 01:09:09.225
- Hello Jack.

01:09:10.683 --> 01:09:12.933
- I wanna ask you one question.

01:09:12.933 --> 01:09:14.517
What do you want?

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.392
Money or more stitches?

01:09:18.725 --> 01:09:19.517
- Money.

01:09:20.725 --> 01:09:22.308
- 'Cause you do.

01:09:22.308 --> 01:09:24.225
You're a low-life pimp.

01:09:26.308 --> 01:09:28.767
- You know he hates you don't ya?

01:09:28.767 --> 01:09:30.433
- Who does?

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:35.433
- Billy Hill, wants to
topple your empire he does.

01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:37.850
- What are you talking about?

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:40.892
(door bangs)

01:09:40.892 --> 01:09:43.683
(heavy footsteps)

01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:47.517
- What are you doing?

01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:50.017
Lost your nuts?

01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:52.558
- Taking what you owe me.

01:09:52.558 --> 01:09:55.683
The bird has a pimp, she
ain't worth the aggravation.

01:09:55.683 --> 01:09:58.100
400 quid you just cost me.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.225
You get in Spieler and turn it over proper

01:10:01.225 --> 01:10:04.725
and you keep your personal life, personal.

01:10:09.183 --> 01:10:10.475
Get out of my way Gypsy.

01:10:10.475 --> 01:10:13.225
- What are you gonna do, hit me?

01:10:13.225 --> 01:10:15.142
- Just get out of my way.

01:10:15.142 --> 01:10:18.267
- I'm worth way more than
400 quid and you know it.

01:10:18.267 --> 01:10:20.892
- Yeah, I paid you 500 didn't I?

01:10:24.017 --> 01:10:26.683
(fast footsteps)

01:10:33.933 --> 01:10:36.392
(men moaning)

01:10:42.642 --> 01:10:45.350
(repeated thuds)

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.725
- Maybe when you become a father

01:10:51.725 --> 01:10:54.142
you'll stop all this nonsense.

01:10:54.142 --> 01:10:54.933
- Maybe.

01:10:58.725 --> 01:10:59.975
- Well that should give you eight months

01:10:59.975 --> 01:11:01.600
to change your ways.

01:11:06.308 --> 01:11:08.933
(both laughing)

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:13.100
- My beautiful, beautiful girl.

01:11:22.892 --> 01:11:27.850
On the farm every Friday

01:11:28.308 --> 01:11:33.308
On the farm it's rabbit pie day

01:11:33.308 --> 01:11:38.308
So every Friday that ever comes along

01:11:38.808 --> 01:11:43.808
I get up early and
sing this little song

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:49.392
Run rabbit run rabbit run run run

01:11:50.183 --> 01:11:55.142
Run rabbit run rabbit run run run

01:11:55.392 --> 01:12:00.350
Bang bang bang bang
goes the farmer's gun

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:05.850
Run rabbit run rabbit run run run

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:11.058
Run rabbit run rabbit run run run

01:12:11.517 --> 01:12:16.475
Don't give the farmer his fun fun fun

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:21.850
He'll get by without his rabbit pie

01:12:21.933 --> 01:12:26.475
So run rabbit run rabbit run run run

01:12:48.183 --> 01:12:49.975
- I'm a crime columnist Mr Hill,

01:12:49.975 --> 01:12:52.433
so I will write about any
tit-bits you can give me

01:12:52.433 --> 01:12:54.517
confidentially or otherwise.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.517
Here is my card, call me
anytime, day or night.

01:12:58.517 --> 01:13:02.267
I don't pay much but it
all helps doesn't it?

01:13:02.267 --> 01:13:04.975
- I'm not quite sure you understand.

01:13:04.975 --> 01:13:07.892
I want you to write about me.

01:13:07.892 --> 01:13:09.100
- Oh, oh I see.

01:13:10.183 --> 01:13:12.142
Sorry who are you again?

01:13:13.017 --> 01:13:14.642
Who am I?

01:13:14.642 --> 01:13:17.058
Hill, I'm Billy fucking Hill.

01:13:18.017 --> 01:13:22.517
You'll do well to remember
that in future, alright?

01:13:22.517 --> 01:13:25.392
(group chattering)

01:13:42.683 --> 01:13:45.433
(slow footsteps)

01:13:51.392 --> 01:13:54.350
(nervous breathing)

01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:57.517
- Thing is Arthur.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.142
250 quid's a lot of money

01:14:03.933 --> 01:14:05.017
and I don't think you're gonna be able

01:14:05.017 --> 01:14:08.058
to pay that back on a postman's wage.

01:14:11.725 --> 01:14:12.517
Ever.

01:14:16.808 --> 01:14:21.017
So I think we need to be
a little bit more creative

01:14:21.017 --> 01:14:24.017
if we don't want Billy to get upset.

01:14:26.433 --> 01:14:29.058
So what I want you to do Arthur,

01:14:36.558 --> 01:14:38.267
is tell me something.

01:14:42.142 --> 01:14:43.433
I want you to tell me something

01:14:43.433 --> 01:14:46.058
you've never told anyone before.

01:14:49.392 --> 01:14:51.725
(man weeps)

01:14:54.017 --> 01:14:58.975
I want you to tell me something
you thinks gonna turn me on.

01:15:08.017 --> 01:15:09.225
- What you put on your Jew list?

01:15:09.225 --> 01:15:10.308
- Oh, I got a couple owing.

01:15:10.308 --> 01:15:11.933
Why didn't you come to me?

01:15:11.933 --> 01:15:13.058
- Went out on me nights (mumbling)

01:15:13.058 --> 01:15:14.142
(men laughing)

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:16.100
- He never does.

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.142
- Alright Jack.

01:15:18.142 --> 01:15:20.100
What's it like being yesterday's hero?

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.017
(thud and man groans)

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.517
(guns cocked)

01:15:27.475 --> 01:15:29.267
- Calm down boys.

01:15:29.267 --> 01:15:31.725
We're all mates here ain't we?

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.808
It's alright Freddie.

01:15:39.808 --> 01:15:41.933
Fancy a drink Jack?

01:15:41.933 --> 01:15:44.100
- You encroach on my territory Billy

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.892
and you're a dead man, promise you that.

01:15:47.892 --> 01:15:52.808
- You got most things here but
we don't got no Jack bosses.

01:15:56.475 --> 01:15:58.183
- If I had any sense I
would of slit you from here

01:15:58.183 --> 01:16:00.225
to when I met you in Wandsworth.

01:16:00.225 --> 01:16:03.558
Dumped your body in the Thames.

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:06.267
(dramatic music)

01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:09.517
- Yeah, if you would of had any sense,

01:16:09.517 --> 01:16:10.558
you would of.

01:16:42.392 --> 01:16:45.683
(rolling door and thud)

01:16:58.725 --> 01:17:00.933
(clicking)

01:17:01.975 --> 01:17:04.850
(group chattering)

01:17:11.850 --> 01:17:13.183
- You Jack?

01:17:13.183 --> 01:17:14.350
Jack the Spot?

01:17:20.267 --> 01:17:22.975
We've got a message from Albert Dimes.

01:17:22.975 --> 01:17:25.100
He owns the racecourse pitches now.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.267
You're over.

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:27.933
- Say that again.

01:17:27.933 --> 01:17:30.100
- We got a message from Albert Dimes.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:34.808
He owns the racecourse pitches
now, you're over and done.

01:17:40.475 --> 01:17:43.350
(rattling bottles)

01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:47.642
- I'm the king of the underworld.

01:17:47.642 --> 01:17:48.517
Not Billy Hill.

01:17:48.517 --> 01:17:50.350
Not fucking Albert Dimes.

01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:51.850
I'm the king of the underworld.

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:55.058
Jack Spot, Jack the fucking Spot Comer.

01:17:56.058 --> 01:17:59.850
I'm the king of the underworld,
l am, l am, l am, l am, l am

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:01.475
l am, l am, l am, l am

01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:06.683
(suspenseful music)

01:18:13.892 --> 01:18:15.267
(car engine roars)

01:18:15.267 --> 01:18:16.850
- Oh bloody hell.

01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:19.392
(cars screech)

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:26.683
(dramatic music)

01:18:26.683 --> 01:18:27.767
- The alarm's not working.

01:18:27.767 --> 01:18:30.433
<i>(glass smashes)</i>

01:18:39.517 --> 01:18:40.808
Ah, get off.

01:18:40.808 --> 01:18:43.100
(man yells)

01:18:48.142 --> 01:18:50.517
(loud thuds)

01:19:05.642 --> 01:19:08.058
- [Man] Go, go, go, come on.

01:19:12.183 --> 01:19:16.808
("Shake Rattle and Roll")

01:19:20.475 --> 01:19:22.600
- To the biggest haul in British history.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.892
(cheering)

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:28.808
Get out of that kitchen and
rattle them pots and pans

01:19:28.808 --> 01:19:33.767
Well roll my breakfast
'cause I'm a hungry man

01:19:34.558 --> 01:19:38.058
I said shake rattle and roll

01:19:38.058 --> 01:19:40.392
I said shake rattle and roll

01:19:40.392 --> 01:19:43.142
I said shake rattle and roll

01:19:43.142 --> 01:19:46.017
I said shake rattle and roll

01:19:46.017 --> 01:19:50.975
Well you'll never do
nothing to save your doggone

01:20:05.558 --> 01:20:07.808
- Move over Frankie.

01:20:07.808 --> 01:20:09.642
- Don't work like that no more Spotty.

01:20:09.642 --> 01:20:12.100
- You don't tell me how
things work round here.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.350
This is still my territory.

01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:17.308
- (cocks gun) Yeah?

01:20:19.392 --> 01:20:21.558
- You'll be thicker than I
thought if you pull that trigger.

01:20:21.558 --> 01:20:23.975
- Just be nice mate,
that's all I'm asking.

01:20:23.975 --> 01:20:26.767
Bit of respect, not so hard is it?

01:20:27.933 --> 01:20:30.808
- Just get out of my way.

01:20:30.808 --> 01:20:32.767
- What's the magic word?

01:20:39.725 --> 01:20:40.517
- Please.

01:20:43.267 --> 01:20:45.350
- Know what I'd really like Jack?

01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:47.767
Me, you a nice game of darts.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.142
(lively music)

01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:05.808
- Congratulations Billy,
well deserved I'm sure.

01:21:05.808 --> 01:21:06.975
- Thanks Jack.

01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:09.017
Champagne?

01:21:09.017 --> 01:21:09.808
- Why not?

01:21:27.017 --> 01:21:28.392
To your success.

01:21:28.392 --> 01:21:29.725
- To my success.

01:21:34.308 --> 01:21:36.183
Now how can I help you Jack?

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:37.600
- I've come to collect my dues.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.808
- Oh yeah?

01:21:38.808 --> 01:21:40.267
How'd you work that one out?

01:21:40.267 --> 01:21:44.183
- I'm still your boss and I'm
still king of the West End.

01:21:44.183 --> 01:21:46.017
And anything that goes on in the West End,

01:21:46.017 --> 01:21:48.308
I get a piece of the action.

01:22:00.308 --> 01:22:01.267
- Know what?

01:22:02.475 --> 01:22:04.975
I'll make you right Jack.

01:22:04.975 --> 01:22:06.517
Where's my manners?

01:22:07.433 --> 01:22:09.183
How much do you want?

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:18.892
This much?

01:22:22.267 --> 01:22:23.058
Or

01:22:27.058 --> 01:22:27.850
this much?

01:22:29.933 --> 01:22:30.975
Nah, nah nah,

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:35.350
it's not enough for the
king of the West End is it?

01:22:35.433 --> 01:22:36.183
How about,

01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:42.850
this much?

01:22:52.183 --> 01:22:54.017
One other thing Jack,

01:22:54.017 --> 01:22:56.267
I wouldn't kick an old dog when he's down

01:22:56.267 --> 01:23:00.058
bars you can keep but
the Mountain Air club,

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:01.808
well that's mine now.

01:23:18.392 --> 01:23:21.767
(loud thuds, man groans)

01:23:27.183 --> 01:23:28.017
(door bangs)

01:23:28.017 --> 01:23:29.642
- Who wants a fight?

01:23:29.642 --> 01:23:31.475
Who wants a fight?

01:23:31.475 --> 01:23:33.350
Who wants it?

01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:34.808
Who wants a fight?

01:23:36.767 --> 01:23:39.600
Who's the king of the underworld?

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.058
Jack Spot's the king of the underworld.

01:23:42.058 --> 01:23:43.808
Jack Spot, Jack Spot.

01:23:53.433 --> 01:23:54.475
- A lot of people are saying,

01:23:54.475 --> 01:23:58.392
the Eastcastle street
robbery was your doing Billy.

01:23:58.392 --> 01:24:00.808
- Well, obviously that's not something

01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:03.183
I can comment on Duncan.

01:24:03.183 --> 01:24:05.517
But what I will say is this,

01:24:05.517 --> 01:24:07.933
whoever did that job was a genius.

01:24:08.017 --> 01:24:09.433
A criminal genius.

01:24:10.725 --> 01:24:14.600
It was daring, it was slick,
nobody got properly hurt

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.975
which is important.

01:24:15.975 --> 01:24:16.808
- Indeed.

01:24:16.808 --> 01:24:20.850
- And it was the biggest
haul in British history.

01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:23.183
Pure genius.

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:26.600
- And where were you on the night?

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.600
- Of course I have an alibi.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.683
I was in one of my clubs with my girl.

01:24:30.683 --> 01:24:32.142
Lots of witnesses.

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.267
Cleared it all up with the Bobbies.

01:24:35.267 --> 01:24:38.642
Can't say too much though, mom's the word.

01:24:38.642 --> 01:24:39.725
(chuckling)

01:24:39.725 --> 01:24:42.975
- How many Spielers do you run now?

01:24:42.975 --> 01:24:46.933
- Let's just say, more than anyone else.

01:24:46.933 --> 01:24:49.642
(laughing)

01:24:49.725 --> 01:24:51.433
- So will this make you king of Soho?

01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:55.267
And therefore king of the underworld?

01:24:55.267 --> 01:24:58.100
(laughing)

01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.808
- If the cap fits.

01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:00.975
- Put it on.

01:25:00.975 --> 01:25:03.183
(laughing)

01:25:08.058 --> 01:25:12.350
Don't be tough, if you
can't take it rough

01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:14.058
You can take it rough

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:19.058
Don't play tough if
you can't take it rough

01:25:20.308 --> 01:25:25.267
That's just guys they,
they just don't cry

01:25:26.558 --> 01:25:31.558
Don't play tough if
you can't take it rough

01:25:32.767 --> 01:25:37.725
That was an engine when we were boys â™ª

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:44.058
We used to steal all my toys

01:25:45.433 --> 01:25:50.392
If you's scratch it
and clawing all day

01:25:51.433 --> 01:25:54.350
It was always my fault

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:58.142
Your mama would say

01:25:58.142 --> 01:26:03.142
Captain Robin was the same

01:26:04.017 --> 01:26:08.975
Your daddy said, I was to blame

01:26:10.642 --> 01:26:15.600
Bruises and blood all over the place â™ª

01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:21.808
But it was me in the sins of face â™ª

01:26:23.058 --> 01:26:28.017
Now your mama's gone
and your daddy too â™ª

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:34.225
We're all grown up but
we're far from through

01:26:35.517 --> 01:26:40.433
If you can't stand the
heat stay out of my kitchen

01:26:41.933 --> 01:26:46.933
Got a reason in my pocket,
now I'm just teaching

01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:53.308
Don't play it tough if you
can't take the rough

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:59.517
Don't play it tough if
you can't take it rough

01:26:59.517 --> 01:27:02.100
(men laughing)

01:27:13.975 --> 01:27:16.600
(phone ringing)

01:27:17.933 --> 01:27:19.475
- This is our home Jack.

01:27:19.475 --> 01:27:21.517
I don't want any of your business in here,

01:27:21.517 --> 01:27:23.183
let it ring, please.

01:27:41.017 --> 01:27:43.683
(phone ringing)

01:27:45.017 --> 01:27:47.308
(loud bang)

01:27:52.017 --> 01:27:52.850
- Hello.

01:27:54.267 --> 01:27:55.058
What?

01:27:57.392 --> 01:27:58.392
Who is this?

01:28:00.058 --> 01:28:02.058
How'd you get my number?

01:28:08.392 --> 01:28:09.183
Oi! Dave.

01:28:12.058 --> 01:28:13.683
Lets get something straight.

01:28:13.683 --> 01:28:15.308
You do not call me at home.

01:28:15.308 --> 01:28:17.558
You do not summon me to a meeting.

01:28:17.558 --> 01:28:19.808
And you do not interrupt my private life.

01:28:19.808 --> 01:28:21.517
And if there is ever gonna be a meeting,

01:28:21.517 --> 01:28:24.850
I'm the one that summons you, understand?

01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:28.058
- Not anymore pal, you're finished.

01:28:28.058 --> 01:28:30.475
And I don't want you at the races no more.

01:28:30.475 --> 01:28:31.475
That's over.

01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:34.517
- You can't tell me what to do.

01:28:34.517 --> 01:28:36.267
- I can, I am, I will.

01:28:38.892 --> 01:28:40.100
And I just did.

01:28:42.017 --> 01:28:43.558
Final warning Jack.

01:28:45.517 --> 01:28:46.933
- What about Kempton?

01:28:46.933 --> 01:28:49.142
(laughing)

01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:52.725
- Fuck off out of here.

01:28:52.725 --> 01:28:55.808
- Do you remember what I
did to you at Ally Pally?

01:28:55.808 --> 01:28:58.850
(thuds and groaning)

01:29:23.267 --> 01:29:25.225
(yells)

01:29:41.517 --> 01:29:44.475
(both men groaning)

01:29:48.892 --> 01:29:51.017
(screams)

01:29:59.183 --> 01:30:01.892
<i>(glass shatters)</i>

01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:25.517
(groaning)

01:30:25.517 --> 01:30:28.142
(woman screams)

01:30:37.808 --> 01:30:40.017
- Jesus mother Mary of God.

01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.058
- I got a put a stop to this.

01:30:53.058 --> 01:30:54.433
Are you carrying?

01:30:59.892 --> 01:31:02.600
(dramatic music)

01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:23.100
- Hello officers.

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:25.767
I'm here to see Mr Comer.

01:31:25.767 --> 01:31:28.892
- [Man] No visitors I'm afraid Sir.

01:31:28.892 --> 01:31:30.558
- You know who I am?

01:31:31.683 --> 01:31:33.808
- We know who you are Sir.

01:31:36.225 --> 01:31:38.142
- Mr Billy Hill.

01:31:38.142 --> 01:31:40.433
What an unexpected pleasure.

01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:50.350
It's a shame you can't all act like adults

01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:54.142
rather than a bunch of
trumped up school boys.

01:31:58.183 --> 01:32:02.725
At one point he really did
rather admire you, you know?

01:32:06.142 --> 01:32:08.100
- Feeling's mutual Rita.

01:32:12.975 --> 01:32:14.183
- And can you please point out

01:32:14.183 --> 01:32:16.975
the man who attacked you Mr Dimes.

01:32:20.683 --> 01:32:21.975
- He's not here.

01:32:21.975 --> 01:32:24.225
(group laughing)

01:32:24.225 --> 01:32:27.642
- [Judge] Silence means silence in court.

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:29.392
(group jeering)

01:32:29.392 --> 01:32:31.558
Or you'll be held in contempt. (banging)

01:32:31.558 --> 01:32:34.350
- Mr Comer, can you
please identify the man

01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:37.058
who attacked you on Frith street.

01:32:38.517 --> 01:32:40.892
(heavy sigh)

01:32:42.225 --> 01:32:44.017
- No, I don't see him.

01:32:44.933 --> 01:32:48.350
(crowd jeering and cheering)

01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:53.017
- [Judge] I will not have my
court turned into a circus.

01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:55.600
- Where is everything?

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.892
- I had to sell it.

01:32:56.933 --> 01:32:58.100
'What?

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:00.683
- Barristers aren't good Samaritans Jack.

01:33:00.683 --> 01:33:03.475
- Bloody thieves is what they are.

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.100
(melancholic music)

01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:15.308
We got anything coming in?

01:33:15.308 --> 01:33:19.933
- Dimes runs the racetracks,
Billy runs everything else.

01:33:29.267 --> 01:33:30.433
- What's this?

01:33:30.433 --> 01:33:32.517
- It's a savings book.

01:33:32.517 --> 01:33:34.558
You never would listen to me
so I've been putting money

01:33:34.558 --> 01:33:37.308
in for the last five years or so now.

01:33:37.308 --> 01:33:39.725
You're gonna be alright Jack.

01:33:43.392 --> 01:33:46.433
(clinking of glass)

01:33:46.433 --> 01:33:50.600
- Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all very much

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.017
for coming this evening.

01:33:53.017 --> 01:33:54.850
It really is a great honor
you've decided to spend

01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:56.933
your evening with me.

01:33:56.933 --> 01:34:00.517
Now, before I begin to
talk about my short,

01:34:01.683 --> 01:34:03.600
but eventful life.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.767
I'd like to say a few thank yous.

01:34:06.767 --> 01:34:08.725
I'd like to thank the
journalist Duncan Webb,

01:34:08.725 --> 01:34:10.975
for helping me write this.

01:34:10.975 --> 01:34:14.642
I'd like to thank my
beautiful girlfriend Gypsy,

01:34:14.642 --> 01:34:19.225
<i>for inspiring me to write
this, give me a kiss.</i>

01:34:19.225 --> 01:34:22.933
And I'd like to thank
my wife (group exclaims)

01:34:22.933 --> 01:34:27.892
Oi, you heard right, I'd
like to thank my wife Aggie

01:34:28.017 --> 01:34:30.267
for allowing me to write this.

01:34:30.267 --> 01:34:33.683
We're no longer together,
but she's a great girl

01:34:33.683 --> 01:34:36.600
and I'm happy to say,
we're still good friends.

01:34:36.683 --> 01:34:37.725
To you Mrs H.

01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:40.975
Oh, excuse me.

01:34:46.017 --> 01:34:46.850
Thank you.

01:34:52.142 --> 01:34:55.850
Oh, got a note from an
old acquaintance here.

01:34:57.642 --> 01:34:59.808
I hope it goes well tonight.

01:34:59.808 --> 01:35:02.267
I'm very sorry I couldn't make it.

01:35:02.267 --> 01:35:04.392
In a spot of bother, Jack.

01:35:05.475 --> 01:35:08.850
(group laughs and claps)

01:35:17.683 --> 01:35:19.225
Enjoy your evening.

01:35:34.892 --> 01:35:37.600
(dramatic music)

01:36:15.808 --> 01:36:16.683
- Good boy.

01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:20.475
- I don't know if Andrew
Koligi's worth it.

01:36:20.475 --> 01:36:22.392
I could hang if we got found out.

01:36:22.392 --> 01:36:23.392
- We'll work with what Jack said,

01:36:23.392 --> 01:36:24.850
he'd be sittin' in the Thames

01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:27.725
and we'll be at church
having Sunday roast.

01:36:27.725 --> 01:36:30.850
- We nick a car, wear
some masks, no witnesses,

01:36:30.850 --> 01:36:32.517
it's easy money.

01:36:32.517 --> 01:36:34.517
- Who killed Billy Hill?

01:36:34.517 --> 01:36:37.475
- Can see it in all the papers.

01:36:37.475 --> 01:36:39.475
- Who pulled the trigger?

01:36:39.475 --> 01:36:41.267
We all will.

01:36:41.267 --> 01:36:43.725
We shot and killed him.

01:36:43.725 --> 01:36:46.433
(dramatic music)

01:36:56.225 --> 01:36:58.558
- Did you have to Frankie?

01:36:58.558 --> 01:37:00.142
- Well they were gonna kill ya.

01:37:00.142 --> 01:37:02.058
- They're just kids.

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.642
- Killer's a killer Bill.

01:37:04.642 --> 01:37:07.392
Anyway I was just having
a laugh with these boys,

01:37:07.392 --> 01:37:09.017
teach them a few lessons in life.

01:37:09.017 --> 01:37:13.267
No harm done, all vital
organs intact and all that.

01:37:16.183 --> 01:37:16.975
- And?

01:37:18.142 --> 01:37:19.433
- It was Spotty.

01:37:33.892 --> 01:37:36.017
- Times have changed Jack.

01:37:37.392 --> 01:37:38.600
The freeholder,

01:37:39.767 --> 01:37:43.767
they don't need the aggravation anymore.

01:37:43.767 --> 01:37:47.100
And to be honest I can't
say that I blame them.

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.725
- It's all I got Mr Mulley.

01:37:49.725 --> 01:37:52.267
Without this, I've got nothing.

01:38:04.933 --> 01:38:06.642
- I been meaning to sort out my properties

01:38:06.642 --> 01:38:08.600
for awhile now.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.725
Just had other priorities.

01:38:12.225 --> 01:38:15.600
Being a landlord is not
to everyone's taste,

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.517
running a pub, well it's hard work.

01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.392
It's nothing that you ain't used to Jack.

01:38:23.392 --> 01:38:27.725
It's a lovely five bedroom
flat upstairs, rent free,

01:38:28.808 --> 01:38:31.017
if you want it, it's yours.

01:38:32.517 --> 01:38:36.058
- This is a lifeline Mr
Mulley, thank you so much.

01:38:36.058 --> 01:38:37.433
We'll take it.

01:38:37.433 --> 01:38:39.225
- You're welcome Rita.

01:38:40.683 --> 01:38:43.267
(gentle music)

01:38:52.058 --> 01:38:54.850
(car engine hums)

01:39:23.683 --> 01:39:24.475
Jack

01:39:24.517 --> 01:39:27.225
(multiple thuds)

01:39:35.183 --> 01:39:37.933
(Rita screaming)

01:40:43.058 --> 01:40:43.850
- Three,

01:40:47.142 --> 01:40:47.975
and six.

01:40:55.433 --> 01:40:57.808
(chattering)

01:41:31.517 --> 01:41:32.975
- Charles thought you were Jack Bosby,

01:41:32.975 --> 01:41:35.308
your bloke left a while ago.

01:41:35.308 --> 01:41:38.100
New bloke said he'd never heard of you.

01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:39.475
Sorry Jack.

01:41:39.475 --> 01:41:41.517
- What do you want Billy?

01:41:43.642 --> 01:41:46.850
- Came to visit you in
hospital the first time,

01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:50.850
wanting to make sure you
was alright, you know,

01:41:50.850 --> 01:41:53.100
in spite of everything,

01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:56.183
I wouldn't be where I am without you.

01:41:57.308 --> 01:42:01.142
Met your wife and she said
something interesting.

01:42:01.142 --> 01:42:04.683
Said we should stop
acting like schoolboys.

01:42:07.683 --> 01:42:10.350
Let's stop trying to hurt each other Jack.

01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:11.142
It's

01:42:12.017 --> 01:42:12.892
unbecoming.

01:42:14.433 --> 01:42:15.933
Let's call a truce.

01:42:17.433 --> 01:42:20.183
I've heard you might
be opening a pub soon.

01:42:20.183 --> 01:42:22.392
I think that's a good idea.

01:42:23.267 --> 01:42:25.433
I'll put the word out on the street,

01:42:25.433 --> 01:42:27.975
your place is a neutral zone.

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:29.808
I'll have a word with Albert and Frankie

01:42:29.808 --> 01:42:31.600
and square it all off.

01:42:33.808 --> 01:42:37.183
- Think you're the big boss now don't ya?

01:42:41.392 --> 01:42:44.100
What do you want me to do in return?

01:42:45.475 --> 01:42:46.892
- What you think?

01:42:56.808 --> 01:42:59.433
(whirling cars)

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.767
- What is this stupid
bloody thing you live by?

01:43:04.767 --> 01:43:07.933
Honour amongst thieves, a code of silence,

01:43:07.933 --> 01:43:09.392
well you're not a thief anymore,

01:43:09.392 --> 01:43:11.058
you're not a gangster, you're a husband

01:43:11.058 --> 01:43:13.600
and an unemployed father-to-be.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:16.600
And those men are nothing
more than pathetic bullies.

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.225
Pathetic bullies
who beat up a defenceless

01:43:18.225 --> 01:43:21.350
and pregnant woman and
they tried to murder you.

01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:23.517
Why would you ever want to protect them?

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.933
They're scum.

01:43:24.933 --> 01:43:26.058
They hate you.

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:29.642
They don't deserve the
respect you show them.

01:43:29.642 --> 01:43:33.183
And they certainly won't
be getting any from me.

01:43:33.183 --> 01:43:36.558
(soft melancholic music)

01:43:49.933 --> 01:43:51.850
- Can you identify the
men who attacked you

01:43:51.850 --> 01:43:54.058
and your husband Mrs Comer?

01:44:46.767 --> 01:44:49.558
- Yes they're over there.

01:44:49.558 --> 01:44:52.225
(crowd jeering)

01:44:55.683 --> 01:44:59.725
- [Judge] Order (bangs on table)

01:45:10.350 --> 01:45:12.642
Your disdain for human life,

01:45:13.683 --> 01:45:16.058
and your constant disregard

01:45:16.058 --> 01:45:18.600
for what makes these streets safe,

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.892
for the law-abiding citizen,

01:45:22.517 --> 01:45:26.058
I sentence you both to
seven years in jail.

01:45:28.683 --> 01:45:30.308
(upbeat music)

01:45:30.308 --> 01:45:31.475
(men groaning and loud thuds)

01:45:31.475 --> 01:45:32.975
- Megs, Megs, Megs

01:45:34.683 --> 01:45:36.017
- Here we go.

01:45:36.017 --> 01:45:37.142
Oi!

01:45:37.142 --> 01:45:40.642
<i>Fellas, stop it (glass smashes)</i>

01:45:40.642 --> 01:45:42.683
Get off him, get off him.

01:45:49.183 --> 01:45:51.392
<i>(glass smashes)</i>

01:45:51.392 --> 01:45:53.058
- You gonna finish your drink Ron?

01:45:53.058 --> 01:45:55.058
- I'll finish it afterwards Reg.

01:45:55.058 --> 01:45:56.642
- Fair enough.

01:45:56.642 --> 01:45:59.933
(loud thuds and groans)

01:46:03.558 --> 01:46:06.850
("Life is but a dream")

01:46:47.017 --> 01:46:49.808
(door squeaks open)

01:46:49.808 --> 01:46:52.975
- These are the two blokes I
was telling you about, Billy.

01:46:52.975 --> 01:46:54.100
- Ronnie Kray.

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:57.725
- Reggie Kray.

01:46:59.058 --> 01:47:00.475
- Good to meet you lads.

01:47:00.475 --> 01:47:02.517
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr Hill.

01:47:02.517 --> 01:47:05.475
We'd like to offer you our services.

01:47:16.892 --> 01:47:18.808
- [Narrator] Billy Hill
was wise enough to know

01:47:18.808 --> 01:47:20.683
when to call it a day.

01:47:20.683 --> 01:47:23.392
He emigrated to Tangier
Morocco with Gypsy,

01:47:23.392 --> 01:47:26.225
where they ran the infamous
Churchill's nightclub.

01:47:26.225 --> 01:47:30.475
He died on the 1st of
January, 1984, aged 72.

01:47:30.475 --> 01:47:33.767
His fortune and reputation still intact.

01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:39.767
Jack wasn't so lucky or smart.

01:47:39.767 --> 01:47:42.142
He and Rita stayed together for 15 years

01:47:42.142 --> 01:47:44.767
and had two children before breaking up.

01:47:44.767 --> 01:47:47.100
Jack slowly retired from
the criminal underworld,

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:49.642
and ended up working as
a barman, fruit seller

01:47:49.642 --> 01:47:52.433
an antique salesman amongst other things.

01:47:52.433 --> 01:47:56.975
He died in poverty on the
12th of March, 1996, aged 83.

01:48:08.433 --> 01:48:11.058
("London Town")
