WEBVTT

00:00.935 --> 00:02.368
To Cece, for booking

00:02.370 --> 00:05.270
her first
client's
first modeling gig.

00:05.272 --> 00:06.972
ALL: Hey!
ROBBY:
Cheers

00:06.974 --> 00:08.440
And to Winston
for making Donovan

00:08.442 --> 00:10.976
the face of LAPD's
recruitment campaign.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.611
I just hope he doesn't look
better in blue than I do.

00:12.613 --> 00:13.712
Wink.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.147
Oh, he definitely will.
He's a model.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.049
(clears throat) So in honor
of this occasion, we all

00:17.051 --> 00:18.517
got you gifts
for your home office.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.518
You may know it

00:19.520 --> 00:20.652
by its former name,

00:20.654 --> 00:22.688
the dining room table.
Me first.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.989
A cubicle,

00:23.991 --> 00:26.959
swinging balls,
Mm.

00:26.961 --> 00:28.861
an outgoing mailbox,

00:28.863 --> 00:31.296
a cartoon that is very
derogatory towards Mondays.

00:31.298 --> 00:32.531
So thoughtful, babe.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.033
Will that mailbox be functional?

00:34.035 --> 00:36.001
If it wasn't, it would just
be a box, wouldn't it?

00:36.003 --> 00:37.202
So can I buy a stamp
for this letter?

00:37.204 --> 00:38.537
It's not a post office, man.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.671
Who else has a gift?

00:39.673 --> 00:40.839
Whoo!
Bull button.

00:40.841 --> 00:41.840
You press that,

00:41.842 --> 00:43.909
guaranteed crowd pleaser.

00:43.911 --> 00:44.843
BUTTON:
Bull!

00:44.845 --> 00:47.112
(laughter)
Ooh!

00:48.215 --> 00:49.348
I got something better.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.750
Noise-canceling headphones.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.185
Thank you.
Wow.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.686
Yeah, are those mine?
Yes.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.089
They're broken.
Oh, nothing is ever
truly broken.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.058
All right, well,
I got you a filing cabinet

00:59.060 --> 01:01.427
to file all
the
headshots of your clients.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.096
FYI, Ferguson's in one of those
drawers making fluffies.

01:05.866 --> 01:09.268
"Fluffies" is cat farts.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.005
Bull!

01:13.007 --> 01:14.873
(laughter)

01:14.875 --> 01:16.675
♪ ♪

01:19.280 --> 01:20.279
Do you have a
stamp
for this letter?

01:20.281 --> 01:21.447
Is that a bill from when

01:21.449 --> 01:22.514
you were in the hospital?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.749
Oh, this?
Yeah, it is.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.584
Turns out they, uh,
they charge for new knees.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.785
(Robby chuckles, Jess scoffs)

01:26.787 --> 01:27.920
I feel so bad.

01:27.922 --> 01:28.921
I should pay
that.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.756
What?
Why?
Seriously?

01:32.526 --> 01:35.160
(yelling and grunting)

01:36.297 --> 01:38.030
(crack, Robby yelling)

01:38.032 --> 01:39.264
Oh my God, your bad knee!

01:39.266 --> 01:41.300
Oh, my God!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.868
But wait a
second,
why do you want to pay?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.570
I turned your
knee
into a bag of marbles.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.038
I should pay your medical bill.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.940
This is my only bill,
and it's just a baby bill.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.274
You know,
it's so small and cute,

01:49.276 --> 01:50.642
like my nephew Baby Bill.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.212
Give me that
baby.
I feel bad, but okay.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.081
Wait, how did you...

01:56.083 --> 01:58.450
(gasps)
I studied
pickpocketing
when I played the Artful
Dodger

01:58.452 --> 02:00.285
in my college production
of<i> Oliver!</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:01.920
Oh, wow, that's so cool.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.422
Oh, wait, so did I.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.656
What...

02:04.658 --> 02:05.724
Ow, Winston,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.392
straighten your arms
when you eat.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.727
You don't think I want to?

02:08.729 --> 02:11.130
Ain't no room,
fam.
Straighten your arms, fam.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.565
Then how am I
gonna reach my food?
Oh.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.234
Okay, I'm sorry,
the cubicle will be gone soon,

02:15.236 --> 02:17.102
but this is a
real
make-or-break moment for me.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.637
Either I'll look back
at this as my

02:18.639 --> 02:20.639
"Steve Jobs in the garage"
phase,

02:20.641 --> 02:22.441
or that misguided month
where I tried to be a manager

02:22.443 --> 02:24.076
at the dining room table.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.777
You are absolutely Jobs.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.446
And I'm Woz sitting next
to you the whole time

02:27.448 --> 02:30.516
in a... slightly lower chair.
(chuckles)

02:30.518 --> 02:32.451
And speaking of jobs,
by the way,

02:32.453 --> 02:34.086
you guys need to be like Winston

02:34.088 --> 02:36.255
and start getting jobs
for Donovan.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.757
Don't you basically work on ads
for a living, Schmidt?

02:38.759 --> 02:41.293
Yeah, well, my current
account
is for a menopause pill

02:41.295 --> 02:42.761
that eliminates night sweats.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.196
Oh, you're repping EstroFuel?

02:44.198 --> 02:45.831
Yes. Chest bump.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.999
NICK:
You know, maybe I could
use

02:47.001 --> 02:48.300
Donovan for the cover of

02:48.302 --> 02:49.801
<i> The Pepperwood Chronicles.</i>

02:49.803 --> 02:51.603
I mean, he wouldn't be
Pepperwood but...

02:51.605 --> 02:52.604
Gator!
Oh, Gator!

02:52.606 --> 02:53.839
It's perfect.
(laughter)

02:53.841 --> 02:55.274
He could be a great Gator.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.842
Why don't you
just
use a real gator?

02:56.844 --> 02:57.976
SCHMIDT:
What?

02:57.978 --> 03:00.145
Gator is Pepperwood's
best friend...
Mm.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.947
and clairvoyant brother.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.782
Oh, my bad.
Sorry, I haven't read it yet.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.150
What?
WINSTON: What?
Doesn't
matter.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.686
Clear the next 24 hours.
You haven't read it?

03:07.688 --> 03:08.887
It's really not that
big of a deal.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.189
I also don't have
an extra hard
copy

03:10.191 --> 03:11.323
so let's just
talk
about something else.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.058
Ooh, you can take mine.
(sighs)

03:13.060 --> 03:14.459
I've highlighted the more
sexual parts.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.460
I'm not ashamed.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.995
Great.
Great.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.497
Now you get to read
it.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.166
Now I get to read it.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.502
Robby's hospital bill
is only $400.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.570
That seem low to you?

03:24.572 --> 03:26.205
Did he have a minor
procedure?

03:26.207 --> 03:27.306
No, he had what the doctors call

03:27.308 --> 03:28.340
"a full Frankenstein."

03:28.342 --> 03:30.142
They put dog bones in his knee.

03:30.144 --> 03:31.743
Then that's way off.
It's got to be much higher.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.012
Do you think he thinks
I can't afford the full amount?

03:34.014 --> 03:35.881
(all agreeing)
What?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.316
Teachers have money.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.584
You guys know how large I live.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.152
I'm flush with cash.

03:40.154 --> 03:41.253
I'm paying that bill.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.354
I'm going to the bank right now.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.856
I'm probably gonna take
a limousine.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.092
Taking a limo to the bank.
What is she, a cartoon cat?

03:47.094 --> 03:48.694
(both laugh)

03:48.696 --> 03:51.029
He kills it every
time.
Every time, man.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.431
I'm sorry we got in a fight.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.700
I feel close again.
I'm not.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.768
Okay, Donovan, you just
caught a shoplifter and now

03:56.770 --> 03:58.203
you're
celebrating
with a street taco.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.539
That's exactly it!

04:00.541 --> 04:02.708
Get him, Donovan.
I love this.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.509
Get him, Cece.
Yeah,
okay.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.712
Donovan, you're a natural cop.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.780
Hey, what agency are you
from?
2L?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.015
Oh, um, hmm,

04:10.017 --> 04:12.851
I'm... from an agency that is

04:12.853 --> 04:15.387
uh, quite, um-- but...
Cece's Boys.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.723
Cece's Boys,
where the men are boys.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.625
and the-and the boys are Cece's.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.726
All right.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.727
You like it?

04:21.729 --> 04:22.894
I love it.

04:22.896 --> 04:23.895
You're going downtown!

04:23.897 --> 04:26.265
CECE:
Anything you say, officer.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.801
(playing complicated melody)

04:31.639 --> 04:33.238
Oh, hi, Jess.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.041
That was really good.
Just laying down
a stanky B line.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.644
Cool, cool. Hey, um,

04:38.646 --> 04:40.245
I feel like Baby Bill here

04:40.247 --> 04:42.881
has a lot of
brothers and sisters.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.650
So what's the real total?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.385
No, Jess, that's it, I swear.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.120
Come on, Robby, $400?

04:48.122 --> 04:49.221
I know what's going on here.

04:49.223 --> 04:50.455
You think I'm too poor to pay.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.657
I...
But you know what?

04:51.659 --> 04:54.092
Would a poor person...

04:54.094 --> 04:55.394
do this?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.262
How much is
it?
How much?

04:57.264 --> 04:58.430
Jess, I'm not gonna
tell you, okay?

04:58.432 --> 04:59.898
Unless you ask me repeatedly,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.667
in which case I'll eventually
crack. Damn it.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.235
What's the total?
Uh.. no.

05:03.237 --> 05:04.436
What's the total?
No.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.837
What's the total?
Not gonna tell you.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.439
(repeating quickly):
What's the total?

05:07.441 --> 05:08.874
$200,000.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.311
(plays<i> Seinfeld</i> opening
theme)

05:17.184 --> 05:18.250
<i> Seinfeld.</i>

05:22.790 --> 05:25.357
Moment of truth.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.826
Yup, here it is.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.594
So, please, don't feel
any pressure to like it,

05:29.596 --> 05:33.198
even though I spent
7,000 hours writing it.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.867
So without further ado,
or as Pepperwood would say,

05:35.869 --> 05:38.437
"Ah-don't."
(chuckles)

05:38.439 --> 05:40.172
You'll get that
when you read it.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.674
Here it is.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.042
Here it is.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.844
I cannot wait to read
this.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.212
I cannot wait

05:47.214 --> 05:49.981
to R-E-A...

05:49.983 --> 05:51.450
BOTH:
Jess!

05:51.452 --> 05:52.617
Hey, there she is.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.153
Oh, me, hey.
(chuckles)

05:55.155 --> 05:56.455
Sorry to interrupt.
Are you
re-reading

05:56.457 --> 05:57.689
<i> The Pepperwood Chronicles?</i>

05:57.691 --> 06:00.058
It is actually
my very first
time.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.160
A<i> TPC</i> virgin.
Yeah.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.229
"Ah-don't..." believe it.
(chuckles)

06:04.231 --> 06:05.630
I'll get out of your hair.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.499
No, no, no, stay.
No, what is all that
stuff in your hands?

06:07.501 --> 06:08.633
I'm totaling my assets.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.402
It's really
bleak.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.137
You can't say that
and then not elaborate, right?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.139
No, I feel like we should
really unpack
this.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.340
Really?
Definitely.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.708
Thanks, guys.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.810
Well,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.746
Robby's medical bills are
a
fifth of $1 million
dollars

06:20.748 --> 06:22.714
and I'm freaking out.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.416
I almost rounded up
all my ballet flats

06:24.418 --> 06:27.085
and sold them on
flattyflattyboomboom.com,

06:27.087 --> 06:29.354
the premier Web site
for used flats.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.856
Well, there are other options.
There are other options.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.392
Um, as somebody who passed
the bar exam eight years ago,

06:33.394 --> 06:35.527
I could offer you
legal expertise.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.662
I could read
the medical paperwork.

06:37.664 --> 06:41.166
Oh! An almost lawyer
and a sort of doctor.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.068
Lucky me.
Okay.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.936
Strategy sesh in the cubicle.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.405
I'll meet you guys there.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.841
Or we can go-- all go
together

06:49.843 --> 06:50.876
if you
want
Together.
Yeah.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.978
Yeah, let's go together.
Great.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.380
I rewrote the EstroFuel ad

06:55.382 --> 06:56.515
to star a hunk,

06:56.517 --> 06:58.683
and I got Donovan the gig.

06:58.685 --> 06:59.851
(Cece laughs)
WINSTON:
Whoo! Yes!

06:59.853 --> 07:01.920
Hey,
everybody,
I just want to let you know,

07:01.922 --> 07:03.789
I've thought about it,
and I'm quitting modeling

07:03.791 --> 07:06.158
to focus on applying
to police school.

07:10.697 --> 07:14.065
Honey, that is a very radical
career change, okay?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.101
That's why I like it.
I can't be tied down.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.070
Picture this:

07:19.072 --> 07:21.206
your mom has night sweats.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.574
She needs relief.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.976
Luckily, she has a handsome
son

07:24.978 --> 07:26.378
to go pick up
her supplements,

07:26.380 --> 07:29.781
because menopause
isn't
just about women anymore.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.983
<i> EstroFuel:</i>

07:31.985 --> 07:34.886
Putting the
men
back in menopause.

07:34.888 --> 07:35.887
Starring Donovan.

07:35.889 --> 07:36.888
Wow.
(whooping)

07:36.890 --> 07:37.889
That's... Wow,

07:37.891 --> 07:38.990
what an opportunity.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.225
But I'm becoming a cop.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.893
No. No!

07:41.895 --> 07:43.094
You are the face

07:43.096 --> 07:44.229
of EstroFuel.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.964
The shoot is tonight.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.998
Oh, my God, it's tonight?

07:47.000 --> 07:47.999
And I told my boss that

07:48.001 --> 07:49.434
Cece's Boys would be there.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.336
You told your boss...
Thank you, I'll see you
there.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.971
Winston, you ready
for the tour?

07:52.973 --> 07:53.972
Hmm?
The what?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.740
Huh? Yea...
(chuckles)

07:55.742 --> 07:58.076
Here's what happened,
let me explain this.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.644
Um, I offered Don

07:59.646 --> 08:00.812
a tour of the precinct,

08:00.814 --> 08:01.947
he accepted,

08:01.949 --> 08:03.114
and now it's happening.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.349
(sighs)

08:04.351 --> 08:05.917
Okay, Winston?
Winston!

08:05.919 --> 08:07.619
Yeah?
You better make sure that
this
is the worst tour

08:07.621 --> 08:09.354
that you've ever given anyone
in your life.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.489
And that's gonna be tough.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.758
I've given
some
really bad tours.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.827
(sighs)

08:15.829 --> 08:18.763
Okay, does this
rendering represent

08:18.765 --> 08:20.031
the incident in question?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.800
There was<i> way</i> more blood.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.301
Wait, come on, it was
not this violent.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.336
It was way worse.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.637
Grown men
fainted.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.772
Jess, I found something.
The hospital billed Robby for

08:27.774 --> 08:31.176
the Larry King Preemptive
Memorial Post-Op Recovery Suite.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.544
That's obviously a mistake.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.845
Uh, that's not a
mistake, actually.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.946
I needed a private
room

08:34.948 --> 08:36.515
because a lot of
times in my
dreams,

08:36.517 --> 08:38.850
I'm thinking about
concerts
that I really enjoy going to,

08:38.852 --> 08:41.653
so it's just a lot of me
clapping and singing
along.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.788
(sighing):
I can't afford this.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.490
Well, you don't have
to, just let me pay.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.158
No, you don't pay. I pay!

08:47.160 --> 08:48.393
What if no one pays?

08:48.395 --> 08:49.227
From my drawing,

08:49.229 --> 08:50.495
I don't see any signage.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.397
Do you see any signage?
So here's my question.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.665
Do you remember seeing

08:53.667 --> 08:56.167
any safety signs
near the machine?

08:56.169 --> 08:57.168
This is
important.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.537
There was just a poster
saying that

08:58.539 --> 09:00.038
they were closed
on Veteran's Day.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.206
That's what I wanted to hear.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.974
Folks, we got a lawsuit.
(chuckling

09:02.976 --> 09:04.175
Good job.
Great.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.410
Seriously, guys,
just let me pay this.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.811
Say that one more time. Say that

09:06.813 --> 09:08.580
you're gonna pay one more
time
and see what happens.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.648
Wow, okay.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.683
You know what usually
calms me down?

09:11.685 --> 09:12.684
A good mall walk.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.653
No, we're suing the gym.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.987
Nick, take it away.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.756
Well, I would love to,
but legally,

09:17.758 --> 09:19.057
I can't practice law.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.892
Yeah, I have a really good
lawyer, she's an animal.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.993
So you're on board now?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.029
Yeah, I just
go
with the flow.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.096
(phone beeps)
I'm gonna call my gal.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.599
We need the office.

09:27.601 --> 09:28.900
JESS:
What's wrong?
Yeah, so,

09:28.902 --> 09:31.503
Schmidt booked Donovan
a photo shoot at Ass Strat,

09:31.505 --> 09:33.238
but Donovan just quit modeling

09:33.240 --> 09:34.706
so that he could become a cop.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.440
(phone ringing)
A cop?

09:35.442 --> 09:37.008
It's my boss,
Kim.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.843
(sighing): God, I hate her.
Hello, Kimberly.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.844
You sound like
your skin

09:39.846 --> 09:41.346
looks amazing.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.181
All right,
Reagan,
you can get to reading.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.550
We can stick
around
if you want us to.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.918
I don't think it's necessary.
You need us?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.353
We'll stick around for you.
I don't think so.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.054
NICK:
Yeah, we'll stick around.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.121
Winston!
Winston!

09:50.123 --> 09:51.122
Me!

09:51.124 --> 09:52.123
Did you make police work

09:52.125 --> 09:53.191
look as boring as possible?

09:53.193 --> 09:54.859
I want so badly to tell you yes,

09:54.861 --> 09:56.561
but there was a situation.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.029
Protect and serve,

09:58.031 --> 09:59.564
more like protect
and
snooze.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.733
(sighing):
Yeah, this is boring.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.068
Bishop

10:03.070 --> 10:04.436
a
word.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.740
And the word is...

10:08.742 --> 10:11.676
"moo."

10:12.746 --> 10:14.245
ALL:
Moo!

10:14.247 --> 10:16.548
Shut up!
I-I'm the C.O.W.?

10:16.550 --> 10:17.782
I'm the--
I'm the cop of the week?

10:17.784 --> 10:20.652
ALL:
♪ Celebrate good times ♪

10:20.654 --> 10:21.653
♪ Moo moo ♪

10:21.655 --> 10:24.589
♪ Celebrate good times ♪

10:24.591 --> 10:25.423
♪ Moo moo ♪

10:25.425 --> 10:26.391
I'm home!

10:26.393 --> 10:28.460
Well, congratulations, Winston,

10:28.462 --> 10:29.628
on finally making C.O.W.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.663
And damn you!

10:31.665 --> 10:34.132
Cece, we're gonna have go
put out a menopause fire.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.433
CECE:
Let's go!
I made C.O.W., though.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.801
I made C.O.W., we ain't
forgetting about all that.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.969
ROBBY:
Okay, so,

10:37.971 --> 10:39.070
my lawyer says
I don't have a case

10:39.072 --> 10:40.605
against the gym
because I signed a waiver.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.140
A waiver? Jess,
you
did not say anything

10:42.142 --> 10:43.141
about a
waiver.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.676
Was that it?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.177
She didn't advise me
on anything else.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.345
Okay.
(chuckles)

10:47.347 --> 10:48.813
No one says
the word "advise"

10:48.815 --> 10:49.814
unless they got advice,

10:49.816 --> 10:50.815
so what did she advise?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.151
Uh... oh, no.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.953
What did she advise?
She didn't... it just wasn't...

10:54.955 --> 10:56.421
What did she advise?
It didn't...

10:56.423 --> 10:57.622
Come on,
what did she advise?

10:57.624 --> 10:58.590
She advised that I sue!

10:58.592 --> 10:59.424
I knew it! Who?

10:59.426 --> 11:00.392
You.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.094
Me?

11:03.997 --> 11:04.996
Nick, can I read your book?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.431
I was just about
to suggest it.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.866
NICK: Let's get out of here.
Schmidt and Cece need me.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.204
Whoa! God, what's that smell?
(coughs)

11:16.276 --> 11:18.543
I'm not gonna sue you, Jess.
Was that not clear?

11:18.545 --> 11:20.278
I told my lawyer that you're
just an innocent bystander.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.347
Okay? So, if we can,
uh, hit the mall?

11:22.349 --> 11:25.717
I mean, there is a big sale
at this Japanese cereal store.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.453
It sounds
amazing.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.056
You really think I was
an innocent bystander, do
you?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.791
Is that bad?
Yeah.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.893
I'm just saying
that I don't really think

11:34.895 --> 11:36.861
that you, uh,
ever do anything wrong.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.564
(laughs)
Anything? Ever?
Oh, we're starting

11:39.566 --> 11:40.865
to get into this. Look...

11:40.867 --> 11:42.801
I know a great place
where we can hash this over.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.369
It's a place called
Hash It Over.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.471
It's in the food court at
the mall, it's a hash
brown...

11:46.473 --> 11:47.706
We're not going to the mall.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.148
Why are you watching...

11:57.150 --> 11:59.017
Why<i> am</i> I watching you?
Why are you?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.719
I'm not anymore.
Okay.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.821
Weird to watch.
That's why I'm not gonna do it.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.255
Great.
Bye.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.257
I thought this was about
a bill, but
apparently,

12:06.259 --> 12:07.759
it's about
our whole relationship.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.427
How could I date
someone who
doesn't

12:09.429 --> 12:11.362
see me realistically?
No, but,
Jess...

12:11.364 --> 12:13.198
I mess stuff up all the time.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.500
Ask Nick. He
knows.
Nick, do I mess things up?

12:15.502 --> 12:18.002
You know it, baby. Bye!

12:18.004 --> 12:19.771
I promised I wouldn't come back,

12:19.773 --> 12:22.574
but it is a little uncomfortable
out there.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.242
(low snoring)

12:24.244 --> 12:25.510
(sighs)

12:25.512 --> 12:28.079
Jess, I know
that you have flaws.
Okay, name
one.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.781
(chuckles)
Uh... (clears throat)

12:29.783 --> 12:30.949
Easy.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.751
You walk too fast
through a museum.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.286
Although, it is pretty good,
because we get to see everything

12:35.288 --> 12:37.288
and then we have time
for the cafe afterwards.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.591
I'm gonna say that overall
it enriches the experience.

12:39.593 --> 12:40.925
That is just a compliment!

12:40.927 --> 12:43.895
I will be in the cubicle
drinking myself numb.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.131
Please, keep fighting.
Appreciate it.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.233
KIM:<i> I am paying</i>
<i> a top-notch photographer</i>

12:48.235 --> 12:50.201
to sit around and
bitch
about how hard it is

12:50.203 --> 12:52.937
to find French cigarettes in
Los Angeles. Where's the
model?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.439
Changing.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.442
Yeah, um, uh, Donovan,
are you almost ready?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.244
WINSTON:
I am changing.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.879
I am Donovan.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.480
What agency did you use
again?

13:02.482 --> 13:03.815
Cece's Boys.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.651
Look-- Cece herself showed up.
She's very hands-on.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.219
That's your wife.
I've met her many times.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.320
Schmidt,
if this falls through...

13:09.322 --> 13:10.955
Look, my client will be here,

13:10.957 --> 13:13.224
and if for some reason he's not,
that is on me

13:13.226 --> 13:14.659
and only me.
I'm gonna go

13:14.661 --> 13:16.661
shout into a toilet.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.631
Okay, well, what
are we gonna do now?

13:19.633 --> 13:21.332
Babe,<i> we</i> are not
gonna do anything, okay?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.834
You have done so much for me,

13:22.836 --> 13:25.136
more than any normal person,
and I love you.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.473
But if I am gonna graduate
from the dining room table,

13:28.475 --> 13:32.310
I need to learn how to manage
my clients on my own.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.013
(sighs)
Okay.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.149
Oh, man, that was intense.
Uh, also, Schmidt,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.418
I printed something--
do you know where it went?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.821
Not now.
Okay, it's voice mail.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.190
Donovan...

13:45.192 --> 13:47.992
I know that you don't want
to be tied down, okay?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.528
But that's why
being a model is...

13:50.530 --> 13:52.030
perfect for you.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.431
Because if you're a cop,

13:53.433 --> 13:56.100
then you're just gonna be a cop.

13:56.102 --> 14:00.505
But if you're a model,
then you can be<i> everyone.</i>

14:00.507 --> 14:02.340
You can be

14:02.342 --> 14:04.776
an ice cream man, a
rocketeer,
a jewel thief,

14:04.778 --> 14:06.211
or an underwear guy

14:06.213 --> 14:09.180
in a $10 million loft whose
only furniture is a
telescope.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.181
So, help me...

14:10.183 --> 14:13.518
help you...

14:13.520 --> 14:16.020
become the everyone
that you can be!

14:16.022 --> 14:18.022
That's how you do it!
That was awesome!

14:18.024 --> 14:19.057
Yes!
Right?
(chuckles)

14:19.059 --> 14:20.058
That was amazing.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.327
It felt good.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.995
You think it worked?
Couldn't tell
you.

14:23.997 --> 14:24.996
ROBBY:
<i> I know you're capable</i>

14:24.998 --> 14:25.897
of messing up.
Really

14:25.899 --> 14:27.031
Because you won't even admit

14:27.033 --> 14:28.399
that the gym thing is my fault.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.302
Your lawyer wants you to sue me,

14:31.304 --> 14:32.871
and frankly, I agree with her.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.806
So sue me.
I am not gonna sue you.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.575
Then how can I ever trust
you?
That doesn't make any sense.

14:37.577 --> 14:38.843
You know what?
If you're not gonna sue me,

14:44.985 --> 14:46.150
Bye, Nick.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.086
NICK:
See you, Robby.
I forgot you were there.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.220
Reagan was right.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.688
These noise-canceling headphones

14:50.690 --> 14:51.990

broken.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.558

14:59.699 --> 15:02.867
God, why are tiny rakes
so soothing?

15:02.869 --> 15:06.371
You know, I think I'm finally
starting to understand momentum.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.874
Which,
apparently,
my book does not have.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.442
Nick, everyone loves it.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.544
Robby wrote fan fiction for it.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.446
He wrote fan fiction?
(softly):
Yeah.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.615
That means the world to me.
He loves it so much.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.117
Don't take this the wrong way
about Robby,

Oh...

15:36.369 --> 15:37.468

15:37.470 --> 15:39.237

are going good,

15:39.239 --> 15:42.140

for reasons to doubt it.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.574

about Reagan?

15:51.284 --> 15:54.619
I don't know. Her opinion means
a lot to me,
so...

15:54.621 --> 15:56.955
Well, I think that's good you're
letting yourself be vulnerable.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.556

Who knows

15:58.558 --> 15:59.624

a bank account.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.998
Well, they're
kind of the same thing.
Well...

16:07.000 --> 16:09.600
You wanted to live on a lake;
I wanted to live on Mars.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.436
You wanted to be
a truck driver on Mars,

16:11.438 --> 16:12.270
