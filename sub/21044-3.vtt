WEBVTT

00:05.463 --> 00:06.590
Tell me the truth.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.509
Do you really have to do this?

00:09.300 --> 00:11.136
I want to hear you say it.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.597
You already know what I'm going to say.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.140
So say it.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.225
Say it, now!

00:17.308 --> 00:18.644
Okay. [clears throat]

00:19.227 --> 00:23.189
In addition to the laws of Dramaworld,
there are also some rules to facilitation.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.399
Rule number one.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.153
"Know your character."

00:28.863 --> 00:30.363
-You want it?
-Hm. Gimme, gimme, gimme!

00:30.447 --> 00:31.991
-You sure?
-Please!

00:32.115 --> 00:33.742
Take this. Yeah, that's yours.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.996
This is Seo-yeon.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.288
I love her.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.666
Hi, I'm Claire. I'm Seth's little sister.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.209
It's... it's really nice to meet you.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.170
Nice to meet you, too.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.088
Rule number two.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.011
[Seth] <i>"Do not affect events directly."</i>

00:55.513 --> 00:57.265
[squelch] Oh, my!

01:07.568 --> 01:10.779
[Seth] <i>Set objects in motion
and then just stand back.</i>

01:10.863 --> 01:11.947
[tingling sound]

01:12.031 --> 01:13.239
[Seth] Rule number three.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.911
"Do not watch the drama." [chortles]

01:16.994 --> 01:18.161
Do not watch the drama.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.582
[Seth] <i>Uh, in other words, this is not,
this is not a TV show for them.</i>

01:22.165 --> 01:27.755
<i>How would you like it if some creeper
started staring at your intimate moments?</i>

01:27.838 --> 01:29.882
<i>It's, Yeah.</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:31.341
Rule number four.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.802
And this is the most important
of them all.

01:33.886 --> 01:38.473
These characters cannot know
they're in a drama.

01:39.767 --> 01:43.311
If there are any secrets that you know
that they don't, you cannot tell them.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.815
These are the four basic rules
to facilitation.

01:46.899 --> 01:50.069
"In the event of a rule broken
by force majeure, see Appendix 2."

01:50.318 --> 01:54.031
No, but you won't need to see
Appendix 2, will you, Claire?

01:54.114 --> 01:54.949
No, no.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.744
Uh, but... just in case?

01:59.620 --> 02:03.832
No matter what, you do not want to
become a part of the storyline.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.752
-Trust me.
-Okay, okay!

02:07.377 --> 02:10.965
So say it. Say it, now!

02:12.007 --> 02:13.759
[Claire] Let me just top you guys.

02:15.678 --> 02:17.096
Oh, my god, it's you.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.641
And... you!

02:20.724 --> 02:22.935
Oh, my god, I love you guys!

02:23.393 --> 02:24.477
I'm very sorry.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.105
[Claire] What? [shrieks]

02:27.605 --> 02:29.108
[Seth] Thank god. [breathes heavily]

02:29.232 --> 02:31.110
Of course he doesn't love her!
He loves her sister!

02:31.234 --> 02:34.113
You just broke every single rule
in less than 10 seconds!

02:34.237 --> 02:36.824
Sorry, I mean I was just a little
star-struck. I mean, wasn't that--

02:36.907 --> 02:38.784
Yes, that, that was. [sighs heavily]

02:38.867 --> 02:40.368
Which is not a good sign.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.705
This isn't their drama,
they shouldn't be here!

02:42.788 --> 02:46.000
Crossovers are a sign that things
are not going well in Dramaworld,

02:46.083 --> 02:47.710
which is why you're here.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.335
To help set things straight.

02:49.627 --> 02:50.628
Right.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.548
-So...
-Right.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.891
[shuffling]

03:03.058 --> 03:04.101
What are you looking for?

03:04.267 --> 03:06.311
Um, salt?

03:07.021 --> 03:08.563
That's in dry storage.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.525
Thanks. Um, I mean...

03:12.776 --> 03:15.278
I'm new, so I'm just trying
to learn the ropes.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.450
Let me know if you need help.
I'll catch you up on everything.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.410
Hang on a sec.

03:23.787 --> 03:24.872
There you go.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.291
I know how it feels to be the new girl.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.879
I can see why he likes you so much.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.089
Who does?

03:34.882 --> 03:35.883
Chef.

03:37.425 --> 03:41.596
[Seo-yeon] He's not interested in me.
He has his eyes on her.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.854
She's sexy and attractive.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.482
And they've known each other forever.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.027
Whereas I'm just...

03:57.863 --> 03:59.489
I know this moment!

03:59.572 --> 04:00.698
What?

04:00.783 --> 04:02.659
Uh, nothing, nothing. Just...

04:03.243 --> 04:04.244
Like...

04:09.750 --> 04:13.128
[tranquil music]

04:16.840 --> 04:18.549
You're really beautiful.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.635
Let him see that.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.521
One moment, please.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.860
-Mrs. Park, what a nice surprise!
-Hello, dear.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.987
-Right this way.
-All right.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.156
Serving!

04:41.990 --> 04:42.991
[Claire] Yes, Chef!

04:47.037 --> 04:48.663
-Do you know where table ten is?
-Yes, Chef.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.666
Good. Position one, position two.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.501
[clears throat]

05:00.717 --> 05:02.177
[twinkling sound]

05:03.553 --> 05:04.679
You look different.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.224
I let my hair down.

05:08.683 --> 05:12.271
Well, put it back up. This is a kitchen.

05:13.604 --> 05:14.982
Sorry, Chef.

05:16.108 --> 05:19.153
-Got those mushrooms?
-I'm sorry, I forgot.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.530
-Grab some caviar while you're at it.
-Yes, Chef.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.201
I always set this table aside for you.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.368
[Mrs. Park] Do you?

05:29.704 --> 05:32.415
[pots clanking]

05:34.542 --> 05:37.296
Chef, your mother just arrived.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.671
[sighs]

05:38.755 --> 05:40.132
No warning as usual!

05:41.758 --> 05:43.468
Start her off with a salad
and the pork belly.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.469
Yes, Chef.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.431
Can you keep her company for me?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.309
Table eight, Chef.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.939
[Claire] Hey!
[stunned sigh]

05:56.023 --> 05:57.607
[thuds]
[Seo-yeon] Oh, no.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.861
So? Did he notice the new you?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.323
I got an earful for being unprofessional.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.074
You should...

06:07.326 --> 06:10.204
What if you introduced yourself
to his mother, right?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.247
Like,
what if you took her the food yourself

06:12.331 --> 06:14.540
and were like,
"Hi, Mrs. Park, nice to meet you."

06:14.624 --> 06:15.918
Impress her.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.794
-I couldn't.
-Uh-uh.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.254
You can.

06:22.507 --> 06:27.012
Mrs. Park, I actually had a few ideas
for Park Frozen Gourmet...

06:27.137 --> 06:30.933
[Ga-in] As you know, one-person households
are on the rise and...

06:37.981 --> 06:39.024
[Ga-in sighs]

06:40.400 --> 06:41.901
I'm sorry, Mrs. Park.

06:41.985 --> 06:45.696
Our sous-chef is still learning the ropes.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.534
Serving!

06:49.617 --> 06:50.493
[male #1] Yes, Chef!

06:55.915 --> 06:57.667
What do you think you're doing?

06:58.001 --> 07:00.087
You told me
to keep your mother company so--

07:00.212 --> 07:02.047
I wasn't asking you.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.882
You're the sous-chef.
Stay in your damn station!

07:05.300 --> 07:07.885
And fire me another pork belly and veal
for her entrée.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.012
Yes, Chef.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.601
-Uh...
-What?

07:15.685 --> 07:18.272
Claire, you're pushing too hard.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.606
You have to be subtle, invisible.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.525
You don't wanna risk
getting your own storyline.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.568
I'm trying.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.866
Nice of you to show your face!

07:29.950 --> 07:32.369
I came by to see
how your little restaurant is doing.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.661
Hello to you, too.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.082
I guess you're not happy to see me.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.210
[sighs heavily]

07:40.294 --> 07:42.795
Don't you think Joon looks
much better in a suit?

07:43.504 --> 07:46.549
This chef's uniform
sucks the life out of you!

07:47.675 --> 07:50.887
Joon always looks good
no matter what he's wearing.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.890
But you do have a point.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.813
A nice suit and tie
would look even more dashing.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.151
[resonance]

08:06.987 --> 08:08.030
What's happening?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.742
Flashback.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.495
Oh no, he's so troubled!

08:16.038 --> 08:17.788
I bet it's about his dad's murder.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.124
No, suicide.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.501
[resonance]

08:25.505 --> 08:27.090
I have to get back.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.056
Uh...

08:34.889 --> 08:37.642
I know it isn't explicitly stated
in the rules, but...

08:38.559 --> 08:40.937
you can't fall in love
with the lead, you know that, right?

08:41.396 --> 08:42.397
What?

08:47.361 --> 08:49.820
- Let's fire tables four and seven!
- Yes, Chef!

08:51.614 --> 08:54.784
Seo-yeon, how's the entrée for my mother?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.412
Sorry, Chef, but there's no ticket.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.914
[sighs] I verbalized it!

09:00.248 --> 09:01.624
Fire it now!

09:02.209 --> 09:04.211
Do you have anything else I can serve her?

09:04.294 --> 09:05.253
Oh, um,

09:05.337 --> 09:08.090
I have three portions of rotelle
that I can make into four.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.302
[shrieks]
[plate shatters]

09:12.885 --> 09:15.972
That's enough. I got this.
Just clean that up.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.975
[sad music]

09:21.311 --> 09:23.271
Seth, they've never had an off night
like this before.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.647
What do I do?

09:25.690 --> 09:26.649
I don't know. But...

09:26.732 --> 09:28.943
But whatever you're doing right now
is not helping.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.495
[metal clanks]

09:41.622 --> 09:43.166
[broken plate clatters]

[wiggling door handle]

09:56.637 --> 09:58.681
Huh? Oh?

10:02.059 --> 10:04.104
[pans clanking]

10:09.109 --> 10:10.067
Chef!

10:10.152 --> 10:11.153
Serving!

10:18.784 --> 10:19.910
Sous-chef!

10:21.704 --> 10:22.913
Manager.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.665
Manager!

10:27.419 --> 10:28.919
Would you please find my sous-chef?

10:34.468 --> 10:35.343
[sighs exhausted]

10:40.890 --> 10:42.142
-What are you doing?
-Door!

10:42.225 --> 10:44.478
Who said you could take a break?

10:45.895 --> 10:48.398
No, I was locked out.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.317
Locked out?

10:54.028 --> 10:55.363
Huh? [wiggling door handle]

11:03.037 --> 11:05.039
Serving! Tables two, six and seven!

11:05.373 --> 11:06.416
-Chef, fire!
-What table?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.875
-Fire!
-Every table's been fired!

11:07.958 --> 11:09.126
No, no, no! Fire! Fire!

11:09.211 --> 11:11.379
-No, no, no, no, no! Fire! Fire!
-Claire, no!

11:31.566 --> 11:32.609
Oh, gosh.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.489
Your father would have been
happy to see this.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.657
Mom--

11:38.739 --> 11:42.285
I want you to seriously think about
the life you've chosen for yourself here.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.830
Because it just seems like
a waste of time and money!

11:48.458 --> 11:49.959
[sighs heavily]

11:51.628 --> 11:52.837
[thuds]

11:53.212 --> 11:55.881
[mellow music]

11:58.759 --> 12:00.761
[Seo-yeon]
<i>Sorry, the door locked behind me...</i>

12:00.928 --> 12:01.929
[Claire] Oh, boy.

12:02.681 --> 12:03.848
Close the restaurant.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.478
I'm sorry, I just...
I saw the fire and I wanted to help...

12:10.355 --> 12:13.816
If the pan's on fire, just cover it.
That's all you need to do.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.445
I'm so sorry. I got scared and--

12:17.529 --> 12:18.738
It's my fault, Chef.

12:20.030 --> 12:24.243
I shouldn't have left the burner on.
You can take it out of my pay.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.079
It's not about the money.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.124
[footsteps]

12:31.250 --> 12:34.671
It's about the lack of professionalism.

12:35.714 --> 12:40.050
How can I run a restaurant
when I can't trust my own sous-chef?

12:40.552 --> 12:43.053
-I'm sorry?
-[Joon] I can't let this stand.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.473
Whatever it is...

12:46.098 --> 12:48.100
I can't have it in my kitchen.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.144
I'm trying to run a business here.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.065
Are you...

12:56.735 --> 12:58.152
Are you firing me?

12:59.738 --> 13:00.739
Yes.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.533
I think that's for the best.

13:04.867 --> 13:09.706
[Korean song playing]
