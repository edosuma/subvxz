WEBVTT

00:00.917 --> 00:04.462
Wait. So someone just
submitted this to you?

00:04.504 --> 00:06.464
Yeah,
to my Riverdale Choice email.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.637
In case you're wondering
if I can suddenly hear again,

00:12.679 --> 00:14.597
I can't. What I can do

00:14.639 --> 00:17.225
post-explosion is read minds.

00:17.267 --> 00:21.021
I can hear the words forming
in a person's brain just before
they speak them.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.940
It's, uh,
slightly disorienting.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.650
[Tabitha] Ugh.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.694
[Tabitha's voice] I mean,
everyone is entitled--

00:27.736 --> 00:31.197
I mean, everyone is entitled
to their own opinion,
but yikes.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.742
I know.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.036
That's why I published
it anonymously,
to protect our identity,

00:36.077 --> 00:37.454
which they asked me to.

00:40.498 --> 00:43.126
Tabitha and my friends
think my hearing's returned.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.920
It's not impossible to believe,
the doctor said it might.

00:45.962 --> 00:48.882
Am I a bad person
for lying to her, to everyone?

00:48.923 --> 00:50.467
[Tabitha] I don't know,
Jughead.

00:50.508 --> 00:53.344
What will the town think?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.512
What will they do?

00:54.554 --> 00:55.805
[sighing]

00:55.847 --> 00:58.433
That is a great question.

00:58.475 --> 01:02.645
[Jughead] Already I could feel
shock waves rippling
across the town.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.190
The article was
a blistering critique
of Riverdale.

01:05.231 --> 01:08.818
What the town presented as
versus what it truly was.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.529
It excoriated Veronica
and Reggie's Casino,

01:11.571 --> 01:13.782
calling it illegal,

01:13.823 --> 01:17.452
claiming it would be
a gateway to crime,
drug use and violence.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.663
It condemned Riverdale's
culture of street gangs.

01:20.705 --> 01:25.085
The Serpents and Ghoulies
forever teetering
on the brink of war.

01:25.126 --> 01:28.171
It called out
the town's long history
of intolerance, ignorance,

01:28.213 --> 01:30.423
persecution and
backwards thinking.

01:30.465 --> 01:34.094
It highlighted our overtaxed,
ineffectual law enforcement,

01:34.135 --> 01:36.971
our utter lack of culture
and the performing arts.

01:37.013 --> 01:40.850
But its most scathing
critique took aim at
Riverdale's struggling economy,

01:40.892 --> 01:45.480
soaring unemployment and quote,
"Homeless encampments
on every corner."

01:45.522 --> 01:47.273
Still happy you moved
here, stranger?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.276
Oh, yes.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.196
Happy as a clam.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.781
[Jughead]
Every word was a razor blade

01:54.823 --> 01:57.742
that cut to the very heart
of Riverdale itself.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.744
With no author named,

01:59.786 --> 02:02.247
who would take the brunt
of blowback? But...

02:02.288 --> 02:03.998
[Archie] I can't believe
Jug would do this.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.500
Here we go.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.335
-[Archie] Backstabber.
-Dude, what is this?

02:08.378 --> 02:09.963
"Worst town in America."

02:11.047 --> 02:12.674
Seriously?

02:12.715 --> 02:15.468
After we busted our asses
saving Riverdale from Hiram,

02:15.510 --> 02:17.345
why would you publish
something like this?

02:17.387 --> 02:20.807
The Riverdale Choice
is a free press that believes

02:20.849 --> 02:22.142
in critical points of view.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.393
Who?

02:23.434 --> 02:24.394
Who wrote this?

02:24.435 --> 02:25.728
Why would I tell you that?

02:25.770 --> 02:27.188
So you can beat them up?

02:27.230 --> 02:28.356
[Archie] Yeah,
you're freaking right.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.274
Of course not.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.819
Okay, Look, you have
a different point of view.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.445
That's great.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.947
Let me interview you.
I'll publish it next week.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.407
No, screw that.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.993
I've already talked
to Alice and Frank.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.996
They're calling a town hall
meeting so everyone can respond
to this garbage in person.

02:44.789 --> 02:45.999
And you better be there
covering it.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.003
[sighs]

02:50.044 --> 02:51.838
Grand Mistress Rose.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.506
I shouldn't be here,

02:53.548 --> 02:57.218
but Mistress Abigail
is getting ready to go out and

02:57.260 --> 03:00.054
we have to figure out a way
to get Mistress Cheryl back.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.599
Cheryl is gone.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.475
Vanished into the void.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.186
No,

03:06.227 --> 03:08.313
I saw her in a mirror
that Abigail was looking into.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.607
[inaudible]

03:10.648 --> 03:12.025
I think she's still
in her body,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.319
somewhere.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.863
Well, if that were the case,
it would mean

03:16.905 --> 03:19.073
Abigail's keeping her
locked away,

03:20.825 --> 03:23.036
imprisoned in a kind of

03:23.077 --> 03:24.204
mental jail.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.830
Oh, my God.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.500
Is there some way
that we can reach Cheryl?

03:29.542 --> 03:30.919
Make contact with her.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.379
Well, the only way
to do that would be

03:34.172 --> 03:36.090
when Abigail

03:36.132 --> 03:38.718
is in a deep sleep,

03:38.760 --> 03:43.848
and you would need to be
in a deep slumber near to her.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.560
I mean, Abigail once
inhabited your body.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.646
You could use that tether

03:49.687 --> 03:53.358
to enter and walk
her dreamscape.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.442
And perhaps

03:55.151 --> 03:56.152
find Cheryl.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.112
If she exists.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.615
I could drug her tea.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.658
Be warned.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.370
If you try this,

04:05.411 --> 04:09.415
you must awaken
before Abigail does.

04:10.166 --> 04:14.003
Or risk her wrath.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.425
[Penelope] Jason.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.593
Cheryl.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.429
My little darlings.

04:23.471 --> 04:27.267
I have decided
to throw you a birthday party.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.851
Isn't that grand?

04:28.893 --> 04:31.271
I've even invited
all your little friends

04:31.312 --> 04:33.690
from school and church
and the community.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.774
Including Heather?

04:34.816 --> 04:37.402
No, not that two-bit trollop.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.904
But everybody else.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.364
Now,

04:41.406 --> 04:43.199
what do you say?

04:43.241 --> 04:44.909
Thank you, dearest Mumsy.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.579
You're very, very welcome,
my precious little angels.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.631
[all clamoring]

05:02.885 --> 05:04.804
[woman 1]
Who wrote the article?
Probably Alice.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.681
[man]
This town is going to hell
in a handbasket.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.100
-[woman 2 voice] Maybe,
I should move.
-All right.

05:09.142 --> 05:13.646
All right, I'm sure everyone
has read the article written
by our mysterious author.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.940
And, yes, there is a lot
to dispute.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.652
But not the fact that
we do have an illegal casino

05:19.694 --> 05:22.989
operating covertly
and corruptly
within our town limits.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.824
If I may.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.870
Babylonium's employees
are all citizens of Riverdale

05:28.911 --> 05:31.664
who are paid
a generous living wage.

05:31.706 --> 05:35.668
Also, we have the potential
to bring in out-of-towners.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.754
Guests who would spend

05:37.795 --> 05:40.214
fresh cash across all
of our businesses.

05:40.256 --> 05:44.385
Nice try, Veronica,
but we all know who truly
profits from a casino.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.887
It's its owners.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.597
And I mean,
when is the last time a Lodge

05:47.638 --> 05:49.474
has done anything good
for this town?

05:50.475 --> 05:51.726
What the hell does that mean?

05:51.768 --> 05:53.811
I think you know exactly
what that means.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.733
Can we cut
to the damn chase here?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.235
Who wrote that article?

06:02.111 --> 06:04.447
Oh, come on.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.574
Whoever it is, if you're going
to attack our town,

06:06.616 --> 06:08.076
at least have the guts
to own it.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.369
[man] It was me.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.913
I wrote it.
I wrote the article.

06:11.954 --> 06:15.041
I-- I know I should have
had the courage
to put my name on it.

06:15.083 --> 06:20.088
I guess I was just concerned
that if you saw the name
Pickens on the byline, then,

06:20.129 --> 06:22.006
you'd dismiss my words
out of hand

06:22.048 --> 06:24.467
because of what
my great-great grandfather did.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.136
You mean a genocide
against my ancestors?

06:27.178 --> 06:30.264
Yeah,
that's a strike against you.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.558
I'm sorry,
you've been living here,
what, four days?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.060
And we're supposed
to care what you think?

06:34.102 --> 06:36.813
Well, sometimes it takes
a recent arrival

06:36.854 --> 06:38.648
to see what's really wrong
with the town.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.358
Yeah, well, all I see,

06:40.400 --> 06:43.027
is a Johnny-come-lately
talking trash about our town

06:43.069 --> 06:44.695
without offering
any real solutions.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.031
But I do have solutions.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.032
If you're open to hearing them.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.700
Buddy, I'm open

06:49.742 --> 06:51.953
to resolving this outside,
You and me, right now.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.037
Okay, Archie.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.958
We do need
to let Mr. Pickens speak.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.127
Oh, with a town that's

06:59.168 --> 07:01.546
in such dire straits
as Riverdale,
where do you even begin?

07:02.463 --> 07:03.965
I know.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.175
The homeless encampment
you call "Sketch Alley."

07:07.552 --> 07:09.137
Poverty

07:09.178 --> 07:11.806
begets more poverty,
begets drugs, begets crime,

07:11.848 --> 07:13.516
begets more crime
until no one is safe.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.184
-[indistinct chatter]
-[woman] Yeah.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.228
I'm sorry, but the homeless
have got to be bussed out

07:17.270 --> 07:20.648
as quickly and humanely
as possible.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.108
-[woman 1] He's right.
-[man 1] I agree.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.609
[woman 2] The homeless
are a problem.

07:23.651 --> 07:24.944
[man 2] About time
someone said it.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.738
We can't just bus them
out of town.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.284
And I'm sorry,
but that's... not who we are,
and it's not what we do.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.286
Riverdale takes care
of their own.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.455
And the people that live
in Sketch Alley,

07:35.496 --> 07:39.834
are citizens of this town
just as much as all of us.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.419
We need to show them
that we care.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.714
In that case,
you've heard my recommendation.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.633
But we're all ears,
Mr. Andrews.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.719
What's yours?

07:54.891 --> 07:57.727
[Jughead]
And thus began the battle
for Riverdale's soul.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.237
[door opens]

08:08.279 --> 08:10.448
Mistress Abigail, you're home.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.159
-How was the town hall?
-Delightsome.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.536
Also, a bit of gossip.

08:15.578 --> 08:19.165
T'was Percival Pickens,
who wrote that screed
against the town of Riverdale.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.417
He may prove an ally to me.

08:21.459 --> 08:25.713
But first, me thinks I must
acquaint myself with
the history of Riverdale

08:25.755 --> 08:29.634
and the role
the Pickens family played
in its shaping.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.511
I think I saw a book
in the Thornhill library.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.180
I'll fetch it for you,
Mistress Abigail.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.182
I've just brewed you some tea.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.684
Why don't you retire
to your room and
I'll bring both up to you?

08:47.151 --> 08:48.611
[Jughead] Don't punch me.

08:49.987 --> 08:52.114
I should, you know.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.910
Look, Archie, I'm a journalist.
I'm supposed
to remain impartial. But,

08:55.952 --> 08:58.246
I heard what you said
at the town hall.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.373
And for what it's worth,
I agree with you.

09:00.414 --> 09:03.292
I think bussing
the unhoused out of Riverdale
is not a solution.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.377
I know those people.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.673
At times I was one of them

09:08.714 --> 09:11.634
and they've always helped me
when I was in trouble.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.636
They're good people.
They need our resources.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.346
Could've said that
at the meeting.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.931
I will, at the next one,
once you present your big idea.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.058
Well...

09:20.518 --> 09:21.394
I...

09:22.228 --> 09:23.145
I don't have one yet.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.481
That's okay.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.358
I did some research of my own
after the last meeting.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.318
A lot of cities,
they're--they're building
these micro homes.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.279
They're basically cabins,
right?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.281
They have a shower
and a toilet and a bed.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.866
Imagine if we did that.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.119
We build one of these homes
for every unhoused person

09:38.160 --> 09:40.871
living in a cardboard box
or a tent on the alley.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.873
We?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.458
You're the only person
I know that has
a construction business.

09:47.962 --> 09:48.963
All right.

09:50.089 --> 09:50.965
Let's do this.

09:51.882 --> 09:52.883
Let's try.

10:03.019 --> 10:03.978
[door knob clicks]

10:07.398 --> 10:08.608
Oh, perfect.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.193
Sweet dreams, Abigail.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.325
And hopefully for me, too.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.576
[timer beeps]

10:33.841 --> 10:35.676
[children laughing]

10:43.768 --> 10:46.312
[indistinct laughter]

10:52.360 --> 10:54.570
[Penelope] How are you liking
that cake?

10:54.612 --> 10:58.282
Vanilla, your favorite.
Just as requested.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.535
Excuse me.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.539
I'm looking for Cheryl Blossom.

11:06.707 --> 11:07.750
Who the hell are you?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.251
I'm...

11:10.628 --> 11:11.879
a friend of hers.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.589
Is Cheryl not here?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.007
Well, she's right over there.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.011
Facing the wall as punishment
for being

11:19.053 --> 11:21.972
such a selfish,
ungrateful brat.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.398
But...

11:30.439 --> 11:32.066
it's her birthday,
too, isn't it?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.317
Not this year.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.612
Not the way
she's been behaving.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.282
Will she get her presents,
at least?

11:40.324 --> 11:42.576
Absolutely not.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.996
Now, who did you say you were?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.545
[alarm beeping]

11:57.842 --> 11:59.009
[beeping stops]

12:20.156 --> 12:21.490
Reggie.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.492
We haven't talked
about it too much but,

12:23.534 --> 12:26.495
I've always assumed
we'd be sort of

12:26.537 --> 12:29.832
gaming the system
with the casino.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.377
You know, doing our usual
side hustles and scams.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.213
I made the same assumptions.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.506
What if we

12:38.132 --> 12:39.341
didn't?

12:39.383 --> 12:41.260
Does that mean no scams?

12:41.302 --> 12:42.928
No scams,

12:42.970 --> 12:44.889
no side deals, no loopholes,

12:44.930 --> 12:47.266
no tax evasion.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.226
What if we proved Alice

12:49.268 --> 12:55.232
and the haters wrong
and operated completely
above board?

12:55.274 --> 12:59.862
I just buried my father,
Reggie. Let's start
a new chapter and

12:59.904 --> 13:02.865
rehabilitate the Lodge name.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.786
Instead of the council
fighting us at every turn,
we lock arms with them,

13:06.827 --> 13:09.997
help fix the town my dad broke.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.125
I like it in theory, Ronnie.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.835
But the first thing is

13:14.877 --> 13:17.004
we'd have to get our licenses
and permits in order.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.216
Okay.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.469
Is that a problem?

13:23.511 --> 13:26.806
No, it's just very expensive.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.224
Let's pull the trigger, Reggie.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.481
And let's hang
my father's portrait
right up here.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.695
As a constant reminder
of who we're not
going to be like.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.867
I don't disagree
with what you're saying,
Mr. Pickens.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.869
Oh, please, call me Percival.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.914
Percival,

13:51.956 --> 13:54.250
I just don't want to
come down on either side
of the issue

13:54.291 --> 13:57.711
until Archie has had a chance
to present his solutions.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.339
Of course, not. Alice...

14:00.381 --> 14:01.674
Sorry, may I call you Alice?

14:02.383 --> 14:03.551
Yes.

14:03.592 --> 14:04.510
Thank you.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.430
It's just I

14:08.472 --> 14:11.350
assumed that you would have

14:11.392 --> 14:14.436
a personal stake
in making Riverdale safer

14:15.938 --> 14:17.565
given what happened
to your daughter.

14:18.941 --> 14:19.817
Polly.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.534
All right, people,
let's call this meeting
to order.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.537
Our proposal for
the town's future
is simple.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.122
Reginald?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.543
Riverdale,
the new Atlantic city.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.921
Instead of the town
and the casino being at odds
with each other,

14:40.963 --> 14:43.007
why not work together

14:43.048 --> 14:47.511
and rebrand
as a family-friendly,
destination hotspot?

14:48.262 --> 14:49.597
Let Babylonium

14:49.638 --> 14:52.182
be the solution
to lifting Riverdale up.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.475
So, what,

14:53.517 --> 14:55.269
children can gamble now,
is that it?

14:55.311 --> 14:58.230
We would open an arcade,
provide daycare.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.149
Here's my problem
with the casino.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.192
Riverdale has a lot of
broken people.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.695
Including veterans
like myself and Archie.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.157
And a casino just isn't
a healthy environment
for people like that.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.702
You raise a valid point, Frank.
Let's have that dialogue.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.912
But not today.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.496
We have your proposal,
Veronica.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.123
We will look it over
and get back to you.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.667
In the meantime,
if we catch one whiff

15:18.709 --> 15:20.961
of any trouble coming
from your casino,

15:21.003 --> 15:24.214
then any partnership
would be immediately untenable.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.966
Great.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.052
Thank you, Team Babylonium.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.349
So, the spaces are
eight feet wide.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.936
They house one to two people,
and they can be locked which

15:36.977 --> 15:39.813
helps give the occupants
a sense of ownership
and security.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.982
And not to mention,

15:42.024 --> 15:44.693
all of the labor, will be
provided free of charge
by Andrews Construction.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.196
This is a strong,
simple and smart idea, Archie.

15:47.237 --> 15:51.158
Yeah, they have
these mini-houses in Chicago,
and they are game changing.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.994
-[Frank] Awesome.
-Yeah. So to start, I was
thinking around 30.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.955
Thirty houses?

15:55.996 --> 15:58.123
Uh, how much do
these things cost?

15:58.165 --> 16:01.877
Well, like I said, Alice,
the labor will be free,
but with materials,

16:01.919 --> 16:03.796
I'm thinking around 20, 25.

16:03.837 --> 16:06.757
Thousand for each house?

16:06.799 --> 16:11.387
Oh, no. Uh,
Riverdale can't afford this.
We'd have to raise taxes.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.972
[woman 1]
More taxes? No way.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.598
[man] We can barely pay
our mortgage.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.100
[woman 2] Just make
the problem go away.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.310
[woman 3] I agree
with that British dude.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.688
Well, I feel it's my civic duty
at this point
to point out that, uh,

16:20.729 --> 16:23.649
my straightforward proposal
would cost the people of
Riverdale virtually nothing,

16:23.691 --> 16:26.443
and could be carried
out immediately.

16:26.485 --> 16:30.614
We like the vision, Archie.
At least, most of us do.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.493
We just need to figure out
a way to fund it.

16:34.535 --> 16:38.330
And if you could show us
proof of concept,
that would be super helpful.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.082
Yeah, for sure.
I'll figure something out.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.208
I appreciate your time.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.129
Thanks for staying behind
to chat.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.089
Not at all.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.966
I welcome any opportunity
to get to know
my neighbors better.

16:49.008 --> 16:49.967
Yeah, me, too.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.804
-So, you're English?
-Indeed.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.807
Some of the Pickens family
came to the States
to settle in the colonies,

16:56.849 --> 16:59.810
others stayed behind
in the old country.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.687
Is that where you were
before you came to Riverdale?

17:02.229 --> 17:03.188
Oh, no.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.484
I was traveling here and there.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.821
Nowhere with the potential
of this place, though.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.450
Do you know I think
with a spot of investment
and a little bit of hard work,

17:14.491 --> 17:16.285
this place could be
the next Marsha's Vineyard.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.205
Look, maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.333
We both want the same thing.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.419
A better, safer Riverdale.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.629
And can't we

17:27.671 --> 17:29.256
align on this idea
about the houses?

17:29.298 --> 17:31.550
Don't see that happening,
Mr. Andrews.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.095
Because, if you don't mind
my saying, you're thinking
is fundamentally flawed.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.138
And I'll tell you why.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.807
One.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.810
People of Sketch Alley
don't want your help.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.479
All they want are handouts.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.731
And if you try
and lift them up,
all they'll do is

17:45.773 --> 17:48.567
bring you and your
property values down.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.322
And number two, at the risk
of disillusioning you further,

17:55.199 --> 17:58.410
your neighbors
don't want them here.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.580
Oh, they'll say
they're good,
liberal people but,

18:01.622 --> 18:03.791
in their heart of hearts,

18:03.832 --> 18:05.000
what they really want

18:06.126 --> 18:09.213
is for the poor,
the destitute,

18:09.254 --> 18:11.673
and the smelly to go away

18:11.715 --> 18:13.675
without compromising
their own comfort.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.677
You're wrong.

18:18.555 --> 18:22.893
And so is your warped,
cynical idea of who we are.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.771
I'll prove it to you.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.439
Well, I don't think so but...

18:29.358 --> 18:30.526
let's see.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.909
You called this meeting.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.202
What can we do for you,
Archie?

18:40.244 --> 18:41.411
[Archie]
You're both on the council.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.455
But I'm here appealing
to you

18:43.497 --> 18:46.708
as two of the most
prominent business owners
in Riverdale.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.960
I need your personal help.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.837
Okay.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.713
We're listening.

18:51.755 --> 18:55.050
Would you each
be willing to underwrite
one of the houses?

18:55.092 --> 18:58.345
I was thinking after
I finished building them,
we could paint them.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.890
One like Pop's and one like
the Whyte Wyrm.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.351
In a way,
they'd be like billboards.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.187
And you're sure you don't mind
that I'm a quote unquote,
gang member?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.731
Oh, come on. No.
Not at all.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.650
Where would you set them up
and build them?

19:11.692 --> 19:14.278
I was hoping we could
set them up
in the parking lot.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.113
That way, the folks living
in them could feel more

19:16.155 --> 19:17.865
a part of the town's
daily life.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.577
Yeah, of course, Archie,
we're in.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.828
Great.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.413
And as for
where we build them,

19:24.454 --> 19:25.956
I was thinking
we could do that
in Sketch Alley.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.668
[Jughead] Doc.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.587
-[Doc] Hey!
-How have you been?

19:33.672 --> 19:36.091
Ah, I'm surviving.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.218
Well, you look a lot better
than the last time I saw you.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.387
And that's thanks to you.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.389
That's the reason
we're here too.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.682
Wanted to repay the favor.

19:43.724 --> 19:44.892
I mean,
if you're cool with it.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.935
This is my pal Archie.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.479
And the rest of us
were hoping to build
some houses for you guys.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.356
One for each of you.

19:51.398 --> 19:55.319
-Houses?
-They're small,
but they're swanky.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.279
If you guys want to help out,
that's great.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.489
If not, we just wanted
to let you know
what we are up to.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.824
All good either way.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.576
When do we start?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.036
-How about right now?
-[Doc] All right.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.880
[Reggie] We've got a problem.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.132
I've been crunching numbers,
and given all of our start up
costs, our expenses,

20:17.174 --> 20:18.592
not to mention permit costs--

20:18.634 --> 20:19.801
Cut to the chase, Reggie.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.054
We're overleveraged, Ronnie.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.264
Majorly.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.559
If we're strictly legit,
it's going to be impossible
for us to turn a profit.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.602
Maybe ever.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.022
Unless.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.858
Don't say it.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.277
We start running scams,
which we could do.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.612
[knock on door]

20:38.654 --> 20:40.822
[man]
Uh, Miss Lodge, Mr. Mantle.

20:40.864 --> 20:45.410
I apologize, but you've got
to come to the private
gambling room now.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.120
What is it? Something bad?

20:47.746 --> 20:48.622
Yeah.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.542
[both exclaiming]

20:55.587 --> 20:56.713
Oh, my God.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.092
[Reggie] What should we do?

21:00.133 --> 21:01.677
Cut him down?
Call the ambulance?

21:01.718 --> 21:04.513
That's what a legit place
would do, right? Right?

21:04.554 --> 21:07.766
Yes, yes. But we don't
have that luxury, Reggie.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.352
This would be a horrible
news story if it broke.

21:10.394 --> 21:14.231
It would confirm Alice
and the council's worst fear
about this place

21:14.273 --> 21:16.566
and Babylonium would be over
before it even began.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.361
Wait.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.822
I know who could help.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.241
Abuelita's iceman.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.636
Mistress Cheryl, it's me.

21:44.678 --> 21:45.637
Britta.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.142
You have to wake up.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.727
Please.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.564
What is it, Brittania?

21:55.605 --> 21:57.816
[Penelope] Wake up.
Time to rise and shine.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.526
Time to get out of bed,
you lazy bones.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.862
It's dearest Mumsy.
You have to hide.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.697
If she finds you,
I don't know what she'll do.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.906
Now!

22:04.948 --> 22:06.658
[footsteps approaching]

22:06.700 --> 22:09.578
Wake up, devil children!

22:09.619 --> 22:11.997
Mumsy? What's going on?
It's the middle of the night.

22:12.039 --> 22:15.542
Doesn't matter.
This place,
this whole house is a sty.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.879
Now, you grab that bucket
and a brush and
you get to work, piggies.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.881
[Cheryl and Jason]
Yes, dearest Mumsy.

22:20.922 --> 22:25.552
Get on your hand and knees
and you scrub that floor
till it's clean!

22:25.594 --> 22:28.138
I want to be able
to eat off of it.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.056
[scrubbing]

22:31.058 --> 22:33.352
What are you doing?
Why aren't you working?

22:33.393 --> 22:35.312
You get back to work.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.565
Or I will get
the hanger to you.
Don't make me hurt you!

22:38.607 --> 22:39.775
[gasping]

22:46.281 --> 22:47.574
[hammering]

23:00.003 --> 23:02.339
[suspenseful music playing]

23:08.261 --> 23:10.806
Hey, it's Doc, right?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.811
Do you need something?

23:21.316 --> 23:22.859
[groans]

23:27.739 --> 23:29.282
And what did our young
Kevin Keller get

23:29.324 --> 23:30.867
in exchange for wanting
to provide shelter

23:30.909 --> 23:32.536
to the people of Sketch Alley?

23:32.577 --> 23:37.249
A hammer to the skull
is what he got.

23:37.290 --> 23:40.419
This vicious attack
is a clear indication

23:40.460 --> 23:42.587
that these people
don't want our help.

23:42.629 --> 23:46.508
You offer them a helping hand
and they respond with violence.

23:46.550 --> 23:50.303
Well, this journalist
and town council member

23:50.345 --> 23:52.472
says, no more--

23:52.514 --> 23:53.807
[Archie sighs]

23:55.976 --> 23:57.936
How is Kevin doing?

23:57.978 --> 23:59.604
I just came from the hospital.

23:59.646 --> 24:00.856
He's gonna be okay.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.607
This is a mess, Archie.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.734
Believe me, I know, Toni.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.945
These houses are going
to be painted
with our businesses on them.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.322
If they're associated
with violence and crime...

24:09.364 --> 24:11.491
I know.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.702
And I know that article
didn't exactly
do the Serpents any favors.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.162
It did not.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.830
But you still have
our financial support.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.915
So, maybe
just hold off a beat

24:18.957 --> 24:21.626
before you paint it
to match the Whyte Wyrm.

24:21.668 --> 24:22.919
Yeah, that makes sense.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.504
Thanks for the support, Toni.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.964
Yeah, no problem.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.883
I'll send you my payment
on Chime right now.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.593
-[phone chimes]
-Cool.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.553
[clicks tongue]
How about you, Tabitha?

24:32.179 --> 24:33.513
I am...

24:33.555 --> 24:34.681
[inhales]

24:34.723 --> 24:36.808
still in, Archie. [exhales]

24:36.850 --> 24:39.853
Paint job and all. So...

24:39.895 --> 24:41.980
When do you want to set up
the first house?

24:42.022 --> 24:43.940
Well, I'll bring it by
in my truck later today.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.360
Thank you, guys.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.862
[Veronica] Talk to me, Reggie.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.363
So I figured, that dead guy
must have been

24:50.405 --> 24:52.032
on a major losing streak,
and that's why he--

24:52.073 --> 24:53.074
Killed himself.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.326
Sadly, that makes sense.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.537
But, no.
He was winning big-time.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.999
So, I called
the blackjack dealer and
pulled the security footage.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.005
He was on top of the world,
up almost 20 grand.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.716
Why would a guy
who's winning every hand
suddenly just...

25:10.926 --> 25:12.093
off himself?

25:12.135 --> 25:14.095
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop the tape.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.474
Look.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.310
Who the hell is that?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.270
That's the British creep
from Town Hall,

25:22.312 --> 25:25.398
Percival Pickens.
What the hell is he saying?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.322
[man] Miss Lodge, I'm here.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.952
Heraldo, thank you so much
for coming so speedily.

25:36.993 --> 25:37.994
Where's the body?

25:38.036 --> 25:40.664
Jeez. Cut to the chase much?

25:40.705 --> 25:42.707
Downstairs. I'll take you.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.626
[Reggie exhales]

25:44.668 --> 25:46.586
[Britta] Grand Mistress Rose,
it's gotten so much worse.

25:46.628 --> 25:50.757
Mistress Cheryl's mother
is torturing her
in every way imaginable.

25:50.799 --> 25:54.135
Penelope has always been
Cheryl's tormentor.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.805
So, of course,
Abigail would have conjured her

25:56.846 --> 26:00.350
as my granddaughter's adversary
in the dreamscape.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.977
She's terrifying.

26:02.018 --> 26:06.856
You must tell Cheryl that
Penelope is but a fiction.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.943
A bogeyman pulled
from her own subconscious.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.612
That perhaps will
shake her free of her stupor

26:12.654 --> 26:14.155
and spur her into action.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.075
Else, Abigail may take

26:17.117 --> 26:19.911
permanent possession
of my granddaughter's body.

26:19.953 --> 26:23.999
But I never even get
the chance to talk to her
before the nightmare...

26:24.040 --> 26:26.209
Penelope descends on us.

26:26.251 --> 26:31.423
Then perhaps, child,
you must divine a better way
to communicate with her.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.722
Gentlemen, I am so sorry
to intrude.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.390
May I come in?

26:41.141 --> 26:42.100
Yeah.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.569
I heard all about
what happened
in Sketch Alley. And...

26:53.737 --> 26:54.988
I wanted to talk to you.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.993
In hopes it never
happens again.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.125
Well, what do
you think, Tabitha?

27:07.167 --> 27:10.170
I think
it is beautiful, Archie.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.213
[Archie]
Well, it was a group effort.

27:12.255 --> 27:16.051
And bonus, Benjamin Moore
donated the paint
for future houses, too.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.594
I think
it's a great start, Arch.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.475
[closes zipper]

27:25.226 --> 27:27.771
You're good. [exhales]
I can take it from here.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.981
What are you gonna do?

27:30.023 --> 27:32.901
[Heraldo] After dark,
I'll put him in his car,
drive into Jersey,

27:32.942 --> 27:35.779
hang him up in
the bathroom of a rest stop
with no cameras,

27:35.820 --> 27:36.696
call it in.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.658
How are things going otherwise?

27:39.699 --> 27:40.575
How's business?

27:41.284 --> 27:42.994
Slow.

27:43.036 --> 27:46.331
We're not quite the sensation
we were hoping we'd be.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.083
You know, if you want,

27:48.124 --> 27:50.460
I could put the word out
to some wise guys I know.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.046
They got money,

27:53.088 --> 27:55.090
and they like spending it.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.927
I appreciate the offer,
and no offense
to your wise guys, but...

27:58.968 --> 28:02.597
we're trying to avoid that,
if at all possible.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.598
No worries, just...

28:04.349 --> 28:05.266
trying to help.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.561
Actually, you know
what you could do?

28:09.813 --> 28:12.190
Could you look
into someone for me?

28:12.232 --> 28:14.818
His name's Percival Pickens.
He's British.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.736
Just got into town and...

28:16.778 --> 28:18.655
there's something off
about him.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.408
And I want to know what.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.409
Yeah, I can do that.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.540
[clattering]

28:30.709 --> 28:32.001
[cell phone buzzing]

28:34.003 --> 28:35.922
Hey, Tabitha. What's up?

28:39.676 --> 28:40.635
I'm on my way.

28:49.436 --> 28:50.437
What the hell!

29:09.539 --> 29:10.874
Oh, Doc.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.752
Why did you do that to Kevin?

29:13.793 --> 29:15.420
I have no idea.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.131
I have absolutely no memory
of attacking your friend.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.591
Well, you did.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.468
[stammering] One minute,
I'm hammering and...

29:21.509 --> 29:24.721
[panting] and the next minute,
I'm just...

29:24.763 --> 29:26.973
standing over your friend.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.808
Getting ready to take
another swipe at him.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.562
You gotta believe me, Jughead.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.273
It was...

29:35.315 --> 29:37.358
...like someone
put the idea in my head.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.652
Who?

29:41.988 --> 29:43.531
Who could have done that?

29:43.573 --> 29:45.241
[Doc] He, uh...

29:45.283 --> 29:46.618
had an accent.

29:46.659 --> 29:47.744
He might have
had a British accent.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.124
[Jughead] Thank you again,
for agreeing to meet with me.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.919
Like I mentioned,
I would love to do
a follow up article

29:55.960 --> 29:57.253
to the one that you wrote.

29:57.295 --> 30:00.048
[stammers] Something like
a rebuttal.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.884
[scoffs]
Well, to each his own.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.678
I've been thinking about
this quote that I read.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.639
"The true measure
of any society

30:07.680 --> 30:10.391
"can be found
in how it treats its most
vulnerable members."

30:10.433 --> 30:13.228
Well, whoever said that
obviously didn't grow up
in Riverdale.

30:13.269 --> 30:14.312
It's Gandhi.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.440
So tell me, Percival,

30:17.482 --> 30:20.443
do you really think that
bussing the unhoused
out of Riverdale

30:20.485 --> 30:22.987
is the best that
we can muster as a society?

30:23.029 --> 30:24.823
Well, as I mentioned before,

30:24.864 --> 30:27.617
I am coming at this
from a place of compassion.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.702
My main concern is for the

30:29.744 --> 30:31.830
[echoing]
the law-abiding citizens
of Riverdale, those who pay

30:31.871 --> 30:35.875
their taxes and contribute
to the betterment
of our society.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.837
[echoing]
Now, I've been to several
Sketch Alleys in my time.

30:38.878 --> 30:42.674
The truth is, charity
is doing them a disservice.

30:42.715 --> 30:45.969
As is giving them a handout
when what they really
should be doing

30:46.010 --> 30:48.388
is fending for themselves.

30:48.429 --> 30:52.725
Tell me, are you having fun
rooting around
inside my brain, Mr. Jones?

30:52.767 --> 30:54.602
What?

30:54.644 --> 30:56.312
[Percival] Get out of my head,
you piece of garbage!

30:58.857 --> 31:01.359
Are you all right, Mr. Jones?

31:01.401 --> 31:03.820
Did I not answer the question
to your satisfaction?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.625
[suspenseful music playing]

31:28.136 --> 31:30.597
[woman sobbing]

31:30.638 --> 31:32.015
Mistress Cheryl?

31:32.056 --> 31:33.725
Is that you?

31:35.476 --> 31:37.395
[Cheryl sobbing]
It's me. I'm here.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.444
Mistress Cheryl, what happened
to your beautiful hair?

31:45.194 --> 31:47.739
Mumsy, of course.

31:47.780 --> 31:50.283
She cut it off
when she saw me
with my friend...

31:52.243 --> 31:53.703
Heather.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.623
Please, Mistress Cheryl,
you have to listen to me.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.917
This isn't happening.
You're in a dreamscape.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.085
Your mother
isn't actually here.

32:01.127 --> 32:03.546
What?
[scoffs] Of course, she is.

32:03.588 --> 32:04.631
No.

32:04.672 --> 32:06.257
It's hard to explain.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.051
I have written down
everything you need to know.

32:08.092 --> 32:10.553
[Penelope shouting]
What is going on here?

32:10.595 --> 32:12.555
Unbelievable.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.849
I catch you
with one sapphic slut,

32:14.891 --> 32:17.602
and not an hour later,
you're back with another one.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.940
Whomever you are,
you should be ashamed.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.441
Screw you.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.485
You're not even real,
Mrs. Blossom.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.946
[gasps] How dare you?

32:27.987 --> 32:31.324
Get out of Thornhill.
You don't belong here.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.124
Please, Mrs. Blossom--

32:40.166 --> 32:42.835
Don't you show your face
in this house again.

32:42.877 --> 32:43.795
[door slams]

32:48.424 --> 32:51.094
[breathing heavily]

32:51.135 --> 32:56.015
[Britta] Mistress Cheryl,
the world you are currently
inhabiting is not reality,

32:56.057 --> 32:59.018
but rather a hellish dreamscape
from which we must free you.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.020
Your physical body
is currently possessed

33:01.062 --> 33:03.147
by the spirit
of Abigail Blossom.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.732
And she has trapped you
in a prison
in your own mind...

33:04.774 --> 33:06.317
[Abigail grunting]

33:06.359 --> 33:07.860
...with Penelope
as your cruel warden.

33:07.902 --> 33:10.822
But she is not real,
Mistress Cheryl.

33:10.863 --> 33:12.824
And you must not let her
dominate you.

33:12.865 --> 33:14.492
Do not let her
break your spirit.

33:14.534 --> 33:17.078
For if she does, your soul
may wither and dissipate

33:17.120 --> 33:19.163
within the confines
of your corporeal body.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.791
She is but a ghost.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.168
A creation of the imagination.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.878
You can defeat her.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.547
[footsteps approaching]

33:27.588 --> 33:32.635
I am gonna beat you to
within an inch of your life,

33:32.677 --> 33:36.264
you deviant,
wretched creature!

33:39.058 --> 33:41.728
Why are you looking
at me like that,

33:41.769 --> 33:44.147
you shameless, little wretch?

33:44.188 --> 33:46.983
Because I know
the truth now, Mumsy.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.068
You're not real.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.695
Is that a fact?

33:51.362 --> 33:52.739
Yes.

33:52.780 --> 33:56.117
You're in my mind,
you psychotic bitch.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.037
And you shouldn't be here.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.042
[tires screech]

34:09.255 --> 34:11.424
What are you guys doing?

34:11.466 --> 34:13.301
I'm here
to break that house down
and haul it away.

34:14.469 --> 34:15.762
No, you're not.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.847
Tabitha called us, Archie.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.349
We started a project,
and we're doubling down
to finish it.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.269
And a few hours later,
someone will have
vandalized them again.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.605
Then, we will repaint them.

34:25.646 --> 34:28.357
And again, and again.
As many times as we have to.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.609
Why don't you grab a brush?

34:30.485 --> 34:31.444
It's cold out.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.405
I do need to talk to you
about something, though.

34:36.115 --> 34:37.742
I don't think Doc was the one
that attacked Kevin.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.368
Who else would it have been?

34:39.410 --> 34:40.661
[Percival] Hello, there.

34:40.703 --> 34:42.121
Now what are you folks doing?

34:43.831 --> 34:45.416
My goodness,
aren't those charming houses?

34:47.418 --> 34:48.753
No need for them
anymore, though.

34:50.129 --> 34:51.589
Sketch Alley
is no longer an issue.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.008
Meaning what?

34:54.050 --> 34:56.344
I took it upon myself
to visit Sketch Alley.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.429
I spoke to the people
living there, and...

34:59.305 --> 35:01.474
got them to move on.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.977
Leave town,
start over somewhere else.

35:05.019 --> 35:06.938
And how did you do that?

35:06.979 --> 35:09.315
Call it
the power of persuasion.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.736
I also bought them
bus tickets, and...

35:13.778 --> 35:17.198
gave them each $100
to build new lives elsewhere.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.241
I don't believe you.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.702
Well, see for yourselves.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.871
Then afterwards, hopefully,
see you at the town hall.

35:25.289 --> 35:26.541
Keep up the good work.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.547
[suspenseful music playing]

35:53.609 --> 35:54.735
Mistress Cheryl?

35:55.736 --> 35:57.321
You're alive?

35:57.363 --> 36:01.033
I am. And visiting you
in your dreams, Brittania.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.702
You've done well.

36:02.743 --> 36:06.914
And proven yourself
a dutiful and loyal factotum.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.542
For that, you will be rewarded.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.920
But only after we have driven
that she-demon Abigail
out of my beautiful body.

36:13.838 --> 36:14.797
How will we do that?

36:16.090 --> 36:17.717
I haven't the faintest idea.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.434
Please, please, please.
Thank you.

36:26.475 --> 36:29.937
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

36:29.979 --> 36:32.356
Uh, the town of Riverdale
can breathe a little easier,

36:32.398 --> 36:35.234
now that the denizens
of Sketch Alley

36:35.276 --> 36:36.652
are on their way
to a better place.

36:40.239 --> 36:43.284
The idea to pay
their location costs
may have been mine,

36:43.326 --> 36:46.913
but I, um,
couldn't have pulled it off
without the help

36:46.954 --> 36:51.542
of your sheriff, Tom Keller,
a man who represents
the very best of Riverdale.

36:53.377 --> 36:54.503
Keeping with the good news,

36:54.545 --> 36:56.339
I'm also pleased
to announce that

36:56.380 --> 36:59.050
Percival will be joining
my department.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.384
And he'll be working
as a deputy

37:00.426 --> 37:03.471
along with me and my son
to keep the peace

37:03.512 --> 37:05.973
and fulfill the promise
of Riverdale

37:06.015 --> 37:08.267
that has eluded us for so long.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.569
[Archie]
Dude's like a super villain.

37:20.529 --> 37:21.614
That's exactly what he is.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.577
We seriously need
to talk tonight. Okay?

37:30.206 --> 37:32.792
[Veronica] Alice.

37:32.833 --> 37:37.171
In all the excitement,
the casino
didn't even come up.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.340
Yeah, have you looked
over our proposal, or what?

37:40.091 --> 37:42.009
I have.

37:42.051 --> 37:45.972
And after careful review
and some solid advice
from Percival,

37:46.013 --> 37:50.935
the council believes
that there's a lot of risk in
partnering with Babylonium.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.688
Which could be
mitigated, possibly.

37:53.729 --> 37:56.899
But quite frankly, Veronica,
the biggest liability is you.

37:58.150 --> 38:00.569
Me?

38:00.611 --> 38:05.908
The Lodge name is synonymous
with crime and corruption
because of Hiram.

38:05.950 --> 38:10.162
You're its figurehead,
the public face.

38:10.204 --> 38:13.666
So, the council feels
that we could really
only support the casino

38:13.708 --> 38:17.044
and this idea of it becoming
the new Atlantic City,

38:17.086 --> 38:19.755
is if you take a back seat.
Out of the limelight.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.882
[scoffs]

38:21.924 --> 38:25.511
Alice, I am not my father.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.096
-[scoffs]
-In fact, I've worked

38:27.138 --> 38:29.473
really, really hard
to not be like my father--

38:29.515 --> 38:31.350
Take offense or not, Veronica,

38:31.392 --> 38:33.477
but I'd like to see you
do this
without our support.

38:34.812 --> 38:37.773
The picketing,
the bad publicity,

38:37.815 --> 38:39.859
the complaints
to the gaming board,

38:39.900 --> 38:43.404
the raids, the sanctions,
we won't lose this fight.

38:45.906 --> 38:47.950
Okay. Time for a new plan.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.079
We already tried
taking the high road.

38:52.121 --> 38:55.916
If Riverdale doesn't want
to bet on us,

38:55.958 --> 38:59.503
we'll have to lean in
to who we are
and what we do best.

38:59.545 --> 39:01.464
As my mother likes to say,

39:01.505 --> 39:03.716
I am my father's daughter.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.677
Does that mean running scams?
Side hustles and loopholes?

39:06.719 --> 39:08.512
All of the above, Reggie.

39:08.554 --> 39:12.058
All systems go.
And, Heraldo,
that offer you made

39:12.099 --> 39:15.519
about putting out the word
to your wise guys, do it.

39:15.561 --> 39:18.272
We need to
start making money.
Real money, fast.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.108
No problem.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.778
Oh, and by the way,
I looked into that guy for you.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.280
Percival?
And, what did you find?

39:26.864 --> 39:28.699
Nothing.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.369
There's no paper trail
behind him.
The guy's a ghost.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.120
It's like
he didn't even exist

39:33.162 --> 39:34.538
before he showed up
here in Riverdale.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.002
[thunder rumbling]

39:43.005 --> 39:44.423
[door opens]

39:44.465 --> 39:46.717
[man speaking on TV]

39:49.011 --> 39:50.679
[Betty] Archie.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.015
Betty?

39:53.057 --> 39:57.436
Can you do me a favor?
Can you shut off the TV
and the rest of the lights?

39:57.478 --> 39:58.813
[Archie] Yeah, sure.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.067
Is everything okay?

40:03.109 --> 40:06.362
Oh, my God.
What's going on?
Did TBK hurt you?

40:06.404 --> 40:09.407
[Betty] No.
No, I lost him
in Maine.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.201
This is something else.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.203
What?

40:14.245 --> 40:15.955
You know how
I've been getting those
really bad headaches?

40:17.206 --> 40:18.833
They've only gotten worse.

40:18.874 --> 40:21.168
And I figured out that
they are triggered by light.

40:21.210 --> 40:24.171
So, the brighter the light,
the more excruciating the pain.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.757
Oh, my God.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.427
I think it's a side effect
of being able to see auras.

40:29.468 --> 40:31.137
Which I can still do,
by the way.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.598
Hi. [sighs]

40:34.640 --> 40:35.850
[Archie] I'm so sorry.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.768
[Betty whispering]
That's okay.

40:37.810 --> 40:40.229
God, it feels good
to be home.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.273
It hasn't been the same
without you.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.941
Yeah? What did I miss?
Anything?

40:43.983 --> 40:46.277
A lot.

40:46.318 --> 40:50.406
It turns out Jug can
[scoffs] read minds

40:50.448 --> 40:51.740
since the explosion.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.784
-What?
-Yeah.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.203
And Percival Pickens,
that weird guy who
showed up out of nowhere

40:56.245 --> 40:57.288
and tried to buy my house?

40:57.329 --> 40:58.747
[Betty] Mmm-hmm.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.499
We think he can control
people's minds.

41:02.126 --> 41:05.087
Make people do things.
Bad things.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.008
We're in trouble, Betty.
The whole town is.

41:12.344 --> 41:14.638
[scribbling]

41:28.903 --> 41:31.071
[Percival exhales]
