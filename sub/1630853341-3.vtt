WEBVTT

00:08.383 --> 00:11.553
And five,
six, seven, eight.

00:11.636 --> 00:14.514
One, two, three, four,

00:14.597 --> 00:17.559
five, six, seven, eight.

00:17.642 --> 00:17.976
How did your mom die?

00:19.978 --> 00:21.312
Your mom mom,
I mean.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.356
Brain aneurysm.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.909
Do you remember her?

00:38.246 --> 00:39.914
No, I was only two
when she died.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.130
Sometimes I remember things,
but I realize it's just stuff

00:47.213 --> 00:50.967
people have told me
or stuff in pictures.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.512
Then Kathleen became
my mom.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.766
I mean, first,
it was Patty in Germany.

00:57.849 --> 00:58.933
But...

01:01.644 --> 01:03.146
really, it was Kathleen.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.900
She took care of us.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.372
Stay here after finals.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.500
You know I have to go home.

01:23.583 --> 01:27.420
Why do you have to?

01:27.504 --> 01:29.464
The trial's not
for a while still.

01:30.548 --> 01:36.429
Because it might be
the last normal-ish summer

01:36.513 --> 01:37.889
with my family.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.475
Okay.

01:40.558 --> 01:41.976
I'll come visit then.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.939
It'll get weird.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.982
I'm not ready for that.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.370
If I go...

02:01.621 --> 02:03.456
it doesn't have to be
like a coming out party.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.750
We can also pretend
we're just friends.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.800
Promise me
you'll at least call.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.260
Yeah, of course.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.305
The blow poke.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.932
What is it exactly?

04:26.015 --> 04:28.226
Oh, it's a fireplace tool.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.732
Something between a poker
and a bellows.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.906
Nice ride.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.908
Jim
Kathleen's sister
had given one

04:43.992 --> 04:46.536
to each of her siblings
one Christmas years ago.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.539
And after we had done

04:49.622 --> 04:51.666
our initial search
of the house,

04:51.749 --> 04:53.167
taken measurements,
photographs,

04:53.251 --> 04:56.170
she noticed from looking
at those pictures

04:56.254 --> 04:59.799
that it was missing
from the Peterson fireplace.

04:59.882 --> 05:04.345
Now, we don't believe
it was randomly misplaced.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.597
Is there a chance
you experts conclude

05:06.681 --> 05:08.266
she actually died from a fall?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.685
Now, a lot of people
smarter than me

05:10.768 --> 05:12.186
have said from day one

05:12.270 --> 05:14.856
that it could only be
one thing, a beating.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.315
Where could it be?

05:16.399 --> 05:18.234
Wherever Kathleen
hid the thing.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.236
I don't even remember
Candace giving it to her.

05:20.319 --> 05:21.612
Why would you?

05:21.696 --> 05:23.531
Who the fuck
gives fireplace tools

05:23.614 --> 05:24.824
as a Christmas gift?

05:24.907 --> 05:27.452
Let alone
one fireplace tool.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.995
They're kind of handy.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.956
Michael
I swear to God,
that stupid thing

05:32.040 --> 05:34.334
is in there somewhere,

05:34.417 --> 05:36.002
and it ain't covered in blood.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.552
How much
to get rid of 'em?

05:44.635 --> 05:48.389
Well, first of all,
you can't just get rid of 'em.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.309
Bats are special that way.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.102
You gotta relocate 'em.

05:53.186 --> 05:53.561
It's not cheap.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.274
Let me go over a couple
of things with my husband

05:58.357 --> 05:59.942
and, um, give us a few days.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.737
Yeah, the longer you wait,
the worse it's going to get.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.906
At least they're not
in the plumbing.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.202
Then you're really,
you're fucked.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.621
The boys are fucking us.
Both of them need money.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.498
Clayton's gotten fucked
by the market.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.292
And Todd's got
this website thing.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.044
What website thing?

06:18.127 --> 06:19.295
Well, I don't know
what it is.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.922
With Clayton's qualifications,

06:21.005 --> 06:22.090
he could get a job easily.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.341
He needs to focus
on school right now.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.427
-No! Do it again, I dare you.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.263
Mike?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.307
Dog's chewing up
the damn furniture again.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.103
The boys are going to need
your help again, Patty.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.939
Oh dear. I don't know
if now is the ideal moment.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.442
Well, can you refinance
the house again?

06:41.526 --> 06:42.527
-The exterminator's done.
-No, not again.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.947
The banks in Germany frown
on that type of business.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.115
It's not good.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.242
-It's Patty.
-Mike?

06:49.325 --> 06:50.076
Well, things are
really bad at Nortel.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.870
I can't ask Kathleen
for more help.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.084
I understand,
but I really cannot.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.712
So whatever we do to Mike,

07:02.421 --> 07:03.631
it affects them.

07:03.714 --> 07:04.465
Fred
Please stop worrying

07:04.549 --> 07:07.051
about Martha
and Margaret, Cay.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.846
They're the ones who decided
to support a killer.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.098
But they didn't really have
much of a choice.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.766
Jay
Look...

07:13.850 --> 07:15.476
I get it's a lot to process

07:15.560 --> 07:17.311
but as your lawyer,

07:17.395 --> 07:19.272
until you give me
the go-ahead to strike,

07:19.355 --> 07:20.314
Michael's going to keep
getting your mother's money

07:20.398 --> 07:22.525
-to pay for his defense.
-Yes.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.569
But I can get them
to delay payment

07:24.652 --> 07:26.571
until we get allocation
sorted out.

07:26.654 --> 07:27.905
Exactly.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.657
I think it's time, Caitlin,
but it's up to you.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.451
I can't make
this decision for you.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.579
I don't really want to deal
with this right now.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.540
I'll be in Durham
for the summer.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.417
Maybe we can talk about it then.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.794
These were all
on Peterson's computer.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.796
Can you confirm
these are photos of you?

07:47.842 --> 07:49.719
Did you have sex
with Michael Peterson?

07:50.052 --> 07:51.512
No.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.894
"I was in the Marines.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.104
Love to fuck, suck, and rim."

08:03.107 --> 08:03.482
Peterson wrote that to you?

08:05.818 --> 08:07.069
Yeah.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.405
Mr. Wolgamott.

08:11.115 --> 08:14.410
Do you expect me to believe

08:14.493 --> 08:17.622
that after all these emails,
after all these phone calls,

08:17.705 --> 08:19.498
after all this back and forth,

08:19.582 --> 08:23.544
that you two never actually met?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.379
-Never.
-If you say you didn't,

08:25.463 --> 08:26.505
it's not going to get you
out of testifying.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.429
I can't believe you want
to show these in court.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.975
It's a good thing
I'm well hung.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.312
I wouldn't go so far
as to say that.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.521
Brad
You don't think so?

08:45.566 --> 08:46.776
Did you see this one?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.445
We'll let the jury decide.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.615
Well, I'm not surprised.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.867
-Me neither.
-Alright, Ron.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.203
Uh, get something to eat
and head back here.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.082
David
So, uh, that was Ron.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.543
Bill
The search turn up anything?
They find the blow poke?

09:03.626 --> 09:04.126
No, no, nothing.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.588
But, uh, apparently

09:07.672 --> 09:09.257
Deaver's still bashing in
Styrofoam heads

09:09.340 --> 09:11.884
with the one Candace gave them.

09:11.968 --> 09:12.551
Tom
And?

09:12.635 --> 09:15.179
Well, that's the good news.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.056
They haven't been able
to show the blow poke

09:17.139 --> 09:18.474
could create that scene.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.895
The bad news is
the DA is on a crusade

09:22.979 --> 09:24.438
to find someone you slept with.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.147
We should talk
about the emails.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.234
Which emails?

09:28.317 --> 09:31.153
Uh, between Mike
and Brad Wolgamott.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.448
A few other escorts online.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.032
Wait. An escort? What?

09:35.116 --> 09:37.868
Bill, settle down.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.453
Uh, Todd,
maybe you and your mom

09:39.537 --> 09:40.830
can help clean up a bit.

09:40.913 --> 09:41.789
I'll make some coffee.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.666
Sure.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.172
Jean. Please, no family.

09:56.554 --> 10:00.599
Tom, I never met up
with any of those guys.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.561
Yeah, I, I came very close
to meeting up with Brad,

10:03.644 --> 10:04.854
but it didn't happen.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.147
Period.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.154
Sometimes when you listen,

10:13.237 --> 10:14.905
you hear things
you don't want to.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.824
So there are some emails.
So what?

10:16.907 --> 10:19.160
These emails paint
a very vivid picture.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.953
You want a picture?

10:21.037 --> 10:23.622
Huh? I'm a painter, too.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.459
I get up there,
and I read this.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.502
In the same email
where Mike's talking

10:28.586 --> 10:30.671
about doing this,
that, and the other,

10:30.755 --> 10:32.340
Mike says,

10:32.423 --> 10:34.842
"Evenings aren't great
for me anyway.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.177
"I'm married.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.178
"Very happily married,

10:37.261 --> 10:39.096
"with a dynamite wife.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.183
"Yes, I know. I know.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.809
"I'm very bi,

10:43.893 --> 10:44.518
and that's all there is to it."

10:46.562 --> 10:48.105
Can I see that?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.482
That's not somebody
hiding something.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.318
That's someone
who clearly loves his wife.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.363
I mean, it's not
only possible, but common

10:55.446 --> 10:57.365
for these kinds
of arrangements to exist.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.742
The French do it
all the time.

10:59.825 --> 11:03.496
Without anyone to testify
that Kathleen knew,

11:03.579 --> 11:05.706
it's just conjecture.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.625
Well, unless they get
a guy on the stand

11:07.708 --> 11:10.169
to testify
that she didn't know.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.713
I mean, if some emails
and some porn

11:12.797 --> 11:15.591
are all they got?

11:15.674 --> 11:18.219
Hey, this is
our biggest hurdle,

11:18.302 --> 11:19.470
and I'm already over it.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.639
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.766
What type of arrangements
exactly are we talking about?

11:25.476 --> 11:27.061
What do we got?

11:27.144 --> 11:30.439
We have no murder weapon,

11:30.523 --> 11:34.068
and no one can say
they slept with Peterson.

11:34.151 --> 11:37.238
Brad Wolgamott's emails
could help solidify motive,

11:37.321 --> 11:39.115
but without proof of a meeting,

11:39.198 --> 11:41.409
it may not be worth it
to put him on the stand.

11:41.492 --> 11:46.914
But if I get up there
and I say,

11:46.997 --> 11:48.624
"Do you really think...

11:49.417 --> 11:52.086
"do you really think,

11:52.169 --> 11:53.796
"that Kathleen Peterson...

11:58.634 --> 12:00.594
"that this woman knew

12:00.678 --> 12:03.305
"her husband was talking
about fucking this

12:03.389 --> 12:05.474
"and sucking that...

12:08.185 --> 12:09.687
And God knows what else."

12:11.897 --> 12:13.941
Rimming.

12:14.024 --> 12:14.692
Y'all even know what that means?

12:17.361 --> 12:19.738
I believe it is,
uh, cunnilingus

12:19.822 --> 12:21.115
but from the other end.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.618
Wait, don't you mean
on the other end?

12:24.702 --> 12:27.079
-Even with, uh--
-And people enjoy that?

12:27.163 --> 12:29.123
Even with
the Freda Black show...

12:29.999 --> 12:33.961
the connection
between the emails

12:34.044 --> 12:37.089
sent in September to Brad

12:37.173 --> 12:39.633
and Kathleen
being killed in December

12:41.969 --> 12:43.721
is a little fuzzy.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.229
I want actual infidelity.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.607
That's concrete.
That's the story.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.406
Art
Do you recognize
this man right here?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.033
Michael Peterson?

13:07.745 --> 13:10.122
Have you noticed any
kind of strange behavior

13:10.206 --> 13:12.208
with Mr. Peterson or, um,

13:12.291 --> 13:14.418
...homoerotic relationships

13:14.502 --> 13:17.588
with any of your members?

13:25.095 --> 13:25.888
He's never come in here before?

13:25.971 --> 13:29.058
You're absolutely positive?
You sure?

13:33.270 --> 13:34.480
Dennis Rowe.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.024
He mentioned
something about Peterson.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.275
Dennis Rowe?

13:38.359 --> 13:40.277
Yeah. R-O-W-E.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.904
He said he was fun.

13:46.116 --> 13:48.410
Hey.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.454
Hey. Hey, what's up?

13:50.538 --> 13:50.913
You happy to be back?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.166
Yeah.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.084
I don't know. Yeah.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.295
How's SF?
Making a lot of friends?

14:02.132 --> 14:03.175
Boyfriends?

14:04.301 --> 14:04.843
No.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.558
So, you know, the DA's
been laser-focused
on Dad's sexuality.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.394
Well, they were before I left.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.603
Yeah. Right. So,

14:14.687 --> 14:16.230
I mean, you knew about the porn

14:16.313 --> 14:18.816
and that Dad
was talking with escorts.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.990
- Dad was cheating on Mom?
- No.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.908
I mean, they had an agreement.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.828
And Dad's happy, and,
and she was happy, so...

14:31.662 --> 14:34.081
Have you talked
to him about it?

14:34.164 --> 14:37.751
No. I mean, I don't know.
That's between those adults.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.713
I just feel like
we should be able
to have that dialog.

14:40.796 --> 14:41.922
If you want to go talk
to him, go ahead.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.966
Alright? I'll make sure
I'm a hundred miles away.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.672
Yeah, well, I'm glad...

16:04.755 --> 16:06.507
I'm glad you found me too.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.515
...word of mouth, you know.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.183
Yeah. I think so...

16:24.024 --> 16:26.694
...I'm seeing people
every other week.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.654
Oh, what the-- Surprise!

16:29.446 --> 16:31.365
What's going on?

16:31.448 --> 16:32.074
Got you a massage.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.952
I know it's been
a little rough.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.079
I thought you deserved
something nice.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.545
I'm actually running for,

16:44.628 --> 16:47.131
uh, for Durham City Council,
you know.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.050
Some say that
the city council does

16:50.134 --> 16:53.220
more than the mayor's office,
you know, ever does.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.430
-Is that right?
-Oh yeah.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.807
You said you live by that
low-income development, right?

16:56.890 --> 16:59.727
Yeah. Yeah. Bit of an eyesore.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.271
-- Mm-hm.
-- Hi. You want
to start face down.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.564
-We'll get going.
-Sure.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.287
How's that face cradle?
Is it okay?

17:18.370 --> 17:19.121
-- Mm-hmm.
-- Right.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.420
How's that pressure?

17:26.503 --> 17:27.713
Mm. Good. Great.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.089
Thank you.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.716
That project
could have been great.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.301
And not just for
the people who need--

17:32.384 --> 17:33.886
Mike.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.971
You gonna be here
the whole time?

17:36.054 --> 17:37.806
I'm just talking
to a future constituent.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.934
Maybe you should go
to Blockbuster now

17:41.018 --> 17:43.270
and, you know, before all
the good movies are gone.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.563
Okay!

17:45.731 --> 17:47.608
James, take care of my wife.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.901
She's a delicate flower.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.153
-I'll do my best.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.843
Do you know this guy?
Dennis Rowe? R-O-W-E?

18:15.761 --> 18:16.053
Mike?

18:21.141 --> 18:22.017
No, I don't know
who the hell he is.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.396
You meet a lot of people
when you're campaigning.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.440
Well, apparently,
he's a friend of Lori's.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.359
Kathleen used to babysit him

18:30.442 --> 18:31.985
and his brothers
when they were kids.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.987
My sources say he has a limp.

18:34.071 --> 18:34.988
A limp!

18:36.281 --> 18:38.325
Says you had sex with him
four or five times.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.701
Oh, you're shitting me!

18:41.119 --> 18:43.580
-That's what he's claiming.
-Oh my god.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.707
Rather know now than later.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.002
Did he indicate where this
great love affair took place?

18:49.086 --> 18:50.337
He hasn't given
a full statement yet.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.172
Oh, when he does, get it to me.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.131
I'm dying to see it.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.510
-- Will do.
-- Is that it, then?

18:57.427 --> 19:00.097
Uh, yeah. Till we get more.

19:00.180 --> 19:00.889
We're going to need
to digest this

19:00.973 --> 19:02.850
and rethink
how we approach it.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.644
When we lived in Germany,

19:05.727 --> 19:09.606
Mike had many dalliances
with men and women,

19:09.690 --> 19:12.359
and I didn't end up
at the bottom of the stairs.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.111
-Patty.
-My ex-wife, everyone.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.654
She'll, uh,
she'll be around all week.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.117
Mike, can I talk
to you for a second?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.177
How-how many more men
are they going to turn up?

19:39.261 --> 19:42.556
I, I don't know, Bill.
I don't keep a diary.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.683
But I'm pretty sure
I never fucked a cripple.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.857
No. You said,
"No affairs, Bill."

19:51.940 --> 19:54.610
Well, they weren't affairs.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.529
I, I never, I never took any
of those guys out to dinner.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.697
It was just sex.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.201
Don't "Michael Peterson" me.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.745
I mean, sex is affairs.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.705
You... lied.

20:06.788 --> 20:10.375
You slept around on Patty.
You slept around on Kathleen.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.793
Well, I, I didn't lie.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.087
What? You heard her.

20:14.171 --> 20:17.925
I slept with men and women
when we were married.

20:18.008 --> 20:21.261
I only had sex with men

20:21.345 --> 20:22.971
since I married Kathleen.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.766
-Don't you get it?
-Kathleen knew?

20:25.849 --> 20:28.352
And answer the question.

20:28.435 --> 20:29.603
You sound
like her right now!

20:29.686 --> 20:30.437
"Just answer
the question, Mike."

20:30.520 --> 20:34.566
No, no. She knew,
and she understood.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.318
To say otherwise, it's,
it's just insulting to her.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.495
I should have
mentioned this, uh, before.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.081
I'm going to go to Reno
for a couple of days.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.458
What? Well, for how long?

20:51.541 --> 20:52.876
A couple of weeks.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.463
I just, I need to try
and figure out a balance

20:56.546 --> 20:58.423
between home and Durham.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.635
What? Come on.
You can't leave because
you're pissed at me.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.136
That's not why I'm leaving.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.640
I'm leaving because
I want to see my family.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.141
What? Who's going to
take care of everything?

21:08.225 --> 21:10.185
Make sure, make sure
the bills are paid?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.144
Here-here-here's
the latest Nortel check.

21:11.228 --> 21:14.272
You go to the bank,
walk up to the teller,

21:14.356 --> 21:15.482
sign the back, hand it over.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.358
It's not that difficult.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.818
You're, you're here
to take care of me,

21:17.901 --> 21:19.152
not to give me a hard time.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.154
I know it's hard
for you to believe,

21:21.238 --> 21:22.280
it's not all about you.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.241
No, it is!
It is all about me.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.911
Make no mistake,
for the next little while

21:27.995 --> 21:30.288
or however fuckin' long
this takes,

21:30.372 --> 21:31.957
it is about me.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.917
Now when it's your ass
about to go to prison

21:34.001 --> 21:34.501
for the rest of your life,
it can be about you.

21:34.584 --> 21:35.836
Take a breath.

21:46.096 --> 21:46.388
I loved her.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.476
And she fucking loved me too.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.904
Dennis
The first time
was about eight years ago

22:02.988 --> 22:05.198
at the sex shop off the 110.

22:05.282 --> 22:09.494
Then a few years later
again at the YMCA.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.248
-The Forest Hills Y?
-Yeah.

22:14.958 --> 22:15.292
You work out there?

22:18.712 --> 22:20.505
On occasion.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.842
Uh, so you didn't know

22:23.925 --> 22:25.469
who you were having
intercourse with?

22:25.552 --> 22:29.598
No. I didn't know who he was
until I walked into his house,

22:29.681 --> 22:31.892
and Lori
introduced me to him.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.895
After the party,
did you tell Lori

22:34.978 --> 22:36.813
about your connection
with Michael?

22:36.897 --> 22:40.525
No, I... I didn't...

22:41.526 --> 22:43.361
I didn't see any reason
to create a problem.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.866
Do you know anyone else
who might have slept

22:47.949 --> 22:48.450
with Michael Peterson?

22:50.327 --> 22:51.703
Um...

22:53.622 --> 22:55.957
You can tell us now
or under oath.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.171
I would talk
to Tyrone Lacour.

23:01.254 --> 23:04.591
You're friends
with Tyrone Lacour?

23:04.674 --> 23:06.426
No. Not friends.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.427
We're in a small community.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.972
I told him the story
after the campaign event.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.724
He, he looked up
Michael's picture

23:12.808 --> 23:14.559
and-and-and thought
he looked familiar.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.356
Alright.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.277
Well, Mr. Rowe,

23:24.361 --> 23:27.072
what I'd love
for you to do for me

23:27.155 --> 23:29.116
is write down

23:29.199 --> 23:31.660
what you remember
from your encounters

23:31.743 --> 23:32.410
with Peterson.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.502
Every detail,
no matter how small.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.880
We want to know everything.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.675
Uh-uh. No. Nothing.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.677
Hey. More blood.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.255
Take another look,
Tyrone.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.717
Maybe an anonymous hookup
somewhere.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.510
Who's telling you this shit?

25:12.594 --> 25:14.387
Someone trustworthy.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.597
Reputable.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.978
-I ain't no fag.
Well, if somethin'
comes to mind...

25:22.062 --> 25:24.105
give me a call.
You've got my card.

25:25.523 --> 25:26.483
Was that enough time for you?

25:26.566 --> 25:30.070
-- Yes, sir.
-- Let's see what we've got.

25:33.531 --> 25:34.407
What's this list?

25:34.491 --> 25:37.327
Names of other people
I've slept with.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.746
If you're going
to get me up there
and ask about Peterson,

25:39.829 --> 25:41.456
I'm guessing
I'll also be asked

25:41.539 --> 25:42.916
about the other important
married men in town

25:42.999 --> 25:45.627
I've slept with.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.255
Some of whom I, I think
you know pretty well.

25:55.011 --> 25:57.514
Your friends?

25:57.597 --> 25:59.140
Acquaintances.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.851
Donors, actually.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.564
I don't see this
playing out well for us, Freda.

26:11.236 --> 26:11.653
Outing...

26:15.365 --> 26:18.451
innocent people on the stand

26:18.535 --> 26:21.955
in order to show what
Michael Peterson was up to.

26:22.038 --> 26:24.791
Well, we have the autopsy,

26:24.874 --> 26:27.460
the crime scene, the photos,

26:27.544 --> 26:28.670
the emails.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.464
We have our theory.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.177
A man who is hiding

26:36.261 --> 26:39.848
gets caught and explodes.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.893
It all feels circumstantial.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.356
We have a theory

26:48.440 --> 26:51.276
about a motive
and no murder weapon.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.783
Well, I guess
we also still got Brad.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.163
Their search
has hit a dead end.

27:03.246 --> 27:04.748
I told you I didn't
know this Rowe guy.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.875
Apparently, you're not
as hot as we thought.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.793
Why did it seem like everyone
wants a piece of me?

27:09.794 --> 27:11.212
Well...

27:11.296 --> 27:12.464
What are you up to
this weekend?

27:12.547 --> 27:15.842
-Working for you.
-What? No, forget me.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.969
Just spend time
with your wife and kid, man.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.972
Well, Charlene's not so crazy
about me right now.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.016
Oh yeah? What'd you do?

27:23.099 --> 27:25.977
Renovations
and well, let's just say...

27:27.395 --> 27:29.189
I admire the relationship
you and Kathleen had.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.732
Where she let you be you.

27:33.109 --> 27:34.861
My wife and I are just not
on the same page.

27:34.944 --> 27:37.822
Oh.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.574
Happy to talk my problems,

27:39.657 --> 27:42.243
but, uh, I'm still on
the clock here, Mike.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.371
Well, geez. Never mind.
I can't afford you as it is.

27:44.454 --> 27:47.457
Okay. Well...
thank you, David.

27:47.540 --> 27:51.086
Thank me when we hear
"Not guilty."

27:51.169 --> 27:52.629
-Good night.
-Good night.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.675
Nothing! Nothing!

27:57.759 --> 27:59.427
They got nothin'.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.262
-What's going on?
-Rowe guy crapped out.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.889
DA's got nothing.

28:02.972 --> 28:04.474
Dad, this is great.

28:05.141 --> 28:07.727
Hey, Dad.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.108
Would you talk
about it with me?

28:13.191 --> 28:14.567
Talk about what?

28:19.948 --> 28:23.076
You really want to talk
about your dad's sex life?

28:26.246 --> 28:28.498
Go to bed, honey.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.960
Okay. Good night.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.191
Oh my god.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.026
Oh!

29:07.078 --> 29:09.539
Hello?

29:09.622 --> 29:10.457
Hey, it's Brad.
How's it going?

29:10.540 --> 29:14.627
Uh, well, um...
things are crazy,

29:14.711 --> 29:17.046
but, um, you know, good.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.590
You know, election's coming up.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.340
You?

29:19.424 --> 29:22.469
Not too bad.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.345
So, look,
I have to cancel.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.139
-What?
-Yeah.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.433
-Why?
-My schedule's changed.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.894
I have to get up to Durham
and back to Tampa

29:30.977 --> 29:33.313
in less than a day and...

29:33.396 --> 29:34.814
And I just think
my ass might need

29:34.898 --> 29:36.566
at least a couple days
to recover.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.738
Well, uh, let me know
when you're passing through.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.741
For sure.

29:44.824 --> 29:45.909
Promise me something though.

29:45.992 --> 29:46.826
What?

29:46.910 --> 29:49.162
Stay hard
till I get there.

29:49.245 --> 29:51.539
Uh, yeah. Alright.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.248
Take care.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.584
Yeah, you too. Bye.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.110
Oh.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.447
Oh, that was
really very good.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.281
Thank you so much.

30:25.365 --> 30:28.243
Uh, are you good or...

30:28.326 --> 30:29.244
-I'm good. Yeah.
I'll clear out.
-Yeah? Alright.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.454
Thanks again.

31:46.070 --> 31:46.988
Oh...

31:48.406 --> 31:50.658
Goddamn bats.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.328
Oh.

33:03.606 --> 33:04.691
Uh, how was the massage?

33:04.774 --> 33:08.986
Amazing. Until I had
to take a shower.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.989
I think the bats are chewing
the pipes or clogging them.

33:12.073 --> 33:12.699
All I know is, it's a problem.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.909
Mm-hmm.
I'll figure it out.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.079
Let's just enjoy
the night. Hmm?

33:25.211 --> 33:26.963
Hmm.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.009
-Where are the dogs?
-Who cares?

33:34.762 --> 33:37.223
Almost ripped up the rug today.

33:37.306 --> 33:39.767
Oh yeah, I meant to ask.
How'd the talk go with Patty?

33:39.851 --> 33:41.144
Oh, right.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.895
Um, well, uh...

33:42.979 --> 33:46.774
she can't refinance
the house again.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.776
It's something-- German laws
makes it verboten,

33:48.860 --> 33:51.863
so I, I think
we're going to have to...

33:51.946 --> 33:54.824
I think we're going to
have to keep chipping in
to help with the boys.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.456
I know what
you're doing here.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.333
Butter me up with a massage
and a romantic night,

34:04.417 --> 34:07.587
and then you ask me
to bail your kids out again

34:07.670 --> 34:08.504
because you let them
get away with murder.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.590
Especially Clayton.

34:10.673 --> 34:11.924
I, I know you're mad
at him. I am, too.

34:12.008 --> 34:15.344
You literally bought him
a car when things blew up.

34:15.428 --> 34:19.307
Well, nothing actually
blew up... that time.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.809
Clay got lucky.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.937
And you... are playing me.

34:26.689 --> 34:27.148
Is it working?

34:30.067 --> 34:32.862
The Great Dissembler,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.261
I guess we'll do
what we always do,

34:57.345 --> 34:58.054
just figure it out.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.060
Some money for the boys.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.147
We need to deal with
the plumbing first.

35:11.150 --> 35:11.192
And then...

35:12.527 --> 35:15.029
Ohh.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.990
We'll, um...

35:31.587 --> 35:34.257
And then...

35:35.424 --> 35:37.802
we'll, um...

35:42.098 --> 35:45.601
Oh... We'll deal
with the bats later.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.944
Hello.

35:55.027 --> 35:57.154
I know you gave them
my name, Dennis.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.657
I will do you like that
Peterson bitch. You hear me?

35:59.740 --> 36:00.908
You shut your mouth.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.076
Shut it.

36:02.910 --> 36:05.413
-Tyrone?

36:07.123 --> 36:08.165
Shit.

36:08.249 --> 36:11.502
What do you think of...

36:11.586 --> 36:13.045
...when you think
of Kathleen?

36:13.129 --> 36:15.548
I think of just these

36:15.631 --> 36:19.176
wonderful and funny moments.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.261
-Hello?
-Shh!

36:20.344 --> 36:21.888
She was so funny.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.683
There's this, there's this
wonderful photo of her

36:25.766 --> 36:31.063
in front of the Imperial Palace
in Tokyo just... looking.

36:31.147 --> 36:35.443
Or just... how we talk
about the kids.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.446
Is it strange for you to be
in the house where she died?

36:39.155 --> 36:40.406
No.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.116
I feel her here.

36:44.327 --> 36:47.622
Just imagine she might walk
through that door any moment,

36:47.705 --> 36:49.248
just smiling,

36:49.332 --> 36:50.291
laughing, just...

36:52.335 --> 36:54.128
telling me I'm going
to be late for something.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.970
Shit.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.849
Sorry.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.267
Can we take a moment?

37:08.351 --> 37:09.518
Yeah.

37:09.602 --> 37:10.937
Come here, Margie.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.438
I know you didn't come home
just to hear me talk.

37:12.521 --> 37:15.483
You finally found someone
who has to listen
to your stories.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.734
Come here.

37:16.817 --> 37:20.696
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
my other daughter, Margaret.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.448
-- Hi.
Is it weird being back?

37:22.531 --> 37:23.991
Yeah, it was a little
weird going through town,

37:24.075 --> 37:27.036
like, but it's good
to be home.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.872
You guys hungry?
Should we make some lunch?

37:29.956 --> 37:32.917
Michael, are you sure
it's okay to shoot the girls?

37:38.422 --> 37:39.340
Sure.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.761
You get used to it
faster than you think.

37:43.844 --> 37:44.720
Todd loves it.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.674
Huh? What? Huh?

38:21.757 --> 38:23.050
Come on.

39:28.616 --> 39:31.660
We've kept the office
just the way she left it.

39:33.287 --> 39:36.665
The only things that are gone
are the calendar

39:36.749 --> 39:38.292
and the diary she had
in her desk.

39:38.375 --> 39:41.921
The police took them
pretty early on.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.839
What did Mike take?

39:43.923 --> 39:45.424
Michael hasn't taken anything.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.345
What about Martha
and Margaret?

39:49.428 --> 39:50.554
Did they come by?

39:50.638 --> 39:52.515
No one's reached out
this whole time but you.

39:53.974 --> 39:55.851
I sent in my condolences
pretty early on,

39:55.935 --> 39:58.604
but once
the investigation started,

39:58.687 --> 40:01.357
I figured, better
to keep my distance.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.276
I don't know why I thought

40:04.360 --> 40:05.277
that they'd be interested
in this stuff.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.495
Sorry, do you mind if I have
a moment alone here?

40:15.287 --> 40:15.788
Of course.

40:15.871 --> 40:18.082
Take your time.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.506
Good morning.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.758
-Morning.
-The trial's
around the corner.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.052
We gotta control the narrative.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.847
I don't see a way
around it, so,

41:14.930 --> 41:16.515
the interview
would be filmed here,

41:16.599 --> 41:21.520
but it will be syndicated
to all ABC affiliates.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.606
We can have the eyes
and ears of the country.

41:27.902 --> 41:28.485
What you doing?

41:31.113 --> 41:33.240
Well, I'm just going
through autopsy reports.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.035
That's totally normal.

41:37.077 --> 41:38.787
Nothing's normal anymore.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.874
-I know. I was kidding.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.424
Martha...

41:50.507 --> 41:52.092
Hey.

41:53.344 --> 41:57.097
So they want us to do
an interview on the news.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.224
-What?
-I know.

41:58.307 --> 41:59.725
I don't want to do that.

41:59.808 --> 42:00.518
-I know, I--
-So...

42:02.811 --> 42:04.897
what do you think?

42:04.980 --> 42:07.066
The reporter, Sonya Pfeiffer,
is a friend,

42:07.149 --> 42:08.400
so no curveballs.

42:08.484 --> 42:11.654
This is what Caitlin
would be doing

42:11.737 --> 42:14.448
for the family if she was here.

42:14.531 --> 42:16.075
Uh, we're not sure.

42:16.158 --> 42:17.534
It's just like
a lot of people.

42:24.083 --> 42:27.253
Well, seems like you're already
getting used to an audience.

42:28.337 --> 42:30.339
Yeah, but it's...

42:31.590 --> 42:32.091
it's a news show on TV.

42:32.174 --> 42:34.635
It's, like, immediate.

42:34.718 --> 42:37.096
What if we say the wrong thing?

42:37.179 --> 42:37.513
No, you girls will do great.

42:39.515 --> 42:40.099
Alright?

42:40.182 --> 42:42.977
Look, you'll have to accept,

42:43.060 --> 42:46.522
sooner or later,

42:46.605 --> 42:48.691
everyone's going
to know who you are.

42:56.865 --> 43:00.619
I'm not going to push
you girls to do anything
you don't want to do.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.748
You know
let Caitlin and Candace

43:04.832 --> 43:05.874
piss on our family
if that's what they--

43:05.958 --> 43:07.501
-Dad...
-No. No, I mean it.
Fuck them!

43:10.296 --> 43:11.505
I'd rather go to prison

43:11.588 --> 43:12.506
that put you girls
through any more pain.

43:17.136 --> 43:17.511
We're okay.

43:19.388 --> 43:22.683
We'll, we'll do
what we have to.

43:22.766 --> 43:25.811
Great. I'm going
to get it set.

43:25.894 --> 43:29.189
And, uh, Martha,
think about dyeing your hair.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.733
Bleach blonde
isn't great on camera.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.345
It's really good
to see you, man.

44:00.387 --> 44:02.181
I've been thinking
about you and your dad.

44:02.264 --> 44:03.515
-Yeah.
-Your mom--

44:03.599 --> 44:06.018
Yeah, man.
It's, it's been intense.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.728
I'm telling you, man. Cabo.

44:10.105 --> 44:11.190
Look how tan I am. Right?

44:11.273 --> 44:13.359
I'm fuckin' hot. Right?

44:18.781 --> 44:19.698
Fuck.

44:22.576 --> 44:23.535
Oh.

44:24.787 --> 44:25.537
Oh.

44:26.163 --> 44:28.415
That's good shit, huh?

44:30.709 --> 44:31.752
Man...

44:32.461 --> 44:33.545
You know...

44:34.963 --> 44:37.049
-the thing about my dad...
-I love your dad.

44:37.132 --> 44:37.883
...is he's people.

44:37.966 --> 44:40.302
You know?

44:40.386 --> 44:41.303
What I'm starting
to realize is

44:41.387 --> 44:42.763
that people are just people.

44:44.973 --> 44:46.058
And they go, and they,
they create these labels.

44:48.519 --> 44:49.895
They just try
to categorize people.

44:51.438 --> 44:52.815
What are you talking about?

44:56.652 --> 44:58.070
It's just my dad
is complicated.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.782
-You wanna do
another one?
-Yeah.

45:01.865 --> 45:03.992
Dude, I'm telling you,
Cabo's so fuckin' sick.

45:04.076 --> 45:05.661
You got to get away
from here, man.

45:05.744 --> 45:07.830
Fuck, and I already did,
like, all the groundwork
and everything.

45:07.913 --> 45:08.580
Timeshare shit there, man.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.833
Like, you can make
ten to one

45:10.916 --> 45:11.583
fucking on your investment,
I'm telling you, dude.

45:26.181 --> 45:26.723
What--?

45:31.395 --> 45:33.021
Oh fuck.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.316
Fuck.

45:48.620 --> 45:49.705
I'm sorry, Dad, I--

45:49.788 --> 45:51.165
Imagine people seeing my son

45:51.248 --> 45:52.666
getting wasted around town.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.460
They're gonna think
we're a family of assholes.

45:54.543 --> 45:57.129
Clayton's the fuckup,
not you.

45:58.088 --> 46:00.632
You're my centurion.
I need you focused.

46:03.635 --> 46:05.679
I know. I'm sorry, Dad--

46:05.762 --> 46:07.139
Now go on up
and have a shower.

46:23.447 --> 46:24.823
-You okay?
-Yeah.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.700
Just, um...
give me a minute,

46:26.783 --> 46:27.868
I'll get breakfast ready.

46:27.951 --> 46:29.161
We can do it.

46:29.244 --> 46:29.786
No, it's fine.
Just give me a minute.

46:34.750 --> 46:36.627
What does that mean?
Can you forward me the letter?

46:36.710 --> 46:38.337
Yes, we will.

46:38.420 --> 46:41.089
Bottom line, though,
Caitlin's lawyer was successful

46:41.173 --> 46:43.300
in stopping the payments
coming from Nortel.

46:43.383 --> 46:45.302
She and her biological father

46:45.385 --> 46:46.345
have been identified
as the next of kin.

46:46.428 --> 46:48.889
On the life insurance?

46:50.390 --> 46:51.600
You shouldn't count on it.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.520
After everything
I've done for her.

46:55.938 --> 46:57.189
Greedy bitch.

46:57.272 --> 46:58.106
I can talk to Jackie

46:58.190 --> 47:00.859
about refinancing the house
when I see her.

47:00.943 --> 47:03.028
Maybe dip
into Dad's savings.

47:03.111 --> 47:04.738
My dad's in
a nursing home in Reno.

47:04.821 --> 47:07.199
He has some savings that we
were going to probably inherit.

47:07.282 --> 47:08.826
It's not much, but...

47:08.909 --> 47:10.536
Don't be gone
too long, Bill.

47:10.619 --> 47:13.830
Please, okay?
I need you here.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.291
Don't worry, Mike.
I'll be back soon enough.

47:25.759 --> 47:27.052
Don't worry.

47:27.135 --> 47:28.846
David's a good friend.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.847
I swear
I'll make it painless.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.766
You good? Alright.

47:34.268 --> 47:35.602
Well, just, um, imagine
I'm one of the girls

47:35.686 --> 47:38.730
and we're, we're getting
to know each other.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.608
With the interview,
are you going to ask

47:41.692 --> 47:44.903
about our, our mom-mom
in Germany?

47:44.987 --> 47:46.196
No, well, just,
just what you remember.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.699
Uh, the good things.

47:48.782 --> 47:49.825
Thanks. Yeah.

47:52.578 --> 47:53.954
Sonya
Okay.

47:56.748 --> 47:59.167
This is Sonya Pfeiffer
reporting

47:59.251 --> 48:00.877
for WTVD Channel 11 News.

48:00.961 --> 48:05.132
I'm with the daughters
of novelist Michael Peterson

48:05.215 --> 48:07.342
who is preparing for trial
for the murder of his wife

48:07.426 --> 48:09.011
Kathleen.

48:09.094 --> 48:12.472
Today, they break
their silence on the case

48:12.556 --> 48:14.391
in this exclusive interview.

48:14.474 --> 48:15.559
Born to George
and Liz Ratliff

48:15.642 --> 48:17.185
in Germany in the 1980s,

48:17.269 --> 48:20.731
where their father
was stationed
on a military base,

48:20.814 --> 48:22.524
Margaret was only two,

48:22.608 --> 48:24.234
Martha not even one,

48:24.318 --> 48:25.360
when he died
on a mission in Panama.

48:25.444 --> 48:26.778
A year later,

48:26.862 --> 48:30.157
their mother died
of a brain aneurysm.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.367
Within the course
of two years,

48:32.451 --> 48:35.037
they lost both
their biological parents.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.664
I remember almost
nothing from that time.

48:37.748 --> 48:40.334
Yeah.
I, I only remember

48:40.417 --> 48:42.961
what people tell me
about that period.

48:43.045 --> 48:45.505
Two of those people
were Michael Peterson

48:45.589 --> 48:47.257
and his wife
at the time, Patty,

48:47.341 --> 48:49.217
who were neighbors
and close friends.

48:49.301 --> 48:50.135
It was confusing

48:50.218 --> 48:52.971
when Michael left Patty
for Kathleen.

48:53.055 --> 48:55.349
-- Exactly.
-- Yeah,
confusing but wonderful.

48:55.432 --> 48:57.601
He's an adulterer.

48:57.684 --> 48:59.770
Ka-Kathleen became our mom.

48:59.853 --> 49:02.898
He loved her,
and, and she loved us.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.691
And the wedding was here.

49:04.775 --> 49:07.361
And you two
were bridesmaids?

49:07.444 --> 49:08.862
Yeah, we, we, like,
sprinkled rose petals

49:08.945 --> 49:10.489
up the stairs on the way
to their bedroom.

49:10.572 --> 49:11.823
It was like a movie.

49:17.663 --> 49:18.789
Hello?

49:18.872 --> 49:20.624
Margaret
Hi, this is Margaret Blair.

49:20.707 --> 49:22.209
I'm calling to speak
with the DA.

49:23.418 --> 49:25.962
Um, I'm Freda Black.
I'm an ADA here.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.714
Margaret
I'm sorry to be
calling so late,

49:27.798 --> 49:29.841
but I've been speaking
with God,

49:29.925 --> 49:32.844
and he will not allow me
to stay silent any longer.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.097
"Speak, Margaret, speak,"
He said.

49:35.180 --> 49:36.765
I'm sorry.
Who did you say was calling?

49:36.848 --> 49:39.851
Margaret Blair.
Liz Ratliff's sister.

49:39.935 --> 49:42.854
Martha and Margie
are my nieces.

49:42.938 --> 49:45.399
I need to tell you
about their mother's death.

49:45.482 --> 49:50.153
You found another woman
at the bottom of the stairs?

49:50.237 --> 49:51.822
Liz had been complaining
for weeks.

49:51.905 --> 49:54.074
For weeks about these,
these migraines she was having.

49:54.157 --> 49:56.368
What the fuck, Mike?
We're four weeks out!

49:56.451 --> 49:57.911
How could you not tell me?

49:57.994 --> 50:01.373
It was 20 years ago!
In Germany!

50:01.456 --> 50:03.125
Why would I,
why would I even think of it?

50:03.208 --> 50:06.128
I was helping her out with
something or other that night,

50:06.211 --> 50:08.714
I don't remember what,
but I left Liz

50:08.797 --> 50:11.174
very much alive
and on her way to bed.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.136
The next morning,
the girls' nanny, Agnes,

50:14.928 --> 50:17.305
woke us up...

50:17.389 --> 50:19.015
to tell us she'd found Liz
at the bottom of the stairs.

50:19.099 --> 50:21.727
The Ratliffs
were practically family.

50:21.810 --> 50:23.186
We taught at the same school.

50:23.270 --> 50:23.895
That's it!

50:23.979 --> 50:27.065
Liz's autopsy.
It's all there.

50:27.149 --> 50:29.651
Margaret
Look, I told you,
this can't be a coincidence.

50:29.735 --> 50:32.738
I know that he raised you,
but he is not good.

50:32.821 --> 50:35.407
That's our dad!
You can say those things!

50:35.490 --> 50:37.325
He's very manipulative,
Margaret.

50:38.660 --> 50:41.580
I haven't even told you half
of what we know about Germany.

50:41.663 --> 50:43.331
I can't talk
to you anymore. Goodbye.

50:43.415 --> 50:44.124
Margaret
Beware of false prophets who--

50:46.668 --> 50:49.129
Jesus Christ...

50:49.212 --> 50:51.423
She's crazy.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.261
It is kind of
a weird coincidence

50:56.344 --> 50:59.055
we've had two moms die
at the bottom of the stairs.

51:05.771 --> 51:07.355
So what are you saying?

51:11.735 --> 51:13.445
I'm not saying anything.
I'm just...

51:15.030 --> 51:15.530
We just haven't talked
about it.

51:15.614 --> 51:17.157
Don't freak out on me.

51:19.868 --> 51:23.580
So you think
there's some connection?

51:23.663 --> 51:26.249
I can see why
Aunt Margaret's suspicious.

51:26.333 --> 51:28.585
Mom died of a brain aneurysm

51:28.668 --> 51:30.003
which caused her
to fall down the stairs.

51:30.086 --> 51:31.046
It was an accident.

51:31.129 --> 51:32.923
The same way
Kathleen was an accident.

51:33.006 --> 51:34.007
Yes, exactly.

51:34.090 --> 51:36.259
And, like, isn't that weird?

51:36.343 --> 51:37.052
All of it's weird.

51:37.135 --> 51:40.639
Our dad died
mysteriously in Panama.

51:40.722 --> 51:42.974
In fact, where was Mike
when 9/11 happened?

51:43.058 --> 51:45.560
Oh, stop it, you sound
fucking ridiculous.

51:45.644 --> 51:47.145
Well, you're starting
to sound like Caitlin.

51:48.897 --> 51:50.315
It's like you don't
even remember

51:50.398 --> 51:51.775
what happened
before Christmas.

51:51.858 --> 51:53.485
Yes, I do.

51:53.568 --> 51:57.739
And then Kathleen died.
And now we have to grow up.

51:57.823 --> 51:59.991
Dad has been there
for us always.

52:00.075 --> 52:01.576
He didn't have
to take us in, but he did.

52:01.660 --> 52:04.412
That's all that matters.

52:04.496 --> 52:07.499
So just stop questioning
everything. Just stop.

52:07.582 --> 52:10.210
I can't. Can't. I can't!

52:15.757 --> 52:16.925
Was it strange for Mike

52:17.008 --> 52:20.053
to have been over
at Liz's without you?

52:20.136 --> 52:20.846
Oh no, not at all.

52:20.929 --> 52:22.806
After George died,
Liz needed a man

52:22.889 --> 52:25.058
to help around the house.

52:25.141 --> 52:26.560
Well...

52:26.643 --> 52:28.937
The DA's going to suggest
some infidelity.

52:29.020 --> 52:30.188
You know that, right?

52:30.272 --> 52:30.897
Liz and I were good friends.
That's it.

52:30.981 --> 52:33.191
Under no circumstances

52:33.275 --> 52:37.195
would she put carnal desires
above our friendship.

52:37.279 --> 52:39.656
And as far as Michael's
impropriety, at the time,

52:39.739 --> 52:42.033
he was never very good
at hiding it.

52:42.117 --> 52:43.076
I didn't sleep with Liz.

52:45.161 --> 52:46.705
This is all
in German, Mike.

52:46.788 --> 52:47.539
Patty can
translate it for you.

52:47.622 --> 52:50.083
It says what
I've already told you.

52:50.166 --> 52:53.044
Liz Ratliff died of a,
of a brain aneurysm.

52:53.128 --> 52:56.047
We'll, um, get
a court-certified translator

52:56.131 --> 52:57.883
and turn it all over
to the DA.

52:57.966 --> 53:00.385
We don't want to look like
we're hiding anything.

53:00.468 --> 53:01.636
Well, I'm not.

53:03.305 --> 53:07.893
I'm going to need to speak
with the girls, uh, privately.

53:07.976 --> 53:10.186
-By all means.
-No cameras, please.

53:10.270 --> 53:13.023
Mike, can you please.

53:13.106 --> 53:16.151
Thanks. I'll come get you
when this is over.

53:20.822 --> 53:22.240
The girls knew?

53:23.783 --> 53:26.328
Not just about the aneurysm,
but the stairs?

53:28.413 --> 53:30.707
It's essential you're honest
with me right now.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.585
Ask them.

53:40.383 --> 53:41.718
Hey, girls!

53:45.221 --> 53:46.765
It must feel surreal

53:48.016 --> 53:49.684
you're getting
pulled into this.

53:51.895 --> 53:55.482
Look, the most important thing
to me is the truth.

53:55.565 --> 53:58.902
And if there's anything
you want to say

53:58.985 --> 54:00.362
about your mother's death...

54:00.862 --> 54:02.948
anything at all,

54:03.657 --> 54:05.116
now's the time to say it.

54:07.535 --> 54:08.119
Wait, which mom's death?

54:11.623 --> 54:13.625
Liz mom.

54:13.708 --> 54:15.126
Your biological mother.

54:27.138 --> 54:29.099
Hey, Mike.

54:29.182 --> 54:31.977
Everything checks out.
I'll stick around
in case you need me.

54:43.905 --> 54:45.615
You girls okay?

54:50.620 --> 54:52.080
It's us against them.

54:53.665 --> 54:55.667
And they're, uh,
clearly willing to go

54:55.750 --> 54:57.043
as low as possible to hurt us.

54:57.711 --> 54:58.878
And we can't let them.

55:01.881 --> 55:04.092
There are no secrets
between us anymore.

55:21.776 --> 55:22.944
Rudolph's already
filing a motion

55:23.028 --> 55:26.489
to keep Liz Ratliff out.

55:26.573 --> 55:28.366
We can argue the 404.

55:28.450 --> 55:30.035
Oh yeah.
Come on in.

55:36.332 --> 55:39.294
I was just thinking
about these two girls.

55:45.050 --> 55:45.717
How are yours doing?

55:45.800 --> 55:48.136
Oh, they're good.

55:50.138 --> 55:51.890
I've been teasing 'em.

55:51.973 --> 55:53.683
They've been eating
so much mac and cheese

55:53.767 --> 55:55.727
that, that their hair
is going to get curly.

55:58.980 --> 56:00.857
-Never heard of that.
-Mm-hmm.

56:02.776 --> 56:04.694
Hmm.

56:04.778 --> 56:06.196
They're with Van this week.

56:10.075 --> 56:10.450
Uh-huh.

56:11.993 --> 56:13.244
Uh, put him through.

56:15.997 --> 56:17.082
Duane, what you got?

56:17.165 --> 56:20.001
Peterson was standing
over her

56:20.085 --> 56:21.086
when he beat her.

56:21.169 --> 56:22.921
The speck of blood
on the inside

56:23.004 --> 56:24.380
of his shorts?

56:24.464 --> 56:25.090
The blood flew upwards.

56:25.173 --> 56:27.509
And that was the last piece.

56:27.592 --> 56:29.094
We've managed to replicate
this crime scene

56:29.177 --> 56:32.097
to a tee with the blow poke.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.264
You got yourself
a murder weapon, sir.

56:33.348 --> 56:36.601
I'm looking forward
to testifying for you.

56:36.684 --> 56:37.435
Great work, Duane.

56:37.519 --> 56:40.313
Hot damn.
Uh, send that report.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.317
I knew it.

56:48.029 --> 56:50.490
I could feel it in my gut.

57:02.085 --> 57:04.963
I never told you this before,

57:05.046 --> 57:06.381
but, um...

57:07.715 --> 57:10.468
I lost my brother
and sisters in a house fire

57:10.552 --> 57:12.345
when I was 13.

57:13.054 --> 57:14.722
Jack was ten

57:14.806 --> 57:16.307
and my two little sisters...

57:18.059 --> 57:19.352
they were even younger.

57:21.521 --> 57:22.438
Sophie-Anne and Mary.

57:27.902 --> 57:28.319
I got out.

57:29.988 --> 57:32.323
But... they didn't.

57:35.076 --> 57:37.036
I'm so sorry, Jim.

57:38.580 --> 57:40.999
Terrible things just happen.

57:41.082 --> 57:42.417
You know.

57:46.212 --> 57:48.381
Innocent children
can burn up in a fire.

57:55.263 --> 57:58.850
And women can trip
and fall down the stairs

57:58.933 --> 58:00.018
for no reason.

58:04.814 --> 58:06.191
They can.

58:11.946 --> 58:13.031
Start filing a motion.

58:13.823 --> 58:15.658
We're gonna have to dig her up.

58:17.285 --> 58:19.787
We'll need permission
from next of kin.

58:20.622 --> 58:22.207
The girls could say no.

58:23.374 --> 58:23.583
They could.

58:26.502 --> 58:28.880
If they find out she died
of natural causes,

58:28.963 --> 58:30.673
like the original
autopsy said...

58:32.091 --> 58:33.885
it's gonna look bad for us.

58:35.136 --> 58:36.387
Maybe.

58:40.350 --> 58:42.393
Or maybe we all
find out the truth.

58:47.023 --> 58:49.484
Let the games begin.

58:49.567 --> 58:52.820
"To the esteemed lawyers
who are pursuing the prosecution

58:52.904 --> 58:54.113
"of our father,
Michael Peterson.

58:54.197 --> 58:56.616
"we are writing to convey

58:56.699 --> 58:59.077
"our feelings of distress
in this matter.

58:59.160 --> 59:01.663
"However, seeing that
you have no compassion

59:01.746 --> 59:03.373
"for the memory of our mother,

59:03.456 --> 59:05.833
"we reluctantly consent
to your request

59:05.917 --> 59:07.627
"to exhume
our mother's body.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.674
"We are confident
that you will conclude

59:12.757 --> 59:15.426
"what experts concluded
almost 20 years ago,

59:15.510 --> 59:19.138
"that our mother died
of a brain aneurysm

59:20.098 --> 59:22.058
"and that our father,
Michael Peterson,

59:22.141 --> 59:25.311
"will be vindicated
of these outrageous claims.

59:25.395 --> 59:28.356
Sincerely yours,
Margaret and Martha Ratliff."

59:30.191 --> 59:31.526
Thank you.

59:33.403 --> 59:35.363
Of course, Dad.
Anything.

1:00:21.784 --> 1:00:23.202
Hold the door, please.

1:00:49.812 --> 1:00:53.232
You're going to be smiling
in prison soon, you prick.

1:01:36.359 --> 1:01:37.944
All rise.

1:01:41.155 --> 1:01:43.116
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

1:01:43.199 --> 1:01:44.367
This honorable court
for the County of Durham

1:01:44.450 --> 1:01:47.578
is now open and sitting for
the dispatch of its business.

1:01:47.662 --> 1:01:51.749
The Honorable
Judge Orlando Hudson presiding.

1:01:51.833 --> 1:01:53.709
God save the state
and this honorable court.

1:01:56.212 --> 1:01:57.630
You may be seated.

1:01:59.257 --> 1:02:01.426
-And good morning.
-Good morning, Your Honor.

1:02:01.509 --> 1:02:03.010
This court is now prepared
to hear the case

1:02:03.094 --> 1:02:05.555
of the state versus
Michael Iver Peterson.

1:02:05.638 --> 1:02:08.599
Mr. Hardin, you may proceed
with your opening.

1:02:08.683 --> 1:02:09.892
Thank you, Your Honor.

1:02:22.196 --> 1:02:23.906
Good morning.

1:02:23.990 --> 1:02:26.617
In a very real sense,

1:02:26.701 --> 1:02:28.953
this case is about pretense

1:02:29.036 --> 1:02:30.455
and appearances.

1:02:32.373 --> 1:02:35.042
It's about things
not being as they seem.

1:02:36.544 --> 1:02:40.214
One, two, three, four.
