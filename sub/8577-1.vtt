01:31.509 --> 01:34.136
I'm too old for this.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.007
Damn desert.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.325
- Code name?
- Anacleto.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.868
You can't smoke here.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.456
Goddamn anti-smoking law.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.460
No one's been here in a while.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.713
Sometimes you have to come
to the asshole of the world

03:32.880 --> 03:34.340
to clean up the shit.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.761
Anacleto, I've been in here
for 10 years because of you!

03:38.928 --> 03:41.722
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...!
Shit, I can't think of anything!

03:41.889 --> 03:44.141
- Me neither!
- My mind's gone blank.

03:44.350 --> 03:45.559
I had a great one.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.853
You're a popular guy round here.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.147
My fan club.
I'll miss them when I retire.

03:50.356 --> 03:52.858
I've got one, I wrote it down.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.361
But reading it out ruins it.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.005
Anacleto.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.509
Vázquez.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.181
What's it been, 30 years?
You can tell.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.976
You look better with long hair.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.691
I see you thought about me a lot.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.278
When you have one aim in life,

04:37.444 --> 04:39.947
- you devote time to it.
- Don't worry,

04:40.114 --> 04:42.700
I'm here to take you
to a smaller, dirtier prison.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.704
You'll have the next 20 years
to plaster your cell with sketches.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.928
You know what's a shame?
They're closing the GP.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.806
It seems you're no longer necessary.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.100
So many years fighting
criminals like me...

05:08.309 --> 05:11.478
- and budget cuts get you.
- You seem annoyed at me.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.148
I've been in prison for 30 years
because of you.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.191
Believe me, "annoyed" isn't the word.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.653
Now you can spend more time
with your son.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.032
You do have a son, right?

05:24.825 --> 05:27.578
It's amazing what you find out
in solitary confinement.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.665
Don't mention my son again!

06:02.780 --> 06:05.157
The saw, quick!

06:05.366 --> 06:08.160
- I forgot it.
- What?! Get these cuffs off!

06:08.369 --> 06:11.080
Goddamn mask!

06:11.246 --> 06:13.874
What with the bazooka,
it slipped our minds.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.542
The Butcher and the Molecule.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.587
I see you still get the top men.

06:18.754 --> 06:20.881
What was your catchphrase?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.800
"Anacleto never fails"?

06:24.259 --> 06:26.845
It doesn't seem
very accurate now, does it?

06:27.012 --> 06:30.140
It doesn't look like
your plan worked out either.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.559
You don't know my plan yet.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.145
- It's to kill you and your son!
- No!

06:36.855 --> 06:38.232
This has only just begun.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.470
Watch it with the weed, eh?

07:08.637 --> 07:11.348
- No one can see us.
- A little respect, I'm your boss

07:11.557 --> 07:13.600
and you're hoggin' the joint.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.811
Here, boss.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.813
Some boss...

07:22.693 --> 07:24.736
- Another tough night at work.
- You got it.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.698
If I'd listened to my dad,
I'd be shoveling shit right now.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.533
Change the channel.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.955
Here goes.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.384
- What do we do?
- I don't know, you're the boss.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.511
But I'm no dictator,
I want your opinion.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.264
I don't fancy going down
and tangling with those creeps.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.807
Do we call the cops?

07:54.725 --> 07:56.727
By the time they arrive,
those TVs will be in the Ukraine.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.937
There'd be a report,
paperwork, a mess.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.899
Besides, the company allows for
robberies in the price.

08:02.065 --> 08:05.068
We're watchdogs, right?
We watch, we don't fight.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.279
So, we're watching.

08:07.988 --> 08:08.989
Shall we put on a movie?

08:46.902 --> 08:50.280
Katia, can you turn down
the music, please?

08:52.574 --> 08:55.786
Sure, go ahead, sleep.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.625
We had a tough night.
We kind of got robbed...

09:01.833 --> 09:04.253
In the hospital we had it easy.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.964
Twiddling our thumbs
the whole time.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.758
Being Friday,
people didn't go nuts,

09:09.925 --> 09:12.177
no alcoholic comas
or accidents...

09:12.344 --> 09:14.888
And I could've spent
another hour in bed, but no,

09:15.055 --> 09:17.558
I'd rather pick you up
in the asshole of the world.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.977
- Okay.
- I've got an idea:

09:20.143 --> 09:22.479
You could get your driver's license.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.815
I know, I just don't have time.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.733
Working at night...

09:31.863 --> 09:33.907
Why did you stop the car?
We're not there.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.328
We have to talk.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.876
Adolfo, I'm tired of arguing
about the same thing.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.879
Then we can keep quiet.
Like this...

09:48.046 --> 09:51.341
That's the problem,
you never say or do anything.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.594
You spend all day on the couch.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.306
Couch-movie-blanket,
that's all you want from life.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.057
You like it too.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.102
And when we watch TV series?
We get under the blankets,

10:02.269 --> 10:05.105
with some pizzas... it's great.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.524
But I don't want to live on a couch.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.401
- No.
- And you know it.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.277
Yes.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.154
I got myself a ticket to India.

10:12.904 --> 10:13.989
Jesus!

10:14.156 --> 10:17.117
I got into World Doctors again,
and this time I'm sorry, but...

10:17.284 --> 10:19.995
- I'm no waiting for you to decide.
- I was coming with you.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.372
- Really?
- The time wasn't right.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.207
- No?
- No.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.626
In six years?

10:25.792 --> 10:28.503
- It slipped by.
- You don't even have a passport.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.216
I'm really sorry, I am.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.928
- I love you.
- Me too!

10:37.095 --> 10:38.095
Wait, wait.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.726
I know you'll never budge from here.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.147
And I need... other things.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.568
I need adventure and excitement.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.031
And I know I'll never
have that with you.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.660
What is all this?

11:01.286 --> 11:02.496
Are you leaving me?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.122
It's all set.

11:04.289 --> 11:08.126
I'm going in a week.
I'll stay at my mom's until then.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.548
What about me?
Are you leaving me in the boonies.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.801
Sorry, I'll take you where you want,

11:18.553 --> 11:20.013
but we're finished.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.074
Dad, are you ever going to answer?

12:01.888 --> 12:04.224
What was in the van?
Where's the merchandise?

12:05.267 --> 12:07.018
I don't want any rugs, thanks.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.646
- The waiter thinks he's funny.
- Looks stupid.

12:09.855 --> 12:10.897
I'm gonna kill him.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.567
- We can get a ransom from Spain.
- You speak Spanish.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.402
- I'll make you a deal.
- Go on.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.238
You give me your Jeep,
your guns and all your cash,

12:18.405 --> 12:21.366
you stay in this damn desert
without water or provisions.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.201
Now comes the good part:

12:23.368 --> 12:26.371
I promise, before I leave the country,
I'll visit your wives.

12:26.872 --> 12:30.083
Don't get me wrong,
I'll be gentle:

12:30.250 --> 12:33.837
dinner, champagne, candles,
all that stuff.

12:34.004 --> 12:39.342
They'll love it and thank me
by naming your future kids after me.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.095
Anacleto.
How do you like the deal?

12:42.554 --> 12:45.640
<i>Anacleto! What is this crap?</i>

12:53.023 --> 12:54.357
Anacleto never fails.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.905
- <i>Code name?</i>
- Anacleto.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.242
<i>Boss, it's Anacleto.</i>

13:05.368 --> 13:07.788
About time! What took you
so long to get in touch?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.331
You know the game's sacred.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.042
I had to pair up with Rentero,
who can't back me

13:12.209 --> 13:14.795
when I bluff big.
I can't believe he's a spy!

13:14.961 --> 13:17.506
Boss, they knew the route,
they were expecting us.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.633
Unbelievable! And Vázquez?

13:19.841 --> 13:21.843
He blew up the van and got away.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.846
He knows I have a son.
Adolfo must be protected.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.850
Let's go! I want a special unit!
Close the borders!

13:29.017 --> 13:32.604
Polita, I want a passenger list
for all departing flights!

13:32.813 --> 13:36.274
We haven't had the budget
for border agents for years,

13:36.441 --> 13:37.484
you should know that.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.653
<i>Send me a helicopter!</i>

13:39.861 --> 13:42.113
Sure, with jacuzzi included!

13:42.280 --> 13:45.033
We don't have the budget for
a helicopter, you should know that!

13:45.325 --> 13:47.828
You'll have to get out alone,
you know the score.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.330
At least send someone
to watch Adolfo.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.542
I'll send two agents,
but their overtime

13:53.708 --> 13:55.001
comes out of your severance pay.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.171
I'm too old for this.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.264
Listen to me, she's a bitch,
you don't need her.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.225
We're fine right here
with our booze, our buddies,

14:10.392 --> 14:13.895
sexually available women,
free peanuts...

14:14.062 --> 14:17.274
I'm allergic. One peanut
and my heart stops, I die.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.442
- But I don't care.
- I do!

14:19.609 --> 14:23.071
They're out of peanuts.
Look at the babes here.

14:23.238 --> 14:26.074
- Are you allergic to them too?
- I don't like any of them,

14:26.241 --> 14:27.409
none of them are like Katia.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.663
Get over it, man.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.999
Katia just walked by.

14:36.793 --> 14:37.793
Let's go.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.883
- I'll tell that bitch!
- Martin, no! Come here!

14:43.383 --> 14:44.383
Martin!

14:45.510 --> 14:49.347
You're going to India
to save the world, like Ghandi?

14:49.514 --> 14:53.268
And Adolfo? Would Ghandi have
left his boyfriend on the roadside?

14:53.435 --> 14:55.562
Why do you care if we break up?

14:55.729 --> 14:56.938
I care.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.941
He's my friend and my subordinate.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.694
If he's afraid to tell you, I will.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.487
I think he's a big boy

15:04.654 --> 15:06.740
who doesn't need anyone
to defend him, much less you.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.367
She's right.
Shall we go, Martin?

15:09.534 --> 15:12.412
You're safe because your girl friends
are here, otherwise...

15:12.579 --> 15:15.457
- Otherwise you'd hit me?
- Maybe, yeah.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.251
What happens when you get hurt?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.670
Will you run to Mom,
like you always do?

15:20.837 --> 15:23.590
You've never won a fight
with me your whole life!

15:25.425 --> 15:26.425
Idiot!

15:31.431 --> 15:32.682
Not the hair!

15:34.225 --> 15:35.435
Not the hair!

15:46.237 --> 15:47.405
What the hell's going on?

15:47.572 --> 15:49.783
Relax, it's a brother-sister fight.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.035
- You know what it's like.
- No, I don't.

16:01.252 --> 16:05.006
Balls, eh? She always goes for
your hair or your balls.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.222
You're crazy!
He could've killed us!

16:12.389 --> 16:14.265
I needed that!

16:15.475 --> 16:17.519
He took the kick meant for me.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.771
Either you or my brother.

16:43.128 --> 16:46.256
With all we've done,
now we're babysitters.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.926
You bet. Remember that mission
in Antarctica?

16:50.135 --> 16:52.679
When they shot at us
with nuclear missiles?

16:52.846 --> 16:54.966
And that mess with
the King's double mess in Bulgaria?

16:55.098 --> 16:57.934
- And the Pakonia mummy?
- And Operation Heliotrope?

16:58.143 --> 16:59.811
And the Moon Storm mission?

17:00.854 --> 17:03.273
- We were big dogs.
- Yeah.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.443
But we don't have a photo.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.862
True, but it's all up here.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.797
Adolfo, what are you doing?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.969
I don't know. Hugging you?

17:34.929 --> 17:37.682
I know what happened,
you had second thoughts.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.642
This is classic making up sex.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.312
No, Adolfo. It's...

17:43.772 --> 17:45.982
classic goodbye sex.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.943
I'm leaving in a week.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.906
- What?
- Sorry if I confused you.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.076
The goodbye in the car was so dull,
I thought this was better.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.834
- I'm going.
- Where? This is your place too.

18:54.509 --> 18:57.929
You want to rob me?
Take the big TV, it's all yours.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.473
You want my card?
The PIN's easy: 1234.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.760
Here, the ATM on the corner
doesn't charge commission.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.352
Damn!

19:10.275 --> 19:11.275
Damn!

19:17.240 --> 19:18.449
Hey, are you okay?

19:19.909 --> 19:22.370
Rob me, but don't hit me.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.664
Damn, look at that!

19:32.755 --> 19:33.798
Hold on, let's talk.

19:34.799 --> 19:35.799
No.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.400
Let's leave it at that, eh?

21:10.895 --> 21:11.938
Katia...

21:13.439 --> 21:14.524
Katia.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.901
Katia, I think
I just killed a Chinaman.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.449
Maybe I should call the cops.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.326
It was an accident, but...

21:45.596 --> 21:46.681
Adolfo.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.602
What did you do to your face?

21:51.769 --> 21:52.854
Where?

21:56.024 --> 21:57.024
The Chinaman!

21:57.900 --> 21:58.985
Wait here.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.533
He's not here now,
but there was a Chinaman.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.121
He came in
and started hitting me.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.832
He tossed me over there.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.626
Suddenly, I started fighting back.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.754
I threw him down here, hard.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.506
It must be the videogames,
I've never hit anyone.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.675
Why did you do that to your face?

22:22.842 --> 22:26.387
- Is this self harm so I'd pity you?
- I swear, it wasn't me.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.847
There was a dead Chinaman here.

22:28.014 --> 22:31.684
There was blood everywhere,
he grabbed me...

22:32.935 --> 22:34.812
I stuck your vibrator in his mouth...

22:37.940 --> 22:39.984
- How long have you had this?
- Don't change the subject.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.570
- Okay.
- What did you do to your face?

22:42.737 --> 22:45.031
I swear...
How could I do this?

22:45.198 --> 22:48.451
When I said "adventure and excitement"
you though I meant this?

22:48.618 --> 22:50.787
- It's true!
- Don't make this weirder

22:50.953 --> 22:53.539
- or harder than it already is.
- But...

22:53.956 --> 22:54.957
Adolfo,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.293
we're not getting back together.

23:16.521 --> 23:17.605
Adolfo.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.066
Dad, what are you doing here?

23:20.233 --> 23:23.194
It's been ages
since we spent the day together.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.738
I decided to take you home,
make your favorite food

23:25.905 --> 23:27.281
and have a chat.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.700
- Seriously?
- What do you think?

23:29.909 --> 23:33.204
I'm on a deli delivery,
but now I'm here...

23:33.871 --> 23:35.915
- What's with the bags?
- Nothing,

23:36.082 --> 23:39.460
I'm moving out temporarily. Katia
and I thought it was for the best.

23:39.836 --> 23:40.837
She kicked you out?

23:41.963 --> 23:44.006
- We've split up.
- And she beat you up.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.592
- I don't know why I tell you.
- Hold on!

23:46.759 --> 23:48.594
- I'll give you a lift.
- Okay.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.222
But I'm not talking,
because I don't feel like it

23:51.431 --> 23:53.099
- and you make fun of me.
- Fine.

23:53.266 --> 23:56.185
Give me your bags,
the back's full of sausage

23:56.352 --> 23:58.688
- and you'll squash it.
- Fine.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.992
To India, no less.

24:11.159 --> 24:14.620
She can't be a doctor here,
it has to be halfway round the world.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.956
She complains that I have
no driver's license, I'm dull

24:17.123 --> 24:18.332
and she wants adventure.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.793
She's no party either.
When I want to play videogames

24:20.960 --> 24:24.172
she says "I'm tired from the hospital".
Who's the boring one?

24:24.839 --> 24:26.257
Why didn't you get your license?

24:26.466 --> 24:27.925
You promised to teach me!

24:28.092 --> 24:30.344
When you were 18,
you've had time since then.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.806
Why do you never tell me
positive stuff when I'm down?

24:33.973 --> 24:37.310
Say: "She's a bitch,
she doesn't deserve you,

24:37.518 --> 24:39.896
she'll be all alone
her whole life..." Say that.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.857
I could, but I don't like lying.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.777
Were you nicer to Mom?

24:46.944 --> 24:49.572
Your mother?
You were too young to remember,

24:49.739 --> 24:52.909
but she had a natural talent
for twisting the knife.

24:53.075 --> 24:56.287
A moving family moment.
I'm taking a nap.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.247
Sapristi! What's up, Sapristi?

25:40.581 --> 25:41.832
Come here.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.252
My dog Sapristi.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.380
Adolfo.

25:48.673 --> 25:49.673
Adolfo.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.717
You must be starving.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.762
I can make us something to eat.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.852
Don't worry son,
I'll take care of everything.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.381
CALL

26:41.183 --> 26:42.393
MY DIARY

26:47.148 --> 26:49.442
<i>The other day it snowed
and it was fun</i>

26:49.650 --> 26:51.777
<i>because I made a snowman
in the garden.</i>

26:51.944 --> 26:55.239
<i>Dad said it was crap
with a mouth and nose.</i>

26:55.406 --> 26:59.327
<i>So I told him
his sausages were crap</i>

26:59.493 --> 27:02.413
<i>and the son of a bitch
could shove them us his ass.</i>

27:02.622 --> 27:04.790
<i>He didn't like me saying
"son of a bitch",</i>

27:04.957 --> 27:07.960
<i>but I kept yelling
"son of a bitch, son of a bitch..."</i>

27:08.127 --> 27:10.921
<i>until the creep locked me
in my room.</i>

27:11.088 --> 27:13.424
<i>I'll never make a snowman again!</i>

27:34.570 --> 27:35.905
- Yes?
- <i>Everything okay?</i>

27:36.072 --> 27:38.991
All clean.
Do we know Vázquez's whereabouts?

27:39.158 --> 27:42.078
<i>Leave it to me.
You two sit tight there</i>

27:42.244 --> 27:44.372
<i>- until things calm down.</i>
- Alright.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.176
What's that sound?
What are you doing?

30:04.470 --> 30:07.097
Nothing, son, I just dropped a pot.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.977
- You're weird.
- No, don't worry.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.687
I'll tidy it up.

30:13.896 --> 30:16.440
I wasn't going to.
I wanted some cookies.

30:32.331 --> 30:35.334
Damn it!
You bought walnut cookies again!

30:35.709 --> 30:38.337
I almost had an allergic attack!

30:42.049 --> 30:44.093
I don't have much time to explain.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.636
Why are you doing that?

30:46.679 --> 30:49.223
I wasn't going to tell you,
but it doesn't matter now.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.270
I'm a secret agent.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.438
A secret agent?

31:02.361 --> 31:03.612
What are you talking about?

31:03.779 --> 31:04.947
It's the truth.

31:05.114 --> 31:07.408
The farm's a front,
I've worked for the GP for years.

31:07.575 --> 31:10.077
The GP?
What does that mean?

31:10.244 --> 31:12.997
It's the agency's name.
Who cares? The Boss made it up.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.583
- Who's "the Boss"?
- It's a code name.

31:15.749 --> 31:18.043
Oh, a code name.
And what's yours?

31:19.378 --> 31:20.379
Anacleto.

31:21.672 --> 31:24.633
"Anacleto, Secret Agent".
You just made that up!

31:24.800 --> 31:26.302
No, don't come any closer.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.889
Look, we don't have much time.

31:31.098 --> 31:33.183
Tell me, who are you?

31:33.350 --> 31:35.102
You're a psychopath, right?

31:44.528 --> 31:46.697
I knew it was weird:
you're alone all day,

31:46.906 --> 31:48.449
shut up here with that shitty dog.

31:48.699 --> 31:51.619
You've developed a rational
hatred for society.

31:51.785 --> 31:53.829
You're into shredding people.

31:54.038 --> 31:56.248
- What?
- You fit the profile.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.626
What profile?
Don't talk rubbish!

31:58.792 --> 32:01.272
The profile. A man alone,
distant, unaffectionate, talks weird.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.339
Who's talking rubbish now?

32:04.423 --> 32:07.259
You're way off track, son.

32:09.345 --> 32:12.222
Tell me that the sausage
you've crammed into me all my life

32:12.389 --> 32:16.101
didn't have human flesh,
they were just nice and homemade.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.270
It was the meat.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.565
Is that really more credible
than me being a secret agent?

32:24.109 --> 32:25.109
Get down!

32:26.820 --> 32:27.820
The table!

32:31.742 --> 32:34.453
- They're here!
- What the hell's going on?

32:34.620 --> 32:38.248
So, a cannibal or a secret agent?
Have you got it now?

32:38.415 --> 32:40.535
I don't know! Who are they?
Why are they attacking us?

32:40.668 --> 32:42.461
The goons of Vázquez,
my arch-enemy.

32:42.628 --> 32:43.712
Your what?

32:44.838 --> 32:47.257
Your arch-enemy?

32:50.010 --> 32:51.053
What are you saying?

32:52.638 --> 32:53.639
Where are you going now?

33:05.776 --> 33:07.569
You keep chewing gum in there?

33:09.029 --> 33:12.116
Here. They're coming in.
Shoot to kill.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.494
Are you nuts? I can't do that.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.288
Yes, you can. Look at me.

33:18.455 --> 33:20.666
You're confused, but you're ready.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.168
I'm a guard at Electro Market.
I don't even have a club.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.712
Trust me, I trained you.

33:24.878 --> 33:27.256
You trained me? When?

33:27.423 --> 33:30.134
All your life.
Don't you remember?

33:32.386 --> 33:35.889
<i>Let's fly, Adolfo,
you'll see, it'll be fun.</i>

33:37.224 --> 33:40.352
<i>It's been over for a long time,</i>

33:40.519 --> 33:42.354
<i>but some things</i>

33:42.521 --> 33:45.733
<i>you never forget,</i>

33:45.899 --> 33:49.194
<i>however much time passes.</i>

34:04.460 --> 34:05.627
You're a psycho.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.421
I knew it'd come in handy.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.922
- You had no right.
- It was handy with the Chinaman.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.217
The Chinaman? I knew it!

34:12.801 --> 34:15.219
I knew I didn't dream it,
and Katia didn't believe me!

34:19.516 --> 34:20.516
One down.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.480
You're chewing gum now?

34:24.646 --> 34:26.690
It's a bomb. Take cover!

34:33.864 --> 34:34.907
Look out! Shoot!

34:47.335 --> 34:48.920
Beginner's luck.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.509
- What have you turned me into?
- We have to go.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.512
They're all dead, I killed them.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.681
These people had family, friends...

34:59.848 --> 35:03.602
If they had kids,
how much misery is that?

35:03.769 --> 35:06.146
- You didn't feel anything?
- Yes, the recoil.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.440
- So you're made of ice.
- If it makes you feel better,

35:08.607 --> 35:10.234
it was them or us.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.445
But I haven't done anything,
people like me.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.532
They don't want to be BFFs,
but they don't want to kill me.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.785
It's my fault. They're after you
in order to hurt me.

35:21.745 --> 35:24.790
You barely notice me,
they should've gone for the dog.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.597
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he's yours.

35:27.835 --> 35:28.919
Sapristi!

35:30.754 --> 35:31.755
Sapristi!

35:33.298 --> 35:35.259
- No, no, no!
- Stop! Stop!

35:35.425 --> 35:36.425
Get down!

35:53.819 --> 35:55.362
Sapristi...

35:55.529 --> 35:58.699
We have to go now
and forget the farm forever.

35:58.866 --> 36:01.034
I will forget it,
but I'm not going with you,

36:01.243 --> 36:02.661
I'm going to the police.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.873
- I don't have time to argue.
- Neither do I!

36:09.751 --> 36:11.920
Admit it, you were a bit stubborn.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.297
Unbelievable.

36:14.381 --> 36:15.841
And you smoke too.

36:16.925 --> 36:17.593
What?

36:17.759 --> 36:20.804
And you smoke too,
you've smoked all your life.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.473
Okay.
What was Mom, a ninja?

36:24.892 --> 36:27.728
A spy.
The best, until she died.

36:27.936 --> 36:31.648
We wanted to keep you out of it,
so we kept it a secret.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.611
This is routine for you.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.740
- How many have you killed?
- What does it matter?

36:39.907 --> 36:42.951
No, now we're on the subject,
I'd rather you told me.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.704
More than 10?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.248
Yes, more than 10,
but they all deserved it.

36:50.459 --> 36:51.627
More than 50?

36:51.793 --> 36:53.503
Yes, more than 50.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.506
- More than 100?
- I guess, yes, hundreds.

36:56.673 --> 36:59.927
Hundreds?! 400? 500?

37:00.093 --> 37:02.512
Under a thousand.
Happy now?

37:02.679 --> 37:04.514
What?
That's a genocidal number!

37:04.681 --> 37:06.475
It's no big deal.

37:06.642 --> 37:09.770
Spread over 30 years on the job,
it's two or three a month.

37:09.937 --> 37:12.564
Sure, if you spread it out,
I'm fine with that.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.900
What about you? Four in two days.

37:20.656 --> 37:22.449
<i>75.</i>

37:24.910 --> 37:26.328
<i>9.</i>

37:28.914 --> 37:31.708
<i>22, two little ducks...</i>

37:33.877 --> 37:36.129
The money's still not in my account.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.885
I need you to do one last thing.

37:42.052 --> 37:45.639
What more do you want?
I told you where the farm was.

37:45.806 --> 37:49.434
I betrayed one of my top agents,
my friend, my partner at cards.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.271
I know and I appreciate it,
but it's complicated now.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.569
What letter's this?

38:01.488 --> 38:03.699
Gum-Two-Echo.
It's a "G", obviously.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.784
Can you be quiet, please?

38:06.868 --> 38:09.121
Those explosives can't leave the GP.

38:09.329 --> 38:11.790
I fulfilled my part of the plan.
C'mon, the briefcase.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.713
Jeez, what a pain!

38:18.755 --> 38:21.425
From now on,
you're on your own.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.596
What is this crap?

38:26.763 --> 38:28.140
When I was in prison

38:28.348 --> 38:31.435
my henchmen invested all the money
in that stamp scam, Forum.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.563
But they'll go up in value.
In a few years you'll be

38:34.730 --> 38:38.442
a millionaire... almost for sure.
Or in a few months.

38:38.608 --> 38:41.862
No excuses.
You have 24 hours to get the money,

38:42.029 --> 38:45.240
or I'll use all my resources
to put an end to you.

38:45.449 --> 38:48.702
Cut it out! You can't smoke here,
it's a bingo hall.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.998
I'm leaving, lady.

38:53.165 --> 38:55.000
And none too soon.

38:55.167 --> 38:58.378
- Bingo!
- Oh, damn it!

39:10.515 --> 39:11.683
The GP.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.687
Just like the Pentagon.

39:20.734 --> 39:23.070
This building isn't in
the architecture books

39:23.236 --> 39:24.738
or tourist magazines,

39:24.905 --> 39:27.616
but it's the pillar
that holds this country up.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.117
But this is the post office.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.037
You share offices with them?

39:32.204 --> 39:35.957
Cutbacks... Not even
national security is a priority.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.709
Dad, how much do you make?

39:37.876 --> 39:40.545
There's a basic salary,
then a variable percentage.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.174
Yes, but at the end of the month,
after extras, how much?

39:44.383 --> 39:45.384
Really? Before tax?

39:45.550 --> 39:48.804
- Then there's the six-yearly bonus.
- You make less than I do.

39:53.642 --> 39:55.811
"Spanish omelet is always round".

39:55.977 --> 39:58.021
Seriously? That's your password?

39:58.188 --> 39:59.523
What's wrong with it?

40:15.789 --> 40:18.667
Nice place, Dad, very modern.
Where are the people?

40:18.834 --> 40:22.129
- It's coffee break.
- Right, they're civil servants.

40:24.297 --> 40:26.675
Someone's blocking the door.
This is fishy.

40:26.842 --> 40:27.842
Fishy...

40:41.857 --> 40:42.858
Damn!

40:52.826 --> 40:53.952
Poison.

40:55.162 --> 40:57.581
Gee, lucky we came here.

40:57.747 --> 41:01.543
I feel super safe.
Now what's the plan?

41:01.710 --> 41:05.130
There's a meeting place,
in case of emergency.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.299
If there's an agent alive,
he'll go there.

41:11.470 --> 41:12.888
Damn it!

41:19.895 --> 41:20.896
What are you doing?

41:22.230 --> 41:23.857
Sending Katia a WhatsApp

41:24.024 --> 41:26.401
with a photo of the dead agents

41:26.610 --> 41:29.321
to prove that the Chinaman was true.

41:29.529 --> 41:32.866
They were my friends,
you could at least pretend to care.

41:34.284 --> 41:37.162
I could, yes,
but I don't like lying.

41:58.225 --> 41:59.226
Push 'up'!

42:04.105 --> 42:05.941
They're not from the GP.

42:06.107 --> 42:08.610
Dad, you're hit, right there.

42:08.777 --> 42:10.362
- Vázquez.
<i>- Hey!</i>

42:10.570 --> 42:13.657
Anacleto, there you are.
How was your stroll in the desert?

42:14.032 --> 42:16.034
You killed all my friends.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.328
I won't stop
until I finish you all off.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.210
I want them alive!

42:27.128 --> 42:28.338
The stairs!

42:29.548 --> 42:30.548
Hold it!

42:32.217 --> 42:33.468
This way.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.849
Block the door!

42:40.100 --> 42:41.100
What?

42:49.985 --> 42:53.071
- This way!
- I'm not getting up there.

42:56.741 --> 43:00.579
- We have no choice. C'mon!
- I'm not getting up there!

43:00.787 --> 43:01.830
Open the door!

43:07.586 --> 43:09.226
- No way I'm jumping!
- What do you weigh?

43:09.421 --> 43:10.922
80 kilos.

43:11.089 --> 43:14.092
- The truck's canvas can take it.
- I'm 85 kilos, it won't.

43:14.384 --> 43:17.095
Trust me, son.
Anacleto never fails.

43:17.262 --> 43:19.014
No! No, no...!

43:24.311 --> 43:25.311
Jeez, Dad!

43:34.279 --> 43:36.156
Come on, it's no big deal!

43:36.323 --> 43:39.200
I'm 90 kilos.
I've always had heavy bones!

43:58.553 --> 44:01.556
Don't get cocky, at your age
I jumped from much higher.

44:01.765 --> 44:02.766
Sure, sure...

44:03.683 --> 44:04.683
Run!

44:11.566 --> 44:14.861
- We need a hospital.
- No, it's too dangerous.

44:15.028 --> 44:17.113
No! Dad!

44:22.160 --> 44:25.580
Oooh, it's scrummy!
Finger licking good!

44:27.165 --> 44:28.958
- I want a drumstick.
- So do I!

44:29.125 --> 44:30.669
- Smart ass!
- I want a drumstick too!

44:30.835 --> 44:32.587
- It's my farewell.
- Then say goodbye to the drumstick.

44:32.796 --> 44:34.714
Say goodbye to your teeth.

44:34.881 --> 44:38.176
Cut it out!
There's chicken for everyone!

44:38.343 --> 44:41.179
Let's see if we can eat
like a normal family for once!

44:41.346 --> 44:42.681
Who the hell is that?

44:45.684 --> 44:47.310
Want some? For your farewell.

44:48.478 --> 44:50.105
I'll get it. You idiot!

44:53.775 --> 44:55.151
You two are the limit!

44:57.779 --> 44:59.114
- Adolfo...
- Hi.

44:59.572 --> 45:01.783
It's not my blood, it's my dad's.

45:01.950 --> 45:04.077
He got shot, he's dying.
You have to help us.

45:04.244 --> 45:06.454
Not this crap to get attention again?

45:06.621 --> 45:08.206
No, look at him.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.083
My God!
We have to get him to hospital!

45:10.250 --> 45:11.835
Keep your voice down!
We can't!

45:12.001 --> 45:13.503
We can't?
I'm calling an ambulance!

45:13.712 --> 45:15.338
Shut up and listen!

45:15.505 --> 45:18.133
They tried to kill us,
they're after us.

45:18.299 --> 45:19.718
Katia, whatcha doin'?!

45:19.884 --> 45:22.053
Nothing, Mom, it's Adolfo.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.980
Tell him to come in,
we got loads of chicken!

45:24.055 --> 45:25.557
But he gets the breast!

45:25.765 --> 45:29.519
This is going to be hard
to believe, but my father...

45:29.728 --> 45:30.979
is a secret agent.

45:33.606 --> 45:34.816
Please.

45:35.650 --> 45:38.319
Whatcha doin'?!
You comin' in or not?!

45:38.486 --> 45:40.780
No, Mom, we're going to my room...

45:41.823 --> 45:43.241
- ...to talk!
- "Talk", she says.

45:43.491 --> 45:45.076
They're gonna have sex.

45:45.243 --> 45:47.579
Here, in your house,
the day of her farewell.

45:47.787 --> 45:49.164
And before dessert.

45:49.330 --> 45:51.374
You're jealous because
he's not here to see you.

45:51.541 --> 45:53.585
Get over this complex
about your sister.

45:53.793 --> 45:55.003
You're 33 years old.

45:55.170 --> 45:58.173
Maybe because you dressed me
in her clothes until I was 11.

45:58.339 --> 46:01.885
You gotta use that 2-for-1 discount.
Now eat up!

46:02.093 --> 46:05.096
This is crazy.
He needs anesthetics and surgery.

46:06.514 --> 46:08.391
Take it easy.
Apply pressure.

46:10.059 --> 46:10.727
Adolfo!

46:10.894 --> 46:14.063
Don't relapse. Naturally you're
all gooey 'cause she's leaving,

46:14.230 --> 46:15.230
but be strong.

46:15.356 --> 46:18.818
She gives great blowjobs and does
that finger thing, but hold out.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.946
You told my brother
what we do in bed?

46:23.990 --> 46:26.409
We're shut in for hours,
things come up.

46:26.576 --> 46:29.120
- But I make you sound amazing.
- Really?

46:30.455 --> 46:33.583
That's it, you're doing it.
You had a relapse!

46:35.126 --> 46:37.545
Martin, get in here, we need you!

46:37.712 --> 46:40.882
Hey, I don't know,
we're brother and sister.

46:41.049 --> 46:43.218
I've fantasized about it,

46:43.384 --> 46:45.929
- but this is heavy stuff.
- Get in here!

46:46.638 --> 46:48.223
Jesus! What have you done?

46:48.389 --> 46:49.599
Grab his legs!

46:51.976 --> 46:53.728
Don't say a word!

46:53.937 --> 46:55.855
I never say anything.

46:56.022 --> 46:57.899
Who insisted on a liberal education,

46:58.066 --> 47:01.194
talking about sex at home
and the liberal media? Who?

47:01.361 --> 47:04.405
A good thrashing
is what they needed!

47:07.283 --> 47:10.203
So the farm, the sausage,
and that hick look

47:10.370 --> 47:11.579
was all a front?

47:13.706 --> 47:15.542
- So it seems.
- So your whole life

47:15.708 --> 47:17.001
was a lie?

47:19.254 --> 47:22.298
- Basically, yes.
- You're dad's awesome!

47:28.346 --> 47:29.389
What are you doing?

47:31.307 --> 47:32.433
They could be tracing it.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.227
What if an agent wants to help us?

47:34.394 --> 47:36.604
Exactly.
Who went after Jason Bourne?

47:37.438 --> 47:39.274
- Agents.
- And in "Mission Impossible"?

47:40.358 --> 47:43.403
- I haven't seen it.
- She's got no clue.

47:43.570 --> 47:44.696
This always happens:

47:44.904 --> 47:47.240
they brand you a traitor
and set a trap.

47:47.407 --> 47:50.285
We have to prove
your dad's innocence.

47:50.451 --> 47:52.704
We can't prove anything.
They're all dead.

47:52.912 --> 47:56.207
Everyone except your dad.
They'll think he's the killer.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.792
This is textbook stuff.

47:59.252 --> 48:01.546
- Dad.
- Where are we?

48:15.435 --> 48:18.187
If it gets infected
you're going to a hospital.

48:18.354 --> 48:20.106
I know, it's not the first time.

48:21.316 --> 48:24.569
- Can I have a puff?
- I didn't know you smoked.

48:24.736 --> 48:27.447
Because we don't know
each other very well, do we?

48:27.614 --> 48:28.614
No.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.535
How could you deceive him like that?

48:32.994 --> 48:35.788
What else could I do?
I just wanted to protect him.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.499
I don't know how to be a father,

48:38.666 --> 48:42.128
hugs and all that.
Being a secret agent is my game.

48:44.172 --> 48:47.383
If you hadn't been so secret,
Adolfo might not be so boring.

48:47.550 --> 48:50.053
And you wouldn't have
had to dump him.

48:50.219 --> 48:51.596
It's a shame.

48:53.514 --> 48:56.184
You're obviously
a family of whiners.

48:59.437 --> 49:01.522
I'm surrounded by incompetents!

49:01.814 --> 49:03.483
I ask you for one thing,
and you fail!

49:03.650 --> 49:06.319
If you want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

49:06.486 --> 49:09.155
The Allen key. Alright then...

49:09.322 --> 49:11.950
Why didn't you buy it prefabricated?

49:12.116 --> 49:14.285
Really? With what money?

49:14.452 --> 49:16.496
Where's my loot?

49:16.663 --> 49:20.375
Who'd have thought
that one goddamn stamp

49:20.541 --> 49:23.294
would cost 1000 euros?!

49:23.461 --> 49:25.463
Besides, it's not that complicated.

49:25.838 --> 49:28.257
Just follow the simple instructions.

49:28.424 --> 49:30.009
Simple, yeah right!

49:30.176 --> 49:32.971
If only this had been around
30 years ago,

49:33.137 --> 49:35.848
I would've save a fortune
on decorating evil lairs.

49:40.144 --> 49:41.187
Yes?

49:42.981 --> 49:43.981
Good.

49:44.857 --> 49:47.735
They're at his girlfriend's place.
Quick, go get them!

49:49.612 --> 49:52.156
Do we finish, then go get them

49:52.323 --> 49:55.326
or go get them,
then finish the cabinet?

49:55.493 --> 49:57.662
This has a way to go...

50:06.045 --> 50:07.380
Where's my father?

50:07.755 --> 50:11.592
I don't know, when I fell asleep
he was over there, smoking.

50:12.927 --> 50:13.928
Dad!

50:16.764 --> 50:18.766
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

50:18.933 --> 50:21.686
- Dad, how are you?
- Much better.

50:21.853 --> 50:23.354
I got up early this morning

50:23.521 --> 50:27.316
and made breakfast
to make up for the bother.

50:27.483 --> 50:29.527
- It's delicious.
- Have some juice.

50:29.694 --> 50:32.405
Martin, bottoms up.

50:33.740 --> 50:35.908
Did you tell them what happened?

50:36.117 --> 50:38.369
Yes, how awful!
Before, they just mugged you,

50:38.536 --> 50:41.080
now they use razors,
and on an old man...

50:41.247 --> 50:44.375
The world's become
a very dangerous place.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.378
- Good, that's it.
- That's what?

50:47.545 --> 50:50.381
The sodium pentothal I put
in your drinks must be working.

50:50.548 --> 50:53.176
- You poisoned us?
- No, just drugged.

50:53.342 --> 50:55.386
You gave us truth serum.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.430
What about our talk last night?

50:57.597 --> 50:58.931
Very nice, Katia,

50:59.140 --> 51:02.185
but not enough to trust you.
Now I can.

51:02.351 --> 51:04.071
Dad, they're friends.
You're out of control.

51:04.187 --> 51:05.271
Well, well...

51:10.318 --> 51:12.487
What? I don't get it.

51:12.653 --> 51:15.531
Stop drinking it!
It's got truth serum in it!

51:15.740 --> 51:18.826
Do you or have you belonged
to any association?

51:18.993 --> 51:20.661
I joined the Readers Club,

51:20.828 --> 51:23.790
but only because the girl
who came to sell it

51:23.956 --> 51:25.208
was a looker.

51:26.375 --> 51:27.376
Oh, very nice!

51:30.671 --> 51:34.300
Katia, when you started going out
with my son, did you really like him

51:34.467 --> 51:35.747
or was there an ulterior motive?

51:35.843 --> 51:37.595
That's personal! Don't tell him.

51:40.848 --> 51:43.017
At first it was to stick it
to my brother.

51:43.226 --> 51:44.644
I knew it,
she's the jealous one!

51:44.811 --> 51:46.020
- See, Mom?
- I do.

51:46.229 --> 51:49.440
- Then I began to really like him.
- It's no time for couple therapy.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.193
I've got some questions.
Do you still love me?

51:52.360 --> 51:55.363
Of course I love you, but...

51:55.530 --> 51:57.865
I want to be your girl,
not your mother.

51:58.032 --> 52:00.868
I'd have loved you to come
with me, to travel together,

52:01.035 --> 52:02.829
- do tons of things...
- Sure, sure.

52:02.995 --> 52:05.331
...for you to be a man, like your dad.

52:06.791 --> 52:07.791
Whoah!

52:07.917 --> 52:10.503
Whoah, nothing.
I'll change, I promise.

52:10.670 --> 52:14.006
- There you go again.
- It's true, I took the serum.

52:14.215 --> 52:17.135
- I can't lie. See?
- Your juice has no serum.

52:19.846 --> 52:22.265
You're always a big help. Thanks.

52:22.431 --> 52:25.476
I wasn't going to drug my son,
and it's no time for couple therapy,

52:25.643 --> 52:28.312
we're kind of busy here.
Martin...

52:29.897 --> 52:31.399
Anything to hide?

52:33.025 --> 52:35.903
Well... there is one thing.

52:38.781 --> 52:41.659
Two years ago I ran over
an old lady with my Vespa

52:41.826 --> 52:43.286
and rode off.

52:44.328 --> 52:46.706
It was no big deal
because she was old and...

52:46.873 --> 52:48.791
didn't have long to live,

52:48.958 --> 52:52.545
but not a day goes by that
I don't think she died 'cause of me.

52:52.712 --> 52:54.463
My son...

52:55.089 --> 52:58.593
Don't worry, son.
That lady didn't die then.

52:59.427 --> 53:01.429
- How do you know?
- Because I killed her.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.056
She wanted to report you.

53:04.265 --> 53:07.518
She was going to destroy
our family and I couldn't allow it.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.937
So I went to her house

53:10.104 --> 53:11.898
to talk her out of it.

53:12.064 --> 53:14.525
We argued,
one thing led to another, and...

53:14.692 --> 53:17.069
...she fell out of the window.

53:17.278 --> 53:19.572
- How awful!
- Since then...

53:19.739 --> 53:21.199
I haven't been the same.

53:21.532 --> 53:22.742
Yes, drink up.

53:22.909 --> 53:26.704
Actually, she arrived
at the hospital alive.

53:27.538 --> 53:30.583
When she described her assailant,

53:30.750 --> 53:32.585
I knew it was you and...

53:32.752 --> 53:34.795
I knew what I had to do.

53:34.962 --> 53:38.049
A slightly higher dose
of morphine and...

53:39.383 --> 53:41.552
The male nurse
was accused of negligence,

53:42.720 --> 53:44.305
but I did it for our family.

53:44.597 --> 53:45.597
- Dad.
- My girl.

53:46.390 --> 53:48.434
- Dad.
- And you complain about my secrets.

53:48.601 --> 53:50.603
- I see what you mean.
- And you, Mom?

53:54.857 --> 53:58.069
For two years I've been
passing information to Vázquez.

53:58.277 --> 54:00.029
- What?
- He said if I saw Anacleto,

54:00.238 --> 54:01.572
to tell him.

54:01.739 --> 54:04.575
So I did. They're coming here,
probably about now.

54:04.742 --> 54:05.785
But Mom...

54:05.952 --> 54:07.995
He contacted me from prison
and the pay's great.

54:08.162 --> 54:09.997
Really? How is that possible?

54:10.164 --> 54:12.291
It's better than being
second-rate murderers.

54:12.458 --> 54:15.127
It took you three times
to kill the old lady.

54:17.046 --> 54:19.048
- They're here.
- What do we do?

54:29.642 --> 54:32.979
Kick it higher, man!
You're such a klutz!

54:34.647 --> 54:36.274
Just as well!

54:38.401 --> 54:40.403
- Where are they?
- They took the window.

54:40.569 --> 54:42.947
They said to stall you
and say they called the cops

54:43.114 --> 54:45.157
and the building's surrounded,
but it's not true.

54:45.366 --> 54:47.410
They're desperate
and almost out of bullets.

54:47.576 --> 54:50.955
You took so long!
Pour me a little, honey.

54:54.166 --> 54:55.166
Hurry up!

55:00.798 --> 55:02.967
I'll deal with these bums!
Get to the rendezvous!

55:03.634 --> 55:06.053
- Where is it?
- North Station, 2 pm.

55:06.220 --> 55:08.139
You didn't tell me that.
Dad, you're hit!

55:08.347 --> 55:09.765
- And kind of old.
- Go!

55:10.099 --> 55:11.183
Okay, okay!

55:14.186 --> 55:15.229
Damn!

55:21.736 --> 55:23.738
- Damn it!
- Sorry.

55:25.906 --> 55:26.906
Come here.

55:54.101 --> 55:55.102
There!

56:03.861 --> 56:05.988
- Go, Katia.
- What are you going to do?

56:07.031 --> 56:10.493
Finish these guys off...
and get driving lessons.

56:12.161 --> 56:13.161
- Move it.
- Yes.

56:19.835 --> 56:21.504
I'm ready.

56:22.671 --> 56:24.882
Excuse me, those are mine.

56:25.091 --> 56:26.801
- I'll take them all.
- Thanks a lot.

57:32.032 --> 57:33.576
- Everyone at the same time?
- Yeah.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.244
At the same time then.

57:44.503 --> 57:47.006
All this karate bullshit...

57:48.966 --> 57:49.967
Loser!

58:13.949 --> 58:14.949
Martin!

58:16.785 --> 58:18.162
- Where's Adolfo?
- I don't know.

58:18.329 --> 58:19.872
I lost them, they're really fast.

58:20.039 --> 58:23.042
I never win with my sister,
she always beats me!

58:23.209 --> 58:25.002
I hope they've gone to the station.

58:26.295 --> 58:28.088
Oh yeah, the rendezvous.

58:30.090 --> 58:31.884
Well, well, well...

58:33.928 --> 58:36.764
It was rough,
but you got it in the end.

58:38.641 --> 58:40.684
I'm very proud of you, boys.

58:41.310 --> 58:42.770
And now, at last,

58:42.937 --> 58:45.439
the revenge I've planned for 30 years.

58:47.608 --> 58:50.778
- Who the hell are these people?
- I'm the evil Vázquez,

58:50.945 --> 58:52.988
and these are my two henchmen.

58:53.155 --> 58:55.533
I'm hurt that you don't know me.

58:55.699 --> 58:58.536
I know who you are, Vázquez,
and what you've done.

58:58.702 --> 59:01.121
You want to hurt me, then kill me

59:01.288 --> 59:04.750
to get at my dad, your arch-enemy,
but he won't care

59:04.917 --> 59:07.211
because we've had a cold
and distant relationship.

59:07.378 --> 59:10.172
When he wasn't secret-agenting,
he was devoted to sausages.

59:10.339 --> 59:12.841
He ignored me,
but he loved Sapristi,

59:13.008 --> 59:15.261
that stupid dog,
but now you've killed it,

59:15.427 --> 59:17.888
your revenge is complete.

59:18.055 --> 59:21.642
If you want to go home
and take it easy, we'll cope with it.

59:23.602 --> 59:26.897
And you're Anacleto's son.
I expected, I don't know,

59:27.064 --> 59:28.983
more grit, more courage...

59:29.149 --> 59:31.485
That was so pathetic, Adolfo.

59:31.694 --> 59:34.613
I'm almost angry that I planned
all this for such a coward.

59:34.780 --> 59:36.460
It's not cowardice,
I'm just being helpful.

59:39.827 --> 59:41.412
- Where's Anacleto?
- I don't know.

59:41.620 --> 59:44.790
Are you going to make me
yank out your tongue with pliers

59:44.957 --> 59:47.876
- when I'm dressed in white?
- No, Adolfo, don't tell him.

59:48.043 --> 59:50.921
That's easy for you to say,
they're not going to torture you.

59:51.088 --> 59:53.008
You'd sell out your dad
the first chance you get?

59:53.132 --> 59:56.302
No, but let's be frank,
I'll probably crack under torture.

59:56.468 --> 59:58.637
I'm thinking about avoiding
excruciating pain.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:01.849
- It saves us work.
- Unbelievable!

01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:04.935
Anything that's a bit hard,
you don't do it,

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.187
anything that means facing up...

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:08.897
We're getting off track here.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:11.442
One thing is leaving me
because of a driver's license,

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.695
- but enduring torture...
- It's not the license,

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:16.030
it's everything!

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:18.240
- Where's your boyfriend's dad?
- "Ex", she left me yesterday.

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:21.243
- Don't play the victim now.
- He's going to torture me.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.130
You're using torture
to wriggle out of this.

01:00:23.162 --> 01:00:26.206
- I'm not wriggling, I'm tied up!
- Lucky you, eh?

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:27.665
Enough!

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:30.961
- My eye!
- What did you do?!

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.422
What's in my eye?
Adolfo, get it out!

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:34.798
- Christ!
- Get it out!

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.258
Jeez, what a drama queen.

01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:38.385
- You blinded her in one eye!
- Blind?

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.512
Oh, my God!

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:44.224
Now I have your attention,
two things:

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.186
One, I don't go around
hugging people in the street.

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:50.105
That's why they don't call me
the Charming Vázquez,

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:52.775
they call me the Evil Vázquez,

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:54.652
because I'm a real son of a bitch.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.218
- Sure, that makes sense.
- And two:

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:59.114
I obviously want to know
where your father is.

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.533
Tell me
or I'll pull out her other eye.

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:03.911
Yes, he's at the rendezvous.
North Station, 2 pm.

01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:06.789
Good, because I have
a surprise for all of you.

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:13.295
Of course, the rendezvous
is the station.

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:15.506
We keep a low profile, mingle,

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.841
security controls aren't as strict,

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.844
and we access the whole
European rail network. Brilliant.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.597
Yeah, sure. This way.

01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:27.267
The legendary locker
with guns, passports

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.062
and currency from every country.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.856
Actually, it's a change of clothes.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.023
A change of clothes?

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:37.194
We're here so that
you can get changed?

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:39.196
We're here because of
emergency protocol,

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:42.241
but I'm just getting changed
on the way.

01:01:42.408 --> 01:01:44.576
Really? Is there one for me?

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:51.375
It's been ages since
I wore anything so soft.

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:53.502
The more you stretch,
the less you iron.

01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:58.215
A euro. One euro, please.
Just one euro.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.968
Gimeno, relax. He's with us.

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:02.553
Anacleto!

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:05.222
I haven't seen you
since the Cairo mission.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:06.724
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.476
Great characterization,
I'd never guess you were an agent.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:12.563
I've spent years
perfecting the character.

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:16.233
I actually earn more today
than I did at the GP.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:22.531
Boss! I gave you up for dead.

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:25.075
- It was a close shave.
- It was a massacre.

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:28.454
- Who's he?
- A friend of my son.

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:32.082
We were meant to meet here,
but he hasn't showed up.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:35.502
Relax, your son's fine,
I have him in a safe place.

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.671
Gimeno, we have to make enquiries.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.757
- It's not possible that...
- Hold it!

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.803
- Nobody move.
- Anacleto, drop the gun.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:47.556
He's been in cahoots
with Vázquez from the start.

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.975
That's how they knew
the route of the convoy

01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:53.604
and located the farm, Katia's place
and my son's work.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:57.274
Sure, he's the typical traitor,
I said it all along.

01:02:57.983 --> 01:03:00.402
Gimeno, it was Anacleto,
he set Vázquez free.

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:02.988
How else did he escape
from the desert?

01:03:03.197 --> 01:03:05.157
We've been cards partners
all our lives.

01:03:05.324 --> 01:03:08.535
He puts on the same face
when he's bluffing big.

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:11.288
- He's lying.
- Why would I do that?

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:14.208
You saw what happened,
he wiped out the GP.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:17.211
- Vázquez is unpredictable.
- I've lost all my agents!

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.129
You've lost control, Boss.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.257
Don't be stupid,
it's two against one.

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:24.843
- You haven't got a chance.
- How about a deal?

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:27.805
Tell me all you know about Vázquez
and I'll kill him.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.682
What kind of a deal is that?

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:34.937
A fair one.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.355
Shit!

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.317
How did you know I wouldn't...?

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:44.363
I didn't know if you'd pull the trigger,
but I knew it wouldn't fire.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.866
How? Oh, the hug!

01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:51.411
- Son of a...
- Why, Boss?

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:55.165
- After all these years...
- I just wanted to save the GP.

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.919
They wanted to retire us.
The world's overtaken us,

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.337
we're obsolete.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:03.674
We needed a threat
that only we could solve.

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:06.844
With Vázquez on the street,
the GP would be indispensable again.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.389
And you trusted the bad guy.
As a plan it's kind of shit.

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:12.933
- Shit on you!
- Hey, I came to help.

01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:16.436
Where's Vázquez?

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.940
- Where has he got my son?
- I don't know.

01:04:20.107 --> 01:04:23.068
I don't know.
I'd tell you if I knew.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:28.115
He's telling the truth.

01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:29.282
Gimeno, take him away.

01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:31.910
Relax, I'll take care of him.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.247
I screwed up, Anacleto.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:40.669
That's Vázquez's doing?
Get him, like the old days!

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:43.213
Nothing's like the old days now.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.215
Wow!

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:50.345
A Beretta! Like Bruce Willis
in "Die Hard".

01:04:51.263 --> 01:04:52.723
Yipee ky yay, motherfucker!

01:05:26.632 --> 01:05:27.633
- Get back!
- Adolfo!

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:29.384
- Go away! I'll explode!
- Adolfo!

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.261
Dad, they put a bomb on me!

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:33.263
- Hold it, hold it.
- Okay.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.598
- Hold it!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:38.560
Excuse me, are you
Anacleto, Secret Agent?

01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:40.061
Yes.

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:41.438
This is for you.

01:05:45.651 --> 01:05:46.651
- Vázquez.
<i>- Bingo!</i>

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.697
- What have you done to my son?
<i>- Me? Nothing.</i>

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:53.492
<i>You're going to do it.
Yes, that's a bomb.</i>

01:05:53.659 --> 01:05:55.786
<i>Liquid plutonium and Goma-2.</i>

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:57.579
Goddamn son of a bitch!

01:05:57.746 --> 01:06:01.166
<i>If you try to separate them
or deactivate it, it explodes.</i>

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.669
<i>If you try to undo the vest,
it explodes.</i>

01:06:04.086 --> 01:06:05.545
<i>And after one hour, it explodes.</i>

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:09.466
<i>There's only one way to stop it
from wiping out a 500 meter radius.</i>

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.301
- By killing Adolfo.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.178
<i>The device is synchronized
with his heart.</i>

01:06:13.345 --> 01:06:16.139
<i>If it stops, the bomb deactivates.</i>

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.642
<i>A souvenir from my last visit
to the GP.</i>

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:20.519
Relax, it'll all be fine.

01:06:20.686 --> 01:06:23.146
<i>I'd love to stay
to see you pull the trigger.</i>

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:26.441
<i>Unfortunately, I'm almost
at the airport. You decide:</i>

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:30.278
<i>come for me or spend
your last moments with your son.</i>

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:33.323
<i>In any case,
always remember me.</i>

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.282
Vázquez...

01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:35.450
Vázquez!

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.631
I'm sorry, this was beyond me.

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:53.135
It's my fault your one-eyed.
They'll put a patch on you,

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:55.901
kids will call you "pirate",
they'll cancel your driver's license.

01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:58.724
Adolfo, shut up.
Never mind all that now.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:06:59.933
We're going to explode.

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:04.354
I'm sorry, it's impossible.
I've never seen anything like it.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:07.065
- The only way it won't explode...
- I know.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.443
- Will these walls contain an explosion?
- We've evacuated the area.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.737
Everybody out.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.574
- Where are you going?
- She's my sister!

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:17.951
He's my best friend!
I should be there!

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.536
You can't give up.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.972
Don't take it out,
save it for later.

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:41.683
You're going to shoot me, huh?

01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:46.646
Maybe it's better,
at least it'll save Katia.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:49.191
You can get your flight to India.
Damn it!

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:51.526
I'm 30, I haven't had time
to do anything.

01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:54.863
All day on the sofa,
no trips, no wild stuff...

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:57.282
- Now you think of that?
- Travel is overrated.

01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:59.743
Well, you were never home.

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:02.412
All your life out saving the world,
you forgot about me.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.916
Since I'm going to die,
I'll get it off my chest:

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:09.294
Secret agents don't have kids.
James Bond didn't,

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:12.881
or Jason Bourne. There must be
a reason, didn't you think of that?

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:15.509
- Actually, no.
- You should've.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:19.095
It just happened,
we didn't plan anything.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:23.265
Then, suddenly, there you were,
fiddling with my bow tie.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:27.187
Very touching, Dad.
But in the last two days

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:29.314
I've been beaten, shot,

01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:31.942
my girl had an eye plucked out
and she'll lose her license.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.194
Now I have a bomb on my heart.

01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:37.197
Bloody great!
Forgive me if I'm not moved.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.448
Maybe you secret agents
are super-brave

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.368
and don't fear anything.

01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:43.370
Right now I'm crapping myself.

01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:46.206
I know what fear is,
only too well.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:49.542
As an agent I've done things
that would scare anyone.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:51.377
- And you know what?
- What?

01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:53.505
Do you know the day
I was most afraid?

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:54.756
Go on...

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:58.676
Not when I was shot in the gut
or when your mother died.

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.721
It was when you ate those peanuts.

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:05.142
I remember it
as if it were yesterday.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:08.185
You'd turned four
and your teeth were separated,

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:12.941
You blew up like a balloon,
you couldn't breathe.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.943
I didn't know you were allergic.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:17.863
That fear...

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:22.783
...that you wouldn't make it
to the hospital alive was the worst,

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:25.661
until today.

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:31.376
Damn, that was beautiful.

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:37.674
- What's wrong?
- You're leaving already?

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.678
I don't want you to blow up,
but stay a bit longer, eh?

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.015
I'll be right back. Relax.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.229
- Where's he going?
- Help!

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:53.564
I need help!

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.613
Where were you?
There are 4 minutes left!

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:03.700
We give you a cardiac arrest
so the bomb deactivates.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:06.286
Eat the peanuts,
the allergy will do the rest.

01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:08.455
When they take off the bomb,
I'll inject the antihistamine.

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:10.582
- It makes sense, right, Katia?
- Yes.

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:12.834
I don't know,
it's not my speciality.

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:15.545
You forgot the part where
my heart stops and I die.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.547
I'll give you a heart massage.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:20.258
Katia, you're a doctor!
Don't I need a defibrillator?

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:23.345
Yes... I don't know...
Do we have another option?

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:25.722
You'll have to trust me.

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:30.393
What the hell!

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:38.693
Dad, if I die... If I die...

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.528
Relax.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.287
- What?
- Christ!

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:51.247
What's wrong?

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:54.918
Maybe you shouldn't have
eaten the whole bag.

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:57.337
It's too late.

01:10:57.504 --> 01:10:59.756
Don't piss me about now!

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.718
- Sorry.
- Damn it.

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:08.723
Christ, don't let them bury me
with this ugly mug!

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:11.643
- You won't die.
- I don't care.

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:13.812
Cremate me,
that's my last wish.

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:15.772
Adolfo.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.950
That's it, it's stopped.

01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:28.117
Katia, go!

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:31.621
I'm not going.
I'm staying to help.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.373
Now comes the hard part.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800
Mouth.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.971
Come on, son.
Don't do this to me.

01:11:49.431 --> 01:11:50.431
Mouth!

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:54.519
Breathe, damn it!

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.149
C'mon, c'mon!

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.569
Breathe!

01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:06.573
- Adolfo!
- Come on!

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.116
Dad, that's it!

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:11.578
Adolfo, my son...

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:13.330
I think you broke a rib.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:18.585
You're not getting out
of driving school.

01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:21.755
Putting him down again?
He was about to die.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:23.923
What kind of insensitive bitch
acts like that?

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.718
This isn't over.
Vázquez is still on the loose.

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:30.889
He may be evil,
but I don't get it.

01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:33.099
He sets all this up
and doesn't watch the end?

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:36.603
Did you want him to stick around
and watch it with us?

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:05.715
He's still in the building.
I'll get him.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:08.176
Wait. Where are you going?

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:09.594
I can't let him go alone.

01:13:10.637 --> 01:13:11.888
He's hurt, and old.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.599
He's my dad, he needs me.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:19.687
Be very careful. Please.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.277
What, no hug for me?

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:42.544
- Dad, it's me!
- What are you doing here?

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:45.630
I thought I'd come down
and steal a car.

01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:48.133
What else?
You're hurt, I came to help.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.593
Damn!

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.720
I'm ready.

01:13:55.557 --> 01:13:56.683
Then let's go.

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.102
I'm ready.

01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:17.847
Don't dwell on it.

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:20.600
The little guy was a son of a bitch.

01:15:20.767 --> 01:15:21.935
Look out.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:24.020
The Butcher is back.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.463
- Okay, now what?
- I don't know.

01:15:50.672 --> 01:15:54.092
Unless we get away,
the Butcher will gun us down.

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:56.886
We need a getaway car.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.889
The keys are over there.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:01.891
No.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.434
Got a better idea?

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.314
No, I'll go.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:11.067
I won't let anything else
happen to you. Cover me.

01:17:49.457 --> 01:17:50.667
This one?

01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:55.004
- Get in.
- You can't drive like that.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.131
You can't drive.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:59.676
- Let me.
- No. No.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:00.968
No!

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.055
Now show me.

01:18:16.818 --> 01:18:19.529
Step on the left pedal,
put it in first and lift it slowly.

01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:24.450
- I'm suddenly not so sure.
- You've done amazing things.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:27.370
You've fought men, shot guns,
jumped off a building,

01:18:27.537 --> 01:18:30.331
survived a bomb,
put up with me all your life...

01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:33.543
You're ready for this.
Hit the clutch and put it in first.

01:18:37.714 --> 01:18:39.924
Where are you going?
The other way!

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:45.972
What do I do?

01:18:46.139 --> 01:18:48.433
Reverse! Punch it!
Go straight at him!

01:19:07.452 --> 01:19:09.829
Not bad for a first lesson.

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:12.123
Next time we'll do angled parking.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.253
Shit.

01:19:20.006 --> 01:19:21.549
It's Vázquez! Get out!

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:22.318
Looks bad, doesn't it?

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:27.240
Well... But don't worry,
you'll make it, okay?

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:30.034
I want to tell everyone
my dad's a secret agent.

01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:33.538
I wouldn't be secret then.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:36.749
Okay, I won't say anything.

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.378
I'm sorry...

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:43.214
for all the lies.

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:46.008
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:49.136
I just wanted to protect you
from all this.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.890
That's why I pretended
to be a sausage maker.

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:55.935
Well, I always liked the sausages.

01:20:56.102 --> 01:20:57.395
Especially the cured pork.

01:20:57.728 --> 01:21:00.064
Your mother's were better.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.860
I would've liked to know
about Mom before too.

01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:08.406
When she died,
I couldn't handle it.

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:13.703
That's why I was hard on you,

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:17.790
insulting you, laughing at you...

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.168
...to make you stronger.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:23.754
I didn't pick up on that.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.383
And look at you now.

01:21:30.928 --> 01:21:33.389
I don't want to die now.

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:35.433
Gee, Dad...

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.603
I'm so proud of you.

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:43.399
I'm sorry...

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:48.404
if I ever failed you.

01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:22.271
Anacleto never fails.

01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.322
Die, you son of a bitch.

01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:23.541
The old trail of blood trick.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:27.670
- Your dad would be ashamed.
- Don't you talk about him.

01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:29.755
Don't you dare talk about him!

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:32.133
He was a worthy opponent
and you're a joke.

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.510
Children are a disappointment,

01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:36.220
that's why I never had any.

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:39.223
Nor will you.

01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:46.772
Son of a...!

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.651
Bye-bye, Vázquez.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:48.334
"You're no longer with us,
dear friend,

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:50.753
but we'll always remember
those little things

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.546
you liked to do:

01:24:52.713 --> 01:24:55.925
go to the train station,
put on clean shirts,

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:58.594
cards, put drugs in our juice..."

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.513
Martin, you only knew him
for one day.

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:03.015
Okay, but he never deceived me.

01:25:03.224 --> 01:25:04.809
He was always straight up.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.942
Dad, rest in peace here, at last.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:16.195
In secret, just the way you lived.

01:25:16.362 --> 01:25:18.447
Gee, what a guy!

01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:26.038
Katia, we have to talk.

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:28.916
Whenever you want.

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:31.418
- Right now, in the car.
- Sure.

01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:37.675
Can you give me a lift?

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.387
All this has opened my eyes,
I have to make the leap.

01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:44.348
You know what I did today?
You'll freak.

01:25:44.515 --> 01:25:46.809
I signed up for driving lessons.

01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:49.478
And I'm coming to India with you.
Or wherever.

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:51.647
You want to travel? Let's travel.

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:53.858
Or do skydiving? We'll do it.

01:25:54.024 --> 01:25:56.152
We'll have adventures!
I'm a new man!

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:59.572
- I don't recognize myself.
- Adolfo, sorry, but...

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:02.575
I realize I was totally wrong.

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:06.078
- About what?
- Everything.

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:09.498
All this fighting...

01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:13.836
I got kidnapped, tied to a bomb,
my eye's screwed...

01:26:14.003 --> 01:26:15.004
And I'm still...

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:18.424
getting my head around
my mother being a snitch.

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:21.844
I've realized that
I'm not happy here.

01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:24.096
What I need is

01:26:24.305 --> 01:26:26.515
peace and quiet and rest.

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:32.271
Okay. So we're not going to India?
You were looking forward to it.

01:26:32.438 --> 01:26:34.190
Not now, and I feel terrible.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.901
I postponed it,
I need some time at home.

01:26:39.028 --> 01:26:40.696
Okay. What about us?

01:26:40.988 --> 01:26:42.698
There is no "us", Adolfo.

01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:46.493
Now I need a normal boyfriend,
no nasty surprises.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.246
Just quiet dinners
on Saturday on the sofa,

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:51.790
a blanket, a DVD and...

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:56.045
I see that now
it's impossible with you.

01:26:57.087 --> 01:26:58.087
I'm sorry.

01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:03.302
I hope you're finally convinced
that she's a bitch.

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:16.482
Right, now what do we do?

01:27:28.327 --> 01:27:30.079
The objective is 100 yards away.

01:27:38.504 --> 01:27:40.506
15 armed men
protecting the Emir.

01:27:40.673 --> 01:27:43.300
Hold your position,
helicopter in 20 minutes.

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:48.305
Start the party.

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:57.815
<i>I repeat, hold your position.
Back-up arrives in 20 minutes.</i>

01:27:58.524 --> 01:28:00.734
Confirm message received.

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:05.281
<i>Confirm, please.
Can you hear me?</i>

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:07.031
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:28:08.492 --> 01:28:11.161
I'm not receiving confirmation.

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:16.583
- Code name?
- Anacleto.

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:17.750
Anacleto?

01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:21.297
I've got a deal for you.

01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:30.556
ANACLETO, SECRET AGENT

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.559
Guys, I don't think
he can hear me.

01:28:33.726 --> 01:28:35.686
He's not receiving my indications.

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:39.315
Please, stop what you're doing
and come fix this.

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:42.234
There's no Net, no signal.
It's saturated.

01:28:42.443 --> 01:28:45.571
Can you stop downloading
all that crap, please?

01:28:45.779 --> 01:28:48.115
Do it at home!
Don't you have Wifi?

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:50.200
The life of a hero is at stake!

01:28:50.409 --> 01:28:53.912
He's in the goddamn Middle East!
He could die!

01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:55.205
There are jackals there!

01:28:55.414 --> 01:28:56.414
Hey, buddy, buddy...

01:28:57.305 --> 01:29:03.580
