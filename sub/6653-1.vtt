02:30.380 --> 02:32.460
Tommy.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.700
Come on, boy.

02:47.140 --> 02:48.620
Come and get it.

03:36.580 --> 03:38.980
Hey! There he is.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.460
Turn it down, you fuck!

03:41.580 --> 03:43.780
He'll hear us.

03:43.860 --> 03:49.700
Come on. Let’s finish
this thing once and for all.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.180
Yeah!

03:55.700 --> 03:56.660
Go!

03:56.780 --> 03:58.420
All right, man!

04:01.940 --> 04:04.940
We’re coming to get you, Tommy.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.580
Run! Run!

04:18.100 --> 04:21.260
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

04:29.380 --> 04:32.100
We’re gonna send you
back to hell, freak!

04:36.540 --> 04:38.020
We got him!

04:41.140 --> 04:42.500
Batter up!

04:43.500 --> 04:44.780
That’s a single!

04:47.420 --> 04:48.740
That’s a double!

04:48.820 --> 04:50.860
That’s a triple, man!
Come on! Come on!

04:52.740 --> 04:55.220
Home run!

04:55.300 --> 04:57.420
String him up! String him up!

04:57.500 --> 04:59.020
Come here!

05:00.300 --> 05:02.300
All right. String him up.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.140
All right. Let him go.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.220
Oh, boy, you are a swinger!

05:07.340 --> 05:09.020
You are! Come here!

05:10.060 --> 05:11.460
Come here.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.620
Oh, boys, we caught
ourselves a big one!

05:13.740 --> 05:15.780
Hoist him up! Come on, higher!

05:15.900 --> 05:17.140
Higher!

05:17.220 --> 05:19.060
Well, well, well, boy!

05:19.180 --> 05:21.780
Looks like we got ourselves
a big one, didn’t we?

05:23.020 --> 05:26.060
And he’s pretty too, isn’t he?

05:26.180 --> 05:27.940
Isn’t he?

05:31.820 --> 05:33.340
He’s beautiful!

05:33.460 --> 05:34.900
All right!

05:42.180 --> 05:46.540
Okay, boys, time to
send this freak...

05:46.620 --> 05:48.340
back to hell!

05:49.220 --> 05:51.180
Do it! Do it!

05:53.020 --> 05:54.860
Drop him!

06:09.980 --> 06:11.900
Dirty job, -

06:11.980 --> 06:13.820
but someone had to do it.

06:22.700 --> 06:26.180
You know, all I ever wanted
to do when I was growing up

06:26.300 --> 06:28.060
was to get away from this town.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.900
If you told me 20 years ago
that I’d give up the fifth precinct -

06:31.020 --> 06:34.180
in New York City for the old
Ferren Woods sheriffs office...

06:34.260 --> 06:36.580
- How’s that uniform fit?
- Like a glove.

06:36.860 --> 06:39.260
And as for this, I’m
damned happy to say, -

06:39.380 --> 06:41.660
that with the exception
of some target practice, -

06:41.780 --> 06:43.780
I won’t be using it much.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.300
There.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.900
Now, how about that, huh?

06:46.980 --> 06:48.940
Oh, Sheriff.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.980
Listen! You hear it?

06:52.100 --> 06:53.140
What?

06:53.260 --> 06:55.900
Silence.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.780
Beautiful, peaceful silence.

06:58.860 --> 07:02.540
There’s no traffic, no
pollution, no gangs.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.860
Yeah. You’re right.

07:04.980 --> 07:06.380
But...

07:06.460 --> 07:08.540
What?

07:09.980 --> 07:12.940
I’m just not sure we made
the right decision moving here.

07:13.060 --> 07:15.660
Jenny’s fine, Beth.

07:15.780 --> 07:18.860
Yeah, what about you?

07:18.980 --> 07:21.020
All that’s behind us now, huh?

07:21.140 --> 07:22.820
This is our new home.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.460
This is where we make
our life together.

07:25.580 --> 07:29.060
You know, I don’t think our
daughter quite sees it that way.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.740
Could you please just talk to her?

07:30.820 --> 07:34.580
Our daughter and I don’t talk.
We debate, remember?

07:35.620 --> 07:37.540
Jenny will be okay.

07:39.180 --> 07:41.380
Just keep an eye on her.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.780
Make sure she stays
clear of the trouble, -

07:43.860 --> 07:46.660
she ran into in the city, that’s all.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.100
Hey, man. Let’s spark that joint.

07:55.180 --> 07:56.900
Light my fire.

08:07.300 --> 08:11.940
Hey! You guys knock it off back there.
You’re gonna stink up the upholstery.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.740
Hey.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.580
Isn’t that the new girl?

08:21.140 --> 08:22.860
Yeah, she’s kinda cute.

08:22.940 --> 08:26.900
It’s Jenny Braddock.
Her dad’s the new sheriff.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.780
Big fucking deal.

08:30.180 --> 08:32.140
Hey, Jenny. It’s Marcie.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.659
Remember me from trade class?

08:33.780 --> 08:36.179
Yeah. Hi, Marcie.

08:36.260 --> 08:39.900
Jenny Braddock, I’m Danny.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.780
Danny Dixon.

08:43.460 --> 08:44.980
Let me guess.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.420
You guys are the local
badasses, right?

08:48.500 --> 08:49.980
That’s right.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.540
Well, no offense, but
I’ve seen a lot badder.

08:58.020 --> 09:00.300
New York City girl.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.980
I like your style, Braddock.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.660
I really truly do.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.180
My name’s Jenny.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.060
My father’s name’s Braddock.

09:12.180 --> 09:14.300
Okay, Jenny.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.380
Can I offer you a ride?

09:16.460 --> 09:20.260
I don’t know if you’ve noticed,
but the school’s right over there.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.300
Who says we’re going to school?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.540
Yeah, okay. I'll ride with you guys.

09:29.660 --> 09:31.260
All right, let’s do it.

09:31.340 --> 09:34.220
Come on. You’re my new girl.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.500
- I’m Peter.
- Hi.

09:39.900 --> 09:43.020
- Let’s roll.
- Yeah, yeah, hell, yeah.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.500
You got my hunting license ready?

09:58.620 --> 10:00.620
Yeah. Right here.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.260
It’s ten dollars, please.

10:05.340 --> 10:08.660
Don’t seem fair, the price
of hunting going up this year.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.260
Sheriff Longbow never raised prices.

10:11.340 --> 10:14.940
Costs go up, Slick. Sheriff Braddock’s
got nothing to do with that.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.740
I liked it better before.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.500
And don’t call me Slick.

10:18.620 --> 10:22.020
I didn’t like it in high school
and I still don’t like it.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.700
Name’s Ernst.

10:27.140 --> 10:30.260
Would you believe old Slick and I -

10:30.380 --> 10:32.100
we’re the same age.

10:32.220 --> 10:34.940
Used to be best friends
when we were kids.

10:36.060 --> 10:38.180
What a loser.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.500
Looks like this is gonna be a
good hunting season, Sheriff.

10:40.580 --> 10:44.100
I wish I could take
credit for that, Judge.

10:44.180 --> 10:46.660
You know, I had a feeling
a local fellow like you -

10:46.780 --> 10:49.220
was gonna be the
right man for this job.

10:50.620 --> 10:54.260
You just seem like a man that...

10:54.380 --> 10:57.380
wants to make things work.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.220
See you, Sheriff.

10:59.340 --> 11:00.780
Yeah.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.180
Oh, by the way, your physical’s
scheduled for noon.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.340
Okay, here we go.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.620
Now...

11:11.740 --> 11:13.340
don’t worry, Sheriff.

11:13.460 --> 11:16.700
Dr. Pettibone comes
from a long line of doctors.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.300
Except most of them
studied their medicine -

11:22.380 --> 11:25.100
with roots and blackbird
beaks in swamps.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.380
Blackbird beaks, eh?

11:27.460 --> 11:29.180
- This is cold.
- Okay.

11:29.300 --> 11:34.020
My grandma be the top sorcière in the
whole of the Achala Falaya. Breathe.

11:34.140 --> 11:35.420
What’s a sorcière?

11:35.540 --> 11:36.540
Witch doctor.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.060
Those are some of her
patients who didn’t pay.

11:43.340 --> 11:45.420
Knock, knock.

11:45.500 --> 11:49.140
Sheriff, Delilah, the mayor’s
ready anytime you are.

11:49.260 --> 11:50.460
Send him in.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.580
Right this way.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.620
Sheriff.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.060
- Mayor.
- Ma’am.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.220
- Hello, Mayor.
- Well, it’s good to see you.

12:01.340 --> 12:05.700
Well, now, I ain’t got time for
greetings. Marie, you got my guitar?

12:05.820 --> 12:09.260
Sure do. Here you go, Mayor.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.780
Did you cure it?

12:10.860 --> 12:12.340
Well, it’s tuned.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.220
Thank you kindly, darling.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.620
Well, I gotta bail.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.980
Playing a little gig tonight
and I’m running late.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.980
By the way, how’s everybody
treating you?

12:21.100 --> 12:23.300
Just fine.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.420
Still the same little
town I remember.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.620
Be careful, Sheriff.

12:27.740 --> 12:30.380
It ain’t New York,
but it ain’t that little.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.420
If I were you, I’d watch
where you’re going.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.900
Same with that pretty
little girl of yours.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.180
I’d hate to see her wind
up with the wrong crowd.

12:38.260 --> 12:40.100
Afternoon, Delilah.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.860
Good afternoon, Mayor.

12:55.660 --> 12:57.700
So what is this place anyway?

12:57.780 --> 13:01.300
It’s an old iron mine.
They say it’s bottomless.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.460
Some miners disappeared
down there in the 50s.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.020
They never found the bodies.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.740
Some say they fell straight to hell.

13:09.820 --> 13:13.220
You can still hear them
screaming on a full moon.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.100
Don’t listen to her. She’s a sucker
for all that supernatural bullshit.

13:17.300 --> 13:20.540
- Hand me the hook.
- Here you go, Danny boy.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.460
Hey, city girl.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.340
I swing across, you give me a kiss?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.340
No way.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.060
I just may fall.

13:34.260 --> 13:36.460
How about if I close my eyes?

13:37.420 --> 13:38.540
Do it, man.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.340
So where’s that kiss?

13:48.580 --> 13:51.060
Hey! Somebody coming.

13:55.860 --> 13:57.900
Shit, it’s my dad.

14:03.780 --> 14:06.860
So I guess school let
out early today, huh?

14:06.980 --> 14:08.780
Daniel Dixon, sir.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.380
Welcome to Ferren Woods.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.900
Judge Dixon’s boy?

14:11.980 --> 14:12.940
Yes, sir.

14:14.740 --> 14:16.900
Well, then you should
know more than anybody, -

14:17.020 --> 14:19.980
that these "No Trespassing"
signs up here have a purpose.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.580
Absolutely, sir.

14:23.140 --> 14:25.380
Well, let’s say we pack up our gear -

14:25.500 --> 14:28.020
and get our little asses
out of here, huh?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.180
That sound like a plan?

14:30.300 --> 14:32.180
Yeah.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.100
Come on, Jenny. I'll drive you home.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.100
Dad!

14:35.220 --> 14:36.900
No. He’s right, Jen.

14:40.460 --> 14:43.180
Bye, Jenny.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.300
Hey, shut up!

14:52.780 --> 14:55.220
It was nice to meet you all.

14:57.740 --> 15:00.060
No. The pleasure’s all mine.

15:09.820 --> 15:13.660
First you tell me to make friends and then you
tell me you don’t like the friends I make?

15:13.780 --> 15:16.380
I give up.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.660
Those kids are trouble, Jen.

15:18.780 --> 15:21.980
You’re a bright girl.
You can see that, can’t you?

15:22.060 --> 15:24.220
Yeah, I can see a lot of things.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.700
And what’s that supposed to mean?

15:28.660 --> 15:30.620
Nothing. Just forget it.

15:31.740 --> 15:33.500
Can’t we do better than this?

15:35.620 --> 15:37.500
Your mother’s very concerned.

15:37.620 --> 15:40.700
Are you gonna break her
heart like you did back east?

15:40.820 --> 15:43.300
That’s me. Little old heartbreaker.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.980
I want you to promise me that you’re not
gonna hang out with those kids anymore.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.020
Jenny, you hear me?

15:55.620 --> 15:57.460
Yes, sir.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.500
So what'd you tell your dad?

16:38.620 --> 16:40.500
I didn’t.

16:40.620 --> 16:43.140
You told your mother?

16:43.260 --> 16:44.700
- Hey, Danny boy.
- Yeah?

16:44.780 --> 16:46.780
Let’s show the new
girl some real fun.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.420
- All right, cow tipping!
- Shut up!

16:49.540 --> 16:53.260
- Here we go. You want to check
it out, Pete? - Go for it!

17:00.460 --> 17:03.180
- Go for it again.
- Here we go!

17:06.180 --> 17:09.060
Knock it off!
Turn the lights back on!

17:09.180 --> 17:10.300
Here we go.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.220
Oh, shit!

17:22.140 --> 17:23.980
Shit!

17:27.380 --> 17:28.740
Let’s get out of the car!

17:28.820 --> 17:30.380
- Where is she?
- You hit her, man!

17:30.500 --> 17:32.260
She came out of fucking nowhere!

17:33.940 --> 17:36.820
- I saw her fall right here.
- Where the fuck is she?

17:36.900 --> 17:38.380
Does anybody know who she is?

17:38.500 --> 17:39.460
She’s nobody.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.420
Look, she’s just some crazy lady, -

17:41.500 --> 17:43.780
that lives in Ferren
Hollow, all right?

17:43.860 --> 17:47.020
Some folks say she’s a witch.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.660
Jesus! Look at my fucking car!

17:52.060 --> 17:55.060
This doesn’t make any sense.
Where the hell did she go?

17:55.180 --> 17:57.140
Who cares? She walked
away, she’s fine.

17:57.220 --> 17:59.100
Wait a second.
We don’t know that, man.

17:59.180 --> 18:01.340
- Does anybody know where she lives?
- Look, Jen...

18:01.420 --> 18:03.780
No, you look!
A hit-and-run is serious shit.

18:03.860 --> 18:06.140
Now, where does she live, Danny?

18:06.220 --> 18:07.700
I know.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.940
All right! All right!

18:11.020 --> 18:12.700
- Come on.
- Come on!

18:19.660 --> 18:21.300
Check it out.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.100
Shit. What the fuck is this?
Pet Cemetery?

18:25.220 --> 18:27.820
- Ow!
- Be careful.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.260
God, it looks like
something’s buried out here.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.540
- This is a lot of fun.
- The cabin’s this way.

18:32.660 --> 18:35.260
- Let’s go!
- Guys? Guys?

18:39.580 --> 18:41.780
I haven’t been here
since I was a kid.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.860
- Just be careful.
- Yeah, watch it.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.420
Damn.

18:47.540 --> 18:50.860
This place looks like a garbage dump.

18:50.940 --> 18:52.700
It’s a cabin, stupid!

18:52.820 --> 18:54.300
Come on up.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.580
Guys, this is kinda weird.
Can we go home?

19:00.700 --> 19:02.700
- Would you shut up, Paulie?
- Hello?

19:02.820 --> 19:05.100
Hello?

19:10.020 --> 19:12.020
Miss Osie?

19:14.740 --> 19:16.700
Hey, witchie, you got visitors.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.540
Look at all this stuff.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.500
Guys, let’s go.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.260
She’s not here so we can leave.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.980
It’s still warm.

19:30.100 --> 19:33.420
Sure. In case she needs it
to cook up her sacrifices.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.260
Young girls burn best.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.780
You guys, cut it out.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.700
This shit's gross.

19:42.460 --> 19:45.540
Hey, guys, check it out.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.940
What is it?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.020
I don’t know.

19:50.140 --> 19:53.820
Ask Marcie. She knows
all about this witch shit.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.460
Don’t ask me.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.740
This stuff is way
beyond Ouija boards.

19:59.660 --> 20:03.780
Doesn’t this look like
that grave I tripped over?

20:03.900 --> 20:05.900
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

20:06.020 --> 20:08.500
This looks like a page
from the Book of Shadows.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.580
What?

20:11.140 --> 20:13.460
It’s like a spell book.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.300
Let me see that.

20:16.060 --> 20:17.460
Wait.

20:17.580 --> 20:20.740
Guys, this is a spell
to bring back the dead.

20:26.780 --> 20:28.940
Is that blood?

20:31.660 --> 20:33.940
Supposedly blood of the damned.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.340
That’s disgusting.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.260
This is great.

20:38.340 --> 20:40.740
We’ve got a spell to
bring back the dead.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.940
- We got some cursed blood.
- What are you talking about?

20:44.060 --> 20:47.100
What I’m talking about
is some real danger, man.

20:47.220 --> 20:49.340
Some real excitement.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.820
Whatever that old witch
has got buried out there, -

20:51.940 --> 20:54.180
she wants to bring back to life.

20:54.260 --> 20:55.660
Let’s help her out.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.140
Yeah, Paulie.

20:58.220 --> 21:01.420
You guys, this is serious shit.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.700
Danny, I wouldn’t fuck
with it if I were you.

21:03.820 --> 21:05.780
Neither would I. Let’s go.

21:05.860 --> 21:08.140
What do you think, Jenny? You game?

21:08.260 --> 21:11.100
Look, we came here to
check on the old woman.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.140
A little danger never
hurt anyone, right?

21:17.100 --> 21:20.540
Look, we knocked when
we first came in.

21:22.260 --> 21:24.900
Leave here.

21:24.980 --> 21:26.980
Now.

21:36.260 --> 21:37.700
I think she’s blind.

21:37.820 --> 21:41.980
These eyes can see more
than you know, boy.

21:43.300 --> 21:48.020
We were just worried
that you might be hurt.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.700
You know, the accident.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.340
We didn’t see you.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.860
We’re really sorry.

21:58.020 --> 21:59.980
Let’s go. Come on.

22:05.100 --> 22:06.860
Leave it here.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.660
It’s very dangerous, boy.

22:09.780 --> 22:11.020
Don’t walk with it.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.900
What?

22:13.020 --> 22:18.420
You don’t know the evil
you are conjuring, boy.

22:21.060 --> 22:22.540
Give it to me!

22:22.660 --> 22:24.060
Give it to me!

22:29.980 --> 22:32.380
- Let’s get out of here.
- Come on! Let’s go!

22:32.500 --> 22:34.340
Come on, guys!

22:34.420 --> 22:39.020
You... will... die.

22:39.140 --> 22:44.220
You... all... will... die.

22:44.340 --> 22:49.340
Miss Osie curses every one of you -

22:50.700 --> 22:56.100
to the vengeance of Pumpkinhead.

22:56.340 --> 22:57.820
- Come on.
- Damn.

22:57.940 --> 23:00.500
- This is getting out of hand.
- Can we just go home?

23:00.580 --> 23:03.220
- Let’s go home.
- You’re the one who wanted to stay.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.580
Don’t be a wimp, Paulie. Here it is.

23:08.260 --> 23:10.180
Let’s do this.

23:10.260 --> 23:12.260
Danny, are you sure?

23:13.620 --> 23:15.580
There’s no turning back, now.

23:37.740 --> 23:39.580
Pay dirt.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.620
Hey, help me down.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.300
Come on.

23:51.340 --> 23:53.460
Okay.

23:53.580 --> 23:55.180
Take this right here.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.180
Here we go, man.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.980
What the fuck is that?

24:22.100 --> 24:24.540
It smells.

24:24.660 --> 24:27.900
Oh, Danny, this is really sick.

24:28.020 --> 24:29.420
Pour the blood, Marcie.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.740
- I’m pouring the blood.
- I'll read the words.

24:37.220 --> 24:40.260
"Death by anger -

24:40.380 --> 24:41.900
seared with pain."

24:42.020 --> 24:44.380
Look, I don’t need thrills
this badly, guys.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.980
I’m out of here.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.860
"Soul who wanders -

24:48.980 --> 24:51.380
what is thy name?"

24:53.980 --> 24:59.340
"Entreat thy lord from far below.

24:59.460 --> 25:02.180
Breathe life anew..."

25:06.780 --> 25:08.500
"... into thy soul."

25:10.420 --> 25:11.820
Shut up!

25:26.220 --> 25:29.180
Oh! Help me!

25:29.260 --> 25:31.380
- Help! Help!
- Guys!

25:35.420 --> 25:37.940
This shit looks like it’s a dud.

25:42.460 --> 25:44.940
Thank God. I’m out of here.

25:45.020 --> 25:47.860
Looks like old witchie
wasn’t a witch after all.

25:50.180 --> 25:52.180
Fire! Guys!

25:52.260 --> 25:54.540
Guys, the old lady’s
house is on fire!

25:54.620 --> 25:56.580
She’s still in there!

26:07.900 --> 26:09.300
- Guys, here!
- Oh, my God.

26:09.420 --> 26:11.540
- How'd this thing start?
- Where’s the old witch?

26:11.660 --> 26:14.100
She probably already got out.
Let’s get out of here.

26:14.180 --> 26:16.260
- No!
- We gotta get out of here!

26:16.340 --> 26:18.500
We gotta go now! Let’s go!

26:18.580 --> 26:20.100
You guys, we can’t go!

26:20.180 --> 26:22.020
Come on! Go!

27:26.780 --> 27:30.580
- Close the road off next
to the mill, okay? - Right.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.700
Sheriff.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.900
Hey, Marie. How’s the old woman?

27:36.020 --> 27:39.980
Doesn’t look good. We’ve got her at the
local clinic and it’s just a matter of time.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.860
Fires like this... accidents happen.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.500
Maybe it wasn’t an accident.

27:47.620 --> 27:49.540
This is an outside windowsill.

27:49.660 --> 27:51.580
These marks are all over the place.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.940
From the looks of them, something
was trying to claw its way in.

27:55.060 --> 27:58.860
I’m just not sure whether it was
trying to help her or to kill her.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.740
- Take it to the lab and
give it to Delilah. - Sure.

28:01.820 --> 28:03.300
- Thanks, Marie.
- You got it.

28:05.060 --> 28:06.980
Look, I’m sorry, Jenny.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.020
We were just having some fun.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.660
Danny, she’s in the hospital.

28:10.780 --> 28:12.180
You saw that fire.

28:12.260 --> 28:14.260
There’s nothing we could have done.

28:16.180 --> 28:18.660
Let’s just drop it, all right?

28:18.740 --> 28:20.460
- But, Danny...
- But, what?

28:20.540 --> 28:21.860
That old woman...

28:21.980 --> 28:23.380
Hey, look!

28:23.500 --> 28:25.180
Everybody’s gonna
keep their mouth shut.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.420
And nobody’s gonna get wise.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.140
You got it?

28:29.260 --> 28:31.620
Just chill, all right?

28:31.740 --> 28:34.260
- Whatever.
- Shit.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.740
It must have been an accident.

28:42.820 --> 28:45.580
You didn’t say anything
to your old man, did you?

28:45.660 --> 28:47.660
No.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.140
You know I’d never
hurt anyone, don’t you?

29:04.500 --> 29:06.740
What’s with the gun, Ernst?

29:06.820 --> 29:08.700
Free country, ain’t it?

29:10.300 --> 29:13.300
I come here to get my money back
for this here hunting license.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.700
Is there a problem?

29:15.820 --> 29:17.540
Ain’t nothing no law can handle.

29:17.620 --> 29:20.220
Cause now that old
witch is riled up, -

29:20.340 --> 29:22.620
you ain’t gonna get
me in that hollow.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.940
I’m afraid I don’t follow you.

29:25.060 --> 29:28.700
Them damned kids don’t know
what they done messed with.

29:28.820 --> 29:31.180
But when they messed
with old Miss Osie, -

29:31.300 --> 29:33.260
they done messed with Satan hisself.

29:34.660 --> 29:36.060
There were kids up there?

29:36.140 --> 29:39.140
I was out walking in the woods.

29:39.220 --> 29:41.420
I seen this red car... a convertible.

29:41.540 --> 29:44.020
Fast kids rumbling by.

29:45.180 --> 29:47.540
You gonna give me my
money back or not?

29:47.620 --> 29:49.900
Yeah.

29:50.020 --> 29:52.420
I don’t want any
unhappy hunters out there.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.860
I ain’t no hunter no more.

29:56.980 --> 29:58.380
I’m the hunted.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.740
Cause it’s back.

30:00.860 --> 30:04.380
And ain’t none of us safe till
he gets what he come for.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.900
Wait, wait, wait.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.580
Just what are you talking about?

30:12.940 --> 30:16.780
Why don’t you ask the judge or the mayor?

30:16.900 --> 30:19.580
They the smart ones.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.980
I’m just a dumb old farmer, right?

30:34.780 --> 30:36.260
Oh, shit.

30:53.340 --> 30:55.940
Afternoon, Sheriff Braddock.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.580
Nice car.

30:57.700 --> 31:00.820
Thanks. Judge is inside.
You can go ahead on in.

31:00.940 --> 31:04.100
Actually I dropped by to talk to you.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:08.420 --> 31:10.780
You probably heard about
that fire last night?

31:10.900 --> 31:12.620
Yeah.

31:12.700 --> 31:16.260
I sure am sorry to hear about that
old woman. She gonna pull through?

31:16.340 --> 31:18.820
We'll just have to wait and see.

31:20.620 --> 31:25.260
You don’t know anybody who
might have been up there, do you?

31:26.380 --> 31:27.860
I sure don’t, Sheriff.

31:30.780 --> 31:32.220
Some dent.

31:33.780 --> 31:35.180
How'd it happen?

31:35.260 --> 31:37.140
I hit a dog.

31:37.260 --> 31:38.820
Aha.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.380
Big dog.

31:46.580 --> 31:47.980
Problem here, Sean?

31:48.100 --> 31:50.860
- Hey. - I was just telling
Sheriff Braddock here -

31:50.940 --> 31:53.500
how I was home all night studying.

31:56.220 --> 31:57.780
You know, last night.

31:57.900 --> 32:00.260
Yes.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.420
Studying.

32:02.540 --> 32:05.580
Yes, the boy’s quite a student.

32:05.700 --> 32:07.740
I bet he is.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.260
Sharp car, too.

32:09.340 --> 32:11.940
Not another one like
it within 50 miles.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.900
Somehow I figured that.

32:20.380 --> 32:23.820
- Judge.
- Sheriff.

32:23.940 --> 32:27.260
You be sure and tell
Jenny I said hi, Sheriff.

32:31.300 --> 32:33.860
You been up to something
you shouldn’t have?

32:33.980 --> 32:37.260
He’s just pissed off cause
I’m seeing his daughter.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.460
You’re already on probation, boy.

32:43.540 --> 32:45.940
I had a hell of a
time arranging that.

32:46.060 --> 32:48.380
You screw up one more time,
I can’t cover for you!

32:48.500 --> 32:50.300
Hey, don’t worry
about covering for me.

32:50.420 --> 32:53.180
I can take care of myself.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.100
Hey!

33:07.020 --> 33:08.380
Oh, no.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.980
It is happening again.

33:12.060 --> 33:14.180
He is coming.

33:52.420 --> 33:56.060
Oh, Lord God, gimme strength.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.460
The Lord is my shepherd.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.540
I shall fear no evil.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.300
And thy rod -

34:34.380 --> 34:37.820
and this shotgun shall comfort me.

34:41.139 --> 34:44.020
Lord God, save me!

34:44.139 --> 34:45.980
Come on, Satan!

34:53.260 --> 34:54.580
Children...

34:56.659 --> 34:59.420
Sinners, you’re going to discover
the wrath of the beast.

35:07.860 --> 35:11.500
Here comes your God.
He is our savior.

35:11.620 --> 35:14.580
Believe the beast and he
will show you no mercy.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.100
Satan. Satan is not your friend.

35:47.700 --> 35:51.420
Well, Dixon didn’t waste any
time getting over here, did he?

35:54.620 --> 35:56.220
You sure you’re ready for this?

35:56.340 --> 35:59.780
Ten years in the 12th
precinct’s made me too ready.

35:59.900 --> 36:01.580
- Let’s do it.
- Right.

36:03.740 --> 36:06.060
You know, before I came here, -

36:06.180 --> 36:09.340
I worked in the New Orleans
coroner’s office for two years.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.300
They brought in some
real hamburger meat.

36:11.420 --> 36:15.100
But I ain’t ever seen
anything this bad.

36:15.220 --> 36:18.980
Manhattan dumpsters
have got nothing on this.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.180
Well, you ask me, -

36:24.260 --> 36:26.860
another one of them wildcats -

36:26.980 --> 36:30.180
has been scavenging around here.

36:30.300 --> 36:34.420
Old Ernst, he’s been bitching about
them coming down from the hills -

36:34.540 --> 36:36.820
poaching his chickens.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.820
Well, it’s hard to tell
much of anything, -

36:38.900 --> 36:41.700
until I take him back to the lab.

36:41.820 --> 36:43.740
Or what’s left of him.

36:47.700 --> 36:48.660
Dee?

36:48.780 --> 36:51.460
What you got?

36:51.540 --> 36:53.380
Either an unusual blood splatter -

36:53.500 --> 36:57.260
or somethin's been
drawn here on purpose.

36:57.380 --> 37:00.140
Drawn? Well, what is it?

37:06.580 --> 37:09.140
I'll get Cory and the boys
to put a hunting party together -

37:09.260 --> 37:10.660
and we'll track it down.

37:10.740 --> 37:13.220
Now, just hold on there, Judge.

37:13.340 --> 37:16.340
The last thing I need
is a trigger-happy posse, -

37:16.460 --> 37:20.380
who thinks everything
that moves is a wildcat.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.500
Ernst talked about something
coming back for revenge.

37:28.220 --> 37:31.380
Well, I don’t mean to
speak ill of the dead, -

37:33.020 --> 37:37.420
but old Ernst,
he’s just a scared old boy -

37:37.540 --> 37:39.540
with a head full of rats.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.780
H. Christ.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.420
Clean this mess up.

37:44.540 --> 37:47.420
- Goddamn.
- Bye, fellas.

37:47.500 --> 37:50.260
We got a real winner here.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.380
Well, here’s my autopsy report.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.980
- You want some coffee?
- I’m wired enough.

38:02.060 --> 38:04.740
Old Ernst took one hell of a ride.

38:04.860 --> 38:09.180
Severed limbs, lacerated
quads, crushed thorax, -

38:09.300 --> 38:12.580
and, not to mention, 63 broken bones.

38:13.700 --> 38:16.420
And it gets weirder. Look.

38:17.540 --> 38:19.940
Look at these striations.

38:20.060 --> 38:24.100
Identical to the ones on
Miss Osie's windowsill.

38:24.220 --> 38:27.540
So whatever killed Ernst was
also at Miss Osie's place.

38:29.260 --> 38:31.300
- Jen.
- I’m sorry, Mom.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.980
I'll get that. It’s probably for me.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.340
- Hello?
- It’s me. Can you come out?

38:50.460 --> 38:53.500
No. It’s not a good time.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.060
We have to talk, Danny.

38:55.140 --> 38:56.780
You didn’t tell your dad anything?

38:56.900 --> 39:00.460
No, but I think he’s starting
to put things together.

39:00.540 --> 39:02.020
What together?

39:02.140 --> 39:05.540
The old woman, some farmer
who just got killed.

39:05.660 --> 39:08.940
- Something really strange is
happening. - Don’t worry about it.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.460
I talked to my old man -

39:10.580 --> 39:13.060
and I won’t let anything
happen to you, okay, doll?

39:13.180 --> 39:15.660
Jenny, dinner’s ready!

39:15.780 --> 39:18.140
I'll be right there!

39:18.220 --> 39:20.020
Look, I gotta go.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.940
I'll see you after
school tomorrow, okay?

39:22.060 --> 39:24.860
Want me to come over
later and tuck you in?

39:24.980 --> 39:27.020
No, at least not tonight.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.500
All right.

39:28.620 --> 39:30.180
Bye.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.220
You think an animal did this?

39:36.340 --> 39:40.900
If an animal got old Ernst,
it wasn’t of this world.

39:41.020 --> 39:42.260
Then what?

39:42.380 --> 39:45.140
Well, I can tell you what it wasn’t.

39:45.220 --> 39:47.980
It wasn’t some wildcat
like Judge Dixon says.

39:48.100 --> 39:51.180
A wildcat can’t make
claw marks like this.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.020
Some folks...

39:55.580 --> 39:57.060
around say it’s...

39:59.460 --> 40:00.860
Pumpkinhead.

40:00.980 --> 40:03.380
Pumpinkhead?

40:03.500 --> 40:05.780
What is that?
Some kind of a fairy tale?

40:05.900 --> 40:08.740
There is a legend about
it around these parts.

40:08.860 --> 40:11.180
It’s a kind of a demon
the hill people believe in.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.900
I remember hearing about
it when I was a kid.

40:13.980 --> 40:17.380
It’s said, if you’ve been wronged, -

40:17.500 --> 40:21.940
you can conjure Pumpkinhead
to exact revenge in your name.

40:22.020 --> 40:25.580
But if you do, you’d be
damned for all eternity.

40:27.260 --> 40:30.780
There is a nursery rhyme
about it, isn’t there?

40:30.860 --> 40:32.740
How’s it go?

40:32.860 --> 40:35.940
Bolted doors -

40:36.060 --> 40:38.900
and windows barred.

40:39.020 --> 40:43.260
Guard dogs prowling in the yard.

40:43.340 --> 40:46.140
Won’t protect you in your bed.

40:46.220 --> 40:48.860
Nothing will -

40:48.980 --> 40:50.780
from Pumpkinhead.

42:28.420 --> 42:31.260
Come on, baby. Come on.

42:31.380 --> 42:34.020
Oh, don’t stop.

42:34.140 --> 42:36.700
Oh, don’t stop.

42:36.820 --> 42:39.460
Ain’t nothing gonna stop me, honey.

42:39.580 --> 42:40.580
Ain’t nothing.

42:57.420 --> 43:00.780
My wife says you can’t teach
an old dog new tricks.

43:00.900 --> 43:05.420
She just must have forgot
the way you like to be petted.

43:05.540 --> 43:08.900
Besides, some things
just get better with age.

43:14.060 --> 43:15.700
More out in the truck.

43:40.300 --> 43:43.220
Oh, this beats the hell
out of delivering mail.

43:51.940 --> 43:53.980
Looks good.

44:10.020 --> 44:13.060
Damn it! Jesus Christ!

44:13.180 --> 44:15.580
Get the fuck out of my house!

45:09.980 --> 45:11.700
Sorry to wake you, Sheriff, -

45:11.780 --> 45:15.260
but I thought you’d want to
know we got us another murder.

45:15.420 --> 45:18.300
Oh, man. Where?

45:18.380 --> 45:20.540
Out at Red Byers place
off connector three.

45:20.660 --> 45:22.100
You know where it is?

45:22.220 --> 45:24.020
I'll find it.

45:27.580 --> 45:29.060
Wings.

45:29.140 --> 45:32.260
That’s what it is, you know.

45:32.380 --> 45:34.220
Blood wings.

45:34.300 --> 45:37.660
I don't know what it all means,

45:37.740 --> 45:40.980
but there’s some kind of helter-
skelter type message being left here.

45:41.100 --> 45:43.860
It’s a message Red Byers
wished had never come.

45:43.940 --> 45:49.020
A postman who obviously stole
more mail than he delivered, -

45:49.140 --> 45:52.420
a goat farmer from the Hollow
and an old conjure woman.

45:52.540 --> 45:54.780
What do all of these
people have in common?

45:54.900 --> 45:57.940
Well, Ernst and Byers haven’t
spoken to each other for years.

45:58.020 --> 46:00.580
Well, maybe nobody
ever spoke to em, -

46:00.660 --> 46:03.060
but somebody sure as hell hated em.

46:03.180 --> 46:04.740
This much?

46:04.860 --> 46:05.900
Look, -

46:06.020 --> 46:08.540
what you got here is
some psycho out there -

46:08.660 --> 46:12.820
killing for fun and taking
the credit for the work.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.140
Uh-huh.

46:14.260 --> 46:15.540
What’s this?

46:20.420 --> 46:23.380
Safe-deposit box key, it looks like.

46:23.460 --> 46:25.780
I don’t think that'll
help you find the killer.

46:25.900 --> 46:28.580
But I think this might.

46:30.100 --> 46:31.780
I did a field test.

46:31.860 --> 46:34.220
And all the blood is type O.

46:34.340 --> 46:35.780
Same as Byer's...

46:35.860 --> 46:37.260
except this one.

46:37.340 --> 46:39.260
I believe this is the killer’s blood.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.900
- Get back.
- Oh, shit.

46:44.980 --> 46:47.340
Hold her still!

46:50.420 --> 46:52.340
- There.
- That’s it.

46:52.420 --> 46:53.780
It’s okay. It’s okay.

46:53.900 --> 46:56.900
Easy now. Easy.

46:58.140 --> 46:59.780
Oh, sweet Jesus.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.900
- It’s like she’s not even here.
- She’s not.

47:02.020 --> 47:04.980
Whatever she saw scared her so
bad her mind couldn’t deal with it -

47:05.060 --> 47:06.860
and it shut down.

47:06.980 --> 47:11.020
It’s one step away from
being scared to death.

47:17.180 --> 47:20.180
Sheriff. People are saying
it’s some sort of a monster.

47:20.300 --> 47:21.700
A demon!

47:21.820 --> 47:24.300
Have you made any
progress, any clues?

47:24.420 --> 47:25.860
Sheriff, you better catch him.

47:25.940 --> 47:28.500
I’m working on it, ladies.
I’m working on it.

47:28.620 --> 47:32.340
- So did you boys raid the armory?
- We’re here with the judge.

47:32.420 --> 47:35.900
If you’ve still got these guns when I
come out, I’m hauling your asses off.

47:39.020 --> 47:42.060
He just walked in the door now.

47:49.380 --> 47:50.700
Are we comfortable?

47:53.740 --> 47:57.020
Unless my calendar’s
running a little slow, Judge, -

47:57.140 --> 48:00.660
I’d say that wild bunch of yours
out there is a few weeks too early -

48:00.780 --> 48:02.740
to be walking around
with hunting rifles.

48:02.820 --> 48:07.700
Not when there is hunting
to be done presently, Sheriff.

48:07.820 --> 48:10.460
I understand that folks are
shook up about these killings, -

48:10.580 --> 48:14.180
but you should know better than I
that it takes a hell of a lot more -

48:14.300 --> 48:17.940
to catch a killer than to load
a rifle and form a posse.

48:18.060 --> 48:20.580
We have our ways in this town.

48:20.700 --> 48:22.900
A little buckshot solves
a lot of problems.

48:23.020 --> 48:25.740
Well, that’s just great.

48:25.860 --> 48:29.020
And what if your way kills
the wrong person, huh?

48:29.140 --> 48:31.300
Boy.

48:31.380 --> 48:34.940
Correct me if I’m wrong, -

48:35.060 --> 48:39.060
but I don’t think you would know
one way or the other, would ya?

48:39.180 --> 48:43.820
Judge, as long as
I’m wearing this badge, -

48:43.940 --> 48:46.300
we break this case my way.

48:56.220 --> 48:58.700
Danny! I...

48:58.780 --> 49:01.260
Just stop.
I really don’t feel like this.

49:03.180 --> 49:04.980
What’s the matter?
I thought you wanted to.

49:05.100 --> 49:07.340
What’s the matter?

49:07.420 --> 49:10.340
Danny, there was
another killing last night.

49:10.420 --> 49:13.140
And my dad thinks it has
something to do with...

49:13.220 --> 49:14.860
what happened out
at Miss Osie's place.

49:16.060 --> 49:18.020
You didn’t say anything, did you?

49:18.140 --> 49:20.700
Of course I didn’t say anything.

49:21.820 --> 49:23.460
But...

49:23.580 --> 49:25.780
- But what?
- Maybe I should.

49:25.860 --> 49:27.140
Are you nuts?

49:27.260 --> 49:29.820
Look, if you tell him the
fire wasn’t our fault, -

49:29.900 --> 49:31.660
- I mean...
- Look, they’re gonna slam us.

49:31.740 --> 49:34.020
You can bet nobody’s gonna
believe it was an accident.

49:34.140 --> 49:35.660
Maybe my dad will.

49:39.260 --> 49:40.820
Look, Jen.

49:40.940 --> 49:44.860
We didn’t do this alone, not really.

49:44.980 --> 49:48.340
I'll take care of everything, okay?
Don’t worry about it.

49:48.420 --> 49:50.340
You all right?

49:54.340 --> 49:56.860
- Oh, shit.
- I gotta go.

49:58.660 --> 50:01.340
All right, but we’re all getting
together tomorrow at my place.

50:01.460 --> 50:03.100
Okay.

50:05.900 --> 50:07.300
Be there.

50:22.740 --> 50:25.220
We saw you talking to Jenny.

50:25.340 --> 50:26.940
What are you guys talking about?

50:27.020 --> 50:29.780
No, let me guess.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.740
She wants to rat us out, right?

50:34.300 --> 50:35.820
You’re out of line, Pete.

50:35.940 --> 50:39.140
Tell him, Marcie.

50:39.260 --> 50:41.860
Lindstrom sent me down
to the principal’s office today.

50:41.940 --> 50:44.020
There were some files on his desk.

50:44.140 --> 50:46.060
One of them was Jenny’s.

50:46.140 --> 50:48.940
Some real interesting stuff in there.

50:49.020 --> 50:52.260
Seems she got into some pretty
bad trouble at her old school.

50:52.380 --> 50:54.140
She and some friends
stole a teacher’s car.

50:54.220 --> 50:56.540
They got caught.

50:56.620 --> 50:59.140
Funny thing, though.

50:59.220 --> 51:02.580
Jenny was the only one
who wasn’t charged.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.700
She squealed to her old man, Danny.

51:04.820 --> 51:07.820
So her old man pulled a few strings
and got her out of a bad scene.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.900
That doesn’t mean
she squealed on anybody.

51:11.940 --> 51:13.740
There’s something else.

51:13.860 --> 51:16.900
We’ve heard all the talk, Danny.

51:17.020 --> 51:19.740
All that... stuff about Pumpkinhead.

51:19.860 --> 51:21.900
Yeah, so?

51:24.700 --> 51:27.500
What if that body we dug up...
What if...

51:27.580 --> 51:30.060
What? What if it was Pumpkinhead?

51:30.180 --> 51:33.340
What if we brought him back to life
and he’s out there killing people?

51:33.420 --> 51:35.860
What if he is?
What if he comes after us?

51:35.980 --> 51:37.940
Jesus, you guys are pathetic.

51:38.060 --> 51:40.580
How do you know we didn’t
do something out there?

51:40.700 --> 51:44.020
That was some pretty bad shit
we were messing with, Danny.

51:45.180 --> 51:46.660
All right, fine.

51:46.740 --> 51:48.500
Danny will take you out there -

51:48.580 --> 51:51.380
and show you that no monster
crawled out of that box.

51:51.500 --> 51:53.300
Then maybe you'll
leave me the fuck alone.

51:55.140 --> 51:58.980
Sure, Danny. Sure.

52:04.380 --> 52:06.460
So, what have we got here?

52:06.580 --> 52:09.260
Well, what’s left of
Red Byer's life, I guess.

52:09.380 --> 52:11.620
Let’s see what’s in here.

52:11.740 --> 52:13.220
Legal papers...

52:15.460 --> 52:17.340
Jewelry.

52:19.620 --> 52:21.420
Some money.

52:23.460 --> 52:25.460
And these.

52:28.780 --> 52:32.540
"Deformed Boy Runs Wild in Hills."

52:32.620 --> 52:35.380
When I was a kid, there was an
orphan boy who lived in the woods.

52:35.500 --> 52:37.860
Nobody knew where he came from.

52:37.980 --> 52:41.700
People thought he was a freak
of nature, a reject from the circus.

52:41.820 --> 52:43.700
Some people actually
believed he wasn’t even human.

52:43.820 --> 52:45.660
Oh, that’s horrible.

52:45.780 --> 52:48.060
As far as any of us were concerned, -

52:48.180 --> 52:50.340
he’d raised himself in the woods.

52:50.460 --> 52:51.980
His name was...

52:52.100 --> 52:54.500
Thomas Parnell.

52:54.580 --> 52:57.500
People thought he was
a geek or something.

52:57.580 --> 53:00.700
The story goes, okay,
that if he found you alone, -

53:00.820 --> 53:04.300
he would rip your heart out and eat it right
there, so you had to watch as you died.

53:06.900 --> 53:12.100
All those horrible things they said
about Tommy just simply were untrue.

53:12.220 --> 53:14.980
I never told you this...

53:15.060 --> 53:17.940
but when I was seven years old, -

53:18.060 --> 53:21.420
I used to play by that old
abandoned railroad mineshaft.

53:23.540 --> 53:26.060
One day, I’d left a toy there.

53:26.140 --> 53:29.220
And when I went back to
get it the next morning...

53:30.900 --> 53:33.380
there he was.

54:28.820 --> 54:31.820
Tommy was just a
little boy, like me, -

54:31.900 --> 54:34.340
grateful that I had saved his life.

54:34.460 --> 54:37.220
We moved away shortly after that.

54:38.340 --> 54:40.260
I never saw him again.

54:43.980 --> 54:45.500
According to this clipping, -

54:47.580 --> 54:49.780
he hung himself -

54:49.900 --> 54:52.020
in 1958.

54:53.100 --> 54:54.580
I don’t get it.

54:56.060 --> 54:58.300
Why would a retired postman -

54:58.420 --> 55:00.900
keep hidden under lock and key clippings -

55:01.020 --> 55:05.460
about a deformed boy
who died 35 years ago.

55:10.540 --> 55:12.140
I’m really glad you came.

55:12.260 --> 55:15.540
Thomas Parnell, an orphan,
died in 1958.

55:15.660 --> 55:18.500
I need to see the coroner’s report.

55:18.580 --> 55:20.180
I can get them, but it'll take time.

55:20.300 --> 55:21.580
Do it.

55:21.700 --> 55:23.260
Now, what’s so important?

55:23.380 --> 55:25.860
I did an analysis of the blood
out at Red Byer's place...

55:25.980 --> 55:28.780
- The blood of the killer.
- Yeah.

55:28.860 --> 55:30.900
I’ve never seen blood
like this before.

55:31.020 --> 55:33.700
I know it sounds crazy.

55:33.820 --> 55:35.940
But whatever's out
there doing the killing -

55:36.060 --> 55:38.020
is unlike any life I know.

55:38.100 --> 55:39.900
It’s... some kind of...

55:39.980 --> 55:41.260
Monster?

55:42.300 --> 55:44.100
You think it’s the legend, hmm?

55:44.220 --> 55:46.100
Pumpkinhead? Is that what
you’re trying to tell me?

55:46.180 --> 55:48.580
I don’t know what it is.

55:48.700 --> 55:51.180
All I know is, it’s not an animal.

55:51.300 --> 55:53.460
It’s not human. So, what is it?

56:04.780 --> 56:07.140
Gentlemen, may we help you?

56:07.260 --> 56:10.180
- The mayor’s been looking for you.
- Yeah, you!

56:10.300 --> 56:13.100
I’ve been doing everything
in my power to deal with this.

56:13.180 --> 56:14.580
I’m sure you have.

56:14.700 --> 56:16.580
But you must have heard the talk -

56:16.700 --> 56:20.020
that maybe what we’re dealing
with here ain’t human.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.820
Do you believe that?

56:23.940 --> 56:25.700
Well, of course not.

56:25.780 --> 56:27.300
But a lot of folks do.

56:27.420 --> 56:30.460
A lot of tourists... do,
if you know what I mean.

56:30.580 --> 56:33.940
No, I can’t say that I do.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.660
Well, let me put it this way.

56:37.780 --> 56:39.580
The Loch Ness Monster.

56:39.660 --> 56:42.220
The Abominable Snowman.

56:42.340 --> 56:43.540
Big Foot.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.060
That stuff is big business.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.700
The way I see it, this thing
could put us on the map.

56:47.820 --> 56:50.860
I got a couple of guys from the National
Enquirer all set to come down here!

56:50.980 --> 56:54.660
People have died here!
You do know that, don’t you?

56:54.780 --> 56:56.140
Tragedy, ain’t it?

56:56.220 --> 56:58.380
Well, so is the budget
of this here town.

56:58.500 --> 57:00.140
You get my drift?

57:02.260 --> 57:03.980
If you’ll excuse me.

57:04.100 --> 57:06.900
Thank you.

57:07.020 --> 57:09.300
I want that creature, Braddock!

57:09.420 --> 57:11.780
Dead or alive! I want it!

57:11.860 --> 57:14.540
All right, kids.
Let’s take a look at your creature.

57:14.660 --> 57:17.060
Shut up.

57:19.780 --> 57:22.740
- Oh, man!
- Goddamn.

57:22.860 --> 57:25.700
I told ya, you shouldn’t have
done it, Danny! I told you!

57:25.780 --> 57:27.820
Would you shut up, Paulie?
It means nothing!

57:27.940 --> 57:30.380
Nothing? The body’s gone, Danny.

57:30.500 --> 57:34.420
- The spell worked, man.
- Oh, Christ.

57:34.540 --> 57:36.500
I told you guys before, -

57:36.620 --> 57:39.500
you cannot raise the dead!

57:39.620 --> 57:40.780
Right.

57:40.860 --> 57:44.220
Then tell that to whatever
used to be buried down there!

57:46.620 --> 57:49.860
- What the fuck have we done?
- We’ve done nothing!

57:49.980 --> 57:51.780
Would you guys get a grip?

57:53.380 --> 57:56.620
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

57:56.740 --> 58:00.060
I told you. Guys,
we gotta tell somebody.

58:01.340 --> 58:03.580
You’re keeping your mouth shut.

58:03.700 --> 58:05.900
There is a good explanation
for all of this.

58:05.980 --> 58:09.900
And until we find out what it
is, we’re sticking together.

58:10.020 --> 58:13.060
We’re all getting together
tonight at my place.

58:13.180 --> 58:15.860
Until then, you guys keep
your mouths shut, you got it?

58:15.980 --> 58:18.220
Let’s get out of here.

58:20.860 --> 58:23.580
Yee-haw!

58:23.700 --> 58:26.540
Ain’t that a bitch.
Damn cock went limp on me.

58:26.660 --> 58:28.900
Ain’t the first time.

58:35.180 --> 58:38.340
Give it up, boys. Give it up.
Come to papa.

58:39.380 --> 58:42.020
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.

58:42.140 --> 58:44.140
Thank you, boys.
Pleasure doing business with you.

58:45.260 --> 58:48.100
- Suckers.
- See you next time, huh?

58:49.460 --> 58:52.420
- Not bad for a night’s work.
- You got that right, brother.

58:55.540 --> 58:58.340
Hey, you missed something here.

58:58.460 --> 59:00.340
I said you missed something there.

59:00.460 --> 59:02.220
She can’t hear you, stupid.

59:02.340 --> 59:04.500
Well, she’s got eyes, don’t she?

59:08.020 --> 59:10.500
Hey. I said you missed
something there.

59:10.620 --> 59:13.260
Can’t you see it?
Can’t you see it, huh!

59:16.380 --> 59:19.380
Come here. I hate when you do that.

59:26.380 --> 59:30.300
What kind of way is that
to treat our baby sister?

59:30.380 --> 59:32.140
You got a lot of room to talk.

59:32.260 --> 59:33.860
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

59:33.980 --> 59:36.020
I ain’t the one sleeping with her.

59:53.500 --> 59:55.540
What the hell’s going on here?
Brian! Fred!

59:55.660 --> 59:57.540
What the hell’s happening here?

59:57.660 --> 01:00:01.620
Brian, what the hell’s going on here?

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.900
Fred! Fred, what the hell is that?

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.900
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.540
I was driving home when
I picked her up -

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.380
on the side of the road half-crazed.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.900
She works out at the Knox brothers.

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.940
Sister, I think.

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.020
She’s deaf and mute, Sean.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.820
So whatever she saw,
she can’t help us.

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.780
I’m afraid not.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.820
But maybe this can.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.260
Whatever it is made a real
mess of the Knox brothers.

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.260
I’m gonna need help with the bodies.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.140
- We have to stop this.
- Stop what?

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.500
We don’t know what it is, let alone
where it’s liable to strike next.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.980
I don’t believe it’s
killing at random.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.620
Ernst, Byers, now the Knox brothers.

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.420
They’re all somehow tied in together.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.740
And the answer’s got to be with this.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.580
If we can just figure
out what that means, -

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.620
we figure out where it strikes
next, we get there first, -

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.020
and God help us, -

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.460
kill whatever it is.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.340
The legend persists in
rural American folklore.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.460
Deformed children were denounced
by mountain priests as hell spawn.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.660
Said to be the union of a demon -

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.420
invoked by witchcraft
to right a wrong -

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.860
and a woman born of mortal flesh.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.580
When a woman was suspected
of having intercourse...

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.500
I need to talk to you.

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.260
I thought you were at work.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.660
This is Jenny’s sweater.
She was wearing it the other night.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.660
It smells like smoke.

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.580
So she was at Osie's place.

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.060
All over again she does this to us.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.340
All over again!

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.580
The coroner’s report just
came in on Tommy.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.820
According to this, Thomas Parnell -

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.540
supposedly hung himself in this area.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.940
- Why supposedly?
- I just don’t buy it.

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.100
He couldn’t have done
this to himself.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.940
The contusions... they happened
over a period of several minutes.

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.340
They came from all sides of the body.

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:33.100
This is more consistent with
a bludgeoning than a hanging.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.980
So, he was murdered.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.500
Brutally. And somebody
tried to cover it up.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.220
But Tommy was an orphan.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.900
Now there’s nothing in these
records that indicates the county -

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.620
buried him in a pauper’s grave.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.900
That’s because his body was claimed.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.460
And guess by whom.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.860
Old woman Osie claimed
Thomas Parnell's body.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.780
But they weren’t even related.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.180
She buried him in that
cemetery near her place -

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.140
and tended the grave
lovingly ever since.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.340
Like she was his guardian angel.

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.860
What’s going on? What happened?

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.740
I lost her.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.820
It’s 8:19. I'll make the call.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.580
Damn it!

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.700
Tommy's guardian angel
just flew away.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.780
Sorry, Sean.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.660
It’s okay.

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.540
What?

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.100
It is too late to help me,
like it is too late -

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.940
to help the others.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.980
- This can’t be.
- Oh, my God.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.540
What do you mean, others?

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.060
The ones he’s going to kill.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.060
Is...

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.900
he the one who pulled
you from the fire?

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.740
Who pulled you from the fire, Osie?

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.020
Tommy did.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.220
This is a nightmare. She’s dead.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.340
Before I died, I was
the guardian of his soul.

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.660
Tommy's soul.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.180
A very special soul.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.980
His mama...

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.020
nothing special about her.

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.300
But his papa...

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.580
Go on.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:42.060
His papa was the one
you call Pumpkinhead.

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.140
The legend is true.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.740
Why... is he killing
all these people?

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:57.180
The ultimate vengeance
is the vengeance you seek -

01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:00.020
for your own soul.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.420
I saw him kill the farmer, -

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.380
the postman, -

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.900
and them other three.

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.740
They got what they deserved!

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.420
Them boys with them wings.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.420
Blood wings.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.180
Red wings!

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.940
He'll kill them six boys
with them red wings.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.100
- Six?
- There were five victims!

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.580
Who’s the sixth, Osie?

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.740
And what are the red wings?

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.940
And when he kills them six boys, -

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:38.980
he'll go after the kids
that burned me.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.060
Please.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.940
Help us, Osie.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.900
Tell me how to stop him.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.860
Take this.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.780
It may help you.

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.860
Red wings. Red wings.

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.740
There’s something
familiar about them.

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.340
There’s nothing in these yearbooks.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.380
Wait. Ah, here we are.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.859
Look at this.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.420
The Red Wings.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.460
It’s an auto club. They cruise
and hang out together.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.540
Who do we got here?

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.100
Jody Red Byers.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.859
Ernst Heller. The Knox brothers.

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:36.380
Who’s number six?

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.180
That’s Judge Dixon.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.859
It’s gonna kill the judge next.

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.220
Having a little party, huh, boy?

01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:01.700
Well, I got you and your friends
all set up in the little cabin.

01:09:01.819 --> 01:09:05.460
I had it stocked this morning,
so there should be plenty to drink.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.620
If that’s what you got on your mind.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.779
Hope you got protection, honey.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.100
Sorry.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:26.100
Oh, I’m cold.
I wish I brought my jacket.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.060
Wait here.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:45.700
- Here. Use my dad’s.
- Thanks.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.820
Those monsters probably already drank
everything my dad put in there.

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:04.060
- Are they there?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.700
Hey, this is supposed to be a party.
You guys are deader than shit.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.620
Look, man, forget about the party.
We need to talk.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.100
Then talk.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.340
That old woman... that witch...

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:30.140
Danny, she died!

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.660
Well, I’m real sorry to hear
that, but the woman was old.

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.660
She didn’t die of old age,
Danny. She...

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.220
She what, Paul?

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.500
You know.

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.860
What do I know?

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.900
Look, we had nothing to
do with that fire.

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.500
It was an accident.

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.660
Maybe if you hadn’t hit her,
she could have gotten out faster.

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.940
Maybe the fire wouldn’t
have happened at all.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:55.700
He doesn’t know what he’s talking
about, Jenny. I never hit her.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.860
I saw you do it, Danny.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.420
I saw you. You killed that old woman!

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.860
- He’s lying, Jen!
- No, you’re lying!

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.020
Look, we’re all guilty.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.700
Okay?

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.660
We’re gonna have to
go tell my dad, Danny.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:19.500
She’s right. You do what you want,
Danny. We’re gonna go to the sheriff.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.700
Like hell you are.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.260
What, are you crazy? Paulie!

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.540
Are you okay, man? Are you all right?

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:31.260
- Let’s get out of here.
- Nobody’s going anywhere until I say.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.340
What the fuck are you doing?

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.220
Get on the couch now.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.500
Put the gun down!
Put the fucking gun down!

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.020
Get on the fucking couch now!

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.700
Jenny said she was meeting
her friends at the judges.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.500
Good God, Sean, hurry!

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.580
Come on. Come on.

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.060
I know you’re there.
Pick the damn phone up.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.620
- Hello.
- Cory!

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.540
- Yeah.
- Judge here.

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.020
Listen, boy, I need you and
the others out here tonight.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.660
- Why is that? - Been too many
of my old friends dying lately, -

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.820
and I got good reason
to think I might be next.

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.380
How do you know that?
It could be anything.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:16.420
Don’t ask me how I know!
I just know, that’s all.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:20.180
You and the boys
get out here, muy pronto.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.740
And bring a damn arsenal with you.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:29.460
All right, Judge, I'll see who
I can round up on short notice.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.100
- Hold on a second.
- What?

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.340
What?

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.620
Hello?

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.420
Hello, Judge?

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.580
Sweet fucking Jesus.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.300
Judge?

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.900
Hello?

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.620
Holy shit!

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.020
Jesus!

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.940
Get your ass over here now!

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.980
Who the fuck are ya?

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.620
Who?

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.780
What the fuck are you?

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.220
Well, come on. That’s it, that’s it.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.860
Eat this, you fucking freak!

01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.980
Son of a bitch!

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.700
You.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:16.020
You. It can’t be you. No!

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.260
What the fuck was that?

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:30.580
Nobody move.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:36.540
It’s him, Danny. He’s here!
It’s Pumpkinhead!

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.300
Shut the fuck up.

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.900
He’s gonna kill us.
He’s gonna kill us all!

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.020
- I said shut the fuck up, Paul!
- Oh, God.

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.580
What are you gonna do?

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.180
What do you want from us?

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.740
Paul, I want you to go around back -

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.860
and I want you to get the car.

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.620
Just do it!

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.860
- Please, Danny...
- Just do it now!

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.820
Come on!

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:41.660
Fuck!

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:46.860
Paul’s been gone for a long time.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.260
Nobody move!

01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:58.540
The power’s dead, and so are we.

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:03.300
He’s gonna kill us
because of that old witch.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.620
Where the fuck is Paul?

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.900
What the fuck?

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.100
Go, go, go, go!

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.340
Go!

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.180
- Come on!
- This way! This way!

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.340
- Go!
- Spread out! Go!

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.820
Come on, Marcie! Let’s go! Come on!

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:01.340
We gotta get the fuck out of here!
Come on!

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.340
Here!

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:08.580
Come on!

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.540
Come on, Marcie! Come on!

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:43.540
Motherfucker!

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.020
You motherfucker!

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.500
- Dee.
- Over here.

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.860
- What is it?
- It got the judge.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.740
And there’s a dead kid in the cabin.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.420
Jenny’s out there.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.980
Come on!

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.220
Come on!

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.260
Dad!

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:20.940
Look! Go this way, now!

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.900
All right, let’s kill it.

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.340
All right, boys, lock and load.

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.660
Come on! Come on!

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.460
Go! Go!

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.180
Get out of the way!

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.180
I hear something.

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:01.020
Let’s go. Sounds like
he’s at the top of the hill.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.700
No, Tommy!

01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:08.180
- Don’t!
- Dad, help!

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.300
I’m not gonna hurt you!

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.540
Oh, my God!

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:19.860
Look, Tommy. Miss Osie left me this.

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.540
I know you trusted her, Tommy.

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:28.580
Please, trust me.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.500
Your soul can rest now.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:36.500
You’ve avenged your own murder.
You punished those who hurt Osie.

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.020
She’s not one of them!

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:46.700
I saved your life once right here.
Don’t you remember?

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:51.620
Please, she’s my daughter.

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:58.580
Please!

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.460
It’s all right, honey.

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:09.900
You’re safe now.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:12.700
Thank you, Tommy.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.460
Thank you.

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:20.460
Sean, the judge’s posse!

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.460
Oh, my God!

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.540
- Go on.
- All right, lock and load.

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.260
Go, Tommy.

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:31.500
Get the hell out of here!
They'll destroy you!

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.980
Move out of the way, Sheriff.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.380
What are you doing? Go!

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.260
Go, Tommy! Get out of here!

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:42.340
Stop! Hold your fire!

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:43.860
What the hell are you doing?

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.260
Waste him!

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:54.980
Eat this!

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:30.100
Drop him!

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.540
Drop him!

01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:17.180
Mom told me about Tommy.

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:19.700
How you saved him
when you were a kid.

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:24.060
He didn’t kill me
because he trusted you.

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:28.660
I’m sorry, Dad.

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.180
For everything.

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.980
What is it?

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.620
An old fire truck.

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:50.820
How did it get...
