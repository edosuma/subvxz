WEBVTT

00:07.441 --> 00:09.477
I mean, I thought
I'd never get in.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.212
I'm pretty much
the last person

00:11.245 --> 00:12.546
that anyone thought
would go to college.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.515
Truer words have
never been spoken.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.350
Yeah, man, but for some
reason, they want me.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.186
I'm enrolling in the fall.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.720
Thinking about
a major in English.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.723
Or... you just could put
a couple hundred grand

00:22.756 --> 00:24.825
in a trash can
and light it on fire.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.363
Help you gentlemen?

00:29.397 --> 00:32.066
Whoa, whoa... now.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.734
Move away from the car.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.169
Easy, fella,
all right?

00:35.203 --> 00:36.670
Troy's Repo.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.473
I told those bastards
I'd make the payment.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.075
I understand that,

00:41.109 --> 00:42.843
but you're gonna have
to take that up with them.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.247
I've wanted a Beemer
since I was 12 years old.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.249
You really think
I'm gonna let you

00:48.282 --> 00:50.651
just sneak it out
from under my nose?

00:50.684 --> 00:52.486
We totally respect
your feelings, okay?

00:52.520 --> 00:55.656
But, uh, this is a really
bad time for me to get shot.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.526
So if you could just
lower the gun...

01:03.331 --> 01:05.166
Good God.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.504
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:10.538 --> 01:13.174
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:13.207 --> 01:15.576
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:15.609 --> 01:16.777
* How, how, how, how

01:16.810 --> 01:20.214
* Hey, hey

01:24.918 --> 01:26.487
* You gotta come on.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.760
Oh.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.595
A man working
for his dinner.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.198
Any steak frites
worth having

01:37.231 --> 01:39.800
demand a proper
béarnaise.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.802
Not for the weak of spirit.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.904
Hey, you gonna fry these
potatoes in that duck fat too,

01:43.937 --> 01:45.506
right?
I got your back, buddy.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.141
Ooh-wee.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.376
Man, this food look good.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.878
I want to take a picture.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.547
Be right back.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.583
Got to put
my cardiologist on alert.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.819
Did you get it?

01:58.852 --> 02:00.821
Come on, Big Country, you know
you send me into battle,

02:00.854 --> 02:02.890
I'm coming back with a scalp.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.395
Ooh, it's kind of intense.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.697
I was looking to show
Pride's softer side.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.299
No, no, see, that's
where you're wrong.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.933
"Intense" is what the women
on NolaMingle want.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.368
By all means.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.304
I can hear them cooing
on the Interweb right now.

02:17.771 --> 02:21.242
Okay, what exactly
does that sound like?

02:21.275 --> 02:23.944
You know, maybe we should get
Sonja to chime in on this.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.913
Oh, she "gone baby gone."

02:25.946 --> 02:28.616
Said she had personal business,
needed a few days.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.184
Okay, well, if she were here,

02:30.218 --> 02:31.885
she would say
this is a very bad idea.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.255
I don't think Pride wants us
setting up his dates.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.457
Look, I love King,
but the man doesn't always

02:36.490 --> 02:38.459
know what he wants,
all right?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.294
:
Need I remind you, mate,

02:40.328 --> 02:42.496
the sexy detective
from the outback?

02:42.530 --> 02:44.465
Agent Parsons.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.234
Yep, now she's back
in Aussieland.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.901
Missed opportunity.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.204
Yeah, which will not
happen again.
PATTON: Okay.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.506
Okay, I'm officially out.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.942
PRIDE: Dinner's gonna
have to wait.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.212
Dead sailor in Algiers.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.448
All righty then.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.982
Hey, holler if you need me.

03:02.015 --> 03:02.950
What's with him?

03:02.983 --> 03:04.418
Oh, I ain't got a clue.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.959
Victim is Petty Officer
Second Class Mateo Ortega.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.994
According to witnesses,

03:14.027 --> 03:15.663
the petty officer
took a nosedive

03:15.696 --> 03:17.498
straight off the overpass.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.500
BRODY: Spot is
notorious for jumpers.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.569
It could be suicide.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.903
PRIDE: They see him jump?

03:22.936 --> 03:24.938
They did not.
Only saw the crash.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.607
Sounds like we should...

03:26.640 --> 03:30.010
Canvass for more witnesses, look
at security cams, I'm on it.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.679
LASALLE:
Loretta.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.947
Man, this car
took a beating.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.584
WADE: Unfortunately,
so did our petty officer.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.586
He has massive contusions

03:38.619 --> 03:41.589
on almost every area
of his body.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.558
It's all consistent with a fall
from a great height.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.561
Smells like someone's
been drinking.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.996
Bourbon, I believe.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.898
Like he took a bath in it.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.434
So is there any indication
this isn't suicide?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.869
It's hard to sort out much
of anything in this mess,

03:55.903 --> 03:59.340
but when I do,
you'll be my first call.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.345
WOMAN: Didn't get much
better than Mateo.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.347
Maybe the hardest
worker I ever saw.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.349
Operational specialist,

04:08.382 --> 04:10.784
helped maintain the Combat
Information Center.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.986
Diligent to a fault.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.555
Had to be, I suppose.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.390
Why's that?

04:16.424 --> 04:17.825
Mateo was born
in Honduras.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.360
Came from nothing.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.794
Dangerous place.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.796
His family got asylum status
in the U.S.,

04:22.830 --> 04:25.299
and he found his way
into the Navy through MAVNI.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.835
Immigrant recruitment program.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.837
We give legal immigrants
a pathway to citizenship.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.672
And we don't accept
just anyone.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.507
Best and brightest.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.310
I'm guessing when you heard
the word "suicide,"

04:36.344 --> 04:37.711
must have been a big shock.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.548
Honestly, wish it was.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.384
Something recently
had just been off.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.752
How so?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.387
He just seemed stressed.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.389
Arriving late,
losing his temper.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.391
One day, I even saw him crying.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.825
And we have
ways to help.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.594
A team of counselors
are always there,

04:53.627 --> 04:55.596
but yesterday he didn't
even show up for duty.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.064
Had to report him UA.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.599
Any idea what was going on?

04:58.632 --> 05:01.669
No, but one person
you should talk to

05:01.702 --> 05:03.671
is his brother Victor.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.340
He's an electrician
for one of our contractors.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.409
Should be around here somewhere.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.679
Need to ask you a few questions

05:11.712 --> 05:14.047
about your brother,
how he had been doing.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.083
As far as I knew, he was fine.

05:16.116 --> 05:19.387
Division officer...
thought differently.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.121
Guess I was wrong.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.023
Would he normally
confide in you?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.859
I mean, not always.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.095
He liked to handle
things on his own.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.330
Didn't want me worrying
all the time.

05:32.132 --> 05:36.103
Well, can't help but feeling...

05:36.136 --> 05:39.106
like I screwed up,

05:39.139 --> 05:40.941
like I should have
done something.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.376
What could you
have done, Victor?

05:42.410 --> 05:44.612
I don't know.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.480
It's not your fault.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.048
All right?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.082
You need to hear that.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.854
Listen...

05:53.887 --> 05:56.089
I got an older brother myself,

05:56.123 --> 05:59.693
and he's had his fair
share of problems.

05:59.727 --> 06:04.398
Always fell on me
to look after him.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.400
So I can relate.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.436
And you can't blame yourself.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.006
Take care, all right?

06:15.108 --> 06:16.510
Can I see him?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.448
His body.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.085
I just want to say good-bye.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.822
Wait here; I'll be back.

06:28.856 --> 06:32.460
Sebastian, Miss Loretta...

06:32.493 --> 06:34.462
I got the brother outside.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.663
Can he see the body?

06:35.696 --> 06:38.566
Of course; he just has
to sign some paperwork.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.101
Uh, but first you're gonna want
to take a look at this.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.003
WADE: Christopher, upon
initial observation,

06:43.036 --> 06:44.672
I suspected these were cuts,

06:44.705 --> 06:46.073
from the broken glass
of the car.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.741
But then we took note

06:47.775 --> 06:50.177
of the consistent size
and the curvilinear shape.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.514
And we realized these were
fingernail markings.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.848
Then there's this.

06:54.882 --> 06:58.519
A clean break of the hyoid bone
in Mateo's neck.

06:58.552 --> 07:02.823
Those are both consistent
with manual strangulation.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.959
This suicide was staged,
Christopher.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.877
Petty Officer Ortega.

07:23.911 --> 07:24.878
Tell me what we know.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.480
More like what
we don't know.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.916
Why he was acting strangely
and why he went UA.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.918
And why did he empty
his bank account?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.554
Nine days ago, his savings
went from ten grand...

07:33.587 --> 07:34.988
to zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.990
PRIDE: Anything pop
in his service record?

07:37.024 --> 07:39.226
LASALLE:
Nothing derogatory.

07:39.259 --> 07:42.262
25 years of age, excellent
performance evaluations.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.898
Spent the last year working
with the Coast Guard and ICE

07:44.932 --> 07:46.634
on a border control assignment.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.502
One thing we do know,

07:48.536 --> 07:49.970
according to Mateo's calendar,
yesterday morning,

07:50.003 --> 07:52.906
he was supposed to be
at the Nunez Center.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.808
Honduran Community Center.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.910
Mid-City.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.512
I'll check it out.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.748
Brody, see what our friends
in the morgue are up to.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.216
And I'll call in
the petty officer's mother.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.688
Gracias.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.858
Look, you don't have
to be nervous, ma'am.

08:10.891 --> 08:14.595
Ma hasn't had the best
experiences with the law.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.598
I love this country.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.000
But things happen
when you are an immigrant.

08:20.033 --> 08:24.838
Miss Ortega, there's only one
thing I care about right now--

08:24.872 --> 08:26.607
helping your family.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.875
Esta bien.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.546
Okay.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.214
What do you want to know?

08:34.247 --> 08:37.184
Is there anything
you can tell me about...

08:37.217 --> 08:38.619
who would harm your son?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.187
Enemies?

08:40.220 --> 08:44.191
No, not Mateo.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.294
Maybe people have a problem
with Victor sometimes.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.897
He is the
sabelotodo.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.032
The wiseass.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.101
Yeah, sounds like my brother.

08:55.969 --> 08:56.937
But not Mateo.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.773
Mateo was the good boy.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.341
Still living at home with Mommy.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.243
And what's wrong with that, huh?

09:04.745 --> 09:07.180
Let me tell you something.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.586
When we came
to the United States,

09:12.620 --> 09:16.223
we traveled 1,200 miles
from Honduras.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.059
1,200.

09:19.092 --> 09:23.664
And the entire time,
Mateo was smiling.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.666
Hmm?

09:25.699 --> 09:27.067
15 years old.

09:27.100 --> 09:31.071
With almost no food,

09:31.104 --> 09:34.074
no water, no shelter.

09:34.107 --> 09:38.078
And he smiles.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.714
Who would hurt
someone like that?

09:46.119 --> 09:48.088
You've completely
lost it.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.723
I must respectfully
disagree.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.891
I mean, look
at this dude.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.693
Pride's a stud.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.327
Now picture him
in a bespoke suit,

09:54.361 --> 09:57.164
maybe leaned up against some
kind of high-end automobile.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.167
You can't use a Photoshopped
picture on a profile.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.269
Can't believe Patton
got you into this.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.371
Do you know the one thing that
a woman looks for in a man?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.840
Well, since I am a woman,
I can tell you it's...

10:06.874 --> 10:07.875
High earning potential.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.409
It's a biological fact.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.211
We, as a species,
are attracted to stability.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.714
I'd merely be tapping
into that need.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.115
Okay, that's an
interesting perspective,

10:15.148 --> 10:17.050
but what's gonna happen
when the woman shows up

10:17.084 --> 10:19.419
on the date
and the real Pride appears?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.420
It's a minor detail.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.421
Oh, my God.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.723
All right, one to ten,

10:22.756 --> 10:24.257
what would you give him?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.660
Don't even think about it,
just throw out a number.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.361
This has "epic fail"
written all over it.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.130
Loretta, please back me up.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.299
All I know is I tried
setting Dwayne up once,

10:32.332 --> 10:35.035
and he ducked me
like Muhammad Ali.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.804
Come, there's some things
you should see.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.807
Once we knew the
suicide was staged,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.742
we began to dig deeper.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.077
And these marks are not
the result of a fall.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.779
It's septicemia.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.715
It's an infection caused
by bacteria in the blood.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.117
We've yet to determine exactly
what type of bacteria.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.685
This also septicemia?

10:51.719 --> 10:52.953
WADE:
No, this is

10:52.986 --> 10:54.688
another matter entirely.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.356
X-rays showed two different
broken bones--

10:56.389 --> 10:58.959
the trapezoid and the hamate.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.861
And these bones were
beginning to heal.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.395
I'd say this break

11:02.429 --> 11:05.132
happened in the last few days.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.366
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, the bruising pattern

11:06.399 --> 11:07.735
suggests it was caused by a blow

11:07.768 --> 11:09.136
from a small, compact object.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.738
Likely a hammer.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.439
So someone intentionally
broke his hand.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.473
It would seem.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.842
I'll let Pride know.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.476
Thanks, you guys.
Mm-hmm.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.478
WOMAN:
Mateo volunteered

11:18.511 --> 11:20.480
at least three days a week.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.415
200 people come
through a week.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.352
We find jobs, housing,

11:25.385 --> 11:27.755
sometimes just a hot meal.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.059
Mateo did it all.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.061
Mateo was attacked recently.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.796
Had his hand broken.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.898
Any idea who'd do that?

11:37.931 --> 11:39.499
He dealt with some
difficult situations.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.068
Domestic abuse,

11:41.101 --> 11:42.870
gang mediation.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.372
We'd like to talk to some
of the people Mateo helped.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.740
Of course.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.941
I'll get you a list.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.044
But, to be honest,

11:51.078 --> 11:53.113
it might not be the
best use of your time.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.782
How's that?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.483
Uh, people who come here

11:56.516 --> 11:58.485
tend to be a little suspicious
of outsiders.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.487
Particularly people with badges?

12:01.822 --> 12:02.790
King.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.858
"1821".

12:06.193 --> 12:07.527
Yeah, we got tagged.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.897
So did the rest
of the neighborhood.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.499
It's such a mess.
PRIDE: Gang graffiti?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.267
Looks that way.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.069
Never heard of 'em.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.206
Though maybe Mateo did.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.874
You know anything about them?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.009
No.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.376
Sorry.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.445
I'd rather not get involved.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.247
We understand.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.516
We'll look into it.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.820
Dwayne King Pride,

12:32.853 --> 12:34.487
meet Edgar Barrios.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.223
According to
the Street Gang Unit,

12:36.256 --> 12:38.158
he is the leader of the 1821s.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.961
Got up and running
four months back.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.330
Strong ties to the Sula Mafia--

12:43.363 --> 12:45.332
major cartel out of Choloma,

12:45.365 --> 12:47.134
which is where
he's from originally.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.536
Looks like the 1821s
are ambitious.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.840
Drug dealing, extortion,

12:52.873 --> 12:55.142
terrorizing the community.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.377
You saw how scared that woman
was at the Nunez Center.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.846
Yeah, and most recently,

12:58.879 --> 13:00.213
they started a network
of coyotes,

13:00.247 --> 13:02.382
bringing illegal immigrants
into the country.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.818
But here's where
it gets interesting.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.487
Barrios's frequent method
of intimidation.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.589
When he wants something
from you, you don't give,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.825
he tends to favor
home improvement tools

13:11.859 --> 13:13.426
like his trusty hammer.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.395
So maybe Barrios

13:15.428 --> 13:16.997
had a beef with someone
at the center,

13:17.030 --> 13:18.565
Mateo got involved...?

13:18.598 --> 13:21.101
Barrios brought his talents
to Mateo's hand.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.435
It's a theory.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.571
Know what 1821 is?

13:24.604 --> 13:26.606
It's the year of the
Honduran Revolution.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.608
Hmm.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.210
How about this?

13:31.879 --> 13:33.280
What do you say we, uh,

13:33.313 --> 13:35.282
bring the revolution...

13:35.315 --> 13:36.816
to them?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.862
NCIS! Open up!

13:48.896 --> 13:49.997
Federal agents!

13:51.664 --> 13:53.166
You hear that?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.201
Breacher up.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.915
Hey, in here.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.516
Underneath the floor.

14:20.994 --> 14:21.861
Ready?
Yeah.

14:22.930 --> 14:26.967
(people shouting
in Spanish, sobbing)

14:42.315 --> 14:44.184
(sirens chirp and whoop;
indistinct chatter)

14:45.285 --> 14:46.419
I'll be back.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.990
Talked to
a few people so far.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.458
All of them arrived
from Honduras.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.060
Been here two days.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.527
BRODY: Families in
the States paid Barrios

14:54.561 --> 14:56.229
to coyote them into the country.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.664
So if they already paid,

14:57.697 --> 14:59.299
why is Barrios holding
onto them?

14:59.332 --> 15:02.102
Barrios isn't what we'd call
an honest broker.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.336
Wouldn't release them
unless their families

15:03.370 --> 15:05.472
came up with another 2,500.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.375
They ain't had a meal
or a glass of water in days.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.216
Randy.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.417
Dwayne.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.651
How you been?

15:18.685 --> 15:20.153
Good.
Good.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.724
Brody,
meet ICE Agent Randy Wilson.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.593
Nice to meet you.
And you.
Called in someone

15:26.626 --> 15:27.961
I could trust.
Lasalle.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.062
Wilson.
Yeah.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.363
Worked more than our share

15:30.397 --> 15:32.232
of cases together
over the years.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.266
What brings y'all
into this mess?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.701
Edgar Barrios.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.304
Prime suspect
in the murder of a sailor.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.372
It's funny you should mention
that name.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.740
I just had a chat
with the Coast Guard

15:40.773 --> 15:42.375
about Barrios.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.277
Couple weeks back,
they stopped a boat

15:44.311 --> 15:45.412
full of immigrants.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.280
Thought Barrios was behind it,

15:47.314 --> 15:48.515
but nothing actionable.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.682
Good.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.284
We can take him down together.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.419
Come on.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.354
Let's start

15:54.387 --> 15:56.256
with...

15:56.289 --> 15:58.525
how did they bring you
into the country?

16:03.230 --> 16:04.597
"They packed us into a boat.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.034
There was no room
to even move your legs."

16:07.067 --> 16:08.235
WOMAN:
I was so sick.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.303
I just...

16:10.337 --> 16:12.339
closed my eyes and pray.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.606
WILSON:
"When the boat landed

16:13.640 --> 16:15.275
it was the middle of the night."

16:17.710 --> 16:19.779
"They put us in an old van."

16:21.314 --> 16:22.449
"Then they drove us

16:22.482 --> 16:23.483
to the house."

16:23.516 --> 16:25.218
Did you have any sense

16:25.252 --> 16:27.287
where the boat came ashore?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.322
Grand... isla?

16:29.356 --> 16:31.158
"There was a sign in the road.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.392
Grand Isle."

16:33.360 --> 16:35.295
What happened here?

16:41.401 --> 16:43.370
"That man, he hit me."

16:44.337 --> 16:45.805
"A hammer."

16:45.838 --> 16:48.375
WILSON: You wish
you could help them all.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.243
And maybe some we can.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.445
A few will probably get to stay
with their families,

16:52.479 --> 16:54.647
especially if they qualify
for asylum status.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.116
And the rest?

16:56.149 --> 16:57.784
They'll go through
deportation hearings.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.387
Sad truth is, most will be
returned to Honduras.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.721
Yeah.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.356
After all they've
been through,

17:03.390 --> 17:04.491
risking their lives.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.426
Believe me, I get it.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.328
After 20 years, you'd think
I could say I was used to it.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.562
Yeah.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.732
Listen, something unrelated
I wanted to mention.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.668
ICE started tracking
the American militia movement.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.372
They've been involved in some
hate crimes against immigrants.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.640
Your name popped up.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.175
I hear they put a...

17:22.209 --> 17:23.476
Bounty on my head?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.578
75,000.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.447
Huh, used to be 50.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.116
I'm getting popular.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.851
I just want to make sure
you're watching your six, yeah?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.420
Always am.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.188
All right. See you.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.523
Thanks.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.458
So...

17:38.491 --> 17:40.627
no one knows
where to find Barrios.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.529
And we still don't know

17:42.562 --> 17:44.331
what Petty Officer Ortega's
connection to this is.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.665
May have something
on that front.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.500
The woman I was speaking to
has a daughter

17:47.534 --> 17:50.470
who frequents the Nunez Center--
Paula Castillo.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.739
Apparently, she paid Barrios
to get her mother over.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.108
I think she's one of the folks

17:55.142 --> 17:56.676
that Petty Officer Ortega
helped.

17:56.709 --> 17:57.877
Yep.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.546
Right, so maybe he found out

17:59.579 --> 18:01.714
about the coyote network
through Paula Castillo.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.716
And Barrios killed him
before he could expose it.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.686
Now all we have to do is find
the son of a bitch.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.888
So I've stumbled
upon a significant discovery.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.558
I was trying to make
Pride's profile go online,

18:11.591 --> 18:13.426
but I couldn't 'cause--
oh, wait, look!

18:13.460 --> 18:14.794
He already has one!

18:14.827 --> 18:16.596
He beat us to the punch.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.398
I mean, I'm kind of glad

18:18.431 --> 18:19.899
he getting his groove back,

18:19.932 --> 18:22.469
but you'd think
I'd have known before you.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.803
What

18:23.836 --> 18:25.305
It's strictly a pheromone thing.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.439
I-I kind of got a sixth sense

18:26.473 --> 18:27.607
for when people
are getting it on.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.276
A pheromone thing?

18:29.309 --> 18:31.478
What does that make you,
like, the Booty Whisperer?

18:31.511 --> 18:32.645
No, no, no, no, no.
That's... What are you...

18:32.679 --> 18:34.281
Hey!

18:34.314 --> 18:35.548
Doesn't anyone around here
knock anymore?

18:35.582 --> 18:38.518
That's...

18:38.551 --> 18:39.786
I wasn't doing anything.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.492
I'm gonna make
an executive decision here

18:45.525 --> 18:46.426
and end this conversation.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.760
Love y'a...

18:47.794 --> 18:50.863
Okay, as far
as work-related matters,

18:50.897 --> 18:52.699
we've determined the cause

18:52.732 --> 18:55.235
of the petty officer's
septicemia.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.537
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, it's
meningococcal meningitis.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.239
It's a rare
and serious infection.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.208
Along with septicemia,

19:01.241 --> 19:02.475
it causes the membrane

19:02.509 --> 19:04.677
which covers the brain
and spinal cord

19:04.711 --> 19:06.346
to become inflamed.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.614
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, but here's the kicker.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.648
There are six
different variations

19:08.681 --> 19:10.183
of the bacteria.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.352
Mateo was infected
with Group W-135.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.821
But W-135 is almost unheard of

19:14.854 --> 19:16.589
in the United States.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.490
Where is it common?

19:17.524 --> 19:18.691
Well, among a few places,

19:18.725 --> 19:21.461
Southern Africa,
Central America...

19:22.762 --> 19:24.597
Mateo never left the country.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.933
So he'd have to be
in contact with someone

19:26.966 --> 19:28.935
who'd just been
in one of those regions.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.203
Likely, yeah.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.438
Thanks, guys.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.473
Think he knows
what we've been doing?

19:34.707 --> 19:36.709
Why don't you ask
the Booty Whisperer?

19:36.743 --> 19:39.212
All right, I don't think we
should latch onto that nickname.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.948
Okay? 'Cause it's gonna go
right to his head.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.884
The Booty Whisperer, huh?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.519
The booty what?

19:46.553 --> 19:48.955
I see word travel
fast around here.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.691
Just so you know,
I didn't coin the phrase.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.893
Kinda rolls off the tongue,
doesn't it?

19:53.926 --> 19:55.328
Booty Whisperer...

19:55.362 --> 19:56.596
PATTON:
In other news...

19:56.629 --> 19:59.532
I tracked down a security cam by
Grand Isle Port.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.701
This is where
the immigrants came in.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.903
This was taken
the night they got here.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.572
They said they came in
the middle of the night,

20:05.605 --> 20:08.575
and they were
picked up by an old van.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.477
This is 2:00 a.m.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.512
and that's a hunk of junk.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.547
Sounds like BOLO time.
I'm on it.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.349
Thank you.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.652
Talking with a doctor who's
treating the immigrants.

20:19.686 --> 20:23.323
One of them tested
positive for meningitis.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.991
Are the rest of 'em
getting antibiotics?

20:25.024 --> 20:27.594
As well as anyone who had
prolonged contact with him.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.796
Which sounds like
it included Mateo.

20:29.829 --> 20:30.897
PRIDE:
Patton?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.432
Yeah.
Okay.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.967
Go back through
Mateo's electronic life.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.936
I want you to scour
everything over.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.638
I'll do what I do.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.707
Brody, Lasalle...

20:40.740 --> 20:42.709
do a search of Mateo's house.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.577
Well, let's slow down a second.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.613
Mateo lived with his mother.

20:46.646 --> 20:49.516
Last thing I want to do
is make her life more difficult.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.750
You'll be respectful.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.853
We're missing
a big piece here, Chris.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.855
Gotta go where
the evidence takes us, right?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.861
(indistinct radio
communication)

21:03.630 --> 21:04.831
What are they even looking for?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.466
I apologize, ma'am.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.368
But we'll be done
as quick as we can.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.002
Look, you said you were
gonna find his killer.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.871
All right? Not get all up
in my mother's business.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.640
Look, I'd be just as upset

21:13.673 --> 21:15.742
if they were searching
my mother's house, but...

21:15.775 --> 21:17.043
you gotta
let us do our job.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.646
Don't!

21:21.981 --> 21:23.616
I think they should go.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.652
We can.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.720
But we're just gonna come
back later with a warrant.

21:27.754 --> 21:28.688
You people!

21:28.721 --> 21:31.090
Ma!

21:32.592 --> 21:33.760
Lasalle...

21:33.793 --> 21:35.728
there's something
you need to see.

21:35.762 --> 21:38.030
Check this out.

21:38.064 --> 21:41.534
The same van that was used to
transport the immigrants.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.741
What are you saying?

21:48.775 --> 21:50.777
Saying that Mateo

21:50.810 --> 21:52.979
wasn't trying to stop Barrios.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.548
He might've been involved.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.764
Mrs. Ortega...

22:13.666 --> 22:14.934
I have to ask you:

22:14.967 --> 22:17.437
The van at your house...

22:17.470 --> 22:21.441
You know if Mateo used it
three nights ago?

22:21.474 --> 22:23.910
That's the night
before he died.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.478
I don't know.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.580
Maybe. Why?

22:27.614 --> 22:29.949
We believe the van...

22:29.982 --> 22:32.719
transported
some illegal immigrants.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.858
Were you home that night?

22:38.891 --> 22:42.495
Yes... but I go to bed early.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.931
I don't keep an eye on Mateo.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.032
You sure
you didn't hear anything?

22:46.065 --> 22:47.900
The van starting,

22:47.934 --> 22:49.536
the garage opening...

22:49.569 --> 22:51.404
I told you...

22:51.438 --> 22:53.005
no.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.609
Then beyond you and Mateo,

22:56.643 --> 22:58.110
anyone else have
access to the van?

22:59.646 --> 23:00.913
Not Victor?

23:00.947 --> 23:02.482
He doesn't have a key.

23:03.916 --> 23:04.917
LASALLE:
Listen, your brother...

23:04.951 --> 23:06.853
I know you love him,

23:06.886 --> 23:08.688
but much as you care about him

23:08.721 --> 23:11.758
he wasn't perfect.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.760
I know the feeling.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.061
I've had it myself.

23:15.094 --> 23:18.030
Whatever he did...

23:18.064 --> 23:19.632
he had a good reason.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.200
But you don't know
what that reason is?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.969
'Cause if you do,

23:23.002 --> 23:24.571
you know I can help.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.605
Of course I don't.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.773
I would have told you.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.075
Sorry to have
troubled you.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.810
Thank you.
Mom...

23:34.981 --> 23:36.048
Dwayne...

23:38.751 --> 23:40.720
We got a problem.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.154
It's Mrs. Ortega.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.723
What about her?

23:43.756 --> 23:44.991
That van?

23:45.024 --> 23:46.659
She's the registered owner.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.861
Now, since it was used
in connection with a crime,

23:48.895 --> 23:50.463
it could threaten
her asylum status.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.965
I gotta take her in
for questioning.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.835
Randy... there's no evidence
she was involved.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.970
I got people looking
over my shoulder, Dwayne.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.472
It's a redball case.

23:59.506 --> 24:00.973
I gotta follow procedure.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.542
But once everything
calms down,

24:02.575 --> 24:03.843
then some things can slip

24:03.876 --> 24:05.011
through the cracks.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.679
You understand what I'm saying.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.749
I'm sorry.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.117
Really.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.087
Sorry, son,

24:15.121 --> 24:16.656
but I need to take
your mother in.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.057
It's procedure.
No.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.859
No, no, no. Hell, no.

24:22.695 --> 24:23.830
What are... what are you...

24:23.863 --> 24:25.064
Don't...

24:25.097 --> 24:26.733
Get off me!

24:26.766 --> 24:28.167
Hey, I said get off me!

24:28.200 --> 24:30.102
Guys... guys...

24:30.136 --> 24:31.538
Don't make a scene.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.073
I am sorry.

24:35.575 --> 24:36.776
RITA: Don't worry.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.051
That your idea of help?

24:51.691 --> 24:53.092
RITA:
Niños!

24:55.695 --> 24:57.129
(laughter and chatter
over phone)

24:57.163 --> 24:59.065
Hey.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.033
What you got there?

25:01.067 --> 25:05.137
Patton found this
on Mateo's Facebook.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.645
When my mom was cooking,

25:12.679 --> 25:14.180
Cade and I used to

25:14.213 --> 25:16.115
have burping contests
to distract her.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.017
Terrible.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.186
We'd get
a can of Coke...

25:20.219 --> 25:21.654
and just belt out
our A-B-C's

25:21.688 --> 25:23.155
as loud as we could.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.724
Yeah, she hated us.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.125
There's a shock.

25:26.158 --> 25:29.829
Here's what I don't get:

25:29.862 --> 25:32.799
why Mateo,
a respected Navy sailor,

25:32.832 --> 25:35.668
is connected
to a guy like Barrios?

25:35.702 --> 25:39.138
And if they're working together
bringing people over...

25:39.171 --> 25:41.340
why does Barrios
turn around and kill him?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.242
That, I don't know.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.917
Doesn't look like we'll
get a chance to ask him.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.987
Lovely place
to spend the evening.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.289
Eh, I'd prefer Sazerac's
at the Roosevelt Hotel,

25:57.323 --> 25:58.925
but what can you do?

25:58.958 --> 26:01.093
So... tell me things.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.362
Workers found Barrios
a few hours ago.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.599
Want you to note
the cutaneous bruising,

26:06.633 --> 26:10.102
the abrasions,
the engorgement of the tissue.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.304
Manual strangulation.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.173
Just like Petty Officer Ortega.

26:14.206 --> 26:17.176
And, just like
the Petty Officer...

26:17.209 --> 26:18.645
fingernail markings.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.748
I'll bet you a penny,

26:21.781 --> 26:23.282
when I get him on the table,
I'll find...

26:23.315 --> 26:25.117
It's the same pattern.
Mm-hmm.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.953
Wade was right.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.121
Same fingernail pattern
for both Mateo and Barrios.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.658
So someone else
strangled both of 'em.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.693
And we're back
to square one.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.762
Well, we know Mateo was involved
in the coyote ring,

26:35.795 --> 26:37.263
so it must be
something do with that.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.632
But we got no idea
why Mateo was involved.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.934
And even less of a clue

26:41.968 --> 26:44.203
why someone would want
to kill him and Barrios.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.405
I mean, do we have
anything else to go on?

26:46.438 --> 26:48.240
Found these in Mateo's drawers.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.409
In a stack of papers.

26:50.442 --> 26:54.280
Series of cash wire transfers
to a bank account in Honduras.

26:54.313 --> 26:55.948
Few hundred dollars every week.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.216
Are we looking at pay-outs

26:57.249 --> 26:58.317
to someone else
in the coyote ring?

26:58.350 --> 26:59.351
Maybe someone
with a motive.

26:59.385 --> 27:00.687
I've put a call in to the bank

27:00.720 --> 27:02.154
to see who owns the account.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.757
Well, let's hope it's
not another dead end.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.158
Hey...

27:06.192 --> 27:07.860
y'all having a party,
ain't nobody call me?

27:07.894 --> 27:10.029
A drink sounds like
a really good idea right now.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.865
Well, I say we stay sober
for the time being,

27:12.899 --> 27:14.266
'cause I got
something that's gonna

27:14.300 --> 27:15.735
lift your spirits
right up.

27:15.768 --> 27:18.204
Special delivery flying in.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.206
What am I
looking at, here?

27:20.239 --> 27:23.142
PATTON: This is Coast Guard's
patrol routes. I had to go

27:23.175 --> 27:25.211
Dumpster diving through
Mateo's e-trash to find 'em.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.213
Routes for
Grand Isle Port.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.048
That's where the
immigrants came in.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.382
PATTON:
Dated January 16.

27:30.416 --> 27:31.918
The night they arrived.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.219
So if the
routes are where

27:33.252 --> 27:34.787
the immigrants arrived,
was Barrios using

27:34.821 --> 27:36.723
Mateo's intel
to get the boat in?

27:36.756 --> 27:38.124
Maybe.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.927
But Mateo cared about his work.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.328
And the community.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.196
I mean, something
doesn't make sense.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.899
What we need to do is find
someone else in the 1821s.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.167
They're behind the coyote ring.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.301
They might have some info.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.337
Maybe I can help you with this.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.339
I found a second file
in Mateo's trash.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.809
It's the Coast Guard routes
for the same area,

27:56.843 --> 28:00.046
but this one is dated
January 19-- that's today.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.347
Another shipment
of immigrants.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.416
And a good place
to find an 1821.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.155
Apurante, andale. Vamanos!

28:09.188 --> 28:11.858
Apurate... vamonos, apurante.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.894
Apurante.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.495
OFFICER :
U.S. Coast Guard!
Get down on the ground!

28:16.528 --> 28:18.064
NCIS! Get down!

28:18.097 --> 28:19.065
Policía!

28:19.098 --> 28:20.266
Get down. Get down.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.333
Get down. Hands up.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.902
LASALLE:
Get down on the ground!

28:22.935 --> 28:25.004
Get down on the ground!

28:25.037 --> 28:26.372
LASALLE:
Drop your weapon!

28:26.405 --> 28:29.341
PRIDE:
Get down. Get down.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.843
LASALLE:
NCIS!

28:30.877 --> 28:33.045
Come out of there!

28:33.545 --> 28:34.947
We got a runner!

28:34.981 --> 28:36.282
I'm on him!

28:39.418 --> 28:40.419
NCIS! Stop!

28:42.221 --> 28:43.155
You stop!

28:46.025 --> 28:47.326
Stay down
on the ground!

28:47.359 --> 28:49.461
Get your hands
where I can see 'em!
Okay!

28:49.495 --> 28:51.463
Get 'em up!
Keep 'em up!
Okay, okay, don't shoot!

28:51.497 --> 28:52.932
Don't shoot.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.366
Victor?

29:06.012 --> 29:07.346
Pride get anything out of him?

29:07.379 --> 29:08.480
All clammed up.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.282
Won't say word one.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.418
Pride's gonna let him stay
in there and stew for a while.

29:12.451 --> 29:15.421
I mean, what the heck
was Victor doing there, anyway?

29:15.454 --> 29:16.856
Here's another
question for you.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.124
Did you know
anything about

29:18.157 --> 29:19.458
Victor and Mateo
having a sister?

29:19.491 --> 29:21.027
A sister? No.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.395
I called that
bank in Honduras.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.532
Turns out Mateo's wire transfers
were to a Claudia Ortega.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.300
His little sister.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.369
She's 18, lives in Choloma.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.071
Why didn't they
ever mention that?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.372
Here's the other thing
that's strange.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.440
She's missing.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.242
I called her
apartment building;

29:36.275 --> 29:37.944
no one has seen her
in five days.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.512
I'll talk to him.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.053
I know about Claudia.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.254
Does someone have her?

29:48.287 --> 29:49.488
Is she in danger?

29:52.391 --> 29:54.160
Damn it, Victor,
you gotta talk to me!

29:54.193 --> 29:55.461
I got nothing to say.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.263
Look, I'm the only one
that can help you.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.530
I don't know you.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.366
For all I know,
you're working with them.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.268
Is that why you're not
being straight with me?

30:02.301 --> 30:04.036
What?

30:04.070 --> 30:05.371
You think I'm corrupt?

30:05.404 --> 30:07.006
I can't trust anyone.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.240
Well, how far do you think

30:08.274 --> 30:09.408
that's gonna get you?

30:09.441 --> 30:11.377
Hmm?

30:11.410 --> 30:13.345
'Cause whatever's going on,

30:13.379 --> 30:14.947
you can't do it alone.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.018
Look, Victor.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.420
When we met...

30:23.622 --> 30:26.392
...I told you
about my brother.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.497
You and I both know

30:31.530 --> 30:34.934
how important it is
to take care of family.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.542
Edgar Barrios.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.479
His people in Honduras.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.115
They have Claudia.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.582
Why is she involved
with Barrios?

30:50.616 --> 30:53.519
It's not her fault.

30:53.552 --> 30:57.223
Claudia was too young
when we left Honduras.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.225
The journey.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.659
She wouldn't have made it.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.529
We tried to bring her
out the legal way,

31:03.562 --> 31:05.631
but with all the
violence at home now,

31:05.664 --> 31:08.000
my mother decided
that she had to get her out.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.569
So your mom went to Barrios.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.472
She even emptied
Mateo's bank account.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.574
So Mateo went

31:15.607 --> 31:17.176
to Barrios himself.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.510
Demands his money back.

31:18.544 --> 31:19.511
It was a stupid idea.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.646
I told him not to.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.681
Barrios broke his hand.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.050
Not just that.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.684
He decided

31:25.717 --> 31:27.153
he could use Mateo.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.555
Wanted patrol routes.

31:31.523 --> 31:32.992
They kept Claudia.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.626
He told Mateo that

31:34.660 --> 31:36.695
if he helped
just a couple of times,

31:36.728 --> 31:39.331
that he would
bring Claudia over.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.469
I thought maybe Claudia
would be there tonight.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.537
So Mateo trusted Barrios?

31:45.571 --> 31:47.139
Of course not.

31:47.173 --> 31:49.408
Mateo was
a United States sailor.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.443
Then the routes weren't real?

31:51.477 --> 31:53.479
No.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.617
Mateo said the best way
to get Claudia

31:58.650 --> 32:00.987
was to take Barrios down.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.489
He thought that when he went
to go meet the boat

32:03.522 --> 32:06.625
that he would have backup.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.527
It was supposed to be a sting.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.332
Who else was
supposed to be there?

32:19.338 --> 32:20.672
Randy?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.474
Dwayne, what are you doing here?

32:22.508 --> 32:24.010
We need to chat.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.012
Uh, if this is
about Mrs. Ortega,

32:26.045 --> 32:27.546
I only have to hold her
a little while longer.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.515
Like I said, just
until things calm down.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.483
Not about that.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.619
What's going on with you?

32:33.652 --> 32:35.221
Me?

32:35.254 --> 32:37.423
I've always been
straight with you.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.492
All I'm asking is you
do the same with me.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.628
Dwayne, you're gonna
need to talk English.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.197
I know Mateo
came to you for help.

32:45.231 --> 32:48.067
You were supposed
to arrest Barrios.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.601
Are you messing with me?

32:49.635 --> 32:51.370
Listen.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.739
I'm not here to judge.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.208
I can't begin
to understand

32:56.242 --> 32:58.277
what's going on
in your life,

32:58.310 --> 33:00.112
but somehow,

33:00.146 --> 33:01.580
you got in over your head...

33:01.613 --> 33:05.084
and-and Barrios
offered you money...

33:05.117 --> 33:07.586
No! No, Dwayne.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.789
So Mateo didn't come to you

33:10.822 --> 33:13.059
the morning after
the immigrants arrived

33:13.092 --> 33:15.561
to find out what happened
to his backup?

33:15.594 --> 33:17.263
No.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.564
And you never hurt him?

33:20.299 --> 33:23.769
Randy, you were the last person
to see him alive.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.704
And you didn't
tell anyone.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.507
Tell me you have an explanation.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.741
Why would you even think that?

33:31.810 --> 33:34.513
Because Mateo told us.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.816
Made a video, found
it at his house.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.718
He laid it all out.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.588
If he did,

33:42.621 --> 33:44.523
you would've
done something already.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.692
Well, then you'd go to prison.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.161
And you wouldn't
be able to help us

33:49.195 --> 33:51.197
find his sister.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.603
Randy, you and I,
we go way back.

33:59.671 --> 34:02.108
You get Claudia...

34:02.141 --> 34:04.110
home safely,

34:04.143 --> 34:07.313
I'll do everything
in my power to help you.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.421
All right... I'll do it.

34:15.454 --> 34:16.622
I-I just gotta...

34:21.460 --> 34:22.628
Lasalle.

34:22.661 --> 34:23.695
Fancy meeting you here.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.131
You're under arrest.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.832
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

34:26.865 --> 34:28.467
Dwayne?

34:36.708 --> 34:38.644
Dwayne, hear me out.

34:38.677 --> 34:39.711
For old time's sake.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.316
I got him.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.785
I know people in the militia.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.487
I got contacts.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.655
If there's another hit
coming down...

34:49.688 --> 34:51.457
You really think
you can threaten me?

34:51.490 --> 34:53.292
No, no, I-I'm saying
I can find out

34:53.325 --> 34:55.361
if another hit's coming.
I can help you.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.829
Why the hell would I want your
help after all you've done?

34:57.863 --> 35:00.732
Dwayne...
Huh? There's only one decent
thing left for you to do:

35:00.766 --> 35:03.835
Tell us where we can
find Claudia Ortega.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.839
She's a kid, Randy!
She's 18 years old.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.841
She's got a family
waiting for her.

35:20.386 --> 35:21.787
That's her.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.692
Claudia!
Mama!

35:39.871 --> 35:42.941
* I am a missing heart

35:42.974 --> 35:47.779
* No place left to start

35:47.813 --> 35:51.417
* To ever find my way

35:51.450 --> 35:55.954
* Around these empty parts...

35:55.987 --> 35:58.524
I don't know what to say.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.826
* Oh, I am a missing heart

36:00.859 --> 36:02.828
We worked with ICE.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.797
Got Claudia
expedited processing.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.334
She got her asylum status,
so she can stay.

36:08.367 --> 36:11.370
* In need of time...

36:11.403 --> 36:13.372
And the director of ICE
gave us her word.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.907
They're gonna
ensure that Wilson

36:15.941 --> 36:18.710
is prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.479
Thank you.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.815
Now go.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.651
Be with your family, man.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.653
They need you.

36:27.686 --> 36:32.524
* An open wound...

36:32.558 --> 36:35.327
Your brother's
lucky to have you.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.229
* I searched so long...

36:37.263 --> 36:40.266
Thank you.

36:41.767 --> 36:46.472
* And all that I found
is now gone... *

36:51.410 --> 36:52.778
All right,
I love you, brother.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.846
Yeah, Roll Tide.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.649
Think someone forgot
to send me an e-vite.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.319
Hey, Patton's been playing us
some of his old beats.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.388
How did we never know
you were an MC?

37:02.421 --> 37:04.590
Yeah.
LASALLE: 'Cause the man's
got a heck of a poker face.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.426
Almost as good as Pride's.

37:07.459 --> 37:10.329
That bill of goods
you sold about Mateo's video?

37:10.362 --> 37:12.264
That was a thing of beauty.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.832
Thank you.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.634
I got to tell you.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.803
There's a lot of things people
don't know about Triple P.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.339
Some may even think
I'm a man of mystery.
BRODY: Oh.

37:20.372 --> 37:21.773
Some might.

37:21.807 --> 37:22.874
But not everyone.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.410
Hmm?

37:24.443 --> 37:25.911
Want to turn that
off for a second?

37:27.813 --> 37:30.382
My friends...

37:33.919 --> 37:36.722
I am hip to your game.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.890
I had nothing to do with that.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.327
For the record,
I have been

37:41.360 --> 37:43.429
a firm hater
since the very beginning.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.830
I plead the Fifth.
Mm-hmm.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.832
My sources also told me

37:46.865 --> 37:48.867
that you've
happened upon a certain

37:48.900 --> 37:52.270
pre-existing dating profile.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.040
Whoa, you think it was,

37:55.073 --> 37:56.842
uh, Doc Wade
that ratted us out?

37:56.875 --> 37:58.810
I got eyes everywhere,
Christopher.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.713
And I'm gonna tell you all
the same thing I told Laurel

38:01.747 --> 38:05.417
when I found out
she made that profile.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.853
Appreciate your concern.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.921
But I'm doing just fine.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.090
Ooh, look at that.
It's quitting time.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.892
Yeah.
Y'all have a good night now.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.462
BRODY: You, too.
LASALLE: Adios.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.630
Just so you know...
Mm-hmm.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.967
There's a lot of legitimate
hotties on this site.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.470
You might want to take a peek
at who's checking you out.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.937
Let's go,
Booty Whisperer.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.073
I'm just saying.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.077
Booty Whisperer.
