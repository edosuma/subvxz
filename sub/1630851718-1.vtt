Yeah!

01:58.418 --> 02:01.870
Welcome, welcome. What's up?

We're here in Hollywood,

and this is

02:01.870 --> 02:04.569
"Clash of the Cover Bands."

02:04.569 --> 02:06.920
[cheers and applause]

02:04.569 --> 02:06.920
Oh, yeah!

02:06.920 --> 02:08.762
Now tonight,

02:06.920 --> 02:08.762
two awesome tribute bands

02:08.762 --> 02:11.330
are going head-to-head

02:08.762 --> 02:11.330
for $10,000

02:11.330 --> 02:13.967
and the chance to be

02:11.330 --> 02:13.967
our ultimate cover band

02:13.967 --> 02:16.802
and perform on "The Tonight

02:13.967 --> 02:16.802
Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."

02:16.802 --> 02:19.806
- The stakes are real

02:16.802 --> 02:19.806
right now.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.108
We've got a lot to get to,

02:19.806 --> 02:22.108
but before we get there,

02:22.108 --> 02:24.978
let's make some noise

02:22.108 --> 02:24.978
for our expert panel.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.913
Oh, yes!

02:26.913 --> 02:31.418
He is a solo artist

02:26.913 --> 02:31.418
and the lead singer of "Queen."

02:31.418 --> 02:35.388
He will rock you.

02:31.418 --> 02:35.388
That is Adam Lambert.

02:35.388 --> 02:36.923
Yeah, excellent.

02:36.923 --> 02:40.159
She's a certified platinum

02:36.923 --> 02:40.159
songwriter that's collaborated

02:40.159 --> 02:44.969
with music's biggest stars from

02:40.159 --> 02:44.969
Rihanna to Katy Perry, Usher,

02:44.969 --> 02:46.231
and the list goes on and on.

02:46.231 --> 02:48.501
Make some noise for Ester Dean.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.603
[cheers and applause]

02:51.603 --> 02:55.908
And finally, she's a Grammy

02:51.603 --> 02:55.908
award-winning global superstar.

02:55.908 --> 02:57.877
Make some noise

02:55.908 --> 02:57.877
for Meghan Trainor.

02:57.877 --> 03:01.614
[cheers and applause]

02:57.877 --> 03:01.614
Oh, snap! Hey!

03:01.614 --> 03:04.317
Now every week, we'll be taking

03:01.614 --> 03:04.317
on a different musical genre,

03:04.317 --> 03:07.653
and this week

03:04.317 --> 03:07.653
is about stadium rockers.

03:07.653 --> 03:10.356
Adam, you've rocked stadiums

03:07.653 --> 03:10.356
all over the world.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.324
You have people fist pumping

03:10.356 --> 03:12.324
and all that.

03:12.324 --> 03:13.526
Break it down for us.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.620
What does it take

03:13.526 --> 03:16.620
to get to stadium status?

03:16.620 --> 03:18.131
- I think it takes a certain

03:16.620 --> 03:18.131
level of confidence, you know.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.165
When you're doing that,

03:18.131 --> 03:20.165
you've gotta own it

03:20.165 --> 03:21.967
because there's no room

03:20.165 --> 03:21.967
to be like,

03:21.967 --> 03:23.169
"Mm, I think that's good."

03:23.169 --> 03:24.903
I've done arenas for a while,

03:24.903 --> 03:26.438
and then when we get

03:24.903 --> 03:26.438
to a stadium, you're like,

03:26.438 --> 03:29.275
"Whoa, there's, like,

03:26.438 --> 03:29.275
70,000 people."

03:29.275 --> 03:32.177
It's a lot of energy

03:29.275 --> 03:32.177
that's coming at you,

03:32.177 --> 03:33.712
and what we're looking

03:32.177 --> 03:33.712
for tonight

03:33.712 --> 03:37.283
is that illusion

03:33.712 --> 03:37.283
that these guys are on stage

03:37.283 --> 03:39.385
in front of that many

03:37.283 --> 03:39.385
thousands of people,

03:39.385 --> 03:40.719
and they're connecting

03:39.385 --> 03:40.719
with everybody

03:40.719 --> 03:42.489
and inviting them to the party.

03:42.489 --> 03:43.723
Yeah.

03:42.489 --> 03:43.723
[cheers and applause]

03:43.723 --> 03:46.225
- Now first up is a group

03:43.723 --> 03:46.225
of Jersey boys.

03:46.225 --> 03:48.828
Now they may look like regular

03:46.225 --> 03:48.828
Joes, but at night,

03:48.828 --> 03:51.969
they transform into Rock

03:48.828 --> 03:51.969
and Roll Hall of Famers

03:51.969 --> 03:54.000
who have toured the world

03:51.969 --> 03:54.000
and have more Grammys

03:54.000 --> 03:56.135
than any band in history.

03:56.135 --> 03:59.104
Check this out.

03:56.135 --> 03:59.104
[cheers and applause]

04:00.439 --> 04:04.210
- We are Unforgettable Fire,

04:00.439 --> 04:04.210
a U2 tribute band,

04:04.210 --> 04:07.813
and we've been together

04:04.210 --> 04:07.813
for 20 years.

04:07.813 --> 04:09.883
<i>- I started to be</i>

04:07.813 --> 04:09.883
<i>a fan of this band</i>

04:09.883 --> 04:12.519
when I was 16 years old.

04:12.519 --> 04:17.856
- 1995, there was very

04:12.519 --> 04:17.856
few tribute bands around.

04:17.856 --> 04:19.358
<i>There was no social media.</i>

04:19.358 --> 04:22.262
<i>We had to rely on</i>

04:19.358 --> 04:22.262
<i>a lot of word of mouth.</i>

04:22.262 --> 04:24.531
<i>We were still</i>

04:22.262 --> 04:24.531
<i>sending out postcards</i>

04:24.531 --> 04:27.600
<i>to all of our people</i>

04:24.531 --> 04:27.600
<i>on our mailing list.</i>

04:27.600 --> 04:30.803
- Fellow friends and musicians

04:27.600 --> 04:30.803
would come down and go,

04:30.803 --> 04:32.504
"Why are you doing this?"

04:32.504 --> 04:34.406
- I think most bands

04:32.504 --> 04:34.406
would have quit

04:34.406 --> 04:35.709
probably in the first year,

04:35.709 --> 04:38.779
but we just kept pushing

04:35.709 --> 04:38.779
and pushing and pushing

04:38.779 --> 04:40.947
because we really

04:38.779 --> 04:40.947
enjoyed doing it.

04:42.182 --> 04:45.850
<i>- You're out there until</i>

04:42.182 --> 04:45.850
<i>3 o'clock in the morning.</i>

04:45.850 --> 04:46.853
The birds are chirping

04:45.850 --> 04:46.853
when you get home,

04:46.853 --> 04:48.922
and then you got

04:46.853 --> 04:48.922
to go work on Monday.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.923
- I'm a manager of accounting.

04:50.923 --> 04:53.125
- I'm a communications

04:50.923 --> 04:53.125
technician.

04:53.125 --> 04:54.994
- I'm just a plumbing

04:53.125 --> 04:54.994
and gas inspector

04:54.994 --> 04:56.562
for the city that I live in.

04:56.562 --> 04:59.832
My weekend fun is the band.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.370
<i>- I've never been</i>

05:01.668 --> 05:03.370
<i>to Hollywood.</i>

05:04.471 --> 05:05.805
- Me neither.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.740
<i>Just to see the sign</i>

05:05.805 --> 05:07.740
<i>up on the mountain--</i>

05:07.740 --> 05:09.108
<i>- For real.</i>

05:09.108 --> 05:10.377
<i>- Here we go now. Stand by.</i>

05:10.377 --> 05:12.579
- Get this show on the road!

05:12.579 --> 05:15.115
<i>- When we transform,</i>

05:12.579 --> 05:15.115
<i>it's like a superhero.</i>

05:15.115 --> 05:16.449
<i>Roy's gotta get</i>

05:15.115 --> 05:16.449
<i>his earring in.</i>

05:16.449 --> 05:18.584
<i>Tony's gotta get</i>

05:16.449 --> 05:18.584
<i>the right glasses.</i>

05:18.584 --> 05:21.521
It's explosive when the four

05:18.584 --> 05:21.521
of us are ready to go.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.124
We would love to win

05:21.521 --> 05:24.124
this competition.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.692
- Let's do this, boys.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.862
- This is the dream right now,

05:25.692 --> 05:28.862
right here, so many years,

05:28.862 --> 05:32.365
and we wanna continue

05:28.862 --> 05:32.365
for another 20 plus years.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.439
Let's go!

07:19.439 --> 07:21.940
All right, guys.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.940
I feel like I just watched U2,

07:21.940 --> 07:23.677
and I don't know

07:21.940 --> 07:23.677
if y'all had this moment too,

07:23.677 --> 07:25.377
but when he walked out,

07:23.677 --> 07:25.377
I was like,

07:25.377 --> 07:28.682
"That's Bono, right?"

07:25.377 --> 07:28.682
[laughter]

07:28.682 --> 07:30.115
Meghan, break it down for us.

What are the judges

07:30.115 --> 07:31.550
looking for?

07:31.550 --> 07:33.687
- So we're judging you

07:31.550 --> 07:33.687
on vocal impression.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.654
Do you sound like the icon?

07:35.654 --> 07:39.425
Physical embodiment, do you

07:35.654 --> 07:39.425
move your body like the icon?

07:39.425 --> 07:42.262
And finally overall

07:39.425 --> 07:42.262
performance, did we enjoy it?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.963
And can I just say A plus plus.

07:44.963 --> 07:48.401
Y'all are so tight as a band,

07:44.963 --> 07:48.401
and, Sir Bono,

07:48.401 --> 07:49.401
I believe you.

07:49.401 --> 07:51.137
You're incredible.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.872
Your vocals

07:51.137 --> 07:52.872
are actually amazing, too.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.274
Like, you're doing

07:52.872 --> 07:54.274
the right thing.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.709
You're doing a great job.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.843
- Thank you.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.790
- Ester, how are you feeling?

07:59.790 --> 08:00.779
- I felt very entertained.

08:00.779 --> 08:02.247
You know, Bono,

08:00.779 --> 08:02.247
you knocking it.

08:02.247 --> 08:07.199
You rocking it. But, you know,

08:02.247 --> 08:07.199
U2 is a huge stadium band,

08:07.199 --> 08:10.230
and I would like to see

08:07.199 --> 08:10.230
everybody put it all out there.

08:10.230 --> 08:11.423
You know what I'm saying?

08:10.230 --> 08:11.423
With your movement,

08:11.423 --> 08:13.589
just take it to the next level.

08:13.589 --> 08:15.728
- Thank you so much.

08:13.589 --> 08:15.728
- Yeah, you know,

08:15.728 --> 08:18.430
this is stadium rock

08:15.728 --> 08:18.430
that we're doing today.

08:18.430 --> 08:20.533
What I love is that you had

08:18.430 --> 08:20.533
that thing that Bono does.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.468
He really soars over a note.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.471
The best thing about being

08:22.468 --> 08:24.471
in a stadium

08:24.471 --> 08:26.740
is you have all of those echoes

08:24.471 --> 08:26.740
that happen,

08:26.740 --> 08:29.141
and he, like, works those

08:26.740 --> 08:29.141
echoes into his phrasing,

08:29.141 --> 08:30.509
and I could hear you

08:29.141 --> 08:30.509
doing that.

08:30.509 --> 08:31.644
- Thank you so much.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.546
- But we know U2

08:31.644 --> 08:33.546
is more than just Bono.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.715
It's a whole band.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.715
What we would like to see

08:35.715 --> 08:38.250
is the rest of the band

08:35.715 --> 08:38.250
come up to that level.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.619
- Absolutely.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.619
- The Edge, for example,

08:39.619 --> 08:41.287
he's the lead guitarist

08:39.619 --> 08:41.287
in a rock band.

08:41.287 --> 08:45.580
I mean, he is a star as well.

08:41.287 --> 08:45.580
I think what would take it up

08:45.580 --> 08:48.327
even, like, a higher notch

08:45.580 --> 08:48.327
would be to put all of you guys

08:48.327 --> 08:50.730
with our amazing

08:48.327 --> 08:50.730
movement expert

08:50.730 --> 08:53.332
just to give you that

08:50.730 --> 08:53.332
extra dose of stage presence.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.402
- Thank you, Adam.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.402
- So movement, listen,

08:55.402 --> 08:57.700
I can show y'all some moves,

08:55.402 --> 08:57.700
but I don't know

08:57.700 --> 08:58.504
if Bono really trying to--

08:57.700 --> 08:58.504
- Yeah, Bono!

08:58.504 --> 09:00.606
- You know, I don't know

08:58.504 --> 09:00.606
if you're really trying to--

09:00.606 --> 09:03.275
There you go.

09:00.606 --> 09:03.275
[laughter]

09:03.275 --> 09:04.811
All right,

09:03.275 --> 09:04.811
when we come back,

09:04.811 --> 09:06.446
we will meet their competition.

09:06.446 --> 09:10.830
It's a cover crew who's been

09:06.446 --> 09:10.830
rockin' together for 12 years.

09:10.830 --> 09:11.650
Now they've all got

09:10.830 --> 09:11.650
different day jobs--

09:11.650 --> 09:13.190
sound a little familiar?

09:13.190 --> 09:15.355
But at night they come

09:13.190 --> 09:15.355
together with one mission:

09:15.355 --> 09:18.258
to celebrate

09:15.355 --> 09:18.258
their stadium rock idols.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.625
Don't go anywhere.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.227
[cheers and applause]

09:22.227 --> 09:24.697

09:24.697 --> 09:28.340

09:24.697 --> 09:28.340
and I can't be saved *

09:28.340 --> 09:29.869
- You were flying and soaring.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.604
It was so good.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.440
<i>* *</i>

09:38.440 --> 09:40.312

09:40.312 --> 09:42.182
"Clash of the Cover Bands."

09:42.182 --> 09:44.783
Now it's time to meet these

09:42.182 --> 09:44.783
five guys from North Carolina

09:44.783 --> 09:47.653
as they unleash

09:44.783 --> 09:47.653
their inner stadium rockers.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.755

09:51.256 --> 09:54.494

09:54.494 --> 09:57.629
- And we have been a Coldplay

09:54.494 --> 09:57.629
tribute for 11 years.

09:57.629 --> 09:59.649
<i>* *</i>

09:59.649 --> 10:00.667
<i>- Patrick and I were</i>

09:59.649 --> 10:00.667
<i>19 years old</i>

10:00.667 --> 10:02.902
when we met at UNC Charlotte

10:02.902 --> 10:05.504
in the symphonic band

10:02.902 --> 10:05.504
rehearsal room.

10:05.504 --> 10:09.174
- He was playing piano one day.

10:05.504 --> 10:09.174
I was like, "Well, he's good,

10:09.174 --> 10:12.177
and I should be in a band

10:09.174 --> 10:12.177
with him."

10:12.177 --> 10:13.712
<i>We love Coldplay.</i>

10:13.712 --> 10:14.980
<i>- We always knew</i>

10:13.712 --> 10:14.980
<i>that we wanted</i>

10:14.980 --> 10:16.682
<i>to play more of their music,</i>

10:16.682 --> 10:18.684
<i>and so we just started</i>

10:16.682 --> 10:18.684
<i>collecting our members,</i>

10:18.684 --> 10:20.787
and here we are 11 years later

still loving it.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.654
<i>* *</i>

10:22.654 --> 10:24.524
<i>- I do my day job</i>

10:22.654 --> 10:24.524
<i>and do my thing,</i>

10:24.524 --> 10:26.525
but then when I hit the stage,

10:26.525 --> 10:29.863
I just wanna bring

10:26.525 --> 10:29.863
all that energy of the band.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.399
- Come along for the ride.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.366
- Through the years, all of us

10:32.399 --> 10:34.366
have gotten married and--

10:34.366 --> 10:36.200
- Had kids.

10:34.366 --> 10:36.200
- Had children,

10:36.200 --> 10:38.710
and this band has been

10:36.200 --> 10:38.710
a constant through that.

10:38.710 --> 10:39.873
- Rob was the best man

10:38.710 --> 10:39.873
at my wedding.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.875
- Yeah.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.875
- He officiated my wedding.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.576
- Love you guys.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.576
- Love you.

10:44.576 --> 10:46.789
- Love you.

10:46.789 --> 10:48.248

10:46.789 --> 10:48.248
<i>playing the local scene,</i>

10:48.248 --> 10:50.850
<i>the sports bars--</i>

10:50.850 --> 10:52.686

10:50.850 --> 10:52.686
- Yeah, and now Hollywood.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.200
- Hollywood!

10:54.200 --> 10:55.554

10:55.554 --> 10:57.923

10:57.923 --> 10:59.625
- It's the biggest thing

10:57.923 --> 10:59.625
we've ever done.

11:01.293 --> 11:05.649

12:48.268 --> 12:50.736
Love it! Incredible job.

12:50.736 --> 12:53.173
And something that

12:50.736 --> 12:53.173
I really loved too is,

12:53.173 --> 12:54.841
I can tell how close y'all are

12:54.841 --> 12:57.811
just by watching you

12:54.841 --> 12:57.811
watch each other

12:57.811 --> 12:59.346
while you're performing, right?

12:57.811 --> 12:59.346
- Aww.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.679
- Good energy.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.950
- You know what I noticed?

13:00.679 --> 13:03.950
The audience loved it.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.318
You know, stadium singers

13:03.950 --> 13:06.318
and performers know

13:06.318 --> 13:08.554
how to take all that energy

13:06.318 --> 13:08.554
and give it back.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.389
- Right.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.389
- Right, and this was like you

13:10.389 --> 13:13.590
felt the room loving

13:10.389 --> 13:13.590
what they just saw,

13:13.590 --> 13:15.394
and I felt like that tells you,

13:13.590 --> 13:15.394
you did the job because--

13:15.394 --> 13:16.763
- Totally.

13:15.394 --> 13:16.763
- You came and entertained

13:16.763 --> 13:18.365
people

13:16.763 --> 13:18.365
who came to be entertained.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.899
[cheers and applause]

13:19.899 --> 13:23.669
- Patrick, you nailed

13:19.899 --> 13:23.669
the movements to a tee--

13:23.669 --> 13:25.710
- Totally.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.710
- That I was so happy.

13:25.710 --> 13:26.472
I was like, "Oh, he knows

13:25.710 --> 13:26.472
Chris Martin, though."

13:26.472 --> 13:29.642
You were flying and soaring

13:26.472 --> 13:29.642
and sparkling.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.744
It was so good.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.711
Like, if I could

13:30.744 --> 13:32.711
give you any notes,

13:32.711 --> 13:34.480
I would just say project more.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.915
Especially in different songs

13:34.480 --> 13:36.915
with Coldplay,

13:36.915 --> 13:38.650
he's just like, chest.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.820
Like, he's singing

13:38.650 --> 13:40.820
as loud as he can,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.288
and then he gets

13:40.820 --> 13:42.288
to that beautiful chorus

13:42.288 --> 13:44.289
with the falsetto moment,

13:42.288 --> 13:44.289
and your voices,

13:44.289 --> 13:46.525
they're so good,

13:44.289 --> 13:46.525
but I feel like you can give me

13:46.525 --> 13:48.461
a little bit more

13:46.525 --> 13:48.461
in those verses.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.562
- You got it.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.562
- Yeah, you have

13:49.562 --> 13:50.562
such a good voice.

13:50.562 --> 13:51.663
- Yes.

13:50.562 --> 13:51.663
- Like, your voice

13:51.663 --> 13:53.990
is really beautiful--

13:51.663 --> 13:53.990
- So good.

13:53.990 --> 13:54.701
- And like,

13:53.990 --> 13:54.701
has that great breadth to it.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.869
- Yes.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.869
- But what we're saying is,

13:55.869 --> 13:56.870
like, Chris Martin has more of,

13:55.869 --> 13:56.870
like,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.804
a forward-placed thing.

13:58.804 --> 14:00.373
- When I have a cold,

13:58.804 --> 14:00.373
I sound like him.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.807
- Yeah, exactly! You know

14:00.373 --> 14:01.807
what I'm talking about.

14:01.807 --> 14:04.210
- It's true.

14:01.807 --> 14:04.210
- You know what?

14:04.210 --> 14:07.279
This is a competition,

14:04.210 --> 14:07.279
and falsetto

14:07.279 --> 14:11.250
is very hard to project,

14:07.279 --> 14:11.250
but we do have a vocal expert.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.852
You're in Hollywood.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.852
Let's get better and better

14:13.852 --> 14:15.955
so you can, like,

14:13.852 --> 14:15.955
go to the top.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.322
- Awesome. Thank you.

14:17.322 --> 14:19.192
- Now after hearing

14:17.322 --> 14:19.192
the feedback from the judges,

14:19.192 --> 14:21.610
how are you feeling?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.610
- I feel great.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.461
Thank you for all

14:21.610 --> 14:22.461
the kind words,

14:22.461 --> 14:23.897
and I definitely could sing--

14:23.897 --> 14:25.731
I know they don't want

14:23.897 --> 14:25.731
to hear me sing louder,

14:25.731 --> 14:26.799
but I'm glad you guys said it

14:26.799 --> 14:28.168
because I'm going

14:26.799 --> 14:28.168
to sing louder.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.568
- Yeah.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.568
- As you should.

14:29.568 --> 14:30.703
- Thank you guys so much.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.538
- That's what

14:30.703 --> 14:32.538
I'm talking about.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.139
All right. Now when we return,

14:34.139 --> 14:37.769
we'll see both stadium rock

14:34.139 --> 14:37.769
tributes fine-tune their acts

14:37.769 --> 14:38.544
for the battle round

14:37.769 --> 14:38.544
with some help

14:38.544 --> 14:39.812
from our "Clash" experts.

14:39.812 --> 14:40.846
Don't go anywhere.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.615
[cheers and applause]

14:42.615 --> 14:44.417
<i>* *</i>

14:44.417 --> 14:46.186
- * Lights go out *

14:44.417 --> 14:46.186
- I know you've got more.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.486
Give me some from right here.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.123
That's fire!

14:47.486 --> 14:50.123
That's it right there.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.792
- It's all about interaction,

14:50.123 --> 14:52.792
so playing into him,

14:52.792 --> 14:54.360
playing into him.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.928
Good, yes, that's it!

15:01.600 --> 15:03.235

15:05.504 --> 15:08.375
We have some tough competition

15:05.504 --> 15:08.375
coming up with U2.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.609
We are in it to win it.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.110
- What's up, guys?

15:09.609 --> 15:11.110
- How's it going?

15:11.110 --> 15:13.178
- How are you?

15:11.110 --> 15:13.178

15:13.178 --> 15:14.179
I love it.

15:14.179 --> 15:15.548

15:15.548 --> 15:17.484
- I'm Kuk Harrell,

15:15.548 --> 15:17.484
five-time Grammy Award winner.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.619
<i>I've had the privilege</i>

15:23.590 --> 15:25.580

15:23.590 --> 15:25.580
- Patrick, nice to meet you.

15:25.580 --> 15:26.759
- You too.

15:25.580 --> 15:26.759
- Man, I'm excited

15:26.759 --> 15:27.760
to be here with you.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.827
I saw your performance,

15:28.827 --> 15:30.363
and I absolutely loved it.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.599
* *

15:32.599 --> 15:34.634
<i>- The performance in front</i>

15:32.599 --> 15:34.634

15:34.634 --> 15:37.437
absolutely a night

15:34.634 --> 15:37.437
we will never forget.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.206
* Lights go out

15:37.437 --> 15:40.206
and I can't be saved *

15:40.206 --> 15:43.109
- You nailed his movements

15:40.206 --> 15:43.109
to a tee.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.711
I was like, "Oh, he knows

15:43.109 --> 15:44.711
Chris Martin though."

15:44.711 --> 15:48.414
You were flying and soaring,

15:44.711 --> 15:48.414
and it was so good.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.982
If I could give you any notes,

15:49.982 --> 15:51.717
I would just say project more.

15:51.717 --> 15:54.870
Especially in different songs

15:51.717 --> 15:54.870
with Coldplay,

15:54.870 --> 15:56.690
he's just like, chest,

15:54.870 --> 15:56.690
singing as loud as he can.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.124
- Meghan wanted to make sure

15:58.124 --> 16:01.126
that Patrick was projecting

15:58.124 --> 16:01.126
the way Chris Martin does.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.729
Chris Martin

16:01.126 --> 16:02.729
sings from the gut.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.496
Patrick was singing

16:02.729 --> 16:04.496
from the throat.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.466
The thing that I thought

16:04.496 --> 16:06.466
about looking at

16:06.466 --> 16:07.833
your performance was,

16:07.833 --> 16:09.635
it sounded like the key

16:07.833 --> 16:09.635
of the song

16:09.635 --> 16:11.403
was just a little too low.

16:11.403 --> 16:12.438
* Oh, I beg *

16:12.438 --> 16:15.341
* I beg and plead,

16:12.438 --> 16:15.341
singing *

16:15.341 --> 16:18.912
- So I was thinking maybe we

16:15.341 --> 16:18.912
raise it up maybe a half step

16:18.912 --> 16:20.447
because that'll give you

16:18.912 --> 16:20.447
the ability

16:20.447 --> 16:22.480
to belt it out more.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.490
- Let's do it.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.490
- You wanna try that?

16:23.490 --> 16:24.317
- Let's do it.

16:23.490 --> 16:24.317
- Yeah.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.354
* Lights go out and I can't

16:24.317 --> 16:27.354
be saved *

16:27.354 --> 16:30.756
* Tides that I tried to swim

16:27.354 --> 16:30.756
against *

16:30.756 --> 16:33.860
* Have brought me down

16:30.756 --> 16:33.860
upon my knees *

16:33.860 --> 16:35.928
- Beautiful.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.928
Now I know you got more.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.263
Give it to me from right here.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.264
- Got it.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.264
- All right.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.466
- Yep.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.466
- Give me your all.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.834
Let me just hear it.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.834
Let's hear the mistakes.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.690
* Lights go out-- *

16:43.690 --> 16:44.571
- It's like, that's the gut.

16:43.690 --> 16:44.571
- Okay.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.206
- I need to feel

16:44.571 --> 16:46.206
everything you've got.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.673
- All right.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.673
- So right from here.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.674
- Got it.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.674
- Boom.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.709
* Lights go out *

16:49.709 --> 16:51.769
* And I can't be saved *

16:51.769 --> 16:53.245
- More!

16:51.769 --> 16:53.245
- * Tides that I tried *

16:53.245 --> 16:55.215
* To swim against *

16:53.245 --> 16:55.215
- More!

16:55.215 --> 16:57.817
- * Have brought me down

16:55.215 --> 16:57.817
upon my knees *

16:57.817 --> 17:01.153
- Love those bends.

16:57.817 --> 17:01.153
So it's all about your body.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.788
It's all about

17:01.153 --> 17:02.788
giving everything.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.491
Like, when I produce artists,

17:02.788 --> 17:05.491
and if they're in the booth,

17:05.491 --> 17:06.826
and they're standing

17:05.491 --> 17:06.826
like this--

17:06.826 --> 17:08.228
- Right.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.228
- And I'm going,

17:08.228 --> 17:10.430
"No, no, no, no, no."

17:08.228 --> 17:10.430
Give me everything even though

17:10.430 --> 17:11.897
you got to stay

17:10.430 --> 17:11.897
in front of that mic.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.767
- Right.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.767
* Lights go out *

17:13.767 --> 17:14.867
- Like, come on, you know

17:13.767 --> 17:14.867
what I mean?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.102
- Right, got it, yep.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.102
- All right.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.604
Let's go up a half step.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.604
Let's get it.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.390
* *

17:19.390 --> 17:20.240
Hey, I know you got it,

17:20.240 --> 17:21.441
and this is going

17:20.240 --> 17:21.441
to make you work.

17:21.441 --> 17:25.111
One, two, one, two,

17:21.441 --> 17:25.111
body, everything.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.680
- * Lights go out *

17:26.680 --> 17:28.815
* And I can't be saved *

17:26.680 --> 17:28.815
- Ah, hold it, hold it, no.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.817
You started here,

17:28.815 --> 17:30.817
and then you're like, ahh.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.951
Open it up. All right.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.951
- Making sure I was

17:31.951 --> 17:33.859
in the right key.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.859
- Let's jump right on it.

17:33.859 --> 17:34.153
- Got it.

17:33.859 --> 17:34.153
- And jump right on it.

17:34.153 --> 17:35.822
- Got it.

17:34.153 --> 17:35.822
- One, two, three, hit it.

17:35.822 --> 17:39.358
- * Lights go out

17:35.822 --> 17:39.358
and I can't be saved *

17:39.358 --> 17:42.662
* Tides that I tried

17:39.358 --> 17:42.662
to swim against *

17:42.662 --> 17:46.660
* Have brought me down

17:42.662 --> 17:46.660
upon my knees *

17:46.660 --> 17:47.599
- Come on!

17:46.660 --> 17:47.599
- * Oh, I beg I beg *

17:47.599 --> 17:50.269
- He totally changed the whole

17:47.599 --> 17:50.269
way that I approach singing it,

17:50.269 --> 17:52.905
using my whole body, emoting.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.905
It was a game changer.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.174
- That's fire.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.174
That's it right there.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.310
When Chris sings, he sings from

17:55.174 --> 17:58.310
the chest, sings from the gut.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.547
You completely just picked

17:58.310 --> 18:00.547
that up.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.647
You're killing it.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.647
- Yeah.

18:01.647 --> 18:02.715
- Give him a hand.

18:01.647 --> 18:02.715
- It was good.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.651
- That's what I'm

18:02.715 --> 18:04.651
talking about.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.190
That's what I'm talking about.

18:06.190 --> 18:07.686
<i>- So we're in the battle</i>

18:06.190 --> 18:07.686
<i>of the stadium rockers.</i>

18:07.686 --> 18:10.589
- Our competition

18:07.686 --> 18:10.589
is Unforgettable Fire as U2,

18:10.589 --> 18:12.491
and I think Kuk just gave us

18:10.589 --> 18:12.491
everything we need

18:12.491 --> 18:13.625
to take this home.

18:14.693 --> 18:16.289
- Come on in, guys.

18:16.289 --> 18:18.664
Oh, there he is.

18:16.289 --> 18:18.664
How's it going, Anthony?

18:18.664 --> 18:20.500
- How are you, Ray?

18:18.664 --> 18:20.500
- I'm great.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.601
- My name is Ray Leeper,

18:21.601 --> 18:24.671
and I am here

18:21.601 --> 18:24.671
as a performance expert.

18:24.671 --> 18:28.307
<i>I've worked with Elton John,</i>

18:24.671 --> 18:28.307
<i>Snoop Dogg, Cher,</i>

18:28.307 --> 18:30.643
<i>numerous amazing</i>

18:28.307 --> 18:30.643
<i>recording artists.</i>

18:30.643 --> 18:32.278
- Nice to see you.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.278
<i>- So because</i>

18:32.278 --> 18:34.580
<i>I've had experience</i>

18:32.278 --> 18:34.580
<i>working at the stadium level,</i>

18:34.580 --> 18:36.415
and had to perform

18:34.580 --> 18:36.415
for big crowds,

18:36.415 --> 18:38.817
I'm really excited to take 'em

18:36.415 --> 18:38.817
to the next level.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.387
- * Touch the flame, yeah *

18:41.387 --> 18:43.655
- You really captured

18:41.387 --> 18:43.655
the spirit of Bono.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.625
- * Where the streets have

18:43.655 --> 18:45.625
no name *

18:45.625 --> 18:47.527
<i>- But U2 is more</i>

18:45.625 --> 18:47.527
<i>than just Bono.</i>

18:47.527 --> 18:48.728
<i>It's a whole band.</i>

18:48.728 --> 18:50.896
- You know, to Adam's point,

18:48.728 --> 18:50.896
you as Bono

18:50.896 --> 18:53.700
when you're the front man,

18:50.896 --> 18:53.700
it's not just you, right?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.167
- Yeah, no, it's not just me.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.167
- It's the band behind you.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.269
- It's everyone.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.269
- But if you're leading it,

18:57.269 --> 18:58.570
they're seeing everything

18:57.269 --> 18:58.570
you're doing.

18:58.570 --> 18:59.838
- Yeah.

18:58.570 --> 18:59.838
- Right?

18:59.838 --> 19:01.700
- When I'm back and I'm playing

18:59.838 --> 19:01.700
the drums,

19:01.700 --> 19:04.099
Tony is my focal point

19:01.700 --> 19:04.099
most of the time,

19:04.099 --> 19:07.279
and when he's got it

19:07.279 --> 19:09.315
I'm feeling that,

19:07.279 --> 19:09.315
and I'm pumped.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.351
- When we see the crowd

19:09.315 --> 19:11.351
coming back at us,

19:11.351 --> 19:13.486
it's like we're at a U2 concert

19:11.351 --> 19:13.486
together.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.255
- Yeah.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.255
- And the energy is just--

19:15.255 --> 19:16.756
it's just unbelievable.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.325
- That's how we want to feel

19:16.756 --> 19:19.325
when we see a concert, right?

19:19.325 --> 19:22.327
So let's bring up

19:19.325 --> 19:22.327

19:25.230 --> 19:28.867

19:32.204 --> 19:33.873
- Beautiful.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.873
Look at that chest.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.741
- * Where the streets

19:33.873 --> 19:35.741

19:35.741 --> 19:38.440
- Good, good,

19:35.741 --> 19:38.440
and now we're feeling it more,

19:38.440 --> 19:42.348
and now to your right,

19:42.348 --> 19:47.653

19:47.653 --> 19:50.190
Anthony, come forward.

19:50.190 --> 19:54.126
Good. Arm.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.296
That's it.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.265
Good and relax.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.201
Anthony, let me ask you

19:59.265 --> 20:01.201
how you're feeling first

20:01.201 --> 20:03.670
since we're focusing

20:01.201 --> 20:03.670
on your movement.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.872
- I'm feeling great because

20:03.670 --> 20:05.872
what you're teaching me is

20:05.872 --> 20:07.406
that you're not just performing

20:07.406 --> 20:09.576
in front of the folks

20:07.406 --> 20:09.576
in front of you.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.778
You're performing

20:09.576 --> 20:11.778
in front of the whole venue.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.247
- You have to be more external

20:11.778 --> 20:14.247
about it, right?

20:14.247 --> 20:16.750
It's more about sharing

20:14.247 --> 20:16.750
what you're saying.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.352
All right.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.352
So you've got your thing down.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.787
We're really happy with that,

20:20.787 --> 20:22.821
and so now let's bring

20:20.787 --> 20:22.821
your other bandmates forward,

20:22.821 --> 20:24.691
and let's work

20:22.821 --> 20:24.691
on movement together.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.493
And it's all about interaction

20:24.691 --> 20:27.493

20:27.493 --> 20:30.630
playing into him,

20:27.493 --> 20:30.630

20:41.410 --> 20:44.544
the rest of the band really

20:41.410 --> 20:44.544
stepped in and met up with him.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.945
- Good, yes, that's it!

20:46.945 --> 20:48.314
Excellent.

That feels great, better eye

Good. Now bring it down like

Bono does.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.690
Bring it down. Yes!

<i>- In rehearsal today,</i>

20:56.690 --> 20:59.224

20:59.224 --> 21:01.760
but is more aware

20:59.224 --> 21:01.760
of what's happening behind him,

21:01.760 --> 21:04.364
and we got him more engaged

21:01.760 --> 21:04.364
with his other bandmates.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.465
<i>- The energy is incredible</i>

21:04.364 --> 21:06.465
<i>that you've given us</i>

21:06.465 --> 21:08.680
and the eye contact.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.710
I'm already seeing changes

21:08.680 --> 21:11.710
in Tony and the guys here

21:11.710 --> 21:12.638
just the way they're moving

21:12.638 --> 21:15.442
and the way they're looking

21:12.638 --> 21:15.442
at me, and I'm looking at them.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.776
I mean,

21:15.442 --> 21:16.776
that's really important.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.345
I know it's all

21:16.776 --> 21:18.345
about the audience,

21:18.345 --> 21:22.582
but also it's about us coming

21:18.345 --> 21:22.582
together and feeling that,

21:22.582 --> 21:24.839
and I think

21:22.582 --> 21:24.839
you're bringing that out.

21:24.839 --> 21:27.869
- Sometimes I get caught up

21:24.839 --> 21:27.869
in all the gear I have,

21:27.869 --> 21:28.855
and I have my head

21:27.869 --> 21:28.855
down sometimes.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.890
- Yeah.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.890
- So I've learned a lot.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.192
Thank you very much, Ray.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.701

21:41.701 --> 21:43.470

21:51.944 --> 21:54.547

It's not about changing

21:54.547 --> 21:57.217
what you already do.

21:57.217 --> 21:59.251
You just need to inject

21:57.217 --> 21:59.251
some energy into it.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.702
in a foreign field *

26:43.702 --> 26:47.730
* For some reason

26:43.702 --> 26:47.730
I can't explain *

26:47.730 --> 26:50.175
* I know Saint Peter

26:47.730 --> 26:50.175
won't call my name *

26:50.175 --> 26:53.779
* Never an honest word *

26:53.779 --> 26:57.250
* That was when

26:53.779 --> 26:57.250
I ruled the world *

26:58.218 --> 27:01.320
[cheers and applause]

27:02.555 --> 27:04.624
- Make some noise!

27:02.555 --> 27:04.624
Keep it going!

27:04.624 --> 27:07.727
[cheers and applause]

27:08.795 --> 27:11.663
Truly stadium status rock

27:08.795 --> 27:11.663
from both of these bands,

27:11.663 --> 27:13.266
this is crazy.

27:13.266 --> 27:14.901
Ester, what a night.

27:13.266 --> 27:14.901
How are you feeling, my love?

27:14.901 --> 27:19.390
- You know what? I thank you.

27:14.901 --> 27:19.390
Both of you guys are giving us

27:19.390 --> 27:21.574
what we've been missing

27:19.390 --> 27:21.574
for almost two years.

27:21.574 --> 27:23.242
We've been wanting

27:21.574 --> 27:23.242
to hear songs.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.644
We wanna see performances,

27:23.242 --> 27:25.644
and tonight,

27:25.644 --> 27:29.249
I see U2 and Coldplay, right?

27:29.249 --> 27:31.384
[cheers and applause]

27:31.384 --> 27:34.721
What I've seen was development

27:31.384 --> 27:34.721
and growth

27:34.721 --> 27:38.223
that made me forget

27:34.721 --> 27:38.223
I was at a cover band show,

27:38.223 --> 27:41.795
and I felt like I'm sweating

27:38.223 --> 27:41.795
in the middle of a stadium,

27:41.795 --> 27:44.730
right,

27:41.795 --> 27:44.730
so thank you for that.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.732
- All you guys, like,

27:44.730 --> 27:46.732
I can really tell

27:46.732 --> 27:49.568
how bad you want this

27:46.732 --> 27:49.568
and how bad you want to win

27:49.568 --> 27:51.604
because you took

27:49.568 --> 27:51.604
all of our notes.

27:51.604 --> 27:55.642
Patrick, those songs

27:51.604 --> 27:55.642
are so hard to sing,

27:55.642 --> 27:57.676
but what I saw when I asked you

27:55.642 --> 27:57.676
to project more,

27:57.676 --> 28:00.130
you came back, and you did it,

27:57.676 --> 28:00.130
and I'm so proud.

28:00.130 --> 28:01.381
As a band, y'all were

28:00.130 --> 28:01.381
having way too much fun.

28:01.381 --> 28:03.249
I loved it.

28:01.381 --> 28:03.249
It was quite the show.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.652
[cheers and applause]

28:05.652 --> 28:07.820
- It was really nice to see

28:05.652 --> 28:07.820
you guys side by side

28:07.820 --> 28:10.824
'cause it helps us compare,

28:07.820 --> 28:10.824
and this is neck and neck.

28:10.824 --> 28:12.592
That was stellar work,

28:12.592 --> 28:14.760
and you guys took the advice

28:12.592 --> 28:14.760
like we asked.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.162
We saw the whole band.

28:16.162 --> 28:19.319
The Edge was, like,

28:16.162 --> 28:19.319
down front playing.

28:19.319 --> 28:21.601
- Yeah.

28:19.319 --> 28:21.601
[cheers and applause]

28:21.601 --> 28:23.690
- Much improved, guys.

28:23.690 --> 28:25.710
This is awesome, like, really

28:23.690 --> 28:25.710
good, really, really good.

28:27.730 --> 28:29.608
- All right, judges. You've got

28:27.730 --> 28:29.608
a lot to consider here.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.243
I mean, everybody brought it.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.679
We're going to be right back

28:31.243 --> 28:32.679
with their decision.

28:32.679 --> 28:33.880
Y'all stay right here.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.682
<i>* *</i>

28:35.682 --> 28:39.152
[cheers and applause]

28:39.152 --> 28:41.453
- This is gonna be tough.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.730
<i>* *</i>

28:50.730 --> 28:53.165
[cheers and applause]

28:53.165 --> 28:56.702
- Welcome back to

28:53.165 --> 28:56.702
"Clash of the Cover Bands."

28:56.702 --> 28:59.873
Now we saw a world-class

28:56.702 --> 28:59.873
stadium rock showdown tonight,

28:59.873 --> 29:03.375
Unforgettable Fire

28:59.873 --> 29:03.375
as U2

29:03.375 --> 29:06.311
versus Fix You:

29:03.375 --> 29:06.311
a Coldplay Tribute.

29:06.311 --> 29:09.883
Now, y'all,

29:06.311 --> 29:09.883
this isn't gonna be easy.

29:09.883 --> 29:12.919
But, judges, it's time

29:09.883 --> 29:12.919
for your verdict.

29:12.919 --> 29:16.890
Which one of these stadium

29:12.919 --> 29:16.890
rockers reigned supreme?

29:17.289 --> 29:19.358
- This is a really

29:17.289 --> 29:19.358
tough decision.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.528
I think when it comes down

29:19.358 --> 29:21.528
to the theme

29:21.528 --> 29:24.798
of stadium rockers,

29:21.528 --> 29:24.798
we have our criteria.

29:24.798 --> 29:26.598
We had to pull that back up.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.667
We had to play by the rules.

29:28.667 --> 29:31.538
And both of you

29:28.667 --> 29:31.538
are at the top of your game.

29:31.538 --> 29:33.239
You play the hell

29:31.538 --> 29:33.239
out of these songs.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.808
You sound great.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.808
You look great.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.811
Coldplay, the vocals,

29:35.808 --> 29:38.811
you really nailed them.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.246
You really dialed them in.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.246
[cheers and applause]

29:40.246 --> 29:43.383
The work with the vocal expert

29:40.246 --> 29:43.383
obviously paid off.

29:43.383 --> 29:44.550
- I know you've got more.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.818
I need to feel

29:44.550 --> 29:45.818
everything you've got.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.288
- All right.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.288
- So right from here.

29:48.288 --> 29:50.289
- The experience so far in

29:48.288 --> 29:50.289
"Clash of the Cover Bands"

29:50.289 --> 29:51.924
has been surreal for us.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.127
- That's fire.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.127
That's it right there.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.596
<i>- I think Kuk just set us</i>

29:55.127 --> 29:56.596
<i>on the right path</i>

29:56.596 --> 29:58.298
<i>to take this home.</i>

29:59.632 --> 30:02.368
- U2, you guys really featured

29:59.632 --> 30:02.368
the whole band.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.703
It wasn't just the Bono show,

30:02.368 --> 30:04.703
which is great.

30:04.703 --> 30:07.773
We saw the entire band

30:04.703 --> 30:07.773
come forward.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.142
- Good, yes, that's it.

30:09.142 --> 30:11.978
- I think working with Ray

30:09.142 --> 30:11.978
has elevated us

30:11.978 --> 30:13.613
because we've been

30:11.978 --> 30:13.613
playing for so long,

30:13.613 --> 30:15.448
and he's given us,

30:13.613 --> 30:15.448
like, a jump-start.

30:15.448 --> 30:16.782
- Now bring it down

30:15.448 --> 30:16.782
like Bono does.

30:16.782 --> 30:19.318
Yes!

30:16.782 --> 30:19.318
<i>- This show means a lot.</i>

30:19.318 --> 30:22.154
<i>We would love</i>

30:19.318 --> 30:22.154
<i>to win this thing.</i>

30:22.154 --> 30:25.991
- You guys took our advice.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.991
We really saw that.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.228
And after all that's said

30:25.991 --> 30:28.228
and done, we have to decide

30:28.228 --> 30:30.864
who our favorite band is.

30:30.864 --> 30:34.334
So the ultimate

30:30.864 --> 30:34.334
cover band tonight is--

30:34.334 --> 30:39.138
<i>- * Did you know that</i>

30:34.334 --> 30:39.138
<i>we were born to fly *</i>

30:41.340 --> 30:42.375
- U2.

30:42.375 --> 30:45.444
<i>- * Rise again *</i>

30:45.444 --> 30:50.416
- Make some noise

30:45.444 --> 30:50.416
for Unforgettable Fire as U2!

30:50.416 --> 30:53.318
Congratulations!

30:50.416 --> 30:53.318
Unforgettable Fire,

30:53.318 --> 30:56.221
you won tonight's

30:53.318 --> 30:56.221
"Clash of the Cover Bands."

30:56.221 --> 30:58.791
Not only are you

30:56.221 --> 30:58.791
$10,000 richer,

30:58.791 --> 31:01.227
but now you are still

30:58.791 --> 31:01.227
in the running

31:01.227 --> 31:04.329
to be crowned

31:01.227 --> 31:04.329
our ultimate cover band.

31:04.329 --> 31:05.898
They'll get to perform live

31:05.898 --> 31:08.233
on "The Tonight Show

31:05.898 --> 31:08.233
Starring Jimmy Fallon."

31:08.233 --> 31:10.700
How are you feeling

31:08.233 --> 31:10.700
right now, man?

31:10.700 --> 31:12.471
- Amazing, it's such

31:10.700 --> 31:12.471
a great feeling.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.972
We've enjoyed ourselves

31:12.471 --> 31:13.972
so much.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.442
Thank you so much.

31:15.442 --> 31:18.779
- Make some noise.

31:15.442 --> 31:18.779
Make some noise.

31:18.779 --> 31:19.878
Thank you so much

31:18.779 --> 31:19.878
to both of these bands

31:19.878 --> 31:23.829
for putting on an incredible

31:19.878 --> 31:23.829
stadium rock show.

31:23.829 --> 31:25.285
U2 and Coldplay would be proud.

31:23.829 --> 31:25.285
I'm just saying.

31:25.285 --> 31:27.554
Thank you, Adam,

31:25.285 --> 31:27.554
Ester and Meghan,

31:27.554 --> 31:31.790
and we will see y'all next time

31:27.554 --> 31:31.790
on "Clash of the Cover Bands."

31:31.790 --> 31:34.693
Deuces!

31:34.693 --> 31:36.528
- That was our first episode.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.528
- Aww, good job!

31:36.528 --> 31:37.997
- Yeah!

31:37.997 --> 31:39.298
- Yeah!

31:39.298 --> 31:43.302
<i>* *</i>

31:45.404 --> 31:49.174
<i>- Next week on "Clash,"</i>

31:45.404 --> 31:49.174
<i>it's all about show stoppers.</i>

31:49.174 --> 31:51.111
<i>- I pay tribute to Cher.</i>

31:51.111 --> 31:52.778
* Find a way *

31:52.778 --> 31:54.213
<i>- On the weekend,</i>

<i>I am the queen of rock</i>

31:54.213 --> 31:58.180
<i>and roll, Tina Turner.</i>

31:58.180 --> 31:59.618
- * Simply the best *

31:59.618 --> 32:01.688
[cheers and applause]

32:01.688 --> 32:03.123
- Short and sweet

32:01.688 --> 32:03.123
are the best things.

32:03.123 --> 32:04.324
- Okay.

32:03.123 --> 32:04.324
- Let's go.

32:04.324 --> 32:05.625
- More attitude is

32:04.324 --> 32:05.625
what you're saying?

32:05.625 --> 32:07.599
- More attitude and conviction.

32:07.599 --> 32:10.329
[cheers and applause]

32:07.599 --> 32:10.329
- And the winner is...
