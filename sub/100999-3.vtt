On your mysterious
Russian ops team who

It's gripping stuff. And
you're suggesting what?

00:21.419 --> 00:24.395
I'm suggesting that a mole's treachery
is getting people killed and

Maybe he said that that to
trigger your empathy. What else?

02:14.641 --> 02:20.449
He said he was with the SVR and had
been funneling information to my uncle.

02:20.517 --> 02:22.720
And there was a senior
CIA officer doing the

02:22.744 --> 02:24.849
exactly the same thing
for the Russians.

02:24.892 --> 02:27.617
- Did he give you a name?
- No.

02:27.642 --> 02:30.086
He give no indication
of who the mole might be?

02:30.087 --> 02:31.391
Nope.

02:33.768 --> 02:36.909
So, why were you watching Piper?

02:36.976 --> 02:40.493
There was a file on Gordon hidden
in Bob Partridge's home office

02:40.519 --> 02:43.534
- What kind of file?
- History on the agency...

02:43.559 --> 02:45.785
financial stuff, surveillance photos,
that sort of things...

02:45.809 --> 02:51.243
- Where is it now?
- I was jumped and someone took it.

02:51.310 --> 02:52.325
Who jumped you?

02:52.326 --> 02:54.769
My first thought was
one of your people.

02:54.811 --> 02:56.387
My people don't operate that way.

Maybe you don't know you
people as well as you think

02:59.019 --> 03:02.161
- Could've been the Russians.
- Or the mole.

03:02.227 --> 03:05.161
- Which will answer our question.
- Which was?

03:05.978 --> 03:08.893
At the funeral Gordon
took an interest in you.

03:08.917 --> 03:11.186
We took an interest in each other.

03:11.229 --> 03:13.304
But, if was Gordon who jumped
you, that

03:13.328 --> 03:15.603
would mean he knew
that you saw the file.

03:15.604 --> 03:18.579
He'd want keep you close,

03:19.313 --> 03:23.996

I've told you everything that I know.

03:24.062 --> 03:26.412
Did Gordon suggest another meeting?

03:29.730 --> 03:32.210
He invited me to brunch, at the church.
But I...

03:32.234 --> 03:33.295
Take him up on that.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.782
I told you, I'm done.

found you outside Piper's house?

me, but obviously

17:30.502 --> 17:32.644
We had a son.

17:34.335 --> 17:36.143
I'm sorry.

17:40.086 --> 17:41.447
I'd better go.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.604
If I give you my number,
will you call me?

17:45.419 --> 17:47.353
Absolutely.

17:49.961 --> 17:52.895
I forgot just how big American
breakfast's are. Oh Jesus...!

17:54.295 --> 17:57.939
Please, don't use the Lord's
name in vain in my house, Joe.

17:59.046 --> 18:00.495
I'm sorry, I didn't...

18:00.519 --> 18:03.712
Jesus fucking Christ,
Joe, lighten up! Relax.

18:03.755 --> 18:05.522
Look what I have.

18:07.088 --> 18:10.230
- Is that Plepler's?
- Yes it is. Mae and Joe brought 'em.

18:10.297 --> 18:15.481
Pastries from Plepler's for the Pipers.
Perfect for absorbing the bloodies!

18:15.506 --> 18:18.356
They're so good.
I just want to smell them.

18:18.424 --> 18:19.883
We need reinforcements, babe.

18:19.907 --> 18:22.465
Could you go the cellar
and get a bottle of Tito's?

18:22.466 --> 18:23.921
I'm not even drinking. Get us...

18:23.922 --> 18:26.649
- (CRASHING)
- Gordon, Gordon!

18:27.507 --> 18:30.690
- Do you have an epipen?
- Should I get it? Yes, I have it

18:30.757 --> 18:35.316
You're having an allergic reaction.
Stay calm, babe. It's gonna be OK

18:40.215 --> 18:44.024
Breathe, Gordon. Breathe...

18:44.091 --> 18:49.149
That's it. There you go.
Just breathe, Gordon.

18:49.216 --> 18:50.821
Are you trying to kill me, Mae?

18:50.845 --> 18:54.258
I swear I asked the bakery and
they said there was no peanuts.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.979
You're OK. It's over now.

18:56.003 --> 18:58.738
You never know where
it's going to come from.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.234
- You're choking me, honey!
- Sorry.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.734
- We should go to the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

19:04.801 --> 19:06.981
Sometimes,
after an allergic reaction...

19:06.982 --> 19:09.920
Trust me... I'm fine.

19:12.093 --> 19:14.890
- You're OK, right, you're OK?
- Yeah.

19:15.678 --> 19:19.652
You just scared the shit out of me.
Don't you do that again, OK.

19:36.430 --> 19:40.905
Was Vasili Sirin
your superior in Moscow?

19:42.263 --> 19:44.821
My group manager.

19:44.888 --> 19:50.489
And you had a relationship
with him outside working hours?

19:50.514 --> 19:52.489
Of a sexual nature?

19:53.597 --> 19:56.031
He forced himself on me.

19:56.098 --> 19:58.739
Do you mean he raped you?

19:59.431 --> 20:04.323
He was my superior.
He took advantage of his position.

20:04.390 --> 20:06.907
Why didn't you report him?

20:09.765 --> 20:14.449
- When did you last meet him?
- It's been years.

20:16.056 --> 20:21.157
Why are you asking these questions?
Has anything happened to him?

20:21.891 --> 20:26.449
What would you feel if
something had happened to him?

20:27.599 --> 20:31.867
Nothing. I have no loyalty to him.

20:33.642 --> 20:37.784
Did he mention his contacts
in the US intelligence service?

20:37.851 --> 20:39.659
No.

20:39.725 --> 20:44.701
- Did he ever mention Bob Partridge?
- No.

20:44.768 --> 20:48.159
Or a man named Joe Turner?

20:49.268 --> 20:52.159
I've seen him on the news once.

20:54.435 --> 20:59.451
If he contacts you, what would you do?

21:00.268 --> 21:02.494
Whatever you order me.

21:05.437 --> 21:10.788
Good good.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.854
(LAUGHING FROM OUTSIDE)

21:38.480 --> 21:40.247
Need something?

21:40.313 --> 21:46.081
- What is that a 42-footer?
- You know your stuff.

21:46.148 --> 21:51.624
When a was a kid, I used to fish
with my dad and Bob.

21:54.481 --> 21:59.707
- Check out this marlin I caught.
- Yeah

21:59.774 --> 22:02.499
Actually someone else caught it.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.583
But everyone who was
there took a picture.

22:08.233 --> 22:12.328
Now this photo hangs in a
hundred different offices,

22:12.352 --> 22:14.983
dens and studies across America.

22:16.525 --> 22:19.123
Has there ever been anything
between you and Joe?

22:19.451 --> 22:22.699
No, he's like my brother.

22:23.151 --> 22:27.543
- He was always kind of a mess.
- It's too bad, he's so cute.

22:28.693 --> 22:32.543
- How are things with Tracy?
- They're good.

22:32.609 --> 22:36.861
If I wanted to be with someone,
I want to be with someone like Tracy.

22:36.885 --> 22:38.402
Yeah, I get that.

22:38.445 --> 22:42.545
- You guys seem good?
- Yeah, I mean. But...

22:42.611 --> 22:44.487
Let's just stick with your love life,

22:44.511 --> 22:48.611
because if I start complaining about
my husband, I might not stop.

22:48.654 --> 22:51.545
Well now I don't feel bad about
trying to kill him earlier.

22:54.987 --> 22:57.840
You know, speaking about
violent impulses, why

22:57.864 --> 23:00.695
did Sammy pour Coke on
Reuel Abbott's shoes?

23:04.321 --> 23:08.671
- Sammy's got a lot of anger.
- Against Reuel Abbott?

23:08.737 --> 23:13.088
He thinks he was involved
in his father's death.

23:13.155 --> 23:14.713
Was he?

23:19.322 --> 23:21.798
Mae? Tell me.

23:24.573 --> 23:28.089
- I shouldn't.
- Mae?

23:29.823 --> 23:33.631
I really haven't talked
about this with anyone.

23:34.740 --> 23:37.060
But ever since I saw how much
Sammy's hurting, I wonder

23:37.084 --> 23:39.364
if I haven't dealt with
everything yet myself.

23:41.948 --> 23:45.716
- Joe and I are going out on the boat.
- Really, right now?

23:45.783 --> 23:50.340
Yeah. Don't you and the kids
have a birthday party today?

23:50.407 --> 23:54.283
Well, It's for me and kids, because
we have so many friends in common.

23:54.307 --> 23:56.107
I just mean we both don't have to go.

23:56.158 --> 23:58.702
Oh perfect!
So why don't you take them and

23:58.726 --> 24:01.074
then Mae and I'll go out on the boat.

24:02.409 --> 24:06.925
- You don't even like the water.
- It doesn't matter.

24:08.742 --> 24:13.426
You can inflict your decisions on me
but you need to spare me the schtick!

24:13.452 --> 24:15.914
You like my schtick.
I'm gonna give you my schtick later.

24:15.938 --> 24:18.159
So, incorrect reading of
the situation right now!

24:18.202 --> 24:19.361
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

24:19.385 --> 24:21.577
Give me one second,
I just have a peanut doughnut.

24:21.619 --> 24:26.427
You know what? You
are the best. Come on.

24:26.453 --> 24:27.886
I'm so sorry.

24:31.454 --> 24:33.554
Tell me.

24:34.704 --> 24:37.136
She's just breaking balls.

24:44.328 --> 24:46.530
She gets sea sick on
the way to the marina.

24:46.623 --> 24:49.759
- Oh yeah? Yeah.
- We're good?

24:52.954 --> 24:58.514
Shit! I forgot my phone.
Sorry, two seconds.

25:02.456 --> 25:05.932
After Sam died, Jude and I were
at home one night watching a movie

25:05.956 --> 25:09.556
and there was a knock on the door.
It was Reuel.

25:10.706 --> 25:13.244
He came and said I had
something that I wasn't

25:13.268 --> 25:15.581
supposed to have
and he wanted it back...

25:16.248 --> 25:18.974
and he threatened me and my family.

25:26.206 --> 25:27.682
What was it?

25:28.458 --> 25:31.934
You know, this is in the past
and I have my family to consider.

25:31.958 --> 25:35.258
I understand, you...
you don't have to tell me..

25:36.792 --> 25:41.267
But I do think you should,
talk to Sidney Thrush.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.366
Senator Sidney Thrush?

25:43.390 --> 25:47.834
She and I got close
through Wounded Warriors.

25:47.877 --> 25:49.994
She was the one who
was spear-heading the

25:50.018 --> 25:52.334
congressional investigation
against Reuel..

25:52.377 --> 25:55.060
When the Frost dossier came out.

26:09.795 --> 26:12.020
- All good.
- Got it?

26:13.170 --> 26:15.036
It's about these
samurai who all become

26:15.060 --> 26:17.211
Ronin after their master
commits harakiri

26:17.254 --> 26:21.186
because he assaulted this guy named
Kira. Except Kira totally had it coming.

26:21.253 --> 26:24.006
But these 47 Ronin
they all become like

26:24.030 --> 26:27.295
alcoholics, or bums,
so nobody suspects shit.

26:27.337 --> 26:30.740
And they wait for over a year
before taking their revenge

26:30.764 --> 26:33.796
and after they kill the
guy, they all commit suicide.

26:33.839 --> 26:37.689
It's fucking dark. What's your point?

26:37.755 --> 26:41.465
You had the right idea about
getting revenge on Reuel Abbott,

26:41.489 --> 26:43.838
you just went about it the wrong way.

26:43.881 --> 26:46.564
So you want me to become
a homeless alcoholic?

26:48.380 --> 26:51.106
Don't thing that'll be necessary.

26:54.673 --> 26:57.064
So what do you think I should do?

27:00.131 --> 27:02.106
Seat belt.

27:03.298 --> 27:05.147
Bye, Jude.

27:05.799 --> 27:09.108
It felt really good to talk
about that, thank you.

27:09.132 --> 27:12.232
Of course,
and I'm calling Sidney tomorrow.

27:14.175 --> 27:16.863
Do me a favor,
just let me think about it.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.049
Yeah, of course.

27:18.091 --> 27:23.109
- Thank you. I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

27:23.176 --> 27:25.985
- Good luck at the birthday party.
- I'll need it!

27:27.134 --> 27:29.735

29:51.604 --> 29:54.287
- Did you say something?
- Yeah. Where are we going?

29:55.020 --> 29:55.997
You're looking a little pale.

29:56.021 --> 29:57.005
I'm fine.

there's nothing to be ashamed of.

I was reaching for the
bourbon and didn't see it.

30:31.316 --> 30:35.499
Oh... Do you want to go back?
Do you want to go to a hospital?

30:36.650 --> 30:40.001
No, we can do it ourselves.

30:43.484 --> 30:47.002
- I need you to push it through.
- What?

30:47.526 --> 30:50.884
It's barbed. You have to push
it through then we cut it.

of a fisherman. His father too.

I could never get the hang of it.

31:39.404 --> 31:42.213
Come on, man, push it! Let's go.

Cut it with that.

32:02.491 --> 32:05.048

remind me of that.

kills the grass, my cousin taught me.

32:57.786 --> 32:59.248
That's your idea of revenge?

32:59.272 --> 33:02.243
It's better than pouring a
Coke on the guy's loafers.

33:02.286 --> 33:05.062
OK, we already established
that wasn't enough

33:05.086 --> 33:07.686
but is this kind of a lateral move,
don't you think

- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

33:11.162 --> 33:14.316
I don't want to be something that
can just wash away or grow back.

33:14.436 --> 33:16.562
I want it to be permanent.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.847
Short of doing that.
I just want to forget about him.

You know, I heard a rumor... that
you're doing a job for the agency.

You've been asking around about me?

33:53.500 --> 33:56.043
Knowing who's around me and
what their motives might

33:56.067 --> 33:58.373
be is just an involuntary
tick at this point.

33:59.583 --> 34:02.349
So, any truth to it?

34:05.082 --> 34:08.976
Fuck the agency. Fuck 'em!

34:10.000 --> 34:12.851
I know, I know how you feel.

34:13.501 --> 34:18.475
They take... talented, caring
people like you and me...

34:18.501 --> 34:25.351
and they use us up.
They poison us. And for what?

34:25.418 --> 34:29.351
Aren't you better off?
We're certainly not better off.

34:29.418 --> 34:32.643
You know I empathize with you brother.

34:33.793 --> 34:35.226
At some point...

34:36.793 --> 34:41.393
a man in this job learns it's all
just a chess match...

34:41.460 --> 34:44.311
and wonders what kind of piece he is.

34:47.212 --> 34:52.186
If you have to ask... you are a pawn.

35:02.545 --> 35:06.522

supposed to do about it?

was going somewhere.

(DOOR CLOSES)

38:25.730 --> 38:29.330
- What are you doing here?
- I have nowhere else to go.

38:29.396 --> 38:33.455
Everyone is looking for you.
You have to leave now.

38:33.522 --> 38:35.998
I just took a lie detector test.

38:38.147 --> 38:41.414
- I...
- Why do you look so sick?

38:42.273 --> 38:43.999
I...

38:53.398 --> 38:55.171
We should do this again

38:55.195 --> 38:58.607
Yeah. Next time with
drinking... and fish.

38:58.608 --> 39:01.022
I'm better at the drinking part.

39:01.046 --> 39:03.107
- Good night!
- Yeah, night!

<i>- Stop... Stop that.
- Come on, Baby.</i>

40:00.530 --> 40:07.504
<i>- Go jerk off on your boat.
- I can't. I fucked up my hand..</i>

40:07.530 --> 40:10.796
- Let him in.
- Okay. Let him in.

40:10.863 --> 40:13.635
<i>My God, what happened?</i>

40:13.659 --> 40:16.655
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

40:21.073 --> 40:25.797
<i>- I just need a kiss.
- Does it make you feel better?</i>

40:29.615 --> 40:31.256
Jesus!

40:31.657 --> 40:36.257
You did well today. Thank you.

40:38.199 --> 40:41.715
What made you decide
to go with him on his boat?

40:42.448 --> 40:46.008
I didn't really feel that I
had much of a choice.

40:46.074 --> 40:48.174
What did you learn?

40:51.992 --> 40:56.175
He's erratic, he's emotional
and he's bad with money.

40:56.242 --> 41:01.508
He is the perfect candidate
for recruitment by a foreign power.

41:02.033 --> 41:06.467
- Make a plan to see him again.
- I'm out of my element.

41:06.534 --> 41:12.635
You're a natural.
You're pushing him, but gently.

41:12.660 --> 41:17.761
"What can a couple guys like
us can do about it?" It was smart.

41:18.537 --> 41:21.135
There's no alarm system on the boat.

41:39.453 --> 41:43.013
I had no idea married
people fucked this often.

41:45.955 --> 41:47.387
I've got to go.

41:47.454 --> 41:53.263
Think about what I said, Joe. The door
is open if you ever wanna feel useful.
