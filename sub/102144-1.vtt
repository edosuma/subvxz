00:08.754 --> 00:13.240
- I know that I've done some
fucked up shit, in my life.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.488
A little petty larceny

Let us in.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.450
Fucking in the office are you, again?

10:55.450 --> 10:56.580
Dirty ringer.

10:58.510 --> 10:59.783
I know you're in there.

11:00.620 --> 11:02.063
- What do you want, Eugene?

11:02.923 --> 11:03.756
- What do you mean, what do I want?

11:03.756 --> 11:05.420
I want you to come to the door

11:05.420 --> 11:08.490
so I can see your fucking
face just for a second like.

11:08.490 --> 11:09.440
- [Bobby] Fuck you.

11:10.683 --> 11:12.280
- That is not very nice.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.440
I'm your fucking neighbor, man.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.150
That's not very hospitable of you, is it?

11:15.150 --> 11:17.520
What if you want some
fucking milk or some sugar?

11:17.520 --> 11:19.070
What are you gonna do then, eh?

11:20.624 --> 11:24.080
I just, I just, I just
want, I need your help, man.

11:24.080 --> 11:24.913
- [Bobby] With what?

11:24.913 --> 11:26.420
- With your computer.
- No.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.220
- I just want to borrow your
computer and your phone,

11:28.220 --> 11:29.320
and I swear to God this time,

11:29.320 --> 11:31.330
it's gonna be just for a fucking second.

11:31.330 --> 11:32.240
- I said hell no.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.600
Last time you borrowed my computer,

11:33.600 --> 11:36.370
you got it fucked up with
all them porno viruses.

11:36.370 --> 11:37.730
Had to go down there and get it fixed

11:37.730 --> 11:38.680
at the computer depot, man.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.664
This shit was almost $80,
you nasty son of a bitch.

11:41.664 --> 11:45.290
- No, no, no, that wasn't fucking me.

11:45.290 --> 11:47.620
I tell you why, because
I was just on my forum

11:47.620 --> 11:49.690
having a quick surf around on the Internet

11:49.690 --> 11:51.320
and then fucking a popup came,

11:51.320 --> 11:53.020
a little quick virus came up.

11:53.020 --> 11:55.330
That had fuck all to do with me, man.

11:55.330 --> 11:57.683
I swear to fucking God it did, nothing.

11:59.861 --> 12:01.640
I'm telling you, you
look at your own history.

12:01.640 --> 12:05.320
Tell me then, tell me then that
that was my fault, you twat.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.683
Just fucking please.

12:10.878 --> 12:13.741
(groans) You fucking cunt, Bobby.

12:13.741 --> 12:14.841
You fucking cunt, man.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.713
Bobby.

12:23.664 --> 12:25.363
(knocking) Oh, Bobby.

12:26.750 --> 12:29.368
Come to the door and just
fucking stick there for a second.

12:29.368 --> 12:32.640
Just stick right there and
I'll be right back, yeah?

12:32.640 --> 12:33.473
- All right.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.640
I just don't know about him, Slappy.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.010
He's a cute little thing.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.980
I just don't know if he
was even born in America.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.820
Listen, when you go to the store later,

12:51.820 --> 12:55.840
I need you to get some
band-aids, some diapers,

12:55.840 --> 12:59.480
some mayonnaise, and a pack
of them little smoky wieners

12:59.480 --> 13:01.830
and some hot dog buns.

13:01.830 --> 13:03.330
I'm gonna try something crazy.

13:04.977 --> 13:07.297
(knocking)

13:07.297 --> 13:09.958
- Woo hoo, still there, Bobby?

13:09.958 --> 13:13.010
- Where else would I be, you
dumb little son of a bitch?

13:13.010 --> 13:15.220
- You're a right pain in
my ass sometimes, mate.

13:15.220 --> 13:16.140
You know what you are?

13:16.140 --> 13:19.040
- Bet you wish I was a pain
in that little ass, don't you?

13:19.996 --> 13:22.817
- [Eugene] Have you been selling
out your meds again, man?

13:22.817 --> 13:25.310
- Why don't you and your
little fuzzy chin come in here?

13:25.310 --> 13:27.403
Let me fuck you like a little queen, boy.

13:28.530 --> 13:29.740
- That's disgusting, man.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.590
That is fucking absolutely
outrageously disgusting.

13:32.590 --> 13:34.710
I've told you umpteen times now

13:34.710 --> 13:37.290
that I like clean pussy
and not hairy assholes.

13:37.290 --> 13:39.723
So listen, stop being gay at me, stop it.

13:43.116 --> 13:46.366
Bobby, are you even watching right now?

13:49.370 --> 13:50.573
Bobby, look.

13:58.690 --> 13:59.523
No.

14:00.678 --> 14:02.770
Fucking hell, your breath stinks, man.

14:02.770 --> 14:03.760
- Bottle me.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.810
- No, give me the computer and phone

14:05.810 --> 14:07.060
and then I'll bottle you.

14:08.940 --> 14:11.238
You've got some eyelashes on your face.

14:11.238 --> 14:12.238
- I need it.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.030
Don't fucking go nowhere.

14:25.997 --> 14:27.720
I want my shit back in 15 fucking minutes.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.710

14:29.710 --> 14:30.800
You'll get it back in an hour.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.676

14:32.676 --> 14:35.053

14:35.980 --> 14:37.780

14:46.510 --> 14:48.430
Stop looking at him.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.630
- Okay, I'll stop.

14:49.630 --> 14:50.998
look at his fucking face--

14:50.998 --> 14:52.570

Um, I am going to be moving to the state,

17:05.150 --> 17:10.150
the town, right here and I've
been promoted with my job.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.100
I've got a promotion.

17:12.100 --> 17:17.100
And I'd like to find a house to live in.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.960
- That's great news.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.150
And let me guess?

17:21.150 --> 17:23.370
You need to buy a home
and you need my help

17:23.370 --> 17:25.804
to find the perfect place for you, right?

17:25.804 --> 17:29.440
- Actually, I'm on your website

17:29.440 --> 17:32.146
and I've actually seen a house

17:32.146 --> 17:35.793
um, that, that I think I'd like to see.

17:36.663 --> 17:38.963
- [Mary] Do you happen
to be online right now?

17:40.110 --> 17:43.100
- Yes, yes, I'm looking at the house,

17:43.100 --> 17:46.180
as we speak, I'm on, and it looks great.

17:46.180 --> 17:50.190
Do you think you'd be able
to show me inside of it?

17:50.190 --> 17:53.890
- Oh God, I'd love to show it to you.

17:53.890 --> 17:56.050
Oh, I'd love to show it to you so bad.

17:56.903 --> 17:59.830
(moaning)

17:59.830 --> 18:02.820
Mr. Spoon, if you look
right under the main photo,

18:02.820 --> 18:04.840
you're gonna see a series
of numbers and letters.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.990
That's our listing ID.

18:05.990 --> 18:08.020
Can you read that out to me, please?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.453
- Yes.

18:09.453 --> 18:10.513
B for Brian,

18:11.362 --> 18:15.520
R, one, three, eight,

18:15.520 --> 18:18.993
G, four, zero, four.

18:20.572 --> 18:23.072
- Okay, give me just a second.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.353
Got it.

18:25.353 --> 18:27.483
Wow, great taste you have, Mr. Spoon.

18:28.683 --> 18:30.170
- Thank you.

18:30.170 --> 18:32.400
- It looks like the
property's still available.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.780
When do you want to look at it?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.705
- How's about one o'clock
tomorrow afternoon?

18:36.705 --> 18:37.788
- Oh, Eugene.

18:38.781 --> 18:41.063
Oh, this is gonna be hard.

18:41.063 --> 18:43.918
(moaning)

18:43.918 --> 18:44.751
Oh, So hard.

18:45.762 --> 18:48.650
I've got a lot of meetings
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.

18:48.650 --> 18:51.053
- Hmm, that's so unfortunate.

18:52.444 --> 18:56.840
I ah, I'm gonna be leaving town tomorrow.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.600
I have to go back home, you see,

18:58.600 --> 19:01.290
and I have to be at the airport,

19:01.290 --> 19:03.130
I've got to be at the airport at,

19:03.130 --> 19:06.044
one second, let me ask my secretary.

19:06.044 --> 19:08.711
(phone beeping)

19:10.820 --> 19:15.820
I have to be there about
4:20 for a 6:25 flight.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.360
So I'm just worried 'cause
it's such a nice house

19:19.360 --> 19:21.180
and I'd really hate to miss out.

19:21.180 --> 19:25.620
And I've got a feeling
that if I don't snap it up,

19:25.620 --> 19:27.703
then it's gonna be gone by
the time I get back. You know?

19:27.703 --> 19:30.023
- Yeah, I see.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.800
Can I place you on hold for just a second?

19:32.800 --> 19:34.310
Let me see what I can do here.

19:34.310 --> 19:36.866
- Okay, thank you, Miss Bender.

19:36.866 --> 19:40.546
(soft cheerful hold music)

19:40.546 --> 19:42.062
You fucking kitten.

19:42.062 --> 19:45.543
I would fucking put it right on you.

19:45.543 --> 19:47.876
(muttering)

19:52.066 --> 19:55.320
(phone rings)

19:55.320 --> 19:57.230
- Mr. Spoon?
- Yes, Mrs. Bender.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.170
- Okay, I've rearranged
a couple of things.

19:59.170 --> 20:01.300
I think I have it worked out for you.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.550
You said one o'clock, correct?

20:02.550 --> 20:03.500
- Yes, one o'clock.

20:04.457 --> 20:06.420
- [Mary] Okay, now if you look right under

20:06.420 --> 20:08.240
that main photo and the listing ID,

20:08.240 --> 20:09.770
you're gonna see the property address.

20:09.770 --> 20:10.670
Do you see it?

20:10.670 --> 20:12.530
- Oh yeah, I see it.

20:12.530 --> 20:13.840
- Wonderful.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.040
Well, looks like it's gonna work out.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.020
And if you don't have any other
questions for me right now,

20:17.020 --> 20:19.830
I'll just plan to see you tomorrow at one.

20:19.830 --> 20:21.313
And Eugene?

20:22.420 --> 20:25.677
I promise, if this house is right for you,

20:26.819 --> 20:30.819
I am gonna do everything
I can to get you in it.

20:36.823 --> 20:41.156
- I would love to get in
it and see it, Mrs. Bender.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.870
- Awesome.

20:42.870 --> 20:44.590
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

20:44.590 --> 20:45.423
- Bye.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.893
Oh yes, Mrs. Bender.

20:52.130 --> 20:53.173
Show it to me.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.423
Open up that door, let me come inside.

20:58.990 --> 21:01.600
Oh yeah, that's right, Mrs. Bender.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.130
Right into the kitchen.

21:03.130 --> 21:06.787
Thank you, yes, yes, you fucking, oh!

21:08.738 --> 21:10.738
(moans)

21:17.780 --> 21:18.690
- [Man] Please omit the rest

21:18.690 --> 21:21.223
of the entertainment and continue.

21:22.220 --> 21:23.830
- [Man] Now, the dance was over.

21:23.830 --> 21:25.920
I stuck my head in the office door

21:25.920 --> 21:28.450
and I saw Clark Robin
and Buck Wing arguing

21:28.450 --> 21:29.650
over by the parrot cage.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.540
- What're they arguing about?
- I don't know,

21:31.540 --> 21:33.921
but Buck Wing was sitting
like a hot tamale.

21:33.921 --> 21:35.710
(coughing)
With a neck like that, see?

21:35.710 --> 21:38.203
And drank some over the other stuff, see?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.503
Then he smacks him on the head like.

21:42.503 --> 21:45.850
Then he says, I'll squeeze the sight

21:45.850 --> 21:47.040
outta your Adam's apple.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.999
Then he gives him the works, like this.

21:48.999 --> 21:51.690
(mumbling)

21:51.690 --> 21:53.063
- Don't you fucking move.

21:54.550 --> 21:55.463
Eugene!

21:57.540 --> 21:58.593
Eugene!

22:00.220 --> 22:02.434
You stuck this bottle
up your ass, didn't you?

22:02.434 --> 22:03.910
You nasty little son of a bitch.

22:03.910 --> 22:06.130
Smells like butt hole.

22:06.130 --> 22:07.430
Well guess what? Fuck you.

22:10.670 --> 22:11.623
I drank it anyway.

22:42.300 --> 22:47.267
(soft music)

23:00.206 --> 23:03.623
(muffled rhythmic music)

23:07.268 --> 23:09.685
(bell dings)

23:10.606 --> 23:12.773
(humming)

23:14.365 --> 23:16.462
- How you doing?

23:16.462 --> 23:19.879
(muffled rhythmic music)

23:21.043 --> 23:23.065
Hey love, want to hear a joke?

23:23.065 --> 23:25.304
You ever had a thumb up your ass?

23:25.304 --> 23:26.204
Hey, hey, come on.

23:27.545 --> 23:29.273
Fuck, I'm only joking.

23:31.801 --> 23:36.801
(humming)
(muffled upbeat music)

23:40.481 --> 23:42.648
Fucking hell, having them.

23:44.260 --> 23:45.093
Good.

23:45.961 --> 23:49.211
(muffled upbeat music)

23:53.019 --> 23:55.186
Jackets, jackets, jackets.

23:59.081 --> 24:00.164
Fucking yeah.

24:01.338 --> 24:04.588
(muffled upbeat music)

24:06.193 --> 24:09.364
Ah man. Fuck.

24:09.364 --> 24:12.697
Bet you regret this now, ain't you, hey?

24:14.962 --> 24:17.758
Yes. (laughs)

24:17.758 --> 24:21.008
(muffled upbeat music)

24:58.339 --> 25:00.973
Oh fuck, go on.

25:02.520 --> 25:03.437
Dirty girl.

25:04.579 --> 25:07.829
(muffled upbeat music)

25:23.488 --> 25:27.905
(mumbling) Yeah, Yeah, Oooh yeah.

25:32.594 --> 25:35.844
(muffled upbeat music)

25:38.639 --> 25:41.056
Swap-a-rooni, that's better.

25:47.616 --> 25:48.974
(muffled hip hop music)

25:48.974 --> 25:52.316
There you go, that and these bad boys.

25:53.577 --> 25:56.994
(muffled hip hop music)

26:17.263 --> 26:18.723
- That's $20 even.

26:22.485 --> 26:23.318
- 20 bucks for these two?

26:24.524 --> 26:25.357
Really?

26:28.046 --> 26:28.879
Fuck.

26:31.866 --> 26:33.283
It's kinda steep.

26:35.663 --> 26:37.341
That's you, isn't it?

26:37.341 --> 26:38.767
What's that say?

26:38.767 --> 26:40.740
Oh yeah, that's you, you're pretty.

26:40.740 --> 26:44.230
Both places, very exotic, I like it.

26:44.230 --> 26:47.240
Shan, Shane, Shaney?

26:47.240 --> 26:50.320
Shannon, shucks, shit.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.923
- Oh my God.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.953
It's pronounced Shaniqua.

27:00.063 --> 27:02.800
- Shan, it's a beautiful, beautiful name.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.950
It's African, isn't it?

27:05.510 --> 27:06.460
Listen, sweetheart.

27:07.550 --> 27:09.560
I've got to be honest with you here.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.390
That's a little more money
than I wanted to spend.

27:12.390 --> 27:15.770
- First off, don't call me sweetheart.

27:15.770 --> 27:20.770
And B, the prices marked on
the labels are as priced.

27:20.810 --> 27:22.075
- Yeah, I know they are.

27:22.075 --> 27:22.908
But you're independent.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.430
You're a strong African-American woman

27:24.430 --> 27:25.900
and I know that you can
make the right decision.

27:25.900 --> 27:28.590
It's not like I'm asking for
a fucking blowjob, is it?

27:28.590 --> 27:30.180
Bending you over the fucking counter,

27:30.180 --> 27:31.686
laying on me.
- Sir, sir.

27:31.686 --> 27:33.140
- Go on.

27:33.140 --> 27:34.792
- You gonna buy this stuff or not?

27:34.792 --> 27:37.464
You're holding up my line.

27:37.464 --> 27:38.920
- You haven't got a fucking line.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.110
Probably have never had a
fucking line in this place.

27:41.110 --> 27:42.790
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

27:42.790 --> 27:45.880
- What did you just say?
- I said you're fucking deaf.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.780
That's what I fucking said, $20 bucks?

27:49.147 --> 27:50.463
$20 fucks.

27:52.435 --> 27:55.160
There, have that.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.880
Fucking daylight you.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.607
You wouldn't know nothing
about daylight, would you?

27:59.966 --> 28:01.049
Fucking cunt.

28:02.867 --> 28:04.782
What are you looking at, wig head, hey?

28:04.782 --> 28:09.781
(soft transcendental music)

28:15.748 --> 28:20.731
(soft transcendental music)

28:37.846 --> 28:42.820
(soft transcendental music)

28:53.417 --> 28:58.409
(soft transcendental music)

29:29.830 --> 29:31.560
Ooh, fucking hell.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.583
(groans) Oooh.

30:18.075 --> 30:20.908
(water trickling)

30:52.556 --> 30:53.389
(water trickling)

31:00.751 --> 31:04.901
(cutting)

31:30.122 --> 31:32.913
(water running)

31:47.082 --> 31:49.315
(water running)

32:16.012 --> 32:21.012
(birds chirping)
(dogs barking)

32:21.141 --> 32:23.391
(foot steps)

32:46.230 --> 32:47.848
- Hey, Mr. Spoon.

32:47.848 --> 32:49.160
Welcome, come on in.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.773
- Oh, just call me Eugene, not Mr. Spoon.

32:52.730 --> 32:54.340
- That's right, I forgot, Eugene.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.480
Did you find it all right?

32:55.480 --> 32:56.560
- I did, thanks, yeah.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.100
Directions were great, thank you.

32:58.100 --> 32:58.933
- Good, perfect.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.168
What did you think of the outside?

33:00.168 --> 33:01.820
- It's all right, yeah.
- Yeah?

33:01.820 --> 33:03.820
- Neighborhood's not my cup
of tea, but you know what?

33:03.820 --> 33:05.288
I live here, I don't live out there.

33:05.288 --> 33:07.928
- (laughs) All right.

33:07.928 --> 33:09.820
You know, you look really familiar.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.250
Have we met before?

33:11.250 --> 33:13.317
- No, I don't think so.

33:13.317 --> 33:15.540
And I would remember you
if I'd have met you before.

33:15.540 --> 33:17.406
You're smashing.

33:17.406 --> 33:18.923
- You're so sweet, thank you.

33:18.923 --> 33:21.080
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.984
So how about I show you
the rest of the house?

33:22.984 --> 33:24.120
- Yeah.

33:24.120 --> 33:24.953
- Yeah?
- Oh yes, please.

33:24.953 --> 33:25.786
That sounds great.

33:25.786 --> 33:27.543
- All right, we'll start with the kitchen.

33:29.470 --> 33:31.650
And here is the recently
renovated kitchen.

33:31.650 --> 33:33.840
It's country French.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.430
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.950
All the appliances are included

33:36.950 --> 33:37.863
in the sale of this home.

33:37.863 --> 33:40.440
- Really?
- Yes, even the fridge.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.720
- Oh wow, that's nice too.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.470
That's a nice one.
- Yeah, I know.

33:44.744 --> 33:46.365
- Yeah, put my beers in there.

33:46.365 --> 33:48.104
- Yeah, you're a beer drinker, huh?

33:48.104 --> 33:49.217
- I love beer.
- Yeah, me too.

33:49.217 --> 33:50.980
Do you do any cooking?

33:50.980 --> 33:52.904
- Well, I do.

33:52.904 --> 33:55.624
I do the cooking for the wife.

33:55.624 --> 33:57.698
Yeah, I take care of her that way.

33:57.698 --> 34:01.106
- Eugene, make me jealous, I love that.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.501
How about we go check out the dining room?

34:02.501 --> 34:04.387
- [Eugene] Oh yeah.

34:04.387 --> 34:06.024
- Love the chandelier.

34:06.024 --> 34:08.688
- Oh wow.
- Great, right?

34:08.688 --> 34:13.688
(low ominous piano music)

34:27.404 --> 34:32.404
(low ominous piano music)

34:48.169 --> 34:50.527
(door close)

34:57.463 --> 35:00.130
(clock ticking)

35:18.905 --> 35:22.946
(groaning)

35:39.272 --> 35:43.830
(groaning)

35:52.919 --> 35:53.752
- Eugene?

35:54.695 --> 35:59.045
Eugene. (laughs)

36:12.611 --> 36:14.861
(mumbling)

36:16.270 --> 36:17.103
Now then.

36:18.150 --> 36:20.775
If you'd be so kind as
to stop moving around

36:20.775 --> 36:24.343
and stop all that screaming, my goodness.

36:25.220 --> 36:27.153
I'd like to speak with
you just for a minute.

36:28.540 --> 36:29.373
Good.

36:30.220 --> 36:33.130
First, I'd like to introduce to you...

36:35.000 --> 36:35.833
The family.

36:37.110 --> 36:39.553
I'm Mr. Bender, James Bender.

36:40.510 --> 36:43.203
Ah, just call me James. (laughs)

36:44.260 --> 36:47.583
Down here at the end is
our star baseball player.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.180
Straight A student and all
around great son, Cody.

36:52.180 --> 36:53.013
- Hi.

36:54.656 --> 36:57.610
- And this little cutie
patootie right next to Cody,

36:57.610 --> 37:01.677
that's Daddy's wittle princess, Emily.

37:01.677 --> 37:02.927
Oh my goodness, how cute.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.623
And last but not least,

37:07.680 --> 37:11.923
uh, my beautiful and loving wife, Mary.

37:13.610 --> 37:14.910
Oh, but you guys have met already.

37:14.910 --> 37:16.830
What am I thinking?

37:16.830 --> 37:17.663
- Eugene.

37:19.590 --> 37:22.380
- The Bender family is
happy to have you here

37:23.350 --> 37:27.003
in our home as our very special guest.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.365
(groaning)

37:36.119 --> 37:38.286
(shushes)

37:41.538 --> 37:44.060
Uh, ooh, hate to do this.

37:44.060 --> 37:44.893
Um, Eugene?

37:45.780 --> 37:47.830
Hate to do this at such a special moment,

37:48.980 --> 37:50.653
but I need to ask you a question.

37:52.330 --> 37:54.840
Mary was showing you
a house earlier today,

37:54.840 --> 37:59.070
but it seemed as if you may
have had other intentions.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.370
Other than buying a house.

38:01.670 --> 38:02.503
Eugene?

38:03.580 --> 38:07.740
Eugene, what was your plan?

38:07.740 --> 38:08.693
Come on.

38:12.230 --> 38:17.230
Mary tells me she thinks
you may have wanted...

38:17.922 --> 38:20.090
Rape her. Hmmm.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.003
Is this true?

38:22.553 --> 38:24.980
(mumbling)

38:24.980 --> 38:27.800
You see, I always look
for the best in people.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.420
All kinds of people, even...

38:31.680 --> 38:34.290
So I'm gonna say...

38:35.458 --> 38:38.125
(clock ticking)

38:47.900 --> 38:49.298
No, no.

38:49.298 --> 38:51.138
(laughs) No way.

38:51.138 --> 38:52.780
(sighs) No, no siree bob.

38:52.780 --> 38:54.950
There is no way you
were gonna hurt my wife.

38:54.950 --> 38:57.490
No way.

38:57.490 --> 38:59.618
It was all just a big misunderstanding.

38:59.618 --> 39:01.900
(sighs) How do you like that?

39:01.900 --> 39:03.680
Yeah? Yeah?
(mumbling)

39:03.680 --> 39:04.680
Can we go with that?

39:05.650 --> 39:08.700
Okay, good.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.300
Eugene, my son's gonna take that

39:10.300 --> 39:13.313
piece of tape off your mouth
so you can agree with me.

39:14.710 --> 39:16.350
Now when Cody takes
that piece of tape off,

39:16.350 --> 39:18.603
it's very simple what I want you to say.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.990
James, I'm so sorry.

39:21.990 --> 39:23.940
It was all just a big misunderstanding.

39:28.380 --> 39:29.530
Can you do that for me?

39:36.860 --> 39:38.540
- Fucking hell, man.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.130
Ouch, fucking hurts.

39:41.130 --> 39:43.300
Sorry James, that was
a big misunderstanding.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.650
I wasn't gonna touch her.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.360
I swear to God, I wasn't.

39:46.360 --> 39:47.440
I was just fucking looking at the house

39:47.440 --> 39:49.575
and I was just gonna buy it.

39:49.575 --> 39:52.270
(mumbling)

39:52.270 --> 39:53.103
- Daddy?

39:54.180 --> 39:56.759
Daddy, Mr. Eugene said the F word.

39:56.759 --> 39:57.914
- I know.

39:57.914 --> 39:59.970
That's a very bad word,
isn't it, sweetheart?

39:59.970 --> 40:00.803
What do you think we should do about

40:00.803 --> 40:02.293
the potty mouth of his?

40:03.315 --> 40:05.820
(laughs) Cody.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.760
Why don't we let your
sister answer this one.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.180
Okay, buddy?

40:09.180 --> 40:10.863
What are you thinking, sweet girl?

40:13.037 --> 40:15.399
- [Emily] (whispers) We should
wash his mouth with soap.

40:15.399 --> 40:18.814
- (laughs) Very good, Emily.

40:18.814 --> 40:21.850
(whistles) Why don't
you go tell Mr. Eugene

40:21.850 --> 40:22.950
what needs to be done?

40:28.578 --> 40:30.514
- (whispers) Think your mouth needs to be

40:30.514 --> 40:32.557
washed out with soap.

40:32.557 --> 40:37.057
(mumbling)
(laughing)

40:49.335 --> 40:50.551
(sighs)
- James.

40:50.551 --> 40:52.030
We really need to set up
for her birthday party.

40:52.030 --> 40:53.530
- Oh my goodness, you're right.

40:53.530 --> 40:55.175
As soon as we deal with
Eugene's dirty mouth,

40:55.175 --> 40:56.935
I will give you a hand with it all.

40:56.935 --> 40:58.473
- Thank you.

40:58.473 --> 41:00.350
- Cod, when we're done here,

41:00.350 --> 41:01.700
I need you to take your
sister upstairs to her room

41:01.700 --> 41:03.200
just for a bit while we set everything up.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.040
Okay?
- Yeah, no problem.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.858
- Great.
- She's gonna be so...

41:05.858 --> 41:08.025
(shushes)

41:10.800 --> 41:11.633
- Ta-da!

41:12.738 --> 41:15.033
(laughs) Very good, good one.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.710
Now Eugene, when my children say something

41:18.710 --> 41:20.350
they're not supposed to say,

41:20.350 --> 41:21.760
they get a bar of soap in their mouth

41:21.760 --> 41:23.870
for three to five minutes.

41:23.870 --> 41:25.750
How bad the word is determines how long

41:25.750 --> 41:26.763
the soap stays in.

41:28.830 --> 41:33.830
Now my children would never,
ever, ever say the F word.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.274
They respect me, their mother,

41:36.274 --> 41:39.100
and themselves, my goodness,

41:39.100 --> 41:41.858
way too much to ever have
that come out of their mouth.

41:41.858 --> 41:44.063
(tutting) Never.

41:47.554 --> 41:49.093
Honestly, Eugene.

41:51.197 --> 41:53.097
I'm a little angry with you right now.

41:54.230 --> 41:56.910
So I'm thinking this bar of soap

41:56.910 --> 41:58.200
should stay in your mouth

41:58.200 --> 42:00.400
until it dissolves completely away.

42:11.130 --> 42:12.223
- You know, Eugene.

42:13.100 --> 42:14.790
Sometimes crazy...

42:16.430 --> 42:17.263
Meets crazy.

42:22.034 --> 42:24.201
(panting)

42:26.994 --> 42:30.244
(soft classical music)

42:32.656 --> 42:34.487
- Why yes, Mr. Pumpkin.

42:35.517 --> 42:37.350
This tea is delicious.

42:41.217 --> 42:42.050
Mmm.

42:44.613 --> 42:46.330
And what do you think, Mr. Bingo?

42:46.330 --> 42:47.713
Are you enjoying your tea?

42:49.335 --> 42:50.168
You are?

42:54.272 --> 42:57.108
And how about you, Mr. Eugene?

42:57.108 --> 42:59.275
Are you enjoying your tea?

43:00.754 --> 43:02.004
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

43:03.255 --> 43:05.505
(mumbling)

43:11.750 --> 43:13.394
I'll be right back.

43:13.394 --> 43:16.644
(soft classical music)

43:27.826 --> 43:28.743
Mr. Eugene?

43:30.760 --> 43:32.720
I'm going to make you even prettier

43:32.720 --> 43:34.073
than you already are.

43:35.568 --> 43:38.818
(soft classical music)

43:43.373 --> 43:44.206
Perfect.

43:45.991 --> 43:48.241
(mumbling)

43:59.212 --> 44:01.462
(cheering)

44:02.893 --> 44:06.226
(cheering and clapping)

44:08.114 --> 44:09.234
- [Cody] Good job, Emily.

44:09.234 --> 44:12.071
(chatting)

44:12.071 --> 44:14.434
- You want it all?
- No, I think it's good.

44:14.434 --> 44:17.111
(laughing)

44:17.111 --> 44:19.278
(moaning)

44:21.373 --> 44:23.623
(laughing)

44:24.666 --> 44:26.140
- Would you care if I threw
up on Eugene right now?

44:26.140 --> 44:27.113
- [Emily] Oh yeah.

44:29.616 --> 44:32.450
- I got the nose, I got
the nose, I got the nose.

44:32.450 --> 44:34.700
(laughing)

44:36.690 --> 44:38.523
Wow, it's really good.

44:40.139 --> 44:41.580
(horn blows)

44:43.047 --> 44:44.487
I completely missed my mouth.

44:44.487 --> 44:45.490
- Oh, want me to get it?

44:45.490 --> 44:46.487
- Yeah, I'm gonna put it here right now.

44:46.487 --> 44:47.544
- He goes, it's not good.

44:47.544 --> 44:52.294
(laughing)
(horn blows)

44:54.692 --> 44:56.626
- [James] That's my little boy.

44:56.626 --> 44:58.865
- All right, stop that.

44:58.865 --> 45:01.115
(laughing)

45:04.023 --> 45:06.166
- Here you go, buddy.

45:06.166 --> 45:07.165
Psyche!

45:07.165 --> 45:09.415
(laughing)

45:12.327 --> 45:13.986
- [Mary] We need to control each other.

45:13.986 --> 45:16.236
(cheering)

45:19.523 --> 45:21.616
- Thanks for being here, buddy boy.

45:22.494 --> 45:26.653
(clock ticking)

45:29.526 --> 45:31.284
(footsteps)

46:36.973 --> 46:41.416
(air horn blast)
(screams)

46:41.416 --> 46:46.375
(ringing)

46:48.914 --> 46:50.956
- Oh my God.

46:50.956 --> 46:53.123
(ringing)

46:55.438 --> 46:57.521
I did that to a cat once.

46:59.059 --> 47:01.392
And it killed him instantly.

47:04.099 --> 47:06.419
I guess you're doing better than the cat.

47:06.419 --> 47:08.586
(ringing)

47:33.890 --> 47:36.743
I say fuck all the time.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.023
Just not to Mom or Dad.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.053
Or little Emily.

47:49.650 --> 47:50.483
Fuck.

47:54.370 --> 47:56.363
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

47:57.590 --> 47:59.570
Fuck, fuck, oh I'm British.

47:59.570 --> 48:01.970
I'm British, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

48:03.518 --> 48:04.351
Fuck!

48:06.316 --> 48:08.740
F-U-C-K, fuck.

48:08.740 --> 48:11.140
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

48:11.140 --> 48:12.023
Fuck!

48:17.313 --> 48:19.738
(dogs barkings)

48:19.738 --> 48:20.899
Thank you.

48:20.899 --> 48:24.270
- [Mary] You're welcome, sweetheart.

48:24.270 --> 48:26.270
- [James] Well good
morning, Bender family.

48:26.270 --> 48:28.761
- Morning, Dad.
- Morning, Daddy.

48:28.761 --> 48:31.710
- (moans) Your mother sure can cook up

48:31.710 --> 48:33.561
some kind of breakfast, can't she?

48:33.561 --> 48:36.238
(moans) Good morning, my beautiful wife.

48:36.238 --> 48:38.405
(moaning)

48:51.530 --> 48:52.363
- James.

48:54.279 --> 48:56.477
(laughing)

48:56.477 --> 48:57.310
Woops.

48:57.310 --> 48:58.600
- Okay, everybody, let's hurry it up.

48:58.600 --> 49:00.523
We're almost to the point of running late.

49:02.900 --> 49:04.383
- Dad?
- Hmm?

49:04.383 --> 49:05.430
What is it, buddy?

49:05.430 --> 49:07.230
- Why are you reading the newspaper?

49:09.700 --> 49:11.700
- What do you mean?

49:11.700 --> 49:13.410
- How could you read a newspaper when

49:13.410 --> 49:14.750
everything that you ever wanted to know

49:14.750 --> 49:16.400
is right here at your fingertips?

49:18.170 --> 49:21.180
- Well son, sometimes your father

49:21.180 --> 49:23.263
likes to kick it old school.

49:23.263 --> 49:25.513
(giggling)

49:27.754 --> 49:28.587
Oh, thank you.

49:28.587 --> 49:30.470
- I like it when you read the newspaper.

49:30.470 --> 49:32.799
There's something sexy about it.

49:32.799 --> 49:34.640
- Ooh, I'll read more.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.473
- That's gross.

49:37.500 --> 49:40.720
Oh and Dad, they canceled
baseball practice today,

49:40.720 --> 49:42.850
so I'll be home early.

49:42.850 --> 49:46.020
- Hmm, make sure you
check on our special guest

49:46.020 --> 49:47.040
when you get home.

49:47.040 --> 49:48.490
Before you start your chores.

49:50.340 --> 49:52.600
And now, speaking of chores,

49:52.600 --> 49:55.500
did you remember to clean off
the back deck the other day?

50:02.940 --> 50:05.919
You didn't sweep off
the back deck, did you?

50:05.919 --> 50:08.010
- No.
- Do your chores, young man.

50:08.010 --> 50:10.638
Do your chores. (laughs)

50:10.638 --> 50:12.380
- Yes, sir.
- My goodness.

50:12.380 --> 50:14.460
- Okay, let's go, let's
go, let's go, kids.

50:14.460 --> 50:16.476
It's time for school.

50:16.476 --> 50:17.309
I love you, sweetie, have a great day.

50:17.309 --> 50:18.570
- [Emily] Love you too, Mommy.

50:18.570 --> 50:19.403
Love you, Daddy.

50:19.403 --> 50:21.679
- Aww, Daddy wuvs his wittle princess.

50:21.679 --> 50:22.512
(puckers)

50:22.512 --> 50:23.620
- I love you too, Cody, have a good one.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.037
- Bye Mom, love you too.

50:25.037 --> 50:25.903
And Dad?

50:26.950 --> 50:27.783
It's way cooler.

50:28.920 --> 50:29.820
- Have a good day.

50:30.740 --> 50:33.759
- [Cody] And what was I
supposed to clean when I--

50:33.759 --> 50:35.509
- Ooh, I oughta, huh?

50:37.050 --> 50:38.620
- You two are a mess.

50:38.620 --> 50:39.660
All right, I'm headed to work.

50:39.660 --> 50:41.940
Are you gonna check on our
special guest before you leave?

50:41.940 --> 50:43.130
- Just for you.

50:43.130 --> 50:45.040
- Good, hey, don't forget
about tonight, okay?

50:45.040 --> 50:46.210
It's family dinner night.

50:46.210 --> 50:47.420
- Hmm, looking forward to it.

50:47.420 --> 50:49.190
- Good, also don't forget.

50:49.190 --> 50:51.260
Susan is coming to pick
Emily up after dinner.

50:51.260 --> 50:52.857
She's gonna spend the night.

50:52.857 --> 50:54.115
- That I did not know.

50:54.115 --> 50:56.180
- [Mary] That's what you have me for.

50:56.180 --> 50:57.470
I gotta go, I love you.

50:57.470 --> 50:58.890
- I love you more.

50:58.890 --> 51:01.320
- [Mary] No, that's impossible.

51:15.156 --> 51:17.073
- Good morning, Eugene.

51:18.130 --> 51:19.636
Did I wake you?

51:19.636 --> 51:21.053
Wakey-wakey, hmm?

51:22.812 --> 51:23.762
Did you sleep well?

51:24.930 --> 51:29.930
I brought you some
scrambled eggs and some OJ.

51:29.990 --> 51:32.480
Everyone has to start their
day off with a good breakfast.

51:32.480 --> 51:33.313
I insist.

51:37.400 --> 51:39.823
Let's get this started, shall we?

51:41.054 --> 51:42.596
- Where the fuck am I?
- Oh I know, I know,

51:42.596 --> 51:44.080
I know, I know. (shushes)

51:44.080 --> 51:44.913
Listen.

51:45.839 --> 51:47.810
(sighs)

51:47.810 --> 51:49.290
I just don't have time to listen

51:49.290 --> 51:51.210
to all your problems right now.

51:51.210 --> 51:54.360
So let me tell you how
this is gonna work, okay?

51:54.360 --> 51:55.840
I'm gonna take that piece of tape

51:55.840 --> 51:57.660
right off your mouth again, and this time,

51:57.660 --> 52:00.910
you're not gonna say anything.

52:00.910 --> 52:02.310
And I'm gonna give you some of those

52:02.310 --> 52:04.940
delicious and fluffy scrambled eggs

52:04.940 --> 52:08.820
that my wife made specially for you.

52:08.820 --> 52:10.000
And then I'm gonna let you wash it down

52:10.000 --> 52:11.530
with some freshly squeezed OJ.

52:11.530 --> 52:12.690
How does that sound?

52:12.690 --> 52:14.500
Huh, yeah?

52:14.500 --> 52:18.290
Now, if you don't need
anything to eat or drink then,

52:18.290 --> 52:20.990
well, by all means, say whatever you like.

52:20.990 --> 52:22.550
But know this.

52:22.550 --> 52:24.610
Know this, I'm just gonna
put that piece of tape

52:24.610 --> 52:26.015
right back on your mouth

52:26.015 --> 52:28.765
and you're not gonna get
anything to eat for breakfast.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.733
Do you understand me, Eugene?

52:32.820 --> 52:33.913
Good, good.

52:34.756 --> 52:35.817
You want to try it again?

52:35.817 --> 52:38.415
Yeah, let's try it again.

52:38.415 --> 52:39.248
Now when Emily was a little girl,

52:39.248 --> 52:41.040
she was very finicky too.

52:41.040 --> 52:44.033
And I had to make believe
food was an airplane.

52:45.150 --> 52:46.900
And it was coming in for a landing.

52:50.575 --> 52:52.103
What do you say we play that game too?

52:54.200 --> 52:56.043
Let's see that runway, shall we?

52:58.537 --> 53:00.873
- Wasn't gonna touch her.
- The airport is open.

53:02.020 --> 53:05.130
Ooh, you got a wittle mouth.

53:05.130 --> 53:06.263
Like a tunnel.

53:07.270 --> 53:08.750
I have an idea.

53:08.750 --> 53:13.750
Let's make believe the airplane
is now a choo choo train.

53:14.420 --> 53:16.060
Choo choo train.

53:16.060 --> 53:18.556
Ready to put the train in the tunnel?

53:18.556 --> 53:19.973
Here we go.

53:21.439 --> 53:22.689
Chugga, chugga,

53:24.276 --> 53:26.137
chugga, chugga,

53:26.137 --> 53:27.135
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,

53:27.135 --> 53:28.137
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,

53:28.137 --> 53:29.135
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,

53:29.135 --> 53:31.839
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, choo choo!

53:31.839 --> 53:34.460
(laughs) Good, let's try it again, ready?

53:34.460 --> 53:38.196
Backing up. (beeping)

53:38.196 --> 53:39.246
- Fucking loony, man.

53:41.754 --> 53:44.095
- Here comes the train,
coming around the bend.

53:44.095 --> 53:45.345
Chugga, chugga,

53:46.457 --> 53:47.636
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,

53:47.636 --> 53:49.097
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,

53:49.097 --> 53:50.133
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,

53:50.133 --> 53:51.133
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,

53:51.133 --> 53:53.394
choo, choo!
- Fucking twat.

53:53.394 --> 53:54.836
- That was great.

53:54.836 --> 53:56.470
(gasps) I know what you need.

53:56.470 --> 53:58.380
OJ!

53:58.380 --> 54:01.070
Let's wash it down with some orange juice.

54:01.070 --> 54:02.940
Emily used to call it awwange juice.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.560
Want some awwange juice?

54:04.560 --> 54:07.150
It's good, it's fweshly
squeezed awwange juice.

54:07.150 --> 54:10.150
Take a big sip, wash down those eggs.

54:10.150 --> 54:12.516
Good boy, that's a good boy.

54:12.516 --> 54:15.199
Take even a bigger sip.

54:15.199 --> 54:17.390
Ooh there you, oh, don't gulp, don't gulp.

54:17.390 --> 54:19.130
Don't gulp, you'll get the hiccups.

54:19.130 --> 54:20.383
Good, good, good, good.

54:22.617 --> 54:23.780
And just because of that good behavior,

54:23.780 --> 54:26.394
do you know what you get, huh?

54:26.394 --> 54:27.430
Do you want to guess?

54:27.430 --> 54:28.353
Take a big guess.

54:30.670 --> 54:31.999
Hmm?

54:31.999 --> 54:33.810
Hmm?

54:33.810 --> 54:37.333
You get to watch TV all day long, yay!

54:38.559 --> 54:39.559
Hello, are you home?

54:40.735 --> 54:41.568
Sad, I know.

54:43.354 --> 54:44.377
Let's see.

54:44.377 --> 54:46.770
Oh, don't worry, it works.

54:46.770 --> 54:49.330
Kind of. (laughs)

54:49.330 --> 54:52.380
There it is, ta-da!

54:52.380 --> 54:53.213
Hmm? Hmm?

54:55.555 --> 54:57.135
Did you want to say something?

54:57.135 --> 54:59.973
- [Eugene] Fuck you.

55:01.640 --> 55:02.473
Piece of shit.

55:14.830 --> 55:16.920
- I'm not gonna get my
nice clothes all messed up

55:16.920 --> 55:20.063
just because of your
rudeness and bad behavior.

55:26.530 --> 55:29.000
Guess that makes you a lucky man for now.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.850
Put 'em up. (laughs)

55:31.850 --> 55:33.350
Some of us have to go to work.

55:37.720 --> 55:38.553
Oh my goodness.

55:40.460 --> 55:43.420
You don't know anything
about that, now do you?

55:43.420 --> 55:46.513
Eugene, work is what responsible
members of society do.

55:48.799 --> 55:51.120
Eugene, you're a mess. (laughs)

55:51.120 --> 55:52.083
Oh my goodness.

55:52.996 --> 55:55.053
And on top of that, no one,

55:56.890 --> 55:57.723
no one

55:59.960 --> 56:01.543
is looking for you.

56:03.570 --> 56:04.403
No one.

56:06.270 --> 56:07.103
See?

56:08.240 --> 56:09.700
I'm trying to be the good guy here

56:09.700 --> 56:11.313
but you just won't let me do it.

56:14.239 --> 56:15.072
I guess...

56:17.077 --> 56:19.030
I'm really gonna have to show you

56:20.053 --> 56:22.953
that this kind of bad behavior
will not be tolerated, hmm?

56:25.060 --> 56:25.893
Eugene.

56:26.790 --> 56:27.730
I'll deal with you when I get home

56:27.730 --> 56:29.733
later this evening, young man.

56:29.733 --> 56:30.566
Got your nose.

56:48.389 --> 56:51.139
(birds chirping)

57:19.480 --> 57:23.019
- Don't forget, Daddy said you
need to clean the back deck.

57:23.019 --> 57:26.379
- No, Daddy said you need
to clean the back deck.

57:26.379 --> 57:28.473
- Uh-uh, he said you.

57:29.977 --> 57:32.644
(clock ticking)

58:08.650 --> 58:09.483
(cheers)

58:24.725 --> 58:25.558
Crack!

58:25.558 --> 58:26.943
(screaming)

58:28.629 --> 58:29.629
- Oh my God.

58:30.826 --> 58:33.728
I think I heard something crack.

58:33.728 --> 58:36.260
(whimpering)

58:36.260 --> 58:38.208
And it wasn't the bat.

58:38.208 --> 58:40.629
- [Eugene] I'm gonna fucking kill you.

58:40.629 --> 58:43.046
(whimpering)

58:49.910 --> 58:50.743
- You know?

58:53.110 --> 58:54.140
Dad says

58:55.648 --> 58:58.023
real men don't cry.

58:58.869 --> 59:01.286
(whimpering)

59:03.880 --> 59:04.883
Dad's right again.

59:06.503 --> 59:08.920
(whimpering)

59:19.888 --> 59:20.721
- Where are the kids?

59:20.721 --> 59:22.448
- In their rooms doing homework.

59:22.448 --> 59:23.970
- Aww.

59:23.970 --> 59:25.568
Something's starting
to smell good in here.

59:25.568 --> 59:27.400
- Thank you.
- What we having tonight?

59:27.400 --> 59:29.900
- Tonight on the Bender family menu,

59:29.900 --> 59:31.625
we're gonna have my
homemade veggie lasagna

59:31.625 --> 59:33.986
and all of our favorite sides.

59:33.986 --> 59:35.930
- Mmm, that sounds amazing.

59:35.930 --> 59:37.488
- Should be.

59:37.488 --> 59:39.269
- What are you thinking, an hour?

59:39.269 --> 59:40.997
Just a little longer?

59:40.997 --> 59:43.370
- [Mary] We can say an
hour and a half to be safe.

59:43.370 --> 59:44.203
- Perfect.

59:45.290 --> 59:47.790
That gives me time to play with Eugene

59:49.269 --> 59:51.750
and grab a little shower
before we sit down for dinner.

59:51.750 --> 59:53.653
- [Mary] How is our special guest doing?

59:55.100 --> 59:56.729
- He's doing.

59:56.729 --> 59:57.917
- [Mary] Play nicely.

1:00:03.003 --> 1:00:05.670
(ice crumbling)

1:00:16.550 --> 1:00:18.143
- Eugene, hey.

1:00:19.090 --> 1:00:20.310
Hey, Cody told me he showed you

1:00:20.310 --> 1:00:22.040
how well he could swing a bat.

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:22.873
Is that true?

1:00:28.068 --> 1:00:29.493
(laughs)

1:00:29.493 --> 1:00:30.880
Oh my goodness.

1:00:31.780 --> 1:00:34.063
He really did a number
on you, now, didn't he?

1:00:35.090 --> 1:00:36.690
Boy's got some power
behind that swing of his.

1:00:36.690 --> 1:00:37.573
Don't you think?

1:00:41.100 --> 1:00:43.093
You remember this morning, yeah?

1:00:44.070 --> 1:00:45.970
Bet you're gonna wish you
had that to do all over again

1:00:45.970 --> 1:00:47.470
by the time I'm done with you.

1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:51.433
John Wayne Gacy.

1:00:52.870 --> 1:00:55.500
Served 16 months for assault,

1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:58.240
then returned to his hometown to begin

1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:01.353
what appeared to be a quiet, normal life.

1:01:02.704 --> 1:01:04.440
In December of '78,

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:06.440
a search of Mr. Gacy's home revealed

1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:08.190
what that young man had been up to.

1:01:09.088 --> 1:01:11.910
The man who would become
known as the Killer Clown,

1:01:11.910 --> 1:01:14.770
who had a hobby of
entertaining young children

1:01:14.770 --> 1:01:16.400
dressed as a clown, ugh,

1:01:17.490 --> 1:01:22.490
had killed a staggering
33 young men and boys.

1:01:24.810 --> 1:01:28.460
Picked up runaways and
even some male prostitutes.

1:01:28.460 --> 1:01:31.840
He handcuffed them and choked them

1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:34.544
while he sexually assaulted them.

1:01:34.544 --> 1:01:36.794
(groaning)

1:01:41.956 --> 1:01:44.297
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1:01:45.670 --> 1:01:49.488
Hmm, Ed Gein.

1:01:49.488 --> 1:01:50.321
Ed Gein.

1:01:52.165 --> 1:01:52.998
Ed Gein.

1:01:54.384 --> 1:01:55.790
There we go.

1:01:55.790 --> 1:01:57.140
We'll probably never know

1:01:57.140 --> 1:01:59.460
the total number of his victims.

1:01:59.460 --> 1:02:01.830
He confessed to two murders.

1:02:01.830 --> 1:02:04.970
Exactly, highly suspected
to be more than that.

1:02:06.165 --> 1:02:08.368
Ugh, when the police
raided his farm house,

1:02:08.368 --> 1:02:11.040
(whistles and laughs)

1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:14.113
they discovered a house of horrors.

1:02:15.410 --> 1:02:19.770
Body parts from dozens of women
just scattered everywhere.

1:02:19.770 --> 1:02:23.220
And on top of the murders,
dabbled in grave robbing.

1:02:23.220 --> 1:02:25.690
Had a preference for the ladies' bodies.

1:02:25.690 --> 1:02:29.282
One of the graves, ugh, was his mother.

1:02:29.282 --> 1:02:31.532
(groaning)

1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:35.013
Jeffrey Dahmer.

1:02:36.210 --> 1:02:38.181
The Dahminator!

1:02:38.181 --> 1:02:39.660
I made that up.

1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:44.510
Sexually abused and
murdered young men and boys.

1:02:44.510 --> 1:02:46.270
He also dismembered,

1:02:46.270 --> 1:02:48.928
engaged in necrophilia,

1:02:48.928 --> 1:02:53.110
(groans) and cannibalized
many of his victims

1:02:53.110 --> 1:02:55.104
right in his own apartment.

1:02:55.104 --> 1:02:57.354
(groaning)

1:03:00.100 --> 1:03:01.283
Ted Bundy.

1:03:02.370 --> 1:03:05.065
Not to be confused with
my two favorite Bundys,

1:03:05.065 --> 1:03:06.910
Al and King Kong.

1:03:06.910 --> 1:03:08.725
Five!

1:03:08.725 --> 1:03:09.870
Ow. (chuckles)

1:03:09.870 --> 1:03:11.240
Not a wrestling fan, huh?

1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:13.500
You keep disappointing me, Eugene.

1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:17.640
Ted had four or five years
of persistent killings.

1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:19.420
Beat, raped, and strangled,

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:22.033
ooh, 35 plus.

1:03:23.082 --> 1:03:25.780
Many of his victims were students from

1:03:25.780 --> 1:03:28.005
a number of universities.

1:03:28.005 --> 1:03:30.255
(groaning)

1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:33.610
Stay with me, Eugene.

1:03:33.610 --> 1:03:35.040
Eugene? (whistles)

1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:37.380
Hey, (claps) stay with me.

1:03:37.380 --> 1:03:39.410
Henry Lee Lucas.

1:03:39.410 --> 1:03:41.663
Had a 20 year crime spree.

1:03:42.610 --> 1:03:44.940
It's been said he's responsible

1:03:44.940 --> 1:03:48.202
for as many as 600 murders.

1:03:48.202 --> 1:03:49.035
(warbles)

1:03:49.035 --> 1:03:50.100
I mean, great googly-moogly.

1:03:50.100 --> 1:03:52.810
Who has the time for
something like that, right?

1:03:52.810 --> 1:03:55.870
Unfortunately, a police
task force reports that

1:03:55.870 --> 1:04:00.341
number's probably somewhere
closer to around 350.

1:04:00.341 --> 1:04:02.591
(groaning)

1:04:05.100 --> 1:04:07.883
And then there's Charles Manson.

1:04:09.525 --> 1:04:11.158
Ugh, now you see,

1:04:11.158 --> 1:04:13.770
this just isn't fair.

1:04:13.770 --> 1:04:18.770
Manson in prison and he never,
ever, ever killed anyone.

1:04:20.190 --> 1:04:21.690
Go ahead, look it up yourself.

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:27.424
It is truly an American
tragedy, what they did to him.

1:04:27.424 --> 1:04:29.674
(groaning)

1:04:41.833 --> 1:04:43.833
(sighs)

1:04:45.283 --> 1:04:47.533
(groaning)

1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:57.673
So you see, Eugene.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.473
Life just isn't fair.

1:05:03.070 --> 1:05:05.803
Some people have it, some people don't.

1:05:08.230 --> 1:05:10.633
We are the Bender family.

1:05:13.490 --> 1:05:14.990
And people will know our name.

1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:19.710
And they will know our history.

1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:23.683
Unfortunately, Eugene,

1:05:26.270 --> 1:05:28.520
you won't be one to help
spread that history.

1:05:29.910 --> 1:05:31.570
Our true legacy that

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:34.713
has been set in the past,

1:05:35.690 --> 1:05:38.203
continues to be set now,

1:05:39.460 --> 1:05:43.333
and as you've witnessed,
will continue in the future.

1:05:46.340 --> 1:05:49.923
Eugene, you won't make
it out of this alive.

1:05:52.830 --> 1:05:54.253
You are just a victim.

1:05:56.480 --> 1:05:57.780
And we thank you for that.

1:06:02.563 --> 1:06:03.863
What is that smell?

1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:09.190
My God, did you urinate yourself?

1:06:09.190 --> 1:06:11.133
My God, you did.

1:06:13.161 --> 1:06:14.613
Well, there's no need for that.

1:06:17.257 --> 1:06:19.340
(scoffs)

1:06:20.370 --> 1:06:21.203
Well, this has to be
embarrassing for you, huh?

1:06:32.787 --> 1:06:34.357
(classical piano)

1:06:34.357 --> 1:06:36.607
(laughing)

1:06:39.050 --> 1:06:41.902
The body is very
resilient, very resilient.

1:06:41.902 --> 1:06:44.152
(laughing)

1:06:45.710 --> 1:06:48.025
Gonna sprinkle this with
some Ebola seasoning.

1:06:48.025 --> 1:06:50.275
(laughing)

1:06:53.510 --> 1:06:56.233
I got a big surprise for you.

1:06:57.310 --> 1:06:58.910
But I can't tell you what it is 'til

1:06:58.910 --> 1:07:01.023
I trim those fingernails of yours.

1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:04.093
Look, see?

1:07:05.430 --> 1:07:07.130
Look how nicely those are kept up.

1:07:09.022 --> 1:07:11.123
I think we can all agree.

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:14.560
That was an incredible meal.

1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:16.361
Thank you, beautiful.

1:07:16.361 --> 1:07:17.764
- Dessert?

1:07:17.764 --> 1:07:18.733
(laughing)

1:07:18.733 --> 1:07:20.643
- None for me, I am stuffed.

1:07:22.910 --> 1:07:23.883
That's better.

1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:40.530
You ready?

1:07:40.530 --> 1:07:41.910
Tell you what.

1:07:41.910 --> 1:07:44.500
Maybe a little glass of
wine later on though, huh?

1:07:44.500 --> 1:07:45.903
- Now, that sounds nice.

1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:48.300
- Ice cream?

1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:50.230
- Emily, sweetie, do you have
all your things ready to go?

1:07:50.230 --> 1:07:52.330
Miss Susan will be here
shortly to pick you up.

1:07:52.330 --> 1:07:55.230
- Yep, everything is packed
and sitting by the front door.

1:08:01.545 --> 1:08:05.128
(screaming and whimpering)

1:08:14.562 --> 1:08:17.145
- I gotta go.
- Whoa, young man.

1:08:19.881 --> 1:08:20.714
You have fun tonight.

1:08:20.714 --> 1:08:22.640
Behave yourself.
- Yes, sir.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.561
- I love you, Cody.
- Love you too, Mom.

1:08:25.561 --> 1:08:29.144
(whimpering and screaming)

1:08:32.070 --> 1:08:35.060
- Emily, sweetheart, you have
time to do one of two things.

1:08:35.060 --> 1:08:36.730
You can either have ice cream

1:08:36.730 --> 1:08:38.683
or say your goodbyes to Mr. Eugene.

1:08:40.185 --> 1:08:42.602
(whimpering)

1:08:45.980 --> 1:08:47.444
- Mr. Eugene.

1:08:47.444 --> 1:08:49.630
(sobbing)

1:08:49.630 --> 1:08:51.840
- Head to the basement to
say your goodbyes then.

1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:52.707
- Last one.

1:08:55.102 --> 1:08:55.935
(groans)

1:08:55.935 --> 1:08:56.768
All done!

1:08:57.924 --> 1:08:59.843
We are so lucky to have that little angel.

1:09:01.044 --> 1:09:02.360
- I know.

1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:03.710
She takes after her mother.

1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:06.180
- Let me get some band-aids

1:09:06.180 --> 1:09:07.680
and clean this little mess up.

1:09:09.961 --> 1:09:12.128
(panting)

1:09:24.723 --> 1:09:25.723
There we go.

1:09:27.861 --> 1:09:29.260
There we go.

1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:32.873
Now you are ready for your surprise.

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.820
Let me ask you something first though.

1:09:37.684 --> 1:09:39.470
And this is just between us, right?

1:09:39.470 --> 1:09:41.103
Man to man, yeah?

1:09:43.350 --> 1:09:45.000
You think my wife is sexy, right?

1:09:48.780 --> 1:09:49.713
Yeah, she is.

1:09:50.900 --> 1:09:53.600
You think it'd be amazing
to have sex with her, right?

1:09:54.446 --> 1:09:57.323
Well yeah, I mean, duh, it is.

1:09:58.780 --> 1:10:01.110
Eugene, my wife

1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:04.393
is very special to me.

1:10:05.630 --> 1:10:08.163
I love her so much.

1:10:10.090 --> 1:10:11.937
I would and have

1:10:13.650 --> 1:10:15.143
done anything for her.

1:10:17.270 --> 1:10:18.421
Now with all that being said,

1:10:18.421 --> 1:10:20.628
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1:10:20.628 --> 1:10:22.920
we're both guys, men.

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:25.593
We both lust over the female body, right?

1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.500
Well. (chuckles)

1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:33.500
Eugene, consider this
a gift from me to you.

1:10:34.948 --> 1:10:36.365
Enjoy, my friend.

1:10:37.406 --> 1:10:40.156
(camera buzzing)

1:10:41.966 --> 1:10:45.299
(Rumba music)

1:10:57.983 --> 1:11:01.783
(Rumba music)

1:11:36.405 --> 1:11:40.063
(Rumba music)

1:12:28.102 --> 1:12:31.435
(Rumba music)

1:13:34.611 --> 1:13:38.289
(soft classical music)

1:13:38.289 --> 1:13:41.072
(clock ticking

1:13:43.470 --> 1:13:44.303
My dear.

1:13:46.451 --> 1:13:48.868
You are as beautiful as ever.

1:13:51.548 --> 1:13:53.187
And I raise my glass to you.

1:13:54.633 --> 1:13:57.883
(soft classical music)

1:14:00.822 --> 1:14:04.405
(clocking ticking)

1:14:14.117 --> 1:14:16.284
- And I raise mine to you.

1:14:18.454 --> 1:14:20.047
I love you.

1:14:20.047 --> 1:14:21.143
You are my life.

1:14:22.875 --> 1:14:26.798
(soft classical music)

1:14:26.798 --> 1:14:30.098
(clock ticking)

1:14:43.230 --> 1:14:44.683
- And you are my life.

1:14:47.110 --> 1:14:47.943
So.

1:14:49.070 --> 1:14:50.103
My life.

1:14:51.780 --> 1:14:53.580
What are your thoughts on our guest?

1:14:55.650 --> 1:14:58.150
What do you think his true
intentions really were?

1:14:59.182 --> 1:15:02.747
(soft classical music)

1:15:02.747 --> 1:15:05.505
(clock ticking)

1:15:22.950 --> 1:15:25.533
- I think he wanted to fuck me.

1:15:26.433 --> 1:15:28.600
(moaning)

1:16:03.941 --> 1:16:08.908
(clock ticking)

1:17:14.225 --> 1:17:18.591
(clock ticking)

1:17:46.700 --> 1:17:49.283
(tape ripping)

1:18:48.751 --> 1:18:51.418
(clock ticking)

1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:58.740
(limping footsteps)

1:19:12.223 --> 1:19:15.714
(clock ticking)

1:20:24.792 --> 1:20:25.625
- Wake up.

1:20:28.791 --> 1:20:29.624
Wake up.

1:20:33.768 --> 1:20:37.268
I said, wake the fuck up, you fuck sticks.

1:20:42.211 --> 1:20:43.211
Remember me?

1:20:46.872 --> 1:20:50.233
And I know that I'm fucked up, okay?

1:20:51.090 --> 1:20:51.953
But you two.

1:20:54.123 --> 1:20:56.980
You people and this fucking family,

1:20:56.980 --> 1:20:59.010
whatever the fuck it is.

1:20:59.010 --> 1:21:00.273
Those children?

1:21:01.350 --> 1:21:03.713
You've seriously lost a fucking block.

1:21:06.910 --> 1:21:08.410
What are you, hey?

1:21:10.930 --> 1:21:12.097
What the fuck?

1:21:14.051 --> 1:21:16.273
And you, Mr. fucking history lesson.

1:21:17.300 --> 1:21:19.130
What the fuck?

1:21:19.130 --> 1:21:20.380
Who do you think you are?

1:21:25.427 --> 1:21:28.793
I know that I've done some
fucked up shit in my life.

1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:32.750
I little petty larceny,
some fucking burglars.

1:21:32.750 --> 1:21:34.783
A little rape but not really.

1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:36.793
But you.

1:21:38.330 --> 1:21:40.223
Killing the both of you two tonight.

1:21:41.470 --> 1:21:43.310
And I'm gonna be up walking
to that fucking place

1:21:43.310 --> 1:21:46.253
up on high with my head fucking level.

1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:50.115
Because you know what?

1:21:50.115 --> 1:21:51.780
There's some shit in this world

1:21:51.780 --> 1:21:54.755
and then there's some
fucked up shit in it.

1:21:54.755 --> 1:21:58.587
And you two, you're fucking nuts, man.

1:21:59.647 --> 1:22:00.730
Both of yous.

1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:05.410
I'm gonna do this world
some justice tonight.

1:22:07.130 --> 1:22:10.120
Right here, right fucking now,

1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:11.613
in front of the both of you.

1:22:14.670 --> 1:22:15.813
I'm the law.

1:22:17.060 --> 1:22:19.920
I'm the judge and the fucking jury.

1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:22.549
I am your fucking executioner.

1:22:22.549 --> 1:22:24.851
I am your fucking God.

1:22:24.851 --> 1:22:27.601
(gunshot blast)

1:22:29.054 --> 1:22:31.804
(heart pounding)

1:22:41.893 --> 1:22:44.576
(heart pounding)

1:23:09.111 --> 1:23:12.728
(heart pounding)

1:23:27.773 --> 1:23:31.114
(heart pounding)

1:24:45.168 --> 1:24:48.109
(heart stops pounding)

1:25:17.830 --> 1:25:20.497
(phone ringing)

1:25:27.514 --> 1:25:28.440
- [Mary] Hello, this is Mary Bender.

1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:29.930
How may I help you?

1:25:29.930 --> 1:25:31.460
- [Mr. Adams] Hey Mary, this is Mr. Adams.

1:25:31.460 --> 1:25:32.618
How you doing?

1:25:32.618 --> 1:25:35.240
- [Mary] I'm great, Mr.
Adams, how about yourself?

1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:36.490
- [Mr. Adams] Hey, I'm doing really well.

1:25:36.490 --> 1:25:39.850
I wanted to take a look
at the office space again.

1:25:39.850 --> 1:25:41.740
- [Mary] Great, I have
some time later today.

1:25:41.740 --> 1:25:43.213
Would that work for you?

1:25:43.213 --> 1:25:45.900
- [Mr. Adams] Yeah, let me look.

1:25:45.900 --> 1:25:47.810
It looks great, this afternoon works well.

1:25:47.810 --> 1:25:48.643
What time?

1:25:49.790 --> 1:25:51.940
- [Mary] Three or four
o'clock, would that work?

1:25:51.940 --> 1:25:53.730
- [Mr. Adams] Three o'clock's great.

1:25:53.730 --> 1:25:55.410
- [Mary] Wonderful, I'll see you then.

1:25:55.410 --> 1:25:56.950
Looking forward to it.

1:25:56.950 --> 1:25:59.434
- [Mr. Adams] I look
forward to seeing you too.

1:25:59.434 --> 1:26:00.851
- [Mary] Buh-bye.

1:26:50.370 --> 1:26:52.911
(grunting)

1:27:08.643 --> 1:27:10.893
(grunting)

1:27:26.598 --> 1:27:28.964
(grunting)

1:27:37.296 --> 1:27:40.104
(grunting)

1:28:03.815 --> 1:28:06.048
(grunting)
