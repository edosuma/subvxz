12:54.649 --> 12:56.067
--and I realized

12:56.067 --> 12:58.486
you wouldn't give me

12:56.067 --> 12:58.486
a second chance,

12:58.486 --> 12:59.820
not if you knew

12:58.486 --> 12:59.820
it was me...

12:59.820 --> 13:01.406
Because you killed

12:59.820 --> 13:01.406
my father.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.909
Yes.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.909
And I regret that.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.704
But I love you, Luisa.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.789
( whispers ):

13:07.704 --> 13:10.789
I've always...loved you.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.042
Why are you talking

13:10.789 --> 13:13.042
in that creepy voice?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.169
( in normal voice ):

13:13.042 --> 13:15.169
It...wasn't supposed

13:13.042 --> 13:15.169
to be creepy,

13:15.169 --> 13:16.713
it was supposed

13:15.169 --> 13:16.713
to be sexy.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.089
I don't even know how

13:16.713 --> 13:18.089
to talk to you anymore.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.048
You make me so nervous.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.467
Oh, I make<i> you</i> nervous?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.801
Yes! You're the

13:20.467 --> 13:22.801
only person that I

13:22.801 --> 13:24.929
have ever felt

13:22.801 --> 13:24.929
this way about.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.807
And you fell in love

13:26.889 --> 13:28.807
with me twice.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.144
Let's build

13:28.807 --> 13:31.144
a life together.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.063
Please.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.234
Say yes.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.572
( gasps )

13:42.572 --> 13:44.532
If I have sex with you

13:42.572 --> 13:44.532
once,

13:44.532 --> 13:46.326
it doesn't mean

13:44.532 --> 13:46.326
that I'm saying yes.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.496
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

13:56.085 --> 13:57.044
What's wrong?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.046
Can we ascend?

13:59.046 --> 14:00.965
Just to see

13:59.046 --> 14:00.965
if my brother

14:00.965 --> 14:02.592

you off.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.897
I'm the one that's here.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.566
I know.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.235
It's just that

14:19.942 --> 14:21.235
you killed my father.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.612
We're going around

14:21.235 --> 14:22.612

14:22.612 --> 14:24.155

14:26.658 --> 14:29.243
You need to make

14:26.658 --> 14:29.243
a decision.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.870
I wanna get off the sub,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.665
go to my island,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.665
start our life.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.000
What will it take

14:33.665 --> 14:36.000
for you to say yes?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.878
I need to see your list.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.798
The people I've slept with?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.798
It's long.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.257
Of the people you've killed.

like your writing teacher

14:51.766 --> 14:53.434
said.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.977
I mean...

14:54.977 --> 14:58.939
I have orgasms,

14:54.977 --> 14:58.939
unlike some people.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.400
Oh, sorry.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.526
Was that too bitchy?

15:02.652 --> 15:04.487
( phone vibrates )

15:02.652 --> 15:04.487
Oh.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.656
( gasps ):

15:04.487 --> 15:06.656
Mom! Hey, finally.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.783
I've been calling.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.783
XIOMARA:<i> I know. Sorry.</i>

15:08.783 --> 15:10.702
I didn't get a callback

15:08.783 --> 15:10.702
for<i> The Voice.</i>

15:10.702 --> 15:14.247
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.123
It's all part of the hustle,

15:14.247 --> 15:16.123
though, right?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.291
<i>Maybe.</i>

15:17.291 --> 15:19.794
Maybe I'm done with

15:17.291 --> 15:19.794
the hustle.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.462
What?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.923
The producer asked me

15:21.462 --> 15:23.923
this question:

15:23.923 --> 15:26.259
If I wasn't a singer,

15:23.923 --> 15:26.259
what would I be?

15:26.259 --> 15:27.552
And...

15:27.552 --> 15:29.679
<i>I don't know,</i>

15:27.552 --> 15:29.679
<i>it got me thinking.</i>

15:29.679 --> 15:33.140
I haven't really, seriously

15:29.679 --> 15:33.140
considered anything else

15:33.140 --> 15:34.434
since I was, like, 19.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.854
Because you love to sing.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.606
Yeah, well...

15:39.606 --> 15:41.691
maybe it's time to move on.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.069
What does she mean,

15:43.651 --> 15:45.069
"move on"?

15:45.069 --> 15:46.571
JANE:

15:45.069 --> 15:46.571
<i>She goes through these phases</i>

15:46.571 --> 15:48.072
<i>of self-doubt. She just needs</i>

15:46.571 --> 15:48.072
<i>a boost.</i>

15:48.072 --> 15:50.658
Like, um,

15:48.072 --> 15:50.658
another Paulina Rubio moment.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.912
No, no, no, no. I cannot ask

15:50.658 --> 15:53.912
Paulina for another favor.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.789
<i>Not enough time has passed.</i>

15:53.912 --> 15:55.789
What?

15:55.789 --> 15:58.875
Celebrity friendships need to

15:55.789 --> 15:58.875
be very carefully calibrated.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.960
Someone like Paulina,

15:58.875 --> 16:00.960
you ask a favor every...

16:00.960 --> 16:02.253
seven years.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.464
Someone like Gloria,

16:02.253 --> 16:04.464
every 20 years.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.634
Now, Oprah--

16:04.464 --> 16:07.634
You just don't ask favors.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.761
Your best bet is to ask Gayle.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.178
Gotcha. Okay.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.013
<i>Canadian celebs,</i>

16:11.178 --> 16:13.013
<i>well, you can ask anytime.</i>

16:13.013 --> 16:15.308
Michael Bublé

16:13.013 --> 16:15.308
has washed my car twice.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.684
But he's traveling now.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.684
<i>Dad,</i>

16:16.684 --> 16:18.478
okay, what about someone

16:16.684 --> 16:18.478
not famous?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.813
Like a music executive

16:19.813 --> 16:21.481
<i>who can get her</i>

16:19.813 --> 16:21.481
<i>singing backup maybe?</i>

16:21.481 --> 16:23.023
Let me work on it.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.818
Now, I have to run.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.779
The CW is interested

16:24.818 --> 16:27.779
in doing an American adaptation

16:27.779 --> 16:29.656
of<i> The Passions of Santos.</i>

16:29.656 --> 16:32.325
What's The CW? Like a...

16:29.656 --> 16:32.325
Like a streaming thing?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.367
<i>No, no.</i>

16:33.367 --> 16:34.786
It's a<i> huge</i> network!

16:34.786 --> 16:36.663
Look it up. Amazing shows.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.122
Fabulous lineups!

16:38.122 --> 16:40.333
<i>Anyway,</i>

16:38.122 --> 16:40.333
<i>if everything goes well,</i>

16:40.333 --> 16:42.669
I'm gonna be on a plane

16:40.333 --> 16:42.669
to Los Angeles tonight.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.044
<i>Well, good luck.</i>

16:44.044 --> 16:45.379
Let me know

16:44.044 --> 16:45.379
how things go.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.214
Ooh. Heh, heh.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.008
Uh, where's Mateo?

16:47.214 --> 16:49.008
He's napping.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.593
Perfect. How much time

16:49.008 --> 16:50.593
do we have?

16:50.593 --> 16:52.637
He'll be awake in,

16:50.593 --> 16:52.637
like, 20 minutes.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.221
Sweet. I'll just do

16:52.637 --> 16:54.221
the same exact thing

16:54.221 --> 16:56.808
I did last time,

16:54.221 --> 16:56.808
okay? Mwah.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.808
Uh...

16:56.808 --> 16:58.100
Wait.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.727
( moaning )

17:01.646 --> 17:03.648
Hey, so, maybe we don't do

17:03.648 --> 17:05.942
<i>exactly</i> the same thing

17:03.648 --> 17:05.942
as last time.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.527
What do you mean? Why?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.445
Well, we can try something

17:07.527 --> 17:09.445
different. For variety.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.864
There's no time.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.864
There's 20 minutes.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.365
Gotta be efficient.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.365
Michael, wait.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.825
Uh, but I faked it.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.535
What?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.161
My orgasm.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.706
Wh-why-why...

17:17.161 --> 17:19.706
why would you do that?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.167
I got nervous.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.167
A-And I wanted it to be perfect,

17:23.167 --> 17:24.919
and I saw that

17:23.167 --> 17:24.919
you were finishing.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.131
Wow.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.342
I know. I'm sorry.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.342
( sighs )

17:31.342 --> 17:33.720
Have you faked it before

17:31.342 --> 17:33.720
when we did other things?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.304
No. Definitely not.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.558
Okay. We'll just start

17:35.304 --> 17:38.558
with the other things, then.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.393
Thank you.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.147
( exhales )

17:51.654 --> 17:54.615
You know what? I just...

17:51.654 --> 17:54.615
I don't think it's happening.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.492
I'm too much in my head now.

Don't boo me, Rogelio.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.960
But you're going

18:04.083 --> 18:05.960
to love The CW.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.128
I don't even know what channel

18:05.960 --> 18:08.128
that is, and I own 50 percent

18:08.128 --> 18:10.924
of the show, and I don't want

18:08.128 --> 18:10.924
to do business with you again.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.969
Look... I get that you're

18:10.924 --> 18:14.969
upset about our breakup.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.888
This has nothing to do

18:14.969 --> 18:16.888
with that.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.098
I've already been approached

18:16.888 --> 18:19.098
to do other shows.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.725
I'm in talks with--

18:20.725 --> 18:22.852
But conquering the American

18:20.725 --> 18:22.852
market was your dream too.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.104
It was our favorite

18:25.104 --> 18:28.107
Well, that...and my erotic

( in normal voice ): Come on.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.946
Put your ego aside.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.114
It's good business.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.534
Fine.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.702
Separate rooms.

18:39.702 --> 18:40.912
I get the better view.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.655
Look, I don't like it either,

It's small.

26:27.044 --> 26:30.339
What's big is the connection

26:27.044 --> 26:30.339
between two souls.

26:30.339 --> 26:31.382
Mm?

26:32.590 --> 26:35.219
NARRATOR:

26:32.590 --> 26:35.219
<i>Which brings us here, now.</i>

26:35.219 --> 26:38.097
So...I just...

26:38.097 --> 26:40.391
I don't want you

26:38.097 --> 26:40.391
to worry tonight.

26:40.391 --> 26:42.642
This is about our love,

26:40.391 --> 26:42.642
you know?

26:42.642 --> 26:43.852
Who cares about the rest?

26:45.354 --> 26:46.397
Mm.

26:46.397 --> 26:48.107
What--?

26:46.397 --> 26:48.107
What do you mean?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.526
Just that

26:48.107 --> 26:50.526
the most important thing

26:50.526 --> 26:54.696
is our connection

26:50.526 --> 26:54.696
and intimacy and...

26:54.696 --> 26:56.490
What's wrong?

26:54.696 --> 26:56.490
( sighs )

26:56.490 --> 27:00.618
I'm just bummed that you think

26:56.490 --> 27:00.618
having sex with me is so bad

27:00.618 --> 27:02.955
that you've given up any

27:00.618 --> 27:02.955
hope of having an orgasm.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.542
No, no, no, no,

27:02.955 --> 27:06.542
that is not what I meant.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.502
I just didn't

27:06.542 --> 27:08.502
want to pressure you.

27:08.502 --> 27:11.088
I want us to get

27:08.502 --> 27:11.088
out of our heads.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.549
Mm.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.597
Well, I...

27:17.177 --> 27:19.597
Now I'm in my head.

27:19.597 --> 27:22.182
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.060
( sighs )

27:25.060 --> 27:27.271
I can talk dirty instead.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.981
Hmm?

27:27.271 --> 27:28.981
Maybe let's just...

27:28.981 --> 27:30.690
r-relax.

27:30.690 --> 27:33.319
We'll just relax.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.697
Oh, forget I told you.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.159
The sex is good,

27:37.697 --> 27:40.159
and I've had orgasms since.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.452
You're lying.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.578
No, I'm not.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.578

Hey, Dad.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.746
ROGELIO: Bad news.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.166
Hector's schedule changed.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.166
He can't come now.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.169
What? Oh, Mom canceled her gig

27:47.166 --> 27:50.169
at the Blue Penny.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.337
What-what can I do?

27:51.337 --> 27:52.796
<i>I don't know.</i>

27:52.796 --> 27:55.591
But, Dad... I found a list.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.635
Of alternate careers.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.595
I've never found a list before.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.139
I'll get someone there.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.057
Can we get back

28:02.139 --> 28:04.057
to the telenovela?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.851
Yes, of course.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.897
NARRATOR:

28:08.354 --> 28:10.897
<i>And we should get back to ours.</i>

28:10.897 --> 28:13.066
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

28:17.070 --> 28:18.113
( gasps )

28:24.161 --> 28:27.289
I was just coming to

28:24.161 --> 28:27.289
bring you an e-mail.

28:27.289 --> 28:28.457
It's from your brother.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.292
When we ascended

28:28.457 --> 28:30.292
today, I checked,

28:30.292 --> 28:32.002
and he didn't

28:30.292 --> 28:32.002
forget your birthday;

28:32.002 --> 28:33.587
we were just a day ahead.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.839
Thank you.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.801
You jumped.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.928
When I came in,

28:39.801 --> 28:41.928
you jumped.

28:41.928 --> 28:43.805
Uh-uh.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.160
<i>I really miss you.</i>

29:05.160 --> 29:07.079
No reply?

29:08.872 --> 29:10.624
Not yet.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.252
Have you seen my dad?

29:13.252 --> 29:16.255
Um, is that him

29:13.252 --> 29:16.255
over there with...

29:16.255 --> 29:17.881
Is that...?

29:17.881 --> 29:19.425
Oh, my God.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.301
( in Spanish ): Oh, my God.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.301
NARRATOR:<i> Oh, my God!</i>

Jane! I want you to meet

29:25.889 --> 29:26.932
my dear friends,

29:26.932 --> 29:28.475
Gloria and Emilio Estefan.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.143
Yes, thank you for coming.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.437
We've been friends

29:31.437 --> 29:32.979
with your father

29:31.437 --> 29:32.979
for over 20 years,

29:32.979 --> 29:35.190
and he's never asked us

29:32.979 --> 29:35.190
for a favor before.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.942
I just don't think that way.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.111
So we knew

29:36.942 --> 29:39.111
this must be<i> major.</i>

29:41.071 --> 29:44.575
NARRATOR:

29:41.071 --> 29:44.575
<i>Wow! Just look at her.</i>

29:45.992 --> 29:47.994
Hey, I'm sorry.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.994
That fan is making me cold.

29:47.994 --> 29:48.954
Should we sit?

29:48.954 --> 29:50.706
( faintly ):

29:48.954 --> 29:50.706
Yeah.

29:50.706 --> 29:53.459
Good evening!

29:53.459 --> 29:54.752
( applause )

29:54.752 --> 29:57.087
Thank you all

29:54.752 --> 29:57.087
for coming.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.423
Oh, wow, I see some guys

29:59.423 --> 30:01.550
who usually come out

29:59.423 --> 30:01.550
to the Blue Penny. Hi, guys!

30:01.550 --> 30:02.926
( crowd cheering )

30:04.136 --> 30:05.554
Love that.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.139
It helps with the nerves.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.319

30:49.055 --> 30:50.974
So...

30:50.974 --> 30:53.935
thank you for giving me

30:50.974 --> 30:53.935
the e-mail.

30:53.935 --> 30:54.936
You didn't have to.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.313
I want you to be happy.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.106
I know.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.776
That's why I can't

30:58.106 --> 31:00.776
say good-bye to my brother.

31:01.735 --> 31:02.986
Not forever.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.947
What if you don't have to?

31:05.947 --> 31:09.409
You go back to Miami,

31:05.947 --> 31:09.409
tell the cops everything.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.328
When I'm around

31:09.409 --> 31:11.328
your family,

31:11.328 --> 31:12.621
I'll have a different face...

31:12.621 --> 31:14.039
That's the thing.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.875
You...around my family.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.836
I've changed.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.420
I'm done with crime.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.422
You have to trust that.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.591
And if you can't--

31:24.591 --> 31:26.510
if you're going to jump

31:26.510 --> 31:28.178
whenever I enter a room,

31:28.178 --> 31:30.681
then I'll drop you off

31:28.178 --> 31:30.681
at Port Kembla, you can fly home

31:30.681 --> 31:32.349
and never hear from me again.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.059
So?

31:36.144 --> 31:37.563

Everything good

31:41.900 --> 31:46.739
with you and Jane?

31:46.739 --> 31:48.741
She told you.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.950
Look, I'm here to help.

31:50.950 --> 31:54.580
But I really can't diagnose a

32:06.592 --> 32:08.761
( exhales )

32:08.761 --> 32:10.387
I don't know.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.597
What?

32:11.597 --> 32:12.806
She wants to be one.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.266
I am one.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.394
But right now, career-wise,

32:17.394 --> 32:20.647
I-I feel like I'm at

32:17.394 --> 32:20.647
a bit of a crossroads.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.023
<i>Interesante.</i>

32:22.023 --> 32:23.400
Well, what's

32:22.023 --> 32:23.400
more interesting

32:23.400 --> 32:25.569
is how much she loves singing.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.569
Agreed.

32:25.569 --> 32:28.405
Yeah, tell them about that, Mom,

32:25.569 --> 32:28.405
how you've been at it forever,

32:28.405 --> 32:29.573
and she just needs

32:28.405 --> 32:29.573
her break.

32:29.573 --> 32:30.616
XIOMARA:

32:29.573 --> 32:30.616
Or maybe I don't.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.868
I-I have my weekly gig.

32:32.868 --> 32:33.827
Maybe that's enough.

32:33.827 --> 32:35.579
With no fame component?

32:35.579 --> 32:38.248
Maybe I just

32:35.579 --> 32:38.248
have to accept that

32:38.248 --> 32:40.083
that's not

32:38.248 --> 32:40.083
gonna happen.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.126
Huh.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.126
Interesting.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.836
I'd still

32:41.126 --> 32:42.836
sing.

32:42.836 --> 32:45.130
I'd just pursue

32:42.836 --> 32:45.130
other things professionally.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.757
Mom, come on, you're

32:45.130 --> 32:46.757
really gonna regret it

32:46.757 --> 32:48.341
if you don't talk music

32:46.757 --> 32:48.341
with the Estefans.

32:48.341 --> 32:49.760
I mean,

32:48.341 --> 32:49.760
that is their thing.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.470
EMILIO:

32:49.760 --> 32:51.470
Actually, we have

32:49.760 --> 32:51.470
different, uh,

32:51.470 --> 32:52.805
dentures.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.805
He means "ventures."

32:52.805 --> 32:54.347

GLORIA:

32:54.347 --> 32:56.475
It's true.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.475
We have several restaurants.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.435
We have a show on

32:56.475 --> 32:58.435
Broadway,<i> On Your Feet,</i>

33:00.186 --> 33:02.147
That's great.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.399
You know, but that's just not

33:02.147 --> 33:04.399
really what you're known for.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.359
Well, it depends on the

33:04.399 --> 33:06.359
circle we're traveling in.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.654
Yeah, I'm pretty sure, like,

I just need you

Gloria Estefan!

33:21.667 --> 33:24.544
I'm so sorry,

I'm sorry.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.640
I don't know what happened.

33:38.851 --> 33:42.020
so important to you for so long.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.648
Ah.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.065
What?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.444
Just that...

33:49.444 --> 33:52.823
I'm realizing that this

33:49.444 --> 33:52.823
isn't totally about me.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.783
What do you mean?

33:54.783 --> 33:57.285
You gave up something

33:54.783 --> 33:57.285
pretty big lately.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.496
My virginity?

33:59.496 --> 34:01.164
No.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.000
I'm happy it's gone.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.628
I-I'm married. I have a kid.

34:06.628 --> 34:09.506
It's been, like, this weight.

34:09.506 --> 34:12.384
I've been dying to get

34:09.506 --> 34:12.384
rid of this for so long.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.344
Oh, honey...

34:14.344 --> 34:17.764
This is so stupid!

34:14.344 --> 34:17.764
I'm married.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.474
( sniffles )

34:19.474 --> 34:22.853
I wanted it to be gone.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.980
I don't know. I just...

34:24.980 --> 34:26.648
I feel weird.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.108
Like...

34:31.069 --> 34:32.696
...I lost something,

34:32.696 --> 34:35.323
like a part of my identity.

34:35.323 --> 34:36.658
( sniffles )

34:36.658 --> 34:37.826
Yeah.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.286
I get that.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.163
And I blame the flower.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.206
What?

34:43.206 --> 34:44.958
"It's perfect untouched.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.126
Then crumple it up,

34:44.958 --> 34:47.126
now it's ruined."

34:47.126 --> 34:49.880
I know I'm not ruined.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.050
But you feel like you lost

34:49.880 --> 34:53.050
something, and you didn't.

34:53.050 --> 34:56.053
You just<i> gained</i>

34:53.050 --> 34:56.053
something.

34:56.053 --> 34:58.555
A whole new dimension

34:56.053 --> 34:58.555
of your life,

34:58.555 --> 35:00.640
your relationship.

35:02.684 --> 35:05.144
What if we're not compatible?

35:05.144 --> 35:07.439
It hasn't been great?

35:07.439 --> 35:10.984
We're not really talking

35:07.439 --> 35:10.984
about it with other people.

35:10.984 --> 35:14.780
Ah. Got it.

35:14.780 --> 35:18.658
Okay, so you know, this has

35:14.780 --> 35:18.658
nothing to do with you.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.159
But...

35:20.159 --> 35:24.831
with sex, it can take

35:20.159 --> 35:24.831
time to find your groove

35:24.831 --> 35:26.541
and figure out what you like,

35:26.541 --> 35:29.002
what you need.

35:29.002 --> 35:30.921
You're just

35:29.002 --> 35:30.921
starting out.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.505
You'll get there.

36:08.416 --> 36:13.130
Okay, I'm down

36:08.416 --> 36:13.130
to give porn a chance...

36:13.130 --> 36:16.215
That's not porn.

36:13.130 --> 36:16.215
It's us.

36:17.676 --> 36:21.054
Yeah. Lina asked for

36:17.676 --> 36:21.054
a play-by-play.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.639
I wasn't gonna

36:21.054 --> 36:22.639
give her that,

36:22.639 --> 36:26.434
but I realized maybe it could

36:22.639 --> 36:26.434
help me figure out

36:26.434 --> 36:28.145
where it went wrong.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.272
So, um...

36:32.858 --> 36:34.317
There.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.863
That was good, right?

36:35.485 --> 36:37.863
Oh, yeah.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.823
Yeah, I really liked that.

Definitely.

36:41.867 --> 36:42.951
( exhales )

36:42.951 --> 36:45.370
And I liked that.

Mmm, yeah.

Now, can we finally stop

38:31.059 --> 38:32.894
obsessing over

38:32.894 --> 38:34.813
that virgin whore nonsense?

38:34.813 --> 38:38.150
( in Spanish ):

38:34.813 --> 38:38.150
There are so many other

38:34.813 --> 38:38.150
interesting things about me.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.734
Your bracelet,

38:43.321 --> 38:44.322
<i>Ay.</i>

38:44.322 --> 38:45.573
Couldn't help it,

<i>Ay.</i>

38:51.955 --> 38:53.873
<i>Ay.</i>

38:53.873 --> 38:56.751
But at least he's not insane

38:53.873 --> 38:56.751
like his cousin Coco!

38:56.751 --> 38:58.128
( in Spanish ):

38:56.751 --> 38:58.128
Who are you calling insane?

38:58.128 --> 38:59.420
Shh!

I'm talking.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.839
( whispering indistinctly )

39:00.839 --> 39:01.965
Now look,

39:01.965 --> 39:03.341
you didn't hear this from me,

but

39:04.467 --> 39:07.220
here's the scoop with Coco...

39:29.284 --> 39:32.245
why my sister betrayed me?

39:32.245 --> 39:34.413
What do you mean?

39:32.245 --> 39:34.413
I made it up.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.499
And you just happened

39:34.413 --> 39:36.499
to guess

39:36.499 --> 39:38.918
that she was in love

39:36.499 --> 39:38.918
with my fiancé?

39:38.918 --> 39:42.130
Admit it, you read

39:38.918 --> 39:42.130

39:50.763 --> 39:52.182
What happened?

39:52.182 --> 39:54.017

not on our

And I am done being dumped

39:58.104 --> 39:59.981
I thought you said

39:58.104 --> 39:59.981
it wasn't about that.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.441
Look...

40:02.441 --> 40:04.402
I didn't want to date you.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.363
You pursued<i> me.</i>

40:06.363 --> 40:08.698
And as soon as I realized

40:06.363 --> 40:08.698
I still had feelings for Xo,

40:08.698 --> 40:10.408
I Tweeted...

40:12.202 --> 40:14.913
And I should have called.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.748
I'm sorry.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.876
But I just didn't want

to lead you on, romantically.

We keep coming back

40:30.387 --> 40:32.222
