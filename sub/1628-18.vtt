to get some of her stuff.

he can cause anyway.

I wanna talk to you about is,

is that she's on her way here.

15:27.385 --> 15:32.004
August, you are in pain. Waste your
energy not on me but on your affliction.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.756
All you need to worry about
is whether I can help you.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.843
And the answer is, indeed I can.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.178
(SIGHS) Thank God.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.264
There are, however, conditions.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.439
Yeah.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.237
I need an item of great value to you.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.398
Money? I have some...

15:47.531 --> 15:49.692
No. That comes later.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.695
I need something close to your heart.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.198
Something that cannot be replaced.

16:05.382 --> 16:09.375
This? lt's worthless.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.710
The pendant, perhaps. But the string?

16:11.805 --> 16:15.218
It was the string your father used
to animate you

16:15.809 --> 16:17.800
as a freshly carved puppet.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.724
In a way, it first gave you life.

16:21.815 --> 16:25.808
It will serve as payment from your soul.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.067
Will it work?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.187
Perhaps.

16:41.084 --> 16:45.123
Now, as any vendor from this world,
I also need payment from your wallet.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.502
Ten thousand American dollars.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.253
Ten thousand?

16:52.262 --> 16:56.426
Bring the money tonight and
you shall never turn to wood again.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.930
I know about August.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.936
He came to me
shortly after the curse broke

17:07.027 --> 17:08.938
and asked if I would return him
to what he was.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.565
Why didn't you?

17:10.655 --> 17:13.112
Because what he was is what he is.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.197
Do you remember the morning I found
you on that beach all those years ago?

17:17.287 --> 17:19.369
The day I turned your son
into a real boy?

17:19.456 --> 17:22.448
Yes. It was the happiest day of my life.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.956
I told Pinocchio so long as he remained
brave, truthful and unselfish,

17:27.047 --> 17:28.708
he would stay a real boy.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.665
But I'm afraid he did not.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.134
That is why he changed back.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.094
And that's why
there's nothing I can do for him.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.010
It's true he's done
some things he regrets,

17:39.100 --> 17:40.681
we all have.

17:40.769 --> 17:42.680
But shouldn't he have another chance?

17:43.355 --> 17:45.562
If there is still a path of redemption
for August,

17:45.649 --> 17:48.140
it is one that he must travel on his own.

17:48.276 --> 17:51.484
No one can force him
or it will not be true.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.071
Don't despair, Marco.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.025
I know there's still hope for your son.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.780
There has to be.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.464
Hey.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.588
You look like you could use a drink.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.550
Yeah, well,
I wasn't planning on staying very long.

18:22.686 --> 18:25.894
Come on, humor me.
Celebrating alone is no fun.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.812
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

18:38.285 --> 18:40.116
Figured a medicine man
wouldn't take plastic.

18:43.206 --> 18:44.195
Um...

18:44.791 --> 18:45.826
To second chances.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.327
Who knew they'd be so expensive.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.421
So what brought you to him?

18:57.971 --> 18:59.006
Cancer.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.429
-(S|GHS)
-Very rare form.

19:01.558 --> 19:05.392
When I was diagnosed, the specialist
told me lwas on borrowed time.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.181
Ever since, I've been all over the world
trying to find a cure.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.559
Doctors, healers. You name it.
Anyone who could promise a miracle.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.649
And no one could.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.742
And then,

19:20.035 --> 19:21.741
then I heard about The Dragon.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.239
(WINCES)

19:28.043 --> 19:29.249
How about you?

19:32.464 --> 19:34.250
-Skin condition.
-Acne? (CHUCKLES)

19:34.758 --> 19:35.747
Yeah.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.173
You know, there are creams.

19:37.260 --> 19:42.425
I wish. Now, this condition,
once it spreads, I'm done for.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.548
Well, I'm glad you found him, too.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.052
Thanks.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.598
He tell you he needed a personal item?

19:50.273 --> 19:53.185
Who carries something like that
around with them anyway?

19:54.903 --> 19:58.566
Luckily, I had a photo of
my grandmother and me in my wallet.

19:59.240 --> 20:03.574
Now, it's gone. But if my cancer is, too...

20:06.164 --> 20:07.825
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

20:10.377 --> 20:11.366
Oh.

20:11.461 --> 20:12.917
Sorry. I'll be right back.

Hey. Long time.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.761
For someone who's spent
his entire life running,

21:08.852 --> 21:10.934
you should be in better shape.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.680
Well, IwiII be.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.728
You have what you promised?

21:25.869 --> 21:27.985
I believe we discussed a price.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.995
The money? Do you have it?

(SIGHS)

21:36.921 --> 21:37.910

The body has a strange way
of sending us signals, doesn't it?

21:48.892 --> 21:51.258
The tricky part isn't hearing them,

21:51.895 --> 21:54.011
but knowing what they truly mean.

21:55.273 --> 21:57.559
Are you sure this can cure me?

21:57.692 --> 22:01.480
What's in this bottle will stop you
from turning to wood, yes.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.402
But that's just a symptom.

22:03.907 --> 22:06.899
Only you can cure yourself.

you deserve your fate.

23:09.764 --> 23:10.970
(SOBBING)

23:23.987 --> 23:25.568
Not much of a decorator.

23:28.074 --> 23:32.067
Then again, I guess a man
made of wood doesn't require much.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.573
You can see me? You believe?

23:34.664 --> 23:38.282
Do you think I would have chased down
someone called The Dragon if I didn't?

23:38.376 --> 23:39.991
I don't understand.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.328
What are you doing in Storybrooke?
How is this even possible?

23:43.423 --> 23:45.334
What I'm doing in Storybrooke
doesn't concern you.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.507
But I need you to do something.

23:47.594 --> 23:51.132
And after what you pulled
in Hong Kong, you owe me.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.805
What could I ever do for you?

23:54.892 --> 23:56.507
Leave.

23:57.228 --> 24:00.391
It's a simple request,
considering what I'm about to offer you.

24:05.903 --> 24:09.361
No. You're going to explain this.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.446
Did you follow me?

24:11.534 --> 24:12.865
Are you like me?

24:13.453 --> 24:17.116
Magical? No. I'm quite human.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.740
But forget for a second
why I'm here and who I am.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.539
And instead, ask yourself
the more important question. How?

24:24.213 --> 24:26.340
My cancer was
a death sentence, remember?

24:26.424 --> 24:28.836
Yet, here I am.

24:28.926 --> 24:32.544
The Dragon.
The liquid in the bottle, it worked.

24:32.639 --> 24:37.429
lt cured me, August.
And it can cure you, too.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.721
I still have some of it left.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.771
The bottle's in my apartment
in New York.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.390
You can go get it.

24:46.069 --> 24:49.277
All I ask is that
you leave Storybrooke now

24:50.490 --> 24:52.071
and never return.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.700
Neal. You're the fiancee.

24:59.791 --> 25:00.997
(SCOFFS)

25:01.584 --> 25:03.495
Are you and Neal here for the magic?

25:04.671 --> 25:08.960
Are you two trying to take
the magic from Storybrooke?

25:09.092 --> 25:12.584
Neal has nothing to do
with any of this, okay?

25:13.221 --> 25:14.461
He knows as much as you do.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.924
Actually, now you know a lot more.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.176
So do we have a deal?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.932
I can't leave without knowing
what you're doing here.

25:24.774 --> 25:25.934
Sure you can.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.016
And you will.

25:28.111 --> 25:31.274
You're the same man
I left in a Hong Kong gutter.

25:31.364 --> 25:35.198
A man willing to do anything
to save himself.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.149
And that's what I'm offering, August.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.278
Salvation.

25:46.379 --> 25:50.042
You know, I'm all set on towels,
if that's why you're here.

25:50.133 --> 25:51.339
lair dry.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.343
I'm here because I realized
why you looked so familiar to me.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.301
It's because we have met before,
haven't we?

25:59.726 --> 26:00.715
Owen.

26:03.938 --> 26:08.523
I kept this all these years
as a reminder of our time together.

26:08.651 --> 26:11.017
You were just a boy
when you gave this to me.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.981
Now look at you.

26:13.656 --> 26:14.987
All grown up.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.361
No wonder I didn't recognize you.

26:22.665 --> 26:24.326
Yeah, but I recognized you.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.659
Because you look
exactly the same, Regina.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.245
It's as if no time has passed for you.

26:30.339 --> 26:34.378

Does wonders for the skin.

26:34.886 --> 26:36.046
You could have come to me, Owen.

26:36.179 --> 26:38.044
You could've told me
who you were and why you're here.

26:38.181 --> 26:40.547
I think you know why I'm here.

26:40.683 --> 26:41.968
I honestly don't.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.344
I'm looking for my father.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.596
Your father?

26:45.563 --> 26:48.771
He left shortly after you did.
I never saw him again.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.849
I don't believe you.

26:51.027 --> 26:53.439
Be that as it may, it's the truth.

26:53.571 --> 26:56.438
People don'tjust disappear, Regina.

26:56.574 --> 26:59.782
Scared little boys tend to have
overactive imaginations.

26:59.869 --> 27:02.360
Well, I'm not a scared little boy
anymore, Madame Mayor.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.288
It's taken me a long time
to get back here.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.283
I'm not leaving without my father.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.117
I'm afraid you are.

27:10.213 --> 27:11.623
Because he's not here.

27:14.801 --> 27:18.714
I'll let Granny know that
you'll be checking out tomorrow.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.514
Or what?

27:20.598 --> 27:23.510
Contrary to what you might think,

27:23.601 --> 27:25.808
people can just disappear.

27:28.731 --> 27:31.222
This is all my fault.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.228
Our children make
their own decisions, Marco.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.401
You can't blame yourself
for anything that's happened.

27:35.488 --> 27:39.481
Yes, I can.
And you should blame me, too.

27:41.244 --> 27:44.077
The wardrobe I built for you,

27:44.163 --> 27:46.620
the one that transported Emma
to this world?

27:46.958 --> 27:48.744
She did not go alone.

27:48.835 --> 27:49.995
MARY: Of course she did.

27:50.086 --> 27:52.452
The wardrobe only had enough magic
to transport one person.

27:52.588 --> 27:55.125
No. That was a lie
I made the Blue Fairy tell you.

27:56.259 --> 27:59.251
It had enough magic to transport two.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.089
And it did.

28:01.681 --> 28:05.094
Your daughter and my son.

28:05.852 --> 28:06.967
Pinocchio.

28:07.103 --> 28:09.094
I could have gone with her?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.769
With Emma?

28:10.857 --> 28:15.100
There is no apology I could give
that could ever make up for what I did.

28:16.612 --> 28:17.647
But I am so sorry.

28:18.531 --> 28:19.566
EMMA: Mary Margaret!

28:19.657 --> 28:21.522
What are you doing? He's apologizing.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.365
No, no. It's okay. I deserved that.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.613
No. That wasn't me.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.320
Marco, I am so sorry.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.493
I'm not myself. You just made a mistake.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.787
I would've done
the same thing for my child.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.999
I forgive you.
You were protecting your son.

28:36.132 --> 28:41.252
No. l burdened him with a weight
no child should have to bear.

28:41.345 --> 28:42.801
And I called it love.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.494
Your photograph. It's on the desk.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.831
Do not forget to take it when you leave.

29:25.765 --> 29:29.508
Interesting choice of words from
someone who lied about being sick.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.935
You're right. I don't have cancer.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.936
And yet you sought me out.

29:35.566 --> 29:40.185
I've been searching for someone
like you for a very long time.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.359
Ah.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.397
For magic.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.444
It's rare in this world.

29:47.161 --> 29:50.870
So rare most would say it's fiction.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.697
But not you.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.248
Not me.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.416
But finding it,

29:56.545 --> 29:58.797
that has not been easy.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.085
I found the world full of frauds.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.084
Until you.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.554
l've analyzed the contents of this bottle

30:08.641 --> 30:11.223
with the most sophisticated techniques
available to man.

30:12.103 --> 30:13.968
You know what I found?

30:14.397 --> 30:15.557
Nothing.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.180
So I'm a fraud, too.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.400
No.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.568
Literally nothing.

30:22.655 --> 30:27.490
The liquid in this bottle doesn't contain
a single element found in this world.

30:29.412 --> 30:30.618
Can you explain that?

30:31.080 --> 30:32.741
What I create is not from this world,

30:32.832 --> 30:34.823
because the people who need my help

30:34.917 --> 30:38.284
suffer from afflictions
that science cannot treat.

30:40.631 --> 30:44.340
People like the man you stole that from.

30:44.427 --> 30:46.258
I didn't steal anything.

30:47.138 --> 30:49.049
I paid for what's in this bottle.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.432
But now that l have it,

30:54.103 --> 30:55.843
I can't risk anyone else finding you.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.101
(CRACKUNG)

31:00.609 --> 31:01.940
It was nice meeting you.

31:10.119 --> 31:11.655
You haven't met me.

31:13.039 --> 31:15.280
At least not the real me.

32:08.177 --> 32:12.546
(SHOUTING) Emma? Hello?
Is anyone here?

32:19.105 --> 32:20.390
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

32:21.190 --> 32:22.225
Emma Swan.

32:22.358 --> 32:24.019
Emma, it's August.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.225
-August?
-Listen to me.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.101
-l have to warn you.
-August...

32:30.199 --> 32:31.564
Warn me? Warn me about what?

32:35.371 --> 32:37.111
You disappoint me, August.

32:37.206 --> 32:39.322
I know what you did to The Dragon.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.916
A few days after you left,

32:44.046 --> 32:46.583
/ went back to beg him to ﬁx me.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.544
And we both know what / found.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.217
At the time,
/ was too wrapped up in myself

32:52.346 --> 32:54.211
to wonder what had happened.

32:54.557 --> 32:58.391
To question who could have
done such a thing.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.386
But then I found this photo in your car,

33:01.897 --> 33:02.977
and it hit me.

33:03.065 --> 33:06.432
You and your grandmother,
you went back there.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.768
You killed him.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.986
You should have left.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.199
I counted on you
to want to save yourself.

33:16.287 --> 33:18.243
Maybe that's what I'm trying to do.

33:19.582 --> 33:20.913
I've lived a life

33:21.000 --> 33:25.710
of selfishness, cowardice,
and dishonesty.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.882
And only I can cure that.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.633
Not magic. Not science. Just me.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.796
I care about the people in this town.

33:36.891 --> 33:39.098
And if you wanted
The Dragon's little bit of magic,

33:39.226 --> 33:41.217
well, you have hit the mother lode here,

33:41.312 --> 33:44.520
and you are not going
to harm anyone to get it.

33:45.107 --> 33:46.813
I'm going to warn them.

33:47.651 --> 33:48.766
No.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.101
You're not.

33:50.613 --> 33:52.444
(CRACKUNG)
(GRUNnNG)

34:02.625 --> 34:05.241
lf August is still at the station,
he's not picking up.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.118
August!

34:11.133 --> 34:12.293
(GROANS)

34:12.843 --> 34:14.299
August!

34:16.472 --> 34:17.552
My child.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.551
My boy. My boy!

34:20.851 --> 34:22.261
What happened to you?

34:22.353 --> 34:23.889
I'm so sorry, Papa.

34:24.021 --> 34:25.136
MARCO: No.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.889
There is nothing to apologize for.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.065
Everything is going to be all right.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.066
-Emma.
-August.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.282
Emma...

34:39.370 --> 34:40.655
She's...

34:49.505 --> 34:51.245
MARCO: Oh, no.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.705
Not again.

34:54.093 --> 34:55.333
(SOBBING)

34:59.098 --> 35:00.838
-August?
-No.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.548
It can't end this way.

35:02.685 --> 35:04.300
He was supposed
to get a second chance.

35:04.395 --> 35:05.384
What happened?

35:05.521 --> 35:08.763
Someone killed him to stop him
from telling us something.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.894
He used his last dying breath
to warn us.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.897
I will not let that be in vain.

35:17.866 --> 35:21.154
"Brave, truthful and unselfish."

35:21.954 --> 35:25.538
Brave, truthful and unselfish!

35:25.708 --> 35:27.619
Don't you see what this means?

35:27.710 --> 35:29.701
That's what Pinocchio
was supposed to be.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.502
There's still hope.
We need the Blue Fairy.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.625
I'm here, Henry.

35:34.717 --> 35:36.002
What does Henry mean?

35:36.093 --> 35:39.301
l was able to turn Pinocchio
into a real boy after he sacrificed

35:39.388 --> 35:41.549
his life for Marco's.

35:41.724 --> 35:45.637
If his actions today were indeed
brave, truthful and unselfish,

35:45.728 --> 35:48.390
then you're right,
there's a chance I can do it again.

35:48.897 --> 35:52.890
Please, I beg of you. Try.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.247
Father?

36:15.883 --> 36:17.248
Pinocchio?

36:21.388 --> 36:22.889
Look.

36:24.058 --> 36:25.264
Look.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.217
I'm a real boy.

36:28.645 --> 36:29.896
I'm a real boy!

36:41.283 --> 36:42.363
Honey.

36:42.451 --> 36:44.783
lt's. .. It's true.

36:47.456 --> 36:49.287
Do better this time, Pinocchio.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.784
Pinocchio? That's...

36:53.879 --> 36:54.959
Yeah.

36:56.799 --> 36:58.164
Pinocchio,

36:58.300 --> 37:00.541
l have to ask you a question.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.797
I need you to think real hard, okay?

37:03.680 --> 37:05.716
Before you turned into a little boy,

37:06.642 --> 37:08.724
you were trying to tell us
something very important.

37:08.811 --> 37:10.426
Do you remember?

37:11.855 --> 37:14.107
You were trying to warn us
about something.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.148
I don't remember.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.314
If I did, I would be truthful.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.654
I promise.

37:40.342 --> 37:45.006
If you want to head back to New York,
I wouldn't blame you.

37:45.139 --> 37:47.505
I know this isn't what you signed up for.

37:50.894 --> 37:53.852
What I signed up for is you.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.518
I love you.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.477
I can't believe how lucky I was
to have met you.

38:03.365 --> 38:04.696
We were both lucky.

38:05.909 --> 38:08.992
It must have been one hell
of a flight from Hong Kong.

38:09.496 --> 38:10.576
You've looked better.

38:10.706 --> 38:11.912
Well, I've felt better.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.910
I'm turning back to wood, Neal.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.038
Which means that
Emma's in Storybrooke.

38:17.171 --> 38:18.581
You're going there, aren't you?

38:18.714 --> 38:21.922
I gotta get her to break the curse
to stop what's happening to me.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.591
If she breaks the curse,
my father is gonna remember who he is

38:24.720 --> 38:25.800
and come looking for me.

38:25.888 --> 38:28.379
Flip side, you get to see Emma again.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.847
I'm not sure she wants to see me.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.765
You never know.

38:36.732 --> 38:39.474
When the curse is broken,
I'll send you a postcard.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.195
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REWING)

38:56.210 --> 38:57.700
Oh! (GASPS)

38:58.587 --> 39:00.498
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

39:00.589 --> 39:03.422
No, it was me. I'm in a hurry.
l'm late for work.

39:03.550 --> 39:07.134
Ugh. Here, you know what,
take my scarf. It will cover up the stain.

39:10.599 --> 39:12.590
It's perfect. Thank you.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.133
-(CHUCKLES)
-Sorry.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.224
-l'm sorry.
-Thank you.

39:18.315 --> 39:20.180
l'm Tamara.

39:24.947 --> 39:25.936
Henry.

39:28.659 --> 39:29.774
We gotta talk.

39:32.621 --> 39:35.784
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I lied to you about your dad.

39:38.085 --> 39:41.543
I promise I will never lie to you again.

39:42.256 --> 39:43.837
Just don't push me away.

39:45.634 --> 39:47.340
I won't.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.105
You ready to tell me what's going on?

40:10.200 --> 40:11.189
MARY: Yes.

40:11.285 --> 40:14.322
But before I do,
you have to promise you won't get mad.

40:14.997 --> 40:16.487
That always means good news. (SIGHS)

40:18.667 --> 40:19.827
I promise.

40:21.503 --> 40:22.663
(SIGHS)

40:23.714 --> 40:26.171
David, last week,

40:27.467 --> 40:29.594
I went to Regina's house
and confronted her.

40:29.678 --> 40:31.885
Are you out of your mind?

40:32.014 --> 40:34.005
-You promised not to get mad.
-l'm not mad!

40:34.099 --> 40:35.509
I can see that.

40:38.312 --> 40:39.802
She could've killed you.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.432
I know.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.229
That's why I went.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.065
So she would kill me.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.069
I couldn't take the guilt
over what I did to Cora.

40:50.157 --> 40:52.148
I could barely breathe.
I told her to end it.

40:52.242 --> 40:54.949
And she ripped out my heart.

40:55.078 --> 40:57.285
And when she took it out,

40:57.372 --> 40:59.454
my heart, David,

40:59.541 --> 41:02.157
it had started to blacken
because of what I did.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.163
Why didn't you tell me?

41:04.254 --> 41:08.247
Because telling you makes things real,
and I needed to believe it wasn't.

41:08.342 --> 41:11.880
That I could find a way to stop it,
that redemption was possible.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.631
Well, it is. Look at August.

41:13.722 --> 41:17.180
But it cost him everything.

41:17.351 --> 41:18.466
Oh.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.856
You are not him, Mary Margaret.

41:27.194 --> 41:29.560
And you sure as hell aren't Regina.

41:31.239 --> 41:34.652
Which means those are not
the only two options.

41:35.452 --> 41:36.988
We'll find another way. I know it.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.695
But what makes you so sure?

41:41.416 --> 41:43.122
This does.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.417
And I know it better than anyone.

41:56.473 --> 41:57.588
(BUZZING)

41:59.559 --> 42:02.346
Hey. Why haven't you called me back?
Where are you?

42:02.437 --> 42:03.722
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

42:07.234 --> 42:08.223
HER: Right here.

42:10.779 --> 42:12.610
Sorry I'm late. It's been a heck of a day.

42:12.698 --> 42:15.781
I don't have much time. Neal's in
the shower. I only have a few minutes.

42:15.909 --> 42:17.365
Then let's not waste them.
