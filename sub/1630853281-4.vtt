what you guys are doing down here.

There is not as much

This is bullshit!

00:22.120 --> 00:23.840
I've been watching young Dimma.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.800
I've been thinking
about putting him in the film.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.280
I'd love to take him to Indo.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.040

REG: This is far from normal.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.520

to the Grand Canyon. (CHUCKLES)

Actually, he's in Laguna Beach.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.840
The Grand Canyon is in Arizona.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.360
Oh, right.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.760
Bigger than you think, isn't it?
It is.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.200
I will have a red wine,
please, Barry.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.360

I'm OK.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.480

with Trotter away.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.760

29:48.760 --> 29:50.640

to pick up off the floor, I guess.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.040
My brother being in that film

30:17.040 --> 30:20.200
is one of the things
keeping him alive right now.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.160
We're grateful.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.920
So, how is Trotter going?

30:31.600 --> 30:34.200
I've hardly heard. (CHUCKLES)

30:34.200 --> 30:36.600
Says he can't work out
the time difference.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.760
Oh, so he's smart enough
to start Lightwave US for himself,

30:39.760 --> 30:42.520
but can't figure out
how to use a payphone? (SCOFFS)

31:34.240 --> 31:35.240
Ah.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.400
I saw Tracy.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.600
I think she's worried
about you getting scurvy.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.600
How're you goin'?

31:55.600 --> 31:57.920
I've been better.

You weren't in class yesterday.
Had to see the headmaster.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.960
I heard there was some trouble
with Mr Colston?

33:59.960 --> 34:01.120
Who's been talking?

34:01.120 --> 34:02.600
No-one.

It's just between us.

for telling the truth, right?

34:09.680 --> 34:11.440
There's nothing to tell.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.680
You don't owe Mr Colston anything.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.640
Mr Colston is just a friend.

34:16.640 --> 34:21.200
I mean...not like a friend. I guess
I sorta had a crush on him for a bit.

34:21.200 --> 34:24.360
But it was all just in my head,
you know?

34:27.040 --> 34:29.360
Is that what you told Mr Lockwood?

34:29.360 --> 34:30.640
Yep.

34:31.680 --> 34:35.160
And what did he say?
That the matter was closed.

34:36.680 --> 34:39.120
Tania, you're a bright girl.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.760
You can do anything you want.

34:40.760 --> 34:43.200
I know,
that's why I'm leaving school.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.320
I can get more shifts here.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.040
If that's what YOU want.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.320
It's better to save up
and get a car, isn't it?

34:52.320 --> 34:54.920

why he feels he's welcome here.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.720
It's a small town.
There's nowhere else to eat.

45:11.720 --> 45:14.600
Are you defending him too?
No, Dad.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.360
I don't know
why you stay in this place.

45:19.760 --> 45:20.840
(SIGHS)

45:20.840 --> 45:22.240
OK.

45:23.240 --> 45:24.960
Happy birthday, Tracy.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.040
Thank you for this.

45:30.040 --> 45:32.160
It was nice to see you, Dad.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.360
Scum!

46:11.680 --> 46:13.440
Where are all your mates?

46:14.760 --> 46:17.280
I could say the same to you.

46:19.080 --> 46:21.200
It's my birthday.

46:23.080 --> 46:24.720
I know.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.240
That's half-full.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.560
(CHUCKLES)

46:37.800 --> 46:40.560
I'm sorry
you're having such a shit night.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.520
Not as shit as my brother's.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.520
You enjoy making enemies, Snap?

46:49.680 --> 46:53.000
I certainly seem
to be getting some practice at it.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.760
Well, you should learn
to not shit in your own nest.

46:55.760 --> 46:57.760
It's Trotter that started that one.

46:58.760 --> 46:59.760
Oh, my gosh.

46:59.760 --> 47:02.480
You two stole all of my contacts

47:02.480 --> 47:05.040
and you went into business
without me.

47:06.040 --> 47:11.000
And YOU used the money
I gave you to marry that prick.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.680
He's not a prick.

47:12.680 --> 47:14.160
He's acting like one.

47:14.160 --> 47:15.760
That makes two of you.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.000
How would you like me to act?

47:20.600 --> 47:22.400
YOU dumped ME, remember?

47:22.400 --> 47:25.080
Because you were fucking around
the whole time.

47:25.080 --> 47:27.360
So, Trotter's the next best bet,
is he?

47:27.360 --> 47:29.520
Get over it, Snap.

47:30.680 --> 47:33.520
Trotter had the balls to ask me out,
and I liked him.

47:33.520 --> 47:36.240
Liked him so much I married him.

47:44.520 --> 47:46.720
What about Dimma?

47:46.720 --> 47:49.320
He's a good kid. (CLEARS THROAT)

47:49.320 --> 47:51.240
He was,

47:51.240 --> 47:53.560
until you took him
on one of your Bali runs.

47:53.560 --> 47:56.160
He had shit luck, that's all.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.120
Did you know
he was carrying the drugs?

48:04.960 --> 48:07.520
He's falling apart in there.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.720
His life's ruined.
I didn't know he was carrying.

48:11.720 --> 48:14.440
Oh, Snapper. (SCOFFS)

48:17.840 --> 48:19.000
Sure.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.640
Whatever gets you through the night.

48:33.480 --> 48:36.040
I didn't think it'd be like this.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.800
Like what?

48:42.800 --> 48:44.760
All of it.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.200
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

49:39.560 --> 49:43.200
(WIND GUSTS)

49:43.200 --> 49:44.800
Yes?

49:46.600 --> 49:50.120
Uh... I just wanted to say that...

49:51.520 --> 49:53.560
..you were right.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.840
About what?

49:56.840 --> 49:58.880
I fucked up.

49:59.880 --> 50:01.360
Everything.

50:01.360 --> 50:03.000
Uh...

50:03.000 --> 50:05.200
But especially with Dim.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.440
I never should've taken him.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.440
He looked up to you.

50:17.400 --> 50:18.920
I know.

50:20.320 --> 50:22.600
And I'm gonna make it up to him.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.400
I promise.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.920
You can try.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.120
(SNIFFLES)

50:40.880 --> 50:42.600
Can I come in?

50:49.160 --> 50:50.840
'Night, Snapper.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.680
Happy birthday.

51:15.320 --> 51:18.320
(WAVES CRASH)

51:23.840 --> 51:26.000
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

51:26.000 --> 51:27.280
CHOC: Hey, Miss?

51:40.680 --> 51:42.560
Well, Hunter knows the scene
over there,

51:42.560 --> 51:45.760
so better him taking our stuff
and speaking their language

51:45.760 --> 51:48.120
while we are building Australia.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.560
And Buddy?

51:49.560 --> 51:51.000
Buddy'll be the face.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.480
Turns out no-one's
that interested in this one.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.520
(BIRD SQUAWKS)

51:55.520 --> 51:58.680
Look...I know it didn't happen
the way I said it would,

51:58.680 --> 52:01.160
but it's going to, OK?

52:01.160 --> 52:04.400
I got a feel for it,
we know what we're doing,

52:04.400 --> 52:06.680
and that includes you.

52:07.960 --> 52:11.040
I haven't forgiven you
for not calling me on my birthday.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.560
You want me to describe the vomit

52:12.560 --> 52:14.840
on that Mexican phone again?
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm!

52:14.840 --> 52:17.000
I know you made that up, Trot,
because you know me.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.880
I didn't even ask. Um...
How was your night?

52:19.880 --> 52:22.720
What did you do? Who'd you see?

52:23.800 --> 52:26.120
Just Dad. Nothing special.

52:27.120 --> 52:29.600
Yeah?
Mm.

52:32.320 --> 52:33.840
We're gonna be rich.

52:33.840 --> 52:36.240
I told you.

52:54.760 --> 52:58.000
Yeah, I'm running a school here,
not a halfway house.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.680
TRACY: Dimma, stop!

52:59.680 --> 53:01.520
Was I the last guy you had sex with?

53:01.520 --> 53:03.200
Will you marry me?

53:03.200 --> 53:05.160
It's my engagement party!

53:05.160 --> 53:06.160
Boom!

53:06.160 --> 53:08.040
I got an audition with Joseph Deluca.

53:08.040 --> 53:09.640
Warren wants her in the picture.

53:09.640 --> 53:10.640
Hey, Bud.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.440
What's your PhD?

53:12.440 --> 53:14.560
Feminist separatism
and institutional misogyny.

53:14.560 --> 53:15.560
Eh?

53:15.560 --> 53:17.360
You owe me a US licence fee.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.280
We're in the middle of an important
meeting about this right now.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.760
We're expanding the business.
Into what?

53:22.760 --> 53:24.760
I have missed you, Trot.
