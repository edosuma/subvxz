WEBVTT

00:25.166 --> 00:26.500
HEY...

00:26.500 --> 00:27.708
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

00:27.708 --> 00:31.792
AS SURE AS I'VE EVER BEEN
ABOUT ANYTHING
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

00:31.792 --> 00:32.917
GROOVY.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.667
CUT!

01:06.667 --> 01:09.208
EXCUSE ME, ANDREW.
MUST BE MY TRICK EAR.

01:09.208 --> 01:10.708
DID YOU JUST YELL CUT?

01:10.708 --> 01:13.000
YELLING CUT IS ONE
OF THE FEW BRIGHT SPOTS

01:13.000 --> 01:15.375
IN AN OTHERWISE
BLEAK EXISTENCE,

01:15.375 --> 01:19.208
AND I WILL NOT ALLOW
SOME HACK STUNTMAN
TO DENY ME THE PLEASURE.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.000
YOU DO NOT BREAK CHARACTER
UNTIL I YELL CUT.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.500
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
YEAH.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.458
GOOD.

01:27.792 --> 01:28.917
THAT WAS FUN.

01:28.917 --> 01:31.250
SOMETIMES I FORGET HOW MUCH
I LIKE YELLING AT PEOPLE.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.417
YOU'RE A SICK MAN,
TODD CARR.

01:33.417 --> 01:34.625
GREAT. NOW I'M NOT
GONNA MAKE MY DAY.

01:34.625 --> 01:37.041
THIS IS WHAT I GET
FOR SHOOTING ON A BLOODY
HAUNTED SOUNDSTAGE

01:37.041 --> 01:38.208
THE DAY BEFORE
BLOODY HALLOWEEN.

01:38.208 --> 01:39.792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HAUNTED?

01:39.792 --> 01:41.583
YOU DON'T KNOW?
WHAT?

01:41.583 --> 01:44.083
ABOUT THE BIRD WHO DIED HERE--
MELANIE RAY?

01:44.083 --> 01:45.583
YOU'VE HEARD
OF MELANIE RAY?
NO.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.041
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF
A FILM GEEK.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.125
SHAME ON YOU, LEERY.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.750
YOU'VE HEARD OF MELANIE RAY,
RIGHT, DARLING?

01:50.750 --> 01:51.750
OF COURSE.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.417
MELANIE RAY
WAS THE JAMIE LEE CURTIS
OF HER DAY.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.583
THE ORIGINAL SCREAM QUEEN.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.375
SHE WAS SHOOTING
THIS B-MOVIE HERE IN BOSTON.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.041
WHAT WAS IT CALLED AGAIN?

01:58.041 --> 01:59.250
UH, KISS THE GIRLS
AND MAKE THEM DIE.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.959
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY SHOT IT RIGHT HERE
BACK IN THE FIFTIES.

02:01.959 --> 02:05.083
AND YOUNG MELANIE WAS HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH HER DIRECTOR.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.917
(SIGHS)

02:07.917 --> 02:09.083
WHERE WAS I?

02:09.083 --> 02:10.458
AHEM. UH, AFFAIR
WITH THE DIRECTOR.

02:10.458 --> 02:12.250
OH, RIGHT. YEAH. ANYWAY,
IT WAS ALL COMPLICATED

02:12.250 --> 02:15.625
BY THE FACT THAT MELANIE
WAS MARRIED TO HER COSTAR
NICK MARCH.

02:15.625 --> 02:18.750
AND WHEN NICK FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE AFFAIR, HE WENT
FRIGGING BALLISTIC.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.917
THEY WERE DOING THIS SCENE
WHERE THE 2 CHARACTERS
HAD TO GET INTO A FIGHT.

02:21.917 --> 02:23.708
HE STRANGLED HER...

02:24.458 --> 02:26.625
TO DEATH.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.083
THAT SUCKS.

02:28.083 --> 02:32.875
THAT'S WHY THEY SAY
HER SPIRIT STILL HAUNTS
THE SOUNDSTAGE TO THIS DAY.

02:32.875 --> 02:35.333
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN THAT SORT OF THING.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.458
THEY'RE READY FOR YOU,
NATASHA.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.083
WHAT?

02:41.083 --> 02:42.792
NOTHING.

02:42.792 --> 02:45.291
WHAT?

02:45.291 --> 02:47.000
IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.917
LEERY, MY BOY,
I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO

02:49.917 --> 02:51.542
NOT TO SCREW AROUND
WITH MY LEADING LADIES.

02:51.542 --> 02:53.333
THAT'S WHAT EXTRAS ARE FOR.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.500
BUT IF I WAS GONNA UNLEARN
THAT PARTICULAR LESSON,

02:56.500 --> 02:59.000
THE LOVELY NATASHA WOULD BE
THE ONE TO DO IT WITH.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.834
RIGHT, WHILE I STILL HAVE
MY HAIR, PEOPLE,

03:00.834 --> 03:03.458
ENERGY UP. CAMERA.

03:03.458 --> 03:04.166
Associate Director:
MARKER.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.208
AND...ACTION.

04:07.750 --> 04:08.834
Actor, on tape:
HEY...

04:08.834 --> 04:10.583
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

04:10.583 --> 04:11.875
Natasha, on tape:
AS SURE AS I'VE EVER BEEN
ABOUT ANYTHING

04:11.875 --> 04:13.417
IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.

04:13.417 --> 04:16.458
BOY, EH,
HOW'S MY PARTY COMING?

04:16.458 --> 04:19.291
I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE
THE ART DEPARTMENT'S
TURNED STAGE 7

04:19.291 --> 04:21.041
INTO A PLAYGROUND
FOR THE MORALLY IMPAIRED.

04:21.041 --> 04:24.208
OH, EXCELLENT.
I LOVE HALLOWEEN.

04:24.208 --> 04:26.083
MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY.
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.125
YEAH. MINE, TOO.
ACTUALLY I'M KINDA FAMOUS

04:28.125 --> 04:30.083
FOR PLAYING THESE ELABORATE
PRANKS ON MY FRIENDS BACK HOME.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.458
GOOD FOR YOU, GILLIGAN.
HOW'S MY COSTUME COMING?

04:32.458 --> 04:34.083
PICKING IT UP FROM WARDROBE
RIGHT AFTER THIS.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.542
AM I GONNA LOOK
LIKE A STUD?

04:35.542 --> 04:37.375
IS THERE ANY DOUBT?

04:37.375 --> 04:40.083
BUT WILL IT
GET ME LAID, DAWSON?
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.083
TELL YOU WHAT. IF YOU
CAN'T CLOSE THE DEAL,

04:42.083 --> 04:45.583
I'LL HAVE A FEW EXTRAS
LINED UP FOR YOU.

04:45.583 --> 04:48.375
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I
LIKE ABOUT YOU, LEERY.
ALWAYS THINKING AHEAD.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.417
Todd, on tape: CAMERA. ACTION.

04:50.417 --> 04:53.917
GENTLEMEN, NATASHA
LOOKS SO HOT
IN THESE DAILIES,

04:53.917 --> 04:55.583
I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU ALL
TO LEAVE THE ROOM

04:55.583 --> 04:57.250
SO I CAN BE ALONE
WITH MYSELF. DO YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

04:58.417 --> 05:01.166
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
NOTHING.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.667
YOU'RE A BIT TERRITORIAL
ABOUT THE LOVELY NATASHA,
AREN'T YOU, LEERY?

05:03.667 --> 05:04.917
NO.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.375
GOOD. BECAUSE YOU
SHOULDN'T BE.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.917
YOU DUMPED HER,
REMEMBER?

05:07.917 --> 05:09.083
FOR THE PRISSY ONE.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.166
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE, TODD.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.667
SURE IT WAS.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.625
YOUR PUNY
LITTLE MIND COULDN'T
PROCESS THE FACT

05:13.625 --> 05:15.166
THAT YOU WERE SHAGGING

05:15.166 --> 05:16.792
ONE OF THE HOTTEST
YOUNG STARLETS HOLLYWOOD
HAS TO OFFER,

05:16.792 --> 05:19.083
SO YOU JACKED IT
ALL IN FOR ANOTHER GO
AT YOUR PROM DATE.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.959
SHE WASN'T MY PROM DATE.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.625
(TODD CHUCKLES)

05:22.625 --> 05:25.208
IT WAS--IT WAS JUNIOR PROM.
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.667
DOESN'T COUNT.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.583
HEY, TODD, YOU SHOULD
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.667
WHAT IS THAT?

05:44.667 --> 05:46.667
IS THIS A JOKE?

05:46.667 --> 05:48.041
THIS IS WHAT
WE GOT BACK
FROM THE LAB.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.458
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
SOMEONE'S SCREWING WITH ME.

05:50.458 --> 05:54.083
IS THIS ONE OF THOSE
PRACTICAL JOKES YOU CLAIM
TO BE FAMOUS FOR?

05:54.083 --> 05:55.208
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:55.208 --> 05:56.458
REMEMBER
THAT LITTLE STORY

05:56.458 --> 05:57.875
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT YESTERDAY?

05:57.875 --> 05:58.875
ABOUT THE ACTRESS
WHO DIED ON STAGE 7?

05:58.875 --> 06:00.000
YEAH.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.166
THAT'S HER.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.417
WHAT IS SHE DOING
IN OUR DAILIES?

06:07.667 --> 06:09.291
I HAVE NO IDEA.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.792
SID!

06:23.208 --> 06:26.875
OOH, BABY!
YOU LOOK AWESOME!

06:26.875 --> 06:28.041
BUT...

06:28.041 --> 06:29.250
BUT WHAT?

06:29.250 --> 06:31.250
WELL, DON'T SHOOT
THE MESSENGER HERE,

06:31.250 --> 06:32.875
BUT IF WE'RE GOING
FOR AUTHENTICITY,

06:32.875 --> 06:34.708
LEATHER PANTS
WOULD REALLY DO THE TRICK.

06:34.708 --> 06:36.208
FRANKLY, IT'S
A MIRACLE THAT I'M
EVEN GOING ALONG

06:36.208 --> 06:37.959
WITH THIS WHOLE
SID AND NANCY THING.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.875
HEY, YOU PROMISED
NOT TO BE CRANKY TONIGHT.

06:39.875 --> 06:44.083
SORRY. I'M JUST NOT
REALLY A COSTUME PARTY
KIND OF GUY.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.041
SEEM TO LOVE PUTTING ON
THAT LITTLE MONKEY SUIT
OF YOURS EVERY MORNING.

06:46.041 --> 06:47.375
EASY.

06:47.375 --> 06:49.250
ALL RIGHT. SORRY.
LOW BLOW.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.375
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GET
INTO YET ANOTHER TIFF

06:51.375 --> 06:53.542
ABOUT OUR EVER-WIDENING
IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.

06:53.542 --> 06:54.875
I'LL BE READY IN A SECOND.

06:54.875 --> 06:55.834
OK.

07:10.583 --> 07:11.625
YOU READY?

07:12.917 --> 07:14.125
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:14.125 --> 07:16.166
NOTHING.
LET'S GO.

07:16.166 --> 07:17.333
OK.
YEAH.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.000
I'M TELLING YOU,
JUST CALL THE GUY.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.250
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S TOO LATE.

07:24.250 --> 07:27.583
THE MINUSCULE WINDOW OF
OPPORTUNITY THAT ONCE WAS
HAS OFFICIALLY CLOSED.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.583
YEAH, BUT YOU
LIKE THE GUY.
I CAN TELL.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.375
WHICH GUY IS THIS?

07:31.375 --> 07:32.750
C.J.
STRAPPING YOUNG LAD.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.375
I SEE.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.166
I THINK THAT MAYBE
THE THING TO DO HERE, JACK,

07:36.166 --> 07:37.917
IS TO JUST CRUSH FROM AFAR.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.667
THAT WAY THERE
ARE NO BROKEN HEARTS,
THERE ARE NO DASHED DREAMS,

07:40.667 --> 07:43.000
THERE ARE NO MORNING-AFTER PILLS
TO CONTEND WITH.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
THE GIRL'S GOT A POINT.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.625
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

07:45.625 --> 07:46.917
SHE'S JUST AFRAID
THIS GUY IS TOO GOOD
FOR HER.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.041
AND SHE'S WRONG
ABOUT THAT.

07:51.041 --> 07:53.458
UH, NO. HE'S PROBABLY
WORKING RIGHT NOW,

07:53.458 --> 07:55.041
DOING GOOD FOR OTHERS
AND WHATNOT,

07:55.041 --> 07:58.792
WHICH IS ANNOYING,
BUT UNDENIABLY CHARMING.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.458
DIAL.

08:00.458 --> 08:01.667
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW
HIS NUMBER.

08:01.667 --> 08:02.834
CALL THE HELP LINE.

08:02.834 --> 08:03.917
NO. DOESN'T THAT SEEM WRONG?

08:03.917 --> 08:04.959
JUST DO IT.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.000
ARRR!

08:10.291 --> 08:12.125
HELP LINE.
HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.959
UM, HI. IS C.J. THERE?

08:13.959 --> 08:15.125
SPEAKING.

08:15.125 --> 08:17.125
OH. HI.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.291
UH, THIS IS JEN.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.166
LINDLEY. DO YOU--
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

08:22.166 --> 08:24.166
HELLO, JEN LINDLEY.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.000
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.333
WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT YOU WERE DOING TONIGHT.

08:28.333 --> 08:32.166
UM, BUT YOU'RE WORKING,
AREN'T YOU?

08:32.166 --> 08:34.041
UH, YEAH, FOR JUST,
LIKE, ANOTHER HOUR.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.082
I'M FILLING IN
FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S
RUNNING LATE.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.166
OH, WELL--I MEAN,

08:38.166 --> 08:40.207
DO YOU HAVE PLANS
AFTER THAT OR--

08:40.207 --> 08:41.500
WELL, IF...
GOING BACK TO MY ROOM

08:41.500 --> 08:45.083
AND WATCHING HALLOWEEN H20
ON CABLE QUALIFIES AS PLANS,

08:45.083 --> 08:46.083
THEN YEAH,
I'M ALL BOOKED UP.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.667
OH...WELL,

08:48.667 --> 08:50.208
DO YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST
IN COMING TO A PARTY?

08:50.208 --> 08:52.333
C.J.: WITH YOU?
ALONE?

08:52.333 --> 08:55.375
WELL, NO. I MEAN,
I'LL BE THERE,

08:55.375 --> 08:57.708
BUT MY FRIENDS
ARE COMING, TOO.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.166
C.J.: HMM, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.166
WAIT A SECOND, DID YOU
JUST CALL THE HELP LINE
TO INVITE ME TO A PARTY?

09:02.166 --> 09:04.625
YEAH. IS THAT WRONG?

09:06.083 --> 09:07.333
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

09:12.708 --> 09:13.708
GOOD NEWS.

09:13.708 --> 09:14.708
WHAT?

09:14.708 --> 09:16.333
YOU CAN COME BACK
TO CLASS.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.208
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.208
I TALKED HETSON INTO
LETTING YOU COME BACK.

09:20.208 --> 09:23.000
I MADE A DEAL WITH HIM.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.375
YOU TALKED TO HETSON
ABOUT ME?

09:24.375 --> 09:25.875
YEAH.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.208
UH-HUH.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.166
WHICH WAS CLEARLY
A MISTAKE.

09:29.166 --> 09:30.375
MY BAD.

09:32.375 --> 09:34.708
WHOEVER SAID I WANTED
TO COME BACK TO CLASS?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.834
YOU SEEMED TO GO
THROUGH A LOT
OF TROUBLE TO ATTEND

09:36.834 --> 09:39.041
SO I JUST--I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT'VE MEANT
SOMETHING TO YOU,

09:39.041 --> 09:40.708
BUT AGAIN, SORRY.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.375
UHH!

09:44.375 --> 09:45.917
COULD YOU MAYBE
WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE GOING?

09:45.917 --> 09:47.667
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

09:47.667 --> 09:49.375
THAT'D BE NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.542
JUST TELL ME WHERE
CAN I FIND SOME GIRL

09:51.542 --> 09:53.333
WITH THE UNFORTUNATE
NAME OF JOEY.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.625
OH, I SEE YOU TWO
HAVE ALREADY MET.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.542
THIS IS YOUR DAUGHTER?

09:57.542 --> 09:59.917
MEET MY DAUGHTER HARLEY.
HARLEY, THIS IS JOEY POTTER.

09:59.917 --> 10:02.792
(SCOFFS) HI.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.208
WHAT?

10:05.208 --> 10:06.375
I THOUGHT SHE WAS 5.

10:06.375 --> 10:07.542
WHATEVER GAVE YOU
THAT IDEA?

10:07.542 --> 10:09.125
THE PICTURE ON YOUR DESK.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.583
WELL, SHE WAS 5 WHEN
THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.208
THAT'S FALSE ADVERTISING.

10:13.208 --> 10:14.625
AW, JEEZ, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THE TIME?

10:14.625 --> 10:16.708
I'LL PICK
THE LITTLE ANGEL UP
AT 11:00. HAVE FUN.

10:16.708 --> 10:19.083
AND--WELL,
THANKS AGAIN, JOEY.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.875
BYE, SWEETIE.

10:20.875 --> 10:24.291
DAD! I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
ONE MORE CHANCE HERE
NOT TO BAIL ON ME.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.625
(SIGHS) SWEETIE,
I'M NOT BAILING ON YOU.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.667
NO. YOU'RE
FOREGOING TRADITION,
OUR TRADITION.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.375
TO GO OUT
WITH SOME SKANK.

10:32.375 --> 10:35.125
A--SHE'S NOT A BAD KIND
OF SKANK, AND B--WE'LL GO TO
THE MOVIES TOMORROW NIGHT.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.458
IT'S NOT THE SAME!

10:36.458 --> 10:38.208
WE GO TO THE MOVIES
ON HALLOWEEN.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.125
WE GO SEE SOME SCARY
OLD MOVIE AT THE CREST.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.500
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.375
Hetson: HARLEY, YOU GOTTA
GIVE ME A BREAK HERE.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.917
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU,
I PROMISE, OK?

10:54.125 --> 10:55.583
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

11:14.708 --> 11:15.875
Voice, whispering:
Dawson.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.000
(BAND PLAYS)

12:22.708 --> 12:24.792
TODD! CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

12:24.792 --> 12:27.000
ABSOLUTELY NOT, LEERY.
I'M BUSY.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.375
TODD, I'M SERIOUS.
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

12:29.375 --> 12:32.542
WOULD YOU 2 BEAUTIFUL LADIES
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE?

12:32.542 --> 12:33.750
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.875
ALL RIGHT,
YOU BETTER BE DYING.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.125
I SAW HER.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.417
WHO?
HER.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.583
MELANIE RAY.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.250
YOU'RE SCREWING
WITH ME.
I'M NOT.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.250
I SAW HER.
WHERE?

12:44.250 --> 12:45.417
IN HERE, ON STAGE.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.375
WELL, YOU LIKE.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.708
YOU PROBABLY SAW SOMEONE
DRESSED UP LIKE HER.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.250
IT'S A FRIGGING
COSTUME PARTY, LEERY.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.417
THIS WAS HOURS AGO,
BEFORE ANYBODY EVEN GOT THERE.

12:51.417 --> 12:52.750
COME ON, MATE.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.708
YOUR MIND'S PLAYING
TRICKS ON YOU.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.417
TAKE THE NIGHT OFF.
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

12:56.417 --> 12:57.750
KNOCK BACK SOME
BYE-BYE-PAIN JUICE.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.917
SADDLE UP WITH
A COUPLE OF BIRDS.

13:03.417 --> 13:06.041
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.083
HELLO, BOYS.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.250
HI.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.291
Todd: YOU WANNA DANCE,
DARLING?

13:13.291 --> 13:15.250
LOVE TO.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.166
YEAH.

13:22.458 --> 13:24.250
DO YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND, EDDIE?

13:24.250 --> 13:26.250
I MOST CERTAINLY DO NOT.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.625
OH, WELL, HOW COME?

13:27.625 --> 13:29.250
WELL, I'VE FOUND
THAT GIRLFRIENDS

13:29.250 --> 13:30.291
ARE GENERALLY MORE TROUBLE
THAN THEY'RE WORTH.

13:30.291 --> 13:33.125
WELL, THAT SEEMS
LIKE A TOTAL WASTE,
IF YOU ASK ME.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.792
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

13:34.792 --> 13:37.417
I'VE FOUND THAT AGE
IS BUT A NUMBER, EDDIE.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.792
ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO,
BREAK IT UP.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.625
YOU READY TO HAVE
SOME FUN, HARLEY?

13:40.625 --> 13:42.750
AND WHERE IS THIS FUN
YOU SPEAK OF?

13:42.750 --> 13:44.291
WELL, I WAS GOING TO
TAKE YOU TRICK OR TREATING,

13:44.291 --> 13:46.125
BUT THAT WAS WHEN
I THOUGHT YOU WERE 5.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.834
SO I WAS THINKING
WE COULD GO TO THE MOVIES
OR SOMETHING.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.959
I HEARD YOU SAY
SOMETHING TO YOUR DAD
ABOUT WANTING TO SEE--

13:49.959 --> 13:51.250
THAT SOUNDS LAME.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.959
I WANT TO STAY HERE.

13:52.959 --> 13:55.667
WELL, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
TAKING CARE OF YOU,

13:55.667 --> 13:58.333
AND I DON'T THINK YOUR DAD
WOULD WANT YOU HANGING OUT IN
SOME COLLEGE BAR ALL NIGHT.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.959
TRUST ME.
HE WOULDN'T CARE.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.333
OK, LOOK,
YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEBODY

14:02.333 --> 14:04.208
WHO COULD HOST A DAYTIME
TALK SHOW ON DEADBEAT DADS,

14:04.208 --> 14:05.708
SO LET'S NOT GO THERE.

14:05.708 --> 14:07.291
COME ON,
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

14:07.291 --> 14:11.166
NO! YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE ME GO ANYWHERE
I DON'T WANNA GO.

14:11.166 --> 14:13.500
I'M GONNA STAY
RIGHT HERE UNTIL
MY FATHER GETS BACK.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.333
HEY, YOU KNOW, I READ
ABOUT THIS HAUNTED HOUSE
IN THE PAPER TODAY.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.000
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
PRETTY SCARY.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.500
I LOVE HAUNTED HOUSES.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.333
YEAH, MAYBE YOU GUYS
COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.959
WELL, I'LL GO
IF YOU GO.

14:22.959 --> 14:23.959
EDDIE'S WORKING.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.417
OFF IN 5, ACTUALLY.

14:25.417 --> 14:26.500
WELL, I'M SURE HE HAS PLANS.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.792
NOT PARTICULARLY, NO.

14:29.792 --> 14:33.166
WELL, THEN, BY ALL MEANS,
PLEASE JOIN US.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.834
Harley: COOL.
COOL.

14:38.917 --> 14:40.333
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.083
I WAS HANDLING IT.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.208
YEAH. YOU WERE DOING
JUST SWELL.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.708
IT SUCKS WHEN PEOPLE BUTT
INTO YOUR BUSINESS, DON'T IT?

14:48.208 --> 14:51.291
JEN, DID YOU TELL C.J.
IT WAS A COSTUME PARTY?

14:51.291 --> 14:54.792
YEAH. YEAH, I THINK SO.
GOD, I HOPE SO. WHY?

14:54.792 --> 14:56.667
AHEM. CHECK IT OUT.

14:59.875 --> 15:02.041
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME
IT WAS A COSTUME PARTY.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.208
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.583
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A DORK.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.375
AND YOU ARE?

15:07.375 --> 15:08.917
SORRY.
THIS IS DAVID.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.417
HI, I'M JEN.

15:10.417 --> 15:12.208
HI.
THIS IS JACK.

15:12.208 --> 15:14.166
HEY, DAVID.
HEY.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.708
SO, WE'RE GONNA GO
GRAB SOME REFRESHMENTS.
YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING?

15:16.708 --> 15:17.708
COOL.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.750
FINE.

15:22.250 --> 15:27.250
OH, MY GOD!
I AM LIKE FLYPAPER FOR
THE HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.208
YEAH. WHAT?

15:29.208 --> 15:32.250
HE'S OBVIOUSLY GAY.
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.959
WHO, C.J.?

15:33.959 --> 15:35.708
IT FIGURES. I INVITE
A BOY TO A PARTY,

15:35.708 --> 15:37.208
AND HE BRINGS HIS BOYFRIEND.

15:37.208 --> 15:38.208
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
THEY'RE A COUPLE?

15:38.208 --> 15:40.125
WHATEVER.
EVEN IF HE'S STRAIGHT,

15:40.125 --> 15:43.875
I CAN'T TAKE THIS C.J. ANYMORE.
HE'S WAY TOO STANDOFFISH.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.917
WHEN I MAKE
MY INTENTIONS CLEAR,

15:45.917 --> 15:47.959
I WANT THEM TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED
AND RECIPROCATED.

15:47.959 --> 15:48.708
IN THAT ORDER.

15:48.708 --> 15:51.041
I HEAR YA.
I HEAR YA.
ALL RIGHT.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.083
WE'RE GONNA DELVE
A LITTLE DEEPER
INTO THIS, OK?

15:53.083 --> 15:54.625
I'M GONNA TAKE C.J.,

15:54.625 --> 15:56.959
AND YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE THE "ALLEGED"
HOMOSEXUAL,

15:56.959 --> 15:58.250
AND WE'RE GONNA
MEET BACK HERE
IN A LITTLE BIT.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.250
DEAL.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.333
BREAK!
BREAK.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.000
AAH!

16:17.417 --> 16:19.917
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE SO RETARDED.

16:19.917 --> 16:22.000
WHO ASKED YOU,
YOU LITTLE TWERP?

16:24.291 --> 16:27.500
HEY, GO EASY
ON THE POOR KID.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.708
OK? SHE'S GOT PROBLEMS.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.458
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

16:33.458 --> 16:36.208
COME ON, IT'S OBVIOUS
THE GIRL HAS SOME ISSUES
WITH HER FATHER.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.750
DON'T WE ALL?

16:39.750 --> 16:41.625
HEY, UH, LOOK,

16:41.625 --> 16:44.792
I'M SORRY ABOUT
BUTTING INTO YOUR LIFE
AND ALL THAT.

16:44.792 --> 16:47.542
I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY
TO HELP, AND I
WENT FOR IT.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.834
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'RE REALLY SMART.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.625
YOU'RE A LOT SMARTER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE
IN THAT CLASS.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.834
AND IT JUST
MAKES ME SAD

16:53.834 --> 16:55.834
TO SEE ALL
OF THAT POTENTIAL
JUST GOING TO WASTE.

16:55.834 --> 16:58.458
WHAT POTENTIAL?
WHAT--WHAT WASTE?

16:58.458 --> 16:59.834
LOOK, I LIKE TO READ BOOKS.

16:59.834 --> 17:02.834
BIG DEAL. WHAT, MY LIFE
WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER
IF I WENT TO COLLEGE?

17:02.834 --> 17:04.250
AND, UH...

17:04.250 --> 17:05.708
WHAT?

17:05.708 --> 17:07.500
I DON'T NEED YOUR PITY.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.666
AND I DON'T NEED TO BE
SOME RICH KID'S CHARITY CASE.

17:10.666 --> 17:12.416
YOU THINK
I'M A RICH KID?

17:14.333 --> 17:15.250
WOW.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.500
WHAT?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.333
IT'S JUST FUNNY...

17:18.333 --> 17:20.791
HOW LITTLE YOU
ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT ME.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.333
YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN FUNNIER?

17:22.333 --> 17:25.416
ALL OF THIS COULD'VE BEEN
SO EASILY AVOIDED.

17:25.416 --> 17:28.208
I MEAN, I WASN'T EVEN
GONNA COME BACK
TO HETSON'S CLASS.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.542
I MEAN, HE'S TOO CYNICAL,
HE'S TOO IMPRESSED WITH HIMSELF.

17:30.542 --> 17:33.000
SO WHY DID YOU
COME BACK?

17:33.000 --> 17:33.917
YOU.

17:35.041 --> 17:37.875
YOU, UH, YOU GOT
UNDER MY SKIN.

17:37.875 --> 17:41.041
I FOUND MYSELF
HAVING THESE SERIES

17:41.041 --> 17:43.375
OF ANNOYING CONVERSATIONS
WITH YOU IN MY HEAD,

17:43.375 --> 17:46.750
WHICH MUST BE A SIGN
OF SOMETHING, SO I KEPT
COMING BACK FOR MORE,

17:46.750 --> 17:49.792
WHICH ULTIMATELY PROVED
TO BE MY UNDOING.

17:51.417 --> 17:52.875
AAH!

17:54.041 --> 17:55.917
MAN, YOU'RE SUCH
A SCAREDY CAT.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.250
THAT'S WHAT
THEY TELL ME.

18:01.750 --> 18:03.959
COULD YOU LET ME GO NOW?

18:05.458 --> 18:07.041
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:08.208 --> 18:10.083
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.375
OH, CRAP.
WHAT?

18:19.375 --> 18:20.834
HARLEY.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.417
WOW! I'VE DIED
AND GONE TO HELL!

18:40.417 --> 18:41.875
HAIL, SATAN!

18:41.875 --> 18:44.125
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I FEEL VERY OLD.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.542
OH, PACEY,
COME DANCE WITH ME.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.417
DANCE? WHERE?

18:46.417 --> 18:48.125
OVER THERE.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.250
THAT'S NOT DANCING.
THAT'S CAVORTING.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.458
OH, WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SUCH A DULL NORMAL?

18:52.458 --> 18:54.959
ABOUT THE SAME TIME
YOU STARTED
FAILING TESTS.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.625
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

18:56.625 --> 18:58.458
WHAT? COME ON,
WHAT'S WITH THE "F,"
AUDREY?

18:58.458 --> 18:59.959
IT'S A LETTER GRADE, PACEY.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.333
IT'S TYPICALLY GIVEN
WHEN A STUDENT

19:01.333 --> 19:03.458
FAILS TO MEET
THE REQUIREMENTS
OF AN ASSIGNMENT.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.250
THANKS, WISE ASS.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.792
I'M JUST ASKING
IF EVERYTHING'S OK.

19:06.792 --> 19:08.500
I GOT IT TOTALLY
UNDER CONTROL, BABY.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.166
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW
IN MY EXPERIENCE,

19:10.166 --> 19:11.000
THERE'S NEVER
JUST ONE "F."

19:11.000 --> 19:13.250
THOSE THINGS TEND
TO COME IN BUNCHES.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.625
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE A REALLY GOOD IDEA.
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THIS.

19:15.625 --> 19:18.291
OK, FINE. I'M JUST
LETTING YOU KNOW
I'M WORRIED. THAT'S ALL.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.625
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT REALLY
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU ARE.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.792
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE TOO BUSY

19:20.792 --> 19:22.291
RUNNING AROUND
LIKE GLENGARRY GLEN LOSER

19:22.291 --> 19:24.000
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT MUCH
OF ANYTHING THESE DAYS.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.041
THAT'S NICE OF YOU.
TAKE A SWING AT ME

19:25.041 --> 19:26.792
BECAUSE I GOTTA WORK
FOR A LIVING.
THAT'S GREAT.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.500
I DON'T MIND THAT YOU HAVE
TO WORK FOR A LIVING, PACEY.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.667
I'M JUST SAYING DON'T LOSE
YOURSELF IN IT. THAT'S ALL.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.000
WHY ARE WE BICKERING
ABOUT THIS?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.667
I JUST WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.333
OK. YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH ME? HERE GOES.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.834
I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN GOING TO
CLASS MUCH THIS SEMESTER, PACEY.

19:39.834 --> 19:42.875
WHY IS THAT? YOU MIGHT ASK.
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN KINDA
DEPRESSED.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.667
YEAH, YOU SEE,
I HAVE THIS BOYFRIEND,

19:44.667 --> 19:47.333
AND I THOUGHT
EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT,
BUT APPARENTLY IT'S NOT.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.291
APPARENTLY, HE CARES
ABOUT HIS JOB MORE THAN
HE CARES ABOUT ME,

19:49.291 --> 19:51.500
AND I KNOW HE WOULD PROBABLY
SAY THAT WASN'T TRUE

19:51.500 --> 19:53.667
AND THAT I'M JUST BEING SOME
HYSTERICAL DRAMA QUEEN,

19:53.667 --> 19:56.500
BUT I SUPPOSE IF IT
WASN'T TRUE, HE'D PRETTY
MUCH KNOW EVERYTHING

19:56.500 --> 19:58.208
THAT WAS GOING ON IN MY LIFE,
WOULDN'T HE, PACEY?

20:00.041 --> 20:01.667
HEY, GUYS.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.208
LOVE THE COSTUMES.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.875
NO, I'M NOT
THE DIRECTOR.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.208
I'M THE DIRECTOR'S
ASSISTANT.

20:18.208 --> 20:20.291
REALLY?
THAT'S AWESOME!

20:21.417 --> 20:22.625
YEAH.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.125
ARE YOU OK?

20:41.125 --> 20:43.166
CAN YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SEC?

21:55.625 --> 21:56.792
Todd: RIGHT.
(LAUGHS)

21:56.792 --> 21:59.250
Natasha: I WAS THINKING
ABOUT NEAR THE END.
WELL, SO...

22:00.500 --> 22:02.083
WHAT'S WRONG, DAWSON?

22:02.083 --> 22:06.208
NOTHING. UH, I WAS JUST,
UH, LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.417
SO...

22:09.417 --> 22:11.625
SO, I MEAN 60 MILLION PEOPLE
ARE WATCHING IT.

22:11.625 --> 22:12.834
RIGHT.

22:12.834 --> 22:14.417
AND THAT'S
4 TIMES AS MANY.

22:17.208 --> 22:19.375
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

22:21.667 --> 22:22.500
HELLO.

22:24.333 --> 22:25.458
I WAS GETTING READY
TO LEAVE FOR THE PARTY

22:25.458 --> 22:27.458
WHEN A NEW BATCH
OF DAILIES CAME IN.

22:27.458 --> 22:30.417
I GO TO DIGITIZE THEM,
AND THIS IS WHAT SHOWED UP.

23:45.542 --> 23:46.542
HEY, YOU.

23:46.542 --> 23:48.291
HEY.

23:48.291 --> 23:49.417
HEY.

23:49.417 --> 23:52.417
YOU--YOU LOOK
AMAZING.

23:52.417 --> 23:54.917
I'M SURE YOU'VE
PROBABLY HEARD THAT,
LIKE, 1,000 TIMES.

23:54.917 --> 23:57.917
YEAH, I'VE GOTTEN A COUPLE
MARRIAGE PROPOSALS

23:57.917 --> 24:01.083
AND ONE GUY SAID
HE'D SIGN OVER HIS CAR
IF I SLEPT WITH HIM, BUT...

24:01.083 --> 24:02.542
THANKS,
IT NEVER GETS OLD.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.250
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

24:04.250 --> 24:05.417
IF YOU MUST.

24:05.417 --> 24:07.417
THIS MELANIE RAY--
WHY DID SHE START

24:07.417 --> 24:08.667
HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH THE DIRECTOR?

24:08.667 --> 24:11.875
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE SHE
FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM

24:11.875 --> 24:14.375
OR MAYBE
SHE JUST WANTED SOMEONE
TO PAY ATTENTION TO HER.

24:14.375 --> 24:16.041
BUT SHE HAD SOMEONE
TO PAY ATTENTION TO HER.
SHE WAS MARRIED.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.583
YEAH, WELL,
NOT ALL RELATIONSHIPS
ARE PERFECT, DAWSON.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.291
THEY DON'T ALL
LAST FOREVER.

24:20.291 --> 24:23.125
MAYBE HE HAD A SHOT.
MAYBE HE BLEW IT.

24:23.125 --> 24:25.792
MAYBE SHE JUST
DIDN'T GIVE HIM
ENOUGH OF A CHANCE.

24:25.792 --> 24:27.417
IF YOU'RE ASKING
IF THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN ME AND TODD,

24:27.417 --> 24:28.583
THE ANSWER IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

24:28.583 --> 24:29.834
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M ASKING.

24:29.834 --> 24:31.250
OH, PLEASE.

24:31.250 --> 24:33.041
YOU ARE NOT SO GOOD
WITH THE SUBTEXT, BABY.

24:33.041 --> 24:35.500
AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE JEALOUS.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.125
JEALOUS? I'M...
WHO SAID I WAS JEALOUS?

24:38.125 --> 24:39.458
UH-HUH.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.125
YOU JUST KEEP TELLING YOURSELF
THAT, SWEETIE.

24:49.417 --> 24:51.125
HEY, WAIT UP.
WAIT UP.

24:51.125 --> 24:52.792
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
YOU FULLY COMPREHEND
THE DIRE HERE, OK?

24:52.792 --> 24:54.125
I LOST AN ENTIRE
HUMAN BEING.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.917
A TOTALLY ANNOYING
HUMAN BEING, YES,

24:55.917 --> 24:57.792
BUT I WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR HER.

24:57.792 --> 24:58.917
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
WAS GOING JUST FINE

24:58.917 --> 25:00.250
UNTIL YOU HAD TO GO
AND KISS ME.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.125
OH, SO NOW IT'S MY FAULT.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.625
YES, IT IS YOUR FAULT.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.375
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY
AND WE CAN MOVE ON.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.166
HEY, IF YOU WANT TO GET
TECHNICAL ABOUT IT,

25:06.166 --> 25:08.500
YOU KISSED ME FIRST,
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT
YOUR FAULT.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.000
SHUT UP AND
MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
NOW, IF YOU WERE
A BRATTY TEENAGE GIRL,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.667
WHERE WOULD YOU
DISAPPEAR OFF TO?

25:12.667 --> 25:15.375
OH, LISTEN, IF I
WAS A TEENAGE GIRL,
BRATTY OR OTHERWISE,

25:15.375 --> 25:18.166
I WOULD NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE.
I'D BE TOO BUSY
CHECKING MYSELF OUT.

25:18.166 --> 25:19.834
CLASSY.
AND I'LL THANK YOU
FOR THAT IMAGE.

25:19.834 --> 25:21.458
AND YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO GET TECHNICAL,

25:21.458 --> 25:23.875
IT'S HETSON'S FAULT.
HE'S THE ONE
WHO BAILED ON HER.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.125
HE WAS THE ONE
WHO WAS SUPPOSED
TO TAKE HER TO THE MOVIES.

25:27.208 --> 25:30.166
EDDIE DOLAN,
YOU ARE A GENIUS!

25:30.166 --> 25:31.083
COME ON!

25:45.542 --> 25:46.708
(FOOTSTEPS)

26:05.375 --> 26:06.583
HELLO.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.333
HI.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.667
IS EVERYTHING OK?

26:10.667 --> 26:12.667
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

26:12.667 --> 26:15.250
IF YOUR DEFINITION OF "OK"
IS HAVING THE STRONG DESIRE

26:15.250 --> 26:17.000
TO DRAW A WARM BATH
AND SLIT YOUR WRISTS,

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
THEN I AM PEACHY.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.041
AHH. YOU AND THE OLD LADY
HAVING SOME TROUBLES?

26:21.041 --> 26:22.625
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.

26:22.625 --> 26:25.542
UH-OH. DO YOU NEED
TO HAVE A BIT OF A CHAT?

26:25.542 --> 26:28.250
THAT'S NOT REALLY
OUR THING, NOW IS IT?

26:28.250 --> 26:30.250
NO, BUT WE ARE
FLATMATES,

26:30.250 --> 26:32.125
AND I SUPPOSE
THAT ENTITLES YOU
TO SOMETHING.

26:32.125 --> 26:33.583
OK.

26:35.875 --> 26:38.417
I USED TO THINK
THAT AUDREY AND I
WERE THE PERFECT FIT.

26:38.417 --> 26:41.875
AND WE WERE,
'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN ANY OF MY RELATIONSHIPS,

26:41.875 --> 26:44.083
WE WERE ON EQUAL FOOTING.
THERE WAS NO MIND GAMES,

26:44.083 --> 26:47.917
NO HIGH DRAMA, NO ANGST.
IT WAS JUST FUN.

26:47.917 --> 26:49.208
SOUNDS GOOD...

26:49.208 --> 26:52.291
IN THEORY.

26:52.291 --> 26:54.750
IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT
TO SUSTAIN THAT SORT
OF THING.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.375
THAT'S WHAT
I'M FINDING OUT.

26:56.375 --> 26:57.875
YEAH.

26:57.875 --> 27:00.250
AND IT'S MAKING ME
SECOND-GUESS MYSELF.

27:00.250 --> 27:03.583
'CAUSE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
IF THE REASON I'M CHECKING OUT

27:03.583 --> 27:06.834
IS BECAUSE I JUST
CAN'T HANDLE THE ROUGH SPOTS

27:06.834 --> 27:07.625
OR IF IT'S...

27:11.250 --> 27:12.834
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T
LOVE HER ANYMORE.

27:12.834 --> 27:14.917
HMM.

27:14.917 --> 27:18.291
OR REALLY, FOR THAT MATTER,
IF I EVER TRULY LOVED HER.

27:18.291 --> 27:20.125
(INHALES) YEAH.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.583
I'M AFRAID ONLY YOU
CAN ANSWER THAT ONE.

27:21.583 --> 27:23.583
AND TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

27:23.583 --> 27:25.125
I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO FIND OUT TONIGHT.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.083
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU AND I GO AND
REJOIN THE PARTY, HUH?

27:27.083 --> 27:28.000
OK.

27:30.000 --> 27:30.750
THANKS FOR LISTENING,
THOUGH.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.500
IT'S OK.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.125
BUT, YOU KNOW,

27:35.125 --> 27:37.083
JUST 'CAUSE WE HAD
ONE PROPER CONVERSATION,

27:37.083 --> 27:38.708
DON'T THINK YOU CAN
CRY ON MY SHOULDER
ANY TIME YOU LIKE.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.667
SO...

28:00.667 --> 28:03.083
YES?

28:03.083 --> 28:05.000
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN TOGETHER?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.166
UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"TOGETHER"?

28:06.166 --> 28:09.166
OR, I MEAN, HOW--LIKE,
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
KNOWN EACH OTHER?

28:09.166 --> 28:12.000
OH. UH, ABOUT A YEAR.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.208
WE MET AT THE STAND.

28:13.208 --> 28:16.625
OHHH. SO YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE.

28:16.625 --> 28:18.667
YEP. JUST ANOTHER
SCREWED-UP GAY KID

28:18.667 --> 28:21.375
TRYING TO REMAKE
THE WORLD IN HIS IMAGE.

28:21.375 --> 28:22.291
YOU SHOULD COME BY
SOMETIME.

28:22.291 --> 28:23.500
NO. NO, THANKS.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.333
C.J. ALREADY GAVE ME
THE HARD SELL.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.500
SO YOU'RE  THE JEN
HE'S ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.166
HE TALKS ABOUT ME?

28:30.166 --> 28:31.166
ALL THE TIME.

28:31.166 --> 28:33.208
HE WANTS YOU SO BAD.

28:33.208 --> 28:34.750
REALLY?
YEAH.

28:34.750 --> 28:37.208
HE THINKS YOU'D MAKE
A GREAT COUNSELOR.

28:37.208 --> 28:38.125
OH!

28:41.208 --> 28:43.500
FOR A SECOND--
FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT THAT--

28:43.500 --> 28:46.333
THAT YOU MEANT
THAT HE "WANTED" ME.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.500
BUT OF COURSE NOT.
HE'S--HE'S GAY.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.291
WHY WOULD HE WANT ME
THAT WAY?

28:49.291 --> 28:51.041
WHO, C.J.?
YEAH.

28:51.041 --> 28:53.166
C.J.'S NOT GAY.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.417
HE'S NOT?

28:54.417 --> 28:56.708
NO. NOT AT ALL.

28:56.708 --> 28:59.208
Jack: SORRY.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.708
I'M NOT OFFENDED,
I'M JUST NOT GAY.

29:00.708 --> 29:03.417
DAVID'S GAY.
ME, NOT SO MUCH.

29:03.417 --> 29:06.208
WELL, I KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO WILL BE VERY GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.375
WHO?

29:07.375 --> 29:09.000
A LITTLE DENSE.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.417
UH, JEN.
CUTE LITTLE BLONDE
TRAVELING COMPANION,

29:12.417 --> 29:14.208
CALLED THE HELP LINE
TO INVITE YOU
TO THIS SHINDIG.

29:14.208 --> 29:17.417
OH, THAT'S NICE TO HEAR.

29:17.417 --> 29:20.125
AND YOU'RE NOT VERY
INTERESTED, ARE YOU?

29:20.125 --> 29:21.125
TRUTH IS, I'M NOT.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.625
I MEAN, I THINK SHE'S REALLY
COOL AND EVERYTHING,

29:23.625 --> 29:25.583
I THINK SHE'D BE A REAL BENEFIT
TO THE STAND,

29:25.583 --> 29:28.250
IT'S JUST...THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.750
BUT IF YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR THAT RIGHT NOW...

29:30.750 --> 29:32.041
SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.417
Eddie: HAUNTED HOUSE
IS DOWN ONE BLOCK,

29:40.417 --> 29:43.583
MAKE A RIGHT AND JUST KEEP
FOLLOWING YOUR NOSE.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.125
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
IT'S GREAT.

29:45.125 --> 29:49.417
CHILD ABUSE. CHILD ABUSE.
NOT SO ROUGH! HI, EDDIE.

29:49.417 --> 29:51.125
YOU GAVE US QUITE A SCARE
TONIGHT, YOUNG LADY.

29:51.125 --> 29:52.583
OH, DON'T BE CUTE
WITH HER.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.792
SHE DOESN'T DESERVE
CUTE.

29:54.792 --> 29:56.667
DON'T WORRY, JOEY.
THE NIGHT'S ALMOST OVER.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.166
YOU'LL BE RID OF ME
SOON ENOUGH.

29:58.166 --> 30:01.625
THEN YOU CAN GO BACK
TO YOUR MISERABLE
LITTLE EXISTENCE.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.291
WOULD YOU MIND
GIVING US A SECOND?

30:03.291 --> 30:04.250
YEAH.

30:06.625 --> 30:09.792
UM...(CLEARS THROAT)

30:09.792 --> 30:12.792
LISTEN, I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE PISSED AT YOUR DAD
FOR FLAKING ON YOU,

30:12.792 --> 30:15.625
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S A BAD DAD

30:15.625 --> 30:17.667
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

30:17.667 --> 30:19.667
NO, IT JUST MEANS
HE'S A DICK.

30:19.667 --> 30:21.583
HARLEY--
DO YOU EVEN
LIKE HIM?

30:21.583 --> 30:23.583
SOMETIMES I DON'T SEE
HOW ANYONE COULD EVER
LIKE HIM.

30:23.583 --> 30:25.417
HE'S VERY ABRASIVE.

30:25.417 --> 30:27.208
TRUE, BUT HE'S ALSO VERY...

30:31.166 --> 30:33.875
EVERY TIME I'M SUPPOSED
TO COME SEE HIM

30:33.875 --> 30:38.000
I TRICK MYSELF INTO
THINKING THAT IT'S GONNA
BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.291
BUT IT NEVER IS.

30:40.291 --> 30:44.000
IT'S ALWAYS JUST DIFFERENT
SHADES OF THE SAME.

31:36.917 --> 31:38.417
LEERY!

31:38.417 --> 31:41.166
UH...THIS ISN'T
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE?

31:41.166 --> 31:43.083
REALLY. YOU GUYS AREN'T
SCREWING BEHIND MY BACK?

31:43.083 --> 31:44.208
NO, WE ARE.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.750
BUT LOOK AT HER,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

31:45.750 --> 31:47.041
SHE'S VERY PERSUASIVE.

31:47.041 --> 31:47.917
SHUT UP.

31:47.917 --> 31:50.208
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
TO SHUT UP.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.083
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
FIRE ME? YOU TRIED THAT
BEFORE. IT DOESN'T TAKE.

31:52.083 --> 31:56.083
LISTEN, NATASHA, I'M--
I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT I HURT YOU.

31:56.083 --> 31:59.708
I MEAN, THAT WAS THE LAST
THING THAT I WANTED TO
HAVE HAPPEN, BELIEVE ME.

31:59.708 --> 32:04.166
I GOT INVOLVED IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED
SITUATION,

32:04.166 --> 32:07.375
AND I MADE A CHOICE
WITHOUT THINKING
AND IT WAS THE WRONG CHOICE,

32:07.375 --> 32:09.542
WHICH IS WHAT I DON'T THINK
I'VE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO...

32:09.542 --> 32:13.542
COMMUNICATE TO YOU,
WHICH IS I--I LIKE YOU.

32:13.542 --> 32:18.041
I KEEP ON SAYING THAT
I'M NOT JEALOUS,
BUT I--I AM.

32:18.041 --> 32:20.917
I'M VERY JEALOUS. THIS IS--
THE THOUGHT OF SOME OTHER
GUY TOUCHING YOU,

32:20.917 --> 32:24.083
ESPECIALLY HIM--
I MEAN, HE'S...

32:24.083 --> 32:26.083
TODD.

32:26.083 --> 32:28.750
LEERY, I'M NOT ADVERSE TO
GIVING THIS WHOLE FIRING THING
ANOTHER GO, YOU KNOW.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.041
TOO LATE. I QUIT.

32:33.041 --> 32:33.750
I...

32:36.417 --> 32:38.083
GOOD LUCK WITH
THE REST OF THE MOVIE.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.625
I'M OUTTA HERE.

33:30.959 --> 33:31.917
(LAUGHS)

33:35.375 --> 33:37.500
LEERY, THIS IS
BLOODY GOLD, MATE!

33:37.500 --> 33:39.125
WHAT THE--

33:39.125 --> 33:40.959
HAPPY HALLOWEEN,
DAWSON.

33:40.959 --> 33:41.834
WE'VE HAD
THE IMMENSE PLEASURE

33:41.834 --> 33:43.166
OF SCREWING WITH YOUR MIND
THIS EVENING.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.125
(EXHALES)

33:45.125 --> 33:46.041
WAIT.

33:46.041 --> 33:47.041
SO YOU TWO
AREN'T EVEN--

33:47.041 --> 33:50.542
NO WAY. TOO OLD,
TOO MANY EXTRAS.

33:50.542 --> 33:52.333
YEAH, I'M NOT TOO INTO
MY ASSISTANT'S SLOPPY
SECONDS, EITHER.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.500
WATCH IT.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.000
WHAT ABOUT THE FOOTAGE?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.792
THE MAGIC OF
MOVIE-MAKING, MATE.

33:57.792 --> 34:00.333
WASN'T THAT A LOT
TO GO THROUGH JUST TO GET
A LAUGH AT MY EXPENSE?

34:00.333 --> 34:04.208
NO.
WORTH EVERY SECOND.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.375
RIGHT. I'M GONNA
GO GET DANNY BOY TO
EDIT THIS TOGETHER.

34:06.375 --> 34:07.375
OOH, I WANNA SEE.

34:07.375 --> 34:08.375
COME ON, THEN.

34:08.375 --> 34:09.583
UM...

34:09.583 --> 34:13.833
YOU WEREN'T SERIOUS
ABOUT THE WHOLE
QUITTING THING, RIGHT?

34:13.833 --> 34:16.375
'CAUSE I SORT OF
NEED SOME HELP WITH
MY SHOT LISTS TONIGHT.

34:16.375 --> 34:18.166
YOU UP FOR IT?

34:18.166 --> 34:19.083
YOU'RE A SCHOLAR.

34:26.750 --> 34:30.333
WE DIDN'T REALLY
GET MUCH OF A CHANCE
TO TALK TONIGHT.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.667
WELL, YOU COULD ALWAYS
CALL THE HELP LINE
AGAIN.

34:32.667 --> 34:37.708
YOU KNOW, I WAS
ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT
RECONSIDERING THE STAND.

34:37.708 --> 34:40.833
I FEEL LIKE MAYBE
I WAS JUST TOO JUDGMENTAL
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

34:40.833 --> 34:42.875
WELL, WE'D LOVE
TO HAVE YOU.

34:42.875 --> 34:46.375
JUST, YOU KNOW, MAKE
SURE YOU'RE DOING IT
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.583
ARE THERE
ANY OTHER REASONS?

34:48.583 --> 34:51.708
I DON'T KNOW.

34:51.708 --> 34:55.125
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD SAVE ME
A LOT OF TROUBLE BY JUST
GOING OUT WITH ME.

34:57.041 --> 34:58.750
Jack: THIS IS
MAKING ME SAD.

34:58.750 --> 35:01.083
David: WHY?

35:01.083 --> 35:03.417
WELL,
HE'S NOT INTO HER,

35:03.417 --> 35:05.750
AND I'M THE ONE
WHO TOLD HER TO CALL HIM.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.917
TRUST ME,
SHE'S BETTER OFF.

35:07.917 --> 35:10.875
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:10.875 --> 35:13.208
UH...IT'S A LONG STORY.

35:13.208 --> 35:16.875
WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT
SOMETIME OVER COFFEE?

35:16.875 --> 35:17.875
COFFEE?

35:17.875 --> 35:18.917
HOT CAFFEINATED BEVERAGE.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.792
IT'S ALL THE RAGE THESE DAYS.

35:20.792 --> 35:22.083
SEEMS TO BE AN EXCUSE
FOR PEOPLE TO GET TOGETHER

35:22.083 --> 35:24.208
AND FIND OUT
IF THEY LIKE ONE ANOTHER.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.041
YEAH, I THINK I'D BE UP
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

35:26.041 --> 35:26.959
COOL.

35:29.125 --> 35:30.792
YOU READY?
YEAH.

35:30.792 --> 35:32.166
WELL, IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU.

35:32.166 --> 35:33.125
LIKEWISE.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.917
JACK.
C.J.

35:34.917 --> 35:36.291
AND I GUESS
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

35:36.291 --> 35:37.417
DAVE, DEFINITELY.
OK.

35:37.417 --> 35:38.625
BYE.
BYE.

35:41.792 --> 35:43.166
HOW'D THAT GO?

35:43.166 --> 35:45.250
WELL, HE'S PLAYING
A LITTLE HARD TO GET,

35:45.250 --> 35:46.917
WHICH IS SOMEWHAT
DISCONCERTING,

35:46.917 --> 35:48.542
BUT NO WORRIES.
HE'LL BE MINE.

35:48.542 --> 35:50.792
(SIGHS)

35:50.792 --> 35:52.834
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

35:58.625 --> 35:59.792
HI, SWEETHEART.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.667
HEY, DAD.
HOW WAS THE DATE?

36:03.667 --> 36:05.750
WENT GREAT.

36:05.750 --> 36:07.959
RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT
WHEN SHE SAID I HAD
A TOXIC PERSONALITY.

36:07.959 --> 36:11.000
IS THAT BAD?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.041
HOW'D EVERYTHING GO
HERE?

36:12.041 --> 36:14.834
GREAT. SHE WAS
A PERFECT ANGEL.

36:14.834 --> 36:16.333
COOL.

36:16.333 --> 36:17.667
YOU READY?

36:17.667 --> 36:19.208
GIMME A SECOND,
DAD.

36:24.667 --> 36:27.125
SORRY I WAS SUCH
AN UBER-BITCH.

36:27.125 --> 36:28.875
WE ALL HAVE OUR MOMENTS.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.625
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:33.625 --> 36:35.625
DON'T STOP HOPING THAT THINGS
WILL BE DIFFERENT WITH HIM.

36:35.625 --> 36:38.000
YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG
TO BE SO BITTER.

36:42.875 --> 36:44.542
CAN I GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE?

36:44.542 --> 36:45.875
SURE.

36:45.875 --> 36:47.708
EDDIE
TOTALLY LIKES YOU.

36:47.708 --> 36:51.041
I HOPE A GUY
LIKE HIM LOOKS AT ME
THAT WAY SOMEDAY.

36:51.041 --> 36:53.375
DON'T MESS IT UP.

36:53.375 --> 36:54.875
OK.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.000
(CLEARS THROAT)

37:05.000 --> 37:06.583
ONE ROOT BEER FLOAT.

37:06.583 --> 37:09.000
WHERE IS SHE?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.375
GONE. HETSON
JUST PICKED HER UP.

37:10.375 --> 37:11.750
WANNA SPLIT THIS?

37:11.750 --> 37:12.750
SHAME TO SEE IT
GO TO WASTE,

37:12.750 --> 37:13.583
LIKE MY POTENTIAL.

37:13.583 --> 37:15.333
SHUT UP.

37:19.250 --> 37:21.041
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

37:21.041 --> 37:22.708
IF YOU MUST.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.667
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH US?

37:25.667 --> 37:27.041
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:27.041 --> 37:31.375
I MEAN...I KISS YOU,
YOU KISS ME.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.417
IN SOME STATES
THAT COULD BE
CONSTRUED AS DATING.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.417
WE'RE NOT DATING.

37:34.417 --> 37:36.250
OH, GOD, NO.

37:36.250 --> 37:39.583
AND I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO HETSON'S CLASS.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.041
THAT'S FINE.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.083
IS IT?

37:42.083 --> 37:43.583
ABSOLUTELY.

37:43.583 --> 37:45.375
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE,
EDDIE.

37:45.375 --> 37:47.125
I HAVE NO DESIRE
TO CHANGE THAT.

37:47.125 --> 37:50.208
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOEY?

37:50.208 --> 37:52.959
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH US...

37:52.959 --> 37:55.250
BUT I KIND OF
LIKE IT THAT WAY.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.208
ME, TOO.

38:02.375 --> 38:04.750
HEY. THERE YOU ARE.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.375
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

38:09.708 --> 38:11.083
IS EVERYTHING OK?

38:11.083 --> 38:14.583
I THINK WE SHOULD BREAK UP,
PACEY.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.291
(CHUCKLES) WHAT?

38:21.583 --> 38:22.708
LET'S JUST GO HOME
AND SLEEP ON IT.

38:22.708 --> 38:24.125
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE MORNING.

38:24.125 --> 38:25.625
NO.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.250
THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

38:32.166 --> 38:33.792
THIS IS NOT
THE WAY I WANTED
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

38:33.792 --> 38:35.458
SHUT UP, PACEY!

38:35.458 --> 38:38.250
JUST SHUT UP, OK?

38:38.250 --> 38:41.083
YOU ARE GETTING OFF EASY HERE
AND YOU KNOW IT.

38:41.083 --> 38:43.417
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU PUT UP
SOME FALSE PROTEST

38:43.417 --> 38:45.458
SO THAT YOU CAN FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOURSELF.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.875
I AM ENDING IT NOW.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.375
THAT'S HOW I KNOW
THAT IT'S OVER.

39:00.166 --> 39:02.041
YOU DIDN'T SAY A WORD,
PACEY,

39:02.041 --> 39:04.458
NOT A WORD.

39:04.458 --> 39:08.000
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
THE ENERGY TO FIGHT IT, AND...

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.500
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DO.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.500
YOU DESERVE
WAY BETTER THAN THAT.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.708
GO AHEAD, PACEY.
WHY DON'T YOU FOLLOW THE SCRIPT?

39:16.708 --> 39:19.834
YOU KNOW, SAY ALL OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SAY TO ME.

39:19.834 --> 39:21.208
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE?

39:21.208 --> 39:22.667
HOW MANY EMPTY WORDS
IS IT GONNA TAKE

39:22.667 --> 39:24.125
FOR YOU TO BE ABLE
TO SLEEP EASY TONIGHT?

39:24.125 --> 39:25.166
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME, AUDREY?

39:25.166 --> 39:27.125
YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT HOW IT IS,

39:27.125 --> 39:28.500
BUT THE NEGATIVITY
GETS TO ME, TOO, OK?

39:28.500 --> 39:30.458
SO I AGREE WITH YOU.

39:30.458 --> 39:34.500
DON'T YOU DARE TRY TO MAKE
YOURSELF FEEL NOBLE, PACEY.

39:34.500 --> 39:38.750
YOU ARE NOT SOME
KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR.

39:38.750 --> 39:42.208
YOU'RE JUST A GUY WHO'S GROWN
TIRED OF SCREWING THE SAME GIRL

39:42.208 --> 39:44.708
AND YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT IT.

39:44.708 --> 39:46.750
YOU THINK THAT SUCKS?

39:53.375 --> 39:55.625
WHY DON'T YOU--
WHY DON'T YOU TRY BEING THE ONE

39:55.625 --> 39:59.875
WHO HAS TO WONDER WHY
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SHE LOVES
DON'T LOVE HER BACK.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.417
OH, AUDREY, COME ON.

40:02.917 --> 40:04.875
OHH.
(SOBBING)

40:34.333 --> 40:35.500
STILL MAD AT ME?

40:37.250 --> 40:38.625
I WAS NEVER MAD AT YOU.
I WAS--

40:38.625 --> 40:40.417
INSANELY JEALOUS?

40:40.417 --> 40:42.542
(SIGHS)
I DON'T THINK I REALIZED

40:42.542 --> 40:43.458
HOW MUCH I ACTUALLY
WANTED TO BE WITH YOU

40:43.458 --> 40:45.208
UNTIL I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH TODD.

40:45.208 --> 40:46.959
SAY IT AGAIN.

40:46.959 --> 40:48.542
WHAT, THAT I WAS JEALOUS?

40:48.542 --> 40:50.959
NO. THAT YOU LIKE ME.

40:50.959 --> 40:52.917
I LIKE YOU, NATASHA.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.250
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

40:55.250 --> 40:57.417
GOOD, BECAUSE...

40:57.417 --> 41:00.542
I LIKE YOU, TOO.

41:00.542 --> 41:03.583
A LOT OF PEOPLE WALK IN
AND OUT OF MY LIFE,
DAWSON, AND...

41:03.583 --> 41:05.625
YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY,

41:05.625 --> 41:09.291
BECAUSE I'M AN ACTOR
AND I LIE FOR A LIVING,

41:09.291 --> 41:10.625
BUT...

41:10.625 --> 41:14.583
YOU'RE ONE OF THE ONLY
PEOPLE I EVER REALLY
WANTED TO STICK AROUND.

41:14.583 --> 41:16.583
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO BELIEVE...

41:16.583 --> 41:19.500
BUT I LOVE MY LIFE.
I...

41:19.500 --> 41:21.208
WAKE UP MOST MORNINGS
PINCHING MYSELF

41:21.208 --> 41:24.458
THAT I GET TO TAKE
EVEN A SMALL PART
IN ALL OF THIS. BUT...

41:26.583 --> 41:31.125
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL LIKE
IT'S ALL AN ILLUSION.

41:31.125 --> 41:34.750
YOU KNOW? I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
IT'S ALL JUST ONE MOMENT AWAY
FROM DISAPPEARING FOREVER.

41:34.750 --> 41:36.500
THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

41:36.500 --> 41:40.959
FOR ALL I KNOW, THIS
COULD BE MY LAST JOB.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.917
YEAH.

41:44.917 --> 41:49.500
SO I'M GOING TO
ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE
WHILE IT LASTS,

41:49.500 --> 41:52.708
HUG EVERYBODY NOW,
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT
BE HERE TOMORROW,

41:52.708 --> 41:56.708
AND TAKE THE EXPERIENCE
WITH ME.

41:56.708 --> 42:02.291
AND IF MEETING YOU
IS ALL I GET
OUT OF THIS ONE,

42:02.291 --> 42:05.375
WELL, IT MIGHT JUST
BE ENOUGH FOR ME.

42:16.667 --> 42:18.041
GOD, I MISSED YOU.

42:19.625 --> 42:21.000
I ALWAYS WANTED YOU
BACK, YOU KNOW.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.834
YOU JUST HAD TO
PAY FOR YOUR SINS.

42:22.834 --> 42:25.375
ARE WE EVEN NOW?

42:25.375 --> 42:26.667
JUST ABOUT.

42:39.667 --> 42:41.875
WAIT, ARE YOU...
SURE ABOUT THIS?

42:41.875 --> 42:45.250
AS SURE AS I'VE EVER BEEN ABOUT
ANYTHING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

42:45.250 --> 42:47.000
GROOVY.
