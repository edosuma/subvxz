WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.836
ANNOUNCER: Everyday heroes
doing extraordinary things.

00:02.870 --> 00:04.038
9-1-1 returns.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.173
We're gonna find you.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.874
ANNOUNCER: Catch
all-new episodes Mondays

00:06.907 --> 00:09.077
and check out
our other Fox programs.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.979
Prodigal Son, Almost Family
and  The Resident.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.314
There's more to the story
than you know.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.748
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.589
(tense music)

00:21.622 --> 00:23.757
So Darius...

00:23.791 --> 00:27.861
May tells me that you're not
going to college next fall.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.498
No, Ms., uh, Ms. Grant.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.533
Mrs. Nash.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.069
Um, I'm taking a gap year

00:35.103 --> 00:37.205
and then hopefully Stanford.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.741
Stanford is a great school.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.276
What do you plan on studying?

00:42.310 --> 00:43.711
Well, both of my parents
are doctors--

00:43.744 --> 00:45.613
What does one do in a gap year?

00:45.646 --> 00:49.383
Bounce around Europe
with backpack and a rail pass?

00:49.417 --> 00:51.119
(laughter)

00:51.152 --> 00:52.620
Mom, be nice.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.288
I'm not being nice?

00:54.322 --> 00:56.023
No, you're being Grandma Bea.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.259
So what kind of doctor
do you plan on being?

00:59.760 --> 01:03.131
You know, just working with,
um...

01:03.164 --> 01:04.865
Darius,
I didn't even go to college.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.100
Wait, that's an option?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.468
-ATHENA: No.
-MICHAEL: No.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.636
(door bell rings)

01:08.669 --> 01:10.204
BOBBY: I'll get it.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.406
Oh. Um, we should get going.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.407
We don't want to miss
the movie.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.042
Come on, Darius.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.811
Wait, May, I thought the movie
started at 9:00.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.080
Well, you know,
traffic and parking

01:20.114 --> 01:22.116
and we need time

01:22.150 --> 01:24.252
for the bathroom
and ticket booth and all that,

01:24.285 --> 01:25.919
so we're probably already late.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.988
Dinner was great.
Pleasure meeting you all.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.890
Yes, I'll see you soon

01:29.923 --> 01:33.661
at 11:30 when you drop
May off at the door.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.795
At the door.

01:34.828 --> 01:35.996
Okay, all right.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.999
Have fun.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.969
Elaine, hey.
What are you doing here?

01:42.002 --> 01:44.272
I'm sorry
to bother you at home.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.573
Didn't mean to interrupt
your dinner.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.275
Oh, no, we just finished.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.609
You want something?
Come on in.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.511
No, no, um...

01:50.544 --> 01:54.182
I had some unexpected
news today, and...

01:54.215 --> 01:55.916
I didn't want you
to hear it from anyone else.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.985
Okay.

01:58.018 --> 02:01.189
We found the gun
that killed Emmett.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.257
(dramatic music)

02:03.291 --> 02:06.093
Athena?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.628
Are...

02:07.661 --> 02:09.463
are you sure?

02:09.497 --> 02:11.932
Yeah, I had them check
and double-check

02:11.965 --> 02:14.134
before I came here.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.469
Who's Emmett?

02:15.503 --> 02:17.705
I have no earthly idea.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.340
Who's Emmett?

02:21.542 --> 02:24.645
Uh, Emmett Washington.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.480
He was my fiancÃ©.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.486
-(phone buttons beep)
-(siren whirs)

02:35.356 --> 02:38.158
Found it
during a traffic stop.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.861
Tomas Alma.
19.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.197
Too young to be
Emmett's killer

02:43.231 --> 02:45.399
and currently
not speaking to us.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.902
Gun has probably gone through
a lot of hands since '91.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.571
I'm putting a lot
of guys on this one.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.005
You don't have to worry.

02:52.039 --> 02:56.377
Look, I may have to take
a few days off.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.479
I'm sorry if I stepped in it
the other night.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.080
I didn't know that--

03:00.113 --> 03:02.416
That I haven't talked
about Emmett in 20 years.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.385
There's no way
you could've known.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.919
Yeah.

03:05.953 --> 03:09.590
If I hear anything,
I'll call next time.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.724
Thanks.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.230
SINGER: * All you've got
to do now, express yourself *

03:16.264 --> 03:18.532
DR. DRE: * I'm expressing
with my full capabilities *

03:18.566 --> 03:20.834
* And now I'm living
in correctional facilities *

03:20.868 --> 03:23.537
* 'Cause some don't agree
with how I do this *

03:23.571 --> 03:24.872
* I get straight,
meditate like a Buddhist *

03:24.905 --> 03:26.374
Waste of time.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.576
It's not a waste of time,
Athena.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.511
We're opening ourselves
up to the world

03:30.544 --> 03:32.613
of possibilities on offer.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.782
Please. What kind of person
upends their whole life

03:34.815 --> 03:36.350
because someone
handed them a flyer?

03:36.384 --> 03:37.551
Cheryl.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.887
(laughter)

03:39.920 --> 03:41.755
Ladies,
can I interest you

03:41.789 --> 03:43.591
in an exciting
career opportunity?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.559
LAPD's looking for the best
and the brightest

03:45.593 --> 03:47.060
to join our ranks,

03:47.094 --> 03:49.263
and you three
seem like prime candidates.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.698
Appreciate the sales pitch,

03:50.731 --> 03:52.866
but we're already
on our career paths.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.036
Lawyers and police are
all part of the same system.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.971
We just get
to the bad guys first.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.907
You seem cool,
but the only people folks

03:59.940 --> 04:01.942
hate more than lawyers
are cops.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.744
-Okay?
-At least we're paid better.

04:03.777 --> 04:04.912
-That's right.
-True.

04:04.945 --> 04:05.913
EMMETT: People only hate police

04:05.946 --> 04:07.381
until they need us.

04:07.415 --> 04:10.083
No, sometimes
they hate you after.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.653
(laughing)
Let's go.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.721
Wait.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.956
I'm Emmett.

04:15.989 --> 04:19.460
In case you decide
to give us another look.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.963
SINGER: * All you've got to do
now, express yourself *

04:22.996 --> 04:25.433
GABI: Wouldn't mind giving him
another look.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.200
-Wow.
-Hmm.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.572
"Where's that soap
you put in the dishwasher?"

04:31.605 --> 04:33.674
"Which dry cleaners
has my blue suit?"

04:33.707 --> 04:36.910
(laughs) I swear that phone
never stopped ringing.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.780
Aww, Daddy's lost without you.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.182
I can't believe he let you
come out here by yourself.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.585
Well, he knew better than
to try to stop me.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.854
(laughter)

04:46.887 --> 04:50.324
It's been hard,
you so far away from home.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.693
I am half a mind

04:52.726 --> 04:54.628
to make your father
move out here

04:54.662 --> 04:56.096
so we can see you more often.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.832
You couldn't get Daddy here
for five days.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.634
How you gonna get him here
for the rest of his life?

05:00.668 --> 05:02.102
That's where you come in.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.271
Grandbabies.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.806
Mama.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.108
We've talked about this.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.779
I have to finish law school
and get a good job,

05:11.812 --> 05:14.281
then I will find a good man,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.817
and I will give you
grandbabies.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.352
You do not get to shuffle
the order

05:18.386 --> 05:19.720
because you're bored
in Florida.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.689
(laughter)

05:23.557 --> 05:26.960
Oh, Athena.
I didn't tell you.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.930
Your daddy said Mrs. Kingston
passed away last night.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.033
What?

05:33.066 --> 05:35.235
She's you age.
What happened?

05:35.268 --> 05:37.304
They're saying cancer,

05:37.337 --> 05:40.474
but I think
it's more like heartbreak.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.143
She never got over
losing that girl.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.746
Did they ever find out
what happened to Tanya?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.047
Who took her?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.583
Not sure how hard they looked.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.720
You know, Mrs. Kingston
went to that police station

05:52.753 --> 05:55.188
every month begging for help,

05:55.222 --> 05:57.658
searching for answers.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.861
Maybe she has them now.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.831
(somber music)

06:03.864 --> 06:10.671
*

06:10.704 --> 06:11.872
YOUNG MC: * Bust it

06:11.905 --> 06:14.875
(Young MC's "Bust a Move")

06:14.908 --> 06:17.044
* This here's a jam
for all the fellas *

06:17.077 --> 06:19.346
EMMETT: Well, the department's
goal is 20% female officers.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.048
We're about halfway there.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.618
10%?
Wait, wait, wait.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.854
I'll be outnumbered
nine to one?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.557
What? That's--talk about
sticking out in a crowd.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.559
I imagine you'd stick out
in any crowd,

06:31.592 --> 06:33.761
regardless
of the demographic makeup.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.364
Well, now I'm starting
to wonder exactly

06:37.397 --> 06:38.699
what you're trying
to recruit me for.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.200
All right, all right, look.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.703
I can spout off facts
and figures all night.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.805
It'll be boring,
not to mention a terrible way

06:44.838 --> 06:47.107
for you to decide
what to do with your life.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.576
Yeah, well,
how did you figure it out?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.544
Hang up the classifieds,
throw a dart?

06:50.578 --> 06:52.045
Sixth grade.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.314
Two narcotics detectives
came to my class.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.450
They had a slide presentation
for us.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.818
Reasons to join the LAPD?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.953
Nope. Crime scene photos.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.757
Pictures of people
who died because of drugs.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.960
The way those guys talked
about our world, our community,

07:06.994 --> 07:10.998
how broken it was,
it opened my eyes.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.801
That's when I knew I had to do
something to make it better.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.069
SINGER: * Baby, you got it

07:16.103 --> 07:18.672
ATHENA: Quit law school
six weeks later.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.841
HEN: Wow.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.677
I had no idea.
I never even suspected it.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.747
Athena,
you are good at these secrets.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.982
Don't be mad.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.751
You know,
you once told me

07:30.784 --> 07:34.354
that it's the not knowing
that haunts us.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.289
You were talking
about yourself.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.291
Well, I've seen what comes
from living with ghosts,

07:38.325 --> 07:40.961
the toll it takes.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.963
I mean, the man who fired
that bullet

07:42.996 --> 07:44.532
had already taken
so much from me.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.667
I wasn't gonna let him
have the rest.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.369
I just put all my grief,
my pain,

07:49.402 --> 07:51.104
locked it in a box.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.741
That's the only way
I knew how to move forward.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.111
So how does it feel now?

07:58.145 --> 08:01.281
Now that Pandora's
cracked open that box.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.051
Feels more like I'm the one
who's cracked open.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.321
I mean, I know they have
a million questions.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.090
I'm just not ready
to answer them.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.794
So that's why
you're here with me?

08:13.827 --> 08:14.828
You're hiding.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.067
I...I don't know
how to talk about...

08:20.100 --> 08:23.036
him without talking
about what happened after him.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.506
I mean,
I threw myself into my job.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.709
Just focused all my efforts

08:28.742 --> 08:30.678
on trying to make a difference,
you know?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.681
In the world, the department,
my way of honoring him.

08:33.714 --> 08:37.751
Okay, so...
you got the gun.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.387
That's a big break
in the case, right?

08:40.420 --> 08:41.755
Yeah.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.190
Can you track it?

08:43.223 --> 08:45.258
Well, technically,
I can't do anything.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.561
I mean, everyone from
my captain to my husband

08:47.595 --> 08:49.730
has made me promise
not to go near it.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.099
Just let the detectives
do their jobs.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.501
(laughs)
Athena.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.203
You have never been one
to be hung up

08:56.236 --> 08:57.437
on a technicality.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.440
(dramatic music)

09:00.473 --> 09:02.943
*

09:02.976 --> 09:05.245
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.747
Thought you could use
a pick-me-up.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.682
Thanks.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.050
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.185
Me, either.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.888
You've been keeping tabs
on the case?

09:14.922 --> 09:17.257
Emmett was my partner.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.059
Never sat right that
we couldn't solve it.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.260
Wasn't much to go on.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.764
Just a bullet and this guy.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.398
I mean, I stared at him
so many nights,

09:25.432 --> 09:27.835
I could probably
draw him from memory.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.640
Oh.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.942
I'm sorry.
You like it with sugar.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.276
It's fine.
I'll be right back.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.244
(laughs)

09:40.513 --> 09:47.254
*

10:06.306 --> 10:09.677
(sighs)
Ugh.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.645
I gotta go
and pick up the kids.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.113
I'll talk to you later.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.683
-Yeah, okay.
-All right, thanks.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.651
Hey, Athena, wait.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.621
I know we've both been waiting
for this a long time...

10:21.655 --> 10:24.624
but I promise you,
we're gonna find him.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.661
Yes.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.862
We will.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.637
SINGER: * Back to life

10:37.671 --> 10:39.840
* Back to reality

10:39.873 --> 10:43.043
* Back to the here and now

10:43.076 --> 10:46.279
* How ever do you want me,
how ever do you need me *

10:46.313 --> 10:48.381
WATCH COMMANDER:
As for our new faces...

10:48.415 --> 10:51.518
Carter,
you're with McCluskey.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.787
Franklin,
you ride with Sanchez,

10:53.821 --> 10:56.223
and, Morris, you're with...

10:56.256 --> 10:58.859
Morris.
Okay, well, that's a typo.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.494
Just...come and see me.
Okay, that's it.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.296
Pool assignments
are on the board.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.565
Don't get dead,
and don't dent my cars.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.067
Go.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.837
(indistinct chatter)

11:11.104 --> 11:13.040
Hi, Officer McCluskey?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.242
Hi, Athena Carter.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.978
No, it's not.
Look, for whatever reason,

11:18.011 --> 11:20.047
I keep getting shouldered
with schooling you people.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.049
Oh, hell.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.651
No, I don't mean it like that,
so don't go there.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.453
So you don't think
women can do the job?

11:29.389 --> 11:30.858
I think you don't want to.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.592
Or at least not for very long.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.661
I've been doing this
for 28 years.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.697
I've passed down my knowledge
to five female rookies,

11:37.731 --> 11:39.833
all who fell in love,
got married,

11:39.867 --> 11:40.934
and left the force
to have kids,

11:40.968 --> 11:42.502
so I got...

11:42.535 --> 11:44.037
what do you call it?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.405
Abandonment issues.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.707
Hmm.
I'm serious about this job,

11:47.741 --> 11:51.044
so I'm happy to take any wisdom
you want to send my way,

11:51.078 --> 11:55.182
but you should treat me the way
you would any other officer.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.617
SINGER: * Ooh, ladies first

11:57.650 --> 11:59.519
* Ladies first

11:59.552 --> 12:02.022
CHORUS: * Ooh, ladies first

12:02.055 --> 12:03.791
* Ladies first

12:03.824 --> 12:07.127
* Ooh, ladies first

12:07.160 --> 12:09.729
(Queen Latifah's
"Ladies First")

12:09.763 --> 12:11.598
*

12:11.631 --> 12:12.933
QUEEN LATIFAH:
* The ladies will kick it

12:12.966 --> 12:14.701
* The rhyme that is wicked

12:14.734 --> 12:16.469
* Those that don't know how
to be pros get evicted *

12:16.503 --> 12:18.238
* A woman can bear you,
break you *

12:18.271 --> 12:20.540
What the hell did I say
about my cars vis-Ã -vis dents?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.610
Carter, do it again, I'm
putting you on hose-down duty.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.611
(knocking at door)

12:26.079 --> 12:28.748
So how was the first day?

12:28.782 --> 12:31.084
-Oh.
-(siren wailing)

12:31.118 --> 12:32.953
MONIE LOVE:* Pleased with all
the beats and rhymes *

12:32.986 --> 12:34.988
* My sisters have employed,
slick and smooth *

12:35.022 --> 12:38.291
I need you to turn around,
put your hands up now.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.327
MONIE LOVE: * To my sister,
can I get some? *

12:40.360 --> 12:41.661
QUEEN LATIFAH:
* Sure, Monie Love

12:41.694 --> 12:42.896
* Grab the mic
and get dumb, yo *

12:42.930 --> 12:46.466
(both grunting)

12:46.499 --> 12:48.135
MONIE LOVE: * Believe me

12:48.168 --> 12:50.303
* When I say being a woman
is great, you see *

12:50.337 --> 12:52.572
* I know that all the fellas
out there will agree with me *

12:52.605 --> 12:55.308
WATCH COMMANDER: Finally,
I'm told the LAPD is on track

12:55.342 --> 12:57.610
for the fewest number
of officer-involved shootings

12:57.644 --> 12:59.779
since 1981.

12:59.813 --> 13:03.984
Now, let's try not to shoot
anyone until the '90s, okay?

13:04.017 --> 13:06.519
EMMETT:
Ma, this is Athena.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.989
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Washington.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.791
Emmett was right.
You are a beauty.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.260
(laughter)

13:13.293 --> 13:14.427
Hope you brought protection.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.929
Ma'am?

13:15.963 --> 13:17.330
From the girls at church.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.599
When they see you
with my boy...

13:19.632 --> 13:20.633
ooh.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.669
(laughter)

13:22.702 --> 13:26.639
ALL: Four, three, two, one.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.675
Happy New Year!

13:28.708 --> 13:30.443
(cheering)

13:30.477 --> 13:32.779
So that happened.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.547
Come on, after midnight's
when the real crazies come out.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.949
I don't want to miss it.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.784
You're just excited you get
to shoot people again.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.887
Oh, that's right.
I forgot about that.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.388
QUEEN LATIFAH: * You never
catch me at my worst *

13:41.421 --> 13:42.489
* You get the drift?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.624
* It's Ladies First

13:44.657 --> 13:45.993
(sirens wailing)

13:46.026 --> 13:48.795
(indistinct radio chatter)

13:48.828 --> 13:51.231
(dramatic music)

13:51.264 --> 13:53.466
Damn, bitch.
Watch the cuffs!

13:53.500 --> 13:54.701
Exercise your right
to be silent

13:54.734 --> 13:56.503
before I force it on you.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.072
McCluskey, we got another one
for processing.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.473
EMMETT:
Excuse me, prosecutor,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.575
but I object.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.513
This is not your sector.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.049
But it is my collar.
You know Mack.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.551
He doesn't believe in being
confined to sectors.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.621
EMMETT: Yeah, but he sure knows
how to find primo crime scenes.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.157
ROMERO: Emmett.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.893
Escorting our wounded friend
to Mercy West. Meet me?

14:19.927 --> 14:21.895
EMMETT: Right behind you,
Rick.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.163
So you working Sunday?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.497
No, I'm off.
Why?

14:24.531 --> 14:25.632
EMMETT: You'll see.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.368
Okay.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.041
We better call the restaurant,

14:34.074 --> 14:36.376
tell them that
we're gonna be late.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.112
Or we could just stay in.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.114
Order a pizza.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.050
Where's the phone?

14:47.287 --> 14:48.221
Found it.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.966
(exhales)

15:00.767 --> 15:04.071
This wasn't how
I thought it would go.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.042
I had a whole speech planned.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.411
I was gonna do it when
they brought out the tiramisu.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.281
I love tiramisu.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.449
I know.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.886
(exhales)

15:19.919 --> 15:21.321
So...

15:23.623 --> 15:26.226
Athena Carter...

15:26.259 --> 15:27.760
will you marry me?

15:30.163 --> 15:31.764
Yes.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.766
Yes.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.802
(squeals)

15:35.835 --> 15:38.771
(heartfelt music)

15:38.805 --> 15:41.774
*

15:41.808 --> 15:44.111
I love you.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.080
I love you, too.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.516
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you said yes!

15:49.549 --> 15:51.151
(laughter)

15:54.221 --> 15:56.089
BOBBY: I'm back.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.191
ROMERO: You forgot the sugar?
You played me.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.127
ATHENA: I wanted to keep you
out of it.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.495
Why? You don't think I want
a crack at this guy too?

16:02.529 --> 16:03.763
Emmett was my best friend.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.931
Whatever you're up to--

16:04.964 --> 16:07.300
You can't be a part of it,
Rick.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.835
Look, I don't know
what's gonna happen,

16:08.868 --> 16:10.137
but there's a pretty
good chance

16:10.170 --> 16:12.205
I'm gonna be out of a job
when it's done.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.474
I'm not taking you
down with me.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.842
I'm willing to take that risk.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.744
I'm not.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.218
Here.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.554
This is everything we have
on Emmett's murder,

16:27.587 --> 16:30.223
including background
on the gun's most recent owner.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.060
I've highlighted some
interesting ATM withdrawals.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.030
Hey, Bobby.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.398
BOBBY: Rick.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.976
What's going on?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.912
Nothing.
Rick's just upset.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.083
That you're investigating
Emmett's murder on your own?

16:56.116 --> 16:58.585
The thing you told me
you were not gonna do?

16:58.618 --> 17:00.387
Look, Athena, just talk to me.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.721
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.756
I did not lose someone.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.226
He was taken from me.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.695
Now you may understand my pain,

17:08.728 --> 17:10.363
but you do not
understand struggle.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.932
I need to do this.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.568
Bring his killer in?
On your own?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.337
Oh, no one else
has gotten the job right.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.838
Why not me?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.340
I'm more than capable.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.175
Well, there is a man
who has gotten away with murder

17:22.209 --> 17:23.276
for almost 30 years.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.444
You think he's gonna be happy

17:24.477 --> 17:25.912
to see you show up
on his doorstep?

17:25.945 --> 17:27.847
Don't much care
about his feelings.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.716
No, I want you to care
about our safety.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.418
There's no backup.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.919
Nobody knows where you're going
or who you're talking to.

17:32.952 --> 17:33.886
It's reckless, dangerous.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.255
It's necessary.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.424
He needs to pay
for what he's done.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.293
And I need to make sure that
that happens.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.895
I have to do this.
It has to be me.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.264
-Why?
-Be...

17:44.297 --> 17:45.265
(sighs)

17:47.567 --> 17:50.203
Because I'm the reason
that Emmett was killed.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.372
I'm the reason he's dead.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.208
(dramatic music)

17:55.242 --> 17:59.146
*

18:05.017 --> 18:06.919
MICHAEL: Wait, wait, wait,
hold on.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.821
She didn't say anything else?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.557
-Completely shut down.
-Oh, come on.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.159
I know I shouldn't be
mad at her, but--

18:12.192 --> 18:14.627
Wait, let me skip right
to the end, brother.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.830
You should be.
We both should be.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.232
Well, my hands
aren't clean here.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.833
I've...

18:20.867 --> 18:22.669
hid things too,
from a lot of people.

18:22.702 --> 18:26.173
Which she knew before she even
walked down the aisle.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.341
Look, we told her our secrets.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.178
We spilled our guts, man.
And she told us nothing.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.613
Well, she did forgive us.

18:33.646 --> 18:34.781
Well,
I'm gonna forgive her, too,

18:34.814 --> 18:35.748
right after I finish
this bottle.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.983
(laughs)

18:37.016 --> 18:38.818
Moved my things
into Harry's room.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.155
Why'd you do that?

18:42.189 --> 18:44.157
So you'd have a place
to sleep of this bottle.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.193
(laughs)

18:46.226 --> 18:48.361
A guest in my own damn house.

18:48.395 --> 18:51.631
Hey, you know what, man?
I built this patio.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.832
And you did a great job.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.802
I know.
And you're welcome.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.604
-Wait, still no word from Mom?
-No.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.871
MAY: You know I could text her.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.207
Say I'm in the hospital,
or something.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.208
She'd come running.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.709
Then kill us all.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.211
-Yeah.
-MAY: She'd still come.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.345
She's my mom.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.284
Hey, May, can you keep
an eye on your dad?

19:11.318 --> 19:12.285
I'll be right back.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.353
MAY: Where you going?

19:13.386 --> 19:15.255
Calling reinforcements.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.493
(indistinct radio chatter)

19:20.527 --> 19:22.362
MCCLUSKEY:
12 Adam 30, we are Code 6.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.298
I repeat, we are Code 6.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.834
Out of car on investigation?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.136
Except we're neither.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.904
What central don't know
won't hurt 'em.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.042
Okay,
so what are we looking for?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.145
Him.
Police 101.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.214
Follow the money.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.823
How do you know
he bought it here?

19:50.857 --> 19:53.226
The guy made multiple ATM
withdrawals to pay for it.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.195
Last one?
From the ATM cross the street.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.198
An hour later,
he's in his car with this gun

19:59.232 --> 20:01.768
on his way to kill his boss.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.536
How could I know
that would happen?

20:03.570 --> 20:06.773
It's called a 10-day
waiting period.

20:08.475 --> 20:11.911
I got a lot of friends
who can do me a lot of favors,

20:11.944 --> 20:14.447
but I won't help you
if you don't help me.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.316
Tell me where you got this gun.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.118
Come on.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.289
Couple came in
a couple of weeks back.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.757
Said they found it
in the attic.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.394
Name and address
is probably fake.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.796
But the thumb print is real.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.265
It's the girlfriend's.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.468
Marianna Petrossian.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.470
LAPD.
I'm looking for your boyfriend.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.705
Which one?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.273
The one who used
your fingerprint

20:40.307 --> 20:43.643
to pawn a murder weapon
at Ray's Loan and Collateral.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.279
MCCLUSKEY: (chuckling)
Come on. Criminals are dumb.

20:46.313 --> 20:47.714
They won't ever admit that.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.449
I mean, they all think
they're geniuses.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.451
Smarter than us for damn sure.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.386
Sounds like you admire that.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.721
MCCLUSKEY:
I find it useful.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.823
Always let them think
they have the upper hand.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.492
Right until you take them down.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.595
Modest little number.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.397
Not your standard stock
and trade.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.132
Where'd you get it?

21:06.165 --> 21:08.401
Are you sure I did?

21:08.435 --> 21:10.837
Because I have been having
quite the day.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.139
The most recent owner led me
to a thumb print,

21:13.172 --> 21:15.074
which got me to a girl
whose father bought it

21:15.107 --> 21:17.510
from a co-worker
who took it in a divorce.

21:17.544 --> 21:20.413
The ex-wife picked it up
at a gun show

21:20.447 --> 21:22.982
from a dealer
who got it from a collector

21:23.015 --> 21:24.951
who claimed he bought it
on the street.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.654
Check this...
your street.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.660
I did a favor for a single mom.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.762
You're a detective?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.263
LAPD, ma'am.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.465
About the gun?

21:38.498 --> 21:39.666
My ex gave it to me.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.300
For protection.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.202
I always kept it
in the gun safe.

21:43.235 --> 21:46.773
I locked and unlocked
that thing a million times.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.740
Be careful.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.611
Never realized
the kids saw me doing it.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.380
That they knew
the combination.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.347
(gunshot echoes)

21:56.315 --> 21:58.050
I just...I got rid of it.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.219
Do you know where
your ex got it?

22:00.252 --> 22:01.388
His cousin.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.622
Maurizio.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.791
I didn't get it from anyone.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.892
I found it.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.360
You found it?

22:07.394 --> 22:09.295
Yeah. My first big job.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.063
A motel.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.865
I was prepping
one of the rooms.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.567
Took off a vent cover, and...

22:14.601 --> 22:16.202
ATHENA: Remember which motel?

22:16.235 --> 22:18.871
They may still have records.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.507
I doubt it.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.241
It was the Crestview
on Crenshaw.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.211
(sighs) They tore that down
ten years ago.

22:25.244 --> 22:27.013
Said they were building
a shopping center,

22:27.046 --> 22:29.015
and they never did.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.150
The lot's just dead.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.053
(dramatic music)

22:39.759 --> 22:41.628
Something smells good.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.100
Mama?

22:48.134 --> 22:50.537
Heard your life blew up again.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.473
*

23:00.212 --> 23:01.981
(footsteps approaching)

23:02.982 --> 23:04.884
Hey, hey.

23:07.454 --> 23:10.289
Don't be too hard on Bobby.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.192
You worried about him?
(laughs)

23:13.225 --> 23:14.727
That's new.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.863
He showed more sense
than you ever have.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.298
Calling me.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.468
Admitting he needed help.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.202
You can't help with this, Mama.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.773
All these years
I respected your wishes.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.408
I never spoke of Emmett.

23:29.442 --> 23:32.044
Thought it would let you heal.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.780
But you never did.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.917
It sounds silly.

23:39.619 --> 23:43.222
But I thought maybe if I could
find the man who killed him,

23:43.255 --> 23:46.993
Emmett would finally
be at peace.

23:47.026 --> 23:47.994
Baby.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.331
He's been at peace for decades.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.701
You're the one
still battling this.

23:56.469 --> 23:59.606
It was not your fault.

23:59.639 --> 24:02.108
He was there because of me,
Mama.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.776
Because he loved you.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.679
And you loved him.

24:06.713 --> 24:10.650
Wherever he is now,
he knows what I know.

24:10.683 --> 24:14.954
You would have taken
that bullet for him.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.924
(melancholy music)

24:17.957 --> 24:24.664
*

24:29.035 --> 24:31.437
I just don't know
how to tell them.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.873
I don't even know
where to begin.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.880
Maybe you can start there.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.668
Wow.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.705
BEATRICE: So handsome.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.507
The son I always wanted.

25:08.541 --> 25:09.909
HARRY: Wow.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.911
So I could've had
a completely different dad.

25:11.944 --> 25:15.147
No. No, you couldn't.

25:15.181 --> 25:18.417
You'd be a completely
different person.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.852
You are who you are

25:19.886 --> 25:21.253
because of your dad and me

25:21.287 --> 25:23.089
and who we were
when we had you.

25:26.893 --> 25:31.030
I have regrets about Emmett
and how he died, but...

25:31.063 --> 25:33.499
I do not regret this family.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.501
I love you all,

25:35.534 --> 25:39.772
and I could not imagine
my life without you in it.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.175
We all love you, too.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.112
(poignant music)

25:46.145 --> 25:49.582
*

25:49.616 --> 25:51.383
I'm sorry, Mom.

25:51.417 --> 25:52.585
I wish we had known
about him sooner.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.353
Oh.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.589
MICHAEL: Hey, but we know now.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.725
And we do not want you
to put this in a box

25:58.758 --> 25:59.992
for another 30 years.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.230
BOBBY: Go get your answers,
Athena.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.498
We'll all be here
when you're done.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.972
I really appreciate
your helping me with this.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.140
I know it's a long shot.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.374
Of course.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.709
How long of a shot
are we talking about?

26:16.743 --> 26:17.944
(laughs)

26:17.977 --> 26:21.213
'91? We don't keep calls
that far back.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.549
Uh, not the audio.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.451
You know what?
We'll still have the logs.

26:25.484 --> 26:27.019
Okay.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.389
Wow, that is a lot of calls.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.958
Can you filter by location?

26:31.991 --> 26:34.861
Crestview Motel on Crenshaw.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.231
Just under 2,000 calls
from '91 to '96.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.567
2,000? I thought the motel
was in L.A.,

26:41.600 --> 26:42.735
not a war zone.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.070
Early '90s,

26:44.103 --> 26:46.338
a little hard to tell
the difference sometimes.

26:46.372 --> 26:49.308
Okay,
all I'm seeing here are date,

26:49.341 --> 26:52.779
time, address, and some code.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.480
How can we get
more information?

26:54.513 --> 26:55.648
I put in a request.

26:55.682 --> 26:56.849
They bring it up
from the warehouse.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.150
Bring what up?

27:00.619 --> 27:04.323
So do you want to start
at the beginning or the end?

27:06.558 --> 27:08.327
Both.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.664
We can meet in the middle.
Okay.

27:11.698 --> 27:14.300
BESSIE: * I want to rap
that jack, sometimes *

27:14.333 --> 27:16.769
* I get a hump in my back,
sometimes *

27:16.803 --> 27:19.105
* I'm going over here,
sometimes *

27:19.138 --> 27:21.507
* Can my honey come back,
sometimes *

27:21.540 --> 27:23.776
* I want to rap that jack,
sometimes *

27:23.810 --> 27:26.045
* I get a hump in my back,
sometimes *

27:26.078 --> 27:28.147
* I'm going over here,
sometimes *

27:28.180 --> 27:30.850
* Can my honey come back,
sometimes *

27:30.883 --> 27:33.285
* I want to rap that jack,
sometimes *

27:33.319 --> 27:35.487
* I get a hump in my back,
sometimes *

27:35.521 --> 27:37.890
* I'm going over here,
sometimes *

27:37.924 --> 27:40.326
* Can my honey come back,
sometimes *

27:40.359 --> 27:42.228
* I want to rap that jack,
sometimes *

27:42.261 --> 27:44.831
* I get a hump in my back,
sometimes *

27:44.864 --> 27:47.399
* I'm going over here,
sometimes *

27:47.433 --> 27:49.535
* Can my honey come back,
sometimes *

27:49.568 --> 27:50.737
* I want to rap that jack

27:50.770 --> 27:53.472
Athena, there were two calls
from the Crestview

27:53.505 --> 27:56.976
on the same night
within an hour of each other.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.012
February 17, 1991.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.181
Does that date
mean something to you?

28:05.852 --> 28:07.820
Yeah.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.857
Uh, okay, 10:22 p.m.,
a noise complaint.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.826
Report of a man screaming
and banging on the walls.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.227
Caller didn't leave a name.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.528
It was a low-priority call,

28:16.562 --> 28:18.865
so I'm not sure
a unit was dispatched.

28:18.898 --> 28:22.268
And then 11:14 p.m.,

28:22.301 --> 28:24.270
call came
from the motel manager.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.338
Overdose.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.940
Uh, victim?

28:27.974 --> 28:31.077
African-American male,
early 20s,

28:31.110 --> 28:33.579
police and medical
were dispatched to the scene,

28:33.612 --> 28:36.282
treated subject
for suspected heroin overdose

28:36.315 --> 28:38.084
and hand lacerations.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.819
(camera shutter clicking)

28:41.720 --> 28:44.256
-Did he--
-Transported to King General.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.626
Alive.

28:47.659 --> 28:50.629
(melancholy music)

28:50.662 --> 28:55.868
*

28:55.902 --> 28:57.169
I found him.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.443
Hey, you think your mom
would be good

29:04.476 --> 29:06.145
with that Chinese place
on Slauson,

29:06.178 --> 29:07.613
or should I be
thinking fancier?

29:07.646 --> 29:09.548
No, I'm sure that's fine.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.317
Okay, I'll see you in 20.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.985
ATHENA: Wait, no.
Uh...

29:13.019 --> 29:17.123
I forgot to get cream
for Mama's coffee.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.591
Could you stop by on your way
over and pick some up, please?

29:19.625 --> 29:21.560
EMMETT: And rack up
some future son-in-law points?

29:21.593 --> 29:22.628
Absolutely.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.430
(both laugh)

29:24.463 --> 29:25.631
I'll see you soon.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.135
That bought us some more time.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.103
BEATRICE: I'm not sure
we need it.

29:31.137 --> 29:34.173
The fit is perfect.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.474
Ah.

29:36.976 --> 29:40.079
Oh, he's a good man.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.983
You're gonna have
a wonderful life together.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.859
Emmett should've been here
by now.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.163
(phone rings)

29:57.196 --> 29:58.330
Hello?

30:00.532 --> 30:03.435
Yes, this is Athena Carter.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.973
(sirens wailing)

30:07.006 --> 30:10.042
(dramatic music)

30:10.076 --> 30:12.979
(indistinct chatter, echoing)

30:13.012 --> 30:19.751
*

30:28.660 --> 30:29.628
Athena?

30:29.661 --> 30:30.863
Yeah.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.364
I'm Elaine.

30:32.398 --> 30:35.067
I'll, uh, walk you in.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.250
Looks like
he walked into a robbery.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.854
Wrong place,
wrong time.

30:58.457 --> 31:05.231
*

31:09.601 --> 31:10.736
I can have someone
drive you home.

31:10.769 --> 31:11.703
No.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.408
Someone needs to tell
his mother.

31:33.993 --> 31:40.732
*

31:43.002 --> 31:44.836
(dog barking)

31:49.408 --> 31:52.244
(footsteps approaching)

31:55.647 --> 31:58.650
DENNIS:
Boy, don't you open that door.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.220
Get out of here.
Can I help you?

32:01.253 --> 32:03.990
Sergeant Grant, LAPD.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.624
Uh-oh.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.126
Which one of my kids
is in trouble?

32:08.660 --> 32:09.962
I work with at-risk kids.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.597
I see a lot of you guys.

32:11.630 --> 32:12.831
I figured that's why
you're here.

32:12.864 --> 32:17.436
I'm here about the night
of February 17, 1991.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.275
(melancholy music)

32:23.309 --> 32:30.049
*

32:42.828 --> 32:44.896
DENNIS: I remember when
the police released this.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.168
I was panicked.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.770
Convinced someone
would recognize me.

32:51.803 --> 32:55.174
For months, I was terrified
to walk down the street.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.311
I thought they'd send
more of you.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.780
I'm not here for them.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.482
I'm here for me.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.323
(sighs)
You're her.

33:11.357 --> 33:16.162
Officer Washington is survived
by his mother Tina...

33:16.195 --> 33:19.131
and his fiancÃ©e Athena Carter.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.700
Is that supposed to make me
feel better?

33:21.733 --> 33:24.303
That you memorized
his damn obituary?

33:24.336 --> 33:27.239
No. It just...

33:27.273 --> 33:31.043
I wanted you to know
that I never forgot about him.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.145
And I never forgot about
what I did that night.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.047
Me neither.

33:36.082 --> 33:39.885
You spent months afraid
you'd be recognized?

33:39.918 --> 33:43.655
I spent years searching
every face I saw.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.657
Wondering was that man the one?

33:45.691 --> 33:48.527
Was his face the last thing
that Emmett saw before he died?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.362
(sniffles)

33:50.396 --> 33:52.931
You have no idea what decades

33:52.964 --> 33:55.801
of not knowing
does to a person.

33:57.703 --> 34:01.207
I'm not here for your excuses
or your apologies.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.909
I'm only here
for your knowledge.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.545
What happened that night?

34:09.115 --> 34:11.417
I was out of my mind.

34:12.418 --> 34:16.622
I was consumed with no thought
beyond getting my next fix.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.291
It seemed easy enough.

34:19.325 --> 34:21.993
The store had money.
I had a gun.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.367
But he was moving too slow,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.169
and my brain
was moving too fast.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.606
I didn't even remember
pulling the trigger.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.145
He was dead before I knew

34:39.178 --> 34:41.113
there was another person
in the store.

34:43.014 --> 34:45.717
I woke up in the hospital
four nights later.

34:45.751 --> 34:49.121
And that's when I found out
I had killed a cop.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.658
I thought
they would come for me,

34:52.691 --> 34:54.059
but they never did.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.562
You could've
turned yourself in.

34:56.595 --> 35:00.499
I told myself that God
had given me another chance.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.834
And I took it.

35:02.868 --> 35:06.037
I got clean,
and I went to church...

35:07.773 --> 35:10.942
And I tried to live
a life of service.

35:10.976 --> 35:14.280
I tried to live
a life in service.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.515
For the life I took.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.917
And I know this
don't mean much--

35:18.950 --> 35:21.620
It doesn't mean anything.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.655
He was trying to help someone,

35:23.689 --> 35:26.292
and you killed him for it.

35:26.325 --> 35:29.361
But you didn't take
just one life.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.863
For his mother...

35:31.897 --> 35:34.666
his friends, for me,
you were a wrecking ball,

35:34.700 --> 35:37.102
tearing through our lives.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.005
But we managed to put
the pieces back together.

35:40.038 --> 35:43.542
But there will always
be cracks.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.844
I'm sorry.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.614
You claim you're a good man...

35:48.647 --> 35:50.882
now.

35:50.916 --> 35:54.386
But Emmett
was always a good man.

35:54.420 --> 35:58.224
Oh, he believed
in second chances, too.

35:58.257 --> 36:01.026
He'd be impressed
with the life you've built.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.163
But you built it
on the back of a dead man,

36:05.197 --> 36:07.666
and I, for one,
can't get past that.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.571
(sniffles)

36:15.441 --> 36:18.910
You have carried my burden
for almost 30 years.

36:20.712 --> 36:23.515
It's time you let me
take it back.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.522
(static, indistinct chatter)

36:30.556 --> 36:32.391
(Beatrice grunts)

36:32.424 --> 36:34.726
Oh, God.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.595
Ooh.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.664
Athena.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.931
Ooh.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.601
I talked to that
moving company today.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.771
They're coming by tomorrow
to give us a quote.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.680
(dramatic music)

36:54.713 --> 36:56.282
Oh, my God.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.784
What is this?

36:58.817 --> 37:01.887
Traffic stop gone wrong.
Someone got it on video.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.726
They're gonna kill him.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.396
No. Reporters said he's alive.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.966
BEATRICE:
I'm glad you're coming home.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.868
I'd hate to have you out there.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.571
I'm not.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.140
I'm not going with you, Mama.

37:22.173 --> 37:25.344
I'm staying here.
I'm going back to the job.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.749
What are you talking about?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.951
I joined the force
for a reason.

37:32.984 --> 37:36.588
You joined for a man
who's dead.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.757
Don't follow him
into the grave!

37:45.130 --> 37:50.636
You have no idea who I am,
do you?

37:50.669 --> 37:52.438
You're my daughter,

37:52.471 --> 37:55.607
and you are not staying here
to be a part of that.

37:55.641 --> 37:58.644
That is why
I need to stay here.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.779
So there can be
more officers like me

38:00.812 --> 38:02.481
and less like them.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.082
What difference does that make?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.417
Those cops...

38:05.451 --> 38:07.419
they think they're doing
the right thing.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.821
Someone needs to show them
that they are wrong.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.125
You're a fool,
and I cannot allow you.

38:14.159 --> 38:16.061
It is not your decision, Mama.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.966
And it is not your business.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.343
Okay.
We'll be there soon.

38:34.245 --> 38:38.116
ANDRA: * You're broken down
and tired *

38:38.149 --> 38:42.454
* Of living life
on a merry-go-round *

38:42.488 --> 38:46.291
* And you can't find
the fighter *

38:46.324 --> 38:50.295
* But I see it in you
so we gonna walk it out *

38:50.328 --> 38:54.299
* Move mountains

38:54.332 --> 38:56.635
I'm ready.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.169
ANDRA:
* We gonna walk it out

38:58.203 --> 39:02.808
* And move

39:02.841 --> 39:05.043
* Mountains

39:05.076 --> 39:07.379
* And I'll rise up

39:07.413 --> 39:09.715
* I'll rise like the day

39:09.748 --> 39:11.483
* I'll rise up

39:11.517 --> 39:13.585
* I'll rise unafraid

39:13.619 --> 39:15.854
* I'll rise up

39:15.887 --> 39:21.326
* And I'll do it
a thousand times again *

39:21.359 --> 39:23.895
* And I'll rise up

39:23.929 --> 39:25.697
* High like the waves

39:25.731 --> 39:27.766
* I'll rise up

39:27.799 --> 39:29.768
* In spite of the ache

39:29.801 --> 39:32.170
* I'll rise up

39:32.203 --> 39:37.776
* And I'll do it
a thousand times again *

39:37.809 --> 39:41.880
* For you

39:41.913 --> 39:46.217
* For you

39:46.251 --> 39:49.955
* For you

39:49.988 --> 39:55.527
* For you

39:55.561 --> 39:59.631
* When the silence
isn't quiet *

39:59.665 --> 40:03.802
* And it feels like
it's getting hard to breathe *

40:03.835 --> 40:07.606
* And I know
you feel like dying *

40:07.639 --> 40:11.309
* But I promise we'll take
the world to its feet *

40:11.342 --> 40:15.547
* Move

40:15.581 --> 40:18.049
* Mountains

40:18.083 --> 40:19.651
* Bring it to its feet

40:19.685 --> 40:24.556
* Move

40:24.590 --> 40:26.458
* Mountains

40:26.492 --> 40:28.794
* And I'll rise up

40:28.827 --> 40:30.796
* I'll rise like the day

40:30.829 --> 40:32.564
* I'll rise up

40:32.598 --> 40:34.800
* I'll rise unafraid

40:34.833 --> 40:37.235
* I'll rise up

40:37.268 --> 40:41.006
* And I'll do it
a thousand times again *

40:41.039 --> 40:43.008
Can I help you?

40:43.041 --> 40:46.778
ANDRA: * For you

40:46.812 --> 40:48.980
* For you

40:49.014 --> 40:50.315
Athena.

40:51.483 --> 40:55.120
ANDRA: * For you

40:55.153 --> 40:57.789
What are you doing here?

40:57.823 --> 40:59.858
We made an arrest.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.861
Oh, no, no.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.429

41:04.462 --> 41:06.832
Oh, baby.

41:06.865 --> 41:10.502
ANDRA: * And for that
we have each other *

41:10.536 --> 41:12.237
Oh.

41:13.639 --> 41:16.708

41:16.742 --> 41:18.644
ANDRA: * We will rise

41:18.677 --> 41:20.278
