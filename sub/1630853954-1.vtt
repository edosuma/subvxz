Sophie: They're not
as nihilistic

02:01.453 --> 02:02.688
as they look on the Internet.

02:02.722 --> 02:05.524
That's just, like,
what they want you to think.

02:05.558 --> 02:08.728
So, David thinks
you're a childhood friend.

02:08.761 --> 02:11.931
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
he actually was, um,

02:11.964 --> 02:14.399
my preschool boyfriend.

02:14.432 --> 02:17.268
Of course, before I realized
that I was a raging dyke.

02:19.739 --> 02:20.740
Wow.

02:22.975 --> 02:25.410
They all look so impressive.

Yeah, sure.

02:28.346 --> 02:29.582

04:21.627 --> 04:22.995

04:23.929 --> 04:24.930

06:06.799 --> 06:07.943
David: What the fuck?
It's Sophie.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.101
Sophie: Bitch!
Oh...

06:09.134 --> 06:10.169
What is she doing here?

06:10.202 --> 06:11.604
I don't know.
Alice: Oh, oh...

06:11.637 --> 06:13.172
Hello!

06:13.205 --> 06:15.941
Sophie: You got me soaking
wet, you bad little girl.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.978
Alice: Come here...
Greg: Whoo, boy!

06:19.011 --> 06:20.079
Hey, did I win?

06:20.112 --> 06:21.013
Yes, Greg.

06:21.046 --> 06:22.815
I told you guys.
I got really big lungs!

06:22.848 --> 06:23.849
David: I know.

06:46.538 --> 06:47.573
Alice: Oh, my god.

06:47.606 --> 06:48.750
I can't believe
you're here, like,

06:48.774 --> 06:49.808
last time I saw you,

06:49.842 --> 06:51.086
you were coked out
on the subway,

06:51.110 --> 06:52.811
pissing on the floor
like a little hyena.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.479
I thought you
were an nyu student.

06:54.513 --> 06:56.048
Oh, my god.

06:56.081 --> 06:58.751
And that is why we do not let
the henny monster out anymore.

06:58.784 --> 07:00.719
No, no!

07:00.753 --> 07:02.154
Okay, but, seriously,
how are you?

07:02.187 --> 07:03.956
I'm good. Yeah.
Yeah?

07:03.989 --> 07:06.058
Yeah, i'm, like, really good.
Good. Good.

07:06.091 --> 07:07.960
You look so good.

07:07.993 --> 07:09.828
I miss you!
I miss you too.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.497
Also, I have to say,
love the podcast.

07:12.531 --> 07:14.800
Okay, we have a fan of the pod.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.201
We love the podcast.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.469
Alice: A fan of the pod.

07:18.504 --> 07:20.139
Oh, my god!
It's so good to see you!

07:20.172 --> 07:22.574
I can't believe that
you're here! It's, like, what?

07:22.608 --> 07:25.811
Hi. Hi, I'm Emma.
Hi.

07:25.844 --> 07:27.746
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.548
That was so rude of me.
I'm Alice.

07:29.581 --> 07:32.151
You guys, this is bee.

07:32.184 --> 07:33.585
Bee, this is everyone.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.696
That's David, my best friend

07:34.720 --> 07:36.255
in the whole, whole,
whole wide world.

07:36.288 --> 07:37.556
That's Emma.

07:37.589 --> 07:39.024
That's Jordan, and...

07:40.659 --> 07:42.094
'Sup! I'm Greg.

07:42.127 --> 07:43.929
'Sup, player! I'm Sophie.

07:44.630 --> 07:45.664
Oh!

07:45.698 --> 07:48.734
Whoa. You're Sophie?

07:56.608 --> 07:58.544
Real nice of you
to make it, soph.

07:58.577 --> 08:00.879
Ooh, spicy, spicy, Jordan.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.715
What is that supposed to mean?

08:02.748 --> 08:04.683
Jordan: Just means that
we have all been here

08:04.717 --> 08:06.952
and nobody had any fucking
clue that you were coming.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.520
Let alone, an hour before

08:08.554 --> 08:10.089
the storm is supposed
to start, so...

08:10.122 --> 08:13.959
What? I totally
told you guys

08:13.993 --> 08:14.994
that I was coming.

08:15.794 --> 08:17.029
And I texted you.

08:17.062 --> 08:18.230
In the group chat?
Yeah.

08:18.263 --> 08:19.298
No, you didn't.
Whatever,

08:19.331 --> 08:23.202
you guys know that i'm
useless with text, right?

08:23.235 --> 08:24.346
Also, we meant
to come up yesterday,

08:24.370 --> 08:27.039
but then bee got scheduled
for a shift at work, so...

08:27.072 --> 08:28.941
Oh, where do you work?

08:28.974 --> 08:31.610
Gamehut.
Emma: Oh, nice.

08:31.643 --> 08:33.212
Alice: Why are you guys
being so weird?

08:33.245 --> 08:34.780
Are you talking about me?

08:34.813 --> 08:37.182
What are you doing
with that champagne?
Alice: Guys!

08:37.216 --> 08:39.159
You know you're not supposed
to touch my dad's shit.

08:39.183 --> 08:41.153
Sophie is here.
Okay, it's Sophie.

08:41.186 --> 08:42.755
It's a once in a
millennium sighting.

08:42.788 --> 08:43.856
We're doing it.
David: No.

08:43.889 --> 08:45.090
Yes, come on.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.226
Who wants to pop it?
Greg: I'll do it.

08:47.259 --> 08:48.937
Greg, you'll help me pop it?
Yeah, I'll pop it.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.029
Okay.
Yeah.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.797
Bee: I, um...

08:51.830 --> 08:52.965
I brought something.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.735
Oh! What, uh... what is it?

08:56.769 --> 09:00.205
It's, uh, zucchini. A bread.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.775
It's zucchini bread.
David: Thank you.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.076
Yum.

09:04.109 --> 09:05.611
Hey, nerds.
Emma: That's sweet.

09:09.815 --> 09:12.051
Oh, my, god! Oh, my god!

09:12.084 --> 09:13.919
How did you do that?

09:13.952 --> 09:15.087
Did you see that?
All right.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.364
It's not that cool.
That was crazy.

09:16.388 --> 09:17.823
Alice: Oh, my god!

09:17.856 --> 09:19.024
Emma: Wow.
Wow.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.627
That was so sick. I can't
believe we didn't video that.

09:21.660 --> 09:22.837
Give me my dad's Gurkha sword.

09:22.861 --> 09:23.929
Gimme that.
Here, man.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.840
Fuck, that was so good.
I just found it on the wall.

09:25.864 --> 09:27.666
Yeah, don't grab
shit off my wall.

09:27.699 --> 09:29.001
Whoa! Eh, careful
with that pour,

09:29.034 --> 09:30.702
the shits expensive.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.838
All right, all right.
There we go. There we go.

09:32.871 --> 09:34.139
Thanks.
Really impressive.

09:34.173 --> 09:35.607
David: Nice pouring.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.643
Soph, you want?
I'm sober.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.679
Yay!
No, thanks.

09:40.712 --> 09:42.281
Congrats.

09:42.314 --> 09:44.116
Greg: Cheers.
Emma: Cheers.

09:44.149 --> 09:45.660
Greg: To hurricanes!

09:45.684 --> 09:47.019
Jordan: To hurricane parties!

09:47.052 --> 09:48.954
Greg: Yeah.
Jordan: To hurricanes.

09:48.987 --> 09:50.255
To hurricanes.

09:50.289 --> 09:51.323
Jordan: Deep.

09:57.162 --> 09:58.997
Guys it's starting!

10:02.267 --> 10:03.869
Party time!

10:03.902 --> 10:05.037
Starting.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.306
Shit. Fuck.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.711
Okay, what's going on with Max?

10:12.744 --> 10:13.580
Nothing.
Where is he?

10:13.612 --> 10:15.747
He's just taking a break.
He'll be back.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.849
What does that mean?

10:18.217 --> 10:21.353
Is that all you got,
motherfucker!

10:27.893 --> 10:29.261
Let's go!

10:40.839 --> 10:42.774
Hey, fuckface!

10:42.808 --> 10:43.909
Can we talk for a second?

10:43.942 --> 10:46.245
Can you knock?
No, it's my house.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.080
Sure. What's up?

10:48.113 --> 10:49.948
In private.
Oh!

10:49.982 --> 10:51.083
Sure.

10:52.384 --> 10:54.052
I'm sorry. He'll learn.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.088
I'll be right back.

10:56.121 --> 10:58.161
David: Yeah, that's what
Tom Hanks said in <i>castaway.</i>

10:59.358 --> 11:00.959
<i>She's actually really cute.</i>

11:00.993 --> 11:03.362
In like a school shooter
type of way.

11:03.395 --> 11:06.865
"Brought you
zucchini bread, Dave."

11:06.899 --> 11:08.233
She's mine. Hands off.

11:26.785 --> 11:27.819
Jordan: Hey.

11:29.788 --> 11:31.957
Oh, hi... I...

11:31.990 --> 11:33.892
Uh, I was just...
No, no, I know.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.329
It's beautiful. The house.

11:37.362 --> 11:39.698
Sophie's parents have one
that's even bigger.

11:44.803 --> 11:46.271
Just be careful, okay?

11:48.373 --> 11:49.942
With Sophie. Just...

11:53.212 --> 11:54.479
Be careful.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.315
Okay.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.885
Okay.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.330
But he's, like, not hot.
You know what I mean?

12:11.363 --> 12:12.464
He's like, like, your mom

12:12.497 --> 12:13.999
would be like,
"ooh, he's hot."

12:14.032 --> 12:16.335
Not your mom,
I mean moms in general.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.236
Moms that have been married

12:17.269 --> 12:19.171
for like 10, 15 years
and they see, like,

12:19.204 --> 12:20.839
him going out of a Starbucks...

12:20.872 --> 12:23.075
Alice got to bring someone
without telling anyone.

12:23.108 --> 12:24.042
So you do read the chat.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.144
Why is everyone
so obsessed with the chat?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.256
Now, you're here. I'm here,
we're here together, right?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.949
Why are we worrying
about the chat?

12:30.983 --> 12:32.417
When we can just
live in the moment.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.495
Yeah, it's 'cause
you went to rehab

12:33.519 --> 12:34.554
and you're not on drugs.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.454
So, like, everything is like,

12:35.487 --> 12:38.924
"ooh, why don't
we just all be cool, man?"

12:40.225 --> 12:41.860
You have a little problem
with Greg?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.296
The lumberjack.

12:44.329 --> 12:45.364
It's a new pod.

12:45.397 --> 12:47.933
I'm not used
to the inhaling yet.

12:47.966 --> 12:49.268
What is he, like, 40?

12:49.301 --> 12:50.579
I don't know.
I think Alice found him

12:50.603 --> 12:52.204
on tinder, or some shit.

12:52.237 --> 12:54.339
Apparently, he was
in Afghanistan.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.942
I think he was in the army,
or some shit, so...

12:56.975 --> 12:58.176
Well, that's hot.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.078
He's not...
He's not, like, that hot.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.356
You don't have to think
he's attractive,

13:01.380 --> 13:03.091
only Alice has to think
that he's attractive.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.349
Like, I feel, like,

13:04.383 --> 13:06.385
I'm more attractive than that.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.920
You do?
Absolutely.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.188
And what are the features

13:10.222 --> 13:11.366
that you're bringing
to the table?

13:11.390 --> 13:12.824
Well, I just look like I fuck.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.259
You know what I mean?
Mmm.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.361
I look like I... I fuck.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.497
And that's the vibe
I like to put out there.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.332
Yeah.
No, uh, yeah,

13:20.365 --> 13:22.176
he's, he's really
handsome. Whatever.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.978
I mean, we don't have to
talk about it all the time.

13:24.002 --> 13:25.380
What the fuck
happened to your face?

13:25.404 --> 13:26.271
Fucking Max.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.074
Max did that?
Yes, fucking Max, really.

13:29.107 --> 13:30.184
Okay? I was standing outside

13:30.208 --> 13:31.587
and he just ran up to me
and punched me in the eye.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.787
Just ran up to you?
He just did.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.490
Look at it.
He just came up to you
and did that, huh?

13:34.514 --> 13:35.890
I think it...
Actually think it looks

13:35.914 --> 13:37.617
kind of dope, though.
Don't you think?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.118
It's getting fucking darker.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.421
I look like a,
like a warrior. Right?

13:42.454 --> 13:43.998
Like, it's kind of...
It's kind of cool.

13:44.022 --> 13:45.190
Like, it's kind of hot.

13:45.223 --> 13:46.602
Like, if you saw me
coming out of a 7-Eleven,

13:46.626 --> 13:48.894
you'd be like...

13:50.462 --> 13:51.963
Um...

13:51.997 --> 13:54.366
So have you had a chance to, uh,

13:54.399 --> 13:55.934
talk to my parents at all?

13:59.037 --> 14:01.173
What the fuck
are you doing here, soph?

14:02.941 --> 14:04.409
I missed you.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.311
We both know that's a lie.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.946
Nobody's ever missed me.

14:51.289 --> 14:53.559
Ugh, no! Please, no!

14:58.263 --> 14:59.965
Ugh, my god,
can you turn that off?

14:59.998 --> 15:01.333
It's bumming me out.

15:01.366 --> 15:04.504
Yeah. You're right.
You're right.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.305
Hey, guys, can I...
Can I get on the Wi-Fi?

15:07.339 --> 15:09.975
Oh, god, I can never
remember the password.

15:10.008 --> 15:12.177
It's, like, an actually
good password.

15:12.210 --> 15:13.930
Jordan: I'll transfer it.
What's your email?

15:14.479 --> 15:16.047
Bee: Uh... what?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.650
What is your email?

15:19.317 --> 15:21.453
Hey...

15:23.321 --> 15:25.457
I'm sorry.
My service went out,

15:25.490 --> 15:27.292
but I am on a Wi-Fi now.

15:27.325 --> 15:30.162
So, that's good.

15:30.195 --> 15:32.665
Greg: I 100%
wanna do a tiktok.
All of you can do it.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.535
Okay. Do you know this?
Which one is it?

15:37.002 --> 15:38.179
Greg: I don't know
what I'm doing.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.481
Alice: Follow...
We'll watch it...

15:39.505 --> 15:41.106
You'll catch it. Yeah.

15:41.139 --> 15:44.176
Okay, ready, three, two...

15:44.209 --> 15:46.211
Emma: Keep up, keep up.

15:46.244 --> 15:47.713
Jordan: Go!
Emma: Look at you.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.785
Are we at the last part?

15:52.819 --> 15:54.754
Jordan: That was good.
That was good.
Okay.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.322
Greg went a little rogue
but we're checking the moves.

15:57.355 --> 15:59.458
Alice: No, you didn't.
Again, again, again.

15:59.491 --> 16:00.769
Emma: At the end
you go like this.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.595
Alice: Ready? Get ready.
You okay?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.530
Jordan: We should just,
just post it.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.497
Alice: It's very good.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.175
Jordan: I'm ready for
the flow. One more time!

16:07.199 --> 16:08.300
Three, two, one, go!

16:08.333 --> 16:09.602
Do you want a drink?

16:09.635 --> 16:10.703
Do you want something?

16:10.736 --> 16:12.270
Here you go. There we go!

16:12.304 --> 16:15.140
She's having a good time.

16:15.173 --> 16:16.241
Let's go!

16:16.274 --> 16:18.644
Yeah! Oh, my god.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.111
Okay, bitch.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.748
Alice: I make it very salty.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.216
It's incredibly salty.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.285
Emma: Is this your
first relationship?

16:29.555 --> 16:31.423
Uh, no.

16:31.456 --> 16:33.425
You just, kind of,
give that vibe.

16:34.392 --> 16:36.562
Not in a bad way.
Bee: Yeah.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.263
How long have
you guys been together?

16:39.197 --> 16:40.265
Oh, uh, six weeks.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.367
Nice.
Wow.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.236
Six weeks with Sophie.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.506
Alice.
In a good way, that's good.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.173
Are you from Moscow?

16:48.206 --> 16:50.075
Bee: No.
Oh.

16:50.108 --> 16:51.209
Bee: Why?

16:52.344 --> 16:54.045
<i>Doctor Zhivago</i>
is my favorite film.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.480
Alice: Ugh, my god,

16:55.515 --> 16:57.048
what is going on
with this storm?

16:57.082 --> 16:58.818
I'm, like, make up your mind.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.052
I want it to start,
like, pouring again

17:01.086 --> 17:04.055
so that we can go fucking crazy.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.325
Oh, you know that has
weed in it, right?

17:07.358 --> 17:09.361
Not a lot,
I just wanted to let you know.

17:09.394 --> 17:11.363
Just didn't want you
to go to town and then...

17:11.396 --> 17:12.955
Emma: Yeah.
Alice: You know what I mean?

17:14.398 --> 17:17.368
Ooh, we're getting
a lot of likes.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.818
Sophie: You need to chill out.

18:38.851 --> 18:39.885
David: I guess.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.486
No, I'm serious, you need to...

18:41.520 --> 18:42.855
You need to chill out.

18:46.592 --> 18:47.627
Okay?

18:49.895 --> 18:50.796

Silence!

19:25.831 --> 19:27.499
Jordan: What? Stop!

19:27.533 --> 19:29.300
Who wants to play
bodies bodies bodies?

19:29.334 --> 19:31.737
David: Ah, fuck!
Emma: Yes!

19:31.771 --> 19:33.806
Sophie: So, if you draw
the piece of paper

19:33.839 --> 19:35.473
that has the "x" on it,

19:35.508 --> 19:37.475
you are the murderer.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.310
And you have
to keep it a secret.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.947
Guys, I get so stressed out
every time we play this.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.348
Someone always ends up crying.

19:43.381 --> 19:44.717
Alice: You always
end up crying.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.653
Okay, I can access
my emotions easily.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.421
Alice: Very incredibly easily.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.322
She's an actress,
she always cries first.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.528
I'm just saying,
this game gets very ugly.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.228
Oh, my god, no, it does not.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.632
It gets ugly
when she ugly cries.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.634
Emma: Literally, every single
time we play,

20:01.667 --> 20:02.668
people start fighting.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.737
David: Yeah, well, that's
what makes it fun, Emma.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.743
Where's Max?

20:10.776 --> 20:12.477
He's not responding to my texts.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.746
Oh, Jesus...

20:20.786 --> 20:22.021
So, how do you play?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.924
Sophie: So, I'm gonna
hit the lights in a second.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.559
And if you are the murderer,

20:26.592 --> 20:28.994
you have to sneak around
and kill someone

20:29.028 --> 20:31.362
by, like, touching them
on the back.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.967
And then, everyone else
has to avoid being killed.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.836
And then, if you are killed,

20:36.869 --> 20:40.039
you have to fall down
and pretend you're dead.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.607
Alice: Like this.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.676
Greg: Cool.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.678
Hey, uh...
Alice, do you wanna...

20:45.711 --> 20:47.747
What?
David: Do you wanna...

20:47.780 --> 20:50.248
You know.
Oh! Excuse me, I have to go.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.951
It's an emergency.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.587
Excuse me.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.764
Jordan: The most
important part

20:55.788 --> 20:57.757
is if you do come across a body,

20:57.790 --> 20:59.725
you have to yell,
"bodies, bodies, bodies."

20:59.759 --> 21:00.960
And then, once that happens,

21:00.993 --> 21:02.327
we'll turn all
the lights back on

21:02.360 --> 21:04.663
and then we'll try
to figure out who did it.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.998
Could you hold this?

21:06.031 --> 21:07.600
Did Greg touch that?

21:07.633 --> 21:08.667
Oh, my god.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.603
You're being such a dick
about Greg.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.037
Just hold this.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.340
David...

21:15.373 --> 21:16.942
What?
I, ugh...

21:22.413 --> 21:23.783
Okay...

21:26.018 --> 21:27.520
Look, what the fuck's going on?

21:27.553 --> 21:28.954
Sophie: Come to the floor.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.022
Come to the floor.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.024
Jordan: Get your ass
over here, boy.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.427
Sophie: Okay.
All right.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.663
Jordan:
Who will do the honors?

21:38.531 --> 21:39.865
Oh...

21:39.899 --> 21:42.300
Get into it. Let's go.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.402
Jordan: Ow!

21:44.435 --> 21:46.939
Ahhh!

21:46.972 --> 21:48.841
Bitch.

21:48.874 --> 21:49.909
Alice: Are you mad at me?

21:49.942 --> 21:51.222
Jordan: No.
Alice: Okay.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.379
Bee: Ow!
Alice: Jordan!

21:54.412 --> 21:55.748
Sophie: Whoa.
What? It's the game.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.016
David: Wowza...

22:14.900 --> 22:17.136
Oh, my god...
Oh, come on!

22:17.169 --> 22:18.403
What was that?
Bee!

22:18.436 --> 22:19.446
You have to hit more.
You got to put

22:19.470 --> 22:21.507
some muscle into it.
You gotta...
Yeah, go for it.

22:21.540 --> 22:22.541
Yeah.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.410
Come on!

22:25.443 --> 22:26.521
Jordan: Slap him around,
he deserves it.

22:26.545 --> 22:27.513
David: Fucking hit me!

22:27.546 --> 22:29.615
Emma: He wants it.
Jordan: No, he deserves it.

22:29.648 --> 22:30.583
He really deserves it. Do it.

22:30.616 --> 22:31.993
If anyone deserves
to be hit, it should be him.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.853
Yeah.
Bee: Okay.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.554
Oh, for fuck sake like this.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.122
Alice: Oh, my god!

22:37.156 --> 22:38.991
Jordan: David!
David.

22:40.593 --> 22:41.894
See?
David.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.598
You're a fucking dick!

22:45.631 --> 22:47.099
What?

22:47.132 --> 22:48.834
You are such an asshole.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.011
I'm teaching her
how to play the game.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.469
Alice: Baby, stop, stop!

22:51.503 --> 22:53.505
Wait, guys,
someone has to hit me.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.074
Who's gonna hit me?

22:55.107 --> 22:56.374
Jordan: I'll do it.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.477
Emma: Ow!

23:00.980 --> 23:02.413
Thank you.
Jordan: You're welcome.

23:02.447 --> 23:03.448
Sophie: Okay!

23:03.481 --> 23:05.483
Are we ready to go?
Alice: Yes, let's fucking go.

23:05.517 --> 23:07.037
David: Yes.
Alice: Let's play the game.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.798
David: Holy shit!
I'm so fucked up.

23:43.789 --> 23:44.924
Ahh.

23:49.528 --> 23:50.663
You ready?

23:50.863 --> 23:52.031
Yes.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.808
Bee: Hey.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.906
Oh!

25:22.221 --> 25:23.689
Sophie: I see white man...

25:23.722 --> 25:25.290
Bodies, bodies, bodies!

25:28.227 --> 25:32.264
You guys! Over here.

25:33.198 --> 25:37.069
No!

25:37.102 --> 25:38.904
Jordan: All right,
who tried to take advantage

25:38.937 --> 25:40.739
of my body in the dark?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.207
Your wish, babe.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.978
Alice: Oh, why, god?
Why? He was so hot!

25:46.945 --> 25:48.881
Was it you?
No.

25:48.914 --> 25:51.750
Okay. So, do we have
any nominations?

25:51.784 --> 25:53.252
David: Emma
whoa.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.254
Wow, coming in hot.
What?

25:55.287 --> 25:57.890
Why?
Yup, I think it was Emma.

25:57.923 --> 25:59.691
Why do you think it was me?

25:59.725 --> 26:00.893
Alice: Yeah, David, why?

26:00.926 --> 26:02.361
David: Okay, well,
she just, like,

26:02.394 --> 26:05.097
agrees with everything
that everybody is saying.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.299
And that's her strategy
in this game

26:07.332 --> 26:09.001
and it works every single time.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.669
So, I'm just calling it now.
It's Emma.

26:10.702 --> 26:12.638
Sophie: Do we have
any other nominations?

26:12.671 --> 26:14.807
Um... yeah, David.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.351
David: Oh, come on.
It's low hanging fruit.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.077
I mean, he who casts
the first stone.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.845
Bee: Guys,
why isn't he moving?

26:20.679 --> 26:24.183
Greg?
Baby, get up.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.985
You don't have to keep
pretending for this long.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.621
Baby?
Come on, Greg.

26:29.655 --> 26:30.656
Alice: Greg...

26:31.190 --> 26:32.191
Greg...

26:33.225 --> 26:34.226
Get up.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.161
Wait.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.166
Greg?

26:42.301 --> 26:43.902
Greg!

26:43.936 --> 26:45.404
Greg, get up!

26:45.437 --> 26:46.839
Greg! He's not getting up.

26:46.872 --> 26:49.208
Hey, relax,
this always works. I know.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.844
Oh, hey!
Oh, my god.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.847
You really scared me with that.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.950
Emma: You're a little
trickster, Greg.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.651
Jordan: I know, Jesus Christ.

26:59.685 --> 27:01.720
Sophie: Cute.

27:01.753 --> 27:04.423
Okay, so... what about David?

27:04.456 --> 27:05.724
Alice:

27:05.757 --> 27:07.226
Wait, maybe it's Jordan.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.337
She's always really aggressive
when she's the killer.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.729
There you go.
What? No, I am not.

27:10.762 --> 27:11.730
You're lying.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.732
Your voice always goes
really high when you lie.

27:13.765 --> 27:15.734
No, it doesn't.
I... it... I've...

27:15.767 --> 27:17.803
It's definitely David.
Why are you yelling?

27:17.836 --> 27:19.013
That would be so fucking obvious

27:19.037 --> 27:20.839
if I were the killer,
which I'm not.

27:20.873 --> 27:21.983
I think you're digging yourself

27:22.007 --> 27:23.442
into a little hole here, Dave.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.078
David: Guys, Jesus Christ...

27:26.111 --> 27:27.946
The best defense
is a good offense.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.257
Hey, you shut up. You're not
supposed to talk. You're dead.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.358
The dead are actually
not supposed to speak.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.160
Oh, yeah, you... sorry, baby,
you can't. It's a rule.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.219
Oh, my b.
Yeah, no talking. Pack it up.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.093
David: What the fuck
does that even mean, Greg?

27:36.121 --> 27:37.756
What's up?

27:37.789 --> 27:39.791
"The best defense
is a good offense."

27:39.825 --> 27:41.793
What does that...
What does that mean?

27:41.827 --> 27:45.030
Oh, you know,
the best defense
is a good offense.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.169
What...
What does it mean, though?

27:52.204 --> 27:53.972
Uh, well...

27:54.006 --> 27:57.276
It, um... it means
that the best defense

27:58.377 --> 28:00.045
is a good offense.

28:00.078 --> 28:02.114
Right, right, I heard you.

28:02.147 --> 28:05.450
But, what does it mean
to you, Greg? Like...

28:05.484 --> 28:08.287
I don't know, could you
elaborate on it for us?

28:08.320 --> 28:09.821
Break it down.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.323
Yeah, sure.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.792
So, hey, look in sports,
there's...

28:15.127 --> 28:16.161
Oh, my god.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.796
You are such a fucking dick.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.198
Hey, this is a teaching moment.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.203
Oh, I see.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.471
You're fucking with me.

28:27.172 --> 28:28.440
No. No,

28:28.473 --> 28:29.908
I'm not fucking with you, Greg.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.144
I'm just having fun.

28:32.177 --> 28:34.379
We're all just
having a good time.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.781
Right, guys?

28:36.481 --> 28:37.716
Right, Greg?

28:47.292 --> 28:48.427
We're just having fun.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.407
You know,

29:02.441 --> 29:04.876
I think it's time for me
to put myself to bed.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.879
Jordan: Oh, come on, Greg.
Alice: Greg, no.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.248
Good night, Greg.

29:09.948 --> 29:11.083
You kids have fun.

29:11.116 --> 29:12.784
Sophie: Catch you later,
player.

29:12.818 --> 29:13.919
David: By the way,

29:13.952 --> 29:15.821
can I just point
all of our attention

29:15.854 --> 29:18.223
to the fact that Emma
hasn't said a fucking word.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.460
Alice: Whoa, you're right.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.528
Whoa, she hasn't!

29:22.562 --> 29:25.063
David: I'm just pointing out
the obvious. That's all.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.865
Look, she's doing
that swallowing thing.

29:26.898 --> 29:28.309
She always does that
when she's fucking nervous!

29:28.333 --> 29:29.344
Alice: Oh, my god!
Look, look!

29:29.368 --> 29:31.870
Oh, my god, you're doing it.
You're swallowing it.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.839
I'm not.
Alice: You are.

29:33.872 --> 29:35.508
Okay, I love you,
but when you swallow,

29:35.541 --> 29:37.009
it's just fucking...
Like, why?

29:37.042 --> 29:38.243
Swallowing is normal.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.387
It's a normal thing to do.
David: Yeah...

29:39.411 --> 29:41.322
It's very UN-attractive.
I don't know why you do it?

29:41.346 --> 29:44.816
Oh, my god. Is that why
you guys never have sex?

29:44.850 --> 29:46.952
What?
Alice.

29:46.985 --> 29:51.089
What? It's not a bad thing.
Some people have sex a lot.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.057
Some people have it less.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.960
Alice, what are you
talking about? We do.

29:54.993 --> 29:56.895
I have it a lot. Some...

29:56.928 --> 29:58.206
Are you fucking...
Sophie: Oh, my god.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.110
Are you fucking talking
about us behind my back?

30:01.033 --> 30:02.568
No.
Yes.

30:02.602 --> 30:03.902
Emma: No.
Yes.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.004
No, I'm not.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.239
I'm not! I'm not.

30:07.272 --> 30:08.283
I just...
David: That's just great.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.943
Emma: No, I... we...
I... you never really... I...

30:11.977 --> 30:13.879
I don't...
You're always gaslighting me.

30:13.912 --> 30:15.524
"Gaslight," shut up.
It's a fucking dumb word.

30:15.548 --> 30:16.716
Excuse me?

30:16.749 --> 30:19.351
Gaslight is, like, one of
the most over used words ever,

30:19.384 --> 30:21.587
to, like, the point
of annihilation.

30:21.621 --> 30:24.022
Okay, it doesn't mean
anything other than the fact

30:24.056 --> 30:25.525
that, like,
you read the Internet.

30:25.558 --> 30:28.026
Or, like, "congrats,
you have a Twitter account."

30:28.060 --> 30:30.195
Ugh, that is so fucking lame.

30:30.228 --> 30:31.306
David: "Gaslight,"
get over it.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.132
Like what's next?
You're gonna call me
a narcissist?

30:34.166 --> 30:36.968
Or a foot soldier of,
like, the white supremacy?

30:37.002 --> 30:39.004
Like, come on, fucking,
be more original.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.272
Sophie: Lame.

30:40.305 --> 30:41.316
David: What? I'm just saying,
that, this is what I'm saying,

30:41.340 --> 30:43.084
she doesn't have a thought
in her fucking head

30:43.108 --> 30:45.911
that hasn't been said
by anybody else.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.580
Nothing that isn't preordained.

30:48.648 --> 30:51.149
Alice: David,
that's really mean.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.884
Look, she's crying.

30:52.918 --> 30:54.086
David: What?

30:54.119 --> 30:55.296
Why is everybody
looking at me like that?

30:55.320 --> 30:57.255
This is not her real cry.

30:59.424 --> 31:00.425
I vote David.

31:01.393 --> 31:02.928
Yeah, me too.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.630
Are you fucking serious?

31:04.664 --> 31:05.964
Guys, it's Emma.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.501
She's an actress.
She's acting.

31:09.468 --> 31:10.302
Third.

31:10.335 --> 31:12.237
David: Wow,
how fucking surprising.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.206
Yeah, look at your
quivering upper lip.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.375
Like, we all didn't see you
in <i>hedda gabler.</i> Fuck you.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.176
Yeah, yeah, yup... fourth.

31:20.979 --> 31:22.615
Oh, my god.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.015
Fuck this game!

31:27.953 --> 31:29.054
Alice: Holy shit.

31:31.022 --> 31:33.392
Relationships can
be really complicated.

31:36.529 --> 31:38.196
Are you okay?

31:38.230 --> 31:39.599
I'm fine.
Are you sure?

31:39.632 --> 31:42.134
I'm fine. I'm 100% fine.
Are you sure, baby?

31:42.167 --> 31:43.636
Yes. Let's play.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.538
Ow!

31:46.405 --> 31:48.206
Alice: Wow, good one.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.176
Jordan: All of a sudden
she loves the game.

31:51.209 --> 31:53.378
Alice: That was crazy.

31:55.715 --> 31:56.915
Give it to me.

31:59.217 --> 32:00.318
Jordan: Damn!

32:02.120 --> 32:03.589
Alice: Ah! Oh, my god!

32:03.623 --> 32:04.657
Emma: What was that?

32:04.690 --> 32:06.434
Alice: What the fuck?
Jordan: Is that the lights?

32:06.458 --> 32:07.492
Emma: What was that?

32:07.527 --> 32:08.493
Sophie: Oh, my god.
Emma: Was that from the storm?

32:08.528 --> 32:10.530
Sophie: Oh, my god.
I bet you that it was David.

32:10.563 --> 32:12.264
David!
Jordan: It's not David.
Come on.

32:12.297 --> 32:13.331
I'm texting him.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.233
David, are you fucking with us?

32:15.267 --> 32:16.736
Turn the lights back on.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.538
Hey, does anybody have service?

32:18.571 --> 32:19.639
No!

32:19.672 --> 32:21.306
Ugh, wait, mine's not working.

32:21.339 --> 32:23.141
Okay, I think
the WiFi is also down.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.444
Oh, my god, i'm
gonna fucking kill him.

32:25.477 --> 32:28.079
Great!
David!

32:28.113 --> 32:30.516
David! This is
real fucking cute!

32:33.452 --> 32:35.597
Jordan: Soph, can he disable
the generator from garage,

32:35.621 --> 32:37.523
or the basement, or whatever?

32:37.557 --> 32:39.559
I don't know.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.094
David!

32:43.128 --> 32:46.264
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go and flip the breaker.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.009
Is it in the garage
or is it in the basement?

32:48.033 --> 32:49.234
David!
Jordan: Soph?

32:49.267 --> 32:50.479
Huh, what?
Jordan: Okay, whatever.

32:50.503 --> 32:52.505
Okay, I'm gonna go
get some more flashlights.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.272
Emma: I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.307
Where is a bathroom?

32:55.340 --> 32:58.410
Um, uh, downstairs,
first door on your right.

32:59.244 --> 33:00.345
Bee: Going there.

33:05.116 --> 33:06.485
Sophie: David?

33:11.089 --> 33:13.124
David, are you fucking with us?

34:15.888 --> 34:17.790
I meant the other stairs.

34:23.763 --> 34:25.831
David! David!

34:28.768 --> 34:31.402
Help! Somebody help!

34:32.404 --> 34:33.839
No, no, no.

34:33.873 --> 34:35.641
Alice: What the fuck happened?

34:35.675 --> 34:38.409
Oh, my god! Why would...

34:38.443 --> 34:40.813
Jordan: Check his pulse.
Sophie: What the fuck?

34:40.846 --> 34:42.748
Jordan: Oh, fuck!
Oh, my god!

34:42.782 --> 34:43.849
Hold his head up!

34:44.684 --> 34:46.552
Oh, my god!
Fuck!

34:46.585 --> 34:48.888
Fuck!
Alice: Is he dying?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.322
Hold his head up!
Emma: Come on, baby, hold on.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.868
Sophie: What the fuck
happened to his neck?

34:52.891 --> 34:54.560
I love you, David.
Shit.

34:54.594 --> 34:56.529
Alice: What is happening?

34:58.229 --> 34:59.799
Shit!

34:59.832 --> 35:01.534
Alice: What are you doing?
I'm calling 911!

35:01.567 --> 35:02.735
Oh, my god! You have service?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.269
Fuck, no! Do you?

35:04.302 --> 35:05.470
No!
Jordan: Shit!

35:05.504 --> 35:07.305
Where are you going?
Landline!

35:07.339 --> 35:08.774
We should move his body?

35:08.808 --> 35:11.242
Why?
I don't know. Because he's...

35:11.276 --> 35:12.477
Alice: No, you can't move him.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.279
Did you watch <i>svu?</i>
It's evidence.

35:14.312 --> 35:17.349
Of what?
Alice: Cause!

35:17.382 --> 35:19.317
Landline?
No, there's no connection.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.152
Sophie, where are your keys?

35:21.186 --> 35:22.521
Your keys, Sophie,
where are they?

35:22.555 --> 35:23.488
They're in the pocket.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.357
They're in her pocket...
Where? Fucking help!

35:25.390 --> 35:26.358
Alice: Where are you going?

35:26.391 --> 35:28.694
I'm going to the car.
Alice: To the car? Why?

35:28.728 --> 35:30.295
To get some fucking help.

35:30.328 --> 35:31.697
Wait, do you have a license?

35:31.731 --> 35:33.164
Doesn't she not have a license?

35:33.198 --> 35:34.700
I don't know.
I don't think so.

35:34.734 --> 35:36.569
Alice: Fuck!
Bee: He's dead!

35:36.602 --> 35:38.336
You have to go!
I don't know!

35:38.904 --> 35:40.640
He stopped breathing!

36:04.563 --> 36:05.698
Jordan: Branch!

36:28.353 --> 36:29.622
Alice: You have
to push the gas.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.757
Jordan: I know how
to fucking drive, Alice!

36:31.791 --> 36:33.626
I can't see.
Jordan: Is the battery dead?

36:34.794 --> 36:37.228
Bee: Oh, no...
Jordan: What?

36:37.262 --> 36:39.665
I, I think I left the light on,
on the mirror.

36:39.699 --> 36:42.467
Alice: Oh, Jesus Christ.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.269
Emma: What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

36:44.302 --> 36:45.805
Bee: Wait,
where are your cars?

36:45.838 --> 36:47.540
Alice: We...
We only have one car.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.275
Max picked us all up
and he fucking left!

36:50.308 --> 36:53.713
Jordan: Fuck, fuck, fuck!

37:04.957 --> 37:07.325
Max will probably
be here any minute, right?

37:07.358 --> 37:08.460
Where's Jordan?

37:09.628 --> 37:11.797
She went to check
the generator, I...

37:12.698 --> 37:14.900
What the fuck was he doing?

37:14.934 --> 37:16.978
What are you talking about?
Sophie: Fuck was he doing?

37:17.002 --> 37:19.605
Why the fuck was he
outside in the storm?

37:29.380 --> 37:30.716
Jordan: Hey!
It's me, let me in!

37:38.758 --> 37:39.892
I found this.

37:41.359 --> 37:42.628
Outside in the mud.

37:49.835 --> 37:50.936
Sophie: Don't touch it

37:50.970 --> 37:53.739
um, does the security system
work if the power goes out?

37:53.773 --> 37:55.473
Um...

37:55.508 --> 37:57.977
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

37:58.010 --> 37:59.477
David's dad explained it to us.

37:59.512 --> 38:00.622
Nobody can get in
without the code.

38:00.646 --> 38:01.814
Well, Max has the code.

38:02.615 --> 38:03.816
So...
Max wouldn't...

38:03.849 --> 38:06.852
I'm just saying, like,
where the fuck is he?

38:06.886 --> 38:08.721
Couldn't he have come back
after last night?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.321
Alice, stop.

38:13.659 --> 38:14.860
What happened last night?

38:14.894 --> 38:16.461
Nothing.
Alice: No.

38:16.494 --> 38:17.963
We did shrooms

38:17.997 --> 38:21.466
and Max told everybody
that he was in love with Emma.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.769
Which David thought
was beautiful in the moment,

38:23.803 --> 38:25.504
but maybe not today.

38:25.538 --> 38:27.640
Alice, that literally doesn't
fucking matter at all.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.341
Where is Greg? Where is he?

38:30.375 --> 38:31.911
What?
Jordan: Where is Greg?

38:31.944 --> 38:32.978
I...

38:33.012 --> 38:34.647
He said he was going to bed.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.381
So my guess would be
that he's sleeping.

38:36.414 --> 38:37.759
Okay, don't you think
it's a little bit strange

38:37.783 --> 38:39.652
that he hasn't, like,
woken up yet?

38:40.019 --> 38:41.319
Jordan,

38:42.054 --> 38:43.789
what are you trying to say.

38:43.823 --> 38:45.390
Maybe we should
just go check on him.

38:45.423 --> 38:46.659
Alice: No, no, no.

38:49.695 --> 38:50.830
Jordan...

38:50.863 --> 38:53.599
What are you doing?
Jordan... Jordan.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.767
What are you doing!

38:54.800 --> 38:56.101
I'm staying safe.
Alice: Really?

38:56.135 --> 38:57.212
Because it looks like
you're grabbing

38:57.236 --> 38:59.505
a fucking meat cleaver
to go look for my boyfriend!

38:59.538 --> 39:01.106
Wow. Boyfriend?

39:01.140 --> 39:02.584
That's the first time
I've heard you call him that.

39:02.608 --> 39:03.642
That's crazy.

39:03.676 --> 39:04.820
Alice: Don't be such a bitch.

39:04.844 --> 39:07.022
Jordan: Alice, I'm literally
just protecting myself, okay?

39:07.046 --> 39:09.815
Let me remind you,
our friend is dead.

39:09.849 --> 39:12.127
So, if you could just, like,
not escalate the situation...

39:12.151 --> 39:13.953
I'm not escalating.
You're holding the knife

39:13.986 --> 39:15.497
and you're moving your hands
while you talk.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.323
Alice, how long
have you known Greg?

39:19.191 --> 39:20.458
Like...

39:22.728 --> 39:23.829
Long.

39:24.797 --> 39:25.831
Alice.

39:26.765 --> 39:27.833
Ugh...

39:29.001 --> 39:31.103
I don't know exactly how long.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.638
I... Like...

39:33.606 --> 39:34.640
Two weeks.

39:34.673 --> 39:35.808
Jordan: Okay, uh...

39:35.841 --> 39:37.408
What do you know
about Greg, Alice?

39:37.442 --> 39:38.476
Oh, my god.

39:38.510 --> 39:39.621
Jordan: What do you
know about him?

39:39.645 --> 39:40.880
Oh, my god, guys!

39:40.913 --> 39:41.990
Sophie: Oh, my god!
Relax. Stop!

39:42.014 --> 39:44.550
Stop! Stop! I know that
he's a good person, okay?

39:44.583 --> 39:46.085
He's fundamentally
a good person.

39:46.118 --> 39:47.653
He wouldn't do this. Like, no.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.664
Do you know his middle name?
Do you know where he lives?

39:49.688 --> 39:51.523
Do you know how much
fucking money he makes?

39:51.557 --> 39:53.192
Do you know
his last name, Alice?

39:53.225 --> 39:54.693
I know a lot.

39:54.727 --> 39:57.062
Our first date was at...
Was at a bar.

39:57.096 --> 39:58.864
He drank, like,
a medium amount...

39:58.898 --> 40:00.008
Jordan: Okay, Alice... stop.
He likes nature.

40:00.032 --> 40:01.000
Jordan: What is his
middle name?

40:01.033 --> 40:01.934
He's a libra moon.
Jordan: Where does he live?

40:01.967 --> 40:03.011
You don't ask
what your middle name is!

40:03.035 --> 40:05.938
Okay? For a really long time.
Jordan: Oh... fuck!

40:07.773 --> 40:09.508
He's a libra moon.
That says a lot!

40:09.541 --> 40:10.709
Fuck!

40:14.479 --> 40:16.081
Greg!
Shh!

40:16.115 --> 40:17.726
Alice: What? You just said
we're looking for Greg!

40:17.750 --> 40:18.827
Okay, well
don't fucking, Alice...

40:18.851 --> 40:19.995
Greg! Can you come
into the kitchen?

40:20.019 --> 40:21.086
We need you for a second.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.155
Shut up.
Stop waving the knife at me!

40:23.188 --> 40:24.523
Fuck.
You're making me...

40:24.556 --> 40:26.058
Stop. Stop. Greg!

40:26.091 --> 40:27.559
Stop. Just stop.
Just be quiet.

40:27.593 --> 40:28.627
Stop. Stop.

40:28.661 --> 40:30.495
Greg! Don't.
Relax.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.965
Don't grab my mouth.
Relax. Relax. Relax.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.667
You're silencing me.
Oh, my god.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.467
Get the fuck off.
Okay, stop.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.137
Alice: Don't grab me
like that again.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.004
And she came at me with a knife.

40:39.038 --> 40:41.006
Jordan: I'm sorry...
Alice: Back off.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.141
Okay, buck!

40:43.676 --> 40:44.743
Wait, where's Emma?

40:44.777 --> 40:45.811
Oh, my god.

41:00.793 --> 41:01.994
Jordan: Emma?

41:05.030 --> 41:06.565
Emma?

41:06.598 --> 41:07.933
Guys,

41:07.967 --> 41:09.768
maybe Emma could have done it.

41:09.802 --> 41:10.912
She was really pissed at David.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.013
Sophie: Alice, what the fuck?

41:12.037 --> 41:13.081
Sophie: Emma wouldn't do that.

41:13.105 --> 41:14.006
She was devastated.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.041
She's having, like,
a full-on panic attack.

41:16.075 --> 41:17.676
Yeah, but she's an actress.

41:17.710 --> 41:19.611
She's acting.
Remember <i>hedda gabler?</i>

41:19.645 --> 41:20.579
Okay, not to be mean,

41:20.612 --> 41:22.614
but she wasn't that good
in <i>hedda gabler.</i>

41:39.832 --> 41:41.166
This is my room.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.568
So open it.

41:43.669 --> 41:44.670
You open it.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.772
What happened to,
"Greg would never do this?"

41:46.805 --> 41:48.741
He wouldn't.
Okay, so open it.

41:48.774 --> 41:50.175
I will in one second.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.077
I'm going to.

42:02.721 --> 42:03.989
Sophie: He's not here.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.627
Soph, are there any guns
in the house?

42:08.660 --> 42:09.695
Guns?

42:10.262 --> 42:11.397
No. No way.

42:11.430 --> 42:13.832
David's dad can be a dick,
but his politics check out.

42:26.812 --> 42:27.946
Jordan: Guys...

42:33.385 --> 42:35.087
What the fuck is this?

42:38.390 --> 42:40.259
Uh... but...

42:40.292 --> 42:43.629
He wanted to be prepared
for the hurricane. He...

42:47.132 --> 42:48.309
Sophie: Why did he circle
the fucking house

42:48.333 --> 42:49.768
on his fucking map?

42:49.802 --> 42:51.522
Jordan: We have to
find Emma before he does.

42:51.703 --> 42:52.805
Sophie: Okay.

42:56.909 --> 42:58.243
Jordan: Let's check
my room next.

43:32.444 --> 43:34.179
Jordan: I don't think
he's hiding in my bra.

43:36.915 --> 43:38.083
Alice: Guys...

43:38.117 --> 43:39.318
Come here.

43:54.166 --> 43:56.235
Oh, my god, Emma.

43:58.270 --> 43:59.671
Emma.

43:59.705 --> 44:00.873
Are you okay?

44:00.906 --> 44:02.717
Emma: What's going on?
What are you guys doing?

44:02.741 --> 44:04.042
You scared me what's happening?

44:05.177 --> 44:06.345
It's so hot in here.

44:08.447 --> 44:09.381
What is that?

44:09.414 --> 44:11.350
Xanax. Do you want one?
Yeah, give me one.

44:12.417 --> 44:14.920
You want one?
Sophie: No.

44:14.953 --> 44:16.321
Jordan: Hey, you take this.

44:16.355 --> 44:18.857
Why?
Jordan: I'm gonna find Greg.

44:18.891 --> 44:21.260
Greg, why? Where's Max?

44:21.293 --> 44:23.996
Maybe Max did it.
Maybe he is here.

44:24.029 --> 44:25.297
Max was really angry at David.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.374
I'm serious,
he looked like he was gonna

44:26.398 --> 44:27.299
do something really fucked up.

44:27.332 --> 44:28.967
Jordan: Alice! Shut up.
I'm just saying.

44:29.001 --> 44:30.269
Max would never.

44:30.302 --> 44:31.970
Let's go find Greg.

44:32.371 --> 44:33.372
Okay.

44:55.827 --> 44:56.929
Jordan: What the...

44:59.031 --> 45:01.200
What the fuck?
Alice: Oh, my god.

45:03.101 --> 45:05.037
Sophie: What the hell
is on his face?

45:05.070 --> 45:07.873
It's his light therapy mask.
He has seasonal depression.

45:10.008 --> 45:11.109
Jordan: Let's go.

45:24.423 --> 45:25.791
Hey... shh...

45:39.471 --> 45:40.806
Alice: Greg.

45:48.013 --> 45:50.148
What's up?
Jordan: Where have you been?

45:50.182 --> 45:51.350
Huh?

45:51.383 --> 45:52.451
Where have you been?

45:53.285 --> 45:55.287
Oh, I, uh...

45:55.320 --> 45:56.455
I couldn't sleep,

45:56.488 --> 45:59.024
so I came down here
to do my exercises.

45:59.057 --> 46:00.297
Alice: Why didn't
you answer me?

46:00.325 --> 46:01.493
Were you calling for me?

46:01.527 --> 46:02.894
Alice: Yeah.

46:02.928 --> 46:04.930
I... I had my headphones in.

46:08.601 --> 46:11.870
Are you guys
still playing werewolf?

46:16.408 --> 46:17.943
Alice: Greg!

46:17.976 --> 46:19.378
Stop! Stop it!

46:24.550 --> 46:25.585
All right.

46:25.618 --> 46:27.419
What am I supposed to do, huh?

46:27.452 --> 46:28.987
Why don't you tell us,
fucking Greg?

46:29.021 --> 46:31.256
Greg: Is that my go bag?
Is that a knife?

46:31.290 --> 46:32.592
Why did you bring a go bag?

46:32.625 --> 46:34.960
The hurricane?
See, I told you.

46:34.993 --> 46:36.170
Sophie: Why did you circle
the fucking house

46:36.194 --> 46:37.262
on your fucking map?

46:39.031 --> 46:40.566
What's going on?
David is dead.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.134
His body is outside.

46:42.167 --> 46:43.468
David's body. Wait, what?

46:43.503 --> 46:44.970
Why did you kill David?

46:45.003 --> 46:46.606
You murdered my boyfriend.

46:46.639 --> 46:50.442
No, no. David killed me.
Right?

46:50.475 --> 46:52.277
Jordan: This isn't
a joke, Greg.

46:52.311 --> 46:54.614
David is dead.
Somebody slit his throat.

46:54.647 --> 46:56.448
What?
Sophie: With a fucking sword,

46:56.481 --> 46:58.116
you fucking sick fuck!

47:01.621 --> 47:03.488
Oh...

47:05.223 --> 47:06.858
You guys are fucking with me?

47:10.095 --> 47:12.364
Oh, you guys
are fucking with me.

47:14.466 --> 47:15.467
Fuck!

47:16.401 --> 47:17.869
Cute.

47:17.903 --> 47:19.304
No!

47:20.238 --> 47:22.107
Okay.

47:22.140 --> 47:23.580
Everyone needs
to take a deep breath.

47:24.376 --> 47:25.410
Alice.

47:25.444 --> 47:26.522
Sophie: Give me my knife back!

47:26.546 --> 47:28.380
What the fuck is going on?

47:28.413 --> 47:30.550
I don't know!

47:30.583 --> 47:32.451
Put down the weapons.
Jordan: You put it down.

47:32.484 --> 47:33.919
Now!

47:34.520 --> 47:35.621
On the floor!

47:37.356 --> 47:38.567
Jordan: Okay, okay.
How about this?

47:38.591 --> 47:39.934
Put it down.
Jordan: Okay, okay, okay.

47:39.958 --> 47:41.226
Okay, we'll put them down.

47:41.259 --> 47:42.538
We'll put... we'll all
put them down.

47:42.562 --> 47:44.482
Right? We'll put them down
if you put yours down.

47:45.297 --> 47:46.365
We'll put them down.

47:47.567 --> 47:49.669
Okay.

47:49.702 --> 47:51.604
Okay.
Yeah, please, please.

47:51.637 --> 47:53.205
That seems fair.
Alice: Yeah.

47:54.139 --> 47:55.173
Okay.

47:55.207 --> 47:56.308
Putting it down.

47:57.577 --> 47:59.177
We're good.
Yeah.

47:59.211 --> 48:00.946
Okay, this is good.

48:01.614 --> 48:03.048
All right.

48:06.451 --> 48:08.420
Jordan!
Are you okay?

48:08.453 --> 48:10.021
Ow!
Alice: Stop! Stop!

48:10.956 --> 48:12.357
Please stop!
Greg: Alice?

48:14.594 --> 48:15.994
Alice: Stop. Stop!

48:16.027 --> 48:17.229
No! No!

48:25.605 --> 48:27.939
Sophie! No.
No, no, no, Sophie!

48:58.069 --> 48:59.938
Greg: Mother fucker.

49:10.550 --> 49:12.083
Oh, my god.

49:13.285 --> 49:15.287
Oh, my god.

49:39.177 --> 49:40.445
Alice: This isn't right.

49:42.314 --> 49:44.149
He didn't do it.

49:44.182 --> 49:47.118
Alice, how do you know?
How do you that know he did?

49:48.253 --> 49:49.488
Look, I mean, like...

49:50.590 --> 49:52.324
If you look at all of us, like,

49:53.291 --> 49:55.060
on paper, logically,

49:55.093 --> 49:57.563
he is the most likely
to commit an act of violence.

49:57.597 --> 49:59.130
On paper?

50:00.432 --> 50:03.268
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

50:03.301 --> 50:04.135
I mean, he's the only one

50:04.169 --> 50:06.137
who served in the military,
right? So...

50:07.272 --> 50:08.340
What?

50:09.775 --> 50:11.677
Jordan: He's a vet.

50:11.711 --> 50:13.411
Right? Like Iraq? Or...

50:13.445 --> 50:15.146
Emma: No, I thought
it was Afghanistan.

50:15.180 --> 50:17.717
He was a veterinarian.

50:17.750 --> 50:19.519
He was
a veterinarian's assistant.

50:19.552 --> 50:21.621
Are you fucking
serious right now?

50:21.654 --> 50:23.823
Emma: Then why did
you call him g.I. Joe?

50:23.856 --> 50:26.692
Because... have you seen him?

50:26.726 --> 50:28.694
Well, regardless, either way,

50:28.728 --> 50:32.665
like, out of all of us,
he is the biggest unknown.

50:32.698 --> 50:34.199
We've known each other forever.

50:34.232 --> 50:36.636
Alice: Jordan, what are
you trying to do?

50:36.669 --> 50:38.547
Jordan: I'm not...
I'm not trying to do anything.

50:38.571 --> 50:40.773
Alice: He's dead, okay?

50:40.806 --> 50:42.675
He's dead. We killed him.

50:42.708 --> 50:44.175
She killed him.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.321
Go change your shirt.

51:01.527 --> 51:04.697
Emma: We need to leave.
We need to get out of here.

51:04.730 --> 51:06.097
We don't have a car.

51:06.131 --> 51:07.833
Okay, I'm going to walk.
Emma, stop.

51:07.867 --> 51:08.977
What do you mean?
You can't just fucking...

51:09.001 --> 51:11.303
Jordan: Emma, you're literally
in the middle of nowhere.

51:11.336 --> 51:12.738
Where are you going?

51:24.850 --> 51:27.118
Alice: I mean, it could
have been any of us.

51:27.152 --> 51:29.387
We all scattered
when the lights went out.

51:29.421 --> 51:32.390
I mean, it could
have been Max, okay?

51:32.424 --> 51:34.459
Alice, you don't know
what you are talking about.

51:34.492 --> 51:37.128
He punched David
in the face
because of you.

51:37.162 --> 51:38.864
Just because Max
is in love with me

51:38.898 --> 51:40.533
doesn't mean
he would kill David.

51:41.701 --> 51:43.435
Oh, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

51:43.936 --> 51:45.170
Emma: What?

51:45.203 --> 51:48.306
This is not about you and Max.

51:48.340 --> 51:49.809
Why are you being so mean?

51:49.842 --> 51:51.677
Because I'm upset, Emma.

51:51.711 --> 51:53.813
I'm upset because somebody
killed my best friend.

51:53.846 --> 51:56.348
Sophie, did you use?
I can believe you're making

51:56.381 --> 51:58.350
this about you.

51:58.383 --> 52:01.854
I'm sad, too, okay?
I'm scared, too.

52:01.887 --> 52:04.189
I loved him so much.

52:04.222 --> 52:05.691
It didn't seem like it.

52:05.725 --> 52:07.492
What?
Sophie: It seemed like

52:07.526 --> 52:08.761
you loved having a boyfriend.

52:08.794 --> 52:10.261
And you loved
feeling comfortable.

52:10.295 --> 52:12.464
But, no, you did not love him.

52:12.497 --> 52:14.165
You didn't even
fucking like him.

52:14.199 --> 52:15.744
You were just too scared
to do anything about it.

52:15.768 --> 52:17.946
So you stayed for three years
longer than you should have

52:17.970 --> 52:19.371
because you're a coward.

52:19.805 --> 52:21.239
No, I'm not.

52:21.907 --> 52:23.609
No, I'm not.

52:24.710 --> 52:25.845
I'm not.

52:26.512 --> 52:27.913
I'm not. Right? I...

52:28.914 --> 52:30.683
You're... you're so toxic.

52:30.716 --> 52:31.884
Emma, calm down.
You are.

52:31.917 --> 52:33.318
No! No, I'm not gonna...

52:33.351 --> 52:34.887
You are so toxic.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.657
And, honestly, when you fell
off the face of the earth,

52:37.690 --> 52:39.692
David was relieved.

52:39.725 --> 52:43.428
He was relieved he didn't
have to deal with you anymore.

52:43.461 --> 52:45.239
I wish they had chopped off
your head instead,

52:45.263 --> 52:46.464
you spineless piece of shit.

52:46.899 --> 52:48.333
Sophie.

52:48.366 --> 52:49.602
Alice: Jesus fucking Christ.

52:51.537 --> 52:52.738
Emma.

52:52.772 --> 52:54.640
Emma, come on. Wait.

52:54.674 --> 52:56.474
Wait.
Alice: Emma.

52:56.509 --> 52:57.610
Emma.

52:58.010 --> 52:59.310
Emma.

53:00.278 --> 53:01.747
Jordan: That was
real nice, soph.

53:02.948 --> 53:04.382
Guys...

53:05.718 --> 53:06.852
Where the fuck is bee?

54:35.541 --> 54:36.709
Sophie: Emma.

54:38.077 --> 54:39.377
I'm so sorry.

54:39.410 --> 54:40.780
I'm so sorry.

54:40.813 --> 54:42.047
I'm really sorry.

54:42.081 --> 54:44.349
I'm so fucked up right now.

54:45.584 --> 54:46.652
I'm sorry.

54:47.418 --> 54:48.888
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54:48.921 --> 54:50.841
Okay? It was just, like,
things started coming...

54:56.461 --> 54:58.697
Isn't that what you wanted?

55:00.465 --> 55:01.710
Yeah, Emma,
that's what I wanted.

55:01.734 --> 55:02.811
That's what I was
in the mood for.

55:02.835 --> 55:04.804
Thank you very much.
What the fuck?

55:04.837 --> 55:06.471
Jesus Christ!

55:06.505 --> 55:07.849
You always think everyone
is in love with you.

55:07.873 --> 55:09.041
It's so crazy.
I...

55:10.075 --> 55:11.644
I'm sorry.

55:11.677 --> 55:12.745
I'm sorry.

55:12.778 --> 55:13.846
Do you want this?

55:15.948 --> 55:16.982
Yeah.

55:17.016 --> 55:18.349
Thank you.

55:18.383 --> 55:19.484
Sure.

55:33.065 --> 55:34.365
Alice: Bee?

55:43.408 --> 55:44.442
Soph?

56:08.167 --> 56:09.467
Jordan: Emma?

57:19.538 --> 57:20.606
Help!

57:20.940 --> 57:21.941
Jordan!

57:22.675 --> 57:23.542
Help!

57:23.575 --> 57:25.544
Help.
Jordan: Where are you?

57:25.577 --> 57:27.046
Help! Please, help! Help!

57:27.079 --> 57:29.982
Help! Help! Help!

57:31.617 --> 57:32.718
Emma.

57:32.751 --> 57:33.895
Jordan: Oh, my god.
Alice: Emma.

57:33.919 --> 57:36.121
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

57:36.155 --> 57:37.823
What happened?
I don't know!

57:37.856 --> 57:39.058
I don't know.

57:41.694 --> 57:43.729
Don't touch her!
I'm just trying to...

57:43.762 --> 57:45.173
Don't. No!
Figure out what happened.

57:45.197 --> 57:46.808
Jordan: How am I supposed
to know if I don't touch her?

57:46.832 --> 57:48.499
Alice: Don't, just don't,
just don't.

57:49.001 --> 57:50.836
Oh, fuck.

57:50.869 --> 57:51.937
Oh, my god.

57:53.772 --> 57:55.774
Alice: I heard something.

57:55.808 --> 57:58.577
Um, maybe she...

57:58.610 --> 58:00.546
Oh, my god.

58:00.579 --> 58:02.548
She fell, maybe she tripped?
Alice: No.

58:02.581 --> 58:04.750
No, no. She...

58:04.783 --> 58:06.919
She... she got pushed, okay?

58:06.952 --> 58:09.521
She was pushed.
I told you it wasn't Greg!

58:09.555 --> 58:11.123
Jordan: Are you happy
that she's dead?

58:11.156 --> 58:13.726
No, but I told you
it wasn't Greg!

58:22.001 --> 58:23.836
I did... I did tell you.

58:30.209 --> 58:31.910
Alice: Don't you see
what's happening?

58:34.346 --> 58:35.948
What?

58:35.981 --> 58:37.149
Who was the killer?

58:37.182 --> 58:38.217
What?

58:40.119 --> 58:41.120
Who was the killer?

58:41.754 --> 58:42.755
In the game?

58:43.789 --> 58:45.824
It's following the same pattern.

58:45.858 --> 58:46.859
The deaths.

58:46.892 --> 58:48.627
Please... please,
just stop talking, please!

58:48.660 --> 58:50.796
David, Greg, Emma.

58:50.829 --> 58:52.331
David, Greg, Emma.

58:52.364 --> 58:53.799
Jordan: No.
Yes!

58:53.832 --> 58:55.072
Fucking yes, Jordan!
Jordan: No.

58:55.100 --> 58:57.669
No, it's not
following the same pattern.

58:57.703 --> 59:00.873
Greg died and then
we executed David.

59:00.906 --> 59:03.275
But in real life,
David died and then we...

59:03.308 --> 59:08.247
Okay, but Greg, David, Emma.
Greg, David, Emma.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.958
I mean, why else would
somebody leave her there

59:09.982 --> 59:11.259
unless they wanted us
to find her?

59:11.283 --> 59:12.818
Why would they want us
to find her?

59:12.851 --> 59:15.854
Because they're playing
a sick fucking game.

59:16.221 --> 59:17.790
Okay?

59:17.823 --> 59:19.758
Who was the killer?
I wasn't the killer.

59:19.792 --> 59:20.759
Alice, you're fucking coked out.

59:20.793 --> 59:23.162
You're coked out, okay?
We're all coked out.

59:23.195 --> 59:24.763
I'm not.

59:24.797 --> 59:25.998
I'm not.

59:26.965 --> 59:28.100
Are you wearing make up?

59:30.803 --> 59:32.304
I... I was upstairs,
changing my...

59:32.337 --> 59:33.872
Alice: You look weird.

59:34.840 --> 59:36.241
Whose sweater is this?

59:36.275 --> 59:37.609
I found it upstairs.

59:38.877 --> 59:39.921
How long have you known her?

59:39.945 --> 59:41.180
Stop, Alice.

59:43.115 --> 59:44.116
Who are you?

59:45.350 --> 59:47.319
What?
You show up here,

59:47.352 --> 59:49.354
start smiling at my boyfriend.

59:51.223 --> 59:52.724
What are you talking about?

59:52.758 --> 59:53.826
Your voice is trembling.

59:53.859 --> 59:55.761
No. No.
Yeah. It is.

59:55.794 --> 59:56.929
Jordan: I googled you.

59:56.962 --> 59:58.630
And there was nobody
with your name

59:58.664 --> 01:00:01.767
who graduated
from Utah state this year.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.670
There's literally no record
of your attendance, at all.

01:00:04.703 --> 01:00:05.771
What the fuck?

01:00:06.405 --> 01:00:08.173
Listen, I can explain.

01:00:08.207 --> 01:00:09.675
Alice: Oh, my god.

01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:11.210
You discovered David's body.

01:00:11.243 --> 01:00:12.420
No, I just...
You could have tampered

01:00:12.444 --> 01:00:13.345
with the generator,

01:00:13.378 --> 01:00:14.856
just like you tampered
with Sophie's car.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.814
You said you
left the lights on, right?

01:00:15.848 --> 01:00:18.016
Are you serious?
We watched you kill someone.

01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:20.119
You literally murdered Greg!

01:00:20.152 --> 01:00:21.386
Literally!

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.255
Literally! You sick fuck!

01:00:23.288 --> 01:00:25.357
No, are you crazy? No.
Calm down.

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:27.726
Let's just talk about it.
Talk about it?

01:00:27.759 --> 01:00:29.161
Bee: Yeah.
No... no.

01:00:29.194 --> 01:00:30.863
Bee: Let's just talk
about it, okay?

01:00:30.896 --> 01:00:32.030
Mmm-mmm. I don't want to.

01:00:32.064 --> 01:00:33.799
Bee: Sophie... Sophie.
Alice: No!

01:00:33.832 --> 01:00:35.276
Bee: Sophie.
Ali, ce: Do not touch her!

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.035
Whoa!

01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:38.179
Alice: You know what?
I don't...

01:00:38.203 --> 01:00:39.238
I don't want you in here.

01:00:39.271 --> 01:00:40.339
Okay, calm down.

01:00:40.372 --> 01:00:41.406
No, seriously.
Alice!

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.680
Alice!
I don't want you in here.

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:44.676
Bee: I... relax.
Just shut up! Shut up!

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.011
I don't want you in here.

01:00:46.044 --> 01:00:47.355
Get out of this room!
Let go of me, Alice.

01:00:47.379 --> 01:00:48.456
Get the fuck out of this room!

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.125
I don't want to look
at your face anymore. Get out.

01:00:50.149 --> 01:00:51.226
Bee: Alice, calm down.
Alice: I'm not...

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.727
Alice: I'm not calming down.
Bee: Let go of me, Alice.

01:00:52.751 --> 01:00:54.820
No, you killed
my fucking boyfriend.

01:00:54.853 --> 01:00:56.397
You know what? You know what?
It was self-defense.

01:00:56.421 --> 01:00:57.465
Alice: I... I want her out.

01:00:57.489 --> 01:00:58.991
Jordan, can you help me?
All right.

01:00:59.024 --> 01:01:00.392
Jordan!
Jesus, Alice.

01:01:00.425 --> 01:01:01.827
Get the fucking door!

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.328
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:01:03.362 --> 01:01:04.830
I do not want her in here!

01:01:04.863 --> 01:01:05.964
Bee: Relax!
Alice: No!

01:01:05.998 --> 01:01:07.900
Bee: Relax!
Alice: No!

01:01:07.933 --> 01:01:10.068
Sophie! Sophie, do something!

01:01:10.102 --> 01:01:11.770
You killed him, get out!

01:01:11.803 --> 01:01:13.172
Sophie!
Alice: Get out!

01:01:17.409 --> 01:01:19.311
Sophie!

01:03:41.353 --> 01:03:42.588
Jordan: Stay here.

01:05:23.723 --> 01:05:25.090
Alice: I'm so hungry.

01:05:25.123 --> 01:05:26.167
Jordan: How can you
be hungry right now?

01:05:26.191 --> 01:05:27.335
Alice: I wasn't
planning on this.

01:05:27.359 --> 01:05:29.194
Jordan: Alice...

01:05:29.227 --> 01:05:31.564
What the fuck?
How the fuck you get in here?

01:05:31.597 --> 01:05:33.198
She has a gun.

01:05:33.231 --> 01:05:35.967
Jordan has a gun
in her pocket, Sophie,

01:05:36.001 --> 01:05:37.202
get away from her.

01:05:37.235 --> 01:05:38.413
No, no, Sophie,
she's confusing...

01:05:38.437 --> 01:05:39.505
Let go of me.

01:05:39.539 --> 01:05:41.173
Are you kidding me?

01:05:41.206 --> 01:05:42.508
I don't have a gun.

01:05:42.542 --> 01:05:44.409
Bee: Then empty your pockets.

01:05:46.546 --> 01:05:47.547
Slowly!

01:05:57.523 --> 01:05:58.990
That's it?

01:05:59.024 --> 01:06:00.225
That's it.

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.962
Oh, my god.

01:06:05.263 --> 01:06:06.364
You are the killer.

01:06:08.634 --> 01:06:10.469
In the... in the game... I...

01:06:10.503 --> 01:06:12.037
How the fuck
did you get in here?

01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.682
Where is the gun?
I don't have a fucking gun.

01:06:13.706 --> 01:06:16.642
We locked all the doors.
How did you get in?

01:06:16.676 --> 01:06:17.710
You killed him.

01:06:17.743 --> 01:06:20.278
Why would I kill David?
Why would I kill David?

01:06:20.312 --> 01:06:21.179
Why would I kill Emma?

01:06:21.213 --> 01:06:22.113
They are, literally,
my oldest friends.

01:06:22.147 --> 01:06:24.282
You just fucking met them!
How dare you?

01:06:24.316 --> 01:06:25.417
When I found David,

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:28.019
you were the last person
to get there.

01:06:29.087 --> 01:06:31.022
It took you awhile.
That's true.

01:06:31.056 --> 01:06:33.458
Bee: Where were you
when Emma died, hmm?

01:06:33.492 --> 01:06:35.093
You pushed her!
Shut up!

01:06:35.126 --> 01:06:36.471
Guy's, don't listen to her.
You don't know what the fuck

01:06:36.495 --> 01:06:38.196
you're talking about!
And then, I saw you.

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:39.565
I saw you getting the gun.

01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:40.666
Jordan: That's a lie.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.034
That's a fucking lie.
You're lying. You're a liar!

01:06:43.068 --> 01:06:44.737
You're lying through
your fucking teeth.

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:45.605
You lied about everything.

01:06:45.638 --> 01:06:47.172
You lied about
everything to Sophie.

01:06:47.205 --> 01:06:48.774
You're a fucking liar.

01:06:48.808 --> 01:06:51.076
Yeah, you...
You did lie to Sophie.

01:06:55.681 --> 01:06:56.749
Okay.

01:06:59.084 --> 01:07:00.118
Okay.

01:07:04.322 --> 01:07:06.224
I did go to Utah state

01:07:06.692 --> 01:07:08.661
for one semester.

01:07:08.694 --> 01:07:12.732
But my mom was...
She was having a hard time

01:07:12.765 --> 01:07:14.499
and I came home
to take care of her.

01:07:17.302 --> 01:07:18.738
And I did work at gamehut,

01:07:20.405 --> 01:07:22.440
but they shut down
our location, like,

01:07:22.474 --> 01:07:24.744
a week after I met you. I...
I've been applying, but...

01:07:24.777 --> 01:07:26.111
What were you doing
when I dropped

01:07:26.144 --> 01:07:27.279
you off at the mall?

01:07:31.817 --> 01:07:34.386
Hung out at
the food court. I...

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:39.457
Didn't want to disappoint you.

01:07:44.396 --> 01:07:45.565
I was embarrassed.

01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:51.771
I should have told you.
I just...

01:07:53.839 --> 01:07:55.575
My mom, she...

01:07:57.643 --> 01:07:58.811
She has...

01:08:01.413 --> 01:08:03.148
My mom has borderline.

01:08:03.816 --> 01:08:05.383
Alice: Oh, my god.

01:08:06.484 --> 01:08:08.554
I'm so sorry, that's...

01:08:08.588 --> 01:08:09.855
That's really serious.

01:08:09.889 --> 01:08:12.758
Mental health
is a really serious issue.

01:08:12.792 --> 01:08:15.628
I mean, I've never actually
said this to anyone, but...

01:08:18.496 --> 01:08:19.575
But I have body dysmorphia.

01:08:19.599 --> 01:08:21.600
Oh, my god.
Shut the fuck up, Alice.

01:08:23.935 --> 01:08:25.805
I wanted to tell you.
I just...

01:08:29.441 --> 01:08:31.777
I just really wanted
you to like me.

01:08:41.654 --> 01:08:44.389
You've got to
be fucking kidding me.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.694
Oh, my god.

01:08:48.728 --> 01:08:49.629
Jordan, what the fuck?

01:08:49.662 --> 01:08:50.939
Are you telling me
that you believe that

01:08:50.962 --> 01:08:51.831
pile of bullshit?

01:08:51.863 --> 01:08:53.566
Is that supposed
to inspire confidence?

01:08:53.599 --> 01:08:55.300
Her mom has "borderline."

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:57.803
Is that not a red fucking flag
to anybody else?

01:08:57.837 --> 01:08:58.938
That's a serious issue.

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:00.404
Where the fuck did you get that?

01:09:00.438 --> 01:09:01.473
David's dad's rich!

01:09:01.506 --> 01:09:02.439
Rich people
have fucking guns, Sophie!

01:09:02.474 --> 01:09:04.242
My parents are rich.
They don't have guns.

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:05.745
Well, I mean, we're all rich,

01:09:05.778 --> 01:09:07.912
but you and David
are like rich, rich.

01:09:07.947 --> 01:09:09.881
That has never mattered to me...

01:09:09.915 --> 01:09:11.617
Oh, shut the fuck up!

01:09:11.651 --> 01:09:13.519
We didn't even
want to invite you.

01:09:13.551 --> 01:09:14.854
We debated about inviting you,

01:09:14.886 --> 01:09:16.589
but because it's David's house.

01:09:16.622 --> 01:09:17.890
I didn't say that, but...

01:09:17.923 --> 01:09:19.825
And, no, you did not
respond in the group chat.

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:22.493
And then, you show up
with this fucking psychopath.

01:09:22.528 --> 01:09:24.663
Don't call her a psychopath,
that's so ableist.

01:09:24.697 --> 01:09:26.296
Fuck you.
You deserve each other.

01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:28.299
I hope she fucking suffocates
you in your sleep.

01:09:28.332 --> 01:09:31.301
Alice: Yeah, you didn't
reply in the chat.

01:09:31.336 --> 01:09:33.939
And David actually told me

01:09:33.973 --> 01:09:37.643
that you, like, begged him
to talk to your parents

01:09:37.676 --> 01:09:40.444
and, like,
unlock your trust again.

01:09:40.478 --> 01:09:41.857
And that's why
you're actually here.

01:09:41.881 --> 01:09:43.214
Oh, yeah?

01:09:43.247 --> 01:09:44.325
Oh, yeah, did he tell you that

01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:45.727
while you guys were railing
lines in front of me.

01:09:45.751 --> 01:09:46.585
Your addict friend

01:09:46.618 --> 01:09:48.720
who you're supposedly
so worried about?

01:09:48.754 --> 01:09:50.255
We are worried.
Sophie: No!

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:51.667
No, no, no.
Let me get this straight.

01:09:51.691 --> 01:09:52.801
Okay, let me get this straight.

01:09:52.825 --> 01:09:54.259
So, when the black girl

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:55.828
has a coke habit,
it's a problem.

01:09:55.861 --> 01:09:57.530
But when everyone else
around her does it,

01:09:57.563 --> 01:09:59.598
including her best friend,
who happens to be white

01:10:00.032 --> 01:10:01.299
and male,

01:10:01.332 --> 01:10:02.568
it's fine?

01:10:02.601 --> 01:10:05.638
I understand and I'm an ally,

01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:09.642
and I totally get how it...

01:10:11.443 --> 01:10:12.578
Looks that way.

01:10:13.646 --> 01:10:14.714
And...

01:10:15.781 --> 01:10:16.882
Um...

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:19.685
Jordan?
Oh, my god.

01:10:19.719 --> 01:10:22.253
You are obsessed
with playing the victim.

01:10:22.287 --> 01:10:23.189
Sophie: Excuse me?

01:10:23.221 --> 01:10:24.857
I had to ride
in the ambulance with you

01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.892
three times,
thinking you were dead.

01:10:26.926 --> 01:10:28.761
I needed help and I got it

01:10:28.794 --> 01:10:29.929
and I'm sorry.
You got help?

01:10:29.962 --> 01:10:33.398
You mean we
had to narc on you
to your fucking dad

01:10:33.431 --> 01:10:35.801
so he'd cut you off
and ship you off to rehab,

01:10:35.835 --> 01:10:39.270
while you were quite
literally kicking
and screaming.

01:10:39.304 --> 01:10:40.539
Yeah.
And then you just

01:10:40.573 --> 01:10:42.007
fell off the face of the earth.

01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:43.151
'Cause that's what you do, soph.

01:10:43.175 --> 01:10:44.920
That's what you do
when things get tough,
you run.

01:10:44.944 --> 01:10:47.345
You ran away to go write
your fucking memoirs.

01:10:47.378 --> 01:10:49.380
It's creative non-fiction
which is a valid response

01:10:49.414 --> 01:10:50.883
to life in an attention economy.

01:10:50.916 --> 01:10:52.551
Oh, fuck off and die.

01:10:52.585 --> 01:10:53.686
You write little essays

01:10:53.719 --> 01:10:55.988
about your mommy and her vodka.

01:10:56.021 --> 01:10:57.489
And your pussy
and your feelings.

01:10:57.523 --> 01:10:58.758
And your fucking feelings.

01:10:58.791 --> 01:11:00.559
Oh, my god, we are all drowning

01:11:00.593 --> 01:11:01.961
in your fucking feelings.

01:11:01.994 --> 01:11:04.997
Feelings are facts.
No! No, they're not.

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:06.297
Facts are facts.

01:11:06.331 --> 01:11:07.700
Why did you ghost us, Sophie?

01:11:07.733 --> 01:11:08.868
Like why?

01:11:09.869 --> 01:11:11.336
Because you fucking trigger me.

01:11:13.404 --> 01:11:14.540
You enable me.

01:11:15.975 --> 01:11:17.009
Does she know?

01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:18.443
Sophie: Does she know what?

01:11:19.078 --> 01:11:21.479
That you begged me

01:11:21.514 --> 01:11:23.949
to stop at your apartment
on my way up here.

01:11:23.983 --> 01:11:25.316
And I did.

01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:27.586
And we fucked in your car.

01:11:28.721 --> 01:11:29.588
She's fucking lying.

01:11:29.622 --> 01:11:30.899
She's lying through
her fucking teeth.

01:11:30.923 --> 01:11:31.967
She's trying to get
in your head.

01:11:31.991 --> 01:11:33.692
Don't listen to her, okay?

01:11:33.726 --> 01:11:34.827
Check her texts.

01:11:37.495 --> 01:11:39.532
You are unhinged, Jordan.

01:11:40.866 --> 01:11:43.669
You are devoid of empathy.

01:11:43.702 --> 01:11:45.004
You have no feelings.

01:11:45.037 --> 01:11:46.806
Do you want to know
why I could never

01:11:46.839 --> 01:11:48.306
ever be with you?

01:11:49.374 --> 01:11:50.475
Because you schedule

01:11:50.509 --> 01:11:52.511
everything in your
fucking Google calendar,

01:11:52.545 --> 01:11:53.746
including sex.

01:11:53.779 --> 01:11:55.881
Because you have no soul.

01:11:55.915 --> 01:11:56.982
Jordan: Fuck you.

01:11:57.016 --> 01:11:58.884
You're emotionally abusive.

01:11:58.918 --> 01:12:00.418
I had to go to therapy for PTSD.

01:12:00.451 --> 01:12:02.353
You can fucking ask Alice.

01:12:02.387 --> 01:12:04.089
Yeah, she did.

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:06.091
For a long time.

01:12:11.496 --> 01:12:13.364
You hate Alice.

01:12:13.398 --> 01:12:15.034
No, I don't.
Yeah, you despise her.

01:12:15.067 --> 01:12:16.545
You complain constantly
about how vapid

01:12:16.569 --> 01:12:17.937
and annoying she is.
You hate her.

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:19.805
It's pitiful how
you won't stop making fun

01:12:19.839 --> 01:12:21.907
of her stupid little podcast.

01:12:21.941 --> 01:12:23.474
Let her have the podcast.

01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.377
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:26.411 --> 01:12:29.648
You hate listen to her podcast.

01:12:29.682 --> 01:12:30.683
Wait...

01:12:31.083 --> 01:12:32.383
What?

01:12:33.451 --> 01:12:34.954
And you made us
swear on our lives

01:12:34.987 --> 01:12:36.088
not to tell anyone.

01:12:36.856 --> 01:12:38.023
Jordan, is that true?

01:12:39.424 --> 01:12:41.527
I like your podcast, Alice.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.429
What is your podcast about?

01:12:44.462 --> 01:12:46.464
Hanging out with
your smartest
and funniest friend.

01:12:46.497 --> 01:12:49.969
Did you just groan?

01:12:50.002 --> 01:12:51.036
No.

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:52.004
When I said "hanging out

01:12:52.037 --> 01:12:54.006
"with your smartest
and funniest friend."

01:12:54.039 --> 01:12:56.508
Oh, my god.
Like that. Like that!

01:12:56.542 --> 01:12:57.710
Fuck!
You just did it again.

01:12:57.743 --> 01:12:59.044
No, I didn't!
First of all,

01:12:59.078 --> 01:13:01.747
a podcast takes
a lot of work, okay?

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.082
You have to organize the guests.

01:13:03.115 --> 01:13:04.884
You have to do a Google calendar

01:13:04.917 --> 01:13:07.119
and you build a following.

01:13:07.152 --> 01:13:08.888
It takes a long fucking time!

01:13:08.921 --> 01:13:10.723
And I've been working
on it for a while!

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:12.758
Okay?

01:13:12.791 --> 01:13:14.760
And then, let me say,

01:13:14.793 --> 01:13:17.763
that nobody likes you, okay?

01:13:17.796 --> 01:13:21.066
Nobody likes you!
Nobody likes you!

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.811
Do you know
when you're drunk
and you cry to me,

01:13:22.835 --> 01:13:24.503
"oh, I'm afraid nobody likes me

01:13:24.536 --> 01:13:26.147
"because I'm mean
and a bitch and I suck."

01:13:26.171 --> 01:13:29.541
Well, you do, okay?
You fucking suck.

01:13:29.575 --> 01:13:31.710
And I only hang out
with you out of pity

01:13:31.744 --> 01:13:34.580
and the suffocating weight
of our shared history.

01:13:34.613 --> 01:13:36.849
And that is all.

01:13:36.882 --> 01:13:39.484
And you're just so in love

01:13:39.518 --> 01:13:41.654
with your rags
to riches narrative,

01:13:41.687 --> 01:13:43.589
like you're the only
fucking person in the world

01:13:43.622 --> 01:13:45.157
who didn't come from money.

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:47.159
You know what?

01:13:47.192 --> 01:13:51.196
Your parents
are upper middle class.

01:13:52.698 --> 01:13:53.799
No, they're not.

01:13:54.199 --> 01:13:55.433
Jordan.

01:13:56.168 --> 01:13:58.003
They are.

01:13:58.037 --> 01:14:00.105
They teach at a university.

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.509
It's public.

01:14:03.542 --> 01:14:05.644
Oh, my god.

01:14:05.678 --> 01:14:08.647
Oh, my god, I mean,
no wonder Sophie od'd.

01:14:08.681 --> 01:14:10.149
Who could date
a fucking spreadsheet

01:14:10.182 --> 01:14:11.583
with a superiority complex?

01:14:11.617 --> 01:14:13.097
It's, like, you're such a...

01:14:13.919 --> 01:14:15.988
Ow!

01:14:16.922 --> 01:14:18.657
What the fuck?

01:14:18.691 --> 01:14:19.992
Sophie: What the fuck, Jordan?

01:14:20.025 --> 01:14:23.028
Alice: Oh, my god.
Are you serious?

01:14:23.062 --> 01:14:24.697
Did you just fucking shoot me?

01:14:26.832 --> 01:14:29.168
No.
Alice: You fucking shot me.

01:14:29.201 --> 01:14:30.936
With a gun!

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:31.937
Jordan: No,
I didn't shoot you. I...

01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:34.139
Alice: You fucking
murdered them, you freak!

01:14:34.173 --> 01:14:36.608
You're the murderer.
I knew it!

01:14:36.642 --> 01:14:38.177
I knew it, you're such a bitch!

01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:39.144
You're such a fucking bitch!

01:14:39.178 --> 01:14:41.146
I didn't murder anybody.
Alice: Yes, you did.

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.748
Jordan, put the gun down.

01:14:42.781 --> 01:14:44.783
Alice: I've never
been shot before.

01:14:44.817 --> 01:14:47.853
It really fucking hurts!

01:14:47.886 --> 01:14:49.588
Sophie: Put the fucking
gun down, please.

01:14:49.621 --> 01:14:51.590
You did this.
You made me do this.

01:14:51.623 --> 01:14:52.858
Why did you make me do that?

01:14:52.891 --> 01:14:53.969
What are you doing?
Put the gun down.

01:14:53.993 --> 01:14:56.128
Why? Why did you shoot me?

01:14:56.161 --> 01:14:57.129
Jordan: I did not shoot you.

01:14:57.162 --> 01:14:59.031
Yes, you did! With that gun!
Stop, stop, stop.

01:14:59.064 --> 01:15:00.699
Alice, stop. Stop!
With that gun.

01:15:00.733 --> 01:15:02.668
Stop waving it around.
I'm not waving.

01:15:02.701 --> 01:15:04.036
Don't hit me.
You already shot me.

01:15:04.069 --> 01:15:05.871
Stop! Don't touch me.

01:15:05.904 --> 01:15:07.248
Sophie: No, no, no!
Alice: Get the gun!

01:15:07.272 --> 01:15:09.074
Sophie: No!
Alice: Sophie, the gun!

01:15:09.108 --> 01:15:10.642
Don't! Stop!
You're on my leg!

01:15:10.676 --> 01:15:11.810
You're on my leg!

01:15:12.578 --> 01:15:13.946
I want it. Give it to me!

01:15:13.979 --> 01:15:16.148
Jordan: No!
Sophie: Let go!

01:15:20.652 --> 01:15:21.754
Jordan: No!

01:15:21.787 --> 01:15:23.122
Sophie: Ow!

01:15:23.155 --> 01:15:24.623
Alice: No!

01:15:24.656 --> 01:15:25.557
No!
Alice: Give it to me.

01:15:25.591 --> 01:15:26.935
Give me it! Give me it!
Get off of me! No!

01:15:26.959 --> 01:15:28.069
Jordan: Get the fuck off me!

01:15:28.093 --> 01:15:29.294
Get off!

01:15:31.897 --> 01:15:33.866
Ow! My fucking leg!

01:15:33.899 --> 01:15:35.567
Sophie: Where is it?

01:15:35.601 --> 01:15:37.169
Alice: Ow!

01:16:18.644 --> 01:16:19.845
I didn't do it.

01:16:31.957 --> 01:16:33.258
Please, don't move.

01:16:33.292 --> 01:16:34.660
Don't you fucking move.

01:16:34.693 --> 01:16:36.061
It's okay...
It's okay, Jordan.

01:16:36.095 --> 01:16:37.930
Please, don't do it.

01:16:37.963 --> 01:16:39.398
Please, just...

01:16:39.431 --> 01:16:42.935
Stop! I didn't do it.
Please, just stop, okay?

01:16:42.968 --> 01:16:44.736
Just put it down.
Please, stop moving.

01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.272
Please... please,
don't follow me, please.

01:16:47.306 --> 01:16:50.175
Please...
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:51.743
Stop, stop, stop!

01:16:51.777 --> 01:16:53.045
Sophie: Why are we doing this?

01:16:53.078 --> 01:16:54.413
Jordan: Don't come up here.

01:16:54.446 --> 01:16:55.681
Don't, please, don't.

01:16:55.714 --> 01:16:56.791
Sophie: Please put it down.

01:16:56.815 --> 01:16:58.750
Jordan: Please stop.
Please stay there.

01:16:58.784 --> 01:16:59.818
Oh, my god.

01:16:59.852 --> 01:17:01.053
Sophie: Please...

01:17:03.322 --> 01:17:05.190
Jordan: Stop.
Sophie: I'm begging you...

01:17:05.224 --> 01:17:07.392
Don't fucking come up here.
Please.

01:17:07.426 --> 01:17:09.928
Sophie, I'm serious,
just stay there.

01:17:11.096 --> 01:17:12.164
Sophie: Stop.

01:17:12.197 --> 01:17:14.066
Just stay there.
Just please stay there.

01:17:14.099 --> 01:17:15.000
I'm begging you.

01:17:15.033 --> 01:17:19.138
Please, fucking...
Fucking stay there! Fuck!

01:17:38.223 --> 01:17:39.224
Sophie: Bee!

01:18:13.258 --> 01:18:16.962
Check her texts.

01:19:06.144 --> 01:19:07.446
Sophie.

01:19:12.484 --> 01:19:13.952
Did you kill Emma?

01:19:14.253 --> 01:19:15.287
No.

01:19:18.824 --> 01:19:19.992
Did you?

01:19:20.359 --> 01:19:21.460
No.

01:19:23.929 --> 01:19:26.965
It's okay, if you did it.
It's okay.

01:19:28.601 --> 01:19:31.303
I just want to know.
You can tell me.

01:19:31.336 --> 01:19:33.805
Did you kill David?
What?

01:19:33.839 --> 01:19:35.107
No.

01:19:35.508 --> 01:19:36.808
You killed Greg.

01:19:36.842 --> 01:19:38.544
To protect you.

01:19:38.578 --> 01:19:40.078
I had to.

01:19:59.031 --> 01:20:00.432
Will you answer this honestly?

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.802
Okay, I promise. What is it?

01:20:04.303 --> 01:20:05.470
Did you...

01:20:06.204 --> 01:20:07.306
With Jordan?

01:20:08.073 --> 01:20:09.207
No.

01:20:09.474 --> 01:20:10.876
No.

01:20:12.177 --> 01:20:15.213
No, I didn't...
I didn't. I would never.

01:20:17.617 --> 01:20:18.984
I love you, okay?

01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:27.025
Do you love me?

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.135
I just wanted to touch you.

01:20:38.203 --> 01:20:39.237
You frighten me.

01:20:47.446 --> 01:20:48.548
Sophie: Bee!

01:20:53.018 --> 01:20:54.219
Bee!

01:20:56.355 --> 01:20:58.123
We have to stay together!

01:20:59.124 --> 01:21:00.892
Bee!

01:21:05.931 --> 01:21:06.998
Bee!

01:21:14.106 --> 01:21:15.140
Bee?

01:21:18.443 --> 01:21:19.612
Bee?

01:21:21.681 --> 01:21:23.181
Where are you?

01:21:26.418 --> 01:21:27.653
I love you.

01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:33.392
We have to stay together.

01:21:39.231 --> 01:21:40.465
Bee!

01:21:46.405 --> 01:21:47.973
- Okay.
- Bee!

01:23:52.097 --> 01:23:53.231
Hey, hey.

01:23:55.433 --> 01:23:58.203
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.474
I have to tell you something.

01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:06.779
I went to Alice's room and I...

01:24:06.812 --> 01:24:09.515
And then I found coke
and then...

01:24:09.549 --> 01:24:13.251
I... I said all these things
to Emma and she...

01:24:13.285 --> 01:24:15.320
I... I gave her pills
'cause...

01:24:16.354 --> 01:24:18.156
And then she tripped and fell.

01:24:20.526 --> 01:24:21.661
It's my fault.

01:24:22.828 --> 01:24:25.665
Sophie, it's okay. It's okay.

01:24:27.867 --> 01:24:29.735
Sophie: I thought no one
would believe me.

01:24:36.842 --> 01:24:38.143
Give me your phone.

01:24:40.345 --> 01:24:41.379
What?

01:24:41.413 --> 01:24:43.516
I want to see
your text with Jordan.

01:24:44.650 --> 01:24:46.351
No.

01:24:46.384 --> 01:24:47.620
I have to see your texts.

01:24:50.322 --> 01:24:51.356
Please?

01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:19.518
Sophie: No.
Sophie.

01:25:19.552 --> 01:25:20.786
Sophie: Stop!

01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:04.897
That's not my phone.

01:26:04.930 --> 01:26:06.431
Oh... what?

01:26:11.904 --> 01:26:13.338
That's not my phone.
