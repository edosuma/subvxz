WEBVTT

00:10.478 --> 00:11.745
( dials )

00:14.482 --> 00:16.650
HEY, PAUL, IT'S 7:08
AND I'M DOWNSTAIRS.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.120
SO IF YOU'RE SLEEPING,
WAKE UP.

00:45.079 --> 00:48.849
MIA, SORRY.
I GOT DETAINED.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.218
WHERE WERE YOU?
I'M FREEZING.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.621
MY APOLOGIES.
COME ON UP.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.504
( theme music playing )

01:44.104 --> 01:45.839
YOU GO BACK TO MARYLAND
ON THE WEEKENDS?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.142
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.879
WHAT HAPPENED?
AMTRAK BROKE DOWN?

01:51.979 --> 01:57.385
ARE YOU UPSET THAT
I KEPT YOU WAITING?

01:57.485 --> 02:00.154
I'M STOOD UP EVEN
BY THE MAN THAT I PAY.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.960
IF YOU TOOK THE TRAIN,
IT MUST'VE LEFT AROUND
3:00 IN THE MORNING.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.095
THAT'S UNUSUAL.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.298
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
I KNOW.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.133
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS
OUR FIRST REAL SESSION.

02:13.234 --> 02:17.137
AND I'M ALREADY OUT
12 MINUTES.

02:17.238 --> 02:20.508
WE CAN ADD IT ON
AT THE END IF YOU LIKE.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.876
NO, I CAN'T.
I HAVE A MEETING
WITH A NEW CLIENT,

02:22.976 --> 02:25.045
A PLASTIC SURGEON.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.980
LUCKY YOU DON'T
NEED LIPO.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.350
YOU GO TO ONE
OF MY GUYS,

02:29.450 --> 02:32.920
YOU COULD END UP DEAD
WITH NICE THIGHS.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.223
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.791
I WORKED ALL WEEKEND,
WHICH WAS FINE

02:37.891 --> 02:39.927
BECAUSE THIS WAS
THE WEEKEND THAT
BENNETT AND I

02:40.027 --> 02:42.162
WERE SUPPOSED TO
GO AWAY TOGETHER.

02:42.263 --> 02:46.400
AND, NO, HE DIDN'T CALL
SAYING HE WANTS ME BACK.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.272
MAYBE THIS IS
A MISTAKE.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.441
I MEAN, IF I'M GONNA
BE KEPT WAITING
AT 7:00 A.M.--

02:53.541 --> 02:54.908
DO YOU FEEL
LIKE I WASN'T--

02:55.008 --> 02:57.945
ON TIME?

02:58.045 --> 02:59.613
I HOPE
IT WAS WORTH IT.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.416
WERE YOU
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.485
IS THAT
WHAT YOU IMAGINE?

03:04.585 --> 03:09.257
DO YOU DEFLECT EVERYTHING
THAT'S PERSONAL?

03:09.357 --> 03:12.025
NEVER MIND.
I ALREADY KNOW.

03:12.125 --> 03:15.663
MY BEING LATE SEEMS
TO HAVE BROUGHT UP
QUITE A FEW FEELINGS--

03:15.763 --> 03:18.666
SO THIS IS MORE OF A HOME
REALLY THAN AN OFFICE.

03:18.766 --> 03:23.604
I THINK YOU SAID LAST WEEK
THAT YOU FOUND IT HOMEY.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.107
HOMEY, BUT COLD.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.643
YOU MUST
TURN THE HEAT DOWN

03:29.743 --> 03:32.480
WHEN YOU GO AWAY.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.359
IS THIS HOW YOUR
MARYLAND OFFICE LOOKED?

03:45.459 --> 03:49.530
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL
OF THOSE PATIENTS?

03:49.630 --> 03:52.666
I MEAN, I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALEX,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.968
BUT ALL THE OTHERS--
YOU TOLD THEM

03:55.068 --> 03:57.004
THEIR FEELINGS
WERE IMPORTANT,

03:57.104 --> 03:58.672
AND THEN YOU JUST
LEFT THEM?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.207
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED

04:00.308 --> 04:03.377
THAT I MIGHT
LEAVE AGAIN, MIA?

04:03.477 --> 04:07.615
WINTER EQUALS
HELL FOR HAIR.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.152
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.854
I DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.156
WHY NOT?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.258
I DON'T LIKE
BROWNSTONES--

04:18.359 --> 04:21.862
TOO MUCH BROWN.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.799
AND THIS HAS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE LAST WEEK'S SESSION.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.902
BECAUSE I HAD NOT
EVEN HAD A CHANCE
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.038
ACTUALLY, I HAVE,

04:31.138 --> 04:33.541
AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT

04:33.641 --> 04:36.276
WHAT YOU SAID AT THE DOOR
JUST BEFORE YOU LEFT.

04:36.377 --> 04:40.314
WHEN I SAID,
"YOU OWE ME A CHILD"?

04:40.414 --> 04:42.249
THAT WAS A JOKE.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.584
MAYBE IT WAS.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.486
BUT I GET THE FEELING
THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

04:45.586 --> 04:47.921
A LITTLE MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.360
NO NO, THERE WASN'T.
IT WAS JUST A COMMENT.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.228
SOMETIMES A COMMENT IS
JUST A COMMENT, RIGHT?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.465
HI, HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO SEE YOU.

04:57.565 --> 05:01.435
YOU OWE ME A CHILD.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.638
AREN'T YOU GLAD
I'M BACK?

05:09.843 --> 05:11.712
WHO'S LAURA?

05:14.214 --> 05:15.983
LAURA?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.818
YEAH.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.753
WHO IS SHE?

05:19.853 --> 05:23.391
I'M NOT SURE
WHO YOU'RE REFERRING TO.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.526
IT'S NOT
A HARD QUESTION.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.728
I'M ASKING YOU
ABOUT LAURA HILL.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.263
SHE'S AN EX-PATIENT
OF YOURS.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.100
IF SHE'S A PATIENT
OF MINE,

05:33.200 --> 05:34.968
THEN YOU KNOW
I CAN'T DISCUSS HER.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.304
BUT I CAN.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.273
WHERE IS THIS
COMING FROM?

05:40.374 --> 05:42.275
AN ENVELOPE WAS DELIVERED
TO MY OFFICE.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.811
HENRY MUST'VE MADE
A MISTAKE

05:43.911 --> 05:45.913
AND THOUGHT THAT I WAS
STILL YOUR LAWYER.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.248
AND I OPENED IT.
AND IT WAS HER DEPOSITION

05:48.348 --> 05:51.719
REGARDING ALEX'S
STATE OF MIND.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.422
AND YOU READ IT?

05:54.522 --> 05:57.491
ARE YOU CURIOUS
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID?

05:57.591 --> 06:00.327
I HOPE THAT YOU GAVE
THOSE PAPERS TO MY LAWYER.

06:00.428 --> 06:03.664
IT'S OBVIOUS SHE WAS
IN LOVE WITH YOU,

06:03.764 --> 06:05.666
OR IS.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.501
HOW SO?

06:07.601 --> 06:10.571
IT'S IN AND BETWEEN
HER WORDS.

06:10.671 --> 06:15.075
SHE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
SEALED IT WITH A KISS.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.210
AND WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

06:17.310 --> 06:20.047
OH, YOU ARE CURIOUS.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.451
WELL...
( chuckles )

06:23.551 --> 06:25.953
SHE DESCRIBES HOW SHE
DUMPED HER FIANCE

06:26.053 --> 06:28.456
FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE THE WEDDING--
THAT'S A NICE STORY--

06:28.556 --> 06:31.459
AND HOW SHE SLEPT
WITH ALEX.

06:31.559 --> 06:35.195
AND THAT TELLS YOU THAT
SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.830
SHE DID IT
TO MAKE YOU JEALOUS.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.732
IT DOESN'T TAKE FREUD
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.701
SHE WANTED TO WALK
INTO HER SESSION

06:40.801 --> 06:44.472
AND TELL YOU
THAT SHE WAS FUCKING
A FUCKING WAR HERO.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.774
AND WHAT ELSE
DID SHE SAY?

06:46.874 --> 06:49.610
SHE SAID THAT YOU TWO
BECAME FRIENDS

06:49.710 --> 06:53.313
AFTER THE THERAPY ENDED,

06:53.413 --> 06:55.683
THAT YOU CALLED HER
ON THE PHONE.

06:55.783 --> 06:59.753
YOU BROKE THE RULES
FOR HER.

07:01.622 --> 07:05.759
HOW MANY OTHER PATIENTS
HAVE YOU DONE THAT WITH?

07:05.859 --> 07:09.463
MIA, WHATEVER HAPPENED-
WHATEVER YOU IMAGINE HAPPENED--

07:09.563 --> 07:13.033
I THINK YOU HAD
AN AFFAIR WITH HER.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.973
YOU'RE NOT GONNA RESPOND?

07:21.509 --> 07:24.678
I MUST'VE HIT A NERVE.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.349
SO WHAT,
YOU BROKE HER HEART?

07:29.449 --> 07:32.686
SHE BROKE YOURS.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.455
OH, SHE DOES SUPPORT
YOUR CASE, THOUGH.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.025
YEAH, SHE SAYS THAT YOU
DID NOT MISTREAT ALEX,

07:38.125 --> 07:40.494
SHE MISTREATED YOU
BY SLEEPING WITH HIM.
COME ON.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.497
LET'S LOOK AT YOUR
ACTIONS HERE, MIA.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.634
OH, SHE SAYS SHE WANTS
YOU TO KNOW, THOUGH,
YOU'RE IN HER THOUGHTS.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.703
YOU OPENED A LEGAL DOCUMENT
THAT WAS NOT MEANT FOR YOU.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.639
POINT TAKEN.
I CROSSED A BOUNDARY.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.440
MORE THAN THAT,
YOU KNOWINGLY VIOLATED

07:53.541 --> 07:55.142
A BASIC TENET
OF YOUR PROFESSION.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.310
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.513
AND YOU BROUGHT IT
INTO SESSION.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.815
PAUL, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY THERAPISTS

08:01.915 --> 08:04.918
ARE SUCCESSFULLY SUED
FOR SLEEPING WITH
THEIR PATIENTS?

08:05.018 --> 08:07.621
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY, MIA?

08:09.056 --> 08:11.925
HOW COULD YOU?

08:13.861 --> 08:17.631
WAS SHE THAT YOUNG
AND PRETTY?

08:17.731 --> 08:22.135
OR DID SHE MAKE YOU FEEL
THAT BIG AND IMPORTANT?

08:22.235 --> 08:24.905
TAKE IT.
IT'S YOURS.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.511
DO YOU WANT ME
TO PICK THAT UP
OFF THE FLOOR?

08:31.612 --> 08:33.747
IT'S ALL YOURS.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.192
( chuckles )

08:49.496 --> 08:52.199
I'VE JUST MADE AN ASS
OF MYSELF, HAVEN'T I?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.802
I BET YOU'RE ANGRY.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.542
MAYBE I AM.

09:02.643 --> 09:07.414
MOSTLY, I'M SURPRISED.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.850
NO, YOU'RE FURIOUS.
I CAN SEE IT ALL OVER
YOUR FACE.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.719
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T
EXPRESS IT

09:11.819 --> 09:14.487
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.690
YOU WANT ME TO GO?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.391
WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

09:18.491 --> 09:21.394
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN STOP.
STOP, 'CAUSE I'M LEAVING.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.430
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT YOU'RE PUSHING ME

09:23.530 --> 09:25.532
SO THAT YOU CAN END
THIS TREATMENT.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.100
NO, I DON'T BLAME YOU.
AND IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.236
ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.071
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WAITED FOR ME

09:31.171 --> 09:35.375
IN THE COLD,
ALTHOUGH I WAS LATE.
YOU WAITED FOR ME.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.544
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU'RE GOADING ME

09:37.645 --> 09:39.546
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER
TO FEEL ANGRY WITH ME

09:39.647 --> 09:42.683
THAN LOOK
AT YOUR OWN PAIN?

10:28.095 --> 10:31.398
I SAW THIS SHOW ON THE T.V.
THE OTHER NIGHT-- B.B.C.--

10:31.498 --> 10:35.302
ABOUT MEN AND THEIR

10:35.402 --> 10:38.238
SPECIALLY-MADE
SEX DOLLS.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.474
THE MEN PICK OUT THE EYES,
AND THE MOUTH AND THE BODY.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.510
AND THEY
BUY THEM CLOTHES.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.378
AND THEN THEY PUT
LIPSTICK ON THEM

10:45.478 --> 10:48.315
AND TAKE THEM OUT
FOR PICNICS AND BIKE RIDES.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.250
AND THEY LOVE
THEIR GIRLS

10:50.350 --> 10:54.722
BECAUSE THEY
DON'T TALK

10:54.822 --> 10:57.157
AND THEY NEVER
GET PREGNANT

10:57.257 --> 11:00.227
AND THEY DON'T
GET MAD.

11:03.530 --> 11:07.200
AND THEY HAVE
THREE PERFECT HOLES

11:07.300 --> 11:09.569
THAT CAN BE
REPAIRED--

11:09.669 --> 11:12.672
YOUNG AND PRETTY
FOREVER.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.809
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING THIS?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.778
I WAS THINKING ABOUT

11:17.878 --> 11:21.048
A RECEPTIONIST
IN MY OFFICE

11:21.148 --> 11:23.917
NAMED STEFANIE

11:24.017 --> 11:28.388
WHO LIKES TO WEAR
A LOT OF PINK.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.423
AND SHE'S SO CUTE
AND FRIENDLY.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.292
ALL SHE DOES IS
SHOP ONLINE,

11:32.392 --> 11:33.794
BUT NOBODY WANTS
TO FIRE HER

11:33.894 --> 11:37.931
BECAUSE SHE'S JUST
TOO ADORABLE, YOU KNOW?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.133
AND...
( chuckles )

11:40.233 --> 11:43.737
SHE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED
THAT SHE'S QUITTING

11:43.837 --> 11:45.638
BECAUSE SOME IDIOT
PROPOSED.

11:45.739 --> 11:49.777
SO NOW I HAVE TO GO
TO HER ENGAGEMENT PARTY

11:49.877 --> 11:52.512
AND HER BRIDAL SHOWER
AND HER BACHELORETTE PARTY

11:52.612 --> 11:55.082
AND HER WEDDING.
AND IT'S ENDLESS TORTURE.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.818
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
THERE BEFORE.

11:57.918 --> 12:02.089
THREE YOUNGER SISTERS
AND DOZENS OF COLLEAGUES.

12:10.663 --> 12:14.434
WHEN MEN LOOK
AT A WOMAN LIKE STEFANIE,

12:14.534 --> 12:16.636
THEY JUST SEE
THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.739
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

12:19.840 --> 12:23.010
EASY AND FUN

12:23.110 --> 12:26.046
AND, YOU KNOW,
WILD IN BED AT NIGHT

12:26.146 --> 12:28.581
AND MUFFINS FROM SCRATCH
IN THE MORNING.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.985
AND WHAT DO THEY SEE
WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOU,
DO YOU THINK?

12:35.889 --> 12:38.926
BLONDE LAWYER,

12:39.026 --> 12:40.693
MIGHT BE FUN
TO FUCK, BUT--

12:40.794 --> 12:42.996
BUT WHAT?

12:46.333 --> 12:50.303
BUT THAT'S IT.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.206
WHAT I USUALLY GET--

12:53.306 --> 12:57.544
WHAT I USUALLY GOT
FROM MEN IS SEX.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.385
WHAT DID YOU GET
FROM LAURA?

13:07.020 --> 13:10.824
DO YOU THINK THAT I CHOSE
HER OVER YOU?

13:10.924 --> 13:14.061
WELL, YOU HAD SEX
WITH HER.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.564
WOULD THAT
MAKE YOU JEALOUS?

13:19.399 --> 13:24.071
WELL, I DID HAVE FEELINGS
FOR YOU, PAUL.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.306
EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO,

13:26.406 --> 13:28.141
YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.978
AND IT SURE FELT LIKE
YOU HAD FEELINGS FOR ME.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.114
IT'S SUCH A CLICHE,
ISN'T IT--

13:34.214 --> 13:37.918
A YOUNG WOMAN FALLS
FOR HER THERAPIST?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.854
BUT IF YOU WERE GONNA GET
INVOLVED WITH A PATIENT--

13:40.954 --> 13:43.123
YOU WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
PICK YOU.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.859
YOU DIDN'T.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.961
YOU PICKED HER.

13:48.061 --> 13:52.265
YOU AND LAURA
FUCKING YOUR BRAINS OUT--

13:52.365 --> 13:54.734
WHAT, ON THIS COUCH?

13:54.834 --> 13:58.638
THAT MAKES ME SICK.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.773
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.476
DON'T MAKE ME
TALK ABOUT IT.

14:03.576 --> 14:07.314
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DID
KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT?

14:07.414 --> 14:11.351
I BET YOU WANTED HER
FROM DAY ONE.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.520
YOU WERE SMITTEN.

14:13.620 --> 14:17.357
HOW DID YOU MANAGE
TO WALK HER TO THE DOOR?

14:17.457 --> 14:21.128
YOU ASSUME THAT I FOUND HER
IRRESISTIBLE.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.530
SHE KNEW
HOW TO GET TO YOU.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.966
HOW?

14:28.401 --> 14:30.670
ACT HELPLESS

14:30.770 --> 14:33.540
AND GIRLISH.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.978
SHE PROBABLY HAD
SLIM HIPS...

14:40.213 --> 14:43.150
SMELLED LIKE
CANDY APPLES,

14:43.250 --> 14:45.552
WORE PINK
OR SOMETHING.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.188
OBVIOUSLY,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:48.288 --> 14:52.725
GO ON.
WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE?

14:52.825 --> 14:55.462
SHE'D STARE AT YOU
ALL GOOGOO-EYED,

14:55.562 --> 14:59.899
IMPRESSED BY YOUR
BRILLIANT INTERPRETATIONS,

15:00.000 --> 15:05.438
MADE YOU FEEL LIKE
THE WORLD'S BEST SHRINK.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.009
AND THEN ONE DAY
HER FIANCE GOT MAD

15:09.109 --> 15:10.810
AND SHE FELL APART

15:10.910 --> 15:12.980
AND SOBBED.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.649
AND YOU FELT SORRY
FOR HER,

15:19.752 --> 15:23.556
SO YOU SAT
NEXT TO HER.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.161
GO ON.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.033
AND YOU TOUCHED HER--

15:33.133 --> 15:36.203
HER CHEEK, HER TEARS.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.605
AND YOU REALIZED
HOW YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL

15:38.705 --> 15:40.807
AND VULNERABLE SHE WAS.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.677
AND YOU THOUGHT,
"THIS IS MY MOMENT."

15:44.777 --> 15:50.217
AND YOU KISSED HER
AND THERE WAS NO
TURNING BACK.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.586
WHY NOT?

15:53.686 --> 15:56.656
YOU HAD TO HAVE HER,

15:56.756 --> 15:58.825
UNWRAP HER.

15:58.925 --> 16:02.429
TAKE HER.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.433
AND YOU HAD TO FEEL
HER PERFECT SKIN

16:06.533 --> 16:10.170
AND HER ROUND ASS
AND HER FLAT STOMACH.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.909
IT MUST'VE BEEN
AMAZING FOR YOU--

16:17.010 --> 16:19.979
SO FORBIDDEN.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.317
AND FOR HER?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.920
SHE PROBABLY
DIDN'T FEEL A THING.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.956
SHE'S MADE
OUT OF SILICONE.

16:30.057 --> 16:34.094
RIGHT, THE SEX DOLL.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.229
IT WASN'T ABOUT THE SEX
FOR HER.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.798
IT WAS ABOUT WINNING.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.168
WHAT DID SHE WIN?

16:41.268 --> 16:45.072
YOU.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.179
FOR THOSE MINUTES
YOU WERE HERS.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.052
NOW DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO?

17:02.255 --> 17:04.791
I'D RATHER KNOW WHAT
YOU THINK HAPPENED NEXT.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.959
I DON'T KNOW.

17:07.060 --> 17:11.698
MAYBE YOU HELD HER
GENTLY

17:11.798 --> 17:15.302
UNTIL SHE FELL ASLEEP.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.604
AND SHE WOULD LIKE THAT?

17:21.541 --> 17:25.145
THAT'S WHAT WOULD MAKE HER
FEEL GOOD?

17:27.847 --> 17:30.083
THAT'S WHAT
SHE REALLY WANTS?

17:32.819 --> 17:35.388
YES.

17:36.489 --> 17:40.293
IT'S GOOD TO FEEL
THAT CLOSENESS.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.635
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT FROM ME.

17:48.735 --> 17:53.273
YOU MEAN, TO FALL ASLEEP
WHILE YOU HOLD ME?

17:53.373 --> 17:58.345
TO BE COMFORTED,
CONTAINED.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.082
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.752
WHY NOT?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.055
OH, COME ON, PAUL,
JUST ADMIT

18:09.156 --> 18:11.758
THAT I'M DIFFICULT.

18:11.858 --> 18:17.029
I PUSH MEN AWAY.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.432
LOOK AT BENNETT
AND ANDRE--

18:19.532 --> 18:21.168
I MEAN, PICK ANY LETTER
IN THE ALPHABET--

18:21.268 --> 18:23.436
I'VE SENT THEM PACKING.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.105
I'M LIKE A KNIFE
IN YOUR NECK.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.941
IT FEELS GOOD
WHEN IT'S GONE.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.443
RIGHT?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.745
SO YOU THINK I'D BE RELIEVED
IF YOU LEFT?

18:32.845 --> 18:34.481
SURE.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.550
I WALK OUT THAT DOOR--
YOU FEEL RELIEF.

18:37.650 --> 18:41.388
YOU WANT TO PRETEND
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.491
ACTUALLY, I ALREADY
TOLD YOU,

18:44.591 --> 18:49.296
I DID THINK ABOUT
OUR LAST SESSION

18:49.396 --> 18:52.432
AND THE ONES
FROM 20 YEARS AGO.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.634
YOU KNOW,
IT'S OKAY, PAUL.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.271
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FAKE IT WITH ME.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.373
YOU KICKED ME OUT OF HERE
20 YEARS AGO

19:00.473 --> 19:02.709
AND YOU NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT ME AGAIN.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.215
IT'S OKAY.

19:31.771 --> 19:35.475
( Chopin's "Raindrop Prelude"
playing )

20:12.479 --> 20:14.547
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?

20:14.647 --> 20:17.684
THAT'S YOU PLAYING,
ISN'T IT?

20:18.351 --> 20:21.388
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.424
YOU KEPT THAT
ALL THESE YEARS?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.660
HMM.

20:29.195 --> 20:32.299
CHOPIN'S
"RAINDROP PRELUDE."

20:32.399 --> 20:35.635
GOD, I LOVE THIS PIECE,

20:35.735 --> 20:39.806
HOW THE EIGHTH NOTES
SOUND LIKE RAIN.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.810
THAT'S FROM A RECITAL.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.813
MY TEACHER, MR. CAMPBELL,
PUT THAT TOGETHER.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.451
HE SAID THAT
I WAS THE BEST,

20:51.551 --> 20:54.220
BUT NOT TO TELL
THE OTHERS.

20:54.321 --> 20:58.791
SO YOU TWO HAD A SECRET.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.194
WHAT AGE WERE YOU THEN?

21:02.295 --> 21:06.499
I MUST'VE BEEN 10.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.168
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE
MY FAREWELL PERFORMANCE.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.972
THAT'S A SHAME.
YOU PLAY REALLY BEAUTIFULLY.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.977
A FEW WEEKS
AFTER THAT RECITAL

21:18.077 --> 21:20.179
I WAS SENT TO LIVE

21:20.279 --> 21:23.450
AT MY AUNT'S
IN NEW JERSEY.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.151
I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU TELLING ME

21:25.251 --> 21:26.619
YOU WERE SENT AWAY
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.388
IT WAS ONLY
ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.123
BUT WHEN I CAME BACK,
THE PIANO WAS GONE

21:31.223 --> 21:35.328
AND TWIN GIRLS
WERE THERE.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.498
DO YOU REMEMBER

21:38.598 --> 21:40.533
ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT THE SEPARATION?

21:40.633 --> 21:44.337
MY DAD CAME TO VISIT ME
EVERY SUNDAY.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.305
HE'D BRING
MY FAVORITE CANDIES.

21:46.406 --> 21:51.611
I LIKED THOSE COLORED DOTS
THAT WERE STUCK TO PAPER

21:51.711 --> 21:55.515
AND THOSE BOTTLES FILLED
WITH THAT SUGARY LIQUID.

21:55.615 --> 21:59.018
AND HE WOULD SHOW ME
PICTURES OF THE TWINS.

21:59.118 --> 22:03.356
AND I WOULD TELL HIM

22:03.456 --> 22:07.126
THAT I MISSED THEM ALL
AND WANTED TO COME HOME.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.562
BUT HE DIDN'T TAKE YOU.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.533
WHERE WAS YOUR MOTHER?

22:13.633 --> 22:16.836
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN,

22:16.936 --> 22:20.373
I'M SURE SHE CAME,
MAYBE AT CHRISTMAS.

22:20.473 --> 22:23.042
WHAT ABOUT
THE REST OF THE TIME?

22:23.142 --> 22:24.677
I WENT TO SCHOOL.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.879
IT SURE WAS DIFFERENT
FROM GREENPOINT, THOUGH.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.949
GOSH, IT WAS SO CLEAN...
( chuckles )

22:30.049 --> 22:31.518
AND MODERN.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.821
AND ALL THE TEXTBOOKS
WERE NEW.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.589
I DIDN'T REALLY
LIKE THE KIDS, THOUGH.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.190
I THOUGHT
THEY WERE BORING.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.460
SOUNDS LONELY.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.463
MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU
GAVE ME THAT CASSETTE--

22:43.563 --> 22:45.865
BECAUSE I'D KNOW
HOW YOU FELT

22:45.965 --> 22:49.436
WHEN YOU WERE 10 AND YOUR
PARENTS MADE YOU LEAVE.

22:49.536 --> 22:53.606
MAYBE YOU THOUGHT IF I
LISTENED TO IT BACK THEN,

22:53.706 --> 22:56.676
I WOULD CHANGE MY MIND,
LET YOU STAY.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.878
BUT I WAS DIFFICULT
EVEN THEN.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.380
- YOU THINK YOU DESERVED IT.
- I WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.715
HOW SO?

23:02.815 --> 23:04.651
I FOUGHT WITH MY MOTHER
ALL THE TIME.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.454
- OVER WHAT?
- EVERYTHING.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.756
YOU WERE A DIFFICULT
10-YEAR-OLD WHO LOVED CHOPIN.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.525
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHY WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THIS.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.227
THEY DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG
AND I DON'T BLAME THEM.

23:15.327 --> 23:18.998
EARLIER IN THE SESSION
YOU SAID THAT YOU
DIDN'T BLAME ME.

23:19.098 --> 23:22.669
I CROSSED THE LINE.
I VIOLATED ATTORNEY-CLIENT
PRIVILEGE.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.505
YOU THOUGHT
I WAS KICKING YOU OUT.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.640
WELL, I BET
YOU WANTED TO, RIGHT?

23:27.740 --> 23:31.544
I'M WONDERING, MIA,
IF YOU WERE TESTING
ME TODAY.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.113
YOU REPRIMANDED ME
FOR BEING LATE.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.882
YOU VIOLATED MY PRIVACY.

23:35.982 --> 23:39.251
YOU EVEN WANTED ME
TO PICK UP THE DEPOSITION
OFF THE FLOOR.

23:39.351 --> 23:41.621
WELL, I WAS
PRETTY ANGRY.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.423
MAYBE YOU WERE
TRYING TO SEE

23:44.524 --> 23:47.794
IF I COULD BE
PUSHED AWAY.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.829
SO YOU'RE SAYING

23:49.929 --> 23:52.865
THAT MY PARENTS WERE RIGHT
AND BENNETT WAS RIGHT;

23:52.965 --> 23:55.468
THAT I'M SO FUCKED UP
THAT NOBODY WANTS
TO BE WITH ME

23:55.568 --> 23:57.770
BECAUSE I PUSH
EVERYONE AWAY

23:57.870 --> 24:00.172
AND I'M DEMANDING
AND I'M NEEDY

24:00.272 --> 24:03.643
AND I'M ANGRY
AND I'M WEEPY?

24:03.743 --> 24:05.778
I'M THE SEVEN
FUCKING DWARVES.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.547
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING, MIA.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.983
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
THAT MAYBE YOU ARE ANGRY,

24:11.083 --> 24:13.886
BUT YOU ALSO WANT ME
TO BE CLOSE TO YOU;

24:13.986 --> 24:17.189
AND THAT NO MATTER HOW
DIFFICULT YOU SAY YOU ARE,

24:17.289 --> 24:20.560
THAT BENEATH THE TOUGHNESS
YOU STILL WANT TO BE
CONNECTED TO ME.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.696
BUT YOU'RE ALSO AFRAID.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.799
YOU'RE AFRAID THAT
I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.238
OH.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.213
( intercom buzzes )

24:41.313 --> 24:42.749
OH.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.420
I'D BETTER LEAVE.

24:48.521 --> 24:51.958
THEY'RE EARLY.
IT'S OKAY.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.327
I HAVE A MEETING

24:55.427 --> 24:56.863
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE LATE.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.898
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO KEEP
THE NEXT ONE WAITING.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.167
OKAY.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.270
SO THEN...

25:04.370 --> 25:07.373
I'LL SEE YOU
NEXT MONDAY

25:07.473 --> 25:10.376
SAME TIME?

25:10.476 --> 25:13.212
YOU OWE ME

25:13.312 --> 25:15.682
THE 12 MINUTES.

25:15.782 --> 25:21.153
OKAY, THEN I'LL SEE YOU
AT 6:48.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.623
OKAY.

25:23.723 --> 25:28.227
UM, DID YOU HAVE SEX
WITH LAURA?

25:29.929 --> 25:32.464
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW

25:32.565 --> 25:36.168
WE'RE HAVING WHAT'S CALLED
"A DOORKNOB MOMENT."

25:36.268 --> 25:37.837
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:37.937 --> 25:40.239
THAT'S WHEN RIGHT AT THE END
OF THE SESSION,

25:40.339 --> 25:44.143
A PATIENT SAYS
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.214
IS THAT YOUR ANSWER?
'CAUSE THAT'S A YES.

25:48.314 --> 25:52.719
IS IT?
I MEAN, DID YOU?

25:54.921 --> 25:57.023
NO.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.059
NO.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.168
YOU MIGHT WANT TO WATER
THE PLANT OUTSIDE.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.971
I POURED
MY LATTE ON IT.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.669
( music playing )
