*

00:03.659 --> 00:04.627
(screams)

00:07.297 --> 00:09.299
DE LEÓN:
You experienced
a hemorrhagic event.

00:09.332 --> 00:11.801
One that made the pregnancy
no longer viable.

00:25.448 --> 00:26.816
-Take the baby, Scott!
-Who is that?

00:30.353 --> 00:32.388
(grunting)

00:32.455 --> 00:33.623
(baby crying)

00:33.656 --> 00:34.957
You wanted to see me?

00:34.990 --> 00:36.292
MARCUS:
I'm sending you to Oakland.

00:36.326 --> 00:37.960
EZ:
Oakland got hit last night.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.229
MARCUS:
What about Coco?

00:39.295 --> 00:41.131
HANK:
Fuckers who rolled up

00:41.131 --> 00:42.798
was SOA.

00:42.832 --> 00:45.301
ANGEL:
Somebody should probably
check in on Letty.

00:45.301 --> 00:47.002
-Heard about what happened.
-EZ: Manny?

00:47.036 --> 00:48.571
MARCUS:
Coco was a good soldier.

00:48.638 --> 00:49.972
The Sons will answer
for his death.

00:49.972 --> 00:52.342
But we cannot afford
an all-out war right now.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.644
No, padri we act now.

00:54.644 --> 00:56.912
We all know Packer's
on his last leg at UC Davis.

00:56.979 --> 00:59.649
So we go there,
take out their leadership.

00:59.682 --> 01:02.418
-Me, Angel...
-I'd be honored to join you.

01:02.485 --> 01:04.154
Let's go to war.

01:04.154 --> 01:06.055
Fuck yeah.

01:11.227 --> 01:13.496
("Costumbres" by Rocío Dúrcal

(engine shuts off)

02:11.254 --> 02:12.922
Sir?

02:26.402 --> 02:28.404
It's too dangerous.

02:32.742 --> 02:34.744
MIGUEL:
She may need help.

02:55.097 --> 02:57.099
*

03:14.350 --> 03:16.952
-(grunting)
-Jefe!

03:16.952 --> 03:18.321
Jefe!

03:21.457 --> 03:23.459
Come on. You okay?
Come on.

03:25.361 --> 03:27.363
Get in, get in.
Come on.

03:29.799 --> 03:32.302
-(motorcycle revving)

03:32.335 --> 03:33.303
Go, go, go, go!

03:47.650 --> 03:49.251
MIGUEL:
Who the fuck was that?!

03:49.319 --> 03:51.321
I don't know.

03:52.322 --> 03:54.690
*

04:20.850 --> 04:22.217
Where you want this?

04:23.553 --> 04:25.555
Over there's fine.

04:38.534 --> 04:40.235
EZ:
Haven't seen
one of these in a while.

04:43.439 --> 04:45.541
I feel like you been
wanting to ask.

04:49.879 --> 04:51.714
It's not my place.

04:51.747 --> 04:53.383
But I saw your tattoo.

04:56.285 --> 04:58.488
SOFÍA:
Had a pretty good idea
about you, too.

04:58.554 --> 05:00.756
Way you stand like
you're always posting up.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.892
Like you ain't gonna
let no one get the jump on you.

05:02.892 --> 05:04.894
(sighs)

05:07.563 --> 05:09.565
(clears throat)

05:13.603 --> 05:15.304
Some shit's hard to let go of.

05:27.316 --> 05:29.318
Murder.

05:31.253 --> 05:32.922
A cop.

05:34.990 --> 05:37.026
Shit.

05:37.092 --> 05:39.762
That must've made you popular
with the C.O.'s.

05:39.795 --> 05:42.097
Didn't care much
about their opinion.

05:45.167 --> 05:46.802
Club stuff?

05:46.836 --> 05:48.771
Nah, club came after.

05:48.804 --> 05:50.606
Prison.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.941
The gateway drug.

05:51.941 --> 05:53.443
My brother, actually.

05:53.443 --> 05:54.877
Older or younger?

05:54.944 --> 05:57.279
Physically older, but...

05:58.681 --> 06:00.349
...emotionally, much younger.

06:04.186 --> 06:06.121
He's all right.

06:07.322 --> 06:09.625
Know what's best
about getting out?

06:12.528 --> 06:13.963
Silence.

06:15.364 --> 06:17.633
All the constant
fucking yelling.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.635
Jesus.

06:19.635 --> 06:21.637
All of it.

06:23.205 --> 06:25.207
It's...

06:26.809 --> 06:28.811
Hell.

06:37.219 --> 06:40.155
You'd think you'd revel
in the freedom, getting out,

06:40.155 --> 06:43.593
but being locked up
kills something inside you.

06:43.659 --> 06:45.360
Numbs you.

06:45.394 --> 06:47.497
And I don't know if you ever...

06:47.497 --> 06:49.999
ever fully feel again.

06:50.032 --> 06:52.034
How long?

06:59.742 --> 07:01.744
54 months.

07:04.914 --> 07:06.381
(sighs)

07:06.415 --> 07:08.017
Damn.

07:08.017 --> 07:10.019
I was guilty.

07:11.420 --> 07:14.023
I was the only guilty one
in there.

07:14.023 --> 07:16.458
Everyone else was either
working on an appeal

07:16.526 --> 07:19.228
or swearing they got jammed up.

07:19.261 --> 07:22.264
Every crooked bitch in there
a victim in her own mind.

07:23.566 --> 07:24.900
You didn't fight your case?

07:24.934 --> 07:26.569
No, I told my PD to...

07:26.602 --> 07:28.604
take whatever
they wanted to give me.

07:31.206 --> 07:33.208
I had it coming.

07:37.412 --> 07:38.814
Negligence.

07:38.881 --> 07:41.751
You can imagine
how popular I was.

07:41.784 --> 07:43.786
A crime against my kid.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.556
But they couldn't hurt me.

07:46.556 --> 07:48.558
I was already dead.

07:52.394 --> 07:54.764
(sighs) You know,
you can't blame yourself...

07:54.797 --> 07:57.066
There ain't nothing to fix here.

08:00.469 --> 08:02.504
You want to see me again?

08:02.572 --> 08:04.574
You need to realize
I ain't a project.

08:06.241 --> 08:08.243
This is what it is.

08:09.411 --> 08:11.914
A good lay and hard abs
ain't gonna magically turn me

08:11.914 --> 08:14.416
into a princess.

08:19.254 --> 08:21.991
That's what I love about men.

08:23.826 --> 08:25.695
(sighs)

08:25.761 --> 08:27.697
We think y'all are
a calculus problem,

08:27.763 --> 08:29.765
but you're just basic math.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.937
Two plus two equals
"please tell me my dick's big."

08:34.970 --> 08:37.472
(both laugh)

08:37.506 --> 08:39.274
I feel like now I should
let you know that I minored

08:39.274 --> 08:41.310
in mathematical physics
at Stanford.

08:42.511 --> 08:44.980
(short laugh)
So big.

08:45.014 --> 08:47.016
(both laugh)

09:00.863 --> 09:02.965
I got to take off
for a bit today.

09:02.998 --> 09:04.566
I don't know how long.

09:04.634 --> 09:06.135
Just got to
take care of something.

09:06.168 --> 09:08.170
Think maybe you could
check in on Sally?

09:08.203 --> 09:10.339
Give her a walk?

09:10.372 --> 09:12.374
Ivy League, huh?

09:13.375 --> 09:15.144
But still not smart enough
to realize

09:15.144 --> 09:17.980
I'm just using you
to get to her?

09:18.013 --> 09:20.015
It's crossed my mind.

09:21.684 --> 09:23.819
I'll drop by after work.

09:26.656 --> 09:29.992
And then if I promise
not to try to fix you?

09:33.195 --> 09:34.563
I thought you were going.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.069
Bye, Sofía.

09:48.243 --> 09:50.245
(phone buzzing)

10:00.422 --> 10:02.624
(sighs)

10:02.692 --> 10:04.894
EZ:
Leave a message.

10:04.927 --> 10:06.862
(line beeps)

10:06.862 --> 10:08.563
Hey, bro.

10:08.597 --> 10:10.700
Been trying to holler at you.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.202
Feels like you're dodging me.

10:13.235 --> 10:16.038
-Not a good idea.
-BISHOP: He's running

10:16.071 --> 10:17.740
this fucking charter
into the ground.

10:21.543 --> 10:23.879
Coco... being gone.

10:26.949 --> 10:29.151
This club needs more unity.

10:29.218 --> 10:30.986
Not division.

10:31.053 --> 10:32.722
He's right, Bish.

10:32.755 --> 10:34.556
We need to come together.

10:34.589 --> 10:37.226
* Angel *

10:37.259 --> 10:39.729
* Ain't you an angel... *

10:39.762 --> 10:41.663
Everything I've fucking done
for you.

10:41.731 --> 10:43.598
* Ain't you an angel... *

10:43.632 --> 10:45.935
For you fucking both.

10:45.968 --> 10:48.437
MARCUS:
Any word from EZ or Angel?

10:48.470 --> 10:50.840
HANK:
Yeah. Got a text an hour ago,

10:50.906 --> 10:52.607
saying they're outside Davis.

10:52.641 --> 10:54.009
MARCUS:
You should all go home,
get some rest.

10:54.076 --> 10:55.778
Be some long,
dark days ahead, huh?

10:55.811 --> 10:57.747
* Won't you be mine... *

10:57.780 --> 10:59.248
Primo.

10:59.281 --> 11:00.950
Got a minute?

11:00.983 --> 11:03.285
* Show me what you like *

11:05.587 --> 11:08.590
* Be with an angel *

11:31.480 --> 11:32.948
What?

11:35.017 --> 11:36.718
Izzy's celebrating
her birthday tonight.

11:36.786 --> 11:38.453
She wants you to come over.

11:38.453 --> 11:41.456
* Oh, woman... *

11:41.490 --> 11:43.292
You fucking serious?

11:43.325 --> 11:46.128
Maybe you're not aware what's
going on at the moment, padrino.

11:46.128 --> 11:48.730
I'm very aware.

11:48.798 --> 11:51.400
I'm also aware
that Izzy loves you, carnal.

11:51.466 --> 11:52.968
And specifically
asked for you to come

11:53.002 --> 11:54.336
celebrate with us tonight.

11:55.971 --> 11:59.141
* Won't you be mine? *

12:00.976 --> 12:04.479
* Won't you be mine... *

12:04.479 --> 12:06.348
I'm gonna have to pass.

12:06.381 --> 12:10.252
* Be mine *

12:10.319 --> 12:13.655
* Oh, be mine... *

12:13.655 --> 12:16.325
Whatever issue you got with me,

12:16.358 --> 12:18.493
don't you punish Izzy.

12:18.527 --> 12:20.996
She's been nothing
but good to you.

12:21.030 --> 12:23.866
When you and Antonia were
at your lowest, she was there.

12:23.899 --> 12:26.836
She's a good woman, primo.

12:26.869 --> 12:29.371
And if she wants you
at her dinner,

12:29.404 --> 12:31.706
you're gonna
be at her fucking dinner.

12:36.912 --> 12:38.547
Only three dudes out there.

12:39.915 --> 12:42.684
EZ:
Yeah, but looks like they
got some friends inside.

12:43.919 --> 12:45.387
ANGEL:
So what's the deal?

12:45.420 --> 12:47.622
We go in there
and make right by Coco.

12:47.689 --> 12:50.259
Kill as many high-ranking Sons
as we can find.

12:55.030 --> 12:57.699
Uh, so that's your big idea?

13:02.737 --> 13:05.307
Every time I come up with some
elaborate plan it gets fucked.

13:05.374 --> 13:07.476
So fuck it, here it is.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.979
We walk in,
they don't see us coming,

13:10.045 --> 13:11.480
we find Packer,
Chibs and the rest

13:11.546 --> 13:13.082
and we shoot as many
as we fucking can.

13:13.115 --> 13:14.483
Fuck yeah, it works for me.

13:14.549 --> 13:16.551
Oh, so cool, awesome. Um...

13:16.551 --> 13:17.887
we don't even know
where the fuck they got

13:17.920 --> 13:19.388
Packer at, bro.

13:19.388 --> 13:21.056
BOTH:
Oncology.

13:21.090 --> 13:22.724
What the fuck's oncology?

13:22.757 --> 13:24.759
Cancer ward, bro.

13:25.895 --> 13:28.063
Why-why the fuck you guys
just ain't say that then?

13:30.099 --> 13:32.067
Yo, you got your kutte on
under that?

13:32.067 --> 13:34.069
Yeah.

13:34.103 --> 13:36.571
'Cause if I die today I want
them to know I was a Mayan.

13:44.479 --> 13:45.847
-ANGEL: Thank you.
-You're welcome.

13:45.915 --> 13:47.917
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

13:58.827 --> 14:00.329
Fuck.

14:08.770 --> 14:10.772
Ah...

14:15.677 --> 14:18.047
Hey, hey, hey. Um...

14:18.113 --> 14:20.449
Estoy buscar, uh...

14:21.951 --> 14:23.652
¿Dónde está el, el, el...

14:23.685 --> 14:25.988
departamiento de, uh...

14:26.021 --> 14:27.622
Uh, de...

14:27.656 --> 14:29.291
Uh... fucking cancer.

14:29.291 --> 14:30.625
Oncology?

14:34.296 --> 14:37.499
How... how the fuck
does everyone know that word?

14:41.870 --> 14:44.306
He should be here by now.

14:46.508 --> 14:48.510
It's all good, man.
He's got this.

14:50.012 --> 14:51.981
Come on.

14:55.985 --> 14:58.320
The fuck is that?

14:58.353 --> 15:00.322
It's called blending in.

15:00.355 --> 15:02.591
Bro.

15:02.657 --> 15:04.659
Yeah, nah, dawg.

15:06.061 --> 15:08.197
-ANGEL: Whatever.
-EZ: All right, where we going?

15:08.230 --> 15:10.365
Seventh floor.
Elevator's that way,

15:10.399 --> 15:12.667
but the place is crawling
with fucking Sons.

15:12.701 --> 15:14.703
EZ:
All right, let's go.

15:16.538 --> 15:18.540
*

15:30.719 --> 15:33.222
I say we take it
up to the eighth floor.

15:33.255 --> 15:35.124
Then we cut back downstairs.

15:35.190 --> 15:36.958
-We don't want any surprises.
-(elevator dings)

15:37.026 --> 15:38.927
(men laughing)

15:48.537 --> 15:50.872
MANNY:
Let's go!

15:50.872 --> 15:52.541
-(alarm blaring)
-EZ: Let's get the
fuck out of here!

15:52.541 --> 15:55.044
-(woman shrieks)
-(panicked chatter)

15:55.077 --> 15:56.878
EZ:
Oh, shit.

15:56.911 --> 15:58.380
ANGEL:
Fuck.

16:01.050 --> 16:02.551
Hey, get down!

16:02.551 --> 16:05.054
Let's go. Hey, let's go.

16:05.087 --> 16:07.056
EZ:
Go, go, go! Let's go!

16:07.089 --> 16:09.258
(gunshots continuing)

16:09.291 --> 16:12.494
ANGEL:
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get out of the way!

16:12.561 --> 16:13.562
Move! Move!

16:13.595 --> 16:15.397
(alarm continues)

16:15.397 --> 16:17.166
-(gunshots)
-Come on, go, go, go.

16:17.232 --> 16:20.069
(people shouting, screaming)

16:26.308 --> 16:27.642
EZ:
Move. Move, move.

16:30.745 --> 16:31.846
-WOMAN: Please.
-EZ: Wait, wait...

16:31.913 --> 16:33.448
(screaming)

16:33.482 --> 16:35.117
-MAN: Lock the door. Lock it.
-ANGEL: Over there!

16:35.150 --> 16:36.251
Go, go, go, go!

16:41.323 --> 16:43.758
MAN (over P.A.):
We are now on an active Code 3.

16:43.792 --> 16:46.928
-I repeat, we are now
on an active Code 3.
-Aw, shit. Shit!

16:46.961 --> 16:48.763
MANNY:
There's too many. Find an exit.

16:48.797 --> 16:50.432
I'm gonna draw
some of these fuckers away.

16:50.465 --> 16:52.101
EZ:
Wait, no, Manny, wait!

16:52.134 --> 16:53.968
Hey, we got to go. Come on.

16:54.002 --> 16:56.004
We got to go.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.310
(panicked chatter)

17:01.343 --> 17:03.778
Hey! Stop!

17:03.812 --> 17:05.647
(gunshot)

17:05.680 --> 17:08.117
(grunts)

17:08.117 --> 17:10.952
Help! Help! Help!
We're losing him!

17:10.985 --> 17:12.821
-We got to go now!
-GABRIELA: EZ?

17:18.860 --> 17:21.296
Fucking hell.

17:21.296 --> 17:22.497
-We got to go. Hey, hey, hey.
-No! No!

17:22.531 --> 17:23.798
-Hey, let's go.
-No! No!

17:23.798 --> 17:26.135
-No! Please, no!
-Come on, come on.

17:26.135 --> 17:28.637
We got to go, bro.

17:29.538 --> 17:31.540
GABRIELA:
No! Stop!

17:32.707 --> 17:34.809
RADIO HOST:
As you point out in your book,
cats have made

17:34.809 --> 17:38.480
a very rapid evolution
from the solitary animal

17:38.480 --> 17:40.315
and the animal that catches...

17:40.315 --> 17:41.983
Get out of the car! Out!

17:42.984 --> 17:44.853
(lock clicks)

17:44.886 --> 17:46.721
Open the fucking door.

17:50.159 --> 17:51.926
Hey! I'm-I'm-I'm a doctor!

17:51.993 --> 17:53.027
Get in there!

17:53.061 --> 17:54.263
-(shrieks)
-No, no, get down.

17:54.329 --> 17:56.165
-(gunshot)
-(Gaby screams)

17:56.198 --> 17:58.333
Go, go, go! Go!

18:02.504 --> 18:03.505
EZ:
Shit.

18:03.538 --> 18:05.507
Oh, shit.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.442
Fucking Manny, yeah!

18:07.509 --> 18:08.743
-(honking)
-Hey, hey, hey!

18:30.532 --> 18:33.202
ANGEL: All right, man. Yeah,
yeah. Yeah. All right, cool.

18:33.235 --> 18:35.570
I don't fucking believe it.

18:35.604 --> 18:37.606
Manny got out.

18:38.873 --> 18:41.042
Yeah. Ditched the jeep.

18:41.075 --> 18:43.245
Made it to Oakland.

18:43.278 --> 18:46.047
Crazy fucker said he's gonna
hang over there for a minute,

18:46.047 --> 18:48.750
then catch a ride back to S.P.

18:48.783 --> 18:51.119
You know what, man,
he might be all right.

18:54.256 --> 18:56.258
What's going on with her?

18:58.059 --> 19:00.161
I don't know.

19:00.229 --> 19:02.264
Bro, make sure she keeps

19:02.297 --> 19:04.266
her fucking mouth shut,
all right?

19:04.299 --> 19:06.067
W-We'll drop her off somewhere,

19:06.067 --> 19:08.069
and then
get the fuck out of here.

19:37.499 --> 19:39.501
Hey.

19:42.771 --> 19:44.773
You okay?

19:56.851 --> 19:58.287
Back there, what you saw...

19:58.320 --> 20:00.322
I know what I saw, Ezekiel.

20:01.656 --> 20:03.658
I know that man.

20:06.194 --> 20:08.196
Gerald was my friend.

20:15.370 --> 20:17.639
-I'm sorry.
-He was the first person

20:17.639 --> 20:19.641
to talk to me
when I started here.

20:23.645 --> 20:26.147
I know his wife.

20:26.147 --> 20:28.149
His children.

20:31.486 --> 20:34.323
They're waiting for him
to come home right now.

20:34.323 --> 20:37.225
What kind of animal
destroys a family like that?

20:55.009 --> 20:57.011
Gaby.

21:02.016 --> 21:04.018
You can't tell anyone.

21:05.354 --> 21:07.356
I'm going to tell the police.

21:09.057 --> 21:10.592
What?

21:13.194 --> 21:14.529
You can't.

21:14.529 --> 21:15.897
It's Angel.

21:15.930 --> 21:18.967
And he needs to answer
for what he did.

21:19.033 --> 21:21.870
He shot an innocent man, EZ.

21:28.109 --> 21:30.379
Angel's about
to become a father.

21:30.379 --> 21:33.047
Gerald's kids will never
see their father again.

21:36.918 --> 21:38.653
You lost a parent.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.088
You know what that's like.

21:45.394 --> 21:47.328
My-my brother's kid

21:47.396 --> 21:49.564
can't visit him
through prison glass.

21:50.732 --> 21:52.166
Going to the cops
is not gonna change

21:52.233 --> 21:53.602
what happened to your friend.

21:59.073 --> 22:00.909
I miss you, EZ.

22:00.909 --> 22:03.244
(exhales)

22:03.277 --> 22:05.013
You just left.

22:05.079 --> 22:06.415
No.

22:06.448 --> 22:08.450
Your father said awful things.

22:09.951 --> 22:11.953
I should have
never believed him.

22:11.986 --> 22:14.255
-Everything he said is true.
-It's not.

22:18.126 --> 22:20.128
Ezekiel...

22:24.466 --> 22:26.801
Ezekiel.

22:31.305 --> 22:33.442
I love you.

22:35.777 --> 22:38.613
I know in my heart,

22:38.613 --> 22:40.615
that in your heart,

22:40.615 --> 22:42.617
you are good.

22:47.021 --> 22:49.023
But Angel?

22:50.158 --> 22:52.627
He needs to answer
for what he did.

22:56.865 --> 22:59.668
Your mother would
want you to do the right...

22:59.701 --> 23:01.035
(gunshot)

23:06.508 --> 23:08.242
No!

23:08.309 --> 23:10.645
(grunts) Bro!

23:10.679 --> 23:12.681
What did you do?!

23:14.516 --> 23:16.885
EZ, what the fuck did you do?!

23:17.886 --> 23:19.988
EZ!

23:20.021 --> 23:22.023
What did you do?!

23:28.863 --> 23:30.865
(knocks on door)

23:33.201 --> 23:35.403
(footsteps approaching)

23:39.541 --> 23:41.543
You're late.

23:44.513 --> 23:46.515
Got tied up at work.

23:46.515 --> 23:48.850
(music playing softly)

23:49.884 --> 23:51.853
Hey, you made it.
(laughs)

23:51.886 --> 23:54.188
-Wouldn't miss it.
-Come here.

23:55.857 --> 23:57.859
Please, have a seat.

24:00.361 --> 24:02.864
-May I?
-Ah, I'm good.

24:02.897 --> 24:04.899
-Brought my own.
-Oh.

24:06.535 --> 24:08.369
Okay, well...
(chuckles)

24:08.369 --> 24:11.540
you know, I really appreciate
you making the time, Obispo.

24:12.607 --> 24:14.809
It's been so long, but, hey,

24:14.876 --> 24:16.377
I know you're busy, so...

24:16.377 --> 24:18.046
Actually, I just got a demotion.

24:18.079 --> 24:19.247
Oh.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.315
My schedule's wide open.

24:21.382 --> 24:23.384
Didn't Marcus tell you?

24:23.384 --> 24:24.719
Not in my home.

24:24.753 --> 24:26.254
Hey.

24:27.255 --> 24:29.223
-(laughs)
-Please.

24:29.257 --> 24:31.225
Oh, well,

24:31.225 --> 24:33.161
-these look amazing.
-IZZY: Mm-hmm.

24:33.227 --> 24:35.797
(sighs)

24:37.065 --> 24:38.733
Mm-hmm.

24:40.301 --> 24:42.737
(doorbell rings)

24:42.737 --> 24:44.939
Wait, honey, I got it.

24:49.578 --> 24:50.912
-IZZY: Oh, hey!
-WOMAN: Oh, hey!

24:50.912 --> 24:52.914
-Happy Birthday!
-IZZY: Thank you!

24:52.914 --> 24:55.584
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, but the cake, it had

24:55.617 --> 24:57.085
to cool before I iced it.

24:57.118 --> 24:58.920
IZZY:
Oh, please, no problem.

24:58.953 --> 25:00.589
-We're just getting started,
come on in.
-WOMAN: Okay.

25:00.589 --> 25:02.791
Gentlemen, this is Maggie.

25:02.824 --> 25:04.926
She's my friend,
and I asked her to join us

25:04.959 --> 25:07.128
for my birthday.

25:07.161 --> 25:09.097
Hope you guys like red velvet.

25:09.130 --> 25:11.099
("Love Has Come to Me"
by The Detroit Emeralds playing)

25:11.132 --> 25:15.103
* Love has come to me *

25:17.606 --> 25:20.709
* My eyes are open *

25:20.775 --> 25:24.946
* And I see that *

25:24.979 --> 25:26.547
(exhales)

25:26.615 --> 25:30.284
* Love has come to me *

25:33.454 --> 25:35.456
* Never knew *

25:35.489 --> 25:38.226
* How it could really be... *

25:38.292 --> 25:40.461
Why are you so quiet tonight?

25:40.494 --> 25:43.331
(scoffs) What should I say?

25:44.799 --> 25:46.500
* To be with the one... *

25:46.534 --> 25:48.036
Say your favorite word.

25:50.538 --> 25:51.673
We just did that.

25:51.706 --> 25:55.576
-Fuck's a nice choice.
-Mm-hmm.

25:55.644 --> 25:57.846
* Love has just come in... *

25:57.879 --> 25:59.580
I like "fernweh."

25:59.648 --> 26:01.482
The fuck is that?

26:01.482 --> 26:03.918
(chuckles)

26:03.985 --> 26:06.154
Oh, wait, I s-I see
what you just did there.

26:06.187 --> 26:08.422
Touché.

26:08.489 --> 26:10.158
It's, uh...

26:10.191 --> 26:14.095
it's German for being homesick

26:14.162 --> 26:16.665
for someplace you've never been.

26:17.699 --> 26:19.100
Now you speak German?

26:19.167 --> 26:21.502
(laughs) No.

26:21.502 --> 26:24.005
Shit, I can barely
speak English.

26:27.075 --> 26:29.711
I just know
what that feels like.

26:31.512 --> 26:33.514
To long to be anywhere else.

26:33.514 --> 26:35.717
* For the shape I'm in... *

26:35.750 --> 26:38.019
To be anyone else.

26:40.889 --> 26:42.356
Sometime...

26:42.390 --> 26:45.226
(scoffs) Fuck that.

26:45.259 --> 26:47.361
Most of the time,

26:47.361 --> 26:50.699
I have no idea who...
who the fuck I am.

26:53.702 --> 26:56.204
(sighs)

26:56.237 --> 26:58.206
Wherever you go...

27:00.709 --> 27:01.910
...you're there.

27:01.943 --> 27:03.544
Trust the process.

27:03.577 --> 27:05.213
You haven't said
anything all night

27:05.246 --> 27:08.282
and now you're gonna come at me
with some lazy 12-step bullshit?

27:09.283 --> 27:11.552
If I had wanted that,
I would have fucked Don

27:11.552 --> 27:13.755
in front of
his incredibly sad cat.

27:13.788 --> 27:15.489
You're a trip.

27:15.556 --> 27:17.058
(scoffs) Yeah?

27:17.058 --> 27:19.160
And you got 30 seconds
to bare your soul, motherfucker,

27:19.227 --> 27:21.095
or I'm calling your ass an Uber.

27:22.130 --> 27:25.399
* 'Cause I've been
down there below *

27:25.433 --> 27:28.737
* Many times myself... *

27:28.770 --> 27:32.106
-(laughs): What's up?
-(chuckles)

27:32.140 --> 27:34.242
I guess I'm just worried.

27:36.778 --> 27:38.246
My brothers,

27:38.246 --> 27:41.349
they got something
going down tonight.

27:41.415 --> 27:44.853
I can't stand the thought
of one of them getting hurt

27:44.919 --> 27:46.587
and me not being there.

27:48.089 --> 27:49.924
You can't take care
of everybody.

27:51.592 --> 27:53.127
I can try.

27:53.161 --> 27:55.429
* Love is the reason *

27:55.429 --> 27:58.967
* For livin' girls and boys... *

27:59.000 --> 28:01.102
Do they always take care of you?

28:01.102 --> 28:02.937
Are they all shot-up like this?

28:02.937 --> 28:04.105
Shit.

28:04.138 --> 28:05.606
* Everything... *

28:05.639 --> 28:07.475
I got fucked-up
a few years ago.

28:07.508 --> 28:09.710
* Everything in my life... *

28:09.778 --> 28:13.614
Shot point-blank
by these Samoan motherfuckers.

28:16.117 --> 28:18.052
-You want to know what happened?
-What?

28:18.119 --> 28:21.055
Nothing. Those big-ass
ape motherfuckers

28:21.122 --> 28:22.490
are still out there somewhere.

28:22.523 --> 28:25.226
And it was a joke to the club.

28:25.293 --> 28:27.796
* I believe in love... *

28:27.796 --> 28:30.464
They didn't do
anything about it?

28:30.498 --> 28:31.800
Nah.

28:31.833 --> 28:34.735
Just let it go.

28:34.803 --> 28:37.972
* Proof is my reward... *

28:37.972 --> 28:40.141
Which scar was it?

28:40.141 --> 28:41.642
* The shape I'm in *

28:41.675 --> 28:44.145
-(sighs)
-* And I feel good within *

28:44.178 --> 28:47.481
* 'Cause, 'cause *

28:47.515 --> 28:50.184
* 'Cause, 'cause, 'cause *

28:50.218 --> 28:53.654
* Love has come to me... *

28:53.654 --> 28:54.923
Tell me

28:54.989 --> 28:57.658
about each one.

28:57.691 --> 28:59.994
(scoffs)

29:00.028 --> 29:03.164
Shit, we'll be here all night.

29:03.164 --> 29:05.166
Oh, yeah?

29:05.166 --> 29:06.767
You got somewhere better to be?

29:06.835 --> 29:08.870
* Has come to me... *

29:08.903 --> 29:10.604
-Fuck no.
-(chuckles)

29:10.671 --> 29:13.174
* So sweet, so sweet *

29:13.174 --> 29:14.708
* So sweet, so sweet... *

29:14.742 --> 29:17.678
Tell me about this one.

29:17.678 --> 29:19.180
* Ooh, I said *

29:19.213 --> 29:22.516
* Love *

29:22.516 --> 29:26.855
* Has come to me. *

29:26.888 --> 29:28.389
IZZY:
Really?

29:28.422 --> 29:30.959
We also built shelters in Peru.

29:31.025 --> 29:32.193
IZZY:
Mm!

29:32.193 --> 29:35.563
The people were so warm
and welcoming.

29:35.596 --> 29:36.965
I saw Machu Picchu.

29:37.031 --> 29:39.367
-Oh, wow.
-MAGGIE: It's hard to describe,

29:39.400 --> 29:41.535
but it was amazing.

29:41.535 --> 29:43.537
Wait, but I thought
it was closed to the public.

29:43.537 --> 29:46.074
Yes, but you can
arrange for a guide.

29:46.107 --> 29:47.475
Oh, honey, we should go.

29:47.541 --> 29:49.210
-Definitely.
-Mm-hmm.

29:49.243 --> 29:52.313
-Wouldn't you like to go?
-(kick)

29:52.380 --> 29:54.048
-ALVAREZ: Primo.
-What?

29:54.048 --> 29:56.084
IZZY:
Wouldn't you like
to go to Machu Picchu?

29:57.251 --> 29:58.719
(scoffs)

29:58.719 --> 30:00.721
(glass clatters)

30:00.754 --> 30:03.224
MAGGIE:
Have you travelled much, Obispo?

30:06.127 --> 30:08.396
Been to Iraq a couple times.

30:11.132 --> 30:13.067
Al-Qaeda... (scoffs)

30:13.101 --> 30:16.270
So warm and welcoming.

30:16.304 --> 30:19.073
It was... (laughs)

30:19.073 --> 30:20.441
amazing.

30:24.745 --> 30:26.647
Thank you for your service,
Obispo.

30:30.118 --> 30:32.353
Izzy tells me
you're into motorcycles.

30:32.420 --> 30:33.754
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah.

30:36.590 --> 30:38.359
You ride?

30:38.426 --> 30:40.628
(laughs) No.

30:40.661 --> 30:44.032
No, my son wanted one,
but with the babies,

30:44.098 --> 30:46.100
my daughter-in-law
won't stand for it.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.601
(chuckles)

30:47.601 --> 30:48.802
Wow.

30:51.105 --> 30:52.273
You're a grandma.

30:52.306 --> 30:53.975
MAGGIE:
I am.

30:54.008 --> 30:55.609
Is that a problem?

30:55.609 --> 30:56.810
No.

30:57.845 --> 30:59.981
No.

31:00.014 --> 31:01.715
I'm sure it's great.

31:01.782 --> 31:03.117
I'm sure we got loads
to talk about.

31:03.151 --> 31:05.153
(chuckles):
I'm sorry.

31:05.186 --> 31:06.820
-Maybe we should just, uh...
-MAGGIE: It's-it's okay.

31:06.854 --> 31:09.157
I love being a grandparent.

31:10.959 --> 31:13.327
When you become one,
you'll see, it's a blessing.

31:16.164 --> 31:18.799
Something about holding
your baby's baby...

31:21.369 --> 31:23.371
It's beautiful.

31:29.177 --> 31:30.678
(utensils clatter)

31:30.711 --> 31:33.147
Uh...

31:33.181 --> 31:34.648
I think I'm gonna leave.

31:34.682 --> 31:36.150
(grunts) Oh...

31:37.385 --> 31:39.653
I'm good. (chuckles)

31:39.653 --> 31:41.489
Been a long day.

31:41.522 --> 31:42.991
I'll show myself out.

31:42.991 --> 31:44.592
Wait, we haven't
had dessert yet.

31:44.658 --> 31:46.694
BISHOP:
Happy birthday.

31:46.727 --> 31:48.829
(door opens)

31:50.331 --> 31:52.333
(door closes)

31:59.240 --> 32:01.009
A grandma? Really?

32:01.009 --> 32:02.343
She's three years
younger than you, primo.

32:02.343 --> 32:04.345
Yeah?
Tell her face that.

32:04.345 --> 32:06.114
Izzy was just trying
to do something nice for you.

32:06.180 --> 32:07.781
She's worried about you
and so am I.

32:07.848 --> 32:09.283
Oh.

32:09.350 --> 32:11.019
Now you're fucking
worried about me?

32:11.019 --> 32:13.554
Our bond, primo,
it runs deeper than the club.

32:13.587 --> 32:15.023
(laughs)

32:15.023 --> 32:17.691
Hey, if you fucking say so, man.

32:20.061 --> 32:21.629
If you don't like
the way I'm running this club,

32:21.695 --> 32:23.297
you can get the fuck out.

32:23.364 --> 32:25.899
You know what your problem is?

32:25.933 --> 32:28.869
Your head is in there.
It's not with the club.

32:28.902 --> 32:31.972
That's why you're scared to
pull the fucking trigger, man.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.208
Nobody wins if our brothers
are dying on the street.

32:34.242 --> 32:35.543
Our brothers are already
fucking dying

32:35.543 --> 32:36.577
in the streets, primo.

32:37.878 --> 32:39.280
Wake the fuck up.

32:41.282 --> 32:43.284
(engine starts)

32:52.793 --> 32:54.795
(door opens)

33:09.477 --> 33:12.480
Um... So sorry.

33:14.582 --> 33:16.417
It's fine.

33:17.418 --> 33:19.420
It's fine, Angel.

33:25.593 --> 33:26.960
ANGEL:
What's going on?

33:28.962 --> 33:31.932
(exhales)

33:31.965 --> 33:33.967
I thought I wanted this.

33:35.969 --> 33:38.772
That I wanted you.

33:38.772 --> 33:41.041
(sighs)

33:41.109 --> 33:43.944
And I was so happy
that you let me into your life.

33:45.979 --> 33:48.116
And I always knew
something was wrong.

33:48.116 --> 33:50.151
That something was off.

33:50.184 --> 33:54.222
But I thought I could fix it.

33:54.288 --> 33:57.458
-I thought I could
fix you, but...
-Hey, hey, hey.

34:00.027 --> 34:01.462
(sniffles)

34:03.464 --> 34:07.201
I know I've been busy.

34:11.472 --> 34:13.474
I've just been...

34:15.476 --> 34:16.844
...scared.

34:19.380 --> 34:20.814
No.

34:22.816 --> 34:24.017
No.

34:26.154 --> 34:28.489
-No. You don't get to say that!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey...

34:28.522 --> 34:32.360
Not now. It is too late.

34:32.393 --> 34:34.662
Whatever I did...

34:35.829 --> 34:36.930
I am sorry.

34:36.997 --> 34:40.268
I swear to you.

34:40.334 --> 34:42.170
I know I'm fucked-up.

34:44.172 --> 34:45.539
I know this.

34:46.540 --> 34:48.676
But I can change.

34:50.678 --> 34:52.380
I can.

34:54.382 --> 34:55.716
Listen, tonight, it...

34:57.718 --> 35:00.521
(sighs) It was so fucked-up.
My brother...

35:00.554 --> 35:03.056
Oh, my God!
I am done with that shit.

35:03.090 --> 35:05.626
-I'm leaving.
-Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

35:05.693 --> 35:09.230
-What?
-I am going, Angel.

35:11.532 --> 35:12.900
(exhales)

35:14.902 --> 35:16.103
What about the baby?

35:20.441 --> 35:21.709
No.

35:24.111 --> 35:25.946
(crying softly)

35:26.947 --> 35:28.382
No.

35:31.452 --> 35:33.887
(sniffles)

35:33.887 --> 35:35.323
Stephanie.

35:35.389 --> 35:37.325
He's gone.

35:37.391 --> 35:39.293
What do you... What does
that mean? What do you mean?

35:42.730 --> 35:44.932
What does that mean?

35:49.237 --> 35:51.639
What the fuck did you do?

35:53.641 --> 35:57.245
Your father
took me to the hospital.

35:57.278 --> 35:59.112
My father brought you
to the hospital?

35:59.146 --> 36:00.914
-Yeah.
-And nobody called me?

36:00.948 --> 36:02.583
Oh, and what were you gonna do?

36:06.086 --> 36:08.088
What were you gonna do?

36:12.593 --> 36:14.962
What have you ever done, Angel?

36:17.265 --> 36:18.632
(scoffs)

36:21.602 --> 36:23.103
Right.

36:41.689 --> 36:43.691
It was a nice dream.

37:08.882 --> 37:10.884
*

37:27.368 --> 37:29.370
(insects chirping)

37:55.396 --> 37:57.365
This, this isn't...

37:57.398 --> 37:59.199
Take off your clothes.

38:26.226 --> 38:28.228
(knocking on door)

38:32.900 --> 38:34.902
(door opens)

38:36.236 --> 38:38.238
(door closes)

38:45.746 --> 38:47.748
(sighs)

38:54.121 --> 38:55.956
Where's Stephanie?

39:00.327 --> 39:01.962
Gone.

39:13.607 --> 39:15.509
I'm sorry, son.

39:20.648 --> 39:24.151
I know what it's like
to have a child torn...

39:26.620 --> 39:30.458
...from you before you
get a chance to hold them.

39:30.491 --> 39:34.662
You wonder what to do
with that love

39:34.695 --> 39:38.165
that right now feels like pain.

39:39.199 --> 39:40.834
And what did you do?

39:40.868 --> 39:42.870
I had you.

39:45.473 --> 39:47.675
I had your brother.

39:47.708 --> 39:49.142
You move on.

39:51.144 --> 39:53.146
And you forgive.

39:56.216 --> 39:57.851
No.

40:01.555 --> 40:03.991
No.

40:03.991 --> 40:06.660
What the fuck...

40:06.694 --> 40:08.529
did you do?

40:14.835 --> 40:17.505
Why is this family so fucked?

40:20.674 --> 40:22.009
Why...

40:22.042 --> 40:25.846
Why do we destroy everything?

40:26.847 --> 40:30.017
Why do we lose everyone?

40:30.050 --> 40:33.286
What did you do
that was so fucking wrong

40:33.353 --> 40:37.224
that God had fucking
rained hell all over us?

40:37.257 --> 40:40.060
What did you do to curse us?

40:43.897 --> 40:45.098
You know what? Get out.

40:47.100 --> 40:49.369
-Angel, son...
-Get the fuck out of my house!

40:51.371 --> 40:53.373
Get out!

41:10.558 --> 41:12.560
(door opens)

41:14.094 --> 41:16.096
(door closes)

41:23.403 --> 41:24.905
Letty, let me in.

41:24.938 --> 41:26.740
-(pounding continues)
-Letty.

41:26.774 --> 41:28.241
Letty. Hey.

41:28.241 --> 41:30.644
What are you doing here?

41:32.646 --> 41:34.247
-What the fuck
are you doing here?
-I had to come see you.

41:34.247 --> 41:36.249
Yo, how drunk are you?

41:36.283 --> 41:38.018
I'm not drunk.

41:38.085 --> 41:41.254
I just, I can't stop
thinking about you.

41:41.254 --> 41:44.257
I can't stop
thinking about yesterday.

41:44.291 --> 41:46.760
Angel, yesterday
was a mistake, okay?

41:46.794 --> 41:49.462
-No. No.
-A terrible fucking mistake.

41:49.496 --> 41:52.465
-No. No, no, no. No, no,
hey, hey. No, no, no.
-Angel, stop, stop.

41:52.499 --> 41:54.635
It's okay. It's okay.

41:54.668 --> 41:57.537
-This is good. Hey.
-No, it is not okay,
it is not good.

41:57.605 --> 41:59.707
Angel, we're fucked-up.

41:59.773 --> 42:02.475
What happened yesterday
will never happen again.

42:02.509 --> 42:04.444
-Okay?
-No, hey, don't say that...

42:04.444 --> 42:06.346
-No, Angel stop
fucking touching...
-What's up?

42:09.983 --> 42:11.819
GILLY:
The fuck's all this?

42:14.287 --> 42:16.389
-You didn't.
-I...

42:16.456 --> 42:19.126
-LETICIA: Stop! Yo!
-His fucking daughter?

42:19.159 --> 42:21.795
-Hey, stop!
-His fucking daughter!

42:21.795 --> 42:23.831
-Stop it! Gilly, stop!
-Fuck... Fuck!

42:23.864 --> 42:25.298
-Get up, Angel!
-Fucking kill you!

42:25.332 --> 42:28.401
-Stop! Get... Stop it! Stop!
-Get up! Get up!

42:28.468 --> 42:30.137
-Stop!
-Fucking fight me! Get up!
-No.

42:30.170 --> 42:33.340
-Get up and fucking fight me,
you fucking bitch!
-No...

42:33.373 --> 42:35.909
-Fuck you, motherfucker.
-I... I'm all fucked-up.

42:35.976 --> 42:37.978
-LETICIA: Get the fuck
out of my house!
-Fuck you!

42:38.011 --> 42:39.813
-Can't fucking believe this.
In his fucking house.
-Both of you,

42:39.847 --> 42:41.649
get the fuck out of my house!

42:41.682 --> 42:43.516
(grunts)
I'm sorry.

43:10.577 --> 43:13.213
-It was, uh...
-Are you here?

43:17.084 --> 43:19.386
Are you back safe with Sally

43:19.419 --> 43:21.689
and me?

43:21.722 --> 43:23.356
Are we safe?

43:27.895 --> 43:29.730
Are you safe?

43:37.037 --> 43:39.206
That's all I care about.

43:57.090 --> 43:58.726
Stephanie.

44:07.735 --> 44:09.737
(short chuckle)

44:14.074 --> 44:16.910
I can't fucking believe it.

44:18.912 --> 44:20.748
Of course you would
show up tonight.

44:20.748 --> 44:23.751
-Angel...
-I don't want to hear

44:23.751 --> 44:28.255
anything out of your
fucking mouth.

44:28.255 --> 44:31.925
You can't keep
doing this shit to me.

44:31.925 --> 44:34.594
You can't!

44:34.627 --> 44:38.365
I can't do this
with you anymore.

44:38.431 --> 44:40.433
-I can't.

45:11.664 --> 45:13.500
My boy.

My boy.

My boy.

46:11.058 --> 46:14.394

46:16.763 --> 46:20.533
* And a kiss on my cheek *

* You butter me up *
