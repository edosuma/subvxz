01:14.341 --> 01:16.608
- Looks great, Gretchen.
- Thanks, Tim.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.259
Hey, Mary.
Could you give this to Gary?

01:34.295 --> 01:35.327
Thank you.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.008
Please tell me you went home
and slept last night, Steven.

01:50.044 --> 01:52.978
We break ground on the museum
this afternoon.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.180
That's not an answer.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.983
What is that tie?

01:58.018 --> 02:02.121
It's my "Christmas is
only a few weeks away" tie.

02:02.156 --> 02:05.357
It's very, festive.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.625
Sorry if I actually enjoy

02:06.660 --> 02:08.293
getting into
the spirit of Christmas.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.062
Hey, I enjoy Christmas.
It's the one day a year

02:11.098 --> 02:15.033
I don't answer my cell phone
on the first ring.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.503
Rachel wanted to talk to you.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.849
Looks like we might
have an investor

02:18.873 --> 02:20.139
for the shopping center.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.740
More than a chance.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.709
They want to hear pitches
this week.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.978
And if they like what they hear,
they'll invest.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.524
Steven, I need you
to take the lead on this.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.715
Yeah, no problem.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.050
I know you're super busy
with the museum.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.752
No. I can totally do both.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.155
You land this pitch,
and I have a feeling

02:36.190 --> 02:39.424
the board will have no problem
making you a partner.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.628
And, Tom, you're next in line.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.001
Where you going?

02:49.036 --> 02:52.704
Big day ahead.
Gotta refuel on espresso.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.410
I am so sorry!

02:58.445 --> 03:01.747
No, no, it's my fault.
I...

03:01.782 --> 03:04.283
I wasn't looking
where I was going.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.285
What is this?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.953
It's snow.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.190
Well, it's fake snow
from all the decorations.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.632
That... That is
a lot of Christmas.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.535
Well, it is almost Christmas.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.704
Right. Yeah, I just...

03:25.739 --> 03:27.706
I didn't expect to see
the building lobby

03:27.741 --> 03:29.274
decked out this much.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.210
Well, the building manager
just hired me.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.445
I'm a holiday decorator.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.247
That's a thing?

03:35.282 --> 03:38.584
And it's a really great job.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.152
People love holiday cheer,

03:40.187 --> 03:42.387
and they like when their
surroundings reflect that.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.924
It's just...
It's a bit much.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.328
Are you always this harsh
on Christmas,

03:49.363 --> 03:51.296
or just when
you're covered in snow?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.832
No, I'm not being harsh.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.603
Okay, it's just that...
It's just...

03:57.638 --> 03:58.904
Christmas is one day a year.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.939
I think people
go overboard for it.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.141
Actually, it's a lot more
than just one day a year.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.244
It's the whole season
of wonderful things.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.579
And I think people
should go overboard.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.582
I can tell
you're passionate about it.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.818
It's not really my thing.

04:12.853 --> 04:16.355
Okay, well, I'm really sorry
about your sweater.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.091
And you know what?
Honestly, it just looks like

04:19.125 --> 04:21.125
you could've used
the holiday cheer, so...

04:21.161 --> 04:22.261
Merry Christmas.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.117
Hey, Marie.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.719
Hey. They gave me an extra
cappuccino this morning.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.389
Thank you. I had another
decorating job earlier.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.824
- A building on West Sixth.
- That's great news!

04:52.860 --> 04:55.727
That's, what, like your
second new client this month?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.896
Right? I mean, I'm so thankful

04:57.931 --> 05:00.365
for Nolan letting me
work here part-time,

05:00.401 --> 05:02.200
but if I just get
a few more clients,

05:02.236 --> 05:04.736
I can take on
holiday decorating full-time.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.371
- Fingers crossed.
- Yes! I mean,

05:06.407 --> 05:08.640
getting to decorate
the look of a space?

05:08.676 --> 05:11.643
Complete creative control?
There's nothing like it.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.478
- Morning, Gretchen.
- Good morning.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.514
Need to go over the setup
for the desk catalog.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.249
Gave some notes
on your last layout.

05:17.284 --> 05:20.819
They need less color
and want it to feel more crisp.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.754
What's that supposed to mean?

05:22.790 --> 05:25.157
Not exactly sure, but I told 'em
you could figure it out.

05:25.192 --> 05:28.360
<i>Also, we're shooting the display
for Woodfire Magazine.</i>

05:28.395 --> 05:30.373
Here's a description of how
the company wants it to look,

05:30.397 --> 05:32.431
so just do you did last time

05:32.466 --> 05:34.266
and give them exactly
what they want.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.567
Thanks.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.937
Complete creative control,
you say?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.039
That's the dream.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.206
Aunt Lindsay,
these companies all want

06:14.241 --> 06:16.074
such specific looks
for their catalogs.

06:16.110 --> 06:18.710
No matter how many ideas I
suggest, it just doesn't matter.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.145
Nobody listens.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.947
I know it's only
a part-time job,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.715
but I still wish you could quit.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.550
Focus full-time
on your business.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.253
I can't. Not until things
pick up a little more.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.122
And who knows how long
that will be?

06:30.157 --> 06:32.257
Right now you're
splitting your energy.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.327
Maybe all you need to do
is focus on one thing,

06:35.362 --> 06:36.928
the thing
you're passionate about.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.098
I will. I just need
a few more clients first.

06:40.134 --> 06:43.068
I wish I could pay you for
helping me decorate this place.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.838
Don't be silly!
The inn is what inspired me

06:46.874 --> 06:48.840
to even start
Holidays Made To Order.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.076
One of my favorite
Christmas traditions

06:51.111 --> 06:52.644
is decorating this place
with you.

06:52.679 --> 06:53.945
Mine as well.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.097
<i>Uncle Steven!</i>

07:12.132 --> 07:14.666
<i>- Working late? That's new.
- Hey, Paige.</i>

07:14.701 --> 07:16.968
<i>How'd the volleyball tournament
go last week?</i>

07:17.004 --> 07:19.838
That was a month ago,
but it went well.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.974
Good. You are by far
my most talented niece.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.376
<i>I'm your only niece.</i>

07:24.411 --> 07:26.011
That has nothing to do with it.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.646
Did you get ahold
of Uncle Steven?

07:30.384 --> 07:31.616
<i>Hey, sis.</i>

07:31.652 --> 07:33.185
Oh, good.
I need to talk to you.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.387
<i>I know, I know.
I need to book my flight,</i>

07:35.422 --> 07:38.156
<i>but it looks like this year's
gonna be another year</i>

07:38.192 --> 07:40.292
<i>of me just flying to your place
on Christmas Eve</i>

07:40.327 --> 07:42.194
<i>and then flying back
on the 26th.</i>

07:42.229 --> 07:44.296
- Plans are changing.
- How so?

07:44.331 --> 07:46.331
<i>A pipe burst in our house.</i>

07:46.366 --> 07:48.300
<i>Thankfully, we caught it
before this place</i>

07:48.335 --> 07:50.469
<i>turned into
an indoor swimming pool.</i>

07:50.504 --> 07:52.137
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.139
<i>It's gonna be a major job
to repair it,</i>

07:54.174 --> 07:56.975
so they're turning our water off
for at least a week.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.044
<i>- Yikes.
- Exactly, so...</i>

07:59.079 --> 08:02.047
<i>obviously, we can't host
Christmas this year.</i>

08:02.082 --> 08:04.483
No, no, I wouldn't
expect you to.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.685
And since Mom and Dad
moved into that condo,

08:06.720 --> 08:08.887
they don't have enough space
for all of us.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.324
So what are you saying?

08:12.359 --> 08:14.893
What if we all came to you?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.595
<i>You could host Christmas
this year.</i>

08:16.630 --> 08:19.431
Oh, no, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.366
<i>I have got a lot
going on at work,</i>

08:21.401 --> 08:24.069
<i>and in no way
am I prepared for this.</i>

08:24.104 --> 08:25.937
I mean, I don't even
have a tree.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.106
<i>Come on. You've never done it.</i>

08:28.141 --> 08:30.041
It's long past due.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.544
Plus I already told Mom
that you would.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.778
What? Why?

08:33.813 --> 08:36.448
Because you love us,
and you miss us,

08:36.482 --> 08:39.384
and you have that nice house,
and it would be fun.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.919
And did I mention you love us?

08:41.955 --> 08:44.556
I don't think you guys would
have any fun, you know?

08:44.591 --> 08:45.957
I have to work the whole time.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.626
Please, Uncle Steven.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.295
Visiting you will be way more
fun than staying here.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.331
<i>Plus I want to see what
Christmas is like in Salt Lake.</i>

08:55.569 --> 08:58.370
Okay. Yes. Let's...

08:58.405 --> 09:01.072
Let's have Christmas
at my place.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.143
No, I totally understand.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.712
And if your company has a budget
for a decorator next year,

09:07.748 --> 09:10.048
I also do other holidays.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.583
Hello?

09:13.453 --> 09:15.220
New client?

09:15.255 --> 09:18.790
No. Actually,
it was a cancellation.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.792
I know what will cheer you up.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.628
That guy Pete I've been seeing,
we're going out tonight,

09:23.664 --> 09:25.397
and he has
a really cute friend, Josh.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.798
I already told you,

09:26.833 --> 09:28.433
I am not ready
to get into anything.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.001
Thank you.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.337
It's been months
since you and Zach split.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.573
I think that a fun night out
will do you good.

09:34.608 --> 09:35.740
Do you know what I need?

09:35.776 --> 09:38.143
I need a new client,

09:38.178 --> 09:40.045
not a new boyfriend.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.357
Don't be stressed.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.037
You've pitched to investors
this big before.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.127
I'm sure you'll do great.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.197
It's not the pitch.
I found out last night

09:59.232 --> 10:01.466
that my entire family
is coming here for Christmas.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.934
Nice!

10:02.970 --> 10:05.170
No, it's not.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.873
Each year, my sister throws
this elaborate family holiday.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.775
Everything is perfect.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.278
And now they're all coming here,
and they expect the same.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.291
My mom texted me last night
saying how excited she is

10:15.315 --> 10:17.115
to see my place all decorated,

10:17.150 --> 10:19.784
and I don't think that the Santa
reindeer that I picked up

10:19.820 --> 10:21.219
is really gonna cut it.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.988
Okay, breathe.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.990
I'm sure your family knows
you're busy with work

10:25.025 --> 10:26.358
and will cut you some slack.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.493
I come from a family
of overachievers.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.162
If it's not perfect,
it ain't good.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.064
So hire someone.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.566
Do people do that?

10:34.601 --> 10:36.368
Ask around.

10:36.403 --> 10:40.038
Actually, wait a minute.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.240
The other day
I ran into this woman

10:42.275 --> 10:44.409
who was hired to decorate
the building lobby.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.646
There you go.
Ask the guy in the lobby.

10:47.681 --> 10:51.316
I'm sure he'll give you
her name. What?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.585
We didn't really get off
to a great start.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.855
Still worth a try.
I mean, what else you gonna do?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.061
- She did a nice job.
- Thank you.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.529
You bet.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.436
This looks great.
It's perfect.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.705
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course, well done.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.507
Take a break.
Go grab some lunch.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.574
- Marie.
- Good job.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.750
Hello, this is Gretchen.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.453
<i>Hey, it's Steven Brenner.</i>

11:28.488 --> 11:30.622
<i>We met the other day
in my building lobby.</i>

11:30.657 --> 11:34.259
<i>Well, actually, we sort of
ran into each other</i>

11:34.294 --> 11:35.527
<i>in my building lobby.</i>

11:35.562 --> 11:37.195
<i>The snow is all water-based,</i>

11:37.230 --> 11:39.197
<i>so it should come
right out of your sweater.</i>

11:39.232 --> 11:42.400
No, no, the sweater's fine.
That's not why I'm calling.

11:42.436 --> 11:45.403
I actually wanted to hire you
for your services.

11:45.439 --> 11:46.971
You're kidding.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.040
<i>No, no, I'm not.</i>

11:49.076 --> 11:50.775
I know that's probably
the last thing

11:50.811 --> 11:52.944
you expect me
to be calling about,

11:52.979 --> 11:56.314
given our...
our exchange.

11:56.349 --> 12:00.051
<i>My entire family is
coming in for the holiday,</i>

12:00.087 --> 12:03.421
<i>and I need my house
decorated for Christmas</i>

12:03.457 --> 12:05.957
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

12:05.992 --> 12:09.427
Yeah. I can actually be there
this afternoon.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.298
Okay, great.

12:13.333 --> 12:17.302
I will,
I'll send you my address.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.303
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:18.338 --> 12:20.538
Thank you. Bye.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.377
Three gigs in one month?
Okay.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.302
There's someone at the door.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.471
- Yeah.
- Hi.

12:53.507 --> 12:56.341
I'll get those sketches
over tonight. Gotta go.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.876
Sorry about that.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.011
I'm not usually home from work
this early.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.624
Thank you for coming over
on such short notice.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.948
All in the name of Christmas.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.850
Exactly.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.018
Come on in.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.962
I really like your neighborhood.

13:17.998 --> 13:22.400
All the other houses are
very festive and decorated.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.637
Yours is nice too.
It's just...

13:25.672 --> 13:28.540
It'll be fun to start
with a blank slate

13:30.043 --> 13:32.610
I've got my work cut out for me.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.182
So what kind of Christmas
are you looking for?

13:37.217 --> 13:40.084
I can do traditional, modern.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.822
We can go full-blown North Pole
with animatronic reindeer.

13:43.857 --> 13:47.492
I guess I was just thinking...

13:47.527 --> 13:49.060
Christmas.

13:49.095 --> 13:53.932
Okay, well, how about
I just take a look around?

13:53.967 --> 13:55.600
I will get some measurements

13:55.635 --> 13:59.037
and just get a feel
for your place.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.573
By all means.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.378
Is this your family?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.880
Yeah, the ones that are coming.

14:08.915 --> 14:12.050
You look like
you're really close.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.886
We are. That's why I want
to make this special for them.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.860
Will you help me measure
the kitchen island?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.261
Yeah.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.864
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the island.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.065
Thank you.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.401
Here you go.

14:30.437 --> 14:36.307
So does your family also believe
that Christmas decorations are...

14:36.343 --> 14:39.544
how did you put it...
a little much?

14:39.579 --> 14:42.146
I shouldn't have said that.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.750
I was really flustered
from all this stuff at work.

14:45.785 --> 14:49.420
I was designing a new building,
so I'm sorry.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.155
Are you an architect?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.791
Yeah. I work for
Geyser Corporation.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.828
I can design a building,
just can't decorate the inside.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.930
Well, don't even worry.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.766
I already have a bunch of ideas
for this place.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.569
So tomorrow after work,

15:04.604 --> 15:06.638
I will just go pick up
a whole bunch of stuff,

15:06.673 --> 15:08.606
then get started.

15:08.642 --> 15:09.807
This isn't your job?

15:09.843 --> 15:13.077
I stage for a catalog,

15:13.113 --> 15:16.848
but it's really mundane
and restrictive.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.349
But it's a job.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.084
So I started
Holidays Made To Order

15:20.120 --> 15:21.586
as my passion project,

15:21.621 --> 15:25.456
and I hope to make it my job.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.091
I didn't realize this before,

15:27.127 --> 15:30.328
but it's actually
not a bad business idea.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.630
Oh, well, I don't
just do Christmas.

15:32.666 --> 15:36.834
Thanksgiving,
Fourth of July, Halloween.

15:36.870 --> 15:39.938
Basically if it's a day off
with a whole lot of food,

15:39.973 --> 15:41.439
that's my time to shine.

15:41.474 --> 15:45.977
But really, Christmas
is my favorite holiday.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.513
Good, 'cause I need some help.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.550
Well, you don't have
to worry about a thing.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.852
Tomorrow I am gonna come back

15:54.888 --> 15:59.123
and transform this place
into a Christmas wonderland.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.056
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.324
Do you need help?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.760
That seems dangerous
for one person.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.395
It's okay. I'm a pro.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.764
Yeah, I don't doubt that.
It's just...

16:39.799 --> 16:41.866
heights make me nervous.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.202
So...

16:44.237 --> 16:45.837
let me help.

16:45.872 --> 16:46.971
Thanks.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.043
So what made you
get in the Christmas business?

16:52.078 --> 16:54.679
My aunt, she owns an inn

16:54.714 --> 16:56.514
right outside of the city
in Silverpine,

16:56.549 --> 16:59.851
and growing up, it was my job
to decorate for every holiday.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.219
Silverpine, yeah.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.920
I've heard of it.
Never been.

17:02.956 --> 17:04.888
What? It's amazing!

17:04.924 --> 17:06.902
It's right outside of the city,
but when you go there,

17:06.925 --> 17:08.693
it feels like
this whole other world,

17:08.728 --> 17:09.694
especially at Christmastime.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.029
They have carolers,

17:11.064 --> 17:12.430
and this old-school
movie theater

17:12.464 --> 17:14.232
plays all these
Christmas movies.

17:14.267 --> 17:18.102
And my aunt, she hosts
this apple cider-making party.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.204
The whole neighborhood's there.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.073
It's really great.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.608
I love Christmas.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.009
Sounds neat.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.046
Will you hand me those lights?

17:28.080 --> 17:30.415
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.950
- Little knot here.
- Yeah.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.222
Cute.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.295
All right, they just texted me,

17:44.330 --> 17:46.964
so they should be here
any minute.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.967
What do you think?

17:50.003 --> 17:54.505
The room. What do you think?

17:57.677 --> 18:00.611
My family might
actually be in shock.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.114
You still need to get
a Christmas tree.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.494
I thought that was something fun
you could do with your family.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.452
Yeah, if there's time.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.887
Just make time.

18:11.791 --> 18:12.890
They're here.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.259
It's gonna be great.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.828
Here we go.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.970
Maybe we could order a pizza.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.206
Merry Christmas.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.007
Uncle Steven!

18:30.043 --> 18:31.954
You know the front of your house
is decorated, right?

18:31.978 --> 18:33.644
- Yeah.
- Hey, Steve!

18:33.680 --> 18:35.847
Hosting Christmas!
Who would've thought?

18:35.882 --> 18:38.516
I'm so excited that we're doing
Christmas at your house.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.184
- Hi, Mom.
- Really, son.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.198
She's very eager to see
how this all comes together.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.555
We all are.

18:44.591 --> 18:48.426
So am I.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.929
- My God.
- Certainly smells festive.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.132
- What?
- Yes.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.534
Oh, my goodness.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.971
Never seen anything like this.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.140
Uncle Steven,
this looks amazing.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.641
Did you do this?

19:03.676 --> 19:07.979
Not exactly.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.680
Everyone,

19:09.716 --> 19:12.216
I'd like you to meet my
Christmas decorator, Gretchen.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.451
Hello.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.153
Well, the place is lovely.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.621
Thank you.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.656
That's my dad Ben, my mom Ellen,

19:18.691 --> 19:20.491
my sister Kirsten,

19:20.527 --> 19:22.460
my brother-in-law Jeff,

19:22.495 --> 19:24.295
- and my lovely niece Paige.
- Hello.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.999
That was a lot of names.
It's lovely to meet you all.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.034
See, honey? I told you
Steven would come through.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.303
Nothing to worry about.
Isn't that right, Steven?

19:32.338 --> 19:35.306
Well, I don't know about
the rest of the week,

19:35.341 --> 19:37.542
but, the house...

19:37.577 --> 19:40.311
I mean, the house is
definitely on point.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.186
Yeah, well, what should I do
with the presents?

19:42.215 --> 19:43.347
I don't see a tree.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.415
Don't have one yet.

19:44.450 --> 19:48.085
Got any food? I'm starving.

19:48.121 --> 19:51.055
So what's there to do
in Salt Lake for Christmas?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.757
Well, you...

19:52.792 --> 19:54.670
There's actually a lot
happening with your family,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.827
so I'm gonna get out of here.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.364
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.766
Yeah, of course.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.668
- Excuse us.
- Bye.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.336
We need to talk.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.539
So...

20:08.575 --> 20:11.676
They seem really happy.
I think today was a success.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.077
So I want to hire you.

20:13.112 --> 20:16.347
I thought you already hired me.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.082
No, not as a decorator.

20:18.117 --> 20:22.353
I want to hire you
for all things Christmas.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.388
Be a Christmas ambassador.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.225
I don't know what this means.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.227
My family's expecting
a week filled with

20:29.262 --> 20:30.595
fun Christmas activities,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.697
and I don't even know
where to start.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.532
I have a pitch coming up,

20:34.567 --> 20:36.968
and I can't be there for them
the way that they deserve.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.570
They need someone who loves
and appreciates Christmas

20:39.606 --> 20:42.373
to make it
the best year it can be.

20:42.408 --> 20:46.811
- I'm just a decorator.
- Well, then think of it as...

20:46.846 --> 20:50.748
decorating for the entire
Christmas experience.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.217
Name your price.

20:53.253 --> 20:57.788
Well, this is the most
interesting offer I've ever had.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.291
You do this,
and I will talk to my boss

21:00.326 --> 21:03.294
about making you the official
decorator for Geyser.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.895
All the buildings.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.731
You would do that?

21:06.766 --> 21:09.033
Yeah, I would.

21:11.204 --> 21:12.637
You have yourself a deal.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.006
Great. Thank you.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.907
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.442
Okay.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.916
Gretchen, I can't believe
how great this place looks.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.319
Thank you.
I'm so glad you guys like it.

21:28.354 --> 21:30.621
I've actually just asked
Gretchen to stay on

21:30.657 --> 21:33.658
as our official
Christmas coordinator

21:33.693 --> 21:35.092
I've got a lot of work to do,

21:35.128 --> 21:37.261
and she knows Christmas
better than anyone,

21:37.297 --> 21:39.096
so she agreed to help out.

21:39.132 --> 21:42.433
You hired someone
to help us do Christmas?

21:42.468 --> 21:46.137
- Yes.
- I think it's a good idea.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.606
That's very nice of you.
Are you sure?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.274
Oh, I love it.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.121
I know how much Steven
wants you to have a good time,

21:52.145 --> 21:53.644
so it's perfect.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.479
I think that's cool.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.115
It's like having your own
personal Christmas tour guide.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.618
First up, tomorrow we could
go pick out a Christmas tree.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.486
A little family outing.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.156
There's a great Christmas tree
farm right outside the city.

22:05.191 --> 22:08.693
Go and find the biggest tree.
Whatever one you want.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.394
You pick it out, Paige.
It's on me.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.629
You're not coming?

22:11.664 --> 22:12.730
I can't.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.031
I've got too much work to do.

22:14.067 --> 22:18.002
Son, we all came here
to be with you.

22:18.037 --> 22:21.339
You can't take a few hours off
to come pick out a tree?

22:21.374 --> 22:24.342
I was really looking forward
to hanging out with you.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.718
You know what?
I'll work extra late tonight,

22:33.753 --> 22:37.288
so I can take
some time off tomorrow.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.558
You guys are gonna love it.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.405
The key to finding
the perfect Christmas tree

22:54.440 --> 22:56.841
is finding one
with the strongest scent,

22:56.876 --> 23:00.177
and where when you bend
the needles, they don't snap.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.847
What kind of tree
holds the needles the best?

23:02.882 --> 23:07.084
Fraser fir. Okay, I want you to
cover some ground, so fan out.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.053
Go find a good tree.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.958
How do you know so much
about Christmas trees?

23:13.993 --> 23:16.093
My dad taught me.

23:16.129 --> 23:19.897
Steven, there's some
ornaments over here. Come look.

23:22.301 --> 23:23.768
- Duty calls.
- Yep.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.371
I'm gonna go look for
some trees over here.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.973
Okay, perfect.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.242
Hey, Gretchen,
what about this one?

23:31.277 --> 23:33.744
Okay, so this is nice,

23:33.780 --> 23:36.046
but do you see how at the bottom
it's already browning?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.248
You don't want that.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.716
Yeah.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.285
Well, we have
an artificial tree at home.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.720
We're kinda new at this.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.722
So how long have
you and my brother

23:44.757 --> 23:45.723
been seeing each other?

23:45.758 --> 23:47.425
Oh, no, we're not...

23:47.460 --> 23:50.261
No. I'm just the decorator.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.930
And I guess now also the
Christmas coordinator, so...

23:52.965 --> 23:54.999
We just met like three days ago.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.600
See? I told you.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.336
I was hoping he was
finally moving on.

23:59.372 --> 24:01.172
Moving on?

24:01.207 --> 24:03.274
He had his heart broken
a few years ago.

24:03.309 --> 24:06.110
That's when he really started
to bury himself in work, so...

24:06.145 --> 24:08.646
I was just hoping things
were finally changing.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.582
Ooh. What about this one?

24:11.617 --> 24:12.617
Gretchen, come here.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.502
That's really pretty.

24:34.073 --> 24:37.007
Thanks. I didn't know
anybody was listening.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.477
I didn't know you could sing.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.045
Only sometimes.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.046
You're really good.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.482
Thanks.

24:44.517 --> 24:46.016
What's wrong?

24:46.052 --> 24:48.986
I don't think my parents
would feel the same way.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.621
What makes you say that?

24:50.656 --> 24:52.990
My mom wants me to get
a volleyball scholarship,

24:53.025 --> 24:54.625
just like her,

24:54.660 --> 24:57.027
and my dad wants me to be
a doctor, just like him.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.497
They don't even know
I'm taking choir this semester.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.764
Please don't tell them.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.569
But you should tell them.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.049
You never know.
They might be into it.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.739
No. Can you imagine
what my dad would say

25:08.774 --> 25:12.710
if I said I wanted to be
a singer instead of a doctor?

25:12.745 --> 25:13.745
Right.

25:13.779 --> 25:16.413
Well, maybe ease him into it.

25:16.449 --> 25:19.550
My dad wanted me to be a lawyer
for the longest time.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.318
Really?

25:21.354 --> 25:25.489
Grandpa always talked about
how he hated being a lawyer.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.424
He wanted me
to take over his firm.

25:27.460 --> 25:31.328
Telling him that
I wanted to be an architect,

25:31.364 --> 25:35.866
well, it was
a pretty hard thing to do.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.535
But you know what?

25:37.570 --> 25:40.070
It all turned out okay
in the end.

25:42.408 --> 25:45.576
Hey, you know what else
we should do?

25:45.611 --> 25:47.244
Get hot chocolate.
You want some?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.647
- Yes, please.
- Okay, come on.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.519
- Guess what.
- What?

25:55.555 --> 25:58.455
Gretchen found the biggest,
fullest tree on the lot.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.457
It's gonna look beautiful
in your living room.

26:00.493 --> 26:02.293
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:02.328 --> 26:03.661
At least I think I did.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.131
Are we sure we want to do that?

26:07.166 --> 26:10.034
Don't you think we want to find
like a little scrawny tree

26:10.069 --> 26:11.402
that just needs a lot of love,

26:11.437 --> 26:13.370
and then we decorate him up
real big,

26:13.406 --> 26:16.540
so he feels good about himself?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.580
I mean...

26:22.615 --> 26:23.914
Or not.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.235
- Okay, so just move the tree...
- Right here?

26:33.259 --> 26:35.125
- A little to the right.
- To the right?

26:35.161 --> 26:37.962
- That'd be left.
- Wait, this is heavy.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.241
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!
- Right there?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.599
- Perfect!
- There we go.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.011
All right, just some lights
and ornaments,

26:43.035 --> 26:44.902
and this tree's
gonna come to life.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.270
All right, guys, good luck.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.939
Where are you going?

26:48.975 --> 26:51.008
I gotta finish my drawings.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.776
Gotta get work done
at some point, Mom.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.379
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.449
Okay.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.602
Why don't we put some lights
on the tree?

27:06.626 --> 27:08.158
- Come on!
- All right.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.705
- This is pretty.
- I'll get this untangled.

27:09.729 --> 27:10.928
Yeah.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.162
It's got tinsel in it.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.831
We'll untangle those.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.533
Thanks, Paige.

27:16.569 --> 27:19.370
Is there any room left
on the tree?

27:19.405 --> 27:21.705
There's always room.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.342
Look, here's another
box of ornaments.

27:25.378 --> 27:28.946
I have no idea
how you got star up there.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.514
That was amazing.

27:30.549 --> 27:34.852
Sweetheart,
that's very off-center.

27:36.722 --> 27:39.289
Well, you're welcome
to hang it yourself.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.824
This is way more fun.

27:44.930 --> 27:48.866
Why don't I just go help the
kids make some hot chocolate?

27:48.901 --> 27:51.702
Good idea.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.472
Men!

27:55.508 --> 27:58.075
I think you guys are cute.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.643
Should I put this in the center?

27:59.679 --> 28:01.045
Yeah.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.513
Let's see.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.748
How about right there?

28:04.784 --> 28:05.949
He was right.

28:07.286 --> 28:11.255
Yeah.

28:18.964 --> 28:21.231
It's beautiful.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.201
You guys really
knocked it out of the park.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.603
This looks great.

28:26.639 --> 28:28.105
It really does.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.339
It's wonderful.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.774
That's amazing.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.076
- I love it.
- Great.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.848
My living room
has never looked better.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.552
You guys did a fantastic job.

28:41.587 --> 28:44.054
It's perfect.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.589
Now it is.

28:45.624 --> 28:48.692
You guys, I'm gonna get going.
Good night.

28:48.728 --> 28:52.029
Today was really fun.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.697
Will you be coming back
tomorrow?

28:53.733 --> 28:56.433
Yes. I have work in the morning,
but the afternoon off,

28:56.469 --> 28:58.435
and I figured we would
go to my aunt's inn

28:58.471 --> 28:59.870
over in Silverpine.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.405
She's having
an apple cider party.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.918
The entire neighborhood
gets together,

29:02.942 --> 29:04.708
and they make
homemade spiced cider.

29:04.744 --> 29:05.876
It's amazing.

29:05.911 --> 29:06.977
That sounds fun.

29:07.012 --> 29:08.779
I'll walk you to your car.

29:08.814 --> 29:12.049
Thank you. Bye.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.552
Bye.

29:17.456 --> 29:21.425
So I take it you are not
gonna be joining us

29:21.460 --> 29:23.327
at the inn tomorrow?

29:23.362 --> 29:25.863
Can't. Too much to do.

29:28.134 --> 29:31.502
All right.
Well, have a good night.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.903
Yeah, you too.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.039
I just... Yeah.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.087
- Thanks.
- Let me get that. There you go.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.244
Well, thank you.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.146
Service here, you know?

29:42.181 --> 29:43.413
Such a gentleman.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.949
Thank you.

29:45.985 --> 29:46.985
- Bye.
- Have a good one.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.090
That's not good.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.925
I have an idea.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.761
Just as I suspected.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.697
It's your alternator.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.699
My sister, ladies and gentlemen,

30:02.735 --> 30:04.468
the best mechanic in the family.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.937
I restore old cars
in my spare time.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.472
That's impressive.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.285
What can I say?
We're a family of overachievers.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.676
I could probably fix it
by tomorrow.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.478
That would be great.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.280
Do you want me
to give you a ride home?

30:16.315 --> 30:20.050
Yes, but I have a lot
of supplies in my trunk.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.952
I don't mind.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.555
Okay.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.224
Thanks.

30:41.674 --> 30:45.108
You can just set it
on the counter.

30:47.112 --> 30:48.212
Thank you.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.746
This is your apartment?

30:49.782 --> 30:52.216
Yeah, this is it.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.685
I just assumed I'd be
walking into something

30:54.720 --> 30:56.720
that looked like
Santa's workshop.

30:56.755 --> 30:59.523
I know. I pull out
my decorations every year,

30:59.558 --> 31:02.926
but between my day job and
trying to start this business,

31:02.962 --> 31:04.595
I never really get around to it.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.164
What?

31:07.199 --> 31:09.499
It's just...

31:09.535 --> 31:12.436
I guess we're more alike
than I thought.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.004
We both work too much.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.273
Thank you for giving me a ride

31:16.308 --> 31:18.342
and bringing all this stuff in.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.543
Yeah, of course.

31:21.647 --> 31:22.679
Good night.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.214
Good night.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.755
Bye.

31:31.790 --> 31:32.856
Bye.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.713
Welcome to the Silverpine Inn!

31:56.749 --> 31:58.815
This place is lovely.

31:58.851 --> 32:01.952
Forget Steven's place.
Can we stay here?

32:01.987 --> 32:04.621
Kirsten, Paige, Ellen,
this is my Aunt Lindsay.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.957
- So good to meet you.
- You too.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.759
You have a wonderful niece.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.928
I like to think so.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.396
Car's right out front.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.597
- Good as new.
- Thank you.

32:13.632 --> 32:17.000
I cannot believe
she fixed my car.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.802
You are very impressive.

32:18.837 --> 32:21.116
It was the least we could do
after all your help yesterday.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.308
Now, have any of you ever made
mold cider before?

32:26.845 --> 32:28.412
No.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.380
Well, you're in for a treat.

32:40.726 --> 32:44.594
Nice job, ladies.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.930
Keep in mind,
the finer you slice them,

32:46.966 --> 32:49.533
the easier it is
to mash them later.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.803
Paige, you figured out where you
want to apply to colleges yet?

32:52.838 --> 32:55.105
We're hoping she gets
a volleyball scholarship.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.540
You play volleyball?

32:56.575 --> 32:59.142
She is so good,
just like her mom at that age.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.678
Do you like it?

33:01.714 --> 33:04.314
Yeah, of course.

33:04.350 --> 33:07.684
See, I was not very coordinated
with sports in high school,

33:07.720 --> 33:09.164
but if it had to do
with creating something,

33:09.188 --> 33:11.989
like art class
or set design for a play,

33:12.024 --> 33:13.790
that's where I thrived.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.693
It's no wonder you became
a professional decorator.

33:16.729 --> 33:20.263
Well, not yet.
Maybe after a few more clients.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.800
Am I doing this right?

33:23.836 --> 33:25.402
That's perfect.
This is great.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.748
We can just throw them
in the bowl.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.905
That looks great.

33:28.941 --> 33:31.074
Pitch is confined.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.543
You'll be talking directly
with Davis Bowers.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.479
He's the CEO
of the investment firm.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.980
You feel ready?

33:37.016 --> 33:38.782
- I will be.
- Good.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.656
Going well?

33:46.692 --> 33:50.060
I've redrawn the layout
like ten times.

33:50.095 --> 33:53.330
You could use a break.
Step away.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.899
That always helps me
get a new perspective.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.234
You think so?

33:57.269 --> 33:59.269
Yeah. You didn't take lunch.

33:59.304 --> 34:00.771
You should take an early dinner.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.506
Okay.

34:02.541 --> 34:05.042
You're actually
taking my advice?

34:05.077 --> 34:07.844
Yeah.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.212
Yeah, I am.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.955
Feel free to use a few more
cinnamon sticks and cloves.

34:18.991 --> 34:21.391
The more spice,
the zestier the flavor.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.395
A few more, Mom, not the rest.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.763
Got it.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.431
That smells amazing.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.966
I call Paige's batch.

34:30.002 --> 34:33.270
- You came!
- I thought I'd take a break.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.938
That picture you sent me really
got me craving apple cider.

34:35.974 --> 34:38.775
I see how it is. Now that we've
done the labor and hard work,

34:38.811 --> 34:40.744
you show up for
some hot apple cider.

34:40.779 --> 34:41.844
It's a win-win.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.560
There you are.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.128
Sorry.

34:58.163 --> 35:01.064
I don't know if I'm allowed
to be back here.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.566
Is this you?

35:02.601 --> 35:04.768
I guess you could say
you've always been

35:04.803 --> 35:06.570
tangled up in Christmas.

35:06.605 --> 35:10.974
That was a terrible
Christmas pun.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.877
But yeah, yeah,
you could say that.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.750
Those your parents?

35:20.786 --> 35:23.453
They passed away
when I was younger.

35:25.624 --> 35:26.723
I'm sorry.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.463
The cider's delicious.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.732
Glad you got to taste it.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.535
Me too.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.537
Seems like they're
having fun out there.

35:40.572 --> 35:41.972
Oh, I knew they would.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.673
That's what Christmas
is all about.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.475
Apple cider parties?

35:45.511 --> 35:48.011
No! No, it's about getting
your family together

35:48.046 --> 35:49.046
and making memories.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.947
All the holiday decorating

35:50.983 --> 35:54.184
is just kind of what
brings us all together.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.952
Well, cheers to that.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.725
Who's that?

36:01.760 --> 36:04.294
Oh. Oh, that...

36:04.329 --> 36:08.331
That is my ex. I don't know
why my aunt still has that here.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.133
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

36:10.169 --> 36:13.470
It's okay.
He wasn't right for me.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.238
How so?

36:15.274 --> 36:19.342
Well, when I left my job
at a big corporation

36:19.378 --> 36:21.411
to start my holiday
decorating business,

36:21.446 --> 36:24.681
he thought I was frivolous.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.483
That's not good.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.753
No, no, I mean he just thought
that I had something good going,

36:29.788 --> 36:31.922
so why be silly and mess it up?

36:31.957 --> 36:35.392
Well, I have to say as
a client of your new business,

36:35.427 --> 36:37.727
he couldn't have been
more wrong.

36:37.763 --> 36:41.398
Well, I knew he wasn't ready for
me when he didn't believe in me.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.702
What about you?

36:45.737 --> 36:48.038
A few years back,

36:48.073 --> 36:50.774
I was gonna propose
to my long-term girlfriend,

36:50.809 --> 36:55.412
and I found out she was in love
with someone else.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.380
Sorry.

36:57.416 --> 37:01.251
After we broke up,

37:01.286 --> 37:04.287
I put all my energy
into my work,

37:04.323 --> 37:07.924
and I guess you could say
the silver lining is...

37:07.960 --> 37:10.727
I'm about to be made partner.

37:10.762 --> 37:15.298
You know, life has a funny way
of just working itself out.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.400
There you guys are.

37:17.436 --> 37:20.036
Jeff texted. He and Dad
are picking up some steaks.

37:20.072 --> 37:22.439
Gretchen, you must join us
for dinner tonight.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.441
Thank you. I...

37:24.476 --> 37:26.943
I actually have a few things
I have to get done though.

37:26.979 --> 37:28.144
I insist.

37:28.180 --> 37:30.380
So do I.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.449
Well, what can I bring?

37:32.484 --> 37:34.217
You.

37:36.822 --> 37:38.188
I will be there.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.762
So I come downstairs,

37:45.797 --> 37:49.766
and Steven has opened up
all of the Christmas presents.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.102
- Even the ones for the dog.
- What?

37:52.137 --> 37:54.237
Keep in mind, this was
the middle of the night.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.072
I had just gone to bed.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.474
I wake up with Kirsten

37:57.509 --> 37:59.743
screeching
at the top of her lungs,

37:59.778 --> 38:01.444
jump out of bed
to see what was wrong.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.947
We get downstairs,
and the place is covered

38:03.982 --> 38:05.882
in wrapping paper and ribbons,

38:05.917 --> 38:09.653
and Steven's just sitting there
playing with his new truck.

38:09.688 --> 38:12.922
Okay, guys, I was like five
when this happened, okay?

38:12.958 --> 38:15.058
I think you need to start
your story with that.

38:15.093 --> 38:18.261
It's not like
this was last year.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.507
I think Gretchen brought
some cookies,

38:19.531 --> 38:21.231
so I'm gonna go put them out.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.300
Actually, they're not just
any ordinary cookies.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.101
They're cookies
that need to be decorated.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.237
I figured we could have
some fun after dinner.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.139
Oh, yes!

38:29.174 --> 38:30.974
Yes, that sounds so fun.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.654
Okay, does anybody
have any questions?

38:32.678 --> 38:34.944
You have icing
all over your fingers.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.980
I love the green frosty gumdrop.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.448
Are these cinnamon?

38:38.483 --> 38:41.084
We are all gonna have
a sugar rush.

38:41.119 --> 38:42.852
We'll be asleep in ten minutes.

38:42.888 --> 38:45.021
I love your
Christmas tree cookie.

38:45.057 --> 38:47.624
Thank you. I like your...
What is...

38:47.659 --> 38:50.427
Reindeer. It's a reindeer.

38:50.462 --> 38:55.598
Well, it will make more sense
when you put a nose on them.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.300
Here.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.768
- See that?
- Yeah.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.837
- See?
- Whoa!

39:00.872 --> 39:03.340
You do not have
to squeeze that hard.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.376
I'm trying to make it like your
perfectly decorated cookies.

39:06.411 --> 39:09.112
Oh, you like my perfectly
decorated cookies?

39:09.147 --> 39:11.014
- They're great.
- Well, they took a long time

39:11.049 --> 39:12.615
to figure out how to make, so...

39:12.651 --> 39:14.484
- Yeah, I believe it.
- I'm kidding!

39:14.519 --> 39:16.720
It's real easy. Come here.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.955
Okay, I just hold it
a little lower

39:18.990 --> 39:22.525
and squeeze it
and go in a circle, yeah.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.794
You're not even looking. Look!

39:41.079 --> 39:45.215
Guys, these cookies aren't gonna
decorate themselves. Come on.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.420
You actually have some
on your face.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.856
- There we go.
- Look.

39:52.891 --> 39:57.260
- It's me as a snowman.
- It's a happy Christmas.

39:57.295 --> 39:59.028
I think you like him.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.231
What? No!

40:01.266 --> 40:03.533
No. He's just a client.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.901
He likes my decorating skills,

40:04.936 --> 40:06.376
and I'm helping
coordinate Christmas.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.837
It's business.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.406
You haven't stopped
talking about him

40:09.441 --> 40:11.408
or his family for the last hour.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.076
He's more than just a client.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.779
Okay, but it's not like that.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.448
We have an arrangement.
I'm helping him with Christmas,

40:18.483 --> 40:19.927
and he's gonna help me
land new clients.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.184
It's perfect.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.453
But you think he's cute.

40:23.488 --> 40:25.422
I'm leaving.

40:27.159 --> 40:29.237
The place will have
a completely modern feel,

40:29.261 --> 40:31.461
lots of glass
and smooth surfaces,

40:31.496 --> 40:33.096
concrete all around.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.934
No. I don't think that's it.

40:37.969 --> 40:41.271
I'm sorry. What...
What's not it?

40:41.306 --> 40:44.607
I like it, but no.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.277
Now, if my company's
going to invest in this,

40:47.312 --> 40:51.614
it needs to be...
different.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.651
Is there a certain part of it
that you don't like?

40:54.686 --> 40:57.053
All of it.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.788
But you just said
you liked some of it.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.958
Yes. It's one of those things
that's difficult

41:01.993 --> 41:04.961
for me to describe
exactly what we want.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.663
I just know it's not this.

41:06.698 --> 41:11.000
All right. I will come up
with some new plans

41:11.036 --> 41:12.502
and give you some more options.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.270
We have another meeting
across town,

41:14.306 --> 41:16.940
so save those ideas
for another day.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.275
- No problem.
- How about we set up a meeting

41:19.311 --> 41:20.510
for day after tomorrow?

41:20.545 --> 41:22.011
Steven can draw up
some more plans,

41:22.047 --> 41:24.280
and hopefully it'll be something

41:24.316 --> 41:26.649
more in the area of
what you guys had in mind.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.785
I am a fan of your work.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.186
I know we're
in the right ballpark.

41:30.222 --> 41:32.155
Teaming up with
the Geyser Corporation

41:32.190 --> 41:33.957
means a lot.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.826
I just want to make sure we
do it right before we invest.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.495
I won't let you down.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.164
Okay. Talk then.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.466
Thank you.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.476
Well, that could've gone better.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.845
I still don't know what it is
that he wants.

41:55.881 --> 41:57.313
I know it's frustrating.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.015
They only know
what they don't want.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.728
I should've had some
backup plans ready to go.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.185
No, it's fine.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.987
Just go back
to the drawing board.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.555
You'll figure it out.

42:05.590 --> 42:08.625
You always find a way.

42:34.386 --> 42:37.220
They always find
the best of the best to sing.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.489
People come from all over
to hear.

42:39.524 --> 42:41.925
I love this street.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.594
Steven, why haven't you
taken us here before?

42:44.629 --> 42:46.062
I didn't know about it.

42:47.532 --> 42:50.066
Now let's have some of you
join us.

42:51.803 --> 42:53.436
Paige.

42:56.641 --> 42:58.074
Sing.

42:58.109 --> 42:59.742
Come on, you got this.

43:45.490 --> 43:46.789
That's my niece!

43:46.825 --> 43:48.057
That's my daughter!

43:49.761 --> 43:51.127
That's my niece right there!

44:03.108 --> 44:06.075
I had no idea that you could
sing like that.

44:06.111 --> 44:08.144
You have a beautiful voice.

44:08.179 --> 44:09.912
Clearly you did not
get that from me.

44:09.948 --> 44:11.648
No, she probably got it from me.

44:11.683 --> 44:13.916
I'm not so sure about that.

44:13.952 --> 44:16.653
Really, Paige,
you have an amazing voice.

44:16.688 --> 44:18.087
You have to join a choir.

44:18.123 --> 44:21.257
- I joined the school choir.
- Really?

44:21.292 --> 44:23.860
The more electives you have
on your application, the better.

44:23.895 --> 44:26.195
Volleyball and choir?

44:26.231 --> 44:29.832
Look out, Yale.
Here comes Paige!

44:29.868 --> 44:31.000
Thanks.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.881
It was a beautiful evening.

44:44.916 --> 44:46.249
Yeah.

44:46.284 --> 44:47.884
Weren't the carolers wonderful?

44:47.919 --> 44:49.419
They sure were.

44:49.454 --> 44:51.487
And they get better and better
every year.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.222
- Do they?
- Must take a lot of practice

44:53.258 --> 44:55.358
to do that
without any instruments.

44:55.393 --> 44:58.594
Some of their harmonies
were really spot on.

44:58.630 --> 45:00.007
We have carolers
in the mall at home.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.031
Paige.

45:02.734 --> 45:05.068
Hey, is everything okay?

45:05.103 --> 45:07.737
- Kind of.
- What's going on?

45:07.772 --> 45:10.907
I've been missing volleyball
practice to be in choir.

45:10.942 --> 45:12.875
I don't know how to tell them.

45:12.911 --> 45:14.877
You know,
I know what it feels like

45:14.913 --> 45:16.524
to be doing something
you don't want to do,

45:16.548 --> 45:18.381
wishing you were
doing something else.

45:18.416 --> 45:20.116
You know how my dad is.

45:20.151 --> 45:22.585
Can you imagine if he knew that
I wanted to major in music?

45:22.620 --> 45:26.122
He'd be so disappointed.
What do you think I should do?

45:26.157 --> 45:28.357
Well, he's gonna find out
sooner or later,

45:28.393 --> 45:29.804
so wouldn't you rather
it came from you?

45:29.828 --> 45:32.061
I just hate letting him down.

45:32.097 --> 45:34.397
It's hard, I know,
to take that leap

45:34.432 --> 45:36.299
because there's always risk.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.568
I took one when I left
my corporate job

45:38.603 --> 45:40.737
to start the holiday
decorating business,

45:40.772 --> 45:43.740
and I ended up taking
a part-time job as a safety net,

45:43.775 --> 45:45.475
and it's just been
a distraction.

45:45.510 --> 45:47.643
I've had a really hard time
committing to my dream.

45:47.679 --> 45:49.779
Why haven't you?

45:49.814 --> 45:55.151
Honestly? 'Cause I've been
scared like you.

45:55.186 --> 45:58.488
Who would you be letting down?

45:58.523 --> 46:01.257
Myself.

46:01.292 --> 46:04.026
I guess we both need courage.

46:05.997 --> 46:07.630
I am so glad there's not
a legal limit

46:07.665 --> 46:08.909
to the amount of cookies
you can eat

46:08.933 --> 46:10.433
because these are amazing.

46:10.468 --> 46:11.934
How many have you had?

46:11.970 --> 46:13.903
This is my fourth.

46:13.938 --> 46:16.205
I'm cutting you off.

46:18.309 --> 46:19.375
Hey!

46:22.781 --> 46:24.580
Thank you.

46:27.719 --> 46:29.585
I heard you talking
to Paige earlier.

46:29.621 --> 46:32.021
I shouldn't have eavesdropped.

46:32.056 --> 46:35.191
- She's a really sweet kid.
- Is it true?

46:35.226 --> 46:36.993
You're afraid to quit your job
at the catalog

46:37.028 --> 46:40.329
to focus on Holidays
Made To Order full-time?

46:40.365 --> 46:44.033
I'm scared that if
I take that leap and fail,

46:44.068 --> 46:45.802
I'm just gonna be stuck.

46:48.039 --> 46:49.472
I'm afraid too.

46:49.507 --> 46:52.408
What are you afraid of?

46:54.813 --> 46:58.181
That the minute that I'm not
successful at my job,

46:58.216 --> 46:59.816
I won't have anything else.

46:59.851 --> 47:02.185
You'll always have your family.

47:02.220 --> 47:05.221
Yeah, I know,
but up until this Christmas,

47:05.256 --> 47:08.157
I've been kind of
pushing them aside.

47:08.193 --> 47:10.660
And now that I've been
spending more time with them,

47:10.695 --> 47:12.061
my work's suffering.

47:12.096 --> 47:14.130
It's like I can't win.

47:15.834 --> 47:18.234
I think you just need
to find a better balance.

47:18.269 --> 47:21.337
I need to be more like
you and Paige.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.973
Just focus on what I want
and go for it.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.408
You don't like
designing buildings?

47:25.443 --> 47:27.009
I do.

47:27.045 --> 47:32.048
See, when I was studying
to be an architect,

47:32.083 --> 47:35.084
my favorite classes were
designing homes for families,

47:35.119 --> 47:37.820
and that's what I thought I was
gonna do with my life.

47:37.856 --> 47:40.223
And then right out of college,

47:40.258 --> 47:42.692
Geyser offered me
this amazing position,

47:42.727 --> 47:45.261
and I took it.

47:45.296 --> 47:48.197
I kind of lost sight of
what I really wanted to do.

47:48.233 --> 47:50.399
What made you remember again?

47:52.737 --> 47:54.537
You.

48:01.079 --> 48:04.614
Steven, what did you do with the
rest of the roasted chestnuts?

48:04.649 --> 48:06.249
Paige has them.

48:07.819 --> 48:09.385
Paige?

48:09.420 --> 48:10.486
Okay.

48:12.490 --> 48:14.624
I am gonna get going.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.692
What's on the Christmas docket
for tomorrow?

48:16.728 --> 48:18.628
One of my favorite
holiday traditions.

48:18.663 --> 48:19.629
Which is?

48:19.664 --> 48:20.997
You'll see.

48:57.769 --> 48:58.834
Hello?

48:58.870 --> 49:00.269
<i>This is a bad time?</i>

49:00.305 --> 49:02.471
No, no.

49:02.507 --> 49:04.006
<i>What's up, Nolan?</i>

49:04.042 --> 49:05.574
Clients weren't happy
with the mock-ups

49:05.610 --> 49:07.109
you and Marie submitted.

49:07.145 --> 49:09.345
We just followed
the exact description

49:09.380 --> 49:10.913
the marketing department wanted.

49:10.949 --> 49:12.481
They changed their minds.

49:12.517 --> 49:14.984
<i>I need you to redo them soon.</i>

49:16.321 --> 49:18.621
Okay, I will get right on it.

49:18.656 --> 49:19.656
<i>Thanks.</i>

49:19.691 --> 49:21.157
Bye.

49:56.694 --> 49:58.160
Can't sleep?

49:58.196 --> 50:01.364
I'm making you hot chocolate
while you work.

50:08.773 --> 50:10.139
Thanks, Mom.

50:13.845 --> 50:16.679
You should be in bed.

50:16.714 --> 50:19.048
I know.
It's the price you pay

50:19.083 --> 50:21.350
for staying out and about
all evening.

50:23.121 --> 50:26.222
You know, it's funny.

50:26.257 --> 50:28.657
You didn't want to be a lawyer
like your dad,

50:28.693 --> 50:31.394
but you're sure followed
in his footsteps

50:31.429 --> 50:33.996
when I came to work ethic.

50:34.032 --> 50:35.064
Thanks.

50:35.099 --> 50:37.533
It wasn't a compliment.

50:37.568 --> 50:39.035
Right.

50:41.039 --> 50:44.440
I'm just so glad
that we came here this year.

50:44.475 --> 50:49.412
It seems so long
since we've all been together.

50:49.447 --> 50:52.248
I'm glad too, Mom.

50:52.283 --> 50:55.184
And I think
it's thanks to Gretchen.

50:57.588 --> 51:01.290
Yeah, she is making Christmas
pretty special, isn't she?

51:01.325 --> 51:04.126
And after Christmas?

51:04.162 --> 51:07.029
Well, I'm hoping that my firm
will have her come on

51:07.065 --> 51:09.098
and decorate all the buildings
that we own.

51:09.133 --> 51:11.100
That way I can still see
more of her.

51:11.135 --> 51:14.770
Well, I know one sure way
you could see her again.

51:14.806 --> 51:17.206
What is it called?

51:17.241 --> 51:19.119
When you like someone,
you invite them to dinner

51:19.143 --> 51:20.810
to see where it goes?

51:20.845 --> 51:22.545
Oh, it's a date, Steven.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.413
It's called a date.

51:24.449 --> 51:26.749
I don't know.

51:26.784 --> 51:29.285
I feel kind of weird
asking her out, you know?

51:29.320 --> 51:33.155
I feel like I'd be taking
advantage of the situation.

51:33.191 --> 51:36.926
You know, I'm a client of hers,
I promised her clients.

51:36.961 --> 51:39.462
Did it occur to you
that she might like you

51:39.497 --> 51:42.965
and say yes because of that
and no other reason?

51:43.000 --> 51:44.633
She's professional.

51:48.806 --> 51:49.806
Steven...

51:52.777 --> 51:55.444
Just because
you were burned once

51:55.480 --> 51:59.882
doesn't mean that you can't
give love another shot.

52:02.887 --> 52:04.053
I know.

52:20.771 --> 52:21.771
Thank you.

52:21.806 --> 52:22.771
Hi.

52:22.807 --> 52:24.573
This place is great.

52:24.609 --> 52:26.642
I didn't even know this existed.

52:26.677 --> 52:29.578
What? My friend
volunteers all the time.

52:29.614 --> 52:31.280
Look.

52:31.315 --> 52:33.449
Neighborhood of Good.
It's a great place to find ways

52:33.484 --> 52:35.818
to give back to your community
all year.

52:35.853 --> 52:38.154
That's how I found out about
this Christmas toy drive.

52:38.189 --> 52:39.922
So basically
everyone in Silverpine

52:39.957 --> 52:41.557
can participate
in the collections,

52:41.592 --> 52:43.437
and today we are gonna
sort through all the toys

52:43.461 --> 52:45.261
to make sure they
go to the right place,

52:45.296 --> 52:47.329
and then no kid in need
is left out.

52:47.365 --> 52:48.964
What a great idea.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.444
Should we check out the tables?
Come on.

52:50.468 --> 52:51.767
Yeah, come on, sweetheart.

53:01.612 --> 53:04.647
So technically, this should go
in the 10-to-12 pile,

53:04.682 --> 53:07.016
but I would totally
play with this.

53:07.051 --> 53:09.451
So should I put it
in the any-age pile?

53:09.487 --> 53:11.320
I would stick with
the recommended age,

53:11.355 --> 53:13.822
but if Kirsten needs
a last-minute gift for you,

53:13.858 --> 53:15.024
I will let her know.

53:15.059 --> 53:16.059
Please do.

53:19.630 --> 53:21.163
I keep thinking about
all the kids

53:21.199 --> 53:24.200
that are gonna open these toys
Christmas morning,

53:24.235 --> 53:27.303
how excited they'll be,

53:27.338 --> 53:29.505
how just a simple act
of kindness

53:29.540 --> 53:32.474
can change a person's life
for the better, you know?

53:35.246 --> 53:38.714
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

53:38.749 --> 53:41.150
Thank you.

53:41.185 --> 53:42.618
You're welcome.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.320
Would you guys like
some hot chocolate?

53:44.355 --> 53:45.688
One of the perks
of volunteering.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.856
Yes, thank you.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.492
Well, this day gets better
and better. Thank you.

53:50.528 --> 53:52.027
You're welcome.
Merry Christmas.

53:52.063 --> 53:53.829
Merry Christmas.

53:53.864 --> 53:55.097
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

53:57.068 --> 53:58.701
Agreed.

53:58.736 --> 54:01.337
There is so much to do
in Silverpine.

54:01.372 --> 54:02.972
Well, there's a beautiful
gazebo outside,

54:03.007 --> 54:04.473
if you want to go for a walk.

54:04.508 --> 54:06.542
Yeah. I could use
the fresh air.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.644
Yeah, sounds like a great idea.
I'll come with.

54:08.679 --> 54:11.480
Actually, Jeff, let's go
check out the cupcake stand.

54:11.515 --> 54:13.249
You guys go on ahead.

54:13.284 --> 54:15.117
Sure.

54:16.887 --> 54:19.355
Gretchen, wanna go for a walk?

54:19.390 --> 54:21.056
Yeah, let's go.

54:29.367 --> 54:31.333
And here we are again,

54:31.369 --> 54:33.502
you getting me
to do something fun

54:33.537 --> 54:35.537
and slow down outside of work.

54:35.573 --> 54:37.084
You better be careful.
You're gonna get addicted

54:37.108 --> 54:40.175
to this nice work/life balance.

54:40.211 --> 54:42.745
I think I might.

54:42.780 --> 54:44.246
I love it out here.

54:44.282 --> 54:45.926
I used to come here all the time
with my family

54:45.950 --> 54:47.082
when I was younger.

54:47.118 --> 54:48.917
My parents would take me out,

54:48.953 --> 54:50.931
and there's actually a little
pond a little further out.

54:50.955 --> 54:52.554
My dad and I would go fishing.

54:52.590 --> 54:54.123
He grew up in Silverpine?

54:54.158 --> 54:55.924
My parents were both born here.

54:55.960 --> 54:59.728
But after they passed away,
I moved in with my Aunt Lindsay.

54:59.764 --> 55:02.464
That must have been tough.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.033
It was,

55:04.068 --> 55:08.237
but it made me appreciate
my aunt that much more.

55:10.007 --> 55:14.443
Actually, I used to have a
really hard time with Christmas.

55:14.478 --> 55:16.111
But my aunt was amazing,

55:16.147 --> 55:18.714
and she wanted to make it
enjoyable and fun,

55:18.749 --> 55:20.916
so she would plan
all these activities,

55:20.951 --> 55:24.153
and we would decorate
and whatever she could do

55:24.188 --> 55:28.724
to bring that excitement
to Christmas again for me.

55:28.759 --> 55:30.559
Well, I'm glad she did,

55:30.594 --> 55:32.428
so that way you could
share with us.

55:32.463 --> 55:36.231
I have loved spending
the holiday with your family.

55:36.267 --> 55:38.334
They're really amazing.

55:38.369 --> 55:42.838
I forgot how good it feels
to be around them, you know?

55:42.873 --> 55:45.107
You're really lucky.

55:45.142 --> 55:46.375
You know that, right?

55:47.778 --> 55:49.044
I do.

55:51.449 --> 55:53.649
I just need to be reminded
of that sometimes.

55:57.955 --> 56:00.289
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

56:06.464 --> 56:09.631
- "Believe."
- Did you do this?

56:09.667 --> 56:11.600
That was actually here
when I was younger.

56:11.635 --> 56:13.302
I don't know who wrote it,

56:13.337 --> 56:16.505
but I've always wondered
what they meant by "believe."

56:16.540 --> 56:21.009
Maybe that means whatever
the person needs it to mean.

56:23.247 --> 56:24.346
I like that.

57:05.589 --> 57:07.356
Hey, you're here!

57:07.391 --> 57:09.558
Hey.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.326
What's going on here?

57:11.362 --> 57:12.928
We're making stockings.

57:12.963 --> 57:16.031
It was the only thing missing
in your living room.

57:16.066 --> 57:17.711
Why didn't you let me know?
I would've stopped and got some.

57:17.735 --> 57:19.368
Where's the fun in that?

57:19.403 --> 57:21.181
It has a lot more meaning
if you make them yourself.

57:21.205 --> 57:23.906
Yeah, and I'm sewing names
on them.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.474
You gonna join us?

57:28.145 --> 57:29.645
Of course.

57:33.651 --> 57:35.684
- Use this one.
- Okay.

57:35.719 --> 57:37.519
- Here you go.
- All right.

57:37.555 --> 57:40.856
- Okay, trace that.
- Trace this?

57:40.891 --> 57:43.358
- Trace the boot.
- The boot.

57:43.394 --> 57:44.460
Trace the stocking.

57:44.495 --> 57:45.794
- All right.
- There we go.

57:45.830 --> 57:47.463
I'm an architect, so...

57:47.498 --> 57:49.264
- Pretty good at drawing.
- Good job.

57:49.300 --> 57:51.967
I've got some great news.

57:52.002 --> 57:53.902
I just spoke
to a colleague of mine

57:53.938 --> 57:55.215
who teaches at
Yale medical school,

57:55.239 --> 57:56.805
and he's invited Paige

57:56.841 --> 57:59.641
to join the high school
summer pre-med program.

57:59.677 --> 58:01.043
- What?
- I know!

58:01.078 --> 58:02.778
It's an incredible opportunity!

58:02.813 --> 58:04.658
Any school that sees that
on your college application?

58:04.682 --> 58:06.281
Shoo-in.

58:06.317 --> 58:09.451
Thanks. That's really
cool of you, Dad.

58:09.487 --> 58:11.553
It's a great program.
It's very hands-on.

58:11.589 --> 58:13.922
Does Paige even want to go?

58:13.958 --> 58:16.058
Of course she does,
right, honey?

58:21.031 --> 58:23.732
I wanted to spend this next
summer focusing on my music.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.903
Well, there's no reason
you can't work on your music

58:27.938 --> 58:29.671
and do the program too.

58:29.707 --> 58:33.075
I was thinking I could apply
to some of the schools out here,

58:33.110 --> 58:34.943
maybe as a vocal major.

58:34.979 --> 58:36.812
What?

58:36.847 --> 58:39.248
I didn't know how to tell you.

58:39.283 --> 58:42.818
I switched out volleyball next
semester for advanced choir.

58:42.853 --> 58:45.754
I thought you loved volleyball.

58:45.789 --> 58:49.458
I did for a while.
It's just not as fun anymore.

58:49.493 --> 58:54.263
I thought you wanted to be
a doctor, just like me.

58:54.298 --> 58:56.698
I did, but I changed my mind,

58:56.734 --> 58:59.501
and I've never been as happy
as I am when I'm singing.

58:59.537 --> 59:02.938
Well...

59:02.973 --> 59:04.973
I think it's wonderful.

59:07.411 --> 59:09.478
You have a beautiful voice,

59:09.513 --> 59:13.882
and you are capable of doing
anything you set your mind to.

59:13.918 --> 59:15.717
Thank you, Grandma.

59:15.753 --> 59:19.354
I don't know what to say.

59:19.390 --> 59:22.291
I should've told you sooner.

59:22.326 --> 59:24.626
I just didn't want
to let either of you down.

59:26.230 --> 59:29.131
You can never let us down.

59:29.166 --> 59:30.832
Honey, we love you
no matter what.

59:30.868 --> 59:32.668
We just want you to be happy.

59:32.703 --> 59:34.303
I'm just sorry
I ever made you feel

59:34.338 --> 59:37.005
like you couldn't tell us
something like this.

59:38.342 --> 59:39.508
Steven, stop!

59:39.543 --> 59:41.977
You're gettinglueverywhere!

59:42.012 --> 59:43.345
Sorry.

59:43.380 --> 59:46.081
I'm also very proud of you.

59:46.116 --> 59:49.685
You're done with the stocking.

59:49.720 --> 59:52.821
This one is mine,

59:52.856 --> 59:56.658
and this one is
your grandfather's, Ben.

59:59.530 --> 01:00:03.198
And this one's for me,

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:05.267
and one for your father.

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.637
Here's mine.

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:13.575
And don't forget about me.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:16.645
And this is an extra hook.
I must have miscounted.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.415
No, no, no, I put that there.

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.551
This is for you.

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:25.754
You guys made me one?

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:27.889
You were our Christmas coach
all week long.

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:31.093
Of course
we're gonna make you one.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.661
Thank you.

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:36.665
This was really cool.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.834
They really liked that.
Thank you.

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:40.869
You should do this every year.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:08.864
Hey.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:10.766
Just wanted to say good night.

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:12.868
I'm proud of you
for telling your parents.

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:15.137
Thanks. I don't think
I could've done it though

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:16.872
without Gretchen.

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:19.107
She really helped give me
the confidence.

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:22.678
Yeah. She's pretty great, huh?

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:27.582
I want to do something for her.

01:01:27.618 --> 01:01:29.451
I just don't know what.

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:31.953
I feel like the stocking
wasn't enough.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:33.422
I agree.

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:38.560
Actually, I have an idea.

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:46.568
Here they are.

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:48.270
Thank you so much.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:49.438
No, thank you.

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:50.772
This is a terrific idea.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:52.074
If it wasn't for this place,

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:53.909
I would've done it
a long time ago.

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:56.311
- We'll do a good job.
- I have it on good authority

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:59.114
that she'll be busy at work
most the day, so go crazy.

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:00.149
We will.

01:02:00.184 --> 01:02:02.084
All right. See ya.

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:15.197
She's gonna love this.

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.598
She is gonna love it.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:31.179
Okay.

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:37.853
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:07.582
Hey, great work on those photos.

01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:09.851
Thank you. I just looked at
what they liked last year

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:11.353
and did the same.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:14.289
Smart. That's very smart.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:19.828
Hey, guess what I overheard
this morning in the break room.

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:21.730
- What?
- Nolan's gonna offer you

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:24.699
a full-time position
after the holidays.

01:03:24.735 --> 01:03:25.735
Really?

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:27.435
Shh. Yes.

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:28.915
He was telling
the guy from accounting.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:31.106
What am I supposed
to say to him?

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.341
You tell them
that you'll gladly accept.

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:36.344
Well, if I accept, I'm not gonna
be able to have time to focus

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.180
on Holidays Made To Order.

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:40.215
You can still keep
your decorating business.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.449
Just keep it as a hobby.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:42.729
Steven said he was gonna
talk to his boss

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:44.286
about decorating
for his company.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.899
What's that saying about
birds in your hands

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:47.856
are better than
birds in the tree?

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:49.691
That's not it at all.

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:52.093
What I'm saying is
you should be happy.

01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:54.029
- This is a good thing.
- I am happy.

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:55.697
We should get drinks later
to celebrate.

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:57.065
Oh, I can't.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.867
Plans with your adopted family?

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:00.435
They're not my adopted family.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:02.237
Maybe someday.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.338
Okay.

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.800
What do you think?
Little much?

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:34.970
You guys did this for me?

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:38.573
Well, Paige wanted to do
something nice for you,

01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:41.910
and the fact that someone
so into Christmas

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:43.778
didn't even have
their house decorated,

01:04:43.814 --> 01:04:48.116
well, that's been haunting me
for days, so yeah.

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:53.488
Paige, thank you so much!

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:57.325
And, Steven, I-I love it!

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:58.760
You helped give me the courage

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:01.863
to tell my parents
what I really wanted.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:05.333
And I admire you
for following your dream.

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:08.803
And you! Who are you?

01:05:08.839 --> 01:05:11.640
You are so different from
the person that I first met.

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:14.276
Right? Who was that guy
in the building lobby

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:16.378
who wasn't into Christmas?

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:17.879
What a weirdo.

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:19.281
Totally!

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.626
I love Christmas movies.

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:33.995
Me too. Reminds me
of why I love Christmas.

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:47.309
That was such a good idea,
Gretchen.

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:49.210
I think Dad teared up
a little bit

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:51.012
I had something in my eye.

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:54.649
Well, I loved the movie.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:57.719
They always play the best movies
at Christmastime.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.321
So where to next?

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:01.423
Well, there's an amazing diner
down the street,

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.258
and they have incredible pie,

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:04.926
so I figure we'd get
some dessert.

01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:06.594
Yes, please.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:11.232
Lead the way.

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:14.102
Instead of using a simple grid
to line each of our buildings,

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:18.673
all of our shops and restaurants
will be lined in a circle,

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:21.309
all facing a center grass area,

01:06:21.345 --> 01:06:24.145
where a giant gazebo will be.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:28.583
In the summer,
there'll be live concerts.

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:32.620
In the winter, it'll be turned
into a seasonal wonderland.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.927
I love it.

01:06:38.962 --> 01:06:41.963
I do. What made you go
in this direction?

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:46.434
Well, I realized that...

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:51.806
the whole point of building this
is to bring people together.

01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:56.444
It's not just shops
and buildings.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.580
It's part of a community.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.918
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:07.288
Well, it's settled.

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:10.392
We want the Geyser Corporation
to build a shopping center.

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:12.327
Thank you so much.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.496
We're so happy that you like it.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.831
Well, we'll talk more details
after Christmas.

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.833
Yes, and I look forward to it.

01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:20.368
Great.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.705
Nicely done.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.574
Yes!

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:29.177
Hey, I was surprised
this past week when I came by

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.813
and didn't see you slumped over
your desk early in the morning.

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:34.816
But whatever you were doing,
it worked.

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:36.951
I'm gonna go and put a call in
to the board.

01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:42.157
Now, I wonder what inspired you

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:45.026
to go in a more
sentimental direction.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:47.829
I'll be back.

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:52.767
Rachel?

01:07:52.803 --> 01:07:54.069
Yes.

01:07:54.104 --> 01:07:55.236
Do you have a minute?

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:57.038
For you? Of course.

01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:59.908
I was wondering if you'd meet
with a friend of mine.

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:03.878
She's a holiday decorator,
and she does great work,

01:08:03.914 --> 01:08:07.582
and I wanted to see if maybe
we could bring her on

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:11.753
as the official decorator
for all the Geyser buildings.

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:13.221
We usually let someone

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:16.091
from the furnishings department
handle that,

01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:18.393
but that might be a good idea.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:20.462
I'll meet with her tomorrow,
if you want.

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:21.763
Yeah, thank you.

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:23.398
No, thank you.

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:26.100
This is how a partner thinks.

01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:33.252
All right, do you have the hat?

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.710
Do we want to go center
or to the side?

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:37.879
- Let's center it.
- To the side.

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:39.913
And...

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:42.550
Oh, my God, he's so cute!

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:44.285
What's his name?

01:08:44.321 --> 01:08:45.787
Charlie.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:47.087
Hey!

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:49.057
You look like your pitch
went well.

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.125
I landed the account.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.227
- Yes!
- Congratulations!

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.229
And I think
I might have made partner.

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:57.499
It gets better.
There's more.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.901
My boss wants to meet with
Gretchen tomorrow to discuss

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:03.304
being the official decorator
for all of our buildings.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.772
She wants to meet with me?

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:07.008
Yup. I hope you're
available tomorrow.

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:11.112
I am now! Thank you!

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:13.982
I just feel like I have to
go home and start prepping.

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:17.385
Just be yourself.
You'll do great.

01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:21.256
This is the one I did
for the Fourth of July.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:23.457
There are a lot of variations
of the flag,

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.937
but this is probably
one of my favorites.

01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:26.794
It's Halloween at my aunt's inn.

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.696
Very unique.

01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:29.930
Thank you.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:31.599
That's why I started my company.

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:34.135
I just feel like no two displays
should be alike.

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:36.337
Each one should have
their own special feel.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:37.639
I can see that.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.040
And even if it's the same theme,

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:40.707
like a Nutcracker Christmas,

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.277
I like to style it
to the building

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:44.045
or home that surrounds it.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.381
You're very talented.
There's no doubt about that.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:48.783
- Thank you.
- But for what we need,

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:51.019
you wouldn't have to worry
about making each display

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.787
different or unique.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:55.823
What connects our properties
is familiarity.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:58.193
Don't you think each property
should be decorated

01:09:58.228 --> 01:10:01.062
to echo what makes it special?

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:04.532
The Geyser Corporation
prides itself on consistency.

01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:06.167
You have a good eye.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:08.369
You'd work wonders
for our brand.

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:10.538
We'd love to have you
come work for us.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:13.875
See, I was hoping this was more
of a contractual-type thing,

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:15.910
where you would hire
Holidays Made To Order,

01:10:15.946 --> 01:10:19.414
and we would come in and set up
your displays individually,

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:21.182
for each building.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:24.219
But if you come to work for us
as an in-house decorator,

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:26.888
you wouldn't need
Holidays Made To Order.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.498
Thank you so much
for this opportunity

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:39.367
and for even offering me this.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:42.003
It's just...

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:43.738
I don't think
this is what I want.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.640
You sure?

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:50.345
Yeah.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.514
If you change your mind,
give me a call.

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:56.451
Thank you.

01:10:56.486 --> 01:10:58.620
It was very nice meeting you.

01:10:58.655 --> 01:11:00.388
You too.

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:05.326
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:11:12.168 --> 01:11:14.435
Let me call you back.

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.037
How'd it go?

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:17.205
Is she still here?

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.973
No. She left.

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:21.709
After I explained to her
how I saw the position,

01:11:21.745 --> 01:11:23.578
she didn't seem interested.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.580
Really?

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.148
Yeah.

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:29.150
It's a shame.
She's very talented.

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:31.419
I guess it just wasn't
the right fit for her.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:47.902
Gretchen, wait.

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:50.672
What happened?

01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:52.573
Rachel just said
you didn't want the job.

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:55.977
Yeah.
No, not that job.

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:58.279
I don't understand.
It sounded like a sure thing.

01:11:58.315 --> 01:12:02.116
Honestly, I wouldn't be
the one calling the shots.

01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:03.751
I would be another employee
at Geyser,

01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:05.520
just being told what to do.

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:07.033
It's really hard
to start your own company.

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:09.290
Some people don't even make it.

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:11.592
Are you saying that you
don't think I'll make it?

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:13.328
No. It's just, you know,

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:15.630
there's the way
we dream things should be

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:18.132
and the way they actually are.

01:12:18.168 --> 01:12:20.968
Is that why you're
still at your job?

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:23.438
What does that mean?

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:25.340
Well, your dream
is to go build houses,

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:27.342
but here you are
about to be partner,

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:28.954
doing something
you don't even want to do,

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:31.512
at a job that's
taken over your life.

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:33.614
I mean, at least
I believe in myself enough

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:35.883
to just pursue my dreams.

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:38.019
You know what? I don't want
to argue with you, okay?

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.154
I just...

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.690
I wanted to know why you didn't
take the job, that's all.

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:44.292
I'm really thankful.

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:45.793
Thank you so much
for that meeting.

01:12:45.829 --> 01:12:49.397
But it's just not for me.

01:12:49.432 --> 01:12:51.132
Let me double your pay then.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:53.668
What?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.303
For your services.

01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:59.040
I didn't keep up my end
of the bargain, and so...

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:01.209
I feel bad.

01:13:01.244 --> 01:13:03.811
No, you don't...
You don't have to do that.

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:05.046
No, it's least I could do.

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:06.681
I mean, you did great work.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.150
Is that what this is?

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:11.252
You're the client,
and I'm the employee?

01:13:11.287 --> 01:13:13.821
That's what we agreed to, right?

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:19.660
Yeah.

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:23.664
I will send you an invoice.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.636
Gretchen, wait!

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:36.411
So he just treated you
like an employee.

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:39.347
Yeah, like that was
all I was to him.

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:44.118
I can't believe I ever thought
that it was anything more.

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:46.187
You both got along so well.

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:50.091
I, for one, thought
there was more to it.

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:53.060
I thought he understood
the vision I had for my company,

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:55.530
and I thought
that he believed in me.

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:56.898
How do you know he doesn't?

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.900
You should have seen
how he reacted

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.035
when I told him
I wasn't taking the job.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.905
Maybe he was just hoping
to work with you more.

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.776
I don't know.

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:12.480
I realized that I put
a lot of expectation

01:14:12.515 --> 01:14:14.582
on the deal that we made,

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:18.386
and I thought that was gonna be
the key to my company's success.

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:21.656
Maybe the whole point
of all of this

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:25.626
is that you need to make things
happen for yourself.

01:14:25.662 --> 01:14:28.596
Take a leap.
Quit the catalog job.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:31.232
With no backup?

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:32.667
That's what I did.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.402
And with all my newfound
time and energy,

01:14:34.437 --> 01:14:37.071
I was finally able
to focus on the inn.

01:14:37.106 --> 01:14:39.774
- That is scary.
- I know.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:42.944
But some of the best things
in life are.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:46.914
Know that it'll all work out
the way it's supposed to.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.461
And think about
how much time you'd have

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:50.918
to completely focus
on getting new clients.

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:54.455
I want that. I really do.

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:58.426
Then give yourself
a Christmas present this year.

01:14:58.461 --> 01:15:01.128
Believe in yourself.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:14.609
Hey, honey, you're home early.

01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:19.614
Is Gretchen with you?

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:21.516
I wanted to go over some ideas

01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:23.684
about Christmas Eve dinner
tomorrow night.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.621
- No, she's not with me.
- Call her over then.

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:28.167
She mentioned something about
a skating rink nearby

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:30.825
that I wanted to check out.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:34.161
I don't know if Gretchen's
gonna be around anymore.

01:15:35.498 --> 01:15:37.031
We kinda had a fight.

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:40.501
What happened?

01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:43.471
She wasn't interested in this
job that Rachel was suggesting.

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:45.573
It wasn't what
she thought it'd be.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:48.175
I tried to encourage her,
but I think I messed it all up.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.845
And then I offered to pay her
more to make up for it,

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.381
and she got upset with me.

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:55.716
Of course she did.

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:58.519
That probably made her feel
like this whole time

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:01.255
we've just been using her
for her services.

01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:02.990
It's what we agreed to
from the start.

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:06.227
But, son...

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:08.663
it became so much more
than that.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:12.066
She became part of the family.

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:18.105
You're right.

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:20.575
And maybe you fell for her.

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.413
I did.

01:16:25.448 --> 01:16:26.714
Tell her.

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.449
And say what?

01:16:28.484 --> 01:16:31.519
Exactly how you feel.

01:16:33.122 --> 01:16:34.322
I will.

01:16:39.395 --> 01:16:42.029
- Gingerbread cookie?
- Cute.

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:44.065
- Have as many as you'd like.
- Thank you,

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.211
although I don't think any
amount of gingerbread cookies

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:47.702
is gonna make me feel good
right now.

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.971
No, but talking to him might.

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:51.939
- And say what?
- I don't know.

01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:54.275
How about, "Hey, Steven,
I'm falling for you."

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.921
Which is ridiculous
'cause I've only known him

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:57.244
for like two weeks.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.913
Then how about, "Hey, Steven,

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.082
let's be more than
client/decorator."

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.584
Gretchen, stack of orders
coming in for the new year.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.453
Thought you might want
to get a head start.

01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:08.456
Also, when you get back
from break, come see me.

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:12.360
There's something
we should discuss.

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:15.663
Actually, Nolan...

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:17.932
I am gonna give you
my two-weeks' notice.

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:20.301
- What?
- What?

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:22.681
I started a decorating business,
and I wanna give it a fair shot,

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:24.338
and the only way to do that

01:17:24.374 --> 01:17:26.907
is to really put the time
that it deserves into it.

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:32.780
Well, we'll miss you.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:35.116
You're a good worker
with a good eye.

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.519
Thank you. And...

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:41.222
if you ever need anybody
to decorate your office,

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:42.857
you just call me.

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:44.825
Yeah. Yeah, will do.

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:50.998
That was amazing!

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:52.733
That felt good.

01:17:52.769 --> 01:17:55.002
I mean, it was terrifying,
but it was... it was good.

01:17:55.038 --> 01:17:57.972
I'm so proud of you.
You finally just did it.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.841
Yeah, I did.

01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:12.219
Doing some last-minute cleaning
before Christmas?

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:15.222
No. I'm packing up my stuff.

01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:17.324
Ah, Rachel finally decided

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.260
to give you that
private office, did she?

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:22.897
No. Actually,
I'm telling her that I quit.

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:24.999
- What?
- Yeah.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:27.234
I don't think I like this job.

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:30.271
I don't like the hours,
I don't like the pressure,

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:33.507
I don't like that I lost myself
in it for so many years.

01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:35.176
What are you gonna do?

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:37.712
I think I'm gonna
go back to the reason

01:18:37.747 --> 01:18:41.048
I became an architect
in the first place.

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:44.218
I'm gonna design
single-family homes.

01:18:48.658 --> 01:18:52.927
I just don't understand why
we're setting so many plates.

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:56.731
Well, actually,
I'm expecting a few guests.

01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:57.898
Who?

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.202
There they are now.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.237
Why don't you bring 'em up?

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.880
Merry Christmas Eve!

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:16.484
What are you guys doing here?

01:19:16.519 --> 01:19:17.785
We couldn't imagine having

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.386
Christmas Eve dinner
without you.

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:20.988
We called to invite
you guys over,

01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:24.325
and Lindsay told us we should
all just come over here.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.994
I love seeing you guys.

01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:30.331
Well, I want you to know...
well, we all want you to know...

01:19:30.366 --> 01:19:33.000
how much we loved spending time
with you last week,

01:19:33.035 --> 01:19:36.937
and the entire family
agrees that, thanks to you,

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:39.273
this is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:41.108
That means so much to me.

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:43.978
I have loved every minute
with you guys.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:45.457
You're a part of our family,
Gretchen,

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:46.914
whether you like it or not.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.683
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

01:19:49.719 --> 01:19:51.296
Without you, my daughter
would've never had the courage

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.021
to tell me what she wanted
to do with her life.

01:19:54.056 --> 01:19:56.791
So can we celebrate over dinner?

01:19:56.826 --> 01:19:58.526
Oh, yes! Yes!

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:01.929
My aunt set up the big table,
so please go on upstairs.

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:04.832
Let's go. Come on, Ben.

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:06.267
So happy you came.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.269
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.503
Sorry I'm late.

01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:14.775
Hi.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.911
I had to get this out of my car.

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:20.047
What is this?

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:21.982
It's the company I'm starting.

01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.384
Building family homes.

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:25.186
I wanted you to be
the first to have it,

01:20:25.221 --> 01:20:28.522
since you're the one
that inspired me to do it.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.126
What about your firm?

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:34.195
I quit.

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:36.797
What?

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:39.200
I quit my job too.

01:20:39.235 --> 01:20:41.302
That's great.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.604
Now you can focus on
what you really want to do.

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:46.674
You too.

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:51.378
Who knows? Maybe someday
Holidays Made To Order

01:20:51.414 --> 01:20:55.416
can decorate some of the homes
that I build, you know?

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:57.985
I would really like that.

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:05.226
I should've told you
what you meant to me before.

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:07.394
I shouldn't have let you
walk away.

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:11.265
The truth is you're incredible.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:14.568
And working with you...

01:21:14.604 --> 01:21:18.739
spending time with you...

01:21:18.774 --> 01:21:21.876
just being with you
the last few weeks

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:24.011
has changed my life forever.

01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:27.581
Bumping into you in that lobby

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:30.417
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.
