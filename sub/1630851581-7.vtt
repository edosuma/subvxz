Here we are. With this new pot,
you're all dressed up

00:36.328 --> 00:38.956
to welcome the students today,
Geraldine!

00:40.499 --> 00:42.042
Woof!

00:57.307 --> 00:59.851
Hey, cool cactus, Mike!

00:59.851 --> 01:02.562
Thanks.
It's a pachycereus‐pringlei,

01:02.562 --> 01:03.981
a Mexican species that ‐‐

01:03.981 --> 01:07.943
Four... three... two... one...

01:07.943 --> 01:11.905
Yes! I'm on time,
which means I win our bet, sis!

01:13.115 --> 01:15.492
Congrats, but didn't
you forget something?

01:15.492 --> 01:16.660
(Gasps)

01:21.790 --> 01:24.543
Oh, no!
Our class on photosynthesis!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.421
‐ (Buzzing)
‐ Eugh!

01:31.466 --> 01:33.218
A plant! A plant!
Gotta find a plant!

01:34.511 --> 01:35.178
Oh, I know!

01:39.891 --> 01:41.643
(Groans) I don't know.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.981
‐ Hello?
‐ Hi, sweetie.

01:45.981 --> 01:49.192
Just wanted to make sure that...
Oh, Jay, nudge the projector

01:49.192 --> 01:51.903
a bit to the right...
er, that you remembered

01:51.903 --> 01:53.655
to take your plant this morning.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.199
Uh‐huh. Yep. Totes. Totally!

01:56.199 --> 01:59.828
<i>Excellent! I'm sure Professor</i>
<i>Pascal will be pleased.</i>

01:59.828 --> 02:02.664
<i>I really hope</i>
<i>you get a good grade for once!</i>

02:07.711 --> 02:10.255
Ooh, fascinating find, Rajat!

02:10.672 --> 02:15.552
I've never seen a hybrid amarant
up close before! You get an A+!

02:15.552 --> 02:16.261
Oh, yeah!

02:19.139 --> 02:21.850
I'm for sure getting a D, again.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.270
Huh?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.989
You're seriously gonna take
Prof Pascal's plant

02:35.989 --> 02:37.574
for your presentation?

02:37.574 --> 02:38.784
Relax,

02:39.242 --> 02:41.787
he won't even notice,
even with his glasses.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.414
Ooh!
A fantastic specimen, Drake!

02:45.624 --> 02:48.418
‐ But that's stealing.
‐ More like sneaky borrowing.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.587
Hold up, Andy.
This is not cool.

02:56.635 --> 02:57.594
Huh?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.974
‐ Phew!
‐ Geraldine!

03:02.974 --> 03:04.685
What are you doing on the floor?

03:07.604 --> 03:10.857
‐ Boo!
‐ Ghost!

03:11.858 --> 03:13.151
(Evil laugh)

03:15.320 --> 03:19.199
Everyone calmly
make your way to the fire exit.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.035
Phew!
That ghost saved my day!

03:23.829 --> 03:25.789
Ahem! Let's go, Ghost Force!

03:26.790 --> 03:29.126
<i>Ghost Force,</i>
<i>don't fear the glow!</i>

03:34.548 --> 03:35.841
Fury!

03:36.925 --> 03:38.093
Krush!

03:39.719 --> 03:40.929
Myst!

03:44.474 --> 03:45.600
Ghost Force!

03:49.062 --> 03:51.022
‐ Aaah!
‐ Oh, no!

03:53.984 --> 03:56.736
‐ (Screaming)
‐ (Evil laugh)

03:59.781 --> 04:01.032
(Evil laugh)

04:05.245 --> 04:07.164
‐ Hey, kids!
‐ Hey, Ms Jones.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.749
It's heading
towards Fifth Avenue!

04:09.749 --> 04:12.627
That ghost is called Krik‐Krok,
a Level‐4 that attacks

04:12.627 --> 04:14.045
by spreading plants everywhere.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.299
Enough to turn New York
into an urban jungle!

04:17.299 --> 04:19.634
<i>What's so bad</i>
<i>about the city going green?</i>

04:19.634 --> 04:21.803
I'm as eco‐friendly as you are,
Liv.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.848
But Krik‐Krok is no
garden‐friendly petunia.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.933
It ravages everything
in its path.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.935
So hurry up
and pluck that weed

04:28.935 --> 04:32.355
‐ before it feeds on fear!
<i>‐ And goes into booster mode.</i>

04:32.355 --> 04:34.691
<i>Don't worry Ms Jones,</i>
<i>we know the drill!</i>

04:34.691 --> 04:37.861
I'll send Glowboo as soon
as he's finished recharging.

04:37.861 --> 04:38.737
Happy hunting!

04:48.747 --> 04:51.416
Good going, Myst, who knew
you had such a green thumb?

04:51.416 --> 04:55.045
Me? This wouldn't have happened
if you didn't forget your plant!

04:55.045 --> 04:56.922
(Gasps)

04:59.424 --> 05:03.470
Callaghan reporting for duty!
The situation is under control!

05:07.390 --> 05:09.684
In the name of the law,
put your branches up!

05:16.608 --> 05:18.944
That's it! Run away, leaf face!

05:22.739 --> 05:23.949
(Laughter)

05:26.743 --> 05:29.329
We can't let him go
in booster mode!

05:43.593 --> 05:47.180
Uh‐oh! It's the not‐so‐jolly
green giant!

05:47.180 --> 05:49.558
Er, I don't like
the looks of that!

05:53.854 --> 05:55.272
Aaah!

06:04.030 --> 06:06.700
We can't fight it as long as
it's spitting out seeds!

06:12.205 --> 06:14.040
ALL: Huh?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.667
(Evil laugh)

06:25.635 --> 06:27.429
Fury, we create a diversion.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.306
Krush,
you attack it from the back!

06:40.066 --> 06:40.984
(Battle cry)

06:44.613 --> 06:46.740
Still thinking
that ghost saved your day?

06:49.951 --> 06:52.996
Just so you know, you're
the reason we're in this mess!

06:52.996 --> 06:54.706
Excuse me?

06:57.709 --> 06:59.044
I'm not the one
who woke that ghost up!

07:00.045 --> 07:03.798
You were stealing Prof Pascal's
plant, which is totally uncool!

07:04.382 --> 07:07.427
What would you prefer?
That I get another D?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.388
That I disappoint
Mom and Dad once again?

07:10.388 --> 07:12.891
Just sayin' you should own up
for your mistakes.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.313
Aaah!

07:19.356 --> 07:22.025
‐ Aaah!
‐ Myst!

07:26.279 --> 07:28.448
‐ Oh!
‐ It's working!

07:32.285 --> 07:33.203
Ugh!

07:36.247 --> 07:37.499
Oh, no!

07:40.335 --> 07:41.544
Ow!

07:42.796 --> 07:45.548
(Straining)

07:47.258 --> 07:50.387
‐ Fight without me.
‐ No, no one gets left behind!

07:50.387 --> 07:52.347
Krush can't do this alone.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.100
You got to block its leaves,
so we have a fighting chance!

07:55.100 --> 07:58.353
Listen to me!
You can do this. You have to.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.813
Huh?

08:08.863 --> 08:10.573
(Honking)

08:10.573 --> 08:13.284
<i>I've saved New York City</i>
<i>once again.</i>

08:13.284 --> 08:16.329
<i>Big muscles like that</i>
<i>imply great looks!</i>

08:16.329 --> 08:18.206
<i>Er... responsibility!</i>

08:18.206 --> 08:22.210
(Screaming)

08:24.129 --> 08:25.046
<i>Aaah!</i>

08:28.133 --> 08:31.344
You hired more extras?
Ha, ha! Excellent!

08:31.344 --> 08:34.264
Bravo! Keep filming, sweetie!

08:40.145 --> 08:42.272
Uh‐oh! Mom and Dad!

08:42.272 --> 08:43.481
Fury, remember the plan!

08:54.242 --> 08:56.828
OK, nice work!

08:56.828 --> 08:58.496
(Growls)

08:59.289 --> 09:02.000
I guess it's between
you and me now!

09:02.000 --> 09:02.917
Fractal Mace!

09:10.383 --> 09:12.218
Glowboo reporting for duty!

09:17.390 --> 09:20.602
You'll be safe here, citizens.

09:20.602 --> 09:24.064
Wow! Thanks, Fury!
What an honour to meet you!

09:24.064 --> 09:25.899
We're your biggest fans!

09:25.899 --> 09:28.651
You are such a great
role model for our kids!

09:28.651 --> 09:31.071
You should be proud.
Like Solarman says,

09:31.071 --> 09:34.949
"With cool powers
comes great responsibility!"

09:34.949 --> 09:36.451
Thanks.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.048
Glowboo,
use your powers to blind it!

09:54.010 --> 09:56.471
Mayday! Error detected.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.890
System damaged.

10:05.897 --> 10:06.689
Your move, Krush!

10:12.362 --> 10:13.363
Aaah!

10:16.199 --> 10:17.826
Back for Boofight!

10:18.243 --> 10:20.954
Oh, no! Glowboo?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.832
System damaged...

10:24.499 --> 10:25.834
Glowboo!

10:26.876 --> 10:29.504
Congrats, guys!
Now I can finish the job!

10:29.504 --> 10:30.797
BOTH: Myst!

10:32.799 --> 10:33.967
Octocat!

10:50.942 --> 10:52.819
Aaah!

11:13.173 --> 11:15.383
Boo‐ya!

11:15.383 --> 11:17.177
Excellent work, kids!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.262
But can you tell me
where Glowboo is?

11:19.262 --> 11:20.847
It's all good, Ms Jones.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.683
But we may need to send him
back to the lab.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.778
I was scared
of getting another D.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.990
So I took your plant
thinking you wouldn't notice.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.451
I'm sorry, Professor Pascal.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.078
Thank you, Andy. You're excused.

11:44.078 --> 11:47.123
Huh? That's it?
You're not flunking me?

11:47.123 --> 11:50.627
Owning up for your actions
is not a flunkable offence.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.130
Geraldine,
I was so worried about you!

11:55.882 --> 11:58.635
I'm proud of you, bro.
You did good.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.887
Now we can prepare
a new presentation!

12:00.887 --> 12:03.473
(Chuckles) And now that
everything's square,

12:03.473 --> 12:05.183
I can go shoot some baskets!

12:06.434 --> 12:08.061
Some things never change.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.415
All fresh for the day!

12:39.467 --> 12:41.010
<i>Hey, ghost fans!</i>

12:41.427 --> 12:43.763
<i>Welcome to another</i>
<i>exciting ghost blog!</i>

12:43.763 --> 12:45.932
<i>Today,</i>
<i>we're talking to New Yorkers</i>

12:45.932 --> 12:48.518
<i>about Ghost Force's</i>
<i>latest adventures,</i>

12:48.518 --> 12:50.228
<i>with my new cameraman!</i>

12:50.228 --> 12:52.480
<i>Say hi to the camera, Mike!</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:54.482
‐ Um...
‐ So, how was I?

12:54.482 --> 12:57.819
Um, you were a star.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.238
Thanks so much
for filling in for Liv.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.616
When she said she had to bail,
I thought, "Show's over!"

13:03.616 --> 13:07.412
I'm just happy to be with you...
I mean, help you.

13:10.873 --> 13:14.711
‐ They're so cute together!
‐ Yeah, adorkable.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.630
Anyway, now that
your matchmaking mission's a go,

13:17.630 --> 13:20.925
can we grab a bite?
I am starving!

13:20.925 --> 13:22.802
So, what do you wanna do
for lunch?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.346
Quick sandwich
or an actual sit‐down thing?

13:25.346 --> 13:28.641
Um... sitting down together
sounds nice.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.227
But, er, a quick sandwich
would be equally cool.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.104
Come on, Mike.
A proper lunch

13:33.104 --> 13:35.398
is way more
romantic than a sandwich.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.734
I would not say no to that!

13:38.151 --> 13:41.195
I mean,
both have pros and cons.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.157
Ah! Forget lunch!
We've got our first interview!

13:45.491 --> 13:46.492
Morning, Lt Callaghan.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.077
This is Charlie,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.455
reporting for the ghost blog.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.624
As a member of the force,
you must often work side by side

13:53.624 --> 13:56.502
with the Ghost Force,
but how well do you know them?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.839
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>Am I being interviewed?</i>

13:59.839 --> 14:02.592
<i>Well, it's your lucky day,</i>
<i>ghost fans,</i>

14:02.592 --> 14:06.429
<i>'cause no one knows the Ghost</i>
<i>Force better than yours truly!</i>

14:06.429 --> 14:07.180
<i>I'm kind of an expert.</i>

14:08.389 --> 14:11.517
Between you and me, they always
come to me for pro tips.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.229
Hey, who wants to come along on
a little tour of the places

14:15.229 --> 14:17.982
where the star lieutenant
helped the Ghost Force?

14:17.982 --> 14:21.360
‐ A one‐on‐one interview?
‐ An exclusive!

14:21.360 --> 14:24.655
So, should I ride up front
or in the back with you?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.324
You know, for camera angles?

14:26.324 --> 14:28.951
Uh, well, it's really your call.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.578
But if you ride shotgun,
we won't ‐‐

14:30.578 --> 14:32.205
Hop in!

14:37.335 --> 14:38.544
Woohoo!

14:38.544 --> 14:39.837
(Switches on the sirens)

14:42.840 --> 14:45.718
‐ What are they doing?
‐ Double cheddar cheese,

14:45.718 --> 14:48.387
with chocolate sauce
and extra pickles!

14:49.722 --> 14:53.059
I thought this moment
would never come!

14:53.851 --> 14:56.020
So, what are you having, Liv?

15:02.318 --> 15:03.820
Aaah!

15:03.820 --> 15:06.280
‐ (Evil laugh)
‐ A ghost!

15:06.280 --> 15:07.240
Oh!

15:10.868 --> 15:12.495
(Screaming)

15:12.495 --> 15:14.789
(Evil laugh)

15:14.789 --> 15:17.792
No, no, no! Not Roland's truck!

15:39.939 --> 15:44.569
My burger!
We barely had any time together!

15:46.279 --> 15:48.156
‐ Ms Jones, we're kinda in ‐‐
‐ <i>I know.</i>

15:48.614 --> 15:51.242
<i>You're dealing with a ghost</i>
<i>I don't know anything about.</i>

15:51.242 --> 15:54.036
‐ He merged with my burger!
‐ <i>Oh, no!</i>

15:54.036 --> 15:57.206
<i>I guess that makes it...</i>
<i>a Burghoerer!</i>

15:57.206 --> 15:59.083
(Snorts with laughter)

15:59.458 --> 16:02.461
<i>But, seriously, you three</i>
<i>will need to be on guard.</i>

16:02.461 --> 16:03.796
<i>Uh, where's Mike?</i>

16:04.338 --> 16:07.383
Yeah, he's kinda got a thing.
But we can handle this!

16:07.383 --> 16:10.303
<i>Oh, OK.</i>
<i>I'll send Glowboo as backup.</i>

16:10.303 --> 16:11.429
<i>Happy hunting, kiddos!</i>

16:12.430 --> 16:15.349
No way we're ruining
Mike's big day with Charlie.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.101
He's had
a crush on her for weeks!

16:17.101 --> 16:19.896
We'll eat that Burghoerer
for breakfast!

16:19.896 --> 16:22.481
Let's go, Ghost Force!

16:23.065 --> 16:25.109
<i>Ghost Force,</i>
<i>don't fear the glow!</i>

16:30.323 --> 16:31.616
Fury!

16:32.909 --> 16:34.285
Myst!

16:36.621 --> 16:38.080
Ghost Force!

16:39.457 --> 16:41.292
(Honking)

16:42.210 --> 16:44.545
<i>Did I mention that time</i>
<i>a super stinky ghost</i>

16:44.545 --> 16:47.840
<i>took over Times Square?</i>
<i>Made my nostrils flare!</i>

16:47.840 --> 16:50.843
<i>So I said to myself,</i>
<i>"Let's show it who's boss."</i>

16:50.843 --> 16:54.013
<i>‐ So that's what I did. The end</i>
‐ Right...

16:54.013 --> 16:57.266
Uh, I was hoping you'd tell us
about the Ghost Force.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.727
And didn't Krush step in
to save the day?

16:59.727 --> 17:02.438
More like tiptoed.
I, on the other hand,

17:02.438 --> 17:05.274
‐ scaled the Empire State B ‐‐
‐ Aaah!

17:06.400 --> 17:08.486
(Screaming)

17:09.111 --> 17:11.989
RADIO: <i>Calling all vehicles.</i>
<i>There's a ghost on 5th Avenue.</i>

17:12.406 --> 17:16.619
‐ Aaah!
‐ Boo! Ha, ha, ha!

17:21.999 --> 17:24.252
Ghost Force!

17:28.673 --> 17:30.508
Talk about an exclusive!

17:30.508 --> 17:32.885
You must be my lucky charm,
Mike.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.888
We've got a front seat
to all the action!

17:35.888 --> 17:38.933
Yeah.
Not sure that's a good idea.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.977
All units remain calm.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.104
Lt Callaghan
is large and in charge!

17:57.952 --> 17:59.120
(Evil laugh)

18:04.125 --> 18:05.835
Yes, the Ghost Force!

18:10.715 --> 18:11.924
Grr!

18:15.011 --> 18:16.345
Flexy blast!

18:22.685 --> 18:26.230
‐ It wasn't even affected!
‐ Negative, you made it laugh.

18:28.858 --> 18:32.194
‐ Aaah!
‐ Spectral Gate!

18:37.033 --> 18:38.993
Get ready, Mike!

18:42.038 --> 18:44.165
Buns where I can see 'em!

18:44.165 --> 18:46.917
I'm warning you, I'm taking
an online class in karate!

18:47.585 --> 18:48.753
What do we do, sis?

18:49.170 --> 18:51.005
We gotta keep it
from splitting into layers!

18:53.674 --> 18:54.759
You recording this?

19:06.604 --> 19:08.522
Aaah!

19:15.446 --> 19:19.241
Karate... rate... rate...
karate...

19:20.910 --> 19:22.119
Myst! Behind you!

19:23.704 --> 19:24.622
Aaah!

19:25.706 --> 19:27.166
BOTH: Myst!

19:28.501 --> 19:30.002
Aaah!

19:31.587 --> 19:33.923
You just messed
with the wrong Lieutenant!

19:33.923 --> 19:36.634
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say ‐‐

19:38.052 --> 19:40.346
Can I have fries with that?

19:40.763 --> 19:43.516
We've gotta combine our powers
to attack all those layers.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.059
Gotcha.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.186
Let's de‐boost
that fast‐food phantom!

19:51.732 --> 19:53.442
But where's Krush?

19:55.736 --> 19:58.781
<i>What are you waiting for, Mike?</i>
<i>Your team needs you!</i>

19:58.781 --> 20:02.785
Mike! Let's move, the Ghost
Force is in Times Square!

20:02.785 --> 20:06.831
Stop! I mean, you should stay
here, Charlie, it's not safe.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.291
Don't be scared.
I'm right by your side.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.961
We're a team now,
so we're sticking together!

20:11.961 --> 20:13.379
We are?

20:34.692 --> 20:36.944
(Gasps)

20:36.944 --> 20:37.820
Flexy shield!

20:43.868 --> 20:46.162
We could really use
Krush's help.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.163
You getting this, Mike?

20:48.205 --> 20:50.875
<i>We're just reaching Times Squar</i>
<i>where the ghost has unleashed</i>

20:50.875 --> 20:52.376
<i>a chaos of condiments.</i>

20:57.381 --> 20:58.257
Oh, no, Charlie!

21:06.182 --> 21:08.976
Thanks. Where's the phone?
We need to film this!

21:08.976 --> 21:10.352
Charlie!

21:13.147 --> 21:16.817
‐ I... I can't.
‐ What? Why?

21:16.817 --> 21:19.862
Sorry, Charlie. I can't explain.

21:19.862 --> 21:23.365
‐ I thought we were a team?
‐ Just be careful. Promise?

21:23.365 --> 21:24.950
Mike!
I can't do this without you!

21:26.202 --> 21:27.661
I'm sorry.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.163
Mike!

21:29.914 --> 21:32.750
(Groans) Well, if I'm gonna be
stuck, might as well enjoy it.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.428
Not now!

21:45.137 --> 21:47.473
Aaah!

21:47.473 --> 21:48.766
Oh!

21:48.766 --> 21:51.143
(Evil laugh)

21:53.771 --> 21:54.730
Krush!

21:55.731 --> 21:57.483
Sorry I'm late! I had a thing.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.486
(Battle cry)

22:07.660 --> 22:09.995
‐ Krush!
‐ (Evil laugh)

22:10.704 --> 22:12.164
(Burps)

22:18.170 --> 22:19.421
Dinner's served!

22:22.007 --> 22:23.634
Growmax!

22:37.147 --> 22:38.524
(Cry of panic)

22:59.169 --> 23:01.088
All units, stand down.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.841
Lt Callaghan
has subdued the ghost.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.269
Weird, Mike's never late.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.812
Except when he plays Romeo!

23:17.688 --> 23:18.564
Oh...

23:19.982 --> 23:22.234
Charlie must hate me right now.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.070
Chill, dude, superheroes
gotta make tough choices,

23:25.070 --> 23:28.365
but I got a feeling it's
all gonna turn out just fine.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.992
And how exactly is that ‐‐

23:29.992 --> 23:31.327
Mike, we need to talk.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.124
How did you get my phone
back into my locker?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.376
Liv said you knew
how to work a camera,

23:39.376 --> 23:42.922
but this footage is insane!
I love it!

23:45.591 --> 23:47.927
I just had a good view
from my hiding spot!

23:47.927 --> 23:49.511
My hero!

23:50.804 --> 23:51.931
Yeah!
