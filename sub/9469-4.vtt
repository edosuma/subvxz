WEBVTT

00:06.560 --> 00:08.800
[man] All right, then she
comes running at me, like,

00:08.960 --> 00:11.240
with a huge sheet cake and
just throws it at my feet,

00:11.360 --> 00:13.520
screaming about how I don't
pay enough attention to her.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.840
- What a skank.
- Yeah, and then my buddy Mark,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.280
who was high as fuck, just comes over,
kneels down, sticks his face in it,

00:19.400 --> 00:21.680
and starts eating it like a dog.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.480
Yeah. And then she started to cry

00:23.600 --> 00:25.640
and got her dad to throw me
out of my own party, so...

00:25.760 --> 00:28.040
- No way.
- Yeah.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.120
And that's why I don't
celebrate my birthday. [Chuckles]

00:31.240 --> 00:33.840
That sucks.

00:34.001 --> 00:37.280
- Pretty funny though.
- [laughing]

00:37.400 --> 00:38.840
Yeah.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.760
- No, wait.
- I'm sorry. I thought that, uh...

01:05.840 --> 01:09.520
- Chill. I just have to pee.
- Oh.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.560
[chuckles]

01:11.640 --> 01:13.840
Well, um, can I come?

01:15.800 --> 01:17.520
Maybe when I get back.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.680
[shrieks]

02:01.800 --> 02:03.160
You OK?

02:05.120 --> 02:07.400
- I'm fine.
- OK.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.840
Hey, cutie. [Giggles]

02:21.120 --> 02:23.640
[gasping]

02:23.720 --> 02:26.240
[gasping loudly]

02:28.640 --> 02:31.600
[screaming]

02:33.680 --> 02:36.440
[sirens wailing]

02:36.520 --> 02:37.800
[sniffing]

02:37.880 --> 02:40.960
- What have we got?
- Twenty-52.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.280
Those kids found the DB. All three pieces.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.640
- [man] Damn...
- [man 2] Yeah.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.880
- Geek squad on its way?
- Twenty minutes out.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.960
[exhales]

02:54.040 --> 02:56.080
I'm supposed to be balls
deep in my wife right now

02:56.160 --> 02:58.680
- instead of freezing 'em off out here.
- Her birthday?

02:58.760 --> 03:01.960
Had to give away tickets to the
game on account of her ovulating.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.200
You gotta to be one sick fuck
to do something like this.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.880
Female. Young, near as I can tell.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.720
Been here 24 hours, give or take,
judging from the insect larvae.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.800
That girl's grave got robbed yesterday.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.360
Any connection?

03:16.440 --> 03:18.960
Eh... Let's leave that
to the propeller heads.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.960
I'm gonna go set up a perimeter before
looky-loos and news trucks descend.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.560
On that other matter...

03:25.000 --> 03:27.560
- Let it soak.
- Huh?

03:27.680 --> 03:30.320
Next time you throw a hump into the missus,

03:30.400 --> 03:32.440
let it soak.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.020
Yeah.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.160
[indistinct police radio chatter]

03:38.303 --> 03:41.443
<i>[officer] May I ask what the two
of you were doing out here so late?</i>

03:41.563 --> 03:42.680
<i>[girl] We were on a date and...</i>

04:02.803 --> 04:06.203
[eerie, melancholic theme music playing]

04:54.080 --> 04:56.200
<i>[Pryce] See to it the
plasma level is raised.</i>

04:56.320 --> 05:00.240
<i>I want to increase amniotic
nutritional value by a factor of three.</i>

05:00.360 --> 05:03.440
That will destabilize its
growth rate. Is that wise?

05:03.560 --> 05:05.720
My research in the
Serbian camps indicated...

05:05.840 --> 05:08.040
It's my understanding
your subjects were human

05:08.120 --> 05:10.400
and you weren't necessarily
interested in their longevity.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.680
- [elevator dings]
- Yes, but I am...

05:11.760 --> 05:13.600
Yes, but what?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.720
I will do it right away.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.640
- Oh. This is a surprise.
- You son of a bitch.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.960
- Where's Marie? Where is she?
- I have no idea.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.480
She names you specifically
in the lawsuit, and now,

05:25.560 --> 05:27.120
surprise, surprise, she's gone?

05:27.200 --> 05:29.000
Let go of me, Norman.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.720
If I find out that you had anything
at all to do with her disappearance,

05:32.840 --> 05:36.400
I will tear you down and
everything that you have ever built.

05:36.480 --> 05:40.040
I'm sure that won't be
necessary. But be careful.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.800
Start tearing down my house,

05:41.880 --> 05:45.600
you may be surprised by what
comes crawling out of the rubble.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.880
Fuck you, Johann.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.600
<i>I want the blueprints.
Yes, the subbasement.</i>

06:01.720 --> 06:04.440
Scan and send them to
me as soon as possible.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.440
No, it's not gonna take a couple of days,

06:06.520 --> 06:09.320
because you're gonna tell that
miserable prick that I need them now!

06:17.640 --> 06:19.520
- Someone didn't come home last night.
- [gasps]

06:19.640 --> 06:21.520
Oh, crap, you scared me.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.160
Is everything OK?

06:27.240 --> 06:30.840
Yeah, actually, for the first
time in a couple days, it is.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.400
You missed my <i>coq au vin</i>.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.600
You made it?

06:39.680 --> 06:42.760
Well, Conway made it, but
I'm pretty sure I told him to.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.960
So, um, where were you?

06:53.040 --> 06:55.880
I was out with a friend.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.360
I didn't think you knew anyone in town.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.320
I do now.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.160
You make friends fast.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.800
It's a gift.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.760
So, I, uh, I got some good news.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.280
Um, I found out my car
might be ready this evening,

07:16.400 --> 07:18.960
so I could be out of here by tonight.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.280
But I just want to thank you for
everything you've done for me.

07:21.400 --> 07:26.360
You've been really kind, and...
and I don't want to take advantage.

07:26.526 --> 07:28.762
[heart beating slowly]

07:31.640 --> 07:33.240
Are you OK?

07:36.946 --> 07:39.480
[heart beats faster]

07:39.560 --> 07:41.160
Are you all right?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.880
- Roman?
- Please don't!

07:50.760 --> 07:54.080
I'm sorry. I'm... just, um...

07:55.160 --> 07:56.640
I'm sorry.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.720
I'm sorry. I'm late for a meeting.
I really don't have time to...

08:12.840 --> 08:14.520
Wait, wait, wait. I need to talk you.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.960
I got a call last night from the police.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.080
Christina Wendall's corpse
was removed from her grave.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.600
They found footprints near the body.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.680
They're... saying it was Shelley.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.160
That's impossible. My sister's dead.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.960
We don't know that. Not for certain.

08:32.039 --> 08:35.440
Anyway, they're... they're
out looking for her now.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.080
- Does Olivia know?
- Yeah. Yeah, I spoke with her earlier.

08:39.159 --> 08:43.640
You said Christina was mutilated. How?

08:43.720 --> 08:45.600
Decapitated.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.360
Head torn in half.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.640
Anyway, I'll... let you get going.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.240
Hey, Norman.

08:55.320 --> 08:58.120
That investigator you hired
when Shelley disappeared,

08:58.200 --> 09:00.600
you should get her back on the case.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.120
It's already done.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.760
[music playing quietly]

09:14.868 --> 09:17.268
[plane buzzing]

09:24.248 --> 09:26.248
[phone beeping]

09:28.408 --> 09:30.588
[line ringing]

09:31.760 --> 09:34.080
Hi, my name is Darren Allen.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.800
I do marketing with
Penultimate Innovations.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.360
Uh-huh, that's right, we make the pens.

09:39.440 --> 09:44.600
Uh, I was wondering if you hangar a
biplane that tows advertising banners.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.680
I see.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.880
All right, well, thank you for your time.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.960
[whispers] Fuck me.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.960
[pounding on door]

10:01.080 --> 10:03.320
[pounding on door]

10:03.400 --> 10:05.160
Fuck off.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.400
You ass raped us, you fucking little fuck.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.560
How'd you do it? You got mirrors
in here, some shit like that?

10:11.640 --> 10:14.600
- This isn't a good time, guys.
- We want our goddamn money back.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.960
Where's the dog? I know there was a dog.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.840
You can't fake that kind of realism.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.360
- He's at the vet.
- Stop fucking with us.

10:23.760 --> 10:27.280
I said I don't have it!

10:27.360 --> 10:29.280
- Fuck.
- Where is it?

10:29.360 --> 10:31.600
OK, OK. I'll tell you exactly where it is.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.320
I took it and I gave it to an
attorney to get someone out of a jam.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.680
All of it. And it's not coming back.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.040
So you can beat the shit out of me,
but you're still not gonna get it.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.680
You're lying. He's trying to fuck us again.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.720
- Give us the goddamn money!
- Ugh!

10:42.809 --> 10:44.449
- [bones cracking]
- [low growling]

10:44.600 --> 10:46.320
Fuck!

10:46.400 --> 10:48.120
Where is it?

10:48.200 --> 10:50.280
- [gasping]
- Where the fuck is it?

10:50.360 --> 10:52.200
Where is that fucking money, man?

10:52.280 --> 10:54.880
Fuck! Little fucking prick!

10:54.969 --> 10:56.749
[cracking]

10:58.640 --> 11:01.080
It's here somewhere, all
right? We gotta find it.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.320
Where is it, dickweed?

11:04.440 --> 11:06.000
Oh! Fuck!

11:06.120 --> 11:08.480
Ah!

11:08.600 --> 11:10.200
Grab an ice pack from the freezer!

11:11.640 --> 11:14.120
- Oh, fuck.
- What?

11:14.240 --> 11:17.280
- Do it!
- Oh, fuck...

11:17.400 --> 11:20.240
You sack the fuck up. You ain't dying.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.979
- [cracks]
- [screams]

11:23.059 --> 11:25.480
There, now it'll heal straight.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.880
Put that on your friend's nose.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.440
Now, get out of my house.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.400
Get the fuck out of my house!

11:35.480 --> 11:37.480
[Richie whimpering]

11:40.480 --> 11:42.480
- [door closes]
- [groans]

11:44.480 --> 11:47.480
[gasps, growls]

11:47.600 --> 11:49.800
- [bones cracking]
- [grunting]

12:25.680 --> 12:27.560
[groaning]

12:54.520 --> 12:56.600
Miss Cates.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.280
You dropped this.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.320
Thank you.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.800
- [elevator dings]
- [man] Sorry, no.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.840
Again, I am not authorized to
give out his private number.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.600
Well, I'm afraid that's
anatomically impossible.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.760
Biatch. [Sighs]

13:25.160 --> 13:26.880
Were you able to get the blueprints?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.600
[clears throat] Yes. Yes, sir.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.520
Good man.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.840
Oh, I, uh, also have the
quarterly reports for you to sign.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.820
[sighs]

13:37.960 --> 13:40.360
[heart beating, blood swirling]

13:56.720 --> 13:58.600
Perfect.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.320
Where's Level S5?

14:06.440 --> 14:09.120
- Uh, It should all be there.
- Well, it isn't.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.480
What the fuck is your problem that
you can't even do a simple task, huh?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.640
Maybe you scrolled past...

14:13.720 --> 14:15.560
Listen to me, you worthless piece of shit.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.360
When I ask you to do something, I
expect it to be done properly, OK?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.840
I'm running a business,
not a daycare for fucktards.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.000
I have no time for incompetence!

14:26.800 --> 14:29.520
And that goes for every
other mouth breather in here!

14:29.600 --> 14:34.040
Now, clean that shit up, get me a new
one, and find that goddamn blueprint!

14:51.520 --> 14:53.960
- [man] Miss Godfrey?
- Yes?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.560
Sheriff Michael Chasseur. I'm
sorry to bother you, but...

14:56.680 --> 14:59.120
Oh, the replacement.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.280
Right. Do you have a moment?

15:01.360 --> 15:04.480
- Now?
- Oh, if it's no trouble.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.280
Not at all.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.720
I will tell you the same thing I
told your deputy over the phone.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.000
I haven't heard from my
daughter, and the fact that

15:16.080 --> 15:19.120
- you people keep opening this wound is...
- Marie Godfrey has gone missing.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.360
- What?
- That's why I'm here.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.400
Her housekeeper reported that
she didn't come home last night.

15:25.480 --> 15:32.120
Normally we wouldn't take an interest
until we at least had a few days go by.

15:32.200 --> 15:35.240
But we just found her car
in a long-term parking lot.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.640
Maybe she went on a last-minute trip?

15:37.720 --> 15:40.240
It seemed to be wiped clean of prints.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.040
Not the sort of thing you
do if you're headed for Cabo.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.040
Oh, my God. What do you
think happened to her?

15:46.120 --> 15:48.000
We don't know.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.520
Well, whatever I can do to help, I will.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.000
When was the last time you saw her?

15:55.080 --> 15:57.560
She was here yesterday,
but I assume you knew that

15:57.640 --> 15:59.440
or you wouldn't be here.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.440
True enough.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.520
One of the groundskeepers
saw her knock on your door.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.320
Can you tell me the nature of her visit?

16:07.400 --> 16:10.680
She came to tell me she was filing
a lawsuit against Godfrey Industries.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.280
Was she upset?

16:12.360 --> 16:16.520
Since the death of her daughter and
grandchild, she always seemed that way.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.320
- Who can blame her?
- Did she say anything else?

16:19.400 --> 16:22.320
Where she might be going? Anyone
else she was seeing later that day?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.520
No, she didn't.

16:26.640 --> 16:30.200
Marie Godfrey is the second
woman to go missing from here

16:30.280 --> 16:32.000
in the last seven months.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.320
Wasn't there a fish and game warden?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.600
That was my sister, Clementine.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.800
- I'm so sorry.
- Did you know her?

16:41.880 --> 16:44.400
No, we never met.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.000
- But it was in all the papers.
- The last call she made

16:47.080 --> 16:50.160
came from a cell tower
near the Godfrey mill.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.040
Any idea what she'd be doing there?

16:53.120 --> 16:57.520
No, the mill's been abandoned for years,
save for the derelicts and teenagers.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.440
Well, it was worth a shot.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.480
I do hope you find her.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.000
I appreciate that.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.280
Thanks for the help. I'll let myself out.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.240
So, what's behind door number three?

17:33.320 --> 17:34.480
Is that where you hide the bodies?

17:44.580 --> 17:46.340
[door opens]

17:47.895 --> 17:49.875
[door closes]

17:54.440 --> 17:57.800
[beeping]

18:26.800 --> 18:29.560
[loud rock music playing]

18:37.480 --> 18:39.960
- Who are you?
- Gwen Epps.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.000
Head of Human Resources?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.240
- And?
- And apparently,

18:45.360 --> 18:47.440
there was an incident earlier.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.800
Several employees lodged
complaints against you

18:49.880 --> 18:52.080
for creating a hostile work environment.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.400
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
- I'm not.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.800
Now, policy requires
a de-escalation period.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.120
I'm going to have to ask
you to gather your things.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.600
- Are you telling me to go home?
- Not at all.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.680
You just have to leave the building.

19:12.480 --> 19:16.560
I'm gonna recommend you register
for our anger management workshop.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.280
It's, um...

19:18.360 --> 19:20.880
[heart beating rapidly]

19:35.520 --> 19:37.400
It wasn't me.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.440
Hey, man, can you help me out?
Just a little. Just a little.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.720
Just a little. Hey...

19:46.840 --> 19:48.880
Hey, ladies. Please throw a little my way?

19:51.120 --> 19:53.680
Hey, man. Hey, brother,
you can help me out?

19:57.560 --> 19:59.720
Dollar, brother?

19:59.840 --> 20:02.480
A five, a ten, a 20, it
don't matter. I make change.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.320
[laughing]

20:04.400 --> 20:07.800
OK, I get it, I get it, I get it.
You want to see me work for it.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.160
How 'bout I... I tell you a joke?

20:10.240 --> 20:12.440
A baboon, a chick with a dick,

20:12.520 --> 20:15.000
and Jesus walk into...

20:15.080 --> 20:17.400
Hey, I ain't finished yet!

20:17.480 --> 20:19.720
<i>Give me a chance, man!</i>

20:19.800 --> 20:23.440
<i>Where are you going, man?
I'm just talking to you.</i>

20:23.520 --> 20:25.200
<i>You were looking at me.</i>

20:25.280 --> 20:27.620
<i>Turn around, motherfucker! Turn around!</i>

20:28.720 --> 20:31.080
<i>Give me a chance.</i>

20:31.160 --> 20:33.680
<i>Walk off, then. Go ahead.</i>

20:33.760 --> 20:35.360
<i>Fuck you, then.</i>

20:45.800 --> 20:48.120
[whimpering]

20:48.200 --> 20:50.880
[weeping quietly]

20:52.360 --> 20:55.720
Hi. Uh, my name is Gomez
Pugh with Root Cola.

20:55.800 --> 21:00.280
I was told that you might hangar a
biplane that does promotional banners?

21:00.400 --> 21:05.320
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, we're looking
to do some non-conventional advertising.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.280
You do?

21:10.640 --> 21:14.320
OK, uh, where exactly are you located?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.200
Uh-huh.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.280
Uh-huh, OK. Thank you.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.640
Shit.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.320
[mimicking engine noise]

21:55.480 --> 21:57.400
Jack, stay on the sidewalk.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.400
- [phone ringing in house]
- OK.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.560
Sidewalk, mister. I'll be right back.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.138
[plane buzzing]

22:32.040 --> 22:34.178
[buzzing]

22:37.619 --> 22:38.819
Come on!

22:45.080 --> 22:46.600
[tires screeching]

22:53.280 --> 22:56.960
Jack! Oh, my God, Jack!

23:00.040 --> 23:01.680
Jack.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.360
Oh, God, baby, are you OK?

23:04.440 --> 23:07.800
Oh, Mommy was so worried.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.840
I think he's all right.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.840
Thank you.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.560
If you hadn't stopped when
you did, that car might have...

23:14.640 --> 23:16.840
I don't know how he didn't see him.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.080
He did.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.960
I... I know how this is sounds,

23:23.040 --> 23:25.200
and there's no way that I could possibly
explain it that will make any sense,

23:25.280 --> 23:27.080
but someone's trying to
kill you and your son.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.880
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter who I am.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.880
You just need to get your son to
a place where he can't find you.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.080
- Who's he?
- I don't know!

23:33.160 --> 23:35.680
- You're scaring him.
- He should be scared and so should you.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.520
I don't know what this is all about,
but you better to stay away from us.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.720
Let me make this really fucking simple.
Either someone is trying to kill your son

23:40.800 --> 23:42.440
and you need to get out of
town, or a deranged freak,

23:42.520 --> 23:44.760
who knows exactly where you live,
is telling you to get out of town.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.040
- Either way, you need to listen.
- You're hurting me.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.200
Promise me you're gonna leave
town right now. Promise me!

23:52.680 --> 23:54.320
OK!

24:13.240 --> 24:17.440
<i>Absolutely not. Marie
wouldn't hurt herself.</i>

24:17.520 --> 24:19.800
Trust me, I've treated enough
people to see the warning signs.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.520
I imagine you have.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.440
You know, why aren't you talking to
Pryce? She names him in a lawsuit and then

24:24.520 --> 24:26.440
suddenly she goes missing?
Don't you think that's...

24:26.520 --> 24:28.440
- I've already had that conversation.
- And?

24:28.520 --> 24:30.440
And there's no reason to suspect
him. I checked video surveillance.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.480
- He never left the building.
- Bullshit.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.000
That son of a bitch
could have hired someone.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.400
Is there any bad blood
between you and your ex-wife?

24:37.480 --> 24:40.480
[scoffs] This is ridiculous.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.960
Mr. Godfrey, I'm here to
find out what happened.

24:46.800 --> 24:51.160
Well, after the divorce, she hated me.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.320
Our child died and I abandoned her.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.320
What kind of a man does that?

24:57.480 --> 25:01.320
But she forgave me. That's
the kind of person Marie is.

25:01.400 --> 25:05.600
No matter how bad someone hurt her,
she could always see the good in them.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.200
She could always see the good in me.

25:08.280 --> 25:13.240
Tell me the nature of the relationship
between your ex-wife and your girlfriend.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.440
They didn't have one.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.840
- Any animosity between the two?
- No.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.760
No, it's been several months since
they even talked to each other.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.600
I spoke to Olivia Godfrey earlier

25:23.680 --> 25:27.680
and she said that Marie had paid her a
visit yesterday after serving Dr. Pryce.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.040
- What?
- She didn't mention that?

25:32.960 --> 25:34.640
Uh, no.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.960
Well, she's been going through
a lot with her recovery, so...

25:37.040 --> 25:39.160
Must have just slipped her mind.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.600
Yeah.

25:44.680 --> 25:46.440
Exactly which part?

25:46.580 --> 25:48.680
<i>[man] It's the alternator. It's
on back order from Pittsburgh.</i>

25:48.760 --> 25:51.840
Fine, fine. Just call
me as soon as it's ready.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.800
Shit.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.800
[doorbell rings]

26:05.960 --> 26:07.880
<i>[woman] Oh, hi, mind if I come in?</i>

26:08.000 --> 26:11.080
I'm Brenda, with the
Citizen Action Committee.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.280
I was hoping you'd be
willing to sign this petition

26:14.360 --> 26:17.080
to institute mandatory background checks

26:17.160 --> 26:21.240
on anyone purchasing a
handgun in Hemlock County.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.480
Sure. I'd be glad to.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.960
Oh... That sort of thing
used to happen to me

26:32.040 --> 26:34.480
all the time when I popped my first out.

26:34.559 --> 26:37.200
Best thing I ever did
was invest in bra pads.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.480
They actually make these
milk collection shells,

26:39.560 --> 26:42.520
so you just empty them
out when they fill up.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.800
Saved me a fortune on dry cleaning.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.360
Um, I don't... I don't have any.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.280
- Excuse me?
- Kids.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.960
I don't... uh, I don't have any.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.480
Oh.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.640
[Brenda] Thanks.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.000
[phone ringing]

27:15.080 --> 27:16.360
- Hey.
<i>- [Peter] Hey.</i>

27:16.440 --> 27:20.360
Um, I just wanted to let you know
that I had a great time last night,

27:20.440 --> 27:22.680
and I thought you might want to hang later.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.760
<i>There's some weird shit going on,</i>

27:24.840 --> 27:27.520
<i>and I could use a drink or two... or seven.</i>

27:27.600 --> 27:29.640
Uh, no, I can't. Um...

27:29.720 --> 27:32.240
I've got... I've got some stuff to
take care of before I leave town.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.360
<i>Is everything OK? I meant to call earlier.</i>

27:34.440 --> 27:36.240
Um, I'm fine, I'm fine.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.480
<i>I just, uh... Look, I gotta go.</i>

27:47.640 --> 27:49.680
[siren chirps]

27:52.520 --> 27:54.320
Fuck.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.200
[Chasseur] Cap.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.800
This is stupid. I didn't do anything.

28:07.080 --> 28:11.680
No, what's bullshit is when I receive
a call from the Greensburg sheriff

28:11.800 --> 28:14.880
about you making threats
against a single mom and her son.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.560
I saved the kid's life.
Did she leave that part out?

28:17.640 --> 28:20.200
You scared that woman so bad, she left
town because she was afraid you'd...

28:20.280 --> 28:22.320
I was trying to warn her.

28:22.400 --> 28:26.280
You drive 75 miles to warn a
woman you've never met before?

28:26.360 --> 28:28.320
How does that work exactly?

28:29.720 --> 28:32.520
Who is she to you?

28:36.280 --> 28:38.960
Seen much of Roman Godfrey
since you've been back?

28:41.320 --> 28:44.120
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Heard you two were close.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.680
Then left town right after all
those school girls got butchered.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.400
Seems you have a talent for
disappearing when things go bad.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.800
Well, I'm a talented guy.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.400
Heard Lynda Rumancek got
grabbed up by law enforcement.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.280
That's your mother, right?

28:58.360 --> 29:00.560
I guess the rotten apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.520
- Say my mother's name again and I swear...
- Or you'll what?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.280
You can't keep me here
unless you're charging me.

29:05.360 --> 29:09.120
I can hold you here for 24 hours on
suspicion of being suspicious if I want.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.680
I suggest you get comfortable.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.240
<i>[Richie] I'm not the one
who went all bitch in there.</i>

29:27.320 --> 29:28.520
<i>[Dom] You screamed like one.</i>

29:28.600 --> 29:31.440
<i>[Richie] Fuck you. At least I
didn't stand there pissing my pants.</i>

29:31.520 --> 29:33.360
Blow me.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.520
<i>You're gonna wanna... shut that door.</i>

29:50.800 --> 29:53.320
Now, from the look of
you sorry sons of bitches,

29:53.400 --> 29:55.761
I'm guessing it didn't go well.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.840
Now...

29:57.960 --> 30:01.680
Unless you have my money
shoved up your bungholes,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.880
I going to assume that you
weren't able to retrieve it.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.640
However, in the... interest of
fairness, I suppose should ask.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.000
Do you?

30:14.480 --> 30:15.600
Do we what?

30:15.680 --> 30:17.880
Have my money shoved up your bungholes.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.800
- No.
- Hmm...

30:20.880 --> 30:23.240
- That is unfortunate.
- He fucked us.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.880
Of course he did. He is a Gypsy.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.120
He's doing exactly what
his kind was born to do.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.640
Blaming him would be like blaming
a dog for licking its own ass.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.040
Now, this is on you.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.960
Mr. Beaumont, we can get it back...

30:36.040 --> 30:39.720
Stop... speaking, son.

30:45.400 --> 30:49.720
Now, we are in a pickle, and
I only see one way out of it.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.520
Take off your clothes.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.160
[laughing]

31:02.080 --> 31:04.600
Don't be shy.

31:08.280 --> 31:11.760
Take... [shotgun clicks]

31:11.840 --> 31:14.040
Your fucking clothes off.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.320
<i>[Norman] I don't know
if you're alive or dead,</i>

31:17.440 --> 31:20.160
<i>but they're hunting you again.</i>

31:20.240 --> 31:23.120
<i>I know you're not responsible.</i>

31:23.200 --> 31:27.240
<i>If others could see your
heart, they would know, too.</i>

31:27.320 --> 31:29.520
<i>I'm not sure why I keep writing to you,</i>

31:29.600 --> 31:31.840
<i>but I believe it helps me.</i>

31:31.960 --> 31:33.800
<i>It keeps you alive for me.</i>

31:35.960 --> 31:40.320
<i>Shelley, if you're out
there, please respond.</i>

31:40.400 --> 31:42.560
<i>I can protect you.</i>

31:45.280 --> 31:48.000
<i>I miss you so damn much.</i>

31:48.080 --> 31:49.720
[boy] I'm magic.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.760
Wanna see?

32:00.440 --> 32:01.960
- Ah!
- [gasps]

32:07.640 --> 32:09.560
Don't be scared.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.720
It's right here.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.200
I told you.

32:28.427 --> 32:30.507
[cracks]

32:30.600 --> 32:32.480
Can I have it?

32:35.040 --> 32:37.000
This is so cool.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.560
My grandpa taught me that trick.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.000
I miss him.

32:45.240 --> 32:46.880
Do you have a grandpa?

32:49.440 --> 32:51.240
A daddy?

32:52.800 --> 32:54.480
A mommy?

32:56.880 --> 32:58.640
Anybody?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.000
[glass breaking]

33:12.080 --> 33:13.840
Someone's here.

33:13.987 --> 33:16.067
[footsteps overhead]

33:21.160 --> 33:23.840
<i>- [man] All right, you ready?
- [woman] Yeah. Score.</i>

33:23.960 --> 33:25.600
<i>[man] OK. Let's go.</i>

33:29.640 --> 33:32.080
[man and woman speaking indistinctly]

33:47.600 --> 33:49.400
[sighs]

34:02.400 --> 34:05.600
<i>[man outside] Where the hell are you?!</i>

34:05.680 --> 34:07.880
<i>Jason, get your ass in here!</i>

34:08.000 --> 34:10.760
Your mom's had dinner on the
table for ten goddamn minutes!

34:13.400 --> 34:16.360
I'll save half my supper for you.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.560
Get in there, you little shit!

35:02.640 --> 35:05.160
You better wipe that look off your face.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.937
<i>- [knocking on door]
- It's open.</i>

35:22.480 --> 35:24.080
Missed you.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.600
Are you all right?

35:37.680 --> 35:39.840
Just tired.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.800
Long day.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.800
Irritating patients.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.800
- Everybody's got a problem.
- And?

35:47.760 --> 35:50.080
I know you think that Shelley's dead,

35:50.160 --> 35:52.560
but I can't help feeling
that she's still out there.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.360
She's been missing for so long.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.000
What is it you're always
telling your patients?

35:59.080 --> 36:02.440
Something about accepting
the things you can't change?

36:02.520 --> 36:04.400
Hmm.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.680
It's not knowing is the hard part.

36:10.040 --> 36:13.480
[sighs] Olivia...

36:14.400 --> 36:16.760
The sheriff dropped by today.

36:18.760 --> 36:23.440
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about Marie being here.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.360
I didn't think it was important.

36:25.440 --> 36:28.440
She went missing last night and you didn't
think it was important enough to mention?

36:28.560 --> 36:30.480
Why wouldn't you tell
me something like that?

36:30.560 --> 36:32.560
- I was trying to protect you.
- From what?

36:32.640 --> 36:34.000
She was angry. She...

36:34.080 --> 36:37.480
She said terrible things
about us, about you.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.520
- I didn't want to...
- What could she possibly say

36:39.600 --> 36:42.160
that I haven't already
heard? That I'm a cheater?

36:42.240 --> 36:44.880
- That I'm a bad person...
- She said that you killed Letha.

36:46.880 --> 36:50.240
She said that you were the one who
insisted Letha deliver at the White Tower

36:50.320 --> 36:55.320
instead of taking her to
her regular obstetrician.

36:55.400 --> 36:59.320
She said your decision cost Letha
and your granddaughter their lives.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.680
Marie wouldn't blame me.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.800
Why would I make that up?

37:15.320 --> 37:18.520
Why would I lie? Hmm?

37:18.600 --> 37:21.520
To tear her down?

37:21.600 --> 37:23.480
You're already mine.

37:28.200 --> 37:31.480
I know what it's like to have
someone you love disappoint you.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.080
I want to make it better.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.040
[both grunting]

38:09.640 --> 38:12.640
See, it's not about the money.

38:13.640 --> 38:18.760
I could wipe my ass with 20 grand
every Sunday for a month and not notice.

38:18.840 --> 38:22.280
No, this is about sending a message

38:22.360 --> 38:26.880
to my associates, present and future.

38:28.080 --> 38:32.880
If your performance is unsatisfactory,
there will be consequences.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.560
Are you familiar with the term ROI?

38:48.680 --> 38:50.600
Return on investment.

38:50.680 --> 38:55.520
See, I invested in you,
and you returned nothing,

38:55.640 --> 38:59.680
which is bad enough,
but you cost me capital.

38:59.800 --> 39:03.240
YCC. That will not stand.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.600
Now I'm gonna take something from you.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.600
[both grunting loudly]

39:08.680 --> 39:10.160
This is called an elastrator.

39:10.240 --> 39:13.520
It's used to remove the
testicles from pigs, bulls,

39:13.600 --> 39:16.640
various other farm animals,

39:16.720 --> 39:19.560
those I don't see fit to reproduce.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.680
Fairly simple process.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.240
Attach the rubber band.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.160
Alcohol to prevent infection.

39:28.240 --> 39:32.640
Now, you place the band over the nut sack,

39:32.720 --> 39:35.960
making sure the testicles
are below the ring.

39:36.040 --> 39:40.760
Once the circulation is cut off,
the testes die within minutes,

39:40.840 --> 39:45.240
eventually withering, turning
black, and falling off.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.720
- Shh, shh, shh, shh...
- [both grunting loudly]

39:49.800 --> 39:54.760
Now, I understand that from time to time

39:54.840 --> 39:57.280
people make mistakes,

39:57.360 --> 39:59.600
which is why I'm only taking one ball each.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.120
I believe in second chances. Mm-hm.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.320
[turns up TV]

40:08.400 --> 40:11.280
[indistinct narration on TV]

40:12.960 --> 40:15.040
[muffled shouting]

40:16.640 --> 40:18.720
[muffled screaming]

40:57.800 --> 41:00.680
What the fuck?

41:57.160 --> 41:59.880
[beeping]

42:12.440 --> 42:14.720
[beeping different combination]

42:20.680 --> 42:23.160
[baby crying]

42:30.135 --> 42:32.015
[crying stops]

42:32.095 --> 42:34.315
[babbles]

42:37.160 --> 42:38.640
[giggles]

43:04.040 --> 43:06.400
Hey, Leticia, it's Norman.

43:06.520 --> 43:10.400
Yeah. Hey, I know you have your
people out looking for my niece,

43:10.520 --> 43:13.080
but I was hoping you could
help me out with another matter.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.480
Well, right away, if you could.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.800
Thank you.

43:25.680 --> 43:30.320
<i>You two are the most prosperous people
I seen tonight. God's been good to you.</i>

43:30.400 --> 43:32.360
You can throw a little
bit of something my way?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.280
I hope you motherfuckers die of cancer!

43:38.560 --> 43:40.400
'Cause you will.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.320
[spits]

43:50.080 --> 43:53.040
[muttering]

43:55.200 --> 43:57.360
[coughing]

43:57.440 --> 43:59.600
Aw, fuck. Damn.

44:29.556 --> 44:31.556
[coughing]

44:35.376 --> 44:38.055
[humming]

45:06.680 --> 45:08.480
Do you have a family?

45:11.440 --> 45:13.520
Who the fuck are you?

45:13.640 --> 45:17.600
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I seen you earlier.

45:17.680 --> 45:19.760
You didn't give me shit.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.400
What, you some kind of
rich pervert, or what?

45:22.480 --> 45:26.400
I need to know. Do you have a family?

45:30.880 --> 45:35.080
I got a daughter. Won't talk to me.

45:35.160 --> 45:37.120
What the fuck business
is that of yours anyway?

45:37.200 --> 45:39.600
What's her name? Where does she live?

45:39.680 --> 45:41.960
I ain't telling you shit.

45:42.040 --> 45:45.600
I'm not gonna hurt her. I
promise. I want to help her.

45:51.520 --> 45:54.840
Melanie Haber. She's in Philly.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.360
I'll make sure she's well taken care of.

45:57.440 --> 46:00.400
Hey, hey, what... what the fuck, man?

46:00.480 --> 46:03.400
- What the fuck?
