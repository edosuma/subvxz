you like our tent.

10:40.573 --> 10:44.377
We think the great thing
is that because it roams
around the world,

10:44.377 --> 10:47.715
we get a different view
out of the big picture
windows every week.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.750
So this week,
obviously we've got

10:49.750 --> 10:51.118
the high desert
of California.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.254
- Next week, who knows?
- I do.

10:54.254 --> 10:58.325
Well, yes, James, we know.
It's Johannesburg.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.729
- Now they know.
- I know they know!
It doesn't matter!

11:01.729 --> 11:04.765
The point is the view changes
and so does the audience, okay?

11:04.765 --> 11:07.267
This week
you're all Americans.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.202
[CHEERING]

11:14.742 --> 11:17.077
Now, this is a bit
of a problem

11:17.077 --> 11:20.113
for people like us
who speak English.

11:20.113 --> 11:24.351
We can converse perfectly well
in a shop or a restaurant,

11:24.351 --> 11:27.054
but when it comes
to cars and motoring,

11:27.054 --> 11:29.857
every single word you use
is different.

11:29.857 --> 11:33.160
When I say "different,"
I mean "wrong."

11:33.160 --> 11:35.562
When you change gear
with a lever,
what do you call that?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.131
- Stick.
- Stick.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.133
Now, you see,
this is a stick.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.402
Couldn't change gear
with this.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.105
Wouldn't work.
What you can do with this
is point at things.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.140
Let's see
if we can get you educated.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.109
What do you call
this bit of a car?

11:49.109 --> 11:52.145
- ALL: The hood!
- MAN: Bonnet.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.681
- Bonnet.
- They're learning.

11:54.681 --> 11:57.785
What do you mean?
I know you can wear
a bonnet on your head.

11:57.785 --> 12:02.455
It's two things.
We're capable of having
those different thoughts.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.892
- What type
of vehicle is this?
- ALL: Pick-up.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.493
No, it's stupid.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.797
- Oh, now, hang on.
- It is stupid.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.132
Let's do another one of these.

12:12.132 --> 12:16.036
- What type
of vehicle is this?
- ALL: Coupe.

12:16.036 --> 12:20.073
Coupe? Coop is where
you keep your chickens.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.342
That's a coupé.
That's a French word, I admit.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.511
- Yeah, a bit.
- They're muddled with that.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.280
George Bush, have you heard what
he once said about the French?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.082
"The trouble with the French is
they have no word

12:29.082 --> 12:30.851
for entrepreneur."

12:32.252 --> 12:34.421
It is difficult. I think
the only thing we agree on

12:34.421 --> 12:36.656
- is "steering wheel."
- Yeah.

12:36.656 --> 12:40.861
But then they go and put it
on the wrong side of the car.

12:40.861 --> 12:45.298
It must be really annoying
having to drive along
like that all the time.

12:45.298 --> 12:49.002
Why don't you just put it
in front of the driver
like we do?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.438
It's probably a good idea
if we get on with
the actual show.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.841
Yes, it is. But we had
to clear all that up,

12:53.841 --> 12:56.176
because contrary to what
some people have been saying,

12:56.176 --> 12:58.578
this actually is a car show.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.314
- Well, not next week it isn't.
- Next week is an exception.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.116
- Yeah.
- But not when we go
to Barbados either.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.152
No, Barbados is definitely
another exception.

13:05.152 --> 13:08.989
But tonight couldn't be
more "car-y" if it tried.

13:08.989 --> 13:12.159
I'm gonna prove that point
because we're kicking off
with this.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.196
[LAUGHTER AND JEERING]

13:16.196 --> 13:19.132
Bear with me, bear with me--

13:19.132 --> 13:21.935
- I agree!
- [LAUGHTER]

13:21.935 --> 13:23.103
The thing is, though,

13:23.103 --> 13:25.505
various supercar makers
have now taken

13:25.505 --> 13:29.342
the polar-bear-friendly
technology from a Prius,

13:29.342 --> 13:33.146
and they are now using it
to create raw, naked speed.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.416
Now, I say the best
of these hybrid hypercars

13:36.416 --> 13:40.787
is the mad,
swivel-eyed McLaren P1.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.890
Whereas Richard Hammond,
who's wrong--

13:42.890 --> 13:43.991
I'm not wrong.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.259
He is, because he says
the best

13:46.259 --> 13:49.462
is actually the rather
boring Porsche 918.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.999
- It's not boring!
- Yes, it is.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.001
- It isn't.
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.535
It isn't.
Well, whatever.

13:55.535 --> 13:59.106
We decided to meet up
with the cars

13:59.106 --> 14:01.574
and settle this
once and for all.

14:59.332 --> 15:04.237
The location we chose
for this titanic duel
was Portugal...

15:04.237 --> 15:09.176
specifically,
the international
race track of the Algarve.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.318
When we arrived,
mechanics from Porsche

15:18.318 --> 15:20.453
and McLaren pounced on
our cars,

15:20.453 --> 15:23.523
fettling them for
what was to come.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.593
And this meant Hammond and I
had some time to indulge

15:26.593 --> 15:30.597
in a spot
of childish point scoring.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.833
Which one of these is going
to be the fastest around
this track?

15:33.833 --> 15:35.235
- This?
- Yeah.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.537
Apart from this one,
which will be faster.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.173
It won't. Which one do you
think will be the fastest?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.109
- This one.
- This one.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.412
Porsche think the Porsche
will be fastest.
McLaren say the McLaren.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.547
How much is it
if I wanted to buy one?

15:47.547 --> 15:50.583
I think one was sold in
an auction for 1.8 million.

15:50.583 --> 15:54.621
1.8 million dollars.
Hammond, how much is yours?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.623
838 euros.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.492
- Thousand I'm guessing?
- Yes. It is thousands.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.362
Why has your car
got a number on the side?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.397
It's the Weissach edition,
this one.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.433
- You also get
titanium chassis bolts.
- Stupid.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.568
For just an extra £60,000.

16:08.568 --> 16:12.405
And a carbon-fiber
bonnet strut.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.806

a carbon-fiber bonnet strut?

21:41.601 --> 21:43.870
Actually there is a bit more
to the Ferrari LaFerrari,

[CHEERING]

31:29.688 --> 31:32.024
We put a lot of work into that!

31:32.024 --> 31:35.962
It was really,
really hard doing that.

31:35.962 --> 31:39.365
Better than that, rather
brilliantly, we have made

31:39.365 --> 31:41.733
a bespoke version
of that sting

31:41.733 --> 31:43.269
for every single episode

31:43.269 --> 31:45.504
we're gonna make

[CHEERING]

31:49.641 --> 31:51.877
But hold on.
The slight problem with that

31:51.877 --> 31:53.712
is that we were
so busy doing that

31:53.712 --> 31:56.682
we didn't think actually
of anything to talk about.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.517
- We did.
- Yeah.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.752
- What?
- You'll love this.

32:00.752 --> 32:06.658
James May, the world's
slowest moving human being,

Actually charged
by the police.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.169
Criminal.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.704
He's actually quite proud of it.

32:18.704 --> 32:22.208
He did it on a Honda
CBR 600RR sports bike.

[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

32:27.613 --> 32:30.316
Richard and I were
genuinely astonished.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.750
He came into the office
and said,

32:31.750 --> 32:34.153
"I've been done
for speeding."

32:34.153 --> 32:37.123
Until we found out
how fast he was going.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.558
James, how fast was it again?

32:39.558 --> 32:42.161
37 miles an hour.

32:42.161 --> 32:45.397
Crazy! Mad man!

32:45.397 --> 32:48.467
How did you even breathe
at that kind of speed?

32:48.467 --> 32:51.503
How did the police catch you?
Were they running?

32:52.938 --> 32:55.374
Gentle jog for sure.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.409
The thing is,
if you've been caught,

32:57.409 --> 32:59.778
'cause we genuinely don't
believe anyone in the world has,

32:59.778 --> 33:04.583
but if you've been caught
speeding at a speed less
than 37,

33:04.583 --> 33:07.653

to us and let us know.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.688

it's possible.

- Whoa! Hang on a minute.
- What?

33:17.463 --> 33:18.830
The first-ever show,
and you just mock me

33:18.830 --> 33:21.300
for my speeding ticket
and then we move on?

33:21.300 --> 33:23.302
It's a busy show.

33:23.302 --> 33:26.372
It is a busy show.

about our track.

- Yes, we have one.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.378
This is the sort of place
where you can drive cars

33:32.378 --> 33:34.346
at speeds that you can do
on the road

33:34.346 --> 33:36.948
but only if you want
to go to prison afterwards.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.750
What, like 38 miles an hour?

33:38.750 --> 33:42.454
39 maybe even,
40 from time to time.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.423
Now, we were hoping
that we could bring it

33:44.423 --> 33:46.425
round the world with us
like the tent.

33:46.425 --> 33:50.229
But unfortunately
it's too heavy,

33:50.229 --> 33:53.099
and, as you are about to see,
too bitey.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.905
This is it.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.740
It's not a race circuit.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.843
It's not an airfield.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.379
It's not a road.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.716
What it is
is brilliant and fast.

34:11.950 --> 34:14.120
And extremely dangerous.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.823
It even looks dangerous
on a map.

34:17.823 --> 34:21.160

it's the exact same shape

34:21.160 --> 34:23.295

a performance benchmark.

First up,
it's the Isn't Straight,

34:45.951 --> 34:49.455
so called because
it isn't straight.

34:49.455 --> 34:53.959
There is a super-fast left
followed by a super-fast right.

34:53.959 --> 34:57.863
And if you make a mistake,
there's no run-off area
or Armco.

34:57.863 --> 35:01.167
It's just woods.

Woods that are full of wildlife

35:03.169 --> 35:05.871

on the Isn't Straight,

will be looking at your banner

We've called this section
Old Lady's House,

because it's right next
to a house

36:00.492 --> 36:04.129

and bumpy sprint

36:20.779 --> 36:23.515
to Sub Station.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.884
You need to get
this 90-left right,

36:25.884 --> 36:28.887
or you'll crash into
a cage full of electricity.

36:31.056 --> 36:34.360
And you'll need to get the
final 90-left right as well,

36:34.360 --> 36:36.928
or you'll run into
a field of sheep.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.001
So, trees, animals,

36:43.001 --> 36:44.936
a house, electricity,

36:44.936 --> 36:46.772
and because it's in England,

36:46.772 --> 36:48.940
usually quite a lot
of moisture in the air.

36:48.940 --> 36:53.345
It really is the most dangerous
track anywhere in the world.

To post a fast time here,

36:55.381 --> 36:59.017
you do need...

those.

37:06.758 --> 37:09.728
The car I've selected
for my first lap

37:09.728 --> 37:12.364
of the Eboladrome
is this.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.404
The BMW M2.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.987
Sadly, there isn't the time
in this, our first-ever show,

37:35.987 --> 37:39.558
to do a full road test
of this car,

37:39.558 --> 37:42.894
but there is time
to say that I think

37:42.894 --> 37:46.798
this is the best M car
BMW has ever made.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.381
In a lot of fast cars
these days,

38:02.381 --> 38:04.550
you get all sorts
of knobs and buttons

38:04.550 --> 38:07.353
which you can use
to change--

38:07.353 --> 38:08.654
I say change--
I mean ruin

38:08.654 --> 38:10.088
the characteristics
of the engine

38:10.088 --> 38:12.958
and the suspension
and the steering and so on.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.160
And I always think,
isn't that like a chef

38:15.160 --> 38:16.995
bringing a fish to your table

38:16.995 --> 38:19.598
and an oven and some butter
and a bit of parsley,

38:19.598 --> 38:21.600
and saying,
"Cook it yourself"? No.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.969
You cook it,
it's what I'm paying for.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.373
This car, happily,
has a more

38:27.373 --> 38:29.207
back-to-basics approach.

38:29.207 --> 38:32.043
In the M2, you get a little
rocker switch down here

38:32.043 --> 38:34.746
which does nothing at all

38:34.746 --> 38:37.849
as far as I can see,
and that's it.

38:37.849 --> 38:40.786
You're buying a car
which was set up at the factory

38:40.786 --> 38:44.490

what they're doing.

is enjoy it.

any understeer at all.

Oh, I made a mess of that.
But I'll just do this,

39:39.945 --> 39:42.614
and it'll look like
I did it on purpose.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.518
With the tires begging
for mercy,

39:46.518 --> 39:48.219
I got back onto the Isn't

39:48.219 --> 39:52.090
and unleashed
365 rampaging horsepowers

39:52.090 --> 39:55.761
from the turbo-charged
three-liter straight six.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.466
This isn't as fast
in a straight line

40:00.466 --> 40:03.234
as an M3,
but everywhere else...

40:03.234 --> 40:05.070
it is better.

40:05.070 --> 40:08.540
It feels less heavy,
less cumbersome.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.616
And due to the unique
characteristics
of our straight,

40:17.616 --> 40:20.552
I can tell the steering
is less...

40:20.552 --> 40:22.921
It's less twitchy.

40:27.593 --> 40:31.296
This track was designed
to trip cars up.

40:31.296 --> 40:33.465
There are fast corners,

40:33.465 --> 40:35.333
slow corners,

40:35.333 --> 40:37.836
drifty corners, and bumps.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.171
It's hard on the tires.

40:40.171 --> 40:43.775
It's hard on the brakes.
It's hard on the engine.

40:43.775 --> 40:47.546
It's point and squirt
and bark and yelp.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.681
It is vicious.

40:52.117 --> 40:56.855
But there is nothing here
which has flummoxed the M2.

40:56.855 --> 41:00.559
This thing is
an absolute masterpiece.

41:03.394 --> 41:06.532
Like I said,
it is the best M car

41:06.532 --> 41:08.233

41:11.236 --> 41:13.639
You may think
it's mad to suggest

41:13.639 --> 41:16.207
the cheapest M car
is the best,

41:16.207 --> 41:18.043
but look at it this way,

41:18.043 --> 41:21.379
this track is a lot cheaper
than Silverstone.

41:21.379 --> 41:24.182
And I know which one
I'd rather drive round.

Unbelievable.

41:38.463 --> 41:41.567
What?

41:41.567 --> 41:45.103
Why is there that zigzag
at Old Lady's House?

41:45.103 --> 41:47.272
- That wasn't there when I went.
- No, that wasn't.

41:47.272 --> 41:49.340
But after you'd left,
we discovered there is

41:49.340 --> 41:52.110
an unexploded Second
World War bomb, seriously,

41:52.110 --> 41:55.914
right where the track was,
so we had to go round it.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.448
- Fair enough.
- Let me get this right.

41:57.448 --> 42:01.219
At our track,
there's trees, animals,

42:01.219 --> 42:03.054
moisture, electricity,

42:03.054 --> 42:05.090
a house,
and an unexploded bomb?

42:05.090 --> 42:08.026
Yeah. Like I said, it's
the most dangerous track
in the world.

42:08.026 --> 42:12.030
Honestly, it makes Imola
look like a duvet. Honestly.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.801
Anyway, all the cars that
we test at the Eboladrome

42:15.801 --> 42:17.636
will do a timed lap.

42:17.636 --> 42:20.205
And to make sure it's
a completely level
playing field,

42:20.205 --> 42:24.175
they will all be driven
by the same racing driver.

42:24.175 --> 42:26.011
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

42:26.011 --> 42:28.246
We thought about this.
We gave it some thought.

42:28.246 --> 42:30.148
How clever is that? Now...

42:30.148 --> 42:31.617
[LAUGHTER]

42:31.617 --> 42:33.985
The thing is,
Amazon insisted

42:33.985 --> 42:35.621
that the racing driver
in question

42:35.621 --> 42:37.656
should be from this side
of the pond.

42:37.656 --> 42:41.727
So we went to something
called NASCAR?

42:41.727 --> 42:44.362
And we found one.
We shipped him to England

42:44.362 --> 42:47.633
and then we introduced him
to the complicated procedure

42:47.633 --> 42:51.502
which involves turning right.

42:51.502 --> 42:52.904
He's called Mike Skinner,

42:52.904 --> 42:55.506
but we know him simply as
"the American."

42:55.506 --> 42:57.208
We should warn you

42:57.208 --> 43:00.178
that some of his views
are quite strong.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.881
Yes, he has very specific
views, for example,

43:02.881 --> 43:05.283
on cars that have engines
with fewer than eight cylinders.

43:05.283 --> 43:07.485
- Communist.
- Or more than eight cylinders.

43:07.485 --> 43:10.722
- Communist.
- Or cars that have
their engine in the middle.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.724
Communist.

43:12.724 --> 43:15.827
Everything that isn't American
really with a V8 is communist.

43:15.827 --> 43:18.897
So let's see how he gets on
with the M2.

43:18.897 --> 43:20.932
There he is.

43:20.932 --> 43:23.268
Looking utterly bewildered.

43:25.003 --> 43:28.306
But he's off.
A skitter of a wheel spin.

43:28.306 --> 43:30.742
And immediately
he's onto the Isn't Straight.

43:30.742 --> 43:33.211
There is a right there
that will have confused him.

43:33.211 --> 43:34.746
Now a left,
he'll be good at that.

43:34.746 --> 43:35.781
Now he can open the taps.

43:35.781 --> 43:40.251
Three liters, six cylinders.

43:40.251 --> 43:41.953
This thing wouldn't pull
a greasy string

43:41.953 --> 43:43.855
out of a dog's ass.

43:43.855 --> 43:48.727
JEREMY: I've literally no
idea what he's talking about.

43:48.727 --> 43:51.462
Where I come from,
this ain't a car.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.699
It's a cry for help.

43:53.699 --> 43:55.533
JEREMY: Whatever.

43:55.533 --> 43:57.903
He's through the final corner
on the Isn't Straight.

43:57.903 --> 44:00.706
Into Your Name Here.
Hard on the brakes.

44:00.706 --> 44:02.708
Grabbing the stick,

44:02.708 --> 44:04.710
which is on the left-hand
side of where he's sitting,

44:04.710 --> 44:06.177
and turning in.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.379
See what I mean?
No understeer at all.

44:08.379 --> 44:10.481
Damn tracks are narrower
than my driveway.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.284
Yeah, that's 'cause it doesn't
have a monster truck on it.

44:13.284 --> 44:17.155
Wonder which one of them
came up with this thing.

44:17.155 --> 44:20.358
The tall one? The short one?
Or the one with the girly hair?

44:20.358 --> 44:23.561
JEREMY: Okay, coming up
to Old Lady's House.

44:23.561 --> 44:25.030
Hard on the brakes.

44:25.030 --> 44:27.933
Turning in, round
the unexploded bomb,

44:27.933 --> 44:30.568
and now opening
the taps again.

44:30.568 --> 44:33.104
No turbo lag at all,

44:33.104 --> 44:35.506
as he hammers down
the bumpy back straight

44:35.506 --> 44:37.342
towards Sub Station.

44:37.342 --> 44:39.177
This is a 90-left,

44:39.177 --> 44:41.046
new Tarmac
but it held it well.

44:41.046 --> 44:44.082
One more 90-left to go
through Field Of Sheep.

44:44.082 --> 44:47.185
And he's done it well.
And across the line.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.120
[CHEERING]

44:50.956 --> 44:53.624
First one. That's good.

44:53.624 --> 44:55.193
He's great.

44:55.193 --> 44:58.163
He's great going
left and right. Amazing.

44:58.163 --> 45:00.031
To make sure that the M2--

45:00.031 --> 45:02.968
that wasn't on the lap board
all by itself,

45:02.968 --> 45:06.004
we got the American to put
other benchmark cars--

45:06.004 --> 45:10.141
we call them benchmark cars,
he calls them communist--

45:10.141 --> 45:12.177
around the track,
to see what's what.

45:12.177 --> 45:14.112
There they all are:
McLaren, Audi and so forth.

45:14.112 --> 45:16.314
Hang on a minute.
We saw a Ferrari 488

45:16.314 --> 45:17.783
at the track
in the film earlier on.

45:17.783 --> 45:19.017
Why isn't that on there?

45:19.017 --> 45:21.186
Because Ferrari
wouldn't let us time it.

45:21.186 --> 45:23.088
- Wouldn't let us?
- No.

45:23.088 --> 45:25.791
So the Ferrari LaFerrari
can't go on the road

45:25.791 --> 45:28.259
- or run on electric only?
- No.

45:28.259 --> 45:30.128
And the 488
can't do a timed lap?

45:30.128 --> 45:32.663
Ferrari are quite tricky to
deal with from time to time.

45:32.663 --> 45:35.901
Let's just put it that way
and move on. It's time to see

45:35.901 --> 45:38.236
where the M2 goes
on that board.

45:38.236 --> 45:41.072
Let's have a look.
Let's put it on.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.308
- Oh!
- RICHARD: Ha-ha!

45:43.308 --> 45:44.976
Wow! Wow!

45:44.976 --> 45:48.814
"I think it's the best M car
they've ever made."

45:50.448 --> 45:52.517
Not my words.

45:52.517 --> 45:54.853
"I prefer it to all the others
that are quicker than it."

45:54.853 --> 45:57.823
- Yes, it's--
- The one you should have,

45:57.823 --> 46:00.091
if you want one that's slower
than all the other M cars.

46:00.091 --> 46:02.427
It's better.
It's only two seconds--

46:02.427 --> 46:05.396
- It's quicker than a Civic.
- Yeah.

46:05.396 --> 46:07.032
But it's slower than--

46:07.032 --> 46:08.834
If you had a choice
of M cars, lined them up,

46:08.834 --> 46:11.302
and said,
"I'd like the fastest,"
it wouldn't be that one.

46:11.302 --> 46:14.739
- Shut up.
- Better in every single way?

46:14.739 --> 46:17.208
- You said that.
- I don't care.
Have you driven one?

46:17.208 --> 46:20.178
- I have.
- It's fabulous.

46:20.178 --> 46:22.848
It's a brilliant car.
It really honestly is.

46:22.848 --> 46:25.951
It's a shame we can't take
the track round the world
with us.

46:25.951 --> 46:29.087
Because if we did, we could
invite celebrities to drive
round it

46:29.087 --> 46:31.122
and we could keep
a score sheet

46:31.122 --> 46:33.358
of who was the fastest.

46:33.358 --> 46:35.393
[LAUGHTER]

46:35.393 --> 46:36.862
No, I don't like it!

46:36.862 --> 46:38.596
I don't like it, no.

46:38.596 --> 46:41.166
- I don't think it would work.
- Nobody wants to watch that.

46:41.166 --> 46:44.102
I'm not sure that they do.
Anyway, we've got a better idea,

46:44.102 --> 46:46.137
Okay, for our celebrities.

46:46.137 --> 46:49.207
We're calling it
Celebrity Brain Crash,

46:49.207 --> 46:51.542
and we had a sting made
for that as well.

46:58.984 --> 47:02.020
That is terrible.

47:02.020 --> 47:04.255
I don't like to use this...

47:04.255 --> 47:05.891
[CHEERING]

47:07.558 --> 47:09.928
RICHARD: It's just terrible.

47:09.928 --> 47:13.899
Who is gonna say,
"I'm gonna watch that
new Amazon car show.

47:13.899 --> 47:16.634
Henry VIII's head explodes"?

47:16.634 --> 47:20.105
Why is there smoke coming out
of Brad Pitt's head?

47:20.105 --> 47:22.640
What are we trying to say?

47:22.640 --> 47:24.609
- No, we're not.
- No, we're not saying that.

47:25.911 --> 47:27.812
Not that.

47:27.812 --> 47:29.647
That is a terrible sting,

47:29.647 --> 47:32.717
but the machine itself
isn't terrible at all.

47:32.717 --> 47:35.686
It's used to measure
somebody's mental agility,

47:35.686 --> 47:37.522
their observational skills

47:37.522 --> 47:40.191
and their ability
to multi-task.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.227
It's actually based
on a machine

47:42.227 --> 47:44.262
that's used
to test fighter pilots

47:44.262 --> 47:46.297
who want to join
the Royal Air Force

47:46.297 --> 47:49.200

finest and greatest air force

[UPROAR, CHEERING]

48:07.785 --> 48:09.620
I'll hold myself back here.

48:09.620 --> 48:13.391
Now, hold on. You lot can
grumble as much as you like,

48:13.391 --> 48:16.394
but we edit this show
and we're British,

48:16.394 --> 48:18.396
so you'll just get cut out.

48:18.396 --> 48:21.566
- [BOOING]
- We're all in agreement.

48:21.566 --> 48:25.770
That the Royal Air Force is
better than the US Air Force.

48:31.809 --> 48:35.480
the Royal Air Force is better

[JEERING]

48:38.416 --> 48:40.751
We're all now in agreement.

The Royal Air Force is--

48:42.520 --> 48:44.522
is the best air force
in the world.

48:44.522 --> 48:46.591
[BOOING]

48:46.591 --> 48:50.061
So we're all in agreement
the Royal Air Force
is quite good.

- That will do. That will do.

48:52.998 --> 48:56.701

to Celebrity Brain Crash

48:56.701 --> 48:58.636
and meet our first-ever guest.

48:58.636 --> 49:00.471
Normally on other shows,

49:00.471 --> 49:02.507
the guest will come through
a sparkly curtain,

49:02.507 --> 49:05.810
wave a bit and then sit down,
but not here.

49:05.810 --> 49:09.614
Oh, yes, our guests
make a proper arrival.

49:09.614 --> 49:12.750
And on that note,
let's meet tonight's star.

49:12.750 --> 49:15.420
He has been in pretty much

49:15.420 --> 49:18.256
every single movie franchise
there is

49:18.256 --> 49:20.291
apart from Bridget Jones.

49:20.291 --> 49:22.293
No, he was Bridget Jones.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.562
- Was he?
- No.

49:24.562 --> 49:27.498
But it doesn't matter.
He was in the Bourne  films.

49:27.498 --> 49:29.200
He was in the
Mission Impossible films,

49:29.200 --> 49:30.568
the Avengers films,

49:30.568 --> 49:34.139
and right now
he is 10,000 feet above us,

49:34.139 --> 49:36.707

one hell of an entrance.

That is amazing

50:01.599 --> 50:03.401
to see him doing
his own stunts.

50:03.401 --> 50:06.937

And he is looking good!

50:06.937 --> 50:09.006
When he gets here,

50:09.006 --> 50:11.709
I do want to talk to him
about that Bourne Legacy
film.

50:11.709 --> 50:14.445

50:44.875 --> 50:47.812
No, James, he's not.

50:47.812 --> 50:51.116
It's okay, though.
We anticipated
this sort of thing,

50:51.116 --> 50:53.151
so we got
a back-up guest ready.

50:53.151 --> 50:55.186
Uh...

50:55.186 --> 50:57.555
He was in Man From Uncle.

50:57.555 --> 51:00.991
He was in Lone Ranger.
He was both twins

51:00.991 --> 51:02.760
in The Social Network.

51:02.760 --> 51:05.530
And his new film is called
Nocturnal Animals.

51:05.530 --> 51:07.565
We haven't had time,
unfortunately,

51:07.565 --> 51:09.500
to organize
a dramatic entrance,

51:09.500 --> 51:12.337
but I hope you'll give him
a warm welcome nevertheless.

51:22.680 --> 51:24.482
Is that a snake?

- It's a snake.
- That's a rattlesnake.

51:26.384 --> 51:28.386
- Is it?
- Yeah.

51:28.386 --> 51:31.289
He's being killed.
Quiet, everyone.

51:31.289 --> 51:33.324
Quiet, please.

51:33.324 --> 51:35.360
There's literally
nothing we can do.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.395
He's yards away from us.

51:37.395 --> 51:39.063
Snakes are like herds
of them.

51:39.063 --> 51:41.766
- They hunt in packs.
- Yeah, they're pack animals.

51:41.766 --> 51:44.535
Does that mean
he's not coming on either?

51:44.535 --> 51:47.805
No, James, he's finished
writhing around in agony.

51:47.805 --> 51:49.840
And now he's dead.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.876
So that is a no.

51:51.876 --> 51:53.711
Well, uh...

in the audience.

from an air show nearby

can she come to the show?

We began by lining up

53:51.629 --> 53:54.365
the three most exciting cars
on the planet

53:54.365 --> 53:58.002
for the drag race
of all drag races.

54:12.016 --> 54:15.686
Naturally, this meant
engaging launch control,

54:15.686 --> 54:20.024
which in the McLaren
takes about a fortnight.

54:20.024 --> 54:24.094
I have to have the drive tray
in track mode,

54:24.094 --> 54:26.331
the aero package
in sport mode,

54:26.331 --> 54:27.665
so that the rear end squats

54:27.665 --> 54:29.634
when I set off
and gives me more traction.

54:29.634 --> 54:32.870
I have to have the DRS
button pressed with my thumb

54:32.870 --> 54:36.874
to keep the rear wing open
which reduces drag obviously.

54:36.874 --> 54:39.977
Launch control in the Porsche,
left foot on the brake hard.

54:39.977 --> 54:42.012
Right foot
on the throttle hard.

54:42.012 --> 54:44.349
Light goes green, left foot
off brake. Pa-ching!

54:44.349 --> 54:46.751
Launch button,
press for two seconds.

54:46.751 --> 54:49.520
Left foot on brake.
Right foot on throttle.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.956
Press launch control,
mash the throttle,

54:51.956 --> 54:54.759
within four seconds
release the brake.

54:54.759 --> 54:57.995
Three seconds later,
I have full boost,

54:57.995 --> 55:00.431
and I have to set off
within three seconds

55:00.431 --> 55:02.833
or the entire system
disengages.

55:02.833 --> 55:05.603
I'm going to get this wrong.

55:05.603 --> 55:07.638
Just so you know.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.940
I've got a lot to do in here.

55:13.411 --> 55:15.713
[REVVING]

55:32.930 --> 55:34.832
[BEEP]

55:36.401 --> 55:39.169
I wasn't ready.

55:39.169 --> 55:41.939
Oh, my God!
That is quick!

55:45.810 --> 55:49.947
Holy mother!
Did you see that?

55:49.947 --> 55:53.183
[BLEEP] me!
Jesus [BLEEP] Christ!

55:53.183 --> 55:55.119
It's all over the place.

56:00.458 --> 56:03.060
Since it was clear I'd got
all my buttons wrong,

56:03.060 --> 56:06.497
the chaps agreed
to another run.

56:06.497 --> 56:08.533
Sit rep,
the lights went green

56:08.533 --> 56:10.601
before the boost was ready,

56:10.601 --> 56:12.770
and I had the DRS button
still pressed

56:12.770 --> 56:15.440
when I got to the end,
which meant I had no downforce,

56:15.440 --> 56:18.643
which meant--
Well, poo came out.

56:18.643 --> 56:22.713
This time I'm gonna do it
with more drag,

56:22.713 --> 56:25.315
which will slow me down,
but I will be able to stop

56:25.315 --> 56:27.452
without killing myself.

56:29.454 --> 56:32.457
[REVVING]

56:32.457 --> 56:34.559

56:39.196 --> 56:41.566
JEREMY: Boost building.

56:44.368 --> 56:46.504
Three, two...

56:50.475 --> 56:52.543
And we are away!
What a start!

56:55.312 --> 56:57.715
The Porsche has got off
to a flyer.

56:59.216 --> 57:01.151
Oh, balls!

57:02.620 --> 57:04.889
180, 190, 210.

57:06.691 --> 57:08.726
230 kilometers an hour.

57:14.198 --> 57:16.967
That wasn't very good.

57:16.967 --> 57:20.204
Because James had
somehow messed up that time,

57:20.204 --> 57:22.673
and because this test
was about the cars,

57:22.673 --> 57:25.209
we decided to go again.

57:30.347 --> 57:31.782
It's a rocket ship.

57:33.518 --> 57:35.620
For England!

57:37.254 --> 57:38.989
No, no!

57:44.729 --> 57:46.997
Okay, we have all three
won this now.

57:49.634 --> 57:51.902
JEREMY: Determined
to find a definitive

57:51.902 --> 57:55.405

finishing order,

57:55.405 --> 57:57.274
we ran again.

57:57.274 --> 57:59.209
[BEEP]

58:02.212 --> 58:06.216
Another totally different
result there, gentlemen.

58:07.384 --> 58:08.819
And again.

58:11.956 --> 58:15.760
That's a different result
again.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.895
JEREMY: And again?

58:23.100 --> 58:25.369
At this point,
we decided to call

58:25.369 --> 58:26.937
a halt to proceedings,

58:26.937 --> 58:31.609
because we had reached
a scientific conclusion.

58:31.609 --> 58:35.045
It turns out it doesn't really
matter which car you buy,

58:35.045 --> 58:37.281
it all depends on your shoes.

58:37.281 --> 58:38.983
Now, this is a TOD loafer.

58:38.983 --> 58:42.052
Slightly worn
to get a crisper jump

58:42.052 --> 58:44.254
off the brake pedal,
and it's immediate.

58:44.254 --> 58:47.191
- This is a Converse.
- There's more sponge
in there than I thought.

58:47.191 --> 58:50.160
See, Adidas, they weren't
thinking that through.

58:50.160 --> 58:53.330
- So, as you lift
your foot up--
- It's a millisecond.

58:53.330 --> 58:54.699
I know you've got KERS,

58:54.699 --> 58:56.266
I know you've got
a 6.3-litre V12,

58:56.266 --> 58:58.836
and I know that launch
control system is amazing,

58:58.836 --> 59:00.237
but it's all let down

59:00.237 --> 59:02.206
by the sponginess
of the Adidas shoe.

59:02.206 --> 59:04.441
So they should sell you
the car and the shoes.

59:04.441 --> 59:06.977
No, have you got the correct
shoes and have you worn them in?

59:06.977 --> 59:09.013
- Exactly.
- Fresh shoes, lads.

59:09.013 --> 59:13.217
- I just need to--
- You need to skid about.
There we go.

59:13.217 --> 59:15.820
With that sorted,

59:15.820 --> 59:18.055
it was time to bring in
a racing driver

59:18.055 --> 59:21.926
to see which of our cars
could do the fastest lap.

59:21.926 --> 59:25.262
Our resident American
said he wasn't interested,

59:25.262 --> 59:28.265
because all three cars
are probably communist.

59:28.265 --> 59:31.636
So instead, we went
for a Belgian chap--

59:31.636 --> 59:33.170
[GUNFIRE]

59:33.170 --> 59:36.807
...who's done Formula One
and Formula E,

59:36.807 --> 59:39.343
Jerome d'Ambrosio.

59:44.314 --> 59:46.016
Jerome took the cars out

59:46.016 --> 59:48.686
to get a sense of how
they handled.

1:00:05.002 --> 1:00:06.837
And when he'd finished,

1:00:06.837 --> 1:00:08.639
we were interested to hear

1:00:08.639 --> 1:00:10.607
his professional opinion.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:12.943
[SPEAKS FRENCH]

1:00:54.785 --> 1:00:57.421
RICHARD: At this point,
word reached us that Jeremy

1:00:57.421 --> 1:01:01.091
was taking liberties
with the subtitling machine.

1:01:02.459 --> 1:01:05.429
So we moved on
to the big event:

1:01:05.429 --> 1:01:08.098
the timed laps.

1:01:13.437 --> 1:01:15.472
Once the mechanics had
finished their preparations,

1:01:15.472 --> 1:01:18.408
the three speed traps
were activated.

1:01:21.879 --> 1:01:24.548
And the Ferrari LaFerrari
took its place

1:01:24.548 --> 1:01:27.051
on the start line.

1:01:28.185 --> 1:01:30.220
Look how good it looks there.

1:01:30.220 --> 1:01:33.557
This is just wasting time.
It's wasting rubber and fuel.

1:01:33.557 --> 1:01:35.392
No, this is like
an amuse-bouche.

1:01:35.392 --> 1:01:39.096
Yeah, it is. You have ordered
the duck and sherry trifle.

1:01:39.096 --> 1:01:42.833
- And you're a melon ball.
- I'm not even listening.

Gentlemen, it is doing
231.4 kilometers an hour

1:02:03.453 --> 1:02:05.589
at the end of the straight.

1:02:05.589 --> 1:02:09.193
It's about the same speed
as a Golf diesel,
something like that.

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:26.276
194.9.

1:02:26.276 --> 1:02:28.112

1:02:28.112 --> 1:02:30.314
- Is he stopping off
for shopping?
- He must be.

1:02:45.963 --> 1:02:48.098
Here he is.

1:02:54.604 --> 1:02:59.343
- James, if you want
to get a cup of tea.
- We've warmed the track.

1:02:59.343 --> 1:03:03.848
RICHARD: Next it was the turn
of the Porsche 918.

1:03:03.848 --> 1:03:06.350
How much faster will it go
because of the stripes?

1:03:06.350 --> 1:03:07.351
Much.

1:03:22.299 --> 1:03:24.134
231 point...

1:03:24.134 --> 1:03:26.170
So he's faster
than the Ferrari.

RICHARD: 183.0.

1:03:38.182 --> 1:03:41.785
Way, way,
way slower than him.

Don't forget between here
and the next measuring point,

1:03:43.921 --> 1:03:46.590
Okay, you've got
four slow corners,

1:03:46.590 --> 1:03:49.259
and those are the ones
where the Porsche
is gonna make up time.

1:03:51.161 --> 1:03:52.362
Because of the
four-wheel steering.

1:03:52.362 --> 1:03:56.033
- Like a Honda Prelude?
- No!

- 110 point what?
- One.

of a kilometer an hour,

the turn of the psycho killer.

The trickiest,
the edgiest of the three.

1:04:37.541 --> 1:04:39.443
But I was so confident
it'd win,

1:04:39.443 --> 1:04:43.047
I was prepared
to take a massive gamble.

If the McLaren
isn't the fastest,

- Yup.

You said it would mince
the Porsche.

1:09:00.404 --> 1:09:03.207
the fastest,
but it's not the fastest.

1:09:03.207 --> 1:09:05.209
It's the slowest!

1:09:05.209 --> 1:09:08.445
Ladies and gentlemen,
journalist, broadcaster

1:09:08.445 --> 1:09:11.881
and homeless man,
Jeremy Clarkson.

1:09:11.881 --> 1:09:13.817
[CHEERING]

1:09:18.788 --> 1:09:23.560
That's what it is.
That's what it is.

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:26.363
You're not really going
to knock my house down?

1:09:26.363 --> 1:09:28.865
Yes, we are.

1:09:28.865 --> 1:09:30.900
- A bet is a bet.
- That's the deal.

1:09:30.900 --> 1:09:33.637
- And we're going to film it.
- No, but the thing is,

1:09:33.637 --> 1:09:36.240
on the tires that the
McLaren can be bought with,

1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:38.575
it was faster.

1:09:38.575 --> 1:09:40.277
We agreed right at the start

1:09:40.277 --> 1:09:43.380
we'd all run on
the same tires.

1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:45.849
That was the deal
before your car lost.

1:09:45.849 --> 1:09:47.384
So let's just...

1:09:47.384 --> 1:09:50.887
Let's just sum this
first show up, shall we?

1:09:50.887 --> 1:09:52.722
I've lost my house.

1:09:52.722 --> 1:09:55.091
- We've had a fight
with the audience.
- Big one.

1:09:55.091 --> 1:09:57.961
Somebody shot our drone down.

1:09:57.961 --> 1:10:00.664
And we've killed three
quite major celebrities.

1:10:00.664 --> 1:10:02.699
Yeah, but on the plus side,

1:10:02.699 --> 1:10:04.901
my Porsche was the fastest!

1:10:04.901 --> 1:10:06.370
[CHEERING]

1:10:10.407 --> 1:10:12.576
And on that terrible
disappointment,

1:10:12.576 --> 1:10:14.678
I'm afraid it's time to end.

1:10:14.678 --> 1:10:16.480
Thank you all very much
for coming.

1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:18.014
Thank you for watching.

1:10:18.014 --> 1:10:19.883
And we'll see you next week
in Johannesburg.

1:10:19.883 --> 1:10:21.285
Good-bye!

1:10:21.285 --> 1:10:22.952
[CHEERING]

1:10:28.024 --> 1:10:30.427
♫ Oh, sunshiney day ♫

1:10:32.496 --> 1:10:36.466
♫ Gonna be a bright
sunshiney day ♫

1:10:39.836 --> 1:10:42.672
♫ Bright sunshiney day ♫

1:10:45.809 --> 1:10:48.878
♫ Bright sunshiney day ♫

1:10:51.715 --> 1:10:55.452
