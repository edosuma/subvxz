00:00.277 --> 00:01.710
Previously
on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.908 --> 00:04.942
Artie says that H.G. Wells
is actually...

00:05.010 --> 00:06.510
A woman.

00:06.578 --> 00:08.612
I was apprenticed
at Warehouse 12.

00:08.680 --> 00:10.180
Then who is H.G. Wells?

00:10.248 --> 00:12.404
My brother Charles
was the writer.

00:12.472 --> 00:14.461
I supplied the ideas.

00:14.526 --> 00:15.990
My machine allows your mind

00:16.058 --> 00:17.558
to inhabit the body
of someone in the past.

00:21.008 --> 00:23.176
- We're in 1961.
- Uh-huh.

00:23.243 --> 00:27.506
- Check it out, we're...
- Jack and Rebecca.

00:48.991 --> 00:51.562
Oh, I do beg your pardon.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.565
Best mind where
you're walking, gov'ner.

00:53.633 --> 00:55.501
Morning light can
play tricks on you.

00:55.569 --> 00:58.605
Yes, yes, yes.
Mustn't be late.

01:06.282 --> 01:07.917
Oh.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.285
Weren't we supposed to meet
at the Observatory?

01:10.353 --> 01:13.388
Your note said you found
the perfect source of--

01:13.456 --> 01:17.024
I say,
what the devil is...

01:21.895 --> 01:23.395
Police!

01:37.941 --> 01:40.676
There you are,
Mr. Blue-Winged Warbler.

01:40.744 --> 01:42.478
Doug Varley,
you've done it again.

01:42.546 --> 01:45.248
Get to check you off
my life list.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.491
Oh. Mmm.

02:31.558 --> 02:32.992
Would you like some
whipped cream for your pie?

02:33.060 --> 02:34.961
Oh, naughty, naughty.

02:37.564 --> 02:38.697
Mmm.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.466
What?
The power's out,

02:42.534 --> 02:43.901
and the banana cream pie
goes bad.

02:43.969 --> 02:46.069
I didn't eat the crust,
just the healthy part.

02:46.137 --> 02:48.071
You got to ride
in the Cherry Picker!

02:48.139 --> 02:49.906
Well, I was investigating.

02:49.974 --> 02:52.108
So did you find out
anything here,

02:52.176 --> 02:55.278
you know, other than what
warm lemon meringue tastes like?

02:55.346 --> 02:58.782
Oh, actually,
Pammy said that

02:58.850 --> 03:00.317
just before the power
went out,

03:00.385 --> 03:02.586
she heard kind of like
a horn sound.

03:02.654 --> 03:04.021
But I still don't see
how it matters.

03:04.089 --> 03:05.656
It was just lightning.

03:05.724 --> 03:08.626
Is this gonna hold up us
getting our power back on?

03:08.694 --> 03:09.994
Uh, no, no.

03:10.062 --> 03:13.398
They should have it
back up and running soon.

03:13.466 --> 03:15.033
Okay, it wasn't
just lightning.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.267
The body was
completely disintegrated.

03:16.335 --> 03:18.602
Right, and took half
the billboard with it.

03:18.670 --> 03:21.171
What was weird is that the
edge of the billboard was worn,

03:21.239 --> 03:22.706
almost like it was
in a sandstorm.

03:22.774 --> 03:25.208
Okay, so something
sand-related.

03:25.276 --> 03:28.745
Um...Sands of Iwo Jima.

03:28.813 --> 03:32.715
Annette Funicello's
beach ball.

03:32.783 --> 03:34.783
I have an idea,
but you're not gonna like it.

03:36.853 --> 03:38.120
Frankie Avalon?

03:39.356 --> 03:40.489
Why don't you trust me?

03:40.557 --> 03:41.490
It's the kind of thing
we should have

03:41.558 --> 03:42.892
agreed upon first.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.994
Each of us should have
veto power.

03:45.062 --> 03:46.596
Artie will agree with me,
right, Artie?

03:46.664 --> 03:48.398
One, I have veto power
over both of you.

03:48.465 --> 03:49.732
And two,

03:49.800 --> 03:52.235
the Regents have already
decided to allow it,

03:52.303 --> 03:54.203
so let it go.
They said that we can do it?

03:54.271 --> 03:56.373
It is done.

04:03.515 --> 04:05.950
You're right, Myka...

04:06.017 --> 04:07.684
I do know what this is.

04:22.933 --> 04:24.667
I must have started
drinking again

04:24.735 --> 04:27.570
because the woman who tried
to activate a supervolcano

04:27.638 --> 04:29.205
with a giant fork
is standing here,

04:29.273 --> 04:31.074
and you're all acting like
it's a potluck.

04:31.142 --> 04:32.809
No. No, no, no, no.
Pete, H.G.'s not really here.

04:32.877 --> 04:34.178
She's a hologram.

04:34.245 --> 04:37.481
That thing on Artie's desk
is projecting her.

04:37.549 --> 04:38.916
Couldn't hurt a fly.

04:38.984 --> 04:42.186
Pretty snazzy,
if you ask me.

04:42.253 --> 04:44.054
I mean, if she wasn't
a volcano-causing super villain,

04:44.122 --> 04:45.722
like you said.

04:45.790 --> 04:46.891
Look, when H.G.
first showed up,

04:46.958 --> 04:48.592
I read her files
from Warehouse 12.

04:48.660 --> 04:50.761
I remember a case
with the same details.

04:50.829 --> 04:52.062
You have my word, Pete.

04:52.130 --> 04:53.597
My only intention is
to help.

04:53.665 --> 04:56.866
Oh, 'cause your word means
so much around here.

04:56.934 --> 05:00.470
I'm quite glad
to see you here, Myka.

05:00.537 --> 05:03.572
I'd like to think I had
something to do with that.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.840
Yeah, no ego there.

05:04.908 --> 05:06.775
You know, it's a shame
Jinksy isn't here

05:06.843 --> 05:08.243
to see the <i>freak show.</i>

05:08.311 --> 05:10.712
Oh, is there
a new recruit?

05:10.780 --> 05:13.081
He's on personal leave in--

05:13.149 --> 05:14.850
hands off!

05:14.918 --> 05:16.485
Oh, I don't know
if you've heard.

05:16.554 --> 05:17.921
I can't actually
touch anything

05:17.989 --> 05:19.523
in my current
holographic state.

05:19.591 --> 05:21.258
How is your shoulder feeling,
by the way?

05:21.326 --> 05:22.926
Like you shot it.

05:22.994 --> 05:25.429
- Technically, you did that.
- Yeah. Moving on.

05:25.497 --> 05:27.298
Like it or not, we're gonna
have to use her help.

05:27.366 --> 05:29.334
The billboard worker
is not the first death.

05:29.401 --> 05:31.369
Yeah, day before yesterday,
a painter disappeared

05:31.437 --> 05:32.671
from the top
of the Fort Pitt Bridge.

05:32.738 --> 05:33.872
The police thought he fell
into the river--

05:33.940 --> 05:35.340
They're not gonna find
his body.

05:35.408 --> 05:37.041
The witnesses heard
exactly the same noise

05:37.109 --> 05:38.142
as that waitress.

05:38.210 --> 05:39.610
Did you check
the traffic cams?

05:39.678 --> 05:41.546
The bridge was out,
and we've tried to find links

05:41.613 --> 05:44.582
between the victims, locations,
witnesses--we got nothing.

05:44.649 --> 05:48.185
People are dying, Pete.
We need to know what she knows.

05:48.253 --> 05:50.154
All right,
so here are the rules.

05:50.221 --> 05:52.556
You get to enjoy
this change of scenery

05:52.624 --> 05:54.358
exactly as long as
you are helping us.

05:54.426 --> 05:56.962
The second that that is over,
you go back to your...

05:57.029 --> 05:59.565
- Limbo prison?
- Mm-hmm.

05:59.633 --> 06:02.268
Understood.

06:02.336 --> 06:03.403
Tell us what you know.

06:06.107 --> 06:08.309
Righty-o, then.

06:08.377 --> 06:11.846
It was 1893.

06:11.914 --> 06:15.550
Christina had been gone
for nearly two years by now.

06:24.794 --> 06:28.029
Once again, my brother was
basking in my glory.

06:28.097 --> 06:30.231
Oh, you're wonderful,
Mr. Wells.

06:30.299 --> 06:31.633
Oh, you're too kind.

06:31.701 --> 06:34.670
My stories are
but the simple musings

06:34.737 --> 06:38.808
of a humble man cursed
with too much imagination...

06:40.811 --> 06:41.945
And terribly good looks.

06:45.584 --> 06:48.386
Helen.

06:48.454 --> 06:52.124
Your brother, he's as charming
as he is brilliant.

06:52.192 --> 06:54.426
I couldn't agree more.

06:54.494 --> 06:56.361
Where does he get
his ideas?

06:56.429 --> 06:59.331
Actually, from me,
of course.

07:00.833 --> 07:02.367
Helena!

07:04.170 --> 07:06.538
People never believe
what you're capable of.

07:06.605 --> 07:08.072
Do they, Helena?

07:08.140 --> 07:10.441
Well, I know
you were surprised.

07:10.509 --> 07:12.577
H.G.!

07:12.645 --> 07:14.312
Mr. Wolcott.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.148
Um, Miss Wells,

07:16.215 --> 07:17.583
Mr. Crowley,

07:17.651 --> 07:18.918
I came straight away.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.454
A curiosity has surfaced.

07:21.522 --> 07:22.522
Wait.

07:22.590 --> 07:24.057
A curiosity?

07:24.124 --> 07:25.291
A ping, darling.

07:25.359 --> 07:26.460
Oh, I like that.

07:26.527 --> 07:28.428
Continuing.

07:28.496 --> 07:30.697
It regards
the stolen artifact.

07:30.765 --> 07:32.032
Then we must go at once.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.134
Two agents have already
died on this one.

07:34.202 --> 07:36.003
I should accompany you
instead of Wolcott.

07:36.071 --> 07:37.938
I have more experience
in the field.

07:38.006 --> 07:41.408
Nonsense.
Wooly and I will be fine.

07:41.475 --> 07:43.242
Besides, if we spend too much
time together, Vincent,

07:43.310 --> 07:44.811
people will talk.

07:44.878 --> 07:47.780
I'm dreadfully sorry,
everybody,

07:47.847 --> 07:49.314
but it appears
I shall have to leave you

07:49.382 --> 07:51.950
in the hands of my
captivating co-host.

07:52.018 --> 07:53.719
Well, I shall be
more than delighted

07:53.787 --> 07:55.387
to entertain the ladies.

07:55.455 --> 07:58.991
Mr. Wells, do tell us
about your next story.

07:59.058 --> 08:01.193
Yes, Charles, do tell.

08:03.129 --> 08:05.064
Oh, well, I'm afraid
you'll just have to wait.

08:05.132 --> 08:07.166
No, really, I insist.

08:07.234 --> 08:10.970
Ladies, you must make him
tell you.

08:11.038 --> 08:12.806
They're the work
of a genius.

08:12.874 --> 08:14.175
- Yeah.
- Come, Wooly.

08:14.242 --> 08:16.277
You can fill me in
while I change.

08:16.345 --> 08:18.546
Change clothes?

08:18.614 --> 08:21.516
This way.
No dawdling.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.160
Details, please.

08:31.228 --> 08:32.628
What and when?

08:32.696 --> 08:34.530
Um, strange dust,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.532
same as we found
when the agents were murdered.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.235
Bobby discovered it
this morning.

08:39.303 --> 08:41.270
He heard the tone as well.

08:41.337 --> 08:43.105
Location?

08:43.173 --> 08:45.074
Duncan,
off Piccadilly.

08:45.142 --> 08:47.577
That's rather public.

08:47.644 --> 08:50.212
Our adversary
has become quite bold.

08:58.888 --> 09:00.055
Something wrong?

09:00.123 --> 09:02.191
No.
No matter.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.665
I asked the Bobby to, um--

09:09.733 --> 09:11.634
what's that term you use?

09:11.701 --> 09:13.068
Preserve the scene,

09:13.136 --> 09:14.803
knowing how much you like
to examine every detail.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.643
Come, Mr. Wolcott.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.545
In the words
of my good friend Mr. Doyle,

09:22.612 --> 09:24.513
the game's afoot.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.693
Thank you, constable.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.100
It's ours all right.
Have a look.

09:44.168 --> 09:47.069
I'll take your word
for it.

09:47.137 --> 09:50.706
Um, are you sure you should
be touching that?

09:50.774 --> 09:53.309
How else do you imagine
I can determine its origins?

09:53.377 --> 09:54.878
What do you make of it?

09:54.945 --> 09:56.780
A passerby saw something
he oughtn't?

09:56.847 --> 09:58.782
Or perhaps
the thief just wanted

09:58.849 --> 10:01.250
to test the power
of the horn.

10:01.318 --> 10:03.252
No.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.188
But I'm beginning to see
a modus operandi.

10:06.256 --> 10:08.857
The agents from whom
the artifact was stolen

10:08.925 --> 10:10.125
were ambushed.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.859
He knew where they'd be
and when.

10:11.927 --> 10:13.694
This attack was the same.

10:13.762 --> 10:17.331
Only this time it will
be his undoing.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.866
You speak
quite confidently.

10:18.934 --> 10:21.168
Because I am
quite confident.

10:21.235 --> 10:24.104
Before you boast that
the culprit is undone,

10:24.172 --> 10:26.606
might you have to identify
the victim first?

10:26.674 --> 10:27.974
I already have.

10:28.042 --> 10:32.412
A notebook page filled
with columns of dates and times.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.646
Schedule.

10:33.714 --> 10:34.814
This street
is a direct path

10:34.882 --> 10:36.550
from the Royal
Astronomical Society

10:36.618 --> 10:37.818
to the London Observatory.

10:37.885 --> 10:40.253
The numbers,
astronomical observations.

10:40.321 --> 10:41.955
Our victim
was an astronomer.

10:42.023 --> 10:44.557
Sir James Eddington
to be exact.

10:44.625 --> 10:47.627
He and I were engaged
in a project of sorts.

10:47.695 --> 10:50.130
Brilliant man.

10:50.197 --> 10:52.833
Sadly his wife
never appreciated him.

10:52.901 --> 10:54.568
Really, H.G.,
is there not a man in London

10:54.636 --> 10:56.737
whom you haven't charmed?

10:56.805 --> 10:58.372
Oscar Wilde.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.142
And not for
lack of trying.

11:01.209 --> 11:04.779
How can you be certain
it's Eddington?

11:04.847 --> 11:06.147
Acetone.

11:06.215 --> 11:07.783
Excessive ketones
in the blood.

11:07.850 --> 11:10.052
Sir Eddington was diabetic.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.988
We're mere hours
behind our thief, Wolcott.

11:13.056 --> 11:15.791
Eddington was on his way
to the observatory.

11:15.859 --> 11:17.926
Our man with the horn
was out to stop him.

11:25.469 --> 11:26.469
Horn.

11:26.537 --> 11:28.137
The horn, the horn.

11:28.205 --> 11:29.939
Horn.

11:30.007 --> 11:32.642
It's not--

11:32.710 --> 11:37.413
is the horn you're talking
about this, this horn?

11:37.481 --> 11:38.848
Joshua's Trumpet?

11:38.916 --> 11:41.317
As in Joshua who brought down
the walls of Jericho?

11:41.385 --> 11:44.187
An ancient ram's horn that
emits a blast of such power...

11:44.255 --> 11:45.488
The noise?

11:45.556 --> 11:48.758
That it pulverizes
anything in its path.

11:48.826 --> 11:50.059
The fall of Jericho was real.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.494
The horn inspired
the legend of how.

11:51.562 --> 11:52.495
You've seen it?

11:52.562 --> 11:54.129
Over 100 years ago, yes.

11:54.197 --> 11:56.699
Well, someone
in Pittsburgh has this now,

11:56.767 --> 11:58.468
and people are gonna
keep dying

11:58.535 --> 12:01.103
until we find it.

12:05.554 --> 12:08.055
The blast resonates
at a molecular level.

12:08.123 --> 12:11.492
How far away can this horn be
and still blast someone?

12:11.559 --> 12:13.227
Pete, H.G.'s
dealt with it before.

12:13.294 --> 12:15.328
Don't act like
she's not even here.

12:15.396 --> 12:17.296
You just told me she isn't,
which is fine by me.

12:17.364 --> 12:18.965
We don't need her.
We can find this ourselves.

12:19.032 --> 12:20.532
Artie?

12:20.600 --> 12:21.967
There's something else
that's familiar about this,

12:22.035 --> 12:23.235
and it's not
Joshua's Trumpet.

12:23.303 --> 12:24.503
It's something else.

12:24.571 --> 12:25.837
I'm sorry, I just
gotta figure out what--

12:25.905 --> 12:27.739
what it is,
and I'm not sure.

12:27.807 --> 12:29.274
Okay, all right, well,

12:29.342 --> 12:30.609
well, Pete asked
a good question.

12:30.677 --> 12:32.011
You know, if these things
aren't drive-bys,

12:32.078 --> 12:33.846
maybe the blasts are coming
from a common location.

12:33.914 --> 12:35.882
You know, hey, give me a range.
I can triangulate.

12:35.949 --> 12:37.550
15, 20 meters at most.

12:37.618 --> 12:39.352
Oh, well, hey,
then this isn't even

12:39.420 --> 12:41.121
the same artifact,
'cause no one was close

12:41.188 --> 12:42.889
to the guy
on the billboard.

12:42.957 --> 12:44.091
Well, what if
it was modified

12:44.158 --> 12:45.192
so it could work
from a longer distance?

12:45.259 --> 12:46.694
Let her help.

12:46.762 --> 12:47.962
I mean, she's the only one
of us who's seen it.

12:48.029 --> 12:49.897
Yeah, 100 years ago.

12:49.964 --> 12:51.598
And she's not one of us.

12:51.666 --> 12:53.867
Even if it is the horn,

12:53.934 --> 12:55.668
I'm afraid I might not
be able to help.

12:55.736 --> 12:57.370
Why not?
Who had it last?

12:57.437 --> 12:59.738
That's the thing,
no one did.

13:11.952 --> 13:14.086
What on earth?

13:14.154 --> 13:16.723
Not earth.
The heavens.

13:16.791 --> 13:18.859
A spacecraft
carrying men to the stars.

13:18.926 --> 13:20.327
Incredible.

13:20.395 --> 13:21.862
Who could have dreamed
of such a thing?

13:21.930 --> 13:24.198
Really, Wooly,
will you never know me?

13:28.404 --> 13:30.639
Here, Wooly, hold this.

13:30.706 --> 13:32.440
Sir Eddington and I
were in the process

13:32.508 --> 13:34.576
of finding
a power source.

13:38.481 --> 13:39.948
And it appears someone
has decided

13:40.016 --> 13:41.149
that the horn
would fit the bill.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.888
Tell me, Wooly,
do you know why

13:46.956 --> 13:48.690
a woman keeps her diary
facing down?

13:48.758 --> 13:50.459
What? Why?

13:50.527 --> 13:52.395
It discourages
prying eyes.

13:52.462 --> 13:54.030
What does your diary
have to do with anything?

13:54.097 --> 13:56.165
It's where the thief
learned about the rocket.

13:56.233 --> 13:59.102
Before he hired the two men
pointing pistols at us.

13:59.169 --> 14:00.169
Oh, hello.

14:00.237 --> 14:02.072
Hello.

14:11.349 --> 14:13.249
You're too clever
for your own good, Helena.

14:13.317 --> 14:17.921
I had hoped
that dispatching Eddington

14:17.988 --> 14:19.322
would have delayed you
long enough

14:19.390 --> 14:20.657
for me to finish.

14:20.724 --> 14:23.593
Mr. Crowley.
This is a turn.

14:23.661 --> 14:25.462
What on earth
are you doing, Vincent?

14:25.529 --> 14:27.930
You know the dangers
of misusing artifacts.

14:27.998 --> 14:29.232
Don't lecture me, Helena.

14:29.299 --> 14:31.067
I'm not your idiot brother.

14:31.135 --> 14:32.836
The Empire is on the wane.

14:32.903 --> 14:36.573
I've even heard talk of moving
the Warehouse to America.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.375
That decision is in the hands
of the Regents.

14:38.442 --> 14:39.776
It isn't something
you can stop.

14:39.844 --> 14:41.444
It's not something
I can allow.

14:41.512 --> 14:46.416
England must use the Warehouse
to her advantage.

14:46.483 --> 14:49.051
Imagine the fear that will
strike in all the world

14:49.119 --> 14:51.686
when this device
comes crashing down

14:51.754 --> 14:53.355
in front of the Reichstag.

14:53.422 --> 14:56.591
The mere demonstration
will secure British dominance

14:56.658 --> 14:59.026
for another century.

14:59.094 --> 15:00.861
I should never have allowed
that glint of madness

15:00.929 --> 15:02.263
to appeal to me.

15:02.330 --> 15:05.866
Never fails to become a lover's
least attractive trait.

15:05.934 --> 15:09.036
I have enjoyed
your companionship, Helena.

15:09.104 --> 15:12.407
My only regret
was deceiving you.

15:14.444 --> 15:16.277
Then you have
nothing to regret.

15:27.290 --> 15:28.224
You knew? When?

15:28.291 --> 15:29.825
When he killed Eddington.

15:32.829 --> 15:34.563
I knew then that the culprit
was someone close to me.

15:34.630 --> 15:35.630
You might have warned me.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.833
He obviously had
no intention of killing me,

15:38.901 --> 15:40.234
otherwise I'd
be dead already.

15:40.302 --> 15:43.971
Oh, how reassuring...
For you.

15:44.038 --> 15:45.772
You've been studying Kenpo.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.040
Yeah, well, I've seen you
use it on enough men

15:47.108 --> 15:48.208
to fear that you would use it
on me one day.

15:50.611 --> 15:52.479
No!

16:07.561 --> 16:09.429
I do hope you were
flattered by my diary.

16:09.496 --> 16:12.299
I do tend to exaggerate
a bit though.

16:23.045 --> 16:24.045
Go!

16:40.828 --> 16:42.696
Tell me, Wolcott,

16:42.764 --> 16:47.100
why do so many men prove to be
so untrustworthy?

16:47.168 --> 16:48.869
Might I suggest
that it is you

16:48.936 --> 16:50.570
who brings the devil
out in them?

16:50.638 --> 16:52.773
Bravo, Wooly.

16:52.841 --> 16:55.710
The art of deduction
at its very best.

16:55.778 --> 16:59.380
After that, it was back
to the drawing board.

17:02.052 --> 17:04.854
Oh, okay.

17:04.922 --> 17:07.357
So you built a rocket

17:07.424 --> 17:09.992
in 1893

17:10.059 --> 17:11.560
and, what,
saved the world

17:11.627 --> 17:13.828
from a century
of bad English cooking?

17:13.896 --> 17:15.463
You yourself
have used my time machine,

17:15.531 --> 17:18.299
but a tube that shoots
into the air strains credulity?

17:18.367 --> 17:19.634
Okay, so you changed
the trajectory.

17:19.701 --> 17:21.068
Where did you aim it?

17:21.136 --> 17:23.002
Straight for the stars,
I thought.

17:23.070 --> 17:24.938
I'd hoped it would be the last
the world would see of it.

17:25.006 --> 17:27.107
So if this thing in Pittsburgh
is Joshua's Trumpet,

17:27.174 --> 17:28.942
then what went up
eventually came down.

17:29.009 --> 17:32.345
Greenbury, Ohio, 1962.

17:35.483 --> 17:40.687
♪ ♪

17:40.755 --> 17:42.923
Billy, I'm not easy.

17:42.991 --> 17:46.627
Of course not, Peg.
I was just--

17:46.695 --> 17:49.463
hey, let's go see it, huh?

17:49.531 --> 17:52.599
Oh.
Wait up!

17:52.667 --> 17:54.168
Dad's gonna ground me
for sure.

17:56.004 --> 17:57.305
Bill, be careful.

17:57.372 --> 17:59.807
Whatever's back there,
it killed Doug Varley.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.343
Oh, Doug probably spotted
some prehistoric Dodo bird

18:02.411 --> 18:04.512
and followed it up
to Sandusky.

18:08.851 --> 18:10.084
Whoa, Nelly.

18:10.152 --> 18:11.786
William Peter Nelson,

18:11.854 --> 18:13.421
you take me home
right this instant.

18:13.489 --> 18:15.524
Oh, Peg,
the Coffey Brothers

18:15.591 --> 18:17.192
probably built that in
their shop for the fair and--

18:32.510 --> 18:33.610
Good, good.

18:33.678 --> 18:35.612
That gave it
a little more power.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.148
Keep trying
till I get their attention.

18:53.302 --> 18:54.669
Jack and Rebecca
saw something

18:54.737 --> 18:57.238
that looked like a crashed
rocket in 1962.

18:57.306 --> 18:58.540
And you think
it was H.G.'s?

18:58.608 --> 18:59.808
The '60s was Sputnik,

18:59.876 --> 19:01.577
it was the space race.

19:01.644 --> 19:04.479
Could have been any number
of secret launches.

19:04.547 --> 19:05.747
I never read
that Sputnik 7

19:05.815 --> 19:06.882
was equipped
with a cow cooker.

19:06.950 --> 19:08.717
That sounds like mine.

19:08.785 --> 19:10.886
It probably is,
except whatever this thing was

19:10.954 --> 19:13.255
Jack and Rebecca--
they say it was destroyed.

19:13.323 --> 19:15.659
Ah, so inconclusive.

19:15.726 --> 19:17.227
All right,
you get to Ohio

19:17.295 --> 19:18.695
and see if there's any
physical evidence left

19:18.762 --> 19:20.329
after all these years.

19:20.397 --> 19:21.665
We've gotta figure out where
this thing is shooting from.

19:21.733 --> 19:22.866
I'll search
for living witnesses.

19:22.934 --> 19:23.867
Yeah, and see if
anybody from Greenbury

19:23.935 --> 19:25.135
now lives in Pittsburgh.

19:25.203 --> 19:26.804
Is H.G. coming with us?

19:26.872 --> 19:28.139
Wait, wait, what?
So you trust her now?

19:28.207 --> 19:29.207
Well, she has nothing
to gain anymore.

19:29.275 --> 19:30.975
Nothing to gain?

19:31.043 --> 19:33.478
She's in some
woo-woo prison someplace.

19:33.546 --> 19:35.546
"Quid pro quo, Clarice."

19:35.614 --> 19:36.947
First she wants
a room with a view,

19:37.015 --> 19:39.183
next thing she's eating
a guard's face.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.718
- You do know I can hear you.
- Okay, stop!

19:41.786 --> 19:43.186
She goes.
She has intel.

19:50.428 --> 19:51.995
Never been to Ohio.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.000
And that's how
you turn her off.

19:57.068 --> 19:59.303
All right, you--uh-uh.
You take this.

19:59.371 --> 20:01.372
And keep going through
Jack and Rebecca's file.

20:01.439 --> 20:03.340
If we cannot crack
this case in the present,

20:03.408 --> 20:06.244
we need all the help
we can get from the past.

20:08.514 --> 20:11.984
And then the cow
was just gone.

20:12.052 --> 20:13.885
All right,
you drink this down now.

20:16.522 --> 20:20.091
Excuse me,
is this the Meyer house?

20:20.159 --> 20:22.126
Agents Secord and Saint Clair,
Secret Service.

20:22.194 --> 20:24.561
We retrieve dangerous objects.

20:24.629 --> 20:27.631
We heard you kids
saw something?

20:27.698 --> 20:30.633
I don't know
what else to say.

20:30.701 --> 20:33.536
It looked like a spaceship,
and it ray-gunned a cow.

20:36.908 --> 20:39.543
Rose, Peggy, is it true?
Did you see it?

20:39.611 --> 20:41.745
Come on in please, Nora.

20:41.813 --> 20:43.748
This is Doug Varley's wife,

20:43.816 --> 20:45.283
and that's
his little boy.

20:45.351 --> 20:46.718
You're from
the government, right?

20:46.786 --> 20:48.019
Can you find my Doug?

20:48.087 --> 20:49.454
I'm sorry, Mrs. Varley,

20:49.522 --> 20:50.789
we just don't know
anything yet.

20:50.857 --> 20:51.991
I'm sorry to barge in,

20:52.058 --> 20:53.192
but I'm so worried
about Doug.

20:53.260 --> 20:55.360
Hey, kiddo.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.995
I'm Rebecca.

20:57.063 --> 20:59.564
You got a name?
Daniel.

20:59.632 --> 21:01.900
Are you one
of the Mercury Seven?

21:01.967 --> 21:03.034
You got a favorite?

21:03.102 --> 21:04.602
John Glenn's from Ohio.

21:04.669 --> 21:05.903
He orbited the earth.

21:05.970 --> 21:08.205
Is that what
you wanna do someday?

21:08.272 --> 21:11.941
Are you gonna fight the
spacemen and get my dad back?

21:12.009 --> 21:13.143
Can I help?

21:15.646 --> 21:17.080
Daniel,
go outside and wait.

21:24.521 --> 21:26.022
Mrs. Varley,
Rebecca and I

21:26.090 --> 21:28.024
have seen a lot
of strange things.

21:28.092 --> 21:30.326
But I'm pretty sure
there are no little green men

21:30.393 --> 21:31.594
with ray guns.

21:31.661 --> 21:33.362
Tell that to the cow.

21:50.950 --> 21:52.250
What?

21:52.318 --> 21:54.485
Reenacting what those kids
were doing out here

21:54.553 --> 21:56.621
might give us some insight
into what they saw.

21:56.688 --> 21:59.023
What a line.

22:03.261 --> 22:05.329
Jack, I do love you,

22:05.396 --> 22:07.597
but...

22:07.665 --> 22:09.099
Given the way
things turn out

22:09.166 --> 22:12.268
for most warehouse agents,

22:12.336 --> 22:13.503
are we sure?

22:13.570 --> 22:15.571
Hell, I'm sure.

22:15.639 --> 22:18.208
Okay, okay.
Down, boy, heel.

22:18.275 --> 22:20.010
We'll talk later,

22:20.078 --> 22:23.314
if the Martians don't take us
away in their flying saucer.

22:30.956 --> 22:33.391
Well, I don't see
any Martians, do you?

22:33.459 --> 22:36.894
No, but I'll bet
I see our artifact.

22:45.703 --> 22:50.240
Out there is one seriously
lopsided goat.

22:53.844 --> 22:55.645
Okay.
It's unstable.

22:55.712 --> 22:57.413
How do we bag it without
ending up like the cow?

23:00.650 --> 23:03.252
Okay, here's how
it's gonna go.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.921
I'm gonna disconnect
the horn.

23:04.988 --> 23:05.922
And me?

23:05.989 --> 23:07.724
You gaze at me lovingly.

23:07.791 --> 23:09.459
Brilliant.

23:11.495 --> 23:14.197
Looks like it's sealed
with wax.

23:15.399 --> 23:16.699
Shall we entertain
a plan "B"?

23:19.402 --> 23:20.902
Yeah, run!

23:49.637 --> 23:51.071
Well, something
took a big bite

23:51.138 --> 23:53.640
out of Jack
and Rebecca's car in 1962.

23:55.710 --> 23:58.078
Hey, Myks, Jack's hat.

24:01.516 --> 24:03.984
This edge, it has the same
markings as the billboard.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.452
Which means that
whatever did this

24:05.520 --> 24:07.854
is also responsible
for the deaths in Pittsburgh.

24:07.922 --> 24:09.757
Well, Jack and Rebecca
said whatever it was

24:09.824 --> 24:11.825
it vaporized itself.

24:11.893 --> 24:14.161
They brought
a whole team out here,

24:14.228 --> 24:17.197
searched the farm
from top to bottom.

24:17.265 --> 24:19.967
Still, they could
have been mistaken.

24:20.035 --> 24:22.002
Whoa!

24:22.070 --> 24:24.005
Oh, awesome.

24:24.072 --> 24:26.908
Check it out,
<i>Astounding Tales.</i>

24:26.976 --> 24:31.146
Ah, didn't take Jack as
an <i>Astounding Tales</i> kinda guy.

24:31.214 --> 24:32.348
<i>Playboy,</i> maybe.

24:32.415 --> 24:34.984
Now those are some
astounding tales.

24:35.052 --> 24:36.319
One of my short stories
is in there.

24:36.386 --> 24:37.720
Imagine the royalties.

24:37.788 --> 24:39.522
Yes, just what
the world needs,

24:39.590 --> 24:41.223
a rich homicidal maniac.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.758
You could buy yourself
a secret island lair

24:43.826 --> 24:46.728
and hire someone
to twirl your moustache.

25:02.145 --> 25:04.179
Now how are we supposed
to stop that thing?

25:04.247 --> 25:06.882
Won't know without
a closer look.

25:06.949 --> 25:08.717
You ready?
Yeah.

25:18.996 --> 25:21.430
All right, I think I can
hit it with the Tesla.

25:21.498 --> 25:22.865
It might melt the wax.

25:22.933 --> 25:23.999
I'm a better shot
than you.

25:24.067 --> 25:26.803
Hockey pucks.
Kiss for good luck?

25:34.312 --> 25:36.247
All right, well,
that was plan "Z".

25:36.315 --> 25:37.748
You?

25:37.816 --> 25:40.718
Sometimes a bullet
is your best friend.

25:40.786 --> 25:42.453
It could destroy
the artifact.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.588
And live to bag others?
Sounds like a fair swap.

26:05.843 --> 26:08.045
Where's the horn?

26:31.302 --> 26:32.602
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

26:32.670 --> 26:33.970
Hey, Myks.

26:34.038 --> 26:36.272
This trench, this could be
a crash site, right?

26:36.340 --> 26:38.842
Sure.

26:43.381 --> 26:44.548
Bingo.

26:47.419 --> 26:49.687
Brass.

26:49.755 --> 26:51.789
Looks 1890s-ish, doesn't it?

26:54.127 --> 26:55.961
Ooh, that's right,
you can't catch

26:56.029 --> 26:59.898
because you're in scary
Regent Prison where you belong.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.633
Oh, that joke simply
never gets old.

27:01.701 --> 27:03.234
This is from my rocket.

27:03.302 --> 27:06.338
I'm certain.

27:08.007 --> 27:10.308
Hey, Claude,
okay, listen to me.

27:10.376 --> 27:13.878
Joshua's Trumpet was here
in 1962.

27:13.946 --> 27:15.679
And it's the same artifact
that we're looking for now.

27:15.747 --> 27:18.115
Awesome, except it's not
quite the same.

27:18.183 --> 27:20.183
You were right about
someone in Pittsburgh

27:20.251 --> 27:22.186
changing the artifact
to make it stronger.

27:22.253 --> 27:23.721
They just zapped
a helicopter out of the sky

27:23.788 --> 27:25.089
from a mile up.

27:25.156 --> 27:27.024
A mile?

27:27.091 --> 27:28.625
Myks, this guy
could be anywhere.

27:28.693 --> 27:30.027
Are you sure
that it's the same horn?

27:30.094 --> 27:32.229
Pilots radioed
they heard a strange sound

27:32.297 --> 27:33.631
just before
they lost control.

27:33.698 --> 27:34.965
And then
they were both killed.

27:43.676 --> 27:45.678
You know what, lady?

27:45.746 --> 27:47.847
You are bad news.

27:47.915 --> 27:50.083
Whenever you show up,
people die,

27:50.151 --> 27:51.585
people disappear.

27:51.653 --> 27:54.622
One way or another,
everything turns to crap.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.658
You can't seriously be
blaming me for these deaths.

27:56.726 --> 27:58.260
I'm in prison.

27:58.328 --> 27:59.594
Surprise, surprise.

27:59.662 --> 28:01.396
You're responsible.

28:01.463 --> 28:04.699
Pete, you're being
completely unreasonable.

28:04.766 --> 28:08.769
Ooh, one of my short stories
was in there.

28:08.837 --> 28:11.038
The woman ruins everything!

28:11.106 --> 28:12.473
Pete, I'm back.

28:12.541 --> 28:13.774
Look, Myka--

28:13.842 --> 28:15.409
No, I came back.

28:15.477 --> 28:18.579
It still doesn't
change the fact that--

28:23.884 --> 28:25.485
Okay, I'm sorry.

28:25.553 --> 28:27.454
Me too.

28:30.658 --> 28:33.960
Okay, okay,
so how did this horn

28:34.027 --> 28:37.196
get from this farm in Ohio
in 1962

28:37.264 --> 28:38.531
to Pittsburgh today?

28:38.599 --> 28:40.166
Somebody must
have been out here

28:40.234 --> 28:41.534
that Jack and Rebecca
didn't know about.

28:41.602 --> 28:43.136
No, Claudia checked though.

28:43.204 --> 28:45.339
Nobody moved from
Greenbury to Pittsburgh.

28:45.407 --> 28:46.574
So how do we find them?

28:53.917 --> 28:55.017
Myka, look at this.

28:55.085 --> 28:57.053
That's a kid's handwriting.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.554
Maybe this book
isn't Jack's.

28:58.622 --> 29:00.756
Jack and Rebecca's file.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.758
Remember, there was that
little boy who lost his father

29:02.826 --> 29:04.627
and he was
an astronaut buff.

29:04.694 --> 29:06.128
Right, so maybe
this is his.

29:06.196 --> 29:08.097
He thought they took
his dad to outer space.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.532
He wanted to come back here
to the farm

29:10.600 --> 29:11.699
with Jack and Rebecca, right?

29:11.767 --> 29:13.468
So he--he hid in the trunk?

29:15.571 --> 29:17.471
He must have
picked up the horn,

29:17.539 --> 29:19.340
and that's how it got
to Pittsburgh.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.411
Hey, Claude,
see what you can pull up

29:23.478 --> 29:25.513
on Daniel Varley.
Varley.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.447
More power.

29:30.184 --> 29:33.453
It needs more power.

29:42.997 --> 29:46.066
Gliese 581.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.938
Gliese 581.

30:09.458 --> 30:12.393
This time they're
gonna hear me.

30:24.377 --> 30:26.012
I love Pittsburgh.

30:26.079 --> 30:28.448
They put fries
on nachos here.

30:28.516 --> 30:30.050
So why didn't Daniel Varley

30:30.117 --> 30:31.919
show up in any
of your searches?

30:31.986 --> 30:33.620
As of four months ago,
Daniel Varley doesn't show up

30:33.688 --> 30:35.056
in anyone's searches.

30:35.123 --> 30:36.591
Dude has just completely
fallen through the cracks.

30:36.658 --> 30:37.925
I mean, it's kinda hard
to find someone

30:37.993 --> 30:39.961
who lives in Pittsburgh
if they're homeless.

30:40.028 --> 30:41.395
Academically
beyond brilliant

30:41.463 --> 30:44.332
but socially and
psychologically not so much.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.567
In and out of psych hospitals
his whole life.

30:46.635 --> 30:48.402
I'm surprised
we never met.

30:48.470 --> 30:50.504
Yeah, now,
when he was functioning,

30:50.572 --> 30:52.706
Varley taught astronomy.

30:52.774 --> 30:54.674
He volunteered for SETI.

30:54.742 --> 30:57.510
SETI, yeah,
that's where those guys

30:57.578 --> 31:01.414
scan the skies
looking for intelligent life.

31:01.481 --> 31:03.083
What?
I saw <i>Contact.</i>

31:03.150 --> 31:06.587
So he's still obsessed
with outer space?

31:06.655 --> 31:07.755
Oh!

31:07.823 --> 31:09.089
Oh.

31:09.157 --> 31:11.258
Sorry, guys.
Mmm, oh.

31:11.326 --> 31:14.396
Oh, my God, sorry.

31:14.463 --> 31:15.564
Ugh!

31:15.631 --> 31:16.965
Oh, nobody wants
to see that.

31:17.033 --> 31:18.166
Sorry.

31:18.234 --> 31:19.301
You know what,
I'm just gonna pretend

31:19.369 --> 31:20.402
that we own a big dog.

31:20.470 --> 31:22.404
Well, we kinda do.

31:22.472 --> 31:24.006
Pete.

31:24.074 --> 31:25.708
What?
I didn't want to waste any.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.543
Mmm.

31:29.079 --> 31:32.148
So--so how do we find
Daniel Varley?

31:32.215 --> 31:34.684
All right, now,
his last job

31:34.751 --> 31:39.056
before he fell off
the grid...

31:39.123 --> 31:41.625
Yeah, he was a teacher
at West PA Tech.

31:41.693 --> 31:44.061
Look for Professor Wilmore.

31:44.129 --> 31:45.096
Find him.

31:50.703 --> 31:52.771
This was Daniel's office.

31:52.839 --> 31:56.209
No one's had time
to clean it up.

31:56.277 --> 31:57.744
Ooh.

31:57.812 --> 32:01.014
Looks like somebody won first
prize ten years in a row.

32:02.883 --> 32:05.184
Dan was always troubled.

32:05.251 --> 32:07.453
Didn't like people near him.

32:07.520 --> 32:10.422
Then this personal project
eclipsed everything.

32:11.857 --> 32:14.325
Myka, these are sky maps,
star charts.

32:14.393 --> 32:17.561
My dad and I used
to do this stuff.

32:17.629 --> 32:19.596
These are all about
the same star.

32:19.664 --> 32:22.366
What's so important
about GL-581?

32:22.434 --> 32:24.068
Gliese 581.

32:24.136 --> 32:27.038
It's pretty close to us,
around 20 light years.

32:27.106 --> 32:28.874
It's getting
a lot of attention

32:28.941 --> 32:30.075
because we think
it might have planets

32:30.143 --> 32:31.576
in the Goldilocks Zone.

32:31.644 --> 32:34.013
Goldilocks.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.015
Not too hot and not too cold.

32:36.082 --> 32:37.716
Just right to support life.

32:37.784 --> 32:39.151
The Internet went crazy

32:39.219 --> 32:40.853
over the discovery
late last year.

32:40.921 --> 32:43.522
That's right when Daniel
was getting worse.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.825
Daniel thought his dad
was abducted by aliens,

32:45.892 --> 32:47.393
and now he thinks
he's found them.

32:47.461 --> 32:48.794
So he's gonna shoot
the horn at the star?

32:48.862 --> 32:50.396
I mean, what would
that accomplish?

32:50.464 --> 32:51.765
Who knows?

32:51.832 --> 32:53.500
If he is,
the locations make sense.

32:53.567 --> 32:54.600
- Why?
- Check this out.

32:54.668 --> 32:55.702
Okay, I took
all three spots.

32:55.769 --> 32:56.936
The bridge,
the utility pole,

32:57.004 --> 32:58.037
and the helicopter.
Yeah.

32:58.105 --> 32:59.539
And I drew lines
to where GL-581

32:59.607 --> 33:00.974
was in the sky each time.
Oh.

33:01.041 --> 33:02.875
All three lines originate
from the same spot.

33:02.943 --> 33:05.011
The SETI facility where
Daniel Varley used to work.

33:05.079 --> 33:07.247
- What's there now?
- Nothing.

33:07.315 --> 33:08.883
It was shut down
due to cutbacks.

33:10.185 --> 33:11.918
Oh, my.

33:11.986 --> 33:13.887
That sounds bad.

33:13.955 --> 33:17.058
If this guy shoots at that
star again tonight,

33:17.125 --> 33:19.360
it'll cut right through
Allegheny Field.

33:19.428 --> 33:20.628
In the middle
of a ball game.

33:39.347 --> 33:41.348
- Stay back.
- I'm gonna take the shot.

33:43.952 --> 33:47.154
I warned you.
Wait, you're with the agents.

33:47.222 --> 33:49.657
Jack and Rebecca.

33:49.724 --> 33:50.925
Yeah.

33:50.992 --> 33:54.762
Yeah, yeah, Daniel.
That's right.

33:54.830 --> 33:57.565
Jack and Rebecca.

33:57.633 --> 33:58.666
They were your friends, right?

33:58.734 --> 34:01.002
This won't work, Daniel.

34:01.070 --> 34:03.572
GL-581 is 20 light years away.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.774
They've been here.
They can see us.

34:05.842 --> 34:07.709
I just want them to know
I have their device.

34:07.777 --> 34:09.077
No, no, Daniel,

34:09.145 --> 34:10.646
you've already killed
four people.

34:10.713 --> 34:12.114
What?

34:12.181 --> 34:13.715
No, no.
No, I haven't.

34:13.783 --> 34:15.516
Daniel,
you're a smart guy.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.219
You've already seen
what the horn can do.

34:17.286 --> 34:18.620
If you do this,

34:18.688 --> 34:20.455
it's gonna rip right through
Allegheny Field.

34:20.523 --> 34:21.889
I don't believe you.

34:21.958 --> 34:23.759
And I don't care.

34:23.826 --> 34:25.927
They need to know
that I'm here,

34:25.995 --> 34:27.395
to see me.

34:27.463 --> 34:28.830
And now they will.

34:28.898 --> 34:30.697
No! No!

34:34.335 --> 34:36.737
I hacked into
the stadium box office.

34:36.804 --> 34:38.572
There's, like, 40,000 fans
there tonight, Artie.

34:38.639 --> 34:40.541
No, I got it, I got it.

34:40.609 --> 34:42.911
Yeah, my contact, he can
call for an evacuation,

34:42.978 --> 34:44.646
but there's no way in hell
he can clear that many people

34:44.714 --> 34:46.815
out of there
in that short of time.

34:46.882 --> 34:49.118
Come on, guys.

34:55.359 --> 34:57.361
Daniel, a lot of innocent
people are gonna die

34:57.429 --> 34:59.897
at Allegheny Field tonight.

34:59.965 --> 35:01.432
Why would you want that?

35:01.500 --> 35:03.400
I've waited all my life.

35:03.468 --> 35:06.404
These aliens, they took
my father from me.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.306
Aliens.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.808
Myka, do you
still have the sphere?

35:09.875 --> 35:11.476
What?

35:11.544 --> 35:12.710
- Turn it on.
- What?

35:12.778 --> 35:15.814
Trust me.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.261
Oh, is it time
to berate me more?

35:31.329 --> 35:34.898
This is Doug Varley's
son Daniel.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.133
He wants to know what happened
to his father.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.534
Helena built the rocket.

35:38.602 --> 35:40.436
You're the alien?

35:40.504 --> 35:42.338
The device is yours?

35:42.406 --> 35:46.275
I built the rocket
that carried it here, yes.

35:48.879 --> 35:51.247
I'm sorry about
your father, Daniel.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.615
He's gone.

35:52.683 --> 35:54.116
I know.

35:56.219 --> 35:57.486
And now it's your turn.

35:57.554 --> 35:59.655
Daniel, put the gun down.

35:59.723 --> 36:01.824
It worked.
I got you to come here.

36:01.892 --> 36:03.059
You killed my father,

36:03.126 --> 36:04.160
and now I'm gonna
kill you.

36:04.228 --> 36:05.628
You want revenge.

36:05.696 --> 36:07.130
Daniel, wait,

36:07.198 --> 36:09.266
she didn't kill
your father.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.001
No, she did.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.171
Myka, Pete's right.

36:13.238 --> 36:15.206
His father's death
is my fault.

36:16.709 --> 36:21.545
Daniel,
I am responsible.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.715
But please, you have
to listen to me.

36:32.056 --> 36:36.125

loved ones unfairly.

36:36.193 --> 36:38.327

I loved too.

36:38.395 --> 36:40.396
For me,
it was my daughter.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.532
I was so angry,

36:42.599 --> 36:44.400
in such pain.

36:44.468 --> 36:46.268
I almost hurt
a great many people.

36:46.336 --> 36:48.604
I didn't care.

36:48.672 --> 36:51.107
Just like you.

36:51.174 --> 36:53.609
But it won't make you
feel any better.

36:53.677 --> 36:56.912
And it doesn't bring
our loved ones back.

36:56.980 --> 37:00.650
But please, you have
to help me now.

37:00.717 --> 37:02.685
This isn't the answer.

37:02.752 --> 37:05.287
Why did you send it?

37:05.355 --> 37:07.789
Why did he have to die?

37:07.856 --> 37:09.690
Oh, Daniel,
it was an accident.

37:09.758 --> 37:12.960
A terrible accident.

37:13.028 --> 37:15.329
It was my job to keep
the horn from hurting anyone,

37:15.396 --> 37:18.265
and I failed.

37:18.332 --> 37:20.133
And your father

37:20.201 --> 37:21.402
and you,

37:21.469 --> 37:24.505
you paid for my failure.

37:24.573 --> 37:29.044
And for that,
I'm so dreadfully sorry.

37:29.112 --> 37:32.882
But no one else
needs to die now, do they?

38:05.401 --> 38:06.768
Great.

38:06.836 --> 38:08.303

38:13.256 --> 38:14.522
to the specifications
of my body type.

38:14.590 --> 38:16.424
I have a slight scoliosis
at the lower part

38:16.492 --> 38:17.659
of my spine,
and it travels down--

38:17.727 --> 38:18.793

having H.G. back?

38:39.682 --> 38:43.118

inside that craft

38:52.827 --> 38:54.327
