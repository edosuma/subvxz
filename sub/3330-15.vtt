00:04.704 --> 00:06.672
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.674 --> 00:10.709
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.711 --> 00:12.745
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.747 --> 00:15.347
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.783
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:20.185
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:21.653
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.655 --> 00:23.088
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:25.024
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.026 --> 00:26.658
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.028
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.363
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.532
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:36.068
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:36.070 --> 00:38.570
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.572 --> 00:40.539
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:44.077 --> 00:46.745
I'm just saying,
I don't think it's cheating.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.447
Reverse it. Put her
in the same situation.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.515
Is it cheating now?

00:51.084 --> 00:52.284
Damn.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.285
It is cheating.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.620
That's what I'm saying.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.822
(alarms whooping)

00:56.824 --> 00:59.124
Bluehawk's a go!
Code confirmed.

00:59.126 --> 00:59.825
Target...

00:59.827 --> 01:01.527
Target sequence
confirmed!

01:01.529 --> 01:02.528
What the hell, man?

01:02.530 --> 01:03.595
We never even got
a message order!

01:03.597 --> 01:05.798
We got birds ready
to leave the nest.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.799
Is this coming from you?

01:06.801 --> 01:08.801
Time sequence complete.

01:08.803 --> 01:11.303
Missiles one through five
enabling sequence commenced!

01:11.305 --> 01:12.538
I don't care
if wasn't unauthorized!

01:12.540 --> 01:13.739
The damn system here
thinks it is.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.507
Six through ten
commenced!

01:15.509 --> 01:16.775
I can't override!

01:16.777 --> 01:18.243
Sac, we need a solution now.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.612
Someone's about to prep
our missiles for launch.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.681
â™ª

01:27.353 --> 01:29.388
If he gets this strike,

01:29.390 --> 01:32.157
Tobias curtis,
the kid from coney island,

01:32.159 --> 01:33.692
Will win the pba championship

01:33.694 --> 01:36.562
With a stunning perfect game.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.796
Today, earl anthony.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.431
How the hell do you know
who earl anthony is?

01:39.433 --> 01:40.432
You're, like, 20.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.134
22. Now go.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.107
40 feet from glory.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.875
Ah, ah, ah...!

01:52.178 --> 01:53.579
Ah...!

01:53.581 --> 01:54.646
Aah!

01:56.549 --> 01:59.251
Oh, my appendix.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.619
You impressed?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.821
Uh, doc?
Glory denied.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.590
No. No, no, no.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.191
That box

02:06.193 --> 02:07.359
Is holding it up.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.161
All pins must fall.
Dem's da rules.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.829
I call shenanigans
and tomfoolery.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.431
What is that?

02:14.234 --> 02:17.236
Just something
I've been working on.

02:18.204 --> 02:19.805
It's cold, hard metal,
but it's somehow

02:19.807 --> 02:22.841
So delicate and...
So beautiful.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.310
Show is over.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.414
Andrew.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.682
It's drew, actually.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.683
Right.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.218
Drew's short for what?
Michael?

02:34.387 --> 02:35.854
Hey.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.189
Ralph's in the back.
Before we get him,

02:37.191 --> 02:39.324
I, um, I want to
show you something.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.326
What's up?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.228
I picked this
up when I was

02:43.230 --> 02:44.563
Trying out for the
portland sea dogs.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.466
It's a school
for gifted children.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.834
Uh, why are you
showing this to me?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.202
I never said
I was moving to portland.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.904
I know. Of course.

02:51.906 --> 02:54.239
I just...
I meant it when I said

02:54.241 --> 02:57.876
Toby:
I want you to push me down
the ramp this time, sylvester!

02:57.878 --> 03:00.212
More normal options.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.914
I-I'm not trying
to push you.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.248
I just wanted
you to have

03:03.250 --> 03:07.219
So that you can make
an informed decision...

03:07.221 --> 03:08.820
If and when
I get the call to pitch.
Okay.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.923
I'll take a look at it.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.591
(explosion)

03:16.896 --> 03:18.330
If that wasn't
clamped down,

03:18.332 --> 03:19.665
It would've gone right
through that wall.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.666
Cool!

03:20.668 --> 03:21.967
School time, pal.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.771
Okay.
Enjoy the science fair, buddy.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.673
Is there some rule against
baking soda volcanoes?

03:27.675 --> 03:28.907
No, it's the go-to

03:28.909 --> 03:30.342
For parents that can't think of

03:30.344 --> 03:31.877
Anything more stimulating.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.946
O... Kay!

03:33.948 --> 03:35.280
Drew, he can't be late.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.216
And you, good luck.
(kisses)

03:37.951 --> 03:40.485
There's, uh,
no such thing as luck,

03:40.487 --> 03:42.788
Only good science and math.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.926
You could be nicer.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.294
(laughs)

03:49.296 --> 03:50.963
He wants ralph to enter

03:50.965 --> 03:53.265
A project made of...
(chuckles)

03:53.267 --> 03:54.700
...Papier-mÃ¢chÃ©
and baking ingredients.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.235
What is that?

03:56.237 --> 03:58.537
"the andersen p. Wollock
school for gifted children.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.938
Portland, maine."

03:59.940 --> 04:02.241
It's just...
Drew thought, for ralph...

04:02.243 --> 04:03.408
It's super preliminary,
I'm just...

04:03.410 --> 04:04.843
I'm just doing my research.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.645
Right.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.647
(laughs) I mean, the odds of
us ever moving...

04:08.649 --> 04:09.948
This is where our life is.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.022
But a special school...
Could be good for ralph.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.290
What do you think?

04:19.025 --> 04:20.325
Portland is cold.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.961
That's it?
And wet.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.264
There's a slight chance
we might be moving there,

04:25.266 --> 04:27.332
And that's all you have
to say on the matter?

04:27.334 --> 04:29.434
You don't want to hear
my thoughts on the matter.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.435
Really?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.337
No, I... I think I do.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.739
I think there's
no logical reason

04:33.741 --> 04:34.973
Why you should be
taking that boy

04:34.975 --> 04:36.608
3,000 miles away from his home.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.876
No logical reason?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.745
What about the fact
his dad might move there

04:39.747 --> 04:42.414
And I think two parents
might benefit ralph?

04:42.416 --> 04:44.883
Well, what daytime talk show
did you hear that on?

04:44.885 --> 04:47.319
Most people would take that
as an insult, walter,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.454
But I know you don't communicate
like normal people,

04:49.456 --> 04:51.356
So I'm going
to give you a pass.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.958
But I also know
that you didn't have

04:52.960 --> 04:54.693
An ideal relationship
with your father,

04:54.695 --> 04:55.994
But that doesn't mean

04:55.996 --> 04:57.462
Ralph shouldn't have a chance.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.997
Drew is an adolescent.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.432
He plays a game for a living.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.500
He's ralph's dad!

05:01.502 --> 05:02.701
That is mere biology.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.736
It takes more than fathering
to be a father.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.038
By the time ralph is 18,

05:06.040 --> 05:07.739
He'll probably have
to take care of drew.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.415
You asked me for my thoughts
on the matter.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.549
I gave them to you.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.618
Fine.

05:23.857 --> 05:27.959
How come a bunch of geniuses
can't answer the phone?

05:27.961 --> 05:29.094
I don't carry
my phone on me.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.629
You know... Radiation.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.464
I was welding.
Mine's in my bag.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.632
Couldn't hear it
over the rocket.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.633
Cabe:
Of course.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.101
What about you, doc?

05:36.103 --> 05:37.936
I keep mine off.
I owe a bookie.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.004
Turn it on.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.107
Director merrick wants us
at homeland, stat.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.608
Let's roll.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.680
Merrick:
There was an attempted hack

05:48.682 --> 05:50.382
Of a vital federal institution
yesterday morning.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.551
Unsuccessful but barely.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.419
Our techs have been trying
to find the perpetrators,

05:54.421 --> 05:56.388
Along with cia and fbi,

05:56.390 --> 05:57.756
But we want your expertise.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.125
What federal institution?
That's need-to-know.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.727
Was it one facility
or multiple targets?

06:01.729 --> 06:03.428
<i>That's</i> need-to-know.
I need to know

06:03.430 --> 06:04.629
Why you're being so jerky.

06:04.631 --> 06:05.397
Zip it.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.467
Walter:
We have half a hack here.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.569
The redactions
on this screen-shot

06:10.571 --> 06:12.571
Cut off data that would

06:12.573 --> 06:14.806
Let us know what the culprit
was going after.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.041
Not your concern.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.409
I just need you
to backtrack

06:17.411 --> 06:18.844
And find out
who's responsible.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.112
Rest is classified.

06:20.114 --> 06:21.580
Cabe, do you know
what's going on?

06:21.582 --> 06:24.816
I do, but I'm not
at liberty to divulge.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.486
Just start hitting the keys
and see what you find out.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.421
Sure thing.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.923
There.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.426
That's better.
Merrick:
Hey!

06:34.428 --> 06:38.397
Someone was trying
to hack a nuclear silo.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.166
That's enough.
Horse is already
out of the barn, sir.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.702
Okay. Fine. Now you know.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.137
Hey, you spoke
before exhaling.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.872
That's called subliminal
carson-proxy.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.173
You withhold breath,
you withhold information.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.841
What else are you
keeping from us?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.177
Missile locations
are coded one through 50

06:52.179 --> 06:53.779
To signify what
state it's in.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.080
However, the un-redacted

06:55.082 --> 06:57.149
Cipertext notes 61.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.151
There's not 61 states,
which means that...

06:59.153 --> 07:02.120
We keep secret nukes
on foreign land.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.955
Walter:
It's logical.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.056
Our allies want protection,

07:05.058 --> 07:06.491
We want weaponry
close to our enemies.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.427
Oh, let me guess:
Uh, philippines...

07:08.429 --> 07:10.695
Finland... Iceland...

07:10.697 --> 07:12.164
He blinked at iceland.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.499
Iceland.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.502
Walter:
So...

07:17.504 --> 07:19.638
How much time
do we want to waste

07:19.640 --> 07:22.007
Before you tell us what
we'll just figure out?

07:25.678 --> 07:28.146
16 years ago, milosevic
had his sights on kosovo.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.183
The u.S. Had to step in
to prevent a slaughter.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.518
But because of political
reasons, we knew we had to do

07:33.520 --> 07:35.153
This one otr.
On the real?

07:35.155 --> 07:36.188
Cabe:
Off the record.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.456
Clinton met with

07:37.458 --> 07:39.458
The kosovan
president secretly

07:39.460 --> 07:41.159
To set up plans for military aid
far beyond what went public.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.629
This is
a clandestine sit-down

07:44.631 --> 07:47.699
This is confiscated
security footage from that day.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.802
The shooter tried
to take out both leaders.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.537
The hit was presumably
by milosevic loyalists

07:52.539 --> 07:55.807
Who spilled the beans
about the otr.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.142
Hold on.
There was an attempt

07:57.144 --> 07:58.677
On clinton
no one knows about?

07:58.679 --> 08:00.545
Actually, 28 people know.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.881
Cabe: During the melee,
clinton was whisked off,

08:02.883 --> 08:04.983
A kosovan guard was killed

08:04.985 --> 08:06.718
And a secret service agent,
bruce jones,

08:06.720 --> 08:08.053
Who was carrying the football,

08:08.055 --> 08:09.888
Was shot in the chest.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.523
And then it went missing?

08:11.525 --> 08:13.625
Not good.
What's "the football"?

08:13.627 --> 08:16.595
It's a briefcase that
follows potus everywhere.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.063
It's cuffed to
the secret service.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.598
It has the
locations of our

08:19.600 --> 08:21.166
Hidden silos
around the world

08:21.168 --> 08:23.235
And a detonator
the president can use

08:23.237 --> 08:24.769
To activate a remote launch.

08:24.771 --> 08:25.971
Toby:
Doctors had to remove

08:25.973 --> 08:27.772
The case from bruce's
wrist to operate.

08:27.774 --> 08:31.510
Deposed medical staff said
they put it on the ground

08:31.512 --> 08:33.979
Next to the gurney while they
were triaging the patient.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.581
They would have the detonator
and launch codes.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.250
Cabe:
Codes were changed
immediately,

08:38.252 --> 08:40.151
But the location
of our hidden arsenal

08:40.153 --> 08:42.654
Of whoever had possession
of the football.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.089
Merrick:
Our theory was that

08:44.091 --> 08:45.557
The shooting
served as a subterfuge

08:45.559 --> 08:46.691
To get to the football.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.660
But years passed
without incident.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.663
Tossed away accidentally
in all the disorder.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.831
Until this hack attempt.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.599
Cabe:
Whoever has it...

08:54.601 --> 08:56.668
<i>Has waited 16 years</i>
<i>for their capabilities</i>

08:56.670 --> 08:59.004
<i>To advance to where</i>
<i>they could hack into the system</i>

08:59.006 --> 09:00.639
<i>And dupe it into believing</i>

09:00.641 --> 09:02.173
<i>Accurate launch codes</i>
<i>had been entered.</i>

09:02.175 --> 09:03.675
<i>They came so close today.</i>

09:03.677 --> 09:05.710
<i>They won't be denied,</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:07.846
<i>Because they know</i>
<i>the devastation they can cause.</i>

09:07.848 --> 09:10.615
Merrick: <i>Once a missile's</i>
<i>prepped for launch,</i>

09:10.617 --> 09:13.084
All that's left is to press
the football's remote button.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.186
No one can track this
back to the terrorists in time.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.923
So the only shot
is to find the football,

09:17.925 --> 09:19.758
So even if they do hack

09:19.760 --> 09:21.993
A missile silo, they won't have
access to the launch button.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.298
What makes you think that
we can find the football now?

09:26.300 --> 09:27.732
Well, mr. Negative... For
starters, you have a witness.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.200
That agent who caught a bullet.

09:29.202 --> 09:33.171
It says he saw "shapes of people
running around the hospital"

09:33.173 --> 09:34.573
Before going under for surgery.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.740
And that helps us how?

09:35.742 --> 09:38.610
It's a sign that there's
a memory in there.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.345
You never lose memories,

09:40.347 --> 09:42.013
Just the ability to access them.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.750
Did <i>you</i> go
to harvard medical school?

09:47.987 --> 09:49.821
Okay. Let's go.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.692
Eh, don't forget
your keys, boss.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.627
Happy:
Nice catch.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.030
How do you stand
working with them?

10:00.366 --> 10:01.766
They're an acquired taste.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.268
Doctor:
<i>Despite him looking normal,</i>

10:03.270 --> 10:04.636
<i>You need to be prepared.</i>

10:04.638 --> 10:06.805
His symptoms are
like those of dementia--

10:06.807 --> 10:09.808
Confusion, short-term
and long-term memory loss,

10:09.810 --> 10:12.077
Outbursts, anti-social
behavior, aggression...

10:12.079 --> 10:13.712
I can't blame the guy.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.879
He's former military,

10:14.881 --> 10:16.815
Charged with protecting
the president--

10:16.817 --> 10:17.782
Now he lives here?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.217
Man:
Get out of here, lady!

10:19.219 --> 10:21.186
(clatters)
paige:
Oh, my god.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.689
He's in a mood today.

10:25.925 --> 10:27.192
That better be pudding.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.296
What do you jerks want?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.867
Copy that.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.637
Norad's detected an ongoing
hack attempt right now.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.739
How's hacking
bruce's brain going?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.841
Well, toby's tried hierarchal
inference techniques,

10:42.843 --> 10:43.975
Recall exercises--

10:43.977 --> 10:45.810
He's down to
parlor tricks now.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.679
Counting down.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.914
Three, two, one.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.717
We're awake.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.687
You're back at the hospital.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.856
The shooting just happened.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.291
Images around you
are getting clearer.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.862
There's people
near the football.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.830
Now tell me what you see.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.033
I... See...

11:09.735 --> 11:11.169
...You got lips like a girl.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.837
That's it, I'm done
with this guy.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.372
Let me hit him with a wrench.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.907
Maybe it'll jar
something loose.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.242
Take it easy.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.410
He's sick.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.046
Bruce, you said
you'd try to remember.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.748
What do you remember, pops,
the alamo?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.917
I'm starting to
like happy's plan.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.753
I got to go, I got a briefing
with clinton in an hour.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.755
Walter, this is cruel.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.457
He still thinks
he's in secret service.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.793
Exactly.

11:34.795 --> 11:38.029
That means he still has access
to that time in his life.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
And there might be a way
to get him more lucid

11:40.701 --> 11:42.934
To remember it all,
but it is... It is dangerous.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.070
More dangerous
than a nuclear bomb?

11:45.072 --> 11:47.772
The research that I have been
doing for my sister has led me

11:47.774 --> 11:49.808
To some incredible papers
on extreme transcranial

11:49.810 --> 11:51.342
Direct current stimulation.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.778
You want to juice the guy?

11:53.780 --> 11:55.046
What do you mean, "juice him"?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.048
Apply this high-level
electric current

11:57.050 --> 11:58.950
To certain areas
of his brain to kick it

11:58.952 --> 12:01.019
To a substantially higher
function level.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.120
It makes people,
for a few hours,

12:02.122 --> 12:05.190
A much better version
of themselves--

12:05.192 --> 12:06.725
Their brains
more genius-like--

12:06.727 --> 12:08.293
Works faster--
and so do their bodies.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.795
If there is a memory
inside bruce that can help us,

12:10.797 --> 12:12.297
It might help to give it

12:12.299 --> 12:15.900
A little... Jolt.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.902
I don't think mr. Jones
is in any condition

12:17.904 --> 12:19.037
For something like that.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.073
You look like my aunt philomena.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.976
Take me home.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.112
What if one of us goes first,

12:27.114 --> 12:28.813
To show you it's safe?

12:29.982 --> 12:31.282
Bruce, you are a patriot.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.951
We're trying
to catch terrorists.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.389
Okay, great--
toby, I'll go first.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.390
(laughs sarcastically)

12:39.392 --> 12:41.059
Hell, no.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.061
Your neurons are packed
so densely,

12:43.063 --> 12:44.496
They could permanently fuse.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.831
Then jump-start me.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.168
This is effectively
experimental

12:50.170 --> 12:52.937
And definitely reckless,

12:52.939 --> 12:54.906
Especially to someone in
bruce's condition and to you.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.474
We have no choice.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.977
There's a nuclear silo
under cyber-attack.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.913
Finding the football is
the only shot to stop a launch.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.949
So wire me up.

13:06.485 --> 13:07.852
Is that a car battery?

13:07.854 --> 13:11.022
It's aaa approved,
so if we kill you,

13:11.024 --> 13:12.924
You get a free tow
to the morgue.

13:12.926 --> 13:13.992
Toby:
Okay,

13:13.994 --> 13:19.030
Your neurons' resting membrane
potential to depolarize,

13:19.032 --> 13:21.332
Which allows for
spontaneous cell firing.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.936
In short, your brain
is gonna work better.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.905
Or not at all.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.108
All right, we're ready,
so here we go.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.010
Happy?

13:32.012 --> 13:34.145
I'm not turning this thing on.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.181
It could end up being
a criminal act.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.016
You're the mechanic.
You're the doctor.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.017
Oh, for pete's sake.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.251
Remind me not to put you

13:40.253 --> 13:41.452
In charge of my living will.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.121
O-o-okay.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.957
I am gonna turn you up...

13:45.959 --> 13:47.325
Now.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.993
Somebody should be saying
this is crazy, right?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.228
'cause it is.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.599
Toby: Gonna start you
at 500 milliamps.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.035
Yep, yep.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.069
Feel that.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.370
Toby:
Sorry.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.073
It was just a tingle,
it's all right.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.142
Toby: Now I'm gonna
charge you up to 1,200.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.948
Okay, I think that's
been long enough.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.350
Yeah, there's a buzzing
in my head,

14:12.352 --> 14:14.919
And there's a taste
of metal in my mouth.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.387
Yeah, those are
normal side effects.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.989
Nothing normal about this.

14:17.991 --> 14:22.026
All right, I'm gonna
slowly dial you down now.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.969
Well, bruce,

14:30.971 --> 14:33.037
The good news is--

14:33.039 --> 14:34.372
I'm alive.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.375
The bad news is--
it didn't do anything.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.444
Cabe, think fast.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.252
Welcome to us.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.162
Toby: <i>You're wheeled</i>
<i>in on a gurney.</i>

14:58.164 --> 15:00.365
<i>Triage nurses are</i>
<i>barking orders.</i>

15:00.367 --> 15:03.935
Nurse 2:
Remove this case for me
so I can get the I.V. In.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.304
<i>Then they remove the football</i>
<i>to run an arterial line.</i>

15:08.540 --> 15:10.141
Nurse: Little bit sluggish.
Let's get him on the monitor.

15:15.614 --> 15:16.614
Someone picked it up.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.318
Hey, don't cut off
the juice, yet.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.621
Any more than that in a
three-day period could be fatal,

15:23.623 --> 15:25.256
Especially for him.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.591
What exactly did you see?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.927
I saw a man...

15:28.929 --> 15:30.061
W-with a blue finger.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.629
Regular hand, b-but...

15:31.631 --> 15:33.598
One blue finger.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
Like "my pen exploded
in my hand" blue,

15:35.602 --> 15:39.704
I don't know, cupcake,
it was, uh, it was blue.

15:39.706 --> 15:40.705
Bluish.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.473
I didn't see his face.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.578
There's too much
stuff coming at me.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.614
What the hell
did you guys do to me?

15:54.420 --> 15:56.154
Mapplethorpe?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.622
Wait, uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

15:57.624 --> 16:01.359
Was it... Was there
a mapplethorpe print

16:01.361 --> 16:02.627
On the wall?
Near the thief?

16:02.629 --> 16:03.995
I don't know.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.163
I'm so confused.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.498
The procedure can cause
neural backfires,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.734
These quick memory flashes,
visuals, sounds--

16:09.736 --> 16:12.236
It might be more intense
for someone with your condition.

16:12.238 --> 16:13.671
Give it time.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.641
Okay, leave him alone
for a beat.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.710
Why don't you come over here.

16:22.614 --> 16:25.183
What the hell does he mean,
a guy with one blue finger?

16:25.185 --> 16:27.652
Well, it's probably
not a glove design.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.654
It was 70 degrees the
day of the shooting.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.456
No one was wearing
hand gear.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.757
According to the report
merrick showed us,

16:32.759 --> 16:34.292
There were eight
kosovan bodyguards,

16:34.294 --> 16:36.461
Eight secret service,
two presidents,

16:36.463 --> 16:38.696
So almost 20 people
running around, diving.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.565
So in the mad scramble
after the shooting,

16:40.567 --> 16:44.302
A bruised or broken finger
could appear discolored.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.204
We need to see the hospital
records from that day.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.705
If someone got
a busted finger

16:47.707 --> 16:49.741
And got medical treatment,
that's our guy.

16:49.743 --> 16:51.709
Since this was an otr,
that would mean

16:51.711 --> 16:54.412
All the hospital records
would have been confiscated

16:54.414 --> 16:56.681
By the feds, but we'd still
have copies at homeland.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.750
Paige, you stay here,
make sure he's okay.

16:58.752 --> 17:02.520
You hang back in case bruce
gets worked up again.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.788
Let's go.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.128
Toby: What, these are all
off-the-record maneuvers

17:10.130 --> 17:11.129
No one knows about?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.563
We don't digitize it

17:12.565 --> 17:13.698
So guys like
you can hack in.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.233
I hate government.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.035
Then don't cash your
federal paycheck.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.037
Walter: Knee fractures,
forearm abrasions,

17:19.039 --> 17:21.806
Head sutures, no hand injuries.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.474
Merrick texted.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.476
Norad estimates that
the hackers will be in control

17:25.478 --> 17:27.678
Of the silo's mainframe
in less than two hours.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.613
Um, cabe...

17:28.615 --> 17:30.081
If the hackers do end up

17:30.083 --> 17:31.416
Launching, like,
a bunch of missiles,

17:31.418 --> 17:33.084
Will we, you know,
get a heads up?

17:33.086 --> 17:34.819
Because I got to figure
that l.A. Is a target,

17:34.821 --> 17:36.554
And I would not fare well
in an apocalypse.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.056
This is weird.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.824
Secret service agent
khara was given

17:39.826 --> 17:41.692
Nitroglycerin for
a preexisting heart condition

17:41.694 --> 17:44.095
Aggravated
by the shooting incident.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.164
Yeah, that's protocol
for cardiac episodes.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.534
In the secret service,
so why'd he lie to his doctor?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.702
Think I know.
Where you going?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.604
I can find out if agent
khara's our thief.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.073
I just need a bucket
of ice water.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.209
So what's it take for a guy

17:58.211 --> 17:59.710
To get something
to eat around here?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.449
Thanks, honey.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.784
I know he's sick, but if
he calls me "honey" again,

18:06.786 --> 18:08.119
I am gonna clock him.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.188
Take a breath.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.090
You and, uh, drew are
moving to portland?

18:13.192 --> 18:14.559
Toby eavesdropped again.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.363
No opinion on the matter?

18:20.332 --> 18:22.266
Well, portland's cold.

18:22.268 --> 18:26.337
Th-that is the same useless
information walter gave me.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.372
Okay, facts
aren't useless.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.374
They're the foundation
of rational thought.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.877
And I think ralph
will be bored there.

18:32.879 --> 18:36.214
Uh, well, you know,
I think...

18:36.216 --> 18:38.149
I think you geniuses
hide behind

18:38.151 --> 18:39.817
A pile of facts and figures

18:39.819 --> 18:41.486
When you don't want
to engage in something...

18:41.488 --> 18:44.755
Unpleasant, like the idea
of ralph and me leaving.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.725
The more something
bothers or scares you,

18:47.727 --> 18:49.794
The more you hide
behind data.

18:51.830 --> 18:52.830
Your sandwich is ready.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.133
Good talk.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.502
Bruce?

18:58.237 --> 18:59.837
Bruce...?

19:01.773 --> 19:03.774
Uh, happy...

19:03.776 --> 19:05.643
We may have a problem.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.145
What's going on?

19:07.147 --> 19:08.713
He's gone.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.847
You lost him?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.749
I was making a sandwich.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.720
Where is this guy?
I gotta go.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.721
Sylvester:
What?!

19:16.723 --> 19:18.156
Go where?

19:18.158 --> 19:20.892
To the bathroom.
I got my hand in ice water.

19:20.894 --> 19:23.227
That only works
with warm water.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.930
I'm about to disprove that myth
all over your leather interior.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.166
Homeland tracked the guy's
cell to this block.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.767
He'll turn up soon,
just be patient.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.636
Cabe:
Wow.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.804
Colors are so vibrant.
(chuckles)

19:33.806 --> 19:35.506
Toby: That's because the
recharge we gave you

19:35.508 --> 19:38.176
Has the electrical impulses
hitting the visual cortex

19:38.178 --> 19:40.745
Of your brain faster
than it has in decades.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.947
Oh. Oh, oh, oh,
there he is, there he is.

19:43.615 --> 19:44.949
Hey, hold this.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.653
Toby:
Hey, nalin!

19:48.655 --> 19:50.321
Nalin khara, right?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.323
Hey, it's tobias curtis.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.325
I worked with your brother
back in dc.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.593
Hi.
Hey.

19:55.595 --> 19:56.961
What are you doing?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.563
I'm dropping
your hand temperature.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.532
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand!
No.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.467
Cabe! Cabe!
Let go of my hand!

20:03.469 --> 20:05.469
Agent gallo, homeland security.

20:05.471 --> 20:06.971
Let this man hold your hand.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.506
What the hell?

20:08.508 --> 20:09.907
Don't worry, it doesn't mean
we're going steady.

20:10.943 --> 20:11.909
And...

20:11.911 --> 20:13.444
Oop, we're done.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.879
What's wrong with you, man?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.514
More like,
what's wrong with you?

20:16.516 --> 20:17.815
You got raynaud's
phenomenon.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.618
Vessel spasms that constrict
blood flow to a digit,

20:20.620 --> 20:24.555
That's triggered by direct cold
and stressful situations.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.824
Like stealing a very
important briefcase.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.961
Your condition was set off,
you got some nitroglycerin,

20:29.963 --> 20:31.662
And then you stole
the football.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.830
Toby:
We caught you, pal.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.732
Blue-handed.
Seriously?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.801
Been waiting an hour
to say that, sly, shut up.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.669
Okay, I will tell
you everything.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.004
But you need to understand...

20:40.006 --> 20:41.005
Hey, hey, hey!

20:41.007 --> 20:42.673
(car horn honks)

20:44.743 --> 20:46.911
Holy friggin' crap.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.846
His motor neurons are firing
on all cylinders from the juice.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.615
(horns honking)
it's like he's 25 again.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.626
Whatever you did to my brain...

21:01.628 --> 21:03.261
It worked.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.735
Cabe: Question I keep
going back to is:

21:10.737 --> 21:12.436
Why would
a secret service agent

21:12.438 --> 21:13.471
With a perfect record

21:13.473 --> 21:15.406
Steal the football?

21:22.514 --> 21:24.882
So, I did some digging
into someone

21:24.884 --> 21:27.485
We never even considered
16 years ago.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.821
At the time of the
assassination attempt,

21:30.823 --> 21:33.357
You still had
family in pakistan:

21:33.359 --> 21:36.594
Grandmother, two uncles,
despite having no priors,

21:36.596 --> 21:39.597
Were locked up
as political dissidents

21:39.599 --> 21:43.768
Then, in the months after
the football went missing,

21:43.770 --> 21:45.002
Charges were dropped.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.972
Someone found the weakness

21:47.974 --> 21:50.574
In a secret service agent,

21:50.576 --> 21:52.376
Targeted you,

21:52.378 --> 21:54.512
And made you do their bidding.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.416
Am I missing anything?

21:59.618 --> 22:00.951
Cabe:
I've got the pentagon

22:00.953 --> 22:02.787
Breathing down my
neck for updates,

22:02.789 --> 22:05.389
And the only lead we got to stop
nuclear winter isn't talking.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.525
And he won't.
He's motivated to
protect his family.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.893
If whoever's
behind these attacks

22:08.895 --> 22:10.861
Finds out he cooperated,
they're dead.

22:10.863 --> 22:13.030
I need you to dig into
your bag of tricks, walter.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.799
We need to find
a way to crack him.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.501
No luck at the pizza place.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.502
You?

22:18.504 --> 22:19.804
Zilch.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.572
Where do you go if
you're a former agent

22:21.574 --> 22:23.407
Who just got his
brain blasted?

22:23.409 --> 22:25.843
(phone ringing)

22:30.115 --> 22:32.016
Hey, walt.

22:32.018 --> 22:35.519
Yeah, get him together and
meet us at whitehull hospital.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.822
I have an idea. And hurry.
Happy: Okay.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.558
You didn't tell him
about bruce.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.460
I kind of want
to keep my job.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.828
We're screwed.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.967
This realty sign...

22:49.969 --> 22:51.435
"17 maplethorpe road."

22:51.437 --> 22:53.938
What bruce was mumbling about
after we juiced him.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.707
He was telling us
where he wanted to go.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.708
I'll drive!

22:57.710 --> 22:59.510
(engine revving)

23:04.683 --> 23:06.016
That was terrifying.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.486
I'm never letting you
drive my car again.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.720
I found him, didn't I?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.721
What the hell...?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.423
Man:
Already told you, sir.

23:12.425 --> 23:13.524
No one named lorraine
lives here.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.692
Hey...
It's okay.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.594
He's with us.
Take your damn hands off me.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.728
It's all right, bruce.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.830
Let's take a walk
and get a breath.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.399
Look, he means no harm.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.467
He just doesn't know where he is
sometimes-- he's sick.

23:23.469 --> 23:26.570
I'm not sick
at all... Right now.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.773
I just thought
she'd be here, that's all.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.642
That's why you duped us
and ran away?

23:31.644 --> 23:32.710
To see a girl?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.545
It's none of your
damn business.

23:34.547 --> 23:35.479
Doesn't matter, anyway.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.548
She's gone... Again.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.517
Who?

23:39.519 --> 23:42.753
Look, I'm grateful
that I got my mind back, okay?

23:42.755 --> 23:45.156
Short-lived though it may be.

23:45.158 --> 23:48.559
I just wish some of my memories
had stayed gone, I guess.

23:48.561 --> 23:49.560
Which memories?

23:49.562 --> 23:50.661
Who were you looking for here?

23:50.663 --> 23:52.730
Her name is lorraine.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.700
She was
a white house secretary.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.769
I liked her.

24:00.806 --> 24:01.872
I loved her.

24:03.675 --> 24:06.510
I didn't want her to see me
become what I am,

24:06.512 --> 24:08.512
So I... I asked 'em

24:08.514 --> 24:10.781
If I could take my treatment
out here in los angeles,

24:10.783 --> 24:12.516
And I, uh...

24:12.518 --> 24:14.852
I left without saying a word.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.455
I heard she moved out
here some time back.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.689
I never checked
up, but, uh...

24:18.691 --> 24:23.627
Now that some of my memories
are coming back...

24:23.629 --> 24:28.032
It's like it's happening
to me all over again.

24:28.034 --> 24:31.135
It's as... Painful
as it was the first time.

24:33.605 --> 24:35.706
Just take me home, okay?
Please?

24:37.576 --> 24:40.611
About that...

24:40.613 --> 24:42.580
The magnetoencephalography
machine

24:42.582 --> 24:44.215
Will map when your
memories are activated.

24:44.217 --> 24:45.683
Tech:
Almost set.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.952
Can you guys tell me
what the emergency is?

24:47.954 --> 24:49.887
Like, um, is this guy
a spy or something?

24:49.889 --> 24:51.956
That's need-to-know.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.528
Y-you know, this-this
isn't going to work, guys.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.797
I've already told you
everything I can recall.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.799
No, I know, but sometimes

25:01.801 --> 25:04.235
Memories can be awoken
with the proper stimulant.

25:04.237 --> 25:06.704
All right,
tell me, bruce,

25:06.706 --> 25:08.138
Do you recognize
this guy?

25:09.708 --> 25:10.641
No.

25:11.643 --> 25:13.544
Take a closer look...

25:14.513 --> 25:15.513
...And try aging him down

25:15.515 --> 25:17.581
About 16 years.

25:18.617 --> 25:19.783
Khara?

25:19.785 --> 25:22.186
Is that you?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.723
I don't remember
the last time I saw you.

25:27.726 --> 25:30.528
The last time you saw him...

25:30.530 --> 25:32.663
Was when he stole
the football, bruce.

25:35.634 --> 25:38.035
You son of a bitch.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.937
You took it
all from me.

25:39.939 --> 25:43.107
You took my career,

25:43.109 --> 25:45.609
You took my life!

25:45.611 --> 25:46.744
You took her!

25:46.746 --> 25:48.312
Focus on his hand, bruce.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.948
Focus-- allow your memories
of that day to return.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.216
You're in the hospital,

25:52.218 --> 25:53.884
You're getting
prepped for surgery...

25:53.886 --> 25:55.019
One line of saline, wide open!

25:55.021 --> 25:58.155
Then a hand reached down
and took that case.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.293
Toby:
It was khara.

26:02.295 --> 26:03.894
You saw him.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.262
What happens now?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.897
Doctor:
Gsw to the torso!

26:08.767 --> 26:10.568
I don't know.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.136
Uh, y-yes, you do.

26:12.138 --> 26:16.774
He's not gonna tell us,
so you need to.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.742
I can't... I can't remember.
I'm sorry.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.311
The man doesn't know anything.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.779
Just let him be and move on.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.714
Khara: There's nothing
any of us can do now.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.182
It's done.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.084
It's done.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.319
What did you just say?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.254
Bingo.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.222
Okay, talk to me, bruce.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.757
Tell me, what did
you remember?

26:33.759 --> 26:36.794
Nurse: Little bit sluggish.
Let's get him on the monitor.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.596
He was leaving...

26:39.998 --> 26:41.231
<i>...Then he called someone.</i>

26:41.233 --> 26:42.800
I heard him.

26:44.135 --> 26:45.803
It's done.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.237
Come on, focus, bruce.
What did you hear?

26:47.239 --> 26:48.739
I heard sounds.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.074
Uh-uh... Tones.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.842
Like tones from dialing a phone?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.077
I think so.

26:53.979 --> 26:55.379
Okay, hold that thought!

26:55.381 --> 26:57.848
(muzak playing)

26:57.850 --> 27:02.920
Bruce heard khara place a call
to his conspirator... Then,

27:02.922 --> 27:04.121
All we need to do

27:04.123 --> 27:05.656
Is reverse engineer
the number he dialed

27:05.658 --> 27:07.891
And that should lead us
to whoever has the case.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.693
How can you
possibly identify

27:09.695 --> 27:12.763
Push-button tones
16 years later?

27:12.765 --> 27:15.032
His memory's tucked away
in a cranial fold somewhere.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.867
Everything you read,
see, or hear--

27:16.869 --> 27:18.702
It's stored away,
like in a computer,

27:18.704 --> 27:20.404
And we just need to
access that file.

27:20.406 --> 27:23.140
Is all of this really necessary?

27:23.142 --> 27:24.341
Sylvester:
Sensory recreation stimuli

27:24.343 --> 27:26.710
To get you back to
the exact place you were

27:26.712 --> 27:28.212
Where the football was stolen.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.214
Similar suit
to what you were wearing,

27:30.216 --> 27:32.216
Hospital muzak...

27:32.218 --> 27:34.218
What the hell?
Toby:
Oh, it's iodine.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.286
They used this
to prep you for surgery.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.389
The olfactory sense is
the strongest memory trigger.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.290
Since we juiced you,
your temporal lobe

27:40.292 --> 27:41.859
Has just been itching
to reminisce with us.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.027
We just gotta goose it.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.862
So, bruce, close your eyes,

27:44.864 --> 27:46.130
Exhale...

27:46.132 --> 27:48.265
(inhales, exhales)

27:48.267 --> 27:49.767
...Focus.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.869
Walter:
Assume khara dialed local.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.271
Cell phones weren't prevalent
16 years ago,

27:54.273 --> 27:55.839
And he wasn't gonna
overnight the football, so...

27:55.841 --> 27:59.743
The most popular area codes
in l.A. At the time were

27:59.745 --> 28:04.815
323, 310, and 213.

28:04.817 --> 28:05.983
(three tones sound)

28:07.686 --> 28:09.720
(a different trio
of tones sound)

28:09.722 --> 28:13.323
(three tones sound)
nurse: Little bit sluggish.
Let's get him on the monitor.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.459
Any of those sound familiar?

28:15.461 --> 28:16.994
The first one.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.295
323 it is.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.764
Seven more
mystery numbers to go.

28:20.766 --> 28:21.765
(one tone sounds)

28:21.767 --> 28:23.333
No.

28:23.335 --> 28:26.770
Toby: <i>Concentrate on</i>
<i>his phone... Just the phone.</i>

28:26.772 --> 28:29.373
(one tone sounds)
let's get him on the monitor.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.474
Yes.

28:33.311 --> 28:34.211
(two tones sound)

28:34.213 --> 28:35.079
Yes.

28:36.748 --> 28:37.848
(one tone sounds)
that one.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.218
(tone sounds)
bruce: No...

28:41.220 --> 28:42.753
(another tone sounds)
yes.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.789
Walter:
323-248-8049.

28:45.791 --> 28:46.924
We got it!

28:46.926 --> 28:48.225
We just gotta find
out who that number

28:48.227 --> 28:49.226
Belonged to 16 years ago.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.862
I'm working on it.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.130
Cabe:
Update!

28:53.132 --> 28:56.467
Hackers are into
the icelandic silo.

28:56.469 --> 28:58.001
The nuclear
launch sequence

28:58.003 --> 28:59.837
Has been activated for a missile

28:59.839 --> 29:01.972
Aimed at st. Petersburg, russia.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.441
<i>Right now, personnel</i>
<i>are doing all they can</i>

29:04.443 --> 29:06.076
<i>To stop the missiles.</i>
<i>They will fail.</i>

29:06.078 --> 29:07.244
Walter:
<i>How long do we have?</i>

29:07.246 --> 29:09.880
T-minus 30
until ready for launch.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.220
So, in 30 minutes,
all the terrorists need to do

29:16.222 --> 29:18.222
Is push a button in a briefcase?

29:18.224 --> 29:22.092
It's logical. It's brilliant.
For decades,

29:22.094 --> 29:23.293
Terrorists
have been fighting us,

29:23.295 --> 29:24.261
Getting knocked down,
rebuilding,

29:24.263 --> 29:25.529
Then coming back at us.

29:25.531 --> 29:28.866
But if a u.S. Nuke
hits a russian city--

29:28.868 --> 29:30.534
They're gonna sit back

29:30.536 --> 29:31.935
And watch us destroy each other.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.537
There's only one way
to fix this.

29:33.539 --> 29:37.441
To do that, we need to know
what that phone number leads to.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.811
Got it! It belongs to
a defunct non-profit

29:40.813 --> 29:43.781
That takes care of poor
middle eastern children.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.049
Well, it's not the first time
that a fake charity

29:46.051 --> 29:48.285
Has been used to launder money
for a terrorist group.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.454
This one's headed up
by one nadim gadhi.

29:50.456 --> 29:51.889
Last known address?

29:51.891 --> 29:54.091
Sylvester: He's in a boathouse
at the harbor.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.926
19 minutes away.
By the time we arrive,

29:55.928 --> 29:59.129
Until the nukes are ready to go.
We gotta move!

30:04.369 --> 30:05.435
(tires screech)

30:07.906 --> 30:09.306
Cops are a few minutes out.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.808
Walter, bruce-- need you.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.109
Toby, need you

30:12.111 --> 30:13.844
In case bruce has any issues.

30:13.846 --> 30:14.845
The rest of you,
remain alert.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.265
("chicken dance" ringtone
playing loudly)

30:36.467 --> 30:38.468
(phone stops ringing)

30:38.470 --> 30:40.604
You're the one who wanted me
to keep my phone on.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.039
(gun clicking in distance)

30:42.041 --> 30:44.007
(gunfire)

30:46.077 --> 30:48.612
Homeland! Freeze!

30:49.881 --> 30:51.949
You all right?
Fine. Let's go.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.896
Game on!

31:05.898 --> 31:06.997
Oh, god, she's driving again.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.232
Happy, I'm not buckled.
Just wait!

31:08.234 --> 31:09.499
Wait till I'm buckled!
I'm not buckled!

31:09.501 --> 31:11.301
<i>Happy, happy, happy!</i>
<i>Safety first!</i>

31:11.303 --> 31:13.103
<i>What did we talk about?</i>
<i>(engine revving)</i>

31:32.357 --> 31:34.524
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

31:38.296 --> 31:40.964
If we split up,
we cover more ground.

31:40.966 --> 31:43.033
All right.
Okay.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.004
(grunts)

32:21.006 --> 32:24.308
We got less than two minutes.
We gotta get that case.

32:31.983 --> 32:34.551
Homeland! Freeze!

32:34.553 --> 32:37.220
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!

32:37.222 --> 32:39.556
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

32:39.558 --> 32:40.724
Put down the case.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.960
Set down the case
and step away from it!

32:51.469 --> 32:53.370
Cabe: Set down the case
and step away from it!

32:53.372 --> 32:56.273
(train whistle blowing,
crossing bell clanging)

32:56.275 --> 33:00.177
No! No!

33:00.179 --> 33:02.412
Toby, stop! It's electrified!

33:02.414 --> 33:03.981
Best thing about america?

33:03.983 --> 33:06.483
The trains always run on time.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.686
(horn blowing)

33:09.688 --> 33:11.655
In less than a minute,
those nukes are ready to launch.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.724
If that train runs over the
case, the button will depress.

33:13.726 --> 33:15.158
Walter:
And millions will die.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.494
(train horn blasting)

33:17.496 --> 33:18.729
All right,
the fence is electrified.

33:18.731 --> 33:20.163
We can't climb it.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.498
Happy, where's
the nearest junction box?

33:21.500 --> 33:22.733
It's on the other side
of the yard.

33:22.735 --> 33:25.402
It's a quarter mile down
and around the fence.

33:25.404 --> 33:28.505
To get down there, but due to
the speed of the train,

33:28.507 --> 33:30.540
We only have 45 seconds, walter!

33:30.542 --> 33:32.275
(train horn blaring,
switch clacking)

33:38.383 --> 33:39.483
I've got an idea!

33:39.485 --> 33:42.786
That magnet's strong enough
to stop that train!

33:42.788 --> 33:45.756
And that case is aluminum,
it's not magnetic!

33:45.758 --> 33:47.657
Of course! The track is
lined with intermittent

33:47.659 --> 33:50.427
Shoe brakes that'll stop the
train in case of an emergency.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.296
It's activated
by electromagnetic coils.

33:53.298 --> 33:54.564
She's using the magnet
to reverse polarities

33:54.566 --> 33:56.099
And flip the switch!

33:56.768 --> 33:59.069
(horn blowing)

34:16.454 --> 34:18.255
Time's up-- missiles
are ready for launch!

34:31.169 --> 34:33.537
Uh...

34:33.539 --> 34:34.604
You did it!

34:37.642 --> 34:39.576
(siren whoops,
indistinct radio communication)

34:41.479 --> 34:44.448
The launch sequence has been
shut down and the feds

34:44.450 --> 34:46.650
Have tracked gadhi's
online communications.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.619
Interpol's picking up his
pals overseas as we speak.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.321
Feel free to take a bow.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.190
You all just saved the world.

34:54.258 --> 34:56.426
And you took me
out of the line of fire

34:56.428 --> 34:57.494
Like I was potus.

34:58.629 --> 35:01.465
You're still a
hell of an agent.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.668
My orders are
to dispose of this.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.637
And we are to act
like this never happened.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.605
Otr.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.607
O... T... R.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.813
Do the honors.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.525
Bruce:
I've been tough on you.

35:28.527 --> 35:29.526
Go get 'em.

35:29.528 --> 35:30.827
Bruce:
Let's see what you got.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.396
Okay-okay, okay.
Yeah!

35:33.398 --> 35:35.532
Okay.

35:36.567 --> 35:39.536
(sighing):
Okay...

35:42.206 --> 35:43.306
That's it. Mm-hmm.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.875
(grunts)

35:45.910 --> 35:47.711
That felt good.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.646
Sexy man!

35:49.648 --> 35:51.548
All right, let's
pack it up and head home.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.617
Shotgun.

35:56.854 --> 35:58.622
Come on.

35:58.624 --> 35:59.756
Walter: You were
pretty incredible today.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.592
Only because you
juiced my brain.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.694
You know, I work out,

36:04.696 --> 36:06.263
Try to take care of myself.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.565
It never crosses my mind
I'm getting older.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.634
But you never know how far
you slipped down that mountain

36:10.636 --> 36:13.303
Till you look back up and
see where you once were.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.338
Enjoy your youth
while you can, kid.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.674
One day you'll blink...

36:17.676 --> 36:19.476
You'll be me.

36:20.945 --> 36:23.213
You know, I hate to spoil

36:23.215 --> 36:25.315
Your moment of self-reflection,

36:25.317 --> 36:28.652
But what we did to you
wore off hours ago.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.954
Your heroics out here--

36:30.956 --> 36:32.656
That was all you.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.391
You don't say.

36:50.641 --> 36:52.742
I protected the
president once.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.345
Thank you for allowing me

36:55.347 --> 36:57.347
To feel useful again.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.749
I wish I could say
I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...

36:59.751 --> 37:01.718
There's advancements in
neurological science every year.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.886
You never know.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.521
Yes, I do.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.789
And so do you.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.859
Make as many great
memories as you can.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.728
'cause at the end of the day,

37:11.730 --> 37:14.464
We don't get to decide
the ones we keep, huh?

37:24.842 --> 37:27.711
Lorraine?!

37:27.713 --> 37:29.746
H-how did you...?

37:29.748 --> 37:32.649
We just found
a terrorist after 16 years.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.818
We can find a secretary.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.686
She's a strong memory in you.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.555
Maybe having her back
in your life

37:38.557 --> 37:41.458
Will help you hold on
a little more.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.994
Well, I'm gonna try.

37:45.296 --> 37:47.364
I'm gonna try like hell.

38:16.661 --> 38:19.796
How about we hold off
cleaning until tomorrow, huh?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.731
I second that motion.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.633
Hear, hear.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.470
Paige:
Thanks.

38:28.906 --> 38:30.840
Crazy day, huh?

38:30.842 --> 38:34.077
(quiet laugh)
crazy seems to be the norm.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.746
That's an astute observation.
(anxious laugh)

38:36.748 --> 38:38.882
I, um... My assessment

38:38.884 --> 38:41.484
Of portland, uh, was, um,

38:41.486 --> 38:45.388
Not the proper response
for your query.

38:45.390 --> 38:46.089
Oh.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.692
Okay.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.328
Yeah, I thought it might also
be useful for you to know that

38:51.330 --> 38:53.830
The university of
southern maine also has,

38:53.832 --> 38:57.067
Um, solid research facilities--

38:57.069 --> 38:59.836
Not like ucla, but solid--

38:59.838 --> 39:01.404
So it might be good for ralph.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.341
Also they have
oceanography clubs for minors.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.776
Uh, average snowfall
is 61 inches.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.378
There are over 3,000...

39:08.380 --> 39:11.348
Uh, islands off the coast,
so ralph could explore,

39:11.350 --> 39:14.451
And-and-and it also brings in
90% of the nation's lobster,

39:14.453 --> 39:15.985
So, you know, crustaceans--
I'm sorry. Is this...

39:15.987 --> 39:17.954
(stammers)
...Funny?

39:17.956 --> 39:22.625
No. It's just a lot
of facts and figures.

39:22.627 --> 39:25.128
Of course.
I care about giving you

39:25.130 --> 39:27.497
A complete answer
to your question.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.366
Oh, I know.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.368
I know you care.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.573
No. You know,
I, um, I care about, um,

39:36.575 --> 39:39.809
More than just
you having the,

39:39.811 --> 39:42.712
Um, the facts and-and...

39:42.714 --> 39:45.949
Full statistics for ralph.
I, um...

39:45.951 --> 39:47.884
I care about ralph.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.853
You were right.

39:49.855 --> 39:50.987
I don't,

39:50.989 --> 39:53.556
Um, I never had a real

39:53.558 --> 39:54.924
Relationship with my father.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.893
And I know I'm not ralph's,

39:56.895 --> 39:59.429
But I-I must serve...

39:59.431 --> 40:01.831
A purpose in his life,
because he serves

40:01.833 --> 40:04.934
Such an important, uh,
one in mine,

40:04.936 --> 40:07.437
And if he left, then, uh...

40:07.439 --> 40:09.973
I-I know I said

40:09.975 --> 40:12.409
Being human wasn't

40:12.411 --> 40:14.043
Something I wanted.

40:14.045 --> 40:16.079
But since I met your son,

40:16.081 --> 40:18.515
I know that's
not entirely true.

40:18.517 --> 40:21.951
These last few months,
I've been... Less me.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.421
And that's made me
a better person.

40:26.023 --> 40:27.991
So, no, I don't
want him to leave.

40:30.895 --> 40:33.830
I, uh...

40:33.832 --> 40:35.131
Care about him.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.002
And you.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.139
Those are the last facts
that I have to say.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.508
And, well, yeah, so, okay.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.911
Walter?

40:47.913 --> 40:49.846
Yeah?

40:52.483 --> 40:54.150
I'd miss you, too.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.587
Hey!

40:57.589 --> 40:59.656
Look, mom. Check it out!

40:59.658 --> 41:00.957
Drew:
Guess who won the science fair.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.526
No way!

41:03.528 --> 41:04.961
That's incredible!

41:04.963 --> 41:07.997
Billy from class
asked me to his birthday.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.165
Can I go?

41:09.167 --> 41:11.768
You were invited to a party?

41:13.037 --> 41:14.704
Of course you can go.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.674
Hey, what do you say
we give this engine a kick?

41:17.676 --> 41:19.876
I mean... Unless you're
in a rush to go?

41:19.878 --> 41:22.111
No.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.147
No, I don't want to go.

41:26.884 --> 41:30.086
Okay, let's go.

41:38.262 --> 41:39.529
