01:14.641 --> 01:15.641
Hi.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.644
A book. Nothing.

01:20.647 --> 01:21.647
A book.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.148
What book?

01:23.149 --> 01:24.650
Nothing. It's boring.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.151
I don't even know.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.653
What is that?
Is that a dirty book?

01:27.654 --> 01:29.154
No, it's not
a dirty book. Huh?

01:29.155 --> 01:31.156
Come on, Danny.
It's my book. Let me see it.

01:31.157 --> 01:32.157
You got a dirty book there?

01:32.158 --> 01:33.659
Don't... Come on.
Give me that book.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.660
Give me that book.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.162
Give it to me.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.169
<i>Die Without Fear?</i>

01:44.170 --> 01:45.671
Bullfighting.

01:48.174 --> 01:51.677
I was going to take it up,
and I-I just changed my mind.

01:55.682 --> 01:59.184
It's a terrible book, Danny.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.687
No laughs.

02:01.688 --> 02:05.190
Oh, Burt, no.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.692
No.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.203
No one knows.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.706
Danny...

02:20.707 --> 02:21.707
Danny.

02:21.708 --> 02:22.708
Danny, no one knows,
you hear me?

02:22.709 --> 02:23.709
No one.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.711
Danny, I don't want
anybody to know.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.212
No one knows, Dan.
No one.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.213
No one?

02:28.214 --> 02:29.214
No one.

02:29.215 --> 02:30.215
Ma!

02:30.216 --> 02:31.216
No.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.217
Come over here.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.218
No, Danny, please.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.219
No one.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.721
I don't want anyone to know.

02:35.722 --> 02:36.722
Promise me. Come on.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.223
Danny.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.225
Come on, swear.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.727
No one?

02:44.230 --> 02:45.731
I swear.

02:50.236 --> 02:51.737
What can I do?

02:51.738 --> 02:54.239
Is there anything I can do?

02:54.240 --> 02:56.241
Take care of your mother.
And the baby.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.744
I need you to take care
of your mother and the baby.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.245
I will.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.246
I will, Burt.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.248
And you run the business
the way I showed you.

03:03.249 --> 03:05.751
No days off when it drizzles.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.753
Oh, Burt.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.255
Because I'm going
to be watching.

03:10.256 --> 03:13.759
Bet you can.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.761
Dan, I bet you can watch.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.763
Probably can't say anything,
but I bet you can watch.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.265
Sure hope you can.

03:20.266 --> 03:21.767
Burt, if you can,

03:21.768 --> 03:23.769
if there is a life after,
will you let me know?

03:23.770 --> 03:25.771
What should I do,
pick up the phone and call?

03:25.772 --> 03:26.773
What?

03:28.274 --> 03:29.274
Or write.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.277
Mm-hmm.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.285
Listen, uh...

03:40.286 --> 03:42.288
there's nothing
that they could do?

03:45.792 --> 03:47.292
Did you see a doctor?

03:47.293 --> 03:50.295
No, I diagnosed it myself.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.798
Burt, you may have made
a mistake.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.803
No, Danny,
of course I saw the doctor.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.806
Well, that explains
why you've been missing work.

04:03.810 --> 04:04.810
Oh, Burt...

04:04.811 --> 04:06.311
Come on, Dan.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.813
Come on.

04:07.814 --> 04:08.814
The only thing
that really bothers me

04:08.815 --> 04:10.816
is I never left my mark.

04:10.817 --> 04:11.817
You know, and, uh...

04:11.818 --> 04:14.319
I mean,
I'm not leaving anything behind.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.320
Sure you are.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.822
What?

04:16.822 --> 04:18.322
The Murray Hill Condos.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.825
Oh, no, no, no, Danny.

04:19.826 --> 04:22.828
No, I mean,
something special, you know?

04:22.829 --> 04:25.330
Something so that, like,
years from now,

04:25.331 --> 04:27.332
the name of Burt Campbell
might get mentioned,

04:27.333 --> 04:28.834
you know, sometimes.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.335
I'll talk about you.

04:30.336 --> 04:31.837
I know, Dan.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.838
I don't mean that, Danny.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.339
I mean, uh...

04:35.341 --> 04:38.343
Listen, I'll tell you something
if you promise not to laugh.

04:38.344 --> 04:39.845
Promise.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.849
I want to get into
the <i>Guinness Book of Records.</i>

04:44.851 --> 04:45.851
Huh?

04:45.852 --> 04:46.852
Hey.

04:46.853 --> 04:47.853
Huh?

04:47.854 --> 04:48.854
What do think of that?

04:48.855 --> 04:50.355
Fattest man.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.857
You could be the fattest man

04:51.858 --> 04:53.358
before you die.

04:53.359 --> 04:54.359
How long have you got?

04:54.360 --> 04:55.861
Five months.
That's not enough time.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.363
Stop eating.
Be the thinnest man.

04:58.364 --> 04:59.865
I won't live five months.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.366
Tallest man.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.368
Danny, I'm not growing anymore.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.371
Is that part of the disease?

05:08.374 --> 05:09.875
No, Danny.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.378
Five months, huh?

05:13.379 --> 05:14.379
Well, it's a cinch

05:14.380 --> 05:15.881
you're not going to be
the oldest man.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.384
Hey.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.385
Hey, look at this.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.387
Hey, this is great.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.389
Highest temperature
ever endured by a human,

05:24.390 --> 05:25.390
400 degrees.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.391
That's it!

05:26.392 --> 05:29.895
You will endure 425.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.897
What will I do,
dress light and sit in the oven?

05:31.898 --> 05:33.900
Yeah.
Sit down, Danny.

05:37.904 --> 05:38.904
Hey.

05:38.905 --> 05:39.905
Hey, here it is.

05:39.906 --> 05:40.906
Standing up.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.908
I can do that.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.410
The longest time
a man has remained standing,

05:45.411 --> 05:47.412
17 years.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.414
I have five months.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.916
Maybe standing on one foot.

05:50.917 --> 05:51.917
Give me the book, please.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.418
Hey, how about staying up, Burt?

05:53.419 --> 05:54.920
You got insomnia anyway.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.421
This, huh?

05:56.422 --> 05:58.924
Grape catching.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.425
The longest recorded distance

06:00.426 --> 06:02.427
for catching a thrown grape
in the mouth

06:02.428 --> 06:05.430
is 259 feet.

06:05.431 --> 06:06.431
Let's try it.

06:06.432 --> 06:07.432
All right, here.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.934
Get over there.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.936
Danny, this is like 12, 15 feet.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.437
Well, we'll work our way up.

06:12.438 --> 06:13.939
All right, let's go.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.444
Come on.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.448
What are you doing?

06:23.449 --> 06:24.950
What are you doing?

06:24.951 --> 06:28.453
Aah!

06:28.454 --> 06:29.454
What?

06:29.455 --> 06:30.455
Oh, my eye.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.957
Can you open it?

06:31.958 --> 06:32.958
You got me in the eye.

06:32.959 --> 06:33.959
Oh, God, Burt, I'm sorry.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.460
This is great.

06:35.461 --> 06:36.461
I got five months to live.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.463
I'm not going to see any of it.

06:38.464 --> 06:41.466
Hey, Burt, how about
the longest distance

06:41.467 --> 06:42.968
a blind man can drive a car

06:42.969 --> 06:44.469
without hitting something?

06:44.470 --> 06:46.972
I'm dying in five months.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.974
Is that not fast enough for you?

06:48.975 --> 06:49.975
How about the longest

06:49.976 --> 06:51.476
a man can not
go to the bathroom?

06:51.477 --> 06:53.478
How about the longest
you keep your mouth shut?

06:53.479 --> 06:54.479
Get away from me, Danny.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.981
Burt...

07:00.987 --> 07:03.488
♪ Up came the sun
And dried up all the rain ♪

07:03.489 --> 07:07.493
♪ And the itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the spout again ♪

07:08.995 --> 07:11.496
That's my big boy.

07:11.497 --> 07:12.497
Hi.

07:12.498 --> 07:13.498
Hi.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.000
Do I have to be quiet?

07:15.001 --> 07:16.001
Oh, don't worry.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.502
He sleeps like a log.

07:17.503 --> 07:21.506
Oh, so he is such
a beautiful baby, Corinne.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.008
I think he's the most
beautiful baby

07:23.009 --> 07:24.009
I've ever seen.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.510
Thank you.

07:25.511 --> 07:29.514
Oh, except for his ears,
he's perfect.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.516
That and his nose.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.519
What's the matter
with his ears and nose?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.521
Nothing's the matter
with his ears and nose.

07:36.522 --> 07:40.025
They just aren't
the classic Tate ears and nose.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.027
Well, his father is a Flotsky

07:42.028 --> 07:43.028
and his mother is adopted,

07:43.029 --> 07:45.530
so I don't wonder.

07:45.531 --> 07:46.531
Oh, well,
apart from that, darling,

07:46.532 --> 07:48.033
he is gorgeous.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.534
Well, it was really nice of you

07:49.535 --> 07:50.535
to drop in, Eunice.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.037
Oh, Corinne, I was wondering

07:52.038 --> 07:54.539
if you could
do me a little favor. What?

07:54.540 --> 07:55.540
Well, I have a date tonight,

07:55.541 --> 07:57.542
and I told Dutch

07:57.543 --> 07:59.044
that you're sneaking around
with a married man

07:59.045 --> 08:02.047
and that you asked me
to bring him this note,

08:02.048 --> 08:03.548
so would you do that for me?

08:03.549 --> 08:05.050
Eunice, how dare you?

08:05.051 --> 08:06.051
Oh, come on.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.052
I covered for you lots of times.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.554
But I never asked you
to tarnish your reputation.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.056
Your reputation
isn't going to be tarnished,

08:11.057 --> 08:14.059
and even if it was,
who could tell?

08:14.060 --> 08:16.561
I should lie,

08:16.562 --> 08:18.563
so that you can go out
with Eric?

08:18.564 --> 08:20.065
Eric? Oh, please.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.067
I'm not seeing Eric anymore.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.568
Eric...

08:23.569 --> 08:28.573
Corinne, I'm seeing somebody
really special.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.075
Jerry.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.580
What happened to Eric?

08:35.581 --> 08:38.582
Dutch found out where he lived
and had a little chat with him,

08:38.583 --> 08:40.085
and sort of clarified
the situation,

08:40.086 --> 08:41.586
if you know what I mean.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.087
So where is he?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.590
In Montana, herding sheep.

08:45.591 --> 08:46.591
Oh, come on, Corinne.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.093
Will you help me?
Please?

08:48.094 --> 08:49.094
You've done
the same thing I'm doing,

08:49.095 --> 08:50.595
lots of times.

08:50.596 --> 08:53.098
I never ran around
behind my boyfriend's back.

08:53.099 --> 08:56.602
Oh, you were never off your back
long enough to run around.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.605
At least the only leather
I ever get into

09:00.606 --> 09:02.107
is my shoes.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.110
Ooh! Corinne.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.111
All right, Eunice,

09:06.112 --> 09:07.612
I'll do this for you
this one time,

09:07.613 --> 09:10.615
but never, ever ask me to do
anything like this ever again.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.117
Oh, I promise, never.
I never will.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.618
Thank you, Corinne.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.120
Fine.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.623
Oh, Corinne,
can I borrow your blue dress?

09:32.638 --> 09:33.638
Hi.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.640
Hi.

09:35.641 --> 09:38.143
Where's your father?

09:38.144 --> 09:40.145
Baptizing the Johnson twins.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.146
Oh.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.649
Come on in.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.152
His office called

09:47.153 --> 09:49.154
and said that the group
encounter session

09:49.155 --> 09:50.655
was at this address.

09:50.656 --> 09:51.656
We're it.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.161
We're what?

09:58.164 --> 10:00.165
God, you are handsome.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.667
Oh...

10:05.171 --> 10:06.171
Excuse me?

10:06.172 --> 10:07.672
I made the call.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.675
We're the session.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.182
Should have brought
my pith helmet.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.684
Scotch?

10:19.685 --> 10:21.686
Uh, no, no. Thanks.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.688
Look, uh, Gloria,

10:23.689 --> 10:24.690
I don't...

10:27.193 --> 10:29.194
I don't know what
you've got on your mind,

10:29.195 --> 10:30.695
but, uh...

10:30.696 --> 10:31.696
Gloria...

10:31.697 --> 10:33.198
Hold me.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.200
Not a good idea.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.202
No, that's not really
a good idea.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.704
You... You... You see,
I'm trying to be good,

10:39.705 --> 10:41.706
and this is no good

10:41.707 --> 10:43.208
if you're trying to be good...

10:46.712 --> 10:49.214
No, no, no.

10:52.218 --> 10:55.220
I don't do that anymore.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.221
It's got to stop.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.223
I'm ruining my life
with this kind of thing.

10:58.224 --> 10:59.224
The time to stop is now.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.725
Now is the time.

11:00.726 --> 11:03.728
God, my timing is terrible.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.230
I want you.

11:05.231 --> 11:06.231
No, Gloria,
I've come here for help.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.233
No, I-I need help.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.236
I'll help.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.240
Should have brought
the Dramamine.

11:15.241 --> 11:17.242
Don't you think I'm attractive?

11:17.243 --> 11:18.743
You kidding?

11:18.744 --> 11:20.245
I couldn't take my eyes off you

11:20.246 --> 11:22.247
the first time I saw you.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.250
Uh, is there anything on TV?

11:34.760 --> 11:37.262
Oh, my.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.764
That's incredible.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.765
You can't tell

11:40.766 --> 11:44.269
where one person ends
and another begins.

11:45.771 --> 11:47.772
Don't you want to see
how it turns out?

11:47.773 --> 11:50.775
Oh, I can imagine.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.277
Ah, I've got it.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.778
This is a test, right?
I am being tested.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.781
Your father said every man
is tested every day of his life,

11:56.782 --> 11:57.782
and this is my little test.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.284
Oh, Chester...

11:59.285 --> 12:01.787
Hope it doesn't turn out
to be multiple choice.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.290
I want you.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.292
Look, Gloria, please,
I've come for help.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.793
I'm old enough
to be your father.

12:08.794 --> 12:09.794
No, please.

12:09.795 --> 12:10.795
Don't. Don't.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.297
No, don't.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.298
Don't. Please.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.799
You're nibbling my ear, Gloria.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
Please don't nibble.

12:15.801 --> 12:18.804
Oh, God, I'm being nibbled.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.310
Gloria, I have
come here for help.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.811
I am falling from grace.

12:26.812 --> 12:27.812
Gloria, I'm falling.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.315
See, I need help, Gloria.

12:30.316 --> 12:31.316
I need help.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.818
Help.

12:44.550 --> 12:45.830
Burt, Polly
and her entire family

12:45.831 --> 12:47.332
are going to be here
any minute now.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.833
Must you do that?

12:48.834 --> 12:50.335
Danny, come on, please.
Give me a break.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.337
I've been at this
almost 26 straight hours now.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.839
I'm trying to establish
a world record.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.841
Come on, Dan, I can't just stop

12:56.842 --> 12:58.843
because suddenly
company's coming over.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.345
Well, uh,
what about bathroom breaks?

13:00.346 --> 13:01.846
They give you bathroom breaks,
don't they?

13:01.847 --> 13:03.848
Yeah.
Good.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.350
Take one
for about three hours, okay?

13:05.351 --> 13:07.352
Danny,
I don't take bathroom breaks.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.354
It ruins my concentration.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.356
You mean you haven't gone
in 26 hours?

13:11.357 --> 13:14.359
That's probably a record
right there.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.361
Danny, of course I've gone.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.362
I figured out a way

13:17.363 --> 13:20.865
to keep doing this
while doing that.

13:20.866 --> 13:21.866
Oh, this is terrific.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.368
This is really great.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.370
Polly and her family
are going to come in here,

13:25.371 --> 13:27.372
take one look at that,
and go right back out again.

13:27.373 --> 13:29.374
Danny, please relax,
for crying out loud.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.376
I mean, just because
one guy in the house

13:31.377 --> 13:32.877
is doing something
a little different

13:32.878 --> 13:35.380
doesn't mean
the entire family is crazy.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.385
Gin! Ha, ha!

13:40.386 --> 13:42.887
That's that. Everything is done.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.389
Done? What did you make?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.890
A roast. Calm down.

13:45.891 --> 13:46.891
A roast? A roast?

13:46.892 --> 13:47.892
Yes, a roast?

13:47.893 --> 13:49.894
A roast what?
What did you roast?

13:49.895 --> 13:51.396
A yak.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.397
A yak?

13:52.398 --> 13:55.901
I don't think Polly's parents
are into health foods.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.907
Hey.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.909
Hey, guys.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.411
How you doing?

14:06.412 --> 14:07.912
Forget it.
We're not leaving.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.915
Who said anything about leaving?

14:10.916 --> 14:11.916
We're not moving.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.418
Come on, you guys.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.919
Give me a break, will you?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.421
My girlfriend
and her entire family

14:16.422 --> 14:17.922
are going to be here any minute.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.924
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.427
Gin! Ha, ha!

14:23.929 --> 14:25.430
Hey, listen, what's for dinner?

14:25.431 --> 14:27.933
Is it grits, cornpone
ribs, collard greens?

14:30.436 --> 14:32.437
If you so much
as look cross-eyed

14:32.438 --> 14:33.938
at any one of her family,

14:33.939 --> 14:35.940
I'm going to turn you
into a pepper mill.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.942
You got it?

14:37.943 --> 14:39.444
Got it.

14:40.946 --> 14:41.946
All right, they're here!

14:41.947 --> 14:42.947
Come on!

14:42.948 --> 14:45.450
Okay.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.451
Hi.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.452
Hi.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.454
Come on in.

14:49.455 --> 14:50.455
Hi.

14:50.456 --> 14:51.456
Hello.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.958
Welcome.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.964
Ma, this is Polly.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.966
Hi. Pleased to meet you.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.468
Hello.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.969
And, uh, this is
her mother, Rose,

15:04.970 --> 15:06.971
and this is her father, Walter,

15:06.972 --> 15:09.974
and, uh, that's
her brother, Eddie.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.476
This is my mother, Mary.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.977
I'm very pleased to meet you.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.479
Pleased to meet you too, Mary.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.980
How do you do?

15:15.981 --> 15:16.981
How do you do?

15:19.485 --> 15:22.987
Uh, Danny, take their coats.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.989
Oh, yeah.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.491
Oh, hi. Hi, everybody.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.992
Welcome to the house.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.494
It's really nice
to have you here.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.996
Make yourselves at home.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.000
I'm Burt.

15:36.502 --> 15:37.502
So come on.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.004
Tell me all about yourselves.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.507
Oh, the balloon?

15:42.508 --> 15:44.509
Uh, see, uh, Burt is trying

15:44.510 --> 15:46.511
to get into the <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records.</i>

15:46.512 --> 15:49.013
Well, I figured it was
something important.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.516
So, uh, what do you do?

15:51.517 --> 15:52.517
I'm a musician.

15:52.518 --> 15:53.518
No kidding.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.520
What is it?
Bebop, scat, what?

15:55.521 --> 15:56.521
I'm an oboist

15:56.522 --> 15:58.022
for the New York
Philharmonic Orchestra.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.023
Hey, no kidding.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.024
Really?
That's incredible.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.026
I mean, Danny here
plays the harmonica.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.528
Hey, Mare!

16:03.529 --> 16:05.029
Would you like an hors d'oeuvre?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.531
Yes.

16:06.532 --> 16:07.532
Excuse us, darling.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.534
Hi, everybody.
I'm Chuck.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.035
And I'm Bob.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.036
Swell.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.037
This one plays with balloons,

16:13.038 --> 16:16.541
and the Beach Boy has a doll.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.043
Well, come on in.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.051
So...

16:29.054 --> 16:31.556
So...

16:31.557 --> 16:32.557
So, Danny here tells me

16:32.558 --> 16:34.058
that you're a family of Negroes.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.560
Is that true?

16:35.561 --> 16:36.642
Bob, come on.
Man, wait a...

16:45.070 --> 16:46.070
I'm, uh...

16:46.071 --> 16:47.572
I'm really sorry about that.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.074
Somehow,
I'm not really insulted.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.576
You're a good sport.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.077
No, I'm a lousy sport.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.079
It's just that I can't get
very upset

16:55.080 --> 16:57.081
at a person who vents
his pent-up hostility

16:57.082 --> 16:59.084
through a piece of wood.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.086
What do you mean?

17:02.087 --> 17:03.588
What do I mean?

17:03.589 --> 17:05.589
Hi. Getting acquainted?

17:05.590 --> 17:07.593
In a manner of speaking.

17:09.973 --> 17:11.095
It's going very, very badly.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.597
Big surprise.

17:14.098 --> 17:17.602
Are we trying to quit smoking?

17:17.603 --> 17:18.603
Uh, no.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.605
No, we, uh...
We have a little baby girl.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.106
Oh, really?

17:22.107 --> 17:23.107
Yeah, it's my son.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.108
My other son.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.609
It's a half-son.

17:25.611 --> 17:26.611
My other half-son.

17:26.612 --> 17:28.112
I have two halves and one whole.

17:28.113 --> 17:31.115
My brother, he's a father.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.117
Yeah, right.
His brother, my son.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.619
His daughter
is my granddaughter.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.622
Yeah, yeah, see,
my brother is my niece's father.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.624
Yeah, listen, what it means
is that his brother is...

17:39.625 --> 17:41.125
I got it. I got it.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.627
They're a lovely couple,
aren't they?

17:42.628 --> 17:44.128
Oh, yes, they are.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.630
It's sweet.

17:45.631 --> 17:46.631
Very.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.133
They're out of their minds.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.635
Totally.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.637
Let's get a drink.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.138
Make it doubles?

17:54.139 --> 17:56.141
You got it.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.644
So, Eddie, uh, what do you do?

17:59.645 --> 18:00.645
I'm a writer.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.146
I didn't know that.

18:02.147 --> 18:05.650
Well, we've never really
had a chance to chit-chat.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.652
What do you write?

18:07.653 --> 18:09.654
Essays, magazine articles.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.656
The plight of the black race.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.658
400 years of oppression.

18:13.659 --> 18:16.160
The white man's disgrace.

18:16.161 --> 18:18.663
Oh, so you're a gag writer,
is that it?

18:24.670 --> 18:25.670
Dinner's ready.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.172
Come and get it.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.674
Uh, listen,
next time you come over,

18:29.675 --> 18:31.175
you ought to bring your horn.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.176
My what?

18:32.177 --> 18:33.177
Your oboe.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.179
I never heard an oboe.
Can you imagine that?

18:35.180 --> 18:36.681
Yes, I can.

18:37.643 --> 18:38.683
Oh, that was really tense.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.184
Tense? Ha.
That was ridiculous.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.185
Well...

18:41.186 --> 18:42.687
I think the worst part is over.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.188
Oh, you think so?

18:44.189 --> 18:46.191
No.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.196
Well, that was easy.

18:52.197 --> 18:53.698
It gets easier with practice.

18:53.699 --> 18:54.699
Really?

18:54.700 --> 18:56.200
Mm-hmm.

18:57.202 --> 18:58.703
ROSE: Eddie!

18:58.704 --> 19:01.706
EDDIE: Hey, I didn't
do it on purpose.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.717
Oh, hi, Daddy.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.718
You know,

19:13.719 --> 19:15.219
I'll never be able to understand

19:15.220 --> 19:18.223
why it is
you think I'm your father.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.227
Oh, Daddy.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.229
Look, Daddy. Paris.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.230
Isn't it beautiful?

19:26.231 --> 19:29.233
I'm thinking of taking a trip
with Chester.

19:29.234 --> 19:32.236
Either there or Italy.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.238
What do you think?
You've been to both.

19:34.239 --> 19:36.240
Either place is fine.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.243
Just stay away from Guadalcanal.

19:40.746 --> 19:41.746
Jess...

19:41.747 --> 19:42.747
Hi, Chester. Look.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.248
Jess, listen.

19:44.249 --> 19:45.249
Paris.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.250
That's very nice.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.752
Jess, I have to talk to you.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.254
A trip to Paris, Chester,
just you and me.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.256
Jess, I don't want to go away.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.257
Oh, come now, colonel.

19:53.258 --> 19:56.761
Paris might be occupied,
but it's still beautiful.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.263
Major, would you please go?

19:59.264 --> 20:02.266
Not me. I hate the French.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.268
Daddy, would you do me favor?

20:04.269 --> 20:06.270
Would you see if you could find
some pictures of Italy

20:06.271 --> 20:07.772
for me to look at?

20:07.773 --> 20:09.273
Oh, fine. You'll love Italy.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.776
You can look up
my friend, Sergio.

20:11.777 --> 20:14.780
He'll get you
all the women you need.

20:16.782 --> 20:17.782
Jess...

20:17.783 --> 20:20.284
Now, Chester,
don't you interrupt me.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.786
You have been wonderful.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.788
You have been working so hard,

20:23.789 --> 20:25.289
going to the minister's
counseling sessions

20:25.290 --> 20:27.792
morning, noon and night.

20:29.294 --> 20:33.297
So, I have decided
on a special reward:

20:33.298 --> 20:34.799
a trip to Europe.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.306
My dear...

20:42.307 --> 20:44.809
Chester, don't cry, dear.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.310
We don't have to go to Europe.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.812
We could go to the Caribbean.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.814
No, no, no, no, no.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.315
Oh, Jess...

20:51.316 --> 20:53.818
I can't stand it.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.820
Oh, well, then
we don't have to go.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.321
There, there, darling.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.824
I had no idea
traveling upset you so.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.826
Oh, Jessie...

21:01.827 --> 21:03.327
Jess, I am so crazy.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.329
I am so crazy.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.330
Oh, no,

21:06.331 --> 21:07.832
you're not, Chester.

21:07.833 --> 21:11.335
Traveling is not
what it used to be.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.837
What I've done...

21:12.838 --> 21:13.838
What I've done...

21:13.839 --> 21:15.840
I've screwed up my life.

21:15.841 --> 21:16.841
Oh, no.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.342
Now, darling,

21:18.343 --> 21:19.844
that is all in your past.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.846
No, it's not.
It's not.

21:21.847 --> 21:22.847
I'm so...

21:22.848 --> 21:26.851
Oh, this must be
a part of your therapy.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.853
Oh, I can't stand it.

21:28.854 --> 21:31.856
I am so crazy
to be in love with her.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.357
I guess this is

21:33.358 --> 21:35.359
what they call
a "breakthrough."

21:35.360 --> 21:38.362
I can't stand
being in love with her,

21:38.363 --> 21:41.365
and yet I am mad about her.

21:41.366 --> 21:42.867
I know. I know.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.370
There, there.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.878
I beg your pardon?

21:53.879 --> 21:55.880
I'm so confused.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.882
I know it's crazy to love her,

21:57.883 --> 22:00.384
but I'll die if I lose her.

22:00.385 --> 22:01.385
Who?

22:01.386 --> 22:02.887
Gloria.

22:02.888 --> 22:03.888
Gloria?

22:03.889 --> 22:05.389
Yeah, the minister's daughter.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.892
You and the minister's daughter?

22:20.906 --> 22:22.406
You know, it's funny. I...

22:22.407 --> 22:26.911
I feel more stupid
than anything else.

22:26.912 --> 22:30.915
I feel so incredibly stupid

22:30.916 --> 22:33.918
to have thought for one minute
you could ever change.

22:33.919 --> 22:36.921
Jess, this hurts me
as much as it hurts you.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.923
It hurts you?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.926
It hurts you?

22:41.927 --> 22:44.428
Nothing could hurt you,
Chester Tate.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.930
You have no soul.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.434
But I will tell you one thing,
and you listen to me carefully.

22:50.435 --> 22:51.936
I will never, ever,

22:51.937 --> 22:53.938
under any circumstances
whatsoever,

22:53.939 --> 22:55.940
take you back again.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.943
This is
the very last time, Chester.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.446
It is final
and it is irreparable.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.956
Now, you get out of this house.

23:11.957 --> 23:14.459
I've got a life
I'm going to live.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.482
ANNOUNCER: <i>Will Burt get into
the</i> World Book of Records?

23:38.483 --> 23:39.984
<i>Will he live to read it?</i>

23:39.985 --> 23:41.485
<i>What will happen with Chester</i>

23:41.486 --> 23:43.487

23:43.488 --> 23:45.990

23:45.991 --> 23:47.491
<i>Will she be alone for long?</i>
