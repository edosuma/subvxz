WEBVTT

00:12.680 --> 00:14.140
Coming!

00:14.223 --> 00:15.725
God.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.518
Noise makers.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.980
They make wonderful
nest mates, no?

00:22.064 --> 00:24.567
Sven wets the bed and
Lars grinds his beak.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.861
Not really the hard cocks
I want to wake up to.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.405
Sven and Lars are hens.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.700
Hey, Ulrika, thanks for letting
me sleep here.

00:32.783 --> 00:36.495
Billie's going to let me back
in the cottage soon, probably.

00:36.579 --> 00:38.998
You are welcome to stay until
the next full moon.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.542
- Then I tend to get primordial.
- You mean primal?

00:41.625 --> 00:43.669
No, when I take peyote,
I regress fully.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.379
Oh dear.

00:47.465 --> 00:50.009
If you are going to stay,
you may earn your keep.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.886
I need someone to put up
the decorations

00:51.969 --> 00:53.471
at the talent show tonight.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.473
You're asking me to decorate
because I'm gay?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.516
I'm asking you because your
family hates you.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.059
So you've got free time.

00:59.477 --> 01:00.853
Ow.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.105
You should take
peyote with me.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.442
It might help with your
intense self-hatred.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.527
Heard it makes
you shit yourself.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.613
Well, I have extra buckets.

01:12.782 --> 01:15.576
- I'm gonna go home now.
- Okay.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.058
Sweet Bobby Burke.

01:39.141 --> 01:42.645
It was a little bleak,
so we zhuzhed it up.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.940
You guys didn't ask me to help?
I love decorating.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.316
Gay, hello.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.026
Ow! What the--

01:50.069 --> 01:51.821
What is this...

01:51.904 --> 01:54.198
gorgeous safety hazard
doing here?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.242
We found it on
a hike yesterday.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.370
Come on, we're late
for Riley's.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.788
Oh, you guys are going
to Riley's?

02:00.871 --> 02:02.414
Mm-hm. He's showing us

02:02.498 --> 02:04.250
his next roadkill
investigation series.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.252
He's doing Miami this year.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.254
Oh man, that's the best one.

02:09.547 --> 02:11.048
Just digging the shiv right in.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.550
Can't Justin come?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.844
Ugh, Riley and
Justin have herstory.

02:14.927 --> 02:18.055
The "I Never Want to See You
Again kind."

02:18.848 --> 02:20.474
Do you know what? It's fine.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.268
I think it's going to be fine.
I'll come.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.270
I'll just get changed.
The arts are under-funded.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.688
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.189
Oh, it's invite-only.

02:29.108 --> 02:33.529
Okay. Yeah, I mean, I...
I got you, sis.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.283
Nope, sorry. "Paris Is
Burning," we steal everything.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.076
God...

02:39.159 --> 02:40.369
Billie...

02:41.537 --> 02:44.164
Just-- just give her more time.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.916
Birth mama's got this, okay?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.710
When are we going to get
to hang out?

02:47.793 --> 02:50.296
Soon. Soon.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.007
Okay. Because you were my
best friend first.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.889
I drank those.

03:01.891 --> 03:03.434
- Me.
- Are we really going

03:03.517 --> 03:04.894
to a roadkill exhibit?

03:04.977 --> 03:07.021
I was just messing with Justin.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.690
How long are you going to keep
him in the doghouse?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.734
Well, he left me to rot

03:11.817 --> 03:14.320
with a knockoff Gwyneth,
reeking of Herpes fish.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.906
- So forever then.
- Mm-hm.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.283
But it wouldn't hurt
to just take

03:19.366 --> 03:20.993
the higher plane on this, love.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.786
Look, I know forgiveness
isn't cheap, but--

03:22.870 --> 03:24.622
Yeah, and Justin's
hella bankrupt.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.876
Then I'll stay for as long
as forever takes.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.591
Ah...

03:35.674 --> 03:37.676
Forgot how beautiful
this place was.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.220
Yeah.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.348
So will I get to meet

03:42.431 --> 03:44.183
the boy you've been drooling
over all summer?

03:44.266 --> 03:46.226
Yeah, maybe from 50 feet,

03:48.020 --> 03:50.022
Maisy says we can't
hang anymore.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.524
She thinks I bring out the
environmental terrorist

03:52.608 --> 03:54.985
- in Killian.
- You can choose your crush,

03:56.070 --> 03:58.113
but you can't choose
your crush's parents.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.157
Come on.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.464
Why does the light always look
so good on them?

04:16.715 --> 04:18.050
God damn.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.719
Oh, oh.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.805
Hey, guys.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.890
- Billie's out.
<i>- Oh, Justin,</i>

04:24.974 --> 04:27.017
<i>if she forgot our call,</i>
<i>that means Teesa arrived.</i>

04:27.101 --> 04:28.978
You guys knew Teesa
was coming?

04:29.061 --> 04:30.312
<i>Well, she finished recording</i>
<i>her album</i>

04:30.396 --> 04:31.897
<i>and wanted to see Billie,</i>

04:31.981 --> 04:33.440
<i>so we told her she</i>
<i>was with you.</i>

04:33.524 --> 04:34.733
<i>I mean, we texted, but,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

04:34.817 --> 04:36.110
<i>cell service in Cyprus...</i>

04:36.193 --> 04:37.403
<i>- How's Teesa?</i>

04:37.486 --> 04:39.738
Oh, I mean... great.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.324
You know, so great.
They're doing so great.

04:42.408 --> 04:45.869
They're having a blast
together, decorating, hiking,

04:45.953 --> 04:47.871
just taking in
the local art scene.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.665
<i>So, we're working through some</i>
<i>feelings of jealousy.</i>

04:49.748 --> 04:51.583
She was my best friend first.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.377
<i>We felt the same when Teesa</i>
<i>took Billie</i>

04:53.460 --> 04:55.295
<i>- to see Beyoncé at Coachella.</i>
<i>- Oh, and Paris.</i>

04:55.379 --> 04:58.632
<i>- Ugh!</i>
- Man, just like...

04:58.716 --> 05:00.384
it just looks
so easy for them.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.511
<i>Well, it is, you know,</i>

05:02.594 --> 05:04.138
<i>Billie has been raised by two</i>
<i>emotionally healthy adults,</i>

05:04.221 --> 05:06.181
<i>and Teesa is incredibly</i>
<i>intuitive.</i>

05:06.265 --> 05:08.392
<i>But you were emotionally</i>
<i>abandoned as a child,</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:10.936
<i>so you leverage humour to mask</i>
<i>a deep sense of unworthiness.</i>

05:11.020 --> 05:12.855
I'm not feeling a whole
lot better here.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.606
<i>Well, that could take years of</i>
<i>cognitive therapy.</i>

05:14.690 --> 05:15.941
<i>Decades, even.</i>

05:16.025 --> 05:17.609
- <i>At least. </i>
- Oh.

05:18.027 --> 05:20.154
Okay, well, should we maybe
book another session?

05:22.114 --> 05:23.657
Guys?

05:23.741 --> 05:26.243
Oh, shit, I think
you're frozen.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.704
I can see you moving.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.792
So if someone's
like hardcore drowning,

05:33.876 --> 05:35.169
what do we do?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.879
You <i>save</i> them.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.214
Like all of us, or just
the person that saw them?

05:39.798 --> 05:41.633
Wait, what about sharks?

05:41.717 --> 05:43.469
I don't know.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.222
I'm not going in there!

05:47.306 --> 05:48.557
Well, you're
the fastest swimmer.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.434
Well, you're the oldest.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.186
- Is that your guy?
- Mm-hm.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.063
He's cute!

05:54.563 --> 05:56.565
In a narcoleptic kind
of way.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.275
Ew, what?

05:59.651 --> 06:02.237
Lord love a duck! Teesa!

06:02.571 --> 06:04.990
- You're back!
- Teesa!

06:05.074 --> 06:06.700
First Justin,
then Billie.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.578
The whole not-really-a-family's
back together.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.747
Hey, are you going
to sing in the talent show?

06:11.830 --> 06:13.791
Because I could do backup
vocals for you and Justin,

06:13.874 --> 06:15.000
like last time.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.752
It was back up maracas.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.796
Right? Yes, yes, yes.
And I still got 'em, babe.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.839
- So I-- Teesa, I mean.
- Yeah.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.758
Anyway, oh, I got rhythm.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.384
My vocal range has improved.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.386
I'm pretty sure
I'm a velvet mahogany now.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.639
So I mean, if you need any help
with those backing vocals--

06:28.722 --> 06:30.766
Actually, Billie and I will
be performing together.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.017
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.644
- We will?
- Uh huh.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.270
Oh, we would
love to perform with our kids.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.897
We have four perfect girls now,

06:36.980 --> 06:40.109
but Waynikins and I host
the show every year.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.194
I hope there are spots left.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.946
The sign-up sheet
went up like weeks ago.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.365
- We'll get you in.
- We better grab the last ones.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.825
- Yes!
- See you at the show.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.618
- Yeah. Wow.
- Okay, bye.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.745
Are we really singing?
Because the show's tonight

06:51.829 --> 06:53.455
and that's like not enough
time to rehearse.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.915
You don't need to.
Trust me, honey.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.750
Once you open your mouth
on stage,

06:56.834 --> 06:59.670
it'll be the last thing anyone
remembers, even Wayne.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.213
- Come on.
- Babe, I love you.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.469
Babe, babe! I'm out.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.721
- I can't take it anymore.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.223
You got to get back on the ice.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.142
The deal was we trade
off talent shows

07:13.225 --> 07:15.644
so we don't murder Opal.
You can do this.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.021
You dummied Terry
"The Mountain" McGuinness.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.815
Yeah, yeah--
yeah, I can do this.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.276
Daddy, where's my
coconut water?

07:22.359 --> 07:24.820
No, I've been broken
by a ten year old.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.196
I'll make it up to you.
Promise.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.408
Nothing to worry about.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.368
Yeah, no.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.911
- Billie!
- Mm-mm.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.079
Teesa.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.747
What a nice surprise.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.667
Nice to see you too, Mimsie.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.128
Oh, it's Maisy.
Mimsie's my mother.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.297
Oh, Mimsie, Maisy,
whoopsie daisy.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.840
Yeah, they kind of sound
the same.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.592
Yeah.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.302
Oh, you're performing
in the talent show?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.429
Yeah. With Billie.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.764
She has so much more spare time
now that she can't see Killian.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.767
Yeah, I know, that was really
hard on everyone.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.811
But you know what?
Sometimes setting boundaries

07:57.895 --> 08:00.522
really helps them
make better choices.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.274
Every parent
has their own style.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.444
My little Opal
is performing, too.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.529
He's doing a really
cute dance number.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.781
He's so independent,
practically emancipated.

08:09.865 --> 08:13.202
Well, it was so nice to see you
M-- Maisy.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.583
- I'm losing fluids.
- Oh.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.168
Who was that?

08:21.251 --> 08:23.712
That is Teesa.
That's Billie's birth mom.

08:23.795 --> 08:28.217
She's going to be performing in
the talent show with Billie.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.344
I know you were hoping to sweep
this year, sweetie, but--

08:30.427 --> 08:32.054
Save your sympathy
for my runner-up.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.972
Billie's no match
for "Mulan Rouge."

08:37.059 --> 08:38.268
That's my boy.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.821
Hey! Hi!

08:51.573 --> 08:52.866
Went all the way over
to Riley's

08:52.950 --> 08:54.368
but there wasn't anybody there.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.203
Yeah, because we came
here instead.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.497
Okay, so I just paddled across
the lake for nothing.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.123
That's cool.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.917
Guess who signed us up
for the talent show?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.254
Are you serious? The three
of us singing together.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.546
We're going to be like
the Supremes,

09:06.630 --> 09:08.590
TLC, Destiny's Child--

09:08.674 --> 09:10.801
Nope, totally sorry, "Paris Is
Burning," we steal everything.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.886
Actually, just Teesa and I are
going to be singing.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.305
We're gonna grab her
guitar and rehearse.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.059
Okay, yeah, maybe I can
hang out backstage.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.477
Watch you guys rehearse,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.354
be your own personal
stan club.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.731
Aren't you helping Ulrika
with decorations?

09:24.815 --> 09:26.733
Don't want to stand
her up, too.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.027
I know you're trying to
set a good example.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.114
More time.

09:32.197 --> 09:36.159
I set a good example. I do.
I-- I...

09:36.243 --> 09:37.786
I taught her to paddle.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.541
I did that. Me.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.503
"Lady Marmalade]

09:46.586 --> 09:49.423
And one, two three, four five,
six, seven, turn.

09:49.506 --> 09:53.302
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

09:53.385 --> 09:57.306
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, kick.

09:57.389 --> 10:01.435
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

10:01.518 --> 10:05.856
Slide, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, fan!

10:05.939 --> 10:09.818
- Nice, great job, honey.
- Great?

10:10.736 --> 10:14.489
I gave you sultry 19th century
Paris-Sui-dynasty realness.

10:14.573 --> 10:17.159
I just have one tiny
suggestion.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.077
Oh, I don't tuck
for rehearsals.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.204
I think we should workshop
the choreo a little bit.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.749
You know, bring out the Disney.
A little more Mulan,

10:23.832 --> 10:25.625
a little less Rouge.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.502
Why are you tone policing
my art?

10:28.754 --> 10:33.675
Because it's a little spicy
for a fifth grader.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.345
You know, most 19th century sex
workers were dead by 20.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.097
- So I'm already middle aged.
- Honey...

10:39.181 --> 10:42.059
the talent show is really just
card tricks and dumb skits.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.394
It's not erotic can-cans
from fifth graders.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.937
Actually, drag's
all ages now.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.231
Thanks to RuPaul,
subverting gender roles

10:48.315 --> 10:50.400
is wholesome family fun.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.362
- Finally, someone who gets it.
- Why, thank you.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.113
Do you want to maybe
do that somewhere else?

10:55.197 --> 10:56.406
We're rehearsing.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.033
No, I think Justin should stay

10:58.116 --> 10:59.826
to get the community's
perspective.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.661
Ooh...

11:01.745 --> 11:04.831
There is no bigger
ally than your mother.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.917
Who watched "It's A Sin"
with you? Twice.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.923
Um, I'm sorry, L-Gay-BTQIA+...

11:14.341 --> 11:15.509
I live to dance.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.260
- He stays.
- To slay.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.678
Yay.

11:19.221 --> 11:21.306
Now, shall we take
it from the top?

11:21.390 --> 11:23.016
Yes, all right,
where do you need me?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.976
- Sit there and be quiet.
- Okay.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.236
Okay? Your turn.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.405
No way am I following that.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.156
Don't get in your head
about this.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.117
We sang this all the way to
Coachella and back.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.077
That was just us!
This is in front of

11:42.160 --> 11:44.371
- an audience. Like tonight.
- That's why we're rehearsing.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.665
Come on. The stage is ours
for another half hour.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.708
That's not enough time.
And if I push too hard,

11:48.792 --> 11:50.627
I could get vocal nodes
or lose my voice.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.796
Do you really want to silence
me at a time when we,

11:52.879 --> 11:54.297
as Black women should be
supporting each other?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.425
Baby!
You're going to be fine. Okay?

11:56.508 --> 11:58.385
You got your tummy
mummy's singing genes.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.887
Which means I've also got
Justin's screw-up genes.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.098
Okay, why don't we see
if there's space

12:03.181 --> 12:04.433
in the boathouse to rehearse?

12:04.516 --> 12:05.684
It'll be more private there--

12:05.767 --> 12:07.269
Nuh-uh! Justin's in there.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.854
Sorry, but you are insane

12:08.937 --> 12:10.397
if you think I'm performing
when my DNA

12:10.480 --> 12:12.149
is 50% hysterical Muppet!

12:12.858 --> 12:14.609
Like, I'm happy to be alive
and all.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.862
But seriously, how drunk were
you to sleep with Justin?

12:16.945 --> 12:18.613
All right, sulky Sally.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.323
That track's been skipping
long enough. Let's go.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.536
- Go.
- We got a few minutes

12:24.619 --> 12:26.204
while Opal's
laminating his brows,

12:26.288 --> 12:28.623
so I was thinking that it
should be maybe something

12:28.707 --> 12:32.919
a little bit like smile, turn,
chassé, lick the fan.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.298
Yeah, no. I was thinking
more of like

12:36.381 --> 12:38.675
a tidy pirouette instead of
all the pelvic grinding.

12:38.758 --> 12:43.597
Mm-hm, mm-hm. Yeah. Just
lacks a whole lot of drama.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.515
And instead of licking the fan,

12:45.599 --> 12:48.018
we could do a cute little
shimmy, kick ball-change

12:48.101 --> 12:49.644
and a Motown, Motown.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.396
I mean, I'm just marking it.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.689
No, you're just pandering.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.400
I am mothering, excuse me.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.943
There's a time and a place

12:57.027 --> 12:58.487
for dick dominance
through dance,

12:58.570 --> 13:00.238
and ten years old is not it.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.616
Oh, my God, this is just
like that time

13:02.699 --> 13:04.201
that you stopped my dad

13:04.284 --> 13:06.411
from seeing my Spice Girls
tribute concert.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.497
You stole my swimsuit and
covered it in glitter.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.248
Because I was Ginger!

13:10.332 --> 13:12.250
Dad wasn't ready for a
three hour lip sync,

13:12.334 --> 13:14.169
and the lake is not ready
for Mulan Rouge.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.379
A mash-up between
a cross-dressing

13:16.463 --> 13:19.174
Chinese warrior and a dying
Parisian hooker is genius.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.800
Sex worker, excuse me,

13:20.884 --> 13:22.344
and consumption is a horrible
way to die.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.179
You basically drown
in your own blood.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.889
I don't know what part

13:25.972 --> 13:27.974
of fuck-up-Maisy's-reno-plan
this is,

13:28.058 --> 13:30.060
but my baby is talking
pyrotechnics.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.229
I need to manage
his expectations.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.356
Or you could try believing
in his vision.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.399
If Opal showgirls down the
stairs, Maisy,

13:36.483 --> 13:38.693
whatever, at least he goes down
dancing to his own beat.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.612
Just because you gave up
your kid doesn't mean

13:40.695 --> 13:42.155
I have to give
up on mine.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.282
Enough!

13:44.366 --> 13:47.202
Sorry, Mom, but this
isn't working out.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.912
Justin and I can take
it from here.

13:50.789 --> 13:55.168
Oh, you can't fire
your own mother.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.629
Yes, I can.
You're straightwashing my art.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.257
Don't you come for me,
Harvey Milk.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.467
I gestated you for
10 months, okay?

14:02.551 --> 14:04.094
I'm the only one in this room

14:04.177 --> 14:05.762
whose pussy's actually
been on fire.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.013
Ew.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.478
Good luck when he asks
for a snow leopard.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.731
Snow leopard. Lame.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.484
I was actually thinking
like a dragon python.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.152
How about like
a trapeze entrance?

14:21.236 --> 14:23.321
Like, whoosh from the air.
"There he is."

14:23.405 --> 14:25.949
Dramatic. Jumps down.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.410
I don't think our stage has
that kind of load capacity.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.622
What is it with people
trespassing on this lake?

14:33.415 --> 14:36.251
This is your family cottage,
remember?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.634
- Now dig.
- Come again?

14:44.718 --> 14:47.804
Dig. Here. Come on!

14:54.227 --> 14:56.354
We buried this after
you were born.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.819
Justin found the
adoption agency

15:02.902 --> 15:05.405
and we picked your
parents together.

15:08.283 --> 15:11.703
He always supported my choice
to give you a better life,

15:12.621 --> 15:14.706
even if neither of
our parents did.

15:19.002 --> 15:22.047
Justin's dad sent me that
letter before you were born.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.509
Justin threw it away,
but I saved it.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.264
Derrick threatened to take me
to court to keep you.

15:31.348 --> 15:35.268
Said I'd ruined Justin's life
and yours if I gave you up.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.520
What a dick.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.315
You can choose your crush,

15:41.316 --> 15:43.568
but you can't choose
your crush's parents.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.907
Justin never forgave his
dad for that letter.

15:51.785 --> 15:55.372
I never thought I would,
either, but with time...

15:57.957 --> 16:02.128
I realized Derrick was scared
of losing his son,

16:03.046 --> 16:07.008
his granddaughter, his hair.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.637
Yeah, sounds like a lot of
people wanted to keep me.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.099
- We all loved you very--
- Except you.

16:15.684 --> 16:21.064
Hey, I gave you away,
but I never gave up on you.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.608
Neither did Justin.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.111
Yeah, but you've always
been here for me.

16:26.778 --> 16:30.073
Justin just ran away.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.784
Hey, I checked out plenty
of times too.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.453
We were kids, Billie,

16:35.537 --> 16:37.288
just trying to figure out how
to ride sidecar

16:37.372 --> 16:39.541
to our baby's parents
without getting in the way.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.794
You and me have
had years to figure out

16:42.877 --> 16:44.504
who we are to each other.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.383
Justin's putting in overtime

16:48.466 --> 16:50.677
just to make up
for the time he missed.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.971
Yeah, by making a mess
of everything.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.056
He gets better with practice.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.517
He abandoned me
for a threesome.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.144
Didn't he get herpes?

16:59.227 --> 17:02.313
No, I tried to give
the lake herpes.

17:04.274 --> 17:07.068
So maybe you need a little
practice too.

17:07.819 --> 17:08.903
Hm?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.668
Thanks for saving our seat.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.420
Those are for your
brother, right?

17:25.503 --> 17:27.088
Absolutely.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.132
Tell him you chose them.
He hates lilies.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.592
You need to calm down, sweetie.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.218
I can't.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.304
If Opal loses,
it's Maria Callas on repeat

17:34.387 --> 17:35.555
for the rest of the summer.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.558
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.143
Oh, sure.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.353
Hi, I'm Teesa.
I'm Billie's birth mom.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.813
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.483
Good choice.
Billie loves lilies.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.485
Traitor.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.070
Why are you stopping Billie

17:51.154 --> 17:52.405
and Killian from seeing
each other?

17:52.489 --> 17:54.657
Because they're step cousins.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.409
There's nothing weird about--

17:56.493 --> 17:58.620
Okay, maybe
it's a little weird,

17:58.703 --> 18:01.164
but you know what it's like to
be an outsider on the lake.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.166
What's it going to take just
to let them hang out?

18:03.249 --> 18:04.709
Don't sing tonight.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.628
And I will drop the
restraining order.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.214
It's not fair to have
a ringer in the game.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.885
Fine, you can take me out,

18:13.968 --> 18:17.096
but if our kids need us to win,
we're not doing our jobs.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.230
I just made it so
Opal can't lose.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.440
Justin said I was
a terrible ally.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.653
Mom worries that you'll
kill me in my sleep.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.530
But you're the only
woman for me.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.824
But leave out the ally part,

18:35.907 --> 18:37.659
or Opal will blast you
for virtue signalling.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.079
Virtue signaling...

18:43.122 --> 18:45.083
- Oh, my God.
- Here.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.293
Ah. Why is my makeup running?

18:47.377 --> 18:48.962
- Did you bake your face?
- What?

18:49.045 --> 18:50.839
Got it!
Bake your face?

18:50.922 --> 18:52.841
It means, set your foundation
with powder.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.009
Watch a tutorial, please.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.512
- I'm good.
- Okay.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.809
Oh!

19:02.892 --> 19:05.353
well, look what
the dead cat dragged in.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.397
It's a taxidermy joke
and a bad one.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.982
Are there good ones?

19:10.024 --> 19:11.401
Cool shirt.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.653
Okay, sure.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.113
Thank you.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.574
Is that the herstory?

19:17.657 --> 19:18.783
Fuck yeah.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.410
- Damn.
- God, I know.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.872
You know my girl is going
to kill yours, right.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.707
Not with this train.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.460
- A train?
- Choo motherfucking choo.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.315
- Hey, everyone, this is Wayne.
- This is Jayne.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.983
And welcome
to the Boat House's

19:52.066 --> 19:54.235
47th edition of...

19:55.904 --> 19:57.614
The Lake's Got Talent!

20:01.701 --> 20:02.994
First up, we have

20:03.077 --> 20:05.371
our very own Swedish meatball.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.290
She's ready to Ragnarok you

20:07.373 --> 20:09.375
with her scandi
comedy stylings.

20:09.459 --> 20:12.003
- Please welcome IKEA--
- Ulrika.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.796
Ulrika. Ulrika. Ah!

20:13.880 --> 20:16.215
- Come on.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.675
Ha-ha.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.847
Hello.

20:23.932 --> 20:28.019
They say that insects are
the food of the future.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.731
Now that's what
I call good grub.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.403
Who likes Abba?

20:41.699 --> 20:42.825
Hey, everybody.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.633
This is Rile-E-Coyote.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.469
Oh hey, Riley.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.973
Can you believe my boyfriend
told me I had a flat ass?

21:07.976 --> 21:09.268
Ouch.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.145
You're telling me,

21:11.229 --> 21:12.814
doing squats ain't going to fix

21:12.897 --> 21:14.607
getting railed
by an 18 wheeler.

21:17.777 --> 21:22.073
For my next trick, I will
make my sister disappear.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.207
Abra-cadabs!

21:33.960 --> 21:35.461
I'm right here, Keri.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.598
Keri's fine. Nothin mama's
Ativan couldn't fix--

21:47.682 --> 21:48.766
Sorry, baby.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.393
All right, everyone,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.520
the moment we have all
been waiting for.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.272
So put your hands together
and welcome

21:54.355 --> 21:57.567
- the incredible Teesa.
- And Billie.

21:58.026 --> 22:01.446
Sure, and I'm going to
assist on maracas.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.697
No, you're not.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.866
Okay. It's all you, baby.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.117
- Go.
- What?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.368
Good luck, Teesa.

22:27.722 --> 22:33.478
cover]

24:46.319 --> 24:47.528
Nice job!

24:52.742 --> 24:56.454
Whoa, whoa, what?
Dua, who? Miley, where?

24:56.537 --> 24:58.122
- That was unbelievable--
- No.

24:58.206 --> 25:01.626
No, definitely more time,
I understand. No problem.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.544
Stop it.

25:06.547 --> 25:07.590
- Hi.
- Go.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.050
Maisy and I worked it out.

25:09.425 --> 25:10.635
Mm-hm.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.014
You were amazing.

25:17.975 --> 25:20.853
Thank you, they're beautiful.

25:20.937 --> 25:23.689
I know you weren't pumped about
coming to the lake, but...

25:25.107 --> 25:27.568
Bella wasn't pumped
about going to Forks, either.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.111
Bella?

25:29.403 --> 25:30.529
Like in Twilight?

25:30.613 --> 25:32.657
Yeah. She found true love.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.284
Yeah, by becoming a vampire
child bride.

25:35.952 --> 25:38.287
Well, I only read the first...

25:39.914 --> 25:41.290
four.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.792
- I read all of them.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.043
All right?

25:46.045 --> 25:47.505
Have you guys seen Opal?

25:47.588 --> 25:49.340
He's up next, but we
can't find him.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.425
- Maybe he got scared.
- No, Opal does not get scared.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.010
He's been rehearsing
for like two weeks.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.595
Olive won't hold the
curtain for much longer.

25:54.679 --> 25:56.347
It's okay. I think
I know where he is.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.015
Where?

25:58.099 --> 25:59.767
Probably living his best
Liza in the boat house.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.477
- Let's go.
- Opal needs more

26:01.560 --> 26:03.688
than just an ally.
He needs his community.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.189
Okay? Fix this.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.858
Don't jazz hands at me.

26:07.942 --> 26:11.195
Okay, I will jazz hands if I--

26:11.279 --> 26:13.406
See how he talks to me?

26:30.506 --> 26:32.508
This is a private rehearsal.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.012
It's too bad because that train
deserves a premiere.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.057
Relax, it's a blend.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.561
So, what happened tonight?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.314
Just not feeling the fantasy?

26:47.189 --> 26:50.109
Everyone was drooling over
an acoustic duet.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.278
The lake just isn't ready
for Mulan Rouge.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.697
Ooh, they're a lot more ready
than when I was a kid.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.116
If I have to listen to one more
old gay

26:57.199 --> 26:59.285
crying about not being able to
wear a dress to school...

26:59.368 --> 27:02.621
Old gay? I'm barely thirty...

27:02.705 --> 27:04.081
five.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.960
Okay, yes.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.671
Maybe your elders
do get a little bit jealous

27:10.755 --> 27:12.173
watching you kids
get to do drag

27:12.256 --> 27:13.966
while we had to hide
in the library.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.220
This one time, I was hiding
from tetherball,

27:18.304 --> 27:20.222
and I was reading about
the Samurai Code

27:20.306 --> 27:22.892
and how the Samurais could
control their emotions.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.353
And I remember thinking
that if

27:25.436 --> 27:27.104
I could just figure out
how to do that,

27:27.188 --> 27:28.439
that nobody would
see how scared

27:28.522 --> 27:29.732
I was of being different.

27:30.816 --> 27:34.445
So your internalized homophobia
was culturally appropriating?

27:34.528 --> 27:36.238
Nice.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.908
Yeah, "Paris Is Burning."
I know, we steal everything.

27:40.368 --> 27:43.287
I wasn't scared.
Billie deserved to win.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.915
If I won, it would've only been
because I'm ten.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.416
And I won't be pitied.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.001
No, of course not.

27:50.878 --> 27:53.047
Grandpa Derrick would've wanted
Billie to win.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.217
He never got to meet her.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.555
Oh, well that, um...

28:03.057 --> 28:07.269
That's a very big, very not ten
thing that you did.

28:10.064 --> 28:11.482
Do you miss him?

28:12.650 --> 28:13.859
Sometimes.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.239
Yes.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.325
Me, too.

28:22.326 --> 28:25.287
You know, he always let
me beat his face.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.747
Dad let you hit him?

28:26.831 --> 28:29.667
Do his make up.
You sure you're only 35?

28:30.835 --> 28:33.087
Wuh-- Wow.

28:35.256 --> 28:36.465
That, uh...

28:37.299 --> 28:39.385
That really sounds like you
brought out the best in him.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.472
Even if I'm not his
real grandson.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.934
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, you
got to walk that back, Nicole.

28:47.017 --> 28:51.021
Now I'm Billie's birth dad,
but I'm not her real dad.

28:51.105 --> 28:52.815
There's room enough for both.

28:54.984 --> 28:57.778
Grandpa Derrick used to say
I reminded him of you.

28:58.904 --> 29:02.950
But I don't see it. You don't
know Cocteau or your colours.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.995
You are such a dink.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.166
All right. Spin her around one
more time, let me see this.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.042
I only got half the show.

29:12.126 --> 29:13.502
All right.

29:13.586 --> 29:17.173
"Sunset Lover"]

29:23.846 --> 29:26.515
- Do you have to go?
- You'll be fine.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.809
You learned how to canoe,

29:28.893 --> 29:30.978
how to jump off a cliff,

29:31.061 --> 29:33.314
and you won the talent show
all on your own.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.483
Yeah, because you literally
abandoned me on stage.

29:35.566 --> 29:38.194
You and Justin need to find
another move.

29:41.739 --> 29:43.282
You cannot leave me alone
with him

29:43.365 --> 29:44.408
for the rest of the summer.

29:45.409 --> 29:48.662
You and Justin both
have a hard time letting go.

29:48.746 --> 29:52.291
But if you do, he will too.

29:52.374 --> 29:55.127
And I think it's time that you
let him sleep inside again.

29:55.211 --> 29:56.712
Give me one good reason.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.595
You're pregnant.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.767
So in 16 years,

30:09.850 --> 30:13.979
when this one comes running to
you about some dumb shit I did,

30:14.063 --> 30:17.107
I hope you'll fight for me
like I'm fighting for you.

30:17.191 --> 30:18.526
That's why you came.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.569
I wanted to tell you in person.

30:20.653 --> 30:24.615
And I hope that you'll want
to be a part of their life.

30:25.366 --> 30:28.452
Just as much as Justin wants
to be a part of yours.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.260
- Hiya.
- Hi.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.305
Guess we're not gonna hang out,
huh?

30:48.389 --> 30:50.307
Next time, I promise.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.230
- Did you tell her?
- Hm?

30:56.313 --> 30:59.316
Please, you're, what,
like, four months along?

30:59.400 --> 31:01.485
What gave it away?

31:01.569 --> 31:04.780
You went up a cup size,
you only packed maxi dresses,

31:04.863 --> 31:06.615
and you're getting
all those tiny little baby zits

31:06.699 --> 31:09.868
- on your ass again.

31:09.952 --> 31:11.537
That and you've done
like zero cocaine

31:11.620 --> 31:12.955
the whole time
you've been here.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.750
- Stop--
- Get over here.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.464
Take care of her.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.801
I'm trying, I swear.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.219
- I know.
- Real hard.

31:27.303 --> 31:28.470
I know.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.599
So, who's the father?

31:32.224 --> 31:34.685
A sangria surprise.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.687
Oh!

31:38.188 --> 31:39.398
But...

31:39.982 --> 31:43.193
We're figuring it out.
You'd like him.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.945
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hm.

31:45.613 --> 31:46.947
All right.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.824
He's not gay, right?

31:48.907 --> 31:50.367
Cause I lost my gold
star for you,

31:50.451 --> 31:51.660
and that's got to count
for something.

31:51.744 --> 31:52.786
Stop.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.580
You're my one and only.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.707
acoustic cover]

31:56.790 --> 31:58.083
I know I am.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.026
Can I come in?

32:31.867 --> 32:33.160
Wow.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.416
So, you got some big news, huh?

32:40.292 --> 32:42.336
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.296
I'm going to be a big sister.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.591
So cool.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.015
You know,
it's okay if it's not.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.019
No, I can't wait
to tell mom and dad.

33:01.939 --> 33:04.316
Teesa's going to be
such a good mom.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.120
This was the day we gave
you to Oliver and Naomi.

33:20.249 --> 33:22.251
It was a really hard day.

33:24.837 --> 33:27.256
But that was a really
happy one too.
