{\an8}Hey, how about a little respect?

01:09.944 --> 01:10.487
{\an8}I just painted that!

01:14.574 --> 01:15.408
{\an8}Hey, Ginger.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.328
{\an8}Hey, guys.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.079
{\an8}Hello, Ginger.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.665
{\an8}Still walking the picket
line, Mrs. Foutley?

01:22.749 --> 01:23.500
{\an7}Yeah, but
I'm not worried.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.419
{\an7}We've got them
right where we want them.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.796
{\an8}Glad to hear it.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.131
{\an8}I'm overdue for
a medical emergency.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.092
Oops! And I'm overdue, period.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.636
Got to run.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.187
MACIE:
Lady Liberty...

01:44.270 --> 01:45.814
I always wanted to meet her.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.274
{\an1}I say it'll be
worth a nosebleed

01:48.358 --> 01:49.943
climbing to the top.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.194
Isn't it cute, Miranda?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.946
They think going
to New York City

01:53.029 --> 01:55.865
is about something
other than shopping.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.033
"Cute"? Let's call it

01:57.116 --> 01:59.702
{\an1}what they call it
in New York, "pathetic."

01:59.786 --> 02:01.329
(<i> laughing</i> )

02:01.746 --> 02:03.373
Hey, Ms. Zorksi.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.499
Hey, Ginger.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.750
Now, don't forget, guys,

02:05.834 --> 02:09.628
the $50 for the class trip
is due in two weeks.

02:10.295 --> 02:14.717
{\an4}MRS. FOUTLEY:
And then someone yelled,
"Strike!" again.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.970
{\an1}So, to make
a long story short,

02:17.053 --> 02:18.555
{\an1}negotiations
completely broke down.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.057
We're back to square one.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.517
But square one
was six weeks ago.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.686
So remind me.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.106
If we had any more money
in our savings account,

02:28.189 --> 02:30.358
we'd be broke.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.194
No, no, we're okay,

02:33.278 --> 02:36.489
{\an1}but I got to start
bringing some money in.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.575
Any ideas?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.535
{\an1}Remember that crazy
vampire cleaning business

02:40.618 --> 02:42.495
of your brother's?

02:42.579 --> 02:43.037
Yeah...

02:43.121 --> 02:44.873
Well, that's my idea;

02:44.956 --> 02:46.124
only I'm skipping
the vampire part.

02:46.207 --> 02:50.420
But if you clean houses,
that'll make you...

02:50.503 --> 02:52.589
Employed.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.965
Well, cleaning's
dangerous, isn't it?

02:54.048 --> 02:55.967
I mean, you could
hurt yourself.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.595
You actually have
to lift furniture

02:58.678 --> 03:00.972
and clean under it,

03:01.055 --> 03:03.266
not around it,
like we do here.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.392
Do you have any idea

03:04.475 --> 03:06.644
how many
heavier-than-furniture patients

03:06.728 --> 03:08.062
I've lifted and cleaned under?

03:08.146 --> 03:10.315
{\an1}Anyway, I've
already sent Carl out

03:10.398 --> 03:11.441
to hang up fliers.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.942
Fliers?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.819
But everyone will see them.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.613
Here's hoping!

03:16.696 --> 03:19.532
Hey, I should tape
one up on the car.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.034
A moving flier beats one

03:21.117 --> 03:24.954
stuck up on a super market
bulletin board-- more eyeballs.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.998
But, Mom, cleaning
is so boring.

03:27.081 --> 03:31.085
{\an5}There's lots of
more interesting
jobs you could do.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.420
{\an1}Well, when you
think of one

03:32.503 --> 03:33.880
{\an1}where I don't need
a new wardrobe

03:33.963 --> 03:36.966
{\an5}or have to pass
a typing test,
you let me know.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.801
Until then, I clean.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.346
{\an1}I'm the man
of the house, Hoods.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.221
Adhesive.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.307
(<i> spits</i> )

03:45.558 --> 03:46.392
And I've got certain

03:46.476 --> 03:48.478
{\an1}familial obligations
to the momster

03:48.561 --> 03:49.270
in her time of need.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.940
{\an1}Adhesive.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.652
{\an4}HOODSEY:
You mean, like, helping her
haul in some lettuce?

03:55.735 --> 03:58.738
Bingo, my friend.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.741
(<i> whimpers</i> )

04:03.076 --> 04:05.411
(<i> screaming</i> )

04:05.495 --> 04:08.498
Don't you dare touch
my princess, you...

04:08.581 --> 04:10.667
Oh, Carl, Robert.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.918
Principal Milty!

04:12.001 --> 04:13.336
{\an1}We didn't do anything,
I swear!

04:13.419 --> 04:16.755
Whoa! Is my precious,
little girl all right?

04:16.839 --> 04:19.550
Look at you, little...

04:19.634 --> 04:21.094
(<i> panting</i> )

04:21.177 --> 04:23.596
{\an1}So this vicious mutt
is yours?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.515
"Vicious mutt"?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.558
{\an1}Carl, it's The Duchess,
remember?

04:27.642 --> 04:29.477
Please, I know her
only as the dog

04:29.560 --> 04:32.689
who caused you severe
psychological damage.

04:32.772 --> 04:33.940
But I feel...

04:34.023 --> 04:36.109
I nearly wet my pants!

04:36.192 --> 04:36.818
Hear that?

04:36.901 --> 04:37.402
We're talking lawsuit.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.612
{\an3}Lawsuit?

04:39.696 --> 04:42.323
And of course, you also
broke the leash law...

04:42.407 --> 04:43.366
What leash law?

04:43.449 --> 04:44.701
Come on now, you're
making that up.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.786
(<i> clears throat</i> )

04:46.869 --> 04:49.539
Code 423 of the city's
municipal charter...

04:49.622 --> 04:51.374
{\an1}Which reads as follows,
verbatim:

04:51.457 --> 04:54.502
{\an1}"All dogs must be
confined to a leash..."

04:54.585 --> 04:55.420
{\an3}MILTY:
Stop!

04:55.503 --> 04:56.045
Glad to see
the two of you

04:56.129 --> 04:58.631
have been studying
something.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.674
Now, what
are you after?

04:59.757 --> 05:02.468
{\an1}Face it, the pooch
could use some training,

05:02.552 --> 05:05.221
{\an1}and for a mere... $20,
I offer my services

05:05.304 --> 05:08.516
{\an5}Mm-hmm, and just what
kind of experience
have you had?

05:08.599 --> 05:10.768
You should have seen
Robert Joseph

05:10.852 --> 05:11.728
before I got
my hands on him.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.147
I was a real mess.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.190
{\an1}You couldn't
take me anywhere.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.817
{\an1}But now, even a fancy
relish fork

05:17.900 --> 05:20.069
{\an1}don't intimidate
me none.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.030
{\an5}MILTY:
What does
my $20 buy me...

05:22.113 --> 05:23.823
aside from out
of a lawsuit?

05:23.906 --> 05:24.782
Uh, the basic
package, you know,

05:24.866 --> 05:27.702
heeling, sitting, et cetera.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.078
Et cetera, hmm?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.456
{\an1}All right, but I'm only
giving you two weeks.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.334
{\an1}If she's not up
to speed by then,

05:34.417 --> 05:34.709
you don't get your 20.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.627
No problemo.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.463
Professional
experience tells me

05:38.546 --> 05:40.131
she's a quick study.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.887
And the calls keep coming in.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.182
She's been at it
for almost a week now.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.808
Well, that's okay,
isn't it?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.727
It means she's good
at her work.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.020
(<i> groans</i> )

05:54.103 --> 05:55.438
There's nothing wrong

05:55.521 --> 05:57.023
with cleaning for a living...
is there?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.942
Not if you're
a house cleaner.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.612
But my mom's a nurse--
or was a nurse--

06:02.695 --> 06:05.323
and now everyone's
going to find out

06:05.406 --> 06:06.783
because of those
stupid fliers.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.535
But it's only
temporary.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.080
She's still a nurse;
she's just on strike.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.289
And people are nicer
than you think.

06:13.372 --> 06:17.877
No one's going to care
if she's cleaning houses.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.420
You think so?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.630
Absolutely.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.631
But, as
a precaution,

06:21.714 --> 06:22.965
we haven't said
anything to anyone.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.384
See? You guys do know
what I'm talking about.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.136
Everyone pretends
they don't care,

06:27.220 --> 06:30.223
but they really do,
and people will pity you.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.265
We wouldn't
do that.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.894
I know, but plenty
of other people would.

06:34.977 --> 06:38.856
It's only a matter of time
before word gets out.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.483
Then there's
no need to worry

06:40.566 --> 06:41.901
because in just
a matter of time,

06:41.984 --> 06:43.986
you'll be out of town,

06:44.070 --> 06:46.614
strolling the boulevards
of New York.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.156
Avenues,<i> mon amie.</i>

06:47.240 --> 06:49.784
Boulevards are in Paris.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.036
Yeah, we'll see
about that.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.124
(<i> ringing</i> )

06:57.333 --> 07:00.211
Ginger, could I talk
to you for a minute?

07:00.294 --> 07:02.380
Catch up with you
later, guys.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.340
I've been
following the news,

07:04.423 --> 07:05.258
and the nurses's strike

07:05.341 --> 07:08.427
has been going on
for a while now.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.679
Everything
okay at home?

07:09.762 --> 07:10.888
GINGER:
My mom likes to think of it

07:10.972 --> 07:13.057
as a no-pay vacation.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.144
{\an5}The $50 for
the New York trip
is pretty steep.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.939
{\an5}GINGER:
Oh, oh,
we have the money.

07:20.022 --> 07:20.731
We don't have the money.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.692
But, Mom...

07:22.775 --> 07:23.693
{\an1}$50 is a lot for us
right now, Ginge.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.196
{\an4}The cleaning money
is barely covering
the basics.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.991
{\an1}Sorry, but we can't
afford that trip.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.368
But if I don't go, everyone
will think that I'm...

07:32.451 --> 07:35.746
I thought calls were coming in
left and right.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.874
{\an1}They are, but I'm
a one-woman operation.

07:37.957 --> 07:41.586
{\an1}There's only so many houses
I could clean in a day.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.712
(<i> moans</i> )

07:42.795 --> 07:44.172
Unless...

07:44.255 --> 07:47.091
Well, if you help me
clean houses after school,

07:47.175 --> 07:48.551
I could clean
more of them.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.721
Me... be a cleaning lady?

07:51.804 --> 07:54.932
{\an1}I could send some
extra cash your way.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.684
{\an1}You could earn the money
for the trip.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.936
{\an1}It's the only way I can see
getting you there.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.690
Uh... okay, but...

08:02.773 --> 08:06.694
{\an1}do those vampire costumes
come with masks?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.579
MRS. FOUTLEY:
Ginger, wait up!

08:16.662 --> 08:18.956
Can't-- fast wheels!

08:22.001 --> 08:24.503
(<i> panting</i> )

08:25.254 --> 08:26.380
Jeesh, what's the rush?

08:26.464 --> 08:29.967
It's like you robbed
the place or something.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.594
Okay, since
you unloaded,

08:31.677 --> 08:33.261
I'll bring
the cart back.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.804
Why? Just leave it.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.765
I want to get
my quarter back.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.767
{\an1}Hurry!

08:37.850 --> 08:39.977
(<i> groans</i> )

08:40.061 --> 08:41.520
(<i> gasps</i> )

08:41.604 --> 08:45.775
{\an4}MIRANDA:
We looked for clothes
for you yesterday as well.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.027
Do you remember?

08:48.110 --> 08:50.696
{\an5}We didn't find
anything that
really looked great.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.658
{\an1}Yes, we did,
as a matter of fact...

08:53.741 --> 08:55.660
What are you
doing back there?

08:55.743 --> 08:56.953
Just floor it!

08:57.036 --> 08:58.246
All right, all right.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.205
{\an1}Hey, what happened
to my sign?

08:59.288 --> 09:01.624
Probably under
the supplies.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.543
I'll look for it
when we get home.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.920
Let's just
get out of here.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.507
No big deal.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.509
I was going to take
it down anyway.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.136
I'm thinking of giving
the business a name:

09:14.220 --> 09:16.305
"Lois's Spit &amp; Polish,"
something like that.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.933
Anyway, I'll need
new fliers.

09:19.016 --> 09:21.435
But, Mom, you can't
name the business.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.729
{\an1}That'll only make
it permanent.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.814
And it's not, right?

09:24.897 --> 09:26.274
Ginger, I don't
know how long

09:26.357 --> 09:27.191
this strike
is going to last.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.234
And you got
to come up

09:28.317 --> 09:29.986
with a name
people remember.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.447
(<i> groans</i> )

09:35.241 --> 09:38.661
(<i> dog panting</i> )

09:38.744 --> 09:42.164
Come on, Duchess,
it's called "playing dead."

09:42.248 --> 09:44.542
That's like Dog Training 101.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.127
"The Duchess," Carl,

09:46.210 --> 09:48.254
{\an1}and this is
Dog Training 101.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.338
"Duchess" is bad enough.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.841
Why add a lame-o "The"
in front of it?

09:51.924 --> 09:52.758
{\an1}Well, how would
you like it

09:52.842 --> 09:55.261
{\an4}if someone
called you "Arl"
instead of "Carl"?

09:55.344 --> 09:57.096
You're hurting
her feelings.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.557
(<i> whimpers</i> )

09:59.640 --> 10:02.852
You know, all you've
been doing is criticizing.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.478
{\an1}Duh, because you're
doing everything wrong.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.857
And I suppose you
could do it better?

10:07.940 --> 10:08.816
Better than you.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.360
Well, then be my guest.

10:12.778 --> 10:13.362
No, that's okay.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.365
I don't mind
being a spectator

10:16.449 --> 10:18.909
and, um... spectating.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.540
Once you get
the hang of cleaning,

10:24.623 --> 10:26.334
it's not so bad.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.710
Oh, yeah, right.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.920
{\an1}I'm kind of glad
you're coming along.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.255
It's been lonely.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.257
I'm so used to people
at the hospital.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.134
There's always
someone to talk to.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.887
{\an1}When you clean,
you mostly talk to yourself,

10:37.970 --> 10:39.805
and that can't be good.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.146
It looks familiar.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.148
{\an5}GINGER:
What do you think
it's supposed to be?

10:49.231 --> 10:51.359
I'm not sure.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.152
Think it can survive
a blast of Dust-Away?

10:53.235 --> 10:56.072
They said
clean everything.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.406
{\an1}Well, if any paint
comes off,

10:57.490 --> 10:58.532
{\an1}it'll come out
of my half.

10:58.616 --> 11:02.745
Mom, doesn't cleaning
houses embarrass you?

11:02.828 --> 11:03.746
Why should it?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.581
Because you're not
a trained house cleaner.

11:05.664 --> 11:08.542
You're a trained nurse,
and this isn't nursing.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.336
{\an1}Look, Ginge,
I'm not going to say

11:10.419 --> 11:12.588
{\an1}I don't miss my job
because I do.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.798
But I got to be honest--

11:13.881 --> 11:15.591
{\an1}cleaning houses
doesn't bother me.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.094
{\an1}So you haven't told
anyone at school about me?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.388
Only Dodie and Macie.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.348
{\an1}Do they know
you're helping now?

11:22.431 --> 11:23.724
They're my best friends.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.768
{\an1}Well, the strike
can't last forever.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.311
{\an1}I'm ever
the optimist, Ginge.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.521
Know what that means?

11:28.604 --> 11:31.107
You don't think any
paint will come off

11:31.190 --> 11:32.775
if I spray
the sculpture?

11:32.858 --> 11:34.443
Close enough.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.909
That's it!

11:42.868 --> 11:44.286
It's Jimmy...

11:44.370 --> 11:45.830
an old boyfriend.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.624
Yep, same height,
same build.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.127
All that's missing
is the mono-brow.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.461
{\an1}Mono-brow?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.548
(<i> laughing</i> )

11:56.298 --> 11:57.800
When did you live
in New York City?

11:57.883 --> 12:01.345
{\an4}The summer after
my sophomore year
of nursing school.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.431
{\an1}I wasn't sure
I wanted to go back,

12:03.514 --> 12:04.056
it had been so tough.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.434
Oh, I was burnt out.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.310
{\an1}So anyway, a friend and I
sublet an apartment

12:08.394 --> 12:10.646
in Greenwich Village.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.231
<i>The</i> Greenwich
Village?

12:12.314 --> 12:13.899
Like, with Beatniks
and poets?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.776
{\an1}More like
the Greenwich Village

12:15.860 --> 12:18.904
{\an1}of investment bankers
and Korean delis.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.823
That is so cool.

12:20.906 --> 12:21.532
By day, I worked,

12:21.615 --> 12:24.827
{\an1}but by night,
I danced up a storm.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.706
I was kind of a legend,
if only for the summer.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.917
{\an4}I even climbed
to the top of the
Statue of Liberty...

12:32.001 --> 12:34.086
{\an1}in Lucite platforms,
no less.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.337
(<i> laughs</i> )

12:35.421 --> 12:37.381
Look what I found
in the pool house.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.175
{\an1}They're a little damp,
but...

12:39.258 --> 12:40.050
How about a game?

12:40.134 --> 12:42.803
We got to do something
until the floor dries.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.514
What were we thinking,
mopping to the middle?

12:45.598 --> 12:48.184
Classic beginner's mistake.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.518
Won't happen again.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.269
Hearts or Crazy Eights?

12:50.352 --> 12:52.188
Dealer's choice.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.732
Gin Rummy it is.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.695
(<i> school bell ringing</i> )

12:59.778 --> 13:02.907
(<i> kids chattering</i> )

13:04.074 --> 13:08.370
And then she told me
about her very first kiss.

13:08.454 --> 13:12.541
{\an4}Your mom divulged
an intimate detail
like that?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.753
My mom won't even let me touch
her Waterpik.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.046
Sorry, guys,
got to go.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.548
{\an4}Ginger, you've got
to take a day off
sometime.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.052
Can't-- want to meet my mom.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.388
Did she say, "Got to"
or "Want to"?

13:26.472 --> 13:27.097
Did she say, "Got to"
or "Want to"?

13:27.181 --> 13:29.975
{\an1}"Want to."

13:30.392 --> 13:31.143
On the count
of three, okay?

13:31.227 --> 13:33.187
{\an1}Make it the count
of four-- it's heavy.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.398
One, two, three...

13:36.482 --> 13:37.233
Four.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.527
(<i> grunting</i> )

13:39.610 --> 13:40.402
(<i> panting</i> )

13:40.486 --> 13:43.822
Okay, maybe next time
on the count of five.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.324
(<i> laughs</i> )

13:46.450 --> 13:49.995
How about "L and G
Clean to a T"?

13:50.079 --> 13:50.955
No, too corny.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.082
I'll come up with
something better.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.416
Uh, wait a minute, Ginge.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.710
I don't want you thinking
this is permanent.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.881
{\an5}I'm worried
I'm violating a
child labor law.

14:00.965 --> 14:05.052
{\an5}Maybe you need a milk
and graham cracker break
every two hours.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.053
Chill, Lois.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.806
{\an1}You're starting
to sound like my mother.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.517
(<i> both laughing</i> )

14:20.150 --> 14:22.278
(<i> stops bike</i> )

14:22.361 --> 14:23.279
(<i> drops bike</i> )

14:23.362 --> 14:25.197
(<i> gasps</i> )

14:25.281 --> 14:27.700
What is...

14:27.783 --> 14:30.452
So Ginger's mother
is cleaning houses.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.788
I hope she does windows.

14:32.871 --> 14:36.917
(<i> cackles evilly</i> )

14:37.001 --> 14:39.628
(<i> whimpering</i> )

14:39.712 --> 14:41.422
(<i> continues cackling</i> )

14:41.505 --> 14:45.676
(<i> children crying</i> )

14:48.387 --> 14:49.888
You've already
earned the money.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.641
Why are you still
cleaning houses?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.352
{\an1}This is going
to sound really weird,

14:55.436 --> 14:58.397
{\an1}but it's been fun
hanging out with my mom.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.650
{\an5}I don't even mind
the cleaning thing
so much anymore.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.528
{\an5}DODIE:
Ginger, do you realize
what this means?

15:04.612 --> 15:07.990
{\an5}You've achieved
"friendship" status
with your mother.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.409
You're, like, 20 years
ahead of schedule.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.454
Hey, maybe you're right.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.499
(<i> maliciously</i> ):
Hi, Ginger.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.336
{\an1}Wow! That sounded
creepier than usual.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.254
Hi, Miranda.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.964
What's up?

15:24.048 --> 15:25.841
I'm so glad you asked.

15:25.924 --> 15:26.842
The Griplings' maid
is on vacation,

15:26.925 --> 15:30.346
and they're desperate
for a cleaning service.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.973
And even though there are plenty
of fliers around

15:33.057 --> 15:34.892
advertising them,
could you recommend anyone,

15:34.975 --> 15:38.562
since the Griplings
are so particular?

15:38.646 --> 15:39.355
{\an1}Not me.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.314
Likewise.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.440
{\an1}How about you,
Ginger?

15:41.523 --> 15:42.566
(<i> bell ringing</i> )

15:42.650 --> 15:43.817
Sorry, got to go.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.277
I have class.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.655
{\an1}Ginger, what was that
all about?

15:47.738 --> 15:49.406
I'll tell you what it was about,
cowboy.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.785
Miranda knows.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.331
(<i> groans</i> )

15:59.124 --> 16:00.459
{\an1}I'm a little
confused here.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.629
{\an4}You were okay
with your mom
cleaning houses.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.923
I am-- I mean...

16:06.006 --> 16:06.757
I was.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.593
Oh, no, I'm back at square one.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.344
How did that happen?

16:10.427 --> 16:12.513
Easy.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.640
You're worried Courtney's going
to call your mom

16:14.723 --> 16:15.474
to clean their house.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.393
{\an1}And everyone knows
impending humiliation

16:17.476 --> 16:18.727
by one's peers

16:18.811 --> 16:20.813
is the fastest way
back to square one.

16:20.896 --> 16:25.567
But, Ginger, your mom's
a peer now, too.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.443
Macie's right.

16:26.527 --> 16:30.948
She won't take the job
if you ask her not to.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.536
Come on, girl, you can do it.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.414
Yes, you can, you pretty girl.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.249
Ready? Sit up.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.959
Hoods, this good-cop
method of yours is squash.

16:42.042 --> 16:46.422
Either that, or the mutt's short
a million brain cells.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.841
Carl, The Duchess
is very sensitive,

16:48.924 --> 16:51.301
and she's reading
your negative vibe, big time.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.344
Okay, girl.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.055
Now sit up.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.602
Carl, I think
she did it!

17:00.686 --> 17:02.479
Come on, The Duchess,
sit up.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.564
(<i> barks</i> )

17:03.647 --> 17:05.566
{\an1}Well, I'll be
a monkey's uncle!

17:05.648 --> 17:07.443
{\an1}Which I hope to be
someday.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.737
That pooch did it.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.865
{\an4}With considerable help
from the trainer,
of course.

17:12.948 --> 17:13.741
(<i> barks</i> )

17:13.824 --> 17:16.326
Well, she did do
most of the work.

17:16.410 --> 17:22.124
Didn't you? Yes, you did,
you precious little...

17:22.207 --> 17:23.040
Hoods, please.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.002
{\an1}Try not to go Milty
on me.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.088
But she's so cute.

18:21.433 --> 18:26.105
{\an5}GINGER:
And then Miranda got
this evil look on her face,

18:26.188 --> 18:27.314
which means...

18:27.397 --> 18:31.026
{\an1}The Griplings already
called for a house cleaning.

18:31.109 --> 18:32.861
Well, I say we don't go.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.405
{\an1}Look, I understand
if <i> you're</i> too embarrassed,

18:35.489 --> 18:37.783
{\an1}but the money's too good
for me to pass up.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.201
But, Mom, I don't
want you to go.

18:39.284 --> 18:43.705
Miranda and Courtney
just want to make you feel bad.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.542
{\an5}Ginger, they can't
make me feel bad
about it

18:46.625 --> 18:49.211
because I don't
feel bad about it.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.462
Now wish me luck.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.466
{\an5}I hear they got
20-foot ceilings
and crown moldings.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.305
{\an1}(<i> barks</i> )

19:00.389 --> 19:02.683
Well, boys, I guess
I owe you a thanks.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.893
A thanks is nice,

19:04.977 --> 19:07.145
but the $20 would
be nicer.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.731
All right, of course.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.905
(<i> screams</i> )

19:16.989 --> 19:18.323
That's an antique.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.783
You call this training?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.744
The basic package doesn't cover
inappropriate chewing.

19:22.828 --> 19:26.415
{\an5}Right, you should
have ordered the
basic-plus package.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.708
{\an1}That's it!
The deal's off!

19:27.791 --> 19:29.251
{\an1}Hey, hey, we had
a verbal agreement,

19:29.334 --> 19:32.671
{\an4}which is considered
legally binding
in this state.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.590
You're making that up.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.925
We'd never do that-- honest!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.135
{\an1}Nice attitude,
Hoods.

19:38.218 --> 19:41.430
{\an4}Remember that
when we're in front
of the judge.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.348
{\an3}Right.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.474
You can't scare me.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.643
I don't know.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.188
{\an4}We can look
pretty pathetic
when we want to.

19:51.106 --> 19:54.318
(<i> muttering</i> ):
Oh, 20 bucks...

19:54.401 --> 19:55.193
20 bucks!

19:55.277 --> 19:56.278
Thanks, Milt.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.114
Don't forgot to mention us
to your friends.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.241
Out!

20:02.534 --> 20:02.951
(<i> chuckling</i> )

20:03.035 --> 20:03.952
{\an1}See you,
The Duchess.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.247
Hey, you said it right
that time.

20:07.331 --> 20:12.169
{\an5}COURTNEY:
Miranda, the Foutleys
have fallen on hard times,

20:12.252 --> 20:14.463
so don't make Mrs. Foutley feel

20:14.546 --> 20:15.839
any more downtrodden.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.217
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

20:19.760 --> 20:23.972
Mrs. Foutley,
you poor woman.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.016
{\an1}Good to see you again,
Courtney.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.727
You, too, Miranda.

20:29.728 --> 20:33.649
And has everything been
just terrible for you?

20:33.732 --> 20:35.484
No more than usual.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.152
Things usually
are pretty good,

20:37.235 --> 20:39.988
so I guess things
ain't half bad.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.990
Mrs. Foutley is
failing to notice

20:42.074 --> 20:43.575
my sympathy
to her plight.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.161
{\an1}Lay it on
a little thicker.

20:46.244 --> 20:46.912
Good idea.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.038
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

20:48.121 --> 20:49.247
Oh, darn.

20:49.331 --> 20:53.001
Ginger, what
brings you here?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.461
Not that we mind.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.005
I'm part of the cleaning crew.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.048
You mean, you...

20:58.131 --> 21:00.300
Well, if it isn't
my partner in crime.

21:00.384 --> 21:05.180
{\an5}Face it, Lois,
this job's too big
for one person.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.100
Miranda, it's worse
than I thought.

21:08.183 --> 21:08.892
(<i> cackles</i> )

21:08.976 --> 21:10.894
{\an1}It's better
than I thought.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.270
They're
destitute.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.855
{\an1}Let's go
remind them.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.192
{\an5}LOIS:
Hey, how about <i> we</i> go
to New York sometime?

21:17.275 --> 21:18.026
Like you, me and Carl?

21:18.110 --> 21:21.530
I was thinking more
like the two of us.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.241
{\an5}I don't think
the Big Apple's ready
for the Big Carl.

21:24.324 --> 21:28.286
{\an5}It'll be like a
girls-only weekend
in New York.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.080
Sounds good to me.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.874
{\an5}How come Mama and I
never have this
kind of fun?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.626
We've had
hard times, too.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.794
What hard times?

21:35.877 --> 21:40.507
{\an5}Well, like when
she lost the platinum
card in Jamaica.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.633
{\an1}Please, they replaced it
in three hours.

21:41.717 --> 21:46.096
{\an5}The longest
three hours of my life,
thank you very much.

21:46.179 --> 21:49.641
{\an4}Someone needs to
remind them they're
just house cleaners

21:49.725 --> 21:51.935
{\an1}who can't afford to go
to New York.

21:52.019 --> 21:52.602
{\an3}Let me.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.522
I've had experience
with help.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.107
Yoo-hoo.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.191
You missed a spot.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.528
Courtney, that's
your reflection.

22:01.611 --> 22:02.738
{\an3}It is?

22:02.821 --> 22:05.365
Can we put a shine
on a floor, or what?

22:05.449 --> 22:08.744
(<i> gasps</i> ):
I didn't think it was possible.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.204
Neither did I.

22:11.288 --> 22:15.751
{\an5}I look even better
reflected in a floor
than in a mirror.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.836
(<i> groans</i> )

22:17.919 --> 22:18.962
{\an4}GINGER:
And then we climbed
all the way

22:19.046 --> 22:21.923
{\an1}to the top of
the Statue of Liberty.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.216
Macie only fainted once.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.011
Only once?
I'm impressed.

22:26.094 --> 22:29.639
{\an5}Oh, sounds like
the trip was a lot
of fun.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.477
{\an4}So clean any
interesting houses
while I was away?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.896
I found the Corellis'
pet boa constrictor

22:35.979 --> 22:37.773
when I was going over
their TV room.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.650
{\an5}Carl claims he heard
my screams all the way
over here,

22:40.734 --> 22:43.737
{\an5}but you know how
your brother likes
to exaggerate.
