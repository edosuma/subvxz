01:05.513 --> 01:09.820
53 percent of the American
workforce is female,

01:09.953 --> 01:15.258
three generations of women
that turned 1,000 years
of tradition on its ear.

01:15.392 --> 01:17.227
As little girls,
they were told to grow up

01:17.260 --> 01:19.496
and marry doctors
and lawyers.

01:19.529 --> 01:23.500
Instead they grew up
and became doctors
and lawyers.

01:23.533 --> 01:24.901
They moved out
of the pink ghetto

01:24.934 --> 01:27.637
and into
the executive suite.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.772
Sociologists say
the new working woman

01:29.806 --> 01:31.541
is a phenomenon
of our time.

01:34.544 --> 01:36.779
Take J.C. Wiatt,
for example.

01:36.813 --> 01:38.781
Graduated first
in her class at Yale,

01:38.815 --> 01:40.917
got her MBA at Harvard,

01:40.950 --> 01:44.521
has a corner office
at the corner of
58th and Park.

01:44.554 --> 01:47.390
She works 5:00 to 9:00,
she makes six figures a year,

01:47.424 --> 01:49.526
and they call her
"The Tiger Lady."

01:49.559 --> 01:50.993
Married to her job,

01:51.027 --> 01:54.531
she lives with
an investment banker
married to his.

01:54.564 --> 01:57.400
They collect African art,
co-own their co-op,

01:57.434 --> 02:00.803
and have separate
but equal IRA accounts.

02:00.837 --> 02:03.573
One would take it
for granted that a woman
like this has it all.

02:05.308 --> 02:07.444
One must never take
anything for granted.

02:14.584 --> 02:16.553
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't get it.

02:16.586 --> 02:18.555
Atlantic Overseas
isn't just having
a slow quarter.

02:18.588 --> 02:21.424
The way they're going,
they may not be flying
to Newark in six months.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.293
Don't you think...
Ken. Ken.

02:23.326 --> 02:25.295
A company can't lose
$25 million a quarter

02:25.328 --> 02:26.763
and expect
to stay in business.

02:26.796 --> 02:29.432
They've got to streamline
their organization,
reduce headquarters' staff,

02:29.466 --> 02:30.967
get rid of operating
bottlenecks,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.703
and then we'll
be able to focus
on the real soft spot.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.572
What?
Well, you're good.

02:35.605 --> 02:37.440
Oh.
I see you're just
realizing this?

02:37.474 --> 02:38.975
Robin, I need
the flash report
in time for my meeting.

02:39.008 --> 02:40.710
Got it.
Good.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.712
I also need
the latest info
on the IBC merger.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.113
Right.
What's going on?

02:44.146 --> 02:46.583
Oh, Steven just called.
He wants to know if 9:00
is okay for dinner.

02:46.616 --> 02:48.585
Oh.
Melnicker called twice,
he said it was urgent.

02:48.618 --> 02:49.852
And I need you
to sign these.

02:49.886 --> 02:51.588
Legal's been screaming
for them.

02:51.621 --> 02:53.856
Okay, now, Sheldrick
moved up the deadline
on Consolidated,

02:53.890 --> 02:55.325
so don't make any plans
for the weekend.

02:55.358 --> 02:56.593
This weekend?

02:56.626 --> 02:58.595
Is there a problem?

02:58.628 --> 02:59.596
No, it's just that
I have tickets
to the ballet

02:59.629 --> 03:01.631
that I've waited
six months...

03:03.366 --> 03:05.001
No problem.

03:05.034 --> 03:06.336
All right. Tell Steven
9:00 is fine for dinner

03:06.369 --> 03:07.604
and see if you can
get us into Jams.

03:07.637 --> 03:08.605
And if they don't
have a good table,

03:08.638 --> 03:10.006
try and get
something else.

03:10.039 --> 03:11.874
Ken, I need the PNLs
on Atlantic Overseas.
Right.

03:11.908 --> 03:13.876
I also need the latest
ZBBs AND PBBs.

03:13.910 --> 03:17.614
And, Robin,
I want you to get me
the CEO of IBC ASAP.

03:17.647 --> 03:19.349
Excuse me,
Miss Wiatt.
Uh-huh?

03:19.382 --> 03:21.017
Mr. Curtis wants
to know if you're free
for dinner tonight.

03:21.050 --> 03:22.919
Absolutely.
Cancel Steven.

03:24.921 --> 03:26.389
And good morning
to you, too, Miss Wiatt.

03:28.391 --> 03:32.028
Okay, the Montana lamb
with roquette-leaf
and goat-cheese salad,

03:32.061 --> 03:34.364
and the lime-grilled
free-range chicken

03:34.397 --> 03:37.033
with the pumpkin pasta
and dandelion greens.

03:37.066 --> 03:38.368
Looks fabulous.

03:38.401 --> 03:39.902
Enjoy.
Thanks.

03:39.936 --> 03:41.037
I'm Phillip
if you need me.

03:41.070 --> 03:42.405
Thank you.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.645
Tell me,
what do you know
about Hughes Larrabee?

03:48.678 --> 03:50.046
He's the CEO
of The Food Chain.

03:50.079 --> 03:51.781
He used to be
the CEO of Avon.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.384
He's a killer.
Real smart, no bullshit.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.519
I never met him. Why?

03:56.553 --> 03:58.655
He called.
They wanna talk.
Mmm-hmm.

03:58.688 --> 04:00.523
I thought they were
with Mackenzie.

04:00.557 --> 04:02.392
Well, apparently
they're shopping around.

04:02.425 --> 04:05.395
I set up a lunch
for you at The Pierre.

04:05.428 --> 04:08.398
Oh, I would love
to steal an account
from Mackenzie.

04:08.431 --> 04:09.699
I would just love it.

04:10.433 --> 04:11.368
J.C.
Mmm-hmm.

04:13.436 --> 04:15.672
You know I think
you're enormously
talented.

04:15.705 --> 04:17.540
Fritz, are you
leaving the company
or something?

04:17.574 --> 04:19.541
No.
Am I leaving
the company?

04:19.576 --> 04:21.944
Christ,
let me get it out.
No? Sorry.

04:21.978 --> 04:22.979
No.

04:24.113 --> 04:25.982
I want you to become
a partner.

04:28.117 --> 04:29.318
Oh.

04:30.987 --> 04:32.321
Oh, well.

04:33.990 --> 04:36.693
I accept. This is...
This is great, Fritz.

04:36.726 --> 04:39.962
This is very exciting. Wow.

04:39.996 --> 04:41.431
Of course
I have to discuss it
with Everett,

04:41.464 --> 04:42.932
but I'll do that
on the plane tomorrow.

04:42.965 --> 04:45.435
I hope he remembers me.
Because, you know,
I only met him a few times.

04:45.468 --> 04:48.471
You reel in The Food Chain,
he'll remember you,
I promise you.

04:49.606 --> 04:50.607
Well.

04:51.741 --> 04:53.576
J.C., let me ask you
something.

04:53.610 --> 04:55.111
How many hours a week
do you work now?

04:55.144 --> 04:57.580
I don't know.
What, 70, 80?

04:57.614 --> 05:01.451
Well, realize as a partner,
the hours are only
gonna get worse.

05:01.484 --> 05:02.719
I never complain about
these things, Fritz.
Yeah, I know.

05:02.752 --> 05:05.121
You know me.
I like work.
I know.

05:05.154 --> 05:07.724
Yeah, I know.
I know. Okay.
You know that I...

05:07.757 --> 05:09.459
Just let me get this
off my chest, okay?

05:09.492 --> 05:10.493
Sure.

05:11.027 --> 05:12.462
Now...

05:14.030 --> 05:15.498
What's that knocking?

05:16.766 --> 05:21.471
Well, never mind. Look,
you know that normally

05:21.504 --> 05:23.606
I don't think of you
as a woman,

05:23.640 --> 05:25.742
but in this case,

05:25.775 --> 05:28.377
I do have to
look at you as
a woman/partner.

05:29.646 --> 05:30.647
I mean...

05:32.782 --> 05:35.485
What if you and Steven
decide to get married
somewhere down the line?

05:35.518 --> 05:37.620
I mean,
what if he expects a wife?

05:37.654 --> 05:39.388
Fritz, first of all,
may I?
Mmm.

05:40.523 --> 05:42.024
Steven and I are not
getting married.

05:42.058 --> 05:43.159
And secondly,
you know how we are.

05:43.192 --> 05:44.160
We both eat, sleep
and dream our work.

05:44.193 --> 05:46.028
That's why we're together.

05:46.062 --> 05:49.632
Fritz, I understand
what it takes to make it.

05:49.666 --> 05:53.035
But do you understand
the sacrifices you're
gonna have to make?

05:53.069 --> 05:55.772
I mean, a man can
be a success

05:55.805 --> 05:58.174
and still have
a personal life.
A full personal life.

05:58.207 --> 06:00.910
My wife is there for me
whenever I need her.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.813
I mean, she raises the kids,
she decorates, she...

06:05.815 --> 06:08.184
Well, I don't know
what the hell she does,

06:08.217 --> 06:09.686
but she takes
care of things.

06:10.820 --> 06:11.821
I guess

06:13.222 --> 06:15.091
what I'm saying
is I'm lucky.

06:16.225 --> 06:17.694
I can have it all.

06:19.228 --> 06:21.097
Is that what
you're worried about?

06:21.698 --> 06:22.832
Forget it.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.434
I don't want it all.

06:26.836 --> 06:27.837
I don't.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.209
How would you
like an Akita as
a partnership present?

06:33.242 --> 06:34.677
J.C.: A dog?

06:34.711 --> 06:36.679
Yeah, I thought
you loved them.

06:36.713 --> 06:38.548
Oh, I love
looking at them,
but owning one?

06:38.581 --> 06:40.683
You'd have to feed it
and walk it,

06:40.717 --> 06:42.218
we'd have
hair everywhere.

06:42.251 --> 06:43.686
What if it died?

06:43.720 --> 06:45.087
Jeez, it was
just a thought.

06:45.121 --> 06:46.956
Oh, it's a lovely thought.
It's not that.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.692
It's just a...
Oh, you know me.

06:49.726 --> 06:51.728
I'm not really great
with living things.

06:52.729 --> 06:54.130
I think you are.

06:56.265 --> 06:57.700
Do you wanna make love?

06:57.734 --> 06:59.135
Please. Really.

07:01.871 --> 07:04.106
All right.
It's coming off
right now.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.474
Oh, dear.

07:08.878 --> 07:11.247
Oh. Oh, Steven.
Mmm.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.982
Did you see
this house?
No.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.250
Listen to this.

07:14.283 --> 07:16.586
"62-acre Vermont estate."

07:16.619 --> 07:17.854
STEVEN: Mmm.

07:17.887 --> 07:20.122
"Fruit orchard,
swimming pond,

07:20.156 --> 07:22.258
"360 degree view
of the mountains."

07:22.291 --> 07:24.627
This is so great.

07:26.295 --> 07:28.598
Why do you keep
saving those things?

07:28.631 --> 07:32.268
Why? A lot of people
have vacation homes.

07:32.301 --> 07:34.737
Yeah.
People who take vacations
have vacation homes.

07:34.771 --> 07:37.740
Well, you never know.

07:37.774 --> 07:40.610
I know you in Vermont
without a speakerphone
would not be a pretty sight.

07:40.643 --> 07:42.144
Oh. That is
extremely funny.

07:42.178 --> 07:43.613
Mmm-hmm.

07:43.646 --> 07:45.181
Oh, God,
it even has a barn.

07:47.183 --> 07:48.785
Do you wanna
make love?

07:49.786 --> 07:50.787
Do you?

07:55.324 --> 07:56.926
Oh. I guess
you do, huh?

08:16.813 --> 08:18.648
Mmm.

08:18.681 --> 08:20.216
Mmm.
That was incredible.

08:35.832 --> 08:37.232
STEVEN: Hello?

08:39.235 --> 08:40.837
One moment, please.

08:41.370 --> 08:43.072
J.C., it's for you.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.207
I'm in a meeting.
Take a message.

08:45.241 --> 08:46.208
J.C., it's the telephone.
Come on.

08:46.242 --> 08:47.343
What?

08:47.376 --> 08:48.945
It sounds
like overseas.

08:48.978 --> 08:49.846
Oh.

08:53.382 --> 08:54.583
Hello?

08:55.384 --> 08:56.719
Mmm-hmm.

08:57.253 --> 08:58.254
Yes.

08:58.988 --> 09:01.390
Cousin Andrew?

09:01.423 --> 09:03.960
No, I don't have
a cousin Andrew.

09:03.993 --> 09:06.362
Well, wait.
No, wait, wait, wait.

09:06.395 --> 09:09.231
My mother's cousin's
daughter's son.

09:09.265 --> 09:10.833
Yeah, you're right,
I do.

09:10.867 --> 09:11.968
Really?

09:12.001 --> 09:13.002
Oh.

09:14.003 --> 09:16.706
Well, hello?
Are you there?

09:16.739 --> 09:19.375
This is...
This is a very bad
connection.

09:19.408 --> 09:20.743
What happened?

09:21.744 --> 09:23.279
Oh, wow.
That's awful.

09:26.883 --> 09:28.985
I'm sorry. I really...
I'm terribly sorry.

09:29.018 --> 09:30.853
I still can't hear you.

09:30.887 --> 09:32.855
What about his will?

09:32.889 --> 09:34.724
No, no, no, no.
I heard that part.

09:34.757 --> 09:36.993
I just didn't hear
the part... Hello?

09:37.026 --> 09:38.728
Hello? I didn't
hear the part...
What's going on?

09:38.761 --> 09:40.262
Well...
Oh, my goodness.

09:40.296 --> 09:41.397
A cousin of mine died
with his wife

09:41.430 --> 09:43.399
in some sort
of an accident.

09:43.432 --> 09:45.267
I only met him once
when I was just
a little girl

09:45.301 --> 09:48.404
'cause he lived
in England,
but anyway,

09:48.437 --> 09:50.272
he left me something
because I'm his only
living relative.

09:50.306 --> 09:51.874
This could be big.
Was he rich?

09:51.908 --> 09:53.876
Oh, yeah, sure.
Of course he was rich.
My family?

09:53.910 --> 09:56.045
Hello. Yes.
Yes, I'm here.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.048
Uh-huh.
JFK tomorrow.

10:00.449 --> 10:01.784
Mrs. Atwood.

10:02.451 --> 10:03.920
All right.
What time?

10:05.922 --> 10:08.758
No, wait. Wait.
Excuse me.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.760
But I still didn't hear
what it was you said
he left me.

10:10.793 --> 10:12.328
Hello? Yes, hello?

10:13.796 --> 10:14.897
Can you believe this?

10:29.078 --> 10:31.948
WOMAN ON PA: Flight 701
now arriving from London
at Gate 29.

10:47.830 --> 10:49.065
Miss Wiatt?

10:49.098 --> 10:51.934
Oh. Yes.
Mrs. Atwood.

10:51.968 --> 10:54.070
Yes. British Department
of Health and Social Security.

10:54.103 --> 10:55.071
Shall we step
over there?

10:55.104 --> 10:56.372
Sure. Sure.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.475
I'm sorry
about Andrew.

10:59.508 --> 11:01.343
Oh, yes,
quite tragic.

11:01.377 --> 11:03.079
Of course,
I didn't know
them personally.

11:03.112 --> 11:05.481
Oh, no, I know.
Neither did I,
but it was very awful.

11:05.514 --> 11:08.484
I mean, you know,
what happened. So...

11:08.517 --> 11:11.954
Well, actually,
I have a lunch meeting
in 40 minutes,

11:11.988 --> 11:14.356
so if I could just sign
for whatever it is
that I inherited.

11:14.390 --> 11:16.492
Oh, yes. Certainly.
I just need you to
sign one thing.

11:16.525 --> 11:17.827
Mmm-hmm. Good.
There.

11:17.860 --> 11:20.396
So, what is it?
A million dollars?

11:20.997 --> 11:21.964
I beg your pardon?

11:23.866 --> 11:26.102
Oh. What is it?
I mean, what is it
that I inherited?

11:26.135 --> 11:28.004
Why, Elizabeth,
of course.

11:29.405 --> 11:31.373
What Elizabeth,
of course?

11:31.407 --> 11:33.142
Your cousin Andrew's
Elizabeth.

11:34.877 --> 11:36.512
Are you...

11:36.545 --> 11:38.380
Are you joking?

11:38.414 --> 11:40.116
Didn't Mrs. Simpson
tell you?

11:40.149 --> 11:41.150
What?

11:42.885 --> 11:44.420
What?
Wait a minute, now.

11:46.155 --> 11:48.858
I... Are you telling me
that I inherited a baby
from a cousin

11:48.891 --> 11:51.393
I haven't seen
since 1954?

11:51.427 --> 11:54.530
No. N-O.
No way. Uh-uh.
This is impossible.

11:54.563 --> 11:57.399
I'm sorry,
I assumed you understood
the nature of my trip.

11:57.433 --> 12:00.002
Well, you see,
that's the funny thing.
I can't have a baby,

12:00.036 --> 12:02.138
because I have
a 12:30 lunch meeting.

12:02.171 --> 12:04.140
I'm sorry,
I have to reboard.

12:04.173 --> 12:06.542
I'm on my way to visit
relatives in Florida.

12:06.575 --> 12:09.145
Now, Elizabeth,
this is your aunt J.C.

12:09.178 --> 12:10.546
The one I was
telling you about.

12:10.579 --> 12:12.148
You're going to
live with her now,

12:12.181 --> 12:13.883
and she is going
take care of you

12:13.916 --> 12:16.018
and love you
very much.

12:16.052 --> 12:17.920
Mrs. Atwood...
Here are her things.

12:18.921 --> 12:20.422
In there.
But I can't...

12:20.456 --> 12:22.424
And a copy
of the Wiatts' will.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.725
And Elizabeth's passport
and her birth certificate.

12:23.759 --> 12:25.427
Yeah, Mrs. Atwood,
I'm not the right sort
of person for this.

12:25.461 --> 12:28.164
You're the only person,
Miss Wiatt.

12:28.197 --> 12:30.166
She's a very
agreeable child,
you'll see.

12:30.199 --> 12:32.034
Once you get the hang
of it, I'm sure you'll be
a wonderful mother.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.210
Mother?

12:52.221 --> 12:53.822
Thank you so much.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.976
Armand. Yeah.
No, no, just get...
Yeah.

13:15.244 --> 13:16.946
Now, look,
careful, Armand.

13:16.979 --> 13:18.214
Her diaper's
just a little bit damp.
Oh.

13:19.515 --> 13:20.983
Gesundheit.

13:22.118 --> 13:23.085
What?
Would you mind?

13:23.119 --> 13:24.954
No, I don't mind.
What? Oh.

13:24.987 --> 13:27.489
Yeah. There.

13:27.523 --> 13:29.091
Do you have
anything to check?
Yes.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.493
No! No, no.
It's just for an hour.

13:31.527 --> 13:32.995
Just, you know,
take care of her.
She's very agreeable.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.249
Hughes. J.C. Wiatt.

13:53.282 --> 13:54.650
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you.

13:54.683 --> 13:57.119
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Thank you.

13:57.153 --> 13:58.554
Would you like
something to...

13:58.587 --> 14:01.523
Oh, I see,
you have something to drink.
Well, I think I'll join you.

14:01.557 --> 14:04.660
Waiter,
I'd like a glass of wine,
the same as Mr. Larrabee.

14:06.695 --> 14:10.132
So how long are you
in diapers for...
In town for?

14:10.166 --> 14:13.135
Just a day.
I can't take too much
of a good thing.

14:15.171 --> 14:17.273
That's very funny.

14:17.306 --> 14:20.009
I wanted to tell you
that I was just
so knocked out

14:20.042 --> 14:21.677
when Fritz told me
about your call.

14:21.710 --> 14:24.146
You see, I've always
been a very huge fan
of yours...

14:24.180 --> 14:26.048
Armand!
What is going on?

14:28.184 --> 14:30.152
Let me handle it.
I'll find out.

14:30.186 --> 14:31.920
Excuse me, Hughes.
Armand.

14:37.059 --> 14:39.295
Look, miss, miss.
I'm in the middle
of a major meeting.

14:39.328 --> 14:41.030
Could you please
keep her a little
quiet, okay?

14:41.063 --> 14:43.032
Look, if it's so easy,
you try.

14:43.065 --> 14:44.200
I don't know...

14:45.334 --> 14:47.036
There.
All she wanted was
her mama.

14:47.069 --> 14:50.172
I am not her mother,
and by the way,

14:50.206 --> 14:52.308
she has just been through
a very traumatic experience,

14:52.341 --> 14:55.077
so a little compassion
would not be out of line,
okay?

14:57.613 --> 15:00.082
I will give you
a very big tip.

15:03.219 --> 15:04.953
I'll give you
my Visa card.

15:10.092 --> 15:13.062
Can you believe somebody
would actually bring
a baby here?

15:13.095 --> 15:15.064
Anyway, as I was saying,

15:15.097 --> 15:17.733
I've always been intrigued
by the managerial panache
of The Food Chain.

15:17.766 --> 15:20.069
Tell me about you.

15:20.102 --> 15:21.337
Me, huh? Me.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.739
Well, I'm...
Oh, I just...

15:23.772 --> 15:27.076
I'm assigned all our
Fortune 100 companies.

15:27.109 --> 15:29.345
And I personally
handle IBM, Xerox,
DuPont, Polaroid...

15:29.378 --> 15:31.080
Excuse me.

15:31.113 --> 15:34.216
Yeah,
Texas Instruments...

15:34.250 --> 15:36.752
Yo!
What?

15:36.785 --> 15:38.354
Your baby has just barfed
all over my boss.

15:38.387 --> 15:41.090
But this is not
my baby.

15:41.123 --> 15:44.360
I... I went to
Harvard and Yale,
and I don't have children.

15:44.393 --> 15:46.762
She just... She's...

15:46.795 --> 15:48.764
She belongs... Look.
I'm gonna hold her
for just a minute.

15:48.797 --> 15:51.100
But this is not
going to affect me.

15:52.401 --> 15:54.236
Yes, I...
Who else do I handle?

15:54.270 --> 15:56.672
I also handle
Hewlett-Packard,

15:59.141 --> 16:02.278
Citicorp, Eastman Kodak,
they always ask for me.
They love me there.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.418
Oh, God.

16:10.286 --> 16:12.388
Oh. Luvs.
Here we go.

16:12.421 --> 16:16.525
Pampers.
Huggies Supertrim.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.795
Okay. Large, 23 pounds
and over.

16:19.828 --> 16:22.798
Hey. Medium, 20?
Twelve.

16:22.831 --> 16:24.666
Twelve to 24 pounds.

16:24.700 --> 16:27.136
And newborn is
up to 14 pounds.

16:27.169 --> 16:29.405
Okay, so,
you're not newborn,
are you?

16:29.438 --> 16:30.706
How much do you weigh,
anyway?

16:35.311 --> 16:36.812
Twenty-two.

16:36.845 --> 16:39.047
Oh, 22 pounds. Okay.

16:47.456 --> 16:48.324
Oh!

16:51.327 --> 16:52.328
There.

16:53.862 --> 16:55.063
Hi.

16:56.465 --> 16:57.333
Hi.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.068
Hi.
Hi.

17:02.738 --> 17:05.307
I need a drink.

17:05.340 --> 17:07.309
Okay. I'm leaving you here
for a few minutes,

17:07.343 --> 17:09.744
so I'm trusting you
not to touch anything.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.214
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

17:34.503 --> 17:35.504
J.C.?

17:40.242 --> 17:41.243
I'm home.

17:57.526 --> 17:59.495
Great hunting boots.
If I only hunted.

17:59.528 --> 18:00.629
Hi!

18:03.532 --> 18:05.367
Whoa!

18:06.402 --> 18:07.403
What?

18:09.671 --> 18:11.273
What is this?
A baby.

18:12.408 --> 18:13.909
What is it
doing here?

18:13.942 --> 18:16.912
J.C.: You know that pin
I thought I inherited
from my cousin?

18:16.945 --> 18:18.247
Yes.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.415
Well, it wasn't a pin.

18:24.286 --> 18:26.922
Ah, here it is.
"We hereby request
that J.C. Wiatt

18:26.955 --> 18:29.391
"act as guardian
to our only child,
Elizabeth Alice Wiatt."

18:29.425 --> 18:30.926
Mmm-hmm.

18:30.959 --> 18:33.262
"If however,
J.C. Wiatt is unable
to act as guardian,

18:33.295 --> 18:34.796
"we leave it
to her discretion

18:34.830 --> 18:36.398
"to find suitable
adoptive parents."

18:36.432 --> 18:38.934
Thank God,
you have an out clause.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.536
You do want
the out clause?

18:40.569 --> 18:43.272
Well, of course I want
the out clause.
What do you think?

18:43.305 --> 18:45.807
I thought I heard
your biological
clock ticking.

18:45.841 --> 18:48.277
Oh, Steven, please!
Please.

18:48.310 --> 18:49.545
Tomorrow I'm gonna
contact whoever it is

18:49.578 --> 18:51.280
who finds
suitable adoptive parents,

18:51.313 --> 18:53.682
but in the meantime,
we're just gonna make do.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.417
Here, would you
hold her?
Oh, no, no, no.

18:55.451 --> 18:57.286
I can't.
No, I never
held a baby.

18:57.319 --> 18:58.420
Oh, I see.
And what, I have?

18:58.454 --> 19:00.289
Oh, God.

19:00.322 --> 19:02.291
Thank you very much.

19:02.324 --> 19:04.293
Now look, there is
nothing in the world
to get uptight about.

19:04.326 --> 19:06.295
We are two
summa cum laude.

19:06.328 --> 19:08.330
We can handle
one little baby
for eight hours.

19:09.998 --> 19:11.467
J.C.: Mmm! Yum!

19:13.001 --> 19:14.870
Mmm-hmm.
Thank you very much.

19:19.608 --> 19:20.976
STEVEN:
It's linguine time.

19:21.009 --> 19:23.211
I think you're gonna
like this.

19:26.615 --> 19:28.350
J.C.: Here you go.

19:30.486 --> 19:31.620
Bon appetit!

19:54.376 --> 19:56.512
Great idea.
Give her linguine.
Wonderful.

20:01.049 --> 20:03.519
I think
it'd be easier
to just move.

20:04.052 --> 20:06.488
What are you doing?

20:06.522 --> 20:08.657
Spaghetti's dropping
from the ceiling.

20:16.532 --> 20:18.500
"Bring diaper between
baby's legs,

20:18.534 --> 20:21.670
"release tapes and
position over the front
of absorbent padding."

20:22.671 --> 20:24.540
Now...

20:25.407 --> 20:26.408
Oh.

20:31.079 --> 20:32.681
Release the tapes.

20:37.953 --> 20:39.521
There.

20:39.555 --> 20:42.290
Let's see.
In front of absorbent...

20:49.431 --> 20:50.966
This is really fabulous.

20:54.436 --> 20:56.672
Position over front
of absorbent padding.

20:56.705 --> 20:58.440
Okay, I've got it!

20:59.975 --> 21:01.076
Perfect!

21:27.869 --> 21:29.471
Ah.

21:42.150 --> 21:43.619
That's great.

21:46.755 --> 21:48.356
Yes, yes,
now the diaper.

21:49.024 --> 21:50.025
Okay.

21:54.496 --> 21:55.864
Sit.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.499
Yes. Now there, sit.

21:59.635 --> 22:00.736
Play with it, here,
you can play with this.

22:00.769 --> 22:03.138
Yes. You can play
with that.

22:03.171 --> 22:05.474
WOMAN ON TV:
Fine! You're doing
splendidly.

22:05.507 --> 22:07.042
Speed it up a little!

22:25.193 --> 22:26.628
MAN: A lot of 'em.

22:26.662 --> 22:27.763
There must be
30, 40...

22:27.796 --> 22:28.764
Twenty-six!

22:28.797 --> 22:29.665
Twenty-six.

22:39.207 --> 22:41.777
FEMALE TV ANNOUNCER:
Weinberger insisted he needs
everything he's asking for

22:41.810 --> 22:44.179
to negotiate
with the Soviets.

22:44.212 --> 22:47.182
Good opportunity to
go over the growing nature
of the Soviet threat.

22:47.215 --> 22:50.085
The reasons why
we have to have
the kinds of totals...

22:51.953 --> 22:54.523
Do you mind?
I'm trying...
J.C., please.

22:54.556 --> 22:56.057
Well, I don't know
what to do.

22:56.091 --> 22:57.659
All right,
I'll handle this.

22:57.693 --> 22:59.194
Stop crying. Please.
I'll pay you.

22:59.227 --> 23:01.429
Elizabeth,
now listen.

23:02.964 --> 23:06.067
It is 11:53, and it's time
for you to go to sleep.

23:06.101 --> 23:07.803
It's late,
we both have a lot
of work to do,

23:07.836 --> 23:09.805
and we need
some peace and quiet.

23:09.838 --> 23:11.206
Elizabeth, grow up.

23:11.239 --> 23:13.208
I have to be
at a conference
in Boston tomorrow,

23:13.241 --> 23:15.210
and I need
to concentrate, okay?

23:15.243 --> 23:18.547
Now, I want you
to lie down,
close your eyes

23:18.580 --> 23:21.683
and stop crying
by the time I count
to three.

23:21.717 --> 23:24.219
Don't shake your head
"no" at me, Elizabeth,
I'm speaking to you.

23:24.252 --> 23:25.721
Are you ready? One...

23:26.855 --> 23:27.856
Two...

23:28.990 --> 23:30.592
Two and a half...

23:30.859 --> 23:31.860
Three.

23:32.728 --> 23:33.829
It worked.

23:33.862 --> 23:35.564
Good.

23:35.597 --> 23:37.599
All right, now,
just kiss Uncle Steven
good night.

23:38.734 --> 23:41.236
Ow! Jesus! What?
She bit me!

23:47.275 --> 23:50.846
I hope this doesn't appear
like I'm a terrible person
for not keeping her.

23:50.879 --> 23:52.848
You forgot this page.

23:52.881 --> 23:56.585
Oh, thank you.
Thanks. Goodness.

23:56.618 --> 23:59.721
Anyway, her parents,
I never really knew them,

23:59.755 --> 24:02.123
and I'm not the motherly type,
I never have been.

24:02.157 --> 24:03.859
And I didn't have
little brothers
or sisters,

24:03.892 --> 24:05.994
so, you see,
I didn't babysit.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.730
Plus I'm not, well,
you know, I'm not
natural with kids.

24:08.764 --> 24:10.866
I'm a management...
I'm a management
consultant,

24:10.899 --> 24:14.135
and I work
12 to 14 hours a day,

24:14.169 --> 24:16.504
and I just really feel
that Elizabeth needs

24:17.305 --> 24:19.608
a more equipped situation.

24:19.641 --> 24:21.743
No explanations
are necessary,
Miss Wiatt.

24:21.777 --> 24:24.145
I'm sure we'll
have no problems
placing Elizabeth.

24:24.179 --> 24:25.881
You really shouldn't
feel guilty.

24:25.914 --> 24:28.617
You're not the first
person to put a child
up for adoption.

24:28.650 --> 24:31.887
Oh, I understand that,
and I'm really very
comfortable with my decision.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.521
And it's just...

24:35.190 --> 24:36.892
Guilt's not a part of it.

24:36.925 --> 24:39.761
Guilt's not a word
in my vocabulary.
I mean...

24:39.795 --> 24:40.929
Please, guilt?

24:46.802 --> 24:49.170
Believe me, J.C.,
you made the right choice.

24:49.204 --> 24:50.772
You're gonna be a partner,
for Christ's sake.
Uh-huh.

24:50.806 --> 24:52.774
Your career comes first.

24:52.808 --> 24:54.643
Look at it this way.
Yeah.

24:54.676 --> 24:55.644
You spend a few days
with her, you got her
all these toys.

24:55.677 --> 24:56.912
I know.

24:56.945 --> 24:58.313
$1,700 worth
of clothes.

24:58.346 --> 24:59.915
Come on,
that's not a bad haul
if you ask me.

24:59.948 --> 25:02.183
I just wanna say thank you
for your support, Jesus.

25:02.217 --> 25:03.785
Hey, no problem.
Nice to meet you.

25:03.819 --> 25:05.220
Nice to meet you.

25:35.383 --> 25:37.252
Put this over you
like that.

25:38.386 --> 25:39.821
And...

25:45.260 --> 25:46.728
Well... Gesundheit.

25:49.397 --> 25:50.999
What? You're hot?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.735
You're burning up.

25:54.402 --> 25:55.603
Uh-oh.

25:56.271 --> 25:58.273
What did I do
with that book?

26:00.275 --> 26:01.276
Oh, no.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.280
Sneezing. Let's see,
sneezing, sneezing.

26:06.414 --> 26:08.116
171.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.719
Don't get sick.
Just don't get sick.

26:10.752 --> 26:12.253
One cold-mist
humidifier,

26:12.287 --> 26:13.989
one electric
steam vaporizer,

26:14.022 --> 26:16.257
one baby thermometer,
one baby Tylenol,

26:16.291 --> 26:17.993
baby nose drops,
baby cough medicine,

26:18.026 --> 26:19.761
and...
A bottle of valium?

26:20.428 --> 26:22.030
Oh, yeah.
That's for me.

26:27.769 --> 26:28.770
Oh, I...

26:30.772 --> 26:33.875
Oh, I... All right.
I gotta take this.

26:35.443 --> 26:38.013
I know. I know.
It's gonna be so fast.

26:38.046 --> 26:40.048
I have to have this
before I do this.

26:44.920 --> 26:48.423
I know, Elizabeth,
it's gonna be
such a cinch, okay?

26:48.456 --> 26:50.291
Here we go.
Now try one more time.

26:50.325 --> 26:51.659
Here we go.

26:53.795 --> 26:54.796
Okay. Good.

28:23.151 --> 28:24.152
Hello?

28:26.421 --> 28:28.156
Oh. Oh.

28:29.557 --> 28:30.859
Oh, uh-huh.

28:30.892 --> 28:31.893
Yes.

28:33.161 --> 28:35.030
Yes, that's,
that's great.
Uh-huh.

28:36.164 --> 28:37.165
Uh-huh.

28:38.566 --> 28:40.168
10:00. Okay. All right.

28:41.903 --> 28:43.905
We'll...
We'll be there. Right.

29:05.193 --> 29:07.195
WOMAN: This is
Mr. And Mrs. White.

29:07.595 --> 29:10.031
Hi.

29:10.065 --> 29:12.300
The Whites have been
very anxious to
meet Elizabeth.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.035
Before we take her
off your hands,

29:14.069 --> 29:15.570
I wanna hear from
the horse's mouth

29:15.603 --> 29:18.306
that there's no chance
of us getting a male.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.042
WILMA: The agency
representative that came out
to our motor home

29:21.076 --> 29:23.311
said we might have
a chance of getting a boy.

29:23.344 --> 29:24.913
So Father here
just wants to make sure

29:24.946 --> 29:27.182
that no stone's
been left unturned.

29:27.215 --> 29:29.184
We did try to locate
a boy for you,

29:29.217 --> 29:32.187
but there are
no boys available
at this time.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.822
Well, then.
Is she all right
for you, Mother?

29:35.623 --> 29:37.058
Yes, sir.

29:37.092 --> 29:39.194
Now she's got
all of her shots
and everything?

29:39.227 --> 29:41.829
WILMA:
Lord, Merle.
It's not a puppy.

29:43.231 --> 29:46.201
I understand you bought
Elizabeth some new clothes?

29:46.234 --> 29:48.069
Oh, yes. I just... I bought
just a couple of things.

29:48.103 --> 29:50.471
See, she's just
getting over a cold,

29:50.505 --> 29:53.208
so I brought
her medicine, and...

29:53.241 --> 29:57.212
And, well, she takes
a quarter of a teaspoon
every 4 hours.

29:57.245 --> 30:00.081
And I packed
her measuring spoon in
with her clothes and toys.

30:00.115 --> 30:02.250
The clothes and toys
won't be necessary.

30:05.653 --> 30:07.088
Where are you folks from?

30:07.122 --> 30:09.490
I mean,
if I'm allowed to ask.

30:09.524 --> 30:12.227
We'll be moving
back to Duluth next week.

30:12.260 --> 30:15.096
Most of Merle's family
is out that way now,

30:15.130 --> 30:17.232
and our pastor
is out there and all.

30:17.265 --> 30:20.001
I'm sure Fern
will like it just fine.

30:20.668 --> 30:22.103
Fern?

30:23.671 --> 30:25.540
We're naming her
after Merle's mama.

30:27.008 --> 30:29.277
Oh, hush, hush.
Hush, now.

30:31.012 --> 30:32.647
Well, uh,
maybe I should...

30:32.680 --> 30:34.983
No. I'll take care
of the formalities from
here on, Miss Wiatt.

30:35.016 --> 30:37.252
You're free to go.

30:37.285 --> 30:38.253
Oh, I am.

30:38.286 --> 30:39.554
Oh, uh...

30:45.693 --> 30:46.894
Bye-bye.

30:47.695 --> 30:50.031
You... You take care.

30:56.037 --> 30:57.038
Right.

30:58.173 --> 30:59.174
Right.

31:34.342 --> 31:35.710
Just don't expect
too much, okay?

31:35.743 --> 31:36.944
Okay?

31:38.479 --> 31:39.614
Okay?

32:02.803 --> 32:04.105
I just couldn't
hand her over

32:04.139 --> 32:06.341
to a woman who called
her husband "sir."
It gave me the chills.

32:06.374 --> 32:08.609
Her whole life
flashed before me,
and suddenly I saw her

32:08.643 --> 32:10.611
in frosted lipstick,
wearing a Dairy Queen
uniform.

32:10.645 --> 32:12.080
Oh, look, J.C...
Anyway, Steven,

32:12.113 --> 32:14.082
I can handle it.
I really can.

32:14.115 --> 32:15.483
A lot of working women
do it.

32:15.516 --> 32:17.618
Eleanor Roosevelt,
Jane Pauley,
Ethel Kennedy.

32:17.652 --> 32:18.853
Ethel Kennedy?

32:18.886 --> 32:22.090
All right, so she
doesn't work, but
a lot of people do it.

32:22.123 --> 32:23.091
I just don't think
you know what
you're getting into.

32:23.124 --> 32:24.425
You have no experience.

32:24.459 --> 32:27.095
You kidding?
My mother had a doctorate
in parenting. You learn.

32:27.128 --> 32:28.229
I'm telling you,
you should see me
diaper now.

32:28.263 --> 32:30.765
I'm so totally
brilliant at it.

32:30.798 --> 32:33.101
I appreciate what you're
going through, I do.

32:33.134 --> 32:34.769
But for me, I just...

32:34.802 --> 32:36.771
Go ahead,
you can be honest.
I just...

32:36.804 --> 32:38.139
You what?

32:39.674 --> 32:41.008
I just...

32:45.280 --> 32:46.281
No?
I can't.

32:47.815 --> 32:49.016
Okay.

33:37.732 --> 33:39.434
MAN: My pleasure,
Mr. Sloane.

33:39.467 --> 33:41.169
Do we have
any women partners?

33:41.202 --> 33:43.304
Yeah. One.
In the Chicago office.

33:43.338 --> 33:45.173
Good morning,
Mr. Sloane.
Good morning.

33:45.206 --> 33:47.575
Oh, right, right.
The redhead.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.345
Everett, it's down here,
the first office
on the left.

33:59.220 --> 34:01.856
J.C.: I found it.
Here you go.
Here you go, miss.

34:01.889 --> 34:03.358
There it is.

34:03.891 --> 34:04.759
Oh!

34:05.360 --> 34:06.361
Oh, hello!

34:07.228 --> 34:09.464
Oh! Hello!

34:09.496 --> 34:11.199
FRITZ: Everett, you remember
J.C., don't you?

34:11.232 --> 34:13.201
Well, of course!
Everett, how do you do?

34:13.234 --> 34:15.203
I... I thought you were
in Washington.

34:15.235 --> 34:17.205
Well,
won't you please
come right on in?

34:17.237 --> 34:18.505
Yes. Sit down.

34:20.908 --> 34:22.510
Charlotte!

34:25.913 --> 34:28.216
Everett,
why don't you sit down?

34:28.248 --> 34:30.618
Oh, Everett, excuse me.
So, so sorry.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.219
If you could
just scoot over.
I'm terribly sorry.

34:32.253 --> 34:34.222
Oh!
Oh, my goodness!

34:34.255 --> 34:36.224
I have a hair dryer
in the closet.

34:36.257 --> 34:37.891
I'm fine, really.

34:37.925 --> 34:39.360
Perhaps a towel.
Would a towel be good?
I'm fine. I'm fine.

34:39.393 --> 34:41.362
Oh, very sorry
about that.

34:41.396 --> 34:42.897
When did she
have a baby?

34:42.929 --> 34:45.366
Oh, this isn't
J.C.'s baby,
it's her cousin's.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.235
She's just keeping her
for a few days.

34:47.268 --> 34:49.504
Yeah, well, Fritz,
as a matter of fact,
as it turns out,

34:49.536 --> 34:51.639
I'm keeping her...
Excuse me.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.641
I'm keeping her
a little longer
than that.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.243
How much longer?

34:55.275 --> 34:56.543
Oh, forever.

34:59.414 --> 35:00.915
Could I interest anybody
in anything to drink,

35:00.948 --> 35:03.284
uh, 7-UP, Perrier,
formula?

35:06.287 --> 35:08.289
I... I hear you'd like
to be a partner.

35:08.956 --> 35:10.925
Oh, yes.

35:10.958 --> 35:13.261
I would...
I would love
to be a partner.

35:13.294 --> 35:15.930
It represents
the kind of tenure
that... Pardon me.

35:15.963 --> 35:18.933
Yes. Thank you.
I'm so sorry, Everett.

35:18.966 --> 35:22.403
It represents
the kind of tenure
that I've always wanted.

35:22.437 --> 35:25.673
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

35:25.706 --> 35:29.277
So, anyway, it does...
Would you excuse us
for one moment?

35:29.310 --> 35:30.110
I'm very sorry.
Pardon me.

35:33.981 --> 35:36.183
Charlotte. Charlotte.

35:37.452 --> 35:38.953
Now, look here.

35:38.986 --> 35:41.956
This is the single most
important moment in
my entire career.

35:41.989 --> 35:44.425
If you don't stick this
bottle back in your mouth
this very second,

35:44.459 --> 35:47.295
you're gonna find yourself on
the next Greyhound to Duluth!
Do you understand?

35:47.328 --> 35:48.863
Okay, now, take it!

35:49.864 --> 35:50.965
Okay.

35:50.998 --> 35:52.300
Nice to see you again.

35:52.333 --> 35:53.834
You're leaving?
Yes.

35:53.868 --> 35:55.836
Because I wanted
to chat with you
about The Food Chain.

35:55.870 --> 35:57.438
I know they're looking
for new entries
in the food market.

35:57.472 --> 35:58.839
I have some
great ideas about...

35:58.873 --> 35:59.974
Good,
I hope they buy it.

36:00.007 --> 36:02.343
They will because
The Tiger Lady is
on the case.

36:02.477 --> 36:03.578
Mmm-hmm.

36:03.611 --> 36:05.580
Yes.

36:05.613 --> 36:08.316
I'm hiring a nanny tonight.
She'll never be
in the office again.

36:08.349 --> 36:10.585
Believe me,
nothing is going to change.
I'm totally on top of it.

36:10.618 --> 36:12.853
I need you to come with me
to Cleveland Thursday...
You got it.

36:12.887 --> 36:15.456
...to talk to
The Food Chain.
I'll be there. Absolutely.

36:15.490 --> 36:17.325
I can still count on you
seven days a week,

36:17.358 --> 36:18.859
48 hours a day?
Of course, I mean,

36:18.893 --> 36:20.461
I'm not gonna turn
into Erma Bombeck.

36:20.495 --> 36:22.363
I'm a maniac!
You know that.

36:23.364 --> 36:24.231
Yeah.

36:36.377 --> 36:38.879
Hi. I'm here
for the nanny interview.

36:38.913 --> 36:40.648
So why don't you tell me
a little about yourself?

36:42.049 --> 36:44.485
I'm originally
from Wichita, Kansas.

36:44.519 --> 36:46.521
Oh. And what brought
you to New York?

36:47.054 --> 36:48.356
The Lord.

36:48.389 --> 36:50.024
Uh-huh.

36:50.057 --> 36:52.627
Well, thank you very much
for coming by.

36:52.660 --> 36:55.496
I've just graduated
from Johns Hopkins,

36:55.530 --> 36:59.367
and I'm taking a year's
sabbatical before I begin
my medical school training.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.769
Fabulous!
And what brought you
to New York?

37:01.802 --> 37:05.506
I came here to
live with a guy,
but that didn't work out.

37:05.540 --> 37:08.042
And then three weeks ago
I suffered a nervous
breakdown.

37:08.075 --> 37:11.045
You see, my father,
he tried to commit suicide

37:11.078 --> 37:14.382
and when I came home
I found him at the bottom
of the stairs.

37:14.415 --> 37:16.417
My mother was drunk,
and she accused me of
trying to kill him.

37:19.687 --> 37:22.289
So what did you say
your baby's name was?

37:23.691 --> 37:25.660
I think you should
know from the start

37:25.693 --> 37:27.562
that I am
a full-charge nanny.

37:29.096 --> 37:30.431
I don't argue

37:31.432 --> 37:33.934
and I do not like
to be argued with.

37:33.968 --> 37:37.405
I will teach your daughter
to properly respect a man.

37:37.438 --> 37:39.407
I speak only
when spoken to.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.676
I do not need a bed,
I prefer to sleep
on the floor.

37:41.709 --> 37:44.545
Well, I don't have any
real nanny experience,

37:44.579 --> 37:46.947
but I love kids,

37:46.981 --> 37:49.417
and I did
a lot of babysitting
for people back home

37:49.450 --> 37:50.951
in Mandrake Falls...

37:50.985 --> 37:52.319
You're hired.

37:54.455 --> 37:56.557
Elizabeth...
Yes.

37:56.591 --> 37:58.459
I'm leaving
for Cleveland now.

37:59.126 --> 38:01.696
I will be back tonight,

38:01.729 --> 38:04.999
and tomorrow
we will spend
quality time together.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.569
Now, Eve,
your new babysitter,

38:08.603 --> 38:11.706
is a very responsible
person,

38:11.739 --> 38:16.010
and I feel
very comfortable
leaving you with her.

38:17.011 --> 38:20.448
I gotta go.
Uh, Eve! Good girl.

38:20.481 --> 38:22.717
Eve, now, you know
how to do everything,
right?

38:22.750 --> 38:25.586
Don't worry, Miss Wiatt.
Everything is under control.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.455
"Don't worry"?
Worry's my middle name.

38:27.488 --> 38:29.023
Really?
Well, no.

38:29.624 --> 38:31.459
No, no.

38:31.492 --> 38:33.728
Now, you have
my number at the office
and they can always reach me.

38:33.761 --> 38:36.464
Got it right here.
Good.

38:36.497 --> 38:38.599
And if you should
take her to the park,
I want you to be sure...

38:38.633 --> 38:41.135
I know. Take the mace.
This isn't Mandrake Falls.
Right.

38:41.168 --> 38:42.470
Very good.
Thank you, Eve.
Thank you.

38:42.503 --> 38:43.771
You're welcome.

38:53.648 --> 38:55.750
Everybody knows
that The Food Chain

38:55.783 --> 38:58.152
is one hell
of an organization.

38:58.185 --> 39:01.021
Your managers are effective,
your workers, motivated.

39:01.055 --> 39:04.492
According to your data,
your margins could be
the highest in the industry.

39:04.525 --> 39:06.761
Twenty percent growth,
equity returns
in the high 20s.

39:06.794 --> 39:09.630
So, what's the problem?

39:09.664 --> 39:13.033
Why isn't The Food Chain
number one in
the marketplace?

39:13.067 --> 39:15.035
Now that's the question
that's been keeping me
up at nights,

39:15.069 --> 39:17.905
and then I realized that
the answer is so simple...

39:17.938 --> 39:19.173
Miss Wiatt?
It's... Yes.

39:19.206 --> 39:20.508
Line two is for you.

39:20.541 --> 39:21.642
Well, I'm very sorry...

39:21.676 --> 39:23.511
They said
it was important.

39:23.544 --> 39:24.679
Well, excuse me.

39:30.217 --> 39:31.552
J.C. Wiatt.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.189
Eve...

39:35.222 --> 39:37.191
Eve, I'm in the middle
of a very important meeting.

39:37.224 --> 39:39.193
So what's going on?

39:39.226 --> 39:41.662
The nipples?

39:41.696 --> 39:44.665
Well, did you look
in the drawer to the right
of the sink?

39:44.699 --> 39:46.534
Why don't you do that?
Hurry up and while
you're at it,

39:46.567 --> 39:49.203
make sure they're
sterilized, okay?

39:49.236 --> 39:51.572
No, no, no. No, Eve.
Don't put her on, please.

39:52.573 --> 39:54.542
Hi. Honey,
yes, I hear you.

39:54.575 --> 39:55.810
Okay, okay.

39:55.843 --> 39:57.578
* The itsy-bitsy spider

39:58.245 --> 40:00.548
Good! Would you
put Eve back on?

40:00.581 --> 40:02.449
Eve, Eve, I gotta go.

40:06.587 --> 40:07.588
Oh, oh...

40:08.856 --> 40:10.457
Where was I?

40:18.866 --> 40:20.234
EVE: Oh, hi, Miss Wiatt.

40:20.267 --> 40:21.468
Hi, Eve.

40:22.603 --> 40:24.104
You got
a message today.

40:24.138 --> 40:26.106
Uh-huh.

40:26.140 --> 40:27.708
Mr. Curtis called,
and he said,

40:27.742 --> 40:29.844
"Congratulations.
You got the account."

40:29.877 --> 40:31.846
Well, thank you, Eve.

40:31.879 --> 40:33.748
Uh, what is going on?

40:36.617 --> 40:38.719
This is Wayne.
Dwayne.

40:38.753 --> 40:40.120
And we met
in the park today...

40:40.154 --> 40:41.856
Uh-huh.
...and he was
just leaving.

40:41.889 --> 40:43.157
Go with him.

40:44.892 --> 40:48.262
So, Helga,
tell me about yourself.

40:48.295 --> 40:50.731
How's your social life?
Would you say that
it's fairly active?

40:50.765 --> 40:52.266
I have no
outside interests,

40:52.299 --> 40:54.268
other than my sister
in Wiesbaden,

40:54.301 --> 40:56.270
and of course,
my music and my books.

40:56.303 --> 40:58.138
Oh, I see,
so then you're not
really involved.

40:58.172 --> 40:59.273
I mean,
you have no...

40:59.306 --> 41:01.008
Never have.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.611
Oh. So, Helga,

41:03.644 --> 41:05.746
now you're gonna
take her for a three-mile
walk every day?

41:05.780 --> 41:06.881
Are you sure that's not
too much air or anything?

41:06.914 --> 41:08.883
She will be fine.
Good.

41:08.916 --> 41:10.284
Now listen,
I've gotta run.

41:10.317 --> 41:11.118
I've got
an 8:00 appointment.

41:11.151 --> 41:12.887
So, I've gotta go.
Bye-bye, darling.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.655
Bye-bye.
Thank you, Helga.

41:28.335 --> 41:29.536
Helga!

41:30.671 --> 41:33.040
Helga!
Pardon me, Helga!

41:33.073 --> 41:35.776
Helga! Helga!
Helga, excuse me.

41:35.810 --> 41:37.778
I'm really sorry,
but I forgot,

41:37.812 --> 41:40.314
there's just one
very small detail.

41:40.347 --> 41:42.783
Could I have your
social security number
for tax reasons?

41:42.817 --> 41:46.821
Uh-huh.
126-42-4276.

41:47.955 --> 41:50.658
Great, and your
sister's name
in Wiesbaden,

41:50.691 --> 41:52.192
in case of an emergency,
and her prison record,
if any.

41:52.226 --> 41:53.794
Excuse me?

41:53.828 --> 41:56.697
Silly. I mean
her address,
if you have it.

42:03.838 --> 42:06.340
Good. I'll just write
that phonetically.
It doesn't even matter.

42:06.373 --> 42:08.676
Oh, jeez, I'm late.
I'll get it later.

42:08.709 --> 42:10.845
Oh, bye!
Bye-bye, Elizabeth!

42:11.712 --> 42:13.347
Bye-bye! Bye!

42:14.381 --> 42:15.683
Hey!

42:17.384 --> 42:19.954
I'm sorry.
Really, I'm quite fine.

42:19.987 --> 42:21.722
I'll see you
this evening!

42:31.732 --> 42:33.367
Charlotte, here.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.702
Take my coat,
will you, please?
Sure.

42:34.735 --> 42:36.871
Oh! Gotta hurry.
I know. I'm late. Okay.

42:38.005 --> 42:38.973
Meeting's started.

42:39.006 --> 42:40.274
Thank you.

42:42.409 --> 42:44.845
Oh, sorry.

42:44.879 --> 42:46.981
The problems of motherhood,
I had absolutely no idea.

42:47.014 --> 42:48.615
So, where are we?

42:49.750 --> 42:50.751
Uh, have you
seen this?

43:06.033 --> 43:08.402
Oh, J.C.,
we were just buzzing you.
Come in for a sec.

43:08.435 --> 43:09.303
Sure.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.775
Oh. Hi.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.878
Listen.
I have good news.
Uh-huh.

43:17.912 --> 43:19.313
I'm moving Kenny up.

43:20.047 --> 43:21.749
Oh!

43:21.782 --> 43:24.018
FRITZ:
I think after three years
under your tutelage,

43:24.051 --> 43:26.020
he's ready,
don't you think?

43:26.053 --> 43:28.756
Sure. Absolutely!

43:28.789 --> 43:32.893
FRITZ: Yeah, I want him
to be first lieutenant
on The Food Chain.

43:32.927 --> 43:36.030
Oh, you know, Fritz,
he's already been
helping me a lot.

43:36.063 --> 43:38.432
Yeah. I want you
to really involve him.

43:38.465 --> 43:40.434
Larrabee wants to push up
the deadline.

43:40.467 --> 43:42.069
I'll need you both
full-time.

43:42.937 --> 43:44.671
Oh, no, no, no.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.042
It's great.
I got plenty
for him to do.

43:48.075 --> 43:50.911
Thank you so much,
J.C., really.

43:50.945 --> 43:53.447
Uh, listen, I got...
I've got dinner with
Larrabee's people,

43:53.480 --> 43:54.949
so I gotta run.

43:56.817 --> 43:58.786
Oh, again, Fritz,
thank you for
this opportunity.

43:58.819 --> 44:01.055
That's all right.
Yeah, fine. Yeah.

44:01.088 --> 44:02.322
Just congratulations.

44:02.356 --> 44:04.358
Oh, thank you.
Really, thank you.

44:06.493 --> 44:07.694
Oh...

44:09.096 --> 44:12.466
You were smart
to recruit that kid.
He's good.

44:12.499 --> 44:15.102
Yeah, he's great.
He's really just great.

44:16.103 --> 44:17.337
CHARLOTTE:
Oh, there you are!

44:17.371 --> 44:19.073
You forgot
your Teddy Ruxpin.

44:19.106 --> 44:20.808
The Puffalump
didn't come in yet,
it's on order.

44:20.841 --> 44:21.942
Here you go.
The batteries
are in the box.

44:21.976 --> 44:23.077
Thank you very much,
Charlotte.

44:23.110 --> 44:25.846
Okay.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

44:26.513 --> 44:28.816
Good night.
Have a good weekend.

44:28.849 --> 44:29.649
Good night.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.955
Good night, Fritz.

44:34.989 --> 44:36.123
Good night.

44:55.542 --> 44:59.513
What about a week
from Wednesday
for junior symphony?

44:59.546 --> 45:02.382
No, no, no.
Cole has drama
on Wednesdays.

45:02.416 --> 45:06.386
Oh. Ben's got
his play group
in French on Monday.

45:06.420 --> 45:09.123
Gymboree on Tuesday,
computer readiness
on Thursday...

45:09.156 --> 45:10.524
What about Friday?

45:10.557 --> 45:11.992
After violin
but before his shrink?

45:12.026 --> 45:13.527
Perfect.

45:13.560 --> 45:15.762
Crosby, go play
in the sand box.
Here.

45:20.034 --> 45:22.402
What is wrong with you?
You look awful.

45:22.436 --> 45:23.904
We heard from Dalton.

45:25.572 --> 45:27.007
Crosby didn't get in.

45:27.041 --> 45:28.175
BOTH: Oh, no.

45:29.910 --> 45:31.778
I'm so upset.

45:34.181 --> 45:36.016
If she doesn't get
into the right preschool,

45:36.050 --> 45:37.551
she's not gonna get
into the right kindergarten.

45:37.584 --> 45:39.419
If she doesn't get into
the right kindergarten,

45:39.453 --> 45:41.021
I can forget about
a good prep school

45:41.055 --> 45:44.024
and any hope
of an Ivy League college.

45:44.058 --> 45:46.894
WOMAN: Honey,
that is so devastating.

45:46.927 --> 45:50.164
I just don't understand it.
Her resume was perfect.

45:50.197 --> 45:52.066
Her references
were impeccable.

45:52.933 --> 45:55.302
Dennis is gonna
kill me.

45:55.335 --> 45:59.173
Excuse me. I heard you
talking about preschools,

45:59.206 --> 46:01.575
and I was just wondering,
at what age do they
actually start?

46:01.608 --> 46:03.610
I forget.

46:03.643 --> 46:06.580
Well, it depends.
Two and a half, three.

46:06.613 --> 46:08.582
Oh, yeah.
And are the good schools,
are they hard to get into?

46:08.615 --> 46:11.919
Hard?
Are you kidding?

46:11.952 --> 46:13.921
I've had Alexis
registered

46:13.954 --> 46:16.924
at the Preschool
for Performing Arts
since birth.

46:16.957 --> 46:19.593
He's already
on the waiting list
for Dalton.

46:19.626 --> 46:21.929
So, if we're not on the
waiting list or something
by now, I mean, it's like...

46:21.962 --> 46:23.597
You can forget
about it, honey.

46:23.630 --> 46:25.599
Mom.
Hi, honey.

46:25.632 --> 46:28.635
Doesn't the sky
look just like Cezanne's
Bay of Marseilles?

46:32.506 --> 46:33.941
Gee, it does.

46:33.974 --> 46:36.210
Oh, Ben,
that is a terrific
observation.

46:36.243 --> 46:37.511
Go play, honey.

46:38.645 --> 46:42.482
They teach Cezanne
in preschool?

46:42.516 --> 46:45.485
Well, no, actually
Ben is a graduate
of The Center.

46:45.519 --> 46:47.221
Oh, that's an idea
for you.

46:47.254 --> 46:49.623
Really? The Center.
Now what is that?

46:49.656 --> 46:52.226
It's a week-long
intensive training program

46:52.259 --> 46:55.495
that literally teaches you
how to multiply your child's
intelligence.

46:55.529 --> 46:59.099
When we first went there,
Ben, he could barely speak.

46:59.133 --> 47:02.502
By the time we left,
he was reciting The Raven.

47:02.536 --> 47:04.972
What kind of classes
do you have your daughter
in now?

47:05.005 --> 47:06.006
Oh.

47:07.674 --> 47:09.243
None.

47:09.276 --> 47:11.011
WOMAN 1: Not even
a Mommy and Me?

47:11.678 --> 47:13.013
No.
WOMAN 2: Not Gymboree?

47:14.281 --> 47:15.649
WOMAN 3:
Not reading readiness?

47:15.682 --> 47:18.252
Nothing!
The child can't
even hold a cup.

47:18.285 --> 47:21.255
Ooh. The other babies
are way ahead of her.

47:21.288 --> 47:23.023
WOMAN 2: I thought
I had problems.

47:26.026 --> 47:28.528
MAN: Welcome
to The Center
for Brighter Babies.

47:28.562 --> 47:30.130
The point here,
moms and dads,

47:30.164 --> 47:33.133
is to teach
your children
the facts of life.

47:33.167 --> 47:36.136
Everything they
see and hear can be
stored and utilized.

47:36.170 --> 47:38.272
Please allow no more
than one second per
information card.

47:38.305 --> 47:40.040
You may begin.

47:42.709 --> 47:44.311
ALL:
Republic of Botswana.

47:46.713 --> 47:48.182
President Kennedy.

47:51.585 --> 47:52.919
Doorknob.

47:54.188 --> 47:55.189
BMW.

47:57.724 --> 48:00.294
Whoopi Goldberg.

48:00.327 --> 48:02.162
J.C.: Look,
I'm late for a meeting.
Just let me out here.

48:02.196 --> 48:04.164
I can run, okay?

48:04.198 --> 48:05.399
'Cause you guys
didn't come in.

48:05.432 --> 48:08.302
I asked you for
all the research that
I needed on Thursday.

48:08.335 --> 48:10.037
When was it?
When did I... Oh!

48:10.070 --> 48:11.938
Sorry. Whoa.
Very sorry.

48:12.739 --> 48:15.042
Where was I?

48:15.075 --> 48:17.444
* Wondering if the dreams
that I believed in

48:17.477 --> 48:19.079
* Can still come true

48:20.747 --> 48:26.453
* Caught in between,
it comes back to

48:26.486 --> 48:31.191
* You and me
ever-changing times

48:31.225 --> 48:34.228
* I gotta find me
a better understanding

48:36.630 --> 48:40.200
* Every day,
keep forgetting
what's mine

48:40.234 --> 48:43.337
* Gotta find me
a way less demanding

48:43.370 --> 48:44.638
Tchaikovsky.

48:45.772 --> 48:47.241
Great gray owl.

48:48.375 --> 48:49.376
Shrimp sushi.

48:51.245 --> 48:53.380
* All of our lives

48:55.782 --> 49:00.387
* And I had some big ideas

49:02.389 --> 49:06.360
* So much of my life
still not completed

49:06.393 --> 49:08.662
* Hopes and fears

49:10.397 --> 49:15.001
* Watching them change
into something new

49:16.803 --> 49:20.774
* Wondering if I'm going
to find the answer

49:20.807 --> 49:23.777
* Loving you

49:23.810 --> 49:29.783
* All of my life,
it comes back to

49:29.816 --> 49:34.388
* You and me
are running out of time

49:34.421 --> 49:38.158
* Gotta find me
a better understanding

49:39.826 --> 49:43.397
* Every day,
keep forgetting
what's mine

49:43.430 --> 49:47.033
* Gotta find me a way
less demanding

49:48.168 --> 49:50.304
* And we're holding on
so tight

49:51.438 --> 49:53.173
* Together

49:54.708 --> 49:59.179
* All of our lives

50:03.317 --> 50:05.419
KEN: If we convince
Larrabee that's a
rational thing to do,

50:05.452 --> 50:07.187
which it is, you know,
he's gonna go for it.

50:08.455 --> 50:10.424
Right. So you know
what you do?

50:10.457 --> 50:12.692
You put
a shark repellent
in the deal. Right.

50:12.726 --> 50:15.829
Hey, you know what, Rog?
Let me handle it,
okay? Thank you.

50:15.862 --> 50:17.731
Charlotte, can you
get me Elise, ASAP?
Thank you.

50:19.199 --> 50:20.434
J.C., uh...

50:22.202 --> 50:23.437
I thought you
were taking the
day off today.

50:23.470 --> 50:25.172
What brings you
back so early?

50:25.205 --> 50:26.706
Fate, I think.
Fate?

50:28.475 --> 50:30.177
We had
a breakfast meeting
in here this morning.

50:30.210 --> 50:32.846
Oh, you did?
Yeah. You have
so much more room.

50:32.879 --> 50:34.448
Big, isn't it?
Yeah.

50:34.481 --> 50:35.849
Hey, I'll be out
in just a second.

50:35.882 --> 50:38.752
Just, sorry. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

50:40.887 --> 50:42.589
Ken, do you know
anything about...

50:42.622 --> 50:44.491
Oh, Fritz. Hello.
Oh, you're here.

50:46.360 --> 50:49.329
Listen, Larrabee's
all over me about
that target list.

50:49.363 --> 50:50.464
Do you have any idea
when it'll be ready?

50:50.497 --> 50:52.332
Oh, I'm finishing it tonight

50:52.366 --> 50:53.867
and I'm gonna have it
on your desk first
thing in the morning.

50:53.900 --> 50:55.869
Yeah, okay.
Well, J.C., actually,

50:55.902 --> 50:58.338
I roughed out
a draft of it

50:58.372 --> 51:00.474
while you were
at that baby thing.

51:00.507 --> 51:02.742
Do you mind if I...

51:02.776 --> 51:05.345
No. No, not at all.

51:05.379 --> 51:07.481
It wasn't due
until tomorrow,

51:07.514 --> 51:10.484
but if you have it done,
I think that's great.

51:10.517 --> 51:12.118
Yeah.
Oh, terrific.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.222
Great, uh...

51:15.255 --> 51:16.256
Great.

51:20.794 --> 51:24.264
Hey. Ken,
this is my office.

51:26.266 --> 51:27.634
Yeah.
All right?

51:27.667 --> 51:29.135
Okay. Yeah.

51:30.937 --> 51:32.539
J.C. Wiatt.

51:36.943 --> 51:38.378
It's for you.

51:38.412 --> 51:39.813
KEN: Oh, great.
Thank you.

51:51.425 --> 51:52.826
ELIZABETH: Mama!

51:56.963 --> 51:59.533
Oh, I see.

51:59.566 --> 52:01.268
You took your
diaper off again,
didn't you?

52:01.301 --> 52:03.403
Huh, huh, huh?

52:04.971 --> 52:07.441
Oh, no. I hope
you're not catching
a cold again. Oh.

52:08.842 --> 52:10.544
You want to sleep
with me tonight?

52:10.577 --> 52:12.178
No? I sure could
use the company.

52:24.458 --> 52:27.427
Um, Mary, would you
have Robin see me as
soon as she gets in?

52:27.461 --> 52:29.829
Oh, she's already here.
They had an early meeting.

52:29.863 --> 52:30.664
Oh.

52:33.867 --> 52:36.436
ROBIN: Thank you very much.
Oh, Robin.

52:36.470 --> 52:38.972
Um, I need the flash report
in my office right away.

52:39.005 --> 52:42.208
Uh, Ken said that we're
going to pass on the
flash report from now on.

52:44.010 --> 52:46.212
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait a minute, now.

52:48.348 --> 52:49.849
Since when is Ken
calling the shots
around here?

52:49.883 --> 52:51.585
Ken.
KEN: Yeah.

52:51.618 --> 52:54.321
I asked Robin
for The Food Chain
flash report

52:54.354 --> 52:57.457
and apparently
you've made a decision
that I'm not aware of.

52:57.491 --> 52:59.993
Well, we talked about
this the other day.
I mean, their figures...

53:00.026 --> 53:02.329
Robin, will you excuse us
for one moment, please?
Sure.

53:02.362 --> 53:04.030
Thank you,
Robin.
Mmm-hmm.

53:04.063 --> 53:05.064
Their figures are
on track for the year.

53:05.098 --> 53:06.866
You know?
There aren't gonna
be any surprises,

53:06.900 --> 53:09.336
and we feel that it's
counterproductive so...

53:09.369 --> 53:12.005
The Food Chain
is my account,

53:12.038 --> 53:14.608
and I'm the person who's
gonna decide what is or what
is not counterproductive!

53:14.641 --> 53:16.876
J.C., you're overreacting.
I think you're taking
this personally.

53:16.910 --> 53:18.878
You bet I am.
I'm your superior
in this company,

53:18.912 --> 53:21.014
and I will not be
countermanded.

53:21.047 --> 53:23.617
Okay, whatever.
Don't walk away from me,
you little pisher.

53:23.650 --> 53:25.885
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be selling shirts
at Barney's, you know that?

53:25.919 --> 53:27.487
FRITZ: J.C.?

53:27.521 --> 53:28.522
Can I see you
for a minute?

53:30.056 --> 53:31.391
Of course.

53:37.063 --> 53:38.632
I'm sorry. I know
I went a little
over the top,

53:38.665 --> 53:40.367
but this guy's getting
out of control.

53:40.400 --> 53:43.036
I mean, I know
he's inexperienced
and I know he's young,

53:43.069 --> 53:45.505
but I just can't
use him on my team
anymore.

53:45.539 --> 53:47.040
Fritz, you're just gonna
have to pawn him off
on somebody else.

53:47.073 --> 53:48.908
Well, it's not that easy.

53:48.942 --> 53:51.378
Sure it is! Yes.
You can give him
to Joel or Ted.

53:51.411 --> 53:54.280
They can use him, but
I can't use him anymore.
J.C.! J.C.!

53:55.682 --> 53:57.684
I'm turning
The Food Chain
over to Ken.

53:58.084 --> 54:00.053
No.

54:00.086 --> 54:02.656
This account is
too important for us
to take any risks.

54:02.689 --> 54:04.524
Wait a minute.
I mean, I...

54:04.558 --> 54:06.660
We have this account
because of me!

54:06.693 --> 54:09.396
Yeah, I know that,
but you've changed,
J.C.

54:09.429 --> 54:11.431
I mean, you've lost
your concentration.

54:12.566 --> 54:15.068
I don't know.
You've gone soft.

54:15.101 --> 54:16.936
Fritz, a baby
came into my life

54:16.970 --> 54:18.672
and it's taken me
a few weeks to adjust,

54:18.705 --> 54:20.407
but I'm over the hump
and I'm back.

54:20.440 --> 54:23.076
Look, I need
a solid team
on this thing.

54:23.109 --> 54:26.079
And Larrabee feels
comfortable with Ken.

54:26.112 --> 54:28.948
Oh, I think
it's for the best.

54:28.982 --> 54:31.451
I'm putting you on
the Ferber dog chow
account.

54:33.987 --> 54:36.990
Oh. Oh, I see. I...

54:40.460 --> 54:42.562
I thought that
I was gonna be
a partner.

54:42.596 --> 54:43.730
That's
what I thought.

54:43.763 --> 54:45.699
Well, maybe next year,
after things have
cooled down.

54:45.732 --> 54:47.000
Uh-huh.

54:49.135 --> 54:52.572
Ah, swallow
your pride, J.C.

54:52.606 --> 54:57.110
Ferber's is a low-profile
account. You'll have more
time to spend with the baby.

54:57.143 --> 54:58.978
I told you,
you can't
have it all.

54:59.012 --> 55:00.747
Nobody can.
Not me,
not anybody.

55:02.749 --> 55:05.452
Look, I don't even know
how many grandchildren
I have, okay?

55:05.485 --> 55:07.721
But I've got this
company grossing
200 million a year!

55:07.754 --> 55:09.489
Well, something has
got to give!

55:14.494 --> 55:16.996
You've been
on the fast track
a long time, kiddo.

55:17.030 --> 55:19.499
It's okay to slow down.
Nobody's keeping score.

55:20.767 --> 55:23.136
Fritz, I can't
go out there now

55:23.169 --> 55:26.506
and say
that I'm working on the
Ferber dog chow account.

55:30.777 --> 55:33.647
Well, I guess you're
gonna have to do what
you have to do.

56:32.572 --> 56:33.707
Let's see...

56:37.577 --> 56:39.846
Okay. Okay.

56:43.850 --> 56:45.685
Hello?

56:45.719 --> 56:49.088
Yes, um, I'm calling
about the 62 acre
Vermont estate.

56:49.122 --> 56:51.558
I was wondering,
is it still for sale?

56:51.591 --> 56:53.827
Uh-huh.

56:53.860 --> 56:58.565
Honey, you know
that big car I
bought yesterday?

56:58.598 --> 57:00.233
Well, the reason
I bought it

57:00.266 --> 57:02.836
is because we're
gonna go and live
in the country.

57:02.869 --> 57:06.105
Yes, we are. Here, look.
See? See?

57:06.139 --> 57:08.842
Yes. This is
our house!

57:08.875 --> 57:10.844
Can you believe it?

57:10.877 --> 57:13.146
I just phoned the number
and I bought it.

57:14.280 --> 57:16.482
Honey, it's so exciting.

57:17.617 --> 57:19.853
We actually own a house

57:19.886 --> 57:24.858
with fruit orchards,
a pond and a barn.

57:24.891 --> 57:27.861
Oh, Elizabeth, it's
going to be a whole
new life for us.

57:27.894 --> 57:30.730
Yep. I'm going to relax
and sleep late.

57:30.764 --> 57:32.599
Bake apple pies,
get into quilts.

57:32.632 --> 57:34.133
I can't wait!

57:34.167 --> 57:36.636
We're gonna be just like
the farmer in the dell.

57:54.187 --> 57:56.289
Cow. Honey, look.

57:56.322 --> 57:58.291
Over there. Moo-cow.

57:58.324 --> 57:59.192
Moo-cow.

58:29.823 --> 58:31.324
New York plates.

58:31.357 --> 58:32.692
Uh-oh.

59:02.856 --> 59:05.358
Hi. Hi.
We're gonna go.

59:05.391 --> 59:06.592
Yeah.

59:45.765 --> 59:46.766
Oh!

59:48.768 --> 59:49.769
Dang it!

59:54.040 --> 59:56.009
Isn't this
just fabulous?

59:56.042 --> 59:57.877
I'm gonna rest
for just a second.

59:57.911 --> 01:00:00.413
I'm just a little bit
out of shape.

01:00:00.446 --> 01:00:03.750
This isn't
exactly the rowing
machine.

01:00:03.783 --> 01:00:06.886
Oh, no. The oars.
Oh, no. Oh, God,
I need those.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.421
No, don't...
Don't worry. Don't panic.
I can handle this.

01:00:08.454 --> 01:00:10.156
Everything's fine.

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:11.791
Help!

01:00:20.066 --> 01:00:22.769
I think that should be
enough for a pie.

01:00:22.802 --> 01:00:23.770
Pie.

01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:31.444
J.C.: And then the prince
kissed Sleeping Beauty.

01:00:31.477 --> 01:00:34.447
Then she woke up,
and she looked into
the prince's eyes.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.449
And you know what
she said? She said,

01:00:36.482 --> 01:00:38.317
"Thank you for
waking me, Prince,

01:00:38.351 --> 01:00:40.053
"because you
know what I did?

01:00:40.086 --> 01:00:43.056
"I overslept, and I have
medical school today.

01:00:43.089 --> 01:00:46.325
"And, you know, I'm going
to be a very important
doctor one day,

01:00:46.359 --> 01:00:48.461
"like all women can be."

01:00:48.494 --> 01:00:51.064
And then, you know
what they did?

01:00:51.097 --> 01:00:53.466
They made a date
to meet each other

01:00:53.499 --> 01:00:55.802
after her graduation.

01:00:55.835 --> 01:00:57.937
And you know what?

01:00:57.971 --> 01:00:59.472
It's a little bit
chilly in here.

01:00:59.505 --> 01:01:00.940
Let's go see what
the radiator's doing.

01:01:00.974 --> 01:01:03.342
Let's go see what
the radiator's doing.

01:01:03.376 --> 01:01:05.812
It's cold in here, huh?

01:01:05.845 --> 01:01:07.947
Huh? See, here we go. Here.

01:01:07.981 --> 01:01:08.982
Oh, no!

01:01:10.116 --> 01:01:11.384
Oh, no.

01:01:12.518 --> 01:01:14.954
Them pipes is
corroded, miss.

01:01:14.988 --> 01:01:16.823
There's no way I can
get this system
going again.

01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:19.492
Oh, that's a bad break.

01:01:19.525 --> 01:01:20.827
It's gonna be
a mighty cold
winter.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.095
Yeah? How
do you know?

01:01:22.128 --> 01:01:25.098
Well, you see
them birds?

01:01:25.131 --> 01:01:27.366
They're gully willows.
Oh.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.103
And when they're flapping
their wings like that,
means the big snow's coming.

01:01:30.136 --> 01:01:31.370
Right.
I better call the editor
of the newspaper.

01:01:31.404 --> 01:01:33.840
Now wait, Mr. Boone.

01:01:33.873 --> 01:01:34.974
Are you saying there's
no way of saving this
system?

01:01:35.008 --> 01:01:37.243
Uh, yup.

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:38.511
Do you know how much
it's gonna cost?

01:01:38.544 --> 01:01:40.980
Uh, nope.

01:01:41.014 --> 01:01:43.516
Uh-huh. Do you know
the ballpark?

01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:46.519
Well, we're talking somewhere
in the neighborhood of
$7,000, $8,000.

01:01:46.552 --> 01:01:48.387
What? Are you sure?

01:01:48.421 --> 01:01:49.989
Yup.

01:01:50.023 --> 01:01:53.526
Uh, Mr. Boone,
one more question.

01:01:53.559 --> 01:01:56.429
Um, are you the only
plumber in town?

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:58.898
Uh, yup.

01:02:28.194 --> 01:02:29.195
God!

01:02:36.469 --> 01:02:38.071
So, uh...

01:02:39.472 --> 01:02:40.907
How's the roof?

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.175
You've seen worse,
right?

01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:43.209
Uh, nope.

01:02:45.078 --> 01:02:46.913
Come on. What are you
saying? I need a whole
new roof?

01:02:46.946 --> 01:02:48.214
Uh, yup.

01:02:53.219 --> 01:02:54.187
J.C.: Hello?

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.488
Elise?

01:02:56.622 --> 01:02:58.925
Oh, hi!

01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:00.826
It's so good
to hear your voice.

01:03:01.627 --> 01:03:04.063
Oh, I'm fine.

01:03:04.097 --> 01:03:06.099
Really, I've
never been happier.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.202
Um, right now?

01:03:09.235 --> 01:03:11.971
Well, actually,
I'm making baby
applesauce.

01:03:12.972 --> 01:03:14.607
No, it's not from jars.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.943
No, it's from
real apples.

01:03:16.976 --> 01:03:18.945
I told you about
my orchards, right?

01:03:18.978 --> 01:03:23.082
Well, you see,
I invented this recipe
for Elizabeth,

01:03:23.116 --> 01:03:26.619
and, you know, I mean,
she really loves it,

01:03:26.652 --> 01:03:27.987
and, well, it...

01:03:29.655 --> 01:03:31.090
It gives me something
to do while it snows.

01:03:32.992 --> 01:03:35.494
So tell me,
what's going on
in New York?

01:03:35.528 --> 01:03:37.230
Oh, hectic. Oh.

01:03:37.263 --> 01:03:38.965
Right.

01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:41.100
You did!

01:03:41.134 --> 01:03:44.971
You mean
you got the big corner
office.

01:03:45.004 --> 01:03:47.106
We're talking about
the big, big one?

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.875
Oh, well.
I mean, congratulations.

01:03:50.276 --> 01:03:52.011
Oh, yeah.

01:03:52.545 --> 01:03:53.546
You did?

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.015
It was, huh?

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:00.987
Well, yeah.
Yeah, sounds like fun,

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.556
if you're into that
New York kind of
nightlife, sure.

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:07.893
Really? You did?

01:04:08.561 --> 01:04:09.562
Oh.

01:04:12.165 --> 01:04:13.899
Yeah. Where...
Where did you
meet him?

01:04:16.569 --> 01:04:21.140
* I'll never

01:04:21.174 --> 01:04:24.043
* Smile again

01:04:25.578 --> 01:04:30.183
* Until I smile at you

01:04:32.718 --> 01:04:36.155
* I'll never laugh again...

01:04:36.189 --> 01:04:38.324
Give me Waterman
in Atlantic Overseas.

01:04:43.729 --> 01:04:45.331
Pathetic.

01:04:49.068 --> 01:04:52.038
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
This is the Night Owl
on WHDY, Hadleyville,

01:04:52.071 --> 01:04:54.707
signing off and wishing you
a pleasant tomorrow.

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.310
And it's gonna be a nice one,
only 17 below.

01:04:57.343 --> 01:04:59.178
Enjoy it.

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.083
No!

01:05:05.084 --> 01:05:06.352
BOONE: Uh-oh.

01:05:09.622 --> 01:05:11.057
Your well's dried up.

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:13.592
Oh! Oh, God.
That's good.

01:05:13.626 --> 01:05:14.960
I thought it was
something serious.

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:17.330
We can just fill it up
because there's a hose
right around back.

01:05:17.363 --> 01:05:18.331
Do you know
what I mean?

01:05:21.767 --> 01:05:23.602
Fill it...
Fill it up?

01:05:23.636 --> 01:05:24.970
What?
Fill it up?

01:05:26.239 --> 01:05:29.742
Lady, you're...
You're out of water.

01:05:29.775 --> 01:05:33.079
You're out of water.
You're gonna have to
tap into the county line...

01:05:33.112 --> 01:05:35.614
...and that's three
miles down the road.

01:05:35.648 --> 01:05:38.751
Well, look, I am almost
out of money, Mr. Boone.

01:05:38.784 --> 01:05:40.219
I don't understand
these technicalities.

01:05:40.253 --> 01:05:42.221
Just tell me
one thing, okay?

01:05:42.255 --> 01:05:44.357
Is this going
to be expensive?

01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:46.359
Yup.

01:05:46.392 --> 01:05:49.228
Well, do you know, like
approximately how much
this is gonna cost me?

01:05:49.262 --> 01:05:50.363
Nope.
Nope, right. Yeah.

01:05:50.396 --> 01:05:52.231
Well, just guess!

01:05:52.265 --> 01:05:55.234
$5,000, $6,000,
maybe more.

01:05:55.268 --> 01:05:58.104
Oh, well, that's just fine.
That's it! I've had it!

01:05:58.137 --> 01:06:00.106
I can't make it
here, okay?
Okay.

01:06:00.139 --> 01:06:02.108
I mean, I am not...

01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:03.776
I am not Paul Bunyan,
all right?

01:06:03.809 --> 01:06:06.779
I went to Harvard.
I graduated at the top
of my class. For what?

01:06:06.812 --> 01:06:09.648
To spend my life
fixing up this
dilapidated shack?

01:06:09.682 --> 01:06:12.118
Well, you can
just forget it,

01:06:12.151 --> 01:06:14.387
because I'm gonna
get out of here.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.256
You see?
I need to work.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.392
I need people.
I need a social life.

01:06:19.425 --> 01:06:21.794
I need sex!

01:06:21.827 --> 01:06:24.130
Please! I'm
a married man!

01:06:24.163 --> 01:06:27.133
I'm gonna
shrivel up and
die here!

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:29.802
I mean, how
much baby food

01:06:29.835 --> 01:06:31.404
is a person supposed
to be able to make
in their lifetime?

01:06:31.437 --> 01:06:33.672
I mean, I am
a career woman.

01:06:33.706 --> 01:06:37.276
I'm used to having
phone lists and
dinner meetings.

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:38.811
Do you know
what I mean?

01:06:38.844 --> 01:06:40.279
Uh, nope.

01:06:42.715 --> 01:06:45.284
I have been "yupped"
and "noped" to death
by you guys!

01:06:45.318 --> 01:06:47.553
I have had it
with whiskers
and plaids!

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:51.824
Look at me.
I am going nuts!
I used to be cute!

01:06:51.857 --> 01:06:54.827
I am not prepared
for wells to run dry!

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.430
I just wanna turn on
the faucet and have water.

01:06:57.463 --> 01:07:00.299
I don't wanna know
where it's coming from!

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:03.302
Another 6,000!

01:07:03.336 --> 01:07:04.203
Oh!

01:07:11.877 --> 01:07:12.745
DR. COOPER: Hi.

01:07:13.879 --> 01:07:16.315
I'm Dr. Cooper.

01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:19.352
You passed out, and
Mr. Boone brought
you here to my office.

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.721
Hi.
You okay?

01:07:22.755 --> 01:07:24.490
Yeah. Where's the baby?

01:07:25.491 --> 01:07:26.859
Oh, she's fine.
She's with my nurse.

01:07:26.892 --> 01:07:28.727
J.C.: Oh. I fainted?

01:07:28.761 --> 01:07:29.762
Yeah.

01:07:30.763 --> 01:07:32.231
Really, I did?

01:07:33.366 --> 01:07:36.869
Oh. I never fainted
before, Doctor.

01:07:36.902 --> 01:07:39.872
Is there any chance
you might be expecting
Mrs. Wiatt?

01:07:39.905 --> 01:07:43.242
No. There's absolutely
no chance of that,
Doctor.

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.214
Zero chance of that.
Less than zero.

01:07:48.247 --> 01:07:50.783
Well, it's okay.
You can talk about
it, if you want.

01:07:51.917 --> 01:07:54.387
No, I can't.
Mmm-mmm.

01:07:56.389 --> 01:07:58.357
I can't
talk about it.

01:07:58.391 --> 01:08:01.227
Wait. Hang on. Here, here.

01:08:02.795 --> 01:08:04.230
Well, don't get
upset. It's okay.

01:08:04.263 --> 01:08:05.398
Oh, Doctor.

01:08:06.932 --> 01:08:10.503
You thought that I...
You thought that
I was pregnant?

01:08:10.536 --> 01:08:12.271
Well...
Fat chance.

01:08:13.539 --> 01:08:17.243
But, you see,
but that's not
why I'm crying.

01:08:17.276 --> 01:08:18.544
You know, because...

01:08:19.944 --> 01:08:21.546
I haven't had any...

01:08:23.816 --> 01:08:25.783
I haven't had any,
you know...

01:08:25.818 --> 01:08:27.520
Sex.
Hmm.

01:08:27.553 --> 01:08:29.388
I just can't even
hardly say the word.

01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:31.924
And it's not like I was
ever that into it,
you know?

01:08:31.957 --> 01:08:35.261
But when it's gone,
and you have no prospects
of it in the future,

01:08:35.294 --> 01:08:36.828
it's very upsetting.

01:08:37.563 --> 01:08:39.798
I...

01:08:39.832 --> 01:08:41.533
I hope you don't mind
my talking to you like
this at all.

01:08:41.567 --> 01:08:44.537
No, no, no.
Just... Just relax.
No?

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:46.805
I don't know
how to relax.

01:08:46.839 --> 01:08:48.541
It's not in my nature.

01:08:48.573 --> 01:08:51.310
You know, I mean,
I moved here, um,

01:08:53.446 --> 01:08:55.948
from New York,
foolishly thinking
that the country

01:08:55.981 --> 01:08:57.950
was gonna be
good for me, right?

01:08:57.983 --> 01:09:01.319
I thought that
I needed to slow down.

01:09:02.988 --> 01:09:04.323
I wanted to...

01:09:07.593 --> 01:09:09.862
I wanted to...
Um...

01:09:11.464 --> 01:09:16.301
I wanted to think
and I wanted to put
things into perspective,

01:09:16.335 --> 01:09:19.305
but now I just wanna
go home, Doctor.
I'm broke.

01:09:19.337 --> 01:09:22.441
I have nothing but this
200-year-old house that
I hate.

01:09:22.475 --> 01:09:23.475
I just...

01:09:26.612 --> 01:09:28.881
I'm so...

01:09:29.482 --> 01:09:31.584
I'm so lonely, Doctor.

01:09:31.617 --> 01:09:33.452
I'm so lonely!
It's okay.

01:09:35.354 --> 01:09:38.323
Uh, what is that?
What's that?

01:09:38.357 --> 01:09:39.992
That's
my next patient.

01:09:40.024 --> 01:09:41.859
What do you mean?
I'm a vet.

01:09:41.894 --> 01:09:43.595
Hi, Joe.

01:09:43.629 --> 01:09:45.331
You're a what?
Hi, Doc.

01:09:45.363 --> 01:09:46.599
I'm a veterinarian.

01:09:46.631 --> 01:09:48.867
I'm spilling
my guts out
to a vet?

01:09:48.901 --> 01:09:51.337
I'm lying on a vet's
table telling you
about my sex life?

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:54.340
Well, what do I have,
horse hair on me
anyway?

01:09:54.373 --> 01:09:56.875
I thought you knew.
Based on what?

01:09:56.909 --> 01:09:59.011
What? You're wearing
a white jacket. You
look like a real doctor.

01:09:59.044 --> 01:10:00.613
You've got diplomas
and a stethoscope.

01:10:02.381 --> 01:10:04.350
Relax, I wasn't
gonna put you
to sleep.

01:10:04.383 --> 01:10:06.619
Oh, what is that
supposed to be?
Vet humor or something?

01:10:06.652 --> 01:10:09.021
Look, Dr. Cooper,
I think it's highly
unethical of you

01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:11.890
to allow an obviously
emotionally unglued woman

01:10:11.924 --> 01:10:14.493
to sit here and think
that you're a real doctor!

01:10:14.527 --> 01:10:16.495
I mean, I think I should
report you to the AMA.

01:10:16.529 --> 01:10:18.631
Or the AVA.
Or the VMA.

01:10:18.664 --> 01:10:20.032
Or whatever.

01:10:21.534 --> 01:10:23.636
Oh! Now look,
may I please
have my coat

01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:24.770
before your next
patient eats it?

01:10:24.803 --> 01:10:26.505
Right.

01:10:26.539 --> 01:10:27.906
I am putting the
house up for sale.
Here. Here you are.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.375
I am moving back
to civilization.

01:10:29.408 --> 01:10:31.377
I'm gonna get myself
a nice little apartment,

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:33.546
watch HBO and have
a real life again.

01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:39.284
Oh!

01:10:49.828 --> 01:10:52.064
MAN: Reckon she'll be
able to sell the place?

01:10:52.097 --> 01:10:55.067
Not likely.
Place was for sale
for five years.

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.069
She was their
only nibble.

01:10:57.102 --> 01:10:58.270
Five years and I was
the only nibble?

01:10:58.303 --> 01:11:00.673
Meg, this is no good.
I mean, if I can't
sell the house,

01:11:00.706 --> 01:11:02.541
I can't afford
to move back to
New York.

01:11:02.575 --> 01:11:04.410
I know, honey.

01:11:04.443 --> 01:11:05.744
Well, we'll do
the best we can.

01:11:05.778 --> 01:11:08.714
No. Five years.
You say five years,
and I'm the only nibble?

01:11:14.119 --> 01:11:15.954
They're almost
too pretty to eat.

01:11:15.988 --> 01:11:18.090
I know. I got carried away
during the last storm.

01:11:18.123 --> 01:11:19.958
The twins loved
the last batch.

01:11:19.992 --> 01:11:21.427
And them kids
don't eat nothing
out of a jar.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.095
Oh, is that... Oh!

01:11:23.128 --> 01:11:25.097
What?

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:27.566
Oh, dear. I got some...
This aspirin is stuck
in my throat.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.835
Could I... Could I have
just a little piece of
bread

01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.437
or something?
Oh yeah. Certainly.

01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:32.971
Oh, my God!

01:11:33.005 --> 01:11:35.708
You should try this.
Oh.

01:11:35.741 --> 01:11:37.576
Oh.

01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:39.011
If I could just...

01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:42.715
Excuse me.
Hmm?

01:11:42.748 --> 01:11:44.850
Are you feeling
all right?

01:11:44.883 --> 01:11:47.486
I heard about
your collapse over
at the town meeting.

01:11:48.754 --> 01:11:51.724
Dr. Cooper's nurse
is also our mayor,
you know?

01:11:51.757 --> 01:11:53.592
No, I didn't know
that. Really?

01:11:53.626 --> 01:11:54.593
So, I'm the talk
of the town, huh?

01:11:54.627 --> 01:11:55.994
Well, so to speak.

01:11:56.028 --> 01:11:57.730
Well, that's very
comforting to hear.

01:11:57.763 --> 01:12:00.132
Let me tell you.
Listen, um, Sam,

01:12:00.165 --> 01:12:02.134
I could use
a few things.
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:04.136
I need a half
gallon of milk,

01:12:04.169 --> 01:12:05.404
two bottles
of apple juice,

01:12:05.438 --> 01:12:07.005
a box of
Hamburger Helper

01:12:07.039 --> 01:12:10.509
and two dozen cans
of that kerosene.

01:12:12.778 --> 01:12:16.482
Yeah, I'm working
on a small project
at home.

01:12:19.184 --> 01:12:21.019
I wanna get back
to the pottery place
before it closes.

01:12:21.053 --> 01:12:22.621
Isn't this place cute?

01:12:22.655 --> 01:12:24.022
The whole state is cute.

01:12:24.056 --> 01:12:26.024
Phil, did you lock the car?
The video camera is in there.

01:12:26.058 --> 01:12:27.760
Yes, honey. I locked it.
I locked it.

01:12:27.793 --> 01:12:29.161
Hey, do we have
enough maple syrup
or should we get more?

01:12:29.194 --> 01:12:30.496
Better get
a couple more.

01:12:30.529 --> 01:12:34.032
Oh, honey, look at
these for Lindsay.

01:12:34.066 --> 01:12:35.167
Those are great.
Isn't that adorable?

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.769
Oh, look at this.

01:12:36.802 --> 01:12:38.771
Does this look
good on me?

01:12:38.804 --> 01:12:40.639
Well, what are
you going for?

01:12:40.673 --> 01:12:43.776
I don't know.
Turtleneck, Sundays
reading the paper.

01:12:43.809 --> 01:12:44.910
What? No good?

01:12:44.943 --> 01:12:46.645
Well, they're $12!

01:12:46.679 --> 01:12:49.181
You don't need a $12 shirt.
Get a Ralph Lauren.

01:12:49.214 --> 01:12:51.517
Gail! Look at this!

01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:53.519
Gourmet baby food!

01:12:53.552 --> 01:12:55.053
I've never
seen this before!

01:12:55.087 --> 01:12:58.056
Fabulous idea!
How much are they?

01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:00.659
Oh, they're $3.50 a jar.
Cheap!

01:13:00.693 --> 01:13:03.195
Well, $4.50, I mean
they're $5.50. They're
$5.50 a jar.

01:13:03.228 --> 01:13:04.797
Oh, great packaging
concept!
Really.

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:06.198
This is very unique.

01:13:06.231 --> 01:13:08.534
That means the way
it's designed.

01:13:08.567 --> 01:13:11.537
Oh, really! Isn't that
something? You learn something
new every day, don't you?

01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:14.206
We'll take a dozen.
And how are you?

01:13:14.239 --> 01:13:16.809
You cute little
country baby!

01:13:16.842 --> 01:13:18.677
We'll take
a dozen, too.

01:13:18.711 --> 01:13:20.212
I can't believe
nobody's come up
with this before.

01:13:20.245 --> 01:13:22.681
Gourmet baby food!
Fabulous idea.

01:13:22.715 --> 01:13:24.683
Great
Christmas gift!
It is.

01:13:24.717 --> 01:13:27.085
Great.

01:13:27.119 --> 01:13:30.222
Well, God,
it's the greatest Christmas
present. Uh, it is.

01:13:30.255 --> 01:13:32.558
Yeah.
Honey, maybe we ought
to even get more.

01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:33.559
We should.
We, too.

01:13:33.592 --> 01:13:34.593
Yeah.

01:13:37.863 --> 01:13:39.832
I'd like to see
everything you have
on baby boomers,

01:13:39.865 --> 01:13:43.101
new consumerism,
baby food manufacturers.

01:13:43.135 --> 01:13:46.605
Also recent issues
of Progressive Grocer
and American Demographics.

01:14:23.308 --> 01:14:25.277
Uh, look, I know
we saw each other,

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:27.746
so it'd be kind of stupid
for me to ignore you, right?
Oh.

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.882
No. No, really. It
wouldn't. Go ahead,
please. Ignore me.

01:14:29.915 --> 01:14:31.750
You have my permission.

01:14:31.784 --> 01:14:33.886
Yeah.

01:14:33.919 --> 01:14:36.889
There's something about
you that's kind of hard
to ignore, you know.

01:14:38.323 --> 01:14:39.658
Uh-huh.

01:14:41.326 --> 01:14:42.294
What are you
doing here anyway?

01:14:42.327 --> 01:14:44.162
Well, I'm just doing
a little bit of research.

01:14:44.196 --> 01:14:44.997
Oh.

01:14:46.665 --> 01:14:48.033
Oh, can I help you?
No, no, you can't.

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:49.067
Really. You cannot.

01:14:52.671 --> 01:14:55.908
What are you doing here?
I thought you were a vet.

01:14:55.941 --> 01:14:57.209
Hi, Dr. Cooper.
Hi, Stacey.

01:14:58.677 --> 01:15:00.545
No, I teach a class
here once a week.

01:15:04.817 --> 01:15:07.786
Uh, aren't you supposed
to be headed back
to civilization?

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.688
Oh, I'm working on it.
Believe me.

01:15:15.227 --> 01:15:16.795
What?

01:15:16.829 --> 01:15:17.796
Uh, nothing,
I was just wondering

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:20.699
if maybe you wanted
to go have a cup
of coffee.

01:15:21.834 --> 01:15:23.335
I don't drink coffee.

01:15:23.368 --> 01:15:25.337
Okay...
Anyway, I thought that
you asked in a way

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:27.339
that just sort of sounded
to me like you weren't
even asking,

01:15:27.372 --> 01:15:29.708
so I just think, you know,
"Forget it." Just forget...

01:15:32.978 --> 01:15:35.347
I can't believe this.

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.816
Um, are you this
nervous around
all men,

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:39.251
or is it just me?

01:16:02.007 --> 01:16:03.275
Oh, no.

01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:09.381
"Place the
jack tongue..."

01:16:09.414 --> 01:16:11.717
Oh, God.

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:13.251
"...in the slot
in the bumper."

01:16:13.285 --> 01:16:15.387
Okay. Okay.

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.990
All right.
I've got this bumper.

01:16:18.023 --> 01:16:21.393
I'm positioning this
tongue in this slot.

01:16:23.762 --> 01:16:24.763
Oh.

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:33.138
You need some help?

01:16:33.171 --> 01:16:35.774
Everything is under
control. Thank you
very much.

01:16:39.044 --> 01:16:41.747
Here, here. Let me...
No, I've got it.
I've got it fine.

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.648
It's gotta go
in the slot.

01:16:44.783 --> 01:16:46.018
Oh.
There you go.

01:16:46.051 --> 01:16:48.420
Yes, I guess
I'm just...

01:16:48.453 --> 01:16:51.156
I guess I'm just not used
to this kind of jack,
that's all.

01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:52.424
Right.

01:16:54.927 --> 01:16:57.029
You know, uh,

01:16:57.062 --> 01:16:59.898
you kind of remind me
of a bull terrier
sometimes.

01:16:59.932 --> 01:17:02.434
Yeah. I bet you say
that to all the girls.

01:17:02.467 --> 01:17:06.671
You do. I mean,
you're feisty
and quarrelsome

01:17:07.806 --> 01:17:09.775
and hard to get
along with.

01:17:09.808 --> 01:17:12.044
You know, even a bull
terrier, once they
warm up to you, they...

01:17:12.077 --> 01:17:13.912
They what?

01:17:13.946 --> 01:17:16.048
They bring you
your slippers?

01:17:16.081 --> 01:17:19.451
There.
You got it.

01:17:19.484 --> 01:17:24.089
Now, I'm just going
to loosen the lug nuts.

01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:29.461
These are...
The lug nuts
are right there.

01:17:29.494 --> 01:17:30.963
Oh, yeah.
I knew that.

01:17:34.232 --> 01:17:37.335
Look, is there something
I've done to you that
I don't know about?

01:17:37.369 --> 01:17:39.071
Right. Right.

01:17:39.104 --> 01:17:42.474
You don't know that
I've been completely
humiliated?

01:17:42.507 --> 01:17:44.977
Why? Because you told me
you hadn't had sex
for over a year?

01:17:46.111 --> 01:17:48.480
It has not been
over a year.

01:17:48.513 --> 01:17:50.816
Where did you hear
it was over a year?
At the town meeting?

01:17:50.849 --> 01:17:51.817
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:53.952
I'm...
I'm not ashamed.

01:17:53.986 --> 01:17:57.489
I just really choose
not to talk about this
any further.

01:17:57.522 --> 01:17:58.957
There!

01:17:58.991 --> 01:18:01.827
If a man knows
your frailties,

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.829
it doesn't necessarily
mean that he's your
enemy, you know.

01:18:03.862 --> 01:18:06.398
I mean,
I like frailties.
I like women.

01:18:07.866 --> 01:18:09.001
So, you're under
control here?
Yes, I'm fine.

01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:15.841
You know, you and me
are probably the only
two people under 60

01:18:15.874 --> 01:18:17.509
in the whole
of Hadleyville County,

01:18:17.542 --> 01:18:19.511
so we might as well
make the best of it.

01:18:19.544 --> 01:18:23.515
Look, I appreciate you
taking the time to chat,

01:18:23.548 --> 01:18:25.984
but I'm really not
in the mood for
idle conversation.

01:18:26.018 --> 01:18:28.120
So, if it should
happen again, I think
we should both

01:18:28.153 --> 01:18:30.122
gracefully try to
ignore each other.

01:18:30.155 --> 01:18:31.990
'Cause I'm not one
of your little students

01:18:32.024 --> 01:18:34.993
who's gonna faint
every time you say
"hello."

01:18:35.027 --> 01:18:38.530
I am a tough,
cold career woman

01:18:38.563 --> 01:18:40.532
who has absolutely
nothing in common

01:18:40.565 --> 01:18:43.135
with a veterinarian
from Hadleyville.

01:18:43.168 --> 01:18:45.403
I have only one thing
on my mind at this point
in my life,

01:18:45.437 --> 01:18:47.539
and that is to get out
of this moth-eaten town.

01:18:47.572 --> 01:18:49.908
And nothing here,
including you,
Dr. Charm,

01:18:51.176 --> 01:18:53.912
holds any interest
for me whatsoever.

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.782
So what do you think
about that?

01:19:14.199 --> 01:19:15.800
See you around.

01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:25.210
Wow.

01:19:53.638 --> 01:19:55.607
We don't sell baby food.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.075
That's perfectly fine,
because this is unlike

01:19:57.109 --> 01:19:58.210
any baby food
you've ever tasted.

01:19:58.243 --> 01:20:00.078
It's all natural.
It's homemade.

01:20:00.112 --> 01:20:02.981
We don't sell baby food.

01:20:03.648 --> 01:20:04.849
Right.

01:20:14.659 --> 01:20:16.962
J.C.: Now, ladies,
I'm telling you honestly.

01:20:16.995 --> 01:20:19.097
Trust me.
You can trust me.
I swear to you.

01:20:19.131 --> 01:20:20.632
This is the
greatest stuff ever.

01:20:20.665 --> 01:20:22.968
Honest. Really.
Were you gonna
try it?

01:20:23.001 --> 01:20:25.237
Look. I'm gonna show you
something now you're not
going to believe.

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:27.973
Here you go.
Here you go.
Here you go.

01:20:28.006 --> 01:20:29.975
You want this?
You wanna take it?

01:20:30.008 --> 01:20:32.244
Put it in your mouth.
Are you going to...

01:20:34.679 --> 01:20:36.982
I like it!
I love it.

01:21:03.708 --> 01:21:05.177
So, now let me
get this straight.

01:21:05.210 --> 01:21:08.546
You want the Country Baby
peas, peas and carrots,
the corn and the bananas?

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.015
Oh, and listen,
why don't I send you
our catalogue?

01:21:10.048 --> 01:21:11.916
Great. Super.
Okay. Bye.

01:21:19.591 --> 01:21:21.326
J.C.: Elizabeth,
that's great!

01:21:32.337 --> 01:21:33.605
Morning, J.C.
Morning!

01:21:38.743 --> 01:21:40.445
We'll send that
right over, Mayor.

01:21:40.478 --> 01:21:42.314
Thanks, Mary.
I'll see you
tomorrow.

01:21:42.347 --> 01:21:46.051
Oh, excuse me, Mayor?
Aren't you Dr. Cooper's
nurse?

01:21:46.084 --> 01:21:48.320
Yes, I am.
Oh, how are
you feeling?

01:21:48.353 --> 01:21:50.055
Oh, I'm fine.
How's Dr. Cooper?

01:21:50.088 --> 01:21:51.589
Oh, he's fine.

01:21:51.623 --> 01:21:54.192
Oh, good. I'm glad
to hear that.

01:21:54.226 --> 01:21:56.461
You know, I was
thinking about him
the other day,

01:21:56.494 --> 01:22:00.332
and it's just
very good to hear
that he's pretty fine.

01:22:00.365 --> 01:22:03.201
Well, he had a pretty
bad cold, but he's
much better now.

01:22:03.235 --> 01:22:05.203
Oh.
Just has a bit
of a cough.

01:22:05.237 --> 01:22:07.339
Well, tell him I said
"hi." No, forget it.
Never mind.

01:22:07.372 --> 01:22:09.341
He'll just think...

01:22:09.374 --> 01:22:11.343
Oh, my goodness.
Well...

01:22:11.376 --> 01:22:12.744
See you later,
Doctor.

01:22:12.777 --> 01:22:15.213
Hi.

01:22:15.247 --> 01:22:17.349
Oh, are you taking
something for that,
uh...

01:22:17.382 --> 01:22:19.751
Oh, yeah, I think
I've got it under
control.

01:22:19.784 --> 01:22:21.253
That's
good. I'm glad to
hear that.

01:22:22.787 --> 01:22:24.256
Yeah.

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:27.625
So, I hear your...
So?

01:22:27.659 --> 01:22:29.094
...business is
really taking off.

01:22:29.127 --> 01:22:30.762
Isn't that something?
It's unbelievable.

01:22:30.795 --> 01:22:33.098
Yeah.
We have our products
in a catalogue.

01:22:33.131 --> 01:22:35.233
Do you?
Yes, and I'm
doing very good.

01:22:35.267 --> 01:22:37.635
That's good.
Yeah.

01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:40.772
Are you still moving
back to New York?

01:22:40.805 --> 01:22:42.774
Oh, yeah.
First chance I get.

01:22:42.807 --> 01:22:44.142
Hmm.

01:22:44.676 --> 01:22:46.111
Huh.
Huh.

01:22:46.144 --> 01:22:47.779
Um, yeah...

01:22:47.812 --> 01:22:49.381
Well, it's good
to see you.

01:22:49.414 --> 01:22:51.249
Oh, isn't
that something?

01:22:51.283 --> 01:22:53.017
It's good
to see you, too.

01:22:56.288 --> 01:22:58.123
Take care.
Um, yeah.

01:22:58.156 --> 01:22:59.691
Yeah. Take care.

01:23:14.172 --> 01:23:15.407
J.C.: There it goes!
MAN: Look at that.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.176
Yeah, you're big time now.
Great! It looks
good! I love it!

01:24:56.408 --> 01:24:58.910
J.C. J.C., hi.

01:24:58.943 --> 01:24:59.911
Oh, hi.
How are you?

01:24:59.944 --> 01:25:01.913
I'm good. I'm good.
This is Ben.

01:25:01.946 --> 01:25:04.516
I knew it was Ben.
I knew it.
Yeah.

01:25:04.549 --> 01:25:06.518
Hi, Annie. Hi.

01:25:06.551 --> 01:25:09.387
You see Elizabeth?
Doesn't she look
cute tonight?

01:25:09.421 --> 01:25:11.155
You wanna dance, huh?

01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:15.827
Hello. And how are you?

01:25:16.961 --> 01:25:19.564
Oh, Emily, hello.
How are you?

01:25:25.303 --> 01:25:26.304
Hi.

01:25:35.447 --> 01:25:37.815
I didn't know you were
a music aficionado.

01:25:37.849 --> 01:25:40.952
Oh. No, I never miss
a concert my plumber
plays in.

01:25:40.985 --> 01:25:41.953
Oh, he's pretty good,
isn't he?

01:25:41.986 --> 01:25:44.422
Yeah, he's very
good. Yeah.

01:25:44.456 --> 01:25:46.958
Oh, so this is the famous
"Country Baby" baby?

01:25:46.991 --> 01:25:49.561
I know. What do
you think? This
is Elizabeth.

01:25:49.594 --> 01:25:52.430
Hi.
Hi. Hi.

01:25:53.598 --> 01:25:55.300
I know.

01:25:55.333 --> 01:25:57.302
Well, you look good.

01:25:57.335 --> 01:25:59.971
Thanks. So do you.

01:26:00.004 --> 01:26:01.839
Um, I like your shirt.

01:26:01.873 --> 01:26:04.442
Do you?
Yes.

01:26:04.476 --> 01:26:06.844
Listen, you want to know
how... You don't drink
coffee, do you?

01:26:06.878 --> 01:26:08.846
Oh, but I drink
lots of other things.
You do?

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.317
Yeah, 7UP
and root beer,
iced tea and water.

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:14.586
You do?
I drink punch.

01:26:14.619 --> 01:26:15.987
Punch!

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.355
Well, let's have
some punch.

01:26:41.646 --> 01:26:44.349
Oh!
It spilled.

01:26:44.382 --> 01:26:45.517
Oh, no.

01:27:05.403 --> 01:27:08.373
We're gonna slow things
down now a bit, folks.

01:27:08.406 --> 01:27:11.042
So if you wanna take hold
of your favorite partner,

01:27:11.075 --> 01:27:12.910
now would be
a good time.

01:27:12.944 --> 01:27:14.412
One, two, three.

01:27:15.813 --> 01:27:19.951
* Pennies in a stream

01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:26.424
* Falling leaves,
a sycamore

01:27:27.692 --> 01:27:31.663
* Moonlight in Vermont...

01:27:31.696 --> 01:27:33.398
Do you wanna dance?

01:27:33.431 --> 01:27:34.666
Would you like
to dance?
Oh, I would.

01:27:34.699 --> 01:27:35.900
I'd love to dance.
You would?

01:27:35.933 --> 01:27:38.670
I don't exactly know
what I'm gonna do
with chatterbox...

01:27:38.703 --> 01:27:41.406
I'll hold her.
I'll hold her.
Will you really? Thanks.

01:27:41.439 --> 01:27:43.975
Okay, I'll be back.
I'll be back.

01:27:44.976 --> 01:27:46.678
Oh, quick.
Okay.

01:27:46.711 --> 01:27:48.680
Oh, by the way, I...

01:27:48.713 --> 01:27:51.416
I don't really
slow dance
all that well.

01:27:51.449 --> 01:27:54.552
So, you gonna still do this?

01:27:54.586 --> 01:27:56.320
DR. COOPER: Come on.
Come on. Let's give
it a whirl.

01:29:00.652 --> 01:29:02.153
Hey. Is she asleep?

01:29:02.186 --> 01:29:03.655
Oh, yeah.
She's really out.

01:29:06.791 --> 01:29:09.761
Um, I think I have
a bottle of wine
in here somewhere.

01:29:09.794 --> 01:29:11.028
You do?
Yeah.

01:29:11.062 --> 01:29:12.530
A short house.
Oh.

01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:15.399
It's in the refrigerator.

01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:19.170
Oh, you know,
um, I know what.

01:29:19.203 --> 01:29:20.404
I'm...

01:29:21.806 --> 01:29:23.641
I'm going to get
us some glasses.

01:29:23.675 --> 01:29:24.676
Okay.

01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:27.912
Hey, you've
stocked up, huh?

01:29:27.945 --> 01:29:29.514
Oh, I know. I'm...

01:29:29.547 --> 01:29:31.182
I'm always experimenting
with new recipes.

01:29:31.215 --> 01:29:32.650
I wonder if maybe
I could interest you

01:29:32.684 --> 01:29:35.186
in something like
I don't know,

01:29:35.219 --> 01:29:36.788
some strained zucchini, huh?

01:29:36.821 --> 01:29:38.790
Hmm. Maybe later.

01:29:38.823 --> 01:29:41.192
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
This is it.

01:29:41.225 --> 01:29:43.561
Here it is. Here.

01:29:51.569 --> 01:29:52.570
No?

01:29:54.572 --> 01:29:57.208
No? No. Oh, no, no.

01:29:57.241 --> 01:29:58.676
No.

01:29:58.710 --> 01:29:59.944
Yes?
Yeah...

01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:02.113
No, it's... Yeah, sure.

01:30:03.114 --> 01:30:04.448
Go ahead.

01:30:22.266 --> 01:30:24.235
Are you...
I mean, you're not
getting cold, are you?

01:30:24.268 --> 01:30:25.603
Mmm-mmm.

01:30:31.609 --> 01:30:34.245
You know something?
Hmm?

01:30:34.278 --> 01:30:37.582
Do you remember
that night at the library
when you asked me

01:30:37.615 --> 01:30:40.151
if all men made me nervous,
or if it was just you?

01:30:40.618 --> 01:30:41.853
Yeah.

01:30:41.886 --> 01:30:43.254
You know what
my answer is?

01:30:43.287 --> 01:30:44.589
What?

01:30:45.757 --> 01:30:47.725
I think that all men
make me nervous.

01:30:47.759 --> 01:30:48.760
Yeah.

01:30:49.894 --> 01:30:51.495
Except you.

01:31:33.337 --> 01:31:36.941
* In the wintertime

01:31:38.943 --> 01:31:41.946
* Moonlight

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.682
* In Vermont

01:31:45.683 --> 01:31:47.685
* Oh, people...

01:31:51.689 --> 01:31:55.827
* Are so entranced...

01:31:59.964 --> 01:32:01.198
Oh.

01:32:09.707 --> 01:32:10.808
Hi.

01:32:10.842 --> 01:32:13.945
Hi. You tired?
Hi.

01:32:13.978 --> 01:32:17.949
Well, I usually require
more than 20 minutes
sleep a night.

01:32:17.982 --> 01:32:19.250
Oh.

01:32:20.985 --> 01:32:21.853
Hi.

01:32:22.854 --> 01:32:24.689
ELIZABETH: Daddy!

01:32:24.722 --> 01:32:26.257
What are
you doing up?
Da-da?

01:32:27.258 --> 01:32:30.227
No, no, honey.

01:32:30.261 --> 01:32:33.831
No, this...
This is not
da-da.

01:32:33.865 --> 01:32:37.702
No. I think
she's at that age

01:32:37.735 --> 01:32:39.971
where she confuses
"man" with "da-da."

01:32:40.004 --> 01:32:41.238
Mmm.

01:32:42.406 --> 01:32:45.710
Oh, okay,
let's look here.

01:32:45.743 --> 01:32:49.714
Honey, I'll pick up
the phone.

01:32:49.747 --> 01:32:50.748
Hello.

01:32:51.415 --> 01:32:52.616
Fritz!

01:32:53.284 --> 01:32:54.285
Well...

01:32:55.019 --> 01:32:56.620
Well, hello! Hi.

01:32:57.889 --> 01:32:59.757
Well, I'm fine.
How are you?

01:33:01.759 --> 01:33:04.128
Oh, well, thank you!
Thanks!

01:33:04.161 --> 01:33:06.030
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

01:33:08.299 --> 01:33:09.633
They do?

01:33:10.034 --> 01:33:11.035
Really?

01:33:12.036 --> 01:33:14.739
They are? Well...

01:33:14.772 --> 01:33:17.641
Well, yes, of course
I would love to talk
to 'em.

01:33:18.442 --> 01:33:19.643
Um...

01:33:21.445 --> 01:33:23.647
Absolutely. Sure.
That would be great!
I...

01:33:25.049 --> 01:33:27.318
This afternoon
would be fine,
just fine.

01:33:29.921 --> 01:33:31.889
Okay, Fritz, okay.

01:33:31.923 --> 01:33:33.925
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:33:37.795 --> 01:33:39.897
The Food Chain wants
to buy Country Baby.

01:33:39.931 --> 01:33:41.332
Is it for sale?

01:33:42.466 --> 01:33:44.068
Well, I don't know! I...

01:33:45.803 --> 01:33:48.039
I don't know, but
the thought of going
back to New York

01:33:48.072 --> 01:33:50.441
as a hit is... Wow!

01:33:50.474 --> 01:33:53.945
I mean, we're
talking major big.

01:33:56.213 --> 01:33:57.681
Big, you know?

01:33:57.949 --> 01:34:00.051
Hmm.

01:34:00.084 --> 01:34:02.053
Well, so, I guess
this means you
won't be free

01:34:02.086 --> 01:34:04.688
for bingo tonight
down at the fire
station?

01:34:08.092 --> 01:34:11.362
Um, can I call you later?

01:34:12.496 --> 01:34:13.965
Sure. I'll be here.

01:35:10.421 --> 01:35:12.857
Sloane, Curtis and Co.,
will you hold, please?

01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:14.025
May I help you?

01:35:15.159 --> 01:35:16.861
Miss Wiatt!
Hi.

01:35:16.894 --> 01:35:18.395
You look wonderful!

01:35:18.429 --> 01:35:19.997
Oh, well,
thank you
very much.

01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:21.999
Would you tell
Mr. Curtis that
I'm here?

01:35:22.033 --> 01:35:23.000
They're all waiting
for you in the
conference room.

01:35:23.034 --> 01:35:24.869
Oh, good. Okay.

01:35:24.902 --> 01:35:26.003
Miss Wiatt's on the way.

01:35:39.450 --> 01:35:40.784
WOMAN: Hi.
Hello.

01:35:47.324 --> 01:35:48.926
HELEN: Hello, Miss Wiatt.
Hello, Helen.

01:35:53.597 --> 01:35:56.033
J.C., good
to see you.
Thank you.

01:35:56.067 --> 01:35:57.902
Where's the little one?
Oh, she's at home.

01:35:57.935 --> 01:35:59.570
Oh, too bad.

01:35:59.603 --> 01:36:01.038
Come on in!
We're all waiting.

01:36:01.072 --> 01:36:02.573
Thank you.

01:36:02.606 --> 01:36:04.175
You remember
Hughes Larrabee.

01:36:04.208 --> 01:36:06.443
Oh, Hughes.
Well, thank you
for coming.

01:36:06.477 --> 01:36:08.913
Good to see you.
And Fritz.

01:36:08.946 --> 01:36:10.581
J.C., welcome back.
Thanks.

01:36:10.614 --> 01:36:11.815
Shall we?

01:36:17.488 --> 01:36:19.090
You look terrific!

01:36:23.227 --> 01:36:27.198
First of all, J.C.,
on behalf of all of us,

01:36:27.231 --> 01:36:29.600
I want to congratulate you
on a great, great success.

01:36:29.633 --> 01:36:31.202
Thank you.

01:36:31.235 --> 01:36:33.938
Usually in a meeting
of this nature

01:36:33.971 --> 01:36:35.472
we have to take
the client by the hand

01:36:35.506 --> 01:36:37.942
and lead him through
the negotiations,

01:36:37.975 --> 01:36:40.077
but in this case,

01:36:40.111 --> 01:36:43.614
we know we're dealing
with a savvy business woman.

01:36:43.647 --> 01:36:45.616
Mmm-hmm.
So we'll cut through
the proverbial crap

01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:47.084
and get right to
the nitty-gritty.

01:36:47.118 --> 01:36:48.953
Hughes.

01:36:48.986 --> 01:36:50.955
As Fritz told you,

01:36:50.988 --> 01:36:53.958
The Food Chain is
interested in acquiring
Country Baby.

01:36:53.991 --> 01:36:56.093
You've discovered
an untapped market
in the food business,

01:36:56.127 --> 01:36:58.963
which is something
we all know is a pretty
tough thing to do.

01:36:58.996 --> 01:37:01.232
However, we truly feel

01:37:01.265 --> 01:37:03.634
that you've taken
this thing just about
as far as you can.

01:37:03.667 --> 01:37:06.103
You're working with
an inexperienced staff

01:37:06.137 --> 01:37:09.240
in a factory too small
for your product load.

01:37:09.273 --> 01:37:13.377
You're burdened with
a severely handicapped
distribution apparatus.

01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:16.513
What we'd like to do,
we'd like to help you
change all of that.

01:37:16.547 --> 01:37:20.251
We'd like to see Country
Baby on every supermarket
shelf in America.

01:37:20.284 --> 01:37:23.520
Mmm-hmm.
FRITZ: J.C.,
we all realize

01:37:23.554 --> 01:37:27.124
that you may still be
harboring some ill will.

01:37:27.158 --> 01:37:29.260
In fact, Hughes suggested
that we even consider

01:37:29.293 --> 01:37:31.128
bowing out of
these negotiations,

01:37:31.162 --> 01:37:34.665
but I assured him that
you were a big girl now,

01:37:34.698 --> 01:37:37.534
and that what happened
between us is strictly
water under the bridge.

01:37:37.568 --> 01:37:40.137
Oh, well, it's water
under the bridge

01:37:40.171 --> 01:37:42.006
depending on how good
your offer is.

01:37:48.179 --> 01:37:51.015
I told you
she'd play hardball.

01:37:51.048 --> 01:37:53.150
I learned
it from you, Fritz.

01:37:54.318 --> 01:37:56.053
FRITZ: Well, thanks.

01:37:58.055 --> 01:38:00.191
J.C., shall we look
at the proposal now?

01:38:10.067 --> 01:38:12.303
The Food Chain
will acquire
Country Baby, Inc.

01:38:12.336 --> 01:38:15.072
for $3 million, cash.

01:38:19.076 --> 01:38:21.045
Mmm-hmm.
HUGHES: In order to take

01:38:21.078 --> 01:38:23.714
some of the day-to-day
responsibilities
off your shoulders,

01:38:23.747 --> 01:38:26.317
we'd like to move
your base of operation
to Cleveland,

01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:29.320
so that our people
could oversee production.

01:38:29.353 --> 01:38:31.188
Country Baby homemade
in Cleveland?

01:38:31.222 --> 01:38:32.723
I don't think so.

01:38:34.358 --> 01:38:37.594
That point is negotiable.

01:38:37.628 --> 01:38:39.730
Naturally,
we'd like to retain
your services

01:38:39.763 --> 01:38:41.732
as chief operating officer,

01:38:41.765 --> 01:38:45.469
with a base salary
of $350,000 a year,

01:38:45.502 --> 01:38:47.738
with a bonus tied in
to the company's earnings

01:38:47.771 --> 01:38:51.342
of up to 150 percent
of your salary,

01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:55.212
which means, young lady,
that if the Country Baby
performs as expected,

01:38:55.246 --> 01:38:58.249
you're looking at close
to $1 million a year
in salary alone.

01:39:00.117 --> 01:39:01.385
What is that banging?

01:39:05.656 --> 01:39:08.092
Paragraph four.

01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:12.363
The Food Chain will
purchase an apartment
for you of your choice.

01:39:12.396 --> 01:39:15.099
Naturally, there are
various perks,

01:39:15.132 --> 01:39:19.103
six-week vacation,
golden parachute clause,
pension plan,

01:39:19.136 --> 01:39:21.272
and, of course,
use of the company jet.

01:39:26.410 --> 01:39:28.112
That's it?
That's it.

01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:37.788
Um...

01:39:37.821 --> 01:39:39.390
Well, Hughes,
would you mind

01:39:39.423 --> 01:39:42.393
if I take a few minutes
to think this over?

01:39:42.426 --> 01:39:43.694
No, I wouldn't
mind at all, please.
Not at all.

01:39:44.828 --> 01:39:46.163
Oh, thank you.

01:39:47.698 --> 01:39:49.133
Um, oh,
save my seat.

01:39:55.572 --> 01:39:57.408
I think it's
in the bag.

01:39:57.441 --> 01:40:00.411
Hope. Hope so.
Fine. Fine.

01:40:00.444 --> 01:40:02.446
What do you think?
Time for the champagne,
gentlemen?

01:40:10.854 --> 01:40:12.289
I'm back.

01:40:12.323 --> 01:40:13.724
I'm back!

01:40:17.728 --> 01:40:19.830
Yeah, I'm back.

01:40:19.863 --> 01:40:21.198
That's right.

01:40:53.364 --> 01:40:55.499
Oh, uh, sit
down, please.

01:40:59.503 --> 01:41:01.372
I think I'm gonna
have to pass.

01:41:01.772 --> 01:41:03.106
Excuse me?

01:41:04.375 --> 01:41:05.776
My answer is "no."

01:41:06.943 --> 01:41:09.480
Well,
which part no?

01:41:09.513 --> 01:41:13.350
No $350,000 base?
No bonus tie-in?

01:41:13.384 --> 01:41:16.119
No to all of it,
Fritz. Country Baby's
not for sale.

01:41:18.255 --> 01:41:20.224
But this is
a world-class deal.

01:41:20.257 --> 01:41:22.759
It'll make you richer
than you ever dreamed!

01:41:22.793 --> 01:41:24.895
I'm sorry, Fritz.

01:41:24.928 --> 01:41:28.232
I think I'm gonna have
to stay right where I am.

01:41:28.265 --> 01:41:30.367
Perhaps all that's
happened between us

01:41:30.401 --> 01:41:32.503
isn't water
under the bridge.

01:41:32.536 --> 01:41:35.372
Well, no.
Maybe it isn't.

01:41:35.406 --> 01:41:36.507
I mean, I was...

01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:38.809
I was very
excited about
this offer,

01:41:40.811 --> 01:41:42.513
but, you know, I don't
think I really thought

01:41:42.546 --> 01:41:45.416
about what it meant,
and you see,

01:41:47.284 --> 01:41:48.919
I'm not
The Tiger Lady
anymore.

01:41:48.952 --> 01:41:50.521
I mean, I have a crib
in my office,

01:41:50.554 --> 01:41:52.923
and there's a mobile
over my desk,

01:41:52.956 --> 01:41:55.526
and I really like that.

01:41:55.559 --> 01:41:58.262
I mean, Fritz,
do you remember
that night

01:41:58.295 --> 01:42:01.532
when you told me about
the things that I was
gonna have to give up

01:42:01.565 --> 01:42:04.268
and the sacrifices
that I was gonna
have to make?

01:42:04.301 --> 01:42:06.537
Well, I don't wanna
make those sacrifices.

01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:08.839
And the bottom line is
nobody should have to.

01:42:09.973 --> 01:42:10.841
No.

01:42:12.309 --> 01:42:14.545
I don't think
this is gonna
work out,

01:42:14.578 --> 01:42:16.813
and I'll be
honest with you,

01:42:16.847 --> 01:42:18.549
I think I'm doing
pretty good on
my own.

01:42:18.582 --> 01:42:20.684
To be quite frank,
if The Food Chain

01:42:20.717 --> 01:42:23.287
can put Country Baby
on every supermarket
shelf in America,

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.321
so can I.

01:42:27.458 --> 01:42:30.561
I'm sorry.

01:42:30.594 --> 01:42:33.864
I just think the rat race
is gonna have to survive
with one less rat.

01:42:35.466 --> 01:42:36.400
And anyway,

01:42:40.337 --> 01:42:43.440
I really think I'd miss
my 62 acres in Vermont.

01:42:43.474 --> 01:42:45.609
I mean, Elizabeth is
so happy there, and...

01:42:51.615 --> 01:42:53.584
And, well, you see,
there's this...

01:42:53.617 --> 01:42:55.486
This veterinarian
that I'm seeing.

01:42:57.354 --> 01:42:59.490
What's she saying?
She's a vegetarian?

01:43:00.757 --> 01:43:02.893
Do you realize
what you're
giving up?

01:43:03.494 --> 01:43:04.361
Yup.

01:43:05.362 --> 01:43:07.998
There's nothing
we can do to change
your mind?

01:43:08.031 --> 01:43:10.233
Mmm, nope.

01:43:23.914 --> 01:43:25.482
Hi. Is the doctor in?
Hi.

01:43:25.516 --> 01:43:27.250
Sure, honey.
Go on in.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.021
Hi. Hi, boy.

01:43:43.066 --> 01:43:44.368
Hi.
You're back?

01:43:44.401 --> 01:43:46.537
I am back.

01:43:48.071 --> 01:43:49.906
Well, how did it go?

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:51.642
Oh, I don't...
It just wasn't that
great a deal for me.

01:43:51.675 --> 01:43:53.377
No? It didn't pan out?
No.

01:43:53.410 --> 01:43:54.911
No.

01:43:54.945 --> 01:43:57.381
It's too bad.
Yeah, it's too bad.

01:43:57.414 --> 01:43:59.516
Does this mean
you're gonna be...
What?

01:43:59.550 --> 01:44:00.651
...hanging around
Hadleyville?
Yeah.

01:44:00.684 --> 01:44:02.285
It does?
Mmm-hmm.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.921
So, what do you think?
If you're free tonight,

01:44:04.955 --> 01:44:06.923
maybe you'd like to
come over. Maybe we
could, you know,

01:44:06.957 --> 01:44:08.659
watch the farm
report on TV?
Sure.

01:44:08.692 --> 01:44:10.527
Yeah?

01:44:10.561 --> 01:44:11.695
I gotta get to bed
kind of early, though.

01:44:12.563 --> 01:44:14.064
You do?

01:44:14.097 --> 01:44:15.566
Oh. Well, that's
no problem.

01:44:35.719 --> 01:44:37.554
Oh, hi. Shh. Shh.
Where is she?

01:44:47.598 --> 01:44:48.732
Elizabeth.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.001
Mama!

01:44:52.603 --> 01:44:55.472
Hello. Hello.

01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:59.710
What did you do today?
What did you do?
What did you do?

01:44:59.743 --> 01:45:02.713
Did you play?
Did you see
your friends?

01:45:02.746 --> 01:45:04.981
Did you?
Were you a good girl?

01:45:05.015 --> 01:45:07.751
See the flowers?
