about him?

00:05.704 --> 00:07.238
>> greatest mayor ever.

00:07.306 --> 00:09.773
>> could charm a bird
out of a tree.

00:09.841 --> 00:12.578
You'll have your own plaque
some day.

00:12.646 --> 00:17.418
>> you mean, as soon as I get
over this bump in the road.

00:17.486 --> 00:20.753
>> be calm, respectful.
>> ma.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.356
Like you always say,

00:22.424 --> 00:25.225
Today's headlines wrap
tomorrow's fish.

00:26.962 --> 00:27.929
>> chris palarno.

00:27.997 --> 00:29.997
Who invited him?

00:30.065 --> 00:31.732
>> I did.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.999
Let them see we're friendly.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.568
We have nothing to hide.

00:34.636 --> 00:37.104
>> I'm your campaign manager.

00:37.172 --> 00:39.006
You should have told me.

00:50.586 --> 00:52.953
>> mr. Palarno, did you remodel
the councilman's house

00:53.021 --> 00:54.288
In exchange
for city projects?

00:54.355 --> 00:55.722
>> councilman hayes-fitzgerald,

00:55.790 --> 00:57.724
Was mr. Palarno's work
on your home a form of a bribe?

00:57.792 --> 00:58.859
>> okay, okay.

00:58.927 --> 01:00.961
No one is hiding
from a full explanation

01:01.028 --> 01:03.430
Why a tabloid made headlines

01:03.497 --> 01:05.031
From some
of our accounting errors.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.666
>> the bribery scandal was
just the sizzle.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.701
Next comes the steak.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.269
Unless I'm made happy.

01:13.139 --> 01:15.240
50 gs by tomorrow.

01:15.307 --> 01:17.709
No way he lies his way out
of the next headline.

01:17.777 --> 01:20.846
I want my money now.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.648
>> I thought we said no more.

01:23.716 --> 01:27.385
>> we gotta bluff him,
baby.

01:27.452 --> 01:28.386
>> [shouts in spanish]
>> shh-shh.

01:28.453 --> 01:30.821
<i>Abre la puerta!</i>

01:30.889 --> 01:34.157
[pounding on door]

01:34.225 --> 01:35.425
>> you saw.

01:35.493 --> 01:36.893
I turned the heat down
with one press conference.

01:36.961 --> 01:38.694
A couple of more,
and it's gone.

01:38.762 --> 01:40.830
>> I still get
my big muni projects, though.

01:40.897 --> 01:43.699
>> we can't nurture allegations
of a quid pro quo.

01:43.766 --> 01:45.433
>> whoever hacked
into our e-mails

01:45.501 --> 01:46.868
Is stealing money
out of my pocket.

01:46.936 --> 01:48.536
I don't like it.

01:48.604 --> 01:50.604
>> chris, things will come up
in the private sector.

01:50.672 --> 01:52.072
>> tonight at the museum board's
dinner,

01:52.140 --> 01:54.407
We'll put your name in front
of all the right people.

01:54.475 --> 01:57.343
Main thing is--nothing rash.

01:57.411 --> 02:00.913
>> yeah.

02:00.981 --> 02:03.282
>> mrs. Hayes-fitzgerald, can
the kids have some ice cream?

02:03.349 --> 02:05.417
>> oh, it makes them too hyper.

02:05.485 --> 02:08.286
>> come on, josie.

02:08.354 --> 02:09.687
>> okay, I'm outnumbered.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.223
But only one scoop.

02:12.290 --> 02:13.757
If stacy calls,
tell her I'm on my cell.

02:13.825 --> 02:16.793
>> oh, goody,
we're gonna get ice cream.

02:16.861 --> 02:19.062
>> she hasn't called in days,
neil.

02:19.130 --> 02:22.232
>> I still can't believe it.

02:22.299 --> 02:25.101
>> oh, you heard the call.
Someone's bringing cash.

02:25.169 --> 02:27.436
>> I'm so glad we didn't have
to, you know,

02:27.504 --> 02:29.404
Do the other thing.

02:29.472 --> 02:33.041
>> now aruba's got
topless beaches.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.375
[chuckles]

02:37.112 --> 02:39.246
Oh, you wanna get high?

02:39.314 --> 02:41.114
Get high on this.

02:41.182 --> 02:45.084
[knock on door]

02:45.152 --> 02:47.787
Here we go.
Payday.

02:56.028 --> 02:58.997
>> [screams]

03:10.075 --> 03:13.276
[knock on door]

03:13.344 --> 03:14.911
>> stacy?

03:14.979 --> 03:18.147
Stacy, it's mom.

03:18.215 --> 03:20.216
Stacy?

03:46.507 --> 03:48.007
CC Ripped by Elderman.

04:17.430 --> 04:18.497
>> when I heard who she was,

04:18.564 --> 04:20.165
I figured
major case should be on this.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.300
>> tough week for
councilman hayes-fitzgerald.

04:22.368 --> 04:24.335
A bribery scandal
and his daughter's the victim

04:24.403 --> 04:25.736
Of a shootout.

04:25.804 --> 04:27.671
>> yeah, I'm told
she's actually his stepdaughter.

04:27.739 --> 04:30.841
>> and he is?
>> richard siebert.

04:30.909 --> 04:35.576
25. Unemployed.
Live-in boyfriend.

04:35.644 --> 04:39.612
Not the nice guy you bring home
to meet the folks.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.847
>> is this her place? His?

04:41.915 --> 04:43.615
>> her parents pay the rent.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.116
>> did she talk to anybody
before they took her

04:46.184 --> 04:47.484
To bellevue?

04:47.552 --> 04:49.619
>> uh, when I got here, she was
already in the ambulance.

04:49.686 --> 04:53.221
>> you should take that computer
in for a complete download.

04:53.289 --> 04:56.856
Looks like there's interest
in her stepdad's problems.

05:01.013 --> 05:02.013
From the notes on these margins,

05:02.081 --> 05:05.583
It looks
like she enjoyed them.

05:05.651 --> 05:07.985
>> I just spoke
with the e.R.

05:08.053 --> 05:10.087
A bullet was removed
from the girl's left shoulder.

05:10.155 --> 05:11.288
It's the same bullet
that went through him,

05:11.356 --> 05:13.456
So it's pretty deformed.

05:13.524 --> 05:14.590
She'll be okay.

05:14.658 --> 05:16.592
So the deadbolt is not broken,

05:16.660 --> 05:18.127
But the jam is splintered.

05:18.194 --> 05:20.362
Detective, you're him.

05:20.430 --> 05:21.930
So he comes to the door,

05:21.997 --> 05:23.731
He unlocks the bolt,

05:23.799 --> 05:27.101
The killer hears that,
and he kicks the door in.

05:27.169 --> 05:28.369
You jump back.

05:28.436 --> 05:30.537
Grabs the lamp.

05:30.605 --> 05:32.338
Throws it.

05:33.176 --> 05:35.377
>> and stacy's on the couch.
She jumps up.

05:35.445 --> 05:38.747
>> he turns to protect her.

05:38.815 --> 05:41.382
The killer fires again.

05:41.450 --> 05:43.384
The bullet passes through him,
hits her.

05:43.452 --> 05:45.920
He hits the ground,
bleeds out.

05:45.987 --> 05:47.654
Why was he moved?

05:47.722 --> 05:50.390
>> the mother found stacy pinned
under him.

05:50.458 --> 05:52.292
>> under his dead body?
For how long?

05:52.359 --> 05:54.961
>> from the lividity
three or four hours.

05:55.028 --> 05:56.562
Maybe she saved herself
by playing dead.

05:56.630 --> 05:59.264
>> or the killer
only wanted him.

05:59.332 --> 06:03.434
We'll do a vehicle canvass
in the area.

06:03.502 --> 06:05.269
>> you want me
to be in pain.

06:05.337 --> 06:07.504
>> you heard what she said.
No more pain medication.

06:07.572 --> 06:10.340
>> you want me
to be punished.

06:10.408 --> 06:14.643
>> stacy, this is withdrawal
that you're experiencing,

06:15.371 --> 06:17.405
I don't mean to be so blunt,

06:17.473 --> 06:19.007
But we need you to remember
what happened

06:19.074 --> 06:20.474
When it's fresh in your mind,
okay?

06:20.542 --> 06:23.677
>> I don't remember anything.

06:23.745 --> 06:24.677
I left.

06:24.745 --> 06:26.679
>> you mean you tried to escape?

06:26.747 --> 06:28.814
>> no.

06:30.984 --> 06:32.117
>> we need to know
what happened.

06:32.185 --> 06:37.420
>> after I was shot,
I could feel him

06:37.488 --> 06:40.923
In the room with me,
so I had to go.

06:40.991 --> 06:43.357
I went away.

06:43.425 --> 06:48.561
Like I was watching,
but I wasn't.

06:51.764 --> 06:55.199
But I am in pain now.

06:55.267 --> 07:00.137
Real pain.

07:00.205 --> 07:01.504
>> so councilman
hayes-fitzgerald's daughter

07:01.572 --> 07:04.775
Was shot in what appears
to be a drug crime.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.610
>> it's actually stepdaughter.

07:06.678 --> 07:09.080
Her mother was widowed.
>> whatever.

07:09.147 --> 07:10.449
My hope is a quick resolution

07:10.516 --> 07:12.617
That doesn't antagonize
a powerful politician

07:12.685 --> 07:15.786
Over an errant family member.

07:15.854 --> 07:17.621
Chief of ds is coming by.

07:17.689 --> 07:19.456
>> so far it has the look

07:19.524 --> 07:21.057
Of a drug deal gone bad.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.025
They were packed
for a flight to aruba,

07:23.093 --> 07:24.726
New clothes,
new luggage.

07:24.794 --> 07:29.730
Rick siebert might have stiffed
the wrong dealer.

07:29.798 --> 07:31.264
>> I'll tell them
a full canvass

07:31.332 --> 07:34.801
Is checking into
who that might be.

07:34.868 --> 07:38.304
>> start a canvass and suddenly
every douche bag's got a story.

07:38.372 --> 07:39.872
>> the story on you
from the landlord

07:39.939 --> 07:41.806
Is that you were banging
on rick siebert's door,

07:41.874 --> 07:43.708
Screaming threats.

07:43.776 --> 07:45.443
>> was that for drugs or money
or both?

07:45.511 --> 07:47.378
>> I got nothing to say.

07:47.446 --> 07:48.412
>> really, you're not worried

07:48.480 --> 07:49.914
About threatening
a murder victim?

07:51.683 --> 07:53.283
>> guys, I'm on the job.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.355
Check with occd.
Gonzo ruiz.

07:59.422 --> 08:02.056
>> all right, you just give me
a shove then.

08:02.124 --> 08:03.557
>> I'm outta here.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.659
>> hey, hey, hey, hey,
sit down.

08:05.727 --> 08:09.362
All right.
Let's talk about rick siebert.

08:09.430 --> 08:10.597
>> I bought siebert's debt.

08:10.665 --> 08:12.434
They put me
into play in his neighborhood.

08:12.501 --> 08:14.135
>> you wouldn't buy a debt
knowing it was bad.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.570
That'd make you look stupid.

08:15.638 --> 08:17.638
>> he's a dumb kid from jersey
hooked on drugs.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.140
Always scheming his way
on the street,

08:19.208 --> 08:20.674
And people fronted him
'cause he said

08:20.742 --> 08:22.208
Big family money was coming.

08:22.276 --> 08:24.343
>> from her family.

08:24.411 --> 08:25.511
>> everybody knew
who she was.

08:25.579 --> 08:27.412
And siebert said
her family owed them.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.981
Whatever that means.

08:33.318 --> 08:35.287
>> turns out rick siebert had
a marketable skill.

08:35.355 --> 08:36.955
These files from his laptop

08:37.023 --> 08:40.291
Have hayes-fitzgerald's
personal e-mails.

08:40.359 --> 08:41.859
>> he hacked in.
What did he get?

08:41.486 --> 08:43.154
>> well, for one thing
correspondence

08:43.221 --> 08:45.122
Between the councilman
and his contractor

08:45.189 --> 08:46.389
That fed the tabloids.

08:46.457 --> 08:48.490
Could be the family money
he was talking about.

08:48.557 --> 08:52.025
>> but the killing was
after he sold to the tabloids.

08:52.093 --> 08:55.094
>> revenge?

08:55.162 --> 09:00.098
>> or maybe he threatened
something bigger to come?

09:00.166 --> 09:01.566
>> rick siebert wasn't welcome
in our home.

09:01.634 --> 09:04.401
Unfortunately, that meant
we didn't see much of stacy.

09:04.469 --> 09:06.369
>> but you paid her rent.

09:06.437 --> 09:08.037
>> well, we knew he was gonna
sponge off of her.

09:08.105 --> 09:09.806
But it kept her
from sleeping in the street.

09:09.873 --> 09:11.941
>> even with rick siebert's
failings,

09:12.008 --> 09:13.108
He was a computer whiz.

09:13.176 --> 09:17.078
I mean, he hacked
into your e-mails.

09:17.146 --> 09:18.780
>> siebert sold that stuff
to the tabloids?

09:18.847 --> 09:21.115
>> he never made demands
on you?

09:21.183 --> 09:23.851
<i>For a bigger payday
than what he got at the ledger?</i>

09:23.918 --> 09:26.553
>> those stories are fabricated
from accounting errors.

09:26.621 --> 09:30.056
I would never have given him
anything anyway.

09:30.123 --> 09:32.091
>> he told people
he had more money coming.

09:32.159 --> 09:35.360
Maybe for material
of even greater value.

09:35.428 --> 09:36.828
>> he was
a delusional crackhead.

09:36.895 --> 09:38.029
Why would you listen
to him?

09:38.096 --> 09:40.497
>> and stacy?

09:40.565 --> 09:43.467
>> let's leave stacy
out of this.

09:43.534 --> 09:45.168
I don't think she had anything
to do with it.

09:45.236 --> 09:48.237
>> you honestly believe that?

09:49.906 --> 09:51.573
>> can you prove otherwise?

09:56.612 --> 09:58.746
I didn't think so.
Ahem.

09:58.813 --> 10:03.249
I have a meeting.

10:03.317 --> 10:05.817
>> very forgiving
toward his stepdaughter

10:05.885 --> 10:08.953
Who nearly got him knocked out
of a mayoral race.

10:09.021 --> 10:11.555
>> let's talk to the contractor
who stands to lose millions

10:11.623 --> 10:13.223
In city projects.

10:14.592 --> 10:17.026
>> I was at a bar, harley's,
having a beer,

10:17.094 --> 10:18.661
Watching the game
with some of my guys.

10:18.728 --> 10:20.596
>> who will back you up
to keep their jobs.

10:20.664 --> 10:22.231
>> who will tell the truth.

10:22.298 --> 10:23.532
Why would I want to kill
that punk?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.133
I didn't even know him.

10:25.201 --> 10:29.003
>> rick siebert, he smeared you
with some very inside dirt.

10:29.071 --> 10:30.805
>> sticks and stones,
detective.

10:30.873 --> 10:33.074
>> on the news, you said
you'd find the creep

10:33.142 --> 10:35.376
Who spread those lies
and deal with him.

10:35.444 --> 10:38.145
>> I was mad.
Maybe I meant it a few days ago.

10:38.213 --> 10:40.814
But providence stepped in.

10:40.882 --> 10:42.949
>> providence could have been
someone you hired.

10:43.017 --> 10:46.119
>> oh, please, I'm losing trade
from tabloid headlines.

10:46.186 --> 10:47.720
I'm gonna compound my problems?

10:47.788 --> 10:52.925
I'm gonna risk the whole
operation by hiring a hit?

10:52.993 --> 10:55.360
>> okay,
harley's till what time.

10:55.428 --> 11:00.699
>> last call.
I got business.

11:00.767 --> 11:01.700
>> mom, you don't need
to wait.

11:01.768 --> 11:03.001
I'll get a cab.

11:03.068 --> 11:04.469
>> you're not going back
to your place.

11:04.536 --> 11:05.470
It's too dangerous.

11:05.538 --> 11:07.038
>> like I'm going with you.

11:07.106 --> 11:08.973
I'm over 18.
I can go where I please.

11:09.041 --> 11:12.544
>> which is why you're here.
Thank god you're alive.

11:12.611 --> 11:14.345
>> I can get by on my own.

11:14.413 --> 11:17.415
>> based on recent events,
I think you need us

11:17.483 --> 11:19.250
More than we need you.

11:19.318 --> 11:21.552
Josie, did you tell her about
sophie's little hunger strike?

11:21.620 --> 11:23.086
>> what?

11:23.153 --> 11:25.152
>> she misses you, stacy.

11:25.219 --> 11:28.215
Both kids want you home.

11:28.283 --> 11:30.949
>> and they found crack
in that apartment.

11:31.017 --> 11:34.885
So you could face
drug possession charges.

11:34.953 --> 11:35.953
You're gonna need us.

11:38.123 --> 11:39.956
Just like you did before.

11:48.797 --> 11:49.634
Did you know Rick Siebert

11:49.657 --> 11:50.923
As an addict?

11:50.991 --> 11:52.424
Why didn't stacy live
with you?

11:52.492 --> 11:54.426
>> excuse me, addict or not,
the death of a young man

11:54.493 --> 11:56.460
And the wounding of our child
is a tragedy.

11:56.528 --> 11:58.362
>> he is slick.

11:58.430 --> 12:01.364
Hayes-fitzgerald
just tap-danced

12:01.432 --> 12:03.835
Very effectively to the tune
of siebert's death.

12:03.903 --> 12:05.539
>> must be in his genes.

12:05.607 --> 12:10.481
His great-grandfather was
a tammany ward heeler.

12:10.549 --> 12:13.117
And then he was made
building commissioner

12:13.184 --> 12:14.418
When his predecessor was found

12:14.485 --> 12:16.319
Floating
under the 59th street bridge.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.688
>> [sighs]

12:18.756 --> 12:21.557
Hayes-fitzgerald.
What's with the fancy hyphenate?

12:21.625 --> 12:24.426
>> hayes is his mom's side
of the family.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.528
Now they've run city hall
on three occasions.

12:26.596 --> 12:28.130
>> which might have given her

12:28.197 --> 12:29.464
Some useful connections.

12:29.532 --> 12:31.300
>> these are the files
that rick siebert hacked into.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.902
This all
from the councilman's e-mails?

12:33.970 --> 12:37.839
>> he has correspondence
on rare wines.

12:37.907 --> 12:41.308
>> a chat room for oenophiles.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.877
<i>Not worth a headline
in the ledger.</i>

12:43.944 --> 12:46.445
>> yeah, but the effort
that rick made

12:46.513 --> 12:51.215
To put all this stuff together,
put it all into files...

12:51.282 --> 12:54.184
You know, it's like he had
the scent of something

12:54.252 --> 12:59.355
He thought was real value.

12:59.423 --> 13:00.956
>> so, attacking
your stepfather's career,

13:01.024 --> 13:04.259
Was that rick's idea
or yours?

13:04.327 --> 13:07.395
>> he knows?
>> we've spoken about it.

13:07.463 --> 13:08.863
But he doesn't believe
you were involved.

13:08.931 --> 13:10.465
He's certain
it was all rick's idea.

13:10.533 --> 13:13.735
>> well, it was.
Just for money.

13:15.838 --> 13:20.238
>> stacy, you wrote
"screw the bastard"

13:20.305 --> 13:21.307
On the margin
of one of the articles

13:21.375 --> 13:23.910
About your stepdad.

13:23.978 --> 13:26.611
To me, that seems like anger.

13:29.014 --> 13:31.815
>> I'm home now.

13:31.883 --> 13:33.116
I won't talk about that.

13:33.184 --> 13:35.018
>> she shouldn't have to.

13:35.086 --> 13:38.188
Stacy,
like many young girls, went

13:38.256 --> 13:42.725
Through a rebellious phase,
but we're all back together now.

13:47.197 --> 13:49.198
>> let's talk
abt the shooter.

13:49.265 --> 13:52.033
Any facial hair?
Scars?

13:52.101 --> 13:53.667
Piercings?

13:53.735 --> 13:57.335
>> he had a hat on.
His sleeves were pushed up.

13:57.403 --> 14:02.241
On his wrists and arms,
he had tattoos.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.576
Snakes or barbed wire.

14:04.644 --> 14:09.280
>> do you think
he thought you were dead?

14:11.349 --> 14:12.716
>> I don't know.

14:12.784 --> 14:17.453
He just shot, looked us over,
and left.

14:19.989 --> 14:23.158
>> if the killers
were after drug debt,

14:23.225 --> 14:24.692
Would have killed 'em,
you know,

14:24.760 --> 14:26.694
See that they were packed
for aruba...

14:26.762 --> 14:29.931
>> and tear the place open
looking for drugs, money.

14:29.999 --> 14:33.234
>> leaving the girl,
it's not a pro's move

14:33.301 --> 14:36.169
Unless they had
specific instructions.

14:36.237 --> 14:38.037
I mean, that brings it
closer to home.

14:38.105 --> 14:40.739
>> we should file a court order
for camille's laptop.

14:40.807 --> 14:42.875
>> yeah, and the wine
correspondence thing,

14:42.942 --> 14:45.977
It sounds like, you know,
like old mob code.

14:46.044 --> 14:48.912
You know, like tony needs
a shirt and a half

14:48.979 --> 14:50.446
By mother's day,
blah, blah, blah.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.815
>> we'll check on
the councilman's true passion

14:52.882 --> 14:54.616
For the grape.

14:54.684 --> 14:57.551
>> the councilman leaves
most selections to me.

14:57.619 --> 15:01.754
Last month, I sent him
this saint julienne.

15:01.821 --> 15:05.189
Full-bodied.
Long, beautiful finish.

15:05.257 --> 15:08.858
>> yeah, the councilman,
he keeps going on and on

15:08.926 --> 15:13.295
About a chateau jeunesse
'94 cab, right?

15:13.363 --> 15:16.564
<i>>> but it's a boire
dans sa jeunesse.</i>

15:16.632 --> 15:17.632
He wouldn't order that now.

15:17.699 --> 15:18.966
>> why not?

15:19.034 --> 15:21.802
>> well, you're supposed
to enjoy it in its youth.

15:21.870 --> 15:24.137
You know, seven to ten years
after its bottled.

15:24.205 --> 15:27.573
>> the councilman has
a fine palate.

15:27.641 --> 15:29.008
>> you know, we'd like to review
his purchases

15:29.076 --> 15:30.311
In the last six months.

15:30.379 --> 15:32.382
>> [laughing] we can't disclose
this information.

15:32.450 --> 15:36.391
>> unless we shut you down
for a forensic audit.

15:36.459 --> 15:41.831
>> [in bad french accent]
a print-out would do, huh?

15:41.899 --> 15:43.332
Coupla e-mails here

15:43.400 --> 15:45.334
Where the wine buddies
are talking

15:45.402 --> 15:48.104
About a '97 rioja.

15:48.172 --> 15:49.439
The councilman never ordered
any rioja.

15:49.507 --> 15:51.541
>> well, same thing
as the jeunesse cab.

15:51.608 --> 15:52.775
He never purchased it.

15:52.843 --> 15:54.776
>> it's a code.

15:56.578 --> 16:00.048
>> looks like
our vehicle canvass paid off.

16:00.115 --> 16:04.119
An '06 black van was ticketed
for blocking a driveway

16:04.186 --> 16:08.355
Ha a block from stacy's place
at 3:28 a.M.

16:10.256 --> 16:12.554
Security cameras picked up
an illegal port entry

16:12.621 --> 16:15.523
Eight blocks away
from stacy's place.

16:15.590 --> 16:19.826
Same late model black van
at 3:46 a.M.

16:19.894 --> 16:23.596
>> so the killer shoots siebert.

16:23.664 --> 16:25.731
15 minutes later,
he parks his van

16:25.799 --> 16:27.999
By the river
and dumps the weapon.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.068
>> yeah.
We'll get the divers on it.

16:30.135 --> 16:31.202
>> registration?

16:31.269 --> 16:32.369
>> the van is registered

16:32.437 --> 16:36.072
To a toscano trucking company
in brooklyn.

16:37.741 --> 16:40.576
We're looking
for toscano trucking.

16:40.644 --> 16:41.977
>> who wants to know?

16:42.045 --> 16:44.779
>> is this the correct address
for the truckingompany?

16:44.846 --> 16:46.647
>> he's got
the whole third floor.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.715
>> and his name is?

16:47.783 --> 16:48.850
>> di rogga.

16:48.918 --> 16:50.518
If he got problems
with the cops,

16:50.586 --> 16:52.353
I have other people
who want that lease.

16:52.420 --> 16:59.192
>> take the over
on Thursday's game in philly.

16:59.260 --> 17:03.561
Forget about it.
You should know me by now.

17:03.629 --> 17:05.663
>> I never bet college baskets.

17:05.731 --> 17:07.397
That's a degenerate's game.

17:07.465 --> 17:10.000
>> mr. Di rogga.

17:10.068 --> 17:11.968
We're here 'cause we need
something moved.

17:12.036 --> 17:14.637
>> what?
>> this is a trucking company.

17:14.704 --> 17:17.973
>> everyone's out
on long hauls right now.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.876
>> well, we're here
on a short haul.

17:19.944 --> 17:23.614
You from here
to our headquarters.

17:23.682 --> 17:27.285
>> well, that would involve
my lawyer.

17:27.353 --> 17:29.621
>> you're quite a dedicated
fisherman, mr. Di rogga,

17:29.688 --> 17:32.156
Buying a boat midwinter.

17:32.224 --> 17:34.024
>> it's the right economy
to buy anything.

17:34.092 --> 17:37.361
>> and paying to dry-dock it
the rest of the winter?

17:40.865 --> 17:44.200
>> so where did you get
that 19,000 in cash from?

17:44.268 --> 17:46.369
>> it wasn't half that much.

17:46.437 --> 17:48.237
The guy was dying
to get rid of it.

17:48.305 --> 17:52.608
>> hmm, your new york
registration number.

17:52.676 --> 17:54.010
The seller, mr. Owens,

17:54.078 --> 17:56.779
Listed the purchase price
as $19,500.

17:56.847 --> 18:01.583
>> we'd really like to know
where that money came from.

18:04.071 --> 18:07.038
>> it was a token
of appreciation.

18:05.786 --> 18:09.021
I have a small trucking business
that hauls antiques

18:09.089 --> 18:10.556
For wealthy clients.

18:10.624 --> 18:12.525
They appreciate the care
I take.

18:12.593 --> 18:14.627
>> and they give you wads
of cash?

18:14.694 --> 18:15.728
>> oh, don't worry.

18:15.795 --> 18:20.832
Come tax time,
I'll report it.

18:20.900 --> 18:25.035
>> can I see your hand?

18:25.102 --> 18:27.703
>> sure.

18:27.771 --> 18:32.307
See something you like, I'll set
you up with my manicurist.

18:32.375 --> 18:35.543
>> well, you know,
our divers recovered

18:35.611 --> 18:38.647
This walther ppk .380

18:38.714 --> 18:40.314
From the river.

18:40.382 --> 18:42.582
Specifically from the port

18:42.649 --> 18:45.315
Where your van was spotted
making an illegal entry.

18:45.383 --> 18:48.950
You know, the funny thing is
about a walther ppk

18:49.018 --> 18:54.187
Is that it has a short grip.

18:54.254 --> 18:55.554
You know, see,

18:55.622 --> 19:00.590
When you load the clip,
you can pinch your little finger

19:00.657 --> 19:03.725
Very similar
to the pinch that you have.

19:03.793 --> 19:08.062
>> you have nothing tying
that gun to my client.

19:08.129 --> 19:10.097
We've been very cooperative.

19:10.164 --> 19:11.264
But I think
we're finished here.

19:11.332 --> 19:12.565
>> one more thing.

19:12.633 --> 19:14.133
Can you pull up your sleeves?

19:20.573 --> 19:23.041
>> looking
for something special?

19:23.108 --> 19:26.077
>> we're done, johnny.

19:32.115 --> 19:34.549
>> very smart.
Used a temporary tattoo.

19:34.617 --> 19:36.283
Deliberately kept
his sleeves up

19:36.351 --> 19:39.819
To draw attention
away from his face.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.710
The girl is key to
keeping a lid on things.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.391
Stacy's here.
What's your concern?

19:46.662 --> 19:49.862
She's fragile. She needs
an anchor to windward.

19:50.193 --> 19:54.093
There's only one person who
knows how to do that, who can do that.

19:59.247 --> 20:01.581
>> are you coming up now,
honey?

20:01.649 --> 20:04.650
>> did you take your pill?
>> mm-hmm.

20:04.718 --> 20:07.786
>> I'll be up
in a minute.

20:13.091 --> 20:14.524
Don't even say it.

20:14.592 --> 20:16.226
>> I can't help it.

20:16.294 --> 20:18.295
Why you picked her.

20:18.362 --> 20:21.530
Why not the girl
from the upstate family?

20:21.598 --> 20:23.565
Money, serious clout in albany.

20:23.633 --> 20:24.799
>> enough, ma.

20:24.867 --> 20:29.171
Josie has been very...

20:29.239 --> 20:30.608
Accepting.

20:33.046 --> 20:37.750
>> [laughs]

20:43.678 --> 20:43.845
[knock at door]

20:43.892 --> 20:44.793
>> stacy, honey?

20:45.740 --> 20:47.941
>> just a minute.

20:51.031 --> 20:52.567
>> you shouldn't be in here
all alone.

20:53.635 --> 20:54.735
You're on medication.

20:54.802 --> 20:57.304
>> then I'll get out.

21:01.676 --> 21:03.477
I need that towel.

21:12.620 --> 21:15.622
>> [sighs]

21:21.196 --> 21:22.963
Remember how you liked that?

21:23.030 --> 21:24.364
>> please don't.

21:30.036 --> 21:31.836
>> you'll always be my girl.

21:31.904 --> 21:36.541
You'll always be my girl.

22:07.168 --> 22:09.035
>> type and cross.
Prepare for intubation.

22:09.103 --> 22:10.770
Breathe her.
>> I got a bp. 70 palp.

22:10.838 --> 22:14.007
>> please, you got to save her.
Please.

22:19.626 --> 22:21.293
>> dr. Lansing,
our attending psychiatrist,

22:21.360 --> 22:23.161
Wants to stop by
when you feel you're ready.

22:23.229 --> 22:25.530
>> he needn't bother.

22:25.597 --> 22:28.432
>> you're on suicide watch
until he approves your release.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.567
>> I'm in no hurry to leave.

22:37.974 --> 22:40.542
>> the information
you gave us about rick,

22:40.610 --> 22:42.544
It was very helpful.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.512
>> I'm glad someone was helped.

22:48.083 --> 22:49.850
>> I was wondering
if you're feeling well enough

22:49.917 --> 22:52.852
To look at some photos.

22:54.855 --> 22:56.589
Just, if you see the man
that you described,

22:56.656 --> 22:59.258
Just tell me, okay?

22:59.325 --> 23:01.459
>> do we know
why he shot rick?

23:01.527 --> 23:03.161
>> no, we don't know that yet.

23:07.532 --> 23:13.303
[beeping]

23:20.610 --> 23:22.143
We just need
a few more minutes.

23:22.211 --> 23:23.310
>> she needs her rest.

23:23.378 --> 23:27.113
>> maybe you could just go
back over there.

23:27.181 --> 23:29.515
>> I'm fine.

23:43.163 --> 23:45.531
Actually, I don't think
I'm ready

23:45.598 --> 23:47.232
To do something
like this.

23:47.300 --> 23:50.369
>> it's okay.

23:53.006 --> 23:55.774
You've been through a lot.

23:55.842 --> 23:57.209
I understand.

24:03.483 --> 24:09.054
It must have been tough being
in that situation back at home.

24:09.122 --> 24:10.355
>> you don't know anything
about that.

24:10.423 --> 24:11.856
>> that's not true.

24:11.424 --> 24:14.126
I came from a bad home.

24:14.193 --> 24:16.862
You said,

24:16.929 --> 24:22.367
When bad things are happening,
you need to...

24:22.434 --> 24:24.669
Take yourself away
to another place.

24:24.737 --> 24:27.172
That's what I used to do.

24:27.239 --> 24:28.673
I used to just want
to lift myself up

24:28.741 --> 24:30.976
And take myself
to another place.

24:31.043 --> 24:34.112
You know, so I could see things
from somewhere else.

24:37.516 --> 24:42.153
>> maybe it was just the crack.

24:42.221 --> 24:44.289
>> I think we both know
that that's not true.

24:47.192 --> 24:49.994
>> I know
what you're thinking.

24:50.062 --> 24:52.063
You're wrong.

25:01.806 --> 25:04.474
>> my life has been
about saving stacy from herself.

25:04.542 --> 25:06.476
I homeschooled her
in the 9th grade.

25:06.544 --> 25:08.278
>> well, that can't have been
easy with your new baby.

25:08.345 --> 25:09.513
>> we had good help.

25:09.581 --> 25:10.948
We were all in europe
that year.

25:11.016 --> 25:13.250
>> come here, sophie.
Let mommy tie your shoe.

25:13.318 --> 25:14.451
>> and they had me.

25:14.519 --> 25:16.219
I have friends who stayed
in their villa.

25:16.287 --> 25:18.323
It was magnificent.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.025
Is that detective
still in there with her?

25:20.092 --> 25:21.092
>> yes.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.227
>> you can't hold stacy
to anything

25:22.295 --> 25:23.595
She says
after what she's been through.

25:23.663 --> 25:28.233
But she'll be home,
part of our family again.

25:28.300 --> 25:30.969
Like our time in siena.

25:31.037 --> 25:33.138
That was real happiness.

25:35.207 --> 25:36.374
>> they moved to europe.

25:36.442 --> 25:39.377
Odd choice for a politician
with a hot career.

25:39.445 --> 25:40.979
>> you know, we subpoenaed
stacy's records

25:41.046 --> 25:43.414
From dalecrest high.

25:43.482 --> 25:47.318
And she'd been acting out.
They recommended therapy.

25:47.386 --> 25:51.589
But instead her parents pulled
her out for homeschooling.

25:51.656 --> 25:53.424
>> well,
some people view therapy

25:53.491 --> 25:56.460
As an indictment
of their parenting skills.

25:56.527 --> 26:00.197
>> bigger reason
to duck out of therapy:

26:00.264 --> 26:03.199
Sexual abuse
by her stepfather.

26:05.803 --> 26:06.903
>> that's a headline
to die for

26:06.970 --> 26:08.271
If siebert knew about it.

26:08.338 --> 26:11.740
>> yeah, we don't have
direct evidence,

26:11.808 --> 26:15.877
But, you know, I think
he might have been onto it.

26:15.945 --> 26:18.179
>> hayes-fitzgerald's wife
could have known.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.380
> Well we've seen this before.

26:20.381 --> 26:24.981
After the initial outrage fear of
the shame overcomes everything.

26:24.982 --> 26:26.882
The wife joins with
the husband to keep it in-house.

26:26.883 --> 26:29.483
Even more of an
imperative in a political family.

26:29.597 --> 26:30.530
>> and camille?

26:30.598 --> 26:32.432
>> anything on the laptop?

26:32.500 --> 26:33.734
>> some cryptic e-mails.

26:33.801 --> 26:37.070
She refers to a potentially
volatile situation.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.905
>> use it.

26:38.973 --> 26:44.110
Find the raw nerve that breaks
through the family wall.

26:44.178 --> 26:47.180
>> so has the inconvenience
caused me by taking my laptop

26:47.248 --> 26:48.548
Been of some value?

26:48.616 --> 26:51.885
>> we're curious
about this volatile situation

26:51.952 --> 26:53.386
You've mentioned
in your e-mails to neil.

26:53.454 --> 26:58.258
>> volatile situations are
a daily occurrence in politics.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.626
>> well, I'll bring you closer
to home.

26:59.693 --> 27:04.030
You raised money for
the hayes-fitzgerald library,

27:04.098 --> 27:06.666
The beautification
of van-cortlandt park,

27:06.734 --> 27:10.303
And st. Lioba's, a shelter
for runaway teens.

27:10.371 --> 27:12.004
The strange thing
about that,

27:12.072 --> 27:14.540
This shelter got three times
what the others got.

27:14.608 --> 27:17.577
>> why should
my personal charities be

27:17.644 --> 27:19.645
Of any concern to you?

27:19.713 --> 27:20.746
>> well, these other
fundraisers,

27:20.814 --> 27:23.482
They're longstanding projects.

27:23.550 --> 27:25.218
But your interest
in st. Lioba's

27:25.285 --> 27:26.986
Surfaced just a few years ago.

27:27.054 --> 27:30.156
>> shortly after stacy left
dalecrest high.

27:30.223 --> 27:34.059
>> investigating an addict's
death does not give you

27:34.127 --> 27:36.528
The right to question
my personal generosity.

27:36.596 --> 27:39.398
I've had enough.

27:39.466 --> 27:41.433
I'm calling the commissioner.

27:44.771 --> 27:47.740
>> it's a raw nerve, huh?

27:52.078 --> 27:55.380
>> [sighs]
they have nothing.

27:55.448 --> 27:58.450
But they're fishing.
I'm worried.

27:58.517 --> 27:59.851
We don't want them
in stacy's records.

27:59.919 --> 28:04.122
I'm gonna call
the shelter director.

28:04.189 --> 28:06.324
>> if I had taken one
of these lucrative positions

28:06.392 --> 28:07.959
I was offered
in the private sector,

28:08.027 --> 28:11.162
I'd be immune
to this grief.

28:11.230 --> 28:14.198
>> that's not who you are.

28:14.266 --> 28:16.901
That is not who we are.

28:16.969 --> 28:19.871
The powerful in city governments
are a dying breed.

28:19.938 --> 28:23.941
The dalys in chicago,
a handful of others.

28:24.009 --> 28:26.711
This is our time, son.

28:26.778 --> 28:32.216
In an age of weakness,
you have a chance at real power.

28:38.123 --> 28:39.757
>> stacy is coming home,
everybody.

28:39.825 --> 28:41.258
>> that's great.

28:41.326 --> 28:42.560
The kids really miss you.

28:42.627 --> 28:45.596
>> sophie, tell your sister
how you feel

28:45.664 --> 28:46.764
When she's not around.

28:46.832 --> 28:49.300
>> sad. You wanna come home,
don't you?

28:49.367 --> 28:51.902
>> it's not that.

28:51.970 --> 28:53.904
You know I love you,
cutie.

28:57.676 --> 28:59.910
>> oh, back again?

28:59.978 --> 29:02.880
This is becoming harassment.

29:02.947 --> 29:05.582
>> we're looking for the man
who shot stacy.

29:05.650 --> 29:07.951
Why would that be
a problem?

29:08.019 --> 29:11.021
>> I just don't want
her pressured.

29:11.089 --> 29:12.890
Come on, kids.
Let's go.

29:12.957 --> 29:14.458
[grunts]

29:14.526 --> 29:17.327
We'll be in the hall.

29:17.395 --> 29:22.366
>> bye, stacy.

29:22.433 --> 29:24.101
Excuse me.

29:33.978 --> 29:36.779
>> I just saw him...

29:38.148 --> 29:39.716
You don't want him touching you?

29:44.121 --> 29:49.258
Stacy, it's hard
for victims

29:49.326 --> 29:52.895
Of this sort of thing
to have a normal relationship.

29:55.799 --> 29:59.101
Rick siebert...

29:59.169 --> 30:04.106
Might have caught on
to what was...

30:04.174 --> 30:05.908
>> yeah.

30:07.644 --> 30:09.812
>> he knew what happened.

30:12.282 --> 30:14.283
>> not at first.

30:17.654 --> 30:21.924
He asked me a lot of stuff.

30:21.992 --> 30:24.793
Like...

30:24.861 --> 30:27.363
Why I ran away and...

30:27.430 --> 30:29.264
What the shelter was like.

30:29.332 --> 30:32.134
>> st. Lioba's.

30:32.202 --> 30:35.671
>> rick might have threatened
blackmail

30:35.738 --> 30:39.207
Far beyond any kind
of political scandal.

30:39.275 --> 30:42.144
Which could have meant jail time
for your stepdad.

30:44.180 --> 30:46.515
>> and that's
why rick was killed.

30:54.824 --> 30:57.192
>> down here, jessica.

30:57.260 --> 30:58.960
So how should I make you feel
at home?

30:59.028 --> 31:01.162
>> this is like
your own private club.

31:01.230 --> 31:05.633
>> yeah, where I relax, enjoy
the pleasures of fine wine.

31:05.701 --> 31:08.436
I have a calvados
that once belonged to napoleon.

31:08.504 --> 31:11.205
>> so it's from
like 100 years ago?

31:11.273 --> 31:13.741
>> more like 200.

31:13.809 --> 31:14.909
>> can you still drink it?

31:14.977 --> 31:16.210
>> absolutely.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.048
Ah, you're cold.

31:20.116 --> 31:24.452
I have to keep it chilly in here
to protect the wine.

31:25.855 --> 31:27.289
Here.
Let me do you up.

31:34.898 --> 31:38.033
>> thanks for the tour.
I really appreciate your time.

31:38.101 --> 31:39.235
I know how busy you are.

31:39.303 --> 31:40.470
How about I talk to some people

31:40.537 --> 31:43.840
At city hall about
a summer internship program?

31:43.908 --> 31:45.508
>> that'd be awesome.
>> [laughs]

31:47.178 --> 31:49.446
>> daddy, daddy.
>> ah, who's my girl?

31:49.513 --> 31:53.450
>> me.
>> my girl and no one else's.

31:53.517 --> 31:56.619
Forever and ever.
>> ever and ever.

31:56.687 --> 31:57.954
>> [laughs]

32:09.065 --> 32:13.765
She's taken off from the house?
 We don't need that right now.

32:13.806 --> 32:14.806
 Ma, it'll be fine.

32:15.787 --> 32:17.387
That girl is unstable.

32:17.337 --> 32:19.837
So she's prowling the
 streets looking to get high. 

32:19.878 --> 32:24.578
Or talking to the cops. So
 much for keeping her grounded. 

32:24.619 --> 32:26.819
Hey I was supportive, even loving.

32:25.620 --> 32:30.320
And you went too far. 
You're always being led around by your.

32:30.361 --> 32:31.361
 Why do you
 always assume that I..

32:31.362 --> 32:32.362
 Because I know you.

32:40.723 --> 32:42.623
When I saw 
she'd gone I had to call you

32:48.434 --> 32:50.134
 guess we'll just play games.

32:52.435 --> 32:55.735
There's a reason why she doesn't
 want to share a roof with your husband.

32:58.269 --> 33:01.170
I think we all know
what that is.

33:04.707 --> 33:06.775
>> stacy says things,

33:06.842 --> 33:08.243
But she's not always telling
the truth.

33:08.310 --> 33:09.977
>> at what point
do you stop lying?

33:10.045 --> 33:12.145
How did he do it?

33:12.213 --> 33:14.015
Diminish you?

33:14.083 --> 33:17.919
Make you feel unworthy
of a man of his stature?

33:20.054 --> 33:23.056
How does someone justify
what he did?

33:25.694 --> 33:29.529
>> oh, god.

33:29.597 --> 33:32.331
>> how did you justify it?

33:34.934 --> 33:39.003
>> when the two of you met,
she was around 12.

33:41.373 --> 33:43.873
I've seen photos of her.
She was a beautiful girl.

33:43.941 --> 33:47.376
Did you consciously use that?

33:47.443 --> 33:50.712
>> no. My god, no.

33:50.779 --> 33:54.448
It--it just happened.

33:54.516 --> 33:56.550
>> and it happened again
and again and again.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.118
>> he loved me.

33:58.185 --> 34:00.353
>> and you paid for that
with access to your daughter.

34:02.356 --> 34:05.191
>> it's not just me.

34:05.259 --> 34:07.027
Stacy's unstable.

34:07.095 --> 34:12.268
The drugs and rick.
>> rick was a shelter for her.

34:12.335 --> 34:14.705
>> she talked about him
like he was a hero.

34:14.773 --> 34:17.107
>> well, you weren't there
for her.

34:17.175 --> 34:18.909
She had to have someone
to go to.

34:22.813 --> 34:26.850
>> [sobbing] oh.

34:26.918 --> 34:30.187
It's true.

34:30.254 --> 34:34.690
I was afraid
of losing everything.

34:34.759 --> 34:37.360
>> she ran away before.
Where did she go?

34:37.428 --> 34:41.630
>> to rick.

34:41.699 --> 34:44.333
Always to rick.

34:58.781 --> 35:00.649
>> you knew I'd be here?

35:00.717 --> 35:03.619
>> wasn't hard to figure out.

35:03.686 --> 35:05.420
Don't have anyone else
to go to.

35:05.488 --> 35:08.924
>> doesn't say much about me.

35:08.992 --> 35:10.559
Everyone calls him
a lowlife.

35:10.627 --> 35:13.028
>> well, you did deserve better.

35:15.565 --> 35:16.831
>> I had to get away.

35:16.899 --> 35:18.867
>> look, you shouldn't go away
this time.

35:18.934 --> 35:20.868
You have a responsibility,
you know,

35:20.936 --> 35:21.903
For somebody that you love,

35:21.971 --> 35:23.971
Somebody that you care about,
sophie.

35:24.039 --> 35:28.042
>> she's only a baby.

35:28.110 --> 35:29.210
Neil wouldt actually...

35:29.278 --> 35:31.345
>> maybe not.

35:33.114 --> 35:37.150
>> but you know, people
with his sickness,

35:37.218 --> 35:39.553
You know, their patterns--
they don't change.

35:39.620 --> 35:44.157
And he's gonna molest
other girls.

35:44.225 --> 35:47.727
He will hurt her.

35:47.795 --> 35:51.397
>> she's his blood.

35:51.465 --> 35:54.866
>> you want to take
that chance?

35:54.934 --> 35:57.235
Abandon her
like your mother abandoned you?

35:57.302 --> 36:01.905
Is that what you want to do?
>> you know?

36:01.973 --> 36:03.773
>> mm-hmm.

36:16.524 --> 36:18.291
>> I thought it would be nice
for the two of you

36:18.359 --> 36:21.627
To be together, you know,
since you're so close.

36:21.695 --> 36:22.895
>> drop it.

36:22.962 --> 36:24.696
My father hired and fired
police commissioners.

36:24.764 --> 36:27.732
I know how you work.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.267
>> of course you do.

36:31.370 --> 36:32.637
So...

36:32.704 --> 36:36.573
Rick siebert was very interested
in your correspondence

36:36.641 --> 36:37.874
With your wine pals.

36:37.942 --> 36:40.610
>> what's he talking about?
>> I don't know.

36:40.678 --> 36:42.211
>> something he never shared
with you?

36:44.115 --> 36:46.484
>> in these e-mails
to your pals,

36:46.552 --> 36:51.524
You say that there's
a special chateau jeunesse '94

36:51.592 --> 36:55.361
That you're longing
to savor.

37:01.001 --> 37:02.435
>> that was a joke.

37:02.503 --> 37:04.271
I know better
than to hang on to a jeunesse.

37:07.075 --> 37:09.342
>> yeah, right.

37:09.410 --> 37:13.314
But these are not
about wine.

37:14.816 --> 37:15.983
It's code.

37:16.051 --> 37:18.986
'94 is the year

37:19.054 --> 37:22.189
That your babysitter was born,
jessica.

37:22.257 --> 37:25.058
And in these e-mails
you brag

37:25.125 --> 37:30.429
To your--
your pedophile buddies

37:30.497 --> 37:31.564
That you would have sex
with her.

37:31.631 --> 37:34.400
>> [laughs]

37:34.467 --> 37:35.401
Are you insane?

37:35.468 --> 37:37.570
>> we have a witness.

37:37.637 --> 37:40.906
>> stacy saw you and jessica
come up from the wine cellar.

37:40.974 --> 37:42.407
That's where this all happens,

37:42.475 --> 37:43.775
Isn't it?

37:43.843 --> 37:46.979
>> stacy's brain is damaged
by drugs.

37:47.046 --> 37:50.015
I mean, you can't make a case

37:50.083 --> 37:51.984
With her testimony
about anything.

37:59.626 --> 38:02.528
>> how dare you.

38:04.097 --> 38:06.231
So you lied to them.

38:06.299 --> 38:09.067
>> I've given a statement.

38:09.135 --> 38:12.704
How you took me
to the wine cellar.

38:12.772 --> 38:14.072
What you did.

38:14.140 --> 38:16.675
>> you came from nothing.
Fatherless.

38:16.742 --> 38:19.010
And you turn on us

38:19.078 --> 38:21.279
With these disgusting
fantasies?

38:21.347 --> 38:22.580
>> the teen shelter didn't think
they were fantasies.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.682
Especially after they found out
she was pregnant.

38:28.487 --> 38:31.622
>> and you took her
to europe?

38:31.690 --> 38:34.392
To some secluded villa?

38:34.459 --> 38:35.726
Where was it, siena?

38:35.794 --> 38:37.528
Right?

38:39.698 --> 38:43.534
>> sophie's my proof.

38:43.602 --> 38:46.170
She's my daughter.

38:46.238 --> 38:48.805
My sister
and my daughter.

38:55.448 --> 38:58.517
>> feel good to tell someone,
stacy?

38:58.585 --> 39:01.220
How you danced around in your
underwear, getting me excited?

39:01.288 --> 39:03.589
Did you leave that part out?

39:03.657 --> 39:05.290
>> I was a child.
>> a child!

39:05.358 --> 39:07.325
>> you better get
the whole story down.

39:07.393 --> 39:09.727
Because that's exactly
how it's gonna go in court.

39:09.795 --> 39:11.629
Not just what I did,
but what you did.

39:11.697 --> 39:14.132
>> I can't.

39:20.974 --> 39:24.043
I can't do it.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.378
I'm too ashamed.

39:25.445 --> 39:29.482
>> no, no,
the shame will be his.

39:29.550 --> 39:31.918
Okay, not yours.

39:31.986 --> 39:33.987
>> you can trust us.

39:43.932 --> 39:46.267
>> so I guess
this interview is over.

39:46.335 --> 39:48.436
>> oh, you can go.
But you'll be back.

39:48.503 --> 39:49.604
In handcuffs.

39:49.671 --> 39:51.238
On a perp walk.

39:51.306 --> 39:53.340
>> oh, face it, detectives.

39:53.408 --> 39:55.108
I mean, without her,
what have you got?

39:55.176 --> 39:57.210
The effort
that you put into him,

39:57.278 --> 40:00.480
It's all been cursed
because of this weakness of his.

40:00.548 --> 40:02.683
>> shut the hell up.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.118
Mom, we're out of this.

40:04.185 --> 40:07.054
>> you're not out of this.

40:07.122 --> 40:08.622
All the dreams that your mother
had for your future,

40:08.690 --> 40:09.990
That's all gone.

40:10.058 --> 40:11.725
You just threw all that away.
You're not out of this.

40:13.261 --> 40:15.663
>> mom, they have no case.

40:15.731 --> 40:16.931
I mean, we can beat it.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.099
>> look at him.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.800
I'm sure
you've seen this before.

40:19.868 --> 40:23.069
"mama, please, mama.
Save me, mama."

40:23.137 --> 40:24.371
>> shut up, I said.

40:28.308 --> 40:31.109
>> all the time
that you've put into him...

40:33.579 --> 40:36.614
Your sacrifice was wasted.

40:36.682 --> 40:40.618
>> what sacrifice?

40:45.724 --> 40:49.760
>> camille,
your phone records...

40:49.827 --> 40:54.030
The phone calls back and forth
to rick siebert...

40:54.098 --> 40:55.965
On his disposable cell.

40:58.335 --> 41:00.269
You did everything you could
to meet the demands

41:00.336 --> 41:01.903
Ofislackmail.

41:01.971 --> 41:06.574
>> I only made phone calls
to determine stacy's well-being.

41:06.641 --> 41:08.909
>> doubling back
charity contributions

41:08.977 --> 41:12.245
To get the payoff money
for mr. Di rogga.

41:12.313 --> 41:13.713
That you did for your son.

41:13.780 --> 41:19.118
>> you're better
than I thought.

41:19.186 --> 41:20.686
>> better at what?

41:20.754 --> 41:23.256
Meaningless allegations?
Mom?

41:23.324 --> 41:26.126
I'll go to the right people,
get this turned around.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.428
I've always been able
to turn things around.

41:28.496 --> 41:29.529
>> you?

41:29.597 --> 41:31.398
You didn't deal
with rick siebert.

41:31.465 --> 41:33.333
>> what?

41:33.401 --> 41:37.003
>> your mother hired di rogga
to kill rick siebert.

41:37.071 --> 41:38.171
>> and you expect me
to believe that.

41:38.239 --> 41:39.472
Okay, see,
I don't believe that.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.674
>> of course not.
You think you just got lucky.

41:45.646 --> 41:48.147
One more time everything
just worked out for you.

41:51.285 --> 41:53.486
>> I honestly didn't know
anything about this.

41:53.553 --> 41:55.320
I mean,
if there was a plan

41:55.388 --> 41:56.955
To kill siebert,
I had no part of it.

41:57.023 --> 42:00.425
>> [laughing]
how quickly he scrambles

42:00.493 --> 42:02.094
To distance himself.

42:02.161 --> 42:04.196
>> oh, that can't surprise you.

42:04.264 --> 42:06.965
I'm sure he's done it before.

42:07.033 --> 42:08.133
>> and denied it.

42:08.201 --> 42:10.636
Your life is blessed
because of me.

42:10.704 --> 42:16.074
Because I dared to hope
to--

42:16.142 --> 42:18.444
I dared to dream
that you would have the stones

42:18.511 --> 42:20.312
To go the distance,
but I was wrong.

42:20.380 --> 42:21.514
>> ma!

42:21.581 --> 42:24.751
Please don't say these things.

42:24.819 --> 42:26.119
Not in front of them.

42:30.425 --> 42:32.392
>> I covered for you
a thousand times

42:32.460 --> 42:34.729
In a thousand different ways.

42:34.796 --> 42:37.031
And here we are.

42:37.099 --> 42:39.934
There's nothing more
that I can do for you.

42:44.974 --> 42:46.376
Stop crying!

42:52.649 --> 42:54.315
It doesn't mean that I don't...

42:54.383 --> 42:55.850
That I don't still love you.

42:55.918 --> 42:58.286
Because I love you.

42:58.354 --> 43:00.955
I still... I love you.

43:04.493 --> 43:06.361
[weeping]

43:06.429 --> 43:07.595
I love you.
