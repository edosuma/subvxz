00:38.625 --> 00:39.975
<i>short back and sides,</i>

00:40.065 --> 00:42.345
<i>and back and sides.</i>

00:45.145 --> 00:46.295
<i>I start at the crown,</i>

00:46.385 --> 00:49.185
<i>and work outwards methodically.</i>

00:50.345 --> 00:52.546
<i>I like
a calm working environment.</i>

00:52.625 --> 00:55.615
<i>Every barber has his quirk...</i>

00:55.705 --> 00:56.616
<i>well, except me.</i>

00:56.706 --> 00:59.305

01:28.507 --> 01:30.258
<i>Well, that rules me out.</i>

<i>Nobility of purpose?</i>

01:34.947 --> 01:37.828
<i>Can't help you there, either.</i>

01:48.108 --> 01:51.549
<i>My life's always been boring.</i>

01:58.669 --> 02:00.149
<i>That was all right.</i>

02:00.229 --> 02:01.869
<i>I was a boring kind of guy.</i>

02:17.470 --> 02:21.020
<i>If you'd asked me back then,
I'd have said I was content.</i>

<i>Then fate decided
to leap on my back,</i>

02:26.871 --> 02:28.101
<i>and I turned round and saw</i>

02:28.191 --> 02:29.781
<i>that I'd been nothing
all these years</i>

02:29.870 --> 02:31.431
<i>but a howling ghost.</i>

02:31.511 --> 02:33.391
<i>From nowhere, I was alive.</i>

02:36.271 --> 02:38.391
<i>I'd never had to
deal with the law before.</i>

02:38.471 --> 02:41.671
<i>Only had to look at a police
and I shatted.</i>

02:41.752 --> 02:43.262
<i>But circumstances changed...</i>

02:43.352 --> 02:46.502
<i>and, suddenly, I had my very own

02:46.592 --> 02:47.992
<i>breathing down my neck.</i>

02:51.512 --> 02:53.552
<i>Everywhere I turned,
there he was--</i>

02:53.632 --> 02:56.752
<i>this big slab of bastard
staring right back.</i>

02:56.832 --> 02:58.633
<i>Yeah, I was alive, all right,</i>

[Wullie]: He's not
in the Lynch league yet.

03:10.353 --> 03:13.103

She's a fuckin' liar.
I wasn't at Karen's.

03:23.954 --> 03:24.864
I had to go the hospital.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.104
A shadow on my lung.

03:26.194 --> 03:28.794
Nah, nah. It's fine.
They gave me tablets.

03:28.874 --> 03:30.704
What are we doin' tonight?

03:30.794 --> 03:32.074
Maybe you can
come by again,

03:32.155 --> 03:33.274
and I could gie ye
another "Maryhill Moothfae"--

03:33.355 --> 03:35.585

Well, the boxing chat.
Is it bothering ye?

Och.

- Aye.

04:05.476 --> 04:07.036
Let me get this straight.

04:07.117 --> 04:09.266
I was in the windae
for eight years,

04:09.356 --> 04:11.476

then the third.

04:11.557 --> 04:12.597

you've had a charisma bypass.

You look like a haunted tree.
That's all I'm saying.

04:39.958 --> 04:44.239
Well, your dad brought me
into this shop 20 years ago.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.309
I'd like to hear
what he has to say about this.

10:41.138 --> 10:43.178
You know, I was in that windae
for eight years.

10:43.258 --> 10:44.248
That meant something.

10:44.338 --> 10:47.009
I'm 50, Charlie.

10:47.098 --> 10:49.739
What the fuck happened there?

10:49.818 --> 10:51.328
I mean, it's every man's right

10:51.418 --> 10:53.249
to reach
his full potential. Right?

10:53.339 --> 10:54.819
But it passed me by.

10:54.899 --> 10:55.779
Aye.

10:55.859 --> 10:57.979
What am I gonna do?

10:59.418 --> 11:01.859
Nothing.

11:01.939 --> 11:04.169
I've got a mother
that's digging her claws in

11:04.259 --> 11:06.620
like an auld buzzard,

11:06.700 --> 11:08.930
I live in
a shitey, wee flat.

11:10.179 --> 11:11.849
And the last time
with a bird,

11:11.940 --> 11:14.299
"Shakin' Stevens"
was number one.

11:15.740 --> 11:18.780
I've not had
my kick at the ball.

11:18.860 --> 11:21.530
All I've got is that job.

11:23.501 --> 11:25.810
The bastards are trying
to take it away from me.

11:25.901 --> 11:28.341
[Charlie]:
You want them to like you?

11:28.421 --> 11:31.300
[Snickers]: Like me?

11:31.381 --> 11:33.741
I want to fuckin' kill them.

11:34.981 --> 11:36.701
Pew!

11:37.661 --> 11:38.861
[Chuckling]

11:38.941 --> 11:40.691
[McManaman]: He's fucking
laughing at us, 127.

11:40.781 --> 11:41.932
[Holdall]: Yes, sir.

11:42.021 --> 11:43.221
[McManaman]: The public

11:43.301 --> 11:44.811
are gonna string us up
for this, you realize.

11:44.901 --> 11:46.131
[Holdall]: Yes, sir.

11:46.221 --> 11:47.891
[McManaman]: Right.
I'm replacing you as lead.

11:47.982 --> 11:49.102
What?

11:49.182 --> 11:50.172
And you, 529.

11:50.262 --> 11:51.821
No, sir,
it's 20 past 10, sir.

11:51.902 --> 11:52.811
Is it?

11:52.902 --> 11:55.052
529's your fucking number!

11:55.141 --> 11:56.492
You're off the case as well.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.782
You'll be taking orders
from 119 from now on.

11:58.862 --> 12:00.822
Thank you, sir.

12:01.862 --> 12:03.342
[McManaman]: Just take me--

12:03.423 --> 12:05.222
uh, take me
through your plans, uh, 119.

12:05.303 --> 12:06.533
[Robertson]:
He'll strike again, sir,

12:06.623 --> 12:08.453
so we'll find out
who's recently disappeared,

12:08.542 --> 12:09.663
who last saw them.

12:09.743 --> 12:11.543
I'll put Holdall here
out in the field,

12:11.622 --> 12:13.263
investigating
the missing person files.

12:13.343 --> 12:14.903
[Holdall]: Don't you think
we should be looking

12:14.983 --> 12:16.023
for the rest of him?

12:16.103 --> 12:18.543
[McManaman]:
119's in charge now, 127.

12:18.623 --> 12:20.503
Is that plate
from the canteen?

12:20.584 --> 12:22.494
[Grumbling] Ah, fuck me.

12:22.584 --> 12:25.414
Tell forensics to get
their own fucking plates!

12:25.504 --> 12:28.544
I'm not eating off a plate
that's served up a human arse.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.694
Right. Off you go.

12:31.704 --> 12:33.214
Oh, ho, ho!
Listen to this.

12:33.304 --> 12:35.424

You'd have to
be desperate, eh?

12:54.504 --> 12:55.545
[Chris]: Nah, nah.
That's what we call a "GILF."

12:55.625 --> 12:56.505
[Alex]: What's that?

12:56.585 --> 12:58.305
It's a "Granny I'd Like To--"

12:58.385 --> 12:59.616
[Wullie]: Fuck's sake, Chris.
Come on.

12:59.706 --> 13:01.376
Right, McAllister this weekend
at Bellahouston--

13:01.465 --> 13:02.425
what's his chances?

13:02.506 --> 13:05.896
[Chris]: Good boy, but...

[Barney]:
<i>I always loved Westerns.</i>

13:09.146 --> 13:11.426

"The Man With No Name",</i>

<i>Well, careful
what you wish for.</i>

13:30.747 --> 13:33.107
[Wullie]: Barney.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.937
[loudly]: Barney!

13:36.867 --> 13:38.747
A wee word?

13:40.948 --> 13:43.748
I'm not really sure
how to say this.

13:43.828 --> 13:46.108
A pal of my dad's
has moved into the area.

13:46.188 --> 13:47.858
He wants to give him a job.

13:47.949 --> 13:49.149
[Barney]: Eh?

13:49.228 --> 13:51.348
[Wullie]: Cannae have ye

13:51.429 --> 13:53.068

in the shop, Barney.

13:53.149 --> 13:54.268
And we can't have
any more outbursts

13:54.349 --> 13:55.628
like ye had yesterday.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.908
- Oh, no, that was a one-off.
- That was not a one-off.

13:57.989 --> 13:59.949
You have regular outbursts.

14:00.028 --> 14:01.829
[overlapping conversation]

14:01.909 --> 14:03.499
You cannot talk
to customers like that.

14:03.589 --> 14:04.819
It's not my fault
you look like

14:04.909 --> 14:06.710

14:11.910 --> 14:13.899
You can work for another month,

14:13.989 --> 14:15.270
[Barney]: Aw, Jesus. Wullie!

14:15.350 --> 14:16.340
[Wullie]: We'll understand

14:16.430 --> 14:17.779
if you want
to leave now, of course,

14:17.870 --> 14:19.700
and we'll keep pay your wage
for the rest of the month.

14:19.790 --> 14:21.620
You don't need to make
a decision now, but--

14:21.710 --> 14:22.990
I'll stay for the month.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.030
- Eh?
- I'll stay for the month.

14:25.110 --> 14:28.150
But we would be paying
your wage for the month,

14:28.230 --> 14:29.191
whether you're here or no.

14:30.190 --> 14:31.510
Well, I'll be here.

14:32.671 --> 14:34.421

Wullie, Wullie--
look, please.

14:51.792 --> 14:53.382
Don't do this.

14:53.471 --> 14:54.702
It's not my decision.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.221
[Barney]: Ah, but you see,
this place,

14:56.312 --> 14:57.712
it's all I know.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.432
Come on, Wullie.

14:59.512 --> 15:00.942
Be a pal.

I've got nothing else on.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.993
Aw, Barney.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.513
Still, it's not my decision.
It's up to my da.

15:07.592 --> 15:09.473
No, no. That's rubbish!
It is your decision.

15:09.552 --> 15:11.353
You and Chris.
You want me out the door.

Think I'm a fucking idiot?

15:12.553 --> 15:14.303
I'll get the mop.

No, Wullie, Wullie, please.

You'll no hear
another peep out of me.

15:23.434 --> 15:24.783
You're embarrassing
yourself now, Barney.

15:24.873 --> 15:25.994
Have a bit of self-respect.

15:26.073 --> 15:27.144

it was that.

yesterday.

anything to you?

Mr. Porter in, please?

hide in toilet cubicles,

I was about to die,

to see this man.

he said to me?

instigator

32:49.731 --> 32:51.011
[Mrs. Gaffney]: I like soup!

32:51.091 --> 32:52.681
Mrs. Gaffney!

32:52.771 --> 32:53.892
The laundrette's shut.

32:53.971 --> 32:56.491
Cheerio, then.

32:56.572 --> 32:57.721
[Mrs. Gaffney]: Suit yourself.

32:57.811 --> 32:59.451
[Barney]: Cheerio.

32:59.531 --> 33:01.092
[Loud chatter and laughing]

33:01.171 --> 33:03.081
[Whimpers] Oh!

33:10.572 --> 33:13.012
[Grunts] Ahh!

33:34.133 --> 33:35.613
[music stops]

33:35.694 --> 33:37.014
Thanks very much.

33:37.093 --> 33:38.524
I enjoyed myself.

33:38.614 --> 33:40.254
Uh-huh. You watch yourself.

33:40.334 --> 33:41.534
[Farewells continue,
faint and indistinct]

33:41.613 --> 33:42.894
[Cemolina]: Watch yourselves.

33:42.974 --> 33:43.854
Fine, fine.

33:43.934 --> 33:46.604
All right. Okay.

33:46.694 --> 33:48.924
Night-night.

33:57.095 --> 33:58.085
in the morning.

33:58.175 --> 33:59.605
Two days, all-in,

33:59.694 --> 34:02.365
including breakfast
and your evening meal--

34:02.455 --> 34:03.495
42 pounds!

34:03.575 --> 34:04.455
You believe that?

34:04.535 --> 34:08.415
How did
you manage that?

34:08.495 --> 34:10.295
You chopped him up!

34:10.376 --> 34:13.366
You've even
fucking labelled him!

34:15.095 --> 34:17.766
I label everything.

34:21.096 --> 34:22.246

34:40.016 --> 34:41.817
James?

34:41.897 --> 34:43.177
[James]: Barney.

34:43.257 --> 34:44.977
On the button.

34:45.057 --> 34:46.257
Appreciate that.

34:46.337 --> 34:47.927
I'll be here until

34:48.018 --> 34:50.407
that son of mine decides
to show his face again.

34:50.497 --> 34:51.977
Right.

34:55.618 --> 34:58.338
Wife's convinced
that killer's got him.

34:58.418 --> 35:02.208
Could be posting his baws
from Arbroath as we speak.

35:02.298 --> 35:03.498
Aye.

35:03.579 --> 35:04.808
It doesn't compare

35:04.899 --> 35:07.258
to what he'll get
when I get my hands on him.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.649
You look hellish.

35:09.739 --> 35:12.339
You found yourself
a woman yet?

35:12.419 --> 35:13.739
Nah.

35:13.819 --> 35:15.569
That's a fucking empty
existence you've got there,

35:15.658 --> 35:16.539
is it no?

35:16.619 --> 35:18.209
Sometimes.

35:18.299 --> 35:20.179
[key jiggles in lock]

35:22.539 --> 35:23.689
[James]: Minute late, Porter.

35:23.780 --> 35:25.339
Not impressed.

35:25.420 --> 35:27.140
Sorry, Mr. Henderson,
I was, eh...

35:27.219 --> 35:28.500
I was coming
along the green there

35:28.580 --> 35:31.409
and I was threatened
by a bunch of, um... wasps.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.730
[Clicks radio on,
rock music plays]

35:39.460 --> 35:41.420
[James]: Get that shite off.

35:42.981 --> 35:44.701
[Radio clicks off]

35:44.780 --> 35:46.450
Did, uh...

35:46.541 --> 35:49.061
Wullie have a chat with you
the other day?

35:49.141 --> 35:52.851
Well, did he say anything
about anything?

35:52.941 --> 35:54.341
Not that I can think of.

35:54.421 --> 35:56.621
Ahh.

35:56.701 --> 35:58.691
Glad to hear it.

36:01.182 --> 36:02.061
[Robertson]: Up, down, up, down!

36:02.142 --> 36:03.291
Are we a team?

36:03.381 --> 36:04.422
[Officers]: Yes!

36:04.502 --> 36:06.142
- Let me hear ya! Are we a team?
- Yes!

36:06.222 --> 36:07.102
[Robertson]: For fuck's sakes.

36:07.182 --> 36:09.412
Two, three, four...

36:09.502 --> 36:11.942
five, six, seven...

36:12.022 --> 36:13.532
[Holdall]: Everybody's looking.

36:13.622 --> 36:15.902
This is the heart attack
capital of Europe.

36:15.982 --> 36:16.942
Look at the state of you!

36:17.022 --> 36:18.253
You look like
a depressed milkmaid.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.293
[Holdall]: What is this?

36:20.382 --> 36:22.583
The "River Dance" branch?

36:22.662 --> 36:23.862
Update me.

36:23.943 --> 36:25.143
[Holdall]: The barber, Thomson,

36:25.222 --> 36:26.973
he was a bit weird.

36:27.063 --> 36:29.293
I think we should have
another shot at him.

36:29.383 --> 36:30.533
[Robertson]:
What's his connection

36:30.623 --> 36:31.773
to the other victims?

36:31.863 --> 36:34.693
Mm. I just think
he's holding something back.

36:34.783 --> 36:36.214
[Robertson]: Spare me
your woman's intuition.

36:36.304 --> 36:37.183
Go on.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.903
Go and check on
missing persons.

36:40.944 --> 36:42.144
One, two, three!

36:42.223 --> 36:43.814
Fuck off.

36:43.904 --> 36:44.784

Show me what you've got!

Face the front!

36:58.945 --> 37:01.585
Hey, Charlie.

37:01.664 --> 37:03.255
I'm doing my summer
job tonight.

37:03.345 --> 37:05.415
They need two folk on it.

37:05.505 --> 37:07.015
Aye?

37:07.105 --> 37:08.305
Funny, ain't it?

Wullie wanting you
out the window,

37:10.066 --> 37:12.105
you saying
you wanted to kill him,

37:12.186 --> 37:14.066
and him disappearing.

37:15.106 --> 37:16.016
What are you saying?

37:16.105 --> 37:18.256
- It's funny.
- What's funny?

37:18.346 --> 37:20.945
You'll come tonight.

37:21.026 --> 37:23.016
The fair's in town.

All the fun of the fair.

37:41.226 --> 37:44.297
Step right up.
Tighten your seatbelts.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.537
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

37:49.467 --> 37:52.108
Try and look as if
you're having a great time.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.178
We're trying to
attract punters here.

37:54.268 --> 37:57.787
See, the thing is,
I need to be chummed-up,

37:57.868 --> 38:00.258
otherwise, I look like
one of the paedophiles.

38:00.348 --> 38:04.498
[Barney]: Do we no just
look like two paedophiles?

38:04.589 --> 38:07.628
[Charlie]: Ahh. Right enough.

38:12.548 --> 38:16.099
Remember, we went
to the circus last year?

38:16.189 --> 38:18.099
I like fairgrounds.
I hate circuses.

38:18.189 --> 38:20.709
Clowns should be tortured.

38:20.789 --> 38:22.589
And as for mimes...

38:22.670 --> 38:24.579
I'd strangle the bastards.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.629
Uh, two hotdogs,
with onions.

38:26.710 --> 38:28.539

38:35.470 --> 38:37.940
Listen, Charlie, come here.

38:38.030 --> 38:41.101
I was thinking. Um...

38:41.190 --> 38:44.470
You see, all that talk
the other day, up at yours,

38:44.550 --> 38:46.351
it was just talk.

38:46.430 --> 38:48.791
I know. I know.
I know!

38:48.871 --> 38:52.231
I helped you put
that bag in your car.

38:53.271 --> 38:54.591
What?

38:54.671 --> 38:57.821
That was the last night
Wullie was seen, was it no?

38:57.911 --> 38:59.871
Fuck off. W--

38:59.951 --> 39:01.101
I didn't kill Wullie!

39:01.191 --> 39:02.701
No. No, I know that.

39:02.791 --> 39:03.941
I'm just saying.

39:04.032 --> 39:05.101
And a big Coke!

39:05.191 --> 39:06.992
Barney's paying.

39:07.071 --> 39:08.982
Aren't you, Barney?

39:09.071 --> 39:10.472
Fuck off!

39:10.552 --> 39:11.752
I don't even know

39:11.832 --> 39:13.312
why I fucking bother
hanging about with you.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.902
Look at the state of you.

39:14.992 --> 39:17.112
Mental bastard.

39:22.513 --> 39:24.823
Shouldnae have said that.

39:36.393 --> 39:38.543

away for the day, boys.

39:38.634 --> 39:40.354

39:40.433 --> 39:41.753
I'm taking her
to the doctor's,

39:41.834 --> 39:43.633
see if he can give her
something to knock her out.

39:43.714 --> 39:47.594
I'm gonnae kick his arse
from here to fuckin' doomsday.

[door bell jingles]

39:50.994 --> 39:54.114
[radio playing softly]

39:54.195 --> 39:56.154
Maybe a wee
online gambling habit

39:56.234 --> 39:57.144
that got out of hand?

39:57.235 --> 39:59.305
You think?

39:59.395 --> 40:01.275
Och, I don't know.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.515
You could be onto
something there.

40:05.594 --> 40:06.585
Right enough.

40:06.675 --> 40:09.115
Wullie's mad keen
on the boxing.

40:09.195 --> 40:11.025
Enjoys the odd flutter.

40:11.115 --> 40:12.466
[Bell jingles]

40:12.556 --> 40:15.225
Maybe somebody's after him...

40:15.315 --> 40:17.225
Maybe he's taken to the hills.

40:17.316 --> 40:18.825
You know...

40:18.916 --> 40:20.586
you may have hit on
something--

40:20.676 --> 40:23.426
Gah. What's this
about a free haircut?

40:23.516 --> 40:25.796
Mind. Ye said.

40:25.876 --> 40:28.266
We're about to close up.

40:28.357 --> 40:29.786
Just get on with it.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.836
[Chris]: Free haircut, eh?

40:41.877 --> 40:43.027
Just said to him,
last week,

40:43.117 --> 40:45.997
I thought he could maybe
do with a wee trim.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.397
Eh, Charlie?

40:47.477 --> 40:49.757
That's unusually
generous of you, Barney.

40:50.957 --> 40:52.157
I'll tell you what.

40:52.237 --> 40:54.467
Uh, you head off.
I'll lock up.

40:54.558 --> 40:57.278
Away and see
your girlfriend, eh?

40:59.038 --> 41:02.078
What the hell am I
gonna do with this?

41:02.158 --> 41:04.358
[Charlie]: Where's Wullie?
On his holidays?

41:04.438 --> 41:06.558
[Barney]: Could be,
Charlie, could be.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.069
Is that why
you needed my help

41:08.159 --> 41:10.038
with that stuff
on Wednesday?

41:10.119 --> 41:11.319
[Forced chuckle]

41:11.398 --> 41:13.838
Cannot think
what you're on about.

41:13.919 --> 41:15.719
Uh, away ye go, Chris.

41:15.798 --> 41:17.469

might get burnt

41:25.079 --> 41:26.360
[Barney]: Well...

41:26.439 --> 41:28.640
Wullie and I
did the tidy-up,

41:28.719 --> 41:30.120
and I took the rubbish out.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.600

41:31.680 --> 41:33.960
but there--
there was chemicals.

I thought
you were leaving.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.720
[Charlie]: You couldnae lift it
by yourself, eh, Barney!

41:37.800 --> 41:39.150
It was massive.
Massive!

41:39.240 --> 41:43.921
Just shut up, Charlie!
Look, just let me do your hair.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.880
[Chris]: That's him done.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.441
[Barney]: No, no, look--

41:46.520 --> 41:48.400
[Chris, snaps]: He's done.

Another time, Charlie, eh?

this "massive bag"

42:25.723 --> 42:28.323
that took two
of you's to lift?

Cut a lot of heavy hair
on Wednesday?

[Barney, chuckles dryly]
Well, it seemed like it.

42:33.323 --> 42:35.314
[Chris]: Did you kill Wullie?

42:37.083 --> 42:39.364
What?

42:46.923 --> 42:49.364
You killed Wullie.

42:49.444 --> 42:51.434
Didn't you?

42:54.764 --> 42:57.325
It was an accident.

42:57.404 --> 42:59.444
You are so fucked.

42:59.524 --> 43:01.035
No, no, no, no.

I'm not bloody well
taking this

43:02.405 --> 43:03.964
off the likes
of you anyway.

43:04.045 --> 43:05.194
You're come swanning
in here every morning,

43:05.284 --> 43:06.274
half an hour late,

43:06.365 --> 43:07.874
then you spend
the rest of the day

43:07.965 --> 43:09.845
on that phone with
some stupid wee lassie.

43:09.925 --> 43:11.756
Have ye ever thought who pays
for these phone calls?

43:11.845 --> 43:12.725
Have ye? Eh?

43:12.805 --> 43:13.715
No.

43:13.805 --> 43:14.925
You make me bloody sick.

43:20.646 --> 43:22.075
And it was an accident.

- Oh.

44:51.331 --> 44:53.130
Mum, wh-where are you going?

44:53.211 --> 44:55.121
I told you,
my trip with the girls!

44:55.211 --> 44:56.171
They'll pick you up
from anywhere

44:56.251 --> 44:58.001
if you give them
advance warning.

44:58.091 --> 45:00.561
Och, two days
of indulgent bliss.

45:00.651 --> 45:01.882
I cannot wait.

45:01.971 --> 45:03.091
I need your help.

45:03.171 --> 45:04.402
Och...

45:04.492 --> 45:06.881
Talk to me through the door.

45:06.971 --> 45:08.171
[Barney]: Okay.

45:10.772 --> 45:12.602
Well...

45:12.691 --> 45:16.212
there's been another...
wee accident.

45:16.292 --> 45:17.642
[Cemolina]: What? Hey?

45:19.452 --> 45:22.202
Speak up!
I cannae hear you!

45:22.293 --> 45:23.572
What are you saying?

45:24.573 --> 45:26.932
I cannae hear you!

45:28.413 --> 45:29.972
Is this the queue?

45:31.852 --> 45:33.843
[Barney, stammers]
It's the ladies.

45:39.293 --> 45:41.124
[Holdall]: All right,
Mr. Thomson?

45:41.214 --> 45:43.093
[Barney]: H-How did you...

45:43.174 --> 45:45.644
[MacPherson]: We followed you.

45:45.734 --> 45:47.244
[Holdall]: Just as well
we turned up when we did.

45:47.334 --> 45:49.133
Aye?

45:49.214 --> 45:50.724
Yeah, well,
you was driving away

45:50.814 --> 45:52.774
when we was coming
round the corner.

45:52.854 --> 45:53.734
[chuckling awkwardly]

45:53.814 --> 45:54.774
Oh, really.

45:54.854 --> 45:55.894
It's funny how that--

45:55.974 --> 45:57.124
I need to ask you
a few more questions

45:57.214 --> 45:59.654
about Mr. Henderson.

45:59.734 --> 46:00.884
Now, what can you tell me

46:00.974 --> 46:02.884
about associates
he might have.

46:05.894 --> 46:07.455
He was a gambler.

46:07.535 --> 46:09.525
He-he was a gambler.

46:09.615 --> 46:11.125
That's right, yeah.

46:11.215 --> 46:13.365
You know, he was always
going tae boxing matches

46:13.455 --> 46:14.445
and casinos,

46:14.535 --> 46:18.165
and that--
that kind of thing.

46:18.255 --> 46:21.616
You know,
he actually owed

46:21.695 --> 46:24.366
quite a lot of money.

46:24.456 --> 46:26.736
Come tae think of it,

46:26.816 --> 46:30.576
he was in
a bit of trouble.

46:32.776 --> 46:37.326
Are you going
on your holidays?

46:39.016 --> 46:41.687
Oh, no, no,
that's my mum's.

46:41.776 --> 46:42.657
There's a coach trip.

46:42.736 --> 46:43.967
[Holdall]: Oh.

46:44.056 --> 46:45.177
I'm just here to make sure
she gets off safely.

46:45.257 --> 46:46.897
[toilet flushing,
Cemolina groans]

46:46.977 --> 46:47.887
Mum?

46:49.777 --> 46:51.418
Anyway, you got to look out
for your mum, eh?

46:51.497 --> 46:52.377
Yeah.

46:52.457 --> 46:53.418
She'd do anything for me.

46:53.497 --> 46:54.377
Oh...

46:54.457 --> 46:56.528
Anything at all.

46:58.977 --> 47:00.858
Hi, Mum.

47:02.138 --> 47:04.288
I'd give it
a couple of minutes.

47:06.058 --> 47:07.568
Thanks very much.

47:09.018 --> 47:11.488
Ooh, ooh, pull back
there, Neddy.

47:11.578 --> 47:13.858
Now, do you know

47:13.938 --> 47:15.499
if Mr. Henderson had
any dealings

47:15.578 --> 47:17.809
with a Stephen Murphy,

47:17.899 --> 47:18.778
John Murter,

47:18.859 --> 47:20.579
Richard Colquhoun,

47:20.658 --> 47:23.569
or a Robert Dodds?

47:23.659 --> 47:26.099
Wait a minute,
that's they murdered folk.

47:26.179 --> 47:28.409
I had absolutely fuck all
to do with that.

47:28.499 --> 47:29.779
This is harassment!

47:29.860 --> 47:31.139
I had absolutely nothing
to do with that,

47:31.219 --> 47:33.449
and there's nothing you can say
to prove otherwise.

47:33.539 --> 47:34.820
[groaning]

47:34.900 --> 47:36.490
Mum! Mum!

47:36.579 --> 47:39.220
Mum! Mum, you okay?

47:39.300 --> 47:40.529
[groaning and moaning]

47:40.620 --> 47:41.530
You all right?

47:41.620 --> 47:43.530
Come and have a seat.

47:43.620 --> 47:44.530
[moaning]

47:44.620 --> 47:45.500
Have a seat.

47:45.580 --> 47:46.490
Come here.

47:47.620 --> 47:48.531
There we are.

47:48.621 --> 47:50.901
[coughing and moaning]

47:52.140 --> 47:53.261
Are you okay?

47:53.340 --> 47:54.851
Mum...

47:56.300 --> 47:57.581
[MacPherson]:
We can help you take her

47:57.661 --> 47:58.941
up to the hospital
if you like.

47:59.021 --> 48:00.421
No, she's fine.

48:00.501 --> 48:01.981
Best leave us to it, eh?

48:02.061 --> 48:03.781
She doesn't look fine.

48:03.861 --> 48:04.822
Well, it happens
all the time!

48:04.901 --> 48:06.461
Just...

48:06.541 --> 48:08.372
I'm better on my own.

48:08.461 --> 48:11.102
You come down to the station

48:11.181 --> 48:14.142
and make a list of all
Mr. Henderson's known associates

48:14.222 --> 48:15.812
over the past six months.

48:15.902 --> 48:18.132
And I want an account

48:18.222 --> 48:21.452
of your whereabouts
for the last week.

48:21.542 --> 48:22.663
Uh-huh.

48:22.742 --> 48:23.782
Okay.

48:27.822 --> 48:28.783
Mum, you okay?

48:31.343 --> 48:32.693
Christ.

48:34.223 --> 48:35.973
Mum, do you want
an ambulance?

48:36.062 --> 48:37.943
Just get
my fucking case.

48:38.023 --> 48:41.783
But, Mum, see,
these others, it wasnae me.

48:41.863 --> 48:44.014
It had nothing to do with me.

48:44.103 --> 48:46.543
You need to believe me.

48:48.943 --> 48:52.734
[bus engine idling]

[bus radio blares]

48:54.664 --> 48:56.494
Oh, God.

48:56.584 --> 48:57.704
Ooh!

48:57.784 --> 48:58.904
Ha!

48:58.984 --> 48:59.894
[laughing]

48:59.984 --> 49:01.464
[all cheering]

49:01.544 --> 49:02.974
Oh! I'm here.

49:03.064 --> 49:03.944
Oh, God.

49:04.025 --> 49:05.774
Here, guess who's coming?

49:05.864 --> 49:08.745
Aye, just for a wee bit
of discovery, eh?

49:08.825 --> 49:10.495
[bus radio blaring]

49:16.745 --> 49:20.135
I didn't win
a fucking thing that night.

49:20.225 --> 49:21.186
[laughs]

49:21.265 --> 49:23.416
Mum! Mummy!

49:23.505 --> 49:25.735
Mum! It wasn't me.

49:25.826 --> 49:27.896
The others
they were talking about,

49:27.986 --> 49:28.865
I had nothing to do with that.

49:28.946 --> 49:32.066
Fuck off.

49:32.146 --> 49:33.946
Mum, it wasnae me!

49:34.026 --> 49:35.986
Mum!

50:06.708 --> 50:08.988
Is it?

50:09.068 --> 50:10.109
Have you been here
since the party?

50:10.188 --> 50:11.228
[giggles]

50:11.309 --> 50:14.059
Come on, I'll take you back.

50:14.148 --> 50:16.669
I'll just go
to the toilet first, son.

50:16.748 --> 50:18.739
No, no, no, no!

50:18.828 --> 50:21.549

50:21.629 --> 50:23.429

54:02.761 --> 54:04.881
"Mature woman looking for
unbridled passion?"

54:10.401 --> 54:12.392
Do you mind saying that
again in English, sir?

54:12.482 --> 54:15.122
I can't understand
a word you're saying.

54:15.201 --> 54:17.402
Yeah, I realize you're Scottish.

54:17.481 --> 54:18.801
I know I'm up here.

54:18.882 --> 54:21.482
Why are you here?

54:21.562 --> 54:22.712
Thomson told us

54:22.802 --> 54:24.602
Henderson had
a gambling problem,

54:24.683 --> 54:25.673
and he was in a lot of debt.

54:25.762 --> 54:26.992
Now, I've just spoken
to six bookies

54:27.083 --> 54:28.512
from the local area,

54:28.602 --> 54:30.403
and not one of them has said
that Henderson bothered him.

54:30.482 --> 54:32.792
So, that means
Thomson's lying, right?

54:32.882 --> 54:36.113
He's turning shitting himself
into an art form.

54:36.203 --> 54:37.113
Yeah, well, I'd shit myself

54:37.203 --> 54:38.113
if every time I turned round,

54:38.203 --> 54:39.843
I saw your fucking
big cockney face

54:39.923 --> 54:40.883
staring back at me.

54:42.363 --> 54:45.164
Just-- forget Barney Thomson!

54:45.243 --> 54:47.073
This is not
a barber-based crime!

54:47.164 --> 54:48.753
And give me the phone.

54:48.843 --> 54:50.753
Get out there and check on
the missing persons

54:50.843 --> 54:52.563
like I ordered you to!

54:54.563 --> 54:55.604
Give me my phone back.

54:55.684 --> 54:56.564
I need it.

54:56.644 --> 54:59.684
You've got your own phone.

55:01.084 --> 55:03.444
I need two.

55:05.884 --> 55:07.204
[seething angrily]

55:08.965 --> 55:10.635
[muttering in rage]

55:12.404 --> 55:14.605
Sir!

55:14.685 --> 55:16.355
We've just had
a report in,

55:16.445 --> 55:18.195
another missing person.

55:18.285 --> 55:19.795
Fuck 'em.

55:19.885 --> 55:21.715
Sir, it's one of
the other barbers.

55:21.805 --> 55:24.085
From that same barbershop.

55:24.166 --> 55:27.156
That guy called Porter.

55:27.246 --> 55:28.756
Well.

55:31.086 --> 55:34.716
Have you mentioned this
to Strap-One-On Robertson?

55:34.806 --> 55:38.406
I was just about
to tell her, sir.

55:38.486 --> 55:40.286
Good.

55:40.367 --> 55:42.276
Right, son,

55:42.367 --> 55:46.807
let's go and interview
the demon barber of Bridgeton.

56:36.289 --> 56:40.169
<i>The next train to depart
from the rear of Platform 5</i>

56:40.250 --> 56:44.800

<i>calling at Barrhead, Dunlop,</i>

56:47.810 --> 56:50.960
<i>Stewarton, Kilmaurs, Kilmarnock,</i>

56:51.050 --> 56:53.490
<i>Troon, Prestwick
International Airport...</i>

57:05.291 --> 57:07.201
No. No sign.

57:07.291 --> 57:09.601
Well, he's probably
up in Arbroath,

57:09.691 --> 57:14.082
posting Porter's balls
to his auntie.

57:14.171 --> 57:17.402
Let's check out Porter's flat.

57:17.492 --> 57:18.722
Come on.

57:52.974 --> 57:54.454
[gasping]

57:57.094 --> 57:58.214
Right.

58:04.535 --> 58:05.884
Right.

58:06.894 --> 58:11.445
I had no idea, officer.

58:11.534 --> 58:14.494
I'm absolutely stunned.

58:14.575 --> 58:15.805
Mind you,

58:15.895 --> 58:19.935
the dark side of Chris
was never too far away.

58:20.015 --> 58:21.365
He was always, um,

58:21.455 --> 58:23.095
flipping his razor out,

58:23.175 --> 58:24.166
rubbing his self up and down

58:24.255 --> 58:25.535
against the back
of the barber's chair,

58:25.615 --> 58:27.976
you know, that kind of...
that kind of thing.

58:28.055 --> 58:30.415
You know, if you ask me,

58:30.496 --> 58:34.695
I think his childhood
had a part in all of this.

58:34.776 --> 58:36.736
You know that his mother
used to, uh,

58:36.816 --> 58:38.406
lock him in the bunker,

58:38.496 --> 58:40.136
throw in a boiled egg
now and again.

58:40.216 --> 58:41.257
Get him out,

58:41.336 --> 58:42.486
dress him up
in one of her nighties,

58:42.577 --> 58:46.776
and get him to dance
for his Uncle Gerald.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.087
Now...

58:48.177 --> 58:50.087
does that sound normal to you?

58:51.097 --> 58:52.007
Ah.

58:53.137 --> 58:56.847
I have no idea
where he could be.

58:56.937 --> 59:00.647
I mean,
there was a friend in Lewisham,

59:00.737 --> 59:03.937
but, uh, why would he go there?

59:04.018 --> 59:06.978
Right. The freezer.

59:18.899 --> 59:21.539
What the fuck?

59:28.018 --> 59:29.769
You're that copper
off the telly!

59:29.859 --> 59:31.209
You're Taggart.

59:31.299 --> 59:32.859
You're off The Bill?

59:32.939 --> 59:33.819
You're a loser.

59:33.899 --> 59:34.779

59:34.859 --> 59:36.770

you're shite, Taggart.

59:40.460 --> 59:42.420
Fuck off!

59:42.499 --> 59:44.250
He killed them,

59:44.340 --> 59:46.779
then he put them in the bin.

59:46.860 --> 59:49.420
He put them in the bin,
because...

59:49.500 --> 59:52.331
he was...

59:52.420 --> 59:54.170
awfully tidy.

59:57.100 --> 59:58.690
Ah, fuck.

59:58.781 --> 1:00:01.090
Fucking little sweaty socks.

1:00:04.060 --> 1:00:06.971
He fuckin' boiled them.

1:00:07.061 --> 1:00:10.531
He cut them up
and he fuckin' boiled them.

1:00:12.141 --> 1:00:13.341
[knock on door]

1:00:18.102 --> 1:00:20.222
[knock on door]

1:00:21.381 --> 1:00:24.692
[knocking continues]

1:00:24.782 --> 1:00:25.742
[pounding]

1:00:31.742 --> 1:00:32.703
You don't think we should
check with Robertson

1:00:32.782 --> 1:00:35.062
about a warrant, sir?

1:00:35.143 --> 1:00:38.343
Radio reception
round here is shocking.

1:00:54.904 --> 1:00:56.334
[Man]: What are you
doing in there,

1:00:56.424 --> 1:00:57.574
ya dirty wee bastard?

1:00:57.663 --> 1:00:58.574
What?

1:00:58.664 --> 1:00:59.654
Yer at it, aren't ye?

1:00:59.744 --> 1:01:02.184
With one of
yer dirty wee lassies.

1:01:02.264 --> 1:01:03.144
Where is she?

1:01:03.224 --> 1:01:05.104
Ya dirty,
dirty wee bastard.

1:01:05.184 --> 1:01:06.304
What the fuck?

1:01:06.384 --> 1:01:08.854
[Neighbour]:
Ya dirty, dirty wee bastard.

1:01:08.944 --> 1:01:10.094
Are ya doin' it right now?

1:01:10.184 --> 1:01:12.015
Show me, show me.

1:01:14.065 --> 1:01:15.895
Do ye want to watch?

1:01:15.985 --> 1:01:18.265
'Cause we're doin' it
right now.

1:01:18.345 --> 1:01:19.985
Come, come closer and see.

1:01:20.065 --> 1:01:21.545
Oh, aye?

1:01:28.385 --> 1:01:30.345
[MacPherson]: Sir?

1:01:32.785 --> 1:01:35.065
The fuck?

1:01:35.146 --> 1:01:36.706
What is that?

1:01:43.587 --> 1:01:45.706
Oh, I think we've hit the jackpot here.

1:01:48.186 --> 1:01:49.987
That's handy.

1:01:53.627 --> 1:01:57.467
[neighbour muttering]

1:02:02.147 --> 1:02:04.978
[Neighbour]:
You dirty, dirty bastard.

1:02:06.547 --> 1:02:08.777
Fuck you, Robertson.

1:02:12.827 --> 1:02:16.458
[Robertson]: I will have
your arse for disobeying orders!

1:02:16.548 --> 1:02:17.828
We couldn't reach you.

1:02:17.908 --> 1:02:19.898
We thought maybe
you'd gone deep cover.

1:02:19.988 --> 1:02:21.738
In a boys' school's shower.

1:02:21.828 --> 1:02:23.059
Don't you fucking start--

1:02:23.148 --> 1:02:24.029
[MacPherson]: Look!

1:02:24.108 --> 1:02:25.098
There's a piece of each victims,

1:02:25.188 --> 1:02:26.469
some represented
more than others.

1:02:26.549 --> 1:02:28.108
There's also a receipt
for a train ticket--

1:02:28.189 --> 1:02:29.588
Glasgow to London.

1:02:29.669 --> 1:02:31.499
Filed a report yet?
Hey? Hey?

1:02:31.588 --> 1:02:32.869
Well, I'll take it from here.

1:02:32.949 --> 1:02:34.699
As of now, off you fuck.

1:02:36.429 --> 1:02:37.309
[James]: Nae Wullie.

1:02:37.389 --> 1:02:39.509
Now nae Chris.

1:02:39.590 --> 1:02:42.980
[Barney]: Well, Chris likes
a Friday night.

1:02:43.070 --> 1:02:46.189
Probably lying
in his own piss somewhere.

1:02:46.270 --> 1:02:48.550
[James]: It's the middle
of the week.

1:02:48.630 --> 1:02:51.430
[entry bell jingles]

1:02:51.510 --> 1:02:53.580
Barney Thomson?

1:02:54.910 --> 1:02:57.580
We need to contact him
very urgently,

1:02:57.671 --> 1:03:00.580
so, you know,
if you could...

1:03:00.670 --> 1:03:02.021
He rubbed his self

1:03:02.111 --> 1:03:03.341
up against the back
of the barber chair.

1:03:03.431 --> 1:03:05.020
Oh...

1:03:05.111 --> 1:03:06.231
And he had a cousin

1:03:06.311 --> 1:03:07.871
in Lewisham,

1:03:07.951 --> 1:03:09.020
in London.

1:03:09.111 --> 1:03:11.391
So, what was your
last contact with him?

1:03:12.671 --> 1:03:13.821
[dogs barking]

1:03:13.912 --> 1:03:16.032
[Barney, stammering]
Just normal, you know.

1:03:16.111 --> 1:03:17.781
He left.

1:03:17.871 --> 1:03:19.271
Uh...

1:03:19.352 --> 1:03:20.231
I tidied up,

1:03:20.312 --> 1:03:22.592
and everything was just...

1:03:22.672 --> 1:03:24.152
perfectly normal.

1:03:25.352 --> 1:03:27.422
Yeah. Okay.

1:03:27.512 --> 1:03:29.232
That's fine, Mr. Thomson.

1:03:29.312 --> 1:03:30.192
So if you could, uh,

1:03:30.272 --> 1:03:32.742
send in
Mr. Henderson, please.

1:03:32.832 --> 1:03:34.632
Okay.

1:03:34.712 --> 1:03:35.993
[dogs barking excitedly]

1:03:36.072 --> 1:03:38.633
Hey. Hey...

1:03:38.712 --> 1:03:41.353
Shoo. Shoo!
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

1:03:41.433 --> 1:03:42.313
Go! Well, don't.

1:03:42.393 --> 1:03:43.353
Just, fuck off!

1:03:43.433 --> 1:03:44.313
Fuck off, dog!

1:03:44.393 --> 1:03:45.623
Don't-- Get fucked.

1:03:45.713 --> 1:03:47.223
Just beat it.

1:03:47.313 --> 1:03:48.273
Fuckin'....

1:03:48.353 --> 1:03:51.263
[dogs barking]

1:03:51.353 --> 1:03:52.553
Well--

1:03:52.633 --> 1:03:55.104
So, that's that, then.

1:03:55.193 --> 1:03:56.103
My laddie's deid.

1:03:56.194 --> 1:03:58.584
[dogs barking outside]

1:03:58.673 --> 1:04:00.984
I'm afraid so, Mr. Henderson.

1:04:03.194 --> 1:04:04.914
If you'd like to accompany us
to the station,

1:04:04.994 --> 1:04:07.514
we can fill you in
on the details that we have

1:04:07.594 --> 1:04:09.344
up to this point.

1:04:09.434 --> 1:04:10.754
Nah, you're all right.

1:04:12.435 --> 1:04:15.185
I've got a couple of regulars
coming in an hour.

1:04:15.275 --> 1:04:18.234
Life must go on, eh?

1:04:20.275 --> 1:04:22.315
[dog barking]

1:04:22.395 --> 1:04:24.065
[Cemolina]: Bye, girls!

1:04:24.155 --> 1:04:25.716
See you's at the bingo!

1:04:25.795 --> 1:04:27.625
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1:04:27.716 --> 1:04:29.675
[laughs]

1:04:29.755 --> 1:04:32.315
I know
what you've fucking done!

1:04:32.396 --> 1:04:34.306
[Cemolina]:
Less of the language.

1:04:35.675 --> 1:04:38.116
Know what?

1:04:38.195 --> 1:04:40.236
I've been in your flat.

1:04:40.316 --> 1:04:42.836
What the hell were you doing
in my flat?

1:04:42.916 --> 1:04:45.067
There's been another accident.

1:04:45.156 --> 1:04:46.197
Oh, God.

1:04:46.276 --> 1:04:47.996
Who is it this time?

1:04:48.077 --> 1:04:49.907
- Chris.
- Chris? Chris who?

1:04:49.996 --> 1:04:50.986
The other fucking barber!

1:04:51.076 --> 1:04:53.517
Ooh, well done.

1:04:53.596 --> 1:04:55.397
I've been in your freezer.

1:04:55.476 --> 1:04:57.627
You're that body parts killer.

1:04:57.717 --> 1:04:59.517
I know.

1:05:00.797 --> 1:05:02.677
What have you got in there?

1:05:02.757 --> 1:05:04.908
Your pals.

1:05:07.037 --> 1:05:08.917
Get in the fucking car.

1:05:11.758 --> 1:05:13.878
What the hell
are you playing at?

1:05:13.958 --> 1:05:15.437
Eh?

1:05:15.518 --> 1:05:17.668
Have you been
driving around with--

1:05:17.758 --> 1:05:19.268
You cannae keep them in the car!

1:05:19.358 --> 1:05:20.558
Are you mental?

1:05:20.638 --> 1:05:23.199
Look, I wanted to plant
them in Chris's flat

1:05:23.278 --> 1:05:25.238
and make it look like
he was the killer,

1:05:25.319 --> 1:05:26.908
but he's got a wee freezer.

1:05:26.998 --> 1:05:28.349
What?

1:05:28.438 --> 1:05:30.399
His freezer's too wee!

1:05:31.798 --> 1:05:34.109
His freezer's too fuckin' wee!

1:05:34.198 --> 1:05:37.509
Would you just
listen to yourself?

1:05:39.879 --> 1:05:44.239
I never saw
the fuckin' point of you.

1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:52.030
Chris Porter, last seen
by Barney Thomson

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:53.160
on Monday evening

1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:54.910
when he left
Henderson's barbershop.

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.430
His girlfriend
reported him missing

1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:58.080
the following afternoon.

1:05:58.161 --> 1:06:00.631
Under my instruction,

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:03.790
DI Holdall and DS MacPherson
were sent on a routine check

1:06:03.881 --> 1:06:05.390
to the individual's flat,

1:06:05.481 --> 1:06:07.551
where they found
several body parts,

1:06:07.641 --> 1:06:08.601
which I believe
to be connected

1:06:08.681 --> 1:06:10.591
to the serial killer's
victims.

1:06:10.681 --> 1:06:12.161
We're just waiting
on pathology

1:06:12.241 --> 1:06:13.121
for confirmation.

1:06:13.201 --> 1:06:14.631
We also discovered a receipt

1:06:14.721 --> 1:06:17.161
for a train ticket to London
the previous day.

1:06:17.241 --> 1:06:20.682
[McManaman]:
Anything to add, 127?

1:06:20.762 --> 1:06:21.912
[Holdall]:
It's too clean, sir.

1:06:22.002 --> 1:06:24.752
It's like the evidence
was laid on for us.

1:06:24.841 --> 1:06:27.722
Now, there are follow-ups
I'd like to instigate

1:06:27.801 --> 1:06:29.032
before we go public.

1:06:29.122 --> 1:06:30.842
Barney Thomson?

1:06:30.922 --> 1:06:32.482
You're obsessed.

1:06:32.562 --> 1:06:34.442
I talked to the man
yesterday.

1:06:34.522 --> 1:06:36.642
You know where he was
when Henderson went missing?

1:06:36.723 --> 1:06:38.682
The bingo.

1:06:38.763 --> 1:06:41.233
Does that sound like
a crazed serial killer to you?

1:06:41.322 --> 1:06:42.913
[knock on door]

1:06:43.003 --> 1:06:44.883
[McManaman]: Ah, Jenkins.

1:06:44.963 --> 1:06:47.273
I've just completed
the pathology report, sir.

1:06:47.363 --> 1:06:48.953
You have the floor.

1:06:49.043 --> 1:06:51.513
It couldn't have been Porter
who chopped up those bodies.

1:06:51.603 --> 1:06:54.354
It's normal for there to be
skin cells present

1:06:54.444 --> 1:06:56.433
on anything we touch,

1:06:56.523 --> 1:07:00.514
but with the vigorous
chop-chop-chopping,

1:07:00.604 --> 1:07:02.433
those would have been enhanced.

1:07:02.524 --> 1:07:06.434
These skin cells determine
the age of the assailant.

1:07:06.524 --> 1:07:09.045
I'd state in a court of law

1:07:09.124 --> 1:07:14.245
that this was done by someone
in their late 60s, early70s.

1:07:17.885 --> 1:07:19.555
Well, I'll be fucked.

1:07:21.644 --> 1:07:23.635
So Porter's got an accomplice.

1:07:23.725 --> 1:07:26.035
Exactly so, 119.

1:07:26.125 --> 1:07:30.486
And it isn't Thomson, 127.

1:07:30.565 --> 1:07:31.845
[Robertson]: Right,

1:07:31.926 --> 1:07:34.075
you will now interview
every old lag in Glasgow.

1:07:34.165 --> 1:07:36.235
Every last one.

1:07:36.326 --> 1:07:37.966
You go near Thomson again,

1:07:38.046 --> 1:07:39.796
I'll put you on traffic.

1:07:39.885 --> 1:07:42.716
Get out there
and find Porter's accomplice.

1:07:48.646 --> 1:07:50.287
[Barney]: Why did you do it?

1:07:50.366 --> 1:07:51.487
[Cemolina]: I don't know.

1:07:51.566 --> 1:07:52.917
You do it once,

1:07:53.006 --> 1:07:55.837
you sort of
get the bug for it.

1:07:55.927 --> 1:07:58.077
I can't explain,
it's like...

1:07:58.167 --> 1:07:59.997
you know you shouldn't,

1:08:00.087 --> 1:08:02.527
and that's part of
the kick, you know?

1:08:02.607 --> 1:08:03.957
Going on dates,

1:08:04.047 --> 1:08:05.797
you never knew what
you were going to get.

1:08:05.887 --> 1:08:07.527
[Barney]: Fuckin' hell.

1:08:07.607 --> 1:08:09.518
Well, what do you
want me to say?

1:08:09.608 --> 1:08:11.487
"Sorry?"

1:08:11.568 --> 1:08:13.127
It's noe as if I'm entirely
without compassion.

1:08:13.208 --> 1:08:16.198
I sent the relatives something
to remember them by.

1:08:16.288 --> 1:08:18.327
What, an arse?

1:08:18.408 --> 1:08:20.448
Get off my back.

1:08:26.768 --> 1:08:27.649
Did you kill Dad?

1:08:27.728 --> 1:08:29.009
Oh...

1:08:29.088 --> 1:08:31.448
[Barney]: You told me
he fucked off to Australia.

1:08:31.529 --> 1:08:33.278
I kept asking you why,

1:08:33.369 --> 1:08:34.719
and you couldnae give me
a straight answer.

1:08:34.808 --> 1:08:37.089
You couldnae
because you fucking killed him.

1:08:37.169 --> 1:08:39.129
Shite.

1:08:39.209 --> 1:08:40.359
I never told you

1:08:40.449 --> 1:08:42.839
because I knew you couldnae
handle the truth.

1:08:42.929 --> 1:08:45.289
So, what's the truth?

1:08:45.370 --> 1:08:48.089
He moved to Harthill
and opened a tobacconists.

1:08:49.250 --> 1:08:51.530
Harthill's only
five fucking miles away!

1:08:51.610 --> 1:08:53.410
See?
I knew you'd be like this.

1:08:53.490 --> 1:08:54.769
Well, why didn't he
keep in touch?

1:08:54.850 --> 1:08:56.440
[Cemolina]: Maybe he was just
like everybody else.

1:08:56.530 --> 1:08:59.490
Maybe he couldn't be fucking
bothered with you either.

1:09:04.210 --> 1:09:06.441
Know why?

1:09:06.531 --> 1:09:09.731
'Cause he wasn't your dad.

1:09:09.811 --> 1:09:11.641
What do you mean
he wasnae my dad?

1:09:11.731 --> 1:09:12.721
Him.

1:09:12.811 --> 1:09:14.771
That wee prick.
He wasnae your dad.

1:09:14.851 --> 1:09:15.921
What's the matter
with you?

1:09:16.011 --> 1:09:17.971
Well, who-who was my dad?

1:09:18.051 --> 1:09:19.801
"Who was my dad?"

1:09:19.891 --> 1:09:21.611
Who's my dad?

1:09:21.692 --> 1:09:23.042
- I don't bloody know.
- How no?

1:09:23.132 --> 1:09:24.962
"- How no?"
- How fucking no?

1:09:25.051 --> 1:09:26.251
[Cemolina]: I was a very busy
lady back then!

1:09:26.332 --> 1:09:27.842
I didn't know
any of the punters' names!

1:09:27.932 --> 1:09:29.001
I didn't want to know!

1:09:32.772 --> 1:09:33.972
Punters?

1:09:34.052 --> 1:09:35.283
As long as they paid up front,
I didn't care.

1:09:35.372 --> 1:09:36.932
I just pointed them
round the back,

1:09:37.012 --> 1:09:39.052
that way you don't have to look
at their fucking ugly faces.

1:09:39.132 --> 1:09:40.092
I had the Women's Realm

1:09:40.173 --> 1:09:41.322
spread out
on the chest of drawers,

1:09:41.412 --> 1:09:42.732
I'd be flicking
through that all day.

1:09:42.813 --> 1:09:44.483
That's what got you through.
Vermin, the lot of them.

1:09:44.573 --> 1:09:46.372
Don't you
look at me like that.

1:09:46.453 --> 1:09:47.773
You do anything to get by.

1:09:47.853 --> 1:09:50.243
Your granny, she had a place
above the butcher shop

1:09:50.333 --> 1:09:52.003
on London Road.

1:09:52.093 --> 1:09:54.003
It's one of the nail salons now.

1:09:54.093 --> 1:09:56.324
- Granny Beattie?
- Aye.

1:09:56.413 --> 1:09:57.454
Think what she had to do

1:09:57.533 --> 1:09:59.574
to keep you in fucking
Dolly Mixture.

1:09:59.653 --> 1:10:01.884
- Aw, Christ...
- What? That's life.

1:10:01.974 --> 1:10:02.853
Is it fuck!

1:10:02.934 --> 1:10:04.053
Oh, you would know,
would you?

1:10:04.134 --> 1:10:05.934
You, what, all the living
you've been doing.

1:10:06.014 --> 1:10:06.894
Look at you.

1:10:06.974 --> 1:10:07.804
Fuck's sake.

1:10:07.894 --> 1:10:09.454
I thought
I'd been careful.

1:10:09.534 --> 1:10:12.284
And one day, of course,
the inevitable happens,

1:10:12.374 --> 1:10:13.255
and here we are.

1:10:13.334 --> 1:10:16.055
Total fucking disaster.

1:10:16.134 --> 1:10:18.364
I kept meaning to tell you.

1:10:19.854 --> 1:10:21.415
You kept fucking
meaning to tell me, did you?

1:10:21.495 --> 1:10:23.725
You kept meaning to tell me?

1:10:23.815 --> 1:10:25.565
This is shite!

1:10:25.655 --> 1:10:26.855

1:10:29.175 --> 1:10:30.845
It's all a fucking
laugh to you.

1:10:30.935 --> 1:10:33.535
This is my fucking life here!

1:10:33.616 --> 1:10:35.815
This is shite.

1:10:35.896 --> 1:10:38.726
This is fuckin' shite.

1:10:58.377 --> 1:10:59.807

MacPherson.

1:15:03.310 --> 1:15:05.110
She's spent the last 40 years

1:15:05.191 --> 1:15:07.500

was for himself and the family.

1:19:48.325 --> 1:19:49.316
Says here that Chris

1:19:49.405 --> 1:19:50.605
might have went
to the Netherlands.

1:19:50.686 --> 1:19:51.646
They'll never catch him.

1:19:51.726 --> 1:19:54.087
Not a chance.

1:19:55.966 --> 1:19:58.087
I'm away for the barbers'
college tomorrow.

1:19:58.166 --> 1:20:00.727
Should have a couple
more staff by Monday.

1:20:02.046 --> 1:20:03.086
I'll make you head barber.

1:20:03.167 --> 1:20:05.077
Oh, right.

1:20:05.167 --> 1:20:07.556
Well, thanks, James.

1:20:07.647 --> 1:20:09.527
Thanks very much.

1:20:09.607 --> 1:20:10.517
[telephone rings]

1:20:10.607 --> 1:20:11.727
Bloody reporters.

1:20:11.807 --> 1:20:13.558
No, I'll get it.

1:20:15.368 --> 1:20:16.957
Henderson's.

1:20:17.047 --> 1:20:17.958
[Man]: <i>Barney Thomson?</i>

1:20:18.048 --> 1:20:19.447
Aye.

1:20:19.528 --> 1:20:22.408
<i>Maybe you'd better check on
that body you've dumped.</i>

1:20:23.768 --> 1:20:24.728
Who is this?

1:20:27.208 --> 1:20:30.038
Who--Who is this?

1:20:41.528 --> 1:20:43.519
[Holdall]: Here we go.

1:20:43.609 --> 1:20:45.249
Tell me the mother's
name again.

1:20:46.329 --> 1:20:48.159
[MacPherson]: Cemolina.

1:20:48.249 --> 1:20:51.209
[Holdall]: That's the most
ridiculous name I've ever heard.

1:20:51.290 --> 1:20:53.729
[MacPherson]: She'd been running
a lonely hearts ad.

1:20:53.810 --> 1:20:55.209
I checked
the P.O. box, right?

1:20:55.290 --> 1:20:56.440
Several replies.

1:20:56.529 --> 1:20:58.650
So that's how the fucker
picked his victims.

1:20:58.730 --> 1:20:59.640
Yeah, you were right, sir.

1:20:59.730 --> 1:21:00.720
She was the one
posting the limbs

1:21:00.809 --> 1:21:02.210
out on the coach tours.

1:21:02.289 --> 1:21:04.170
All the dates,
they all match.

1:21:04.250 --> 1:21:05.920
What mothers will do
for their sons.

1:21:06.010 --> 1:21:06.971
Yeah.

1:21:07.050 --> 1:21:08.120
Come on.

1:21:10.890 --> 1:21:13.561
- Don't lose him.
- Yeah.

1:21:33.972 --> 1:21:35.962
[twig crackles]

1:21:45.813 --> 1:21:46.772
[Robertson]:
Barney Thomson.

1:21:47.813 --> 1:21:49.013
I'm arresting you

1:21:49.092 --> 1:21:50.082
for the murder
of your colleagues,

1:21:50.172 --> 1:21:52.453
Chris Porter
and Wullie Henderson.

1:21:52.532 --> 1:21:54.523
And six other men
from the Glasgow area.

1:21:54.613 --> 1:21:56.893
Well, it's a wee bit
more complicated than that.

1:21:56.973 --> 1:21:58.293
Is this where you dumped
the body of Chris Porter?

1:21:58.373 --> 1:21:59.333
[Barney]: Well, I...

1:21:59.413 --> 1:22:00.613
What did you
come back here for?

1:22:00.694 --> 1:22:01.973
The phone call.

1:22:02.053 --> 1:22:02.963
[Robertson]: The phone call?

1:22:03.053 --> 1:22:05.444
[Holdall]: We phoned him.

1:22:06.974 --> 1:22:08.373
[Robertson]: Holdall.

1:22:08.454 --> 1:22:10.843
Great, you're just in time
to watch me make the arrest.

1:22:10.934 --> 1:22:13.084
The fuck are you doing here?

1:22:13.173 --> 1:22:14.974
[Holdall]: I could ask you
the same question.

1:22:15.054 --> 1:22:16.284
[Robertson]: We were tipped off
by Thomson's pal,

1:22:16.374 --> 1:22:18.204
Charlie Taylor.

1:22:18.294 --> 1:22:19.694
Great wee pal you've got
there, by the way.

1:22:19.774 --> 1:22:21.055
Fucker.

1:22:21.134 --> 1:22:22.124
[Robertson]: Just kept tabs
on him, and here we are.

1:22:22.214 --> 1:22:23.724
You know, it just
confirmed my belief

1:22:23.814 --> 1:22:25.934
that Thomson
was our man all along.

1:22:26.015 --> 1:22:27.765
[Holdall]: Yeah, bollocks.
I solved this case.

1:22:27.855 --> 1:22:28.895
Where the fuck were you?

1:22:28.974 --> 1:22:30.404
Playing with your fanny?

1:22:30.495 --> 1:22:31.615
[Robertson]:
It was a double bluff.

1:22:31.695 --> 1:22:33.255
I just wanted to let Thomson
off the hook

1:22:33.335 --> 1:22:35.085
so he'd make a mistake,
relax a wee bit,

1:22:35.175 --> 1:22:36.455
you know, fuck up?

1:22:36.535 --> 1:22:37.606
'Course you came along

1:22:37.695 --> 1:22:38.975
and nearly screwed
the whole thing up.

1:22:39.055 --> 1:22:41.575
DI Fuckwit and DS Debbie McGee.

1:22:41.656 --> 1:22:44.175
The only reason he's here

1:22:44.255 --> 1:22:46.295
is 'cause we tricked him
into checking on the body.

1:22:46.376 --> 1:22:47.936
Hey, I'll remember you

1:22:48.015 --> 1:22:49.656
when they promote me
to Chief Superintendent.

1:22:49.736 --> 1:22:51.016
[Jobson]: Maybe we'll let
you and your monkey

1:22:51.096 --> 1:22:52.496
do the security

1:22:52.576 --> 1:22:53.856
at some third division
football matches.

1:22:53.936 --> 1:22:55.336
[Holdall chuckles wryly]

1:22:55.416 --> 1:22:57.646
Be my guest.

1:22:59.617 --> 1:23:00.767
[Jobson]:
What do you want, monkey?

1:23:06.017 --> 1:23:07.057
Fuck's sake.

1:23:08.257 --> 1:23:09.167
Whoa!

1:23:09.257 --> 1:23:10.737
Guns. Well, I'm impressed.

1:23:10.817 --> 1:23:12.247
Ain't you, MacPherson?

1:23:12.337 --> 1:23:13.567
Oh, absolutely, sir.

1:23:13.657 --> 1:23:14.977
Arrest this pair of bastards.

1:23:16.258 --> 1:23:17.537
Oh, fuck...

1:23:17.617 --> 1:23:18.658
What are you doing with guns?

1:23:18.737 --> 1:23:19.808
What are <i>you</i>
doing with guns?

1:23:19.897 --> 1:23:20.938
We're on the trail
of a suspected killer.

1:23:21.017 --> 1:23:22.498
Of course we've got
fucking guns.

1:23:22.577 --> 1:23:23.648
Where did you get yours from?

1:23:23.738 --> 1:23:25.248
I signed them out.

1:23:25.338 --> 1:23:27.008
Oh, not without
my authorization.

1:23:27.098 --> 1:23:28.138
Excuse me, can I just--

1:23:28.218 --> 1:23:29.258
[all cocking guns]

1:23:29.338 --> 1:23:30.248
Okay.

1:23:30.338 --> 1:23:31.248
Okay...

1:23:31.338 --> 1:23:32.848
What form did you sign?

1:23:32.938 --> 1:23:34.368
Uh, blue D 14.

1:23:34.459 --> 1:23:36.768
Ha! You should have used
the new pink D 13!

1:23:36.859 --> 1:23:39.659
Well, nobody said anything
to me about a pink D 13.

1:23:39.738 --> 1:23:42.018
Oh, well, you obviously
didn't see the red C 24.

1:23:42.099 --> 1:23:43.499
Red?

1:23:43.579 --> 1:23:45.649
Add "incorrect form filling"
to the list of charges.

1:23:45.739 --> 1:23:47.139
This is fucking ridiculous.

1:23:47.219 --> 1:23:49.529
We're all supposed to be
on the same side here.

1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:51.100
All right, give us the guns,

1:23:51.179 --> 1:23:53.059
and I'll forget about
the assault charge.

1:23:53.139 --> 1:23:54.370
Yeah? Well, what about
the arrest report?

1:23:54.459 --> 1:23:56.370
Did you mention Barney Thomson
to anybody else?

1:23:56.460 --> 1:24:00.740
No. I just signed the guns out
for personal protection.

1:24:00.820 --> 1:24:01.970
Same here.

1:24:02.060 --> 1:24:03.290
Didn't want McManaman
telling you our plan.

1:24:03.380 --> 1:24:05.900
All right, we'll forget
about the arrest report.

1:24:05.980 --> 1:24:07.380
You just be thankful

1:24:07.460 --> 1:24:09.660
you're not going
to fucking jail!

1:24:09.740 --> 1:24:12.210
Thankful? I gave you
the fucking suspect, you tosser!

1:24:12.300 --> 1:24:13.730
Do you know what?

1:24:13.820 --> 1:24:15.301
I've fucking changed my mind.

1:24:15.380 --> 1:24:17.291
You're so fucking
shafted, Holdall!

1:24:17.380 --> 1:24:19.450
Just give me the gun!

1:24:19.541 --> 1:24:21.660
I'll give you the fucking gun!

1:24:21.741 --> 1:24:22.811
Oh, big man, is it?

1:24:22.901 --> 1:24:23.861
Yeah.

1:24:23.941 --> 1:24:25.261
You havenae
the fucking balls!

1:24:25.341 --> 1:24:27.061
[Holdall]: I'll fucking blow
your fucking head off.

1:24:28.862 --> 1:24:29.901
Oh!

1:24:29.981 --> 1:24:31.022
MacPherson!

1:24:31.101 --> 1:24:32.222
This is all your fault.

1:24:32.301 --> 1:24:33.262
You're a fucking maniac!

1:24:33.341 --> 1:24:34.301

1:24:34.381 --> 1:24:35.262

You thought all your birthdays
had come at once?

1:25:36.185 --> 1:25:38.095
Well, forget it.

1:25:38.185 --> 1:25:43.466
You are so fucked.

1:25:44.465 --> 1:25:48.666
See, I'm out of this.

1:25:49.825 --> 1:25:51.025
You did it.

1:25:53.025 --> 1:25:54.986
You know what I am?

1:25:55.066 --> 1:25:56.496
I'm a fucking hero.

1:25:57.906 --> 1:26:00.266
I solved the crime.

1:26:00.346 --> 1:26:04.387
I brought down
the master criminal.

1:26:04.466 --> 1:26:05.786
No. No, no, no.

1:26:05.867 --> 1:26:08.507
See, it wasnae me.

1:26:08.586 --> 1:26:11.707
I only killed Wullie and Chris.

1:26:11.786 --> 1:26:13.457
And they were accidents.

1:26:13.547 --> 1:26:16.217
And that's when
I went to my mum,

1:26:16.307 --> 1:26:17.867
and that's when
I found out the truth.

1:26:19.107 --> 1:26:21.417
You know, she...

1:26:21.508 --> 1:26:23.817
These men,

1:26:23.908 --> 1:26:27.948
they answered her ads
in the paper.

1:26:28.028 --> 1:26:30.628
Then she shagged them,

1:26:30.708 --> 1:26:31.618
then killed them,

1:26:31.708 --> 1:26:32.938
and fucking chopped them up,

1:26:33.028 --> 1:26:35.419
and I'm the spawn of a monster.

1:26:50.309 --> 1:26:52.510

1:26:52.589 --> 1:26:55.819
<i>the bodies had lain there
approximately one week,</i>

<i>and again, I stress,</i>

<i>[Female Reporter]:
Do you believe this incident</i>

<i>has anything to do with
the body parts killer?</i>

1:27:08.550 --> 1:27:11.590
[McManaman]: <i>The two cases
are completely unrelated.</i>

1:27:11.671 --> 1:27:13.230
<i>Completely.</i>

1:27:13.310 --> 1:27:15.951
<i>Chris Porter,
he's our body parts killer.</i>

1:27:16.030 --> 1:27:19.870
<i>Just a matter of time
before we track him down.</i>

[Male Reporter]:
<i>Is there any truth</i>

1:27:21.311 --> 1:27:22.511
<i>that the officers were meeting</i>

1:27:22.591 --> 1:27:24.340

[McManaman]: <i>Well...</i>

<i>I mean, we can't be sure
at this juncture,</i>

1:27:29.431 --> 1:27:33.271
<i>but it's-it's beginning
to look that way.</i>

1:27:33.352 --> 1:27:35.022
All right, who's next?

1:27:35.112 --> 1:27:36.622
[Barney, narrating]:
<i>"Ménage-à-trois"?</i>

<i>there's no such thing

1:29:14.357 --> 1:29:17.157
<i>Since I left my baby behind</i>

1:29:17.237 --> 1:29:22.398
<i>On Blue Bayou...</i>

1:29:22.477 --> 1:29:26.237
<i>Saving nickels
Saving dimes</i>

1:29:26.318 --> 1:29:30.108
<i>Working till
the sun don't shine</i>

1:29:30.198 --> 1:29:33.108
<i>Looking forward
to happier times</i>

1:29:33.198 --> 1:29:36.958
<i>On Blue Bayou</i>

1:29:37.039 --> 1:29:40.919
<i>I'm going back someday
come what may</i>

1:29:40.998 --> 1:29:44.989
<i>To Blue Bayou</i>

1:29:45.079 --> 1:29:48.838
<i>Where you sleep all day
and the catfish play</i>

1:29:48.919 --> 1:29:52.629
<i>On Blue Bayou...</i>

1:29:52.719 --> 1:29:54.629
<i>All those fishing boats</i>

1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:57.000
<i>With their sails afloat</i>

1:29:57.079 --> 1:30:00.469
<i>If I could only see...</i>

1:30:00.560 --> 1:30:02.950
For fuck's sake.

1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:08.120
We're off.

1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:10.670
[laughter]

1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:18.270
<i>...And to be with
some of my friends</i>

1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:21.481
<i>Maybe I'd be happy then</i>

1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:23.630
Oh, fuck it.

1:30:23.721 --> 1:30:25.841
What now?

1:30:25.921 --> 1:30:27.431
I'm going to have to
fish it out with a spoon.

1:30:27.521 --> 1:30:29.111
No, the fucking...

1:30:29.201 --> 1:30:31.801
[laughter]

1:30:34.041 --> 1:30:35.112
I'm so sorry.

1:30:40.122 --> 1:30:42.353
[laughter]

1:30:46.042 --> 1:30:48.082
[laughing]

1:30:51.282 --> 1:30:52.242
You stupid bitch.

1:30:52.323 --> 1:30:54.393
Evil bitch.

1:30:56.762 --> 1:31:01.602
<i>I'll never be blue
my dreams come true</i>

1:31:01.683 --> 1:31:06.123
<i>On Blue Bayou...</i>
