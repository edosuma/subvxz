WEBVTT

03:02.543 --> 03:06.945
Carlie, I'll do just one
more before the one after that.

03:10.483 --> 03:11.284
Carlie.

03:11.317 --> 03:12.452
Yeah, ignore me.

03:12.485 --> 03:13.386
That's just great.

03:20.392 --> 03:21.226
I'm Kevin.

03:22.126 --> 03:22.927
Sophy.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.795
Sophy.

03:24.663 --> 03:25.996
That's a pretty name.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.733
I do all right with it.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.100
Can I buy a drink?

03:29.133 --> 03:32.269
Thanks, but I'm
meeting someone.

03:32.303 --> 03:33.937
Someone.

03:33.970 --> 03:37.675
Boyfriend, husband?

03:37.708 --> 03:39.744
I'm not seeing a ring,
but lack of ornamentation

03:39.777 --> 03:42.111
doesn't necessarily mean
shit these days, so?

03:42.144 --> 03:42.978
Not really sure.

03:44.414 --> 03:45.914
Normally I can tell when I'm
wasting my breath on someone.

03:45.948 --> 03:47.082
But you're heard to read.

03:47.116 --> 03:47.950
Wow.

03:49.252 --> 03:50.420
Does this work for you?

03:50.453 --> 03:51.855
You know what,
you'd be surprised.

03:51.887 --> 03:54.021
Mm, that's an understatement.

03:54.055 --> 03:56.425
Harsh, but accurate.

03:57.793 --> 03:58.861
So how 'bout that drink?

03:58.893 --> 03:59.695
I told you.

03:59.728 --> 04:00.962
You told me, yeah.

04:00.995 --> 04:05.567
He, maybe she,
she's not here yet.

04:07.033 --> 04:10.137
Besides, it's a drink,
not a marriage contract.

04:10.171 --> 04:11.071
Another one, Kevin?

04:11.104 --> 04:12.306
Oh at least.

04:12.340 --> 04:14.876
And if the lady would oblige.

04:14.908 --> 04:16.244
Okay, fine.

04:16.277 --> 04:17.478
What'll you have?

04:17.512 --> 04:19.011
Can I do a diet
and coconut rum?

04:20.213 --> 04:21.914
Took you for a vodka
cranberry kinda girl.

04:21.947 --> 04:22.749
Aw.

04:22.783 --> 04:24.284
There go your instincts.

04:24.317 --> 04:26.186
Leading you down the
wrong path again.

04:26.219 --> 04:28.455
You know they say that
the best rum in the world

04:28.488 --> 04:30.289
comes from Jamaica
but I can tell you

04:30.322 --> 04:34.760
from personal experience
nobody beats the Cubans.

04:34.794 --> 04:38.062
And here I was thinking
that was only cigars.

04:38.096 --> 04:38.898
What?

04:38.930 --> 04:39.732
No.

04:39.765 --> 04:41.167
It's rum too.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.568
And I should know, I
spent all last year there.

04:43.601 --> 04:44.402
For work.

04:44.436 --> 04:45.570
I'm a scientist.

04:45.603 --> 04:47.472
- Hmm.
- Oh yeah.

04:47.505 --> 04:49.072
I study the sky,
I study the stars.

04:49.106 --> 04:50.775
Wow, okay.

04:50.809 --> 04:53.943
Didn't ask, but that sounds fun.

04:54.944 --> 04:55.945
It is fun.

04:57.247 --> 04:59.015
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Carlie.

05:01.117 --> 05:04.288
So yeah, where were we?

05:06.121 --> 05:07.022
Just leaving.

05:07.055 --> 05:07.857
No!

05:07.890 --> 05:08.758
What?

05:08.791 --> 05:09.625
No okay.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.564
Yeah, don't mention it.

05:28.577 --> 05:30.211
So I guess this is goodbye.

05:31.946 --> 05:33.414
Looks that way.

05:33.447 --> 05:35.316
Well I'd be lying if I
said I was gonna miss you.

05:35.349 --> 05:37.585
Ah come on now,
Officer Martin.

05:37.618 --> 05:39.487
We had some good times.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.688
Yeah.

05:40.721 --> 05:42.388
Like that time he almost
ripped your ear off.

05:42.422 --> 05:45.492
Simple misunderstanding
is all it was.

05:45.525 --> 05:46.759
Little love bite.

05:48.495 --> 05:50.230
And then there's
you, Mitchell.

05:50.263 --> 05:51.698
What about me?

05:51.731 --> 05:54.566
I can see why they're sending
Tullis up to the five yard,

05:54.600 --> 05:57.769
but you always struck me
as more of a mild type.

05:57.803 --> 06:00.037
What'd you do to
earn this transfer?

06:00.071 --> 06:01.105
I requested it.

06:03.208 --> 06:05.477
You requested a five yard?

06:05.511 --> 06:06.344
Yeah.

06:07.545 --> 06:09.914
I never took you as
a rocket scientist.

06:09.947 --> 06:13.150
But damn, you can't
be that dense.

06:13.184 --> 06:14.619
Wait, what's wrong
with five yard?

06:16.019 --> 06:17.721
Oh don't worry, you'll
find out soon enough.

06:17.754 --> 06:19.222
Don't listen to 'em, Ronnie,

06:19.256 --> 06:22.024
as long as I got your back you
got nothing to worry about.

06:22.057 --> 06:23.226
That's rich.

06:23.260 --> 06:25.762
Doubt all you
want, but having me

06:25.795 --> 06:28.398
as a friend's a better deal
than most folks realize.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.400
And that's for getting
on my bad side.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.335
Yeah and we know
how that turns out.

06:34.737 --> 06:37.506
This, this could be the end
of the line for you now.

06:38.908 --> 06:41.976
You're gonna spend the rest
of your wasted existence

06:42.010 --> 06:44.746
in the deepest, darkest
hole the DOC has to offer.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.548
Funny thing, that.

06:46.581 --> 06:47.749
- What?
- Life.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.519
It's when you're sure things
are going a certain way

06:51.553 --> 06:54.187
that fate starts
pitching curve balls.

07:03.095 --> 07:04.498
Oh boy, oh boy.

07:16.074 --> 07:17.310
Shit boy, you look like

07:17.343 --> 07:18.843
you're about to have
seizure back there.

07:18.877 --> 07:20.245
What?

07:20.278 --> 07:22.981
No, just nervous.

07:24.049 --> 07:25.350
Hold it quiet, Ronnie.

07:26.718 --> 07:27.552
Huh?

07:30.086 --> 07:31.188
Keep it together.

07:45.668 --> 07:46.502
Wow.

07:50.974 --> 07:51.808
Hey.

07:53.675 --> 07:54.509
Ethan.

07:56.345 --> 07:57.679
What?

07:57.713 --> 07:59.615
We have to get up.

07:59.648 --> 08:01.016
Oh no.

08:01.049 --> 08:01.917
I don't want to.

08:02.951 --> 08:04.118
I know.

08:04.152 --> 08:07.388
But Allie's probably
already waiting for us.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.223
Just five more minutes.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.057
Hmm.

08:10.091 --> 08:12.059
Oh yeah.

08:12.093 --> 08:14.528
I know what
you're trying to do.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.496
You know nothing.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.364
Okay.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.833
I'm going to make
us some breakfast

08:19.866 --> 08:21.735
and you have five minutes.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.738
Is that a kiss?

08:24.771 --> 08:25.639
It was.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.141
That was sweet.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.342
Hmm, I know.

08:32.611 --> 08:33.779
I love you.

08:33.812 --> 08:34.647
I know.

08:35.981 --> 08:36.915
I love you too.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.220
Five minutes!

08:48.893 --> 08:50.662
Oh, smells good.

08:50.695 --> 08:52.296
Hmm, yeah.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.864
There's some fresh coffee too.

08:53.897 --> 08:55.432
Yes, thank you.

08:57.534 --> 08:58.835
Oh.

08:58.869 --> 09:00.470
So did I overhear that right?

09:00.504 --> 09:03.740
Allie's got a friend
coming with her?

09:03.774 --> 09:04.741
Yeah.

09:04.775 --> 09:06.776
A boy she goes to school with.

09:06.809 --> 09:08.145
Boy?

09:08.177 --> 09:09.378
What boy?

09:09.412 --> 09:11.947
Oh it, I can't
remember his name.

09:13.349 --> 09:14.183
Crazy.

09:15.051 --> 09:16.519
Little Allie's got a boyfriend.

09:16.552 --> 09:18.053
She swears it's not like that.

09:18.086 --> 09:20.321
Right.

09:21.956 --> 09:23.224
What?

09:23.258 --> 09:24.959
You think that she
wouldn't tell me?

09:24.993 --> 09:29.997
No, no, I just think that
regardless of what she says

09:31.565 --> 09:33.934
I bet the farm he thinks
he's got a shot with her.

09:33.967 --> 09:36.670
I mean it's possible.

09:36.704 --> 09:38.639
More than possible.

09:38.672 --> 09:39.640
Yeah.

09:39.673 --> 09:40.908
Because you were able

09:40.941 --> 09:42.809
to climb out of the
friend zone with me.

09:42.842 --> 09:46.813
Wait, I didn't know I
was in the friend zone?

09:46.846 --> 09:47.780
Um hmm.

09:47.814 --> 09:48.781
Um hmm.

09:48.815 --> 09:49.682
Yeah.

09:49.716 --> 09:50.550
Really?

09:51.718 --> 09:52.552
Big time.

09:55.954 --> 09:57.055
Huh.

10:30.753 --> 10:32.788
Are you sure we're
even on the right road?

10:32.821 --> 10:35.191
I told my sister I'd have the
car back an hour ago and...

10:35.225 --> 10:36.658
Yes dude, just
keep going straight.

10:36.692 --> 10:38.994
This road isn't even straight.

10:39.027 --> 10:40.929
I'm telling you man,
it's gonna be the weekend.

10:40.963 --> 10:41.829
Why? What's happening?

10:41.863 --> 10:42.864
Allie.

10:42.897 --> 10:43.998
Finally getting in there.

10:44.031 --> 10:46.400
Oh bullshit!

10:46.434 --> 10:48.237
She's practically
been begging for it.

10:48.269 --> 10:49.537
Why else do you think

10:49.570 --> 10:51.038
she invited me on this
camping trip with her?

10:51.072 --> 10:52.141
You're dreaming.

10:52.174 --> 10:53.341
Hmm.

10:53.373 --> 10:54.808
Yeah, we'll see.

10:54.841 --> 10:55.776
Sure will.

10:55.809 --> 10:56.643
What, you don't believe me?

10:56.676 --> 10:57.944
Let's bet on it.

10:57.978 --> 10:58.912
You already owe
me like 30 bucks.

10:58.945 --> 11:00.781
Oh, well double or nothing

11:00.814 --> 11:02.449
says I close the deal by Sunday.

11:02.482 --> 11:04.252
Keep your money.

11:04.284 --> 11:05.253
Well pay me back
what you owe me.

11:05.285 --> 11:06.318
But keep the rest.

11:06.352 --> 11:07.187
Turn here.

11:12.291 --> 11:13.425
That's the place?

11:13.459 --> 11:14.660
This is Allie's house?

11:14.693 --> 11:15.895
Pretty nice, right?

11:15.928 --> 11:17.695
Oh shit.

11:17.729 --> 11:19.364
Anyway I would invite you up

11:19.397 --> 11:21.933
but I think Allie wants to
spend some alone time with me

11:21.966 --> 11:23.468
before her sister picks us up.

11:25.237 --> 11:26.371
All right bro.

11:26.404 --> 11:27.605
Wish me luck.

11:27.639 --> 11:28.706
Good luck.

12:19.586 --> 12:20.386
Allie?

12:21.521 --> 12:22.355
Dylan.

12:24.591 --> 12:25.658
Hello?

12:26.526 --> 12:27.328
Whoa.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.262
Hey.

12:28.295 --> 12:29.928
Oh my gosh, Stew get off him.

12:31.297 --> 12:32.097
Hey.

12:32.131 --> 12:32.931
You okay?

12:32.965 --> 12:34.167
Yeah.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.034
Don't worry,
he's all bark and no bite.

12:36.068 --> 12:37.303
I'll be down in a minute.

12:53.917 --> 12:54.784
Hey.

12:55.752 --> 12:56.920
Hey.

12:56.953 --> 12:58.021
I was just...

12:58.054 --> 12:59.223
Hungry?

12:59.257 --> 13:00.023
Looking for
something to drink.

13:00.056 --> 13:01.391
Oh help yourself.

13:11.301 --> 13:13.203
Can I help you find something?

13:13.236 --> 13:15.504
My charger, can't
remember where I left it.

13:24.313 --> 13:25.281
Here it is.

13:26.148 --> 13:27.682
What?

13:27.715 --> 13:28.549
Nothing.

13:38.792 --> 13:39.626
Kevin.

13:40.627 --> 13:41.460
Hey.

13:42.995 --> 13:44.331
For
Christ sakes, what?

13:44.364 --> 13:46.400
You're sleeping on my floor.

13:46.432 --> 13:48.100
Dammit Kevin, get up.

13:49.035 --> 13:50.102
In a minute, okay?

13:50.137 --> 13:51.103
No.

13:51.138 --> 13:51.938
Not okay.

13:51.971 --> 13:52.805
Come on.

13:58.244 --> 13:59.511
Fuck, Amy, really?

13:59.544 --> 14:00.645
Really.

14:00.679 --> 14:01.513
Get up.

14:04.183 --> 14:06.517
Then again for those
viewers just tuning in,

14:06.550 --> 14:09.620
a massive man hunt is under
way for these two men,

14:09.653 --> 14:11.622
Jacob Tullis and
Ronald Mitchell.

14:11.655 --> 14:13.624
Details are still unclear.

14:13.657 --> 14:16.294
But both men somehow
managed to escape last night

14:16.328 --> 14:18.528
from the Southerland
Correctional Facility.

14:18.561 --> 14:21.265
We will keep you posted on
this very important story...

14:21.298 --> 14:22.765
- That's crazy.
- As it develops.

14:22.799 --> 14:24.634
Be safer and smarter

14:24.667 --> 14:26.437
with Big Buck's
personal guarantee.

14:29.005 --> 14:30.472
Is there any coffee?

14:30.505 --> 14:32.841
It's half past three
in the afternoon.

14:32.874 --> 14:34.076
All right, how about
some of that wine, then?

14:34.110 --> 14:36.545
I think you had more
than enough last night.

14:36.578 --> 14:37.579
Yeah, but that was last night.

14:37.612 --> 14:38.814
As for today.

14:42.817 --> 14:44.152
I didn't see
you car out there.

14:44.186 --> 14:45.019
Took an Uber.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.189
You know me, safety first.

14:50.725 --> 14:52.260
We need to talk, Kevin.

14:53.427 --> 14:54.894
This isn't gonna be good.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.030
You can't use my place
as your crash pad anymore.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.466
I know.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.101
I have no interest in telling
you how to live your life,

15:00.134 --> 15:04.271
I just, scenes like that
are why we broke up.

15:04.305 --> 15:05.472
Got it.

15:05.504 --> 15:06.638
I'm serious.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.141
Just because I haven't
changed the lock

15:08.174 --> 15:10.310
doesn't mean you can barge in
in the middle of the night,

15:10.343 --> 15:12.678
pass out on my
family room floor.

15:12.711 --> 15:13.512
I hear ya.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.947
Ya say that.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.349
But I don't think ya do.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.782
Oh no, I get it.

15:18.916 --> 15:20.452
You dump me and now you need me

15:20.486 --> 15:22.454
to let you get on
with your life.

15:24.390 --> 15:25.290
- Kevin.
- Ah!

15:25.324 --> 15:26.758
This hangover's killing me.

15:29.693 --> 15:31.329
Where's your stemware?

15:31.362 --> 15:32.263
Oh fuck it.

15:34.365 --> 15:35.665
What?

15:35.699 --> 15:37.268
You look like shit.

15:37.301 --> 15:40.238
Yeah well take into account
how drunk I got last night,

15:40.271 --> 15:41.737
I think the fact that
I'm standing upright

15:41.771 --> 15:43.005
is accomplishment enough.

15:46.243 --> 15:47.076
God.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.480
I don't know how I'm gonna
get through my shift tonight.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.382
Look, go take a shower,

15:54.549 --> 15:57.018
I'll put a pot of coffee
on for you, all right?

16:15.170 --> 16:16.137
Hey Ethan.

16:16.171 --> 16:17.670
'Sup man?

16:17.703 --> 16:19.072
How much further?

16:20.174 --> 16:21.375
20 minutes tops.

16:22.509 --> 16:24.511
I'm not sure I
can wait that long.

16:24.545 --> 16:26.447
I really have to pee.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.881
That's what you get for
downing all that soda.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.186
Can you pull over real quick?

16:34.953 --> 16:35.987
Yeah, sure.

16:42.194 --> 16:43.861
Oh this damn door.

16:43.894 --> 16:44.728
Whew.

16:46.164 --> 16:47.265
Where the hell is he going?

16:47.299 --> 16:48.899
I think he's
probably just gun shy.

16:48.933 --> 16:50.435
You know how it is.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.370
Such a dork.

16:52.404 --> 16:53.571
A cute dork, though.

16:54.971 --> 16:57.308
I'm surprised Mom
let him come with us.

16:57.341 --> 16:58.576
It's not like that.

16:59.543 --> 17:00.311
Really.

17:00.344 --> 17:01.245
We're just friends.

17:01.278 --> 17:02.446
Oh yeah, does he know that?

17:03.746 --> 17:06.282
Allie, you have to
be straightforward

17:06.316 --> 17:07.649
when it comes to
things like this

17:07.683 --> 17:09.751
or he might get the
wrong impression.

17:18.093 --> 17:18.926
Much better.

17:40.946 --> 17:43.350
Jake, why did we stop?

17:45.152 --> 17:47.187
'Cause you're
gushing like a sieve.

17:47.220 --> 17:48.555
If we don't change
them dressings

17:48.588 --> 17:50.223
you'll be gone by morning.

17:50.257 --> 17:52.991
I don't like it man, being
out in the open like this.

17:53.024 --> 17:54.826
Guess you'd rather
bleed out then.

17:57.496 --> 17:58.497
Keep your head down.

17:59.398 --> 18:00.399
I'll be right back.

18:10.108 --> 18:11.008
Afternoon.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.243
You got any first aid kits?

18:12.277 --> 18:14.044
Aisle three next to
the tools and auto.

18:14.077 --> 18:14.912
Thanks.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.797
$31.50.

18:42.571 --> 18:43.438
Just enough.

18:52.647 --> 18:54.248
Hello, excuse you.

18:54.281 --> 18:55.782
Hey Roy.

18:55.815 --> 18:56.617
Ed.

18:57.551 --> 18:58.419
Fill up on three.

19:01.288 --> 19:02.189
You got it.

19:02.223 --> 19:03.390
What's that you got on the TV?

19:03.424 --> 19:04.625
About last night.

19:04.658 --> 19:05.491
Jail break.

19:06.392 --> 19:07.527
They still ain't got 'em?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.095
Apparently not.

19:09.128 --> 19:10.330
Huh.

19:10.363 --> 19:11.164
What's the reward?

19:11.197 --> 19:12.064
Didn't say.

19:13.765 --> 19:15.734
That'd be a hunt
worth joining for sure.

19:41.790 --> 19:43.293
Hey Roy, Ed.

19:43.326 --> 19:44.994
- Hey Matt.
- Matt.

19:45.027 --> 19:47.631
Just came down the wire,
they're having me pass these out.

19:47.664 --> 19:50.567
10k, that's all these
boys is worth to 'em?

19:50.600 --> 19:52.135
Hardly worth taking
a bullet over.

19:52.168 --> 19:53.502
I'm sure they're
on a beach somewhere

19:53.535 --> 19:55.704
sipping margaritas as we speak.

19:55.738 --> 19:57.172
You do me a favor, hang
that in your window?

19:57.206 --> 19:58.407
Yeah, sure thing.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.377
Hey Matt, it's good to
have you back in town.

20:02.478 --> 20:04.346
I's sorry to hear
about your little girl.

20:08.949 --> 20:10.151
Yeah, condolences man.

20:22.129 --> 20:23.563
Armed and dangerous.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.964
Shit.

20:24.997 --> 20:26.433
For 20k maybe.

20:28.702 --> 20:30.436
What the hell took
you so damn long?

20:30.469 --> 20:31.737
You see that cop?

20:31.771 --> 20:32.804
Yeah, I saw him.

20:33.706 --> 20:35.107
Question is did he see you?

20:36.208 --> 20:37.109
I don't think so.

20:38.877 --> 20:40.911
Let's get the hell outta here.

20:40.944 --> 20:42.314
Not gonna argue with that.

20:47.752 --> 20:48.620
Yo Jake.

20:49.788 --> 20:50.988
The highway's back that way.

20:51.021 --> 20:52.090
Fuck the highway.

20:53.157 --> 20:54.491
What?

20:54.525 --> 20:55.326
There'll be checkpoints
every 50 miles

20:55.359 --> 20:56.593
from here to the border.

20:56.627 --> 20:57.428
What then?

20:57.461 --> 20:58.928
Cut through the park.

20:58.961 --> 21:00.464
Might be the slow
road, but it spills out

21:00.497 --> 21:02.599
a stone's throw from old Mexico.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.134
I don't know man.

21:04.168 --> 21:05.401
You gotta learn to trust
me a little more, Ronnie.

21:05.435 --> 21:06.835
I got us this far, didn't I?

21:06.868 --> 21:09.037
In case you didn't notice
I'm bleeding to death.

21:09.072 --> 21:10.673
Man, there's no pleasing some.

21:41.835 --> 21:43.069
Buck's Brakes.

21:43.103 --> 21:44.571
Hi, may I speak with Buck?

21:44.604 --> 21:45.904
Big Buck or Lil Buck?

21:45.938 --> 21:46.840
Lil Buck.

21:57.549 --> 21:58.350
Gina!

22:01.919 --> 22:02.755
This is Buck.

22:02.788 --> 22:03.655
Hey, it's me.

22:04.822 --> 22:06.290
Gina?

22:06.324 --> 22:07.792
Look, I was hoping

22:07.825 --> 22:09.794
maybe you could fit me in
sometime this afternoon?

22:17.032 --> 22:17.868
What time?

22:19.169 --> 22:20.837
About an hour.

22:20.871 --> 22:22.105
Okay, sounds like a plan.

22:22.139 --> 22:23.206
I'll see ya then.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.074
Bye.

22:50.331 --> 22:53.767
Now Big Buck knows how
to satisfy the ladies.

22:53.801 --> 22:55.869
Bring your cars down
and get your brakes done

22:55.903 --> 22:57.404
and we'll fix yours too.

22:57.438 --> 22:58.772
So if you're looking
for quality parts,

22:58.806 --> 23:00.039
go to Buck's Brakes.

23:00.073 --> 23:03.110
Buck's Brakes, puttin'
holes in the competition

23:03.143 --> 23:04.677
since the 1970s.

23:04.710 --> 23:06.379
And don't forget our promise.

23:06.412 --> 23:09.449
Fast service,
satisfaction guaranteed.

23:10.716 --> 23:11.684
- What?
- Come on down to Buck's.

23:11.717 --> 23:13.219
Where you're always satisfied.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.355
Is the man of
the house around?

23:17.389 --> 23:19.257
Nah, I killed him years ago.

23:19.291 --> 23:20.792
How you doing, Wayne?

23:20.826 --> 23:21.893
Fine, partner.

23:21.927 --> 23:23.228
Hey, what do we have here?

23:25.096 --> 23:27.899
Armed and extremely dangerous?

23:27.933 --> 23:29.600
10,000.

23:29.633 --> 23:30.801
Not bad.

23:30.835 --> 23:32.803
Long as you don't
mind eating lead for it.

23:32.837 --> 23:33.838
Hey Gina.

23:33.871 --> 23:34.672
Hey Wayne.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.106
Where you going?

23:36.140 --> 23:37.441
Yoga class.

23:37.475 --> 23:38.375
Won't be home 'til late.

23:38.409 --> 23:40.043
So don't wait up.

23:40.077 --> 23:41.211
Never do.

23:41.244 --> 23:44.046
That's an extremely
long yoga class.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.582
Yeah, the Cards just
ain't been the same

23:45.615 --> 23:46.916
since they traded Colton.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.252
This team is a god
damn shit show now.

24:00.729 --> 24:02.297
I don't know man.

24:02.331 --> 24:04.066
She said it still leaks.

24:04.099 --> 24:04.998
That's bullshit.

24:05.031 --> 24:06.267
I sealed those cams myself.

24:07.201 --> 24:08.001
That's great.

24:08.034 --> 24:08.970
I'll replace 'em on 'em.

24:09.002 --> 24:10.371
Yep.

24:10.404 --> 24:11.506
Hey Gina.

24:11.539 --> 24:12.940
Hey Nick.

24:12.974 --> 24:14.375
Lil Buck's in the back.

24:14.408 --> 24:17.344
But you know, maybe I
could do something for you.

24:17.377 --> 24:18.512
Not a chance.

24:20.012 --> 24:20.914
Had to try.

24:45.069 --> 24:45.904
Hey there.

24:48.273 --> 24:52.210
So, gonna take me for
a ride in this thing?

24:52.243 --> 24:53.744
What, this thing?

24:53.777 --> 24:55.879
This thing's barely
got an engine.

24:55.913 --> 24:57.814
Well, what else ya got?

24:59.116 --> 25:01.518
I'm sure we could
figure something out.

25:01.552 --> 25:03.320
Just let me get cleaned up
and we'll get outta here.

25:03.353 --> 25:04.388
Sounds like a plan.

25:21.202 --> 25:22.370
Money, shit.

25:33.647 --> 25:35.282
Lost your
card again, Kevin?

25:35.316 --> 25:36.150
Yes, Julie.

25:53.532 --> 25:54.333
You're late.

25:55.267 --> 25:56.201
I know, Julie.

25:56.234 --> 25:57.235
- Again.
- I know.

25:57.269 --> 25:58.503
It's the third time this week.

25:58.537 --> 25:59.771
It's getting old.

25:59.805 --> 26:01.306
Hey Julie, I can
take it from here.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.275
You look like hell.

26:04.209 --> 26:05.409
Yeah, thanks for that.

26:05.443 --> 26:06.644
Why don't you finish
charting sector two,

26:06.677 --> 26:07.912
'cause it shoulda
been done days ago.

26:07.945 --> 26:09.280
Yeah, I'm on top of it.

26:09.313 --> 26:10.147
I'm serious.

26:10.181 --> 26:11.816
Christ, I know, okay?

26:12.717 --> 26:13.618
Goodbye, Kevin.

26:14.619 --> 26:15.453
Good.

26:25.128 --> 26:26.196
Hey Kevin!

26:28.530 --> 26:29.431
'Sup, Hector?

26:29.465 --> 26:30.366
Just gonna start in the lobby

26:30.399 --> 26:31.367
and work my way up through here.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.601
Fascinating.

26:32.635 --> 26:34.470
So I'll see ya around then?

26:34.503 --> 26:35.337
Uh huh.

26:36.405 --> 26:37.206
Oh hey, Hector?

26:37.239 --> 26:38.474
Yep.

26:38.507 --> 26:40.110
I'm nursing the
hangover from hell

26:40.142 --> 26:42.176
and the noise from that
thing cuts right through me.

26:42.210 --> 26:44.079
Can we just, I don't know,

26:44.113 --> 26:45.847
take it easy on the
floor buffing tonight?

26:45.880 --> 26:46.781
Sure thing.

26:46.814 --> 26:47.882
I'll be as quick as I can.

26:47.915 --> 26:49.051
Appreciate it.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.988
So what, man?

26:55.022 --> 26:56.890
Lil Buck just gets to
cut out again early?

26:56.923 --> 26:59.093
Yeah, I guess so.

26:59.127 --> 27:00.394
I don't get that shit.

27:00.427 --> 27:01.228
What's that?

27:01.261 --> 27:02.462
Fucking Gina, man.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.563
I mean what the fuck's
she see in that guy?

27:04.597 --> 27:06.265
What's Lil Buck got
that I don't got, huh?

27:06.298 --> 27:07.366
Grandpa does own the place.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.501
Big fucking deal.

27:10.836 --> 27:12.038
You know what the
real question is?

27:12.072 --> 27:13.973
Is what does Lil Buck
got that Roy ain't got?

27:14.006 --> 27:15.708
A functioning wang.

27:15.741 --> 27:18.376
I mean as small as
that shit's gotta be.

27:18.410 --> 27:19.911
At least it stands tall, huh?

27:19.944 --> 27:21.980
You seem to know an awful
lot about Lil Buck's member.

27:22.013 --> 27:25.383
Is that the answer to the
question how you got this job?

27:25.417 --> 27:26.851
Fuck you, man.

27:26.885 --> 27:28.054
Oh hey Doc.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.722
You know I plumb forgot I
had an appointment today.

27:32.956 --> 27:34.591
All right, well
I'll be right over.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.927
Thanks for calling to remind me.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.295
See you in a short while.

27:42.865 --> 27:45.301
You boys seen Lil Buck around?

27:45.334 --> 27:46.502
Yes sir.

27:46.536 --> 27:48.204
He actually just took
off with Ms. Gina.

27:48.237 --> 27:49.472
Gina Waxman?

27:49.505 --> 27:51.240
Roy's wife?

27:51.274 --> 27:52.741
What the hell for?

27:52.774 --> 27:54.342
I don't know man, she
said she needed a tune up.

27:54.376 --> 27:56.344
You know her car can't
be in that great a shape,

27:56.378 --> 27:57.879
her being in here so often.

27:57.913 --> 27:59.848
Well anyway I'm about to
go over to the Doc Stew's

27:59.881 --> 28:02.451
and get prodded and
probed and poked.

28:02.484 --> 28:04.318
Pat, I'm gonna leave you
in charge 'til I get back.

28:04.351 --> 28:05.486
Patrick, man.

28:05.519 --> 28:06.687
Why'd you pick him?

28:06.721 --> 28:08.190
'Cause you talk
too damn, much, Nick.

28:08.255 --> 28:09.223
Now go back to work.

28:13.128 --> 28:15.262
Need a hand with anything?

28:15.296 --> 28:16.463
Nah, I got it.

28:16.496 --> 28:18.364
It'd be cool if I
had one of those beers.

28:18.398 --> 28:19.432
Yeah, go for it.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.469
Not gonna rat me out to
the girls' parents are ya?

28:22.502 --> 28:23.336
Hell no.

28:24.771 --> 28:25.605
All right, we're good.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.510
So how long you and
Rose been together?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.613
Man,
since junior high.

28:35.514 --> 28:36.482
That's a long time.

28:36.515 --> 28:37.750
Yeah.

28:37.783 --> 28:39.518
Allie might as well be
like my little sister.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.384
Right on.

28:44.589 --> 28:45.890
Just so we
understand each other,

28:45.923 --> 28:47.159
you seem like a good guy.

28:48.292 --> 28:50.828
But I look out for Allie
like she's my blood.

28:50.862 --> 28:52.429
I get it.

28:52.462 --> 28:53.663
I'm cool with that, man.

28:54.865 --> 28:56.600
Okay.

29:18.154 --> 29:19.255
How much further?

29:19.287 --> 29:20.256
Aw, winded already?

29:20.288 --> 29:21.523
Girl's outta shape.

29:21.556 --> 29:24.126
No, girl just
hates climbing rocks.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.326
- Oh.
- Oh, made it.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.195
Yeah.

29:27.163 --> 29:29.030
Oh, thanks.

29:29.063 --> 29:30.098
I love this spot.

29:32.033 --> 29:33.201
Yeah it's pretty.

29:33.234 --> 29:35.103
Oh, that's an understatement.

29:35.136 --> 29:37.138
Look, not to like
kill the moment,

29:37.172 --> 29:38.639
but I'm getting kinda hungry.

29:38.672 --> 29:39.907
Can we head back to camp soon?

29:39.940 --> 29:40.740
Just a sec.

29:40.773 --> 29:41.607
Take it in.

29:43.210 --> 29:44.510
Fascinating.

29:44.544 --> 29:45.378
Wow.

29:51.751 --> 29:53.819
Are you sure
we're even on the right road?

29:53.852 --> 29:56.621
I told my sister I'd have
the car back an hour ago.

29:56.655 --> 29:58.057
Oh.

29:58.090 --> 30:00.492
Yeah, but I'm still
nervous about telling them.

30:00.525 --> 30:01.326
Why?

30:01.359 --> 30:02.161
They love Ethan.

30:02.195 --> 30:03.895
I know, it's just,

30:03.929 --> 30:06.997
I don't wanna hear it from
Mom about being too young

30:07.032 --> 30:10.634
or Dad and his finish
college first speech.

30:10.668 --> 30:12.237
I'm so happy for you.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.071
And I love you too.

30:13.104 --> 30:14.371
Aw, thank you.

30:14.405 --> 30:15.606
Ethan's a great guy.

30:15.639 --> 30:16.840
He is.

30:16.873 --> 30:19.776
Yeah, he's, he's
one in a million.

30:19.809 --> 30:20.643
Yeah.

30:23.147 --> 30:24.681
What the fuck is that shit?

30:24.714 --> 30:25.915
I talk too much.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.151
You do.

30:27.184 --> 30:28.550
Look how you just
ratted out Lil Buck.

30:28.584 --> 30:30.485
It's not about ratting
anybody out, man.

30:30.519 --> 30:31.887
The guy should not
be dipping his stick

30:31.920 --> 30:33.156
in another man's oil.

30:36.425 --> 30:39.494
All right, got any you
wanna throw in on this, babe?

30:39.528 --> 30:42.231
I just hate spending money
on this dirt weed shit.

30:42.264 --> 30:44.032
There's not any other
dispensaries around here

30:44.066 --> 30:45.967
so it's this or nothing.

30:46.000 --> 30:46.801
Yeah.

30:48.237 --> 30:49.403
Here.

30:49.437 --> 30:50.239
Cool.

30:50.272 --> 30:51.073
I'll text him.

30:53.673 --> 30:54.641
Whoop.

30:54.674 --> 30:56.476
Bad news for you my man.

30:56.509 --> 30:57.611
Duty calls.

31:00.281 --> 31:01.514
Hey.

31:01.548 --> 31:02.549
Here's hoping my
favorite customers

31:02.582 --> 31:04.118
are having a pleasant afternoon.

31:04.150 --> 31:04.984
How are you doing?

31:05.017 --> 31:06.485
I'm doing fine.

31:06.518 --> 31:08.520
You guys are about to be
doing really fine as well

31:08.554 --> 31:10.789
once you burn a little bit
of that kind right there.

31:10.823 --> 31:11.657
Thanks.

31:12.958 --> 31:13.792
Good day, eh?

31:21.267 --> 31:22.667
Will you be my maid of honor?

31:22.700 --> 31:24.469
- Of course!
- Yay.

31:24.502 --> 31:25.337
Yay!

31:27.306 --> 31:28.172
I know, I know.

31:31.541 --> 31:32.976
What the hell was that?

31:34.279 --> 31:35.445
Oh my god.

31:35.479 --> 31:37.148
Is that like a
meteor or something.

31:38.415 --> 31:39.250
I don't know.

31:46.889 --> 31:48.292
What is that?

31:48.325 --> 31:49.126
Hey Kevin!

31:50.559 --> 31:51.994
- Kevin.
- What man?

31:52.029 --> 31:53.029
You gotta take a
look at this, man.

31:53.062 --> 31:53.862
Come on.

31:57.766 --> 31:58.733
Wow.

31:58.767 --> 31:59.634
That's what I thought.

32:01.469 --> 32:02.904
We gotta get this recorded.

32:06.408 --> 32:09.877
Meteor impact
approximately 1900 hours.

32:09.910 --> 32:14.915
Coordinates 43.7 I739 and.

32:16.649 --> 32:17.450
What the hell?

32:17.483 --> 32:18.385
What does that mean?

32:18.419 --> 32:19.186
I'm picking up a signal.

32:20.753 --> 32:22.488
Patching into it.

32:22.522 --> 32:24.058
That noise?

32:24.091 --> 32:25.992
Holy shit.

32:26.026 --> 32:26.826
- What is it?
- Shh!

32:26.859 --> 32:27.694
Please, Hector.

32:36.135 --> 32:36.902
Hey, what's up?

32:36.935 --> 32:38.438
Hey Smiley, it's me.

32:38.470 --> 32:39.871
Who this?

32:39.905 --> 32:41.106
What do you mean, who's
this man, it's Nick.

32:41.139 --> 32:42.407
I'm at the spot
man, where you at?

32:42.441 --> 32:43.774
Running late homie.

32:43.808 --> 32:44.608
Come on man.

32:44.642 --> 32:45.676
I'm on my lunch break.

32:45.710 --> 32:46.944
I can't be out here all day.

32:46.978 --> 32:48.447
Chill out
man, I'll be there.

32:48.479 --> 32:49.414
How long?

32:49.448 --> 32:50.382
Soon, just chill.

32:50.415 --> 32:51.716
Man, hurry up, all right.

32:51.749 --> 32:53.250
I'm supposed to back
at work already.

32:53.284 --> 32:55.086
Hey, you gonna
chill if you want this real.

32:55.119 --> 32:56.619
I'll get there when I get there.

32:56.653 --> 32:57.587
A'ight?

32:57.620 --> 32:59.123
Hey look man, I'm chill okay?

32:59.156 --> 33:00.757
I just don't wanna lose
my job over this shit.

33:00.790 --> 33:01.691
I'll get to you, man.

33:01.725 --> 33:03.160
Hang tight.

33:03.194 --> 33:05.061
Oh man.

33:14.270 --> 33:17.605
What happened
to the tunes, man?

33:17.638 --> 33:18.606
Out of batteries?

33:19.540 --> 33:20.808
I just charged those.

33:36.823 --> 33:38.292
Fuck me.

33:38.326 --> 33:39.093
What's wrong?

33:39.127 --> 33:39.960
Car's dead.

33:47.967 --> 33:48.801
Dammit!

33:49.969 --> 33:51.171
Peace of shit.

34:00.678 --> 34:03.516
Aw come on man, no,
no, no, no, no, not now.

34:03.548 --> 34:04.382
Come on.

34:05.883 --> 34:07.085
Fucking shit, man.

34:08.453 --> 34:10.055
Say hello to my little friend.

34:11.722 --> 34:13.058
Magpul Foregrip.

34:14.025 --> 34:16.126
Sertac iron sights.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.428
FDE Heatguard.

34:17.461 --> 34:18.462
Fascinating.

34:22.299 --> 34:23.467
God dammit, Buck.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.768
Are you trying to
blow my ear drums out?

34:25.802 --> 34:26.569
Wanna try it?

34:26.602 --> 34:27.404
Pass.

34:27.438 --> 34:28.603
Come on.

34:28.637 --> 34:29.671
You don't know what
you're missing.

34:29.704 --> 34:30.506
Come on.

34:33.409 --> 34:34.943
Turn this way.

34:34.976 --> 34:35.977
Left foot out front.

34:37.679 --> 34:39.915
Just let the stock rest
right here on your shoulder.

34:41.283 --> 34:42.983
Then aim for that bullseye.

34:43.018 --> 34:44.352
Just line up the sights.

34:45.554 --> 34:46.388
Just like that.

34:49.257 --> 34:50.092
I hit it!

34:50.125 --> 34:50.958
Sure did.

34:53.327 --> 34:54.761
What?

34:54.794 --> 34:57.098
You have any idea how
sexy you look holding that?

35:21.686 --> 35:22.887
Wait.

35:27.825 --> 35:28.658
Okay.

35:32.597 --> 35:34.398
You are so hot.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.302
Yeah?

35:39.902 --> 35:41.171
Hell yes.

35:46.842 --> 35:48.478
Are you ready for your close up?

35:49.513 --> 35:50.547
You're such a dumb ass.

36:00.623 --> 36:01.457
What the fuck?

36:02.591 --> 36:04.259
What, did you
forget to charge it?

36:04.292 --> 36:05.126
I guess so.

36:07.295 --> 36:08.129
Who cares.

36:10.565 --> 36:12.167
This is crazy!

36:12.200 --> 36:13.234
You musta blown the breaker.

36:13.268 --> 36:14.602
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

36:14.636 --> 36:15.570
All right, hurry!

36:20.507 --> 36:21.441
Come on, come on.

36:22.609 --> 36:23.776
Come on, come on.

36:26.079 --> 36:27.114
Shit.

36:29.649 --> 36:32.485
112 617 to dispatch,
do you copy?

36:34.686 --> 36:38.224
112, this is 617 to
dispatch, do you copy?

36:41.725 --> 36:42.561
Great.

36:59.543 --> 37:01.679
Hector, what's taking so long?

37:01.744 --> 37:02.879
It's not the breakers.

37:02.912 --> 37:04.380
And the backup generator
is also offline too.

37:04.414 --> 37:05.648
Okay, what does that mean?

37:05.682 --> 37:07.317
I don't know, but the
odds of them both going,

37:07.350 --> 37:08.218
and then there's this.

37:08.251 --> 37:09.085
Grab your phone.

37:09.952 --> 37:11.354
They're not working.

37:11.387 --> 37:13.956
Anything electrical
around here isn't working.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.391
Interesting.

37:15.425 --> 37:17.025
Right before we lost
power I recorded some kind

37:17.059 --> 37:18.627
of energy surge in there.

37:18.660 --> 37:21.230
It's possible the surge
caused a massive short.

37:21.263 --> 37:22.698
What does that mean?

37:22.730 --> 37:25.866
It means that some kind
of electronic emission

37:25.900 --> 37:28.269
has actually managed to
cause a full blackout.

37:28.302 --> 37:29.103
And what are we gonna do?

37:29.136 --> 37:30.037
You do as you like.

37:30.071 --> 37:31.005
I'm heading to that impact site.

37:37.011 --> 37:38.179
Did you cum?

37:40.547 --> 37:41.981
You gonna take me home?

37:44.184 --> 37:45.018
Oh so soon?

37:47.120 --> 37:48.421
You know how this works.

37:50.223 --> 37:51.923
What, being the
guy on the side?

37:52.957 --> 37:54.193
Yeah, it's fucking great.

37:55.594 --> 37:56.428
Really?

38:01.966 --> 38:02.800
What?

38:04.801 --> 38:06.070
I don't know.

38:06.104 --> 38:07.171
Car won't start.

38:10.608 --> 38:11.842
Can I see your phone?

38:11.875 --> 38:13.645
- Yeah.
- Mine's dead.

38:17.514 --> 38:18.948
And so's yours.

38:19.882 --> 38:21.385
No, it's fully charged.

38:36.532 --> 38:38.567
Oh perfect, I was
coming back for a flare.

38:38.601 --> 38:39.701
This is even better.

38:40.901 --> 38:41.603
Why don't you just
come with me, man?

38:41.636 --> 38:42.870
No.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.372
Whatever caused this
could be dangerous.

38:44.406 --> 38:45.473
It could also be a find

38:45.507 --> 38:48.176
of some real scientific
significance.

38:48.209 --> 38:49.877
And I'm not passing up the
opportunity to be the guy

38:49.910 --> 38:51.179
that first discovered it.

38:53.080 --> 38:53.981
So what do ya say?

38:56.583 --> 38:57.484
That's the spirit.

38:59.819 --> 39:00.621
Really?

39:02.389 --> 39:03.457
My tablet's dead.

39:04.657 --> 39:06.092
Just like my phone.

39:06.125 --> 39:07.093
Yeah, mine too.

39:08.027 --> 39:09.462
God damn.

39:09.495 --> 39:11.197
Rose, Allie, I was just
gonna go looking for you guys.

39:11.230 --> 39:12.732
Strangest thing happened.

39:12.765 --> 39:15.201
We saw something crash and
like a beam or something.

39:15.234 --> 39:16.601
And suddenly our phones died.

39:16.635 --> 39:18.136
Ours too.

39:18.170 --> 39:19.371
Yeah, I was just trying
to charge mine at the car

39:19.404 --> 39:20.372
but I can't even get
the car to start.

39:20.405 --> 39:22.007
This is getting scary.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.241
Wait a minute.

39:23.275 --> 39:25.110
You guys said you
saw something crash?

39:25.143 --> 39:27.179
- Like a meteor.
- Followed by beam.

39:27.212 --> 39:28.112
Crazy.

39:28.145 --> 39:29.347
What do you guys think it?

39:30.448 --> 39:31.948
Shh, hear that?

39:31.982 --> 39:32.817
Hey there.

39:33.984 --> 39:35.186
- Hey.
- Our car died

39:35.219 --> 39:37.822
all of the sudden
and I saw your fire.

39:37.854 --> 39:40.457
I was hoping you folks
could lend us a jump.

39:40.490 --> 39:42.958
Yeah, I don't think a
jump is gonna help you man.

39:42.992 --> 39:44.194
Why's that?

39:44.227 --> 39:45.128
For some reason ours
won't start either.

39:45.161 --> 39:46.696
- Shit.
- I'd offer you

39:46.730 --> 39:48.897
my phone, but it's dead too.

39:48.931 --> 39:50.100
It's kind of an emergency.

39:50.133 --> 39:51.501
See my buddy and me
we're out hunting

39:51.534 --> 39:53.935
and he accidentally
shot himself.

39:53.968 --> 39:55.170
If I don't get
him some help soon

39:55.204 --> 39:57.206
he's not gonna last
through the night.

39:57.239 --> 39:58.040
Where is he?

39:58.073 --> 39:58.973
Back at the car.

40:00.209 --> 40:01.377
Boy's lost a lotta blood.

40:01.410 --> 40:03.045
Maybe you fellas could
help me move him,

40:03.078 --> 40:04.679
spare some water.

40:04.712 --> 40:05.613
I don't know man.

40:05.646 --> 40:07.248
I'd be much obliged to ya.

40:07.281 --> 40:08.716
Look, I'm sorry to trouble you,

40:08.750 --> 40:11.986
but if we don't at
least keep him hydrated

40:12.019 --> 40:13.755
he won't make it
through the night.

40:16.690 --> 40:17.624
I guess I'll go.

40:18.859 --> 40:20.427
Look, we've gotta help the guy.

40:22.195 --> 40:23.029
It'll be okay.

40:25.399 --> 40:26.233
All right.

40:36.876 --> 40:37.843
What's the matter?

40:40.044 --> 40:41.613
It's incredible.

40:41.646 --> 40:43.148
I don't like this.

40:43.181 --> 40:43.982
Oh wow!

40:45.517 --> 40:46.584
Is that a?

40:46.618 --> 40:47.419
Yeah.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.888
It looks like he's
hurt from the crash.

40:49.920 --> 40:51.356
Maybe we should
go get some help.

40:51.389 --> 40:53.624
And leave my discovery behind
for anyone else to claim?

40:53.657 --> 40:54.458
Not happening.

41:05.902 --> 41:07.136
Fuck!

41:07.170 --> 41:08.805
Hey Kevin, you okay?

41:11.974 --> 41:13.109
Good job, Kevin.

41:16.011 --> 41:18.814
It's an energy field
protecting the alien

41:18.847 --> 41:21.116
in case it falls
unconscious or something,

41:21.149 --> 41:22.517
like a defense mechanism.

41:23.819 --> 41:25.487
Hey, something's
happening man.

41:38.566 --> 41:39.433
No, no, no!

42:17.767 --> 42:18.568
Is this you?

42:18.602 --> 42:19.703
This is me.

42:19.736 --> 42:20.537
Okay.

42:22.472 --> 42:24.374
Hey Ronnie man,
I got you some wa.

42:26.576 --> 42:27.410
Ronnie?

42:33.816 --> 42:35.217
Damn.

42:35.251 --> 42:36.619
Is he okay?

42:36.652 --> 42:37.753
Shit brother.

42:39.288 --> 42:40.488
What's up?

42:40.522 --> 42:42.490
What's the matter, is he okay?

42:42.524 --> 42:43.358
He's dead.

42:50.365 --> 42:52.399
Are you sure?

42:52.432 --> 42:53.233
Maybe he's just...

42:53.267 --> 42:54.067
Leave it alone.

42:57.671 --> 42:58.472
Okay.

43:00.140 --> 43:03.310
Hey, hey, yo, I
think it's a cop.

43:03.343 --> 43:05.578
Hey man are you, are you a cop?

43:05.611 --> 43:07.213
Okay thank God.

43:07.246 --> 43:08.080
Can you help us?

43:08.114 --> 43:09.315
What's wrong?

43:09.348 --> 43:11.384
There's a dead guy
in the car and we're,

43:11.417 --> 43:12.451
we're stuck out here.

43:15.022 --> 43:15.854
Thanks.

43:22.093 --> 43:22.928
Hey man.

43:23.963 --> 43:24.763
Is there a problem?

43:24.796 --> 43:25.630
No.

43:26.631 --> 43:28.232
No problem.

43:28.265 --> 43:29.833
He's, he's in the car.

43:38.142 --> 43:39.409
Easy now.

43:39.442 --> 43:40.610
Shit.

43:40.643 --> 43:41.711
Or you're gonna
end up just like him.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.013
What the hell man?

43:43.047 --> 43:45.648
Now we're gonna do
this real nice and easy.

43:45.682 --> 43:48.751
Okay just, just
put down the gun.

43:49.719 --> 43:51.954
Next one's for you, law dog.

43:51.988 --> 43:53.990
My hands are in the
air, I'm not moving.

43:55.757 --> 43:56.558
Okay stud.

43:57.459 --> 43:58.260
You're up.

43:58.293 --> 43:59.094
What, what?

43:59.127 --> 44:00.329
Really slow now.

44:00.362 --> 44:01.496
I want you to reach

44:01.530 --> 44:03.898
and take Johnny's piece
and hand it to me.

44:03.931 --> 44:05.266
Just do what he says kid.

44:15.842 --> 44:16.676
There.

44:17.544 --> 44:18.745
I feel better already.

44:19.646 --> 44:21.514
Just so you don't get any ideas,

44:21.548 --> 44:23.750
I don't miss what I aim at.

44:25.151 --> 44:25.952
No ideas.

44:31.256 --> 44:32.124
Are we cool?

44:32.157 --> 44:33.325
Move.

44:33.359 --> 44:34.193
Both of ya.

44:44.268 --> 44:45.803
Try it now.

44:47.839 --> 44:49.041
Nothing.

44:49.074 --> 44:50.475
Piece of shit.

44:50.508 --> 44:52.509
You know we could've
walked back to town by now.

44:52.542 --> 44:54.511
Oh, and leave
my truck out here?

44:54.544 --> 44:56.713
Yeah, the hicks'll be using
it for target practice.

44:56.747 --> 44:57.648
I don't think so.

44:57.681 --> 44:58.715
Look, just crank it again.

45:00.217 --> 45:01.551
I've been fucking
trying, Buck.

45:07.156 --> 45:07.991
Buck?

45:17.632 --> 45:22.303
Oh my god.

45:29.978 --> 45:30.811
Who's out there?

45:32.013 --> 45:33.380
God dammit Smiley,
man, if that's you

45:33.414 --> 45:34.915
this shit ain't fucking funny.

45:47.727 --> 45:48.561
Hey.

45:50.030 --> 45:51.296
Tiler.

45:51.329 --> 45:52.165
- Tiler.
- Hmm?

45:53.598 --> 45:54.700
You're snoring.

45:54.733 --> 45:55.667
Babe.

45:55.701 --> 45:57.136
I'm sorry baby.

46:06.644 --> 46:08.212
Oh dammit, Tiler.

46:13.884 --> 46:16.187
Sorry, it's just one of
those things I can't help.

46:16.219 --> 46:18.288
No, I know.

46:18.321 --> 46:19.923
Where are you going?

46:19.957 --> 46:21.125
Gotta pee.

46:21.158 --> 46:22.993
Where are you going?

47:30.921 --> 47:31.755
Pam?

47:33.690 --> 47:34.525
Babe?

47:38.997 --> 47:39.829
Pam?

47:41.664 --> 47:42.899
No, no!

47:42.932 --> 47:43.766
No.

47:44.700 --> 47:45.535
Pam!

47:46.469 --> 47:47.804
No Pam.

47:47.837 --> 47:49.305
What hap?

47:49.338 --> 47:51.274
Pam, oh my god.

47:51.306 --> 47:52.707
No!

47:52.741 --> 47:53.575
No!

47:58.613 --> 47:59.414
Pam.

48:20.900 --> 48:21.868
You're back.

48:21.901 --> 48:23.204
Thank god, I was
getting nervous.

48:23.237 --> 48:24.038
What's wrong?

48:24.071 --> 48:25.538
Evening, y'all.

48:25.572 --> 48:27.639
Let me introduce you
to Johnny law dog.

48:28.540 --> 48:30.243
He's gonna be joining us.

48:30.276 --> 48:31.211
Ethan, what the hell's that?

48:31.244 --> 48:32.678
Just, just be cool.

48:32.711 --> 48:34.680
That's right,
cool as cucumbers.

48:34.713 --> 48:36.515
And we won't have
any more problems.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.156
Make sure you tie him
off nice and tight now.

48:45.389 --> 48:46.225
All finished?

48:47.358 --> 48:48.759
Yeah.

48:48.793 --> 48:50.062
That leaves only you.

48:50.095 --> 48:51.329
No.

48:51.361 --> 48:52.529
Come on man.

48:57.201 --> 48:58.401
- Dylan!
- What the hell, man?

48:58.435 --> 48:59.536
What?

48:59.569 --> 49:00.972
You act like I shot him.

49:01.005 --> 49:02.306
Hey, listen to me.

49:03.472 --> 49:04.874
This doesn't have
to go this way.

49:04.907 --> 49:06.977
Don't I know it, law dog.

49:07.010 --> 49:07.843
Don't I know it.

49:16.517 --> 49:18.020
Come on man, you're
taking our food.

49:18.053 --> 49:19.687
First rule of survival.

49:20.822 --> 49:23.625
Well folks, it's
been a real pleasure

49:23.658 --> 49:25.526
but I must be on my way.

49:31.933 --> 49:32.934
Come on boy.

49:49.882 --> 49:51.317
Come on boy.

49:51.350 --> 49:52.484
No!

49:52.517 --> 49:53.953
Come on.

49:55.288 --> 49:56.122
What?

50:05.596 --> 50:07.098
Go, go, go.

50:07.132 --> 50:08.333
Go, go, go!

50:13.671 --> 50:14.973
Ethan!

50:15.005 --> 50:16.073
Come on, come on,
come on, let's go!

50:16.106 --> 50:16.906
Come on!

50:16.941 --> 50:17.840
Let's go!

50:17.874 --> 50:20.110
Come on, let's go, let's go.

50:27.449 --> 50:28.251
Shit.

50:28.284 --> 50:29.085
Rose.

50:29.118 --> 50:30.286
Are you okay?

50:30.320 --> 50:31.154
Yeah, yeah, I just
took a bad step.

50:31.187 --> 50:32.422
Okay well let's move.

50:32.454 --> 50:33.855
Come on.

50:33.889 --> 50:35.724
- God.
- Worse than you thought?

50:35.757 --> 50:36.960
Yeah, I twisted it.

50:36.993 --> 50:37.927
It hurts like hell
when I try to move it.

50:37.961 --> 50:38.961
You guys go ahead.

50:38.994 --> 50:40.128
I'll do my best to keep up.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.096
No way.

50:41.129 --> 50:42.931
Yeah, we're not splitting up.

50:42.965 --> 50:45.499
Dammit Allie, you saw what
that thing did to Ethan.

50:45.533 --> 50:46.667
That's why we're
not leaving you.

50:46.701 --> 50:47.635
No, go!

50:47.668 --> 50:49.104
Hey kid, what's your name?

50:49.137 --> 50:50.905
- Dylan?
- Dylan come gimme a hand.

50:52.239 --> 50:53.140
Okay, is this any better?

50:53.174 --> 50:54.408
Oh, it hurts.

50:54.442 --> 50:55.542
Okay, we gotta move slow,

50:55.575 --> 50:56.210
but we're gonna
keep moving, okay?

50:56.243 --> 50:56.910
Okay.

51:18.097 --> 51:21.433
Well, look what we got here.

51:29.273 --> 51:31.275
- This is it.
- This is what?

51:35.413 --> 51:37.148
Here, gimme your hand.

51:37.181 --> 51:38.449
Thanks, gimme a second.

51:40.783 --> 51:42.119
Sit down.

51:46.123 --> 51:48.758
Search and rescue's been
abandoned for a while now.

51:48.791 --> 51:51.427
There might be a first aid
kit around here somewhere.

51:56.298 --> 51:57.565
Any water?

51:57.599 --> 51:58.600
I'm not sure.

51:58.633 --> 51:59.734
You'd have to look around.

52:02.371 --> 52:04.872
Let me see how bad it is.

52:04.905 --> 52:07.242
How can you see
what you're doing?

52:07.275 --> 52:08.376
Ha!

52:08.410 --> 52:10.979
And let there be light.

52:11.012 --> 52:12.013
Are you crazy, Dylan?

52:12.047 --> 52:13.081
Put that out.

52:13.114 --> 52:14.516
- Why?
- You don't think

52:14.548 --> 52:16.016
that's gonna attract whatever
that thing is out there?

52:16.050 --> 52:19.652
How are we supposed to fix
your sister's leg in the dark?

52:19.685 --> 52:20.653
He's got a point.

52:23.424 --> 52:24.324
Okay.

52:24.358 --> 52:26.659
I'm gonna have to set this.

52:26.692 --> 52:28.593
Yeah, okay.

52:28.627 --> 52:29.594
It's gonna hurt.

52:29.628 --> 52:30.729
I know, yeah.

52:30.762 --> 52:32.564
Okay.

52:32.597 --> 52:33.399
- Ready?
- Yeah.

52:33.433 --> 52:34.699
Just do it already.

52:34.733 --> 52:35.634
Okay here we go.

52:36.601 --> 52:38.404
Okay.

52:38.438 --> 52:40.738
Okay, the worst of
it's behind you.

52:40.771 --> 52:41.572
What now?

52:43.408 --> 52:46.445
Splint, hopefully
some bandages.

52:46.478 --> 52:48.447
No, I mean, what
are we gonna do?

52:48.480 --> 52:49.613
What's the plan?

52:52.049 --> 52:53.716
We're gonna head
back into town.

52:54.684 --> 52:56.554
Try and find some help.

52:58.222 --> 52:59.023
Ethan.

53:01.791 --> 53:04.827
Oh my god, I can't
believe he's dead.

53:22.978 --> 53:24.612
Find anything good?

53:24.645 --> 53:26.747
Should make for a
halfway decent splint.

53:27.781 --> 53:29.183
So have you ever seen anything

53:29.217 --> 53:31.519
like whatever the hell
that was back there?

53:31.552 --> 53:32.786
No.

53:32.819 --> 53:35.323
It's definitely no
animal I've ever seen.

53:35.356 --> 53:37.024
Yeah, almost looks like...

53:37.058 --> 53:38.392
Something out of this world.

53:38.426 --> 53:39.625
Come on, that's crazy.

53:41.027 --> 53:43.530
I'm sure what the
hell that thing was.

53:43.563 --> 53:44.965
There's one thing I do know,

53:46.765 --> 53:47.633
it's a hunter.

53:47.666 --> 53:49.102
And we're the prey.

53:49.136 --> 53:50.537
Yeah, something like that.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.339
Then why are we holed up
here like some sitting ducks?

53:53.372 --> 53:55.174
Hey, that girl's really hurt.

53:55.207 --> 53:57.209
When she's up for
it, we'll move.

53:57.243 --> 54:00.479
Look man, I feel I gotta be
straight with you, all right?

54:00.513 --> 54:02.281
Whatever the odds are
about running that thing

54:02.314 --> 54:03.714
and making it back to town,

54:03.747 --> 54:06.117
they get substantially better
if we're not slowed down

54:06.151 --> 54:08.219
by Rose and her busted leg.

54:08.253 --> 54:09.653
Some friend you are.

54:09.686 --> 54:11.456
I don't even know her, man.

54:12.557 --> 54:13.757
- Wow.
- I mean,

54:13.790 --> 54:15.359
I've been trying to
tap the younger sister

54:15.392 --> 54:17.161
but she's been blue
balling me all semester.

54:17.194 --> 54:18.694
So no great loss there either.

54:18.728 --> 54:19.496
Am I right?

54:19.530 --> 54:20.998
Listen, pal.

54:21.031 --> 54:22.732
If you think I'm gonna keep
you from leaving, I'm not.

54:22.765 --> 54:25.068
If you wanna go, go.

54:25.102 --> 54:26.303
I don't know the way.

54:26.336 --> 54:28.770
Head south and
hope for the best.

54:28.803 --> 54:30.339
Good luck to ya.

54:33.708 --> 54:35.777
Jesus man, tight enough?

54:35.810 --> 54:37.812
You're cutting off
my circulation.

54:37.846 --> 54:38.680
Sorry partner.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.650
You already broke
outta one clinker

54:41.682 --> 54:43.084
and I ain't about
to take no chances.

54:43.118 --> 54:45.220
Fuck man, you gotta hear me.

54:45.253 --> 54:46.687
We ain't safe here.

54:46.720 --> 54:50.325
No worry son, old Roy
gonna take good care of you.

54:50.358 --> 54:52.359
Just gotta get that
truck started first.

54:53.726 --> 54:54.995
Ah dammit.

54:55.029 --> 54:57.198
That's not gonna
do any good, man.

54:57.231 --> 54:59.300
You're not gonna get
this thing to start.

55:00.267 --> 55:01.468
Ye of little faith.

55:01.502 --> 55:03.603
You don't understand
man, nothing's working.

55:03.636 --> 55:05.271
No phones, no flashlights,

55:05.305 --> 55:08.807
anything with electronics've
been fried by the monster.

55:08.840 --> 55:09.741
The monster?

55:09.775 --> 55:10.742
Whatever you wanna call it.

55:10.776 --> 55:12.711
This thing that attacked us.

55:12.744 --> 55:15.414
Trust me man, you don't
wanna cross paths with it.

55:18.951 --> 55:20.552
Yeah, don't fret, son.

55:20.586 --> 55:21.886
Old Roy's not gonna let
nothing happen to you

55:21.920 --> 55:23.989
'fore he can
collect that reward.

55:25.723 --> 55:28.725
But, it would appear you're
in the right about the truck.

55:28.758 --> 55:29.594
So...

55:34.065 --> 55:34.999
we walk out.

55:36.534 --> 55:37.435
On your feet, now.

56:07.528 --> 56:09.330
Are we ever gonna
get out of here?

56:10.498 --> 56:12.133
How you feeling?

56:12.166 --> 56:13.067
Better.

56:13.101 --> 56:14.668
Will you give it a shot?

56:14.701 --> 56:15.936
Yeah.

56:15.969 --> 56:17.471
Finally!

56:32.585 --> 56:33.719
How much further?

56:33.753 --> 56:34.654
Just over the
bluff is the freeway.

56:34.687 --> 56:36.022
Then it's all pavement, okay?

56:36.055 --> 56:36.956
God.

56:36.989 --> 56:38.491
Are you okay to keep going?

56:38.524 --> 56:40.458
Yeah just, just
gimme a minute.

56:40.492 --> 56:41.293
Sit down.

56:41.326 --> 56:42.394
Shit.

56:42.427 --> 56:43.228
What was that Dylan?

56:43.261 --> 56:44.562
I didn't say anything.

56:44.596 --> 56:46.097
Unbelievable.

56:46.131 --> 56:47.299
What the hell is your problem?

56:47.332 --> 56:48.832
Look, she's just
slowing us down, okay?

56:48.866 --> 56:49.668
Give her a break.

56:49.701 --> 56:50.833
She's hurt.

56:50.867 --> 56:51.769
I can't believe
you're being like this.

56:51.801 --> 56:53.003
Yeah?

56:53.037 --> 56:54.471
Well believe it, 'cause
there's no way in hell

56:54.505 --> 56:55.572
I'm gonna die out here
in the middle of nowhere.

56:55.606 --> 56:56.839
How can you be so selfish?

56:56.873 --> 56:58.175
I'm selfish
'cause I wanna live?

56:58.208 --> 56:59.043
No, selfish because you...

56:59.076 --> 57:00.511
He's right.

57:00.544 --> 57:02.645
I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up.

57:02.679 --> 57:03.879
Stop talking like that.

57:03.913 --> 57:05.114
Just rest here for a second

57:05.148 --> 57:06.449
and we'll help you
the rest of the way.

57:06.482 --> 57:07.283
Right?

57:07.317 --> 57:08.151
Yeah, whatever.

57:10.253 --> 57:11.054
Shit.

57:11.087 --> 57:11.887
Run, run, run!

57:13.122 --> 57:15.524
- Run, run, run, run.
- Shit.

57:18.826 --> 57:20.262
Almost back to town.

57:22.830 --> 57:25.200
Hey, keep moving.

57:25.233 --> 57:26.535
Whoa.

57:26.567 --> 57:27.867
You see that?

57:27.902 --> 57:29.637
- What?
- Somebody's coming.

57:32.206 --> 57:33.307
God damn you're jumpy.

57:33.341 --> 57:34.408
See? There.

57:35.309 --> 57:36.477
Could be him.

57:36.510 --> 57:37.311
Him?

57:37.345 --> 57:38.179
The monster, man.

57:39.878 --> 57:41.214
The monster?

57:41.247 --> 57:42.215
Keep moving!

57:42.248 --> 57:43.149
No, fuck that.

57:43.183 --> 57:44.084
You wanna shoot me, go ahead.

57:44.117 --> 57:45.018
But I'm not taking another step.

57:45.051 --> 57:47.120
Don't tempt me, tough guy.

57:47.153 --> 57:47.987
Hey!

57:49.155 --> 57:50.090
Who's out there?

57:50.123 --> 57:52.391
- Quiet man.
- Shut it.

57:53.625 --> 57:54.526
- Hell.
- Oh gees.

57:54.560 --> 57:56.295
Just a skinny kid.

57:56.328 --> 57:57.363
Hey.

57:57.396 --> 57:58.230
Howdy.

57:59.164 --> 58:00.933
- You.
- Hey kid.

58:00.966 --> 58:03.668
Mister, watch this
guy, he tried to rob us.

58:03.701 --> 58:06.070
Don't you worry boy, I
got him well under control.

58:06.104 --> 58:06.904
Where are you taking him?

58:06.938 --> 58:07.839
Back to town.

58:07.871 --> 58:08.806
Turn him into the sheriff.

58:08.840 --> 58:09.941
Can I tag along?

58:09.974 --> 58:11.042
Suit yourself.

58:11.075 --> 58:12.443
But I ain't
splitting the reward.

58:12.477 --> 58:13.711
Whatever.

58:13.745 --> 58:15.178
I just need to find
my way back to town.

58:16.613 --> 58:17.414
Move.

58:18.682 --> 58:19.583
Well come on then.

58:27.356 --> 58:28.424
Wait, wait, wait.

58:28.457 --> 58:31.660
What?

58:31.694 --> 58:32.795
We're going the wrong way.

58:32.828 --> 58:35.030
This is, this is
further into the desert.

58:35.064 --> 58:35.931
- No.
- Oh shit.

58:37.533 --> 58:39.167
With all the confusion
I lost my bearing.

58:39.200 --> 58:40.835
Well which way's
the right way?

58:43.037 --> 58:44.539
I don't know.

58:44.572 --> 58:45.473
It's hard to tell.

58:47.675 --> 58:48.510
Shit!

58:52.112 --> 58:53.080
I'm really sorry.

59:09.996 --> 59:12.098
It's definitely past midnight.

59:12.131 --> 59:13.032
Yeah.

59:13.065 --> 59:14.133
It means it's the 11th.

59:16.535 --> 59:18.403
It's my daughter's birthday.

59:18.437 --> 59:19.271
Oh.

59:19.304 --> 59:21.039
How old is she?

59:25.043 --> 59:26.244
She would've been six.

59:30.916 --> 59:31.749
Would have?

59:33.250 --> 59:37.421
She passed away
four months ago.

59:38.655 --> 59:41.024
Oh, I'm sorry.

59:42.826 --> 59:46.196
I figured if I came
back to work early,

59:46.229 --> 59:49.032
kept myself busy, that would've
been the right decision.

59:50.866 --> 59:55.304
But after today, I'm having
second thoughts about that.

1:00:00.642 --> 1:00:03.411
Okay, let's try
this again, okay?

1:00:04.545 --> 1:00:07.248
Well if we head
that way we're liable.

1:00:07.281 --> 1:00:08.917
to run into that thing again.

1:00:09.851 --> 1:00:10.852
Yeah, you're right.

1:00:14.554 --> 1:00:15.755
We're gonna go this way.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:20.594
And that thing, I noticed
the last few shots

1:00:20.627 --> 1:00:23.597
that I put into it, it
seemed to slow it down.

1:00:23.630 --> 1:00:25.967
Hopefully a couple more
will stop it for good.

1:00:25.999 --> 1:00:27.333
You think so?

1:00:28.534 --> 1:00:29.568
I'm gonna hope so.

1:00:31.003 --> 1:00:31.837
Come on.

1:00:35.174 --> 1:00:37.576
Hey man, what's your name?

1:00:37.610 --> 1:00:38.878
Don't worry about it.

1:00:38.911 --> 1:00:41.346
Anyway, you saw that thing.

1:00:41.379 --> 1:00:43.581
Can you please explain
to Grizzly Adams here

1:00:43.615 --> 1:00:44.582
what we're up against?

1:00:44.616 --> 1:00:46.184
You should stop talking.

1:00:46.217 --> 1:00:48.753
I'm trying to tell him
blunderbuss won't save us

1:00:48.786 --> 1:00:50.288
if we come across it again.

1:00:50.321 --> 1:00:54.124
Hey, one more word and I
swear to god I'll kill you.

1:00:54.157 --> 1:00:55.526
Yeah, well that thing

1:00:55.559 --> 1:00:57.394
has already killed
two of us already,

1:00:57.427 --> 1:01:00.364
so I think it's safe
to say if it finds us

1:01:00.397 --> 1:01:01.565
we're all fucked.

1:01:01.598 --> 1:01:02.431
What?

1:01:03.566 --> 1:01:05.434
Now you've seen this
monster man too?

1:01:05.468 --> 1:01:06.636
Yeah.

1:01:06.669 --> 1:01:08.538
Well I don't care
what's out here.

1:01:08.571 --> 1:01:11.875
Ain't nothing keeping
me from my reward money.

1:01:13.877 --> 1:01:15.410
Speaking of the devil.

1:01:16.545 --> 1:01:18.246
What the hell is that?

1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:19.314
Shoot it!

1:01:20.482 --> 1:01:22.217
Come on man, untie me.

1:01:22.250 --> 1:01:23.718
Why, so you can ditch
us like last time?

1:01:23.752 --> 1:01:25.654
Look, the only way we're
gonna survive this thing

1:01:25.687 --> 1:01:27.187
is if all hands are on deck.

1:01:29.925 --> 1:01:31.725
Jesus kid at least
gimme a fighting chance

1:01:31.759 --> 1:01:32.693
against that thing.

1:01:36.664 --> 1:01:37.765
Think you can live through
this without my help?

1:01:37.798 --> 1:01:40.166
Now fucking untie me!

1:01:40.199 --> 1:01:41.434
Okay.

1:01:42.335 --> 1:01:44.038
This way, old boy's done for.

1:01:45.238 --> 1:01:46.706
Where do you
think it came from?

1:01:46.739 --> 1:01:49.676
Well I've heard
stories over the years

1:01:49.709 --> 1:01:52.778
about sightings or whatever
you wanna call 'em.

1:01:52.811 --> 1:01:54.513
Sightings?

1:01:54.546 --> 1:01:57.616
Never really thought
about it until tonight.

1:01:57.649 --> 1:02:00.118
Wait, you mean like?

1:02:00.152 --> 1:02:02.055
Like aliens.

1:02:02.087 --> 1:02:03.254
That's crazy.

1:02:05.756 --> 1:02:06.925
Do you smell that?

1:02:06.959 --> 1:02:07.792
Yeah.

1:02:09.594 --> 1:02:11.228
You asked me how it got here.

1:02:11.262 --> 1:02:13.164
It has to travel somehow, right?

1:02:13.197 --> 1:02:15.066
Yeah, like a flying saucer?

1:02:15.098 --> 1:02:17.300
A spacecraft of some kind.

1:02:17.334 --> 1:02:18.668
Yeah, I wonder.

1:02:19.803 --> 1:02:21.271
What?

1:02:21.304 --> 1:02:24.574
Well, this afternoon we
were at the lookout peak

1:02:24.608 --> 1:02:27.043
and we saw something
fall outta the sky.

1:02:27.077 --> 1:02:28.444
Not sure what it was though,

1:02:28.477 --> 1:02:31.146
but it landed
pretty close to us.

1:02:32.581 --> 1:02:34.884
Well I have a feeling
we're about to find out.

1:02:36.418 --> 1:02:37.219
Where are we going?

1:02:37.252 --> 1:02:38.153
To get my gun.

1:02:38.187 --> 1:02:39.088
What good is that gonna do?

1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:40.521
Better to have it than not.

1:02:40.555 --> 1:02:42.724
Besides, the bullets back
there hurt it more than before.

1:02:42.757 --> 1:02:43.825
Yeah, it did look that way.

1:02:43.858 --> 1:02:44.659
See?

1:02:44.692 --> 1:02:45.660
We agree on stuff.

1:02:45.693 --> 1:02:47.195
This partnership
might just work.

1:02:50.631 --> 1:02:53.367
You should gather any supplies
you can fit in that bag.

1:02:57.804 --> 1:02:59.406
You pretty much
too everything else.

1:02:59.439 --> 1:03:00.407
Okay then.

1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:01.274
Let's go.

1:03:08.848 --> 1:03:09.682
Hey.

1:03:12.685 --> 1:03:13.653
We gotta get going.

1:03:18.556 --> 1:03:19.992
I can't do this.

1:03:20.026 --> 1:03:20.993
What happened?

1:03:21.027 --> 1:03:23.395
My sister's dead and Ethan is.

1:03:24.429 --> 1:03:25.330
Listen to me, okay?

1:03:25.363 --> 1:03:26.630
I know it seems hard right now

1:03:26.664 --> 1:03:27.698
but we gotta keep moving.

1:03:27.731 --> 1:03:28.933
Do we have any other plan

1:03:28.967 --> 1:03:31.235
besides wandering
around in the dark?

1:03:31.268 --> 1:03:34.139
We're gonna stick to my plan
and that's to move into town.

1:03:35.874 --> 1:03:38.608
I hardly got to see her since
she moved away to college.

1:03:38.641 --> 1:03:41.011
This trip was supposed to
be a fun weekend together.

1:03:41.045 --> 1:03:42.745
And she just got engaged and...

1:03:42.779 --> 1:03:43.713
I get it.

1:03:44.882 --> 1:03:47.383
Sometimes losing the
ones we love the most

1:03:47.417 --> 1:03:49.318
is what life hits
us the hardest with.

1:03:50.585 --> 1:03:51.420
Yeah.

1:03:54.090 --> 1:03:55.858
And to think.

1:03:55.892 --> 1:03:57.093
What?

1:03:57.126 --> 1:03:58.627
I know you came
here to meet that boy.

1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:00.863
If I see him again
I'm kicking him in his nuts.

1:04:00.897 --> 1:04:02.430
Come on.

1:04:04.132 --> 1:04:05.332
So what happened?

1:04:05.366 --> 1:04:07.135
How'd you get separated
from your friends?

1:04:07.169 --> 1:04:08.602
- I left 'em.
- Why?

1:04:08.636 --> 1:04:12.707
Well her sister broke her leg
and started slowing us down.

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.242
I told 'em leave her ass behind.

1:04:16.276 --> 1:04:19.146
Survival of the
fittest, common sense.

1:04:19.180 --> 1:04:20.114
They didn't wanna leave her.

1:04:20.147 --> 1:04:21.781
So I took off.

1:04:21.815 --> 1:04:23.416
Damn.

1:04:23.450 --> 1:04:24.684
And I thought I was cold.

1:04:24.718 --> 1:04:25.920
Whatever.

1:04:25.953 --> 1:04:27.820
So what happened to your
friend that was shot?

1:04:29.956 --> 1:04:30.756
He's dead.

1:04:30.789 --> 1:04:31.858
No shit.

1:04:33.059 --> 1:04:33.893
How'd that happen?

1:04:33.927 --> 1:04:35.095
Running from the law.

1:04:36.328 --> 1:04:37.563
Trying to get to freedom.

1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:43.135
What's that?

1:04:44.937 --> 1:04:46.171
No idea.

1:04:46.205 --> 1:04:48.073
Looks like campers.

1:04:48.107 --> 1:04:49.340
You know what that means.

1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:51.475
More supplies.

1:04:59.951 --> 1:05:01.251
Oh wow.

1:05:03.186 --> 1:05:04.054
Come on.

1:05:06.489 --> 1:05:07.690
Are you crazy?

1:05:07.723 --> 1:05:10.193
I'm not getting any
closer to that thing.

1:05:10.227 --> 1:05:11.393
We gotta keep moving.

1:05:13.629 --> 1:05:15.164
Oh boy.

1:05:15.197 --> 1:05:16.198
Oh shit.

1:05:16.232 --> 1:05:17.900
There's another one.

1:05:19.567 --> 1:05:22.737
Ah, this is not
definitely not good.

1:05:26.041 --> 1:05:26.941
Ew.

1:05:26.975 --> 1:05:28.308
I think I just stepped in poo.

1:05:29.476 --> 1:05:30.711
I don't
think that's poo.

1:05:30.744 --> 1:05:32.379
At least not from any
animal I've ever seen.

1:05:32.412 --> 1:05:34.249
I just stepped in alien shit?

1:05:36.151 --> 1:05:38.284
I'll find something to
help you clean it, okay?

1:05:41.587 --> 1:05:42.856
Did you
find something?

1:05:42.890 --> 1:05:44.524
Yeah, I
found something.

1:05:47.194 --> 1:05:48.128
What's that?

1:05:49.529 --> 1:05:50.395
I have no idea.

1:05:54.133 --> 1:05:56.068
You know what I think,

1:05:57.469 --> 1:06:02.339
whatever that thing is, was
already hurt when this crashed.

1:06:03.507 --> 1:06:04.408
What are
you getting at here?

1:06:04.441 --> 1:06:06.677
Hopefully it is already hurt.

1:06:08.180 --> 1:06:11.415
If we're lucky it's dying.

1:06:14.952 --> 1:06:15.752
Come on.

1:06:24.327 --> 1:06:26.029
You hear that?

1:06:26.062 --> 1:06:26.863
We're not alone.

1:06:26.896 --> 1:06:27.864
Come on.

1:06:27.897 --> 1:06:28.831
What the!

1:06:29.731 --> 1:06:30.666
You gotta be kidding me.

1:06:30.699 --> 1:06:31.733
Stop, both of you.

1:06:33.002 --> 1:06:34.037
Listen out of
the good ear now.

1:06:34.070 --> 1:06:35.271
You're lucky he's here

1:06:35.305 --> 1:06:36.772
or I'd be kicking
your ass right now.

1:06:36.805 --> 1:06:39.007
What's with everyone trying
to kick my ass tonight?

1:06:39.041 --> 1:06:39.942
Shit.

1:06:39.975 --> 1:06:41.043
What brings you guys here?

1:06:41.076 --> 1:06:41.877
To ask you the same thing.

1:06:41.910 --> 1:06:43.045
Following the smoke?

1:06:44.645 --> 1:06:46.081
What the hell is that thing?

1:06:46.114 --> 1:06:47.115
You should put your
gun down and go find out.

1:06:47.149 --> 1:06:49.617
Oh I'll find out with my gun.

1:06:49.650 --> 1:06:51.052
And I'll be taking yours too.

1:06:51.085 --> 1:06:52.286
Go on, take his gun.

1:06:53.353 --> 1:06:54.821
Sorry to do this to ya again

1:06:54.856 --> 1:06:57.591
but I can't have you shoot
me while my back is turned.

1:06:57.624 --> 1:06:59.894
All right, let's
go have a look see.

1:06:59.927 --> 1:07:01.128
Move.

1:07:01.162 --> 1:07:02.528
I can't
believe you left us.

1:07:02.561 --> 1:07:03.930
Your sister
would've gotten us all killed.

1:07:03.964 --> 1:07:05.464
You're an
unbelievable asshole.

1:07:05.497 --> 1:07:06.699
Yeah, but I'm alive.

1:07:06.732 --> 1:07:09.768
Holy, this can't be
what it looks like.

1:07:09.802 --> 1:07:11.704
I'm pretty sure
that's how it got here.

1:07:11.737 --> 1:07:14.006
He really is a
freaking space man.

1:07:14.039 --> 1:07:15.473
Why don't you go
take a closer look?

1:07:15.506 --> 1:07:16.441
It found us.

1:07:17.609 --> 1:07:18.710
What the hell
is it waiting for?

1:07:18.743 --> 1:07:21.013
I'd say it's
trying to size us up,

1:07:21.046 --> 1:07:22.614
decide which one's
the weakest link.

1:07:22.647 --> 1:07:23.781
I'm defenseless here, man.

1:07:23.815 --> 1:07:25.017
Help me out.

1:07:25.050 --> 1:07:26.583
All I'm trying to do
is make my way to Mexico

1:07:26.617 --> 1:07:28.552
and both you and this thing
stand in the way of that.

1:07:28.585 --> 1:07:31.222
So no, officer, I will not
give you your gun back.

1:07:31.256 --> 1:07:32.257
What are you
waiting for, dude?

1:07:32.290 --> 1:07:33.157
Shoot!

1:07:33.191 --> 1:07:33.992
Here we go.

1:07:34.859 --> 1:07:36.593
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:07:45.668 --> 1:07:46.502
What's wrong?

1:07:46.535 --> 1:07:47.403
I'm tired of running.

1:07:47.436 --> 1:07:48.604
We gotta keep moving

1:07:48.638 --> 1:07:49.405
or that thing's gonna
catch up with us.

1:07:49.438 --> 1:07:50.339
Exactly, my point.

1:07:50.373 --> 1:07:51.573
What are you talking about?

1:07:51.606 --> 1:07:52.774
It doesn't matter
how much you run,

1:07:52.807 --> 1:07:54.243
that thing's just
gonna catch up to us.

1:07:54.277 --> 1:07:56.178
If we just stay here, that
doesn't change anything.

1:07:56.212 --> 1:07:57.346
Where are you going?

1:07:57.380 --> 1:07:58.613
I don't know!

1:07:58.647 --> 1:08:00.782
We have no weapons,
we gotta keep running.

1:08:00.815 --> 1:08:01.816
I heard something, move!

1:08:01.851 --> 1:08:02.951
Come here, move, move.

1:08:06.820 --> 1:08:08.023
Hey scumbag.

1:08:13.427 --> 1:08:15.695
Put that thing down
before you hurt yourself.

1:08:15.728 --> 1:08:17.164
You've been nothing but
trouble since we've met you.

1:08:17.197 --> 1:08:19.666
Just looking out for
the one that matters most.

1:08:21.402 --> 1:08:22.303
Me.

1:08:22.336 --> 1:08:23.770
Look where it's got you.

1:08:23.803 --> 1:08:25.205
Okay, gimme the gun, gimme
the gun, gimme the gun.

1:08:26.738 --> 1:08:29.242
Just a few more shots and I
think we can kill that thing.

1:08:29.275 --> 1:08:30.709
What are you saying?

1:08:30.742 --> 1:08:31.510
We can try to set up a
trap for it, like an ambush.

1:08:31.543 --> 1:08:32.912
That's crazy!

1:08:32.946 --> 1:08:34.047
Girl has a point.

1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:34.981
Shut up!

1:08:35.014 --> 1:08:36.481
I've had enough outta you.

1:08:36.515 --> 1:08:38.016
I've been outgunned or
outnumbered or outmatched

1:08:38.050 --> 1:08:38.951
my whole life.

1:08:38.984 --> 1:08:39.885
The only reason I'm still here

1:08:39.918 --> 1:08:41.019
is 'cause I know a thing or two

1:08:41.053 --> 1:08:42.520
about this cat and mouse game.

1:08:42.553 --> 1:08:44.323
Okay, you know what,
that's enough convict wisdom

1:08:44.356 --> 1:08:45.324
for the night.

1:08:45.357 --> 1:08:46.291
Okay, we're leaving, let's go.

1:08:46.325 --> 1:08:48.459
Come on man, think about it.

1:08:48.492 --> 1:08:49.894
Girl's right.

1:08:49.927 --> 1:08:51.262
We've already managed
to hurt it bad.

1:08:51.295 --> 1:08:53.763
All we gotta do now
is finish it off.

1:08:53.797 --> 1:08:56.400
Look here, it's always
attacked us one at a time.

1:08:56.434 --> 1:08:57.634
Say we strategize a little bit

1:08:57.667 --> 1:08:59.170
we might just get the
upper hand for once.

1:08:59.203 --> 1:09:01.205
We tried running, Matt.

1:09:01.238 --> 1:09:03.672
That thing killed Rose.

1:09:03.706 --> 1:09:05.241
If we're gonna die tonight,

1:09:05.275 --> 1:09:07.010
I'd rather die
trying to fight back.

1:09:07.043 --> 1:09:08.744
Listen to yourselves.

1:09:08.777 --> 1:09:10.746
It's crazy talk.

1:09:10.779 --> 1:09:11.982
I'm leaving.

1:09:12.015 --> 1:09:13.283
Law dog's afraid
to stand and fight.

1:09:14.383 --> 1:09:15.884
Coward.

1:09:15.918 --> 1:09:16.919
I told you to sit there
and keep your mouth shut.

1:09:16.952 --> 1:09:17.853
Prove me wrong then.

1:09:17.886 --> 1:09:19.188
So what if we run, Matt?

1:09:19.221 --> 1:09:21.522
If we're lucky enough
to make it to town

1:09:21.556 --> 1:09:24.026
that thing's just
gonna follow us.

1:09:24.059 --> 1:09:26.160
Right now there's only
three of us in danger.

1:09:26.194 --> 1:09:28.997
But as soon as you hit
civilization those numbers go up.

1:09:30.697 --> 1:09:31.531
Fine.

1:09:34.369 --> 1:09:35.203
Fine.

1:09:36.770 --> 1:09:38.105
We'll try it your way.

1:09:42.575 --> 1:09:45.078
So what's the plan, law dog?

1:09:45.112 --> 1:09:50.116
First things first, you're
gonna stop calling me that.

1:10:33.456 --> 1:10:34.290
Guys, look.

1:10:34.323 --> 1:10:35.557
Oh wow.

1:10:35.590 --> 1:10:37.559
Whatever the creature
did it must've worn off.

1:10:37.592 --> 1:10:38.527
It didn't wear off.

1:10:38.559 --> 1:10:39.760
It's dying and losing its power.

1:10:39.794 --> 1:10:40.594
Shit.

1:10:41.796 --> 1:10:43.697
We just might make it
through this after all.

1:10:45.067 --> 1:10:46.634
617 to dispatch, do you copy?

1:10:47.568 --> 1:10:49.970
Dispatch 617, do you copy?

1:10:50.004 --> 1:10:51.272
Shit!

1:10:51.305 --> 1:10:52.206
The power
must've went off.

1:10:52.239 --> 1:10:54.141
Or they're all dead.

1:10:54.175 --> 1:10:55.109
Gimme your phone.

1:10:59.746 --> 1:11:00.580
There's no signal.

1:11:00.613 --> 1:11:01.915
We get back into town...

1:11:01.948 --> 1:11:03.715
Anything to avoid a fight.

1:11:04.884 --> 1:11:06.752
Why can't you see
this for what it is?

1:11:06.785 --> 1:11:07.686
Thing's on its knees.

1:11:07.719 --> 1:11:08.888
Now it's time to finish it off.

1:11:08.922 --> 1:11:10.256
I'm taking you both into town

1:11:10.290 --> 1:11:11.191
and we're waiting for backup.

1:11:11.224 --> 1:11:12.658
And that's it.

1:11:12.691 --> 1:11:14.625
Then remove the cuffs and
gimme my gun so I can finish it.

1:11:14.659 --> 1:11:16.594
I know when to scrap
and when to scurry

1:11:16.627 --> 1:11:18.931
and now's not the
time to scurry.

1:11:20.365 --> 1:11:24.169
You know what, if you wanna
deal with this thing so bad,

1:11:25.204 --> 1:11:26.137
you be my guest.

1:11:27.371 --> 1:11:28.372
Best of luck.

1:11:30.707 --> 1:11:31.542
I can't.

1:11:32.809 --> 1:11:34.011
Run along now, friend.

1:11:34.045 --> 1:11:34.912
Sorry Matt.

1:11:35.779 --> 1:11:37.448
You listen to me, okay?

1:11:37.482 --> 1:11:39.316
This is a big mistake.

1:11:40.584 --> 1:11:41.384
Okay?

1:11:41.418 --> 1:11:42.219
You're gonna get hurt.

1:11:42.252 --> 1:11:43.587
Maybe.

1:12:02.904 --> 1:12:04.339
Looks like he
was expecting us.

1:12:04.372 --> 1:12:06.207
So much for the
element of surprise.

1:12:06.241 --> 1:12:07.075
Hey cowboy.

1:12:09.110 --> 1:12:10.345
You don't look so good.

1:12:11.412 --> 1:12:12.646
All right, he's getting
ready to strike.

1:12:12.679 --> 1:12:14.448
When he does I'll go
left, you go right.

1:12:14.481 --> 1:12:15.415
Understand?

1:12:15.449 --> 1:12:16.250
Yeah.

1:12:41.772 --> 1:12:42.773
Come on man, take him out.

1:12:42.806 --> 1:12:43.707
What are you waiting for?

1:12:43.741 --> 1:12:44.943
Gotta get a clear shot.

1:12:44.976 --> 1:12:46.578
I can't hold him
much longer, dammit.

1:12:46.611 --> 1:12:47.579
Take the shot.

1:13:07.330 --> 1:13:08.498
You alright?

1:13:10.567 --> 1:13:11.534
Oh shit.

1:13:11.568 --> 1:13:12.602
I got shot.

1:13:12.635 --> 1:13:13.768
Yeah.

1:13:13.801 --> 1:13:15.037
I thought you were dead.

1:13:15.070 --> 1:13:17.673
Takes more'n a gunshot
wound to get rid of me.

1:13:20.842 --> 1:13:22.644
Come on, we gotta
take care of this.

1:13:26.047 --> 1:13:27.781
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1:13:35.223 --> 1:13:36.157
Is it dead?

1:13:38.992 --> 1:13:41.595
Yeah, looks that way.

1:13:41.628 --> 1:13:43.196
Jake saved my life.

1:13:45.232 --> 1:13:47.100
Yeah, I guess
he did, didn't he?

1:13:47.133 --> 1:13:49.402
You two cut
that hero shit out.

1:13:56.108 --> 1:13:58.911
Hey, are you sure we're
heading the right way?

1:13:58.944 --> 1:14:00.279
Trust me.

1:14:00.312 --> 1:14:01.213
I've found my bearings.

1:14:01.247 --> 1:14:02.814
Don't worry, if we gets lost,

1:14:02.847 --> 1:14:04.816
I can always find
my way to Mexico.

1:14:04.849 --> 1:14:06.551
Still trying to escape?

1:14:06.584 --> 1:14:08.319
I ain't going back to jail.

1:14:10.754 --> 1:14:11.656
Did you hear that?

1:14:11.689 --> 1:14:13.991
Man you must have dog ears.

1:14:14.024 --> 1:14:15.425
Yeah, that must be
the first responders.

1:14:15.459 --> 1:14:16.293
Come on.

1:14:23.934 --> 1:14:25.635
Holy shit.

1:14:25.668 --> 1:14:26.569
I'll say.

1:14:27.503 --> 1:14:28.671
It's like no one responded.

1:14:28.704 --> 1:14:30.606
They're all fighting
for their lives.

1:14:34.277 --> 1:14:38.246
Looks like the fight's
just getting started.

1:20:50.454 --> 1:20:53.323
Hey Tommy, did you remember

1:20:53.357 --> 1:20:55.325
to take the car
into Buck's Brakes?

1:20:55.359 --> 1:20:56.326
They're kind of old.

1:20:57.361 --> 1:20:59.663
Darn it, Sally.

1:20:59.696 --> 1:21:01.099
The brakes are fine.

1:21:01.131 --> 1:21:02.833
These brakes are good.

1:21:02.866 --> 1:21:06.435
Can you stop being
such a nervous Nelly?

1:21:06.469 --> 1:21:07.938
Look out!

1:21:15.011 --> 1:21:17.679
Why?

1:21:18.948 --> 1:21:21.249
Don't let this happen to you.

1:21:21.282 --> 1:21:22.717
All this could've been prevented

1:21:22.751 --> 1:21:25.352
by a trip to Buck's Brakes.

1:21:25.386 --> 1:21:28.790

Buck's personal guarantee.
