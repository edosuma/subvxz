(Bell)

00:15.812 --> 00:18.600
- That's pretty cool.
- I'm telling you, man.

00:18.732 --> 00:19.847
See you, bro!

00:19.983 --> 00:21.014
Later, losers!

00:23.820 --> 00:29.906
<i>I see the rifles coming over the hill</i>

00:30.035 --> 00:34.697
<i>And if you shout,</i>
<i>maybe they stop and won't kill...</i>

00:35.791 --> 00:38.460
<i>But if they think like me</i>

00:38.585 --> 00:42.120
<i>You'll be as dead as can be</i>

00:55.519 --> 00:56.468
(Click)

01:03.986 --> 01:05.147
Barry Schickel.

01:05.279 --> 01:09.228
Wallet's still with him. With cash. "A" student.

01:09.366 --> 01:11.240
Recently voted class clown.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.154
Strange.

01:16.290 --> 01:19.789
People aren't usually scared of class clowns.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.211
Who said his shooter was scared?

01:24.381 --> 01:25.840
He shot him in the back.

01:25.966 --> 01:29.133
With his zipper down
and hands otherwise engaged.

01:29.261 --> 01:31.253
Yeah.

01:31.388 --> 01:33.215
We're looking for a coward.

02:16.642 --> 02:17.590
Hey! Whoa!

02:17.726 --> 02:21.309
- Whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
- Removing graffiti.

02:21.438 --> 02:24.107
There's been a murder.
Nothing gets cleaned.

02:24.191 --> 02:26.942
School policy. I have to get the graffiti down...

02:27.069 --> 02:29.773
Everything is evidence.
Las Vegas Crime Lab policy.

02:29.905 --> 02:31.280
Shall we call the sheriff?

02:34.701 --> 02:36.409
No.

02:36.536 --> 02:37.947
Thank you.

02:42.626 --> 02:45.081
- I bet you were like that in high school.
- Worse.

02:45.212 --> 02:47.204
You were the girl I ran away from.

02:47.339 --> 02:49.332
Yeah. Till you caught me.

02:49.466 --> 02:51.257
(Laughs)

02:51.385 --> 02:53.543
So football practice was over at 5:45?

02:53.679 --> 02:55.636
- That's right.
- And it was OK

02:55.764 --> 03:00.473
for a student like the victim to return
to the school property to use the rest room?

03:00.602 --> 03:04.267
- Hand me a bindle.
- The place isn't locked up till the janitor leaves,

03:04.398 --> 03:06.604
end of the shift 800830

03:06.733 --> 03:09.937
- Until then the kids use the facilities.
- Brass.

03:10.070 --> 03:12.276
Excuse me! Are we interrupting you?

03:14.658 --> 03:16.900
Yeah. A little.

03:17.035 --> 03:20.238
That's OK. I'll drop by your office.
We'll finish this up.

03:24.918 --> 03:27.290
You found the slug

03:30.382 --> 03:32.375
The treasure hunt paid off, huh?

03:32.509 --> 03:35.593
Yeah, it better.
We have a point of reference.

03:35.721 --> 03:39.006
Well, the nerd squad is off and running.

03:39.141 --> 03:42.925
I'm going to burn a little shoe leather,
see if the vic had a beef with anyone.

03:46.398 --> 03:48.889
Rescue One approaching drop site

03:52.613 --> 03:54.570
We nave a visual Baker One

03:55.741 --> 03:58.410
Stand by for eastern approach

04:04.249 --> 04:06.657
CSI ready for descent

04:07.794 --> 04:09.039
You're good to go!

04:09.171 --> 04:12.504
OK, there he is! Let's get down there!

04:16.261 --> 04:17.209
Ready?

04:17.346 --> 04:18.839
I'll race you!

04:22.684 --> 04:24.511
CSI is in the air

04:27.773 --> 04:29.682
CSI is on the ground

04:31.526 --> 04:34.860
Stokes, Sidle. Crime Lab.

04:34.988 --> 04:36.399
Did you open the bag?

04:36.531 --> 04:38.191
Long enough to see one gnarly hand.

04:38.325 --> 04:40.863
Well, skeleton of a hand.

04:43.789 --> 04:46.659
- Anyone touch the bag since?
- With that smell?

04:46.792 --> 04:48.915
I thought you guys were tougher than that.

04:49.044 --> 04:50.419
Hey, I'm plenty tough.

04:50.545 --> 04:53.215
Down, boy. It was a joke.

04:54.591 --> 04:56.383
Nothing like flirting over a DB!

04:59.012 --> 05:02.179
You want to airlift the body to the coroner's?
We'll radio ahead.

05:02.307 --> 05:04.300
- Sure.
- Wait.

05:07.187 --> 05:12.394
- Are you supposed to do that already?
- Body's coroner's. Property's ours.

05:28.083 --> 05:31.666
We nave the basket Copy that

05:33.714 --> 05:36.039
Rescue One returning to base

05:40.095 --> 05:41.044
Hi.

05:41.179 --> 05:45.925
- Construction on Flamingo. Sorry.
- Give me a hand, will you?

05:49.813 --> 05:52.221
- .38?
- .44.

05:53.442 --> 05:54.722
Here, take this.

05:58.905 --> 06:01.942
- Brass said the victim had a can of spray paint.
- Orange

06:02.075 --> 06:04.151
By my kit. It was in his backpack.

06:11.126 --> 06:14.329
- Did you get something?
- Paint from another source.

06:14.463 --> 06:17.666
I'm going to find out
who belongs to that locker.

06:19.217 --> 06:21.459
Kinda weird, being in a high school, huh?

06:21.595 --> 06:23.587
They do have a timeless quality.

06:23.722 --> 06:25.762
Were you a jock or a brain?

06:25.891 --> 06:27.171
I was a ghost.

06:27.309 --> 06:28.803
There

06:32.230 --> 06:34.022
The shooter was standing right there.

06:48.205 --> 06:49.403
And?

06:49.539 --> 06:52.908
Reconstruction guys can give us
a more precise angle measurement,

06:53.043 --> 06:54.667
but I'm thinking 5' 4"

06:54.795 --> 06:58.377
Maybe 3". We got ourselves a shortie.

06:59.508 --> 07:02.295
Let's see what metal shows up.

07:04.471 --> 07:06.677
There's no gun on our dead body.

07:06.807 --> 07:10.057
Wouldn't it be easier to unzip the bag
and see what shape our vic is in?

07:10.185 --> 07:13.020
I like to put that off till the last moment
with you cops.

07:16.358 --> 07:17.686
I see a coin

07:17.818 --> 07:20.569
- Looks like a half-dollar.
- Silver Whole

07:20.696 --> 07:22.154
I've done a few of these.

07:24.032 --> 07:25.692
What's that?

07:25.826 --> 07:28.068
There. About four inches long. What is that?

07:28.203 --> 07:30.990
That looks like a pin. That's a medical implant.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.743
And that's a plate in the skull.

07:35.877 --> 07:37.751
Head's been rolled

07:37.879 --> 07:39.587
I'd say we're dealing with a male.

07:39.715 --> 07:42.087
By the sound of it,
he's been dead about two months.

07:42.217 --> 07:43.332
Sound?

07:43.468 --> 07:46.672
(Sloshing)
- You weren't here when ESD brought this in.

07:46.805 --> 07:49.759
Oh, it wasn't from lack of trying.

07:52.394 --> 07:56.439
Let's go to the VIP room.
I'll show you what I mean.

08:00.902 --> 08:02.895
That's Dennis Fram's locker.

08:03.030 --> 08:06.399
Has the deceased
spray-painted his locker before?

08:06.533 --> 08:09.736
I'm the school counsellor.
I don't know every move these kids make.

08:09.870 --> 08:12.705
Well, that's obvious,
or a young man wouldn't be dead.

08:14.541 --> 08:17.577
Tell me what "stick" means.

08:22.591 --> 08:24.548
Is that a polymer sensor proboscis?

08:25.719 --> 08:27.712
Cyranose 320.

08:27.846 --> 08:29.839
Company sent it to me gratis for a week.

08:29.973 --> 08:32.890
They figure, if it helps, CSI will buy one.

08:33.018 --> 08:34.927
Electronic noses run like ten grand.

08:35.062 --> 08:38.846
Yeah, well, what if the shooter
chooses a certain kind of tobacco,

08:38.982 --> 08:42.316
or has a unique halitosis
and the e-nose picks up on it?

08:42.443 --> 08:44.567
If that thing bit the shooter in the ass,

08:44.696 --> 08:47.863
the county would not approve
a $10,000 purchase order.

08:49.284 --> 08:52.736
I thought it was our job to speak for the victim

08:52.871 --> 08:55.789
no matter what it took,
and to hell with the budgets.

08:55.916 --> 08:58.323
Our job is to think, Warrick.

08:58.460 --> 09:00.916
Machinery should never matter
more than our mind.

09:02.923 --> 09:04.085
Try this.

09:06.635 --> 09:08.627
Glass tube.

09:09.763 --> 09:12.799
- Air pump.
- Air pump. Costs about ten buck s.

09:14.476 --> 09:15.639
Absorption agent?

09:15.769 --> 09:17.643
Fresh out.

09:17.771 --> 09:19.265
Improvise.

09:23.986 --> 09:27.355
And Miss Barrett says
that a Dennis Fram had been bullied

09:27.489 --> 09:28.983
by the deceased all year.

09:29.116 --> 09:33.659
He spray-painted his locker. Always
something to do with his build - skinny, shortie.

09:33.787 --> 09:37.286
- That kind of thing.
- Dennis is slight and Barry always picks on him.

09:37.416 --> 09:42.161
- Can you arrange for us to meet with Dennis?
- Of course, but he would never hurt Barry.

09:42.296 --> 09:45.878
He's a good kid. He's totally non-violent.

09:46.008 --> 09:47.668
Well, then, this'll be brief.

09:48.969 --> 09:50.511
(Sighs)

09:50.637 --> 09:52.796
We can call him from my office.

09:54.516 --> 09:56.176
You coming?

09:56.310 --> 09:58.302
Oh, I'll catch up to you.

10:02.941 --> 10:03.890
Hey!

10:04.026 --> 10:07.858
- I need to talk to you
- I didn't clean anything.

10:07.988 --> 10:09.103
It's not about that.

10:10.282 --> 10:12.274
How tall are you, Dennis?

10:14.786 --> 10:16.909
Five three and one quarter.

10:18.874 --> 10:21.080
Have you washed your hands in the last hour?

10:21.209 --> 10:22.869
Yeah. Why?

10:23.003 --> 10:24.663
Changed your shirt?

10:24.796 --> 10:28.497
- No.
- I'd like to do a test on your shirt, if I may.

10:28.634 --> 10:30.342
What kind of test?

10:30.469 --> 10:31.927
Forensic.

10:52.491 --> 10:54.234
What is that?

10:54.368 --> 10:56.076
GSR

10:56.203 --> 10:59.702
When someone fires a weapon,
gunshot residue plumes back

10:59.831 --> 11:01.539
onto their hands and clothing

11:05.629 --> 11:09.413
This means that you fired a gun
within the last three to six hours.

11:09.549 --> 11:12.467
- Dennis!
- The police are gonna want to talk to you.

11:15.722 --> 11:17.632
So you admit you fired a gun

11:17.766 --> 11:20.174
I was over at the shooting range on Desert Way.

11:20.310 --> 11:24.688
The same night Barry Schickel was shot,
you were out taking target practice?

11:24.815 --> 11:27.103
I go every Monday night. Ask my sister.

11:27.234 --> 11:29.310
- She goes with me
- Where's your gun?

11:29.444 --> 11:32.694
- I rent different ones there.
- Did you ever rent a.44 calibre?

11:32.823 --> 11:35.859
I'm sorry I nave to keep people out
- Sometimes.

11:35.993 --> 11:38.863
I want to see my brother. Get out of the way!

11:39.955 --> 11:42.909
- Denny, are you OK? I got your call.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:43.041 --> 11:45.081
We're conducting a police investigation.

11:45.210 --> 11:48.959
My dad's back in town tonight.
You'll be sorry you harassed my little brother.

11:49.089 --> 11:52.505
Questioned. A student was shot and killed
in this building tonight.

11:53.594 --> 11:55.088
You know what?

11:55.220 --> 11:58.257
Dennis has explained to you
about the gunpowder

11:58.390 --> 12:02.091
and his sister will vouch for his whereabouts
And he's a minor

12:02.227 --> 12:03.176
Jim.

12:04.354 --> 12:06.098
We'll be in touch

12:11.028 --> 12:13.732
Remember, breathe through your mouth.

12:18.744 --> 12:19.942
Eurgh!

12:29.338 --> 12:32.457
Metal plate.

12:36.261 --> 12:39.013
Silver dollar.

12:43.894 --> 12:45.721
Gambling chip.

12:47.648 --> 12:48.596
And...

12:53.028 --> 12:54.606
Jacket.

12:54.738 --> 12:58.189
- Government issue, army.
- (Sara gasps)

12:58.325 --> 12:59.985
Pile of bones, and that's it.

13:00.118 --> 13:03.238
That's it? No... organs?

13:03.372 --> 13:05.032
No tonsils? No

13:06.959 --> 13:07.907
Soup...

13:09.086 --> 13:10.912
Human soup.

13:11.046 --> 13:14.794
Well, we are T3.5% liquid, eh, Dave?

13:14.925 --> 13:18.341
Add some bacteria, a couple of gases, and voilá!

13:18.470 --> 13:22.053
OK, I'll take Liquid Man's jacket.
See what I can find.

13:22.182 --> 13:23.261
I'll cremate this.

13:23.392 --> 13:26.061
What if we find the family or they find us?

13:26.144 --> 13:28.896
A bad decomp
can stink up the entire building for ever.

13:29.022 --> 13:32.059
The sooner we dispose of this, the better.

13:32.192 --> 13:34.268
Not for our investigation.

13:36.154 --> 13:38.990
(Gasps)

13:39.116 --> 13:42.900
Let me guess. Decomp in an enclosed space.

13:43.036 --> 13:44.945
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the zip bag.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.788
Lemons.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.994
- Lemons?
- What?

13:51.169 --> 13:52.877
Use lemons.

14:04.141 --> 14:06.133
<i>BLIND FAITH: Can't Find My Way Home</i>

14:25.078 --> 14:30.239
<i>But I can't find my way home</i>

14:30.375 --> 14:35.084
<i>Still I can't find my way home</i>

14:35.505 --> 14:40.926
<i>And I ain't done nothing wrong, no-oo</i>

14:41.053 --> 14:45.264
<i>But I can't find my way home</i>

14:53.523 --> 14:55.849
How's your new toy working out?

14:55.984 --> 14:58.226
It's been downsized.

14:58.362 --> 15:01.113
Bummer. I know how you wanted
to see that thing work.

15:02.366 --> 15:05.201
Well, it's the same difference, really.

15:06.662 --> 15:08.654
Air is drawn into the glass tube.

15:08.789 --> 15:11.576
Chalk absorbs the chemicals from the air.

15:14.002 --> 15:16.672
And mass spec will break it down at the lab.

15:18.340 --> 15:21.839
So why did you need the expensive one
in the first place?

15:21.969 --> 15:23.961
Cos it was cool.

15:25.931 --> 15:28.173
- I'll see you in homeroom.
- All right.

15:28.308 --> 15:30.135
Barry Schickel from the high school.

15:30.269 --> 15:33.969
Dug three of these.44s from his back.

15:34.106 --> 15:37.973
First one cracked his infraspinous fossa.

15:38.402 --> 15:42.565
Second one entered past the interior angle
of the scapula, punctured a lung.

15:42.864 --> 15:47.111
And the last one entered
just right of the right anterior serratus muscle,

15:47.244 --> 15:48.193
pierced the heart.

15:48.328 --> 15:50.784
The heart? That makes no sense.

15:50.914 --> 15:53.203
This is a special case.

15:55.002 --> 15:56.994
See the scar?

15:57.129 --> 15:58.920
This guy was attacked before.

15:59.047 --> 16:02.381
I'd say in the last six months.

16:02.509 --> 16:04.798
Well, not with a knife. It looks like prongs.

16:04.928 --> 16:08.629
Whatever it was, it would have killed him
if his heart had been there.

16:11.476 --> 16:13.019
Where was his heart?

16:13.145 --> 16:14.853
Barry's upper body,

16:14.980 --> 16:20.223
all his internal organs
are on the opposite side of typical placement.

16:21.987 --> 16:24.857
Dextrocardia? Like Dr No?

16:24.990 --> 16:28.857
That only presents in, what,
.01% of the population?

16:28.994 --> 16:31.033
Good for this guy, till his luck ran out.

16:36.418 --> 16:38.826
How long ago did you say he was stabbed?

16:38.962 --> 16:43.292
Six months. Hand-to-hand combat.
Sound like something your suspect would do?

16:45.761 --> 16:46.710
No.

16:58.315 --> 17:00.308
(Exhales)

17:04.905 --> 17:07.028
Hey, how's Liquid Man doing?

17:07.156 --> 17:09.150
You mean Mr Cartsen?

17:10.410 --> 17:14.159
I found this. It's a name tag.

17:14.289 --> 17:18.416
You know, Sara, a lot of homeless guys
get these army jackets.

17:18.542 --> 17:21.080
Cheap. Salvage stores.

17:21.213 --> 17:25.079
Well, it's a start.
I'm gonna get Homicide to check

17:25.217 --> 17:28.337
the VA medical database for a W Cartsen
with plates or pins.

17:28.470 --> 17:29.633
OK.

17:35.435 --> 17:36.384
Eurgh!

17:40.315 --> 17:42.272
What have you got?

17:42.401 --> 17:46.398
I don't know.
Can't read an address or a phone number.

17:46.530 --> 17:47.810
God it reeks!

17:47.948 --> 17:49.940
QD should be able to...

17:50.075 --> 17:52.317
to bring something up.

17:52.452 --> 17:54.492
(Vomits)

17:59.084 --> 18:00.247
Don't tell anyone.

18:00.377 --> 18:01.705
About what?

18:04.756 --> 18:06.464
Sara?

18:07.634 --> 18:09.426
Hi.

18:09.553 --> 18:12.969
They told me out front I could find you... here.

18:13.098 --> 18:14.723
Yeah.

18:14.850 --> 18:17.804
Um... I'll be right out.

18:20.397 --> 18:22.935
- Give me a mint.
- You're gonna need more than one.

18:23.066 --> 18:23.848
Just gimme.

18:29.698 --> 18:33.446
- This is a nice surprise.
- I wanted to see if you'd like to have dinner.

18:33.577 --> 18:36.697
Yeah. Um... when?

18:36.830 --> 18:38.490
Now. I'm on break.

18:38.624 --> 18:42.491
I'm in the middle of that DB from the gully.
He's still a John Doe.

18:42.628 --> 18:45.165
We don't know the circumstances...

18:45.297 --> 18:46.791
I smell.

18:46.924 --> 18:47.955
No.

18:48.091 --> 18:50.001
Well, not that bad.

18:50.135 --> 18:53.718
I'd change clothes,
but the problem is that it's human fat reduced

18:53.847 --> 18:57.430
and it's attached itself
to my follicles and my pores, so...

18:59.436 --> 19:01.393
- You don't look good.
- I need some air.

19:01.521 --> 19:04.059
- OK.
- Er, no, you stay.

19:04.191 --> 19:08.402
You've got that John Doe to worry about,
and I can always stop by another time.

19:08.528 --> 19:09.643
Right.

19:10.822 --> 19:11.771
OK.

19:11.907 --> 19:12.856
Bye.

19:18.914 --> 19:21.583
- You smell like death.
- I've heard.

19:22.918 --> 19:25.076
You know, a real man wouldn't mind.

19:34.137 --> 19:38.052
- Have you talked to Barry's parents?
- I did. They had no idea he'd been stabbed.

19:38.183 --> 19:41.433
The older kids get,
the less they talk to their parents.

19:41.561 --> 19:43.554
They talk to you, though, right?

19:43.689 --> 19:47.188
Who else may have had it in for Barry Schickel?

19:47.317 --> 19:50.733
Look, he was very popular, but he was a bully.

19:50.862 --> 19:54.362
So there was probably a dozen kids
who wanted to see him dead.

19:55.534 --> 19:56.483
Really?

19:56.618 --> 20:00.283
I'd be walking by and... he would punch me.

20:02.916 --> 20:05.205
Everybody started calling me Flinch.

20:06.336 --> 20:07.534
Even the teachers.

20:07.921 --> 20:09.499
Move!

20:09.631 --> 20:11.873
He was the meanest guy I've ever known.

20:12.009 --> 20:15.045
But the way he put you down, it sounded funny.

20:16.221 --> 20:17.170
If it wasn't you.

20:17.306 --> 20:20.010
He'd wait for me, every day.

20:20.142 --> 20:22.549
Lunchtime, fourth period.

20:22.686 --> 20:23.635
Take my food.

20:23.770 --> 20:25.514
Yo. Hungry?

20:25.647 --> 20:27.023
Till I fixed him.

20:28.775 --> 20:30.851
It was about... half a year ago.

20:30.986 --> 20:33.441
- I went at him.
With a fork?

20:33.572 --> 20:35.944
Stabbed him above his left pectoral.

20:36.074 --> 20:42.444
Yeah. It still didn't stop him. I mean,
today was the first day I could come to school

20:42.581 --> 20:44.455
and not feel like a moving target.

20:44.583 --> 20:47.288
Where were you last night about six o'clock?

20:47.419 --> 20:50.088
When Barry was shot?

20:53.926 --> 20:55.384
Boxing practice.

20:56.762 --> 20:57.876
OK.

20:59.056 --> 21:00.004
Thanks.

21:03.936 --> 21:05.311
I can protect them

21:05.437 --> 21:08.473
from being called
a derogatory word for homosexual,

21:08.607 --> 21:10.564
or the N-word.

21:10.692 --> 21:13.148
Everything else falls under free speech.

21:13.278 --> 21:15.318
No-one's blaming you.

21:17.032 --> 21:17.981
I am.

21:18.116 --> 21:21.117
You know who did this, don't you?

21:23.705 --> 21:25.912
You have no idea what these kids go through.

21:26.041 --> 21:29.327
I listen to them every day.

21:29.461 --> 21:31.786
Divorce. Working parents.

21:31.922 --> 21:33.831
Cliques.

21:33.966 --> 21:37.381
And all they need is just one person
to believe in them.

21:40.138 --> 21:41.882
Yeah.

21:42.015 --> 21:44.008
But where does that leave Barry Schickel?

21:44.142 --> 21:46.812
That's your job.

21:52.651 --> 21:54.644
Shut up. She was not?

21:54.778 --> 21:56.320
I saw her in action.

21:56.446 --> 21:58.439
- Really?
- Yeah. She was...

21:58.573 --> 21:59.688
Catherine?!

21:59.825 --> 22:02.031
I was what?

22:02.160 --> 22:06.288
I was just telling Nick how you were a big bully
in high school.

22:06.415 --> 22:07.494
Oh, bully?

22:07.624 --> 22:12.333
All right, I guess I was. But not the kind
that people want to take a gun out and shoot.

22:12.462 --> 22:14.122
- No.
No, no.

22:14.256 --> 22:17.459
You were the kind
guys fall all over themselves trying to impress.

22:17.593 --> 22:18.791
Like you, Nick, huh?

22:22.598 --> 22:24.756
Oh, Nick, what were you in high school?

22:24.891 --> 22:26.884
Me? I was er...

22:28.145 --> 22:29.639
I was dependable.

22:29.771 --> 22:32.642
Dependable? Dependable jock?

22:32.774 --> 22:34.933
Dependable stoner?

22:35.068 --> 22:39.113
No, never a strap, never a smoker.
Just all-around dependable guy, I guess.

22:39.239 --> 22:41.315
He's trying to say he was unpopular.

22:41.450 --> 22:43.608
I was popular with the right people,

22:43.744 --> 22:44.942
I can tell you that.

22:45.078 --> 22:48.115
I can also tell you what I wasn't.
I wasn't a Mac Daddy wannabe

22:48.248 --> 22:51.498
with a Members Only jacket,
putting the swerve on all the ladies.

22:51.627 --> 22:53.952
Members Only jackets were cool
back in the day.

22:54.087 --> 22:55.498
Hey

22:55.631 --> 22:58.038
Ronnie's got something on Liquid Man.
Says it's hot.

22:58.175 --> 22:59.717
Good.

23:00.969 --> 23:03.211
Hey, Sara, what were you in high school?

23:03.347 --> 23:05.304
Science nerd.

23:05.432 --> 23:07.472
(Sniffs) Are you changed?

23:07.601 --> 23:09.225
(Whispers) You still smell.

23:10.354 --> 23:11.302
Let's go!

23:11.438 --> 23:14.807
So that leaves you, Warrick. What were you?

23:14.942 --> 23:19.520
Oh, I was short. I had big feet, thick glasses.

23:19.655 --> 23:21.647
- You?
- Yeah!

23:21.782 --> 23:26.194
I got pushed around by all the guys
and never got any play from the girls.

23:26.328 --> 23:28.819
The girls didn't even notice your eyes.

23:28.956 --> 23:29.904
No.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.531
They used to tease me about my eyes,
call me names.

23:32.668 --> 23:36.202
Oh. Well, what do they know?

23:36.338 --> 23:37.583
They're your best feature.

23:37.714 --> 23:39.873
I didn't have a best feature in high school.

23:41.718 --> 23:45.846
Looking back on it now, I could say I could see
both sides of it, thinking about this guy,

23:45.973 --> 23:48.890
Barry Schickel, and how he was shot

23:49.017 --> 23:51.140
and whichever kid did it.

23:51.270 --> 23:53.309
I'm not saying it was right,

23:53.438 --> 23:55.514
but I kinda understand, you know?

23:56.650 --> 23:57.599
Yeah.

24:06.076 --> 24:09.659
I wanted to hold off on this matchbook
until it dried out,

24:09.788 --> 24:10.784
and then realised...

24:10.914 --> 24:13.488
Human fat never dries out. Just gets waxy.

24:13.625 --> 24:14.704
Exactly

24:14.835 --> 24:19.710
What I'm doing is adding pixels at some points...

24:21.091 --> 24:23.962
...and erasing pixels at other points.

24:42.237 --> 24:45.404
- Got it.
- Roma...

24:47.534 --> 24:50.737
- Romanini's. Never heard of it.
I have.

24:50.871 --> 24:53.658
Nightclub for boomers off the Strip.
Thanks, man.

24:56.543 --> 24:58.417
Hey Stokes!

24:58.545 --> 25:00.205
Your W Cartsen -

25:00.339 --> 25:03.505
he's a Second Lieutenant William Cartsen.

25:03.634 --> 25:05.922
Served in the war, wounded in action.

25:06.053 --> 25:08.626
Got sent stateside
after they put him back together.

25:08.764 --> 25:10.424
They put a pin in his spine

25:10.557 --> 25:12.929
and a plate in his head 31 years ago.

25:13.060 --> 25:16.345
Walked out of the hospital,
hasn't been heard of since.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.855
Come with us?

26:06.363 --> 26:10.230
- What's the matter? You don't trust me?
- I trust you.

26:18.125 --> 26:20.663
I got a boatload of chemical components here.

26:20.794 --> 26:22.787
Marijuana, bubble gum,

26:23.922 --> 26:25.001
cigars.

26:25.132 --> 26:28.999
- It's like every guy's bathroom in America
- What doesn't belong?

26:38.312 --> 26:40.767
How can I help you people?

26:40.897 --> 26:43.223
Valet guy said you were the manager.

26:43.358 --> 26:45.398
Detective O'Riley, Las Vegas PD.

26:45.527 --> 26:48.065
- Stokes and Sidle from the Crime Lab
- Crime Lab?

26:48.196 --> 26:49.940
What's going on?

26:50.073 --> 26:53.692
This man a patron of your establishment?
Name's William Cartsen.

26:53.827 --> 26:56.116
Not that I recognise, no.

26:56.246 --> 26:58.784
Are you sure you haven't seen him
around here?

26:58.915 --> 27:01.407
Wore an army jacket.
May have been down on his luck.

27:01.543 --> 27:04.034
Oh, you mean Moses.

27:04.171 --> 27:07.456
- Moses.
- That guy had a beard down to here,

27:07.591 --> 27:09.749
wore a robe, the army jacket.

27:09.885 --> 27:12.886
Stood out here scaring every patron I had.

27:13.013 --> 27:14.804
Hey!

27:14.932 --> 27:18.051
The whole world is watching!
Speak out! Speak out!

27:18.185 --> 27:21.055
- The guy was ruining my business!
- So what did you do?

27:21.188 --> 27:23.264
Tried to reason with him.

27:24.983 --> 27:26.477
Hey buddy

27:26.610 --> 27:29.279
You got to leave my customers alone, OK?

27:30.405 --> 27:31.734
Here.

27:31.865 --> 27:33.407
Cash that.

27:33.533 --> 27:35.822
And move on

27:35.953 --> 27:38.657
- That's the last I saw of him.
- When was that?

27:38.789 --> 27:40.912
I don't know. About two months ago.

27:41.041 --> 27:45.252
That's funny. We found his body.
Coroner says he's been dead two months.

27:46.380 --> 27:49.049
We're gonna want you
to take a little ride with us.

27:50.467 --> 27:51.416
OK.

28:04.314 --> 28:06.307
I checked out those kids you talked to.

28:06.441 --> 28:10.771
None of them was even near the school
when Barry Schickel was killed.

28:10.904 --> 28:14.605
- The one who doesn't check out is Dennis.
There's a reason

28:14.741 --> 28:17.446
I can put him at the crime scene.
Can you call from the car?

28:17.577 --> 28:19.950
- Sure. Let's go.
- Put him there how?

28:20.080 --> 28:22.653
- Well, I'll explain on the way.
- No no

28:22.791 --> 28:25.033
I'll stay here, with this, close to Warrick.

28:25.168 --> 28:28.288
OK. Bet you miss all the firework s.

28:35.637 --> 28:38.722
I know I must sound like the typical parent,

28:38.849 --> 28:41.518
but my son had nothing to do with this death.

28:41.602 --> 28:43.559
We placed him at the murder.

28:43.687 --> 28:44.683
What?

28:44.813 --> 28:48.478
Here's a fingerprint
that I recovered from Dennis's locker.

28:48.609 --> 28:52.227
These are Dennis's prints on file at school.

28:52.362 --> 28:55.980
The missing kids prevention drive

28:56.116 --> 28:57.990
Has a match.

28:58.118 --> 29:01.534
His own fingerprint on his own locker
doesn't prove anything.

29:01.663 --> 29:03.407
It proves a timeline.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.367
The alkyd particles

29:05.500 --> 29:10.162
in the victim's spray paint
adhere and dry in 30 seconds.

29:12.132 --> 29:17.008
Oxidation Dennis had to nave swiped
the paint within seconds

29:17.137 --> 29:20.506
of Barry putting it on his locker
for his print to take.

29:20.641 --> 29:22.929
- How do you know...?
- The janitor

29:23.060 --> 29:26.559
He keeps timed records of graffiti.

29:26.688 --> 29:27.767
Job security.

29:27.898 --> 29:32.394
And Dennis left paint on the doorjamb
in the bathroom where Barry was shot.

29:34.363 --> 29:37.566
That's the timeline
of the murder Mr Fram

29:37.699 --> 29:42.242
We know every move your son made up
until the gun, so we want to see your collection.

29:42.371 --> 29:45.704
- You're registered as having 24 weapons
Denny

29:45.832 --> 29:48.370
It's OK. It's OK.

29:48.502 --> 29:49.782
Come on.

29:51.922 --> 29:52.871
We'll fix it.

29:58.345 --> 29:59.376
This...

30:00.931 --> 30:02.970
...does not belong in a guy's bathroom.

30:04.434 --> 30:06.925
Can we prove this?
There's got to be 1,000 brands.

30:07.062 --> 30:10.063
You still got that $10,000 e-nose
you were using?

30:10.190 --> 30:12.728
Now you want my tricked-out toy?

30:12.859 --> 30:14.899
I just want the software.

30:21.034 --> 30:21.983
Come on, drink up.

30:22.119 --> 30:24.111
There you go. Good.

30:28.375 --> 30:31.910
Just hold this to your face, OK?
I'll be right back.

30:35.465 --> 30:39.463
He's got a bleeding ulcer
from being bullied by Barry Schickel.

30:43.974 --> 30:45.801
Hey, Shrimp, wanna go for a ride?

30:47.894 --> 30:49.971
You don't know now nard it was for him

30:50.105 --> 30:52.678
Trying to work up the courage
just to go to school.

30:52.816 --> 30:55.770
(Vomiting)

31:00.073 --> 31:02.991
I thought my little brother
was gonna kill himself.

31:03.118 --> 31:04.992
Then someone killed Barry.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.201
Yeah.

31:08.332 --> 31:10.704
How tall are you?

31:10.834 --> 31:14.250
5' 4". With heels.

31:16.423 --> 31:17.621
Why?

31:17.758 --> 31:19.667
No reason.

31:20.802 --> 31:22.961
You grabbed a top note of floral

31:23.096 --> 31:26.133
Now we ask the software
to break it into ingredients

31:26.266 --> 31:28.140
You recognise any of these?

31:28.268 --> 31:30.142
That's all from one perfume?

31:30.270 --> 31:33.437
Some of these perfumes
have, like, T50 ingredients.

31:37.361 --> 31:38.985
Chanteuse.

31:40.614 --> 31:42.690
We can narrow it down to one brand?

31:42.824 --> 31:46.158
The original application for this program
was perfume companies.

31:46.286 --> 31:50.118
You know, testing new brands,
stealing from the competition.

31:50.248 --> 31:51.743
(Cellphone rings)

31:51.875 --> 31:53.500
Grissom.

31:53.627 --> 31:57.078
Grissom, we got a suspect,
but it's not who you think.

31:57.214 --> 32:00.334
Let me guess. Denny Fram's sister?

32:00.467 --> 32:03.421
- How did you know?
- Vapour molecules

32:03.553 --> 32:06.922
See if you can get a warrant for her perfume
and have Brass bring her in.

32:07.057 --> 32:08.516
Her perfume?

32:08.642 --> 32:11.394
Let's get back to my first question, Miss Fram.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.892
Where were you
the night Barry Schickel was killed?

32:14.022 --> 32:17.854
I told you. I was out, driving around.

32:17.985 --> 32:22.029
So what, your perfume
just wafted into the boys' room

32:22.155 --> 32:26.402
- all the way from Highway 10?
- Yes. I wear Chanteuse.

32:26.535 --> 32:30.283
What's that got to do with anything?
My mom used to wear it.

32:30.414 --> 32:37.412
- And... after her car accident I started to wear it.
Well aromas nave fingerprints

32:37.546 --> 32:41.330
They're like a unique combination
of vapour molecules that linger in the air

32:41.466 --> 32:43.210
long after the source has gone.

32:43.343 --> 32:48.717
We isolated a combination in the rest room
where Barry Schickel was shot.

32:48.849 --> 32:50.391
It matches your perfume.

32:50.517 --> 32:52.842
A high-end woman's perfume.

32:52.978 --> 32:55.895
It's doubtful
that any other girl at the school wears it.

32:56.023 --> 32:58.977
Wait, wait, wait. She has no reason
to hurt Barry Schickel.

32:59.109 --> 33:01.398
What about revenge for her little brother?

33:01.528 --> 33:05.905
I can't believe this!
That bastard Schickel dogged my family.

33:06.033 --> 33:08.156
Now he's doing it from the grave!

33:08.285 --> 33:09.909
Come on, Kelsey.

33:11.038 --> 33:13.908
You come near us again,
you do it through my lawyer.

33:19.546 --> 33:22.037
Wears her dead mother's perfume.

33:24.259 --> 33:26.584
- Nice touch.
Might be true

33:26.720 --> 33:29.472
Scent triggers memory
most acutely of all the senses.

33:29.598 --> 33:30.547
Yeah?

33:32.559 --> 33:36.094
Well, I smell a rat in the Fram family.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.235
So, you didn't hurt him.
You just put him in your car.

33:43.362 --> 33:45.438
Back seat. And I drove him out of town.

33:45.572 --> 33:49.652
- I left him on the roadside out by Red Rock.
- You didn't maybe...

33:49.785 --> 33:52.786
zip him up in a bag
because he was giving you trouble?

33:52.913 --> 33:54.905
Anything like that?

33:55.040 --> 33:56.320
No.

33:57.918 --> 34:02.912
These are the handles from the bag
that he was found in.

34:04.091 --> 34:06.795
You see these prints here?

34:10.138 --> 34:12.012
Can I see your right hand, sir?

34:12.139 --> 34:16.054
Look, he was drunk.
He was rolling all over my back seat.

34:16.186 --> 34:18.511
So I put him in a bag from my trunk

34:18.647 --> 34:22.230
Once we got out of town,
I just tipped him down a hill.

34:27.489 --> 34:29.731
I figured he'd get out once he slept it off.

34:30.909 --> 34:32.701
The guy always shows up!

34:33.829 --> 34:35.987
What am I looking at?

34:37.581 --> 34:38.781
Homicide.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.659
Look, I was just doing my job.

34:42.795 --> 34:48.217
Hey, treating another human being
like garbage is not a job.

34:49.344 --> 34:50.719
It's a choice.

34:58.312 --> 34:59.260
Paperwork. Later.

34:59.396 --> 35:00.641
Dennis?

35:02.816 --> 35:04.358
I need to talk to you.

35:06.111 --> 35:10.191
You have to understand.
Anything my sister did was to protect me.

35:10.324 --> 35:13.823
You said that you went back to school that night
after target practice.

35:13.952 --> 35:17.072
I forgot a book I needed for homework.

35:17.205 --> 35:19.198
And I knew Barry had been there.

35:22.669 --> 35:25.872
I wasn't looking for him.
I had to go to the bathroom.

35:40.145 --> 35:42.303
My dad's freaking out.

35:42.439 --> 35:44.479
My sister won't come out of her room.

35:45.609 --> 35:49.654
I figured... if you can get the police
to make some kind of deal for her...

35:50.822 --> 35:52.780
Well, Dennis, you haven't told us

35:52.908 --> 35:55.992
that you explicitly
saw Kelsey shoot the victim.

35:56.119 --> 35:58.242
She was in a stall. I couldn't see her.

36:00.123 --> 36:03.077
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Excuse us.

36:09.091 --> 36:10.549
He copping to anything?

36:10.676 --> 36:14.720
- He says that his sister did it.
- I don't think so.

36:14.846 --> 36:18.215
Kelsey was otherwise disposed.

36:18.350 --> 36:21.719
She got a parking ticket
the same time the vic was shot.

36:21.853 --> 36:24.391
In an alley behind a motel off Fremont Street.

36:24.523 --> 36:28.651
In fact, a lot of cars got tickets that night.

36:31.405 --> 36:33.397
Who's Jeremy Spencer?

36:33.532 --> 36:35.275
Football coach.

36:35.409 --> 36:36.903
Oh.

36:37.035 --> 36:39.277
At a motel with the high school coach.

36:39.413 --> 36:41.785
No wonder she wouldn't talk.

36:41.915 --> 36:45.201
I paid Coach a visit.
The guy's 23, just got engaged.

36:45.335 --> 36:48.005
He'll testify
as long as his fiancée doesn't find out.

36:48.130 --> 36:53.504
He says that Kelsey gave him a roll in the hay,
asked him to intercede with Barry the bully

36:53.635 --> 36:55.924
and get the kid to leave her brother alone

36:57.180 --> 36:58.556
She didn't kill anyone.

36:58.682 --> 37:01.090
So why is he saying she did?

37:01.226 --> 37:04.595
Ever smell a fart
and end up blaming the wrong guy?

37:09.401 --> 37:11.394
Why do you think your sister shot Barry?

37:12.529 --> 37:13.810
Because.

37:13.947 --> 37:16.023
Because why?

37:17.326 --> 37:19.651
Because of the last time he beat me up.

37:25.417 --> 37:30.209
I'll protect you.
I'll fix things so he never comes near you again.

37:30.339 --> 37:32.664
She always keeps her word.

37:32.799 --> 37:36.382
She asked Barry's coach to help you.
That was her protection plan.

37:36.511 --> 37:38.504
She was nowhere near the high school

37:38.639 --> 37:40.382
I smelled her perfume.

37:40.515 --> 37:42.389
I saw Barry

37:42.517 --> 37:45.435
I saw the gun
And I smelled my sister's perfume

37:48.023 --> 37:50.016
No.

37:50.150 --> 37:52.522
You smelled her brand of perfume.

37:52.653 --> 37:55.025
Then who was it?

38:01.620 --> 38:04.870
We recovered this
from your townhouse on a warrant.

38:04.998 --> 38:07.869
Chanteuse.

38:11.713 --> 38:13.338
We also found the gun.

38:18.136 --> 38:19.963
It hasn't been cleaned.

38:22.474 --> 38:27.053
Well, I don't know how to clean a gun.
That was my husband's.

38:27.187 --> 38:29.678
You know how to shoot one, though.

38:29.815 --> 38:33.184
Do you know how many kids
go to school and kill,

38:33.318 --> 38:35.856
just to get relief from the bullying?

38:35.988 --> 38:40.199
You talk to them
Boxing lessons and target practice

38:40.325 --> 38:45.912
How long before one of them came in here
and opened fire on a hallway full of kids?

38:49.001 --> 38:53.045
I just thought that one life was better than 20.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.834
Or 30.

38:56.967 --> 38:57.916
Or 11.

39:03.765 --> 39:04.845
Captain Brass

39:04.975 --> 39:06.517
ran a search on you.

39:09.438 --> 39:11.810
Tetrick High School, Tetrick, Arizona.

39:11.940 --> 39:14.147
11 kids snot a few days after Columbine

39:15.319 --> 39:17.477
You were the assistant principal.

39:21.491 --> 39:22.950
I watched them die...

39:24.077 --> 39:25.785
...at my feet.

39:27.831 --> 39:32.078
Just because some sophomore
couldn't take the jokes about his glasses.

39:36.340 --> 39:40.289
It says that you were left
with post-traumatic stress disorder.

39:40.427 --> 39:42.633
You might want to mention that to your lawyer.

39:44.181 --> 39:47.466
I did this for my kids.

39:47.601 --> 39:49.593
You know, Miss Barrett,

39:51.688 --> 39:54.179
as difficult as high school can be for kids,

39:55.317 --> 39:56.811
eventually it's over.

39:58.904 --> 40:01.573
But too soon for Barry Schickel.

40:19.549 --> 40:21.507
(Bell)

41:19.026 --> 41:21.351
Rest in peace, Lieutenant.

41:22.404 --> 41:24.112
Rest in peace.
