WEBVTT

00:07.920 --> 00:09.313
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:09.313 --> 00:10.749
Thank you for coming.

00:10.749 --> 00:13.665
It has truly been my honor
to have the opportunity

00:13.665 --> 00:16.886
to show Mr. Dwayne Johnson
our beautiful country.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.279
Dwayne, if you would.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.541
Yes, thank you,
Prime Minister.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.585
Hello, everybody.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.413
So we just returned
from touring

00:22.413 --> 00:24.807
your National Education Center.

00:24.807 --> 00:27.766
And I've got to tell you guys,
I was completely blown away

00:27.766 --> 00:31.901
by Gjelgjiughm commitment
to your most valuable resource,

00:31.901 --> 00:32.902
the coffee.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.123
No, I'm only kidding.
Of course it's the kids.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.385
The children.

00:37.385 --> 00:40.301
There's that famous
Dwayne Johnson humor,

00:40.301 --> 00:42.346
which we always enjoy
in all of his movies,

00:42.346 --> 00:44.044
except maybe "Huskies."

00:44.044 --> 00:45.697
If we continue--

00:45.697 --> 00:48.091
Prime Minister, what do you
say to the Gjelgjiughms

00:48.091 --> 00:50.615
who are upset by your refusal
to rename Cannibal's Peak,

00:50.615 --> 00:52.835
"Billy Will You Go To The Dance
With Me It's Maria" Mountain?

00:52.835 --> 00:56.056
I hear their frustration
and take it to heart.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.144
Next question, please.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.493
By ignoring the vote,

00:58.493 --> 01:00.103
are you concerned
you look out of touch?

01:00.103 --> 01:01.887
As a leader,
sometimes we have to make

01:01.887 --> 01:06.240
a tough decision, even if it
is the unpopular choice.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.024
What did she just say?

01:08.024 --> 01:10.244
- Prime Minister, if I may?
- Please do.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.810
Thank you.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.378
You know, guys, during my
short stay here in Gjelgjiughm,

01:14.378 --> 01:17.816
I've really come to admire
the people's passion

01:17.816 --> 01:19.862
for standing up
for what they believe in.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.951
And if I could share
a quick story with you guys

01:21.951 --> 01:24.214
about a time in my life
where my own family

01:24.214 --> 01:26.086
was going through something
very similar...

01:26.086 --> 01:28.218
<i>My parents had started
their own wrestling promotion</i>

01:28.218 --> 01:30.002
<i>company rivaling my grandma's.</i>

01:30.002 --> 01:32.048
<i>They put a lot of their
own money into the business,</i>

01:32.048 --> 01:33.397
<i>which meant downsizing from</i>

01:33.397 --> 01:35.095
<i>our decent-size apartment to...</i>

01:35.095 --> 01:36.618
An efficiency?

01:36.618 --> 01:38.141
Yep,
that's what they call it.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.404
- Why?
- Because it's so efficient.

01:40.404 --> 01:41.884
You can see everything you own

01:41.884 --> 01:43.146
and get a glass of water

01:43.146 --> 01:45.627
and see the TV
at the same time.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.282
Wait. Where's the bed?

01:48.282 --> 01:49.892
It's in the wall.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.852
You're gonna love this, Dewey.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.118
Yeah.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.990
It's also our closet.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.906
Don't answer that.
It's Afa.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.299
He's still pissed
about the booking conflict

02:05.299 --> 02:06.430
in Saudi Arabia.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.171
Don't be silly.
Afa is family.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.955
But--but, babe, don't.

02:09.955 --> 02:12.001
Hello, Afa?

02:14.003 --> 02:15.526
That was rude.

02:15.526 --> 02:18.964
The toilet doesn't also
come out of the wall, does it?

02:18.964 --> 02:20.357
It doesn't.

02:20.357 --> 02:22.359
But I would suggest
doing number two at school.

02:22.359 --> 02:25.580
<i>Since the efficiency
was so... efficient,</i>

02:25.580 --> 02:27.799
<i>everyone agreed that I should
stay with my grandma.</i>

02:27.799 --> 02:30.454
<i>Even though she and my parents
were at war in business,</i>

02:30.454 --> 02:32.369
<i>they never let me
become a casualty.</i>

02:32.369 --> 02:34.980
Another pineapple pancake,
Dewey?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.199
I can make a fresh batch.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.200
No, thanks, Grandma.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.506
I should get going.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.638
I want to get in
a full day of learning.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.379
<i>My life was
the perfect combination</i>

02:42.379 --> 02:45.687
<i>of lots of attention...</i>

02:45.687 --> 02:48.168
<i>with virtually no supervision.</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:49.473
I'm still not sure.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.301
Can I please try
the Brut again?

02:51.301 --> 02:54.435
Okay, this is the last time.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.182
<i>So with no real structure
at home,</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:04.227
<i>I sought it out
somewhere else,</i>

03:04.227 --> 03:06.142
<i>the weight room.</i>

03:09.232 --> 03:12.192
<i>It went on like that
for months,</i>

03:12.192 --> 03:15.760
<i>my parents trying and failing
to launch their promotion,</i>

03:15.760 --> 03:18.154
<i>my grandma pretending she
wasn't concerned about them,</i>

03:18.154 --> 03:19.851
<i>even though she was tracking
their every move.</i>

03:19.851 --> 03:23.203
<i>♪ This bloody road
remains a mystery ♪</i>

03:26.118 --> 03:27.032
<i>♪ This sudden darkness</i>

03:27.032 --> 03:28.512
<i>And me?</i>

03:28.512 --> 03:30.819
<i>♪ Fills the air</i>

03:33.735 --> 03:35.606
<i>♪ What are we waiting for?</i>

03:35.606 --> 03:37.521
<i>I went through
a growth spurt.</i>

03:37.521 --> 03:39.871
<i>♪ Won't anybody help us?</i>

03:39.871 --> 03:41.743
Slow down.
The man's not going anywhere.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.788
I want to visit my dad
without running into my mom,

03:43.788 --> 03:46.574
and I know she's having
her morning papaya right now.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.318
Hello.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.842
Mom, you're here early.

03:53.842 --> 03:54.843
No papaya today?

03:54.843 --> 03:58.281
Banana.
Better for on the go.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.543
Mmm.

03:59.543 --> 04:00.718
I was gonna drop these
by later,

04:00.718 --> 04:01.806
but you may as well take them
by now.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.068
Ooh, a present?

04:03.068 --> 04:04.983
Clothes,
because you won't stop growing.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.159
I had a nightmare
you ripped out of your outfits

04:07.159 --> 04:08.422
like the Incredible Hulk.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.727
Please don't make me angry.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.294
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.295
both: Ahh!

04:12.295 --> 04:13.557
Hey!

04:13.557 --> 04:15.385
It's the High Chief's
anniversary.

04:15.385 --> 04:18.083
Show some respect.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.346
Mom, do you want to go first?

04:19.346 --> 04:20.956
We've already talked.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.967
Hi, Dad.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.925
I wish you were here.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.623
I could really use
some of your advice.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.581
On what to do with their
failing business, High Chief.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.279
About our burgeoning business,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.802
which is already a big success.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.673
- But it's not really.
- Mom, do you mind?

04:42.673 --> 04:44.501
I'm trying to have a private
conversation with dad.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.938
What, can't a bereaved widow
talk to her husband

04:46.938 --> 04:49.680
on the anniversary
of his untimely passing?

04:49.680 --> 04:51.247
Rest in peace, High Chief.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.596
Just stop interrupting.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.598
- Oh, calm down.
- I am calm.

04:54.598 --> 04:55.991
Their second arena show
was a bust.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.341
Look, we were expecting
a bigger crowd, yes.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.387
They booked too big
of an arena

05:00.387 --> 05:01.953
and then couldn't fill it.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.086
Ha, the wind blew
our advertising posters away.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.783
Of course, the wind.

05:05.783 --> 05:09.526
Was the wind so excited
to get the Crockett wrestlers

05:09.526 --> 05:11.485
it didn't read the fine print
in the contract?

05:11.485 --> 05:12.834
Maybe you should spend
some time focusing

05:12.834 --> 05:14.226
on your own business
instead of talking about--

05:14.226 --> 05:15.140
Boo! I'm a skeleton.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.318
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.667
Afa's just parking the car.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.016
This place is a madhouse
on Saturdays.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.584
Well, this was fun.
You ready, babe?

05:23.584 --> 05:25.020
- Oh.
- Okay, great, let's go.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.152
<i>The family divide
was growing on all fronts,</i>

05:27.152 --> 05:30.547
<i>and I wondered if we were past
the point of no return.</i>

05:32.375 --> 05:34.421
<i>Despite the challenges
from home,</i>

05:34.421 --> 05:35.552
<i>some good news came
from abroad.</i>

05:35.552 --> 05:37.032
Oh, this one's for you.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.077
Whoever sent it must have spent
a fortune on stamps.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.252
'Ello, 'ello.

05:40.252 --> 05:41.471
Who's writing me letters
from England?

05:41.471 --> 05:43.125
Well,
if it's more tasteful nudes

05:43.125 --> 05:45.127
from your female fans,
they can go right in the bin.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.782
It's no nudes, just Andre.

05:47.782 --> 05:48.870
Oh.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.001
"Dear Rocky,
how are you?

05:50.001 --> 05:51.089
"I am fine.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.656
"I'm having fun in England,

05:52.656 --> 05:54.789
"even though the food here
is like the kind we give

05:54.789 --> 05:55.964
"to the pigs in France.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.879
"Please come visit.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.534
P.S.
I already buy you a ticket."

06:02.362 --> 06:05.452
Eh-hey-hey-hey,
first-class, baby.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.019
Andre knows I love
those ice-cold dinner rolls.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.414
But of course I can't go,

06:11.414 --> 06:13.024
not with the business
the way it is.

06:13.024 --> 06:15.070
I think you should go.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.812
Babe, you know
it's just not that simple.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.379
I can't.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.076
It's make-or-break time
for WPW.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.904
It wouldn't be right.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.340
Look, between the business
and my mom,

06:24.340 --> 06:25.602
we're both
under a lot of stress.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.169
I think it's a good time
to clear our heads

06:27.169 --> 06:28.736
and think strategically.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.825
Sorry, are you packing as
you're saying you're not going?

06:30.825 --> 06:32.392
No.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.919
Go.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.964
I love you, but this apartment
is too small for two people,

06:39.964 --> 06:42.010
let alone two married
business partners.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.839
We will deal with the WPW
when you get back.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.406
Go see Andre.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.538
Right-o.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.671
<i>John, shall I get it?</i>

06:50.671 --> 06:51.672
<i>No, hon, I got it.</i>

06:51.672 --> 06:55.676
<i>I got it. I got it.</i>

06:55.676 --> 06:59.593
<i>Come on, come on, come on.
Hello, anybody on the line?</i>

06:59.593 --> 07:01.508
Oh, no, the phoenix tattoo.

07:01.508 --> 07:05.425
Marlena, you've fallen in love
with Roman's murderer.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.872
I told you no one named Gina
lives here.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.264
No, it's me, Lah.

07:19.264 --> 07:20.831
Lia? Everything okay?

07:20.831 --> 07:21.963
Are we losing money somewhere?

07:21.963 --> 07:23.921
I was just calling
to say hello.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.010
- Why?
<i>- Oh, no reason.</i>

07:26.010 --> 07:28.056
Do you like the show
"Days of Our Lives"?

07:28.056 --> 07:29.884
I only watch documentaries
about baseball.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.494
Oh, you'd love it, Lah.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.540
There's this character
called John Black, and--

07:33.540 --> 07:36.499
There was a baseball team
called the Black Sox.

07:36.499 --> 07:39.981
And in 1919 their star,
Shoeless Joe Jackson--

07:39.981 --> 07:41.156
He would...

07:46.944 --> 07:47.989
Y-ello.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.252
Aha, Rocky, you snake.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.775
You thought you could
avoid me forever?

07:51.775 --> 07:54.778
<i>How are you gonna leave me
in [bleep] Saudi Arabia?</i>

07:54.778 --> 07:55.910
Who's that on the phone?

07:55.910 --> 07:58.173
- Uncle Afa.
- Tell him I said hi.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.609
You might want
to tell him yourself.

07:59.609 --> 08:00.828
<i>I don't [bleep] know
what to do!</i>

08:00.828 --> 08:03.526
- Afa.
<i>- [bleep].</i>

08:03.526 --> 08:06.921
<i>My mom and I both learned
some new vocabulary that day.</i>

08:10.402 --> 08:13.841
It's not my fault
being large and firm.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.886
I don't even go to the gym.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.061
Oh!

08:17.061 --> 08:19.150
- Cut.
- Cutting.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.939
You're supposed to throw
the rock behind you, Andre.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.462
- Oh.
- Remember?

08:26.462 --> 08:28.986
Yeah, and what was
that "large and firm"?

08:28.986 --> 08:30.597
I also forgot the words.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.513
Going again!

08:33.513 --> 08:35.253
Going again.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.478
Rocky.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.656
Ha-ha!

08:46.656 --> 08:48.440
Or I just we could just
take lunch.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.486
That's lunch!

08:53.228 --> 08:54.272
Not hungry?

08:54.272 --> 08:56.361
English food is disgusting.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.625
But Andre asked his agent
to organize a special lunch

08:58.625 --> 09:01.323
delivered just for him,
some lovely French cheese.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.630
Chicken and peas?

09:03.630 --> 09:05.588
Uh,
how's that chicken cooked?

09:05.588 --> 09:07.677
With peas.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.245
How about you, big fella?

09:10.245 --> 09:12.160
Let me guess, double peas.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.814
No, no, no, no.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.946
I want my <i>reblochon</i>
from <i>Le Plateau de Beaureguard.</i>

09:15.946 --> 09:17.165
Never met him, mate.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.036
All I've got is chicken
and peas.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.648
I don't the chicken and peas.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.780
I want my <i>reblochon</i>
from <i>Le Plateau de Beaureguard!</i>

09:23.780 --> 09:26.391
- Hey, Andre, it's--
- No, it's not okay, Rocky!

09:26.391 --> 09:28.611
Where is my cheese,
Englishman?

09:28.611 --> 09:30.265
Oh, cheese.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.658
Well, why didn't you say so?

09:34.008 --> 09:35.226
English cheddar.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.054
Best in the world.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.969
How many slices you want?

09:38.969 --> 09:40.710
I quit!

09:42.451 --> 09:43.800
I didn't get my chicken.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.629
Aha!

09:46.629 --> 09:51.025
He finally emerges
from behind the telephone.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.287
Uh, Sika.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.375
I thought you were Afa.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.203
You look the same
from the back.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.857
I'm sorry for yelling
at you just now.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.206
Oh, that's okay.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.077
I've dated a lot of yellers
over the years.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.470
It's an energy I'm used to.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.819
Oh.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.039
You look like you could use
a cup of tea.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.696
<i>While my mom was working
things out with my uncles,</i>

10:09.696 --> 10:11.654
<i>my growth spurt
and lack of supervision</i>

10:11.654 --> 10:14.048
<i>opened up a whole new world
for me.</i>

10:14.048 --> 10:15.789
Well,
I know what I want to see.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.182
- Me too.
- Me three.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.315
How about
"The Gods Must Be Crazy"?

10:21.185 --> 10:22.709
Ugh, fine.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.972
But it's rated R.
We need an adult.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.669
Guys, I got this.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.149
I just went
through a growth spurt.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.890
And I got a moustache.

10:29.890 --> 10:30.847
It's a done deal.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.109
Or I could go.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.242
I too recently completed
a growth spurt.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.113
And I also have
a couple lip hairs.

10:37.462 --> 10:40.596
You know what?
Yeah, Dewey should do it.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.206
Four tickets
for "Blue Velvet."

10:43.512 --> 10:45.645
I'm a teacher, by the way.
These are my students.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.344
You're taking teenagers
to see this movie?

10:49.344 --> 10:50.824
What class do you teach?

10:50.824 --> 10:53.043
Biology.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.915
Hm.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.178
Wish we had teachers like you
when I was in school.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.136
Enjoy the movie, Professor.
- Thanks.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.749
Mm.

11:02.749 --> 11:06.013
"I don't want peas.
I want cheese!"

11:08.058 --> 11:09.712
You're right.
You're right.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.148
I apologize, Rocky.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.194
But the English food
does not agree

11:13.194 --> 11:15.239
with my sophisticated
French palate.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.806
I once saw you fight
a dog on the beach

11:16.806 --> 11:17.938
for a turkey leg.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.114
Yeah, that dog was greedy

11:20.114 --> 11:21.550
and fat.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.729
It is very good to see you,
<i>mon ami.</i>

11:26.729 --> 11:29.776
Acting is fun,
but I miss my friends.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.342
Hey, me too.

11:31.342 --> 11:34.694
Getting WPW off the ground
has been battle after battle.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.434
I miss the simple days back
when we was on the road.

11:36.434 --> 11:37.827
<i>D'accord.</i>

11:37.827 --> 11:40.438
Everyone on set is always
telling Andre what to do.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.137
"Stand here, Andre.
Say this, Andre.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.747
Don't eat the prop food,
Andre."

11:44.747 --> 11:46.662
Just let Andre be Andre.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.882
It's like this beef
I got going on with Afa.

11:48.882 --> 11:52.320
I make a decision for myself
without consulting him,

11:52.320 --> 11:53.756
and I'm supposed to apologize?

11:53.756 --> 11:56.672
I'd rather give Lars Anderson
a body rub.

11:58.152 --> 12:01.764
Hey, to us,
two sensitive souls.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.942
The hell
you calling sensitive?

12:05.942 --> 12:07.770
<i>Whether it was Hawaii
or England,</i>

12:07.770 --> 12:09.816
<i>my family
couldn't avoid conflict.</i>

12:09.816 --> 12:11.818
Rocky.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.384
Rocky!

12:15.952 --> 12:18.563
You sure you don't want
a scone?

12:18.563 --> 12:19.869
They're apricot.
- Oh, no.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.001
Thank you.
This is perfect.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.959
And sorry again about earlier.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.569
All this stuff with my mom
and the business

12:24.569 --> 12:25.745
really has me on edge.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.137
Don't mention it.

12:27.137 --> 12:29.923
You know, sometimes it's not
about what it's about.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.316
Sika, what did I tell you
about using my shampoo

12:32.316 --> 12:33.665
as body wash, man?

12:33.665 --> 12:35.798
See?
This is a really good example.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.582
He isn't really mad
about the shampoo.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.975
He's made
because I forgot to tape

12:38.975 --> 12:40.411
"Unsolved Mysteries" for him.

12:40.411 --> 12:43.327
Someday if you want to get
your own shampoo, you...

12:46.591 --> 12:48.332
All I wanted was an apology,

12:48.332 --> 12:49.812
even a Rocky apology,

12:49.812 --> 12:51.074
where he blames it
on bad clams.

12:51.074 --> 12:54.512
But radio silence,
that's cold, man.

12:54.512 --> 12:55.905
Ice cold, bruh.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.820
You know what Rocky's like.
He doesn't mean it.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.343
He's just conflict-avoidant.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.172
All I'm saying is,
give him a break.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.695
Tell him to say he's sorry.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.088
Sorry or not,
you're still family.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.916
So you have to find a way
to make up.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.657
You need each other.
- Like you and Lia?

13:08.657 --> 13:10.311
That's different.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.187
Sensitive, my ass.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.363
Hey, can I get a ride
to the airport?

13:27.415 --> 13:28.590
I'm sorry, Rocky,

13:28.590 --> 13:30.810
you are sensitive
about being sensitive.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.333
I am not sensitive.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.943
It's not bad.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.858
Being sensitive means
you have lots of feelings.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.382
And feelings mean
you care about other people.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.557
Heh, picture Andre,

13:39.557 --> 13:41.864
sensitive and French.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.258
Twice the feelings.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.653
I do have a lot of feelings.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.874
And it's important to try
to understand them, huh?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.354
I learned this in California

13:53.354 --> 13:55.878
talking with a wise man
with glasses.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.185
It all goes back to childhood.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.014
What does?

14:01.014 --> 14:03.146
Everything,

14:03.146 --> 14:06.584
like Andre getting very upset
at cheese man today.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.891
Huh?

14:08.891 --> 14:12.721
I get upset because...

14:12.721 --> 14:15.158
I'm homesick.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.421
And the cheese
always reminds me of France.

14:19.467 --> 14:23.645
Maybe this is why
you're avoiding Afa too, no?

14:23.645 --> 14:25.125
You're right.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.910
I am?

14:27.910 --> 14:29.520
Hell no.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.914
Andre, I don't care
what hippy-dippy nonsense

14:31.914 --> 14:35.483
you picked up in California,
but childhood doesn't matter.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.789
I didn't even get to have
a childhood, and look.

14:37.789 --> 14:40.270
I turned out just fine.

14:40.270 --> 14:43.447
Mom kicked me out on my ass
at 13 years old,

14:43.447 --> 14:47.625
no thank yous, no nothing,
because I made her choose.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.672
She chose him, so I hitchhiked
my way up out of there

14:50.672 --> 14:52.979
with nothing.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.503
Everything I got
I had to build by myself.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.897
I built a whole life
out of nothing.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.463
I built Rocky Johnson
out of nothing.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.161
So I don't see how in the hell
that has anything

15:01.161 --> 15:02.989
to do with me avoiding Afa.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.252
Because when you were little,

15:05.252 --> 15:07.515
your family turned their back
on you.

15:07.515 --> 15:11.214
And you had to build a whole
new one out of nothing, huh?

15:11.214 --> 15:15.262
And maybe, just maybe you are
afraid of it happening again.

15:15.262 --> 15:19.919
And you do to them
before they can do to you.

15:29.537 --> 15:32.975
That was awesome.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.978
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's still early.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.588
We should keep
the night rolling.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.377
I'm gonna need to see
some ID.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.338
My ex-wife took the house.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.819
You're gonna try
to take my dignity too?

15:54.431 --> 15:55.824
Enjoy, guys.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.739
Beer's on me.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.526
Son, I am arrested you

16:02.526 --> 16:04.137
for providing alcohol
to minors.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.486
But I'm a minor.

16:05.486 --> 16:08.358
Sure you are, buddy,
and I'm Liza Minnelli.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.186
Watch your head.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.841
Officer Rogers here.

16:12.841 --> 16:15.452
Busted another perv
buying beer for minors.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.892
<i>I had a feeling my arrest
wouldn't ease tensions</i>

16:20.892 --> 16:21.893
<i>within the family.</i>

16:21.893 --> 16:23.939
Johnson, you're free to go.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.549
Free to go?

16:25.549 --> 16:27.029
He's all yours, Lia.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.509
You better keep an eye
on this one.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.901
Oh, I will.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.165
And I'm sorry
he caused such a ruckus.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.688
Thank you, Officer.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.907
Enjoy those pineapple muffins.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.561
Mahalo.

16:37.561 --> 16:40.782
Come on, Dewey,
you little rascal.

16:40.782 --> 16:41.783
Ow.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.089
- Get in the car.
- That hurts.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.053
Oh, come on, Grandma.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.750
I already said I'm sorry.

16:52.750 --> 16:53.751
Can't you give me a break?

16:53.751 --> 16:55.101
Give you a break?

16:55.101 --> 16:56.711
From what,

16:56.711 --> 16:59.061
sneaking your friends
into psychosexual thrillers?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.802
You know about that?

17:00.802 --> 17:03.065
First your mother and Rocky
betray me, and now you?

17:03.065 --> 17:05.633
You're supposed to be the one
person I can trust right now.

17:05.633 --> 17:08.810
And look what you've become,
a booze baron.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.169
I am happy
the High Chief isn't alive

17:20.169 --> 17:22.084
to see what a mess I've made.

17:22.084 --> 17:25.044
He came to this place
to start this business,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.481
to make a place for his family,
and I've ruined it.

17:27.481 --> 17:28.699
I've ruined everything.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.919
Grandma,
you know that's not true.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.791
And I promise I won't step out
of line again.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.750
<i>That didn't wind up
being true,</i>

17:35.750 --> 17:38.231
<i>but it felt right
to say in the moment.</i>

17:38.231 --> 17:41.625
I'm going to take my Golden
Wok into my room tonight.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.845
It's the dinner I deserve.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.465
Sh... Rocky.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.990
Look, I know I'm not the best
at apologies.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.558
So I thought I'd let
the card do the talking.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.171
Only one they had.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.871
So we good?

18:09.871 --> 18:10.959
Good?

18:12.308 --> 18:14.267
Of course we're good.
We family, brother.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.530
<i>Like he told my mom,
all my Uncle Afa</i>

18:16.530 --> 18:18.140
<i>needed was to hear an apology.</i>

18:18.140 --> 18:19.837
Hey, speaking of family,
I need a favor.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.970
Of course you do.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.235
Rocky?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.802
What's going on here?

18:27.802 --> 18:29.804
Where's the gang of teens
you saw vandalizing graves?

18:29.804 --> 18:31.849
- There were no teens.
- What?

18:31.849 --> 18:33.503
How can I put this?

18:33.503 --> 18:35.157
What are you doing here?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.855
And where is the photographer
from the "Headstone" magazine?

18:37.855 --> 18:40.162
Afa called me to tell me
Peter got the cover.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.772
There's no such thing
as "Headstone" magazine, Mom.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.122
Rocky and Afa lied to us.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.428
Had to, only way
to be sure both of you

18:45.428 --> 18:46.386
would show up to this.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.517
To what?

18:47.517 --> 18:49.606
This.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.217
It's my plan.
- What plan?

18:51.217 --> 18:52.261
This is a plan?

18:52.261 --> 18:55.308
Yes,
to bring you two together,

18:55.308 --> 18:58.659
so you could talk it out.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.051
I know it sounds dumb.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.966
But someone I trust told me
it helped him,

19:01.966 --> 19:04.055
so I figured
it could help you too.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.883
What are we supposed
to talk about?

19:05.883 --> 19:07.494
It doesn't matter.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.625
Okay?

19:08.625 --> 19:10.888
Just talk.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.029
John Black
has the phoenix tattoo.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.378
What?

19:22.378 --> 19:23.510
He's Roman's killer!

19:23.510 --> 19:25.076
Does Marlena know?
- She does.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.253
She wanted to get
away from him in the cabin,

19:27.253 --> 19:29.559
but he could sense her fear.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.387
Oh, my God.
When did this happen?

19:31.387 --> 19:34.303
I wanted to tell you,
and I kept trying to call you,

19:34.303 --> 19:36.218
and then I remembered
we're not speaking,

19:36.218 --> 19:37.567
and then I hang up again.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.352
That was you?

19:39.352 --> 19:41.789
Oh, Mom.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.752
I just wanted to say
what a great job

19:48.752 --> 19:50.363
you've been doing with Dewey.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.929
Well, you raised a good boy.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.888
<i>That wasn't true,
and my grandma knew it.</i>

19:53.888 --> 19:55.324
Not like John Black.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.891
John Black is an idiot.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.198
Oh, my God, so did she
run away from him or...

19:59.198 --> 20:02.113
<i>But she loved my mom
too much to let her know it.</i>

20:02.113 --> 20:03.941
<i>So my parents
and my grandmother,</i>

20:03.941 --> 20:05.508
they were able
to work themselves

20:05.508 --> 20:06.901
through a very
sticky situation,

20:06.901 --> 20:08.772
not by digging in
on their differences

20:08.772 --> 20:11.819
but by rallying around
what they had in common,

20:11.819 --> 20:13.342
what united them.

20:13.342 --> 20:16.519
Absolutely. Absolutely.

20:16.519 --> 20:20.131
Part of a healthy democracy
is the right to disagree.

20:20.131 --> 20:23.613
But it's our common ground
that will always bind us.

20:23.613 --> 20:24.962
As your prime minister,

20:24.962 --> 20:27.661
our nation's interest
will always be

20:27.661 --> 20:30.316
at the forefront of my agenda.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.013
Dwayne, do you mind
if I share with them

20:32.013 --> 20:34.015
what we spoke about
the other night?

20:34.015 --> 20:35.277
Sure.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.975
Well, it turns out
that Mr. Johnson here

20:37.975 --> 20:40.848
came to our country
with a secret agenda.

20:40.848 --> 20:44.286
He came to secure
a trade deal to export

20:44.286 --> 20:46.636
our Gjelgjiughm coffee
to the United States,

20:46.636 --> 20:48.682
a deal that I had
already rejected

20:48.682 --> 20:50.814
directly to President Taft.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.385
That is true.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.695
But I still feel
after spending time

21:01.695 --> 21:03.523
in your amazing country

21:03.523 --> 21:05.089
with your incredible people

21:05.089 --> 21:07.396
that we can come to terms
on a deal

21:07.396 --> 21:10.312
that is mutually beneficial.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.619
Well, as I said
to all of the critics

21:12.619 --> 21:15.012
when "Baywatch" the movie
came out,

21:15.012 --> 21:17.319
I respectfully disagree.

21:18.538 --> 21:21.192
Gjelgjiughm will never engage

21:21.192 --> 21:23.412
in a coffee trade deal
with the United States.
