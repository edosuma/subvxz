NETFLIX PRESENTS

BASED ON THE BOOK
"THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL"

01:36.375 --> 01:37.708
BY EDOARDO ALBINATI
PUBLISHED BY RIZZOLI

02:42.375 --> 02:43.500
Get us out!

02:43.583 --> 02:44.583
Please!

02:51.583 --> 02:53.625
Please, don't go away.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.416
Otherwise, they'll be back.

02:58.625 --> 02:59.625
Please.

03:11.958 --> 03:15.875
6 MONTHS BEFORE THE FACTS

03:26.416 --> 03:28.041
<i>I couldn't say when it all began.</i>

03:28.125 --> 03:29.541
Get in line!

03:29.625 --> 03:31.208
<i>But that story was about us all.</i>

03:31.291 --> 03:32.166
Back straight!

03:32.250 --> 03:36.208
<i>Our education,</i>
<i>our neighborhood, our school.</i>

03:36.875 --> 03:38.875
<i>After that,</i>
<i>nothing would ever be the same.</i>

03:38.958 --> 03:40.583
One, two.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.333
Let me hear your voice.

03:47.416 --> 03:48.666
One, two!

03:51.291 --> 03:54.625
<i>I was in my junior year</i>
<i>at a private high school,</i>

03:54.708 --> 03:56.500
<i>with a monthly tuition to pay.</i>

03:57.666 --> 03:59.291
<i>Girls weren't allowed to attend.</i>

03:59.375 --> 04:02.791
<i>We were all boys</i>
<i>from a middle-class neighborhood of Rome.</i>

04:02.875 --> 04:04.250
<i>Daddy's boys, essentially.</i>

04:04.333 --> 04:06.291
<i>One of my classmates was Salvatore,</i>

04:06.375 --> 04:08.750
<i>Angelo's brother,</i>
<i>who was a year older than us.</i>

04:08.833 --> 04:10.250
Let me see some strength!

04:11.500 --> 04:12.625
<i>And then Picchiatello,</i>

04:13.125 --> 04:14.833
<i>so called because he was a very weird guy.</i>

04:14.916 --> 04:17.750
<i>His mom was an actress</i>
<i>we all fantasized about.</i>

04:19.083 --> 04:20.500
<i>Gioacchino Rummo.</i>

04:21.000 --> 04:22.375
<i>Perhaps the only one who believed</i>

04:22.458 --> 04:24.833
<i>in the Christian values</i>
<i>that priests were trying to teach us.</i>

04:25.416 --> 04:26.791
<i>Except Brother Curzio.</i>

04:26.875 --> 04:29.333
<i>If you looked closely,</i>
<i>he didn't even seem a priest.</i>

04:29.416 --> 04:30.791
Running on the spot!

04:30.875 --> 04:32.291
One, two!

04:32.791 --> 04:35.541
Arbus, these are spasms, not gymnastics!

04:35.625 --> 04:38.666
Where are you going? Come on!

04:38.750 --> 04:41.583
One, two!

04:44.208 --> 04:46.833
<i>It was 1975,</i>

04:46.916 --> 04:48.958
<i>and violence was commonplace.</i>

05:04.875 --> 05:06.000
What happened, Pik?

05:09.791 --> 05:10.666
Romoli.

05:14.791 --> 05:18.000
He blew himself up
in front of the headmaster.

05:18.083 --> 05:21.541
-Oh, it's true!
-Grow up! Become a man, once and for all!

05:24.458 --> 05:25.333
D'Avenia.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.666
Let me guess,
you didn't see anything, did you?

05:33.750 --> 05:34.916
Like everyone else?

05:35.416 --> 05:37.875
One of your mates is attacked
in the courtyard

05:37.958 --> 05:39.625
and no one has seen a thing.

05:43.583 --> 05:44.458
Fine.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.375
If you have nothing to say, you can go.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.750
Romoli wasn't bothering anyone.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.625
As soon as the bell rang,

06:05.333 --> 06:07.416
the seniors approached him

06:07.916 --> 06:10.333
and surrounded him,
so nobody could see what they were doing.

06:10.416 --> 06:12.625
At first, they just gave him a few slaps.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.750
Then one grabbed his shirt
and started tugging at him.

06:19.416 --> 06:21.833
So his glasses just dropped off?

06:21.916 --> 06:22.791
No.

06:23.708 --> 06:25.166
They broke them on purpose.

06:25.666 --> 06:26.583
Good.

06:28.291 --> 06:29.416
Now tell me who did it.

06:30.166 --> 06:33.000
-No. Ask Jervi. He's the one who sent--
-Hey.

06:34.416 --> 06:35.916
I can hear it from you first.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.375
Guido.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.166
Your father is with the headmaster.

07:16.833 --> 07:19.833
They're young, but they have to understand
that we have rules here.

07:19.916 --> 07:23.041
Your parents decided
to send you to this school

07:23.125 --> 07:26.041
because obviously what they want for you

07:26.125 --> 07:28.875
is a safe harbor.

07:28.958 --> 07:33.208
Something to shelter you
from the… moral drift that--

07:33.291 --> 07:34.791
Headmaster, excuse me.

07:34.875 --> 07:38.916
Have you already started collecting
donations for Holy Easter, or…

07:42.541 --> 07:43.458
Not yet, but…

07:43.541 --> 07:44.500
Let me know.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.125
Let's go now.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.750
We won't trouble you further. Thank you.

07:49.583 --> 07:50.416
Gianni.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.875
Tell the janitor to send Jervi in.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.416
What got into you?

08:08.750 --> 08:09.875
What did I tell you?

08:14.166 --> 08:15.041
So?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.041
You made me look like a fucking moron.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.583
Come here.

08:24.666 --> 08:27.208
What did I tell you?

08:29.250 --> 08:31.625
Don't you ever dare to do it again!

08:32.708 --> 08:34.125
You must never do it again!

08:34.208 --> 08:35.541
I got it. Sorry.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.000
You made me look like a fucking moron.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.291
Like a fucking moron.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.291
From tomorrow, things will change.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.916
<i>Our life was full of rules.</i>

08:46.958 --> 08:49.166
<i>When we broke them,</i>
<i>sometimes we were punished,</i>

08:49.250 --> 08:50.916
<i>and other times nothing happened.</i>

08:51.416 --> 08:54.625
<i>So we wondered if those rules</i>
<i>had been established at random.</i>

08:55.958 --> 08:59.083
<i>When you turn six, you leave</i>
<i>your family shell and enter school.</i>

08:59.166 --> 09:00.208
<i>Another shell.</i>

09:01.583 --> 09:04.458
<i>In school, you risked acquiring</i>
<i>one of two attitudes.</i>

09:04.958 --> 09:07.333
<i>Subdue or be subdued.</i>

09:08.208 --> 09:10.166
Give them back!
Rachele, you can't take them.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.125
-Stop it.
-You're always stealing from me.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.791
Enough! I'll tell Mom.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.166
Stop it.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.250
-No!
-Mom, Rachele stole my shoes.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.625
That's not true! Don't lie.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.500
I don't care. You two sort it out.

09:20.583 --> 09:23.375
Elisabetta,
can you turn off the oven, please?

09:23.458 --> 09:24.791
-I'll be right there.
-Okay.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.583
Toby. Come on, go with them.

09:28.375 --> 09:29.208
So?

09:29.291 --> 09:31.333
So, I don't understand.

09:31.416 --> 09:33.083
They didn't do anything to them.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.208
They didn't take any action.

09:35.291 --> 09:37.833
They'll just buy him
a new pair of glasses and that's it.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.208
And it's done.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.583
What do you think
they should have done to them?

09:42.166 --> 09:44.208
Humiliate them in front of everyone?
Suspend them?

09:44.291 --> 09:46.791
What did human justice do to the Lord?

09:47.500 --> 09:50.166
It treated Him with hatred,
with thirst for revenge.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.958
Evil begets more evil.

09:52.041 --> 09:56.125
The behavior of Gioacchino's mates
must be understood and forgiven.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.291
Or we'll enter a spiral
from which we'll never escape.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.666
Sorry, Dad.
Aren't you the one who keeps saying

10:00.750 --> 10:03.625
that forgiveness should only
be granted after confession?

10:03.708 --> 10:08.000
Yes. But I also tell you not to put
too much trust in perfection.

10:08.791 --> 10:09.791
No, I'm good.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.666
And take heed of prejudices.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.375
Enough arguing.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.125
Girls. Here. Good girl.

10:15.208 --> 10:17.250
Giaele, food's ready.

10:22.416 --> 10:25.208
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.166
I'm not in the mood.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.125
Why?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.916
Because I'm fertile right now.

10:47.791 --> 10:50.166
And it's not a good time
to have another baby.

10:50.791 --> 10:52.625
Well, why not?

10:52.708 --> 10:54.875
I'm the one who'll have to carry it.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.041
We've already discussed this.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.125
Please.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.333
Hey! Big hair!

11:17.541 --> 11:20.041
-We got him in front of everyone.
-Glasses?

11:20.708 --> 11:22.708
Snap! Tomorrow they'll have tape on.

11:29.416 --> 11:31.250
-How did it go with your dad?
-As usual.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.541
He gave me a fucking hard time,
but in the end, he stopped.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.250
He said he won't let me out anymore.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.791
And you, Giampie'?

11:38.375 --> 11:39.708
Not a word.

11:39.791 --> 11:41.291
-For real?
-Obviously.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.375
-Your granddad built the school.
-Exactly.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.208
And my dad gives them money every year.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.958
The headmaster
should just shut his mouth. That's it.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.166
They're pissing me off.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.416
Well said, Angelo!

11:51.500 --> 11:52.708
-Wanna get a drink?
-Yes.

11:52.791 --> 11:53.625
Okay. Well…

11:54.291 --> 11:55.291
Angelo.

11:56.166 --> 11:58.541
-Andrea is about to be released from jail.
-What?

11:58.625 --> 11:59.916
I've just been told.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.125
It's gonna be soon.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.041
Are we gonna be here all night?

12:05.125 --> 12:05.958
Any ideas?

12:06.041 --> 12:07.166
I don't know, really.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.208
Let's decide something. Let's do…

12:09.291 --> 12:11.500
In fact, I think I do have an idea.

12:13.916 --> 12:15.708
Put it back!

12:20.750 --> 12:21.958
Angelo.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.000
-What?
-Where have you been?

12:24.083 --> 12:26.625
Where do you think I've been?
With my friends.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.166
Why do you always make me worry?

12:29.250 --> 12:31.375
Worry about what? I'm here with you.

12:31.458 --> 12:32.625
Let's go to bed.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.916
I know you're awake.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.791
Gianni told me what happened at school.

12:50.875 --> 12:51.916
What did he tell you?

12:52.416 --> 12:53.625
That they questioned you.

12:53.708 --> 12:54.541
Yes.

12:55.291 --> 12:58.208
The headmaster kept us at school
because he wanted to know who did it.

12:59.166 --> 13:00.750
-And did you tell him?
-No.

13:00.833 --> 13:01.666
Are you sure?

13:04.541 --> 13:05.708
Well done.

13:05.791 --> 13:07.000
You kept your mouth shut.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.166
Never be a snitch.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.750
-Understood?
-Yes.

13:14.666 --> 13:15.500
Yes, what?

13:16.166 --> 13:17.958
One should never be a snitch.

13:28.791 --> 13:30.875
<i>Any other sins to confess?</i>

13:31.708 --> 13:33.083
<i>I tell a lot of lies.</i>

13:33.166 --> 13:34.041
<i>That's bad.</i>

13:34.625 --> 13:36.250
Lying is a serious sin.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.875
What kind of lies?

13:41.166 --> 13:42.208
All kinds.

13:45.416 --> 13:47.250
In order to be accepted by others.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.666
<i>I pretend to have the same passions.</i>

13:52.416 --> 13:53.583
<i>The same ideas.</i>

13:55.458 --> 13:57.916
<i>I wish I didn't do it.</i>
<i>It makes things worse for me, Father.</i>

13:58.000 --> 14:00.166
ST LUIGI HIGH SCHOOL

14:00.250 --> 14:01.875
<i>Because in the end I feel lonely.</i>

14:02.375 --> 14:04.500
It may seem
like I'm at ease with everyone.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.250
And I get along with everyone.

14:10.666 --> 14:13.041
But I'm never
really comfortable with anyone.

14:16.916 --> 14:19.041
I am never really myself, Father.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.333
You seriously told him in confession
that you don't believe in God?

14:35.916 --> 14:37.416
What if he reports you?

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
I'm leaving this school, anyway.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.916
I'm not learning anything.
I don't trust the teachers.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.333
They should know stuff,
yet they don't even know they don't know.

14:45.416 --> 14:46.708
They assume.

14:46.791 --> 14:48.916
Their authority is based on nothing.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.000
So, who do you trust?

14:54.625 --> 14:55.625
I trust you.

14:57.666 --> 14:59.583
You've chosen the wrong person.

15:00.083 --> 15:03.041
Now it's reduced
to a simple quadratic equation.

15:03.666 --> 15:06.750
Which I assume
you all know very well, right?

15:07.333 --> 15:08.583
So what's your plan?

15:08.666 --> 15:11.041
Once you've solved the equation…

15:11.125 --> 15:12.333
I'll do two years in one.

15:13.083 --> 15:14.833
I'll get my diploma one year early.

15:15.333 --> 15:18.458
You need to have a B average
in all sophomore subjects.

15:18.541 --> 15:21.208
-And take all junior-year exams.
-I know.

15:21.291 --> 15:22.291
Arbus!

15:23.125 --> 15:26.333
Since you're so chatty
this morning, come here.

15:26.416 --> 15:28.708
Solve the equation for us. Come on.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.083
This one?

15:42.708 --> 15:43.541
Yes.

16:01.208 --> 16:02.375
<i>Arbus.</i>

16:02.916 --> 16:04.875
<i>He was seen as a phenomenon by us all.</i>

16:04.958 --> 16:08.083
<i>He was worshiped,</i>
<i>and thus kept at a distance.</i>

16:08.166 --> 16:09.416
Okay, Arbus.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.833
You may return to your seat.

16:11.625 --> 16:14.416
<i>The greatest thing about Arbus</i>
<i>is that he would never flinch</i>

16:14.500 --> 16:15.875
<i>and never lose hope.</i>

16:16.625 --> 16:18.708
<i>Arbus was admired by all of us.</i>

16:20.041 --> 16:22.000
<i>Jervi was too, but for other reasons.</i>

17:24.916 --> 17:26.583
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.166
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.291
The body of Christ.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.666
Mom.

17:44.583 --> 17:45.416
What?

17:45.500 --> 17:48.666
-Why can't I take the communion?
-Because you can't, sweetheart.

17:49.833 --> 17:50.791
But why?

17:52.458 --> 17:55.208
It's the way it is.
When you grow up, I'll explain it to you.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.833
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

17:57.916 --> 17:59.083
Let's pray.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.500
In the name of Christ, Our Lord.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.875
Amen.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.500
-Gioacchino.
-Yes?

18:07.583 --> 18:09.750
Where are your schoolmates?

18:09.833 --> 18:11.458
Don't they attend Mass?

18:11.541 --> 18:13.625
They attend the compulsory ones at school.

18:16.458 --> 18:19.166
What's the point of sending their kids
to a Catholic school?

18:19.250 --> 18:21.208
Maybe their parents work.
They don't have time.

18:21.291 --> 18:24.750
I get it, but not one
out of 20 boys. It's absurd.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.208
APOLLINAIRE'S IMMORAL TALES

18:29.833 --> 18:31.166
Mom!

18:32.750 --> 18:34.875
-Sweetheart.
-Didn't you see the car?

18:34.958 --> 18:36.458
What would I do without you?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.791
-Hey, are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.541
5 MONTHS BEFORE THE FACTS

19:01.291 --> 19:04.666
We could build a nice little house here
if we get the permits.

19:04.750 --> 19:05.750
Right?

19:06.583 --> 19:09.750
We could split the property.
One for you, one for your brother.

19:09.833 --> 19:10.791
That'd be nice.

19:12.916 --> 19:14.125
It could work.

19:18.916 --> 19:19.916
Look.

19:26.916 --> 19:27.916
Ruma.

19:34.375 --> 19:35.375
Again.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.208
You get emotional.

19:40.541 --> 19:43.083
I've told you many times.
You have to be cold-blooded.

19:43.958 --> 19:44.833
You aim.

19:45.791 --> 19:46.791
You shoot.

19:47.708 --> 19:48.666
Let's go.

19:52.791 --> 19:57.833
<i>The three pillars of our education</i>
<i>were persuasion, threat, and punishment.</i>

19:59.666 --> 20:01.750
<i>But they were more</i>
<i>like steps than pillars.</i>

20:01.833 --> 20:05.583
<i>If explanations and threats failed,</i>
<i>we then had to be punished.</i>

20:07.291 --> 20:10.375
<i>In my neighborhood, great ambitions</i>
<i>were either lacking altogether</i>

20:10.458 --> 20:12.750
<i>or manifested themselves catastrophically.</i>

20:13.500 --> 20:14.666
<i>The underlying moral was</i>

20:14.750 --> 20:18.000
<i>that everything that was transient</i>
<i>was unbearable.</i>

20:18.083 --> 20:21.500
<i>And since everything is transient,</i>
<i>everything was ultimately unbearable.</i>

20:21.583 --> 20:22.916
<i>Except in Arbus' family.</i>

20:23.000 --> 20:23.916
Good morning.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.541
<i>His father taught</i>
<i>mathematical logic at university.</i>

20:26.625 --> 20:29.625
<i>He seemed more interested in his students</i>
<i>than in his children.</i>

20:29.708 --> 20:30.625
Okay.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.583
This is identical to your house.

20:35.666 --> 20:37.583
My dad built it for my sister.

20:38.166 --> 20:40.416
He was obsessed
with a hacksaw and balsa wood.

20:57.000 --> 20:57.875
Come on.

21:01.791 --> 21:03.791
<i>Bonjour. </i>I've brought you a snack.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.166
Mom, please.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.500
<i>Monsieur.</i>

21:06.583 --> 21:08.000
Hello, ma'am. I'm Edoardo.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.083
Hey, Edoardo.

21:09.166 --> 21:10.166
How is it?

21:14.458 --> 21:16.166
My son is so absentminded.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.750
What's in this big head of yours?

21:17.833 --> 21:19.083
Secrets?

21:20.083 --> 21:21.875
No, no secrets, of course.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.708
What about you, Edoardo?

21:24.791 --> 21:26.375
Do you have secrets?

21:26.458 --> 21:27.375
Me?

21:27.458 --> 21:29.583
Yes, things you don't tell your mom.

21:29.666 --> 21:31.291
What are they? Tell me.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.583
Actually, I hardly tell her anything.

21:35.875 --> 21:36.875
So…

21:37.666 --> 21:38.750
Of course.

21:39.583 --> 21:40.916
What are you studying?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.041
Chemistry.

21:43.666 --> 21:44.541
Well,

21:44.625 --> 21:48.916
since we know chemistry already,
how about a game of poker?

22:04.291 --> 22:05.333
Ten thousand.

22:05.416 --> 22:06.333
Call.

22:07.541 --> 22:08.458
Fold.

22:11.916 --> 22:12.916
Two pairs.

22:16.375 --> 22:17.375
Straight.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.625
Put that stupid sword down.

22:48.708 --> 22:49.916
You'll hurt yourself.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.875
Mom, don't you see how skilled I am?

22:58.875 --> 22:59.750
I'm hungry.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.416
Are you hungry?

23:01.500 --> 23:02.500
I'm hungry.

23:03.250 --> 23:05.250
Call Fernanda. I have a headache.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.291
Fernanda?

23:10.791 --> 23:11.625
Fernanda?

23:11.708 --> 23:13.541
Why are you shouting? I told you…

23:13.625 --> 23:14.791
Fernanda!

23:14.875 --> 23:16.291
I have a headache.

23:16.375 --> 23:17.958
Fernanda!

23:18.041 --> 23:19.583
Fernanda!

23:19.666 --> 23:21.958
Can you stop being a clown, for once?

23:23.625 --> 23:25.666
-Yes. Okay.
-Go.

23:33.625 --> 23:38.541
Enzo!

23:38.625 --> 23:43.208
Enzo!

23:44.041 --> 23:46.416
Guys! Calm down a bit.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.916
Sorry, Brother Curzio.

23:52.125 --> 23:53.416
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

23:57.625 --> 23:58.875
The one on the right.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.875
This is mine.
Why are you getting three beds?

24:08.041 --> 24:09.125
Where did you find that?

24:09.208 --> 24:10.875
Guess. Under the bed.

24:10.958 --> 24:12.041
Under the bed.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.833
Pik. Look.

24:13.916 --> 24:15.708
-At the bottom.
-It's not there.

24:15.791 --> 24:18.000
It's there. You have to look for it.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.375
He's so dumb.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.125
-Who?
-You.

24:21.208 --> 24:22.458
-Me?
-Yes.

24:29.625 --> 24:32.291
So, I asked you to come here this morning

24:32.375 --> 24:34.750
because I'd like to begin this…

24:35.291 --> 24:38.958
this conversation of ours
in front of this painting.

24:39.541 --> 24:42.125
Quite simply, I'd like you to tell me,

24:42.875 --> 24:44.625
freely,

24:46.250 --> 24:47.666
what you're seeing in it.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.750
Go on. Freely.

24:54.791 --> 24:56.291
Well, Professor,

24:57.166 --> 24:59.750
I see some men beating Jesus.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.458
There are six men

25:03.125 --> 25:04.416
beating Jesus.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.041
How would you define these six men?

25:07.125 --> 25:08.500
They're persecutors.

25:09.125 --> 25:10.208
Persecutors.

25:13.291 --> 25:14.541
And who's the victim?

25:15.041 --> 25:16.208
Well, Jesus.

25:19.375 --> 25:20.375
Are you sure?

25:20.875 --> 25:23.083
It seems to me that the persecutors

25:24.416 --> 25:25.916
are victims too.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.666
Because those who hurt others

25:29.333 --> 25:30.875
hurt themselves too.

25:32.291 --> 25:33.833
-Right?
-Right.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.958
I'd add that they
are not the only perpetrators.

25:38.041 --> 25:38.958
Jesus is too.

25:39.625 --> 25:42.541
He's using their evil to rise above them.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.333
In order to be perfect.

25:46.166 --> 25:49.333
Isn't this perfection
a display of arrogance, perhaps?

25:49.416 --> 25:50.500
What are you saying?

25:50.583 --> 25:53.333
Good is perfection, and perfection is God.

25:54.208 --> 25:57.541
I believe you should start considering

25:57.625 --> 26:00.541
that perhaps the devil manifests itself

26:00.625 --> 26:03.250
when we are in the right.

26:03.333 --> 26:08.583
When we feel inebriated by our perfection.

26:08.666 --> 26:11.291
So you're saying that when we behave well,

26:11.916 --> 26:14.208
we're following the devil's suggestions.

26:15.125 --> 26:18.375
Therefore, there is no difference
between the saint and his tormentors?

26:18.458 --> 26:19.958
Of course there is.

26:20.041 --> 26:21.666
Jesus is a man too.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.416
He became a man

26:24.500 --> 26:27.458
and, as such,
he takes part in our imperfection.

26:27.541 --> 26:28.958
Because He holds inside

26:29.458 --> 26:31.416
the seeds of evil.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.875
We become men

26:33.958 --> 26:35.666
by inheriting evil.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.791
By perpetrating evil.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.666
And being victims of evil.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.041
In order to be a victim of evil,

26:46.666 --> 26:49.625
someone must surely perpetrate it.

26:51.666 --> 26:52.666
What then?

26:53.708 --> 26:55.083
You don't agree, Gioacchino?

26:55.166 --> 26:56.666
I don't know, I…

26:57.833 --> 27:00.833
I believe we become men
by doing good deeds.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.750
You seem to be saying
that we only become men

27:03.833 --> 27:05.625
by perpetrating evil. I don't…

27:07.333 --> 27:08.458
I don't understand.

27:08.541 --> 27:11.708
So, Professor Golgota's talking nonsense.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.583
Hey. All clear. Let's go.

27:20.250 --> 27:22.333
-Where are you going?
-Hurry up. Let's go.

27:22.416 --> 27:23.791
-Me?
-Yes, come on.

27:27.791 --> 27:28.625
Hi.

27:29.416 --> 27:30.416
What are you doing?

27:30.500 --> 27:33.166
We're re-enacting
the painting we saw earlier.

27:34.750 --> 27:35.833
And why am I here?

27:35.916 --> 27:37.208
You are the protagonist.

27:37.291 --> 27:38.541
-Clothes off.
-You're Jesus.

27:38.625 --> 27:39.875
-Go on.
-Do I take my shirt off?

27:39.958 --> 27:42.791
-Yes. Bare your chest, like Him.
-Get naked.

27:42.875 --> 27:43.875
All right.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.208
-Here?
-Go on, on your knees.

27:50.291 --> 27:51.833
-On your knees.
-Come on.

27:55.625 --> 27:56.875
Down.

27:56.958 --> 27:57.916
Ouch!

28:04.958 --> 28:06.875
Hey! What are you doing?

28:14.375 --> 28:15.541
You coward!

28:16.875 --> 28:17.833
You sinner.

28:19.708 --> 28:20.750
Stop now!

28:20.833 --> 28:21.833
Sinner!

28:21.916 --> 28:23.041
Yeah, that's enough.

28:23.125 --> 28:24.458
Say you don't believe in anything.

28:25.333 --> 28:26.708
Renounce your god, you snitch!

28:27.791 --> 28:29.000
Renounce your faith.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.875
Stay still, D'Avenia.

28:30.958 --> 28:32.000
Renounce it.

28:34.375 --> 28:35.958
What the fuck are you doing?

28:39.125 --> 28:40.666
Have you lost your minds?

29:00.333 --> 29:01.958
You sinner.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.125
You like being flogged, don't you?

29:19.375 --> 29:21.541
<i>Being born male is an incurable illness.</i>

29:22.458 --> 29:24.375
That faggot deserved it.

29:25.125 --> 29:27.375
<i>You had to be ready to do</i>
<i>or suffer all sort of things</i>

29:27.458 --> 29:30.125
<i>in order to obtain</i>
<i>the approval of your peers.</i>

29:30.208 --> 29:32.750
<i>You had to prove you were strong,</i>
<i>even if you were weak.</i>

29:33.458 --> 29:35.666
<i>Every day, you had to prove</i>
<i>you were a real man.</i>

29:35.750 --> 29:39.250
<i>Then you had to start again from scratch</i>
<i>and prove it all over again.</i>

29:40.375 --> 29:43.791
<i>If you failed once,</i>
<i>you would be marked forever.</i>

29:49.416 --> 29:52.875
TOMORROW NIGHT AT 3 AM
AT THE DEVIL'S CHAIR

29:52.958 --> 29:56.208
<i>I do not like dick!</i>

29:57.541 --> 29:58.375
<i>Say it!</i>

30:00.166 --> 30:02.583
Girls. Do you like them or not?

30:03.250 --> 30:04.625
Yes, of course.

30:06.083 --> 30:07.750
What do you like about them?

30:10.291 --> 30:13.583
If the question is too hard,
tell me what you don't like about males.

30:14.291 --> 30:16.000
Body hair? Facial hair?

30:16.708 --> 30:17.833
-Well…
-Whatever.

30:18.541 --> 30:20.500
I'll tell you what you don't like.

30:21.791 --> 30:23.250
You don't like dick.

30:27.208 --> 30:30.625
I don't like dick.

30:32.166 --> 30:33.000
Say it.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.625
I don't like dick.

30:40.000 --> 30:40.875
Say it!

30:40.958 --> 30:42.166
I don't like dick.

30:45.625 --> 30:51.083
130 HOURS BEFORE THE FACTS

30:51.666 --> 30:52.541
-Come on!
-No!

30:52.625 --> 30:53.458
No.

30:54.583 --> 30:55.791
Come on.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.791
-Hi, girls.
-Hi.

30:59.875 --> 31:00.833
Where are you going?

31:00.916 --> 31:02.375
I'm going home. And you?

31:02.458 --> 31:04.916
Can you give us a lift?
We missed our tram.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.583
-Where?
-Montagnola.

31:07.416 --> 31:09.416
-Where's that?
-Montagnola.

31:10.291 --> 31:13.125
Do you know Grotta Perfetta Street,
on the Laurentina?

31:13.208 --> 31:14.125
Near the EUR?

31:14.208 --> 31:15.958
-I see, the EUR!
-Yes.

31:16.041 --> 31:16.916
It's quite far.

31:18.125 --> 31:18.958
Go on, then.

31:23.291 --> 31:25.916
-Can you open it?
-Oh my God.

31:26.000 --> 31:26.833
There.

31:26.916 --> 31:28.208
Sorry.

31:28.708 --> 31:30.041
It's like a spaceship!

31:32.583 --> 31:34.125
Have you seen how they get better?

31:34.208 --> 31:35.833
They'll be making flying cars next.

31:35.916 --> 31:39.041
By the way, my name is Donatella.
She's Nadia.

31:39.125 --> 31:39.958
I'm Carlo.

31:40.041 --> 31:42.250
You'll have to give me directions.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.625
-I only know how to get to Colombo Street.
-Sure.

31:45.416 --> 31:46.708
What do you do? Do you work?

31:46.791 --> 31:48.708
No, I'm in my last year at school.

31:48.791 --> 31:51.333
Oh. How come you've got a car, then?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.625
It's my dad's, but I use it often.

31:54.291 --> 31:56.458
How about you?
What are you doing around here?

31:56.541 --> 31:57.833
We went to the movies.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.083
We saw <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show.</i>

32:00.166 --> 32:02.416
-I haven't seen it yet.
-It's insane.

32:08.166 --> 32:09.625
Wasn't it screening in your area?

32:09.708 --> 32:12.916
What, is giving us a lift
that much trouble?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.458
No, of course not. I was just curious.

32:15.541 --> 32:16.833
-I'm just joking.
-All right.

32:16.916 --> 32:20.041
A friend of ours
who's a photographer lives nearby.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.166
He says that maybe he'll get us some work.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.458
What do you do?

32:23.541 --> 32:24.625
We're models.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.541
I mean, we'd like to be.

32:27.333 --> 32:29.250
I see! I'm sure you'll be great.

32:31.041 --> 32:33.416
-Can I ask you for a cigarette?
-Sure.

32:33.500 --> 32:34.333
Thank you.

32:34.416 --> 32:35.875
-Voilà.
-Very kind.

32:37.791 --> 32:40.250
-Can I put it on?
-Yes.

32:41.208 --> 32:43.000
-Do you like Battisti?
-I do.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.416
Aren't you singing?

34:33.458 --> 34:35.500
Thanks again. Call us if you like.

34:35.583 --> 34:36.500
Okay, sure.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.166
Thanks.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.416
-Bye.
-Bye.

34:48.708 --> 34:49.666
Bye.

34:50.166 --> 34:51.125
See you.

35:37.958 --> 35:40.500
Sweetheart. Hey.

35:40.583 --> 35:43.041
Sleep now.

35:43.125 --> 35:44.833
Under the blanket. There.

35:46.083 --> 35:47.541
Good night, Giaele.

35:47.625 --> 35:50.125
Mom. And the prayer?

35:50.208 --> 35:51.083
Come on, say it.

35:51.583 --> 35:56.208
Dear Jesus, protect Lia, Mom, Dad,

35:56.291 --> 36:01.250
Gioacchino, Ezechiele and Elisabetta,

36:01.333 --> 36:03.666
Rachele, Tobia.

36:03.750 --> 36:05.583
Well done, my love.

36:06.250 --> 36:07.541
Very good. Now sleep.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.166
<i>Accepting an invitation could be risky.</i>

36:24.250 --> 36:26.958
<i>But if you turned it down,</i>
<i>you'd lose masculinity points.</i>

36:27.500 --> 36:29.208
<i>That's why I felt privileged</i>

36:29.291 --> 36:31.750
<i>to be invited to the Devil's Chair.</i>

36:33.666 --> 36:37.083
<i>The secret of our education</i>
<i>was to let the aggression out.</i>

36:37.583 --> 36:39.041
<i>Otherwise, it would build up.</i>

36:39.583 --> 36:41.416
<i>But without going too far,</i>

36:41.500 --> 36:43.750
<i>or we would have drifted into fascism.</i>

37:30.416 --> 37:32.458
Where were you?
We've been waiting for an hour.

37:32.541 --> 37:35.000
I met two girls. I gave them a lift home.

37:35.083 --> 37:36.416
Why didn't you bring them?

37:36.500 --> 37:38.291
They wanted a lift home.

37:38.375 --> 37:39.375
Home? Where?

37:39.458 --> 37:41.125
-They live far away.
-Where?

37:41.208 --> 37:42.166
In Montagnola.

37:43.625 --> 37:46.083
He ended up with some undesirables!

37:46.166 --> 37:47.666
So you went out whoring!

37:47.750 --> 37:49.500
You're the one who does that.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.583
I can deal with girls.

37:51.666 --> 37:54.833
Anyone would know how to deal with them.
They can't even speak.

37:54.916 --> 37:56.458
We don't want to talk to them.

37:56.541 --> 37:57.416
Introduce us.

37:58.291 --> 37:59.916
As if they'd give you their number!

38:00.000 --> 38:02.208
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Look.

38:03.125 --> 38:05.583
-Here it is.
-Look here.

38:05.666 --> 38:07.375
-On my hand.
-On his little hand.

38:07.458 --> 38:10.333
-Let the master work.
-On his little hand.

38:10.416 --> 38:13.166
-Let the master work.
-On his hand.

38:13.250 --> 38:14.666
All right, then. Let's call them.

38:14.750 --> 38:15.916
Come on.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.625
-Go on, call your new friends.
-Come on.

38:18.708 --> 38:20.666
<i>We were the first generation to enjoy</i>

38:20.750 --> 38:23.125
<i>virtually limitless freedom.</i>

38:24.541 --> 38:26.083
<i>Our families seemed solid,</i>

38:26.166 --> 38:28.750
<i>but everything was</i>
<i>more fragile than it looked.</i>

38:28.833 --> 38:30.125
Edo!

38:30.666 --> 38:32.041
Can you help me with the test?

38:32.125 --> 38:33.416
No, Pik, don't…

38:33.500 --> 38:34.958
<i>Fathers were absent.</i>

38:35.041 --> 38:36.666
<i>Like Pik's father.</i>

38:36.750 --> 38:38.416
<i>No one had ever seen him.</i>

38:38.500 --> 38:40.083
<i>No one knew anything about him.</i>

38:40.750 --> 38:43.541
<i>But no one had the guts</i>
<i>to ask Pik where he was.</i>

38:52.000 --> 38:54.291
Shall we say three o'clock? Three thirty?

38:54.916 --> 38:55.875
Three fifteen?

38:55.958 --> 38:57.208
Three thirty is fine.

39:03.375 --> 39:04.541
<i>"E profundam."</i>

39:05.250 --> 39:06.250
Ablative?

39:06.916 --> 39:08.583
Ablative? Yes.

39:08.666 --> 39:09.708
One second.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.583
No, accusative.

39:12.666 --> 39:13.583
-Accusative?
-Yes.

39:14.458 --> 39:15.458
Okay.

39:19.416 --> 39:22.125
Mom is beautiful, isn't she?
She was an actress before I was born.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.541
She was great.

39:25.708 --> 39:26.708
Mom!

39:28.500 --> 39:29.625
Mom!

39:29.708 --> 39:31.625
-Why are you calling her?
-I'll introduce you.

39:31.708 --> 39:34.250
-No--
-Mom!

39:34.333 --> 39:36.625
Mom!

39:36.708 --> 39:37.916
Why are you yelling?

39:38.958 --> 39:40.458
I wanted you to meet Edoardo.

39:41.166 --> 39:43.125
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.875
Thanks for coming to help my son study.

39:45.958 --> 39:47.583
It's nothing, I don't…

39:47.666 --> 39:49.750
-Well, he needs it.
-My snack.

39:50.416 --> 39:52.208
Is that the way to ask for it?

39:52.708 --> 39:54.375
How am I supposed to ask?

39:56.833 --> 39:59.333
I don't know. Look at your friend Edoardo.

40:00.166 --> 40:02.750
Does he look like someone
who asks his mom for everything?

40:09.625 --> 40:10.750
I will never make it.

40:12.666 --> 40:14.625
For sure you won't, if you don't start.

40:16.166 --> 40:17.500
Come on, I can't be late.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.125
-Just write.
-Okay, thanks.

40:21.208 --> 40:23.125
"All the dangers…"

40:23.208 --> 40:24.125
"All the…"

40:26.125 --> 40:27.333
"…of death…"

40:27.916 --> 40:31.208
"…dan… gers… of death"?

41:29.291 --> 41:32.833
3 MONTHS BEFORE THE FACTS

41:38.500 --> 41:41.916
Cockroaches have been living on Earth
for 320 million years.

41:42.791 --> 41:43.833
They are fast.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.791
And hard to kill.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.208
Because they have an exoskeleton,

41:50.291 --> 41:51.666
which is hard,

41:51.750 --> 41:53.583
but at the same time flexible.

41:55.666 --> 41:57.375
It's a body that can mutate.

41:57.458 --> 41:58.458
Change.

41:59.375 --> 42:02.000
And everything
that causes change is violent.

42:03.625 --> 42:07.166
Violent changes destroy,
but also create at the same time.

42:08.458 --> 42:09.541
See?

42:10.375 --> 42:12.041
I should kill him exactly here,

42:12.125 --> 42:14.208
just here, in the chest.

42:15.250 --> 42:16.833
Then yes, he would die.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.708
That would be the easiest way.

42:20.833 --> 42:22.083
It's the same with people.

42:24.333 --> 42:27.750
It's pointless to waste time
looking for a way to kill a man.

42:28.625 --> 42:30.416
There's no need to overthink it.

42:33.291 --> 42:34.125
Sure,

42:35.416 --> 42:37.833
a pierced chest
would be a terrible way to die.

42:39.541 --> 42:40.875
Hey, bear.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.041
Hurry up.

42:42.125 --> 42:43.666
-I'll see you next week.
-Come on.

42:43.750 --> 42:45.666
-Thank you.
-Bye.

42:45.750 --> 42:47.583
-Why don't you stay?
-I have to go.

42:47.666 --> 42:49.208
-All right.
-Thank you.

43:37.666 --> 43:39.041
<i>It became clear to me</i>

43:39.125 --> 43:42.708
<i>that the madness of one family member</i>
<i>ended in another one's quirks.</i>

43:44.125 --> 43:45.750
<i>Arbus wasn't a violent guy.</i>

43:46.666 --> 43:48.500
<i>Yet he was obsessed with death.</i>

43:50.375 --> 43:52.625
<i>If even Arbus' family</i>
<i>was attracted to evil,</i>

43:52.708 --> 43:54.875
<i>perhaps Professor Golgota was right.</i>

43:54.958 --> 43:57.958
<i>Maybe, in order to become men,</i>
<i>it was necessary to experience evil.</i>

44:00.833 --> 44:01.708
Hi there.

44:02.416 --> 44:03.708
-Hi.
-Remember me? Monica.

44:03.791 --> 44:06.583
We met last summer at the Circeo.

44:07.125 --> 44:08.541
Oh, yeah, Monica. Sorry.

44:09.125 --> 44:09.958
What are you doing?

44:10.041 --> 44:11.458
Well, I was going home.

44:11.541 --> 44:13.416
You never called me back.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.541
Because I'd lost your number,
so I couldn't…

44:15.625 --> 44:17.166
It's okay, I'll give it to you again.

44:18.333 --> 44:20.916
Let me write it here,
so you won't lose it again.

44:34.500 --> 44:35.333
Bye.

44:35.833 --> 44:36.666
Bye.

44:41.916 --> 44:43.958
<i>Even if none of us would have admitted it,</i>

44:44.041 --> 44:46.416
<i>we were all deeply scared of sex.</i>

44:48.000 --> 44:50.083
<i>It was a mystery that had to be unveiled.</i>

44:50.166 --> 44:52.500
<i>We were attracted to it</i>
<i>without knowing why.</i>

44:53.666 --> 44:55.500
<i>Some used it to achieve freedom.</i>

44:57.083 --> 44:58.708
<i>Others used it to destroy.</i>

44:59.208 --> 45:02.791
Mom, this is one of my schoolmates.
Stefano Jervi.

45:05.625 --> 45:06.833
Good evening, ma'am.

45:06.916 --> 45:07.958
Bye, Mom.

45:08.041 --> 45:09.375
Didn't you get him a present?

45:09.458 --> 45:11.958
-D'Avenia and I got one together.
-What did you get him?

45:17.500 --> 45:18.333
Benazza!

45:19.208 --> 45:20.208
How's it going?

45:21.625 --> 45:23.291
-What a night!
-Yes.

45:25.333 --> 45:26.750
Can I come with you?

45:26.833 --> 45:28.000
What?

45:28.083 --> 45:29.375
Just this time, please.

45:35.333 --> 45:37.416
-You brought your little brother.
-Do you like me?

45:37.500 --> 45:39.416
Let's get something to drink. Come on.

45:39.500 --> 45:40.333
What's new?

45:40.416 --> 45:41.750
Andrea is out of jail.

45:41.833 --> 45:43.791
Fuck, finally. Where is he?

45:43.875 --> 45:45.208
He stopped by earlier.

45:45.291 --> 45:46.125
He'll be at home.

45:46.208 --> 45:48.333
It was tough, but he held up in there.

45:48.416 --> 45:49.250
-Yes.
-It's not easy.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.583
Now we'll have fun.

45:50.666 --> 45:51.958
Yes, we'll have fun.

45:52.041 --> 45:53.583
Now we have to celebrate.

45:53.666 --> 45:54.750
To Andrea.

45:54.833 --> 45:56.416
To Andrea.

45:56.500 --> 45:57.750
To Andrea.

45:57.833 --> 45:59.666
To Gioacchino!

45:59.750 --> 46:00.708
To Gioacchino!

46:00.791 --> 46:02.666
Happy birthday!

46:02.750 --> 46:04.291
Thank you. Thank you all.

46:04.375 --> 46:07.041
-To Gioacchino!
-Thanks.

46:08.208 --> 46:09.416
I'm fucking fed up now.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.375
To Gioacchino!

46:10.458 --> 46:11.583
To Gioacchino!

46:11.666 --> 46:13.000
To Gioacchino!

46:14.166 --> 46:16.291
-To Gioacchino!
-Happy birthday.

46:18.791 --> 46:20.916
Ready for a special dish?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.125
Spaghetti with clams, sir!

46:23.208 --> 46:25.333
You're a clown, Pik. Stop it.

46:25.416 --> 46:26.958
Would you like some more wine?

46:27.041 --> 46:29.458
Wait, this monsieur needs more wine.

46:29.541 --> 46:30.583
Enough now.

46:30.666 --> 46:32.291
I don't know what it is.

46:32.375 --> 46:35.125
-You've finished. I'll take it.
-Pik, enough with this shit.

46:35.208 --> 46:41.208
Gioacchino!

48:57.041 --> 48:58.208
Hi, Sara.

49:04.041 --> 49:05.041
Who is she?

49:07.041 --> 49:08.375
A girl I know.

49:09.333 --> 49:10.875
And why didn't she say hi?

49:11.708 --> 49:13.541
I don't know. She didn't recognize me.

49:14.833 --> 49:16.250
-Come with me.
-Where?

49:16.333 --> 49:17.666
-Just come.
-But where?

49:17.750 --> 49:19.041
Come with me.

49:19.125 --> 49:20.125
Excuse me.

49:21.041 --> 49:22.083
Excuse me.

49:22.625 --> 49:23.708
Excuse me?

49:23.791 --> 49:25.791
Do you know my brother? Salvatore.

49:26.291 --> 49:27.875
Oh, yeah. Hi.

49:27.958 --> 49:29.791
Is that it? Nothing else?

49:31.750 --> 49:32.916
What do you mean?

49:34.083 --> 49:35.166
He's a nice guy, isn't he?

49:35.250 --> 49:36.625
Get a drink together.

49:38.333 --> 49:39.666
Actually, I have to go home.

49:39.750 --> 49:41.291
You'll go home when I say so.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.458
Do you really like this one?

49:44.916 --> 49:46.125
Where are you going?

49:46.833 --> 49:48.375
Look at me.

49:49.458 --> 49:51.041
Think you're the only one with a pussy?

49:52.458 --> 49:54.250
Think you're too cool for him?

49:56.166 --> 49:57.375
Please, stop.

49:57.458 --> 49:58.583
Now you beg me.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.333
Go.

50:12.375 --> 50:16.041
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

50:16.125 --> 50:18.958
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

50:19.041 --> 50:24.250
Blow!

50:47.166 --> 50:49.041
-Did you see that?
-No. What?

50:49.125 --> 50:51.041
-That was Brother Curzio.
-What? Where?

51:07.416 --> 51:11.500
2 MONTHS BEFORE THE FACTS

51:15.083 --> 51:16.458
Before starting class,

51:16.541 --> 51:19.333
I have your marked essays.

51:20.375 --> 51:21.375
Albinati.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.166
Thanks, Professor.

51:25.250 --> 51:26.458
Arbus.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.083
Your essay is correct. Well written, even.

51:30.166 --> 51:31.250
But it's empty.

51:32.083 --> 51:35.958
There's no passion, no emotion,
no personal interpretation.

51:36.041 --> 51:38.541
I have no personal interpretation

51:39.166 --> 51:41.166
for an essay about literature.

51:41.250 --> 51:43.833
I know you need a B average
to graduate early,

51:43.916 --> 51:46.291
but this essay doesn't deserve
more than a C.

51:50.250 --> 51:51.333
Benazza.

51:57.833 --> 52:01.291
"The greatest man in history

52:02.041 --> 52:04.166
was Adolf Hitler."

52:18.583 --> 52:19.666
Professor.

52:21.083 --> 52:22.916
You're always talking about socialism.

52:23.458 --> 52:24.833
About democracy.

52:25.625 --> 52:29.041
Yet you won't allow an essay
about a historical figure.

52:29.583 --> 52:30.666
Is that democratic?

52:30.750 --> 52:32.375
Democratic?

52:33.250 --> 52:35.791
Why? Was Adolf Hitler democratic?

52:36.416 --> 52:37.500
Sit down.

52:39.250 --> 52:40.125
Quiet.

52:44.083 --> 52:46.291
Try to understand what you read
when you study.

52:47.666 --> 52:49.416
And use your head.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.750
Think about it, Benazza.

52:54.833 --> 52:56.041
Think about it.

53:06.375 --> 53:08.208
Guys. Hi.

53:09.125 --> 53:10.250
Good, you?

53:10.833 --> 53:12.541
I'm off. I'll see you around.

53:16.416 --> 53:17.250
Hi.

53:17.750 --> 53:18.958
Hey, how are you?

53:19.041 --> 53:20.625
-I'm good, you?
-Good.

53:22.833 --> 53:24.166
I'll see you, okay?

53:32.041 --> 53:33.625
Maybe you want to help?

53:33.708 --> 53:35.291
I'm missing a screw.

53:35.916 --> 53:37.000
Oh, a screw…

53:37.833 --> 53:40.416
-Shall I call your dad?
-No, Mom. I'm working on it.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.125
I can see that.

53:42.208 --> 53:44.208
-You seem in trouble, so…
-I seem…

53:44.291 --> 53:47.750
<i>I think destiny is the name of the line</i>
<i>that draws people's lives.</i>

53:50.750 --> 53:53.208
<i>Leda's destiny concerned me deeply.</i>

53:54.750 --> 53:57.250
<i>We feel immensely grateful</i>
<i>to those who inflict pain on us</i>

53:57.333 --> 53:58.333
<i>as soon as they stop.</i>

53:58.833 --> 54:01.291
Go get Dad. So we can make a fire.

54:01.375 --> 54:05.041
<i>This explains why some women</i>
<i>stay with their abusive husbands.</i>

54:05.791 --> 54:08.416
<i>Those moments of respite</i>
<i>make them love their men more,</i>

54:08.500 --> 54:10.083
<i>as they've been so generous</i>

54:10.166 --> 54:12.541
<i>to have temporarily stopped</i>
<i>mistreating them.</i>

54:13.291 --> 54:14.291
Dad?

54:16.166 --> 54:17.166
Dad?

54:21.000 --> 54:22.708
-The food's almost ready.
-Yes.

54:23.458 --> 54:24.750
I'll be right there.

54:53.541 --> 54:55.250
Is everything ready for the fire?

54:57.041 --> 54:58.083
Yes, my love.

55:02.875 --> 55:06.833
70 HOURS BEFORE THE FACTS

55:24.250 --> 55:26.416
-Hi, Donatella.
-Hi.

55:26.958 --> 55:28.333
-Nice to meet you. Gianni.
-Hi.

55:28.416 --> 55:29.583
-Hi.
-Angelo.

55:29.666 --> 55:31.375
Hi. Donatella.

55:31.458 --> 55:33.916
-Nadia?
-Nadia couldn't come, sorry.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.250
She had to take her baby sister
to the fun fair.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.166
I see.

55:38.250 --> 55:39.083
This is Rosaria.

55:39.166 --> 55:40.916
Sorry, I have to make a call.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.291
-Go.
-I'll be right back.

55:42.375 --> 55:43.333
Yes, sure.

55:43.416 --> 55:45.500
What can we get you to drink?

55:46.541 --> 55:47.875
Whatever you get is fine.

55:47.958 --> 55:49.333
Have you been friends long?

55:50.083 --> 55:51.750
More than friends. We're like brothers.

55:51.833 --> 55:54.083
-And you?
-We're neighbors.

55:54.666 --> 55:55.708
Are you from the area?

55:56.583 --> 55:57.416
More or less.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.291
Shall I get you something?

56:00.166 --> 56:02.375
What happened to you?
You left half an hour ago.

56:02.458 --> 56:04.125
I don't want
to hang out with them, Angelo.

56:05.833 --> 56:07.041
I figured it out.

56:07.666 --> 56:09.333
You even said your name was Carlo.

56:10.125 --> 56:12.833
At least play along, okay? Would you mind?

56:14.083 --> 56:15.458
It depends. Where is the film?

56:15.541 --> 56:17.333
Have you got a curfew?

56:17.416 --> 56:19.791
-Are you up for it, Rosa'?
-Well? Are you coming?

56:19.875 --> 56:20.875
Yes.

56:21.875 --> 56:22.916
What?

56:23.416 --> 56:25.916
We were planning
to go to the movies on Monday.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.250
Nadia is coming too, right?

56:28.750 --> 56:29.750
I believe so.

56:31.041 --> 56:32.083
Are you joining us?

56:33.166 --> 56:34.166
Yes, okay.

56:35.166 --> 56:36.166
Perfect.

56:37.875 --> 56:39.000
Are you up for it?

56:39.541 --> 56:40.750
-Of course she is.
-Yes.

56:40.833 --> 56:41.666
Good.

57:00.791 --> 57:01.875
What's happening?

57:03.166 --> 57:04.291
Where's Dad?

57:22.833 --> 57:27.291
LETTER BY PROFESSOR LUDOVICO ARBUS
I'M A HOMOSEXUAL, I CAN NO LONGER LIE

57:27.375 --> 57:28.250
He left.

57:30.333 --> 57:32.375
He's realized that he likes men.

57:32.875 --> 57:34.125
Didn't you know?

58:19.208 --> 58:20.291
Hi.

58:20.375 --> 58:21.208
Hey.

58:21.291 --> 58:22.833
How did you know I live here?

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Did you follow me?

58:29.458 --> 58:31.875
Sorry about the other day.
I was in a rush.

58:31.958 --> 58:33.250
Don't worry.

58:35.291 --> 58:37.416
Do you want to come up? Nobody's home.

58:40.250 --> 58:41.250
Okay.

58:43.875 --> 58:44.875
Let's go.

58:46.208 --> 58:49.291
<i>How nice would it be</i>
<i>not to have a sexuality at all?</i>

58:49.833 --> 58:52.208
<i>Imagine the relief</i>
<i>of not feeling this pressure.</i>

58:52.291 --> 58:55.166
<i>Sometimes, a little negligence</i>
<i>can escalate into great evil.</i>

58:55.250 --> 58:57.125
<i>And the most unfair consequence of sin</i>

58:57.208 --> 59:00.291
<i>is that it contaminates both</i>
<i>the perpetrators and the innocents.</i>

59:00.375 --> 59:01.208
Little finger.

59:01.291 --> 59:02.875
The sun…

59:02.958 --> 59:03.916
-Mom.
-Sweetheart.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.541
Remember when I was a child

59:05.625 --> 59:08.458
and I dreamed of piercing Jesus
with a pitchfork?

59:09.916 --> 59:13.625
-What are you talking about?
-Yes, I woke up all shaken.

59:13.708 --> 59:15.958
He was twitching like a lizard.

59:17.041 --> 59:21.083
No, I don't remember that story,
but it sounds horrible.

59:28.666 --> 59:30.041
Hey!

59:33.208 --> 59:34.416
Get this.

59:36.375 --> 59:38.500
These are for Mom.

59:38.583 --> 59:39.833
Show me.

59:40.708 --> 59:43.208
How lovely! Are they for your painting?

59:43.291 --> 59:44.458
-Yes.
-Beautiful!

59:45.625 --> 59:46.958
Hi!

59:48.166 --> 59:49.041
It's us!

59:50.333 --> 59:53.166
-Wait, we'll help you. Come here.
-Ouch. Stop.

59:53.250 --> 59:54.208
-What is it?
-Jesus!

59:54.291 --> 59:55.500
Mom, don't worry.

59:56.041 --> 59:57.708
-We're here for you.
-Are you okay?

59:57.791 --> 59:58.708
Yes. Stop.

59:58.791 --> 59:59.875
-What happened?
-No.

59:59.958 --> 1:00:02.250
-Ouch!
-Calm down, okay? Come here.

1:00:03.666 --> 1:00:06.375
Giaele?

1:00:16.958 --> 1:00:18.083
What did you do?

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.125
Open your mouth!

1:00:19.208 --> 1:00:20.583
Gioacchino!

1:00:22.083 --> 1:00:23.291
Gioacchino, come!

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.333
What's going on?

1:00:30.291 --> 1:00:31.791
Giaele, spit it.

1:00:31.875 --> 1:00:34.125
-What's going on? What did she do?
-She ate a berry.

1:00:34.208 --> 1:00:35.416
What do you mean, a berry?

1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:36.916
-Come on. Giaele, look at me.
-Spit!

1:00:37.791 --> 1:00:38.875
Please, spit it out.

1:00:38.958 --> 1:00:40.208
Call someone.

1:00:40.291 --> 1:00:41.333
-Spit it.
-Dad!

1:00:41.416 --> 1:00:42.333
I'm here!

1:00:42.416 --> 1:00:44.791
Dad, run, Giaele is sick. Run, Dad!

1:00:44.875 --> 1:00:45.708
Giaele?

1:00:45.791 --> 1:00:47.291
Please, do something!

1:00:47.375 --> 1:00:49.291
Giaele. My love.

1:00:51.916 --> 1:00:53.125
-Ouch!
-Call someone!

1:00:53.208 --> 1:00:54.500
-Okay.
-What's going on?

1:00:54.583 --> 1:00:55.458
Sweetheart.

1:00:55.541 --> 1:00:57.500
Sweetheart, breathe. Breathe.

1:00:57.583 --> 1:00:59.375
-Breathe, sweetheart. Come on.
-Breathe.

1:00:59.458 --> 1:01:00.958
Come on.

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:03.083
Breathe, sweetheart.

1:01:03.958 --> 1:01:05.416
-Giaele.
-Sweetheart?

1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:07.458
Sweetheart!

1:01:07.541 --> 1:01:08.541
Sweetheart?

1:01:08.625 --> 1:01:10.625
Sweetheart, speak to me!

1:01:10.708 --> 1:01:11.916
-Speak to me.
-Sweetheart?

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.291
Speak to me, sweetheart.

1:01:19.166 --> 1:01:20.250
Giaele.

1:01:21.125 --> 1:01:22.208
Giaele?

1:01:24.750 --> 1:01:25.583
Sweetheart…

1:01:25.666 --> 1:01:27.500
Giaele, speak to me.

1:01:27.583 --> 1:01:29.166
Speak to me, sweetheart.

1:01:29.250 --> 1:01:32.416
Speak to me, sweetheart.

1:01:32.500 --> 1:01:34.375
Speak to me…

1:01:37.375 --> 1:01:41.125
Sweetheart, no!

1:01:44.541 --> 1:01:45.708
Giaele.

1:01:49.583 --> 1:01:52.500
Why?

1:01:53.125 --> 1:01:55.458
I was here!

1:01:56.208 --> 1:01:57.333
Sweetheart.

1:01:57.875 --> 1:01:58.708
Speak to me.

1:02:06.083 --> 1:02:07.791
Good morning, Brother Curzio.

1:02:07.875 --> 1:02:08.875
Hey, Albinati.

1:02:09.416 --> 1:02:10.666
It went well, didn't it?

1:02:10.750 --> 1:02:12.291
You passed with distinction.

1:02:12.791 --> 1:02:14.375
Thanks. See you next year.

1:02:15.291 --> 1:02:16.291
I don't think so.

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.708
<i>After the death of his little sister,</i>

1:02:21.791 --> 1:02:24.083
<i>many things changed</i>
<i>in Gioacchino's family.</i>

1:02:26.166 --> 1:02:27.916
<i>I met him again years later.</i>

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.083
<i>He had become a psychiatrist</i>

1:02:29.166 --> 1:02:31.625
<i>and had treated Benazza,</i>
<i>who then killed himself.</i>

1:02:32.166 --> 1:02:34.541
<i>His diagnoses</i>
<i>of our old schoolmates were ruthless,</i>

1:02:34.625 --> 1:02:36.666
<i>and confirmed their tendencies.</i>

1:02:37.375 --> 1:02:39.958
<i>Chiodi was a sadist. D'Avenia a masochist.</i>

1:02:40.750 --> 1:02:42.208
<i>Then he told me about Jervi.</i>

1:02:42.791 --> 1:02:44.000
<i>He had died.</i>

1:02:44.083 --> 1:02:47.166
<i>He had blown himself up</i>
<i>while preparing a terrorist attack.</i>

1:02:56.416 --> 1:02:57.750
What's up, Salvatore?

1:02:57.833 --> 1:02:59.791
Why so deep in thought?

1:02:59.875 --> 1:03:00.875
You passed.

1:03:00.958 --> 1:03:02.208
He must be in love.

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:04.458
I'm not in love.

1:03:09.791 --> 1:03:11.000
I'm off.

1:03:11.083 --> 1:03:11.958
Where to?

1:03:12.041 --> 1:03:14.583
To a party.
And yes, Mom, I'll be back early.

1:03:37.875 --> 1:03:39.708
Hey! Weren't you going to a party too?

1:03:39.791 --> 1:03:41.333
-Yeah.
-Hurry up, then.

1:03:41.416 --> 1:03:42.416
I'm going now.

1:03:50.833 --> 1:03:56.916
36 HOURS BEFORE THE FACTS

1:04:05.583 --> 1:04:07.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.708
-Hi.
-Just the two of you?

1:04:10.958 --> 1:04:12.041
Nadia couldn't come.

1:04:12.125 --> 1:04:13.500
Better. At least we're even.

1:04:13.583 --> 1:04:14.541
And Carlo?

1:04:14.625 --> 1:04:15.791
He had to study.

1:04:17.125 --> 1:04:19.708
But he said
we can join him at his mansion.

1:04:19.791 --> 1:04:21.208
-A mansion?
-Yes, by the sea.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:22.166
Where?

1:04:22.708 --> 1:04:24.250
In a beautiful place, for real.

1:04:26.083 --> 1:04:28.958
-What do you think?
-I don't know. I can't be home late.

1:04:29.458 --> 1:04:32.083
It's not far. Don't worry.
It'll take us an hour, tops.

1:04:32.166 --> 1:04:33.833
I have to be home for dinner, so…

1:04:33.916 --> 1:04:36.791
Yeah, but it's one hour to go,
one hour to come back. Then…

1:04:36.875 --> 1:04:38.500
Shall we go to the movies?

1:04:39.916 --> 1:04:42.333
It's something different.
We can watch the sunset.

1:04:42.416 --> 1:04:43.541
-What do you say?
-Come on.

1:04:44.750 --> 1:04:46.375
-Okay, fine.
-Come on.

1:04:46.875 --> 1:04:48.416
-But let's not be late.
-Yes.

1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:49.541
Don't worry.

1:04:54.541 --> 1:04:56.458
-Thank you. There you go.
-Please.

1:04:56.541 --> 1:04:57.500
-Okay.
-Thanks.

1:05:15.833 --> 1:05:16.750
Hi, Leda.

1:05:17.583 --> 1:05:18.958
Is your brother here?

1:05:19.041 --> 1:05:21.000
No, no one's at home. I'm alone.

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:24.000
When will he be back?
I wanted to congratulate him on his exam.

1:05:25.625 --> 1:05:27.916
Two years in one.
No one's ever pulled that off.

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:30.041
You can wait here if you like.

1:05:32.083 --> 1:05:33.083
Lie down.

1:06:48.916 --> 1:06:51.583
<i>I had often dreamed</i>
<i>of being alone with her.</i>

1:06:52.458 --> 1:06:54.041
<i>And suddenly, it happened.</i>

1:06:56.625 --> 1:06:58.000
<i>It was a bit weird.</i>

1:06:59.083 --> 1:07:01.000
<i>I had this tender and ridiculous feeling</i>

1:07:01.083 --> 1:07:03.500
<i>which from that day</i>
<i>characterized all my love stories,</i>

1:07:03.583 --> 1:07:05.875
<i>always a bit absurd and unfinished.</i>

1:07:06.791 --> 1:07:09.333
<i>Then again, maybe that's why</i>
<i>I remember them so well.</i>

1:07:11.291 --> 1:07:12.125
Edo.

1:07:12.208 --> 1:07:13.083
Hey.

1:07:14.333 --> 1:07:16.666
-What's that?
An invitation to a party at Circeo.

1:07:18.333 --> 1:07:20.291
<i>That's the last time I saw Leda.</i>

1:07:21.750 --> 1:07:22.750
Hi.

1:07:23.958 --> 1:07:25.625
There he is. I'll go say hi.

1:07:34.041 --> 1:07:35.458
Leda, what's happened?

1:07:36.875 --> 1:07:38.833
-Can I do anything?
-Don't get involved.

1:07:40.541 --> 1:07:42.583
Look at you. You're a child.

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.333
Carlo must have gone for a swim.
Come with me.

1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:17.375
Please.

1:08:18.166 --> 1:08:20.375
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:08:26.708 --> 1:08:29.500
Wait. I'll just park the car. One second.

1:08:50.583 --> 1:08:51.750
Gosh.

1:08:53.833 --> 1:08:55.666
I've never seen a house like this.

1:09:00.833 --> 1:09:02.291
Hello, good morning.

1:09:02.375 --> 1:09:03.875
May I speak to Monica?

1:09:03.958 --> 1:09:05.000
<i>Speaking.</i>

1:09:05.083 --> 1:09:05.958
Good morning, miss.

1:09:06.041 --> 1:09:07.750
This is Dr. Edoardo Albinati's assistant.

1:09:07.833 --> 1:09:09.333
You know who I'm talking about?

1:09:09.416 --> 1:09:12.291
Mr. Albinati would like
to invite you to a party at Circeo.

1:09:12.375 --> 1:09:15.000
He thought it would be a nice idea,
since you first met there.

1:09:15.083 --> 1:09:16.750
Can you confirm?

1:09:16.833 --> 1:09:18.875
<i>-But is Edoardo there?</i>
-Say yes.

1:09:18.958 --> 1:09:20.541
Yes. I'll put him on now.

1:09:20.625 --> 1:09:23.750
We are now forwarding your call
to Mr. Edoardo Albinati.

1:09:26.250 --> 1:09:27.250
Hi, Monica.

1:09:27.333 --> 1:09:28.333
<i>Who was that?</i>

1:09:28.416 --> 1:09:29.833
A friend of mine.

1:09:29.916 --> 1:09:31.208
<i>Funny guy.</i>

1:09:31.291 --> 1:09:32.791
Well, at least it worked.

1:09:32.875 --> 1:09:33.708
<i>How so?</i>

1:09:34.208 --> 1:09:37.083
Well, you and I
are going on a date, aren't we?

1:09:37.916 --> 1:09:39.666
I'm here with my assistant.

1:09:40.833 --> 1:09:42.458
<i>Okay. What's the plan?</i>

1:09:42.541 --> 1:09:45.083
-Shall we come pick you up in an hour?
-Yes.

1:09:46.416 --> 1:09:48.416
-You definitely have your car?
-Of course.

1:09:48.500 --> 1:09:49.458
Pik…

1:09:50.416 --> 1:09:51.333
Pik.

1:09:51.416 --> 1:09:53.125
Please, behave.

1:09:53.708 --> 1:09:55.333
-Yes, sorry.
-No bullshit.

1:11:19.708 --> 1:11:20.958
We're early.

1:11:21.041 --> 1:11:23.583
Why don't we go to my house
before heading to the party?

1:11:53.125 --> 1:11:54.708
This house is amazing.

1:11:54.791 --> 1:11:55.625
Yeah.

1:11:56.791 --> 1:11:57.875
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:03.875
-Cheers.
-To you.

1:12:11.541 --> 1:12:13.500
You're really amazing.

1:12:22.416 --> 1:12:23.666
I'm not thinking straight.

1:12:33.458 --> 1:12:34.541
Edo?

1:12:40.750 --> 1:12:43.333
I've never been with a girl.

1:12:45.333 --> 1:12:46.708
Have you seen Erika?

1:12:47.875 --> 1:12:49.875
How she looks at me? How she touches me?

1:12:49.958 --> 1:12:51.250
Please.

1:12:51.333 --> 1:12:52.750
Don't touch me.

1:12:52.833 --> 1:12:55.041
-She thinks you're funny.
-Come on.

1:12:55.541 --> 1:12:56.958
-Yeah? Is that it?
-Yes.

1:12:57.041 --> 1:12:58.375
Come on, Pik, please.

1:12:58.458 --> 1:13:00.041
-You're annoying.
-And then?

1:13:00.125 --> 1:13:01.000
That's it.

1:13:01.083 --> 1:13:02.875
That's more than enough.

1:13:02.958 --> 1:13:04.291
Is that more than enough?

1:13:05.083 --> 1:13:06.208
Don't kid me.

1:13:06.916 --> 1:13:08.166
I know there's more.

1:13:08.250 --> 1:13:09.833
-Come on.
-There's nothing more.

1:13:09.916 --> 1:13:11.625
Chill out, please.

1:13:13.125 --> 1:13:15.000
-What shall I do?
-Don't do anything.

1:13:15.958 --> 1:13:17.333
Nothing, Pik, okay?

1:13:18.166 --> 1:13:19.583
Don't do anything.

1:13:27.750 --> 1:13:29.291
We'll see.

1:13:31.333 --> 1:13:32.666
What do we do now?

1:13:35.208 --> 1:13:36.208
Come on.

1:13:37.125 --> 1:13:38.166
Come on.

1:14:06.041 --> 1:14:08.083
Wait, not like that. Wait.

1:14:09.166 --> 1:14:10.208
Wait.

1:14:13.416 --> 1:14:14.416
Monica.

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:19.500
You are completely crazy.

1:14:21.333 --> 1:14:22.458
It's time to go.

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:24.833
What's happened?

1:14:25.708 --> 1:14:26.708
I have to go home.

1:14:27.333 --> 1:14:29.458
I couldn't do it. I want to go home.

1:14:29.541 --> 1:14:31.250
Pik! Where are you going?

1:14:36.208 --> 1:14:37.416
I'm sorry.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.125
<i>That summer, we understood</i>
<i>that we couldn't erase our mistakes,</i>

1:14:42.208 --> 1:14:45.333
<i>because they were embedded in our school,</i>
<i>inside our homes.</i>

1:14:46.416 --> 1:14:49.000
<i>They were right before our eyes,</i>
<i>but no one could see them.</i>

1:14:49.083 --> 1:14:50.791
<i>No one had the courage to talk about it.</i>

1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:55.333
<i>We had a mask of innocence</i>
<i>stitched on our faces.</i>

1:14:56.041 --> 1:14:57.333
<i>But, suddenly, at that time,</i>

1:14:57.416 --> 1:15:00.250
<i>there was no distinction</i>
<i>between a bunch of reckless kids</i>

1:15:00.333 --> 1:15:01.458
<i>and ferocious murderers.</i>

1:15:01.541 --> 1:15:02.625
It's getting late.

1:15:04.583 --> 1:15:07.083
Sorry, when is Carlo coming?

1:15:07.166 --> 1:15:08.375
Are you not having fun?

1:15:08.458 --> 1:15:11.458
-Yes, but we should be heading home soon.
-Yeah.

1:15:17.458 --> 1:15:18.708
For now, you're staying.

1:15:20.916 --> 1:15:22.625
What, are you playing now?

1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.708
What's going on?

1:15:27.291 --> 1:15:28.958
-Come with me.
-No.

1:15:29.041 --> 1:15:30.375
-Come with me!
-Go.

1:15:31.458 --> 1:15:32.416
Come on.

1:15:33.250 --> 1:15:34.166
Up the stairs!

1:15:37.083 --> 1:15:38.791
-You dirty…
-In the toilet!

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.000
What do you want from us?

1:15:48.916 --> 1:15:50.083
Get off me!

1:15:52.250 --> 1:15:53.833
If you scream, I'll beat you up.

1:15:57.291 --> 1:15:58.208
Open up!

1:15:59.041 --> 1:16:00.791
Open up, please!

1:16:04.541 --> 1:16:05.666
I have to go home.

1:16:06.291 --> 1:16:07.666
Come back soon, okay?

1:16:10.875 --> 1:16:12.666
Remember to call my parents.

1:16:12.750 --> 1:16:13.750
Open up!

1:16:16.375 --> 1:16:19.208
Open up!

1:16:19.291 --> 1:16:21.541
-I want to go home!
-Let us go, please.

1:16:21.625 --> 1:16:22.458
I want to--

1:17:06.750 --> 1:17:08.375
I'm sorry about the other night.

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:10.125
About my brother.

1:17:11.541 --> 1:17:13.625
I just wanted to apologize.

1:18:06.500 --> 1:18:09.166
Sorry, I got a flat tire.
I had no way of letting you know.

1:18:10.708 --> 1:18:11.666
Sit down.

1:18:12.333 --> 1:18:13.916
Can I make a call?

1:18:15.333 --> 1:18:17.041
-Make it quick.
-Thanks.

1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:30.125
Hello, ma'am, Guido speaking.

1:18:30.208 --> 1:18:32.375
Listen, I wanted to tell you

1:18:32.458 --> 1:18:35.083
that Angelo asked me to tell you
that he won't be home tonight.

1:18:35.166 --> 1:18:37.166
The other entrepreneurs aren't stupid.

1:18:37.875 --> 1:18:39.458
Yes, he's with Gianluca, yes.

1:18:40.041 --> 1:18:42.583
They're going to the American flea market
tomorrow morning.

1:18:44.333 --> 1:18:45.500
Thanks. Bye.

1:18:52.250 --> 1:18:54.791
But in the long run,
it could turn out to be a boomerang.

1:18:55.375 --> 1:18:56.375
For the country.

1:18:56.458 --> 1:18:58.333
It's the safest way to invest.

1:18:58.416 --> 1:19:00.291
Sure, interest rates are low, but…

1:19:01.208 --> 1:19:02.833
I know. I do know.

1:19:04.416 --> 1:19:06.083
Then tell him. Convince him.

1:19:07.541 --> 1:19:09.083
It's for our children too.

1:19:10.875 --> 1:19:12.250
It's their money too.

1:19:13.708 --> 1:19:14.541
Sure.

1:19:16.541 --> 1:19:17.541
What's wrong?

1:19:18.291 --> 1:19:19.250
Aren't you hungry?

1:20:15.250 --> 1:20:16.500
Where are you taking me?

1:20:17.250 --> 1:20:18.333
Donatella!

1:21:03.375 --> 1:21:04.208
Your turn.

1:21:07.416 --> 1:21:09.250
Come on. Come.

1:21:11.291 --> 1:21:12.291
Come on!

1:21:13.833 --> 1:21:15.208
Yes. Good girl.

1:21:15.833 --> 1:21:17.833
Come on. Don't be afraid.

1:21:50.916 --> 1:21:51.875
Strip.

1:21:53.375 --> 1:21:54.500
Come on.

1:21:54.583 --> 1:21:55.791
Strip.

1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:58.041
Good girl.

1:22:06.125 --> 1:22:07.333
Then will you let us go?

1:22:07.416 --> 1:22:08.416
Yes, of course.

1:22:13.208 --> 1:22:15.208
We've never been home so late.

1:22:16.208 --> 1:22:18.125
What are we going to tell our parents?

1:22:20.958 --> 1:22:21.916
Hurry up.

1:22:25.708 --> 1:22:28.083
Please, take us home,
or they'll be worried.

1:22:28.166 --> 1:22:29.166
Come on.

1:22:33.750 --> 1:22:35.208
We won't say anything.

1:22:35.750 --> 1:22:36.875
Everything off.

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.083
No, please.

1:22:42.083 --> 1:22:43.125
I beg you.

1:22:45.458 --> 1:22:47.125
Come on. Then we'll see.

1:23:30.250 --> 1:23:31.291
Donatella.

1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:33.666
Did you hear that?

1:23:33.750 --> 1:23:35.333
-What?
-There's a car.

1:23:36.083 --> 1:23:37.458
Help!

1:23:37.541 --> 1:23:39.958
-We've been locked up!
-Open up!

1:23:40.041 --> 1:23:40.916
Help, please!

1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:44.791
Help!

1:23:44.875 --> 1:23:46.291
-Please, help us!
-Help!

1:23:46.375 --> 1:23:47.750
-Help us!
-Open up!

1:23:47.833 --> 1:23:49.041
Help!

1:23:52.583 --> 1:23:53.833
What the fuck are you doing?

1:23:54.583 --> 1:23:55.708
I'll beat you up!

1:23:55.791 --> 1:23:57.416
-Got it?
-Okay!

1:23:58.000 --> 1:23:59.625
We kept Bulgari locked up here.

1:23:59.708 --> 1:24:01.208
You think we'd let you screw us?

1:24:01.291 --> 1:24:02.125
-No!
-Stop it!

1:24:02.208 --> 1:24:03.166
Shut up!

1:24:03.250 --> 1:24:04.583
Jacques will be here soon.

1:24:05.708 --> 1:24:07.750
The Marsigliesi boss.
He told us to kidnap you.

1:24:07.833 --> 1:24:09.416
-This is his place.
-Stop it!

1:24:12.750 --> 1:24:13.833
Come on.

1:24:22.916 --> 1:24:24.375
I want to go home.

1:24:25.666 --> 1:24:26.958
I want to go home.

1:24:27.041 --> 1:24:28.875
Fuck, I'm done with these two.

1:24:28.958 --> 1:24:30.250
I'll go get Andrea.

1:25:08.625 --> 1:25:09.625
This is Jacques.

1:25:10.958 --> 1:25:11.791
Hi.

1:25:13.916 --> 1:25:14.958
Hey, say hi.

1:25:15.041 --> 1:25:15.958
Angelo!

1:25:16.875 --> 1:25:19.125
You shouldn't beat her like that.

1:25:20.875 --> 1:25:21.875
Right?

1:25:23.166 --> 1:25:24.208
Hey.

1:25:25.708 --> 1:25:26.708
Hi.

1:25:30.666 --> 1:25:32.541
Jacques, don't force me to sleep with you.

1:25:32.625 --> 1:25:34.250
We can't take it anymore.

1:25:36.625 --> 1:25:37.750
Don't worry.

1:25:38.583 --> 1:25:40.541
If you don't want to, I won't force you.

1:25:44.416 --> 1:25:45.583
Take us back home.

1:25:46.333 --> 1:25:47.541
Please.

1:25:51.083 --> 1:25:52.041
Please.

1:25:54.708 --> 1:25:56.791
We'll find a way to get you home, okay?

1:25:58.791 --> 1:25:59.916
Okay?

1:26:01.250 --> 1:26:04.250
As long as you don't tell anyone
about what happened here.

1:26:05.291 --> 1:26:06.125
Yes?

1:26:06.791 --> 1:26:08.083
Yes?

1:26:08.166 --> 1:26:09.500
-Is that clear?
-I swear.

1:26:09.583 --> 1:26:10.583
Good.

1:26:12.791 --> 1:26:13.791
And you?

1:26:16.375 --> 1:26:17.208
Hey.

1:26:17.791 --> 1:26:20.416
Wanna come with me?
Come on, don't be afraid.

1:26:29.958 --> 1:26:30.958
Come on.

1:26:34.125 --> 1:26:35.125
Come on.

1:26:36.625 --> 1:26:38.583
Let's go.

1:26:50.708 --> 1:26:51.833
No, please.

1:26:51.916 --> 1:26:53.708
No, don't worry.

1:26:54.791 --> 1:26:55.916
Let me go, please.

1:26:58.333 --> 1:26:59.291
No.

1:27:18.166 --> 1:27:19.375
What is it?

1:27:19.458 --> 1:27:20.875
It'll put you to sleep.

1:27:20.958 --> 1:27:22.166
No. Please, no.

1:27:22.250 --> 1:27:24.500
-Please.
-Don't move. You'll make it worse.

1:27:24.583 --> 1:27:25.416
Don't move.

1:27:30.375 --> 1:27:31.583
Was that so difficult?

1:27:34.458 --> 1:27:36.416
These two are useless now.

1:27:37.208 --> 1:27:39.291
They've always been useless.

1:27:39.375 --> 1:27:40.625
That's not true.

1:27:41.958 --> 1:27:43.208
I don't even fancy them.

1:27:43.708 --> 1:27:44.958
Who, these two?

1:27:48.208 --> 1:27:50.416
This stuff doesn't work.
She's not passing out.

1:27:50.916 --> 1:27:52.916
-Have you tried with the pillow?
-No.

1:27:53.708 --> 1:27:55.375
I have this. What do you think?

1:27:57.333 --> 1:27:58.583
-Come on, now.
-No.

1:27:58.666 --> 1:28:00.041
Move!

1:28:30.208 --> 1:28:31.833
What are they doing to her?

1:28:31.916 --> 1:28:33.541
Do something, please.

1:28:35.833 --> 1:28:36.958
Please.

1:28:40.083 --> 1:28:41.750
-Shall I go?
-Yes, you go.

1:28:43.291 --> 1:28:45.750
-Give me your arm.
-Stop.

1:28:45.833 --> 1:28:47.416
-Here we go.
-Stop.

1:29:10.458 --> 1:29:12.250
Look what your friend did to me.

1:29:12.333 --> 1:29:14.000
Here. And here.

1:29:18.958 --> 1:29:20.166
That's enough.

1:29:20.708 --> 1:29:23.875
If you can't fall asleep,
I'll have to use a karate move.

1:29:24.666 --> 1:29:25.791
No, please.

1:29:27.666 --> 1:29:29.041
Yes, actually.

1:29:29.750 --> 1:29:31.916
I'm all out of patience with you.

1:29:34.583 --> 1:29:36.666
Tell me if you prefer a karate move

1:29:36.750 --> 1:29:39.208
or a blow with the gun's grip
behind your head.

1:29:42.958 --> 1:29:45.541
Do you prefer a karate move

1:29:45.625 --> 1:29:48.541
or a blow with the gun's grip
behind your head?

1:29:51.250 --> 1:29:52.416
A karate move.

1:29:53.791 --> 1:29:55.166
A karate move.

1:29:55.250 --> 1:29:57.625
A karate move!

1:31:03.875 --> 1:31:04.833
Hello?

1:31:04.916 --> 1:31:06.458
-They're killing me.
-Bitch!

1:31:06.541 --> 1:31:08.250
Please!

1:31:11.375 --> 1:31:13.333
You don't get it!

1:31:21.333 --> 1:31:23.333
Can we put them in the trunk?

1:31:23.916 --> 1:31:24.916
Okay.

1:31:25.958 --> 1:31:27.041
Come on, then.

1:31:29.083 --> 1:31:30.708
You have to use a blanket.

1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:03.000
This one took her time to die.

1:32:28.625 --> 1:32:29.541
Andrea.

1:32:30.125 --> 1:32:32.041
I told you not to call me that.

1:32:42.083 --> 1:32:43.791
What are we going to do with them?

1:32:44.333 --> 1:32:45.416
I don't know.

1:32:46.166 --> 1:32:49.041
You deal with them.
I have to take care of the house.

1:32:51.833 --> 1:32:52.958
I'll make a call.

1:32:53.541 --> 1:32:55.791
I'll ask Gianluca to tell our parents.

1:33:00.166 --> 1:33:02.291
Look how well they're sleeping.

1:33:14.416 --> 1:33:16.791
<i>Yes, I get it, Gianluca,</i>
<i>but where is my son?</i>

1:33:18.583 --> 1:33:19.500
At Angelo's?

1:33:20.041 --> 1:33:22.250
He said he was going to Maurizio's place.

1:33:24.333 --> 1:33:25.750
At the last minute.

1:33:26.666 --> 1:33:27.958
Yes, yes, that's fine.

1:33:28.041 --> 1:33:29.041
Thanks.

1:33:35.500 --> 1:33:36.416
Who was that?

1:33:37.166 --> 1:33:38.208
Gianluca.

1:33:38.833 --> 1:33:40.750
They're coming back. Everything is okay.

1:33:40.833 --> 1:33:42.458
I told you, didn't I?

1:33:54.708 --> 1:33:57.666
They were pieces of meat,
and they still are pieces of meat.

1:34:02.791 --> 1:34:05.208
Only our friendship can save us.

1:34:06.250 --> 1:34:08.291
Only our brotherhood.

1:34:11.458 --> 1:34:14.541
Friends of death, friends in death.

1:34:15.541 --> 1:34:19.166
Friends of death, friends in death.

1:34:19.250 --> 1:34:23.666
Friends of death, friends in death! Fuck.

1:34:26.166 --> 1:34:27.833
What time are the others coming?

1:34:27.916 --> 1:34:28.750
In an hour.

1:34:28.833 --> 1:34:30.375
Let's have pizza.

1:34:30.458 --> 1:34:32.000
I can't. I gotta go home.

1:34:32.083 --> 1:34:35.125
Home? What am I supposed to do
here alone for an hour?

1:34:35.208 --> 1:34:37.583
No idea, Angelo.
I'm gonna see you later anyway.

1:34:38.125 --> 1:34:40.125
We can do it when no one sees us.

1:34:50.208 --> 1:34:51.583
Okay, but what time?

1:34:52.208 --> 1:34:53.708
At three. Okay?

1:34:55.750 --> 1:34:56.583
Angelo, here.

1:34:56.666 --> 1:34:58.583
These are the keys to the car

1:34:58.666 --> 1:34:59.791
and to the gate.

1:34:59.875 --> 1:35:02.208
So you can get in
without making any noise. Okay?

1:35:02.708 --> 1:35:03.833
I'll see you later.

1:36:01.458 --> 1:36:02.458
Rosa'.

1:36:06.958 --> 1:36:07.958
Rosaria.

1:36:11.166 --> 1:36:12.458
They've left.

1:36:16.458 --> 1:36:17.458
Rosaria.

1:36:23.250 --> 1:36:24.416
They've left.

1:36:25.625 --> 1:36:26.625
Rosaria.

1:36:28.750 --> 1:36:29.875
They've left.

1:36:32.875 --> 1:36:33.833
Rosaria.

1:36:35.291 --> 1:36:36.375
Wake up.

1:36:36.916 --> 1:36:38.166
Wake up, please.

1:37:18.291 --> 1:37:19.875
Please. Rosa'.

1:37:19.958 --> 1:37:21.083
Please.

1:37:25.583 --> 1:37:28.083
Help. I'm here.

1:37:29.125 --> 1:37:30.250
We're here.

1:37:30.333 --> 1:37:31.708
Please, open up.

1:37:31.791 --> 1:37:34.000
Otherwise, they'll be back. Please.

1:37:41.583 --> 1:37:43.166
Good evening. What's the matter?

1:37:43.250 --> 1:37:46.583
According to our records,
you're the owner of a white Fiat 127.

1:37:46.666 --> 1:37:47.750
Is it stolen?

1:37:47.833 --> 1:37:49.708
No, it's parked nearby.

1:37:49.791 --> 1:37:51.166
Are you the only one using it?

1:37:51.708 --> 1:37:53.291
No, my son uses it too. Why?

1:37:53.375 --> 1:37:55.875
-And where is he now?
-Asleep in his room.

1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.833
Sir, we have to check.

1:37:58.916 --> 1:37:59.916
Just a second.

1:38:01.541 --> 1:38:02.791
Raffaele, what's going on?

1:38:02.875 --> 1:38:04.125
Go to bed.

1:39:01.416 --> 1:39:06.791
<i>I confess to Almighty God</i>
<i>and to you, my brothers and sisters,</i>

1:39:08.666 --> 1:39:10.291
<i>that I have greatly sinned</i>

1:39:12.333 --> 1:39:16.291
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done

1:39:17.416 --> 1:39:18.958
and in what I have failed to do.

1:39:20.541 --> 1:39:22.958
God Almighty, have mercy on us.

1:39:23.041 --> 1:39:25.166
Forgive our sins.

1:39:26.166 --> 1:39:29.875
<i>After these events,</i>
<i>some people suddenly reacted.</i>

1:39:31.791 --> 1:39:34.000
<i>It was as if the resentment</i>
<i>we all carried inside</i>

1:39:34.083 --> 1:39:36.250
<i>was looking for a way to emerge.</i>

1:39:38.458 --> 1:39:42.833
Jesus, who came to console the sinners…

1:39:42.916 --> 1:39:45.041
<i>I never went back to that high school.</i>

1:39:46.541 --> 1:39:47.916
<i>The last year, I left.</i>

1:39:49.625 --> 1:39:51.958
<i>After the murder,</i>
<i>our quiet neighborhood had changed.</i>

1:39:52.041 --> 1:39:54.416
<i>People in the street were suspicious.</i>

1:39:55.791 --> 1:39:57.750
<i>No one felt safe anymore.</i>

1:40:01.416 --> 1:40:05.833
SCIENCE ENLIGHTENS THE MIND

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.041
<i>At home, every mother</i>
<i>scrutinized her child,</i>

1:40:09.125 --> 1:40:11.875
<i>trying to detect</i>
<i>if a monster was lurking in there too.</i>

1:40:15.833 --> 1:40:17.166
<i>This went on for a while.</i>

1:40:17.250 --> 1:40:18.416
<i>Everyone started to realize</i>

1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:20.458
<i>that if you sweep the dust</i>
<i>under the carpet,</i>

1:40:20.541 --> 1:40:22.000
<i>eventually a mountain piles up.</i>

1:40:25.250 --> 1:40:26.375
<i>Then, gradually,</i>

1:40:27.333 --> 1:40:29.291
<i>things went back to how they were before.</i>

1:41:14.791 --> 1:41:16.291
At the time of the Circeo Massacre,

1:41:16.375 --> 1:41:18.916
rape was not considered a crime
against the person,

1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:20.500
but against public morality.

1:41:20.583 --> 1:41:23.125
Rosaria Lopez’s death
and Donatella Colasanti’s torture

1:41:23.208 --> 1:41:26.083
ignited a debate that only concluded
in 1996, when Italian law was changed

1:41:26.166 --> 1:41:29.000
and sexual violence was finally considered
a crime against the person.

1:41:29.083 --> 1:41:33.208
The three perpetrators of the massacre
were all given life sentences.

1:41:33.708 --> 1:41:34.833
Angelo Izzo

1:41:34.916 --> 1:41:37.958
As soon as he was released on parole
for good conduct in 2005

1:41:38.041 --> 1:41:39.458
he killed two more women.

1:41:39.541 --> 1:41:40.416
Andrea Ghira

1:41:40.500 --> 1:41:42.958
died in Morocco in 1994
after eluding arrest

1:41:43.041 --> 1:41:45.416
and having lived all his life
as a fugitive.

1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:46.416
Gianni Guido

1:41:46.500 --> 1:41:50.333
Thanks to a sentence reduction,
he has been free since 2009.

1:41:52.458 --> 1:41:57.000
Donatella Colasanti passed away in 2005
at the age of just 47.

1:45:56.416 --> 1:46:00.541
