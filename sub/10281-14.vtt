WEBVTT

00:04.772 --> 00:05.806
Previously on ER:

00:05.839 --> 00:07.308
I need a mat.
Well, get used to it.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.543
You'll be sliding the hall
in socks in no time.

00:09.577 --> 00:10.711
How long are you
going to stay?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.413
Kem's going to go back

00:12.446 --> 00:14.482
and see her family
for a couple weeks, and then...

00:14.515 --> 00:16.149
come back here
and have the baby.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.387
I don't want you
to get the wrong
idea about Luka.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.688
He's a good guy.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.556
I'm not looking for anything
right now.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.093
Okay. I just thought
you should know.

00:25.126 --> 00:29.097
Thank you, but independence
works pretty good for me...

00:29.130 --> 00:32.266
although I wouldn't mind
some regular sex.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.438
They always pray
before they start eating.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.573
You have to bow your head
and stuff. It's weird.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.109
Just be respectful.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.176
Think about
something else.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.444
Like what?

00:43.477 --> 00:45.713
I don't know,
baseball, dinosaurs...

00:45.746 --> 00:48.149
cannibalism.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.718
Isn't his mom going
to set something
on fire tonight?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.120
Bananas.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.587
That doesn't
happen every day.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.157
Well, Austin's mom can cook
pretty much anything.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.159
See? You're going to have
a great time.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.261
Sorry, late start.
Hi, Austin.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.595
I couldn't get
Max going either.

01:01.629 --> 01:04.831
I'm never going
to make yoga now.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.467
Okay.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.403
It's one for my pager,
two for the hospital, okay?

01:09.437 --> 01:11.139
What're you going
to do tonight?

01:11.172 --> 01:13.141
I don't know. Remember to check
your sugar before bed.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.808
You going to see Luka?

01:14.842 --> 01:16.744
Uh, I don't know.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.746
I guess. Bye.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.148
Enjoy your night
of freedom.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.316
Thanks, I will.

01:23.217 --> 01:27.355
Man, your sister's hot.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.789
14-year-old female,
ankle inversion

01:28.822 --> 01:30.758
stepping off a curb,
I'm dying!

01:30.791 --> 01:33.161
probable second
degree sprain.
I'm dying right now,

01:33.161 --> 01:35.229
every second, dying!
Every day,

01:35.263 --> 01:36.797
I'm closer to death!

01:36.830 --> 01:39.333
( all talking )

01:39.367 --> 01:42.203
73-year-old male.
Hold on.
Past medical history?

01:42.236 --> 01:44.205
On the 14-year-old?
Unremarkable.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.640
Was she drunk or high?
Does the story match the injury?

01:46.674 --> 01:47.775
Is she sexually active?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.310
When was her last
menstrual period?

01:49.343 --> 01:50.544
She came in for
a sprained ankle.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.346
Abby, monoarticular joint pain

01:52.380 --> 01:54.182
in a young woman
could be the result

01:54.182 --> 01:56.217
of gonococcal arthritis,
staph,

01:56.250 --> 01:58.652
or a systemic
polyarticular disease.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.388
Or she fell off a curb.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.223
You're a med student.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.392
I don't want to hear
"history unremarkable."

02:04.425 --> 02:05.926
This ER visit
may be the only time

02:05.959 --> 02:07.861
a 14-year-old sees
a doctor.
Dr. Weaver?

02:07.895 --> 02:10.564
Get a sexual history.
Do some STD counseling.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.434
Dr. Weaver, Arnie Nadler,
Human Resources.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.769
Oh, right.
Hi. Arnie Nadler.
Nice to meet you.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.372
Mr. Nadler is visiting us
for a couple of weeks,

02:18.406 --> 02:21.209
advising us on how
to have a happy and
cooperative workplace.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.744
Ah. Shorter hours,
higher pay.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.579
Pardon?
Just a suggestion.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.847
I'm very open
to suggestions.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.582
I'll be interviewing
the entire staff

02:28.616 --> 02:30.318
before issuing
my recommendations,

02:30.351 --> 02:32.753
and I would love to pursue
this conversation with you

02:32.786 --> 02:34.255
when you have
a free minute.
Great.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.589
An HR consultant?

02:35.623 --> 02:37.658
Risk management
sent him.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.428
He's a mandated part
of the Romano lawsuit.
Arnie Nadler. Hi.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.962
Which one?
Hengstet.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.598
Who?
Nurse with the weird
little dog and that hat.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.267
Oh, sexual harassment?

02:46.300 --> 02:48.802
Hostile work
environment.

02:48.836 --> 02:52.273
We identify and assess
high-risk employee behaviors

02:52.306 --> 02:54.608
and implement unique
early-intervention strategies

02:54.642 --> 02:58.479
before they escalate into
psychological abuse or violence.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.748
Have you ever been
in an ER before?

03:00.781 --> 03:02.683
You know, Dr.
Romano's gone,

03:02.716 --> 03:03.851
and we all get
along great.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.419
In my experience,

03:05.453 --> 03:07.288
all work environments
could use a little help,

03:07.321 --> 03:09.323
especially when navigating
the twin dangers

03:09.357 --> 03:11.425
of anger and conflict.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.563
Morris. Morris,
I'm going to kill you.

03:15.596 --> 03:16.864
I'm sorry.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.266
Here, have one.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.634
Don't put those there.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:31.645 --> 03:33.381
( grunts )

03:36.850 --> 03:38.586
Thank you.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.388
Idiot.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.837
John?

05:25.793 --> 05:27.395
What are you doing?

05:27.395 --> 05:30.097
I was going to make
you breakfast in bed.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.099
Did you lock Emily
in the guest house?

05:32.132 --> 05:34.468
No, I gave her
the day off.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.970
She's convinced that
we're going to burn
the house down.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.106
Oh, let's, and then we can run
off to the jungle

05:39.139 --> 05:40.641
and live off sticks
and berries.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.643
Is my cooking that bad?

05:42.676 --> 05:43.777
Ow!

05:43.811 --> 05:46.714
Oh, let me do it.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.116
Did they give you a
hard time about going
in to work today?

05:49.149 --> 05:51.752
No. I think Luka's
forced everybody

05:51.785 --> 05:53.654
to lower their expectations.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.489
If we show up
without resigning,

05:55.523 --> 05:57.791
Weaver thinks
it's a good day.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.494
We've got a whole
day alone together.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.662
What are we
going to we do?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.497
I have a list.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.669
This is everything that
I wanted to show you in Chicago

06:08.702 --> 06:10.438
that we haven't done yet.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.139
Oh...

06:12.172 --> 06:13.541
( paper crunches )

06:13.574 --> 06:14.708
Ice skating
in Grant Park.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.743
Yeah, that's one.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.711
And the Art Institute?

06:17.745 --> 06:20.113
Yeah, that-that,
among others.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.850
So, where should we start?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.487
I have an idea.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.921
Would you get a sexual history

06:27.955 --> 06:30.023
on a 14-year-old
with a twisted ankle?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.859
Uh, depends on
the girl. Why?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.194
Weaver. I'm used
to the squawk,

06:34.227 --> 06:35.896
but she was totally
condescending.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.665
Morris, belly pain in Three's
been waiting on you

06:37.698 --> 06:39.132
for over an hour.
Okay. Hey!

06:39.166 --> 06:41.001
You're getting big.
Do you mind?

06:41.034 --> 06:42.470
Uh, yeah.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.004
Do you want to try a
dislocated shoulder?

06:44.037 --> 06:46.540
Yeah. Can I do
the Hennepin maneuver?

06:46.574 --> 06:47.908
Are you getting married,

06:47.941 --> 06:49.643
or is that kid going to grow up
a bastard?

06:49.677 --> 06:51.779
Shut up, Frank.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.482
So, what is going on
with you and Chuck?

06:54.482 --> 06:56.049
He's pushing
to get married,

06:56.083 --> 06:57.785
buy a minivan, fire up
the backyard barbecue.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.087
I don't know.
Oh, Dr. Lewis.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.756
How often do you find yourself
the subject of unwanted

07:02.790 --> 07:04.758
physical
contact at work?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.527
LEWIS:
What?
Hey, Abby,

07:06.560 --> 07:07.995
can you do a fly-by
on a swollen knee?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.697
This guy's demanding
pain meds,

07:09.730 --> 07:12.566
wants to see a
doctor right away.
Sure.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.702
But is tactile contact
between employees

07:14.735 --> 07:17.170
something that
is encouraged
or frowned upon?

07:17.204 --> 07:19.507
How many blonde
bimbos you got
in this hospital?

07:19.540 --> 07:20.641
Just the right number.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.842
Miguel, this
is Dr. Lockhart.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.010
Student doctor,
actually.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.645
What's that mean?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.079
It means she's studying
all the latest medicine.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.582
That looks painful.
How'd you do it?

07:28.616 --> 07:30.117
Fell off a ladder.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.585
Look, I got to
get back to work.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.086
What kind of work
do you do?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.922
Hang drywall. It'll
go away, all right?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.189
You just give
me some Vicodin,

07:36.223 --> 07:37.791
and I can get off
your plate.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.059
We're going to take good care
of your knee

07:39.092 --> 07:40.928
and get you home
as fast as we can.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.095
Now, when did
you fall?
All right, what do you have?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.196
I'm not ready
to present.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.265
Knee effusion
from a fall?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.635
Drain it, pain meds,
and send him on his way.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.737
That's what I said.
I haven't finished
doing a history.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.005
Abby, we got 30 on the board
and 50 still waiting.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.207
We're backed up 18 hours,
and this is an easy case.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.876
Come on. Next patient.
Let's go.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.578
I'll get a setup for you.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.846
Med students always want
to spend an hour

07:58.879 --> 08:00.080
with each patient.
It wasn't an hour,

08:00.113 --> 08:02.015
and she was doing
a great job.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.217
Dr. Pratt, if you
have a minute...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.120
I'd like to talk to
you later about that
incident with Dr. Morris.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.858
That wasn't an incident;
it was a French fry.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.760
How's that feel?
Is that too tight?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.762
No, it's perfect.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.764
Oh, I love it...

08:16.797 --> 08:19.733
seeing your whole face.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.569
Are you colder now?

08:21.602 --> 08:24.204
Yeah.

08:24.237 --> 08:27.708
Well, that is what
scarves are for.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.044
That and kissing.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.679
This is where
you used to skate

08:32.712 --> 08:33.947
when you were a kid?

08:33.981 --> 08:35.582
Uh, no. There used
to be another one

08:35.582 --> 08:37.017
on the other side
of Grant Park.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.587
My grandfather used
to rent it out for us.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.089
All right. Ready?

08:42.121 --> 08:44.191
I don't know.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.860
Whoa, ho, ho, ho!

08:46.894 --> 08:48.596
Yeah?

08:48.596 --> 08:49.597
So, who's us?

08:49.630 --> 08:51.832
My brother and I.
Oh.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.334
Your grandfather
would rent you
the entire rink

08:54.367 --> 08:55.603
just for the two of you?

08:55.603 --> 08:57.605
Yeah, and our friends.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.206
A lot of
friends, I hope.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.208
Usually. You know,
I wasn't quite as pampered

09:01.241 --> 09:02.610
as I make it sound.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.177
No, of course not.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.046
Whoo!

09:06.079 --> 09:08.616
( laughs )

09:11.652 --> 09:13.754
I still don't
see anything.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.355
Once you have the blades
fully in,

09:15.388 --> 09:16.924
pull pressure straight down,

09:16.957 --> 09:19.893
and the cervix
should come into view.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.629
Can you set up
for cultures?

09:21.629 --> 09:23.764
Sure.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.098
So, when did
the bleeding start?

09:25.132 --> 09:26.800
Uh, last night.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.937
It's weird 'cause I'm usually
pretty regular.

09:29.970 --> 09:33.340
Sorry. Dr. Kovac.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.008
Mm?
Vulvar hematoma,

09:35.042 --> 09:36.644
multiple bruises
and vaginal tears--

09:36.677 --> 09:38.646
one at least three centimeters.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.682
It'll need suturing.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.350
Lido and 3-0 vicryl.

09:46.286 --> 09:50.157
Layla, uh... there's
some vaginal trauma.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.961
Uh, is that from...
too much sex?

09:53.994 --> 09:57.665
Could be
from the kind of sex.

09:57.698 --> 10:01.234
Has, um... anyone
forced themselves on you?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.936
What?

10:02.970 --> 10:06.239
Did anyone touch you
in a way that, uh, hurt you,

10:06.273 --> 10:09.109
or that you didn't
give permission for?

10:09.142 --> 10:10.644
No.

10:10.678 --> 10:13.346
Do you have a boyfriend?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.683
A... fiancé.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.752
Dean.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.854
He's in college.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.423
Do you and Dean, um...?

10:23.456 --> 10:26.059
Does it ever get rough?

10:26.093 --> 10:29.396
Well, we get a little
carried away sometimes.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.798
How old is that girl?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.000
16. What are you
doing tonight?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.669
What?
A patient invited me
to his restaurant,

10:35.703 --> 10:36.870
and I thought
we could go.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.305
Does Alex like
Korean food?

10:38.338 --> 10:40.340
Oh, Alex has a sleepover.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.710
Nine victims total--
we're getting three more
after they're cut out.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.111
Gus Loomer, 50s,
altered LOC.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.713
He's wearing
a heart monitor.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.715
Pulse irregular,
but in the mid-90s.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.984
How did it happen?
He plowed his Hummer
into two oncoming cars.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.853
One, two...

10:52.886 --> 10:54.722
What do you want,
Gallant?
Full trauma panel,

10:54.755 --> 10:57.257
lateral c-spine, chest,
pelvis and a 12-lead EKG.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.127
Okay. Add a set
of troponins and
talk to the patient.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.095
Mr. Loomer,
you're at County Hospital.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.264
You were in a car accident.
I was driving.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.033
I must have blacked out.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.768
Have you been having
heart palpitations?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.770
Uh, I had a heart attack
two years ago.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.772
Call Cards to interrogate
the monitor

11:11.805 --> 11:13.741
and go see if they need any help
with the other traumas.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.275
Okay.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.444
How bad is it?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.780
We're still assessing
your injuries, sir.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.449
No, no, no, not-not me...
my Hummer.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.951
It's brand-new.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.452
Okay, C-spine is clear.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.056
Can you find out about my car?

11:29.089 --> 11:31.491
Not right now, sir.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.127
We've got three more victims
from the MVA,

11:34.161 --> 11:35.462
two of them critical.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.429
Is he stable enough
to be moved?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.464
Yes.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.332
What's MVA?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.501
Motor vehicle accident.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.804
Oh. Going to be a lot
of crashes today.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.039
It's icy out there.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.976
SAM:
He's hypoxic. He
could be retaining.

11:49.009 --> 11:52.512
KOVAC:
Hang a gram of ancef
and update his tetanus.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.314
SAM:
You sending
him to CT?

11:54.347 --> 11:56.383
KOVAC:
No. Belly's benign.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.151
We'll follow his serial crits.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.420
Good day to be driving a Hummer.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.789
NEELA:
Sam, we need you to get

12:01.822 --> 12:03.323
the pede's airway box.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.158
There was a
kid involved?
Mom and dad, too.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.027
Oh... damned shame.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.164
He doesn't know?
No, he was unconscious
at the scene.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.499
GALLANT:
This is the dad.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.334
Lungs down,
hypoxic and altered.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.368
We need the room.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.804
Can you move him out?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.175
WOMAN:
Oh, my God...

12:22.209 --> 12:23.343
What've we got?

12:23.376 --> 12:24.978
Kathy Shepard.
A&O times four.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.446
Breath sounds clear,
good radial pulses.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.948
Please,
is my family okay?

12:27.981 --> 12:30.083
We're working on your husband
and your son.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.418
Any loss
of consciousness?
No.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.386
But what about my daughter?
What daughter?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.222
Morris...
But they never
brought in a girl.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.890
Oh, my God,
is she dead?!

12:36.924 --> 12:39.526
Is she dead
and you're not telling me?!

12:39.559 --> 12:41.461
Distal perfusion sucks.
I can't get a line.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.529
Draw up etomidate.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.097
What's his weight?

12:44.131 --> 12:47.835
Uh, about 25 kilos,
same as Alex.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.373
Oh... God,
he's been scalped.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.075
WEAVER:
Exposed skull and galea

12:55.108 --> 12:56.409
with a big hematoma.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.311
Neck's broken,
C-5 and 6.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.513
WEAVER:
We'll need Gardener-
Wells tongs

13:00.547 --> 13:02.015
to stabilize the neck.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.383
Page neurosurg.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.052
( whispering ):
Where's my mommy?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.056
It's all right, sweetie.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.058
Mark the placement
point for the tongs.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.466
They're all beautiful.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.135
Most of these
are over a hundred years ago.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.271
These were all built
for the doctors and lawyers

13:24.304 --> 13:28.341
and managers who'd moved west
with the railroads.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.611
It's my favorite street
in Chicago.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.413
What do you think
of this one?

13:33.446 --> 13:35.082
It's lovely.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.450
Yeah. You like it?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.552
Yeah.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.121
What?

13:41.154 --> 13:44.257
Mm, I was thinking
maybe we could buy it.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.926
Really?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.494
Actually, I may have
already bought it.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.362
I had to put
a deposit down.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.465
There were four
other interested buyers.

13:52.499 --> 13:56.269
We need to have someplace
to stay when we're here.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.238
What about your
grandmother's castle?

13:58.271 --> 13:59.606
We could sell it.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.241
What will your
father say?

14:01.274 --> 14:04.311
Uh... he might get
a little upset, but...

14:04.344 --> 14:06.914
Gamma left the house to me.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.949
I don't want to live there.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.920
Are you sure?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.488
It is a little bit more space
than we need.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.224
Mm-hmm.

14:17.257 --> 14:21.161
We can get our deposit back...
if you don't like it.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.496
I love it.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.933
Yeah?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.435
Yeah.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.971
They sent two people
to Mercy and two
to Northwestern.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.339
Why would they split us up?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.041
In a big multi-victim
accident,

14:34.074 --> 14:35.675
one hospital can't take care
of everyone.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.510
There were ten victims total.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.179
We could only handle four.
Yes, I'm
still holding.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.148
No, that's eight.
What happened to the other two?

14:41.181 --> 14:44.217
Uh, there were two fatalities
at the scene.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.518
What?!
Kathy...

14:45.552 --> 14:47.520
Oh, my...
Kathy...

14:47.554 --> 14:49.957
Kathy, we don't
know anything yet.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.596
Paul?
Mrs. Shepard.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.531
What was the
last hemocue?
10.2.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.200
He has to get
into the OR.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.369
He's losing
blood somewhere.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.037
Ethan. Where's Ethan?

15:04.071 --> 15:05.205
Ethan.
RASGOTRA:
How far?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.539
What are you doing to him?

15:06.573 --> 15:08.341
Until it's anchored
in the skull.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.177
No!

15:10.210 --> 15:12.145
WEAVER:
Dr. Kovac.
Reverse Trendelenburg.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.713
Stop it!

15:13.746 --> 15:16.649
Stop it...

15:20.620 --> 15:24.391
( screaming and sobbing ):
Get off me!

15:24.424 --> 15:27.127
Oh, God...
Your husband
has suffered

15:27.160 --> 15:30.063
massive injuries
to his chest.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.700
Both lungs are
collapsed, and he's
bleeding internally.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.235
What about Ethan?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.736
What about you?

15:36.769 --> 15:40.340
You-you were in
there with him.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.741
Tell me!

15:41.774 --> 15:44.077
Uh, Dr. Weaver
will talk to you.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.278
Please, please,
what was that thing

15:45.312 --> 15:48.015
they were screwing
into his head?

15:50.450 --> 15:53.320
Ethan has a broken neck.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.722
The tongs help prevent
paralysis.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.690
Paralysis?

16:02.562 --> 16:05.598
There's been, uh, severe injury
to Ethan's spine,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.267
and his lungs,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.037
and probably
his brain.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.473
They're dying, aren't they?

16:13.506 --> 16:15.608
We don't know yet.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.511
Where should I go now?

16:18.545 --> 16:21.048
I'm sorry?

16:24.717 --> 16:27.087
Who's going to die first?

16:30.823 --> 16:31.791
I've had this
ice cream cone

16:31.824 --> 16:33.160
for nearly
two hours,

16:33.193 --> 16:34.427
and it hasn't
even melted yet.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.229
That's just one
of the many,

16:36.263 --> 16:38.465
many wonderful things
about winters in Chicago.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.504
My grandparents
got married here.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.274
And my parents.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.242
Is that
a proposal?

16:49.276 --> 16:50.443
You want it to be?

16:50.477 --> 16:52.312
( laughs )

16:52.345 --> 16:54.081
No. I thought because breakfast
in bed didn't quite work out,

16:54.081 --> 16:55.115
we'd try for lunch.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.483
Are we going
to check in?

16:56.516 --> 16:59.152
We already have.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.553
Beth Shepard.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.189
No, Kathy Shepard's
here at County.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.090
I'm looking for her
daughter, Beth.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.592
I should get a smaller set
of sandbags.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.160
Stabilize the tongs

17:07.194 --> 17:08.461
while I add five
pounds of traction.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.596
Can you at
least tell me

17:09.628 --> 17:11.164
what hospital
she was sent to?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.099
Abby, I need you
to hold the counterweight.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.305
Layla's been
waiting three hours

17:18.338 --> 17:19.539
for a repeat crit.

17:19.571 --> 17:21.508
Go on. He's stable.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.343
I'll take three
of your patients

17:23.376 --> 17:24.711
if you take over
for me in there.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.679
No, thanks.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.681
How you doing?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.383
Fine.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.651
Uh, when can I go?

17:31.684 --> 17:33.753
As soon
as we get these results in.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.123
Nurse, can I have
some orange juice?

17:40.427 --> 17:42.129
And when he said that,

17:42.129 --> 17:43.730
did you feel threatened
or just uncomfortable?

17:43.763 --> 17:46.533
I mean, would you categorize
his comments as hostile

17:46.566 --> 17:48.701
or merely insensitive?

17:48.735 --> 17:49.769
Can I still have sex?

17:49.802 --> 17:52.372
Not for a couple weeks.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.740
What?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.208
Just tell your boyfriend...

17:55.242 --> 17:56.609
Fiancé.

17:56.643 --> 18:00.213
Just tell him
that he needs to settle down.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.484
If he really loves you,
he'll understand.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.620
Dean loves me.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.456
We're getting
married.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.160
You know, sometimes
you can love someone

18:13.160 --> 18:15.828
and not realize
that they're hurting you.

18:17.630 --> 18:21.434
He doesn't mean
to hurt me.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.170
But does he?

18:23.170 --> 18:25.572
Hurt you sometimes?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.740
Did he hurt you last night?

18:29.909 --> 18:33.180
I don't know.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.416
What do you mean?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.819
We went on a drive
last night

18:39.852 --> 18:42.889
with two of his friends.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.892
We went to this park
near his house.

18:48.228 --> 18:51.564
He tells me I'm sexy
all the time.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.700
He just likes to show me off.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.803
Well, show you off how?

18:56.836 --> 19:00.540
Uh, sometimes he likes
to let them watch.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.579
Do they ever...

19:06.613 --> 19:08.881
do more than watch?

19:13.520 --> 19:15.388
Layla?

19:17.224 --> 19:19.459
Yeah.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.528
Sam, we need you
to set up another IMED.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.729
Get Duvata.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.897
She's busy.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.735
We're going
to figure this out, okay?

19:28.768 --> 19:30.570
Sam, now.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.472
TAGGART:
I'll be right back.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.374
Dispatch RDC can't tell me
where Kathy's daughter went,

19:34.407 --> 19:35.775
or even if she's still alive.

19:35.808 --> 19:36.943
The father's maxed out
on three pressors,

19:36.976 --> 19:38.445
he arrested twice,
and I don't know

19:38.478 --> 19:40.480
how long he's
going to last long.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.348
( alarms beeping )
WEAVER:
Decreased on the right.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.982
( knocking )

19:43.015 --> 19:44.417
Pratt wanted that guy
discharged.

19:44.451 --> 19:45.885
You know, I'm busy.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.920
Betadine. Let's
do this again.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.322
Doesn't look good.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.890
Needle decompression
and chest tube.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.259
Where are my pain pills?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.393
You can't be in here.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.527
You're going
to have to wait.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.828
No! I got to see you now.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.963
Abby, get him
out of here.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.531
Tachy at 124.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.766
We're still waiting
on some tests.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.900
I don't need any tests!

20:00.933 --> 20:01.968
Abby.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.002
BP's dropping
again.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.237
This is stupid.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.772
We're just torturing him.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.507
LOCKHART:
Let's go.
( Miguel coughing )

20:16.516 --> 20:17.917
Hi.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.687
Mm. Hi.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.591
Was this on
your list?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.726
Several times.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.665
I hope he has
your nose.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.634
You have a
lovely nose.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.939
What do you want him
to be when he grows up?

20:39.972 --> 20:41.574
I don't care.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.377
As long as he's healthy
and happy.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.912
( laughs )

20:45.945 --> 20:49.349
Okay, I'm deciding
between Cy Young award-winner

20:49.382 --> 20:53.420
and the guy who cures cancer.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.688
I think he'll be
astoundingly cute.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.291
Well, nature likes
genetic diversity.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.926
We should make him
marry an Asian

20:59.959 --> 21:00.960
or Hispanic girl.

21:00.993 --> 21:04.564
Mm.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.366
You know
what frightens me most?

21:06.399 --> 21:07.667
Hmm?

21:07.700 --> 21:11.771
That I could get used
to all of this.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.840
Well, I'm not going

21:13.873 --> 21:16.943
to be renting out
any ice rinks for him.

21:16.976 --> 21:17.977
No?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.346
Uh-uh.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.349
That's what I ran away from.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.559
Good femoral pulse.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.093
All that epi
kicked his BP up.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.029
Sam.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.567
Layla's pregnant?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.370
I can't get his sats above 80.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.604
Did you call
social work?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.406
Yeah, but they're slow
as hell.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.840
Subq air
in the neck.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.075
Let me tell her.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.477
Okay.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.479
Haleh, I'll be
right back, okay?

21:52.512 --> 21:53.980
TAGGART:
We do a pregnancy test

21:54.013 --> 21:56.549
on all female patients
of childbearing age.

21:56.583 --> 21:59.386
Yours came back positive.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.420
I'm pregnant?

22:00.453 --> 22:01.754
Yes.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.023
Do you use birth control?

22:04.056 --> 22:07.827
I was on the pill for a while,
but it made me fat.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.863
Oh, my God.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.865
This is incredible.

22:12.899 --> 22:13.900
Layla, do your parents...?

22:13.933 --> 22:15.402
I've got to call Dean.

22:15.402 --> 22:16.503
He's going to go
through the roof!

22:16.536 --> 22:18.571
You can't use
that in here.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.742
Listen, you need to
seriously consider

22:22.775 --> 22:25.111
whether or not you want
to keep this pregnancy.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.913
Oh, Dean loves kids.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.550
What you think
you want now may not be

22:30.583 --> 22:32.084
what you're going
to want in five years.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.521
Or next year.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.922
Or even in six months.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.924
We need a SonoSite in here.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.060
I'll be back.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.995
MIGUEL:
You running some kind of scam?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.798
'Cause I been here nine hours
waiting on some stupid tests.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.767
Hey, man,
I hear you.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.101
Sam, how come Mr.
Rivas hasn't been
discharged yet?

22:49.135 --> 22:51.103
Abby's still waiting
on some labs.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.905
Mr. Loomer?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.441
Hey, can you take this
to Trauma One?

22:54.474 --> 22:55.742
Sure.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.143
Ms. Taggart, I would love
the opportunity

22:57.176 --> 22:58.745
to sit down with you

22:58.778 --> 22:59.979
and discuss appropriate
workplace conduct

23:00.012 --> 23:01.080
when you have a moment.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.081
I don't, okay?
Maybe later.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.583
I won't then, either.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.851
Mr. Loomer, you got
to get back to bed.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.885
What's-What's
happening in there?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.019
Come on.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.187
You have a heart condition.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.756
Is-Is he dead?

23:11.791 --> 23:12.792
Yeah.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.627
Damn shame.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.463
Come on. You got
to get back to bed.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.464
I bought that
car on a whim.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.731
You have a heart condition.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.032
Cost me half my
retirement savings.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.601
You shouldn't be wandering
around the hall,

23:21.634 --> 23:22.702
and you should really
leave these people alone.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.836
Mid-life crisis
thing, but hell,

23:23.870 --> 23:25.137
it probably
saved my life.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.073
I-I could've
ended up like...

23:27.106 --> 23:28.975
like that poor
schmuck in there.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.977
You drove your car
into that family.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.682
You were unconscious
on the scene.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.216
Your Hummer slammed
into their car

23:37.249 --> 23:39.552
and went right over it.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.891
Ooh.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.859
I-I...

23:46.893 --> 23:48.795
I don't... I
don't remember.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.998
Is that Mr. Loomer?

23:52.031 --> 23:53.866
( panting )
Oh, God.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.202
I need some
help here!

23:56.235 --> 23:57.804
Shirt.

23:57.837 --> 23:58.905
What happened?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.507
Syncope.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.644
Get a quick look.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.081
V tach.

24:09.115 --> 24:12.785
Okay, charge to 200.

24:12.819 --> 24:13.853
Clear.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.187
( zapping )

24:15.221 --> 24:16.523
Sinus.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.024
Got a pulse.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.863
Okay, can you at least
tell me how serious the...?

24:23.896 --> 24:25.064
She's alive.

24:25.097 --> 24:27.033
Okay. When can I
call back to...?

24:27.066 --> 24:28.200
Okay.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.168
Fine. Thank you.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.803
She's at Mercy Hospital.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.204
The doctors are working
on her right now.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.806
What's wrong with her?
I'm sorry,
I couldn't

24:33.840 --> 24:35.174
get more specifics,
but I'm pushing

24:35.207 --> 24:36.643
for a transfer here
as soon as possible.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.646
I just want to know
if she's okay.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.881
Do you want to be
with your son, Kathy?

24:41.914 --> 24:43.282
Will you go with me?

24:43.315 --> 24:45.051
Sure.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.890
Labs back on your knee effusion,
Miguel Rivas.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.559
AFB's positive.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.027
Okay, um, I'm sorry.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.162
Can you take Mrs. Shepard in?

24:56.195 --> 24:57.564
Of course.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.232
I'll be back in a minute.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.701
Pratt.
What?

25:01.734 --> 25:02.835
Miguel's knee effusion
is from TB.

25:02.869 --> 25:03.836
What?!

25:03.870 --> 25:04.871
I looked at his old charts.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.205
He had multi-drug-resistant TB

25:06.238 --> 25:07.139
15 months ago; he
stopped showing up

25:07.173 --> 25:08.307
to observed therapy.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.842
But there was no fever,
no coughing.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.143
Because of the history,
I did AFB stain,

25:11.177 --> 25:12.178
which is positive,
and he's coughing,

25:12.211 --> 25:13.279
so he's probably
infectious.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.815
Where is he?
I just discharged him.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.316
Well, we have
to find him

25:17.349 --> 25:19.018
before he starts coughing
up TB all over the El.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.687
I gave him a prescription.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.988
Call the pharmacy.
I'll see if he's still there.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.155
Miguel!

25:23.189 --> 25:24.591
Move this damn thing.

25:24.591 --> 25:25.858
Watch it. Watch it.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.594
Hey, hold the elevator.
Hey!

25:27.594 --> 25:28.595
Damn it.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.730
Damn it.

25:33.833 --> 25:34.834
Hey.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.636
Miguel, hey!

25:36.669 --> 25:38.070
Hey, wait for
the next one.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.238
Come on, man.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.940
( coughing )
Sorry.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.308
All right.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.846
TAGGART:
Hey, Alex.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.280
I just wanted to let you know
that if you don't want to go

25:48.314 --> 25:50.182
to that sleepover tonight,
you don't have to.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.951
We could do something fun
together.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.621
But if you still want to go,
then that's fine, too.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.188
And I just realized
that I'm the only one

25:56.222 --> 25:57.957
who's ever going
to get this message

25:57.990 --> 25:59.792
'cause I never showed you
how to use the voice mail.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.193
Damn it.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.898
I'm sorry,
okay?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.099
How could you do this to me?
Dean...

26:07.133 --> 26:08.067
You're getting rid of it.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.301
But it's our baby.

26:09.335 --> 26:10.336
You need to leave.
How do I even

26:10.369 --> 26:11.904
know it's mine?
I love you.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.240
Get out! You need
to leave right now.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.908
What's going on?
Oh, who's this?

26:15.942 --> 26:17.276
One of your buddies
from the gang bang squad?

26:17.309 --> 26:18.811
She knows?
Get out of here,
both of you.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.012
I told you
she'd talk.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.113
Hey, I don't know
what she told you,

26:21.147 --> 26:22.148
but we didn't make her
do anything

26:22.181 --> 26:23.315
she didn't want to do.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.216
Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you

26:24.250 --> 26:25.652
tell that to the cops.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.953
She lies, okay?
You heard her.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.220
If it was true, why
would she still

26:28.254 --> 26:30.389
be saying she
loves me? Hold on.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.658
Let go of me.

26:31.658 --> 26:32.825
Look,

26:32.859 --> 26:34.293
she's just a
stupid little slut.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.733
( grunts )

26:40.767 --> 26:42.068
( sighs )

26:47.774 --> 26:49.208
( sighs )

27:00.987 --> 27:02.254
Hey, how long is it going
to take in here?

27:02.288 --> 27:04.056
I've been here 12 hours,
going on 13 now.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.692
Keep your mask on.
Yo, nurse!

27:05.692 --> 27:06.893
I'm talking
to you!

27:15.835 --> 27:17.704
( sneezing )

27:17.704 --> 27:18.838
Hey, Frank?
Hmm?

27:18.871 --> 27:20.239
Has my kid called?
No.

27:20.272 --> 27:21.708
He was supposed to call
a half hour ago.

27:21.741 --> 27:22.909
Maybe he's busy.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.443
Can you hold for
a tap in Three?

27:24.476 --> 27:26.278
Weaver said you're not supposed
to see any more patients

27:26.312 --> 27:27.446
till you talk to her.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.748
You're supposed
to wait here for her.

27:28.781 --> 27:29.916
I got it.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.217
Don't hit me;
I'm just the messenger.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.052
I don't trust him.
He didn't understand.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.054
He stopped taking the pills
when he stopped feeling sick.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.455
I want Miguel
in isolation,

27:36.488 --> 27:38.157
and if he can't take
his meds on his own,

27:38.190 --> 27:39.792
I want him handcuffed
and force-fed.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.127
Oh, he just
started coughing.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.729
You're really going
to call the police?

27:42.729 --> 27:44.396
The guy's a
ticking time bomb.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.465
Are we throwing
all our TB patients in jail?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.400
'Cause it's not sustainable.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.036
If this is how we treat
people with TB,

27:50.069 --> 27:51.738
they are going to stop
coming to this hospital.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.840
Abby, it's not like they
all go clubbing together.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.742
No, but they hang out
at the TB clinic.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.209
Miguel needs
six months of therapy.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.377
And you think
you can do that?

27:58.410 --> 28:00.747
I want to try
to make him cooperate

28:00.747 --> 28:02.081
with the health
care system.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.415
Hey...

28:03.449 --> 28:04.751
FRANK:
You're supposed
to stay put.

28:04.751 --> 28:05.852
If you still want to talk...

28:05.885 --> 28:07.086
Maybe later.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.220
You waiting for Weaver?
Yeah.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.322
Don't hit her.
She's crippled.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.758
( chuckling )

28:11.758 --> 28:13.492
Never stops being funny,
does it?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.161
Sam.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.428
How's Ethan?

28:16.462 --> 28:17.496
Pressure's holding.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.231
Last gas looks better.

28:19.265 --> 28:21.133
Mr. Nadler is recommending
your immediate dismissal.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.034
What?

28:22.068 --> 28:23.335
He called for references

28:23.369 --> 28:24.837
at three other hospitals
you've worked for.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.205
You've had prior incidents.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.840
I never got fired
from any of those jobs.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.175
Yeah, because you left
before they could.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.209
Look, I'm a good nurse.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.078
If you want me here, fine.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.946
If not, I'll find another job
just as good somewhere else.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.248
Something tells me
you've used
that speech before.

28:36.282 --> 28:37.449
It's clear
to everyone

28:37.483 --> 28:38.818
that you have
an impulse

28:38.851 --> 28:40.386
control problem.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.454
The guy helped his friends
gang-rape his girlfriend.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.256
We'll probably get sued.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.357
The kid's in PEA.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.458
All right.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.794
The Director of Nursing

28:47.794 --> 28:49.295
will talk to you
tomorrow at 8:00.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.497
For what it's worth,
I wish I'd hit him harder.

28:51.530 --> 28:54.867
You know, it's a
lot warmer here
in the summertime.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.169
I like Chicago.

28:57.203 --> 29:00.807
In the summertime, the
lake is full of sailboats.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.043
I can't live here, John.

29:04.076 --> 29:08.247
My work-- it's... important.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.382
I know.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.483
What terminal?

29:11.517 --> 29:14.353
United, Terminal 1.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.456
We could just disappear,
and no one would ever know.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.826
Yeah, I'd like that.

29:19.859 --> 29:23.195
Me, too.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.964
The pills made me sick.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.365
If you stop taking the pills
before you're supposed to,

29:26.398 --> 29:28.234
you're only going to kill
some of the TB,

29:28.267 --> 29:29.435
and the bacteria
that's left

29:29.468 --> 29:31.470
is going to get stronger
and multiply,

29:31.503 --> 29:33.405
and then none of the medicine
is going to work.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.207
Abby?

29:38.878 --> 29:40.546
Did you call
the cops yet?

29:40.579 --> 29:42.114
No, not yet.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.850
You're wasting your
time with this guy.

29:43.883 --> 29:44.917
Call the cops.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.118
Hey, what are you doing?

29:46.152 --> 29:47.486
I'm getting the hell
out of here.

29:47.519 --> 29:48.888
Well, it's not that simple.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.022
You can't just leave.

29:50.056 --> 29:51.390
I'll take
the damn pills, okay?

29:51.423 --> 29:52.959
You need to go to the
TB clinic every day

29:52.992 --> 29:53.993
for observed therapy.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.161
I don't need that.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.328
Oh, Abby,

29:56.362 --> 29:57.396
Mercy for you
on line one.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.965
Okay. Miguel, stop.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.167
It's about that woman's
daughter, Beth Shepard?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.102
Don't be an idiot.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.038
Okay, Security,
stop this guy.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.106
Hold it!

30:07.139 --> 30:08.407
Come here, please.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.408
Hey, come on.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.977
Come on.
Take it easy.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.444
Come on!

30:15.014 --> 30:16.248
( grunting )

30:16.282 --> 30:17.950
Don't hurt him.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.587
I don't want you to leave.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.156
I don't want to leave.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.457
Well, then stay.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.393
I can't.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.999
It'll be all right.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.151
( no audio )

30:57.056 --> 30:59.358
Your halter monitor
records every heartbeat

30:59.391 --> 31:01.027
and stores it for 24 hours.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.594
Thanks.

31:02.628 --> 31:06.032
It appears you had a run
of V-tach at 8:20 A.M.

31:06.065 --> 31:09.936
8:20? Is that about
when I crashed?

31:09.969 --> 31:12.438
Your arrhythmia
caused you to black out.

31:12.471 --> 31:15.507
But upon impact,
it seems you reverted to sinus

31:15.541 --> 31:17.143
almost instantly.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.246
You mean the car crash
saved my life?

31:20.279 --> 31:22.014
Yeah.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.455
How long?

31:29.488 --> 31:31.490
41 minutes.

31:31.523 --> 31:32.992
Hold compressions.

31:33.025 --> 31:37.296
Pace at 80.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.198
No capture.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.969
Another atropine
and resume CPR.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.173
PEA.

31:49.141 --> 31:52.979
Mrs. Shepard, your
son has no pulse.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.982
His brain has been
deprived of oxygen
for almost an hour.

31:55.982 --> 31:58.284
I think we
should stop.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.024
But it's still beeping.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.458
It can take
some time

32:06.492 --> 32:10.096
for the electrical activity
in the heart to stop.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.432
( sniffling )

32:13.465 --> 32:15.001
What about my daughter?

32:15.001 --> 32:16.368
I'll find out.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.685
I thought my life

32:33.719 --> 32:39.425
was over after my...
my first heart attack.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.627
I couldn't work.

32:41.660 --> 32:45.131
I couldn't walk upstairs and...

32:45.164 --> 32:48.067
I couldn't have sex.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.337
I felt like I was dead.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.605
I never thought
I'd get married,

32:53.639 --> 32:55.374
have two kids.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.709
Wasn't the type.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.779
I always thought that stuff
would mean life was over.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.548
But then...

33:07.453 --> 33:10.489
I got pregnant.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.125
Paul was so excited.

33:13.159 --> 33:17.329
He was always more excited
about everything.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.532
GUS:
I thought my wife
was going to leave me.

33:20.566 --> 33:23.669
You know, I mean,
I thought she should.

33:23.702 --> 33:27.206
But she didn't. She...

33:27.239 --> 33:29.608
She made me get out of bed
in the morning.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.577
I'll take any seat.
I just need to get to the gate.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.212
Sorry, Amsterdam's
completely sold out.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.614
Another flight. Anything.

33:35.647 --> 33:38.084
I have a first
class to Tokyo.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.418
It's $9,000.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.521
GUS:
The car cost $110,000.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.190
But she didn't care.

33:44.223 --> 33:47.526
She said, "Gus,
you spoil yourself.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.395
You deserve it."

33:49.428 --> 33:52.831
So... that's
what I did.

33:52.864 --> 33:57.169
I went out and bought
myself my dream car...

33:57.203 --> 33:58.737
and took it
for a drive.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.839
KATHY:
I'd been having these dreams.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.443
Fantasies.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.245
Stretching out alone
at night.

34:06.278 --> 34:09.514
You know, reading a book.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.652
Now I can.

34:17.322 --> 34:20.426
Did I make
this happen?

34:20.458 --> 34:23.862
Why, why should I
be the lucky one?

34:23.895 --> 34:27.199
Why should
I be spared?

34:27.233 --> 34:29.235
No one knows
why these things happen.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.335
You have to believe

34:30.369 --> 34:32.804
there's a reason
you're still here.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.206
KATHY:
Late start this morning.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.277
Ethan wanted ice cream.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.179
He always wants
these crazy things,

34:40.212 --> 34:42.614
today I said okay.

34:42.648 --> 34:46.252
Can you imagine ice cream
in winter?

35:03.769 --> 35:06.172
ABBY:
She's in here.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.744
Oh...!

35:15.781 --> 35:18.284
Oh...!

35:46.612 --> 35:48.914
KEM:
John?

36:01.793 --> 36:03.429
Hi.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.964
Can I get four coffees,
three chili dogs,

36:05.997 --> 36:07.666
and in a separate bag, please,

36:07.699 --> 36:10.369
two plain burgers
and three plain yogurts?

36:10.402 --> 36:12.938
SAM:
Hamburgers and yogurt?

36:12.971 --> 36:14.973
Susan can only eat two
things without throwing up.

36:15.006 --> 36:18.577
Oh, being pregnant sucks.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.911
You want to sit?

36:19.945 --> 36:22.581
Sure.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.652
How are you handling
nursing and student shifts?

36:26.685 --> 36:27.819
Do you ever get
any sleep?

36:27.853 --> 36:30.256
Um, not that much, no.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.590
( chuckles )

36:31.623 --> 36:33.492
That's what you get
for switching careers.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.362
Well, medical school was a
plan for a while, actually.

36:36.395 --> 36:39.465
I just sort of
got sidetracked.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.600
Last thing I remember
wanting to be

36:41.633 --> 36:43.969
was an international spy.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.937
I was 15.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.573
Then I got pregnant.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.976
15? Wow.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.879
Oh, I was like
one of those girls

36:53.912 --> 36:57.683
who gives birth at her prom--
total denial.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.551
By the time I figured out
where the clinic was,

36:59.585 --> 37:02.020
I... didn't have the money.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.922
Alex's dad never kicked in
his half,

37:03.955 --> 37:08.026
and I couldn't get a waitressing
job 'cause I was too young.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.530
So I took double shifts
at Baskin-Robbins

37:11.563 --> 37:14.300
to save up the dough.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.604
Did he go with you?

37:18.637 --> 37:20.739
He was at a gig.

37:20.772 --> 37:24.643
Right.

37:24.676 --> 37:28.447
First time I went,
I sat in the waiting room.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.318
They called my name.
Never got up.

37:36.422 --> 37:40.025
Second time, I was too late.

37:45.764 --> 37:50.336
Now I look at Alex, and I...

37:57.909 --> 37:59.611
The place I went to
had this calendar

37:59.645 --> 38:02.348
on the wall with
a picture of, um...

38:03.949 --> 38:08.354
...Strawberry Shortcake.

38:08.354 --> 38:11.357
I just stared at it
the whole time.

38:17.663 --> 38:18.930
You have
a nursing shift?

38:18.964 --> 38:21.367
Yeah. You're
finished, right?
Yeah.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.435
Oh, here.
Thank you.

38:23.469 --> 38:24.970
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.

38:27.839 --> 38:28.840
KOVAC:
Hey.

38:28.874 --> 38:29.941
Hey.

38:29.975 --> 38:30.976
How's your arm?

38:31.009 --> 38:33.445
Oh, it's okay.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.414
Is Alex having fun
on his sleepover?

38:35.447 --> 38:36.648
Yeah, too much fun

38:36.682 --> 38:37.816
to come to the phone
when I called.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.718
Yeah, sleepovers
are tough.

38:39.751 --> 38:43.389
I mean, on parents,
not kids.

38:43.389 --> 38:46.592
I had a boy and
a girl in Croatia.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.894
Uh, Miss Taggart?

38:48.927 --> 38:50.862
Do you have a minute?

38:50.896 --> 38:52.063
Uh...

38:52.097 --> 38:54.400
Talk to you tomorrow.

38:58.837 --> 39:02.508
LOCKHART:
This is a document, drawn up
by our legal department,

39:02.541 --> 39:03.775
that says you agree
to be admitted

39:03.809 --> 39:05.110
for two weeks for treatment,

39:05.143 --> 39:06.878
and after that,
visit the TB clinic

39:06.912 --> 39:08.480
every morning
for six months.

39:08.514 --> 39:11.750
I'm not signing anything.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.752
I notice you don't have
a Social Security number.

39:13.785 --> 39:17.956
Hey, I been living and working
in this country for ten years.

39:17.989 --> 39:20.592
Good, so you know if you
get arrested for a felony,

39:20.626 --> 39:23.495
la migra's gonna kick your ass
out of the country.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.796
WEAVER:
Oh, where's Dr. Carter?

39:24.830 --> 39:26.532
Sandy's gonna kill me.

39:26.565 --> 39:29.635
Dr. Weaver, we need you
to sign off on a TB admission.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.136
TB on a knee effusion?

39:31.169 --> 39:32.971
See, that's what I mean
by doing a thorough exam.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.940
Good catch, Pratt.
NADLER:
Dr. Weaver.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.642
It was Abby's catch.

39:36.675 --> 39:37.976
Doesn't matter.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.110
Dr. Weaver.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.579
What do you want?

39:40.612 --> 39:41.647
Well, a month alone
in Door County

39:41.680 --> 39:43.482
with my cats and
my French horn,

39:43.515 --> 39:45.784
but I'd settle for
five minutes of your
undivided attention.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.688
This place is a disaster.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.690
I've never seen
anything like it.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.925
I've witnessed your
workers engaging in
bullying, hostility,

39:53.959 --> 39:55.661
violence,
inappropriate touching...

39:55.694 --> 39:56.762
Oh, come on.

39:56.795 --> 39:57.663
We have a good staff.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.097
They do their best.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.699
You have a bunch of walking
lunatics on your hands.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.001
Doctors yelling,
nurses beating up patients.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.202
You need to start firing
people immediately.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.704
Fine. You're fired.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.473
What?
Don't come back tomorrow.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.207
You won't be meeting the terms
of the legal settlement.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.209
So sue me... again.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.578
What else is new?

40:16.515 --> 40:18.216
You're late.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.885
Night shift started
20 minutes ago.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.720
Yeah, I'm sorry.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.954
Where were you?

40:22.988 --> 40:24.956
At the airport,
dropping off Kem.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.057
Oh, yeah?

40:26.091 --> 40:26.992
Where'd she go?

40:27.025 --> 40:31.029
Kisangani.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.231
She have to get back
to her program?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.833
Mm-hmm.

40:34.866 --> 40:40.071
She has 200 HIV patients'
lives to save.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.240
Good for her.
( pager beeping )

40:42.273 --> 40:45.076
Oh, it's Sandy.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.479
She can't believe
I left her alone

40:47.513 --> 40:49.781
with a screaming
baby for 12 hours.

40:51.717 --> 40:53.685
How long will she be gone?

40:53.719 --> 40:56.488
I hope just a couple weeks.

40:56.522 --> 40:57.689
Hey.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.026
Did I show you the new pictures?

41:01.059 --> 41:02.794
No.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.734
( chuckles )

41:08.767 --> 41:09.701
He's pointing
his finger, huh?

41:09.735 --> 41:11.002
Yeah.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.571
I mean, he does
that all the time.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.005
He came out of the
womb doing that.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.841
It's like, "I've
got a point to make."

41:18.810 --> 41:20.579
Oh, he's got
his own personality already.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.881
Yeah, they all do.

41:22.914 --> 41:23.982
You'll see.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.554
( sighs )
( keys clatter )

41:38.664 --> 41:40.932
( sighs )

41:57.749 --> 42:00.819
MAN ( on TV ):
Now, we're in the 30s
in Chesterton, Indiana.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.588
( changing channels )

42:02.621 --> 42:03.955
WOMAN:
Tools that are stylish,
affordable, and...

42:05.824 --> 42:07.959
( turns off TV )

42:19.304 --> 42:21.773
( chuckles softly )

42:28.847 --> 42:31.617
( knocking )

42:34.319 --> 42:36.788
( knocking continues )

42:41.627 --> 42:42.628
Hi.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.730
Hey.

42:44.763 --> 42:48.634
I was going to see if
you'd had dinner yet.

42:48.634 --> 42:50.902
I thought maybe we
could get something.

42:50.936 --> 42:52.270
Come on in.

42:52.303 --> 42:54.740
Let me get my coat.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.012
Wow. Nice place.

43:01.046 --> 43:02.781
Yeah, it's okay.

43:07.152 --> 43:11.657
So... where do
you want to go?

43:11.657 --> 43:14.092
I don't know.

43:15.305 --> 43:21.573
