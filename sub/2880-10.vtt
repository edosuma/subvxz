00:01.149 --> 00:02.549
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.266 --> 00:04.866
Sheldon, did you just figure out

00:04.868 --> 00:08.135
a method for synthesizing a new
stable super-heavy element?

00:08.257 --> 00:09.940
Did I?!

00:09.942 --> 00:11.208
Well, that can't be right.

00:11.210 --> 00:12.909
No one's ever done that before.

00:12.911 --> 00:14.377
Except me because I just did it!

00:14.379 --> 00:16.546
♪ Sheldon and his brain, yeah

00:16.548 --> 00:18.582
♪ Sheldon and his brain,
yeah! ♪

00:18.584 --> 00:20.950
I've made a horrible mistake.

00:20.952 --> 00:22.052
What are you talking about?

00:22.054 --> 00:24.787
This table,
it's in square centimeters

00:24.789 --> 00:26.806
I read it as square meters.

00:26.808 --> 00:28.258
You know what that means?

00:28.260 --> 00:30.844
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

00:32.430 --> 00:36.266
Amy, I was off
by a factor of 10,000.

00:36.268 --> 00:38.685
But the Chinese team
found the element.

00:38.687 --> 00:39.653
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

00:39.655 --> 00:41.605
My calculations were wrong.

00:41.607 --> 00:43.573
The greatest scientific
achievement of my life

00:43.575 --> 00:45.308
is based on a blunder.

00:45.310 --> 00:46.610
I'm not a genius.

00:46.612 --> 00:47.944
I'm a fraud.

00:47.946 --> 00:50.113
You know, Sheldon,
in neuroscience,

00:50.115 --> 00:52.815
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

00:52.817 --> 00:54.284
that we thought was
someplace else.

00:54.286 --> 00:56.986
Oh, great, now I'm
worse than a fraud.

00:56.988 --> 00:59.155
I'm practically a biologist.
someplace else.

01:01.759 --> 01:04.260
This is <i>Science Friday.</i>
I'm Ira Flatow.

01:04.263 --> 01:07.597
My guest today is responsible
for the discovery of the first

01:07.599 --> 01:10.166
stable super-heavy element.

01:10.168 --> 01:11.685
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

01:11.687 --> 01:13.436
Thank you.

01:13.438 --> 01:15.021
Uh, the university
made me come here.

01:15.023 --> 01:16.506
I didn't want to.

01:17.325 --> 01:20.360
Uh, big fan of the show.

01:20.362 --> 01:23.346
So, I understand
that you actually discovered

01:23.348 --> 01:25.532
this element by mistake.

01:27.486 --> 01:29.319
Yes.

01:29.321 --> 01:32.372
And some people in the science
community are calling it

01:32.374 --> 01:34.357
"The Wonder Blunder."

01:34.359 --> 01:36.025
Who? Give me their names.

01:36.027 --> 01:37.911
I bet it's Wolowitz.

01:37.913 --> 01:40.297
It's just such
a fascinating story.

01:40.299 --> 01:41.831
Your calculations are way off,

01:41.833 --> 01:44.200
but they find
the element anyway.

01:44.202 --> 01:46.503
It's like misreading
a treasure map

01:46.505 --> 01:48.922
and still finding the treasure.

01:48.924 --> 01:50.924
Can we talk
about something else?

01:50.926 --> 01:53.510
Do you know that I yodel?

01:55.846 --> 01:57.230
That's interesting,
but this could be taking you

01:57.232 --> 01:59.983
down the path
toward a Nobel Prize.

01:59.985 --> 02:01.351
And in chemistry, no less.

02:01.353 --> 02:03.503
And wouldn't
that be unusual?

02:03.505 --> 02:05.855
Because you're a physicist.

02:05.857 --> 02:08.157
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist
with a Nobel in chemistry.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.360
Everyone laugh
at the circus freak.

02:11.612 --> 02:14.164
You know, I don't need to sit
here and take this, Flatow.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.499
It is because of bullies
like you,

02:16.501 --> 02:18.201
every day

President Seibert, I don't
know why you're yelling.

02:53.813 --> 02:56.180
You're the one who made me
go on the radio.

02:56.182 --> 02:59.017
I was expecting a professional
science interview,

02:59.019 --> 03:02.837
not an attack
by some morning zoo shock jock.

03:04.306 --> 03:06.240
Well, if the university
needs money so badly,

03:06.242 --> 03:09.027
perhaps you should start
a swear jar.

03:10.329 --> 03:13.364
Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

03:14.666 --> 03:16.034
I know you don't like it,

03:16.036 --> 03:17.368
but every time
you do an interview,

03:17.370 --> 03:19.403
it raises the profile
of the university.

03:19.405 --> 03:21.072
That translates to funding.

03:21.074 --> 03:22.090
Yeah, well, I'm not just

03:22.092 --> 03:25.910
some trained monkey
dancing for coins.

03:25.912 --> 03:27.011
Of course you're not.

03:27.013 --> 03:29.047
People love trained monkeys.

03:31.266 --> 03:32.300
How can you not be happy?

03:32.302 --> 03:34.018
You're tall, thin and famous.

03:34.020 --> 03:37.138
Oh, my God,
I'm jealous of Sheldon.

03:38.390 --> 03:39.974
Look, you're gonna be doing
this stuff for a while.

03:39.976 --> 03:42.360
You're just gonna have to find
a way to get used to it.

03:42.362 --> 03:44.261
But none of you know
what this is like.

03:44.263 --> 03:47.431
Being celebrated for something
you wish you never did.

03:47.433 --> 03:50.651
Mmm... you clearly haven't been
with me at Mardi Gras.

03:54.123 --> 03:56.290
Want to pause the video game
and help me clean up?

03:56.292 --> 03:57.458
I am cleaning up.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.877
Look at the mess the Joker made
of Gotham City.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.915
Come on, it's your friend
who's coming to stay here.

04:03.917 --> 04:05.299
Raj grew up in India.

04:05.301 --> 04:07.635
Trust me, he's seen worse.

04:08.303 --> 04:09.453
Howie.

04:09.455 --> 04:10.638
I promise I'll help out

04:10.640 --> 04:11.672
the rest of the week.

04:11.674 --> 04:12.807
The rest of the week?

04:12.809 --> 04:14.625
You said it was just gonna be
a night or two.

04:14.627 --> 04:15.676
Yeah, but if I told you a week,

04:15.678 --> 04:16.594
would you have said yes?

04:16.596 --> 04:20.348
No!
Then you left me no choice.

04:20.350 --> 04:24.018
I love Raj, but that's
a long time for a house guest.

04:24.020 --> 04:25.686
I know, but they're
tenting his building.

04:25.688 --> 04:28.072
He can't find a hotel
he likes that allows dogs.

04:28.074 --> 04:29.640
He's bringing Cinnamon?

04:29.642 --> 04:30.641
For a whole week!

04:30.643 --> 04:32.660
The nerve of some people.

04:35.197 --> 04:39.117
Here comes
the Embarrassment Express.

04:39.985 --> 04:42.587
With stops at Fraudville...

04:42.589 --> 04:45.089
WonderBlunderberg...

04:45.091 --> 04:48.042
and Kansas City.

04:48.044 --> 04:49.310
Because it's a hub.

04:51.815 --> 04:53.281
Sheldon, can I come in?

04:53.283 --> 04:54.932
Do you have cookies?
No.

04:54.934 --> 04:56.884
Good. I don't deserve cookies.
Come in.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.171
Wil...?

05:00.173 --> 05:01.105
Hey, Sheldon.

05:01.107 --> 05:02.023
It's been a while.

05:02.025 --> 05:03.524
Why are you here?

05:03.526 --> 05:04.559
Amy said you were
having a rough time,

05:04.561 --> 05:06.144
and I thought maybe
we could talk.

05:06.146 --> 05:07.011
Is that okay?

05:07.013 --> 05:08.646
Certainly.

05:08.648 --> 05:09.680
Although...

05:09.682 --> 05:11.232
right now,
I'm having a rough time

05:11.234 --> 05:12.900
because there's
three people in my room,

05:12.902 --> 05:15.920
and it's starting to feel
like a discotheque.

05:17.372 --> 05:19.574
Sheldon, you said you were
unhappy getting attention

05:19.576 --> 05:21.859
for something you wished
you never did.

05:21.861 --> 05:23.694
Yeah, I know a little
something about that.

05:23.696 --> 05:25.746
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

05:25.748 --> 05:29.300
Your endless tweets are
not that bad.

05:29.302 --> 05:31.719
I remember why
it's been a while.

05:31.721 --> 05:34.172
Sheldon, I was actually talking

05:34.174 --> 05:35.873
about when I was a kid
on <i>Star Trek.</i>

05:35.875 --> 05:38.392
How could you not
like getting attention

05:38.394 --> 05:39.877
for playing Wesley Crusher?

05:39.879 --> 05:41.996
You were wonderful.

05:41.998 --> 05:44.732
A know-it-all boy genius
with an eidetic memory.

05:44.734 --> 05:47.568
Who couldn't relate to that?

05:48.437 --> 05:50.238
Well, not everybody
felt that way.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.989
A lot of people
really hated the character,

05:51.991 --> 05:54.242
and some of them
hated me because of it.

05:54.244 --> 05:55.226
I would do interviews,

05:55.228 --> 05:56.894
and people would be mean to me.

05:56.896 --> 05:59.163
That just happened to me.

05:59.165 --> 06:00.915
Next time you're stuck
for a tweet,

06:00.917 --> 06:04.202
feel free to say
what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

06:04.204 --> 06:07.288
Sheldon, the point is
Wil learned to embrace

06:07.290 --> 06:10.574
that part of his life and moved
on to bigger and better things.

06:10.576 --> 06:12.076
Yeah, I'm an author now,

06:12.078 --> 06:13.628
I do public speaking,

06:13.630 --> 06:15.796
and I have my own Web series
about board games.

06:15.798 --> 06:17.181
Uh...

06:17.183 --> 06:19.050
We're trying
to cheer him up, so...

06:24.056 --> 06:26.023
I'm just saying
that there was a time

06:26.025 --> 06:28.526
when I thought I would never get
out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

06:28.528 --> 06:29.860
But now,

06:29.862 --> 06:32.313
it's just one small part
of a pretty great life,

06:32.315 --> 06:34.431
and it's a part
that I'm happy is there.

06:34.433 --> 06:36.734
I do see what you're saying.

06:36.736 --> 06:38.236
That helps.

06:38.238 --> 06:39.370
Good.

06:39.372 --> 06:40.605
Would you two like to stay

06:40.607 --> 06:41.639
and play trains with me?

06:41.641 --> 06:42.707
Sure.
Okay.

06:42.709 --> 06:43.774
Oh, great!

06:43.776 --> 06:47.111
Now...

06:47.113 --> 06:48.112
I work the controls.

06:48.114 --> 06:49.297
I say "All aboard""

06:49.299 --> 06:52.283
You sit quietly and watch.

06:52.285 --> 06:54.385
Can I blow the whistle?

06:55.754 --> 06:57.755
You should probably go.

07:05.314 --> 07:07.415
You're gonna brush
your teeth on my couch?

07:07.417 --> 07:10.568
No, I'm gonna brush
Cinnamon's teeth.

07:10.570 --> 07:11.686
Why bother?

07:11.688 --> 07:12.820
She spends half the time

07:12.822 --> 07:14.322
licking her butt.

07:15.274 --> 07:16.741
And the other half
licking my face.

07:16.743 --> 07:18.809
That's why I'm brushing
her teeth.

07:20.645 --> 07:22.646
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm so late.

07:22.648 --> 07:23.647
Did you already have dinner?

07:23.649 --> 07:25.249
No, we were waiting for you.

07:25.251 --> 07:26.500
Aw, that's so sweet.

07:26.502 --> 07:28.753
Yeah. So what do you
feel like making?

07:30.322 --> 07:31.505
Howard, the poor thing

07:31.507 --> 07:32.506
just got home from work.

07:32.508 --> 07:34.658
Let me get you a glass of wine.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.177
I'll cook dinner.

07:36.179 --> 07:38.129
- Oh, Raj, you're our guest.
- Don't be silly.

07:38.131 --> 07:40.164
Sit. You look
like you've had a long day.

07:40.166 --> 07:43.150
No, she always
looks like that.

07:45.554 --> 07:48.939
Because she married an idiot.

07:49.691 --> 07:51.592
Thank you, Raj.

07:51.594 --> 07:52.810
Please, this is

07:52.812 --> 07:54.528
my way of thanking you

07:54.530 --> 07:56.364
for letting me stay here.

07:56.366 --> 07:59.317
Now, tell us all about your day.

07:59.319 --> 08:01.319
Okay, um, well, first,

08:01.321 --> 08:03.287
I was late to a meeting
'cause I was stuck in traffic.

08:03.289 --> 08:06.290
Well, I keep telling you to put
that traffic app on your phone.

08:06.292 --> 08:08.192
Hey, when you got home today
complaining that you felt sick

08:08.194 --> 08:09.526
from eating
too many jelly beans,

08:09.528 --> 08:10.661
did I tell you how to fix it?

08:10.663 --> 08:11.862
No.

08:13.548 --> 08:17.534
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"
and I rubbed your belly.

08:20.872 --> 08:23.090
I thought of you
the whole time.

08:26.228 --> 08:28.179
All I'm saying is there's
a time to just listen.

08:28.181 --> 08:29.513
Thank you.

08:29.515 --> 08:30.598
There's also a time to stop

08:30.600 --> 08:31.682
eating too many jelly beans.

08:31.684 --> 08:33.851
And it's when you're ten.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.255
Hello, President Siebert.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.774
Thank you for taking my call.

08:39.775 --> 08:42.576
I just wanted you to know
that you can now expect

08:42.578 --> 08:46.414
enthusiastic participation
from me regarding my discovery.

08:46.416 --> 08:47.698
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.999
No need to thank me.

08:49.001 --> 08:51.786
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

08:51.788 --> 08:55.005
For your information,
I have nine friends, hmm?

08:56.208 --> 08:59.410
Ten if we include you.

08:59.412 --> 09:01.595
Nine it is.

09:04.182 --> 09:06.183
Ah, it's ten.

09:06.185 --> 09:08.018
I'll count Wolowitz.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.771
Hello, friend Leonard.

09:10.773 --> 09:12.056
Hey, you're in a good mood.

09:12.058 --> 09:14.024
I'm in a great mood.

09:14.026 --> 09:15.893
Well, you're about to be
in an even better one.

09:15.895 --> 09:17.261
I didn't want
to say anything

09:17.263 --> 09:18.646
until I knew for sure, but...

09:18.648 --> 09:21.365
I've been re-running the tests
on your element in my lab

09:21.367 --> 09:22.900
and I disproved it.

09:22.902 --> 09:24.702
Your element does not exist!

09:25.737 --> 09:27.471
Yeah, but what about
the Chinese research team?

09:27.473 --> 09:28.572
They found it.

09:28.574 --> 09:29.957
Yeah, it turns out someone added

09:29.959 --> 09:32.443
simulated signals
to the data files.

09:32.445 --> 09:34.128
They faked the results.

09:34.130 --> 09:35.129
Really?

09:35.131 --> 09:36.864
Yes! Do you know
what that means?

09:36.866 --> 09:39.884
That means all of this attention
that you hate goes away.

09:39.886 --> 09:41.118
So no more interviews?

09:41.120 --> 09:42.119
No, it's all over.

09:42.121 --> 09:43.220
I can't believe it.

09:43.222 --> 09:44.121
Well, you're welcome.

09:44.123 --> 09:45.122
You robbed me

09:45.124 --> 09:47.057
of my greatest achievement!

09:48.043 --> 09:49.009
What?!

09:49.011 --> 09:51.812
I'm back down
to nine friends!

09:51.814 --> 09:55.232
Make it eight--
I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

09:55.234 --> 09:57.735
I-I don't understand.

09:57.737 --> 09:59.353
All you've done
since you discovered

09:59.355 --> 10:00.771
this stupid element
was complain.

10:00.773 --> 10:02.106
I was trying to make you happy!

10:02.108 --> 10:04.742
By taking away
my only claim to fame?

10:04.744 --> 10:06.410
Well, if you wanted
to make me happy,

10:06.412 --> 10:07.828
you could have told me a joke.

10:07.830 --> 10:09.113
Or shown me a cute video

10:09.115 --> 10:11.148
of a koala and an otter

10:11.150 --> 10:12.649
becoming unlikely friends.

10:12.651 --> 10:16.036
Oh, there is
no winning with you.

10:16.038 --> 10:18.422
And koalas and otters don't
even live near each other!

10:18.424 --> 10:21.425
That's what makes
their friendship unlikely!

10:21.427 --> 10:23.043
Hey!

10:23.045 --> 10:24.345
What's with all the yelling?

10:24.347 --> 10:26.430
Leonard disproved my element.

10:26.432 --> 10:28.766
Now all the attention
is going to go away.

10:28.768 --> 10:30.267
Oh, that's great.
You must be thrilled!

10:30.269 --> 10:33.687
That's it!
I'm down to seven friends.

10:33.689 --> 10:37.391
He's counting hobbits
and superheroes, right?

10:37.393 --> 10:40.644
When I thought the element
was real, I didn't want it.

10:40.646 --> 10:42.480
But now that Leonard
made it not exist,

10:42.482 --> 10:44.982
I want it more
than anything in the world.

10:44.984 --> 10:46.567
The-the element never existed.

10:46.569 --> 10:48.352
I didn't take it away,
science took it away.

10:48.354 --> 10:49.453
Be mad at science.

10:49.455 --> 10:52.456
Don't you dare use
science against me.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.992
Science is my best friend!

10:54.994 --> 10:56.460
Oh, good,
I'm back up to eight.

10:57.829 --> 11:00.047
Will you tell him
he's out of his mind.

11:00.049 --> 11:01.348
Actually, I get
what he's saying.

11:01.350 --> 11:02.716
Oh, yes! Nine!

11:02.718 --> 11:03.717
Welcome back, buddy.

11:06.004 --> 11:08.038
It's like if you're dating
someone you're not that into,

11:08.040 --> 11:09.306
and then they break up with you

11:09.308 --> 11:10.724
and then you want them
more than ever.

11:10.726 --> 11:12.426
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

11:12.428 --> 11:15.813
but we're ganged up
on you so I agree.

11:16.714 --> 11:18.882
Okay, Sheldon, what do you
want me to do,

11:18.884 --> 11:20.484
hide the information?

11:20.486 --> 11:21.852
If I don't publish it,

11:21.854 --> 11:23.237
it's just a matter of time
before someone else does.

11:23.239 --> 11:25.022
No, no, of course
you have to publish.

11:25.024 --> 11:26.957
That's your responsibility
as a scientist.

11:26.959 --> 11:28.609
Doing otherwise
would be unethical.

11:28.611 --> 11:29.893
You have no choice.

11:29.895 --> 11:31.662
Fine, I'll publish.

11:31.664 --> 11:33.364
Can you believe this guy?

11:35.000 --> 11:41.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

11:43.480 --> 11:45.481
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

11:45.483 --> 11:47.033
How do you know
I didn't do them?

11:47.035 --> 11:48.768
Because once, when all
the knives were dirty,

11:48.770 --> 11:51.604
you cut a bagel with your keys.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.874
Good morning, everybody.

11:54.876 --> 11:57.009
I picked up coffee
while I was out.

11:57.011 --> 11:59.629
Bernadette, here's
your soy peppermint mocha.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.798
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.932
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry

12:02.934 --> 12:04.000
about your presentation today.

12:04.002 --> 12:05.218
You're gonna be great.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.420
Yeah, you're gonna
knock it out of the park.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.622
What presentation
do I have today?

12:11.058 --> 12:12.675
Just go.

12:16.013 --> 12:18.181
He loves you.

12:18.183 --> 12:19.148
What are you doing?

12:19.150 --> 12:20.600
Are you trying
to make me look bad?

12:20.602 --> 12:22.134
I'm just being
a good house guest.

12:22.136 --> 12:23.603
No, you're being
a better husband than I am.

12:23.605 --> 12:25.354
Doing the dishes,
getting coffee,

12:25.356 --> 12:26.572
knowing about her life--

12:26.574 --> 12:28.474
who does that?

12:28.476 --> 12:31.110
Oh, come on,
I brought you one, too.

12:31.112 --> 12:32.795
I don't want coffee.

12:32.797 --> 12:34.247
That's why I got you
hot chocolate.

12:34.249 --> 12:36.332
Give me that.

12:36.334 --> 12:39.035
Just stop showing me up.

12:39.037 --> 12:40.586
Howard, listen to me.

12:40.588 --> 12:41.987
You're a great husband.

12:41.989 --> 12:44.590
Yes, your listening skills
could use some work.

12:44.592 --> 12:47.794
But it's amazing how far
you've come given that you're

12:47.796 --> 12:51.264
an only child raised
by an over-protective mom.

12:51.266 --> 12:53.883
Um, is this getting weird?

12:53.885 --> 12:54.934
Hang on.

12:59.389 --> 13:02.225
So, yes.

13:03.393 --> 13:05.595
Hey.

13:05.597 --> 13:07.947
I just wanted to let you know
that I-I posted my findings.

13:07.949 --> 13:09.181
I saw.

13:09.183 --> 13:10.533
And I just

13:10.535 --> 13:12.618
posted a retraction of my paper.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.621
Now the whole scientific
community knows I was wrong.

13:15.623 --> 13:18.291
These things happen
all the time, Sheldon.

13:18.293 --> 13:19.458
Not to me.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.544
The only other retraction
I ever had to issue

13:21.546 --> 13:24.213
was when I was seven
and I conceded that my brother

13:24.215 --> 13:26.916
was the greatest ninja
in East Texas.

13:28.168 --> 13:30.449
But that was just a ploy to get
my face out of his armpit.

13:31.722 --> 13:34.056
There he is!

13:35.208 --> 13:36.809
It's my favorite superhero--

13:36.811 --> 13:39.595
the Retractor!

13:40.731 --> 13:43.399
Come on, don't give him
a hard time.

13:43.401 --> 13:44.684
I'm sorry, Cooper.

13:44.686 --> 13:46.886
I retract it.

13:47.821 --> 13:49.655
By the way, Hofstadter,

13:49.657 --> 13:52.191
nice job disproving
the Chinese team.

13:52.193 --> 13:53.276
It's not a big deal.

13:53.278 --> 13:54.911
It's a huge deal.

13:54.913 --> 13:57.897
Cooper, maybe physics
just isn't your thing.

13:58.899 --> 14:00.750
Have you ever considered
a career in retail?

14:00.752 --> 14:04.003
That way you could take
things back for a living.

14:05.455 --> 14:06.505
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

14:06.507 --> 14:07.907
Oh, no, that's okay.

14:07.909 --> 14:09.876
I can fight my own battles.

14:09.878 --> 14:12.962
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

14:14.581 --> 14:16.432
Is...?

14:16.434 --> 14:19.018
Is that a reference
to my speech impediment?

14:20.470 --> 14:23.055
That's pretty hurtful.

14:23.057 --> 14:24.473
I...

14:24.475 --> 14:26.475
I can't control it.

14:27.945 --> 14:29.028
You're right,

14:29.030 --> 14:31.063
That was uncalled for.

14:31.065 --> 14:32.481
I take it back.

14:32.483 --> 14:33.449
Of course you do.

14:33.451 --> 14:35.451
Because you're the Retractor!

14:39.823 --> 14:41.991
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

14:41.993 --> 14:43.108
If you're here much longer,

14:43.110 --> 14:45.127
I'm gonna have
to buy bigger clothes.

14:45.129 --> 14:46.111
Nonsense.

14:46.113 --> 14:47.296
You need
a little fattening up.

14:47.298 --> 14:49.281
You've been looking
too skinny lately.

14:49.283 --> 14:50.616
Aw.

14:50.618 --> 14:53.135
Howie, how come you never
say anything sweet like that?

14:53.137 --> 14:54.119
What are you talking about?

14:54.121 --> 14:55.338
Remember last week,
when I asked you

14:55.340 --> 14:56.722
if you were wearing Spanx
and you weren't?

14:56.724 --> 14:59.008
How's that different?

15:00.510 --> 15:02.011
Maybe you could try being
more thoughtful,

15:02.013 --> 15:03.629
like your friend Raj.

15:03.631 --> 15:06.148
Yeah, well, maybe you could
try being more like Raj.

15:06.150 --> 15:07.233
Oh, really?

15:07.235 --> 15:08.150
Yeah, yeah.

15:08.152 --> 15:09.568
He packed me
a lunch this morning.

15:09.570 --> 15:12.772
And there was a note inside
that said, "Go get 'em""

15:12.774 --> 15:15.358
Like I don't do enough
around here.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.659
Now I need
to pack your lunch?

15:16.661 --> 15:18.310
And by the way, why do you need
a note telling you

15:18.312 --> 15:19.745
to "go get 'em"?
You're a grown man!

15:19.747 --> 15:21.080
You should know to "go get 'em"!

15:21.982 --> 15:23.366
I do know to "go get 'em""

15:23.368 --> 15:25.051
but sometimes it's nice
to have emotional support

15:25.053 --> 15:27.486
when I'm going and getting them!

15:27.488 --> 15:29.922
Hey, hey, do you
hear yourselves?

15:29.924 --> 15:33.209
Let's just, you know, all calm
down and take a step back.

15:33.211 --> 15:35.311
This is stupid.

15:35.313 --> 15:36.512
Why are we fighting?

15:36.514 --> 15:37.546
I don't know.

15:37.548 --> 15:38.998
I guess I was just feeling

15:39.000 --> 15:40.833
like I'm a lousy husband.

15:40.835 --> 15:42.351
You're not a lousy husband.

15:42.353 --> 15:43.636
You're a great husband.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.888
I was the one feeling
like a lousy wife.

15:45.890 --> 15:48.140
Are you kidding?
You're the best.

15:48.142 --> 15:49.692
I know what the problem is.

15:49.694 --> 15:51.377
It's him!

15:52.195 --> 15:54.313
Oh, what did I do?

15:54.315 --> 15:56.682
You made us feel like we're
not trying hard enough.

15:56.684 --> 15:58.350
Yeah, we were totally fine
half-assing our marriage

15:58.352 --> 16:00.252
till you showed up.

16:00.254 --> 16:02.955
Look, I'm sorry
you're upset with me,

16:02.957 --> 16:04.657
but I just have to say
it's nice to see

16:04.659 --> 16:06.191
the two of you on the same page.

16:06.193 --> 16:07.860
Oh, it does feel good

16:07.862 --> 16:09.462
to have you backing
me up for once.

16:09.464 --> 16:11.779
I back you up all the time!
That is not...

16:11.780 --> 16:14.147
He's doing it again!
What is wrong with you?!

16:15.719 --> 16:17.420
I can't believe
they kicked you out.

16:17.422 --> 16:21.057
I can't believe
they're still married.

16:21.059 --> 16:24.560
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's
toothbrush at Howard's.

16:24.562 --> 16:27.313
I guess you're sharing
with Daddy again.

16:32.352 --> 16:34.737
Bark once if you need me
to call PETA.

16:37.607 --> 16:40.326
What's that animal doing
in our apartment?

16:40.328 --> 16:42.611
Oh, relax, she's in her crate.
She can't get out.

16:42.613 --> 16:44.330
I have two words for you:

16:44.332 --> 16:46.365
<i>Jurassic Park.</i>

16:46.367 --> 16:49.585
This day just keeps
getting worse and worse.

16:49.587 --> 16:51.120
You know, if it makes
you feel any better...

16:51.122 --> 16:52.088
It probably won't.

16:52.090 --> 16:53.205
You're probably right.

16:53.207 --> 16:56.258
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

16:56.260 --> 16:58.878
Why don't you and I
go for a nice walk together?

16:58.880 --> 17:01.430
Oh, everything is just sex
with you isn't it?

17:02.916 --> 17:05.518
Sheldon, I think
you might find the support

17:05.520 --> 17:07.086
you're looking for,
if you realize

17:07.088 --> 17:09.305
that relationships
are a give and take.

17:09.307 --> 17:10.756
She can only be there for you

17:10.758 --> 17:12.641
as much as you are for her.

17:12.643 --> 17:14.443
Thank you, Rajesh.

17:14.444 --> 17:16.762
And, Amy, you need
to be patient with Sheldon,

17:16.763 --> 17:20.483
instead of pressuring him to
accept intimacy on your terms.

17:21.434 --> 17:23.769
You should probably go.

17:33.391 --> 17:36.093
I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is <i>Science Friday.</i>

17:36.095 --> 17:38.195
I'd like to welcome back
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

17:38.197 --> 17:40.281
who thought
he had discovered

17:40.283 --> 17:43.033
a new super-heavy element
only to have it disproved

17:43.035 --> 17:45.486
by my next guest,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

17:45.488 --> 17:46.620
Welcome to <i>Science</i> Friday,
gentlemen.

17:46.622 --> 17:48.072
Thanks.
Thank you.

17:48.074 --> 17:50.708
Ira, if I may,
I'd like to apologize

17:50.710 --> 17:52.743
for my behavior last week.

17:52.745 --> 17:54.328
It's all right.

17:54.330 --> 17:57.715
Now, isn't there something
you'd like to say to me?

17:58.633 --> 18:00.668
No.

18:01.303 --> 18:03.170
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

18:03.172 --> 18:04.555
Can you walk us
through the process

18:04.557 --> 18:06.423
you used to disprove his theory?

18:06.425 --> 18:09.143
Well...
I believe I can answer that.

18:09.145 --> 18:11.095
He asked me.

18:11.097 --> 18:12.313
Fine.

18:12.315 --> 18:13.347
As I was saying...

18:13.349 --> 18:14.815
You're telling it wrong.
Ira...

18:14.817 --> 18:16.817
to really understand
the story here,

18:16.819 --> 18:18.402
you have to start
at the very beginning:

18:18.404 --> 18:21.438
A small town in East Texas,
where a young genius named...

18:21.440 --> 18:23.307
Sheldon...
That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

18:23.309 --> 18:26.577
He was bitten
by his neighbor's dog,

18:26.579 --> 18:28.495
leading to his first
scientific breakthrough--

18:28.497 --> 18:30.748
the doggie death-ray.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.117
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

18:33.119 --> 18:35.986
because Santa wouldn't bring him
enriched uranium.

18:35.988 --> 18:38.756
I mean, I'd really like
to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

18:38.758 --> 18:40.040
if it's okay with you.

18:40.042 --> 18:41.992
What a surprise.

18:41.994 --> 18:44.678
Did-did you invite me back
just so you could ignore me?

18:44.680 --> 18:46.513
Actually, I didn't invite you.

18:46.515 --> 18:47.998
You came in, you took a seat,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.018
and I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

18:52.637 --> 18:55.122
Sheldon, this interview
is supposed to be about me.

18:55.124 --> 18:57.324
Well, that seems like a snooze.

18:57.326 --> 19:00.094
Even for public radio.

19:00.096 --> 19:01.929
You know, if we did
a shot every time

19:01.931 --> 19:03.130
they said something
embarrassing,

19:03.132 --> 19:05.282
this would be one hell
of a drinking game.

19:05.284 --> 19:07.468
A little early
for alcohol, isn't it?

19:07.470 --> 19:09.353
You know, I don't just say smart
things about science.

19:09.355 --> 19:10.854
I also yodel.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.827
I'll get the vodka.

19:16.829 --> 19:21.829
