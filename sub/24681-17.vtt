00:01.748 --> 00:04.273
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.351 --> 00:06.410
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.486 --> 00:09.319
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.389 --> 00:11.050
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.393 --> 00:17.352
I had those two interviews,
but I haven't heard back.

00:17.864 --> 00:20.628
Well, in the meantime,
we'll keep looking.

00:20.701 --> 00:23.568
The meantime.
It's all the meantime.

00:24.304 --> 00:26.499
Keith, I tell all
my probationers,

00:26.573 --> 00:28.973
whatever's eating
at you, talk it out.

00:30.077 --> 00:32.375
Monsters only
live in the dark.

00:38.051 --> 00:39.951
...phone calls, you don't
make the appointments.

00:40.020 --> 00:42.887
You don't get appointments,
you don't make any money.

00:42.956 --> 00:44.514
Be right there.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

00:55.469 --> 00:57.232
Service door, Frank.

01:05.078 --> 01:06.943
No. No, I won't.

01:09.349 --> 01:10.976
I promise. Hello?

01:20.627 --> 01:27.032
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it.

01:27.834 --> 01:29.859
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

01:29.936 --> 01:30.960
Stop it.

01:31.037 --> 01:32.163
Phoebe,
don't do this.

01:32.239 --> 01:33.399
Don't.

01:34.641 --> 01:35.801
Phoebe.

01:35.876 --> 01:40.745
Don't act familiar at work. Don't
get to the apartment before 9:00.

01:40.814 --> 01:42.475
Don't let anybody see you.

01:42.549 --> 01:44.073
Not this again.

01:45.786 --> 01:47.754
I want things to change.

01:49.856 --> 01:51.949
You're not
being realistic.

01:57.264 --> 01:58.288
So?

02:02.702 --> 02:03.794
Fine.

02:23.924 --> 02:25.414
911, what is your emergency?

02:25.492 --> 02:27.016
<i>She's not breathing.</i>

02:27.093 --> 02:28.253
What is your
location, sir?

02:28.328 --> 02:30.990
<i>Send someone to 90...
Wait, wait.</i>

02:32.666 --> 02:37.831
<i>Stop! I can't...
Don't kill me.</i>

02:37.904 --> 02:39.701
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

02:42.042 --> 02:46.103
<i>Now she's not breathing.
So that's 90 Rector Place</i>

02:46.179 --> 02:49.478
<i>in Battery Park City,
Apartment 408.</i>

02:50.016 --> 02:51.881
<i>Phoebe Morton is dead.</i>

03:42.135 --> 03:45.070
The 911 call was made from
her cell. Name's Phoebe Morton.

03:45.138 --> 03:46.264
Whose name
is on the lease?

03:46.339 --> 03:49.638
A Mr. Paul Riddick, with a
business address over on East 15th.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.370
Stove's never been used,
fridge is empty.

03:51.444 --> 03:54.174
I'm guessing hookups are
the specialty of the house.

03:54.247 --> 03:56.408
Any witnesses to the
comings and goings tonight?

03:56.483 --> 03:58.383
Not yet. We're walking on eggshells.

03:58.451 --> 04:00.681
Couple of biggies from City Hall
have their girlfriends stashed here.

04:00.754 --> 04:03.279
Well, break all the eggshells
you want, that's why we're here.

04:05.091 --> 04:06.991
Cheap business suit.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.221
Her lingerie
is more expensive.

04:09.296 --> 04:11.594
She wanted to impress somebody.

04:11.665 --> 04:13.997
Petechial hemorrhaging is severe.

04:14.701 --> 04:16.692
What do you
make of this?

04:17.303 --> 04:18.601
I'm not sure.

04:18.672 --> 04:22.665
Her arms were tied behind her
back, at the elbows and the wrists.

04:23.610 --> 04:26.909
And then there's
this ligature mark.

04:26.980 --> 04:28.379
It's on only one
of her ankles.

04:28.448 --> 04:31.349
He might've tied her leg to
something to keep her in one place.

04:31.418 --> 04:34.319
Yeah, but nothing
is heavy enough.

04:40.794 --> 04:42.193
It's bleach.

04:42.529 --> 04:44.656
Someone cleaned
off a stain.

04:49.102 --> 04:50.535
He sat here.

04:52.405 --> 04:53.963
He watched her
tied up on the floor,

04:54.040 --> 04:59.034
and then when he decided it was
time to kill her, he called 911.

04:59.112 --> 05:00.875
Well, we should go
wake up Mr. Riddick,

05:00.947 --> 05:03.575
see if he enjoyed
the floor show.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.715
Go back to bed, honey.
I'll be up in a minute.

05:09.789 --> 05:11.313
Okay, sweetie.

05:12.125 --> 05:16.494
So you and Phoebe.

05:17.497 --> 05:19.294
How long, how often?

05:21.034 --> 05:24.470
Eight months, once, maybe twice a week.

05:24.738 --> 05:26.569
You see her
last night?

05:26.640 --> 05:31.703
Yes. We ended up arguing.
I left. I didn't kill her.

05:32.245 --> 05:34.372
What'd you
argue about?

05:34.447 --> 05:36.210
She wanted to change
the ground rules.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.012
Was she threatening
to tell your wife?

05:38.084 --> 05:39.984
No. No, it hadn't
come to that.

05:40.053 --> 05:41.680
Anyone else know
about the affair?

05:41.755 --> 05:45.282
No, nobody knew, not even at
work. We were very, very discreet.

05:45.358 --> 05:47.588
Phoebe'd leave first,
then I'd drive over,

05:47.661 --> 05:50.391
and call her when I got there,
to tell her to come up.

05:50.463 --> 05:52.658
You made her wait
out in the cold?

05:52.732 --> 05:57.328
Well, get dressed, Galahad, we're taking
you downtown, get some DNA samples.

05:58.171 --> 06:00.799
She was choked within an
inch of her life several times

06:00.874 --> 06:02.569
before she was finally
choked to death.

06:02.642 --> 06:06.100
We found a piece of blue nylon
rope embedded in her neck.

06:06.179 --> 06:08.511
Nylon makes for
a good slipknot.

06:10.183 --> 06:14.552
Okay. So he was behind her.

06:16.690 --> 06:21.684
Pulling. Now, he would have had to put
a hand or a knee on her to keep her down.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.560
No, but there would have
been marks left on her.

06:26.633 --> 06:28.726
Which aren't here.

06:28.802 --> 06:31.293
Now, what about
this ligature mark?

06:32.272 --> 06:35.469
It pulls in a downward
direction, toward the heel.

06:57.897 --> 07:04.700
Well, now it pulls up.
Towards her neck.

07:05.338 --> 07:08.432
He tied the rope to her ankle
and looped it around her neck.

07:08.508 --> 07:11.841
While she kept her leg
tensed up, she'd be all right.

07:11.911 --> 07:15.074
But if she relaxed it,
the rope would tighten.

07:15.915 --> 07:18.349
It would start
choking her.

07:18.418 --> 07:21.148
Till she brought
it back up again.

07:21.354 --> 07:24.619
Back and forth, until she
couldn't hold her leg up anymore.

07:25.792 --> 07:28.488
There's no evidence
of sexual assault,

07:28.561 --> 07:29.755
there's no semen
in or out.

07:29.829 --> 07:34.630
On the other hand, forensics
found seminal fluid in four places

07:34.701 --> 07:37.192
in the living room,
including the couch.

07:37.270 --> 07:39.101
Different individuals?

07:39.172 --> 07:42.369
Well, the samples were
extremely degraded by bleach.

07:42.442 --> 07:46.538
The DNA lab could only develop
5 of 13 loci for identification.

07:46.613 --> 07:53.109
But the samples are all from the same
individual, and it's not your Mr. Riddick.

07:56.356 --> 07:58.984
Semen was found in
each of these locations.

07:59.058 --> 08:03.722
Each position offered the killer
a clear sight line of Phoebe.

08:03.797 --> 08:05.958
While she struggled
to stay alive.

08:06.032 --> 08:07.659
Her struggle
excited him.

08:07.734 --> 08:10.032
He masturbated to orgasm at each spot.

08:10.103 --> 08:12.230
Then cleaned up
with bleach.

08:12.405 --> 08:15.033
He would've made
his last stand here.

08:16.242 --> 08:21.373
After he cleaned up,
he called 911.

08:22.015 --> 08:23.505
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

08:23.583 --> 08:25.141
<i>She's not breathing.</i>

08:25.218 --> 08:26.378
<i>What is your
location, sir?</i>

08:26.452 --> 08:28.977
<i>Send someone to 90...
Wait, wait.</i>

08:30.123 --> 08:35.561
<i>Stop! I can't...
Don't kill me.</i>

08:35.628 --> 08:37.152
He revived her.

08:38.231 --> 08:42.725
He wanted the operator
to hear her beg.

08:43.001 --> 08:46.563
<i>Battery Park City,
Apartment 408.</i>

08:46.639 --> 08:48.504
<i>Phoebe Morton is dead.</i>

08:49.142 --> 08:53.044
No panic. He was
proud of himself.

08:53.213 --> 08:57.411
He should be. A five-loci DNA
sample's not enough to convict anyone.

08:57.483 --> 09:00.350
Well, he wanted us
to know how good he is.

09:00.420 --> 09:05.323
If he thinks that we're not
paying attention, he'll contact us.

09:07.026 --> 09:09.187
You suggesting
a leak to the media?

09:09.262 --> 09:11.958
And deprive him
of credit for the kill.

09:32.819 --> 09:34.480
He took the bait.

09:42.662 --> 09:45.028
And that would
be proof of authorship?

09:45.098 --> 09:49.194
It's another girl. New Jersey
license for a Marcia Waverly.

09:51.738 --> 09:56.141
Okay,
DOB is 3l15l67.

09:57.744 --> 09:59.837
"Marcia Waverly,
found murdered

09:59.913 --> 10:03.371
"in her apartment
in Hoboken in June, 1996.

10:03.449 --> 10:06.714
"No arrest made. " There's
a photo of the crime scene.

10:08.354 --> 10:10.117
Same
ligature marks.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.259
It can't be.

10:17.430 --> 10:20.422
BBJ. Type in
"Body By Jake. "

10:23.736 --> 10:27.172
"Body By Jake, nickname
adopted by unknown suspect

10:27.240 --> 10:29.708
"in strangulation murders of
four women in New York City

10:29.776 --> 10:32.711
"between 1989 and 1992.

10:33.079 --> 10:36.014
"The suspect sent a series of
taunting letters to the police.

10:36.082 --> 10:39.609
"His last communication
was in November, 1992."

10:39.986 --> 10:44.480
His first victim was an aerobics
instructor, that's where he got the name.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.624
After the killings stopped,
the investigators assumed

10:46.693 --> 10:49.787
it was because he either
died or went to jail.

10:50.496 --> 10:52.691
Wherever he was,
he's back.

10:59.205 --> 11:01.673
The MO matched
Phoebe Morton's to a T,

11:01.741 --> 11:03.902
right down to the blue nylon rope.

11:04.410 --> 11:08.574
The murder in New Jersey. Why was
it never ascribed to Body By Jake?

11:09.615 --> 11:11.549
Jake didn't take credit
for it at the time.

11:11.617 --> 11:13.380
The folks in Hoboken
never made the connection.

11:13.453 --> 11:15.444
After the second
victim was found,

11:15.521 --> 11:17.955
he sent the police a letter
with the driver's license

11:18.024 --> 11:19.889
of the first victim,
Kelly Erndale.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.288
He also included a Polaroid
of the second victim,

11:24.364 --> 11:26.457
Lisa Welsh,
taken at the scene.

11:26.532 --> 11:29.899
The only known photo of a Jake victim
with gag and ligatures in place.

11:29.969 --> 11:31.561
After each of the next two murders,

11:31.637 --> 11:34.197
he sent a letter with the
victim's driver's license.

11:34.273 --> 11:35.865
But not after
the Hoboken murder.

11:35.942 --> 11:37.603
Why wouldn't he
want credit for it?

11:37.677 --> 11:41.670
To keep it his secret.
It's his favorite kill.

11:42.181 --> 11:44.547
So now we have
six Jake victims.

11:44.617 --> 11:47.313
Do we know why and how
they were targeted?

11:48.488 --> 11:51.582
They're all Caucasian,
slender builds, long dark hair.

11:51.657 --> 11:53.887
But they all lived,
worked and died

11:53.960 --> 11:55.951
in different boroughs,
different neighborhoods.

11:56.029 --> 11:58.862
None of them knew each other
or had people in common.

11:58.931 --> 12:01.024
Any suggestions to find Jake?

12:01.100 --> 12:03.762
Well, he likes
to talk about himself.

12:03.836 --> 12:05.326
"Can you stop me
before I kill again?

12:05.405 --> 12:07.464
"Are you enjoying
this as much as I am?"

12:07.540 --> 12:09.735
We keep him talking with
another leak to the press.

12:09.809 --> 12:12.300
He left ejaculate
at the scene of the crimes.

12:12.378 --> 12:13.777
He was flaunting
his sexual power.

12:13.846 --> 12:18.340
Now, if we suggest he kills because
he can't get a woman to sleep with him,

12:19.152 --> 12:21.143
we'll provoke
a response.

12:27.260 --> 12:32.425
Hi. Oh, sorry, I had to stay late
at work. My boss spazzed on me.

12:33.032 --> 12:35.398
Oh, wait, I think
the super left a note.

12:35.468 --> 12:37.766
Yeah, he was supposed
to fix the sink.

12:39.472 --> 12:41.372
Listen to what
this creep wrote!

12:41.441 --> 12:44.103
"Oh, Cassandra,
why are you so late?

12:44.177 --> 12:46.577
"Oh, Cassandra, why
do you make me wait?"

12:46.646 --> 12:47.635
I'm not...

12:51.918 --> 12:53.977
I'm usually
home by 7:00.

12:54.053 --> 12:55.543
What if he'd
still been here?

12:55.621 --> 12:57.782
You don't want
to think about that.

12:57.857 --> 13:00.291
You notice anybody following
you or watching your place?

13:00.359 --> 13:02.327
No, no, nothing.

13:02.395 --> 13:06.832
Excuse me, the bra and
panties, are they yours?

13:06.899 --> 13:09.459
Yes. I can't stay here.

13:09.802 --> 13:11.531
Is there somebody
you can call?

13:11.604 --> 13:15.233
My friend in White
Plains, I can go there.

13:15.308 --> 13:17.538
That's good.
Call your friend.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.573
Lucky girl.

13:24.517 --> 13:26.314
"They spread lies.
They spread lies.

13:26.385 --> 13:29.183
"Willing or not,
Jake always has a mate. "

13:30.123 --> 13:33.923
<i>You provoked him all right. That jab in
The Ledger this morning did the trick.</i>

13:33.993 --> 13:36.257
Almost provoked him
into another murder.

13:36.329 --> 13:39.025
Jake doesn't need
provocation for that.

13:42.401 --> 13:45.199
"Willing or not,
Jake always has a mate. "

13:46.739 --> 13:49.173
I wonder if any
of Jake's mates

13:49.242 --> 13:51.608
ever filed a complaint
for sexual assault.

13:52.945 --> 13:54.344
I told that
doctor in the E.R.

13:54.413 --> 13:56.472
That my boyfriend had
nothing to do with it!

13:56.549 --> 13:57.982
It was just
an accident!

13:58.050 --> 14:00.746
I see. You accidentally
dislocated your shoulder.

14:00.820 --> 14:04.813
Same as you accidentally got
ligature marks on your wrist,

14:04.891 --> 14:06.722
your left ankle
and around your neck?

14:06.792 --> 14:07.781
What does it matter?

14:07.860 --> 14:09.885
It was over a year ago, and
all Keith got was probation.

14:09.962 --> 14:11.691
You didn't testify.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.324
Were you too
embarrassed?

14:16.903 --> 14:19.167
The report said
you were at his place,

14:19.238 --> 14:21.103
you'd both taken
ecstasy, and...

14:21.174 --> 14:25.008
This is what we think. He asked
you to pose for him, face down

14:25.444 --> 14:28.140
on the floor in your bra and underwear.

14:29.582 --> 14:31.516
He put a gag
in your mouth,

14:31.584 --> 14:34.314
tied your wrists behind
your back, am I right so far?

14:34.387 --> 14:38.255
Except for the bra. I don't
wear one. He gave me one.

14:38.791 --> 14:42.488
Then he tied your left
ankle with the rope

14:42.562 --> 14:44.462
and he looped it
around your neck.

14:44.530 --> 14:48.261
There was a struggle, and you
dislocated your shoulder, right?

14:48.334 --> 14:50.859
He was begging me
to let him finish.

14:52.405 --> 14:56.739
He kept telling me he wasn't gonna
hurt me, but he was just begging me.

15:00.746 --> 15:03.408
Now you saw him
last week, on a Tuesday.

15:03.482 --> 15:05.973
Did he seem tense
or distracted?

15:06.919 --> 15:10.320
No more than usual. Something's
always eating at him.

15:11.257 --> 15:13.953
He used to remind me of
that guy in the space movie,

15:14.026 --> 15:17.120
where that thing came
popping out of his chest?

15:18.631 --> 15:21.361
Keith get
himself in trouble?

15:21.434 --> 15:25.234
This woman was found murdered
Tuesday night. See the ligature marks?

15:25.304 --> 15:27.829
Same as Keith's girlfriend.
She even looks like her.

15:27.907 --> 15:30.671
He was in the service
from '93 to '96.

15:30.743 --> 15:32.608
That puts him in town
for the Hoboken thing.

15:32.678 --> 15:33.667
There's another one?

15:33.746 --> 15:34.872
There are five other ones.

15:34.947 --> 15:36.539
We wanna bring him in,
search his place,

15:36.616 --> 15:38.550
anything you can
violate him on?

15:38.618 --> 15:42.816
He had a dirty urine sample
six weeks ago for marijuana.

15:42.888 --> 15:44.116
I cut him a break.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.885
Well, his break's over.

15:45.958 --> 15:48.392
We also want you to call
him, check in with him.

15:48.461 --> 15:50.361
We'll be recording you.

15:50.930 --> 15:52.795
What do his activities
from last Tuesday night

15:52.865 --> 15:54.856
have to do with
a positive drug test?

15:54.934 --> 15:56.424
Let's put the cards
on the table, Detectives.

15:56.502 --> 16:00.336
Cards? We can put cards on the
table. You remember these cards?

16:00.406 --> 16:01.430
You gave them
to your girlfriend.

16:01.507 --> 16:04.840
Mr. Durbin no longer engages
in this offense behavior.

16:04.910 --> 16:06.605
Not just a little
fantasizing?

16:06.679 --> 16:08.374
No. It's not healthy.

16:08.447 --> 16:13.908
But keeping these bras and panties in
a box under your bed, that's healthy?

16:13.986 --> 16:15.681
He's admitted
all of this at his allocution.

16:15.755 --> 16:17.985
But he left out
the part about tying

16:18.057 --> 16:20.924
her left ankle to a
rope around her neck.

16:21.994 --> 16:25.430
Is this the effect that you were
going for, something like this?

16:27.199 --> 16:28.188
What is this?

16:28.267 --> 16:30.064
It's what
he finds exciting.

16:30.136 --> 16:31.865
No, it's repulsive.

16:32.171 --> 16:38.110
No, see, she's relaxing her leg, and
the noose is tightening around her neck.

16:38.177 --> 16:40.338
No! I don't
like this at all.

16:40.413 --> 16:42.381
I'm supposed to meet my family
tonight. I have to call them.

16:55.127 --> 16:57.322
I noticed
12 distinct similarities

16:57.396 --> 17:00.422
between the 911 caller and
your voice sample of Mr. Durbin,

17:00.499 --> 17:02.467
the most unique of which
was the manner in which words

17:02.535 --> 17:04.662
with "T's" in the middle
were pronounced.

17:04.737 --> 17:05.896
"Battery, city"?

17:05.971 --> 17:09.098
Yes, see, most speakers
articulate the "T" as a "D" sound.

17:09.175 --> 17:12.269
But in both samples, the speaker
articulates the "T" sound.

17:12.345 --> 17:15.075
"Battery, city. "
A shibboleth.

17:15.146 --> 17:16.910
It's not
a positive ID,

17:16.982 --> 17:19.883
but the 911 caller and Mr.
Durbin are a probable match.

17:25.624 --> 17:27.147
You do like it.

17:27.326 --> 17:29.794
You haven't taken your eyes
off it since we left the room.

17:29.862 --> 17:31.056
No, that's not true.

17:31.130 --> 17:32.597
Are you cold?

17:33.699 --> 17:35.291
Or are you
hiding something?

17:35.368 --> 17:36.392
Detective.

17:37.937 --> 17:41.304
You're aroused. This
picture, it arouses you.

17:41.374 --> 17:42.636
That's what you're hiding. No.

17:42.708 --> 17:45.700
Is it exciting for you
to see women like this?

17:47.079 --> 17:51.140
And like this, this, this, this, this...

17:51.217 --> 17:54.482
No! It's not me!
I can't...

17:55.187 --> 18:00.784
I can't help the way I feel. I
can't stop it. I can't stop it.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.487
Keith, that's enough. I'll say.

18:02.561 --> 18:05.359
As of now, he's under arrest
on five counts of murder.

18:05.431 --> 18:08.093
No! No!
It's just in my head.

18:08.434 --> 18:11.028
I can't stop it.
I can't...

18:12.004 --> 18:14.939
I can't stop it.
I...

18:17.510 --> 18:20.343
We got a five-point
match on Durbin's DNA.

18:20.813 --> 18:22.303
One in a thousand
chance it's him.

18:22.381 --> 18:25.214
That and a probable voice
match don't impress.

18:25.284 --> 18:27.115
Here's one court-appointed psychologist

18:27.186 --> 18:28.448
whose contract
should be re-examined.

18:28.521 --> 18:31.820
Dr. Elliot Burnhardt told the
court that, in his opinion,

18:31.891 --> 18:35.884
Mr. Durbin presented no danger
to the city's female population.

18:38.230 --> 18:42.223
The court ordered Mr. Durbin to
undergo 12 sessions with Dr. Burnhardt.

18:43.169 --> 18:45.296
But last week, with
three sessions to go,

18:45.371 --> 18:49.364
Burnhardt took Mr. Durbin
on as a private patient.

18:49.442 --> 18:50.966
Meaning everything
that Durbin tells him

18:51.043 --> 18:53.534
is covered by doctor-patient privilege.

18:53.612 --> 18:55.443
Well, this started
with the session

18:55.514 --> 18:59.951
Durbin had two days
after Phoebe's murder.

19:00.019 --> 19:02.385
He might've told the shrink
something about the murder.

19:02.455 --> 19:06.289
Something that contradicted
his rosy psych evaluation.

19:07.793 --> 19:12.389
Maybe Burnhardt turned Keith into a
private patient to protect himself.

19:12.698 --> 19:15.690
I'll ask him. In front
of the grand jury.

19:20.439 --> 19:23.237
After Mr. Durbin pled guilty to assault,

19:23.309 --> 19:26.506
I was asked to prepare
a psychological evaluation.

19:27.112 --> 19:30.639
I felt then that Mr. Durbin
posed no danger to women.

19:31.350 --> 19:33.147
I still believe that.

19:33.219 --> 19:36.450
Let's talk about your session two
days after Phoebe Morton's murder.

19:36.522 --> 19:40.481
I can't. Mr. Durbin became
my private patient that day.

19:40.993 --> 19:42.824
Doctor-patient
privilege attached,

19:42.895 --> 19:45.159
his sessions
became confidential.

19:46.765 --> 19:50.223
Only the patient can waive
privilege, isn't that right?

19:50.669 --> 19:55.231
If he chose to, Mr. Durbin could
tell us what he said to you that day.

19:58.310 --> 19:59.402
Yes.

19:59.678 --> 20:02.977
Lf, in the future, Mr. Durbin
confesses he killed Ms. Morton,

20:03.048 --> 20:05.778
he could reveal he made
an admission to you,

20:05.851 --> 20:08.046
one that makes your evaluation of him

20:08.120 --> 20:11.317
as posing no danger
to women seem incompetent.

20:11.557 --> 20:14.287
Unless, of course, the
information came from you

20:14.360 --> 20:16.521
before Mr. Durbin
confesses.

20:16.595 --> 20:18.256
But I can't
violate privilege.

20:18.330 --> 20:20.195
An argument
can be made

20:20.266 --> 20:24.396
that anything Mr. Durbin told you
is part of court-ordered therapy,

20:24.770 --> 20:27.102
not subject
to confidentiality.

20:28.741 --> 20:29.799
It could be
viewed that way.

20:29.875 --> 20:32.810
I'm asking you
to view it that way.

20:36.448 --> 20:40.009
During that session, two days
after Ms. Morton's murder,

20:40.653 --> 20:44.612
did Mr. Durbin say
anything about Ms. Morton?

20:48.227 --> 20:50.559
He saw the newspaper on my desk

20:51.030 --> 20:54.488
with a photo of Ms. Morton.
He said, "That could be me. "

20:54.567 --> 20:58.469
Did you think he meant he himself
could be the murder victim?

20:58.537 --> 21:01.506
No. I knew right away
he meant the killer.

21:02.708 --> 21:05.370
Keith has always been
filled with foreboding

21:05.444 --> 21:09.403
that his sexual issues would
inevitably lead to serious trouble.

21:10.649 --> 21:13.049
At that moment,
it occurred to me

21:13.452 --> 21:16.819
what he'd been trying to
tell me during our sessions.

21:17.122 --> 21:21.388
That he felt himself
fated to kill.

21:25.831 --> 21:27.628
I never forced Talia.

21:28.367 --> 21:32.827
She freaked out and got caught in
the rope, and wrenched her shoulder.

21:34.373 --> 21:37.672
I never meant to hurt her.
I never hurt anyone.

21:37.743 --> 21:41.839
You tried to put a slipknot around
her neck, but not to choke her?

21:42.381 --> 21:45.646
It's the idea of it.

21:46.185 --> 21:49.552
The idea of choking
a woman excites you.

21:49.622 --> 21:53.615
No, it's just the way
a woman looks like that.

21:53.692 --> 21:56.661
On her stomach, bound and
gagged, in her bra and panties?

21:56.729 --> 21:59.323
White bra and panties,
they should be white.

21:59.398 --> 22:01.263
Right, with her right
ankle tied to her neck...

22:01.333 --> 22:03.563
No, it's her left ankle.

22:05.971 --> 22:09.907
Yes, my mistake. Your way
of doing things is unique.

22:11.677 --> 22:15.340
Dr. Burnhardt testified when you
saw Ms. Morton in the newspaper,

22:15.414 --> 22:17.348
you said,
"That could be me. "

22:17.416 --> 22:21.682
I wanted to explain that I
meant, if I wasn't in therapy,

22:22.087 --> 22:25.113
if I didn't have self-control,
bad things could happen.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.090
You could be that killer.
That's what you meant,

22:27.159 --> 22:28.251
you could lose control.

22:28.327 --> 22:30.192
I won't lose control.
Dr. Burnhardt testified

22:30.262 --> 22:31.820
you were filled
with foreboding,

22:31.897 --> 22:33.888
you felt fated
to kill someday.

22:33.966 --> 22:34.955
I won't ever
let that happen.

22:35.034 --> 22:37.730
Where do you get that sense
of yourself as a killer?

22:41.907 --> 22:43.841
I don't know. Do you have
fantasies about killing?

22:43.909 --> 22:45.035
No, no, I don't.

22:45.110 --> 22:47.738
Then what is the source
of your apprehension?

22:47.813 --> 22:50.577
Mr. Durbin, it must
come from somewhere.

22:50.683 --> 22:54.119
I can't. I don't know, I don't know.

22:56.188 --> 22:58.418
You don't have
to answer anymore.

22:59.992 --> 23:02.859
I don't want to answer
any more questions.

23:02.928 --> 23:05.658
There's no need,
Mr. Durbin. Thank you.

23:07.266 --> 23:09.757
This, his
testimony here,

23:09.835 --> 23:13.566
when he specified the bra
and panties should be white,

23:13.639 --> 23:16.767
none of his victims wore
white bra and panties.

23:16.842 --> 23:17.831
Luck of the draw.

23:17.910 --> 23:20.105
Except he's very rigid
in his preferences.

23:20.179 --> 23:23.774
He made his victims undress. It
wouldn't have required much more effort

23:23.849 --> 23:26.818
to ask them to put on
a white bra and panties.

23:26.885 --> 23:29.752
All the lingerie we found
in his apartment was white.

23:29.822 --> 23:34.657
And here, when you said right
ankle, instead of left, you...

23:35.094 --> 23:37.085
You made a mistake,
and he let it pass.

23:37.162 --> 23:38.925
No, he corrected me.

23:39.598 --> 23:42.761
Without ridiculing you. You
know, the Jake in the letters,

23:42.835 --> 23:45.133
he would have berated
you for incompetence.

23:46.739 --> 23:49.173
Your sense of timing,
Detective...

23:50.042 --> 23:52.237
We might have
made a mistake.

23:55.147 --> 23:59.049
Grand jury disagrees. Indicted
Durbin on five counts of murder.

24:30.749 --> 24:33.741
I just got the "proceed with
caution" signal from the Captain.

24:33.819 --> 24:36.185
Once the DA has a
suspect in their mitts,

24:36.255 --> 24:38.280
they don't like
giving him up.

24:38.357 --> 24:41.451
Look, the third victim,
Christina Paulen,

24:41.527 --> 24:43.461
she changed jobs three
months before her murder.

24:43.529 --> 24:46.965
She used to work on Spring.
She would take the D Train

24:47.032 --> 24:51.469
down to West 4th and
change for the C to Spring.

24:51.937 --> 24:54.929
She changed at the
West 4th Street station.

24:55.407 --> 24:57.170
The same as the first two victims.

24:57.242 --> 25:00.769
But the fourth victim, Darlene
Jorif, she drove to work.

25:08.353 --> 25:11.516
She bought her car a month
before she was killed.

25:13.058 --> 25:15.253
Well, if she used
to take the subway,

25:15.327 --> 25:19.229
she would have been transferring
at West 4th to get to work.

25:21.266 --> 25:24.064
Why Marcia Waverly? She took
the PATH train from New Jersey.

25:24.136 --> 25:26.502
Now, she would have transferred
at West 4th to get up to Lexington.

25:26.572 --> 25:30.668
You see, that's where he picked
up their scent, at West 4th.

25:31.043 --> 25:33.978
He followed them,
he learned their schedules,

25:34.046 --> 25:35.411
and when he was
ready, he struck.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.540
Another commuter
or a Transit Authority worker.

25:39.017 --> 25:40.541
Cassandra Darcy,
our near miss,

25:40.619 --> 25:43.645
she transfers at the 14th
Street station to get to work.

25:43.722 --> 25:46.213
That leaves Phoebe
out in the cold.

25:46.959 --> 25:48.051
But the night
she was killed,

25:48.126 --> 25:49.957
she filled her MetroCard
at the 14th Street station,

25:50.028 --> 25:52.792
and that's how she got to
Battery Park. She took the subway.

25:52.865 --> 25:55.129
West 4th Street,
14th Street,

25:55.200 --> 25:58.727
match up the dates to her work
history, maybe we get a suspect.

26:01.974 --> 26:03.532
Do you have any idea
how many people pass

26:03.609 --> 26:05.600
through this station
any given day? It's a lot.

26:05.677 --> 26:08.475
There was somebody else working
with you that night, a Frank...

26:08.547 --> 26:11.175
McNare, Frank McNare. Frank!

26:11.750 --> 26:15.186
Now, there's one who might
remember. He notices things.

26:16.288 --> 26:19.052
Hey, Frank, they're asking about
a girl murdered in Battery Park

26:19.124 --> 26:21.092
a couple of weeks ago.
She was in the station.

26:21.159 --> 26:23.127
You remember
seeing her?

26:25.530 --> 26:28.829
I was wondering when you'd
get around to talking with us.

26:28.901 --> 26:32.803
Yeah. I recognized her when I
saw her picture in the newspaper.

26:34.273 --> 26:36.400
You noticed her
that night?

26:36.842 --> 26:40.801
There's not much else to do down
here but notice the pretty girls.

26:40.879 --> 26:45.316
I saw her, I said to myself,
"That is a pretty girl. "

26:45.384 --> 26:48.353
Do you remember anybody
talking to her or following her?

26:48.420 --> 26:51.685
No. But she got a phone
call just before she left.

26:53.425 --> 26:55.757
Maybe we should be
writing this down.

26:55.827 --> 26:56.816
Good idea.

26:59.064 --> 27:02.761
You said that she got a phone
call just before she left.

27:03.268 --> 27:04.257
Right.

27:04.336 --> 27:06.270
And did you see
anyone following her?

27:06.738 --> 27:09.332
Your partner already
asked me that.

27:09.408 --> 27:11.501
You know, you should
write down your questions

27:11.576 --> 27:13.840
and mark them off
as you ask them.

27:13.912 --> 27:16.403
That way you won't
repeat yourself.

27:17.916 --> 27:19.349
Good idea.

27:19.418 --> 27:21.648
We gotta go.
Shift's changing.

27:25.390 --> 27:27.915
Arrogant would be
an understatement.

27:30.262 --> 27:31.752
"Pretty girls. "

27:34.399 --> 27:38.426
He articulates his "T's,"
just like the 911 caller.

27:39.471 --> 27:42.907
It's a pronunciation
idiosyncrasy.

27:42.975 --> 27:46.672
It's picked up by children
when they learn to talk.

27:47.879 --> 27:49.642
Children like Keith.

27:49.881 --> 27:51.576
Frank, he had
red sideburns,

27:51.650 --> 27:55.518
got brown hair and a red
beard, just like Keith.

27:57.189 --> 27:59.749
It's unusual,
and it's genetic.

27:59.825 --> 28:01.554
It's passed on
from father to son.

28:02.728 --> 28:04.719
We just met
Keith's dad.

28:10.035 --> 28:14.495
Frank McNare divorced Keith's
mother in 1978, when Keith was eight.

28:14.573 --> 28:16.632
They were living
up in New Rochelle.

28:16.708 --> 28:20.269
McNare moved to Queens, he got
a job at the Transit Authority.

28:20.345 --> 28:24.714
Now, by 1988, he was working
at the West 4th Street station.

28:24.783 --> 28:28.879
So far, Mr. McNare seems nothing
more than a victim of coincidence.

28:28.954 --> 28:31.889
We've tracked his history. Not
only was he around for the killings,

28:31.957 --> 28:35.415
we can even explain
why he stopped in 1992.

28:35.494 --> 28:39.692
He got married that year. Now,
if his wife was a true masochist,

28:39.765 --> 28:43.223
someone who would let him act
out his sadistic fantasies,

28:43.301 --> 28:45.201
he wouldn't need
unwilling partners.

28:45.270 --> 28:47.932
But when his wife died
last year of breast cancer,

28:48.006 --> 28:50.031
he would have started
hunting for new partners.

28:50.108 --> 28:53.009
And the '96 murder,
if he was married...

28:53.078 --> 28:56.946
His wife had her first bout
of cancer back then.

28:57.015 --> 29:00.041
She was sick for a year, she
wouldn't have been up for his games.

29:00.118 --> 29:03.610
But if, as you say, Mr.
McNare's a sexual sadist,

29:03.688 --> 29:07.055
that's something he and his
son would have in common.

29:07.626 --> 29:11.585
And sexual sadism is not
an inherited trait, is it?

29:12.531 --> 29:13.555
No.

29:14.332 --> 29:18.496
I don't know why Keith has the same
sexual hard-wiring as his father.

29:18.570 --> 29:22.973
You have no evidence what Mr.
McNare's sexual proclivities are.

29:23.041 --> 29:24.941
His ex-wife would know.

29:28.346 --> 29:30.405
Keith hasn't seen Frank
since he was eight.

29:30.482 --> 29:32.848
Why are you
interested in him?

29:36.688 --> 29:39.782
Frank's sexual interests
when you were married,

29:40.292 --> 29:44.353
did they include bondage
or pain, even in mild forms?

29:44.429 --> 29:46.795
No, our sex life
was very conventional.

29:46.865 --> 29:50.596
Mrs. Durbin, you know
what Keith has admitted to.

29:51.303 --> 29:54.966
Now, his behavior
has a source.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.803
Maybe it was something
in his childhood.

30:01.746 --> 30:03.646
You remember something.

30:03.882 --> 30:06.817
It was such
a childish thing.

30:08.487 --> 30:12.651
And I yelled at him for it,
I shouldn't have. He was seven.

30:14.192 --> 30:15.284
I came into my room

30:15.360 --> 30:19.194
and found that he'd dressed his
teddy bear in my underthings.

30:19.865 --> 30:22.197
It was on the floor
on its stomach.

30:22.267 --> 30:26.033
I know it's normal for
children to be curious, but...

30:27.973 --> 30:29.133
There's something else?

30:29.207 --> 30:33.200
He had tied a string, a blue
string, around the teddy bear's leg.

30:37.249 --> 30:39.979
You remember where
he'd been that day?

30:40.051 --> 30:42.383
With Frank. Frank was
a claims adjuster.

30:42.454 --> 30:46.788
Saturday afternoons he'd take
photos of damaged cars and homes.

30:46.858 --> 30:49.019
Sometimes he'd take
Keith with him.

30:49.094 --> 30:51.085
What kind of camera did he use?

30:51.163 --> 30:52.528
A Polaroid.

30:53.331 --> 30:57.995
And while Frank was with clients,
Keith would wait in the car.

30:58.703 --> 30:59.795
Yes.

31:01.139 --> 31:03.699
Keith might've found
something in his father's car.

31:03.775 --> 31:05.402
Say, a photo.

31:05.477 --> 31:07.468
Something that made
a deep impression,

31:07.546 --> 31:10.913
so deep that he recreated
it with his teddy bear.

31:10.982 --> 31:12.108
Photo of what?

31:12.184 --> 31:16.086
We know Jake likes to take pictures
of his victims bound and gagged.

31:16.154 --> 31:20.887
But in 1977, 12 years before
the first Body By Jake murder?

31:21.526 --> 31:24.120
The first one that
Jake took credit for.

31:24.196 --> 31:25.185
Here.

31:25.263 --> 31:27.163
"Kimberly Lange,
19, disappeared

31:27.232 --> 31:30.133
"from a parking lot
in New Rochelle in 1977."

31:30.202 --> 31:32.727
Her remains were
identified in 1983.

31:33.638 --> 31:35.765
She's slender,
with long dark hair.

31:35.840 --> 31:36.829
Jake's type.

31:37.108 --> 31:39.235
ME found ligature
marks on her left ankle

31:39.311 --> 31:43.179
and two strands of blue and white
polyester embedded in her wrist.

31:43.248 --> 31:45.910
Assuming that 7-year-old Keith
did see a photo of the victim,

31:45.984 --> 31:50.080
from that one instance, he developed
a full-blown sexual obsession?

31:50.155 --> 31:53.318
Well, the image of a
terrified, half-naked woman,

31:57.028 --> 31:58.086
it's shocking.

31:58.163 --> 32:02.395
The boy, he would have known
that it was secret and forbidden.

32:02.467 --> 32:05.368
It would've imprinted
itself on his psyche.

32:06.037 --> 32:07.129
Somehow he figured out

32:07.205 --> 32:10.732
that the photo that he saw was
of a woman about to be murdered.

32:10.809 --> 32:13.903
Well, it was front-page
news when they ID'ed her.

32:14.913 --> 32:18.974
And they describe her as having a
birthmark over her right shoulder blade.

32:19.050 --> 32:20.039
The photo that Keith
would've seen,

32:20.118 --> 32:23.519
it would've been of her lying
on her stomach, bound and gagged,

32:23.588 --> 32:25.453
birthmark would have been
visible, he would have seen it.

32:25.523 --> 32:29.357
He was 13 when she was found, he
would've remembered the birthmark,

32:29.427 --> 32:31.987
he would've figured out
his father killed her.

32:32.063 --> 32:33.655
If he knows, why not say something?

32:33.732 --> 32:35.495
Well, we'll ask him.

32:35.934 --> 32:39.233
And let his lawyer know we're
looking at other suspects?

32:39.304 --> 32:42.637
Have you even collected DNA
samples from Frank McNare yet?

32:42.707 --> 32:44.197
Get us the paper,
we'll get on it.

32:44.276 --> 32:46.608
It's better to cast
a wider net.

32:46.945 --> 32:50.244
We might not want Frank
knowing that he's a suspect.

32:51.049 --> 32:52.983
They said they're gonna
take about 10 minutes.

32:53.051 --> 32:54.040
Yeah.

32:54.119 --> 32:58.886
Mr. McNare, you here
to volunteer your DNA?

32:58.957 --> 33:00.584
This still about that girl?

33:00.659 --> 33:02.684
We took samples from
every guy at her work,

33:02.761 --> 33:05.924
now we're doing the same
along the route she traveled.

33:05.997 --> 33:08.363
No one's turned us
down yet. How about it?

33:10.869 --> 33:13.736
The big DNA dragnet, huh?

33:15.607 --> 33:18.132
This what you guys do
when you run out of ideas?

33:18.209 --> 33:19.642
Pretty much.

33:19.978 --> 33:23.607
Now, there's a questionnaire
to fill out for every sample.

33:25.717 --> 33:27.742
You have any kids? Why
do you need to know that?

33:27.819 --> 33:29.719
We don't,
the lab does.

33:31.389 --> 33:33.914
Sure. I got one son.

33:34.192 --> 33:35.352
Date of birth?

33:35.427 --> 33:39.921
1971. No, wait, '70.

33:40.532 --> 33:41.794
City of residence?

33:41.866 --> 33:45.063
I'm not sure. He was my
kid from my first wife.

33:45.136 --> 33:47.696
Well, how about the last time
you talked to him, where was he?

33:47.772 --> 33:52.072
He was 13,
he called me.

33:52.544 --> 33:54.239
He was still
in New Rochelle.

33:54.312 --> 33:56.303
Kid's mother was
getting remarried.

33:56.381 --> 33:58.645
Her husband
wanted to adopt him.

33:58.717 --> 34:02.448
He had this crazy idea that
I wouldn't be his dad anymore.

34:02.520 --> 34:03.680
I hope you
set him straight.

34:03.755 --> 34:07.054
I told him that a piece of
paper doesn't mean squat.

34:08.426 --> 34:13.295
He was my flesh and blood, my
DNA, can't run away from it.

34:14.666 --> 34:19.069
He got the best of me the
night I rolled off his mother.

34:24.175 --> 34:25.505
Open wide.

34:27.045 --> 34:29.536
I saw right through
that DNA crap.

34:29.614 --> 34:32.844
If I hadn't volunteered, they'd use it
as an excuse to crawl right up my ass!

34:32.917 --> 34:36.181
Frank, relax. They've
already indicted somebody.

34:36.254 --> 34:38.380
Some guy named
Keith Durbin.

34:45.897 --> 34:48.228
McNare's DNA was
a five-point match

34:48.299 --> 34:50.130
to the sample
from the crime scene.

34:50.201 --> 34:52.567
Same as his son.
What progress.

34:53.271 --> 34:57.833
We now have two suspects, each of whom
create reasonable doubt for the other.

34:57.909 --> 35:01.743
If Durbin told us what he saw
in that photo when he was 7,

35:02.046 --> 35:03.604
maybe we'd get somewhere with McNare.

35:03.681 --> 35:05.239
What are the
chances of that?

35:05.316 --> 35:08.752
When he was 13, he realized
that he was sexually aroused

35:08.820 --> 35:13.519
by the image of a woman being
tortured and murdered by his father.

35:13.591 --> 35:15.889
Now, that's knowledge that
I can't imagine living with.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.587
He's not responsible
for her death.

35:17.662 --> 35:19.994
He believes that he
inherited his father's evil.

35:20.064 --> 35:22.624
And he believes that because
his father told him as much.

35:22.700 --> 35:27.831
He just thinks it's a matter of time until
he becomes the killer that his father is.

35:27.906 --> 35:30.101
It's irrational,
but it's the one thing

35:30.175 --> 35:32.643
that he most deeply
believes about himself.

35:32.710 --> 35:34.302
He probably thinks
if he tells anybody

35:34.379 --> 35:36.472
his father killed
that girl in 1977,

35:36.548 --> 35:38.812
we'll lock him up
along with his dad.

35:38.883 --> 35:42.250
Well, how do we liberate
Mr. Durbin from that belief?

35:43.621 --> 35:46.556
Well, his father may
be the only one who can.

35:47.559 --> 35:49.288
He said all he's gonna
say about the charges.

35:49.360 --> 35:54.423
Well, actually, we were hoping
for information on another case.

35:55.333 --> 35:57.494
If he gives us
some help on this case,

35:57.569 --> 36:01.562
then the DA will give him some
consideration on the other ones.

36:01.639 --> 36:03.436
He's not a suspect
in this new case?

36:03.508 --> 36:07.638
He would have been 7 years old at
the time, that's what I'm saying.

36:11.382 --> 36:12.906
Kimberly Lange.

36:14.085 --> 36:17.384
She's from your old stomping
ground in New Rochelle.

36:17.755 --> 36:22.158
She disappeared in 1977, her
remains were found in 1983.

36:23.261 --> 36:26.287
Is there anything you
can tell me about this?

36:28.833 --> 36:32.360
His flesh, his blood.
You're just like him.

36:34.539 --> 36:37.440
That is what you
believe, isn't it, Keith?

36:38.109 --> 36:39.872
Who's he talking about?

36:39.944 --> 36:41.172
Nothing. Nobody.

36:41.246 --> 36:44.340
If your family ever found out, your
mother, your sister, your stepfather,

36:44.415 --> 36:45.609
they'd write you off,
wouldn't they?

36:45.683 --> 36:46.672
I don't know anything.

36:46.751 --> 36:47.911
'Cause it's just
a matter of time

36:47.986 --> 36:51.786
until you become him,
until you do what he does.

36:56.027 --> 36:58.359
Is that what
you believe, Keith?

37:01.799 --> 37:03.824
You need
to see something.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.169
There he is, Keith.

37:13.177 --> 37:18.513
The man whose perversions have haunted
you, overwhelmed you all these years.

37:19.517 --> 37:20.506
My dad?

37:20.585 --> 37:21.882
Came here
to talk about you.

37:21.953 --> 37:24.387
You wanna hear
what he has to say?

37:27.225 --> 37:28.283
<i>What was that?</i>

37:28.359 --> 37:30.589
<i>They're doing renovations next door.</i>

37:31.896 --> 37:35.297
<i>Let's talk about
your son, Keith.</i>

37:36.834 --> 37:39.894
<i>After we got your DNA, we
tracked down his whereabouts...</i>

37:39.971 --> 37:42.132
<i>He's the guy you should
be looking at for this.</i>

37:42.507 --> 37:44.634
<i>Well, it's funny
you should say that.</i>

37:44.709 --> 37:46.904
<i>We talked to his mother.
She told us</i>

37:46.978 --> 37:51.540
<i>she remembered him dressing up his
teddy bear in her bra and panties</i>

37:51.616 --> 37:54.710
<i>and tying a little
string to the bear's foot.</i>

37:54.786 --> 37:57.380
<i>Well,
there you go.</i>

37:57.455 --> 37:59.855
<i>Pantywaist little pervert.</i>

38:00.959 --> 38:03.519
<i>His mother did it to him,
all that mollycoddling.</i>

38:03.595 --> 38:05.085
<i>How do you figure?</i>

38:05.163 --> 38:10.100
<i>She would let little Keith sleep
in the bed with us until he was 5.</i>

38:11.469 --> 38:14.404
<i>That's not normal,
not for a boy.</i>

38:15.206 --> 38:18.300
<i>What I don't
understand, Frank,</i>

38:18.376 --> 38:20.503
<i>didn't you tell him
when he was 13</i>

38:20.578 --> 38:22.842
<i>that everything
he was he owed to you?</i>

38:23.648 --> 38:25.309
<i>The flesh
and blood speech,</i>

38:25.383 --> 38:28.978
<i>how he couldn't run away from the
great genetic gift you gave him?</i>

38:29.053 --> 38:32.022
<i>I just wanted to get him off the phone.</i>

38:32.757 --> 38:34.657
<i>He was all upset
about being adopted.</i>

38:34.726 --> 38:37.957
<i>We heard you were in a
hurry to sign off on that.</i>

38:38.630 --> 38:42.088
<i>Was it because you'd be off
the hook for child support?</i>

38:43.968 --> 38:46.562
<i>These cops,
they're geniuses.</i>

38:49.474 --> 38:53.433
<i>You know, sometimes I'd look
into that mewly little kid's face</i>

38:54.512 --> 38:57.481
<i>and wonder if he even
was my flesh and blood.</i>

38:59.217 --> 39:02.277
<i>That mother of his?
I wouldn't put it past her.</i>

39:07.825 --> 39:10.919
You still think that
you're anything like him?

39:11.295 --> 39:14.059
This cruel
and uncaring man.

39:14.132 --> 39:17.727
He has no guilt and no shame.
You're nothing like him.

39:19.504 --> 39:21.301
Do you think that
you're the first son

39:21.372 --> 39:24.864
that's afraid of becoming
his imperfect father? No.

39:25.643 --> 39:28.976
His flaws, his sins, they're
his, they're not yours!

39:31.482 --> 39:33.416
That image?
That image,

39:35.053 --> 39:38.853
the image that's dominated
your thoughts, he created it!

39:39.824 --> 39:43.487
Keith, it's time, man,
it's time to spit it out.

39:47.432 --> 39:49.229
Tell us what you saw.

39:53.771 --> 39:56.001
Were you in your
father's car?

39:58.209 --> 39:59.972
You find something?

40:04.682 --> 40:06.479
Did you find a photo?

40:09.120 --> 40:10.109
Yeah.

40:10.188 --> 40:11.348
What was in the photo?

40:15.660 --> 40:17.287
There was a girl.

40:20.098 --> 40:25.559
She was tied up,
like the other girls.

40:27.605 --> 40:29.129
She was afraid.

40:31.843 --> 40:36.371
We're gonna need
exact details.

40:38.182 --> 40:45.111
She was wearing a white
bra and white panties.

40:48.893 --> 40:51.623
She had a mark
on her right shoulder.

40:52.997 --> 40:54.430
A birthmark.

40:55.500 --> 40:56.831
What else?

41:00.037 --> 41:02.005
She was tied
with rope.

41:02.073 --> 41:06.703
Around her hands.
And around her ankle.

41:08.546 --> 41:10.013
And her neck.

41:12.216 --> 41:14.081
A blue and white rope.

41:16.387 --> 41:19.322
I didn't know why she
was tied up like that.

41:20.625 --> 41:24.755
Why Dad had her picture
hidden in the glove box.

41:27.999 --> 41:30.559
I knew I wasn't
supposed to look at it,

41:30.635 --> 41:35.732
but I couldn't help it.
I couldn't...

41:40.978 --> 41:44.744
I do have a... Oh, well,
look who's joining the party.

41:45.049 --> 41:47.176
Have you got your
list of questions?

41:47.251 --> 41:48.684
Just answers, Jake.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.646
What was all that
racket out there?

41:50.721 --> 41:53.781
That was the sound of the
hammer coming down on you, Jake.

41:53.858 --> 41:54.950
Stop calling
me that.

41:55.026 --> 41:57.290
Your son.
He gave you up.

41:57.361 --> 41:58.885
Kimberly Lange.

42:00.298 --> 42:03.131
He found your Polaroid
of her in your car.

42:03.935 --> 42:06.199
He hasn't been in my car since he was 8.

42:06.270 --> 42:07.498
You're gonna believe
what a kid saw?

42:07.572 --> 42:10.166
He remembers everything.

42:10.975 --> 42:13.341
Everything that
excited his dad.

42:13.911 --> 42:17.642
Right down to the color of the rope
that you used on her, blue and white?

42:17.715 --> 42:21.412
Same color of the fibers found
embedded in Kimberly's wrist.

42:21.485 --> 42:23.419
I gotta figure
this out for you, huh?

42:23.487 --> 42:25.455
The kid probably read
about it in the papers.

42:25.523 --> 42:27.320
That detail was never made public.

42:27.391 --> 42:29.359
It was never
in the papers.

42:33.698 --> 42:35.461
That little bastard.

42:35.533 --> 42:37.660
He's free of you
now, Frank.

42:39.403 --> 42:44.636
Cast you out of his head.
Out of his head.

42:45.176 --> 42:46.803
Get up, big man,
you're under arrest

42:46.878 --> 42:49.438
for the murder
of Kimberly Lange.

42:51.249 --> 42:52.716
Six counts
of first-degree murder,

42:52.783 --> 42:56.344
and you'll be hearing from
the authorities in New Jersey.

42:58.756 --> 43:00.883
You nosy little deviant.

43:00.958 --> 43:03.222
Your own father,
how could you?

43:03.294 --> 43:04.488
How could you, Dad?

43:05.763 --> 43:09.494
Dad? You're no
son of mine.

43:12.303 --> 43:15.067
That's the nicest thing
he could have said to him.
