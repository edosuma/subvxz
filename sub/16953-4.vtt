WEBVTT

00:02.961 --> 00:04.296
I feel completely distraught.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.047
I didn't think we'd
go through with it.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.549
Now it's a lot of uncertainty.

00:07.591 --> 00:08.926
It's a shock.

00:08.968 --> 00:10.761
We're all in deep shit.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.930
Better the devil you
know, than you don't.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.139
It goes on.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.265
I feel it's like the
end of the world.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.518
It feels pretty bad.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.060
It's the ramifications
of it all.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.729
There doesn't seem
to be a plan for

00:20.771 --> 00:22.982
what we're going to do now.

00:23.022 --> 00:26.694
You don't know what to do,
because they're all arguing.

00:26.735 --> 00:31.762
It little woken them, but...
I think human beings

00:31.763 --> 00:36.036
are still stupid and
ego gets in the way.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.919
I believe some things to be
true about England, other than

01:24.960 --> 01:28.047
that I know I can always
find friends there.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.374
It's where you can
find some of the best

01:29.381 --> 01:30.591
restaurants in Europe.

01:30.592 --> 01:31.800
It's beautiful.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.762
It's... I don't know...
Sophisticated.

01:34.803 --> 01:35.888
They're old.

01:35.889 --> 01:36.972
They've been around.

01:37.014 --> 01:40.746
But on this last trip,
unexpectedly, the mood in London

01:40.747 --> 01:44.145
became darker, more
uncertain about the future.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.147
The British people
spoke last night.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.295
Brutal wake-up call.

01:47.296 --> 01:50.151
It turns out that it
was about immigration,

01:50.193 --> 01:52.529
that more than half of
Britain's immigration

01:52.571 --> 01:53.948
comes from outside the EU.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.156
It's a disaster, a calamity.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.639
The young are very, very
angry about what's happened

01:57.640 --> 02:01.204
and the gamble that's being
taken with their future.

02:02.497 --> 02:06.585
Few in London, anyway, went to
sleep thinking that England

02:06.586 --> 02:07.962
would leave the European Union.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.213
That was for the rubes, the
people from the sticks,

02:10.255 --> 02:12.758
the country people,
old, white people,

02:12.800 --> 02:17.429
people who felt pushed out,
neglected, disenfranchised

02:17.430 --> 02:19.557
by the new, the young, the
foreign, the decidedly

02:19.558 --> 02:21.642
less-white England of today.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.311
The votes were tallied,
and the majority

02:24.312 --> 02:25.604
had decided to Brexit.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.189
♪ And the RAF of England ♪

02:28.231 --> 02:31.151
The ramifications were unclear,
but the financial markets

02:31.152 --> 02:34.696
plummeted, the nation's
credit rating was downgraded,

02:34.738 --> 02:38.575
the prime minister resigned,
and both political parties'

02:38.576 --> 02:41.870
leadership basically
disintegrated overnight.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.795
♪

02:49.837 --> 02:52.798
In uncertain times, I always
look for the comforting

02:52.840 --> 02:55.884
and the familiar, the
things that always, for me,

02:55.926 --> 02:58.658
made England great,
like one of my favorite

02:58.659 --> 03:01.307
restaurants on Earth,
and one of the chefs

03:01.308 --> 03:02.516
I like and respect most.

03:02.557 --> 03:06.227
This restaurant helped
make a persuasive argument

03:06.269 --> 03:09.981
that there is some kind of
merit -to British cooking.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.733
Yes.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.234
It's absolutely true.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.113
Fergus Henderson, the
most influential chef

03:16.155 --> 03:18.886
of the last two decades,
even though you have likely

03:18.887 --> 03:20.241
never heard of him.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.243
He changed everything.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.622
It seems an instinctive
thing to cook old-school,

03:24.623 --> 03:27.248
simple, proud, English
country cooking.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.169
But it started a
quiet revolution.

03:31.586 --> 03:36.257
St. John, I love you and I
need you now more than ever.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.259
It's about the single
ingredient on the plate,

03:38.301 --> 03:41.262
speaking for itself in that
classic Italian sort of way.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.431
And so you can get lost.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.727
Roast bone marrow with
parsley and caper salad,

03:46.768 --> 03:48.311
sourdough bread made here.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.481
A dish that would become
absolutely iconic.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.109
If you've ever eaten
bone marrow anywhere,

03:54.151 --> 03:57.278
it's very likely because
they did it here first.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.075
My dinner companion is food
critic and author Jay Rayner,

04:01.116 --> 04:03.785
a man never with a
shortage of opinions.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.704
Bones.

04:05.705 --> 04:07.581
Thank you, yes.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.290
Salt.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.211
And there you go It's
a simple, good thing,

04:12.252 --> 04:14.171
but it's one of the most
influential dishes,

04:14.213 --> 04:15.714
like, in the last 20 years.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.882
It's a good thing.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.551
You see his imprint everywhere.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.281
It's true.

04:20.281 --> 04:22.763
And what's interesting
is that the aesthetic

04:21.011 --> 04:24.681
gets passed down in other
ways that you don't expect.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.183
Yeah.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.809
As I've become
older, I've noticed

04:27.851 --> 04:31.333
the food that I yearn for
is food that I react to

04:31.334 --> 04:33.314
in an entirely emotional way.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.610
The problem is that it's
so very, very rare.

04:36.651 --> 04:41.280
I'm looking for a suspension...
No-

04:41.281 --> 04:43.324
-...of logic and reason.

04:43.366 --> 04:47.746
This is something that I got
here from the beginning.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.395
Pickled calves tripe with
radish, shaved carrot,

04:50.396 --> 04:51.541
and watercress.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.105
Lovely.

04:52.106 --> 04:52.626
Wow.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.398
Wow.

04:53.399 --> 04:54.128
Thank you.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.538
There are some tripe
dishes that are just

04:55.545 --> 04:56.755
uniquely wonderful.

04:56.756 --> 04:57.965
And it's a tricky ingredient.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.341
Once you're cooking it,
it smells like wet dog.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.928
The way we smell things and
taste them is very different.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.096
All the best foods stink.

05:04.097 --> 05:05.222
Yeah.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.057
And it's an extraordinary thing.

05:07.099 --> 05:10.351
These foods, there's a faint
whiff of death about them,

05:10.393 --> 05:12.854
are the ones that remind you
that you're the most alive.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.023
The scent of your own mortality.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.357
Of your own mortality.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.029
Skate poached in court bouillon,
with fennel in green sauce

05:21.071 --> 05:23.364
of fresh parsley,
herbs, and anchovies.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.428
Hmm.

05:24.429 --> 05:25.450
It's nice.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.476
Savory treats -in
the form of kidney.

05:30.477 --> 05:31.748
Oh, the little kidneys.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.374
They're so pretty.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.669
And how were these
kidneys done, sir?

05:35.710 --> 05:38.839
Well, seasoned fair... Nice.

05:38.880 --> 05:43.260
And then put sauce...
P'shh, p'shh!

05:43.302 --> 05:44.970
Sizzling.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.849
Chicken stock...
Butter, p'shh, p'shh.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.977
P'shh, shh, and toast.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.687
Done.

05:53.728 --> 05:54.855
Yes, thank you.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.190
Good, wow.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.315
Eat well.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.399
Thank you.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.994
Pig's head and potato pie.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.913
The head brined, slowly
simmered until tender,

06:11.955 --> 06:15.146
stripped away from the bone,
and seasoned then baked

06:15.147 --> 06:16.835
in pastry with potatoes.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.795
Yes, please.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.131
A traditional dish
that exemplifies

06:21.173 --> 06:22.841
everything I believe in.

06:22.883 --> 06:23.654
Wow.

06:23.655 --> 06:24.425
Nice.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.447
Thank you, sir.

06:25.448 --> 06:26.427
Thank you.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.971
All right.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.266
Oh, look at that.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.371
Great joy.

06:32.372 --> 06:33.434
That's working.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.145
Is this a hot water pastry?

06:35.187 --> 06:38.169
So, it's a puff pastry, but
somehow transfers of fats

06:38.170 --> 06:40.963
through the pig's head out
and the [indistinct] in

06:40.964 --> 06:43.465
makes it so the crust...
It's gorgeous.

06:43.466 --> 06:44.445
Indeed.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.697
Oh, God, that's good.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.032
Extraordinary.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.868
You look at this pie, and it's
almost like something out

06:48.742 --> 06:49.868
of a children's book.

06:49.910 --> 06:50.702
Right.

06:50.703 --> 06:52.913
The pie tradition is
something very, very special.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.040
If you go back in history
to the Hogarth painting,

06:55.082 --> 06:57.271
"The Roast Beef of Old England"...
Yup.

06:57.272 --> 06:59.460
...you'll realize that
actually we were far ahead

06:59.461 --> 07:01.963
of the French in the
preparation of beef

06:59.502 --> 07:01.963
and the roasting of meats.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.258
A lot of it was over our
side of the channel.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.383
Yeah.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.345
Which is no reason for
leaving the European Union.

07:09.763 --> 07:13.141
So they call it Great Britain.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.935
What's great about Britain?

07:14.976 --> 07:20.148
I can refer to a certain literacy
and a wry sense of humor,

07:20.190 --> 07:24.152
and a political tradition of
democracy, which, ironically,

07:24.153 --> 07:27.530
the referendum that's caused
so many of us so much pain

07:27.572 --> 07:29.074
is a perfect example of.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.493
Also, a weirdly cosmopolitan,
welcoming environment

07:32.535 --> 07:36.748
in which the history of
immigration into the country

07:36.790 --> 07:39.126
has defined a far
more open culture.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.921
Until this point I was very,
very proud, but that...

07:42.922 --> 07:43.671
I wouldn't be here.

07:43.713 --> 07:44.791
You know, my great-great
grandparents

07:44.798 --> 07:47.217
arrived as shtetl Jews off
the boat into the East End

07:47.218 --> 07:49.510
of London, and here I
am still to this day,

07:49.552 --> 07:51.512
and that's a very,
very important thing.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.223
A very tolerant country.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.933
This is a very traumatic moment.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.768
Will it all work out in the end?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.894
I have no idea.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.055
- Wow.
- It's the honest truth.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.522
Nothing is certain.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.942
♪

08:05.568 --> 08:08.447
You know what I like?
A good pub.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.158
Like the Princess
Victoria in West London,

08:11.199 --> 08:13.160
and stuff like this.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.744
Did you like pork scratchings?

08:14.786 --> 08:16.788
I do.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.581
Hmm. Cheers.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.585
Oh, that's insanely good.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.543
Maybe you wouldn't think that
the legendary cookbook author

08:22.585 --> 08:25.610
Nigella Lawson and I could
be friends, but we are.

08:25.611 --> 08:28.133
We are, admittedly,
very different.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.386
She is the very definition of
kindness, elegance, grace,

08:31.428 --> 08:33.554
the woman who taught
England to cook.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.554
Nice.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.015
What do you get here ordinarily?

08:36.057 --> 08:36.725
Scotch egg.

08:36.726 --> 08:37.392
All right.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.769
Scotch eggs, please,
and some whitebait.

08:39.811 --> 08:40.645
Certainly.

08:40.647 --> 08:41.480
And some chips.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.475
Whitebait? This is, like, the
greatest thing ever. Really?

08:43.482 --> 08:45.233
Oh, yeah. Whitebait
is so good, isn't it?

08:45.275 --> 08:46.943
In a little pub, you
can get whitebait?

08:46.985 --> 08:50.468
Well, I'm sure in Charles
Dickens' time, they used to have

08:50.469 --> 08:51.281
whitebait then.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.574
Mind you, then, they used
to have oysters too, so...

08:53.616 --> 08:55.160
I can't hear you
over the crunching.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.696
I can't hear myself over
the crunch, actually.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.664
I'll be... I lost interest
in what I was saying.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.460
Whitebait, tiny baby herring
lightly battered whole

09:03.461 --> 09:05.004
and fried, tossed
with a little bit

09:05.005 --> 09:08.673
of lemon juice and salt,
the perfect bar food.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.091
There's this
slightly crisp, huh?

09:10.133 --> 09:10.842
Hmm.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.302
Do you have this in the States?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.179
You're starting to see
them, but almost never.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.638
Beautiful, though, aren't they?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.598
And fat chips, always important.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
What is the appropriate
condiment with chips?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.603
Being old-fashioned, I
think vinegar and salt.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.524
If I'm in Brussels or Holland,
I'm fine about mayonnaise,

09:25.565 --> 09:26.934
- but if it's here...
- Oh [indistinct] there,

09:26.941 --> 09:28.276
- I'm with you there.
- Yeah.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.404
And what is it, chips
with curry sauce?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.447
Hmm, fantastic. Sorry.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.909
It's really a matter of how
many Guinnesses you've had.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.619
A soft-boiled egg, wrap
it in minced pork,

09:38.661 --> 09:41.622
then roll it in bread crumbs, and what?
Deep-fry it?

09:41.664 --> 09:45.710
It's like a supernova of
unhealthiness and deliciousness.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.255
This is the important thing,
the softness of the yolk.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.630
Right. Who invented this?

09:49.672 --> 09:51.007
It's just fiendish.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.877
One of the explanations,
Scotch used to preserve eggs

09:52.884 --> 09:54.344
and send them to England.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.172
What would happen is that
they would [indistinct]

09:56.179 --> 09:59.349
Some sort of lime on them,
and it would discolor them,

09:59.391 --> 10:01.518
so they then covered
them to hide that.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.311
This is just right.

10:03.353 --> 10:07.065
When I grew up, they were
very low-rent, very cheap,

10:07.066 --> 10:09.943
rather spooky sausage
meat, rock-hard egg,

10:09.984 --> 10:12.863
that sort of tinge like,
you know, -Uranus.

10:12.864 --> 10:13.364
Right.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.741
Uranus, as they prefer to
call it now because they get

10:15.742 --> 10:16.533
embarrassed.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.119
And then deep-fried into those
cheap red bread crumbs.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.912
And then it got rehabilitated.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.123
Very good eggs, very
good pork meat.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.665
All your basic food groups.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.785
- Hmm.
- These are really good.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.918
Hmm, really good.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.379
Salt and fat, nothing better.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.089
Oh, yeah.

10:32.591 --> 10:33.592
This is nice.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.926
It is nice, strangely calm.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.596
It is an argument from England.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.158
Really?

10:38.159 --> 10:38.679
Yeah.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.681
- If you have a good pub...
- Yes.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.517
...and if you're
gonna have a pint,

10:42.559 --> 10:43.511
this is the perfect time.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.602
It's quiet.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.686
It is.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.689
We can pretend all is
right with the universe.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.774
I'm going to pretend.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.703
England, as the
anti-Brexit forces

11:02.745 --> 11:05.873
found out to their
dismay, ain't London.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.231
It's different out
there and a lot of it

11:09.232 --> 11:11.087
is very, very beautiful.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.756
As we get older, we
start to look backwards

11:13.798 --> 11:16.384
in our life and reflect.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.719
When we're young, we
only look forward,

11:18.761 --> 11:19.929
we don't think of our past.

11:19.971 --> 11:23.141
Our past has such a small value.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.811
I'm of an age now,
we become nostalgic,

11:26.853 --> 11:30.357
we become philosophical.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.589
One can, if a successful gentleman
of many accomplishments,

11:33.590 --> 11:36.737
for instance, with a little
bit of money to spend,

11:36.779 --> 11:39.595
make, as Emerson
advised, your own world

11:39.596 --> 11:40.908
far from the madness.

11:40.950 --> 11:45.746
We're in North Wiltshire, and
there's Bath in the distance.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.123
It's really beautiful.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.543
Oh, yeah, nice view.

11:49.584 --> 11:53.129
You'll see how it
just drifts away.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.756
So that's about five
miles as the crow flies.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.469
There are few chefs who set
the world of chefs aflame

11:59.511 --> 12:00.761
like Marco Pierre White.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.473
As young cooks, looking
at his incredible rise

12:03.515 --> 12:05.684
from working-class
boy to the youngest

12:05.685 --> 12:08.936
three-Michelin-starred chef in
the world, we were inspired,

12:08.978 --> 12:11.481
not just by his
accomplishments and his food,

12:11.523 --> 12:14.296
which were amazing, no
great chef had ever

12:14.297 --> 12:17.028
looked like him before
or talked like him.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.573
We were not, it appeared, alone.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.867
I want to turn Rudloe into a house...
Uhhmm.

12:22.868 --> 12:26.871
...not a hotel, so when you
walk inside, it's personal.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.789
Once obsessed with
nothing but working

12:28.831 --> 12:31.522
the hardest, the
longest, being the best,

12:31.523 --> 12:33.878
Marco has transferred
his obsessive nature

12:33.920 --> 12:37.173
to the more pleasurable task
of making the Rudloe Arms

12:37.174 --> 12:38.883
his perfect place.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.802
What's important
about a restaurant

12:41.844 --> 12:44.723
is the feel, not a look.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.726
You could go to the best
restaurant in the world tomorrow.

12:47.766 --> 12:48.928
They could serve the best food.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.812
But if you don't feel comfortable
within that environment,

12:51.854 --> 12:53.314
you'll never enjoy it.

12:53.356 --> 12:58.528
Inside is as much a project
as the grounds, every detail.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.656
Then you can be yourself.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.324
Number one, environment.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.825
Number two, service.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.369
Number three, food.

13:08.162 --> 13:12.125
A pan-roasted filet of
beef with escargot.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.336
Whoa. It's beautiful.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.837
Who do you want to come here?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.715
People who enjoy themselves.

13:18.757 --> 13:19.840
I like a mixed demographic.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.301
- I wanna have everybody.
- Uh-hmm.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.844
I don't want to just
target one market.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.930
Food should be affordable.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.101
Very, very good.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.730
Has your food always reflected
your aspirations and dreams

13:33.772 --> 13:35.148
rather than where you came from?

13:35.189 --> 13:38.234
I was born and bred on the
outskirts of Leeds in a project

13:38.235 --> 13:38.859
housing estate.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.780
Even though I was born into
very humble beginnings,

13:41.820 --> 13:44.865
I used to cross my road,
walk over the golf course,

13:44.907 --> 13:47.744
and there I was on the
Harewood Estates,

13:47.786 --> 13:51.018
designed by the great Capability
Brown, the stately home

13:51.019 --> 13:52.123
of the Earl of Harewood.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.083
That was my playground.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.505
I was fascinated by
the countryside.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.362
I loved the rivers, the
streams, the brooks,

14:01.363 --> 14:02.300
the fields, the woods.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.721
What was within them,
that's what captured me.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.765
It was a dream.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.892
That was my escapism.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.186
My mother died when I was six.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.731
Mother Nature, she became
my surrogate mother.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.899
And so, therefore, I
have this amazing

14:18.941 --> 14:22.320
love affair with nature.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.322
But look, once you go into
a high-end restaurant,

14:24.364 --> 14:27.429
you're about as far as
from nature as you can be.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.910
I mean, it's hard to
rise up the ranks

14:29.952 --> 14:32.914
of a good fine-dining restaurant,
particularly in the time

14:32.915 --> 14:34.499
that you came up.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.916
Shit was not easy.

14:35.958 --> 14:40.401
Everybody in the kitchen
that I started in came from

14:40.402 --> 14:41.840
a housing project.

14:41.881 --> 14:42.923
They were working-class.

14:42.965 --> 14:43.924
They were tough.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.010
They were hard, really hard.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.429
The flip side of that coin...

14:50.598 --> 14:52.058
was nature.

14:53.267 --> 14:57.480
It was all those beautiful
ingredients, that beautiful

14:57.481 --> 14:58.981
contradiction.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.238
Come see my family.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.034
Piggies! Come on,
piggy, piggy, piggies.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.411
Holy crap.

15:11.412 --> 15:12.746
Come on, piggies!

15:12.787 --> 15:13.954
Piggies! What do you think?

15:15.164 --> 15:16.283
They seemed very well-groomed.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.958
They're beautiful.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.370
Don't eat, that's... those
are jeans, not food.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.337
They give you love
bites, trust me.

15:21.379 --> 15:24.465
Piggies, what do you think about
our friends from America?

15:24.507 --> 15:26.342
- Yeah.
- What breed of pig are these?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.968
These are Oxford
Sandy and Black.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.846
They're a traditional
Wiltshire pig.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.891
In four months, this is
how big they've got.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.851
Wow.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.977
They remember your
voice and your smell.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.063
They're really,
really affectionate.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.981
Naturally, they're woodland.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.067
Indeed, beautiful.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.819
It's almost
self-sustaining here.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.863
Well, we will be for
a bacon [indistinct]

15:48.030 --> 15:49.407
Bye, pigs.

15:49.408 --> 15:50.784
Piggies.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.326
Piggies.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.371
I've never been happier here.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.082
I've found somewhere
I'm really happy.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.233
The legendary classic on
Marco's original menu

16:03.234 --> 16:07.049
back in the day, pig's trotter
a la Pierre Koffmann,

16:07.091 --> 16:10.010
an homage to another
great chef and mentor.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.012
It is perfection.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.599
Oh, my God, that is beautiful.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.539
When I was a young cook, we
would look at photographs

16:17.540 --> 16:20.855
of this dish, my
comrades and colleagues,

16:20.897 --> 16:23.441
and gape at it with wonder.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.026
First we'd say, "Oh, my
God, that's gorgeous,"

16:26.068 --> 16:27.111
and, "How did he do it?"

16:27.153 --> 16:29.029
It just got all of
the textural things

16:29.071 --> 16:31.031
that every great cuisine
around the world

16:31.073 --> 16:33.952
understands to be, "Wow."

16:33.993 --> 16:36.851
Pig's trotter has got 24
bones, so you have to remove

16:36.852 --> 16:37.747
all those bones.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.707
And then you braise
it for four hours.

16:39.749 --> 16:40.896
Right.

16:40.897 --> 16:42.042
It's very simple.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.420
People think it's more
complicated than it is.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.923
I know. This is
tricky... tricky dish.

16:46.965 --> 16:50.760
The hero of the dish,
really, is the skin.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.052
Yes.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.055
It's just one of those
great creations.

16:55.097 --> 16:59.936
As the French say, "We never
grow old around the table."

16:59.978 --> 17:04.106
They also say, "Only the
first bottle is expensive."

17:05.775 --> 17:06.859
Cheers.

love with this little part

17:20.915 --> 17:22.040
of England.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.172
I put myself out to

I'm gonna say I'm retired.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.091
And I like to do what I do here.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.093
If I look at the amount of
nature we have here now,

17:33.135 --> 17:35.013
since we've done what
we've done, it's enormous

17:35.054 --> 17:36.472
- -compared to what we had.
- Right.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.099
And I like seeing the
increase of songbirds,

17:39.141 --> 17:42.729

chicks, the geese they're my...

17:46.024 --> 17:47.108
Fabulous, aren't they?

17:47.109 --> 17:48.192
Amazing.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.361
They're nuts.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.530
They are beautifully,
beautifully nuts.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.784
There's no guarantees how
long we're gonna be here.

The mood in London is like a

18:10.048 --> 18:12.050
Drinking seems appropriate.

18:12.091 --> 18:17.931
But first, a proper base must
be established, some food.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.139
All right.

Yeah.

Saltfish, I think I'll

Uh-hmm.

So, yesterday, prime
minister resigned.

England leaving the
European Union.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.904

I don't believe

19:57.905 --> 20:00.324
in democracy anymore.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.661
How quickly the pound is

Sunderland to decide that.

struggling and the people

20:42.116 --> 20:43.534
that are doing well.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.099
What it really shone a
light on is how divided

20:46.100 --> 20:47.287
the country is.

People don't just look at
it as a financial thing.

cultural identity too.

accelerate in a mad panic.

Do you think if you extend
the drinking hours,

21:16.358 --> 21:18.903
that it would improve
behavior or make it worse?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.320
I mean, let's face it.

Because you kind of were

counter-cultural figure.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.255
Yeah, but I didn't start off

23:42.296 --> 23:44.840
I wanted to be an

I didn't like factory life,
but I had to go every week

23:47.844 --> 23:50.867

24:21.543 --> 24:22.920
Is it?

too, can learn to draw"

24:26.028 --> 24:27.507
and earn pounds."

the billet playing cards,

24:33.471 --> 24:35.599
blankets on the bed,
boots in the bed.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.017
Very simplistic stuff.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.145
Nevertheless, it got me started.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.771

of an echidna?

24:40.813 --> 24:42.022
I have not.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.108

type of creature.

endangered species."

But this.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.692
That is very difficult.

25:05.693 --> 25:07.756
I don't think I can do that.

25:07.798 --> 25:09.216
I'm quite sure I can't.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.135
My basic motor skills
are not so good.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.552

25:12.594 --> 25:14.138
Oh, blimey.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.639
More old-school on
the main courses.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.642
Fish and chips with
mushy peas over there,

25:18.684 --> 25:21.979
Steak and Stilton pie for me,
because any mystery meat

25:21.980 --> 25:25.565
wrapped in pastry at a pub
is pure crack for me.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.775
Thank you very much.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.068
Oh, you've got the pie, wow.

25:28.110 --> 25:28.840
Oh, yeah.

25:28.841 --> 25:29.569
Hmm.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.613
We don't do this
back in America.

25:32.823 --> 25:36.035
So many people have said to me,
"Do you pencil it in first?"

25:36.076 --> 25:39.288
I said, "No, you
just start drawing."

25:39.330 --> 25:40.998
"But don't you make a mistake?"

25:41.040 --> 25:43.250
I said, "There's no such
thing as a mistake."

25:43.292 --> 25:46.170
A mistake is an opportunity
to do something else.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.881
You have to leave it and let
nature take its course.

25:48.922 --> 25:51.967
Oh, my God, now,
isn't that lovely?

25:52.009 --> 25:54.594

25:54.636 --> 25:55.888
It's so good.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.598
All of nature is
impressing me, actually.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.601
That it's just so
wonderful how it works.

26:01.643 --> 26:06.773
It's a kind of natural process
of evolution, isn't it?

26:06.815 --> 26:10.486
It's what we're
doing all the time.

26:10.528 --> 26:12.279
You're certainly your
depiction of politicians

26:12.321 --> 26:14.865
early on. You seemed filled
with rage and disgust,

26:14.907 --> 26:16.283
deservedly, I'd think.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.203
And there were some epic
depictions of Nixon.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.247
Was it Nixon as Godzilla,
was it, that I...

26:21.288 --> 26:22.915
Yeah, he was a great subject.

26:22.956 --> 26:26.293
I mean, I've done him as a
flying Nixon, a vampire Nixon,

26:26.294 --> 26:28.628
bat Nixon... Did you ever
get an official reaction

26:28.670 --> 26:29.831
to your work from
the White House?

26:29.838 --> 26:30.860
Never.

26:30.861 --> 26:33.342
"I am not a giant,
shitting Godzilla."

26:34.301 --> 26:36.345
You don't wanna deny that.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.931
No, it's funny how that was.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.266
And Boris Johnson here.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.142
I think the hair, in
this case, is just...

26:42.184 --> 26:43.643
It's an irresistible impulse.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.645
Well, to do it, I... I've
got to come out

26:45.687 --> 26:47.147
with it more [indistinct]

26:47.148 --> 26:48.606
But it's perfect.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.445
Boris is our Trump.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.654
Well, they're both...
It is a supernova

26:54.696 --> 26:55.676
of incredibly bad hair.

26:55.677 --> 26:56.656
Yeah.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.889
I mean, the two of them together...
What's happening? What's

26:59.890 --> 27:01.078
going on in this country?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.704
Is it gonna be okay?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.331
Not at the moment, no.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.666
Does it say anything about
the country as a whole?

27:06.708 --> 27:07.876
So, I think it does.

27:07.918 --> 27:10.379
Perhaps there's been a
secret desire to really say,

27:10.380 --> 27:13.507
"Wait a minute, what would
it be like to be on a...

27:13.549 --> 27:15.759
The... a great British
Isles again?"

27:15.801 --> 27:17.761
I was doing this last week just

27:17.762 --> 27:20.722
because I can't stand
snakes, so I said,

27:20.723 --> 27:21.681
"Okay, I'll do you one."

27:21.723 --> 27:26.145
I did one snake last week,
decided to do this,

27:26.186 --> 27:28.606
Saint Lucia racer snake.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.690
Ugh, right there.

27:30.732 --> 27:34.111
And then the next day,
we had the referendum.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.697
Friday morning, when people
realized what had happened,

27:37.739 --> 27:38.949
there was a terrible gloom.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.993
There's a scent I...
We all felt it.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.870
This desire to restore
England to its former glory

27:43.912 --> 27:47.500
as the British Isles, it's
certainly given a revived,

27:47.541 --> 27:51.108
a very powerful urge in Scotland...
to reconsider whether

27:51.109 --> 27:52.630
they wanna be a part.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.798
Oh, dear. I think it's
only gonna get worse

27:54.840 --> 27:56.509
- -before it gets better.
- Uh-hmm.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.969
And I'm certain that what we
are experiencing at the moment

27:59.011 --> 28:02.431
is a kind of rather large
hangover from something

28:02.473 --> 28:07.561
that we've still got to come
to terms with and get over.

28:07.603 --> 28:10.230
Do you think some of your
stuff has anger in there,

28:10.272 --> 28:14.443
or exasperation, or...
That's... I think so... look,

28:14.485 --> 28:18.780
I said to... I don't know,
50 years ago that I wanted

28:18.781 --> 28:23.118
to change the world, and
I think, 50 years later,

28:23.160 --> 28:24.036
I succeeded.

28:24.037 --> 28:27.914
It's worse now than it was when
I started, so I changed it,

28:27.915 --> 28:30.167
being that was... This is great.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.481
It's kind of emerging.

28:31.482 --> 28:32.752
You know, it's coming.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.047
I mean, this guy, he
demands a Steadman.

28:35.088 --> 28:40.093
He really... -Something... -He
was born to have you work...

28:41.845 --> 28:44.097
I try to lighten it up a bit.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.402
The sea.

28:56.443 --> 28:59.071
The sea, where a man
can forget his trouble

28:59.112 --> 29:01.866
and the troubles of the
world, commune with something

29:01.867 --> 29:05.744
infinitely larger and more
powerful than himself.

29:07.663 --> 29:11.791
Where he could find himself
locked in an epic struggle

29:11.792 --> 29:16.004
with a creature of the sea,
plumbing the depths for that

29:11.833 --> 29:16.004
most primordial of needs:

29:16.046 --> 29:18.006
food.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.217
Well, let's hope we
have them quick.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.751
Get off, get off.

29:57.755 --> 29:59.298
Oh, my God, there's
the forehook, look.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.091
Oh, my God.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.842
Not good.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.513
Oh, my God, it got the bait.

30:07.681 --> 30:10.768
Nature, it's overrated.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.136
We're in the middle of
the English Channel.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.275
We are designed to find,
kill, tear apart,

30:18.317 --> 30:20.860
and devour the food
we need to survive.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.967
It is why God, in His
wisdom, gave us legs upon

30:22.968 --> 30:25.469
which to run, eyes in
the front of our heads

30:25.470 --> 30:27.951
to seek out prey,
fingernails and thumbs

30:27.993 --> 30:29.869
with which to tear
apart our victims,

30:29.911 --> 30:34.207
teeth to smash flesh and bone
between our mighty jaws.

30:42.591 --> 30:46.512
♪

30:50.932 --> 30:52.476
Here in the coastal
town of Weymouth

30:52.518 --> 30:54.561
at the Marlboro is
where I'll be smashing

30:54.603 --> 30:57.063
deep-fried haddock
between my freaking jaws

30:57.105 --> 30:58.940
with something called a chip.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.901
Sliced white bread and butter
so we can make a chip butty.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.069
Would you like a chip butty?

31:03.111 --> 31:05.280
I don't know that
I've ever had one.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.906
- I've heard of them.
- Delicious.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.575
All right, you're an
easy man to please.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.161
The chef suggests the mushy peas

31:11.203 --> 31:13.913
infused with butter and cream.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.367
I have such fond
memories of Weymouth.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.501
My sons went to school
just down the road.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.295
I used to bring them to the
Marlboro for lunch and that.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.963
And they weren't big
fans of fish and chips

31:22.005 --> 31:25.342
because they were, sort of, 13,
14 and they preferred meat

31:25.343 --> 31:26.552
to fish and chips.

31:26.593 --> 31:29.513
But this is the best restaurant,
in my opinion, in Weymouth.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.597
Thank you.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.932
Thank you, thank you,
that's very kind.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.518
I'll put the mushy
peas in the middle.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.353
You see, this is how
we do it in Yorkshire.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.772
So go ahead and taste the
mushy peas without vinegar.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.106
Bon appétit.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.107
They're all right.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.652
Now, put the vinegar on.

31:43.694 --> 31:48.782
Oh, my... So working-class,
as they say in Yorkshire.

31:48.824 --> 31:49.867
Mmm.

31:49.908 --> 31:50.985
Would you prefer
them with vinegar?

31:50.992 --> 31:51.986
It transforms the whole thing.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.246
Completely different, isn't it?

31:54.287 --> 31:56.874
I love buttering my bread.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.375
Now, this is the best bit.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.794
I can't believe you've
never had a chip butty.

32:00.836 --> 32:01.961
Well, today's the day.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.963
When I was a kid, this
was one of my favorites.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.966
The only fish I ever ate as
a child was fried haddock.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.968
Wouldn't eat any other fish.

32:09.010 --> 32:12.972
And then the vinegar,
quite generous.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.391
And then the salt.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.976
And this is what we call a
chip butty in Yorkshire

32:17.018 --> 32:18.395
where I come from.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.568
Mmm.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.154
I like the cheap bread
because the bread turns

32:27.155 --> 32:29.155
into the same texture
as the potato.

32:29.156 --> 32:29.989
Right.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.283
That's why it's perfect.

32:31.324 --> 32:35.141
If you have posh bread
or crusty bread, -Right.

32:35.142 --> 32:35.995
...it's not the same.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.018
How's your haddock?

32:38.019 --> 32:39.999
Good.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.419
But it's proper working-class
food, is fish and chips.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.004
Yeah, when I was a kid,
we'd eat them twice a week.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.945
They'd cook fish and chips in
dripping, -beef fat, not oil.

32:47.946 --> 32:48.842
Uh-hmm.

32:48.884 --> 32:51.678
It makes a massive, massive
difference in the flavor.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.013
Yeah.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.891
It's quite good.

32:55.933 --> 32:56.892
You were hungry.

32:56.934 --> 32:58.852
We worked hard out there.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.646
Keeping warm.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.481
Indeed.

33:02.522 --> 33:03.690
It's big.

33:03.732 --> 33:04.900
It's too big, look, I'm done.

33:04.942 --> 33:06.652
One more bite, yeah, me too.

33:06.693 --> 33:07.611
That's my problem.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.697
I go for the chip butty
before the fish.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.743
It's the child within me.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.922
Hidden away safely behind
the walls of a former

33:26.923 --> 33:29.716
Victorian-era schoolhouse,
insulated from the moronic

33:29.717 --> 33:33.052
inferno blazing outside,
is Rochelle Canteen,

33:33.094 --> 33:35.764
a green idyll, the
unpretentious brainchild

33:35.765 --> 33:38.078
of Margot Henderson and
her business partner

33:38.079 --> 33:39.058
Melanie Arnold.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.894
How long have you been
up and running here?

33:40.936 --> 33:41.708
Ten years.

33:41.709 --> 33:45.106
- God, I can't believe...
- Ten years, where have you been?

33:42.521 --> 33:45.106
I know, what is wrong with me?

33:45.148 --> 33:47.066
You were a chef
before Fergus, yes?

33:47.108 --> 33:48.902
Yeah. Well, I started
cooking in restaurants

33:48.944 --> 33:50.069
- -when I was 12.
- Yeah.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.113
But this is Fergus,
peas in their pods.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.073
We met when I was
working at the Eagle,

33:54.115 --> 33:57.160
and I said straightaway
to him, "We should open"

33:55.408 --> 33:57.160
a restaurant together."

33:57.202 --> 33:59.078
And he said, "Well,
that's a good idea",

33:59.120 --> 34:00.455
but let's be lovers as well,"

34:00.497 --> 34:02.290
which I always thought
was quite good.

34:02.332 --> 34:05.084
And then we had a restaurant.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.087
The whole area has
changed down to it.

34:08.129 --> 34:11.445
It's very Shoreditch,
groovy guys on little

34:11.446 --> 34:13.092
motorbikes with handlebars.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.379
What was the neighborhood
like before?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.513
Quite a large Bengali community.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.181
Before that, it was quite a
strong Jewish community.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.893
But then they moved out,
next group move in.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.268
It's a poor area.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.606
A lot of people working in the
fabric, clothing industries.

34:26.648 --> 34:29.525
The bandstand in the middle is
all the rubble from the war.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.152
I think the gardeners
still find, you know,

34:32.152 --> 34:34.155
children's shoes and things.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.739
Really?

34:35.741 --> 34:37.283
It is a very interesting area.

34:37.324 --> 34:40.495
Just how beautiful
these blocks are.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.288
It's quite a lot
of building works

34:42.330 --> 34:44.523
- -going on at the moment as well.
- Everywhere in London.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.543
I mean, the whole city seems
to be, kind of, transforming.

34:47.545 --> 34:51.047
It's certainly expensive...
My daughter, she's moving

34:51.089 --> 34:53.216
because of what happened
today about the EU.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.135
She's going to either live
in Scotland or New Zealand.

34:56.177 --> 35:01.140
And she's so embarrassed
and ashamed to be English.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.142
Is it the end of the world?

35:01.182 --> 35:04.978
It feels... right now, it feels
like the end of the world.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.230
We have separated.

35:06.231 --> 35:08.335
We're a little mean
island saying,

35:08.336 --> 35:10.651
"When the going gets
tough, we want to get out

35:10.652 --> 35:12.069
and just look after ourselves."

35:12.110 --> 35:15.154
It's so selfish and disgusting.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.638
It's also, out of London,
there is a lot of people

35:18.639 --> 35:20.702
who are really struggling
and have lost their way

35:20.703 --> 35:23.162
and don't believe in what
the government has done.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.164
So, I don't blame
the people either.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.167
But they're being fed, sort
of, lies, I would say.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.169
Anyway, it's all too depressing.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.672
We must change the subject.

35:32.714 --> 35:35.884
Vitello tonnato, cold-roasted
veal thinly sliced

35:35.926 --> 35:39.387
and covered with a creamy
sauce of tuna and capers.

35:39.429 --> 35:40.805
Oh, this looks good.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.181
These are good.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.224
Hmm.

35:43.225 --> 35:44.225
So, what's going right?

35:44.267 --> 35:45.978
I mean, it's a bad day to ask.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.931
Well, there's lots of great
restaurants opening in the city.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.606
Right, London, and
UK in general.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.858
It's just gotten just better
and better every year, right.

35:51.900 --> 35:52.985
It's brilliant, isn't it?

35:53.026 --> 35:54.193
It's so exciting.

35:53.026 --> 35:55.487
Great chefs... The
people who voted "for,"

35:55.528 --> 35:57.614
was it a sense of people
who feel they just...

35:57.656 --> 35:58.782
They've been screwed?

35:58.824 --> 36:00.659
I mean, young people,
unemployment in the north,

36:00.700 --> 36:01.764
it's dire.

36:01.765 --> 36:02.828
Right.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.913
People haven't got jobs.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.206
But, I mean, everyone's
looking for chefs.

36:07.248 --> 36:07.811
Right.

36:07.812 --> 36:10.877
Why we should turn... We should
set up some great big new

36:10.919 --> 36:12.211
cookery schools in Britain.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.213
I mean, no one can get
enough decent chef.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.049
- Uh-hmm.
- Some more encouragement.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.926
I mean, there is work to be had.

36:17.968 --> 36:22.221
But it's just how you find
it and where you come from.

36:22.263 --> 36:25.851
Lamb chops with lentils
and green sauce.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.062
Hmm, so good.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.264
Where'd this little
lamb come from?

36:30.271 --> 36:32.273
From Wales, Welsh lamb.

36:32.315 --> 36:35.444
Nice. People who dine out now,
do they want food simpler

36:35.445 --> 36:37.696
and more stripped down,
and with less bullshit,

36:37.737 --> 36:40.448
or do you think it's
going the other way?

36:40.490 --> 36:42.492
Simple, but with
a sort of twist.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.078
That have got a story about
where it's come from.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.454
- Right.
- It's very interesting.

36:46.496 --> 36:49.541
You know, they're all
coming up with new dishes.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.919
Should I be buying pounds now with...
No, that's what

36:52.920 --> 36:53.545
I kept thinking.

36:53.586 --> 36:54.671
What do we all do now?

36:54.713 --> 36:56.506
If I were a cruelly
cynical, exploitative...

36:56.548 --> 36:58.257
That little [indistinct]

36:58.258 --> 37:00.844
You know... what would I...
What would I be doing?

37:00.886 --> 37:02.261
Are you selling
or you're buying?

37:02.303 --> 37:03.297
Yeah, I don't... I'm [indistinct]

37:03.304 --> 37:06.058
Look at me, master
of high finance.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.184
You look so well.

37:07.225 --> 37:07.934
Well, thank you.

37:07.935 --> 37:10.269
You must be...
You're making me feel

37:08.685 --> 37:10.269
much better without them.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.355
This meal and the
wine, I have to say,

37:12.397 --> 37:15.254
your company has made me feel
much better about the world

37:15.255 --> 37:16.234
and myself.

37:26.369 --> 37:31.290
Can you reinvent yourself
in England or in London...

37:31.332 --> 37:32.500
I mean, maybe you can.

37:32.542 --> 37:33.459
I'm sure you can.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.587
But people are obsessed
with class here.

37:35.628 --> 37:36.984
Still, really?

37:36.985 --> 37:38.339
Yes, yeah, absolutely.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.299
It's our measure
of authenticity.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.095
So people are always
trying to bust people.

37:43.136 --> 37:43.824
"He's a toff!"

37:43.825 --> 37:44.512
you know.

37:44.554 --> 37:45.680
What is a toff?

37:45.722 --> 37:47.265
An aristocrat, yeah.

37:47.266 --> 37:48.808
Aristocrat? Right.

37:48.850 --> 37:52.395
My friend Adrian wrote a book
called "The Angry Isle,"

37:52.437 --> 37:54.564
and he talks about how
the British are famous

37:54.606 --> 37:59.757
for being polite, apologizing
a lot, but that that actually

37:59.758 --> 38:01.320
masks a deep anger.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.322
Do you think there's any
truth to that at all?

38:03.364 --> 38:04.734
Well, I think... because
I've been spending

38:04.741 --> 38:07.326
a lot of time in California,
which is, you know...

38:07.368 --> 38:09.061
And so when you... when
you come to London...

38:09.079 --> 38:12.249
If you come to London for
a month, you won't make

38:10.956 --> 38:13.708
any friends, and you probably
won't find anywhere to go,

38:13.750 --> 38:16.162
- but after that, the best people
- you've ever met in your life.

38:16.169 --> 38:19.422
When I went to LA, that first
month, I was so popular.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.217
Everyone's... I started,
like, six bands, and then,

38:22.218 --> 38:23.051
nothing comes of it.

38:23.093 --> 38:26.178
There's a kind of real first
impression thing... -Right

38:26.179 --> 38:28.347
...that doesn't go anywhere.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.976
In London, it's just get
it done and deal with it.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.435
Right.

38:32.477 --> 38:33.979
Well, hey!

38:34.020 --> 38:35.521
See, here we go.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.690
We're closing, closing.

38:36.691 --> 38:39.651
[indistinct] closing...
Get [indistinct] some.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.237
Staggering news is
now sinking in.

38:42.279 --> 38:44.363
Markets are giving
a brutal reaction.

38:44.405 --> 38:47.408
When the world seems like
it's spinning out of control,

38:47.450 --> 38:50.182
and the inside of your skull
feels like it's being gnawed on

38:50.183 --> 38:51.037
by angry wolverines.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.249
The sun has risen on a
completely different UK

38:54.291 --> 38:55.625
and a completely different EU.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.377
When you wake up still
tasting tequila,

38:58.419 --> 39:01.673
feeling shame, fear, and
regret in equal measures,

39:01.714 --> 39:04.530
it's good to have a friend...
Europe's weaker,

39:04.531 --> 39:07.053
Britain's divided,
where do we go now?

39:07.095 --> 39:09.848
...who, without judgment, gives
you a shoulder to cry on

39:09.889 --> 39:15.394
and maybe a simple good thing,
like some eggs and sympathy.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.190
I'm horribly and
savagely hungover.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.440
That's very unlike you.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.483
I was feeling shame, and
regret, -and mourning...

39:21.484 --> 39:23.278
Yeah, you're not the only one.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.654
Don't know what's happening.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.073
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some eggs in Purgatory.

39:27.115 --> 39:28.407
Why Purgatory?

39:28.449 --> 39:31.203
Because they're in chili
sauce and tomatoes,

39:31.244 --> 39:32.411
special hangover cure.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.288
I know you need it.

39:33.289 --> 39:34.122
I... yes.

39:34.164 --> 39:37.459
Now, do you know about the
delicacy -of fried slice?

39:37.460 --> 39:38.584
No.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.296
English delicacy which is
like British bruschetta,

39:41.338 --> 39:42.401
you fry plastic bread.

39:42.402 --> 39:43.464
Uh-hmm.

39:43.506 --> 39:46.509
I've got some really
good beef dripping.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.408
Kind of magical.

39:49.409 --> 39:50.429
Pure grease.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.640
It's a... I... that's what
I need right now.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.100
Yeah.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.062
I think that's how
everyone felt a bit

39:57.103 --> 39:59.064
after the referendum too.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.558
I think there's something
very strange about you

40:00.565 --> 40:03.693
because you look normal but
it's all going on inside.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.029
Yes, you have got a slight
pleading look in your eyes.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.948
I do. It's a... Okay, the
whole point of this is,

40:08.990 --> 40:11.450
the plastic bread
soaks in all the fat.

40:11.492 --> 40:12.911
Right.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.287
So when you eat it, it bursts
with grease in your mouth.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.664
It's that good.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.416
I like the noise.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.815
Here, I'm gonna give it to you.

40:21.816 --> 40:24.547
It may still be a bit
runny I like runny.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.547
I need runny today.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.341
Okay.

40:26.383 --> 40:29.072
Just try a bit dry first, so
you can just get the fats

40:29.073 --> 40:30.469
going into your mouth.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.679
Hmm.

40:31.721 --> 40:34.182
There is light and hope
in the universe again.

40:34.224 --> 40:35.878
- Thank you.
- That's what I aim to provide.

40:35.892 --> 40:40.438
Spice, runny eggs, and
grease, just what I needed.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.086
Hmm, so good.

40:43.087 --> 40:44.483
I have something absolvent.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.861
You know that thing in "The
Simpsons" once when he wants

40:46.862 --> 40:49.072
to put on weight so he
doesn't have to go to work?

40:49.114 --> 40:51.908
And he allows himself to eat
things that when you rub it

40:50.531 --> 40:53.201
on something it makes it
go see-through, like that.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.493
"Your window to weight gain."

40:54.535 --> 40:57.455
Yes, here, here,
just make this turn

40:57.456 --> 40:59.374
see-through now if you want.

40:59.416 --> 41:02.210
I can see myself in
about six months.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.962
I do feel quite pleased
that we can be

41:04.003 --> 41:05.297
a corrupting influence.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.132
That's something that
we can be proud of.

41:10.551 --> 41:13.512
These are frightening
times for many.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.724
The world is changing,
and there is no stopping

41:15.725 --> 41:16.808
those changes.

41:16.849 --> 41:20.812
But in such times, there
are always two ways to go,

41:20.853 --> 41:25.358
run and hide, build walls,
cower in fear and suspicion,

41:25.400 --> 41:28.674
point the finger at our
neighbors, look, like desperate,

41:28.675 --> 41:32.031
frightened people do,
for someone to blame,

41:32.073 --> 41:35.910
or stand up and try... at least
try to build a better world,

41:35.952 --> 41:39.205
to look for, instead of a
man on a horse to save us

41:39.247 --> 41:43.501
or a wall to keep us apart,
to our better angels.
