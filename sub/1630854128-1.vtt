00:04.091 --> 00:06.832
OK, this is the moment
of truth, Dr. Marcel.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.660
If there's a chance she could
lose function in her hands,

00:08.704 --> 00:09.966
she'd be against it.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.054
Knowing your mother,
I'd agree.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.360
Let's get her off the table.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.839
Come on.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.015
How could you do this to me?

00:15.058 --> 00:17.278
Your life was on the line.

00:17.321 --> 00:20.063
I know that we have history,
but it is history.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.022
We could try starting fresh.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.675
New neighbors.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.026
<i>Your father never
wanted you to know.</i>

00:26.069 --> 00:27.418
We were in love.

00:27.462 --> 00:30.421
You're the one
who should have this.

00:30.465 --> 00:33.337
Vanessa's biological father,
I loved him at the time.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.948
What happens if those old
feelings are still there?

00:35.992 --> 00:38.429
I'm so happy to see you.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.127
Will, the Vas-COM trial.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.042
Please tell me you're
not going to testify.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.043
I have to.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.174
And what about me?

00:44.218 --> 00:45.436
You're going to ruin my life.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.568
They're going to
throw me in jail.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.439
Let go of me.

00:48.483 --> 00:49.527
<i>I used to be a cop.</i>

00:49.571 --> 00:50.833
Inside, I'll always bleed blue.

00:50.876 --> 00:53.444
<i>It wasn't my idea
to drag you in.</i>

00:53.488 --> 00:56.056
I can't wait
for this case to be over.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.101
The building's on fire.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.189
You need to get out.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.712
You lying bitch.

01:00.756 --> 01:01.713
No!

01:03.759 --> 01:05.543
Take the back stairs!

01:05.587 --> 01:06.414
All right.

01:06.457 --> 01:07.632
Let's get him out of here.

01:12.594 --> 01:16.554
Let's get back in the room.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.165
One, two, three.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.087
Ah!

01:30.264 --> 01:31.961
Hey, up here!
Up here!

01:32.004 --> 01:33.441
Hermann!
- Hey, Will!

01:33.484 --> 01:34.964
We need the basket.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.618
On it.
Hey, grab me the skid.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.884
Will, need a hand
over here, man.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.973
I don't think he's going
to last much longer.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.496
Any other way out of here?

01:45.540 --> 01:49.805
Just both stairwells,
but CFD's coming up.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.808
Let's get him by the window.

01:56.464 --> 01:59.336
Slide the curve to his feet.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.122
You guys OK?

02:02.165 --> 02:03.253
Yeah, yeah.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.341
- Clip the straps.
- Yeah.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.690
Grab him by the feet.

02:05.734 --> 02:06.865
We're going to
pull them through.

02:06.909 --> 02:07.910
OK.
Yeah.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.564
One, two, three.
Good job.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.218
Clip him up.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.263
We're going to swing him around
counterclockwise, all right?

02:15.222 --> 02:17.659
And one, two, three, go.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.185
Hey, Roy!
Skid's coming down.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.317
You got it?
- On the way!

02:23.360 --> 02:25.449
One, two, three.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.147
All right.
Let's go.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.104
Slide him down.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.279
Stay low.

02:29.323 --> 02:30.846
Let's go. Skedaddle.

02:34.719 --> 02:35.633
Let's go!

02:35.677 --> 02:38.462
Go!

02:40.856 --> 02:42.771
Ahh!

02:49.908 --> 02:51.475
Hey, Will, Dylan,

02:51.519 --> 02:53.390
hey,
you guys should be on oxygen.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.349
Yeah. Yeah.

02:59.396 --> 03:02.225
- Hannah?
-  I'm OK.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.444
I thought you got out.

03:03.487 --> 03:06.186
No, I--

03:06.229 --> 03:09.101
I went back in to find you.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.846
Your lungs are clear.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.544
Anybody seen Milena?

03:16.587 --> 03:19.895
As far as CFD can tell, no
one else is in the building.

03:19.938 --> 03:20.852
I got to find her.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.249
What we got?

03:26.293 --> 03:27.381
Male, mid-30s.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.773
GSW to the abdomen.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.340
GCS 3t.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.950
Extracted from structure fire
with an inhalation injury.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.691
Dr. Asher's in the next
ambo with Dr. Halstead.

03:33.735 --> 03:34.866
All right.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.216
Dr. Taylor and I
will take this guy.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.521
You take Hannah.
- OK.

03:37.565 --> 03:40.568
All right, let's go.
Come on. On my count.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.787
Ready?
One, two, three.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.619
Bilateral breath sounds.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.360
Get me an X-ray, chest,
and belly, please.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.448
BP 98/68.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.538
Heart rate 130.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.148
Single hole,
left upper quadrant.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.193
This guy's in trouble.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.674
Let's roll him.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.153
Second hole, right back.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.198
Through and through.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.199
Let's hope.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.244
Laparotomy?

04:04.287 --> 04:05.549
Yeah.

04:05.593 --> 04:08.160
Let's see how bad
the damage is.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.597
Any time.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.554
X-ray.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.990
OK, no retained missiles.

04:12.034 --> 04:14.297
Two units whole blood
and prep the hybrid OR.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.646
On it.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.869
Jo!

04:22.784 --> 04:25.308
Jo?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.789
Dylan?

04:30.008 --> 04:30.966
Oh, man.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.446
You've been hit.

04:32.489 --> 04:33.403
We got-- we got to get
you to the hospital.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.578
- Dylan.
- Yeah.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.409
It's not your fault.

04:39.453 --> 04:40.889
Come on, Jo.

04:40.932 --> 04:44.501
Stay with me.

04:44.545 --> 04:48.331
You're gonna be OK,
all right?

04:48.375 --> 04:49.941
You're going to be OK.
Hello?

04:49.985 --> 04:51.029
This is Dr. Scott.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.641
I need an ambulance stat.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.216
So you had a mild
inhalation injury,

05:04.260 --> 05:05.914
but you responded well
to the supplemental O2.

05:05.957 --> 05:09.309
How high was her CO level?

05:09.352 --> 05:12.224
Peaked at 12, but now
it's back to normal.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.617
How are you feeling?

05:13.661 --> 05:14.966
Good.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.273
Can I get dressed now?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.753
Yeah, I guess so.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.712
Well, if you want
to take a couple hours...

05:21.756 --> 05:25.499
Will, thanks, but I'm fine.

05:25.542 --> 05:26.717
Oh, what about Dylan?

05:26.761 --> 05:27.979
Did he find Milena?

05:28.023 --> 05:30.373
Yeah, but it's
not looking great.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.722
Oh, god.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.469
Hey, you all right?

05:39.513 --> 05:40.818
Yeah.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.298
You could use
some cleaning up.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.692
I've got to testify
at the Vas-COM trial today.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.521
All my clothes,
everything, it's gone.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.653
I'll see if I can
scrounge up a clean shirt.

05:49.697 --> 05:52.656
It's Milena.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.354
Tracy, let's go.

05:54.397 --> 05:55.485
Follow me.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.970
Lost pulse and went
systolic on the monitors.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.667
Yeah, she's bleeding
from everywhere.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.147
Let me take over.
All right.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.149
Maggie, hit her
with a milligram of epi,

06:07.192 --> 06:08.498
one of calcium,
an amp of bicarb,

06:08.542 --> 06:10.413
and keep transfusing.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.328
Come on.

06:13.764 --> 06:16.463
Does her pulse check?

06:17.855 --> 06:18.813
No pulse.

06:18.856 --> 06:19.857
She's asystole.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.337
Give her another round.

06:24.296 --> 06:26.037
Open her chest.

06:29.954 --> 06:30.912
It's no use.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.653
She's coagulopathic.

06:32.696 --> 06:36.308
Then another round.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.397
Come back, Jo.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.792
Come on.
Come back, Jo.

06:47.145 --> 06:49.278
We lost her, Dylan.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.368
We lost her.

06:56.154 --> 06:59.244
Jo.

07:10.517 --> 07:14.129
Time Of Death, 8:04.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.007
She's gone.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.140
I'm so sorry.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.605
It was my fault.
- It was not your fault.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.041
I shot the gun.

07:57.085 --> 07:59.043
Dylan, you were being
attacked, all right?

07:59.087 --> 08:00.741
There was an assailant.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.264
How could you know the bullet
was going to go through him

08:02.307 --> 08:03.613
and hit Milena?
How could you know that?

08:03.657 --> 08:05.006
Her name was Jo.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.181
And you were trying
to protect her.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.749
I did a hell of a job, man.

08:08.792 --> 08:13.362
Buddy,
you did the best you could.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.104
I killed her.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.280
I killed the woman I love, man.

08:21.631 --> 08:24.939
Oh, god.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.816
I wouldn't go in
there if I were you.

08:32.860 --> 08:33.991
She's still upset?

08:34.035 --> 08:35.950
Livid is the word I'd use.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.474
What's her prognosis?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.171
Since she hasn't yet
rescinded power of attorney,

08:40.215 --> 08:41.651
I suppose I can share.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.827
She's going to Brooks
Emmerich in Boston.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.089
In my opinion,
it's the best neuro

08:45.133 --> 08:46.569
rehab center in the country.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.831
In all likelihood,
she'll come back from this.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.529
Good.
Thank you.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.618
Hey, Sam.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.968
You understand why I
opted to sack the vessel?

08:54.011 --> 08:57.188
I understand,
but your decision was--

08:57.232 --> 09:01.149
well, uninspired is the
kindest thing I can say.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.368
And personally, I've
struggled not to take offense.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.413
Offense?

09:04.456 --> 09:05.893
Yeah.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.547
Clearly, you doubted
I could make the repair.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.419
Oh, believe me, that
had nothing to do with it.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.726
You say so.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.815
Oh, and not that
this had anything

09:14.858 --> 09:17.208
to do with your decision,
but it is ironic

09:17.252 --> 09:19.776
the way you managed to sideline
the chief of transplant,

09:19.820 --> 09:23.650
some might say making room
for the next rising star.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.312
Hey.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.706
He's waiting
to hear about Goran.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.882
I can't imagine what
Dylan's going through.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.972
I know.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.846
Ms. Goodwin,
can I have a word?

09:45.889 --> 09:48.675
Oh. Sure.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.157
Look, I know this is
probably the last thing you

09:53.201 --> 09:56.073
need today,
but I I'd like to be taken

09:56.117 --> 09:58.685
off the transplant service.

09:58.728 --> 09:59.686
Taken off?

09:59.729 --> 10:00.991
Yes.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.211
After all
the time and money that

10:03.254 --> 10:04.908
has gone into your training?

10:04.952 --> 10:09.913
After having, in effect,
a fellowship

10:09.957 --> 10:12.133
with our premier
transplant surgeon?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.134
I have my reasons.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.614
Well, I'm sure you do.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.355
And I'm guessing it's
personal and not related

10:17.399 --> 10:18.748
to your competence in the OR.

10:18.792 --> 10:19.749
That's right.

10:19.793 --> 10:20.924
Well, the answer is no.

10:20.968 --> 10:21.925
Whoa, Ms. Goodwin.

10:21.969 --> 10:22.970
Hold on.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.493
Look, look, no, no, no.

10:24.536 --> 10:30.325
Dr. Marcel, I know all
about Dr. Blake's surgery,

10:30.368 --> 10:34.111
and I suspect you
feel a need to atone

10:34.155 --> 10:36.461
for the decision you made.

10:36.505 --> 10:40.030
But do you have
any idea what it would

10:40.074 --> 10:44.121
cost to replace you,
to recruit a top-notch

10:44.165 --> 10:46.123
transplant surgeon?

10:47.255 --> 10:48.778
No, you don't.

10:48.822 --> 10:54.697
And we are not about to
start turning away patients.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.699
No, no, no, no.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.701
Uh-uh.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.530
You are on the
transplant service.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.492
Wait, deliberate?

11:07.536 --> 11:08.537
You're sure?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.191
No question.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.149
We found traces of accelerant
at the base of both stairways.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.150
Excuse me.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.239
The fire, it was arson?

11:15.283 --> 11:17.154
Goran's the most
likely suspect.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.461
Could have wanted to flush
Milena out, got trapped.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.028
We won't know for
certain until we check

11:21.071 --> 11:23.813
security cameras in the area.

11:23.857 --> 11:28.557
Thanks.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.514
I'm sorry, Will.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.081
And I brought all this on you.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.909
Please, you don't
need to apologize.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.695
Yeah, but had I not
asked you to let her stay--

11:35.738 --> 11:37.087
Dylan, come on.

11:37.131 --> 11:40.395
My loss was nothing
compared to yours.

11:40.438 --> 11:41.831
I'm fine.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.703
I just feel for you.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.541
Dr. Marcel and I
are in complete agreement.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.500
The patient's hilum
is not reconstructable.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.544
His liver's shot.

11:59.588 --> 12:00.632
Sorry.

12:00.676 --> 12:01.764
No pun intended.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.679
He's going to
need a transplant.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.464
I'll put him on the list, OK?

12:06.508 --> 12:07.770
Hold on.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.250
He might die before
that happens.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.251
Yeah.

12:10.294 --> 12:11.818
What a loss.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.908
I'll donate.

12:14.951 --> 12:15.778
What?

12:15.822 --> 12:16.997
I said I'll donate.

12:17.040 --> 12:17.998
Oh, come on.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.042
Hey, Dylan.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.609
Look, I get it.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.654
But you're in no condition
to make a decision like this.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.787
I can't let him die.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.310
What's your blood type?

12:26.354 --> 12:27.311
A positive.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.312
Well then, that's that.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.574
He's B negative.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.968
Well, then we have to find
a donor.

12:32.012 --> 12:35.450
You do not give up, do you?

12:35.493 --> 12:38.627
Dr. Marcel, your case.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.544
We'll do my best, OK?

12:47.027 --> 12:51.814
Looks like that breakfast
burrito is getting cold.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.381
You know,
I forgot all about it.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.994
You know,
I tried to talk to Dylan?

12:58.038 --> 12:59.866
Did you know he was
in love with her?

12:59.909 --> 13:03.434
Like, grief on top
of grief, you know?

13:03.478 --> 13:04.740
- Yeah.
- What can you say?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.525
Well, what could anybody say?

13:07.569 --> 13:09.136
Brutal though, right?

13:09.179 --> 13:12.356
So who are you
talking to these days?

13:12.400 --> 13:13.836
What do you mean?

13:13.880 --> 13:16.839
Well, you know, after
all that Lonnie business,

13:16.883 --> 13:19.276
I thought you'd look
for another therapist.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.712
You know what?

13:20.756 --> 13:23.759
I haven't, um, I haven't
really been looking.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.154
- No?
- Uh-uh.

13:27.197 --> 13:31.158
Hey, doesn't the
Vas-COM trial start today?

13:31.201 --> 13:34.291
Subject changer.

13:34.335 --> 13:37.555
Yes, it starts this afternoon.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.080
Good luck with that.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.041
Maggie.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.651
Look who's here.

13:46.695 --> 13:47.696
Grant.

13:47.739 --> 13:48.915
Hello, Maggie.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.046
He wanted to see
where I worked.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.047
Oh.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.135
Sorry.

13:52.179 --> 13:53.397
It's kind of a sad day
for us here.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.921
Yeah, Vanessa told me.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.183
Are you getting coffee?

13:56.226 --> 13:57.445
You should join us.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.055
You know, I didn't
realize how late it was.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.927
I have to get back to the ED.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.493
Another time, then.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.017
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.501
Thanks for coming, Dad.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.286
Oh, hey.

14:12.329 --> 14:13.635
Hey, I'm sorry about Jo.

14:13.678 --> 14:14.941
I know you were close.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.378
Yeah.

14:17.421 --> 14:20.642
Look, Dad, I need a favor.

14:20.685 --> 14:21.904
Can you call
the head of narcotics,

14:21.948 --> 14:23.471
get me the yellow
file on Goran?

14:23.514 --> 14:25.473
I need to see if he's
got any relatives nearby.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.170
- Relatives?
- Yeah.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.216
He needs a liver transplant,
and I've got to find a match.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.913
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, Dylan.

14:30.957 --> 14:31.783
Don't you think you're
going through an awful lot

14:31.827 --> 14:33.089
for this guy?

14:33.133 --> 14:34.917
He's my patient,
and I've got to do

14:34.961 --> 14:36.876
at least one thing right.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.098
OK.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.932
Dr. Archer, 17-year-old
boy, David Sullivan,

14:49.976 --> 14:51.629
was brought in last night.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.631
Smoked marijuana
laced with fentanyl.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.111
Narcaned in the field.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.591
Resident put him on saline
to flush his system.

14:56.634 --> 14:57.635
OK.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.028
Treatment 6.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.290
Here's his latest drug panel.
- All right.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.335
Thank you.

15:01.378 --> 15:04.555
Yeah.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.600
Can you sit up?
Try to sit up.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.210
What's going on?
Where am I?

15:07.254 --> 15:08.255
David, I'm Dr. Archer.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.647
I'll be treating
your son today.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.475
- Thank you.
- Where am I?

15:11.519 --> 15:12.868
Stop saying that.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.610
Look, you know perfectly
well where you are.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.481
This-- this isn't
like him, all right?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.483
David's not some pothead.

15:19.527 --> 15:20.963
His labs are good.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.139
Drugs have pretty much
cleared his system.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.445
Who are you?

15:24.488 --> 15:25.881
Hey, he's your doctor.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.752
They said the marijuana
had fentanyl in it.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.406
Your son might
not even have known.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.539
We're seeing a lot of cannabis
sprayed with fentanyl.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.193
You could have died, David.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.324
Are they coming?

15:34.368 --> 15:35.543
Are who coming?

15:35.586 --> 15:37.719
He's still high.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.460
His THC levels
are negligible,

15:39.503 --> 15:42.985
but we'll keep him on an IV,
make sure we flush his system.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.117
I'm not listening to you!

15:44.160 --> 15:45.683
Hey, hey, David. Hey.

15:45.727 --> 15:46.989
What is going on with you?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.164
I'll check back
in a little while.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.645
OK. Thank you.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.995
Hey.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.041
Can you page
Dr. Charles, please?

15:55.084 --> 15:58.261
Yeah.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.223
Hannah?

16:03.266 --> 16:05.877
I can't catch my breath.

16:05.921 --> 16:06.878
All right.

16:06.922 --> 16:07.879
We'll get you in a room.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.751
Ethan!
- Let me help.

16:09.794 --> 16:10.882
Hey.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.362
She's dyspnic and wheezy.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.363
OK.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.451
Will, I got this.

16:14.495 --> 16:17.063
No, I'm staying.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.543
100 milligrams of SOLU-MEDROL
and a breathing treatment.

16:19.587 --> 16:20.588
Yeah.

16:20.631 --> 16:21.632
Why wheezing?

16:21.676 --> 16:23.373
Why now?

16:23.417 --> 16:24.722
Inhalation injury was minimal,
and the CO wasn't that high.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.420
I don't know.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.812
Until we can figure this out,
I think we should intubate.

16:27.856 --> 16:28.900
Just saying--

16:28.944 --> 16:30.293
- No, please.
- Yeah.

16:30.337 --> 16:31.903
She's setting at 92
with the cannula.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.209
Maybe we don't need to.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.689
Please.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.865
She doesn't want it.

16:36.908 --> 16:39.781
This isn't
what I'd recommend.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.391
All right.

16:41.435 --> 16:42.610
We'll see if you can pull
through without intubation,

16:42.653 --> 16:44.351
but I want a chest CT.

16:44.394 --> 16:45.961
Mags, order a blood gas
and let radiology

16:46.005 --> 16:47.223
know we're coming up.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.920
Will do.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.400
Sit tight, OK?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.492
You're too close to her.
You can't be objective.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.059
You need to back off.
- We're not together.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.539
It doesn't matter.

16:58.582 --> 17:01.063
You were, and feelings
just don't disappear.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.720
Even a banana. I think
it would be good for you.

17:06.808 --> 17:07.765
Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan?

17:07.809 --> 17:09.550
You again.

17:09.593 --> 17:12.379
You know, David,
I don't think we met.

17:12.422 --> 17:15.164
I'm Dr. Charles,
and this is Dr. Cuevas.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.339
You're psychiatrists?

17:16.383 --> 17:17.340
Yes.

17:17.384 --> 17:18.776
- Stay away from me.
- OK.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.256
Oh, god.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.649
He doesn't need a psychiatrist.
He doesn't need a--

17:21.692 --> 17:22.606
no,
he smoked some pot.

17:22.650 --> 17:23.912
That's it.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.348
And it was stupid.
I admit that.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.784
You know, especially
for someone who's earned

17:26.828 --> 17:28.438
early admission to Stanford.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.266
Oh, well,
that's pretty impressive.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.834
Hey, David,
I see you haven't eaten yet.

17:32.877 --> 17:35.793
Honey, the doctor's
talking to you.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.839
It's poison.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.059
David, it's--
it's not poison.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.756
I want to go home.

17:41.799 --> 17:42.974
Well, if you hadn't done what
you did in the first place,

17:43.018 --> 17:44.280
we wouldn't even be here.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.368
Eric,
that's not helping right now.

17:45.412 --> 17:46.978
Stop.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.458
David, I want you to know
that we completely understand

17:48.502 --> 17:50.808
that this can be a really
uncomfortable place,

17:50.852 --> 17:52.506
and we want you
to know that we're

17:52.549 --> 17:55.900
going to try and get you out of
here as soon as possible, OK?

17:55.944 --> 17:57.554
OK.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.643
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

17:59.687 --> 18:03.038
Nice to meet you.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.128
Dr. Cuevas,
this is Dean Archer.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.652
He is the head of the ED.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.220
Nellie is starting
a psych rotation today.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.004
Another lamb
to the slaughter.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.616
Hardly a lamb, Dr. Archer.

18:15.659 --> 18:16.791
Sorry.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.446
So what's going on
with the kid?

18:19.489 --> 18:21.056
What are you thinking?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.798
He's paranoid, exhibiting
persecutory delusions.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.844
It isn't just what he said
but his body language,

18:26.888 --> 18:28.194
refusal to make eye contact.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.412
Yeah.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.153
The question is,
is it chemically induced,

18:31.197 --> 18:32.894
or is there something
else going on here?

18:32.937 --> 18:34.374
Well, if it is chemically
induced, it should resolve.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.810
Yeah.

18:35.853 --> 18:36.941
In the meantime,
we got to get a better

18:36.985 --> 18:39.161
history from the parents.
- Yeah.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.733
I'm seeing ground
glass opacities.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.604
And an enlarged
pulmonary artery.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.867
She's definitely got
interstitial disease.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.782
But what is causing it?

18:51.826 --> 18:52.914
We need to get
a bronchoscopy,

18:52.957 --> 18:54.481
clean out her lungs.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.830
They can take a biopsy,
see if we can find out.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.488
Hannah!

19:01.531 --> 19:04.621
She's only sating at 83.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.884
Get respiratory in here.

19:06.928 --> 19:07.929
We got you, Hannah.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.974
We got you.
OK?

19:10.018 --> 19:11.106
Just relax.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.326
There you go.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.547
I'm in.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.638
We should have intubated
her downstairs.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.778
Look, I was upset earlier,
but I don't want you

19:30.821 --> 19:32.301
to get the wrong impression
about David.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.694
I mean, he is a great kid,
and we're very proud of him.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.783
You know, this whole
business with the marijuana,

19:35.826 --> 19:37.088
that's way out of character.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.655
He was such a Sweet,
happy child.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.222
You know, everyone would
always compliment us

19:40.266 --> 19:41.702
on how good his manners are.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.617
And up until now,
I mean, he's been

19:43.660 --> 19:44.618
a straight-A student.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.663
So his grades
have fallen off?

19:46.707 --> 19:47.795
Just recently.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.840
Any other changes
in his behavior

19:49.884 --> 19:50.972
that you can think of?

19:51.015 --> 19:52.234
Anything at all come to mind?

19:52.278 --> 19:56.673
Well, I guess
he's quieter lately.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.153
Quieter?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.764
Sometimes, he seems
off in his own world.

20:00.808 --> 20:04.855
I mean, he spends a lot
more time alone in his room.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.641
Well, you don't notice it so
much because you're at work.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.425
OK, so he's been spending
more time alone.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.166
What about-- what
about friends?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.864
Does he have a group of buddies
he normally hangs out with?

20:13.908 --> 20:15.214
I don't know.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.867
I mean, he doesn't
bring anyone home.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.392
You know, I guess he's just
more of a loner these days.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.916
Yeah, but I mean, that's
true for a lot of kids, though.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.701
You know, since COVID,
and the online classes

20:24.745 --> 20:26.007
and the socializing.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.748
Sure.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.184
I mean, the pandemic has been
really rough on young people,

20:29.228 --> 20:30.707
for sure.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.187
But you haven't noticed
anything different?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.623
I don't know.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.538
Some-- OK, I'll get
up at night sometimes,

20:35.582 --> 20:38.237
and I'll see that the light
in his room's still on.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.803
Well, yeah.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.718
I guess that's why David
sleeps so much on the weekends.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.285
He's just not
getting enough rest.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.026
So sleeping
habits have changed?

20:45.069 --> 20:48.072
Oh, I mean, this is all
normal teenage stuff, right?

20:48.116 --> 20:49.726
Very possibly.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.076
But honestly, we would really
appreciate it if you would

20:52.120 --> 20:54.688
give us permission to have
another quick conversation

20:54.731 --> 20:56.342
with David just to help us
figure out,

20:56.385 --> 20:59.910
you know, what's going on
and maybe what isn't.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.738
We certainly don't want
this to happen again.

21:01.782 --> 21:02.739
No.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.393
We don't.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.744
I guess if you think
that it will help.

21:07.788 --> 21:08.919
Great.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.182
Thank you.
- All right.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.749
Dr. Scott.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.011
Dr. Marcel.

21:14.055 --> 21:17.711
Bogdan Costavich,
Goran's brother.

21:17.754 --> 21:18.755
He's B negative.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.235
A match.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.368
He's agreed to donate
a lobe of his liver.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.848
Well, Mr. Costavich,
this is very generous.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.285
I just want to make
sure you understand

21:26.328 --> 21:27.721
what it is you're agreeing to.

21:27.764 --> 21:30.027
This is-- well, it's
not a simple procedure.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.115
Yes.

21:31.159 --> 21:32.203
Dr. Scott explained to me.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.944
Yeah.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.598
There's risk involved, and it
might be as long as two months

21:35.642 --> 21:36.991
before you're able
to go back to work,

21:37.034 --> 21:39.428
so just keep that in mind.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.778
Goran and I,
we went different ways.

21:41.822 --> 21:45.869
I know he's done bad things,
but he's my brother.

21:45.913 --> 21:46.914
I understand.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.569
Please, Crockett.

21:49.612 --> 21:50.570
Yeah.

21:50.613 --> 21:51.962
All right.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.355
Dr. Scott here is going
to get you prepped, OK?

21:53.399 --> 21:56.924
I'll see you in there.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.145
Hey.

22:01.189 --> 22:04.801
Here's her biopsy.

22:04.845 --> 22:09.371
Talc crystals embedded
in periarterial granulomas.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.242
Look, on the street,

22:11.286 --> 22:14.942
heroin is
often cut with talcum powder.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.074
When she used,
the talc formed emboli,

22:17.118 --> 22:18.728
which went into her lungs.

22:18.772 --> 22:22.253
So she's had these
granulomas for years.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.908
Obviously,
she's been able to get by.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.475
But the smoke last night

22:26.519 --> 22:27.868
triggered the interstitial disease

22:27.911 --> 22:31.698
and caused the inflammation.
- Yeah.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.091
Hey, she's on steroids
right now.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.137
Let's see how she responds.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.268
OK.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.880
All right.

22:46.234 --> 22:47.757
Grant.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.237
I got your text message.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.152
Maggie, I was hoping
I could catch you.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.545
OK.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.329
You seemed uncomfortable
this morning.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.330
Was it because of me?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.201
No, no, no, no, no.

22:57.245 --> 23:01.467
Look, I was very happy to
bring you and Vanessa together.

23:01.510 --> 23:06.123
And it meant a lot to me,
too, to see you again.

23:06.167 --> 23:09.170
I felt the same way.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.867
Tell me, Maggie,
you ever wonder

23:10.911 --> 23:12.652
what it would have been like
if we'd just run off together?

23:12.695 --> 23:14.871
I mean, if our parents
hadn't found out and--

23:14.915 --> 23:16.220
Grant.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.396
I mean,
if they hadn't made us

23:17.439 --> 23:19.441
put the baby up for adoption.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.051
Of course I do.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.966
But that's not what happened.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.537
I'm married, Grant.

23:28.581 --> 23:30.626
And I'm very happy,
and I love my husband.

23:30.670 --> 23:34.021
And you have a
relationship with Vanessa now,

23:34.064 --> 23:36.066
and that's fine.
That's good.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.807
But I can't be a part of that.

23:37.851 --> 23:38.765
I'm sorry.

23:42.769 --> 23:43.639
Dr. Marcel.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.554
Yeah.
Get him prepped.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.295
I'll be right there.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.123
Going into this
transplant, I hope there's

23:49.166 --> 23:50.820
no residual resentment.

23:50.864 --> 23:51.865
I'm a surgeon.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.606
The patient needs me.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.869
On top of that, I'm doing this
for Dylan, so no, Ms. Goodwin.

23:55.912 --> 23:56.870
No resentment.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.219
Glad to hear it.

23:58.262 --> 23:59.742
As you know,
the hospital is obligated

23:59.786 --> 24:02.092
to have a senior
surgeon supervising,

24:02.136 --> 24:05.705
and since Dr. Jones will be
resecting the donor liver,

24:05.748 --> 24:07.141
he can take that role.
- Yeah.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.403
Yeah, that's fine.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.100
I also came
to tell you that we're

24:10.144 --> 24:13.626
experiencing another shortage
of packed red blood cells.

24:13.669 --> 24:17.238
I can only allow this
patient seven units.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.500
Ms. Goodwin,
a surgery like this

24:18.544 --> 24:20.067
is usually
allotted 10 to 20 units.

24:20.110 --> 24:23.636
Yes, I'm aware, but we
can't have any one patient

24:23.679 --> 24:24.898
depleting our supplies.

24:24.941 --> 24:27.596
We have other surgeries,
other patients.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.989
So call another hospital.

24:29.032 --> 24:29.946
I need that blood.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.078
I've tried.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.776
We're all in the same boat.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.257
So you keep me in
transplant but tie my hands?

24:36.300 --> 24:38.433
I'm sorry, Dr. Marcel.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.740
Seven units.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.963
So, David, do you know
why you're here?

24:47.007 --> 24:49.444
Can you remember
what happened at all?

24:49.488 --> 24:50.837
Why should I talk to you?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.839
Well, you don't have to, actually.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.406
But we're really just
trying to help you.

24:57.147 --> 25:00.237
Dad said the pot was bad.

25:00.281 --> 25:06.243
When you smoked it, were you
alone or with some friends?

25:06.287 --> 25:07.506
What difference does it make?

25:07.549 --> 25:08.724
Maybe none at all.

25:08.768 --> 25:11.771
But I mean,
just out of curiosity,

25:11.814 --> 25:14.208
were you hang
with your crew, or...

25:14.251 --> 25:16.602
People are stupid.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.647
Certainly can be.

25:18.691 --> 25:22.651
Let me ask you, have you
noticed anything different

25:22.695 --> 25:24.784
about yourself, about--

25:24.827 --> 25:26.655
I don't know, the way you--

25:26.699 --> 25:29.876
the way you think, about the
way you feel about things?

25:29.919 --> 25:31.312
Anything at all?

25:31.355 --> 25:32.487
I think maybe--

25:34.445 --> 25:37.144
I know.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.973
David?

25:40.016 --> 25:44.586
You're trying
to read my mind.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.154
Is there someone in here
who's telling you that?

25:47.197 --> 25:49.199
What?
No.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.549
I'm not crazy.

25:50.592 --> 25:51.724
You know what?

25:51.767 --> 25:54.074
Sometimes I have this--

25:54.117 --> 25:58.513
this little voice in my head
that's trying to tell me stuff,

25:58.557 --> 25:59.993
and I actually get confused.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.996
I lose track of whether is
that me talking to myself,

26:03.039 --> 26:04.693
or is it someone else?

26:04.737 --> 26:09.959
Does that ever happen to you?

26:10.003 --> 26:11.613
OK.

26:11.657 --> 26:15.835
And-- and does that voice
ever tell you to do things?

26:20.143 --> 26:22.929
Yes.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.365
Not to trust you.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.585
OK.

26:29.588 --> 26:34.027
There's something wrong
with me, isn't there?

26:34.070 --> 26:36.464
You know, pal, we're
going to figure it out.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.074
OK?

26:38.118 --> 26:40.120
You can trust me on that.

26:43.514 --> 26:44.994
OK, so we know what
we're looking at.

26:45.038 --> 26:48.650
His affect, disordered
thinking, the voices.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.043
Now we can move forward.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.914
We can start
a course of treatment.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.655
I think we need to take a
little breath here, Doctor.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.136
The patient is a minor,
which means that it's

26:56.179 --> 26:59.182
his parents who are going to
be determining how we proceed,

26:59.226 --> 27:01.707
so I hope that you were
observing them as closely

27:01.750 --> 27:03.056
as you were David.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.800
Dr. Marcel, how's it going?

27:07.843 --> 27:09.192
Good.

27:09.236 --> 27:12.108
Just the hepatic anastomosis
has taken some work.

27:12.152 --> 27:15.546
Both the native artery and the
donors' are a little short.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.765
You're using a
parachute technique

27:16.809 --> 27:17.897
to bring them together.

27:17.940 --> 27:18.941
Yeah.

27:18.985 --> 27:19.768
OK, good.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.117
Holler if you need me.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.466
OK.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.468
Almost got the
arteries together.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.122
How are his vitals?

27:26.166 --> 27:27.863
BP's starting to tank.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.430
Where we at on pressers?

27:29.473 --> 27:30.823
- Maxed out.
- Fluid resuscitation?

27:30.866 --> 27:32.128
Same.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.477
Let's hang another
unit of packed cells.

27:33.521 --> 27:34.435
Can't.
That was our seventh.

27:34.478 --> 27:35.523
We're out.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.394
He's getting acidotic.

27:37.438 --> 27:38.613
Crockett?

27:38.657 --> 27:42.138
Yeah, almost there.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.706
One more.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.187
OK, hepatic artery
anastomosis complete.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.710
BP 87/56.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.277
Should I transfuse
more platelets?

27:50.320 --> 27:51.539
Yeah.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.149
And 90 mgs per
kg of Factor VII.

27:53.193 --> 27:54.194
Why?

27:54.237 --> 27:55.238
Got to get him clotting.

27:55.282 --> 27:56.675
Get me some Evarrest.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.632
We're gonna go ahead
and pack and get out.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.068
Pack?
No.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.156
You have to complete the
bile duct anastomosis.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.157
No.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.506
He's lost too much blood.

28:02.550 --> 28:03.856
Gotta get him clotting
now, or we'll lose him.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.727
Maybe you should
call Dr. Jones.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.163
I know what I'm doing.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.817
We pack him, recycle
what blood he's lost,

28:08.861 --> 28:10.514
and wait to complete
the transplant.

28:10.558 --> 28:11.733
You can't stop the surgery.

28:11.777 --> 28:12.908
I have to.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.301
Believe me,
it's the only option.

28:14.344 --> 28:15.302
All right, lap pads.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.303
Let's go.

28:16.346 --> 28:17.565
Come on.

28:17.608 --> 28:18.566
There it is.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.220
Keep going.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.313
Hey, Dan.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.794
The new psych fellow's
looking for you.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.143
Oh.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.405
Yeah, thanks.

28:31.448 --> 28:35.583
We were able
to diagnose that kid.

28:35.626 --> 28:36.627
It's funny.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.586
I think that
Dr. Cuevas is taking

28:38.629 --> 28:41.284
a certain satisfaction in
being able to put a name on it.

28:41.328 --> 28:42.721
I mean, I get that.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.461
I was like that when
I was starting out.

28:44.505 --> 28:48.117
But you know, there's
a little more to it.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.162
Yeah.

28:49.205 --> 28:51.294
So what is the diagnosis?

28:51.338 --> 28:53.688
- Schizophrenia.
- Ahh.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.691
I mean, we have to follow
up and confirm and all that,

28:56.735 --> 28:58.171
but I'm--

28:58.214 --> 29:00.173
I'm pretty sure it's
what we're looking at.

29:00.216 --> 29:01.565
Yeah.
Have you told the parents?

29:01.609 --> 29:05.352
Not yet.

29:05.395 --> 29:08.355
I tried to call
my son yesterday.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.009
Didn't know you had a son.

29:10.052 --> 29:11.924
Yeah.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.883
15 years ago,
lost him to drugs.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.537
He's alive. I don't--

29:16.580 --> 29:20.149
I just don't know where he is.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.586
- Sorry to hear that, Dean.
- Yeah.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.850
I'm telling you this
because I know what it's going

29:24.893 --> 29:26.460
to be like for those parents.

29:26.503 --> 29:27.809
Boy.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.725
Oh, they're going to
remember that laughing kid

29:30.769 --> 29:33.032
running through the sprinklers,
how proud he was

29:33.075 --> 29:35.034
when he learned
how to ride a bike.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.645
And they are not
going to understand

29:37.688 --> 29:40.213
how it's possible
that some outside force

29:40.256 --> 29:43.520
has stolen that boy away.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.089
Whew.

29:47.133 --> 29:50.005
Oh...
you know that.

29:50.049 --> 29:52.399
Yeah.

29:52.442 --> 29:55.924
Well, I gotta go tell them.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.404
Gotta go tell the parents.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.841
Well, like you always say,
at least now

29:59.885 --> 30:02.017
he'll get the help he needs.

30:02.061 --> 30:05.716
Let's hope so.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.550
OK, let's unpack him.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.773
You got it?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.514
Great.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.908
Thank you.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.518
OK, no active bleeding.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.346
Marty?

30:26.389 --> 30:27.913
Vitals are steady.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.305
Looks like it worked.

30:29.349 --> 30:30.785
Hell of a call, Crockett.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.874
All right.
Good job, everyone.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.833
Let's wrap this up.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.880
So Dr. Cuevas
and I have a strong hunch

30:38.924 --> 30:41.883
about what could be causing
David's difficulties.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.276
Is it really such a mystery?

30:43.319 --> 30:45.104
I mean, it seems like just
normal adolescent stuff.

30:45.147 --> 30:46.757
I know you've noticed his--

30:46.801 --> 30:49.935
his odd comments,
his jumbled thoughts.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.675
His fearfulness.

30:51.719 --> 30:53.460
You-- you think that there's
something wrong with David?

30:53.503 --> 30:56.724
We think David is
suffering from an illness.

30:56.767 --> 30:59.596
We'd like him to see one of
our outpatient psychiatrists.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.337
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.817
Another psychiatrist?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.515
It's just part of
the evaluation process.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.170
I don't understand.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.258
This isn't making any sense.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.825
What is going on?

31:10.869 --> 31:13.784
We know that you love
your son very much,

31:13.828 --> 31:15.395
and this might not
be easy to hear,

31:15.438 --> 31:17.179
but we believe that
David is developing

31:17.223 --> 31:19.878
a schizoaffective disorder.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.357
What?

31:21.401 --> 31:22.532
Mentally ill?

31:22.576 --> 31:23.707
No.

31:23.751 --> 31:24.708
Psychotic?

31:24.752 --> 31:25.927
No!

31:25.971 --> 31:27.624
No, we're taking
David home right now.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.148
How can you
say that about him?

31:29.191 --> 31:29.975
This is a
treatable condition.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.324
How?

31:31.367 --> 31:32.760
We have a much
better understanding

31:32.803 --> 31:34.022
of the mechanism--
- My boy isn't crazy.

31:34.066 --> 31:35.719
You're the ones that are crazy.

31:35.763 --> 31:36.895
I think if we can just--
can we please talk about this?

31:36.938 --> 31:38.287
No.
No.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.289
Look, we don't want
anything to do with you.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.334
Stay away from us.

31:41.377 --> 31:42.683
We should sue you.

31:45.773 --> 31:49.081
Oh, my god.

31:49.124 --> 31:51.431
I mean, I've had patients
with schizophrenia before,

31:51.474 --> 31:54.782
but I've never had to break
the news to the parents.

31:54.825 --> 31:58.481
Sadly, their reaction
is not uncommon.

31:58.525 --> 32:02.311
Well, how is that boy
supposed to get any help?

32:02.355 --> 32:04.444
Exactly.

32:08.404 --> 32:10.189
Come in.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.233
Ms. Goodwin.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.714
Dr. Scott.

32:13.757 --> 32:16.021
I wanted to let you know,
Goran's

32:16.064 --> 32:18.327
transplant is going well.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.416
Dr. Marcel thinks
he'll pull through.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.722
Well, good.

32:21.765 --> 32:24.072
I know how much
that means to you.

32:24.116 --> 32:26.031
I'm sorry, I have to run out.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.555
I have the Vas-COM trial.

32:28.598 --> 32:34.343
I also wanted to tell you
I'm leaving MED.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.736
What?

32:35.779 --> 32:38.173
You once reminded me
that I wear

32:38.217 --> 32:40.175
a white coat, not a blue one.

32:40.219 --> 32:44.527
But the thing is,
here in Chicago,

32:44.571 --> 32:47.835
I don't think I'll ever
be able to escape my past.

32:47.878 --> 32:50.620
I don't think I'll ever be able
to take that blue coat off.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.231
But Chicago's your home.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.667
You grew up here.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.886
Yeah, that's the problem.

32:55.930 --> 33:00.065
Those old ties keep
pulling me back in.

33:00.108 --> 33:04.939
I have to go someplace where
I can just be a doctor.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.463
So--

33:07.507 --> 33:09.857
Well,
you will be sorely missed.

33:09.900 --> 33:13.643
Is there any way I can
talk you out of it?

33:16.646 --> 33:21.956
This is where I met Jo,
and where I lost her.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.396
So every time I go past
that room,

33:27.440 --> 33:30.095
I think of her, and--

33:30.138 --> 33:34.490
Understood.

33:34.534 --> 33:38.016
It has truly been
my pleasure, Dr. Scott.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.717
Wow.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.066
Extubated.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.589
RSBI was normal.

33:46.633 --> 33:49.157
Passed her breathing
trial with flying colors.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.986
Talc granulomas.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.422
Heroin addiction.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.816
A gift that keeps giving.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.948
The pulmonologist will
get your lungs cleaned up.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.037
You'll be fine.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.517
Yeah, till the next thing.

34:01.561 --> 34:04.564
I just can't seem
to shake the past.

34:04.607 --> 34:09.438
Hey, you're not in this
alone, Hannah, OK?

34:09.482 --> 34:10.874
Excuse me.

34:10.918 --> 34:16.054
Dr. Halstead,
you and I have a date in court.

34:20.319 --> 34:22.408
Where did you get
that outfit?

34:22.451 --> 34:24.758
Maggie dug it out
of the lost and found.

34:24.801 --> 34:25.846
Yeah?

34:25.889 --> 34:27.543
Well, she didn't
do you any favors.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.241
Jessa Rinaldi,
we're placing you under arrest.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.285
What?

34:30.329 --> 34:31.547
Don't say anything.

34:31.591 --> 34:32.809
You're charged
with aggravated arson

34:32.853 --> 34:34.072
and one count
of attempted murder

34:34.115 --> 34:35.377
against Dr. Will Halstead.

34:35.421 --> 34:36.596
Oh, come on.
What the hell is this?

34:36.639 --> 34:38.250
This is absolutely ridiculous.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.903
We have credit card
evidence of your client buying

34:39.947 --> 34:41.601
accelerant plus
surveillance camera footage

34:41.644 --> 34:43.472
of her entering
and leaving the building

34:43.516 --> 34:46.910
immediately before the fire.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.913
Let's go.

35:02.012 --> 35:04.667
I thought Sam told you
I didn't want to see you.

35:04.711 --> 35:07.148
He did.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.802
But I have something
I need to say.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.325
Look, if you
came to apologize--

35:10.369 --> 35:11.935
I didn't.

35:11.979 --> 35:14.068
I came to thank you.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.724
I had a win in the OR today,
largely because of you,

35:17.767 --> 35:20.030
what you taught me.

35:20.074 --> 35:22.729
It made me realize, I--

35:22.772 --> 35:27.081
I have an obligation
to continue this work,

35:27.125 --> 35:29.910
that I can't throw away the
knowledge you've given me.

35:31.999 --> 35:36.177
Very nice speech, Crockett.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.788
Meanwhile, I'm sidelined
with this injury.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.095
I know.

35:41.139 --> 35:46.187
When I come back,
which I will,

35:46.231 --> 35:49.321
if you think you're going to
be on my team, think again.

35:53.890 --> 35:57.807
All right.

35:57.851 --> 36:01.898
You know, if it had
been me on the table,

36:01.942 --> 36:04.292
and it was you who
had to make the call,

36:04.336 --> 36:07.208
I'm pretty sure you would've
done the same thing.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.214
Good night, Pamela.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.350
So I don't know
if he mentioned it,

36:18.393 --> 36:22.441
but I actually did my
residency with your partner

36:22.484 --> 36:23.485
way back when.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.878
A little before your time.

36:24.921 --> 36:30.100
But anyway,
so you know I had to part

36:30.144 --> 36:34.366
company with my therapist
about two months ago.

36:34.409 --> 36:37.673
And I don't know,
lately I've just been really

36:37.717 --> 36:39.545
missing the interaction.

36:39.588 --> 36:45.420
And then today, I just
had this brutal day, and--

36:45.464 --> 36:46.856
I'm sorry.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.468
I just have to
ask you a few questions.

36:49.511 --> 36:50.556
Do you smoke?

36:50.599 --> 36:51.644
No.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.255
Take any recreational drugs?

36:54.299 --> 36:56.083
No.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.607
Do you have a gun
in the house?

36:58.651 --> 37:01.262
No, I do not.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.177
OK.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.790
So you were saying that today
was particularly difficult?

37:07.834 --> 37:11.794
In what way was it difficult?

37:11.838 --> 37:13.405
Hmm?

37:28.637 --> 37:31.423
April?

37:31.466 --> 37:32.424
Ethan.

37:32.467 --> 37:33.860
Hi.

37:33.903 --> 37:40.301
I, um, I saw
your dad's obituary.

37:40.345 --> 37:44.871
I-- I would have come
to the service, but I--

37:44.914 --> 37:48.266
I wasn't sure.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.877
I mean, I didn't want
it to be awkward, so--

37:50.920 --> 37:51.965
No.

37:52.008 --> 37:55.360
Um, are you back in Chicago?

37:55.403 --> 37:57.187
Yeah. Yeah.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.973
I finished my NP program.

38:00.016 --> 38:04.630
I'm working with a
medical group here, so...

38:04.673 --> 38:05.674
What about you?

38:05.718 --> 38:07.633
Are you all better?

38:07.676 --> 38:10.375
Yeah, pretty much.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.029
Guess my NFL career
is over, but--

38:15.031 --> 38:16.642
How's the family?

38:16.685 --> 38:18.296
Emily, the baby?

38:18.339 --> 38:20.428
Well, he's probably
huge by now.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.909
Not a baby anymore, no.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.867
But good.

38:24.911 --> 38:27.957
They're really good.

38:28.001 --> 38:31.047
You didn't get married
or anything, did you?

38:32.919 --> 38:36.618
No.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.925
Did you?

38:38.968 --> 38:41.536
No.

38:46.411 --> 38:51.416
Um,

38:51.459 --> 38:54.157
well,
I will see you around.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.422
Yeah.

39:22.621 --> 39:23.796
Yeah.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.624
<i>Hello.
You have a call from...</i>

39:25.667 --> 39:27.277
<i>Sean Archer.</i>

39:27.321 --> 39:29.541
<i>And inmate
at Cook County Jail.</i>

39:29.584 --> 39:30.542
<i>Will you accept?</i>

39:30.585 --> 39:31.717
Yes.

39:31.760 --> 39:35.416
Absolutely.

39:35.460 --> 39:39.072
Dad?

39:40.552 --> 39:41.553
.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.343
.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.440
Dylan.

39:59.484 --> 40:00.920
Hey, Dylan.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.575
Wait up.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.141
It wasn't Goran.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.317
It was Jessa.

40:07.361 --> 40:08.580
What?

40:08.623 --> 40:09.842
The fire.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.452
Goran had nothing
to do with it.

40:11.496 --> 40:15.630
Jessa from Vasik, she was
the one who started it.

40:16.936 --> 40:18.503
Oh.

40:18.546 --> 40:22.202
Yeah, Ms. Goodwin
told me you were leaving.

40:22.245 --> 40:23.769
I know you've been
through a lot,

40:23.812 --> 40:25.510
but if your decision had
anything to do with the fire--

40:25.553 --> 40:26.467
It didn't.

40:26.511 --> 40:29.470
You know what?
I appreciate it.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.473
