03:05.853 --> 03:06.842
He's a hockey player?

03:06.937 --> 03:08.017
No, he's a superhero.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.767
He's coughing up blood
because he probably
broke a rib

03:10.900 --> 03:13.266
and punctured a lung
while breaking
someone else's rib

03:13.361 --> 03:15.272

He had
three teeth knocked out

why I think your theory

04:10.000 --> 04:12.161
is not just wrong
but ill-conceived,

04:12.294 --> 04:16.287

by having you check
the stool for blood.

don't have to.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.160
Maybe she said
I was a dead war hero.

13:50.247 --> 13:53.489
Raised by a lunatic mother
and abandoned by his father.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.040
Oh, I know,
squirrel handcuffs.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.493
You think he's
got any of those?

13:57.587 --> 14:00.078
If you really
wanted me to do nothing
with this information,

14:00.215 --> 14:01.330
then why did you
give it to me?

14:01.425 --> 14:03.757
Because you were
pining for a kid

14:03.844 --> 14:06.426
and you deserved to know
that you already had one.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.505
But your paternal cravings
are more theoretical than
appHed.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.432
You want vicarious
immortality

14:12.519 --> 14:14.931
more than you want
a lifelong burden.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.933
You're assuming
he's gonna be
a nightmare.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.764
What if he's
a good kid?

14:18.859 --> 14:22.772
He's a kid.
Best you can hope for
is he's a nightmare.

14:22.904 --> 14:27.022
House, I'm not naive.
I realize that this thing
could go very badly,

14:27.117 --> 14:30.951
but the point is
my son wants to meet me,
and I want to meet him.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.513
Popo, I presume.

15:06.364 --> 15:09.731
Hey. I let myself in.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.942
This is...
We've met.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.491
I thought the whole
point of this was to
get away from Popo.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.083
My dad's getting
a cyst removed

15:20.170 --> 15:22.627
and my mother had to
take him to the clinic.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.921
Don't worry,
she'll be gone
in an hour.

15:25.008 --> 15:28.045
I'm not worried
becauseits
not my issue.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.594
She seems
awfully quiet.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.546
You haven't
seen her drunk.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.686
(BOBBY SOBBING)

15:48.698 --> 15:49.858
TAUB: Bobby?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.489
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

16:05.215 --> 16:07.297
I found him crying
in the fetal position.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.590
CHI: It's not
a new symptom.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.333
He's crying because
his liver failure

16:10.428 --> 16:11.508
threw his hormones
out of whack.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.757
Aside from the crying,
he's actually
recovering nicely.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.426
TAUB: Aside from the guy
in the book depository,

16:15.517 --> 16:18.099
the Kennedys had
a lovely trip to Dallas.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.343
Repetitive blows
to the head

16:19.437 --> 16:21.894
can cause chronic
traumatic encephalopathy,

16:22.023 --> 16:24.355
the symptoms of which
are aggressive behavior
and depression.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.478
So your theory is
that his aggressive
behavior

16:26.570 --> 16:28.185
caused his
aggressive behavior?

16:28.280 --> 16:30.316
He's not depressed,
he's just bummed,

16:30.407 --> 16:32.238
because he knows
he's a talentless moron

16:32.367 --> 16:35.074
who's only
one lost fight away
from being a barista.

16:35.871 --> 16:38.738
I understand that
can get to a guy
after a while.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.411
If he quits
being an enforcer,
it could save his life.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.283
You don't want
to save his life.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.619
You want to
kill his career.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.425
I moved into
Chase's apartment.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.005
He knows.
He was staring at
our matching cups.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.257
I told you
we should have split up.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.474
We're not having sex.
With each other.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.969
Yet.
Yes.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.140
Yes?

17:03.481 --> 17:08.100
I just mean no one
knows the future right now,
so we don't really know...

17:11.615 --> 17:15.904
The only conclusive test
for CTE is post-mortem.

17:15.994 --> 17:19.202
TAUB: But an MRI
of his brain could reveal
white matter disintegrity,

17:19.289 --> 17:21.746
which is
the effect of CTE.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.573
Why? Are you trying
to sleep with her?

17:23.668 --> 17:25.829
'Cause a simpler technique
is just to ask.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.793
l was doing
something nice.
No.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.665
That doesn't fit.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.086
He's only had
three concussions
since he was 10.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.418
It's not enough
to cause CTE.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.173
Three reported
concussions.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.297
These guys are
taught in high school
how to dupe the tests.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.639
Guilt?
This is really insulting.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.931
It's not guilt.
Park is a friend.

17:44.648 --> 17:45.728
So it's guilt.

17:45.815 --> 17:50.400
Chase convinced you
to leave Mommy and now
he feels responsible.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.277
No MRI.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.151
Do a psych eval, if he
doesn't start weeping
again, send him home.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.663
Dr. Wilson?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.000
Duncan?

18:10.340 --> 18:11.796
James.

18:11.883 --> 18:14.090
Nice to meet you.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.047
It's nice to meet you.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.382
Um...

18:22.686 --> 18:23.641
How are you doing?

18:23.728 --> 18:24.843
Good.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.351
Good.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.896
I got you this.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.103
Oh.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.363
Thank you.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.366
Go ahead.
Okay.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.365
It's got three
games built-in,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.200
but you can download
more from the website.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.203
I know.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.421
You already have one.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.419
I can always
use a backup.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.292
Hi. Can I start you
with something to drink?

18:57.387 --> 18:58.877
Just water, please.

19:00.056 --> 19:03.219
You got a GameDeck?
Way to go, Dad.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.600
According to
your psych eval,

19:09.691 --> 19:13.149
the only thing
happier than you
is Disneyland.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.101
I'm sorry you had
to see me like that
last night.

19:15.238 --> 19:19.607
I'm just upset about
being in the hospital,
I'm on some weird meds.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.405
But they must be working,
because I'm feeling
a lot better now.

19:24.164 --> 19:28.624
Depression could be
the symptom of a
serious illness, CTE.

19:28.752 --> 19:31.789
Yeah. My aunt
sends me every article
she can find on it.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.001
Then you know
it could kill you.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.829
In the long run,
like a lot of things.

19:34.924 --> 19:35.913
You might be right.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.125
And an MRI
could confirm that.

19:38.261 --> 19:42.755
l have enough
evidence of head trauma
in my file already, so...

19:46.102 --> 19:50.937
My mom said you had trouble
maintaining relationships
with normal people.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.933
She also said
you were a nice guy.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.643
I always figured
she was lying

19:56.738 --> 19:58.774
'cause she didn't
want me to hate
my deadbeat dad.

19:59.824 --> 20:00.939
I didn't know.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.616
I know, now.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.664
You're a bright kid.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.750
Thanks to you.
Thanks to my mom,

20:12.837 --> 20:14.702

soft-hearted wuss.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.038

20:16.132 --> 20:18.123
I think you may
have gotten that
from both of us.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.639
I got to go,
but it was really
nice meeting you.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.470
It was nice
meeting you, Duncan.

20:29.312 --> 20:30.427

20:30.647 --> 20:31.682
You want to
hang out again?

20:32.148 --> 20:33.228

20:33.316 --> 20:35.022
Absolutely.
Tonight?

20:36.653 --> 20:38.143
Tonight?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.646
Well, I... There's...

20:44.494 --> 20:45.574
That would be great.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.825
Okay. I'll text you.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.418
(DOOR OPENS)

20:57.590 --> 20:59.967
Thank you. How'd you
talk him into it?

21:00.051 --> 21:03.043
He agreed once
I promised him
anonymity.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.845
Mr. and Mrs. Doe
liked the name John,
apparently.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.674
Unfortunately,
we just wasted his time
and proved House right.

Nothing?

That's an artifact.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.518
That's a density.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.317
I know you think
I'm convincing myself,

21:19.404 --> 21:21.611
but this brain has
been hammered for years,

21:21.698 --> 21:25.065
meaning evidence
may be subtle,
but it's there.

HOUSE: The good news
is it's isolated
ophthalmoplegia,

21:56.691 --> 21:58.352
which means he
didn't have a stroke.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.856
Bad news is
Taub was right.
You're still sick.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.025
I said "right",
not "competent".

22:05.783 --> 22:08.820
Bursts your CTE bubble.
You're gonna need
a whole new theory

22:08.912 --> 22:11.369
to keep Uncle Jesse
and his Olsen Twins
on the bench.

22:11.456 --> 22:14.664
Can we discuss
my incompetence
somewhere else?

22:16.544 --> 22:19.456
Dr. House.
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

22:38.483 --> 22:40.019
Could be neurosyphilis.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.189
He's only 22.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.435
And he's been
on the road
since he was 14.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.897
So he was trash even
before he was trash?

22:46.991 --> 22:48.652
Are you curious
about what he wanted?

22:48.743 --> 22:50.825
I assume he wanted me
off the case,

22:50.912 --> 22:53.324
and you told him
I was hit in the head
as a child,

22:53.414 --> 22:56.326
and your mother
made you promise
to take care of me.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.453
He was doing
what he always does.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.831
Sticking up for
the little guy.

23:02.507 --> 23:04.293
He told me to
apologize to you,

23:04.384 --> 23:07.876
or he would
excrete down my throat.

23:08.638 --> 23:09.718
I'm paraphrasing.

23:09.806 --> 23:12.343
So if he should ask,
I was a gentleman,

23:12.433 --> 23:14.048
or I will excrete
down your throat.

TAUB: We should start
plasmapheresis immediately.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.648
We need to
run an ANCA panel
to confirm first.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.726
Putting him
on plasmapheresis could
make him bleed out.

We may not have time
before it reaches
his lungs.

23:29.659 --> 23:34.198
I think you're right,
thus confirming
my objectivity.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.161
Start the treatment.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.174
Miserable yet?

23:49.596 --> 23:53.680
He's polite, well-adjusted,
and a straight-A student.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.928
Which means
he doesn't need you.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.558
is still
in the cocoon stage.

24:00.690 --> 24:01.975
I'm making him dinner.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.182
You don't make
an 11-year-old dinner.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.859
You give him a jar
of peanut butter.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.026
It'll be fine.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.275
I could give this kid
a quinoa salad

24:10.366 --> 24:11.697
and he would eat it
just to be nice.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.400
'Cause he's
a gutless placater,
just like his dad.

24:14.537 --> 24:15.572
He's nice.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.363
This is a terrible idea.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.493
Because we like
each other?

24:19.584 --> 24:23.247
Yes.
Because of the statement,
"We like each other."

24:23.379 --> 24:24.664
You've known him
25 minutes.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.463
All you know about him
is that he'd lie
about a quinoa salad,

24:27.550 --> 24:28.790
whatever the hell
that is.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.175
You're jealous
of an 11-year-old

24:32.263 --> 24:34.549
because you are
an 11-year-old.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.772
So tell me
about yourself.

24:48.905 --> 24:52.363
I mean you're smart,
you're nice,
but what else?

24:52.450 --> 24:54.782
I don't know.
I'm a kid.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.986
Right.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.456
What are you
looking for?

25:03.336 --> 25:04.667
Nothing.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.748
You want peanut butter?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.591
Do you have
prosciutto?

25:14.347 --> 25:16.053
You like prosciutto?
I'm weird.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.722
No! No, I like it, too.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.762
I've got some
in the fridge.
How about goat cheese?

25:21.104 --> 25:22.184

the best pizza
Ieverhad.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.368
It was the hint
of Dijon.

25:40.206 --> 25:43.698
Do you have any
aunts or uncles
or grandparents?

25:44.627 --> 25:47.369
My mom got into
some stupid fight
with my grandfather.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.839
They all kind of
cut us off.

25:48.923 --> 25:49.912
Hmm.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.963
Are you talking
to your parents?

25:52.051 --> 25:57.296
Yes, and they're
going to be very surprised
and excited to meet you.

26:48.733 --> 26:53.602
I had my own
plastic surgery practice,
making lots of money.

26:53.696 --> 26:57.689
But I wasn't happy.
It wasn't what I went
to med school for.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.581
(SIGHS)

27:10.713 --> 27:15.833
Every winter, my dad
would flood the backyard
and make a rink.

27:15.927 --> 27:18.509
I was Lemieux,
my little brother
was Gretzky.

27:18.596 --> 27:23.386
I was good. I won
the NDHA scoring title
three years in a row.

27:24.477 --> 27:28.311
I kept getting bigger
and stronger and better.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.649
Until I didn't.

27:32.235 --> 27:35.443
My Juniors coach told me
that if I wanted to stay
on the team,

27:35.571 --> 27:37.948
that I'd have
to use my size.

27:38.908 --> 27:41.524
Every game, I got
less and less ice time,

27:41.619 --> 27:46.158
until it was all fighting
and no hockey.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.747
There's something
going on with my arms.

27:58.803 --> 28:02.637
I can't feel them! Doctor,
I can't feel my arms.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.300
Patient's arms
are now paralyzed.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.814
ANCA panel was negative.
It's not MPA.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.350
Lyme disease
could cause paralysis,

28:12.441 --> 28:14.272
if he was hunting,
he'd be exposed to ticks.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.102
No target rash
or cardiac involvement.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.610

28:22.785 --> 28:24.821

I played with
Park's Popo.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.824
Is that
two separate events?

28:27.957 --> 28:30.664
Her grandmother.
ALS could explain
the symptoms.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.784
Sensory involvement
rules out ALS.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.210
Okay, now this
is interesting.

28:34.297 --> 28:35.787
We'll get back
to the patient
in a second.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.838
Your issue is
the same as Wilson's.

28:37.967 --> 28:41.835
Except you're haunted
by the pitter-patter
of tiny skanks.

28:41.971 --> 28:44.508
You don't feel guilty
about getting Park
thrown out of her home.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.507
You feel guilty about
all the women that
you've screwed over.

28:47.643 --> 28:50.350
My mother
needs 1,000 bucks
for snow tires.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.731
Park's a friend,
Popo's fun.

28:52.815 --> 28:55.773
Paralysis has gone
from his face to his arms,

28:55.860 --> 28:59.603
meaning it's descending,
which is the hallmark
of botulism.

29:00.156 --> 29:03.444
So it was
something he ate.
How innocuous.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.741
You've overcome your
bias by reversing it.

29:05.828 --> 29:08.285
The only problem is
that being in love
with the patient

29:08.372 --> 29:10.954
is just as judgmental
as being in hate.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.031
We didn't find
any contaminated...

29:12.126 --> 29:14.242
No contaminated food,
I'm not an idiot.

29:14.337 --> 29:17.579
But what if it's
not from ingesting,
but from injecting?

29:17.673 --> 29:20.756
He was treated for
intractable muscle spasms
by the team's trainers.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.959
Sometimes they use Botox.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.922
We need to
start the antitoxin.

29:25.014 --> 29:27.005
The antitoxin could
cause anaphylaxis.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.055
We need to test first
to confirm.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.470
HOUSE: As if
to prove my point.

29:30.561 --> 29:33.098
Last time
you said there wasn't
enough time to test

29:33.189 --> 29:34.725
prior to a more
dangerous treatment.

29:34.857 --> 29:37.519
It's a different situation,
a different symptom,
a different diagnosis.

29:37.652 --> 29:40.894
Different emotion.
Give him the antitoxin.

29:47.328 --> 29:48.943
Anything?

29:49.038 --> 29:50.528
No adverse effects.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.710
Chase let me move in
with him to get away
from my grandmother,

30:05.846 --> 30:09.930
then he practically
let my grandmother move in
with the both of us.

30:10.059 --> 30:13.096
He's being way
more than nice.

30:13.521 --> 30:14.636
(SIGHS)

30:14.730 --> 30:16.186
Then which
answer is it?

30:16.273 --> 30:19.185
Chase feels guilty
for pushing you
to move out?

30:19.276 --> 30:20.436
He didn't push me.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.400
Guilt about skanks?
He loves skanks.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.736
It's not
the other option.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.022
There are people
that like me,

30:26.117 --> 30:27.823
people who even
want to sleep with me.

30:27.910 --> 30:30.071
Some of them are
even good looking.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.569
That good looking?

30:36.919 --> 30:38.034
Did you see that?

30:45.594 --> 30:46.720
You're feeling
something?

30:48.431 --> 30:49.546
Yeah.

30:53.728 --> 30:56.470
I could give you
crap for making me
wait 11 years,

30:56.605 --> 30:57.981
but instead
I'm gonna thank you

30:58.065 --> 31:01.273

wait another 11.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.353

to clean up after it.

You think I'm gonna
quit on this?
On an 11-year-old?

31:09.827 --> 31:12.113
The only relationship
you haven't quit on
has been with me.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.695
Hmm. A needy,
truculent narcissist.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.953
I think it's been
the perfect training
for parenthood.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.914
That's not even close.

31:22.465 --> 31:24.296
This is the rest
of your life.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.841
If you screw this up,
you don't get to run away.

31:29.013 --> 31:30.469
You get to ruin
both your lives.

31:30.598 --> 31:32.008
This is a bigger
responsibility

31:32.099 --> 31:35.637
than any you've
ever taken on,
and screwed up.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.144
I know.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.936
That's why I'm so
excited about it.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.289
after I beat
someone up.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.717
It's the only time
I know I'm safe.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.928

ever felt that way?

32:13.015 --> 32:14.095
I'm not going back.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.172

33:02.231 --> 33:04.142
I say that not because
there's no treatment
for MLD,

but because
it's a bad fit.

Prion disease could
explain the waxing

33:10.072 --> 33:11.573
The test for prions
is a brain biopsy.

33:11.699 --> 33:14.486
And given his history,
there's got to be
brain swelling.

33:14.577 --> 33:16.693
We can't risk drilling
into his skull.

33:16.787 --> 33:17.902

she means well.

So why shouldn't
I take you off all my cases?

people who didn't like me
because I'm short,

36:10.085 --> 36:11.165
people who didn't like me
because I'm Jewish.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.710
Yeah, I get it,
there's a long list of
reasons not to like you.

36:13.797 --> 36:17.415
You relentlessly mock,
but it's not for
self-aggrandizement,

36:17.509 --> 36:20.842
it's because ideas are
bigger than feelings.

36:22.765 --> 36:25.051
At least that's what
I choose to believe.

36:25.142 --> 36:29.101

had the side effect
of desensitizing me.

you walk away.

The plasmapheresis
played through the whistle.

We gave it to him for MPA,
but when he got worse,
we took him off.

37:37.881 --> 37:40.372
When he got better,
we thought it was
the antitoxin,

37:40.509 --> 37:43.342
but it was actually
the plasmapheresis
still working.

just the wrong diagnosis.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.488
Chillax, Dad.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.616
Can you do
an Australian
accent?

40:23.505 --> 40:24.836
(CHUCKLES)

40:27.843 --> 40:29.083
(SIGHS)

40:40.355 --> 40:42.516
I just got the call.

40:43.525 --> 40:46.437
Three-year deal,
2.1 million.

40:54.369 --> 40:58.362
What about
the flooded backyard and
pretending to be Lemieux?

40:59.374 --> 41:01.285
That's why I took it.

41:02.169 --> 41:04.876
After all I did
to get here,

41:04.963 --> 41:07.340
half a dream is
better than nothing.

41:10.052 --> 41:13.965
Maybe my new coach will see
what my Juniors coach didn't.

41:17.684 --> 41:19.015
That'd be nice.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.240
I'm not sleeping
with you.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.706
That's a shame.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.095
This is about Popo.

41:55.806 --> 41:59.219
She's not sleeping
with me either, right?

41:59.309 --> 42:02.096
You were jealous
of me, my family.

42:10.612 --> 42:14.070
Maybe you've got too much
and I've got too little.

42:22.624 --> 42:25.366
I might sleep
with you after all.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.246
(SOUL MUSIC PLAYING)

42:56.533 --> 42:58.990
The woman that I called,
that was really Beth?

42:59.619 --> 43:01.610
Found her
on Facebook.

43:03.165 --> 43:05.747
Nothing.
She's still
pissed at you.

43:07.627 --> 43:09.037
Can you pass
the bacon?

43:09.129 --> 43:11.336
lthoughtyou
liked prosciutto.

43:11.423 --> 43:13.414
Nobody likes
prosciutto.
