WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:06.174
-Sweet! -Holy smokes.
-GARY: 1600s.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Yes, this is really cool.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.210
I've never seen you so excited.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.811
It means something!

00:10.844 --> 00:13.381
Here's hard evidence people
were on this island

00:13.414 --> 00:18.519
120 years before the discovery
of the Money Pit.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.720
RICK:
The drill bar is stuck.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.659
-RICK: We've hit an obstruction.
-MARTY: This is so serious.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.096
This is the first step in
shutting down the whole island.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.768
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic...

00:34.802 --> 00:38.372
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.406 --> 00:41.775
for more than 200 years.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.678
So far, they have found
bits of gold chain...

00:44.712 --> 00:49.483
...a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...

00:49.517 --> 00:53.254
even a 17th century
Spanish coin.

00:53.287 --> 00:57.825
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.858 --> 01:03.464
And, according to legend,
one more will have to die,

01:03.497 --> 01:06.167
before the treasure
can be found.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.817
As a new day begins
on Oak Island...

01:23.851 --> 01:25.419
Hey, Terry.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.555
...Oak Island partner,
Craig Tester--

01:27.588 --> 01:29.490
along with his stepson,
Jack Begley--

01:29.523 --> 01:31.225
check in with geologist,

01:31.259 --> 01:33.894
Terry Matheson on
the morning's progress.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.498
-Which well are we on?
-EF-9.5.

01:37.531 --> 01:41.369
-EF-9.5. -EF-9.5, we've moved
a little north and east

01:41.402 --> 01:44.405
and we're down 75 feet.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.575
NARRATOR: In their determination
to pinpoint the exact location

01:47.608 --> 01:49.843
of the original Money Pit
treasure shaft...

01:49.877 --> 01:52.780
the team is employing
what is referred to as,

01:52.813 --> 01:54.848
"the Geo-Tech system."

01:54.882 --> 01:57.485
This will involve the drilling
of as many as 40

01:57.518 --> 02:00.854
six-inch wide boreholes
to depths of up to 200 feet

02:00.888 --> 02:03.191
in a carefully
marked grid pattern.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.164
To date, Brewster Drilling
has completed ten holes--

02:10.198 --> 02:12.166
but there is still no sign

02:12.200 --> 02:14.268
of the centuries-old
treasure vault.

02:14.302 --> 02:18.706
-Okay, this will be H-3.5.
-Yeah.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.474
And the main thing

02:20.508 --> 02:24.178
we're looking here is
a potential debris field.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.746
So, if the Money Pit
was over there

02:25.779 --> 02:27.615
when the collapse happened,
there was a tunnel

02:27.648 --> 02:29.750
and the treasure could have shot
into that tunnel.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.519
We know a lot of debris
went into the tunnel,

02:31.552 --> 02:33.554
we know wood went
into the tunnel.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.423
So we know a lot of stuff

02:35.456 --> 02:37.191
from the original Money Pit
went in there.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.526
Did the treasure?
We don't know,

02:38.559 --> 02:39.893
so that's what
we'll be looking for.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.729
But we'll take it down;
I mean, we don't know what,

02:41.762 --> 02:44.265
-what might be down deeper.
-That's right.

02:44.298 --> 02:47.635
-We'll see what happens.
-Yup, so, okay, sound's good.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.571
NARRATOR:
As each borehole is drilled,

02:50.604 --> 02:53.341
the soil, clay and debris
taken from the hole

02:53.374 --> 02:57.611
is collected and deposited
onto a shaker deck.

02:57.645 --> 03:01.449
These so-called spoils are then
carefully examined by hand,

03:01.482 --> 03:04.718
and methodically recorded.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.954
Then, after the drill
reaches bedrock--

03:06.987 --> 03:10.291
at a depth of
approximately 200 feet--

03:10.324 --> 03:12.860
the metal casing in each hole

03:12.893 --> 03:15.729
is replaced
with plastic PVC pipe

03:15.763 --> 03:18.499
to prevent the hole
from collapsing.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.435
This will also allow for
later inspection of the holes

03:21.469 --> 03:24.672
with a metal detection device.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.540
It is the team's hope

03:26.574 --> 03:28.376
that after the drilling program
is complete,

03:28.409 --> 03:31.412
one or more holes
can be identified

03:31.445 --> 03:33.247
that would serve as targets

03:33.281 --> 03:35.616
for a much more thorough
investigation.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.487
That's moving right on down now.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.921
TERRY:
Yup.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.924
CRAIG:
Okay, sound's good.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.330
NARRATOR: As the Geo-Tech
operation continues...

03:49.363 --> 03:50.731
MARTY: All right, Gary,
today's the day.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.032
Let's find something.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.435
NARRATOR:
Rick and Marty Lagina--

03:54.468 --> 03:57.638
along with Dave Blankenship
and metal detection expert

03:57.671 --> 04:01.309
Gary Drayton-- head to Lot 16.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.445
They are hoping to find--
not necessarily treasure--

04:04.478 --> 04:07.281
but evidence of who might
have been on the island

04:07.315 --> 04:09.917
during the years
before the Money Pit

04:09.950 --> 04:12.553
was first discovered
back in 1795.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.987
GARY:
And this is a good sign,

04:14.021 --> 04:16.490
anywhere that's difficult
to get in,

04:16.524 --> 04:20.294
that's a good place
to go metal detecting.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.862
RICK: Really, Lot 16
is highly relevant

04:21.895 --> 04:24.998
because it's a spoils pile,
really.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.902
Right through the Dunfield era,
it was a place where spoils

04:28.936 --> 04:32.406
from the Money Pit workings
were deposited.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.409
GARY: I'd really like to go over
this because this is basically

04:35.443 --> 04:38.078
-one big spoil pile, isn't it?
-Yup.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.514
NARRATOR:
When treasure hunter,

04:40.548 --> 04:44.618
Robert Dunfield, attempted
to find the Money Pit in 1965,

04:44.652 --> 04:48.389
he did so by digging
a massive 100-foot wide

04:48.422 --> 04:51.959
by 140-foot deep hole.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.528
But when the hole collapsed
due to flooding--

04:54.562 --> 04:57.531
the disappointed
treasure hunter left behind

04:57.565 --> 04:59.099
a massive spoils pile--

04:59.132 --> 05:03.003
one that he never
had the time to examine.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.873
Now, some 50 years later,

05:05.906 --> 05:09.543
Dunfield's spoils
have aged to look like

05:09.577 --> 05:13.381
little more than hills
surrounding the Money Pit site.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.384
Hills that
Rick and Marty Lagina hope

05:16.417 --> 05:19.520
could contain
valuable information

05:19.553 --> 05:21.689
that will help them
in their quest.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.726
MARTY:
Where are you headed anyway?

05:25.759 --> 05:27.695
GARY: Just here--
there's a clearing just here,

05:27.728 --> 05:30.498
it's a good place to start.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.833
MARTY: David, you're gonna
bring us good luck.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.635
We've been metal detecting
without you.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.036
-This time we got you.
-Exactly.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.640
-Yeah. -Find something, Gary,
shiny and gold.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.041
MARTY:
Good, let's see if it works.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.716
RICK: Whenever you're in close
proximity to the Money Pit,

05:48.749 --> 05:51.919
you have no idea the possibility
of what you might find.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.622
GARY: Come on, baby,
sing to me. (chuckles)

05:54.655 --> 05:56.690
RICK: So, I think we're all
very excited to see

05:56.724 --> 05:58.058
what might come of today.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.093
(detector beeping)

06:00.127 --> 06:02.430
A target, guys,

06:02.463 --> 06:06.166
should be directly under
the center of the search coil

06:06.199 --> 06:08.135
and it's reading six inches.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.476
MARTY:
It's out.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.110
DAVE:
Yeah, it sounds like it.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.814
MARTY:
Reveal your secrets.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.116
GARY:
I think this is probably...

06:25.453 --> 06:28.522
...a bloody modern nail.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.157
A broken one as well.
That's even worse.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.092
That means there's
another piece here.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.195
Well, quit finding that (bleep),
Gary, and find something good.

06:35.228 --> 06:39.633
I say we move away
from this dastardly area.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.135
DAVE: Come on, Gary, we ain't
going to be here all day now.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.104
-You haven't found anything yet?
-That's right.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.806
-GARY: Not yet.
-RICK: Come on now.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.542
It takes longer than that.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.078
Let's just cover
this little area.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.481
(detector beeping)

06:53.514 --> 06:57.117
I think I'm picking up
your shovel, Rick.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.987
No, I'm not.
I've got a target.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.689
(detector whining)

07:03.190 --> 07:05.593
Well, mate, just there.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.767
-GARY: Rick takes no prisoners.
-You've got a root there, Rick.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.542
-(detector beeping)
-Well, whatever it is, it's out.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.911
Pinpointer time.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.179
DAVE: Right down here,
something shining.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.820
GARY:
Ooh...

07:32.853 --> 07:34.922
I see round.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.757
Wow, look at that.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.726
Is it a button... or a coin?

07:38.759 --> 07:41.194
Hey, how about that?

07:41.228 --> 07:44.031
Wow, David, you are lucky.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.067
GARY:
I got another target, hang on.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.669
Certainly,
roundness in the hole.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.070
Ooh! Another one.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.606
Is that a button or a coin?

07:52.640 --> 07:56.710
-DAVE: Wow.
-It's a coin.

07:56.744 --> 08:00.213
Ah! I'm seeing
"Britannia" on it.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.216
It's definitely some kind of
English coin.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.286
I see a "16."
I see a "one" and a "six."

08:06.319 --> 08:08.255
DAVE: Looks like it's got
a head on it.

08:08.288 --> 08:12.125
GARY: Yeah, look who I see,
that's Charles II.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.761
-Come on!
-Yeah, that's Charles.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.629
This isn't George.

08:15.663 --> 08:20.167
Look, that's the back
of his head; there's his face.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.571
And I can see a "Carolus."

08:23.604 --> 08:25.773
-Wow.
-Definitely.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.542
(all laughing)

08:28.576 --> 08:30.844
Fantastic.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.880
NARRATOR:
In 1660--

08:32.913 --> 08:34.982
following an era of
strict Puritanism

08:35.015 --> 08:37.651
under Oliver Cromwell--

08:37.685 --> 08:41.321
the British monarchy was
restored under King Charles II.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.190
To celebrate,

08:43.223 --> 08:45.225
coins of all denominations
were minted

08:45.258 --> 08:47.628
in the likeness of the king,

08:47.661 --> 08:50.864
along with the words "Carolus,"
Latin for Charles,

08:50.898 --> 08:55.669
until his death in 1685.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.572
We definitely haven't found
any of these, I mean...

08:58.606 --> 09:01.008
DAVE: Well, Marty,
maybe I am good luck.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.911
-You're goddang right
you're good luck. -(laughs)

09:03.944 --> 09:06.980
RICK:
I see 1600-something...

09:07.014 --> 09:12.185
-MARTY: Looks like 1673.
-GARY: Holy shamoly.

09:12.219 --> 09:20.360
DAVE:
Way to go, Gary!

09:20.393 --> 09:22.863
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

09:22.896 --> 09:24.765
I can't believe it, honestly,
that's pretty cool.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.834
NARRATOR: While searching
the Dunfield spoils

09:26.867 --> 09:31.338
on Lot 16, Rick, Marty,
Dave and Gary

09:31.371 --> 09:35.142
have just made a pair
of significant discoveries.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.877
There's a date on this one, too.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.246
Right down at the bottom. 1694!

09:39.279 --> 09:41.749
Keep looking, Gary,
find us a third one.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.183
Look at David,
he's pretty excited.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.785
DAVE: Right, baby!
It means something!

09:44.818 --> 09:46.219
And these aren't even
spendables here.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.655
That's right,
it means something!

09:47.688 --> 09:51.058
GARY:
That is fantastic.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.126
MARTY:
That's a real big deal to me,

09:53.160 --> 09:55.228
the 1600 coins.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.197
Historically, this would not
have been a significant island

09:57.230 --> 09:59.032
in the late 1600s.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.835
It would have been just
a nondescript nothing.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.972
-Charles II, yeah?
-Yup, Charles II.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.207
That's way too early
for people to be here.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.244
That's 120 years before the find
of the Money Pit, for sure.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.413
GARY:
Yup.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.350
NARRATOR: Could finding these
17th century coins offer proof

10:17.384 --> 10:19.252
that the stories of pirates
frequenting the island

10:19.286 --> 10:21.789
are true?

10:21.822 --> 10:24.725
If so, could they
hold the key to solving

10:24.758 --> 10:28.662
the 222-year-old
Oak Island mystery?

10:28.696 --> 10:31.298
Whoa, I believe this is a coin.

10:31.331 --> 10:34.234
NARRATOR: And, could they also
have a connection

10:34.267 --> 10:37.370
to the 17th century
Spanish maravedi

10:37.404 --> 10:39.973
found in the swamp
nearly four years ago?

10:42.242 --> 10:45.145
MARTY:
So, the Spanish coin was 1650.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.947
-This is very contemporaneous,
I mean close. -Mm-hmm.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.950
So, you got the Spanish and
the English on this island?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.284
I didn't think
they liked each other.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.420
MARTY:
Not at all.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.223
You know, late 1600s,

10:56.256 --> 10:58.826
that's the time of Captain Kidd.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.327
NARRATOR:
Captain Kidd--

11:00.360 --> 11:04.164
the infamous 17th century
privateer?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.800
The notion that
Captain William Kidd

11:06.834 --> 11:08.869
frequented Oak Island--

11:08.902 --> 11:12.339
and possibly buried treasure
there-- is not a new one.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.809
In his book, Captain Kidd
and his Skeleton Island,

11:15.843 --> 11:18.779
first published in 1935,

11:18.812 --> 11:22.850
author Harold Wilkins
included what he claimed

11:22.883 --> 11:25.786
was a faithful reproduction
of an authentic treasure map--

11:25.819 --> 11:28.956
a map that depicted
a destination

11:28.989 --> 11:32.359
with a striking similarity
to Oak Island.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.295
Although Wilkins claimed
his book was fictionalized,

11:35.328 --> 11:38.165
Oak Island treasure hunter
Gilbert Hedden

11:38.198 --> 11:40.000
was not convinced--

11:40.033 --> 11:42.169
and spent years trying
to find treasure

11:42.202 --> 11:45.072
using the map as his guide.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.307
Let me re-check the hole.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.310
NARRATOR: But could finding
a number of 17th century coins

11:50.343 --> 11:52.112
from different countries...

11:52.145 --> 11:54.147
rekindle the notion that
the men behind

11:54.181 --> 11:58.085
the Oak Island mystery really
were pirates all along,

11:58.118 --> 12:01.454
as Dan Blankenship
has long suspected?

12:01.488 --> 12:03.256
So, we will come back,

12:03.290 --> 12:05.258
ut let's go show Dan
those two coins. -Yeah.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.161
Those are probably
the most significant thing

12:08.195 --> 12:11.064
-in a couple of years.
-See what your dad says.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.133
Okay.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.903
NARRATOR: After their
breakthrough discovery

12:15.936 --> 12:18.138
on Lot 16...

12:18.171 --> 12:20.340
Rick and Marty Lagina--

12:20.373 --> 12:23.476
along with Gary Drayton
and Dave Blankenship--

12:23.510 --> 12:26.179
head to the home of veteran
Oak Island treasure hunter,

12:26.213 --> 12:28.381
Dan Blankenship.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.384
Hello! Daniel!

12:31.418 --> 12:32.786
Oh, Marty!

12:32.820 --> 12:34.354
MARTY:
How are you doing, man?

12:34.387 --> 12:36.489
Stay down, you're all set.
We'll come over there.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.892
-Partner.
-How you doing?

12:38.926 --> 12:41.094
I'm okay, Daniel, how you doing?

12:41.128 --> 12:43.330
It's important to show
the coins to Dan for,

12:43.363 --> 12:47.835
I'd say, two reasons.
One is 'cause he's our partner.

12:47.868 --> 12:51.038
But more significantly,
Rick, to a huge extent,

12:51.071 --> 12:54.274
wants to be the guy who places
something in Dan's hands

12:54.307 --> 12:57.911
that validates his life's work.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.147
So, Dan, we were out
metal detecting today,

13:00.180 --> 13:03.984
up by the eastern side
of the swamp.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.486
I'll let David say
how exciting it was.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.421
Show 'em, show 'em
what it was, Gary.

13:08.455 --> 13:12.492
-And even Dave was excited,
jumping up and down. -Yeah.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.328
GARY:
It's two coins.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.370
MARTY:
This is English, 1673.

13:23.403 --> 13:28.075
-DAN: That's very interesting.
-That's King Charles II.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.277
We're sure of it.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.114
DAN: That confirms that
the English were here

13:34.147 --> 13:35.916
in the neighborhood of 1670.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.551
-Yes.
-Oh, yeah.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.588
When I first got involved here
in '65,

13:41.621 --> 13:45.292
the main thing I wanted to,
to establish was authenticity,

13:45.325 --> 13:47.895
-you know. That's what I was
looking for. -Oh, yeah.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.597
-This is part of that.
-Yeah.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.400
It gives credence
to the history of it.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.169
-Yes, to the Money Pit.
-Right.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.605
There's no question about that.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.307
Hopefully, this is just
the beginning of these coins.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.942
MARTY:
The beginning!

14:01.975 --> 14:05.012
-Good luck. -Good luck.
Perfect. Dan, thank you.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.320
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

14:13.353 --> 14:15.022
KYLE FETTERLY:
How deep is your casing?

14:15.055 --> 14:17.657
IVAN GOUGH:
115, 117. Something like that.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.127
NARRATOR: ...the team returns
to the Money Pit site

14:20.160 --> 14:22.462
to check in
on the day's progress.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.264
-So, what are we looking for?
-The vault!

14:24.297 --> 14:25.999
We're looking for the vault.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.901
CRAIG:
That'd be the main thing.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.903
RICK: The reason why we
picked this hole is it's,

14:29.937 --> 14:31.972
it's an odd location,
if you will.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.207
It's actually a hole in between
the Hedden and Chappell shafts,

14:34.241 --> 14:36.309
right in close proximity

14:36.343 --> 14:40.247
to where William put his
drilling platform in 1897.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.082
Where they encountered

14:42.115 --> 14:43.616
the, the... the vault.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.121
NARRATOR:
In 1897--

14:48.155 --> 14:51.992
after drilling to a depth
of approximately 153 feet--

14:52.025 --> 14:53.526
treasure hunters
William Chappell

14:53.560 --> 14:56.629
and Frederick Blair discovered

14:56.663 --> 14:59.299
what they believed was
a seven-foot-tall wooden vault

14:59.332 --> 15:03.036
encased in a substance
similar to concrete.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.505
When they extracted
their drill bit,

15:05.538 --> 15:09.242
they were astonished
to find traces of gold...

15:09.276 --> 15:12.579
and a tiny piece of paper on
which were written the letters,

15:12.612 --> 15:14.514
"V-I."

15:14.547 --> 15:16.950
They kept drilling.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.219
And at a depth of 171 feet,

15:19.252 --> 15:21.221
they encountered
what appeared to be

15:21.254 --> 15:23.590
an impenetrable metal plate.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.327
A plate which, they suspected,
could have been put there

15:27.360 --> 15:30.497
to protect something
of incredible value.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.103
-DAVE: How deep are they now?
-RICK: 155.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.138
-You hit bedrock yet?
-No.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.450
-It is hard?
-KYLE: Yeah, it's a lot harder

15:50.483 --> 15:52.252
than what we drilled through
so far on this hole.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.586
CRAIG:
What depth are we at?

15:53.620 --> 15:59.159
-KYLE: Somewhere in
the 160 to 165 range. -Okay.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.266
KYLE: Taking a little while
to chew through it.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.701
-Okay. -JACK: Part of me
is anxiously waiting

16:08.735 --> 16:13.173
-to see it just start spilling
gold coins out. -Yeah, me, too.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.608
CRAIG: He said this wood's
drilling a lot harder

16:15.642 --> 16:17.577
than any of the wood
they drilled before.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.213
So, I'm not sure
what that means...

16:24.417 --> 16:26.119
He's found something.

16:29.589 --> 16:33.293
-Wow.
-Maybe it wasn't hardwood.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.527
Maybe it was steel.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.469
Chunk of metal.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.275
RICK:
Pretty bright and shiny.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.613
DAVE:
Where'd that come from?

16:53.646 --> 16:56.616
At what depth are we,
right here? To get that?

16:56.649 --> 16:59.419
TERRY:
That was at 162.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.355
NARRATOR: Metal? Has the team
hit the same obstruction

17:02.389 --> 17:06.826
that Chappell and Blair
first encountered in 1897?

17:06.859 --> 17:09.396
Well, he said right now, too,
he's having a real hard time

17:09.429 --> 17:10.830
going through whatever
they're at, right now.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.799
Well, if he's going
through metal, no wonder.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.667
MARTY: You get that little
frisson of excitement,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.070
the flash in the pan.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.638
So, great, you know, maybe we're
getting into something,

17:18.671 --> 17:20.473
you know? And we're gonna
drill through a metal plate,

17:20.507 --> 17:22.675
we're getting into the vault,
you know? Your hopes rise.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.412
DAVE: Got a bigger piece
there now, Rick.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.814
KYLE:
It's not a hardened steel,

17:27.847 --> 17:29.649
but it's not soft either.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.050
Okay.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.822
-Getting bigger pieces.
-(laughter)

17:35.855 --> 17:38.491
MARTY:
Wait, what do you think that is?

17:41.461 --> 17:44.231
-And do you think it looks
modern? -I don't think so.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.434
MARTY: It just kind of blows me
away, these bits of metal.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.801
I don't know
what to make of that.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.203
We'll get it tested.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.439
NARRATOR: The Geo-Tech operation
has been forced to stop.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.708
Whatever object
the drill has encountered,

18:28.741 --> 18:31.144
it cannot be penetrated

18:31.178 --> 18:34.347
without doing further damage
to the drill bit.

18:34.381 --> 18:39.319
Okay, so we'll have to abandon
the hole or come up,

18:39.352 --> 18:41.788
put a new shoe on,
and go down through.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.162
Yeah, I get it. Decision?

18:49.196 --> 18:52.665
I'd say we run the PVC pipe
right here as deep as we can.

18:52.699 --> 18:56.203
-We're going to drill closer
to this area again anyway. -Yes.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.438
I'm all for that.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.639
I'm not dismayed at all.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.509
That's the reason
for the grid, you know?

19:02.542 --> 19:03.876
We may find it
in the first hole;

19:03.910 --> 19:06.279
we may find it
in the 37th hole.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.781
We'll find it.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.184
We're done here, Kyle.
We're all set.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.885
-Run the plastic.
-Sounds good. All right.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.388
Thanks, guys.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.797
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

19:24.831 --> 19:27.400
-sounds, sounds kind of serious.
-Yeah, it does.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.436
NARRATOR:
The next morning,

19:29.469 --> 19:31.704
while the Oak Island team
waits for a new drill bit

19:31.738 --> 19:33.573
to arrive...

19:33.606 --> 19:36.243
Marty Lagina and his friend
and partner, Craig Tester,

19:36.276 --> 19:38.445
head to the home
of Dave Blankenship,

19:38.478 --> 19:42.682
for what promises to be
an important meeting.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.285
Rick got a letter
from Heritage and Culture

19:45.318 --> 19:49.789
that he wants to talk about.
It doesn't sound good.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.391
When did this arrive?

19:51.424 --> 19:52.825
Last day or something, I guess.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.763
MARTY:
I get a text from Rick

19:56.796 --> 19:59.866
that there's something needs
serious attention right away.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.936
This is ominous, okay?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.972
I mean, Rick doesn't usually
react that way.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.007
Hello?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.743
Something's up,
something not good.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.248
All right,
what's this all about?

20:15.282 --> 20:16.816
You ain't gonna like it,
'cause I don't like it.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.651
-Really?
-Yup.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.523
MARTY: Well, okay,
I see what you mean.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.293
This isn't sounding good.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.364
"Metal detecting of the island
has the potential

20:31.398 --> 20:33.500
"to impact existing
archeological sites

20:33.533 --> 20:34.967
"and resources.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.936
"And as such, would need to be
part of a larger

20:36.969 --> 20:39.539
"archeological survey
methodology.

20:39.572 --> 20:44.043
"Metal detecting and noting
any hits with GPS photos, etc.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.513
"And sharing that information
with CCH..."

20:46.546 --> 20:48.581
That's Culture and Heritage,
I assume?

20:48.615 --> 20:50.317
-Community Culture and Heritage.
-"...is acceptable

20:50.350 --> 20:52.552
"as long as we are very clear
this does not include

20:52.585 --> 20:54.387
excavation or removal
of objects."

20:58.024 --> 21:00.893
"You would definitely need
to carry out this work

21:00.927 --> 21:02.595
under a Heritage
Research Permit."

21:04.497 --> 21:06.499
We'd have to file a permit
on every one of them.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.401
That's what this says.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.969
Well, if that sets a precedent,

21:10.002 --> 21:12.339
then it means that
everywhere on the island,

21:12.372 --> 21:14.907
that will be a requirement.
That's my concern.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.078
MARTY:
I think... this is really...

21:19.111 --> 21:21.381
This really is upsetting.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.550
-Mm-hmm.
-MARTY: It's unworkable.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.552
I mean, you'd think
this was a joke.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.853
-DAVE: Yeah.
-Totally agree.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.287
MARTY:
This is really bad.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.659
This is the first step
in shutting down

21:32.692 --> 21:35.962
-the whole island.
-The whole island.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.465
NARRATOR: After acquiring
a partnership stake

21:38.498 --> 21:41.601
in Oak Island Tours in 2006,

21:41.634 --> 21:44.671
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with their partners,

21:44.704 --> 21:46.806
petitioned
the Canadian government

21:46.839 --> 21:50.777
to grant them the right to look
for treasure on Oak Island.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.646
Passed in 2010,

21:53.680 --> 21:56.949
the Oak Island Treasure Act
allows the team's corporation,

21:56.983 --> 21:59.486
Oak Island Tours,
to actively search

21:59.519 --> 22:01.053
on all areas of the island

22:01.087 --> 22:03.790
not considered
cultural landmarks.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.759
Chiefly,
the Samuel Ball Foundation,

22:06.793 --> 22:09.629
and the McGinnis Foundation.

22:09.662 --> 22:13.866
Also heavily regulated are
the waters around the island,

22:13.900 --> 22:17.437
as well as
the Oak Island swamp.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.039
The metal detection
has provided lots of clues

22:20.072 --> 22:22.542
to what might
have happened here.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.377
And it's continuing to.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.979
So, we're very upset.
Very upset about this.

22:27.013 --> 22:31.784
The clue that we need could be
out there to be metal-detected,

22:31.818 --> 22:36.022
and we'll never find it
under this protocol.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.857
It's not just the concern
they've expressed.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.792
They've given us parameters

22:39.826 --> 22:42.762
under which we can no longer
proceed, in our opinion.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.698
So, it's very chilling to the
exploration efforts out here.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.134
We just don't get it.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.570
All the Canadian government
agencies we've worked with

22:50.603 --> 22:52.004
have been great.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.541
-Mm-hmm. -And we have been
very respectful,

22:54.574 --> 22:55.975
and you, you know,
I've praised you before.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.578
We've been 100% compliant.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.482
We've crossed every "T,"
dotted every "I,"

23:02.515 --> 23:04.517
obeyed every rule
and regulation,

23:04.551 --> 23:09.021
and to have restrictions
on what we can and cannot do,

23:09.055 --> 23:10.890
I find it to be
counterproductive,

23:10.923 --> 23:13.192
-at the very least.
-Yeah.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.061
So Rick,
what is this all about?

23:15.094 --> 23:17.029
Because it doesn't
make any sense.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.432
RICK:
Here's the backstory.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.601
-We all know we had to turn
over the artifacts. -Yeah.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.570
-We did. -We found a lot of...
And we did.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.606
We found a lot of artifacts
last year on Lot 24.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.576
One of the Samuel Ball lots.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.945
-Holy smokes.
-Look at these.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.181
Wow.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.450
NARRATOR: Last year,
while searching near the site

23:37.484 --> 23:40.753
of what was once the home
of former 18th century

23:40.787 --> 23:44.190
American slave turned
British loyalist, Samuel Ball,

23:44.223 --> 23:47.126
the Oak Island team
unearthed a number

23:47.159 --> 23:49.829
of 18th century British coins,

23:49.862 --> 23:54.634
and a brass tag on which
was engraved the name: Ball.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.969
But could finding
this simple artifact

23:57.003 --> 23:59.706
have ignited
such intense concern

23:59.739 --> 24:02.208
on the part
of the Canadian authorities

24:02.241 --> 24:05.077
that the entire
search operation on Oak Island

24:05.111 --> 24:08.815
could be all but shut down?

24:08.848 --> 24:11.684
I know when the treasure
trove license was passed,

24:11.718 --> 24:13.920
the archaeological community

24:13.953 --> 24:16.589
didn't want Oak Island
having an act.

24:16.623 --> 24:20.226
Maybe they're getting a lot
of heat from that community.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.729
If they're really worried
about archaeology,

24:22.762 --> 24:25.698
we're doing archaeology
for free for them.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.900
It doesn't make any sense.
We're turning everything over.

24:27.934 --> 24:31.170
I mean, papers have been written
by the archaeological community;

24:31.203 --> 24:36.108
Oak Island is just a junkyard
of 220 some years of search.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.945
MARTY: I never thought
that this treasure hunt

24:38.978 --> 24:41.013
would lead
to archaeological interest,

24:41.047 --> 24:42.915
for the simple reason

24:42.949 --> 24:48.821
that it's been so destroyed
by 220 years of search.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.190
But the way it's evolved,
I never pictured.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.292
Stuff could be
near the surface

24:53.325 --> 24:55.762
that is archaeologically
significant,

24:55.795 --> 24:57.897
but how are we gonna find it
under this protocol?

24:57.930 --> 24:59.666
DAVE: And if we don't find it,
they don't get it.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.034
MARTY: This is so serious to us
and so devastating

25:02.068 --> 25:04.637
to our efforts
that we have to...

25:04.671 --> 25:06.238
you know, we need to have
a face-to-face meeting.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.249
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

25:17.283 --> 25:18.785
CRAIG:
We didn't do anything wrong.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.887
NARRATOR:
One day after being informed

25:20.920 --> 25:22.855
that their treasure
hunting operations

25:22.889 --> 25:24.290
would have to shut down,

25:24.323 --> 25:27.326
Craig Tester and members
of the Oak Island team

25:27.359 --> 25:29.228
gather at a nearby pub.

25:29.261 --> 25:30.897
DAVE:
They're government,

25:30.930 --> 25:32.699
and they can change
their frickin' mind.

25:32.732 --> 25:36.235
If we add on an extra
step for every single dig,

25:36.268 --> 25:39.338
-that slows us down
even further. -Yup. Exactly.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.008
NARRATOR: They are anxiously
awaiting news

25:42.041 --> 25:43.943
of Rick and Marty Lagina's

25:43.976 --> 25:46.045
scheduled meeting
with representatives

25:46.078 --> 25:48.715
from Nova Scotia's
Department of Community,

25:48.748 --> 25:50.883
Culture and Heritage.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.819
CRAIG:
They can stop roads,

25:52.852 --> 25:55.154
they can stop buildings,
they can stop anything.

25:55.187 --> 25:56.789
JACK:
They can do what they want.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.691
-Government never backs down.
-Yeah.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.794
Hey, guys.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.262
-Hey.
-Hey, how you doing, Marty?

26:03.295 --> 26:04.731
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.299
We're here.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.368
So, we did meet

26:09.401 --> 26:11.237
with the Ministry
of Culture and Heritage,

26:11.270 --> 26:13.272
and, um...

26:13.305 --> 26:14.807
you know, it started
out a little tense.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.845
-ALEX: Can we dig?
-Not yet.

26:18.878 --> 26:22.048
MARTY:
But where we are is,

26:22.081 --> 26:24.617
we have a letter that would
be severely restrictive,

26:24.651 --> 26:25.952
and we're trying
to make progress

26:25.985 --> 26:27.887
in a mutually agreeable sense.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.357
It's not gonna be totally
logical from our standpoint.

26:31.390 --> 26:34.293
MARTY: The agenda going in
was to find out why.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.096
Well, we found out why,
and it appears, to me,

26:37.129 --> 26:38.865
likely that they're
getting pressure

26:38.898 --> 26:41.233
from the archaeological
community.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.936
I think because of what's
happening here on this island,

26:43.970 --> 26:46.038
more people are
paying attention.

26:46.072 --> 26:49.976
Our proposal is we would hire
an archaeologist.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.945
-More money.
-(chuckles)

26:52.979 --> 26:57.416
That that archaeologist would
get a one-time Heritage permit,

26:57.449 --> 26:59.418
not for every dig.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.954
And then, the idea would be that

27:01.988 --> 27:04.023
what we're gonna
try to get sold

27:04.056 --> 27:06.759
is that you could
metal-detect all you want.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.327
But any time there was a dig,

27:08.360 --> 27:10.162
the archaeologist
would have to be present.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.831
Yeah.

27:11.864 --> 27:12.965
MARTY:
There would be an archaeologist

27:12.999 --> 27:14.934
basically tagging
along with you.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.236
Right. I mean,
I've already contacted Laird.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.971
So we can use the archaeologist
we had before.

27:19.005 --> 27:19.906
-Yes.
-He's acceptable to them?

27:19.939 --> 27:21.440
He is acceptable.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.342
And he's a reasonable guy, so.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.811
-I agree.
-Yep.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.379
NARRATOR:
Archaeologist Laird Niven

27:27.413 --> 27:30.016
has been working with
and advising

27:30.049 --> 27:33.052
the Oak Island team ever
since helping them obtain

27:33.085 --> 27:36.222
their treasure trove
license seven years ago.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.191
It was Laird whom, last year,

27:39.225 --> 27:41.894
was brought in to evaluate
the team's findings

27:41.928 --> 27:45.397
of what appeared to be
a mysterious "hatch"

27:45.431 --> 27:48.034
located on the western end
of the island.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.737
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

27:50.770 --> 27:52.839
-That's exactly what
I was going to ask. -No.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.307
No. That's not natural.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.377
NARRATOR:
Laird was also instrumental

27:58.410 --> 28:00.212
in helping the team evaluate

28:00.246 --> 28:02.882
an elaborate arrangement
of rocks and boulders

28:02.915 --> 28:06.318
found buried beneath
the waters of Smith's Cove.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.487
Laird, I'm gonna put you
on the spot now.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.922
Man-made?

28:09.956 --> 28:11.323
LAIRD:
I believe so, yeah.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.291
-Wow.
-Yeah.

28:14.493 --> 28:17.764
Culture and Heritage,
as part of our process here,

28:17.797 --> 28:20.366
has mandated that
an archaeologist be involved

28:20.399 --> 28:22.134
with any digging,

28:22.168 --> 28:24.804
and we already have
a relationship with Laird.

28:24.837 --> 28:27.139
He brings a lot to the table. So
yes, we like working with him.

28:27.173 --> 28:29.308
It's a compromise.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.177
MARTY: Absolutely. You know,
if you think about it,

28:31.210 --> 28:33.946
they're winners in this and,
I guess, to some extent,

28:33.980 --> 28:35.782
so are we.
Hey, look.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.016
Being as we're the emissaries,

28:37.049 --> 28:38.284
we think we did a hell
of a great job.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.518
Don't we, guys?

28:39.551 --> 28:40.920
(laughter)

28:45.892 --> 28:47.860
NARRATOR:
The next day,

28:47.894 --> 28:50.262
in the wake of their
critically important meeting

28:50.296 --> 28:52.398
with Canadian officials...

28:52.431 --> 28:54.466
-Hey, Laird. -Good morning.
-MARTY: Hello, Laird.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.837
NARRATOR: Rick, Marty
and Craig Tester have invited

28:57.870 --> 28:59.872
area archaeologist
Laird Niven,

28:59.906 --> 29:02.208
to meet with them in person.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.843
MARTY:
So, here's the deal.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.145
We got a letter
from Culture and Heritage

29:06.178 --> 29:08.347
-that says, "Stop.
-RICK: Mm-hmm.

29:08.380 --> 29:11.350
"Stop metal detecting.
Stop digging.

29:11.383 --> 29:15.287
Stop doing..." basically,
what we're doing. I mean,

29:15.321 --> 29:17.023
yeah, we felt like, "Uh, oh,

29:17.056 --> 29:18.557
this is the first
step in shutdown."

29:18.590 --> 29:20.359
So, we had a face-to-face.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.228
Apparently,
what they really wanted

29:22.261 --> 29:24.496
was an additional layer
of supervision.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.833
They need to show

29:26.866 --> 29:30.336
that the correct archaeological
things are being done.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.371
-Right.
-Okay. Enter you.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.006
You know, if you'll take on
this task.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.576
Basically,
be an advisor to us, too.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.478
I guess that's
what I'm trying to say.

29:39.511 --> 29:43.482
And regarding that, as this
story becomes much wider,

29:43.515 --> 29:46.052
we felt that it was appropriate
to tell the story,

29:46.085 --> 29:48.320
as it evolves,
i.e. the things that we find,

29:48.354 --> 29:50.556
the artifacts just
now encompassed

29:50.589 --> 29:52.291
within this building and
we'd like to show it to you.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.193
-Wonderful.
-We're kind of proud of it.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.261
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

29:59.631 --> 30:02.001
Oh. Very nice.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.036
NARRATOR:
Two years ago,

30:04.070 --> 30:06.939
in response to the incredible
public interest

30:06.973 --> 30:10.109
generated by their
treasure-hunting activities,

30:10.142 --> 30:12.578
Rick, Marty, Craig
and their partners

30:12.611 --> 30:14.546
decided to build
a visitor's center

30:14.580 --> 30:17.516
and museum on Oak Island.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.519
Dubbed
The Interpretation Center,

30:20.552 --> 30:22.922
it is a place where thousands

30:22.955 --> 30:26.258
of visitors can come,
gather and examine firsthand

30:26.292 --> 30:28.260
the growing
number of artifacts

30:28.294 --> 30:30.629
and evidence of buried treasure

30:30.662 --> 30:33.599
that the Oak Island team,
and their predecessors,

30:33.632 --> 30:37.503
have discovered
over the past 222 years.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.872
You can make
this story come alive.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.308
-Mm-hmm. -I mean, that's really
what archaeology is.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.910
It's a very high
priority for us.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.144
And, thus, we need your help.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.345
'Cause it's our hope

30:46.378 --> 30:47.613
that the story of Oak Island,

30:47.646 --> 30:49.916
really should come back
to Oak Island,

30:49.949 --> 30:51.918
to be told here, on site.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.852
MARTY: Okay, so,
do you want to do this?

30:56.422 --> 30:59.591
Yeah, I've always been
impressed at how seriously

30:59.625 --> 31:02.094
you take the stewardship
of the island,

31:02.128 --> 31:05.064
no matter what delays it causes,
what pains there are.

31:05.097 --> 31:08.034
So, that's one of the reasons
I'd really like to work here.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.402
-I'll apply for the permits.
-Yep.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.371
Get that done. I think
they'll expedite it quickly.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.639
-Then we can get started.
-Okay.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.541
Great, Laird.
Now, we're hoping

31:15.574 --> 31:19.245
the things we find next
will make this look boring.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.647
-Right?
-(laughter)

31:21.680 --> 31:23.549
Looks pretty good already.

31:23.582 --> 31:30.689
MARTY:
Good to have you aboard.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.058
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

31:32.091 --> 31:33.592
GARY:
Oh, yeah.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.161
NARRATOR:
One day after inviting

31:35.194 --> 31:37.229
area archaeologist Laird Niven

31:37.263 --> 31:39.932
to join the Oak Island team...

31:39.966 --> 31:42.368
So, this is the hot spot
over here, huh, Gary?

31:42.401 --> 31:44.636
Uh, further down the hill, yeah.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.673
NARRATOR: Brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina

31:47.706 --> 31:50.409
along with metal detection
expert, Gary Drayton,

31:50.442 --> 31:53.946
head to Lot 24...

31:53.980 --> 31:56.582
-Wow!
-...where, last year,

31:56.615 --> 31:58.250
the team found a number

31:58.284 --> 32:00.119
of potentially significant
artifacts

32:00.152 --> 32:04.223
related to Samuel Ball.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.659
I think this is the sweet spot,
this area here,

32:07.693 --> 32:09.428
because there's
been so many coins

32:09.461 --> 32:12.398
and some other interesting
stuff coming out of here.

32:12.431 --> 32:16.002
-Right. -I figure if you guys
could move these tree trunks,

32:16.035 --> 32:17.970
what would you use,
like, a backhoe?

32:18.004 --> 32:19.705
-Not using this.
-(laughter)

32:19.738 --> 32:22.308
GARY: No, no, definitely not.
When those stumps come out,

32:22.341 --> 32:25.044
we're gonna be able
to detect places

32:25.077 --> 32:27.479
that's never been detected,
underneath the stumps.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.416
-Exactly.
-And hopefully,

32:30.449 --> 32:33.619
there will be some more stuff
that helps identify...

32:33.652 --> 32:35.554
-RICK: Right.
-...the site.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.656
All right, well,
let's do it, then.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.158
-Up with the roots. Okay.
-GARY: Yeah.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.226
MARTY: I'm gonna
go get the machine.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.694
All right.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.330
(beeping steadily)

32:56.308 --> 32:58.444
Gary, here's your first chance
to get beneath the tree,

32:58.477 --> 32:59.611
right over here.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.780
All right, sweet.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.583
RICK:
The 3030 metal detector,

33:04.616 --> 33:07.019
it's an extension of
Gary's arm and his brain.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.187
That's how good he is.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.388
(beeping)

33:09.421 --> 33:10.722
GARY:
That's a really good sound.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.092
We might take a spade-full
out of here.

33:13.125 --> 33:17.129
RICK: It was very impactful that
we must search exhaustively,

33:17.163 --> 33:19.531
and we mustn't give up.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.735
I should be able
to reach it now.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.638
Well...

33:29.375 --> 33:31.810
Come on, baby.
Be something good.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.579
(rapid beeping)

33:36.515 --> 33:37.683
(rapid beeping)

33:41.853 --> 33:43.722
Ooh!

33:43.755 --> 33:45.291
Look at this!

33:45.324 --> 33:47.193
-That's sweet.
-RICK: What is that?

33:47.226 --> 33:50.629
I would imagine
it's a spoon bowl.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.664
-And that's exactly what it is.
-LAIRD: That's a little one.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.500
-MARTY: Oh, look at that cute
little thing. -GARY: Ooh.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.702
That's a little beauty,
look at that.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.737
-That's an oldie as well,
isn't it, Laird? -LAIRD: Yeah.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.740
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.
-How old, Laird? Do you think?

34:01.773 --> 34:05.077
-18th century. -RICK: Yeah.
-18th century?

34:05.111 --> 34:08.347
-Yeah. -That's a little beauty
that is, isn't it?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.682
-It's probably copper.
-MARTY: That is really cool.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.119
GARY:
That is a sweet find.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.786
-The first tree?
-MARTY: Yeah.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.322
All right, well,
let's keep going.

34:39.145 --> 34:42.314
First thing I'll do
is check this.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.625
-(beeps)
-It's a chirpy piece of iron.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.294
Come on, something big here.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.632
-(beeping)
-All right.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.534
-Actually...
-RICK: That's a good one.

35:02.568 --> 35:03.835
GARY:
That's a good one.

35:05.371 --> 35:06.672
There's definitely
something here.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.141
It's just so tough
to tell what it is.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.442
(beeps)

35:12.478 --> 35:14.513
Come on, be something good.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.348
(rapid beeping)

35:16.382 --> 35:18.550
See, I got a feeling
that's actually something.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.186
I don't know why.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.254
(rapid beeping)

35:22.288 --> 35:24.756
GARY:
What the heck is that?

35:24.790 --> 35:27.159
MARTY:
What do you got?

35:27.193 --> 35:28.927
I'd like to say it was gold.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.329
MARTY:
Oh, my.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.169
GARY: Well, that was worth
all the digging.

35:37.203 --> 35:39.638
That's a big chunk of something.

35:39.671 --> 35:40.939
MARTY:
Is that a rock?

35:40.972 --> 35:44.210
No, it's iron.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.312
RICK:
Every piece that Gary finds

35:46.345 --> 35:47.913
are all important clues.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.182
We're trying to puzzle together
this story,

35:50.216 --> 35:51.583
and we're hopeful

35:51.617 --> 35:53.185
that some of these artifacts

35:53.219 --> 35:55.721
will give us
a lot of information

35:55.754 --> 35:58.590
as to its relevance
to Oak Island, the mystery.

35:58.624 --> 35:59.825
MARTY:
What is that?

36:01.227 --> 36:02.728
So, it's an iron strapping.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.497
It could be, like, a door hinge.

36:05.531 --> 36:08.300
MARTY: I told you
it was something in there.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.302
It's kind of indicating
that there was a house here,

36:10.336 --> 36:11.970
-wasn't there?
-Yeah.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.772
I think that might be it.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.607
MARTY: Well, we might as well
pull a few more of these, then.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.309
GARY:
Yep.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.225
That's it.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.894
GARY:
What the heck is that?

36:35.927 --> 36:37.529
I think we have to stop.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.207
I think we have to stop.

36:51.777 --> 36:55.581
NARRATOR: While searching
for artifacts on Lot 24,

36:55.614 --> 36:57.416
Rick and Marty Lagina,

36:57.449 --> 37:00.786
along with metal detection
expert Gary Drayton

37:00.819 --> 37:03.322
and archaeologist Laird Niven,
have just made

37:03.355 --> 37:05.791
a potentially significant find.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.294
You can see the obvious
concern we have.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.462
-What's that?
-See the rocks?

37:10.496 --> 37:13.432
You think that's
foundation or something?

37:13.465 --> 37:15.634
I don't know.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.736
I don't know...

37:17.769 --> 37:20.606
MARTY: Laird took one look
at the bottom of that stump,

37:20.639 --> 37:24.042
and he said,
"That's it, we're done. Stop."

37:24.075 --> 37:25.711
He was quite sure he
was seeing something

37:25.744 --> 37:27.713
he calls "cultural,"

37:27.746 --> 37:31.483
some sort of evidence of human
something going on there.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.619
So we were done.
We were done just like that.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.587
NARRATOR: If the formation
they have discovered

37:35.621 --> 37:37.689
is, in fact, man-made,

37:37.723 --> 37:40.792
it is one that has,
up until now,

37:40.826 --> 37:43.429
escaped decades of searches

37:43.462 --> 37:45.864
by previous treasure hunters
and historians.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.599
But what could it be?

37:47.633 --> 37:51.002
A hiding place,
for one of four treasure chests

37:51.036 --> 37:53.839
believed to be hidden
on the island

37:53.872 --> 37:55.541
by the noted pirate
and privateer

37:55.574 --> 37:57.776
Captain James Anderson?

37:57.809 --> 38:00.346
Or could it be a gateway?

38:00.379 --> 38:01.947
One that leads
to the Money Pit's

38:01.980 --> 38:04.616
mythical treasure vault?

38:04.650 --> 38:07.453
You think those are
stacked stones, Laird?

38:07.486 --> 38:09.688
-LAIRD: Um, I don't know yet.
-MARTY: Oh, okay.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.457
LAIRD: The rocks,
there are a lot of rocks,

38:11.490 --> 38:12.858
and they're larger rocks,

38:12.891 --> 38:14.393
which we haven't really
encountered before.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.927
They're roundish, too,
aren't they?

38:15.961 --> 38:17.629
-Yep. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.098
It could be a wall,
it could be a foundation.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.368
-If you strongly suspect
this is an artifact... -I do.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.769
-Yeah, I do. Yeah.
-Wow.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.337
GARY: So, we would never
have known that,

38:25.371 --> 38:27.005
so it's a good job Laird's here.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.040
MARTY: Yeah, get in there
and metal-detect something.

38:29.074 --> 38:30.942
-Okay.
-(chuckles) But don't dig.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.411
I won't dig.

38:34.012 --> 38:36.348
(beeps)

38:39.418 --> 38:42.354
I see where there's all rocks
packed in here, as well,

38:42.388 --> 38:43.622
-inside the roots.
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.025
It almost looked
like bricks in there.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.628
I'm gonna have a little
proggle around here.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.664
That's the last one,
right on top.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.433
(rapid beeping)

38:54.466 --> 38:56.468
Ooh, got a signal in the roots.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.637
-I can pull this out,
can't I, Laird? -LAIRD: Yeah.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.905
(rapid beeping)

38:59.938 --> 39:01.607
GARY:
I have no idea what it is.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.381
Hmm.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.916
Interesting.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.551
I know what that is,

39:12.584 --> 39:14.920
and I love saying it as well.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.054
RICK:
What is it?

39:16.087 --> 39:17.723
It's not gold,

39:17.756 --> 39:19.791
-it's pewter.
-Is it?

39:19.825 --> 39:22.127
GARY: Yeah, I think
this is pewter, Laird.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.696
-Piece of pewter.
-(laughs)

39:24.730 --> 39:28.400
It's got a curve
on it and a rim.

39:28.434 --> 39:33.138
It looks like it's some kind of,
like, a bowl, to me, or a...

39:33.171 --> 39:34.773
No, it's a spoon.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.742
-It's a spoon?
-Yeah, you see the...

39:36.775 --> 39:39.110
the tail at the bottom
of the base,

39:39.144 --> 39:40.712
-at the bottom of the bowl.
-Yeah.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.515
-It probably is a part
of a spoon bowl. -Yeah.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.784
GARY:
Ooh, that's a little beauty.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.185
Look at that.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.620
How do you know it's pewter?

39:48.654 --> 39:50.021
Just by the look of it.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.122
LAIRD:
He just likes saying it.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.958
(laughter)

39:52.991 --> 39:54.593
GARY: What would you
say it is, Laird?

39:54.626 --> 39:56.194
Pewter.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.563
"Pewter"?

39:57.596 --> 39:59.030
(both laugh)

39:59.064 --> 40:01.533
RICK:
We are certainly retrieving

40:01.567 --> 40:04.703
substantial artifacts
from that small, localized area.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.606
As we continue
to retrieve these items,

40:07.639 --> 40:10.208
perhaps working with Laird,

40:10.241 --> 40:13.044
we can puzzle piece this
together, what it really means.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.780
Where do we go from here?

40:14.813 --> 40:17.182
I think to err
on the side of safety,

40:17.215 --> 40:20.752
it's all stop, full stop
for here, right now,

40:20.786 --> 40:22.220
because if this is
something significant,

40:22.253 --> 40:24.956
then that increases
the significance up here.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.125
-RICK: Mm-hmm.
-So, we're gonna come in,

40:27.158 --> 40:29.995
just clean up the loose soil,
clean up the loose rocks.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.830
If we get a much greater
understanding

40:31.863 --> 40:33.499
of what happened here,

40:33.532 --> 40:35.934
that's what we're looking for:
answers.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.836
Something definitely happened
at this spot right here.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.905
GARY:
Oh, without a doubt.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.173
MARTY: All right, let's
call it a day, guys.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.811
NARRATOR: It has been
a challenging week

40:45.844 --> 40:48.079
in the history of Oak Island,

40:48.113 --> 40:52.518
one that began with seemingly
insurmountable obstacles,

40:52.551 --> 40:54.986
but now, once again,

40:55.020 --> 40:56.922
seems to be on the verge

40:56.955 --> 41:00.759
of more and more
exciting breakthroughs.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.094
But will the final
answers be found

41:03.128 --> 41:06.865
under hundreds of feet
of dirt and rocks,

41:06.898 --> 41:09.701
or just inches away?

41:09.735 --> 41:12.904
One thing is certain:

41:12.938 --> 41:16.875
Rick, Marty and the Oak Island
team remain determined.

41:16.908 --> 41:20.712
Not only to solve a mystery
and find treasure,

41:20.746 --> 41:24.583
but to uncover
an incredible history,

41:24.616 --> 41:27.252
a history that forever
changes the lives

41:27.285 --> 41:30.522
of those curious enough
to seek it out.

41:30.556 --> 41:33.058
CAPTIONING PROVIDED BY
A+E NETWORKS

41:34.960 --> 41:37.929
Next time,
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.963 --> 41:39.898
This is my brother,
Rick Restall.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.800
RICK: He is coming back
to the island. -Welcome back.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.202
RICK: The Restalls said
there was a spiral staircase.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.674
You mustn't tell anyone
about this. This is top secret.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.276
Could be the spiral tunnel.

41:51.309 --> 41:52.811
MARTY:
We're closing in. We're close.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.112
RICK:
And now, we're at the cusp

41:54.145 --> 41:55.547
of proving this story.

41:55.581 --> 41:57.949
Holy (bleep)!

41:57.983 --> 41:59.685
-Somebody got hurt.
-RICK: You get close,

41:59.718 --> 42:01.186
and then, all of a sudden,
something happens.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.121
Oak Island strikes back.
