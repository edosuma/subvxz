WEBVTT

00:27.250 --> 00:30.458
There's gotta be something in here I can use to fix him.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.916
Huh.

00:32.958 --> 00:35.041
What have we here?

00:39.666 --> 00:41.333
Okay, little guy--well,

00:41.375 --> 00:43.041
I guess you're not that little,

00:43.083 --> 00:45.791
but I think of you as a child, which you aren't, which is good,

00:45.833 --> 00:47.875
because I'm not graded to rebuild an organic,

00:47.916 --> 00:49.791
mostly because I don't like...

00:49.833 --> 00:51.666
...fluids.

00:51.708 --> 00:54.916
Anyway, this is the least I could do to thank you for saving me.

01:02.958 --> 01:06.500
Are you the--the Maker?

01:06.541 --> 01:07.916
No.

01:07.958 --> 01:10.708
That would be the genius that wrote your code.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.708
His name is Kronis,

01:12.750 --> 01:14.791
and that was probably the last bit of engineering he did for himself

01:14.833 --> 01:17.375
before he found me to do everything for him instead.

01:17.416 --> 01:20.750
Anyway, this old data cog I found should get you back online

01:20.791 --> 01:22.833
without needing to access the RK Hive Mind.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.875
And then you can go back to Eternos. Better than new.

01:29.250 --> 01:32.166
As they say on Avion, "Et voilÃ !"

01:35.666 --> 01:40.375
At least I think that's how they say it.

01:40.416 --> 01:44.125
You are the first Eternians to wield the Power of Grayskull

01:44.166 --> 01:46.291
since Grayskull himself.

01:49.541 --> 01:51.458
That was a thousand years ago.

01:58.666 --> 02:01.208
Why hasn't anyone used it since?

02:03.166 --> 02:06.583
Those seated on the throne after Grayskull's passing

02:06.625 --> 02:09.125
lived and died by a royal decree

02:09.166 --> 02:11.791
that none would ever wield the power,

02:11.833 --> 02:13.791
for it was too great.

02:18.416 --> 02:19.750
Hey!

02:27.250 --> 02:29.000
Whoa!

02:29.041 --> 02:30.958
The power is too great!

02:31.000 --> 02:33.958
Krass'tine, I don't think that's what the elders meant.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.833
I'm not Word Ma'am.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.041
I'm Ram...

02:37.875 --> 02:39.791
...Ma'am?

02:51.750 --> 02:53.458
Now what're you gonna do, huh?

02:54.500 --> 02:55.708
This.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.375
Whoa! No fair!

03:14.375 --> 03:16.291
How do you even fit in there?

03:16.333 --> 03:18.666
It's surprisingly roomy.

03:19.541 --> 03:20.666
Meow!

03:22.041 --> 03:23.250
Whoa!

03:26.375 --> 03:28.458
Incoming!

03:28.500 --> 03:30.166
Time out.

03:32.666 --> 03:34.833
Becoming a Master of the Universe

03:34.875 --> 03:37.791
is all about learning who you really are...

03:38.708 --> 03:40.625
...inside and out.

03:40.666 --> 03:44.250
I think inside me just barfed on outside me.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.875
To the archive--quickly!

03:53.791 --> 03:55.291
Duncan, what's happening?

03:55.333 --> 03:58.416
No... sudden... movements.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.500
This can't be right.

04:03.541 --> 04:07.125
I was there, and now I'm here...

04:07.166 --> 04:09.291
which is very much not there.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.875
He said he was chilly, so he started a fire.

04:11.916 --> 04:14.666
I tried to put it out, but he melted the fire extinguisher

04:14.708 --> 04:17.583
because he thought I was attacking him with an ice spell.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.666
Those books were first editions.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.958
Of sacred Grayskull text?

04:23.416 --> 04:24.750
Of books.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.458
Uh, Teela?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.666
Perhaps you might remedy the situation?

04:29.708 --> 04:31.416
Right. Sorry.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.708
This just isn't something I've seen.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.500
Oh, and now it's raining?

04:42.541 --> 04:43.958
Indoors?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.041
Error.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.125
Also, he thinks he can do magic.

04:48.166 --> 04:51.208
This is no way to welcome Orko the Great.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.291
Who exactly is Orko the Great?

04:53.333 --> 04:56.750
You summon the greatest magician the world has ever known,

04:56.791 --> 04:59.083
and you don't even know who he is?

05:00.750 --> 05:03.166
Spell words not found.

05:05.583 --> 05:08.833
Clearly, my talents are more well-deserved  elsewhere.

05:21.041 --> 05:24.041
Anybody wanna see how I upgraded the jet?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.750
I have the Power!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.708
Missus let you back in the house?

06:12.750 --> 06:14.791
What do you think, Baddrah?

06:16.666 --> 06:17.875
Who's there?

06:17.916 --> 06:19.500
Show yourself.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.708
General?

06:24.750 --> 06:26.500
What are you doing skulking around out here?

06:26.541 --> 06:29.500
Telling you to get back to patrolling the market.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.916
Right. Yes, sir.

06:37.791 --> 06:39.750
Snake in the Grass to Snake Mountain,

06:39.791 --> 06:41.000
you copy?

06:41.041 --> 06:43.333
Why are we doing a snake thing?

06:43.375 --> 06:47.125
What? You prefer "Shin Bone to Knee Bone"?

06:47.166 --> 06:51.750
I'd "prefer" to already have the Kirbinite in my possession.

06:51.791 --> 06:54.750
You'll have it soon enough, Lord Skeletor.

06:54.791 --> 06:59.583
And then we'll all have the havoc you've promised to share.

07:01.958 --> 07:05.166
"Shin Bone to Knee Bone" it is.

07:05.208 --> 07:11.166
You aren't jealous of the Hand Witch's upgrade, are you?

07:13.375 --> 07:14.625
Ignem.

07:16.666 --> 07:18.375
Not in the least.

07:32.791 --> 07:34.875
Eh, uh, not yet.

07:34.916 --> 07:37.708
All right. Soon, we'll be...

08:00.166 --> 08:01.625
Cool.

08:01.666 --> 08:03.041
The angry one can freestyle. The tiger can talk.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.041
Teela does magic two cool ways.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.875
You've got the variable-density musculature thing.

08:07.916 --> 08:09.541
I can't even fix a simple robot

08:09.583 --> 08:13.541
without it thinking it's a blarking wizard or whatever.

08:13.583 --> 08:16.875
If you had stopped to look at anything else in that trunk,

08:16.916 --> 08:18.291
you would've learned

08:18.333 --> 08:20.333
that the tech you used was a legacy recording

08:20.375 --> 08:22.583
of the actual Orko the Great's knowledge.

08:22.625 --> 08:24.041
Why would that be in the castle?

08:24.083 --> 08:26.708
Orko served on Grayskull's court--

08:26.750 --> 08:29.083
also in the book.

08:29.125 --> 08:32.208
If this Orko thinks he's that Orko,

08:32.250 --> 08:35.916
then he's going to go looking for the king... of Eternos.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.833
Which is the last place you wanna go,

08:37.875 --> 08:40.125
seeing as you're caught in the middle of a patriarchal triangle

08:40.166 --> 08:44.166
between the uncle you don't need and the dad you claim to not want.

08:44.208 --> 08:46.083
Why would I want Randor as a dad?

08:46.125 --> 08:49.541
He's a bad king who didn't bother to come looking for me--ever.

08:49.583 --> 08:53.833
And he thinks using Grayskull's power for any reason is illegal.

08:53.875 --> 08:56.083
And as a result, he's hunting several of us,

08:56.125 --> 08:58.083
in various forms, as criminals.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.916
Exactly.

08:59.958 --> 09:02.833
So let's just turn around and let Eternos handle him without us.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.166
Wait.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.458
If the guards manage to neutralize Orko,

09:06.500 --> 09:09.500
they'll probably have the Royal Engineer link him back up to the RK Hive Mind,

09:09.541 --> 09:12.958
which would sync his data with that of every RK unit in the kingdom.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.291
Turning them all into Orkos.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.166
The Orkening.

09:19.416 --> 09:21.541
Sorry. Let me turn that off.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.291
Fine.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.500
As long as we keep a low profile,

09:32.541 --> 09:35.375
how bad could a little trip to the big city be?

09:45.166 --> 09:47.125
Guards! Guards!

09:47.166 --> 09:49.750
My clothing stand's been burgled!

09:49.791 --> 09:52.416
And what, precisely, was taken?

09:56.458 --> 09:59.291
So very much has changed.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.583
How long was I asleep?

10:04.041 --> 10:08.041
So that's your excuse, is it? Sleepwalking to steal?

10:08.083 --> 10:09.875
Sleep-stealing?

10:09.916 --> 10:12.416
Narcoleptic kleptomania?

10:12.458 --> 10:15.083
Narcoleptomania!

10:20.291 --> 10:23.791
Suppose we'll have to add breaking and entering to the list,

10:23.833 --> 10:25.750
along with shoplifting those robes.

10:26.916 --> 10:27.958
As court magician,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.541
I demand you let me pass.

10:30.583 --> 10:34.125
Nice try, but King Randor eliminated that position.

10:35.541 --> 10:38.291
"Randor"? Clearly, it has been a while.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.375
Regardless, allow me to demonstrate

10:40.416 --> 10:44.208
the wonder and awe that is Orko the Great!

10:47.208 --> 10:48.333
Are you seeing this?

10:48.375 --> 10:50.500
-What's going on? -What in Eternia?

10:55.541 --> 10:58.583
Baddrah, be a gent and get someone from the Royal Engineer's office up here

10:58.625 --> 11:00.083
to deal with this...

11:01.708 --> 11:04.125
On guard, fellas. We've got a feisty one.

11:04.166 --> 11:05.666
Ah!

11:05.708 --> 11:07.416
It would seem I'm just a little rusty,  is all.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.583
Watch and be amazed!

11:50.041 --> 11:52.666
--Oh. I see.

12:02.291 --> 12:06.083
Won't they, I don't know, kinda notice a bunch of kids,

12:06.125 --> 12:09.041
a wanted criminal, and a blarking tiger-- no offense...

12:09.083 --> 12:10.333
None taken.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.791
...walking around like we own the joint?

12:12.833 --> 12:14.375
Nah.

12:14.416 --> 12:16.375
This is how I snuck down inside in the first place.

12:16.416 --> 12:19.000
The only person who ever comes down here is the king.

12:19.041 --> 12:21.833
I don't think Orko's made his way to him yet.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.458
How can you tell?

12:24.500 --> 12:26.208
Aside from nothing being on fire.

12:26.250 --> 12:28.750
King Randor's standing right there.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.583
My dad.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.166
Right there.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.750
-He's turning around! -

12:49.083 --> 12:53.291
Have I mentioned that I'm not quite over my fear of cats yet?

12:53.333 --> 12:55.208
Why are you afraid of cats?

12:55.250 --> 12:58.083
Because they're... ...uh, un... un...

12:58.125 --> 13:00.125
Unbelievably ferocious?

13:00.166 --> 13:02.125
Undeniably independent?

13:02.166 --> 13:03.375
Un...

13:04.750 --> 13:06.416
...predictable!

13:08.166 --> 13:09.416
Thief?!

13:14.041 --> 13:15.166
Tiger?

13:15.791 --> 13:17.583
Your Majesty.

13:18.958 --> 13:20.291
Guar--

13:20.333 --> 13:21.541
Time to go.

13:23.291 --> 13:24.708
Guards!

13:31.500 --> 13:34.083
Like taking candy from a baby.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.208
Not that babies should even have candy in the first place.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.583
Sword thief came back for more, huh?

13:52.625 --> 13:54.708
Whole city's on lockdown!

13:54.750 --> 13:56.333
Snake Bone to Shin Mountain.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.458
I'm gonna need an extraction.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.708
--Never mind.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.250
I got a better idea.

14:08.791 --> 14:10.875
I  am Orko the Great!

14:10.916 --> 14:13.208
Why won't anyone believe me?

14:13.250 --> 14:17.291
Well, you could always convince them with a show of might or whatever.

14:17.333 --> 14:21.416
Like when I defeated the lumbering madness that was the Colossor?

14:21.458 --> 14:24.250
Yeah, if that works for you, it works for me.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.875
Initiate maker override.

14:40.125 --> 14:43.041
We wouldn't even be in this mess if I hadn't been in such a hurry

14:43.083 --> 14:45.916
to make that RK better than Kronis ever even tried to.

14:45.958 --> 14:48.625
Duncan, Kronis likes to blow stuff up.

14:48.666 --> 14:51.916
He builds things to destroy other things.

14:51.958 --> 14:52.916
You don't.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.541
Citizens!

14:54.583 --> 14:58.333
Gather round the greatest wizard Eternia has ever known!

14:58.375 --> 15:00.458
Maybe that's a different wizard?

15:00.500 --> 15:03.750
--Nah. Same wizard.

15:03.791 --> 15:05.708
Prepare to be amazed!

15:06.833 --> 15:07.833
I got him.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.666
Stay still!

15:09.708 --> 15:11.333
We could use some backup!

15:16.666 --> 15:18.625
Gather in awe!

15:18.666 --> 15:20.625
He's in maker-override mode,

15:20.666 --> 15:24.083
doing something only Kronis could've told him to do.

15:24.125 --> 15:25.166
Hark!

15:25.208 --> 15:27.500
The Colossor doth approach!

15:39.000 --> 15:41.625
-What's happening? Is this place haunted? -No idea.

15:41.666 --> 15:43.458
What's going on?

15:43.500 --> 15:44.708
Whoa!

15:47.333 --> 15:48.500
This can't be good.

16:00.083 --> 16:04.791
With a lumbering terror, the Colossor towered over the city!

16:09.791 --> 16:12.500
Okay, Orko's moving that armor with his tractor emitters,

16:12.541 --> 16:15.333
which we can overwork to force him into standby mode.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.750
Then I can undo Kronis's override because, ironically enough,

16:18.791 --> 16:20.541
he had me create his password.

16:23.333 --> 16:26.625
Hit the giant monster as hard as you can, repeatedly.

16:26.666 --> 16:28.583
I'll take care of the rest.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.916
By the Power of Grayskull!

17:10.333 --> 17:12.458
We have the Power!

17:15.791 --> 17:17.958
Only Orko the Great--

17:18.000 --> 17:19.583
error: Override in place--

17:19.625 --> 17:22.125
can save you from this beast from beyond!

17:23.500 --> 17:26.583
Tuvar, your elbow is digging into my ribs!

17:26.625 --> 17:28.250
That's not my elbow.

17:28.291 --> 17:30.041
You guys attack from behind.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.333
Where's the fun in that?

17:32.375 --> 17:36.125
Guys, I can fix this. You just need to keep the big guy busy.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.708
I've got the little guy.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.125
Whoa!

17:41.166 --> 17:42.750
No, I don't!

17:44.458 --> 17:46.166
Pick on someone your own size!

17:52.083 --> 17:54.416
Ish. Your own size-ish.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.375
I've got him!

18:08.291 --> 18:10.333
Rammy! Barf Ball?

18:10.375 --> 18:13.250
Joke's on you. I had a heavy lunch.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.250
Man-At-Arms wants us to hit the big guy?

18:19.291 --> 18:21.750
Let's hit him with everything we got.

18:24.208 --> 18:26.125
Lightning Strike!

18:39.333 --> 18:41.708
Power levels critical.

18:51.416 --> 18:53.791
Maybe too heavy of a lunch.

19:09.541 --> 19:11.583
It's now or never, Man-At-Arms!

19:13.041 --> 19:15.666
-I'm working on it! -Need a lift?

19:20.500 --> 19:22.333
I'm the one...

19:22.375 --> 19:24.208
...that fixes things!

19:25.791 --> 19:28.125
Cancel maker override! Password...

19:28.166 --> 19:30.500
...Kronis is the best at everything.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.916
I just wanted people... to believe in me.

19:51.541 --> 19:53.625
There goes the neighborhood.

19:53.666 --> 19:57.125
How did the story of Orko and the Colossor end, little guy?

19:57.166 --> 20:00.250
I... turned it into a tree.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.083
We did it!

20:50.125 --> 20:52.250
That's some fine teamwork, if I do say so myself.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.916
Did we win?

20:54.958 --> 20:56.416
Maker...

20:56.458 --> 20:58.750
...I am a wizard.

21:01.541 --> 21:02.958
We know.

21:06.583 --> 21:10.375
Let's get out of here before they make us pay for all of this.

21:10.416 --> 21:11.500
He-Man?

21:11.541 --> 21:13.375
I'll catch up.

21:13.416 --> 21:16.416
Just make sure I don't have to come rescue you again.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Let's not tell anyone about this, eh, Baddrah?

21:24.041 --> 21:27.333
What happens in the tree stays in the tree.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.583
I guess the king did care.

21:44.250 --> 21:47.083
I cannot believe they've escaped yet again.

21:51.958 --> 21:54.500
What in Eternos is this?

21:54.541 --> 21:57.000
Your Majesty, what does it say?

21:57.041 --> 22:00.041
That my brother Keldor...

22:00.083 --> 22:01.458
is alive.
