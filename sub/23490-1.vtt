WEBVTT

00:42.833 --> 00:45.791
- Everything
looks the same.

00:47.791 --> 00:49.125
- Well, that's deceiving,

00:49.208 --> 00:52.083
'cause everything
has gotten worse.

00:58.958 --> 01:00.250
I got to check on
a bunch of families

01:00.333 --> 01:02.583
that we have in houses.

01:02.666 --> 01:04.291
The city is not housing anybody,

01:04.375 --> 01:08.083
hasn't been housing anybody
in, like, five years.

01:08.166 --> 01:12.375
We just had about 22 families
at the St. Mark's Church.

01:12.666 --> 01:14.083
I got to figure out the farm.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.041
The city came in the
middle of the night

01:16.125 --> 01:18.583
at, like, three in the
morning or whatever,

01:18.666 --> 01:20.208
and dug up our farm.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.833
I got ordained online so
that I could bury people.

01:25.916 --> 01:30.083
'Cause we literally had, like,
four deaths back to back.

01:30.166 --> 01:31.958
I've been fighting for,
like, the last couple years

01:32.041 --> 01:34.333
to try and find out what's
wrong with your brother.

01:34.416 --> 01:37.125
He's been diagnosed
with Asperger's,

01:37.208 --> 01:39.791
which is on the autism spectrum.

02:08.916 --> 02:11.291
Come on, let's take the tour.

02:14.583 --> 02:15.708
- All right.

02:19.416 --> 02:23.583
- The kitchen, the living
room, and your brother's room.

02:33.875 --> 02:36.791
You can take this mattress
here, take it downstairs,

02:36.875 --> 02:38.916
put it in Guillermo's room.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.208
And then I also put your blue
box in your brother's room.

02:43.291 --> 02:45.166
And all your things
are in there.

02:45.250 --> 02:46.291
- All right.

02:47.916 --> 02:50.375
You know, I can help you
clean up later, anything.

02:50.458 --> 02:53.125
- That would be great.

02:53.208 --> 02:56.750
- All right. I'm
gonna go get set up.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.750
- It's good to have
you home, honey.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.708
- It's good to be home.

03:48.708 --> 03:49.791
Hey!

03:49.875 --> 03:51.666
Come here, man, God.

03:53.791 --> 03:54.750
I love you.

03:57.666 --> 03:59.166
Let me look at you.

04:00.541 --> 04:04.416
My God, you turned into
a freaking giant, man!

04:05.916 --> 04:09.166
I dig your hair.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.541
I think I need a haircut.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.208
- It looks good to me.

04:12.291 --> 04:13.791
- You look like a lumberjack.

04:13.875 --> 04:16.083
- All right, thank you.

04:16.166 --> 04:16.875
I know.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.583
I do, don't I?

04:18.666 --> 04:19.500
So what's up?

04:19.583 --> 04:20.833
Tell me everything.

04:20.916 --> 04:21.708
- What do you want
to know about?

04:21.791 --> 04:23.000
- Everything.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.375
What are you into?

04:25.458 --> 04:27.583
- Video games, comic books.

04:27.666 --> 04:28.500
- Right.

04:28.583 --> 04:29.958
- I really like movies.

04:30.041 --> 04:32.083
In fact, one day I
hope to make my own.

04:32.166 --> 04:33.541
- That's awesome.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.208
I'm sure you'd be
incredible at that.

04:35.291 --> 04:37.041
What's up with school?

04:38.166 --> 04:40.625
- Honestly, well, I got into

04:42.541 --> 04:44.791
this pretty high and
prestigious school.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.833
'Cause I'm pretty smart.

04:46.916 --> 04:49.791
And I really enjoy
that aspect of it.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.708
But I'm bullied a lot.

04:52.791 --> 04:53.791
- Really?

04:53.875 --> 04:55.083
- Yeah, it's okay.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.875
In 5th grade, my
first year there,

04:59.916 --> 05:01.958
I was being verbally tormented

05:02.041 --> 05:04.625
by this one kid and his friends.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.333
The teachers really
wouldn't do anything,

05:06.416 --> 05:08.500
'cause they just said
he was just talking

05:08.583 --> 05:11.583
and not doing
anything really bad.

05:11.666 --> 05:12.958
Until the end of
the school year,

05:13.041 --> 05:15.791
we were in the
boys' locker room.

05:15.875 --> 05:17.583
And he beat me up.

05:17.666 --> 05:19.083
- Okay.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.458
- I'm a pacifist, so
I didn't fight back.

05:21.541 --> 05:23.541
But when I could get up,

05:24.416 --> 05:26.541
I stood up and I
screamed at everybody.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.416
'Cause, like, they
were saying stuff

05:28.500 --> 05:31.833
like they're going to kill
me, I shouldn't be alive,

05:31.916 --> 05:33.708
I shouldn't go to school there.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.541
I got insanely mad.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.083
And I started screaming like

05:39.166 --> 05:42.875
no, I deserve to be
here as much as you do.

05:42.958 --> 05:45.000
- I'm not weird.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.125
And you're not gonna kill
me, I'm gonna kill you.

05:47.208 --> 05:51.458
And then the school forced
me to get mandatory therapy.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.583
Not because they
were tormenting me,

05:56.666 --> 05:59.458
but because I said I was
going to kill them out loud.

05:59.541 --> 06:00.375
- Ah.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.708
- Yeah.

06:02.791 --> 06:03.708
- That sounds really hard.

06:03.791 --> 06:05.041
- Mmm hm.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.708
- I'm really sorry.

06:06.791 --> 06:08.833
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

06:08.916 --> 06:10.833
Do you tell Mom about
what's going on?

06:10.916 --> 06:12.791
- We're trying to deal with it.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.000
But Mom's more concerned
with my recent diagnosis
of Asperger's.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.708
- Okay.

06:20.791 --> 06:24.250
- With my anger and everything
that's been going on,

06:24.750 --> 06:26.750
occasionally I feel suicidal

06:26.833 --> 06:28.625
after some of the
stuff they say.

06:28.708 --> 06:29.541
- Right.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.375
- And occasionally homicidal,

06:32.458 --> 06:35.125
of me wanting to get back at
them for the kind of stuff

06:35.208 --> 06:38.791
they do to me with no
repercussions whatsoever.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.958
That's why I really
like just coming home

06:42.041 --> 06:43.791
and getting away from it all.

06:43.875 --> 06:47.708
That's why I'm very excited
for spring break next week.

06:47.791 --> 06:52.000
I really want to get, like,
far away from my school.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.833
- So where's a good pizza spot?

07:00.916 --> 07:03.916
- Over at Joyce,
it's down that way.

07:04.916 --> 07:07.583
- You ever
hang out in this park?

07:07.666 --> 07:09.541
- Sometimes,
I prefer the inside.

07:09.625 --> 07:13.708
But regardless, I come
out here occasionally.

07:13.791 --> 07:15.458
- Cool.

07:15.541 --> 07:17.583
- Not big
for cutting through

07:17.666 --> 07:19.125
- Why is that?

07:19.208 --> 07:20.083
- A lot
of dogs come this way.

07:20.166 --> 07:21.166
- Ah.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.791
Oh, man, it's nice being out.

07:29.666 --> 07:33.250
Been used to seeing a
whole lot of concrete.

07:39.916 --> 07:42.083
- So you still don't
think I need a haircut?

07:42.166 --> 07:44.958
- Maybe,
I'll cut it for you.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.625
- I don't like those chances.

07:49.791 --> 07:51.375
- Umm.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.666
This is like the first
real meal that I've eaten.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.875
- Why, you didn't like
the slop in prison?

07:55.958 --> 07:57.041
- No, I didn't.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.000
That's exactly what it was.

08:00.083 --> 08:02.541
It was like they blended up
dog and served it to you.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.833
- Great conversation to
have while we're eating.

08:04.916 --> 08:09.041
- Right, sorry, I'll
stop talking about it.

08:09.125 --> 08:12.666
- What's it like on the outside?

08:12.750 --> 08:14.000
- It feels weird.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.791
Kind of feels weird 'cause
it feels kind of normal,

08:17.875 --> 08:18.916
you know?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.291
Like I haven't skipped a beat.

08:23.916 --> 08:25.625
But, I don't know.

08:25.708 --> 08:26.958
It also kind of feels like
I've been born again, you know?

08:27.041 --> 08:30.333
It's like fresh,
everything's fresh.

08:30.416 --> 08:32.083
And then sad.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.000
You know, it's kind of sad.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.666
I got a lot of memories,

08:34.750 --> 08:38.208
a lot of stuff that this
neighborhood reminds me of.

08:38.291 --> 08:39.750
- Getting pretty metaphysical,
aren't you?

08:39.833 --> 08:40.625
- Mmm hmm.

08:40.708 --> 08:41.583
What do you think?

08:41.666 --> 08:42.791
Why are we here?

08:42.875 --> 08:44.291
What does this all mean?

08:44.375 --> 08:45.833
- I'm 13, so I haven't
really figured out

08:45.916 --> 08:48.666
those kind of questions yet.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.416
I do like Plato.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.083
- Okay.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.708
- I like his theory of,
his philosophy of the cave.

08:54.791 --> 08:58.791
Imagine you had three people
that were chained in a cave.

08:59.291 --> 09:01.791
And the way they were chained,

09:01.875 --> 09:05.791
they were always looking
at one wall of the cave,

09:05.875 --> 09:07.958
and could never
move their heads.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.708
So they could never see
the other two people

09:09.791 --> 09:13.166
that were there, opposed
from hearing them.

09:13.250 --> 09:17.416
Now imagine somebody brought
a light into the cave,

09:19.125 --> 09:20.916
and a shadow was cast.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.666
That would blow their mind.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.541
Because at that point, they'd
only have seen the wall,

09:27.625 --> 09:29.958
and now there were
images on the wall.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.833
And then if you took
that a step further

09:31.916 --> 09:34.666
by letting one of them go, and
then letting them outside--

09:34.750 --> 09:36.791
- What the fuck? Yo.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.458
- Holy shit.
- Yo, what's up Mark?

09:39.541 --> 09:40.833
- What's up, Galen?
- Man, how you doing, baby?

09:40.916 --> 09:41.791
It's good to see you man.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.166
- Oh my God.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.291
- What's up, G?
How's it going, buddy?

09:44.375 --> 09:45.791
- Damn, man.

09:45.875 --> 09:46.833
- Yeah, man, it's
been a minute, man.

09:46.916 --> 09:48.083
How you been doing?

09:48.166 --> 09:49.166
- I've been great, man.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.791
What are you doing around here?

09:50.875 --> 09:52.291
- Oh, I work around here.
So I'm going to stop and

09:52.375 --> 09:53.250
get something to eat
before I shoot home,

09:53.333 --> 09:54.916
you know what I mean?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.250
- Looking good, man.
- No, you looking good too, man.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.875
- Thank you, bro.
Thank you man.

09:57.958 --> 10:00.083
- I heard you was holding
it down, .

10:00.166 --> 10:01.708
- Yeah, you know, I
was keeping my head up, man,
doing my thing.

10:01.791 --> 10:02.833
- Yeah, that's what's up,
that's what's up, yeah.

10:02.916 --> 10:04.416
- How's the family?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.166
- Family's doing good,
you know what I mean?

10:06.250 --> 10:07.916
You know, and I got a son
now, you know what I mean?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.500
- Shit, that's right.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.166
- Yeah, he's
about to be five, man,

10:11.250 --> 10:13.541
yeah, yeah

10:13.625 --> 10:15.583
So it's good seeing
you though, man.
- Good seeing you too,
man.

10:15.666 --> 10:17.791
I've just been hanging
out with G here.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.041
- Mr. Brainiac.

10:19.125 --> 10:19.958
- Yeah.

10:20.041 --> 10:21.625
- Yeah.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.208
So, um, you heard from
Antoine, you seen Antoine?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.541
- No, I ain't seen
him yet.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.708
- Oh, all right,
okay, cool, yeah.

10:27.791 --> 10:29.708
Well, you know, I'm kind of
busy, you know what I mean,

10:29.791 --> 10:30.750
I'm about to shoot
home and stuff.

10:30.833 --> 10:31.791
So, you know what I mean?

10:31.875 --> 10:33.416
It's good seeing you, man.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
You got to hit me up, man,
so we can get together.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.583
- Yeah, man,
we got to chill.
- Yeah, no doubt, no doubt.

10:36.666 --> 10:37.708
All right, G, man, take it easy.

10:37.791 --> 10:38.791
Always a pleasure.

10:38.875 --> 10:39.791
- Be well.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.333
- No doubt.

10:41.416 --> 10:43.666
- Wow, I can't
believe his son is five.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.666
- Time flies
when you're in a cell.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.291
- My mind would just be thinking

10:48.375 --> 10:50.791
and thinking and
thinking and thinking.

10:50.875 --> 10:54.875
Thinking about everyone, and
everything on the outside.

10:56.916 --> 10:58.416
I couldn't sleep.

11:00.791 --> 11:03.833
And so I had to figure out a way

11:03.916 --> 11:05.708
to practice getting to sleep.

11:05.791 --> 11:09.666
How to get out of my
mind, and into my heart.

11:17.041 --> 11:17.916
I love you.

11:21.166 --> 11:22.041
Good night.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.458
I'll be right here
in the morning.

11:32.541 --> 11:34.250
- Motherfucking cop was
hanging a U-turn.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.125
- And some of these,
they're like,

11:37.208 --> 11:38.250
"Yo open." They asked for the
license.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.458
They're like "Open the door."

11:39.541 --> 11:40.583
- Oh.
- Hey.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.833
- This is my son here.

11:42.916 --> 11:43.958
This is Chucky.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.083
- Chucky, good to meet you, man.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.583
- And this is my man.

11:46.666 --> 11:47.916
- Hey, how's it going?
- Smoke.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.250
- Hey Smoke.
- Nice to meet you.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.125
- Good to meet you.
- Welcome home.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.083
- Thank you, guys.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.625
I'm gonna go out for a walk.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.791
I'll be back in a little bit.

11:57.875 --> 11:58.791
Good to meet you.

11:58.875 --> 11:59.916
- Likewise.
- Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.833
- Be safe, man.
- I will.

12:00.916 --> 12:01.958
Have a great night.

12:02.041 --> 12:02.708
- You too.
- All right.

12:02.791 --> 12:03.583
I love you, Mom.

12:03.666 --> 12:04.708
- I love you, too.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.291
All right, so Chucky

12:06.375 --> 12:07.833
- Can't
tell you all that.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.291
- Yo, Mark!
- Yo.

14:03.375 --> 14:04.833
- What's going on, man?
- What's up, man?

14:04.916 --> 14:06.166
- How you doing, man?

14:06.250 --> 14:08.000
- I'm great, man,
good to see you.

14:08.083 --> 14:09.166
- Good to see you too, man,
almost didn't recognize you.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.125
- Is Antoine here?

14:10.208 --> 14:10.708
- Yeah, he's here man.

14:10.791 --> 14:11.791
- Okay.

14:11.875 --> 14:12.875
- He's, uh, doing his music.

14:12.958 --> 14:14.083
He's, uh, rapping right now, so.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.041
- Oh, great.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.583
- You know, be quiet,

14:16.666 --> 14:18.125
and we'll let him know
that everything's cool.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.791
the world go 'round

14:19.875 --> 14:22.791
the world go 'round

14:22.875 --> 14:24.166
What? Get the...

14:24.250 --> 14:25.125
- For real.

14:26.875 --> 14:27.625
- What the fuck?

14:27.708 --> 14:28.416
- Yo.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.041
- Yo.

14:30.125 --> 14:30.916
- Yo!

14:31.000 --> 14:32.625
- Yo, shit!

14:32.708 --> 14:33.916
- What's up, baby?

14:34.000 --> 14:34.833
How are you?
- My fucking boy.

14:34.916 --> 14:35.750
What's up?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.416
- What's up, man?

14:42.041 --> 14:43.083
- Huh?

14:43.166 --> 14:44.125
- This is dope.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.041
- You like that?

14:50.250 --> 14:51.416
- Damn, my man.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.375
Out here.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.958
- Yeah, I know.

14:54.041 --> 14:55.041
- Here, put
that up for yourself.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.541
- Oh, good luck, man.

14:56.625 --> 14:57.875
Appreciate it, man.
- Something light, man,

14:57.958 --> 14:58.791
a little starter
kit, man, you know?

14:58.875 --> 14:59.875
- Thank you, thank you.

14:59.958 --> 15:00.916
- Get you a phone and all that.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.750
- Mm, mm-hm.

15:02.833 --> 15:03.916
- We'll talk about the rest
later, you know what I'm saying?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.791
Fill you in, man.

15:05.875 --> 15:06.916
So what's up, man?

15:07.000 --> 15:07.833
- Hmm.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.166
You know, just
walking around, man.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.625
Taking everything in.

15:14.708 --> 15:17.166
Just trying to stay
present, you know?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.250
- I know, right?

15:18.333 --> 15:19.208
Breathe the air and shit, right?

15:19.291 --> 15:20.333
- Mmm hmm, just stay--

15:20.416 --> 15:21.250
- See the trees and all that.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.791
- Yeah, man.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.708
- Yeah, look, um, real shit man.

15:27.791 --> 15:31.791
Like I know shit could have
went any other way, man.

15:32.791 --> 15:35.916
You took a nice hit for us, man.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.916
A lot of dudes would have
broke under that pressure, man.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.541
It would be no that without you.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.791
We definitely want to
commend you for that, man.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.333
You know what I'm saying?

15:45.416 --> 15:46.208
- Yeah, no, man, it's
all good, you know?

15:46.291 --> 15:47.541
- Yeah, no doubt.

15:47.625 --> 15:48.291
- I don't expect
shit, man, you know?

15:48.375 --> 15:49.583
- No doubt.

15:49.666 --> 15:51.000
- I'd do that any
other time, man.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.083
- You always don't
want nothing, huh?

15:52.166 --> 15:53.166
You just is you know I mean?

15:53.250 --> 15:54.416
- No, I'm good, you know?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.000
- You--
- I'm just...

15:56.083 --> 15:58.000
- No, I'm good.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.416
I mean this is, you know.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.458
- Ah, no, man.

16:01.541 --> 16:02.791
- This is gonna help.

16:02.875 --> 16:03.916
- Damn!

16:04.000 --> 16:06.916
Yo, remember Cancun?

16:22.750 --> 16:24.125
- Freeze!

16:30.250 --> 16:31.125
- You okay?

16:32.750 --> 16:33.833
- Yeah.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.250
I was just having a bad dream.

16:49.916 --> 16:52.875
- I got to get ready for school.

17:18.875 --> 17:19.791
- Honey!

17:19.875 --> 17:20.833
- Hmm?

17:20.916 --> 17:22.750
- You got to get up, hon.

17:22.833 --> 17:23.791
Get up.

17:23.875 --> 17:24.625
- I'm up.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.583
- We got to
get going, come on.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.208
- All right, well, I
got to meditate first.

17:29.291 --> 17:30.416
- Honey, we
don't have time for that.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.708
Let's get going.

17:31.791 --> 17:33.041
- What?

17:33.125 --> 17:34.166
- I promised
Sister Margaret

17:34.250 --> 17:35.666
we'd be there by nine o'clock.

17:35.750 --> 17:36.541
I also need to take you
around the neighborhood.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.083
- Can I shower?

17:38.166 --> 17:41.291
- No, we don't
have time for that.

17:42.541 --> 17:44.041
Come on, get going.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.750
Please, honey?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.416
- Yes, stop talking.
- All right.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.791
You don't
have to be like that.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.375
- No, whenever you have
crazy news, I like--

17:52.458 --> 17:55.291
- No, no, it's really,
it's good crazy news.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.666
But it's gonna be
like really hard.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.458
I'm running for Vice President.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.916
- I thought for sure when
Jill first called me...

18:07.000 --> 18:08.458
- Who's Jill?

18:08.541 --> 18:09.750
- Jill Stein, she's
from the Green Party.

18:09.833 --> 18:10.916
And...

18:11.000 --> 18:11.875
- Wait.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.666
- I'm totally serious.

18:13.750 --> 18:14.708
- You're running for Vice
President of the United States?

18:14.791 --> 18:16.416
- I'm running for

18:16.500 --> 18:17.958
Vice President of the
United States of America.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.583
Massive amounts of more
speaking engagements.

18:20.666 --> 18:23.333
It means much more problems

18:23.416 --> 18:26.625
with political
police in my life.

18:26.708 --> 18:27.708
- Yeah.
- It means problems

18:27.791 --> 18:30.458
with the IRS, the CIA, the FBI.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.416
- Great.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.791
Maybe you can get me a job?

18:34.875 --> 18:36.083
- Hmm. A job?

18:36.166 --> 18:38.416
That's a different
story.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.750
- Well, I
need a fucking job.

18:39.833 --> 18:42.500
- Honey, everybody needs a job.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.083
In your neighborhood here,

18:44.166 --> 18:47.541
the number one source
of income is welfare.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.041
The second number one
source of income is drugs.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.333
Nobody's got a job, honey.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.250
Guess who's back?

18:56.333 --> 18:57.791
- Hey.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.416
Hi.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.708
- Long time no see.

19:00.791 --> 19:01.625
- Mark!

19:01.708 --> 19:03.833
- How you doing?

19:03.916 --> 19:04.708
- Good to see you.

19:04.791 --> 19:05.625
Welcome back home.

19:05.708 --> 19:06.583
- Thank you so much.

19:06.666 --> 19:08.125
It's great to be home.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.041
- She's been
so good to Guillermo.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.125
- Yeah, you have?

19:10.208 --> 19:11.416
- I thought you were locked up.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.666
- Do you
remember my son?

19:13.750 --> 19:14.958
- Is this your son?
- Yeah, they both home.
- How you doing, man?

19:15.041 --> 19:16.416
- What's up? Good
to see you, man.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.333
- Okay, congratulations.
- They both home.

19:17.416 --> 19:18.416
- Thank you.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.333
- How much time did you do?

19:19.416 --> 19:20.083
- Well, I did 18 years.

19:20.166 --> 19:20.666
- 18 years?

19:20.750 --> 19:21.666
- Yeah.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.333
- Mmm hmm.

19:23.416 --> 19:24.041
- When you're dealing
with addiction and issues,

19:24.125 --> 19:25.416
- Mmm hmm.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.875
- it's like a
double bubble butt.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.666
- Both my parents
died from addiction.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.291
They both OD'd and died.

19:31.375 --> 19:32.833
Yeah.

19:32.916 --> 19:35.416
My mom had three other
guys OD and die on her.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.916
It took me in bad
places, losing jobs,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.416
getting locked up,
being homeless.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.458
And the crazy thing is,
I kept going back for it

19:45.541 --> 19:49.791
knowing the consequences that
was coming for it, you know?

19:50.833 --> 19:52.333
I OD'd eight times.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.791
I still went right back for it.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.125
- I started using drugs

19:57.208 --> 19:59.416
at the age of 16
years old, you know.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.750
And I'm 54 today.

20:02.625 --> 20:06.000
But I came in because my life
was completely unmanageable.

20:06.875 --> 20:09.375
I didn't hurt anybody
outside of my family.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.791
I always hurt my
family, you know.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.625
I was stealing from my family.

20:13.708 --> 20:16.375
- So you can't find employment
because you got felonies?

20:16.458 --> 20:17.666
- Yeah I got a few felonies.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.541
- Mmm hmm.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.541
- Like I came from
a suburban area.

20:21.625 --> 20:22.958
- Mmm hmm.

20:23.041 --> 20:24.166
- They look at me
so different now.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.208
- Mmm hmm.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.583
- Like I'm a piece of gum

20:26.666 --> 20:29.333
stuck under the
table type, you know?

20:29.416 --> 20:31.041
- Well, I've seen
you over the weeks,

20:31.125 --> 20:33.416
and you look like you're
really progressing.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.208
- Thank you.

20:34.291 --> 20:35.500
- The shy guy?

20:36.750 --> 20:38.083
- Um, my name Lloyd.

20:38.166 --> 20:39.666
- Oh, God.
- Recovery name is Lloyd.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.166
- Hey, Lloyd.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.791
- You know, and I'm
in this process.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.666
You know, I'm from Baltimore.

20:44.750 --> 20:45.750
And me too,

20:47.875 --> 20:51.708
like in and out of prison
and stuff like that.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.833
You know, I had 10 years before.

20:57.833 --> 21:02.000
But I didn't use the tools
that I know now to stay clean.

21:05.750 --> 21:09.916
It's a struggle when you
come home from prison.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.291
And doing a lot of time.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.541
It's so hard to
adapt before you--

21:14.625 --> 21:16.166
- How much
time did you do?

21:16.250 --> 21:19.125
- Altogether I did, like,
19 years all, total.

21:19.208 --> 21:20.875
- And you're only 19, right?

21:20.958 --> 21:22.541
- Heh.

21:22.625 --> 21:23.666
- Politicians give you
this great song and dance

21:23.750 --> 21:25.541
in front of the cameras.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.000
When the cameras go off,

21:27.083 --> 21:28.791
you're right back
in the same reality.

21:28.875 --> 21:31.291
- In Pennsylvania, they
spent more money on prisons

21:31.375 --> 21:33.166
than they did on schools.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.125
In your short 86 years,

21:35.958 --> 21:38.291
what would you say
are some of the magic

21:38.375 --> 21:41.375
to trying to exist
in this war zone?

21:41.458 --> 21:43.666
- Well, to be alive is
to be aware, they say.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.166
- Man] Mmm hmm.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.875
- And--

21:46.958 --> 21:49.041
- So you don't think there's
a lot of aware people?

21:49.125 --> 21:50.791
- I think that's very true.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.625
- Mmm.

21:52.708 --> 21:53.666
- Basic
to addiction is unawareness

21:53.750 --> 21:55.166
of what life is all about.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.833
- So why--

21:56.916 --> 21:58.875
- I learned a lot about
recovery when I was in jail.

21:58.958 --> 22:03.125
Because everybody in the jail
cell with me was an addict.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.625
And they were
always talking about

22:05.708 --> 22:08.041
what they were gonna do as
soon as they got out of there.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.625
And would start their
whole cycle over again,

22:10.708 --> 22:11.708
which is going to bring them

22:11.791 --> 22:13.375
right back where they were then.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.291
- You got to have a strong mind.

22:15.375 --> 22:19.583
And I was set on getting
clean and staying clean.

22:19.875 --> 22:23.833
I now have six years, nine
months and four days clean.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.625
- Congratulations.

22:25.708 --> 22:28.875
- God works in mysterious
ways, you know?

22:30.750 --> 22:33.250
It's a good feeling being here.

22:36.541 --> 22:37.791
- Who brought us all together?

22:37.875 --> 22:40.000
- God grant
me the serenity

22:40.083 --> 22:42.791
to accept the things
I cannot change,

22:42.875 --> 22:45.041
the courage to change
the things I can,

22:45.125 --> 22:47.291
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

22:47.375 --> 22:50.416
God's will, not ours be done.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.541
- What's up, man?
- What's up my dude?
- What's up, Hec?

22:52.625 --> 22:54.458
How you doing, man?
- Good, man, I'm doing good.
How you doing?

22:54.541 --> 22:56.416
- I'm good, man,
good to see you.
- Good to see you, too, man.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.666
- Yeah, man.
- What do you know?
- Yeah, been a minute.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.291
- So how long you
gonna be in town?

23:00.375 --> 23:02.041
- I'm here, man,
I'm back now, yeah.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.541
- Assad!

23:03.625 --> 23:04.958
- This is my son, Mark.

23:05.041 --> 23:06.250
- Mark, I've heard
so much about you.

23:06.333 --> 23:07.375
- Yeah, hey man,
nice to meet you.

23:07.458 --> 23:08.500
- It's nice to meet you, too.

23:08.583 --> 23:09.791
- Yeah, thanks for having us.

23:09.875 --> 23:10.791
- He just came home from prison.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.250
- I know.

23:12.333 --> 23:13.750
How's it been to be
back in real life?

23:13.833 --> 23:15.041
- It feels good, man,
feels really good.

23:15.125 --> 23:15.958
- The yard is just bigger.

23:16.041 --> 23:16.875
Watch yourself, though.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.000
- Yeah, that's true.

23:18.083 --> 23:19.250
- I spent half my life there,

23:19.333 --> 23:21.625
until I decided, you know what?

23:21.708 --> 23:24.041
Nothing I do is worth that.

23:24.125 --> 23:25.125
- Mmm hmm.

23:25.208 --> 23:26.541
- Nothing.

23:26.625 --> 23:27.791
You know, people
always use the excuse,

23:27.875 --> 23:29.416
"Well, I have my family.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.125
"Who's feeding them
while you're in the box?"

23:31.208 --> 23:32.625
- Yeah.
- And that's
what you got to do.

23:32.708 --> 23:34.000
Because the system
wants you to go back.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.416
- Mmm hmm.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.875
- They've already
got a bed waiting.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.666
- You know I don't
know shit about cars.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.541
But, I mean, I can clean up.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.875
I can organize tools.

23:44.958 --> 23:47.583
I can be your maid, anything.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.208
- So I
heard you was down with Mo.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.416
- Yeah.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.500
- Okay, how is everything?

23:59.583 --> 24:01.583
- He's doing all
right, you know.

24:01.666 --> 24:03.250
Keeping his head up.

24:03.333 --> 24:04.166
Me and my mom threw
something on his commissary

24:04.250 --> 24:06.125
before we took off.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.291
- You know how
hard it is for him

24:08.375 --> 24:12.500
to try to find work out
here with his record now.

24:13.958 --> 24:18.125
And I know this must be
like, hard, knowing that,

24:18.500 --> 24:22.125
you know, Mo's still
locked up and he's out.

24:24.958 --> 24:27.000
And I know now too,
with, you know,

24:27.083 --> 24:31.250
the passing of your mom,
trying to keep it all together.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.750
I don't know how you do it.

24:39.833 --> 24:41.375
- Well, you got to keep your
head above water, you know?

24:41.458 --> 24:43.708
You got to keep
surviving, you know?

24:43.791 --> 24:45.083
That's all to it.

24:45.166 --> 24:47.750
Life goes on, so
you must continue.

24:47.833 --> 24:49.083
- Yeah.

24:49.166 --> 24:51.875
Anything at all
that you want us to

24:51.958 --> 24:53.375
do for you.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:53.458 --> 24:54.708
- I love you.

24:54.791 --> 24:55.916
- I love you, too.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.416
Always care about you guys.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.416
So, you know, I mean
loaning helping hand

24:59.500 --> 25:01.583
is always good, you know?

25:02.625 --> 25:03.375
- So, mmm.

25:05.625 --> 25:08.000
- I'll try to send
him some more money.

25:08.083 --> 25:09.666
- It's okay.

25:09.750 --> 25:10.500
You know?

25:10.583 --> 25:11.750
We all try hard.

25:14.708 --> 25:16.375
To look out for one
another, you know?

25:16.458 --> 25:18.416
That's what it is all about.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.291
Looking out for one another.

25:20.375 --> 25:22.875
What about if you come
at seven a.m. sharp

25:22.958 --> 25:24.750
and get started?

25:24.833 --> 25:26.166
- She don't play.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.625
If you're not here
at seven o'clock,

25:27.708 --> 25:29.958
you ain't gonna keep the job.

25:32.333 --> 25:35.000
- Hey Mom, I'm gonna walk back.

25:35.083 --> 25:38.041
Got to get a phone and
a couple other things.

25:38.125 --> 25:39.625
- You have more money?

25:39.708 --> 25:40.541
- Yeah.

25:40.625 --> 25:41.750
- From where?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.000
- Antoine.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.041
It's cool, it's fine.

25:49.125 --> 25:51.791
You got nothing to worry about.

25:51.875 --> 25:54.041
- Please don't be stupid.

25:54.125 --> 25:54.875
- I won't.

25:54.958 --> 25:55.708
I'm not.

26:07.666 --> 26:08.750
- Who's this?

26:08.833 --> 26:10.291
- Who do you think, man?

26:10.375 --> 26:11.750
- Holy
shit, what up, bud?

26:13.125 --> 26:14.125
I can't believe
they let you out.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.458
- Yeah, save this number.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.458
- Okay, sick, man.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.625
Welcome home, man.

26:17.708 --> 26:18.708
How you feeling?

26:18.791 --> 26:20.041
- Freezing my ass off right now.

26:20.125 --> 26:22.750
But other than that,
man, I'm happy.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.333
- Yeah, yeah.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.333
- Yeah, so what's this
fucking thing tonight?

27:00.083 --> 27:01.208
- What is it?

27:02.083 --> 27:03.875
- It's your name, Little G.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.375
- My name's Guillermo,
but close enough.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.916
- Are you serious?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.916
Dude, I just got your
name tattooed on me.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.666
- Good job.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.875
- Anyway, check this out.

27:17.250 --> 27:20.666
Now, I know you said how
much you want to make movies.

27:20.750 --> 27:21.666
- Mmm hmm.

27:21.750 --> 27:22.583
- So...

27:24.625 --> 27:26.125
check it out.

27:26.208 --> 27:29.083
Figured you could
start right away.

27:30.166 --> 27:33.708
Yeah, it's one of
those new like HD ones.

27:43.708 --> 27:44.708
You like it?

27:49.333 --> 27:51.791
- What you doing?

27:51.875 --> 27:53.500
- For this freaking
welcome home party

27:53.583 --> 27:56.041
I'm trying to decide between
these three t-shirts.

27:56.125 --> 27:57.666
I got pink one.

27:57.750 --> 27:59.500
- Mmm hmm.

28:01.750 --> 28:02.666
- Wolf one.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.375
- Mmm.

28:05.833 --> 28:09.250
- Or I'm 2 Blessed
To Be Stressed.

28:09.333 --> 28:10.625
- All right,
I think it's definitely

28:10.708 --> 28:12.583
between the wolf and the pink.

28:12.666 --> 28:14.791
- Oh, and what about...

28:17.458 --> 28:19.791
I'm wearing these bad boys.

28:20.708 --> 28:21.958
What do you think?

28:22.041 --> 28:23.083
- I
think you're crazy,

28:23.166 --> 28:24.000
but you should totally do it.

28:24.083 --> 28:24.833
- My man.

28:26.041 --> 28:29.125
- Fuck.

28:29.208 --> 28:33.500
This is like you're dropping
me off at fucking prom,

28:33.875 --> 28:36.333
except I never went to prom.

28:51.666 --> 28:52.583
- Welcome home!

28:52.666 --> 28:55.041
- Thank you.

28:55.125 --> 28:56.666
- Welcome back.
This is Mark. - Nice to finally
meet you.

28:56.750 --> 28:57.708
- Yeah, right?
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.

28:57.791 --> 28:58.625
- Pleasure.
- Bro.

28:58.708 --> 28:59.791
- What's up, homey?

28:59.875 --> 29:00.583
Hey man.
- Good to see you, too.

29:01.708 --> 29:03.291
- Who got me the balloons?

29:04.541 --> 29:06.125
- Neighborhood's changing
like crazy, you know?

29:06.208 --> 29:07.500
- Condos all through the hood.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.000
Construction every block.

29:09.083 --> 29:09.958
- Yeah,
and it's all ugly.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.333
- The Soupery.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.500
- There's a Soupery
under the El.

29:12.583 --> 29:13.916
- What's Soupery?

29:14.000 --> 29:15.375
- It's a soup spot
that's biting off

29:15.458 --> 29:16.875
another soup spot
that's a fish tank.

29:16.958 --> 29:17.958
- Going to the El is
like fancy restaurants.

29:18.041 --> 29:19.083
- Across from the El Bar.

29:19.166 --> 29:20.625
It's not a hooker bar anymore.

29:20.708 --> 29:23.625
- Life was like, it was
very, very, very hard.

29:23.708 --> 29:25.458
That's why I joke around a lot.

29:25.541 --> 29:29.375
'Cause my life has been, that
would be the title, hard.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.125
- Not a good title.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.875
- Okay.

29:34.666 --> 29:36.833
I was raised by my mom.

29:38.333 --> 29:42.541
And she had a relationship with
a man that was very violent.

29:44.708 --> 29:47.625
And beat the crap out of her

29:47.708 --> 29:50.708
on a daily basis
for her whole life.

29:51.958 --> 29:55.708
This bastard wouldn't
just beat my mom, right?

29:56.708 --> 29:59.791
He beat the hell
out of all of us.

30:00.875 --> 30:03.500
All my ribs were broken.

30:03.583 --> 30:06.666
Um, you know, other kids
have earliest memories

30:06.750 --> 30:07.791
of birthday cakes.

30:07.875 --> 30:09.750
Mine was the hospital.

30:09.833 --> 30:11.375
- You?
- Yes, to Mark.

30:11.458 --> 30:12.625
Welcome home, Mark.

30:12.708 --> 30:13.916
This one's for you, buddy.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.833
- Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.666
Roc, you got a cigarette?

30:43.458 --> 30:45.083
You're really cute.

30:53.333 --> 30:55.625
- Right back at you.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.208
- Yo.
- Yo.

31:05.375 --> 31:06.583
- What's up?
- What up, man?

31:06.666 --> 31:07.666
You good?

31:07.750 --> 31:09.125
- Yeah, man, I'm all right.

31:09.208 --> 31:12.458
Just fucking bugging
out a little bit.

31:12.541 --> 31:15.000
It's just a lot
at once, you know?

31:15.083 --> 31:17.458
- I'll
bet, man, I'll bet.

31:17.541 --> 31:18.333
- Fuck.

31:18.416 --> 31:19.708
- I feel you.

31:19.791 --> 31:21.083
- Yeah.

31:21.166 --> 31:23.583
And just like fucking
seeing everybody

31:23.666 --> 31:25.833
just got me thinking
about Maddy, man.

31:25.916 --> 31:26.666
- Mmm.

31:28.875 --> 31:29.708
Yeah.

31:31.166 --> 31:35.000
- You, you
got her new number?

31:36.833 --> 31:37.541
- I do.

31:37.625 --> 31:38.250
- You do?

31:38.333 --> 31:39.083
- Yeah.

31:39.166 --> 31:39.916
- Fuck.

31:45.208 --> 31:46.708
- You know she moved.

31:46.791 --> 31:47.750
- She did?

31:47.833 --> 31:49.083
- Uh huh.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.250
- Where is she staying now?

31:50.333 --> 31:52.125
- She's up on Lehigh.

31:52.208 --> 31:52.958
- On Lehigh?

31:53.041 --> 31:54.750
- Yeah.

31:54.833 --> 31:55.583
- Really?
- Yeah, it's chill
though, you know.

31:55.666 --> 31:56.875
- Fuck.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.583
So what have you
been up to, dawg?

31:58.666 --> 32:01.208
- Oh, you know, was working
in Brooklyn for a bit.

32:01.291 --> 32:02.833
And--
- Yeah.

32:02.916 --> 32:05.625
- get out of town for a
bit, get a couple dollars,

32:05.708 --> 32:06.916
I feel all right.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.250
And then it's just
like same shit.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.708
Just nothing.

32:10.791 --> 32:12.541
Just like it never
happened, you know?

32:12.625 --> 32:14.000
- Yeah.
- And like try and get
a job in North Philly.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.666
- You know, I was
writing a lot, man.

32:15.750 --> 32:16.750
- Writing?

32:16.833 --> 32:18.375
- Yeah, when I was away.

32:18.458 --> 32:19.875
- I'm as sad as your
angel, as sad as your God.

32:19.958 --> 32:22.833
As sad as the
party in shiny fog.

32:22.916 --> 32:25.250
As sad as your money
and all of its lies.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.875
As sad as the people when
they fade away and die.

32:27.958 --> 32:30.750
As sad as your hope,
as sad as your faith,

32:30.833 --> 32:34.833
as sad as your quotes,
and as sad as this space.

32:35.291 --> 32:36.083
- Mmm.

32:37.375 --> 32:38.791
Yo, they probably
didn't tell you,

32:38.875 --> 32:41.708
but Justin got strippers
coming, like right now.

32:41.791 --> 32:43.208
- Hi.
- Oh.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.208
- Good evening, ladies.
- They're so sweet.

32:44.291 --> 32:45.750
- Oh ho.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.750
- Hello, hi everybody.
- It's that time.

32:47.833 --> 32:48.833
- Hello.
- Goodness gracious.

32:48.916 --> 32:50.125
Well, this is our special guest.

32:50.208 --> 32:51.583
He's been away for
a little while.

32:51.666 --> 32:52.541
- Hi.

32:52.625 --> 32:53.625
- Hi, how's it going?

32:53.708 --> 32:55.500
- Nice to meet you.

32:55.583 --> 32:56.083
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Are you guys ready?

32:56.166 --> 32:56.833
- Yeah.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.083
Alright.

33:04.208 --> 33:05.208
- Fantastic.

33:19.541 --> 33:20.541
- Hi.

33:44.083 --> 33:47.958
- When I was 13 years
old, actually your age,

33:48.041 --> 33:51.000
I never went back
home ever again.

33:51.083 --> 33:54.250
I had to live in nine
different institutions

33:54.333 --> 33:56.666
and foster homes and jails.

33:57.791 --> 34:00.708
So I learned at a very young age

34:00.791 --> 34:04.750
about a lot of stuff that
I shouldn't know about.

34:04.833 --> 34:06.250
You know?

34:06.333 --> 34:09.708
Then I figured out what
this one thing was, sex.

34:09.791 --> 34:11.125
I met this guy.

34:11.208 --> 34:13.750
He was your brother's dad.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.416
I was 15, he was 30.

34:17.708 --> 34:19.291
I know.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.625
It's kind of gross to
think about now.

34:21.708 --> 34:23.750
But when I was
growing up

34:23.833 --> 34:25.958
I thought it was...

34:26.041 --> 34:27.875
- Is that even legal age?

34:27.958 --> 34:28.708
- No.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.125
- Yeah.

34:30.208 --> 34:32.583
- He knew how to siphon gas,

34:34.708 --> 34:36.958
do a whole host of
other kinds of things.

34:37.041 --> 34:41.000
And then I found out that he
had a serious heroin addiction,

34:41.083 --> 34:45.083
and I didn't know anything
about addictions then.

34:50.708 --> 34:51.708
- Hey.

34:51.791 --> 34:52.500
- Hey.

34:52.583 --> 34:53.541
- Oh.

34:53.625 --> 34:54.875
- You in here by yourself?

34:54.958 --> 34:56.583
- Yeah, eating some
chips.

34:56.666 --> 34:57.666
- Well, you know
this party is for you, right?

34:57.750 --> 34:58.750
We're here to entertain you.

34:58.833 --> 35:00.250
- Mmm.

35:00.333 --> 35:03.833
- Would you
like to go upstairs?

35:24.291 --> 35:25.208
So what do I do?

35:25.291 --> 35:26.791
- Lay back.
- Okay.

35:50.041 --> 35:51.666
- I love you.

35:56.291 --> 35:57.708
- It's just reminding me

35:57.791 --> 36:00.583
of like how fucking
broken my heart is.

36:03.416 --> 36:04.583
- Who broke your heart?

36:04.666 --> 36:06.083
- Oh, it's a long story.

36:06.166 --> 36:09.416
It's just, I don't even,
this isn't appropriate.

36:11.041 --> 36:13.833
I had this girl that I was with.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.791
And...

36:21.708 --> 36:25.708
she had a kid with some
other dude when I was away.

36:25.958 --> 36:26.958
- Wow.

36:27.041 --> 36:28.750
- Yeah.

36:28.833 --> 36:30.041
I'm sorry, I, is this--

36:30.125 --> 36:31.708
- Are you still in love?

36:31.791 --> 36:32.583
- I don't know.

36:32.666 --> 36:33.708
- You don't know?

36:33.791 --> 36:35.083
- No, I'm,

36:35.166 --> 36:36.708
I just got her number
like out front.

36:36.791 --> 36:39.125
My friend Tim gave me
her new number and--

36:39.208 --> 36:42.083
- Well, you should
give her a call.

36:42.166 --> 36:45.708
- That's what I
was thinking, yeah.

36:45.791 --> 36:46.750
All right, thank you.

36:46.833 --> 36:48.250
- You're welcome.

36:53.458 --> 36:55.208
- Oh!

36:55.291 --> 36:57.333
- One of the most dramatic
horrible memories that I have

36:57.416 --> 36:58.833
is that Mark's dad,

37:01.708 --> 37:04.875
he had a couple baseball bats.

37:04.958 --> 37:07.958
He told me that he was
coming over to kill me.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.583
So he brought over a couple.

37:10.666 --> 37:13.708
He was like in a
blackout on dope.

37:15.291 --> 37:19.500
And at the time, he was like
200 some pounds, huge guy.

37:19.791 --> 37:21.458
And I had your brother.

37:21.541 --> 37:23.333
And we just like
hid in the basement.

37:23.416 --> 37:26.083
And the door was
being knocked down.

37:26.166 --> 37:28.625
And I knew that if
he came in the house,

37:28.708 --> 37:30.250
me and your brother would die.

37:30.333 --> 37:33.958
So I called the Minneapolis
Police Department,

37:34.041 --> 37:36.708
And they sent out
like six squad cars.

37:36.791 --> 37:38.250
But sometimes when people

37:38.333 --> 37:41.583
are really, really high
on alcohol and drugs,

37:42.333 --> 37:44.333
they get this like
super strength.

37:44.416 --> 37:46.625
So they had like the
entire police force

37:46.708 --> 37:50.666
like trying to restrain him
and get him away from us.

37:52.083 --> 37:56.291
And that was only one of like
a million other incidents.

37:58.375 --> 38:01.750
And that's the story
of me and Mark's dad.

38:43.750 --> 38:44.791
- Maddy?

38:45.875 --> 38:47.625
Hey, hi, it's Mark.

38:53.333 --> 38:54.083
Okay.

39:14.541 --> 39:17.208
- Yes, who is that?

39:17.291 --> 39:19.708
Oh, it's cold out there.

39:19.791 --> 39:20.708
- It's good to see you.

39:20.791 --> 39:22.083
- Yeah, you too.

39:22.166 --> 39:22.958
- Thanks for seeing me.

39:23.041 --> 39:23.791
- Yeah.

39:23.875 --> 39:25.541
- Oh, this is...

39:25.625 --> 39:26.541
- Oh yeah, we got a--

39:26.625 --> 39:28.083
- really amazing place.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.625
- Thanks, we
got a lot going on.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.208
- I'm doing good.

39:34.291 --> 39:35.750
I'm staying with
my mom right now.

39:35.833 --> 39:36.750
- Cool.

39:36.833 --> 39:37.583
- And my brother.

39:37.666 --> 39:38.583
- Yeah?

39:38.666 --> 39:39.708
- And...

39:42.708 --> 39:46.666
just trying to find my
way again, you know?

39:46.916 --> 39:47.708
- Umm hmm.

39:49.708 --> 39:50.583
- But things are good.

39:50.666 --> 39:51.583
I'm happy to be home.

39:51.666 --> 39:53.750
- Yeah, I bet.

39:53.833 --> 39:54.708
- Really happy to see you.

39:54.791 --> 39:56.875
Thanks for seeing me.

39:56.958 --> 39:57.625
- Yeah.

39:57.708 --> 39:58.666
- You know?

40:00.375 --> 40:03.875
- I'm gonna to put him
upstairs, just real quick, okay?

40:40.791 --> 40:41.708
So.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.625
- I was really selfish.

40:51.666 --> 40:54.083
I was acting like a child.

40:54.166 --> 40:57.708
You know, I wish I was the
guy I am now back then.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.708
And I'm really sorry
that I hurt you.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.791
And I thought about you,
you know, every day.

41:06.708 --> 41:08.708
- Yeah, I thought
about you, too.

41:08.791 --> 41:09.833
And...

41:17.208 --> 41:19.708
- Ah.

41:23.166 --> 41:23.916
Um.

41:26.791 --> 41:28.666
- You're gonna be okay.

41:40.291 --> 41:43.000
- Okay.

41:49.583 --> 41:52.166
- Don't, like don't bullshit me.

41:53.541 --> 41:54.625
- I'm not bullshitting you.

41:54.708 --> 41:56.583
- Yeah, sure, you know.

41:57.583 --> 41:58.791
- I'm totally fucking fine.

41:58.875 --> 42:00.416
I told you, I had
a couple beers.

42:00.500 --> 42:04.083
- You're fucking nodding
out driving us right now.

42:04.666 --> 42:05.458
Just tell me the truth.

42:05.541 --> 42:06.791
What did you take?

42:15.666 --> 42:19.041
- Good morning.

42:21.791 --> 42:25.583
I was
having a bad dream.

42:25.666 --> 42:28.250
- Sounds depressing.

42:30.791 --> 42:33.208
- I was falling through space.

42:36.083 --> 42:38.083
And it was really crazy,

42:40.708 --> 42:42.541
because I could feel

42:45.416 --> 42:48.708
like every cell in
my entire body--

42:48.791 --> 42:49.625
- Cut.

42:53.875 --> 42:56.166
- What do you mean, cut?

43:23.833 --> 43:26.625
- Democracy starts today
with opening up the debates

43:26.708 --> 43:28.833
for every single political party

43:28.916 --> 43:30.583
in the United States of America.

43:34.166 --> 43:35.375
- Here,
we'll help you.

43:35.458 --> 43:36.291
Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

43:36.375 --> 43:37.333
- Thank you, ladies.

43:37.416 --> 43:38.666
- Watch the flag, please.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.541
- Democracy was
taken away from us,

43:40.625 --> 43:44.791
and we were taken by Secret
Service to a secret location.

43:46.166 --> 43:50.375
And we were handcuffed to
metal chairs for eight hours.

43:55.250 --> 43:56.666
- Typically is a
three-day cycle.

43:56.750 --> 43:58.458
So they spray every three days.

43:58.541 --> 44:00.625
So you get a day
where everybody,

44:00.708 --> 44:04.000
just everybody is in a really
good mood, everyone's up.

44:04.083 --> 44:05.708
And then like, three days later,

44:05.791 --> 44:08.000
like everyone's like really
down, like withdrawn.

44:08.083 --> 44:10.291
Like everyone's like crashing
from, like, the drugs.

44:10.375 --> 44:12.208
And then they spray again.

44:12.291 --> 44:13.875
- No fucking way.
- You'll notice.

44:13.958 --> 44:15.583
You'll notice, like everybody's
happy at the same time,

44:15.666 --> 44:16.833
everybody's pissed
off at the same time.

44:16.916 --> 44:18.708
Just the vibe of the city,

44:18.791 --> 44:22.000
'cause they're fucking
lacing the sky.

44:30.666 --> 44:31.666
- Is this right?

44:31.750 --> 44:32.708
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:32.791 --> 44:33.458
That's good, that's good.

44:33.541 --> 44:34.291
Alright.

44:35.791 --> 44:37.416
So what I need is...

44:41.416 --> 44:43.166
Come on, faster guys.

44:47.666 --> 44:49.125
Hey, you're only
on the first one?

44:49.208 --> 44:51.000
- Yeah.

44:51.083 --> 44:51.833
- Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
Fucking move it!

44:53.666 --> 44:57.541
Here, here, here, here,
go get the next one.

45:08.791 --> 45:09.666
- Okay.

45:09.750 --> 45:11.416
Um, hi, I'm Guillermo.

45:12.666 --> 45:16.208
So I recently got
diagnosed with Asperger's,

45:16.291 --> 45:17.875
which is ridiculous.

45:21.250 --> 45:22.666
When people think of autism,

45:22.750 --> 45:24.208
the first thing that
comes to their head

45:24.291 --> 45:26.916
is a grown man having
a tantrum in public.

45:27.833 --> 45:32.041
It's a little disheartening
to be finally given that,

45:33.416 --> 45:34.833
I don't want to say label.

45:34.916 --> 45:37.291
But for lack of a
better word, label.

45:37.375 --> 45:40.416
It's going to cause
a lot of problems

45:42.166 --> 45:43.708
farther down the
road in my life.

45:43.791 --> 45:46.166
I'm already bullied regularly.

45:50.750 --> 45:53.666
I'm told to kill myself a lot.

45:53.750 --> 45:55.583
One time I got beat
up to the point

45:55.666 --> 45:57.583
where an ambulance
had to pick me up.

45:57.666 --> 46:01.708
And me and my mom are
still paying for that bill.

46:01.791 --> 46:03.708
And I got beat up and
taken by the ambulance

46:03.791 --> 46:07.166
in like 3rd or 4th grade and
I'm in the 7th grade now.

46:07.250 --> 46:09.791
Nowadays I have friends,
so I don't have to sit

46:09.875 --> 46:13.708
next to the garbage cans
during lunch anymore.

46:14.875 --> 46:18.416
A lot of people
look at me weird,

46:18.500 --> 46:20.791
tell me I'm not
supposed to be there.

46:20.875 --> 46:25.041
Being suicidal and my heavy
depression, it's horrible.

46:25.791 --> 46:27.333
It's horrific.

46:27.416 --> 46:29.291
That's why I want to start
out with a documentary,

46:29.375 --> 46:33.541
to teach and show others about
what happens to me and to,

46:34.750 --> 46:38.833
I'm sure, a lot of
kids all over America.

46:38.916 --> 46:40.458
That a lot of people are just...

46:40.541 --> 46:41.958
- I had no idea that
this shit even goes on.

46:42.041 --> 46:44.291
But, so there's a
point in natural labor

46:44.375 --> 46:46.291
where your body is
like, you can't do it.

46:46.375 --> 46:49.583
Your mind is like, you're
not, you can't do it.

46:49.666 --> 46:51.916
She was kind of at that
point where she was like,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.708
"I can't do it, I'm
not gonna do it,
"I can't, I can't do it, I can't
do it."

46:54.791 --> 46:56.458
And we're like, no, you're
doing it, it's happening.

46:56.541 --> 46:58.041
Like the baby is
starting to come out.

46:58.125 --> 46:59.916
It's like right at the
very end of the labor.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.958
So she had to like change
her breathing pattern.

47:02.041 --> 47:04.666
And the midwife was trying
to explain it to her,

47:04.750 --> 47:06.833
and I could tell she
wasn't getting it.

47:06.916 --> 47:10.708
Like she was visibly frustrated
and, like, wasn't doing it.

47:10.791 --> 47:12.541
And they were like,
kept trying to tell her,

47:12.625 --> 47:14.166
and like she wasn't getting it.

47:14.250 --> 47:17.583
And like I saw that,
and in that moment,

47:17.666 --> 47:20.208
it was like my instincts
just like kicked in.

47:20.291 --> 47:22.333
And I was like, I'm just
gonna start doing it.

47:22.416 --> 47:24.416
And she like, we locked eyes.

47:24.500 --> 47:25.833
And she just like settled down

47:25.916 --> 47:27.541
and like started mimicking me.

47:27.625 --> 47:29.708
And we were like
totally in sync, yo.

47:29.791 --> 47:31.958
And like that was the point
where she was able to,

47:32.041 --> 47:33.583
like, get into the right rhythm.

47:33.666 --> 47:35.458
And then was like
properly dilated.

47:35.541 --> 47:37.916
And got through that
like little hump.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.791
It was, like I felt
like part of that

47:40.875 --> 47:42.083
at that point, you know?

47:42.166 --> 47:43.291
And I felt like we
really connected

47:43.375 --> 47:44.875
on some like next level shit.

47:44.958 --> 47:47.291
It was really, it was
fucking beautiful man.

47:47.375 --> 47:48.625
It was--
- Crazy.

47:50.125 --> 47:50.916
- Yeah.

47:52.333 --> 47:54.791
It's really, it's
the coolest shit.

47:56.041 --> 47:56.916
Oh, my bad.

47:58.666 --> 47:59.833
I just, I don't get a
chance to really like

47:59.916 --> 48:01.500
cut loose anymore.

48:01.583 --> 48:03.708
So I was trying to take
advantage of the cat being away.

48:03.791 --> 48:05.250
- No, it's all good, bro.

48:05.333 --> 48:07.458
It's total--
- And so the mouse could play.

48:07.541 --> 48:08.958
- It's totally okay.
- You know what I mean?
But yeah, oh. - It's fine.

48:09.041 --> 48:12.666
- Oh my God,
I love you, dude.

48:14.291 --> 48:16.041
- I got to step out front, dude.
I feel weird.

48:16.125 --> 48:17.458
- Yeah, go ahead, man.

48:17.541 --> 48:18.541
Yeah.

48:18.625 --> 48:20.416
The buzzer doesn't work, though.

48:20.500 --> 48:23.333
So when you want to come back
in just call me or text me.

48:27.666 --> 48:29.833
- I have romantic problems.

48:29.916 --> 48:34.208
When you're a nerd who
is very socially awkward.

48:34.291 --> 48:36.916
I do have this one girl
who I really do like

48:37.000 --> 48:40.041
but I don't that's
gonna go anywhere

48:40.125 --> 48:42.000
'cause she's a lesbian.

48:44.916 --> 48:47.833
- You know, I've been
feeling a little low recently

48:47.916 --> 48:52.083
since I've been back,
and just readjusting.

48:52.166 --> 48:54.666
So what I want to do today

48:54.750 --> 48:56.708
is this loving
kindness meditation

48:56.791 --> 48:58.916
that I'll guide you through.

49:00.708 --> 49:01.875
Close your eyes.

49:03.416 --> 49:07.083
And take one deep breath
in through your nose.

49:19.375 --> 49:21.166
And I want you to say,

49:22.791 --> 49:24.791
may you be free of fear.

49:26.416 --> 49:28.041
May you be at peace.

49:29.916 --> 49:31.500
May you be happy.

49:33.250 --> 49:35.791
I want you to smile at yourself.

49:37.916 --> 49:41.791
And I want you to tell
yourself, I love you.

50:00.291 --> 50:01.041
Hey.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.000
- Oh!

50:02.083 --> 50:03.541
- Good morning.

50:03.625 --> 50:04.583
- Good morning.

50:04.666 --> 50:05.583
Thank you, honey.

50:05.666 --> 50:07.166
- You're welcome.

50:08.166 --> 50:09.666
The least I can do.

50:11.291 --> 50:13.458
We got coffee, bagels, donuts.

50:13.541 --> 50:14.541
- Wow.

50:14.625 --> 50:15.583
- Yeah.

50:15.666 --> 50:16.583
- The whole works.

50:16.666 --> 50:17.791
- Mmm hmm.

50:17.875 --> 50:18.916
He's still asleep.

50:19.000 --> 50:19.958
- Well, you know your brother.

50:20.041 --> 50:21.291
He doesn't like mornings.

50:21.375 --> 50:22.875
- Yeah, no, I know.

50:24.750 --> 50:28.750
- We're gonna take your
brother to see his dad tonight.

50:30.708 --> 50:34.000
He tells me supposedly
that he's clean.

50:36.208 --> 50:37.208
- All right.

50:39.750 --> 50:40.708
- Hey.

50:40.791 --> 50:42.708
Can you give me a ride?

50:42.791 --> 50:43.458
- What's up, man?

50:43.541 --> 50:45.208
- What's up, yo?

50:45.291 --> 50:46.458
How you been?
- How you doing?
I been good, man.

50:46.541 --> 50:47.208
- All right.

50:47.291 --> 50:48.041
Hi, yo, yo.

50:48.125 --> 50:48.916
- Hi Dad.

50:50.375 --> 50:51.083
- You all right?

50:51.166 --> 50:51.833
Hey, Cheri.

50:51.916 --> 50:53.333
- Hi.

50:53.416 --> 50:54.416
- How you doing, man?

50:54.500 --> 50:56.583
- All right, cold.

50:56.666 --> 50:58.333
- The jail you just got out of--

50:58.416 --> 50:59.666
- Yeah. Yeah so--

50:59.750 --> 51:02.541
- is where Guillermo
met his dad.

51:03.666 --> 51:04.708
- Oh, no.

51:07.833 --> 51:08.625
- Yes.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.250
Oh my God, I had
forgotten about that.

51:12.333 --> 51:14.250
- That's
where you met him.

51:14.333 --> 51:15.416
- Well, you were a baby, though.

51:15.500 --> 51:16.166
- Yeah.

51:16.250 --> 51:17.791
- I love my son.

51:17.875 --> 51:19.166
It's fucked up that I saw
you for the first time,

51:19.250 --> 51:20.458
I was in jail.

51:21.958 --> 51:23.083
And I wasn't even there
when you were born.

51:23.166 --> 51:24.666
But can't deny you.

51:26.041 --> 51:27.458
Look at you.

51:27.541 --> 51:28.750
It's a mirror.

51:28.833 --> 51:29.958
- They had to take
his diaper off,

51:30.041 --> 51:31.708
search his diaper, do all this.

51:31.791 --> 51:33.958
- Yeah, because I had a
crazy charge, you know.

51:34.041 --> 51:34.875
I was in maximum.

51:34.958 --> 51:36.583
I had a kidnapping.

51:36.666 --> 51:40.458
But, tell him about
the string yo yo.

51:40.541 --> 51:41.541
- Uh--

51:41.625 --> 51:43.583
- I hadn't seen him in a minute.

51:43.666 --> 51:44.916
I was on the run.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.541
So I was like,
you know, fucking,

51:46.625 --> 51:48.916
I had that little
string on my wrist.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.041
And my son saw it.

51:50.125 --> 51:51.750
So I gave it to him.

51:53.125 --> 51:55.375
And I can't believe
he's still got it.

51:55.458 --> 51:59.625
Now I got to get you a
real bracelet.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.416
- What
about your health?

52:01.500 --> 52:03.000
- I don't even know
how I'm still alive.

52:03.083 --> 52:05.500
I had endocarditis.

52:05.583 --> 52:08.708
I was in the hospital for
a month because of that.

52:08.791 --> 52:11.000
I've OD'd like nine times.

52:13.791 --> 52:15.208
I'm still here.

52:15.291 --> 52:17.416
- How about
your other health stuff?

52:17.500 --> 52:18.583
- Oh.

52:18.666 --> 52:19.666
- The thing.

52:20.500 --> 52:22.041
- The thing.

52:22.125 --> 52:23.458
- That's what your parents
call it, the thing.

52:23.541 --> 52:24.291
- Oh, really?

52:24.375 --> 52:25.625
- Mmm hmm.

52:25.708 --> 52:28.791
- From getting high,
from everything,

52:29.625 --> 52:32.541
I ended up getting
Hep C and HIV.

52:32.625 --> 52:35.291
- He found out, and then
he came over to the house

52:35.375 --> 52:37.625
on Tulip Street high as shit.

52:38.875 --> 52:40.666
- Oh, well, of course.

52:40.750 --> 52:44.958
Like when you get that fucking
news, what do you expect?

52:45.250 --> 52:48.666
Like when I found out, I went
crazy for like three days.

52:48.750 --> 52:52.541
And I was like, might as
well just kill myself now.

52:52.625 --> 52:54.166
Because I was afraid.

52:54.250 --> 52:57.916
I was afraid that he
might have it, you know.

52:59.541 --> 53:01.583
'Cause I didn't know,
like, when I got it.

53:01.666 --> 53:04.416
So I didn't know if I
gave it to your mom.

53:04.500 --> 53:06.833
Like there was so
many variables to it.

53:06.916 --> 53:08.708
- Yeah.
- I thought he was
so full of shit.

53:08.791 --> 53:09.916
I got him in the car.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.666
I didn't care how high he was.

53:12.750 --> 53:16.166
He was screaming outside
my window all night long.

53:16.250 --> 53:18.791
- What happened to your eye?

53:18.875 --> 53:23.125
- I, you know I ran the streets
for a decade, like Philly.

53:24.500 --> 53:27.041
And I did a lot of dirt.

53:27.125 --> 53:31.416
Well, it just happened
that I burned a corner

53:31.500 --> 53:35.750
for a break, that a breaker
stabbed one of those.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.166
Well, the dude I robbed, he
got sentenced to a five to 10.

53:41.625 --> 53:43.416
- Mmm.

53:43.500 --> 53:46.583
- So I don't know how in the
hell, paperwork got fucked up.

53:46.666 --> 53:47.833
Or I don't know.

53:47.916 --> 53:49.500
I was walking on the street,

53:49.583 --> 53:53.666
and the second I turned
around, 'cause I sensed it,

53:53.750 --> 53:55.791
I just seen the golf club.

53:55.875 --> 53:58.875
$1,000, or get hit
with a golf club.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.791
So yeah, that's
what I told them for.

54:02.875 --> 54:04.666
- That's my dad.

54:04.750 --> 54:06.666
- No, don't, I'm
not proud of it, G.

54:06.750 --> 54:08.333
That's what I'm trying to say.

54:08.416 --> 54:11.375
All the shit that I've done,
I wish I could tell you.

54:11.458 --> 54:13.541
I wish I could talk to
you and explain to you

54:13.625 --> 54:15.666
so you don't have to go through

54:15.750 --> 54:17.416
all the shit I've been through.

54:17.500 --> 54:21.333
Literally the first
10 years of your life,

54:21.416 --> 54:23.541
I wasted 'em, you know?

54:23.625 --> 54:26.416
Just because I was getting high.

54:27.916 --> 54:29.291
- You hear the train?

54:29.375 --> 54:30.916
That fucking train, I hate it,

54:31.000 --> 54:35.041
'cause I literally threw
away my life under that El

54:37.125 --> 54:38.541
just for a high.

54:38.625 --> 54:41.541
Anyway, so I'm getting
you a skateboard.

54:41.625 --> 54:43.041
- No.

54:43.125 --> 54:44.666
- Yes, you got to
get out of the house.

54:44.750 --> 54:45.666
- I get out of the house.

54:45.750 --> 54:47.166
I just don't enjoy it.

54:49.375 --> 54:50.041
Yeah I, no.

54:50.125 --> 54:50.916
- Yeah.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.583
- No.

54:52.666 --> 54:54.083
- I got to see your knees
at least scraped once.

54:54.166 --> 54:55.916
- My knees have been
scraped a lot of times.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.208
- Let's play handball.

54:58.291 --> 54:59.166
- No, that hurts.
- Let me teach you
how to play handball.

54:59.250 --> 54:59.958
- Played it, it hurts.

55:00.041 --> 55:01.708
- No it don't.

55:01.791 --> 55:03.583
- Yes it does.
- You wear a glove
if it hurts.

55:03.666 --> 55:05.708
I got to do something positive,

55:05.791 --> 55:08.458
helping my beautiful
son grow up.

55:08.541 --> 55:12.125
But I can see you.

55:13.500 --> 55:14.416
Same hair.

55:14.500 --> 55:16.500
You'll shape up nice.

55:16.583 --> 55:17.416
Yeah.

55:17.500 --> 55:18.666
- I still don't see it.

55:18.750 --> 55:20.541
- You don't see it?

55:20.625 --> 55:21.750
- I don't see the resemblance.

55:21.833 --> 55:22.791
- Can you see a resemblance?

55:22.875 --> 55:23.833
- Absolutely.

55:23.916 --> 55:25.375
- Just take the nose out.

55:25.458 --> 55:27.791
- You got the same big
ass smile, big ass lips.

55:27.875 --> 55:28.708
The hair.

55:30.208 --> 55:32.416
You're both geniuses.

55:32.500 --> 55:33.500
- Yeah, but--

55:33.583 --> 55:35.541
- You're both full of shit.

55:35.625 --> 55:38.791
- I think I figured out
what gives me peace.

55:38.875 --> 55:39.708
- Really?

55:40.833 --> 55:42.166
What's that?

55:42.250 --> 55:43.125
- You guys.

55:44.750 --> 55:48.583
It's good to know that
at least a few people

55:48.666 --> 55:50.833
have my best
intentions at heart,

55:50.916 --> 55:53.958
and care about me to the point

55:54.041 --> 55:57.625
where they only want
to bring me joy,

55:57.708 --> 56:01.625
regardless of what happens
to them or anybody else.

56:10.875 --> 56:12.416
- Hello?

56:12.500 --> 56:14.666
Come on, time to get up.

56:14.750 --> 56:16.041
Happy fun day, boys.

56:16.125 --> 56:17.291
Come on, get up.

56:17.375 --> 56:18.041
Come on.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.208
Hurry up.

56:19.291 --> 56:20.500
We're gonna have
a fun day today.

56:20.583 --> 56:22.625
My name is Cheri Honkala,

56:24.000 --> 56:27.041
and I'm proud to announce today

56:27.125 --> 56:30.958
that I am the first
formerly homeless mother

56:31.041 --> 56:35.250
running for Vice President of
the United States of America.

56:37.291 --> 56:39.083
I know what it's like

56:39.166 --> 56:41.625
to sleep on the streets
of this country,

56:41.708 --> 56:43.583
and so did my son Mark.

56:45.000 --> 56:49.250
We lived together in abandoned
houses, abandoned cars.

56:49.583 --> 56:52.000
Every night in this country,

56:52.875 --> 56:57.083
millions of children will not
have a place to call home.

56:57.958 --> 57:01.291
They, too, will lay
down in the streets,

57:01.375 --> 57:04.625
in the cold each
night in our country.

57:09.750 --> 57:11.125
- Oh, Mark?
- Hmm?

57:12.791 --> 57:14.666
- Do you mind if I get
your help a little later?

57:20.041 --> 57:23.000
- For those families
of this city,

57:23.083 --> 57:25.916
they take away their voice!

57:26.000 --> 57:28.625
What the hell is wrong with you?

57:29.750 --> 57:32.250
- You got to move back,
son, you got to move back.

57:38.583 --> 57:40.416
- people get
right with God.

57:40.500 --> 57:42.125
Do you get high, do
you get

57:42.208 --> 57:43.416
do you get wasted?

57:43.500 --> 57:44.833
Oh, shame on you!

57:46.458 --> 57:50.250
- But this is our country,
not Trump's country!

57:53.666 --> 57:55.250
- Did you get the dog?

57:59.166 --> 58:01.416
- Oh, you should
probably take this, then.

58:01.500 --> 58:03.666
- All right, let me get you.

58:05.875 --> 58:08.291
How are you feeling right now?

58:08.375 --> 58:11.875
- Nervous but
overall pretty good.

58:11.958 --> 58:13.000
- Okay.

58:13.083 --> 58:14.791
That's a good shot.

58:14.875 --> 58:16.625
I'll go around you.

58:17.625 --> 58:18.625
There we go.

58:21.750 --> 58:23.916
- Talk to me about anything.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Pussy, dick.

58:27.500 --> 58:29.291
Uh, I don't know, whatever.

58:29.375 --> 58:33.166
Whatever may cross your mind,
you can talk to me about it.

58:33.250 --> 58:34.791
- What's the worst
thing you've ever done?

58:34.875 --> 58:38.666
- I can't
say that on film

58:38.750 --> 58:42.958
but what I can say is I've
done a lot of bad things.

58:43.416 --> 58:44.291
- Okay.

58:44.375 --> 58:46.000
Why do you like drugs?

58:50.125 --> 58:54.000
- Because they took me
out of myself for a few.

58:56.875 --> 58:59.875
Because I didn't have
to deal with reality

58:59.958 --> 59:02.666
at the moment when I'm high.

59:02.750 --> 59:05.041
At first it was
beautiful, you know.

59:05.125 --> 59:08.625
You could manage, get high and
make your problems go away.

59:08.708 --> 59:10.583
But then it became work

59:14.000 --> 59:17.166
because I had to
come up with money

59:17.250 --> 59:21.500
so I wouldn't be dope sick
so it wasn't no fun no more.

59:21.750 --> 59:24.875
It became actually a
job not to be sick.

59:26.541 --> 59:28.875
- So what's it like
being a father?

59:28.958 --> 59:32.958
- Nice question there.

59:35.333 --> 59:37.625
Honestly, how does it feel?

59:38.833 --> 59:42.666
It feels wonderful
that you're my son.

59:42.750 --> 59:44.125
I love you dearly.

59:45.791 --> 59:49.250
You're 13, and I think I've
missed half of your life

59:52.000 --> 59:53.791
because of me getting high.

59:53.875 --> 59:57.375
So the only thing I can say
is that I'm real proud of you.

59:58.708 --> 1:00:00.750
I love the fact
that you're my son.

1:00:00.833 --> 1:00:04.166
Love the fact that I
know you're gonna do

1:00:04.250 --> 1:00:07.416
real good in your life,
because you're real bright.

1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:09.625
The fact that we can talk

1:00:11.750 --> 1:00:13.625
like, you know, people.

1:00:16.458 --> 1:00:19.250
And I don't have
to, you know, lie

1:00:21.583 --> 1:00:24.416
or come up with excuses
because I'm high

1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:26.583
and I can't come see you.

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:29.708
Don't get high.

1:00:30.625 --> 1:00:34.125
Instead of getting
high, go get some pussy.

1:00:34.208 --> 1:00:37.500
Because that's the
best drug there is.

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:39.666
- Okay.

1:00:39.750 --> 1:00:40.750
- All right?

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.291
So do I give you a hug?

1:00:43.375 --> 1:00:45.416
Come here.

1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:46.708
I love you, G.

1:00:49.500 --> 1:00:51.083
Now say cut.

1:00:51.166 --> 1:00:51.875
- Cut.

1:00:55.875 --> 1:00:58.750
- Good.

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.458
- Like his advice to Guillermo

1:01:04.541 --> 1:01:07.291
was all he needs to
do is get some pussy.

1:01:07.375 --> 1:01:08.375
- Oh really?

1:01:13.708 --> 1:01:16.791
- Why do you have him see him?

1:01:16.875 --> 1:01:19.291
- Guillermo's dad is very sick.

1:01:19.375 --> 1:01:22.625
I don't know, he could, you
know, he could die tomorrow.

1:01:22.708 --> 1:01:25.541
At least he will have had
some kind of
relationship with him,

1:01:25.625 --> 1:01:28.875
or memory of him, you know?
His dad has been
- Yeah, but not like that.

1:01:28.958 --> 1:01:30.750
- totally absent
all these years.

1:01:30.833 --> 1:01:33.000
- Yeah, but that time with him,

1:01:33.083 --> 1:01:36.833
with saying shit like
that to him, is traumatic.

1:01:36.916 --> 1:01:38.500
And it's detrimental.

1:01:38.583 --> 1:01:39.583
- Yeah, well, you should
have interjected something.

1:01:39.666 --> 1:01:41.083
You should have said something.

1:01:41.166 --> 1:01:42.583
- I'm saying something
to you right now.

1:01:42.666 --> 1:01:43.625
- All right, is this
where we get into

1:01:43.708 --> 1:01:45.416
dissecting me as a mom?

1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:48.125
- And this is what
you do all the time.

1:01:48.208 --> 1:01:49.708
It's the same shit.

1:01:52.083 --> 1:01:55.416
- Neither of you
guys' dads ever did shit.

1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:59.708
Your dad never gave me one
dollar, not one dollar.
- But what did you do--

1:02:01.875 --> 1:02:03.416
- Who visited
you in prison?

1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:04.958
It was me.

1:02:05.041 --> 1:02:06.041
- But what have
you done wrong, Mom?

1:02:06.125 --> 1:02:07.666
- I was a teenager mother then.

1:02:07.750 --> 1:02:11.500
The only thing that I knew
how to do was to hustle.

1:02:11.583 --> 1:02:14.375
So I worked for years
in different clubs

1:02:14.458 --> 1:02:16.583
trying to figure out
how to take that money

1:02:16.666 --> 1:02:18.500
and meet the needs of my kids.

1:02:18.583 --> 1:02:20.125
- Yeah but that was a choice
- Keep my kids alive.

1:02:20.208 --> 1:02:21.250
- that you made, you
made that choice.

1:02:21.333 --> 1:02:22.000
- A choice?

1:02:22.083 --> 1:02:23.041
Ain't no choice.

1:02:23.125 --> 1:02:24.458
- It was a fucking choice.

1:02:24.541 --> 1:02:25.916
- Yo,
listen, don't tell me

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.000
about something you
don't know about.

1:02:27.083 --> 1:02:28.125
- I know about it.

1:02:28.208 --> 1:02:29.208
- No you don't. You--

1:02:29.291 --> 1:02:30.708
- You made a choice.

1:02:30.791 --> 1:02:32.625
You could have went and
done something else.

1:02:32.708 --> 1:02:34.916
- You've never worked in that
- You weren't forced into it.

1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:36.500
You weren't like sold
into the fucking--
- You don't want to hear this.

1:02:36.583 --> 1:02:38.458
You have never worked
inside that industry.

1:02:38.541 --> 1:02:39.875
- You could have
chose some other job.
- Bullshit!

1:02:39.958 --> 1:02:41.416
- I didn't have to
come home at night

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:43.083
and then know what the
fuck you were doing.

1:02:43.166 --> 1:02:44.166
- Mark, Mark, Mark.
- As a fucking teenage kid.

1:02:44.250 --> 1:02:45.458
- Mark, Mark, Mark.

1:02:45.541 --> 1:02:46.791
- Like that shit
was inappropriate!

1:02:46.875 --> 1:02:48.416
- Yo.
- That shit fucked me up!

1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:50.666
- Ay, yi, yi.

1:02:50.750 --> 1:02:51.791
- You never want to
talk about the shit
that you did that fucked me up.

1:02:51.875 --> 1:02:53.583
- You don't, okay, Mark, you--

1:02:53.666 --> 1:02:54.625
- Yeah, and you're doing the
same shit with Guillermo.

1:02:54.708 --> 1:02:56.041
- Yo.

1:02:56.125 --> 1:02:57.541
- You're doing the
same thing to him.

1:02:57.625 --> 1:02:59.333
- Listen to me for
God's sakes, you know?

1:02:59.416 --> 1:03:00.416
We have to figure out--

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:02.125
- I'm not talking about,

1:03:02.208 --> 1:03:04.375
we're talking about the mental
health of your children.

1:03:04.458 --> 1:03:06.000
- Yeah, and my kids have
both been in therapy

1:03:06.083 --> 1:03:07.125
their whole life.
- Yes, I'm a grown man now.

1:03:07.208 --> 1:03:08.791
Yeah, that's bullshit, Mom.

1:03:08.875 --> 1:03:11.541
- No, both of my kids
been in therapy, you know?

1:03:11.625 --> 1:03:12.625
- I been, I was therapy--

1:03:12.708 --> 1:03:14.083
- They luckily had those tools.

1:03:14.166 --> 1:03:15.666
- You took me
to fucking therapy

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:18.708
when I was five years
old after my dad left.

1:03:18.791 --> 1:03:20.208
- Yeah, and then you were
in therapy many times.
- I was in therapy for
like a fucking week,

1:03:20.291 --> 1:03:21.083
and I went there and
I drank apple juice.

1:03:21.166 --> 1:03:22.125
- If you didn't--

1:03:22.208 --> 1:03:23.166
- That's not enough, Mom.

1:03:23.250 --> 1:03:24.958
- If you didn't determine

1:03:25.041 --> 1:03:27.041
to take those tools and to
work on your mental health,

1:03:27.125 --> 1:03:29.416
then that's your responsibility.

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:31.625
I've done a damn good job.
My life ain't no different--
- It's a responsibility

1:03:31.708 --> 1:03:32.958
as an adult.

1:03:33.041 --> 1:03:35.041
- My life--
- But when I'm a child,

1:03:35.125 --> 1:03:38.250
when I'm fucking 10 year old
child I didn't have a choice.

1:03:38.333 --> 1:03:40.375
- Listen, listen, yes.
- That's what you did!

1:03:40.458 --> 1:03:41.750
- Let me, wait, wait, wait.
Don't talk over me.
- You put me--

1:03:41.833 --> 1:03:43.208
- You talked.
- I went to prison.

1:03:43.291 --> 1:03:44.750
I ended up with a
fucking drug habit.

1:03:44.833 --> 1:03:46.500
- It's not--
- I did five years in prison.

1:03:46.583 --> 1:03:48.166
Now Guillermo--

1:03:48.250 --> 1:03:49.458
- It's my turn to talk.
- Don't even get me started

1:03:49.541 --> 1:03:50.958
on Guillermo.

1:03:51.041 --> 1:03:52.750
- It's not about
the self-absorption.

1:03:52.833 --> 1:03:54.791
- I'm not fucking self-absorbed,
and neither is my brother.

1:03:54.875 --> 1:03:57.791
I'm in pain, and I'm sad,
and so the fuck is he.

1:03:57.875 --> 1:04:00.333
And it's because of
choices that you made.

1:04:00.416 --> 1:04:02.166
- Well,
you're gonna have to--
- And yes I know how to survive
on the streets.

1:04:02.250 --> 1:04:03.708
- You're gonna
have to toughen up.

1:04:03.791 --> 1:04:06.208
- And I know how to take
care of other people.

1:04:06.291 --> 1:04:08.166
- You're gonna
have to toughen up.
- And I know how to not be
selfish.

1:04:08.250 --> 1:04:09.833
- It's easier--
- But I don't know how
to fucking love myself.

1:04:09.916 --> 1:04:10.791
- Well, then you
better start working on it.

1:04:10.875 --> 1:04:12.291
- And neither does he.

1:04:12.375 --> 1:04:14.208
- You better
start working on it.

1:04:14.291 --> 1:04:16.166
I had you doing
affirmations when you were
a little boy.

1:04:16.250 --> 1:04:20.458
And maybe you need to go
back to some of those
basic tools.

1:04:53.750 --> 1:04:54.666
- Yo, what's up, man?

1:04:54.750 --> 1:04:56.166
It's Mark.

1:04:56.250 --> 1:04:58.750
Holler back at me
when you get a chance.

1:07:03.125 --> 1:07:05.750
- What the fuck are you doing?

1:07:09.333 --> 1:07:12.708
- I'm just letting
loose, having fun, Mom.

1:07:13.583 --> 1:07:15.458
- You're drinking.

1:07:15.541 --> 1:07:16.541
- Yeah, Mom.

1:07:16.625 --> 1:07:18.666
I mean, it's a fucking bar.

1:07:20.208 --> 1:07:23.500
- I don't know how
you can say that.

1:07:23.583 --> 1:07:24.833
You're destroying your life.

1:07:24.916 --> 1:07:27.208
- Mom, I'm fine, all right?

1:07:28.041 --> 1:07:30.458
I'm just trying to have fun.

1:07:31.666 --> 1:07:34.333
You have nothing to worry about.

1:07:43.625 --> 1:07:44.625
- Mom!

1:08:40.916 --> 1:08:41.875
- Shit.

1:08:41.958 --> 1:08:43.208
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:09:15.791 --> 1:09:16.583
Yo.

1:09:18.291 --> 1:09:22.083
Yeah, your glasses,
just take those glasses,

1:09:22.166 --> 1:09:23.125
smash 'em on the ground.

1:09:23.208 --> 1:09:24.458
We'll get you contacts.

1:09:24.541 --> 1:09:26.375
- I don't want contacts.

1:09:26.458 --> 1:09:29.125
I like the way I look, Mark.

1:09:29.208 --> 1:09:30.458
Are you drunk?

1:09:32.083 --> 1:09:32.916
- No.

1:09:39.291 --> 1:09:41.708
- Are you drunk?

1:09:46.750 --> 1:09:48.708
- Yes, I'm a little drunk.

1:09:50.583 --> 1:09:54.000
- You said you
weren't gonna drink anymore.

1:09:54.083 --> 1:09:54.833
- Yeah.

1:09:57.083 --> 1:09:58.083
Yeah, I said that.

1:09:58.166 --> 1:09:59.875
Well, you know, guess what?

1:09:59.958 --> 1:10:03.500
You know, seriously, this
is the most important thing

1:10:03.583 --> 1:10:05.666
I could tell you, man.

1:10:06.583 --> 1:10:09.083
Is that shit is
gonna happen to you,

1:10:09.166 --> 1:10:12.750
and life is just shit
happening to you.

1:10:12.833 --> 1:10:16.125
And a lot of fucked up shit
is gonna happen to you.

1:10:16.208 --> 1:10:18.458
And you're gonna get your
fucking heart broken.

1:10:18.541 --> 1:10:19.958
Some girl is gonna come along,

1:10:20.041 --> 1:10:21.500
and she's gonna grab
your fucking heart,

1:10:21.583 --> 1:10:24.250
smash it in a million
little pieces.

1:10:24.333 --> 1:10:26.000
You're gonna have to
fucking pick up the pieces,

1:10:26.083 --> 1:10:27.541
try and figure out

1:10:27.625 --> 1:10:29.083
how to get the pieces
back into your body.

1:10:29.166 --> 1:10:30.500
And you're gonna
be sitting there

1:10:30.583 --> 1:10:32.666
like what the fuck
just happened.

1:10:32.750 --> 1:10:35.833
And people are gonna
let you down, you know?

1:10:35.916 --> 1:10:38.500
Fucking Mom, Mom is
gonna let you down.

1:10:38.583 --> 1:10:39.625
Your dad is gonna let you down.

1:10:39.708 --> 1:10:41.250
Everyone's gonna let you down.

1:10:41.333 --> 1:10:45.583
Life is just a fucking,
one letdown after another.

1:10:45.666 --> 1:10:47.375
It's just, that's life.

1:10:47.458 --> 1:10:50.875
That's all life is, is just
like one fucking letdown.

1:10:50.958 --> 1:10:52.458
Boom, boom, boom.

1:10:53.708 --> 1:10:55.250
You know?

1:10:55.333 --> 1:10:58.708
And all you can really do
is just fucking control

1:10:59.208 --> 1:11:02.333
like how you react
to being let down.

1:11:03.291 --> 1:11:04.166
That's it.

1:11:04.250 --> 1:11:05.458
There's nothing else.

1:11:05.541 --> 1:11:08.500
And life is just
about controlling

1:11:08.583 --> 1:11:10.000
and that's what life is.

1:11:10.083 --> 1:11:13.458
Look, I honestly, I
don't fucking blame you

1:11:13.541 --> 1:11:15.625
for sitting around playing
video games all day, man.

1:11:15.708 --> 1:11:19.666
'Cause it is a fucking cold,
fucked up world out there.

1:11:21.708 --> 1:11:23.666
It is really fucked up.

1:11:24.708 --> 1:11:25.458
You know?

1:11:27.708 --> 1:11:30.000
You understand what I'm saying?

1:11:30.083 --> 1:11:32.333
Are you listening
to me right now?

1:11:32.416 --> 1:11:33.125
- Yeah.

1:11:33.208 --> 1:11:33.958
- Yeah?

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:37.458
At the end of the day,

1:11:37.541 --> 1:11:40.041
no one really gives
a fuck about you.

1:11:41.333 --> 1:11:42.083
You know?

1:11:43.750 --> 1:11:47.666
You just got to like take
care of yourself, man.

1:11:48.041 --> 1:11:49.541
- Good night, Mark.

1:11:50.583 --> 1:11:51.583
- That's it.

1:11:58.208 --> 1:12:00.000
- It was totally traumatizing.

1:12:00.083 --> 1:12:01.625
'Cause I took your brother,

1:12:01.708 --> 1:12:04.500
and we went to the
Children's Guidance Center.

1:12:04.583 --> 1:12:07.125
And I started taking
him to therapy.

1:12:07.208 --> 1:12:11.416
And, you know, he'd cry, 'cause
he wanted to see his dad.

1:12:12.666 --> 1:12:14.833
And then he'd start
kicking me and biting me,

1:12:14.916 --> 1:12:16.875
'cause he wanted to see his dad.

1:12:16.958 --> 1:12:18.291
The therapist said to me,

1:12:18.375 --> 1:12:21.208
"Cheri, you know,
you're the adult.

1:12:22.958 --> 1:12:27.166
"Even though you're a little
girl, you have to protect him.

1:12:27.416 --> 1:12:30.708
"And the best thing
that you can do is,

1:12:31.541 --> 1:12:34.500
"you know, to tell Mark's
father that he can't see him

1:12:34.583 --> 1:12:38.250
"until he gets off
of drug and alcohol."

1:12:38.333 --> 1:12:40.791
And Mark's dad never came back.

1:12:57.708 --> 1:12:59.083
- I love you, Mom.

1:13:16.583 --> 1:13:17.583
- I dig it.

1:13:19.666 --> 1:13:22.541
- It's parked around
on North Street.

1:13:22.625 --> 1:13:23.458
- Thank you.

1:16:47.208 --> 1:16:48.083
We look alike.

1:16:48.916 --> 1:16:49.750
Yeah.

1:16:49.833 --> 1:16:51.083
- God, what do you say?

1:16:51.166 --> 1:16:51.916
It's...

1:16:53.625 --> 1:16:56.291
I've loved you, I've missed you.

1:16:56.375 --> 1:16:59.333
- I missed you, too.

1:16:59.416 --> 1:17:02.958
- I think back,

1:17:03.041 --> 1:17:06.041
that period of my
life and the time.

1:17:09.541 --> 1:17:12.583
I really wanted to
be as, I don't know.

1:17:13.708 --> 1:17:14.833
- Wow.

1:17:16.541 --> 1:17:18.833
- Little Mark.

1:17:19.833 --> 1:17:21.708
- How old was I here?

1:17:22.833 --> 1:17:24.458
- Four or five.

1:17:24.541 --> 1:17:25.375
I'll have to ask.

1:17:25.458 --> 1:17:27.875
I forgot to ask Carolyn.

1:17:27.958 --> 1:17:29.541
- It's really crazy.

1:17:31.666 --> 1:17:32.875
How do you feel?

1:17:34.541 --> 1:17:36.583
- With my hands.

1:17:36.666 --> 1:17:38.333
- Yeah.

1:17:38.416 --> 1:17:41.083
- Right now I'm feeling a
lot of joy and happiness.

1:17:41.166 --> 1:17:42.000
- Yeah.

1:17:42.083 --> 1:17:43.333
- Just great to see you.

1:17:43.416 --> 1:17:44.375
- Mmm hmm.

1:17:44.458 --> 1:17:46.166
Well, Dad, I guess I'm...

1:17:46.250 --> 1:17:47.958
- Glad to hear you say Dad.

1:17:48.041 --> 1:17:49.458
That's a trip.

1:17:49.541 --> 1:17:51.208
I sure want to go
fishing with you.

1:17:51.291 --> 1:17:52.666
That'd be fun to sit in a boat,

1:17:52.750 --> 1:17:55.708
make a nice lunch
and sit in the boat.

1:17:55.791 --> 1:17:57.500
- That'd be cool.

1:17:57.583 --> 1:17:59.750
- I like to get big sucker
minnows and a big bobber,

1:17:59.833 --> 1:18:01.250
and I just throw it out there.

1:18:01.333 --> 1:18:02.291
And it's--

1:18:02.375 --> 1:18:03.666
- I've never been fishing.

1:18:03.750 --> 1:18:04.375
- Never been fishing?

1:18:04.458 --> 1:18:05.458
- No.

1:18:05.541 --> 1:18:07.250
- Oh, God, that'll be great.

1:18:07.333 --> 1:18:08.333
- Yeah.

1:18:08.416 --> 1:18:09.750
Yeah, it'd be nice to...

1:18:09.833 --> 1:18:10.666
- Oh yeah.

1:18:12.250 --> 1:18:13.583
- do some like father
and son shit.

1:18:13.666 --> 1:18:14.833
- Yeah.

1:18:14.916 --> 1:18:16.083
- Yeah.

1:18:16.166 --> 1:18:17.666
- We were a happy little family,

1:18:17.750 --> 1:18:21.875
and then just kind of
went to shit.

1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:24.083
You remember riding
in the blue truck?

1:18:24.166 --> 1:18:26.458
And I fight authority but
authority always wins,

1:18:26.541 --> 1:18:27.958
that was our song?

1:18:28.041 --> 1:18:29.750
We had the boom box
in the truck and...

1:18:29.833 --> 1:18:33.500
- I think the last time that
I remember that we talked,

1:18:36.083 --> 1:18:37.833
I was with my mom.

1:18:37.916 --> 1:18:41.250
And I think you were
coming to pick me up.

1:18:41.333 --> 1:18:44.375
And I was gonna get
like some Transformers

1:18:44.458 --> 1:18:45.666
or something like that.

1:18:45.750 --> 1:18:47.833
- Yeah, bringing
you Optimus Prime.

1:18:47.916 --> 1:18:48.750
- Mmm hmm.

1:18:48.833 --> 1:18:49.958
And then, um.

1:18:52.541 --> 1:18:53.708
Yeah and then--

1:18:53.791 --> 1:18:55.583
- I didn't make it, you know?

1:18:55.666 --> 1:18:57.166
I didn't show up.

1:19:00.125 --> 1:19:03.458
Because of the
drinking and drugs.

1:19:03.541 --> 1:19:04.375
That's...

1:19:05.666 --> 1:19:07.208
- Yeah.

1:19:07.291 --> 1:19:10.416
- Addiction, it's
a horrible thing.

1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:12.583
Something I passed on.

1:19:12.666 --> 1:19:14.291
- Yeah.

1:19:14.375 --> 1:19:17.666
- But still, that's no fucking
excuse to, I don't know.

1:19:20.458 --> 1:19:22.500
- Did you, were you
able to get sober ever

1:19:22.583 --> 1:19:24.625
and get any time
together and stuff?

1:19:24.708 --> 1:19:27.083
- Oh yeah, I've been 20 years.

1:19:28.583 --> 1:19:30.666
- 20 years, holy shit.

1:19:34.458 --> 1:19:35.958
- How long you had
this house for?

1:19:36.041 --> 1:19:37.416
- Six years, we rent.

1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:38.541
- Okay.

1:19:40.416 --> 1:19:42.583
- We really went through some
tough financial times, boy.

1:19:42.666 --> 1:19:44.125
- Yeah?

1:19:44.208 --> 1:19:46.416
- I had started out, we
moved to Grand Rapids

1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:48.291
and I bought a
home, and lost that.

1:19:48.375 --> 1:19:49.083
And--

1:19:49.166 --> 1:19:50.125
- Really?

1:19:50.208 --> 1:19:52.166
- It kind of slipped away.

1:19:52.250 --> 1:19:53.791
I reached out to my family

1:19:53.875 --> 1:19:57.916
who didn't want anything
to do with me for 20 years

1:20:00.125 --> 1:20:01.333
to help me.

1:20:01.416 --> 1:20:03.666
And they, my dad
wouldn't help me.

1:20:04.833 --> 1:20:06.375
But then my dad got sick,

1:20:06.458 --> 1:20:08.500
but then I got to see him
again before he passed.

1:20:08.583 --> 1:20:09.625
So, I--

1:20:09.708 --> 1:20:10.708
- And that's my grandpa?

1:20:10.791 --> 1:20:11.750
- Yeah.

1:20:11.833 --> 1:20:14.125
- Did I ever meet him?

1:20:14.208 --> 1:20:15.916
- Yeah, I don't know.

1:20:17.791 --> 1:20:20.333
I have to ask
Carolyn, she'll know.

1:20:20.416 --> 1:20:21.208
- What was his name?

1:20:21.291 --> 1:20:22.041
- John.

1:20:22.125 --> 1:20:23.041
- John.

1:20:23.125 --> 1:20:24.666
What'd he die of?

1:20:24.750 --> 1:20:25.541
- Cancer.

1:20:28.875 --> 1:20:30.583
- Well, I'm still like,

1:20:30.666 --> 1:20:31.791
I can't believe I'm standing
across from you right now.

1:20:31.875 --> 1:20:34.375
It's definitely really weird.

1:20:36.791 --> 1:20:38.583
- It's awesome, man.

1:20:38.666 --> 1:20:39.958
- It is.

1:20:40.041 --> 1:20:42.083
- It's kind of
like, I don't know.

1:20:42.166 --> 1:20:45.666
Well, 20 years of shit
kind of went away.

1:20:47.583 --> 1:20:49.875
Or the years I'd be--

1:20:49.958 --> 1:20:50.833
- Yeah, 30.

1:20:52.083 --> 1:20:53.458
- 30, oh.

1:20:53.541 --> 1:20:55.500
- How old
are you now, Dad?

1:20:55.583 --> 1:20:56.958
- I'm 60.

1:20:57.041 --> 1:20:59.333
I'll be 61 April 7th.

1:20:59.416 --> 1:21:00.250
- Oh, wow.

1:21:01.541 --> 1:21:03.458
I like your tattoos.

1:21:03.541 --> 1:21:06.500
- Yeah, I'm really
a huge Viking fan.

1:21:08.416 --> 1:21:09.583
My heroes.

1:21:09.666 --> 1:21:10.416
- Oh wow.

1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:11.541
- Jerry Garcia.

1:21:13.291 --> 1:21:14.791
Jimi Hendrix.

1:21:14.875 --> 1:21:17.291
- That's fucking incredible.

1:21:18.416 --> 1:21:20.583
- And we got John Lennon.

1:21:20.666 --> 1:21:21.833
- Jesus.

1:21:21.916 --> 1:21:24.583
- Love John, so does your mom.

1:21:24.666 --> 1:21:26.333
And Janis Joplin.

1:21:26.416 --> 1:21:28.541
Oh, I had a crush on her.

1:21:31.500 --> 1:21:32.625
Oh, cool!

1:21:32.708 --> 1:21:33.458
Wow.

1:21:34.666 --> 1:21:35.375
- Isn't that cool?

1:21:35.458 --> 1:21:36.125
- That is cool!

1:21:36.208 --> 1:21:37.250
- I know.

1:21:37.333 --> 1:21:38.708
- Like all those too, already.

1:21:38.791 --> 1:21:39.958
- Yeah.

1:21:42.541 --> 1:21:44.458
What's this about on your arm?

1:21:44.541 --> 1:21:46.833
- Oh I have, from dialysis.

1:21:46.916 --> 1:21:48.166
So I got to...

1:21:49.166 --> 1:21:50.041
- Oh, right.

1:21:50.125 --> 1:21:51.583
- keep it bandaged.

1:21:51.666 --> 1:21:55.083
Last April I went, had
a stem cell transplant.

1:21:55.166 --> 1:21:58.458
Well, that's where they
take out, they go in,

1:21:58.541 --> 1:22:01.541
get all this horrible chemo
that kills everything in you.

1:22:01.625 --> 1:22:05.333
Then they harvest some
good stem cells out of me,

1:22:05.416 --> 1:22:07.708
and then they put it back in.

1:22:07.791 --> 1:22:09.291
- Yeah.

1:22:09.375 --> 1:22:11.041
- 'Cause the cancer
ate up my kidneys,

1:22:11.125 --> 1:22:13.791
so I'm on dialysis
three times a week.

1:22:13.875 --> 1:22:18.083
And that's lately really
been kicking my ass.

1:22:18.333 --> 1:22:19.333
- What is that like?

1:22:19.416 --> 1:22:21.125
What do you have to do?

1:22:21.208 --> 1:22:24.291
- You go in, and they take
out your blood and clean it,

1:22:24.375 --> 1:22:25.666
and put it back in.

1:22:25.750 --> 1:22:28.041
Four hours in the chair.

1:22:28.125 --> 1:22:30.541
Appetite still is a problem.

1:22:31.916 --> 1:22:34.583
Don't feel like eating,
that's hard to explain.

1:22:34.666 --> 1:22:35.666
- Mmm hmm.

1:22:37.541 --> 1:22:39.583
- Because you want
to keep on weight.

1:22:39.666 --> 1:22:42.083
You don't want to lose weight.

1:22:42.166 --> 1:22:45.166
Yeah, because shit,
I used to weigh,

1:22:46.541 --> 1:22:48.541
well, I lost almost 100 pounds.

1:22:48.625 --> 1:22:50.458
I used to weigh 280.

1:22:50.541 --> 1:22:51.583
- Wow.

1:22:51.666 --> 1:22:53.625
- And now I'm down to 176.

1:22:55.541 --> 1:22:57.541
It just shh, consumes you.

1:22:59.666 --> 1:23:01.500
I remember my kidney
doctor, he talked to me.

1:23:01.583 --> 1:23:04.458
And he said when
he first met me,

1:23:04.541 --> 1:23:07.958
that he said "I gave
you six months to live."

1:23:08.041 --> 1:23:10.416
And that really freaked me out.

1:23:10.500 --> 1:23:11.958
- Yeah.

1:23:12.041 --> 1:23:14.958
- You know, it's working
to make its comeback.

1:23:15.041 --> 1:23:17.083
That's what bad about cancer.

1:23:17.166 --> 1:23:18.833
You get rid of it for a while,

1:23:18.916 --> 1:23:21.333
but then it's like it gets
pissed and it comes back.

1:23:21.416 --> 1:23:23.458
- What kind of
cancer was it again?

1:23:23.541 --> 1:23:25.666
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1:23:26.916 --> 1:23:29.458
It's cancer of my blood.

1:23:29.541 --> 1:23:30.458
- Mmm hmm.

1:23:30.541 --> 1:23:31.833
- And...

1:23:31.916 --> 1:23:35.458
- I'd hate to
think like .

1:23:35.541 --> 1:23:38.166
- Yeah, get back
together and fucking die?

1:23:38.250 --> 1:23:40.791
Yeah, that's,

1:23:40.875 --> 1:23:42.083
that's fucked.

1:23:42.166 --> 1:23:44.083
It's not supposed
to be that way.

1:23:44.166 --> 1:23:46.416
- No, I don't want
it to be that way.

1:23:46.500 --> 1:23:48.291
- With all those years that I,

1:23:48.375 --> 1:23:50.333
I've wasted them, you know?

1:23:50.416 --> 1:23:51.708
It's just fucked up.

1:23:51.791 --> 1:23:53.791
And I don't want
it to be that way.

1:23:53.875 --> 1:23:56.041
I .

1:24:00.041 --> 1:24:02.541
I wish .

1:24:08.625 --> 1:24:11.208
A brightness, happiness.

1:24:11.291 --> 1:24:15.041
'Cause when I was excited
for stuff like that.

1:24:29.541 --> 1:24:32.541
God I loved you, honey,
when you were born.

1:24:32.625 --> 1:24:33.666
And, oh.

1:25:08.166 --> 1:25:12.291
At dusk there's a slight delay

1:26:11.125 --> 1:26:13.833
- Well, not
first-person point of view.

1:26:13.916 --> 1:26:14.791
Let's try.

1:26:22.875 --> 1:26:26.875
- Oh.

1:26:27.916 --> 1:26:31.958
- All right, take
care man, I love you.

1:26:32.041 --> 1:26:32.708
Good?

1:26:32.791 --> 1:26:33.833
- Yeah.
