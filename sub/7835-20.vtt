D'oh!

00:23.819 --> 00:26.278
Welcome to second
grade gymnastics.

00:26.363 --> 00:28.155
We'll get started
as soon as the
previous class

00:28.240 --> 00:29.907
finishes up
on the equipment.

00:30.283 --> 00:32.076
Don't worry.

00:32.159 --> 00:35.287
You can win them back
if you stick the landing.

00:37.791 --> 00:39.125
Big smile.

00:40.627 --> 00:44.964
Come on, ladies.
Faster, higher, better!

00:52.264 --> 00:54.265
My bad.

00:54.641 --> 00:58.310
Lisa, gym isn't just
about encouraging fitness,

00:58.395 --> 01:00.479
it's also about
exposing weakness!

01:01.440 --> 01:02.606
Check minus.

01:02.691 --> 01:05.735
Are you mad, Brunella?
You can't fail Lisa.

01:06.319 --> 01:08.237
She's the only child
keeping this
school accredited.

01:08.321 --> 01:09.447
Without her,
we'd have to release

01:09.531 --> 01:11.490
these children
back into the forest.

01:11.575 --> 01:15.286
So, let's just turn
that minus into a plus.

01:17.497 --> 01:19.498
Skinner, I took an oath!

01:19.750 --> 01:23.043
And by Xena,
this girl's failing gym!

01:23.211 --> 01:25.379
Perhaps we could get
her a private coach?

01:25.464 --> 01:28.132
Well, I know a coach.
But he's tough.

01:28.216 --> 01:30.009
He defected
into East Germany.

01:37.893 --> 01:39.059
Okay.

01:39.144 --> 01:43.773
For next exercise,
put hands on hips,
jump out window,

01:43.857 --> 01:48.402
and go tell parents to
stop wasting my time
with failure child!

01:52.407 --> 01:54.909
Faster! Lift your knees!

01:56.870 --> 01:58.871
Look, Lisa!
There's an opening!

01:58.955 --> 02:01.832
Who wants to
put on a leotard
and get screamed at?

02:01.917 --> 02:04.585
Well, hookers
and Spider-Man.

02:04.669 --> 02:06.712
Forget it.
I'm going home.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.262
Get up, Liser.

02:15.555 --> 02:17.139
President Kennedy!

02:17.224 --> 02:18.432
That's right, Liser.

02:18.975 --> 02:20.518
Academics are important.

02:20.602 --> 02:23.145
But you must also train
your body with vigor.

02:23.230 --> 02:27.775
That's why I created
the President's Council
on Physical Fitness, yes.

02:27.859 --> 02:29.819
Well, I can't argue
with the man

02:29.903 --> 02:31.779
who wrote
Profiles in Courage.

02:32.072 --> 02:36.283
Yes. Uh, I wrote it.
Well, good luck, Liser.

02:36.618 --> 02:38.702
Thanks! I'll see you
in heaven!

02:38.787 --> 02:42.081
Uh, yes,
uh, heaven.

02:48.839 --> 02:51.882
My little munchkin
bumped her pumpkin.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.425
Are you okay, Lisa?

02:53.510 --> 02:54.844
I'm more than okay!

02:55.595 --> 02:57.721
Ich bin ein gymnast.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.475
Aw, she must've dreamt
about Hitler again.

03:06.815 --> 03:09.984
There you go.
A Laffy Meal for you,

03:10.068 --> 03:12.570
and a Nostalgia Meal
for me.

03:13.154 --> 03:15.281
Oh, boy!
This takes me back!

03:15.615 --> 03:19.910
Two ration stamps
and an artillery shell
full of oleo!

03:20.161 --> 03:22.121
What's your
nostalgia prize,
Grampa?

03:22.289 --> 03:24.248
Liberace action figure.

03:24.624 --> 03:27.084
Party tonight at
Roddy McDowall's.

03:28.211 --> 03:30.421
I got a plastic
Krusty-saurus.

03:31.798 --> 03:32.923
Hmm.

03:33.508 --> 03:35.968
A mosquito?
How'd that get in there?

03:42.976 --> 03:46.353
Laziness is
counter-revolutionary.

03:46.438 --> 03:49.315
Questions are decadent!

03:49.399 --> 03:52.651
Fast hands mean
less whipping.

04:00.952 --> 04:01.994
Ow!

04:02.329 --> 04:04.246
Skeeter bites
are good luck.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.290
Scratch it and
you get a wish.

04:09.002 --> 04:12.212
I don't feel so good.
Can you take me
to the hospital?

04:12.297 --> 04:15.174
Finally we're doing
something I want to do.

04:16.301 --> 04:21.346
Just relax. Think of
floor as full of snakes.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.849
You fall, they kill you!

04:24.351 --> 04:26.769
Relax, relax.

04:27.270 --> 04:28.646
And snakes!

04:33.652 --> 04:37.154
Bravo, little girl.
Great progress!

04:37.322 --> 04:38.948
You deserve reward.

04:39.032 --> 04:41.533
Here is your cat back,
good as new.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.955
Oh, thank you.
Do you think
I'll pass gym this term?

04:46.039 --> 04:49.541
Is no problem.
God give you greatest gift.

04:49.668 --> 04:52.419
Big head like beach ball
made of bone.

04:52.504 --> 04:54.213
Gives you perfect balance.

04:58.009 --> 04:58.968
Yeah! Excellent!
All right!

04:59.052 --> 05:03.222
See you tomorrow.
Rest your giant head.
I am Lugash.

05:07.352 --> 05:09.687
You're reading
Gravity's Rainbow?

05:09.771 --> 05:11.063
Re-reading.

05:11.147 --> 05:14.942
Sorry. What are you
guys talking about?
I was making fractals.

05:15.026 --> 05:16.568
These girls
are brilliant.

05:16.653 --> 05:18.904
I finally found kids
I can relate to.

05:18.989 --> 05:22.950
You guys are so cool!
I can't believe I never
met you before!

05:23.034 --> 05:25.077
Well, I'm Tina.
And this is Carrie.

05:25.161 --> 05:26.328
Maybe we could
hang out together.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.038
Oh, I'd love to.

05:28.832 --> 05:32.001
You girls were all great.
Cats back for everyone.

05:32.085 --> 05:33.085
I had a dog.

05:33.169 --> 05:34.169
Is cat now.

05:36.881 --> 05:38.132
Need a ride
back to campus?

05:38.216 --> 05:39.758
Campus?

05:45.265 --> 05:47.349
You guys are
college students!

05:47.434 --> 05:49.810
Yeah. But with our
small gymnast bodies,

05:49.894 --> 05:52.104
everyone always thinks
we're way younger.

05:52.188 --> 05:54.064
Aren't you in college?

05:55.817 --> 05:59.445
Of course.
Where do you think I go?
Baby school?

06:01.614 --> 06:03.157
See you tomorrow, Lisa!

06:03.241 --> 06:05.909
We find out what
five minus three is!

06:06.536 --> 06:07.745
Um...

06:07.912 --> 06:10.873
I'm a teacher's aide
in a very special class.

06:10.957 --> 06:12.458
No, Lisa. We're both in...

06:12.542 --> 06:13.959
Go! Go! Go!

06:14.836 --> 06:16.879
Why do people
run from me?

06:23.678 --> 06:27.139
Wow.
I'm actually passing
as a college student.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.476
And they don't
have a Blue's Clue.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.519
Whoops. Gotta age it up.

06:33.271 --> 06:35.105
Life sucks.
Totally.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.190
Phew.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.400
So what dorm
do you live in?

06:38.485 --> 06:40.694
Actually, I'm off campus.

06:40.945 --> 06:44.698
I share a house
with a couple of girls,
a couple of guys.

06:44.991 --> 06:47.367
Guys, huh?
Are they cute?

06:47.535 --> 06:49.745
Well,
Bart's kind of... No!

06:51.122 --> 06:54.333
I get knocked down
I get knocked down again

06:54.417 --> 06:56.251
You are never
gonna knock me down!

06:56.336 --> 06:58.003
Whoa! Party house.

07:00.131 --> 07:01.882
Hey,
where's my keg?

07:02.759 --> 07:04.259
Mom's not gonna like that.

07:04.344 --> 07:05.385
Who's Mom?

07:05.470 --> 07:08.931
That's what
we call the gay guy
who lives with us.

07:09.808 --> 07:11.225
Hey, you doing
anything tomorrow night?

07:11.309 --> 07:13.310
Robert Pinsky's
reading at CafÃ© Kafka.

07:13.394 --> 07:16.939
Robert Pinsky?
The former poet laureate?

07:17.023 --> 07:19.775
It's gonna be great.
The three of us
can split a scone.

07:19.859 --> 07:20.859
Non-dairy?

07:20.944 --> 07:22.194
Duh!

07:22.278 --> 07:24.655
I take a whiskey drink
I take a chocolate drink

07:24.739 --> 07:27.241
And when I have to pee
I use the kitchen sink

07:27.325 --> 07:30.369
I sing the song
that reminds me
I'm a urinating guy!

07:30.453 --> 07:31.745
I'll see you tomorrow!

07:31.830 --> 07:33.038
See you!

07:33.123 --> 07:34.623
Splash! Splash! Splash!

07:36.960 --> 07:39.461
Now you're sure you haven't
been to China?

07:39.546 --> 07:40.796
There's no shame in it.

07:40.880 --> 07:41.964
No. I told you.

07:42.048 --> 07:44.883
A mosquito came out
of my Laffy Meal
and bit me!

07:44.968 --> 07:46.760
What's wrong
with him, Doctor?

07:46.845 --> 07:49.429
It can't be mange.
I just had him dipped.

07:49.514 --> 07:52.975
Your son is exhibiting
classic symptoms
of panda virus.

07:53.059 --> 07:54.726
Here. Take a look.

07:56.479 --> 07:59.481
I knew it was serious
when he said he didn't
want ice cream.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.983
I did want ice cream.

08:01.067 --> 08:02.484
Well, your father
ate it all!

08:02.569 --> 08:05.779
Now don't worry.
These pills will
take care of everything.

08:05.864 --> 08:09.408
But for a week,
Bart will be highly
infectious to others.

08:10.743 --> 08:15.664
Contagious? Outrageous!
I got me some
teachers to lick.

08:17.208 --> 08:20.002
Well,
I don't know about that.
But don't worry.

08:20.086 --> 08:22.296
While you're infectious,
you will lead

08:22.380 --> 08:25.674
a normal life full of
normal social interaction.

08:25.967 --> 08:28.385
I don't like how many times
you said "normal. "

08:28.469 --> 08:30.179
You'll be living
in this bubble.

08:30.263 --> 08:33.347
It's clear plastic
so the world can see
how normal you are.

08:39.147 --> 08:40.397
Help me!

08:41.524 --> 08:45.235
You'll get
the hang of it, honey.
Today's just a little gusty.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.362
Everyone's staring at me.

08:47.447 --> 08:48.614
Ha-ha!

08:52.452 --> 08:54.953
Ha-ha!

09:07.383 --> 09:09.301
This place is amazing.

09:09.719 --> 09:12.054
Kiosks,
outdoor study groups.

09:12.889 --> 09:14.431
Lisa,
where have you been?

09:14.515 --> 09:15.807
In heaven.

09:17.101 --> 09:20.145
I love her.
She's a total free spirit.

09:20.230 --> 09:22.564
She'd have to be
where she lives.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.983
That place had
a Manson Family vibe.

09:25.068 --> 09:28.153
Yeah, well,
I live in a dorm
without a DSL line.

09:28.238 --> 09:29.446
Freaky.

09:32.075 --> 09:34.409
I think the soup's
a little hot.

09:38.706 --> 09:40.374
Bart, don't slurp
your soup.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.000
My bubble, my rules.

09:43.586 --> 09:46.338
That's it, boy!
It's time for your bath!

09:52.053 --> 09:53.595
Now go to bed.

09:55.181 --> 09:58.141
That is called parenting.
I'm going to Moe's.

10:04.691 --> 10:08.360
Test. Test. Roses are red.
April is the cruelest month.

10:08.444 --> 10:10.028
Cruelest month.

10:10.571 --> 10:13.782
Now open your minds
for the Coltrane
of the quatrain,

10:13.866 --> 10:16.618
the Tony Danza
of the A-B stanza.

10:16.869 --> 10:19.288
I give you the former
poet laureate of

10:19.372 --> 10:22.874
the United States,
Mr. Robert Pinsky.

10:24.043 --> 10:26.336
Tonight I'll be reading
from a copy of my book

10:26.421 --> 10:29.339
I just checked out
at Atherton Library!

10:29.632 --> 10:30.882
I study there!

10:32.093 --> 10:33.927
Say another building!

10:34.053 --> 10:35.762
That's it, Pinsky.

10:36.014 --> 10:38.265
You've got them
right where you want them.

10:38.349 --> 10:40.851
"Slow dulcimer,
gavotte and bow in autumn"

10:42.061 --> 10:44.688
He's reading
Impossible to Tell.

10:44.772 --> 10:47.316
"Basho and his friends
go out to view the moon

10:47.400 --> 10:50.152
"In summer,
gasoline rainbow
in the gutter

10:50.236 --> 10:52.946
"The secret courtesy
that courses like ichor

10:53.031 --> 10:56.366
"Through the old form of
the rude, full-scale joke"

10:57.327 --> 10:59.578
I'm in a coffee house
listening to poetry.

10:59.662 --> 11:02.414
There's a cat on a table
and no one seems to care.

11:02.498 --> 11:05.334
This is the single
greatest day of my life!

11:05.418 --> 11:07.878
"Impossible to
tell in writing.

11:08.212 --> 11:11.256
"Basho, he named himself,
'Banana tree. "'

11:11.341 --> 11:12.674
Basho!

11:12.759 --> 11:14.176
Banana tree!

11:17.638 --> 11:20.766
Good night, Bart.
Good night, Lisa.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.851
Good night, Maggie.

11:24.145 --> 11:26.355
Cherish these moments,
Homer.

11:27.315 --> 11:29.316
So I'm walking by
the Oval Office.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.486
And I hear the President,
"Pinsky, where's my poem?"

11:32.570 --> 11:34.404
Well, I thought it wasn't
due till Tuesday.

11:34.489 --> 11:39.034
So I make one up.
I am just pulling
stuff out of my ass.

11:39.202 --> 11:41.453
And when I'm done,
the President says,

11:41.579 --> 11:43.705
"Pinsky,
you've done it again. "

11:43.790 --> 11:45.123
Ka-ching!

11:45.208 --> 11:49.544
Oh, my God!
My social studies project
is due tomorrow morning!

11:51.756 --> 11:53.715
Did she put in
for the pizza?

11:55.051 --> 11:57.344
Gotta finish.
Gotta finish.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.679
Am I using too much glue?

11:59.764 --> 12:03.475
You won't eat our meat
but you glue with our feet.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.905
Well, it's still
the best thing
in this class.

12:21.494 --> 12:22.702
A- minus.

12:24.122 --> 12:27.374
Lisa Simpson,
master of the double life.

12:32.004 --> 12:34.840
You're like my mommy
after a box of wine.

12:37.301 --> 12:38.427
Give me your lunch money!

12:38.511 --> 12:40.011
But it's after lunch.

12:40.096 --> 12:41.638
It's just an expression.

12:41.722 --> 12:45.475
Like "kick your
butt" could involve
no kicking whatsoever.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.894
Never fear,
the sphere is here!

12:50.606 --> 12:54.192
That's it, Simpson.
I'm gonna kick you
right in the ball.

13:02.201 --> 13:04.453
When nerds are in trouble,
I am not slow.

13:04.537 --> 13:07.247
It's spin, spin, spin,
and away I go!

13:08.958 --> 13:11.001
Once he's gone,
they'll kill us!

13:32.899 --> 13:35.317
That young adult
looks like Lisa.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.487
That young adult is Lisa!

13:38.654 --> 13:40.906
She's up to
something private!

13:41.199 --> 13:42.949
Let's go spy on her!

13:44.243 --> 13:46.912
I'll get you down.
Bite these pencils.

13:54.879 --> 13:56.922
This is the life
we chose.

13:59.550 --> 14:01.426
Huh? Where is everybody?

14:01.511 --> 14:05.305
Passive Analysis
of Visual Iconography.

14:05.515 --> 14:06.681
Everyone takes it.

14:06.766 --> 14:09.935
All you do is watch
Itchy & Scratchy cartoons.

14:11.354 --> 14:12.729
After her!

14:16.150 --> 14:18.193
I feel like
Harriet the spy.

14:21.447 --> 14:26.952
Now the classic
Itchy & Scratchy,
episode DAB-FO6.

14:27.161 --> 14:28.912
"Butter Off Dead. "

14:36.295 --> 14:38.588
Good morrow to thee,
neighbor.

15:12.873 --> 15:14.416
Okay.
Freeze there.

15:15.501 --> 15:17.586
So what does
this cartoon "mean"?

15:17.670 --> 15:20.046
It shows how the depletion
of our natural resources

15:20.131 --> 15:22.382
has pitted our small farmers
against each other.

15:22.466 --> 15:25.969
Yes.
And birds go "tweet. "
What else?

15:28.014 --> 15:31.141
Hey, Mister!
Put the cartoon back on!

15:31.225 --> 15:34.686
I'm sorry, boys.
We don't allow
children in this class.

15:35.938 --> 15:38.398
What about Lisa?
She's only eight!

15:43.821 --> 15:45.780
Lisa, did you lie to us?

15:46.282 --> 15:48.074
I just wanted to belong!

15:48.159 --> 15:50.952
For once I felt I was
with intellectual equals.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.164
I can't believe
I cheated off
an eight-year-old.

15:54.248 --> 15:57.042
I guess we won't be
biking through Italy.

16:01.005 --> 16:02.380
She's worse than
that 80-year-old

16:02.465 --> 16:03.923
who pretended
to be a freshman.

16:04.008 --> 16:06.968
I just wanted
a place to sit down.

16:09.889 --> 16:13.558
What the...
You earned how many credits
without our permission?

16:13.643 --> 16:15.685
Sixteen.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.396
College is no place
for a young girl,

16:18.481 --> 16:23.610
with those quadrangles
and study carrels
and syllabi, and...

16:23.694 --> 16:26.404
Doogie Howser
went to college
when he was my age.

16:26.489 --> 16:28.156
Against my wishes!

16:28.240 --> 16:30.492
But the atmosphere there
was so stimulating.

16:30.576 --> 16:33.244
It was a bustling
marketplace of ideas.

16:33.329 --> 16:35.372
Oh.
And this kitchen isn't?

16:35.456 --> 16:36.498
Well...

16:36.582 --> 16:39.334
I put those Cathys
on the fridge for you.

16:39.418 --> 16:42.170
I don't even like them.
They've gotten so smutty.

16:42.254 --> 16:46.383
Sure. When a man
does it, it's smutty.
But if a woman did it...

16:46.467 --> 16:48.551
Homer,
Cathy is a woman.

16:48.636 --> 16:50.095
Oh, come on...

16:52.014 --> 16:53.139
You're right.

16:59.855 --> 17:01.231
What are you guys doing?

17:01.315 --> 17:03.024
We're gonna
roll down the hill.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.401
Can I come with you?

17:04.527 --> 17:05.859
I don't know.

17:05.944 --> 17:08.905
Are you sure you're not
too "college" for us?

17:09.531 --> 17:12.617
Yeah. Sorry we
can't be more "college!"

17:16.122 --> 17:18.873
Hey, Einstein.
What's a million
plus a million?

17:18.958 --> 17:20.625
Two million.
So?

17:23.546 --> 17:25.213
Don't let them
get to you, lass.

17:25.297 --> 17:27.507
I'm too good for
this place, too.

17:27.590 --> 17:29.342
Now run home
to your shack.

17:29.427 --> 17:30.510
I live in a house.

17:30.594 --> 17:33.638
Well, la-dee-da,
college girl!

17:33.723 --> 17:36.558
Well, I guess you're
too good for me, too!

17:37.893 --> 17:38.935
Oh, look at...

17:48.070 --> 17:49.154
What are you doing?

17:49.238 --> 17:51.614
I was trying to throw
Bart over the roof

17:51.699 --> 17:53.992
and he got stuck
in this tree.

17:56.454 --> 17:58.079
Marge,
where's my pellet gun?

17:58.164 --> 17:59.956
In the tree!
Right.

18:04.462 --> 18:07.255
Oh, no!
Not the good cheek!

18:15.848 --> 18:18.266
Poor, Bart.
I know just how you feel.

18:18.350 --> 18:20.602
Isolated, alone,
cut off from everyone.

18:20.686 --> 18:21.686
Are you kidding?

18:21.771 --> 18:24.063
This little baby has made me
more popular than ever.

18:24.148 --> 18:25.774
Hey, Bubble Bart!
Looking good.

18:25.858 --> 18:26.858
Call me!

18:26.942 --> 18:29.235
The bubble makes everything
shimmer and glow.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.613
You can't believe
what that sunset
looks like to me.

18:31.697 --> 18:34.657
That's not a sunset.
That's a bird on fire.

18:35.659 --> 18:37.452
To-may-to, to-mah-to.

18:37.620 --> 18:39.829
I wish I had
someplace to
call my own.

18:39.914 --> 18:42.040
No one wants me
around anymore.

18:43.083 --> 18:46.085
I know a way
you can win back
the kids at school.

18:46.170 --> 18:48.463
Really?
That's wonderful.
But how?

18:48.547 --> 18:50.632
All you gotta do
is play a prank
on the principal.

18:50.716 --> 18:54.219
Well, I can't do it tomorrow.
There's an assembly
in his honor.

18:55.387 --> 18:58.389
We've got
a little planning to do.
Step into my office.

18:58.474 --> 19:00.475
Ew! Bart!
It wasn't me.

19:02.019 --> 19:05.688
In recognition
of your 20 years
as interim principal,

19:05.773 --> 19:09.734
I hereby dedicate
the Seymour Skinner
parking annex.

19:14.907 --> 19:17.200
Did they have to guess
the date of my death?

19:17.284 --> 19:20.078
Can't you be
a team player
just once?

19:21.705 --> 19:23.957
When I was
starting out, they said,

19:24.041 --> 19:27.085
"You're good.
But are you
'plaque' good?"

19:27.711 --> 19:31.631
Well, today I can say,
"Yes, I am. "

19:33.676 --> 19:35.885
Three, two, one...

19:35.970 --> 19:37.011
Thank you.

19:37.096 --> 19:41.057
I will now take
pre-approved questions
from honor roll students.

19:41.684 --> 19:45.979
Yeah, I got a question!
How dare you wear white?

19:46.063 --> 19:48.189
I hear
what you do at night.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.524
Security!

19:50.401 --> 19:51.860
Get your hands off of me.
Why...

19:51.944 --> 19:53.903
Martin Prince,
Daily Fourth Gradian.

19:53.988 --> 19:56.865
How about a picture of you
and the cake for
our society page?

19:56.949 --> 19:58.783
Now normally
I wouldn't go near

19:58.868 --> 20:01.035
a giant chocolate cake
in my dress polyester.

20:01.120 --> 20:05.290
But with Bart Simpson
safely encapsulated,
I'd be delighted to pose.

20:15.134 --> 20:19.012
Look, up there! It's Lisa!
And she's winning us back!

20:44.496 --> 20:47.749
I've been taken down a peg.
A whole peg!

20:48.042 --> 20:52.837
Lisa, Lisa,
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa!

20:53.005 --> 20:54.130
Good going, Lise.

20:54.214 --> 20:57.216
And it sure is great
to be out of that bubble.

20:57.676 --> 21:00.678
It sure is sunny.
Was the air
always this fresh?

21:00.763 --> 21:03.348
I'm just gonna
hang out in this vent!

21:04.600 --> 21:07.352
Does this thing
suck or blow?

21:07.853 --> 21:09.854
Suck!

21:10.305 --> 21:16.531
