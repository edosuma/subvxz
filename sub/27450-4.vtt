33:40.033 --> 33:41.800

33:52.934 --> 33:55.233
Congratulations, Derik.

33:52.934 --> 33:55.233
You are a Titan.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.500
-Yeah.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.500
-How does that feel?

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
It's better than any fight

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
I've ever won.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.300
This feels so amazing,

33:58.700 --> 34:01.300
just because

34:01.400 --> 34:03.533
how much that course

34:01.400 --> 34:03.533
really did test you.

34:03.633 --> 34:06.567
That boulder was, whoa,

You've been amazing tonight.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.100

-to the Battle of the Titans.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.734
You're probably wondering how

34:20.266 --> 34:23.734
we crown our ultimate winners.

34:23.834 --> 34:25.266
Well, here's how

34:23.834 --> 34:25.266
it's gonna work.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.567
At the end of the season,

34:25.367 --> 34:27.567
all the Titans will return

34:27.667 --> 34:29.367
for the epic

34:27.667 --> 34:29.367
Battle of the Titans.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.200
<i>And when the last battle</i>

34:31.300 --> 34:34.233
<i>one man and one woman</i>

34:31.300 --> 34:34.233
<i>will each become</i>

<i>undisputed Titan Champions.</i>

34:36.600 --> 34:39.233
Now, the horse whisperer,

34:36.600 --> 34:39.233
Christiana Rugloski,

34:39.333 --> 34:41.633
and the preschool teacher,

34:39.333 --> 34:41.633
Nichole Root,

34:41.734 --> 34:43.233
face off on Mount Olympus.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.133
They're coming off

34:43.333 --> 34:45.133

34:45.233 --> 34:47.533

38:52.667 --> 38:54.934
[Liam]<i> Saw a little smile</i>

38:52.667 --> 38:54.934
<i>on her face right there.</i>

38:55.033 --> 38:56.700
[Alex]<i> She knows she</i>

38:55.033 --> 38:56.700
<i>did something clever.</i>

38:56.800 --> 38:59.100
<i>And Nichole is making</i>

38:56.800 --> 38:59.100
<i>her way down the mountain.</i>

38:59.200 --> 39:01.767
[Liam]<i> Nichole's only</i>

38:59.200 --> 39:01.767
<i>five feet tall.</i>

39:01.867 --> 39:03.700
<i>Look at this.</i>

39:01.867 --> 39:03.700
<i>Leaping up and over</i>

39:03.800 --> 39:05.700
<i>that last seven foot wall.</i>

39:05.800 --> 39:07.100
Let's go, Nichole.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.767
[Alex]<i> Liam, this is why</i>

39:07.200 --> 39:09.767
<i>you don't celebrate early.</i>

39:09.867 --> 39:12.600
<i>Nichole Root</i>

39:09.867 --> 39:12.600
<i>is back in the race.</i>

39:12.700 --> 39:14.734
<i>Christiana's</i>

39:12.700 --> 39:14.734
<i>still moving slowly.</i>

39:14.834 --> 39:16.600
[Liam]<i> Nichole still</i>

39:14.834 --> 39:16.600
<i>has a shot here,</i>

39:16.700 --> 39:19.000
<i>but at 125 pounds,</i>

39:16.700 --> 39:19.000
<i>you got to wonder,</i>

39:19.100 --> 39:21.934
<i>how is she gonna handle</i>

39:19.100 --> 39:21.934
<i>that 200-pound ball and chain?</i>

39:22.033 --> 39:23.433
[grunts]

39:23.533 --> 39:27.400
[Alex]<i> Oh, Nichole Root</i>

39:23.533 --> 39:27.400
<i>is dragging that boulder!</i>

39:27.500 --> 39:30.967
<i>-I cannot believe this, Liam!</i>

39:27.500 --> 39:30.967
-Oh, my God!

39:31.066 --> 39:33.633
[Alex]<i> Christiana was</i>

39:31.066 --> 39:33.633
<i>smiling on her way down,</i>

39:33.734 --> 39:34.734
<i>hands in the air!</i>

39:34.834 --> 39:36.667
<i>Nichole Root said,</i>

39:34.834 --> 39:36.667
<i>"To heck with that!</i>

39:36.767 --> 39:39.533
"I am going to catch up

39:36.767 --> 39:39.533
right here, right now.

39:39.633 --> 39:40.900
I want to be a Titan."

39:41.000 --> 39:42.967
<i>She's ready</i>

39:41.000 --> 39:42.967
<i>to match Christiana</i>

39:43.066 --> 39:44.500
<i>blow for blow at the tomb!</i>

39:44.600 --> 39:47.033
[dramatic music]

39:47.133 --> 39:50.900
[Liam]<i> And look at that!</i>

39:47.133 --> 39:50.900
<i>Nichole cracked through first.</i>

39:51.000 --> 39:53.300
<i>This is anyone's race.</i>

39:53.400 --> 39:55.266
[Alex]<i> Christiana</i>

39:53.400 --> 39:55.266
<i>opens the tomb!</i>

39:55.367 --> 39:57.133
<i>Nichole's right behind her!</i>

39:57.233 --> 39:59.467
<i>Will she be able</i>

39:57.233 --> 39:59.467
<i>to mount a comeback?</i>

39:59.567 --> 40:02.800
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

39:59.567 --> 40:02.800
<i>Christiana has the key.</i>

40:04.300 --> 40:06.867
<i>-Christiana locks it in.</i>

40:04.300 --> 40:06.867
-Done!

40:06.967 --> 40:11.433
<i>And Christiana Rugloski</i>

40:06.967 --> 40:11.433
<i>is a Titan!</i>

40:11.533 --> 40:13.166
[dramatic music]

40:13.266 --> 40:15.533
<i>I cannot believe</i>

40:13.266 --> 40:15.533
<i>what we just saw.</i>

40:15.633 --> 40:18.700
Congratulations.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.133
Thanks.

40:20.233 --> 40:22.266
[Alex]<i> Christiana pulled ahead</i>

40:20.233 --> 40:22.266
<i>on the Rolling Ascent,</i>

40:22.367 --> 40:24.166
<i>and thought she had</i>

40:22.367 --> 40:24.166
<i>an easy lead</i>

40:24.266 --> 40:25.500
<i>coming down the mountain.</i>

40:25.600 --> 40:28.433
<i>But at the Ball and Chain,</i>

40:25.600 --> 40:28.433
<i>the preschool teacher</i>

40:28.533 --> 40:32.400
<i>gave us a lesson in raw power</i>

40:28.533 --> 40:32.400
<i>and kept on Christiana's hees</i>

40:32.500 --> 40:33.767
<i>all the way to the finish.</i>

40:33.867 --> 40:35.867
[Liam]<i> That little girl</i>

40:33.867 --> 40:35.867
<i>who was never allowed</i>

40:35.967 --> 40:39.667
<i>to play sports as a kid</i>

40:35.967 --> 40:39.667
<i>grew up to be a Titan.</i>

40:39.767 --> 40:41.967
Derik and Christiana did it.

40:42.066 --> 40:44.633
They came. They fought.

40:42.066 --> 40:44.633
They conquered.

40:44.734 --> 40:47.967
They earned the right

40:44.734 --> 40:47.967
to be called Titans.

40:48.066 --> 40:50.467
[dramatic music]

40:50.567 --> 40:52.300
[Liam]<i> So the lawyer,</i>

40:50.567 --> 40:52.300
<i>Derik Scott,</i>

40:52.400 --> 40:55.867
<i>and Christiana Rugloski</i>

40:52.400 --> 40:55.867
<i>are our newest Titans.</i>

40:55.967 --> 40:58.100
<i>Next week,</i>

40:55.967 --> 40:58.100
<i>we'll find two more,</i>

40:58.200 --> 41:01.500
<i>and in just a few weeks,</i>

40:58.200 --> 41:01.500
<i>all 16 will be heading</i>

41:01.600 --> 41:02.767
<i>to our Battle of the Titans.</i>

41:02.867 --> 41:06.166
<i>We'll see you next week</i>

41:02.867 --> 41:06.166
<i>on</i> The Titan Games.
