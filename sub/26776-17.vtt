I did not think that
they were gonna do that.

21:15.073 --> 21:16.675
Aye!

21:18.010 --> 21:20.545
- This is so much better
with real lasers!

21:20.612 --> 21:22.948
- Right?
- Hey wait, cease fire.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.616
Cease fire.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.085
- What?

21:27.152 --> 21:28.553
- How long has Ray been gone?

21:28.620 --> 21:30.555
- About a week.
- Yep.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.957
- Should we be worried?

21:32.024 --> 21:34.359
- He'll be fine,
he's indestructible.

21:34.426 --> 21:35.394
Resume fire!

21:35.460 --> 21:36.428
- Hey!
- Hey!

21:36.495 --> 21:39.064
Come on! You can't just--

21:39.131 --> 21:40.132
stop guarding!

21:40.198 --> 21:41.299
- You stop guarding!

21:41.366 --> 21:43.635
- Tunnel punch!

21:51.543 --> 21:53.879
I'm oooooooohhhkaaaaay!

21:56.214 --> 21:58.050
And so is my painting!

21:59.384 --> 22:00.952
Ahhh!
