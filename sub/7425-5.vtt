<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast...

00:02.325 --> 00:03.592
<i>I was part of</i>
<i>a highly classified</i>

00:03.660 --> 00:05.060

00:08.297 --> 00:10.365
Vincent!

00:10.432 --> 00:12.400
Don't shoot!
She's my daughter.

00:18.406 --> 00:20.741
<i>There are</i>
<i>more of them out there.</i>

00:20.809 --> 00:25.245
Vincent, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

00:25.313 --> 00:27.181
I know.

00:27.248 --> 00:29.449
Does this mean that
you remember all of this?

00:29.484 --> 00:30.751
Well, I remember facts,

00:30.819 --> 00:31.940
I just don't have any memory

00:31.986 --> 00:34.020
of personal experiences.

00:34.088 --> 00:35.855
Makes me a better soldier.

00:35.923 --> 00:37.724
Soldier for what?

00:39.493 --> 00:41.561
'Cause that's what
we're doing here, right?

00:41.628 --> 00:43.763
You got a list of names,

00:43.831 --> 00:46.700
and then I eliminate them,
one by one.

00:46.767 --> 00:48.901
Just trying
to keep people safe, remember?

00:48.968 --> 00:50.435
Look, let's drop the pretense.

00:50.503 --> 00:53.438
We both know that sat phone
isn't for a shipwreck.

00:53.506 --> 00:55.107
Someone's got you
hunting beasts.

00:55.175 --> 00:57.076
I need to get through your list

00:57.143 --> 00:58.310
as soon as possible.

00:58.377 --> 00:59.611
What's going on here?

00:59.679 --> 01:01.279
Why the sudden rush?
What happened?

01:01.347 --> 01:03.387
Is this something
to do with Catherine?

01:05.650 --> 01:07.618
Yeah.

<i>I haven't been</i>
<i>able to find him yet,</i>

02:03.339 --> 02:04.973
which, to be honest,
is a little odd, but...

02:05.040 --> 02:07.175
I'm not giving up.

02:07.243 --> 02:08.508
Odd? What do you mean, odd?

02:08.577 --> 02:10.377
Well, I don't know, I mean,

02:10.445 --> 02:12.480
obviously, I've looked for
a few birth fathers as an ADA,

02:12.547 --> 02:14.482
and the records aren't always
easy to unseal.

02:14.549 --> 02:17.184
But you're
having problems with mine?

02:17.252 --> 02:19.052
Frankly, yeah...
but don't worry,

02:19.120 --> 02:20.788
I'll keep digging.

02:20.855 --> 02:23.624
Gabe, thank you so much for
helping me out with this.

02:23.692 --> 02:24.658
Hey, it's no problem.

02:24.725 --> 02:26.993
Wait, are you listening to...?

02:27.060 --> 02:28.861
â™ªOkay, it's not what you think.

02:28.929 --> 02:30.664
I have a ten-year high school
reunion tomorrow,

02:30.731 --> 02:32.399
and I'm having
some friends over, so...

02:32.466 --> 02:33.587
just trying to set the mood.

02:33.634 --> 02:34.567
Yeah?

02:34.635 --> 02:35.669
Good for you.

02:35.736 --> 02:37.069
It's about time you started

02:37.137 --> 02:39.806
focusing on yourself
for a change instead...

02:39.873 --> 02:42.474
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to imply that...

02:42.542 --> 02:44.142
No, no, it's okay, you're right.

02:44.210 --> 02:45.678
It's about time.

02:45.745 --> 02:47.680
And I'm actually really
looking forward to it,

02:47.747 --> 02:50.482
except for the low-rise jeans
and crop tops.

02:50.550 --> 02:53.251
Ah, come on, I'm sure
you look great in them.

02:54.821 --> 02:56.461
The mayor's on the phone.
He sounds upset.

02:56.488 --> 02:57.988
Upset?
Is there a problem?

02:58.056 --> 03:01.526
If there is, it is my problem,
not yours, okay?

03:01.593 --> 03:04.028
You just get in your time
machine and have fun.

03:04.095 --> 03:05.029
Let go.

03:05.096 --> 03:06.497
Okay. Trying.

03:10.902 --> 03:12.602
Oh, crap.

03:19.276 --> 03:20.910
I scare you?
Yes.

03:20.978 --> 03:23.046
You ever heard
of a front door?

03:23.113 --> 03:24.448
Yeah, about that--
I wasn't sure

03:24.515 --> 03:27.917
if I was actually allowed
to use it or not.

03:27.985 --> 03:30.285
I mean, am I?
It depends. But...

03:30.354 --> 03:31.854
Listen...

03:31.921 --> 03:32.855
I know that
I shouldn't just

03:32.922 --> 03:34.357
barge in on you like this,

03:34.424 --> 03:35.358
but I had to see you, okay?

03:35.425 --> 03:37.125
And I was
just hoping maybe

03:37.193 --> 03:40.062
we could pick up
where we left off.

03:40.129 --> 03:42.231
Maybe help each other
figure out who we really are

03:42.298 --> 03:43.466
and I don't know,

03:43.533 --> 03:45.367
maybe trigger
a few more memories...

03:45.434 --> 03:47.469
I'm sorry,
normally, I'm all for

03:47.536 --> 03:49.437
getting your memories back,
for both our sake.

03:49.505 --> 03:53.074
But right now,
no memories, no missions,

03:53.141 --> 03:54.108
I am taking the night off.

03:54.176 --> 03:55.543
So you're kicking me out?

03:55.611 --> 03:57.779
Yes... yes, I am.

03:57.847 --> 03:59.481
But don't take
it personally.

03:59.548 --> 04:00.881
I'm just having a
pre-reunion party here--

04:00.948 --> 04:02.449
girls only, no beasts.

04:02.517 --> 04:03.917
Oh...
Just some "me" time, you know?

04:03.985 --> 04:05.753
It's healthy.
You understand.

04:05.820 --> 04:07.621
Actually, I don't understand...

04:07.689 --> 04:09.390
Well, I do.
Oh.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.893
And you will, too,
someday... I hope.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.461
Vincent, you're
getting better,

04:14.529 --> 04:16.928
we're getting better
and that's terrific.

04:16.997 --> 04:19.464
But if we're really going to
figure out who we are together,

04:19.533 --> 04:21.166
we have to make sure
we don't forget

04:21.233 --> 04:22.735
who we are separately
along the way, too.

04:24.137 --> 04:26.806
And they're here.
Mm-hmm.

04:26.874 --> 04:28.307
So why don't you
go and talk to JT?

04:28.375 --> 04:30.109
Trigger some memories with him.
Oh, come on...

04:30.176 --> 04:31.737
Don't sprain your ankle
on the way down.

04:31.745 --> 04:32.944
Coming!

04:38.885 --> 04:40.351
I realize that, Your Honor,

04:40.420 --> 04:43.087
and I assure you
I am on top of it.

04:43.155 --> 04:45.624
You know, I already have
my best detective on it.

04:45.691 --> 04:48.159
Absolutely.

04:48.227 --> 04:49.660
I will keep you...

04:49.728 --> 04:52.430
...posted.

04:52.497 --> 04:54.164
Your "best detective"
wants a raise.

04:54.232 --> 04:56.199
Solve this problem
and we'll talk.

04:56.267 --> 04:57.435
Well, it sounds like
the problem is

04:57.502 --> 04:59.036
the mayor just tore you
a new one,

04:59.103 --> 05:00.438
and I'm lousy
with a needle and thread.

05:00.505 --> 05:03.040
He wants answers
to all the unsolved cases

05:03.107 --> 05:04.507
from when Joe was in charge.

05:04.575 --> 05:07.877
I was assigned here
to clean up his mess.

05:10.213 --> 05:11.681
Joe's mess.

05:11.749 --> 05:12.715
Nice.

05:12.783 --> 05:13.950
Is that how you win friends

05:14.017 --> 05:15.117
and influence people?

05:15.185 --> 05:16.285
I'm sorry.

05:16.353 --> 05:18.888
That was a poor choice
of words.

05:18.956 --> 05:21.857
Look, those cases involved
Vincent and Muirfield.

05:21.925 --> 05:25.293
Now we've got Zhao's murder
to explain, Agent Tucker...

05:25.361 --> 05:26.328
They're all beast-related
incidents.

05:26.395 --> 05:28.129
How the hell do we explain them?

05:28.197 --> 05:30.466
You see the problem?
Like it or not,

05:30.533 --> 05:32.233
both of our necks are
on the line here.

05:32.301 --> 05:34.235
So is Catherine's.

05:34.303 --> 05:37.037
And she has such
a pretty little neck, too.

05:38.874 --> 05:40.174
Get out.

05:40.241 --> 05:41.241
Okay, okay.

05:41.309 --> 05:43.177
Geez.

05:53.588 --> 05:54.868
You actually lived in an ashram?

05:54.922 --> 05:56.255
Oh, my God, it was the best

05:56.323 --> 05:57.390
spiritual experience
of my life.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.693
Oh, spiritual, right.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.029
While I am busting my ass
proving myself as a journalist,

06:03.097 --> 06:05.431
you are practicing tantric
sex in the Himalayas.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.101
You're just jealous.
Oh, never have sex.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.168
Sex results in lots of
drooling little creatures

06:10.236 --> 06:11.937
running around,
who want things from you.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.373
And yet you are
having your third?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.509
Don't remind me.
By the way, it is killing me

06:16.576 --> 06:18.043
that you're standing here
with the same waistline

06:18.111 --> 06:20.078
you had in tenth grade.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.346
You know, seriously,
Cat, you haven't changed.

06:21.414 --> 06:23.448
No, Little Miss
Honor Roll here

06:23.517 --> 06:25.216
is a bad-ass cop.

06:25.283 --> 06:27.886
Yeah, well, she always
had a taste for danger.

06:27.953 --> 06:29.754
Or, at least,
dangerous guys.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.389
What?
Oh, please!

06:31.456 --> 06:32.757
Scott Arness?

06:32.825 --> 06:33.958
Bobby Simpson?

06:34.026 --> 06:35.860
Phil "The Snake" Parker?

06:35.928 --> 06:37.795
Ugh.
Isn't he in rehab?

06:37.863 --> 06:39.964
They probably all are.
Or in jail.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.197
Okay, you guys
are just jealous 'cause

06:41.265 --> 06:43.099
at least they were cute.

06:43.167 --> 06:44.367
Yeah, but, you know,

06:44.435 --> 06:45.636
you did always
pick the projects,

06:45.703 --> 06:47.303
"the broken wings."

06:47.371 --> 06:49.706
Shower 'em with love,
and then try to save them.

06:49.774 --> 06:50.774
Yeah. Never works.

06:50.842 --> 06:52.075
You know what?

06:52.143 --> 06:55.278
That was then,
this is now, right?

06:55.346 --> 06:57.246
Right.

06:57.313 --> 07:00.249
So, do you have anyone
special in your life now, Cat?

07:10.694 --> 07:12.294
All right, good-bye.
Bye.

07:12.362 --> 07:13.494
Let's meet in front of
the school tomorrow night.

07:13.563 --> 07:14.495
Yes.
Okay.

07:14.564 --> 07:15.797
All right.
Bye, guys.

07:15.831 --> 07:17.231
Unless I pop
this baby out first today.

07:17.299 --> 07:18.833
Oh, uhuh,  purse.

07:18.901 --> 07:20.234
It's in my bedroom.
Bye!

07:20.302 --> 07:21.803
Bye, guys.
Bye.

07:29.343 --> 07:31.344
I told you to
stop doing that.

07:33.347 --> 07:35.348
Scream and I'll
rip your throat out.

07:35.416 --> 07:37.084
Who is he?
What's his name?

07:37.151 --> 07:39.753
Who?
Don't play with me, bitch.

07:39.854 --> 07:41.689
I can smell that
beast all over you.

07:41.756 --> 07:44.157
Bet that would nice, huh?

07:44.225 --> 07:46.593
To be all over you.

07:46.660 --> 07:49.862
You tell me where he is
and I'll kill you quick.

07:49.930 --> 07:50.964
Cat?

08:05.645 --> 08:06.645
Cat!

08:18.099 --> 08:22.099
<font color=#00FF00>â™ª Beauty and the Beast 2x05 â™ª</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Reunion</font>
Original Air Date on November 4, 2013

== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

08:27.101 --> 08:30.866
No. I didn't get
a really good look at him,

08:30.867 --> 08:33.635
but what I did see
was pretty creepy.

08:33.703 --> 08:35.537
Creepy, how?
Can you be more specific?

08:35.605 --> 08:38.907
I don't know; I'm not sure.

08:38.975 --> 08:42.409
I mean, Cat, you saw him.

08:42.477 --> 08:45.379
There was something
really weird about his eyes.

08:45.447 --> 08:49.584
I mean, they looked like
they were... glowing.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.821
They were, I'm telling you.

08:53.889 --> 08:55.689
Right?

08:55.756 --> 08:57.491
I don't know.

08:57.558 --> 08:58.825
I don't know what I saw.

08:58.893 --> 09:00.360
It all happened so fast.

09:00.427 --> 09:01.695
Okay, so then
what happened?

09:01.762 --> 09:03.096
I fired off
a couple rounds,

09:03.163 --> 09:04.898
and the perp took off
out the window.

09:04.966 --> 09:06.933
You mean he went
through the window, Cat.

09:07.001 --> 09:08.702
He jumped out.
Onto the street.

09:08.769 --> 09:10.529
Jumped? Ma'am, we're on
the fifth floor here.

09:10.571 --> 09:12.838
I know.
He must've used the fire escape.

09:12.906 --> 09:14.607
No, he didn't-- he jumped.

09:14.674 --> 09:17.376
Cat, I know you saw that.

09:17.443 --> 09:19.177
I was just attacked, Beth.

09:19.278 --> 09:21.246
I don't know what I saw.

09:21.314 --> 09:22.615
Neither of us do,
really.

09:22.682 --> 09:24.683
No, I do.

09:24.751 --> 09:26.852
Let's walk it
through again.

09:28.554 --> 09:29.521
Okay.

09:33.626 --> 09:34.559
Cat.

09:36.028 --> 09:38.596
What are the
uniforms doing here?

09:38.664 --> 09:40.031
My friend called 911.

09:40.098 --> 09:41.098
Yeah.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.700
Did she see anything?

09:42.768 --> 09:44.301
She told them that she did,

09:44.369 --> 09:45.302
and they don't believe her.

09:45.370 --> 09:47.038
That's the good news.

09:47.105 --> 09:50.241
The bad news is that she works
for National Metro News.

09:50.308 --> 09:52.643
Great. That's just
what we need right now.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.278
Are you all right?

09:54.346 --> 09:56.647
Define "All right."

09:56.714 --> 09:58.082
Yes, I'm fine.

09:58.150 --> 09:59.750
We just need to warn Vincent
as soon as possible.

09:59.817 --> 10:01.751
Whoa, whoa, wait, you just
got attacked in your bedroom

10:01.818 --> 10:03.420
and you're
worried about Vincent?

10:03.487 --> 10:04.887
Yes, because there is
another beast out there

10:04.955 --> 10:06.256
who's trying to kill him.

10:06.323 --> 10:08.391
I'll be back.
Wait-- Catherine,

10:08.459 --> 10:10.126
if Vincent hears
you were attacked,

10:10.194 --> 10:12.462
he won't think,
he'll just take off

10:12.530 --> 10:14.164
without having any idea
who he's up against.

10:14.231 --> 10:16.151
It's a beast, Gabe--
fangs, claws, bad attitude--

10:16.166 --> 10:17.466
what else does he need?

10:17.534 --> 10:18.600
Ye, but the last beast

10:18.668 --> 10:19.668
Vincent went after
half-cocked

10:19.735 --> 10:21.002
almost got him
killed, remember?

10:21.071 --> 10:22.904
And since we don't know
what this beast

10:22.972 --> 10:24.173
is capable of either,
let's at least try

10:24.240 --> 10:25.974
and figure out
who he is first.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.477
Okay, I'll see if he
left a business card somewhere.

10:31.281 --> 10:33.448
Wait. Maybe he left
something better.

10:34.749 --> 10:35.983
Here.

10:36.051 --> 10:38.186
DNA.   Good.

10:38.253 --> 10:39.687
Maybe JT can analyze it.

10:39.754 --> 10:41.322
I'll take it to him.

10:41.390 --> 10:42.830
You keep an eye
on the investigation,

10:42.891 --> 10:44.959
and, you, try to keep
a lid on your friend.

10:48.229 --> 10:51.264
So much for my me time.

10:54.902 --> 10:56.436
We got a situation.

10:57.771 --> 11:00.107
Come in.
Make yourself at home.

11:00.174 --> 11:01.654
JT, Catherine was attacked
by a beast.

11:01.675 --> 11:02.942
I need you to I.D. this.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.977
What do you mean
Catherine was attacked?

11:05.044 --> 11:05.844
What beast?

11:05.912 --> 11:08.147
Vincent!
When?

11:08.215 --> 11:10.382
Hey! Didn't know
you were here.

11:10.450 --> 11:12.951
Just tell me what happened
to her. Is she okay?

11:13.019 --> 11:15.354
Listen, why don't you let me
handle this, okay?

11:15.422 --> 11:16.955
I mean, we're
all friends here, right?

11:17.023 --> 11:18.190
Actually,
we're all not friends.

11:18.258 --> 11:19.291
Is Cat okay?

11:19.359 --> 11:20.525
Yes, she is, but...

11:24.029 --> 11:25.896
You gotta talk faster.

11:29.101 --> 11:32.803
Check the archives, blogs,
tweets, everything.

11:32.871 --> 11:35.140
I can't be the only one
who's seen something like this.

11:35.207 --> 11:37.007
Yes, I realize that,
but we just need

11:37.074 --> 11:39.643
one other witness,
and I know I can take it to air.

11:39.710 --> 11:41.478
Beth.

11:41.546 --> 11:43.580
Trust me, I'll make it
a credible story.

11:43.648 --> 11:45.549
Just start digging.

11:47.084 --> 11:50.320
Why are you covering this up,
Cat, huh?

11:50.388 --> 11:52.388
What are you
not telling me?

11:52.456 --> 11:54.357
Come on, Beth,
there's gotta be some

11:54.424 --> 11:55.824
logical explanation for
what you think you saw.

11:55.892 --> 11:58.761
I am... I am just trying
to protect you.

11:58.828 --> 11:59.995
Oh, really? how?

12:00.063 --> 12:01.864
Okay, you have built
a reputation.

12:01.931 --> 12:04.099
You've got integrity.
You're not some

12:04.168 --> 12:06.101
tabloid reporter
reporting on bigfoot.

12:06.170 --> 12:08.570
No, I'm an honest reporter

12:08.638 --> 12:10.505
who's going to report
what I witnessed.

12:10.573 --> 12:14.042
But if you air this unconfirmed,
you're ruined, and you know it.

12:14.109 --> 12:17.712
Please, just let my
colleagues do their job,

12:17.780 --> 12:19.214
let them investigate this.

12:19.282 --> 12:21.616
Give them some time
and wait for the facts.

12:23.786 --> 12:27.521
And in the meantime,
can we please enjoy

12:27.589 --> 12:28.722
this reunion tomorrow night?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.624
It only comes around
every ten years,

12:30.692 --> 12:35.396
and I really, really don't want
to miss it because of this.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.631
Do you?
Okay.

12:37.699 --> 12:40.533
Just promise me
the exclusive?

12:40.601 --> 12:42.602
Deal.

12:43.671 --> 12:45.371
It's been a long night.

12:45.406 --> 12:47.740
Uh, why don't you pour us
a couple glasses of wine,

12:47.808 --> 12:49.075
and I will be right back.

12:49.142 --> 12:50.142
Got it.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.549
What are you doing here?

12:59.652 --> 13:01.486
I'm making sure you're okay.

13:01.554 --> 13:04.055
I told Gabe not to tell you.

13:04.123 --> 13:05.757
I didn't really give him
a choice.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.428
What'd this guy look like?

13:09.495 --> 13:13.264
I don't know.
Like, like you, sort of.

13:24.543 --> 13:26.176
Just let JT I.D. him first.

13:26.245 --> 13:27.911
The beast is
still after you.

13:27.979 --> 13:29.613
Don't worry about me.

13:32.750 --> 13:36.353
I promise you,
he won't hurt you again, okay?

13:42.393 --> 13:44.793
â™ª They say the devil
is among us â™ª

13:44.861 --> 13:47.696
â™ª He's looking for a friend â™ª

13:47.764 --> 13:51.467
â™ª So buy yourself forgiveness
if your heart is full of sin â™ª

13:51.534 --> 13:53.014
â™ª Temptation gives you
what you want â™ª

13:53.035 --> 13:55.337
â™ª Not what you need

13:55.405 --> 14:00.308
â™ª The ruin of all mankind
is power and it's greed â™ª

14:00.376 --> 14:04.044
â™ª So if we only have tonight

14:05.381 --> 14:08.983
â™ª If this is the last moment â™ª

14:09.050 --> 14:11.786
â™ª Would you change your life?

14:42.716 --> 14:45.151
I know you're here.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.253
I knew you'd show up...

14:47.321 --> 14:49.688
beast hunter.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.595
Holy crap.

14:57.663 --> 14:58.430
Vincent?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.601
I thought you
were dead, man!

15:08.440 --> 15:10.274
It's me, it's Zach.

15:11.944 --> 15:13.577
Delta Company!

15:13.645 --> 15:15.546
We served together!

15:23.420 --> 15:27.023
Hey! We're friends!

15:28.691 --> 15:30.759
It's me, Zach!

15:37.100 --> 15:38.200
<i>We're friends!</i>

15:46.108 --> 15:47.775
Zach?

15:47.843 --> 15:50.578
I'll be damned.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.981
Vincent Keller.

15:53.048 --> 15:55.383
Been a long time.

16:01.282 --> 16:02.883
Have you heard from Vincent yet?

16:02.951 --> 16:04.462
I should just leave the damn
door open from now on.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.142
JT, focus.

16:05.167 --> 16:06.608
No, I haven't heard
from Vincent yet.

16:06.646 --> 16:07.828
Have you been able
to I.D. the, uh...?

16:07.829 --> 16:09.238
No.

16:10.123 --> 16:11.324
Aren't you worried?

16:11.392 --> 16:12.826
Always.

16:12.893 --> 16:16.329
You rolled a 12,
raked in five grand.

16:16.397 --> 16:18.998
You ruled Atlantic City
that night, man.

16:19.066 --> 16:21.500
Yeah, I just, I wish
I could remember it.

16:21.568 --> 16:23.769
Vincent...
Catherine, it's-it's okay..

16:23.837 --> 16:26.104
Uh, this is...
Zach.

16:26.172 --> 16:28.340
Zach Hayes.

16:28.408 --> 16:30.075
Hey, JT, good
to see you again, pal.

16:30.142 --> 16:31.977
You look, uh, like you lost
some weight there.

16:32.044 --> 16:33.412
Okay, hold on.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.780
You know him?

16:34.848 --> 16:37.815
Yeah. I was at
his funeral.

16:37.883 --> 16:39.684
Which was right
before yours.

16:39.752 --> 16:42.019
Okay, someone explain.

16:42.087 --> 16:45.790
Okay. Well, Zach and I, we
served in Afghanistan together.

16:45.858 --> 16:47.958
And, uh, we both volunteered
for Muirfield.

16:48.026 --> 16:49.494
And both supposedly

16:49.561 --> 16:52.029
died ten years ago
because of the experiments.

16:52.097 --> 16:54.364
I thought Vincent was
the only soldier

16:54.432 --> 16:55.832
from his unit to survive.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.301
And I thought I was
the only one, until now.

16:59.871 --> 17:02.472
Listen, ma'am,
I was telling Vincent,

17:02.540 --> 17:04.339
I can't apologize enough for...

17:04.409 --> 17:05.842
Trying to kill me?

17:05.910 --> 17:08.477
I didn't mean you any harm.

17:08.545 --> 17:11.113
It was really just
all about survival, you know?

17:11.180 --> 17:13.015
No, I don't, actually.

17:14.217 --> 17:16.184
Over the years, I-I heard

17:16.252 --> 17:18.621
there were other people like me,

17:18.688 --> 17:21.290
and when they started getting
knocked off recently...

17:21.357 --> 17:23.858
Right. Zach thought
that he may be next.

17:23.926 --> 17:25.627
I picked up his scent
where the others were killed.

17:25.694 --> 17:27.994
And figured you'd take the fight
to Vince first?

17:28.063 --> 17:29.631
Is that it?

17:29.698 --> 17:31.399
Yeah, but I didn't know
it was Vincent.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.368
And then the trail
led me to her.

17:34.437 --> 17:35.904
To you.

17:38.874 --> 17:41.241
Look, Catherine, he didn't
realize how important

17:41.309 --> 17:42.810
you are to me.

17:42.877 --> 17:45.312
But he does now, right?

17:45.379 --> 17:46.986
Yeah, you made that
very clear to me.

17:47.011 --> 17:48.449
Right.

17:48.450 --> 17:50.250
You're really lucky to have
somebody like him

17:50.318 --> 17:51.585
looking out for you, ma'am.

17:53.721 --> 17:55.522
You're lucky, too.

17:57.324 --> 17:59.525
So, that's it?

17:59.593 --> 18:00.893
You guys are
drinking buddies again?

18:00.961 --> 18:02.662
Everything's hunky dory?

18:02.729 --> 18:03.830
Have a nice day?

18:03.897 --> 18:05.364
I-I said I was sorry.

18:05.432 --> 18:06.899
I've been minding
my own business,

18:06.967 --> 18:08.701
living off the grid
for ten years, okay?

18:08.769 --> 18:11.203
I don't want
any trouble, you know?

18:11.271 --> 18:14.038
Especially now that I got
an old friend back here.

18:14.106 --> 18:15.239
We're gonna have some fun.

18:15.307 --> 18:16.240
Yeah.

18:19.512 --> 18:20.879
I don't trust him.

18:20.947 --> 18:22.547
He may be Vincent's
army buddy or whatever,

18:22.615 --> 18:24.115
but he tried to kill me.

18:24.183 --> 18:26.384
Wait, and Vincent still
wants to hang with him?

18:26.452 --> 18:27.719
He's desperate
to reclaim his memories,

18:27.787 --> 18:28.953
and Zach's a new resource.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.287
All right, I get that.

18:30.355 --> 18:31.589
I'm running
a background check

18:31.656 --> 18:33.624
with his DNA,
see what pops up.

18:33.692 --> 18:35.058
Yeah, but what happened

18:35.126 --> 18:36.560
to primping up
for your reunion?

18:36.628 --> 18:38.362
I can't possibly go
to that now.

18:38.429 --> 18:39.930
Why not?

18:39.998 --> 18:41.298
What, are you serious?

18:41.366 --> 18:43.734
Don't you think
I want to go?

18:43.802 --> 18:46.569
I'm pissed that
I'm missing it because of this.

18:46.637 --> 18:47.971
You don't have to.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.239
Don't give me that face.

18:49.307 --> 18:50.868
I know how much you were
looking forward

18:50.875 --> 18:52.075
to this weekend.

18:52.143 --> 18:53.343
You know, you finally
carve out

18:53.344 --> 18:55.145
a little bit of time
for yourself,

18:55.213 --> 18:57.314
which Vincent has yet
again compromised.

18:57.382 --> 18:59.116
He didn't mean to.

18:59.183 --> 19:02.218
It's not his fault
that beasts keep

19:02.285 --> 19:03.652
showing up
out of the woodwork.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.421
Yeah, well, it's not
your fault, either,

19:05.489 --> 19:06.889
or always your
responsibility.

19:06.956 --> 19:09.091
Come on, Cat, stick
to your guns, okay?

19:09.159 --> 19:11.427
You only get one
ten-year reunion.

19:11.495 --> 19:12.961
You should enjoy it.

19:13.030 --> 19:13.962
I know, but...

19:14.031 --> 19:15.398
No, no buts.
You need to put

19:15.465 --> 19:17.798
the same time and effort
into your own needs

19:17.866 --> 19:19.267
as you do
into helping Vincent.

19:19.335 --> 19:20.335
Easier said than done.

19:20.403 --> 19:22.504
All right, how about this, okay?

19:22.571 --> 19:25.140
If it'll help,
I will look into Zach.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.287
If I find anything big,
I'll let you know, all right?

19:27.309 --> 19:30.445
Go, have a life,
get your Ashanti on.

19:32.081 --> 19:33.980
Forget about Vincent for once.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.183
Okay.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.257
Mm! Still got the touch.

19:43.324 --> 19:45.859
So, uh, what,
did we play here a lot?

19:45.927 --> 19:48.529
After we enlisted, definitely.

19:48.596 --> 19:50.629
By the way, I've been
meaning to ask you,

19:50.697 --> 19:53.166
why are you going after
all these other...

19:53.233 --> 19:56.169
you know, beasts?

19:56.236 --> 19:59.004
Well, that is on
a need-to-know basis,

19:59.073 --> 20:00.773
and you don't need to know.

20:00.840 --> 20:01.807
Ooh.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.644
So, anything?
Anything?

20:07.713 --> 20:09.314
No.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.716
You can't force his memories
to come back, you know.

20:11.784 --> 20:15.220
Yeah? Well, how's it happened
before, then?

20:15.288 --> 20:17.456
Uh, I guess I got a trigger
or something.

20:17.523 --> 20:19.391
A sound or a touch.

20:19.459 --> 20:21.959
An emotion that reminds me
of something.

20:22.026 --> 20:24.728
In that case, you definitely
need to remember Gabriella.

20:24.796 --> 20:25.696
Who?

20:25.763 --> 20:28.031
Man, you are killing me!

20:28.100 --> 20:30.201
You don't remember Gabriella?
Uh-uh.

20:30.268 --> 20:31.635
You have to remember her.

20:31.703 --> 20:32.803
You remember Gabriella, right?

20:32.870 --> 20:34.638
Yeah, but what's so important?

20:34.706 --> 20:36.707
She's the kind of girl
you don't want to forget.

20:36.774 --> 20:38.674
Who is she?
She was your babe, man,

20:38.742 --> 20:40.410
before you deployed.

20:40.478 --> 20:41.811
I mean, she loved you.

20:41.878 --> 20:43.879
Really?

20:43.947 --> 20:46.349
I-I thought I was engaged
to someone named Alex.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.518
Um, yeah, but...

20:48.586 --> 20:50.019
you were going
off to war,

20:50.087 --> 20:51.721
and you and Alex
kind of separated.

20:51.788 --> 20:53.855
Anyway, who wants
another round?

20:53.923 --> 20:56.825
But you didn't waste any time
going after Gabriella.

20:56.892 --> 20:58.927
She said you were real smooth.

21:00.463 --> 21:02.831
I'm sorry. How would you know?

21:02.898 --> 21:06.001
I thought they met
after you shipped out.

21:06.068 --> 21:07.869
Yeah, but I knew her first.

21:07.937 --> 21:09.437
She wrote to me

21:09.505 --> 21:10.838
when I was overseas.

21:10.905 --> 21:12.065
She told me everything, so...

21:13.342 --> 21:14.542
Excuse me.

21:14.610 --> 21:17.445
Are you boys doing okay?

21:23.918 --> 21:26.686
Yeah, we're all set
here. Thank you.

21:27.755 --> 21:29.189
Wow. I...

21:29.257 --> 21:30.790
Wh-What?

21:30.858 --> 21:31.958
You got a hit,
didn't you?

21:32.026 --> 21:33.026
I think so.

21:33.093 --> 21:34.093
That's good.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.262
We're making
progress.

21:36.497 --> 21:37.897
All right.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.374
Lowan.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.442
Oh. Agent Reynolds.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.578
To what do I owe the pleasure?

21:53.646 --> 21:55.446
I heard about the assault
on Cath...

21:55.514 --> 21:56.748
Detective Chandler
at morning briefing.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.949
How is she?

21:58.017 --> 21:59.384
She's fine.
Good.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.153
Have you I.D.'d
the assailant?

22:01.220 --> 22:03.789
I mean, because he might want
to make another attempt.

22:03.856 --> 22:04.955
I'm sorry.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.390
I didn't know that this case

22:06.457 --> 22:07.892
fell under the FBI's
jurisdiction.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.126
It doesn't.

22:09.194 --> 22:10.761
But I promised her...
her father

22:10.829 --> 22:12.096
that I would look after her.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.966
I just need
to know if she's okay.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.601
Well, that's very kind of you.
I'll be sure

22:17.669 --> 22:19.109
to let Catherine know
you stopped by.

22:20.638 --> 22:22.271
So one of your own gets attacked
and you're saying

22:22.339 --> 22:23.406
you don't need the FBI's help?

22:23.473 --> 22:25.408
Come on, Lowan.

22:25.475 --> 22:26.843
I'm not the bad guy here.

22:26.911 --> 22:28.277
Loop me in.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.414
You really want to help?

22:31.481 --> 22:32.982
Yes, I do.

22:33.050 --> 22:34.450
I've been trying to
help Detective Chandler

22:34.518 --> 22:35.685
find her birth father.

22:35.753 --> 22:37.019
I've been running
into a lot

22:37.087 --> 22:38.620
of high-level
interference.

22:38.688 --> 22:40.989
Any chance the FBI can help
cut through some of it?

22:41.057 --> 22:42.290
Sure.

22:42.358 --> 22:44.026
See what I can do.

22:44.094 --> 22:46.361
Guess what.
I think Cat was actually...

22:47.597 --> 22:48.764
It's okay.

22:48.832 --> 22:50.265
What do you got?

22:50.333 --> 22:53.367
Well, I, uh...
I tied Zachary Hayes' DNA

22:53.435 --> 22:56.337
to a cold case from 2005--
the murder of

22:56.404 --> 22:57.772
a Gabriella Bauer, age 24.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.306
Murder?

22:59.374 --> 23:01.042
The coroner's report said

23:01.110 --> 23:03.444
the victim's remains
were found in shreds.

23:03.511 --> 23:05.512
Where's Detective Chandler
right now?

23:05.580 --> 23:06.948
On her way to her
high school reunion.

23:07.015 --> 23:08.216
Find her.
Make sure she's safe.

23:08.283 --> 23:09.482
I've got Hayes.

23:11.385 --> 23:13.653
Check out these newbies.

23:13.721 --> 23:16.522
All bright-eyed
and gung ho.

23:16.590 --> 23:18.792
Ready to lay down
their lives for their country.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.693
That was us, man.

23:20.762 --> 23:22.362
Who knew what they'd
do to us, right?

23:22.429 --> 23:24.064
Mm-hmm.

23:25.632 --> 23:27.332
What do you say

23:27.400 --> 23:28.634
we call it a day?

23:28.701 --> 23:29.802
What's your problem?

23:31.404 --> 23:33.705
You got a curfew?

23:35.142 --> 23:38.210
Yeah, JT, uh, you can
go home if you want.

23:38.278 --> 23:40.379
I think... I just had
a flash, you know?

23:40.446 --> 23:42.147
- I think it's helping.
- Mmm.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.149
See that? This is helping.

23:45.251 --> 23:46.684
Hey.

23:46.752 --> 23:49.387
You're telling me
that girl right there

23:49.454 --> 23:51.522
don't remind you
of Gabriella?

23:51.590 --> 23:54.759
Those lips, those eyes.

24:03.001 --> 24:04.367
What?

24:04.435 --> 24:05.669
What'd you see?

24:05.736 --> 24:06.870
Uh...

24:06.938 --> 24:10.073
I-I think I saw Gabriella.

24:10.141 --> 24:12.042
You remember her?

24:12.110 --> 24:14.043
Beautiful, wasn't she?

24:14.111 --> 24:16.112
Yeah, ye, , she was.

24:26.023 --> 24:28.224
You remember how
you stole her from me?

24:28.292 --> 24:29.424
Yeah.

24:29.491 --> 24:30.558
See, I shipped off.

24:30.626 --> 24:33.428
You stayed behind
to nail my girl.

24:34.964 --> 24:36.064
Your girl?

24:36.132 --> 24:38.366
Damn straight.
She wrote me a letter.

24:38.434 --> 24:42.237
She told me she fell in love
with another recruit.

24:42.305 --> 24:44.206
Vincent Keller.

24:44.273 --> 24:45.572
Okay, come on, Zach,
you know I don't remember...

24:45.640 --> 24:46.807
No, no, no, no, no.

24:46.875 --> 24:48.608
I was supposed
to come home to her.

24:48.676 --> 24:50.945
She was supposed to be waiting for me,
Okay, hold on...

24:51.012 --> 24:52.279
but she dumped me for you!

24:53.982 --> 24:55.916
Do you remember her now?!
Hey! Buddy!

24:55.984 --> 24:57.051
What the hell is
your problem, man?

24:57.118 --> 24:58.078
Are you out
of your mind?

24:58.119 --> 24:59.586
People are watching.

25:07.061 --> 25:09.295
You're a dead man, Keller.
You understand me?

25:10.530 --> 25:12.498
You ripped my heart out...

25:14.001 --> 25:17.435
...and now I am going
to rip out yours.

25:29.476 --> 25:31.242
Hi.

25:31.310 --> 25:32.376
Check you out, girl.

25:32.445 --> 25:33.878
Ten years has
nothing on you.

25:33.946 --> 25:35.914
Look at you, hot mama.
You're all aglow.

25:35.981 --> 25:37.916
Oh, I am not glowing;
I am perspiring.

25:39.585 --> 25:42.420
No, she's nervous.
Kim Pisano's checking us in.

25:43.823 --> 25:45.122
Kim Pisano.

25:45.190 --> 25:46.757
Once a mean girl,
always a mean girl.

25:46.825 --> 25:48.559
Oh, my God, did you guys
see Stacy Meyers?

25:48.626 --> 25:51.027
She looks fantastic.

25:51.095 --> 25:53.129
She finally got
that thing removed.

25:53.197 --> 25:54.598
Cat, did you see... Cat!

25:54.666 --> 25:56.199
What? Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:56.267 --> 25:58.108
Yeah. Can you connect it
to any other assaults?

25:58.135 --> 25:59.803
Well, keep trying

25:59.871 --> 26:02.605
and just be ready to go to air
as soon as I get the exclusive.

26:02.673 --> 26:04.073
Both of you, stop.

26:04.140 --> 26:06.642
We are not just
revisiting the past tonight;

26:06.710 --> 26:09.044
we are being
fully present.

26:09.112 --> 26:10.412
Radio silence.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.948
Thank you.
You win.

26:12.015 --> 26:14.083
Okay.

26:14.150 --> 26:15.885
Beth!

26:15.953 --> 26:17.052
I got to go.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.454
Thank you.
Happy?

26:18.522 --> 26:20.122
Yes. Yes.
I'd be a lot happier

26:20.190 --> 26:21.890
if I could drink, but yes.

26:21.958 --> 26:23.058
Let's party, girls,

26:23.126 --> 26:24.259
like it's 2003.

26:24.327 --> 26:25.461
Hi, Kim.

26:25.528 --> 26:27.796
Catherine Chandler.

26:27.864 --> 26:30.599
We were lab partners
in tenth grade bio.

26:30.666 --> 26:32.334
Oh, right.

26:32.402 --> 26:34.503
I used to copy off you.

26:36.405 --> 26:38.473
Um, no plus-one tonight?

26:44.213 --> 26:45.746
I just...
I can't believe

26:45.814 --> 26:47.281
that Zach thinks I betrayed him.

26:47.349 --> 26:50.018
Dude, I swear, you had no idea

26:50.085 --> 26:51.325
that girl was
involved with him.

26:51.386 --> 26:52.585
How do you know this?

26:52.653 --> 26:53.920
Because you told
me everything,

26:53.988 --> 26:55.255
and I remember.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.590
You-you had a little
romance for a few weeks,

26:57.658 --> 26:59.493
then met up with
Zach in Afghanistan.

26:59.560 --> 27:01.294
You did not break the bro code.

27:01.362 --> 27:05.165
Okay. I mean, good. I-I just...
I need to talk to him.

27:05.233 --> 27:07.333
I need to make him understand.
What?

27:07.401 --> 27:09.168
He's a beast. You can't
reason with him.

27:10.770 --> 27:12.505
He's not like you.

27:12.572 --> 27:14.940
All this time on his own,
that-that anger's built up.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.275
It's eaten away at him.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.643
Which is why I got to try.

27:17.710 --> 27:19.445
Okay?

27:19.513 --> 27:21.213
I fought with this guy.
I served with him.

27:21.281 --> 27:23.381
But he hates you now, and he
already went after Cat once.

27:23.449 --> 27:25.616
Which is why I got to
make him understand, okay?

27:25.684 --> 27:27.152
So it never happens again.

27:35.227 --> 27:36.727
You've reached
Catherine Chandler.

27:36.795 --> 27:38.329
Leave a message.
Damn.

27:38.397 --> 27:40.064
â™ª One, two, three, uh!

27:40.098 --> 27:41.731
â™ª My baby don't mess around â™ª

27:41.799 --> 27:43.800
â™ª Because she loves me so

27:43.868 --> 27:47.171
â™ª And this I know for sure

27:47.238 --> 27:48.738
â™ª Uh!

27:48.806 --> 27:50.874
â™ª But does she really wanna

27:50.942 --> 27:53.343
â™ª But can't stand to see me â™ª

27:53.411 --> 27:55.644
â™ª Walk out the door?

27:55.712 --> 27:59.315
â™ª Don't try to fight
the feeling â™ª

27:59.383 --> 28:00.883
â™ª 'Cause the thought alone â™ª

28:00.951 --> 28:02.985
â™ª Is killing me right now...

28:03.053 --> 28:03.986
Hey, Cat.

28:04.921 --> 28:06.589
It's me. Ira.

28:06.656 --> 28:08.891
Ira Webster.
Ira!

28:08.959 --> 28:11.593
I see you're still rocking
the mascot costume.

28:11.660 --> 28:13.161
And you're rocking
the dance floor.

28:13.229 --> 28:15.029
You've still got
those sweet moves.

28:15.098 --> 28:17.031
Thanks.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.032
Hey there, Wolves.

28:18.101 --> 28:19.601
Hi.

28:19.668 --> 28:20.868
Uh, just pardon
the interruption.

28:20.936 --> 28:22.104
This is your class treasurer,

28:22.171 --> 28:23.605
Beth Bowman, here.

28:23.672 --> 28:26.741
I hope we're all having
a great night, yeah?

28:26.809 --> 28:28.875
Right?

28:28.943 --> 28:32.713
Okay, just a small,
quick announcement.

28:32.780 --> 28:36.583
We are finally breaking ground
on the new swimming pool.

28:37.818 --> 28:39.452
Remember the
time the team

28:39.520 --> 28:42.422
tied me up and left me dangling
from the goalpost?

28:42.490 --> 28:44.457
Uh, yeah, that was...
that was terrible.

28:44.525 --> 28:45.891
I happen to have
some pledge cards

28:45.959 --> 28:47.293
here in my hand,
and they're available

28:47.361 --> 28:48.928
throughout the room.
You helped me down.

28:48.996 --> 28:51.463
Yeah, and you
told them off.

28:51.531 --> 28:53.398
I said I'd be your
slave for life.

28:53.466 --> 28:54.699
Search your hearts.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.368
That offer still stands.

28:56.436 --> 28:58.069
Dig deep into your pockets,

28:58.138 --> 28:59.904
and remember...
Uh, um...

28:59.972 --> 29:01.940
this is our legacy!

29:03.543 --> 29:04.809
Thank you!

29:04.877 --> 29:06.377
Excuse me.

29:09.014 --> 29:10.615
Hey. Could I grab one

29:10.682 --> 29:12.150
of those cards?
Are you kidding?

29:12.217 --> 29:13.551
I-I mean, it'd be great,

29:13.619 --> 29:16.220
but your father's been
so generous already.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.888
Plus, everyone knows
how much you fought

29:17.956 --> 29:19.557
for the pool
in the first place.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.258
Wait, my... my dad donated?

29:21.325 --> 29:23.126
Yeah, in your name, too.

29:23.194 --> 29:24.727
Oh.

29:24.795 --> 29:26.896
I get a money order from him
like clockwork every August.

29:26.964 --> 29:29.132
But not this past August.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.400
Yeah.

29:30.468 --> 29:32.169
Why?

29:32.236 --> 29:35.838
No, my, uh...
my dad died in July.

29:35.906 --> 29:37.673
Catherine.

29:38.808 --> 29:40.442
What are you guys doing here?

29:40.510 --> 29:42.178
Uh, did you guys
find her assailant?

29:42.245 --> 29:43.812
Uh, not yet.
Please excuse us.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.813
Sorry.

29:44.881 --> 29:46.282
Look, sorry to crash your party,

29:46.349 --> 29:47.650
but you didn't
answer your phone.

29:47.717 --> 29:50.085
What's wrong? Is it Vincent?

29:51.254 --> 29:53.088
No, it doesn't make sense, okay?

29:53.156 --> 29:55.156
Zach loved Gabriella.

29:55.224 --> 29:57.124
He came back from the war.

29:57.193 --> 29:59.093
He sought her out.
He slaughtered her.

29:59.161 --> 30:00.528
But if you knew that,

30:00.596 --> 30:02.463
then how come he wasn't
on your hit list?

30:02.531 --> 30:04.332
He is. I just didn't know
how to proceed

30:04.400 --> 30:05.833
because of your history.

30:05.901 --> 30:08.035
But now that he found you,
you got no choice.

30:08.103 --> 30:09.536
Take him out. He's a killer.

30:09.604 --> 30:11.305
Yeah, because of what
Muirfield did to him.

30:11.372 --> 30:13.106
That's beside the point
right now.

30:13.174 --> 30:14.374
Is it?

30:14.442 --> 30:15.842
Because, sir,
the man that I knew,

30:15.910 --> 30:17.444
he was a patriot, okay?

30:17.512 --> 30:19.479
He was a good soldier.

30:21.182 --> 30:23.317
I can still reach out
to him, okay?

30:23.384 --> 30:24.651
I got to explain.

30:24.719 --> 30:26.719
Spending all that time
with Catherine

30:26.786 --> 30:28.221
is making you soft.

30:29.423 --> 30:31.490
What's that supposed to mean?

30:31.558 --> 30:35.127
Listen, you can't let
your emotions interfere.

30:35.195 --> 30:36.395
It weakens you.

30:36.463 --> 30:37.830
It makes you vulnerable to him.

30:37.897 --> 30:39.064
Sir,

30:39.132 --> 30:40.966
I know what I'm doing.

30:53.045 --> 30:55.347
Zach.

30:55.414 --> 30:57.881
I've been
waiting for you.

31:01.386 --> 31:03.387
Zach, buddy,
you don't understand, okay?

31:03.455 --> 31:05.356
I never betrayed you.

31:05.423 --> 31:07.424
Like hell you didn't.

31:07.492 --> 31:10.026
You're not thinking straight.

31:10.094 --> 31:13.096
I know it's not
your fault, all right?

31:13.164 --> 31:14.364
Muirfield did this.

31:14.431 --> 31:15.765
They changed us.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.767
They tapped into our rage,

31:17.834 --> 31:19.869
and they made us these killers.

31:19.936 --> 31:22.204
These beasts.

31:22.273 --> 31:24.907
But we are still men.

31:24.975 --> 31:28.544
And we can never let them
take that away from us, okay?

31:28.612 --> 31:30.312
You stole her.

31:34.183 --> 31:35.183
Zach, listen to me...

31:35.251 --> 31:36.518
No, you listen to me.

31:36.586 --> 31:37.786
Before I kill you,

31:37.853 --> 31:40.088
I want you to suffer
like I suffered.

31:40.156 --> 31:43.091
You took my Gabriella
away from me,

31:43.159 --> 31:45.693
and now I am going to take
your precious Catherine

31:45.761 --> 31:47.027
away from you.

31:49.698 --> 31:52.032
She's dead, Vincent!

31:55.283 --> 31:56.784
â™ª Here in your head...

31:56.852 --> 31:57.933
The truth is, we don't know

31:57.986 --> 31:59.026
where Vincent is, or Zach.

31:59.510 --> 32:01.044
JT called,

32:01.112 --> 32:02.379
maybe he knows.
JT doesn't know, either.

32:02.446 --> 32:03.679
All he knows is

32:03.747 --> 32:05.548
Vincent left to try
and reason with Zach.

32:05.616 --> 32:06.749
Reason with him?

32:06.817 --> 32:08.083
We have to find Vincent.

32:08.151 --> 32:09.785
Catherine, I'm more
concerned about you.

32:09.852 --> 32:12.388
Zach already attacked you once
to get to him,

32:12.455 --> 32:14.456
which means until we know
exactly where Zach is...

32:14.524 --> 32:16.926
We should get her out of here.

32:16.993 --> 32:19.028
What is it?

32:19.095 --> 32:20.796
Ten years ago,

32:20.863 --> 32:22.731
I thought I would be
a lawyer like my father,

32:22.799 --> 32:24.466
married,
with kids, Botox.

32:24.534 --> 32:26.568
And now,
ten years later,

32:26.636 --> 32:28.069
I am in love
with one beast

32:28.137 --> 32:29.304
and I am running
from another.

32:31.006 --> 32:33.241
So much for
"Most Likely to Succeed."

32:33.309 --> 32:35.911
Catherine.
Vincent, you're okay.

32:35.978 --> 32:37.746
Yeah. I gotta get you
out of here now.

32:37.814 --> 32:39.247
Is it Zach?

32:39.315 --> 32:40.815
Yeah.

32:40.882 --> 32:42.583
Come on, let's get
you out of here.

32:42.651 --> 32:44.117
No, I got her, thank you.

32:46.455 --> 32:48.088
It's okay.
Okay, you take her out back,

32:48.156 --> 32:50.157
we'll watch the lobby.

32:50.224 --> 32:51.492
You'll be all right?

32:51.560 --> 32:52.927
Yes.
She'll be fine.

32:56.330 --> 32:57.897
Look, I'm so sorry
about all this.

32:57.965 --> 32:59.131
No, it's not
your fault.

32:59.199 --> 33:02.969
â™ª Way down under...

33:08.676 --> 33:09.609
Whoa.

33:14.848 --> 33:16.748
Catherine...
Come on, wait.

33:16.816 --> 33:18.750
Why? I thought you
said we had to go.

33:18.818 --> 33:19.751
You're upset.

33:19.819 --> 33:20.919
Why would I be upset?

33:20.987 --> 33:22.488
It's just
a high school reunion.

33:22.555 --> 33:24.756
It's not like I was
actually looking forward to this

33:24.824 --> 33:26.024
or anything.

33:26.092 --> 33:28.292
You know, I said
I was sorry.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.762
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

33:37.903 --> 33:39.269
I know all of...

33:39.337 --> 33:42.272
all of this
pales in comparison

33:42.340 --> 33:45.842
to what you're going through,
why you're here, but...

33:45.910 --> 33:47.276
What?

33:47.344 --> 33:49.345
I don't know.

33:49.413 --> 33:53.984
I guess I just feel silly
whining about my crap

33:54.051 --> 33:55.986
when you're fighting beasts

33:56.053 --> 33:58.054
and trying to even
figure out who you are,

33:58.122 --> 33:59.389
you know what I mean?

33:59.456 --> 34:01.724
Uh, I never realized
you felt like that.

34:10.065 --> 34:12.001
Just tell me
what I can do, okay?

34:12.068 --> 34:13.802
Nothing.

34:13.870 --> 34:15.804
I told you, this...
this isn't your fault.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.156
Hey, buddy
come on, man.

35:53.213 --> 35:54.914
The guy survived
Afghanistan,

35:54.982 --> 35:57.250
then gets killed
at a reunion in Westchester?

35:57.318 --> 35:58.718
Doesn't seem right.

35:58.786 --> 36:00.420
Chalk another one
up to Muirfield.

36:00.488 --> 36:02.322
Excuse me, Mr. Lowan?

36:02.390 --> 36:04.156
Yes, um... Beth, right?

36:04.223 --> 36:05.491
That is right.

36:05.558 --> 36:08.160
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

36:08.227 --> 36:09.395
That man--

36:09.462 --> 36:10.396
the soldier--

36:10.463 --> 36:11.397
why do you think

36:11.464 --> 36:12.531
he was after Detective Chandler?

36:12.599 --> 36:14.833
Um...

36:14.901 --> 36:16.335
right now, we don't know.

36:16.403 --> 36:20.104
Uh, obviously,
he suffered from PTSD,

36:20.172 --> 36:22.940
but we think she was probably
just a random victim.

36:23.008 --> 36:24.342
Random?

36:24.410 --> 36:26.344
He attacked her
in her home and here.

36:26.412 --> 36:27.773
Now, does that sound
random to you?

36:27.780 --> 36:28.946
It sounds like
something

36:29.014 --> 36:30.415
that's still under
investigation,

36:30.482 --> 36:32.082
and as soon as
we find anything out,

36:32.150 --> 36:33.751
we'll let
you know, okay?

36:33.819 --> 36:35.419
Thanks.

36:35.486 --> 36:37.954
Um, just out of curiosity,

36:38.022 --> 36:40.223
was there anything...

36:40.291 --> 36:43.627
I don't know,
unusual about Mr. Hayes?

36:43.695 --> 36:46.262
Any physical
anomalies?

36:46.331 --> 36:47.864
You mean,
like a birthmark?

36:47.932 --> 36:49.098
Could you be more specific?

36:51.001 --> 36:53.235
Not at this time.

36:55.305 --> 36:56.472
She didn't seem
very happy.

36:56.540 --> 36:57.740
Yeah, but
the mayor will be.

36:57.808 --> 36:59.274
You know, for now.

36:59.343 --> 37:00.876
Solved a cold case,
tossed him a bone.

37:00.944 --> 37:03.612
Or at least didn't add
another one to the pile.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.748
Oh, and, uh,
by the way, little tip?

37:05.816 --> 37:07.716
If you want to have
a shot with Cat,

37:07.783 --> 37:10.151
you might not want to go
mano-a-mano with a beast.

37:10.219 --> 37:11.986
No, spare me
your mock shock.

37:12.054 --> 37:13.955
Your feelings for her
are pretty obvious.

37:14.022 --> 37:16.924
What?

37:16.992 --> 37:18.460
To Catherine, too?

37:18.527 --> 37:19.961
I don't know.

37:20.028 --> 37:21.229
Maybe.

37:32.574 --> 37:35.308
Are you sure
you're okay?

37:35.377 --> 37:37.911
Got no headache,
nausea, dizziness...?

37:37.979 --> 37:40.946
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

37:41.014 --> 37:43.616
It's funny how you remember
how to be a doctor,

37:43.684 --> 37:46.318
but you don't actually
remember being a doctor.

37:46.387 --> 37:48.521
Well, I guess it's all
coming back to me,

37:48.589 --> 37:50.356
slowly but surely.

37:50.424 --> 37:53.192
Even the bad things.

37:58.197 --> 38:01.165
Look, Catherine, I'm...
I'm sorry about...

38:01.233 --> 38:02.467
No, it's okay.

38:02.535 --> 38:03.702
No, it's not.

38:03.770 --> 38:05.704
I feel horrible

38:05.772 --> 38:07.138
for what you've
been going through,

38:07.206 --> 38:09.808
how much you've been
sacrificing for me.

38:09.876 --> 38:12.342
I had no idea.

38:12.411 --> 38:14.978
But I guess with
my memories coming back,

38:15.046 --> 38:17.448
I'm slowly beginning
to realize

38:17.516 --> 38:20.217
exactly what you
really do for me.

38:20.285 --> 38:22.653
And how much
that costs you.

38:26.725 --> 38:29.726
You know, once these
missions are over,

38:29.794 --> 38:33.563
I promise you that I will
make this all up to you.

38:36.033 --> 38:38.067
What?

38:38.135 --> 38:40.470
Nothing. Just...

38:40.538 --> 38:42.038
thank you.

38:43.807 --> 38:45.741
I should be
thanking you.

38:47.410 --> 38:50.345
You know, Catherine,
I saw what Zach was like

38:50.413 --> 38:53.916
without Gabriella...
you know, who he'd become.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.718
Lost, alone.

38:56.786 --> 38:59.720
I know that's what
I would be like, too...

39:01.824 --> 39:04.525
...without you.

39:18.339 --> 39:20.941
There are a lot
of cops around.

39:22.343 --> 39:24.578
Yeah.

39:24.645 --> 39:26.346
I guess I should
probably go, huh?

39:26.413 --> 39:27.413
Yeah.

39:27.482 --> 39:29.449
Back door...

39:29.517 --> 39:31.517
for now.

39:31.585 --> 39:32.751
For now.

39:32.819 --> 39:33.752
Yeah.

39:45.999 --> 39:48.199
How's Catherine?

39:48.266 --> 39:52.136
Uh, I think she'll be fine,
but I'd keep an eye on her.

39:52.204 --> 39:54.138
Will do.

40:10.354 --> 40:13.056
Nice reunion.

40:13.124 --> 40:14.958
What was the theme?

40:15.026 --> 40:16.226
The apocalypse?

40:16.293 --> 40:18.328
It's a wreck, like my life.

40:18.396 --> 40:20.830
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

40:20.898 --> 40:22.097
You are going
through a lot.

40:22.165 --> 40:26.068
Lost your dad,
dealing with Vincent,

40:26.136 --> 40:27.904
searching for
your birth father.

40:27.971 --> 40:30.105
You'll get there.

40:30.173 --> 40:32.942
What makes you so sure?

40:33.010 --> 40:34.343
You're kidding, right?

40:34.411 --> 40:35.944
Look at where
I've come from.

40:36.012 --> 40:38.279
I used to be a beast, remember?

40:38.347 --> 40:40.815
We all have
something to overcome.

40:42.885 --> 40:44.452
Gabe, don't think
I don't know

40:44.520 --> 40:46.821
how much you've
done to help me.

40:46.889 --> 40:49.524
I so appreciate it.

40:49.592 --> 40:52.026
It's my pleasure,
Catherine.

40:54.930 --> 40:56.830
Me at a track meet.

40:56.898 --> 40:58.098
Hurdler, huh?

40:58.166 --> 41:00.333
Why am I
not surprised?

41:00.401 --> 41:01.835
At graduation.

41:01.903 --> 41:03.103
Look how psyched we are.

41:03.171 --> 41:05.539
Wait.

41:07.875 --> 41:10.610
Why is Agent Reynolds
at my graduation?

41:10.678 --> 41:12.612
Agent Reynolds?

41:26.788 --> 41:29.657
I think I just found
my birth father.
