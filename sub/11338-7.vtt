great show!

01:28.187 --> 01:30.287
Nice job!
beautiful.

01:30.354 --> 01:31.720
Man: just let me--

01:31.787 --> 01:34.620
Hey, uh, look, you're not
allowed to be over there,
all right?

01:34.687 --> 01:35.854
Stay there.

01:36.687 --> 01:37.620

[horns honking]

02:49.520 --> 02:50.454
Aah!

02:50.520 --> 02:53.021
He looked right at me.
did you see that?

02:53.087 --> 02:54.720
I saw it. i saw him
look right at you.

02:54.787 --> 02:56.488
We had a connection.

02:56.553 --> 02:57.820
When he sang "resurrection"

02:57.887 --> 03:00.488
It was like everyone in the
theater just disappeared.

03:00.553 --> 03:01.920
He is so beautiful.

03:01.987 --> 03:02.920
So beautiful.
totally, man.

03:02.987 --> 03:04.154
So beautiful.

03:04.221 --> 03:05.221
This is us.

03:05.287 --> 03:06.221
Both of you?

03:06.287 --> 03:07.520
Yeah.

03:07.587 --> 03:10.321
We live on the same
block, dummy.

03:10.388 --> 03:12.987
I could, uh, walk you
to your building.

03:13.054 --> 03:13.987
What?

03:14.054 --> 03:16.121
I mean, it's--it's dark.

03:16.187 --> 03:17.620
So?

03:17.687 --> 03:18.787
We gotta go.

03:18.854 --> 03:20.488
I'm just saying, it's dark.
i could walk you--

03:20.553 --> 03:24.154
I'm pretty sure i'm
tougher than you are, ted.

03:24.221 --> 03:27.488
[both laughing]

03:27.553 --> 03:30.687
Thank you for taking us to
the concert, though, ted.

03:30.754 --> 03:32.187
Yeah. bye!

03:32.254 --> 03:33.187
[laughing]

03:33.254 --> 03:34.121
Bye-bye.

03:34.187 --> 03:37.154
It's ed, not ted.

Oh!

04:14.587 --> 04:16.488
Ohh! [gasping]

04:23.287 --> 04:25.287
The latest victim
is tara farris, 20.

04:25.354 --> 04:27.821
She's the third victim
in 2 weeks.

04:27.887 --> 04:29.954
All found on freeway
off-ramps by commuters.

04:30.021 --> 04:31.220
Well, he's not hiding them.

04:31.287 --> 04:33.120
An l.a. freeway
during morning rush hour?

04:33.187 --> 04:35.054
He wants them found.

04:35.120 --> 04:35.954
Quickly.

04:36.021 --> 04:38.153
Well, they're still dressed.

04:38.220 --> 04:39.621
That minimizes
the shock value.

04:39.687 --> 04:40.954
Reid: maybe he's
concerned for them.

04:41.021 --> 04:42.354
Think he wants them
taken care of?

04:42.420 --> 04:45.054
No signs of sexual assault
on any of the victims.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.721
Look how pale she is.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.354
All of them were severely
hypovolemic.

04:48.420 --> 04:51.120
Tara had less than a pint
of blood in her.

04:51.187 --> 04:53.454
Look at this. the first 2
had more than 3 pints each.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.054
If exsanguination
is the goal,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.120
The unsub is definitely
becoming more proficient.

04:57.187 --> 05:00.253
This is new.
tara's the only victim
to have a written message.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.287
Hotch: "the liar."

05:01.354 --> 05:02.120
"the" liar.

05:02.187 --> 05:03.654
That's strange, isn't it?

05:03.721 --> 05:06.220
Not a liar or just liar.

05:06.287 --> 05:09.153
So what did you lie about, tara?

05:09.220 --> 05:11.587
All of the victims appear
to have been strangled

05:11.654 --> 05:14.854
And then bled out
through identical wounds
in the throat.

05:14.921 --> 05:18.220
Wait--seriously,
are those supposed
to be fang marks?

05:18.287 --> 05:21.021
All of the wounds
on the victims
were covered in saliva.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.054
Human saliva,
as though--

05:23.120 --> 05:25.454
Someone drank their blood.

Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

06:07.204 --> 06:10.003
Reid: in
the darkest pages
of the malign supernatural,

06:10.220 --> 06:13.821
There is no more terrible
tradition than
that of the vampire.

06:13.887 --> 06:16.021
A pariah even among demons.

06:16.088 --> 06:18.520
Writer montague summers.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.787
Jj: ok. ok, thanks.

06:19.854 --> 06:22.187
So they've already set up
a task force in los angeles.

06:22.253 --> 06:23.988
This isn't their first
serial case.

06:24.054 --> 06:25.721
You remember
detective owen kim?

06:25.787 --> 06:26.787
From the stalker case.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.153
You remember that case,
don't you, spence?

06:29.220 --> 06:31.454
I do remember that case.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.187
Yeah, you ever talk to, um,
lila anymore?

06:34.253 --> 06:36.621
You know, i think
we should probably focus
on this case right now.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.821
It's a little more
pertinent.

06:39.887 --> 06:42.021
All right, so tell us about
blood-drinkers, reid.

06:42.088 --> 06:43.787
Human blood consumption,
or clinical vampirism,

06:43.854 --> 06:45.754
Is known as renfield's syndrome,

06:45.821 --> 06:49.687
Named after the insect-eating
character in bram stoker's
novel "dracula."

06:49.754 --> 06:50.754
Are they sadists?

06:50.821 --> 06:52.520
Not necessarily.
pain to the victim

06:52.587 --> 06:54.320
Is usually only a byproduct.

06:54.387 --> 06:55.587
Blood is the focus.

06:55.654 --> 06:57.654
Renfield's syndrome is usually
accompanied by

06:57.721 --> 06:59.153
Varying levels
of schizophrenia

06:59.220 --> 07:01.220
And occasionally
more classic cannibalism

07:01.287 --> 07:02.654
If the condition evolves.

07:02.721 --> 07:04.153
Classic cannibalism.

07:04.220 --> 07:05.687
Lovely job we have.

07:05.754 --> 07:06.787
I will say this--

07:06.854 --> 07:08.754
True cases are
exceedingly rare.

07:08.821 --> 07:11.054
That's comforting.
sort of.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.554
Renfield's may be rare,

07:12.621 --> 07:13.921
But vampires
are anything but.

07:13.988 --> 07:15.821
And there's a huge
subculture in los angeles

07:15.887 --> 07:17.487
Of the red-drinking undead.

07:17.554 --> 07:19.153
Why is that not a surprise?

07:21.187 --> 07:22.854
Garcia, all these people
drink blood?

07:22.921 --> 07:25.854
Au contraire. they mostly
just dress up like prentiss
did in high school

07:25.921 --> 07:27.587
And they make believe.
it's all kinds of delicious.

07:27.654 --> 07:29.654
It's not the same thing
at all. as a matter of fact,

07:29.721 --> 07:33.220
We should refer to this unsub
as a vampirist, not a vampire.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.054
And they would be attracted
to the subculture

07:35.120 --> 07:36.921
Merely for its professed
worship of blood.

07:36.988 --> 07:40.320
Ok, i'm going to continue
spelunking through
the various online sites,

07:40.387 --> 07:41.854
See if anything jumps up
and bites me.

07:41.921 --> 07:43.721
Thanks, baby g--

07:43.787 --> 07:46.153
Thanks, penelope.
stay close.

07:46.220 --> 07:47.287
Yes, sir.

07:47.354 --> 07:48.988
Garcia out.

07:49.054 --> 07:51.654
You guys, one more thing--
vampirists are coveters.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.921
They most generally always
have some sort of relationship

07:53.988 --> 07:55.854
With the victim,
even if it's tangential.

07:55.921 --> 07:57.787
And they're likely
to become obsessed.

07:57.854 --> 08:00.287
They've almost certainly
crossed paths in some way.

08:37.921 --> 08:38.787
Whoa.

08:38.854 --> 08:40.754
It's ok. it's just me.
it's ray.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.187
You still in bed?

08:42.253 --> 08:43.721
I'm sick.

08:43.787 --> 08:46.187
Look, dante,
you're already late.

08:46.253 --> 08:47.587
Don't call me that.

08:47.654 --> 08:49.320
Sorry, but, man,
you gotta get going, ok?

08:49.387 --> 08:52.454
I said no.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.153
The record company
is gonna be pissed again

08:54.220 --> 08:55.988
Get out!
if you're not--

08:56.054 --> 08:58.387
I know you hate these parties,

08:58.454 --> 09:00.287
But you've got to sell
the record.

09:00.354 --> 09:02.088
You can't blow this off.

09:02.187 --> 09:03.420
It's your job, man.

09:03.487 --> 09:06.054
And it's my job
to make you go.

09:07.554 --> 09:10.153
[sighs] do i have
to be him?

09:10.220 --> 09:12.754
You know that you do.

09:12.821 --> 09:15.054
I'll be down in 20 minutes.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.387
Great. i'll make you
something to eat.

09:18.454 --> 09:20.621
I'm not hungry.

09:24.054 --> 09:25.654
What happened to you
last night?

09:25.721 --> 09:26.988
What do you mean?

09:27.054 --> 09:29.520
After the show.
you just kind of disappeared.

09:29.587 --> 09:31.220
I don't remember.

09:33.387 --> 09:37.187
[overlapping chatter,
telephones ringing]

09:42.654 --> 09:44.320
Hi, lieutenant kim.
agent jareau.

09:44.387 --> 09:47.021
Jj, of course.

09:50.088 --> 09:51.153

09:51.220 --> 09:53.021
Welcome back
to the left coast.

09:53.088 --> 09:54.088
These are agents
prentiss and rossi.

09:54.153 --> 09:55.687
I believe they're
new to you.

09:55.754 --> 09:57.487
Hi. pleasure.

09:57.554 --> 09:58.787
We already have a room set up

09:58.854 --> 10:00.287
Full of glass boards,
case files,

10:00.354 --> 10:02.088
And extremely bad coffee.

10:02.153 --> 10:04.420
Prentiss: we've worked
with a lot less.

10:04.487 --> 10:07.354
Agent morgan's in charge
now. it's his show.

10:09.021 --> 10:11.420
Long story.

10:12.721 --> 10:14.721
I know you like to start
with the freshest information

10:14.787 --> 10:16.587
And work your way back.

10:16.654 --> 10:18.654
So tara's apartment has been
processed and sealed

10:18.721 --> 10:20.054
In case you want to go there.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.854
And her body, along with
that of the first 2 girls,

10:21.921 --> 10:24.687
Is at the morgue with an m.e.
waiting there for your call.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.887
All right.
jj, get set up here,

10:26.954 --> 10:28.387
And then hook up
with garcia.

10:28.454 --> 10:29.887
Send her the witness
information

10:29.954 --> 10:32.253
So she can start
cross-referencing
with the first 2 victims.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.587
Reid, i want you to go
through all the case files,

10:34.654 --> 10:36.088
Set up a preliminary
profile based on

10:36.153 --> 10:37.787
What you already know
about the psychopathology.

10:37.854 --> 10:41.754
And the rest of us, let's
find out what we can on tara.

10:41.821 --> 10:46.320
[loud music playing]

10:50.954 --> 10:54.287

11:02.587 --> 11:05.320
[crowd chanting "dante! dante!"]

11:43.088 --> 11:45.554
So we're looking
for a connection

11:45.621 --> 11:46.887
Between
the witnesses.

11:46.954 --> 11:47.921
When vampirists become obsessed,

11:47.988 --> 11:50.088
They aren't likely to find
a random victim.

11:50.153 --> 11:51.654
If we can find
a cross-relationship,

11:51.721 --> 11:53.253
Someone in all
the victims' lives,

11:53.320 --> 11:54.754
That'll be incredibly helpful.

11:54.821 --> 11:56.787
Gina king knew tara
the longest.

11:56.854 --> 11:58.387
They apparently had
some classes together.

11:58.454 --> 12:00.287
Let's get all the information
we can on that relationship.

12:00.354 --> 12:02.954
As a matter of fact,
get me everything you can
on all of tara's friends.

12:03.021 --> 12:06.021
All right. in the morning
i'll track them down
and do some follow-up.

12:06.088 --> 12:07.454
That's fine.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.854
[dante's music playing]

12:19.153 --> 12:22.554
He's writing a story
on artists who cross over--

12:22.621 --> 12:26.988
Cross over. is that
what i do, jeff from
"metal life"?

12:27.054 --> 12:30.153
I guess, kind of.
you're not totally goth, right?

12:30.220 --> 12:32.088
That whole vampire thing
you do is--

12:32.153 --> 12:34.554
Ah, the vampire
thing?

12:34.621 --> 12:37.520
Yeah, your act.
it appeals to
certain people.

12:37.587 --> 12:39.887
It appeals to desperate,
sad people

12:39.954 --> 12:44.420
With, at best, a tenuous
hold on reality.

12:46.454 --> 12:47.988
Wow. can i quote you on that?

12:48.054 --> 12:51.954
Sure. knock yourself out.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.420
No, don't use
that quote.

12:54.487 --> 12:57.287
'cause i can just
get him back,
get another--

12:57.354 --> 12:59.787
You know what,
don't even bother, man.
he was old news 5 years ago.

My mom wanted me

to make it, so...

I waitressed on
the weekends to swing it.

13:28.787 --> 13:30.387
You must have been
a hell of a waitress

13:30.454 --> 13:32.088
To swing an apartment
in georgetown.

13:32.153 --> 13:33.721
No, i sucked.

13:33.787 --> 13:36.988
I only got by 'cause my mom
put money in my account
every week

13:37.054 --> 13:38.887
And we both pretended
i didn't know.

13:38.954 --> 13:42.821
Looks like she was
studying to make movies.

13:44.287 --> 13:46.253
Rossi.

13:55.554 --> 13:57.454
Who is this guy?

14:05.153 --> 14:06.354
Ah.

14:06.420 --> 14:09.021
Well, if you want to look into
a young girl's life today,

14:09.088 --> 14:12.354
You have to access her myspace,
facebook, and twitter accounts.

14:12.420 --> 14:15.320
I'll call the sexiest
hacker on the planet.

14:16.487 --> 14:19.787
[dante's music playing]

14:19.854 --> 14:23.454
[lyrics indistinct]

14:32.054 --> 14:34.587
I don't think he's
going to print that quote.

14:34.654 --> 14:35.821
Who cares?

14:35.887 --> 14:39.187
You shouldn't say
stuff like that
about your fans.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.587
Maybe i'll just jump off.

14:40.654 --> 14:43.387
I mean, i'm a vampire.

14:43.454 --> 14:45.088
Maybe i could just fly away.

14:45.153 --> 14:47.187
I don't like
that kind of talk.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.621
What's wrong, ray,

14:48.687 --> 14:50.587
Afraid you're gonna lose
your cash cow?

14:50.654 --> 14:53.887
What's happened to you?

14:53.954 --> 14:55.320
It doesn't matter.

14:55.387 --> 14:57.320
Come on. we used to
have fun, remember?

14:57.387 --> 14:59.253
I don't make music anymore.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.821
I make events.

15:00.887 --> 15:02.153
I play a character.

15:02.220 --> 15:04.320
You sell records.

15:04.387 --> 15:08.554
It's not as if i
exactly light up the sales
charts anymore, anyway.

15:08.621 --> 15:10.153
You'll sell again.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.287
Ray, you may be the only
friend i have left,

15:12.354 --> 15:15.088
But...you're a pretty
crappy liar.

15:17.454 --> 15:20.187
Ohh! i'm so sorry!

15:20.253 --> 15:21.621
It's my fault.
it's my fault.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.220
Let me help you.

15:24.287 --> 15:26.854
Wow. interesting hand.

15:28.621 --> 15:29.988
Do you know who i am?

15:30.054 --> 15:33.554
Yeah. i mean,
you're the music guy.

15:33.621 --> 15:35.454
This is your party, right?

15:35.520 --> 15:39.021
Yes. this is--
this is for me, but...

15:39.088 --> 15:42.021
I have a pocket full of
what will make us both

15:42.088 --> 15:44.887
Feel so much happier.

15:44.954 --> 15:45.954
You do?

15:46.021 --> 15:47.587
So let's get
out of here.

15:47.654 --> 15:48.721
Really?

15:48.787 --> 15:52.821
Yeah. come on, let's go.
you won't be sorry.

15:53.854 --> 15:56.153
The saliva hasn't been
dna i.d.'d,

15:56.220 --> 15:58.187
But we have it
going through the lab.

15:58.253 --> 16:00.487
You can have the samples sent
over to the local bureau lab

16:00.554 --> 16:01.654
And have them rush it.

16:01.721 --> 16:03.621
You should have something
by sometime tomorrow.

16:03.687 --> 16:06.387
I'll have it sent
right over.

16:06.454 --> 16:07.554
They're not bites.

16:07.621 --> 16:10.454
Look at the edges.
they're razor sharp.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.320
A tooth would leave
a ragged, torn edge.

16:12.387 --> 16:14.220
I have some photos
of animal bites
on the table

16:14.287 --> 16:16.153
For comparison.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.187
Some sort of boring
instrument, then?

16:18.253 --> 16:19.821
Very sharp
and very efficient.

16:19.887 --> 16:22.253
Well, if it isn't a bite,
then the saliva,

16:22.320 --> 16:24.854
Is it from licking, afterwards?

16:24.921 --> 16:28.120
Maybe. i haven't seen
anything like it.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.754
Once an unsub like this
gets started...

16:32.821 --> 16:35.088
It only gets worse.

16:51.988 --> 16:53.520
This is chase manning,
news chopper 12,

16:53.587 --> 16:56.354
Over the 101 freeway
in the san fernando valley.

16:56.420 --> 16:58.354
Apparently a second
body in as many days

16:58.420 --> 17:00.354
Has been found
near an off-ramp.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.954
So much for keeping
the media out.

17:03.021 --> 17:04.988
Penelope?

17:05.054 --> 17:05.988
Are we in yet?

17:06.054 --> 17:07.621
All yours.

17:07.686 --> 17:10.587
[sighs] i always feel skeevy
going through someone's life
like this.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.387
Ok, so everything
looks like it's
password protected,

17:13.454 --> 17:15.587
So you might not
even be able to--

17:15.654 --> 17:17.354
You're in already,
aren't you?

17:17.420 --> 17:18.820
The password was cullen.

17:18.887 --> 17:19.820
Of course.

17:19.887 --> 17:20.820
Colon?

17:20.887 --> 17:22.220
Cullen.

17:22.287 --> 17:24.119
The vampire family
from "twilight."

17:24.186 --> 17:25.454
What's "twilight"?

17:25.520 --> 17:28.354
Do you ever read anything
other than technical books?

17:28.420 --> 17:30.253
Not much in english.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.887
Ok, i'll see
what i can dredge.

17:31.954 --> 17:33.120
My love is strong.

17:33.187 --> 17:34.554
Ok, thanks.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.988
How's
the profile coming?

17:36.054 --> 17:37.921
I don't know. i never
really feel ready, you know?

17:37.988 --> 17:39.153
It'll be fine.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.887
I am gonna go talk
to tara's bff

17:40.954 --> 17:42.988
Before the media
requests come in
and it gets too crazy.

17:43.054 --> 17:44.554
What's a bff?

17:44.621 --> 17:46.587
[sighs] best friend forever.

17:46.654 --> 17:47.887
Should i go with you?

17:47.954 --> 17:50.120
No. you have a profile
to deliver.

17:50.187 --> 17:52.120
I should really work on it
a little more.

17:52.187 --> 17:53.887
Reid.

17:53.954 --> 17:56.721
What are you doing
with my phone?

17:56.787 --> 17:59.220
Derek, hey, um,

17:59.287 --> 18:01.687
Spence is ready
for the profile.

18:01.754 --> 18:03.587
Why, yes, he is,
right here.

18:03.654 --> 18:06.520
I'll be back.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.220
Hey.

18:14.021 --> 18:17.320
All right, reid.
we'll be right in.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.021
Hotch, reid's ready
with the profile.

18:20.088 --> 18:21.387
Good.

18:21.454 --> 18:23.887
Highway crew found her
just as the sun
was coming up.

18:23.954 --> 18:26.721
How long's
she been here?

18:26.787 --> 18:28.454
Barely even cold yet.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.187
Hour, maybe.
prentiss: the liar.

18:30.253 --> 18:31.454
The same message.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.587
Apparently it wasn't
tara-specific.

18:34.654 --> 18:36.354
I wonder what it means,
then.

18:36.420 --> 18:38.587
Rossi: the first victim
on a consecutive day.

18:38.654 --> 18:40.454
Detective kim,
can you have
your crime scene techs

18:40.520 --> 18:41.787
Keep us apprised
of the processing?

18:41.854 --> 18:43.354
We're ready with
a preliminary profile.

18:43.420 --> 18:44.587
That's quick.

18:44.654 --> 18:46.621
So's this unsub.

18:50.253 --> 18:52.220
Reid: we aren't looking
for a vampire

18:52.287 --> 18:54.721
In the supernatural sense,
only in the sense

18:54.787 --> 18:56.921
That this unsub
has a very strong desire,

18:56.988 --> 18:58.520
A need, for human blood.

18:58.587 --> 19:01.220
Now, fortunately,
vampirists display
several characteristics

19:01.287 --> 19:03.287
Which will be helpful
in finding him.

19:03.354 --> 19:05.487
He will have cut himself
repeatedly.

19:05.554 --> 19:07.120
It's called auto-vampirism,

19:07.187 --> 19:08.654
Essentially becoming
his own first victim.

19:08.721 --> 19:11.621
It's the way by which
he first tasted human blood.

19:11.687 --> 19:14.253
Most vampirists are
incredibly ashamed of this

19:14.320 --> 19:16.721
And will wear long-sleeved
shirts in order to conceal it.

19:16.787 --> 19:19.520
Secondly, there will be
a long history of animal abuse,

19:19.587 --> 19:22.120
Starting with smaller animals
such as insects and rodents

19:22.187 --> 19:24.420
And then working his way up
to larger things--

19:24.487 --> 19:25.554
Dogs and cats.

19:25.621 --> 19:27.220
Though this is
a well-recognized component

19:27.287 --> 19:29.988
Of the homicidal triad
seen in other serial killers,

19:30.054 --> 19:32.220
In the case of the vampirist,
it's more pronounced.

19:32.287 --> 19:33.721
There will,
interestingly enough,

19:33.787 --> 19:37.287
Not be any animal torture,
as with other psychopathologies.

19:37.354 --> 19:41.153
The killing isn't the point,
it's merely a means by which
to obtain the blood.

19:41.220 --> 19:44.054
Look hard at your animal
control sections records,

19:44.120 --> 19:45.621
As far back as you can.

19:45.687 --> 19:47.887
They will probably have
some record of this unsub
as an adolescent.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.787
This guy also
most likely lives

19:49.854 --> 19:51.587
In a poorly kept
older home.

19:51.654 --> 19:54.954
Rossi: he needs a house
for the privacy,
not an apartment.

19:55.021 --> 19:57.854
It takes some time
to drain a body
completely of blood.

19:57.921 --> 19:59.520
Uninterrupted time.

19:59.587 --> 20:02.988
This unsub also
most likely lives
with an elderly woman,

20:03.054 --> 20:04.153
A grandmother, a mother,

20:04.220 --> 20:05.420
Even an aunt.

20:05.487 --> 20:06.487
How could you know that?

20:06.554 --> 20:07.921
Prentiss: this type
of mental illness,

20:07.988 --> 20:09.787
Accompanied by extreme
schizophrenia,

20:09.854 --> 20:12.088
Dominates a family's
entire existence.

20:12.153 --> 20:14.887
It often leads
to a broken home,

20:14.954 --> 20:16.921
And a woman ends up
as primary caregiver.

20:16.988 --> 20:18.253
Hotch: the men
generally leave.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.487
Reid:
oh, and one more thing.

20:19.554 --> 20:22.187
This type of disorder
cannot be hidden
for long.

20:22.253 --> 20:23.587
I guarantee you
someone out there

20:23.654 --> 20:25.687
Already knows this unsub
is very, very sick.

20:25.754 --> 20:27.988
[vomiting]

20:28.054 --> 20:31.120
You ok?
you all right?

20:31.187 --> 20:32.387
Should i--should i
call somebody?

20:32.454 --> 20:34.787
Tell me what's
happening. talk to me.

20:34.854 --> 20:36.120
Talk to me.

20:36.187 --> 20:37.454
Oh, my god.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.120
I can't stop it.

20:39.187 --> 20:40.954
[breathing hard]

20:41.021 --> 20:41.954
I want to.

20:42.021 --> 20:43.387
Yeah.

20:43.454 --> 20:44.954
But i can't stop it.

20:45.021 --> 20:46.420
[gasping]
you gotta help me.

20:46.487 --> 20:47.687
I know. i will.

20:47.754 --> 20:48.787
You gotta help me.

20:48.854 --> 20:49.787
I will.

20:49.854 --> 20:51.587
Are you
all right?

20:51.654 --> 20:53.320
Talk to me.
i can't stop it.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.721
Come here.

20:58.187 --> 21:00.220
We're gonna fix this, ok?

21:00.287 --> 21:02.988
I'm gonna fix this.

21:04.354 --> 21:07.487
Agent morgan,
we've identified
this morning's victim.

21:07.554 --> 21:08.854
Erin hickman.

21:08.921 --> 21:10.320
She worked for a caterer
at an event last night.

21:10.387 --> 21:12.454
They're still there
cleaning up.

21:22.287 --> 21:24.320
Where can i find
ms. masters?

21:24.387 --> 21:25.387
She's right there.

21:25.454 --> 21:27.887
Thank you.

21:27.954 --> 21:28.921
Excuse me. ms. masters?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.554
I'm lieutenant kim, lapd.

21:30.621 --> 21:31.988
Is this about erin?

21:32.054 --> 21:33.054
Yes, ma'am.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.687
Is she really dead?

21:34.754 --> 21:36.387
Yes, ma'am.
i'm sorry.

21:36.454 --> 21:39.021
These are fbi agents
morgan and prentiss.

21:39.088 --> 21:40.021
Fbi?

21:40.088 --> 21:41.088
Erin hickman work for you?

21:41.153 --> 21:42.520
Well, till last night.
she walked out on me

21:42.587 --> 21:43.887
In the middle
of the party.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.887
Walked out?
all i know

21:45.954 --> 21:47.687
Is she was here
one minute
and gone the next.

21:47.754 --> 21:49.821
Was it uncommon for her
to be irresponsible?

21:49.887 --> 21:53.554
Look, i don't want to
speak ill of the--

21:53.621 --> 21:55.021
She had a problem
with drugs.

21:55.088 --> 21:57.687
Excuse me.

21:57.754 --> 21:59.120
Morgan.

21:59.187 --> 22:03.654
We saw a poster of him
in tara's house.

22:06.454 --> 22:07.520
[beep]

22:07.587 --> 22:08.554
Speak to me, vision.

22:08.621 --> 22:10.088
Garcia, give me everything
you've got

22:10.187 --> 22:11.721
On a singer named dante.

22:11.787 --> 22:13.520
Dante, the vampire guy?
i was just about to
call you.

22:13.587 --> 22:14.954
You know him?

22:15.021 --> 22:17.520
Uh, he's the one thing
that all of our victims
have in common.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.253
What do you mean?

22:19.320 --> 22:21.287
They have cyber shrines
set up for this guy.

22:21.354 --> 22:23.988
They worship him.
they're obsessed
with his music.

22:24.054 --> 22:27.454
Well, his new album
comes out today
and it's called "the liar."

22:27.520 --> 22:29.787
"the liar," i know.
and isn't that what was
written on them?

22:29.854 --> 22:31.120
Uh-huh.

22:31.187 --> 22:32.754
Ok, uh, all of our victims,

22:32.821 --> 22:34.621
Including the first two,
were diehard fans.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.054
Tara and gina--
that's tara's friend--

22:36.120 --> 22:38.587
They were practically
running his fan club.

22:38.654 --> 22:40.287
What about erin hickman,
our latest victim?

22:40.354 --> 22:42.420
Erin hickman--i haven't
run across that name.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.253
Ok, we need to talk
to this dante guy.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.754
Garcia, can you get us
an address?

22:45.821 --> 22:47.253
That's gonna take
a little while.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.687
These celebrities
are protected by
layers of privacy.

22:49.754 --> 22:51.721
It's like finding
information
on a deeply--

22:51.787 --> 22:54.887
Garcia: 22423 greenvale circle,

22:54.954 --> 22:57.887
Holmby hills. gps coordinates
are uploading to you now.

22:57.954 --> 23:00.287
And his name is
paul davies, by the way.

23:00.354 --> 23:02.220
Run him for a criminal
record, too.

23:02.287 --> 23:03.220
You got it.

23:03.287 --> 23:04.520
Thanks, p.g.

23:04.587 --> 23:06.854
I'd hate to think
what she could
find out about me.

23:06.921 --> 23:10.487
Oh, i prefer
not even to consider it.

23:11.654 --> 23:14.420
It doesn't look like
a lot of poorly maintained

23:14.487 --> 23:15.587
Single-family homes.

23:15.654 --> 23:16.854
No.

23:16.921 --> 23:18.253
I hate to ask this,

23:18.320 --> 23:20.854
But are your profiles
this far off sometimes?

23:20.921 --> 23:22.120
They haven't been yet.

23:22.187 --> 23:23.821
This probably
isn't our unsub,

23:23.887 --> 23:25.854
Just a piece
of the puzzle.

23:25.921 --> 23:27.520
Whoa.

23:32.187 --> 23:33.954
I could get used to this.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.454
This is definitely
not poorly maintained.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.621
One of these things
does not belong.

23:52.021 --> 23:54.220
Hey, garcia, can you
run a plate for me?

23:54.287 --> 23:55.687
This isn't
our guy, is it?

23:55.754 --> 23:56.921
I highly doubt it.

23:57.754 --> 23:59.187
May i help you guys?

23:59.253 --> 24:00.787
Dante?

24:00.854 --> 24:02.054
No.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.520
You're not the singer?

24:03.587 --> 24:05.854
Dante's not my name.
he's a character i play.

24:05.921 --> 24:07.088
So who are you guys?

24:07.153 --> 24:08.554
We're investigating
a murder--

24:08.621 --> 24:12.287
Sir! would you mind coming in
to answer a few questions?

24:12.354 --> 24:13.287
Prentiss,
what are you doing?

24:13.354 --> 24:14.621
That car is erin hickman's car.

24:14.687 --> 24:15.887
The victim's car.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.554
Would you mind coming in, sir?

24:26.137 --> 24:27.171
this is elizabeth chambers

24:27.237 --> 24:28.371
Outside the los angeles
police department

24:28.437 --> 24:29.937
With a story
we're still developing.

24:30.004 --> 24:31.904
The singer-songwriter
known as dante

24:31.970 --> 24:34.070
Has been taken into custody
by the fbi

24:34.137 --> 24:35.937
As a suspect in a recent
string of murders

24:36.004 --> 24:37.638
In the los angeles area.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.638
[reporters all shouting
at once]

24:42.703 --> 24:44.171
Dante!
dante!

24:44.237 --> 24:46.670
What's it been, 30 minutes?

24:46.737 --> 24:48.803
[all shouting]

24:50.837 --> 24:52.670
What about your music?

24:52.737 --> 24:55.070
Welcome to the media
capital of the world.

24:55.137 --> 24:56.504
Oh, god.

24:56.571 --> 24:58.337
How the hell did they
get here so fast?

24:58.404 --> 24:59.670
Who knows? they always do.

24:59.737 --> 25:02.237
Now listen up.
we're gonna have
to push through.

25:02.304 --> 25:04.004
Can you at least put a jacket
over me or something?

25:04.070 --> 25:06.471
Do you have anything
you want to say?!

25:06.538 --> 25:08.204
If we're gonna go
we gotta go now.

25:08.271 --> 25:10.770
[all shouting]

25:12.437 --> 25:14.271
Back off!

25:14.337 --> 25:15.837
Everyone back off!

25:15.904 --> 25:16.970
Back off!

25:17.037 --> 25:19.271
[shouting]

25:19.337 --> 25:21.137
Back up, please! back up!

25:21.204 --> 25:23.437
Back up!

25:27.371 --> 25:29.437
I'm with the fbi!

25:29.504 --> 25:30.703
I have an official statement

25:30.770 --> 25:32.271
If you'll just
come over here, please.

25:32.337 --> 25:33.571
Is he gonna be ok?

25:33.638 --> 25:35.937
He's got a gun.
keep moving.

25:36.004 --> 25:38.638
Right in here.
thank you very much.

25:38.703 --> 25:42.703
Ok, this is just a preliminary
investigation right now.

25:43.770 --> 25:46.703
A lot of this
doesn't add up.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.638
Hotch: we've been wrong before.

25:48.703 --> 25:49.537
Not this much.

25:50.371 --> 25:51.737
The plot thickens.

25:51.803 --> 25:54.870
He was arrested
for domestic violence
10 years ago.

25:54.937 --> 25:56.504
How bad?

25:56.571 --> 25:58.571
Well, garcia was able
to find the battery charge,

25:58.638 --> 26:00.970
But it was expunged,
so who knows?

26:01.037 --> 26:02.337
Again, welcome to
celebrity justice.

26:02.404 --> 26:03.870
He's pretty agitated.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.304
Hotch: i wonder why.

26:05.371 --> 26:07.703
Celebrities out here
aren't used to being
put in the box.

26:07.770 --> 26:09.404
Morgan: this seems
more than that, though.

26:09.471 --> 26:10.803
I don't know.
these are people

26:10.870 --> 26:13.437
Everyone falls down
around, defers to.

26:13.504 --> 26:14.970
Adulation is their norm.

26:15.037 --> 26:17.204
You know, prentiss,
that may be a good way
for you to play him.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.404
Me?

26:18.471 --> 26:19.737
You were the one
who pointed at him.

26:19.803 --> 26:22.304
He may see you
as an adversary.
have him off-guard.

26:24.504 --> 26:26.604
So, what did you
tell the press?

26:26.670 --> 26:29.037
My official statement
was that i hate
los angeles.

26:29.104 --> 26:30.237
What's happening?

26:30.304 --> 26:31.870
Prentiss is gonna
take the lead.

26:31.937 --> 26:33.271
Rossi: good choice.

26:33.337 --> 26:34.471
Remember,
if he is the unsub,

26:34.538 --> 26:35.670
He's ashamed
of the disorder,

26:35.737 --> 26:36.837
So use that
to your advantage.

26:36.904 --> 26:38.337
Hotch: tell him
you can't believe

26:38.404 --> 26:39.904
That someone like him
could do this.

26:39.970 --> 26:41.538
Right.
throw him a lifeline.

26:41.604 --> 26:42.937
Morgan: ask him
for his autograph.

26:43.004 --> 26:45.304
[laughs]

26:45.371 --> 26:46.937
Oh. right. right.

26:47.004 --> 26:48.638
Adulation.

26:49.937 --> 26:53.538
Mr. davies.
have a seat, relax.

26:53.604 --> 26:54.737
Relax?

26:54.803 --> 26:56.737
How the hell am i
supposed to relax?

26:56.803 --> 26:58.004
Please sit.

26:58.070 --> 27:00.237
I've been trying
to call my manager,

27:00.304 --> 27:02.171
But i can't get
a signal.

27:02.237 --> 27:05.504
These interrogation rooms
don't usually have
cell service.

27:05.571 --> 27:07.104
Is there another phone
that i can use?

27:07.171 --> 27:10.703
I--i think there's been
a really big mistake.

27:10.770 --> 27:12.404
There's been no mistake.

27:12.471 --> 27:17.104
I'm sure that you couldn't
have had anything to do
with what's happened.

27:17.171 --> 27:20.638
Really? i mean, you're the one
that brought me in here.

27:20.703 --> 27:23.371
The police gave me
some bad information.

27:23.437 --> 27:24.670
You're not
the police?

27:24.737 --> 27:26.237
Good, she's confusing him.

27:26.304 --> 27:27.870
Schizophrenics
can't follow that.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.837
Neither one of us
is the type of person

27:29.904 --> 27:33.104
Who belongs in
a police interrogation room.

27:33.171 --> 27:35.970
Supervisory special agent
emily prentiss,

27:36.037 --> 27:37.638
Federal bureau
of investigation.

27:37.703 --> 27:39.004
Fbi?

27:39.070 --> 27:43.571
And, of course,
i know who you are.

27:43.638 --> 27:46.638
I'm a big fan.

27:46.703 --> 27:48.371
Really?

27:48.437 --> 27:50.471
[laughs]
does that surprise you?

27:50.538 --> 27:52.904
Yeah. yeah, that's a surprise.

27:52.970 --> 27:57.638
Ok. well,
before we get started...

27:57.703 --> 27:59.737
Would you mind?

28:01.237 --> 28:02.970
Would i mind what?

28:03.037 --> 28:04.670
Well, i hate to ask,

28:04.737 --> 28:07.970
But i don't usually get
opportunities like this.

28:08.037 --> 28:11.237
What the hell is this?
you're no fan of mine.

28:11.304 --> 28:13.870
You people think
i'm stupid.

28:13.937 --> 28:16.937
That kind of contradiction
should completely confuse
a schizophrenic.

28:17.004 --> 28:18.504
They can't make sense of it.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.638
Am i suspected
of something?

28:20.703 --> 28:22.904
What's the name
of your new album,

28:22.970 --> 28:25.571
The one that
comes out today?

28:26.770 --> 28:28.638
Is she--

28:28.703 --> 28:30.070
Dead? yes.

28:30.137 --> 28:32.571
With the name
of your new album
written on her.

28:32.638 --> 28:34.803
It's a common phrase.

28:34.870 --> 28:37.737
Is it? it seems
a little odd to me.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.070
The instead of a.

28:39.137 --> 28:42.904
And this girl went home
with you last night.

28:45.371 --> 28:46.970
She's dead?

28:48.803 --> 28:50.870
Can you explain that?

28:53.204 --> 28:55.571
I--i don't--

28:56.904 --> 28:58.004
I don't remember.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.571
You don't remember
hurting her?

28:59.638 --> 29:03.104
No. no.

29:04.770 --> 29:07.870
Their blood was drained.

29:07.937 --> 29:10.271
From holes
in their throats.

29:10.337 --> 29:11.703
What?

29:11.770 --> 29:14.770
Are you a vampire,
mr. davies?

29:14.837 --> 29:16.471
You can't be serious.

29:16.538 --> 29:19.037
It's a character i play,
a stage act.

29:19.104 --> 29:21.337
You know, sometimes
things get out of hand.

29:21.404 --> 29:22.371
No, no.

29:22.437 --> 29:25.004
This is--this is crazy.

29:25.070 --> 29:29.171
I don't know how that girl
ended up like that.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.870
I think i need my manager here.

29:34.937 --> 29:37.104
You're gonna do this
all on your own,

29:37.171 --> 29:38.404
Just like a big boy.

29:38.471 --> 29:41.337
But i have the right
to a lawyer.

29:41.404 --> 29:42.937
Are you asking
for an attorney?

29:43.004 --> 29:46.803
No. i'm asking to speak
to my manager

29:46.870 --> 29:48.304
So he can find one.

29:51.770 --> 29:53.104
I need a phone.

29:53.171 --> 29:55.204
I need to make a call.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.803
I need to make a call.

29:59.770 --> 30:02.271
[cell phone rings]
there's nothing you can do
when they lawyer up, prentiss.

30:02.337 --> 30:03.337
Dr. reid here.

30:03.404 --> 30:05.538
Spence, what's going on?

30:05.604 --> 30:08.604
The possible suspect's
some sort of rock and roll star.

30:08.670 --> 30:09.770
Seriously?

30:09.837 --> 30:11.437
Yeah. a lot of it doesn't fit
the profile, though.

30:11.504 --> 30:12.437
Anything i can do?

30:12.504 --> 30:14.604
There's a lot
of media attention.

30:14.670 --> 30:16.504
All right. well,
i'm already here
at gina's house,

30:16.571 --> 30:18.371
So let me get some info
and i'll be back.

30:18.437 --> 30:20.137
Great. thank you so much.

30:20.204 --> 30:22.604
None of this
makes any sense.

30:22.670 --> 30:23.604
No.

30:23.670 --> 30:25.104
Television is saying
his new record

30:25.171 --> 30:27.371
Is selling through the roof.
all of his stuff is.

30:27.437 --> 30:30.770
As soon as his being
questioned in an actual
string of murders became public.

30:30.837 --> 30:34.037
What do they say?
any publicity's
good publicity.

30:34.104 --> 30:35.638
What are we gonna
do with him?

30:35.703 --> 30:37.137
[cell phone rings]

30:37.204 --> 30:38.638
Hotchner.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.703
Well, he wants to talk
to his manager,

30:40.770 --> 30:42.137
So maybe we let him
make that call

30:42.204 --> 30:43.638
And find out
what that guy knows.

30:43.703 --> 30:45.337
It's worth a try.

30:48.770 --> 30:50.271
You sure?

30:51.604 --> 30:52.638
Ok, thanks.

30:52.703 --> 30:54.437
That's the lab.
something?

30:54.504 --> 30:56.337
The saliva samples
from the victims' throats--

30:56.404 --> 30:58.104
The dna's from a woman.

31:05.371 --> 31:06.471
Stop. don't to that.

31:06.538 --> 31:08.638
Grandma's asleep.
she's gonna wake up.

31:08.703 --> 31:09.638
So you have to stop it.

31:09.703 --> 31:11.271
I need to go
to the yard.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.703

31:24.070 --> 31:24.304
Gina.

31:26.304 --> 31:27.170
Gina.

31:27.237 --> 31:28.304
I'm with the--

31:28.371 --> 31:30.903
Fbi.

31:38.870 --> 31:41.070
A woman?
that's incredibly rare.

31:41.137 --> 31:42.404
But not impossible.

31:42.471 --> 31:44.471
No, but renfield's with
this type of aggression--

31:44.537 --> 31:45.803
It almost never
presents this way.

31:45.870 --> 31:47.104
Ok, we knew
something was wrong.

31:47.170 --> 31:49.004
Our profiles have never
been this far off, reid.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.471
Go back and work it
with a woman.

31:50.537 --> 31:53.004
See if there's anything
we may have missed.

31:57.204 --> 32:00.304
You wanted to call
your manager.

32:00.371 --> 32:01.504
Can i have some privacy?

32:01.571 --> 32:03.304
That's not how it works.

Holy hell, man, the record's
gone through the roof.

32:17.170 --> 32:18.638
What do you mean?

32:18.704 --> 32:19.837
Yeah, it's flying
off the shelves.

32:19.903 --> 32:22.037
I told you i'd fix it.

32:22.104 --> 32:23.304
I told you.

32:23.371 --> 32:24.537
Yeah, everything's good.

32:24.604 --> 32:25.870
You're gonna be back on top,

right back to normal,

don't worry about it.

32:34.738 --> 32:35.638
Don't worry?

32:35.704 --> 32:37.070
No, don't--don't worry about it.

32:37.137 --> 32:39.638
Look, there's nothing that
could be tied to you,

32:39.704 --> 32:40.903
Absolutely nothing.

32:40.970 --> 32:42.671
It's all good, man.

32:42.738 --> 32:45.638
Come on, let's go. yes.

32:45.704 --> 32:47.638
What did you do, ray?

32:47.704 --> 32:49.738
The less you know about it
the better.

32:49.803 --> 32:51.638
Look, i gotta take care
of this thing,

32:51.704 --> 32:53.704
And then i'll be right back.

32:53.770 --> 32:55.137
I'll be down there.

32:55.204 --> 32:56.404
Let me just fix this.

32:56.471 --> 32:57.404
Ray--

32:57.471 --> 32:58.437
Hey, relax, would ya?

32:58.504 --> 33:00.037
It's gonna be all right.

33:00.104 --> 33:04.604
[beep, dial tone]

33:04.671 --> 33:05.903
[hangs up telephone]

33:08.337 --> 33:11.671
Did he do something?

33:11.738 --> 33:14.104
I don't know.

33:14.170 --> 33:16.337
What did he say?

33:16.404 --> 33:18.137
He said he'd be down
to fix it.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.571
Fix what?

33:22.004 --> 33:23.537
Fix this, i suppose.

33:23.604 --> 33:26.903
But he didn't ask you
what "this" was.

33:28.070 --> 33:30.204
No.

33:31.404 --> 33:34.604
Gina.

33:34.671 --> 33:36.271
Gina.

33:36.337 --> 33:39.070
My name is jennifer jareau.

33:39.137 --> 33:40.738
Gina, where'd you go?

33:51.237 --> 33:52.704
Gina...

33:56.803 --> 33:58.638
Who the hell is that?

34:00.304 --> 34:03.170
What kind of fan mail
do you get, mr. vampire?

34:03.237 --> 34:06.304
A woman--what changes,
what doesn't?

34:06.371 --> 34:08.737
[indistinct]

34:22.603 --> 34:24.937
Older female...

34:30.070 --> 34:31.536
Oh, no.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.504
[cell phone rings]

34:33.571 --> 34:34.504
Yeah.

34:34.571 --> 34:35.704
Uh, reid,

34:35.770 --> 34:38.471
Uh, i found fan mail
to dante.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.504
Vampire fan mail.
it's bananas.

34:40.571 --> 34:41.603
Obsessional?

34:41.670 --> 34:42.737
Ad infinitum and beyond.

34:42.803 --> 34:44.471
Tara's friend gina--

34:44.536 --> 34:46.337
The stuff she writes--

34:46.404 --> 34:49.304
She--he's her god.
a vampire god.

34:49.371 --> 34:52.004
She lives for him.
she said she'll kill for him.

34:52.070 --> 34:53.902
And she fits every other
piece of the profile.

34:53.969 --> 34:55.170
Guys!

34:55.237 --> 34:56.670
The girl tara was with
before she died--

34:56.737 --> 34:58.004
Gina--it's her.

34:58.070 --> 34:59.738
Do you have an address?

34:59.803 --> 35:00.870
Yeah. i think jj
is there right now.

35:00.937 --> 35:02.803
Let's go.

35:03.671 --> 35:05.170
Ray: who the hell is she?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.671
I'm so upset.

35:07.738 --> 35:10.170
It's all going to go bad.

35:10.237 --> 35:12.571
Forget that. you've got--
you've got to kill her.

35:12.638 --> 35:14.371
[cell phone buzzing]

35:14.437 --> 35:15.937
Gina: it's all going bad.

35:16.004 --> 35:17.671
Listen to me,
we've got to help dante.

35:17.738 --> 35:19.504
You gotta help dante again.

35:19.571 --> 35:20.504
Dante?

35:20.571 --> 35:21.671
Yeah.

35:21.738 --> 35:24.137
He's--he's--
he's gonna be angry.

35:24.204 --> 35:26.037
No, no, no, no.
i promise.

35:26.104 --> 35:28.604
He'll only be angry
if you don't kill
this woman.

35:28.671 --> 35:30.437
Listen,

35:30.504 --> 35:32.204
You gotta hurt
one more girl

35:32.271 --> 35:36.337
And then you'll
be able to join him
in the undead. ok?

35:36.404 --> 35:39.738
[echoing]

35:41.803 --> 35:43.170
She isn't answering.

35:43.237 --> 35:44.471
Keep trying.

35:46.437 --> 35:47.903
You don't understand!

35:47.970 --> 35:49.137
I do. i do understand.

35:49.204 --> 35:51.070
You just have to do
one more

35:51.137 --> 35:53.004
And dante will be able
to live then.

35:53.070 --> 35:54.004
Just one?

35:54.070 --> 35:56.004
Just this one more girl

35:56.070 --> 35:59.137
And then you can join
the undead,
just like we promised.

35:59.204 --> 36:02.337
You said that tara
was the last one.

36:02.404 --> 36:03.870
That's what you said.

36:03.937 --> 36:06.304
You said.
now it's the other girl--

36:06.371 --> 36:07.671
This is the last one.

36:07.738 --> 36:08.903
The last one
that you have to do,

36:08.970 --> 36:11.770
And then you can join dante
and be the undead.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.271
Just like we talked about,
remember? remember?

36:14.337 --> 36:17.937
Just one more?

36:18.004 --> 36:19.437
Just one...

36:19.504 --> 36:20.837
Just one more.

36:20.903 --> 36:22.604
And then yourself.

36:22.671 --> 36:24.604
Just like he promised.

36:24.671 --> 36:26.271
Just one...ok.

36:26.337 --> 36:28.337
Just one.

36:28.404 --> 36:30.604
Last one.
last one.

36:30.671 --> 36:32.903
Take it.
go on, take it.

36:34.437 --> 36:35.604
Beautiful.

36:37.671 --> 36:38.937
Where did she--

36:39.004 --> 36:41.070
Ohh!

36:41.137 --> 36:42.537
Don't move.

36:43.903 --> 36:46.371
Hey!

36:46.437 --> 36:48.704
[giggling]

36:48.770 --> 36:50.037
Jj?

36:50.104 --> 36:51.037
Jj!

36:51.104 --> 36:52.571
In the back!

36:53.903 --> 36:56.638
Mine. this is mine.
it's mine. you can't--

36:56.704 --> 36:58.770
You can't have it. go away.

36:58.837 --> 37:00.770
Go away.

37:06.803 --> 37:08.271
Jj.

37:09.571 --> 37:10.571
Rossi: show me your hands!

37:10.638 --> 37:11.738
Let me see your hands!

37:11.803 --> 37:13.671
It's ok. it's ok.
get your hands clear!

37:13.738 --> 37:15.770
No, no, please, you have to--

37:15.837 --> 37:17.571
No, no, no, no! no, no, no!

37:17.638 --> 37:19.037
The blood is going bad!

37:19.104 --> 37:20.471
Please!
please don't do this!

37:20.537 --> 37:22.404
Are you armed?
no, no, no.

37:22.471 --> 37:23.404
No.

37:23.471 --> 37:24.404
Go, go!

37:24.471 --> 37:25.404
[gina screaming]

37:25.471 --> 37:26.504
Hey, i got nothing
to do with this.

37:26.571 --> 37:27.803
Hey, it's not me.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.070
It's the chick.

37:30.137 --> 37:33.004
It's got nothing to do
with me.

37:35.070 --> 37:37.170
Has something happened?

37:37.237 --> 37:40.337
It was your manager.

37:40.404 --> 37:43.437
He used a fan of yours.

37:43.504 --> 37:44.704
What?

37:44.770 --> 37:46.870
A young girl.
she'd been writing you letters

37:46.937 --> 37:49.371
About wanting to kill someone
for their blood.

37:49.437 --> 37:51.870
I never--i never
received anything.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.704
No, he did.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.937
And i guess he thought
he could use it for publicity.

37:56.004 --> 37:57.070
He was right.

37:57.137 --> 38:00.837
Your new album
is selling very well.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.371
I never asked for that.

38:03.437 --> 38:05.638
Well...

38:06.803 --> 38:08.204
Where is he?

38:08.271 --> 38:11.271
Your manager?
he's in custody.

38:11.337 --> 38:12.903
Is he ok? is there
anything i can do for him?

38:12.970 --> 38:15.638
He's gonna need
a good lawyer.

38:15.704 --> 38:16.770
What about the girl?

38:16.837 --> 38:18.337
I don't know
where she'll end up.

38:18.404 --> 38:19.671
She's pretty sick.

38:19.738 --> 38:23.638
I'd like to help her,
too, if i can.

38:25.271 --> 38:27.803
That's all?
i can go now?

38:28.571 --> 38:30.837
That's all.

38:35.070 --> 38:38.671
You know, all i really
ever wanted to do

38:38.738 --> 38:41.070
Was make music.

38:41.137 --> 38:44.571
And i'm not sure when
that stopped being enough.

38:58.937 --> 39:02.070
Hey, do you guys think
davies will continues
to perform as dante?

39:02.137 --> 39:05.371
The character's probably
responsible for
the murder of 4 women.

39:05.437 --> 39:07.371
If he has
any conscience at all,

39:07.437 --> 39:09.437
Dante died with them.

39:09.504 --> 39:11.638
Thanks.
are you ok?

39:11.704 --> 39:14.337
Yeah. doctor said
it'll be sore for a while,

39:14.404 --> 39:16.304
But i'm fine, really.

39:16.371 --> 39:18.304
I feel so bad
i didn't go with you

39:18.371 --> 39:19.371
To interview gina.

39:19.437 --> 39:20.738
Spence, stop,
all right?

39:20.803 --> 39:23.404
We had no way of knowing
she was gonna be dangerous.

39:23.471 --> 39:26.404
She was just the friend
of a victim.

39:26.471 --> 39:30.137
Granted, a schizophrenic friend
with a sociopathic partner.

39:30.204 --> 39:32.204
And a shovel.

39:32.271 --> 39:33.903
Seriously, reid,
we had no way of
knowing

39:33.970 --> 39:35.571
That gina had
that type of anger
inside of her.

39:35.638 --> 39:37.404
Yeah, but she was
obsessed with dante.

39:37.471 --> 39:38.870
I should have known
that that level of fixation

39:38.937 --> 39:40.471
Can lead to manipulation.

39:40.537 --> 39:41.970
But only when
the fixation's

39:42.037 --> 39:43.004
Coupled with
schizophrenia,

39:43.070 --> 39:44.337
Which we had no way
of knowing.

39:44.404 --> 39:46.770
Still it never ceases
to amaze me

39:46.837 --> 39:48.937
How dark obsession
can get.

39:49.004 --> 39:50.571
And with a pop star?

39:50.638 --> 39:52.204
I mean, i was
obsessed with
the rat pack,

39:52.271 --> 39:54.903
But i wouldn't have
killed for frank
or dean.

39:54.970 --> 39:57.304
No, you just drank
whiskey and smoked
cigars.

39:57.371 --> 39:59.471
This from
the man who's
favorite record

39:59.537 --> 40:01.237
Is the beatles'
white album.

40:01.304 --> 40:03.371
Just because manson
hijacked it

40:03.437 --> 40:04.638
Doesn't have to ruin it
for the rest of us.

40:04.704 --> 40:07.537
That's why i stick
to beethoven.

40:07.604 --> 40:10.837
There's no chance
of guilt by
association.

40:12.304 --> 40:14.870
Well, yeah.

40:14.937 --> 40:17.237
Have you ever seen
a movie called
"a clockwork orange"?

40:18.537 --> 40:19.903
Mm-mmm.

40:19.970 --> 40:23.770
[laughter]

40:23.837 --> 40:25.571

40:25.638 --> 40:28.304
"better to write for yourself
and have no public

40:28.371 --> 40:31.437
Than to write for the public
and have no self."
