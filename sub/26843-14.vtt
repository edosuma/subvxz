what we've been
working on this year

34:38.710 --> 34:41.344
and maybe kinda
strugglin' with.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.312
- Okay, well,
I'll go next.

34:42.347 --> 34:43.280
- Okay.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.949
- My low, if you really
wanna call it a low,

34:45.984 --> 34:49.653
would be my best friend,
Noelle, leaving me

34:49.688 --> 34:51.455
and going to college,

34:51.490 --> 34:53.123
even though I'm super
proud of her.

34:53.158 --> 34:54.658
Riley's gonna be doing
the same thing soon.

34:54.693 --> 34:55.859
- I know.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.828
- And she was your first,
and Noelle is my one and only,

34:57.863 --> 35:01.631
so it's just even--
it's a little deeper for me.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.700
My high, I think most of
you guys probably know.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.001
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.

35:05.037 --> 35:06.837
- Chill.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.506
- Well, you know,
when I, you know,
went through my divorce,

35:09.541 --> 35:11.007
I would always say I
would never, ever,

35:11.043 --> 35:14.177
ever, ever
get married again,

35:14.213 --> 35:16.379
and then I met Mike.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.115
You know,
I'm 51 years old.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.517
Um, you know, I think
it's great to take your time,

35:20.552 --> 35:23.153
but I also think that it's
great to just for it

35:23.188 --> 35:24.654
and live your life,
you know? Like--

35:24.690 --> 35:27.023
- Totally agree.
- Hmm.

35:27.059 --> 35:28.758
- Oh, it's my turn?
- Yeah.

35:28.794 --> 35:32.496
- I think my lows are that
I have not figured out

35:32.531 --> 35:35.966
how to balance
being career driven

35:36.001 --> 35:39.703
and still being supermom
at the same times.

35:39.738 --> 35:40.737
- Yeah, that's hard.

35:40.772 --> 35:41.605
- I don't know if I shared
this with everybody,

35:41.640 --> 35:43.773
but Todd and I
have been considering

35:43.809 --> 35:46.443
doin' a surrogate.
Riley is like,

35:46.478 --> 35:47.377
"Y'all don't need
to have any more kids

35:47.412 --> 35:48.712
"'cause y'all are too busy
as it is now."

35:48.747 --> 35:50.680
- She's so Kandi.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.215
- Yeah, that's
Kandi Junior.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.383
- KJ.

35:53.418 --> 35:56.653
- My highs are my business
is great all the way around.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.021
- It's gonna take a long time
with all your highs.

35:58.056 --> 35:58.955
- Yes.

35:58.991 --> 35:59.623
- I was like, there's one
or two of those.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.224
- My burlesque show thing--

36:01.260 --> 36:02.959
the restaurant
is doin' amazing.

36:02.995 --> 36:03.927
Opening the second location,

36:03.962 --> 36:06.029
but we also have
a third location comin' up.

36:06.064 --> 36:07.063
- Well, I think we're
just about out of time

36:07.099 --> 36:08.899

36:08.934 --> 36:12.235

Thank you.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.075
- I can't eat
none of that.

36:19.111 --> 36:21.578
Um, I don't eat
any raw fish.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.613
So, do you have
some substitutes?

36:23.649 --> 36:24.981
- Of course.
- Okay.

36:38.797 --> 36:39.863

I'm just really excited

36:41.967 --> 36:44.267

36:44.303 --> 36:46.937
Right before
I got with Dennis,

36:46.972 --> 36:48.238
I actually decided, okay,

36:48.273 --> 36:50.774
it's not for me
to have the baby

36:50.809 --> 36:52.909
and the lifestyle
that I always had, like,

36:52.945 --> 36:54.744
said that I was
gonna have.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.781
I'm just thankful
to have Dennis

36:57.816 --> 37:00.150
because he brought hope
back into my life.

37:00.185 --> 37:02.152
I mean, he's brought
new life into my life,

37:02.187 --> 37:03.787
literally.

37:03.822 --> 37:06.256
He and I are partners.
He is a completer.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.758
He will come in and be like,
"What is it you wanna do?"

37:08.794 --> 37:09.626
And he make it happen
like a true partner,

37:09.661 --> 37:11.161

Todd is with you.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.963

mm-hmm.

37:12.998 --> 37:13.997

I have more of a purpose,

37:16.168 --> 37:17.834

39:44.783 --> 39:46.416
I had lost
my passion to sing

39:46.451 --> 39:49.853

in a positive direction.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.421
