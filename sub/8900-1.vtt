WEBVTT

00:57.719 --> 00:59.719
Oi! Man in the water!

00:59.720 --> 01:02.121
Man in the fucking water.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.890
Shit. Stick to their own fucking side, man.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.603
Cheeky fucking midgets.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.722
Oi. Check your arcs, Rambo.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.324
VVhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mowgli!

01:26.360 --> 01:29.728
I'm here trying to bring fucking peace and
love to your shitty stone-age country.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.969
Is it too much to be able to enjoy a rinse without
taking indirect fucking fire from you lot?

01:46.120 --> 01:48.168
Let that be a lesson to ya.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.883
Go on, fuck off now, then.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.809
Ever heard the one about not walking into a room

01:55.840 --> 01:57.922
until you know how you're
walking out of there, Tug?

02:03.400 --> 02:06.688
We all miss our birds, rnucker. No need
to start groorning the local nippers.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.324
Fuck off.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.521
Grenade fishing, nearly catch
of the fucking day, me.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.809
Hey, no harm done.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.926
TWO, yeah?

02:33.720 --> 02:38.089
First lesson my grandma taught me, Tug.
Don't pick a fight with an armed midget.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.730
We're a long way from home.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.728
What you talking about, you're from Huddersfield.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.803
- Go on, mate.
- Cheers.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.084
Race you back up?

02:49.720 --> 02:51.688
Ah, you're fully loaded, mate. Unfair fight.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.363
OK, go! Now!

04:04.880 --> 04:06.803
- Signals?
- Yeah, mate. Cheers.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.884
Come on then, what's the news? Heard
there was a heatwave back home.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.528
- Typical, innit?
- Heatwave? Pissed it down, mate.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.086
Anyway, where's the FLET?

04:21.640 --> 04:23.768
FLET? Hat!

04:23.800 --> 04:26.007
It's all around you, mate.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.681
Terry pokes his nose up here. We
smash him back into his hole.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.242
Bosh!

04:35.400 --> 04:37.926
- Did you bring it?
- In the back, pal.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.088
My guy tells me something's coming.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.727
They got a new field commander.
Keep your eyes open.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.603
Sure, John. Cheers.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.404
- Civvies here?
- Yank security.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.521
They look after the engineers working on the dam.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.688
Talk about hearts and minds,

04:54.720 --> 04:57.041
this joint would supply electricity
to half of bloody Helmand

04:57.080 --> 04:59.731
if someone could work out how to turn it on.

04:59.840 --> 05:03.890
- So where have you been?
- Ops room, Bastion. Sangin, then here.

05:03.920 --> 05:07.641
- Ah, Sangin. Proper tasty, right?
- Telling me.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.560
- Is this us?
- Nah. OMLTs.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.331
Teaching the ANA which end
of a weapon's the noisy bit.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.324
We're up top, mate.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.562
- So what's it like up here?
- Right, OK, fellas...

05:21.640 --> 05:24.120
It's going on, that's what it is, rnucker.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.642
I quit the reg after Telic. Zero contacts, mate.

05:27.880 --> 05:31.089
I joined back when Herrick was on.
Finally get a piece of the action.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.249
Rather be in the scrum than on a
subs bench, do you know what I mean?

05:34.280 --> 05:35.850
Not really.

05:35.880 --> 05:40.044
Rugby's a real game, mate. Taliban
should play it. Tough bastards.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.887
I'm pretty sure Afghans don't play rugby.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.046
Here, look, look, look.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.611
- Give us a lift up, pal?
- Hop on, Tug.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.886
- Do one, Prosser!
- Good for you, hat.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.968
Fucking dick swinger.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.410
Hop on, Mark!

06:24.040 --> 06:26.930
- Did they come?
- Dunno, look in here, Spud.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.848
Sergeant McMellon. Signaller Jones.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.968
Shit the fucking bed!

06:35.160 --> 06:38.562
I hope you know how to use a radio
without batteries, Signaller Jones.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.170
For fuck's sake.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.851
- Right, welfare box. Who wants it?
- Yeah, I'll have it, Pross.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.644
Any decent scoff though, we split it, yeah?

06:44.680 --> 06:48.401
Prosser, stop twatting about
and get that stuff up there!

06:53.800 --> 06:57.009
Fusilier AL Barlow's got his porn re-sup.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.008
Fuck me, Ken, your mum looks hotter every month.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.328
- Yeah, fucking hands off, mate.
- The rest?

07:04.040 --> 07:06.168
Mark. Here you go, mate.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.531
Cheers, pal.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.365
- Signals?
- Oman, yeah.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.209
- Jonesy.
- Mark.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.288
- How you doing, man?
- Good, mate.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.401
- What the fuck's this?
- You been up here before?

07:19.440 --> 07:21.204
- You dicks!
- No, first time.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.922
- Aye, ar, mortar boys, you can have that one.
- Jay, you wanna show him around, mate.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.601
Well, we know where your basha is, Barlow.
Keep an eye open, that's all I'm saying, mate.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.965
Look.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.403
Luke, boat came in, mate.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.805
Skin 'em up will you.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.846
- Prosser, catch you up there, pal.
- Yeah, man.

07:49.440 --> 07:54.287
Fuck it. Ten quid. Thanks Aunt Pam,
just what I fucking need out here.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.931
New TACSAT's come in, Spud. I'll set it up.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.407
This is Athens. You've got
three-sixty all-round defense.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.603
Down here you've got the GPMG fifty cal.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.611
Clackers for the claymores. In
here's the interpreter's place.

08:13.720 --> 08:17.770
That's water, ablutions. You got
burn pit, shit pit down beyond that.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.287
Right, this needs to go over with the other stuff.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.407
Ken.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.961
Oh, for fuck's sake, Spud, I did it yesterday.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.067
Thank you, Ken.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.806
Thank you, Prosser.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.724
- Come on, lads...
- You're in here with the medic and the med store.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.761
- HQ, mortar pit.
- <i>Go on then, fucking sign 'em out...</i>

08:33.799 --> 08:35.847
There's about sixteen odd here at Athens.

08:35.880 --> 08:40.203
Seven, eight, up at Normandy. That's it.
Stay on marked tracks. Enjoy.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.771
Well, the clinical term is dick rot.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.802
- Was it anyone nice?
- Four, actually. All delightful.

08:59.880 --> 09:00.908
Bastard.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.208
Right, put it away. You gotta be
careful flashing it about this lot.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.764
What is it? Long time on the hill.

09:08.200 --> 09:13.809
Gungy mortars? The rumors are true, pal.
Not that they'd go near that rancid thing.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.326
Oh, yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.128
From Nog Gorman.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.090
Happy birthday.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.161
He says make sure you save 'em
till the big day. When's that?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.771
Seventh. Why, what are we now?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.689
Unlucky, pal. Fifth.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.611
Fuck that. I'm not waiting two fucking days.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.685
Oh. You taking heat up here?

09:38.280 --> 09:40.647
Nah, I get more contacts when my bird's on the rag.

09:43.080 --> 09:47.165
I mean it were busy for a bit but...
Terry's pissed off back to Sangin.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.003
We own all this high ground.
Out of small arms range.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.163
A few Chinese rockets, bit of boom
boom in the valley, but that's it.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.809
Lucky 'cause we're out of ammo.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.090
Nah, boredom or ANA'll get you before Terry does.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.250
- Right. Jonesy, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.729
Antibiotics, anti-inflammatories.
Take one of each before each meal.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.040
Run the course.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.882
Give the pin dick a bit of R and R, yeah?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.802
Stop staring at me arse, you throbber.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.162
What's the fucking hurry, hat?

10:53.080 --> 10:55.162
Aye up, lads, budgie express inbound.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.051
Uh, wind direction please, Private Harvey.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.441
- I do know this guy, right?
- Out of the west, Private Smith.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.562
Uh, yeah.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.964
OK, I'm, uh...

11:05.560 --> 11:10.043
I'm dead. I'm a man. I'm British.
I've got a gay beard.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.387
We think.

11:11.800 --> 11:17.011
We think. I, uh... killed a
king and I'm not Guy Fawkes.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.289
Who didn't kill anyone.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.123
- For fuck's sake, Stu, mate.
- Fucker!

11:24.240 --> 11:26.129
It's like watching a retard
trying to fuck a doorknob.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.929
I thought you knew your fucking history.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.410
Just fucking guess, will you,
before I slit my fucking wrists.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.681
- Am I anything to do with King Arthur?
- No.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.371
You got three guesses and then
it's five bines for mush.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.166
- This is a fucking stitch-up.
- Ah, hey, rules is rules. Right, Stu?

11:41.360 --> 11:44.204
When you're Wounded and left
on Afghanistan's plains

11:44.600 --> 11:46.682
and the women come out to out up what remains

11:46.800 --> 11:49.451
just roll to your rifle and
blow out your brains...?

11:49.600 --> 11:51.682
And go to your God like a soldier.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.643
For fuck's sake.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.687
What you doing putting this
shit in your fucking head?

11:57.120 --> 11:59.043
Well, it's a bit of perspective, innit?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.446
Perspective on what?

12:01.200 --> 12:04.010
What a dour-faced bastard Rudyard Kipling was?

12:04.760 --> 12:06.205
You fucking pricks.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.764
It's Quasimodo and Wurzel Gummidge.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.210
- It's alright...
- What happened, Ken?

12:12.240 --> 12:14.720
...you can get your own fucking shit tomorrow, OK?

12:18.080 --> 12:20.003
Did you get the three-fifty chargers?

12:20.320 --> 12:21.765
Uh, negative.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.203
For fuck's sake.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.806
- Fuck off the two of youse.
- Prosser's got another unit.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.686
- Alright cock smokers?
- Yeah.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.726
Here, how come it's always you
that gets the crap jobs then, Ken?

12:32.760 --> 12:33.802
Ah, fuck off.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.444
Crap hat, crap job.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.807
Eh, you can fuck off too, Cromwell.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.887
Faz.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.845
- Am I Oliver Cromwell?
- You're an idiot.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.641
It doesn't count if someone
fucking tells you, does it?

12:44.720 --> 12:48.122
- Rules is rules, Smudge, yeah. Five bines.
- You absolute knob.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.161
Nice shot...

12:52.280 --> 12:55.966
I swear to fuck, Smudge, see if you make
me Jimmy fucking Krankie one more time

13:15.440 --> 13:18.171
Here, Smudge, watch this. Ready?

13:25.440 --> 13:26.462
'Pressive.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.406
Ninja fingers, mate.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.331
- ...weird.
- Mayo on sausage? You fucking weirdo, mate.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.761
It's sweet, mate. Mate, sausage,
cheese and mayo on a fucking sandwich.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.565
Swear to God, mate. Don't look at
me like that, I'm telling you.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.286
Hurry up, man. I'm fucking starving.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.011
There's a lot of fucking about down there, Mush.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.527
Oh. Fucking petrol station again, mate.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.088
- Here, go get Stu.
- Sure.

14:54.840 --> 15:01.724
Stu. Stu. Stu. Stu! Wake up, mate.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.931
Activity at the petrol station.
Come on, get your arse up.

15:06.440 --> 15:10.047
- Come on.
- Fucking hell. Alright, come on.

15:11.960 --> 15:15.407
Bloody hell, Jar Head. I was
just getting to the good bit.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.250
Right, what we looking at?

15:21.560 --> 15:23.608
It's that fucking petrol station again, Mush.

15:30.560 --> 15:34.326
They're persistent little
bastards, I'll give 'em that.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.525
Right.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.166
Kilo Two, this is Kilo Five, over.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.040
Kilo Two, this is Kilo Five. Over.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.166
For fuck's sake.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.411

the fuck was that? Over.

16:10.840 --> 16:15.721

17:42.440 --> 17:43.441
Ammo ready.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.227

17:45.240 --> 17:46.446

18:15.040 --> 18:20.285
<i>Hitman One One, clear hot. Hitman
One One all hot, nine seconds.</i>

18:20.320 --> 18:21.924
He needs double tops...

18:28.440 --> 18:31.887
- Still needs double tops.
- What's he fucking doing over there?

18:32.160 --> 18:35.130
Hitman One One, missed target.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.642
- That cunt couldn't finish off his dinner.
- Target is two-hundred metres west...

18:37.680 --> 18:41.526
- Well it shut 'em up at least.
- ...of impact point. Request another run.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.126
<i>Hitman One One...</i>

18:44.520 --> 18:49.526
negative Widow One Three, I

19:13.960 --> 19:17.009
We can pick them up forty-six Kâ€™s away
but not Normandy one K away, mate.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.685
Fucking scalies, right?

19:19.800 --> 19:20.842
Yeah.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.321
- You just come from there?
- Yeah. R and R, but before then, though, yeah.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.165
Were you there when Bry Budd got killed?

19:28.880 --> 19:31.884
Team medic. I saw him when he came in.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.442
Brave fucker should get something for it.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.087
Yeah, too right, mate. Too right.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.644
We spent five weeks up there
with our arses hanging out.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.850
- I was there the night they hit the tower.
- I heard about that.

19:46.120 --> 19:50.045
There was Pete Thorpe, Hashmi and a terp
listening to all the ICOMM chatter.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.286
Told us to get down, knew something was
coming, then it fucking took them all out.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.727
Aye.

20:01.440 --> 20:07.607
- Anyway. You on selection, that you?
- Yeah, maybe.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.248
I fucked my knee on the hill two years ago.

20:10.640 --> 20:14.087
One shot left. Gill's not
exactly crazy about it, like.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.366
What, your missus?

20:15.560 --> 20:17.210
- Fiancee.
- Still do it, though, yeah?

20:17.920 --> 20:21.720
My uncle's an SSM in Hereford, mate. Wouldn't
let me hear the end of it if I didn't.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.250
- How about you?
- I don't know...

20:25.280 --> 20:26.611
...maybe in a few years.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.726
Yeah, good.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.762
Shh, Shh, shh, Shh.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.245
Dog biscuits?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.003
Best mate's wife sends 'em out.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.806
- Yeah.
- There a lot of mines out there?

20:55.560 --> 20:59.531
Mate, this whole country's full of shit
left behind when armies fucked off.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.763
Roads, tanks, mujaheddin.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.169
Russians it was the mines.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.127
Ten million fucking mines.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.051
Come on.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.962
God knows what we're going to leave behind.

21:18.680 --> 21:19.920
Come on.

21:26.240 --> 21:31.007
Aye up. Looks like Kajaki Jon was
right for once. Definitely stopped that motor.

21:32.800 --> 21:38.603
Yeah, they're pulling them out the back. It's
two adults, looks like, uh, two children.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.163
Cash changing hands.

21:44.920 --> 21:49.369
Well, that's an illegal vehicle checkpoint
on the six one one, Corporal Pearson.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.164
Militia threatening and
extorting money from civilians.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.498
Well, that explains that
fucking about last night.

21:55.517 --> 21:56.609
Hmm.

21:56.660 --> 21:57.786
Range?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.684
Two-five, two-eight?

22:01.040 --> 22:03.202
- To far for a snipe.
- Not from here, yeah.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.803
- What about a mortar?
- Nah, civvies.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.005
There's a possible firing position, ridge
to the south. Brings 'em in range.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.282
Dunno, there's a lot of deep ground out there.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.683
Cannae see any ground sign.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.644
Could take the goat track down.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.202
Smudge's been laying trip
flares down there, right?

22:35.360 --> 22:41.322
Well... at least it ain't just
another day on Mount fucking Longer.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.251
Fuck it

22:51.440 --> 22:54.205
- We need to OK this with Spud, alright?
- Hmm.

22:55.640 --> 22:59.440
Right, go and give the ladies
a shout, get a plan together.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.601

32:48.680 --> 32:49.747
Aye.

32:49.880 --> 32:52.850
All I heard was 'Oh, my leg! My fucking leg.'

32:53.240 --> 32:56.244
I thought to myself, here I
know that big poofy voice.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.090
You reckon I'll still be alright
for selection, rnucker?

33:03.600 --> 33:06.285
Course you will, buddy, alright.
You're gonna be fine.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.210
I was fucking joking, mate.

33:14.360 --> 33:18.251
Just sit tight, alright? We're
gonna get you out of here.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.643
Hey. You alright, yeah?

33:26.840 --> 33:28.285
Maybe we can carry him up?

33:29.520 --> 33:31.841
I don't know, mate. We need to keep him level.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.650

33:52.040 --> 33:54.042
Fucking piece of fucking shit.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.347
What's happening?

33:55.720 --> 33:58.166
Stu Hale went on a patrol.
Think he trod on a mine.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.268
Where?

33:59.360 --> 34:02.284
Down the wadi. Stu Pearson
took Smudge to check him out.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.845
There's no comms on the ground.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.467
What's that?

34:12.520 --> 34:16.730
'I. Am. Gay.' Jar Head, mate, now's not the time.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.360
Oi, Smudger.

34:22.239 --> 34:27.406
- You couldn't check my prick for me, mucker?
- Yeah, it's alright. It's still there, still tiny.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.409
Give us a fag, would you.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.763
Watch your step, mate. There's mines.

34:40.239 --> 34:41.525
I've got a med kit.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.562
Oi, follow our line in, mush.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.922

34:54.159 --> 34:55.764

34:56.760 --> 34:58.091
Fuck me!

34:58.800 --> 35:01.565
- How you doing?
- Yeah, no fucking drama, mate.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.290
It's still bleeding. I got another tourniquet.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.924

35:08.960 --> 35:10.724

35:34.080 --> 35:39.325
Nearest secure HLS is Lancaster. No
emergency HLS identified at this time.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.929
Winch requested. Over.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.891
<i>Can casualty be extracted to HLS? Over.</i>

- Uh... two more.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.682
You stay here. Give me the comms.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.201
I'll take one up to Normandy, put the

Right, I'm Kilo Five Alpha. Kilo Five Bravo,
in the wadi. Normandy stays Kilo Two.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.448
- Alright, let's go, come on.
- Yeah.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.564
You're doing brilliant, buddy. You're doing
absolutely fucking brilliant, alright?

36:12.520 --> 36:13.726
Keep the leg still, yeah?

36:14.440 --> 36:16.010
Any of youse know how to cannulate?

36:25.080 --> 36:27.560
- Glad you could join us, Tug.
- I'm faster downhill.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.086
Fucking...

36:31.840 --> 36:33.524
Follow the line in, Mark.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.091
<i>...dressing to the knee.</i>

36:38.280 --> 36:40.442
Tug. Tug, I'm out of dressings, mate.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.643
- Grab a stretcher, buddy.
- There's still dripping on the stump here, mate.

36:43.680 --> 36:44.722
OK, everybody.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.524
- Nothing left, mate, at all.
- Shut the fuck up, now!

36:46.760 --> 36:48.205
Jar Head, get them buttons done.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.321
Tell me what's going on, pal.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.370
Alright, um, right leg as you see it, mate

36:53.400 --> 36:55.767
- Uh... right hand.
- Yeah.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.165
- Damage to left leg.
- Yeah.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.441
Uh, says his right knee's giving him jip, too.

36:59.600 --> 37:03.446
I've strapped it off, given him a
pen of morphine, marked it up.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.887
- I'm fucking shit out of med kit now, mate.
- Right, Jay?

37:05.920 --> 37:07.729
- SITREP, mate.
- I applied a second tourniquet.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.367
- Um, I've wrapped it up...
- We've got deep ground all round, buddy.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.920
I've got the OP keeping an eye on us, but
we don't want to get taken by surprise.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.291
Alright. Nicely done, lads.

37:18.880 --> 37:23.329
- Further mine threat?
- Fuck knows. We need to assume there is.

37:24.680 --> 37:26.728
- Extraction?
- I've asked for a winch.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.520
Good job.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.851
Right lads, listen in.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.690
We've a bloke on his arse so
let's make him comfortable.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.927
Smudge, get some cover on him, mate.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.548
Luke, join Foreman on stag.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.642
Kenny, you rnucker,

37:39.680 --> 37:42.570
mark the safe route in, clear the area around Stu.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.091
Check your immediate space, fellas.
Stand only on proven safe route.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.242
- Jonesy, get on Athens, check on CAS EVAC.
- Right, Stuart...

37:50.280 --> 37:52.044
Stick your ball... ball
your hand on my fist, yeah?

37:52.400 --> 37:53.442
Dave.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.246
Nobody else in or out without
my say so, buddy, alright?

37:59.520 --> 38:00.567
What's our call sign?

38:00.600 --> 38:01.886
Kilo Two Bravo, mate.

38:01.920 --> 38:04.048
- But you won't get any response from that one.
- Just fucking try it!

38:04.120 --> 38:06.600
Hello Kilo Five, this is Kilo Two. Bravo, over.

38:10.120 --> 38:13.329
Hello Kilo Five, this is Kilo Two Bravo.
Radio check, over.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.806
Always get the crap jobs, eh, Ken.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.324
Down the wadi. Follow the goat track.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.321
We got comms.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.369
Hey, radio check when you're in.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.092
Alright lads, this isn't working,
we need to get that Bergen

38:37.111 --> 38:38.740
underneath his knee, keep it elevated, yeah.

38:38.760 --> 38:39.966
- Smudge?
- Ah, cool.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.049
Let's get this med pack
underneath his head, Jar Head.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.963
- Yeah, just watch his spine, pal.
- Cheers.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.650
Tanning tips for redheads, eh?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.161
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa wait.

38:52.600 --> 38:53.647
I think I found something.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.440
No, it's just a rock.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.243
Jesus, Ken.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.611
- Hey, hey...
- I'm sorry lads, I'm sorry.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.688
Come on, listen. It's important that
we clear the rocks out as well.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.326
You know, in case we want to come down
and plant some fucking cabbages one day.

39:19.080 --> 39:22.846
Right, Stu. Looks like you might
have a break above the knee.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.800
Nothing I can do now, but I've given
you another stick of morphine, yeah?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.924
I know it chafes but you're not dying today, yeah.

39:30.360 --> 39:32.442
You're a strong fucker, you're gonna be alright.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.603
Onto the fucking paperwork.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.967
- Oi, Tug.
- Yes, mate.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.124
Give us a fag, would you mate?

39:45.560 --> 39:47.085
Mate, just one fucking bine.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.282
What's it gonna do? Blow my other fucking leg off?

39:51.200 --> 39:52.287
Huh?

40:00.080 --> 40:01.650
You fucking legend, mate.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.647
I won't tell on you if you don't tell on me.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.086
Stable down here, Mark. How we doing on CAS EVAC?

40:17.640 --> 40:18.926
Nobody else in, mate.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.925
I've got comms from Normandy.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.527
The medic can come in, Dave, no one else.

40:24.880 --> 40:25.888
Be my guest.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.406
Marked route, pal.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.930
You're Kilo Five Bravo

40:39.440 --> 40:42.569
Spud's Kilo Five Alpha and Normandy's Kilo Two.

40:42.760 --> 40:43.768
Cheers, pal.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.604
Alex, how are you for fluids, pal?

40:45.920 --> 40:48.526
Hello Kilo Five Alpha, this
is Kilo Five Bravo, Over.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.804
<i>Kilo Five Alpha, what's the
status on casualty? Over.</i>

40:51.880 --> 40:53.291
Corporal Hale is P one.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.922
Stable but needs immediate EVAC, Spud.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.851
<i>Can casualty be moved to Normandy for EVAC? Over.</i>

40:58.880 --> 41:03.169
- Wait out. Medics, can we carry him out?
- Well, he's stable when he's flat.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.609
At an angle there's a chance he
could bleed out or bleed in.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.404
- We need a winch, pal.
- That's what I've been saying.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.441
We've got a stretcher.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.365
We should have enough bodies to keep him level.

41:10.600 --> 41:13.604
- Have you seen how fucking steep it is?
- Just cut the corner, go up the re-entrant.

41:13.880 --> 41:14.927
No way are we leaving the path.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.406
I'm saying stick tight, wait here for the heli.
That's my opinion.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.689
Mark, what you thinking?

41:22.360 --> 41:24.601
We need to pull him away from the rocks.
Get him in the open.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.807
There, the raised bank.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.447
Alright.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.326
Right, lads, listen up.

41:40.720 --> 41:43.803
- I need 2 bodies to help clear a route over there.
- <i>Kilo Five Alpha, send, over.</i>

41:44.120 --> 41:45.565
Kilo Five Bravo, preparing to move.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.840
Tidy, step in.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.561
I want youse on your belt
buckles, shoulder to shoulder.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.570
I'm gonna follow youse with the flags.

41:51.600 --> 41:52.681
<i>Roger. Wait out.</i>

41:54.080 --> 41:55.684
Come on, lads, let's fucking move.

42:04.680 --> 42:05.747
You're seeing this?

42:14.840 --> 42:19.084
Kilo Two to Kilo Five Alpha. Taliban
movement on the six one one.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.811
<i>Might be headed your way.</i>

42:20.880 --> 42:22.928
<i>Roger Kilo Two, keep your eyes on it.</i>

42:22.960 --> 42:28.410
<i>Kilo Five Alpha to all call signs. Be advised,
enemy movement in the vicinity of Tangi.</i>

42:28.640 --> 42:31.723
<i>Possible threat to Kilo Five
Bravo position. Wait out.</i>

42:55.360 --> 42:57.806
I might as well be prodding a fucking car park.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.689
At least if it's this hard they won't
detonate if you walk over 'em.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.643
I don't think that's how it work.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.565
One here, boss.

43:18.320 --> 43:21.449
Just mark it buddy... and then deviate.

43:28.320 --> 43:31.608
- So I killed lots of people but I'm not a soldier?
- Correct.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.682
- Killed myself?
- Yeah, um... hanged yourself, I think.

43:37.880 --> 43:40.451
What am I some kind of fucking
serial killer or something?

43:41.880 --> 43:44.611
- Correct.
- Fucking prick.

43:49.720 --> 43:53.008
Oi, same again barman, yeah?

43:56.440 --> 43:57.771
How many's he had now?

44:00.320 --> 44:01.328
That's his third.

44:04.141 --> 44:05.841
Am I...

44:08.560 --> 44:10.210
- Stu?
- Yeah?

44:10.240 --> 44:11.605
You got a bleed on on the left leg, mate.

44:11.640 --> 44:12.801
Nothing major.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.244
Just gonna tie you off, pal, alright?

44:16.000 --> 44:17.081
Better safe...

44:21.040 --> 44:25.921
- Am I... uh... am I Fred West?
- No.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.728
- This is the last from Normandy.
- Nice one, Prosser.

44:45.720 --> 44:46.881
Cheers, Jonesy.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.725

46:56.520 --> 46:58.807
- You alright up there, Stu?
- Hmm-mm.

46:59.160 --> 47:02.050
Ah, like the Maharajah of
Helmand Province, aren't you.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.245
You want to peel me a grape?

47:05.200 --> 47:07.328
Nah, but I've got a couple of
ripe plums here, if you want.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.962

47:38.320 --> 47:40.527
I need overwatch from all of you, got that?

47:41.720 --> 47:44.451
Stretcher bearers and Tug stay with Stu.

47:45.200 --> 47:48.443
All other personnel, thank you for your
help, boys, and you can all fuck off now.

47:48.760 --> 47:50.091

47:50.920 --> 47:51.928
Oi.

Stuey, smile for the camera, buddy.

47:54.900 --> 47:55.962

48:13.280 --> 48:14.566
- Will do, buddy.
- Hmm.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.291
With fucking pleasure.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.210
You faggots, stop flirting.

48:19.680 --> 48:24.322
If you're the Russians, you know, seventy-nine,
eighty and you're defending Normandy...

48:25.000 --> 48:26.365
Where'd you lay your APs?

48:26.440 --> 48:29.649

- Dead ground on approaches to the OP.

48:30.080 --> 48:32.003

- Dunno.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.849
What the fuck are mines doing down here, mate?

48:45.120 --> 48:46.929
Oh, for fuck's sake.

49:01.040 --> 49:03.281

place is fucking loaded.

49:03.680 --> 49:04.886
I stood on a fucking...

49:05.040 --> 49:06.963
Safe route is not fucking safe, man.

Ah, fuck! Ah, fuck!

49:10.240 --> 49:11.366
Let's go.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.881
Somebody get me some fucking morphine.

49:14.640 --> 49:17.723
- Oh, fuck. Ah, fuck. Fuck off.
- It's alright, Stu.

49:17.760 --> 49:20.331
- Let me do my job, buddy. Let me do my job.
- Leave me! Fucking leave me!

49:20.360 --> 49:22.681
- Stuey... Stu.
- Fuck! Fucking hell.

49:23.520 --> 49:27.366
- Was it fucking Stu?
- Come on. Come keep your shit together.

49:30.600 --> 49:32.011
- Alex, do you need any kit?
- Get off me.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.643
Ah, leave me. Just fucking leave me.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.406
- Right, all done.
- Nice and tight, mate.

49:36.440 --> 49:37.502
Yup.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.411
- Get ready to take his leg.
- No!

49:40.440 --> 49:42.727
Right.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.162
Fuck! Fuck!

49:48.880 --> 49:50.848
- OK, all done.
- Any kit out?

49:52.720 --> 49:54.006
Right, move it.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.727
- Fuck. Oh, fuck!
- OK, mate.

49:57.840 --> 50:00.161
- Ah, fucking hell! It really... Ah!
- Right, alright...

50:01.520 --> 50:03.284
- Fuck!
- What kit have you got?

50:03.720 --> 50:05.802
- Oh fuck!
- Mate, where's your fucking Bergen?

50:06.080 --> 50:07.127
He was carrying it.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.566
What have you got?

50:09.720 --> 50:12.883
Uh, morphine, tourniquet, saline, dressing.
One of each.

50:12.920 --> 50:13.942
Ken, elevate the leg!

50:14.840 --> 50:18.561
- What do you need, pal. Let me know.
- Stay there, Tug. Just fucking stay with Stu.

50:18.600 --> 50:22.924
- Mark. Now, Mark, do you need me in there?
- Stand firm, Jar Head. No one in.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.210
Help yourself here. Here take the fucking leg.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.004
<i>Kilo Two to Kilo Five Bravo. SITREP, over.</i>

50:29.040 --> 50:30.280
- Take his leg.
- Yeah.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.321
- His leg, mate.
- Move it, move.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.521
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:34.120 --> 50:39.206
Kilo Five Bravo. Mine strike,
Stu Pearson. P one, left leg.

50:39.400 --> 50:42.449
Notify CAS EVAC need for second winch. Over.

50:42.640 --> 50:46.645
<i>Kilo Two to Kilo Five Bravo. It's
a negative on the winch. Over.</i>

50:48.080 --> 50:52.051
Say again. I was informed
Black Hawk was inbound, over.

50:52.120 --> 50:56.603
<i>We'll get you out of there. Just
hang tight, Bravo. OK, wait out.</i>

50:56.840 --> 50:58.285
Going to fucking shit!

50:58.320 --> 50:59.890
- Come on.
- Fuck you!

51:00.240 --> 51:02.242
Can we not just take him over the ridge?

51:02.520 --> 51:05.947
Right, there's a... there's a route up to
Normandy already. It's already fucking marked.

51:05.980 --> 51:07.384
Just take 'em up there. Enough is e-fucking-nough

51:07.420 --> 51:08.881
- we're getting blown up here!
- Smudge, Smudge, Smudge.

51:08.920 --> 51:10.843
Did you not just see what
happened to your pal, Stu?

51:10.880 --> 51:12.689
- Yeah!
- The fucking whole place is charged, mate.

51:12.840 --> 51:15.241
We're going nowhere. Fucking sit down.

51:15.320 --> 51:18.767
Turn your fucking head around and don't
look anywhere except for up there.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.045
Just don't look at him, alright?

51:25.520 --> 51:27.443
See, you hear that? Angels with fucking wings.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.682
Fuck me. Ah, fuck!

51:35.760 --> 51:37.205
That's not a Black Hawk.

51:40.320 --> 51:42.004
Chopper inbound.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.207
Laid them in fucking threes, didn't they?

51:46.560 --> 51:47.568
What's that, pal?

51:48.840 --> 51:51.969
Fucking APs. Ah, fuck.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.963
Hit the guy treating the first victim.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.769
Maximum clusterfuck.

51:59.600 --> 52:00.642
That's a Chinook.

52:00.960 --> 52:02.610
They'll be dropping the MERT at Lancaster.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.770
How you doing, fella? You alright?

52:07.720 --> 52:11.122
Save my nuts, Doc. That's all I ask.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.171
Fuck.

52:15.400 --> 52:17.801
Hey. Your nuts are fine.

52:18.320 --> 52:21.927
- Fuck. Oh, Alex, it's still bleeding, mate.
- What? Yeah, alright, smart.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.647
- This is my last tourniquet.
- Oh, fuck!

52:31.680 --> 52:33.728
- Boys... this fucking minefield.
- Alright, mate. Alright.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.147
Fuck!

52:38.120 --> 52:39.167
Here's something to put on it.

52:40.720 --> 52:41.728
Alright.

52:42.640 --> 52:44.529
- Right, hold this fucking leg, too.
- Yeah, brother.

52:44.560 --> 52:46.164
- Fuck you!
- Alright, mate, we've got you.

52:52.400 --> 52:55.882
Kilo Five Bravo to all Kilos.
We have a Chinook inbound.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.241
Please confirm this is not our CAS EVAC, over?

52:58.760 --> 53:00.250
- Snoop, you got a med pack?
- <i>Kilo Four, affirmative.</i>

53:00.280 --> 53:02.647
- Nah.
- <i>Kilo Five Bravo. CAS EVAC inbound.</i>

53:02.680 --> 53:04.364
- Luke, med pack?
- Nah, I got nothing, mate.

53:04.400 --> 53:07.051
<i>Recommend move casualty to HLS nearby. Over.</i>

53:07.720 --> 53:11.964
Negative. Confirm, we have two, repeat,
two P ones requiring CAS EVAC.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.887
Movement impossible due to
location being minefield...

53:15.920 --> 53:19.686
Chinook unsuitable for pick-up
due to location being minefield.

53:20.120 --> 53:24.205
Request HH sixty with winch
as previously indicated.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.846
Location is a fucking minefield. Over.

53:30.720 --> 53:33.405
<i>Chinook only asset available at present. Over.</i>

53:34.520 --> 53:37.330
Can I have direct comms with Chinook?

53:37.680 --> 53:41.571
<i>Negative Kilo Five Bravo, comms
via JTAC to Apache to Chinook.</i>

53:43.280 --> 53:46.841
- Whoever this is, come in.
- <i>Go ahead, Bravo.</i>

53:47.120 --> 53:51.250
Suggest Chinook enter via
re-entrant to southwest.

53:52.760 --> 53:56.128
Back wheels down onto the rocks. We'll drop smoke.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.049
We may be able to load one
casualty this way. Over.

54:02.320 --> 54:05.051
- <i>Wait out.</i>
- You fucking wait out, pal.

54:06.040 --> 54:07.724
<i>Kilo Two to Kilo Five Bravo.</i>

54:07.800 --> 54:11.043
They're not gonna land in a minefield, buddy.
Just sit tight.

54:11.080 --> 54:14.323
Hey! Drop smoke.

54:16.240 --> 54:18.447
We need to show him where to touch down, yeah.

54:36.920 --> 54:44.122
...not land in the fucking wadi. This
is a hot HLS, repeat, mines, over.

54:48.600 --> 54:51.171
The fucking rocks. Land on the rocks.

54:57.560 --> 55:00.682
- What's he fucking saying?
- He wants to bring him over.

55:00.720 --> 55:01.807
Alright, let's do it then.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.446
No fucking way. That's thirty
metres to fucking carry him.

55:04.720 --> 55:06.609
- You fuck off!
- Bring him on!

55:06.920 --> 55:11.448
We fucking wait! We get them to send in
the ATOs, clear us a fucking path out.

55:11.920 --> 55:18.041
Ammunitions Technical Officer. ATO, fucker.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.643
ATO.

55:22.240 --> 55:24.607
ATO.

55:25.080 --> 55:26.730
What the fuck are they doing?

55:26.840 --> 55:28.968
ATO.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.607
- TO. Take off.
- It's like the fucking YMCA.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.360
ATO.

55:38.520 --> 55:40.648
<i>- Charlie, what's going on?
- They're not moving.</i>

55:40.680 --> 55:42.762
<i>They're signaling something. I can't work it out.</i>

55:42.960 --> 55:44.405
What's going on, mate?

55:44.440 --> 55:46.681
The airframe's here, but we can't
get you fucking over there.

55:46.720 --> 55:47.742
For fuck's sake.

55:48.400 --> 55:52.962
Any call sign, tell the bird
to clear the fuck out of here!

55:55.000 --> 55:58.686
This is a hot HLS, repeat, mines. Over.

55:58.800 --> 56:03.124
They are posing a major risk
to themselves and to us!

56:45.120 --> 56:46.565
Jar Head, SITREP.

56:53.440 --> 56:54.930
Jar Head, SITREP

56:56.880 --> 56:58.405
- Jar Head!
- Yeah?

56:58.440 --> 56:59.805
Fucking SITREP.

57:00.600 --> 57:01.931
Mark's taken it in the chest...

57:03.840 --> 57:05.365
and Stu's been hit again.

57:05.880 --> 57:07.211
And the med's down.

57:07.920 --> 57:08.962
Alex.

57:11.360 --> 57:12.368
Alex?

57:13.640 --> 57:14.707
OK?

57:15.560 --> 57:16.721
OK?

57:22.280 --> 57:25.762
Oi, Jar Head, get him out of here, man.
Fucking get that man up.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.924
Fucking get him out of here. You
do not let that fucking man drop!

57:28.960 --> 57:30.610
Come on man, get your arse over here.

57:31.160 --> 57:33.003
Get him out. Help him out!

57:34.600 --> 57:35.886
It's alright, mate, come on.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.288
Tug!

57:44.080 --> 57:45.127
What do I do?

57:47.040 --> 57:48.565
Tug, what do I fucking do?

57:55.960 --> 57:56.982
Tug!

57:57.920 --> 57:59.684
Tug, what do I fucking do?

58:14.040 --> 58:15.048
...You fu...

58:15.560 --> 58:16.721
Somebody get that...

58:22.520 --> 58:24.568
- I'm fucking dying, man.
- What do I do?

58:24.600 --> 58:26.682
Just hang fucking tight, Mark.

58:27.360 --> 58:28.771
I'm gonna get you out of here.

58:36.560 --> 58:37.607
<i>Come and help me out!</i>

58:37.880 --> 58:38.902
<i>Tug!</i>

58:39.080 --> 58:40.923
Tug, what we doing?

58:42.360 --> 58:43.885
Prosser! Triage!

58:50.280 --> 58:51.805
Prosser! Triage!

58:53.040 --> 58:54.280
Um...

58:54.520 --> 58:58.570
Mark's got wounds to the chest.
It's pretty fucking ugly.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.690
Stu's been hit again but...

59:01.000 --> 59:04.407
- I can't see where, there's fuck loads of blood.
- <i>Where's the fucking chopper?</i>

59:04.560 --> 59:06.528
And Ken's got no fucking idea.

59:08.360 --> 59:09.850
And w-w... what med kit have you got?

59:10.840 --> 59:11.862
Fuck all!

59:12.600 --> 59:15.604
I left the day sack over there.
It's still got a bit of stuff left.

59:15.680 --> 59:17.205
OK, um...

59:18.000 --> 59:22.528
Ken. Ken, should be a day sack near you.
Can you see it?

59:24.440 --> 59:27.728
- Yeah, yeah, it's here.
- Alright, pal. Can you try and reach it for me?

59:34.000 --> 59:35.161
Ken, fucking hell.

59:35.200 --> 59:38.010
- He's gonna set off another...
- Ken, Ken! Don't worry about it, mate.

59:38.040 --> 59:40.441
We'll fucking sack it off, mate. Don't
worry we'll try something else.

59:40.520 --> 59:44.127
- Wait, I'm nearly there.
- Ken, don't do it! No! No, Ken, fucking don't!

59:48.720 --> 59:50.245
I've got it! I've got it!

59:50.680 --> 59:51.747
Oh, God.

59:52.200 --> 59:54.680
OK, what's it got?

59:55.520 --> 59:58.603
IV fluids. Some dressings.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.124
- Two sticks of morphine. That's it.
- Uh, tourniquet. Has it got a tourniquet?

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.960
No, no. That's all there is.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.287
Ken, listen to me.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.122
You need to get those dressings to Mark's chest.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.330
Yeah, you need to make your way over there.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.942
Now, Ken.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.360
OK. OK. OK.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.006
OK. OK. OK.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.283
- OK, I'm here. I'm here.
- Right, then, l want you to use a rifle sling...

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.691
to tourniquet his arm, yeah?

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.811
And that'll stop the bleeding. Alright?

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.963
Ken, catch.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.204
- OK. OK.
- That's it, tourniquet his arm.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.449
And try to cannulate and get some IVs into him.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.286
That's it, tourniquet his arm. Yeah.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.569
No, just stop. Mark. Mark, I've got to!

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.288
- You need to try to cannulate.
- Mark!

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.765
Just a circle, mucker.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.440
Tie it in a circle and put it
round his arm, alright, mate?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.004
Put it round his arm and tie it
tight, it'll stop the bleeding.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.601
Nobody's asking you to do open
fucking heart surgery, Ken.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.880
Where, Prosser!

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.570
Where do you want me to fucking tie it?

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.405
His arm is barely fucking hanging on!

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.802
Mark, please.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.570
Please, Mark, please.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.051
Fuck off!

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.051
Someone get me out.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.771
Fucking hell.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.604
Yeah, yeah, yeah, alright, alright, Ken, Ken, Ken.
Just forget the tourniquet.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.047
Use the t-shirt, plug the fucking hole.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.446
OK, let me...

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.524
Mark, stop. Mark.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.407
- Prosser, where's the fucking Motorola?
- Fucking stop, mate! OK, OK, OK.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.851
Must have gone up with Mark.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.768
Ken. Ken, look at me. You're doing a
fucking great job, alright, mucker.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.764
Ah, fucking hell!

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.211
Fucking wait. Sit, sit down.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.708
Tug.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.805
If you get yourself pinged halfway we've
got ourselves a whole new nightmare.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.322
But I'm the only... I'm the only medic
and this is the only fucking med kit.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.689
You were just telling Smudge not to be a
dick, right don't do anything stupid.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.245
Yeah, but this is stupid.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.524
It is a bit fucking stupid.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.011
Yeah, but I've got a plan.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:18.369
- Listen, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, mate, what is it?

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.862
Come on.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.022
What's up.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.451
It's my fucking lung.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.850
- Fucking hell.
- You're supposed to land on the fucking thing.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.201
Fuck off.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.371
OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.565
OK. OK.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.364
- That's much better.
- Fuck off!

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.209
OK. OK, now.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.811
OK. OK. OK.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.087
Come on you fucking pussy. Fucking hell.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.726
What are you doing, Tug?

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.769
You can shut up, Mark. Before
I change my fucking mind.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.888
It's too fucking dangerous. Stop it.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.564
I need you to put a tube in me.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.807
- What?
- You're a... team medic.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:52.006
Ah, no, mate, no. No, no that was, that was two
days in Belfast, man. Two fucking years ago.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.771
Piece of piss. I put one in
a Terry a few weeks ago.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.086
What's your name?

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.010
- Wha...
- I said...

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.205
- Harvey.
- What's your name?

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.268
Jar Head.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.729
Jar Head. My right lung's collapsed.
If you don't cut me...

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.651
stick this in my chest, I'll
stop breathing and die.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.525
Second rib. Mid clavicular.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.686
I've asked you once, I can't ask again.
Just cut me.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.601
Fucking...

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.570
Halfway, Tug. Fucking awesome.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.763
It's like watching him mount his missus.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.247
Oh, fucking hell... What the fuck am I doing?

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.926
Oh, fuck...

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.010
Oh, fuck it.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.408
Sod's law, you get pinged on the way back, anyhow.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.570
Here... I thought I told you
about not walking into a room

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.409
until you know how you're walking out of there.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:13.371
OK. OK. You can fucking do this. You can
fucking do this. You can fucking do this.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.650
Oh, why the fuck not. You can
fucking do this! Fuck it.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.563
OK. OK.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.371
It's alright. I trust you.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.902
Second rib.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.244
Just go, right.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.809
- Three...
- Hey! Doctor! Coming down.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.160
Ah, fuck's sake.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.651
Thank fuck for that.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.171
Tension pneumothorax.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.405
- What?
- Tension pneumothorax.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.326
Right side. I need it released, now.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.882
Fuck you, fucking fuck.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.507
Sir.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.566
Where's my camera?

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.062
- I need my fucking photos.
- Oi, Tug. Hold him still, buddy.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.829
- He's gonna set off another f...
- Stu, stop fucking moving, mate.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.365
- I need my fucking camera.
- Alright, alright, alright.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.931
We'll get your photos, just
stop fucking moving, please.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.450
Hey, pal, CAS EVAC.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.000
Ken, you got a drink of water,
mate, I'm fucking dying here.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.089
No, no, no, I'm out, mate.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.325
Tug. Have you got any water?

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.727
What? You want me to pop back and get some?

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.627
And water!

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.889
Casualty evacuation, ten minutes.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.843
Barlow. Heads up.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.528
Thank fuck for that.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.247
Here, Mark.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.846
OK. You got it. OK.

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:18.965
- OK, next one.
- CAS EVAC, ten minutes. Yeah.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.126
- Yeah
- Always fucking t...

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.841
God damn it! What the fuck
is going on down there? Huh!

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.801
Ah, fuck!

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:10.850
Ah! fuck it...

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.567
What is so fucking... man!

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:22.207
Fuck! Tug... Tug, fucking help me.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.600
Fucking help me.

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:33.421
OK.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.451
Ken, Ken, I'll get to you when I can, OK?

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.723
There's a tourniquet and a morphine pen, yeah.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.602
- You know what you're fucking doing, lad.
- Tug!

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.245
Be with you in a minute, man.
Be with you in a minute.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.520
Tug, I need some fucking morphine.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.622
OK, OK.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.562
Oh, God!

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.923
I need some fucking morphine.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.044
Yeah, I'm with you, Stu. I'm with you. Prosser!

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.242
- I think my lung's fucked.
- OK, mate.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.326
I need you to lean on your side, don't let
any shit drain into the good one, yeah.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.650
Lean up on that rock there.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.606
Tug, please.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.769
Stu, have a pen, yeah? Find somewhere soft,
give it ten. That's your lot, alright?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.842
Thanks, mate.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.564
What are we going to do with you?

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.281
Fuck,you.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.047
Alright, mate. Alright, OK.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.049
Where's the fucking blood going?

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.404
You're alright, pal. I got you.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.287
Bite down.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.968
...you only stay with us now, OK?

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:07.130
Lad, it's alright. Yeah, take it easy now, alright.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.928
Hold on a minute. Any minute the
helicopter's gonna come, right?

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.171
Stay with us, now, OK?

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.764
Prosser, are we ready?

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.521
Hold on.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.041
Alright, lads.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.246
ZAP numbers on my say, yeah.
Give the medics a head start.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.969
Half a fucking job, Ken. Could have done it
a lot better myself, but it'll do for now.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.685
- It still fucking hurts!
- You've had your left pin nipped off, pal.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.768
It's meant to hurt, but the
morphine'll kick in soon, yeah.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.684
Uh... OK, OK, go.

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.451
Alright, Stu. Go, pal.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.881
I cannae...

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.249
- I cannae fucking remember.
- Don't be a fucking bender, Stu.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.241
It's important information, it
could save your fucking life, pal.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.850
Cool it, Mark, cool it, Mark, cool it.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.961
Stu, go!

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.609
Pearson, Corporal, SH, 3 Para...

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:07.847
Papa, six four three nine. P1, left fucking peg.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.765
Sorry, sorry, wait, Papa what?

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.008
Papa six four three nine.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.805
OK, and a, a left, what?

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.046
Jesus fucking Christ, anyone here speak gangsta?

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.602
Sorry. Right. Got it now.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.164
Ken, you're up next, pal. Go on.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.362
Barlow. Fusilier.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.520
- How about you, mate? How you doing?
- AL.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.327
Ywo RRF.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.761
Yeah, I'm alright. I think I might
get a tan out of this, though.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.091
- Here.
- Bravo five...

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.331
Keep an eye on Stu, yeah. He's
all over the fucking shop.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.321
He's slamming the morphine sticks
like they're fucking voddies.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.921
How's it look?

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.642
Barlow, Fusilier, AL, 2RRF.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.884
- AL? Thought you were called fucking, Ken?
- Bravo five three seven six... P1.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.542
My name's Andy.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.971
- Why you called Ken?
- Ah, don't be a spaz, Tug.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.285
- Ken Barlow?
- Hmmm.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.091
Ken fucking Barlow?

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.844
Ken fucking Barlow!

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.208
OK, OK, pal. Alright, alright.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.329
Here you are, Stu, pal. Let's
get some water on board.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.524
- Hey.
- What, pal?

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.361
- What's your name, scalie?
- Jonesy, Jones.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.009
- It's a shit nickname.
- You do any better?

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.525
- Stu.
- That's not a nickname.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.206
Stu Hale.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.250
Haley. I, uh...

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.370
- I tried to get them to go for Halo.
- Nice.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.291
- But Stu stuck.
- So...

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.569
what do they call the other Stu?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.206
Stu.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.003
Someone needs to look at that.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.210
It's all my fault, isn't it?

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:40.881
No.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.610
- It's not your fault, mate.
- Don't talk like that, mucker.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.087
Think about getting out of here.
Think about your family.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.766
Yeah. Hey, yeah. Have you got any kids?

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:59.130
Hmm. Jimmy. He's, uh... five.
He's, he's a good kid. An...

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.606
And I got another one on the way... Yeah.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.667
Oi, Smudge.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.204
You tell Shannon, yeah...

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.168
You tell her if it's a boy...

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.131
you fucking tell her to call him Alexander, yeah?

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.007
And if it's a girl, call her Sofia.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.083
Would you do that mate, for me, yeah?

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.290
- I need you to fucking do that for me.
- Shut up! No, I'm not gonna tell her that.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.771
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.050
Right, cause if I need to clear a route

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.401
with my bare fucking hands
all the way to Camp Bastion

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.681
I'm getting you out of this gash pit.
Do you hear me?

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.331
And it's not gonna be, what is
it, Sofia, fucking Alexander

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.569
it'll be fucking Smudge Junior, or Smudgella.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.842
And I'll tell you something else, mush,
you're gonna fucking make selection and all.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.687
You're gonna be the first fucking one-legged,
bunny-hopping badge there's ever been, alright?

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:02.009
So none of this fucking platform
four, self-pity fucking bullshit.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.208
We spent too much BST getting you this far.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.325
We haven't given up on you, the least you
could do is not give up on us, you cunt!

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.683
Jesus, Smudge, easy on.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.008
- 'Gash pit'.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.371
Fucking beautiful.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.928
Shit. Tug, it still fucking hurts.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.566
The morphine'll work, pal. You
just got to give it time.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.448
It's been a fucking hour, man.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:53.527
It's been half an hour, Ken. Let
me tell you something, Ken.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.404
The more you shout, the faster your
heartbeat, the quicker you'll bleed out.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.362
Alright, so it's for your own good, and ours,
just shut your fucking jimmy, alright.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.765
OK, OK.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.362
Alright, Mark, I'm just gonna
have another look at this, yeah?

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.961
It's gonna fucking hurt so bite down, mate.

01:18:13.579 --> 01:18:14.679
OK.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.062
OK.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.683
Right, all of you. Just fucking...

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.642
...ignore this next bit, yeah,
ignore what I fucking say.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:41.085
Jay, Smudge. I'm gonna talk shit for a
bit to keep things moving, alright?

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.522
Just fucking... everyone
fucking ignore what I say, OK?

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.568
Right, listen to me, you pricks!

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.771
We've been waiting for this
chopper for three fucking hours.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:00.126
And if it don't come soon, and I'm talking
now, people are gonna start dying down here.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.406
Minutes, alright, that's what we've fucking got.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.448
You have to fucking sort it out!

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.803
C... CAS EVAC. How long?

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.366
Just gonna catch forty winks, lads.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.604
- Stu.
- While Cathy gets her nails done.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.020
- No fucking Kraut's getting this
- Stu, don't go to sleep, man.

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:38.941
deck chair off me.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.603
Unless they want a fucking set to...

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.127
- Stu, you're talking shit, pal.
- I'm up, I'm up.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.462
Sorry, man.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.323
Fuck. I'm back in the room, lads.
I'm back in the room.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.402
Fuck. Hey, lads.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.122
I'd kill anybody right now for
a cold tin of brew, so is.

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.402
That's it, mate. Cheerful fucking thoughts.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:16.005
- Mark, you're getting married, so I hear.
- Hmm. Aye. November.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.002
Just as well lads, think my wanking days are over.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.362
Might need to get my suit re-measured though.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.242
Think she can fucking recognise me?

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.971
Course she fucking will.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.128
- Mark?
- Hm. Aye?

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.566
You gonna, you gonna have a big piss-up afters?

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:55.027
Oh, you bet you. Uh... Minto Hotel.
Bells and whistles.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.162
Yeah?

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.091
If we get out of this, you...
you lads are all coming, yeah.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.966
- Cash bar?
- Fuck you.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.890
Fucking cash bar.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:05.807
Fucking arse.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.322
Free bar, fuck, free bar.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.363
Ah, fucking hell. That's diamond.
I'm gonna fucking go all out.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.640
Aye?

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.771
I haven't been legless since February.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.725
You don't need to fucking worry
about that anymore, do you, Barlow?

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.886
Ah, I'm gonna be fucking legless every night, now.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.286
Ken Barlow.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.931
Hey, lads. I just realised, we don't need
to worry about the third mine anymore.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:43.169
Good old Ken's fucking found it for us.
Cheers Ken!

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.322
- Always getting dicked, mate.
- The really funny thing is, boys...

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.204
...they didn't get fucking planted here,
they all just washed off the hill

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.771
and down to the river beds. There
could be fucking hundreds of them...

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.684
All around here. All around us.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.207
Great place for a fucking bimble, lads.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.520
Quick snipe, then it's tea and fucking medals.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.165
CAS EVAC, ten minutes.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.721
Um...

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.765
what's his name... fucking, um... Jeffery Dahmer?

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.449
No. Two more.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.686
Jack the Ripper.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.364
No. Last guess, make it a good one.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.648
- Come on, give me, give me some more...
- Eh? What did you say? 'Rules is rules,' Stu.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.403
I just had my fucking leg blown off, mate.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:58.604
Is that how it's gonna be now? 'Oh, my poor leg.
Oi, lend us a quid, Smudge.'

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.007
Alright, fuck off.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.448
- Hannibal Lector?
- Nah.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.446
Let's call it quits.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.521
Harold Shipman.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.406
Harold fucking who?

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.043
Harold Shipman, the doctor of death.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.405
No, I've never heard of him.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.208
Of course you have. He killed, like...
two-hundred people, maybe more.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.608
- He's not, like, fucking world famous, is he?
- He's from your neck of the woods.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.210
You know exactly who I'm talking about.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:38.723
- Well, there's not a fucking plaque to him.
- He's up there. You'd be surprised.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.160
We're never getting out of here.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.609
I reckon you made him up.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.567
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.890
Kenneth Arthur Barlow.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.407
Hey, Ken!

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:18.231
- It still fucking hurts.
- Yeah, that's good, mucker.

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.930
If it's hurting it means
you're alive, mate. Alright?

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.702
Stu.

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.286
Stu, punch your card.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.689
- My camera...
- ...Fucking camera, pal.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.884
I need more fucking morphine.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.847
You take the pain, Stu. You're
a big lad, you'll be alright.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.148
Mark?

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.927
No fucking snoozing, boys, yeah?

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:04.089
- Prosser? You with us?
- Yeah.

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.244
Y... yeah. Yeah.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.165
Keep talking to me, Prosser.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.011
Talk about what?

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.127
You tell me, pal.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.445
We could talk about the weather.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.130
Short, fucking conversation.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:27.521
T... tell you what... I'm trying to think
if I've had worse birthdays than this.

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.365
And I've had some shit ones.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.248
When I was eight, my...

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.368
mum and dad clean out fucking forgot.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.528
All day long I was thinking...
they're just pretending.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.402
They're gonna spring this
monster fucking surprise on me.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.248
Even when I'm having me tea...

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.804
in the bath...

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.762
getting into fucking bed...

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.962
I'm thinking, 'Oh, these guys are good.'

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.365
Then they shut the door, turned out the lights...

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.925
and that was it.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.888
I cried like a burst fucking drain.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.685
- Then they came back in, though, yeah?
- No.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.126
No. They fucking forgot.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.765
But this is shitter.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.368
Well, we can do something
about that, can't we boys?

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.841
Stu.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.243
Ken, Mark.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.328
Happy birthday to you!

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:49.964
Right, come on boys, fucking loud, Stu.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.126
Happy birthday to you!

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.268
Louder!

01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:01.568
Happy birthday, David Prosser,
happy birthday to you!

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.606
One more time, boys, loud. Nice
and loud, let him hear you.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.128
Happy birthday to you!

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.241
- Ken, let's hear you.
- OK.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.045
Happy birthday to you.

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:19.409
Happy birthday, David Prosser,
happy birthday to you!

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:26.768
<i>Happy birthday to you. Happy bir...</i>

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.365
Tug. Stay on fucking target, man.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.121
My leg still fucking hurts.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.125
Tug, this fucking morphine isn't working.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.765
There ain't no more, Ken.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.908
Tug.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.930
Tug, give me another stick.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.570
Don't you fucking drop.

01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:48.825
Just fucking give me it, pal.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.846
Don't you drop, Stu. Don't you dare fucking drop.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.091
You hang in there, mate.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.324
You fucking hear me?

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:04.081
We're 3 Para and we're going
to get through this together.

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:09.687
We are 3 fucking Para.

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.601
Remember the fucking history, boys.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:16.770
Arnhem, Mount Longdon.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.370
Fucking Kajaki, now.

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.290
We are 3 fucking Para.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.083
Don't you dare fucking drop.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.646
We are 3 fucking Para.

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.650
Utrinque Paratus. 'Ready for fucking anything'.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.331
You fucking hear me?

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.761
Oh, Lancashire... is wonderful!

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:22.005
Oh, Lancashire is wonderful!

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.930
It's full of tits...

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.810
fanny and wanderers.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:32.601
Oh, Lancashire is wonderful...

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.327
Water?

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.848
- What?
- Water.

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.887
There we go.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.961
That's it, pal.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.530
- OK?
- I'm good. I'm finished. Fucking...

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.531
it's disgusting, man.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.444
Hey, give us a minute, man. I think I've got
a bottle of champagne in the fucking bag.

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.205
Looks like you're out of luck, mate.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:35.969
- It's funny...
- What's that?

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:42.003
My mum always said I was born under a lucky star.

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.288
How?

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:51.565
Kept on winning things, you
know, like raffles and stuff.

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.708
Yeah.

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.809
I won her a pair of diamond
earrings at the Sabre Centre.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.002
She always wore them when I came home.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.249
And I've always felt lucky.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.086
My life.

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.121
My job.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.326
Gill.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:22.841
So lucky.

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.204
You're no' fucking wrong, Mark.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.088
You're the luckiest guy I know, mate.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.368
You could sail through a shit storm, buddy...

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:43.445
and come out smelling of fuckin' roses. Eh?

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.441
There you go.

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:57.008
You'll come out of this as well, too, pal.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.607
I think my luck's run out, guys.

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:06.289
No, pal, you just gotta... you just gotta hold on.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.286
Just hold on, pal.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.240
I'm cold, Tug.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.524
I'm fucking cold.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.041
Not long now, Mark. We'll have you out of here.

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:29.682
- I'm going, I can feel it, I'm fucking dying...
- No, you're... you're not.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.727
- I am.
- No, you're not. You're alright... Fine...

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.290
Tell Gill that I love her.

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:55.766
Tell her I want her to be happy...
want her to marry some other fella.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.764
I ain't fuckin'... Shut up with all that shit now.

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:04.770
Tell my mum and dad that I love them.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.127
Tell them have a piss-up on me at the Minto.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.041
No cash bar.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.564
Tell them to look after my dog.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.402
- You fuckin' getting this?
- I'm with you.

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.930
Shut the fuck up, Mark.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.890
This time next week, mate...

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.846
...we're gonna be drinking
cold lager in the Fox, buddy.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.048
Telling our fuckin' war stories.

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.282
Impressin' the fuckin' locals, eh?

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:52.129
Tell my uncle that I died being a
good soldier, yeah? A good Para.

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.770
Would do, mate, but you're not
fuckin' dying, eh, you big squeeze.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:17.284
- We'll get you out of here...
- Yeah.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.922
Just fuckin' hold on, pal. Eh?

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.601
You hold on.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.045
- Fuck!
- Fuck! No! Fuck!

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.400
Cover up!

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.682
Tell him it's a fuckin' minefield!

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.885
- It's a minefield.
- It's a fucking minefield!

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.931
...fuckin' minefield! Hey!

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.963
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa! No!

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.407
