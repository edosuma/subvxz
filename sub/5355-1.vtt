00:34.868 --> 00:37.078
NARRATOR: This is how it begins.

00:37.203 --> 00:42.082
A motorcycle racer
and his crew chief

00:42.207 --> 00:43.458
looking for speed.

00:54.469 --> 00:57.221
STEFANO:
I'm thinking how to corner well

00:57.346 --> 00:59.264
with my knee to the ground

00:59.389 --> 01:01.057
how the crew chief has explained.

01:01.182 --> 01:03.309
It's difficult.

01:16.655 --> 01:18.156
This is how it begins.

01:18.281 --> 01:23.202
A motorcycle racer and his crew chief.

01:23.327 --> 01:26.663
And his race engineers
and his suspension engineer

01:26.788 --> 01:31.000
and his tire engineer
and his electronics engineer

01:31.125 --> 01:32.292
and his mechanics,

01:32.417 --> 01:35.169
looking for speed.

01:37.671 --> 01:41.591
From the smallest minimoto track
to the fastest grand prix circuit,

01:41.716 --> 01:44.093
from little bikes
that cost a few hundred

01:44.218 --> 01:47.012
to MotoGP missiles that cost millions.

01:47.137 --> 01:49.389
From 20-mile-an-hour childhood thrills

01:49.514 --> 01:53.267
to 220-mile-an-hour
grand prix battles.

01:53.392 --> 01:55.894
The principle remains the same.

01:56.019 --> 01:58.229
Find the fastest line around the track.

01:58.354 --> 02:01.565
And then figure out how to go faster.

02:03.441 --> 02:08.237
Grand prix motorcycle racing is
the process of turning fire into speed.

02:09.112 --> 02:11.739
The combustion of fuel
and air in the engine

02:11.864 --> 02:17.452
and the fire in the heart of a rider
willing to risk everything to win.

02:18.828 --> 02:20.579
Time is the enemy.

02:20.704 --> 02:24.124
The fractions of a second
lost or gained in every corner

02:24.249 --> 02:26.876
which add up to defeat or victory.

02:27.001 --> 02:30.087
And the few years that you have
to make it to the top

02:30.212 --> 02:32.672
and try to stay there.

02:32.797 --> 02:35.549
This is what you have to do.

02:35.674 --> 02:37.926
Brake as late as possible.

02:39.969 --> 02:41.762
Stay wide.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.889
Turn.

02:44.014 --> 02:47.183
Hit the apex. Accelerate.

02:47.308 --> 02:49.143
Brake.

02:49.268 --> 02:52.145
Lean... further.

02:53.146 --> 02:54.438
Faster.

02:54.563 --> 02:57.691
Stay on the motorcycle.

02:57.816 --> 03:00.527
Hit the apex. Accelerate.

03:02.278 --> 03:04.655
Stay on the motorcycle.

03:07.866 --> 03:10.326
Crashing... hurts.

03:12.995 --> 03:14.413
It wrecks your bike.

03:16.039 --> 03:17.915
It wrecks your body.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.671
It wrecks your chances.

03:30.885 --> 03:34.722
Stay... on... the bike.

03:36.598 --> 03:37.599
And fight.

03:44.897 --> 03:46.023
Every lap.

03:48.066 --> 03:49.317
Every corner.

03:52.111 --> 03:53.612
Every second.

04:00.118 --> 04:01.619
In 18 races around the world.

04:03.746 --> 04:09.042
Flat out
for over 2,000 miles each season.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.797
Fight to the finish.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.757
Fight to the top.

04:20.801 --> 04:21.843
Fight.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.736
This is the story of six fighters.

04:41.445 --> 04:45.198
Six of the fastest motorcycle racers
of all time

04:45.323 --> 04:48.159
and of the fates that awaited them
at the peak of the sport.

04:49.034 --> 04:53.246
When the speeds had never been higher,
the competition more intense

04:53.371 --> 04:56.749
or the talent on the track
more brilliant.

04:57.916 --> 05:00.418
It's the story of what is at stake
for all of them.

05:00.543 --> 05:02.836
All that can be won.

05:02.961 --> 05:06.089
And all that can be lost,
when you go chasing glory

05:06.214 --> 05:10.468
at over 200 miles an hour
on a motorcycle.

06:14.365 --> 06:17.868
LORENZO: I love sleep. I love sleeping.

06:17.993 --> 06:20.161
Marco, my helper, wakes me up.

06:21.579 --> 06:24.498
So I take some breakfast.

06:25.499 --> 06:29.211
I just feel that I'm more nervous
than on Saturday.

06:30.253 --> 06:33.714
You start feeling the butterflies
in your stomach.

06:33.839 --> 06:35.257
I hate this feeling.

06:36.258 --> 06:39.636
You feel more tired.
You feel... You are less strong.

07:04.410 --> 07:07.788
MARQUEZ: Wake up, breakfast, warm up.

07:07.913 --> 07:12.083
Normally I sleep well but that time
I will be a little bit nervous.

07:16.212 --> 07:19.215
ROSSI: Sunday morning,
the feeling is always the same.

07:19.340 --> 07:23.385
Scary, fear, adrenaline.

07:23.510 --> 07:28.515
Think positive,
but also scary to make some mistake.

07:28.640 --> 07:32.769
Together, the worst
and the best moment of my life.

07:33.436 --> 07:35.646
WOMAN:
Valentino, you're so handsome!

07:49.868 --> 07:53.371
NARRATOR: The countdown
to the MotoGP race at two o'clock

07:53.496 --> 07:57.041
is punctuated
by the roar of the support events...

07:57.166 --> 07:58.792
The junior class at 11.

07:58.917 --> 08:00.835
The intermediate at 12.20.

08:02.711 --> 08:04.129
Then it's time.

08:04.254 --> 08:06.339
PEDROSA: There are many things
out of your control.

08:06.464 --> 08:09.008
These are the things
that make you a bit uncomfortable

08:09.133 --> 08:13.053
in that particular hour
before the race.

08:15.722 --> 08:17.640
WOMAN: I enjoy it.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.893
It's great to see my son
get to the top.

08:21.018 --> 08:21.977
But you also suffer.

08:22.102 --> 08:26.064
As parents, we are afraid

08:26.189 --> 08:27.565
because it's very dangerous.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.733
MAN: The danger's inevitable.

08:29.858 --> 08:32.318
It's motor racing on two wheels
at very high speeds.

08:32.443 --> 08:34.570
We're always trying
to make it better.

08:34.695 --> 08:37.948
We're working on rider equipment.
The airbags inside the leathers.

08:38.073 --> 08:40.450
And then the rules that I apply

08:40.575 --> 08:44.370
to not allow the riders
to do things that put them in danger.

08:48.665 --> 08:51.250
NARRATOR: The road to the MotoGP
world championship

08:51.375 --> 08:54.378
is long, difficult and dangerous.

08:54.503 --> 08:58.006
It must be taken at maximum speed
at all times.

08:59.048 --> 09:01.425
The finish line is thousands of miles,

09:01.550 --> 09:05.136
hundreds of races and hundreds
of crashes from the start.

09:06.679 --> 09:11.517
Thousands of young riders go racing
each year in Europe, Asia and America,

09:11.642 --> 09:14.353
dreaming of a place on the world stage.

09:16.396 --> 09:18.606
Very few of them will get there.

09:22.026 --> 09:25.195
Nobody knows
the ferocity of the competition

09:25.320 --> 09:26.612
better than Valentino Rossi.

09:28.155 --> 09:32.325
He's raced in over 300 grand prix
since 1996,

09:32.450 --> 09:37.204
won over 100 of them
and taken nine world championships.

09:37.329 --> 09:40.332
He made it to MotoGP
the way most of them do,

09:40.457 --> 09:43.418
rising through the junior
and intermediate classes,

09:43.543 --> 09:46.796
learning the grand prix tracks
on 140-mile-an-hour bikes.

09:46.921 --> 09:50.299
Then 170-mile-an-hour bikes

09:50.424 --> 09:52.509
before the move to MotoGP

09:52.634 --> 09:54.427
and over 200 miles an hour.

09:55.428 --> 10:00.433
Year after year, he's fought off
wave after wave of challengers.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.852
Over 100 riders have come and gone
in his time at the top.

10:03.977 --> 10:09.899
Rossi is the only one left
from the MotoGP class of 2000.

10:10.024 --> 10:16.196
From 2001 to 2005, he won
five MotoGP championships in a row.

10:16.321 --> 10:19.824
COMMENTATOR: Rossi goes through and
there's nothing Biaggi can do about it.

10:19.949 --> 10:23.202
Oh! They touched! He's wide!

10:23.327 --> 10:25.412
Oh, Rossi's pushing him off the track!

10:25.537 --> 10:28.623
Rossi's gonna take victory
in the Spanish cup.

10:30.207 --> 10:33.126
NARRATOR: He was
the undisputed king of the sport.

10:33.251 --> 10:38.589
At the end of the decade
he was still fighting, still winning.

10:38.714 --> 10:43.218
One more premier class title
and he would equal the all-time record.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.928
One more step to cementing his status

10:46.053 --> 10:49.681
as the greatest motorcycle racer
of all time.

10:50.390 --> 10:54.894
But by 2010, Rossi had his hands full.

10:55.019 --> 10:57.771
The men who could beat him had arrived.

10:58.980 --> 11:00.564
If you'd known where to look,

11:00.689 --> 11:03.274
you could have seen them
coming for him all along.

11:07.653 --> 11:09.655
1994, Spain.

11:09.780 --> 11:12.532
Seven-year-old Jorge Lorenzo

11:12.657 --> 11:16.452
slips and slides his way
around a car park in Mallorca.

11:19.288 --> 11:23.083
COMMENTATOR: Casey Stoner on 166.
Keep your eyes on Casey.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.627
NARRATOR: 1997, Australia.

11:25.752 --> 11:29.672
Twelve-year-old Casey Stoner
leads the pack in a dirt-track race.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.567
COMMENTATOR: Casey Stoner 166
with that nice comfortable lead.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.903
NARRATOR: He led hundreds
of dirt-track races there.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.447
He once won 32 in a single weekend.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.116
COMMENTATOR: That's a very easy win
in event number five.

11:45.829 --> 11:48.540
NARRATOR: 1999, Italy.

11:48.665 --> 11:53.211
12-year-old Marco Simoncelli wins
the national Minimoto championship.

11:53.961 --> 11:57.714
The same competition
Rossi started his career in.

11:58.506 --> 12:02.927
2000, Casey Stoner's family takes
all their savings and moves to Europe.

12:03.052 --> 12:06.263
Racing on asphalt for the first time,

12:06.388 --> 12:10.725
Stoner finds himself up against
the fastest rider he's ever seen.

12:10.850 --> 12:14.395
Dani Pedrosa,
from Sabadell near Barcelona.

12:16.271 --> 12:20.525
Ten years later, the new generation
are all on the grid with Rossi.

12:23.236 --> 12:25.529
Almost all of them, that is.

12:25.654 --> 12:30.408
There's another very fast one coming
none of them know about yet.

12:31.951 --> 12:36.205
1997, Cervera, Spain.

12:36.330 --> 12:39.791
Marc Marquez gets
a motorcycle for Christmas.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.543
He is three years old.

12:44.586 --> 12:49.299
Casey Stoner stunned Valentino Rossi
and everybody else in 2007,

12:49.424 --> 12:51.884
his second year in MotoGP.

12:52.009 --> 12:55.470
The Australian didn't just beat Rossi
to the world title that year,

12:55.595 --> 12:57.471
he wiped the floor with him,

12:57.596 --> 13:00.015
taking ten victories
to the Italian's four.

13:00.140 --> 13:01.683
(CHEERING)

13:06.854 --> 13:11.149
Yamaha then signed Jorge Lorenzo
as their second rider for 2008.

13:11.274 --> 13:15.528
It was a statement.
Rossi was the past.

13:15.653 --> 13:18.155
Lorenzo was the future.

13:18.738 --> 13:22.825
In 2010, the 23-year-old
rode a perfect season.

13:22.950 --> 13:26.745
He finished every race,
took nine wins and seven podiums

13:26.870 --> 13:30.999
and scored more points
than anybody in history.

13:31.124 --> 13:33.084
MAN: I saw it when he was five.

13:33.209 --> 13:36.045
It was impressive how he could ride

13:36.170 --> 13:38.839
beyond logic,
beyond the laws of physics almost.

13:38.964 --> 13:40.840
When you see that in a child

13:40.965 --> 13:43.801
you know there is great potential

13:43.926 --> 13:46.678
to go very far in this sport.

13:46.803 --> 13:49.388
He had it and other things besides.

13:49.513 --> 13:52.432
He's very stubborn.
He's very hard-working.

13:52.557 --> 13:55.226
He sticks at thngs
until he achieves them.

13:55.351 --> 13:57.186
He's a non-conformist.
A perfectionist.

13:57.311 --> 14:03.442
And of all that together
with the right circumstances

14:03.567 --> 14:05.360
has enabled him
to reach the level he's now at.

14:06.277 --> 14:09.029
NARRATOR: Dani Pedrosa excelled
on the smaller bikes,

14:09.154 --> 14:10.822
winning three titles.

14:14.450 --> 14:19.746
In MotoGP, the diminutive Spaniard
finished second to Stoner in 2007

14:19.871 --> 14:22.957
and second again to Lorenzo in 2010,

14:23.082 --> 14:26.126
pushing Rossi down to third
in the championship standings.

14:27.293 --> 14:30.921
With Valentino Rossi in
apparent decline at the age of 31,

14:31.046 --> 14:34.340
Italy is looking for a new MotoGP hero.

14:34.465 --> 14:36.800
Enter Marco Simoncelli.

14:38.176 --> 14:40.970
I took him to ride mini bikes.

14:41.095 --> 14:43.931
I didn't take him to piano classes.

14:44.056 --> 14:45.599
(LAUGHS)

14:45.724 --> 14:49.352
He loved it. It was easy.

14:49.477 --> 14:52.897
The first race, he fell three times.
He didn't win.

14:53.022 --> 14:56.900
But he learned fast.

14:57.025 --> 14:59.277
All of them, I've seen all his races.

14:59.402 --> 15:04.490
Little by little, with difficulty,
with many concerns,

15:04.615 --> 15:07.951
we got where he wanted to be.

15:11.663 --> 15:15.208
From his determination
and the way he rode

15:15.333 --> 15:18.002
we always knew he would be great.

15:19.378 --> 15:21.046
Me and his mum.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.259
NARRATOR: Racing
in the intermediate class,

15:27.384 --> 15:30.303
Simoncelli took six victories in 2008

15:30.428 --> 15:33.556
and clinched the world title
in the tropical heat of Malaysia.

15:36.267 --> 15:38.894
MAN: Marco, how does that sound,
to be world champion?

15:39.019 --> 15:40.812
It's wonderful.

15:40.937 --> 15:44.315
I... I...

15:45.441 --> 15:47.860
I can't speak.

15:47.985 --> 15:50.404
I am too hot. I'm sorry.

15:50.529 --> 15:53.240
MAN: Congratulations anyway, Marco.
Thanks very much.

15:53.365 --> 15:56.076
It's wonderful. Grazie tutti.

15:57.118 --> 15:58.452
Scusati.

16:02.205 --> 16:04.874
NARRATOR: Marco Simoncelli
lived in Coriano,

16:04.999 --> 16:08.127
a few miles from Valentino Rossi's home
in Tavullia.

16:08.252 --> 16:09.795
Eight years Rossi's junior,

16:09.920 --> 16:13.340
he sharpened his skills
on the same twisting roads

16:13.465 --> 16:15.758
that the world champion
had ridden as a teenager.

16:15.883 --> 16:20.262
And over time, the world champion
became a friend and mentor.

16:20.387 --> 16:25.475
ROSSI: From 2007,
I passed a lot of time with him.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.811
Every day at the gym,
motocross, go-kart.

16:28.936 --> 16:30.687
A lot a lot together.

16:30.812 --> 16:33.397
Yeah, he was my best friend
in the paddock.

16:33.522 --> 16:36.399
Our relationship become more deep.

16:39.068 --> 16:42.488
NARRATOR: The doors to MotoGP
opened for Simoncelli.

16:42.613 --> 16:46.116
He made his debut in 2010
with Fausto Gresini's team.

16:47.450 --> 16:50.828
Like everybody before him,
he struggled.

16:50.953 --> 16:56.458
At first he had some trouble
and he crashed a few times.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.918
But moving from two-stroke engines
to four-stroke engines,

16:59.043 --> 17:03.547
going from one way of working
to another takes time.

17:04.047 --> 17:06.549
NARRATOR:
It's a huge leap in performance.

17:06.674 --> 17:11.345
From a top speed of around 170 miles
per hour in the intermediate class

17:11.470 --> 17:14.138
to over 220 in MotoGP.

17:14.263 --> 17:18.893
A MotoGP bike accelerates
faster than a Formula 1 car.

17:19.018 --> 17:21.228
Crashing can mean
flying through the air

17:21.353 --> 17:23.771
faster than a free-falling skydiver.

17:24.481 --> 17:27.483
A 200-mile-an-hour landing survivable

17:27.608 --> 17:31.362
as long as you hit the ground
at a shallow angle and slide.

17:35.240 --> 17:41.663
At the beginning of the season,
we were in big trouble with the bike.

17:42.705 --> 17:45.874
Step-by-step, we improved every race.

17:45.999 --> 17:51.754
And now the last three races for me
are so positive,

17:51.879 --> 17:55.257
I hope to end the season
in the best way

17:55.382 --> 17:58.385
and to step up on the podium.

17:58.510 --> 18:01.429
COMMENTATOR: There is Marco Simoncelli.
Simoncelli is gonna do it.

18:01.554 --> 18:05.057
COMMENTATOR 2: No!
Dovizioso has so much more drive

18:05.182 --> 18:07.267
coming out of the Parabolica.

18:11.437 --> 18:15.315
COMMENTATOR: Well done, Simoncelli.
He's going to be disappointed.

18:18.318 --> 18:20.611
That's his dad, isn't it?
Giving him a big hug.

18:20.736 --> 18:24.156
Marco Simoncelli, we're gonna see
a lot of you next season.

18:24.281 --> 18:27.575
I don't think there's any doubt
about that. Great ride.

18:29.618 --> 18:31.119
NARRATOR: By the end of the year,

18:31.244 --> 18:33.955
Simoncelli had emerged
as one of the fastest of them all.

18:35.247 --> 18:38.667
He hadn't won a race yet,
but he'd won a lot of hearts.

18:38.792 --> 18:42.045
He was just what many people wanted
in a motorcycle racer,

18:42.170 --> 18:45.840
a demon on the bike
and a nice guy off it.

18:45.965 --> 18:50.219
SIMONCELLI: I'm happy
for the big improvement that I do

18:50.344 --> 18:52.471
with my team during this year.

18:52.596 --> 18:55.807
And the results
coming better and better.

18:55.932 --> 18:58.309
And now we hope to continue in this way.

18:58.434 --> 19:01.019
NARRATOR:
At the final race in Valencia,

19:01.144 --> 19:03.563
he qualified on the front row
for the first time,

19:03.688 --> 19:05.690
ready to take on anyone,

19:05.815 --> 19:09.193
including newly-crowned
world champion Jorge Lorenzo.

19:09.318 --> 19:12.904
COMMENTATOR: Jorge Lorenzo
fights back against Marco Simoncelli

19:13.029 --> 19:14.488
and gets up the inside.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.406
Simoncelli fights back immediately.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.658
COMMENTATOR 2:
He loves to be aggressive, doesn't he?

19:18.783 --> 19:22.036
I read something he tell
about my riding style,

19:22.161 --> 19:28.208
but, I don't know,
for me he said some wrong things...

19:28.333 --> 19:32.795
Because he said I touch him
and maybe he crashed.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.547
COMMENTATAOR: Lorenzo dives
for the inside line and touches!

19:35.672 --> 19:38.299
Oh, he was almost down!
And he was just hanging on.

19:38.424 --> 19:41.385
Lorenzo is absolutely furious!

19:41.510 --> 19:47.224
I was in front and he tried to pass me
and he did a mistake.

19:47.349 --> 19:48.892
He hurt me.

19:50.310 --> 19:56.733
His tire was on my leather
from the leg to the shoulder.

19:56.858 --> 19:59.569
So for me it's not a correct example.

20:00.278 --> 20:01.821
It's working? Yeah?

20:02.905 --> 20:07.451
For my side, I think yesterday
I speak the right words.

20:08.535 --> 20:10.328
And for me, it's not a problem.

20:10.453 --> 20:13.205
If in the future, it doesn't happen
anything, it's not a problem.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.248
We'll see what happens in the future.

20:16.749 --> 20:20.753
Yes, but you did
a wrong example for me.

20:20.878 --> 20:22.713
(LAUGHTER)

20:22.838 --> 20:27.509
I think you have a lot of touching
with a lot of riders.

20:27.634 --> 20:30.470
Yes, but the example
was wrong for me.

20:30.595 --> 20:36.017
How many races I doesn't crash?
I don't touch any rider.

20:36.142 --> 20:39.103
I said that your example was wrong.
Sorry, eh?

20:39.228 --> 20:40.979
This is your opinion.

20:41.104 --> 20:43.272
But I think a lot of people
here in the paddock,

20:43.397 --> 20:45.524
a lot of riders
have the same opinion of me.

20:45.649 --> 20:46.858
Try to ask.

20:46.983 --> 20:48.651
Ask Dovizioso for example...

20:48.776 --> 20:53.489
For example, ask Dovizioso in 2005.

20:53.614 --> 20:56.325
It doesn't matter.
If in the future it doesn't happen,

20:56.450 --> 20:57.659
it's not a problem for me.

20:57.784 --> 21:00.995
But in the future if something
happens with you, will be a problem.

21:02.037 --> 21:04.539
OK. I will be arrested.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.249
(LAUGHTER)

21:12.188 --> 21:16.901
MAN: OK, let's quiet...
Let's calm down a little bit.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.027
Sorry.

21:18.152 --> 21:21.155
MAN: No, you and Marco, that is fine.
That's no problem.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.322
I can speak?

21:22.447 --> 21:24.365
MAN: Of course you can speak. Please.

21:24.490 --> 21:27.117
No. This question...
Everybody's laughing...

21:29.160 --> 21:34.123
But it's not funny
because we are playing with our lives.

21:34.248 --> 21:36.416
We are riding at 300 per hour.

21:36.541 --> 21:41.254
With bikes, very powerful
and very heavy.

21:41.379 --> 21:43.798
It's not mini-bikes.

21:43.923 --> 21:46.508
So, it's a dangerous sport.

21:46.633 --> 21:48.676
And you have to think
what do you do.

21:54.765 --> 21:56.683
NARRATOR: At the highest level,

21:56.808 --> 22:00.770
motorcycle racing
is a display of dangerous brilliance.

22:00.895 --> 22:05.190
The performance of death-defying feats
of skill and daring.

22:05.315 --> 22:07.317
That is the underlying contest.

22:07.442 --> 22:10.778
A dance with potential destruction.

22:10.903 --> 22:12.195
You know that this is dangerous.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.406
When you ride at 100%,
you always risk.

22:15.531 --> 22:20.744
but when you have the feeling
that the situation is under control,

22:20.869 --> 22:24.163
you can push the last 10%.

22:25.122 --> 22:26.915
STONER: We know the dangers of racing.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.125
You need to respect
the riders next to you.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.460
You don't know
the last time you'll see them.

22:31.585 --> 22:34.963
We go into races knowing it can happen.
You don't think about it.

22:35.088 --> 22:38.174
If that starts creeping in your mind,
then you leave.

22:38.299 --> 22:41.760
You've gotta take risks
to stay in the game.

22:42.677 --> 22:46.597
NARRATOR: When you run the numbers,
the odds are on the riders' side.

22:46.722 --> 22:50.475
Over an 18-race season,
the practice sessions and races

22:50.600 --> 22:54.895
in the three MotoGP classes
produce hundreds of crashes.

22:55.020 --> 23:00.442
Serious injuries are limited
to a few broken bones most of the time.

23:00.567 --> 23:02.610
Do you know how many crashes
there have been this year?

23:02.735 --> 23:07.614
Six hundred and ninety.
Six hundred and ninety crashes.

23:07.739 --> 23:11.075
Fractures and so on?
I don't know, about 30.

23:13.619 --> 23:19.082
ROSSI: In my career, also when I was
young, I don't take a lot of risks.

23:19.207 --> 23:23.044
I take risks,
but not more than necessary.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.547
Graziano took a lot more risks then me.

23:26.672 --> 23:30.717
NARRATOR: Valentino Rossi's father
Graziano was a grand prix rider

23:30.842 --> 23:34.178
in the Seventies and Eighties
who retired through injury.

23:34.303 --> 23:36.930
ROSSI: Growing up, I learned from him.

23:37.055 --> 23:41.726
The son learned
from the father's mistakes.

23:42.518 --> 23:47.022
Bad memories, a lot of crashes,
a lot of injuries.

23:47.147 --> 23:50.316
So, yes, it's scary
because he's my father.

23:51.442 --> 23:55.446
NARRATOR: It will happen.
Learning means crashing.

23:55.571 --> 23:57.239
When you're out
to extract the maximum

23:57.364 --> 24:01.868
from a 240-horsepower motorcycle,
there's no other way.

24:02.743 --> 24:05.954
Go over the limit
and then you know where it is.

24:06.079 --> 24:08.998
A fast rider
can learn to stop crashing.

24:09.123 --> 24:11.458
A slow rider cannot learn to go fast.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.544
You have to do it. You have to crash.

24:15.669 --> 24:19.464
And you have to learn from it
if you want to stay around.

24:21.424 --> 24:26.095
There's many examples in this world
of a very fast rider, but not smart.

24:26.220 --> 24:29.681
And their career's been very short.
To be fast is not enough.

24:29.806 --> 24:32.642
You need to have a combination
of being fast and brave

24:32.767 --> 24:34.685
and also be intelligent.

24:34.810 --> 24:36.686
NARRATOR: In his rookie year in MotoGP,

24:36.811 --> 24:40.731
Jorge Lorenzo once crashed
three times in a single weekend.

24:40.856 --> 24:42.774
LORENZO: I thought I was invincible.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.610
And I was not afraid to get hurt.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.279
I was not afraid
of these kind of bikes,

24:49.404 --> 24:52.532
going at 340 kilometers per hour.
I didn't care.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.951
It was a normal thing
to crash so many times.

25:05.043 --> 25:10.256
And then suddenly I realize,
OK, I need to stop.

25:10.381 --> 25:13.425
I need to change my mentality.
I need to be more calm.

25:13.550 --> 25:18.096
I need to... to think more on the bike.

25:18.221 --> 25:25.228
CHICO: We've been looking at the
training that American fighter pilots do

25:25.353 --> 25:30.941
and also how
the Israeli special forces train.

25:31.066 --> 25:33.818
The theory is that it's all in the mind

25:33.943 --> 25:38.489
so we work directly
with the mind of the rider.

25:39.239 --> 25:42.575
NARRATOR: There is no correct way
to ride a MotoGP machine.

25:42.700 --> 25:46.704
The objective is to go as fast
as possible and stay on the bike.

25:46.829 --> 25:49.623
How you do that is up to you.

25:49.748 --> 25:52.041
STONER: I came from dirt tracks.
I came from sliding.

25:52.166 --> 25:55.711
I'm more than comfortable
when the bike's going sideways.

25:55.836 --> 25:58.004
NARRATOR:
It's one of the mysteries of the sport.

25:58.129 --> 26:02.466
How two riders with styles
as different as Stoner's and Lorenzo's

26:02.591 --> 26:04.843
can go round a three-mile race track

26:04.968 --> 26:07.637
within a thousandth of a second
of each other.

26:07.762 --> 26:10.514
Stoner sideways, shaking and sliding.

26:10.639 --> 26:13.099
Lorenzo as if on rails.

26:13.224 --> 26:17.019
LORENZO: I'm pushing 100%
and I'm going at the maximum.

26:17.144 --> 26:22.149
I am feeling the limit in every corner.
I'm trying to be perfect.

26:25.944 --> 26:28.738
(CHURCH BELLS RING)

26:28.863 --> 26:30.781
NARRATOR: Every time he won
a grand prix,

26:30.906 --> 26:35.076
the church bells in Rossi's home town
rang out in celebration.

26:35.201 --> 26:40.164
105 times from 1996 to 2010.

26:41.623 --> 26:43.166
Then he moved to Ducati.

26:44.167 --> 26:46.377
And the bells stopped ringing.

26:47.753 --> 26:50.964
Ducati was an experience.

26:51.089 --> 26:55.968
Let's not say a happy experience.

26:56.093 --> 26:58.303
He suffered.

26:58.428 --> 27:02.181
NARRATOR: When Jorge Lorenzo
won the world title in 2010,

27:02.306 --> 27:04.808
Yamaha offered to keep Rossi on

27:04.933 --> 27:09.437
if he'd take a pay cut and accept
number two status in the team.

27:09.562 --> 27:13.399
After a decade, as one of the highest
paid sportsmen in the world,

27:13.524 --> 27:18.028
he might not have needed the money,
but Rossi had always been number one.

27:18.153 --> 27:22.198
Casey Stoner had taken the best bike
available for 2011.

27:22.323 --> 27:24.992
He was leaving Ducati
for Repsol Honda,

27:25.117 --> 27:28.495
the team of his childhood hero,
Mick Doohan.

27:28.620 --> 27:31.706
Rossi now did
what everybody hoped he would.

27:31.831 --> 27:36.710
He said goodbye to his beloved Yamaha
and he moved to Ducati.

27:36.835 --> 27:39.420
The Italian dream team was born.

27:39.545 --> 27:42.881
I remember writing if he wins a race,

27:43.006 --> 27:46.134
it would be like the Pope
winning at Monza in a Ferrari.

27:46.259 --> 27:51.055
And it would be a fantastic story.
But it was an unmitigated disaster.

27:52.014 --> 27:56.018
NARRATOR: Casey Stoner had won
23 races for the Italian team.

27:56.143 --> 27:58.854
None of the other Ducati riders
could come close.

27:59.437 --> 28:01.939
In 2009, when I first got on the bike,

28:02.064 --> 28:05.192
I couldn't believe
how Casey could go so fast with it.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.527
Casey had extreme talent.

28:07.652 --> 28:10.946
NARRATOR: Stoner's success rate at
Ducati had declined over time, though.

28:11.071 --> 28:16.743
Ten wins the first year, then six,
then four, then three.

28:17.285 --> 28:21.372
He had also missed three races
through illness in 2009.

28:21.497 --> 28:25.667
Many thought the declining results
were due to his health problems.

28:25.792 --> 28:27.543
They were wrong.

28:27.668 --> 28:30.754
Stoner wasn't getting worse
as the years went by.

28:31.755 --> 28:33.047
The bike was.

28:34.631 --> 28:38.593
ROSSI: I had a very bad feeling.
From the first time in Valencia.

28:38.718 --> 28:41.554
And I was very, very...

28:41.679 --> 28:46.016
Not desperate, but very worried
to make the wrong choice.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.893
STONER: We copped a lot of flak
from Valentino.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.394
Not just me but my whole team.

28:50.519 --> 28:53.104
Valentino and Jerry Burgess
and all that.

28:53.229 --> 28:55.940
They'd said so many bad things
about what Ducati had done

28:56.065 --> 28:59.526
and what myself and my crew had done.
It really frustrated me.

28:59.651 --> 29:02.195
NARRATOR: Rossi was hampered
by a shoulder injury

29:02.320 --> 29:05.323
from a crash on a dirt bike
in early 2010.

29:05.448 --> 29:09.493
At first he was in bad shape
with his shoulder

29:09.618 --> 29:13.580
but then we realized
the bike was in bad shape as well.

29:13.705 --> 29:18.626
NARRATOR: Rossi was 15th fastest
at the MotoGP test in Valencia.

29:18.751 --> 29:21.378
Stoner was fastest on the Honda.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.673
After the test,
Rossi went back to Italy

29:25.798 --> 29:28.175
for surgery to repair his shoulder.

29:32.262 --> 29:34.847
Four months later,
it was time to go racing.

29:35.973 --> 29:39.601
Stoner won the first grand prix
of 2011 in Qatar.

29:39.726 --> 29:41.811
Rossi was seventh.

29:41.936 --> 29:46.190
The rain in Spain at the second race
was good news for the Italian team.

29:46.315 --> 29:48.233
The wet conditions lowered speeds

29:48.358 --> 29:51.986
and reduced the forces
which unsettled the Ducati in the dry.

29:52.778 --> 29:57.282
Rossi set the fastest lap in the race
and looked on course for a win.

29:57.407 --> 30:00.201
He just needed to get past
Stoner and Simoncelli.

30:01.619 --> 30:06.165
COMMENTATOR: And now Valentino Rossi
has got Casey Stoner in his sight.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.209
He's taken down Stoner!

30:09.334 --> 30:11.794
Valentino Rossi attacked
from a long way back

30:12.020 --> 30:14.355
and he's taken out Casey Stoner.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.943
Rossi's got back on the track.
Stoner's still having problems.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.826
Hey, how's the shoulder? It's OK?

30:28.951 --> 30:30.035
ROSSI: I'm very sorry.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.245
You having some problem
with your shoulder?

30:32.370 --> 30:36.290
Obviously your ambition
outweighed your talent.

30:36.415 --> 30:37.999
ROSSI: I'm very sorry.

30:38.124 --> 30:39.208
No problem.

30:41.543 --> 30:43.586
I had the helmet,
I didn't hear very well.

30:43.711 --> 30:46.672
MAN: What was it?
Your ambition outweighed your talent!

30:46.797 --> 30:48.006
Oh, my golly!

30:48.131 --> 30:53.386
What a thing for Casey Stoner
to say to the nine-time world champion.

30:53.511 --> 30:57.848
I want to say that I don't want
to hear what he said. It was better.

30:57.973 --> 31:00.684
STONER: At that time,
I don't think there was truer words.

31:00.809 --> 31:03.812
A big part of why I said it
was I have no respect for someone

31:03.937 --> 31:06.689
who comes into a garage
with their helmet on to apologize.

31:06.814 --> 31:08.982
You don't do that.
It's not the way it's done.

31:09.107 --> 31:12.235
So, yeah, it frustrated me a little bit
and, erm, you know,

31:12.360 --> 31:15.988
I kind of won't deny
that I enjoyed those two years.

31:17.990 --> 31:21.410
Watching him struggle a heck of
a lot more than we did on the Ducati.

31:27.082 --> 31:28.458
Bad, bad.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.709
It just got worse.

31:29.834 --> 31:32.837
The longer he was there,
the worse the bike became.

31:32.962 --> 31:35.339
They went forwards
and then they went backwards,

31:35.464 --> 31:37.257
they never got there.

31:43.763 --> 31:45.389
He never said anything bad about it

31:45.514 --> 31:48.266
although he must have
wanted to inside.

31:48.391 --> 31:50.684
He kept quiet. (CHUCKLES)

31:50.809 --> 31:52.977
We have a lot of work to do.

31:53.102 --> 31:55.312
I lose too much in entry.
I have too much slide.

31:55.437 --> 31:58.815
We try a lot of different things
with the setting, but we don't fix.

31:58.940 --> 32:01.692
We're struggling.
We need more experience on this bike.

32:01.817 --> 32:04.736
I am very slow. Very negative.
We are not strong enough.

32:04.861 --> 32:09.907
His face was no longer that smiling,
calm face.

32:10.032 --> 32:11.783
I didn't know what to say
and nor did he.

32:13.451 --> 32:15.244
We are very, very sad.

32:18.789 --> 32:21.917
I lost the front,
but seriously, I don't understand why.

32:22.042 --> 32:26.838
Something wasn't right in the team.

32:26.963 --> 32:28.923
We work together with Ducati.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.341
We try,
but at this moment we don't fix a lot.

32:31.466 --> 32:38.556
It can be just a centimeter here
or there that makes the difference.

32:38.681 --> 32:40.641
These are the secrets
which only they know.

32:42.517 --> 32:45.520
The first year he crashed a lot
which meant he was trying.

32:45.645 --> 32:47.938
It's not like he wasn't trying,
he was giving it everything.

32:55.946 --> 32:59.407
NARRATOR: Rossi wasn't the only one
crashing too much in 2011.

32:59.532 --> 33:02.618
Marco Simoncelli
was chasing his first podium.

33:02.743 --> 33:06.204
COMMENTATOR: Marco Simoncelli is never
gonna have a better opportunity

33:06.370 --> 33:09.956
to win a grand prix MotoGP race.

33:10.081 --> 33:13.417
Oh! Simoncelli's going down!

33:13.542 --> 33:16.795
COMMENTATOR 2:
Someone else gone, it is Simoncelli!

33:21.174 --> 33:23.467
COMMENTATOR:
Oh, Simoncelli's gone down!

33:23.592 --> 33:27.137
Marco Simoncelli, he's in line
for a first MotoGP podium

33:27.262 --> 33:30.098
and crashes out at turn one.

33:30.973 --> 33:34.434
STONER: There was no secret
that a few of us riders

33:34.559 --> 33:37.228
were a little bit concerned
about his riding.

33:37.353 --> 33:41.523
COMMENTATOR: Simoncelli's gone down!
And he's taken with him Jorge Lorenzo.

33:41.648 --> 33:45.234
I think the problem is that he's not
very conscious about the risks.

33:45.359 --> 33:51.156
Many, many, many riders want
to make him a little calm in that time.

33:51.281 --> 33:54.701
I was technical director at the time,
looking into race direction

33:54.826 --> 33:58.955
and it's very, very similar
to early Lorenzo career

33:59.080 --> 34:04.085
with talented, really, really, hungry
and full of confidence

34:04.210 --> 34:06.587
and wanting to ride aggressively.

34:06.712 --> 34:09.464
For him the race
is to be aggressive.

34:09.589 --> 34:13.967
If you want to win,
the talents are all aggressive.

34:14.092 --> 34:17.638
Valentino, when he started,
was a talent. He was aggressive.

34:17.763 --> 34:19.389
Everybody's aggressive.

34:23.726 --> 34:27.603
NARRATOR: Dani Pedrosa was building his
strongest challenge for the title yet.

34:27.728 --> 34:31.107
He took second in Spain
and won in Portugal.

34:31.232 --> 34:33.275
Going into the fourth race in France,

34:33.400 --> 34:36.820
he was just behind Lorenzo and ahead
of Stoner in the championship.

34:36.945 --> 34:41.074
He now found himself fighting
for second place with Marco Simoncelli.

34:42.449 --> 34:47.705
ROSSI: Saturday night, before the race
in Le Mans was a weekend

34:47.830 --> 34:52.167
that had a lot of polemic on Marco
because he's too aggressive.

34:52.292 --> 34:56.670
But I say to Marco, "Please, tomorrow,
keep attention to all the other guys,

34:56.795 --> 35:00.800
because for sure all the people
want to look for your mistake."

35:00.925 --> 35:04.595
And he said, "Ah, yeah, yeah,
good idea. I understand."

35:04.720 --> 35:06.471
But unfortunately the next day...

35:06.596 --> 35:10.182
COMMENTATOR: Oh! Pedrosa's gone down!
Did he catch the back wheel there?

35:13.143 --> 35:14.811
He holds his right collarbone.

35:16.187 --> 35:20.274
Marco Simoncelli has been given
a ride-through penalty

35:20.399 --> 35:22.984
for that move on Dani Pedrosa.

35:23.109 --> 35:28.072
And Marco Simoncelli,
that first ever podium finish in MotoGP

35:28.197 --> 35:30.782
has been wrenched from his hand.

35:30.907 --> 35:33.284
PEDROSA: What happened is
I broke my collarbone there.

35:33.409 --> 35:37.413
I had to do two surgeries.
I lost the championship.

35:37.538 --> 35:40.791
I was out for three races.

35:40.916 --> 35:42.918
NARRATOR:
It was a harsh blow for Pedrosa.

35:43.043 --> 35:47.547
He'd only just recovered from breaking
his other collar bone in 2010.

35:47.672 --> 35:53.260
I'm so sorry for his crash
and for his injuries.

35:53.385 --> 35:59.182
But for me,
I haven't done nothing incorrect.

35:59.307 --> 36:01.225
Had he never done
anything wrong before,

36:01.350 --> 36:04.144
he probably
wouldn't have copped that penalty.

36:04.269 --> 36:08.523
It did make him think, his riding
was significantly better after that.

36:12.360 --> 36:15.363
When he did the mistake
with Pedrosa especially,

36:15.488 --> 36:19.492
he suffered very much
because people go to him and say,

36:19.617 --> 36:22.202
"You are a dickhead!"

36:22.327 --> 36:25.747
Because Pedrosa crash
and also have pain another time.

36:25.872 --> 36:28.583
And Pedrosa was very angry with Marco.

36:28.708 --> 36:32.503
And all the people in Spain
was very angry with Marco.

36:32.628 --> 36:35.297
Before the race in Barcelona,

36:35.422 --> 36:41.302
arrive a letter with no signature
with a gun.

36:42.219 --> 36:46.932
Someone from Spain give him
a letter or a mail

36:47.057 --> 36:49.434
with "I wanna kill you."

36:55.022 --> 36:58.275
COMMENTATOR: You can hear boos
as he laps the track by himself.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.026
Dani Pedrosa, not here.

37:00.151 --> 37:03.320
He'll have an operation
on that broken right collarbone.

37:03.486 --> 37:07.490
And I remember that in Barcelona
we have a lot of bodyguards.

37:07.615 --> 37:13.162
Two bodyguards for the weekend.
That makes everyone nervous, no?

37:13.287 --> 37:16.290
He make pole position in practice.

37:16.415 --> 37:18.083
COMMENTATOR: It will be one more lap

37:18.208 --> 37:21.294
for the former 250cc
world champion Simoncelli.

37:21.419 --> 37:22.753
He's protecting that.

37:22.878 --> 37:27.090
COMMENTATOR: He's got pole! Marco
Simoncelli pulled it out of nowhere.

37:27.215 --> 37:31.093
A 142.413! He's been second
in the last two rounds.

37:31.218 --> 37:33.970
And he's pulled that
out of absolutely nowhere.

37:34.095 --> 37:38.432
Marco Simoncelli, the rider who's been
at the center of all the talk,

37:38.557 --> 37:40.308
all the debate, all the discussion

37:40.433 --> 37:44.186
for the last couple of weeks
has now taken pole.

37:44.311 --> 37:46.813
I wonder what kind of reception
he's gonna get

37:46.938 --> 37:49.482
as he wheelies his way
around this circuit.

37:49.607 --> 37:54.236
Simoncelli, despite all the boos
is giving them the wave.

37:54.361 --> 37:56.446
Thank you.
I've got pole. Thank you.

38:05.955 --> 38:10.334
NARRATOR: Marco Simoncelli took
a careful sixth place in Catalunya.

38:10.459 --> 38:14.087
Casey Stoner won.
Jorge Lorenzo was second.

38:14.212 --> 38:17.590
His lead in the championship
shrinking to seven points.

38:19.842 --> 38:24.096
STONER: Marco got a little bit too much
of an attack from people.

38:25.347 --> 38:26.431
So he really backed off.

38:26.556 --> 38:30.601
You saw his results suffering
because it was really affecting him.

38:33.687 --> 38:37.232
NARRATOR: Three races later,
Dani Pedrosa was back.

38:37.357 --> 38:42.695
PEDROSA: When I came back,
I didn't try to have a talk with him.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.905
I kind of avoided.

38:47.198 --> 38:51.410
I regret that. Because life
is too short to have enemies.

38:53.036 --> 38:58.499
NARRATOR: Simoncelli crashed out of
four of the first ten races that year.

38:58.624 --> 39:01.043
But then... things changed.

39:01.793 --> 39:06.839
LORENZO: My impression was that Marco
had changed during the last races.

39:06.964 --> 39:08.799
He was more conscious of the risk

39:08.924 --> 39:13.595
and he was trying
to be a more conscious rider.

39:15.388 --> 39:18.933
STONER: When he started to come back
and his results started to get better,

39:19.058 --> 39:22.102
all of a sudden,
he's racing like a true racer.

39:23.978 --> 39:25.729
COMMENTATOR:
Marco Simoncelli has done it.

39:25.854 --> 39:29.023
Marco Simoncelli has grabbed
his first MotoGP podium.

39:29.148 --> 39:33.318
It's well deserved after everything
he's been through this season.

39:34.777 --> 39:37.738
SIMONCELLI: It feels unbelievable.

39:37.863 --> 39:44.202
I'm really, really happy
and I want to say thanks to everybody

39:44.327 --> 39:46.829
who never stopped believing in me
when I was in a difficult moment.

39:46.954 --> 39:52.209
And everybody who helped me
to arrive here today.

40:01.051 --> 40:04.095
NARRATOR: With three races to go,
Lorenzo was the only rider

40:04.220 --> 40:07.306
with any hope of beating Stoner
in the championship.

40:08.741 --> 40:10.409
There were 65 points between them.

40:10.534 --> 40:13.411
The odds were stacked
against the Spaniard.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.163
But you never know,
Stoner might make a mistake.

40:17.998 --> 40:19.541
He didn't.

40:19.666 --> 40:22.043
COMMENTATOR: Oh! Lorenzo goes down.

40:22.168 --> 40:25.921
NARRATOR: When he went down,
the fingers of Lorenzo's left hand

40:26.046 --> 40:28.965
were trapped between the clutch lever
and the handle bar.

40:29.966 --> 40:33.052
The lever amputated the tip
of his ring finger.

40:33.177 --> 40:35.971
It was a horrible morning for Lorenzo.

40:36.096 --> 40:39.891
But a great afternoon for Casey Stoner.

40:44.145 --> 40:47.148
COMMENTATOR: Casey Stoner
now is closing up

40:47.273 --> 40:51.318
on the 2011 MotoGP world championship.

40:51.443 --> 40:55.196
Simoncelli in second place.
Everybody stands in Phillip Island.

40:55.321 --> 40:59.575
Casey Stoner
wins the Australian Grand Prix.

41:06.707 --> 41:09.835
The 2011 world champion!

41:10.877 --> 41:14.255
STONER: I won the home grand prix.
I think it was our fifth in a row there.

41:14.380 --> 41:17.216
Won the second world championship
on my birthday.

41:17.341 --> 41:18.842
That's a pretty special day.

41:21.302 --> 41:25.014
NARRATOR: Marco Simoncelli was back
on the podium at Phillip Island,

41:25.139 --> 41:27.850
second place his best result yet.

41:27.975 --> 41:33.397
Casey did a great season this year
and he won the title

41:33.522 --> 41:37.901
because this year
he has been number one,

41:38.026 --> 41:42.488
the strongest rider in the track
in every condition and in every race.

41:42.613 --> 41:48.744
My congratulation and also I want to say
good luck to Lorenzo for his injury.

41:48.869 --> 41:52.706
NARRATOR: Stoner might have locked up
the title, but the fight was still on.

41:52.831 --> 41:56.709
For a racer, all that ever matters
is the next race.

41:56.834 --> 41:58.585
There were two to go.

41:58.710 --> 42:03.715
I hope to continue to work in
the right way and finish on the podium.

42:03.840 --> 42:09.971
Maybe I hope, also, to stay
on the first step of the podium.

42:13.849 --> 42:16.726
NARRATOR: The next race was
at Marco Simoncelli's track.

42:17.852 --> 42:21.939
His nickname, Sic,
is also the acronym of the circuit

42:22.064 --> 42:24.983
which had seen the biggest moments
of his career to date.

42:26.401 --> 42:28.277
SIC Circuit.

42:28.402 --> 42:30.278
I remember the first time
we went there

42:30.403 --> 42:31.946
we found all these SIC T-shirts.

42:32.071 --> 42:34.156
His mum and I bought loads of them.

42:34.281 --> 42:38.159
Because they were
just the thing for us.

42:38.284 --> 42:41.287
It stood
for Sepang International Circuit

42:41.412 --> 42:45.290
but it was
one of those strange coincidences.

42:47.125 --> 42:48.376
NARRATOR: At the end of lap one,

42:48.501 --> 42:52.213
Simoncelli was fighting Alvaro Bautista
for fourth place.

42:52.338 --> 42:53.714
COMMENTATOR: Bautista through.

42:53.839 --> 42:57.884
Simoncelli did well just to bring that
back on the inside of Alvaro Bautista.

42:58.009 --> 43:01.387
Stoner leads by a second on that first
lap, but it's not done and dusted.

43:01.512 --> 43:06.058
This is just what we would have wanted
as Bautista was through on Simoncelli.

43:06.183 --> 43:09.561
Down the straight there is one place
Simoncelli struggles on the track.

43:09.686 --> 43:12.188
Oh, as Bautista
then round the outside...

43:12.980 --> 43:16.858
NARRATOR: Colin Edwards and Valentino
Rossi were just behind Simoncelli.

44:00.693 --> 44:05.114
I touch him but I was behind Colin.
I see him just at the last moment.

44:10.452 --> 44:14.038
I saw him crash. I was looking up
in the corner and he's crashed.

44:14.163 --> 44:19.042
I'm gonna duck under and get
a good drive to the next corner.

44:19.167 --> 44:21.669
The next thing you know,
he was right in front of us.

44:21.794 --> 44:25.631
He lost the front.
He was just fighting to get it back.

44:25.756 --> 44:30.844
He's a fighter
and he wasn't willing to give it up.

44:30.969 --> 44:35.974
When I saw Marco crash, I think Marco
go on the outside like normal.

44:36.099 --> 44:38.810
Never coming to the inside.

44:38.935 --> 44:43.272
We saw it happen and we looked away
and we're in the opposite direction

44:43.397 --> 44:45.148
from where that crash is happening.

44:45.273 --> 44:48.317
And it just came back to us.
There was nothing we could do.

44:56.325 --> 45:02.164
We can confirm
Marco Simoncelli died today at 4:56pm.

45:08.044 --> 45:10.421
PEDROSA: I went to his father.

45:10.546 --> 45:12.965
And...

45:13.090 --> 45:18.386
Just look at the eyes,
that's all you can say.

45:21.013 --> 45:22.472
(APPLAUSE)

45:35.276 --> 45:36.819
(CHOIR SINGS)

46:01.468 --> 46:04.971
All the important things Marco did,
he did in Malaysia.

46:06.180 --> 46:10.726
The worst crash, the only time
he hurt himself was in Malaysia.

46:10.851 --> 46:14.271
On the 125, in 2003 or 2004.

46:14.396 --> 46:19.234
Then he won the world championship
in Malaysia.

46:20.485 --> 46:25.865
He set the fastest lap
in the MotoGP test in Malaysia.

46:27.199 --> 46:28.241
Everything.

46:28.366 --> 46:32.078
And then he chose to die in Malaysia.

46:32.203 --> 46:35.372
It's a strange thing. Very strange.

46:56.351 --> 47:00.188
I didn't want silence.
Silence creates anguish.

47:00.313 --> 47:02.606
Marco would have wanted noise.

47:02.731 --> 47:05.567
He was a noisy guy.

47:14.534 --> 47:16.536
(APPLAUSE)

47:20.665 --> 47:22.708
(FIREWORKS)

47:52.946 --> 47:54.864
NARRATOR: The race never ends.

47:56.198 --> 48:01.536
The new season began in April 2012
in the darkness of the Qatari desert.

48:03.746 --> 48:05.038
They were all there.

48:06.956 --> 48:08.290
All but one.

48:15.130 --> 48:16.965
MAN: Did you think about stopping?

48:17.090 --> 48:18.758
ROSSI: No, never.

48:18.883 --> 48:23.762
It's not a problem of MotoGP.

48:23.887 --> 48:29.183
It was a bad thing
because I lose a friend, you know?

48:29.308 --> 48:36.106
But I never make the link
that this can stop my career.

48:36.231 --> 48:39.150
I will stop when I don't like any more

48:39.275 --> 48:43.904
to race with motorcycles
but not for that reason.

48:46.865 --> 48:51.744
DRUDI: Everyone in this world
knows what can happen.

48:51.869 --> 48:54.454
They are not crazy people.

48:54.579 --> 48:58.374
That is a fight
between those guys and...

48:58.499 --> 49:00.125
- (QUESTIONS IN ITALIAN)
- MAN: Death.

49:01.126 --> 49:04.254
In the mind of a rider,
that is the biggest challenge.

49:04.379 --> 49:09.759
They are afraid as any other person,
but they decide to have that fight.

49:09.884 --> 49:12.636
That fight gives a really strong energy

49:12.761 --> 49:16.723
to feel the life,
the blood rolling around your body.

49:16.848 --> 49:20.393
SUPPO: Since the Roman Empire there was
in the Coliseum the gladiators.

49:20.518 --> 49:22.269
These are a kind of gladiator.

49:22.394 --> 49:27.107
If you ask yourself does it make sense?
No.

49:27.232 --> 49:31.736
We are crazy to risk the life
of young people for what?

49:31.861 --> 49:36.866
But it's also true
this is part of human culture.

49:36.991 --> 49:40.786
It's been like this since the beginning
and probably will be like this forever.

49:40.911 --> 49:45.749
This reminds us
to respect the things we do.

49:45.874 --> 49:49.335
And... sometimes you get criticized.

49:49.460 --> 49:54.047
This guy... From the sofa,
it's very easy to point the finger.

49:54.172 --> 49:57.967
But then you see these things
and everybody's like,

49:58.092 --> 50:01.428
"Oh, what happened? What happened?"
But it's already too late.

50:01.553 --> 50:07.058
So we are not just some guys
that live the dream.

50:07.183 --> 50:08.767
We are also humans.

50:08.892 --> 50:13.187
GRESINI: This is part of the game.
The game of life.

50:13.312 --> 50:15.772
We're here today,
tomorrow we don't know.

50:15.897 --> 50:20.735
Sometimes in the evening
when the light is fading

50:20.860 --> 50:23.070
you go to bed
and thoughts come back to you.

50:23.195 --> 50:29.659
You re-live certain moments
and it's very sad, very moving.

50:29.784 --> 50:34.997
But the next day,
the light returns, life goes on.

50:35.872 --> 50:38.791
NARRATOR: Valentino Rossi
was serving out his time,

50:38.916 --> 50:41.543
the second year of his Ducati contract.

50:41.668 --> 50:45.421
It was hard to see him like that
with out a victory in two years.

50:45.546 --> 50:49.049
To see him like that,
his eyes no longer shining.

50:49.174 --> 50:52.635
To see him unhappy.
It was awful.

51:01.644 --> 51:03.270
GAMBINI: Valentino is Valentino.

51:03.395 --> 51:05.897
If they don't give him the perfect bike
the way he wants it,

51:06.022 --> 51:07.273
he can't risk it.

51:07.398 --> 51:11.693
He can't risk his life.
It wasn't safe.

51:17.907 --> 51:22.870
NARRATOR: Casey Stoner
had a plan for 2012, do it again.

51:22.995 --> 51:25.247
Win the world championship
and underline the fact

51:25.372 --> 51:28.041
that he was
the number one rider in the world.

51:28.166 --> 51:30.418
COMMENTATOR: The chequered flag
beckons the Australian.

51:30.543 --> 51:32.586
It will be his second successive win.

51:32.711 --> 51:38.758
He leads the world championship
by one point after three rounds.

51:38.883 --> 51:40.926
NARRATOR:
At the fourth race in France,

51:41.051 --> 51:44.971
the Australian announced the other part
of his plan for the year.

51:45.096 --> 51:47.306
MAN: Casey now is gonna make
an announcement.

51:47.431 --> 51:50.100
You know this has been coming
for a couple of years now.

51:50.225 --> 51:52.477
At the end of this 2012 season,

51:52.602 --> 51:57.440
I will be... not racing
in the 2013 championship.

51:57.565 --> 52:00.859
I will be finishing my career
at the end of this season in MotoGP.

52:00.984 --> 52:04.570
And go forward
with different things in my life.

52:04.695 --> 52:06.071
NARRATOR: How could he do it?

52:06.196 --> 52:08.615
Walk away from it all,
at the age of just 27,

52:08.740 --> 52:12.410
when he's got the best bike,
he's the reigning world champion

52:12.535 --> 52:14.328
and he's making millions?

52:14.453 --> 52:16.496
There were all kinds of theories.

52:16.621 --> 52:18.581
The birth of his daughter Alessandra,

52:18.706 --> 52:22.334
ironically
on Valentino Rossi's birthday.

52:22.459 --> 52:25.462
The possible effect
of Marco Simoncelli's death.

52:25.587 --> 52:30.675
Stoner's loathing of the media
and the MotoGP circus in general.

52:30.800 --> 52:33.844
I'm sure he would like
to live in the Eighties.

52:34.070 --> 52:36.947
Much less media people
came to the racing.

52:37.072 --> 52:40.700
Riders, they don't need
to care about any kind of image.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.910
They could say whatever they want.

52:43.035 --> 52:45.912
Now you have to be
very politically correct.

52:46.037 --> 52:48.956
And you spend long hours
speaking to the press,

52:49.081 --> 52:50.999
doing events for your sponsors.

52:51.124 --> 52:53.417
STONER:
All I ever wanted to do was go racing.

52:53.542 --> 52:59.422
And unfortunately 90 to 95% of this job
became media appearances.

52:59.547 --> 53:01.882
Everything else but racing.

53:02.007 --> 53:09.097
MAN: That's the game now. Every big
sport has a lot of communication

53:09.222 --> 53:10.890
and PR activity behind it.

53:11.015 --> 53:13.726
He was just burned out.
It ate away at him inside.

53:13.851 --> 53:17.437
PR appearances, interviews
and he took it all so personally.

53:17.562 --> 53:21.065
And I said to him,
"Case, just treat it as a job."

53:22.066 --> 53:26.111
STONER: I know it's a job.
At the same time you're going out there,

53:26.236 --> 53:28.488
risking every day,
you gotta have passion in it.

53:28.613 --> 53:31.073
When you lose that,
it's hard to find the motivation

53:31.198 --> 53:34.034
to keep going out there
and doing the same things.

53:34.159 --> 53:38.830
NARRATOR: He might be retiring,
but Stoner was not backing off.

53:38.955 --> 53:41.916
STONER: I wanted to go out
wearing the number one plate.

53:42.041 --> 53:44.376
We made a mistake in Sachsenring.

53:44.501 --> 53:47.712
And quite honestly, I was confident
I would still win the championship.

53:47.837 --> 53:51.048
NARRATOR: A month later,
Stoner made a second mistake.

53:57.345 --> 53:59.680
STONER: I just made that mistake
in Indianapolis

53:59.805 --> 54:02.724
and destroyed my ankle and that was it.

54:02.849 --> 54:06.185
NARRATOR: The impact tore
every ligament in his foot.

54:06.310 --> 54:08.603
He was out for three races.

54:10.187 --> 54:12.147
It was Dani Pedrosa's moment.

54:13.356 --> 54:17.568
He took victory in Germany,
Indianapolis and the Czech Republic.

54:17.693 --> 54:23.115
With six races to go, he was just
13 points behind Jorge Lorenzo.

54:24.074 --> 54:26.659
Pedrosa qualified on pole
for the next race.

54:26.784 --> 54:28.368
The San Marino Grand Prix.

54:29.494 --> 54:33.164
COMMENTATOR:
Ready for battle. Dani Pedrosa.

54:33.289 --> 54:36.500
His fourth pole position
of the season.

54:36.625 --> 54:41.755
Round 13.
The MotoGP world championship.

54:41.880 --> 54:43.965
Thirteen points

54:44.090 --> 54:49.720
between number 26 and number 99.

54:49.845 --> 54:53.807
What's this? The bike's being
taken away for Dani Pedrosa.

54:53.932 --> 54:59.103
Is there some kind of problem
for Pedrosa who is in pole?

54:59.228 --> 55:00.938
What is going on?

55:08.236 --> 55:11.239
There is a problem
with Dani Pedrosa's machine.

55:11.364 --> 55:16.869
This would not be fair.
This really just would not be fair.

55:16.994 --> 55:20.038
He does not deserve this
after the season he's put together.

55:20.163 --> 55:23.207
He's behind the safety car, isn't he?

55:23.332 --> 55:25.625
Please, no problem for Dani Pedrosa

55:25.750 --> 55:30.171
because we want to see him and Lorenzo
fight it out for the title.

55:30.296 --> 55:32.131
Will Dani Pedrosa get there?
Here he comes.

55:32.256 --> 55:34.800
He's gonna thread his way through.
No, he's not!

55:34.925 --> 55:36.968
He's starting
from the back of the grid.

55:37.093 --> 55:40.304
You cannot believe the misfortune.

55:43.265 --> 55:46.142
It's Lorenzo leading, Rossi in second,
Bradl in third.

55:46.267 --> 55:49.895
Dani Pedrosa has everything to do
on these first couple of laps.

55:50.020 --> 55:52.355
COMMENTATOR 2: There was some problem
with the front brake.

55:52.480 --> 55:54.732
They managed to get it cleared.
It was too late for Pedrosa

55:54.857 --> 55:58.402
to catch the safety car, that's why
he had to start from back of the grid.

55:58.527 --> 56:01.029
COMMENTATOR:
Lorenzo's cleared off at the front.

56:01.154 --> 56:03.030
They come towards La Quercia.

56:03.864 --> 56:09.661
27 laps in this race.
And that's Pedrosa being taken down!

56:09.786 --> 56:12.663
He's been taken down by Hector Barbera.

56:12.788 --> 56:16.958
And that could be
the championship right there.

56:17.083 --> 56:21.170
I cannot believe he can't get through
a season without something...

56:21.295 --> 56:23.422
Ah, it's just awful.

56:32.639 --> 56:35.475
NARRATOR: Casey Stoner was back
in time for his home race.

56:36.684 --> 56:39.520
STONER: They warned me
when I came back prematurely,

56:39.645 --> 56:41.438
"If you crash
and hurt your foot again,

56:41.563 --> 56:44.065
you're probably never gonna walk
normally again."

56:47.109 --> 56:51.196
NARRATOR: He took the 45th
and final victory of his MotoGP career.

56:53.823 --> 56:55.866
But it was Jorge Lorenzo's day.

56:55.991 --> 56:59.869
His second MotoGP world title
in three years.

57:21.515 --> 57:24.976
COMMENTATOR: We're gonna watch
Lorenzo come across the line and win!

57:42.201 --> 57:44.703
NARRATOR: Two weeks after
his victory in Australia,

57:45.203 --> 57:51.209
Casey Stoner rode his final MotoGP race
at Valencia, taking third place.

57:51.334 --> 57:53.878
COMMENTATOR: Thank you, Casey Stoner
for what you've given us.

57:54.003 --> 57:57.381
It's the end of an amazing career.

57:58.757 --> 58:01.676
An amazing rider as well in MotoGP.

58:03.260 --> 58:06.179
NARRATOR: This left a Honda
race machine looking for a rider.

58:08.639 --> 58:13.310
The Honda Racing Corporation had known
for a while who that rider would be.

58:13.768 --> 58:17.396
Several years ago, I thought

58:17.521 --> 58:21.274
maybe he's able
to ride a MotoGP machine.

58:22.817 --> 58:27.488
NARRATOR: In 2010, Marc Marquez
was racing in the junior class

58:27.613 --> 58:29.239
and fighting for the title.

58:29.364 --> 58:32.867
COMMENTATOR: No sign of any nerves from
anybody on the team or Marc Marquez.

58:32.992 --> 58:35.786
He is one mature 17-year-old rider

58:35.911 --> 58:38.622
and I'm sure he already has
a game plan for this race.

58:38.747 --> 58:42.625
COMMENTATOR 2: Instead of winning,
he should be going to school.

58:42.750 --> 58:45.544
MARQUEZ: On the warm-up lap,
the track was completely dry.

58:45.669 --> 58:47.962
Only the last corner
was a little bit wet.

58:48.087 --> 58:52.132
When I arrived there, I feel normal.
I didn't see the water.

58:52.257 --> 58:55.218
COMMENTATOR:
See Marquez is going fairly quick.

58:55.343 --> 58:58.054
He's pushing to see how much grip
there is... And he's gone!

58:58.179 --> 59:00.264
This could be massive
for the championship.

59:00.389 --> 59:02.641
That's huge.
And he's broken the front fairing.

59:02.766 --> 59:04.392
Can he get the bike back out there?

59:04.517 --> 59:08.270
This could be where the championship
gets decided.

59:08.395 --> 59:13.358
A stupid crash.
You lose all the work in one year.

59:14.484 --> 59:17.320
COMMENTATOR: He's going in, pointing.
He's going back into pit lane.

59:17.445 --> 59:20.656
He had a chance of the championship
and he'd just thrown it away.

59:20.781 --> 59:23.700
MARQUEZ: There was some panic there,
me and also the team.

59:23.825 --> 59:27.495
COMMENTATOR: He needs the handlebars
working on. There's JuliÃ , his father.

59:27.620 --> 59:30.664
They're saying he's got to go out.
Telling him to get back out there.

59:30.789 --> 59:33.374
Panic stations at the Ajo Derbi team.

59:33.499 --> 59:38.420
MOODY: The people that flocked
to that motorcycle to help him

59:38.545 --> 59:42.423
get a chance of doing the grand prix,

59:42.548 --> 59:44.383
they saw that he was something special.

59:44.508 --> 59:49.387
MARQUEZ: In nine minutes,
they repaired the bike.

59:49.512 --> 59:53.098
COMMENTATOR: Marquez, he will start
from the back of the grid.

59:53.223 --> 59:55.433
Nine laps of the Estoril circuit,

59:55.558 --> 59:58.352
could it determine
the outcome of the championship?

59:58.477 --> 01:00:01.646
Marquez has made a cracking start
from the back of the grid.

01:00:01.771 --> 01:00:04.064
Already around the outside,
he goes through.

01:00:04.189 --> 01:00:07.817
He knows he has to make a good start.
From seventeenth to fourth.

01:00:07.942 --> 01:00:10.986
Marquez is through on Jonas Folger,
now on Pol Espargaro.

01:00:11.111 --> 01:00:13.655
This is where he's gonna make his move.

01:00:15.531 --> 01:00:17.991
One lap to go.

01:00:18.116 --> 01:00:21.869
The most important lap
in the 17-year-old's life.

01:00:21.994 --> 01:00:25.747
There he goes. Up the inside
of Nico Terol, Marquez leads the way.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:27.999
If Marquez wins this
and he's in second place...

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:30.960
Here he comes into turn three.
Nico Terol back into the lead.

01:00:31.085 --> 01:00:33.629
Wide on exit for Terol.
Marquez back in front.

01:00:33.754 --> 01:00:36.214
Marquez is very, very fast
through the Parabolica.

01:00:36.339 --> 01:00:39.550
He's chasing his tenth
grand prix victory of the season.

01:00:39.675 --> 01:00:42.386
This could be the ride
that gets the world title.

01:00:42.511 --> 01:00:45.639
Marc Marquez wins here in Portugal!

01:00:45.764 --> 01:00:50.435
MARQUEZ: I won the title.
We cannot repeat that. It's impossible.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.020
That moment, that situation.

01:00:53.145 --> 01:00:56.356
COMMENTATOR: Anything that could have
happened to Marc Marquez did happen.

01:00:56.481 --> 01:01:02.236
He came back, showed everything today
that's needed to be a world champion.

01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:07.324
MOODY: He'd never won
a grand prix before 2010.

01:01:07.449 --> 01:01:10.535
He won his first grand prix in 2010
midway through the season.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.537
He won a load on the trot
and he won the championship.

01:01:13.662 --> 01:01:19.793
Grown men cried in that garage.
They could not believe it.

01:01:19.918 --> 01:01:24.839
COMMENTATOR: Look at Emilio Alzamora.
He's aged about ten years in nine laps.

01:01:32.638 --> 01:01:36.808
Today belongs to
the 17-year-old Spaniard Marc Marquez.

01:01:36.933 --> 01:01:38.517
Where will this end?

01:01:38.642 --> 01:01:43.938
This is the start
of a very, very exciting career.

01:01:46.231 --> 01:01:51.402
NARRATOR: Marquez moved up to Moto2
in 2011 and went on the attack.

01:01:52.337 --> 01:01:56.132
He did everything all the great riders
before him had done, only more.

01:01:57.341 --> 01:02:00.385
He crashed out
of the first three races,

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:02.637
then won seven of the next ten.

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:06.432
COMMENTATOR: It's going to be Marc
Marquez who wins back to back races.

01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:10.060
NARRATOR: He was leading the Moto2
championship with three races to go.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:15.689
His star was rising faster than Rossi,
Lorenzo and Stoner's before him.

01:02:15.814 --> 01:02:19.859
Only Pedrosa had won the intermediate
class at his first attempt.

01:02:21.318 --> 01:02:24.946
Marquez's determination to push
the limits of his bike and tires,

01:02:25.071 --> 01:02:29.075
to find ways to go even faster,
saw him running at race pace

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.785
every second that he could
in the practice sessions.

01:02:33.036 --> 01:02:35.455
At the end of practice
before the Australian race,

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.374
after the flag had come out
to end the session,

01:02:38.499 --> 01:02:41.001
and when the other riders
were slowing down,

01:02:41.126 --> 01:02:43.753
Marquez was still going flat out.

01:03:05.775 --> 01:03:08.986
He was sent to the back of the grid
in punishment.

01:03:09.111 --> 01:03:10.695
It didn't make much difference.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.822
COMMENTATOR:
Watching Marquez from the back.

01:03:12.947 --> 01:03:15.115
He's flown up the middle of that field.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.618
So it hasn't mattered one bit,
has it really?

01:03:18.743 --> 01:03:23.080
Who will be in third place? It's gonna
be Marc Marquez in third place.

01:03:23.205 --> 01:03:27.000
Starting from the back of the grid.
He's ridden through to third place.

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:32.922
Marquez is a very, very
happy 18-year-old.

01:03:35.299 --> 01:03:38.760
NARRATOR: A week later,
at the penultimate race in Malaysia,

01:03:38.885 --> 01:03:41.679
Marquez crashed hard in practice.

01:03:45.849 --> 01:03:53.189
MIR: The blow to his head damaged
a branch of the optic nerve.

01:03:53.314 --> 01:03:54.898
Mark could see like this,

01:03:55.023 --> 01:03:57.692
it was when he did this
that there was a problem.

01:03:57.817 --> 01:04:03.030
If he can't recover 100%,
he cannot do this sport.

01:04:03.155 --> 01:04:05.615
Because they're always
looking up like this.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:09.118
It's a frightening injury.

01:04:10.244 --> 01:04:12.246
NARRATOR:
Marquez watched with one eye

01:04:12.371 --> 01:04:15.499
as the Moto2 championship
slipped away to Stefan Bradl.

01:04:15.624 --> 01:04:18.251
I was suffering. He's my son.

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:20.878
They say there may be complications.

01:04:21.003 --> 01:04:22.879
NARRATOR: Marquez ended the year

01:04:23.004 --> 01:04:25.381
not knowing
if he would ever race again.

01:04:26.298 --> 01:04:29.926
Marc is very positive, so are
the family and the people around him.

01:04:30.051 --> 01:04:33.429
He was the one that handled it best.

01:04:33.554 --> 01:04:37.307
He must have had his moments
but he never showed it.

01:04:37.432 --> 01:04:39.016
It's the kind of person he is.

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:41.101
"Don't worry, give it time,
it'll get better."

01:04:41.226 --> 01:04:44.354
MIR: It was micro surgery.

01:04:44.479 --> 01:04:49.275
They changed
the angle of the muscle slightly.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.152
Now he sees perfectly.
He's cured.

01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:56.197
COMMENTATOR: Oh, and they're both
running wide. Luthi follows Espergaro.

01:04:56.322 --> 01:04:58.657
Marc Marquez takes over the front.

01:04:58.782 --> 01:05:01.075
Oh! Iannone!

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.869
There was no way through there,
but through he went.

01:05:03.994 --> 01:05:08.081
Marquez comes back at him immediately,
right across the front of him.

01:05:08.206 --> 01:05:10.458
That is aggressive, isn't it?

01:05:11.959 --> 01:05:13.210
Luthi's gone wide!

01:05:13.335 --> 01:05:17.714
They were right next to each other
going into that first corner.

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:21.801
What a comeback by Marc Marquez!

01:05:21.926 --> 01:05:25.429
He wins the opening round
of the Moto2 world championship

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:26.888
here in Qatar.

01:05:27.013 --> 01:05:32.560
After missing those final three
grand prix with that horrible injury.

01:05:35.813 --> 01:05:41.360
Oh, and that was Tom Luthi. He's really
not happy with Marc Marquez there.

01:05:42.861 --> 01:05:48.241
NARRATOR: Marquez went on to win nine
races and the 2012 Moto2 championship.

01:05:48.366 --> 01:05:53.579
His season ended the same way it began,
with both victory and controversy.

01:05:53.704 --> 01:05:56.623
COMMENTATOR: Marc Marquez
may have qualified in second place

01:05:56.748 --> 01:06:00.001
but he will start from the back row
of the grid, the new world champion

01:06:00.126 --> 01:06:07.133
after an incident in practice on Friday
afternoon with him and Simone Corsi.

01:06:08.467 --> 01:06:12.512
WEBB: That was aggressive contact
several times

01:06:12.637 --> 01:06:14.305
with other riders during practice.

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:16.765
It was a recurrence
of a number of things

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.808
that had happened during the year.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:21.560
So that was like
an accumulation of penalties.

01:06:21.685 --> 01:06:25.063
To say, "OK, you cannot ride like this."
So he was sent to the back.

01:06:26.481 --> 01:06:28.065
COMMENTATOR: He's an aggressive rider.

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.150
He's been involved
in controversy all season.

01:06:30.275 --> 01:06:32.235
Speaking to Emilio Alzamora
on the grid,

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.072
there is no remorse there from his team
manager, his mentor, Emilio Alzamora.

01:06:36.197 --> 01:06:39.783
In his opinion, he can't understand
why there was a penalty at all.

01:06:39.908 --> 01:06:41.951
If that's what he thinks,
you can guarantee

01:06:42.076 --> 01:06:44.203
that's what Marc Marquez thinks,
as well.

01:06:44.328 --> 01:06:48.373
COMMENTATOR 2: Marquez has already made
up about ten, eleven positions or so.

01:06:48.498 --> 01:06:52.418
And he's tried to weave through
heading up towards turn two.

01:06:52.543 --> 01:06:56.922
What a first few corners. He's already
up to about 13th position there.

01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:59.090
It's not gonna be easy from here.

01:07:01.467 --> 01:07:05.721
Yeah, this race is far from over,
a long way to go.

01:07:05.846 --> 01:07:09.099
Whoa! Marquez and Aegerter
both touched in there.

01:07:09.224 --> 01:07:12.769
Wow, they've done amazing
to hang on, though. Both of them.

01:07:19.192 --> 01:07:25.489
Here he comes. He's not gonna
be shy about this one, is he? Wow.

01:07:30.076 --> 01:07:33.329
Marc Marquez will win
his ninth race of the season!

01:07:33.454 --> 01:07:36.290
What a ride by the world champion!

01:07:37.249 --> 01:07:40.043
That is one of the performances
of the season

01:07:40.168 --> 01:07:43.713
in any class of grand prix racing.

01:07:43.838 --> 01:07:46.173
That's it! That's his time done
in the lower classes.

01:07:46.298 --> 01:07:49.175
He's with the big boys now.
What an apprenticeship.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:54.388
Welcome to MotoGP, Marc Marquez.
The rest of you, be warned.

01:07:59.434 --> 01:08:04.105
NARRATOR:
2013, Rossi returns to Yamaha.

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:06.232
Can he still do it?

01:08:06.357 --> 01:08:10.194
34 years old.
Two years without a win.

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:13.697
This is his 14th season
in the premiere class.

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:17.450
Most riders are at their peak
for very few years.

01:08:17.575 --> 01:08:21.453
One or two have stayed competitive
for a decade or so.

01:08:21.578 --> 01:08:26.040
But 14 years in the premiere class
and still a winner?

01:08:27.332 --> 01:08:30.292
Nobody. Never.

01:08:34.337 --> 01:08:39.009
Before the season begins,
Honda and Yamaha go testing in Texas.

01:08:39.134 --> 01:08:41.301
BURGESS: The structure
in any good racing team

01:08:41.426 --> 01:08:43.595
is to have young riders
come in to put pressure

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.723
on the older rider
and to extend their career.

01:08:46.848 --> 01:08:50.893
Lorenzo was brought in in 2007
to do exactly what he has done.

01:08:51.018 --> 01:08:55.647
To move in and gain experience
from the old bull

01:08:55.772 --> 01:08:57.064
and then push the old bull out.

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:58.231
That's exactly what he did.

01:08:58.356 --> 01:09:03.109
And off we went to Ducati.
And here we are back again.

01:09:03.234 --> 01:09:06.613
The old bull is not
the threat that he once was.

01:09:06.738 --> 01:09:10.198
Lorenzo is the world champion last year
and 26 years old

01:09:10.323 --> 01:09:13.868
and still enormously talented.
The man's a machine.

01:09:17.747 --> 01:09:22.001
I'm surprised by the desire
he still has to go racing

01:09:22.126 --> 01:09:24.627
and to put himself on the line.

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:30.049
Dinner at night,
the way he talks about racing,

01:09:30.174 --> 01:09:34.428
you can feel
the passion is huge for him.

01:09:36.304 --> 01:09:39.890
Still I feel a little bit strange
when I saw Valentino,

01:09:40.015 --> 01:09:42.725
when I saw Lorenzo,
when I saw Pedrosa...

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:47.689
Especially with Valentino.
But in the end, they are my opponents.

01:09:47.814 --> 01:09:51.024
And we need to be stronger, too.

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:54.945
We cannot say
"OK, these guys are faster than me."

01:10:00.742 --> 01:10:04.245
NARRATOR: Testing
is the endless quest for more speed.

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:08.915
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

01:10:09.999 --> 01:10:16.630
ROSSI: When you ride, you have
an idea to go as fast as possible

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:22.427
and you have to understand the way
to set the bike to make this idea true.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.761
NARRATOR: Everything is adjustable.

01:10:24.886 --> 01:10:28.180
The chassis, the suspension,
the electronics.

01:10:28.305 --> 01:10:31.141
In the end, all riders
are looking for the same adjustment.

01:10:31.266 --> 01:10:35.728
That magic click.
The one that gives you confidence.

01:10:35.853 --> 01:10:39.231
In bikes, the center of gravity
is changing all the time

01:10:39.356 --> 01:10:40.690
depending on the body.

01:10:40.815 --> 01:10:44.485
It's not a fixed center of gravity,
weight distribution...

01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:46.486
Everything changes in one second.

01:10:46.611 --> 01:10:49.280
It's something magic
between what the bike can be

01:10:49.405 --> 01:10:51.407
and what the rider can do.

01:10:52.574 --> 01:10:55.368
NARRATOR: Dani Pedrosa is coming off
his best year ever.

01:10:55.493 --> 01:10:59.121
Seven wins in 2012.
More than anybody else.

01:10:59.246 --> 01:11:03.166
Not bad for a rider
once dismissed as too small at 5'2"

01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:05.209
to handle a MotoGP bike.

01:11:07.085 --> 01:11:10.421
People I don't think realize
that with the body that Dani has

01:11:10.546 --> 01:11:12.589
to ride this bike
is a super difficult job.

01:11:12.714 --> 01:11:14.632
Because these bikes are big and heavy.

01:11:14.858 --> 01:11:17.026
The leverage you can do
moving on the bike

01:11:17.151 --> 01:11:19.695
with short arms and legs
is more difficult.

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.321
When you brake, you cannot move.

01:11:21.446 --> 01:11:24.240
And in the corner
it's more difficult to control the bike.

01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:29.745
PEDROSA: It's not easy being small,
to get the grip I'd like to have.

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:34.541
Less weight, less load on the tire,
less grip.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:39.045
NARRATOR: The circuit of the Americas
is a new track.

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:41.547
It's the first time here for everybody.

01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:45.467
At the end of two days testing,
the Hondas are on top.

01:11:45.592 --> 01:11:48.094
Marquez just ahead of Pedrosa.

01:11:49.053 --> 01:11:52.514
It's time to go racing.
Who's it going to be?

01:11:52.639 --> 01:11:55.600
NAKAMOTO: I believe Dani.
Last year, he won seven races.

01:11:55.725 --> 01:12:00.938
The package of Honda's machine,
Dani's riding, skill, and the team,

01:12:01.063 --> 01:12:04.357
this package is now very, very strong.

01:12:05.775 --> 01:12:11.238
Marc Marquez has a high level of talent,
but he needs more time.

01:12:12.322 --> 01:12:16.409
NARRATOR: Lorenzo was third fastest
in Texas. Rossi was fifth.

01:12:16.534 --> 01:12:22.414
I don't know if Valentino
will be able to win again

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:25.375
this year or the next one.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.336
Because he passed two years
in another world

01:12:28.461 --> 01:12:31.338
and he lose completely
all his information

01:12:31.463 --> 01:12:36.509
from his computer.

01:12:36.634 --> 01:12:40.429
All the information to be fast.

01:12:40.554 --> 01:12:45.141
This year he has to begin again.

01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:50.104
To learn again to go fast.
To learn again to win.

01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:54.441
For Valentino,
it's the possibility to be happy again.

01:12:54.566 --> 01:12:56.276
Yeah, for sure.

01:13:02.824 --> 01:13:07.119
MAN: If it all goes well,
are you ready to ring the bells?

01:13:07.244 --> 01:13:11.373
Don Giuseppe has lubricated the bells.

01:13:11.498 --> 01:13:12.707
Tomorrow we ring them!

01:13:12.832 --> 01:13:14.500
WOMAN: Let's hope so!

01:13:21.465 --> 01:13:23.216
(CHATTER)

01:13:25.176 --> 01:13:27.011
(SHOUTING)

01:14:10.304 --> 01:14:13.098
(CHEERING)

01:14:57.517 --> 01:14:59.560
COMMENTATOR:
Who's going to finish in second place?

01:14:59.685 --> 01:15:02.270
Is it the return of the doctor
in second place? It is!

01:15:02.395 --> 01:15:04.939
Rossi's second!
Marquez is third!

01:15:05.064 --> 01:15:07.107
(CHEERING)

01:15:30.547 --> 01:15:35.260
COMMENTATOR: Marc Marquez, can he go
a step further and win here in Texas?

01:15:39.973 --> 01:15:41.265
It's very exciting.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:42.516
Here comes my son.

01:15:42.641 --> 01:15:45.018
Hey, he's in front,
it's even more exciting.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.402
He spends the whole session
with his fingers crossed.

01:15:55.527 --> 01:15:56.611
The whole session.

01:15:56.736 --> 01:15:58.654
COMMENTATOR:
Over the crest for the first time.

01:15:58.779 --> 01:16:01.656
Try holding your fingers crossed
for longer than five minutes.

01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:03.657
Marc Marquez now into second place.

01:16:03.782 --> 01:16:06.659
He does it for the whole race.
He's scary to watch with.

01:16:06.784 --> 01:16:10.829
Any little movement that Marc will have,
he shrieks or makes a sudden movement.

01:16:10.954 --> 01:16:12.622
It scares me more.
I can't stand next to him.

01:16:12.747 --> 01:16:14.123
MARQUEZ'S FATHER:
You suffer a lot

01:16:14.248 --> 01:16:18.210
but then if everything ends well
you feel such joy.

01:16:18.335 --> 01:16:20.628
COMMENTATOR: Here he comes!

01:16:20.753 --> 01:16:25.215
We could be seeing the biggest thing
to hit grand prix motorcycle racing

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:30.345
since Valentino Rossi arrived
in the premiere class 13 years ago.

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:34.515
Rossi will be disappointed in sixth
place. We ride with Dani Pedrosa.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.143
That speck in front of him
is his teammate Marc Marquez.

01:16:38.268 --> 01:16:42.730
Oh, Dad's looking on.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

01:16:42.855 --> 01:16:45.649
Here he comes through turn 19.
One more corner to go.

01:16:45.774 --> 01:16:48.693
And the Circuit of the Americas
can acclaim Marc Marquez

01:16:48.818 --> 01:16:51.737
through turn 20 he comes.

01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:54.406
Marc Marquez, the youngest ever winner

01:16:54.531 --> 01:17:00.411
of a premiere class grand prix
motorcycle race wins in Texas!

01:17:05.499 --> 01:17:08.418
The crowd rise for the new boy.

01:17:11.671 --> 01:17:16.801
And look, Valentino Rossi
shakes hands with Marc Marquez.

01:17:16.926 --> 01:17:19.261
And a doff of the cap from the doctor.

01:17:36.236 --> 01:17:38.196
(CROWD SINGS HAPPY BIRTHDAY)

01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:50.749
MAN: Surely, nobody better to present
the birthday cake to him

01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:52.667
than his mom, Maria.

01:17:52.792 --> 01:17:56.462
Lorenzo, happy birthday!
26 years old today.

01:17:59.381 --> 01:18:02.008
NARRATOR:
Lorenzo's 26th birthday celebrations

01:18:02.133 --> 01:18:05.302
included the honor
of having the final corner at Jerez,

01:18:05.427 --> 01:18:09.639
the scene of many last lap clashes,
named after him.

01:18:19.607 --> 01:18:22.318
COMMENTATOR: Marc Marquez is going
to have a dig at Jorge Lorenzo.

01:18:22.443 --> 01:18:24.987
Whoa, Marquez, he was forced
to pick the bike up there.

01:18:25.112 --> 01:18:26.780
That could've been both of them.

01:18:26.905 --> 01:18:31.451
NARRATOR: In 2013, Race Direction
introduced a new penalty system

01:18:31.576 --> 01:18:34.161
modeled on the driving license,

01:18:34.286 --> 01:18:36.413
with points imposed
for dangerous riding.

01:18:36.538 --> 01:18:39.666
COMMENTATOR: Whoa, Marquez again!
He's so close to the rear.

01:18:39.791 --> 01:18:41.959
There's inches separating their tires.

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:44.586
WEBB: Marc Marquez made us think
about a point system

01:18:44.711 --> 01:18:48.131
because he was very close
to the limit so many times

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:50.758
that we needed
a way of accounting for that.

01:18:50.883 --> 01:18:52.885
How many times
have we told you to take it easy?

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:56.346
COMMENTATOR: It's just gonna get
worse and worse. Marquez again!

01:18:56.471 --> 01:18:58.848
He was up in the air
fishtailing all over the place!

01:18:58.973 --> 01:19:00.766
He's sideways coming into the corner.

01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:03.977
WEBB: Modeled on the driving license,
everyone understands it.

01:19:04.102 --> 01:19:05.686
We just formalized the warning.

01:19:06.645 --> 01:19:09.481
So instead of just a verbal warning,
it now becomes a point.

01:19:09.606 --> 01:19:13.484
You add up points and you get to four
and you have to start at the back.

01:19:13.609 --> 01:19:15.694
COMMENTATOR: So is there
any way through for Marquez?

01:19:15.819 --> 01:19:18.822
Look at Lorenzo!
He gets away beautifully down there.

01:19:18.947 --> 01:19:22.700
Marquez is going to come through
and he's going to run it wide.

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:24.743
Lorenzo goes wide with him.

01:19:24.868 --> 01:19:26.953
Is there another chance
at the final corner?

01:19:27.078 --> 01:19:30.706
Can he do Lorenzo
at Lorenzo Corner?

01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:33.917
Pedrosa leads.
Is there any way through for Marquez?

01:19:34.042 --> 01:19:35.585
He's going to have a go, you know.

01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:40.339
They collide! They've collided!
How many times have we seen it?

01:19:40.464 --> 01:19:43.800
Marquez has done it!
Oh, in that final corner!

01:19:43.925 --> 01:19:47.053
It's Pedrosa who's gonna come
across the line from Marquez!

01:19:47.178 --> 01:19:49.180
Lorenzo is gonna be furious!

01:19:49.305 --> 01:19:53.309
- MAN: That's Lorenzo's corner.
- Oh, yeah? I didn't think that.

01:19:53.434 --> 01:19:54.768
Have you spoken to him?

01:19:54.893 --> 01:20:00.648
I tried but he doesn't want to.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for him.

01:20:00.773 --> 01:20:04.026
But I know that he can be angry.

01:20:04.151 --> 01:20:06.111
(COMMENTATOR LAUGHS)

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:08.738
COMMENTATOR: The wag
of the finger from Jorge Lorenzo.

01:20:08.863 --> 01:20:11.699
WEBB: Had that incident occurred
earlier in the race,

01:20:11.824 --> 01:20:13.534
we wouldn't have been so lenient.

01:20:13.659 --> 01:20:17.371
But the last corner, the last lap
and Lorenzo left a significant gap

01:20:17.496 --> 01:20:20.999
that any rider in his right mind
would attempt to go through.

01:20:21.124 --> 01:20:23.292
Last corner.

01:20:25.544 --> 01:20:27.337
Two great champions.

01:20:27.462 --> 01:20:30.214
The guy behind tries to go in front

01:20:30.339 --> 01:20:33.050
and the guy in front doesn't want
to arrive behind.

01:20:33.175 --> 01:20:34.718
It happens like this.

01:20:34.843 --> 01:20:38.471
It is also the good things of racing.

01:20:38.596 --> 01:20:43.475
And I'm very upset
that I wasn't fast enough

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.934
to go with Marc.

01:20:45.059 --> 01:20:48.520
and to be in the last corner
together with Marc and Jorge

01:20:48.645 --> 01:20:51.564
because maybe it is also more funny.

01:21:02.366 --> 01:21:04.826
MARQUEZ'S FATHER: What Marc
went through in the first five races

01:21:04.951 --> 01:21:06.744
only he knows.

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:16.295
Until he got to grips with the power
and had some experiences with the bike,

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:19.965
he was taking enormous risks
every session.

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:25.220
MARQUEZ: Every practice, every race,
it was just, "Let's see what happens."

01:21:25.345 --> 01:21:29.182
Every weekend I'd go out on Friday
for the first lap at the limit,

01:21:29.307 --> 01:21:32.184
and I'd finish the last corner
on Sunday at the limit.

01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:38.231
Every session was like, "Let's see
if I fall off or if I can do it."

01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:09.844
RHYS: As soon as the camera panned
to him, we could see he was crawling.

01:22:09.969 --> 01:22:14.223
There wasn't ever that moment
of heart-stopping "Is he OK?"

01:22:16.516 --> 01:22:19.018
To see him moving immediately
even though the visor was off,

01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:22.104
that was a bit of a God-send,
to be honest.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:27.233
My feelings were with his mum and father
who we were with at the medical center.

01:22:27.358 --> 01:22:30.444
We didn't know how bad his face was.
What had happened to his head.

01:22:30.569 --> 01:22:35.448
We could see the visor was off. They
must have nerves of steel, those two.

01:22:35.573 --> 01:22:36.991
MARQUEZ'S MOTHER: I get nervous.

01:22:37.116 --> 01:22:40.953
But I tell myself I must stay calm

01:22:41.078 --> 01:22:42.871
because in the end
you can't fix anything.

01:22:42.996 --> 01:22:45.707
If you get worked up,
what are you going to do?

01:22:45.832 --> 01:22:50.211
You can't fix anything. You can't help
your son if you get nervous.

01:22:53.214 --> 01:22:56.383
On Friday evening he was worried
because his face was all swollen.

01:22:56.508 --> 01:22:59.552
He was icing it.
He said, "Mum, how am I going to look?"

01:23:00.594 --> 01:23:04.639
I brake at the same point.
But just a little bit more aggressive.

01:23:04.764 --> 01:23:08.726
The front wheel was locking, pushed me
to the grass and when I was there,

01:23:08.851 --> 01:23:12.104
I saw the wall,
I was going directly to the wall

01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:14.397
and I just jumped off the bike.

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:16.440
It was better like that.

01:23:16.565 --> 01:23:18.400
MAN: At which speed
did you lose the front?

01:23:18.525 --> 01:23:22.153
MARQUEZ: When I lost the front,
338km/h.

01:23:22.278 --> 01:23:25.864
Then when I crashed, 300km/h.

01:23:26.781 --> 01:23:30.075
This now looks not so good,

01:23:30.301 --> 01:23:33.804
but yesterday it was much worse.

01:23:33.929 --> 01:23:34.930
(LAUGHTER)

01:23:35.055 --> 01:23:36.973
He was very lucky there, very lucky.

01:23:37.098 --> 01:23:40.267
Yeah.
Very, very, very, very, very lucky.

01:23:40.392 --> 01:23:43.603
Because it can be a lot worse.

01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:47.481
But in the end you say,
"We were lucky. Nothing happened."

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:51.693
Just a shock, on we go back to work.

01:23:51.818 --> 01:23:54.362
COMMENTATOR: Round five of the MotoGP
World Championship

01:23:54.487 --> 01:23:57.198
is about to get underway
here in Magello.

01:23:57.323 --> 01:24:00.826
DR COSTA: Marquez was certain to ride.

01:24:00.951 --> 01:24:05.372
He never considered
it would be too difficult.

01:24:05.497 --> 01:24:08.333
He had a lot of bruising
and a fractured shoulder

01:24:08.458 --> 01:24:12.545
but he quickly put the crash
out of his mind

01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:14.171
and he rode a great race.

01:24:18.717 --> 01:24:21.845
LORENZO: To be honest,
I worry about him.

01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:22.971
He's very young.

01:24:23.096 --> 01:24:26.224
And when you are young,
when you are 20, you don't see the risk.

01:24:28.726 --> 01:24:30.728
And I was completely the same as him.

01:24:30.853 --> 01:24:32.813
So I understand him.

01:24:32.938 --> 01:24:37.233
You have this hunger and this ambition.

01:24:37.358 --> 01:24:42.905
And I can do it. I can win
the championship in my first year.

01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:47.242
But anyway, every rider's different.

01:24:47.367 --> 01:24:51.162
You have to respect
the mentality of the riders.

01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:58.002
And this mentality will give him
probably a lot of crashes in the future.

01:24:58.127 --> 01:25:00.504
But also will give him
very good results.

01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:03.715
Until he finally understands

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:08.052
or perceives a little bit more
this kind of risk.

01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:14.891
COMMENTATOR: And that
is Dani Pedrosa who's gone down!

01:25:15.016 --> 01:25:19.729
No, it's Marc Marquez
who's gone from second place.

01:25:19.854 --> 01:25:24.859
ALZAMORA: The important thing
is for Marquez to do as Lorenzo says.

01:25:24.984 --> 01:25:28.570
With crashes and injuries,
you gain the kind of experience

01:25:28.695 --> 01:25:32.657
which led Lorenzo to focus
and become who he is today.

01:25:32.782 --> 01:25:37.578
He who plays chess with danger,
with risk, with death,

01:25:37.703 --> 01:25:44.710
is always a person with the capacity
to endure injuries.

01:25:44.835 --> 01:25:49.965
Your human limits,
the fact of your being mortal,

01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:53.802
helps you to climb
the enchanted mountain of your dreams.

01:25:54.719 --> 01:25:57.638
COMMENTATOR: Jorge Lorenzo has done
the business. And look at that!

01:25:57.763 --> 01:26:01.141
That's why he is number one.
That's why he's world champion.

01:26:01.266 --> 01:26:04.560
He's back with a vengeance.
Second place is Dani Pedrosa.

01:26:04.685 --> 01:26:07.646
Another podium finish
for Cal Crutchlow.

01:26:09.314 --> 01:26:13.318
NARRATOR:
Lorenzo, Pedrosa, Crutchlow.

01:26:13.443 --> 01:26:16.571
Two Spaniards and an Englishman.

01:26:16.696 --> 01:26:19.365
Where's the Italian?
The King of Mugello.

01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:24.536
Seven-times winner here.
Where is Valentino Rossi?

I'm lucky because I'm OK
because it was a bad crash.

01:28:04.925 --> 01:28:07.385
When Bautista hit me on my foot,

01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:11.138
And I lose the control of the bike
and I go to the wall.

01:28:11.263 --> 01:28:13.265
And, "Fuck", I say.

01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:17.060
I was OK,
because I put the bike in front of me.

01:28:17.185 --> 01:28:21.981
But the impact was high. Yeah, bad.

The good thing
is that I didn't get hurt.

01:28:45.961 --> 01:28:49.297
We'll try again in Barcelona
in two weeks.

01:28:53.301 --> 01:28:55.803
I could have had a good race,
I could have been on the podium.

Thank you, everybody.

MAN: Valentino Rossi!

01:29:14.861 --> 01:29:18.114
NARRATOR: Jorge Lorenzo won again
in Catalunya.

01:29:18.239 --> 01:29:20.991
Pedrosa was second ahead of Marquez.

01:29:21.116 --> 01:29:22.575
Rossi was fourth.

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.369
He hadn't been on the podium
since the first race.

01:29:26.495 --> 01:29:29.039
Dani Pedrosa
was leading the championship.

01:29:29.164 --> 01:29:32.041
He'd finished first or second
at the last five races.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.753
If you check the riding style
of the guys that are in front,

01:29:36.878 --> 01:29:40.089
it's a little different
from what it used to be before.

01:29:40.214 --> 01:29:42.591
The rider is much,
much, much, much lower.

01:29:42.716 --> 01:29:44.968
And the bike stays much more up
in the corner.

01:29:45.093 --> 01:29:48.304
If you come from another era,
where the bikes were different

01:29:48.429 --> 01:29:50.973
the riding was different
and the tires were different,

01:29:51.098 --> 01:29:53.892
you have to change your riding style
and that's not so easy.

01:29:54.017 --> 01:29:55.768
EDWARDS: Marquez has it down to a tee.

01:29:55.893 --> 01:29:59.605
He hangs off the bike so far.
Lorenzo as well.

01:30:00.814 --> 01:30:04.275
And I don't know if it be the way...

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.402
tire development or chassis

01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:07.819
or how things have gone,

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:09.403
but the only way to get it to turn

01:30:09.528 --> 01:30:12.489
is basically to drag your elbow
on the ground.

01:30:12.614 --> 01:30:17.327
ROSSI: I have also a lot of bad memories
from the two years before.

01:30:17.452 --> 01:30:24.417
And I need the time for recreate
the same feeling with the M1.

01:30:25.918 --> 01:30:29.421
PEDROSA: In a sport career,
there is a moment which is magic.

01:30:29.546 --> 01:30:32.757
Everything goes well around you.

01:30:32.882 --> 01:30:36.260
When it goes by, it's very hard
to get back the same thing,

01:30:36.385 --> 01:30:38.053
because you are not the same guy.

01:30:38.178 --> 01:30:42.223
These new guys are coming and pushing.

01:30:43.098 --> 01:30:47.352
LORENZO'S FATHER: I've analyzed Rossi
and he's trying harder than ever.

01:30:47.477 --> 01:30:50.104
He's changed
his riding style completely.

01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:54.733
This is Rossi when he started in MotoGP.

01:30:54.858 --> 01:30:59.737
This riding style
dates from the Eighties.

01:30:59.862 --> 01:31:03.574
He's moved his butt,
but he's holding his head up.

01:31:05.576 --> 01:31:08.412
This is Valentino Rossi now.

01:31:08.537 --> 01:31:10.789
His head is a long way off the bike.

01:31:10.914 --> 01:31:14.208
His spinal column makes a V
with the bike.

01:31:14.333 --> 01:31:19.796
He's adapted to the new riding style,
which the young riders are using,

01:31:19.921 --> 01:31:23.090
but maybe he hasn't
yet understood this style.

01:31:23.215 --> 01:31:26.927
NARRATOR: Rossi crashed in testing
the day after the Catalan race.

01:31:27.052 --> 01:31:30.555
Storms hit the next tests
in Aragon later that week.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:34.225
Then the sun came out
and things got better.

01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:35.893
I'm happy. It's a good test.

01:31:36.018 --> 01:31:40.939
I feel good on the bike. The first
feeling is that we make a step.

01:31:41.064 --> 01:31:42.690
NARRATOR: Next stop, Holland.

01:31:44.024 --> 01:31:48.153
COMMENTATOR: It's round seven!
It's the last Saturday in June.

01:31:48.987 --> 01:31:56.327
I've always had faith.
I always expected to see him win again.

01:31:58.787 --> 01:32:02.624
I knew he liked that circuit.

01:32:04.292 --> 01:32:06.002
COMMENTATOR:
Lap one about to be completed.

01:32:06.127 --> 01:32:07.878
Here comes Rossi inside Stefan Bradl.

01:32:08.003 --> 01:32:11.548
And Rossi moves into third place.
Very aggressively.

01:32:11.673 --> 01:32:18.054
DON STEFANO: Once again he's making
the kind of passes that he used to make.

01:32:18.179 --> 01:32:20.431
COMMENTATOR:
Marc Marquez in front of him.

01:32:20.556 --> 01:32:22.140
Both of them know
about winning in Assen.

01:32:22.265 --> 01:32:25.726
Marquez has won three times here.
Rossi seven.

01:32:25.851 --> 01:32:27.561
He's gone through!

01:32:27.686 --> 01:32:30.563
WOMAN:
He made two or three beautiful passes.

01:32:30.688 --> 01:32:36.026
It was so exciting to see
how the crowd responded.

01:32:36.151 --> 01:32:40.196
ROSSI: I fight with everybody.
I fight with Marc. I fight with Pedrosa.

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:43.907
PALMA: He was beautiful to watch,
elegant like before.

01:32:52.165 --> 01:32:57.795
ROSSI: I'm always a little bit faster
in some places. I feel good.

01:32:58.837 --> 01:33:01.422
COMMENTATOR: They cross the line.
There'll be three laps to go.

01:33:01.547 --> 01:33:04.675
DON STEFANO:
I waited until the last three laps,

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:09.346
then I went and opened the door
to the bell tower

01:33:09.471 --> 01:33:11.222
and turned on the lights.

01:33:11.347 --> 01:33:14.475
Then I hurried back to see the end.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:19.730
COMMENTATOR: He is chasing
his 106th Grand Prix victory.

01:33:19.855 --> 01:33:23.984
He hasn't won a Grand Prix
for over two and a half years.

01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:26.820
He's half a lap away.

01:33:27.737 --> 01:33:29.447
They cannot believe it.

01:33:29.572 --> 01:33:32.950
They cannot watch
back at Valentino Rossi's garage.

01:33:33.075 --> 01:33:35.702
(CHEERING)

01:33:43.418 --> 01:33:47.046
Valentino Rossi wins here in Assen!

01:33:47.171 --> 01:33:50.299
(CHURCH BELLS RING)

01:34:06.064 --> 01:34:10.485
We did wonder if we would ever see him
win a grand prix again.

01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:14.989
When he won the last race in Malaysia,
it was his 46th win with Yamaha.

01:34:15.114 --> 01:34:20.327
And now, after not winning for 46 races,
he has won again.

01:34:20.452 --> 01:34:26.416
So 46 follows us
through good times and bad.

01:34:41.639 --> 01:34:47.519
ROSSI: I cannot believe. It was a long,
long time from Sepang in 2010.

01:34:47.644 --> 01:34:53.691
In these years,
I make to me also this question.

01:34:53.816 --> 01:34:56.568
I can come back
on the first position or not?

01:34:56.693 --> 01:34:59.696
It was a tough period.

01:35:11.749 --> 01:35:15.252
DON STEFANO: The bells are automatic.

01:35:15.377 --> 01:35:19.089
I went out and forgot about them.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:22.884
I left them ringing and went to the bar.

01:35:23.009 --> 01:35:25.594
We had a bit of a party.

01:35:30.515 --> 01:35:33.976
DON GIUSEPPE:
For a long time, a very long time,

01:35:34.101 --> 01:35:36.770
he left them ringing and ringing
and ringing.

01:35:44.152 --> 01:35:48.281
NARRATOR: And Jorge Lorenzo,
he had an incredible weekend.

01:35:49.615 --> 01:35:52.451
LORENZO: In Assen from the beginning
I felt even better

01:35:52.576 --> 01:35:55.370
than in Mugello and Montmelo.

01:35:55.495 --> 01:35:59.457
These two victories
give me too much confidence.

01:35:59.582 --> 01:36:03.711
I was overconfident.
That was my mistake.

01:36:07.506 --> 01:36:12.844
The corner I crashed, I entered like
I was on the dry. 250km/h.

01:36:13.594 --> 01:36:16.722
MAN: Jorge's accident in Assen
was about four seconds.

01:36:16.847 --> 01:36:19.182
One of the longest accidents we've seen.

01:36:25.188 --> 01:36:27.565
The first impact was with the elbow.

01:36:27.690 --> 01:36:30.651
That transferred energy
into the shoulder.

01:36:30.776 --> 01:36:33.195
That caused the crack in the collarbone.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.364
LORENZO: I was thinking
that I would lose the championship,

01:36:36.489 --> 01:36:37.823
I lose two or three races.

01:36:37.948 --> 01:36:41.493
Every time I move just one centimeter,
I felt so much pain.

01:36:42.327 --> 01:36:44.954
I wanted to get operated
as soon as possible.

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:49.726
I couldn't wait for even one night
because the pain was so high.

01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:53.062
So we went to the hospital
close to Assen.

01:36:53.187 --> 01:36:58.192
I informed Jorge
that if you operate tonight,

01:36:58.317 --> 01:37:01.862
you can do push-ups tomorrow
and we can try to ride on the warm-up.

01:37:01.987 --> 01:37:04.572
And to see how it feels, step by step.

01:37:04.697 --> 01:37:06.657
He was, "It's impossible, Wilco."

01:37:06.782 --> 01:37:10.827
I said, "I've had my collarbone broken
with a plate on it."

01:37:10.952 --> 01:37:11.953
You know, it's not a joint.

01:37:12.078 --> 01:37:14.455
A collarbone is something fixed.

01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.415
And as soon
as you have the plate on it,

01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:20.168
if you have the support
from the collarbone you can ride a bike.

01:37:20.293 --> 01:37:22.586
Finally, after four or five hours,

01:37:22.711 --> 01:37:27.215
we decided to rent a private plane

01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:28.507
and go to Barcelona.

01:37:28.632 --> 01:37:32.510
And in one hour and a half
I was getting operated.

01:37:32.635 --> 01:37:37.473
When I wake up after the operation,
I was feeling much better.

01:37:37.598 --> 01:37:42.144
Much less pain. And we started
to think about coming back.

01:37:42.269 --> 01:37:46.773
ZEELENBERG: Soon as we arrived
back in Assen, he said,

01:37:46.898 --> 01:37:51.777
"If I get green light from the doctor
tomorrow morning, we try."

01:37:51.902 --> 01:37:54.779
DOCTOR: It's the medical director
at each circuit who decides.

01:37:54.904 --> 01:37:57.406
I personally advised him not to race.

01:37:57.531 --> 01:38:03.245
He said "If I lose ten points,
it could cost me the championship."

01:38:04.871 --> 01:38:08.583
MAN:
There was a kind of euphoria in him,

01:38:08.708 --> 01:38:14.171
which he communicated
to everybody who saw him race.

01:38:14.296 --> 01:38:18.174
We prepared him
from a medical point of view.

01:38:18.299 --> 01:38:21.302
A few painkillers.

01:38:21.427 --> 01:38:26.432
But making possible
this unimaginable thing,

01:38:26.557 --> 01:38:28.976
that was all down to Lorenzo's heart.

01:38:30.394 --> 01:38:36.900
They told me also if I crash again,
my career can be over.

01:38:37.025 --> 01:38:40.111
So they scared me a little bit.

01:38:40.236 --> 01:38:44.156
ZEELENBERG: He felt quite OK,
because he was very fit before the crash

01:38:44.281 --> 01:38:46.157
and I think that helped him a lot.

01:38:50.077 --> 01:38:54.664
At a certain point in their lives,
they find the strength,

01:38:54.789 --> 01:38:56.457
the will,

01:38:56.582 --> 01:39:00.127
the strong desire within them

01:39:00.252 --> 01:39:02.462
to achieve something impossible.

01:39:03.963 --> 01:39:09.927
And so there is something mythological
about their lives.

01:39:10.052 --> 01:39:11.845
COMMENTATOR:
He's now into fifth place.

01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:15.932
Crutchlow runs a little bit wide.
Is Lorenzo gonna go through?

01:39:16.057 --> 01:39:18.225
He doesn't need
any invitation whatsoever.

01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:20.560
COMMENTATOR 2:
We ride with Jorge Lorenzo!

01:39:20.685 --> 01:39:22.061
He's closing up now on Marc Marquez.

01:39:22.186 --> 01:39:24.146
LORENZO: I was catching the front group,

01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:26.189
Dani, Valentino and Marc.

01:39:26.314 --> 01:39:30.693
I couldn't believe I was doing this
36 hours after my operation.

01:39:30.818 --> 01:39:35.030
COMMENTATOR: Fourteen and a half laps
to go. Lorenzo beginning to slow.

01:39:56.801 --> 01:40:01.639
LORENZO: It was very emotional,
especially after I finished the race.

01:40:01.764 --> 01:40:05.225
After knowing what you did.

01:40:06.184 --> 01:40:08.686
I was crying inside my helmet,

01:40:08.811 --> 01:40:11.563
because of the pain I felt

01:40:11.688 --> 01:40:14.982
during this 36 hours.

01:40:15.107 --> 01:40:20.153
But also crying
about the emotion of doing this thing.

01:40:20.278 --> 01:40:22.655
NARRATOR:
Pedrosa still led the championship.

01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:25.157
But Lorenzo
had only lost three points to him.

01:40:42.215 --> 01:40:44.342
LORENZO: I couldn't believe that I crash

01:40:44.467 --> 01:40:49.346
and again
I re-injure the same collarbone.

01:40:49.471 --> 01:40:53.183
We change something on the electronic,
the behavior of the engine.

01:40:53.308 --> 01:40:56.936
I'm sure that creates this big slide
that I had.

01:40:57.061 --> 01:41:00.606
My physical condition was not right
to make some experiments.

01:41:00.731 --> 01:41:06.570
So, it was a mistake of me.
I felt again too much overconfidence.

01:41:06.695 --> 01:41:07.946
And I repeat the same mistake

01:41:08.071 --> 01:41:11.282
with the bad luck that I impacted
the same collarbone.

01:41:12.491 --> 01:41:15.535
ZEELENBERG:
Another operation. Another surgery.

01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:18.996
That damaged his condition much more.

01:41:19.121 --> 01:41:21.081
I'm going home.

01:41:21.206 --> 01:41:23.208
Good luck.

01:41:23.333 --> 01:41:27.086
NARRATOR: Lorenzo's misfortune
was Dani Pedrosa's opportunity.

01:41:27.211 --> 01:41:30.172
MAN: Good luck.

01:41:30.297 --> 01:41:31.381
I hope it goes well.

01:41:31.506 --> 01:41:35.718
PEDROSA: Jorge crashed on Friday.
I had 23 points lead over Marc.

01:41:35.843 --> 01:41:38.262
I had like a highway
for the championship.

01:41:43.308 --> 01:41:45.852
Everything can change in one second,
you know?

01:41:51.274 --> 01:41:52.650
It's broken.

01:41:54.234 --> 01:41:59.739
Unfortunately it's my way...
in my career.

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:05.244
ROSSI: You have to think also
about the past.

01:42:05.369 --> 01:42:11.041
Dani now has a lot of problems
with his body, bad injuries.

01:42:11.166 --> 01:42:12.500
A lot of difficult recovery,

01:42:12.625 --> 01:42:17.254
so I think that for Dani
it's more difficult than for Jorge.

01:42:19.381 --> 01:42:21.341
NARRATOR:
With Pedrosa and Lorenzo out,

01:42:21.466 --> 01:42:23.551
the championship had a new leader.

01:42:25.386 --> 01:42:28.931
Halfway through the season,
the rookie was on top.

01:42:30.891 --> 01:42:33.852
MARQUEZ: So now I'm leading
the world championship.

01:42:33.977 --> 01:42:39.983
If you tell me that on the pre-season,
I would say you are crazy.

01:42:40.108 --> 01:42:46.989
Big surprise even for me.
But, you know, it's a great moment.

01:42:49.950 --> 01:42:54.829
ANNOUNCER: And I for one enjoy
this peaceful moment before.

01:43:09.885 --> 01:43:13.471
PEDROSA: The first thing
from the doctors was not to ride

01:43:13.596 --> 01:43:16.015
because the fracture is there.

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:21.895
And it's only 20% of the bone
remaining together.

01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:26.107
If I had a crash,
immediately, full crack.

01:43:26.232 --> 01:43:30.653
This collarbone
is very hard to operate, mine,

01:43:30.778 --> 01:43:35.199
because already many times
I had problems here.

01:43:36.074 --> 01:43:37.075
So I take the risk.

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.369
LORENZO: I didn't want to race
in Laguna, to be honest.

01:43:40.494 --> 01:43:46.750
But when I saw Dani crash,
I rethink, I am going to Laguna.

COMMENTATOR: Lorenzo extremely wide
coming through turn two.

01:44:49.601 --> 01:44:53.896
LORENZO: For me, it was even harder
to finish the race than it was in Assen,

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:56.273
because my physical condition
was much worse

01:44:56.398 --> 01:44:58.274
after one month without training.

01:45:02.653 --> 01:45:06.740
So, the sixth place for me
was even with more merit.

01:45:10.994 --> 01:45:14.330
PEDROSA: One point more I take
than him in this race.

01:45:14.455 --> 01:45:17.916
But our main rival was winning.

01:45:18.041 --> 01:45:20.126
COMMENTATOR:
He goes around the outside.

01:45:20.251 --> 01:45:21.418
Rossi will try and come back.

01:45:21.543 --> 01:45:25.463
Oh, then Marquez goes through
on the inside of The Corkscrew.

01:45:25.588 --> 01:45:28.257
The Valentino Rossi Memorial line.

01:45:28.382 --> 01:45:31.635
He's at the final corner here
at Laguna Seca.

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.347
Marc Marquez makes his debut
at Laguna Seca with a victory.

01:45:36.472 --> 01:45:38.891
Opens up a bigger lead
in the world championship.

01:45:39.016 --> 01:45:41.685
First rider to win here at Laguna Seca
on his debut.

01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:45.188
The youngest ever rider to score
back-to-back grand prix wins.

01:45:51.694 --> 01:45:53.737
I say this is a fucking bastard.

01:46:04.998 --> 01:46:08.126
NARRATOR: While Lorenzo and Pedrosa
were handicapped by injury,

01:46:08.251 --> 01:46:13.089
Marquez won four races in a row.
He didn't put a foot wrong

01:46:13.214 --> 01:46:15.674
until the morning
of the British Grand Prix.

01:46:17.342 --> 01:46:19.177
It was around ten o'clock.

01:46:19.302 --> 01:46:23.014
Cal Crutchlow went down
a few hundred yards ahead of Marquez.

01:46:23.139 --> 01:46:26.142
The marshals around the track
were waving yellow flags...

01:46:27.685 --> 01:46:30.771
...warning the oncoming riders
to slow down.

01:46:31.688 --> 01:46:33.940
Marquez didn't see the flags.

01:46:39.445 --> 01:46:42.156
Fortunately, the marshals saw Marquez.

01:46:49.037 --> 01:46:52.790
He would get two points on his license
for irresponsible riding.

01:46:52.915 --> 01:46:56.084
WEBB: He copped two points
for nearly taking out the marshals.

01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:58.169
That was quite a big safety deal.

01:46:58.294 --> 01:47:02.131
NARRATOR: Marquez had a more immediate
problem. A dislocated shoulder.

01:47:02.256 --> 01:47:04.132
MARQUEZ: It was dislocated.

01:47:04.257 --> 01:47:07.343
Some ligaments were
a little bit damaged.

01:47:07.468 --> 01:47:11.680
NARRATOR: The race was at 2:00pm.
He had four hours to recover.

01:47:14.349 --> 01:47:17.685
Meanwhile, Jorge Lorenzo
was feeling good again.

01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:19.686
LORENZO: I felt stronger than in Brno.

01:47:19.811 --> 01:47:22.814
So on Sunday morning
when he crashed in the warm up,

01:47:22.939 --> 01:47:28.945
I knew his confidence and probably
his physical condition could be worse.

01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:34.033
So I say, this is my chance to attack
and to win this race.

01:47:34.158 --> 01:47:37.452
MARQUEZ: I knew it before the race
that Jorge would push a lot

01:47:37.577 --> 01:47:41.122
in the beginning of the race
because he knew I was injured.

01:47:41.247 --> 01:47:42.414
I need to do a good start.

01:47:48.711 --> 01:47:52.798
And it was like, he pushed a lot,
but I was able to be behind him.

01:47:52.923 --> 01:47:55.759
Also I know that the end of the race
will be harder for me,

01:47:55.884 --> 01:48:00.305
because I feel tired
from the shoulder.

01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:03.933
LORENZO: What happened?
I started better than him. I passed him.

01:48:04.058 --> 01:48:06.685
But he was in my ass all the race.

01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:12.190
So even injured, he was there.
Not giving up.

01:48:12.315 --> 01:48:17.194
I tried to improve my lap time
to get away. I couldn't.

01:48:18.403 --> 01:48:19.445
Then he came.

01:48:19.570 --> 01:48:23.824
He passed me in one braking
that I knew he was stronger.

01:48:25.784 --> 01:48:28.953
So I tried to study him
for half a lap

01:48:29.078 --> 01:48:32.081
and I see the occasion to pass him
in the braking point.

01:48:32.206 --> 01:48:35.042
COMMENTATOR: Here he comes!
Lorenzo's going to lead.

01:48:35.167 --> 01:48:37.669
He's not going to give an inch
to Marquez.

01:48:37.794 --> 01:48:39.712
Lorenzo takes the lead once more.

01:48:39.837 --> 01:48:44.883
LORENZO: And in the last lap I went
even faster trying to open the lead up.

01:48:45.008 --> 01:48:48.594
But the problem is that I entered
too quick in the chicane

01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:51.948
that I lose the front
and then he recovers two tenths.

01:48:52.073 --> 01:48:54.658
MARQUEZ: And he makes a small mistake,
then I catch him.

01:48:54.783 --> 01:48:57.619
LORENZO: So I say he's going
to try in the hard braking again.

01:48:57.744 --> 01:49:00.747
So I tried to close the door,
but then I brake too hard

01:49:00.872 --> 01:49:04.083
and the rear wheel starts to snake
and I was going wide.

01:49:04.208 --> 01:49:05.667
MARQUEZ: I was able to pass him.

01:49:05.792 --> 01:49:07.668
COMMENTATOR:
Marquez dives for the inside line.

01:49:07.793 --> 01:49:10.086
LORENZO: For a moment
I thought I finish second.

01:49:10.211 --> 01:49:13.172
MARQUEZ: Then on that last corner
when I changed direction,

01:49:13.297 --> 01:49:16.341
I feel no power, I go a little bit wide.

01:49:16.466 --> 01:49:19.719
LORENZO: I have to try. This is
my chance. I have to win this race.

01:49:19.844 --> 01:49:21.762
COMMENTATOR:
It's gonna be a drag to the line

01:49:21.887 --> 01:49:23.263
between the Yamaha and the Honda.

01:49:25.598 --> 01:49:29.768
Jorge Lorenzo wins an incredible battle
here at Silverstone!

01:49:40.445 --> 01:49:42.989
NARRATOR: Lorenzo won
the next race in San Marino,

01:49:43.114 --> 01:49:47.785
cutting Marquez's lead to 34 points
with five races to go.

01:49:48.994 --> 01:49:53.123
It was Rossi's home race.
He was fourth. Again.

01:49:54.958 --> 01:49:58.503
In the second half of the season,
he was on and off the podium.

01:49:58.628 --> 01:50:00.588
More off than on.

01:50:00.713 --> 01:50:03.424
Almost there, but not quite.

01:50:03.549 --> 01:50:07.594
What was it? The bike? Or the rider?

01:50:08.511 --> 01:50:13.349
I don't know what's happening
inside Valentino right now.

01:50:13.474 --> 01:50:18.312
Because, you know, after two years
with the problem we know

01:50:18.437 --> 01:50:21.857
and after the bad story of Marco,

01:50:21.982 --> 01:50:24.943
I don't know
what is rolling around his head.

01:50:25.068 --> 01:50:29.197
For that reason, I have more respect
for Valentino now.

01:50:29.864 --> 01:50:34.869
I consider him a strong person,
not a strong champion. It's different.

01:50:34.994 --> 01:50:39.873
For me, it's not important if he win
one more championship.

01:50:39.998 --> 01:50:42.417
I like the story of Valentino Rossi.

01:50:42.542 --> 01:50:45.711
The biggest respect
for a guy such as him.

01:50:45.836 --> 01:50:49.881
MAN: A question for Vale. Your helmet.
What can you say about the new design?

01:50:50.006 --> 01:50:53.009
ROSSI: This time we decide to make
something more serious.

01:50:53.134 --> 01:50:57.138
Because already quite a long time
that Marco is not with us.

01:50:57.263 --> 01:51:04.311
But here is his home racetrack.
The circuit is in his name.

01:51:04.436 --> 01:51:09.149
So we decide to remember him.
A tribute to remember him.

01:51:09.274 --> 01:51:15.113
We made something for Marco not using
the brand, the two red stripes.

01:51:15.238 --> 01:51:18.991
Only a song.
Valentino sent me the text.

01:51:21.243 --> 01:51:23.662
And he chose a part of the text.

01:51:23.787 --> 01:51:26.998
And we reproduce it around the helmet.

01:51:27.123 --> 01:51:31.460
Every time I read the text, mamma mia,

01:51:31.585 --> 01:51:34.087
and at the end talking about fear.

01:51:34.212 --> 01:51:35.463
The same fear.

01:51:35.588 --> 01:51:37.089
(WISH YOU WERE HERE BY PINK FLOYD)

01:51:52.062 --> 01:51:56.399
How I wish, how I wish you were here

01:51:58.692 --> 01:52:04.030
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl

01:52:04.155 --> 01:52:05.948
Year after year

01:52:07.783 --> 01:52:10.827
Running over the same old ground

01:52:11.744 --> 01:52:16.707
Have we found the same old fears?

01:52:17.874 --> 01:52:20.418
Wish you were here

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.716
SIMONCELLI'S FATHER:
It was hard to imagine

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:30.593
people would miss Marco so much.

01:52:30.718 --> 01:52:34.805
He really has left a deep mark.

01:52:35.764 --> 01:52:40.560
It makes you proud and a little sad.

01:52:42.311 --> 01:52:45.731
MOODY: People's heroes are
the sportsmen that people want to be.

01:52:45.856 --> 01:52:49.484
And people wanted to be
Marco Simoncelli.

01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:51.193
Not because he won a MotoGP race.

01:52:51.318 --> 01:52:55.113
But because
he was just cool, quirky, different,

01:52:55.238 --> 01:52:59.158
shunned the society of MotoGP,
stood his own ground.

01:52:59.283 --> 01:53:00.909
He said, "I'm gonna do it my way."

01:53:01.034 --> 01:53:04.537
But, he's not here
and it's just horrible.

01:53:04.662 --> 01:53:08.040
It was a horrible, horrible day.

01:53:13.962 --> 01:53:15.880
NARRATOR: Five races to go.

01:53:16.005 --> 01:53:19.258
125 points on the table.

01:53:19.383 --> 01:53:23.011
Pedrosa and Lorenzo were still
in with a chance of the title.

01:53:24.137 --> 01:53:26.889
Dani Pedrosa was finally back
to full fitness.

01:53:28.223 --> 01:53:29.766
It was his birthday.

01:53:31.017 --> 01:53:35.396
PEDROSA: There are five races left.
So there is no more time for anything.

01:53:35.521 --> 01:53:38.440
You have to put it all on the table
and go for it.

01:53:38.565 --> 01:53:40.358
You have to have some good luck.

01:53:45.279 --> 01:53:48.490
COMMENTATOR: Pedrosa is all over
the rear of Marc Marquez now.

01:53:48.615 --> 01:53:51.409
And Pedrosa is through
and into second place.

01:53:51.534 --> 01:53:53.494
He's good and determined.

01:53:53.619 --> 01:53:58.206
The strongest we've seen Dani Pedrosa
certainly since that crash in Germany.

01:53:59.332 --> 01:54:02.084
This is a race he really has to win.

01:54:02.209 --> 01:54:03.960
Marquez is going to get very close.

01:54:04.085 --> 01:54:06.462
He's going to have
to pick the bike up.

01:54:06.587 --> 01:54:10.799
You could see that a mile off.
And Pedrosa has gone down!

01:54:10.924 --> 01:54:12.759
Dani Pedrosa has gone!

01:54:12.884 --> 01:54:18.389
Goodbye, world championship 2013
for Dani Pedrosa.

01:54:18.514 --> 01:54:20.766
Pedrosa is hurting.

01:54:20.891 --> 01:54:23.476
He was putting
all the pressure on Lorenzo.

01:54:23.601 --> 01:54:28.063
Marquez had to run it wide as well.
Did they actually touch?

01:54:28.188 --> 01:54:32.942
I was leaning and I only felt "clack"
on my rear tire.

01:54:33.067 --> 01:54:38.530
I thought he'd touched my exhaust pipe.
After that, I don't remember much.

01:54:38.655 --> 01:54:41.658
NARRATOR: On the rear of the Honda
there is a wheel speed sensor,

01:54:41.783 --> 01:54:44.869
which is part
of the traction-control system.

01:54:44.994 --> 01:54:48.330
The electronic system
contours the power delivery.

01:54:48.455 --> 01:54:51.958
Without it, the bike is unrideable.

01:54:52.083 --> 01:54:55.211
Some part of Marquez's machine
hit and severed the cable

01:54:55.336 --> 01:54:57.379
connecting the sensor to the system

01:54:57.504 --> 01:55:00.215
instantly disabling
Pedrosa's traction control.

01:55:01.299 --> 01:55:03.592
It was the slightest possible touch.

01:55:03.717 --> 01:55:05.468
But it carried a knockout punch.

01:55:06.677 --> 01:55:09.179
When he opened the throttle
at the exit of the corner,

01:55:09.304 --> 01:55:12.640
the engine delivered a massive hit
of power to the rear wheel.

01:55:22.483 --> 01:55:25.611
COMMENTATOR: He's done it again.
In front of the home crowd.

01:55:25.736 --> 01:55:28.864
He's got one hand now
on that world championship trophy.

01:55:28.989 --> 01:55:32.784
Of course he can make mistakes.
We've seen mistakes from him today.

01:55:32.909 --> 01:55:35.953
He just seems to be able
to ride his luck all the time.

01:55:38.997 --> 01:55:40.832
NARRATOR: After the Aragon incident,

01:55:40.957 --> 01:55:44.627
Marquez found himself
back in front of Race Direction.

01:55:44.752 --> 01:55:48.922
Another two-point penalty would see him
starting the next race from the back.

01:55:49.047 --> 01:55:51.049
MAN: Good morning. Hi Marc, how are you?

01:55:51.174 --> 01:55:53.759
- Fine, thanks.
- MAN: What are you expecting?

01:55:53.884 --> 01:55:55.218
I don't know. We'll see.

01:55:57.136 --> 01:56:00.097
WEBB: It's a formal hearing.
There's four members of race direction.

01:56:00.222 --> 01:56:03.225
We work as a group,
the four of us have a hearing,

01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:05.935
the rider gets called in
with his team representative.

01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:09.063
We explain what he's there for.

01:56:09.188 --> 01:56:12.399
We listen to both sides of the story
and then make a decision.

01:56:13.358 --> 01:56:15.902
For Marc Marquez,
we have added one penalty point

01:56:16.027 --> 01:56:21.032
to his total for the 2013 season
due to irresponsible riding.

01:56:21.157 --> 01:56:23.742
No rider wants to be told
they're doing the wrong thing.

01:56:23.867 --> 01:56:27.203
They always have an opinion
that's not the same as ours.

01:56:27.328 --> 01:56:29.872
And he can be quite angry.

01:56:29.997 --> 01:56:31.832
More and more these days

01:56:31.957 --> 01:56:34.876
he understands
why we're saying what we're saying.

01:56:35.001 --> 01:56:37.586
Like I said,
for me it was a racing incident.

01:56:37.711 --> 01:56:41.089
Just that. It was very bad luck
that I hit the cable.

01:56:41.214 --> 01:56:46.385
But if I hadn't hit the cable,
nobody would have realized I hit Dani.

01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:51.306
The limit is when one guy
puts in danger other guys.

01:56:51.431 --> 01:56:52.682
This is the limit.

01:56:52.807 --> 01:56:55.059
It was a very light touch.

01:56:55.184 --> 01:56:59.396
But fine, they obviously
wanted to give me a point.

01:56:59.521 --> 01:57:03.483
And as riders we have to respect that.

01:57:03.608 --> 01:57:06.235
Many of us could be more aggressive.

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.029
And many of us could be
touching others like this.

01:57:09.154 --> 01:57:10.864
But we don't do it.

01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:15.451
MARQUEZ: A lot of people complain,
but it's my riding style.

01:57:15.576 --> 01:57:18.161
If I don't ride like that,
I cannot be fast.

01:57:18.286 --> 01:57:19.620
Sometimes I try to change.

01:57:19.745 --> 01:57:22.372
I try to be smooth,
but in the end if I'm concentrating,

01:57:22.497 --> 01:57:26.375
if I want to push,
I need to be like that.

01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:30.086
NARRATOR: Dani Pedrosa had the
satisfaction of beating Marc Marquez

01:57:30.211 --> 01:57:31.837
in the Malaysian Grand Prix.

01:57:33.088 --> 01:57:35.131
PEDROSA:
It's a great feeling, this one.

01:57:35.256 --> 01:57:40.803
NARRATOR: But Marquez beat Lorenzo for
second extending his lead to 43 points.

01:57:41.845 --> 01:57:45.765
He could clinch the world title
the following week in Australia.

01:57:49.643 --> 01:57:52.520
COMMENTATOR: Marc Marquez
has been black-flagged.

01:57:52.645 --> 01:57:57.316
Honda have made
one massive, massive mistake.

01:57:57.441 --> 01:58:00.193
NARRATOR: The Phillip Island track
had been re-surfaced

01:58:00.318 --> 01:58:02.320
since the last MotoGP race there.

01:58:02.445 --> 01:58:05.489
In the practice sessions,
it turned out that the new asphalt

01:58:05.614 --> 01:58:10.035
gave so much grip that the tires
couldn't handle more than a few laps.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.872
The rubber would disintegrate
over full race distance.

01:58:14.873 --> 01:58:18.251
Race Direction ordered the teams
to make a pit stop during the race

01:58:18.376 --> 01:58:21.921
when the riders would switch
to their second bike with fresh tires.

01:58:22.046 --> 01:58:27.384
Any rider completing more than ten laps
would be penalized.

01:58:27.509 --> 01:58:29.010
ZEELENBERG: It was a new rule

01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:32.179
and I was very worried
that Jorge would miss the board.

01:58:32.304 --> 01:58:36.850
So, I went to Race Direction to ask
if he missed the board, what then?

01:58:36.975 --> 01:58:39.686
Black flag, 100%.

01:58:39.811 --> 01:58:42.688
COMMENTATOR: They've got to come in!
Marquez has stayed out there!

01:58:42.914 --> 01:58:47.168
Marquez has stayed out on the track!
I do not believe this!

01:58:47.293 --> 01:58:50.087
But surely,
Marquez has gone a lap too far!

01:58:50.212 --> 01:58:53.006
NARRATOR: Marquez's team
was looking for an advantage.

01:58:53.131 --> 01:58:57.802
An extra lap with a clear track and
a light fuel load could provide that.

01:58:58.886 --> 01:59:02.890
All we know is that part of the team
had made a mistake

01:59:03.015 --> 01:59:04.558
on the counting down of the laps.

01:59:04.683 --> 01:59:07.143
A part of the team knew already from,
"Hey, ten! He has to come in."

01:59:07.268 --> 01:59:11.146
And part didn't know, they thought,
"No, no. It's the end of lap ten."

01:59:11.271 --> 01:59:13.022
So, they were a little bit confused.

01:59:17.484 --> 01:59:20.737
RHYS: It's embarrassing for us.
It was a mistake that was made.

01:59:20.862 --> 01:59:23.948
We take it and move on. I hope it
doesn't affect the championship.

01:59:24.073 --> 01:59:27.493
If it does, it'll come back
and haunt us and that's the way it is.

01:59:33.665 --> 01:59:36.042
- How many fingers do you see here?
- MAN: I see ten.

01:59:36.167 --> 01:59:37.918
Then you can work for Repsol Honda.

01:59:38.877 --> 01:59:41.838
NARRATOR: Jorge Lorenzo
won the Australian Grand Prix

01:59:41.963 --> 01:59:44.256
from Dani Pedrosa and Valentino Rossi.

01:59:44.381 --> 01:59:48.259
There were two races to go.
Fifty points on the table.

01:59:48.384 --> 01:59:51.887
Just 18 points
between Lorenzo and Marquez.

01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:55.932
Then a typhoon hit Japan
the week of the grand prix.

01:59:56.057 --> 02:00:00.061
The weather wiped out practice
on Friday and Saturday.

02:00:00.186 --> 02:00:03.772
Everything, practice and the race,
happened on Sunday.

02:00:04.606 --> 02:00:08.776
Marquez had a single session to
figure out the track on a MotoGP bike.

02:00:08.901 --> 02:00:12.237
And to endure
his 15th crash of the season.

02:00:13.488 --> 02:00:16.782
COMMENTATOR: If he were to win the race
today and Lorenzo were to be third,

02:00:16.907 --> 02:00:23.246
then he would be the youngest ever
world champion in the premiere class.

02:00:23.371 --> 02:00:26.040
NARRATOR:
Jorge Lorenzo had other ideas.

02:00:26.165 --> 02:00:28.959
He led the race from start to finish.

02:00:29.084 --> 02:00:32.295
COMMENTATOR: Marc Marquez
thought, hoped, prayed,

02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:34.296
he'd capture the world title.

02:00:34.421 --> 02:00:37.465
But it's not gonna happen
here in Japan.

02:00:37.590 --> 02:00:44.555
A classic ride from the world champion
Jorge Lorenzo who wins here in Japan.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.224
NARRATOR:
Thirteen points between them.

02:00:47.349 --> 02:00:50.185
It was down
to the final race in Valencia.

02:00:56.816 --> 02:01:00.528
Two things had to happen
for Jorge Lorenzo to take the title.

02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:02.363
He had to win the race

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:05.741
and Marc Marquez
had to finish fifth or lower.

02:01:06.867 --> 02:01:11.329
All that Marquez needed was a safe run
to fourth place or better.

02:01:11.454 --> 02:01:15.458
Lorenzo had a plan.
Get to the front and then slow down.

02:01:15.583 --> 02:01:18.002
Make the riders behind bunch up.

02:01:18.127 --> 02:01:22.005
And hope that Marquez tangles
with another rider or makes a mistake.

02:01:23.214 --> 02:01:27.384
If another rider got in front of him,
Lorenzo would have to retake the lead,

02:01:27.509 --> 02:01:30.678
then repeat the process of slowing down
the riders behind him

02:01:30.803 --> 02:01:34.056
and trying to make life hazardous
for Marquez.

02:01:34.181 --> 02:01:39.144
LORENZO: It was the first time that
I have to be slower to get something.

02:01:41.437 --> 02:01:44.481
COMMENTATOR: A good start
from Jorge Lorenzo yet again!

02:01:44.606 --> 02:01:47.400
He just hooked it up really nicely
as the light went out.

02:01:47.525 --> 02:01:50.569
And look at that!
Pedrosa is past Marquez.

02:01:50.694 --> 02:01:52.946
NARRATOR: Lorenzo had to reckon
with Dani Pedrosa.

02:01:53.071 --> 02:01:57.116
He could derail the plan by doing
what he naturally wanted to do.

02:01:57.241 --> 02:02:01.328
LORENZO: Dani wanted to win the race
and wanted to be as fast as possible.

02:02:01.453 --> 02:02:03.496
PEDROSA: I tried to move forward

02:02:03.621 --> 02:02:07.625
and every time I make a pass
he was ready to pass back.

02:02:08.334 --> 02:02:11.587
COMMENTATOR: Lorenzo fighting back
already! Into turn two!

02:02:11.712 --> 02:02:15.632
He forces Pedrosa wide!
And retakes the lead!

02:02:17.675 --> 02:02:20.219
PEDROSA: I tried to change
my passing points,

02:02:20.344 --> 02:02:22.804
so it was harder for him
to get back on me.

02:02:22.929 --> 02:02:25.681
But he always finds a way.

02:02:26.139 --> 02:02:28.683
COMMENTATOR: Oh, they almost touch
as they come through there.

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:30.810
Pedrosa pushed wide once more
by Lorenzo.

02:02:30.935 --> 02:02:33.437
He just doesn't want to allow
the Honda a moment.

02:02:33.562 --> 02:02:36.856
Again, Marquez was so close
into the back of Pedrosa there.

02:02:38.023 --> 02:02:41.484
Pedrosa is through once more
on Lorenzo, into turn eight.

02:02:41.609 --> 02:02:44.403
And he's actually done it at a place
where it's not easy

02:02:44.528 --> 02:02:47.489
for Lorenzo to get straight back.

02:02:47.614 --> 02:02:49.240
What can Lorenzo respond with?

02:02:49.365 --> 02:02:52.826
Here he comes! He almost takes
Dani Pedrosa's right leg off

02:02:52.951 --> 02:02:55.453
as he comes through turn eleven.

02:02:55.578 --> 02:02:57.246
PEDROSA:
He was way too aggressive.

02:02:57.371 --> 02:03:01.833
My leather at the end was more black
than white from his wheel.

02:03:01.958 --> 02:03:05.044
COMMENTATOR: Oh, he's gonna force
Pedrosa a little bit wide.

02:03:05.169 --> 02:03:06.753
LORENZO: That's not my style.

02:03:06.878 --> 02:03:12.133
I understand that my two actions
were close to the limit.

02:03:12.258 --> 02:03:17.179
In these circumstances I felt a little
bit like David against Goliath.

02:03:17.304 --> 02:03:23.935
I was trying to beat Goliath
doing everything I could do.

02:03:24.977 --> 02:03:27.813
MAN: Lorenzo fights back.
There's no way through that time.

02:03:27.938 --> 02:03:30.815
There is! He's pushed.
He's pushed Dani Pedrosa wide!

02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:33.901
He's pushed him right off the track,
as well. He had to do it.

02:03:34.026 --> 02:03:36.361
And now Marquez takes over
at the front.

02:03:36.486 --> 02:03:40.990
MAN: You had the best view of
the battle between Jorge and Dani.

02:03:42.533 --> 02:03:46.662
How many penalty points do you think
Jorge deserved with the passes?

02:03:46.787 --> 02:03:48.038
(LAUGHS)

02:03:50.081 --> 02:03:54.376
You know, I already said in the past
and I will say now,

02:03:54.501 --> 02:03:59.005
we are here for racing, for fighting
and the races are like that.

02:03:59.130 --> 02:04:02.049
COMMENTATOR: I tell you,
Lorenzo is riding as aggressively

02:04:02.174 --> 02:04:04.593
as I've ever seen him ride.
He has to.

02:04:04.718 --> 02:04:07.595
He will try
and rough up Marquez now at the front.

02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:10.389
And here he comes!
Into turn two this time again.

02:04:10.514 --> 02:04:14.809
He's very strong in there once more.
And he takes the lead from Marquez.

02:04:14.934 --> 02:04:17.186
He's gonna have to try
and slow things up.

02:04:17.311 --> 02:04:20.856
NARRATOR: But the writing was
on the wall for Lorenzo.

02:04:20.981 --> 02:04:23.233
The other riders were falling back.

02:04:23.358 --> 02:04:25.610
LORENZO: The other riders,
apart from our three,

02:04:25.735 --> 02:04:27.903
they were too slow
to stay in the group.

02:04:28.028 --> 02:04:31.489
And when I look behind
and I see that they were too far,

02:04:31.614 --> 02:04:34.366
I thought to win this race,
to go away, and that's it.

02:04:34.491 --> 02:04:37.285
COMMENTATOR: He's definitely changed
the tactics, hasn't he now?

02:04:37.410 --> 02:04:41.455
He's gone from slowing, let's get
everybody involved in the party,

02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:44.291
to let's see
if you can run at my sort of pace.

02:04:44.416 --> 02:04:48.002
Of course, Marquez doesn't need
to be sucked into this.

02:04:48.127 --> 02:04:50.963
MARQUEZ: It was difficult
because something inside me say,

02:04:51.088 --> 02:04:52.714
"You need to fight."

02:04:52.839 --> 02:04:56.717
I understand
that it was much more important,

02:04:56.842 --> 02:04:59.970
the championship than one race.

02:05:01.846 --> 02:05:06.934
COMMENTATOR: Number 93 now has
four kilometers, 2.5 miles left.

02:05:07.059 --> 02:05:11.438
MARQUEZ: That was maybe
the longest race in my career.

02:05:11.563 --> 02:05:14.357
Last lap I was so careful.

02:05:14.482 --> 02:05:18.068
COMMENTATOR: He's gonna win
his debut season in MotoGP.

02:05:20.028 --> 02:05:23.698
But hats off first of all
to Jorge Lorenzo.

02:05:23.823 --> 02:05:26.575
Jorge Lorenzo wins
his eighth grand prix this season.

02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:29.619
But now we await
for the arrival of Marc Marquez!

02:05:29.744 --> 02:05:34.957
He's done it! He's done it!
Twenty years old, 266 days!

02:05:35.082 --> 02:05:37.375
The youngest ever winner
in the premiere class.

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:40.294
The first rookie to do so since '78.

02:06:16.038 --> 02:06:18.999
MARQUEZ: I want to say thanks to Honda.
To all my team.

02:06:19.124 --> 02:06:24.337
To all the people who help me. To my
family because they are always there.

02:06:24.462 --> 02:06:28.674
I don't know what I can say
because I feel so good.

02:06:28.799 --> 02:06:31.551
MAN: Behind that smile there
is the courage of Marquez.

02:06:31.676 --> 02:06:37.431
The courage of one who says,
"I'm here. I'm a kid, but I can win."

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:41.309
ROSSI: So, Marc did
some incredible things.

02:06:41.434 --> 02:06:46.647
I expect he have to do some more
mistakes during the first season.

02:06:46.772 --> 02:06:53.361
He has all the potential
to become the greatest of all time

02:06:53.486 --> 02:06:56.864
or better than me or win more than me.

02:06:56.989 --> 02:07:00.951
He has great skills
and is also very young.

02:07:01.076 --> 02:07:04.162
But now is very early to say.

02:07:04.287 --> 02:07:11.252
It's a long way.
But he has 100% of possibility.

02:07:17.341 --> 02:07:20.469
MARQUEZ'S FATHER: It's as big
as it gets, there's nothing bigger.

02:07:20.594 --> 02:07:23.179
He's won the toughest
championships in the world.

02:07:23.304 --> 02:07:25.848
He's the fastest rider
in the world right now.

02:07:29.393 --> 02:07:35.232
ROSSI: All the riders hope
he's already close to his top level.

02:07:35.357 --> 02:07:39.527
Because if he improves
a lot from here from now,

02:07:39.652 --> 02:07:42.321
for the other guys, it's a big problem.
(LAUGHS)

02:07:43.530 --> 02:07:45.740
MARQUEZ'S FATHER:
He's the same son as always.

02:07:45.865 --> 02:07:48.617
He might be the champion,
but he's the same.

02:07:48.742 --> 02:07:51.077
It's so great.

02:07:51.827 --> 02:07:55.205
MARQUEZ'S FATHER: That's the lovely
thing, the essence of the family.

02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:58.207
At least he hasn't talked
about leaving us yet.

02:08:04.796 --> 02:08:06.839
(DRUMMING)

02:08:08.715 --> 02:08:10.299
(CHEERING)

02:08:51.214 --> 02:08:54.217
DR COSTA: I have been fortunate.

02:08:54.342 --> 02:08:57.261
This is the message.

02:08:57.487 --> 02:09:02.700
In the motorcycle world, anyone
who falls, like Lorenzo or Marquez,

02:09:02.825 --> 02:09:04.326
who races with broken bones,

02:09:04.451 --> 02:09:07.162
demonstrates that one
can come back from injury

02:09:07.287 --> 02:09:11.332
to continue to breathe
the intoxication of a dream.

02:09:11.457 --> 02:09:14.501
It's not so much about reaching a goal,

02:09:14.626 --> 02:09:18.504
it's the challenge, the journey
of becoming ourselves in life.

02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:21.381
We must share the scent of victory

02:09:21.506 --> 02:09:25.259
and make those around us happy
by our example.

02:09:28.845 --> 02:09:33.516
At one point, I used to think
that I'm very unlucky

02:09:33.641 --> 02:09:36.352
if I compare myself
to the other riders.

02:09:36.477 --> 02:09:38.145
Much more often to hospital.

02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:42.857
And much more often
I have Race Direction problems.

02:09:42.982 --> 02:09:48.529
But, you know,
I think now completely different.

02:09:48.654 --> 02:09:52.783
I completely see
that I am a very fortunate guy.

02:09:52.908 --> 02:09:55.785
I live every day the dream of my life.

02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:57.870
There is a very high level
of competition

02:09:57.995 --> 02:10:01.331
and I'm still there
through now eleven years

02:10:01.456 --> 02:10:03.374
and this makes me proud.

02:10:03.499 --> 02:10:07.544
Sure, numbers could be a little better
but I'm enjoying it.

02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:11.172
You have to work it out. I think Rossi,
for example, he's trying also.

02:10:11.297 --> 02:10:15.426
It will never be the same because
in life there is a constant change,

02:10:15.551 --> 02:10:18.512
in you, in the rest, in everything.

02:10:18.637 --> 02:10:21.556
But you have to work out the best

02:10:21.681 --> 02:10:24.475
to find your happiness
and the best balance for you.

02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:30.814
When you go home
and you are at rest and out of this,

02:10:30.939 --> 02:10:32.440
it's not the number that you get.

02:10:32.565 --> 02:10:37.528
It's the experience you felt
when you were doing it.

02:10:39.279 --> 02:10:43.032
My father once told me, when I was 14,

02:10:43.157 --> 02:10:47.286
before I started world championships
in 2002, before my debut.

02:10:48.662 --> 02:10:51.289
I crashed in Montmelo.

02:10:51.414 --> 02:10:57.503
So when my dad see me like this,
unconscious in the ambulance,

02:10:57.628 --> 02:11:00.047
we went to the hospital.

02:11:00.172 --> 02:11:02.299
He told me,

02:11:02.424 --> 02:11:08.179
"Son, let's stop this shit,
because, it's a shit."

02:11:08.304 --> 02:11:12.016
"You know, it isn't worth it."

02:11:12.933 --> 02:11:15.685
But I say...
I was crying at this moment.

02:11:15.810 --> 02:11:20.231
I say,
"No, no, Dad, I will continue."

02:11:21.857 --> 02:11:25.610
ROSSI: Everybody has his way
to interpret racing.

02:11:25.735 --> 02:11:32.366
Some riders do it because
they want revenge on their world.

02:11:32.491 --> 02:11:36.745
Some others, it's very important
to give the maximum.

02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:38.830
For some others it's for fun,

02:11:38.955 --> 02:11:43.876
others because they like
the adrenaline.

02:11:44.001 --> 02:11:47.629
So I think that everybody has his way.

02:11:47.754 --> 02:11:51.048
And all the ways are good. Yeah.

02:11:56.845 --> 02:11:58.263
MAN: Was that 100%?

02:11:58.388 --> 02:12:00.515
Yeah. Maybe a little bit more.

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:02.558
A little bit more, as always.

02:12:08.564 --> 02:12:10.857
We're at Misano,
the Marco Simoncelli circuit.

02:12:13.693 --> 02:12:16.070
DRUDI:
I talk with Paolo many times.

02:12:16.195 --> 02:12:19.323
Ask him to build a team
in the style of Marco Simoncelli.

02:12:19.448 --> 02:12:23.160
Because, he was involved
in the racing life of Marco.

02:12:23.285 --> 02:12:25.203
And he was able to take him to the top.

02:12:25.328 --> 02:12:28.414
He has to find a new energy
to go ahead.

02:12:28.539 --> 02:12:32.251
Not in the memory of Marco,
but in the style, Simoncelli style.

02:12:34.044 --> 02:12:38.173
This is the first year,
but they're doing well.

02:12:38.298 --> 02:12:40.925
We'll see what we can do next year.

02:12:41.050 --> 02:12:43.802
DRUDI: I think having the relation
with the riders, the two riders,

02:12:43.927 --> 02:12:46.930
if one of the two becomes stronger,

02:12:47.055 --> 02:12:52.435
for sure he can jump on the next
category and then jump and jump.

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.852
We will see.

02:12:55.562 --> 02:13:00.567
The circle that was broken in a way
now is complete.

02:13:13.079 --> 02:13:17.124
NARRATOR: Every Sunday,
as night begins to fall on Coriano,

02:13:17.249 --> 02:13:19.209
a flame ignites

02:13:19.334 --> 02:13:25.298
and burns in memory
of Marco Simoncelli for 58 seconds.

02:13:36.183 --> 02:13:39.311
Grand prix motorcycle racing
is the process

02:13:39.436 --> 02:13:42.147
of turning fire into speed.

02:13:42.272 --> 02:13:45.275
The combustion of fuel
and air in the engine

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.944
and the fire in the heart of a rider

02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:50.321
willing to risk everything...

02:13:51.488 --> 02:13:53.156
...to win.

02:15:44.100 --> 02:13:53.156
