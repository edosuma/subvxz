WEBVTT

00:00.973 --> 00:02.526
We've seen fragments before,

00:02.531 --> 00:04.587
enough to confirm that
he kept journals, but

00:04.629 --> 00:06.520
nothing like this. Are they just

00:06.534 --> 00:09.488
fantasies that sustain
him? Or are they a record

00:09.529 --> 00:11.378
of nine more murders?

00:11.400 --> 00:13.052
The police say they have a confession,

00:13.085 --> 00:14.925
that you made a number of admissions.

00:15.387 --> 00:16.608
I... I don't remember any of that.

00:16.608 --> 00:18.739
- I understand he's conscious.
- Yes,

00:19.084 --> 00:21.057
but there is an issue.

00:21.073 --> 00:24.070
It seems Mr Spector
suffered some memory loss.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.094
Are we supposed to be
taking this seriously?

00:26.122 --> 00:27.284
I think we have to.

00:27.307 --> 00:29.928
- Do you know who that is?
- No.

00:29.991 --> 00:32.241
You will be held on remand in hospital

00:32.253 --> 00:33.909
until arrangements can be made

00:33.918 --> 00:37.405
to transfer you to a
secure psychiatric clinic.

00:37.525 --> 00:38.779
If she told the truth

00:38.823 --> 00:41.103
in the first place, about
Spector's whereabouts,

00:41.125 --> 00:43.381
then perhaps Rose Stagg would
not have been put through

00:43.392 --> 00:44.818
the ordeal that she has.

00:44.938 --> 00:46.022
Drink it all up.

00:47.678 --> 00:48.824
Good girl.

00:48.824 --> 00:50.531
Why are you so kind to me?

00:50.651 --> 00:53.227
If I've done the things
that the police say I've done

00:53.255 --> 00:54.566
then I'm a monster.

00:54.589 --> 00:55.676
It's my job.

00:55.873 --> 00:58.013
He's just the sort of
person who would feign

00:58.035 --> 01:00.643
amnesia if he felt that there was
something to be gained from it,

01:00.687 --> 01:04.299
<i>even for the sheer delight of
duping people, particularly experts.</i>

01:04.419 --> 01:06.717
Someone like me, for example.

01:10.176 --> 01:12.048
I found a murder that looks promising.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.889
Law student, Susan Harper.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.724
The only problem is, there
is someone doing time for it.

01:18.063 --> 01:19.320
I'll pray for you.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:11.051 --> 03:12.805
Rise and shine.

03:21.109 --> 03:22.772
Time to get up.

03:26.797 --> 03:28.509
Stella, for star.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.043
Five more minutes, Daddy, please.

05:16.609 --> 05:18.813
There are no scratches or nail marks

05:18.840 --> 05:21.014
on the soft parts of the victim's face,

05:21.014 --> 05:22.619
no bruising or

05:22.925 --> 05:24.926
lacerations to the mouth or nose

05:24.947 --> 05:27.400
to suggest they were
held closed by a hand.

05:28.150 --> 05:30.957
The original case file
suggests that David Alvarez

05:30.963 --> 05:32.930
suffocated her using a pillow.

05:33.201 --> 05:35.418
There was no saliva,
blood or tissue cells

05:35.432 --> 05:37.004
on any of the pillows, were there?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.487
They could have been washed.

05:39.399 --> 05:40.726
Yes, they could.

05:43.262 --> 05:45.146
Do we have the toxicology report?

05:45.167 --> 05:46.618
Page five, Ma'am.

05:50.107 --> 05:51.719
When was the report done?

05:51.839 --> 05:54.325
Susan Harper's body was
found cool to the touch

05:54.332 --> 05:55.652
on a Monday morning.

05:55.773 --> 05:59.404
Toxicology was 24 hours
later, during autopsy.

05:59.613 --> 06:02.768
Tests 24 hours after
that on the Wednesday.

06:03.157 --> 06:04.414
Based on these figures,

06:04.438 --> 06:07.235
I'd say the victim took
cocaine within hours,

06:07.535 --> 06:09.741
minutes, even, from death.

06:11.347 --> 06:13.505
Do we have anything at all to put

06:13.811 --> 06:17.536
Paul Spector or Peter
Baldwin in London in 2002?

06:18.028 --> 06:19.546
Nothing as yet, Ma'am.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.320
Was there a plastic
bag found at the scene?

06:30.838 --> 06:32.382
No mention that I've seen.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.876
Well, Spector is due to be moved today,

06:40.876 --> 06:43.585
which means the next

06:44.123 --> 06:46.574
part of his assessment
is about to begin.

06:48.559 --> 06:51.411
We have to keep believing
that it will go to trial...

06:52.612 --> 06:54.646
... and when it does,
we have to put together

06:54.652 --> 06:57.810
as strong an evidential case
to the PPS as we possibly can.

07:00.338 --> 07:01.801
We have to be ready.

07:03.803 --> 07:06.040
The truth of a confession is immaterial.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.644
What is of crucial importance is

07:07.660 --> 07:09.223
how the confession was obtained,

07:09.245 --> 07:10.957
not whether or not it's true.

07:11.513 --> 07:13.180
The court must exclude the confession

07:13.185 --> 07:15.097
if it finds it was
obtained by oppression

07:15.217 --> 07:18.211
or under circumstances likely
to render it unreliable.

07:18.233 --> 07:19.706
I've read the transcripts.

07:19.745 --> 07:22.674
- I didn't see any signs of oppression.
- I'm not so sure.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.593
The circumstances are certainly unusual.

07:26.178 --> 07:29.217
Why is a Superintendent doing the
job of a Constable or Sergeant,

07:29.239 --> 07:30.785
interviewing a suspect?

07:31.091 --> 07:33.203
Surely, when you get to
her level, you supervise,

07:33.207 --> 07:35.744
manage and direct the
officers, not do their job?

07:35.811 --> 07:37.121
It was at his request,

07:37.132 --> 07:39.578
- "Just you, Stella, no-one else."
- That's my point.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.509
She didn't really use any
standard interview techniques.

07:44.042 --> 07:46.321
She didn't offer psychological excuses

07:46.344 --> 07:49.154
or minimise the seriousness
of Spector's crimes.

07:49.274 --> 07:50.946
She didn't praise or flatter.

07:51.066 --> 07:52.893
She even used leading questions

07:52.898 --> 07:55.094
that elicited one-word answers.

07:55.660 --> 07:57.994
Almost not like a
police interview at all,

07:58.530 --> 08:00.519
more like an intimate conversation.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.498
She didn't need to establish a rapport,

08:03.731 --> 08:06.101
because their relationship
had already been established

08:06.117 --> 08:07.212
on the phone.

08:07.332 --> 08:08.909
While they were still hunting him,

08:08.909 --> 08:11.797
it's claimed Spector and Gibson
had private conversations.

08:12.437 --> 08:14.834
She gave him her personal phone number.

08:16.362 --> 08:19.202
They even suggest he
was in her hotel room.

08:20.598 --> 08:22.410
Why would he do something so risky

08:22.421 --> 08:24.105
just to leave an entry in her diary?

08:24.294 --> 08:26.262
It speaks of a kind of obsession.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.826
<i>Stella?</i>

08:33.695 --> 08:34.984
<i>Yes.</i>

08:36.178 --> 08:38.485
<i>How nice to hear your voice again.</i>

08:40.780 --> 08:42.070
<i>Is that you, Peter?</i>

08:42.993 --> 08:44.010
<i>Yes.</i>

08:45.372 --> 08:46.917
<i>Why are you calling me?</i>

08:48.819 --> 08:51.059
<i>Because I'm looking up at the sky.</i>

08:52.276 --> 08:53.389
<i>Stella.</i>

08:53.605 --> 08:55.350
Shining star.

08:57.335 --> 08:58.818
<i>It's a beautiful night.</i>

08:59.224 --> 09:00.853
<i>Made me think of you.</i>

09:02.737 --> 09:04.955
Do we have that diary, that entry?

09:04.966 --> 09:06.806
It hasn't been disclosed so far.

09:06.989 --> 09:08.274
Get it.

09:09.197 --> 09:10.526
So...

09:11.599 --> 09:14.836
- ... she seduced a confession from him?
- Maybe.

09:15.559 --> 09:17.099
If you can support
what you're suggesting

09:17.115 --> 09:18.822
with case law, legal principals,

09:19.446 --> 09:21.107
I might include it in the brief.

09:43.763 --> 09:46.503
These are all of the books
from Spector's lock-up, Ma'am.

10:37.813 --> 10:39.020
Ma'am,

10:39.198 --> 10:40.816
there's something you should see.

10:42.407 --> 10:46.347
The wife of the man the police
claim is The Belfast Strangler

10:46.408 --> 10:49.643
was involved in a bizarre
incident earlier this morning,

10:49.677 --> 10:53.011
<i>captured on video by a
passer-by as it unfolded.</i>

10:53.029 --> 10:56.275
Images that some viewers
may find disturbing.

10:57.113 --> 10:58.835
<i>Oh, my God, that's a car. </i>

10:58.863 --> 11:01.110
<i>- Hey, hey!
- Michael, be careful!</i>

11:03.256 --> 11:06.010
Hey, hey!

11:06.012 --> 11:07.497
Oh, my God.

11:08.097 --> 11:10.807
The car being engulfed
by the incoming tide

11:10.877 --> 11:13.945
belongs to Sally-Ann Spector, 32.

11:13.967 --> 11:16.636
The windows are raised,
the doors are locked.

11:16.874 --> 11:18.933
Inside are her two children.

11:18.935 --> 11:20.720
<i>- Oh, my God!
- The girl, aged eight,</i>

11:20.748 --> 11:22.422
can be heard calling for help.

11:22.978 --> 11:25.031
- <i>Help us, please, help!
- </i> The lock.

11:25.196 --> 11:27.487
- Hey, hey!
- I can't wake up Liam!

11:28.394 --> 11:29.839
<i>Please, get it open!</i>

11:30.485 --> 11:32.000
<i>Michael!</i>

11:32.004 --> 11:33.519
Mummy!

11:34.925 --> 11:37.493
At last, it seems the doors are unlocked

11:37.528 --> 11:41.202
and the two children are lifted
clear and carried to safety.

11:41.885 --> 11:43.960
In the background, Sally-Ann Spector

11:43.988 --> 11:45.756
can be seen walking unsteadily

11:45.762 --> 11:47.835
away from the car through the shallows.

11:48.808 --> 11:49.982
<i>Over here. </i>

11:50.748 --> 11:52.283
<i>Are you all right? </i>

11:52.305 --> 11:53.320
<i>She's so cold.</i>

11:54.066 --> 11:57.352
A moment later, the car
is almost washed away.

11:57.357 --> 11:58.542
<i>Somebody help that woman!</i>

12:03.333 --> 12:06.162
The family was airlifted
by police helicopter

12:06.184 --> 12:08.212
to the Belfast General Hospital,

12:08.257 --> 12:11.259
where Paul Spector is being
treated for gunshot wounds

12:11.293 --> 12:13.479
he sustained in Police cust...

12:17.554 --> 12:19.812
How were we to know
she was that desperate?

12:25.342 --> 12:27.883
It's what women do
with their anger, Jim.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.645
They harm themselves

12:31.262 --> 12:33.675
or extensions of
themselves, their children.

12:37.827 --> 12:39.434
What frame of mind must she have been in

12:39.451 --> 12:41.880
to think that they were
all better off dead?

12:43.558 --> 12:46.071
Instead of caring for her,

12:46.237 --> 12:48.273
supporting her, all we could do

12:48.289 --> 12:50.035
was drag her through the courts and

12:50.445 --> 12:51.952
threaten her with prison.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.642
It wasn't just down to me.

12:54.821 --> 12:57.472
The DPP was of a similar mind.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.045
Yeah.

13:01.102 --> 13:02.692
Well, now you can add attempted murder

13:02.692 --> 13:04.325
to her list of charges.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.797
All I ever wanted to do

13:10.815 --> 13:13.487
was keep those children
safe, Stella, that's all!

13:20.797 --> 13:21.892
Healy.

13:23.918 --> 13:25.110
Right,

13:25.867 --> 13:27.223
thanks for letting me know.

13:27.485 --> 13:29.531
Spector's wife and children
have been taken to the General.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.136
- Why?
- It's been on the news.

13:31.164 --> 13:32.915
See if you can find it on your phone.

14:35.772 --> 14:38.692
Point of care testing found
benzos in the girl's urine.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.448
We haven't managed a
sample from the other two.

14:40.504 --> 14:44.017
The son, Liam, is GCS. 12, 13.

14:44.137 --> 14:46.146
With stimulation, he's rousable.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.330
Check the summary care record.

14:56.601 --> 14:58.403
I see she's on the blues.

14:58.937 --> 15:01.171
Severe anxiety and insomnia.

15:01.232 --> 15:04.306
Five milligrams TDS,
titrating to a maximum of ten,

15:04.646 --> 15:06.130
review after two weeks.

15:06.163 --> 15:08.142
So the mother fed the
kids the anxiolytics

15:08.148 --> 15:09.654
and then drove them to the sea.

15:10.093 --> 15:11.432
Looks like it.

15:11.927 --> 15:13.451
She's unresponsive,

15:13.571 --> 15:14.891
not saying anything.

15:26.313 --> 15:28.081
Pupils are mid-sized and reactive.

15:28.092 --> 15:30.365
- How's his blood glucose?
- Normal.

15:30.649 --> 15:32.127
He might need Flumazenil.

15:32.149 --> 15:35.467
Let's put him into paediatric
ICU to keep an eye on him.

15:56.441 --> 15:58.791
Right now, she's
conscious but not talking.

15:58.819 --> 16:01.693
I don't think she's fit
for psych evaluation yet.

16:02.249 --> 16:05.100
We're moving the boy up to the kids ICU.

16:05.105 --> 16:07.585
The girl is awake, she seems OK.

16:08.813 --> 16:10.768
Have you seen the newsreel footage?

16:10.888 --> 16:12.014
No.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.599
It looks like a deliberate attempt

16:13.610 --> 16:15.323
to kill herself and her children.

16:16.723 --> 16:18.103
A cry for help?

16:19.341 --> 16:20.636
Maybe.

16:22.423 --> 16:24.535
- Can I say hello?
- Sure.

16:33.286 --> 16:34.707
Hello, Olivia.

16:36.853 --> 16:38.143
Do you remember me?

16:42.111 --> 16:43.545
How are you feeling?

17:04.892 --> 17:08.067
The bullet fragments in Mr
Spector's body contained no iron,

17:08.186 --> 17:10.016
so he had the MRI scan this morning.

17:13.114 --> 17:16.711
There's an absence of evidence
for established infarct...

17:17.717 --> 17:21.696
... but a suggestion here

17:22.075 --> 17:24.844
of a loss of grey white
matter differentiation.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.424
Now that may be in keeping
with ischaemic insult

17:27.424 --> 17:29.663
in the frontal temporal lobe region,

17:30.426 --> 17:33.522
but I can't say it
explains the memory loss.

17:35.589 --> 17:37.513
I'll pass the results on to Dr Larson

17:37.529 --> 17:39.001
and he can include
them in his assessment.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.876
Do we know what happened
to his wife and children?

17:40.937 --> 17:43.477
- How are they?
- No serious injury, I think,

17:43.597 --> 17:46.229
but I'm awaiting a call
from the ED Consultant.

17:46.529 --> 17:49.375
- Has Mr Spector been informed?
- Not yet.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.492
I'm going to wait for
further information.

18:04.006 --> 18:06.669
I think we have to make a
holding statement of some sort.

18:06.847 --> 18:08.037
Definitely.

18:08.871 --> 18:10.955
Everyone will have seen it by now.

18:12.423 --> 18:13.541
Let's...

18:14.285 --> 18:16.366
confirm that an incident happened,

18:16.366 --> 18:18.471
identify the individuals involved.

18:20.473 --> 18:22.157
Oh, there's nothing else,

18:22.541 --> 18:24.825
no speculation about motivation.

18:25.047 --> 18:27.064
The press will do that for us.

18:27.126 --> 18:28.389
Yeah.

18:30.717 --> 18:32.433
Will you handle this, please, Matt?

18:34.057 --> 18:36.833
I'll sit down with DCI
Eastwood and work something out.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.561
Sound a warning to the press.

18:40.723 --> 18:42.101
And, Matt...

18:44.575 --> 18:46.142
Show a human face.

19:03.499 --> 19:05.633
<i>Paul, the police claim your</i>

19:05.639 --> 19:08.011
fingerprints are on a
pair of decorating shears.

19:08.536 --> 19:11.392
They say the shears, the scissors,

19:11.719 --> 19:14.726
tested positive for Joe
Brawley's DNA, a blood sample.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.312
They were retrieved from the water...

19:17.738 --> 19:18.875
here.

19:21.740 --> 19:22.952
I know where that is,

19:23.073 --> 19:24.597
I go running there sometimes.

19:24.608 --> 19:26.894
Is it possible you
came across the scissors

19:26.928 --> 19:29.439
while you were running,
considered them dangerous,

19:29.493 --> 19:30.902
picked them up and

19:31.197 --> 19:33.420
threw them into the
water, out of harm's way?

19:34.849 --> 19:36.785
I don't remember any scissors.

19:38.868 --> 19:42.154
The one real eye witness is
his sister, Annie Brawley.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.737
After the attack and
before you were arrested

19:44.738 --> 19:46.442
you went to see her in hospital.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.418
I did? Why?

19:48.538 --> 19:50.569
She was grieving the
death of her brother.

19:51.236 --> 19:53.088
You were employed by
the Alice Monroe Fund

19:53.088 --> 19:55.172
to offer her support, counselling.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.696
- What happened?
- Nothing.

19:57.918 --> 19:59.163
You talked.

19:59.185 --> 20:00.709
She said you were helpful.

20:06.017 --> 20:07.391
Hold on. I'm, er,

20:08.041 --> 20:10.225
sorry, I'm very confused here.

20:10.897 --> 20:13.311
This is someone the
police say that I attacked?

20:13.372 --> 20:14.528
Yes.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.595
Well, why didn't she recognise me?

20:16.990 --> 20:18.458
I don't know.

20:20.359 --> 20:23.706
Why would I go and visit
someone that I'd attacked?

20:24.623 --> 20:27.103
What if she recognised me,
what if she started screaming?

20:30.598 --> 20:32.083
It doesn't make sense.

21:00.401 --> 21:03.036
You do have alibis
for all of the murders.

21:03.431 --> 21:05.236
They have been provided by an individual

21:05.258 --> 21:07.120
called Katie Benedetto.

21:08.299 --> 21:11.224
She claims she had a sexual
relationship with you.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.599
I don't know her. What age is she?

21:17.762 --> 21:19.680
She's just turned 16.

21:19.924 --> 21:22.687
She says she was 14 when
you first slept together.

21:23.021 --> 21:24.534
That's not possible.

21:25.429 --> 21:27.362
A child? That's not possible.

21:27.395 --> 21:30.259
There are doubts about her
credibility as a witness.

21:30.670 --> 21:34.216
The real issue, Mr
Spector, is the confession.

21:35.073 --> 21:36.657
I think you should hear a little

21:36.702 --> 21:38.675
of the recording that was made.

21:38.936 --> 21:40.921
It might jog your memory.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.653
<i>Tell me about the first time.</i>

21:50.270 --> 21:51.700
<i>What was it like?</i>

21:56.134 --> 21:57.831
<i>It made me sick.</i>

22:00.617 --> 22:02.318
<i>The smell disgusted me.</i>

22:04.435 --> 22:07.631
<i>The first was the worst
and hardest to get over,</i>

22:07.751 --> 22:09.481
<i>but a switch had been flicked,</i>

22:10.232 --> 22:12.022
<i>a line crossed.</i>

22:12.912 --> 22:15.541
<i>Something was done that
couldn't be undone.</i>

22:16.714 --> 22:19.789
<i>Something that separates
you from the common herd.</i>

22:21.706 --> 22:23.956
<i>I was ill for four days after.</i>

22:25.835 --> 22:28.481
<i>You're in a state of
existential shock... </i>

22:30.647 --> 22:32.589
<i>... but then you find
yourself unchallenged</i>

22:32.595 --> 22:34.779
<i>by divine and secular power.</i>

22:35.296 --> 22:36.703
<i>OK.</i>

22:37.608 --> 22:39.309
<i>So why not do it again... </i>

22:40.227 --> 22:41.467
<i>... but better?</i>

22:43.750 --> 22:45.353
<i>Tell me, do you speak to them?</i>

22:45.876 --> 22:48.049
<i>To the women that you torture and kill?</i>

22:50.584 --> 22:51.679
<i>No.</i>

22:53.352 --> 22:55.090
<i>Do they die slowly?</i>

22:57.527 --> 22:58.889
<i>Yes.</i>

22:59.568 --> 23:02.347
<i>Loosening and tightening your
grip around their throat?</i>

23:03.487 --> 23:06.288
<i>Keeping them suspended
between life and death?</i>

23:07.645 --> 23:09.001
<i>Yes.</i>

23:10.164 --> 23:11.839
<i>Binding them first?</i>

23:12.647 --> 23:14.043
<i>Yes.</i>

23:14.871 --> 23:16.848
<i>How long do you torture them?</i>

23:17.735 --> 23:20.294
- <i>Stop it. Please, stop it.
- </i> Do you inflict sexual acts...

23:24.011 --> 23:25.727
That can't be me talking.

23:26.547 --> 23:29.269
How would I forget something
like that? That can't be me.

23:30.619 --> 23:33.509
There are other recordings, Mr Spector.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.416
These are video recordings.

23:36.846 --> 23:39.947
The prosecution suggest that...

23:40.620 --> 23:42.282
they were found on your phone.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.316
That you made them.

23:44.761 --> 23:47.046
- That's Rose.
- Yes.

23:50.785 --> 23:52.625
You want to be noticed.

23:54.639 --> 23:56.786
You want to be paid attention to,

23:56.800 --> 23:58.378
make your mark?

24:00.302 --> 24:02.386
Fine. Hurt me,

24:02.894 --> 24:04.804
do whatever you want to me.

24:05.701 --> 24:07.111
Do your worst.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.848
Nothing you can do

24:08.869 --> 24:12.156
will ever take away how
much I love my husband,

24:12.850 --> 24:15.268
how much I love my children.

24:16.859 --> 24:18.270
Nothing you can do

24:18.291 --> 24:20.507
can make me devalue my life in any way.

24:20.514 --> 24:22.181
I will celebrate life.

24:22.441 --> 24:24.752
I love and I am loved

24:24.780 --> 24:26.704
and nothing that you...

24:31.819 --> 24:33.982
<i>Why the fuck are you watching this?</i>

24:35.091 --> 24:37.010
<i>You sick shit.</i>

24:38.142 --> 24:40.153
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

24:48.523 --> 24:49.725
Nurse!

24:51.671 --> 24:53.026
Nurse!

24:54.256 --> 24:57.382
Paul, Paul, stop that. Can
you step outside, please?

24:57.660 --> 24:59.112
Paul, that's enough,

24:59.174 --> 25:00.628
Paul, focus on your breathing,

25:00.648 --> 25:03.031
focus on your breath.
Come on, that's enough.

25:03.087 --> 25:04.496
Just in and out.

25:04.539 --> 25:06.581
Slow breathing, you're OK, Paul.

25:06.702 --> 25:08.625
In and out, big, deep breath.

25:08.876 --> 25:13.162
Yeah that's good, that's it, you're OK.

25:29.036 --> 25:31.290
Jesus, what have we got ourselves into?

25:31.293 --> 25:33.209
- You having doubts?
- No.

25:33.225 --> 25:34.647
- You sure?
- Yes.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.328
Because if you are, you
can pack up your briefcase

25:36.342 --> 25:38.205
- and sell houses instead.
- I'm not.

25:39.139 --> 25:40.482
Are you Sean Healy?

25:40.698 --> 25:41.705
Yes.

25:42.238 --> 25:43.510
Will you give this to Paul for me?

25:43.510 --> 25:44.471
Katie?

25:44.591 --> 25:45.836
Please, just give this to Paul.

25:45.849 --> 25:47.628
Katie, you're in breach
of your bail conditions.

25:47.642 --> 25:48.913
You're in serious trouble.

25:49.077 --> 25:50.563
We can't take that letter from you.

25:58.158 --> 25:59.448
Katie, stop!

26:01.244 --> 26:02.320
Katie!

26:02.863 --> 26:05.833
I can confirm that there
has been a serious incident

26:05.846 --> 26:08.033
involving the wife and the two children

26:08.056 --> 26:09.781
of the defendant, Paul Spector.

26:09.826 --> 26:11.693
All three are currently being treated

26:11.707 --> 26:13.169
in the Belfast General Hospital.

26:13.289 --> 26:14.824
Their injuries are not life-threatening.

26:14.890 --> 26:17.438
In light of the torrent of publicity

26:17.474 --> 26:19.605
since Paul Spector was
arrested and charged,

26:19.773 --> 26:21.201
the Police Service Northern Ireland

26:21.232 --> 26:24.413
feel bound to urge the
media to exercise restraint

26:24.493 --> 26:28.228
and caution in reporting
the details of this case.

26:49.637 --> 26:50.674
Yep.

26:50.941 --> 26:53.925
We've had a request to
disclose your dream diary.

26:54.716 --> 26:57.274
Sean Healy wants his
own handwriting expert

26:57.291 --> 26:59.336
to examine the entry Spector made.

27:02.431 --> 27:03.863
He's in hospital,

27:04.924 --> 27:06.487
he's incapacitated...

27:07.541 --> 27:09.381
... and yet he's still
infecting the lives

27:09.399 --> 27:11.579
of every person he
comes into contact with.

27:13.942 --> 27:17.228
Everyone who fucking crosses his path.

27:23.666 --> 27:25.079
He's a contagion.

27:29.927 --> 27:32.030
Shall I just let them see that page?

27:37.246 --> 27:39.799
They'll just come back
asking for the rest.

27:43.631 --> 27:44.691
No.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.745
Clear it with the PPS.

27:48.888 --> 27:50.973
And if they agree, send all of it.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.364
<i>I can't believe that
she would harm Livvy.</i>

28:00.561 --> 28:02.224
I just don't think she could do that.

28:05.969 --> 28:07.374
I can picture Sally,

28:08.668 --> 28:09.700
nursing her.

28:10.461 --> 28:11.355
Just...

28:11.985 --> 28:13.764
Just so blissfully happy.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.173
She'd never hurt her.

28:19.630 --> 28:21.454
Where are you in that picture?

28:23.682 --> 28:24.998
Where I always am.

28:27.003 --> 28:28.790
On the outside, looking in.

28:32.105 --> 28:33.468
When I was unconscious,

28:34.825 --> 28:35.799
I was...

28:37.560 --> 28:39.508
I... I could see myself.

28:41.327 --> 28:42.995
In this room. I was able to

28:43.761 --> 28:45.402
see myself from above,

28:45.522 --> 28:46.810
lying in the bed,

28:47.633 --> 28:49.394
with all the tubes and monitors.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.779
Have you ever experienced
anything like that before?

28:54.825 --> 28:56.759
Being outside of your body like that?

29:00.300 --> 29:01.767
When I was young, yes.

29:02.889 --> 29:04.628
When things got really bad, I

29:05.985 --> 29:08.207
used to be able to split myself.

29:10.506 --> 29:11.601
If I was lucky,

29:11.637 --> 29:13.273
a part of me would just drift away.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.849
To another place, a...

29:17.662 --> 29:18.859
better place.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.866
Have you thought any more
about what death means to you?

29:27.811 --> 29:29.824
What I think can only disappoint you.

29:31.119 --> 29:32.342
That doesn't matter.

29:38.096 --> 29:39.612
I think that,

29:40.510 --> 29:41.876
just as I didn't

29:41.929 --> 29:43.788
exist before I was born...

29:45.220 --> 29:47.733
... I simply won't exist after I die.

29:50.044 --> 29:51.437
I can't agree.

30:00.678 --> 30:01.718
Do you believe

30:01.731 --> 30:03.946
that you did the
things they say you did?

30:06.516 --> 30:07.735
Do you?

30:12.812 --> 30:14.943
If I did, then I wasn't arrested...

30:16.811 --> 30:18.219
... I was rescued.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.754
I need you to go to London.

30:26.585 --> 30:29.146
My boss at the Met, a
man called Chris George,

30:29.448 --> 30:31.018
Chief Superintendent.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.156
I just spoke to him.

30:33.406 --> 30:35.634
He's agreed to sign the
authorisations you will need

30:35.643 --> 30:37.658
to access the Susan Harper files.

30:37.835 --> 30:39.546
He's agreed to reopen the case?

30:39.792 --> 30:42.381
He's agreed to let us look at the files.

30:42.736 --> 30:44.226
There's a flight leaving Belfast City

30:44.226 --> 30:45.569
in just over an hour.

30:50.795 --> 30:52.386
Will your arm be all right?

30:55.166 --> 30:56.242
Yeah.

30:59.301 --> 31:00.408
Take Ferrington.

31:02.836 --> 31:04.362
These notes cover wound care

31:04.370 --> 31:05.767
and list the medications you're on.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.791
You've had four days of
broad intravenous antibiotics,

31:09.089 --> 31:11.806
but I must remind you, because
of the loss of your spleen,

31:11.841 --> 31:14.678
you will be on lifelong
prophylactic antibiotics.

31:17.786 --> 31:19.676
Is there any chance I could see my son

31:20.854 --> 31:21.899
before I go?

31:36.814 --> 31:37.921
Which one is he?

31:39.011 --> 31:40.123
Just there.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.376
Do you remember him?

32:16.481 --> 32:17.985
Do you think he looks like me?

32:20.616 --> 32:22.182
A little bit, maybe.

32:25.650 --> 32:26.727
Paul.

32:44.950 --> 32:46.009
I can walk.

32:47.467 --> 32:48.801
Hospital policy.

32:50.856 --> 32:52.025
Sit in the chair.

33:10.863 --> 33:12.486
Thank you for everything.

34:22.972 --> 34:24.427
Detective Superintendent Gibson.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.184
I'm here to see Dr Larson.

34:26.304 --> 34:27.456
He's been expecting you.

34:27.493 --> 34:28.842
Please sign in.

34:33.914 --> 34:34.929
Thank you.

34:39.420 --> 34:41.289
Have I seen you somewhere before?

34:46.661 --> 34:48.094
You tell me.

34:55.389 --> 34:56.389
This is Foyle One,

34:56.411 --> 34:58.798
where Mr Spector will be housed.

34:59.154 --> 35:00.634
Doors are kept locked,

35:00.647 --> 35:03.412
all areas are monitored by CCTV.

35:04.921 --> 35:07.765
Staff have lockers here
for personal belongings.

35:08.351 --> 35:10.974
You can leave your mobile
phone, any keys here.

35:14.898 --> 35:17.147
What level of supervision
have you set for Spector?

35:17.502 --> 35:20.401
We have agreed to level
two care for Mr Spector:

35:20.405 --> 35:22.347
continual presence of nursing staff,

35:22.396 --> 35:24.313
but privacy granted for bathing.

35:25.272 --> 35:29.278
All patients in Foyle One
are allocated a primary nurse.

35:29.598 --> 35:31.085
- Male?
- Male.

35:31.835 --> 35:33.374
How many beds are on this ward?

35:33.392 --> 35:34.776
12 in all.

35:35.721 --> 35:38.675
All the patients we have
on the ward at present have

35:38.698 --> 35:41.099
access to their rooms at all times,

35:41.117 --> 35:42.869
except when they're being cleaned.

35:43.361 --> 35:44.736
Some patients have keys

35:44.737 --> 35:46.237
to lock their bedroom doors,

35:46.238 --> 35:48.655
but staff carry override keys.

35:49.821 --> 35:51.033
This way, please.

35:56.012 --> 35:58.155
Most of the patients are on

35:58.173 --> 36:00.046
pharmacological therapy.

36:00.579 --> 36:04.119
We'll assess the need for a
drug strategy for Mr Spector.

36:04.665 --> 36:06.201
Care and treatment is provided

36:06.236 --> 36:07.981
by a multidisciplinary team,

36:08.349 --> 36:10.997
but I will do the legal assessments.

36:12.684 --> 36:14.530
Yeah, Mr Spector is here now.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.963
- There's coffee here, please help yourself.
- Thank you.

36:18.084 --> 36:19.646
I'm going to greet him.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.727
Mr Spector,

37:12.188 --> 37:13.905
I'm August Larson,

37:14.526 --> 37:16.128
the lead clinician here.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.762
Follow me, please.

37:46.730 --> 37:49.212
Nurse Ritchie will orientate you.

37:50.327 --> 37:53.082
I will be along to talk
to you in a little while.

37:54.121 --> 37:55.623
Follow me, Paul.

38:10.341 --> 38:12.448
There's some toiletries for you there.

38:12.476 --> 38:15.409
And that's your information
on ward routines,

38:15.437 --> 38:17.281
policies and procedures.

38:22.322 --> 38:23.491
Are you hungry?

38:24.765 --> 38:26.371
I haven't been eating much.

38:27.170 --> 38:28.515
I'd like some water.

38:28.998 --> 38:30.169
I'll get you some.

38:47.953 --> 38:49.535
Do you have time to talk?

38:49.596 --> 38:50.776
Yes.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.199
Have a seat, please.

38:53.178 --> 38:54.719
Actually I...

38:56.424 --> 38:58.697
- I have some things I want to show you.
- Hmm?

39:26.638 --> 39:29.224
And you're certain these are his work?

39:30.256 --> 39:31.526
Yes.

39:39.996 --> 39:41.459
Is this his poem?

39:42.187 --> 39:43.525
I think so.

39:45.870 --> 39:47.776
"Dark voices tonight...

39:48.789 --> 39:51.615
... foreign ladies
talking to dangerous men.

39:52.467 --> 39:54.933
Their eyes are lunar divisions.

39:55.755 --> 39:57.532
They lie on dead sheets.

39:58.856 --> 40:01.446
A drunken midnight approach.

40:02.870 --> 40:05.633
Her smile is a crooked lamplight.

40:06.416 --> 40:08.207
Red lips parting...

40:09.611 --> 40:12.434
... soft vowels begging...

40:12.800 --> 40:14.596
feeding the night."

40:20.681 --> 40:22.484
Some clean clothes for you.

40:37.872 --> 40:39.394
Is this his, too?

40:40.495 --> 40:42.230
"I don't believe in love.

40:43.179 --> 40:46.441
At least, I believe in love, but not

40:46.562 --> 40:48.078
in happiness.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.241
The only love that lasts

40:51.562 --> 40:53.443
is unhappy love."

40:53.564 --> 40:55.883
Again, I think it must be him.

40:57.287 --> 41:00.126
I haven't found either
on an internet search.

41:01.580 --> 41:04.530
There are some things in
there that are new to me.

41:05.878 --> 41:08.158
He writes at one point about

41:08.640 --> 41:10.331
the battle, as he perceives it,

41:10.342 --> 41:12.256
between "good Paul" and "bad Paul".

41:14.154 --> 41:15.546
He describes

41:16.393 --> 41:19.661
standing back, being a
spectator of his own actions,

41:19.700 --> 41:23.648
that there's an observing
self and a participating self.

41:33.017 --> 41:36.202
There is a dazzling
array of perversions.

41:37.311 --> 41:39.840
I mean, beyond the sadism and the

41:40.268 --> 41:44.133
overwhelming fetishism
with female underwear.

41:44.572 --> 41:46.319
He was a voyeur,

41:46.525 --> 41:48.372
a transvestite...

41:48.821 --> 41:51.728
into autoeroticism and necrophilia.

41:52.088 --> 41:53.986
There's also signs of

41:53.992 --> 41:57.591
pygmalionism, his obsession
with mannequins and dolls.

41:58.783 --> 42:01.113
I've sometimes wondered if he

42:01.884 --> 42:03.464
breathed air

42:03.703 --> 42:06.636
into his dying victims
to prolong their lives...

42:07.612 --> 42:11.373
... so that they could see clearly
that he was going to kill them.

42:20.259 --> 42:23.099
When young children are abused,

42:23.716 --> 42:26.665
they experience fear and anxiety.

42:27.004 --> 42:30.276
They then attempt to
contain those feelings

42:30.632 --> 42:32.628
by acting out sadistically.

42:33.238 --> 42:35.624
If a person is able to do to others

42:35.635 --> 42:37.587
what he fears may be done to him,

42:38.065 --> 42:39.988
he may no longer be afraid.

42:42.422 --> 42:44.266
You assume he was abused?

42:46.158 --> 42:48.121
He was in Gortnacull, I think?

42:49.419 --> 42:52.198
Doctor, I understand that

42:52.243 --> 42:54.128
for you he's a patient,

42:54.156 --> 42:55.560
an abused child,

42:56.114 --> 42:59.464
someone who deserves understanding and

42:59.525 --> 43:01.017
compassion, even.

43:03.390 --> 43:04.959
But to me, he's a...

43:05.080 --> 43:06.874
He's a sexual predator,

43:07.572 --> 43:10.656
and it's my job to protect
the potential victims

43:11.144 --> 43:13.235
from the threat that he poses.

43:19.959 --> 43:23.315
Viewed from a psychodynamic perspective,

43:23.434 --> 43:26.592
even the most apparently insane violence

43:26.803 --> 43:29.837
has meaning in the mind of
the person who commits it.

43:30.736 --> 43:33.221
I have to try to understand that meaning

43:33.221 --> 43:34.707
and learn from it

43:34.828 --> 43:38.412
in the attempt to
prevent further violence.

43:39.006 --> 43:40.343
Yeah.

43:42.258 --> 43:43.466
Just...

43:43.654 --> 43:45.755
don't underestimate the threat...

43:46.734 --> 43:49.396
... the danger that
Paul Spector represents.

43:49.516 --> 43:51.065
I won't.

44:02.059 --> 44:03.513
Do you have an idea

44:03.529 --> 44:05.918
about Mr Spector's pre-morbid IQ?

44:06.663 --> 44:08.798
He was tested as a child

44:09.403 --> 44:12.580
and scored in the very
superior intelligence band.

44:14.149 --> 44:15.359
Thank you.

44:15.731 --> 44:17.610
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

44:30.091 --> 44:33.751
Psychiatry needs feedback from patients.

44:33.871 --> 44:36.670
It's realised in interpersonal contacts,

44:36.691 --> 44:38.909
so trust is essential.

44:39.436 --> 44:41.372
It is not my place to judge him

44:41.407 --> 44:43.582
for what he may or may not have done,

44:43.753 --> 44:46.564
but I will try to get to
the truth of the matter

44:46.864 --> 44:49.008
for the courts and for you.

44:50.528 --> 44:52.078
He is going to prison.

44:53.792 --> 44:55.405
Let me show you out.

44:58.803 --> 45:01.163
All right, boys.

45:01.282 --> 45:02.963
Out you come.

45:10.283 --> 45:12.279
You should try to eat
some fruit at least.

46:22.929 --> 46:24.748
Rose Stagg is waiting for you, Ma'am.

46:24.759 --> 46:26.502
- Oh, right.
- She's in the interview room.

46:26.545 --> 46:28.945
What's... What's happening
with the Benedetto girl?

46:28.966 --> 46:31.586
She's in custody, due
in court again tomorrow.

46:32.757 --> 46:34.786
- Will you sit in with us, Gail?
- Yes, Ma'am.

46:38.831 --> 46:40.994
<i>What's the next thing that you remember?</i>

46:42.960 --> 46:44.198
Darkness.

46:45.325 --> 46:46.647
And movement,

46:47.104 --> 46:48.680
being thrown around.

46:51.368 --> 46:54.066
I think he must have drugged
me when he gave me water.

46:57.953 --> 47:00.749
It took me a while to work
out what was happening...

47:01.671 --> 47:03.159
that I was in the car,

47:03.726 --> 47:05.163
in the boot of a car.

47:06.910 --> 47:08.532
It was terrifying.

47:08.834 --> 47:10.601
I was thrown around horribly,

47:10.627 --> 47:12.232
particularly towards the end.

47:12.730 --> 47:14.354
I felt like a rag doll.

47:15.406 --> 47:17.479
Every bump made me cry out.

47:19.984 --> 47:21.534
Then the car stopped,

47:22.555 --> 47:24.192
the engine was turned off.

47:26.476 --> 47:28.541
The driver's door opened...

47:31.563 --> 47:33.052
... and then silence.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.233
I waited and waited...

47:38.441 --> 47:39.930
but nothing happened.

47:43.072 --> 47:45.367
I realised I'd been left there alone.

47:48.016 --> 47:51.335
There were some old
water bottles in the boot

47:51.917 --> 47:53.628
so at first I could drink.

47:55.288 --> 47:56.789
But then there was none left.

47:59.039 --> 48:01.448
I tried to pull the brake lights out

48:01.700 --> 48:03.250
to let in more air,

48:03.991 --> 48:05.691
but I couldn't shift them.

48:07.914 --> 48:09.282
I felt so weak.

48:10.722 --> 48:12.117
There was no air.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.345
I became obsessed

48:17.362 --> 48:19.168
with the sound of my own breathing.

48:20.306 --> 48:21.884
I'd fall asleep, but

48:23.304 --> 48:25.089
I'd have no idea for how long.

48:27.028 --> 48:29.185
At first I thought I could tell

48:29.677 --> 48:32.589
whether it was day or night
from the smell of the air,

48:35.269 --> 48:37.722
but then the air got staler and staler.

48:40.833 --> 48:42.933
I lost all track of time.

48:48.635 --> 48:50.624
I tried to think about the kids,

48:52.576 --> 48:54.103
but I couldn't focus.

48:56.979 --> 48:59.415
I felt my brain was shutting down.

49:03.101 --> 49:06.160
The last thing I remember

49:07.264 --> 49:09.364
was thinking that I should burrow,

49:10.605 --> 49:13.827
that I should dig down
into the earth to hide,

49:14.442 --> 49:16.256
to feel safe and warm.

49:18.004 --> 49:19.157
Like an animal,

49:19.536 --> 49:20.578
digging...

49:27.251 --> 49:29.616
I don't remember anything after that.

49:32.114 --> 49:33.295
Thank you.

49:40.823 --> 49:43.256
Can I talk to you...

49:44.690 --> 49:45.794
alone?

49:46.446 --> 49:47.786
Without the tape?

49:52.000 --> 49:53.809
This is DC Gail McNally

49:53.823 --> 49:57.400
suspending the interview at 10.43pm.

50:14.592 --> 50:16.017
I haven't been...

50:18.994 --> 50:21.507
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

50:22.796 --> 50:24.349
I led you to believe

50:24.371 --> 50:26.995
that after that one
time he strangled me,

50:27.411 --> 50:28.785
that it ended.

50:31.823 --> 50:33.172
But it didn't.

50:35.621 --> 50:37.348
I suspected as much.

50:43.131 --> 50:44.738
It wasn't that simple.

50:46.999 --> 50:49.341
We went to some dark places.

50:51.721 --> 50:53.421
The first time it happened,

50:53.817 --> 50:55.212
I was giving him...

50:56.162 --> 50:57.245
I was...

50:57.477 --> 50:59.012
using my mouth on him.

51:01.331 --> 51:03.749
He squeezed his legs around my neck.

51:04.890 --> 51:07.129
I couldn't breathe. I was...

51:10.247 --> 51:11.606
Take your time.

51:14.054 --> 51:15.474
Er...

51:22.882 --> 51:24.795
He squeezed really tight.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.169
I thought I was going to pass out but

51:28.289 --> 51:29.540
he released me.

51:34.582 --> 51:36.189
He treated it a bit like a game,

51:36.224 --> 51:37.310
at first.

51:39.915 --> 51:41.920
I'd already begun to
think he didn't have

51:41.929 --> 51:44.427
much enthusiasm for
ordinary intercourse...

51:47.063 --> 51:49.326
... but then things got more serious.

51:53.475 --> 51:55.148
He asked me to play dead.

51:58.135 --> 52:00.984
And then there was the
time that I told you about.

52:02.550 --> 52:04.946
I think he revived me, mouth to mouth.

52:09.379 --> 52:13.008
There were times when he
wanted to use a plastic bag

52:13.523 --> 52:14.561
on me,

52:15.818 --> 52:17.141
on himself.

52:21.268 --> 52:23.421
He said that we all

52:23.784 --> 52:25.213
try to live in the light,

52:26.135 --> 52:28.646
that we all try to build walls around us

52:28.659 --> 52:30.285
to block out the darkness,

52:30.404 --> 52:32.073
the danger that's out there,

52:32.719 --> 52:33.931
but it can't be done,

52:34.184 --> 52:35.192
it's a lie,

52:36.266 --> 52:39.256
that in reality there
are dark gods out there

52:40.267 --> 52:43.377
and that men could become gods on earth

52:43.738 --> 52:45.713
through a certain kind of sex.

52:47.381 --> 52:48.623
And women?

52:49.772 --> 52:50.917
I think so.

52:52.226 --> 52:53.411
I'm sorry.

52:54.422 --> 52:56.086
I can't really explain it.

53:00.573 --> 53:02.224
Why did you walk away?

53:06.038 --> 53:07.375
It felt to me

53:07.953 --> 53:10.314
that everything that was happening

53:10.318 --> 53:12.475
was about pleasing him.

53:15.514 --> 53:17.591
That it wasn't about me at all.

53:20.795 --> 53:22.750
I left him and I went back to Tom.

53:23.342 --> 53:24.983
And what about Spector?

53:27.150 --> 53:28.657
He went to London,

53:28.954 --> 53:29.860
I think.

53:31.843 --> 53:33.897
Did you and Spector ever do drugs?

53:34.377 --> 53:36.932
- I think I told you that we drank a lot.
- Hm.

53:37.101 --> 53:38.051
Cocaine?

53:38.455 --> 53:39.289
No,

53:40.287 --> 53:42.359
not with me, but maybe he did back then.

53:50.499 --> 53:53.142
My life with Tom couldn't
be more different.

53:54.819 --> 53:56.088
Things have been difficult

53:56.106 --> 53:57.605
since the birth of Cody.

53:59.972 --> 54:02.414
Actually, since my first Caesarean.

54:04.998 --> 54:06.405
And how are they now?

54:08.452 --> 54:09.892
It's strange.

54:11.730 --> 54:13.454
When he talks to me now, I...

54:15.527 --> 54:17.825
don't really listen to
the words that he's saying,

54:18.829 --> 54:20.687
just to the tone of his voice.

54:22.796 --> 54:24.326
From that I can work out

54:24.348 --> 54:26.004
whether he likes me or not,

54:26.899 --> 54:29.248
whether he's emotionally close to me.

54:35.380 --> 54:36.943
Right now, he's angry...

54:40.237 --> 54:42.357
... and I don't think
he likes me very much.

54:45.363 --> 54:46.495
Rose,

54:48.266 --> 54:50.458
there's something I need to tell you.

54:57.782 --> 54:58.808
I think that...

55:00.285 --> 55:01.732
I'm the reason that

55:01.777 --> 55:03.748
Paul Spector came after you.

55:06.741 --> 55:07.846
How?

55:10.380 --> 55:11.805
I think I...

55:13.991 --> 55:16.912
I think I revealed your
identity as my informant

55:16.930 --> 55:19.255
when I used his name, Peter.

55:20.980 --> 55:23.799
The name that you gave me when
I spoke to him on the phone.

55:28.618 --> 55:30.046
Using that name,

55:31.778 --> 55:34.918
together with the E-Fit
that we had created,

55:35.562 --> 55:37.694
I think led him straight to you.

55:39.511 --> 55:40.417
I was

55:41.485 --> 55:43.265
trying to convey that...

55:44.691 --> 55:46.393
... well, that we were on to him.

55:48.341 --> 55:51.287
I was trying to scare
him to stop the attacks.

55:54.881 --> 55:57.588
And it worked to the
extent that he ran, but...

55:59.735 --> 56:01.213
but when we didn't do anything,

56:01.231 --> 56:02.703
when we didn't pounce...

56:05.903 --> 56:07.378
he came after you.

56:14.063 --> 56:15.514
I hadn't realised

56:15.633 --> 56:18.021
your relationship was
so meaningful to him.

56:25.245 --> 56:27.393
He said I was the only one.

56:31.190 --> 56:33.024
That I was the only girl.

56:37.628 --> 56:38.983
I believe it.

56:57.686 --> 57:00.703
I'm glad I'm not the only
one to have made mistakes.

57:07.417 --> 57:08.801
Thank you.

57:20.591 --> 57:24.665
Go fuck that!
Jesus fucking Christ!

57:37.483 --> 57:38.972
I'm Mark Bailey.

57:41.018 --> 57:42.280
Who are you?

57:49.199 --> 57:51.269
I'm told I'm the Belfast Strangler.

57:54.795 --> 57:56.167
Are you?

57:59.154 --> 58:00.416
Maybe.

58:01.476 --> 58:03.444
Right now, I don't remember.

58:09.789 --> 58:11.604
Wasn't well. Better now.

58:13.251 --> 58:15.048
Wasn't well. Better now.

58:16.175 --> 58:17.957
Wasn't well. Better now.
