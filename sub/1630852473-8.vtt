00:02.377 --> 00:04.379
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.462 --> 00:06.631
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:07.424 --> 00:09.426
(lively music)

00:11.594 --> 00:12.679
(elephants trumpeting)

00:18.977 --> 00:20.186
MAN 1: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:21.896
(moans)

00:21.980 --> 00:23.356
(screaming)

00:30.363 --> 00:33.658
MAN 2:
<i>It might be weeks, it might be years.</i>

00:33.992 --> 00:36.202
<i>No matter how much time passes...</i>

00:36.286 --> 00:37.495
(boings)

00:37.954 --> 00:39.456
<i>...you'll never unhear...</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:45.628
NARRATOR: <i>It's a Small World,
one of Disneyland's most revered</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:49.007
<i>and, let's face it,
most hummed attractions.</i>

00:49.090 --> 00:50.300
Everybody loves the song.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.843
-Oh, Lord, have mercy.
-WOMAN 1: Oh, no.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.512
NARRATOR: <i>But you might be surprised
to learn that this national treasure</i>

00:54.596 --> 00:57.474
<i>wasn't even close to being there
on day one.</i>

00:57.557 --> 01:01.144
<i>And when it did open,
it was nowhere near the orange groves,</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:04.064
<i>the sunshine, and famous mice of Anaheim.</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:06.566
<i>Instead, it opened here...</i>

01:06.858 --> 01:08.818
<i>in the Big Apple.</i>

01:08.902 --> 01:13.948
<i>And it was what went down
on the gritty streets of New York in 1964</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:16.951
<i>that led to everything
from It's a Small World</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:20.830
<i>through to the incredible
characters of today... and tomorrow.</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:24.709
<i>♪ There's a great, big
Beautiful tomorrow ♪</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:28.004
NARRATOR: <i>Which is another song
you'll have stuck in your head</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:29.547
<i>after this story is done.</i>

01:29.964 --> 01:31.883
<i>But before we talk
about It's a Small World</i>

01:31.966 --> 01:35.678
<i>and the exciting future
of Audio-Animatronics technology,</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:39.140
<i>we need to set sail on a cruise
through history,</i>

01:39.224 --> 01:44.062
<i>docking in the non-existent
port of 1960s Anaheim, California,</i>

01:44.145 --> 01:46.356
<i>or otherwise known as Disneyland.</i>

01:46.439 --> 01:47.774
It's the happiest place on Earth.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.486
NARRATOR: <i>But there was plenty
of room for it to get even happier.</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:55.907
<i>Because when Disneyland opened in 1955,
as amazing as it was...</i>

01:55.990 --> 01:59.202
It was something
completely unique and different,

01:59.285 --> 02:01.162
<i>and people absolutely
fell in love with it.</i>

02:01.246 --> 02:05.208
NARRATOR: <i>And even though there had been
some upgrades, Walt wanted more.</i>

02:05.834 --> 02:07.043
<i>A lot more.</i>

02:07.127 --> 02:08.753
BILL: <i>Walt had been thinking about,</i>

02:08.837 --> 02:11.673
"I've only got a finite amount
of land in Disneyland.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.425
I can only build so much."
He wanted to build more.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.804
Walt's vision was that these parks
would never be completed.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.931
As long as there's
imagination in the world,

02:20.014 --> 02:23.184
<i>the parks like Disneyland
will continue to grow and evolve.</i>

02:23.268 --> 02:26.729
ORLANDO: <i>And you needed technology
to keep improving</i>

02:26.813 --> 02:29.065
in order for you to be able
to do better things

02:29.732 --> 02:31.651
than what we had done before.

02:31.734 --> 02:35.071
Really, breaking molds
every single time we start something.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.197
(laughing)

02:36.281 --> 02:39.784
And that takes cutting-edge technology.
And that costs a lot of money.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.996
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, more money
than even Walt Disney had.</i>

02:43.079 --> 02:47.292
Walt has a number of projects
that he would like to fund,

02:47.375 --> 02:50.587
<i>but he can't get the money
to build what he wants to build.</i>

02:50.670 --> 02:54.966
NARRATOR: <i>Because what Walt Disney
had planned involved technology that...</i>

02:55.675 --> 02:56.885
<i>didn't exist yet.</i>

02:56.968 --> 02:58.469
So, Walt had a big problem.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.513
He just wasn't able
to get the money for it.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.600
NARRATOR: <i>But Walt Disney
wasn't the only one with a problem,</i>

03:03.683 --> 03:06.978
<i>because at the same time,
on the other side of the country,</i>

03:07.478 --> 03:10.523
<i>construction was underway
for nothing less than...</i>

03:10.607 --> 03:12.400
The wonder of the modern world.

03:12.483 --> 03:16.738
NARRATOR: <i>That being
the upcoming 1964-65 World's Fair.</i>

03:17.405 --> 03:21.868
<i>With a long tradition of global hopes,
dreams, and innovation,</i>

03:21.951 --> 03:25.747
<i>the various World's Fairs gave us,
among other stuff,</i>

03:25.830 --> 03:30.793
<i>telephones, the Eiffel Tower,
X-ray machines, chewing gum, zippers,</i>

03:30.877 --> 03:35.715
<i>eh, you know, jet packs,
ice cream cones, and 1982's Cherry Coke.</i>

03:36.549 --> 03:40.887
<i>But the '64-'65 World's Fair?
Well, it was promised to be...</i>

03:40.970 --> 03:44.307
Bigger. There's more to see
and more ground to cover.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.851
NARRATOR: <i>And the man promising
the greatest World's Fair ever</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:47.852
<i>was this one...</i>

03:47.936 --> 03:50.438
Robert Moses was the head
of the '64 World's Fair.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.398
BILL: <i>He was the New York City
Park Commissioner.</i>

03:52.482 --> 03:54.525
NARRATOR: <i>Come on,
he was a little bit more than that.</i>

03:54.609 --> 03:58.655
He was the biggest non-elected official
in New York City for years.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.282
NARRATOR: <i>That's more like it.
Let's put it this way.</i>

04:01.366 --> 04:03.326
<i>-You know who built this bridge?</i>
-Robert Moses.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.577
-NARRATOR: <i>This tunnel?</i>
-Robert Moses.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.787
-NARRATOR: <i>This bridge?</i>
-Robert Moses.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.163
-NARRATOR: <i>This building?</i>
-Robert Moses.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.958
NARRATOR: <i>All these houses?
Oh, what houses? That's right.</i>

04:10.500 --> 04:13.461
<i>Robert Moses knocked them down
and built the UN Headquarters.</i>

04:13.544 --> 04:14.712
Oh, yes, indeed.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.840
NARRATOR: <i>Robert Moses was one
of the most powerful men on Earth.</i>

04:18.258 --> 04:21.886
<i>So, what on Earth does he have to do
with Disneyland?</i>

04:21.970 --> 04:23.763
Because Robert had a big problem.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.016
NARRATOR: <i>Uh-huh, sounds familiar.
But unlike Walt's big problem...</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:28.309
ORLANDO: <i>You needed technology.</i>

04:28.393 --> 04:29.477
TODD: <i>He can't get the money.</i>

04:29.560 --> 04:32.272
NARRATOR: <i>...Robert Moses' problem
was a lot more simple.</i>

04:32.355 --> 04:34.565
Nobody had ever told him the word "no."

04:34.649 --> 04:37.443
BILL: <i>He had ideas on how
he was going to do a World's Fair.</i>

04:37.527 --> 04:40.154
World's Fairs can only run
for six months. Robert Moses says...

04:40.238 --> 04:41.072
No.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.199
"No, mine's gonna run
two six-month seasons."

04:43.574 --> 04:46.286
You can't charge international
participants rent.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.328
No.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.329
"I'm charging rent."

04:48.413 --> 04:50.707
BILL: <i>So, all of a sudden,
all the nations drop out</i>

04:50.790 --> 04:52.000
<i>of the World's Fair.</i>

04:52.083 --> 04:55.003
And they are the key
to the, uh, success of the Fair.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.756
NARRATOR: <i>So, that's a World's Fair
without countries from the world.</i>

04:59.465 --> 05:01.759
Robert Moses has this big problem.
"What do I do?"

05:01.843 --> 05:05.263
NARRATOR: <i>Come on, this is America.
What else would you do?</i>

05:05.346 --> 05:06.431
Turn to private industry.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.473
NARRATOR: <i>Exactly.</i>

05:07.557 --> 05:10.977
MAN 3: <i>Two hundred United States companies
filed for space</i>

05:11.060 --> 05:16.149
<i>within a few days after the meeting.
Response was quick and enthusiastic.</i>

05:16.232 --> 05:18.526
Well, private industry is great.
They've got a lot of money.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.362
But they don't necessarily
have showmanship and ideas.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.282
NARRATOR: <i>Ideas?
Well, this guy had plenty.</i>

05:24.365 --> 05:27.660
BILL: <i>So, Robert Moses went to Walt,
and he basically said to Walt...</i>

05:27.744 --> 05:28.911
(in electronic voice)
<i>"Whatever you want to build...</i>

05:28.995 --> 05:30.204
(in normal voice)
I'll give you any piece of land,

05:30.288 --> 05:31.622
just work with me on this."

05:31.706 --> 05:33.291
NARRATOR: <i>And for Walt, that meant...</i>

05:33.374 --> 05:34.959
He was gonna be able to get the money

05:35.043 --> 05:38.463
to spend and develop great ideas
for Disneyland.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.507
NARRATOR: <i>But wait,
this is just for the World's Fair, so...</i>

05:41.591 --> 05:43.801
Well, Walt thinks that, maybe,

05:44.010 --> 05:48.473
if he can create this all-new technology
for the World's Fair,

05:48.556 --> 05:50.058
he might be able to find the money

05:50.141 --> 05:51.893
to create them there
and then bring them home.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.061
NARRATOR: <i>Bring them home.</i>

05:53.144 --> 05:54.020
Oh, yeah.

05:54.103 --> 05:57.315
NARRATOR: <i>So, the man who wouldn't
take "no" for an answer got a "yes"</i>

05:57.398 --> 06:02.111
<i>from Walt Disney, who wasted no time
in proposing his idea to Robert Moses.</i>

06:02.945 --> 06:09.118
<i>An idea about a cute,
adorable, tall, bearded man. That's right.</i>

06:09.911 --> 06:12.997
<i>Walt pitched
an Abraham Lincoln stage show,</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:16.209
<i>utilizing a cutting-edge,
unheard-of technology.</i>

06:16.292 --> 06:20.421
A human being in robotic form
that's going to have its movements

06:20.505 --> 06:23.174
and voice synchronized with a soundtrack?

06:23.257 --> 06:26.636
Moses immediately said,
"I have to have that for the Fair."

06:26.719 --> 06:29.680
NARRATOR: <i>However, the Fair itself
didn't sponsor exhibits.</i>

06:29.764 --> 06:32.642
<i>Sponsors did.
But finding someone to sponsor</i>

06:32.725 --> 06:34.894
<i>this exciting and innovative project</i>

06:34.977 --> 06:37.647
<i>surely wouldn't be a problem
for Walt Disney.</i>

06:37.730 --> 06:40.358
He invited all the top companies
in the United States

06:40.441 --> 06:41.526
<i>to come and see mockups.</i>

06:41.609 --> 06:42.485
(whistles)

06:42.568 --> 06:45.780
NARRATOR: <i>And after seeing
this revolutionary innovation,</i>

06:45.863 --> 06:48.616
<i>corporate America's response
was naturally...</i>

06:48.699 --> 06:50.410
"Walt, will it help me sell my product?

06:50.493 --> 06:54.539
BILL: <i>How's Abe Lincoln gonna sell cars,
or TVs, or soup, or whatever?"</i>

06:54.622 --> 06:58.793
So, he was really crushed when they said
that they didn't want to sponsor this.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.795
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, but wait,
what about that guy,</i>

07:00.878 --> 07:02.422
<i>who won't take "no" for an answer?</i>

07:03.881 --> 07:06.259
He got the help from Robert Moses,
who said...

07:07.009 --> 07:08.136
-NARRATOR: <i>Well?</i>
-No.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.137
NARRATOR: <i>Big surprise.</i>

07:09.220 --> 07:10.680
Moses said, "I have a sponsor."

07:10.763 --> 07:13.683
"I think I can get the State of Illinois
to sponsor this."

07:13.766 --> 07:17.186
"They want you to put
this in their pavilion at the Fair."

07:17.270 --> 07:19.647
Because Lincoln came from Illinois.

07:19.730 --> 07:22.191
NARRATOR: <i>But, unlike private industry,</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:26.988
<i>state government doesn't have such
a big budget for World's Fair attractions.</i>

07:27.071 --> 07:29.490
The amount of money
that the State of Illinois could afford

07:29.574 --> 07:32.869
<i>was way less than
it was gonna cost Disney to build it.</i>

07:32.952 --> 07:35.288
So, in a very rare step, Robert Moses said

07:35.371 --> 07:37.790
<i>the Fair Corporation
would fund the difference</i>

07:37.874 --> 07:40.918
<i>because he was so desperate to get Walt
to come in with his show.</i>

07:41.002 --> 07:42.837
-NARRATOR: <i>And just like that...</i>
-(cash register clinking)

07:42.920 --> 07:45.298
TODD: <i>Disney and the State of Illinois
come to an agreement</i>

07:45.381 --> 07:48.092
where the Lincoln figure
is going to be the centerpiece attraction

07:48.176 --> 07:49.177
at their pavilion.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.221
NARRATOR: <i>But certainly
not the centerpiece of this story,</i>

07:52.472 --> 07:56.017
<i>because Walt's ambition
was admirably limitless.</i>

07:56.100 --> 07:58.686
<i>And when he heard
that a major car company...</i>

07:58.769 --> 08:00.021
<i>No, not Lincoln.</i>

08:00.104 --> 08:03.608
<i>...was looking for ideas
to fill their big, empty building,</i>

08:04.150 --> 08:06.110
<i>well, Walt Disney pounced.</i>

08:06.194 --> 08:08.279
MAN 4: <i>The Ford Stage
is seven stories tall</i>

08:08.362 --> 08:10.072
<i>and three football fields wide.</i>

08:10.156 --> 08:13.451
NARRATOR: <i>And, luckily,
Walt had some big ideas to pitch.</i>

08:13.534 --> 08:17.330
We have many versions of the script
for the ride in our files.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.957
The very first one seems
to be pretty much brought in

08:20.041 --> 08:23.461
right by Walt Disney,
and it was "Tour of America."

08:23.544 --> 08:25.463
TODD:
<i>You'd go through the Pacific Northwest,</i>

08:25.546 --> 08:28.466
and then the desert,
and then the Eastern Seaboard.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.051
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, sounds lovely!</i>

08:30.134 --> 08:32.637
So Ford said, "No, let's not,
you know, let's not do that."

08:32.845 --> 08:34.847
NARRATOR: <i>But there was one idea
they liked.</i>

08:34.931 --> 08:38.851
Ford likes the idea
of using actual Ford vehicles

08:38.935 --> 08:41.979
<i>as the ride mechanism of the attraction.</i>

08:42.271 --> 08:46.150
People are sitting in real cars.
And it was a genius idea.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.736
NARRATOR: <i>So, as Walt developed
the driving mechanism,</i>

08:48.819 --> 08:52.323
<i>he and his Imagineers went back
to brainstorming potential themes.</i>

08:52.406 --> 08:54.784
And then, Disney came back with...

08:54.867 --> 08:57.453
NARRATOR: <i>No. But don't worry,
we're getting there.</i>

08:57.537 --> 08:59.747
<i>For Ford, the idea was...</i>

09:00.373 --> 09:01.332
DONNA: <i>Dinosaurs.</i>

09:01.415 --> 09:04.919
NARRATOR: <i>That's right, dinosaurs.
Audio-Animatronics ones, of course.</i>

09:05.002 --> 09:07.630
We had the big, large dinosaurs

09:07.964 --> 09:11.634
sitting out in the parking lot
at the facility in Glendale.

09:12.218 --> 09:16.305
NARRATOR: <i>But the so-named
Ford Magic Skyway was to escort guests</i>

09:16.389 --> 09:19.559
<i>on a meandering journey
through time, including...</i>

09:19.642 --> 09:21.394
Comic cavemen.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.981
WALT: <i>It was probably at a crucial time
like this that man invented speech,</i>

09:25.064 --> 09:26.774
<i>starting with, "Hey, look behind you!"</i>

09:26.857 --> 09:29.652
NARRATOR: <i>And ending
with a futuristic vision of tomorrow.</i>

09:30.027 --> 09:32.113
<i>But for Walt, the future was now,</i>

09:32.405 --> 09:35.366
<i>because now he had two major sponsors,</i>

09:35.449 --> 09:36.784
<i>and, most importantly,</i>

09:36.867 --> 09:41.122
<i>the resources to develop expensive
Audio-Animatronics technology.</i>

09:41.205 --> 09:42.582
Yes, Audio-Animatronics.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.835
NARRATOR: <i>But, well, this is
where things get interesting.</i>

09:45.918 --> 09:50.131
Another company comes to Walt
and says, "We'd like to do something."

09:50.214 --> 09:52.592
NARRATOR: <i>That's right,
another potential sponsor.</i>

09:52.675 --> 09:53.968
General Electric.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.845
NARRATOR:
<i>And they had quite a bright idea.</i>

09:55.928 --> 09:57.763
CHRIS: <i>GE wanted to tell the story</i>

09:57.847 --> 10:00.224
of the betterment of humanity
through electricity.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.602
MAN 5: <i>We put the accent on value.</i>

10:02.685 --> 10:05.062
NARRATOR:
<i>For Walt, it was quite good value.</i>

10:05.146 --> 10:08.482
<i>So, he agreed to develop
an exhibit for General Electric as well.</i>

10:08.733 --> 10:10.026
<i>And why not?</i>

10:10.109 --> 10:13.863
<i>At this point, between attractions
for the State of Illinois,</i>

10:13.946 --> 10:17.908
<i>the Ford Motor Company,
and now for General Electric as well,</i>

10:17.992 --> 10:20.661
<i>it's fair to say that the Fair itself</i>

10:20.745 --> 10:23.706
<i>was giving Walt an abundance
of opportunity.</i>

10:23.998 --> 10:25.541
<i>And his earlier problem...</i>

10:25.625 --> 10:28.586
He can't get the money to build
what he wants to build.

10:28.669 --> 10:33.090
<i>...had now been replaced
by a very different one, the workload.</i>

10:33.174 --> 10:34.133
It was crazy.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.343
Because we have
so many different disciplines

10:35.426 --> 10:36.469
that need to come together.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.470
NARRATOR: <i>Disciplines?</i>

10:37.553 --> 10:39.764
KARIN: <i>The creative side,
and what the character looks like,</i>

10:39.847 --> 10:41.974
<i>how it's going to be posed,
how it's going to be staged,</i>

10:42.058 --> 10:44.477
<i>how it's going to be animated
through the engineering.</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:46.646
<i>Electrical, and audio and visual.</i>

10:46.729 --> 10:48.064
(roaring)

10:48.147 --> 10:50.608
And then costuming, and figure finishing,

10:50.691 --> 10:52.985
and making sure that it actually
doesn't look like a robot.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.445
NARRATOR: <i>Not on the outside, at least.</i>

10:54.528 --> 10:57.365
Everyone had a job,
everyone knew what they were gonna do,

10:57.448 --> 10:59.408
and everyone knew
they were gonna get there.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.827
NARRATOR: <i>"There" being New York City.</i>

11:01.911 --> 11:04.288
<i>And while construction
there was well underway,</i>

11:04.372 --> 11:06.540
<i>back in Anaheim, construction,</i>

11:06.624 --> 11:10.711
<i>well, stopped on anything
that wasn't World Fair related.</i>

11:10.795 --> 11:12.713
<i>And with only about a year to go...</i>

11:12.797 --> 11:15.633
The entire Disney team
has been called on to develop

11:15.716 --> 11:19.470
entertaining and exciting attractions
for our World's Fair.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.889
NARRATOR: <i>And, as seen here
with the GE exhibit,</i>

11:21.972 --> 11:24.058
<i>it was clear that Walt's dream</i>

11:24.141 --> 11:28.020
<i>of creating an Audio-Animatronics human
was very much alive.</i>

11:28.270 --> 11:29.980
<i>Ooh, that one's a real person.</i>

11:30.064 --> 11:34.360
Now, this contraption here might
look like something from outer space,

11:34.610 --> 11:39.198
but it's actually a control harness
for programming the actions and gestures

11:39.281 --> 11:41.200
of our Audio-Animatronic figures.

11:41.617 --> 11:42.743
A broad gesture...

11:43.452 --> 11:45.663
to the wink of an eye.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.623
That's it. Thank you.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.500
NARRATOR: <i>No, Walt, thank you.</i>

11:49.583 --> 11:51.293
<i>Well, it was still too early to say,</i>

11:51.377 --> 11:55.715
<i>but it was looking like Walt
was gonna pull it off just in time.</i>

11:55.798 --> 11:57.258
<i>With ten months to go,</i>

11:57.341 --> 11:59.885
<i>his Imagineers had been pushed
to the breaking point.</i>

11:59.969 --> 12:04.473
<i>♪ There's a great, big
Beautiful tomorrow ♪</i>

12:04.557 --> 12:07.226
<i>♪ Shining at the end of every day ♪</i>

12:07.309 --> 12:09.103
-NARRATOR: <i>But then, one day...</i>
-(singing) <i>♪ There's a great... ♪</i>

12:09.186 --> 12:10.479
(telephone ringing)

12:10.563 --> 12:11.731
NARRATOR: <i>...the phone rang.</i>

12:11.814 --> 12:14.358
There's one piece of land
in Flushing Meadows

12:14.608 --> 12:18.487
that doesn't have a project attached to it
at the start of 1963.

12:18.779 --> 12:22.742
NARRATOR: <i>Seeing an opportunity to fill
that vacant land at the World's Fair,</i>

12:22.825 --> 12:25.244
<i>Disney HQ received a call from...</i>

12:25.327 --> 12:27.079
Pepsi, the light refreshment.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.165
BILL: <i>Pepsi had decided they want
to be in the World's Fair,</i>

12:29.248 --> 12:31.041
and we have no idea
what we're gonna put in there.

12:31.333 --> 12:35.421
NARRATOR: <i>Well, obviously, word had spread
about the great Walt Disney's eagerness</i>

12:35.504 --> 12:37.047
<i>to be involved with the Fair.</i>

12:38.007 --> 12:39.842
<i>However, with time running out</i>

12:39.925 --> 12:42.803
<i>and three major projects
already underway...</i>

12:42.887 --> 12:44.513
One of Walt's executives said...

12:46.557 --> 12:47.516
no.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.810
NARRATOR: <i>And here's the problem
with that answer.</i>

12:49.894 --> 12:53.814
Walt would have nobody around him
that was negative.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.234
But if you said,
"That's impossible," you didn't last long.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.528
NARRATOR: <i>But in this case,
only ten months out?</i>

12:59.612 --> 13:01.989
<i>Come on, it really was impossible.</i>

13:02.072 --> 13:03.324
<i>End of discussion.</i>

13:03.407 --> 13:05.659
<i>No need to even bother Walt
with such nonsense.</i>

13:05.743 --> 13:07.369
<i>He'll never even know.</i>

13:07.453 --> 13:11.415
Well, Walt one day runs
into Joan Crawford, and she says,

13:11.499 --> 13:13.959
"Oh, it's really too bad
you couldn't build my ride for me."

13:14.043 --> 13:15.044
And he said, "What do you mean?"

13:15.127 --> 13:16.921
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, what do you mean?</i>

13:17.004 --> 13:20.883
<i>And also, what does Academy Award-winning
actress Joan Crawford</i>

13:20.966 --> 13:22.218
<i>have to do with this?</i>

13:22.301 --> 13:24.303
Joan was on the board of directors
at Pepsi.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.972
NARRATOR: <i>Joan Crawford's late husband,
Alfred Steele,</i>

13:27.056 --> 13:29.266
<i>had been the President of Pepsi Cola.</i>

13:29.350 --> 13:32.645
<i>After his death,
she was placed on the board of directors.</i>

13:32.728 --> 13:35.439
And she had approached
the Disney Company about building,

13:35.523 --> 13:37.024
-uh, a ride.
-(telephone ringing)

13:37.107 --> 13:39.777
NARRATOR: <i>Wait. It was Joan who called?</i>

13:39.860 --> 13:41.237
WOMAN 2: <i>Build my attraction.</i>

13:41.320 --> 13:42.905
So, one of Walt's executives said...

13:42.988 --> 13:43.989
No.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.620
Said, "We just can't do it.
We're just too busy."

13:50.913 --> 13:54.458
NARRATOR: <i>Now, it may have been
Joan Crawford's persuasive ways,</i>

13:54.542 --> 13:57.753
<i>or it might have been
Walt's endless enthusiasm</i>

13:57.837 --> 13:59.296
<i>for taking on the impossible,</i>

13:59.380 --> 14:03.175
<i>or perhaps it was his overwhelming
need to be a good guy.</i>

14:03.259 --> 14:06.303
<i>Because Pepsi did do things in good taste.</i>

14:06.387 --> 14:08.889
BOB: <i>The Pepsi Cola Company
always had a history</i>

14:08.973 --> 14:10.808
of community involvement.

14:10.891 --> 14:14.228
The profits from this would go
to the charity UNICEF.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.982
The United Nations Children's Fund,
a worldwide organization

14:18.065 --> 14:21.360
that is working for a better tomorrow
by helping the children of today.

14:21.443 --> 14:24.280
MARC: You know, Walt was always moved
by children,

14:24.780 --> 14:27.575
so I think this show meant
a great deal to him.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.035
Looking forward to it like
a lot of happy kids.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.496
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, Walt and the kids were excited.</i>

14:32.580 --> 14:34.206
<i>But as for the Imagineers...</i>

14:34.290 --> 14:38.586
BILL: You can imagine how the staff felt
when they're going crazy.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.672
And Walt comes in one day and says,
"By the way, I want to do another show.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.549
I've got this idea
for this little boat ride."

14:43.632 --> 14:44.466
(brakes screech)

14:44.550 --> 14:46.594
"There's a little space left
at the World's Fair,

14:46.677 --> 14:48.804
and I think we ought to do
something with it."

14:48.888 --> 14:50.973
All of a sudden, they go,
"What? Where are we gonna do this?"

14:51.056 --> 14:53.559
Logistically, it was an impossible thing
for them to do.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.103
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, come on, they hadn't
even heard the idea yet.</i>

14:56.186 --> 14:57.438
Well, get the children of the world.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.523
They're gonna do what?
They're gonna sing songs.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.524
NARRATOR: <i>One more thing.</i>

15:00.608 --> 15:04.486
It's a flume ride, which is a boat
that's sort of navigating through a canal.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.238
NARRATOR: <i>Yep, that sounds impossible.</i>

15:06.322 --> 15:08.824
And Walt just said, "Well, I think
we're gonna do the impossible."

15:08.908 --> 15:11.660
He says, "We're gonna do this.
We've got to do this."

15:11.744 --> 15:13.954
We all kind of looked at each other
and said, "Okay."

15:14.038 --> 15:15.456
-NARRATOR: <i>However...</i>
-Well...

15:15.539 --> 15:18.125
<i>One brave man stood up</i>

15:18.208 --> 15:22.046
<i>and faced the creative juggernaut
of Walt Disney head on.</i>

15:22.129 --> 15:23.297
Joe Fowler says...

15:23.380 --> 15:24.214
Boy, oh, boy.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.883
TODD: <i>"This is a terrible idea.</i>

15:25.966 --> 15:29.470
There is no way that this can be done
in 11 months."

15:29.553 --> 15:31.388
He was smart for what he said.
"We can't do it."

15:31.472 --> 15:34.558
I mean, logistically,
it was an impossible thing for them to do.

15:34.850 --> 15:39.313
And Walt tells Joe Fowler
that he's in charge of this enterprise

15:39.396 --> 15:44.026
and he will decide what it is they are
going to or are not going to do.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.987
Walt came in to work the next morning
and reminded everybody,

15:47.071 --> 15:51.033
"My name is on the front gate, not yours.
We're gonna do that ride."

15:51.325 --> 15:55.287
NARRATOR: <i>And luckily for Joe,
his name stayed on the Disney payroll.</i>

15:55.371 --> 15:58.999
<i>But Walt had plans
for this opinionated employee.</i>

15:59.083 --> 16:00.751
He asked me to go back

16:00.834 --> 16:06.507
and meet with the board of directors
of Pepsi Cola.

16:06.757 --> 16:10.052
The board at that time
was composed of Joan Crawford

16:10.135 --> 16:12.554
<i>and four or five old gentlemen.</i>

16:12.638 --> 16:18.060
Good God, they had completed
their usefulness years previously.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.437
<i>And one of them said to me,</i>

16:20.521 --> 16:25.985
"Well, what has your boss decided now
in the way of an automated mouse

16:26.068 --> 16:27.444
that might interest us?"

16:27.528 --> 16:30.447
<i>At this point, Joan Crawford stepped in,</i>

16:30.531 --> 16:34.827
and she gave those two boys
a beautiful dressing down.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.286
Are you kidding?

16:36.370 --> 16:42.209
She says, "I apologize. Let's get ahead.
What do you want? Here's what we want."

16:42.543 --> 16:46.839
And in ten minutes,
we finalized on what we were to do.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.424
And from this point forward,

16:48.757 --> 16:53.345
they are going to make an indoor dark ride
about the children of the world.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.222
NARRATOR: <i>So, if Walt hadn't run</i>

16:55.305 --> 16:58.350
<i>into Joan Crawford at that party,
who knows?</i>

16:58.434 --> 17:00.352
It came that close not being done.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.981
NARRATOR: <i>Well, of course,
it is a small world after all.</i>

17:04.064 --> 17:04.940
(laughs)

17:05.232 --> 17:07.151
NARRATOR:
<i>So, as a kind of crazy afterthought,</i>

17:07.234 --> 17:09.778
<i>the idea for what would become
It's a Small World</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:13.240
<i>was conceived with just nine months
until delivery.</i>

17:13.323 --> 17:14.158
Yeah.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.618
NARRATOR: <i>Long enough
to make one small person, perhaps.</i>

17:16.702 --> 17:17.703
Nine months is right.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.414
NARRATOR: <i>Certainly not
a couple of hundred or so,</i>

17:20.497 --> 17:23.584
<i>as well as about a thousand feet
of indoor river</i>

17:23.667 --> 17:25.878
<i>and all the boats for the river.</i>

17:25.961 --> 17:28.922
<i>It's probably safe to say
they were in over their heads.</i>

17:29.006 --> 17:31.467
When you see how long it takes
to do anything today,

17:31.550 --> 17:35.846
to do the whole show in nine months is...
it's just mind-boggling to think about.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.850
Now, you do a major show,
it'll take four to five years.

17:40.267 --> 17:44.021
NARRATOR: <i>Or more. For example,
Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance</i>

17:44.104 --> 17:46.690
<i>took five years from start to finish.</i>

17:46.774 --> 17:48.525
<i>Even The Haunted Mansion,</i>

17:48.609 --> 17:52.237
<i>just one little old haunted house,
took more than a decade.</i>

17:52.321 --> 17:56.575
<i>But to be fair, It's a Small World
did have something to do with that.</i>

17:56.658 --> 18:00.079
I was moved off The Haunted Mansion
to work on Small World.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.624
NARRATOR: <i>So, as The Haunted Mansion
gained actual cobwebs,</i>

18:03.707 --> 18:06.043
<i>It's a Small World gained speed.</i>

18:06.126 --> 18:08.253
It was insane what they had to have done.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.756
That was the fastest
we ever had to do one.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.508
NARRATOR: <i>At this point,</i>

18:12.591 --> 18:16.720
<i>any remaining Imagineers
were diverted to the task at hand.</i>

18:16.804 --> 18:19.098
Walt would move us around
to different projects.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.517
So what you did was you did
what he asked you to do.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.562
NARRATOR: <i>And Walt asked elite Imagineer,
Marc Davis.</i>

18:25.646 --> 18:30.567
Marc Davis is the master
in charge of our House of Illusions.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.945
NARRATOR:
<i>As one of Walt's original animators,</i>

18:33.028 --> 18:35.405
<i>Marc Davis designed Cinderella,</i>

18:36.323 --> 18:40.869
<i>Tinker Bell, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty,
and Cruella de Vil.</i>

18:40.953 --> 18:42.538
To design up some scenarios

18:42.621 --> 18:45.415
for an attraction
about children of the world.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.542
NARRATOR: <i>Marc said...</i>

18:46.625 --> 18:48.544
Okay. Um...

18:49.211 --> 18:54.049
NARRATOR: <i>Crunched for time, the legendary
Imagineer picked up his... scissors?</i>

18:54.133 --> 18:56.051
I just did little paper cutouts.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.805
An example of that would be
these little sketches here.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.432
He took a look at the sketches
that Marc did and he said...

19:03.433 --> 19:05.102
"What's Mary Blair doing?"

19:05.185 --> 19:09.189
NARRATOR: <i>Good question.
Now, uh, who's Mary Blair?</i>

19:09.273 --> 19:12.609
She is considered iconic.
She is a Disney Legend.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.947
Mary Blair was a wonderful storyteller,
if you've ever seen any of her storybooks.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.032
KIM: <i>And I can see
how Walt was so interested</i>

19:19.116 --> 19:21.660
<i>in having her come work with him
at the studio.</i>

19:21.743 --> 19:23.537
Her style was like a little girl.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.665
She... she painted
and drew like she was a little girl.

19:26.748 --> 19:32.129
She has, um, a style in which she presents
extremely innocent-looking children

19:32.629 --> 19:35.424
<i>in this flat, modern style.</i>

19:35.507 --> 19:38.177
She uses these children repeatedly
for storybooks

19:38.260 --> 19:43.682
and also for Hanes underwear ads
and for dairy ads, for ice cream.

19:43.765 --> 19:48.145
And Walt would like to have something
that looks like those children.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.730
NARRATOR: <i>But when Walt asked...</i>

19:49.813 --> 19:50.856
"What's Mary Blair doing?"

19:50.939 --> 19:52.441
-NARRATOR: <i>Well, the answer?</i>
-She had retired.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.651
NARRATOR: <i>But this time,
it was Walt who said...</i>

19:54.735 --> 19:55.569
So...

19:55.652 --> 19:57.321
So they pulled her out of retirement.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.864
I want you to meet Mary Blair.

19:58.947 --> 20:02.492
NARRATOR: <i>Who dutifully returned
to the floor of the Imagineering workshop</i>

20:02.576 --> 20:06.038
<i>to undertake perhaps the biggest task
of her career.</i>

20:06.121 --> 20:10.417
We start this way,
making a preliminary sketch.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.794
Then we'd make a model to scale.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.963
TODD: <i>And so, she comes up
with the scenarios,</i>

20:15.047 --> 20:16.465
<i>the stages they're going to use,</i>

20:16.548 --> 20:19.259
and then she hands them off to a sculptor.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.179
HARRIET: <i>Then I made a little girl's dress</i>

20:22.262 --> 20:25.515
<i>and a little boy's dress
for the actual size dolls.</i>

20:25.599 --> 20:27.851
And I used
my daughter's little baby dresses,

20:27.935 --> 20:31.188
as a matter of fact, the skirt,
and then made a lederhosen for the boy.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.357
<i>And then we took them to the machine shop,</i>

20:33.440 --> 20:37.027
<i>put them on forms
that did a basic little dance.</i>

20:37.319 --> 20:39.238
And they looked cute as could be.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.407
NARRATOR: <i>Cute? Come on,
any doll in a dress is cute.</i>

20:42.491 --> 20:45.118
<i>For this to be legit,
it needed to be authentic.</i>

20:45.202 --> 20:49.331
Imagineers spent quality time
on each one of these figures

20:49.414 --> 20:53.877
to make sure that they were
representing them in the right way.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.713
NARRATOR: <i>But they'd be representing
every continent on Earth.</i>

20:56.797 --> 20:59.049
<i>And despite what the song
would have you believe,</i>

20:59.132 --> 21:01.051
<i>it's actually a pretty big world</i>

21:01.134 --> 21:03.387
<i>with a lot of different countries
and cultures.</i>

21:03.470 --> 21:08.308
Whether it was the jewelry,
the texture, the color, the hairstyle,

21:08.392 --> 21:10.727
<i>everything was accurate.</i>

21:11.019 --> 21:13.438
NARRATOR: <i>Every continent
on Earth was represented,</i>

21:13.522 --> 21:18.110
<i>which meant roughly 480 eyeballs,
960 limbs,</i>

21:18.193 --> 21:22.698
<i>for a total of 240 hand-crafted,
authentically dressed figures.</i>

21:22.781 --> 21:26.243
<i>As well as everything else
that would be inside the exhibit,</i>

21:26.326 --> 21:27.744
<i>which in itself was a lot.</i>

21:27.828 --> 21:29.955
You're in a boat and you can look
any way you want,

21:30.038 --> 21:32.791
and you're surrounded
by a... a world of things to see.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.626
MICHAEL: <i>Glitter, blinking lights.</i>

21:34.710 --> 21:37.671
And the massive toys
that exist in the ride.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.841
NARRATOR: <i>Clearly, the Imagineers
still had a lot of ground to cover.</i>

21:40.924 --> 21:42.426
<i>Now, speaking of ground...</i>

21:42.509 --> 21:44.261
Boats are cool. Water is interesting.

21:44.344 --> 21:47.639
NARRATOR: <i>Both good points,
but there's something else about boats.</i>

21:47.723 --> 21:49.558
Boats can put a lot of people on it.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.477
And a thing like the World's Fair
has a lot of people visiting it.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.604
NARRATOR: <i>Attendance for the Fair
was expected to be</i>

21:54.688 --> 21:56.857
<i>about 70 million people,</i>

21:56.940 --> 22:02.029
<i>so Walt would need a lot of boats
and a river big enough to put them in.</i>

22:02.112 --> 22:05.907
'Cause Disney really didn't have
the... the space and the ability

22:05.991 --> 22:07.659
to do that on their own at that time.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.869
NARRATOR: <i>But not to worry.</i>

22:09.161 --> 22:11.621
<i>Walt had been working
with a small company of engineers</i>

22:11.705 --> 22:13.415
<i>called Arrow Development,</i>

22:13.832 --> 22:18.003
<i>and they were largely responsible
for developing the transport systems of...</i>

22:18.086 --> 22:21.131
The motorboat crews,
the infamous flying saucers.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.425
-NARRATOR: <i>And of course...</i>
-The Matterhorn Bobsleds.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.720
NARRATOR: <i>So, logically,
Walt asked Arrow Development</i>

22:26.803 --> 22:27.971
<i>to jump in the deep end</i>

22:28.055 --> 22:31.266
<i>and whip together a mid-sized river
in a matter of months.</i>

22:31.600 --> 22:34.019
<i>And like everybody else, they said...</i>

22:34.102 --> 22:35.437
"How are we gonna do all this?"

22:35.520 --> 22:36.480
-NARRATOR: <i>Well...</i>
-Uh...

22:36.563 --> 22:37.564
NARRATOR: <i>Quickly is how.</i>

22:37.647 --> 22:39.816
Often when you build a ride,
they build a little circuit,

22:39.900 --> 22:43.236
a little oval, a little something smaller
just to test the engineering out, but...

22:43.320 --> 22:44.154
NARRATOR: <i>Not this time.</i>

22:44.237 --> 22:45.614
NICHOLAS: <i>They wanted to do the full test,</i>

22:45.697 --> 22:47.115
especially when you have something
in water

22:47.199 --> 22:49.493
where water doesn't always do
what you want it to do.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.370
<i>The full-on prototype
for It's a Small World</i>

22:51.453 --> 22:54.039
<i>was built in a backyard along Highway 101</i>

22:54.122 --> 22:56.541
<i>that people driving by would see
this little boat trough,</i>

22:56.625 --> 22:58.085
<i>uh, going all over the place.</i>

22:58.960 --> 23:01.630
NARRATOR: <i>Back on dry land,
the Imagineers were drowning</i>

23:01.713 --> 23:05.258
<i>in a brightly colored creation
that was still far from finished.</i>

23:05.342 --> 23:08.678
You know, "Marc, you start designing this.
Mary, I need you to work on this."

23:08.762 --> 23:12.057
I had all the different people
designing the little buildings.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.310
ROLLY: <i>And we were there
with the carpenters all day long,</i>

23:15.394 --> 23:18.814
<i>making sure that all the...
everything was being built properly.</i>

23:18.897 --> 23:22.192
All the space was taken up,
and so as they finish that,

23:22.275 --> 23:25.946
they put them in plastic bags,
and then they hoist them up,

23:26.029 --> 23:27.781
<i>and they attach them to the ceiling,</i>

23:27.864 --> 23:30.158
<i>because that's the only place left
to store the stuff</i>

23:30.242 --> 23:32.994
before they put it on a truck
to send it out to New York.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.288
NARRATOR: <i>And this cacophony of building,</i>

23:35.372 --> 23:38.792
<i>banging, and hanging
must have been music to Walt's ears.</i>

23:38.875 --> 23:40.043
(singing)
<i>♪ It's a small world after all ♪</i>

23:40.127 --> 23:41.336
NARRATOR: <i>Speaking of music...</i>

23:41.420 --> 23:44.464
No! No, anything but that.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.134
At first, they were gonna sing
their own national anthems.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.511
And it's just noise.

23:49.594 --> 23:53.306
It sounded like a million kids
all singing different things.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.975
(singing indistinctly)

23:55.058 --> 23:56.518
BILL: <i>It was an assault on the ears</i>

23:56.601 --> 23:59.604
because you don't have a smooth transition
from room to room.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.690
(singing indistinctly)

24:01.773 --> 24:03.692
It was a cacophony.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.571
And this is where, um, he brings in...

24:07.654 --> 24:11.158
Songwriters Dick and Bob Sherman
of the Walt Disney Studio.

24:11.241 --> 24:14.744
NARRATOR: <i>Fresh off writing
"There's a Great, Big, Beautiful Tomorrow"</i>

24:14.828 --> 24:17.414
<i>for the GE Carousel of Progress exhibit...</i>

24:17.497 --> 24:21.293
Richard and Robert Sherman say,
"What you really need is a round.

24:21.376 --> 24:26.298
You need to have everybody singing
the same song, but at different points.

24:26.381 --> 24:30.218
So, as you're riding
through this attraction on your boats,

24:30.302 --> 24:34.681
you're going to have these two pieces
of the melody interweaving."

24:34.764 --> 24:36.725
And so we came up with this little song.

24:36.808 --> 24:41.104
(Richard singing) <i>♪ It's a world
Of laughter, a world of tears ♪</i>

24:41.188 --> 24:44.649
<i>♪ It's a world of hopes
And a world of fears ♪</i>

24:44.733 --> 24:45.942
NARRATOR: <i>To which Walt said...</i>

24:46.026 --> 24:47.235
Well, it sounds pretty good.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.279
And they write "It's a Small World."

24:49.362 --> 24:51.364
And then after hearing
the Sherman Brothers' song,

24:51.448 --> 24:54.910
Walt decided that that, then,
should be the name for the attraction.

24:54.993 --> 24:58.413
NARRATOR: <i>So, with just weeks to go,
thanks to the Sherman Brothers,</i>

24:58.497 --> 25:02.876
<i>Pepsi, UNICEF, Mary Blair,
and, of course, the Imagineers,</i>

25:02.959 --> 25:06.338
<i>Walt Disney had, once again,
achieved the impossible.</i>

25:06.421 --> 25:09.049
The happiest cruise that ever sailed.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.301
NARRATOR:
<i>Creating something that would live on</i>

25:11.384 --> 25:14.137
<i>in the hearts of millions long
after the Fair.</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:16.640
Hope we have some good winds
back there in New York.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.391
NARRATOR: <i>But first,
they would have to live</i>

25:18.475 --> 25:21.561
<i>through the long drive to New York City</i>

25:21.645 --> 25:24.564
<i>Along with a massive truckload
of other attractions,</i>

25:24.648 --> 25:27.108
<i>whether they were ready or not.</i>

25:27.192 --> 25:29.694
-WALT: <i>And we're off to the Fair.</i>
-(truck horn honks)

25:31.655 --> 25:36.451
MAN 6: Welcome to the New York
World's Fair of 1964-'65.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.495
NARRATOR: <i>With over 140 pavilions,</i>

25:38.578 --> 25:41.748
<i>this extravaganza of spectacle
wasn't just about Walt.</i>

25:42.207 --> 25:46.211
<i>With over 140 pavilions,
the four Disney exhibits</i>

25:46.294 --> 25:49.923
<i>were scattered
throughout the 646-acre site.</i>

25:50.006 --> 25:53.385
<i>But it didn't take long for word
to spread that Walt Disney,</i>

25:53.468 --> 25:54.928
<i>the West Coast wizard,</i>

25:55.011 --> 25:57.889
<i>had put together
some pretty amazing things.</i>

25:57.973 --> 26:00.934
WALT: <i>The Magic Skyway takes you back
through the time barrier.</i>

26:01.017 --> 26:04.062
NARRATOR: <i>And, if you really liked it,
to the back of the line.</i>

26:04.145 --> 26:06.231
And everybody wanted to wait
to ride on the Mustangs

26:06.314 --> 26:07.357
because they were so cool.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.818
And they claimed
that the Magic Skyway ride

26:09.901 --> 26:12.195
is the favorite attraction
at the New York World's Fair.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.321
NARRATOR: <i>Maybe.</i>

26:13.405 --> 26:17.701
<i>But the GE exhibit over here,
the Carousel of Progress,</i>

26:17.784 --> 26:20.996
<i>was cranking crowds through
by the thousands,</i>

26:21.079 --> 26:23.832
<i>thanks to a revolutionary
rotating theater.</i>

26:23.915 --> 26:27.252
The audience is rotating around to get
these different show sets

26:27.335 --> 26:29.462
and at the same time we're able to load

26:29.546 --> 26:31.923
and give people
this intimate theater experience.

26:32.007 --> 26:32.841
But at the same time,

26:32.924 --> 26:35.969
we're loading thousands
of people an hour to get to see a show.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.430
I always thought that is such
an incredible breakthrough.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.974
NARRATOR: <i>The Carousel of Progress
was all about breakthroughs.</i>

26:41.057 --> 26:43.101
JOHN: <i>And isn't our new icebox a beauty?</i>

26:43.184 --> 26:45.353
<i>Milk doesn't sour as quick as it used to.</i>

26:45.812 --> 26:48.940
It's hard to imagine
how life could be any easier.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.108
NARRATOR: <i>Easy for some.</i>

26:50.191 --> 26:52.235
SARAH: I'll believe that when I see it.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.405
NARRATOR:
<i>And over here at the Illinois Pavilion,</i>

26:55.488 --> 26:59.326
<i>guests were ready to be wowed
by the great president brought to life.</i>

26:59.409 --> 27:01.828
<i>On April 29th, 1964...</i>

27:01.911 --> 27:02.954
MAN 7: Mr. Lincoln.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.540
NARRATOR:
<i>And the president's powerful words...</i>

27:05.624 --> 27:07.459
<i>um, powerful hydraulics legs.</i>

27:07.542 --> 27:12.589
<i>proved yet again that Walt Disney's ideas
were actually really good.</i>

27:12.672 --> 27:16.176
The final result is so lifelike
that you might find it hard to believe.

27:16.259 --> 27:19.679
Our reliance is in the love of liberty.

27:19.763 --> 27:23.391
NARRATOR: <i>And with that,
Walt's World's Fair frenzy was over,</i>

27:23.475 --> 27:28.146
<i>and his dream of developing
Audio-Animatronics creations had paid off.</i>

27:28.229 --> 27:31.483
Let us to the end dare to do our duty.

27:31.566 --> 27:34.444
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, wait. What's happening over here?</i>

27:34.527 --> 27:35.487
(laughing)

27:35.570 --> 27:37.322
<i>That's right! How could we forget?</i>

27:37.405 --> 27:39.199
<i>It's a Small World,</i>

27:39.449 --> 27:42.118
<i>arguably the biggest hit
of the World's Fair.</i>

27:43.036 --> 27:45.497
I remember being a very small girl

27:45.580 --> 27:49.834
and riding through
with all these beautiful dolls

27:49.918 --> 27:52.045
and beautiful costumes.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.880
I had never seen anything like it.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.840
NARRATOR: <i>And as the crowds flowed in,</i>

27:55.924 --> 27:59.177
<i>the team could finally kick back
and enjoy a well-earned...</i>

27:59.803 --> 28:00.679
Pepsi.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.764
NARRATOR: <i>And Pepsi was one happy sponsor.</i>

28:02.847 --> 28:04.349
Pepsi was very pleased with it.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.601
NARRATOR: <i>And so was Joan Crawford,
from the looks of it.</i>

28:06.685 --> 28:10.438
They were just so proud
to be part of It's a Small World.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.149
NARRATOR: <i>As well they should
with ten million visitors.</i>

28:13.233 --> 28:14.275
<i>If you remember...</i>

28:14.359 --> 28:17.612
The profits from this would go
to the charity UNICEF.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.824
NARRATOR: <i>And rightly so,
UNICEF and the children of the world</i>

28:20.907 --> 28:23.410
<i>were singing Walt and Pepsi's praise.</i>

28:23.493 --> 28:25.578
Everybody was talking
about It's a Small World.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.539
NARRATOR: <i>Well, more singing than talking.</i>

28:27.622 --> 28:28.748
Everybody loves the song.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.750
NARRATOR: <i>"Love" is a pretty strong word.</i>

28:30.834 --> 28:33.128
It's the first thing you hear
when you go in there.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.171
Over and over. Yes, indeedy.
(laughing)

28:35.255 --> 28:37.674
CAROLINE: <i>You know, sometimes
you see grown-ups getting in</i>

28:37.757 --> 28:40.677
with the children and saying,
"Yeah, but it's for the kids."

28:40.760 --> 28:42.387
CAROLINE: <i>And then when they get out,</i>

28:42.470 --> 28:45.890
they have the happy faces
and they're singing the song.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.142
They're enjoying it.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.228
But I think they're scared
it's stuck in the head.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.063
-(laughs)
-NARRATOR: <i>Well, why wouldn't it be?</i>

28:52.147 --> 28:55.066
<i>As one of the most
publicly performed songs ever,</i>

28:55.150 --> 29:00.697
<i>it's been played over 50 million times,
and probably will be 50 million more.</i>

29:00.780 --> 29:03.408
Come on. Let's get on board.
You will enjoy it.

29:03.491 --> 29:06.786
NARRATOR: <i>So, with the world watching,
by the end of the Fair,</i>

29:06.870 --> 29:09.122
<i>it was clear that Walt Disney</i>

29:09.205 --> 29:12.125
<i>had created four incredible attractions
that really met the moment.</i>

29:12.208 --> 29:18.047
<i>At least according
to a non-Audio-Animatronics president.</i>

29:18.131 --> 29:22.010
This Fair represents
the most promising of our hopes.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.763
It gathers together from 80 countries

29:24.846 --> 29:28.975
the achievements of industry,
the health of nations,

29:29.058 --> 29:30.727
the creations of man.

29:30.810 --> 29:33.688
This Fair shows us what man,

29:33.772 --> 29:39.402
at his most creative and constructive,
is capable of doing.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.446
(cheering)

29:41.529 --> 29:42.947
NARRATOR: <i>But it's what Walt Disney</i>

29:43.031 --> 29:46.868
<i>was capable of doing next
that's truly impressive.</i>

29:46.951 --> 29:48.870
And when the current World's Fair ends,

29:48.953 --> 29:53.541
all four of our shows will find
a permanent home at Disneyland USA.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.584
(horn honks)

29:54.667 --> 29:57.128
NARRATOR:
<i>After years of putting Disneyland on ice,</i>

29:57.212 --> 30:00.131
<i>not like that, the park
was about to be inundated</i>

30:00.215 --> 30:02.967
<i>with new attractions fresh from the Fair.</i>

30:03.051 --> 30:05.011
Now we had to bring them back
to California.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.846
-NARRATOR: <i>Aha! Bring them home?</i>
-Bring them home.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.139
NARRATOR: <i>Back to Disneyland.</i>

30:08.223 --> 30:09.140
Oh, yeah.

30:09.224 --> 30:14.270
Okay. Now, delivering on that promise
to bring an attraction back to Disneyland.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.774
NARRATOR: <i>So, the trucks rolled home,
leaving the big city...</i>

30:17.857 --> 30:18.691
So long!

30:18.775 --> 30:21.694
<i>...and Robert Moses to clean up,
like only he could.</i>

30:23.363 --> 30:25.740
NARRATOR: <i>Back in California
as they unpacked...</i>

30:25.824 --> 30:28.076
Lincoln was in what we called his coffin.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.662
NARRATOR: <i>It quickly became obvious
that if they planned</i>

30:30.745 --> 30:34.123
<i>to have hundreds of tiny children singing
in an infinite loop</i>

30:34.207 --> 30:35.959
<i>for the next century or more,</i>

30:36.042 --> 30:40.046
<i>they might wanna transition
to something a little bit less artisanal</i>

30:40.129 --> 30:43.132
<i>than the handmade parts
they had been using at the Fair,</i>

30:43.216 --> 30:44.717
<i>because quite simply...</i>

30:44.801 --> 30:48.346
You can't wait for several days to have
that figure back up if it broke.

30:48.429 --> 30:49.639
NARRATOR: <i>And so...</i>

30:49.722 --> 30:53.226
Everything from the World's Fair
were rehabbed and modified.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.228
NARRATOR: <i>Hmm, modifications, eh?</i>

30:55.311 --> 30:56.396
Oh, yes.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.982
NARRATOR: <i>But it didn't end there,
because a young Wayne Jackson</i>

30:59.065 --> 31:02.861
<i>was given a very special task
by Walt Disney himself.</i>

31:02.944 --> 31:06.781
Walt had requested, instead of them
being handmade parts,

31:06.865 --> 31:09.951
<i>which they had done for the World's Fair,
he wanted it like a car...</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:11.035
NARRATOR: <i>No, not Lincoln.</i>

31:11.119 --> 31:15.290
...where you could replace that part
without having to have it manufactured.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.417
NARRATOR: <i>So Wayne and the crew
started coming up</i>

31:17.500 --> 31:21.880
<i>with a standard system for all
Disney Audio-Animatronics figures.</i>

31:21.963 --> 31:23.715
They were all given part numbers.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.968
WAYNE:
<i>Uh, your A-1, hydraulic humanoid figures.</i>

31:27.051 --> 31:30.930
A-2 was animals. A-3 was Small World.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.181
NARRATOR: <i>And the list goes on...</i>

31:32.265 --> 31:34.058
A-5 were your dinosaurs
and Jungle Cruise figures.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.353
NARRATOR: <i>...and on. But thanks
to these innovations,</i>

31:37.437 --> 31:40.815
<i>so do all these tiny children
singing joyously</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:44.736
<i>in an infinite loop
of harmonious mechanical repairability.</i>

31:46.195 --> 31:47.906
<i>However, with Wayne on the case,</i>

31:47.989 --> 31:50.867
<i>the inside of these
Audio-Animatronics dolls</i>

31:50.950 --> 31:52.493
<i>were the least of Walt's worries,</i>

31:52.619 --> 31:56.831
<i>because when it came time to think
about the outside of the new attraction,</i>

31:56.915 --> 31:58.625
<i>Walt once again asked...</i>

31:58.708 --> 31:59.959
"What's Mary Blair doing?"

32:00.043 --> 32:03.796
NARRATOR: <i>The attraction had been
inside the Pepsi Pavilion at the Fair.</i>

32:03.880 --> 32:06.883
<i>But now, Walt needed a special building
of his own</i>

32:06.966 --> 32:08.426
<i>to house this special attraction.</i>

32:08.509 --> 32:13.473
He wanted Mary to design the facade
of... of Small World.

32:13.556 --> 32:15.224
ROLLY: <i>She tried to think
like a little girl</i>

32:15.308 --> 32:17.393
<i>and build these little buildings
with blocks</i>

32:17.477 --> 32:20.772
because that's what she did in her head
while she's drawing it.

32:20.855 --> 32:25.276
But if you do it in a model,
no, it won't... No, that doesn't work.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.906
<i>I knew... I knew that when Walt
was unhappy about something,</i>

32:29.989 --> 32:31.115
<i>he'd tap his fingers.</i>

32:32.992 --> 32:35.787
Uh-oh, he's tapping his fingers.
We're in trouble.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.873
And so... but he would never say,
"I don't like that."

32:39.332 --> 32:42.001
He'd always say,
"Why don't we try it another way?"

32:42.502 --> 32:44.671
And that pretty much said, "That's it."

32:44.963 --> 32:45.922
Bye.

32:46.214 --> 32:50.510
So, she knew they didn't buy off on her.
So she went home and never came back.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.137
Really! She never came back.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.015
NARRATOR: <i>Heading home
to give retirement another go,</i>

32:56.099 --> 32:59.060
<i>Mary Blair left behind an artistic legacy</i>

32:59.143 --> 33:02.772
<i>with It's a Small World
that has inspired generations.</i>

33:02.855 --> 33:06.317
And I inherited the whole thing.
And I didn't have any problem with that

33:06.401 --> 33:09.612
<i>because I loved her dearly
and we worked together for three years.</i>

33:10.905 --> 33:14.075
I knew how to take her work
and make it look dimensional.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.952
ROLLY: <i>But my philosophy was,</i>

33:16.035 --> 33:19.163
<i>"We've got to keep it look
like Mary Blair no matter what we do."</i>

33:19.664 --> 33:23.209
She's a great storyteller,
and she does it through art.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.921
She expresses,
uh, what Imagineering is all about.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.214
NARRATOR: <i>So, with Mary gone,</i>

33:28.297 --> 33:30.925
<i>that left Rolly
to answer Walt's question...</i>

33:31.009 --> 33:34.178
"What are you gonna put in front?"
And I said, "God, I don't know."

33:36.139 --> 33:37.557
He said, "Well, how about a clock?"

33:37.807 --> 33:43.646
And the clock was one of the major issues.
You know, that was a big item.

33:43.730 --> 33:47.984
The certain items have to go in
as the buildings were being built.

33:48.151 --> 33:51.487
NARRATOR: <i>And so, with the weight
of this Herculean task</i>

33:51.571 --> 33:56.284
<i>resting solely on his shoulders,
a determined Rolly buckled down and...</i>

33:56.367 --> 33:58.661
I immediately got on the phone
and called Mary Blair.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.496
-(telephone ringing)
-NARRATOR: <i>Of course he did.</i>

34:00.580 --> 34:02.957
She did this gorgeous
little scratch drawing.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.710
ROLLY: <i>And I built a model on it
just like the sketch.</i>

34:05.793 --> 34:09.380
It's the most unique musical timepiece
ever created.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.424
NARRATOR:
<i>And thanks to Rolly, Mary Blair's</i>

34:11.507 --> 34:16.929
<i>beautiful iconic designs will live on
in five Disney Parks around the world</i>

34:17.013 --> 34:20.349
<i>as a symbol of goodness
and all things Disney.</i>

34:20.433 --> 34:23.394
<i>Now, as for the other exhibits
from the World's Fair,</i>

34:23.478 --> 34:28.357
<i>well, they all exist to this day
in one form or another</i>

34:28.441 --> 34:30.693
<i>in Disney Parks around the world.</i>

34:30.777 --> 34:33.529
<i>For example, you can find Mr. Lincoln</i>

34:33.613 --> 34:37.366
<i>just inside the entrance
to Disneyland on Main Street, USA,</i>

34:37.450 --> 34:40.411
<i>still standing proud as the realization</i>

34:40.495 --> 34:43.039
<i>of Audio-Animatronics
technology personified.</i>

34:43.122 --> 34:45.083
(singing) <i>♪ There's a great, big
Beautiful tomorrow ♪</i>

34:45.166 --> 34:47.335
NARRATOR:
<i>Now, as for the Carousel of Progress,</i>

34:47.418 --> 34:48.920
<i>after opening in Anaheim,</i>

34:49.003 --> 34:53.716
<i>it found a permanent home in Florida's
Walt Disneyworld in 1975</i>

34:53.800 --> 34:55.218
<i>and, despite its many updates,</i>

34:55.301 --> 35:00.306
<i>remains the longest-running stage show
in the history of American theater.</i>

35:00.389 --> 35:02.517
And it was using multiple technologies

35:02.600 --> 35:04.894
within a single attraction
to tell a story.

35:04.977 --> 35:08.064
Yeah, it was the Rise
of the Resistance of its time.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.483
NARRATOR: <i>How about the Ford Magic Skyway?</i>

35:10.566 --> 35:12.276
It was supposed to be
for the new Tomorrowland

35:12.360 --> 35:14.862
that Disneyland was planning for 1967.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.697
NARRATOR: <i>But instead,
the concept developed</i>

35:16.781 --> 35:18.574
<i>to move around those Mustangs</i>

35:18.658 --> 35:22.203
<i>was deployed
on many Disney transit projects.</i>

35:22.286 --> 35:24.705
<i>And the Audio-Animatronics dinosaurs?</i>

35:24.789 --> 35:29.085
<i>They found a permanent home here
as part of the Disneyland Railroad.</i>

35:29.168 --> 35:31.963
Not a bad compromise in the end.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.924
NARRATOR: <i>But for Walt Disney,
it wasn't about compromise,</i>

35:35.007 --> 35:37.885
<i>it was always about developing technology.</i>

35:38.261 --> 35:40.638
<i>And what the World's Fair unlocked
for Disneyland</i>

35:40.721 --> 35:42.849
<i>was really only just the beginning.</i>

35:42.932 --> 35:45.268
WALT: <i>The world
has come a long way since then.</i>

35:45.351 --> 35:47.854
After that first human was built,

35:48.396 --> 35:50.481
there's an appetite to build
a lot more of these.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.607
NARRATOR: <i>And they did.</i>

35:51.691 --> 35:53.484
<i>Audio-Animatronics technology</i>

35:53.568 --> 35:56.529
<i>quickly became a huge part
of future projects.</i>

35:56.946 --> 36:00.992
<i>Two years after the World's Fair,
Pirates of the Caribbean opened,</i>

36:01.075 --> 36:05.538
<i>containing dozens
of A-1 Audio-Animatronics figures</i>

36:05.621 --> 36:08.457
<i>and a flume system lifted straight</i>

36:08.541 --> 36:11.711
<i>from the technology developed
for It's a Small World.</i>

36:11.794 --> 36:15.214
That ride system really evolved
into Pirates of the Caribbean.

36:15.506 --> 36:19.927
Pirates were the first A-1 figures
that were operated in the park.

36:20.011 --> 36:23.181
NARRATOR: <i>Rolly finally got back
to work on The Haunted Mansion.</i>

36:23.264 --> 36:24.515
Gonna have man-eating plants,

36:24.599 --> 36:27.768
and we're gonna have a coffin clock here
that we're working on right now.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.687
ROLLY: <i>I mean, you know,
the building was there,</i>

36:29.770 --> 36:32.523
but nothing had been designed
to be inside of it.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.775
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, now they knew just what to do.</i>

36:34.859 --> 36:37.528
WAYNE: <i>The A-6
were The Haunted Mansion figures.</i>

36:37.612 --> 36:42.491
All of the actuators were operated by air
rather than by hydraulics.

36:42.783 --> 36:44.202
NARRATOR: <i>In the years that followed,</i>

36:44.285 --> 36:47.997
<i>Disney's Audio-Animatronics
creations continued to advance.</i>

36:48.080 --> 36:52.168
All of their steps and processes
that they had invented through all of this

36:52.627 --> 36:54.587
is very much what we use today.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.923
We were able
to create three-dimensional figures

36:57.006 --> 37:00.009
<i>that really do tell stories
and really have personality.</i>

37:00.092 --> 37:01.636
BOB: <i>They now have an A-1000.</i>

37:01.719 --> 37:03.554
To transport this valuable merchandise...

37:03.638 --> 37:06.265
What it does now is... is fantastic.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.767
We've... we've grown drastically,

37:07.850 --> 37:10.853
both in the mechanical side
and then especially in that control side.

37:10.937 --> 37:14.106
Now we're able to use software's

37:14.190 --> 37:17.401
where we can pre-visualize what the motion
is going to be.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.320
TANNER: <i>The auctioneer in Pirates,</i>

37:19.403 --> 37:21.572
those have something
like 40 or 50 functions.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.574
The Shaman had 81 functions.

37:23.658 --> 37:29.121
That face and performance
and expression and what she... amazing.

37:33.501 --> 37:37.088
NARRATOR:
<i>What happened at the '64-'65 World's Fair</i>

37:37.171 --> 37:41.550
<i>had a lasting impact on what Walt Disney
was able to offer the world</i>

37:41.634 --> 37:45.221
<i>before he passed away just over a year
after the Fair ended,</i>

37:45.763 --> 37:49.392
<i>leaving Disneyland in the hands

38:54.874 --> 38:57.418
<i>they, almost as an afterthought,</i>

38:57.501 --> 39:00.755

39:06.052 --> 39:07.011
Yeah.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.931
Well, it gives you a lot of pride.

39:11.182 --> 39:15.019
NARRATOR: <i>But mostly because the message
of It's a Small World</i>

39:15.102 --> 39:17.980
<i>resonates as much today as ever.</i>

39:18.606 --> 39:21.859
It's not that long after the war.

PAULA: <i>It's not that long
after nuclear development.</i>

39:26.238 --> 39:31.952
And what they're saying in the words is,
it's just one moon, just one sun.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.330
And a smile brings friendship to everyone.

39:34.413 --> 39:38.793

39:45.049 --> 39:46.634
It doesn't matter. We're all human.

We're all human beings.
We're all the same.

CARMEN: <i>We share so much.</i>
