WEBVTT

00:18.650 --> 00:20.652
(WHINING)

00:49.686 --> 00:53.857
The late Mr MacDonald
made a number of wills.

00:53.941 --> 00:57.779
In the latest,
he wrote out the bequests

00:57.862 --> 01:01.158
on separate
sheets in his own hand,

01:01.242 --> 01:04.745
which he was keen for
you to read yourselves.

01:05.370 --> 01:08.083
I'll...

01:08.166 --> 01:13.005
"To my liegeman Golly,
as true a man as
I've ever known,

01:13.089 --> 01:16.509
"I leave what remains
of my once mighty collection

01:16.592 --> 01:20.097
"of single malt
whiskies in the hope that

01:20.180 --> 01:23.600
"he will toast our association
every St Andrew's Day."

01:25.144 --> 01:27.105
That I will, Hector.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.356
(CLEARING THROAT)

01:28.439 --> 01:31.902
"To my assistant gillie
and court jester Duncan,

01:31.986 --> 01:35.197
"I leave the entire
contents of my wardrobe

01:35.281 --> 01:36.992
"in the hope that this may
encourage him to wear

01:37.075 --> 01:40.704
something other
than that filthy...

01:40.787 --> 01:44.624
"kilt and moth eaten cardigan
he insists on
donning every day."

01:44.709 --> 01:47.253
It's not a cardie,
it's a fleece.

01:48.755 --> 01:50.881
I paid eight quid for that.

01:55.346 --> 01:59.851
"To the estimable Alexandra
I bequeath a sufficient sum

01:59.935 --> 02:02.563
"for a new set of saucepans,

02:02.646 --> 02:08.360
"the remainder to be spent on
garments that expose her even
more estimable midriff."

02:11.823 --> 02:16.287
"To my darling wife,
best friend
and good companion Molly,

02:16.370 --> 02:19.333
"I bequeath the rest
of my goods and effects,

02:19.416 --> 02:22.794
"as well as my ridiculously
puny personal holdings

02:22.878 --> 02:27.133
"in the hope that
they will help her
to become a very merry widow."

02:27.217 --> 02:31.222
And now we come
to the tricky part.

02:31.305 --> 02:36.561
"To my only son, Archie,
I have already gifted
the ancestral lands,

02:36.645 --> 02:39.022
"house and
waters of Glenbogle,

02:39.105 --> 02:43.194
"a sacred trust to which
I hope he will adhere with
every fibre of his being."

02:46.989 --> 02:49.618
Why is that the tricky part?

02:49.701 --> 02:53.705
The law states that to avoid
the payment of death duties,

02:53.789 --> 02:56.876
a period of seven
years must elapse

02:56.960 --> 03:03.217
from the date of
the deed of gift
to the demise of the donor.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.763
In this case,
seven years have not elapsed.

03:06.846 --> 03:09.224
I think I somehow
know what's coming.

03:09.307 --> 03:14.105
I would say that
you owe HM Treasury
something in the region of

03:15.773 --> 03:17.901
Â£200,000.

03:20.445 --> 03:21.446
Hmm.

03:23.198 --> 03:25.493
Oh, thank you, God.

03:26.703 --> 03:28.162
Thank you, Father.

04:20.432 --> 04:21.850
Hi.

04:24.145 --> 04:25.604
Are you okay?

04:27.732 --> 04:30.819
We must be strong, Lexie,
for the men in our lives.

04:30.903 --> 04:36.117
I must be strong for Hector
and you must be
strong for Archie.

04:36.201 --> 04:39.454
-I'll try.
-He may look as if
he's coping but...

04:54.055 --> 04:56.099
-What do we do now, Lexie?
-Duncan, shh.

04:56.182 --> 04:58.560
It's all right.

04:58.643 --> 05:02.690
Thank you all so much for
being here to welcome Hector
home for the last time.

05:02.773 --> 05:05.819
-Least we can do, old girl.
-Thank you, Jo.

05:05.902 --> 05:09.406
But Duncan's
question is a good one,
what do we do now?

05:10.574 --> 05:13.911
Well, there's
an easy answer to that.

05:13.995 --> 05:17.707
The king is dead.
Long live the king.

05:17.791 --> 05:22.170
Archie, darling,
we'll mourn your father
and show him every respect,

05:22.254 --> 05:27.343
but you must go ahead with
your plans to make Glenbogle
a great place once more.

05:27.427 --> 05:31.515
That's the best memorial
your father could ever have.

05:31.599 --> 05:35.352
But I also think
that you should
go ahead with the wedding.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.940
There's been death,
yes, but there's also love.

05:39.024 --> 05:42.737
-Oh, Molly,
I don't think it's right.
-No, no.

05:42.820 --> 05:46.616
You're right, Mother,
we must go ahead as planned.

05:49.411 --> 05:52.080
LEXIE:
So, this is where he died?

05:53.582 --> 05:57.587
I hadn't seen it up till now.
I kind of wish I hadn't.

06:00.633 --> 06:03.969
It's ugly, isn't it?

06:04.053 --> 06:07.599
The minister phoned.
He's gonna come
round and see us.

06:10.310 --> 06:11.394
Okay?

06:12.230 --> 06:14.899
Yeah, I'm fine. You?

06:17.652 --> 06:19.655
Well, it just doesn't
seem right, does it?

06:19.738 --> 06:23.408
Getting married
just a couple of days
after Hector...

06:23.492 --> 06:28.790
Look, getting married is the
one certainty, the one good
thing that we have.

06:28.873 --> 06:33.879
-You take that away and...
-Okay. I understand.

06:36.716 --> 06:40.345
Look, I better get going.
Are you coming?

06:40.428 --> 06:42.974
There's something
I have to do first.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.627
I don't really want to
wear black to the funeral.

07:07.711 --> 07:11.674
I suppose I could wear this.

07:11.757 --> 07:15.678
Is there anything I can do,
anything at all,
in the interim?

07:15.761 --> 07:18.515
Well, you could look
after Pammie, Lexie's mother.

07:18.599 --> 07:22.394
She's a bit full-on and I'm
not sure that I can cope
with her just now.

07:22.477 --> 07:25.356
Still, when you're
spectacularly rich,

07:25.440 --> 07:27.942
I suppose you can be
as "full" or as
"on" as you like.

07:28.026 --> 07:31.280
Leave her to me, Molly.
I'll take care of Pammie.

07:34.158 --> 07:36.036
Went to London,

07:36.119 --> 07:39.664
did some serious
damage to Eric's credit card
in South Molton Street.

07:39.748 --> 07:44.211
Got this. Shantung silk.
Feel that. And this.

07:44.295 --> 07:49.593
Is that not a gorgeous colour?
And I don't know,
hat or hairpiece?

07:49.676 --> 07:52.387
Can't decide.
What do you think?

07:52.471 --> 07:56.184
Er, simple is good, Mum.
As restrained as
you can manage.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.980
Never mind me,
what are you wearing?

08:00.064 --> 08:03.067
Oh, I don't know. I've
not even thought about it.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.821
I won't be going out and
buying anything new,
now that Archie's so broke.

08:06.905 --> 08:09.950
Och, let me buy you a frock.
Let me take
care of everything.

08:10.033 --> 08:14.372
-That's what mothers are for.
-Okay, okay, okay.
Thanks, Mum.

08:14.455 --> 08:20.087
Well, what do you think?
What do you think about that?

08:20.170 --> 08:24.801
-You're not gonna wear that,
though, are you?
-Yeah. What's wrong with it?

08:24.884 --> 08:27.929
Do you not think
it's a wee bit on
the gloomy side?

08:28.012 --> 08:31.392
It's for the funeral,
Mum, not the wedding.

08:31.475 --> 08:32.851
Very nice.

08:36.106 --> 08:39.484
I just,
well, thought I would cook.
It's just some tomato soup.

08:39.567 --> 08:42.113
Just to, um,
keep everyone's strength up.

08:45.241 --> 08:46.659
Where's Archie?

08:46.742 --> 08:50.163
Erm, well, he just had to go
and sort something out.

08:50.247 --> 08:52.040
DUNCAN: This is great, though.

08:54.042 --> 08:57.088
-Molly?
-I'm not really
very hungry, dear.

08:58.965 --> 09:02.303
It smells absolutely delicious

09:02.385 --> 09:07.267
but somehow I...
I don't know, it doesn't
seem quite right to eat it.

09:09.561 --> 09:13.649
Pamela, if we're to be pals,
I think you should know that

09:13.733 --> 09:17.654
Noel Coward was
my absolute hero.

09:17.738 --> 09:22.451
Erm, towards the end of his
life, he was sitting with
his special friend,

09:22.534 --> 09:25.997
and it was after dinner,
they were gazing
out over the Med,

09:26.080 --> 09:30.919
and they were talking about
what would happen
if one of them died,

09:31.003 --> 09:32.880
how the other would cope.

09:32.963 --> 09:36.926
And his friend said,
"Well, supposing I
should die tonight,

09:37.010 --> 09:41.222
"what would
happen in the morning?
Would you take breakfast?"

09:41.306 --> 09:45.811
And Coward ruminated
for a moment and he said,

09:45.895 --> 09:48.315
"Breakfast, probably not.

09:48.398 --> 09:53.403
"But I think I'd be
pretty damn peckish
by lunch time."

09:58.868 --> 10:02.790
Do you know, Jolyon,
that's really rather good.

10:07.587 --> 10:09.089
Thank you, Jo.

10:11.509 --> 10:13.177
Thank you, Lexie.

10:14.261 --> 10:15.262
Duncan?

10:17.766 --> 10:18.767
Eat.

11:05.029 --> 11:08.116
Golly,
what are you doing here?

11:11.621 --> 11:16.834
-I just thought
I'd sit with him.
-A vigil. Mind if I join you?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.088
I'd be honoured, Molly.

11:36.566 --> 11:37.692
Oh, dear.

11:42.740 --> 11:46.202
You know how I came
to work here, Molly?

11:46.285 --> 11:49.498
Well, it was
a family thing, wasn't it?

11:49.581 --> 11:53.001
Your father worked
here and his father
before him and so on?

11:53.085 --> 11:57.924
Hector didn't tell
you the...story, no?

11:58.007 --> 11:59.008
No.

12:01.303 --> 12:06.184
Well, to begin
with when I was a boy

12:07.727 --> 12:09.646
I was a bit of a tearaway.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.191
Really?

12:12.274 --> 12:18.156
Didn't get on with my dad.
A hard, unbending man.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.160
Used to knock me about,
especially when
the drink was on him.

12:23.621 --> 12:25.623
Anyway, he...

12:25.707 --> 12:30.462
When I left school he
got me a place here,
but I didn't want that.

12:32.423 --> 12:35.175
Under his thumb,
under his fist all day.

12:37.554 --> 12:42.727
So what I did is I
took a silver tankard
from the dining room.

12:44.478 --> 12:47.941
I hid it in my
bedroom so that...

12:48.025 --> 12:51.028
Well, I made sure that
my father would find it

12:51.111 --> 12:54.907
and haul me up in
front of Hector's dad,

12:56.159 --> 12:59.078
which he did.

12:59.162 --> 13:04.001
And I got the push.
And then my
father kicked me out.

13:05.127 --> 13:07.547
So I...

13:07.630 --> 13:12.553
I was disgraced but
I was free of him.

13:14.013 --> 13:16.515
So how...?

13:16.599 --> 13:20.187
Well,
I lived in a caravan, Molly,
worked on the roads.

13:21.355 --> 13:23.566
Took to the bottle big time.

13:24.859 --> 13:26.319
I was a mess.

13:28.237 --> 13:32.034
And meanwhile
Hector's dad pegged out,

13:32.117 --> 13:34.828
so Hector became the laird.

13:37.957 --> 13:39.959
And then my father went.

13:42.171 --> 13:44.548
He was carrying
a stag he'd shot

13:46.676 --> 13:49.262
and he just collapsed.

13:49.346 --> 13:52.140
Heart attack.

13:52.224 --> 13:54.894
He was dead before
he hit the heather.

13:58.106 --> 14:02.069
Anyway,
at the funeral, Hector...

14:04.488 --> 14:06.533
offered me my dad's job.

14:08.451 --> 14:09.661
Me.

14:12.289 --> 14:15.251
A thief and an outcast.

14:19.506 --> 14:22.259
He knew, Molly, he knew.

14:25.888 --> 14:29.393
I don't think I'd be here now
if he hadn't done that.

14:30.978 --> 14:32.646
He saved my life.

14:37.319 --> 14:39.863
Underneath all that daftness,

14:43.075 --> 14:44.910
he was a great man.

14:49.791 --> 14:52.127
I'm so sorry I
wasn't with him.

14:57.342 --> 15:00.054
I'll be sorry till
the end of my days.

15:12.651 --> 15:15.321
Arch?

15:15.404 --> 15:20.494
Look at the state of you.
You look as if you've
fallen down the chimney.

15:20.577 --> 15:25.291
Erm,
I'm sorry about the minister.
I got a bit carried away.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.418
-Is it all done?
-Mmm.

15:28.795 --> 15:31.674
-Archie, look, your hands.
-I'm okay.

15:33.384 --> 15:34.843
Are you sure?

15:37.430 --> 15:40.016
So what were you
doing up there?

15:40.100 --> 15:43.521
Were you filling in a hole
or burying your feelings?

15:46.399 --> 15:47.859
I'll be fine.

15:49.569 --> 15:53.282
After tomorrow, the funeral,

15:53.366 --> 15:59.415
and then we can get on
with the rest of our lives,
and the wedding.

15:59.498 --> 16:02.543
-Archie, are you sure?
-Absolutely, utterly.

16:06.047 --> 16:09.134
How are you coping
with your mother?

16:09.217 --> 16:12.763
Well, she's still
set on the pageboys.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.559
I had to put my foot down
at the symphony orchestra.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.937
Spoilsport.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.607
It kind of feels as if
she's getting
married and not me.

16:28.448 --> 16:29.783
I love you.

16:41.797 --> 16:46.635
I hope it's better than
that blended
muck in the library.

16:46.719 --> 16:49.139
Well, I didn't notice you
complain when you'd
finished the bottle.

16:49.222 --> 16:51.183
-Now look here...
-Shh!

16:57.065 --> 17:01.362
Hector kept this for
very special occasions.

17:03.072 --> 17:04.573
(JO LAUGHING)

17:04.656 --> 17:09.913
By the rivers of Babylon.
It's Highland Park.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.583
Orkney, '52.

17:12.665 --> 17:16.337
I remember we had a nip
when that ghastly Thatcher
woman was blackballed.

17:16.420 --> 17:18.214
You're not, you're
not suggesting...?

17:18.298 --> 17:20.384
Well,
nobody else knows about it.

17:20.467 --> 17:22.844
Poor old Hector
can't exactly...

17:22.928 --> 17:26.723
Perhaps if we
drink to his honour.

17:28.768 --> 17:30.688
Yes, that's it.

17:30.771 --> 17:33.816
-We're drinking
it for him really.
-Yes, yes.

17:33.899 --> 17:39.030
Spare me a tryst with Pamela,
the cook's wealthy mater.

17:39.114 --> 17:40.907
What? You got me confused.

17:40.990 --> 17:43.119
I thought you were mounting
an expeditionary
force on that front.

17:43.202 --> 17:46.372
Well, perhaps I am
but it's been
a guiding principle of my life

17:46.454 --> 17:51.044
always to put
pleasure before business.

17:52.421 --> 17:55.925
That sounds like
someone else I used to know.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.301
BOTH: Hector.

18:55.995 --> 18:58.539
So much for my inheritance,
Hector.

19:11.138 --> 19:13.891
This is most kind of you.

19:15.184 --> 19:17.396
Judging by the narrowness
of this waistline,

19:17.479 --> 19:20.649
I reckon you
must have worn these
when you were about 12.

19:20.732 --> 19:23.694
1972.

19:24.445 --> 19:26.531
Oh.

19:26.614 --> 19:30.244
It must have been a big rabbit
you pulled out of that hat.

19:30.327 --> 19:34.373
What was it, the gig?
Children's party? Panto?

19:36.459 --> 19:41.632
I was her Britannic Majesty's
Military Attache in Khartoum.

19:43.592 --> 19:45.886
No, please, don't tease.

19:45.970 --> 19:49.349
My head is going round
like a fairground organ.

19:49.433 --> 19:52.978
Well, serves you right
for standing me up last night.

19:53.062 --> 19:57.567
I told you I was bringing
comfort and succour to my
grieving sister.

19:57.650 --> 20:00.571
Aye, right. You were probably
under a table somewhere.

20:00.654 --> 20:01.697
Mmm.

20:02.573 --> 20:04.658
Thank you.

20:04.742 --> 20:08.997
Nice bod, Jolyon.
Nice manly pair of pins.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.168
My wee Eric, he may be rich
but see him
without his chinos,

20:12.251 --> 20:14.754
he looks like
an underfed chicken.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.385
So, next time, Cary Grant,

20:20.469 --> 20:24.307
make sure it's me
that gets
the comfort and succour, eh?

21:01.100 --> 21:04.061
Are you ready?
We're getting a bit late.

21:11.153 --> 21:14.323
-DUNCAN: Are you all right?
-You hadn't
harnessed these properly.

21:14.407 --> 21:17.661
-Golly, I had.
-Budge up.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.204
-What?
-Budge up.

21:24.544 --> 21:28.840
Give your face a holiday.
I was driving horses
before you were born.

21:34.346 --> 21:35.598
Walk on.

22:00.043 --> 22:01.044
Easy.

22:09.888 --> 22:12.808
Whoa. Whoa.

22:15.311 --> 22:17.272
That's it, good boys.

22:19.816 --> 22:22.569
-What's up?
-Just checking the coffin.

22:22.652 --> 22:24.864
-I already did that.
-Exactly.

22:44.512 --> 22:47.474
And how's
the work experience going
anyway, lads?

22:48.725 --> 22:50.185
And what happens now, like?

22:50.268 --> 22:51.812
(BELLS TOLLING)

23:16.215 --> 23:19.261
Trust Hector to be
late for his own funeral.

23:20.637 --> 23:21.638
Ah.

23:24.976 --> 23:26.519
What in heaven?

24:01.727 --> 24:06.816
Hector Naismith MacDonald
was very possibly
the most stubborn,

24:07.901 --> 24:10.069
the most irritating,

24:10.153 --> 24:14.325
the most maddening laird
in the history of lairddom.

24:15.534 --> 24:17.329
Quite a distinction.

24:19.456 --> 24:21.875
He was also my friend.

24:24.378 --> 24:28.424
# The Lord's my Shepherd

24:28.508 --> 24:31.428
# I'll not want

24:31.512 --> 24:38.019
# He makes me down to lie

24:38.103 --> 24:44.777
# In pastures green;
He leadeth me... #

24:47.030 --> 24:49.074
ARCHIE:
I'm going to read a poem.

24:50.534 --> 24:52.995
Which, judging by
the thumb marks in this book,

24:53.079 --> 24:56.582
must have been one of
my father's favourites.

24:56.666 --> 24:58.501
But then...

24:58.584 --> 25:00.087
I'm only just
beginning to realise

25:00.170 --> 25:03.257
that there was a
lot more to my father
than met the eye.

25:06.136 --> 25:08.179
And I wonder what could,

25:08.263 --> 25:12.893
and should, have been
spoken of between us
but now never will.

25:16.230 --> 25:19.818
"O ye whose cheek
the tear of pity stains

25:22.195 --> 25:25.741
"Draw near with pious
reverence and attend..."

25:27.326 --> 25:29.997
I'd like you to hear
a piece of music that is,

25:30.080 --> 25:34.961
was, very dear to
Hector and myself,

25:35.044 --> 25:39.716
and it's how I'd like to
remember my husband, with
a lively spring in his step.

25:44.680 --> 25:47.309
(LOVE IS
THE SWEETEST THING PLAYING)

26:27.522 --> 26:30.025
I won't be a moment.
I'm all right.

26:40.746 --> 26:43.916
Why did you have to
rush off like that?

26:43.999 --> 26:45.960
(USELESS BARKING)

26:46.043 --> 26:50.132
Oh, Useless.
Useless. Where have you been?

26:50.215 --> 26:52.384
Oh, you sweet little thing.

26:53.219 --> 26:54.637
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

26:55.972 --> 26:57.265
Thank you.

27:03.397 --> 27:05.150
Goodbye, my friend.

27:13.659 --> 27:14.952
Good dog.

27:38.813 --> 27:42.693
ARCHIE: Thank you all for
helping Lexie and I prepare
for our special day.

27:42.776 --> 27:47.240
As you know, we only have a
few hours to get the house
ready so let's get to work.

27:47.324 --> 27:50.660
Any questions,
just come and see me.

27:50.744 --> 27:54.665
Aye, she'll make somebody
a lovely
mother-in-law one day.

27:54.749 --> 27:58.169
No, no, no, no, I told you,
luncheon's to be
served in the ballroom.

27:58.252 --> 28:01.089
-Yeah, but...
-No buts. Back you go.

28:01.173 --> 28:04.426
-Ah, ah.
Now, where are you going?
-Well, she says to put...

28:04.510 --> 28:06.554
Useless men. We decided,
didn't we, darling,

28:06.638 --> 28:08.598
that we should all hog
down in the ballroom?

28:08.681 --> 28:11.560
No, we didn't. You decided.

28:11.644 --> 28:14.814
I want
the reception through there.
Now take it back through.

28:14.897 --> 28:18.485
But the ballroom's such a nice
room. And you know what they
say, mothers know best.

28:18.568 --> 28:22.197
-No. Well, my mother doesn't.
-Don't be ungracious, dearie.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.992
Just don't forget
who's putting their hand
in their pocket for all this.

28:25.076 --> 28:28.538
-Ah, now listen to me.
Don't you start...
-Preparations all in hand?

28:28.622 --> 28:31.333
Yeah, yeah.
They're fine, Molly, thanks.

28:31.416 --> 28:33.168
Good, good.

28:33.252 --> 28:36.339
I'm sorry I
haven't been able to help
but I'm... I'm not feeling...

28:36.422 --> 28:38.466
Do you want me to get
you anything, Molly, or...

28:38.550 --> 28:40.135
No, not really.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.973
It will be lovely
to hear laughter
in the house again.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.519
Now, where were we?

28:47.602 --> 28:52.149
Look, just do what you want.
I mean, that's what
you're gonna do anyway.

28:56.154 --> 28:58.657
(SOBBING) Oh, dear.

28:58.740 --> 29:01.451
Oh, dear. Hector.

29:02.661 --> 29:04.329
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

29:04.413 --> 29:07.792
-JOLYON:
Molly, are you in there?
-No.

29:07.876 --> 29:10.044
Well, I hope you're
decent 'cause I'm coming in.

29:10.128 --> 29:13.757
-Go away,
I haven't got my face on.
-Oh, stuff and nonsense.

29:13.841 --> 29:16.928
I'm your little brother,
remember?
Are you all right, old girl?

29:17.012 --> 29:20.807
-Yes, thanks, perfectly fine.
-Oh, Molly, Molly.

29:20.891 --> 29:24.770
You looked after
everyone else, didn't you?
And now...

29:26.397 --> 29:30.486
-What about tomorrow?
-I don't know. I don't know.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.779
-I don't know.
-Archie needs you.

29:32.863 --> 29:35.825
Not only for the wedding
but this money business.

29:35.909 --> 29:38.703
I know. I know,
I know. I just can't seem...

29:39.871 --> 29:42.791
to get myself together,
rouse myself.

29:45.002 --> 29:48.381
That's good.
That's... That's very good.

29:49.299 --> 29:50.926
Thank you.

29:51.009 --> 29:53.679
It's not finished yet.

29:53.763 --> 29:56.849
It's got something missing
but I don't quite
know what it is.

29:56.933 --> 30:00.103
Well,
that's what you should do,
finish the portrait.

30:00.187 --> 30:02.689
How's it going to help Archie?

30:02.773 --> 30:04.526
You leave it to me.

30:05.652 --> 30:08.154
I've got a beezer of an idea.

30:18.041 --> 30:22.045
It's always been the same.
No matter how hard I
try to please my wee girl,

30:22.128 --> 30:25.258
all I get is lip.

30:25.341 --> 30:28.637
I just happened to mention I
thought the cake was a wee
bit on the small side,

30:28.720 --> 30:31.682
and she throws me out.

30:31.765 --> 30:34.434
She wouldn't even travel
in the same car
up to the hotel.

30:34.519 --> 30:38.231
Something about
there not being
enough room on my broomstick.

30:42.361 --> 30:44.572
How come you're so
good at this anyway?

30:44.655 --> 30:48.869
I thought this was a game for
wee fat blokes called Jocky or
Oche or something?

30:48.952 --> 30:52.456
-I used to play
against my houseboy in Kenya.
-Oh.

30:52.540 --> 30:58.254
-And did you thrash him
like you're thrashing me?
-Sadly, no.

30:58.337 --> 31:03.260
So, Jolyon, it's time for
a girl to ask a chap
about his intentions.

31:03.343 --> 31:06.181
You haven't said what
we're playing for or, indeed,

31:06.264 --> 31:09.100
why you've been
trying to get me pished
for the last two hours.

31:09.184 --> 31:12.938
Well, Pammie, how shall I...
How shall I put this?

31:13.022 --> 31:16.818
Um, I gather that
you're rather rich.

31:19.529 --> 31:23.910
Oh, Cary, you disappoint me.
That's not how it
goes in the movies.

31:23.993 --> 31:27.497
-I thought you had
a wee bit more class.
-No, it's not for me.

31:27.580 --> 31:32.002
I'm broke to the wide,
homeless as well as hopeless,

31:32.085 --> 31:36.883
but I'm trying to
help your only daughter,
and my only nephew.

31:37.675 --> 31:39.344
I see.

31:39.427 --> 31:42.806
Willie, another vodka in
there for Mother Theresa.

31:51.566 --> 31:55.822
Hello, Lexie. Joining
the local gentry so I hear.

31:55.905 --> 31:59.368
Well, what's a poor girl to do
when you're
the only alternative?

31:59.451 --> 32:03.330
Now away and pour me
a pint of Guinness,
there's a good boy.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.961
-That's my girl.
-Just bluster.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.383
I'm really not
looking forward to this.

32:12.466 --> 32:14.093
Listen, Arch...

32:14.176 --> 32:16.930
Ooh-ooh! I've got
the mixers for the cocktails.

32:17.013 --> 32:18.765
What is your pleasure?

32:18.849 --> 32:21.226
Um, tequila slammer.

32:23.062 --> 32:27.149
Come on, save all
that for tomorrow night.

32:27.233 --> 32:30.988
-Have a good hen night.
See you tomorrow.
-Mmm.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.802
Oh...

32:52.179 --> 32:54.015
I'm so excited and thrilled.

32:54.098 --> 32:56.350
I've been racking my brains
about what to give
you two sweethearts

32:56.434 --> 32:57.935
for a wedding present.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.397
I mean, I'm sure the old place
has got plenty of towels.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.774
Yeah, that is one
thing we do have plenty of.

33:02.858 --> 33:05.195
All your problems
are over, Archie.

33:05.278 --> 33:07.113
Call it Lexie's stake
in the family business.

33:07.197 --> 33:09.657
I'm sorry,
I don't quite understand.

33:09.741 --> 33:14.246
These death duties, you will
let me take care of them
for you, won't you, eh?

33:14.330 --> 33:17.417
-Well, Pamela, that's
extraordinarily generous...
-No problem.

33:17.501 --> 33:19.211
We can easy
afford it, Eric and me.

33:19.294 --> 33:22.297
-I appreciate that,
it's just...
-Listen to me a wee minute.

33:22.381 --> 33:26.844
You know that things haven't
always been so good
between Lexie and me,

33:26.928 --> 33:29.806
just like they were
with you and your daddy.

33:29.890 --> 33:35.230
Well, I'd like to make amends
before it's too late.
You get me?

33:35.313 --> 33:38.525
And besides, it would
give you a proper start,

33:38.608 --> 33:42.279
and I just want my
wee girl to be happy,
that's all I care about.

33:42.363 --> 33:44.240
So, what do you say?

33:46.075 --> 33:48.078
Well, what can I say? Erm...

33:49.246 --> 33:50.789
I accept.

33:58.089 --> 34:00.175
Oh, this is lovely, Lex.

34:00.259 --> 34:03.136
It reminds me so
much of my own wedding.

34:03.220 --> 34:05.849
-Which one?
-The first.

34:05.932 --> 34:08.434
The best. Your daddy.

34:08.518 --> 34:11.647
Oh, I know it all went
a wee bit
pear-shaped later on.

34:11.730 --> 34:17.070
But, see, when he wedded me
and then bedded me,
it was fantastic.

34:18.612 --> 34:22.117
What we had,
your daddy and me,
it gleamed and shone.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.620
Like my new pearls here.

34:24.704 --> 34:27.706
That's funny, I don't
quite remember it like that.

34:27.790 --> 34:33.922
No, well, the shine did go
out of it. And back then
the pearls were from Woolies.

34:34.005 --> 34:38.303
And I'm sorry, pet lamb,
I know it was no
picnic for you growing up.

34:39.762 --> 34:43.559
Look, I'm sorry for you too,
Mum, I really am.

34:43.641 --> 34:48.063
And I'm sorry I've
been a bit snippy
in the past few days.

34:48.148 --> 34:51.359
I've just been worried sick,
mostly about Archie.

34:51.443 --> 34:53.487
Why, darling?

34:53.571 --> 34:59.578
Because I know behind that
brave face, he's in a bad
way about Hector.

35:01.121 --> 35:03.665
And there's these
death duties now.

35:10.758 --> 35:12.343
-What?
-Nothing.

35:13.636 --> 35:15.304
What?

35:15.387 --> 35:17.057
It's a surprise.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.189
Buttonholes.
I've gotta get buttonholes.

35:25.775 --> 35:30.072
-Lexie.
-Your little secret's out.

35:30.155 --> 35:34.034
She just couldn't
help herself, could she?
She just had to show off.

35:34.117 --> 35:36.913
-Look, I can explain...
-You don't need to
explain anything to me

35:36.996 --> 35:39.498
about my mother, Arch.
I know all there is to know.

35:39.582 --> 35:42.585
And I know what this
little stunt is all about.

35:42.670 --> 35:46.172
She's trying to
control my life,
the way it's always been.

35:46.257 --> 35:48.218
I'm sure she's not
trying to do that.

35:48.300 --> 35:52.012
Arch, you are
thinking like a tree stump.

35:52.097 --> 35:54.433
You don't know
her like I know her.

35:54.516 --> 35:58.939
You give her one inch
and she's like
a puma in a parrot house.

35:59.022 --> 36:01.149
I thought it
would be good for you,
for both of you.

36:01.233 --> 36:04.320
Well, you were wrong.

36:04.404 --> 36:10.661
Look, in any case,
this marriage isn't
about me and my mother.

36:10.743 --> 36:15.749
And it's not
about trying to ease
Molly's pain or your guilt,

36:15.833 --> 36:17.919
as much as I'd like that.

36:19.379 --> 36:22.466
But it's about me and you.

36:22.550 --> 36:24.468
And the feelings we
have for each other.

36:24.552 --> 36:27.388
I don't feel
guilt about my father.

36:27.471 --> 36:28.515
No?

36:29.975 --> 36:31.602
Then tell me...

36:33.395 --> 36:36.316
Tell me what is
going on in here

36:36.399 --> 36:42.197
'cause it seems to me
the Archie I know and
I love is in real pain.

36:51.041 --> 36:56.214
Things were...
Things were very bad
between us when he went.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.843
As bad as they'd ever been.

36:59.927 --> 37:03.597
I always felt like I was
a disappointment to him.

37:03.680 --> 37:07.936
Jamie was the golden
boy and I... I wasn't.

37:10.481 --> 37:13.317
Whatever I did I
could never escape that.

37:16.571 --> 37:20.283
We said some
very bitter things
to each other at the end.

37:22.161 --> 37:23.913
Well, I did to him.

37:26.082 --> 37:29.711
And I feel so bad about that

37:29.795 --> 37:33.549
because I'm beginning to think
I might have misjudged him.

37:35.468 --> 37:38.846
There's nothing
I or anyone else
can do about that.

37:40.558 --> 37:43.769
Except Father maybe,
but he's not here, is he?

37:47.190 --> 37:51.236
-I wish I could do
something to help you, Arch.
-You do, you do.

37:52.989 --> 37:55.032
You see, I'm in the middle
of something here

37:55.116 --> 37:57.577
and I am trying to get
through to the other side,

37:57.660 --> 37:59.580
and I will.

37:59.663 --> 38:03.375
I will because I know that
you're gonna be
there waiting for me.

38:03.458 --> 38:05.169
-And once we're
married then...

38:05.253 --> 38:08.798
No. See,
this is what I'm afraid of.

38:08.881 --> 38:14.346
It's not a marriage.
It's a therapy session.

38:14.430 --> 38:17.684
I'm the only one who's
not getting any treatment.

38:19.936 --> 38:24.191
Remember what your father said
when we told him? His curse.

38:26.110 --> 38:30.073
I mean,
he said it would all end
in tears, didn't he?

38:30.157 --> 38:31.909
Well, he was right.

38:41.295 --> 38:42.588
Lexie, wait.

38:50.013 --> 38:53.517
I'm rather cross with you,
rushing off like that.

38:55.102 --> 38:57.813
You left Archie in
rather a bad state.

38:58.815 --> 39:00.359
The boy's lost.

39:01.818 --> 39:04.906
What am I going to
do with him? Or you?

39:14.541 --> 39:15.834
I wonder.

40:12.359 --> 40:13.402
Father?

41:09.217 --> 41:10.261
Goodbye.

41:38.376 --> 41:39.419
Goodbye.

42:18.173 --> 42:22.178
-Mother.
-Ah, morning, Archie.
How are you today?

42:22.261 --> 42:23.554
Fine. Fine.

42:24.805 --> 42:27.433
-It's just that...
-Do you like your rose?

42:28.977 --> 42:30.020
Yes.

42:34.567 --> 42:37.487
-Well, you've got one, too?
-Of course.

42:37.570 --> 42:39.489
You'd better get ready because
there's a job I want you to do

42:39.572 --> 42:42.743
before we leave
for the church.

42:45.079 --> 42:46.831
Is something wrong?

42:56.509 --> 42:59.554
No. No, I don't think so.

43:04.894 --> 43:07.981
-Is it straight?
-As much as he ever was.

43:08.064 --> 43:10.234
Leaning slightly to the right.

43:11.819 --> 43:15.072
Ditto. Ah, that's it.

43:15.155 --> 43:18.034
Ah, you've caught
him just fine, Molly.

43:19.703 --> 43:24.250
His eyes follow you
everywhere, have you noticed?

43:24.333 --> 43:26.669
I'm glad you did him
with a smile on his face.

43:26.752 --> 43:28.839
I wouldn't want
him glaring at me
for the rest of my life.

43:28.922 --> 43:32.384
He'll always be
smiling on you, Archie.

43:32.467 --> 43:35.513
Time we were off.
Are you ready?

43:37.515 --> 43:39.726
Yes, Mother, I think I am.

43:45.316 --> 43:48.278
You look fandabbydozie.

43:48.361 --> 43:50.780
Cheer up,
it might never happen.

43:50.864 --> 43:53.909
-I feel terrible.
-Why, darling?

43:53.993 --> 43:56.412
Because of what
I said to Archie.

43:56.495 --> 44:00.542
You know,
after all he's been through,
and he really needed me there

44:00.626 --> 44:02.002
and I just let him down.

44:02.085 --> 44:06.466
That boy's
tougher than he looks,
you mark my words.

44:06.549 --> 44:09.803
Look, Mum,
can you just leave me alone
for a minute?

44:09.887 --> 44:12.640
-You know, I just want
to get my head together.
-All right.

44:12.723 --> 44:16.353
-I'll come and
shoo you in a bit.
-Okay.

44:16.436 --> 44:19.022
-Shall I bring
you a bacon bap?
-No.

44:35.917 --> 44:37.043
Courage.

44:40.506 --> 44:44.551
Molly. Molly, I think
you'll find I've sorted
everything out for Archie.

44:44.635 --> 44:46.596
Have you, Jo?
How clever of you.

44:46.680 --> 44:50.600
But he'll just
have to struggle along
in my absence.

44:50.684 --> 44:52.311
Why? Where are you going?

44:52.395 --> 44:55.690
Well, old Pammie has asked me
to go and stay
with her and Eric.

44:55.773 --> 44:58.986
They have a luxury
bungalow outside Glasgow.

45:08.705 --> 45:11.250
Where's the bride?
I'm throwing her away.

45:11.333 --> 45:14.253
Duncan, have you seen Lexie?
I cannae find her anywhere.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.506
That's 'cause she's not here.

45:16.589 --> 45:17.966
BOTH: What?

45:18.049 --> 45:20.302
I just saw her get on the bus.

45:33.442 --> 45:38.156
Let's face it, Archie,
she always has had a tendency
to overcook things.

45:44.246 --> 45:46.374
-Archie.
-It's Lexie.

45:46.458 --> 45:48.293
She's done a runner.

45:49.169 --> 45:50.337
Right!

46:06.814 --> 46:10.861
KILWILLIE: Get in here.
That's it.
Put your foot down!

46:14.448 --> 46:16.409
GOLLY: Come on, laddie.

46:26.295 --> 46:30.175
Come on, Archibald,
push the pedal to the metal.

46:30.258 --> 46:33.637
-She's a good start.
-Poor child.
Where's she running to?

46:33.721 --> 46:36.474
-Probably to my
sister's in Dundee.
-She must be desperate.

46:39.143 --> 46:40.938
KILWILLIE: Holy Moses.

46:52.076 --> 46:53.953
DUNCAN:
Please, come on, we're late!

46:55.329 --> 46:56.998
(DUNCAN SHOUTING)

47:18.148 --> 47:19.357
Archie.

47:26.073 --> 47:29.619
KILWILLIE: Blimey O'Reilly.
MOLLY:
Not too fast, not too fast.

47:31.580 --> 47:33.332
GOLLY: Come on, laddie.

47:36.294 --> 47:37.587
KILWILLIE: Steady on.

47:37.670 --> 47:39.088
(KILWILLIE LAUGHING)

47:46.931 --> 47:48.266
There she comes!

47:50.310 --> 47:53.230
DUNCAN: Go on,
Arch, you're gonna do it.

47:54.649 --> 47:56.400
KILWILLIE: Here she is.

48:00.322 --> 48:03.116
-What are you...
-Archie, mind my wee Cadillac.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.119
I know what I'm doing.

48:06.663 --> 48:08.623
DUNCAN: Oh, no, the bus.

48:12.628 --> 48:13.879
What the...?

48:24.141 --> 48:25.476
Hi.

48:25.559 --> 48:27.561
Hello. Hi.

48:34.237 --> 48:36.614
Trying to dodge your fare, eh?

48:41.620 --> 48:44.623
-Archie.
-I'm not gonna take
your mother's money.

48:44.707 --> 48:47.794
I don't know what we'll do,
but we'll do it together.

48:47.877 --> 48:52.425
And as for the wedding,
you were right.
Wrong time, wrong place.

48:52.508 --> 48:56.887
And when we do get married,
there will be no
clouds in the sky,

48:56.971 --> 49:00.726
and the only feelings
will be joy and serenity,

49:00.809 --> 49:03.563
and a certainty that
everything is gonna be okay.

49:07.316 --> 49:09.360
I love you to bits, Lex.

49:10.904 --> 49:12.614
Will you marry me?

49:15.159 --> 49:18.913
-I've got very cold feet.
-I'll warm them up for you.

49:18.997 --> 49:22.793
-You're not ready for this.
-I am.

49:22.877 --> 49:28.717
Archie, if I agreed,
I wouldn't just
be marrying you.

49:28.800 --> 49:31.678
I'd be marrying
a dozen other people.

49:31.762 --> 49:34.057
Whatever makes you say that?

49:40.731 --> 49:43.734
Look, Lex,
you don't have to decide now.

49:43.817 --> 49:46.696
But just come with me.
Come home.

49:59.836 --> 50:01.546
Can you not see?

50:03.966 --> 50:05.843
I got a return ticket.

50:10.474 --> 50:12.184
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

50:13.268 --> 50:14.645
KILWILLIE: Well done.

50:24.573 --> 50:26.742
Oi! Oi!
