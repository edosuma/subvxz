01:24.150 --> 01:26.152
MacGYVER:
It's a known fact

01:26.152 --> 01:28.154
that 80 decibels
of rushing water

01:28.154 --> 01:31.157
is one of the most pleasing
sounds known to mankind.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.660
On the other hand,

01:33.660 --> 01:37.163
10 and a half days at sea
is enough water for anybody.

01:54.681 --> 01:57.684
Thornton is here to make
the pickup...

01:57.684 --> 01:59.686
personally.

02:02.689 --> 02:04.190
(tugboat horn blowing)

02:15.702 --> 02:19.706
And after waltzing my way out
from behind the Iron Curtain,

02:19.706 --> 02:21.207
San Pedro harbor looked

02:21.207 --> 02:24.711
like a little piece
of paradise...

02:24.711 --> 02:26.212
but not for everybody.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.721
You know,

02:34.721 --> 02:36.222
seaweed's generally
not considered

02:36.222 --> 02:38.224
to be the best lure
for fishin'.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.225
Yeah, I know,

02:39.225 --> 02:42.228
but good lures cost
a lot of money.

02:42.228 --> 02:45.732
What you need is somethin'
that reflects.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.235
Like a gum wrapper.

02:50.737 --> 02:51.738
Come on.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.748
You know,
my grandfather used to say,

03:02.248 --> 03:04.751
"You just gotta think
like a fish."

03:05.752 --> 03:07.253
Yeah, but does it work?

03:11.257 --> 03:12.258
Well,

03:12.258 --> 03:16.262
ultimately it's up to the fish,
I think.

03:16.262 --> 03:19.265
Not many girls your age
are into sport fishin'.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.267
Yeah, well,
I don't fish
for sport.

03:21.768 --> 03:22.769
I fish for food.

03:22.769 --> 03:23.770
There.

03:25.772 --> 03:29.275
I mean, you know,
I can't pay you.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.277
Just catch somethin'.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.279
Thank you.

03:42.288 --> 03:43.790
(laughing)

03:43.790 --> 03:45.291
All right!

03:51.798 --> 03:52.799
Hey!

03:52.799 --> 03:54.300
(laughs)

03:54.300 --> 03:55.802
Tell your grandfather it works.

03:55.802 --> 03:56.803
(laughs)

04:05.812 --> 04:08.815
MAN:
Mac!

04:08.815 --> 04:09.816
Hello, Pete!

04:09.816 --> 04:11.317
(laughs)

04:11.317 --> 04:16.322
So, this is MacGyver's
homecoming at last.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.324
I'll get the men
in position.

04:26.332 --> 04:27.834
Mm.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.835
Hi.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.339
Hey!

04:33.339 --> 04:35.341
I pay for efficiency.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.344
Impress me, Mr. Barrett.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.848
Don't worry.
He's good.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.350
I always worry.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.854
And MacGyver
is quite elusive.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.357
Good to see you.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.358
You, too.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.360
And your cargo?

04:54.360 --> 04:55.361
Yeah, got all the names

04:55.361 --> 04:56.362
and the plans
of the terrorists.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.364
There ought to be
a promotion in it
for ya, Pete.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.867
Save it for
the car, okay?

05:02.869 --> 05:03.870
Expecting trouble?

05:03.870 --> 05:05.371
Well, you never can tell.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.374
The East Germans are
just a little bit
hot over this one.

05:08.374 --> 05:09.876
Nice to know
my work is appreciated.

05:09.876 --> 05:10.877
(chuckles)

05:19.886 --> 05:21.387
Uh-huh.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.889
They yours?

05:22.889 --> 05:23.890
Nope.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.894
Which one you want?

05:27.894 --> 05:28.895
Both.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.897
You get that
list out of here.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.398
You sure?

05:32.398 --> 05:33.900
Now! Move!

05:37.904 --> 05:39.906
(grunts)

05:57.423 --> 05:58.925
(groans)

06:21.447 --> 06:23.950
? ?

06:37.463 --> 06:39.465
I don't believe it!

06:41.968 --> 06:43.469
You are an officer
of the law.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.471
I can tell.

06:45.972 --> 06:46.973
What can I do
for ya?

06:46.973 --> 06:49.475
Well, I'm being
pursued by ter...

06:58.484 --> 06:59.485
Well done.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.486
Get him out of here.

07:06.993 --> 07:07.994
PETE:
That's him.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.996
No question about it.

07:09.996 --> 07:14.500
Kurt Neilson, East
German Intelligence,

07:14.500 --> 07:17.003
rank of colonel.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.505
Huh. Boy's been around.
All right.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.507
Make copies, circulate.
Get word out

07:21.507 --> 07:23.009
on the streets right away!

07:23.009 --> 07:25.011
Yes, sir.
I'll get on it
right away.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.513
NEILSON:
Search him... thoroughly.

07:38.024 --> 07:41.027
The list's not on him.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.029
Care to tell me
where it is hidden, MacGyver?

07:43.029 --> 07:45.531
You know, I just don't seem
to remember.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.533
You see, Barrett,

07:47.533 --> 07:51.037
Mr. MacGyver
is a genuine patriot.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.538
They can be
remarkably stubborn.

07:59.045 --> 08:02.048
But even
a stubborn patriot

08:02.048 --> 08:04.550
like you can
be, uh,

08:04.550 --> 08:08.054
persuaded to speak.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.063
There are many methods
I could use

08:17.063 --> 08:19.065
to get the information...

08:21.067 --> 08:25.571
but this is my favorite.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.575
Hey, look, guys...

08:29.575 --> 08:30.576
(clears throat)

08:30.576 --> 08:33.078
I got this thing about needles.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.581
Here's an idea.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.583
Why don't you just try drippin'
water on my forehead?

08:40.586 --> 08:42.587
The old rubber hose
and bright light trick.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.593
The list.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.095
Hypnotism?
It's been known to work.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.597
The KGB uses it all the time.
They got it down to a science.

08:51.597 --> 08:52.598
Whatta you say?

09:09.615 --> 09:12.118
You have good veins.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.119
Thank you.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.628
Come on.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.135
(grunts)

09:33.139 --> 09:38.144
That burning sensation
will disappear shortly.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.653
The serum was specifically
designed for you, MacGyver.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.658
You are probably
wondering

09:52.658 --> 09:54.660
about the effects
of the injection.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.163
The initial effect
is disorientation,

09:57.163 --> 09:59.665
double vision, hallucinations.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.668
I was kinda hopin'
that's whatthiswas.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.671
When your mind clears,
in roughly three hours,

10:05.671 --> 10:08.174
the pain will become
excruciating.

10:08.174 --> 10:11.677
And if that does not
convince you to cooperate,

10:11.677 --> 10:14.680
this injection
has a side effect;

10:14.680 --> 10:16.682
it will kill you.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.187
Of course,
it can all be stopped

10:21.187 --> 10:24.690
with this antidote.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.692
However,

10:26.692 --> 10:30.196
if you don't take
the antidote within six hours,

10:30.196 --> 10:33.699
give or take a few moments,

10:33.699 --> 10:37.703
the serum is irreversible.

10:38.704 --> 10:41.707
Six hours,
and you begin to die.

10:51.717 --> 10:52.718
Begin counting.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.226
(beeping)

11:00.226 --> 11:01.227
(beeps)

11:14.240 --> 11:16.242
It's your choice, MacGyver...

11:16.242 --> 11:19.745
to live...

11:19.745 --> 11:21.247
or to die.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.262
MacGYVER:
Being told
when you're gonna die

11:36.262 --> 11:38.264
kinda puts a little
pressure on you.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.771
Don't try
anything funny.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.286
Enjoy.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.793
(door locking)

12:24.810 --> 12:27.813
All right,
think, MacGyver, think.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.316
Think, think...

12:30.316 --> 12:33.319
Not too much
to work with in here.

12:33.319 --> 12:36.822
And my arm's throbbing pretty
good from that shot.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.837
Come on, Mac, time's a-wasting.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.842
NEILSON:
I am sure this is a secure line.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.844
Yes, Herr Kommandant,

12:58.844 --> 13:01.847
we have possession
of the international courier.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.349
No.

13:03.349 --> 13:06.852
We'll have it very shortly.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.355
One time when I was a kid,

13:09.855 --> 13:11.357
I built a slingshot

13:11.357 --> 13:13.359
out of a couple
of broken hockey sticks

13:13.359 --> 13:15.861
and an old inner tube.

13:15.861 --> 13:18.864
And, you know, no matter
how hard I practiced,

13:18.864 --> 13:20.366
I just could never miss...

13:20.366 --> 13:22.868
my neighbor's window.

13:40.386 --> 13:44.890
Problem withthisslingshot
is, I only get one shot.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.918
? ?

14:29.935 --> 14:31.937
Can't you do anything
without eating?

14:31.937 --> 14:33.439
I'm listening.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.441
I'll hear him
when he starts

14:35.441 --> 14:37.443
seeing things and
yelling about them.

14:48.454 --> 14:49.955
I had running water

14:49.955 --> 14:53.459
and an electrical socket
nearby.

14:53.459 --> 14:56.462
It could be a heck
of a combination

14:56.462 --> 14:58.464
if I put them together right.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.489
? ?

15:53.519 --> 15:55.521
? ?

16:24.049 --> 16:25.551
(water dripping)

16:25.551 --> 16:26.552
What's that?

16:26.552 --> 16:27.553
I don't know.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.054
Sounds like water.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.067
(yelling)

16:42.067 --> 16:44.069
MacGyver! Neilson
said he might try

16:44.570 --> 16:45.571
something like this.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.582
Come on.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.592
(yelling)

17:15.601 --> 17:18.103
(grunting)

17:33.619 --> 17:35.120
He broke my nose!

17:35.120 --> 17:36.622
He broke my damn nose!

17:44.630 --> 17:45.631
MacGyver!

17:45.631 --> 17:47.132
Alive!

17:47.132 --> 17:49.134
Take him alive!

17:51.637 --> 17:53.138
Find him!

17:53.138 --> 17:54.640
He couldn't have gotten far!

17:59.144 --> 18:00.145
(honking)

18:00.145 --> 18:01.647
(tires screeching)

18:01.647 --> 18:04.650
DRIVER:
Watch where you're
going, you dumb drunk!

18:11.156 --> 18:12.658
I think we
lost him.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.159
He can't go far.
Keep searching.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.661
He doesn't have
to go any farther

18:15.661 --> 18:18.163
than the first phone
to call the police.
He won't!

18:18.163 --> 18:20.165
By now, his mind
is scrambled,

18:20.165 --> 18:22.668
confused for at least
three more hours.

18:22.668 --> 18:25.170
So you'd better find MacGyver.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.172
Now!

18:33.178 --> 18:37.683
(labored breathing)

18:47.192 --> 18:49.695
(moaning)

18:56.702 --> 18:57.703
So you're gonna tell me

18:57.703 --> 18:59.204
you caught that fish
all by yourself?

18:59.204 --> 19:00.205
I caught this
fish, man.

19:00.205 --> 19:01.707
I think you bought
it at the market.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.709
I didnotbuy
this fish.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.711
YOUNG MAN:
Come on, Lisa,Ican't
even catch a fish.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.212
Big fish, all right?

19:07.212 --> 19:08.714
This is gonna
be dinner for me.

19:08.714 --> 19:09.715
This is a
beautiful fish.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.217
You should see it.
I mean, it's gorgeous.

19:12.217 --> 19:15.220
I caught it
by myself, okay?

19:15.220 --> 19:17.723
(panting)

19:17.723 --> 19:19.725
YOUNG MAN:
Hey, look at
that dude, man.

19:19.725 --> 19:22.728
He's drunk!
Check him out.

19:22.728 --> 19:23.729
Yeah, that's him!
Huh?

19:23.729 --> 19:25.230
Who?
That's him.
I know him.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.732
You're kidding.
What do you mean?

19:26.732 --> 19:28.233
I've never seen
that guy before.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.735
LISA:
From the pier.
No, with the fish.

19:29.735 --> 19:33.238
(panting)

19:33.238 --> 19:36.241
A dude looking like him
is nobody to know.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.243
LISA:
No, no, he's okay.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.745
YOUNG WOMAN:
He's a drunk.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.748
He did me a favor.
No strings.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.249
YOUNG MAN:
Lisa, that dude
is messed up.

19:44.249 --> 19:45.751
Look at him.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.753
(moaning gently)

19:47.753 --> 19:48.754
I owe him.

19:48.754 --> 19:49.755
Hey, wait a minute.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.256
Come on, you got
enough trouble, Lisa.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.257
Don't even get involved.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.259
You're a runaway, remember?

19:54.259 --> 19:56.762
Come on, let's go.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.263
(groaning)

19:58.263 --> 19:59.264
LISA:
I gotta.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.265
Lisa, don't do it.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.767
I-I just gotta.

20:01.767 --> 20:02.768
(sighs)

20:02.768 --> 20:03.769
YOUNG MAN:
Lisa, come on.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.271
Hey, hey, you okay?

20:08.774 --> 20:10.275
Let's go.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.277
Get rid of him, man.
Not ours.

20:12.277 --> 20:15.781
(panting)

20:15.781 --> 20:17.783
It's me.

20:17.783 --> 20:20.786
Remember,
from the docks this morning?

20:20.786 --> 20:21.787
Remember?

20:23.288 --> 20:25.290
Remember?

20:25.290 --> 20:27.292
Fish. Brain food.

20:28.794 --> 20:33.298
(groaning)

20:34.800 --> 20:36.301
You're one sick guy.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.805
(indistinct
radio transmission)

20:39.805 --> 20:42.808
There's a policeman, but, uh,

20:42.808 --> 20:44.810
the last thing I need is a cop.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.815
But I guess
in your case...

21:04.830 --> 21:06.331
No!

21:06.832 --> 21:10.335
No police.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.837
Please.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.344
I'm gonna
regret this.

21:19.344 --> 21:22.347
I know I'm going
to regret this.

21:22.347 --> 21:23.849
Okay, up.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.851
Stay.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.473
Careful.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.976
Soon he will have incidence
of very acute pain,

21:50.976 --> 21:53.478
but there will be fewer
hallucinatory episodes.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.981
And a better chance
of him remembering
to call his people.

21:55.981 --> 21:56.982
Not yet.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.984
This way.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.988
NEILSON:
His memory will remain groggy
for a while longer.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.493
But as MacGyver approaches
death, his mind will clear.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.996
He will gradually
begin to remember.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.500
He will realize
that I hold his life.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.003
I hold him as on a leash.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.006
MacGyver cannot escape.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.509
Each second that ticks away
cuts him like a knife.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.511
Careful.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.013
He must come back to me

22:28.013 --> 22:30.015
This is it.
if he is to live.

22:30.015 --> 22:34.019
I want you to put one leg
through this window here.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.025
Come on.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.528
Okay. Okay.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.534
There you go.
There you go.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.047
(metallic tinkling)

23:02.047 --> 23:05.550
My burglar alarm.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.551
Come on.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.056
Here we go.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.062
Okay, you all right?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.563
You're getting
better, okay.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.065
Now there's
stairs here.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.067
One step at a time.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.568
(whispers):
Here we go.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.569
He's out there.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.571
Someone has seen him.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.073
Find that someone.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.079
(engine turning)

23:46.091 --> 23:48.593
Okay, in here.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.096
Stay right there.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.599
Okay, come here.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.601
Right here.

23:56.601 --> 24:00.105
It's not much,
but it's mine.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.109
You made it real nice.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.613
I did the best
with what I got.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.627
You gonna be okay?

24:22.627 --> 24:24.129
Yeah.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.133
Even got electricity. See?

24:29.134 --> 24:33.138
Got it out of an old car
in a wrecking yard.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.647
My name's Lisa.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.150
Lisa.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.153
And you know me?

24:48.153 --> 24:50.155
What, have you got a screw loose
or something?

24:50.155 --> 24:51.156
We met this morning.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.658
You made me that great lure,
remember?

24:53.658 --> 24:56.161
I caught a fish with
your gum wrapper.

24:56.161 --> 24:59.664
I don't seem to remember
much of anything at the moment.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.666
Mm. Well,
maybe some food

25:01.666 --> 25:02.667
will help.

25:02.667 --> 25:03.668
You hungry?

25:03.668 --> 25:06.671
Yeah. I could eat a...

25:06.671 --> 25:07.672
Fish.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.679
Uh...

25:14.679 --> 25:16.681
let's see if you can, uh,

25:16.681 --> 25:20.185
take the bones out of this
while I start the stove.

25:32.197 --> 25:35.200
Hey, you're like me--
you make do with what you got.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.205
Yeah, I guess I do.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.711
You in some kind
of trouble, Lisa?

25:46.711 --> 25:49.214
You mean,
what's a nice kid like me

25:49.214 --> 25:52.217
doing in a rat hole like this?

25:52.217 --> 25:55.220
It is a long, dull story.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.722
I'd like to hear it.

25:58.723 --> 25:59.724
Well...

25:59.724 --> 26:02.727
I figure my dad, uh,

26:02.727 --> 26:04.229
you know,
when he was a kid,

26:04.229 --> 26:07.732
he never had a punching bag,
so he married one.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.235
And you got caught
in the middle?

26:12.737 --> 26:15.240
Of the target.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.242
(sighs)

26:17.242 --> 26:19.244
So when they both started on me,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.246
I split.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.748
The first two times
I went to the cops.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.750
They, uh, dumped
me in some

26:25.750 --> 26:26.751
juvenile lockup.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.253
It smelled like
what those fish

26:28.253 --> 26:30.255
are gonna smell
like in a week.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.256
Nobody listened?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.258
Oh, uh...

26:33.258 --> 26:35.760
this social worker
checked out my story.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.264
So the judge tells my parents
to get their act together

26:39.264 --> 26:41.766
and take me home,
because the hall

26:41.766 --> 26:45.270
is not a good place
for a vulnerable adolescent.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.273
Home is better.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.776
Home sweet home.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.278
I think I get the picture.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.779
So they got me home,
and my dad

26:55.280 --> 26:56.781
got his act together, all right.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.783
On my face.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.286
(frying pan sizzling)
Oh.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.792
So you split? For good?

27:07.792 --> 27:08.793
For me.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.295
And I'm hanging in there.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.297
Look it, I got schoolbooks.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.798
I'm gonna get a diploma.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.800
I'm gonna make something
of myself.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.803
I don't know exactly what.
(laughs)

27:18.803 --> 27:20.805
How about a success?

27:20.805 --> 27:22.807
Oh, yeah, right.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.809
Yeah. Right.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.314
(grunts in pain)

27:31.316 --> 27:33.318
(groans)

27:40.325 --> 27:41.826
No, we're not gonna
hassle Lisa.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.828
We just want that guy
she was with.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.830
I think we got something.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.333
Yeah. A straight line
to MacGyver.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.834
Barrett...

27:50.335 --> 27:52.337
no excuses this time.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.863
(gasps)

28:49.394 --> 28:50.895
(panting)

28:56.401 --> 28:58.903
(yells)

28:58.903 --> 29:01.906
(MacGyver panting)

29:05.910 --> 29:08.913
Hey.
(gasps)

29:08.913 --> 29:12.417
It's me.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.419
What's the matter?

29:16.921 --> 29:19.924
It was a nightmare,
I guess.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.938
(distorted):
Are you all right?

29:35.440 --> 29:37.442
Watch where you're going,
you dumb drunk!

29:47.952 --> 29:50.955
What is it?

29:50.955 --> 29:51.456
What can I do for you?

29:53.958 --> 29:54.959
(loud grunt)

29:56.961 --> 30:00.465
My name's MacGyver.

30:00.965 --> 30:04.469
I got back in the country
this morning.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.971
I, uh...

30:07.972 --> 30:10.475
I stashed the list.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.976
The list? What-what list?

30:13.478 --> 30:14.979
They grabbed me.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.484
They...

30:28.993 --> 30:30.495
I don't have much time.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.497
You have less time
than you think.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.498
I came to tell you that

30:33.498 --> 30:36.000
there are three guys outside
snooping around.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.005
What's that?

30:41.005 --> 30:42.507
My burglar alarm.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.509
What do they want?

30:44.509 --> 30:45.510
Me.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.019
Check for another entrance.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.027
Listen...

31:03.027 --> 31:06.030
do you have
a small transistor radio?

31:06.030 --> 31:08.533
Yeah, I think so.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.535
Good.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.037
We're gonna buy some time.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.545
What're you doing
with that TV tube?

31:20.545 --> 31:22.547
Cooking up a surprise.

31:22.547 --> 31:25.049
Hand me those jumper cables,
will you?

31:31.055 --> 31:32.557
Remember,
we want him alive.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.059
What's going on?

31:35.059 --> 31:37.061
I'm trying to get us
a running start,

31:37.061 --> 31:40.064
away from those guys.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.066
How are you gonna
do that?

31:42.066 --> 31:44.068
Well, when these
jumper cables touch,

31:44.068 --> 31:46.571
an electrical surge
is gonna hit that tube

31:46.571 --> 31:48.573
and cause an overload.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.591
Perfect.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.608
All right,
let's see that radio.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.613
This ought to get 'em
up here in a hurry.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.115
(loud rock music playing)

32:31.115 --> 32:32.617
Let's go.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.622
(rock music playing
in distance)

32:39.624 --> 32:41.626
(music continues)

32:45.129 --> 32:47.632
(music playing louder)

32:47.632 --> 32:49.133
Hear it?

32:49.133 --> 32:50.134
Upstairs.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.139
(music continues)

33:07.652 --> 33:09.153
(screams)

33:09.153 --> 33:12.156
(whispers):
Come on, Lisa. Come on.

33:12.156 --> 33:15.660
What happened?
I don't know, some
kind of a blast.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.173
Oh, no.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.175
(chuckles):
No, not me.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.177
It's the only way out.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.682
I hope you know
what you're doing.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.183
Me, too.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.702
They're gone.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.203
Hold it.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.207
(door creaks)

34:03.207 --> 34:04.208
Nothing.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.714
What're we gonna
tell Neilson?

34:18.723 --> 34:20.224
Like the magician said,

34:20.725 --> 34:23.226
a little misdirection
never hurt.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.234
Hold it.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.742
LISA:
You're sick.
I'm not gonna leave you alone.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.244
Lisa, the best way
you could help me right now

34:40.244 --> 34:44.248
is to call Peter Thornton
at the Federal Building.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.752
Ask for the DXS.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.754
Tell him MacGyver's
at the old warehouse on,

34:49.754 --> 34:52.757
on, um, Tucker Street.

34:52.757 --> 34:53.757
You got that?
Yeah.

34:53.757 --> 34:57.261
Tell him if I'm not around
when he gets there,

34:57.261 --> 34:58.763
that the list
is hidden

34:58.763 --> 35:00.264
in the base
of the light standard

35:00.765 --> 35:01.766
where we met
this morning.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.767
Wait.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.269
The light pole?
The list?

35:05.269 --> 35:06.771
What does this mean?

35:10.775 --> 35:15.780
I-I did a job...
for the government.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.783
Oh, man, does
this sound wild!

35:18.783 --> 35:23.287
It's important...
real important, Lisa.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.789
Will you do it for me?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.293
Yeah, I'll do it.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.797
Where are you gonna be?

35:32.797 --> 35:34.298
I'll be
at the warehouse.

35:34.298 --> 35:36.300
Hopefully I've got enough time

35:36.300 --> 35:38.302
to find a cure
for all my troubles.

35:39.804 --> 35:43.307
Get outta here,
will ya?

35:47.311 --> 35:48.813
(moans gently)

36:13.337 --> 36:15.840
? ?

36:47.371 --> 36:49.373
? ?

37:07.892 --> 37:09.894
(air rushing out)

37:27.912 --> 37:28.913
(grunts)

37:54.438 --> 37:56.440
? ?

38:18.963 --> 38:21.465
Time is about up.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.968
So it appears you lose.

38:23.968 --> 38:24.969
The list
is still hidden.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.971
Only MacGyver knows where,
and he is dying.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.473
My superiors will have
to accept the best result

38:29.473 --> 38:30.474
we could obtain.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.476
Here is your payment,
Barrett.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.978
Count it.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.982
MacGYVER:
All right, MacGyver, think.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.984
Rope...

38:41.986 --> 38:42.987
a smoke alarm...

38:44.488 --> 38:46.490
sheets of plywood.

38:46.490 --> 38:51.495
Yeah, it just might work.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.012
No, this is not a joke.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.514
This is an emergency!

39:12.016 --> 39:15.519
Look, just tell Peter Thornton
that MacGyver needs help.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.522
Look, I can't come in.

39:18.522 --> 39:21.025
I just told you where he was.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.527
Just get the message through,
all right?

39:43.047 --> 39:46.050
MacGYVER:
The idea of a smoke alarm
is to get people's attention.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.052
Better hope it'll work
on these guys, too.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.088
? ?

40:52.116 --> 40:53.117
What do you mean,

40:53.117 --> 40:54.618
the operator
just got around

40:54.618 --> 40:56.620
to forwarding
the message?

40:56.620 --> 40:58.122
There was
no emergency code on it.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.623
(sighs)

40:59.623 --> 41:02.126
Well, there is
now-- Code 101!

41:02.126 --> 41:04.628
I want every
damned man we've got

41:04.628 --> 41:06.630
moving on that warehouse,
right now.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.643
It's really only MacGyver
who loses.

41:19.643 --> 41:20.644
Pity.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.646
A remarkable man.

41:22.646 --> 41:26.150
(smoke alarm blares)

41:26.650 --> 41:27.651
What is that?

41:27.651 --> 41:30.154
Sounds like
a smoke alarm.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.155
Check it.

41:38.662 --> 41:41.165
(alarm blaring)

41:44.168 --> 41:45.669
Hi, guys.

41:45.669 --> 41:48.172
Listen, uh,

41:48.172 --> 41:50.174
I'm not feelin' too good.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.177
You win.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.681
I need the antidote.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.683
Come down from there.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.185
You bet.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.687
Yeah...

42:06.190 --> 42:07.691
(shouting)

42:17.201 --> 42:18.202
(grunts)

42:33.717 --> 42:36.220
(grunting)

42:49.233 --> 42:51.235
MacGyver!

42:53.737 --> 42:56.240
(approaching sirens)

42:56.240 --> 42:57.741
Those sirens are for you.

42:57.741 --> 43:01.245
They sound like a dirge.

43:02.746 --> 43:03.747
With the antidote gone,

43:03.747 --> 43:07.751
we can say...
good-bye, MacGyver.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.264
(panting)

43:20.264 --> 43:22.266
(grunting)

43:24.768 --> 43:27.271
I win.

43:34.278 --> 43:37.281
You don't even have
the strength left.

43:38.782 --> 43:39.783
(grunts)

43:40.784 --> 43:42.286
Oh!

43:48.792 --> 43:50.294
What was he
talking about?

43:50.294 --> 43:51.795
An antidote?

43:53.797 --> 43:55.799
It's something I need

43:55.799 --> 43:59.303
if I want to live
through the day.

43:59.303 --> 44:00.304
You've been poisoned?

44:00.304 --> 44:01.805
Is that what this
is all about?

44:21.825 --> 44:24.828
What are you doing?

44:24.828 --> 44:28.332
The impact causes temporary
molecular structural alignment

44:28.832 --> 44:30.334
in iron.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.336
All of the ions
run to the other end.

44:32.336 --> 44:34.338
What?

44:36.340 --> 44:38.342
I just made myself a magnet.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.369
Come on.

45:07.871 --> 45:09.873
Stay... stay.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.886
Come on.

45:29.393 --> 45:32.396
(panting)

46:02.926 --> 46:05.929
? ?

46:35.459 --> 46:37.461
Lisa!

46:40.964 --> 46:41.965
That's it?

46:41.965 --> 46:43.967
That's it.

46:45.969 --> 46:48.472
I'm not even gonna ask
what's in it.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.973
Well, I'll tell ya.

46:49.973 --> 46:51.975
It's a bargaining chip...

46:51.975 --> 46:54.478
worth a lot to a lot
of people...

46:54.478 --> 46:56.480
including you.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.483
I'm gonna talk
to Pete Thornton
about arranging

46:59.483 --> 47:01.485
a government scholarship.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.487
(laughs)

47:08.992 --> 47:09.993
That's great!

47:10.494 --> 47:11.995
It's great!

47:11.995 --> 47:13.497
(laughs)
