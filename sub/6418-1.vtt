<i>Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!</i>

03:08.855 --> 03:10.049
For you.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.384
One for you.

03:15.461 --> 03:16.485
For you.

03:16.596 --> 03:17.688
One for you.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.458
One for you.

03:27.073 --> 03:30.270
How come we can't ever have
just, like, a salad?

03:30.743 --> 03:32.768
Be grateful, Juan Pablo.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.309
Today is especially delicious.

04:47.854 --> 04:51.346
Orphans, smile and be happy,

04:52.558 --> 04:55.288
for God has blessed us
with a new teacher.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.855
She hails from
the Oaxaca Parish Convent

04:59.098 --> 05:03.626
of the lmmaculate Heart
Sisters Lady Mountains

05:04.637 --> 05:05.865
of Guadalupe.

05:06.906 --> 05:10.239
Sister Encarnaci처n.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.161
Thank you, Brother.

05:41.307 --> 05:46.176
Children, today I want to tell you
a story about Isabel.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.924
Okay, new game.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.961
- Go get it!
- Hey, that's my ball!

06:11.537 --> 06:12.595
Sister.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.573
I'm Ignacio.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.372
God be with you, Ignacio.

06:21.914 --> 06:23.040
Anyways,

06:24.717 --> 06:26.651
I was wondering
if you would like to join me

06:26.753 --> 06:29.688
in my quarters this night for some toast.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.219
Look alive!

06:37.196 --> 06:40.927
There is a man sick with influenza.
I need for you to pay him a visit, huh?

06:41.033 --> 06:43.058
- But the sister and I...
- You are always complaining

06:43.169 --> 06:45.364
of never having priestly duties.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.371
Here is your big duty, huh?

06:48.474 --> 06:49.634
Go now,

06:50.410 --> 06:53.208
so that Sister and I may talk
of holy things.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.880
I like your cow.

07:58.544 --> 07:59.909
Where is he?

08:15.061 --> 08:18.963
Holy Father, please receive this man
to your kingdom.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.530
Thank you for coming here today.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.969
This man lived a good life.

09:00.673 --> 09:03.506
He had a wonderful woman,

09:06.512 --> 09:08.036
a lush garden,

09:14.487 --> 09:17.422
and a collection
of Russian nesting dolls.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.354
May he rest in peace.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.316
Okay.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.423
Hey!

<i>Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!</i>

11:45.571 --> 11:46.663
Okay.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.383
How's it going?

12:00.820 --> 12:02.981
It's very late, Ignacio.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.428
Give me a second.

12:26.812 --> 12:27.904
Good toast.

12:34.620 --> 12:35.609
So,

12:38.858 --> 12:40.723
<i>everyone calls you g체ero.</i>

12:42.762 --> 12:45.856
My mother was a Lutheran missionary
from Scandinavia

12:46.699 --> 12:49.099
and my father, a deacon from Mexico.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.503
They tried to convert each other,

13:01.080 --> 13:02.945
but they got married instead.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.952
And then they died.

13:25.004 --> 13:28.963
So anyways, let's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.336
Tell me,

13:32.044 --> 13:34.012
who is this Encarnaci처n?

13:37.449 --> 13:38.507
Well,

13:39.585 --> 13:42.679
my favorite color is light tan.

13:43.856 --> 13:47.451
My favorite animal is puppies.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.557
I like serving the Lord.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.063
Hiking.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.126
Play volleyball.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.895
You gotta be kidding me.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.663
Everything you just said
is my favorite thing to do

14:01.207 --> 14:02.640
every day.

14:04.243 --> 14:07.872
So, you enjoy yourself here
at the Brotherhood?

14:10.382 --> 14:13.510
The children, I love the children.
They are my heart.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.187
But to tell you the truth,

14:17.323 --> 14:20.383
the brothers make me cook stew
and stuff all day,

14:20.492 --> 14:23.427
but they don't give me money
for fresh ingredients.

14:25.598 --> 14:30.262
And they don't think I know a buttload
of crap about the Gospel, but I do.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.928
Okay?

14:35.808 --> 14:38.470
Today, I saw a man in town.

14:39.879 --> 14:44.680
People were throwing daisies at him
and giving him goodies.

14:46.318 --> 14:48.980
Sometimes I would like
that kind of respect.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.555
Who was this man?

14:52.358 --> 14:55.191
<i>Well, to tell you the truth,
he was a luchador.</i>

14:57.830 --> 14:59.991
Wrestling is ungodly, Ignacio.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.768
People cheer for him,
but he is a false idol.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.134
Whatever.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.177
Be patient, Brother.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.410
This, too, shall pass.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.209
What is this?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.679
Leftovers.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.044
Enjoy.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.151
There is no flavor.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.516
There are no spices.
Where are the chips?

15:56.221 --> 15:58.018
Somebody stole them.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.149
Did you not tell them
that they were the Lord's chips?

16:01.260 --> 16:02.955
I was trying to...

16:03.996 --> 16:07.295
- You are useless, Ignacio.
- Silence, Brothers.

16:10.769 --> 16:14.728
This is the worst lunch I ever had.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.601
Your only job is to cook.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.907
Do you not realize
I have had diarrhea since Easters?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.042
Okay.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.310
Maybe I am not meant for these duties.

16:29.688 --> 16:33.886
Cooking duty. Dead guy duty.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.485
Maybe it's time for me
to get a better duty.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.245
I think your food is good.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.519
I am the gatekeeper of my own destiny,

17:03.756 --> 17:06.384
and I will have my glory day
in the hot sun.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.916
Okay?

17:11.262 --> 17:12.423
See you.

18:36.715 --> 18:38.580
Hey! Listen to me! Hey!

18:38.684 --> 18:40.982
<i>Mucho take it easy. I need your help.</i>

18:46.258 --> 18:47.816
Take out the legs!

18:48.760 --> 18:50.091
Listen to me!

18:50.195 --> 18:53.631
Today, I have the chance of a lifetime,
but first I need a man.

18:53.732 --> 18:54.960
Get off me!

18:59.505 --> 19:00.995
Don't you see?

19:01.106 --> 19:04.803
Your skills plus my skills
in the ring, tag team.

19:05.611 --> 19:06.908
You're crazy!

19:08.046 --> 19:10.742
Aren't you tired
of getting dirt kicked in your face?

19:10.849 --> 19:11.941
I am!

19:13.986 --> 19:16.147
Don't you want a little taste of the glory?

19:16.255 --> 19:18.189
See what it tastes like?

19:18.357 --> 19:19.346
No!

19:22.861 --> 19:24.795
If we win, we get 200 pesos!

20:05.504 --> 20:06.732
Chancho!

20:08.207 --> 20:09.367
Chancho!

20:13.845 --> 20:16.439
Chancho, I need to borrow
some sweats.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.038
Are you leaving us?

20:18.717 --> 20:20.912
No, Chancho, I would never leave you.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.953
I just need to borrow some sweats.

22:21.373 --> 22:23.739
NEW WRESTLERS TOURNAMENT

23:11.490 --> 23:13.321
His hair. We bet his hair.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.217
What?

23:15.327 --> 23:17.227
You can take the Stallion.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.492
I'll take the Pony.

23:19.598 --> 23:20.792
I can't wrestle him.

23:20.899 --> 23:24.858
But you are tall and fast like a gazelle.
You can do it.

23:25.537 --> 23:27.664
Pray to the Lord for strength.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.401
I don't believe in God,
I believe in science.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.341
You have not been baptized?

23:37.449 --> 23:39.542
Hey. How you doing?

23:41.753 --> 23:43.084
He's good.

23:45.991 --> 23:47.151
Hello!

23:47.526 --> 23:50.359
I'm talking to you. I will come.

23:50.962 --> 23:53.021
Save me a piece of that corn.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.234
Save me a piece of that corn for later.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.268
Hey. Take it easy.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.249
Come on, Esqueleto!

24:25.564 --> 24:26.656
Okay.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.263
No problem. We are dancing.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.244
That didn't hurt!

24:48.520 --> 24:50.112
And then I disappear!

24:51.189 --> 24:54.590
Taste it. Yes! I'm going to pull you.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.023
The shoe!

25:11.610 --> 25:14.272
Anaconda squeeze.

25:15.146 --> 25:16.306
Okay.

25:17.516 --> 25:22.317
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

25:25.924 --> 25:29.917
Semental! Semental!
Semental! Semental!

25:34.232 --> 25:36.598
Those guys were
a couple of wussies, huh?

25:37.836 --> 25:39.736
They scalped my hairs, okay?

25:41.439 --> 25:43.907
- I look hideous.
- Come on, baby.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.273
And you gave them permissi처n
to hurt me like this.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.712
But I couldn't have anybody see
my face, Steven, come on.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.612
Tonight,

25:54.319 --> 25:56.253
I felt something deep inside me,

25:56.788 --> 25:58.415
I've never felt before.

26:04.696 --> 26:06.630
Do you remember that one time

26:07.332 --> 26:09.630
when everyone was shouting my name

26:10.902 --> 26:13.564
and I used my strength
to rip my blouse?

26:14.239 --> 26:15.228
Yeah.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.138
And I saw them
knock you unconscious, all right?

26:27.519 --> 26:28.679
What's this?

26:29.087 --> 26:31.021
It's money. What did you think?

26:32.657 --> 26:34.022
But we lost.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.125
We all get a piece.

26:36.628 --> 26:37.788
Listen,

26:38.096 --> 26:40.360
the people, they like you guys.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.928
Come back next week,
and I will get another fight for you.

28:45.924 --> 28:47.050
Chancho.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.188
When you are a man

28:52.130 --> 28:54.826
sometimes you wear stretchy pants

28:55.734 --> 28:56.894
in your room.

28:57.435 --> 28:58.663
It's for fun.

28:59.637 --> 29:02.231
Don't worry. I won't tell nobody.

29:16.788 --> 29:18.847
I'm a little concerned right now.

29:19.624 --> 29:22.491
About your salvation and stuff.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.889
How come you have not been baptized?

29:26.998 --> 29:29.660
Because I never got around to it, okay?

29:38.009 --> 29:40.773
I don't know why you always
have to be judging me

29:41.312 --> 29:43.712
because I only believe in science.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.780
But tonight,

29:46.651 --> 29:49.381
we are going up
against Satan's Cavemen.

29:50.355 --> 29:53.119
And I just thought
it would be a good idea if you...

29:53.224 --> 29:55.283
Praise the Lord!

30:04.269 --> 30:06.829
Hey, we're not allowed to watch that.

32:03.154 --> 32:04.917
Hey! Hey!

32:05.490 --> 32:06.718
Tag me!

33:07.852 --> 33:09.319
What? What are you doing?

33:09.420 --> 33:11.285
No, no, no, no! No, no!

33:17.195 --> 33:18.526
Ignacio.

33:18.629 --> 33:20.563
<i>No! No, no, no! No, no, no!</i>

33:20.665 --> 33:21.859
What the...

33:22.133 --> 33:23.100
Move!

34:57.195 --> 34:59.095
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

34:59.197 --> 35:02.189
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

35:02.300 --> 35:04.063
Chancho! Put him down!

35:04.168 --> 35:06.329
- Fight! Fight!
- Put him down, Chancho! Stop it!

35:06.437 --> 35:09.406
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Please, stop it!

35:09.807 --> 35:12.207
Break it up! Break it up! Break it up!

35:12.944 --> 35:14.639
What's wrong with you?

35:16.647 --> 35:17.807
But, Sister,

35:18.249 --> 35:21.309
<i>they are just ni챰os trying
to release their wiggles.</i>

35:21.853 --> 35:25.152
Ignacio, they are wrestling
in a sacred place.

35:27.024 --> 35:31.290
Okay, orphans, listen to me.
Listen to Ignacio.

35:32.196 --> 35:34.027
I know it is fun to wrestle.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.660
A nice pile-drive to the face,

35:37.001 --> 35:38.798
or a punch to the face,

35:39.637 --> 35:41.400
but you cannot do it.

35:41.539 --> 35:45.202
Because it is in the Bible
not to wrestle your neighbor.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.339
So you've never wrestled?

35:47.578 --> 35:49.910
Me? No, come on. Don't be crazy.

35:50.748 --> 35:54.081
Listen, I know the wrestlers
get all the fancy ladies,

35:55.119 --> 35:56.484
and the clothes,

35:57.121 --> 35:59.749
and the free creams and lotions,

36:00.691 --> 36:02.420
but my life is good.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.426
Really good.

36:05.363 --> 36:09.561
I get to wake up every morning
at 5:00 a.m. And make some soup.

36:10.568 --> 36:13.093
It's the best. I love it.

36:14.238 --> 36:17.696
I get to lay in a bed by myself
all of my life.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.208
It's fantastic.

36:25.816 --> 36:26.805
Go.

36:27.318 --> 36:28.512
Go away!

36:29.587 --> 36:31.145
Read some books!

36:48.272 --> 36:50.502
Have you ever had feelings for a nun?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.335
No way.

36:57.014 --> 36:58.379
There is this nun.

37:00.151 --> 37:03.848
I just wish I could take off this robe
so she could see how strong I am.

37:03.955 --> 37:07.789
Well, bring her
to our next wrestling match.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.588
Yeah, right.

37:11.028 --> 37:13.462
Then I'll get kicked
out of the monastery.

37:18.636 --> 37:19.898
I have an idea.

37:20.938 --> 37:21.996
Tell me.

37:22.506 --> 37:24.337
Take her on a date tonight

37:24.675 --> 37:27.508
and I will bring some of my friends
to beat you up,

37:27.845 --> 37:29.608
but we will let you win.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.184
So where are you taking me?

37:38.289 --> 37:41.690
Well, Sister, I saw a bum here today.

37:42.059 --> 37:43.549
There were two bums,

37:43.794 --> 37:45.284
and I said to myself,

37:45.930 --> 37:48.694
"Let's talk to these guys
about the Gospel."

37:49.767 --> 37:51.234
Well, where are they?

37:52.703 --> 37:54.034
I don't see them.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.908
They should be coming by.

38:02.647 --> 38:04.706
Where is your robe, Ignacio?

38:06.817 --> 38:09.251
It was stinky.

38:09.587 --> 38:11.987
But these are my recreation clothes.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.758
- They look expensive.
- Thank you.

38:22.566 --> 38:23.828
I mean, yes,

38:24.902 --> 38:27.803
they may have
the appearance of riches,

38:27.972 --> 38:31.430
but beneath the clothes, we find a man.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.900
And beneath a man,

38:35.613 --> 38:39.606
we find his nucleus.

38:40.951 --> 38:43.419
- Nucleus?
- Yes.

38:46.791 --> 38:49.760
Listen, I don't like the way
those guys just looked at you.

38:51.028 --> 38:53.792
Hey! Can't you see this woman's a nun?

38:55.399 --> 38:57.697
And if you guys
have a problem with that,

38:57.802 --> 38:59.770
well, you can just fight me.

39:20.424 --> 39:21.482
Okay.

39:22.326 --> 39:23.588
You ready?

39:23.694 --> 39:25.889
You messed with
the wrong guy this time.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.861
You ever seen these moves? Huh?

39:28.399 --> 39:30.367
You see these moves? Huh?

39:30.468 --> 39:33.028
You think you gonna... Huh?

39:33.137 --> 39:35.765
- Come on!
- This way. I think he's over here.

39:53.858 --> 39:55.120
Surprise.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.651
Get that corn out of my face!

40:07.438 --> 40:09.303
Release! Release!

40:13.010 --> 40:16.275
I looked like a fool last night!
What took you so long?

40:21.152 --> 40:22.517
It's no use.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.750
I wanna be a great fighter,

40:25.389 --> 40:28.324
but I can't even beat
a couple of guys in the street.

40:39.904 --> 40:40.996
Nacho.

40:41.906 --> 40:44.466
I think I know someone
who can help you.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.338
- The Lord?
- No.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.739
He's a water gypsy.

40:49.146 --> 40:51.444
He know wheres to find eagle eggs.

40:51.549 --> 40:52.880
Eagle eggs?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.784
I'm not listening to you. You're crazy.

40:58.355 --> 41:01.518
Nacho, I'm telling you. This is for reals.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.094
His eagle eggs possess
magical powers.

41:08.032 --> 41:11.365
You could become the greatest fighter
who ever lived.

41:23.981 --> 41:28.475
In order for you to become empowered

41:29.386 --> 41:30.876
by the eagle,

41:31.889 --> 41:34.255
you must climb that cliff,

41:35.826 --> 41:37.817
find the egg,

41:38.295 --> 41:40.229
crack open one of them,

41:41.298 --> 41:43.459
and then swallow the yolk.

41:46.470 --> 41:48.335
So, what you're saying to me

41:49.240 --> 41:51.208
is if I can eat this yolk,

41:52.209 --> 41:55.474
my moves will become
the best in the whole worid.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.346
Definitely.

42:02.486 --> 42:03.783
High five.

43:36.013 --> 43:39.505
- Summon your eagle powers.
- What do you think I am doing?

44:15.686 --> 44:18.211
Eagle powers, come to me!

44:18.622 --> 44:19.748
Please!

44:57.027 --> 44:58.551
Tag. Tag! Tag!

45:25.189 --> 45:27.589
Those eggs were a lie, Steven.

45:28.258 --> 45:29.418
A lie!

45:30.494 --> 45:32.655
They gave me no eagle powers!

45:33.163 --> 45:35.188
They gave me no nutrients!

45:36.200 --> 45:37.326
Sorry.

45:43.340 --> 45:45.103
I don't want to get paid to lose.

45:45.809 --> 45:47.333
I want to win!

45:53.283 --> 45:55.251
I need professional help.

45:56.987 --> 45:58.454
I need Ramses.

45:59.857 --> 46:01.324
He's the best.

46:02.626 --> 46:05.186
We need to get in
with him and his buddies.

46:05.295 --> 46:07.263
We must learn their ways.

46:08.098 --> 46:11.727
But they are pros.
They only hang out with each other.

46:12.035 --> 46:13.764
Then we must go pro!

46:14.304 --> 46:17.831
But going pro is not that easy.
It's political, obviously.

46:18.809 --> 46:20.333
<i>My area, amigo.</i>

46:36.927 --> 46:38.451
You see that guy over there?

46:39.563 --> 46:41.497
<i>His name is Se챰or Ramon.</i>

46:42.800 --> 46:44.495
He's Ramses' manager

46:45.202 --> 46:47.602
and he owns all of the big arenas.

46:50.207 --> 46:52.607
He's having a party tomorrow night.

46:53.443 --> 46:56.310
We need to go and show him
we mean business,

46:56.547 --> 46:59.141
that we are ready for the big leagues.

47:01.418 --> 47:04.444
Over there in the tree
is a chipmunk nest.

47:05.422 --> 47:09.119
Here we have the corn.
The best in the city. It's delicious.

47:09.827 --> 47:13.160
That is where I get the day-old chips,
over in a secret place.

47:13.797 --> 47:15.765
And that is a crazy lady.

47:16.834 --> 47:20.702
So now you got a little taste
of what I do.

47:22.406 --> 47:24.670
It's pretty dang exciting, huh?

47:30.147 --> 47:31.307
Ramses!

47:36.553 --> 47:39.021
- How do you know him?
- He's the best.

47:39.122 --> 47:40.555
No, he's not.

47:45.562 --> 47:47.553
May I have his autograph?

47:49.399 --> 47:50.559
Please?

47:51.802 --> 47:54.032
Okay. Let me see what I can do.

48:07.384 --> 48:08.578
Ramses.

48:09.486 --> 48:10.851
How are you?

48:14.691 --> 48:15.680
Hi.

48:20.130 --> 48:23.657
I was wondering
if the children could get a

48:24.735 --> 48:27.465
signature from you and maybe a picture.

48:40.350 --> 48:42.215
Listen, the kids are orphans.

48:42.319 --> 48:45.311
They like you. You are the best.

48:57.501 --> 48:59.560
This party's gonna be crazy.

48:59.970 --> 49:02.063
I mean, we're gonna be pros.

49:04.608 --> 49:05.802
Feel it.

49:06.476 --> 49:09.138
Go on. I made them.

49:14.751 --> 49:16.082
Go lay down.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.949
Ignacio, I've been looking for you.

49:24.161 --> 49:26.425
- Where have you been?
- I've been here.

49:27.197 --> 49:28.892
I've been sleeping.

49:30.300 --> 49:32.495
In a frilly shirt and slacks?

49:33.170 --> 49:34.728
They are my PJs.

49:36.606 --> 49:38.073
Can I come in?

49:38.241 --> 49:41.768
No, people might get
the wrong idea about you.

49:43.246 --> 49:44.736
Like maybe you are a floozy.

49:47.845 --> 49:49.506
Ignacio, I was in the kitchen

49:49.613 --> 49:51.979
and there's no food
for tomorrow's breakfast.

49:52.082 --> 49:53.344
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

49:53.450 --> 49:54.678
- But when?
- Good night.

50:00.825 --> 50:03.225
Hey, let go my blouse.

50:03.427 --> 50:06.021
We are wrestlers, too. We are invited.

50:23.547 --> 50:26.038
- Give me a boost.
- Okay.

50:33.891 --> 50:35.882
Hey. What about me?

50:36.861 --> 50:38.920
I don't think I can lift you.

50:39.230 --> 50:40.788
You are too fat.

50:43.200 --> 50:44.497
Good luck.

51:14.765 --> 51:16.130
<i>Se챰or Ramon.</i>

51:17.368 --> 51:21.099
<i>- Who are you?
- I am Esqueleto, the luchador.</i>

51:22.673 --> 51:25.073
<i>Everybody is a luchador, mi amigo.</i>

51:26.010 --> 51:29.468
I think that me and my friend
are ready to go pro.

51:32.316 --> 51:36.184
Ramses, would you like to fight
this man in the ring?

51:39.323 --> 51:42.554
So you want to make a name
for yourself, horseface?

51:43.761 --> 51:45.922
Win the Battle Jam next week.

51:46.430 --> 51:50.025
The winner will fight Ramses
in exhibition

51:50.134 --> 51:53.160
in front of 5,000 people.

51:55.639 --> 51:57.539
Then you will be a pro.

53:32.436 --> 53:33.801
I forgive you.

53:37.107 --> 53:38.938
Come here, soldier.

53:39.443 --> 53:41.638
How did you get up here so fast?

53:43.680 --> 53:45.238
Secret tunnels.

53:52.990 --> 53:55.458
Some say wrestlers make bad lovers.

53:56.126 --> 53:59.527
That they save themselves for the ring.

54:08.338 --> 54:09.396
Huh?

54:10.507 --> 54:11.838
I love you.

54:28.659 --> 54:30.126
Sing!

54:30.394 --> 54:33.158
Sing something for Ramses!

54:35.332 --> 54:37.732
Okay, my friend, this one's yours.

54:37.968 --> 54:39.026
What?

54:39.503 --> 54:40.993
This one yours.

54:55.519 --> 55:00.422
<i>I am singing at the party</i>

55:02.359 --> 55:04.088
<i>I am singing</i>

55:04.194 --> 55:07.994
<i>It's my turn to sing at the party</i>

55:08.999 --> 55:11.024
<i>Everyone is dancing</i>

55:11.135 --> 55:14.036
<i>Happy party</i>

55:15.672 --> 55:20.507
<i>But Ramses is not dancing
He does not dance at the parties</i>

55:22.379 --> 55:26.543
<i>Ramses is number one
He knows the secrets of desire</i>

55:29.086 --> 55:33.113
<i>Ramses is the one
He puts the people all on fire</i>

55:35.559 --> 55:36.856
<i>Ramses</i>

55:47.037 --> 55:48.197
Steven!

55:49.273 --> 55:50.570
Come here.

55:59.216 --> 56:00.547
That party was lame.

56:01.251 --> 56:02.912
I hate that place.

56:08.725 --> 56:09.749
Hey!

56:18.802 --> 56:20.235
Take it easy.

56:58.609 --> 57:00.702
It sucks to be me right now!

57:04.781 --> 57:06.976
- How come?
- How come you think?

57:07.985 --> 57:11.352
I used to really like Ramses.
I wanted to become him.

57:12.489 --> 57:15.686
But it turns out he's a real douche.

57:17.427 --> 57:22.194
Well, win the Battle Jam this week
and you can fight him yourself.

57:32.776 --> 57:33.970
Forget it.

57:34.745 --> 57:35.837
What?

57:37.014 --> 57:39.482
Because I can't go on living a lie.

57:41.852 --> 57:43.410
Earth to Steven.

57:44.454 --> 57:45.853
I'm a friar.

57:46.890 --> 57:48.721
I'm not for that worid.

57:49.192 --> 57:53.219
The orphans, they need me,
and I have forsaken them.

57:54.364 --> 57:57.424
I got no groceries for breakfast
because of you!

57:57.534 --> 58:00.765
I'm sick of hearing
about your stupid orphans.

58:01.204 --> 58:04.765
- What did you just say?
- I hate orphans.

58:05.275 --> 58:08.403
- Say it again to my face.
- I hate them!

58:08.679 --> 58:09.805
Come again?

58:09.913 --> 58:12.677
I hate all the orphans
in the whole worid.

58:25.095 --> 58:27.063
I'm not listening to you.

58:27.931 --> 58:31.799
You only believe in science.
That's probably why we never win.

58:32.069 --> 58:33.969
We never win because you are fat.

58:48.085 --> 58:49.814
<i>Buenos d챠as, Sister.</i>

58:53.056 --> 58:54.751
So, what you cooking?

58:56.460 --> 58:57.757
Breakfast.

59:09.206 --> 59:12.835
Ignacio, you have a responsibility
to these children.

59:13.477 --> 59:14.637
I know.

59:16.747 --> 59:19.307
Well, where have you been?

59:20.250 --> 59:24.186
I've been gone because I had
a lot of church-y opportunities lately,

59:24.287 --> 59:25.982
outside of the orphanage.

59:26.990 --> 59:30.221
Like what? Where were you last night?

59:33.730 --> 59:37.666
To tell you the truth,
I went to a wrestling match.

59:40.637 --> 59:43.128
You went to watch a wrestling match?

59:46.810 --> 59:48.004
Kind of.

59:48.845 --> 59:50.904
You are a man of the cloth.

59:51.581 --> 59:53.515
<i>Lucha libre, it's a sin.</i>

59:54.418 --> 59:56.249
But why?

59:56.887 --> 59:59.754
Because those men fight for vanity,

01:00:00.357 --> 01:00:01.654
for money,

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:03.490
for false pride.

01:00:05.395 --> 01:00:07.761
Yes, it's terrible. Terrible.

01:00:09.433 --> 01:00:11.731
But is it always a sin to fight?

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:14.559
No.

01:00:16.773 --> 01:00:18.764
If you fight for something noble,

01:00:19.376 --> 01:00:21.844
or for someone who needs your help,

01:00:22.412 --> 01:00:25.074
only then will God bless you in battle.

01:00:28.885 --> 01:00:31.080
You must pray for forgiveness.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.393
Excuse me, Ignacio.

01:01:22.606 --> 01:01:24.198
<i>Precious Father,</i>

01:01:24.307 --> 01:01:27.174
<i>why have you given me
this desire to wrestle</i>

01:01:27.277 --> 01:01:29.871
<i>and then made me
such a stinky warrior?</i>

01:01:30.847 --> 01:01:35.307
<i>Have I focused too much on my boots
and all my fame and my stretchy pants?</i>

01:01:36.353 --> 01:01:37.445
<i>Wait a second.</i>

01:01:37.554 --> 01:01:40.523
<i>Maybe you want me to fight
and give everything I win</i>

01:01:40.624 --> 01:01:42.353
<i>to the little ones who have nothing</i>

01:01:42.459 --> 01:01:45.155
<i>so they can have better foods
and a better life.</i>

01:01:47.063 --> 01:01:48.655
<i>Yeah, maybe that.</i>

01:01:49.099 --> 01:01:52.068
<i>Okay, if I win tonight at the Battle Jam,</i>

01:01:52.202 --> 01:01:54.193
<i>I will know that you bless my missi처n</i>

01:01:54.304 --> 01:01:57.705
<i>and that you want me to be
a wrestling servant of you.</i>

01:01:59.976 --> 01:02:01.238
<i>I smell cookies.</i>

01:02:02.145 --> 01:02:03.373
Flame! Flame!

01:02:05.649 --> 01:02:08.641
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

01:02:12.889 --> 01:02:14.516
Roll, you fool!

01:02:21.097 --> 01:02:22.860
Flame, flame, flame!

01:02:53.496 --> 01:02:55.191
Yes, it's true!

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:59.393
<i>I am Nacho, the luchador.</i>

01:03:04.908 --> 01:03:05.932
Who?

01:03:06.176 --> 01:03:08.337
Maybe you have seen me on TV.

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:15.543
Nacho!

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.352
No. This is forbidden.

01:03:27.097 --> 01:03:28.394
I knew it.

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:31.533
He is not a man of God.

01:03:35.538 --> 01:03:36.732
Tonight,

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.041
I will fight
the seven strongest men in town,

01:03:40.443 --> 01:03:42.035
maybe the worid,

01:03:44.214 --> 01:03:45.738
and I will win

01:03:46.216 --> 01:03:49.708
because our Heavenly Father
will be in the ring with me.

01:03:49.886 --> 01:03:51.979
And he and I will win 10,000 pesos.

01:03:52.088 --> 01:03:53.487
And with it,

01:03:53.957 --> 01:03:56.949
I will buy the orphans a big bus

01:03:57.661 --> 01:04:00.721
to go on field trips to parks
and places like that.

01:04:01.398 --> 01:04:02.763
I'm serious!

01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:29.977
Nipple twist!

01:07:26.402 --> 01:07:28.267
You can't win them all.

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:42.276
Nacho!

01:07:43.553 --> 01:07:45.282
Where are you going?

01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:50.485
There is no place for me
in this worid, Chanchito.

01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:54.029
I don't belong out there

01:07:54.697 --> 01:07:56.756
and I don't belong in here,

01:07:57.367 --> 01:07:59.665
so I'm going into the wilderness,

01:07:59.836 --> 01:08:02.270
probably to die.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.631
Well, you might need this.

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:16.719
My mother gave it to me
before she died.

01:08:17.353 --> 01:08:20.845
<i>It was her lucky machete.
You can have it.</i>

01:08:38.006 --> 01:08:40.305
I hope to see you again, little Chancho.

01:08:44.147 --> 01:08:46.011
Maybe in the next life.

01:10:51.207 --> 01:10:53.175
How did you find me here?

01:10:53.743 --> 01:10:55.370
I saw you from the village.

01:11:07.857 --> 01:11:09.222
I have some news.

01:11:12.862 --> 01:11:15.524
Silencio isn't going to be able
to fight Ramses.

01:11:19.202 --> 01:11:20.692
He got injured.

01:11:43.826 --> 01:11:45.987
Silencio bruised his bunions.

01:11:46.295 --> 01:11:48.456
They are swollen really hard.

01:11:50.733 --> 01:11:53.395
He's not gonna be able to fight tonight.

01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:56.501
You were second place.

01:11:57.006 --> 01:11:58.940
You get to fight Ramses.

01:12:00.843 --> 01:12:03.038
But I have given up wrestling.

01:12:05.982 --> 01:12:08.883
Nacho, you are a great fighter.

01:12:09.986 --> 01:12:12.716
And you got something
none of these guys have.

01:12:22.999 --> 01:12:25.194
The childrens need a real hero.

01:12:26.903 --> 01:12:29.895
But I thought you hated
all the orphans in the whole worid.

01:12:32.141 --> 01:12:33.506
Not anymore.

01:12:34.143 --> 01:12:35.542
I like them.

01:12:38.347 --> 01:12:40.315
And they need you, Nacho.

01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:02.528
Okay.

01:13:41.711 --> 01:13:44.612
<i>Dear Sister, I know
you probably hate my guts by now</i>

01:13:44.714 --> 01:13:48.741
<i>and already believe that I must have
died long ago in the wilderness.</i>

01:13:48.851 --> 01:13:51.319
<i>But you are wrong, I'm still alive.</i>

01:13:51.821 --> 01:13:54.756
<i>Tonight I'll be fighting
the greatest wrestler who ever lived,</i>

01:13:54.857 --> 01:13:56.324
<i>the great Ramses.</i>

01:13:56.425 --> 01:13:57.756
<i>I know you don't like wrestling,</i>

01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:01.023
<i>but know that I am leaving
all my monies to the orphans.</i>

01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:05.396
<i>And if I die in the ring, know that
I always loved you as a brother in God.</i>

01:14:06.035 --> 01:14:07.263
<i>Ignacio.</i>

01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:12.637
<i>P.S. If we didn't end up taking
our vows of celibacy,</i>

01:14:13.009 --> 01:14:17.241
<i>we could maybe get married
and have a family with some ni챰os.</i>

01:14:18.247 --> 01:14:20.181
<i>But, you know, whatever.</i>

01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:23.475
<i>Hug, hug, kiss, kiss,</i>

01:14:23.653 --> 01:14:25.917
<i>hug, hug, big kiss,</i>

01:14:26.222 --> 01:14:30.056
<i>little hug, kiss, kiss, little kiss.</i>

01:15:19.241 --> 01:15:21.641
Ramses is the number one.

01:15:23.012 --> 01:15:25.810
His legs are number one.

01:15:26.549 --> 01:15:29.450
His eyes are number one.

01:15:30.252 --> 01:15:33.085
His muscles are number one.

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:37.291
Ramses is the number one.

01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:46.828
While I was in the wilderness

01:15:48.337 --> 01:15:50.532
I wrote a song for Encarnaci처n

01:15:53.042 --> 01:15:54.373
in my mind.

01:15:55.878 --> 01:15:58.369
- Shall I sing it for you?
- Sure.

01:16:09.792 --> 01:16:13.387
<i>When the fantasy has ended</i>

01:16:13.963 --> 01:16:16.955
<i>And all the children are gone</i>

01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:21.325
<i>Something good inside me</i>

01:16:21.937 --> 01:16:24.667
<i>Helps me to carry on</i>

01:16:24.774 --> 01:16:28.540
<i>I ate some bugs
I ate some grass</i>

01:16:28.644 --> 01:16:32.341
<i>I used my hand
To wipe my tears</i>

01:16:32.448 --> 01:16:36.384
<i>To kiss your mouth
I'd break my vow</i>

01:16:36.485 --> 01:16:40.080
<i>No, no, no
No, no, no way, Jos챕</i>

01:16:40.356 --> 01:16:42.483
<i>Unless you want to</i>

01:16:42.591 --> 01:16:46.652
<i>Then we'd break our vows together</i>

01:16:47.863 --> 01:16:52.232
<i>Encarnaci처n</i>

01:16:52.334 --> 01:16:55.599
<i>Encarnaci처n</i>

01:16:55.704 --> 01:16:58.229
<i>Encarnaci처n</i>

01:17:00.075 --> 01:17:03.567
<i>Encarnaci처n</i>

01:17:05.114 --> 01:17:06.843
They are ready for you now.

01:17:39.348 --> 01:17:42.840
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

01:18:04.707 --> 01:18:06.470
Maybe we should pray.

01:18:11.914 --> 01:18:16.317
Dear Lord, please bless Nacho
with nutrients and strength.

01:18:16.785 --> 01:18:18.184
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:18:18.988 --> 01:18:22.890
Ramses! Ramses! Ramses! Ramses!

01:18:28.697 --> 01:18:30.892
Ramses! Ramses!

01:18:48.317 --> 01:18:49.614
High five.

01:18:50.519 --> 01:18:51.952
Take it easy.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.325
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:20:16.472 --> 01:20:20.875
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

01:20:20.976 --> 01:20:23.069
Nacho! Nacho!

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:29.963
Okay. Vertebrae kick!

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.280
Timber!

01:23:58.594 --> 01:23:59.856
I did it!

01:24:26.021 --> 01:24:28.455
Hey! We did it!

01:24:29.825 --> 01:24:30.917
Yes!

01:24:59.388 --> 01:25:00.446
Yes!

01:25:00.923 --> 01:25:02.584
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:25:09.531 --> 01:25:10.862
Yes!
