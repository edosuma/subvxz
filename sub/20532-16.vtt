00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.711
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.713 --> 00:14.980
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.982 --> 00:17.716
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.052
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:20.054 --> 00:22.688
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.690 --> 00:25.557
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.559 --> 00:29.528
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:33.565
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.567 --> 00:36.568
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.570 --> 00:38.237
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.239 --> 00:40.672
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.674 --> 00:43.075
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.077 --> 00:45.577
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.579 --> 00:51.750
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:04.198 --> 01:08.167
And so ends our last
Protector meeting of the year.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.702
Happy Wassailia,
one and all.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.572
ALL: Happy Wassailia!

01:13.574 --> 01:16.608
Sofia, is everything
all right?

01:16.610 --> 01:19.611
Oh, I... I'm just
a little nervous.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.847
I hope Chrysta likes
the Wassailia gift I made her.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.582
I'm sure she'll love it.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.451
She's lucky to have you
as a trainee.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.919
Thanks.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.188
It's just,
Chrysta can be...

01:29.190 --> 01:30.789
A little grumpy
sometimes?

01:30.791 --> 01:31.790
Maybe a little.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.525
I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.128
Princess, there you are.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.930
Happy Wassailia,
princess.

01:37.932 --> 01:41.033
Oh, wow.
Happy Wassailia, Chrysta.

01:41.035 --> 01:43.569
It's my favorite
day of the year,

01:43.571 --> 01:45.370
'cause on
the Mystic Isles,

01:45.372 --> 01:48.774
Wassailia is
full of surprises.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.609
I'm already surprised.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.444
I didn't know you liked
Wassailia so much.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.813
Do you have any idea
how we celebrate around here?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.381
Uh... no.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.749
Tell the girl, Galial.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.718
Well, on
the Isle of Centaurs,

01:59.720 --> 02:02.387
they hold a big
Wassailia Day race.

02:02.389 --> 02:03.889
And on
the Isle of Fauns--

02:03.891 --> 02:05.724
Turon's family plays
music together

02:05.726 --> 02:07.626
under the Wassailia moon.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.661
And on Garish's Isle,

02:09.663 --> 02:12.831
all the giants come
thundering over the hills
to his house.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.502
- Yep, where we do
what giants do best.
- What is that?

02:16.504 --> 02:19.171
Bake cookies, of course.
Who wants one?

02:19.173 --> 02:20.906
- I'll take one, Garish.
- Me, too.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.508
( laughs )
Here you go.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.976
Uh...

02:23.978 --> 02:25.677
Uh, thanks.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.312
This is big.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.916
Like I said,
full of surprises. Mm!

02:32.520 --> 02:34.186
Speaking of surprises--

02:34.188 --> 02:36.455
Apologies, everyone,
but we've just heard.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.123
There's trouble
on one of the isles.

02:38.125 --> 02:41.660
We need a Protector
to volunteer this Wassailia Eve.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.662
- Oh, I'll do it.
- But Chrysta,

02:43.664 --> 02:46.832
- don't you have
holiday plans?
- Of course I do.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.435
Every year, my whole family
squeezes into my little cottage

02:50.437 --> 02:52.104
for a fairy feast.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.273
But that's not for hours.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.842
And Chrysta always
volunteers on Wassailia.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.878
Well, I am
the number one Protector.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.713
Fill me in, chiefs.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.317
Chrysta volunteers on
Wassailia every year?

03:05.319 --> 03:07.986
That doesn't seem fair.
Can't you all take turns?

03:07.988 --> 03:10.522
We've tried, but
you know Chrysta.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.324
You can't argue
with her.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.359
Hm. Then maybe I'll
go along.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.695
Have fun with that.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.131
Not to worry.
I'll do you both proud.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.567
And so will I.
Chrysta, I'm
coming with you,

03:21.569 --> 03:24.169
- and I won't take
no for an answer.
- Great.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.971
We'll work together
and get back

03:25.973 --> 03:27.172
in plenty of time
for both of our...

03:27.174 --> 03:28.373
Wait, what did you say?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.242
I said great.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.077
It's Wassailia.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.579
The more, the merrier.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.347
Now call your
unicorn friend.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.183
We gotta get to
the Isle of Rompkins,
and quick.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.818
Happy Wassailia.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.256
Ah, what a day!

03:44.258 --> 03:46.258
I hope it snows.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.260
I love making
snow fairies.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.861
Chrysta's in
a good mood.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.497
Yeah. She really
likes Wassailia.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.666
Which reminds me.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.702
Here's a little
something for you, Skye.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.503
Molasses
and peppermint.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.572
My favorite!

04:00.574 --> 04:02.507
Thanks for helping
on the holiday.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.443
I hope it doesn't
take too long.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.678
Never fear,
my princess.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.348
'Twill be hours before
the sun sets over
Starmane Hill,

04:09.350 --> 04:12.217
when my herd displays
their holiday ice sculptures.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.119
That sounds beautiful.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.855
One side!
Deliveries coming through!

04:16.857 --> 04:18.757
Look out, Elfalfa.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.293
Sorry about that, Skye.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.962
Chrysta, I got a ton
of packages,

04:23.964 --> 04:26.431
and this year, oh ho,
I am determined

04:26.433 --> 04:28.433
to stay on schedule.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.036
- Who is that?
- That is Elfalfa,

04:31.038 --> 04:34.439
the elf who delivers
gifts between the isles
every Wassailia.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.808
And every year,
there are more.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.543
I've got gifts
from the trolls

04:38.545 --> 04:40.445
that need to go
to the centaurs,

04:40.447 --> 04:41.980
and from the fauns
to the giants,

04:41.982 --> 04:43.882
and... who are you?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.585
I'm Sofia.
Nice to meet you.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.787
Sofia?
Sofia.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.889
You must be new.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.959
So Elfalfa, you gonna
need my help again this year?

04:53.961 --> 04:56.962
No. This year,
I've got a helper.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.998
My daughter,
Elfabetty.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.300
( giggles )

05:01.302 --> 05:03.568
Gifts, candy!

05:03.570 --> 05:05.170
Not for you, Elfabetty.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.905
Awww.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.641
Isn't she the cutest?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.243
Don't worry, Chrysta.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.812
This year, I've got it
completely under control.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.014
Don't grab the reins,
Elfabetty!

05:16.016 --> 05:17.382
Don't grab the reins!

05:19.920 --> 05:21.687
Is he going
to be okay?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.121
Probably not.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.856
Now buckle up, princess.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.458
We're here.
Get ready for...

05:26.460 --> 05:29.828
I know.
Some serious
Protector business.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.030
Right. Of course.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.000
But first,
some holiday fun.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.709
Princess Sofia,
it's horrible.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.510
What happened, Harumph?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.679
Our Wassailia tree
got stolen.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.182
- Poof!
- Whoosh, gone.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.018
- While we were sleeping.
- That's awful.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.320
Yeah, and we were
really looking forward

05:55.322 --> 05:57.489
to having our first
dainty holiday,

05:57.491 --> 05:59.858
like you and Queen Amber
taught us.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.028
But without a tree,
what will we stand around

06:03.030 --> 06:05.697
while we sip
Slog Nog?

06:05.699 --> 06:06.898
Want a cup?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.800
Yes, please.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.869
To Wassailia!

06:10.871 --> 06:13.038
ALL: Wassailia!

06:13.040 --> 06:14.172
( loud slurping )

06:14.174 --> 06:16.575
Mmm, extra crunchy.

06:16.577 --> 06:20.178
It's the dried moss.
You sure you don't
want a cup?

06:20.180 --> 06:23.749
I would, but I think I should
start looking for clues.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.183
( gasps )

06:25.185 --> 06:26.918
Like that.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.320
It's our tree.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.921
It wasn't stolen.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.323
It fleweth away.

06:31.325 --> 06:33.024
Not yet, it hasn't.

06:33.026 --> 06:36.161
Princess, after
that evergreen!

06:37.898 --> 06:39.498
No time to be dainty.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.566
Bam, crash!

06:44.004 --> 06:46.438
Do you have a lot of
flying trees in
the Mystic Isles?

06:46.440 --> 06:47.906
First one
I've ever seen.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.611
SOFIA: Whoa!

06:53.914 --> 06:55.313
It stopped on its own.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.084
Huff, puff.

06:59.086 --> 07:03.889
Hey, this is where
I found the tree
in the first place.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.624
Well, it's all yours.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.192
You know what this
calls for?

07:07.194 --> 07:09.628
An upside down
holiday cake?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.863
Yum.

07:13.634 --> 07:17.068
- Hey, what's that?
- CHRYSTA: What's what?

07:17.070 --> 07:19.604
Something I think we should
take a closer look at.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.139
Harumph, um...

07:21.141 --> 07:23.408
where did you get
those ornaments?

07:23.410 --> 07:25.377
Oh, they grow
right on the branches.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.145
Sproing!

07:27.147 --> 07:29.448
Isn't it the best
Wassailia tree ever?

07:29.450 --> 07:31.249
It just might be.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.318
I wish to be small.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.422
Uh, Sofia?

07:37.424 --> 07:39.991
- Since when
can you shrink?
- I'll be right back.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.393
Sofia, wait.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.895
( exasperated sigh )
Trainees.

07:46.767 --> 07:47.999
Hi there.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.368
Don't be afraid.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.406
I'm Sofia.
Who are you?

07:54.408 --> 07:56.508
I'm Humbelle.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.243
And I'm Hidey.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.011
We are Hoodwinks.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.980
And please
don't hurt us.

08:01.982 --> 08:02.981
I won't.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.749
I'm a Protector-in-training.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.251
I'm here to help you.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.520
Yeah? Tell that to
your big, huge friend.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.622
He stole our home.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.691
Your home?
You mean this tree?

08:12.693 --> 08:15.494
Yeah. We live in
this spruce out in
the middle of nowhere.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.995
Where it's safe.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.631
It's okay.
Just tell me what happened.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.600
All we know is,
one minute,

08:21.602 --> 08:23.635
we were safe in
our branch asleep.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.204
And the next,
we woke up in
a Rompkin mud garden,

08:26.206 --> 08:30.141
surrounded by
big, scary monsters,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.277
smashing and crashing
everything!

08:32.279 --> 08:33.645
That does sound scary.

08:33.647 --> 08:37.015
It's okay, Hidey.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.284
There you go.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.219
So I came up with
an escape plan.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.455
We waited until
the Rompkins weren't looking,

08:43.457 --> 08:45.524
and then, with
the rest of our family,

08:45.526 --> 08:48.059
we each grabbed a branch
and flew our tree home.

08:48.061 --> 08:51.363
I think there's been
a big misunderstanding.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.031
Oh, there sure has.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.400
That big galoot
mistook us for pushovers.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.036
Which we...
kind of are.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.372
But we're not
giving up our home.

09:00.374 --> 09:04.009
- We might.
- ALL: He's right,
we might.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.145
Look, I know Rompkins
are big and loud,

09:07.147 --> 09:09.314
but if you just
talk to Harumph,

09:09.316 --> 09:11.483
you'll see that
he's not scary at all.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.184
- He's--
- Right behind you.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.320
Hello,
talking ornaments.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.188
( all shrieking )

09:17.190 --> 09:18.823
What did I say?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.158
These are Hoodwinks,
Harumph.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.027
This tree is their home.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.728
That's right,
it is our home.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.498
Oh, no.
Hoodwinks, I'm so sorry.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
You are?

09:28.502 --> 09:32.571
We Rompkins would never
wanna take away anybody's home.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.005
Really?

09:34.007 --> 09:37.242
We just wanted
the best Wassailia tree,

09:37.244 --> 09:39.444
and yours
was so beautiful.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.280
But we don't need...

09:42.282 --> 09:44.516
such a nice one.

09:44.518 --> 09:49.187
My family can celebrate
around something else instead.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.222
Like a rock.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.191
( crying )
Sob!

09:54.394 --> 09:56.962
ALL: Awww.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.298
Harumph, wait.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.101
Hoodwinks, if the Rompkins
promise not to take your tree,

10:03.103 --> 10:05.103
could they celebrate
with your family here?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.439
( all whispering )

10:09.876 --> 10:11.309
Okay, you tell him.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.144
Yes, they can.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.146
Oh, laaa!

10:15.148 --> 10:18.316
That's my heart singing!

10:18.318 --> 10:19.851
( laughing )

10:21.755 --> 10:23.555
We'll be very dainty.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.657
I promise.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.892
Let's make a place
fit for a party.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.561
Yay!

10:41.108 --> 10:42.340
Oooh!

10:42.342 --> 10:44.275
I'm pretty!

10:44.277 --> 10:46.277
Like a tree!

10:46.279 --> 10:47.979
We did it, Chrysta.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.782
You sure did, princess.
Nice work.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.785
So I guess we can both
get an early start home, right?

10:53.787 --> 10:54.786
Chrysta?

10:54.788 --> 10:56.287
What are you doing?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.922
I'm decorating.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.492
Look. A glowing garland.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.294
But I thought you had
to get back to your family.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.296
There's plenty
of time.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.432
- Join me.
- Okay.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.841
You're good at this.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.710
Do you decorate your home?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.345
Oh, yeah, you should
see my cottage.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.347
Lights of every color.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.015
The brightest house
in the village.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.984
My brothers and sisters
help me.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.519
- Sounds beautiful.
- It is.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.621
Now let's hang some
way up...

11:29.623 --> 11:31.523
Right.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.725
Still on duty.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.996
What's up, chief?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.631
<i> It's Elfalfa.</i>

11:39.633 --> 11:41.800
<i> He has fallen behind</i>
<i> again in his deliveries,</i>

11:41.802 --> 11:43.334
<i> and needs your help.</i>

11:43.336 --> 11:44.803
Yeah, I could
see that coming.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.371
Where is he?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.907
<i> Well, by now, he should</i>
<i> be right behind you.</i>

11:50.010 --> 11:51.409
Oh, Elfabetty!

11:51.411 --> 11:53.511
Daddy needs his eyes
to land.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.213
( gasping )

11:55.215 --> 11:56.981
Elfabetty!

12:08.929 --> 12:11.596
Well, hello, Chrysta.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.699
Remember when I said I had it
all under control this year?

12:14.701 --> 12:18.403
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't.
I need your help.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.338
That's what
Protectors are for.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.240
You don't seem
so behind.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.275
You hardly have
any gifts left.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.412
Oh, ho. These aren't
the gifts I need
you to deliver.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.347
Those are.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.618
Wow.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.087
Here's the who, the what,
and the where to deliver to.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.622
All these places.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.924
This is going
to take a while.

12:39.926 --> 12:43.762
Yeah, but we'll get to
see Wassailia on all
the different isles.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.564
Come on, let's
have some fun.

12:46.566 --> 12:50.201
Give your magical hooves
a rest, my good reindeer.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.338
Skye the unicorn
hath it from here.

12:54.808 --> 12:58.276
SOFIA: First delivery,
the Isle of Crystal.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.446
CHRYSTA: I love
the Isle of Crystal
during Wassailia.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.648
All of the lights
reflected in the crystals,

13:03.650 --> 13:05.950
and, oh, we're in time
for Azurine's

13:05.952 --> 13:07.585
Singing Crystal concert.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.488
Wow, that is beautiful,

13:10.490 --> 13:13.224
but Chrysta,
I'm a little worried.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.492
It's getting late,

13:14.494 --> 13:16.728
and our families will
be waiting for us.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.830
Don't worry.
Enjoy it all!

13:18.832 --> 13:22.667
That's what
Wassailia is for!

13:22.669 --> 13:26.671
¶ There's no other day
quite like Wassailia ¶

13:26.673 --> 13:29.507
¶ You won't believe
your eyes ¶

13:29.509 --> 13:32.510
¶ Wanna see what I mean? ¶

13:32.512 --> 13:34.345
¶ Visit good Azurine ¶

13:34.347 --> 13:41.286
¶ Her magic crystals
harmonize ¶

13:41.288 --> 13:43.521
Encore!

13:43.523 --> 13:47.358
¶ There's no other day
the unicorns gather ¶

13:47.360 --> 13:49.394
¶ To carve up blocks of ice ¶

13:51.364 --> 13:55.333
¶ Just imagine the fun
when they all sculpt as one ¶

13:55.335 --> 14:00.939
¶ To make a slice
of paradise ¶

14:00.941 --> 14:05.043
¶ We are known in these parts
for our magical arts ¶

14:05.045 --> 14:08.646
¶ Today that's
specially the case ¶

14:08.648 --> 14:10.448
¶ But the miracle here ¶

14:10.450 --> 14:12.350
¶ Is friends far and near ¶

14:12.352 --> 14:16.354
¶ Come celebrate
in the same place ¶

14:16.356 --> 14:18.189
¶ That really sounds great ¶

14:18.191 --> 14:20.491
¶ But we're gonna be late ¶

14:20.493 --> 14:25.530
¶ As soon as I fix
his snow face ¶

14:25.532 --> 14:30.468
¶ There's no other day
to see mermaids frolic ¶

14:30.470 --> 14:33.571
¶ They rarely come ashore ¶

14:33.573 --> 14:37.809
¶ But watch us shake a fin
as we swim with our kin ¶

14:37.811 --> 14:42.413
¶ That is what
Wassailia's for ¶

14:42.415 --> 14:51.189
¶ Yes, that is what
Wassailia's for ¶

14:51.191 --> 14:52.590
Chrysta.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.492
I know.
We have to go.

14:54.494 --> 14:58.363
¶ But I just wanna say
on this holiday ¶

14:58.365 --> 15:00.231
¶ No matter the weather ¶

15:00.233 --> 15:02.233
¶ We all come together ¶

15:02.235 --> 15:08.239
¶ 'Cause that is just ¶

15:08.241 --> 15:16.447
¶ What Wassailia's for ¶

15:16.449 --> 15:20.585
SKYE: That was the last
package, my ladies.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.888
See, Sofia? I told you
there was plenty of time.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.090
I guess you
were right.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.426
Now, I don't know
about you,

15:28.428 --> 15:30.628
but I'm ready for
some holiday home cooking.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.797
Mmm. I can almost taste
the plum bread

15:32.799 --> 15:35.199
and banana pudding.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.435
Oh, you like
banana pudding?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.604
Do I? Mmm-hmm.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.473
There's nothing I love more
than homemade banana pudding

15:42.475 --> 15:44.442
on Wassailia;
it's my favorite!

15:44.444 --> 15:47.845
Speaking of which
I forgot to give you...

15:48.782 --> 15:51.282
<i> Chrysta, it's Elfalfa.</i>

15:51.284 --> 15:53.284
We know, he was
behind schedule,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.453
but we've delivered
all the packages.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.988
<i> No, it's not</i>
<i> the packages.</i>

15:56.990 --> 15:58.589
<i> It's his daughter,</i>
<i> Elfabetty.</i>

15:58.591 --> 16:00.325
<i> They were delivering</i>
<i> a package</i>

16:00.327 --> 16:01.626
<i> on the Isle of</i>
<i> Forever Frost,</i>

16:01.628 --> 16:03.728
<i> and now,</i>
<i> she's lost in a storm.</i>

16:03.730 --> 16:06.864
- We're on it.
- Let's hurry.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.771
Look. There.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.573
There he is.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.778
Chrysta, Sofia.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.981
I can't find Elfabetty.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.849
I thought she was
right here

16:24.851 --> 16:26.617
napping under this blanket,

16:26.619 --> 16:28.486
and when I looked,
she'd vanished.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.654
When did you
see her last?

16:29.656 --> 16:32.690
When we delivered a package
to the Arcticondors.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.425
She must've crawled
out of the sleigh

16:34.427 --> 16:36.494
while I was inside
their cave.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.529
I know them. I know
where their cave is.

16:38.531 --> 16:42.300
So do I, but with the storm,
I can't tell where I'm going.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.868
What do we do?

16:43.870 --> 16:45.536
What a Protector
always does.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.006
Bring a little light
to the situation.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.776
Yes, that is
a little light.

16:51.778 --> 16:55.847
Perhaps my ladies
would like a whole lot more.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.389
Stay close.
We're almost there.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.025
If you say so.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.235
Elfabetty!

17:17.237 --> 17:20.238
Elfabetty.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.707
Oh, Stormy, have you
seen Elfabetty?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.642
We can't find her
anywhere.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.745
Sorry, we haven't seen her,
not since you left.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.580
Oh, where could
she be?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.749
Don't worry.
I'm sure she's okay.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.753
My friend, we'll search
the whole isle if we have to.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.688
Please hurry.
We must find her.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.291
Let's search
the forest below.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.429
( giggling )

17:44.431 --> 17:45.897
Hold on.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.833
I think we're in for
another Wassailia surprise.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.535
Candy!

17:50.537 --> 17:52.103
Elfabetty!

17:52.105 --> 17:54.338
Oh, thank goodness!

17:54.340 --> 17:56.174
Oh, you silly girl.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.409
Did you climb in there
when Daddy wasn't looking

17:58.411 --> 17:59.777
to find some candy?

17:59.779 --> 18:02.213
Now I have a tummy ache.

18:02.215 --> 18:05.416
You take her home.
We'll deliver your
last gifts.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.252
It's all right.
These are all for her.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.521
How can I ever
thank you?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.090
I know.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.292
Next year,
you're both getting

18:14.294 --> 18:16.727
a nice delivery
from me.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.695
I can't wait.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.399
Farewell!

18:21.401 --> 18:26.404
And oh ho,
happy Wassailia to everyone!

18:26.406 --> 18:28.806
It's over.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.476
Yeah, I guess it is.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.644
That's it for Wassailia
for another year.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.646
What do you mean?
It's just begun.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.249
Now you can go home
to all your brothers
and sisters.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.118
Yes, of course.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.686
But just in case.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.455
Anything else, chief?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.057
<i> All is quiet.</i>

18:46.059 --> 18:47.658
<i> Thank you both.</i>

18:47.660 --> 18:49.393
<i> Go. Enjoy your holiday.</i>

18:51.297 --> 18:53.764
Okay, then, uh...

18:53.766 --> 18:56.167
bye.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.268
Huh?

18:57.270 --> 19:00.271
Happy Wassailia,
Chrysta.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.407
Are you ready to return
to the Ever Realm,
my princess?

19:03.409 --> 19:05.643
Skye, is it
my imagination,

19:05.645 --> 19:08.746
or was Chrysta
acting a little strangely?

19:08.748 --> 19:09.780
I did not notice.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.682
But whatever ails her,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.484
I trust she will soon
be cured by

19:13.486 --> 19:15.520
a little caroling
and opening of gifts.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.321
My gift.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.991
Oh, I forgot to give it
to Chrysta.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.160
Skye, what do you say
we drop the sleigh off,

19:22.162 --> 19:24.328
and take one last ride
to Chrysta's house?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.963
'Tis my honor.

19:25.965 --> 19:29.200
On to the Isle of Fairies.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.775
Which cottage
is Chrysta's?

19:37.777 --> 19:39.810
I think
it's that one.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.779
Chrysta
lives there?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.948
But where are
all the lights
and decorations

19:43.950 --> 19:45.750
she told us about?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.324
I am perplexed.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.992
Where is
Chrysta's family?

19:54.994 --> 19:57.061
I don't know.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.069
Sofia, what are you
doing here?

20:05.071 --> 20:07.171
I forgot
to give you this.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.973
I made it myself.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.075
Oh.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.977
Thanks.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.712
Happy Wassailia.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.148
Chrysta, wait.
May I come in?

20:17.150 --> 20:18.516
Oh, um...

20:18.518 --> 20:20.818
it's really not
the best time.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.887
Okay. Fine.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.722
Is everything okay?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.190
Where is your family?

20:26.192 --> 20:27.758
Your brothers and sisters?

20:27.760 --> 20:28.993
All the decorations
you told me about?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.895
Oh, uh...

20:30.897 --> 20:32.897
they should be here
any minute.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.265
Chrysta.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.934
Okay, okay.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.070
The truth is,

20:39.072 --> 20:40.705
I don't have
a family.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.939
I spend Wassailia alone.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.574
But it's fine.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.509
I mean, I'm usually
so tired

20:45.511 --> 20:47.245
from spending the day
making sure

20:47.247 --> 20:49.046
all the other isles
are taken care of,

20:49.048 --> 20:50.948
and, you know,
it's fine.

20:50.950 --> 20:54.051
Is that why you always
volunteer on Wassailia,

20:54.053 --> 20:56.087
so you can celebrate
with everyone else?

20:56.089 --> 21:00.358
What? Sofia, now you're
just being ridiculous.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.126
I like to come home

21:02.128 --> 21:04.729
after a long day
of Wassailia protecting

21:04.731 --> 21:06.530
and kick my feet up.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.199
No one to bother me.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.967
I can just relax.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.969
But no one should
be alone on Wassailia.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.938
You should come to
Enchancia and spend it

21:13.940 --> 21:15.640
with me and my family.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.375
Just because you
feel bad for me?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.210
No, thanks.

21:19.212 --> 21:20.778
It's not that.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.114
Listen, princess,
I'm a Protector.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.949
I help people;
I don't need people
to help me.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.651
But...

21:26.653 --> 21:28.586
I did what I do
every year.

21:28.588 --> 21:29.920
I celebrate on
all the different isles.

21:29.922 --> 21:33.424
Now I'm fine
by myself.

21:33.426 --> 21:36.894
So please, go home
to your family.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.932
Well, my princess,
at least you tried.

21:41.934 --> 21:43.934
She's got it all wrong.

21:43.936 --> 21:47.138
I wasn't inviting her
because I felt bad for her.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.007
It's just, she's done
so much for me.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.942
And for many others.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.611
That's right.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.613
So many.
Come on, Skye.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.915
- Where are we going?
- Everywhere.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.617
Princesses.

22:33.619 --> 22:36.020
( music playing )

22:36.022 --> 22:37.521
What's going on?

22:37.523 --> 22:39.690
Where is that music
coming from?

22:44.697 --> 22:45.896
No. No, no, no, no.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.865
You don't need to do this.
I'm fine.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.668
You should all go,
be with your families.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.870
But don't you see,
Chrysta?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.672
You helped us all today.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.040
And every day.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.642
And that makes you
our family.

22:58.644 --> 23:01.045
Well, what do you know?

23:01.047 --> 23:04.181
Another
Wassailia surprise.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.717
Thank you all.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.986
I'd invite you in,

23:08.988 --> 23:11.589
if I had something
to serve everybody.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.525
Will plum bread
and banana pudding do?

23:14.527 --> 23:16.594
It was Sofia's suggestion.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.597
( gasps )
They're my favorites.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.500
Thank you, Sofia.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.735
Happy Wassailia, Chrysta.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.438
You know what?
It is.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.341
Well...

23:30.343 --> 23:32.176
what are you all
sitting around for?

23:32.178 --> 23:34.745
Come on in, everybody.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.947
Let the party begin!

23:36.949 --> 23:39.083
Yay! Happy Wassailia!
