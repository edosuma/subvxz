what's been decided.

yourself a decision.

You know
why you're doing it?

Because when you take the life
of your commanding officer,
you should know.

- Finish it.
- You don't want me
to kill him.

Does this make you
a better warrior?

to help Betsy,

just a way to keep me

he gave his life for mine.

How do you repay that?

40:55.854 --> 40:57.889
Only a life
for a life will do.

But that's a debt
between me and him, not you.
