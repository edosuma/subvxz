<i>BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.200 --> 00:08.965
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.120 --> 00:11.600
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:11.760 --> 00:14.331
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:14.920 --> 00:17.526
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

00:17.680 --> 00:19.842
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

00:20.040 --> 00:22.088
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

00:22.400 --> 00:23.970
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

00:24.120 --> 00:26.805
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

00:27.040 --> 00:29.486
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

00:29.680 --> 00:31.603
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:32.759 --> 00:34.683
CISCO: Previously on The Flash...

00:35.080 --> 00:36.684
<i>JESSE QUICK: Grodd, he's got my dad.</i>

00:36.840 --> 00:38.922
Harry's my friend.
I'm not gonna just abandon him.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.447
<i>I'm going back to Earth-2.</i>

00:40.640 --> 00:43.291
Now I am the ruler of Gorilla City,

00:43.480 --> 00:46.131
and all the gorillas will follow
anything I order.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.884
Grodd, the gorilla?
He's talking through Wells?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.087
Yeah.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.765
Who is this gorgeous intruder?

00:50.920 --> 00:53.366
Her name is Gypsy. She's a collector.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.726
Open a breach!

00:54.880 --> 00:56.484
Time to warp out of this madhouse.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.324
<i>GRODD". You will open the breaches,</i>

00:58.480 --> 01:02.690
<i>and Central City will fall before Grodd.</i>

01:08.680 --> 01:10.364
-(WHIZZING)
-(CLATTERING)

01:10.520 --> 01:11.851
- Barry.
-(BELL DINGS)

01:12.160 --> 01:14.162
- BARRY: Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.328
You're in a good mood
for 6:30 in the morning.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.244
Yes, lam. Was I too loud?

01:20.400 --> 01:21.640
I did make breakfast.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.690
We got pancakes and waffles,
some French toast,

01:24.840 --> 01:26.330
bacon and sausage, perfectly cooked.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.525
And I picked up some of that dark roast
that you love so much.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.769
Barry Allen, what has gotten into you?

01:33.160 --> 01:35.083
Being with you makes me
want to do things like this.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.285
Come here.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.330
- I love you.
-(CHUCKLES)

01:47.280 --> 01:48.486
I love you.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.563
Um, so do you actually want
any of this, or...

01:52.720 --> 01:54.449
Um, yes.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.564
And some of the food, too.

01:57.920 --> 01:58.921
Yeah.

02:00.640 --> 02:01.687
Whoa.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.041
<i>Nice.</i>

02:10.320 --> 02:12.800
What are you doing?

02:13.720 --> 02:16.690
(CHUCKLES) Ah! I'm decorating.
Look at this place.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.051
- You're decorating the speed lab?
-Yes, I'm decorating the speed lab.

02:21.240 --> 02:25.165
You know, 'cause Francisco, you know,
he wouldn't let me decorate the cortex

02:25.320 --> 02:27.721
'cause I made it look oh-so-jolly
for Christmas time.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.290
- What are the balls for?
-Do you know what those are? Lanterns.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.851
You know what I always say,

02:33.080 --> 02:35.242
"A fellow that can't tell the difference
between balls and lanterns

02:35.400 --> 02:37.084
"is in trouble when the lights go out."

02:39.080 --> 02:40.081
Oh!

02:41.560 --> 02:43.881
You go front to back. Toothbrushing.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.247
You go front to back?
'Cause I'm a small-circles kind of guy.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.164
I wonder how the other Wells
brushes his teeth.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.601
The murderer?

02:49.760 --> 02:52.650
I'm fascinated by the subtle differences
between us, you know?

02:52.800 --> 02:54.802
- And the not-so-subtle ones.
-Like what?

02:54.960 --> 02:58.282
Like the fact that I'm a genius,
and you're a moron.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.649
Okay. See you at the party.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.131
Wow, what a transformation.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.890
Again.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.807
So, this is H.R.'s contribution
to the team,

03:23.480 --> 03:24.766
being Martha Stewart?

03:25.440 --> 03:27.169
Guys, he's just trying
to do something nice.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.288
- Heads up!
-(BOW TWANGS)

03:30.000 --> 03:32.890
I'm not really good with this kind
of thing. You know what I've got to do?

03:33.040 --> 03:35.122
I've got to take some lessons
from that guy in the green elf suit

03:35.280 --> 03:37.248
-over there in Star City. What's his name?
-BARRY: Green Arrow.

03:37.520 --> 03:41.241
-(STUTTERS) What is all this?
-Friends Day. Ta-da!

03:41.560 --> 03:43.642
- What?
-Yeah. Friends Day.

03:43.960 --> 03:44.961
"Friends"?

03:45.280 --> 03:47.965
Oh. It's my Earth's equivalent
of Valentine's Day.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.925
And I thought, like, after, you know,
our success with the gorillas,

03:51.120 --> 03:53.009
that we should, like, celebrate the love.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.606
- Was all this necessary?
-Yeah, Joe.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.569
Speaking of, where is your lady friend?

03:57.720 --> 03:59.927
-'Cause I'd like to--
-No, you wouldn't like to do anything.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.402
She's at work,
which is where I should be going.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.721
Yeah. I...

04:03.920 --> 04:05.331
<i>H.R.: Look what I have,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

04:05.480 --> 04:08.290
I have your own personal Friends Day card.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.120
- For yours truly, Ms. West.
-Thank you, H.R.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.601
- Captain. The leader of the ship.
-Thanks, H.R. Thank you.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.807
You're so welcome.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.367
Oh, hi, Jesse So Quick.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.485
Yeah, 'cause I also made one
for your grumpy old dad.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.404
- Ah, you know what I like? Your vibe.
-Thank you.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.167
Caitlin. Oh. I forgot the coffee.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.764
(SIGHS) "You have sped into my heart,
Jesse Quick."

04:32.960 --> 04:35.042
Oh, well, I guess that makes two of us.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.362
Uh, H.R. is nothing like my dad.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.247
He's so sweet and thoughtful
and understanding.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.044
- We should tell him.
-Tell your dad about you moving here?

04:46.200 --> 04:47.850
- Yeah.
-Um, now?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.889
Yeah, I mean,
H.R. said there'd never be a perfect time.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.725
- Just got to rip the Band-Aid off.
-Yeah.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.206
- Okay, let's do it.
-Okay.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.290
- H.R. does make a good point.
-Yeah, what's that?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.961
It was a really big win for the team,
beating Grodd.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.851
I mean, we stopped a gorilla attack
from happening.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.570
Yeah, look at you, changing the future.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.883
We're all changing the future,
one headline at a time.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.527
Look, I don't know
what the future's gonna bring,

05:11.800 --> 05:13.245
but I hope every day is with you,

05:13.800 --> 05:15.564
which is why I wanted to ask you,

05:16.720 --> 05:18.085
Barry Allen,

05:18.960 --> 05:21.042
-will you be my friend?
-Always.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.406
(IRIS WEST CHUCKLES)

05:27.560 --> 05:28.721
Hey-

05:29.240 --> 05:30.321
Hey-

05:31.000 --> 05:32.411
H.R. made this for you.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.763
H. R. is an idiot.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.164
So there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.521
Okay.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.604
- So I'm just gonna say it.
-I think that's wise.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.805
I'm gonna move to Earth-1.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.810
-(CLEARS THROAT) What?
-I'm gonna stay here.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.651
Why would you do that?
Grodd is no longer a threat.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.968
No, it's not that. Uh...

06:00.920 --> 06:02.524
I want to be with Wally.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.410
<i>This whole thing has made us realize</i>

06:09.560 --> 06:11.961
that we have no idea what's gonna happen,
you know, and--

06:12.120 --> 06:15.841
And if we're gonna go through something,
we want to go through it together.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.526
Yeah.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.646
This guy?

06:20.800 --> 06:21.847
You like him?

06:23.160 --> 06:24.321
Yeah.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.811
He makes you happy?

06:26.680 --> 06:27.920
Dad.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.641
Okay.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.606
That's it?

06:34.320 --> 06:35.810
You're not gonna yell?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.643
You're not gonna throw that over there?

06:38.800 --> 06:41.041
Your happiness is what matters to me.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.243
You're both adults.
I respect your decision.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.650
Don't screw it up.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.805
Okay, that was weird.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.004
I guess that this means
that we've got to find you a place.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.329
Me? More like us.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.530
You know, sometimes it seems

07:00.680 --> 07:02.842
like everybody else
gets to have their love donut.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.766
- Where's my love donut?
-(GROANS) Love is complicated.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.730
Hmm. So, uh, where's Julian?

07:09.960 --> 07:12.440
He's taking care
of some family matters in London.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.967
Just so you know, we are just friends.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.248
Yeah, the friend zone. I know it well.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.004
Pretty sure
I have a permanent residence there.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.766
You know,
maybe I should just swallow the pill.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.691
Maybe my game just ain't strong.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.684
Your game is so strong.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.045
For what it's worth,
I think Lisa Snart was totally into you.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.441
Lisa Snart.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.444
Not that I would actually
let you date her.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.443
Cisco, I promise, there is
a beautiful, intelligent woman out there

07:38.640 --> 07:41.962
who's gonna challenge you
to be your best version of yourself.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.123
In fact,
she could be right around the corner.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.447
Gypsy-

07:46.680 --> 07:47.841
(GRUNTING)

07:58.080 --> 07:59.764
(GRUNTING)

08:09.920 --> 08:11.251
(GRUNTING)

08:15.760 --> 08:17.046
Who the hell is this?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.160
(SIGHS)

08:25.160 --> 08:26.446
Where am I?

08:26.720 --> 08:28.131
H.R.I Oh! (CHUCKLES)

08:29.600 --> 08:30.840
Why am I locked up?

08:34.400 --> 08:35.525
H.R.: Oops.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.283
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
My powers don't work in here.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.966
Yeah, it's kind of the point of the cell.
What happened?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.725
I thought we were all on the same page.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.606
I spared your life, and you said
you'd go back to Earth-19

08:45.760 --> 08:47.125
and tell everyone you killed H.R.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.850
That's exactly what I did.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.760
- I told the council you were dead.
-I don't believe you.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.649
I didn't come here to take you back.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.121
- I'm telling you.
-Then why are you here?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.406
I don't know.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.970
The last thing I remember,
I was on Earth-2,

09:03.720 --> 09:04.846
hunting down another breacher.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.446
Wait. You were just on Earth-Z? Where?

09:08.080 --> 09:09.445
In the African jungle,

09:09.880 --> 09:12.326
-where I saw--
-Let me guess. A gorilla?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.602
Super tall? Anger management issues?

09:14.960 --> 09:17.725
Grodd must have taken control of her
and sent her here to kill us.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.485
<i>CISCO: Yeah, but she's on
a different Earth than him,</i>

09:19.640 --> 09:22.246
and Grodd's telepathy
can't cross dimensions like that.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.290
Grodd said he always thinks ahead,
just like the Reverse-Flash.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.647
He didn't have you to open a breach,
so he used Gypsy instead.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.963
So that means Grodd's here.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.324
Something tells me he's not alone.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.485
(SNARLING)

10:03.480 --> 10:04.845
(ARMY GROWLING)

10:10.560 --> 10:13.564
- Any sign of him yet?
-Not since you asked 30 seconds ago.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.245
Okay, he's a giant gorilla,

10:15.400 --> 10:17.402
who's probably leading
an army of giant gorillas.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.721
How can you not find him?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.644
He's probably figured out a way
to scramble our satellites.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.689
We're talking
about a genius super-ape here.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.969
And a master strategist
who successfully fooled us on my Earth.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.601
Yeah, we Wellses, we don't fool easy,
do we, Hard Hat?

10:28.760 --> 10:30.046
Don't call me "Hard Hat."

10:30.280 --> 10:32.362
We have to find him
before he hurts somebody else.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.201
Don't worry, Barry. We will.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.561
Every time I think we've beat him,

10:35.720 --> 10:38.041
he comes back stronger, smarter,
and more dangerous.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.411
He's evolving.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.204
I keep trying to fight him the same way.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.086
Okay, guys, look, we just have to come up
with a different way to beat him.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.003
What we need to do
is get ahead of him for once.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.685
We can. You've seen the future.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.967
<i>You know there's an attack.</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:54.690
If we just figure out
where that attack happens,

10:54.880 --> 10:56.928
we can launch a preemptive strike
against Grodd.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.048
We can stop the attack
before it ever starts.

10:59.640 --> 11:03.281
And fortunately, we have someone
who can foresee future events.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.491
- Before they happen.
-Okay, okay, there's only one problem.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.045
I can only vibe what Barry saw,

11:08.200 --> 11:11.010
and a ticker on the side of a bus stop
doesn't give us a whole lot of info.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.604
What if we widen the scope of your vibe?
Then you can see more of the future.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.730
Yes, I can do that.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.082
- I just need to borrow your vibe gear.
-Harry, that's my only pair.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.691
- I'll be careful.
-it's my only pair.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.286
West, come with me,
you have an engineer's mind.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.602
Yeah, sure. Happy to help.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.044
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.163
Can you talk to Joe,
see if he can rally CCPD?

11:30.320 --> 11:32.766
Yeah. Yeah, I'll let him know
that an army of sentient gorillas

11:32.960 --> 11:34.769
is about to storm the city.
He's gonna love that.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.007
Yeah.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.481
What about Gypsy?
She's a really powerful meta.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.722
Yeah, but how do we know
she's not a Grodd sleeper agent?

11:40.960 --> 11:42.041
She's not. I checked her out.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.329
- Can you convince her to help?
-Bruh, she won't say no to me.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.961
No way.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.971
You've got three speedsters, an ice queen,

11:50.120 --> 11:52.441
and a guy who vibes
almost as well as I do.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.250
You don't need my help to stop Grodd.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.131
Need I remind you, you're the one
who brought Grodd here in the first place.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.367
Not by choice.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.801
I was chasing a fugitive
from my world on Earth-2

12:00.960 --> 12:04.203
when Grodd ambushed me
and turned me into his damn puppet.

12:04.360 --> 12:08.081
Okay, so then this is the perfect
opportunity for payback, right?

12:09.480 --> 12:11.084
Don't tell me you're gonna run away
from this.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.406
- Ineverrun.
-Then stand and fight with us.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.321
We need you.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.321
You need me?

12:22.160 --> 12:23.924
Are you trying to Luke Starkiller me?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.520
(CHUCKLES)

12:28.480 --> 12:29.845
What if I am?

12:30.760 --> 12:32.410
Is that what it's gonna take
to get you to stay?

12:33.960 --> 12:36.850
Here's a bonus, you get to spend
extra time with this face.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.006
And look at this face. Come on.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.961
Who doesn't want to get to spend
extra time with this guy?

12:46.440 --> 12:47.521
What?

12:48.560 --> 12:52.007
The things I saw,
when Grodd was in control of my mind,

12:52.160 --> 12:55.209
the horrors in that monster's head,
I can never un-see them.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.163
- What horrors?
-The city in ruins,

12:59.720 --> 13:02.291
<i>people in pain, death everywhere.</i>

13:02.880 --> 13:05.531
That's what Grodd wants,
what he's planning.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.046
I'm sorry, Cisco. This is your fight,

13:10.560 --> 13:11.721
not mine.

13:15.800 --> 13:19.043
Now, if you don't mind,
I still have a fugitive to catch, so...

13:22.200 --> 13:23.201
Okay.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.006
I understand.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.010
Take care of yourself, Cisco.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.287
Admit it. You are so into me.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.726
West.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.964
How are we coming along with that gear?

14:00.200 --> 14:01.929
I've made all the adjustments
you asked for,

14:02.080 --> 14:03.764
so we should be good to go.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.809
- Good. Thank you.
-Yeah.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.847
Great.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.925
Um, how exactly is this gonna help Cisco
vibe any differently?

14:12.120 --> 14:13.770
Uh, simple science.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.288
We just broaden
the overall harmonic resonance

14:16.440 --> 14:17.965
of Cisco's vibrational frequencies

14:18.120 --> 14:20.885
all while focusing them
on a fixed temporal locus.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.764
- Couldn't be easier.
-Yeah.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.725
You know, I've got to admit, Harry, I was
super surprised at how cool you were

14:27.880 --> 14:29.120
with Jesse staying on this Earth.

14:29.280 --> 14:34.730
I thought, for sure, you were gonna freak
out and throw something or throw someone.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.323
Well, my daughter's happiness
is of the utmost importance to me,

14:40.040 --> 14:41.246
and you make her happy.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.807
I'm gonna do everything in my power
to keep it that way.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.610
I appreciate that, West.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.964
I'm sure Jesse will too after I'm gone.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.648
We're gonna come visit you
on Earth-2 a bunch,

14:52.800 --> 14:54.882
so you don't have to worry
about that, Harry.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.210
Yeah, right.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.647
Well, means the world to me,

14:59.880 --> 15:02.531
seeing as I don't know
how much time I have left.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.691
Wait. You're sick?

15:05.120 --> 15:07.691
I'm not as well as I once was.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.684
- Have you seen a doctor?
-Yes.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.723
I have seen a doctor, West.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.604
Is it serious?

15:17.840 --> 15:19.001
(EXHALES)

15:20.840 --> 15:22.205
Oh, man, Harry.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.001
Man. Um...

15:26.400 --> 15:28.209
- I'm sorry.
-Me, too.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.085
Does Jesse know?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.601
Appreciate it if you keep this between us.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.206
She doesn't know,
and we wouldn't want to upset her.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.051
Hey, SWAT's ready to roll
whenever y'all are.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.366
<i>- We find Grodd yet?
-(SIGHS)</i> We're about <i>to.</i>

15:46.960 --> 15:48.200
Cisco, you ready?

15:48.560 --> 15:51.404
- Harry, this thing, if it fries my brain--
-"it's an improvement."

15:51.720 --> 15:53.848
- Was that <i>Rocky?</i>
- Yeah, Burgess Meredith.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.361
(LAUGHS) Yeah, I'm ready.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.763
Word of warning. Vibing blind,
it's like surfing a monster wave.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.524
You need to stay above the temporal flow.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.921
Otherwise, your consciousness
can get sucked under.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.561
- And then what happens?
-I don't know. Guess we'll find out.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.609
-(MACHINE POWERING UP)
-Wait. What?

16:18.080 --> 16:19.844
<i>HARRISON: Where are you, Ramon?
What do you see?</i>

16:23.960 --> 16:26.611
<i>CISCO: I'm at an intersection.
State and Oakhill.</i>

16:27.720 --> 16:29.245
I think this is where it goes down.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.250
That's a block away from the bridge.

16:33.400 --> 16:37.086
That leads right to the heart of town.
If those gorillas get over that bridge--

16:37.240 --> 16:39.925
- They'll overrun the city in no time.
-Not if we stop them first.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.889
Eyes wide, everybody.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.607
Grodd's army could be here any second,
all right?

16:47.920 --> 16:50.446
- There's no sign of them.
-You sure this is the right place?

16:50.680 --> 16:53.604
- According to Cisco, this is it.
-Was it the right time?

16:54.840 --> 16:56.205
We're too early.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.611
No, Flash.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.807
Too late.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.965
- Grodd.
-I remember,

17:07.200 --> 17:08.964
this human is important to you.

17:09.760 --> 17:15.449
- Now, he's all mine.
-No! Hey, do not hurt him.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.843
- I'm the one you want, right?
-I warned you, Flash.

17:19.160 --> 17:23.926
And now, I'm here on First Earth
to make good on my promise.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.891
And when I'm finished,

17:26.079 --> 17:31.120
this city and all the puny humans
will die.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.044
(ECHOING) No!

17:40.360 --> 17:42.522
-(BULLET CLATTERS)
-Joe!

17:44.280 --> 17:46.487
- Are you okay?
-I think so.

17:47.920 --> 17:52.005
I don't get it. How is attacking
Detective Joe West a part of Grodd's plan?

17:52.160 --> 17:54.208
- It wasn't.
-Then what was it?

17:54.960 --> 17:56.086
A distraction.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.001
GENERAL: <i>I don't care if Senator Ford
is having doubts.</i>

18:05.160 --> 18:07.925
If the secretary doesn't approve
that budget first thing in the morning,

18:08.080 --> 18:09.844
we're gonna have to make
some serious cuts--

18:11.520 --> 18:12.760
(GRUNTS)

18:13.000 --> 18:14.206
(GROANING)

18:15.640 --> 18:16.766
The hell was that?

18:21.520 --> 18:22.851
(ROARING)

18:25.360 --> 18:26.407
(SNARLS)

18:35.000 --> 18:36.604
That damn gorilla almost got me this time.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.046
Shouldn't even have a scar.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.041
Do you remember anything
from when Grodd was controlling you?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.407
Not really. There's just some flashes.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.841
Flashes of what?

18:45.120 --> 18:48.966
They were, like, these images,
places I've never seen before.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.044
It was like I was seeing
what he was seeing.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.409
Gypsy said the same thing.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.087
Uh-oh.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.849
Here we go. I know that look.
That's the "I have a genius idea" look.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.841
A couple years back on my Earth, there was
a neuroscientist that was able to achieve

19:04.120 --> 19:08.091
memory recovery using transcranial
magnetic simulators on brain-damaged--

19:08.240 --> 19:10.971
We use that here
but more as a depression treatment.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.930
Well, in this experiment,
the neuroscientist focused all the energy

19:14.080 --> 19:16.321
on the occipital cortex of the patients,

19:16.480 --> 19:19.882
allowing them to achieve
almost full memory recollection.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.088
So you think the connection Grodd creates

19:22.240 --> 19:24.925
in the brains
of those he mind-controls goes

19:25.720 --> 19:27.563
-both ways?
-Could be.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.526
Maybe we could use Grodd's memories
that he left behind in Joe

19:30.680 --> 19:32.250
to figure out what his plan is.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.761
We'd just make some TCM simulators.
All it takes is some--

19:34.920 --> 19:36.251
- Magnets.
-Throw together some magnets,

19:36.440 --> 19:37.851
-make a helmet out of them.
-JOE: Hold on.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.446
Y'all want to put a bunch of magnets
against my skull

19:40.600 --> 19:43.922
to look into the mind
of a psychotic, murderous ape?

19:44.760 --> 19:47.127
- Yeah.
-Fine.

19:48.280 --> 19:51.409
Let's make it happen,
before Grodd tries to kill somebody else.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.807
CAITLIN: (SOFTLY) It's gonna be okay.

20:02.840 --> 20:03.966
Hey-

20:04.640 --> 20:06.290
ls everything okay?

20:07.280 --> 20:10.966
Just tired of seeing the people
I care about be put in harm's way.

20:11.280 --> 20:15.444
Yeah, but like always, we're gonna work
together and come up with a plan.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.724
We're gonna stop Grodd, Barry.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.365
And then what?

20:24.760 --> 20:26.046
We just send him back?

20:28.840 --> 20:30.444
He's just gonna come here again.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.722
We have to end this once and for all.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.091
Wait.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.121
What? You want to kill Grodd?

20:42.280 --> 20:43.327
Why not?

20:43.520 --> 20:46.649
That's how their society in Gorilla City
works, kill or be killed.

20:46.840 --> 20:50.606
That's why he wanted me to kill Solovar.
And you know what? I should have.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.685
I showed too much mercy.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.606
No, you did what was right, Barry,
as you always do.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.524
That's what makes you a hero.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.844
Oliver has killed.
He's still considered a hero.

21:01.400 --> 21:05.371
Yeah, and he lives with the weight
of that decision every single day.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.611
I think that,

21:07.840 --> 21:09.968
sometimes, the only way to stop
bad things from happening

21:10.160 --> 21:11.969
is to just get rid of what's causing them.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.210
What is this really about?

21:15.520 --> 21:17.249
Grodd or what happens to me?

21:17.920 --> 21:20.446
I kill Grodd, his attack never happens,

21:20.600 --> 21:25.288
that changes the future,
and you live, yeah.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.160
(SIGHS)

21:30.360 --> 21:33.887
Your humanity, showing mercy,

21:34.040 --> 21:36.611
that is what separates you
from everyone else.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.887
That's the reason
that everyone looks up to you.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.490
Don't compromise who you are, ever.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.363
Losing what makes the Flash "the Flash,"

21:47.840 --> 21:51.242
my life isn't worth it
if that's the cost to save me.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.571
Here you are.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.651
Hey, you know your dad's
gonna be all right.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.686
What's wrong?

22:10.200 --> 22:12.009
Look, I've been thinking, and I...

22:12.280 --> 22:15.921
I don't think you should stay here.
I think it was a bad idea.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.681
- Wally, you asked me.
-Yeah, and I shouldn't have.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.930
I think you should go back to Earth-2.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.241
Spend as much time with your dad
as you can.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.931
Spend as much time with my dad as I can?

22:34.120 --> 22:37.602
- Wally, what are you talking about?
-Your dad is sick, Jesse.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.240
He's really sick.
He doesn't have much time left.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.731
- Did he tell you that?
-I'm so sorry.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.048
He is unbelievable.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.320
So all you have to do is concentrate
on your memories of Grodd, okay?

22:56.520 --> 22:58.363
Yeah, that won't be a problem.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.321
All right.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.245
- Hey, dead man. Seriously?
-Hmm?

23:05.480 --> 23:06.811
You told Wally you were dying?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.166
- Dying?
-You're dying?

23:09.440 --> 23:13.650
I didn't say I was... I said I didn't know
how much time I had left.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.609
- None of us--
-What is wrong with you?

23:17.600 --> 23:20.524
Is there seriously nothing you won't say
to get me to stay by your side?

23:20.960 --> 23:21.961
- I <i>don't--
- Look, whatever.</i>

23:22.120 --> 23:24.088
I'm moving here,
whether you like it or not.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.166
(SIGHS)

23:28.080 --> 23:29.081
So all you have to do is concentrate

23:29.240 --> 23:30.526
-on your memories of Grodd.
-Yeah.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.808
- You ready?
-Waiting on you, dead man.

23:33.480 --> 23:38.247
Hey, if I start to Grodd-out at any point,
cut the power off immediately.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.880
- Of course.
-All right, Joe, you ready?

23:41.560 --> 23:43.324

before I lose my job.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.046
Okay.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.883
You sure you still don't want to look
into the future and see what's changed?

38:12.720 --> 38:15.007
No. Think I'm done with that.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.361
Good.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.445
- I'll see you at home.
-Okay.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.207
I'll walk out with you.
I've got a date with Cecile.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.401
Ooh!

38:24.800 --> 38:26.450
Come on, guys. Let's go find Harry.

38:31.120 --> 38:33.088
To review, this is my daughter.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.768
There's nothing more important to me,

38:36.240 --> 38:37.446
so you do right by my daughter,

38:37.600 --> 38:40.888
or there is nowhere in the multi-verse
I won't find you.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.327
- Dad.
-They'd have to kill me.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.168
Bye. (CHUCKLES)

38:56.640 --> 38:58.768
- Bye.
-Bye, Jesse Quick.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.171
Always another way, Flash. Always.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.200
<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

39:25.520 --> 39:26.646
Babe?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.048
Is that Grandma Esther's noodles?

39:30.200 --> 39:31.201
<i>BARRY". Mmm-hmm.</i>

39:31.400 --> 39:34.051
And there's mint chocolate chip
in the freezer.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.281
- And these are for you.
-(CHUCKLES)

39:41.760 --> 39:43.171
What is all this?

39:44.960 --> 39:49.807
I've been really busy recently
with trying to avoid the future,

39:50.800 --> 39:53.849
and I forgot that
there's always another way.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.646
What is that?

40:00.000 --> 40:04.005
Making the future our future.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.321
(EXHALES)

40:11.120 --> 40:14.329
My great-grandfather gave this to
my great-grandmother after World War ll.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.609
He wanted to propose
before he was shipped out,

40:16.760 --> 40:18.569
but he didn't have the money.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.485
And he bought this three years later
when he was stationed in London.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.002
Fought his way across France,
all the way to Berlin,

40:24.480 --> 40:27.529
and this ring around his neck
with his dog tags.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.524
And when he got back,
she was waiting for him

40:29.680 --> 40:31.648
on the dock of the Brooklyn Navy Yards.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.170
He proposed on the spot.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.683
After my mom passed away,

40:40.040 --> 40:42.850
Joe held on to this for me until tonight.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.481
Barry.

40:45.680 --> 40:49.048
Iris West, will you marry me?

40:50.840 --> 40:52.001
(SOBS)

40:56.520 --> 40:58.329
MAN: <i>(ON</i> TV) <i>Ilsa,
we both know you belong with Victor.</i>

40:58.800 --> 41:00.723
<i>You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.</i>

41:01.360 --> 41:04.204
<i>- If that plane leaves...
-JESSE: Okay, I'm so confused.</i>

41:04.760 --> 41:06.967
Is it supposed to be about
the War of the Americas?

41:07.720 --> 41:09.609
Do you not like it?
'Cause this is my favorite movie.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.808
No, I didn't say that.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.246
Um...

41:13.520 --> 41:15.727
I guess we just have more wars
on my Earth.

41:16.680 --> 41:19.411
Well, we can just watch something else.

41:22.720 --> 41:26.441
Or we don't have to watch anything at all.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.207
You know what I could go for?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.210
(WHISPERS) Big Belly Burger.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.209
- Wow. Wow.
-(CHUCKLES)

41:40.360 --> 41:41.646
- Ow. Um...
-(CHUCKLES)

41:41.920 --> 41:44.526
- I'll be right back.
-Thank you.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.086
