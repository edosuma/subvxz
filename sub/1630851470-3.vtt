WEBVTT

00:20.250 --> 00:23.083
Uh, okay, okay.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.666
So this goes there. Where'd I put that?

00:25.708 --> 00:27.083
Right, okay.

00:27.125 --> 00:29.791
Um, tighten this a little bit and, um, okay,

00:29.833 --> 00:32.291
uh, engine's just about ready.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.750
Kinda helped that we aren't getting shot at anymore.

00:34.791 --> 00:36.000
And for that, we have

00:36.041 --> 00:38.375
our new traveling companion to thank.

00:39.833 --> 00:42.958
Is Uncle "Convenient" there gonna to ride with us?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.958
I'm happy  to hear we aren't the only ones

00:45.000 --> 00:46.583
that think Keldor's suspicious.

00:46.625 --> 00:49.333
Keldor's weapon does bear  the same crest

00:49.375 --> 00:51.166
as Adam's sword, does it not?

00:51.208 --> 00:53.875
Evelyn had me track down a lot of Grayskull artifacts.

00:53.916 --> 00:57.833
Not a single one had whatever that green stuff is.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.625
Well, Adam is clever.

01:00.666 --> 01:05.000
If something is amiss, I'm sure he'll feel it.

01:05.041 --> 01:09.000
Why isn't Keldor just wiping the floor with them and taking the sword?

01:09.041 --> 01:10.791
He doesn't want  to scare the boy

01:10.833 --> 01:14.083
into transforming into his muscle-bound alter ego

01:14.125 --> 01:16.958
before Keldor can get his hands on the sword.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.666
And we think we can trust him once he does?

01:20.708 --> 01:23.500
If we can't,  then we'll simply pry it

01:23.541 --> 01:26.875
from his cold, dead, bony hand.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.541
Apologies, nephew,

01:30.583 --> 01:34.458
this is a reunion that is  long overdue.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.916
Not to be ungrateful,

01:35.958 --> 01:38.000
but where have you been?

01:38.041 --> 01:39.958
Why hasn't anyone come looking  for me?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.500
You don't remember  what happened?

01:42.541 --> 01:44.958
I don't remember anything before the jungle.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.458
Nothing about you. Nothing about myself, even.

01:50.291 --> 01:53.208
Adam, my brother,

01:53.250 --> 01:55.125
your father,

01:55.166 --> 01:58.625
he's the King of all Eternos.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.666
Me, a Prince?

02:04.708 --> 02:06.041
Trotting around in what?

02:06.083 --> 02:07.958
White tights  with a silly haircut?

02:10.958 --> 02:12.250
You're being serious.

02:12.291 --> 02:14.375
This is good news, boy.

02:14.416 --> 02:16.791
You're a prince, as am I.

02:16.833 --> 02:19.250
We're sons of the House  of Randor.

02:19.291 --> 02:21.333
The Heirs of Grayskull.

02:21.375 --> 02:25.708
It is a responsibility you were literally born to handle.

02:25.750 --> 02:27.708
Is that why the sword woke up

02:27.750 --> 02:29.833
when I held it the first time?

02:29.875 --> 02:31.958
Grayskull's secrets  have been entrusted

02:32.000 --> 02:34.666
to the royal bloodline  for a millennium.

02:34.708 --> 02:37.041
We are meant to use its power

02:37.083 --> 02:40.416
to rule this land as we see fit.

02:41.958 --> 02:44.041
I don't--I don't want to rule.

02:44.083 --> 02:45.583
And why would you?

02:45.625 --> 02:49.958
No child need bear the burden of this power alone.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.916
There's not much burden anymore.

02:51.958 --> 02:54.541
It ran out of juice the first time I used it.

02:55.750 --> 02:59.166
So you can't change then?

03:00.291 --> 03:01.916
How did you know I can change?

03:01.958 --> 03:05.541
The pair of sociopaths with the rocket launcher  told me.

03:07.375 --> 03:08.583
Uncle?

03:10.625 --> 03:12.750
-Adam! -Called it.

03:12.791 --> 03:14.166
Adam!

03:14.208 --> 03:16.083
I'm gonna go get the med pack.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.666
You may explode them now.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.458
Oops!

03:38.375 --> 03:41.208
Onward to Grayskull.

03:42.833 --> 03:45.458
I have the Power!

04:27.791 --> 04:29.583
Adam?

04:31.958 --> 04:33.833
Adam, wake up.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.250
Teela?

04:35.291 --> 04:36.666
Did we make it out?

04:36.708 --> 04:38.666
Not quite.

04:38.708 --> 04:41.375
Oh, man. How much rock is that?

04:41.416 --> 04:43.416
I don't know. All of it?

04:43.458 --> 04:45.250
All of the rocks ever?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.708
Magic has its limits, and I'm about to hit mine.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.208
We need a way out, fast!

04:57.250 --> 05:00.833
Krass? Cringer?

05:00.875 --> 05:02.666
It's just me in here.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.625
Krass, are you okay?

05:08.666 --> 05:11.875
I was wearing my helmet, so of course I'm okay.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.000
You know what I mean.

05:15.791 --> 05:17.375
Sure, I'm great.

05:17.416 --> 05:19.208
There's plenty of room in here

05:19.250 --> 05:23.166
under tons  of rock with air running out.

05:23.208 --> 05:24.625
Hey, easy.

05:24.666 --> 05:27.333
We've got plenty  of air down here, right, Teela?

05:27.375 --> 05:28.791
Not unless you grabbed extra

05:28.833 --> 05:30.791
while your uncle was burying us  alive.

05:30.833 --> 05:32.625
What did--what'd she say?

05:39.916 --> 05:42.250
Krass, I'm thinking maybe we're on our way into you.

05:43.541 --> 05:45.458
Then we'll figure a way out together.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.458
I promise.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.958
You better hurry.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.750
These rocks aren't gonna stay floating on their own.

05:50.791 --> 05:51.958
I'll get us in.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.375
Just hold on a little  bit longer.

05:53.416 --> 05:56.041
Easy for you to say.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.666
From the sounds of things, we don't have much time.

06:01.708 --> 06:04.500
Please tell me you have a way to get us down to them.

06:04.541 --> 06:07.041
Without any anti-grav  or an earth mover?

06:07.083 --> 06:10.083
Why don't you have any anti-grav or earth mover?

06:10.125 --> 06:14.083
Uh, because they wouldn't fit in my backpack?

06:14.125 --> 06:15.958
What's a backpack?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.666
Right, talking tiger.

06:19.708 --> 06:22.500
Um, don't worry about it.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.500
All right, I know we had it in here somewhere.

06:26.541 --> 06:28.791
Where is it? Aha!

06:28.833 --> 06:31.458
I might be able to make do  with this.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.708
If we can restart  the ship remotely,

06:33.750 --> 06:36.041
the force of the blast should clear the rocks away.

06:36.083 --> 06:39.458
I just need a space big enough  to be able  to bounce the signal down.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.416
Oh, boy.

06:43.458 --> 06:44.875
You're a big, strong tiger.

06:44.916 --> 06:46.416
How do you feel about digging?

06:46.458 --> 06:48.791
Easier said than done.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.083
I can work with that too.

07:01.541 --> 07:03.833
I'm gonna have to find a new apprentice, you know.

07:03.875 --> 07:06.583
Fortunately for you, the vocational orphanages

07:06.625 --> 07:08.416
have no shortage of strays.

07:08.458 --> 07:09.875
I'm gone for a decade,

07:09.916 --> 07:12.875
and here the two of you are, planning a family.

07:12.916 --> 07:15.958
I fully expected you to have turned on each other by now.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.750
Prince Keldor,  why not fly ahead of us

07:18.791 --> 07:20.041
since you know the way?

07:20.083 --> 07:22.625
Because... I don't trust you.

07:22.666 --> 07:24.500
We don't trust you that much,  either.

07:24.541 --> 07:26.083
Good.

07:26.125 --> 07:29.041
At least you're smarter than you were ten years ago.

07:31.708 --> 07:35.000
Change course,  we're nearly there.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.333
Adam?

07:52.375 --> 07:54.416
Yeah, Krass?

07:54.458 --> 07:57.458
Please tell me this isn't just like when I crashed.

07:59.666 --> 08:03.666
Because this feels just like when I crashed.

08:04.916 --> 08:07.041
Just stay calm.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.958
What crash?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.541
The one where  she lost her parents.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.333
It took the tribe three days

08:15.375 --> 08:17.250
to free her from the wreckage.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.875
How did she survive?

08:18.916 --> 08:20.875
She was wearing her  dad's helmet.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.083
Remarkable.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.625
Best I could do on short notice.

08:31.666 --> 08:33.583
I can only imagine

08:33.625 --> 08:35.791
what wonders you might be able  to forge,

08:35.833 --> 08:39.541
had you the time...

08:39.583 --> 08:41.458
and resources.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.041
Well,  Kronis didn't let me

08:43.083 --> 08:44.375
too far off the leash,

08:44.416 --> 08:45.875
so your guess is as good  as mine.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.666
Wait, wait a minute.  Was that offensive?

08:48.708 --> 08:49.958
The leash thing?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.375
That was probably offe--I  offended you.

08:52.416 --> 08:55.458
Okay, after I just gave you back your claws.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.333
Hey, I'm a nice guy, right?

08:58.375 --> 09:00.375
Friend, if I wanted to eat you,

09:00.416 --> 09:03.458
I wouldn't need my claws  to do so.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.041
Whoa!

09:05.083 --> 09:06.500
Aah!

09:10.208 --> 09:11.666
Is this enough of an air pocket

09:11.708 --> 09:14.291
to bounce your signal down  to the ship?

09:14.333 --> 09:16.416
Should be just enough.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.458
All right, let's get some cover.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.833
Once those jets go off,

09:19.875 --> 09:22.000
we don't want  to be anywhere near them.

09:22.041 --> 09:25.916
You may want to consider warning our allies first.

09:25.958 --> 09:27.875
Oh, right, sorry.

09:27.916 --> 09:29.833
This is my first rescue.

09:38.791 --> 09:41.250
Prince Keldor,

09:41.291 --> 09:43.541
it's magnificent.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.916
Kronis, don't you agree?

09:45.958 --> 09:47.875
Roomier than I thought.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.791
Patience, Kronis.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.375
The castle's blasted Guardian

09:58.416 --> 10:01.625
swore I'd never be able  to find it again.

10:06.666 --> 10:08.750
This proves the joke's on her.

10:54.291 --> 10:58.375
Honey, I'm home!

10:59.708 --> 11:02.666
Adam, do something!

11:02.708 --> 11:04.166
I'm trying!

11:12.291 --> 11:14.541
Krass, I can hold this rock

11:14.583 --> 11:16.541
for maybe another few seconds,

11:16.583 --> 11:19.583
but I can't move forward without dropping it.

11:19.625 --> 11:21.916
Then how am I supposed to get the door open?

11:21.958 --> 11:23.291
Ram it!

11:23.333 --> 11:25.708
Hey, guys,  this is Duncan.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.083
Um, I'm turning  on the engines now,

11:28.125 --> 11:29.708
so please make sure you're  inside the ship

11:29.750 --> 11:31.541
so you don't explode along  with the rocks.

11:31.583 --> 11:35.458
Not now now,  but in a few seconds.

11:38.916 --> 11:41.583
Okay,  I hope you're in position.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.541
Three...

11:45.583 --> 11:48.083
Two...

11:48.125 --> 11:49.166
One.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.916
Turn it off.

12:07.458 --> 12:08.666
Turn it off!

12:23.166 --> 12:25.166
--We did it!

12:27.750 --> 12:29.375
-Yay. -Yay.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.416
-Yay. -

12:36.333 --> 12:38.458
Duncan, how far until Grayskull?

12:38.500 --> 12:42.041
Assuming your uncle parked  those sky sleds I've been tracking out front,

12:42.083 --> 12:44.458
we're pretty close.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.166
What did Evelyn want  to do with the sword?

12:47.208 --> 12:49.166
Get revenge on King Randor.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.041
What did your uncle want to do with it?

12:51.083 --> 12:53.500
I think he wants to become king,

12:53.541 --> 12:55.291
and seeing as how he just buried

12:55.333 --> 12:57.875
a bunch of kids alive, I don't think he'll make  a very good one.

12:57.916 --> 12:59.125
We need to hurry.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.333
Everybody--even you, Witchy,

13:02.375 --> 13:04.875
I'm so sorry I couldn't "ram up"

13:04.916 --> 13:06.750
and get us out of there sooner.

13:06.791 --> 13:08.250
Hey, I'm the one that messed up

13:08.291 --> 13:09.791
and let Keldor get the sword.

13:09.833 --> 13:12.500
I knocked the rocket off course and got us buried.

13:12.541 --> 13:16.083
My boss fired that rocket, so...

13:16.125 --> 13:21.458
When it mattered, I believe we all rammed up just fine.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.833
Castle Grayskull.

14:21.041 --> 14:23.958
When you dreamed  about this place,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.583
was it this intimidating?

14:25.625 --> 14:27.875
Absolutely.

14:38.125 --> 14:41.125
Behind this gate lies  great power.

14:41.166 --> 14:44.291
We must approach with caution.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.666
Adam!

14:45.708 --> 14:48.416
-Wait up. -Wait up.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.875
Whoa.

15:00.708 --> 15:03.500
Did we just come in or out?

15:18.125 --> 15:20.125
Should we split up?

15:24.541 --> 15:27.291
I guess they know we're coming now.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.416
If they're even still here.

15:29.458 --> 15:32.000
How do we know where they went once they came inside?

15:32.041 --> 15:35.416
I think we follow the trail of breadcrumbs they left behind.

16:09.916 --> 16:11.375
Who was she?

16:11.416 --> 16:13.833
The guardian of this place.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.708
The voice in your head?

16:30.291 --> 16:32.791
I think this was hers too.

16:36.041 --> 16:39.958
It would appear it belongs to you now, Teela.

16:46.791 --> 16:49.000
It wants us to go this way.

16:51.916 --> 16:54.125
Let's go find out why.

16:56.166 --> 16:59.500
They say that like talking weapons is a thing.

16:59.541 --> 17:01.541
It is now, I guess.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.416
What is this place?

17:15.833 --> 17:18.416
Well, if this was a ship,

17:18.458 --> 17:20.958
I'd say this was probably  the engine room.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.541
Wait. Wait, wait.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.916
We don't think this castle turns into a ship, do we?

17:39.875 --> 17:42.500
Space castle's haunted.

17:42.541 --> 17:45.291
Let me go!

17:45.333 --> 17:47.833
Shush.  The grown-ups are talking.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.875
Release the child.

17:50.916 --> 17:54.166
Release this castle's power  to me

17:54.208 --> 17:55.666
instead of my brother,

17:55.708 --> 17:59.125
and you have yourself a deal,  Sorceress.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.083
Not ghosts, Krass.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.166
Just echoes of the past.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.583
My past.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.333
Like a message in a bottle.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.250
Proper use  of the Power

18:12.291 --> 18:13.875
requires selection of a totem

18:13.916 --> 18:16.083
for mastery of one's true self.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.166
Choose wisely.

18:20.541 --> 18:23.250
The sword is the tool  of a soldier,

18:23.291 --> 18:26.333
one who fights at the behest  of others,

18:26.375 --> 18:29.500
a servant to the Power.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.958
The scepter, on the other hand,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.750
this is the totem  of a true ruler.

18:36.791 --> 18:38.333
Then seize the power

18:38.375 --> 18:40.916
you truly deserve,  Prince Keldor.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.208
Aah!

18:51.250 --> 18:54.875
What are you doing to me?

18:54.916 --> 18:56.458
You did this to yourself

18:56.500 --> 18:59.875
when you chose Havoc over Justice and Light.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.666
Bleh.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.791
Restore me or perish.

19:17.833 --> 19:19.416
The Power of Grayskull

19:19.458 --> 19:22.625
can only be commanded  by a true champion.

19:22.666 --> 19:24.791
So be it.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.083
Really? The kid?

19:33.125 --> 19:36.750
In what world is this boy  a champion?

19:36.791 --> 19:39.083
Leave her alone.

19:39.125 --> 19:42.416
Being a champion is about defending those...

19:42.458 --> 19:44.708
Who can't defend themselves.

19:46.875 --> 19:49.041
There's the sword.

19:55.041 --> 19:56.916
Here goes nothing.

19:56.958 --> 20:01.166
By the power of...  well, you, Castle.

20:22.250 --> 20:25.416
I have the Power!

20:37.416 --> 20:38.958
Sword wouldn't do that  for me

20:39.000 --> 20:40.458
when I tried using it.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.333
I wonder why.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.166
Is a better fighter not worthy?

20:48.750 --> 20:51.583
One who makes decisions without hesitation.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.541
A champion that isn't some child

20:54.583 --> 20:56.750
playing at being a man!

21:00.375 --> 21:01.916
Aah!

21:01.958 --> 21:04.333
Why are you doing this?

21:04.375 --> 21:06.541
I'm dying, nephew,

21:06.583 --> 21:08.000
little by little,

21:08.041 --> 21:11.625
afflicted with Havoc from one poor decision.

21:11.666 --> 21:13.875
I thought you wanted  to rule Eternos.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.208
I can't very well do that

21:19.250 --> 21:22.291
as a pile of cursed bones,  can I?

21:22.333 --> 21:24.625
--Aah!

21:24.666 --> 21:26.791
Let me make this simple

21:26.833 --> 21:29.083
for you, Champion.

21:29.125 --> 21:31.625
Remove augen brights.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.375
Reactivate this chamber...

21:40.083 --> 21:41.583
Or I'll turn them

21:41.625 --> 21:44.583
into monsters...

21:44.625 --> 21:46.291
like me.
