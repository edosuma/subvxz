WEBVTT

00:01.203 --> 00:02.829
You gotta take this class, bro.

00:02.829 --> 00:04.412
Gene's teachings
changed my life.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.912
Folks. Ryan Madison...

00:08.120 --> 00:10.787
is dead.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.286
We got two DBs in the BMW...

00:15.286 --> 00:17.245
They look Russian or Chechen...

00:17.245 --> 00:18.495
Freeze, calf-boy.

00:18.495 --> 00:19.995
You killed two of my men.

00:19.995 --> 00:23.161
One of them
was best Chechen assassin.

00:23.370 --> 00:24.870
-Well, he wasn't that great.
-Hey...

00:25.370 --> 00:27.412
This hit is urgent.

00:27.412 --> 00:29.036
I want you to do it, Barry.

00:29.036 --> 00:31.412
- Yes, or we kill him now.
- Barry...

00:31.662 --> 00:34.745
If you-- if you hurt him...
I'll come back here...

00:35.036 --> 00:36.912
and I'll kill
every single one of you.

00:38.495 --> 00:39.704
He cares about Fuches.

00:39.704 --> 00:41.662
That's just nice.

00:51.328 --> 00:54.995
We all act
in our everyday lives.

00:54.995 --> 00:59.161
The basketball player
acts angry to get the crowd
to their feet.

00:59.161 --> 01:03.161
The woman acts
as if she's had a climax
with the incompetent lover.

01:03.161 --> 01:06.328
We all act.
But what I want you to do

01:06.328 --> 01:09.370
is simply identify,
moment to moment,

01:09.370 --> 01:13.704
what you've been
doing subconsciously
your whole life.

01:13.704 --> 01:17.036
I remember once,
Patrick Swayze--
a true friend

01:17.036 --> 01:18.787
until we had a falling out...

01:18.787 --> 01:20.412
...and he had it written
into his will

01:20.412 --> 01:22.203
that I was barred
from his funeral--

01:26.704 --> 01:27.912
Yup?

01:27.912 --> 01:31.578
Hey, man.
Are you seeing
this beautiful morning?

01:37.495 --> 01:39.078
What are you doing?
How are you?

01:39.078 --> 01:40.370
What am I doing?

01:40.370 --> 01:43.120
I'm set up to kill Paco
like you asked me to.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.245
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

01:44.245 --> 01:47.662
Oh, right. Duh.
Umm, here's the thing.

01:47.662 --> 01:52.036
I need you to wait, Barry,
just a little bit longer
for my signal.

01:52.036 --> 01:55.620
Wait? For what? Wait--
What-- What signal? Why?

01:55.620 --> 01:58.704
Because we sent bullet
to the Bolivians.

01:58.704 --> 02:02.328
You sent a bullet
to the Bolivians?
What, like in the mail?

02:02.328 --> 02:04.578
DHL.
It's actually really cool.

02:04.578 --> 02:07.620
So, Paco is our informant
within the Bolivians.

02:07.620 --> 02:10.912
We tell him, "Trust us.
Tell us everything you know."

02:10.912 --> 02:12.912
He tell us,
because he is stupid,

02:12.912 --> 02:15.787
and now we have
to kill him before he tell
other people he tell us.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.578
Okay, what does
that have to do
with mailing a bullet?

02:17.578 --> 02:20.120
See, this way,
we send message
to the Bolivians,

02:20.120 --> 02:22.787
get inside their heads.
They open mail.

02:22.787 --> 02:24.412
Bullet. "What?"

02:24.412 --> 02:25.995
Phone rings. "Hello?

02:25.995 --> 02:28.120
- Paco's dead?
- What?"

02:28.120 --> 02:30.286
Little "what" leads
to big "what" for full effect.

02:30.286 --> 02:34.078
Hank, you can't do this
to me right now, all right?

02:34.078 --> 02:36.537
I'm fully exposed here.
I gotta do this now.

02:36.537 --> 02:38.286
All right?
I gotta do it right now.

02:38.286 --> 02:40.286
Well, when I get
DHL confirmation...

02:40.286 --> 02:43.912
...from www.DHL.com,

02:43.912 --> 02:46.120
all right,
that's when you kill Paco.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.453
Can you be a bro
for me please?

02:48.453 --> 02:51.870
Wait for high sign?
Hank, I got a clear shot
of Paco right now.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.954
I'm taking him.
I'm not waiting
for some fucking bullet.

02:53.954 --> 02:55.495
I'd rather
you did, though.

02:55.495 --> 02:57.495
Oh my God.

03:00.578 --> 03:03.286
I cannot
fucking believe you're doing
this to me, man. Fuck you!

03:03.286 --> 03:05.620
Fuck you and Pazar!
Fuck you guys!

03:05.620 --> 03:08.787
Mailing a bullet?
What fucking grade
am I in, man?

03:08.787 --> 03:11.495
You bald fuck.
Fuck you, man.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.620
Come on,
you don't mean that.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.370
Website says
it's out for delivery,

03:15.370 --> 03:19.620
so the bullet should
be arriving anytime
between now and midnight.

03:19.620 --> 03:22.286
Bolivian time.
So just wait.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.161
Because if you do not,

03:24.161 --> 03:25.829
we do have Fuches
here still with us,

03:25.829 --> 03:27.453
and I would hate
for something
to happen to him.

03:27.453 --> 03:30.704
I know you guys
are best friends.

03:30.704 --> 03:32.954
Barry? Hello?

03:32.954 --> 03:35.036
He must have bad reception.

03:35.036 --> 03:36.829
Did he ask how I was?

03:36.829 --> 03:39.787
No, but he did seem
weirdly frustrated.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.787
Yeah, I couldn't help
but overhear.

03:41.787 --> 03:43.078
You mailed a bullet?

03:43.078 --> 03:45.704
This Paco seems like
a good informant.

03:45.704 --> 03:47.161
Why kill him at all?

03:47.161 --> 03:50.370
Look. The whole...

03:50.370 --> 03:52.120
...mailing bullet concept

03:52.120 --> 03:54.870
is something Goran's
been work-shopping
for years now.

03:54.870 --> 03:57.537
Mmm.
And I just think
this time...

03:57.537 --> 04:00.036
we can really stick
the landing with Paco.

04:00.036 --> 04:02.537
Hank!

04:02.537 --> 04:05.120
Hank. Hank.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.453
I just get call from home.

04:07.453 --> 04:10.537
Okay.
They are sending
Lucky's replacement.

04:12.286 --> 04:15.286
They are sending... Stovka.

04:18.328 --> 04:21.495
What?
Oh my-- Stovka?

04:21.495 --> 04:22.787
He's coming here?

04:22.787 --> 04:24.662
Oh my God!
Who's Stovka?

04:24.662 --> 04:28.453
He is best assassin
in history of Chechnya!
Yes!

04:28.453 --> 04:30.203
Oh! Ow! Okay.
A legend!

04:30.203 --> 04:33.745
Oh! Right, right.
It's still tender,
but he is beyond legend.

04:33.745 --> 04:35.787
Okay? He has taken out
whole armies by himself.

04:35.787 --> 04:38.036
He must've murdered over--
what, hundreds?

04:38.036 --> 04:40.704
More. Way more.
He is unreal.

04:40.704 --> 04:43.620
- Simply unreal.
- Okay. When I was kid,

04:43.620 --> 04:45.829
I saw him
once walking out
of discotheque.

04:45.829 --> 04:48.912
He flicks cigarette at bird,
knocked it out of sky.

04:48.912 --> 04:51.829
When will he be here?
Within hour they said.

04:51.829 --> 04:55.412
Yeah, real quick.
What does this mean
for me and Barry?

04:56.745 --> 04:59.245
We'll cross that bridge...
We'll probably kill you.

04:59.245 --> 05:01.829
...when we get there.
But I haven't checked
with Goran yet.

05:09.161 --> 05:12.829
Now, the Spring Princess
gathers the fairy dust

05:12.829 --> 05:15.412
for the Rainbow Festival!

05:17.829 --> 05:19.412
Birthday girl.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.245
Let's count her turns.

05:22.245 --> 05:25.787
One, two,

05:25.787 --> 05:29.078
three, four...

05:29.078 --> 05:31.245
- Five, six...
- Hold on.

05:31.245 --> 05:33.954
Hello?
Sally, it's Mike.

05:33.954 --> 05:35.453
How's my favorite
almost-client?

05:35.453 --> 05:36.662
Good, good, I'm great.

05:36.662 --> 05:38.286
You got an audition
this afternoon.

05:38.286 --> 05:39.787
Uh, today?
Oh wow.

05:39.787 --> 05:43.620
Network. TV version
of the Matt Damon movie,
We Bought a Zoo,

05:43.620 --> 05:46.203
only instead of the dad,
it's a millennial girl.

05:46.203 --> 05:47.370
They asked
for you by name.

05:47.370 --> 05:48.954
They did?
For the lead?
...18...

05:48.954 --> 05:51.161
No, it's the role
of a mom,

05:51.161 --> 05:52.286
pivotal to the episode.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.203
Cool. So like
a millennial mom?

05:54.203 --> 05:55.495
I don't know.
I haven't read it.

05:55.495 --> 05:56.787
Can I tell them
you'll be there?

05:56.787 --> 05:58.245
Absolutely.
...24...

05:58.245 --> 06:00.578
Great.
...25...

06:00.578 --> 06:01.537
Sweetie!

06:01.537 --> 06:02.995
Rebecca! Rebecca!

06:02.995 --> 06:04.912
- Shit. Oh, sorry.
- Are you all right, honey?

06:04.912 --> 06:06.537
- Is she okay?
- Oh my God.

06:15.704 --> 06:17.787
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

06:20.203 --> 06:22.161
Oh, fuck you.

06:23.453 --> 06:26.203
This is
so fucking stupid.

06:43.787 --> 06:45.203
Nice.

06:45.203 --> 06:46.954
Nice. Great.

06:46.954 --> 06:48.912
All right.
That's enough.
That's enough.

06:48.912 --> 06:51.161
Come on, get out.
Go, go, go.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.203
Back to work. Go.

06:53.203 --> 06:55.662
This one's going
on the wall.

06:55.662 --> 07:00.203
Stovka.
Welcome to America.

07:00.203 --> 07:01.370
Ah.

07:14.870 --> 07:16.036
Pop!

07:20.412 --> 07:21.495
Pop!

07:23.245 --> 07:24.870
You want coffee,
something?

07:24.870 --> 07:26.203
Come inside.
No.

07:27.495 --> 07:29.412
I'd rather just sit here.

07:29.412 --> 07:31.954
Okay. Uh... Oh!

07:31.954 --> 07:34.120
This...

07:35.120 --> 07:36.995
was my father's.

07:36.995 --> 07:40.245
I know he would've
wanted you to have this.

07:49.412 --> 07:50.912
First time in LA?

07:50.912 --> 07:52.412
Yeah, I picked up on that,

07:52.412 --> 07:54.704
what you and the big guy
were talking about there.

07:54.704 --> 07:57.954
When my partner
gets back, you're gonna...

07:59.078 --> 08:01.370
kill us, yeah? Pop!

08:02.745 --> 08:03.787
You know,

08:03.787 --> 08:06.620
there's a version
of this where...

08:07.870 --> 08:09.745
you don't do that.

08:09.745 --> 08:12.245
My whole life...

08:12.245 --> 08:14.745
ever since a boy...

08:14.745 --> 08:17.120
is death.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.286
Well, you're a regular
Family Circus cartoon.

08:20.286 --> 08:24.662
Moss, Moss, Moss, Moss, Moss.
What, what, what, what, what?

08:24.662 --> 08:27.370
I just talked to the manager
of the gym...
What?

08:27.370 --> 08:28.870
...where Ryan Madison worked.
Uh-huh?

08:28.870 --> 08:31.453
And it turns out
that Romeo Madison

08:31.453 --> 08:35.328
was "training"
Goran Pazar's wife.

08:36.787 --> 08:38.537
"Training."
Oh shit.

08:38.537 --> 08:40.328
Like fucking her.
Fucking.
Motive.

08:40.328 --> 08:44.036
So, we know
why the Chechens
would kill Ryan.

08:44.036 --> 08:45.954
But who killed
the Chechens?

08:45.954 --> 08:49.537
You know, I feel
like the unknown shooter's
probably defending Ryan, right?

08:49.537 --> 08:52.620
Well, he's probably
someone from the gym
or the acting class,

08:52.620 --> 08:57.161
'cause Ryan didn't have
much life outside of these
two places, right?

08:57.161 --> 09:00.662
All right, guys.
Hopefully, you've been working
on your private spaces.

09:00.662 --> 09:01.912
Nick, you're up.

09:01.912 --> 09:04.370
Why don't you come up
and amaze us all?

09:04.370 --> 09:05.453
Okay.

09:05.453 --> 09:07.537
Let's see your space.

09:11.912 --> 09:14.829
Wow.
I'm in my childhood bedroom.

09:14.829 --> 09:18.203
Oh, look, here's the ball
from the championship game.

09:19.495 --> 09:20.495
Oh!

09:21.662 --> 09:23.954
Oh, my play chest.

09:29.203 --> 09:30.704
Whoa.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.286
What are
my sister's dolls
doing in here?

09:33.286 --> 09:35.412
I think that's enough.
Thank you.

09:35.412 --> 09:38.578
I'm in my friend's zoo
with my 14-year-old son,

09:38.578 --> 09:41.036
who's the same age
I was when I had him.

09:43.537 --> 09:47.662
My son is nervous,
because we've arrived
at the ape pit.

09:50.245 --> 09:51.870
Tell me, Sally,

09:51.870 --> 09:53.245
what's in the ape pit?

09:54.704 --> 09:55.704
Apes.

09:55.704 --> 09:57.912
Okay, Barry, yes,
we have established

09:57.912 --> 10:01.161
we're in your bedroom,
so what do you see?

10:01.161 --> 10:02.537
Um...

10:04.495 --> 10:08.412
Toy chest?
Don't use Nick's room.

10:08.412 --> 10:10.787
The primary responsibility
of any actor

10:10.787 --> 10:13.995
is to create the reality
and let audience live there.

10:13.995 --> 10:15.787
Mm-hmm.
So, where are we?

10:19.662 --> 10:21.161
Anywhere.
You've been somewhere.

10:21.161 --> 10:22.620
Come on.
Where have you been?

10:22.620 --> 10:25.412
Uh, grocery store.
Are you asking me
or you telling me?

10:25.412 --> 10:26.578
No, I've been
to a grocery store.

10:26.578 --> 10:28.078
All right,
we're in a grocery store.

10:28.078 --> 10:29.578
All right,
here we go.
This is great.

10:29.578 --> 10:31.203
What do you see
up there on the shelves?

10:32.954 --> 10:35.662
Gum.
Gum is
at the register, Barry.

10:35.662 --> 10:37.203
All right?
Here we go.

10:37.203 --> 10:40.203
We're walking
down the aisle.
Get your cart.

10:40.203 --> 10:42.120
Get your cart.
All right?
Pretend to do this?

10:42.120 --> 10:44.078
Do you feel--
do you feel the handle?
Yeah.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.954
Here we go.
Now, take a look around.

10:46.954 --> 10:48.036
What do you see?

10:49.995 --> 10:53.036
Soup.
You see soup.
What kind of soup?

10:53.036 --> 10:55.578
Umm...
Chicken noodle?

10:55.578 --> 10:57.245
Consommé?
I don't know.

10:57.245 --> 10:58.870
What do you mean
you don't know?
I don't know.

10:58.870 --> 11:00.245
Just look
at the shelf.
I can't.

11:00.245 --> 11:01.412
Why?
Someone bought it?

11:01.412 --> 11:02.870
No one bought it.
That's a lie.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.036
Take your hands out
of your pocket.
Don't slouch.

11:05.036 --> 11:07.412
You're stuck.
Barry, I need you
to surrender.

11:07.412 --> 11:09.328
No, no. Stay in place,
don't move.

11:09.328 --> 11:10.954
Take your hands out
of your pocket.

11:10.954 --> 11:13.328
Just... surrender.

11:13.328 --> 11:15.578
Surrender
to the soup, Barry.

11:15.578 --> 11:17.203
I don't know
what that means.
Let's pick a soup.

11:17.203 --> 11:18.912
I don't--
Let's pick
a soup.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.453
Your favorite soup.

11:21.453 --> 11:23.704
I just like broth.
I need help.

11:23.704 --> 11:24.912
Kids, please.

11:24.912 --> 11:27.620
What emotion
do you associate
with soup?

11:29.245 --> 11:30.954
Thirst?
Thirst?

11:30.954 --> 11:32.537
- Thirst is not an emotion.
- No.

11:32.537 --> 11:34.370
What is your emotional
connection to soup?

11:34.370 --> 11:37.704
Like for me, I feel like
it's somehow related to your
relationship with your mom.

11:37.704 --> 11:39.870
Like, maybe there
was sickness.
Sickness. Yes.

11:39.870 --> 11:41.870
Yeah, like
stomachache or the flu.
Yeah.

11:41.870 --> 11:44.662
Cancer. Yeah, dozens.
There are so many cancers.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.203
- Can we stay on topic?
- Yeah, it's probably

11:47.203 --> 11:50.495
most likely
about the mother, like--
Excuse me.

11:50.495 --> 11:52.995
I'm Detective Moss.
This is Detective Loach.

11:52.995 --> 11:54.954
Lovely.
We're in the middle
of a class.

11:54.954 --> 11:58.704
We would like
to speak with you
all about Ryan Madison.

12:01.036 --> 12:03.829
All right,
let's take a hard five.

12:03.829 --> 12:06.036
You think about--
Take your hands out
of your pocket.

12:06.036 --> 12:07.370
Jesus.
Think soup.

12:07.370 --> 12:09.662
Let's do this
in my office.

12:11.078 --> 12:14.495
Stovka, let me
tell you something.

12:14.495 --> 12:18.954
You get on the 10 freeway,
it's the Christopher Columbus
Transcontinental Highway.

12:18.954 --> 12:22.662
You can just drive
and become whoever
you want to be.

12:22.662 --> 12:25.412
This is the country
that invented Superman.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.704
And the women.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.870
Oh my God, the women here!

12:28.870 --> 12:31.370
Stovka, they would love
that accent of yours.

12:31.370 --> 12:36.203
If-- I know-- I know
a couple of gals in Cleveland
who would love to--

12:36.203 --> 12:38.578
How-- how old a guy
are you, Stovka?

12:38.578 --> 12:40.745
Forty-five.

12:40.745 --> 12:42.787
Jesus Christ.

12:42.787 --> 12:44.453
Okay. Okay.

12:44.453 --> 12:47.704
Uh, I-- I know one gal--
There's nothing for me.

12:49.245 --> 12:51.829
I had a wife,

12:51.829 --> 12:53.870
a child.

12:53.870 --> 12:55.870
But they leave me.

12:57.286 --> 12:59.537
She say I'm broken.

13:00.870 --> 13:03.412
You talk of freedom?

13:03.412 --> 13:06.078
As long as I work
for them, I never free.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.286
It will always be the same.

13:10.745 --> 13:12.745
My whole life...

13:12.745 --> 13:14.954
ever since a child...

13:14.954 --> 13:16.787
is death.

13:20.328 --> 13:22.412
There is only

13:22.412 --> 13:24.954
one true way out.

13:27.161 --> 13:28.704
Yeah, I caught
about half of that, Stov.

13:28.704 --> 13:31.120
If you could take
my cell phone out of my--
my pocket here,

13:31.120 --> 13:33.453
I could show you one gal--
she's Cherokee!

13:33.453 --> 13:35.036
She's really wild.

13:46.286 --> 13:47.578
What did you do?

13:51.120 --> 13:52.412
Okay, your name?

13:52.412 --> 13:54.787
Barry Berkman.
Sasha Baxter.

13:54.787 --> 13:57.036
Sally Reed.
And your occupation.

13:57.036 --> 14:00.412
I'm an actor...
and-- and a barista.

14:00.412 --> 14:02.537
I'm an actress.
I work in auto parts.

14:02.537 --> 14:05.912
I manage
three franchises
of "Coors" gym.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.870
What?
"Coors."

14:07.870 --> 14:09.203
- Coors?
- "Coors."

14:09.203 --> 14:10.453
- Coors?
- Curves.

14:10.453 --> 14:12.453
Oh, Curves.
Right, Curves.
Curves. The gym. The gym.

14:12.453 --> 14:15.161
I just did this
web series-- well, it wasn't--
it wasn't a web series.

14:15.161 --> 14:20.704
It was a YouTube video,
but, umm-- but it's...
up to 249 views.

14:20.704 --> 14:22.912
Do you have any water?
You seem a little nervous.

14:22.912 --> 14:24.704
Nope.
Am I under oath?

14:24.704 --> 14:27.620
Did you kill him?
No.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.161
- What? How?
- How?

14:39.120 --> 14:40.203
Can I have a little more?

14:40.203 --> 14:41.829
What's your impression
of Mr. Madison?

14:41.829 --> 14:43.620
He was my best wingman.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.245
He was the bait.
I was the...

14:46.245 --> 14:47.870
the stick to fish with.

14:47.870 --> 14:49.495
He just seemed
like a good dude.

14:49.495 --> 14:51.161
Ryan and I did a bunch
of scenes together.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.495
We did Shakespeare in Love.
Have you seen that movie?
Uh-uh.

14:53.495 --> 14:56.161
We did Breaking the Waves.
Have you seen that movie?
Uh-uh.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.662
We did Dogville.
Have you seen that movie?

14:57.662 --> 14:58.995
No. No, wait.
I saw that one.
Mm-mm.

14:58.995 --> 15:00.578
We did a scene
from True Blood,

15:00.578 --> 15:03.328
he did a lot of talking,
and I didn't really get
to say much.

15:03.328 --> 15:04.829
Is there anything else
you can think of

15:04.829 --> 15:07.578
that would be helpful
in the investigation?

15:07.578 --> 15:10.161
No.
Okay. So, thank you
for coming in, Mr. Berkman.

15:10.161 --> 15:12.328
Yeah? Okay.
Thank you, guys.
Yup, you're good.

15:23.036 --> 15:24.370
Fucking idiot.

15:24.370 --> 15:27.787
Someplace else
you need to be, Barry?
No. No.

15:27.787 --> 15:32.078
Hey, uh, Mr. Cousineau,
I'm really sorry about
my exercise in class.

15:32.078 --> 15:33.954
I-- I really--
I couldn't see anything.

15:33.954 --> 15:35.704
Barry, you want
to be an actor?
Mm-hmm.

15:35.704 --> 15:37.704
You better get out
of your own way.
Okay.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.537
Life is about taking a risk,
making the unsafe choice.

15:41.537 --> 15:44.453
Okay.
All right, here's a little
story just to illustrate.

15:44.453 --> 15:48.870
I once auditioned
for the guy that robbed
the house on Full House,

15:48.870 --> 15:52.704
and I carried a loaded Beretta
with me into the audition

15:52.704 --> 15:56.578
just to feel
the weight of it.
Wow.

15:56.578 --> 15:59.870
Did you get the part?
Oh, they freaked out.

15:59.870 --> 16:02.036
Now look,
you're in a shell.

16:02.036 --> 16:05.787
You need to break out,
and I've got the perfect
anecdote for you.

16:05.787 --> 16:08.704
10cc's of pure Mamet.

16:10.912 --> 16:13.704
Mamet?
Yeah, you're gonna play Blake

16:13.704 --> 16:17.245
in Glengarry Glen Ross,
the movie.

16:17.245 --> 16:19.328
I'm gonna send you
the pages.

16:19.328 --> 16:21.704
Here's my only direction:

16:21.704 --> 16:23.954
let the cat out.

16:24.995 --> 16:26.412
- Good night.
- Good night.

16:26.412 --> 16:28.245
Hey, Barry.
Hey.

16:28.245 --> 16:30.203
Hey. I booked an audition.
Oh, cool.

16:30.203 --> 16:33.578
Well, actually, Mike said
that the producers asked
for me by name.

16:33.578 --> 16:35.412
Oh wow.
Wait, who's Mike?

16:35.412 --> 16:36.537
My agent.
Oh.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.245
Well, actually,
he hip-pocketed me,

16:38.245 --> 16:40.078
but once I book something,
he'll be my agent.

16:40.078 --> 16:41.745
That seems fair.
Mmm. Can you drive me?

16:41.745 --> 16:44.078
It would really help
to run lines in the car.

16:44.078 --> 16:45.328
Umm...

16:46.620 --> 16:48.620
I can't.

16:48.620 --> 16:49.870
Oh. Okay.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.787
Well, how--
how long will it take?

16:52.787 --> 16:54.078
Not long. I promise.

16:59.995 --> 17:01.704
Hey, Detective.
Mmm?

17:01.704 --> 17:04.453
You know, I've done
my share of ride-alongs.

17:04.453 --> 17:06.537
I know the ins and outs
of your profession.

17:06.537 --> 17:10.203
Mm-hmm?
From where
I'm standing,

17:10.203 --> 17:12.120
you check all the boxes.

17:13.537 --> 17:15.036
What the fuck are
you supposed to be?

17:15.036 --> 17:16.787
I run this place.

17:18.161 --> 17:20.829
I'm gonna call you.

17:25.328 --> 17:26.620
I-- I swear.

17:26.620 --> 17:28.954
I-- I was just making
friendly chitchat.

17:28.954 --> 17:31.704
I wasn't-- I wasn't pulling
any Hannibal Lecter shit.

17:31.704 --> 17:34.870
Why would he do this?

17:34.870 --> 17:37.995
He was at top
of his profession.

17:39.412 --> 17:41.328
I cannot tell my family.

17:42.245 --> 17:45.036
They will be very angry.

17:46.286 --> 17:48.328
This might destroy us.

17:48.328 --> 17:51.412
I can see you're feeling
a bit insecure,

17:51.412 --> 17:53.328
and I'm surprised.

17:53.328 --> 17:55.078
But, to be honest,

17:55.078 --> 17:58.078
I find it refreshing
you're open with your feelings.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.245
Nah. It is weak.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.412
No!

18:01.412 --> 18:03.286
That's your family talking.

18:03.286 --> 18:05.120
They clearly did
a number on you.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.829
No, what you need,
if we're being honest,

18:07.829 --> 18:09.537
is a world-class assassin,

18:09.537 --> 18:12.161
and I happen to be
very close with one.

18:13.704 --> 18:15.036
Barry?

18:15.036 --> 18:17.829
That's your son?
The little boy who fell
in the ape pit?

18:17.829 --> 18:19.870
Yeah.

18:19.870 --> 18:22.036
And when he was down there,
he learned a few things...

18:22.036 --> 18:26.161
about how life
doesn't always go
according to plan,

18:26.161 --> 18:28.495
and when
you need a friend,

18:28.495 --> 18:31.370
sometimes you find one
in unexpected places.

18:32.620 --> 18:35.870
You're right.
No. They're right.

18:35.870 --> 18:38.245
These animals have
so much to teach us.

18:38.245 --> 18:40.245
They're...
incredible creatures?

18:40.245 --> 18:42.745
Yeah.
"Incredible"
or "amazing"?

18:42.745 --> 18:44.578
"They're amazing creatures."

18:44.578 --> 18:46.412
They're amazing creatures.

18:46.412 --> 18:49.870
Uninhibited,
intuitive, empathetic.

18:51.870 --> 18:53.912
That was amazing.
Thanks.

18:53.912 --> 18:55.203
Hey, do you think--

18:55.203 --> 18:59.704
you know, when Cousineau
sends me the Mamet stuff,

18:59.704 --> 19:01.995
do you think maybe
you could help me--
Sally?

19:01.995 --> 19:03.245
We're ready
for you now.

19:03.245 --> 19:04.578
With me luck.
Good luck.

19:06.286 --> 19:07.620
Hey, you'll wait
for me, right?

19:08.787 --> 19:11.620
Oh... uh, yeah. Sure.

19:15.745 --> 19:17.829
Thank you. Hi.

19:17.829 --> 19:19.412
Hi.

19:20.453 --> 19:22.120
Sally.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.161
Liv?

19:24.286 --> 19:26.412
Hey, girl!
Hi.

19:26.412 --> 19:29.120
Oh my gosh. It's so good--
Hi.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.453
Sally and I did six episodes

19:31.453 --> 19:33.912
of this show
about roller derby together.

19:33.912 --> 19:36.620
Sally here was the star.

19:36.620 --> 19:39.745
You-- you look great.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.787
Thank you.
Wow. I-- wow.

19:41.787 --> 19:43.537
So do you.
Oh, thanks.

19:43.537 --> 19:45.161
Skinny.

19:45.161 --> 19:47.787
- So, what was the show?
- Oh, you never heard of it.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.912
It never aired.
It was really good.

19:49.912 --> 19:52.704
We just got a little unlucky
with the timing of some
world events.

19:52.704 --> 19:54.620
Oh, that's too bad.
What was it called?

19:54.620 --> 19:56.954
Bonnie
and the Boston Bombers.

19:56.954 --> 19:58.286
Oh shit.

19:58.286 --> 20:01.453
Yeah, it was tragic--
both things, obviously.

20:01.453 --> 20:04.286
Super tragic. I--
Super tragic.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.161
So, wait, do you work
for the casting people now?

20:08.161 --> 20:09.870
No.

20:09.870 --> 20:12.495
Wh-- No, no, I'm--
I'm on the show.

20:12.495 --> 20:17.537
I'm the one
who bought the zoo.

20:21.453 --> 20:25.078
It's--
It's-- You're the lead?
It's your--

20:25.078 --> 20:28.328
Wow. Wow!

20:28.328 --> 20:30.370
That is... awesome.

20:30.370 --> 20:34.412
Listen, so I asked casting
to bring you in for this.

20:34.412 --> 20:37.286
Mm-hmm.
They did not think
you were right...

20:37.286 --> 20:39.328
Mm-hmm.
...but I fought for you...

20:39.328 --> 20:42.745
Mm-hmm.
...because I really, really,
really want you to get this.

20:42.745 --> 20:44.495
Thank you.

20:44.495 --> 20:46.245
Break a leg, okay?

20:48.203 --> 20:50.954
That was your son?

20:50.954 --> 20:54.412
What? The little boy
that fell in the ape pit?

20:56.662 --> 21:00.161
Yeah. And when
I was down there, I--

21:00.161 --> 21:02.704
Oh. Sorry. Umm...

21:04.537 --> 21:09.495
Yeah, and when
he was down there,
he learned a few things...

21:09.495 --> 21:13.120
about how life doesn't always
go according to plan,

21:13.120 --> 21:14.578
and, umm...

21:16.036 --> 21:17.829
I'm sorry,
I know this. I...

21:19.286 --> 21:21.370
About how life doesn't always
go according to plan,

21:21.370 --> 21:24.203
umm, and sometimes,
when you need a friend,

21:24.203 --> 21:26.870
you find one
in unexpected places.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.745
I'm really sorry. Umm...

21:31.203 --> 21:33.745
Can we just--
Can we start over?

21:33.745 --> 21:36.078
Yeah, well, see,
the thing is,

21:36.078 --> 21:37.495
you're scattered, Goran.

21:37.495 --> 21:40.203
You and your guys,
you're all over the map.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.078
What is it exactly...

21:44.078 --> 21:47.495
...that you want?
I want
what Bolivians have.

21:47.495 --> 21:51.620
They have stash house
in Sylmar that I know
makes so much money.

21:51.620 --> 21:55.203
Bolivians. Aren't they those,
uh, short motherfuckers?

21:55.203 --> 21:58.078
Statistically,
one of shortest
nations on Earth,

21:58.078 --> 21:59.578
but they are very mean.

21:59.578 --> 22:02.203
So, they got
a stash house you want,

22:02.203 --> 22:05.328
then that's what
you should go after,
the assets.

22:05.328 --> 22:07.662
You're trying to create
a mood with a bullet.

22:07.662 --> 22:11.120
Those are lateral moves.
This isn't theater.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.829
- It's business.
- Yes!

22:12.829 --> 22:15.787
DHL shows bullet
was delivered

22:15.787 --> 22:17.203
and signed for
10 minutes ago.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.787
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

22:19.787 --> 22:21.578
Hank. Leave.

22:21.578 --> 22:23.787
What? Come on, man!

22:23.787 --> 22:25.954
This is the thing!
Get out!

22:26.912 --> 22:28.245
Let grown-ups talk.

22:29.370 --> 22:33.286
I will go tell Barry then.
Jeez Louise.

22:33.286 --> 22:34.829
Thank you.

22:34.829 --> 22:36.495
Look, you want to get
a man's attention,

22:36.495 --> 22:38.537
take something away from him.

22:38.537 --> 22:40.995
What, uh, what's
this Bolivian fella's name?

22:40.995 --> 22:46.328
Cristobal Sifuentes.
He is... crazy man.

22:46.328 --> 22:49.495
No. Don't sell
yourself short, big guy.

22:49.495 --> 22:52.495
I mean, you...
you were about to take
all my teeth out there.

22:52.495 --> 22:54.161
You're a goofball too.

22:54.161 --> 22:56.161
Me?
You're a goofball.

22:56.161 --> 22:57.954
I'm goofball?
Yeah.

22:57.954 --> 23:01.954
Come on.
So... do something goofy.

23:02.870 --> 23:04.161
Take his stash house.

23:04.161 --> 23:06.328
Then when he comes
up here to LA

23:06.328 --> 23:08.328
to deal with that,
you kill him.

23:09.912 --> 23:12.662
You could have Barry
handle these things?

23:12.662 --> 23:15.662
Look, what are we thinking
about this lock, huh?

23:15.662 --> 23:17.203
Seems like a remnant.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.537
Fuck!

23:33.578 --> 23:34.870
Oh. Hey.

23:34.870 --> 23:36.578
Are-- are you okay?

23:36.578 --> 23:38.829
Oh yeah, I had to cry
for the scene, so.

23:38.829 --> 23:40.120
Mom in zoo cries?

23:40.120 --> 23:42.537
My son fell
in an ape pit, Barry.

23:51.954 --> 23:54.870
It's okay.
This day sucks.

23:56.578 --> 23:57.745
I'm sorry.

23:59.704 --> 24:02.370
Hey. Let's go
do something.

24:02.370 --> 24:05.704
Well, I'd, um-- I'd love to,
but I gotta go to work.

24:06.912 --> 24:09.203
I thought
you gave notice.

24:09.203 --> 24:12.203
I did, but, um,
this delivery showed up

24:12.203 --> 24:14.829
last second.
I've gotta go
take care of it.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.787
Call in sick.

24:18.912 --> 24:21.245
I can't.

24:21.245 --> 24:23.912
That's okay. Sorry.
I'm being a bitch.

24:23.912 --> 24:27.036
You gotta pay
the bills, right?
That's right. Fine.

24:51.036 --> 24:53.203
Jesus fucking Christ.

24:53.203 --> 24:54.829
Yup?

24:54.829 --> 24:56.537
Is it done?

24:56.537 --> 24:58.036
"Is it done?"
Hank, you know,

24:58.036 --> 25:00.036
I can't just walk up
to his front door

25:00.036 --> 25:02.662
with a big fucking gun.
That would be stupid. Right?

25:02.662 --> 25:04.328
Okay.
Look, I'm in position,

25:04.328 --> 25:07.245
and, uh, you know,
these things take
as long as they take.

25:07.245 --> 25:09.495
Okay.
Okay? It's called
being professional.

25:09.495 --> 25:10.704
Got it.
Right.

25:10.704 --> 25:12.620
It's just
that timing is key.

25:12.620 --> 25:15.036
Right.
Because to properly get into
someone's head, it is truly--

25:15.036 --> 25:18.120
Hey, Sally. Cousineau
gave me this Mamet stuff,

25:18.120 --> 25:20.995
- and it's got a lot of words.
- I was Bonnie.

25:20.995 --> 25:23.537
Are we doing another scene?
Liv was just one
of the Bombers.

25:23.537 --> 25:26.245
I was the lead
on the TV show.
She was just supporting.

25:26.245 --> 25:28.120
She was number five
on the fucking call sheet.

25:28.120 --> 25:31.161
That was four fucking
years ago, and what, now
she has her own fucking show?

25:31.161 --> 25:32.787
How can she be a millennial,
and I'm a mom...

25:32.787 --> 25:34.453
Shit.
...when we're
the same fucking age?

25:34.453 --> 25:36.829
I mean, that doesn't
even make any fucking sense.

25:36.829 --> 25:38.704
She was wearing a tube top.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.203
Oh my God,
it was so humiliating.

25:41.203 --> 25:43.286
- Maybe I deserve it.
- Fuck.

25:43.286 --> 25:46.495
Maybe I'm just
a shitty fucking actress.

25:46.495 --> 25:49.328
What? No, you're--
Come on.

25:49.328 --> 25:52.286
Sally, you're like one
of the best actresses
I've ever seen.

25:53.829 --> 25:57.453
Are you sure
you can't hang right now?

25:57.453 --> 25:59.870
Look, I'd really like to,
but I can't.

26:01.286 --> 26:03.995
I don't wanna be alone.

26:07.704 --> 26:08.995
Barry?

26:13.995 --> 26:16.161
I'll be over in half an hour.

26:58.161 --> 27:00.036
- No tienes  que hacer esto!
-  Shit.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.578
No tienes
que hacer esto!

27:08.745 --> 27:11.120
It's like a flannel--

27:11.120 --> 27:14.120
Anyway...
No tienes
que hacer esto!

27:20.245 --> 27:21.704
No tienes
que hacer esto!

27:21.704 --> 27:23.286
No tienes que hacer esto!

27:56.995 --> 27:59.370
The more I think about it,
the more I think

27:59.370 --> 28:01.328
that Liv planned that whole
thing just to embarrass me.

28:01.328 --> 28:04.537
You know, she was always
such an operator, and I'm not
the only one who felt that way.

28:04.537 --> 28:06.453
All the Bombers,
they all hated her.

28:06.453 --> 28:09.578
We weren't supposed to know
this, but the producer secretly
got her acting lessons.

28:09.578 --> 28:11.954
Yeah. I take them
for the craft.

28:11.954 --> 28:13.954
- Hello?
- Hey, man, how's it going?

28:13.954 --> 28:15.829
- It's done.
- Sitting on good news--

28:15.829 --> 28:17.662
Release Fuches.

28:17.662 --> 28:20.620
I don't know
if you know this, but you have
herpes for life. Life.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.412
That's why all those guys
keep breaking up with her.

28:22.412 --> 28:24.036
I mean, she's
the common denominator.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.078
I know I said
she was the same age as me...

28:26.078 --> 28:27.995
...but she's been fucking lying
about her age for years.

28:27.995 --> 28:29.578
Yeah, my friend Amy,
one of the other Bombers,

28:29.578 --> 28:30.912
she had a nightmare
about her last night.

28:30.912 --> 28:32.787
She has leukemia, that's--
You just passed my house.

28:42.161 --> 28:43.704
Do you think
I'm gonna be a star?

28:45.078 --> 28:47.704
Like a movie star? Yeah.

28:47.704 --> 28:49.662
You're, like,
the best actress I've ev--

29:05.704 --> 29:07.036
What kind of soup
do you want?

29:07.036 --> 29:09.495
Lentil vegetable?
Yeah. That's fine.

29:10.620 --> 29:13.787
All right,
what else we got?
Some gum?

29:19.120 --> 29:20.870
No tienes
que hacer esto!

29:22.870 --> 29:25.161
No-- No tienes
que hacer esto!

29:28.370 --> 29:30.704
No tienes
que hacer esto.

29:32.036 --> 29:33.870
Why did you say that?

29:34.870 --> 29:36.995
Umm, do you know
what it means?

29:36.995 --> 29:40.036
Mmm.
"You don't have
to do this."

29:44.161 --> 29:45.495
Yeah, I guess not.
