00:30.498 --> 00:32.700
Uh, Titans, have you noticed?

00:32.733 --> 00:34.202
Nothing is happening.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.170
So? Does something
always have to happen?

00:36.204 --> 00:37.705
Yes. Something
always happens.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.341
Sometimes it's forced,
or stupid, or not interesting,

00:40.374 --> 00:42.176
but something always happens.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.713
Perhaps we simply need to give
the something more of the time.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.751
Arg!

00:50.784 --> 00:54.322
It seems, nothing really
is going to happen today.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.490
Goods. I'm feeling
lazy anyways.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.825
I'mma grabs me a drink.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.260
Grab me one too, bro.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.298
Yo! Did somebody
move the kitchen?

01:04.332 --> 01:06.667
The kitchen should be
where it is the always.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.269
Well, it ain't.

01:08.302 --> 01:09.670
It's gone.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.107
My room.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.576
The elevator.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.479
Our world
is doing the disappearing.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.281
I'm freaking out, dude!

01:21.482 --> 01:23.217
Titans, we need to
get out of here!

01:23.251 --> 01:25.353
Aah! There ain't
nowhere to run.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.820
- What's that way?
- I don't know.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.323
We have never gone
the that way before.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.725
We don't have a choice.
Go! Go, go!

01:37.231 --> 01:38.732
Where are we?

01:42.236 --> 01:44.205
They are the obsessed with us.

01:44.238 --> 01:47.608
What kind of creeps have pictures
of us hanging everywhere?

01:47.641 --> 01:50.244
Guys, I feel like
we're being watched.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.882
The Titans?
What are you guys doing here?

01:54.915 --> 01:57.285
We ran the way we have never gone before

01:57.318 --> 01:58.786
and ended up
in this smelly dungeon.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.389
Yeah, smells pretty bad, doesn't it?

02:01.422 --> 02:02.590
You get used to it
after a while, though.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.392
All right, tells us who you is

02:04.425 --> 02:06.394
and who's all these
other people is, too.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.761
My bad, dude.
I'm Pete.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.397
And this is the crew.
Check it.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.832
We got Peggy and Luke.
Here you got Prez.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.435
Over there, that's
Eric, Jerry, Chuck.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.770
You got Battle, Pablo,
Marina and Anand.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.507
And here you got Keef,
Trevor, E. Rock,

02:19.540 --> 02:20.941
Candi, Sandra and Erin.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.443
Oh, and Sacco.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.744
What up, Sacco?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.947
And here you got
Camp, James and Stone.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.717
Over there,
that's Pringle, Hype, Romero.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.453
You've got Caps, Zach and Rob.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.422
Jeff, Adriel and Nick.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.425
And over there is Sam,
he runs the studio.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.705
Get back to work!

02:51.739 --> 02:52.840
You got it, boss.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.612
So, why do you have pictures
of us all over the place?

02:58.646 --> 03:00.314
- We make you.
- You make us what?

03:00.348 --> 03:01.515
'Cause I want a sandwich.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.417
No, no, no, no, no.
We make you.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.718
We make Teen Titans Go!

03:04.752 --> 03:06.954
It's a cartoon.
You do know that, right?

03:06.987 --> 03:08.889
Oh, I see.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.491
We's a cartoon.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.925
Of the course.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.361
Cool, cool.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.563
We're cartoons!

03:17.598 --> 03:20.501
I'm having an
existentialist crisis, yo!

03:20.534 --> 03:22.503
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!

03:22.536 --> 03:23.937
We ain't real!
We ain't even real!

03:23.971 --> 03:26.640
I feel as though I exist
as a fully formed person,

03:26.674 --> 03:28.576
but, clearly,
that is not the case!

03:28.609 --> 03:31.712
Titans, I know this
revelation is troubling,

03:31.745 --> 03:34.282
but we have a mission.
Stay focused!

03:34.315 --> 03:36.250
All of my memories are lies!

03:36.284 --> 03:37.785
Jump City is disappearing.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.587
If you really do make the show,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.922
then you have the power
to restore our world.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.625
Well, we're supposed to be
making our 200th episode.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.660
So, get to work, fool!

03:46.694 --> 03:48.262
We can't.
We need a script.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.498
And Michael and Aaron
haven't turned one in.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.932
Can't you just do it yourselves?

03:51.965 --> 03:53.534
Us? Nah.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.469
Michael and Aaron
created your show.

03:55.503 --> 03:58.005
Without them, we're lost.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.345
They are very important.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.383
Ha, ha, ha!

04:09.417 --> 04:12.019
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
I'm kidding. Everybody's replaceable.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.854
Then why do you not
replace them?

04:13.887 --> 04:15.989
Because we love the break.

04:16.023 --> 04:20.661
We've been working
nonstop for 199 episodes.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.596
It's a very aggressive schedule.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.334
If Michael and Aaron
don't write a story,

04:26.367 --> 04:28.369
our world will cease to exist.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.003
We need to find them.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.640
Check the studio.
They were supposed to
record your voices today.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.008
Our voices?

04:35.042 --> 04:37.678
And then he was like...
And I was like, "What?"
He was, "Yeah."

04:37.711 --> 04:39.347
- And he was still like, "What?"
- For real.

04:41.081 --> 04:44.051
Is any of you fools' names Michael or Aaron?

04:44.084 --> 04:46.454
- Who?
- He's talking about the writers.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.921
- Who?
- The writers.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.990
You know, those awkward guys,
usually sit over there,

04:50.023 --> 04:51.892
the one who's always
doodling with his head down.

04:51.925 --> 04:52.926
The other always has his
head hiding in his hoodie.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.528
Oh, yeah, the awkward guys.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.597
Um, no, they haven't
been around.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.898
Maybe Greg and Tara
have seen them.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.367
Greg. Tara.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.968
- Tara, how do I look?
- You look good.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.570
My hair looks fresh today.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.837
You look cute.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.039
Will you stop that?

05:06.073 --> 05:07.274
Chill, bro.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.943
What you put out into the
universe is what you get back.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.945
That Greg seems like a cool dude.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.014
They're all cool.
And they sound so familiar.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.584
That's because we're your voices.
Check it out.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.419
Me. You.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.820
Me. You.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.755
I'm Scott.
Titans, go!

05:21.789 --> 05:23.023
Hi. I'm Tara.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.359
You do mu voice?
You don't sound like me.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.860
I'm versatile.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.462
I used to do this voice a lot.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.930
Yeah, I wish you'd seen it.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.131
In Pretty Pegasus.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.433
Whoa.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.601
Whose voice does you do?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.135
Yours, fool.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.070
What's your real voice
sound like though?

05:37.104 --> 05:38.872
What're you talking about, Beast Boy?

05:38.906 --> 05:40.574
This is my reals voice.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.942
Weird.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.011
I very much enjoy the shoes.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.547
Thanks. I just got 'em.
I'm Hynden.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.615
Don't take my picture.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.749
Can you say it?

05:48.782 --> 05:50.451
- Say what?
- You know.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.052
- You mean "shabalo-boo-boo"?
- No...

05:52.085 --> 05:54.154
- You mean "shabalaba-ding-dong"?
- No, man.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.123
- You mean...
- Will you stop that?

05:56.156 --> 05:58.692
We need to find Michael and
Aaron before it's too late.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.394
Wish we could help you.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.463
I think you know more
than you're letting on.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.731
You're calling us liars?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.165
Maybe I am.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.834
No one calls us liars.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.111
Security.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.683
Ugh!

06:22.716 --> 06:23.984
Ow.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.686
I believe I had a staff
when I came in!

06:25.719 --> 06:26.887
Ah.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.692
I've been able to uncover more
information on Michael and Aaron.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.026
Here's a photo.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.995
- Yikes!
- Ew.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.097
I know.
They're very hard to look at.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.466
But look we must.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.601
That's why I brought us
to San Pedro,

06:40.634 --> 06:42.069
where Michael is from.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.538
Now let's see if anyone's home.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.839
Yo, Michael, open up.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.708
We know you're in there, man.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.578
You are not the Michael.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.846
I am Albert.
I am Michael's father.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.083
And this is Puno, Tutu,
Louis and cat is Zoli.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.885
And who is this little rascal?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.787
The pigeon don't have a name.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.455
Why would you name a pigeon?

07:01.489 --> 07:02.723
He makes the good point.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.525
Can't argue with that logic.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.528
Are you hungry?
I make it for you, shrimps and prime rib.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.762
Uh, no thanks.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.764
We just need to know
where Michael is.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.533
Michael!

07:12.566 --> 07:14.535
Michael!

07:14.568 --> 07:17.170
He is not here for you.
What is the problem?

07:17.204 --> 07:19.507
We just founds out
we're not real.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.808
It is the upsetting.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.610
I tell you something.
You listen.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.846
It does not matter if you
are real, or imaginary.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.015
Is what you believe you can do.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.950
My son, he wants to be a writer.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.885
I say that is a fantasy.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.887
I tell him, "Get a real job.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.123
"Work on the docks,
be a longshoreman."

07:36.156 --> 07:37.858
But, now, he's a writer.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.628
Even fantasy can be real,
if you believe.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.797
I can't understand
a word this dude says.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.567
I think he was saying
something uplifting, maybe.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.104
Do you know where Michael and Aaron are?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.607
I ask you question first.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.942
Why does Aaron's name

07:54.975 --> 07:57.578
come before my son's
in the credits?

07:57.611 --> 07:59.947
We don't know.
Maybe Aaron does most of the work.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.850
What? You call my son is lazy?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.692
Titan's retreat!
Retreat!

08:11.725 --> 08:16.129
You come back.
I make it, shrimps and prime rib for you.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.165
♪ Shrimps and prime rib ♪

08:18.198 --> 08:20.668
♪ Shrimps and prime rib ♪

08:20.701 --> 08:22.803
Man, that dude's
pigeons are fierce.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
Got me right here.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.540
You have the ghost hand.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.610
Aah! We's fading
from existence. Aah!

08:29.643 --> 08:31.645
Just like in Back to the Future.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.748
Whoa. That means if we can't
find those two lazy hack-writers

08:34.782 --> 08:36.016
and get them to write a script

08:36.049 --> 08:37.685
we'll stop existing completely.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.953
Then we better hurry up
and find Aaron!

08:42.956 --> 08:45.559
Oh. You must be
Aaron's son.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.094
Yo, where's your dad at?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.562
He's pooping.

08:49.797 --> 08:50.998
And who is this?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.100
That's my sister, Stella.
She's shy.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.768
Will you play with me?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.169
We're kinda busy.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.705
Lets play Fight the Bad Guy.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.973
You be the bad guy
and I'll fight you.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.809
We are not the bad guys.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.343
I know. It's pretend.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.646
You're just for pretend.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.915
Pretend. Pretend.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.182
Pretend?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.952
That's all we are.
Make-believe.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.621
Well, you can be
a little bit pretend,

09:13.654 --> 09:16.957
but that means you're
a lot real.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.226
Can you just tell us
where you dad is?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.128
I told you, he's pooping.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.831
Oh, poop.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.365
I'm a dinosaur.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.968
How did he do that?

09:28.001 --> 09:29.937
The power of make-believe.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.104
It's stronger than I thought.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.842
I got you.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.747
- I got you again.
- Aah!

09:42.415 --> 09:43.617
Aah!

09:44.918 --> 09:46.119
That is not the fair.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.755
Bite!

09:47.788 --> 09:49.022
- Bite, bite.
- Aah!

09:49.056 --> 09:50.223
Oof!

10:01.301 --> 10:03.771
I'm a gramasaur.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.678
All our leads have been dead-ends.

10:10.711 --> 10:14.014

cannot find them in the time?

10:14.047 --> 10:15.048
This.
