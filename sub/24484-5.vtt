WEBVTT

01:09.403 --> 01:10.362
Morning.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.448
Hi.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.998
What's going on?

01:21.040 --> 01:22.041
School.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.335
Maddie...

01:24.376 --> 01:25.711
What?

01:25.753 --> 01:27.379
Maybe that's not
such a good idea.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.465
Maybe there isn't a "good idea."

01:32.635 --> 01:34.094
I thought we could talk.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.013
Until you get called into work

01:36.055 --> 01:37.014
and leave me here all alone?

01:37.056 --> 01:39.391
Wouldn't do that.

01:41.352 --> 01:43.020
I'll be all right.
I'll be with friends.

01:43.062 --> 01:45.773
Take it slow, Maddie.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.239
We'll talk tonight.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.199
All right.

01:55.241 --> 01:57.743
Are you gonna be okay?

01:57.785 --> 01:59.078
Yeah.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.663
Love you.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.374
Love you, too.

02:03.415 --> 02:06.252
I'm picking you up after school.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.546
Madeline?

02:08.587 --> 02:10.881
I'm picking you up.

02:30.276 --> 02:31.443
Bosch.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.666
Bosch?

02:47.209 --> 02:48.210
Bosch.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.307
Harry Bosch?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.267
Look, maybe you should
come out for this.

03:03.309 --> 03:05.853
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

03:05.895 --> 03:08.814
Hey, here, let me help you.

03:08.856 --> 03:12.484
It's about your mom.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.863
Come on, kid,
you're not in trouble.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.867
Everything's gonna be okay.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.702
- -

04:03.744 --> 04:04.954
- -

04:09.166 --> 04:10.417
- -

04:51.542 --> 04:52.751
Bosch.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.753
Now you got surveillance
on my wife,

04:54.795 --> 04:56.296
on my kid?

04:56.338 --> 04:58.090
Frankie, where the fuck are you?

04:58.132 --> 04:59.717
You said you believed me.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.552
The longer you're out,
worse it looks.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.471
Yeah, I know.
Fuck.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.849
I know I kind of
spooked out on you,

05:06.890 --> 05:08.642
but I got shit
I got to take care of.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.227
I'm coming in, I am.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.937
Today. Now.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.565
Today, tomorrow.
Fuck it.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.276
Don't worry.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.820
I'm good, Harry.
It's all...

05:19.862 --> 05:22.406
it's all fucking cool.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.546
Sheehan's running.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.131
You just waking up to that?

05:39.173 --> 05:41.675
Check the backwards book.
I sent you the number.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.428
Sheehan?

05:44.470 --> 05:46.847
Called less than a minute ago.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.891
Man loves his Bosch.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.185
All the slack you cut him.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.235
Pay phone. Old school.
Rampart Village.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.654
Send somebody.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.449
See if there's video of him
coming and going,

06:05.491 --> 06:07.910
what he's wearing, driving.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.828
Who he moves and sits with.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.663
I'll get Pierce on it,
but you're dreaming.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.624
He knows how we do this.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.042
Well, maybe we get lucky.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.086
Yeah.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.341
Ever done Pilates, Detective?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.634
No, Your Honor.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.428
You pay $75 for
a quick trip to hell.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.473
Thanks for making
the time to sign.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.391
For a detective who's come back
after what you've been through?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.811
My pleasure.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.688
-Oh, Elias case.
-Somebody texted him

06:36.730 --> 06:39.149
from that number, and
lured him to Angels Flight.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.984
Cop?

06:41.026 --> 06:43.946
Subscriber's name
could be the tell.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.739
If we can get it.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.452
Catch him, J. Edgar.
Open season on lawyers?

06:50.494 --> 06:52.788
-That can't be a thing.
-Yes, ma'am.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.337
What a terrible thing
to witness.

07:00.379 --> 07:04.591
Yeah, well,
the department has resources,

07:04.633 --> 07:06.218
should he decide he needs them.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.261
Will he?

07:07.302 --> 07:09.721
Harry Bosch?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.098
Highly unlikely.

07:15.227 --> 07:18.272
Your coffee lady is, um...

07:18.313 --> 07:20.315
more scientist than barista.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.026
Well, I have a weakness
for those

07:23.068 --> 07:24.528
who take their work seriously.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.738
Like Howard Elias?

07:28.866 --> 07:30.617
He was a gifted prosecutor,

07:30.659 --> 07:32.911
truly, when I worked with him.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.875
-Thanks, Pallop.
-Thank you.

07:39.668 --> 07:43.005
Why'd he quit

07:43.046 --> 07:44.882
The system was imperfect,

07:44.923 --> 07:46.466
and there was only
right or wrong for him,

07:46.508 --> 07:48.385
nothing in between.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.387
Doesn't leave much
for the human factor.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.222
Nope.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.559
-The crusader.
-Once upon a time.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.811
No, he passed on
settling Black Guardian

07:57.853 --> 07:59.146
to go to trial.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.690
-So?
-Crusaders don't change.

08:01.732 --> 08:05.027
They take up new crusades.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.862
I would have
done it the same way.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.447
It felt wrong.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.033
Well, nothing's
gonna feel right.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.076
Look, you had
to let her go, Harry.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.287
She's got to find
her own way through this.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.788
Yeah.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.999
All you can do is-is
be there for her

08:19.041 --> 08:20.417
when she needs you.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.085
All right.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.671
I am so sorry.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.007
Yeah.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.467
Listen, Harry...

08:31.929 --> 08:33.263
...are you headed in?

08:33.305 --> 08:35.265
Not for a while.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.935
All right.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.771
Thanks, Grace.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.029
Hey, uh, deployment
meeting's gonna be

08:49.071 --> 08:50.364
pushed back an hour.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.074
Let me guess-- Callas.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.659
Yeah.

08:57.496 --> 09:00.165
Medical pension's
a beautiful thing,

09:00.207 --> 09:02.793
but I still crave
to be in the game.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.837
-Is that weird?
-The game is the game.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.466
You'll need to run
this dump through something

09:09.508 --> 09:11.009
to make it easier to search.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.886
Still got the software
you gave me.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.930
Your other number's
for a burner.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.473
No subscriber info.

09:16.515 --> 09:19.059
-Fuck.
-I'm sorry.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.145
These both for Elias?

09:22.187 --> 09:25.482
How long to get me
a call history on the burner?

09:25.524 --> 09:27.859
Three, four days.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.279
For a top-notch analyst
like you?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.321
I like "top-notch."

09:32.948 --> 09:35.575
You, uh, still...

09:35.617 --> 09:37.703
stuck on your ex?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.037
How about tomorrow?

09:39.079 --> 09:41.581
Friday.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.375
Earliest.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.179
Not wild about the hours,

09:56.221 --> 09:59.808
but the overtime
on this task force is going

09:59.850 --> 10:02.144
to be outstanding.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.938
Target headed north on primary.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.778
Got him.
Northbound, number one lane.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.113
Chief, what can I do for you?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.657
Had another interesting
call from Bradley Walker.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.618
His driver, Abe Rodriguez,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.912
has a CCW for a Glock nine.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.038
Keeps it in the car.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.581
What's the interesting part?

11:04.623 --> 11:06.458
Weapon was stolen
sometime Friday.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.960
Maybe even Friday evening,
while at the Biltmore.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.005
Driver file a report?

11:12.047 --> 11:13.799
Saturday.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.384
Walker just found out today.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.427
And out of an abundance
of caution,

11:17.469 --> 11:19.763
he would like you
to interview Rodriguez.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.973
Not much more we can do.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.601
Unless the gun turns up.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.436
President
of the police commission, Bosch.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.439
Perhaps you can
educate him on why.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.817
Bosch?

11:31.858 --> 11:35.737
Walker's just bent 'cause
I haven't followed up with him.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.323
Thank you for taking
care of it, Detective.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.367
Something else?

11:40.409 --> 11:42.160
Bosch...

11:43.453 --> 11:44.871
...I have some
small understanding

11:44.913 --> 11:46.456
of what you're going through.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.168
Yes, you do.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.004
Let me know how it goes.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.423
With Walker.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.466
Chief.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.516
Eh, I recognized you
from yesterday.

12:04.558 --> 12:08.311
Way you scope the scene.

12:08.353 --> 12:12.399
Uh, job like this,
we need to study people.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.819
Feds have the memories
from these?

12:15.861 --> 12:17.654
Copies.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.698
Don't get your hopes up.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.622
Kawasaki Ninja.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.791
It's a sweet ride.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.376
No plate.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.004
Ten grand, friend of mine spent.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.672
Likely stolen.

12:35.714 --> 12:39.009
You would not believe the tail
my bud gets with his.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.595
Can you zoom in?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.431
Closer.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.558
Right there.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.677
My mom.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.347
Cancer.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.724
I know what
you're going through.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.686
Let's get settled.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.235
I understand some people

13:38.276 --> 13:40.403
had trouble
with the homework last night,

13:40.445 --> 13:42.239
so before you turn it in,

13:42.280 --> 13:44.991
let's start by going over
questions seven...

14:35.667 --> 14:38.878
It's kind of pointless,
following Drake.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.213
I know.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.798
At least it got us out
in the world.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.216
I'm tired of doing
Bosch's grunt work.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.426
Hmm.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.761
Virgil Avenue vids were a bust.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.638
Nothing on his phone
since Sunday.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.056
Credit cards, ATM.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.558
Silence.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.310
Yeah, he's gonna make it
as hard as he can.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.858
Sergeants.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.444
00.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.862
Soon as they pull that bullet,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.322
we should walk it
straight to Firearms.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.198
Volunteer?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.367
I have to serve
that credit union warrant.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.493
I can go after.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.870
That's the way you do it.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.913
How'd it go with Drake?

15:13.955 --> 15:16.291
Bank, Starbucks, market.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.751
Comes out with a couple bags
of groceries,

15:17.792 --> 15:19.586
and for a minute,
we're thinking, "Sweet,

15:19.628 --> 15:21.129
maybe it's supplies
for Sheehan."

15:21.171 --> 15:24.674
But then, uh,
dry cleaner, car wash,

15:24.716 --> 15:27.218
consignment shop
to pawn an old laptop.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.637
Uh, liquor store for lotto.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.846
Laptop?

15:29.888 --> 15:31.222
Mm-hmm, and home.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.145
What?

15:37.187 --> 15:38.855
The laptop.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.649
Drake's a technophobe.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.150
Barely knows
how to use his phone.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.361
The consignment shop was a drop.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.744
Fuck.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.133
How's Bosch?

16:07.175 --> 16:08.385
Hurting.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.803
Yeah.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.806
It's fucked up.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.517
Harry put this in his pocket
when things went down.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.976
Forgot it was there.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.980
Sure.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.982
Find anything good
when you opened it?

16:24.109 --> 16:25.860
Have any idea who did it?

16:27.904 --> 16:29.072
We'll get there.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.574
So nothing yet.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.034
Detective.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.205
Between you and me.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.040
I don't want to be
chasing a killer,

16:39.082 --> 16:42.460
and watching my six
for an emotional lone wolf.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.546
Keep him close.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.340
I will.

16:47.382 --> 16:51.010
Then you have to worry
about both of us.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.572
You here about the gun?

17:11.573 --> 17:14.117
Relax.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.661
Friday morning,
I put it in the console.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.081
Early Saturday, get home,
go to take it out...

17:22.250 --> 17:23.918
Barrel lock. Who's got the key?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.754
Never seen one.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.506
Mr. Walker says the lock slows
you up if you need the weapon.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.216
But he's not the one
that got written up

17:30.258 --> 17:32.260
-when I made the report.
-Okay. Tell me about Friday.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.180
Boss had a morning meeting
in Atwater.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.223
Construction site on Flower
most of the day,

17:37.265 --> 17:39.309
a couple city things in between.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.895
Mayor's office,
a commission thing.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.104
Detective.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.689
You stay with the vehicle?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.858
In and out, you know.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.693
Shit.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.446
I thought I locked it.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.199
00
for the Biltmore.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.825
Parked close by.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.827
A few of us went over
to Bottega Louie.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.037
Drivers.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.872
I put their names
in my statement.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.665
Thought you'd want
to know about it.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.044
When I lock the car,
it doesn't beep.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.253
Made the dog bark.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.130
My wife wanted it turned off.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.300
I don't know how many times
I click this thing every day.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.052
I try to count, but...

18:14.093 --> 18:17.138
Apparently, not enough.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.808
Anything else you need
from my driver, Detective?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.060
What I need is the weapon.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.396
Without it, there's no way
to connect it to a crime.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.983
Just knowing the gun was stolen
doesn't help me.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.906
What's the latest
on Francis Sheehan?

18:34.948 --> 18:36.115
Still looking.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.325
That why I'm here?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.913
Chief told me
what happened yesterday.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.915
My deepest condolences.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.125
But the city's on edge,
and I asked for

18:46.167 --> 18:47.919
and expect regular updates.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.004
Yes, sir.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.257
You think I've wasted your time.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.383
Not at all.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.635
See something, say something.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.929
We'll keep it in mind.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.725
Sheehan came and got it

19:02.767 --> 19:04.352
30 minutes
after Drake dropped it off.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.770
I fucked up.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.980
No.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.481
Just outfoxed.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.316
That what Bosch will say?

19:10.358 --> 19:12.110
Bosch is the one
got outfoxed first.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.862
Don't sweat it.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.975
We'll block off Wilcox
at Homewood and De Longpre.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.060
That's as close to the station
as you're gonna get.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.270
What

19:47.312 --> 19:48.730
No. That's not the point.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.106
So we're still four days out...

19:50.148 --> 19:51.399
Sure.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.985
God forbid we agitate
the snowflakes.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.653
I say we send blue suits

19:55.695 --> 19:57.280
to broom them
the fuck off the street now

19:57.322 --> 19:59.782
and leave ourselves
less trouble at the other end.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.577
-Okay, they're not exactly
breaking any laws. -On the day,

20:02.619 --> 20:04.621
what if you're wrong, and this
all turns into a shitstorm?

20:04.662 --> 20:07.290
We have a mobile field force
here at De Longpre Park.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.292
Out of the way,
but immediately available,

20:09.334 --> 20:11.336
and coming from
an unexpected direction.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.212
Like the lieutenant
playing captain.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.214
I've made
some tentative assignments.

20:15.256 --> 20:16.507
I'll be in court.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.051
Sunday?

20:18.092 --> 20:20.053
Callas, you're on tactical.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.889
Orkin, the park.
And, Thorne,

20:22.931 --> 20:24.641
the immediate perimeter.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.059
I'm in drop, Grace.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.061
Taking the kids
to Exposition Park.

20:28.102 --> 20:33.358
Thank you all for your input
and cooperation.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.567
Mank.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.986
Lieutenant.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.572
See that
the final deployment roster

20:39.614 --> 20:41.449
is on my desk in one hour.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.702
Copy that.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.798
You've reached Detective Pell

20:56.839 --> 20:58.466
at LAPD RHD.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.761
Leave your name, message
and contact number, I'll...

21:15.066 --> 21:17.610
Any issues
with our commissioner?

21:17.652 --> 21:20.363
There's been a breakthrough
in the River Watch arson case.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.198
Do you know about it?

21:22.240 --> 21:24.033
Bosch.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.035
You said you'd keep me advised.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.246
And you said
you'd stay focused on Elias.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.248
A 40-year-old cold case
that, by your own admission,

21:30.289 --> 21:31.916
is running on fumes.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.836
Bennett and Pell have a POI.

21:36.879 --> 21:39.298
I'll look into it.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.492
Maddie's a responsible
young woman.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.994
I don't think you need to worry.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.454
If her plans changed,
she'd tell me.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.330
-It's only been a day.
-Yeah.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.332
The death of a parent
at any time...

22:13.374 --> 22:16.335
I appreciate
your concern. Thanks.

22:30.558 --> 22:31.517
Harry.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.019
Yeah, Grace.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.729
Is Maddie with Lisa today?

22:34.771 --> 22:37.398
No. Lise is up north
with her dad. What's up?

22:37.440 --> 22:39.984
Miscommunication.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.111
Huh. Can I help?

22:42.153 --> 22:44.322
-No, it's fine.
-Look, if you need

22:44.363 --> 22:46.699
somewhere to park her tonight
while you're at work...

22:46.741 --> 22:48.576
No, I got it covered. Thanks.

23:00.463 --> 23:03.341
Justice for Elias!
Justice for L.A.!

23:03.382 --> 23:05.093
Justice for Elias!

23:05.134 --> 23:06.427
Justice for L.A.!

23:06.469 --> 23:09.430
Justice for Elias!
Justice for L.A.!

23:09.472 --> 23:10.473
Justice for Elias!

23:10.515 --> 23:11.474
Hey, hey, there he is!

23:11.516 --> 23:14.268
Hey, hey, hey...

23:14.310 --> 23:16.312
Hey, hey, hey, come on!
Hey, come on, keep it moving!

23:17.522 --> 23:20.399
Hey, come on, come on, man.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.443
What'd I tell you?

23:31.452 --> 23:33.162
Maddie?

23:34.205 --> 23:36.207
Maddie, you here?

25:50.633 --> 25:52.218
Sorry.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.095
Into the ether again.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.097
No problem.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.644
We had a pool
at our house in Vegas.

26:01.686 --> 26:04.313
Every house had to have one.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.442
My mom could hold her breath

26:08.484 --> 26:12.071
and swim one side to the other
three laps without stopping.

26:13.864 --> 26:16.492
Sometimes I'd sit
at the bottom with goggles,

26:16.534 --> 26:19.120
watch her go
back and forth above me,

26:19.161 --> 26:21.706
trying to hold my breath
that long.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.212
You know that feeling
when you're...

26:28.254 --> 26:30.298
at the bottom looking up?

26:32.967 --> 26:35.553
Yeah.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.805
And you know if you sit there
any longer you might drown,

26:37.847 --> 26:40.391
but... you stay there.

26:43.352 --> 26:46.397
Your chest tight,
your nose, like, burning.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.860
You stay there.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.701
We'll make it.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.119
What?

27:00.161 --> 27:02.204
To the surface.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.206
We'll make it.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.301
Got anything to eat?

27:16.344 --> 27:18.012
I will look.

27:24.769 --> 27:27.480
Bullet went
through the fleshy part

27:27.521 --> 27:30.024
of her mother's hip,
lodged in the womb.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.776
Actually grazed
the girl herself.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.444
Still has the scar.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.071
Mother survived?

27:35.112 --> 27:36.697
Emergency C-section.

27:36.739 --> 27:39.408
It was an LAPD black-and-white
got 'em to the ER,

27:39.450 --> 27:40.910
saved both their lives.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.912
The girl never talks about that.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.747
26. UCLA.

27:44.789 --> 27:48.459
Slowly grinding toward her PhD
with a sense of special mission.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.211
Carries a ton of student debt.

27:50.252 --> 27:53.923
Likes oral sex, Octavia Butler,
Greek yogurt, whiskey sours.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.800
Girlfriend's got
a warrant hanging.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.135
Seattle.
WTO thing last year.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.137
You got all this
from her social sites?

28:00.179 --> 28:01.847
Here and there.

28:03.766 --> 28:06.644
Civil unrest is organic.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.105
And once momentum builds,
no one person can stop it.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.523
Nothing starts
on the streets anymore.

28:10.564 --> 28:11.816
It starts on phone screens.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.359
Spreads across platforms.

28:13.401 --> 28:16.070
She's got 13,000 new followers
on Instagram

28:16.112 --> 28:17.279
since Elias was killed.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.697
A crusader.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.783
Some of those were purchased,
of course,

28:20.825 --> 28:23.911
but... yeah, a new breed.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.955
So how does this help me?

28:25.996 --> 28:28.332
That hard, slow work

28:28.374 --> 28:30.960
of the old protest movements
had resilience.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.921
Now... it's a piece of cake
to post pithy slogans

28:33.963 --> 28:35.756
and gather your crowds.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.842
But just as easy to lose them

28:37.883 --> 28:40.136
to the next bright shiny thing.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.848
In here?

28:43.889 --> 28:46.142
Yeah.
It's a little more private.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.144
Take a seat.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.706
So, uh...

29:08.747 --> 29:11.709
-we waiting for someone else?
-Callas.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.462
Sorry. I was, um...

29:14.503 --> 29:16.714
I made some final adjustments
to the planned deployment

29:16.755 --> 29:19.967
for the protest,
per your earlier input.

29:20.009 --> 29:24.430
Are you wearing the uniform to
make some kind of point, Grace?

29:24.472 --> 29:26.265
I guess I am.

29:26.307 --> 29:27.975
Chief assigned me this job.

29:28.017 --> 29:29.477
I need to take it seriously.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.103
And so do you.

29:31.145 --> 29:33.939
Because if we can't respect
the chain of command--

29:33.981 --> 29:36.817
shake off the petty bullshit
and have each other's backs--

29:36.859 --> 29:38.652
we may as well be
on the other side

29:38.694 --> 29:40.613
of those barriers on Wilcox.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.574
Lieutenant Thorne...

29:43.616 --> 29:46.702
station security.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.163
Lieutenant Orkin, lost children.

29:49.205 --> 29:52.875
And Lieutenant Callas,
bus detail.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.294
I copied it up to command.

29:55.336 --> 29:59.340
Grace, I mean, come on,
we were just hazing you.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.674
It's nothing personal.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.384
Good.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.346
Because anybody not making
his or her post, for any reason,

30:05.387 --> 30:07.473
will be considered
insubordinate.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.391
Even if he is in drop.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.738
Uh, Harry.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.823
Uh, Becca told us
last night. Jesus,

30:24.865 --> 30:27.159
-I-I'm so sorry.
-Is she here?

30:27.201 --> 30:29.828
Yeah. Yeah, uh, Becca?

30:31.288 --> 30:32.831
Hi, Mr. Bosch.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.292
You know, if there's anything
we can do, just...

30:35.334 --> 30:36.877
Who is he?

30:36.919 --> 30:39.713
Ky. Hartman.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.591
-Where does he live

30:42.633 --> 30:44.093
He runs track.

30:44.134 --> 30:48.013
-He's nice.
-Harry wants the address, Bec.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.520
Here.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.148
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.036
Fuck.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.246
The robbery audit.

31:12.288 --> 31:13.831
I call bullshit.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.000
That's how
his sniper thing started.

31:25.509 --> 31:26.969
Mr. Bosch.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.637
Hi. I'm Ky Hartman.

31:28.679 --> 31:30.222
Another time. Let's go.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.610
Thank you.

32:28.322 --> 32:30.574
Shit.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.702
If initial angle
of the trajectory is right,

32:33.744 --> 32:36.622
bullet's somewhere here.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.582
But it wasn't when Central
looked for it.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.793
Glass would've made it tumble.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.378
Crims tried to factor that in.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.712
Hey, don't sweat it.

32:43.754 --> 32:45.130
We've got the slug from Elias.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.298
That's all we need.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.925
Did you lose something?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.510
My I.D.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.220
This always happens to me.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.347
Two confirmed bullets,
separate victims.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.516
Way better in court.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.351
You sound like Bosch.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.269
But how did he get there--

32:59.311 --> 33:01.480
Sheehan, the shooter--

33:01.522 --> 33:02.898
and how'd he get away?

33:02.940 --> 33:06.235
Maybe that's why
he chose Angels Flight.

33:06.276 --> 33:08.737
No camera coverage
along this part.

33:08.779 --> 33:11.156
Edgar thinks he must've known.

33:11.198 --> 33:13.033
A cop would.

33:13.075 --> 33:16.662
Okay, but wouldn't we have him
on cameras down on Olive Street?

33:16.704 --> 33:18.872
Or Fourth?

33:25.003 --> 33:29.174
Look, Maddie, go wherever you
want to, see whoever you want,

33:29.216 --> 33:31.385
but the world is not your friend
and I am your father

33:31.427 --> 33:34.179
and I need to know
where you are.

33:34.221 --> 33:35.556
There's an app on your phone.

33:35.597 --> 33:38.559
Takes about three seconds
to find me.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.644
You were the one
who made me download it.

33:40.686 --> 33:44.022
I don't want us to be like this.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.194
And I'm sorry if I embarrassed
you in front of your friend.

33:49.236 --> 33:52.823
I just wanted to get away
from school.

33:52.865 --> 33:56.201
Didn't want to ask permission
or explain where or why

33:56.243 --> 33:58.328
or anything.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.416
Okay.

34:02.458 --> 34:05.043
Are we not going home?

34:05.085 --> 34:07.421
No.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.047
I made a call.

34:11.508 --> 34:15.137
There's simply not enough of us
to get everything done.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.139
Edgar's treating us
like a couple of boots.

34:17.181 --> 34:18.557
You're covering the on call.

34:18.599 --> 34:20.934
Dump it on somebody else
if you'd like.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.811
There's a command decision.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.980
If you feel that you can no
longer pull your own weight...

34:25.022 --> 34:27.232
No, that's not
what we're saying.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.817
I am trying to wrestle

34:28.859 --> 34:30.360
a D-One from Bureau.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.738
Until I do, I hope that
I can depend on you two

34:32.780 --> 34:34.740
as I always have.

34:34.782 --> 34:36.784
So, this mean we don't have
to go with you

34:36.825 --> 34:38.410
to the Homicide meeting
tomorrow?

34:38.452 --> 34:41.997
Breakfast at Grand
Central Market is on me.

34:42.039 --> 34:44.041
-Ooh. Eggslut.
-

34:44.082 --> 34:45.292
Excuse me?

34:45.334 --> 34:47.419
Uh, uh, the restaurant, L-T.

34:48.504 --> 34:51.089
-At Grand Central.
-Okay.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.732
You sure?

35:12.110 --> 35:14.530
Yes.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.848
She told me
I couldn't sit there.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.766
Said it was taken.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.601
Yeah. Don't mess with her.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.563
Introductions?

35:47.604 --> 35:50.107
This is Drake.
I used to know him.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.442
Charmed.

35:54.862 --> 35:57.155
What the fuck's eating you?

35:57.197 --> 36:00.242
Black Guardian.

36:00.284 --> 36:02.828
Francis Sheehan
confessed to Bosch.

36:04.872 --> 36:06.582
You're Catholic,
right, Santiago?

36:06.623 --> 36:09.334
You know I am.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.670
Yeah, me, too.

36:11.712 --> 36:14.756
And we both know that confession
is bullshit.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.300
People say all kinds of things,

36:16.341 --> 36:17.968
especially when
they've lost a kid

36:18.010 --> 36:20.804
-and their life goes sideways.
-Hey, stop.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.851
Talk to Margaret Sheehan?

36:25.893 --> 36:28.145
I talked to you.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.564
It's not my story to tell.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.733
You lied under
color of authority.

36:32.774 --> 36:35.152
Did I?

36:35.193 --> 36:38.322
Frankie was in that bathroom
with him, not me.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.490
I can't see through walls.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.992
You gave him money today.

36:46.955 --> 36:50.792
Sometimes a man's got
to take a walkabout.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.461
Get himself straight.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.922
About what?

36:54.963 --> 36:56.715
Hmm?

36:56.757 --> 37:00.677
Afraid if we catch him,
maybe he flips on you?

37:00.719 --> 37:04.640
Is that what you wish
you would have done at Rampart?

37:05.682 --> 37:07.726
You could have.

37:07.768 --> 37:09.061
It's not the same.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.479
No?

37:10.520 --> 37:12.940
So, you were in there
with Harris

37:12.981 --> 37:15.484
and you know exactly
how everything went down?

37:15.525 --> 37:17.653
Yeah.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.906
Everybody chose an easy fiction
to avoid doing what's right.

37:20.948 --> 37:24.201
You don't bring down
a fellow officer, u-uh,

37:24.242 --> 37:27.079
because of what you believe
may have happened.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.458
You got so many unwritten rules
I lose track, Terry.

37:31.500 --> 37:35.128
The streets are muddy,
my friend.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.423
The rules are all we got.

37:43.637 --> 37:46.348
I mean...

37:46.390 --> 37:48.558
that's why you're stuck
in Hollywood

37:48.600 --> 37:51.186
with self-righteous fucks
like Harry Bosch

37:51.228 --> 37:55.649
and not working RHD
where you belong.

37:55.691 --> 37:58.485
Sheehan killed Elias

37:58.527 --> 38:00.237
and we're gonna nail him for it.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.286
And you can stay
the hell out of my bar.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.226
Is that Eleanor?

38:31.268 --> 38:32.519
Yeah, data dump.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.771
From her phone.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.775
Not in my house, J.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.819
What?

38:40.861 --> 38:42.612
We talked about this.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.281
What?

38:44.322 --> 38:46.408
Um, I don't think so.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.285
Okay, do what you want
on your own time,

38:48.326 --> 38:49.995
but do not bring
that dark shit here.

38:50.037 --> 38:53.206
This is the world we live in.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.042
This...

38:55.083 --> 38:56.460
Take it home with you.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.463
Lock the door when you leave.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.543
Hey.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.424
How are you doing?

40:26.466 --> 40:29.094
She didn't look real.

40:29.136 --> 40:31.429
Yeah, I know.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.479
Listen, Maddie, this afternoon
when I couldn't find you...

40:39.521 --> 40:41.648
You made finding me a big deal
to avoid dealing with your own--

40:41.690 --> 40:43.400
I don't know what,

40:43.441 --> 40:46.444
but I get it.
Won't happen again.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.259
Does the hurt ever go away?

41:15.473 --> 41:16.933
No.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.817
Closure is a myth.

41:27.819 --> 41:31.281
You sort of put it in a box

41:31.323 --> 41:35.493
and then when it gets out,
you, you wave, you go on,

41:35.535 --> 41:37.913
so you can get out of bed
in the morning.

41:39.915 --> 41:41.625
Why would someone kill Mom?

41:41.666 --> 41:44.044
I don't know.

41:44.085 --> 41:47.172
You have no idea?

41:47.214 --> 41:49.132
Something to do with her job.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.426
Playing poker for the feds. Why?

41:51.468 --> 41:53.678
I don't know.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.305
They wouldn't tell you?

41:55.347 --> 41:57.807
They're feds.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.518
Are you gonna go
after whoever did it?

42:03.521 --> 42:05.106
Not my case.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.691
That's not what I asked.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.489
You know, Mads, I...
I've tried to protect you

42:12.530 --> 42:16.076
from the darkness, to...

42:16.117 --> 42:19.371
somehow get in front of it
for you.

42:21.373 --> 42:23.917
Now it's got us both.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.380
I tried calling Reggie.

42:28.421 --> 42:32.175
I thought you would.

42:32.217 --> 42:35.720
Were they gonna split up?

42:35.762 --> 42:37.347
Didn't look good.

42:41.184 --> 42:44.104
We had a fight about it.

42:44.145 --> 42:47.524
Last time we talked,
we had a fight.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.276
Don't do that to yourself.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.569
What did she want
to talk to you about?

42:51.611 --> 42:54.531
At Du-par's, before...

42:54.572 --> 42:56.449
You.

42:56.491 --> 42:59.202
What did she say?

42:59.244 --> 43:00.745
Tell me everything she said.

43:00.787 --> 43:03.290
Maddie, I-I wouldn't know
where to start.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.208
Start anywhere.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.211
Please, try.

43:12.007 --> 43:15.844
Her love for you was absolute.

43:19.347 --> 43:20.724
I already knew that.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.058
Keep going.
