WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:03.671
(hip-hop music playing)

00:03.704 --> 00:05.673
ANNOUNCER: Snowfall.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.076
All new, Wednesdays at 10:00.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.244
On FX.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.581
(dance music)

00:13.614 --> 00:16.050
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Pose.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.822
PRAY TELL:
So, we got vitamin B,

00:21.855 --> 00:25.393
niacin, magnesium,

00:25.426 --> 00:28.662
calcium, zinc...

00:28.696 --> 00:30.731
And this is vitamin D3,

00:30.764 --> 00:32.766
which is really important
for people of color

00:32.800 --> 00:33.934
living with HIV.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.569
Can't I just take
a once-a-day multivitamin

00:35.603 --> 00:36.570
and be done with it?

00:36.604 --> 00:37.838
Not if you want to survive.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.075
Ain't no more sitting
on the sidelines, baby.

00:41.109 --> 00:44.044
And here are some Chinese herbs.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.779
You want to brew this
into a tea

00:45.813 --> 00:47.248
and drink it three times a day.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.749
That'll take care of your mind.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.418
-Your body will follow.
-Ooh.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.086
That smells disgusting.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.456
Yeah. * And they taste
like shit, too. *

00:55.489 --> 00:56.957
(Pray Tell chuckling)

00:56.990 --> 00:58.759
And don't ask me what's in 'em.
All I know,

00:58.792 --> 01:00.761
it really helped me
bring my numbers back up

01:00.794 --> 01:02.796
after I had that bad reaction
to the AZT.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.698
How the hell am I supposed
to keep up

01:04.732 --> 01:05.699
with all of this, Pray?

01:05.733 --> 01:06.800
You'll get used to it.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.904
I still haven't told anybody.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.941
(scoffs)

01:13.974 --> 01:16.944
No one's ever gonna
date me again.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.812
Who's gonna love me?

01:18.846 --> 01:20.214
I'm damaged goods.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.916
Okay. No. No, no, no.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.886
You can't think
about that right now.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.256
-(exhales)
-Baby, you have to focus
on your health.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.458
And you gotta tell Damon.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.060
Like, with a quickness, baby.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.329
I know you're scared,
but you owe that to him.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.131
I know.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.799
I will.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.837
Would you pass me some
of that bok choy, please?

01:43.871 --> 01:46.073
Mm, which one is that?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.808
The green stuff.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.944
(TV droning indistinctly)

01:50.978 --> 01:52.946
You need to eat more vegetables.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.315
Vegetables?

01:54.348 --> 01:58.085
Me and Damon lived off of
Sprite and beef jerky.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.653
-You can't do that no more.
-Why not?

01:59.687 --> 02:00.854
My abs never looked better.

02:00.888 --> 02:04.325
It's better for you
to be thick and healthy

02:04.358 --> 02:07.094
than cute and withering away.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.530
So you like 'em thick.

02:09.563 --> 02:13.133
I like them alive.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.769
They drummed you
right out of Hollywood.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.472
Now you come crawling back
to Broadway.

02:18.506 --> 02:21.175
-So, you see that lady
right there?
-Mm-hmm.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.943
That part was supposed to be
played by Judy Garland.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.847
But Judy Garland got fired for
being drunk in her trailer.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.349
(both laugh)

02:28.382 --> 02:31.285
Please, please tell me you know
who Judy Garland is.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.954
Of course I know who she is.
I didn't know that, though.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.624
How you know so much
about culture?

02:36.657 --> 02:37.958
Movies and books were
all we had.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.629
You guys have MTV and magazines
and all sorts of stuff.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.164
I like that about you.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.166
You're sophisticated.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.002
WOMAN (on TV):
What the hell are you doing
in there?!

02:49.036 --> 02:52.005
WOMAN 2:
Giving it a shampoo.
Good-bye, pussycat.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.907
(cat mews)

02:53.941 --> 02:56.176
RICKY:
Thank you for tonight.
I really needed this.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.578
I don't know why
you're thanking me.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.912
You paid for dinner.

02:58.946 --> 03:02.316
(laughs)
Yeah, I did.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.519
-I guess I should head out then.
-Yeah, it's getting late.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.987
-But I'm glad we did this.
-Yeah, me, too.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.356
It was fun.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.992
You, uh, think it's okay
if I crash here?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.026
-Why?
-It's the time of night

03:13.060 --> 03:15.229
when Electra brings
her boyfriends home.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.531
Shit gets weird.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.933
(laughs)
Yeah, I got you.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.870
Um, I'm gonna get you
a pillow and some sheets.

03:22.903 --> 03:28.108
This sofa is not that comfy,
but it'll do.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.178
Tomorrow's Saturday,
and it's my day off,

03:31.211 --> 03:32.613
so I like to sleep in.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.349
So please, kindly,

03:35.383 --> 03:37.851
let yourself out quietly.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.086
Sweet dreams.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.797
(sighs)

04:01.409 --> 04:03.143
What in God's name
are you doing?

04:03.176 --> 04:05.813
Oh, you were right.
That couch is lumpy.

04:05.846 --> 04:10.250
(chuckles) I figured you have
a big bed, so...

04:15.088 --> 04:17.458
No, really, what are you...

04:17.491 --> 04:20.694
what are you doing?

04:22.996 --> 04:24.932
I think I have a thing for you.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.635
(weak chuckle)

04:27.668 --> 04:33.106
You're-- You're going through
a lot right now.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.142
You're confused.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.451
("Whip Appeal" by Babyface
playing)

04:44.985 --> 04:47.688
* Whip me *

04:49.222 --> 04:51.492
This ain't confused.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.327
* Do it, do everything *

05:08.175 --> 05:10.978
* Somebody told me *

05:11.011 --> 05:14.982
* There'd be trouble at home *

05:15.015 --> 05:18.118
* 'Cause we never talk a lot *

05:18.151 --> 05:20.153
* When we spend time alone *

05:20.187 --> 05:24.191
* And how are we
supposed to know *

05:24.224 --> 05:27.060
* Know something is wrong? *

05:27.094 --> 05:28.996
* Well, we've got a way
to communicate... *

05:29.029 --> 05:31.164
I think I want you
to have me, too.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.166
* It keeps a happy home *

05:33.200 --> 05:37.070
* And no one *

05:37.104 --> 05:40.207
* Does it like me *

05:40.240 --> 05:43.143
* And no one but you *

05:43.176 --> 05:47.581
* Has that kind
of whip appeal on me *

05:49.049 --> 05:52.052
* Keep on whippin' on me *

05:52.085 --> 05:55.756
* You whip it on me *

05:55.789 --> 05:58.926
* Whip all your sweet,
sweet lovin' *

05:58.959 --> 06:00.193
* On me. *

06:00.227 --> 06:02.896
(door opens)

06:02.930 --> 06:05.165
(footfalls approach)

06:05.198 --> 06:08.569
PRAY TELL:
The category is...

06:08.602 --> 06:11.171
Live...

06:11.204 --> 06:13.006
Work...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.776
Pose!

06:39.967 --> 06:42.035
-Hey!
-Found it. Look.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.271
No.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.608
You like it?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.543
They did a good job, right?

06:49.577 --> 06:51.244
Yo, you look good as hell, girl.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.046
-Aah, a really good job!
-I love it.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.247
(chuckles)

06:54.281 --> 06:57.384
Yo, I can't believe

06:57.417 --> 06:59.286
that photographer ain't
tried nothing.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.822
You sure he didn't ask for
no kinky shit after I left?

07:01.855 --> 07:05.225
Nah, but it was
definitely awkward.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.060
He was aggressive and cruel

07:07.094 --> 07:08.328
in front of everybody.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.663
But I only put up
with his abuse

07:09.697 --> 07:10.964
because I was scared
that if I said anything,

07:10.998 --> 07:13.166
that he would tell
everybody everything.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.402
So I just kept my mouth shut.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.436
He lucky Ms. Ford sent me home,

07:16.470 --> 07:18.071
or I would have
kicked his ass again.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.973
-Mm.
-What?

07:20.007 --> 07:22.776
-You so cute
getting all riled up for me.
-Hey.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.645
Cut it out.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.614
-I got something for you
if you don't cut it out.
-I like you getting

07:26.647 --> 07:28.816
-all riled up for me.
-If you don't cut it out...

07:28.849 --> 07:30.651
(Angel laughs)

07:30.684 --> 07:34.221
My knight in shining armor.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.025
My baby.

07:45.332 --> 07:48.335
I must have done something right
'cause he didn't say nothing.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.270
Well, I'm happy.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.941
It came out good.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.376
I guess the campaign was
too important.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.546
-Hmm.
-I love you.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.049
I love you so much, Angel.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.054
I bet you girls gonna
look back at these pictures

08:07.087 --> 08:08.355
and talk about
the great beauty Angel

08:08.388 --> 08:10.290
that broke through
the doors for 'em, watch.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.959
Please.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.862
I want to show you something.

08:14.895 --> 08:18.331
What you trying to show me
that I ain't already seen?

08:23.904 --> 08:26.073
Whose place is this?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.241
-It's my guy Joaquin's.
-Hmm.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.843
We was at work,
and he asked me

08:29.877 --> 08:31.912
if I knew somebody
looking for a place.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.250
Blanca can't fit
all of Evangelista in here.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.086
Plus, this area's expensive.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.854
It's $450 a month.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.256
-It's mad cheap
for this neighborhood.
-Mm.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.659
And it's getting
real fancy real quick.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.194
With the lifestyle
you living, mama,

08:47.227 --> 08:48.528
and the places you going,

08:48.562 --> 08:50.263
you need to be living
in a place like this,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.666
next to all them fancy people
you'll be working with.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.435
You trying to get
a place together?

08:55.468 --> 08:56.770
-On our own?
-No.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.872
-It's not about me.
-Hmm.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.874
I'll stay home with Blanca
if you want me to.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.409
This will be yours.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.211
You make your own money now.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.213
And I need you to know
you can get this

09:06.246 --> 09:07.347
if you want it for yourself.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.782
You know, the last time
I had a place of my own,

09:08.816 --> 09:11.585
a guy got it for me.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.520
So I could be on retainer.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.388
His little plaything. (chuckles)

09:15.422 --> 09:18.626
Now I can get a place
of my own.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.430
My own place.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.769
You can see the piers from here.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.976
That's where I used to...

09:36.009 --> 09:38.311
where I used to pull tricks
with the girls.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.785
Same piers I used to deal on.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.357
(humming softly)

09:54.327 --> 09:57.230
-Gotcha.
-Wh-what?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.599
Oh.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.434
(laughter)

10:03.637 --> 10:04.738
What is all that?

10:04.772 --> 10:06.807
Hi.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.176
Hi, ladies.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.812
What's with Golden Girls
realness at our booth?

10:11.845 --> 10:13.346
They gave those old bats
our table

10:13.380 --> 10:14.948
'cause you finally decide
to join us.

10:14.982 --> 10:15.983
Please,

10:16.016 --> 10:17.651
take your time.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.286
You can't be late twice.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.355
I was up late last night.
I'm having a slow morning.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.192
-So slow you come in third
in a two-man race.
-Uh-huh.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.494
Okay, are you hens just gonna
keep wasting time clucking,

10:27.527 --> 10:28.962
or shall we proceed?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.463
Yeah?

10:30.497 --> 10:32.265
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.468
Hear ye, hear ye.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.637
The bi-monthly meeting of the
masters of ceremonies council

10:37.671 --> 10:39.172
is now in session.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.843
Manhattan, updates.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.211
Well, we used part of
the dues and donations

10:44.244 --> 10:46.046
to pay for Candy's burial,

10:46.079 --> 10:47.380
so we aren't gonna
be able to cover

10:47.414 --> 10:48.816
the trophies for the next ball.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.351
We all need to cover this.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.787
All right. Come on.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.055
-JACK: Oh, you're collecting it?
-Yeah.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.356
I'll collect it.
I'll go get them.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.891
-Thank you.
-CASTLE: That's all I got.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.527
(clears throat)
All right.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.065
Two dollars, bitch...

11:05.098 --> 11:06.399
-Mm-hmm.
-...that said,

11:06.433 --> 11:07.835
"We all need to cover it"?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.703
We all need
to help in the way that we can.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.005
-Oh, okay. Moving on.
-Thank you.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.308
The children are loving Candy's
Sweet Refrain as a new category,

11:15.342 --> 11:17.477
but now the butch queens
want to perform up in drags.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.012
Perfect.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.314
-Motion accepted.
-CASTLE: Just that fast?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.683
You always have an opinion
about categories.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.485
-Mm-hmm.
-That's not true.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.420
JACK:
Bitch, please.
You've got opinions

11:27.454 --> 11:30.423
-like these queens
got bleached assholes.
-Yeah.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.926
Nobody want it,
they're always offering it out

11:32.960 --> 11:35.495
-and you can keep it
to yourself.
-Are you in a rush?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.530
You got a midmorning date
you running off to?

11:37.564 --> 11:40.868
-No.
-Are you sure, sis?

11:40.901 --> 11:44.237
(chuckles):
You are positively glowing.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.405
I mean,
your face ain't even beat.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.274
Uh, what have you done
with Pray Tell?

11:47.307 --> 11:49.276
Well, you know, I've been
switching up my regime.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.678
-Mm.
-You know, I got some
new creams and unguents

11:51.711 --> 11:54.047
and lotions and potions
and stuff.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.516
You know how that goes.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.119
Okay, okay.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.720
I have a confession to make,
and you heifers

12:00.754 --> 12:03.223
better keep this shit
to yourselves.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.926
I've taken a lover.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.427
-Oh. (laughs)
-Finally.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.197
Last person to ice
your cakes was Keenan.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.932
-(laughs)
-MANHATTAN: Though,
why wouldn't you tell us

12:11.965 --> 12:13.901
-you've in love?
-PRAY TELL: I'm not in love.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.369
-I'm in lust.
-Is there a difference?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.105
Yes. Yeah.
It's not, it's not romantic,

12:18.138 --> 12:19.406
you know, but it's hot.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.074
It's-it's passionate.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.210
Every time I think about him,
I just start to sweat.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.946
And, you know, he got them eyes,
them kind of eyes

12:25.979 --> 12:27.948
that just pierce
right through your soul.

12:27.981 --> 12:31.118
-Mm.
-Washboard abs
as hard as granite,

12:31.151 --> 12:34.955
and a pair of the juiciest lips

12:34.988 --> 12:38.091
that he absolutely knows
how to use.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.260
For what, bitch? Finish.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.598
I'm just happy. You know?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.734
I haven't felt this way
in a long time.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.236
I can't even believe
at this point in my life

12:49.269 --> 12:50.670
I'm even saying
some shit like that.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.673
-(chuckles)
-JACK: Ay, bendito.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.642
I'm so happy for you--
Who is it?

12:55.675 --> 12:56.609
MANHATTAN:
So nosey. But for real,

12:56.643 --> 12:58.245
-who is it?
-Is it Ray Ray?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.347
That queen with the Jheri curl
that works at Union Square café?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.649
-(laughter)
-JACK: Ooh.
-No! Ew.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.417
-Ugh...
-JACK: Girl. Ray Ray?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.618
That bitch is so old,

13:05.652 --> 13:07.587
she was a waiter
at the Last Supper, honey.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.157
-CASTLE: Wow.
-Serving bread, fish,
water and wine.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.159
-MANHATTAN: Oh, damn.
-CASTLE: Oh, all the things.
-Mm. Ugh.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.627
JACK:
Y'all and this Ray Ray.

13:14.661 --> 13:18.331
(sigh)
He's a younger man.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.666
-Oh...
-CASTLE: Ooh!

13:19.699 --> 13:21.501
-She's cradle-robbing.
-PRAY TELL: See,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.470
that's why I didn't want
to tell you biddies nothing.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.338
MANHATTAN:
You know how complicated

13:25.372 --> 13:27.374
these young men are.
Always looking for a daddy

13:27.407 --> 13:28.541
'cause they're
financially unstable

13:28.575 --> 13:29.977
and scared of commitment.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.678
Aren't you unemployed, bitch?

13:31.711 --> 13:32.846
-Always.
-CASTLE: Ooh...

13:32.880 --> 13:34.481
-Life is a journey.
-PRAY TELL: Oh, is it?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.283
And one more thing.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.186
So many of these young black
and brown men have a complex

13:39.219 --> 13:40.487
when it comes to older men.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.155
Most of their dad--
no, I would say

13:42.189 --> 13:44.858
100% of their daddies hated them
for being faggots.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.960
Beat them, threw them out.

13:46.994 --> 13:50.263
So they turn to us for the love
and approval they were denied.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.401
Well, I think it's great
you're dating someone younger.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.502
(Pray Tell chuckles)

13:55.535 --> 13:57.304
They also have less baggage.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.239
Granted,
they can't afford to buy any.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.574
(laughter)

14:01.608 --> 14:05.545
-You are wrong, wrong, wrong.
-No. The only thing that matters

14:05.578 --> 14:09.249
is whether or not
he is laying that pipe, sis.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.485
-Ooh, the sex is fierce.
-(oohing)

14:12.519 --> 14:14.187
Well, do you, then, girl.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.056
Someone deserves
to have their back broke.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.557
MANHATTAN:
Castle is right.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.993
And don't ever be ashamed of
sharing your good news with us.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.594
Own your choices.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.763
CASTLE:
Mm-hmm.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.433
It's Ricky.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.401
-(gasping)
-What?!
-Oh, girl, no.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.905
-He's an infant.
-He is a man.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.274
-A young man.
-A very, very,

14:34.307 --> 14:36.343
-very young man.
-Well, who else

14:36.376 --> 14:37.710
am I supposed to date?

14:37.744 --> 14:39.212
I spend all my time
at the balls.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.714
-Someone your own age.
-You just said it was

14:41.748 --> 14:43.350
a good thing that I was dating
somebody younger.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.085
I lied to make you
feel better, whore.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.921
(laughter)

14:47.955 --> 14:49.622
Well, it's not gonna last.

14:49.656 --> 14:53.426
As a matter of fact, it's
already over. I'm-I'm gonna,

14:53.460 --> 14:55.628
-I'm gonna break it off.
-JACK: Why?

14:55.662 --> 14:58.431
Because of these
Judy judgmental,

14:58.465 --> 14:59.632
jealous jezebel bitches?

14:59.666 --> 15:02.135
-Wasn't that a lot of Js?
-Ooh. Yeah. J...

15:02.169 --> 15:04.104
JACK:
I mean, who cares if he's young?
I would rather

15:04.137 --> 15:05.738
be a babysitter than a nurse.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.440
Mm. Is he hung?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.576
So tacky.
But if you want to answer,

15:09.609 --> 15:11.744
I won't stop you. Yeah.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.747
Last night, we went at it

15:14.781 --> 15:17.750
from In Living Color
till 4:00 in the morning.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.752
-Damn...
-Bitch.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.821
My right thigh is cramping
just thinking about it.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.623
-Ooh...
-But what is his status?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.725
-He obviously knows about you.
-You know I ain't talking

15:25.758 --> 15:28.595
about nobody's status.

15:28.628 --> 15:32.832
Just suffice it to say,
we was... safe.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.067
CASTLE:
What about Damon?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.269
She gonna be pissed.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.770
I didn't steal nobody's man.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.172
He and Damon
were already broken up.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.309
The person I'm really concerned
about is Blanca.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.677
JACK:
Pray, no.
You're not Ricky's father.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.479
You're not even in his house.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.847
If you want to keep seeing him,
you should.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.782
MANHATTAN:
I agree.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.318
You deserve to be happy.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.685
CASTLE:
But we know you.
You're gonna torture yourself

15:52.719 --> 15:55.488
until you tell her.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.789
So just do it.

15:56.823 --> 16:01.494
* It feels good, whoo, yeah *

16:01.528 --> 16:03.696
-* It feels good... *
-Uh, uh, uh, uh.

16:03.730 --> 16:04.964
(laughs)

16:04.998 --> 16:06.833
This is my jam.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.203
* Yeah... *

16:10.237 --> 16:12.705
I have missed
Evangelista dinners.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.674
Well, you came at the right
time, because you know what?

16:14.707 --> 16:17.144
We got Pizza Rolls.
(laughs)

16:17.177 --> 16:19.112
Ah, wait a minute.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.948
Pizza Rolls?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.716
(sighs)

16:23.750 --> 16:25.852
These are loaded
with preservatives.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.820
Boy, we used to eat them
all the time.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.123
You said that they were better
than filet mignon.

16:30.157 --> 16:34.794
(English accent): Well, my
palate has become sophisticated.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.229
-Oh.
-(laughs)

16:36.263 --> 16:39.199
So, Miss Elektra
has finally let you eat.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.333
-(regular accent): Sure not.
-Okay.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.703
-Okay.
-(both laugh)

16:43.736 --> 16:45.338
Uh, I ain't gonna lie,

16:45.372 --> 16:48.841
I've missed being
an Evangelista.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.243
* It feels good... *

16:50.277 --> 16:52.479
Especially this past week.

16:52.512 --> 16:56.749
* It feels good to know that
you want to be around... *

16:56.783 --> 16:58.551
Where is everyone tonight?

16:58.585 --> 17:03.723
Um, Angel and Lil Papi
are on a date,

17:03.756 --> 17:07.160
Blanca is at the salons, and...

17:07.194 --> 17:09.696
-so it's just us.
-Hmm.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.598
* If the rhythm feels good
to you, baby *

17:11.631 --> 17:13.566
-* Let me hear you say *
-* Oh, oh, baby *

17:13.600 --> 17:15.368
* If the rhythm feels good
to you, baby *

17:15.402 --> 17:17.003
(chuckles)

17:17.036 --> 17:18.571
* Oh, baby... *

17:18.605 --> 17:20.940
You know,
I knew this moment would come.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.242
(sighs)

17:22.275 --> 17:23.943
What moment?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.878
I've done a lot of thinking,

17:25.912 --> 17:30.450
and I've come to some clarity,
and so, yes.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.453
I'll take you back.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.722
* 'Cause you know
it feels good... *

17:35.755 --> 17:37.957
-(chuckles)
-I don't want
to punish you anymore.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.759
* It feels good... *

17:39.792 --> 17:43.396
-Damon, um...
-Oh, no,
before you say anything,

17:43.430 --> 17:46.733
just please promise me
that you'll be faithful.

17:46.766 --> 17:47.867
Please.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.769
* Having you around... *

17:49.802 --> 17:51.904
I have something to tell you.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.207
Oh, dear. Please don't tell me
you're dating somebody.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.243
(music stops)

18:07.854 --> 18:09.356
I tested positive.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.260
(laughs)

18:13.293 --> 18:15.295
Boy, what?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.803
I have HIV.

18:42.389 --> 18:46.259
I-I just don't understand.

18:46.293 --> 18:49.829
We just got-got tested
and we both tested negative.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.665
I-I know.
I got a call from Chris, um...

18:52.699 --> 18:54.834
H-He was sick, and-and
he thought it was the flu,

18:54.867 --> 18:56.836
but then he seroconverted, uh...

18:56.869 --> 19:01.341
You told me y'all didn't sleep
together while we were together.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.943
-I know. I fucked up.
-You lied to me.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.545
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

19:05.578 --> 19:08.481
-That's what you got
to offer me?
-I know!

19:08.515 --> 19:10.483
I need to grow up.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.786
That's why I've been
spending time with Pray Tell.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.989
Why did you go to Pray
before you come to me?

19:19.992 --> 19:23.162
He's been teaching me things.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.932
Teaching you what?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.369
(quietly):
Um...

19:36.909 --> 19:41.013
Did you tell him
that you was a liar? Hmm?

19:44.584 --> 19:47.354
You know what, I don't want
to talk to you anymore.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.389
(sniffles)

19:51.391 --> 19:54.193
Just promise me
you'll get tested.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.862
I'm not promising you shit!

19:58.398 --> 20:01.133
I never meant to expose you.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.941
I just hope that...

20:08.975 --> 20:10.243
(sniffles)

20:10.277 --> 20:12.279
...someday,
you can believe that.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.382
Get out.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.085
Get the fuck out!

20:30.430 --> 20:31.664
(screams)

21:09.168 --> 21:10.637
What are those moves?

21:10.670 --> 21:12.639
She looks like a pigeon
with a busted foot.

21:19.178 --> 21:22.048
(cheering, applause)

21:26.519 --> 21:29.288
(speaking indistinctly)

21:33.159 --> 21:33.993
(cheering, applause)

21:34.026 --> 21:37.630
Yeah! Go Damon!

22:36.222 --> 22:40.059
(cheering, whooping)

22:46.198 --> 22:47.366
LIL PAPI:
That's my brother!

22:47.400 --> 22:51.237
That's my brother!
That's my brother!

22:51.270 --> 22:52.505
That's my brother!

22:52.539 --> 22:54.306
(cheering and applause)

22:59.078 --> 23:01.080
Right here.
One, two, three.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.615
-(camera clicks)
-Happy graduation.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.751
All right, all right,
come on, let's eat.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.019
Daddy needs a drink.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.121
-You want a drink?
-HELENA: Blanca.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.323
Y'all go on on ahead,
I'll catch up.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.629
I hope you weren't gonna run off
without saying goodbye.

23:16.663 --> 23:17.997
I'm sorry.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.767
I just didn't know
what to say to you.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.834
What you did with Damon was...

23:25.304 --> 23:27.740
I just thought that anything
I said wouldn't be good enough.

23:27.774 --> 23:31.077
My gratitude for you is beyond,
you know?

23:31.110 --> 23:33.145
You don't have to thank me.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.214
I came to thank you.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.749
I could be the greatest teacher
in the world,

23:36.783 --> 23:40.419
but it doesn't matter if
the student doesn't show up.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.754
You held a vision for him.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.089
Like every good mother does.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.826
Yeah, but... you guided his way.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.161
You was patient with him
when he didn't deserve it.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.230
(both chuckle)

23:51.263 --> 23:55.835
And... what that boy did up
there today...

23:55.868 --> 23:59.138
that was the most
beautiful thing that I ever saw

23:59.171 --> 24:01.641
in my entire life.

24:01.674 --> 24:05.077
You know, the best students
I ever have are the ones

24:05.111 --> 24:07.279
who are imagining their legacy
every day.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.916
They don't want to be good

24:09.949 --> 24:11.684
or great.

24:11.718 --> 24:14.420
They want to be legends.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.789
They aren't afraid of dying.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.325
They're afraid
of not leaving their mark.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.594
Are you trying to say Damon
is trying to be one of them?

24:21.628 --> 24:23.930
-(both chuckle)
-No, he's got a bright future,

24:23.963 --> 24:25.364
but I'm talking about you.

24:25.397 --> 24:29.669
I knew it the moment
you barged into my office

24:29.702 --> 24:32.471
and gave me that speech
about your child.

24:32.505 --> 24:36.242
Demanded that I give him
an audition on the spot.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.213
I don't think
I will ever meet a mother

24:41.247 --> 24:44.951
who believes in her children
the way you do.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.753
Who'll fight for them like that.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.224
It's been a delight
to teach Damon.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.364
But it has been an honor
to know you.

25:04.236 --> 25:07.306
(sighs)

25:07.339 --> 25:09.308
You know we having a party
at our place.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.977
You want to come? (chuckles)

25:11.010 --> 25:13.312
(sighs)

25:13.345 --> 25:15.882
-Another time?
-Yeah.

25:33.432 --> 25:34.366
Uh, we running low on this wine.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.269
Not tonight!
Not tonight!

25:37.303 --> 25:39.271
BLANCA:
Listen, I...

25:39.305 --> 25:41.373
-I can't even believe my baby
done graduated.
-(chuckles)

25:41.407 --> 25:43.442
-Thank you.
-It--

25:43.475 --> 25:45.244
It was a long road,
but you did it.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.213
I'm so proud of you.

25:47.246 --> 25:50.082
LIL PAPI:
Speech. Speech. Speech.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.218
BOTH:
Speech! Speech! Speech!

25:52.251 --> 25:54.921
-Speech! Speech! Speech!
-Okay! Okay!

25:54.954 --> 25:58.024
Okay, all right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.392
I, uh, thank you all

26:00.426 --> 26:02.228
for throwing
this celebration for me.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.462
I, uh,

26:03.495 --> 26:05.397
I don't really feel
like I deserve it.

26:05.431 --> 26:06.733
Course you do, baby.
Come on.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.400
I mean, it's been a weird
couple of days.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.369
You know, there's been
a whole lot of endings,

26:10.402 --> 26:11.904
and maybe some new beginnings,

26:11.938 --> 26:13.272
-but, you know...
-ANGEL: Yes.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.441
-To new beginnings, honey.
-BLANCA: Uh, girl, could you

26:15.474 --> 26:17.109
-let him finish his speech?
-ANGEL: I wasn't interrupting.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.611
DAMON:
And, you know, I feel

26:18.645 --> 26:20.379
a renewed purpose, you know?

26:20.412 --> 26:23.549
With me finishing
my program, I...

26:23.582 --> 26:25.918
I'm gonna start being selfish
and focus on me.

26:25.952 --> 26:29.856
Mm. Start? (chuckles)

26:31.991 --> 26:33.292
Well, I learned from the best.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.762
You're welcome.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.430
Darling Angel,
you know I'm cleansing

26:38.464 --> 26:40.432
-the negativity out of my life.
-ANGEL (quietly): Very good.

26:40.466 --> 26:41.768
You keep it up,
you might be next.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.502
-Ooh.
-Mm.

26:43.535 --> 26:46.338
BLANCA:
Okay, well, good for you.
Good for you.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.074
Uh-- Let's not
carry around baggage.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.475
-Mm-hm.
-LIL PAPI: Hey, yo, Damon.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.310
What're you gonna do now that
you're done with school?

26:51.343 --> 26:54.747
I mean, you know...

26:54.781 --> 26:56.649
my degree is in dance, so,

26:56.683 --> 26:58.017
dance is the obvious choice.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.351
PRAY TELL:
As well it should be.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.253
That final performance
was stunning.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.521
Is there a future for a dancer?

27:03.355 --> 27:05.091
Yeah, if the...

27:05.124 --> 27:06.425
dancer works hard
and is talented.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.761
Oh... damn.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.496
So it'll be
a short-lived career.

27:10.529 --> 27:13.265
(laughing)

27:13.299 --> 27:15.334
No, you get it?

27:15.367 --> 27:18.805
-Well, it's definitely a longer
shelf life than a model's.
-(quietly): Damon?

27:18.838 --> 27:20.807
He's jealous because my face is
in every Duane Reade

27:20.840 --> 27:22.641
-in the city.
-Hm.

27:22.675 --> 27:25.678
People recognize me
when I go to Roy Rogers.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.213
Mm-hmm, is it because
of Wet and Wild,

27:27.246 --> 27:28.614
or is it because the piers?

27:28.647 --> 27:31.417
Mamma mia, babulote.
Damon got jokes.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.688
-So you're judging my survival?
-BLANCA: You know what?

27:35.722 --> 27:37.356
This was a fun little party.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.858
-Thank y'all for coming.
-Mm-hmm.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.659
-DAMON: No. No-no-no-no.
Uh, not that.
-Sit down.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.561
DAMON:
No. I mean,
you're degrading yourself

27:42.594 --> 27:43.896
perfectly fine without my help.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.898
-Well, fuck you, Damon.
-BLANCA: Angel, that's enough.

27:45.932 --> 27:48.467
Uh, I think I'm the only guy
in New York that hasn't.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.870
LIL PAPI:
Yo, bubba, ain't got to talk
to her like that.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.471
No, it's all right, baby.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.040
Let's see who has the last laugh

27:54.073 --> 27:55.474
when I'm traveling the world
and on magazine covers,

27:55.507 --> 27:58.711
and you're doing corny-ass,
stupid-ass tours...

27:58.745 --> 28:00.713
-BLANCA: Angel, all right,
cut it out.
-...of a, of a one-hit wonder.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.314
-Right?
-DAMON: I cannot wait
to see what kind...

28:02.348 --> 28:04.717
-Enough!
-...of campaigns you book
with that cracked skin.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.052
That's not
a natural glow, sweetie.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.386
That's cocaine sweats.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.723
BLANCA:
What are you talking about?

28:10.757 --> 28:12.424
You doing drugs?

28:13.425 --> 28:15.261
-No.
-She's lying.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.163
-Angel, I want the truth.
-Why would I jeopardize

28:17.196 --> 28:18.898
everything
I've worked so hard for?

28:18.931 --> 28:19.899
What were you doing
in the bathroom

28:19.932 --> 28:20.900
when I walked in on you
yesterday?

28:20.933 --> 28:22.501
I was doing my makeup.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.570
You know what? That is a serious
accusation, y'all.

28:24.603 --> 28:27.606
-(quietly): Okay.
-Well, wh-what do you need more?

28:27.639 --> 28:30.509
-I mean, we telling you
what we saw.
-Damon, there is no proof.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.444
We're telling the truth!
That-that should be enough!

28:32.478 --> 28:33.946
But it's not.
'Cause you a liar.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.414
You've been caught
lying already.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.117
-Remember? You was fucking Ricky
without a condom.
-Angel!

28:38.150 --> 28:40.119
-You forgot that quick? Huh?
-Angel! You know what, Papi?

28:40.152 --> 28:42.288
-Take her and go.
-You wasn't--

28:42.321 --> 28:43.622
You wasn't using condoms?

28:43.655 --> 28:45.524
Did you forget about that?

28:45.557 --> 28:46.558
DAMON:
You are always
sticking up for her,

28:46.592 --> 28:47.760
and I am sick of this shit,
okay?

28:47.794 --> 28:49.295
BLANCA:
Damon, you need to calm down.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.529
-No, I'm not gonna calm down!
-Who are you talking to?

28:50.562 --> 28:52.564
This is bullshit, okay?

28:52.598 --> 28:54.566
I am right behind you
all these years.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.969
I just asked you to back me up,
that's it. That's it!

28:57.003 --> 28:58.370
You're being
disrespectful, Damon.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.907
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.775
Whenever shit hits the fan,

29:02.809 --> 29:04.576
I'm the one behind your side.

29:04.610 --> 29:05.644
I'm the one
that's holding you down,

29:05.677 --> 29:07.279
-I'm showing up!
-Oh, and I haven't?

29:07.313 --> 29:09.448
I didn't encourage you
to go to dance school?

29:09.481 --> 29:12.318
Or start teaching down at the Y?

29:12.351 --> 29:13.886
You're my mother. That's what
you're supposed to do!

29:13.920 --> 29:15.087
Ever since you got
that nail salon,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.223
you've been all about yourself.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.625
-Now, who's the selfish
one now, huh?
-PRAY TELL: Okay!

29:19.658 --> 29:22.494
Enough. You will not talk
to your mother like that.

29:22.528 --> 29:23.896
Not in my presence.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.431
You have no idea

29:25.464 --> 29:26.999
the sacrifices
that have been made

29:27.033 --> 29:29.301
so that you can
"aspire to greatness."

29:29.335 --> 29:31.603
I can't wait for life
to hit you real hard,

29:31.637 --> 29:33.605
so that you have to experience

29:33.639 --> 29:36.142
how fucked up real life
really is.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.709
I know how fucked up
the world is.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.480
I was put out of my house
by my biological parents

29:41.513 --> 29:44.650
and then my ex-boyfriend
decided to expose me to HIV.

29:44.683 --> 29:45.517
What?

29:45.551 --> 29:47.954
DAMON:
Yeah.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.123
Ricky... is positive.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.658
Well, did you get tested?

29:52.691 --> 29:54.026
Oh, how's Ricky?

29:54.060 --> 29:55.962
-Is he okay?
-Well, I don't know.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.563
Ask Pray.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.835
-You knew?
-PRAY TELL: Okay.

30:02.869 --> 30:07.173
Okay, pump
the motherfucking brakes.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.675
Ricky came to me.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.710
And it's really shitty of you

30:11.743 --> 30:13.645
to share his status
with everybody.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.647
It's not your business!

30:15.681 --> 30:17.483
You need to learn
some damn respect!

30:17.516 --> 30:19.952
Agreed.
Who's raising these children?

30:19.986 --> 30:22.221
I need some Remy Martin
for this shit.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.291
Oh, you are one to talk about
some goddamn respect, Pray.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.692
-Excuse me?
-Yeah.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.160
Why don't you tell Blanca

30:28.194 --> 30:29.795
why you didn't tell her
about Ricky's status, huh?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.563
I didn't let her know
about his status

30:31.597 --> 30:33.632
because it's not my business

30:33.665 --> 30:34.967
-to tell!
-It's not because
you're fucking?

30:35.001 --> 30:36.668
Whoo!

30:36.702 --> 30:39.038
That's some new information.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.573
This house is scandalous,
can you believe this?

30:41.607 --> 30:45.311
You gonna believe him
if he denies it, too, huh? Huh?

30:45.344 --> 30:47.846
No...

30:47.880 --> 30:49.415
No, Pray would never do that.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.650
You gonna believe this slut
over your son!

30:51.683 --> 30:53.552
-PRAY TELL: I'm gonna
fuck you up!
-(Blanca shouting)

30:53.585 --> 30:55.687
I'm gonna fuck you up!
Who's a slut?

30:55.721 --> 30:57.689
Who's a fucking slut?

31:07.633 --> 31:11.670
Pray Tell... Pray.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.073
Is he telling the truth?

31:16.275 --> 31:17.509
Yeah.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.045
ELEKTRA:
Pray Tell,

31:19.078 --> 31:20.579
house mothers and fathers

31:20.612 --> 31:22.848
never sleep
with their children.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.117
It's the number one rule
in ballroom.

31:25.151 --> 31:28.454
-I'm not his father.
-But you're an elder!

31:28.487 --> 31:30.622
He looks up to you
like a father.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.724
All the boys in ballroom do.

31:32.758 --> 31:36.528
It's complicated.
Just like life.

31:36.562 --> 31:37.596
BLANCA:
Know what?
W-- You can get out.

31:37.629 --> 31:38.797
Are you for real?

31:38.830 --> 31:40.099
Yeah, I'm for real.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.633
-Please leave.
-Okay.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.569
You know what?

31:43.602 --> 31:47.739
Just so we're clear;
I'm a grown-ass man.

31:47.773 --> 31:51.810
Ricky is a grown-ass man!

31:52.911 --> 31:55.781
Whatever.
Fuck y'all.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.116
-Fuck you too, Pray.
-Yeah, remember that.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.751
ELEKTRA:
Laying down when you should be
standing up.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.153
Wake up!

32:17.169 --> 32:19.271
* Stop what you're doin'
'cause I'm about to ruin... *

32:19.305 --> 32:20.806
PRAY TELL:
Aw! Sookie sookie now!

32:20.839 --> 32:22.774
Sookie sookie sookie now!

32:22.808 --> 32:25.911
-(cheering)
-Shit, all right.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.614
Yo, Papi baby!

32:28.647 --> 32:30.182
-Judges, your score.
-* I'll drink a bottle
of Hennessey... *

32:30.216 --> 32:33.852
Ten! Ten! Ten! Ten! Ten, bitch!

32:33.885 --> 32:37.189
Give him a hand, way up high!

32:37.223 --> 32:41.293
-Papi Evangelista. Give it up!
-(cheering continues)

32:41.327 --> 32:42.728
Give it up!

32:44.530 --> 32:45.664
PRAY TELL:
Don't be mad.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.833
* Get up, come on and do... *

32:47.866 --> 32:48.867
PRAY TELL:
All right, let him have it.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.502
Let him have it.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.704
All right, now my next category
is my favorite.

32:52.738 --> 32:56.708
My favorite category.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.310
Femme Queen Vogue!

32:58.344 --> 33:02.148
-Come on. Come on, bitch.
-(crowd cheering)

33:02.181 --> 33:03.882
Ah! Come on, Charisma.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.717
Look, Ma, I got a trophy.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.719
PRAY TELL:
That's how I like it, too.

33:07.753 --> 33:08.954
Yeah, I see, baby. Congrats.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.722
Why you here by yourself?
Where's Damon at?

33:10.756 --> 33:12.324
Probably somewhere
twiddling his fingers

33:12.358 --> 33:13.825
telling stories on people.

33:13.859 --> 33:16.528
Mother, I know you mad at me.

33:16.562 --> 33:17.829
* We only take... *

33:17.863 --> 33:19.165
You believe him, don't you?

33:19.198 --> 33:22.368
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

33:22.401 --> 33:23.902
You says you wasn't
messing around

33:23.935 --> 33:26.638
with that stuff,
so I'll let it go, baby.

33:26.672 --> 33:27.706
PRAY TELL:
All right, come on, Florida.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.208
We see you.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.043
Fringing.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.711
In all that neon, baby.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.846
We see you. Work it out.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.348
Work it out. (laughs)

33:36.382 --> 33:39.385
I must have missed the memo that
we were having a family meeting.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.687
-What y'all talking about?
-I got a trophy.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.056
Oh, swirl it around
like a windmill.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.491
Pop, pop. Pop-pop.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.193
Pop. Pop!

33:47.226 --> 33:49.495
-(crowd cheering)
-Oh, shit.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.430
Here comes Silhouette
from the rear, baby.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.732
Whirling,
swirling, swishing,

33:53.765 --> 33:56.868
swirling like a windmill. Yes!

33:56.902 --> 34:00.072
And the whip--
Whip it good, bitch. Whip it.

34:00.106 --> 34:02.174
-Serving up twists...
-So have you told Mother

34:02.208 --> 34:03.242
-the truth yet?
-BLANCA: She did.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.043
And when's she moving out?

34:05.077 --> 34:06.178
I ain't going nowhere.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.746
-(laughing)
-PRAY TELL: Pop, pop.

34:07.779 --> 34:08.947
Oh!

34:08.980 --> 34:10.048
Yes!

34:10.082 --> 34:11.283
DAMON:
Oh, I see.

34:11.317 --> 34:14.853
Mother holds you
to a different standard.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.722
Papi sells weed to get by,

34:16.755 --> 34:17.956
and he's homeless instantly,
and...

34:17.989 --> 34:20.058
But dear, old, darling

34:20.092 --> 34:21.793
Miss Angel does hardcore,

34:21.827 --> 34:23.295
lethal drugs
and she gets to stay.

34:23.329 --> 34:24.763
-What is up with that?
-Damon, stop.

34:24.796 --> 34:27.899
She said she didn't do it,
so let it be.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.401
PRAY TELL:
Ten, ten, ten, ten,

34:29.435 --> 34:31.637
-ten.
-You calling me a,
a liar, Mother?

34:31.670 --> 34:34.606
PRAY TELL:
...time for the next category!

34:34.640 --> 34:37.109
Butch Queen Vogue!

34:37.143 --> 34:39.578
(crowd whistling, whooping)

34:42.748 --> 34:44.650
Hmm.

34:44.683 --> 34:47.919
Come on, Shadow.
From the rear.

34:47.953 --> 34:49.321
Shadow from the rear.

34:49.355 --> 34:51.723
-I got to go.
-Yeah, go.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.759
* It takes two to make it
out of sight... *

34:53.792 --> 34:56.295
PRAY TELL:
Oh, oh. Here comes Damon

34:56.328 --> 34:57.996
from the rear.

34:58.029 --> 35:01.667
Serving us, serving us
the banjee, oh!

35:01.700 --> 35:04.069
He's giving you loins, baby.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.772
Ooh, that face.
That face is mad.

35:06.805 --> 35:10.242
That face is mad.
Hey, what's going on, honey?

35:10.276 --> 35:12.978
Damon's like, "Get out of my
way, get out my way, bitch.

35:13.011 --> 35:14.780
Get out my way."
Come on, Damon.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.648
Work that shit out. Uh.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.518
What? Push.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.320
In the push. Get out the way.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.522
Push, push, get out the way.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.824
Move, move. Get out the-- wow!

35:25.857 --> 35:27.959
Ow.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.661
* I don't know, so let's go *

35:29.695 --> 35:32.331
Yoga planting.
Holds himself up.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.799
That core is strong, bitch.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.534
That core is strong.

35:36.868 --> 35:40.105
* It takes two to make it
out of sight *

35:40.138 --> 35:43.008
* It takes two to make
a thing go right... *

35:45.311 --> 35:47.746
You got to come on in here
with the goods, baby.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.284
Giving us backstroke realness.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.885
* 'Cause I'm gonna
keep you in step *

35:53.919 --> 35:54.986
* I got an idea... *

35:55.020 --> 35:56.855
PRAY TELL:
Oh. What?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.724
What, you don't want it?

35:58.757 --> 35:59.858
You don't want it.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.793
You don't want it, queen.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.895
You don't want it.
(laughing)

36:03.929 --> 36:05.397
Okay, stop, stop.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.199
Stop, bitch. Stop.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.701
Come on up
and get these trophies.

36:09.735 --> 36:13.038
All right. Cut the music,
cut the music.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.541
This first score
goes to Chardonnay.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.909
Chardonnay Pendavis,
what are your scores? Eight,

36:17.943 --> 36:19.911
nine, eight, nine, eight.

36:19.945 --> 36:21.547
All right.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.981
For Shadow, baby.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.584
-Wintour.
-We know where you from, bitch.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.985
Shadow Wintour.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.855
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Let's go, Shadow!

36:29.888 --> 36:30.989
Ten, nine, nine, ten,

36:31.022 --> 36:32.758
ten-- You know.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.060
There is room, honey.

36:35.093 --> 36:38.196
There is room at the end.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.333
Who's next?
Is it Damon Evangelista?

36:41.367 --> 36:43.034
-CROWD: Evangelista.
-PRAY TELL: Oh.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.072
That bitch said,
"Move out my way.

36:47.105 --> 36:50.041
I got things to do." Oh, for

36:50.075 --> 36:51.209
Damon Evangelista...

36:51.243 --> 36:53.211
Ten, ten, ten,

36:53.245 --> 36:55.013
ten, ten.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.047
Ten, ten, ten,

36:56.081 --> 36:58.250
across the motherfucking board.

36:58.284 --> 37:01.019
Come on and get this trophy.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.855
You earned it, you deserve it.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.024
God bless you.
Give me a smile, bitch.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.926
I know you didn't
roll your eyes at me.

37:07.959 --> 37:11.096
Don't make me have to knock them
eyes out your head, bitch.

37:11.129 --> 37:12.431
You ain't grown yet.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.032
* Get busy, you ready now? *

37:14.065 --> 37:15.701
* One, two... *

37:15.734 --> 37:17.235
PRAY TELL:
Shit. I need a ciggie break.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.037
Come on, Jack Mizrahi.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.907
Take over for me
for a minute, baby.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.080
Hi. Damon, right?

37:29.114 --> 37:30.916
Yeah. (chuckles)

37:30.949 --> 37:32.784
I saw you perform

37:32.818 --> 37:35.220
and I had to introduce myself.
My name is Tori.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.656
(inhales sharply)

37:37.689 --> 37:40.091
I work closely
with Malcolm McLaren.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.794
Can we talk?

37:42.828 --> 37:44.330
(softly):
Oh...

37:49.868 --> 37:51.870
Pray Tell, we need to have
a discussion.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.307
I'm down from one pack
of cigarettes a day

37:55.341 --> 37:57.275
to two a week; I don't want
to hear your mouth.

37:57.309 --> 38:00.312
Do not be a mean queen,
you know what I'm talking about.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.481
Okay.

38:02.514 --> 38:05.283
Let me break it down for you.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.319
You have different rules
for different people.

38:07.353 --> 38:08.920
-What did you say?
-I said,

38:08.954 --> 38:10.689
you have different rules
for different people.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.758
Just like you rank and file
your children

38:12.791 --> 38:14.693
-and treat them accordingly.
-I treat all

38:14.726 --> 38:17.128
of my children the same.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.164
-You are in denial.
-Pray Tell, I'm not

38:19.197 --> 38:22.133
an unfair mother.
And I do not play favorites.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.135
Angel.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.871
She gets to do drugs and stay.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.473
When other people
get kicked out.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.675
-That is not true.
-(derisive laugh)

38:29.708 --> 38:31.176
Damon sleeps with Ricky,

38:31.209 --> 38:32.644
even though that's
against your rules

38:32.678 --> 38:34.946
and now you're mad at me
for doing the same thing.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.982
Will you stop
flapping your gums

38:37.015 --> 38:39.117
for a minute and hear me out?

38:39.150 --> 38:41.219
Damn, I'm-a give you the hard
truth, Pray Tell.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.355
Straight up.
You are taking advantage

38:43.389 --> 38:45.023
of someone who is in
a very vulnerable

38:45.056 --> 38:48.727
-position right now.
-He... came on to me.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.028
You of all people

38:50.061 --> 38:52.063
should understand why
I didn't stop him.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.500
I'm 45 years old, here's a man.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.702
Who shows me kindness.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.470
Who thinks I'm sexy.

38:58.504 --> 39:01.006
That doesn't happen
to me every day.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.208
You two are not equals.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.911
That boy doesn't even know
who he is yet.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.313
And on top of things,
he just found out

39:08.346 --> 39:10.081
he's HIV positive.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.083
His head is probably
on another planet right now.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.352
I'm-a say this one more time.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.988
Ricky's grown.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.758
-And he's doing just fine.
-How is Ricky fine?

39:19.791 --> 39:21.993
I've known about my status
for a whole two years

39:22.027 --> 39:24.896
and I still don't know how to
navigate sex and relationships.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.198
Maybe that's your problem.
You...

39:27.232 --> 39:28.934
let your sex dry up
because of this virus

39:28.967 --> 39:31.202
and now you're jealous
of me because

39:31.236 --> 39:33.238
-I haven't done the same.
-Know what?

39:33.271 --> 39:35.273
Fuck that, Pray.

39:35.306 --> 39:39.545
You have no idea what it is like
to be a woman

39:39.578 --> 39:42.514
living with HIV.
At least when you're gay,

39:42.548 --> 39:44.850
y'all can live
in the same war zone.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.084
Y'all can protect each other.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.086
Straight men still think
that they can catch

39:48.119 --> 39:50.221
this virus from a spoon.

39:50.255 --> 39:51.923
They want nothing to do with me.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.091
That's no excuse...

39:53.124 --> 39:55.126
-for you to stop trying.
-Don't you dare

39:55.160 --> 39:58.063
act like you know what
it's like to, to be me.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.300
-You know what?
Get out of my face.
-Oh, so you own

40:02.333 --> 40:04.636
-the motherfucking streets
of New York now?
-You damn--

40:04.670 --> 40:06.171
You damn right. Come correct.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.983
One last thing.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.418
And I hope you hear me.

40:20.452 --> 40:23.121
I never meant to hurt anyone.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.657
(voice breaking):
Most of all, you.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.998
(heavy sigh)

40:33.031 --> 40:35.033
(distant laughter)

40:36.034 --> 40:38.470
Oh, ow. Turn that off.

40:38.504 --> 40:40.305
Turn that off, it's too bright.

40:40.338 --> 40:41.673
(lock clicks)

40:41.707 --> 40:44.476
Rough night?

40:47.212 --> 40:48.647
Is that a question?

40:50.882 --> 40:52.350
(Ricky grunting)

40:52.383 --> 40:54.252
Uh...

40:54.285 --> 40:57.322
you shouldn't be drinking.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.491
Let me tell you something.
If you gon' spend time

40:59.525 --> 41:03.161
in my house, you will not
tell me what to do.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.696
Okay.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.364
-You ain't the boss of me.
-Okay, okay.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.166
Okay. Calm down.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.704
I'm a black gay man...

41:12.738 --> 41:15.273
who's dying...

41:15.306 --> 41:17.509
of HIV.

41:17.543 --> 41:19.811
I'm just trying to figure out

41:19.845 --> 41:21.847
how to live when I...

41:24.315 --> 41:26.351
Everybody in the world
wants me dead.

41:28.353 --> 41:31.957
Hmm, the only person in
the world who understood that

41:31.990 --> 41:35.326
was Blanca and I blew
that friendship up...

41:35.360 --> 41:37.629
for a player...

41:37.663 --> 41:40.031
who's gonna break my heart.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.067
I didn't ask you to defend me.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.234
Bullshit.

41:43.268 --> 41:46.304
-Bullshit.
-Um...

41:46.337 --> 41:48.406
okay.

41:48.439 --> 41:51.910
Blanca was your mother
and you came to me.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.349
Who do I go to now for support?

41:58.383 --> 42:01.519
With my fears? Who? Who? Who?

42:04.590 --> 42:07.358
Who... (sniffles)

42:07.392 --> 42:09.394
Who's my mother now?

42:11.529 --> 42:14.365
-(Pray Tell groaning)
-Come here.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.401
(groans)

42:19.270 --> 42:21.406
-(groans)
-You need to get up, okay?

42:21.439 --> 42:23.541
Mm-hmm.

42:23.575 --> 42:25.010
-Come on. One...
-(Pray groaning)

42:25.043 --> 42:28.213
...two, three.
Oh, I got you.

42:28.246 --> 42:31.382
Here we go.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.351
Yeah. You made it.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.553
-I really did.
-I told you...

42:35.587 --> 42:37.422
-Mm-hmm.
-...you would make it.

42:37.455 --> 42:40.558
Get these off.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.327
-Feel better?
-Mm-hmm.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.899
(Pray Tell sighs heavily)

42:47.933 --> 42:51.436
Sleep this off and we'll talk
about it in the morning.

42:53.504 --> 42:55.506
I know you.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.777
You'll be gone.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.782
And I'll be all alone.

43:03.815 --> 43:06.584
Just like...

43:06.618 --> 43:08.453
all the others.

43:16.762 --> 43:19.430
(sighs)

43:19.464 --> 43:21.466
(birds singing)

43:23.368 --> 43:25.370
(groans)

43:27.205 --> 43:29.207
Oh...

43:33.611 --> 43:35.781
(groans)

43:35.814 --> 43:38.316
Good morning.

43:38.349 --> 43:40.786
I made you some coffee.

43:40.819 --> 43:43.354
It'll help with that hangover
I'm sure you got.

43:55.466 --> 43:58.469
I hope you hungry.
There's a lot of food here.

43:58.503 --> 44:01.572
Some coffee.

44:06.244 --> 44:08.246
Take a couple of these.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.118
What?

44:13.151 --> 44:15.887
(chuckles)

44:15.921 --> 44:17.689
You're still here.

44:17.723 --> 44:19.725
(sighs)

44:43.348 --> 44:45.383
I'm so sorry I'm late.

44:45.416 --> 44:48.720
-I got you your favorite.
-Ooh.

44:48.754 --> 44:52.257
-Mmm, and they crispy, too.
-Mm-hmm.

44:52.290 --> 44:53.524
How was your day?

44:53.558 --> 44:56.327
-It was good.
-Yeah?

44:56.361 --> 44:58.696
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Good.

44:58.730 --> 45:00.398
I'm still on cloud nine
about Damon's graduation.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.868
I can't believe one of our own
got a degree.

45:02.901 --> 45:05.436
Everything is changing
for the better. (chuckles)

45:10.475 --> 45:11.843
-Mother.
-Mm-hmm?

45:11.877 --> 45:13.879
Everything coming up
ain't roses.

45:13.912 --> 45:15.914
What are you talking about?

45:15.947 --> 45:18.884
Me and Damon, Damon and Ricky,

45:18.917 --> 45:22.420
you and Damon,
and now you and Pray Tell.

45:22.453 --> 45:24.422
That's a lot of drama,

45:24.455 --> 45:26.624
even for ballroom.

45:26.657 --> 45:28.894
Hey, those are just bumps
in the road. Families fight.

45:28.927 --> 45:30.528
It'll be okay, you'll see.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.964
-I know how much
you love Pray Tell.
-Girl... (scoffs)

45:32.998 --> 45:36.301
I got other things to
concentrate on than wondering

45:36.334 --> 45:38.636
about what ballroom trade Pray
Tell is bringing in this week.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.371
That's mad shady.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.540
You know Pray Tell
not like that.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.175
It's not our job to judge.

45:49.114 --> 45:50.581
Hm, I guess you're right.

45:50.615 --> 45:52.918
Mm-hmm.

45:52.951 --> 45:55.553
-I was kind of hard on him.
-Yeah, you was.

45:55.586 --> 45:58.589
And you wasn't
hard on me at all.

46:00.625 --> 46:02.393
What?

46:02.427 --> 46:03.628
Damon.

46:05.663 --> 46:07.565
He wasn't lying.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.634
See, I knew it. I knew it.

46:09.667 --> 46:11.502
I thought that Papi
was good for you,

46:11.536 --> 46:13.338
and he wasn't. He was
supposed to keep you focused,

46:13.371 --> 46:14.472
and he pressured you
into doing drugs.

46:14.505 --> 46:16.507
It's not-- That's not Papi.

46:16.541 --> 46:19.610
Stop blaming everybody.
I did it.

46:19.644 --> 46:21.179
I chose to do it.

46:21.212 --> 46:24.615
You want to be mad at somebody,
be mad at me. Blame me.

46:24.649 --> 46:29.020
You taught me to be a woman of
my word, a woman of integrity.

46:29.054 --> 46:32.623
I broke the rules.

46:32.657 --> 46:36.527
I have to accept
the consequences.

46:40.165 --> 46:41.632
Go ahead.

46:41.666 --> 46:43.634
Do it.

46:43.668 --> 46:46.371
You have to.

46:46.404 --> 46:48.039
Kick me out.

46:48.073 --> 46:50.341
No. I'm not doing that.
You my only daughter.

46:50.375 --> 46:51.609
I can't do that.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.980
So what? Rules are rules.

46:55.013 --> 46:57.849
I'm not gonna let you stop being
a good mother because of me.

46:59.851 --> 47:02.587
(sighs)

47:08.226 --> 47:10.028
Maybe it'll be easier
if you think about it

47:10.061 --> 47:13.398
like a graduation. Right?

47:13.431 --> 47:15.000
Like Damon.

47:15.033 --> 47:18.169
-(scoffs)
-From a daughter in your house

47:18.203 --> 47:21.672
to a woman on my own.

47:21.706 --> 47:24.976
-Right?
-Yeah.

47:25.010 --> 47:28.746
-Where you gonna go?
-You know, Papi?

47:28.779 --> 47:31.416
He found the perfect place.

47:31.449 --> 47:33.651
Right in the heart
of the Village.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.753
We'll take care of each other,
just like you taught us.

47:35.786 --> 47:37.822
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

47:37.855 --> 47:41.092
Maybe you come over
for Friday night dinners.

47:41.126 --> 47:43.228
Yeah.

47:45.030 --> 47:46.797
(kisses)

48:07.818 --> 48:11.522
As much as I fought with y'all
about cleaning y'all room,

48:11.556 --> 48:13.758
I'm glad to see you finally know
how to do it on your own.

48:13.791 --> 48:15.793
(chuckles)

48:19.564 --> 48:20.932
All right, look,

48:20.966 --> 48:23.101
how long is the silent treatment
gonna last?

48:25.971 --> 48:29.074
I saw Angel today.
She told me the truth.

48:29.107 --> 48:32.310
Sorry I didn't believe you.
Mothers make mistakes, too.

48:37.148 --> 48:38.649
I have some news.

48:43.688 --> 48:46.057
Do you know, um,

48:46.091 --> 48:48.826
-who Malcolm McLaren is?
-Uh...

48:48.859 --> 48:51.329
That artist who does

48:51.362 --> 48:53.098
-"Deep In Vogue"?
-Yeah.

48:53.131 --> 48:56.901
There was a lady at the ball
that worked for him.

48:56.934 --> 48:59.504
Said that he's about to start
his tour for his new album,

48:59.537 --> 49:01.806
and... he wants me to join him.

49:01.839 --> 49:03.108
Oh, my God.

49:03.141 --> 49:05.643
-Damon, that is great.
-In Europe.

49:08.713 --> 49:09.947
Europe?

49:09.981 --> 49:12.950
Yeah. Said that we start
in a week.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.963
-How long you gonna
be there for?
-I don't know.

49:25.997 --> 49:29.667
A year. Maybe longer.

49:29.700 --> 49:33.771
Wow.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.707
My son the ambassador.

49:36.741 --> 49:39.444
I am so proud of you,

49:39.477 --> 49:41.579
and I am gonna miss you.

49:43.814 --> 49:46.617
I don't... I don't think
I can do it.

49:46.651 --> 49:48.819
(chuckles)

49:48.853 --> 49:52.857
You know, I always knew
this day would come.

49:52.890 --> 49:55.860
Where I would have to share you
with the world.

49:59.664 --> 50:00.731
And to be quite honest,

50:00.765 --> 50:02.200
I would keep you here forever
if I could,

50:02.233 --> 50:04.969
but you got a talent
and the world needs to see that.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.971
This is what you've spent

50:07.004 --> 50:08.873
the last years working towards.

50:08.906 --> 50:11.842
All the sacrifices you made
to get here.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.778
You can't give up
on that dream now.

50:15.413 --> 50:19.250
How many of us get the
opportunity to do what we love?

50:21.018 --> 50:22.887
But I can't leave you.

50:22.920 --> 50:25.156
I'll always be with you.

50:25.190 --> 50:26.691
Right here.

50:30.395 --> 50:32.863
(softly):
Bring it in.

50:32.897 --> 50:34.665
(kisses)

50:34.699 --> 50:36.000
DOMINATRIX:
Do you have an extra pair

50:36.033 --> 50:37.868
of nipple clamps I can borrow?

50:37.902 --> 50:40.071
What do I look like to you,
Rent-A-Center?

50:42.073 --> 50:44.675
I still can't believe
you're making money off of

50:44.709 --> 50:45.776
hurting people.

50:45.810 --> 50:48.179
Life is pain.

50:48.213 --> 50:50.948
In here, we all understand
that in order to enjoy it,

50:50.981 --> 50:52.783
you have to embrace it.

50:52.817 --> 50:55.620
But the pain I'm feeling
towards my children leaving,

50:55.653 --> 50:58.456
I...

50:58.489 --> 51:01.592
I don't know how I'm supposed to
embrace something like that.

51:01.626 --> 51:04.962
If they don't grow strong enough
to rebel,

51:04.995 --> 51:08.065
to reject you, to move away,

51:08.099 --> 51:10.768
then you're not raising
men and women.

51:10.801 --> 51:13.438
-You're creating parasites.
-So that's it?

51:15.840 --> 51:18.876
I give them everything
and they're just gone?

51:18.909 --> 51:20.978
There are always
more children to raise.

51:21.011 --> 51:22.947
Not like these kids.

51:22.980 --> 51:24.115
(chuckles)

51:25.816 --> 51:27.785
(sighs) Listen.

51:27.818 --> 51:29.787
I don't care if you're

51:29.820 --> 51:32.657
a Connecticut white girl,
a Chinatown immigrant,

51:32.690 --> 51:34.825
or one of us.

51:34.859 --> 51:38.896
If you choose to be a mother,
you choose to shape the world.

51:38.929 --> 51:42.800
Your children
will truly appreciate you

51:42.833 --> 51:44.502
when you're dead.

51:44.535 --> 51:46.571
Until then,

51:46.604 --> 51:49.474
you want gratitude?
Get a puppy.

51:49.507 --> 51:51.476
* I had it all *

51:51.509 --> 51:56.314
* But I let it slip away... *

51:57.882 --> 52:00.117

I treated you wrong... *

52:00.151 --> 52:01.919
That's enough.

52:01.952 --> 52:04.455
Mother has to go to work now.

52:04.489 --> 52:07.124
* Now I wander around *

52:07.158 --> 52:10.027
* Feeling down and cold... *

52:10.060 --> 52:11.862
You'll be fine.

52:11.896 --> 52:14.832
Jim, heel.

52:14.865 --> 52:19.170
* Trying to believe
that you're gone *

52:19.204 --> 52:22.607

52:22.640 --> 52:25.843
* To heal when you're
hurting so much *

52:25.876 --> 52:29.880

that I was blind *

52:29.914 --> 52:32.883
* To let you go *

52:32.917 --> 52:36.387

52:36.421 --> 52:38.956
* Inside *

52:38.989 --> 52:42.993
* 'Cause love takes time *

52:43.027 --> 52:45.796
* I don't want to be here *

52:45.830 --> 52:49.133
* I don't want
to be here *

52:49.166 --> 52:52.403
* Alone *

52:52.437 --> 52:54.439
* Ooh *

52:58.108 --> 53:00.378
* Losing my mind *

53:00.411 --> 53:03.881
* From this hollow in my heart *

53:05.550 --> 53:08.419
* Suddenly I'm so *

53:08.453 --> 53:12.723
* Incomplete *

53:12.757 --> 53:15.760
* Lord, I'm needing you now *

53:15.793 --> 53:20.731
* Tell me how to stop the rain *

53:20.765 --> 53:23.368
* Tears are falling down *

53:23.401 --> 53:25.670
* Endlessly *

53:25.703 --> 53:27.872
* Whoa *

53:27.905 --> 53:31.041

53:31.075 --> 53:34.211

hurting so much *

53:34.245 --> 53:38.849
