WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.869
BERLUTI: Previously
on The Practice.

00:02.903 --> 00:04.738
I would like to explore
murder two.

00:04.771 --> 00:05.872
That is a life sentence.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.040
FRUTT: I don't know
what to tell you.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.942
We are going to lose here.

00:08.975 --> 00:09.876
We are dead.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.645
EMMA: Daddy, let me tell.
Emma.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.914
FRUTT: We need to know
the truth.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.882
Did you poison your mother?

00:15.916 --> 00:18.084
(sobs) She was ruining
everything.

00:18.118 --> 00:20.453
WEST: The charges
against Bradley Stanfield

00:20.486 --> 00:21.321
are dismissed.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.488
I killed Molly.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.890
As the case went south,

00:23.924 --> 00:25.425
Emma and I devised
a backup plan,

00:25.458 --> 00:27.427
getting you to think
that she did it.

00:27.460 --> 00:30.130
FRUTT: How do I let
a 10-year-old girl

00:30.163 --> 00:31.598
spend her life

00:31.632 --> 00:32.766
in juvenile hall?

00:32.799 --> 00:34.434
I know about the little plan,

00:34.467 --> 00:36.803
and may I say I admire you?

00:36.837 --> 00:39.172
But now, we have to get
our statements exactly right

00:39.205 --> 00:41.307
to protect you both
against perjury.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.609
CAMPBELL:
Did you trick this girl?

00:42.643 --> 00:43.744
SHORE: I might have used
a little trickery.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.111
This would be privileged.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.312
Since Mr. Stanfield

00:46.346 --> 00:48.682
accomplished his mistrial
through fraud,

00:48.715 --> 00:50.050
double jeopardy does not attach.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.586
WOMAN (over TV): Brad Stanfield
has been rearrested

00:52.619 --> 00:55.355
for the murder of his wife
and unborn son.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.457
I don't believe you had nothing
to do with this, Ellenor.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.660
I'm in here now,
but I won't be for long.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.235
We're in each other's lives,
Ellenor.

01:03.469 --> 01:04.905
You're not being treated
by anybody?

01:04.938 --> 01:05.772
CARLISLE: Why should I be,

01:05.806 --> 01:07.541
because God speaks to me?

01:07.574 --> 01:09.142
Did you hire her?
SHORE: I've got to keep

01:09.175 --> 01:10.276
this woman close to me

01:10.310 --> 01:12.879
until I can persuade her
to get back on her medication.

01:12.913 --> 01:13.980
WILSON:
So, she works here?

01:14.014 --> 01:15.682
She will not draw salary,

01:15.716 --> 01:16.883
and most importantly,

01:16.917 --> 01:19.119
we are not to give her clients,

01:19.152 --> 01:20.854
ever.
WILSON: Massachusetts

01:20.887 --> 01:21.955
is a no-fault state.

01:21.988 --> 01:23.890
Your wife's infidelity
is a nonissue.

01:23.924 --> 01:26.459
She didn't just cheat on me,
Ms. Wilson.

01:26.492 --> 01:28.529
She did so
with my best friend.

01:28.562 --> 01:30.030
I have two young kids.

01:30.063 --> 01:31.397
I'll represent you, Roland.

01:31.431 --> 01:32.733
Sheila.
And I don't think

01:32.766 --> 01:33.767
we should just file claim

01:33.800 --> 01:35.468
against her.
Sheila!

01:35.502 --> 01:36.737
NANCY: Little news flash,

01:36.770 --> 01:38.338
the kids aren't yours,

01:38.371 --> 01:39.005
they're Richard's.

01:39.039 --> 01:40.541
Nancy.
What?

01:40.574 --> 01:41.508
NANCY: So drop this case,

01:41.542 --> 01:43.243
or you'll never see them again.

01:43.276 --> 01:44.377
I wanna hurt her now.

01:44.410 --> 01:46.246
We're gonna try to get you
full custody.

01:46.279 --> 01:47.347
Promise me that.

01:47.380 --> 01:48.715
I promise, Roland.

01:49.149 --> 01:51.117
(door bell dings)

01:51.151 --> 01:51.852
Roland.

01:51.885 --> 01:53.386
I think I need a lawyer.

01:55.421 --> 01:57.858
(gasps)

01:57.891 --> 02:00.333
Holy Mary, mother of God.

02:03.236 --> 02:06.640
(music playing)

02:06.673 --> 02:09.610
(indistinct chatter)

02:14.981 --> 02:16.382
You found them like that?

02:17.617 --> 02:19.152
What do you mean?

02:19.185 --> 02:21.187
Certainly, you don't think
that I did it.

02:22.388 --> 02:23.223
Ms. Wilson,

02:23.256 --> 02:24.958
when you entered this room...

02:26.426 --> 02:28.662
They were...

02:28.695 --> 02:29.963
like that.

02:29.996 --> 02:31.932
(camera shutter clicks)

02:33.499 --> 02:36.469
Oh, gracious Lord,
we beseech you,

02:36.503 --> 02:39.139
remember not against them
the sins of their youth

02:39.172 --> 02:41.207
and of their ignorances.

02:42.108 --> 02:43.409
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

02:43.443 --> 02:44.711
hallowed be thy name.

02:45.111 --> 02:46.346
The police want
to talk to him,

02:46.379 --> 02:47.914
which I haven't allowed.

02:48.515 --> 02:51.084
He's in a bit of a daze, Eugene,

02:51.117 --> 02:52.285
and so is Sheila,
for that matter.

02:52.318 --> 02:53.620
I mean, I really don't know
what to do.

02:54.521 --> 02:55.822
YOUNG: I'm almost there.

02:55.856 --> 02:58.559
Do not let him speak to anybody.

02:58.592 --> 03:00.433
Stay in the den till I arrive.

03:00.466 --> 03:02.302
Well, I think we need
to get him to a doctor.

03:03.537 --> 03:06.472
Well, actually,
maybe both of them.

03:06.507 --> 03:08.041
YOUNG (over phone): Stay there.

03:08.074 --> 03:09.009
Okay.

03:13.279 --> 03:14.748
(phone beeps)
(sighs)

03:17.718 --> 03:18.852
Roland,

03:19.686 --> 03:20.787
look at me.

03:21.688 --> 03:22.789
In a moment,

03:22.823 --> 03:23.990
Eugene Young will be here,

03:24.024 --> 03:26.226
and he is very good
at this sort of thing.

03:26.259 --> 03:27.528
Blessed are those--
I don't wanna go to jail.

03:27.961 --> 03:29.262
I can appreciate that.

03:29.730 --> 03:31.565
This is wrong, Tara.

03:31.598 --> 03:32.833
I called you here to help me,

03:32.866 --> 03:34.267
and you called the police.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.102
That's not
what I asked you to do.

03:36.136 --> 03:38.972
WILSON: Roland,
you shot two people.

03:39.005 --> 03:40.541
I don't wanna go to jail.

03:41.407 --> 03:42.375
A little help?

03:42.408 --> 03:44.310
Blessed are those
who are persecuted

03:44.344 --> 03:45.445
for the sake
of righteousness,

03:45.478 --> 03:47.147
for theirs
is the kingdom of heaven.

03:47.180 --> 03:48.782
Blessed are they who hunger.

03:48.815 --> 03:50.150
I don't wanna go to jail.

03:50.183 --> 03:52.085
Now I lay me down to sleep.

03:52.118 --> 03:53.654
I don't wanna go to jail.

03:53.687 --> 03:55.722
Jail, jail, jail, jail.

03:57.290 --> 03:58.659
Excellent.

03:58.992 --> 04:03.837
(music playing)

04:41.441 --> 04:42.275
SHORE: Crazy how?

04:42.308 --> 04:43.343
WILSON: Mumbling prayers.

04:43.376 --> 04:45.411
She seemed totally
out of it, Alan.

04:45.445 --> 04:47.714
Eugene wants us in.

04:47.748 --> 04:49.349
Let's keep this
between us, okay?

04:49.382 --> 04:50.884
Well, too late,
because Eugene witnessed

04:50.917 --> 04:52.719
some of it
when he got there.

04:52.753 --> 04:53.987
Splendid.

04:54.655 --> 04:56.757
YOUNG: Okay, we got Roland
Huff's arraignment at 10:00.

04:57.524 --> 04:58.892
I'll take that.

04:58.925 --> 05:01.768
Tara, since you seem to have
some dialogue with the man,

05:01.802 --> 05:02.936
maybe you should come with me.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.306
In regard to Jeanette Martin,
what's that?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.074
Mine.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.576
My cousin.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.276
She's a nun,

05:11.211 --> 05:14.014
suing her parish
for wrongful termination.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.048
I said I'd help.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.116
Why'd they fire her?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.151
She's pregnant.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.286
It's a dog, I know.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.287
YOUNG: Reminder,

05:21.321 --> 05:23.389
decisions on whether
we take cases or not

05:23.423 --> 05:25.559
are to be run through me.
I'll get rid of it.

05:32.198 --> 05:32.999
You all right?

05:33.767 --> 05:34.535
Fine.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.335
Thank you for asking.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.605
Client's blasted two people
last night.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.506
Perhaps you heard?

05:40.106 --> 05:41.808
Yes, we spoke after.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.110
You really okay?

05:44.144 --> 05:45.846
I'm fine.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.347
In criminal law,
clients turn out

05:47.380 --> 05:48.782
to be criminals on occasion.

05:48.815 --> 05:49.983
Funny thing.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.251
YOUNG: Alan,

05:52.118 --> 05:53.654
maybe you and I need
to get together

05:53.687 --> 05:55.155
after this and--
Boom!

05:59.359 --> 06:01.134
Well, I mean, I wasn't there
when the shooting happened,

06:01.167 --> 06:03.369
you know, but I imagine
it sounded something like that.

06:03.403 --> 06:05.639
Boom! Right in the chest.

06:05.672 --> 06:08.609
(music playing)

06:16.850 --> 06:18.685
We can't let her practice.

06:18.719 --> 06:20.821
Work is her best conduit
to sanity.

06:20.854 --> 06:23.056
She's in there going "Boom."

06:23.657 --> 06:25.291
She's committed no malpractice.

06:25.325 --> 06:26.392
FRUTT: Alan,

06:26.426 --> 06:28.328
we can't wait
for that to happen.

06:28.361 --> 06:29.596
Don't give her cases,

06:29.630 --> 06:31.197
but please,

06:31.231 --> 06:32.666
don't take her job away,

06:32.699 --> 06:34.768
especially since this--

06:34.801 --> 06:35.736
She just left.

06:35.769 --> 06:37.170
Who?
WILSON: Sheila,

06:37.203 --> 06:38.672
to cover Roland's arraignment.

06:38.705 --> 06:39.840
Oh, come on.

06:44.778 --> 06:46.346
MARTIN: One tiny
little mistake.

06:46.379 --> 06:47.714
Jimmy.

06:52.619 --> 06:54.154
WILSON: Uh, could you
cover the phones

06:54.187 --> 06:54.921
until I get back?

06:56.156 --> 06:57.490
Can I cover the phones?

06:57.524 --> 06:58.692
Do I look like an assistant?

06:59.192 --> 07:00.466
That was hostile.

07:04.738 --> 07:05.405
Ellenor.

07:06.807 --> 07:07.874
Hey, Walter.

07:07.908 --> 07:09.676
Got a minute?
FRUTT: Sure.

07:12.212 --> 07:12.913
What's up?

07:14.447 --> 07:16.182
I now represent
Brad Stanfield.

07:17.684 --> 07:18.384
Excuse me?

07:18.418 --> 07:20.053
He just retained me.

07:20.086 --> 07:21.822
FRUTT: Wow.
I'm surprised

07:21.855 --> 07:23.323
he could afford you.

07:23.356 --> 07:25.792
PYNE: Well,
I asked for the case.

07:26.326 --> 07:27.928
What Alan Shore did here

07:27.961 --> 07:29.763
was unconscionable,
and I know

07:29.796 --> 07:31.497
you share that view,

07:31.532 --> 07:33.767
which is why I've come
to ask you to join me.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.201
Join you in...

07:35.235 --> 07:36.770
PYNE: I brought a motion
to suppress

07:36.803 --> 07:38.104
Mr. Shore's statement,

07:38.138 --> 07:39.740
as well as the ensuing statement

07:39.773 --> 07:41.141
from Mr. Stanfield's daughter

07:41.174 --> 07:43.544
on a poisoned-fruits theory.

07:44.477 --> 07:45.712
Can I count on you?

07:46.513 --> 07:48.314
(exhales sharply)

07:49.182 --> 07:51.952
Look, this puts me
in a very difficult position.

07:51.985 --> 07:54.354
PYNE: I realize that,
with Mr. Shore working here,

07:54.387 --> 07:56.623
but at your core,

07:56.657 --> 07:57.824
you're a defense attorney,

07:58.525 --> 08:02.102
and this whole thing
has to shock your conscience,

08:02.135 --> 08:04.137
as it does mine.

08:04.170 --> 08:06.406
FRUTT: Walter,
I don't want Brad Stanfield

08:06.439 --> 08:07.841
to get out.

08:07.874 --> 08:09.309
I'm embarrassed
to admit this,

08:09.342 --> 08:10.143
but...

08:12.478 --> 08:13.814
I'm afraid of him.

08:15.716 --> 08:16.850
Afraid of him?

08:16.883 --> 08:18.852
FRUTT: Look, Alan Shore
had a technical right

08:18.885 --> 08:19.920
to reveal what he did,

08:19.953 --> 08:22.322
plus his conduct
wasn't state action.

08:22.355 --> 08:24.858
How can you bring a motion
to suppress?

08:24.891 --> 08:28.361
PYNE: I'm not here to argue
the merits with you.

08:28.394 --> 08:29.830
I'm appealing to...

08:29.863 --> 08:31.097
a fellow defense attorney,

08:31.698 --> 08:33.332
a fellow civil libertarian,

08:33.366 --> 08:35.335
and asking you...

08:35.368 --> 08:38.038
to stand up
against what you know

08:38.071 --> 08:40.340
was a constitutional atrocity.

08:42.075 --> 08:43.009
I'm sorry,

08:44.144 --> 08:45.779
but I don't want him out.

08:48.248 --> 08:51.184
(indistinct chatter)

08:52.553 --> 08:53.720
I'm his lawyer.

08:53.754 --> 08:54.955
You're also
a potential witness.

08:54.988 --> 08:56.456
I didn't see anything.

08:56.489 --> 08:58.224
SHORE: Sheila.
I didn't even hear the boom.

08:58.258 --> 08:59.993
This is a double-murder trial.

09:00.026 --> 09:01.267
It's best to let Eugene

09:01.301 --> 09:02.468
handle it.
Why?

09:02.503 --> 09:04.137
Your experience
in criminal law is limited.

09:04.771 --> 09:06.907
WOMAN: Commonwealth
versus Roland Huff,

09:07.541 --> 09:09.042
double homicide.

09:09.075 --> 09:10.276
YOUNG: Eugene Young
for the defendant.

09:10.310 --> 09:11.912
Waive reading,
plead not guilty.

09:11.945 --> 09:14.815
It's my first criminal, Alan.
Let Eugene do this.

09:14.848 --> 09:15.949
It's not fair.
Sheila.

09:15.982 --> 09:17.818
WALLACE: The defendant
is ordered held without bail.

09:17.851 --> 09:19.586
Does defense want
a preliminary hearing?

09:19.620 --> 09:20.654
Yes, Your Honor.

09:21.287 --> 09:23.023
Uh, November 7th.

09:23.056 --> 09:24.024
Next case, please.

09:24.457 --> 09:25.926
WOMAN: Recall John Doe.

09:25.959 --> 09:27.894
We're still waiting
for a public defender on that.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.598
ROLAND: You need
to get me out.

09:31.632 --> 09:32.799
We'll see you back
in custody.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.835
Continue to say nothing
to anybody.

09:36.937 --> 09:37.704
Come on.

09:45.579 --> 09:46.547
Mr. Shore,

09:47.247 --> 09:49.149
Mr. Antitrust lawyer,

09:49.916 --> 09:53.119
I'm drafting you into the world
of pro bono law.

09:53.453 --> 09:54.254
Excuse me?

09:54.287 --> 09:56.389
Meet your new client, John Doe.

09:57.991 --> 09:59.526
Your Honor, I'm here
on another matter.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.702
Yeah, well, now you're here
on this one.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.837
See Mr. Doe in lockup,
then let's talk.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.606
Next case, please.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.640
Great.

10:06.673 --> 10:07.473
I can do it.

10:07.508 --> 10:08.709
No.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.343
Sheila, go back
to the office.

10:10.376 --> 10:11.044
I'll see you there.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.749
What have we got?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.450
Indecent exposure.

10:17.483 --> 10:18.418
He cleans toilets

10:18.451 --> 10:19.586
at the transportation authority,

10:19.620 --> 10:21.688
then gratifies himself.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.024
I'm not making it up.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.425
WOMAN: 3216,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.994
Commonwealth
versus Mitchell Penner,

10:28.028 --> 10:30.697
felony count
of mishandling a corpse.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.765
Here's the file.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.099
Uh, that's also mine,
Your Honor.

10:33.534 --> 10:35.468
Did you say
"Mishandling a corpse"?

10:35.502 --> 10:37.237
MORRIS: The defendant
is a taxidermist.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.572
Police received a report

10:38.605 --> 10:39.506
from one of his employees

10:39.540 --> 10:41.675
that he was stuffing
a human head.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.711
Now, in that this could develop
into a murder case,

10:44.745 --> 10:47.413
we'd ask that Mr. Penner
be held without bail.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.882
Are you represented, sir?

10:49.182 --> 10:50.350
No.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.251
I can't really afford a lawyer.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.787
Sheila Carlisle, Your Honor.
I'll do it.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.021
Dear God.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.690
CARLISLE: If the Commonwealth
wishes to charge murder,

10:56.723 --> 10:58.559
let them do so,
but to hold my client

10:58.592 --> 11:01.334
without bail on--what is it--
felony head-stuffing?

11:01.367 --> 11:02.736
Sheila.
One second.

11:02.769 --> 11:04.538
I'm not sure a law's
even been broken here.

11:04.571 --> 11:05.506
Sheila.
Shh.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.540
MORRIS:
Massachusetts requires

11:06.573 --> 11:09.409
all bodies and portions
thereof to be buried,

11:09.442 --> 11:10.544
entombed, or cremated.

11:10.577 --> 11:12.713
The law also allows
that citizens

11:12.746 --> 11:15.381
may will their body parts
to family members

11:15.415 --> 11:17.117
or learning institutes
for study.

11:17.150 --> 11:21.321
I refer you to MGLA 113,
section 10.

11:21.354 --> 11:22.889
You're talking about
organ donation.

11:22.923 --> 11:24.357
No, you are.

11:24.390 --> 11:26.492
The language is silent on that,

11:26.527 --> 11:29.295
suggesting a conflict
of legislative intent

11:29.329 --> 11:31.297
over whether or not
the living may determine

11:31.331 --> 11:33.099
how their bodies
are used after death.

11:33.133 --> 11:34.134
There's no conflict.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.102
CARLISLE: I'd also call
Your Honor's attention

11:36.136 --> 11:37.337
to a Pennsylvania case,

11:37.370 --> 11:38.939
Commonwealth vs. Brown,

11:38.972 --> 11:41.575
where a defendant invoked
the First Amendment,

11:41.608 --> 11:44.344
claiming he was using
body remains as art.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.412
Whose head was it,
Mr. Penner?

11:46.446 --> 11:47.748
Don't answer that.

11:47.781 --> 11:49.783
WALLACE: Counsel,
if he doesn't answer,

11:49.816 --> 11:51.518
I'm not granting him bail.
CARLISLE: Surely, Your Honor,

11:51.552 --> 11:52.653
doesn't mean to leverage bail

11:52.686 --> 11:54.688
against my client's
Fifth Amendment rights.

11:54.721 --> 11:55.656
He won't even tell us

11:55.689 --> 11:57.357
where the head is,
Your Honor.

11:57.390 --> 11:59.125
Mr. Penner stays in custody

11:59.159 --> 12:01.167
until he reveals
whose head it is

12:01.201 --> 12:02.435
and where it is.

12:03.136 --> 12:04.004
(gavel bangs)

12:06.039 --> 12:08.408
(indistinct chatter)

12:08.441 --> 12:10.511
The police beat you up?

12:10.544 --> 12:11.545
FOSTERLING: Yes.

12:12.713 --> 12:14.114
Who are you, sir?

12:14.147 --> 12:15.782
Never mind that.
You tell them

12:15.816 --> 12:17.283
if they don't drop
the charges,

12:17.317 --> 12:18.318
I'll file a brutality claim.

12:18.351 --> 12:19.886
I'm not sure that's a winner.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.487
You need to get me out.

12:21.522 --> 12:22.288
SHORE: Mr. Doe,

12:22.322 --> 12:24.290
I can probably get you released,

12:24.324 --> 12:25.992
but not without your identity.

12:26.026 --> 12:27.360
Well, they ran my prints.

12:27.393 --> 12:28.328
They know I have no record.

12:28.361 --> 12:30.764
Even so,
given your infraction...

12:30.797 --> 12:31.565
FOSTERLING: Please,

12:32.699 --> 12:34.234
get me out.

12:34.267 --> 12:35.301
(sighs)

12:38.138 --> 12:39.906
ROLAND: I started getting
very angry feelings

12:39.940 --> 12:42.408
once she told me,

12:42.442 --> 12:46.379
she told me my children
weren't really mine.

12:46.412 --> 12:49.149
Then I started feeling funny.

12:49.182 --> 12:51.518
I didn't like
how I was feeling at all.

12:51.552 --> 12:52.886
YOUNG: Okay, first thing,

12:52.919 --> 12:54.555
we're gonna have you meet
with some doctors.

12:54.588 --> 12:55.756
The most logical--
ROLAND: I don't like it

12:55.789 --> 12:57.057
when I feel like that.

12:57.558 --> 12:59.926
Roland, listen to me here.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.503
The likelihood is
that we'll plead insanity.

13:02.536 --> 13:04.571
ROLAND: They were fornicating
in my bed again.

13:04.605 --> 13:05.806
YOUNG: I understand,

13:05.839 --> 13:09.109
but it's very important that you
don't talk to anybody but us

13:09.142 --> 13:10.376
and the people we say

13:10.410 --> 13:11.712
it's okay to talk to.

13:11.745 --> 13:13.780
And we're in it
for the long haul here,

13:13.814 --> 13:15.549
but we have good legal options.

13:15.582 --> 13:17.250
Do not compromise them

13:17.283 --> 13:18.619
by speaking to anybody,

13:18.652 --> 13:20.120
not even fellow prisoners

13:20.153 --> 13:21.955
who might seem sympathetic.

13:23.990 --> 13:24.991
Are you clear?

13:29.129 --> 13:30.597
I still love her, you know.

13:32.198 --> 13:34.901
I shot her,

13:34.935 --> 13:37.103
but I love her.

13:37.137 --> 13:40.040
(music playing)

13:49.049 --> 13:50.817
She took a case.
SHORE: She ran up

13:50.851 --> 13:51.885
and got herself appointed,
Eugene.

13:51.918 --> 13:52.786
I couldn't stop her.

13:52.819 --> 13:54.420
What do you mean
you couldn't stop her?

13:54.454 --> 13:55.989
Why?
The judge assigned me a case.

13:56.022 --> 13:57.090
While I was dealing with that,

13:57.123 --> 13:58.825
she dashed up
and got one of her own.

13:59.660 --> 14:00.634
What kind of case?

14:00.667 --> 14:02.435
Mishandling a corpse.

14:02.468 --> 14:04.404
She was surprisingly
current on the law,

14:04.437 --> 14:05.972
by the way, which she--
And what's your case?

14:06.439 --> 14:07.774
Serial toilet cleaner.

14:09.042 --> 14:10.076
Jamie,

14:10.110 --> 14:11.311
are you free
to back Sheila?

14:11.344 --> 14:13.614
STRINGER: Actually, no,
I have a settlement conference.

14:13.647 --> 14:14.815
Jimmy?
Can't.

14:14.848 --> 14:17.050
I have a 12:00 meeting

14:17.083 --> 14:19.485
with a mother superior.

14:20.654 --> 14:21.287
Tara?

14:21.321 --> 14:23.089
Me?
YOUNG: Uh-huh.

14:26.359 --> 14:27.460
How crazy is she?

14:28.194 --> 14:29.195
Well, in the courtroom,

14:29.229 --> 14:30.463
she's been nothing short
of brilliant,

14:31.364 --> 14:33.266
but seeing dead bodies
can rattle a person,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.302
especially if you feel
somewhat responsible.

14:36.336 --> 14:38.438
And why would she feel
responsible?

14:39.172 --> 14:41.542
Because Roland was dropping
little clues about his anger,

14:41.575 --> 14:43.276
and it's possible...

14:43.309 --> 14:45.045
that we should have
seen it coming.

14:45.912 --> 14:46.613
It might have

14:46.647 --> 14:48.615
pushed Sheila
over the edge...

14:48.649 --> 14:49.850
a little.

14:51.484 --> 14:53.019
And how are you dealing with it?

14:53.053 --> 14:54.855
Me?

14:54.888 --> 14:56.623
I'm fine.

14:56.657 --> 14:59.593
(telephone ringing)

15:01.101 --> 15:02.836
Uh, Young, Frutt,
and Berluti.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.072
Please hold.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.574
Jamie,

15:07.608 --> 15:09.309
do you mind taking calls
if they're for you?

15:10.343 --> 15:11.712
You know,

15:11.745 --> 15:13.647
you and I are gonna need
to steal a little private time.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.148
I'd love that.

15:20.721 --> 15:22.689
The problem is...

15:22.723 --> 15:25.391
that you've broken
three separate laws, Mitchell.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.328
They can't prove
it was a human head.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.531
It's the word of one
disgruntled employee.

15:30.564 --> 15:31.998
Was it human?

15:34.801 --> 15:36.436
You can tell me.
I'm your lawyer.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.706
Mitchell,

15:39.740 --> 15:41.808
are we dealing
with a human head here?

15:43.677 --> 15:44.545
Yes.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.279
Okay.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.014
And can we rule out foul play?

15:48.048 --> 15:49.916
She died of a coronary.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.619
I have the death certificate.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.655
It's my mother.

15:55.756 --> 15:57.290
How'd you get
your mother's head?

15:57.323 --> 15:58.792
I dug her up.

15:59.826 --> 16:00.567
Why?

16:01.502 --> 16:02.936
Because I don't think
it honors a person

16:02.969 --> 16:04.738
to stick her head in dirt.

16:05.572 --> 16:07.240
If I tell them it's my mother,

16:07.273 --> 16:09.409
they'll find her
and take her away.

16:10.777 --> 16:11.945
And where is she?

16:11.978 --> 16:13.413
In my den.

16:14.615 --> 16:15.882
She's mounted on the wall.

16:17.684 --> 16:19.419
They're gonna get
a warrant, Mitchell.

16:20.954 --> 16:23.289
It's only a matter of time
before they find her.

16:23.323 --> 16:24.925
PENNER: Then you need
to help me.

16:25.391 --> 16:27.628
Her head--

16:27.661 --> 16:30.430
it's all I have left of her.

16:30.463 --> 16:33.333
Please don't let them
take her away from me.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.537
Please.

16:36.570 --> 16:37.904
MORRIS: Look,
I'd love to help you,

16:37.938 --> 16:38.972
but I can't let the guy go

16:39.005 --> 16:40.206
if I don't even know
his identity.

16:40.240 --> 16:43.009
What if he pays
court costs?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.377
We need his name,

16:44.410 --> 16:45.512
and you know that.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.351
No.

16:51.384 --> 16:52.919
Then they're gonna hold you.

16:53.419 --> 16:54.354
Indefinitely?

16:54.387 --> 16:55.455
Yes.

16:56.657 --> 16:59.392
I have a family, kids.

16:59.425 --> 17:01.434
They're gonna think I'm dead
or something.

17:01.802 --> 17:03.103
Why don't you call them?

17:04.538 --> 17:05.806
(sighs)

17:08.374 --> 17:09.041
Look,

17:11.744 --> 17:13.179
tell me your name.

17:13.213 --> 17:14.681
That stays privileged.

17:14.714 --> 17:15.816
I'll get probation

17:15.848 --> 17:16.916
to run it under the pretext

17:16.950 --> 17:18.050
I'm looking
for something else,

17:18.084 --> 17:18.852
and if you don't have
a record--

17:18.885 --> 17:19.553
I don't.

17:20.185 --> 17:21.454
Maybe I can go to the DA

17:21.487 --> 17:22.155
and vouch for you.

17:22.989 --> 17:24.057
They'll take your word?
SHORE: Well,

17:24.089 --> 17:26.092
that would be the challenge,

17:26.126 --> 17:27.861
but it's certainly worth a try.

17:30.196 --> 17:31.397
John,

17:32.332 --> 17:33.867
or whatever your name is,

17:35.168 --> 17:36.803
for me to help you,

17:36.837 --> 17:38.605
you have to trust me.

17:43.109 --> 17:46.446
My name
is Russell Fosterling.

17:47.881 --> 17:49.415
I'm an investment banker,

17:50.483 --> 17:51.852
one of considerable...

17:53.820 --> 17:54.888
prestige.

17:59.726 --> 18:00.934
Mr. Fosterling,

18:03.103 --> 18:05.138
why do you like
to clean toilets?

18:06.372 --> 18:08.742
I just...

18:08.775 --> 18:10.410
like to clean.

18:11.778 --> 18:13.714
(sighs)

18:15.381 --> 18:18.051
Did the guards beat you up?

18:18.084 --> 18:19.119
FOSTERLING: No.

18:20.954 --> 18:23.089
I did it to myself.

18:23.456 --> 18:24.691
I was so ashamed.

18:27.093 --> 18:30.463
I wanted to make myself
unrecognizable at arraignment.

18:34.034 --> 18:36.603
I'm begging you.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.004
Mr. Shore,

18:38.038 --> 18:39.105
please...

18:39.139 --> 18:40.607
get me out before...

18:43.744 --> 18:46.046
my life will be over

18:46.079 --> 18:47.548
if this becomes public.

18:47.581 --> 18:48.348
Please.

18:57.724 --> 18:59.492
Walter Pyne
is representing him?

18:59.526 --> 19:01.835
Yes.
STRINGER: Motion to suppress?

19:01.868 --> 19:02.903
This isn't state action.

19:02.936 --> 19:04.638
That's what I said.

19:05.539 --> 19:08.241
You don't actually think
he could get out, do you?

19:08.274 --> 19:10.110
STRINGER: Ellenor, even if--

19:11.411 --> 19:13.013
he's not a danger to you.

19:13.847 --> 19:16.149
There's something--

19:16.182 --> 19:18.752
he said that he would be
walking away,

19:19.419 --> 19:20.854
like he knew it,

19:20.887 --> 19:22.255
that it was the beginning,

19:22.288 --> 19:23.524
that we were
in each other's lives.

19:23.557 --> 19:25.491
It just shot through me.

19:26.126 --> 19:28.294
Ellenor, he's not getting out.

19:31.698 --> 19:32.833
You think you're funny.

19:33.499 --> 19:35.101
Well, I amuse myself to--

19:35.135 --> 19:37.170
Don't amuse yourself
at my desk, Alan.

19:38.471 --> 19:39.906
What's going on?
He downloaded

19:39.940 --> 19:41.307
some sexually-deviant website

19:41.341 --> 19:42.809
and left it there
for me to see.

19:42.843 --> 19:44.144
SHORE: It's part of a file

19:44.177 --> 19:46.246
and it's research.
Research?

19:46.279 --> 19:47.681
SHORE: Yes, on a case.
I didn't mean

19:47.714 --> 19:48.849
to leave it there
for you to see.

19:48.882 --> 19:50.817
Well, then why couldn't
you do it at your own desk?

19:50.851 --> 19:52.886
Because my desk
is across town

19:52.919 --> 19:55.522
in a corner office
with a spectacular view.

19:56.156 --> 19:56.957
And besides,

19:57.457 --> 19:58.892
I like your desk.

20:01.502 --> 20:02.536
It's research.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.077
My office a second.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.349
(door opens)

20:22.656 --> 20:25.225
You seem wound
a little tight.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.993
Before this,
you were going after Jamie.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.862
Why? Is she off limits?

20:30.030 --> 20:32.098
You saw two homicide victims
last night.

20:32.132 --> 20:33.233
I'm fine.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.701
YOUNG: Yeah,
I know you're fine.

20:34.735 --> 20:37.103
I know all about being fine.

20:37.137 --> 20:38.338
When I was
a private detective,

20:38.371 --> 20:39.606
I saw a lot
of gruesome stuff,

20:39.640 --> 20:41.107
and the only constant

20:41.141 --> 20:42.375
was that I was fine.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.179
It catches up to you, Tara.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.081
Take my word on that.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.688
Now, you have a support system
in this office.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.458
I hope you know that.

21:00.767 --> 21:01.868
Thank you.

21:05.071 --> 21:07.173
I'd like to keep you
on Roland's case.

21:07.207 --> 21:08.509
Do you think you're up to it?

21:11.044 --> 21:12.646
So you can recuse me
as a witness?

21:12.679 --> 21:15.549
No, because I can use you.

21:17.183 --> 21:18.985
Do you think you're up to it?

21:21.287 --> 21:22.322
Yes.

21:24.390 --> 21:25.659
Thank you.

21:32.866 --> 21:34.535
STRINGER:
What was that about?

21:35.769 --> 21:37.103
It was about Tara.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.005
You need something?

21:42.609 --> 21:43.644
No.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.291
(music playing)

22:48.281 --> 22:49.883
What do you mean
you know her?

22:49.916 --> 22:50.584
CARLISLE: I do.

22:50.617 --> 22:52.285
I've known her
all my life.

22:52.318 --> 22:53.920
What's more,
she just came

22:53.954 --> 22:55.822
to me again
two nights ago.

22:56.222 --> 22:57.323
Eugene?

22:57.891 --> 22:58.792
What's wrong?

22:59.325 --> 23:00.366
Oh, nothing.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.868
Everything's wonderful.

23:02.168 --> 23:03.537
The head stuffed

23:03.570 --> 23:05.506
by Sheila's taxidermist client

23:05.539 --> 23:07.040
is actually
the head of Saint...

23:07.073 --> 23:08.609
Catherine.
WILSON: Saint Catherine,

23:08.642 --> 23:10.911
a saint that has been
visiting Sheila

23:10.944 --> 23:11.978
much of her life.

23:12.012 --> 23:14.047
She recognized it.

23:15.015 --> 23:17.117
You saw the head?
CARLISLE: Yes,

23:17.150 --> 23:18.585
and we cannot let her fall

23:18.619 --> 23:20.186
into the hands of the state.

23:20.220 --> 23:21.988
She's in your office.

23:22.022 --> 23:23.724
What do you mean
she's in my off--

23:23.757 --> 23:25.892
the head is in my office?
Yeah.

23:31.832 --> 23:33.433
I'm sorry,
but it was the environment

23:33.466 --> 23:35.602
with the highest stature,
at least in this firm,

23:35.636 --> 23:36.737
where I'd like
to maintain her.

23:37.504 --> 23:39.573
She'll watch over us, Eugene.

23:39.606 --> 23:41.708
She can watch
over all of us.

23:44.878 --> 23:46.012
You would pay
full court costs,

23:46.046 --> 23:46.847
plead guilty.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.049
So it goes on my record.
SHORE: Yes,

23:49.082 --> 23:50.016
but the DA has agreed

23:50.050 --> 23:51.317
to make
a joint recommendation

23:51.351 --> 23:52.986
that the conviction
be sealed.

23:53.019 --> 23:54.988
The judge still
has to approve, but--

23:55.021 --> 23:56.389
I have to give
the DA my name?

23:56.422 --> 23:57.524
SHORE: Yes.

23:57.558 --> 23:58.892
You committed a crime.

23:58.925 --> 23:59.893
You have to have a record,

23:59.926 --> 24:01.868
but it'll be sealed.

24:01.902 --> 24:03.670
As long as you don't commit
another crime,

24:03.704 --> 24:04.938
it'll stay sealed.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.108
Mr. Fosterling,

24:08.141 --> 24:10.744
it is your best out.

24:11.845 --> 24:14.247
It's also
the very best I can do.

24:14.881 --> 24:16.650
And my face--

24:16.683 --> 24:17.951
what will I tell people?

24:18.284 --> 24:19.252
That you were mugged

24:19.285 --> 24:21.421
or in an accident
and hospitalized,

24:21.454 --> 24:22.723
whatever you want
to tell them.

24:22.756 --> 24:24.190
(cellular phone rings)

24:24.224 --> 24:26.059
SHORE: Oh, I apologize.

24:28.194 --> 24:29.863
Hello?

24:29.896 --> 24:31.264
What?

24:31.297 --> 24:32.232
Whose head?

24:33.734 --> 24:35.602
PYNE: For double jeopardy
to be undone here

24:35.636 --> 24:36.970
is ludicrous.

24:37.003 --> 24:39.272
Attorney-client privilege
is the oldest

24:39.305 --> 24:40.707
of all common law privileges.

24:40.741 --> 24:43.810
Mr. Pyne is ignoring
rule 1.6(b)(1),

24:43.844 --> 24:46.446
one which allows disclosure
of privileged information

24:46.479 --> 24:49.149
to prevent the wrongful
incarceration of another.

24:49.182 --> 24:51.117
In this case--
PYNE: I don't ignore it!

24:51.151 --> 24:52.953
I say it doesn't apply.

24:53.319 --> 24:54.655
Rule 1.6(b)(1)--

24:54.688 --> 24:56.957
This man killed
his pregnant wife,

24:56.990 --> 24:58.892
and then he--
PYNE: I object to that button

24:58.925 --> 25:01.568
being pushed as if
it were a point of law.

25:01.602 --> 25:04.337
And while we're talking
about fraud, Your Honor,

25:04.370 --> 25:06.973
Mr. Stanfield may very well

25:07.007 --> 25:08.241
have duped his lawyer

25:08.274 --> 25:11.077
and all the players
in his trial,

25:11.111 --> 25:14.615
but Alan Shore defrauded
our criminal justice system,

25:14.648 --> 25:16.149
a much more
egregious transgress--

25:16.182 --> 25:19.085
CAMPBELL: Mr. Stanfield
orchestrated a mistrial.

25:19.119 --> 25:21.221
He played his attorneys
to approach the judge

25:21.254 --> 25:22.422
as officers of the court.

25:22.455 --> 25:23.957
He used them as conduits

25:23.990 --> 25:25.225
to defraud the system

25:25.258 --> 25:26.693
Mr. Pyne holds so dear.

25:26.727 --> 25:30.030
Brad Stanfield walked free
as a double murderer

25:30.063 --> 25:32.933
while his 10-year-old daughter
was put in jail.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.736
Since Alan Shore
didn't like that, he said,

25:35.769 --> 25:36.970
"To hell with the rules.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.339
To hell with attorney-client
privilege."

25:39.372 --> 25:41.975
If this court
says okay to that,

25:42.008 --> 25:44.611
the Sixth Amendment right
to counsel is obliterated.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.114
Mr. Stanfield, stand up.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.254
I want to know exactly

25:54.287 --> 25:56.056
what you said to Ms. Frutt.

25:56.489 --> 25:57.357
Forgive me, Your Honor,

25:57.390 --> 25:59.325
but privilege may not extend

25:59.359 --> 26:01.467
to what I say to you
in open court.

26:01.501 --> 26:04.505
You seem to be quite savvy
on the law, sir.

26:04.538 --> 26:06.840
I certainly understand
the Sixth Amendment,

26:06.873 --> 26:08.474
and I relied on it when talking

26:08.509 --> 26:09.475
to Ellenor Frutt.

26:09.510 --> 26:11.912
WILCOX: Did you rely
on Ms. Frutt to act

26:11.945 --> 26:13.213
as an officer of the court

26:13.246 --> 26:15.215
to help carry out your fraud?

26:15.248 --> 26:17.618
I relied on her
to uphold the law

26:17.651 --> 26:19.686
to her best ability,

26:19.720 --> 26:22.689
as I rely on you
to do so now.

26:22.723 --> 26:25.659
(indistinct chatter)

26:30.096 --> 26:31.131
Where is she?

26:31.164 --> 26:32.833
WILSON: Eugene's office
with her shrine.

26:32.866 --> 26:33.600
Alan?

26:33.634 --> 26:34.467
I'm on it.

26:46.647 --> 26:47.413
Sheila.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.850
Look at her, Alan.

26:51.117 --> 26:53.319
Isn't she incredible?

26:56.456 --> 26:58.391
I don't have the words.

26:58.424 --> 27:01.334
When I was a very young girl,

27:01.367 --> 27:03.537
she used to come
to me in visions.

27:03.570 --> 27:05.639
She used to give me advice

27:05.672 --> 27:07.774
and watch over me,

27:07.808 --> 27:09.375
then she went away.

27:09.409 --> 27:12.913
Three years ago,
she appeared to me again.

27:12.946 --> 27:15.582
Oh, her name's Catherine.

27:15.616 --> 27:16.817
She's a saint.

27:17.751 --> 27:19.452
Sheila, it's a head.

27:21.487 --> 27:24.525
She looks at home
in this room.

27:24.558 --> 27:26.026
Doesn't she look at home?

27:26.059 --> 27:28.995
(music playing)

27:33.399 --> 27:34.200
Okay.

27:36.537 --> 27:38.304
Visions and wanderings,

27:38.338 --> 27:40.641
headless completely aside,

27:40.674 --> 27:44.611
MGLA chapter 114,
section 43m

27:44.645 --> 27:46.079
does not permit her
display here.

27:46.713 --> 27:48.448
Plus, you have a client
in custody,

27:48.481 --> 27:50.316
who I believe needs this
as evidence

27:50.350 --> 27:52.052
to support his--
The complainant witness ID'd

27:52.085 --> 27:53.987
my client's deceased mother.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.256
The death certificate
confirmed natural causes.

27:56.289 --> 27:58.324
My client was cleared
of homicide.

27:58.358 --> 27:59.893
We paid the fine,

27:59.926 --> 28:01.802
pled guilty,
accepted probation.

28:01.835 --> 28:04.004
He's home,
happy his mother

28:04.037 --> 28:05.071
is in a place of honor.

28:05.105 --> 28:06.472
But you're committing
a crime now.

28:06.507 --> 28:09.009
Technically,
I'm studying her,

28:09.042 --> 28:12.012
pursuant to chapter 113,
section 10.

28:12.045 --> 28:13.413
SHORE: You're not
a learning institution.

28:13.446 --> 28:14.748
This is
a health-code violation,

28:14.781 --> 28:17.050
and under chapter 272,
section 71--

28:17.083 --> 28:18.852
You're making her angry!

28:18.885 --> 28:19.553
Get out!

28:20.320 --> 28:21.722
You're off on the law, Sheila.

28:21.755 --> 28:23.857
Get out!
You're off on the law.

28:23.890 --> 28:24.791
Get out!

28:34.968 --> 28:37.971
I need you to be
a good lawyer here.

28:40.473 --> 28:43.143
Catherine doesn't want
that right now.

28:57.891 --> 29:00.834
(siren wailing)

29:05.338 --> 29:08.174
I don't think
she likes being draped.

29:08.208 --> 29:09.409
I draped her, Sheila,

29:09.442 --> 29:11.211
because I need you
to look at me now.

29:13.479 --> 29:15.448
Sheila, without
arguing the merits

29:15.481 --> 29:17.350
of our separate realities,

29:18.519 --> 29:20.754
I represented
to the people here

29:20.787 --> 29:23.089
that yours
would not interfere

29:23.123 --> 29:24.190
with their practice.

29:24.825 --> 29:26.760
In fact, I went so far
as to say

29:26.793 --> 29:30.230
once you entered
the arena of law,

29:30.263 --> 29:32.933
your sensibilities
were beyond reproach.

29:35.669 --> 29:38.204
I can no longer
say that, Sheila.

29:38.238 --> 29:39.640
I no longer believe it.

29:41.975 --> 29:44.010
You are incompetent

29:44.044 --> 29:45.045
to practice.

29:47.047 --> 29:48.549
Do I not win my cases,

29:48.582 --> 29:51.117
all of them,
even this one?

29:51.151 --> 29:52.853
I got a good result
for my client,

29:52.886 --> 29:54.120
who is very pleased.

29:54.855 --> 29:56.056
I spoke to your doctor--

29:56.089 --> 29:57.223
On whose authority?

29:57.257 --> 29:58.725
SHORE: And he thinks
your situation

29:58.759 --> 30:01.101
has been exacerbated
by trauma.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.504
He strongly believes
you need to be on medication.

30:03.537 --> 30:04.771
That doesn't work for me.

30:04.805 --> 30:07.373
Sheila.
That does not work for me.

30:09.643 --> 30:11.612
Then you need to leave.

30:11.645 --> 30:12.913
You can't work here.

30:14.147 --> 30:16.349
I feel like
I just settled in.

30:20.521 --> 30:23.056
You are a dear friend,

30:23.089 --> 30:25.291
and I love you,

30:25.325 --> 30:27.093
but unless
you get treatment...

30:27.127 --> 30:30.897
Please, just give it a week.

30:30.931 --> 30:33.066
You watch.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.069
Catherine will bless
all of us.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.071
I promise you.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.612
You need to leave here.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.751
Then I'll go.

30:50.784 --> 30:51.952
Sheila.

30:51.985 --> 30:53.887
I'm going, Alan.

30:59.092 --> 30:59.893
BAILIFF: Be seated.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.978
I have studied rule 1.6,

31:12.012 --> 31:13.914
and it does indeed allow
for lawyers

31:13.947 --> 31:15.916
to violate privilege

31:15.949 --> 31:18.585
to prevent the wrongful
incarceration of another.

31:19.319 --> 31:21.287
No lawyer has ever
done this before,

31:21.321 --> 31:22.956
but the rule is there,

31:22.989 --> 31:24.958
which I suspect
saved Mr. Shore

31:24.991 --> 31:27.027
from disbarment.

31:27.060 --> 31:29.429
To use a disclosed information

31:29.462 --> 31:31.598
in a subsequent trial, however,

31:31.632 --> 31:33.166
I agree with Mr. Pyne.

31:33.199 --> 31:35.301
There's no authority for that.

31:35.335 --> 31:38.004
I also agree
the Sixth Amendment

31:38.038 --> 31:39.339
would be meaningless

31:39.372 --> 31:40.674
if we let lawyers give evidence

31:40.707 --> 31:42.075
against their clients.

31:43.343 --> 31:45.679
Mr. Shore's statement
is quashed,

31:45.712 --> 31:47.881
as is that
of Mr. Stanfield's daughter,

31:47.914 --> 31:50.684
which constitutes
poisonous fruits.

31:50.984 --> 31:52.185
The question becomes,

31:52.218 --> 31:55.388
do we then just retry
Mr. Stanfield

31:55.421 --> 31:56.356
with the old evidence?

31:56.723 --> 31:58.992
That seems to make sense.

31:59.025 --> 32:01.835
Problem is, overturning
double jeopardy here

32:01.868 --> 32:03.236
would still rely on giving

32:03.269 --> 32:06.640
Mr. Shore's disclosure
legal teeth.

32:06.673 --> 32:10.176
And due process just won't
allow me to do that.

32:10.210 --> 32:11.912
(indistinct chatter)

32:11.945 --> 32:15.481
WILCOX: I'm holding
that double jeopardy

32:15.516 --> 32:17.283
therefore attaches

32:17.317 --> 32:18.852
to the first mistrial.

32:18.885 --> 32:21.321
As a matter of law,

32:21.354 --> 32:23.857
Mr. Stanfield
cannot be tried twice

32:23.890 --> 32:26.326
for the same crimes.

32:26.359 --> 32:27.661
He is therefore

32:27.694 --> 32:28.762
free to go.

32:28.795 --> 32:31.197
(indistinct chatter)

32:31.231 --> 32:31.932
(gavel bangs)

32:31.965 --> 32:34.868
(music playing)

32:49.315 --> 32:51.384
Ellenor.
I'm not gonna make a scene.

32:54.855 --> 32:56.222
You won.

32:56.256 --> 32:57.858
Congratulations.

32:59.259 --> 33:02.002
This is the final chapter, Brad.

33:02.035 --> 33:04.638
Story over.

33:04.671 --> 33:07.641
You and I are not
in each other's lives.

33:09.175 --> 33:10.644
No hard feelings, Ellenor.

33:15.448 --> 33:16.883
If you can't take
my hand, Ellenor,

33:16.917 --> 33:19.620
how can I trust that
we've resolved our differences?

33:24.658 --> 33:26.927
If I should be sued civilly,

33:26.960 --> 33:28.261
I will, of course,
expect you

33:28.294 --> 33:30.764
not to give
testimony against me.

33:30.797 --> 33:33.634
That would open up
another chapter.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.401
PYNE: All right, Brad.

33:36.336 --> 33:37.303
MAN: Ms. Frutt--

33:37.337 --> 33:39.372
(indistinct chatter)

33:39.405 --> 33:40.974
REPORTER:
Why'd you kill your wife?

33:41.007 --> 33:43.276
BRAD: Obviously,
I'm gratified

33:43.309 --> 33:44.645
we have a judicial system

33:44.678 --> 33:46.580
that values the constitution

33:46.613 --> 33:48.915
as intended
by our founding fathers.

33:48.949 --> 33:51.184
It's rewarding to see
the court prioritize

33:51.217 --> 33:53.453
those principles
over the lawlessness

33:53.486 --> 33:55.155
of one aberrant attorney.

33:55.188 --> 33:58.158
(indistinct chatter)

33:58.191 --> 34:01.134
(music playing)

34:08.341 --> 34:12.012
I don't think I can
survive in this place.

34:12.045 --> 34:13.013
YOUNG: We're gonna try
to get you

34:13.045 --> 34:15.081
the fastest
trial date possible.

34:15.114 --> 34:16.683
ROLAND: Before Christmas?

34:16.717 --> 34:19.052
I need to be with my kids
for Christmas.

34:19.085 --> 34:21.353
Can they get me bail
for Christmas

34:21.387 --> 34:23.289
for my kids' sake?

34:23.322 --> 34:25.058
They have no mother.

34:25.091 --> 34:28.094
YOUNG: Well, that appeal
usually doesn't work

34:28.128 --> 34:30.831
for the defendant
who killed the mother.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.237
Am I ever gonna get out?

34:38.505 --> 34:40.974
YOUNG: What we propose
is to argue insanity,

34:41.007 --> 34:43.109
and we think we can make
a strong case there.

34:43.143 --> 34:44.911
ROLAND: Tell me
you'll get me out.

34:44.945 --> 34:46.913
I need to know I'll get out.

34:46.947 --> 34:47.781
Roland...

34:49.683 --> 34:51.051
We're going to get you out.

34:56.188 --> 34:58.024
You promise?

34:58.058 --> 35:01.001
(music playing)

35:06.472 --> 35:07.473
We promise.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.812
(sighs)

35:13.980 --> 35:16.917
You understand
if you violate probation,

35:16.950 --> 35:19.252
we can go back
and impose time.

35:19.620 --> 35:20.921
Yes, sir.

35:20.954 --> 35:22.589
WALLACE: You're getting
an enormous break here,

35:22.623 --> 35:23.590
Mr. Fosterling.

35:23.624 --> 35:24.858
For this matter to be sealed,

35:24.891 --> 35:25.692
you're very fortunate.

35:25.726 --> 35:27.794
This is a special favor.

35:29.095 --> 35:30.631
I appreciate that,
Your Honor.

35:33.534 --> 35:36.737
Why do you clean toilets

35:36.770 --> 35:37.771
and then...

35:39.940 --> 35:41.241
if I may ask?

35:41.274 --> 35:43.076
I don't think that's relevant,
Your Honor.

35:43.109 --> 35:44.477
It's relevant to me.

35:51.652 --> 35:54.054
It was for...

35:54.087 --> 35:55.656
personal reasons.

35:56.022 --> 35:57.858
WALLACE: Personal reasons?

35:58.458 --> 35:59.225
It's a bit different

35:59.259 --> 36:00.601
from your antitrust clients,

36:00.634 --> 36:01.735
huh, Mr. Shore?

36:08.642 --> 36:09.543
(sighs)

36:12.345 --> 36:13.847
Can you look at me, sir?

36:19.520 --> 36:20.754
It won't get out.

36:29.129 --> 36:30.263
(sighs)

36:36.236 --> 36:37.337
I appreciate your help.

36:38.004 --> 36:39.573
Certainly,
I expect to pay you

36:39.606 --> 36:40.874
for your services.

36:41.508 --> 36:44.611
Mr. Fosterling,
I have a book.

36:44.645 --> 36:46.680
It's a case study,

36:46.713 --> 36:48.414
"Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual

36:48.448 --> 36:49.950
of Behavioral Anomalies"

36:49.983 --> 36:51.417
and there's a case in here

36:51.451 --> 36:53.053
that talks about a person

36:53.086 --> 36:55.355
being sexually stimulated
by men's rooms.

36:55.388 --> 36:57.057
It's included in the section

36:57.090 --> 36:59.726
"Paraphilia
Not Otherwise Specified."

36:59.760 --> 37:01.234
I offer you this...

37:03.436 --> 37:05.071
because I detect a fair amount

37:05.104 --> 37:07.841
of self-loathing.

37:08.642 --> 37:09.643
And...

37:11.344 --> 37:14.681
I don't think you're sick,
Mr. Fosterling.

37:14.714 --> 37:16.616
I think you're peculiar,

37:16.650 --> 37:19.520
but a lot of us

37:19.553 --> 37:21.988
are quite peculiar.

37:23.089 --> 37:26.392
And maybe
with a little help,

37:26.426 --> 37:28.662
you could find a way
to continue

37:28.695 --> 37:30.463
to enjoy yourself...

37:32.633 --> 37:35.068
that doesn't make
you hate yourself.

37:39.339 --> 37:41.708
Anyway, I give you the book...

37:44.945 --> 37:46.346
and I wish you well.

37:49.916 --> 37:51.051
(elevator dings)

37:52.653 --> 37:53.486
Mr. Shore...

37:56.222 --> 37:58.091
(sighs) Thank you.

38:06.740 --> 38:08.408
Not just this jurisdiction

38:08.441 --> 38:09.375
or first circuit.

38:09.409 --> 38:11.044
I want to see
every insanity case

38:11.077 --> 38:12.178
in the country
where jealousy

38:12.212 --> 38:14.180
was the motivating factor.

38:14.214 --> 38:16.282
Tara, I want you to focus
on the legal research.

38:16.316 --> 38:19.152
Jamie, you start
lining up doctors.

38:19.185 --> 38:21.221
I wanna move fast on this,
because I don't think Roland's

38:21.254 --> 38:22.723
gonna hold up well in jail.

38:23.289 --> 38:24.490
Jamie, for fun,

38:24.525 --> 38:26.326
I want you to go through
the incident reports,

38:26.359 --> 38:27.327
forensics.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.261
Give me an opinion
as to whether

38:28.294 --> 38:29.495
we got any shot
on the elements.

38:29.530 --> 38:31.998
No sense in going insanity
if we don't have to.

38:32.032 --> 38:32.966
We all clear?

38:35.235 --> 38:36.136
Good.

38:39.506 --> 38:40.974
I have a couple of sites
I can give you

38:41.007 --> 38:41.942
to get you started.

38:42.509 --> 38:43.309
Thanks.

38:44.911 --> 38:45.579
Uh, Jamie?

38:47.380 --> 38:48.882
Sorry, uh,

38:48.915 --> 38:49.816
for, um...

38:51.685 --> 38:53.186
it's been one of those weeks.

38:53.554 --> 38:54.387
I get it.

38:55.989 --> 38:58.391
Listen, if you need to talk...

39:00.901 --> 39:01.768
try Ellenor.

39:08.274 --> 39:08.975
They took it.

39:09.009 --> 39:10.611
They just marched in here

39:10.644 --> 39:11.377
and seized it.

39:11.411 --> 39:12.345
Can you believe it?

39:12.378 --> 39:13.714
Well, you don't
actually need

39:13.747 --> 39:15.516
the head of Saint Catherine,
do you?

39:15.549 --> 39:17.250
It's her spirit
that matters most.

39:19.219 --> 39:22.088
You really think
I'm nuts, don't you?

39:24.157 --> 39:25.291
You've had your moments.

39:27.894 --> 39:30.363
Sometimes, I envy
the world you live in.

39:31.998 --> 39:33.399
You're so sweet.

39:37.003 --> 39:38.338
Sometimes, I think you and I

39:38.371 --> 39:40.541
would make for great lovers.

39:40.574 --> 39:43.510
(music playing)

39:46.446 --> 39:48.749
SHORE: You're not getting out
of my life, now, Sheila,

39:48.782 --> 39:50.016
only this office.

39:51.885 --> 39:52.953
You and I will still...

40:01.535 --> 40:03.103
I'm always here for you.

40:03.136 --> 40:06.072
(music playing)

40:09.943 --> 40:11.512
(sighs)

40:11.545 --> 40:14.480
(music playing)

40:33.199 --> 40:34.000
Well...

40:38.839 --> 40:40.574
guess I better go.

40:46.446 --> 40:48.048
Say goodbye to the group.

40:48.348 --> 40:49.315
Yeah.

41:09.776 --> 41:12.412
Don't everybody look so sad.

41:12.445 --> 41:13.479
I'll be...

41:18.051 --> 41:20.521
thank you so much.

41:20.554 --> 41:22.956
You've all been incredibly
generous with me,

41:22.989 --> 41:25.358
and, Tara,

41:26.760 --> 41:28.929
I loved trying
our case together.

41:31.832 --> 41:35.201
Eugene, you're a good boss.

41:37.538 --> 41:38.271
Jimmy, hang in there

41:38.304 --> 41:40.140
with your nun case, okay?

41:40.173 --> 41:42.108
Though the church
can dismiss her

41:42.142 --> 41:44.310
under canon law,
the fact is,

41:44.344 --> 41:45.946
they often
don't dismiss priests

41:45.979 --> 41:47.447
for having sex,

41:47.480 --> 41:49.716
which means, in truth,
they're probably firing her

41:49.750 --> 41:53.119
for being pregnant, which
is a direct violation of title 7

41:53.153 --> 41:55.689
Klein vs. Catholic Diocese
of Toledo.

41:57.323 --> 41:58.324
Thanks.

41:59.760 --> 42:03.003
CARLISLE: Anyway,
you are all such kind

42:03.036 --> 42:04.938
and charitable people.

42:04.971 --> 42:06.873
And though
I haven't known you long,

42:08.609 --> 42:09.976
I will miss you.

42:10.010 --> 42:12.946
(music playing)

42:14.314 --> 42:16.149
We'll stay in touch, right?

42:16.683 --> 42:18.118
We shall.

42:18.151 --> 42:20.386
(music playing)

42:20.420 --> 42:21.688
(sighs)

42:21.722 --> 42:24.658
(music playing)

42:39.606 --> 42:40.941
(door opens)

42:43.276 --> 42:44.945
(door closes)

42:44.978 --> 42:47.914
(music playing)

42:56.356 --> 42:59.292
(music playing)

43:22.656 --> 43:23.690
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:23.724 --> 43:26.727
(music playing)
