00:21.945 --> 00:24.983
Once the world was full of wonders,

00:24.985 --> 00:27.225
but it belongs to humans now.

00:30.745 --> 00:33.423
We creatures
have all but disappeared -

00:33.425 --> 00:36.305
demons, vampires and witches...

00:37.505 --> 00:40.023
hiding in plain sight,

00:40.025 --> 00:41.943
fearful of discovery,

00:41.945 --> 00:44.385
ill at ease, even with each other.

00:58.345 --> 01:01.185
But, as my father used to say,

01:02.665 --> 01:05.263
in every ending...

01:05.265 --> 01:06.745
there is a new beginning.

01:35.385 --> 01:37.383
-Hi, Fred.
-Good morning.

01:37.385 --> 01:38.825
Good morning.

02:53.225 --> 02:54.545
No, stop!

03:09.505 --> 03:12.303
Please, join me
in welcoming back to Oxford...

03:12.305 --> 03:14.225
this year's visiting research fellow.

03:14.705 --> 03:18.983
As many of you know, she took her
DPhil in the history of science here.

03:18.985 --> 03:21.463
And after publishing
two prize-winning books,

03:21.465 --> 03:23.903
she was awarded tenure at Yale,

03:23.905 --> 03:27.143
one of the youngest ever
to have been awarded that distinction.

03:27.145 --> 03:30.423
We are delighted
to have her back amongst us -

03:30.425 --> 03:31.825
Dr Diana Bishop.

03:33.345 --> 03:36.145
Thank you. Thank you so much.

03:37.145 --> 03:38.465
Alchemy.

03:39.905 --> 03:45.223
In the 17th century, alchemy was at
the very heart of the study of nature

03:45.225 --> 03:47.223
and a precursor to modern chemistry...

03:47.225 --> 03:51.183
..and death. All parts of the natural
world, be they animate or inanimate,

03:51.185 --> 03:53.263
were believed to experience
these stages.

03:53.265 --> 03:56.543
Although these images were
often interpreted as allegory,

03:56.545 --> 03:59.143
they actually represent
the chemical processes...

03:59.145 --> 04:01.383
With access to
the Bodleian Library's collection

04:01.385 --> 04:04.743
of unique manuscripts
owned by Elias Ashmole,

04:04.745 --> 04:08.383
the 17th-century antiquarian,
astrologer and alchemist,

04:08.385 --> 04:11.943
I will continue to explore
the role that alchemy had

04:11.945 --> 04:13.903
in 17th-century thought

04:13.905 --> 04:18.942
and how it influenced great scientists
such as Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle.

04:18.945 --> 04:20.385
Thank you.

04:23.105 --> 04:25.105
-Very stimulating.
-Thank you.

04:26.225 --> 04:28.903
There's an opening
coming up soon in the faculty.

04:28.905 --> 04:31.905
I'm drawing up a shortlist of
candidates. Would it interest you?

04:32.905 --> 04:35.943
-Er, yes.
-We'll need to evaluate all your work.

04:35.945 --> 04:40.103
The talk that you just gave today -
I assume it's ready to be published?

04:40.105 --> 04:43.263
It is, it is. It's almost finished.

04:43.265 --> 04:46.343
-Well, I'd need it by late October.
-Absolutely.

04:46.345 --> 04:48.343
-I look forward to reading it.
-Thank you.

04:48.345 --> 04:49.943
Diana, that was brilliant.

04:49.945 --> 04:54.223
Gillian Chamberlain at a lecture
for alchemy? What a lovely surprise.

04:54.225 --> 04:57.383
It's been, what, four years
since I've seen you?

04:57.385 --> 04:59.823
Almost six, actually.
Can't believe it.

04:59.825 --> 05:02.583
-When did you arrive?
-Over a week ago.

05:02.585 --> 05:06.105
I've been practically living in
the library. I haven't even unpacked.

05:06.665 --> 05:09.463
It is so good to see you.

05:09.465 --> 05:11.023
It's like...

05:11.025 --> 05:13.625
No, it's like coming home,
nothing's changed.

05:14.745 --> 05:16.225
Tell me about it.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.583
I'm not regular faculty, that's all.

05:20.585 --> 05:23.183
Still no vacancies
for a classical historian.

05:23.185 --> 05:24.545
I'm sorry.

05:25.545 --> 05:27.905
-If there is anything I can do.
-It'll happen.

05:28.905 --> 05:31.103
Otherwise, Oxford's still great.

05:31.105 --> 05:34.063
The coven's pretty active.
We're meeting tonight for the equinox.

05:34.065 --> 05:36.625
You'll know loads of us
if you wanted to come.

05:37.665 --> 05:40.743
I'm still not comfortable
around magic.

05:40.745 --> 05:43.065
Not after what happened to my parents.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.545
I still find it...

05:48.585 --> 05:50.225
I just find it difficult.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.503
Do you not use your powers at all?

05:53.505 --> 05:56.823
I am a walking disaster on that front.

05:56.825 --> 05:58.743
My powers are so unpredictable.

05:58.745 --> 06:02.703
This morning, it happened
by accident in public.

06:02.705 --> 06:04.865
I mean, no one saw,
but they could have.

06:07.465 --> 06:10.263
You should speak to Sylvia about that.

06:10.265 --> 06:12.543
She's the head of coven now.
She might be able to help you.

06:12.545 --> 06:14.345
It's okay. I'm used to it.

06:56.065 --> 06:58.823
I hear your lecture impressed
a few people yesterday.

06:58.825 --> 07:01.623
So, now you've got to get
that paper finished, right?

07:01.625 --> 07:03.343
What do you need?

07:03.345 --> 07:08.383
-Ashmole 37, 92, 183 and 782.
-782.

07:08.385 --> 07:10.823
No problem. Be with you shortly.

07:10.825 --> 07:12.145
Thanks.

08:06.185 --> 08:09.783
-Hey! How's it going?
-Hey.

08:09.785 --> 08:11.865
Oh, just the usual, you know.

08:13.505 --> 08:15.943
There you go, the Ashmole manuscripts.

08:15.945 --> 08:17.265
Thank you.

08:23.905 --> 08:26.743
Right, so, I'm out by the call desk.

08:26.745 --> 08:29.343
-Maybe we could have a coffee later?
-Yeah, great.

08:29.345 --> 08:31.385
-Awesome. See you.
-Okay, bye.

09:46.465 --> 09:48.505
Christ! Someone needs
to fix the lights.

10:23.825 --> 10:27.063
-Is it happening to you?
-Yes.

10:27.065 --> 10:29.183
Our blood...

10:29.185 --> 10:31.705
it's reacting to something.

11:26.785 --> 11:28.265
Sorry, sorry.

11:43.825 --> 11:45.305
Dr Bishop?

12:09.265 --> 12:11.505
-I'm such an idiot, I...
-Just need to check the fuses again.

12:27.105 --> 12:28.465
Dad.

12:35.065 --> 12:36.385
Dad?

12:38.065 --> 12:40.305
-Dad?
-Diana!

12:41.145 --> 12:42.465
What happened in there?

12:44.745 --> 12:48.183
Did you feel it?
I don't think the humans did.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.105
That Ashmole manuscript,
there was something weird about it.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.025
Did you see anything unusual?

12:56.025 --> 12:57.345
Diana, are you all right?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.265
Diana?

13:01.905 --> 13:03.905
Where are you going?

13:15.325 --> 13:17.843
So I presume I'm seeing you tonight.

13:17.845 --> 13:19.443
-No.
-Come on.

13:19.445 --> 13:21.083
-No.
-James, look, I've found a new place.

13:21.085 --> 13:23.923
I've just been on a 12-hour shift.
I'm going home to crash.

13:23.925 --> 13:26.123
Last week was a mistake
and I admit last week was a mistake.

13:26.125 --> 13:28.243
-That's what you said last week.
-Tuesday's better than the weekend.

13:28.245 --> 13:30.923
You can get a booth,
it stays open till 3:00 am...

13:30.925 --> 13:33.123
3:00 am, midweek?
Are you off your rocker?

13:33.125 --> 13:37.243
And I'm pretty sure the DJ plays
almost exclusively '90s R&B.

13:37.245 --> 13:40.603
See, when I'm not on shift,
I'm in bed by 12.

13:40.605 --> 13:43.723
-How come you never look tired?
-I'm not a lightweight like you.

13:43.725 --> 13:45.045
A-huh.

13:46.245 --> 13:47.925
Have a good sleep.

13:50.165 --> 13:53.125
-Five-a-side next week!
-If you're awake.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.365
No!

14:11.485 --> 14:12.925
James, mate!

14:14.965 --> 14:16.485
Hang in there, James.

15:25.485 --> 15:26.805
No.

15:40.845 --> 15:43.203
Matthew, have you been here all night?

15:43.205 --> 15:46.325
She's a witch, Miriam, a powerful one
if her family's anything to go by.

15:46.685 --> 15:48.283
Who is?

15:48.285 --> 15:51.043
The academic I overheard
outside the Bodleian.

15:51.045 --> 15:53.163
She's a direct descendant
of Bridget Bishop,

15:53.165 --> 15:55.403
the first woman to be executed
at the Salem witch trials.

15:55.405 --> 15:57.643
You think what happened yesterday
was witchcraft?

15:57.645 --> 16:00.485
I don't know, but she'd just taken out
an alchemy manuscript.

16:01.485 --> 16:02.965
An Ashmole manuscript.

16:05.525 --> 16:08.523
Come on, Matthew,
it's not possible.

16:08.525 --> 16:10.803
What, that she's found
Ashmole 782? Why?

16:10.805 --> 16:13.283
Because you've been looking
for that book for over 100 years.

16:13.285 --> 16:15.843
Longer.
Ever since I began to believe

16:15.845 --> 16:18.123
that it could help us understand
our origins.

16:18.125 --> 16:19.683
It's missing.

16:19.685 --> 16:24.123
It's always been missing.
How could this witch have found it?

16:24.125 --> 16:25.925
Perhaps it wasn't missing.

16:30.405 --> 16:33.125
Perhaps it was waiting.

16:40.805 --> 16:42.125
Dad.

16:49.365 --> 16:53.405
Next up on Radio 4, it's
Rebecca Ali with Woman's Hour.

17:34.685 --> 17:37.565
-Hello.
-Hey. Er, it's me.

17:38.805 --> 17:41.085
Hey. You all right?

17:42.165 --> 17:44.483
It's five o'clock in the morning,
Diana.

17:44.485 --> 17:46.323
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

17:46.325 --> 17:48.523
Something's happened.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.323
-You all right, honey?
-I was in the Bod studying.

17:51.325 --> 17:52.963
I took out a manuscript.

17:52.965 --> 17:55.803
But it was bewitched or something.

17:55.805 --> 17:58.923
-Was it a grimoire?
-It was an Ashmole manuscript.

17:58.925 --> 18:02.523
-There were alchemical illustrations.
-Uh-huh, what else?

18:02.525 --> 18:03.845
Er...

18:05.925 --> 18:08.963
Moving under the pages.

18:08.965 --> 18:10.603
I couldn't read it.

18:10.605 --> 18:13.243
Definitely sounds
like it was bewitched.

18:13.245 --> 18:15.085
How did you unravel the spell?
Did you say any words?

18:17.205 --> 18:19.843
There was no witchcraft involved,
Sarah.

18:19.845 --> 18:22.483
How many times?
You know I refuse to practice.

18:22.485 --> 18:23.963
I couldn't wait to get rid of it.

18:23.965 --> 18:25.325
-I returned it.
-What?!

18:27.445 --> 18:30.043
Diana, we've always told you...

18:30.045 --> 18:31.923
if you ever come across
something magical...

18:31.925 --> 18:35.163
you should always, always,
try to understand it!

18:35.165 --> 18:37.683
-Honey, what is happening?
-It's Diana.

18:37.685 --> 18:39.723
She's discovered some magical book.

18:39.725 --> 18:41.923
That is not even why I called.
It's...

18:41.925 --> 18:44.045
It's what happened afterwards.

18:45.445 --> 18:47.245
I think... I think I saw Dad.

18:49.285 --> 18:53.083
-What do you mean, you saw your dad?
-He was just as I remembered him.

18:53.085 --> 18:55.283
What do you think it means?

18:55.285 --> 18:57.363
Well, honey, we're not
gonna know now, are we?

18:57.365 --> 19:01.523
You've given it back. Really, Diana,
it's time you faced what you are,

19:01.525 --> 19:04.083
a witch!
We've been over this, Sarah.

19:04.085 --> 19:05.885
I'm an historian, that's what I am.

19:07.005 --> 19:09.283
Oxford might offer me a professorship.

19:09.285 --> 19:12.523
Oh, honey!
That is wonderful news, Diana.

19:12.525 --> 19:14.403
Well, I don't have it yet.

19:14.405 --> 19:16.243
I have to get a paper written.

19:16.245 --> 19:18.563
Wait! Wait!
You can't just hide in your work.

19:18.565 --> 19:20.643
You saw your father.
This is important.

19:20.645 --> 19:23.643
If the book is bewitched, there's no
telling how you unlocked the spell.

19:23.645 --> 19:26.963
You have to take the book out again.
Work out what's going on.

19:26.965 --> 19:30.083
That may be what you would do, Sarah,
but I'm not you.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.805
I called for your advice,
not another lecture.

19:35.605 --> 19:38.003
Well, you know how
she feels about all this.

19:38.005 --> 19:40.285
Give her time to cool off, honey,
and try again.

19:45.525 --> 19:48.565
Y753 BCY?

19:49.565 --> 19:51.363
You say the car took off at speed.

19:51.365 --> 19:53.283
Are you sure that
registration number's right?

19:53.285 --> 19:54.605
Positive.

19:55.245 --> 19:57.925
I have very good eyesight.

19:59.525 --> 20:01.963
You say you left the hospital
at 5:30.

20:01.965 --> 20:05.323
But you didn't call
the incident in until 6:15.

20:05.325 --> 20:09.843
-I was giving him CPR.
-For over half an hour?

20:09.845 --> 20:13.685
Yes. I'm a doctor.
I was trying to save his life.

20:24.245 --> 20:25.885
Hey, Matthew.

20:36.685 --> 20:39.445
Think of the risks you took.
You could've been seen.

20:40.445 --> 20:43.363
James was my friend
and a brilliant doctor.

20:43.365 --> 20:46.043
I couldn't bear for all that
potential to go to waste.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.323
Did you even get his consent?

20:48.325 --> 20:50.243
Christ, Marcus!

20:50.245 --> 20:52.003
How many times do you have to be told?

20:52.005 --> 20:53.365
All right, I messed up.

20:57.445 --> 20:59.085
Why didn't it work?

21:02.605 --> 21:04.885
That's what we need to find out.

21:12.685 --> 21:16.083
-What's he doing here?
-Marcus is our new research subject.

21:16.085 --> 21:18.763
Another failed siring.

21:18.765 --> 21:22.085
Would you take his bloods and do
a cheek swab? Thank you, Miriam.

21:23.725 --> 21:25.045
Hello, Miriam.

21:26.045 --> 21:27.645
Hello, Marcus.

21:31.245 --> 21:32.645
I'll need that.

21:33.685 --> 21:35.763
And roll up your sleeve.

21:35.765 --> 21:37.843
I can take my own blood.

21:37.845 --> 21:39.885
Not in my lab, you can't.

21:49.605 --> 21:51.085
You should've told me.

21:52.565 --> 21:55.323
You knew that there'd been other
failed sirings, so why the secrecy?

21:55.325 --> 21:57.803
You're not meant to be siring anyway.

21:57.805 --> 22:00.965
Do I have to haul you both out of here
or can we finish our wine first?

22:04.765 --> 22:07.965
You know I didn't plan to sire James.

22:08.965 --> 22:11.123
If there had been more time,
I would have asked permission.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.923
And if I'd known
there was a risk of failure,

22:12.925 --> 22:14.765
I never would have attempted it.

22:15.925 --> 22:19.083
Matthew, his last moments

22:19.085 --> 22:22.563
were ugly, confused

22:22.565 --> 22:24.925
and desperate, but he didn't know why.

22:26.805 --> 22:29.003
I did that.

22:29.005 --> 22:32.365
He was my friend and I took
his death away from him for nothing.

22:39.085 --> 22:41.485
The reason I didn't tell you...

22:42.845 --> 22:45.403
is because we're all in the dark.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.723
We know there's a problem,
but we don't know the cause

22:47.725 --> 22:50.285
and that's the reason...

22:51.405 --> 22:53.005
that we need the book.

22:54.405 --> 22:58.125
Matthew thinks Ashmole 782
covers early creature history.

23:00.165 --> 23:02.083
It could help us
understand our evolution,

23:02.085 --> 23:03.683
our origins.

23:03.685 --> 23:07.323
The witches cannot be allowed
to have that information.

23:07.325 --> 23:10.285
Some would want to use that knowledge
to destroy us.

23:12.485 --> 23:14.323
So what do we do?

23:14.325 --> 23:16.965
I talk to Dr Bishop.

23:18.085 --> 23:20.085
And if need be...

23:21.085 --> 23:23.765
we take the book for ourselves.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.843
Notes and Queries?

23:55.845 --> 23:58.123
Notes and Queries?

23:58.125 --> 24:00.005
Where are you?

24:04.005 --> 24:05.325
Goddamn!

24:14.605 --> 24:16.285
Yours, I believe?

24:33.645 --> 24:35.485
That's a nasty burn.

24:37.965 --> 24:39.445
You're a vampire.

24:51.765 --> 24:53.403
Professor Clairmont.

24:53.405 --> 24:55.485
-Biochemistry.
-Dr Bishop.

24:56.685 --> 24:58.803
I found your article
on colour symbolism

24:58.805 --> 25:01.363
in alchemical transformation
fascinating,

25:01.365 --> 25:03.603
and your work on
Robert Boyle's approach

25:03.605 --> 25:07.685
to problems of expansion and
contraction quietly persuasive.

25:09.045 --> 25:15.725
You have a wonderful way
of evoking the past for the reader.

25:17.885 --> 25:19.363
Thank you.

25:19.365 --> 25:23.245
I'm hardly likely to forget you now,
after that.

25:24.405 --> 25:28.165
I didn't think that witches were
allowed to show their magic in public.

25:29.485 --> 25:31.643
I didn't mean for that to happen.

25:31.645 --> 25:33.923
Not in control of yourself, Dr Bishop?

25:33.925 --> 25:35.923
I'm perfectly in control.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.925
Thank you.

25:39.685 --> 25:42.003
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Professor Clairmont,

25:42.005 --> 25:44.565
I have to get back to my work.

26:20.765 --> 26:22.085
Focus.

26:24.485 --> 26:26.323
-Gillian.
-Sylvia.

26:26.325 --> 26:28.483
Is everything all right?

26:28.485 --> 26:32.885
The disturbance we all felt. Your
text said if anyone knew anything.

26:33.885 --> 26:35.205
Yes?

26:35.685 --> 26:37.685
I think maybe I do.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.615
Anything of interest?

27:29.775 --> 27:33.373
-You're following me.
-Well, we work in the same place.

27:33.375 --> 27:36.493
It's hardly strange that our paths
should cross again.

27:36.495 --> 27:38.813
You knew who I was yesterday.

27:38.815 --> 27:41.213
I'd call that a professional hazard.

27:41.215 --> 27:43.175
Your photograph's on the back
of all your books.

27:44.975 --> 27:47.093
Checked in with the staff at the Bod.

27:47.095 --> 27:48.893
You were in and out of there
in five minutes max.

27:48.895 --> 27:50.693
You were looking for me.

27:50.695 --> 27:52.773
Not because you enjoyed
my thesis on Robert Boyle.

27:52.775 --> 27:55.055
What do you want, Professor Clairmont?

27:56.215 --> 27:58.175
That's a fair question.

28:05.935 --> 28:08.853
You called up an Ashmole manuscript
earlier this week

28:08.855 --> 28:10.773
and something happened,

28:10.775 --> 28:13.053
something that disturbed you.

28:13.055 --> 28:14.455
Was it Ashmole 782?

28:17.135 --> 28:19.093
I'm assuming you used magic
to retrieve it.

28:19.095 --> 28:21.773
Why do you care?
Alchemy's not your area.

28:21.775 --> 28:24.613
This is about a great deal more
than just alchemy.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.055
Where's the manuscript now?

28:27.255 --> 28:29.895
Where it always is. You can't take
books out of the Bodleian.

28:32.775 --> 28:35.095
-Excuse me.
-Dr Bishop, please hear me out.

28:36.095 --> 28:38.453
No one has seen that book
for a very long time

28:38.455 --> 28:40.975
and it's not just me who wants it.
Word is spreading.

28:41.975 --> 28:43.453
It might be safer for you

28:43.455 --> 28:46.333
if the creatures of Oxford knew
that it was longer in your possession.

28:46.335 --> 28:48.733
Is that a threat?

28:48.735 --> 28:50.935
No. It's a warning.

28:52.135 --> 28:53.575
You need to be careful.

28:56.295 --> 28:57.615
I will be.

28:58.575 --> 29:00.895
Goodbye, Professor Clairmont.

29:44.175 --> 29:45.973
-Sean.
-Yeah?

29:45.975 --> 29:47.815
I need a drink.

29:56.175 --> 29:58.935
-For you.
-So now I know what you drink.

29:59.935 --> 30:02.253
I know what you read.

30:02.255 --> 30:04.773
Pretty much everything pre-1800.

30:04.775 --> 30:06.655
What else is there?

30:07.455 --> 30:09.613
Oh, come on.

30:09.615 --> 30:11.893
Family? Brothers, sisters?

30:11.895 --> 30:14.053
I'm an only child.

30:14.055 --> 30:18.853
I, er... I was actually raised
by my aunt and her partner.

30:18.855 --> 30:20.613
-Oh.
-Yeah.

30:20.615 --> 30:22.695
My parents died.

30:23.695 --> 30:25.295
Both of them?

30:26.295 --> 30:27.695
Car crash or something?

30:29.055 --> 30:31.855
They were, er... They were murdered.

30:34.415 --> 30:37.573
I shouldn't have asked. You
really don't have to talk about it.

30:37.575 --> 30:38.975
It's okay.

30:40.055 --> 30:43.253
They were on a research trip

30:43.255 --> 30:46.615
to a village
on the Ukraine-Russia border.

30:47.575 --> 30:51.215
We think the villagers turned on them.

30:52.095 --> 30:54.335
They thought that they...

30:55.415 --> 30:58.053
that they were witches.

30:58.055 --> 30:59.375
Witches?

31:00.375 --> 31:02.735
Some people still believe in witches.

31:03.735 --> 31:06.093
That magic is real.

31:06.095 --> 31:09.295
-They believe in other creatures too.
-Superstitious crap.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.493
I don't know how people
can still be so ignorant.

31:12.495 --> 31:14.575
We're living in the 21st century.

31:15.855 --> 31:18.095
I'm so sorry, Diana.

32:54.375 --> 32:57.293
No one's here.
The bed's still warm though.

32:57.295 --> 32:59.133
She can't be far away.

32:59.135 --> 33:01.135
We never are.

33:01.535 --> 33:03.055
Where'd you come from, witch?!

33:40.295 --> 33:41.775
I found him in the local pub.

33:43.175 --> 33:46.293
Told him about the witch in the woods.

33:46.295 --> 33:48.495
Humans and their prejudices.

33:50.455 --> 33:52.333
Tell me...

33:52.335 --> 33:54.335
are you always this assertive?

33:55.615 --> 33:57.175
The equinox gives me an edge.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.855
You've proven yourself
more than worthy, Satu.

34:04.855 --> 34:07.055
I shall take you to be sworn
into the congregation.

34:08.054 --> 34:10.572
But we have work to do first.

34:10.574 --> 34:13.132
There's been a disturbance.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.092
He's already put in his requests.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.572
These are his two.
Give them to him, will you?

34:16.574 --> 34:18.132
Sure.

34:18.135 --> 34:21.612
-Hey. What's going on?
-Hey. Some hotshot scientist

34:21.614 --> 34:23.533
has graced us with his presence.

34:23.534 --> 34:26.092
Sorry, he requested 83.

34:26.094 --> 34:28.293
Yours, Professor Clairmont.

34:28.295 --> 34:30.054
Thank you.

34:33.455 --> 34:34.775
Good morning.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.094
Professor Clairmont.

34:49.375 --> 34:51.853
I'm sorry, am I bothering you?

34:51.855 --> 34:53.175
No.

34:53.855 --> 34:57.655
I'm just surprised you find
a southern exposure comfortable.

34:59.335 --> 35:02.255
You don't believe
everything you read, do you?

35:04.295 --> 35:05.615
All right, then.

35:07.335 --> 35:09.655
I thought that you
might like some company.

35:13.015 --> 35:16.695
The library's busy today.
Quite a few witches here.

35:20.935 --> 35:22.255
You see?

35:27.175 --> 35:28.495
Hey.

35:31.015 --> 35:33.413
So what? They often work in here.

35:33.415 --> 35:37.175
They're here to watch you.

35:39.535 --> 35:43.293
I did warn you that other creatures
would take an interest in you.

35:43.295 --> 35:45.413
They're looking at me
because I'm talking to you.

35:45.415 --> 35:47.013
They are not the ones
with the problem.

35:47.015 --> 35:48.815
Do you mind?

35:52.735 --> 35:54.775
-Leaving so soon?
-Yeah.

36:04.575 --> 36:07.055
Hey!
Diana.

36:07.975 --> 36:11.775
-Hey.
-That was a vampire.

36:12.775 --> 36:16.013
-Yes, yeah.
-What was he doing in the library?

36:16.015 --> 36:18.293
I don't know any more than you do.

36:18.295 --> 36:20.613
But he talked to you.

36:20.615 --> 36:23.093
Yeah, he'd read my works.

36:23.095 --> 36:25.333
It's not a big deal.

36:25.335 --> 36:28.775
They're very dangerous and they
hate us as much as we hate them.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.413
Hopefully, he'll be gone by tomorrow.

36:32.415 --> 36:33.933
Yeah.

36:33.935 --> 36:36.653
-I'm going back to my rooms to work.
-Okay.

36:36.655 --> 36:38.015
Sure.

38:35.935 --> 38:41.413
Welcome to Oxford, Mr Knox. It's such
an honor to have you in our city.

38:41.415 --> 38:43.655
Come in. Don't linger out there.

38:45.735 --> 38:48.613
So, Miss Chamberlain.

38:48.615 --> 38:50.213
Hello.

38:50.215 --> 38:52.775
Please, sit down.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.973
Now, tell me exactly what happened?

38:59.975 --> 39:04.173
There was this Ashmole manuscript
in the Bodleian Library,

39:04.175 --> 39:06.293
-an alchemical one.
-Old?

39:06.295 --> 39:09.055
Medieval, two clasps,
distinctive binding.

39:11.455 --> 39:15.933
My friend took it out.

39:15.935 --> 39:17.533
If it's the book I think it is,

39:17.535 --> 39:20.773
then I've been looking for it
for a very long time.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.895
What's the name of your friend?

39:24.895 --> 39:26.375
You heard him.

39:27.495 --> 39:28.815
The name.

39:31.175 --> 39:32.655
Diana Bishop.

40:09.815 --> 40:13.615
Do you actually think it's safe
down here in the dark, Dr Bishop?

40:15.415 --> 40:16.895
Are you stalking me?

40:19.135 --> 40:23.215
I'm merely pointing out
that rowing on your own is a risk.

40:24.655 --> 40:28.775
So... The Book Of Life,
what did you do with it?

40:29.775 --> 40:31.373
I don't know what that is.

40:31.375 --> 40:33.495
A witch of your powers,
how could you not know?

40:35.695 --> 40:39.173
Just because you saw me in
the library. That was unusual for me.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.213
-I don't use magic.
-Don't lie to me, Diana.

40:41.215 --> 40:42.535
I can feel your power.

40:45.655 --> 40:47.893
If you want the book,
why don't you go get it?

40:47.895 --> 40:50.653
-I told you, I gave it back.
-I don't believe you.

40:50.655 --> 40:54.413
Okay, let's say I'm lying.
What are you going to do?

40:54.415 --> 40:57.135
Rip my head off
to get the truth out of me?

40:58.135 --> 40:59.455
I could.

41:01.735 --> 41:03.535
But it's not how I operate.

41:07.415 --> 41:10.255
I'm going to say this to you
one more time.

41:12.335 --> 41:14.375
I don't have your book.

41:17.295 --> 41:19.973
Ashmole 782 has been missing
for centuries

41:19.975 --> 41:24.175
and yet you were able to call it up.
Aren't you curious why?

41:25.335 --> 41:27.893
That book has never appeared to me
or anyone else,

41:27.895 --> 41:31.333
no matter what we've done.
Only to you.

41:31.335 --> 41:34.093
It could be the key to our survival,

41:34.095 --> 41:38.093
so isn't it strange that the only
creature who can summon it

41:38.095 --> 41:40.615
is a witch who can't
control her magic?

42:53.295 --> 42:55.135
Walk past me slowly.

42:56.615 --> 42:58.975
No sudden movement.

43:02.255 --> 43:03.575
Go!

43:06.095 --> 43:07.575
But don't run.

43:44.335 --> 43:45.893
What's going on?

43:45.895 --> 43:49.335
I came up here to get away
from a witch. I'm craving her.

43:51.655 --> 43:52.975
Good hunting.

43:54.095 --> 43:56.973
If you hurt her,
you'll never forgive yourself.

43:56.975 --> 44:00.373
Vampires abuse their longevity
to gain far too much control.

44:00.375 --> 44:04.975
This dead tourist is
a brazen vampire killing.

44:05.495 --> 44:08.413
-Other creatures will want the book.
-Why is it so important to you?

44:08.415 --> 44:11.615
It could tell us
how we created vampires.

44:12.615 --> 44:16.295
If we created them,
then we could uncreate them.
