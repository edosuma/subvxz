01:07.745 --> 01:09.114
- Hey!
- Hey, babe.

01:09.247 --> 01:11.049
I got lost.

01:11.183 --> 01:13.285
- I'm here now.
- It's fine.

01:14.785 --> 01:16.154
Yes!

01:16.654 --> 01:17.988
Neil!

01:30.569 --> 01:32.636
Hi, babe, it's good to see you!

02:43.108 --> 02:44.108
Hi.

02:48.046 --> 02:50.415
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Yeah.

02:51.216 --> 02:52.950
- Amazing.
- Of course.

02:53.552 --> 02:55.287
I'm trying to hide it
from my husband,

02:55.420 --> 02:57.888
and I can't carry a pack on me,
and I'm just dying for one.

02:58.089 --> 03:01.226
Thank you.
Also, everyone vapes, right?

03:01.359 --> 03:03.328
It's so hard to find anyone
with a cig...

03:06.997 --> 03:09.767
Thank you so much.

03:11.869 --> 03:13.205
Do you remember me?

03:15.706 --> 03:16.874
You don't, do you?

03:19.009 --> 03:21.079
No, I'm so sorry.
I don't. I, no, um...

03:21.379 --> 03:25.417
Was it... was it a book thing?

03:26.418 --> 03:29.054
It was in New York.
With a lot of my friends.

03:31.590 --> 03:35.826
No, I... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:36.827 --> 03:38.063
You don't know Simon?

03:38.729 --> 03:41.333
Simon... Oh! Simon Soga?

03:41.466 --> 03:45.170
Simon Brickner.
He, he brought you.

03:45.936 --> 03:47.771
<i>A bunch of my friends
were there.</i>

03:54.079 --> 03:55.189
And you're definitely not
getting me

03:55.213 --> 03:56.414
confused with someone else?

03:57.682 --> 03:59.016
No. No.

04:00.485 --> 04:02.753
You don't remember Simon?

04:04.855 --> 04:06.258
How is that possible?

04:07.858 --> 04:09.494
Was this, um...

04:11.496 --> 04:12.997
when I lost my dog?

04:14.232 --> 04:15.400
You lost your dog?

06:44.749 --> 06:46.016
<i>Do you forget all your works</i>

06:46.151 --> 06:47.318
<i>after you write them?</i>

06:52.857 --> 06:55.993
<i>"The more she listened,
the more Claire realized"</i>

06:56.127 --> 06:57.128
<i>it didn't matter.</i>

06:57.462 --> 06:59.030
<i>She simply did not speak</i>

06:59.164 --> 07:00.665
<i>"the language."</i>

07:00.931 --> 07:04.202
<i>"Does memory even matter?
Syntax or conjugations..."</i>

07:04.335 --> 07:05.936
<i>Comprehend that
now she is alone...</i>

07:06.070 --> 07:07.539
<i>There's a certain...</i>

07:07.772 --> 07:09.940
<i>"Except for the sounds
in room two, three, four..."</i>

07:29.394 --> 07:30.671
Hey, uh,
can I help you find something?

07:30.695 --> 07:32.263
No. No, just...

08:25.083 --> 08:26.784
Two dollars. Sorry.

09:05.123 --> 09:07.525
<i>May I help you?</i>

09:08.893 --> 09:10.228
<i>May I help you?</i>

09:11.329 --> 09:13.064
<i>No response. Thank you.</i>

09:13.197 --> 09:14.465
<i>You're welcome, ma'am.</i>

09:14.599 --> 09:16.367
<i>All right, goodb...</i>

10:20.898 --> 10:23.434
<i>He was really conservative...</i>

10:36.981 --> 10:38.316
So, like, so important...

10:40.052 --> 10:41.152
Yeah...

10:42.054 --> 10:43.221
She's bisexual...

10:43.521 --> 10:45.124
<i>In middle school,
I was the herb,</i>

10:45.256 --> 10:48.826
<i>and then high school came,
and, like, everything changed.</i>

10:49.193 --> 10:52.131
That's when, like, everybody
wanted to start talking to me,

10:52.397 --> 10:54.033
and all of that. It all changed.

10:54.599 --> 10:56.135
But that was
going towards, like...

10:56.267 --> 10:58.403
when I hit
my sophomore year, like,

10:58.603 --> 10:59.971
I got poppin', like,

11:00.571 --> 11:03.441
well, I'm not saying that I'm like,
you know, poppin' or anything.

11:03.574 --> 11:05.977
I'm just saying,
people wanted to talk to me

11:06.377 --> 11:07.545
and stuff.

11:32.737 --> 11:35.540
<i>- Do you believe in God?
- No.</i>

11:37.642 --> 11:39.844
Have you been in love?

11:40.611 --> 11:41.412
Yes.

11:41.612 --> 11:43.115
Are you in love now?

11:43.481 --> 11:45.249
Probably, and it's horrible.

11:46.718 --> 11:48.120
Why is it horrible?

11:48.653 --> 11:52.091
Um, because instead of it being
all, like, sunshine and rainbows,

11:52.223 --> 11:56.195
it's more of, like, a black hole
in the middle of nowhere

11:56.327 --> 11:57.607
that you can't
really get out of,

11:57.729 --> 11:59.289
and then
when you are getting out of it,

11:59.330 --> 12:01.799
you slip back deeper
into the hole.

12:02.366 --> 12:03.568
Yeah.

12:05.636 --> 12:07.139
<i>That's really awful.</i>

12:08.107 --> 12:09.974
<i>But have you ever been
in love before?</i>

12:12.844 --> 12:15.413
<i>Yeah, I think so. I, um...</i>

12:19.218 --> 12:20.651
<i>You know, I don't know. I...</i>

12:22.687 --> 12:24.522
<i>I don't actually remember that.</i>

13:30.421 --> 13:31.789
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:32.124 --> 13:33.324
Are you Jewish?

13:34.559 --> 13:36.594
- Are you Jewish?
- Huh?

13:36.727 --> 13:38.096
Are you Jewish, ma'am?

13:38.663 --> 13:40.165
- Are you Jewish?
- I don't know.

13:40.865 --> 13:43.768
- What's... What?
- I d... I don't know.

13:44.169 --> 13:45.369
Are you Jewish?

13:46.404 --> 13:48.005
I don't know. I don't know.

13:48.140 --> 13:49.674
Have a... Have a good night.

13:49.807 --> 13:51.409
Have a good night.

14:21.405 --> 14:25.077
Call and ask if they
can cut me a break, please.

14:27.312 --> 14:29.314
Damn, it's...
It's really like that.

14:29.447 --> 14:30.514
It's a cold world.

14:31.083 --> 14:33.484
Never forget, man.
It's a cold world.

14:35.853 --> 14:38.956
Excuse me, Miss.
Sorry to bother you.

14:46.031 --> 14:49.400
Um, would you like to buy
any of these hot dogs?

14:50.369 --> 14:52.304
- Uh-uh.
- No?

14:52.703 --> 14:56.707
Okay. Like, I'm not
a hot dog enthusiast.

14:56.841 --> 14:58.801
I'm not out here trying to buy
a billion hot dogs.

14:58.910 --> 15:00.478
It's a credit card minimum.

15:01.479 --> 15:02.747
No.

15:03.315 --> 15:05.750
Yeah, they wouldn't let me
get just two. It's ridiculous.

15:06.385 --> 15:07.585
Sorry.

15:08.419 --> 15:10.222
Damn, you're killin' me. Okay.

15:10.755 --> 15:16.194
Um... how about I'll give you
a hot dog for free.

15:16.361 --> 15:17.561
And at the end,

15:17.895 --> 15:20.198
you'll want to pay me
because they're so savory.

15:20.598 --> 15:23.135
I, I think I'm vegetarian.

15:23.467 --> 15:26.171
- Oh, you a vegetarian?
- Yeah.

15:26.504 --> 15:27.638
Oh, damn. Okay.

15:28.173 --> 15:29.783
That's pretty cool that
you're a vegetarian.

15:29.807 --> 15:31.310
I think I'm gluten intolerant,

15:31.676 --> 15:33.111
and I just come here, like...

15:33.245 --> 15:34.812
I know I'm not supposed
to eat the buns,

15:34.946 --> 15:36.881
but I eat the buns anyway, man.
They're too good.

15:39.517 --> 15:42.087
Yo... if you're vegetarian,

15:42.220 --> 15:44.488
why are you eating
at Papaya Dog?

15:45.424 --> 15:46.624
Um...

15:48.592 --> 15:50.395
I just wanted to take a break,

15:50.528 --> 15:51.996
but don't tell them.

15:54.399 --> 15:58.502
I won't tell him.

16:04.209 --> 16:06.677
Why, why...
What do you even put on those?

16:06.811 --> 16:09.880
'Cause they look,
like, very dry.

16:10.349 --> 16:13.851
I put on ketchup and mustard.

16:14.186 --> 16:17.655
That's how I roll. My momma,
my brother, my sister,

16:17.922 --> 16:19.091
they just put ketchup.

16:19.224 --> 16:20.992
Conformists.
Can't fuck with them.

16:21.926 --> 16:23.095
What about your dad?

16:24.363 --> 16:26.497
Man, I don't even want to talk
about my dad, man.

16:26.630 --> 16:27.631
He's an asshole.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.934
Because of what he puts
on hot dogs?

16:30.202 --> 16:32.937
Not because of what
he puts on his hot dogs, man.

16:33.071 --> 16:36.108
Like, I, I wish it was 'cause
of what he put on his hot dogs.

16:36.974 --> 16:39.044
I can't even start, like...

16:39.577 --> 16:41.179
He's just an asshole, man.

16:42.114 --> 16:43.181
That's terrible.

16:44.882 --> 16:46.418
I appreciate you saying that.

16:47.219 --> 16:49.421
I don't really want
to be in that space right now.

16:49.687 --> 16:52.190
Uh, you want to pay me
for these hot dogs?

16:53.125 --> 16:54.125
No.

16:54.493 --> 16:56.395
Yo, but you were,
you were just playing with it.

16:56.527 --> 16:59.097
You were touching it.
You're killing the resale.

16:59.530 --> 17:00.731
No

17:01.599 --> 17:03.201
No? Mmm.

17:03.768 --> 17:05.970
You want to
buy some weed off me?

17:07.671 --> 17:08.671
No.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.941
Uh, do you want to smoke
some weed with me?

17:15.713 --> 17:17.049
Okay, I respect that.

17:17.315 --> 17:21.786
Um, I'm getting out of here.
Uh, wanna come with me?

17:26.656 --> 17:27.825
Okay.

17:28.659 --> 17:31.329
All right, cool. Cool!
Damn. Okay.

17:32.364 --> 17:33.564
Very cool.

17:33.931 --> 17:35.800
But you've left your hot dogs.

17:36.101 --> 17:38.669
I'm a vegetarian now.
You've inspired me.

17:43.908 --> 17:45.709
And gluten intolerant.

17:46.411 --> 17:47.645
And gluten intolerant.

17:48.113 --> 17:50.014
I, I'm just all of it.
I can't eat anything.

17:50.148 --> 17:51.982
I'm slowly starving to death.

18:02.127 --> 18:04.296
- Do you have any siblings?
- I don't know.

18:05.596 --> 18:07.165
What? You don't know?

18:07.332 --> 18:08.567
Uhm-hm.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.168
What is...

18:10.302 --> 18:12.337
Maybe, maybe you have some
long-lost siblings

18:12.471 --> 18:13.471
who you don't know.

18:13.604 --> 18:15.840
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

18:16.308 --> 18:19.411
Maybe I do too,
'cause my dad was fuckin' horny.

18:19.777 --> 18:21.645
- What?
- My dad was horny.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.248
Horny as in, like...?

18:23.381 --> 18:25.283
He's covered in horns.
He's very sharp.

18:25.417 --> 18:26.617
You can't get near him.

18:27.252 --> 18:29.397
Oh, so you mean, like,
maybe he's got off with other people?

18:29.421 --> 18:31.123
Yeah, he's got off
with other people.

18:35.826 --> 18:36.894
You're very warm world.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.430
What is warm world?

18:38.796 --> 18:40.398
Warm world is like, um...

18:41.399 --> 18:43.535
that's like the words,
"I love you."

18:44.202 --> 18:46.104
It's like, like saying,
"I love you."

18:46.438 --> 18:48.906
That's, that's a good example
of something warm world.

18:49.207 --> 18:52.277
Or, you had a bad day,
why'd you have a bad day?

18:52.910 --> 18:56.481
Or when a, like,
a polar bear, like,

18:57.082 --> 18:59.184
nests her cubs, and, like...

18:59.518 --> 19:00.885
makes sure they're warm.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.721
- That's warm world.
- Oh, my God. That's great.

19:03.854 --> 19:05.257
There's an opposite
of that, too.

19:05.524 --> 19:06.625
Hmm?

19:06.824 --> 19:08.460
- Cold world.
- What's cold world?

19:08.659 --> 19:12.030
Cold world is, like,
"Yo, are you cryin'?"

19:12.164 --> 19:13.764
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

19:13.898 --> 19:15.534
"Man the fuck up.
Why are you crying?"

19:15.666 --> 19:17.035
Cold world is like...

19:17.502 --> 19:19.222
<i>The next uptown
local train is now arriving.</i>

19:19.337 --> 19:21.906
It's like a boot stepping
on another person's face.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.375
- A what?
- A boot.

19:23.508 --> 19:25.243
- What's a boo?
- It's like a heavy shoe.

19:25.477 --> 19:28.113
- Like a big shoe.
- A... Oh, shoe!

19:28.547 --> 19:30.915
You've gotta say the "T", man.
Otherwise, I didn't get it.

19:31.049 --> 19:32.950
- A boot.
- A boot.

19:42.060 --> 19:43.894
Thirty-fourth Street.

19:52.671 --> 19:53.804
Thanks.

19:57.542 --> 19:58.842
Appreciate.

19:59.644 --> 20:00.844
Fine.

20:02.647 --> 20:07.252
I do feel like I just need
to find this girl, though.

20:12.090 --> 20:14.559
- I need to find someone.
- Yo...

20:15.227 --> 20:18.296
Oh, dear. I need to find...
I need to find a girl.

20:19.030 --> 20:21.066
- I need to find this girl.
- Hey, hey, hey.

20:21.199 --> 20:23.235
- We can fin...
- What? Don't touch... Don't.

20:28.273 --> 20:30.075
Was it something I said, man?

20:37.915 --> 20:39.517
Did I say something wrong?

20:41.219 --> 20:43.431
It's just a little weird
that you need to find some girl.

20:43.455 --> 20:44.455
It's not weird.

20:46.757 --> 20:48.093
Let's just keep walking, okay?

20:48.792 --> 20:50.228
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.535
Where are we going again?

20:57.702 --> 21:00.171
Uh, we're going to my
hiding spot for my weed,

21:00.305 --> 21:01.805
'cause my mom searches my room.

21:02.006 --> 21:03.006
Where is it?

21:03.508 --> 21:05.043
Where is it?
You'll see. You'll see.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.944
We're really close, actually.

22:05.537 --> 22:08.206
<i>So many people tell me
the exact same thing.</i>

22:10.608 --> 22:13.111
<i>- And what? What's that?
- I don't know.</i>

22:13.244 --> 22:15.080
It's just a little bit
beyond my grasp,

22:15.213 --> 22:16.213
every single time.

22:16.281 --> 22:17.515
But you're close, though.

22:17.649 --> 22:18.750
I'm so close.

22:18.982 --> 22:20.218
Yeah, I so identify with that.

22:20.352 --> 22:22.620
I think it's all just beyond my
grasp too,

22:22.754 --> 22:24.474
and I feel like I'm just
about to get there,

22:24.589 --> 22:28.159
and then it just...
yeah, it slips away.

22:29.327 --> 22:32.030
You don't have it.

22:38.770 --> 22:39.970
<i>I don't.</i>

22:41.506 --> 22:43.775
<i>Nah, but nobody really
has it forever.</i>

22:55.919 --> 22:59.557
<i>I don't remember who I am...</i>

23:02.527 --> 23:04.462
<i>or where I'm supposed to go.</i>

23:11.603 --> 23:12.970
<i>And all of my memories</i>

23:13.471 --> 23:16.940
<i>begin with me walking
among these people, and...</i>

23:19.144 --> 23:21.513
<i>and I don't want anyone
to know that.</i>

23:38.996 --> 23:41.266
Closed. Closed.

23:46.171 --> 23:47.705
- No?
- We're closed..

24:13.198 --> 24:14.265
Hello, how are you?

24:14.399 --> 24:15.667
Hi. Some hot water.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.670
Hot water? How are you, good?

24:26.110 --> 24:29.147
That $2.50, please. $2.50.

24:31.282 --> 24:33.818
- Oh, I've left my bag at the...
- Huh?

24:34.419 --> 24:37.822
I've left my, my bag at the...

24:39.157 --> 24:41.092
What do you mean
you left your bag over there?

24:41.226 --> 24:43.103
- Why you come if you have no bag?
- I'll come back in a minute.

24:43.127 --> 24:45.372
Can you just gi... 'Cause you
put the water in it now. Can...

24:45.396 --> 24:47.636
I know I put the water,
but why you don't told me before?

24:47.699 --> 24:49.299
- Before I opened it?
- Because I forgot.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.212
I'm really hungry.
I haven't eaten. Can I please...

24:51.236 --> 24:52.871
Everybody's saying
the same thing.

24:53.438 --> 24:55.749
I mean, it's only going to waste if I
go back and come back, and I won't...

24:55.773 --> 24:57.733
I know,
But you should tell me before I opened it.

24:58.309 --> 25:00.521
I know, but I live around the corner.
I'll bring it... I'll bring it in a second.

25:00.545 --> 25:02.623
- This is the first time I know you.
- I'm really hungry.

25:02.647 --> 25:04.482
- No, I can't do it.
- I haven't eaten today,

25:04.883 --> 25:06.494
so can you please just... If you're
not going to give it to anyone else...

25:06.518 --> 25:07.928
You should've told me
before I opened it. No.

25:07.952 --> 25:09.712
You see what you did?
Go bring and come back.

26:22.360 --> 26:23.861
<i>Okay, so, like...</i>

26:24.095 --> 26:25.530
It's me, like,

26:25.830 --> 26:29.400
I'm afraid I'm gonna be
addicted to, like, substances...

26:30.134 --> 26:31.469
like, that are bad.

26:31.669 --> 26:34.305
Like, I don't know, like alcohol
and stuff like that.

26:34.439 --> 26:36.075
Like, I'm afraid
I'm gonna do that.

26:36.507 --> 26:39.110
Um. Yeah,
that's why I'm trying to live...

26:39.477 --> 26:40.645
Carefree.

26:41.312 --> 26:43.190
Yeah, I'm trying to... Um, yeah.
I don't think about that often,

26:43.214 --> 26:48.019
but you know... I, like, stay
away from drinking and stuff.

26:49.054 --> 26:51.255
Is that because of
something in your history?

26:51.990 --> 26:55.593
Yeah, 'cause, like,
family stuff. Yeah.

26:56.095 --> 26:57.428
Aw, I'm sorry.

26:58.863 --> 27:01.666
Yeah. I mean, what can you do?
I mean, it's not like...

27:01.866 --> 27:03.568
I mean,
it's not my fault, but...

27:03.701 --> 27:04.769
Like...

27:05.570 --> 27:08.415
Like, I know, like, I know a lot of
people who met in high school and stuff.

27:08.439 --> 27:09.907
I guess, it's more just, like,

27:10.042 --> 27:12.810
I just haven't, like,
felt that way ever.

27:12.944 --> 27:14.812
I don't know. I think
the reason why is 'cause,

27:14.946 --> 27:17.215
like, if love is, like,
a one in a million thing

27:17.348 --> 27:20.551
and I've met 20 people, then,
like, my odds are, like, slim.

27:20.785 --> 27:22.429
So, maybe it'll happen
when I go to college.

27:22.453 --> 27:23.821
- Yeah.
- Or, like...

27:23.955 --> 27:26.257
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, okay. Thank you.

27:26.391 --> 27:29.061
Um, no, I don't know...

27:30.161 --> 27:32.697
Do you ever wish
you could change something

27:32.830 --> 27:33.831
about yourself?

27:34.832 --> 27:35.833
I guess...

27:37.468 --> 27:39.771
my talents or my ambitions.

27:39.904 --> 27:41.572
So what are your talents
and ambitions?

27:41.773 --> 27:44.642
I like, you know, like
artsy types of stuff.

27:45.009 --> 27:49.714
My family's a very career,
like, driven, li...

27:49.847 --> 27:52.517
engineering, medical school
type of family,

27:52.650 --> 27:55.420
so if I could have that
type of interest

27:55.553 --> 27:57.193
in my life,
that would make things easier.

27:57.221 --> 27:58.999
So you wish that you
were interested in engineering,

27:59.023 --> 28:02.293
but wouldn't you wish that your
parents would be the one

28:02.493 --> 28:04.328
- to change what they think?
- Yeah.

28:04.495 --> 28:06.497
Oh, wait.

28:06.664 --> 28:10.234
That makes way more sense.
That makes way more sense.

29:00.551 --> 29:03.454
- Hi. Um, I'm staying here.
- Oh.

29:03.588 --> 29:04.889
I was staying here last night.

29:05.022 --> 29:06.791
Fantastic. I hope you
had a comfortable stay.

29:06.924 --> 29:09.161
Yeah, no, it was, it was,
it was, uh, it was lovely,

29:09.293 --> 29:13.998
but I just, I've, um, I've
mis... I've misplaced my key.

29:15.067 --> 29:17.268
Okay. Um, what room is it?

29:17.902 --> 29:19.437
Uh, it's 234.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.707
And, uh, what's your name?

29:23.941 --> 29:25.676
No, my name isn't
on the reservation.

29:25.810 --> 29:27.411
Whose name
is on the reservation?

29:27.545 --> 29:29.313
I don't know that, actually.

29:29.547 --> 29:31.116
Okay, uh, I can help. Um...

29:31.282 --> 29:32.483
Well, just give me a name.

29:32.950 --> 29:35.150
Can you just... Do you mind
if you just give me the key?

29:36.020 --> 29:38.523
You seem legit.
I want to help you.

29:38.756 --> 29:40.925
I just legally, I can't just...

29:41.425 --> 29:42.760
Uh...

29:45.963 --> 29:47.032
Miss?

32:16.614 --> 32:20.352
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you.
Sorry, um,

32:20.484 --> 32:22.520
are you Alina Reynolds,
by any chance?

32:24.056 --> 32:26.590
- Yes.
- Yes. Cool.

32:26.724 --> 32:28.360
You had me in suspense
for a moment. I...

32:28.626 --> 32:31.029
- No, sorry, I don't...
- I've seen you. Uh, sorry.

32:31.229 --> 32:34.598
I'm a big fan of your work.
That's a, I saw you at the...

32:34.732 --> 32:36.467
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah,

32:36.767 --> 32:39.670
I saw you at a reading, like,
two years ago, a, at Greened-Eyed books,

32:39.837 --> 32:41.973
- for, um, <i>Italian Studies.</i>
- God, yes.

32:42.107 --> 32:45.009
I, yeah. I'm just, I,
It was awesome to see you then.

32:45.143 --> 32:46.877
It's awesome
to see you now. I, like,

32:47.011 --> 32:48.946
that book changed how I thought.

32:49.081 --> 32:50.991
- Mmm.
- It's such a cliché, but it changed what I thought,

32:51.015 --> 32:52.883
like, short stories could do.

32:53.017 --> 32:54.652
You know
all of them well, or, um...

32:54.785 --> 32:57.322
Um, yeah. I probably know them
a bit too, too well.

32:57.456 --> 32:59.566
- I've read, I've read it, like, a bunch of times.
- Mmm.

32:59.590 --> 33:00.858
Well, that's more than I have.

33:02.827 --> 33:05.830
Yeah, I mean, I really love
the whole, like, universe you create

33:05.963 --> 33:10.102
- and how they weave together, and it's, like, very beautiful.
- Mmm.

33:10.868 --> 33:12.837
Are you working
on anything new right now?

33:12.970 --> 33:13.970
Um...

33:15.140 --> 33:16.640
- Yes.
- Yeah?

33:16.874 --> 33:19.177
- Yes, I am.
- Short stories? A novel?

33:19.311 --> 33:20.787
- An autobiographical?
- It's a novel.

33:20.811 --> 33:22.214
- Yeah. Mmm.
- Oh, okay.

33:22.347 --> 33:25.117
It'll be great to read you
in that long of form.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.485
Oh, that's nice.

33:27.018 --> 33:31.522
Is, is it sort of also a bildungsroman?
Coming of age kind of...

33:32.023 --> 33:33.791
- Yep. It is.
- Yeah?

33:33.924 --> 33:35.926
It's about, um, a, a young boy.

33:36.061 --> 33:38.497
- Uh-huh.
- See, who, uh, he really loves hot dogs.

33:38.662 --> 33:41.376
He has this real thing about hot dogs, but he's
just developed this gluten intolerance, so...

33:41.400 --> 33:43.667
I mean, no, that's just,
that's how it starts.

33:43.801 --> 33:45.536
- Okay. Tragic for him...
- Uh...

33:45.836 --> 33:48.049
But, yeah, yeah. And he's, you know,
he's fallen out with his parents.

33:48.073 --> 33:51.043
He's, like, really, his mom doesn't
want him to smoke so much weed.

33:51.176 --> 33:52.576
- It's, you know, it's...
- Right.

33:53.245 --> 33:55.180
So hot dogs can be
kind of a coping mechanism.

33:55.380 --> 33:58.383
I mean, the, and he's just
doing dogs and no buns, huh?

33:58.783 --> 34:01.153
Yeah.
That's a good line, actually.

34:01.286 --> 34:02.887
I could use that.

34:03.020 --> 34:06.224
My ex was gluten intolerant,

34:06.358 --> 34:09.927
and otherwise, very tolerant
as a person, but a celiac,

34:10.062 --> 34:13.630
and I gave her
my copy of <i>Italian Studies.</i>

34:13.864 --> 34:15.132
Have not had it returned,

34:15.900 --> 34:18.645
but I lost all my marginalia,
and all of the notes that I had marked up

34:18.668 --> 34:23.341
with your, just, you know,
and every, every story was...

34:50.335 --> 34:51.802
<i>"If only she could understand"</i>

34:51.936 --> 34:54.106
<i>the sounds coming from room 234,</i>

34:54.772 --> 34:58.343
<i>but the more she listened,
the more Claire realized</i>

34:58.477 --> 34:59.544
<i>it didn't matter.</i>

34:59.977 --> 35:02.314
<i>She simply did not
speak the language.</i>

35:03.614 --> 35:05.117
<i>Claire had the door slammed.</i>

35:07.017 --> 35:08.487
<i>For now, she was alone,</i>

35:08.986 --> 35:11.822
<i>"except for the sounds
in room 234."</i>

35:26.238 --> 35:29.341
Excuse me. Have
you got a pen I could borrow?

35:31.176 --> 35:32.176
Thanks

35:45.090 --> 35:46.424
Excuse me.

35:49.060 --> 35:51.729
- That's a library book.
- Yeah.

35:54.032 --> 35:55.567
I'm sorry, what are you doing?

35:55.699 --> 35:57.102
I'm just signing it.

35:59.904 --> 36:01.705
- Did you write it?
- Yeah.

36:02.274 --> 36:04.942
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Well, good for you.

36:05.110 --> 36:06.944
Thanks.
It's actually, it's actually,

36:07.179 --> 36:09.013
it's not bad, actually.
It's quite good.

36:09.147 --> 36:10.615
I'm sure it's a beautiful book.

36:10.781 --> 36:12.261
I believe you,
and I'm not. I'm not...

36:12.350 --> 36:14.718
This is not to derogate
your book at all, it's just...

36:14.885 --> 36:16.354
The library
is a common resource.

36:16.488 --> 36:19.924
Exactly, yeah. And I'm
just adding to the library.

36:20.058 --> 36:22.026
It's not your book
or my book, it's our book.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.694
I'm making it better
for the library.

36:23.827 --> 36:25.307
The library...
library's for everyone.

36:25.863 --> 36:27.065
Oh. Well, good for you.

36:27.199 --> 36:28.442
Make a splendid edition
to the library...

36:28.466 --> 36:30.035
Sir, shh. Keep your voice down.

36:30.868 --> 36:32.070
Library.

36:33.205 --> 36:35.440
You're a gem.

36:36.274 --> 36:40.679
You know, you're cold world.
You are cold world.

36:41.146 --> 36:42.347
A signed book is warm world.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.948
- I'm warm world.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

36:44.082 --> 36:46.016
I overreacted. Forgive me.

36:46.284 --> 36:47.284
I'm, uh...

36:47.619 --> 36:49.521
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

36:49.654 --> 36:50.754
Mmm. Yeah.

36:50.888 --> 36:52.290
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

<i>"She searched for Lucinda,"</i>

40:01.279 --> 40:04.249
<i>the singer who had so
entranced her at the concert,</i>

40:05.350 --> 40:08.952
<i>but no one seemed to know who
she was, or even remember her.</i>

40:10.121 --> 40:13.991
<i>"But maybe it didn't matter.
Even the search was fulfilling."</i>

40:24.235 --> 40:25.670
He forgot the password.

40:25.804 --> 40:27.515
He made it so many times
that I don't remember

40:27.539 --> 40:29.040
what the password...

40:29.174 --> 40:31.676
Oh, my God! Can I see it?

40:39.184 --> 40:40.852
I met this kid from Texas
yesterday.

40:40.984 --> 40:42.520
I want to go to Texas so bad,

40:42.687 --> 40:45.290
because there'd be a lot of
other people that are like me,

40:45.423 --> 40:46.491
but...

40:47.225 --> 40:48.402
He think's there'd be a lot
of other people like you in Texas?

40:48.426 --> 40:49.427
- Yeah.
- Why?

40:49.694 --> 40:51.329
I don't know.

40:51.563 --> 40:53.798
He said that, and I was just,
like, that's interesting.

40:53.932 --> 40:55.667
What's a person like you?

40:57.936 --> 41:02.140
I'm open
to try different things.

41:03.107 --> 41:04.309
That's what I think.

41:05.844 --> 41:07.045
Yeah.

41:07.846 --> 41:09.180
I want to be a person like you.

41:09.447 --> 41:10.748
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:10.949 --> 41:12.015
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:12.183 --> 41:13.585
That makes me feel good.

41:13.718 --> 41:14.853
Good.

41:14.985 --> 41:16.321
I never heard that before.

42:19.951 --> 42:21.185
Simon.

42:25.523 --> 42:26.523
Hi.

42:36.634 --> 42:38.002
Have you ever been in love?

42:38.236 --> 42:40.572
Yeah. Yeah.

42:42.473 --> 42:46.045
I saw her the first time at camp
and my jaw dropped.

42:46.244 --> 42:47.478
It was...

42:47.645 --> 42:50.448
I had crushes,
but I never knew what lo...

42:50.582 --> 42:52.784
I saw her the first time,
I was, like, oh...

42:53.785 --> 42:54.785
She was all alone.

42:55.253 --> 42:58.756
It was raining, and I was,
like, "Hey, do you draw?"

42:58.890 --> 43:00.834
And I guessed that she drew,
'cause she had short hair.

43:00.858 --> 43:02.460
And I got kicked out
of that camp,

43:02.760 --> 43:04.905
but before, right before I got
kicked out, I came up to her

43:04.929 --> 43:06.774
because we didn't really talk,
but we were interested in each other,

43:06.798 --> 43:08.933
and I was, like,
"Yo, I'm getting kicked out,

43:09.267 --> 43:10.868
but, like, keep doing you."

43:11.002 --> 43:13.171
And then when the program
was over, she hit me up,

43:13.638 --> 43:17.542
and we hung out once the first
time, and my mom left,

43:17.909 --> 43:20.378
and she said her dad died,

43:20.511 --> 43:25.016
and she, we met the first time,
and she told me the story of her life.

43:25.149 --> 43:26.150
It was tragic,

43:26.517 --> 43:28.853
and I just wanted to protect her

43:28.987 --> 43:30.655
and give her blankets
and chicken soup.

43:31.022 --> 43:33.558
And my mom left,
and we were in the kitchen,

43:33.691 --> 43:35.426
and I was, like,
"Can I kiss you?"

43:35.893 --> 43:39.931
And I, then we kissed. And then we...

43:40.198 --> 43:41.666
We did things. And that was fun,

43:41.899 --> 43:44.219
'cause I'd never really done
those things before, you know?

43:47.405 --> 43:49.507
She's going away, though.

43:50.042 --> 43:51.043
She's going to college.

43:51.943 --> 43:53.845
I'm not going to college,
'cause my parents,

43:53.978 --> 43:54.978
they think I'm a bum.

44:00.618 --> 44:01.986
It's just one thing...

44:02.620 --> 44:05.857
When people are special, everyone
tries to get their grubby hands on them

44:06.157 --> 44:08.726
and take some of their,
their warmth and their love,

44:08.860 --> 44:10.062
you know what I mean?

44:10.194 --> 44:11.429
You think I'm special?

44:11.763 --> 44:13.631
Yeah, I think
you're very obviously special.

44:14.099 --> 44:15.266
Why?

44:15.566 --> 44:17.735
Because you came with me.
And nobody would.

44:17.935 --> 44:19.604
This is a violation
of social norms,

44:19.737 --> 44:21.116
<i>but you didn't give a fuck
about any of that.</i>

44:21.140 --> 44:22.407
Come on!

44:22.607 --> 44:23.941
<i>So I respect that, like, a lot.</i>

44:24.109 --> 44:25.144
<i>I really do.</i>

44:25.276 --> 44:26.544
Oh...

44:31.816 --> 44:33.484
<i>So I'm writing this book.</i>

44:33.651 --> 44:35.496
<i>Uh, no, I've written a book.</i>
I've written a novel,

44:35.520 --> 44:37.156
<i>a collection of short stories,</i>

44:37.288 --> 44:40.491
<i>and, uh, there's one about
a motel and, like, a girl there,</i>

44:40.625 --> 44:43.327
<i>and one about
a girl stuck on a rollercoaster,</i>

44:44.195 --> 44:45.830
and it's mainly
about young people,

44:45.963 --> 44:48.599
and, like, overcoming fear
and weird repressed memories,

44:48.733 --> 44:52.804
but I'm now writing
a, a, a novel,

44:53.038 --> 44:54.939
and it's about teenagers.

44:55.273 --> 44:56.974
- Cool.
- Yeah.

44:57.709 --> 45:02.680
So I just, what I need is
to hang out with some teens.

45:03.182 --> 45:04.315
All right.

45:04.849 --> 45:05.849
Good.

45:28.372 --> 45:30.942
No, my biggest fear, I think,
I think about this sometimes,

45:31.076 --> 45:33.711
is I meet a person I like,
and then I invite them to a party,

45:33.845 --> 45:37.882
but there is no party
and they come.

45:38.015 --> 45:40.055
It's just me, and they're like,
"Where's the party?"

45:40.119 --> 45:44.555
And they have expectations coming
in and they see me in my state,

45:44.689 --> 45:46.290
and I think about this,
and also, like,

45:46.424 --> 45:49.128
dropping a baby in a river is,
like, my second biggest fear.

45:50.995 --> 45:52.473
And did you think there
was ever going to be a party?

45:52.497 --> 45:54.999
No, no. There's no party.

45:55.167 --> 45:58.036
Someone handed me their baby,
and I dropped it in a river.

45:58.170 --> 46:00.271
What? No, I mean
with the person you invited?

46:00.404 --> 46:02.540
Oh! No. No,

46:02.673 --> 46:06.073
there something that tells me, something
inside me tells me to invite them to a party,

46:06.178 --> 46:08.247
and I do, and then
I don't have a party,

46:08.379 --> 46:10.048
and then there's just me
and this person,

46:10.215 --> 46:12.455
and they come to my house,
and they see there's no party,

46:12.550 --> 46:15.953
and also, I'm a liar,
and also, I'm a weirdo.

46:16.788 --> 46:18.656
<i>So if you wanted to get
to know somebody,</i>

46:18.790 --> 46:20.092
<i>what would you ask?</i>

46:20.424 --> 46:22.527
<i>Uh, like,
"What's your favorite thing?"</i>

46:22.660 --> 46:25.329
<i>And then, like, the first three
things that pop into your head.</i>

46:25.563 --> 46:27.465
And what are your
favorite things?

46:27.665 --> 46:32.737
Um, well, I've thought about it a lot,
so it's not off, just off the noggin,

46:35.640 --> 46:37.642
but, um, uh, like, dogs,
and trees,

46:37.775 --> 46:41.579
and, um,
hugging people I care about.

46:44.649 --> 46:46.584
- That's beautiful.
- Thanks.

46:46.784 --> 46:49.487
It's fun, 'cause the word "bark"

46:49.620 --> 46:51.589
applies to dogs and trees,

46:51.722 --> 46:53.491
so it's, like, my favorite word.

46:53.958 --> 46:56.494
It's not, actually,
but, like, it's cool.

46:57.062 --> 46:59.198
You know, <i>I don't want</i>
<i>to be seen as someone</i>

46:59.330 --> 47:02.267
<i>who engages in the power dynamics
that boys do, like, you know...</i>

47:02.667 --> 47:05.469
But then, then again,
there's something so cute and harmless

47:05.603 --> 47:07.139
about the feminine
which I aspire to.

47:07.272 --> 47:08.273
I aspire to be harmless.

47:08.773 --> 47:10.708
Oh, you think I'm harmless?

47:13.078 --> 47:15.646
Yeah...
That's not what I meant to say.

47:16.048 --> 47:20.718
What, I'm biol... like, upper body
strength-wise, you know what I mean?

47:22.620 --> 47:24.522
Okay, but I'm th... I'm thinking

47:24.956 --> 47:26.591
three pieces of bread stacked

47:26.724 --> 47:28.392
is not a bread sandwich

47:28.526 --> 47:31.596
because it's all made out of
the same fundamental ingredient.

47:31.729 --> 47:33.031
That's just, it's just bread.

47:33.165 --> 47:35.366
What about, like, three stacks
of lettuce?

47:35.533 --> 47:36.573
Well, that's just lettuce.

47:36.701 --> 47:38.237
That's not a lettuce sandwich.

47:39.271 --> 47:42.151
Just think about it. There's a world
where you see three pieces of bread,

47:42.207 --> 47:43.941
and you say,
that's three pieces of bread,

47:44.076 --> 47:46.236
and there's a world where
you see three pieces of bread

47:46.311 --> 47:47.591
and say,
that's a bread sandwich,

47:47.645 --> 47:48.913
and to me...

47:49.047 --> 47:50.748
the latter
is a more beautiful world.

47:51.682 --> 47:55.720
- You've written other books?
- Uh-huh. Just one.

47:55.853 --> 47:58.756
- What was it called?
- <i>Italian Studies.</i>

47:59.157 --> 48:00.225
Wh... What is it about?

48:00.791 --> 48:02.660
It's like a,
a short story collection.

48:03.095 --> 48:04.795
Which one's your favorite?

48:06.530 --> 48:08.166
I didn't get
to the last one, but,

48:08.532 --> 48:11.802
so it could've been that one.
I didn't, I didn't get to finish it today,

48:11.936 --> 48:12.936
but, um...

48:13.272 --> 48:14.805
the "Midland Marines," I think.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.276
Do you forget all your
works after you write them?

48:17.441 --> 48:19.244
Yeah. Isn't that part of it?

48:19.877 --> 48:22.914
Like, does, does memory
even matter,

48:23.282 --> 48:25.317
- given that we're...
- When I was a kid, um...

48:25.449 --> 48:28.853
- It's like a goldfish...
- Yeah, I used to pretend, um...

48:29.187 --> 48:33.691
I would drink, like, Gatorade or
drink some, like, fancy-colored soda,

48:33.824 --> 48:36.128
and I'd pretend it wipes
my whole memory,

48:36.361 --> 48:39.031
and then I'd close my eyes,
and I'd wake up and pretend

48:39.164 --> 48:42.833
to look at my house
as if I'd never seen it before,

48:42.967 --> 48:44.735
and see how long I could go on,

48:44.869 --> 48:46.437
like, pretending
I didn't know anything

48:46.570 --> 48:48.273
about my house or,
like, my family

48:48.439 --> 48:51.642
throughout all my conversations,
and I thought it was fun.

48:51.776 --> 48:53.178
How long did it last?

48:53.345 --> 48:55.913
I would go
for a long time. The whole day.

48:56.048 --> 48:57.515
But usually when I got hungry,

48:57.648 --> 48:59.550
I would ask my mom
to make me a snack.

49:01.919 --> 49:04.588
I'd get so into it, like,
it felt like I actually forgot.

49:06.258 --> 49:07.625
A new perspective.

49:08.693 --> 49:11.163
It's been an anxious life,
if I'm honest.

49:11.296 --> 49:14.966
- Yeah.
- Um, an anxious kid.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.302
Do you think it's just,
like, brain chemistry?

49:17.436 --> 49:18.903
Yeah, I really do,

49:19.104 --> 49:21.306
and I think that's honestly
really important to realize,

49:21.440 --> 49:22.773
'cause I think that, like,

49:22.974 --> 49:25.344
you've gotta not think
that you're a terrible person

49:25.476 --> 49:28.713
'cause you can't control
yourself as much as you want to,

49:28.980 --> 49:30.349
and you just have to realize

49:30.881 --> 49:33.321
there's a lot in you that's
controlling you through different,

49:33.352 --> 49:38.256
like, ways that you can't necessarily,
like, take over all the time.

53:16.508 --> 53:18.343
- Well, I'm working on a novel.
- Hmm.

53:18.909 --> 53:20.744
But I, I started short stories.

53:20.878 --> 53:22.447
- Hmm.
- It's like a collection.

53:23.013 --> 53:26.685
And this one guy who just smokes lots of
weed and is, you know, confused about...

53:26.817 --> 53:28.752
- That.
- Why the pot-smoking kid?

53:28.886 --> 53:30.121
Yeah.

53:30.322 --> 53:31.922
I don't know,
I'm just genuinely curious,

53:32.022 --> 53:33.867
'cause I feel like it's a
stereotype, and I don't,

53:33.891 --> 53:34.892
I don't know why people...

53:35.025 --> 53:36.328
That feels judgmental.

53:36.461 --> 53:39.364
No, it's, like, why,
why that perspective?

53:41.032 --> 53:42.967
I don't see
why that's a problem.

53:43.201 --> 53:44.902
No,
I don't think it's a problem.

53:45.036 --> 53:46.737
I just feel like it's not...

53:51.376 --> 53:52.876
original, I guess.

53:53.877 --> 53:55.746
No, I, I mean,
I don't, I don't know.

53:55.879 --> 53:58.882
I'm sorry. Like, I don't, I don't
know what you write normally. Um...

54:00.385 --> 54:02.354
Why don't you just go fuck
yourself?

54:03.521 --> 54:06.124
- Um...
- Okay.

54:07.392 --> 54:08.859
All right.

54:10.428 --> 54:12.664
She doesn't need to say why.

54:12.863 --> 54:14.699
I think she was just asking.

54:14.832 --> 54:16.767
- Hmm?
- I think she was just asking.

54:16.900 --> 54:19.337
- I don't think...
- But why does she have to be like...

54:30.148 --> 54:31.416
Uh, I'm Alina.

54:33.251 --> 54:35.019
And I'm from here. I'm a writer.

54:35.853 --> 54:36.893
Wh... What are your names?

54:37.322 --> 54:40.125
- Taylor.
- I'm Sasha.

54:40.625 --> 54:41.825
Lucinda.

54:44.629 --> 54:48.066
- No, you're not Lucinda.
- Yes, I am.

54:48.199 --> 54:50.135
And that's Taylor and Sasha.

54:51.069 --> 54:53.338
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

54:53.471 --> 54:55.407
- Lucinda.
- But you're not.

54:58.942 --> 55:01.446
- I think we should call somebody. Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:02.113 --> 55:03.348
Are... Are you okay?

55:04.582 --> 55:06.551
They bought us
Philly cheesesteaks.

55:07.985 --> 55:09.287
And it's, it's cool,

55:09.421 --> 55:11.165
'cause it's not really
a Philly cheesesteak...

55:11.189 --> 55:13.269
'cause you in Philly,
it's really just a cheesesteak.

55:15.160 --> 55:17.395
So, it's just for the hype?

55:17.629 --> 55:20.998
A New York burger, I guess.
It's like, it's like Chinese food.

55:21.166 --> 55:24.302
- It's a real thing? It could be a thing.
- I don't know.

55:24.436 --> 55:25.903
I just made that up just now.

55:26.037 --> 55:27.415
I mean, there's chopped cheese,
that's all.

55:27.439 --> 55:29.907
That's the New,
that's the New York burger.

55:30.041 --> 55:33.712
That was funny.
That was funny. That was funny.

55:33.844 --> 55:35.580
You hear chopped cheese,
and you were like,

55:35.714 --> 55:37.682
"Oh, yeah. That's New York."

55:37.915 --> 55:39.484
I just want
to be a person like you.

55:40.618 --> 55:43.521
Okay, but y...
you don't know me.

56:24.496 --> 56:26.097
<i>I'm kind of numb to it.</i>

56:30.000 --> 56:31.403
<i>Oh, that makes me sad.</i>

56:36.040 --> 56:38.042
Well, I'm sorry
that it makes you sad.

56:38.276 --> 56:40.879
See, I think you're strong,

56:41.146 --> 56:44.182
and I think you seem broken
at the same time,

56:44.315 --> 56:47.452
and I think that I'm that, too.

56:50.688 --> 56:51.688
Are you?

56:56.261 --> 56:57.395
<i>Yeah.</i>

57:01.533 --> 57:03.334
<i>Yeah. I mean,
I think everybody is...</i>

57:05.437 --> 57:07.117
<i>or at least everyone's broken
in some ways,</i>

57:07.172 --> 57:09.674
<i>and only,
only a few of us are strong.</i>

57:13.745 --> 57:15.647
Well, you're stronger than me.

57:16.080 --> 57:18.917
Why do you say that?
I thought you said I was a harmless woman.

57:19.584 --> 57:23.154
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

57:25.356 --> 57:30.328
I d... I say that because you were,
you were, you were strong enough

57:31.463 --> 57:34.866
to make me see,
or at least engage with me.

57:35.066 --> 57:37.666
I'm not saying that you're, like,
the fuckin' prophet or whatever,

57:37.735 --> 57:40.939
but it's like you were,
you were strong enough to

57:41.072 --> 57:45.343
take my force of whatever it was
and give me sight.

57:45.710 --> 57:48.313
Yeah, but you're doing
that for me too.

57:48.513 --> 57:50.415
You're strong enough
to do that for me.

57:50.915 --> 57:54.619
You're strong enough to do that just
with, just with love,

57:54.752 --> 57:59.557
or just by looking at me,
just by being you.

58:02.025 --> 58:05.330
But, like, ev... everything I do
is, is driven by some sort of desperation.

58:05.497 --> 58:08.566
I've got the problem of seeing
everything I've, I've ever did,

58:08.700 --> 58:11.803
all the bad things I've done to
people and all the ways I'm insecure.

58:11.970 --> 58:17.075
Like, I've gotten into so many
fights when I was...

58:17.208 --> 58:18.877
posturing so much,

58:19.310 --> 58:24.014
I end up getting my ass kicked,
and it's like I just want...

01:01:14.318 --> 01:01:15.553
Hey. Uh...

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.588
They went back to the house,
but we can walk.

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:20.491
Cool. Yeah.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.828
My friends
are probably sleeping.

01:01:24.228 --> 01:01:26.031
Yeah, thanks
for letting me stay with you.

01:01:26.165 --> 01:01:28.332
Of course.

01:01:34.872 --> 01:01:38.743
It's
"Gowanus Canal." Like, that's...

01:01:38.876 --> 01:01:40.411
Oh, it's the name.

01:01:40.545 --> 01:01:41.813
Yeah. "Gowanus Canal."

01:01:43.481 --> 01:01:47.152
But in the song, I sing,
"Gowanus River,"

01:01:47.418 --> 01:01:54.759
which is so fucking dumb...
Because I need it to rhyme trigger...

01:02:07.672 --> 01:02:09.208
It was a trigger.

01:02:10.742 --> 01:02:12.920
Everyone knows it's... I mean,
it's sort of the same thing, isn't it?

01:02:12.944 --> 01:02:14.504
- Yeah, I g...
- It's effectively water.

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:16.447
Yeah, but it's, like,
people know.

01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:18.421
I really don't think
you should worry about it.

01:02:19.016 --> 01:02:20.752
I'll take it.
My dog is going to ruin it.

01:02:20.885 --> 01:02:22.687
- Okay.
- I'll put it in the closet.

01:02:40.738 --> 01:02:42.740
His name's Ollie.
He's really cute.

01:02:42.874 --> 01:02:44.109
I think you'd like him a lot.

01:02:44.243 --> 01:02:45.610
- I have a dog.
- What?

01:02:46.544 --> 01:02:49.047
- I have a dog.
- You do? Cool.

01:02:49.181 --> 01:02:51.482
- Yes.
- What kind of dog is it?

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.619
- I lost him.
- You did?

01:02:54.786 --> 01:02:57.288
- Yeah, I have a dog.
- When'd you lose it?

01:02:57.421 --> 01:02:59.624
- I have a dog.
- Are you okay?

01:02:59.991 --> 01:03:00.991
Yeah.

01:03:02.127 --> 01:03:03.761
Yeah, I just am, uh...

01:04:06.591 --> 01:04:08.426
There she is.

01:04:13.764 --> 01:04:16.868
- Hey. Hey. Hi. Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Not a problem.

01:04:17.102 --> 01:04:18.103
Thank you.

01:05:36.547 --> 01:05:38.083
Yeah. It's freezing.

01:05:40.851 --> 01:05:44.555
Oh, and there was this girl.
She has, like, um, short, dark hair

01:05:44.922 --> 01:05:46.958
and we went in this
beach house by the woods,

01:05:47.092 --> 01:05:49.492
and she helped me to get home.
Do you know who that might be?

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.163
- No.
- Like black hair.

01:05:51.662 --> 01:05:52.964
I don't think so.

01:05:53.365 --> 01:05:55.666
I was trying to find
her for so long afterwards.

01:05:57.202 --> 01:06:01.073
Yeah. All I know is
you showed up with Simon.

01:06:01.739 --> 01:06:03.259
Um, he said
that you guys were friends,

01:06:03.507 --> 01:06:05.977
and you were an author writing
a book about teenagers, so...

01:06:06.111 --> 01:06:07.912
- Really?
- So you were going to research us

01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:09.580
- and have dinner with us.
- Did I?

01:06:09.714 --> 01:06:11.849
Yeah. Um...

01:06:12.717 --> 01:06:15.653
And then I read
your short stories as well.

01:06:15.786 --> 01:06:17.655
- You did?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:18.256 --> 01:06:21.993
- Uh, <i>Italian Studies</i> and <i>The Veil of Cashmere...</i>
- That's really sweet.

01:06:23.261 --> 01:06:25.197
<i>I think
maybe you should talk to Simon.</i>

01:06:25.496 --> 01:06:28.066
<i>Yeah? I don't know.</i>

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:32.636
<i>I just, wanted to thank the girl that
helped me, and then move on, really.</i>

01:06:33.205 --> 01:06:35.740
<i>It just seemed like
you two were really close.</i>

01:06:36.274 --> 01:06:37.409
<i>What's he like?</i>

01:06:38.176 --> 01:06:40.745
<i>I don't actually
know him that well. Um...</i>

01:06:42.013 --> 01:06:45.083
<i>- Is he okay?
- No, he's fine.</i>

01:06:45.217 --> 01:06:47.918
<i>I mean, he's in college
doing his thing now.</i>

01:06:50.122 --> 01:06:51.965
<i>Um, I don't know. I still think
he'd want to meet you.</i>

01:06:51.989 --> 01:06:53.125
<i>Yeah, I just...</i>

01:06:53.557 --> 01:06:55.826
<i>Yeah, I just don't think
I should meet him.</i>

01:06:56.495 --> 01:06:59.107
<i>I mean, I know... I think you can
have, like, something special and brief</i>

01:06:59.131 --> 01:07:02.167
<i>and you don't have to chase it,
and it remains what it was,</i>

01:07:02.666 --> 01:07:06.804
<i>and it'll always be there,
the effect of it, in some way.</i>

01:07:07.439 --> 01:07:10.409
<i>I need to protect them,
the people I love,</i>

01:07:10.741 --> 01:07:12.144
<i>if that makes sense.</i>

01:07:15.247 --> 01:07:17.681
<i>Um, okay. I mean,
not really, honestly, but...</i>

01:07:18.749 --> 01:07:20.152
<i>Okay, look, for example,</i>

01:07:20.519 --> 01:07:22.263
<i>earlier I was with my husband.
I was late for my husband,</i>

01:07:22.287 --> 01:07:24.655
<i>and I know that in the,</i>

01:07:25.424 --> 01:07:27.292
<i>in him waiting for me,</i>

01:07:27.758 --> 01:07:29.428
<i>the thought would've
crossed his mind</i>

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.996
<i>that maybe it's happened again,
or it's happening,</i>

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:36.435
<i>and I hate that.
I hate to be a burden like that,</i>

01:07:37.001 --> 01:07:38.836
<i>and, and we've come
so far through it,</i>

01:07:39.438 --> 01:07:42.307
<i>and I just don't want
to reopen it, you know?</i>

01:07:42.573 --> 01:07:46.211
<i>It's good now, and I just,
I kind of want to keep it that way.</i>
