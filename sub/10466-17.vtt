00:18.670 --> 00:20.846
WHY DIDN'T YOU FINISH THAT?

00:20.846 --> 00:22.283

00:22.283 --> 00:23.501
OH, SHUT UP.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.286

00:25.286 --> 00:26.852
ACTUALLY--

00:28.811 --> 00:30.508
I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

00:37.689 --> 00:43.086
AHEM, 'CAUSE, UM,
I'VE BEEN TALKING

00:43.086 --> 00:44.653
CHARLIE, WHY WOULD YOU--

00:44.653 --> 00:47.438
I MEAN, I'VE--I'VE GOT

ABOUT THIS.

I'VE GOT
TO MAKE SOME PLANS.

00:51.051 --> 00:55.881
I MEAN, BAILEY AND
JULIA, THEY'LL BE--

01:03.846 --> 01:05.630
I MEAN, GOD,
FOR ME TO JUST--

01:08.546 --> 01:11.201
I KNOW THIS IS HUGE.

01:11.201 --> 01:15.901
AND PAUL, MAN, I KNOW
THIS IS A LOT TO ASK OF
HIM AND YOU, TOO, BUT--

01:41.797 --> 01:44.713
I KNOW.
I KNOW THEY WOULD,

01:44.713 --> 01:48.673
BUT THEY'RE--
THEY'RE TOO YOUNG.

01:48.673 --> 01:51.023
IT'S TOO MUCH.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.721

LIKE I'M SAYING
TO BAY AND JULIA,

01:52.721 --> 01:56.333
GO AWAY OR ANYTHING.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'D
SAY THAT TO THEM.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.728

01:59.728 --> 02:01.904

AND STAND GUARD FOR ME.
IS THAT COOL?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.664
ARE YOU SURE?

10:23.274 --> 10:24.711
YEAH, YOU CAN JUST,
UH, YOU KNOW,

10:24.711 --> 10:27.975
TELL ME ALL ABOUT WHO'S
SLEEPING WITH WHO
ON YOUR SOAP.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.458
BAILEY, NOW, WE HAVE
TO GO HOME THIS MINUTE.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.679
NO, I CAN'T.
I GOTTA STAY HERE
AND SET UP EVERYTHING.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.463
AND THEN I--
JEFF, COULD YOU GET

10:38.463 --> 10:39.987
THE SPECIALS BOARD
FOR ME, PLEASE?

10:39.987 --> 10:43.120
LISTEN TO ME. THERE IS
6 INCHES OF WATER
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM

10:43.120 --> 10:45.035
AND WHATEVER WAS IN
THE BASEMENT IS RUINED.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.515
CAN'T YOU--
NO, I CAN'T.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.995
BAILEY, BECAUSE IT'S
WET AND IT'S HEAVY

10:47.995 --> 10:49.213
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE LONGER WE WAIT--

10:49.213 --> 10:52.652
OK. OK.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.959
YOU KNOW WHAT? IF WE MOTOR
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW,
THEN I COULD--

10:55.959 --> 10:56.960
DAMN IT!

10:56.960 --> 10:58.788
WHAT?

10:58.788 --> 11:02.487
THERE'S THIS THING
AT CLAUD'S SCHOOL
THAT I HAVE TO--

11:02.487 --> 11:05.839
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JULE CAN COVER. COME ON.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.058
USE A HANGER.
A WIRE COAT HANGER.

11:08.058 --> 11:10.278
I DON'T KNOW.
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
SEEN A MOVIE?

11:10.278 --> 11:11.845
THEN BREAK THE WINDOW.
JUST GET HERE, DONNA.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.716
I NEED YOU TO SIT WITH HIM.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.545
OK, AS SOON AS YOU CAN,
BUT COME ON, I'M ALREADY LATE.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.590
OWEN, GIVE IT A REST.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.679
HE'S GOING TO BE
TOO BUSY TEACHING ME

11:19.679 --> 11:20.636
HOW TO PLAY CHESS,
AREN'T YOU, DAD?

11:20.636 --> 11:21.637
WELL, JEFF, I...

11:21.637 --> 11:24.379
HI, ZOE,
IS BAILEY THERE?

11:24.379 --> 11:27.034
OH. I WANTED
TO CATCH HIM BEFORE HE--

11:27.034 --> 11:29.645
NO, NO MESSAGE.
THANKS. BYE.

11:29.645 --> 11:32.430
TV: ME, TOO, SO YOU'D
BETTER PRACTICE UP
ON YOUR CHESS.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.041
BYE, MOM.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.748
NOT YET?

11:45.748 --> 11:47.271
NO.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.709
ARE YOU SURE THEY
HAD THE RIGHT TIME?

11:52.189 --> 11:56.585
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
LET ME KNOW WHEN
SOMEBODY GETS HERE.

12:12.470 --> 12:13.471
[FOOTSTEPS]

12:13.471 --> 12:14.603
CLAUDIA?

12:14.603 --> 12:15.691
NO, IT'S ME.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.562
DO WE STILL HAVE THAT
WET-VAC THING HERE?

12:17.562 --> 12:18.999
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.349
HEY, LISTEN, I'M SORRY
I FLAKED. HOW'D IT GO?

12:21.349 --> 12:22.567
HOW DID WHAT GO?

12:22.567 --> 12:23.873
CLAUD'S MEETING.

12:23.873 --> 12:27.268
I TRIED, BUT PHI BETA DONNA
LOCKED HER KEYS IN THE CAR.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.660
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT
WAIT, WAIT.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.706
YOU DIDN'T GO
TO THE MEETING?

12:30.706 --> 12:33.709
NO. I WAS STUCK HERE.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.232
YOU WEREN'T--
NO, I WASN'T.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.017
THERE WAS A FLOOD
AT THE APARTMENT BUILDING

12:37.017 --> 12:38.235
AND I HAD TO CLEAN UP
A HUGE MESS.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.889
I FIGURED YOU WOULD COVER.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.848
I FIGURED YOU WOULD
COVER. WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL ME?

12:41.848 --> 12:43.545
WHY WOULD I CALL YOU?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THERE.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.460
GOD, WHAT DID WE DO?

12:45.460 --> 12:46.548
WE SCREWED UP.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.767
DAMN IT, HOW DID THIS--

12:47.767 --> 12:49.159
OK, OK, WAIT A SECOND.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.727
DO YOU THINK ANYBODY'S
THERE NOW AT THE SCHOOL?

12:51.727 --> 12:53.860
WE CAN CALL SOMEONE.
WHAT'S HER FACE,
THE COUNSELOR LADY,?

12:53.860 --> 12:56.558
NO, IT'S TOO LATE.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN
DO UNTIL TOMORROW.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.130
DO YOU THINK CLAUDIA WENT?

13:03.130 --> 13:06.002
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
IF SHE DID? WE DIDN'T.

13:06.002 --> 13:09.527
YOU KNOW, I CAN JUST
HEAR IT AT THE SCHOOL.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.486
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED
TO GET THIS KID
TO GO TO CLASS

13:11.486 --> 13:12.922
IF THEY CAN'T EVEN
COME TO A MEETING?

13:12.922 --> 13:16.186
AND GOD, CHARLIE,
3 HOURS AGO,
WE WERE TELLING HIM

13:16.186 --> 13:19.668
HOW--HOW TRUSTWORTHY
AND RESPONSIBLE WE ARE.

13:19.668 --> 13:23.280
JULE, ENOUGH.
WE MADE ONE MISTAKE, OK?

13:23.280 --> 13:25.065
IT DOESN'T MAKE US
INCOMPETENT,

13:25.065 --> 13:27.023
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT CHARLIE'S RIGHT,
BECAUSE HE ISN'T.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.857
CLAUDIA, IS THAT YOU?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.641
NO, IT'S ME.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.948
OH. YOU'RE JUST
GETTING HOME?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.515
WHERE'D YOU GO
AFTER WORK?

13:40.515 --> 13:43.561
UH, NO, I DIDN'T.
I, UH,

13:43.561 --> 13:45.912
I KINDA GOT STUCK
ON THIS TUNE-UP.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.783
SORT OF TRICKIER
THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.785
WHAT DO YOU GET
FOR OVERTIME THERE?
IS IT TIME AND A HALF?

13:51.091 --> 13:52.440
UH, I GUESS.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.571
WELL, GOOD THEN.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.617
SEE, AT LEAST
THERE'S ONE ADVANTAGE

13:55.617 --> 13:57.010
TO WORKING FOR
SOMEONE ELSE.

13:57.010 --> 14:00.622
UH, WELL, YEAH,
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT THAT WAY.

14:01.971 --> 14:02.972
HOW'S IT GOING?

14:02.972 --> 14:04.278
IT'S GOING.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.409
CLAUDIA.

14:07.281 --> 14:08.717
MAN, THERE'S, LIKE,
NOTHING IN HERE.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.546
WHERE WERE YOU, IT'S--

14:11.546 --> 14:12.939
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S PRETTY IRONIC.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.463
WHERE WAS I?
WHERE WERE YOU?

14:15.463 --> 14:18.553
I SAT THERE LIKE SOME LOSER.

14:18.553 --> 14:22.687
OK, LOOK,
I'M SORRY. REALLY.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.125
WE BOTH GOT HUNG UP.
BAILEY THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO GO

14:25.125 --> 14:26.822
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS.
IT WAS DUMB.

14:26.822 --> 14:29.520
YEAH, WELL, EVERYBODY
HAS PRIORITIES.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.653
NO, NO,
THAT IS NOT--

14:31.653 --> 14:33.220
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE BLEW IT OFF.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.657
IT WAS A MIX-UP.

14:35.657 --> 14:36.832
AND I'M GOING
RESCHEDULE.

14:36.832 --> 14:37.877
FIRST THING
TOMORROW MORNING,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.574
I'M CALLING
MS. HOFFMAN.

14:39.574 --> 14:42.359
IT'S HUFFMAN.

14:46.755 --> 14:47.669
HI.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.629
OH.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.679
I HAVE 2 WORDS
FOR EVERY PERSON
WITH A CHILD--

14:57.679 --> 14:59.942
BICYCLE HELMET.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.422
OH, NO.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.945
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:02.945 --> 15:08.429
YOU GO OUT THERE AND
THERE ARE THESE PARENTS
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

15:08.429 --> 15:11.040
AND I HAVE TO TELL THEM.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.434
THE FATHER, HE BOUGHT HER
THE BIKE FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.349
HE'S JUST--

15:15.349 --> 15:17.655
AND I KEPT TRYING TO
COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

15:17.655 --> 15:21.268
I KEPT THINKING
IS THERE ANYTHING--

15:21.268 --> 15:25.663
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO MAKE IT
EVEN A LITTLE BETTER.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.538
I LOVE YOU.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.716
I LOVE YOU FOR
THINKING LIKE THAT.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.721
AND I KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL...

15:39.721 --> 15:41.897
SORT OF.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.379
I SAW CHARLIE TODAY.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.946
OH.

15:46.946 --> 15:52.081
AND I THINK MAYBE
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU AND I CAN DO

15:52.081 --> 15:58.827
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE
LESS HORRIBLE FOR HIM.

15:58.827 --> 16:03.745
LISTEN, I HAVE TO TELL
YOU WE FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.877
THAT WAS--IT WAS
TOTALLY OUR FAULT.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.705
WE KNOW THIS IS A BIG DEAL,
IT'S JUST THAT THINGS--

16:07.705 --> 16:09.794
WHERE IS CHARLIE?

16:09.794 --> 16:11.622
HE'S THE ONE I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO CALL.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.668
I KNOW AND HE CARES
ABOUT THIS, TOO, A LOT.

16:13.668 --> 16:16.845
IT'S JUST THAT
HE'S REALLY SWAMPED,
SO HE KIND OF--

16:16.845 --> 16:19.021
HE'S HER GUARDIAN.
HE SHOULD BE HERE.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.805
WE KNOW, BUT--

16:20.805 --> 16:23.765
I'VE GOT TO TELL
YOU GUYS, I AM REALLY
STARTING TO WONDER

16:23.765 --> 16:25.419
WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND HERE.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.161
YOUR SISTER IS
AN EXCELLENT STUDENT.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.380
HONOR ROLL
HER FIRST SEMESTER.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.426
AND NOW, SHE'S CUTTING
CLASSES LEFT AND RIGHT.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.384
SHE'S DROPPED OUT
OF ORCHESTRA.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.647
WE SEND LETTERS HOME
AND GET NO ANSWERS.

16:36.647 --> 16:37.648
WHAT LETTERS?

16:37.648 --> 16:39.824
YOU DIDN'T GET THEM?

16:39.824 --> 16:42.653
WELL, MAYBE--MAYBE
CHARLIE GOT THEM.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.568
PROBABLY CHARLIE
GOT THEM. I'M SURE
CHARLIE GOT THEM.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.483
AND NOW CLAUDIA'S
NOT HERE.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.920
OH, WELL,
DIDN'T SOMEONE
FROM THE OFFICE

16:48.920 --> 16:50.009
CALL HER
OUT OF CLASS?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.272
SHE ISN'T
IN CLASS TODAY.

16:53.795 --> 16:58.321
RIGHT. RIGHT,
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.236
SHE HAS A SORE THROAT,
SO I TOLD HER SHE COULD, UH--

17:00.236 --> 17:01.759
OK, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.718
THIS IS JUST
GETTING RIDICULOUS.

17:03.718 --> 17:07.113
YOU'RE SAYING SHE'S
IN CLASS. YOU'RE
SAYING SHE'S SICK.

17:08.505 --> 17:13.075
OK, OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,
MS. HUFFMAN?

17:13.075 --> 17:16.818
THE TRUTH IS IS THAT
THERE'S SOME STUFF

17:16.818 --> 17:18.254
GOING ON IN OUR FAMILY
RIGHT NOW

17:18.254 --> 17:21.040
THAT'S--THAT'S BEEN VERY
DIFFICULT FOR CLAUDIA.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.999
CHARLIE HAS PNEUMONIA.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.784
AND THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT
HERE AT THIS MEETING,

17:26.784 --> 17:28.003
BUT HE'S GOING TO BE OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL SOON

17:28.003 --> 17:29.265
AND THEN HE
CAN GET BACK--

17:29.265 --> 17:30.962
HE'S IN
THE HOSPITAL?

17:30.962 --> 17:34.923
WELL, HE'S BEEN
KIND OF RUN DOWN
FROM THE RADIATION.

17:34.923 --> 17:38.013
WAIT, WHY RADIATION?

17:38.013 --> 17:40.624
YOU SAID HE
HAS PNEUMONIA.
WHY IS HE--

17:40.624 --> 17:44.889
THAT, BUT ALSO,
THE BIG THING--

17:44.889 --> 17:46.108
HE HAS
HODGKIN'S DISEASE.

17:47.805 --> 17:48.850
MY GOD.

17:48.850 --> 17:49.851
BUT--BUT THEY'RE
TREATING IT

17:49.851 --> 17:51.200
AND HE'S GETTING BETTER.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.160
AND HE'LL BE OUT OF THE
HOSPITAL IN, LIKE, DAYS.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.122
ALL RIGHT, BUT
IN THE MEANTIME,

18:00.122 --> 18:02.820
WE STILL NEED TO DEAL
WITH YOUR SISTER.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.910
I KNOW.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.869
I KNOW. WE GET IT.
WE GET IT,

18:07.869 --> 18:09.740
AND WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.917
I'LL TALK TO CLAUDIA, OK?
AND, UH--

18:12.917 --> 18:14.005
WE'LL GET IT
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.399
THANK YOU. THIS WAS--
THIS WAS GOOD.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.318
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WORKED FOR THESE PEOPLE?

18:22.318 --> 18:25.626
MMM, A YEAR.
YEAR-AND-A-HALF.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.976
SAW THE SIGN OVER THERE
FOR THE MANAGEMENT TRAINEE
THING THEY HAVE.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.109
YOU GONNA DO THAT?
IS THAT THE BIG PLAN?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.762
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

18:31.762 --> 18:35.331
THIS WHOLE LONG-TERM
PLANNING LIFE-DREAM
KIND OF THING--

18:35.331 --> 18:37.028
WAY OVERRATED.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.204
YEAH?
YEAH, I MEAN,
IT'S, LIKE,

18:38.204 --> 18:40.031
WHY GIVE YOURSELF
AN ULCER, RIGHT?

18:40.031 --> 18:41.337
BECAUSE THEN
IF THINGS
DON'T WORK OUT,

18:41.337 --> 18:44.993
YOU WALK AROUND,
LIKE, "OH, BOOHOO,
MY LIFE IS RUINED."

18:44.993 --> 18:47.952
I SAY JUST LIVE.
SEE WHAT COMES UP.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.867
OH, A BIG PHILOSOPHER.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.173
DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.522
I'M NOT.

18:52.522 --> 18:56.265
AND ALSO, UH, YOU KNOW,
I KIND OF LIKE THIS.

18:56.265 --> 18:59.964
I MEAN, I'M NO HELL'S
ANGEL OR ANYTHING,
BUT BIKES?

18:59.964 --> 19:02.793
GUYS WITH BIKES?
OOH, BABY.

19:04.273 --> 19:08.234
THIS WHOLE THING,
IT'S SO--FREE.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.932
YOU KNOW, AND SEXY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

19:10.932 --> 19:12.716
YOU THINK THAT?

19:12.716 --> 19:14.370
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:14.370 --> 19:17.199
RIDING ON THE BACK
OF SOME BEAT UP OLD HOG,

19:17.199 --> 19:18.940
WITH THAT DEATH-GRIP
THING GIRLS DO

19:18.940 --> 19:20.420
TO HOLD ON AROUND
THE GUY'S WAIST.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.422
YOU'RE SO CLOSE,
YOU KNOW?

19:22.422 --> 19:24.815
YOU'RE SQUASHED
TOGETHER, LIKE SPOONS.

19:24.815 --> 19:28.036
YOU'RE MOVING FAST
AND YOU CAN'T TALK.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.604
ALL YOU CAN DO
IS FEEL EACH OTHER.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.783
MAYBE YOU'LL GIVE ME
A RIDE SOMETIME?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.790
MMM.

19:47.055 --> 19:50.450
[SIGHS]

19:53.670 --> 19:55.890
HEY.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.805
HOW YOU DOING?

19:59.720 --> 20:04.028
MMM, MAN, I WAS HAVING
A WEIRD DREAM.

20:04.028 --> 20:08.207
I WAS SKIING,
BUT IN MY BARE FEET.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.867
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
I DREAMT LAST NIGHT?

20:19.087 --> 20:20.871
WHAT'S THAT?

20:22.786 --> 20:27.356
WE WERE ON A LAKE.
YOU AND ME.

20:27.356 --> 20:31.012
I WAS IN A BOAT.
THIS LITTLE
RICKETY THING,

20:31.012 --> 20:33.884
AND YOU WERE SWIMMING
CIRCLES AROUND IT.

20:36.147 --> 20:40.108
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU--YOU STARTED
TO GO UNDER

20:40.108 --> 20:45.113
AND, UM, AND YOU WERE
YELLING TO ME.

20:45.113 --> 20:49.857
AND I--I THREW OUT
THIS--INNER TUBE,
AND YOU GRABBED IT.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.471
AND I SAVED YOU.

20:55.471 --> 20:59.040
WHAT'S--KIRSTEN?
WHAT'S--

21:03.174 --> 21:05.873
YOU KNOW PAUL'S
A GOOD MAN, RIGHT?

21:08.136 --> 21:12.314
I MEAN, ALL--
ALL HE DOES IS
TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.577
ALL DAY LONG,
HE TAKES CARE
OF THESE KIDS,

21:14.577 --> 21:18.189
AND HE CARES
ABOUT THEM.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.235
IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S SELFISH.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.673
BUT HE JUST--

21:28.504 --> 21:30.941
HE JUST NEVER WANTED
ANY OF HIS OWN.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.990
HE NEVER DID.

21:35.990 --> 21:40.342
I MEAN,
I GUESS THAT'S--

21:40.342 --> 21:42.779
THAT'S PART OF
THE REASON WHY WE
ENDED UP TOGETHER.

21:42.779 --> 21:43.954
I KNOW IT IS.

21:46.261 --> 21:51.005
THEN, OK.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.618
WE CAN'T TAKE THEM,
CHARLIE.

21:55.618 --> 21:56.793
OK.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.974
I WANTED TO BE ABLE
TO DO THIS FOR YOU.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.978
I KNOW YOU DID.

22:13.244 --> 22:16.683
JAMES DAY, CHILD
PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.685
CAN I COME IN
FOR A MINUTE?

22:20.295 --> 22:21.427
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:21.427 --> 22:23.516
ARE YOU CLAUDIA SALINGER?

22:25.126 --> 22:26.780
YEAH. SO?

22:26.780 --> 22:29.348
I NEED TO TALK TO WHOEVER'S
IN CHARGE OF THIS HOUSEHOLD.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.915
COULD YOU PLEASE
LET ME IN?

22:37.878 --> 22:41.142
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
FOR YOU TO WORRY
ABOUT HERE, SO--

22:43.187 --> 22:46.321
THAT'S...OWEN?

22:46.321 --> 22:48.845
UH-HUH. YEAH,
THAT'S OWEN
AND I'M CLAUDIA.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.673
AND EVERYONE'S
FINE HERE, SO--

22:50.673 --> 22:53.415
UH, WHERE'S JULIA?

22:53.415 --> 22:54.590
SHE'S THE ONE WHO
LIVES HERE, RIGHT?

22:55.809 --> 22:58.202
RIGHT. UH, SHE'S AT WORK.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.553
WHERE?

23:00.553 --> 23:03.294
I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S--
WELL, SHE'S TEMPING.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.774
SO, IF THERE WAS
AN EMERGENCY

23:04.774 --> 23:06.167
AND YOU NEEDED
TO REACH HER,
YOU COULDN'T?

23:06.167 --> 23:09.039
I GUESS, BUT SHE'LL
BE HOME SOON.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.084
WHEN?

23:10.084 --> 23:12.434
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T EXACTLY

23:12.434 --> 23:14.218
KNOW WHEN,
BUT, UM, SOON.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.264
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BAILEY'S PROBABLY
AT THE RESTAURANT,

23:16.264 --> 23:18.571
SO I'LL JUST GO
GIVE HIM A CALL.

23:18.571 --> 23:19.528
DOES HE LIVE HERE?

23:23.880 --> 23:25.969
NO.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.109
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN CALL HIM
FROM MY OFFICE.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.852
I NEED YOU
AND YOUR BROTHER
TO COME WITH ME.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.157
WHAT?

23:40.157 --> 23:42.203
WE NEED TO GO DOWN
THERE AND I NEED
TO MAKE SOME CALLS

23:42.203 --> 23:44.597
AND FIND OUT EXACTLY
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THIS FAMILY.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.685
WHAT?

23:45.685 --> 23:47.077
HEY, OWEN.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.166
I'M JIMMY. WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE A RIDE, OK?

23:49.166 --> 23:51.125
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING? STOP THAT!

23:51.125 --> 23:52.213
YOU LIKE
MY NEW TRUCK?

23:52.213 --> 23:54.128
OH, THAT IS ONE--
STOP THAT!

23:54.128 --> 23:55.216
LEAVE HIM ALONE!
PUT HIM DOWN!

23:55.216 --> 23:56.478
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF HIM!

23:56.478 --> 23:58.132
GET WHATEVER YOU NEED.
YOUR KEYS, WHATEVER.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.438
PLEASE?
SET HIM DOWN!

23:59.438 --> 24:01.701
LET'S JUST
TAKE IT EASY, OK?

24:01.701 --> 24:02.832
LET'S MAKE THIS EASIER
FOR EVERYBODY.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.051
WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

24:04.051 --> 24:07.402
LEAVE HIM ALONE!
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE!

24:11.928 --> 24:13.495
OK, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I WANT TO SEE THEM
RIGHT NOW!

24:13.495 --> 24:15.497
YOU GO TO A HOUSE AND
JUST TAKE SOMEBODY?
WHAT IS THAT?

24:15.497 --> 24:17.107
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO WAIT.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.806
LADY, WHERE ARE THEY?
WHERE ARE MY
BROTHER AND SISTER?

24:19.806 --> 24:20.807
Owen: HI.

24:20.807 --> 24:21.895
OH, MY GOD.
HEY.

24:21.895 --> 24:22.896
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

24:22.896 --> 24:23.897
YOU OK, BUDDY?

24:23.897 --> 24:26.247
KIRSTEN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

24:26.247 --> 24:27.335
THEY CALLED ME.

24:27.335 --> 24:29.076
ARE YOU THE PERSON
THAT TOOK THEM?

24:29.076 --> 24:29.946
YOU'RE THE SIBLINGS?

24:29.946 --> 24:30.947
YEAH, WE ARE.

24:30.947 --> 24:32.732
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED--

24:32.732 --> 24:34.864
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

24:34.864 --> 24:35.865
COME ON, LET'S GO.

24:35.865 --> 24:36.866
HE MUST BE SLEEPY.

24:36.866 --> 24:37.911
I'M SORRY. NO!

24:37.911 --> 24:40.348
NO. WHY THE HELL NOT?

24:40.348 --> 24:43.482
BECAUSE CERTAIN THINGS
NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.789
FOR EXAMPLE, WHY WE'RE GETTING
CALLS FROM HER SCHOOL

24:46.789 --> 24:48.661
ASKING US TO INTERVENE
BECAUSE NOBODY'S AWARE

24:48.661 --> 24:50.140
THAT SHE'S ABSENT
ALL THE TIME?

24:51.620 --> 24:52.926
AND WHO'S TAKING CARE
OF HIM?

24:52.926 --> 24:55.711
WE ARE.
WE'RE TAKING CARE
OF BOTH OF THEM.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.452
WELL, THERE ARE STANDARDS
FOR THAT CARE

24:57.452 --> 24:59.672
AND WE NEED TO BE SATISFIED
THAT THEY'RE BEING MET.

24:59.672 --> 25:03.153
NOW, I'LL NEED YOU BOTH
TO BE AVAILABLE
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.808
THE OFFICE WILL CONTACT YOU
TOMORROW ABOUT
SETTING UP A MEETING.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.071
FINE. THAT'S FINE.
ANYTIME.

25:08.071 --> 25:11.466
IN THE MEANTIME,
WE ARE PLACING
CLAUDIA AND OWEN

25:11.466 --> 25:13.033
WITH MS. BENNETT
AND HER HUSBAND

25:13.033 --> 25:16.036
UNTIL WE CAN
COME UP WITH
A LONGER-TERM PLAN.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.646
WHAT?
KIRSTEN?

25:17.646 --> 25:20.083
APPARENTLY, THIS IS
WHAT THEY DO.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.701
THIS IS GREAT, CLAUD.
THIS IS REALLY GREAT

25:28.701 --> 25:30.746
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WE DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH PROBLEMS.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.579
Julia: I DON'T WANT
TO TELL HIM.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.059
GOD, HOW ARE WE
GOING TO TELL HIM?

25:39.059 --> 25:41.017
I KEEP TRYING
TO THINK OF
A WAY TO SAY IT

25:41.017 --> 25:43.150
AND IT KEEPS
SOUNDING MORE
AND MORE HIDEOUS.

25:43.150 --> 25:46.022
WELL, LISTEN, I COULD
SKIP WORK TODAY, JULE.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.808
GO WITH YOU TO SEE CHARLIE
FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

25:48.808 --> 25:51.114
OR I COULD GO WITH YOU
TO THE SOCIAL SERVICES
MEETING. WHAT TIME'S THAT?

25:51.114 --> 25:54.422
1:30, BUT BAILEY
AND I ARE GOING
TO DO IT.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.380
WELL, THEN,
HOW ABOUT IF I JUST
STAY HERE, YOU KNOW.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.208
DEAL WITH STUFF
OR WHATEVER.

25:58.208 --> 26:01.951
NO. THE BEST THING
YOU CAN DO FOR US
RIGHT NOW IS GO TO WORK.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.258
WHY? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
IF I MISS ONE DAY?

26:04.258 --> 26:07.304
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF
DUMB FOR ME TO BE AT
THE SHOP IF YOU NEED ME.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.829
GRIFFIN, WHAT'S IT GOING
TO LOOK LIKE IF YOU'RE
ALREADY TAKING TIME OFF?

26:09.829 --> 26:11.874
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN THERE 2 WEEKS.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.007
SO WHAT? WHO CARES?

26:15.486 --> 26:18.402
THAT'S SWEET.
THANK YOU.

26:18.402 --> 26:19.839
GO TO WORK.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.059
MAN!

26:23.059 --> 26:24.191
I'M SORRY.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.409
WE'RE REALLY--
I WANT TO KNOW...

26:25.409 --> 26:27.847
EXACTLY, WORD FOR WORD,

26:27.847 --> 26:29.239
WHAT THESE CHILD WELFARE
PEOPLE SAID TO YOU.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.633
THEY SAID THAT THEY
WANTED TO TALK
TO US FORMALLY.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.114
WHICH IS A TECHNICALITY,
I'M SURE, YOU KNOW.

26:34.114 --> 26:37.334
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE
THINGS WHERE ONCE THEY
START ALL THE PAPERWORK,

26:37.334 --> 26:39.162
THEN THEY HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THESE MOTIONS
OR SOMETHING.

26:39.162 --> 26:42.252
BUT EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE FINE, CHARLIE.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.037
WE'LL TELL THEM THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
OUT OF HERE SOON.

26:44.037 --> 26:46.039
HE'S RIGHT. I THINK
THEY WERE JUST
TRYING TO SCARE US,

26:46.039 --> 26:47.780
WHICH THEY DID SO--

26:47.780 --> 26:50.870
LOOK, WE'LL GIVE THEM
A WHOLE SCHEDULE OF
WHO'S WATCHING WHO WHEN

26:50.870 --> 26:52.175
IF THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.

26:52.175 --> 26:55.004
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
HOW DOES THIS THING--

26:55.004 --> 26:56.005
CHARLIE, DON'T--

26:56.005 --> 26:57.006
JUST GO FIND SOMEBODY.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.094
A NURSE OR SOMEBODY,
ALL RIGHT?

26:58.094 --> 26:58.878
'CAUSE I GOT TO GET
TO THAT OFFICE.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.360
CHARLIE, PLEASE,
STOP DOING THAT.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.666
YOU'RE GOING TO HURT
YOURSELF, CHARLIE.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.233
Doctor:
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

27:06.233 --> 27:08.235
DR. RABIN,
GOOD, GOOD, LISTEN,

27:08.235 --> 27:10.063
I NEED TO BE RELEASED
TODAY. RIGHT NOW.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.368
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:11.368 --> 27:13.022
I'VE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.415
THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT
THAT I HAVE TO DO.

27:14.415 --> 27:15.764
NO.
I HAVE TO!

27:15.764 --> 27:17.897
CHARLIE, YOU'RE RUNNING
A LITTLE BIT OF A FEVER.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.246
WE HAVE TO FINISH
YOUR COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS.

27:19.246 --> 27:20.290
I'LL TAKE A PILL.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.118
LISTEN TO ME, ALL RIGHT?

27:22.118 --> 27:26.557
YOU SPENT 2 WEEKS
GETTING RID OF THIS PNEUMONIA
AND WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

27:26.557 --> 27:29.865
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO FOOL AROUND.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.259
I'LL CHECK AND SEE WHERE
WE ARE WITH YOUR BLOOD WORK.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.697
DAMN IT!

27:35.697 --> 27:38.874
CHARLIE, I TOLD YOU
WE'LL HANDLE IT.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.006
OH, YOU'LL HANDLE IT.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.181
YEAH.
YOU'LL HANDLE IT?

27:41.181 --> 27:44.184
LOOK HOW YOU'VE
HANDLED IT ALREADY.

27:44.184 --> 27:45.881
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE
THEM TO YOU FOREVER.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.622
YOU CAN'T EVEN DEAL
WITH THEM FOR 2 WEEKS.

27:51.974 --> 27:54.281
WOW, LOOK AT THAT
BASKETBALL PLAYER.

27:54.281 --> 27:55.325
YOU LIKE BASKETBALL,
RIGHT?

27:55.325 --> 27:57.153
YEAH.
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE?

27:57.153 --> 27:59.329
YEAH.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.896
I'M GONNA GO.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.029
YOU NEED A RIDE
TO SCHOOL?

28:03.029 --> 28:04.857
NO. THANKS.

28:06.467 --> 28:09.209
BUT YOU ARE GOING
TO SCHOOL, RIGHT?

28:11.820 --> 28:12.821
CLAUDIA.

28:15.084 --> 28:18.479
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:18.479 --> 28:19.698
NOTHING.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.005
LOOK, I KNOW
EVERYTHING IS--

28:23.005 --> 28:26.139
WEIRD AND SCARY
AND CONFUSING NOW.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.968
AND I'M SURE YOU
DIDN'T MEAN TO CAUSE
ALL THIS STUFF TO HAPPEN.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.709
GONNA START LECTURING
ME NOW, TOO?

28:30.709 --> 28:33.015
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.844
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
YOU, CLAUD.

28:35.844 --> 28:38.804
WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY?

28:38.804 --> 28:40.457
WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN SCHOOL,
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:40.457 --> 28:42.851
AROUND.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.811
MOVIES.

28:47.638 --> 28:50.163
GOLDEN GATE PARK
SOMETIMES.

28:50.163 --> 28:51.730
WHY?

28:52.905 --> 28:55.429
I DON'T KNOW.

28:55.429 --> 28:59.128
SOMETIMES I PRETEND
LIKE I'M THIS--

28:59.128 --> 29:03.002
TOURIST
FROM BACK EAST.

29:03.002 --> 29:06.092
YOU KNOW, HERE WITH
MY BIG, HAPPY FAMILY
ON VACATION.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.833
LA LA LA.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.792
OH, CLAUD.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.583
THEY MUST
ALL HATE ME NOW.

29:19.583 --> 29:23.979
NO. NO. COME ON,
NOBODY HATES YOU.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.636
LOOK, WE GET IT.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.725
WE GET IT LOUD AND CLEAR.

29:30.725 --> 29:33.641
AND WE MESSED UP.

29:33.641 --> 29:37.210
AND YOU DID
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.
YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.908
AND THE TRUTH IS,
WE APPRECIATE YOU
CARING SO MUCH.

29:39.908 --> 29:43.520
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

29:43.520 --> 29:45.261
DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD
CUT US A LITTLE SLACK?

29:48.177 --> 29:48.961
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.136
WHEN YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT

29:50.136 --> 29:51.441
THE WELFARE
OF 2 YOUNG CHILDREN,

29:51.441 --> 29:52.834
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS SLACK.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.794
OK, BUT--

29:55.794 --> 29:58.622
WHY WEREN'T WE INFORMED
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER'S ILLNESS?

29:58.622 --> 30:01.103
SOCIAL SERVICES
HAS BEEN INVOLVED
WITH ALL OF YOU BEFORE,

30:01.103 --> 30:04.063
WHY WEREN'T WE TOLD?

30:04.063 --> 30:04.933
I DON'T KNOW.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.285
IS THERE A PLAN IN PLACE
IF CHARLIE DOESN'T RECOVER?

30:09.285 --> 30:11.157
HEY, HE'S GOING
TO GET BETTER.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.636
HE REALLY IS.
I'M SORRY,

30:12.636 --> 30:13.812
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.119
I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THIS,

30:17.119 --> 30:19.034
BUT I BELIEVE THESE KIDS
ARE BEING NEGLECTED.

30:21.341 --> 30:25.171
THAT'S--COME ON.
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
LIVING ON THE STREET

30:25.171 --> 30:26.302
OR THEY'RE NOT EATING.

30:26.302 --> 30:29.088
NO, BUT FRANKLY,

30:29.088 --> 30:31.307
I THINK THE TWO OF YOU ARE
IN WAY OVER YOUR HEADS.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.223
AND LOOK AT THE COST.

30:34.223 --> 30:37.052
YOU'VE GOT A 15-YEAR-OLD
WHO PRACTICALLY
DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL

30:37.052 --> 30:41.187
AND NOBODY NOTICED.
THAT'S NEGLECT.

30:41.187 --> 30:44.320
AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
SHE'S THE ONE WHO ENDS UP

30:44.320 --> 30:46.061
LOOKING AFTER OWEN
A LOT OF THE TIME.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.368
NOW, THIS IS A GIRL
WHO HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED

30:48.368 --> 30:51.197
THAT SHE CAN
TAKE CARE OF HERSELF,
LET ALONE A 4-YEAR-OLD.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.199
AND DOES ANYBODY MAKE TIME
FOR THAT LITTLE BOY?

30:53.199 --> 30:57.812
OR IS IT JUST ABOUT
SHUTTLING HIM
TO AND FROM DAYCARE?

30:57.812 --> 30:59.466
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO NEGLECT.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.861
LOOK, WE'RE
REALLY TRYING.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.127
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE?

31:08.127 --> 31:12.044
I SEE A FAMILY THAT
IS ONE STEP AWAY
FROM COMPLETE DISASTER.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.135
AND I WILL NOT
LET THAT HAPPEN.

31:35.110 --> 31:38.200
BOY, YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE
KEEPING TRACK OF TIME, DO YOU?

31:38.200 --> 31:40.246
WHAT, I'M THE LAST
ONE HERE?

31:40.246 --> 31:42.117
YEP.

31:42.117 --> 31:44.815
I'M SORRY.
CAN YOU NOT LEAVE
TILL I LEAVE?

31:44.815 --> 31:46.905
NOPE.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.037
SO, SHOW ME HOW TO DO THAT.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.127
WHAT, AN OIL CHANGE?

31:52.127 --> 31:53.824
YEAH. TEACH ME HOW.

31:53.824 --> 31:56.915
I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT
THAT WHOLE LIFE-DREAM
KIND OF THING.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.309
I WANT TO BE A MECHANIC
WHEN I GROW UP.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.441
YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

32:01.441 --> 32:05.880
A LITTLE, YEAH.

32:05.880 --> 32:06.968
WELL--

32:09.231 --> 32:12.408
UH, SEE, THE GUY
WHOSE BIKE THIS IS,

32:12.408 --> 32:14.976
HE TRIED TO TAKE
THE FILTER OFF HIMSELF.

32:14.976 --> 32:18.153
AND HE WOUND UP STRIPPING
THESE 3 CROSS-HEAD SCREWS
DOWN HERE. SEE?

32:18.153 --> 32:19.415
IT'S NOT A GOOD THING.

32:19.415 --> 32:23.506
NOTE TO SELF--
NO STRIPPING.

32:23.506 --> 32:27.075
ANYWAY, WHAT YOU
HAVE TO DO--

32:27.075 --> 32:29.295
NO OFFENSE, BUT IT
WASN'T THAT FUNNY.

32:29.295 --> 32:31.427
I KNOW.

32:31.427 --> 32:34.039
IT'S JUST
SOMETHING I DO
WHEN I'M NERVOUS.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.258
WHY ARE YOU NERVOUS?

32:36.258 --> 32:39.479
I'M THINKING ABOUT
TRYING SOMETHING A
LITTLE RISKY MAYBE.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.220
WHAT, LIKE BUNGEE JUMPING?

32:41.220 --> 32:43.135
NO, LIKE THIS.

32:50.055 --> 32:53.232
ROSALIE, I'M--
I'M MARRIED.

32:53.232 --> 32:56.278
I KNOW.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.150
I'M NOT PERFECT,
EITHER.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.559
CHARLIE?

33:16.559 --> 33:19.301
HOW YOU FEELING?

33:19.301 --> 33:20.302
OH, I'M TERRIFIC.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.437
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S--
EVERYTHING'S TERRIFIC.

33:24.437 --> 33:27.396
BUT HEY, YOU--
YOU KNOW THAT.

33:30.051 --> 33:31.357
LOOK, UM--

33:35.361 --> 33:36.927
I'M SORRY.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.106
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
THIS WAS ALL--

33:41.106 --> 33:42.759
YOU KNOW, YOU--

33:42.759 --> 33:47.112
YOU'D THINK THAT NOW,
OF ALL THE TIMES
IN YOUR LIFE,

33:47.112 --> 33:52.073
THAT YOU'D--THAT YOU'D
THINK, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.770
WERE YOU TRYING
TO GET BACK AT ME
FOR SOMETHING?

33:55.511 --> 33:58.036
WE GO--WE GO 4 YEARS
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS

33:58.036 --> 34:01.126
FROM SOCIAL SERVICES
AND THEN YOU--

34:01.126 --> 34:03.432
[SIGHS]

34:03.432 --> 34:06.740
WERE YOU TRYING TO SPITE
ME FOR BEING SICK? WHAT?

34:06.740 --> 34:08.263
NO.

34:12.006 --> 34:13.094
I JUST--

34:14.748 --> 34:18.926
I COULDN'T SIT THERE
IN ALGEBRA...

34:18.926 --> 34:20.928
AND ENGLISH COMP LIKE--

34:22.103 --> 34:23.496
LIKE EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.587
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.
IT WAS JUST--

34:27.587 --> 34:29.676
JUST SO--

34:33.114 --> 34:34.333
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:34.333 --> 34:36.074
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL?
HOW DID IT GO?

34:37.075 --> 34:38.206
NOT GREAT.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.426
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

34:40.426 --> 34:42.341
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
NOT GREAT?

34:42.341 --> 34:44.125
WHAT ARE THEY
GOING TO DO?

34:44.125 --> 34:47.781
I DON'T KNOW.

34:47.781 --> 34:52.873
WE TRIED, BUT
I'M NOT SURE HOW
IT'S GONNA GO.

34:54.614 --> 34:57.312
THEY'RE NOT--

34:57.312 --> 34:58.966
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO TAKE THEM OUT OF
THE HOUSE, ARE THEY?

35:04.450 --> 35:07.322
ARE THEY--ARE THEY
GOING TO GIVE THEM
TO SOMEBODY ELSE NOW?

35:07.322 --> 35:09.107
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO TELL ME?

35:15.069 --> 35:17.158
MAYBE.

35:34.654 --> 35:37.700
YOU DON'T NEED ANY STUFF
FROM THE HOUSE, DO YOU?

35:37.700 --> 35:38.875
CLOTHES.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.269
WHAT?

35:41.269 --> 35:44.446
I COULD USE CLOTHES.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.187
THAT'S AN EXTRA
20 MINUTES.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.146
DOESN'T KIRSTEN HAVE
A WASHING MACHINE?

35:49.886 --> 35:51.149
CLAUDIA?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.499
I ASKED YOU SOMETHING.

35:55.631 --> 35:57.111
OH, GREAT...

35:57.111 --> 35:58.460
THAT'LL HELP, CLAUDIA.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.810
NOT TALKING TO ME IS
REALLY GONNA TO HELP.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.728
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.255
WHAT?

36:10.255 --> 36:13.954
YOU'VE GOT GRIFFIN.

36:13.954 --> 36:18.741
BAILEY...WELL,
BAILEY HAS ANNIE.

36:22.876 --> 36:25.183
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.237
I BEG--EXCUSE ME,
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM,

36:36.237 --> 36:37.412
UH, YOU CAN'T
GO THERE.

36:37.412 --> 36:38.848
MA'AM, EXCUSE ME.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.372
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M USED TO--

36:40.372 --> 36:41.677
MY HUSBAND USED TO OWN--

36:41.677 --> 36:42.678
HEY.

36:43.897 --> 36:46.421
HEY, UH, CAN YOU
TAKE LUNCH NOW?

36:46.421 --> 36:47.379
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
WITH SOMETHING.

36:47.379 --> 36:50.033
YEAH.
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
PUT THESE ON.

36:50.033 --> 36:52.210
I MANAGED TO
GET ANOTHER MEETING
ABOUT CLAUDIA AND OWEN,

36:52.210 --> 36:53.907
AND I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.430
[SIGHS]

36:55.430 --> 36:59.304
OK. I'M JUST
GOING TO GO CHECK
AND MAKE SURE--

36:59.304 --> 37:00.609
I'VE ONLY GOT
A FEW MINUTES, SO...

37:00.609 --> 37:03.960
I KNOW AND THANK YOU
SEEING ME AGAIN.

37:03.960 --> 37:07.225
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY BUSY
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THIS STUFF WITH MY FAMILY.

37:07.225 --> 37:12.230
AND...BUT THIS ISN'T
CLAUDIA'S FAULT.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.799
I MEAN, LOOK AT WHAT THE
LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN
FOR HER, YOU KNOW?

37:16.799 --> 37:19.498
I MEAN, ANYONE WOULD REACT.

37:19.498 --> 37:22.544
AND I KNOW THERE WASN'T
SOME GROWNUP SAYING

37:22.544 --> 37:24.242
STOP, DON'T CUT SCHOOL.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.026
I KNOW THAT.
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

37:26.026 --> 37:31.031
BUT PLEASE DON'T PUNISH
CLAUDIA AND OWEN

37:31.031 --> 37:33.251
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T
PAYING ATTENTION.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.731
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
PUNISHING ANYBODY.

37:35.731 --> 37:38.386
IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST
FOR THOSE 2 CHILDREN.

37:40.345 --> 37:43.913
WE ARE.
GRIFFIN AND ME.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.698
BASED ON WHAT?

37:45.698 --> 37:49.092
I KNOW--I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
DOING A VERY GOOD JOB

37:49.092 --> 37:51.834
'CAUSE ALL THIS TAKING
CARE OF KIDS STUFF...

37:51.834 --> 37:53.140
IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENED.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.968
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NO PLAN.

37:54.968 --> 37:57.710
THERE WAS NO--
WE JUST ENDED UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

37:57.710 --> 37:59.886
BUT NOW WE KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

37:59.886 --> 38:02.845
AND WE KNOW
WHAT NOT TO DO.

38:02.845 --> 38:06.022
AND LOOK AT US.

38:06.022 --> 38:07.589
TAKE A LOOK AT US.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.852
WE'RE MARRIED,
WE'RE COMPLETELY
DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER,

38:09.852 --> 38:11.680
AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.855
RIGHT?

38:12.855 --> 38:14.422
TOTALLY.

38:14.422 --> 38:17.033
AND TRUST ME, GRIFFIN AND I
HAVE BEEN THROUGH

38:17.033 --> 38:18.470
SOME PRETTY
CRAPPY STUFF TOGETHER.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.950
BUT WE'VE FIGURED OUT
HOW TO GET THROUGH IT.

38:20.950 --> 38:25.999
I THINK NOW WE CAN PRETTY
MUCH SURVIVE ANYTHING.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.871
I DON'T KNOW, JULIA.
I MEAN...

38:28.871 --> 38:32.179
I KNOW YOU'RE SINCERE
ABOUT THIS,
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

38:34.094 --> 38:36.879
WHAT IF I TELL YOU
I'LL ONLY TAKE JOBS

38:36.879 --> 38:39.229
WHERE I CAN BE HOME
WHEN THEY GET HOME?

38:39.229 --> 38:41.928
YEAH, AND I'M DOING
OK MONEY-WISE NOW,
SO THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

38:41.928 --> 38:45.105
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
CLAUDIA GOES TO SCHOOL
AND THAT SHE STUDIES

38:45.105 --> 38:46.193
AND THAT SHE DOES
HER HOMEWORK.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.238
AND I PROMISE

38:48.238 --> 38:51.154
THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
SOMEONE THERE FOR OWEN.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.420
I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.770
I HAD A REALLY GOOD MOTHER.

39:00.947 --> 39:04.559
ARE WE TALKING LONG-TERM
OR SHORT-TERM?

39:04.559 --> 39:06.256
WHAT KIND OF COMMITMENT
ARE YOU MAKING?

39:06.256 --> 39:10.086
WHICHEVER. UNTIL CHARLIE CAN
TAKE CARE OF THEM AGAIN.

39:10.086 --> 39:12.785
HOWEVER LONG THEY NEED US.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.529
YOU'RE HOW OLD, 18?

39:17.529 --> 39:19.313
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
ABOUT COLLEGE?

39:21.315 --> 39:25.101
NO. NOT WHILE THIS
IS GOING ON. NO.

39:25.101 --> 39:29.149
WHAT ABOUT--
THE TWO OF YOU

39:29.149 --> 39:31.020
DON'T WANT TO MOVE OUT
ON YOUR OWN?

39:34.894 --> 39:36.330
WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

39:39.115 --> 39:42.336
YOUR WHITE CELL COUNTS
ARE EXACTLY WHERE
THEY SHOULD BE.

39:42.336 --> 39:44.207
YOUR CHEST X-RAY'S
CLEAR.

39:44.207 --> 39:47.123
CHARLIE, WE'RE DONE
WITH YOU HERE.
YOU'RE DISCHARGED.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.821
OK.

39:48.821 --> 39:53.826
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE GLAD
TO GET BACK HOME.
GET BACK TO NORMAL.

39:56.611 --> 39:59.658
YEAH, SURE.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.268
I'LL GET YOUR STUFF.

40:01.268 --> 40:03.879
THIS WILL BE
A LITTLE SORE.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.407
JULE, HEY.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.147
HEY.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.066
WHAT?

40:18.764 --> 40:19.982
GOOD NEWS.

40:23.682 --> 40:24.987
[SIGHS]

40:36.346 --> 40:38.566
CAN YOU OPEN THIS?

40:38.566 --> 40:42.440
I HATE THESE THINGS.
YOU KNOW, CHILD-PROOF.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.789
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU GOT A HEADACHE?

40:43.789 --> 40:45.051
YEAH.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.010
YEAH, ME, TOO.

40:54.843 --> 40:56.192
[SIGHS]

41:01.110 --> 41:04.853
SO YOU WERE GONE
A LONG TIME.
WHERE'D YOU GO?

41:04.853 --> 41:07.682
DOES IT MATTER?

41:07.682 --> 41:10.032
SHE'S PRETTY.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.294
YOUR WIFE.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.863
YEAH. YEAH, SHE IS.

41:26.135 --> 41:30.096
HEY, CHARLIE, UM,

41:30.096 --> 41:31.880
I WANT YOU TO PUT US
IN THE WILL.

41:33.229 --> 41:34.753
GRIFFIN AND ME.

41:34.753 --> 41:40.280
THAT WE'D
GET THEM IF--

41:40.280 --> 41:43.370
I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH.
IT'S TOO MUCH, JULE.

41:43.370 --> 41:45.633
DO YOU REALIZE HOW BIG
A SACRIFICE THAT WOULD BE

41:45.633 --> 41:46.852
FOR YOU AND GRIFFIN TO--

41:46.852 --> 41:49.071
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY
KEEPS SAYING THAT.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.900
ABOUT WHAT I'D BE
GIVING UP,
BUT THAT'S NOT--

41:51.900 --> 41:55.556
I MEAN, YOU GET
STUFF BACK, TOO,

41:55.556 --> 41:57.036
FROM TAKING CARE
OF EVERYBODY.

41:59.778 --> 42:03.521
I MEAN, THERE'S
A LOT TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT, ISN'T THERE?

42:03.521 --> 42:05.348
HAVING THEM
NEED YOU.

42:06.959 --> 42:11.311
HAVING US NEED YOU.

42:11.311 --> 42:14.270
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
ALL ONE WAY,
RIGHT, CHARLIE?

42:14.270 --> 42:16.838
OF COURSE NOT.

42:16.838 --> 42:19.014
YOU KNOW THAT.

42:20.363 --> 42:24.019
SO, IT BALANCES OUT.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.024
YOUR LIMO, SIR.

42:35.248 --> 42:37.076
OK.

42:38.077 --> 42:39.165
OK.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.042
LET'S GO.

42:49.741 --> 42:51.438
Bailey:
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,
THAT ONE NURSE,

42:51.438 --> 42:53.179
THE CUTE, SHORT ONE
WITH THE BROWN HAIR,

42:53.179 --> 42:54.528
SHE HAD A THING FOR YOU.

42:54.528 --> 42:56.051
Charlie: YEAH, YOU REALLY
WANT TO DATE SOMEBODY

42:56.051 --> 42:57.270
WHO'S CHANGED YOUR BEDPAN.

42:57.270 --> 42:59.272
Julia: AT LEAST THERE
ARE FEWER SURPRISES.

42:59.272 --> 43:01.143
[ALL LAUGH]

43:01.143 --> 43:03.276
CHARLIE!

43:03.276 --> 43:04.407
HEY, BUDDY.

43:06.061 --> 43:09.021
YOU WANT ME--
OH, NO, NO,
I GOT HIM.

43:09.021 --> 43:10.022
HEY.

43:10.022 --> 43:12.154
YOU GOT OUT OF BED?

43:12.154 --> 43:13.199
YEAH, I GOT
OUT OF BED.

43:13.199 --> 43:14.243
WANT ME TO TAKE
THAT FOR YOU?

43:16.158 --> 43:17.812
THANK YOU.

43:19.292 --> 43:20.772
BYE, OWEN.

43:22.512 --> 43:24.079
HOW YOU BEEN, BUDDY?

43:24.079 --> 43:25.864
HAVE A GOOD TIME

UH-HUH.

43:25.864 --> 43:27.909
SHE LET YOU WATCH
LOTS OF RUGRATS?

43:27.909 --> 43:29.563
YEAH.

43:29.563 --> 43:30.956
COME ON,
BUDDY.

43:39.878 --> 43:41.053
COME ON.

43:44.491 --> 43:46.058
LET'S GO HOME.
