08:35.417 --> 08:37.041
that's so stupid.

08:37.083 --> 08:39.083
- Is not!

08:37.083 --> 08:39.083
You're stupid!

08:39.125 --> 08:41.041
- Hey hey, y'know

08:39.125 --> 08:41.041
what you should've said?

08:41.083 --> 08:42.625
- No.

08:42.667 --> 08:46.709
- You coulda said:

08:42.667 --> 08:46.709
I hope you're thirsty,

08:46.750 --> 08:49.583
'cuz we're bringin' some punch.

08:49.625 --> 08:52.709
- Ah, yes! Punch.

08:49.625 --> 08:52.709
That's very clever.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.834
- [ sighs ] I'm so bored.

08:55.875 --> 08:57.542
- Maybe we should leave.

08:57.583 --> 09:01.000
- Nah, they're gonna

08:57.583 --> 09:01.000
need us eventually.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.625
- Just c'mon,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.625
let's go attack Minyak.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.291
- Let's do it.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.917
- Noooo!

09:07.959 --> 09:12.583
If you two super zeros

09:07.959 --> 09:12.583
don't stay right where you are,

09:12.625 --> 09:16.041
This kid FLIES.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.917
- Help!

09:16.083 --> 09:18.917
He's got a Hebrew Meter!

09:20.959 --> 09:24.083
- Heliometer!

09:24.125 --> 09:27.000
- Wait wait wait...

09:24.125 --> 09:27.000
what do you mean the kid flies?

09:27.041 --> 09:29.917
- Yeah, what do you mean flies?

09:29.959 --> 09:32.959
- You see, if I use this

09:29.959 --> 09:32.959
to blast the helium

09:33.000 --> 09:34.667
in those balloons,

09:34.709 --> 09:37.041
it will geometrically increase

09:34.709 --> 09:37.041
their heely-osity,

09:37.083 --> 09:40.667
and then your president

09:37.083 --> 09:40.667
will fly straight up,

09:40.709 --> 09:42.917
through the ceiling,

09:40.709 --> 09:42.917
and she won't stop

09:42.959 --> 09:44.792
until she hits the moon.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.917
- The moon!?!

09:46.959 --> 09:48.542
- All right now--

09:48.583 --> 09:50.041
- Okay, you listen to me

09:48.583 --> 09:50.041
Doctor Minyak,

09:50.083 --> 09:52.500
if you hurt that girl,

09:50.083 --> 09:52.500
you're dead meat.

09:54.667 --> 09:58.166
Not--not that know

09:54.667 --> 09:58.166
that girl...personally.

09:58.208 --> 10:01.417
I just care so much

09:58.208 --> 10:01.417
'cuz it's my job to care...

10:01.458 --> 10:03.250
about people...

10:03.291 --> 10:06.250
like that girl in that chair

10:03.291 --> 10:06.250
who I do not know.

10:06.291 --> 10:08.792
- No, you listen!

10:08.834 --> 10:10.458
For the next three hours,

10:10.500 --> 10:12.375
my minions will be traveling

10:10.500 --> 10:12.375
all over Swellview--

10:12.417 --> 10:14.291
robbing, stealing, burgling,

10:14.333 --> 10:17.250
all the evil gerunds.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.166
And the two of you

10:17.291 --> 10:19.166
will do nothing to stop me.

10:19.208 --> 10:22.458
Because I'm watching you,

10:19.208 --> 10:22.458
Kid Danger and Captain Man.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.125
And if you leave my view...

10:27.458 --> 10:28.792
The girl flies.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.417
- Hup...Oof.

10:32.834 --> 10:35.375
- Fine...

10:32.834 --> 10:35.375
we'll just call the police.

10:35.417 --> 10:39.417
- If you call the police...

10:39.458 --> 10:40.792
The girl flies.

10:40.834 --> 10:42.625
- G'ah!

10:40.834 --> 10:42.625
- Thought that was gonna work.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.542
- Yes...

10:46.333 --> 10:48.542
There there there...

10:48.583 --> 10:51.250
Chu chu...Yes!

10:48.583 --> 10:51.250
Hahahahaha!

10:57.792 --> 11:00.709
Yesss!

10:57.792 --> 11:00.709
Yessss!

11:08.625 --> 11:11.375
- Um...is this yours?

11:11.417 --> 11:13.709
- No.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.125
- 'Kay.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.083
- Now! I want Jimbo

11:28.333 --> 11:30.083
to rob the Inside Out

11:30.125 --> 11:32.959
Burger Restaurant on Doheny.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.041
And I want Rico to break

11:33.000 --> 11:35.041
into the funeral home

11:35.083 --> 11:36.667
and steal all their snacks!

11:36.709 --> 11:39.458
- Guys! Guys!

11:40.959 --> 11:42.542
Psst! Psst!

11:42.583 --> 11:45.917
- PBBTTHHPPPBBBTHHBTHH!

11:45.959 --> 11:48.333
- Geez!

11:45.959 --> 11:48.333
- Gross!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.792
- You sprayed my face!

11:50.834 --> 11:52.917
- Just listen, Schwoz and I

11:50.834 --> 11:52.917
think we know a way

11:52.959 --> 11:54.792
that you can go

11:52.959 --> 11:54.792
stop Doctor Minyak.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.959
- We can't "go" anywhere.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.500
- We have to stay here.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.041
- Nooo...

12:00.083 --> 12:02.250
Doctor Minyak just

12:00.083 --> 12:02.250
has to think you're here.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.750
- But how can we uh--

12:02.291 --> 12:04.750
- Shhh! Just wait there.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.166
- We'll be back.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.875
- Wait! What?

12:07.917 --> 12:10.333
Will you--will you

12:07.917 --> 12:10.333
tell us what the plan is?

12:10.375 --> 12:11.917
- What are you

12:10.375 --> 12:11.917
two talking about?

12:11.959 --> 12:14.500
- Uhhh...

12:14.542 --> 12:17.083
- Just just cheese.

12:14.542 --> 12:17.083
- Cheeses!

12:17.125 --> 12:20.000
Yeah. Cheeses that we enjoy.

12:17.125 --> 12:20.000
- Yeah, I'm into cheddar.

12:20.041 --> 12:24.625
I like Manchego--

12:20.041 --> 12:24.625
a hard Spanish cheese.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.542
- Well I hate cheese.

12:26.583 --> 12:30.000
Especially Spanish ones

12:26.583 --> 12:30.000
that are hard.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.208
And I hate you.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.625
- Ah.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.625
- Fair enough.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.125
- We appreciate the feedback.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.709
- Hey Schwoz.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.709
I'm at Henry's house.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.000
You ready?

12:50.041 --> 12:53.250
- Yes. Go ahead

12:50.041 --> 12:53.250
and distract Minyak.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.917
- Got it. Bye.

13:00.041 --> 13:01.709
- Yes, hello?

13:01.750 --> 13:05.166
- Hi. I'm selling

13:01.750 --> 13:05.166
double-A batteries.

13:05.208 --> 13:08.959
- You're selling what?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.375
- Okay now! He's not looking!

13:09.000 --> 13:10.375
Quick! Hurry!

13:12.166 --> 13:14.500
- Okay, uh how does this work?!?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.500
- Yeah yeah, what does it do?!?

13:14.542 --> 13:17.208
- It will make Minyak think that

13:14.542 --> 13:17.208
you're still in the Man Cave.

13:17.250 --> 13:20.458
Now stand side by side

13:17.250 --> 13:20.458
and turn around! Hurry!!!

13:20.500 --> 13:22.417
- Okay, all right!

13:20.500 --> 13:22.417
- All right! All right!

13:22.458 --> 13:24.083
- This go accross

13:22.458 --> 13:24.083
the whole way?

13:24.125 --> 13:25.709
- What? No!

13:24.125 --> 13:25.709
No. No no no no no.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.667
- Sir, you could find

13:25.750 --> 13:27.667
a great use for these batteries.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.417
- No, listen...

13:27.709 --> 13:29.417
you're not listening to me...

13:29.458 --> 13:31.417
They're small enough

13:29.458 --> 13:31.417
to fit into flashlights...

13:31.458 --> 13:33.166
Or like remote controls.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.166
- I just said...

13:33.208 --> 13:34.834
I mean they're way better

13:33.208 --> 13:34.834
than those C batteries,

13:34.875 --> 13:39.166
Miss, I don't want any,

13:34.875 --> 13:39.166
I despise all batteries...

13:41.000 --> 13:42.625
- This is the best

13:41.000 --> 13:42.625
you can do Schwoz?

13:42.667 --> 13:45.792
A poster and some belts?

13:45.834 --> 13:48.625
- My mother was killed

13:45.834 --> 13:48.625
by a double A battery!

13:48.667 --> 13:50.250
- These are amazing batteries.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.500
- I dont' want any

13:50.291 --> 13:51.500
double A batteries!

13:51.542 --> 13:53.917
- ENOUGH!

13:51.542 --> 13:53.917
- Wait, uh if you...

13:56.917 --> 14:00.166
[ blowing air ]

14:03.709 --> 14:05.166
- That was so upsetting.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.041
- And...Now!

14:15.458 --> 14:17.458
- Yesss...

14:15.458 --> 14:17.458
my two friends...

14:17.500 --> 14:19.875
being good little boys.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.166
- It's working!

14:23.208 --> 14:24.750
Now hurry!

14:23.208 --> 14:24.750
Go rescue Piper and Jasper!

14:24.792 --> 14:26.625
- Right.

14:24.792 --> 14:26.625
- Let's go.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.458
- Hmmm...Nurse Cohort,

14:33.875 --> 14:37.458
quick, come look at this...

14:37.500 --> 14:40.000
- Look at what?

14:40.041 --> 14:42.750
- The quality of the picture

14:40.041 --> 14:42.750
on this television.

14:42.792 --> 14:46.041
Isn't it fabulous?

14:46.083 --> 14:47.417
- I guess.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.083
- Ahhh. I know--

14:49.125 --> 14:51.500
I bet it's one

14:49.125 --> 14:51.500
of those fork TV's.

14:53.583 --> 14:54.959
- Fork?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.291
- Yes--very high resolution.

14:57.333 --> 15:01.000
Fork.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.834
- Wait uhhh...

15:02.875 --> 15:04.917
I...I think

15:02.875 --> 15:04.917
you mean four K.

15:04.959 --> 15:08.750
- Four K?

15:04.959 --> 15:08.750
Pfft, it's not French.

15:37.875 --> 15:39.583
- There you guys are!

15:39.625 --> 15:42.083
C'mon! Hurry!

15:39.625 --> 15:42.083
Hurry up!

15:45.417 --> 15:46.458
Where have you guys been?!?

15:46.500 --> 15:47.792
- Shhhhhhhh!

15:47.834 --> 15:49.792
- What was that?!?

15:47.834 --> 15:49.792
- What?

15:49.834 --> 15:52.500
- Did I hear a little girl?!?

15:52.542 --> 15:54.417
- Uhhhhh.....

15:52.542 --> 15:54.417
- No that's uhhhh...

15:54.458 --> 15:56.709
that-that's just a...

15:54.458 --> 15:56.709
that's just a game we play.

15:56.750 --> 16:00.208
Here...in the Man Cave.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.000
- Yeah! It's called uh,

16:00.250 --> 16:03.000
"Little-Little Girl, Shush."

16:03.041 --> 16:04.959
- [ girl voice ]

16:03.041 --> 16:04.959
Oh hey Captain Man.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.125
- Ah shhh little girl.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.125
See? Fun!

16:08.166 --> 16:10.333
- No more games!

16:10.375 --> 16:13.250
- Mm mm...No...

16:13.291 --> 16:14.208
- Sorry.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.542
So what are you

16:14.250 --> 16:16.542
gonna do now?

16:16.583 --> 16:19.250
Just go in there

16:16.583 --> 16:19.250
and get him?!?

16:19.291 --> 16:22.875
- No, that would be stupid.

16:19.291 --> 16:22.875
- Nuh-uh.

16:22.917 --> 16:24.875
- We'd never fit

16:22.917 --> 16:24.875
through the front door.

16:24.917 --> 16:28.291
- We have to go in

16:24.917 --> 16:28.291
the back way.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.625
- All right, go!

16:42.750 --> 16:46.583
- Nooo...no way!

16:42.750 --> 16:46.583
You did?!?

16:46.625 --> 16:48.166
- What happened?

16:48.208 --> 16:50.041
- Maurice just broke into

16:48.208 --> 16:50.041
the home for the elderly

16:50.083 --> 16:51.792
and stole all the wheelchairs.

16:51.834 --> 16:53.834
- Ahhhhh!

16:51.834 --> 16:53.834
That's wonderful!

16:56.000 --> 16:58.709
- Take that, elderly people!

17:08.750 --> 17:11.041
- Hey!

17:08.750 --> 17:11.041
Doctor Minyak!

17:11.083 --> 17:13.834
Doctor Minyak!

17:11.083 --> 17:13.834
Yo! Over here!

17:13.875 --> 17:15.625
Look at me!!!

17:15.667 --> 17:17.667
- Wait, hold-hold on...

17:15.667 --> 17:17.667
Maurice, I'll call you back.

17:17.709 --> 17:18.792
Now, what is it?

17:18.834 --> 17:20.542
- Uh...

17:18.834 --> 17:20.542
- What do you want?

17:20.583 --> 17:22.750
- Ummm...

17:22.792 --> 17:25.625
Well, I was just curious...

17:25.667 --> 17:28.083
Ummm...

17:28.125 --> 17:31.125
Are you and Nurse Cohort

17:28.125 --> 17:31.125
like a couple?

17:31.166 --> 17:34.834
- Ha!

17:34.875 --> 17:37.917
- Did you just laugh?

17:37.959 --> 17:41.458
- Uh...yeah.

17:37.959 --> 17:41.458
I was just uh...

17:41.500 --> 17:44.125
laughing at Captain Man

17:41.500 --> 17:44.125
and Kid Danger, on the TV.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.542
- I don't see

17:48.417 --> 17:50.542
what's so funny about them.

17:50.583 --> 17:53.125
- Sooo...

17:53.166 --> 17:57.000
have you and Nurse Cohort

17:53.166 --> 17:57.000
ever gone on a date?
