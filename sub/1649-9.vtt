Yeah.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.939
Hershel?

02:12.258 --> 02:14.624
Let's head back.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.826

02:42.997 --> 02:45.033
- Get down.
- ( gasps )

02:55.718 --> 02:57.800
( doors open, close)

03:00.139 --> 03:03.381
- Man: Dave? Tony?
- He said over here?

03:03.559 --> 03:05.015
Man #2: Yeah. I'm telling you,
man, I heard shots.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.517
Man #3:
I saw roamers two streets over.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.893
- Might be more around here.
- Man: It's hot.

03:08.064 --> 03:09.804
- We gotta get out of here.
- Man #3: Dave! Tony!

03:09.982 --> 03:11.813
Man: Shut up, you idiot!
You wanna attract 'em?

03:11.984 --> 03:14.475
Just stick close.
We're gonna find 'em.

03:18.908 --> 03:21.695
Man #2:
Dude, he said to stay close.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.905
Tony.

04:49.165 --> 04:51.451
Shit!

04:53.669 --> 04:55.079
No!

05:24.617 --> 05:26.733
( panting )

05:26.911 --> 05:29.368
(thunder rumbling)

05:45.054 --> 05:46.635
They should've
been back by now.

05:46.805 --> 05:50.889
Yeah. They just got
holed up somewhere.

05:51.060 --> 05:54.393
We'll head out
first thing tomorrow.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.394
( clears throat )
Thank you.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.681
You're welcome.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.315
- Here.
- Thanks.

06:01.654 --> 06:04.396
Carl, I want you to keep
your head up, okay?

06:04.573 --> 06:06.529
Your old man,
he's the toughest son of a--

06:06.700 --> 06:08.565
No cussing
in the house.

06:09.662 --> 06:11.573
Sorry.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.204
- Lori, dinner.
- She's not in there.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.660
Where is she?

06:21.924 --> 06:24.165
Carl, when's the last time
you saw your mom?

06:24.343 --> 06:25.753
This afternoon.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.008
Andrea:
She was worried about Rick,

06:27.179 --> 06:28.885
asked me
to look in on Carl.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.671
- She went after them?
- She didn't say that.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.886
Nobody panic.
Gonna be around here somewhere.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.756
- Why won't they leave?
- Would you?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.383
We can't sit here any longer.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.636
Let's head out the back
and make a run to the car.

07:12.266 --> 07:16.600
( gunshots)

07:18.230 --> 07:20.471
- What happened?
- Roamers, l nailed 'em.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.934
They disappeared,
but their car's still there.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.940
I cleared those buildings.
You guys get this one?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.568
- Man: No.
- Me neither.

07:26.739 --> 07:28.775
We're looking for Dave and Tony
and no one checks the damn bar?

07:28.949 --> 07:30.985
( footsteps approaching )

07:34.246 --> 07:36.282
- What?
- Someone pushed that shut.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.072
There's someone in there.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.161
( loudly )
Yo, is someone in there?

07:40.336 --> 07:42.076
Yo, if someone's in there,
we don't want no trouble.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.994
We're just looking
for our friends.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.334
- Man: What do we do?
- Man #3: Burn rush the door?

07:46.508 --> 07:48.169
Man #2: No, we don't know how
many are there. Just relax.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.505
( loudly )
We don't want any trouble.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.260
We're just looking
for our friends.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.171
If something happened,
tell us.

07:54.350 --> 07:56.841
This place is
crawling with corpses.

07:57.019 --> 08:00.011
If you can help us not get killed,
I'd appreciate it.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.015
Dude, you're bugging.
I'm telling you nobody's in there.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.684
Someone grab the door.
If they're in there,

08:06.862 --> 08:08.318
they might know where
Dave and Tony are.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.821
( footsteps departing )

08:17.206 --> 08:19.037
They drew on us!

08:21.377 --> 08:23.413
( footsteps approaching )

08:26.340 --> 08:28.001
Man #2:
Dave and Tony in there?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.507
They alive?

08:35.724 --> 08:37.806
- No.
- Man #2: They killed Dave and Tony.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.137
- Man: Come on, man, let's go.
- Man #2: No, I'm not leaving,

08:40.312 --> 08:42.223
I'm not telling Jane.
I'm not gonna go back and tell them

08:42.398 --> 08:44.013
that Dave and Tony got shot
by some assholes in a bar.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.182
Your friends drew on us!

08:46.360 --> 08:48.976
They gave us no choice!

08:49.154 --> 08:51.691
I'm sure we've
all lost enough people,

08:52.908 --> 08:56.321
done things we wish
we didn't have to,

08:56.495 --> 08:59.407
but it's like that now.
You know that!

09:00.916 --> 09:03.328
So let's just chalk
this up to what it was--

09:03.502 --> 09:05.333
wrong place,

09:05.504 --> 09:07.369
- wrong--
- ( gunshots)

09:10.050 --> 09:12.757
- Get out of here! Go!
- ( gunshots)

09:23.939 --> 09:26.555
( breathing heavily )

09:42.291 --> 09:44.077
We can't find Lori.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.242
And the others
aren't back yet either.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.207
That dumb bitch must've
gone off looking for 'em.

09:49.381 --> 09:52.214
- What?
- Yeah, she asked me to go.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.591
I told her l was done
being an errand boy.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.419
And you didn't say anything?

10:14.782 --> 10:16.568
Don't do this.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.573
Please.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.905
I've already lost my girl.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.491
That wasn't
my problem neither.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.656
( wood clatters )

10:29.296 --> 10:32.254
- Shane: She's not at the barn.
- I checked the yards.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.416
- Well, where is she?
- She asked Daryl to go into town.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.926
Must've gone herself.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.678
- ( whimpers)
- Hey.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.428
Carl.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.264
- Did you know about this?
- No.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.850
Look, just--
did she take a gun?

10:49.024 --> 10:50.639
I don't know.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.480
I wouldn't let her
go out there alone.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.865
(engine starts)

11:09.211 --> 11:11.202
( breathing heavily )

11:13.382 --> 11:15.043
Hey!

11:16.301 --> 11:19.964
We all know this is not
gonna end well!

11:20.138 --> 11:23.005
There's nothing in it
for any of us!

11:24.142 --> 11:26.849
You guysjust--
just back off,

11:27.020 --> 11:28.976
no one else gets hurt!

11:29.147 --> 11:31.524
(gun clicks)

11:32.901 --> 11:34.937
( garbage cans rattle )

12:06.435 --> 12:08.426
( stairs creaking )

12:31.209 --> 12:32.995
- ( bottle clatters )
- Man: Shit!

12:33.170 --> 12:35.456
(shotgun cocks)

12:42.304 --> 12:45.091
Glenn! Glenn!

12:45.265 --> 12:47.426
|-- I'm all right.
I'm all right.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.264
(shotgun cocks)

13:03.825 --> 13:05.486
( door closes)

13:32.479 --> 13:34.344
( whispers )
Lori.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.810
(thunder rumbling)

13:45.617 --> 13:48.324
l'll hold 'em here.
You cover Glenn.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.282
See if he can make it
to your car.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.538
Tell him-- tell him
to pull up back.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.200
We'll run for it,
get the hell out of here.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.788
You want me
to cover Glenn?

13:57.963 --> 14:00.124
You missed
all that gun training.

14:00.298 --> 14:01.629
lt could've come
in handy now.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.587
No, I can shoot.
ljust don't like to.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.478
( exhales )
Sorry. Sorry.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.559
Rick wants you
to try for the car.

14:18.734 --> 14:20.144
Try?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.730
You'll try and succeed.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.860
l'll cover you.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.488
That's a great plan.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.432
- ( gunshots)
- ( Glenn grunts)

15:01.610 --> 15:03.350
(grunts)

15:03.528 --> 15:05.564
(man groaning)

15:15.040 --> 15:17.827
- Rick: What happened?
- He fired.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.667
He must have hit Glenn.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.544
He's behind the dumpster.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.876
Doesn't look like
he's moving.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.461
Man:
Help!

15:32.140 --> 15:33.755
(whispering )
You hit?

15:42.651 --> 15:44.107
Are you hit?

15:45.904 --> 15:47.986
No. No.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.490
It's all right.
The car's right there.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.750
- Okay.
- We're almost home.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.706
- You good?
- I'm good.

16:05.257 --> 16:06.872
(groaning continues)

16:10.762 --> 16:11.922
Let's go.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.964
- ( gunshots )
- Get back.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.344
- ( tires squeal )
- Let's get out of here!

16:20.522 --> 16:22.103
Roamers all over the place!
Hurry up!

16:22.274 --> 16:24.435
- We gotta get out of here!
- What about Sean?

16:24.609 --> 16:27.351
Man #2: They shot him. We gotta go.
Roamers are everywhere.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.645
- Man #3: We're leaving?
- Man #2: Jump!

16:31.074 --> 16:32.655
Hurry up,
jump already.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.026
(grunts)

16:36.204 --> 16:39.037
- ( screaming )
- Dude didn't make it.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.617
Man #3:
Help me!

16:40.792 --> 16:42.293
I've gotta go.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.122
- I'm sorry!
- No, no, don't leave!

16:45.297 --> 16:49.290
Help me! No! No!

16:49.467 --> 16:53.460
- Man #3: Help! Help!
- Get Hershel.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.050
Help! Help me!

16:56.224 --> 16:58.306
Hershel!

16:58.476 --> 17:01.513
- ( walkers growling )
- No!

17:04.232 --> 17:06.564
(screaming )

17:12.324 --> 17:13.985
Glenn:
Hershel!

17:23.418 --> 17:27.036
Hershel. Hershel.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.167
The gunfire must've
attracted the walkers.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.586
- Where's Rick?
- He ran across.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.755
Well, hell,
we can't go without him.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.969
- Rick!
- ( man crying )

17:41.519 --> 17:43.430
- We have to go now.
- No!

17:43.605 --> 17:45.516
- Shh!
- I'm sorry, son. We have to go.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.942
- No, no, don't leave me, please.
- We have to go.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.438
- He's a kid.
- Please help me.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.353
This place is
crawling with walkers!

17:53.531 --> 17:56.147
- We can't leave him!
- The fence went clean through.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.863
There's no way we can get
the leg off in one piece.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.197
- ( screaming )
- Rick: Shut up!

18:00.372 --> 18:01.953
Shut up
or I will shoot you!

18:02.123 --> 18:03.283
That may be the answer.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.198
We're not gonna get
that leg off

18:05.377 --> 18:06.787
without tearing
the muscle to shreds.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.123
He certainly can't run.
He may bleed out.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.379
- Shut up.
- ( screaming continues)

18:11.549 --> 18:13.289
I'm sorry.
Sh-sh-- shut up.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.254
- Shut up.
- Maybe we should put him down.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.505
I don't wanna see any more killing,
but this is cruel.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.298
Can't we just take the leg off?

18:24.896 --> 18:27.137
- That hatchet still in the car?
- No, no, don't-- don't--

18:27.315 --> 18:28.896
don't cut
my leg off, please.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.807
- Please, not my leg.
- Will this cut through the bone?

18:30.986 --> 18:32.817
I'll have to sever the ligaments
below the kneecap,

18:32.988 --> 18:35.570
cut above the tibia.
He's going to lose his lower leg.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.901
- No, no, no.
- When we get clear of here,

18:38.076 --> 18:40.909
we're gonna have to find some tinder,
cauterize the wound

18:41.079 --> 18:43.161
- so he doesn't bleed out.
- All right, no choice. Hurry up.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.992
Oh, God! Oh, God!

18:45.166 --> 18:47.452
- No!
- Hand me that stick.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.828
- Here.
- ( sobbing )

18:53.174 --> 18:55.961
- ( growling )
- Guys, walkers.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.546
- Shut up!
- Oh, my God!

18:57.721 --> 18:59.677
( screams )

18:59.848 --> 19:01.338
Hurry up!

19:05.437 --> 19:08.019
- Shut up!
- ( muffled screaming )

19:08.189 --> 19:10.726
Oh, God.
They're everywhere.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.189
Hershel, how we doing
over there?

19:15.363 --> 19:18.070
I need more hands!
Easy,son,easy.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.826
No, don't!
Don't cut my leg off, please.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.873
Come on, we gotta go!
I'm almost out of ammo!

19:28.043 --> 19:30.455
We don't have much time!
Come on, we've gotta go!

19:30.628 --> 19:33.791
I can't hold 'em off!
Hershel, do it now!

19:33.965 --> 19:35.876
- Come on, Hershel!
- There is no time!

19:36.051 --> 19:37.382
Rick:
Hershel, come on!

19:37.552 --> 19:40.043
Please, don't leave me!
Please! No!

19:40.221 --> 19:42.883
No, don't leave me!
Please! Please, don't leave me!

19:43.058 --> 19:45.344
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

19:47.896 --> 19:50.478
( crickets chirping )

19:50.648 --> 19:52.730
(car approaching )

19:59.199 --> 20:00.905
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.782
You're not fine.
I saw the wreck.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.490
Let me look at you. Oh.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.404
( sighs )
What happened?

20:08.583 --> 20:11.120
Looked down at the map
and hit a walker.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.159
Next time stay put,
you won't need a map.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.624
Come on,
I've gotta get you back.

20:15.799 --> 20:17.960
No, we got to find Rick.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.047
He's back.
They're all back.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.087
They're all safe
and sound.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.098
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.848
Oh, thank God.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.296
- What are you doing?
- God.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.635
Keeping an eye on you.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.346
Ain't you a peach?

21:10.520 --> 21:13.478
I'm not gonna
let you pull away.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.309
You've earned your place.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.189
If you spent half
yourtime minding

21:17.360 --> 21:18.896
your daughter's business
instead of sticking your nose

21:19.070 --> 21:20.810
in everybody else's,
she'd still be alive!

21:23.992 --> 21:25.528
Go ahead.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.322
Go ahead and what?

21:30.331 --> 21:33.038
Man, just go!
I don't want you here!

21:36.504 --> 21:38.244
You're a real piece
of work, lady.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.832
What, are you gonna make this about
my daddy or some crap like that?

21:43.011 --> 21:45.593
Pfft!
Man, you don't knowjack.

21:46.598 --> 21:47.713
You're afraid.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.177
You're afraid
'cause you're all alone.

21:50.351 --> 21:53.514
You got no husband,
no daughter.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.849
You don't know what
to do with yourself.

21:56.024 --> 21:59.187
You ain't my problem!
Sophia wasn't mine!

22:00.987 --> 22:02.523
All you had to do was
keep an eye on her!

22:17.754 --> 22:19.540
Yeah.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.517
Oh, my God, are you all right?
What happened?

22:38.691 --> 22:39.942
- l was in an accident. I'm fine.
- She was attacked.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.486
I'm fine, I really am.
Where's Rick?

22:47.367 --> 22:49.323
They're not back?

22:51.788 --> 22:53.028
Where are they?

22:53.206 --> 22:56.744
Look, I had to
get you back here.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.255
- You asshole.
- Shane: Lori.

23:01.422 --> 23:02.923
- He's my husband.
- Lori, I will go after him.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.628
|wi|| find him. Hey!
Now, look, first things first--

23:05.802 --> 23:07.383
I gotta--
I gotta look after you.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.590
I gotta make sure
the baby's all right, okay?

23:11.599 --> 23:13.931
You're having a baby?

23:15.562 --> 23:17.268
Why didn't you tell me?

23:19.941 --> 23:22.273
(sighs)

23:29.951 --> 23:32.909
Come on.
Let's make sure you're all right.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.615
Come on.

23:52.807 --> 23:54.513
Thank you.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.182
Hey.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.477
I am so sorry

24:03.651 --> 24:05.937
that I left
without telling you.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.943
It's okay.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.979
I wasn't scared.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.858
When's Dad getting back?

24:16.164 --> 24:18.496
Let's hope soon.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.495
I wanna be there when
you tell him about the baby.

24:21.669 --> 24:24.627
Oh, he already knows.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.506
We were just trying
to find the right time to tell you.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.632
Is it a boy or a girl?

24:30.803 --> 24:34.295
Well, we won't know that
until it's born.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.557
- Will I be able to feel it?
- Not for a while.

24:39.854 --> 24:43.346
You must have a lot
of questions, huh?

24:44.567 --> 24:47.855
We never had the talk.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.272
I guess we forgot.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.739
Don't look at me.
That's your father's job.

24:59.540 --> 25:02.577
If the baby's a girl,
can we name her Sophia?

25:06.673 --> 25:08.209
Hey,dude.

25:09.384 --> 25:11.215
Hey, I'm sorry, bud.
Okay?

25:11.386 --> 25:14.753
- I thought you knew.
- Big brother Carl.

25:14.931 --> 25:18.173
- Pretty cool, huh?
- I say that's very cool.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.091
( laughs)

25:20.269 --> 25:24.308
You-- you mind if I talk
to your mom a sec? Hmm?

25:24.482 --> 25:26.939
How about a little later,
after she's had some rest?

25:28.194 --> 25:29.400
Lori, I had to get
you back here.

25:29.570 --> 25:30.901
You wouldn't
have come otherwise.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.243
How about you--

25:40.748 --> 25:42.579
how about you just
hear me out, please?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.661
It's okay.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.287
Will you give me a minute?

25:50.633 --> 25:52.248
Thanks,bud.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.567
Okay, Lori, it was a lie.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.067
It was one little white lie.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.738
But I think that--

26:12.905 --> 26:14.770
I think you oughta be
thinking about

26:14.949 --> 26:16.234
how lucky we are
that the baby's safe.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.570
You just can't
stop lying, can you?

26:18.745 --> 26:20.781
My husband is back
safe and sound.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.662
- My husband is dead in some hospital.
- Oh, when are you gonna--

26:23.833 --> 26:26.245
when are you gonna stop
throwing that in my face, huh?

26:26.419 --> 26:28.125
I thought that he was--

26:29.630 --> 26:32.121
the point here, Lor,

26:32.300 --> 26:35.087
is that you cannot keep
running off like that.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.501
What were you thinking about?

26:36.679 --> 26:38.294
l was thinking we needed
Rick here to keep us safe.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.634
Rick?
I keep you safe.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.474
What happened that night?

26:48.608 --> 26:51.020
You haven't been
the same since.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.148
You wanna know
what happened with Otis?

26:54.322 --> 26:57.655
What happened with Otis happened
because I love you.

26:58.993 --> 27:02.485
I love you and I love Carl.
That's right.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.494
I told Rick.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.334
What?

27:18.179 --> 27:21.091
You told--
you told him what?

27:24.143 --> 27:27.852
Did you tell him that you thought
you were a widow?

27:28.022 --> 27:30.980
That you were grieving and that
the world was coming to an end?

27:31.150 --> 27:34.313
That-- that you
needed comforting?

27:34.487 --> 27:36.193
Did you tell him
it was a mistake?

27:36.364 --> 27:37.900
Mm-hmm.

27:46.874 --> 27:49.206
You know, Lori,
that ain't true.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.873
What we had...

27:54.048 --> 27:55.458
it was real.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.339
- It was not.
- It was a long time coming.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.000
- It was real, Lori.
- It was not.

27:59.178 --> 28:03.046
It was you and it was me
and Carl, and it was real.

28:03.224 --> 28:06.341
It was right.
Don't say it wasn't.

28:06.519 --> 28:09.386
It wasn't.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.684
Just think about
what you felt,

28:12.859 --> 28:15.396
just for a second.
What you fe-- what you felt.

28:15.570 --> 28:18.562
Everything falling apart
all around us,

28:18.739 --> 28:20.240
but it--

28:22.076 --> 28:24.237
it was the one good thing.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.783
And you know it's true.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.438
How is she?

29:03.451 --> 29:05.112
Dehydrated.

29:07.121 --> 29:08.986
I'll set up an IV.

29:09.165 --> 29:11.326
Best I can do
without Hershel.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.996
Hey.

29:27.475 --> 29:30.137
Can I get you anything?

29:30.311 --> 29:32.893
Nah, ljust wish
my dad was here.

29:33.064 --> 29:34.645
She'll be okay.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.477
You just need
to be strong for her.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.815
l was just
reminding her about--

29:43.366 --> 29:45.231
- Never mind.
- No, no.

29:45.409 --> 29:47.400
I'd love to hear.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.868
My dad would die
if he heard this.

29:53.042 --> 29:55.078
My first summer
back from college,

29:55.252 --> 29:57.538
I drove home,
dumped my stuff off,

29:57.713 --> 29:59.249
went straight out
to the stable for a ride.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.381
My family comes back
from church

30:02.551 --> 30:05.588
and Beth grabs my things and starts
unpacking my stuff upstairs.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.879
- That's sweet.
- Yeah, until this one here

30:08.057 --> 30:09.547
starts rifling
through my backpack.

30:09.725 --> 30:13.138
She finds this little
plastic container

30:13.312 --> 30:16.554
with these pink and green
candies inside.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.438
She didn't even know
I was on the pill.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.734
She was so freaked out
by the idea of me and boys and sex

30:22.905 --> 30:25.897
that she runs outside and chucks
them in the duck pond.

30:27.410 --> 30:30.277
And I ride up,
| see this, I'm screaming.

30:30.454 --> 30:33.287
She's crying
and Shawn runs outside,

30:33.457 --> 30:35.288
thinks one of us
is drowning.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.333
Soon as he figures out
what's going on,

30:38.504 --> 30:41.120
thejerk busts out
laughing so loud

30:41.298 --> 30:45.712
that my horse rears up
and gets mud all over the three of us.

30:47.388 --> 30:51.506
My dad comes out, "What the heck
is going on out here?!"

30:52.977 --> 30:55.013
And she turns around,

30:55.187 --> 30:58.350
bats her eyelids and says,
"We're just swimming, Daddy."

31:04.363 --> 31:07.605
In her Sunday dress,
all covered in snot and mud.

31:12.246 --> 31:14.453
Rick and Glenn will get
your dad back.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.872
Glenn's a good guy.

31:23.174 --> 31:26.587
Yeah. He is.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.132
Are you sure
you wanna risk it?

31:35.311 --> 31:37.597
- You might not make it back.
- I'll be fine.

31:37.772 --> 31:40.639
And with Shane at the helm,
I wouldn't be too sure.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.102
He's lost people before.

31:43.277 --> 31:45.859
And he's had my back.
What are you insinuating?

31:46.030 --> 31:48.191
He doesn't want Rick back,

31:48.365 --> 31:49.901
or Hershel.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.442
With them gone,
he's got everything he wants

31:52.620 --> 31:54.576
and no one
to tell him otherwise.

31:55.873 --> 31:57.363
Shane has done more
to keep this group alive

31:57.541 --> 31:59.702
than anybody,
including Rick.

31:59.877 --> 32:02.289
You can't possibly
believe that.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.249
I do.

32:06.217 --> 32:08.424
(sighs)

32:13.516 --> 32:15.097
Guys.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.200
Dad!

32:49.802 --> 32:51.338
You're okay.

32:54.932 --> 32:57.674
Patricia, prepare the shed
for surgery.

33:01.021 --> 33:04.684
- Are you hurt?
- No, but what happened to you?

33:04.859 --> 33:07.475
- l was in a car accident.
- Accident? How?

33:07.653 --> 33:08.984
I went looking for you.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.942
Snuck out on her own.
I brought her back.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.903
- Are you crazy? You could've--
- Who the hell is that?

33:16.453 --> 33:18.193
That's Randall.

33:32.136 --> 33:34.001
Rick: We couldn'tjust
leave him behind.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.045
He would've bled out,

33:36.223 --> 33:38.054
if he lived that long.

33:38.225 --> 33:39.840
lt's gotten bad in town.

33:42.313 --> 33:44.554
What do we do with him?

33:44.732 --> 33:47.519
l repaired his calf muscle
as best I can,

33:47.693 --> 33:49.194
but he'll probably
have nerve damage.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.693
Won't be on his feet
for at least a week.

33:51.864 --> 33:53.320
When he is,
we give him a canteen,

33:53.490 --> 33:55.822
take him out to the main road,
send him on his way.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.075
Andrea: Isn't that the same
as leaving him for the walkers?

33:58.245 --> 33:59.826
Rick: He'll have
a fighting chance.

33:59.997 --> 34:03.080
Just gonna let him go?
He knows where we are.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.581
He was blindfolded
the whole way here.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.083
- He's not a threat.
- Shane: Not a threat.

34:06.253 --> 34:08.539
How many of them were there?
You killed three of their men,

34:08.714 --> 34:09.999
you took one of them hostage,

34:10.174 --> 34:11.789
but they just ain't
gonna come looking for him?

34:11.967 --> 34:14.629
They left him for dead.
No one is looking.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.088
We should still post a guard.

34:16.263 --> 34:19.346
He's out cold right now,
will be for hours.

34:19.516 --> 34:22.178
I'm gonna go get him
some flowers and candy.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.685
( scoffs )
Look at this, folks--

34:24.855 --> 34:26.356
we back in Fantasyland.

34:26.523 --> 34:29.265
You know, we haven't even dealt
with what you did at my barn yet.

34:29.443 --> 34:32.310
Let me make this perfectly clear,
once and for all--

34:32.488 --> 34:35.525
this is my farm.
Now I wanted you gone.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.691
Rick talked me out of it,
but that doesn't mean I have to like it.

34:38.869 --> 34:42.077
So do us both a favor--
keep your mouth shut.

34:49.171 --> 34:50.752
(sighs)

34:56.428 --> 34:58.680
Look, we're not gonna do
anything about it today.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.553
Let's just cool off.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.613
Can I talk to you?

35:31.213 --> 35:32.794
What's going on
with you?

35:32.965 --> 35:35.627
(sighs)

35:35.801 --> 35:37.792
Your dad saved
my life today.

35:39.096 --> 35:41.303
And Rick saved us both.

35:42.391 --> 35:43.801
And |--

35:45.686 --> 35:47.096
l froze.

35:47.271 --> 35:48.681
Well, you were
being shot at.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.642
No, that...

35:52.276 --> 35:55.268
- You don't have anything to prove.
- All I've done,

35:55.446 --> 35:58.654
then this-- okay.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.110
It's because
of what you said.

36:05.122 --> 36:06.828
That I love you?

36:06.999 --> 36:08.739
Yeah.

36:10.044 --> 36:12.126
A bullet hit
the wall behind me

36:12.296 --> 36:14.287
and |-- I thought of you--

36:14.465 --> 36:16.626
losing me, hurting.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.416
And I couldn't take it,
so I hid

36:19.595 --> 36:21.677
to stay alive.

36:23.307 --> 36:25.969
- Glenn.
- No, no, no.

36:26.143 --> 36:28.634
No, you don't get it.

36:28.812 --> 36:31.975
Rick, your dad--
they were counting on me

36:32.149 --> 36:35.107
and!"
| only thought of myself.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.673
(ticking )

37:07.101 --> 37:09.137
Has she eaten?

37:11.939 --> 37:13.645
I'll give her a sedative--

37:13.816 --> 37:16.478
stop her body from
working too hard.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.902
You were drinking.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.780
That was the least
of my worries.

37:23.951 --> 37:26.784
You left and I didn't know
what to do!

37:44.930 --> 37:48.343
- Want me to take watch?
- ( sighs ) Yeah.

37:48.517 --> 37:53.011
Relieve T in a few hours.
I'm gonna take the graveyard.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.099
And then what?

37:55.274 --> 37:57.105
We just send him
on his merry way?

37:57.276 --> 38:00.609
( scoffs )
According to Rick and Hershel.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.020
If he finds his people
and leads them here,

38:03.198 --> 38:04.574
we'll have a war
on our hands.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.606
You know, you're preaching
to the choir, girl.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.117
You ever consider
a lighter touch?

38:09.288 --> 38:11.449
Abandoning
the search for Sophia,

38:11.623 --> 38:14.205
taking out the walkers in the barn,
lying to Lori today--

38:14.376 --> 38:16.287
those were
all the right calls.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.794
It's your presentation that leaves
something to be desired.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.329
Dale send you?

38:21.592 --> 38:23.253
| see you pushing
everyone away.

38:23.427 --> 38:25.588
For what?
They need you.

38:25.762 --> 38:28.720
Huh. I'll always be
the odd man out--

38:28.891 --> 38:31.473
- the same as you.
- I've made my peace.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.806
Have you?
The way I see it,

38:34.980 --> 38:38.347
you and me, we--
we're treated the same way.

38:40.194 --> 38:41.980
Everyone's always trying to take
the gun out of your hand.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.019
These folks--
they want to play house.

38:44.198 --> 38:45.734
They wanna pretend
that Rick and Hershel--

38:45.908 --> 38:47.864
they know what they're doing.
Let me tell you something--

38:48.035 --> 38:50.276
- they bound to get us all killed.
- Then we have to stop that.

38:50.454 --> 38:52.490
They don't listen. They're gonna
give this kid a care package.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.200
They're gonna send him on his way.
And you're right.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.285
That's gonna bring on a war
or something worse,

38:56.460 --> 38:59.543
and we're just gonna--
we're gonna sit here and wait for it.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.621
But you and me...

39:03.926 --> 39:05.712
we're the only ones
who see it coming.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.712
I should've left with you
when I had the chance.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.519
Oh, man.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.734
Come here.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.021
Thank you.
( groans )

39:28.200 --> 39:30.236
( laughs)

39:33.914 --> 39:35.905
( groans )

39:37.084 --> 39:39.040
( Lori chuckles)
Need your help.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.576
Come here.

39:43.757 --> 39:45.748
( groans )

39:47.177 --> 39:48.963
( exhales )

39:49.137 --> 39:50.923
- We're like a couple of old people.
- ( laughs)

40:00.065 --> 40:02.306
We need to talk
about Shane.

40:02.484 --> 40:04.224
(sighs)

40:04.403 --> 40:06.189
What's he done now?

40:09.241 --> 40:11.448
He thinks the baby's his.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.782
No matter what, it's yours.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.624
(sighs)

40:27.426 --> 40:29.291
He'll accept that.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.051
You're gonna have to make him.
He won't listen to me.

40:32.222 --> 40:34.804
He's delusional
and he's dangerous.

40:34.975 --> 40:38.888
When I went looking for you,
he came after me.

40:39.062 --> 40:41.348
- Well, of course he did.
- And he lied to me

40:41.523 --> 40:43.479
to get me back here,
said you were already back.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.641
What?

40:45.819 --> 40:48.105
You saw what he did
at the barn.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.771
He's threatened Dale
and Hershel.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.985
He's scaring people.
He's scaring me.

40:56.538 --> 40:58.620
And I think he killed Otis.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.328
I think he left him behind
and I think--

41:03.879 --> 41:06.837
I think he did it
not just to save Carl,

41:07.007 --> 41:10.420
- but because he loves me...
- But you don't know that.

41:10.594 --> 41:14.507
...and he thinks that we're
supposed to be together

41:14.681 --> 41:16.342
no matter what.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.191
Those gunmen left
that kid behind today.

41:28.153 --> 41:32.021
I killed two people
myself because of you,

41:32.199 --> 41:35.362
and Carl, and the baby.

41:35.535 --> 41:39.278
It was gonna be me
and not them no matter what.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.957
You killed the living
to protect what's yours?

41:48.965 --> 41:50.626
That's right.

41:50.801 --> 41:53.167
Shane thinks I'm his.

41:54.388 --> 41:56.800
He thinks the baby's his.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.341
And he says
you can't protect us,

42:01.520 --> 42:03.556
that you're gonna
get us killed.

42:06.108 --> 42:09.566
He's dangerous, Rick,
and he won't stop.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.665
