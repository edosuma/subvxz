00:49.625 --> 00:53.500
The movie you are about to watch
was filmed under a lucky star.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.583
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?

04:24.666 --> 04:27.083
NOT VERY WELL
THE QUANTITY IS DOWN

04:27.166 --> 04:31.166
THEY'RE BARELY LAYING ANY EGGS

04:37.916 --> 04:39.291
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE?

04:39.375 --> 04:41.875
44.80 KILOS OF FLOUR

04:47.291 --> 04:49.916
HOW MUCH ARE THEY DRINKING?

04:53.791 --> 04:56.333
FIVE LITERS

04:59.791 --> 05:03.291
GIVE THEM MORE WATER
AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FRESH GRASS

05:04.000 --> 05:05.375
-Mom?
-Yes?

05:05.458 --> 05:08.416
It's 8:43. Are you taking me to soccer?

05:10.458 --> 05:11.291
Laura!

05:13.541 --> 05:15.416
-Laura?
-What?

05:15.500 --> 05:17.958
Take your brother to practice
or he'll be late.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.708
-Come on, Mom. It's Saturday.
-Well, I'm in the lab.

05:21.541 --> 05:23.958
Briand is coming by later,
and I'm not finished.

05:24.041 --> 05:26.083
-She's not even busy.
-Laura!

05:26.166 --> 05:27.958
Can't you go any faster?

05:28.041 --> 05:30.458
-They've started without me.
-Yeah, I'm coming.

05:30.541 --> 05:33.750
In, out, keep the ball close.
Control the ball.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.791
Come right back. Great job.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.125
Look straight ahead and to the sides.

05:53.666 --> 05:55.875
Try to visualize the field.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.791
-Classical music works for locusts?
-I don't know.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.583
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.166
-Want something to drink?
-No, I'm good. Thanks.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.333
I just grilled some. Want to taste it?

06:26.583 --> 06:28.041
-This one?
-Yeah.

06:31.416 --> 06:32.333
Here we go.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.583
-Ginger.
-Close.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.208
Ginger and paprika.

06:42.541 --> 06:43.791
It's pretty good, huh?

06:44.333 --> 06:45.958
I can do other flavors too.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.000
What's that? Jelly?

06:48.500 --> 06:51.083
Yeah. They drown
if I don't remove all the moisture.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.333
Same for drinking, so I give them jelly.

06:54.791 --> 06:55.958
How many do you have?

06:59.041 --> 07:00.291
Four so far.

07:04.666 --> 07:05.541
What?

07:06.083 --> 07:07.125
Is there a problem?

07:07.208 --> 07:09.583
You've been promising me more
for six months now.

07:09.666 --> 07:10.500
Really?

07:11.416 --> 07:12.250
I said that?

07:13.583 --> 07:15.166
Why not tell me over the phone?

07:18.333 --> 07:19.916
I can't work with so little.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.458
Give me a discount or I won't buy it.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.166
Did Briand come by?

07:39.750 --> 07:40.583
Yeah.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.750
-And?
-And?

07:46.291 --> 07:48.000
He didn't take any. He needs more.

07:53.625 --> 07:54.916
What are you going to do?

07:56.041 --> 07:56.916
I don't know.

08:07.333 --> 08:08.583
Don't tell your brother.

08:14.166 --> 08:15.833
Can you finish on your own?

08:16.375 --> 08:17.208
Yeah.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.583
I was wondering if you could

08:21.125 --> 08:24.291
maybe lend me some more money.
Until the end of the month.

08:24.375 --> 08:27.333
Yeah, sure. Of course.
How much do you need?

08:27.416 --> 08:29.291
I don't know. Not much.

08:29.375 --> 08:32.000
-Five hundred, if that's possible.
-Yeah, no problem.

08:32.625 --> 08:35.500
-You don't want more?
-No. I'll manage.

08:37.041 --> 08:38.750
Can you keep this to yourself?

08:38.833 --> 08:42.083
-Don't worry. I'll keep my mouth shut.
-Thank you.

08:44.791 --> 08:45.625
Right.

08:47.291 --> 08:48.583
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.916
-Hey, Pascal. How are you?
-I'm great.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.250
Great. Listen.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.208
Yeah, doing really great.

08:59.291 --> 09:01.625
Listen, I'm actually calling to see

09:01.708 --> 09:04.458
if you perhaps have any colleagues
looking to buy flour.

09:04.541 --> 09:07.125
Depends. What kind of flour?

09:07.208 --> 09:08.250
Locusts.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.541
Exactly. High protein and all.
It's a great product.

09:15.666 --> 09:17.166
What's the going price?

09:19.458 --> 09:20.458
How much?

09:21.083 --> 09:22.458
Man, that's pretty low.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.375
You wouldn't know anyone who…

09:30.375 --> 09:32.041
Great, that's awesome.

09:32.875 --> 09:33.875
Thanks a lot.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.458
-Can you turn it on, please?
-Sure.

09:37.333 --> 09:38.833
-Gaston!
-Yeah?

09:39.541 --> 09:40.708
Turn the lights off.

09:40.791 --> 09:42.541
-In Laura's room too?
-Yeah.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.791
I don't want to overload the meter.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.458
-Did you close the door?
-Yes.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.250
You didn't tell me about the game.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.666
-He still has that thing with his lung.
-Still?

09:58.041 --> 10:00.458
The coach asked me
about soccer camp again.

10:00.541 --> 10:01.750
What should I tell him?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.125
-I have to think about it.
-Okay.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.000
-Are you hungry?
-Sort of.

10:09.916 --> 10:11.166
I can make pasta.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.500
Yeah, as usual.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.166
Hi, everyone.
I'm back with a new video.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.250
This time, I'm going to taste

10:57.333 --> 10:59.125
a locust pancake.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.708
One yummy locust pancake!

11:01.458 --> 11:04.000
-Nice and crunchy.
-It looks really tasty.

11:04.083 --> 11:07.250
Well, I think
we can all thank Laura's mom.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.833
-Thanks, Mama Chirp!
-Thanks, Mama Chirp!

11:12.500 --> 11:13.583
There!

11:14.250 --> 11:15.916
Fuck, it's gross!

11:16.000 --> 11:18.583
The site will be translated
into various languages.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.208
If I can increase mail orders,

11:22.291 --> 11:23.833
we can stop selling in stores.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.041
Here, give me the box, please.

11:35.416 --> 11:37.000
Can you put those in the car?

11:37.666 --> 11:39.666
-Yes, sir.
-Laura.

11:40.416 --> 11:43.500
-Don't use that tone with me.
-I said, "Okay, sure."

11:44.875 --> 11:45.958
-Okay.
-Okay.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.166
What are you doing about this week?

12:56.458 --> 12:59.083
I don't know. I'll take the bus.

12:59.666 --> 13:01.500
The hoppers ate it all up.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.000
Damn it, Gaston.
Enough with the gross stuff.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.958
Why didn't you leave that wart alone?

13:06.500 --> 13:08.000
Is anyone coming with me?

13:09.916 --> 13:12.583
Okay. Gaston,
can you close the trunk, please?

13:13.416 --> 13:14.250
Thanks.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.541
I’ll be back in five minutes.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.500
I'm starving.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.083
Laura?

13:30.958 --> 13:32.708
Isn't it that asshole over there?

13:36.125 --> 13:37.916
-Hey, Chirp!
-Hey, asshole.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.083
"Asshole," classy.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.291
-What's the matter?
-What's the matter?

13:41.875 --> 13:44.041
Why are you here busting our balls?

13:44.125 --> 13:47.208
-Your video is busting my balls.
-Is that so?

13:48.375 --> 13:51.500
The video pissed her off.
You didn't like the locusts?

13:52.500 --> 13:55.208
I was just messing around, that's all.

13:55.916 --> 13:57.708
She shouldn't be mad.

13:58.666 --> 14:00.166
Anyway, everybody knows.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.916
It's been rough
since your mom went off the rails.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.458
What's that supposed to mean?

14:05.041 --> 14:07.541
With your father dying
surrounded by his goats.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.708
-You fucking asshole!
-Hey, cool it.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.458
-Laura, stop!
-Cut it out. Come on, cool it.

14:13.541 --> 14:14.375
Laura!

14:14.958 --> 14:15.916
Get off me!

14:16.000 --> 14:17.750
-Get off me!
-Laura!

14:17.833 --> 14:19.833
-Kevin, stop it! Let's go.
-Laura!

14:19.916 --> 14:21.750
-Move it!
-Cut it out!

14:21.833 --> 14:23.958
-Cut it out!
-I'm not scared of you!

14:24.041 --> 14:25.625
Look at her. She's crazy.

14:25.708 --> 14:27.875
-I will kill him!
-Stop.

14:29.291 --> 14:32.125
If you touch her again,
you'll deal with me!

14:32.875 --> 14:34.125
Just take care of her.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.166
-It's bleeding a lot.
-You all right?

14:37.708 --> 14:39.000
I cut my knee.

14:40.166 --> 14:42.541
-What happened?
-He said some stuff about Dad.

14:42.625 --> 14:43.458
Laura!

14:51.833 --> 14:54.833
-Come on. What's that?
-A tourniquet.

14:55.708 --> 14:58.083
-Do you want me to carry you?
-I'm all right.

14:58.166 --> 15:00.791
Come on, let's go.
Let's clean that wound.

15:01.791 --> 15:03.541
Shit, it's fucking cold!

15:03.625 --> 15:05.625
I'm tired of those crappy solar panels!

15:05.708 --> 15:08.375
-Give it a rest, will you?
-Aren't you tired of them?

15:08.875 --> 15:11.291
Aren't you tired
of leaving your stuff on the floor?

15:11.375 --> 15:13.250
I'm living in a fucking madhouse!

15:13.333 --> 15:16.041
It stinks, it's filthy,
and I can't even take a shower!

15:16.583 --> 15:18.916
Look how filthy it is!
It's all over the place!

15:19.000 --> 15:22.041
-Don't you think you're going overboard?
-No, I'm not!

15:22.125 --> 15:24.458
I'm sick of being
a laughingstock around here!

15:26.375 --> 15:28.708
At least the goats
never made us look like freaks.

15:29.708 --> 15:32.708
When you calm down,
I'll see you in the kitchen.

16:01.208 --> 16:02.541
Six hundred and fifty?

16:03.125 --> 16:03.958
No.

16:05.416 --> 16:07.416
No way. Are you kidding?

16:07.958 --> 16:10.000
I can get a higher price from the store.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.833
I can't go any lower than 950.

16:17.083 --> 16:20.750
No, 800 won't do. I can't go any lower.
I have a family to feed.

16:23.833 --> 16:27.791
I'll think about it. I'll call you.
I'm expecting other offers.

16:29.291 --> 16:30.416
Right, perfect.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.708
I'll get back to you. Thanks.

16:47.416 --> 16:50.083
I brought you some ice.
It should help, right?

16:58.500 --> 16:59.458
Show me.

17:01.541 --> 17:03.041
He didn't go easy on you.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.208
What a jerk.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.250
Keep it on for ten minutes.
It'll feel better.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.083
I'll leave it here.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.750
I think I found a buyer for the 40 kilos.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.083
-Who?
-Well, I don't know him.

17:33.833 --> 17:35.041
He'll take all of it.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.250
How much is he paying?

17:38.000 --> 17:38.833
Not what I wanted.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.541
If I sold everything in the lab,
I could do something else.

17:50.791 --> 17:52.125
We could start over.

17:53.583 --> 17:54.458
Right?

17:56.458 --> 17:57.333
Yeah.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.000
-Here?
-Somewhere else?

18:01.041 --> 18:03.375
Someplace where
the three of us would be happy.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.833
Any ideas?

18:09.458 --> 18:10.791
You can tell me later.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.083
We'll find a place.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.166
Yeah.

18:18.166 --> 18:21.250
-I have to call Karim about the power.
-Mom!

18:21.333 --> 18:24.625
-The power's out again!
-It's all right. I'll be right there!

18:24.708 --> 18:26.916
I was in the middle of a game!

18:27.000 --> 18:28.666
-I'll be right back.
-Right.

18:29.166 --> 18:30.916
-Mom!
-I'm coming!

18:31.000 --> 18:32.791
Gaston, are you paying attention?

18:32.875 --> 18:34.791
-Let's go.
-No.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.750
Hold on. She peed on the couch.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.041
-Oh, no!
-Gross!

18:40.125 --> 18:41.250
Seriously, I promise.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.083
Get her down.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.000
-Come on, Huguette.
-Get down.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.708
Give her some chips.
Here, Huguette. Come on.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.083
She loves me. Yes, she does!

18:51.958 --> 18:54.416
-Black! And red!
-No.

18:57.750 --> 18:58.750
Where are you going?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.208
-I'll be right back.
-I won!

19:00.291 --> 19:02.000
Write it down in the book, please.

19:02.791 --> 19:04.458
-No. Let me!
-Stop!

19:05.875 --> 19:07.208
Forget that moron.

19:20.083 --> 19:20.916
Laura.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.000
-What's up?
-How's it going?

19:31.791 --> 19:33.166
You want his number?

19:33.791 --> 19:36.125
-What for?
-Then why are you here?

19:36.208 --> 19:37.708
I'll be gone in a month.

19:37.791 --> 19:39.250
-So?
-So?

19:40.041 --> 19:41.958
I'll no longer see your ugly faces.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.791
If you need ideas,
they eat pancakes in Brittany.

20:03.666 --> 20:05.833
-You don't like it?
-It's a bit thin.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.541
Can you make it any thicker?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.916
-Yeah, I can.
-I have a batch of ducklings coming in.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.875
I mean, I'll manage.

20:27.833 --> 20:29.125
Who do I make it out to?

20:32.125 --> 20:34.041
-What?
-Who do I make the check out to?

20:34.125 --> 20:37.041
-I don't take checks.
-Well, you didn't tell me.

20:37.583 --> 20:39.208
Sorry, that doesn't work for me.

20:39.291 --> 20:42.250
I can wire the money
through the cooperative.

20:43.125 --> 20:44.541
Fine, a check then.

20:45.958 --> 20:46.833
So…

20:48.583 --> 20:49.416
Hebrard.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.208
Hebrard. H-E-B-R-A-R-D.

20:56.541 --> 21:00.166
You know, if it hadn't been for your pal,
I never would've bought this.

21:00.250 --> 21:01.250
Excuse me?

21:01.333 --> 21:03.875
If it hadn't been for him,
I wouldn't have bought this.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.250
I heard you, but I don't understand.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.750
Well, I'm paying 200.

21:08.416 --> 21:09.791
He's paying the rest.

21:10.541 --> 21:12.541
-Who?
-Your friend.

21:15.416 --> 21:16.583
The winemaker.

21:17.833 --> 21:19.250
Two hundred for all of this?

21:21.291 --> 21:22.958
I only feed ducks, ma'am.

21:23.041 --> 21:25.958
-Two hundred for all of this is--
-Yeah, well.

21:27.583 --> 21:28.625
It's pretty cheap!

21:28.708 --> 21:30.583
What is she doing? Hey!

21:30.666 --> 21:32.541
-Are you crazy?
-Yeah!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.666
-I'm taking it back.
-What's wrong with you?

21:34.750 --> 21:36.750
-I'm not selling you squat!
-Get out!

21:36.833 --> 21:38.250
-Yeah, beat it.
-Whatever.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.375
It's worth more than 200!

23:20.208 --> 23:21.916
Come on, Gaston, hurry up.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.666
Come on, scrub!

23:23.750 --> 23:25.916
-Wait.
-Wash it again. It's dirty.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.791
-No, it's not.
-You missed a spot. It's gross.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.625
Come on. He's fucking stupid.

23:30.708 --> 23:32.791
He's a moron. See how he does the dishes.

23:34.041 --> 23:35.708
Mom, she called me a moron!

23:36.916 --> 23:37.791
What?

23:39.291 --> 23:40.833
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

23:41.458 --> 23:42.875
You don't look okay.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.833
I'm fine. Do you want a hand?

23:45.916 --> 23:46.791
Yeah.

23:48.666 --> 23:49.500
Here.

23:50.333 --> 23:51.833
At least you're smiling again.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.958
-The snoop's in the yard.
-Again?

24:03.041 --> 24:03.875
Jacki!

24:05.041 --> 24:07.166
I'll handle it. You can finish here.

24:07.666 --> 24:09.083
-Okay.
-Where are you, buddy?

24:09.666 --> 24:12.250
Mr. Duvivier,
are you looking for something?

24:12.333 --> 24:14.416
I just came to get my old buddy.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.125
It's the fourth time this month.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.041
Goodbye.

24:20.041 --> 24:20.916
Jacki!

24:21.916 --> 24:22.791
Jacki!

24:25.625 --> 24:28.416
Come here. Come on.

24:29.125 --> 24:31.208
Here we go. Come on.

24:33.208 --> 24:35.041
Why did you blow him off like that?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.333
I just wanted to help.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.166
I didn't ask for help.

24:50.208 --> 24:52.166
You've been helping me for six months.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.500
So, what's it to you?

24:55.458 --> 24:57.166
I live alone. I eat frozen food.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.625
Where would I be without you and Nico?

25:07.041 --> 25:08.666
What did people say when I moved here?

25:08.750 --> 25:11.083
"That nice brown boy,
let's lease him some land."

25:20.666 --> 25:21.541
What?

25:23.500 --> 25:25.583
-You believed in this business?
-Stop.

25:25.666 --> 25:27.500
Come on, I really want to know.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.791
There's more protein in 100 grams
of locust than in 150 grams of meat.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.125
Yeah, I know that.

25:37.291 --> 25:40.708
Soon there'll be nothing to eat.
You're all stupid not to see that.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.958
You don't want to look after
old folks anymore? Be a nurse?

25:48.750 --> 25:50.291
I was a nurse's aide.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.166
What happened to your arm?

26:03.791 --> 26:04.916
Nothing. I just…

26:05.416 --> 26:07.041
I burnt myself on the stove.

26:11.708 --> 26:12.666
Well, I have to go.

26:18.416 --> 26:19.250
See you soon.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.208
Shit!

28:34.541 --> 28:35.416
Gaston!

28:35.958 --> 28:37.875
Hey, you almost forgot your sweater.

28:39.583 --> 28:41.166
I put everything in here.

28:41.250 --> 28:44.333
-French, social studies, English.
-I don't have English today.

28:44.416 --> 28:46.416
-Work on it during study hall.
-No.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.708
Mom, we have plenty of time.

28:48.791 --> 28:50.583
Yeah, that's how you end up being late.

28:50.666 --> 28:51.666
-No.
-Yes.

28:52.166 --> 28:53.416
-But…
-Come on!

28:54.041 --> 28:55.666
The bus will be here any minute.

28:56.250 --> 28:58.083
-Are you done with the milk?
-Yes.

29:00.791 --> 29:02.291
Come on, Gaston. Let's go.

29:04.250 --> 29:05.250
Have a good day.

29:05.333 --> 29:06.208
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

29:06.791 --> 29:07.833
See you tonight.

29:07.916 --> 29:09.250
-See you.
-Yeah.

31:35.875 --> 31:37.541
Mom? Where are you?

31:37.625 --> 31:38.500
I'm upstairs.

31:39.791 --> 31:40.750
What are you doing?

31:42.250 --> 31:43.250
I'll be right there.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.375
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine, and you?

31:48.375 --> 31:49.416
Yeah, I guess.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.041
How come you're home so early?

31:53.583 --> 31:55.500
I told you there was no game.

31:55.583 --> 31:56.500
Oh, yeah.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.500
-I'll wait for you down here then.
-Yeah.

32:19.416 --> 32:20.500
Well?

32:23.333 --> 32:24.875
I think the minute's up.

32:24.958 --> 32:25.916
The minute's up?

32:27.041 --> 32:28.291
Yeah, all right. So?

32:29.583 --> 32:31.500
Sixty-eight. Is that good?

32:32.458 --> 32:34.333
Sixty-eight. That's very good.

32:35.250 --> 32:37.166
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. It's perfect.

32:42.458 --> 32:44.000
You've got to get some sleep.

32:45.041 --> 32:45.875
Come on.

32:47.875 --> 32:49.416
-Good night.
-Good night.

32:51.083 --> 32:53.000
What's with the locusts tonight?

32:57.208 --> 32:58.541
They're kind of like you.

32:59.541 --> 33:01.125
They don't want to go to sleep.

33:08.583 --> 33:10.583
Laura, get off the phone!

35:29.791 --> 35:31.625
That's a lot of space, isn't it?

35:31.708 --> 35:35.125
I have to separate the layers
inside the dome from the rest.

35:35.208 --> 35:37.750
I put them together at first,
but it didn't work.

35:48.416 --> 35:50.666
-Just a sec. Okay.
-Okay?

35:50.750 --> 35:51.916
Hold on.

35:52.000 --> 35:52.833
Go.

35:58.625 --> 35:59.541
Hold on.

36:01.000 --> 36:01.958
Be careful.

36:03.750 --> 36:05.500
Okay.

36:06.041 --> 36:06.958
Thank you.

36:07.041 --> 36:07.916
Scissors?

36:10.666 --> 36:11.750
Take your pick.

36:11.833 --> 36:12.916
Come on, pull!

36:14.333 --> 36:15.250
Mom!

36:15.750 --> 36:18.416
-Hey, is everything okay?
-Yeah.

36:18.500 --> 36:19.875
-Hi, Gaston.
-Hi.

36:20.708 --> 36:21.708
Wow, what is that?

36:21.791 --> 36:23.291
Why don't you ask your mom?

36:23.791 --> 36:24.666
What is it?

36:24.750 --> 36:26.750
-We're scaling up.
-Really?

36:27.750 --> 36:30.000
-Why?
-Looks like our locusts have perked up.

36:30.083 --> 36:31.166
Oh, man! All right!

36:31.250 --> 36:32.625
-Can I see them?
-You want to?

36:32.708 --> 36:33.916
Yes, please!

36:34.000 --> 36:35.291
-Will you be okay?
-Sure.

36:37.541 --> 36:39.041
-Do you want to come?
-No.

36:41.875 --> 36:43.000
Come, I'll show you.

36:44.541 --> 36:46.291
-You okay, Laura?
-Yeah, fine.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.958
-You don't look okay.
-I'm fine.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.458
No, I don't want you to go inside.

36:52.541 --> 36:53.583
-Come on.
-Why not?

36:53.666 --> 36:56.416
Come here.
You can't go in dressed like that.

36:58.000 --> 36:58.875
Wow!

37:03.375 --> 37:05.708
-Are they bigger than before?
-Yeah.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.208
Wow.

37:09.916 --> 37:12.083
-How did you do it?
-I gave them parsley.

37:12.166 --> 37:13.166
-Parsley?
-Yeah.

37:15.666 --> 37:16.666
Well, it's working.

37:19.916 --> 37:22.166
Don't go in there
without me anymore, okay?

37:22.250 --> 37:23.083
Okay.

37:24.125 --> 37:26.083
-Can I put some in my vivarium?
-Sure.

37:26.166 --> 37:27.166
Thanks.

37:29.291 --> 37:31.333
-Well, go get your box.
-All right.

38:30.125 --> 38:30.958
Laura.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.416
Did you see that?

38:35.041 --> 38:36.125
Cut it out, Gaston.

38:40.625 --> 38:42.041
You saw that, right?

38:46.541 --> 38:49.125
-What's the matter with you?
-Why did you lie to me?

38:49.625 --> 38:52.083
-Excuse me?
-Why did you say we were leaving?

38:52.166 --> 38:54.500
-We're leaving?
-Well, not anymore.

38:54.583 --> 38:57.041
-Where are we going?
-We're not leaving.

38:59.583 --> 39:02.000
-Look, we can't just up and leave.
-Why not?

39:02.083 --> 39:03.166
Because…

39:05.791 --> 39:07.166
I have some debt to pay.

39:07.250 --> 39:08.916
You can just sell the farm.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.833
No! Why bring this up
in front of your brother?

39:15.166 --> 39:16.916
It would mean we failed.

39:17.416 --> 39:19.208
No. It would mean you failed.

39:20.666 --> 39:22.708
I don't give a shit about the farm, Mom!

39:22.791 --> 39:24.791
-Yeah.
-Yeah, this place reeks of death.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.666
-You happy now?
-Why the fuck are you doing this?

39:32.750 --> 39:35.291
Why am I doing this? I'm doing it for you.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.125
You have to eat,
go to school, buy clothes--

39:38.208 --> 39:41.208
You don't care about us!
You don't know what we do all day!

39:41.291 --> 39:43.666
-You don't know shit, so what--
-Shut up!

39:46.708 --> 39:47.666
It’ll never work.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.333
Can you just trust me for once?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.166
Do you trust me?

40:06.875 --> 40:07.750
Come on.

40:09.625 --> 40:10.458
Laura.

43:04.291 --> 43:05.541
Is something wrong?

43:08.416 --> 43:09.666
Did you see the shoots?

43:10.208 --> 43:11.583
They're tiny, look.

43:13.208 --> 43:14.041
Shit!

43:15.250 --> 43:17.166
We barely had any rain this year.

43:17.250 --> 43:18.666
Your wine won't be as good?

43:19.166 --> 43:22.083
No, it won't affect the quality,
just the quantity.

43:24.250 --> 43:26.666
-I have a buyer for all of it.
-All of it?

43:28.208 --> 43:29.041
That's great.

43:29.625 --> 43:30.958
No, it's not great.

43:32.375 --> 43:34.458
If he wants to lower the price next year,

43:34.541 --> 43:36.666
I won't have options, no other markets.

43:37.166 --> 43:38.958
No, it's not good .

43:43.458 --> 43:45.416
-I'm going to a farmers' fair.
-Yeah?

43:45.500 --> 43:48.000
-Do you want a stand next to mine?
-No.

43:50.625 --> 43:51.875
Why? What are your plans?

43:52.666 --> 43:55.083
I'll see
about your duck farmer for a start.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.500
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

43:57.416 --> 44:00.125
-What about the organic retailer?
-I'm done with that.

44:00.958 --> 44:03.583
-I'm only going to make animal feed.
-It's hard work!

44:04.750 --> 44:06.666
-It's a backbreaking job.
-I'll manage.

44:07.166 --> 44:08.291
You got what you need?

44:10.166 --> 44:12.000
-Yeah.
-You're gonna make it okay?

44:15.833 --> 44:16.833
What about you?

44:18.166 --> 44:20.416
If it doesn't rain, will you make it?

44:22.291 --> 44:23.416
I don't have a choice.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.666
Well, I'm almost done here.

44:31.916 --> 44:32.750
Wait up?

44:33.291 --> 44:34.416
I get up at five.

44:38.041 --> 44:38.916
Me too.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.458
Hello.

45:50.541 --> 45:52.916
If you want foie gras,
we're not open yet.

46:03.041 --> 46:05.416
-The whole lot for 500.
-All of it?

46:06.333 --> 46:08.708
-How much is there?
-A hundred and fifty kilos.

46:09.416 --> 46:11.375
-Is it the same as before?
-Better.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.666
-Thicker?
-Yes.

46:16.958 --> 46:19.500
Next time, don't pack it in small bags.

46:20.125 --> 46:21.666
It's a hassle for storage.

46:24.333 --> 46:26.625
Use the 50-kilo bags instead.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.791
Here. I only have 300.

46:56.708 --> 46:57.916
Don't look so happy.

47:01.166 --> 47:04.000
Hebrard, with a "D" at the end. Yeah.

47:09.958 --> 47:10.791
Yeah.

47:17.333 --> 47:18.458
Yes, that’s right.

47:22.208 --> 47:24.708
Thirty liters, yeah.
Thirty liters of blood.

47:24.791 --> 47:25.625
Exactly.

47:27.166 --> 47:28.833
I'm going to need it fast,

47:28.916 --> 47:31.250
so I can also rent a refrigerated truck.

47:33.833 --> 47:35.583
Okay, I'll be waiting. Thank you.

47:58.291 --> 48:00.000
-Mrs. Hebrard?
-Yeah?

48:00.583 --> 48:01.416
Hello.

48:06.208 --> 48:07.041
Hello.

48:07.541 --> 48:09.083
-You ordered 30 liters?
-Yes.

48:28.750 --> 48:30.500
-Are those crickets?
-Locusts.

48:31.166 --> 48:32.708
-For?
-I make flour.

48:32.791 --> 48:34.041
-Flour?
-Yes.

48:35.375 --> 48:37.500
-And this is how you feed them?
-Yes.

50:14.791 --> 50:15.625
Laura?

50:17.083 --> 50:17.916
Laura!

50:20.041 --> 50:20.916
Laura!

50:27.958 --> 50:31.458
I have to be done by the end of the day.
Can you grill some?

50:32.291 --> 50:34.291
I'll stop by the post office afterwards.

50:35.666 --> 50:37.000
Do you want to come along?

50:38.083 --> 50:39.166
If you want me to.

50:47.916 --> 50:49.041
Huguette.

50:54.166 --> 50:55.041
Easy.

50:58.000 --> 50:58.875
Easy.

51:47.458 --> 51:48.291
Fuck.

51:50.500 --> 51:52.708
-Where's your mom?
-Making deliveries.

51:53.541 --> 51:54.583
What do you want?

51:55.666 --> 51:56.750
Just checking in.

51:57.958 --> 51:58.916
Why not call me?

52:00.250 --> 52:01.333
You never pick up.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.666
I went past the greenhouses earlier.

52:10.708 --> 52:11.916
They're packed, huh?

52:14.791 --> 52:16.208
You came to talk about that?

52:17.416 --> 52:19.833
Well, I don't know. Doesn't it worry you?

52:20.333 --> 52:21.375
They're screeching.

52:28.750 --> 52:30.375
You're not leaving, are you?

52:35.208 --> 52:37.125
-Beat it, Gaston.
-How come?

52:37.208 --> 52:38.125
Just beat it.

52:40.500 --> 52:41.958
-Huguette.
-I said move it!

52:42.041 --> 52:42.958
All right!

52:43.583 --> 52:44.541
What a pain.

53:00.958 --> 53:01.791
Laura?

54:02.750 --> 54:03.833
Cut it out.

54:40.958 --> 54:43.291
Huguette!

54:45.791 --> 54:47.041
Huguette!

54:49.458 --> 54:51.416
No!

55:08.708 --> 55:09.666
Mom!

55:11.625 --> 55:12.541
Mom!

55:14.583 --> 55:17.250
What's going on? What's the matter?

55:17.333 --> 55:19.083
-The locusts.
-What about them?

55:19.166 --> 55:21.791
They attacked the truck.
And Huguette is gone.

55:22.750 --> 55:24.458
-Where did she go?
-I don't know.

55:25.125 --> 55:27.291
-Where is your sister?
-I have no idea.

55:28.958 --> 55:30.916
-We have to find Huguette.
-Stay there!

55:36.625 --> 55:37.541
Laura!

55:38.666 --> 55:39.500
What?

55:40.458 --> 55:41.500
What are you doing?

55:43.291 --> 55:44.625
You, go home!

55:46.708 --> 55:47.708
Go inside.

55:49.583 --> 55:51.000
Look after your brother!

56:54.041 --> 56:55.500
-Did you find her?
-No.

56:56.041 --> 56:57.708
-I couldn't find her.
-Shit!

57:07.875 --> 57:08.791
Gaston.

57:10.666 --> 57:12.375
She can't have gone very far.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.041
We'll look for her together.

57:18.708 --> 57:21.208
Don't worry. She always comes back.

57:26.458 --> 57:28.041
Did you tear up the greenhouse?

57:31.666 --> 57:33.916
You never gave a damn about the goats.

57:34.666 --> 57:36.833
Did you tear up my greenhouse?

57:36.916 --> 57:39.291
Yes! I'm sick of them!
How's that for an answer?

57:39.375 --> 57:41.375
Go to your room. Now!

57:41.458 --> 57:42.916
-Mom, stop!
-Let go!

57:43.000 --> 57:44.541
-Let go of me!
-Let go!

57:44.625 --> 57:46.666
-Stop! You're hurting me!
-Mom!

57:49.333 --> 57:50.916
Huguette!

58:11.875 --> 58:13.708
Huguette!

58:19.666 --> 58:21.125
Do you want to walk around?

58:42.833 --> 58:44.000
Huguette!

58:53.250 --> 58:54.666
Huguette!

59:02.708 --> 59:04.291
Huguette!

59:24.333 --> 59:25.291
How's it going?

59:26.208 --> 59:27.166
Did you sleep well?

59:32.208 --> 59:33.583
Is your brother up?

59:35.375 --> 59:38.208
-I don't know.
-I want the three of us to go on a picnic.

59:39.916 --> 59:42.500
-Don't you have work to do?
-Yeah.

59:45.208 --> 59:48.750
But it's such a nice day.
It'd be a shame not to enjoy it, right?

59:58.125 --> 1:00:00.333
Can you wake up
your brother after breakfast?

1:00:04.041 --> 1:00:05.166
Pack your bathing suits.

1:00:05.875 --> 1:00:08.500
-The lake is freezing.
-We're not going to the lake.

1:00:20.375 --> 1:00:21.750
Have you had enough to eat?

1:00:24.458 --> 1:00:26.375
There's more food, Gaston.

1:00:26.875 --> 1:00:28.625
No, thanks. I'm full.

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:30.458
-I ate too much.
-Laura?

1:00:30.541 --> 1:00:31.666
I'm good, thanks.

1:00:42.750 --> 1:00:44.250
When is your soccer camp?

1:00:45.458 --> 1:00:46.458
Next week.

1:00:50.041 --> 1:00:52.583
-Do you still get a funny feeling here?
-No.

1:00:53.291 --> 1:00:55.000
Yes, he does.

1:00:55.083 --> 1:00:55.958
No, I don't.

1:00:57.375 --> 1:00:58.291
Why do you ask?

1:00:59.375 --> 1:01:02.250
How about I call the coach
and tell him you're going?

1:01:03.291 --> 1:01:05.375
Yeah, awesome!

1:01:07.541 --> 1:01:08.875
Wait, are you serious?

1:01:08.958 --> 1:01:11.833
-Is your heart beating faster or what?
-No.

1:01:11.916 --> 1:01:13.291
I'm totally fine.

1:01:15.333 --> 1:01:17.500
-For real? Oh man!
-Yeah.

1:01:17.583 --> 1:01:19.041
I'm going for a swim.

1:01:19.875 --> 1:01:22.125
Hey, wet the back of your neck first.

1:01:22.208 --> 1:01:24.916
-All right. Laura, are you coming?
-In a minute.

1:01:37.333 --> 1:01:38.375
Aren't you hot?

1:01:39.458 --> 1:01:40.333
No.

1:01:41.625 --> 1:01:42.625
There's a breeze.

1:01:46.791 --> 1:01:48.083
Are you going in?

1:01:49.125 --> 1:01:50.083
Yes, I am.

1:01:51.791 --> 1:01:52.916
Are you coming too?

1:01:54.041 --> 1:01:55.166
I'm not sure.

1:01:58.291 --> 1:01:59.916
Hey, how about some donuts?

1:02:01.958 --> 1:02:03.083
Sure, why not.

1:02:44.375 --> 1:02:46.125
Hey, what's that scooter?

1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:54.541
-Karim, hi.
-Hey, Laura. How's it going?

1:02:54.625 --> 1:02:56.833
-Fine, and you?
-Pretty good.

1:02:58.083 --> 1:02:59.125
Is that yours?

1:02:59.791 --> 1:03:00.916
No, I don't think so.

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.416
There's a tag on the key.

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:04.833
"Scooter, Laura Hebrard."

1:03:04.916 --> 1:03:07.583
-Ring a bell?
-It sounds familiar.

1:03:07.666 --> 1:03:09.291
-No way!
-Congratulations!

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:10.875
Wow, thanks.

1:03:10.958 --> 1:03:14.458
I just fixed it up a bit.
You should really thank your mother.

1:03:16.083 --> 1:03:18.416
-It's the one you wanted, right?
-Yeah.

1:03:19.041 --> 1:03:21.500
-Aren't you happy? Well, hop on!
-Of course I am.

1:03:22.791 --> 1:03:24.250
-Can I go for a ride?
-Yeah.

1:03:24.958 --> 1:03:27.541
-How does it work?
-Let me push you.

1:03:27.625 --> 1:03:29.333
One, two, three. Careful.

1:03:30.416 --> 1:03:31.833
-Now?
-Just go!

1:03:32.916 --> 1:03:34.958
-Be careful.
-Yeah, don't worry!

1:03:48.375 --> 1:03:50.000
-Everything works fine?
-Yeah.

1:04:07.625 --> 1:04:08.583
So?

1:04:10.250 --> 1:04:11.083
How is it?

1:04:12.625 --> 1:04:13.750
I don't know, it's…

1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:17.083
It's good. Yeah.

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:20.833
That's it?

1:04:24.166 --> 1:04:25.541
What do you want me to say?

1:04:26.666 --> 1:04:28.916
What do you mean,
what do I want you to say?

1:04:30.625 --> 1:04:31.583
Lots of things.

1:04:32.500 --> 1:04:35.458
You could say, "This wine
was clearly made by a decent guy.

1:04:37.750 --> 1:04:39.333
He put a lot of heart into it.

1:04:40.541 --> 1:04:41.833
And a lot of passion."

1:04:43.666 --> 1:04:45.208
That's what wine is about.

1:04:46.625 --> 1:04:49.458
It's a proposition
that you make to people, to the world.

1:04:50.416 --> 1:04:52.916
And when people like it,
it makes me happy.

1:04:53.541 --> 1:04:55.666
That's all. Don't you feel that way?

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:57.000
I do.

1:05:01.916 --> 1:05:04.000
-Aren't you hot?
-No, I'm cold.

1:05:07.041 --> 1:05:07.916
It's chilly.

1:05:38.166 --> 1:05:40.125
Stop. I'm sorry.

1:05:45.125 --> 1:05:46.458
-I'm going home.
-Okay.

1:06:22.875 --> 1:06:25.166
I ordered 50 liters. Yeah.

1:06:26.416 --> 1:06:30.750
Hebrard. H-E-B-R-A-R-D.

1:06:36.333 --> 1:06:38.041
What do you mean, you can't do it?

1:06:39.041 --> 1:06:42.583
I told you I can't find my license.
What am I supposed to do?

1:06:46.833 --> 1:06:49.166
Yes, I know the Farm Bureau. Thank you!

1:06:50.625 --> 1:06:53.291
On the waiting list?
What am I supposed to do?

1:06:53.375 --> 1:06:55.916
You can't stop people
from working like that!

1:06:57.250 --> 1:07:00.000
Hello? Fuck! Fucking asshole!

1:07:02.708 --> 1:07:03.541
Ma'am?

1:07:04.625 --> 1:07:05.500
Excuse me.

1:07:06.166 --> 1:07:08.666
We don't know where
to put the second greenhouse.

1:07:08.750 --> 1:07:10.083
Where should it go?

1:07:10.791 --> 1:07:12.916
I have to be able to get my car through.

1:07:14.041 --> 1:07:16.375
Set it up right there, behind the truck.

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.625
Wait, what about that tree?

1:07:19.750 --> 1:07:20.666
Let's cut it down.

1:07:25.583 --> 1:07:26.791
Mom, what are you doing?

1:07:27.500 --> 1:07:29.500
-No, Mom. Stop.
-Stay back, Gaston.

1:07:29.583 --> 1:07:32.125
-No, it's Huguette's tree.
-There are other trees.

1:07:32.208 --> 1:07:34.250
-Please!
-I don't want you to get hurt.

1:07:35.291 --> 1:07:36.708
No, Mom. Stop!

1:07:36.791 --> 1:07:38.458
We'll tie her up over there!

1:07:38.541 --> 1:07:40.375
No! Cut down another tree.

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:41.916
Stop!

1:09:24.833 --> 1:09:25.666
All right!

1:09:26.750 --> 1:09:27.583
Shit!

1:09:28.166 --> 1:09:31.041
I didn't believe when Marsiac
said you were still expanding.

1:09:31.125 --> 1:09:33.833
Why? Is it a problem?

1:09:34.625 --> 1:09:37.666
Normally it's a good sign,
but you're freaking them out.

1:09:52.041 --> 1:09:53.250
No, I'll do it.

1:10:07.708 --> 1:10:08.916
Am I bothering you?

1:10:16.708 --> 1:10:18.666
Please call before coming over.

1:10:20.333 --> 1:10:22.041
You just show up out of the blue.

1:10:58.208 --> 1:10:59.083
Jacki?

1:11:13.375 --> 1:11:14.208
Jacki!

1:11:16.166 --> 1:11:17.791
Hey, Jacki!

1:11:19.291 --> 1:11:20.125
Come here!

1:13:20.208 --> 1:13:21.041
Mom?

1:13:22.208 --> 1:13:23.041
What?

1:13:23.416 --> 1:13:25.625
I can't find his soccer gear for camp.

1:13:26.958 --> 1:13:28.333
Have you looked everywhere?

1:13:29.833 --> 1:13:32.458
-What's that smell?
-They're shedding their skin.

1:13:34.958 --> 1:13:37.333
-Can I see?
-Not right now. I'm busy.

1:13:43.750 --> 1:13:44.666
Who's that?

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:46.500
The duck guy.

1:13:47.875 --> 1:13:48.916
Father or son?

1:13:49.666 --> 1:13:51.541
The dad, but he's not alone.

1:14:04.166 --> 1:14:05.750
-Hey.
-Hello.

1:14:05.833 --> 1:14:08.416
-How's it going?
-No time for lunch, but I'm fine.

1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:10.125
-That's a good sign.
-Hello.

1:14:10.208 --> 1:14:12.958
-Hello.
-Guillaume, a colleague from Brimont.

1:14:13.041 --> 1:14:14.666
He came to help me load.

1:14:15.666 --> 1:14:18.791
His farm runs about 1,200 head.

1:14:18.875 --> 1:14:21.083
-Right?
-Well, I'm not alone.

1:14:21.583 --> 1:14:22.791
What do you say?

1:14:24.750 --> 1:14:26.750
It's convenient,
doesn't take up too much space.

1:14:26.833 --> 1:14:30.708
-You said around 200 per greenhouse?
-Yeah, 200, 250, but I can do more.

1:14:31.208 --> 1:14:33.208
There's still space. I can add one more.

1:14:34.083 --> 1:14:36.791
-And around the back?
-That's where the lab is.

1:14:37.875 --> 1:14:39.333
-Want to see it?
-Sure.

1:14:40.125 --> 1:14:41.541
And five shirts.

1:14:46.375 --> 1:14:47.208
Okay.

1:14:56.041 --> 1:14:57.750
Aren't you excited about camp?

1:15:00.166 --> 1:15:01.166
I don't know.

1:15:04.583 --> 1:15:05.833
It's gonna be great.

1:15:11.041 --> 1:15:12.375
I don't want to leave.

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.291
You'd rather stay here?

1:15:21.250 --> 1:15:22.375
Aren't you sick of it?

1:15:26.166 --> 1:15:27.958
It's a good thing you're going.

1:15:28.041 --> 1:15:29.083
Why?

1:15:35.333 --> 1:15:36.166
Why?

1:17:09.416 --> 1:17:10.958
What do I do about Gaston?

1:17:17.125 --> 1:17:18.125
I'll meet you there.

1:17:25.291 --> 1:17:26.666
-Gaston!
-What?

1:17:27.291 --> 1:17:28.750
Come on, we're gonna be late.

1:17:58.166 --> 1:18:00.416
-Why isn't she picking up?
-I don't know.

1:18:04.625 --> 1:18:06.541
Grab your suitcase and get on the bus.

1:18:08.625 --> 1:18:10.458
-Did she say she was coming?
-Gaston.

1:18:10.541 --> 1:18:12.708
-Did she?
-No, Gaston. Please.

1:18:12.791 --> 1:18:14.750
-She did, didn't she?
-She's exhausted.

1:18:14.833 --> 1:18:17.750
Come on, get your suitcase.
Look, they're getting on.

1:18:18.916 --> 1:18:22.083
-I don't want to go.
-I'll look after mom. It's okay.

1:18:22.166 --> 1:18:25.541
-No, I want to stay with you and mom.
-Get on the bus.

1:18:27.041 --> 1:18:28.750
Damn it! Stop being such a baby.

1:18:56.416 --> 1:18:57.416
Mom!

1:19:06.791 --> 1:19:07.625
Mom?

1:19:33.458 --> 1:19:34.291
Mom?

1:19:47.333 --> 1:19:48.166
Mom?

1:20:41.708 --> 1:20:42.583
Laura.

1:20:46.458 --> 1:20:47.875
Laura, can I come in?

1:21:12.958 --> 1:21:14.625
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MOM

1:21:18.875 --> 1:21:20.791
COME OVER

1:21:31.916 --> 1:21:32.833
COME!

1:21:32.916 --> 1:21:33.916
Virginie?

1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:42.375
Virginie?

1:22:01.541 --> 1:22:03.625
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

1:22:03.708 --> 1:22:05.083
I texted you.

1:22:05.166 --> 1:22:07.458
-You never answered.
-I didn't get any texts.

1:22:08.458 --> 1:22:09.375
You all right?

1:22:09.916 --> 1:22:12.291
I've been on this for an hour.
It's not working.

1:22:14.041 --> 1:22:16.583
-Are you alone? Is Laura home?
-I don't know.

1:22:17.666 --> 1:22:21.166
Can you give me a hand?
Hold this. I want to give it one last try.

1:22:25.833 --> 1:22:27.791
-Well, is it working?
-No.

1:22:30.750 --> 1:22:31.708
It's jammed.

1:22:31.791 --> 1:22:33.166
All right. Forget it.

1:22:34.833 --> 1:22:36.500
I'll deal with it tomorrow.

1:22:46.166 --> 1:22:47.125
I'll be right back.

1:22:53.875 --> 1:22:54.708
Virginie!

1:22:55.750 --> 1:22:57.125
What's going on here?

1:22:57.875 --> 1:22:59.791
Hold on. I've got you.

1:23:00.333 --> 1:23:01.791
-Let me sit you down.
-Okay.

1:23:02.333 --> 1:23:04.083
Right here, okay?

1:23:05.291 --> 1:23:06.125
Fuck.

1:23:07.750 --> 1:23:09.458
Wait, I got you. It's okay.

1:23:10.708 --> 1:23:12.416
-There, take a deep breath.
-I'm…

1:23:14.541 --> 1:23:17.166
-I'm all right. It's okay.
-You scared me.

1:23:18.791 --> 1:23:20.750
-It's all right.
-Listen.

1:23:21.958 --> 1:23:23.708
Let's get something to eat, okay?

1:23:24.916 --> 1:23:25.791
Laura!

1:23:26.541 --> 1:23:27.916
Come down here, please!

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.125
Virginie, come.

1:23:43.666 --> 1:23:44.625
Sit down.

1:23:45.833 --> 1:23:48.375
This is my video projector.

1:23:51.291 --> 1:23:53.333
It was the first thing
I set up when I moved here.

1:23:53.833 --> 1:23:54.750
Pretty sweet, huh?

1:23:57.250 --> 1:23:58.166
You know what?

1:23:59.875 --> 1:24:00.708
I have an idea.

1:24:01.333 --> 1:24:03.333
We can watch a movie while we eat.

1:24:06.166 --> 1:24:07.000
Hey.

1:24:08.166 --> 1:24:09.083
I'm here.

1:24:13.583 --> 1:24:14.416
Laura.

1:24:15.416 --> 1:24:16.833
You know you can trust me.

1:24:17.833 --> 1:24:19.208
Tell me what's going on.

1:24:20.125 --> 1:24:21.250
The locusts.

1:24:23.083 --> 1:24:24.083
What about them?

1:24:24.958 --> 1:24:26.291
She can't go on like this.

1:24:27.333 --> 1:24:29.583
What do you mean?
What are you talking about

1:24:30.541 --> 1:24:32.500
-I don't get it.
-What's the big secret?

1:24:33.291 --> 1:24:34.708
There's no secret, Virginie.

1:24:36.958 --> 1:24:38.000
We're catching up.

1:24:44.208 --> 1:24:45.583
What were you talking about?

1:24:46.666 --> 1:24:47.541
Laura?

1:24:49.708 --> 1:24:52.416
-What were you talking about?
-You really want to know?

1:24:53.666 --> 1:24:54.791
Look at your daughter!

1:24:55.791 --> 1:24:57.000
Isn't it obvious?

1:24:58.083 --> 1:24:59.291
Isn't it?

1:25:00.666 --> 1:25:02.791
You need to tell me some things.

1:25:02.875 --> 1:25:05.041
Tell me what's going on.
This is ridiculous.

1:25:05.625 --> 1:25:06.875
All right, enough.

1:25:07.708 --> 1:25:09.000
Stay and talk to me!

1:25:09.083 --> 1:25:10.416
No, Mom. I'm staying here!

1:25:10.500 --> 1:25:13.083
She's not leaving.
And take a good look at yourself!

1:25:14.208 --> 1:25:16.000
You're a fucking mess!

1:25:16.083 --> 1:25:16.916
Let's go.

1:25:18.416 --> 1:25:20.000
-Stop!
-Don't touch me!

1:25:20.083 --> 1:25:21.125
This is disgusting.

1:25:29.125 --> 1:25:30.000
Jacki?

1:29:04.208 --> 1:29:05.083
Karim?

1:29:11.666 --> 1:29:12.666
What is it?

1:29:19.416 --> 1:29:20.250
Karim.

1:29:21.750 --> 1:29:22.583
Karim!

1:29:34.083 --> 1:29:34.916
Laura!

1:29:36.041 --> 1:29:37.458
What did you tell him?

1:29:37.958 --> 1:29:39.208
Laura, open the door!

1:29:40.458 --> 1:29:41.666
Mom, stop!

1:29:41.750 --> 1:29:44.583
Let me in.
I just want to know what you told him.

1:29:44.666 --> 1:29:46.541
-Stop!
-What did you tell him?

1:30:15.708 --> 1:30:17.875
-Mom.
-Laura.

1:30:26.750 --> 1:30:27.583
Mom!

1:30:34.708 --> 1:30:35.541
Virginie!

1:30:37.541 --> 1:30:38.791
Virginie, come on!

1:30:39.250 --> 1:30:40.708
Come with me.

1:30:41.875 --> 1:30:43.041
Let go of me!

1:30:43.125 --> 1:30:44.333
-Let go of me!
-Look!

1:30:46.500 --> 1:30:47.458
Mom!

1:30:48.208 --> 1:30:49.666
You had no right!

1:30:50.166 --> 1:30:52.041
Stop! It's over!

1:30:52.833 --> 1:30:55.166
-Stop!
-Karim! Stop!

1:31:06.291 --> 1:31:07.708
Mom!

1:31:07.791 --> 1:31:08.833
Stop!

1:31:11.666 --> 1:31:12.625
Virginie!

1:31:12.708 --> 1:31:13.583
Come on!

1:31:15.166 --> 1:31:16.000
Go inside!

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.875
Shut the upstairs windows! Hurry!

1:31:22.125 --> 1:31:23.125
Turn the lights off!

1:31:25.166 --> 1:31:26.000
Turn them off!

1:31:34.791 --> 1:31:36.333
-Laura!
-Karim!

1:31:36.416 --> 1:31:39.208
Laura, shut the door!
Hide under the staircase.

1:32:00.500 --> 1:32:01.416
Mom!

1:32:04.583 --> 1:32:05.583
Laura!

1:32:07.291 --> 1:32:08.125
Laura!

1:32:09.833 --> 1:32:10.666
Laura!

1:32:22.666 --> 1:32:23.916
Mom!

1:32:26.666 --> 1:32:28.291
-Laura!
-Mom!

1:32:33.625 --> 1:32:34.458
Laura!

1:32:57.583 --> 1:32:58.500
Laura!

1:33:03.166 --> 1:33:04.000
Laura!

1:33:09.250 --> 1:33:10.208
Laura!

1:33:37.250 --> 1:33:38.083
Laura!

1:33:40.708 --> 1:33:41.541
Laura!

1:34:30.208 --> 1:34:31.500
Mom!

1:34:32.791 --> 1:34:34.083
Mom!

1:34:37.333 --> 1:34:38.375
Laura!

1:34:44.041 --> 1:34:44.875
Laura!

1:34:47.625 --> 1:34:48.625
Mom!

1:34:53.500 --> 1:34:54.416
Mom!

1:35:11.833 --> 1:35:13.208
Mom!

1:35:52.166 --> 1:35:53.958
Laura!

1:36:09.875 --> 1:36:10.958
Mom!

1:36:19.958 --> 1:36:20.833
Mom!

1:36:23.208 --> 1:36:24.041
Mom!

1:36:55.208 --> 1:36:57.625
Mom!

1:37:04.458 --> 1:37:05.291
Mom!
