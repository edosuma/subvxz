WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:06.118
What's up, peanut?

00:06.119 --> 00:08.354
Max, I'm not paying you
to just stand there.

00:08.355 --> 00:10.122
Well, you're not paying me
to eat as many French fries

00:10.123 --> 00:11.691
as I can before the plate
leaves the kitchen,

00:11.692 --> 00:13.993
but I do that too.

00:14.494 --> 00:16.695
Go wait
on that pretty girl.

00:16.696 --> 00:19.798
Oh, wait.
Is she a boy?

00:19.799 --> 00:22.901
She looks a little
like a pretty boy.

00:22.902 --> 00:26.872
She's probably looking at you
and thinking the same thing.

00:29.042 --> 00:31.510
But are you attracted
to the girl she is

00:31.511 --> 00:33.145
or the boy
she appears to be?

00:33.146 --> 00:35.214
You're confused,
aren't you, Han?

00:35.215 --> 00:37.817
Yes, my mind
tells me one thing,

00:37.818 --> 00:41.254
but my body tells me
something else.

00:43.223 --> 00:45.091
Max, go on break.
I've got the booth.

00:45.092 --> 00:46.859
Oh, no.
You can't wait on her.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.195
That's Tina, a lesbian
who turns straight girls.

00:49.196 --> 00:52.398
I call her
"Tina the Turner."

00:52.399 --> 00:54.667
Practically
every heterosexual woman

00:54.668 --> 00:56.269
in Williamsburg
has hooked up with her.

00:56.270 --> 00:58.537
Max, everyone?

00:58.538 --> 01:02.875
Not me.
Who do you think turned her?

01:02.876 --> 01:05.878
But you won't be able
to resist her charm. Trust me.

01:05.879 --> 01:09.181
That's nonsense. I'm very
comfortable with my sexuality.

01:09.182 --> 01:11.951
I once texted "yes"
to Mr. Chaz Bono

01:11.952 --> 01:14.520
on <i>Dancing With The Stars.</i>

01:14.521 --> 01:16.222
Okay, good luck.

01:16.223 --> 01:17.890
Just don't let me catch you guys
making out on the table.

01:19.092 --> 01:22.928
Or do.
It's a free country.

01:22.929 --> 01:24.297
Hi, are you ready
to order?

01:24.298 --> 01:27.199
Sure. I love your hair,
by the way.

01:27.700 --> 01:31.070
Earl, Caroline's about
to fall in love with a lesbian.

01:31.071 --> 01:35.574
Well, color me
"I saw that one coming."

01:36.275 --> 01:37.143
How'd it go?

01:37.144 --> 01:38.811
Fine,
she complimented my hair,

01:38.812 --> 01:41.147
she ordered a soup,
I gave her my number.

01:41.148 --> 01:43.416
I gave her my number?

01:43.417 --> 01:45.384
Okay,
hit the showers.

01:45.385 --> 01:47.219
That's what I get
for sending a straight woman

01:47.220 --> 01:49.789
to do an emotionally dead
woman's job.

01:51.458 --> 01:53.826

02:07.928 --> 02:09.762
It was so nice
to wake up this morning

02:09.812 --> 02:12.114
without the stress
of owning our cupcake business.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.099
The only decision
I have to make today is:

02:14.100 --> 02:17.336
Do I change my underwear
or just turn these inside out?

02:17.837 --> 02:20.339
Four years ago, I was hit
with a similar conundrum:

02:20.340 --> 02:23.775
"Do I buy underwear
or do I buy beer?"

02:23.776 --> 02:27.279
I've been free-balling it
ever since.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.348
Max, what are you doing?
What's happening over there?

02:29.349 --> 02:30.916
Oh, you mean the arrow
from the shop?

02:30.917 --> 02:32.250
I put it on so you'd know

02:32.251 --> 02:34.853
where the insults
were coming from.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.488
I'm talking
about the cupcakes.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.856
Our cupcake shop is gone.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.591
Why are you still
making those things?

02:39.592 --> 02:41.426
It's the only constant
in my life,

02:41.427 --> 02:43.962
and the routine distracts me
from the relentless darkness

02:43.963 --> 02:46.798
that lurks in every corner
of my thoughts.

02:47.499 --> 02:49.400
Besides, we still need
to sell these at the diner

02:49.401 --> 02:50.435
to make extra money.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.471
Well, you can do it.
I'm not speaking to them.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.172
They totally led me on.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.874
Those cupcakes
were a tease.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.310
Well, I want to pay rent
this month.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.679
And then again next month,
and so on and so on

03:00.680 --> 03:03.348
until the exquisite release
of death.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.952
Oh, rent. Here we go again.
Does that bitch ever stop?

03:09.288 --> 03:10.722
If that's death,
it's for me.

03:10.723 --> 03:14.493
Tell him to honk
and I'll be right out.

03:14.494 --> 03:18.063
Morning, Chestnut.

03:18.564 --> 03:21.466
Oh, what is it
about those big, beautiful eyes

03:21.467 --> 03:23.835
that makes everything
feel better.

03:23.836 --> 03:27.139
I guess
I just have a warmth.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.708
Oh, you mean the horse.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.678
Is this still good?

03:32.679 --> 03:35.080
It is not.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.215
Eh, like I have a choice.

03:38.016 --> 03:39.818
Wow, that was
a blast from the past--

03:39.819 --> 03:41.753
my old temp agency.

03:41.754 --> 03:44.489
Flu's got their staff laid up.
They need bodies.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.725
Wanna do it? I bet
they'll let us temp together.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.928
You think? You think
they'd let us temp together?

03:49.929 --> 03:51.830
Oh, God.
Last week,

03:51.831 --> 03:53.865
I owned a cupcake business,
now I'm temping.

03:53.866 --> 03:57.202
Why don't I just ask Chestnut
to kick me in the head?

03:57.203 --> 04:01.006
He won't do it.
I've asked him like seven times.

04:01.007 --> 04:04.009
Look, we've both casually
fantasized about our deaths

04:04.010 --> 04:05.744
within ten minutes
of waking up,

04:05.745 --> 04:08.714
so maybe we should do something
to distract us.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.016
And Xeroxing
will make us feel whole?

04:11.017 --> 04:14.586
Let me tell you
something.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.557
When you're photocopying
your ass on a Xerox machine,

04:18.558 --> 04:21.692
you are never more alive.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.196
Hello, old friend.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.932
Here it is,
my temping blazer.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.435
Ahh, you can still smell
the "No way out."

04:30.436 --> 04:32.204
Why is that in a bucket?

04:32.205 --> 04:35.073
'Cause I don't want
to accidentally wear it.

04:35.074 --> 04:38.610
Well, is there a pantsuit
in the oven I could wear?

04:39.111 --> 04:41.246
It doesn't matter
what you wear--you're a temp.

04:41.247 --> 04:44.216
They'll be impressed
if you don't poop your pants.

04:44.217 --> 04:48.553
And even if you do,
not a deal breaker.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.590
All right, I'll go,

04:51.591 --> 04:52.924
but if we're temping
to make our rent,

04:52.925 --> 04:54.826
that's the last batch
of those.

04:54.827 --> 04:58.430
I don't want to see, hear, or
think any more about cupcakes.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.902
Ding dong,
the cupcake's calling.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.173
We found the cupcake costumes
from your store

05:08.174 --> 05:11.076
out near the dumpster.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.444
Are you guys drunk?

05:12.445 --> 05:14.246
Yes!

05:14.247 --> 05:17.816
Yeah, we've been out clubbing
all night.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.286
Oh, I just swallowed
one of my balls.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.522
Yeah. Yeah.

05:23.523 --> 05:27.025
Well, now, you know
how I feel.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.995
I threw those costumes away
on purpose.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.130
Max and I are no longer
making cupcakes.

05:32.131 --> 05:35.600
What'd you say?

05:36.101 --> 05:38.370
Cupcakes are a waste
of time and money.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.640
You take that back
right now!

05:41.641 --> 05:43.275
No, you don't--

05:43.976 --> 05:45.177
You're lucky

05:45.178 --> 05:48.346
that I have a giant cake
holding me back right now.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.622
Fifth floor,
end of dreams.

05:57.623 --> 05:59.724
Oh, yeah,
I worked here before.

05:59.725 --> 06:01.626
You know the toaster oven
in our kitchen?

06:01.627 --> 06:04.629
It came from here.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.200
Hi. Caroline Channing,
reporting for my first day.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.968
I went ahead
and printed out my address,

06:09.969 --> 06:11.570
Social Security number,
and other important information

06:11.571 --> 06:13.238
to make your life
easier.

06:13.239 --> 06:15.841
Hey, I'm temp number two.
Where your bathroom at?

06:15.842 --> 06:18.210
I'll get Eli.
He's my boss.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.245
Sign these stating that
if you're injured on the job,

06:20.246 --> 06:21.713
it's not our fault.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.182
How would we injure ourselves
in an office?

06:24.683 --> 06:27.719
Let me just give you
a "for instance."

06:27.720 --> 06:29.855
Some girl, let's say
her name is Sarah,

06:29.856 --> 06:31.223
is walking
through the office

06:31.224 --> 06:33.491
with her number 2 pencil
facing up-ways.

06:33.492 --> 06:35.393
Well, she trips
over her shoes and falls,

06:35.394 --> 06:37.362
and that number 2 pencil
goes right through her eyeball

06:37.363 --> 06:39.264
and into her brain.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.333
And now she's gotta eat
applesauce through a straw

06:41.334 --> 06:43.068
the rest of her life.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.770
See, that's not our fault,
that's her fault,

06:45.771 --> 06:47.172
as per
the judge's decision

06:47.173 --> 06:48.907
in Sarah Drake
vs. Westship insurance.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.209
Sign those.
I'll get Eli.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.879
Thank you. I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.449
That's 'cause
I didn't give it to you.

06:57.450 --> 07:00.585
What are you doing? You never
give anybody your real name.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.854
That way, when you make
your little data entry mistake,

07:02.855 --> 07:04.956
they can't
track the real you down.

07:04.957 --> 07:08.226
You didn't see me
at the Enron trial, did you?

07:08.727 --> 07:11.296
And that light in your eyes?
Dim it down, way down.

07:11.297 --> 07:12.530
Show me.

07:14.533 --> 07:17.202
Wow. That's actually
really good. How'd you do that?

07:17.203 --> 07:20.038
- I thought about our future.
- Great!

07:20.039 --> 07:21.640
Eli's in a meeting,

07:21.641 --> 07:24.075
but you gotta watch
this sexual harassment video.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.044
Watching a video
seems like a waste of time

07:26.045 --> 07:28.079
when we could be doing
something more productive.

07:28.080 --> 07:32.384
A waste of time? Let me
just give you a "for instance."

07:32.385 --> 07:33.919
There's this
Dominican guy,

07:33.920 --> 07:35.921
he's installing a new water jug
in the office,

07:35.922 --> 07:38.556
and he looks at one of
the female employees and says,

07:38.557 --> 07:42.060
"Speaking of jugs,"
and then he reaches up

07:42.061 --> 07:44.396
and cups
the employee's breastesses

07:44.397 --> 07:47.999
then starts twisting
on the nips and what have you.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.468
Now, how do you handle
a situation like that?

07:50.999 --> 07:53.471
That's actually how
my longest relationship started.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.643
I'd love to give you
that promotion, Beverly,

07:58.644 --> 08:01.146
but first, you'll have
to do something... for me.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.481
Don't do it, Beverly!
Don't do it!

08:03.482 --> 08:06.284
Spoiler alert. I've watched this
in here before,

08:06.285 --> 08:08.520
and it does not end well
for Beverly.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.188
Well,
not to blame the victim,

08:10.189 --> 08:12.757
but who wears a black bra
to work?

08:12.758 --> 08:14.326
These shelves
would be so much better

08:14.327 --> 08:16.494
if they were alphabetized
and color-coordinated.

08:16.495 --> 08:19.364
Forget that cabinet and look
at the top shelf on Beverly.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.366
I'm a little jelly.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.968
That's right, Beverly.

08:22.969 --> 08:25.270
Now, bend down
and pick up that file.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.372
Oh, Doug,
you're up to your old tricks,

08:27.373 --> 08:30.041
and she falls for it
every time.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.010
Let's pause here
and write down these rules

08:32.010 --> 08:33.845
we've learned
from Beverly and Doug.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.514
Oh, I love
the smell in here.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.549
Reminds me of interning
on Wall Street,

08:38.551 --> 08:41.486
you know, minus the dignity
and the future.

08:41.486 --> 08:44.322
But why would the paper products
be near the toner cartridges?

08:44.323 --> 08:45.623
Whoever organized
this place

08:45.624 --> 08:47.625
must have been stupid
or lazy or both.

08:47.626 --> 08:49.694
Aboth.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.363
Forget
all that shelf stuff.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.331
You are not here
to improve office layout,

08:53.332 --> 08:55.333
you're here to keep quiet,
pretend like you're working,

08:55.334 --> 08:56.901
and steal
five to ten vitamin waters

08:56.902 --> 08:59.804
from the break room
at the end of each day.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.807
Hey.

09:02.808 --> 09:06.745
Are you watching dirty videos
in here and didn't invite me?

09:06.746 --> 09:09.981
They're making
harassment videos in 3-D now?

09:09.982 --> 09:11.649
I was looking
for the new temps,

09:11.650 --> 09:13.585
but I think I wandered
into a beauty pageant.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.254
Uh, the votes are in.
It's a tie.

09:16.755 --> 09:18.189
I'm Eli Green,
the office manager.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.257
You must be our new temps.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.525
I'm Caroline Channing.

09:20.526 --> 09:23.361
And I'm Carmen... Sandiego.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.263
No relation.

09:32.556 --> 09:34.290
Oh, my God,
this is great!

09:34.791 --> 09:36.692
The cat's
eating the dog's food.

09:36.693 --> 09:39.628
The dog's just like,
"Wha-a-at?"

09:39.629 --> 09:43.799
Yo, psst. "Cat eats dog food."
YouTube it now.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.734
Kinda busy with my work.

09:45.735 --> 09:47.569
It's called "Minimum Wage"

09:47.570 --> 09:50.806
'cause you're supposed to do
the minimum.

09:50.807 --> 09:53.008
Mmm. Coffee tastes
so much better

09:53.009 --> 09:55.144
when it's from today
and you haven't paid for it.

09:56.579 --> 09:59.414
The dog's just like, "Wha-a-at""

09:59.415 --> 10:01.016
classic.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.986
You like that video?
Look up "Cat vs. Toddler."

10:03.987 --> 10:07.356
You're welcome.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.325
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this a modeling agency?

10:10.326 --> 10:12.594
Did I get off
on the wrong floor?

10:12.595 --> 10:17.766
I don't care where you get off
as long as it's not here.

10:17.767 --> 10:21.069
Hi, Eli. So any idea
when they'll decide

10:21.070 --> 10:23.272
who's getting the junior
executive promotion, or--

10:23.273 --> 10:25.274
Not yet, but I did
just mention your name

10:25.275 --> 10:27.042
- to the big guys, Ryan.
- I'm Leon.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.545
Hey, Caroline.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.913
Hi. Question:
I already finished

10:30.914 --> 10:32.447
the first quarter
claim reports...

10:32.448 --> 10:35.751
Are you doping?
We need to stretch this out.

10:35.752 --> 10:37.519
And since I had time,
I took the liberty

10:37.520 --> 10:39.354
of reformatting
the expense template,

10:39.355 --> 10:41.190
so what would you like me
to do now, Eli?

10:41.191 --> 10:44.426
Say my name,
say my name.

10:44.927 --> 10:46.528
Hey, Caroline,
you're not just hot,

10:46.529 --> 10:49.364
you're on fire over there.
You should be throwing your hat

10:49.365 --> 10:50.699
in the ring
for that executive job.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.201
Really?

10:52.202 --> 10:56.338
And this girl's just like,
"Wha-a-at?"

11:00.042 --> 11:02.144
That temp place
is soul-sucking,

11:02.145 --> 11:05.047
and I didn't even know
I had a soul to suck.

11:05.048 --> 11:08.717
If that's a suicide note,
just add my name to the end.

11:08.718 --> 11:10.385
Come on,
it's not that bad,

11:10.386 --> 11:13.088
and I got four free
fresh coffee drinks,

11:13.089 --> 11:15.424
and one had
a caramel drizzle.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.059
Caramel drizzle?

11:17.060 --> 11:19.728
That's definitely my name
at my next temp job.

11:19.729 --> 11:21.763
I don't know
if this is such a temp job.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.265
I'm filling out
this application

11:23.266 --> 11:25.133
to apply for that
junior executive position.

11:25.134 --> 11:26.969
Oh, no, you're not.

11:26.970 --> 11:28.503
We're only going back
one more time

11:28.504 --> 11:29.771
to get enough Wite-Out

11:29.772 --> 11:32.841
to do the Kim Kardashian
white manicure.

11:32.842 --> 11:35.978
Max, you saw me there today.
I'm good at this,

11:35.979 --> 11:38.013
and it felt amazing
to be working somewhere

11:38.014 --> 11:40.449
where my skills are valued
and supported.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.951
Oh! Are you not feeling
supported here?

11:42.952 --> 11:47.356
I'm sorry,
I'm a boss, not a bra.

11:47.357 --> 11:49.491
Should I praise you more?
Really killing it

11:49.492 --> 11:52.761
with the leaning on the counter
doing nothing.

11:52.762 --> 11:56.865
Kudos, Caroline.
Huzzah.

11:56.866 --> 11:58.533
Hey,
where's my "huzzah"?

11:58.534 --> 12:00.435
I was standing around
doing nothing too.

12:00.436 --> 12:01.837
And don't forget
about me.

12:01.838 --> 12:05.040
I was sitting around
doing nothing.

12:05.041 --> 12:07.643
In Korea, you all would be
left on the curb

12:07.644 --> 12:09.645
and taken away
with the garbage.

12:09.646 --> 12:13.615
Is that how
you got to America, Han?

12:14.316 --> 12:16.652
Earl, Caroline's
being an idiot.

12:16.653 --> 12:21.056
Oh, are we doing this
in front of her now?

12:21.057 --> 12:22.858
Hey, would you still
apply for that job

12:22.859 --> 12:25.661
if I told you we sold out of
the cupcakes tonight?

12:25.662 --> 12:27.062
Last one.

12:27.063 --> 12:28.864
Oh, so what,
they're good one day

12:28.865 --> 12:30.299
and you want me
to take them back?

12:30.300 --> 12:32.968
Who am I,
Robert Pattinson?

12:32.969 --> 12:36.038
So you just cut lil' coconut
here out of your life?

12:36.039 --> 12:37.673
That's cold.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.409
Max, this job
offers medical benefits.

12:40.410 --> 12:43.145
There are doctors
who don't have medical benefits.

12:43.146 --> 12:45.647
And financial security.
Maybe I want to wake up

12:45.648 --> 12:47.816
every morning
not wanting to kill myself.

12:47.817 --> 12:50.819
Well, that's weird,
but whatever.

12:54.223 --> 12:56.758
I went to Wharton.

12:56.759 --> 12:58.260
Pay attention,
everyone.

12:58.261 --> 12:59.895
I know you're all
very busy working hard--

12:59.896 --> 13:01.763
<i>Congratulations,</i>

13:01.764 --> 13:03.899
- <i>you've just won a free iPad.</i>
- What the-I don't know--

13:04.900 --> 13:06.435
Attention, everyone!

13:06.436 --> 13:09.071
While doing work
and nothing but work,

13:09.072 --> 13:11.440
I may have downloaded
a virus that meows,

13:11.441 --> 13:14.376
so be on the lookout.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.111
Carry on, Eli.

13:16.112 --> 13:18.847
Thank you, Carmen.

13:18.848 --> 13:20.849
Happy to say,
tenth floor

13:20.850 --> 13:22.351
has finally picked
our new junior exec,

13:22.352 --> 13:23.952
and that person
is sitting right here.

13:23.953 --> 13:25.754
- Yes!
- No, Caroline.

13:25.755 --> 13:27.356
- Yes!
- No!

13:27.357 --> 13:28.357
Champagne on me!

13:28.358 --> 13:30.459
Yes!

13:37.003 --> 13:39.470
Here, I got us a fresh bottle,
'cause I'm the boss.

13:39.621 --> 13:41.455
Miss Black,
would you pop that cork for me?

13:41.456 --> 13:43.724
I'd be happy to,
Miss Channing, you bitch.

13:43.725 --> 13:46.260
Ooh!

13:46.761 --> 13:49.430
Okay.

13:49.431 --> 13:52.166
Okay, okay, now
I'm gonna make a proper toast.

13:52.167 --> 13:53.768
I don't know how.

13:53.769 --> 13:55.736
Their toaster oven's
in our kitchen.

13:55.737 --> 13:58.472
To Max--I promise
not to sexually harass you

13:58.473 --> 14:01.075
no matter how much I'm
required to as your superior.

14:01.076 --> 14:03.744
To Caroline--
I cannot promise the same thing,

14:03.745 --> 14:07.248
'cause sister, you fine.

14:07.249 --> 14:10.751
Oh, crap! I spilled champagne
on my good bucket blazer.

14:10.752 --> 14:14.922
Yes, right there
on your breasts, Beverly.

14:14.923 --> 14:17.258
I'm doing Doug from
the sexual harassment video.

14:17.259 --> 14:19.927
<i>The</i> Doug?
Love your harassment work!

14:20.428 --> 14:23.497
Especially that sad H.R. scene
where you get fired and cry

14:23.498 --> 14:26.601
but still manage
to touch yourself a little.

14:26.602 --> 14:28.803
Wow, Beverly,

14:28.804 --> 14:31.172
your breasts are so big,
I might need the whole box.

14:33.175 --> 14:36.210
That's enough. You're making
this rag feel even dirtier.

14:36.211 --> 14:37.812
- Hey, hand me that.
- What?

14:37.813 --> 14:39.947
- My new Westship Company poncho?
- Yep.

14:39.948 --> 14:42.550
Now it's my booze bib.

14:42.551 --> 14:44.452
Oh, I love this.

14:44.453 --> 14:47.221
Somehow it's small enough
to fit in your purse,

14:47.222 --> 14:48.789
but large enough
to sleep under

14:48.790 --> 14:50.491
during an
"Occupy Wall Street"-type situation.

14:52.394 --> 14:54.729
Max, I'm pouring you
more champagne

14:54.730 --> 14:55.997
because
I have something

14:55.998 --> 14:57.965
really exciting
I want to tell you.

14:57.966 --> 15:01.168
I talked to Eli
about hiring you full-time.

15:01.169 --> 15:04.171
You are now a junior executive's
executive assistant!

15:04.672 --> 15:08.709
I will knock you
to the ground!

15:08.990 --> 15:12.313
Max, think about it.
It comes with health care.

15:12.314 --> 15:14.682
You wouldn't have to decide
between birth control pills

15:14.683 --> 15:17.051
and morning-after pills.

15:17.052 --> 15:21.055
Are you trying to take away
a woman's right to choose?

15:22.056 --> 15:24.425
Come on,
it could be so fun.

15:24.426 --> 15:26.527
Coming to work together,
getting free coffee--

15:26.528 --> 15:28.829
the good kind,
the blended kind--

15:28.830 --> 15:31.499
not to mention
Xeroxing our asses

15:31.500 --> 15:33.167
and feeling more alive
than ever.

15:33.168 --> 15:35.036
Watch, I'll show you
what a fun boss I can be.

15:35.037 --> 15:38.039
Let's Xerox our asses.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.908
Well, how could I say no
to copying my butt?

15:40.909 --> 15:42.009
The only thing better
than one of my butts

15:42.010 --> 15:44.078
is two of my butts.

15:44.079 --> 15:47.348
- I'll go first.
- Too late!

15:47.349 --> 15:50.217
Do you want legal size paper
or three-hole punch?

15:50.218 --> 15:54.255
Three-hole punch? That's how
my longest relationship ended.

15:54.256 --> 15:57.959
Ready, you corporate sell-out.
Fry me.

16:01.363 --> 16:03.431
Hey,
why is it still flashing?

16:03.432 --> 16:06.567
Whoops! I put in 100 copies
instead of one.

16:06.568 --> 16:09.904
Don't worry about it, we'll
use them as Christmas cards.

16:09.905 --> 16:13.040
See? That's why
I need an assistant.

16:13.041 --> 16:16.110
Thanks, but I'm not gonna take
this stupid corporate job.

16:16.111 --> 16:19.246
I'm gonna stick with cupcakes,
even though you just quit.

16:19.947 --> 16:21.882
I didn't quit
the cupcake business.

16:21.883 --> 16:23.751
If you remember,
it quit us.

16:23.752 --> 16:25.119
At least
this job makes sense.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.455
You get a regular paycheck,
benefits.

16:27.456 --> 16:29.256
You don't spend
two whole years of your life

16:29.257 --> 16:30.658
giving it everything,

16:30.659 --> 16:32.259
and then walk away
feeling like a failure.

16:32.260 --> 16:33.995
Get off that now.
I'm worried

16:33.996 --> 16:35.329
you're giving yourself
butt cancer.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.500
Wait,
you think you're a failure?

16:39.501 --> 16:41.268
'Cause I think
we did amazing.

16:41.269 --> 16:44.572
The shop closed, Max.
Our dream blew up in our face.

16:44.573 --> 16:46.841
Lots of things
blow up in your face.

16:46.842 --> 16:50.511
It's part
of being a woman.

16:52.447 --> 16:56.951
You just...
Towel off and keep going.

16:56.952 --> 16:58.519
You're really
going to do this?

16:58.520 --> 17:00.521
This was just supposed to be
a temporary distraction

17:00.522 --> 17:02.156
till we got back
to the cupcake thing.

17:02.157 --> 17:04.625
No, Max.
Cupcakes were the temp job.

17:04.626 --> 17:06.594
No, cupcakes
were our dream.

17:06.595 --> 17:08.095
Well, I was wrong.

17:08.096 --> 17:11.766
Maybe it's better
not to have a dream.

17:13.335 --> 17:14.835
Good morning, everyone.

17:14.836 --> 17:16.637
Eli, they said
you wanted to see me in here?

17:16.637 --> 17:19.306
Ms. Channing, my name
is Michelle Yi, I'm with H.R.

17:19.307 --> 17:22.209
Aw! Is this
my official welcome?

17:22.210 --> 17:24.310
Oh, hello.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.780
Well, here, I brought

17:25.781 --> 17:27.515
some first-day bagels
and plain cream cheese.

17:27.516 --> 17:30.484
Sometimes chives can be
a little breathy, am I right?

17:30.485 --> 17:33.254
Is this the woman
who sexually harassed you?

17:34.790 --> 17:37.158
Yup, that's her.

17:37.159 --> 17:41.328
Oh, good one!
Really funny.

17:41.329 --> 17:42.696
Me harassing you?

17:42.697 --> 17:44.865
Come on,
you're not even my type.

17:44.866 --> 17:47.001
Caroline,
this isn't a joke.

17:47.002 --> 17:49.503
Trust me, I've been through
four of these.

17:49.504 --> 17:51.238
Wait,
what's going on?

17:51.239 --> 17:53.808
Ms. Channing, please
don't address Carmen directly.

17:53.809 --> 17:55.676
- Max.
- "Max"?

17:55.677 --> 17:58.145
Is that a pet name
she has for you, Carmen?

17:58.146 --> 18:03.918
Yes. She also calls me
"Caramel Drizzle."

18:03.919 --> 18:06.020
Can you tell me
what exactly happened

18:06.021 --> 18:07.655
with Ms. Channing
last night?

18:07.656 --> 18:10.257
She fondled my breasts.

18:10.258 --> 18:12.493
Ms. Yi,
it's not how it sounds.

18:12.494 --> 18:15.229
We were drinking, and I was
pretending to be a man.

18:15.230 --> 18:17.098
"Drinking."
"Pretending to be a man."

18:17.099 --> 18:19.366
Don't write that down.
Don't write that down.

18:19.367 --> 18:21.102
And Carmen,
when Ms. Channing touched you,

18:21.103 --> 18:22.503
how did that make you feel?

18:22.504 --> 18:24.405
Dirty.

18:24.406 --> 18:26.674
Dirty and underpaid.

18:26.675 --> 18:28.442
She felt dirty?

18:28.443 --> 18:30.244
Come on, Ms. Yi,
you don't know her.

18:30.245 --> 18:34.115
She's the dirty girl.
She is a dirty, dirty girl.

18:34.116 --> 18:36.217
And does that
turn you on?

18:36.218 --> 18:39.854
No! It's almost impossible
to turn me on.

18:39.855 --> 18:43.057
Oh, good.
Now I don't feel so bad.

18:43.058 --> 18:45.359
Trust me,
she's making this stuff up.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.894
I'm sorry, Ms. Channing.

18:46.895 --> 18:49.263
We're gonna have to terminate
your employment.

18:49.264 --> 18:53.367
This is outrageous!
Nothing she said ever happened.

18:53.368 --> 18:57.071
Then how do you
explain this?

18:57.072 --> 18:59.306
That is a copy
from a Xerox machine

18:59.307 --> 19:01.242
badly in need of toner,
which is just one

19:01.243 --> 19:03.444
of the many oversights
that would not have continued

19:03.445 --> 19:07.148
had I been made
an executive here. Good day.

19:09.651 --> 19:12.086
I don't know
what she's talking about.

19:12.087 --> 19:13.621
That butt
couldn't be any toner.

19:13.622 --> 19:15.890
Write that down,
write that down.

19:15.891 --> 19:18.826
Can I get a peek
at that?

19:25.167 --> 19:26.934
How are you tonight,
Caroline?

19:26.935 --> 19:29.170
Angry, frustrated,
humiliated.

19:29.171 --> 19:32.540
Just another Tuesday
at the diner.

19:33.541 --> 19:35.409
Hello, Carmen.
Or is it "Caramel Drizzle?"

19:35.410 --> 19:37.444
Just so you know,

19:37.445 --> 19:40.281
that stunt will go
on my professional work record.

19:40.282 --> 19:41.682
Oh, please.
This diner's

19:41.683 --> 19:44.084
on your professional
work record.

19:44.085 --> 19:47.121
And your record's clean.
Eli expunged it

19:47.122 --> 19:50.524
because I gave him
a couple of my ass Xeroxes.

19:50.525 --> 19:52.526
He's laminating them
and using them as place mats.

19:52.527 --> 19:54.228
My idea.

19:54.229 --> 19:57.097
For what, Max?
Why'd you get me fired?

19:57.098 --> 19:59.099
Why'd I get you fired?

19:59.100 --> 20:03.304
Well, let me give you
a "for instance."

20:03.305 --> 20:06.240
I once knew this girl
who was so used to not failing

20:06.241 --> 20:07.775
that the first time
she did,

20:07.776 --> 20:09.944
she got so scared,
she forgot who she was

20:09.945 --> 20:11.412
and tried to be
somebody else,

20:11.413 --> 20:14.215
and then she touched
my breastesses.

20:14.216 --> 20:16.150
Look, it's cool
if you don't

20:16.151 --> 20:17.718
want to join in
on the cupcake dream,

20:17.719 --> 20:19.753
but at least wait
till you find another.

20:19.754 --> 20:21.822
Don't hop on the first one
that comes along.

20:21.823 --> 20:24.391
It's a dream,
not a man.

20:24.392 --> 20:26.660
See?
You are a dirty girl.

20:26.661 --> 20:29.830
I'm a dirty, dirty girl.

20:30.231 --> 20:33.834
Hey, cupcake quitters.

20:33.835 --> 20:36.770
Look, do you see
what you've driven me to?

20:36.771 --> 20:39.173
Supermarket cakes.

20:40.174 --> 20:42.309
Sophie, you don't need
to eat those.

20:42.310 --> 20:43.811
You can have one of ours.

20:43.812 --> 20:47.481
Max's Homemade Cupcakes
is back in business.

20:49.651 --> 20:53.320
It would be cruel
to kid me.

20:53.821 --> 20:56.457
Nope. We're doing it
differently this time.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.259
We are? How?

20:58.260 --> 20:59.793
I have no idea.

20:59.794 --> 21:01.662
But for starters,

21:01.663 --> 21:04.298
you're my new junior executive
executive's assistant.

21:04.799 --> 21:08.936
I will knock you
to the ground.

21:08.937 --> 21:13.007
Mmm. Ohh. Yeah.

21:13.008 --> 21:15.776
Well, Mama happy now.

21:17.080 --> 21:23.980
