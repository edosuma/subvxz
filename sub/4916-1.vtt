00:23.897 --> 00:27.234
The battle between the Darkness
and the Light has waged eternal,

00:27.275 --> 00:30.570
their armies fueled by
souls harvested on Earth.

00:30.612 --> 00:34.517
The Lord of Darkness, Malebolgia,
has sent a lieutenant...

00:34.537 --> 00:37.786
to recruit men who will
help destroy the world...

00:37.828 --> 00:40.705
in exchange for wealth and power...

00:41.340 --> 00:44.543
and provide enough souls
to complete his army...

00:44.584 --> 00:48.131
and allow Armageddon to begin.

00:48.727 --> 00:52.926
All Malebolgia needs now
is a great soldier,

00:52.968 --> 00:56.633
someone to lead his hordes
to the gates of Heaven...

00:56.653 --> 00:58.390
and burn them down.

03:14.710 --> 03:17.946
Like him, I killed in the name of good,

03:18.611 --> 03:22.442
but the violence of my life, pulled
my soul towards the darkness.

03:23.093 --> 03:25.638
But I fought and freed my soul.

03:27.723 --> 03:31.256
Now I watch for others like me.

03:32.185 --> 03:35.044
Men are the ones who
create evil on Earth.

03:35.207 --> 03:38.723
It is the choices they make
that enslave their souls.

03:40.233 --> 03:43.257
This is the test.

06:03.519 --> 06:07.401
Josef as-Amifar, the leader of the
Algerian Revolutionary Front...

06:07.421 --> 06:10.642
was killed yesterday along
with 26 innocent civilians...

06:10.662 --> 06:13.552
in a vicious rocket attack
at an airport in Hong Kong.

06:13.813 --> 06:16.680
There has been an outpouring
of anti-U. S. sentiments...

06:16.700 --> 06:18.056
sweeping across the globe.

06:18.575 --> 06:19.884
Protesters in Libya,

06:19.904 --> 06:21.495
Bosnia, France, Moscow...

06:21.515 --> 06:22.465
and the United States...

06:22.485 --> 06:24.185
are joining together to denounce this....

06:24.347 --> 06:26.131
Simmons is the best.

06:26.398 --> 06:28.192
Simmons is not the problem!

06:28.352 --> 06:30.386
He's overseas killing the bad guys...

06:30.406 --> 06:32.834
Like the hero that he thinks he is.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.667
We made a deal, Wynn.

06:34.798 --> 06:37.538
Where the hell is the ultimate
weapon you promised us?

06:37.580 --> 06:39.512
This isn't a game we're playing.

06:40.040 --> 06:43.268
Engineering a biological
weapon is an exact science.

06:43.288 --> 06:45.805
You want it done right,
you do it my way.

06:45.825 --> 06:48.883
This five-year plan of yours
just chaps my buttocks.

06:48.924 --> 06:51.343
I'm making you a guarantee.

06:51.385 --> 06:54.718
All you have to do is keep
certain agencies off my back...

06:54.738 --> 06:57.152
and make damn sure I get all
that I've been promised.

06:57.172 --> 07:00.519
This is me you're taking to.
If I say you're the man, you're the man.

07:00.539 --> 07:03.814
You do for me, and in no time
you'll be running this place.

07:04.158 --> 07:07.276
And when the big piÙŒata
breaks, you'll get it all.

07:07.433 --> 07:10.070
Just make sure you keep
your end of the bargain.

07:12.414 --> 07:13.449
P.S...

07:13.776 --> 07:16.130
There's one more item
on our "to do" list.

07:16.150 --> 07:18.605
It requires your personal attention.

07:18.745 --> 07:21.832
We need you to help recruit a
very special soldier for us.

07:21.874 --> 07:25.065
Your all-time favorite
killer, Al Simmons.

07:25.628 --> 07:29.229
Simmons? He's doing a
great job where he is.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.488
Why do you want him?

07:30.508 --> 07:33.052
Why do you people always question?

07:33.072 --> 07:37.284
Why ask "Why", when "How"
is so much more fun?

07:47.936 --> 07:50.086
Oh... not again.

07:52.521 --> 07:54.314
- Hey, Wanda, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

07:54.356 --> 07:55.691
Buy your man a watch.

07:55.733 --> 07:57.990
He's on his way out.
Do me a favor.

07:58.010 --> 07:58.902
What's that?

07:58.944 --> 08:00.704
Make sure he's back for
dinner tomorrow night.

08:00.724 --> 08:01.662
I'll do my best.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.199
Make sure he's back for
dinner, tomorrow night, Terry.

08:04.241 --> 08:05.242
Yes, ma'am.

08:17.755 --> 08:19.089
Hey, Spaz.

08:19.516 --> 08:21.216
Same routine, all right?

08:21.258 --> 08:23.019
Guard the house.
Guard Wanda.

08:24.219 --> 08:25.637
Great guard dog.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.058
Here.

08:37.441 --> 08:39.556
Hey, Al, what happened last night?

08:39.576 --> 08:40.731
Look at this.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.780
What a friggin' mess.

08:42.821 --> 08:44.615
We were supposed to be
taking out the bad guys,

08:44.656 --> 08:46.075
not innocent bystanders.

08:46.453 --> 08:48.160
Another Jason Wynn special.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.135
What do you mean?

08:50.155 --> 08:53.244
Seems like an awful lot of Wynn's
ops have screwed the pooch lately.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.752
Don't worry, Al. Lighten up.
I got your back.

08:58.921 --> 09:00.947
Semper Fi.
Good to go.

09:02.687 --> 09:03.814
All right.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.859
I'm gonna keep my eye on Wynn.

09:25.989 --> 09:27.533
Vehicle secure.

09:36.667 --> 09:40.278
The airport kill zone was supposed
to be clear of civilians.

09:40.629 --> 09:43.632
An unfortunate, but
necessary sacrifice.

09:43.918 --> 09:47.177
You want someone filling
body bags, you send Priest.

09:47.693 --> 09:49.680
If you can't handle it, I will.

09:52.182 --> 09:55.533
I will send whoever,
wherever I choose.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.480
You will follow orders,
and do your job.

09:58.522 --> 10:00.023
Got a problem with that, soldier?

10:00.408 --> 10:02.164
Yes, I do, sir...

10:03.666 --> 10:04.695
and I want out.

10:05.988 --> 10:08.071
I always knew you'd lose your nerve.

10:09.324 --> 10:11.368
You don't quit us, son.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.829
We are not the U.S. Postal Service.

10:17.532 --> 10:19.793
Have you read your profile recently?

10:19.835 --> 10:22.111
You are a borderline psychopath,

10:22.346 --> 10:24.214
perfect for government service.

10:24.710 --> 10:29.053
No guilt, no fear!
You're a killing machine.

10:30.012 --> 10:32.306
- You're wrong about me, Wynn.
- Am I?

10:33.557 --> 10:37.166
Have you ever stopped to consider that
you won't be happy doing anything else?

10:37.186 --> 10:38.979
I made up my mind.

10:39.021 --> 10:41.098
Nothing I can say to
make you change it?

10:41.699 --> 10:42.680
Nothing.

10:44.095 --> 10:45.175
All right.

10:45.694 --> 10:47.212
I'll arrange for your transfer...

10:47.232 --> 10:49.579
right after we've run
this last operation.

10:50.281 --> 10:53.744
North Korean refinery secretly
producing biological weapons.

10:54.953 --> 10:57.159
It's up to us to take out the plant...

10:57.289 --> 11:00.918
and carefully destroy all
the biochemical viruses.

11:03.393 --> 11:05.422
Come on, son.
This is top priority.

11:09.885 --> 11:11.345
Let's get it over with.

12:26.762 --> 12:28.764
What the hell is going on here?

12:29.184 --> 12:29.991
Wynn!

12:30.104 --> 12:32.142
Priorities have changed, Al.

12:32.298 --> 12:34.629
There's a town less than
a mile away from here.

12:34.798 --> 12:37.303
If you release the virus,
they'll all die.

12:37.323 --> 12:41.768
A town with approximately
8,000 experimental hosts.

12:41.908 --> 12:44.029
Are you out of your damn mind?

12:44.071 --> 12:45.865
I'm not gonna let you do this.

12:53.543 --> 12:55.541
Looks like I'm up for a promotion.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.570
You wipe his ass, too?

13:01.957 --> 13:03.788
You son of a bitch.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.200
You knew what was going on all along.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.387
I do believe he's catching on.

13:12.902 --> 13:15.154
Enjoy your retirement, old friend.

13:15.196 --> 13:18.278
Oh, and by the way, don't
worry about Wanda.

13:19.349 --> 13:21.104
I'll take good care of her.

13:22.424 --> 13:25.344
You touch her, and you're a dead man.

13:26.784 --> 13:28.409
You're the dead man.

13:36.070 --> 13:37.675
See you later, Al.

14:00.780 --> 14:04.451
Wanda!

14:28.943 --> 14:32.308
Aw, look who was left
in the oven too long.

14:34.157 --> 14:36.159
I told him well-done, not burnt.

14:36.969 --> 14:38.828
Their gonna have fun with you.

14:41.289 --> 14:41.974
Boo!

16:08.710 --> 16:10.878
Hey, mister, you don't look so good.

16:11.863 --> 16:13.459
Hey, mister, you thirsty?

16:14.877 --> 16:16.248
Hey, mister, you thirsty?

16:17.873 --> 16:18.830
Get the...

16:19.985 --> 16:21.488
Get lost, kid.

16:25.632 --> 16:27.687
What are you looking at, old man?

16:29.735 --> 16:31.040
You tell me.

16:33.736 --> 16:35.868
You've been gone a long time, friend.

16:36.237 --> 16:37.947
What are you talking about?

16:37.989 --> 16:39.365
Where am I?

16:39.407 --> 16:41.390
Rat city.
Part of the alley.

16:41.673 --> 16:42.903
I sleep over there.

16:43.870 --> 16:47.624
This is a holy place.
All are welcome here.

16:47.665 --> 16:49.000
Here, Zack, here.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.836
Yeah, right.

16:54.345 --> 16:58.458
I've seen worse faces, mister.
My dad used to work for a mortician.

16:59.810 --> 17:03.979
Thanks, kid.
I feel much better now.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.691
Don't loiter!
Let's go! Let's go!

17:57.074 --> 18:01.093
You're welcome to join us...
if you choose.

18:06.134 --> 18:07.580
I got a home.

18:20.484 --> 18:23.407
A new spawn has emerged
from the darkness.

18:24.546 --> 18:26.226
Reborn on Earth...

18:27.058 --> 18:29.818
drawn to the alley by
an unknown force...

18:29.838 --> 18:32.681
his necroplasmic body
wracked by pain...

18:32.701 --> 18:34.611
his memories fragmented.

18:34.846 --> 18:37.766
To him, North Korea was moments ago.

18:37.926 --> 18:42.381
But Malebolgia kept him secluded
in darkness five long years...

18:42.620 --> 18:45.755
while things on Earth
changed in ways...

18:45.775 --> 18:49.044
that will only feed his anger
and desire for revenge.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.848
He sets out to reclaim his humanity.

18:54.693 --> 18:58.233
How much is left remains to be seen.

19:19.797 --> 19:21.252
One...

19:21.272 --> 19:22.745
two...

19:22.765 --> 19:24.896
three!

19:31.307 --> 19:32.724
Wanda!

19:36.399 --> 19:38.192
I don't have a choice.

19:38.234 --> 19:40.653
I'll always love you...

19:41.100 --> 19:42.377
forever.

19:44.423 --> 19:45.982
- How's this doing?
- I don't know...

19:46.002 --> 19:48.297
I'm gonna get the troops
some more lemonade, OK?

19:52.855 --> 19:54.023
I'll take some.

20:09.903 --> 20:11.189
Spaz.

20:13.905 --> 20:15.961
They say it's a trick, but it's snot.

20:16.787 --> 20:18.825
Ah!
I'm amazing, aren't I?!

20:19.228 --> 20:21.097
Hey, little girl, where you going?

20:24.980 --> 20:26.904
Want some candy?

20:30.615 --> 20:31.826
Cyan!

20:33.289 --> 20:36.684
You OK, baby? Huh, huh?
Terry! Terry!

20:36.704 --> 20:38.454
I like children... fried.

20:39.737 --> 20:40.528
Terry!

20:41.672 --> 20:42.855
Wanda...

20:44.113 --> 20:45.127
What's going on?

20:45.147 --> 20:47.219
I came out here and this man
was lying next to Cyan.

20:47.822 --> 20:49.327
- Are you OK, honey?
- Uh huh.

20:49.559 --> 20:51.349
What are you doing back here, huh?

20:52.383 --> 20:53.409
What is it?

20:54.832 --> 20:57.245
Beat it, 'fore I call the cops, huh.
Come on, get outta here.

20:57.265 --> 21:00.255
Oh, there you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

21:01.359 --> 21:03.945
Bad Crispy! Bad Crispy!

21:03.986 --> 21:05.637
Clown not like.

21:06.497 --> 21:08.149
Sorry for the turbulence, folks.

21:08.169 --> 21:09.833
He's harmless.
He's safe as milk.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.833
Just a freak accident
with some Jiffy Pop.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.477
All right, that's it. Just get your stuff,
get out of here and take him with you.

21:14.497 --> 21:17.616
Oh, what an adorable little girl.

21:17.636 --> 21:19.543
Oh, look at her...
Can I keep her?

21:19.585 --> 21:20.444
Hey.

21:20.464 --> 21:23.124
Oh, of course not.
No pets allowed.

21:23.798 --> 21:26.401
A little something for lovely here?

21:26.608 --> 21:28.012
Baby exorcist.

21:29.138 --> 21:31.777
All right!
Come on, my barbecued friend.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.136
Don't want to keep that side order
of potato salad waiting, now do we?

21:40.418 --> 21:41.310
Terry...

21:42.708 --> 21:44.764
- He knew my name.
- Are you sure?

21:47.280 --> 21:49.740
Come on.
Let's get the kids inside.

21:56.372 --> 21:57.540
You can't get married.

21:57.582 --> 22:00.018
Wanda's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

22:00.038 --> 22:01.502
I'm there for you, buddy.

22:01.544 --> 22:03.421
This is my last mission.

22:03.462 --> 22:04.630
Wait for me.

22:04.672 --> 22:06.215
I just don't want to lose you, baby.

22:06.257 --> 22:09.462
You will never lose me.
I promise.

22:13.535 --> 22:16.539
Oh, yes we are...
Master and I are going to have words.

22:16.559 --> 22:19.020
He knows I hate clowns.
God, I hate 'em.

22:19.061 --> 22:20.141
I hate 'em all.

22:20.161 --> 22:22.189
I hate Bozo, Ronald, Chuckles...

22:22.231 --> 22:26.360
with their freakin' dumb noses
and their lousy party hats!

22:29.470 --> 22:31.449
I don't mind being
short, fat, and ugly,

22:31.490 --> 22:32.869
but the pay sucks!

22:37.888 --> 22:39.312
What? Hey!

22:39.597 --> 22:41.128
Easy with that face.
I'm eating.

22:42.354 --> 22:44.412
Oops. A wet one.

22:44.825 --> 22:47.379
I hope I didn't stain my underwear.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.654
Look at that.
Skid marks.

22:50.674 --> 22:52.807
Get away from me, you freak.

22:53.474 --> 22:56.868
Oh, coming from a monster,
that really hurts my feelings.

22:56.910 --> 22:59.121
Hey, come back here, bacon face.

22:59.438 --> 23:01.091
I'm not done with you yet.

23:01.777 --> 23:04.556
Feels like my skin
is about to explode.

23:05.050 --> 23:09.214
That's your viral necroplasm
going through its larval stage.

23:09.942 --> 23:10.966
Move over.

23:11.895 --> 23:13.969
Pretty soon you're gonna
get hair in funny places,

23:13.989 --> 23:15.887
and you're gonna start
thinking about girls.

23:17.305 --> 23:19.305
Tell me about it.
Talk to me.

23:20.348 --> 23:22.630
Just get me to a hospital.

23:22.733 --> 23:24.020
A hospital?

23:25.150 --> 23:27.938
Have you looked in a mirror,
lately, burnt man walking?

23:28.540 --> 23:32.033
Even the entire cast of "ER"
couldn't put you back together again.

23:32.293 --> 23:33.920
How do I put this to you?

23:34.016 --> 23:35.547
You're, ah, pushing up daisies.

23:35.567 --> 23:37.406
You're in permanent nap time.

23:37.566 --> 23:40.483
You're fertilizer.
Hey, is any of this sinking in?

23:40.652 --> 23:41.713
You're dead.

23:41.733 --> 23:44.504
D-e-d. Dead.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.577
I guess five years
feeding earthworms...

23:47.597 --> 23:49.990
has eaten what little
brain there was in there.

23:52.771 --> 23:55.065
What are you?

23:57.269 --> 24:00.255
Well, allow me to
kick-start your memory.

24:00.275 --> 24:03.198
Hang on.
These flashbacks can be killers.

24:04.092 --> 24:05.492
You're the dead man.

24:27.833 --> 24:31.044
This is the bargain.

24:31.086 --> 24:36.299
If you lead my army, you
can see Wanda again.

24:39.578 --> 24:42.226
What is your answer?

24:42.502 --> 24:43.507
Yes!..

24:43.713 --> 24:46.248
Yes, I will lead your army!

24:46.268 --> 24:47.602
Anything for Wanda!

24:50.407 --> 24:55.110
If you fail me, you will die!

24:55.944 --> 25:01.283
Avenge your murder!
Kill Jason Wynn!

25:03.462 --> 25:06.570
Foul Malebolgia spent five
years preparing the Earth...

25:06.590 --> 25:08.251
for your arrival, mister.

25:08.271 --> 25:10.429
A little death,
a little destruction...

25:10.449 --> 25:12.024
perfect marriage.

25:12.756 --> 25:14.324
Speaking of marriage...

25:14.344 --> 25:16.590
guess who's not your wifeola anymore?

25:17.799 --> 25:20.594
And the winners are: Wanda and Terry.

25:20.635 --> 25:22.776
Multiplying like rabbits.

25:22.907 --> 25:24.953
And jumpin' and pumpin'...

25:24.973 --> 25:26.646
and doin' it and...

25:26.666 --> 25:29.313
You stay away from her.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.561
I don't want Wanda.

25:30.581 --> 25:32.643
I want you to take care of Wynn.

25:32.663 --> 25:35.986
And then you and the army can
kick some angelic buttocks.

25:36.891 --> 25:38.844
And in return for your services,

25:38.966 --> 25:40.478
we'll get Wanda back for you.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.544
Heck, you could have every
Wanda on the planet.

25:42.564 --> 25:44.580
Why settle for leftovers, huh?

25:46.203 --> 25:48.785
I like this guy.
Oh, you kill me!

25:48.805 --> 25:51.282
Go ahead, stud.

25:51.988 --> 25:54.659
This is all some
sadistic game of Wynn's.

25:55.462 --> 25:57.071
And when I catch him...

25:57.216 --> 25:59.628
he's gonna wish he had killed
me when he had the chance.

25:59.648 --> 26:01.766
That's it!
That's the spirit.

26:01.786 --> 26:04.175
Just think of me as
your guardian angel.

26:04.335 --> 26:05.997
The clown from Hell.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.455
You're Jimmy Stewart,
and I'm Clarence.

26:08.558 --> 26:11.694
"Uh, well, well, every
time somebody farts,

26:11.714 --> 26:13.854
"a demon gets his wings, ah..."

26:14.587 --> 26:15.919
Oops, twins.

26:16.531 --> 26:19.789
Get away from me, you
foul-smelling maggot!

26:19.809 --> 26:22.174
Well, you still don't get
it, do you, Amnesia Boy?

26:22.418 --> 26:24.449
We're gonna have to
dig a little deeper.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.234
What is this?

26:32.735 --> 26:36.092
This is where old folks
go after Florida, son.

26:36.251 --> 26:37.829
What is that you say?

26:37.849 --> 26:39.908
Can I dig up my body now?

26:40.223 --> 26:42.897
Why, certainly.
Of course you can.

26:42.917 --> 26:45.433
If you strike oil, half of it is mine.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.000
Start digging.

26:49.282 --> 26:56.805
I command the forces of darkness
to bestow their powers unto me!

27:01.436 --> 27:03.820
Told you we needed to
watch the Exorcist.

27:04.112 --> 27:07.282
Hey, how 'bout we get back
to that sacri-fighting idea?

27:07.612 --> 27:09.038
You know what I need here, man?

27:09.058 --> 27:10.824
A fresh skull, man!

27:11.873 --> 27:13.160
Yeah, you.
A fresh skull...

27:13.201 --> 27:14.916
- Get away!
- A fresh skull!

27:55.549 --> 27:57.537
A little bit more dead inside.

27:59.839 --> 28:04.562
Noooooo!....

28:04.582 --> 28:06.932
Oh, come on.
You scream like a girl.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.246
Do it like this.

28:12.383 --> 28:15.108
Someone's a little angry 'cause
they died and went to...

28:15.149 --> 28:17.697
Hello, my mutant, hello, my carcass,

28:17.800 --> 28:20.110
hello, my bug-infested corpse.

28:20.241 --> 28:22.457
Did, like, Satan send you guys?

28:23.530 --> 28:25.707
How come God hogs up all
the good followers,

28:25.727 --> 28:26.911
and we get all the retards?

28:26.931 --> 28:28.602
Hey, what's up with that face?

28:28.622 --> 28:30.367
Get your hands off me!

28:42.292 --> 28:43.303
Help.

28:46.272 --> 28:47.437
What is that?

28:57.519 --> 29:00.186
Look, it's so big.
That thing...

29:01.226 --> 29:04.507
Shocked and amazed at the
wonders of necroflesh?

29:05.695 --> 29:06.773
You're not alone.

29:06.815 --> 29:07.864
For a limited time only,

29:07.884 --> 29:10.427
you, too, can have this
handsome epidermis...

29:10.447 --> 29:14.490
for the eensy price of your
soul and a butt load of pain.

29:14.510 --> 29:17.325
- Let's get out of here!
- Oh, my God!

29:17.813 --> 29:20.370
I hate weekend Satanists, don't you?

29:20.953 --> 29:23.592
Look at you.
Look at you...

29:23.901 --> 29:28.545
From spawn larva to full-fledged
Hellspawn in record time.

29:29.794 --> 29:32.301
What... is this?

29:32.321 --> 29:35.096
Oh, boy, you were tied to the tracks,

29:35.116 --> 29:38.776
and that stupid train just kept
running over you, now, didn't it?

29:38.796 --> 29:40.098
Running over you.

29:41.269 --> 29:44.151
Name of the people and things of Hell,

29:44.171 --> 29:45.588
I dub thee...

29:46.396 --> 29:49.803
Spawn!
General of Hell's armies!

29:49.823 --> 29:51.860
Arise, Your Crispness!

29:52.148 --> 29:54.796
Arise, Duke of Deep-Fried!

29:55.030 --> 29:56.302
Sultan of Sizzling!

29:56.556 --> 29:58.838
Emir of Ooey-Gooey!

29:59.110 --> 30:01.692
All right, so I suck as a clown.
Bite me.

30:01.899 --> 30:06.117
Now look, do your job, and I'll be
the first to kiss your black butt,

30:06.268 --> 30:07.901
but if you can't hack it,

30:08.293 --> 30:10.589
I'll gladly FedEx your
worthless carcass...

30:10.609 --> 30:11.745
back to the frying pan,

30:11.765 --> 30:14.214
where Malebolgia will be
waiting for both of us.

30:17.614 --> 30:19.659
You'll wake up the dead.
Ooh, that's you.

30:20.206 --> 30:22.610
You know, dead people
can still die, Shreky.

30:22.729 --> 30:24.767
All I got to do is cut off your head.

30:25.727 --> 30:27.011
Oh, God.

30:28.053 --> 30:31.119
Did you have to use the "G" word?
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...

30:31.232 --> 30:32.471
Wanda...

30:33.943 --> 30:35.564
What have I done?

30:42.516 --> 30:44.601
You done with this Hallmark moment?

30:44.704 --> 30:47.862
Cos I can't take any more of
this sentimental crap. Come on.

30:50.293 --> 30:52.504
I'll come back when
your armor hardens.

30:52.545 --> 30:54.798
Don't play with it.
You'll go blind.

30:55.548 --> 30:57.959
I have a few more
details to attend to,

30:57.979 --> 30:59.844
and then we can play.

31:05.563 --> 31:06.605
Yuck!

31:07.159 --> 31:08.446
I hate anchovies.

31:20.569 --> 31:23.865
Um, I tastes so good, I
could kick some puppies!

31:25.198 --> 31:25.949
Good!

31:40.197 --> 31:42.064
This freak stuff's
gonna come in handy...

31:42.084 --> 31:43.830
when I get my hands on Wynn.

31:44.478 --> 31:46.450
You're letting them get to you.

31:47.751 --> 31:48.924
Easy, friend.

31:49.093 --> 31:51.408
Every choice has its consequences.

31:53.116 --> 31:54.421
Who are you?

31:57.201 --> 31:59.764
An assassin... like you.

32:00.506 --> 32:03.742
Only, I killed for the Kingdom
of Saxony, 500 years ago.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.099
I am Cogliostro.

32:06.537 --> 32:09.289
That's all you need to know...
for now.

32:09.738 --> 32:12.386
Are there any normal
people left on Earth?

32:12.987 --> 32:15.974
Or is everyone just back from Hell?

32:54.080 --> 32:55.958
How do you address the
accusations from some...

32:55.978 --> 32:58.526
quarters that the CIA
only acts to protect...

32:58.546 --> 33:00.261
protect the government's
economic interests...

33:00.281 --> 33:01.488
in the regions of conflict?

33:01.831 --> 33:03.933
I think the government
has been as attentive...

33:03.953 --> 33:06.638
to the sensitivities of the
nations involved, as possible.

33:07.051 --> 33:10.289
Since the unfortunate incident
in Southeast Asia last week,

33:10.309 --> 33:12.933
Director Wynn has been meeting
with several world leaders...

33:13.064 --> 33:14.647
in an attempt to quell
the proliferation...

33:14.667 --> 33:15.795
of global conflicts.

33:15.815 --> 33:17.983
And has this produced
any positive results?

33:18.003 --> 33:21.289
I heard that last week's peace summit
between the Arabs and Israelis was...

33:22.155 --> 33:24.415
Fitzgerald may be a
spineless bureaucrat,

33:24.435 --> 33:26.670
but he's doing a great P.R. job for me.

33:26.690 --> 33:28.735
Whole world is going to
Hell in a hand basket.

33:28.755 --> 33:32.195
But, thanks to him, he's just
another story on the 5:00 news.

33:32.561 --> 33:34.543
Like lambs to the slaughter.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.815
The best is yet to come.

33:42.334 --> 33:43.546
There it is, Jess.

33:44.212 --> 33:45.358
Finally ready.

33:45.808 --> 33:47.010
HEAT-16.

33:47.711 --> 33:50.350
Makes the Ebola virus
look like a skin rash.

33:51.467 --> 33:54.414
That North Korean biochemical
operation really paid off.

33:54.818 --> 33:58.275
We have harvested the ultimate
weapon from those diseased bodies,

33:58.527 --> 34:00.611
now we have the only vaccine.

34:02.794 --> 34:04.897
- Was there ever any doubt?
- Never.

34:05.156 --> 34:07.933
Now we have weapons in place
to disperse HEAT-16...

34:07.953 --> 34:10.684
over half of this godforsaken globe.

34:11.023 --> 34:13.520
Soon the whole world
will be at my command.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.659
Anyone who refuses to
join my consorte...

34:15.679 --> 34:17.333
he won't be around to argue.

34:53.255 --> 34:55.341
Time to get reacquainted, Jason.

34:56.342 --> 34:59.033
Director Wynn, Terry
Fitzgerald is here.

34:59.380 --> 35:00.480
Send him in.

35:01.890 --> 35:04.642
Speak of the devil. Come in, Terry.
Good to see you.

35:04.888 --> 35:06.699
- Director, the car is waiting downstairs.
- Good.

35:06.719 --> 35:08.990
- You know Agent Priest.
- Yes.

35:09.010 --> 35:11.065
Could I have a word with you...
alone?

35:11.107 --> 35:13.133
Of course.
Would you excuse us, my dear?

35:16.797 --> 35:18.281
Glad you dropped by, son.

35:18.323 --> 35:21.097
I been meaning to commend you on
the way you've handled the media.

35:21.117 --> 35:23.300
Those rumors about me were
becoming a real headache.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.217
- Let's have a drink.
- Thank you.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.730
I know we've been
covering up problems...

35:28.750 --> 35:30.645
with our missions overseas.

35:31.304 --> 35:33.505
I really can't keep
lying like this, sir.

35:33.629 --> 35:36.216
Lying? Really?

35:37.037 --> 35:38.551
I'd like to put a team together,

35:38.593 --> 35:41.509
analyze the field op data,
get to the bottom of it.

35:41.529 --> 35:43.834
But you're not an
analyst anymore, Terry.

35:43.854 --> 35:46.372
Well, there's no reason
not to take a look, sir.

35:46.392 --> 35:49.136
- On the contrary.
- Beg your pardon?

35:49.789 --> 35:54.400
Tell me...
how are Cyan and Wanda?

35:55.913 --> 35:58.238
Little girl just had a
birthday, didn't she?

35:58.776 --> 35:59.978
They're both fine.

35:59.998 --> 36:01.405
I'm glad to hear that.

36:01.699 --> 36:03.555
Now, let's get something straight.

36:04.147 --> 36:06.579
I run this organization
the way I see fit,

36:06.758 --> 36:10.100
and I will do whatever is
necessary to keep it that way.

36:10.120 --> 36:13.586
Your job is to make damn sure
the public agrees with me.

36:13.628 --> 36:14.908
That clear enough?

36:15.334 --> 36:17.090
- Yes
- Good.

36:24.810 --> 36:26.474
The car is waiting.

37:16.816 --> 37:18.651
Achmed and Abdullah.

37:18.693 --> 37:20.102
Achmed, my friend.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.382
Abdullah, good to see you.

37:23.368 --> 37:24.199
Up.

37:28.803 --> 37:29.873
This one here.

37:30.155 --> 37:31.695
- Excuse us.
- No...but...

37:49.935 --> 37:51.976
Excuse me, sir.
Urgent call.

37:52.536 --> 37:53.503
Gentlemen...

37:54.270 --> 37:55.522
Have you made a decision?

37:55.563 --> 37:57.807
Your HEAT-16 test was very impressive.

37:57.827 --> 38:00.735
Tell, me, how do you control
delivery of the weapon?

38:00.777 --> 38:02.987
The latest in nanotechnology.

38:03.029 --> 38:06.241
Let me assure you, gentlemen,
the weapon is problem-free.

38:06.261 --> 38:09.015
We've already placed orders
with several of our allies.

38:09.761 --> 38:12.872
You're becoming quite a
powerful man, Mr Wynn.

38:12.914 --> 38:15.790
Your consortium will soon
rival the United Nations.

38:15.810 --> 38:16.793
Not at all, sir.

38:16.835 --> 38:19.045
I'm just a facilitator.
Thank you.

38:19.227 --> 38:21.302
My partners are the beneficiaries.

38:21.798 --> 38:23.508
To my partners, gentlemen.

38:26.307 --> 38:28.334
- Fitzgerald.
- Code red security breach, sir.

38:28.354 --> 38:29.536
- Where?
- At the armory.

38:29.556 --> 38:30.804
A detail's en-route.

38:30.824 --> 38:33.115
I'm on my way.
Damn it.

38:34.436 --> 38:36.072
Agent Priest has arrived.

38:47.349 --> 38:48.491
Wait here.

38:49.064 --> 38:51.391
There's been a break-in
at A-6, the armory.

38:51.683 --> 38:53.054
- Who?
- We don't know.

38:53.074 --> 38:55.039
There's a security detail
downstairs with Priest.

38:55.151 --> 38:56.587
Let's get out of here.

39:13.099 --> 39:14.720
You!

39:18.625 --> 39:19.780
Who are you?

39:21.149 --> 39:22.992
What's the matter, Jason?

39:23.359 --> 39:25.585
You don't recognize
your own handiwork?

39:27.096 --> 39:30.880
You left me to die in that
bio-chem plant, remember?

39:31.566 --> 39:32.561
Simmons!

39:34.337 --> 39:36.247
You sent me to Hell, Jason!

39:36.712 --> 39:38.787
I'm here to return the favor!

39:45.122 --> 39:46.623
I trusted you.

39:47.074 --> 39:49.474
- Jesus.
- How could you marry Wanda?

39:49.656 --> 39:51.027
How could you?

39:51.469 --> 39:54.465
Al, when you died...

39:55.548 --> 39:57.384
Wanda was devastated.

39:59.071 --> 40:00.743
Do you know about Cyan?

40:05.453 --> 40:07.321
Time to die, Jason.

40:13.233 --> 40:15.454
Nice outfit, asshole.

40:31.632 --> 40:33.133
Damn.

40:35.552 --> 40:36.971
What the hell is that?

40:37.345 --> 40:38.697
It's Simmons!

40:38.895 --> 40:40.349
What are you talking about?

40:40.391 --> 40:42.014
That thing is Simmons!

40:42.034 --> 40:43.978
I want you to nail him, now!

41:25.193 --> 41:28.446
It's a little early for
Halloween, Simmons.

41:28.488 --> 41:31.903
Where you're going,
every day's Halloween.

41:35.754 --> 41:37.905
You don't have the guts.

41:44.833 --> 41:45.983
You're right.

41:46.184 --> 41:47.554
Coming, coming.

41:47.574 --> 41:50.222
Will that be the same or
separate checks, lady?

41:51.752 --> 41:54.493
Just when I was getting sick
of you whining about Wanda,

41:54.513 --> 41:56.025
you do us proud.

41:56.176 --> 41:58.348
So congrats on your first mission.

41:58.608 --> 41:59.926
Go ahead, inspect 'em.

42:35.414 --> 42:36.522
Hell yeah!

42:48.694 --> 42:50.567
Shoot on sight.

42:50.667 --> 42:53.006
I say again- shoot on sight.

42:53.047 --> 42:54.497
Get a light on him!

42:56.884 --> 42:57.844
There!

43:18.897 --> 43:20.632
- You see him?
- No, sir!

43:23.201 --> 43:24.852
Where the hell'd he go?

43:30.334 --> 43:31.658
Negative, sir!

43:42.055 --> 43:44.555
- There he is!
- All right! Take him!

44:29.811 --> 44:31.474
All right, what have
we got here, fellas?

44:31.494 --> 44:33.203
Gunshot wound to the head, Doc.

44:33.710 --> 44:35.149
Ah, she's dead.

44:35.250 --> 44:36.827
- Come on.
- All right.

44:36.977 --> 44:37.963
Let's go!

44:39.432 --> 44:40.447
Easy.

44:41.442 --> 44:42.493
Yup...there.

44:43.245 --> 44:44.297
That's it!

44:45.653 --> 44:47.663
Yeah, make some room here.
Make some room!

44:50.551 --> 44:52.955
- Put her around the back.
- Keep her on back.

45:00.135 --> 45:02.295
Why didn't you warn me about Simmons?

45:02.315 --> 45:04.608
Spawn was ready sooner
than I expected,

45:04.628 --> 45:06.821
so don't get your panties in a wad.

45:06.981 --> 45:08.417
Always bitching at me...

45:08.437 --> 45:09.976
"Why didn't you tell
me about Simmons?"

45:10.018 --> 45:11.603
"Why didn't you tell me
it was going to hurt?"

45:11.644 --> 45:12.943
"Am I going to go to Hell?"

45:13.056 --> 45:15.356
Oh, grow up, you sniveling ninny.

45:15.398 --> 45:17.317
At least you had fun compared to them.

45:17.496 --> 45:18.302
Fun?

45:18.322 --> 45:21.299
- Does this look like Playland to you?
- No.

45:21.319 --> 45:23.822
No, he killed Jessica!
He damn near killed me!

45:23.842 --> 45:25.993
You say that like it's a bad thing.

45:27.011 --> 45:30.663
No, Jerky.
Jerky, Spawn's a big idiot.

45:30.705 --> 45:32.498
Look, he's been through Hell.

45:34.872 --> 45:37.342
As soon as he finishes
one more little detail,

45:37.586 --> 45:39.267
he'll be ready to join us.

45:39.492 --> 45:41.128
Now, I've done my part.

45:41.362 --> 45:43.728
How about yours?
How we doing on your front?

45:45.937 --> 45:47.918
HEAT-16 is ready to go.

45:48.200 --> 45:51.026
It better be, bozo.
It better be.

45:51.311 --> 45:52.635
The armies ready.

45:52.937 --> 45:54.525
The Spawn's ready.

45:54.567 --> 45:56.484
The HEAT-16 completes the picture.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.196
Congrat-a-freak-a-lations.

45:58.216 --> 46:00.213
What's Simmons got
to do with all this?

46:00.233 --> 46:03.798
Oh, he's just the highest-scoring
killer of all time, that's all.

46:03.818 --> 46:06.597
If we hadn't recruited him, the
other side would have, musclehead.

46:06.857 --> 46:09.567
Odjiguy, almost forgot again.

46:09.857 --> 46:12.017
Memo from Brimstone Breath...

46:12.505 --> 46:15.012
we're gonna rig a
fancy-schmancy device...

46:15.032 --> 46:17.802
that connects your heartbeat
to the HEAT-16 bomb,

46:17.822 --> 46:21.177
so if your heart stops
ticking, the bomb goes off.

46:21.290 --> 46:22.783
We don't want any
smart-ass fruitcake...

46:22.803 --> 46:24.530
taking you out ahead of schedule.

46:24.550 --> 46:27.409
Sort of an insurance policy
from the good hands people.

46:27.429 --> 46:29.503
That's a good idea.
I like that.

46:29.523 --> 46:32.996
Now I want your special attention
dealing with Spawn, you hear me?

46:33.016 --> 46:35.012
- Gladly.
- Good.

46:35.181 --> 46:36.308
Now, stay sharp.

46:36.328 --> 46:37.604
The night is young.

46:37.782 --> 46:39.033
Ladies?

46:41.337 --> 46:42.557
Ooh, Clownie.

46:42.745 --> 46:43.871
Ah, yes.

46:43.913 --> 46:46.445
Have you ever been to a
clown's pink playpen?

46:46.583 --> 46:48.620
Well, I think it's about time.

46:50.061 --> 46:53.272
Oh, it's all good, baby.
It's all good, yeah.

46:53.292 --> 46:55.142
When all the world is mine,

46:55.800 --> 46:59.429
I will personally fry your lard-ass.

47:02.098 --> 47:03.011
As you've seen,

47:03.031 --> 47:06.019
the terrible North Korean
biochemical disaster...

47:06.159 --> 47:08.813
unleashed a whole
host of new diseases.

47:08.855 --> 47:10.898
Ten thousand people died
in the first month...

47:10.940 --> 47:12.955
after the disaster five years ago.

47:12.975 --> 47:16.237
Since then, millions of people have
contracted these fatal diseases:

47:16.279 --> 47:18.901
Diphtheria, cholera, smallpox.

47:19.108 --> 47:21.034
Diseases that had been
virtually wiped out.

47:21.075 --> 47:23.756
Thought I was getting rid
of the world's vermin,

47:24.120 --> 47:26.320
and I turn out to be one of them.

47:26.340 --> 47:28.303
...death.
With outbreaks around the world...

47:28.583 --> 47:31.419
and the number of sick and dying
children continues to grow.

47:35.878 --> 47:37.216
It's up to us to put an end...

47:37.258 --> 47:39.927
to the suffering of these
innocent children.

47:39.969 --> 47:41.066
Spaz!

47:49.062 --> 47:50.480
What happened to you?

47:51.564 --> 47:54.734
I was playing with
Spaz, and I fell down.

47:54.776 --> 47:56.215
Are you all right?

47:56.235 --> 47:58.863
Yeah, I'm OK.

48:00.448 --> 48:03.951
Wow.
Your face is weird.

48:06.579 --> 48:08.289
Cool.

48:08.331 --> 48:09.791
What's your name?

48:11.959 --> 48:13.086
Spawn.

48:13.127 --> 48:14.921
I'm Cyan.

48:16.881 --> 48:18.738
You have your mother's eyes.

48:18.758 --> 48:22.512
I knew her a long time ago.

48:22.553 --> 48:25.056
Let's get you back to your mother.

48:25.098 --> 48:27.141
My, my, my.

48:27.183 --> 48:28.768
What a pretty little dress.

48:28.810 --> 48:32.438
I wonder if she's got it in my size?

48:33.523 --> 48:35.066
Spawnie, Spawnie, he's our man.

48:35.108 --> 48:37.090
If he can't kill'em, no one can.

48:37.110 --> 48:39.092
Yay, Spawnie!

48:39.112 --> 48:42.281
"S" to the "p" to the
"a" to the "awn. "

48:42.323 --> 48:43.866
Go, Spawnie, go, Spawnie!

48:46.869 --> 48:48.997
You fool!

48:49.038 --> 48:51.270
I put you on Earth...

48:51.290 --> 48:54.752
to make sure Spawn keeps
his end of the bargain.

48:54.794 --> 48:57.422
Why'd you pick him to
lead the army anyway?

48:57.463 --> 48:58.444
What are you thinking?

48:58.464 --> 49:00.258
It should be me.

49:00.299 --> 49:02.093
I had the tenure.

49:02.135 --> 49:05.513
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

49:05.555 --> 49:07.787
And that's exactly the kind of talk...

49:07.807 --> 49:10.435
we don't tolerate around
here, right, boss?

49:10.476 --> 49:11.978
Enough!

49:12.020 --> 49:13.771
Spawn must choose...

49:13.813 --> 49:17.275
to murder Wynn and release the virus.

49:17.316 --> 49:21.529
Then my army will be complete.

49:21.571 --> 49:22.905
Now, now, boss...

49:22.947 --> 49:25.616
This is your last chance.

49:26.826 --> 49:28.036
Thank you.

49:31.247 --> 49:34.125
Excuse me.
Cyan!

49:35.585 --> 49:38.963
Honey, didn't I tell you
not to leave my sight?

49:39.005 --> 49:42.759
I was playing with
Spaz, and I fell down,

49:42.800 --> 49:45.303
and Spawn came and helped me.

49:45.345 --> 49:47.597
You're not supposed to
talk to strangers, either.

49:47.638 --> 49:49.599
Spawn's not a stranger, Mommy.

49:51.516 --> 49:52.540
Wanda!

49:53.269 --> 49:55.980
- We're going home, right now.
- What's going on, Terry?

49:57.075 --> 49:58.383
Terry, what is going on?

49:58.403 --> 49:59.998
- Explain later.
- No, explain now!

50:00.018 --> 50:02.664
I'm not going through this again...
No secrets!

50:03.096 --> 50:05.528
There was trouble at the reception.
Wynn was attacked.

50:05.932 --> 50:07.450
I don't wanna take any chances.

50:09.632 --> 50:10.620
Trust me.

50:14.036 --> 50:14.919
OK.

50:26.132 --> 50:27.470
Go home.

50:31.184 --> 50:32.799
Fix your seat belt, honey.

50:34.060 --> 50:35.905
What the hell is going on?

50:35.925 --> 50:38.310
Daddy, what about Spaz?

50:40.971 --> 50:42.041
Spaz?

50:44.332 --> 50:45.134
Spaz!

50:45.154 --> 50:46.627
Go home, Spaz.

50:47.896 --> 50:48.516
Spazy!

50:49.314 --> 50:50.064
Spaz!

50:51.239 --> 50:53.689
Honey, he knows the way back
home better than we do.

50:54.656 --> 50:56.887
- OK?
- OK.

50:58.459 --> 50:59.669
Let's go, Terry.

51:10.596 --> 51:13.016
You don't want to be where I'm going.

51:16.640 --> 51:19.767
OK, but it's your funeral.

51:39.792 --> 51:41.586
What the hell are you doing, boy?

51:42.150 --> 51:43.713
You puking up decent food?

51:43.755 --> 51:44.922
It's rotten.

51:46.984 --> 51:47.980
Tastes fine to me.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.012
You think we eat so good you can
just spit up what you like, huh?

51:51.032 --> 51:53.639
- No.
- Now, don't talk back to me.

51:59.576 --> 52:01.313
Eat this!

52:09.899 --> 52:12.433
No, don't!
He's my dad.

52:25.081 --> 52:26.624
Keep away from him.

52:30.383 --> 52:31.510
B.P. and heart rate?

52:31.530 --> 52:34.242
One-thirty-four over
77, heart rate, 60.

52:34.571 --> 52:36.862
Let's increase
the flow to 3.5.

52:40.221 --> 52:41.871
We're ready for the monitor.

52:45.005 --> 52:46.782
I'm gonna make a small incision...

52:46.802 --> 52:49.402
so that we can insert
this heart monitor.

52:49.422 --> 52:51.972
You're going to feel a slight pinch.

53:21.867 --> 53:26.158
Whoa, awesome hardware.
What are you gonna do with it?

53:26.178 --> 53:28.331
Throw someone a going-away party.

53:30.230 --> 53:31.417
Need any help?

53:32.607 --> 53:33.902
Listen, kid...

53:34.466 --> 53:36.409
I'm not looking to make friends.

53:42.379 --> 53:43.121
Hey!

53:45.870 --> 53:47.892
- What's your name?
- Zack.

53:49.224 --> 53:50.567
I'm Al.

53:51.525 --> 53:52.710
That's Spaz.

53:53.523 --> 53:54.612
Hi, Spaz!

53:54.820 --> 53:55.656
Hey...

53:57.027 --> 53:57.853
Yeah!

54:01.787 --> 54:03.458
Breathe normally, Director.

54:07.474 --> 54:10.145
The system is now operational.

54:10.648 --> 54:12.517
As per your orders, Director Wynn,

54:12.667 --> 54:15.249
if your vital signs
flat-line for any reason,

54:15.380 --> 54:18.892
the device will up-link and
detonate the HEAT-16 bombs.

54:19.487 --> 54:21.467
No one would dare kill you.

54:21.906 --> 54:24.040
Good work, Doc.

54:26.257 --> 54:28.210
What a double cross.

54:28.230 --> 54:32.182
First I got Wynn to kill Spawn
and create the HEAT-16 bomb.

54:32.202 --> 54:35.562
Now I get Spawn to murder
Wynn and release the virus.

54:36.713 --> 54:39.174
If all goes well, this
should hurt like hell.

54:40.694 --> 54:44.515
I can't believe I actually
got Wynn to get operated.

54:44.535 --> 54:46.021
What a maroon.

54:46.149 --> 54:48.757
It's going to send the
Earth into a tailspin...

54:48.777 --> 54:51.048
of death and destruction.

55:01.893 --> 55:03.152
It's time.

55:07.184 --> 55:12.082
You know, sometimes I wake up at night,
down in the alley, and wonder...

55:13.166 --> 55:14.584
Is this Hell?

55:14.983 --> 55:16.399
Not yet...

55:16.945 --> 55:18.354
but soon.

55:19.227 --> 55:20.354
Heads up.

55:22.008 --> 55:23.218
Hah, got one.

55:24.476 --> 55:26.608
So who's your new friend, Spawn?

55:26.748 --> 55:28.598
- Get out of here, Zack.
- But...

55:28.618 --> 55:29.725
Go!

55:37.649 --> 55:38.751
Miss me?

55:39.680 --> 55:41.737
Here's Clownie!

55:43.641 --> 55:47.534
So...It was you who
told Wynn to kill me.

55:47.575 --> 55:49.557
Guilty as charged.

55:50.364 --> 55:52.831
Before I blow your
fat circus ass away,

55:52.872 --> 55:55.417
I wanna know why you picked
me to lead your war.

55:55.458 --> 55:59.111
Well, well, if it isn't Curious Crispy.

55:59.928 --> 56:03.532
Your DNA spelled DOA.
We just nursed it along.

56:03.552 --> 56:07.365
All those assassin missions were
just training for what's coming.

56:08.615 --> 56:10.484
Let's get down to business.

56:10.700 --> 56:14.009
Wynn's finally got that
HEAT-16 virus bomb working.

56:14.029 --> 56:15.249
Made especially for you.

56:15.269 --> 56:17.952
Get things started with a
big, wet, infectious...

56:17.972 --> 56:19.399
Kabomb!

56:19.643 --> 56:24.228
And all you have to do is just
lead us to the holy land,

56:24.508 --> 56:26.499
so we can burn it down!

56:29.163 --> 56:31.755
You filthy
little piece of vermin.

56:31.877 --> 56:34.938
What makes you think I
would join your army?

56:34.958 --> 56:37.608
You can take your army and shove it.

56:37.628 --> 56:39.091
Sounds like a country song...

56:39.111 --> 56:41.890
"You take the army of yours and shove it."
You take that.

56:42.153 --> 56:44.598
Oh, oh, you got that, "I want
to beat the fat little man"...

56:44.640 --> 56:46.099
Look in your eye.

56:50.029 --> 56:52.479
I'm going to cut you into 50 pieces...

56:52.499 --> 56:54.545
and mail you to every state.

56:55.024 --> 56:57.611
I'm gonna take your intestines and...

57:00.107 --> 57:02.802
I don't know how you put
up with all this crap.

57:04.274 --> 57:05.850
You're a bigger fool than I thought...

57:05.870 --> 57:08.377
if you think you're going
to wreck my plans.

57:08.397 --> 57:10.874
You're gonna do just what you promised.

57:10.916 --> 57:12.535
Put down my dog.

57:13.014 --> 57:14.638
Nice doggie.

57:14.658 --> 57:16.516
Heel, fetch...

57:16.925 --> 57:18.465
No, I got it.

57:20.174 --> 57:21.582
Play dead!

57:29.684 --> 57:31.686
You want to do it the hard way?

57:32.255 --> 57:33.644
I warned you.

57:33.664 --> 57:36.746
I'm just gonna have to
teach you a lesson.

57:37.108 --> 57:39.485
No more clowning around.

57:39.505 --> 57:41.400
I'm not the vindicator...

57:41.420 --> 57:43.344
or the victimizer...

57:43.364 --> 57:46.380
or the vaporizer, or the vibrator!

57:47.285 --> 57:48.506
I'm...

57:49.226 --> 57:51.714
the violator!

58:49.900 --> 58:51.477
Oh, good Lord!

58:52.078 --> 58:53.224
Mom!

58:57.101 --> 58:58.942
Ain't staying around for this!

59:55.113 --> 59:57.170
- It ain't safe here!
- What?

01:00:07.631 --> 01:00:09.106
We're going.

01:01:21.423 --> 01:01:24.652
Violator, one, Spawnie-boy, zero.

01:01:30.769 --> 01:01:34.227
You've been violated, girlie-man, huh?

01:01:34.553 --> 01:01:36.585
I could have killed you like that.

01:01:37.323 --> 01:01:40.420
Twinkle, twinkle, little Spawn.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.908
Gosh, you look like crap.

01:01:41.928 --> 01:01:44.716
Go fertilize my lawn.

01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:47.354
What, you're not excited yet?

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:50.318
Helter-skelter's coming
down with or without you.

01:01:50.496 --> 01:01:54.462
Either you lead the army, or Wynn
plays hockey with Wanda's head.

01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:58.271
"Hey, Wanda, come on, how about giving
me some of that sweet stuff, baby. "

01:01:58.291 --> 01:02:02.716
"Oh, no.
Oh, please, Wynn, don't, please."

01:02:02.736 --> 01:02:04.939
"Somebody help me, now. "

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:08.164
You...
Stay away from her.

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:09.938
Your choice.

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:11.852
See you at Wanda's.

01:02:11.872 --> 01:02:13.393
Don't be late.

01:02:15.658 --> 01:02:18.402
Wynn and Wanda sitting in a tree,

01:02:18.422 --> 01:02:22.098
L-i-c-k-i-n-g.

01:02:25.305 --> 01:02:27.904
It seems he truth has
taken its toll on you.

01:02:29.225 --> 01:02:31.125
I'm gonna nail that asshole.

01:02:31.145 --> 01:02:33.273
You still haven't learned.

01:02:57.017 --> 01:02:58.668
Clearance granted.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:10.444
Downloading secure files.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.566
Yes!

01:03:19.289 --> 01:03:20.660
Gotcha, Jason.

01:03:24.122 --> 01:03:26.053
I can't afford to be wrong.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.110
Still with us, I see.

01:03:46.266 --> 01:03:48.766
Don't worry, Dad, the
ambulance is here.

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:53.563
Your vengeance...

01:03:53.979 --> 01:03:55.159
their pain.

01:03:55.439 --> 01:03:58.233
Wynn, Wanda...
None of this is worth the cost.

01:03:59.952 --> 01:04:02.637
Those are the only things
that matter to me now.

01:04:03.864 --> 01:04:05.314
Al Simmons is dead.

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:06.975
Let him go.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.806
I am Simmons, old man!

01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:16.664
You're Spawn now,

01:04:17.246 --> 01:04:20.044
but that doesn't mean you
have to be what they want.

01:04:29.876 --> 01:04:32.167
You're still letting them get to you.

01:04:32.187 --> 01:04:33.360
Your anger's your weakness.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:37.079
And they'll use it to rob you
of any humanity you have left.

01:04:37.239 --> 01:04:39.030
Al Simmons knew that violence...

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.466
only makes for more pain and suffering,
no matter which side gives the orders.

01:04:42.486 --> 01:04:44.363
He tried to leave off killing,

01:04:44.405 --> 01:04:46.349
give himself a second chance.

01:04:47.147 --> 01:04:48.620
Your old life is gone.

01:04:49.063 --> 01:04:50.138
Accept that.

01:04:52.612 --> 01:04:54.343
I still love Wanda.

01:04:54.567 --> 01:04:56.125
Put her in the past.

01:04:56.567 --> 01:04:58.529
It's the only way you can be free.

01:04:58.717 --> 01:05:00.970
She's the only reason I'm here.

01:05:05.392 --> 01:05:07.314
The war between Heaven and Hell...

01:05:07.505 --> 01:05:09.590
depends on the choices we make,

01:05:09.918 --> 01:05:12.472
and those choices require sacrifice.

01:05:13.365 --> 01:05:14.665
That's the test.

01:05:15.087 --> 01:05:15.810
Hey!

01:05:22.468 --> 01:05:24.693
I didn't know this
was going to happen.

01:05:26.693 --> 01:05:29.033
I'm gonna nail that dirtbag!

01:05:46.412 --> 01:05:48.018
Kiss it good-bye, Clown.

01:05:48.038 --> 01:05:51.513
This is just what they want.
You're playing their game.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.508
Then I'll play dirty.

01:05:54.528 --> 01:05:58.611
- Guns are useless.
- You got a better idea?

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:14.216
I might.

01:06:19.157 --> 01:06:22.565
You see, you've been using
your armor only by reflex.

01:06:22.753 --> 01:06:24.800
You must learn to control it.

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.383
It has trillions of neuroconnections.

01:06:27.424 --> 01:06:30.307
They're a living extension
of your own instincts,

01:06:30.327 --> 01:06:33.302
instantly translating your thought...

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.471
into physical reality,

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:38.866
so long as you stay clear and focused.

01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:44.200
- So... that's how it works.
- Yes.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.796
- Cool!
- Now try your chains.

01:07:01.693 --> 01:07:03.947
You must visualize your objective.

01:07:03.967 --> 01:07:05.177
The armor does the rest.

01:07:05.197 --> 01:07:07.534
All right, Yoda.
Just wait a second.

01:07:09.591 --> 01:07:10.755
You ready?

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.135
All right, go!

01:07:21.614 --> 01:07:22.797
Not bad.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.036
Don't get cocky.

01:07:26.141 --> 01:07:27.962
You've a lot more to learn.

01:07:28.569 --> 01:07:30.752
Your cape has its own powers.

01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:34.990
I have to get to Wanda's, old man.

01:07:37.362 --> 01:07:38.648
Take care of your powers.

01:07:38.668 --> 01:07:41.709
When you drain them, you die.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.123
No guts, no glory.

01:07:47.714 --> 01:07:49.103
You're catching on.

01:07:50.793 --> 01:07:52.531
Won't be needing this.

01:07:58.585 --> 01:08:00.867
I want you to return Spaz to me.

01:08:01.308 --> 01:08:03.853
No matter how you find him.
Understand?

01:08:08.373 --> 01:08:12.589
Hey! Hey, come back!
Get back here!

01:08:12.609 --> 01:08:13.744
Now...

01:08:14.438 --> 01:08:16.363
the final test.

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.000
Get out of my way!

01:08:32.995 --> 01:08:34.924
I'm gonna get Spawn so worked up,

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.158
he'll kill Wynn without blinking.

01:08:40.627 --> 01:08:41.568
When I'm done with you,

01:08:41.587 --> 01:08:44.144
they're gonna change
your name to "Stite. "

01:08:54.913 --> 01:08:56.557
Look, Ma, no hands!

01:09:15.872 --> 01:09:17.045
I love the smell...

01:09:17.064 --> 01:09:19.336
of burning asphalt in the morning!

01:09:27.084 --> 01:09:30.149
Send a boy to do a
clown's job, will they?

01:09:32.578 --> 01:09:36.118
It's an honor to be a
Hellspawn, you hear me?

01:09:46.377 --> 01:09:48.167
Hey, that's not fair!

01:09:51.157 --> 01:09:53.654
Time for some necro-goo!

01:09:55.799 --> 01:09:59.553
Open wide and say "Aaagh!"

01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:43.743
See you at Wanda's!

01:11:16.515 --> 01:11:18.712
Reading secure files.

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:25.742
Christ.

01:11:26.473 --> 01:11:28.689
Wynn is out of his mind.

01:11:49.217 --> 01:11:50.598
Wanda.

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:55.044
I'm thirsty.

01:11:57.319 --> 01:11:59.000
OK, baby.

01:11:59.902 --> 01:12:01.620
You want some water?

01:12:03.488 --> 01:12:05.432
Establishing connection.

01:12:07.269 --> 01:12:08.433
What have you got?

01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:11.541
Black bag ops, assassination
lists, everything.

01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:14.563
Wynn's been using A-6 to
run a criminal consortium.

01:12:14.605 --> 01:12:17.655
He's got some biological weapon.
Calls it HEAT-16.

01:12:17.999 --> 01:12:19.210
and it's all there?

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:20.966
Cos I want to get it
on tonight's news.

01:12:20.986 --> 01:12:22.838
I'm e-mailing you a copy.

01:12:22.969 --> 01:12:25.683
It should be enough to bury Wynn.
Let me know if it gets through.

01:12:25.786 --> 01:12:26.528
Great.

01:12:30.826 --> 01:12:31.690
Daddy?

01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:34.000
Hey, sweetheart.

01:12:39.496 --> 01:12:40.951
What are you doing here?

01:12:43.524 --> 01:12:45.468
Some unfinished business.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.323
Ah, you disappoint me, Terry.

01:12:56.098 --> 01:12:57.877
You can't release the virus.

01:12:57.919 --> 01:12:59.629
Millions of people will die.

01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:01.704
Only those who refuse to join me.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:05.789
Whatever it is you want,
just take it and go.

01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:07.583
I intend to.

01:13:12.357 --> 01:13:13.408
Let's go.

01:13:17.828 --> 01:13:19.002
On the floor.

01:13:20.025 --> 01:13:23.452
The kid stays with me.
Answer the door.

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:26.307
Go on.

01:13:28.356 --> 01:13:30.027
It's all right, sweetheart.

01:13:35.662 --> 01:13:37.029
Peek-a-boo.

01:13:37.071 --> 01:13:39.277
I see you.

01:13:41.254 --> 01:13:43.911
You know how hard this place
is to find in the dark?

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:46.952
It's times like these I
appreciate being a midget.

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:51.865
Ohh...
Hello, Cyan. Remember me?

01:13:55.506 --> 01:13:58.020
You were at my birthday party.

01:13:58.292 --> 01:14:00.273
No duh.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.179
What are you, a regular Einstein?

01:14:02.221 --> 01:14:03.659
You sure know how to raise them...

01:14:03.679 --> 01:14:05.617
- ...Don't you?
- Don't you touch her.

01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:07.893
Back off, hero.

01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:11.146
I'm back by popular demand.

01:14:11.268 --> 01:14:13.775
Big as life and twice as rotten.

01:14:23.578 --> 01:14:25.587
Does wonders for my asthma.

01:14:26.893 --> 01:14:28.372
Where's Spawn?

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:30.082
Let's cut the crap.

01:14:30.397 --> 01:14:33.168
Spawn's on his way.
You ready to play?

01:14:33.561 --> 01:14:34.920
Of course I am.

01:14:34.962 --> 01:14:37.008
Wynn, you better be.

01:14:41.969 --> 01:14:44.805
You don't know how much
your heart means to me.

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.510
Boo!

01:14:49.866 --> 01:14:51.125
Bring 'em, Jerky.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:53.879
Come on.

01:15:22.359 --> 01:15:24.556
-Wanda!
- Help me, please.

01:15:25.974 --> 01:15:27.306
Careful.

01:15:27.347 --> 01:15:30.476
Don't make me nervous.
I might nick something vital.

01:15:30.576 --> 01:15:33.046
You touch her, and you die slow.

01:15:33.066 --> 01:15:34.088
All right, Spawn.

01:15:34.313 --> 01:15:36.190
No more fun and games.

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:39.459
Either you join Hell's
army, or she dies...

01:15:39.647 --> 01:15:42.331
I will rip your heart out!
Let her go!

01:15:42.782 --> 01:15:44.294
So what's it gonna be?

01:15:45.543 --> 01:15:47.138
Time's running out.

01:15:51.628 --> 01:15:53.929
- Too late.
- No!

01:15:58.942 --> 01:16:00.829
Wanda.

01:16:15.158 --> 01:16:16.999
No!

01:16:17.761 --> 01:16:19.387
It's all your fault, Spawn.

01:16:19.985 --> 01:16:22.349
She was doing fine till you showed up.

01:16:22.545 --> 01:16:25.143
Now you've got nothing left to lose.

01:16:25.419 --> 01:16:27.757
For a soulless corpse!

01:16:28.188 --> 01:16:29.297
Nothing!

01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:32.692
You're wrong.

01:16:36.648 --> 01:16:38.406
I still got you.

01:16:48.088 --> 01:16:51.638
Cyan...
Don't be afraid.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:58.836
- You can't kill me.
- Is that right?

01:16:58.856 --> 01:17:01.484
If my heart stops, then
the virus is released,

01:17:01.504 --> 01:17:03.014
and everybody in the world dies.

01:17:03.034 --> 01:17:05.260
Like you said...

01:17:05.372 --> 01:17:07.710
I've got nothing else to lose.

01:17:15.977 --> 01:17:18.154
That's right.
Feel the burn.

01:17:18.174 --> 01:17:20.530
Get used to it, cos it's payback time.

01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:22.586
See you in Hell, Jason.

01:17:29.949 --> 01:17:32.425
If you kill me, you kill her!

01:18:06.323 --> 01:18:08.755
I'm through doing Hell's dirty work.

01:18:21.576 --> 01:18:24.686
You worthless bag of...

01:18:25.933 --> 01:18:27.980
How could you let him kill me?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.333
Me, the most important thing in
your entire freakin' universe!

01:18:32.438 --> 01:18:35.338
You pansy bacon-crisp!

01:18:40.194 --> 01:18:42.166
You should have killed him!

01:18:42.186 --> 01:18:45.706
Popped his head like a zit.

01:18:46.673 --> 01:18:49.227
It feels... so good.

01:18:49.588 --> 01:18:53.090
And feel that butt.
It feels so... hairy.

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:56.557
Oops!

01:18:56.614 --> 01:18:58.570
OK, joke's over.

01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:01.609
You shoulda killed Jason
when you had the chance.

01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:03.395
Never.
Never?

01:19:03.415 --> 01:19:05.971
What do you mean never?
Never?

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.575
Do you know how hard I've
been working on this?

01:19:09.595 --> 01:19:12.994
You set me up, you malignant sow!

01:19:14.018 --> 01:19:16.976
What do you think you got the
pacemaker for, turkey, huh?

01:19:16.996 --> 01:19:18.310
Your perfect attendance record,

01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:20.638
you spoon-sucking dipstick!

01:19:20.768 --> 01:19:22.566
I was counting on Spawn killing you.

01:19:22.586 --> 01:19:23.665
Then you would get his soul...

01:19:23.685 --> 01:19:26.088
and kick-start the apocalypse now.

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:27.660
Can't trust anybody.

01:19:28.076 --> 01:19:31.005
I say destroy the cosmos,
ask questions later.

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:33.018
But first...

01:19:33.794 --> 01:19:37.879
first, I wanna slaughter
each and every one of you.

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:43.416
And then I wanna have a
little crÃ¨me de Wanda.

01:19:46.808 --> 01:19:49.343
I'm gonna let you watch, too.

01:19:51.508 --> 01:19:52.883
Yummy yum.

01:19:59.485 --> 01:20:01.738
Umm, tastes like chicken.

01:20:05.146 --> 01:20:06.831
Mind if I cut in?

01:20:06.851 --> 01:20:08.690
Cogliostro!

01:20:09.366 --> 01:20:11.309
Come and get me!

01:20:11.569 --> 01:20:13.238
Suckers!

01:20:23.289 --> 01:20:24.790
He'll be back.

01:20:26.208 --> 01:20:28.002
Concentrate on healing.

01:20:28.438 --> 01:20:29.518
Come on!

01:20:34.203 --> 01:20:37.856
I may not be able to
hold him off alone.

01:20:39.848 --> 01:20:42.379
Come on down to my world!

01:21:08.115 --> 01:21:10.763
All right, you overgrown gecko...

01:21:11.364 --> 01:21:13.551
Come and get your throat cut.

01:23:05.331 --> 01:23:08.853
If you won't lead my army,

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.158
then you must die.

01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:16.187
Never!

01:23:16.207 --> 01:23:19.268
Bring me Spawn's head.

01:23:53.912 --> 01:23:56.719
You will never escape me.

01:24:20.431 --> 01:24:22.037
It's all right now, baby.

01:24:28.367 --> 01:24:29.452
Come on.

01:24:38.188 --> 01:24:39.271
You all right?

01:24:39.336 --> 01:24:41.204
They belong together.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.258
There's no place for me here.

01:24:47.177 --> 01:24:49.017
Maybe you're the one after all.

01:24:50.698 --> 01:24:53.590
You were checking me out
from the start, weren't you?

01:24:54.635 --> 01:24:56.228
I'm too old for this.

01:24:56.523 --> 01:24:58.194
Not as quick as I used to be.

01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.858
I've fought this war long enough.

01:25:00.878 --> 01:25:02.818
It's time for someone to take over.

01:25:03.308 --> 01:25:05.289
What if I sided with Clown?

01:25:06.739 --> 01:25:07.985
I'd have killed you.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.023
Right.

01:25:13.266 --> 01:25:14.346
Spaz!

01:25:21.633 --> 01:25:24.225
- I followed him here.
- Thanks, kid.

01:25:29.222 --> 01:25:30.267
Spaz?

01:26:01.852 --> 01:26:03.242
Use your armor!

01:26:08.552 --> 01:26:09.967
Concentrate!

01:26:13.103 --> 01:26:14.870
Bite this!

01:26:20.101 --> 01:26:21.726
Cut off his head!

01:26:37.686 --> 01:26:39.563
You're gonna pay for this.

01:26:41.273 --> 01:26:43.076
It's not over yet.

01:26:43.638 --> 01:26:45.140
I'll gum you to death.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.248
I'll bite ya!

01:26:47.932 --> 01:26:51.117
Hey, Wanda, what do you think
about my little head, huh?

01:26:55.225 --> 01:26:57.280
This is your last chance to join up.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.374
Think about it.

01:26:58.765 --> 01:26:59.832
Come on.

01:27:05.263 --> 01:27:06.821
You'll pay for this.

01:27:06.841 --> 01:27:09.051
Give my regards to your boss.

01:27:09.498 --> 01:27:11.188
Tell him he's next.

01:27:15.191 --> 01:27:17.126
Bow down, now.

01:27:19.163 --> 01:27:23.023
I'm gonna die!

01:27:23.065 --> 01:27:25.280
Not bad for a dead man.

01:27:25.893 --> 01:27:28.745
Oh...
Beginner's luck.

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:38.520
Mr Fitzgerald, is it true that the
documents you've uncovered...

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.667
implicate Jason Wynn?

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:43.554
Yes, that's correct. For the past five
years, I unwittingly participated...

01:27:43.574 --> 01:27:46.039
in Jason Wynn's illegal
manipulation of the A-6...

01:27:46.059 --> 01:27:48.875
in order to further his own personal
ambitions for a worldwide power.

01:27:48.895 --> 01:27:50.301
Sir, what caused you
so long to respond?

01:27:50.342 --> 01:27:53.540
Mr Fitzgerald, the HEAT-16 bombs,
are they still a danger?

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.519
The entire HEAT-16 weapon system
has already been destroyed.

01:27:58.885 --> 01:28:00.603
Do you have any further comments?

01:28:00.772 --> 01:28:02.752
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

01:28:02.772 --> 01:28:05.045
The documents that I released
to all media outlets...

01:28:05.065 --> 01:28:06.525
will take care of all the
rest of your questions.

01:28:06.567 --> 01:28:07.544
Thank you.

01:28:07.564 --> 01:28:10.400
Thank you. Natalie Ford
reporting live with CNB.

01:28:48.142 --> 01:28:49.466
Spawn has stopped...

01:28:49.486 --> 01:28:52.321
Malebolgia's plans to
destroy the Earth.

01:28:53.504 --> 01:28:55.457
The choice has been made.

01:28:57.513 --> 01:28:59.053
For now.
