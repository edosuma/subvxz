WEBVTT

01:09.760 --> 01:10.800
It wasn't me.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.600
Rose? I want you to know
that I wrote that letter.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.520
I reported you.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.480
But I didn't give it
to the p-press.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.720
Don't embarrass yourself,
Chambers.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.600
All rise!

02:20.600 --> 02:22.200
<i>In light
of these allegations,</i>

02:22.240 --> 02:26.760
<i>not only were multiple
witness statements</i>

02:26.800 --> 02:28.280
<i>deemed inadmissible</i>

02:28.320 --> 02:30.360
but the electronic messages
upon which

02:30.400 --> 02:33.160
The Crown built
its prosecution,

02:34.040 --> 02:35.920
were obtained without a warrant.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.960
I can only apologize
to the victims

02:38.000 --> 02:40.840
and their families.
The police have let you down.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.680
Mr. Hooper, you are a free man.

02:44.720 --> 02:48.320
You may apply to court
to cover your costs.

03:58.160 --> 04:02.000
<i>♪ Always a fight
Keep your mind intact ♪</i>

04:02.040 --> 04:05.040
<i>♪ Re-live the fire

04:05.080 --> 04:06.680
<i>♪ 'Cause it's over</i>

04:54.440 --> 04:55.520
Rose...

04:58.960 --> 05:00.000
Hmm...

05:07.280 --> 05:08.360
Let me get a pen.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.040
How many, by the way?

05:15.600 --> 05:16.640
How partial?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.600
Huh.

05:20.280 --> 05:24.440
153, Halcross.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.880
House...

05:34.440 --> 05:35.560
Ey up!

05:39.400 --> 05:40.920
How was traffic?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.320
There goes the neighborhood.
Etcetera.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.680
That's not your bike.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.200
I don't wanna
freak you out, ma'am,

05:46.240 --> 05:48.200
but I think
it's been, er, stolen.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.320
Oh, that fits.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.400
Listen, it beats the loony bin.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.440
Psychiatric facility.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.080
I think ''loony bin'' better
reflects my lived experience
of that absolute hellhole.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.240
Talking of hellholes...

05:59.280 --> 06:01.600
Oh. Legoland.
Next weekend. Are you in?

06:01.640 --> 06:02.840
Will you let me smoke?

06:02.880 --> 06:04.120
Eh, they'll smell it
on your clothes.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.080
So tell your nieces not
to get so close to me.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.560
- They like you.
- I can't live my life in fear
of getting hugged.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.520
Oh, that's what
you're afraid of?

06:11.560 --> 06:13.880
Not the guy you busted
for killing three lads with
a claw hammer.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.880
Brick hammer,
thinking man's claw.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.360
Didn't mind pinning him down,
disarming him.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.880
Loved it.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.160
And you know... you're okay?

06:22.200 --> 06:25.920
- You, of all people,
asking me if I'm ok--
- Hey, I'm mindful now.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.560
I've got three meditation apps
and a key of Ayahuasca
back at the flat.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.240
Good. I'm not gonna get
triggered the next time
I hear MC Hammer.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.880
Sir? Er, DI Baxter?

06:37.920 --> 06:39.760
That's Baxter, you clown.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.880
Sorry, ma'am.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.200
Thanks.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.560
I got you.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.400
The elevator's not great,
but the stairs are horrific.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.520
Hmm. Usually it's
the other way round.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.600
It's not necessarily
significant,
just an observation.

06:55.920 --> 06:56.960
It's oat milk.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.640
Thank you.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.400
How bad?
- They're going to make a podcast
out of this one.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.320
After you, ma'am.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.360
Oh, right leg belongs
to a Black male,

08:03.400 --> 08:06.080
the left leg
to a Caucasian female,

08:06.120 --> 08:08.400
the right arm
to an East Asian female,

08:08.440 --> 08:10.400
the left arm
to a Caucasian male,

08:10.440 --> 08:16.000
a Caucasian male torso
and a Caucasian male head.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.760
Well, it's not
the strangest thing
I've ever seen.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.000
- Top ten?
- Seventh?

08:23.040 --> 08:25.080
Remember the dead man alone
in the locked panic room?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.440
Oh, yeah, he was great.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.240
He was my top three,
for the sheer chutzpah.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.640
Clean cuts. Post-mortem?

08:33.400 --> 08:34.800
It's thawing.

08:34.840 --> 08:38.240
All the limbs were frozen.
The torso and head are fresh.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.840
So what are we calling this guy?
Loco Chanel?

08:40.880 --> 08:42.040
Issy Mi-yucky.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.120
Tommy Killfingers.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.960
- Michael Kor-pse.
- The Prada murdara?

08:50.800 --> 08:52.320
You've got to work your chat.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.160
What is that?

08:56.640 --> 08:59.440
Mint. I, I got it from the cafe.

08:59.480 --> 09:03.040
It's a thing in Morocco,
when you visit a leatherworks,
the cowhides smell so the--

09:03.080 --> 09:04.120
Okay.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.760
I looked
in a drug store,

09:06.800 --> 09:09.400
but all the mentholated products
contained palm oil.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.000
And I'm trying to go a year
without buying it.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.000
I thought the biggest issue
would be shampoo.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.960
Emily?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.080
Who does that look like?

09:30.440 --> 09:32.840
- Hooper.
- Mark Hooper?

09:36.200 --> 09:37.520
The Cremation Killer.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.040
And that's an example
of a lazy nickname.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.000
Because usually you get cremated
after you're dead.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.880
So it underplays
what a massive wanker
Mark Hooper actually was.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.000
But isn't Hooper in prison?

09:54.080 --> 09:55.240
Let's find out.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.680
Lemon juice.
Leave it in five minutes.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.080
Thanks.

11:08.120 --> 11:11.560
I'm sorry I, I'm taking a moment
to acclimatize.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.440
In my head, New Jersey's
filled with mobsters
doing horrible shit.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.720
Well I was a cop in my hometown,
like a college town.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.960
We had a female mayor,
lot of craft beer.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.960
The violence
was mostly economic.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.760
So it was quiet. Why d'you move?

11:23.800 --> 11:25.720
I met a British post-grad.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.320
She was leaving at the end
of the semester and I was like,
"If not now, when?"

11:29.360 --> 11:32.320
And then I spent three years
over here listening
to my professors

11:32.360 --> 11:34.200
talking about politics.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.240
And I realized, this is what
they're gonna do for the rest
of their lives,

11:36.280 --> 11:37.480
just talk.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.840
Yeah.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.800
Women from the non-profit space
still struggle to be heard,

11:44.840 --> 11:48.040
unless they have experiences
which speak to
conservative preconceptions

11:48.080 --> 11:50.160
of what constitutes
a good leader.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.800
And your solution to that
is you're gonna catch
a serial killer?

11:53.840 --> 11:56.640
Well, they're universally
unpopular.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.760
Even other white dudes are like,
"Hmm, no, he's not with us."

11:59.800 --> 12:01.640
You're very sure of yourself.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.520
I'm actually very self-critical,
because I know my potential
more than anyone.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.720
So, did you
and Rose always vibe?

12:11.760 --> 12:13.480
Well, he was
my DI to start with--

12:13.520 --> 12:15.320
But did he always
have your back,

12:15.360 --> 12:17.240
with the other guys in the unit?

12:17.280 --> 12:19.640
Yeah, I know it's blokey
but it's not <i>Lord of the Flies.
You're doing fine.</i>

12:19.680 --> 12:22.400
Anyway, being Rose's mate
was a catastrophic career move.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.680
But he was never charged,
for the assault on Mark Hooper.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.920
Rose was suffering from PTSD.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.040
He made a full recovery.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.960
Well, he was released.
They're very different things.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.800
I've got to take this,
it's Simmons.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.960
Will you start without me?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.160
It's something he ate?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.600
What, like a bad oyster?

12:46.640 --> 12:49.200
I thought prison food
was 80 to 95 percent carbs.

12:49.240 --> 12:52.360
He died Thursday
in the prison canteen.
That's all I know.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.600
Fuck a duck.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.080
And before you attempt
to be witty,

13:49.120 --> 13:51.200
these are for Baxter
and her claw-hammer chap.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.240
A brick hammer, very different.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.800
Hmm,

13:54.840 --> 13:56.760
you singlehandedly
get a murderer consecutive
life sentences

13:56.800 --> 13:58.840
and they treat you
like Mariah Carey.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.720
Technically,
he's a serial killer.

14:00.760 --> 14:04.720
Well, that threshold needs
to be higher. Three kills,
that's barely a spree.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.080
Any luck with the landlord?

14:06.120 --> 14:08.400
He sublet the flat
to a bloke online.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.040
The bloke paid in cash,
envelopes through the letterbox.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.040
Well, I've got some juicy clues.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.240
Scar on the left arm,
but that's from an op.
It's getting x-rayed.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.880
And the right arm comes
with a surprisingly good tattoo

14:19.920 --> 14:21.080
of a Pomeranian.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.880
And then there's old TBC.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.600
Hooper was killed
by tetrodotoxin,

14:53.640 --> 14:55.440
a naturally-occurring
neurotoxin.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.040
Apparently, you get it
in blowfish.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.440
I did notify your unit liaison.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.480
DI Chambers, he's on leave.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.880
Well that'll be why then.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.840
We need to speak to all
your staff and all the prisoners

15:05.880 --> 15:07.960
who ate in the canteen
the day Hooper died.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.320
Wait, what are you
talking about?

15:09.360 --> 15:11.480
Well, I'm assuming you haven't
had multiple fatalities,

15:11.520 --> 15:14.480
which means someone
in here specifically
targeted Hooper.

15:14.520 --> 15:19.080
No. Mark Hooper had recently
become the only vegan

15:19.120 --> 15:20.480
in maximum security.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.200
Oh, was that part
of a rehabilitation program?

15:23.240 --> 15:26.920
He was a sociopath.
He just wanted to feel special.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.200
I'm guessing his food
had to be prepared off-site.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.560
At great expense.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.160
Makes you want
to bring back hanging.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.840
That's why
it rings a bell.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.560
There's that episode
of <i>The Simpsons.</i>

15:40.600 --> 15:42.280
Homer's never eaten
sushi before,
he gets poisoned by a blowfish.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.120
I've never really seen the show.

15:44.680 --> 15:45.720
I know the memes.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Oh, God. Get onto the caterers.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.240
Hooper's food was either
poisoned on their premises
or in transit to the prison.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.600
My guess is, they're vegans,
they'll have crap security.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.120
I'm vegan.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.360
Oh, I mean,
that was never in doubt.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.160
- Hooper?
- He was poisoned.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.440
Die in agony?

16:18.480 --> 16:19.680
It's meant to be painless.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.360
But, long and drawn-out?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.680
Almost instantaneous.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.800
- I hate that I was right.
- No, you don't.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.800
Yeah, maybe.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.120
Just 'cause I was right,
doesn't make me well.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.960
Don't let him beat you.
Don't spin out.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.240
No one knew you were going
to move into that flat.

16:43.280 --> 16:47.320
Our man didn't stitch together
that rank Pinocchio in the time
it took you to assemble a sofa.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.200
Think about the frozen arm.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.280
This is months in the planning.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.440
So listen to me,
this is a sick coincidence,

16:54.240 --> 16:55.440
until further notice.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.880
Honestly, if it's too much,
I can get you reassigned.
I'd miss you.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.600
No. You're right.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.800
Are you comfortable?

17:23.520 --> 17:26.320
I want you to follow the light
with your eyes,

17:26.360 --> 17:27.560
from side to side.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.600
Let your mind go blank.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.080
Follow the light and tell me
where it takes you.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.480
Tell me what you notice.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.760
Tell me what you feel.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.160
<i>Where are we?</i>

17:55.200 --> 17:56.760
<i>I'm seeing
where they sent me.</i>

17:58.520 --> 17:59.600
<i>Locked me up.</i>

18:01.400 --> 18:03.640
<i>Shot me full
of tetrahedra-something.</i>

18:42.720 --> 18:43.800
<i>And this is Joel?</i>

18:45.760 --> 18:46.920
Joel, yeah.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.800
Paranoid schizophrenic,
the whole shebang.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.080
He was your neighbor
on the ward?

19:00.520 --> 19:01.760
He was my friend.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.040
<i>Why now?</i>

19:04.080 --> 19:07.760
On the day Mark Hooper's
found dead, why remember Joel?

19:07.800 --> 19:10.160
He'll kill anyone you want,
you just say the name.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.640
You spoke to him.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.680
I owed it to Teresa.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.040
<i>Mark Hooper
has been arrested and charged</i>

19:16.080 --> 19:18.640
<i>with the murder matching
the chilling and sadistic crimes</i>

19:18.680 --> 19:20.240
<i>of the Cremation Killer.</i>

19:20.280 --> 19:22.640
<i>Hooper was charged
with the murder of eight people,</i>

19:22.680 --> 19:24.840
<i>but in August,
Hooper's trial collapsed.</i>

19:24.880 --> 19:27.040
<i>When a member of
the Murder Investigation Team,</i>

19:27.080 --> 19:29.160
<i>Detective Sergeant Nathan Rose,</i>

19:29.200 --> 19:30.480
<i>was accused of obtaining</i>

19:30.520 --> 19:33.080
<i>those crucial messages
without a warrant.</i>

19:33.120 --> 19:36.240
<i>Thanks to DS Rose,
Mark Hooper was freed.</i>

19:36.280 --> 19:38.360
<i>Yesterday, he was arrested
at the scene of a murder</i>

19:38.400 --> 19:41.440
<i>bearing all the hallmarks
of the Cremation Killer.</i>

19:41.480 --> 19:43.200
<i>The victim, a man in his--</i>

20:26.120 --> 20:27.560
He went over it again and again,

20:28.720 --> 20:30.120
but he was lucid.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.960
He wanted me to know exactly
what it felt like

20:32.000 --> 20:34.760
to find his sister, Teresa.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.720
And he told you
about her murder because,
you're a police officer?

20:38.760 --> 20:40.360
Joel didn't have
any faith in us.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.480
Oh, anything
from the prison caterers?

21:05.520 --> 21:10.040
A possible intruder last week,
specifically this, silhouette.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.240
Yes! Take the rest
of the day off!

21:16.000 --> 21:17.040
Will that be all?

21:17.720 --> 21:19.000
It was just a joke.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.960
I know that there are
a lot of unknowns right now

21:22.000 --> 21:24.400
and I'm only telling you this
because I really want us
to succeed,

21:24.440 --> 21:26.120
but I do <i>not</i> respond
to that tone.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.760
Edmunds, do you mind?

21:35.080 --> 21:36.160
Yeah.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.280
I hate having to apologize
for really weak jokes.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.840
When do you ever apologize?

21:43.880 --> 21:45.800
That's what I'm saying,
I don't want to apologize.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.920
What?

21:48.280 --> 21:49.800
Nothing.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.680
Technically, today would
have been my dad's 60th.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.920
Oh, you see
your brothers tonight?

21:54.960 --> 21:56.760
- Best behavior.
- No.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.120
I can't get home in time.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.800
It's not worth showing up,
dressed like this.
Too much ammo.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.000
Sure.

They're taking the piss.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.040
Well he is the Mayor of London.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.880
You've heard him banging on
about Rose,

23:21.920 --> 23:24.560
using his mental breakdown
to score points against us.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.680
And what does "rebooting"
the police even mean?

23:27.720 --> 23:30.920
Maybe he wants to switch us off,
then switch us back on again?

23:30.960 --> 23:34.600
It's not more officers
or more support, it's cuts.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.560
- Hmm.
- Pillock.

23:36.600 --> 23:40.040
DI Baxter...
- Oh, for God's sake.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.200
Rafael Orfao. He was fourteen.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.800
And you gave his family
some closure.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.240
Be proud of yourself.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.600
Yesterday, the remains
of six people were recovered

24:04.640 --> 24:06.240
- from an address in Deptford.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.600
- On entering the apartment...
Rose?

24:18.640 --> 24:21.720
...they found
the remains of six people.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.960
- This is now being treated
as a murder investigation.
Is this a grudge?

24:26.560 --> 24:28.160
I didn't make Chambers
write that letter.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.960
- Your paper printed it.
- I defended you.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.680
You pulled
your punches, barely.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.600
I had to write something.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.680
They were desperate
to give my job to the intern.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.280
She just sits on her peachy ass
re-tweeting Reuters.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.320
So come on,
what's the deal with this?

24:43.120 --> 24:45.960
Honestly, this is a non-story.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.200
- Six dead?
- They died of boredom.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.560
Hmm.

24:50.600 --> 24:54.800
There's a poem.
It's about using sex
to deceive yourselves.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.800
It goes,

24:56.840 --> 25:00.680
"I know that you know,
that I know that you know,

25:00.720 --> 25:02.800
"that I know that you know that,

25:03.560 --> 25:05.560
"I know."

25:05.600 --> 25:07.440
That's why there's
so much money in poetry.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.760
No suspects have been identified
at this moment.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.960
We would like to invite two...

25:18.000 --> 25:21.640
The fact that you're lying
just got me really hard
for this story.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.840
-...if they have any information
on missing persons in the area.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.080
Thank you.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.040
You did great, ma'am.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.640
That's such a pointless lie.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.120
Wait for Rose.
Coordinate with missing persons.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.800
I know Andrea from years ago,
pre-Leveson days,

26:11.840 --> 26:13.440
back when we all used to drink
in the same pubs.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.880
Ah. Press-police fluidity.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.280
Well, there were fluids
involved.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.000
- Don't pull a face.
- I'm not,

26:21.040 --> 26:22.760
- pulling a face.
- Everybody did it.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.280
Chambers got his end away
with the editor of
the <i>Funday Times.</i>

26:26.320 --> 26:28.920
You are, you are pulling
a completely impassive,

26:28.960 --> 26:33.640
- dead face.
- That's so strange, because
I'm finding it hilarious.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.200
You'll get it when
he comes back from holiday.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.000
Unless he chokes
to death on a Pina Colada.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.640
How do you and Chambers maintain
a professional relationship?

26:39.680 --> 26:41.120
Oh, you mean after
I broke his arm?

26:41.160 --> 26:43.200
And his complaint about you
during the Hooper investigation,

26:43.240 --> 26:45.200
that was, that was a lot.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.920
- You read about that?
- Oh, yeah.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.440
It was my first experience
of the British tabloids.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.080
It was like watching a pack
of homeless guys

26:52.120 --> 26:54.240
trying to fuck the same dog
in a dumpster.

26:54.280 --> 26:58.000
Yeah, that's fair.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.760
Do you think
he regrets writing the letter?

27:00.720 --> 27:01.840
Would he do it again?

27:03.320 --> 27:05.160
Americans are too polite.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.840
You want to know what
a psychotic liability like me
is doing back at work.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.880
I just assumed
you were a Freemason.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.560
Get some gloves!
And get Simmons!

27:21.040 --> 27:22.240
We don't know
it's from...

27:22.280 --> 27:25.160
Donatella Ver-sach-eurgh?

27:25.200 --> 27:26.680
You do get a lot of post.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.160
Rose has admirers
from the Hooper trial.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.360
A lot of whatever
the kind word is for cat-ladies.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.680
The Rose Buds. The Moan Roses.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.880
They send me knickers,
unsolicited photos...

27:36.920 --> 27:38.000
Please don't be proud of that.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.960
One. Ray Turnbull.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.920
Sir, do you think we should
be concerned he could mean

27:54.960 --> 27:56.640
the Ray Turnbull,
the Mayor of London?

27:56.680 --> 27:59.040
Yes. DC,
State-the-Shitting-Obvious.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.760
It's DC Edmunds, sir.

28:03.680 --> 28:07.040
Two, Nick Hooper.
Three, Eric Turner.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.720
Four, Matthew Wingate.
Five, Andrew Daly.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.520
Six, Nathan Rose.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.200
Nate?

28:36.280 --> 28:37.320
Nothing.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.320
I mean, it is what it is.
It's not that bad.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.560
You're on a kill list.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.920
Well, we always knew
I had a certain,

28:44.960 --> 28:46.880
- Marmite quality.
That's the spirit.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.480
With me, Houdini.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.040
Marmite is a kind of
tarry yeast.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.800
I'm sorry. Sorry, DCI Simmons,
but is that appropriate?

28:52.840 --> 28:55.560
Is it smart to involve Rose?
It is not personal.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.920
Clearly, he antagonizes
the killer, plus the Mark Hooper
of it all?

28:58.960 --> 29:03.120
This doodling prick
doesn't get to dictate who's
on my team, and nor do you.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.760
There are two sets
of people we need to ID.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.480
First, the body parts
recovered yesterday.

29:17.520 --> 29:21.400
The individual, arms, legs
and torso, sewn together into
the whatever-we're-calling-it.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.480
Edward Different-Hands?

29:23.160 --> 29:24.880
The Ragdoll?

29:24.920 --> 29:26.840
Ragdoll it is, nice and simple.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.240
Whoa, who's this guy?

29:29.560 --> 29:31.160
I'm a technical officer.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.760
The projector wasn't working.
It's a good thing I was here.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.800
You're kidding me?
I.T. get to name
our grisly discoveries?

29:36.840 --> 29:38.520
Second...

29:38.560 --> 29:42.800
the list of six names
DS Rose received
in the post today.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.400
One has been identified
as the Mayor, Ray Turnbull.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.720
Another has been identified
as DS Rose.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.600
I want armed protection officers
on every entrance.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.880
Stop the lifts.
Turn off the air.

30:24.680 --> 30:27.000
These protection lads
do my head in.

30:27.040 --> 30:31.200
I was on my way here anyway
and they pitch up and bundle me
into the back of the car.

30:31.240 --> 30:35.960
Ray! This isn't a joke.
This-is-happening now!

30:37.760 --> 30:41.120
Well, I didn't want
to stand around making speeches
outside, anyway.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.240
My hay fever's rank
in this weather.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.480
Your asthma's rank
all year round.
What about the children?

30:45.520 --> 30:46.760
They're all in France.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.400
Oh, shit.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.480
There is another one, too,
different mom.

30:50.520 --> 30:51.840
Keep it under your hat.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.200
Please don't stop, sir.
It's just the 11 floors to go.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.240
What did I ever do to you?

31:11.280 --> 31:14.280
I remember you calling me
a "fascist" on television.

31:14.920 --> 31:15.960
Chop, chop.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.320
What is this,
a florist?

31:34.080 --> 31:35.160
Just in here.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.320
All right. I'd get comfortable.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.560
What are you gonna do?

31:44.880 --> 31:45.920
Catch the prick?

31:48.160 --> 31:49.280
Will that take long?

32:11.400 --> 32:13.120
Ma'am!

32:13.160 --> 32:15.840
Hmm.
- The tattoo, the Pomeranian.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.680
I thought it was a fat husky.

32:17.720 --> 32:22.040
It's all drawn in one
continuous line. It's by
an artist called Hau, H-A-U.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.840
- What is this?
- Scroll down.

32:25.280 --> 32:28.680
Look, there's the Pomeranian
or fat husky.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.240
Where is he?

32:31.280 --> 32:34.000
Hau is doing a residency
at a studio called
Halloween Parade.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.320
- It's...
- I know it.
It's off the Stockwell Road.

32:36.360 --> 32:39.320
And it's 100 meters
from the spot where
Rafael Orfao was murdered.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.840
Come on.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.040
Or even ten years ago,

32:47.080 --> 32:48.840
if you had
a bloody huge neck tattoo,

32:48.880 --> 32:52.560
I'd arrest you on principle.
Now you just look like
any another barista.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.760
How do you know about
all this shit?

32:58.160 --> 32:59.240
Oh, okay.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.200
Jesus!

33:02.520 --> 33:04.880
As long as it stays
under the uniform, yes?

33:04.920 --> 33:09.240
Yeah. Don't worry,
my therapist says this is
about compartmentalization.

33:09.280 --> 33:12.520
Ah, so the risk is the reward?

33:12.560 --> 33:17.000
You get a kick from trusting
a stranger to give you
a pre-determined scar?

33:17.040 --> 33:20.240
Yeah, the trust
is kinda non-negotiable.

33:20.280 --> 33:23.520
I dated someone who tried
to tattoo an X on their own arm,

33:23.560 --> 33:26.080
- ended up looking like
a swastika.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.760
Ironically she broke up with me
for becoming a cop.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.440
Fair enough.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.600
I wanna piece of like,

33:33.640 --> 33:36.720
like sacred geometry.
Actually I was inspired
by your flowers.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.320
- Those dahlias.
- Ah.

33:39.360 --> 33:42.480
- If you want them,
you can have them.
- Oh, no, ma'am.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.320
It's super-important
to let yourself accept praise.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.880
You know what?
Just wait in the car.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
Sarnie? It's cheese.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.040
Shut the door!

34:07.160 --> 34:09.200
I'm getting a back-draft
of bloody pollen.

34:11.320 --> 34:14.160
This erm, this Ragdoll.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.360
We're not definitely calling
it that.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.720
The killer's got a bee
in their bonnet
about Mark Hooper.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.840
Yeah. I imagine
it's about that photo shoot.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.560
Mark Hooper, shaking your hand
from his hospital bed.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.520
Listen, I will never condone
brazen police brutality.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.920
Maybe it plays in Brexit-on-Sea.

34:28.960 --> 34:33.680
Not in London.
Now, if Hooper had mysteriously
died in his cell one night.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.200
- Right, so if I'd done
an Epstein,

34:35.240 --> 34:38.440
- hanged him with
his paper pajamas.
- You'd be DCI.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.120
Detective? Is there a problemo?

34:55.160 --> 34:57.280
No, no. No big problemo. Eh...

34:58.640 --> 35:00.080
they, si, eh...

35:01.920 --> 35:05.560
I just want to protect
my community
to the best of my abilities.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.320
I'm not looking
for any special treatment.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.320
I'd...

35:09.360 --> 35:14.320
Oh, obrigada. Erm,
I don't want my colleagues

35:14.360 --> 35:17.160
to think that this is harder
for me than it is for them,

35:17.200 --> 35:19.480
because that could affect
the way that we communicate.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.880
I am so sorry,
I don't understand.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.240
DI Chambers helped me
catch your son's killer.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.480
Would you send him flowers?

35:27.520 --> 35:29.080
I did not no send no flowers.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.560
Oy!

35:44.880 --> 35:47.080
So you've got nothing
against brutality in principle?

35:47.120 --> 35:48.560
There's celery in this.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.120
I don't even care anymore,
I'm having a cigarette.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.040
- People love a maverick.
- Isn't that the truth?

36:04.080 --> 36:05.960
Put a sock over the fire alarm
will you?

36:06.360 --> 36:07.640
Call Rose!

36:50.600 --> 36:53.200
Help! Help!

37:04.040 --> 37:06.360
Baxter! You were meant
to be watching him.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.960
He'll kill anyone you want,
you just say the name.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.200
The deal is, he'll kill you too.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.360
Who did this?

38:11.400 --> 38:13.360
- Nathan.
- Sorry.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.920
I'm glad to see you looking
so well.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.240
Yeah. I'm here to see er,
Joel Shepton.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.120
Ah.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.280
I'm afraid Joel died.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.200
He hanged himself
twelve months ago.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.920
Thank you.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.680
Do you want me to come up?

39:20.720 --> 39:22.440
No, you're all right.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.640
I don't think he's going to be
hiding under my bed.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.640
This guy's
got loftier ambitions.

39:31.520 --> 39:32.760
You know you can talk to me.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.360
Yeah, always.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.320
- Ah it's a good one.
- Hmm.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.840
You know the lady in the flat
below me is a schizophrenic.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.520
Or at least er,
she acts like my neighbor

39:54.560 --> 39:56.120
in the loony bin,
this guy named Joel.

39:58.160 --> 40:01.920
Only, she puts on music
to drown out the screams.

40:01.960 --> 40:05.280
The thing is, it's really good.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.320
So most nights I find
myself Shazamming her episodes.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.600
You're the reason
I'm here, Baxy.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.520
The only reason.

40:30.760 --> 40:31.800
Hmm.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.720
Get some sleep, mate.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.080
Yeah, yeah.

40:47.400 --> 40:48.560
Yeah.

41:18.320 --> 41:20.000
<i>It's late, Nathan.</i>

41:28.520 --> 41:32.440
Do you think he was driven mad
by his quest for justice?

41:32.480 --> 41:36.440
- You don't deserve to die, Joel.
- I will die with peace of mind.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.160
Joel told me about The Faust.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.520
You go to The Faust.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.920
And you name one person
you want dead.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.040
Deal is, he'll kill you too.

41:57.960 --> 42:01.200
So you did this?
You spoke to him?

42:02.320 --> 42:03.360
I owe it to Teresa.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.640
It's not meant to be cruel.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.600
So Joel named
his sister's killer.

42:09.640 --> 42:12.920
So he put his,
his faith in a higher power?

42:12.960 --> 42:14.480
I guess he lived in hope.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.280
An eye for an eye,

42:17.520 --> 42:19.000
a wild justice?

42:21.160 --> 42:22.480
Does that appeal to you?

42:22.520 --> 42:25.440
Let me have it, the number.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.280
Are you sure?

42:29.000 --> 42:30.040
Here.

42:48.840 --> 42:51.120
Do you think
The Faust is real?

42:51.160 --> 42:52.720
Is that why
you called me tonight?

42:54.600 --> 42:55.840
Did you believe him?

43:02.920 --> 43:04.000
Nathan?

43:22.880 --> 43:24.120
The Faust isn't real.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.720
Are you sure?

43:33.320 --> 43:34.880
This is Nathan Rose.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.800
I want you to kill Mark Hooper.
