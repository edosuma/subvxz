00:31.231 --> 00:32.331
- Rita.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.137
Rita!

00:43.810 --> 00:45.477
Aw come on, guys!

00:51.151 --> 00:53.652
Come on, I'm not in the mood!

01:00.161 --> 01:01.627
This isn't funny!

01:06.699 --> 01:08.700
This isn't even clever!

01:14.275 --> 01:18.544
Dammit Randy, I'll buy you
a new carpet all right?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.546
Sorry.

01:24.484 --> 01:25.784
Hey if you wanted to scare me

01:25.786 --> 01:28.120
you could've tied me up better.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.692
Okay.

01:44.471 --> 01:45.471
Okay.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.716
Come on.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.187
Hello?

03:08.788 --> 03:09.788
Hello?

03:12.458 --> 03:13.892
Can anyone hear me?

03:15.728 --> 03:17.696
I'm trapped in a
cabin somewhere,

03:17.698 --> 03:20.199
I don't really know where it is.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.267
I'm uh, surrounded by...

03:24.537 --> 03:25.537
Trees.

03:26.639 --> 03:27.806
Uh, mayday.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.641
I don't know where I am, please,

03:29.643 --> 03:32.644
if anyone can hear
me, please help.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.829
Think, think, okay.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.901
Picked up Rita,
okay, I had a drink.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.705
I had two drinks.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.708
Then uh, then I came home.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.278
Did I get home?

04:09.682 --> 04:10.749
Was I drunk?

04:12.318 --> 04:14.786
No, no, no, no, no, no,
come on, come on, come on.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.721
Don't lose it, all right?

04:16.724 --> 04:18.790
Okay, all right.

04:18.791 --> 04:19.791
Okay, good.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.493
Let's see what...

04:22.262 --> 04:25.330
Okay.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.966
Of course.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.449
Hello?

05:50.451 --> 05:51.750
Hello?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.819
- Lester.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.555
- Who is this?

05:56.557 --> 05:59.925
- Your friends call you les.

05:59.927 --> 06:00.927
- Who is this?

06:02.528 --> 06:05.664
Look mister, please, I need
help, I'm trapped in a cabin

06:05.666 --> 06:06.998
and I have no idea where I am.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.934
I think maybe if
you GPS it, though,

06:08.936 --> 06:10.969
you'll be able to find me.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.571
- It's
going to be very difficult

06:12.573 --> 06:14.139
if you keep interruptin', les.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.908
Now calm down, can you do that?

06:16.910 --> 06:17.910
- Yes, yes.

06:19.579 --> 06:21.780
- Good, now
how 'bout you take a seat

06:21.782 --> 06:23.148
right there?

06:23.150 --> 06:24.816
- Yes.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.452
- You know
all about comfort, don't you?

06:27.454 --> 06:31.590
Complacency, ease,
goin' out on the town

06:31.592 --> 06:33.959
dressed to the nines and such.

06:34.861 --> 06:37.462
Allow me to introduce myself.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.064
You may call me wolf.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.002
- Wolf?

06:44.904 --> 06:47.038
Wolf like the guy on CNN?

06:49.842 --> 06:53.044
- Yeah, just
like the guy on CNN.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.816
I have brought you here, Lester.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.951
- You brought me here?

06:59.953 --> 07:00.752
You brought me here?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.053
What the hell for?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.955
- Would you hush up?

07:03.957 --> 07:06.491
I know we about your situation.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.059
- Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.830
My family will give
you whatever you want.

07:13.866 --> 07:14.966
Hello?

07:16.803 --> 07:17.803
Wolf?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.914
- I was hopin'
i wouldn't have to pull

08:35.916 --> 08:39.918
some cuyon parlor trick
to keep ya here, Lester.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.753
You rushed my hand.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.090
As I was sayin' before
you interrupted,

08:45.092 --> 08:48.226
it makes conversation
very difficult.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.830
- Just tell me what you want.

08:52.999 --> 08:52.998
- That's the first time

08:53.000 --> 08:58.770
you ever been scared for your
life, isn't it silver spoon?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.038
- Silver spoon?

09:02.041 --> 09:05.810
I'll give you silver
spoon, you psycho.

09:05.812 --> 09:09.814
Why don't you come in here
and I'll knock you so hard.

09:09.816 --> 09:12.217
My family is going
to sue your ass.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.052
Do you get that?

09:14.054 --> 09:17.022
My uncle is a Jewish
lawyer, my friend,

09:17.024 --> 09:19.758
that means jail time!

09:19.760 --> 09:21.960
You could get real
acquainted with bubba.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.930
- Feel like a big man now?

09:24.932 --> 09:27.966
Now you tried to rush off before
i could tell you the rules.

09:27.968 --> 09:31.002
Now in ever sport,
there's rules.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.038
Ready to listen?

09:40.880 --> 09:41.880
- Yes.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.115
- Tres bon.

09:45.618 --> 09:49.087
You are here les
because you have sinned.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.591
Well you committed the
worst sin a boy like you

09:52.593 --> 09:53.593
can commit.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.228
Irre-sponsi-bili-Ty.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.904
You've wasted your life.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.907
That's all you is,
a middle manager

10:10.109 --> 10:12.210
at papa's company.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.080
Still livin' in the glory
days of your frat house.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.749
Women's objects, classic

10:19.853 --> 10:22.621
that's an awful nice
watch you're wearin'.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.656
Daddy get that, too?

10:24.658 --> 10:27.726
When a boy like you
lives the way he does,

10:27.728 --> 10:30.061
there's poison in his life.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.931
I'm the anti-venom.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.135
- What are you talking about?

10:38.070 --> 10:39.738
- Manhood.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.110
Les, you know the Indians,
they had these rituals

10:45.112 --> 10:49.080
where they send their boys
off in the woods to survive.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.849
And when they came back

10:50.851 --> 10:52.751
and if they came back,

10:54.820 --> 10:58.289
they earned the right
to be called a man.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.926
- You've gotta be kidding me.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.097
- You will learn les.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.233
Sacrifice, honor, pain...

11:11.704 --> 11:14.372
These ain't catch
phrases no more.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.307
It is your new life.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.279
- What is this?

11:23.749 --> 11:27.986
- Les, if you try to
leave the cabin, I'll kill you.

11:29.288 --> 11:32.424
And if by some miracle
you get past me,

11:32.426 --> 11:35.093
the wilderness will kill you.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.797
Now there's only one
way off this mountain,

11:38.799 --> 11:41.833
so you best listen closely.

11:41.835 --> 11:45.136
You have to man-up les, not
a mindless, wanna-be jock,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.138
but a real man, a

11:48.141 --> 11:50.208
who can take care of hisself.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.311
A man who can take a
hit and keep moving.

11:53.313 --> 11:57.015
Oh I will help you do that, les.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.083
I will help.

12:00.786 --> 12:03.421
I will just as
soon end you, too.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.258
You see, I am the hunter...

12:09.061 --> 12:13.164
But I dare not even call
you prey, no, not yet.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.800
Prey presents a challenge.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.502
So help me god, by
the end of this,

12:17.504 --> 12:21.306
you will present me
with a challenge.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.909
Try to break the rules
and I'll end you.

12:26.178 --> 12:29.347
Run down that path
again, find out.

12:31.383 --> 12:35.386
Now, you have the rest
of the day to settle in.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.322
Use it.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.758
The hunt is on.

14:08.180 --> 14:12.417
- Come on, can do this.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.337
If anyone is out
there, please respond.

14:36.508 --> 14:40.044
If anyone is out
there, please respond.

15:02.468 --> 15:05.904
If anyone can hear
me, please respond.

16:13.739 --> 16:14.739
Wolf!

17:24.609 --> 17:26.544
Where are the boots?

19:10.782 --> 19:13.551
What?

19:16.455 --> 19:18.623
- You did a very
bad thing yesterday,

19:18.625 --> 19:19.891
tryin' to escape.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.528
- You tried to shoot me.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.864
- I shot at you.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.534
Big difference,
let me assure you.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.669
- You were here last night.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.472
Why didn't you just
finish it then, tough guy?

19:34.474 --> 19:37.875
If you're some hotshot hunter,
why didn't you just kill me?

19:37.877 --> 19:41.279
- Listen, you find
yourself in a tootaloo,

19:41.281 --> 19:44.282
you ain't gotta call nobody.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.485
It's up to you to figure it out.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.720
- I find myself in a what?

19:50.722 --> 19:54.559
- You're gonna
slowly freeze to death.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.861
Now shut up and listen to me.

20:00.465 --> 20:01.465
- Okay.

20:03.635 --> 20:07.705
- There's a safe, no
doubt you found it by now.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.207
- I saw it, yeah.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.412
- Inside the cabin
somewhere is the combination.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.847
You oughtta get to gettin'.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.516
- Find the combo?

20:20.719 --> 20:23.721
All right and after
you amuse yourself

20:23.723 --> 20:25.957
watching me tear this
place apart, what then?

20:25.959 --> 20:26.791
What are you gonna do?

20:26.793 --> 20:28.492
Kill me?

20:28.494 --> 20:32.363
Why don't you just come in
here and face me like a man?

20:32.365 --> 20:33.497
Or are you too scared, huh?

20:33.499 --> 20:33.497
Why don't you come in here

20:33.499 --> 20:38.236
so that I can pound
your little face in?

21:10.502 --> 21:13.037
I'm tired of your game, asshole.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.661
Run, run, run, run.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.774
- Les?

21:51.943 --> 21:54.312
If you're there, pick up.

21:59.852 --> 22:00.818
- I'm here, wolf.

22:00.820 --> 22:01.652
Where are you friend?

22:01.654 --> 22:03.487
I've got my gun back.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.658
- I have to admit,
I'm right proud of you, boy.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.929
You must feel like a big boy,
goin' break the eggs and such.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.931
- Come on wolf, let's do this.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.666
Let's do this, I'm
waitin' for you, wolf.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.902
Come on, come and kill me!

22:18.770 --> 22:22.840
- Well,

22:24.910 --> 22:27.111
- what's your endgame, wolf?

22:27.113 --> 22:29.013
Do you honestly think
you can just keep me here

22:29.015 --> 22:30.815
and get away with it?

22:33.485 --> 22:35.019
- How's Rita?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.360
- Rita?

22:43.995 --> 22:46.797
- Your girlfriend?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.799
- You have her?

22:48.801 --> 22:52.970
- Relax, I'm
askin' about her, ain't I?

22:52.972 --> 22:54.939
How is she, doin' good?

22:57.409 --> 22:58.409
- Shut up.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.913
- Yeah, that's the
twisted thing about our culture,

23:02.915 --> 23:05.683
we don't believe in honor.

23:05.685 --> 23:09.820
It's a word without meanin'
that some of the marines use

23:09.822 --> 23:12.089
in their commercials.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.691
That's about it.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.095
- Rita's just fine.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.698
- Don't kid yourself.

23:20.700 --> 23:24.769
She just busted into tears
just a few night ago.

23:26.805 --> 23:29.140
- When I get out of here,
I'm gonna put a bullet

23:29.142 --> 23:31.575
through your skull.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.911
- That's a bold assumption.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.980
When you get out?

23:35.982 --> 23:36.982
Try if.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.651
The wolf ain't done hurtin'.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.991
- I don't think so.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.796
I'll sit right here
and wait for you.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.769
- That's too bad.

23:58.771 --> 24:03.574
I just left a little
present for you by the shed.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.200
- Oh, come on baby.

26:51.009 --> 26:52.977
That's good.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.145
That's good, that's good.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.247
Yes!

26:57.249 --> 26:59.683
Yes!

27:09.628 --> 27:10.628
Hey!

27:57.409 --> 27:58.409
Okay, okay.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.285
Fire.

29:57.929 --> 29:58.929
Fire.

30:06.237 --> 30:10.474
The ability to
start and maintain a fire

30:11.576 --> 30:14.311
is crucial to a
marine's survival

30:14.313 --> 30:16.513
in the cold weather theater.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.884
Too bad I'm not a marine.

30:20.886 --> 30:24.321
You will need kindling,
an ignition source,

30:26.057 --> 30:29.426
fuel for the fire,
a steady oxygen flow

30:29.428 --> 30:32.095
and a means by which to...

30:35.366 --> 30:38.368
I'm gonna die.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.396
All right, now you listen to me.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.333
If you want some prey and if
you're some hotshot hunter,

31:09.335 --> 31:11.635
then you're gonna
have to keep me alive.

31:11.637 --> 31:14.638
Now tell me how
to start the fire.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.173
I know you can see me.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.541
Hey, you see that?

31:18.543 --> 31:21.311
Tell me how to start the fire.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.882
- I gave you dinner,

31:24.884 --> 31:27.918
now you want me to
cook it for you, too?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.320
Aren't you so suave?

31:38.930 --> 31:41.465
- Look, you want
to keep me alive.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.900
More sporting.

31:44.235 --> 31:47.371
- You don't know
nothin' about sportin'.

31:47.373 --> 31:51.308
- Maybe, but I can take
a few guesses about you.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.443
You aren't from around
here, I can guess that.

31:53.445 --> 31:56.046
Not with that stupid
hillbilly accent of yours

31:56.048 --> 31:58.348
which means you trained
to stay up here.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.284
You're good with
guns and survival.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.585
The manual you gave me
is from the marines,

32:01.587 --> 32:03.420
not to mention that little
bit about commercials.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.657
So you're a marine,
or were, at least.

32:06.659 --> 32:08.358
You know you're probably
some washed out old guy

32:08.360 --> 32:10.394
talkin' 'bout the
glory days of 'nam

32:10.396 --> 32:12.362
who likes stalking rich kids!

32:12.364 --> 32:14.464
You're just havin' fun
with me, aren't ya?

32:14.466 --> 32:16.466
My dad is probably
dumping ransom money

32:16.468 --> 32:18.201
into some offshore account

32:18.203 --> 32:20.637
and any day now a helicopter
is going to land and save me

32:20.639 --> 32:23.373
and you're just screwin'
with me til then.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.977
Yeah, this, this is
nothing but a ransom.

32:26.979 --> 32:30.447
You're a thief and
that's all that it is.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.550
- Wanna eat?

32:34.585 --> 32:37.321
- Oh why yes,
please, mister wolf.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.990
I'll jump through whatever
hoops you want me to.

32:39.992 --> 32:43.226
I'll sing and I'll
dance for you, too.

32:48.667 --> 32:49.667
Hey!

32:51.302 --> 32:52.302
Hey, stop!

32:53.438 --> 32:54.438
Hey!

32:55.139 --> 32:56.139
Hey, stop!

32:58.476 --> 32:59.476
Stop!

33:00.611 --> 33:01.611
Wait!

33:05.683 --> 33:09.553
Hold on a minute.

33:10.555 --> 33:11.555
Hey, easy.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.291
Look...

33:16.094 --> 33:17.160
I was taken.

33:18.396 --> 33:21.598
I'm just looking for
a way out of here.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.567
Do you speak English?

33:25.104 --> 33:27.204
Easy, easy, easy,
calm down, calm down.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.441
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.443
Okay, okay.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.212
All right.

33:36.615 --> 33:37.681
Sorry buddy.

33:39.550 --> 33:40.650
It's all right.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.623
Do you know English?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.191
- Yes.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.127
- Oh thank god.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.129
Okay.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.097
Okay, I just...

33:55.633 --> 33:57.134
I'm stuck here.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.669
I mean I was put here.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.640
All right.

34:07.111 --> 34:09.179
I just, there's a cabin.

34:12.449 --> 34:13.683
Hey, what?

34:13.685 --> 34:16.253
All right, easy, easy.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.088
It's cool, it's cool.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.725
I woke up in a chair and I...

34:27.398 --> 34:29.466
Do you know how to cook?

34:31.502 --> 34:34.538
Then I saw a sheep in the tree.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.574
I tried to cut it
down the best I could.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.543
I think I saw you.

34:39.545 --> 34:40.744
- I was trying to sneak around.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.246
- Ah, when did you wake up?

34:44.248 --> 34:45.549
- About two days ago.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.317
- Sounds about right.

34:47.319 --> 34:50.353
Do you have your own cabin
somewhere around here or?

34:50.355 --> 34:53.422
- No, he made a
snow shelter for me.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.227
That's where I've been.

34:58.696 --> 35:00.697
He told me how to make
a fire and a spear.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.833
- Whoa, hold on,
you can make a fire?

35:02.835 --> 35:03.733
- Yeah.

35:03.735 --> 35:07.771
- If you can make
fire, then we can cook.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.507
We can eat, come on,
come on, let's go.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.144
- Why did he give you a cabin?

35:14.146 --> 35:17.681
- Well, he wanted to teach me
to be a real man, you know?

35:17.683 --> 35:20.884
Be all tough and cool and manly.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.787
- No, why did he
give you a cabin

35:23.789 --> 35:26.823
and I get a hole in the ground?

35:26.825 --> 35:28.825
- I don't know.

35:28.827 --> 35:32.329
Maybe he doesn't,
i mean, you know,

35:32.331 --> 35:34.264
maybe he doesn't like your kind.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.266
- My kind?

35:36.234 --> 35:38.535
- Well yeah, you're
Mexican, right?

35:38.537 --> 35:41.605
- Are you serious?

35:41.607 --> 35:43.140
- Yeah I'm serious.

35:43.142 --> 35:45.375
Look, he's trying to
teach you a lesson,

35:45.377 --> 35:46.710
so what lesson is he
trying to teach you?

35:46.712 --> 35:49.613
I mean are you
allowed to be here?

35:51.315 --> 35:52.449
- Oh wow.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.284
- No, it's cool.

35:54.286 --> 35:54.284
I'm cool.

35:54.286 --> 35:58.855
Look, I'm from the oc, I got
like two Mexican friends,

35:58.857 --> 36:00.323
they got like a
hundred legal cousins.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.692
- Oh you have two
Mexican friends?

36:02.694 --> 36:04.661
Multicultural.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.597
You think I'm here
because I'm Mexican?

36:07.599 --> 36:08.899
You're a jackass.

36:13.304 --> 36:17.207
He told me that I need
to stand up for myself.

36:19.443 --> 36:20.443
- Oh.

36:22.647 --> 36:23.647
My bad.

36:30.755 --> 36:31.788
I am starving.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.560
I am sopping wet.

36:38.462 --> 36:40.597
And I am freezing.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.839
Well, start us some fire.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.448
Do you need help?

37:00.651 --> 37:03.687
- I want you to go away.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.255
- What?

37:05.257 --> 37:07.757
- If you see how to make
fire, I'm not useful to you.

37:07.759 --> 37:07.757
You can throw me out.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.927
- Come on,
you've gotta be kidding.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.763
I'm not going to do
anything like that.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.266
- Do you want to eat?

37:20.538 --> 37:21.605
- All right.

37:23.274 --> 37:24.608
Cool your jets.

37:42.326 --> 37:44.761
You're out there
right now, aren't you?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.596
You're watching us.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.000
Why'd you send her here, wolf?

37:56.741 --> 37:59.943
Ah, you can probably
see me right now.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.544
Why is she here?

38:06.417 --> 38:09.552
For whatever reason, she
isn't gonna stick around long.

38:09.554 --> 38:11.021
I'll figure it out.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.059
- It ain't hard.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.927
- What did you say?

38:19.630 --> 38:23.033
- I say it ain't
hard to figure out.

38:23.035 --> 38:25.735
I sent her there to kill you.

38:27.772 --> 38:30.440
- Why doesn't that surprise me?

38:36.380 --> 38:38.048
I can't tell, wolf.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.916
I can't tell if you're
trying to kill me

38:39.918 --> 38:41.951
or tryin' to help me.

38:43.788 --> 38:47.924
- Well then, I better
send you a clear message.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.993
- Yeah, and what's that?

38:53.731 --> 38:54.731
Wolf?

38:56.767 --> 38:57.867
Wolf?

39:17.888 --> 39:18.888
- Oc?

39:22.793 --> 39:23.760
- Hmm?

39:23.762 --> 39:26.730
- You're from orange county?

39:26.732 --> 39:27.732
- Yeah.

39:30.501 --> 39:34.871
- I had family there
once, they've moved back.

39:34.873 --> 39:35.939
I was trying to
get an internship...

39:35.941 --> 39:38.108
- how did you get my boots?

39:38.110 --> 39:39.110
- Hmm?

39:40.778 --> 39:43.513
- You were wearing my boots.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.581
Those boots.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.851
How did you get them?

39:48.886 --> 39:50.687
- I don't understand.

39:57.962 --> 39:58.962
- You know...

40:01.966 --> 40:05.034
Two days ago, I was
a different guy.

40:05.836 --> 40:07.170
You see that's the weird thing,

40:07.172 --> 40:09.439
I don't know who I am anymore.

40:09.441 --> 40:11.508
And I sure as hell
don't know who you are.

40:11.510 --> 40:12.675
- My name is Viviana.

40:12.677 --> 40:14.010
- I didn't ask.

40:15.045 --> 40:17.981
I said how did you get my boots?

40:18.916 --> 40:20.850
- Those aren't your boots.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.720
- Why did he send you?

40:24.990 --> 40:25.989
Shut up!

40:25.991 --> 40:27.424
Why did wolf send you?

40:27.426 --> 40:29.125
- He gave me the boots.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.560
- Start talkin' Viviana.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.429
- I told you he
gave me the boots.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.798
- You know I never touched
one of these things,

40:34.800 --> 40:36.132
but I think if I can gut a sheep

40:36.134 --> 40:37.434
then I can gut you, too.

40:37.436 --> 40:38.436
- No!

40:39.470 --> 40:41.871
He told me that i
needed to kill that,

40:41.873 --> 40:43.940
that I need to take your
things and I would die

40:43.942 --> 40:45.008
if I didn't action for myself.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.443
- You?

40:46.445 --> 40:47.610
You kill me?

40:47.612 --> 40:48.878
You kill me?

40:48.880 --> 40:51.748
- No, no I

40:51.750 --> 40:52.982
- ah, shut up!

40:56.520 --> 40:59.189
Are you enjoying the show?

40:59.191 --> 41:00.123
Huh?

41:00.125 --> 41:02.859
- Are you out of your mind?

41:02.861 --> 41:04.494
- Well you're here to kill me,

41:04.496 --> 41:06.196
so I guess it's pretty fair.

41:19.677 --> 41:23.146
We're gonna die out
here, do you know that?

41:29.053 --> 41:30.053
Sorry.

41:32.957 --> 41:35.692
- Yeah, sure, it's all forgiven.

41:54.044 --> 41:58.281
- I see
it, but I don't believe it.

41:59.717 --> 42:01.851
Is that Lester workin'?

42:01.853 --> 42:04.687
I mean is he actually workin'?

42:08.125 --> 42:10.059
- Laugh it up, funny man.

42:10.061 --> 42:13.730
- Oh I am, i
am enjoyin' the show.

42:14.999 --> 42:17.300
Especially the show last night.

42:17.302 --> 42:18.768
Let me give you some advice

42:18.770 --> 42:21.137
since you're new to all this.

42:21.139 --> 42:25.074
Next time you wanna
scare someone, use fire.

42:26.777 --> 42:29.979
The thought of their skin
peelin' back and bubblin' up,

42:29.981 --> 42:32.749
ah, it's especially effective.

42:34.818 --> 42:37.020
- You know, I never touched
a woman until last night?

42:37.022 --> 42:39.088
You made me do it, wolf.

42:43.028 --> 42:46.062
- Rita, oh Rita would disagree.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.333
- I never hit her.

42:52.803 --> 42:55.038
- Nah, you never
touched Rita in your life.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.940
No, it was all them other whores

42:56.942 --> 42:59.042
you couldn't keep
your hands off of.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.710
All them other
ladies you've been,

43:00.712 --> 43:02.278
what do your friends call it?

43:02.280 --> 43:03.947
Stabbin'.

43:03.949 --> 43:07.183
- It doesn't matter,
I'm gonna fix it.

43:08.018 --> 43:09.352
- Well now i guess I shore hope

43:09.354 --> 43:10.954
you do get off this mountain

43:10.956 --> 43:12.989
because it would
be a sight to see.

43:12.991 --> 43:16.059
You crawlin' back on
your little worm belly

43:16.061 --> 43:18.094
oh, beggin' forgiveness.

43:18.096 --> 43:22.332
Please, baby, please, I swear
it was a moment of weakness.

43:23.334 --> 43:26.102
- Well what about you, huh?

43:26.104 --> 43:27.870
Kidnapping some
innocent Mexican girl

43:27.872 --> 43:29.238
and throwing her on
top of a mountain.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.241
That isn't too
gentlemanly, wolf.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.078
- Touche.

43:36.146 --> 43:36.145
But let's not forget

43:36.147 --> 43:40.116
that this whole exercise
we're doin' out here

43:40.118 --> 43:42.318
is about you growin'.

43:42.320 --> 43:45.888
- I still think it's a ransom.

43:45.890 --> 43:45.888
I think my dad is paying you off

43:45.890 --> 43:51.761
and any day now, a helicopter
is going to land and save me.

43:51.763 --> 43:53.763
- Is that so?

43:53.765 --> 43:57.000
Why you out here
loppin' up trees

43:57.002 --> 44:00.136
not a lot definitive 'bout
what you're doin' out here.

44:00.138 --> 44:01.404
I spent so much time
choppin' up wood

44:01.406 --> 44:04.173
so you could stay warm.

44:04.175 --> 44:07.410
- I need to be ready
for my trip back home.

44:07.412 --> 44:09.178
- Well if that's the case,

44:09.180 --> 44:11.414
I got a proper pair
of boots for ya.

44:14.252 --> 44:17.654
- And I'm sure there's no catch.

44:17.656 --> 44:21.357
- Just a little walk,
'bout a mile or so north.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.426
I left 'em near a cabin.

44:24.728 --> 44:27.230
- Oh I think I'll
stay right here.

44:27.232 --> 44:29.165
- Bon chance.

44:58.962 --> 45:00.263
- What's all this?

45:08.105 --> 45:10.339
Expedient snow shoes?

45:10.341 --> 45:11.341
- Mm-hmm.

45:13.410 --> 45:15.445
- Let's do it.
- Just do it.

45:15.447 --> 45:16.412
Okay here, no, no, no, no.

45:16.414 --> 45:17.380
Let me...
- no, we just.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.449
Just give me one second.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.987
It's just that you have
to do a double knot here.

45:24.989 --> 45:26.723
- Yeah, well there's a
way of doing a double knot

45:26.725 --> 45:28.758
and that's just silly.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.793
- This is another knot.

45:30.795 --> 45:33.096
- Fine, it's a double knot.

45:42.973 --> 45:45.508
- Hey, so about last night I'm...

45:47.044 --> 45:49.045
- let's try them, okay?

45:51.215 --> 45:52.315
Come on.

46:15.105 --> 46:16.239
- Oh, oh, oh.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.149
Come here.

47:04.955 --> 47:05.955
Come here!

47:17.301 --> 47:20.903
- What is the matter with you?

47:23.440 --> 47:26.375
That was completely unnecessary.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.451
- I'll take the bait.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.373
- I
really don't think...

47:57.375 --> 47:59.108
- you don't think what?

48:04.448 --> 48:06.482
All right, I see
that's the place.

48:06.484 --> 48:08.117
- This doesn't feel right.

48:08.119 --> 48:10.119
- Of course it doesn't.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.288
- Please don't go in there.

48:12.290 --> 48:14.323
- Look, I didn't walk
all the way out here

48:14.325 --> 48:16.259
just for the fun
of it, all right?

48:16.261 --> 48:18.261
Just stay down.

48:18.263 --> 48:19.395
- Listen to me.

48:20.898 --> 48:21.564
- What?

48:21.566 --> 48:22.566
What?

48:27.204 --> 48:28.504
Keep a lookout.

50:45.409 --> 50:46.542
- You won't get far.

50:46.544 --> 50:46.542
- I'm not staying here.

50:46.544 --> 50:49.612
- I told you it was a
bad idea to go there

50:49.614 --> 50:52.081
and I'm telling you it's
a bad idea to leave now.

50:52.083 --> 50:54.250
- Look, he can't track us
in the dark, all right?

50:54.252 --> 50:56.085
That gives us the
advantage, okay?

50:56.087 --> 50:57.520
Gives us a head start.

50:57.522 --> 50:57.520
- I don't wanna go.

50:57.522 --> 51:03.325
- Okay, I don't wanna end up
like those guys in the cabin.

51:06.631 --> 51:09.732
You have to tell me
how to make a fire.

51:14.604 --> 51:15.704
Please.

51:19.543 --> 51:20.810
- What's with the watch?

51:20.812 --> 51:23.145
- Viviana, if i
can't make a fire,

51:23.147 --> 51:24.613
then I'm going to
freeze to death.

51:24.615 --> 51:26.515
- You will anyway.

51:26.517 --> 51:28.517
You're leaving at night.

51:28.519 --> 51:30.186
This is so stupid.

51:30.188 --> 51:33.255
- No, staying here,
that is stupid.

51:33.257 --> 51:35.558
- Leaving at night,
that's worse.

51:39.463 --> 51:42.131
- Tell me how to make a fire.

51:42.133 --> 51:43.833
- Tell me about the watch.

51:43.835 --> 51:46.602
- I don't have time for games.

51:50.307 --> 51:51.307
God!

51:55.413 --> 51:56.413
Why you?

52:00.585 --> 52:03.252
The watch was a present
from my old man all right?

52:03.254 --> 52:06.122
When I got my first job, but
i got fired soon afterwards

52:06.124 --> 52:09.358
so he let me keep
it to remind myself.

52:10.460 --> 52:12.628
- As a reminder of what?

52:12.630 --> 52:13.863
- Of the time.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.632
Jesus are you stupid?

52:23.206 --> 52:27.576
As a reminder that
i screw up everything.

52:36.853 --> 52:39.722
- You have a battery
in your lantern.

52:39.724 --> 52:40.724
- Yeah.

52:41.892 --> 52:44.460
- I'll give you some of this.

52:44.462 --> 52:45.828
- Steel wool?

52:45.830 --> 52:46.830
- Yeah.

52:47.697 --> 52:48.697
You rub them together.

52:51.669 --> 52:55.704
- That's cool.

53:02.679 --> 53:04.747
- Good luck.

53:04.749 --> 53:05.749
- Thanks.

54:33.637 --> 54:34.637
Come on!

54:41.311 --> 54:42.311
Oh god, no.

55:00.730 --> 55:01.830
Oh god.

55:56.519 --> 55:58.420
I'm sorry, god, for...

56:01.691 --> 56:02.691
Everything.

56:05.962 --> 56:08.731
I'm sorry, dad, for being a...

56:10.734 --> 56:11.834
A terrible son.

56:30.387 --> 56:31.687
I'm sorry Rita.

56:35.392 --> 56:36.392
I'm sorry.

56:46.536 --> 56:47.536
Screw it.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.073
Come on.

57:58.908 --> 57:59.975
Viviana!

58:01.010 --> 58:02.010
Viviana!

58:02.948 --> 58:03.847
Help!

58:03.848 --> 58:05.948
- Oh my god, Lester,
are you okay?

58:05.950 --> 58:06.915
- Oh god, it hurts.

58:06.917 --> 58:08.750
- What hurts?

58:08.752 --> 58:11.820
Oh!

58:12.922 --> 58:16.158
- Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

58:18.529 --> 58:20.863
I'm freezing, I'm freezing.

58:24.902 --> 58:26.101
I'm no use.

58:29.072 --> 58:30.138
- It's okay.

58:31.941 --> 58:32.941
Oh my god.
- No, don't

58:32.943 --> 58:33.742
touch.
- I'm sorry!

58:33.744 --> 58:34.910
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

58:34.912 --> 58:36.078
I'm so sorry.

58:41.918 --> 58:44.653
- Don't, don't
touch it, all right?

58:44.655 --> 58:45.721
- I'm sorry.

59:00.537 --> 59:03.872
Is an idiot.

59:06.042 --> 59:08.744
- I have no idea what you said,

59:08.746 --> 59:11.179
but I'm sure that I deserve it.

59:27.130 --> 59:29.665
All right, you son of a bitch.

59:29.667 --> 59:32.167
- Busy night?

59:32.169 --> 59:34.570
- I've learned my lesson.

59:34.572 --> 59:37.172
- Well mother nature's
a tough bitch sometimes.

59:37.174 --> 59:40.108
You gotta watch out for her.

59:40.110 --> 59:42.177
- Why didn't you shoot me?

59:42.179 --> 59:44.012
- It takes a
big man to crawl a mile

59:44.014 --> 59:46.782
on the snow with
a hole in his leg.

59:46.784 --> 59:48.850
Seriously, that's tough.

59:49.919 --> 59:52.287
How's it treatin' ya?

59:52.289 --> 59:55.023
- I'm going to strangle you.

59:55.025 --> 59:57.859
- You got there.

59:57.861 --> 01:00:00.662
Now I remember once on a huntin'
trip, I busted my ankle...

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:03.265
- I'm going to enjoy
the look on your face

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.968
when they shove that
needle in your arm.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.338
I'm gonna sit back
with the biggest smile.

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:13.041
- I remember
once on a huntin' trip,

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:13.041
I busted my ankle now.

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:17.079
I was a long shot off in the
woods with no one around...

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:19.114
- stop with the anecdotes!

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.160
Wolf, I'm sorry.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:41.169
- How is your supplies doin'?

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.839
- I don't know, why?

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:47.376
- Well, you shouldn't
be worried about threats,

01:00:47.378 --> 01:00:51.380
and much more about a
certain combination lock.

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.249
- Combination?

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:04.760
- There's a safe in the closet.

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:09.131
- And you never
look how to open it?

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.174
Where do you want me to start?

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:21.343
- I don't care.

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:25.947
- Okay.

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.417
I'll start outside.

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:18.333
- Viviana!

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:21.970
- Did you find it?

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:24.272
- No, Viviana, get back inside!

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:25.240
- What?

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:27.008
- Just get back inside!

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.777
Please, now!

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:32.347
Come on!

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:33.782
- I'm coming.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.984
- Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:36.986
- What happened?

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:41.757
- Nothing, I just i
had a bad feeling.

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.292
What?

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:47.262
- I had a bad feeling
yesterday and you walked off.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.430
- Really, really?

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:51.800
That's the productive
thing to say?

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:54.002
- I was trying to help.

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:57.239
- Well, okay then, excuse me.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.975
I'm Viviana, I'm
so smart and strong

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:01.943
and I can handle wolf
by myself, that's fine.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:05.013
- I was still looking
for the combo.

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:13.288
- Yep, nice and sturdy,
just how I like ya.

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:26.035
Viviana!

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:28.537
Oh Viviana.

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:32.374
Look what I got.

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:35.443
Oh no, what am i
gonna do with this?

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:43.218
Fine.

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:56.464
Guess who found the combination?

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:10.312
Oh, come on.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:19.354
Oh yes.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.456
Oh my god.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.192
Oh.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.194
Oh Jesus.

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.129
Mmm.

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:37.873
Thank you wolf.

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:48.383
- We should have
opened this sooner.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:49.484
- Oh yeah.

01:04:58.427 --> 01:04:59.427
Ouch.

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:05.300
- You need to take
off your pants.

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:06.302
- No.

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.537
- How am I supposed
to put the bandage on?

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:11.373
- Just put it on top.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.511
Ow, be careful.

01:05:16.513 --> 01:05:18.446
- I'm trying.

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:36.097
- Ah, it hurts!
- Shut up!

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.265
- What?

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.466
- You hear that?

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:44.072
Do you hear that?

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:45.074
- No way.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.042
- Yeah!

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:48.044
- I was right.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.447
- I don't see anything.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:53.415
- Hey!

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:54.950
- Where is it?
- Hey!

01:05:56.653 --> 01:05:59.454
Help!

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:15.403
Wolf!

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:18.673
Wolf!

01:06:24.047 --> 01:06:27.449
Okay, you said he
gave you things.

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:30.018
- He left instructions for me.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.486
- Did you meet him?

01:06:32.984 --> 01:06:34.423
If we're gonna beat him,

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:36.524
we have to do it
at his own game.

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:38.660
- He's a very dangerous man.

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:40.328
- He's a dangerous man?

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.530
Get out of town, no kidding.

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:47.202
- Would you stop doing that?

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:48.103
- Doing what?

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:49.637
- Talking like that.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:53.575
- All right, all right,
all right, all right.

01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:55.010
Okay.

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:57.012
- He thinks that what
he's doing is right.

01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:58.780
- Yeah, well not
dying is right for me,

01:06:58.782 --> 01:07:00.515
so I'm gonna do that.

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:18.400
- I woke up in a snow cave.

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:21.302
- Okay.

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.472
- That's our exit.

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:26.641
We need to leave now,
we'll make a snow shelter.

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:29.411
- Okay.

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:30.678
Okay, who built your snow cave?

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.113
- He did.

01:07:32.115 --> 01:07:34.482
- Oh, and how are we
supposed to build it?

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:35.417
- We have the manual.

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:37.285
- Okay, we have the manual.

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:39.454
All right, now all we
need is 100 marines,

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:42.724
a pickax, some shovels, a
bulldozer would be nice.

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.559
Okay, look, he's
trained, we're not.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.494
That manual, it might
as well be in Chinese.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:49.431
- It doesn't matter, i
survived there for two nights.

01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:51.633
I know we can do this.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:54.369
- Look, I tried this
once before, okay?

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:54.369
Look what happened.

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:58.606
I almost died and this time,
we might not be so lucky.

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:01.509
- You left by yourself
and you left at night.

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:03.745
This time we're leaving
together and it's daytime.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:06.147
We can walk as far as we can
and then we'll find a place

01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:07.649
to build a snow cave.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:11.820
- How am I supposed to trudge
in knee-deep snow with this?

01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:14.255
- I'm gonna help you.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.191
You have to listen
to me, Lester.

01:08:16.193 --> 01:08:17.625
This is our only chance.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:20.161
For the first time, we're
gonna be one step ahead of him.

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:23.465
You said it before, we have
to beat him at his own game.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:23.465
This is it, Lester.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:26.501
If someone's in fact
looking for you,

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:28.670
he won't let them save you.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.638
He will kill you.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.209
And now that the weather is
changing, we'll have a chance.

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:36.711
He won't be able to track us.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:39.714
- Just give me a minute.

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:54.496
Okay.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.299
How do you want to do this?

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.301
- Together.

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:17.412
I though white people
go camping all the time.

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:18.414
Don't you?

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:19.914
- Racist.

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:36.698
Here you go.

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:46.541
All right, it says that we need
to criss-cross the branches

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:47.675
for the roof.

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:51.512
All right.

01:10:51.514 --> 01:10:52.814
- And then we need younger ones.

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:54.949
- More?
- Yeah, and make them longer.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:54.949
- Longer? Okay.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:57.685
- So they go from one
side to the other.

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:59.487
- All right, all right.

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:34.949
- Hey.

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:42.057
You can't.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:55.937
Tell me about her.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.841
Lester?

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:01.142
- Hmm?

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.779
- You have a girlfriend.

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:08.883
- Yeah.

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:17.058
- Is she pretty?

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.861
- She's gorgeous.

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:28.870
- Does she take
good care of you?

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:32.974
- Yeah, she does.

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:44.419
- She's a lucky girl.

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:49.891
- I wouldn't say so.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.546
Viviana!

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:12.548
Viviana!

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.115
Viviana wake up!

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.216
The fire's almost out!

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:16.851
- What?

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:17.985
- It's almost dead.

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:20.488
- Light the sticks.

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:26.861
- They won't light, they
won't light, they're too cold.

01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:28.830
I need your steel wool.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:33.601
- We used mine
last, where's yours?

01:14:33.603 --> 01:14:34.603
- Oh no.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.672
I left it at the cabin.

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:38.674
Oh sh...

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.219
- What does it say?

01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:53.054
No, what are you doing?

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:54.188
- Look, we have no choice,

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:56.057
all right?
- Yeah, we need it!

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:57.525
- We need a fire.

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.505
- Is it working?

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:18.179
- There we go.

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:23.150
There we go, it's
catchin', it's catching.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.118
- Do you hear that?

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:50.798
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.434
Our tracks, our tracks
he's spot our tracks.

01:17:53.436 --> 01:17:54.669
Okay we need to split up.

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:55.302
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:57.071
Go.

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:05.206
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:06.307
- Lester!

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:09.110
- Look.

01:19:09.112 --> 01:19:10.478
- Oh, okay, come on.

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:26.854
- Viviana, hey,
we gotta Viviana?

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:30.558
Viviana?

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.892
Wake up.

01:20:31.894 --> 01:20:33.194
Viviana please.

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:35.029
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:37.464
Please Viviana, wake up.

01:20:37.466 --> 01:20:38.466
Viviana!

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:40.568
Viviana wake up!

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:43.571
No, no please.

01:20:43.573 --> 01:20:45.039
Please, I don't know what to do.

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:47.274
Please tell me what to do.

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:52.413
Viviana, please don't, please
don't, please don't go.

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:54.548
Please don't go.

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:58.152
Please I don't know what to do.

01:20:58.154 --> 01:21:00.421
I don't know what to do,
please tell me what to do.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:02.489
Please.

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:06.260
Please, I don't
want to be alone.

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:09.096
Please don't leave
me here alone.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.120
Oh, boy.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.623
Oh, no I was only 16.

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:55.262
And my dad comes
up to me and says,

01:23:56.531 --> 01:24:00.501
"i worked to build my
company so you need to learn"

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:02.469
"how to do the same."

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:06.707
So he made me get a job.

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:11.512
And I looked and i
looked and I looked

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:14.615
and all I could find was

01:24:17.319 --> 01:24:19.553
that stupid hot dog joint.

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:24.058
With the hats, you know?

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.526
Oh, those stupid,

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.362
stupid hot dog hats.

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:34.635
And that's where I got a job.

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:36.437
Oh.

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:42.076
I was so mad at him about it.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:46.680
You know, wasting my time
wearing a wiener hat.

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:52.486
Like that was supposed to
teach me to be a business man.

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:56.757
And dad's all telling
me about how I need

01:24:56.759 --> 01:25:00.160
to start from the bottom
and work my way up

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:04.364
and how tough he had it
when he started his company.

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:06.767
So what I did...

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:11.438
There was this uh,
there was this girl

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.108
who worked at the earring shop.

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:19.246
So I started flirting with her,
this cute little thing, too.

01:25:22.817 --> 01:25:25.786
And I got her to
give me a piercing

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:28.655
for free.

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:33.594
Just to get
back at him, you know?

01:25:33.596 --> 01:25:36.797
So I come home with
this thing in my ear

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:40.300
and he's all, "what
the hell is that?"

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:42.202
And I go dad, I'm gay!

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:51.712
God, you shouldda seen him.

01:25:51.714 --> 01:25:54.548
Oh god.

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:57.751
He was so pissed,
he was so pissed.

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:01.455
Oh, he took away my car

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:04.558
and my phone

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.795
and I'm all like dad, how am
i supposed to get to work now?

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:12.866
Oh, god.

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:18.739
Pretending I'm gay just
to get to him, you know?

01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:20.908
So of course I got fired.

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:24.711
I only worked there a week.

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:29.483
And I didn't get a job
until after college.

01:26:34.623 --> 01:26:36.190
I wouldn't even have gotten in

01:26:36.192 --> 01:26:39.526
if it wasn't for the
strings he pulled.

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:46.633
Now I'm workin' for him.

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:51.838
Ah.

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:54.708
Man.

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:04.318
Maybe it wasn't
worth it, you know?

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:08.855
Maybe it' wasn't.

01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:20.734
Oh god.

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:23.637
Ah sh...

01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:26.240
Oh

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:29.810
Ow.

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:41.521
Dad, please help me!

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:47.661
Please help me!

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:52.799
I want to go home.

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:58.705
I want to go home.

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:26.933
I wanna go home.

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.003
I want to go home.

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.676
I'm still alive wolf.

01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:45.645
I'm still here.

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:48.915
- Les.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.886
She did a number on my
ribs, I'll tell you what.

01:29:54.823 --> 01:29:57.023
Breathin' gettin' hard.

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:00.560
- Did you hear me?

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:06.633
- You know about
Theodore Roosevelt?

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:08.034
- I'm listening.

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:13.874
- 26th president of
these United States.

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:17.010
He carved the canal at Panama.

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:19.546
Charged San Juan hill.

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:21.014
He was a man's man.

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:25.051
You know what he said, les?

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.053
He said if it weren't
for the time he spent

01:30:27.055 --> 01:30:29.122
in the wilderness,

01:30:29.124 --> 01:30:33.927
he'd never had the courage
to become president.

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:37.431
And mother nature
couldn't even kill him.

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:41.902
It was said death had
to take him sleepin',

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:45.806
'cause otherwise he
wouldda put up a fight.

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:56.116
- And what's this
supposed to teach me?

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.886
- You remind me of 'im.

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:05.091
It seems mother nature ain't
gonna kill you, neither.

01:31:05.093 --> 01:31:07.594
You crawled back twice now.

01:31:08.696 --> 01:31:12.933
That's more than most
folks would ever do.

01:31:12.935 --> 01:31:16.536
I figure it's best
time I come around,

01:31:16.538 --> 01:31:18.071
stop in for a visit.

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:24.845
- Is that supposed
to scare me, wolf?

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:28.181
- Why's you fightin' so hard

01:31:28.183 --> 01:31:30.617
for such a miserable life?

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:47.734
- Because I just
started living it.

01:33:04.011 --> 01:33:07.047
- Well Lester,
you can ambush me.

01:36:04.825 --> 01:36:07.360
Now Lester, I thought after
all you'd been through,

01:36:07.362 --> 01:36:09.929
you'd put up more of a fight.

01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:11.965
What a disappointment.

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:54.107
Runnin' ain't gonna
save you, boy!
