<i>NARRATOR". When last seen,
the Dynamic Duo was trapped...</i>

00:14.432 --> 00:18.228
<i>...in a large vaporizing pipe
in Mr. Freeze's frosty hideout...</i>

00:18.436 --> 00:20.730
<i>...beneath the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena.</i>

00:21.189 --> 00:24.901
<i>With his hand on the controls,
Mr. Freeze was in the process...</i>

00:25.109 --> 00:26.903
<i>...of lowering their temperature...</i>

00:27.111 --> 00:31.074
...and <i>then vaporizing them
into the Bruce Wayne Ice Rink above.</i>

00:31.908 --> 00:33.034
<i>Did he?</i>

00:33.243 --> 00:34.410
<i>Has he?</i>

00:34.619 --> 00:35.787
<i>Will he?</i>

00:36.329 --> 00:39.415
<i>In one chilling moment we'll find out.</i>

01:56.159 --> 01:58.745
As soon as that tube
is completely frost-covered...

01:58.953 --> 02:02.540
...which will mean that the Caped Crackpots
are ready and chilling...

02:03.082 --> 02:06.294
...then I will activate
this vaporizing pipe pump...

02:06.502 --> 02:11.758
...and Batman and Robin will be
a permanent part of the ice rink upstairs!

02:12.050 --> 02:13.718
And it won't be long now.

02:14.552 --> 02:17.555
Gosh, Batman, I've heard of people
freezing to death...

02:17.764 --> 02:20.892
...in places like Siberia,
but not in the heart of Gotham City.

02:21.476 --> 02:23.811
Keep working on that
reverse thermal Bat Lozenge...

02:24.020 --> 02:26.522
...I gave you, Robin,
it might do some good.

02:27.065 --> 02:28.566
Will it keep me from vaporizing?

02:29.108 --> 02:30.276
I doubt it.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.196
What a ghastly way to go.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.156
How long will it take?

02:35.615 --> 02:38.660
Under the right conditions,
and with the right temperature...

02:38.826 --> 02:44.165
...even solid matter, the human body
can be vaporized in a split second.

02:46.376 --> 02:49.921
That's not very long. Batman,
I feel like I'm evaporating right now!

02:50.088 --> 02:52.882
As far as Mr. Freeze is concerned, you are.

02:54.634 --> 02:58.388
Well, the tube
is completely frost covered, so...

02:59.013 --> 03:02.684
- Darling...
-This is no time to get cold feet, Glacia.

03:02.892 --> 03:05.520
The countdown's over, time for blast-off!

03:12.402 --> 03:13.444
Ah.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.615
They're gone.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.534
Of course they're gone.

03:19.951 --> 03:21.953
And all the frosting
in the tube with them!

03:22.578 --> 03:27.041
One moment Masked Meddlers,
the next moment Cold Crepes!

03:27.333 --> 03:31.963
Pumped like any other freezing mixture
right into the ice rink upstairs!

03:32.171 --> 03:35.883
Speaking of ice, boss,
what about their Professor lsaacson?

03:37.385 --> 03:39.721
Take him out of the Quick Freezer
once again, Boys.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.849
Let's see if we're making
headway in that department.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.233
Well, professor.

03:52.442 --> 03:55.027
I'm sure your native Iceland
seldom has a temperature...

03:55.236 --> 03:57.238
...as low as that in my Quick Freezer.

03:57.447 --> 03:58.489
What's the temperature?

03:58.698 --> 04:01.909
- Two hundred degrees below zero.
-Two hundred degrees below zero.

04:02.118 --> 04:04.162
I admit it was cool.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.665
You think you could remember a little more
of your secret formula now?

04:07.999 --> 04:13.004
I don't know, I-- I think you've frozen
my memory, as well as me.

04:14.547 --> 04:19.218
Well, then perhaps another injection
of dry ice might help?

04:19.427 --> 04:23.765
Not that again, please, please, please.
I'll-- I'll try.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.975
<i>- I'll</i> try.
- All right, come on.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.116
They're double-crossers, all of them.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.160
Bruce Wayne, Batman, Robin.

04:44.368 --> 04:48.372
I wouldn't blame Mr. Wayne, darling,
I'm sure he's a man of his word.

04:48.581 --> 04:53.669
- When I met him earlier tonight--
-You met him earlier? Where?

04:54.378 --> 04:56.798
He came backstage before the performance.

04:57.882 --> 05:01.636
- Alone?
-No, he had Mrs. Harriet Cooper with him.

05:01.803 --> 05:05.139
A charming lady.
If only she hadn't picked up my...

05:05.807 --> 05:09.060
Picked up what, Glacia?
Picked up what?

05:10.061 --> 05:11.103
My compact.

05:12.647 --> 05:16.776
So that's what was happening
when all the time I thought this was broken!

05:16.943 --> 05:18.861
You know what you've done, don't you?

05:19.529 --> 05:20.947
I didn't do anything.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.449
I said it was a little music box.

05:23.658 --> 05:27.620
Some music box, it sang a song
of underground hideouts...

05:27.829 --> 05:29.413
...beneath ice skating rinks.

05:30.164 --> 05:34.210
Bruce Wayne is no idiot, I'm sure
he's worked out some clever scheme...

05:34.418 --> 05:39.006
...so that Batman and Robin can bring
the professor back without paying any ransom.

05:39.215 --> 05:41.342
- Well, it didn't work.
-No.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.972
But if Bruce Wayne knows where I am,
so does the police.

05:46.389 --> 05:51.519
- And if the departed duo don't return--
-Well, I told you not to vaporize them.

05:51.727 --> 05:54.355
There's plenty of ice in the
ice rink already.

05:54.564 --> 06:00.361
Yes, there's plenty, and far safer
ice floating in Gotham Harbor!

06:01.320 --> 06:02.905
Frosty, Chillbrain!

06:03.990 --> 06:05.908
Take the professor back to the ice wagon.

06:06.826 --> 06:11.414
We are going in the ice sub
to the hideout in Gotham Harbor.

06:12.582 --> 06:16.127
Where I'll demand a far greater ransom
from the professor...

06:16.544 --> 06:19.171
...or else I'll destroy
all of Gotham City!

06:19.380 --> 06:22.300
What about Asoulda? You know your
seal, she's never come back.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.887
We'll just have to sacrifice Asoulda.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.764
Just another expendable seal.
Take him.

06:31.893 --> 06:33.519
- Come on, Glacia.
-But, darling...

06:34.353 --> 06:38.065
...what about the ice revue
and my famous Waltzing arabesque?

06:38.816 --> 06:45.281
Glacia, take your choice.
Your career or me.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.451
I have no choice, darling.

06:56.959 --> 07:00.671
<i>NARRATOR". But what's this?
Something stirring in the seal house...</i>

07:00.880 --> 07:05.051
<i>...when we know Asoulda's in a bathtub
at Police Headquarters?</i>

07:05.259 --> 07:07.845
<i>The es-Caped Crusaders?</i>

07:08.054 --> 07:09.931
<i>It's a cold fact all right.</i>

07:10.139 --> 07:11.265
Holy escape hatch.

07:11.474 --> 07:14.060
Yes, Robin, most refrigeration systems
as large as this one...

07:14.226 --> 07:17.313
...in the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena
have emergency exits.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.483
It's lucky you remembered the one
behind that vaporizing tube when you did.

07:20.650 --> 07:25.071
You're seldom wrong, old chum,
but a split second is longer than you realize.

07:25.363 --> 07:28.491
Long enough for Mr. Freeze
so that he split too, I see.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.952
Not without taking
Professor lsaacson with him...

07:31.160 --> 07:34.747
...and his frosty confederates
and Emma Strunk.

07:35.081 --> 07:37.416
- You mean, Glacia Glaze?
-No, Robin, Emma Strunk.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.460
No, you mean Glacia Glaze.

07:40.503 --> 07:44.298
No, Emma Strunk. Glacia Glaze
is far too charming a pseudonym...

07:44.507 --> 07:46.342
...for one of her chilling corruption.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.929
- To the Bat Cave?
-And up the Bat Poles.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.180
The Bat Poles?

07:51.347 --> 07:54.058
Even crime fighters need their sleep, Robin.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.227
While those crooks just stay away from us?

07:56.435 --> 07:59.855
Don't worry, Robin, Mr. Freeze will be
frozen in his tracks...

08:00.064 --> 08:02.274
...before we're through with him. Let's go.

08:05.695 --> 08:09.156
But what's this?
On the dawn of a new day...

08:09.365 --> 08:14.829
<i>...not just one iceberg, but a sea
of icebergs off Gotham City Harbor.</i>

08:17.123 --> 08:19.542
- How we doing, boss?
-Fine, boys.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.128
Our ice magnets
have attracted every iceberg...

08:22.336 --> 08:24.505
...from the South Pole to the Arctic Circle.

08:25.297 --> 08:28.843
Now no one will be able
to tell which is our iceberg.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.514
Now, professor, how are you doing?

08:35.349 --> 08:41.522
I'm done. Here's my secret formula.
As nearly as I can remember it.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.403
How does this work?

08:48.529 --> 08:49.780
How does what work?

08:50.281 --> 08:53.868
- How does this formula work?
-I don't know how it works.

08:54.577 --> 08:59.540
I worked out the formula,
but I never did work out how it works.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.294
You...

09:05.421 --> 09:07.256
Darling.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.719
Aren't you being a little rough
on poor Professor lsaacson?

09:11.969 --> 09:16.140
Poor Professor lsaacson will become
rich Professor lsaacson, Glacia.

09:16.390 --> 09:21.729
If we can put his secret formula to use
for our own gains, we'll all be rich.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.106
The world will be yours, Glacia.

09:24.356 --> 09:28.360
- Mine.
-Of course, don't you see the potential?

09:28.903 --> 09:32.323
The Kremlin will be
a cold water flat in a second.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.658
The White House an icebox.

09:34.950 --> 09:39.288
We would control everything
from cold cream to cold wars...

09:39.872 --> 09:44.627
...and all the lovely ice in the world
will sparkle on your fingers...

09:45.002 --> 09:50.132
...and dangle from your ears.
-You mean ice like in diamonds, darling?

09:50.466 --> 09:53.803
No, Glacia, I mean ice like in icing.

09:54.178 --> 09:57.723
That secret formula will be
the frosting on the cake...

09:58.182 --> 10:03.062
...and the cake will be the universe.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.023
Well, then, professor...

10:07.525 --> 10:09.443
Go, Glacia, go.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.118
Yes, Governor Stonefellow?

10:19.411 --> 10:20.871
Yes, Governor Stonefellow?

10:23.791 --> 10:25.960
Yes, Governor Stonefellow.

10:28.879 --> 10:33.425
- A little problem, commissioner?
-A little problem? Ha!

10:34.969 --> 10:38.889
Everything that has happened before,
Chief O'Hara...

10:39.682 --> 10:42.226
...everything that happened
yesterday, last night.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.562
The near disaster to the Gotham Queen.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.856
The apparent kidnapping of Glacia Glaze.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.984
The astounding buildup of icebergs
outside Gotham Harbor.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.529
Even the strange disappearance
of the Caped Crusaders themselves.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.657
- Ha, ha. Insignificant, trivial, paltry.
-It is?

10:56.866 --> 10:58.993
- Peanuts, popcorn, a pinch of snuff.
-It is?

10:59.201 --> 11:01.620
Child's play, a brass farthing.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.122
Uh, it is, commissioner?

11:03.330 --> 11:06.250
Compared to the word just received
from the nation's capital.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.336
The Chief Executive was just beginning
an address...

11:09.545 --> 11:12.006
...to Congress. When he looked
at his teleprompter...

11:12.214 --> 11:13.507
...what do you think he saw?

11:14.175 --> 11:15.885
- His speech.
-No.

11:16.302 --> 11:21.182
In some diabolical way, perhaps a
thermodynamic ice ray beam of some kind...

11:21.390 --> 11:24.852
...his speech on the teleprompter
had become frozen.

11:25.227 --> 11:28.606
And in its place was a message
from Mr. Freeze.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.774
Bless me suspender buttons.

11:30.983 --> 11:34.195
Saying that this city,
this state, this country...

11:34.987 --> 11:37.823
...would be returned to the Ice Age
in a matter of moments...

11:38.032 --> 11:40.576
Unless we capitulated to all
his demands, at once.

11:40.743 --> 11:43.245
Uh, well, what are his demands?

11:43.454 --> 11:47.166
Oh, that's just it, Chief O'Hara,
he said to prepare ourselves...

11:47.374 --> 11:49.919
...for a little sample of what he had in mind.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.254
And then prepare to pay.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.717
Well, where did they think that this, uh...

11:56.884 --> 12:01.305
...thermodynamic ice gizmo
was being beamed from?

12:01.513 --> 12:04.266
One of the hundreds of icebergs
now lying off Gotham Harbor.

12:04.475 --> 12:07.144
Well, what about the Coast Guard,
the-- The Ice Patrol?

12:07.353 --> 12:08.562
Understaffed, overworked.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.482
There must be some solution.

12:12.524 --> 12:17.029
The solution, as always, rests in hands
other than ours, Chief O'Hara.

12:18.364 --> 12:23.077
Oh, Batman, wherefore art thou?

12:27.581 --> 12:30.751
Whereforever he are,
commissioner, he heard you.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.002
Yes!

12:36.215 --> 12:37.258
Yes, Batman?

12:37.633 --> 12:41.512
I probably should have checked in earlier,
commissioner, but we had a busy night.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.933
- Mr. Freeze escaped us.
-I am aware of that, Batman.

12:46.558 --> 12:50.187
But we'll now use every means
at our command...

12:50.396 --> 12:53.565
...and there are many,
to track him down.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.902
Well, hurry, Batman, hurry,
time now belongs to Mr. Freeze.

12:57.111 --> 12:58.570
It no longer belongs to us.

13:00.906 --> 13:06.745
<i>But so does the Thermodynamic Ice Ray Beam
constructed in his icy Noah's Ark...</i>

13:06.954 --> 13:09.164
<i>...under the direction of Professor lsaacson.</i>

13:09.748 --> 13:12.293
You are a genius
to have made this, professor.

13:13.002 --> 13:15.296
Out of the odds and ends in this iceberg.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.174
Genius, Miss Glaze, is the talent
of a man who is dead.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.593
And the Ice Ray Beam isn't dead.

13:22.052 --> 13:25.806
Now to give Gotham City
a small sample of how it works.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.976
<i>NARRATOR".
And how it works.</i>

13:31.353 --> 13:36.025
<i>Frozen assets, frozen pipes...</i>

13:37.943 --> 13:39.570
<i>...frozen waste.</i>

13:43.157 --> 13:45.367
<i>Even in the Bat</i> Cave.

13:46.410 --> 13:49.121
Holy chill blades, look
at the Batcomputer, Batman.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.290
I am, old chum, I am.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.959
Frozen to its very marrow.

13:54.168 --> 13:57.546
- But how, why?
-No doubt, Mr. Freeze is up to another...

13:57.755 --> 14:00.132
...diabolical thermodynamic experiment--

14:00.341 --> 14:02.593
At the risk of sending cold shivers
down your back, sir...

14:02.760 --> 14:06.263
...Mrs. Cooper has just heard
a most chilling morning broadcast.

14:06.472 --> 14:07.556
Say no more, Alfred.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.102
Yes, Batman?

14:12.311 --> 14:16.065
Arrange a broadcast to
Mr. Freeze, commissioner.

14:16.482 --> 14:20.986
Tell him-- Tell him we await his demands
whatever they are.

14:21.445 --> 14:26.241
In the meantime, is that seal still in the
bathtub in Police Headquarters?

14:26.950 --> 14:29.036
Yeah, flipping merrily away.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.956
Good. Do you have the Seal Bat Signal
I gave you?

14:33.165 --> 14:35.667
The small echoing seal pulsator?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.587
Uh, yes, Batman, it's right here.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.757
Excellent. Attach it to one
of the seal's flippers.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.176
Then release the seal in Gotham Harbor.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.471
No doubt it will home
for Mr. Freeze's iceberg...

14:47.679 --> 14:51.016
...and we'll pick up
its wavelength in the Batcopter.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.518
Right, Batman.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.818
Picked up the seal's pulsator yet, Batman?

15:01.110 --> 15:05.072
We're still over land, Robin,
and a seal is an aquatic marine mammal.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.533
Gosh, yes, Batman, I forgot.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.330
Anything now?

15:14.123 --> 15:17.167
I think I got a slight blip
from the Seal Bat Signal.

15:17.501 --> 15:20.129
Asoulda seems to be heading
through Gotham Narrows.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.259
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, in his refrigerated refuge...</i>

15:25.467 --> 15:28.846
...Mr. <i>Freeze and his frosty flunkies
work out...</i>

15:29.138 --> 15:30.639
Our demands.

15:31.432 --> 15:32.766
Can you think of anything else?

15:33.392 --> 15:37.896
The, the part I like, boss, is that
complete guarantee of immunity.

15:38.480 --> 15:42.234
The part I like is
all that ice like in diamonds.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.737
Fifty million dollars is not
to be sneezed at.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.906
Though of course, I never catch cold.

15:48.449 --> 15:52.786
Aren't you skating on thin ice?
How do you expect payment to be made?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.955
By Batman and Robin, of course.

15:55.622 --> 16:00.252
Frosty, you seem to forget,
the Dynamic Duo are now defunct.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.797
Oh, that's right, part of an ice rink.

16:05.340 --> 16:09.386
I guess we can call them now,
the Vaporized Vanquishers, eh?

16:10.762 --> 16:11.889
Eh, boss?

16:12.347 --> 16:17.811
That's not bad, Frosty.
"Vaporized Vanquishers."

16:19.563 --> 16:20.731
That's not bad.

16:26.737 --> 16:28.238
Now where's the seal, Batman?

16:28.447 --> 16:31.116
Heading to the iceberg
in that floating mass ahead of us.

16:31.325 --> 16:32.743
Take a look.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.787
Holy polar ice sheet.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.541
We'll drop down but I don't think
we can land on it.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.710
You'd better inflate the Bat Pontoons.

16:41.919 --> 16:45.130
Check the compass and advise
Commissioner Gordon of our location.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.800
He and his men may have to come out by
Coast Guard icebreaker.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.093
Ready, old chum?

16:50.427 --> 16:52.137
- You bet.
- Here we go.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.937
What do you mean the Coast Guard
doesn't have an icebreaker?

17:00.270 --> 17:02.105
We've never needed one, commissioner.

17:02.397 --> 17:05.067
With Gotham Harbor completely blocked
by icebergs...

17:05.275 --> 17:07.152
...wouldn't you say we needed one now?

17:07.986 --> 17:11.490
Uh, I don't know where
I could put my finger on one.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.992
Well, put your finger on one,
I don't care where.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.372
What's that?

17:20.082 --> 17:23.001
My parker, commissioner. Here's yours.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.170
That's P-A-R-K-A, Chief O'Hara.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.173
It's a hooded Siberian and Alaskan
outer garment.

17:28.382 --> 17:31.468
Well, I'm no hooded Siberian,
but, how do I look?

17:31.677 --> 17:34.846
In this particular case it isn't
appearance that counts, Chief O'Hara.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.183
And you needn't have put it on
until you get aboard the icebreaker.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.269
If you go aboard the icebreaker.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.646
Just trying it on for size.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.607
Ahem, Bonnie, please call
my daughter Barbara at college...

17:45.816 --> 17:47.568
...ask her to take a later plane.

17:47.818 --> 17:50.487
I wanna meet her of course,
but I have some cool facts...

17:50.696 --> 17:52.531
...to face before I get to the airport.

17:54.241 --> 17:57.160
Uh, okay, Nanook, let's go.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.592
Hey, boss, look who's in here. Asoulda.

18:13.302 --> 18:14.678
Asoulda.

18:16.013 --> 18:18.849
I told you she was a homing seal.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.437
Homing? Homing?

18:23.729 --> 18:25.105
Darling, what's the matter?

18:26.398 --> 18:28.609
This could be some kind of trick.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.573
It is some kind of a trick.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.909
The Batcopter's landed
just outside the iceberg.

18:38.410 --> 18:39.578
The Batcopter?

18:39.786 --> 18:42.914
Yes, Glacia, but please,
don't ask questions which I can't answer.

18:43.707 --> 18:48.003
Frosty. Frosty, Chillbrain,
activate the ice magnets.

18:48.211 --> 18:51.465
We'll pull that Batcopter
right into the iceberg.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.634
Just the way we did the Gotham Queen.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.594
I doubt that, Mr. Freeze.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.308
Salvation.

19:05.771 --> 19:08.148
How did you keep from being vaporized?

19:08.649 --> 19:12.277
How did you land outside the iceberg
and get on it without me seeing you?

19:12.736 --> 19:15.364
How did you find the entrance
to the ice ladders?

19:15.530 --> 19:17.949
Oh, darling, stop spitting ice cubes.

19:19.618 --> 19:23.705
It was really quite simple,
Mr. Freeze, thanks to ingenuity...

19:23.914 --> 19:27.376
...your homing seal, our Ice Batarangs
and our Ice Bat Ropes.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.711
And our Reverse Thermal Bat Lozenges.

19:30.045 --> 19:33.632
So you see, Mr. Freeze,
you're the one who's on ice.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.509
The gun.

19:39.930 --> 19:45.060
Ah-ah. Didn't you learn last night that your
freeze gun has no effect on us?

19:45.435 --> 19:48.939
Not with our super-thermalized
Bat Skivvies under our regular clothes.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.441
Icemen, to the attack.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.951
Put them on ice! Ice!

20:11.169 --> 20:15.173
Put them on ice. No, you fool,
get back into the battle.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.127
Glacia, I'm getting out of here...

20:52.377 --> 20:55.881
...even though normal temperature
may mean my death in spite of my collar.

20:57.132 --> 21:00.761
Maybe not your death, Mr. Freeze,
but at least a good long cooling off period.

21:00.969 --> 21:04.431
In our local Siberia.
Take him away, Officer Sherman.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.977
- Don't touch the dials.
- Darling.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.605
- Her too, Batman?
-I'm afraid so, commissioner.

21:11.813 --> 21:15.984
- Emma Strunk is as guilty as the rest of them.
-Emma Strunk?

21:18.904 --> 21:21.156
I'm Glacia Glaze, Batman.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.868
To the world of the rich and renowned,
such as millionaire Bruce Wayne...

21:25.076 --> 21:26.745
...you may be known as Glacia Glaze.

21:27.204 --> 21:30.791
But to the world of the crime fighter
you're known as Emma Strunk.

21:31.833 --> 21:35.420
Batman, if ever you see Mr. Wayne...

21:36.254 --> 21:39.508
...and he asks about me and Mr. Freeze...

21:39.716 --> 21:42.177
...would you tell him something
Rabelais once said?

21:43.345 --> 21:45.555
Rabelais, of course.

21:46.014 --> 21:49.518
"To each his own, as the woman said
when she kissed her cow."

21:50.268 --> 21:54.815
- All right, all right.
-Well, Batman, you've done it again.

21:55.607 --> 21:59.027
I don't know how to begin to express
Gotham City's thanks.

21:59.361 --> 22:04.449
In this case, Gotham City owes most of its
thanks to a certain homing seal.

22:04.658 --> 22:07.035
- Gosh, yes.
-Asoulda.

22:13.333 --> 22:17.587
In fact, she deserves more than thanks,
she deserves a special reward.

22:17.963 --> 22:19.673
Where'd you get a live fish, Batman?

22:19.881 --> 22:24.010
A true crime fighter always carries
everything he needs in his utility belt, Robin.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.319
Bruce, Christmas sure came early this year.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.488
Yes, it did, Dick, thanks to Aunt Harriet.

22:46.575 --> 22:48.827
I don't know how you
constructed this playroom...

22:49.035 --> 22:52.080
...as a surprise
without us knowing about it, Aunt Harriet.

22:54.332 --> 22:57.460
Or this slot car raceway.
It's the coolest, Aunt Harriet.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.421
Well, Alfred was a big help.

22:59.754 --> 23:03.717
And speaking of cool, Dick, can you
guess what I've named my car?

23:03.967 --> 23:06.469
- What?
-Glacia Glaze.

23:06.928 --> 23:10.140
And I think it's the prettiest car
on the raceway.

23:10.515 --> 23:15.395
That's a good reason, Aunt Harriet.
I've named mine Emma Strunk.

23:15.604 --> 23:20.025
- Emma Strunk.
-For purely personal reasons, Aunt Harriet.

23:20.609 --> 23:24.070
- What about you, Dick?
-I think I'll call mine Asoulda.

23:24.362 --> 23:27.949
How Wagnerian, Dick. Romantic.

23:28.325 --> 23:30.368
Alfred, what did you name your car?

23:30.577 --> 23:32.954
Mine seems to have run
into a bit of trouble, Madam.

23:33.163 --> 23:36.583
So, uh, I think I'll call it Mr. Freeze.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.961
Mercy alive, that terrible man.

23:40.170 --> 23:45.300
When I think of all the trouble he caused
and the problems so many people have.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.636
Like you, Bruce,
with your Wayne Foundation...

23:47.844 --> 23:52.390
...and you, Dick,
with that essay on the glaciers.

23:53.058 --> 23:57.312
My, I'm just so glad that
I thought of this playroom.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.814
And this slot car raceway.

24:00.315 --> 24:05.028
Yes, Aunt Harriet, at least
for a little while we can forget our worries. Ah!

24:05.320 --> 24:06.613
And have some fun.
