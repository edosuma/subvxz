WEBVTT

01:09.612 --> 01:15.576
BEING 17

01:18.412 --> 01:23.334
first trimester

02:05.376 --> 02:09.171
Let's play.
Oscar, you pick the yellow team.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.048
Gregory, the blue team.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.592
Choose your teammates.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.094
Victor.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.846
Hugo.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.347
Thomas.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.223
Cyprien.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.558
Yoann.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.017
Amaury.

02:45.124 --> 02:46.500
Pick one of them.

02:46.792 --> 02:47.334
Thomas.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.131
Damien.

03:04.768 --> 03:08.272
Summer evenings blue
I will roam rustic paths,

03:08.564 --> 03:11.275
pricked by wheat,
crushing thin grass.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.820
Dreaming,
I'll feel its coolness underfoot.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.948
I'll let the breeze
bathe my bare head.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.617
I will not speak.

03:20.284 --> 03:21.911
I'll think of nothing.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.997
But infinite love will rise in me

03:25.414 --> 03:26.665
and I will wander far,

03:26.957 --> 03:28.209
very far,

03:28.751 --> 03:29.668
like a vagabond,

03:30.127 --> 03:32.671
in nature, like a woman's company.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.381
Thank you, Damien.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.800
- Good day?
- Yeah, and you?

04:18.092 --> 04:19.385
Flus. And you?

04:19.677 --> 04:21.011
Rimbaud.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.683
I prefer when it's longer.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.559
- Our mosquito nets came.
- Fancy!

05:09.268 --> 05:11.270
Some soldiers got malaria.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.188
Taking your Nivaquine?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.523
Yes, Doctor!

05:15.357 --> 05:17.735
- Want me to go?
- Yes, please.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.988
Later, son. Love you.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.911
He's making it romantic for us.

05:29.955 --> 05:30.831
New blouse?

05:31.332 --> 05:32.499
Like it?

05:33.167 --> 05:34.626
I'm glad you noticed.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.628
I notice everything.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.589
Coming home for Christmas?

05:38.881 --> 05:43.052
I hear rumors but I don't want
to disappoint you again.

05:43.344 --> 05:47.139
I'll prepare the house for you.
I feel so alone in bed.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.807
Wearing the red bra?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.476
- How do you know?
- I don't.

05:50.768 --> 05:51.894
Just a feeling.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.911
Polo?

06:12.915 --> 06:15.167
Don't jump in all gung-ho.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.420
Protect your face
or it'll get messed up.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.005
That's one thing.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.384
Second, never face on.
Always at an angle.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.637
And you... bear down on your legs.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.181
Third thing... your fingers.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.892
This way, they'll get broken.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.311
Keep them a little curved in.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.437
Get it?

06:35.729 --> 06:38.190
This time bear down on your legs.

06:38.482 --> 06:39.900
Get in position.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.448
Strike.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.660
You're more grounded. Feel it?

06:49.952 --> 06:52.579
Harder, go all out.
Push, push!

06:52.871 --> 06:54.915
Damn, you're wound up!

06:55.207 --> 06:57.209
Grab onto me and knock me over.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.460
Good!

07:01.213 --> 07:02.256
Excellent!

07:03.006 --> 07:06.176
- Don't turn him into a dumb soldier.
- Dumb, no.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.514
I have an emergency in Le Casset.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.558
Don't wait up.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.518
Careful of avalanches.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.937
- I'm a big girl.
- Hope so.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.817
Don't forget to get paid!

07:42.254 --> 07:43.088
Hello.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.673
Dr. Delille?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.426
We'll walk.
The car won't make it.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.766
- Leaving will be hard.
- I'll come turn it around.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.185
Great, thanks.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.075
We put her in here.
It's warmer.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.252
- So what's wrong?
- I feel exhausted.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.670
What else?

08:47.069 --> 08:48.445
Take a deep breath.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.375
A pulmonary infection.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.504
I get nauseous in the morning,
several weeks now.

09:05.796 --> 09:06.672
Morning sickness?

09:06.964 --> 09:10.175
It began a month ago.
Then the fever started.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.888
You can lie back down.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.141
I used Metacam for her fever.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.143
I don't know it.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.771
An anti-inflammatory for animals.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.441
Isn't it okay
if you respect the dose?

09:26.942 --> 09:29.152
Practical, if it's all you have.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.530
Clever but potentially dangerous.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.490
He wants to be a vet.

09:33.782 --> 09:34.866
That's funny.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.952
I grew up in the country.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.914
My parents were farmers.
Grain, not cattle like you.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.044
Are you allergic to penicillin?

09:49.339 --> 09:50.841
You from around here?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.051
No, from the Beauce.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.553
Doctor!

09:56.638 --> 09:57.639
Here.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.684
To thank for having come.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.020
And for letting us pay later.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.563
Thanks, I'm fine.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.106
I'll kill it myself.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.886
It's not too much?

10:36.178 --> 10:37.429
No, he'll like it.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.494
Come here.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.310
Hold on, Damien.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.603
Put this on.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.982
I don't want you sick.

12:12.774 --> 12:13.859
Hello.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.865
- You come by foot?
- By foot and bus.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.285
- How long does it take?
- An hour and a half.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.580
- What dedication!
- I like the mountains.

12:27.289 --> 12:31.209
I'll have your mom's antibiotics today.
I'll call her.

12:31.835 --> 12:32.961
Goodbye.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.134
Minus 2x squared...

12:41.052 --> 12:42.220
plus...

12:43.263 --> 12:44.639
plus 2x...

12:48.435 --> 12:49.770
Minus 12.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.023
All right. And then?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.192
Then...

12:59.362 --> 13:00.822
Can anyone help?

13:04.326 --> 13:06.119
Damien, to the board.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.795
A second-degree equation.

13:18.673 --> 13:22.761
That makes... minus 2x squared

13:23.637 --> 13:25.222
plus 2x

13:26.765 --> 13:30.018
plus 12 equals zero.

13:31.812 --> 13:35.857
Delta equals B squared

13:36.149 --> 13:38.109
minus 4ac.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.615
You're dumber than I thought.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.036
Just two more solutions to find.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.914
Abscissa and intersection points.

13:51.206 --> 13:52.791
And the ordinates.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.584
Take your seat.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.336
Everyone, get working.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.459
What's going on, Damien?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.004
What happened to you?

14:39.296 --> 14:40.255
What did you do?

14:40.547 --> 14:41.965
I fell.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.216
You fell.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.843
Think I buy that?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.305
What about Damien? He did nothing?

14:49.014 --> 14:50.891
You just fell out of the blue?

15:28.511 --> 15:29.679
So?

15:30.972 --> 15:33.558
So nothing. He's not on line.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.518
Hold on...

15:36.186 --> 15:37.354
Come and see.

15:40.815 --> 15:41.858
Ready?

15:42.817 --> 15:44.027
Taste this.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.448
To die for.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.829
- I knew that chicken.
- What?

15:55.914 --> 15:57.374
I saw it die.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.418
That house call at the farm.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.128
Mrs. Chardoul.

16:02.879 --> 16:03.922
Chardoul?

16:04.965 --> 16:06.341
Do you know Thomas?

16:07.592 --> 16:09.052
He's in my grade.

16:09.552 --> 16:12.347
- Paid in poultry now?
- Not my idea.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.601
You have to help the entire world.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.812
What can I say?
It's my job.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.690
Which is why you should get paid.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.820
What's he like?

16:27.529 --> 16:28.697
Who?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.700
That kid in your grade. Thomas.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.369
Always alone.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.123
Left farming school to study science.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.918
- He's adopted.
- I have no idea.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.004
He wants to become a vet.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.007
You seem in the know.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.051
I liked him a lot.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.555
He's handsome.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.978
The girls must like him.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.816
He's not into girls.
Or anyone else.

17:10.447 --> 17:14.492
I'll give you his mom's medicine.
It'll save me a trip.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.001
The way he twisted its neck!

17:24.085 --> 17:25.462
And you laugh.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.088
Yep.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.773
Take note of the empty vials' mass

17:45.065 --> 17:47.692
to calculate the density afterwards.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.169
From my mom.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.254
I mean, the doctor.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.013
Beat it.

19:40.471 --> 19:41.514
Why?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.516
So they don't see me with you.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.642
Damien...

20:26.517 --> 20:27.852
Go for the face

20:28.770 --> 20:31.231
hand flat out, rapid-fire.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.107
Go for the body too.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.285
The body now.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.384
Stop.

20:59.676 --> 21:00.593
Not bad.

21:01.386 --> 21:05.098
Physically you've progressed.
Now work your attitude.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.892
- My attitude?
- You sound all girly.

22:00.570 --> 22:01.779
I got your meds.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.449
Antibiotics and paracetamol.
Feel better?

22:08.911 --> 22:11.581
- Fever's down.
- No, it's the same.

22:17.712 --> 22:18.713
So,

22:19.630 --> 22:21.466
3 times a day for pain.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.720
This is one at noon, one at night.

22:29.057 --> 22:29.849
This too.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.435
She wrote you a letter.

22:33.478 --> 22:36.647
"Christine,
remember your pregnancy test."

22:39.525 --> 22:40.818
Put that away.

23:05.051 --> 23:05.843
See better?

23:09.097 --> 23:11.307
- Can I ask a question?
- Go on.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.684
Did Mom get pregnant before me?

23:13.976 --> 23:15.228
Several times.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.813
But it never lasted.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.648
Or I wouldn't be here.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.525
Yeah, you wouldn't.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.444
Go and see if it works.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.489
And be careful.

24:06.362 --> 24:07.029
Help him.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.698
Help him up.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.411
Guys! Stop it!

24:21.502 --> 24:22.503
Cool it.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.173
Stop it!

24:31.679 --> 24:33.306
It's over now.

24:33.598 --> 24:34.724
Go there.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.519
You, there.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.733
Hello, ma'am.
Have a seat.

24:48.112 --> 24:51.741
As I said,
Thomas and Damien fought during gym.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.410
- It's not the first time.
- How so?

24:55.036 --> 24:57.205
But I hope it's the last.

24:57.497 --> 25:01.000
Or I'll try more severe measures,
like suspension.

25:01.292 --> 25:02.460
For both of you.

25:03.419 --> 25:06.172
Now Thomas,
let me ask you something.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.633
You're slipping scholastically.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.886
Low grades.
Teachers say you're apathetic.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.514
You cut yourself off.
Anything wrong?

25:15.306 --> 25:17.058
And where are you parents?

25:17.350 --> 25:19.393
Thomas' mother is sick.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.772
Take the efforts he makes
into consideration.

25:23.064 --> 25:26.901
2 hours back and forth to school,
farm work at night.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.446
Thomas was offered room and board.
He said no.

25:30.738 --> 25:31.364
Right?

25:32.532 --> 25:33.616
Why?

25:33.908 --> 25:35.451
I like it up there.

25:38.704 --> 25:39.997
What can I say?

25:40.748 --> 25:42.542
Can you step out, Thomas?

25:51.467 --> 25:55.137
Can you tell us
why the two of you fight so often?

25:55.429 --> 25:57.765
- We don't get along.
- I'm sorry.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.560
That's no reason to fight.
There's more.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.688
It's just your mom, me, you.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.524
Speak freely.
Does Thomas bully you?

26:07.358 --> 26:09.819
For you it's obvious who's guilty?

26:10.236 --> 26:14.323
This may be about bullying,
which is much more serious.

26:15.449 --> 26:19.412
It's hypothetical,
but Thomas fits the bully profile.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.956
What's a bully profile for you?

26:22.248 --> 26:22.873
For example

26:23.165 --> 26:25.876
he knocked Damien over
for no reason.

26:26.377 --> 26:28.379
This time I hit first.

26:47.148 --> 26:48.149
Get in.

26:49.650 --> 26:50.901
I said to get in.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.863
Too much snow
to make it up there.

26:54.488 --> 26:55.781
I'll manage.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.074
Get in.

26:57.658 --> 26:58.784
Come on.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.686
I'm coming in to see your mother.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.827
Christine, did you do the test?

27:43.162 --> 27:45.289
- The pregnancy test.
- No need.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.793
If I change antibiotics,
I need to know.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.503
No need, I said.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.299
I won't take the risk.

27:56.217 --> 27:58.386
If I'm pregnant, it's already dead.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.932
I won't leave until you take it.

29:19.717 --> 29:20.593
Down!

29:21.594 --> 29:22.720
Damien!

29:26.182 --> 29:28.976
Why didn't you stay in the car?

29:29.268 --> 29:30.311
Tom!

29:32.688 --> 29:34.982
Promise me you'll stop fighting.

29:36.609 --> 29:37.943
Shake hands.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.447
Go on, shake hands!

29:43.282 --> 29:45.701
Better than that. Shake for real.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.793
I need a word with you.

29:55.669 --> 29:58.339
Your mom will spend
a few days in hospital.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.424
She's pregnant.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.551
Are you sure?

30:03.469 --> 30:04.637
Of course.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.215
Hello, son.

32:05.799 --> 32:07.968
- Good to see you.
- Same here.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.347
You haven't caught up yet.

32:11.639 --> 32:13.307
You'll be taller soon enough.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.018
Safe trip back?

32:16.310 --> 32:18.145
- Glad to be here?
- You bet!

32:24.568 --> 32:27.821
I put a mirror there
to lighten up the room.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.366
It makes it seem bigger.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.702
You went all out on the lights.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.246
- Don't like them?
- I do.

32:37.039 --> 32:37.998
I got nervous!

32:40.793 --> 32:43.379
- Back in an hour.
- Where are you off to?

32:43.796 --> 32:45.255
Workout with Polo.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.257
What is this new obsession?

32:48.384 --> 32:50.511
I want to learn self-defense.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.597
From what I hear, you're...

32:53.889 --> 32:55.391
not bad at offense.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.226
Like you.

32:57.726 --> 33:01.981
My profession has nothing to do
with your little fights.

33:02.272 --> 33:05.859
Disliking someone violently,
irrationally...

33:06.151 --> 33:06.902
I get it.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.488
But not assault and battery.

33:09.780 --> 33:10.948
Explain.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.826
It's over anyway.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.161
Glad to hear you say it.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.418
Stay. We need to talk.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.461
Sit down there.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.674
Tom's mother is in hospital.

33:29.299 --> 33:33.220
I suggested he come stay here
for his schoolwork.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.934
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I am now.

33:39.977 --> 33:41.687
Why are you doing this?

33:41.979 --> 33:45.774
He'll never get by,
with his 3-hour commutes.

33:46.066 --> 33:49.695
He deserves help.
And you said it's over anyway.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.531
He'll never want to come.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.324
- Why not?
- He hates me.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.660
How can anyone not like you?

33:59.121 --> 34:00.372
Hold on.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.082
Let's go for a ride.

34:07.004 --> 34:10.174
- Can you teach me to drive?
- See this snow?

34:10.716 --> 34:12.009
Not today. Next time.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.345
Polo wants to buy your car.

34:15.637 --> 34:16.972
It's not for sale.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.558
Let's go say hi to Polo.

34:20.642 --> 34:21.810
Come on.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.671
Hello, Tom.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.675
I'm Damien's father.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.386
How are you?

35:39.012 --> 35:40.556
- Hello!
- Sir...

35:41.265 --> 35:44.101
- The road wasn't too hard?
- It was okay.

35:44.935 --> 35:46.061
Good.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.940
- Coffee?
- I'd love some.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.660
- Is that a bear?
- Sure is.

36:01.952 --> 36:05.622
You should see the bear
at the Toulouse Museum.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.457
He died two weeks ago.

36:07.749 --> 36:11.545
He probably fell,
though no autopsy results yet.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.005
Want some?

36:14.298 --> 36:15.632
I saw a bear once.

36:16.258 --> 36:19.261
At night during a snowstorm.
You dreamt it!

36:21.013 --> 36:23.682
Study instead of wandering the woods.

36:24.099 --> 36:25.267
Have a seat.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.603
Can you get the honey?

36:27.895 --> 36:30.856
Staying at your place will do him good.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.441
It's only normal.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.444
Tom doesn't seem thrilled.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.279
Why should I live there?

36:37.946 --> 36:40.574
Your own room.
Near school, the hospital.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.659
Conducive to good work.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.832
I want to be here while you're sick.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.710
And I want you to graduate.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.672
You dislike my son but...

36:55.964 --> 36:57.341
I don't care about him.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.092
Watch your mouth!

36:59.760 --> 37:01.053
He's here to help.

37:01.345 --> 37:02.721
I don't need help.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.351
Believe it or not, I do.

37:07.643 --> 37:09.269
Can you give me a hand?

37:10.604 --> 37:13.774
- Pilot in the Air Force?
- No, the Army.

37:14.608 --> 37:17.444
80% of helicopter pilots
are in the Army.

37:19.529 --> 37:20.948
Why choose that?

37:21.823 --> 37:23.575
At 17, I knew I'd fly.

37:24.701 --> 37:25.953
It was a no-brainer.

37:26.453 --> 37:27.788
Fighter pilot?

37:28.080 --> 37:30.332
I wasn't into the fighter part.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.835
But airline pilot
was too humdrum for me.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.382
I needed adventure.
I chose officer training school.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.426
- So the Army.
- Yeah...

37:47.557 --> 37:51.895
If I flunk, I'll join the Foreign Legion.
See the world.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.147
What about veterinarian?

37:55.732 --> 37:58.402
With my grades,
I think vet is history.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.320
I don't think so.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.447
You can't give up in life.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.415
There's my tree.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.626
See? Never lose hope!

38:15.043 --> 38:16.878
Nice, isn't it?

38:17.671 --> 38:19.840
I found my tree for Polo!

38:45.824 --> 38:50.287
second trimester

40:14.830 --> 40:16.123
Stuck?

40:16.665 --> 40:17.707
I'm fine.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.634
Both hung up on the same problem.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.719
Because you distract us.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.848
I was the queen of trigonometry.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.558
Great student, I bet.

40:34.850 --> 40:38.228
My parents went broke
sending me to private school.

40:38.728 --> 40:41.356
I had to be first, best grades.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.150
I was very unhappy.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.653
I'm going to see Polo.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.655
Take Tom.

40:51.074 --> 40:52.617
Or else you don't go.

41:10.802 --> 41:11.720
Polo!

41:15.599 --> 41:17.434
We'll work on dodging.

41:17.726 --> 41:20.145
Tom, try to touch him first.

41:20.437 --> 41:21.521
Then switch off.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.691
Get in position.
Protect your face, Tom.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.234
Start.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.445
Nice dodge, Damien.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.573
Tom, try again. Try to get him.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.534
Damien, keep moving.

41:34.826 --> 41:35.702
That's nice.

41:40.040 --> 41:43.001
Good going,
but don't get carried away.

41:43.293 --> 41:45.295
Once more? Get in position.

41:45.962 --> 41:47.380
Let's go.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.136
Touch.

41:54.304 --> 41:55.347
Boy or girl?

41:55.639 --> 41:56.598
A girl.

41:57.474 --> 41:59.226
I can't wait to go home.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.062
When do you get out?

42:02.354 --> 42:06.191
3 days, but I think
you should stay at the doctor's.

42:07.317 --> 42:11.029
It's more convenient for school.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.907
And she can check your work.

42:14.366 --> 42:17.452
I want to help Dad
and take care of you.

42:17.953 --> 42:19.538
I miss the mountains.

42:19.829 --> 42:24.292
I have home care every other day.
The doctor saw to it.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.171
She sees to everything.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.094
It's better like this. Isn't it?

42:34.636 --> 42:36.221
Yeah, it's better.

44:01.139 --> 44:03.725
We can move!
Mom wants another room.

44:04.017 --> 44:05.769
Why another room?

44:06.227 --> 44:08.521
No fucking way!
Pregnant?

44:09.105 --> 44:11.024
Just an idea.
And we're not old!

44:11.316 --> 44:13.693
- You wouldn't like it?
- Not really!

44:13.985 --> 44:15.779
And I like this place.

44:16.071 --> 44:18.740
It won't be till I'm back.
Think again.

44:19.699 --> 44:21.534
Are you flying these days?

44:22.494 --> 44:25.497
It's been 5 days.
Dust in the turbine.

44:25.789 --> 44:28.958
Miracle it lasted so long.
No spare parts.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.126
Piece of junk!

44:30.418 --> 44:32.837
Respect the equipment, brat!

44:33.129 --> 44:35.715
Get spare parts from the Americans.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.509
You said they trade in booze.

44:37.801 --> 44:39.594
Barter with your beer.

44:39.886 --> 44:42.263
- Good deal for them.
- They do help us.

44:42.764 --> 44:44.766
But they left 2 weeks ago.

44:45.058 --> 44:46.142
We're alone.

44:46.434 --> 44:49.145
One of them left me his baseball cap.

44:49.437 --> 44:50.563
Like it?

44:51.398 --> 44:53.316
- Not bad.
- It's for you.

44:53.608 --> 44:54.442
Really?

44:54.984 --> 44:58.071
Cool, thanks.
Was it at least in combat?

44:58.363 --> 44:59.114
Hold on...

44:59.406 --> 45:00.407
Stinks enough.

45:03.034 --> 45:03.743
Gross.

45:30.770 --> 45:31.813
Say "ahh".

45:41.781 --> 45:43.158
Perfect. Other one.

45:47.704 --> 45:48.830
Perfect.

45:53.293 --> 45:54.836
Strep throat.

45:55.128 --> 45:57.714
In a few days you'll be fine.

45:58.006 --> 45:59.174
Get dressed.

46:00.842 --> 46:04.220
Strong at the farm,
at death's door here.

46:04.512 --> 46:06.222
See your mom yesterday?

46:07.348 --> 46:08.683
She needs bed rest

46:08.975 --> 46:11.227
but this time should be fine.

46:11.519 --> 46:13.313
She seems to think so too.

46:16.316 --> 46:18.234
Finally a real child.

46:18.526 --> 46:20.278
There are no fake children.

46:24.324 --> 46:27.327
If you're sick tonight,
Physics tomorrow?

46:40.965 --> 46:42.258
Smells like weed.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.721
Don't smoke if you're sick.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.057
What'll my mom say?

46:50.934 --> 46:53.019
Let me show you something.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.315
Are you afraid?

46:58.942 --> 46:59.901
Come.

47:06.157 --> 47:07.200
So...

47:08.451 --> 47:10.161
Is this how you did it?

47:11.496 --> 47:13.873
Wanted her to take care of you?

47:15.208 --> 47:16.668
You're into pity?

47:18.253 --> 47:19.379
Tell me...

47:21.089 --> 47:22.340
Was it nice?

47:23.591 --> 47:25.134
When she examined you?

47:26.177 --> 47:27.303
You get hard?

47:28.555 --> 47:29.180
Not here!

47:29.889 --> 47:31.432
Yeah, not here.

47:31.724 --> 47:33.226
I'll choose the place.

48:50.553 --> 48:51.721
Coming?

50:23.021 --> 50:24.188
Let's continue.

50:25.273 --> 50:27.358
Not in the rain. We'll stop.

51:08.816 --> 51:10.860
Hard rain doesn't last long.

51:44.936 --> 51:46.604
I want to go to the lake.

51:46.896 --> 51:48.189
For a swim.

51:48.648 --> 51:49.857
Know it?

51:50.691 --> 51:52.026
It's too cold.

52:48.749 --> 52:50.751
What took you two so long?

52:51.043 --> 52:52.920
I saw my dad at the farm.

52:53.212 --> 52:54.380
I saw Polo.

52:57.049 --> 52:59.510
No muscles despite the training.

52:59.802 --> 53:00.887
That's not true.

53:01.179 --> 53:03.931
- Still can't arm-wrestle!
- Bullshit.

53:04.223 --> 53:05.183
Let's see.

53:06.851 --> 53:07.727
Ready?

53:09.312 --> 53:10.730
So, one...

53:23.075 --> 53:24.368
What a cheater!

53:26.495 --> 53:28.664
- Tom's turn now.
- Come on.

53:28.956 --> 53:30.333
You sure?

53:32.460 --> 53:33.836
Ready, guys?

53:34.962 --> 53:36.047
So...

53:36.547 --> 53:38.466
Ready, set, go!

53:47.058 --> 53:48.226
Yeah, he's strong.

53:49.477 --> 53:50.686
What's for dinner?

53:50.978 --> 53:52.521
I was waiting for you.

53:53.648 --> 53:55.107
I'll make pasta.

54:01.781 --> 54:04.533
Was your husband supposed
to leave so soon?

54:06.327 --> 54:10.206
No, but one call
and within 24 hours, you're off.

54:10.498 --> 54:12.083
Army comes first.

54:12.375 --> 54:13.584
For how long?

54:13.876 --> 54:14.919
4-month mission.

54:15.211 --> 54:15.920
Any news?

54:16.212 --> 54:18.464
They have orders to say all's well.

54:19.423 --> 54:20.049
Cheers!

55:13.978 --> 55:15.646
Can I ask you something?

55:18.858 --> 55:22.403
- Why did you trip me in class?
- Drop it. Old news.

55:26.782 --> 55:28.534
It would help me to know.

55:30.619 --> 55:31.996
I can't say why.

55:34.874 --> 55:36.459
I found you pretentious.

55:37.710 --> 55:40.046
I didn't like how you kept staring.

55:40.629 --> 55:42.298
I keep staring now too.

55:43.716 --> 55:45.426
I guess I got used to it.

55:45.718 --> 55:47.261
Like your earring.

55:48.971 --> 55:51.057
Don't like my earring?

55:51.349 --> 55:53.976
I'm working. Can you go away?

56:10.951 --> 56:13.954
- What are you doing?
- Daylight savings time.

56:52.410 --> 56:55.538
I'll hand you back your mock exams.

56:55.830 --> 56:58.999
It's Tom who got the highest grade.

56:59.291 --> 57:02.128
Would you like to come up here?

57:03.504 --> 57:06.757
I'm happy to give you this...

57:07.216 --> 57:08.884
15 out of 20.

57:10.386 --> 57:12.263
The subject was difficult,

57:12.555 --> 57:16.308
the conflicts and tensions
in the Middle East.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.769
Your essay was very good.

57:19.311 --> 57:21.772
Congratulations, very good work.

57:23.149 --> 57:24.358
Now, Chloé.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.987
Your grade is a little less high: 9.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.614
Almost the average.

57:31.323 --> 57:33.409
Next time you'll have to work

57:34.160 --> 57:35.953
on your methodology.

57:41.292 --> 57:42.585
Can you drive?

57:43.335 --> 57:44.462
Yeah, why?

57:47.715 --> 57:49.592
Can you take me somewhere?

57:50.301 --> 57:52.011
Can't you see I'm working?

58:02.521 --> 58:04.356
For once I ask a favor.

58:12.448 --> 58:13.365
I insist.

58:13.657 --> 58:16.285
I'm not some spoiled kid's slave!

58:18.871 --> 58:20.623
Should I show this to my mom?

58:25.836 --> 58:27.421
Stay on 618.

58:28.756 --> 58:30.508
Turn at the intersection.

58:31.884 --> 58:33.260
To the left.

58:45.981 --> 58:46.941
Where are we?

58:47.233 --> 58:48.943
In fact it wasn't far.

58:51.362 --> 58:52.321
Wait here.

58:53.906 --> 58:55.741
Yeah, it was easy.

59:17.555 --> 59:19.473
- How old are you?
- 19.

59:28.649 --> 59:29.900
You're too young.

59:30.317 --> 59:32.528
- I'm 19.
- You are not.

59:35.281 --> 59:36.323
You lied too.

59:36.949 --> 59:38.117
You're not 25.

59:38.701 --> 59:41.579
You're right. I lie too.
I round it down.

59:52.089 --> 59:53.299
Live here alone?

59:55.634 --> 59:57.720
It was too good to be true.

59:58.012 --> 1:00:00.472
People don't come here till summer.

1:00:01.724 --> 1:00:03.350
Fresh blood.

1:00:03.642 --> 1:00:05.269
A bit too fresh.

1:00:07.479 --> 1:00:08.814
Had sex before?

1:00:14.570 --> 1:00:15.904
We can kiss.

1:00:36.342 --> 1:00:37.468
Let's go.

1:00:41.388 --> 1:00:42.598
Is all this yours?

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:44.767
- Livestock housing?
- Yes.

1:00:45.059 --> 1:00:46.810
Can you give me a tour?

1:00:48.854 --> 1:00:50.314
How much cattle in all?

1:00:50.606 --> 1:00:53.400
130 here and more at my Dad's place.

1:00:53.692 --> 1:00:56.528
Including the calves, about 200.

1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:59.490
- They never graze?
- Different system.

1:00:59.782 --> 1:01:02.826
- No hoof trouble?
- I wash them daily.

1:01:11.669 --> 1:01:13.295
What are the blue tags?

1:01:13.587 --> 1:01:15.756
Badges for the smart doors.

1:01:16.048 --> 1:01:17.716
What are smart doors?

1:01:18.008 --> 1:01:19.426
There are 3 zones.

1:01:19.718 --> 1:01:21.512
It makes it easy for them.

1:01:21.804 --> 1:01:24.848
Sleep zone with mattresses.
When they're hungry,

1:01:25.432 --> 1:01:27.935
a smart door regulates their movement.

1:01:28.227 --> 1:01:31.271
It sends them to be milked or fed.

1:01:31.814 --> 1:01:35.693
The smart door chooses
based on milking potential.

1:01:46.870 --> 1:01:49.623
Her estimated production:

1:01:49.915 --> 1:01:50.708
She's at 1.

1:01:50.999 --> 1:01:53.460
Same thing, udder by udder.

1:01:53.919 --> 1:01:56.547
All channeled to the milk tank.

1:01:56.839 --> 1:01:58.507
They go in by themselves.

1:01:58.799 --> 1:02:00.509
No food or water otherwise.

1:02:00.801 --> 1:02:03.303
For either, they have to get milked.

1:02:03.595 --> 1:02:04.972
Average production?

1:02:05.264 --> 1:02:07.433
Some produce 130 pounds a day.

1:02:07.725 --> 1:02:09.017
Day and night?

1:02:09.309 --> 1:02:11.562
24/7, 365 days a year.

1:02:31.999 --> 1:02:33.542
You made a nice friend.

1:02:36.670 --> 1:02:38.630
He told me why you went.

1:02:40.257 --> 1:02:41.175
Surprised?

1:02:41.467 --> 1:02:43.135
Nothing you do surprises me.

1:02:50.934 --> 1:02:54.271
I don't know if I'm into guys
or just you.

1:03:03.530 --> 1:03:05.032
You were more his type.

1:03:13.957 --> 1:03:15.334
Did he try to fuck?

1:03:15.834 --> 1:03:17.503
No one fucks with me!

1:03:17.795 --> 1:03:18.879
Don't forget it.

1:04:44.548 --> 1:04:46.717
Go straight after the tunnel.

1:04:56.226 --> 1:04:59.271
- Why are you here?
- If Tom can't drive...

1:04:59.938 --> 1:05:02.399
We need to get your dad's car home.

1:05:04.192 --> 1:05:05.819
I hope it's not serious.

1:05:08.238 --> 1:05:09.406
How did he fall?

1:05:21.335 --> 1:05:22.878
Move your fingers.

1:05:25.881 --> 1:05:27.799
- Does it hurt here?
- No.

1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:29.635
Here?

1:05:31.762 --> 1:05:32.512
Here?

1:05:58.872 --> 1:06:00.040
Let's go.

1:06:06.004 --> 1:06:07.255
Both of you, sit.

1:06:10.676 --> 1:06:11.802
Not there.

1:06:12.678 --> 1:06:13.804
You here...

1:06:14.846 --> 1:06:16.264
And you here.

1:06:16.556 --> 1:06:18.058
Take off your shirt.

1:06:21.937 --> 1:06:22.980
Move it.

1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:24.564
What's this?

1:06:27.109 --> 1:06:28.819
Take off yours too.

1:06:32.114 --> 1:06:33.281
Help him.

1:06:34.992 --> 1:06:37.202
What are all these bruises?

1:06:39.663 --> 1:06:41.289
They're not recent.

1:06:41.915 --> 1:06:43.166
You fought!

1:06:45.836 --> 1:06:47.254
Where did you do it?

1:06:47.879 --> 1:06:49.297
In the mountains.

1:06:49.589 --> 1:06:51.049
A place I know.

1:06:53.677 --> 1:06:55.762
Has this crap been going on long?

1:06:58.432 --> 1:07:00.017
Tomorrow you go home.

1:07:22.289 --> 1:07:23.373
Wait.

1:07:26.877 --> 1:07:27.919
Let me.

1:07:33.884 --> 1:07:35.010
I'm hungry.

1:07:35.719 --> 1:07:36.762
Aren't you?

1:07:37.512 --> 1:07:38.555
Yes.

1:07:41.183 --> 1:07:42.100
Thanks.

1:07:42.517 --> 1:07:44.603
For not saying where we were.

1:07:44.895 --> 1:07:47.481
It wasn't easy. She kept insisting.

1:07:48.315 --> 1:07:50.108
She wants to know everything.

1:07:55.447 --> 1:07:56.698
But she doesn't.

1:07:58.325 --> 1:07:59.534
No one does.

1:08:00.619 --> 1:08:01.828
Except you.

1:08:11.421 --> 1:08:12.798
What will you tell them?

1:08:13.090 --> 1:08:16.343
Excellent grades,
no need to stay anymore.

1:08:23.517 --> 1:08:24.601
And for this?

1:08:25.393 --> 1:08:27.020
You fell, that's all.

1:09:22.742 --> 1:09:23.827
It's okay.

1:09:24.578 --> 1:09:26.288
Okay meaning what?

1:09:26.580 --> 1:09:27.497
Tell me.

1:09:28.957 --> 1:09:30.584
Cut the officialese.

1:09:32.210 --> 1:09:34.754
There was more ground fighting.

1:09:35.046 --> 1:09:36.965
Our guys took it bad.

1:09:37.507 --> 1:09:40.260
Radicals prefer hand-to-hand combat.

1:09:40.719 --> 1:09:43.680
They know
choppers mean more casualties.

1:09:44.264 --> 1:09:46.933
If we open fire, we can hit our men.

1:09:47.809 --> 1:09:51.188
We went in 3 times today
for our wounded.

1:09:51.938 --> 1:09:54.900
A sergeant took a rocket
in the stomach.

1:09:55.192 --> 1:09:56.151
He's gone.

1:09:57.611 --> 1:09:58.361
It was tough.

1:09:59.029 --> 1:10:01.781
Squadron came back full of bullet holes.

1:10:02.490 --> 1:10:04.701
- But I'm fine.
- Nathan, my God.

1:10:04.993 --> 1:10:07.245
They can't hold out long anyway.

1:10:07.537 --> 1:10:11.124
Their forces are dwindling.
They'll retreat north.

1:10:11.666 --> 1:10:13.793
We'll be able to relax.

1:10:14.085 --> 1:10:15.837
Play volleyball again.

1:10:16.713 --> 1:10:19.132
It's fun. The whole base plays.

1:10:19.424 --> 1:10:22.135
Pilots and mechanics formed a team.

1:10:22.928 --> 1:10:27.140
The general promised
a 45-pound ham to the winners.

1:10:27.432 --> 1:10:29.017
They're damned motivated.

1:10:30.143 --> 1:10:31.853
Nice change from mess-hall.

1:10:32.812 --> 1:10:33.688
So?

1:10:34.105 --> 1:10:34.981
How about you?

1:10:37.067 --> 1:10:38.068
I miss you.

1:10:40.028 --> 1:10:41.279
I miss you too.

1:10:42.239 --> 1:10:43.615
I wear your perfume.

1:10:46.284 --> 1:10:49.329
They tease me. So what?
It makes me happy.

1:10:51.164 --> 1:10:54.167
I have a briefing at command center.

1:10:54.459 --> 1:10:55.460
Duty calls.

1:10:56.086 --> 1:10:58.755
Me too. I have patients waiting.

1:11:02.509 --> 1:11:03.468
I love you.

1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:05.053
I love you too.

1:11:36.835 --> 1:11:39.087
Exile & Migrations

1:11:39.921 --> 1:11:44.718
Now we're going to study the
first packet - right over here.

1:11:45.635 --> 1:11:47.220
Can you pass these out please?

1:11:47.929 --> 1:11:53.059
And then we're going to write
an essay on the theme, OK?

1:11:53.351 --> 1:11:54.352
Yes, come in.

1:11:55.186 --> 1:11:57.522
Tomas! You're so late!

1:11:57.814 --> 1:11:58.857
I'm sorry.

1:11:59.232 --> 1:12:00.275
C'mon man! What happened?

1:12:00.734 --> 1:12:02.110
I broke my wrist.

1:12:02.402 --> 1:12:04.279
No no no! I want it in Spanish, please.
Now what happened?

1:12:04.904 --> 1:12:08.658
Yes... I... have a... married wrist.

1:12:10.076 --> 1:12:13.997
'Casada' is wrong because 'casada'
means 'married'. You see?

1:12:14.414 --> 1:12:16.583
You must say: Tengo la muñeca rota.

1:12:17.459 --> 1:12:19.836
Well you could do better than that
but you're late enough as it is.

1:12:20.211 --> 1:12:22.130
Have a seat. OK let's go!

1:12:22.964 --> 1:12:27.010
You there, please read the
cultural data aloud for the class.

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:32.557
Between the end of the Spanish
Civil War in 1936 and the

1:12:33.016 --> 1:12:37.312
beginning of the Second World War,
around 500,000 Spanish Republicans

1:12:37.604 --> 1:12:42.067
migrated to France in exile, and
defended her against the Germans.

1:12:42.359 --> 1:12:45.028
OK, great job! Can someone else
read the next part?

1:14:23.084 --> 1:14:24.961
Take him to the infirmary.

1:14:32.677 --> 1:14:33.470
I bit my tongue.

1:14:33.761 --> 1:14:36.764
Principal told me everything.
Tom's expelled.

1:14:37.056 --> 1:14:38.141
For a head-butt?

1:14:38.433 --> 1:14:42.020
He could have broken your jaw.
You'd be like this.

1:14:42.312 --> 1:14:44.606
- I felt nothing.
- Nonsense.

1:14:45.023 --> 1:14:46.524
It's excruciating.

1:14:47.066 --> 1:14:48.818
Open your mouth. I'll check.

1:14:57.702 --> 1:14:59.078
No need to say "ahh".

1:15:01.122 --> 1:15:02.999
You don't need stitches.

1:15:03.416 --> 1:15:05.210
You'll gargle.

1:15:05.502 --> 1:15:07.128
The nurse said so too.

1:15:07.670 --> 1:15:09.172
Is he really expelled?

1:15:09.589 --> 1:15:10.965
It's only normal.

1:15:22.852 --> 1:15:23.853
Come in.

1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:33.780
I was wrong to ask him here.

1:15:47.877 --> 1:15:49.629
You didn't fight back.

1:15:55.969 --> 1:15:57.720
Why did he hit so hard?

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:07.230
I tried to kiss him.

1:16:15.405 --> 1:16:16.698
Nothing to say?

1:16:21.202 --> 1:16:22.745
No, I'm listening.

1:16:27.750 --> 1:16:29.085
And what's to say?

1:16:51.482 --> 1:16:52.817
I got kicked out.

1:16:54.110 --> 1:16:55.069
Say what?

1:16:55.361 --> 1:16:56.446
Expelled.

1:16:56.738 --> 1:16:57.864
What did you do?

1:16:58.489 --> 1:16:59.949
Too late. It's done.

1:17:00.241 --> 1:17:01.534
It's better this way.

1:17:07.498 --> 1:17:08.916
How about exams?

1:17:10.418 --> 1:17:11.961
How will you graduate?

1:17:12.378 --> 1:17:14.047
I'll study from home.

1:17:14.631 --> 1:17:17.008
Don't worry.
I learned how to work.

1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:20.720
Not a word to your mother.

1:17:22.013 --> 1:17:22.805
Why not?

1:17:23.097 --> 1:17:25.433
She'll get nervous. No use.

1:17:25.725 --> 1:17:26.976
For the baby?

1:17:28.436 --> 1:17:29.896
I hope this one...

1:17:30.563 --> 1:17:32.315
will make you happy.

1:18:08.643 --> 1:18:11.396
third trimester

1:18:22.782 --> 1:18:24.617
Principal sent me home.

1:18:26.119 --> 1:18:29.372
The Army called to confirm our address.

1:18:30.123 --> 1:18:31.666
No fucking way.

1:19:20.798 --> 1:19:21.716
Good afternoon.

1:19:22.133 --> 1:19:24.302
I'm the regiment's social worker.

1:19:58.711 --> 1:20:00.671
Present arms!

1:20:14.018 --> 1:20:14.685
Halt.

1:20:14.977 --> 1:20:15.937
One.

1:20:21.567 --> 1:20:22.610
Three.

1:20:24.278 --> 1:20:25.238
Four.

1:20:33.079 --> 1:20:33.830
To the left.

1:20:34.121 --> 1:20:34.956
Left.

1:20:35.248 --> 1:20:36.749
Together, cushions down.

1:21:11.742 --> 1:21:13.369
Captain Nathan Delille,

1:21:14.495 --> 1:21:17.039
on behalf of the Defense Minister,

1:21:17.331 --> 1:21:21.752
we give you
the Military Valor Cross, with palm.

1:21:28.551 --> 1:21:30.261
Captain Nathan Delille,

1:21:30.845 --> 1:21:32.763
on behalf of the President,

1:21:34.265 --> 1:21:36.976
we name you
Knight of the Legion of Honor.

1:21:40.187 --> 1:21:41.355
To the fallen!

1:22:19.685 --> 1:22:21.520
Tom, come help me.

1:22:25.107 --> 1:22:26.943
Can you knot my tie?

1:22:27.234 --> 1:22:29.236
- Not ready?
- I'm not going.

1:22:29.528 --> 1:22:30.780
You can't do that.

1:22:31.072 --> 1:22:33.699
My wrist still hurts.
I'll stay with you.

1:22:34.116 --> 1:22:35.868
If I could go, I would.

1:22:36.744 --> 1:22:38.913
Let your mother do it...

1:22:40.373 --> 1:22:41.499
Go ahead.

1:22:45.169 --> 1:22:46.545
What a pain.

1:23:09.151 --> 1:23:10.569
Listen, Tom...

1:23:12.363 --> 1:23:13.781
He helped us.

1:23:14.323 --> 1:23:16.033
He took you in his home.

1:23:16.742 --> 1:23:17.868
So you're coming.

1:23:25.376 --> 1:23:28.671
In infinite sadness, I stand before you

1:23:29.463 --> 1:23:31.298
to salute my lifelong friend,

1:23:31.590 --> 1:23:34.802
to recall the memory
of a husband, a father

1:23:35.302 --> 1:23:38.097
a friend whose brutal, glorious death

1:23:38.389 --> 1:23:41.350
leaves us mourning someone
who was loving,

1:23:41.851 --> 1:23:44.687
protective and kind.

1:23:45.271 --> 1:23:49.233
Console your comrades
who couldn't bring you back alive.

1:23:49.900 --> 1:23:51.402
Console your wife.

1:23:51.694 --> 1:23:53.195
Console your son,

1:23:53.487 --> 1:23:55.865
who lost his father, his hero.

1:24:28.314 --> 1:24:29.482
I wanted to say

1:24:30.274 --> 1:24:31.567
I'm with you.

1:24:32.068 --> 1:24:33.360
For your father.

1:25:46.725 --> 1:25:47.351
Stop!

1:25:47.643 --> 1:25:48.894
Let me go!

1:25:56.819 --> 1:25:58.362
Calm down!

1:26:39.486 --> 1:26:40.905
Try to rest.

1:28:00.025 --> 1:28:01.277
Hungry?

1:28:05.322 --> 1:28:06.448
Want some coffee?

1:28:07.032 --> 1:28:08.242
I'd love some.

1:28:26.510 --> 1:28:27.594
I'm glad you're here.

1:28:30.556 --> 1:28:33.600
I'll stay with her,
while you're at school.

1:28:34.184 --> 1:28:35.686
She mustn't be alone.

1:28:38.814 --> 1:28:40.149
Polo will stop by.

1:28:40.649 --> 1:28:42.359
Polo is in the military.

1:28:42.651 --> 1:28:43.986
Not a good idea.

1:28:48.073 --> 1:28:49.325
I hate these clothes.

1:28:49.742 --> 1:28:51.201
Take some of mine.

1:28:51.827 --> 1:28:53.537
- Can I?
- Sure, go on.

1:29:07.051 --> 1:29:08.510
I'm taking you out.

1:29:13.682 --> 1:29:15.100
I'm taking you out.

1:29:50.052 --> 1:29:52.304
- Thank you.
- Why thank me?

1:29:52.596 --> 1:29:54.348
For saying nothing.

1:29:54.807 --> 1:29:56.058
I have no words.

1:29:56.350 --> 1:29:58.811
No one does, but they all talk.

1:29:59.103 --> 1:30:02.064
It's why I can't see his family or mine.

1:30:02.731 --> 1:30:06.402
Everyone talks,
they say things will get better.

1:30:07.027 --> 1:30:08.946
I know they'll get better.

1:30:09.238 --> 1:30:10.364
I even hope so.

1:30:10.823 --> 1:30:12.491
But I also know that...

1:30:13.867 --> 1:30:16.912
I won't have accepted his death then.

1:30:18.414 --> 1:30:20.833
I'll just have forgotten he died.

1:30:22.835 --> 1:30:25.629
Every time I forget
will be a time of joy.

1:30:26.463 --> 1:30:28.424
Followed by a time of pain,

1:30:28.715 --> 1:30:30.884
when I learn once again he's dead.

1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:40.602
You wanted to show me the mountains...

1:30:41.353 --> 1:30:42.729
Next time.

1:30:48.068 --> 1:30:50.112
Making sense of my notes?

1:30:50.404 --> 1:30:52.156
I don't want to get blocked.

1:30:52.448 --> 1:30:54.450
I know about being blocked.

1:31:00.205 --> 1:31:01.707
You got your room back?

1:31:10.799 --> 1:31:11.842
Look.

1:31:12.134 --> 1:31:13.635
My dad's watch.

1:31:18.182 --> 1:31:19.266
I'm scared to wear it.

1:31:27.399 --> 1:31:30.861
As for the tombstone, it'll be...

1:31:31.153 --> 1:31:34.198
a marble slab
with an engraved headstone.

1:31:34.490 --> 1:31:35.949
- The simplest?
- Yes.

1:31:36.241 --> 1:31:38.494
Or else something like...

1:31:38.785 --> 1:31:40.537
that vault, more ornate.

1:31:40.996 --> 1:31:41.997
No, the simplest.

1:31:42.289 --> 1:31:44.374
Like the one behind you.

1:31:44.666 --> 1:31:46.668
With the pink marble?

1:31:47.127 --> 1:31:48.128
How long will it take?

1:31:48.629 --> 1:31:51.673
2-3 weeks,
depending on the marble mason.

1:31:56.762 --> 1:31:59.473
Thanks, I couldn't have come alone.

1:31:59.765 --> 1:32:00.766
And Damien?

1:32:01.058 --> 1:32:03.185
I'd rather spare him all this.

1:32:14.863 --> 1:32:17.157
"To desire", from Latin "desirat":

1:32:17.449 --> 1:32:19.451
to regret something's absence.

1:32:19.743 --> 1:32:21.995
The best definition is Leibniz's:

1:32:22.746 --> 1:32:25.123
"The anxiety man feels within

1:32:25.415 --> 1:32:29.419
"by the absence of something pleasurable
when present

1:32:29.711 --> 1:32:31.547
"is what we call desire.

1:32:32.464 --> 1:32:37.719
"A willful striving towards a goal,
desire is particular to mankind."

1:32:44.893 --> 1:32:49.898
I'll read a passage
about desire from Plato's Symposium.

1:32:50.816 --> 1:32:54.319
He says:
"If man sows seeds with woman,

1:32:54.611 --> 1:32:57.239
"they breed and the race continues.

1:32:57.531 --> 1:32:59.575
"But should man come to man,

1:32:59.866 --> 1:33:03.620
"they will find mutual satiety
in their relation."

1:33:05.038 --> 1:33:06.123
Satiety.

1:33:06.582 --> 1:33:07.791
Mutual satisfaction.

1:33:08.584 --> 1:33:10.544
You're really heavy-handed.

1:33:11.336 --> 1:33:13.046
It's the curriculum.

1:33:13.755 --> 1:33:14.840
Okay then.

1:33:15.299 --> 1:33:16.550
Let's continue.

1:33:17.342 --> 1:33:19.970
The difference between desire and need.

1:33:20.512 --> 1:33:23.181
Need is part of nature.

1:33:23.473 --> 1:33:25.601
It is necessary, vital.

1:33:26.435 --> 1:33:27.477
Desire...

1:33:27.936 --> 1:33:29.605
is not of natural origin.

1:33:29.896 --> 1:33:30.814
Artificial.

1:33:31.773 --> 1:33:32.941
Incidental.

1:33:33.900 --> 1:33:35.068
Superfluous.

1:33:45.412 --> 1:33:46.371
Feel dizzy?

1:33:46.663 --> 1:33:47.748
I'm fine.

1:33:48.707 --> 1:33:50.167
I swear it's worth it.

1:33:59.426 --> 1:34:02.262
Before I saw the city from here,
from above.

1:34:10.604 --> 1:34:11.897
See your house?

1:34:13.148 --> 1:34:14.024
There.

1:34:14.316 --> 1:34:16.443
Four blocks after the steeple.

1:34:16.735 --> 1:34:17.402
See?

1:34:19.780 --> 1:34:21.114
I see it.

1:34:37.422 --> 1:34:39.216
That way down is easier.

1:34:41.426 --> 1:34:43.303
I can't live here anymore.

1:34:44.388 --> 1:34:45.722
You're leaving?

1:34:47.933 --> 1:34:49.017
Far?

1:34:49.768 --> 1:34:51.103
I'd prefer.

1:34:56.108 --> 1:34:58.193
But don't tell Damien.

1:34:58.485 --> 1:34:59.861
Why not tell him?

1:35:00.862 --> 1:35:03.490
I'm afraid he'll be sad over you.

1:35:08.745 --> 1:35:10.580
Don't mix wine with your meds.

1:35:11.289 --> 1:35:12.791
I've chosen to drink.

1:35:13.375 --> 1:35:16.169
Boozehound mom
beats depressed mom.

1:35:16.628 --> 1:35:17.879
Whatever you say.

1:35:24.302 --> 1:35:27.973
I'm sick of being the patient.
Doctor is more fun.

1:35:35.063 --> 1:35:36.857
You'll start working?

1:35:39.443 --> 1:35:41.278
You really feel up to it?

1:35:44.197 --> 1:35:46.241
I'm scared, but we'll see.

1:35:48.869 --> 1:35:52.038
I'm exhausted. We went hiking today.

1:35:54.082 --> 1:35:55.375
Not eating?

1:35:56.835 --> 1:35:58.253
I'm falling asleep.

1:36:00.088 --> 1:36:03.091
Good sign. It means I don't need pills.

1:36:04.593 --> 1:36:05.886
So long, Tom.

1:36:32.579 --> 1:36:33.872
Why didn't you eat?

1:36:36.291 --> 1:36:37.709
You have to leave.

1:36:40.921 --> 1:36:43.799
If she can work,
you have no need to stay.

1:36:50.555 --> 1:36:52.057
Why are you staring?

1:36:54.309 --> 1:36:55.852
I'm in love with you.

1:36:57.437 --> 1:36:58.522
Hear me?

1:37:05.904 --> 1:37:08.365
You may feel shame, but I refuse to.

1:37:12.953 --> 1:37:14.120
You pity me!

1:37:14.412 --> 1:37:16.832
What a pain.
You talk too much.

1:37:17.123 --> 1:37:19.876
You couldn't even see
I was scared.

1:41:42.305 --> 1:41:43.932
How did you get here?

1:41:45.100 --> 1:41:47.185
By bus and by foot, like you.

1:41:48.603 --> 1:41:51.564
- Didn't get lost?
- No, as you can see.

1:41:53.525 --> 1:41:56.236
- I needed to see you.
- Not too close.

1:41:57.112 --> 1:41:58.154
Hello, Damien.

1:41:58.446 --> 1:42:00.865
- Coffee?
- No, we'll fix the fence.

1:42:01.533 --> 1:42:02.659
Coffee afterwards.

1:42:03.743 --> 1:42:05.286
Come help me.

1:42:08.957 --> 1:42:10.291
I said to come.

1:42:15.964 --> 1:42:17.549
Give me the pliers.

1:42:19.134 --> 1:42:20.718
Pull the wire.

1:42:27.016 --> 1:42:28.476
Why did you leave?

1:42:29.519 --> 1:42:31.437
Your mom doesn't need me.

1:42:32.272 --> 1:42:33.940
That's not what I meant.

1:42:34.816 --> 1:42:36.276
What did you mean?

1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:38.653
Last night.

1:42:39.571 --> 1:42:40.989
Pull the wire.

1:42:42.615 --> 1:42:45.368
Just a one-shot thing.
You regret it?

1:42:45.660 --> 1:42:47.078
No, I don't.

1:42:48.580 --> 1:42:50.748
So you did it to console me.

1:42:52.125 --> 1:42:53.585
It didn't work.

1:42:53.877 --> 1:42:55.461
It made me sad.

1:42:55.753 --> 1:42:58.256
That proves it's not a good thing.

1:42:58.798 --> 1:43:00.300
It is a good thing.

1:43:01.342 --> 1:43:02.385
Let go.

1:43:05.096 --> 1:43:06.222
Not here.

1:43:09.058 --> 1:43:10.310
Let's do some more.

1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:20.486
Glad you came.

1:43:20.778 --> 1:43:21.946
We fixed the fence.

1:43:23.156 --> 1:43:24.949
I'm not too good at it.

1:43:25.241 --> 1:43:28.661
But I'm learning.
Not many mountain farms left.

1:43:28.953 --> 1:43:32.332
Big business lobbies gobble us all up.

1:43:32.624 --> 1:43:36.002
How is Marianne?
Tom said she's working again.

1:43:36.544 --> 1:43:38.546
You'll bring her cherries?

1:43:41.299 --> 1:43:42.759
And how are you doing?

1:43:43.176 --> 1:43:44.677
You mean the baby?

1:43:44.969 --> 1:43:45.595
All's well.

1:43:45.887 --> 1:43:49.641
Hard to believe
but for once it seems fine.

1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:52.352
I'm not used to so much rest.

1:43:52.644 --> 1:43:54.312
You're always welcome.

1:43:54.854 --> 1:43:56.940
Drive him back in the van.

1:43:57.232 --> 1:44:00.151
I already helped you.
I need to study.

1:44:00.443 --> 1:44:03.279
- I'll drive you back.
- Don't bother.

1:44:04.030 --> 1:44:06.741
I'll go back by foot, like I came.

1:44:34.686 --> 1:44:37.522
I should have given these
for the evening news.

1:44:37.981 --> 1:44:39.774
Isn't he handsome?

1:44:40.566 --> 1:44:42.986
But they wanted him in uniform.

1:44:49.534 --> 1:44:51.744
Careful. It's all sorted.

1:44:52.328 --> 1:44:54.455
This was before the army.

1:44:57.667 --> 1:44:59.377
He had long hair then.

1:45:02.338 --> 1:45:05.300
- They could have saved him.
- Enough.

1:45:07.427 --> 1:45:10.805
- Dead from a thigh wound?
- The artery was hit.

1:45:11.180 --> 1:45:13.141
What crap! I don't buy it.

1:45:20.356 --> 1:45:24.360
Letting him bleed was misconduct.
You should sue!

1:45:24.652 --> 1:45:27.530
No, Damien, it's a war. You get it?

1:45:27.822 --> 1:45:29.824
He was at war. It was his job.

1:45:31.868 --> 1:45:35.079
You're playing the hero card.
Warrior pride.

1:45:36.164 --> 1:45:37.790
He risked his life.
Too bad for us.

1:45:38.082 --> 1:45:40.585
You're exhausting me.
I've had it!

1:46:12.241 --> 1:46:13.242
Expecting someone?

1:46:16.537 --> 1:46:17.789
Why are you here?

1:46:19.415 --> 1:46:20.750
Are you okay?

1:46:22.210 --> 1:46:23.586
What's wrong?

1:46:25.713 --> 1:46:26.756
What is it?

1:46:29.926 --> 1:46:31.469
She's giving birth.

1:46:31.886 --> 1:46:33.388
They left at 3.

1:46:33.888 --> 1:46:36.516
- Why aren't you there?
- Because...

1:46:37.683 --> 1:46:39.102
She won't make it.

1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:40.978
Of course she will.

1:46:41.521 --> 1:46:43.231
It will all be fine.

1:46:43.731 --> 1:46:47.318
She almost carried to term.
There's no risk now.

1:46:48.778 --> 1:46:51.197
I'll get dressed and we'll go.

1:46:54.575 --> 1:46:56.285
Don't leave me either.

1:46:57.120 --> 1:46:58.329
Of course not.

1:47:11.843 --> 1:47:13.803
See? Everything went well.

1:47:16.097 --> 1:47:17.181
Come in.

1:47:19.058 --> 1:47:21.018
- Hold your sister.
- I can't.

1:47:21.310 --> 1:47:22.937
Sure you can. Come here.

1:47:23.229 --> 1:47:24.230
Take her.

1:47:24.689 --> 1:47:25.690
Come here.

1:47:26.149 --> 1:47:27.358
Stand there.

1:47:27.900 --> 1:47:30.361
Come, my little angel.

1:47:36.701 --> 1:47:38.035
He went all quiet.

1:47:39.579 --> 1:47:41.289
I'll leave your family.

1:47:43.916 --> 1:47:45.626
It's all thanks to you.

1:47:46.794 --> 1:47:48.004
It really is.

1:47:49.630 --> 1:47:50.631
Hello...

1:47:53.134 --> 1:47:55.511
- Your eyes are red.
- I cried.

1:47:55.928 --> 1:47:57.763
I keep crying these days.

1:47:58.222 --> 1:48:00.224
I'm proud you're sensitive.

1:48:00.516 --> 1:48:01.642
Yeah, right.

1:48:01.934 --> 1:48:03.269
I mean it.

1:48:13.196 --> 1:48:14.864
This is in Lyon.

1:48:15.823 --> 1:48:17.575
I'd take over the practice.

1:48:20.369 --> 1:48:21.579
You want to leave?

1:48:23.498 --> 1:48:26.584
Tom will come visit when he wants to.

1:48:27.627 --> 1:48:29.003
He won't want to.

1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:32.757
You're lacking in confidence.

1:48:33.591 --> 1:48:34.717
In what?

1:48:35.259 --> 1:48:38.429
Confidence in yourself,
in others, in life.
