And I chopped his finger off really quick,
and then I'm like, “Is this what you want?”

19:10.720 --> 19:12.245
He started screaming, you know.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.845
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.605
If Brian LeFevre is dead, then
who the hell are these people?

19:16.680 --> 19:21.891
Just a couple of people
who totally got off, bro.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.048
What? You did?
Mmm!

19:24.160 --> 19:25.650
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.569
Just... during this?
Whoo-hoo!

19:27.640 --> 19:29.324
Big time. Yeah.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.856
I got off a couple times when we were
watching the video presentation.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.646
Then when he called me out for not being
Brian LeFevre? VVhoo! That got me big time.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.256
- That did it?
- Oh, man, did I get off.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.336
Yeah. Then he showed the finger.
That was the big one.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.256
The dead finger got you off? I am so
confused. That was the climax, really.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.886
Oh, my God. It was amazing.
It was mostly sexual.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.456
Goddamn you, okay? I could've
gotten some cash out of these men.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.256
I could've gotten
a free pair of shoes, but no.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.976
You said, “Hang in there. I'll help you
get off. I'll help you get off, Dee.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.216
I'll show you how.” And then
you leave me all on my own...

19:54.240 --> 19:56.736
to try and just get off all by myself
without-I did everything that I could.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.096
I don't understand why you couldn't
get off. That's not my fault.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.531
Some women just don't know how.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.483
What?
I don't know what it is.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.722
Sometimes it's only
the guy who gets off.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.122
Well, look, I don't know what
the hell's going on over there.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.089
But I can tell you something-

20:10.160 --> 20:14.927
that there is something really palpable,
wonderful going on over here.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.571
I love this company.

20:17.640 --> 20:21.486
I love it more than life. I built
this company with these hands.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.085
Built it from the ground up.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.407
This is a comp-
[Cell Phone Rings]

20:25.480 --> 20:27.448
Wait. Excuse me.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.285
Hello?

20:30.360 --> 20:32.840
It's done? Oh.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.042
Good. Right.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.681
All right, that's it. It's over. You
can all go. The company's gone.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.922
[ Murmuring ]
What are you talking about?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.049
I stripped the company, sold it to
the Chinks, and they shut it down.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.851
- [ Murmuring ] - In a
sense, you're all fired.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.730
Out. You can all go.
Thank you and good-bye.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.211
Get out. Get out. Go.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.363
Hey, Frank, whoa, whoa. I-
Dude, I do not understand.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.841
I thought you loved the company.
I do.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.400
But not more than money, and I
just made a shitload of it.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.567
You get it?
Yeah.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.640
See, Charlie?

21:01.680 --> 21:03.125
Speaking of which,

21:03.280 --> 21:06.284
tell me more about this crowtein.
