43:12.490 --> 43:15.255
<i>Dan: Donovan McNabb
was 14-for-19 passing</i>

43:15.327 --> 43:19.127
<i>for a total of 163 yards
and no touchdowns.</i>

43:19.197 --> 43:20.392
<i>He also ran for 19 yards...</i>

43:20.465 --> 43:22.559
Could the show be
any stiffer tonight?

43:22.634 --> 43:23.829
It's pretty stiff.

43:23.902 --> 43:24.698
Yes, it is.

43:24.769 --> 43:26.760
-- It'll loosen up. -- It
can only loosen up, Jeremy,

43:26.838 --> 43:28.363
'cause I don't think
it's possible

43:28.440 --> 43:29.498
for it to be any stiffer.

43:29.574 --> 43:30.598
Stand by 55.

43:30.675 --> 43:32.575
I thought last night was
as bad as we could get,

43:32.644 --> 43:34.612
but it turns out we had
unexplored potential

43:34.679 --> 43:35.771
<i>for stiffness.</i>

43:35.847 --> 43:36.905
-- Go 55.
-- No, wait.

43:36.982 --> 43:38.313
-- Go 55.
-- That's wrong.

43:38.383 --> 43:39.976
-- Now! -- Damn it,
Dave, get it together.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.746
Stand by 56.

43:41.820 --> 43:42.309
That's what we need --

43:42.387 --> 43:43.946
we need the control room
to fall apart, too.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.114
That's just what
the doctor ordered.

43:45.190 --> 43:46.658
He's gotten in everyone's head.

43:46.725 --> 43:47.749
Like a virus.

43:47.826 --> 43:50.227
Or like a tiny electrode
that's been surgically placed

43:50.295 --> 43:52.320
in the cerebral cortex
in the middle of the night

43:52.397 --> 43:53.523
by, like, I don't know,

43:53.598 --> 43:55.930
something from "Invasion
of the Body Snatchers."

43:57.369 --> 43:59.269
More like a virus.

44:00.438 --> 44:02.167
See?
I'm totally off my game.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.469
-- He gets his way.
-- Yes.

44:03.541 --> 44:05.566
No matter what,
he seems to get his way.

44:05.644 --> 44:06.975
He does seem to be in control.

44:07.045 --> 44:08.342
After a week.

44:08.413 --> 44:09.574
-- Eight days.
-- Who cares?

44:09.648 --> 44:12.117
It took me two years to
figure out how to run this show.

44:12.183 --> 44:14.550
He comes in here, he gets
in our heads like a virus,

44:14.619 --> 44:17.111
or a whatever it is Jeremy said,

44:17.188 --> 44:19.156
and we're so stiff.

44:19.224 --> 44:20.191
Hey.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.919
Good evening.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.519
Show seems a little stiff
tonight, don't you think?

44:24.596 --> 44:25.586
Yes, I do.

44:25.664 --> 44:27.564
Maybe even stiffer
than last night.

44:27.632 --> 44:29.657
-- I believe it is.
-- You <i>know</i> why?

44:29.734 --> 44:30.929
Because you're freaking
everyone out.

44:31.002 --> 44:33.437
-- Could <i>be.</i>
-- <i>Stand by 57 and 58.</i>

44:33.505 --> 44:36.099
-- You know what I'd do if I were you?
-- KIN myself?

44:36.174 --> 44:38.268
No.
I'd whisper in their ear.

44:38.343 --> 44:39.777
I beg your pardon.

44:39.844 --> 44:42.313
The two of you,
whisper something in their ear.

44:42.380 --> 44:43.541
What are you talking about?

44:43.615 --> 44:46.175
<i>Men like the sound of a woman
whispering in their ear.</i>

44:46.251 --> 44:47.480
They get playful.

44:47.552 --> 44:49.247
Why don't we just get them
a lap dance?

44:49.321 --> 44:51.949
No, we don't have that kind of
time, but I like your thinking.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.684
-- <i>Listen</i> --
-- <i>Whisper in their ear.</i>

44:53.758 --> 44:54.953
I'm not whispering
in their ear,

44:55.026 --> 44:57.256
Natalie's not
whispering in their ear.

44:57.329 --> 44:57.989
If you want, I --

44:58.063 --> 44:59.827
[Snaps fingers] Kim's not
whispering in their ear.

44:59.898 --> 45:00.990
You've gotten everything
you've wanted.

45:01.066 --> 45:02.329
We've been
totally cooperative,

45:02.400 --> 45:05.199
but I'm afraid from 11:00
to 12:00 this is <i>my</i> show.

45:05.270 --> 45:07.762
And I'll deal with things
the way I deal with things.

45:07.839 --> 45:08.772
Okay.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.433
We're in commercial.

45:10.508 --> 45:11.907
<i>Dave." Two minutes back.</i>

45:11.977 --> 45:12.967
Excuse me.

45:13.912 --> 45:16.540
-- I believe we're about to
get a pep talk. -- Yeah.

45:16.614 --> 45:19.777
I've seen brighter performances
by inmates.

45:19.851 --> 45:21.910
-- You mind telling me what the
hell's going on? -- We're just --

45:21.987 --> 45:24.217
I don't want to hear about it.
This show's supposed to be fun.

45:24.289 --> 45:25.950
You guys sound like
you're giving stock quotes.

45:26.024 --> 45:28.220
-- Is there a reason I'm not aware of?
-- We think we should be --

45:28.293 --> 45:30.489
Don't give me your excuses. We've
got 18 minutes of show left.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.894
<i>What I'd like is you guys to
start earning your money.</i>

45:32.964 --> 45:34.363
Do you have anything
you'd like to say?

45:34.432 --> 45:35.365
-- Yeah.
-- Good.

45:36.668 --> 45:38.693
[Footsteps depart]

45:38.770 --> 45:40.704
-- [Clears throat]
-- Donna seems pretty mad.

45:40.772 --> 45:41.705
Dana.

45:41.773 --> 45:42.706
Huh?

45:42.774 --> 45:44.401
Her name's Dana, not Donna.

45:44.476 --> 45:46.274
-- Is that right?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

45:46.344 --> 45:48.073
Dana's a better name.

45:48.146 --> 45:49.636
I'm sure she appreciates that.

45:49.714 --> 45:51.375
You know what I think?

45:51.449 --> 45:53.178
I think my presence
in the studio

45:53.251 --> 45:55.583
and in the control room
is intimidating people.

45:55.653 --> 45:57.985
I think it's preventing you
from doing your best work.

45:58.056 --> 46:00.457
So I'm gonna watch the rest
of the show in the newsroom.

46:00.525 --> 46:02.152
I'm sure Dana will
appreciate that, too.

46:03.495 --> 46:05.691
<i>See? He's weakening.</i>

46:05.764 --> 46:07.755
He doesn't always get his way.

46:07.832 --> 46:09.357
[Chuckles]

46:09.434 --> 46:11.869
Did he just take our script?

46:14.472 --> 46:15.735
We just lost the TelePrompTer.

46:15.807 --> 46:18.105
<i>-- When'? -- We just
lost the TelePrompTer.</i>

46:18.176 --> 46:19.200
15 seconds back.

46:19.277 --> 46:22.042
Dan, Casey, we lost the TelePrompTer.
Work off your scripts.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.309
Sam Donovan stole the script.

46:24.382 --> 46:25.872
Well, then, no problem.

46:25.950 --> 46:30.717
Natalie and I will...
feed you bullet points.

46:30.789 --> 46:33.349
We'll whisper them
in your ear.

46:33.425 --> 46:34.893
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

46:34.959 --> 46:36.358
Welcome back.

46:50.742 --> 46:52.176
They're coming here.

46:52.243 --> 46:53.335
<i>Natalie." When?</i>

46:53.411 --> 46:54.879
8:00.

46:54.946 --> 46:56.345
-- They want to give notes.
-- Yeah.

46:56.414 --> 46:57.575
-- Dana...
-- I know.

46:57.649 --> 46:59.139
-- The wheels are coming off
the wagon, Dana. -- I know.

46:59.217 --> 47:00.412
-- They want to come give notes?
-- Yeah.

47:00.485 --> 47:02.681
<i>Just gather us up
and give us some notes?</i>

47:02.754 --> 47:04.347
They're very serious about it.

47:04.422 --> 47:06.857
-- Who's coming -- J.J. and the boys?
-- Yeah.

47:06.925 --> 47:09.986
Good, 'cause they're qualified to tell us
how to write and produce a television show,

47:10.061 --> 47:13.087
given their many years of experience neither
writing nor producing television shows.

47:13.164 --> 47:16.156
What do you want from me, Natalie?
We work for a network.

47:16.234 --> 47:17.702
-- How did this happen?
-- <i>Look</i> --

47:17.769 --> 47:19.635
How did Sam Donovan happen?

47:19.704 --> 47:21.399
<i>Why are we getting
network notes?</i>

47:21.473 --> 47:24.204
How did this place
turn into a morgue so fast?

47:24.275 --> 47:25.606
We are in third place, Natalie.

47:25.677 --> 47:28.840
We are getting our <i>asses</i> kicked
by ESPN and Fox.

47:28.913 --> 47:31.814
<i>Those guys have been around
forever. We're three years old.</i>

47:31.883 --> 47:33.146
We're still in third place.

47:33.218 --> 47:35.050
Every show on this network's
in third place.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.349
It's a third-place network.

47:36.421 --> 47:38.287
It doesn't mean we weren't
doing the show well.

47:38.356 --> 47:39.824
Isaac had a stroke.

47:39.891 --> 47:41.518
I know that. So what?

47:41.593 --> 47:43.891
-- <i>So I'm</i> doing <i>the best</i> I can.
-- <i>No one's blaming you.</i>

47:43.962 --> 47:45.259
Everyone's blaming me!

47:45.330 --> 47:46.593
<i>And knowing me
as you do, Natalie,</i>

47:46.664 --> 47:49.599
I thought you might consider
cutting me a little slack!

47:59.377 --> 48:02.312
Natalie, if this keeps up,
I gotta...

48:02.380 --> 48:04.747
[Sighs]

48:04.816 --> 48:08.377
...look seriously
at some offers.

48:08.453 --> 48:09.545
Really?

48:09.621 --> 48:11.555
<i>I can work anywhere I want.</i>

48:11.623 --> 48:13.751
Who'd want to stay for this?

48:18.830 --> 48:20.764
Well, you're not
leaving <i>me</i> here.

48:20.832 --> 48:22.266
No.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.301
You're taking me with you,
Dana.

48:24.369 --> 48:25.393
Of course.

48:25.470 --> 48:28.269
<i>I mean, I don't care if it's a station
in Altoona -- you're taking me with you.</i>

48:28.339 --> 48:31.331
I'm taking you with me.
I'm taking you.

48:32.610 --> 48:34.305
Jeremy has to come, too.

48:35.747 --> 48:36.771
Fine.

48:36.848 --> 48:38.839
<i>And you're not gonna be happy
unless Casey's there.</i>

48:41.252 --> 48:43.516
-- <i>Casey</i> can <i>come.</i>
-- <i>Casey needs Dan.</i>

48:47.358 --> 48:49.292
[Voice breaking]
I know.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.351
<i>Nobody's blaming you, Dana.</i>

48:55.266 --> 48:57.428
We've got a rundown meeting.

49:10.582 --> 49:13.313
That's what I like to see at the
noon rundown -- some lively chatter,

49:13.384 --> 49:15.318
the place alive
with energy and ideas.

49:15.386 --> 49:17.252
Oh, the creative process.

49:17.322 --> 49:19.120
-- Dana... -- Stow it. Let's
take care of business.

49:19.190 --> 49:22.319
[Clears throat] There's a, uh,
memo from building maintenance

49:22.393 --> 49:25.328
that one of the legs on the
craft-service table is wobbly,

49:25.396 --> 49:27.888
and we should be careful
while getting ourselves food.

49:27.966 --> 49:29.456
What?

49:29.534 --> 49:31.332
There's a memo
from building maintenance.

49:31.402 --> 49:33.632
That one of the legs on the
craft-service table is wobbly?

49:33.705 --> 49:34.729
Yeah.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.130
[Laughs]

49:37.208 --> 49:39.575
[Laughter]

49:45.316 --> 49:47.216
-- Hey...
_. [Laughter stops]

49:47.285 --> 49:49.811
<i>...the show's important,
but first things first</i> --

49:49.887 --> 49:51.355
there are bagels on that table.

49:51.422 --> 49:52.912
[Laughter resumes]

50:00.298 --> 50:02.130
[Silence]

50:04.202 --> 50:06.569
J.J. and some people
from the network

50:06.638 --> 50:08.265
-- I <i>knew it.</i> -- <i>want to
meet with us at 8:00.</i>

50:08.339 --> 50:10.239
They want to give us
some notes.

50:10.308 --> 50:11.639
-- Damn <i>it.</i>
-- <i>Danny...</i>

50:11.709 --> 50:13.268
-- The network wants to give us notes?
-- Yeah.

50:13.344 --> 50:14.971
-- I thought we were finished with that.
-- Apparently not.

50:15.046 --> 50:16.138
-- And may I ask what --
-- No.

50:16.214 --> 50:18.148
May I ask what you're doing
about this?

50:18.216 --> 50:19.877
I'm having them arrested, Danny.

50:19.951 --> 50:22.420
I'm telling their parents.
I'm telling the teacher.

50:22.487 --> 50:24.546
I'm gonna go to my room
and lock the door.

50:24.622 --> 50:27.421
I'd accept any of those before I'd
believe you'd just let these people in.

50:27.492 --> 50:30.894
-- <i>I'm doing the best</i> I <i>can.</i> -- <i>And the fact that
might be true absolutely terrfffes me, Dana.</i>

50:30.962 --> 50:33.590
<i>-- Danny. -- You've become
a malcontent, Danny.</i>

50:33.665 --> 50:35.292
You've become a secretary, Dana.

50:41.506 --> 50:42.940
Let's do this later.

50:43.007 --> 50:44.771
-- It's okay. We --
-- This meeting's over.

50:47.578 --> 50:49.512
That's nice, man.

50:57.155 --> 50:58.179
We're in trouble.

50:58.256 --> 50:59.417
I know.

51:08.633 --> 51:10.294
[Knock on door]

51:10.368 --> 51:11.335
Who is it?

51:12.770 --> 51:15.205
-- I <i>have gifts for you.</i>
-- <i>That wasn't necessary.</i>

51:17.175 --> 51:18.700
I think it was.

51:18.776 --> 51:22.713
You once took a trip to Napa and you
visited a small vineyard there.

51:22.780 --> 51:24.680
You told me you tried some wine
that you loved,

51:24.749 --> 51:26.513
and you could never
find it anywhere.

51:26.584 --> 51:28.518
I thought
I remembered the name,

51:28.586 --> 51:30.020
but I wasn't sure.

51:30.088 --> 51:31.180
Is this it?

51:31.255 --> 51:32.950
Yes.

51:33.024 --> 51:36.460
Good. I always like
wine and cheese.

51:36.527 --> 51:37.323
I know.

51:37.395 --> 51:38.521
I wanted to get you
some cheese.

51:38.596 --> 51:40.894
There's a great cheese place
over on Second Avenue.

51:40.965 --> 51:43.491
I went over there after I got
the wine, but it's gone.

51:43.568 --> 51:45.229
There's a hardware store
there now.

51:45.303 --> 51:46.498
That's okay.

51:48.106 --> 51:49.574
I got you some Spackle.

51:49.640 --> 51:52.632
[Both laugh]

51:52.710 --> 51:54.109
Thank you.

51:55.546 --> 51:56.980
I'm sorry.

51:57.048 --> 51:59.142
I'm sorry, too.

51:59.217 --> 52:00.412
[Knock on door]

52:00.485 --> 52:02.317
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

52:02.387 --> 52:03.980
Everything all right?

52:04.055 --> 52:05.216
I'm looking at tape.

52:06.691 --> 52:08.557
I'll see you later.

52:11.229 --> 52:12.458
You got some wine.

52:12.530 --> 52:14.328
[Chuckles]
And some Spackle.

52:14.399 --> 52:15.798
You needed Spackle?

52:15.867 --> 52:18.734
No, but, you know,
it's always good to have around.

52:18.803 --> 52:20.066
-- How you feelin'?
-- Terrible.

52:20.138 --> 52:21.401
I've got an idea.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.770
-- What? -- You're gonna say
it's against the rules,

52:23.841 --> 52:25.741
-- but I think it's a really good idea.
-- What?

52:25.810 --> 52:27.710
Let's go on a date tonight.

52:27.779 --> 52:29.304
I think that's a great idea.

52:29.380 --> 52:30.677
But?

52:30.748 --> 52:32.182
It's against the rules.

52:32.250 --> 52:33.342
Yeah, yeah.

52:33.418 --> 52:35.819
Maybe today's not the best day
to talk about it.

52:35.887 --> 52:36.854
No.

52:36.921 --> 52:37.911
Thanks.

52:39.390 --> 52:41.449
Hey, is there anything
I can do for you?

52:41.526 --> 52:43.517
You could stay cool
during the notes meeting.

52:43.594 --> 52:45.528
-- Keep Danny in his chair, too.
-- Yeah.

52:45.596 --> 52:47.690
We gotta remember
it wasn't the network

52:47.765 --> 52:49.733
that brought in Sam Donovan --
it was Isaac,

52:49.801 --> 52:52.065
-- and that makes it a little more...
-- Yeah.

52:52.136 --> 52:53.968
Thanks.

52:54.038 --> 52:55.870
So, I was, uh,

52:55.940 --> 52:58.500
talking with Danny
about the dating plan.

52:58.576 --> 53:00.408
And he thinks
you should be psyched?

53:00.478 --> 53:02.105
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
which I thought was crazy,

53:02.180 --> 53:03.773
but, you know,
maybe I'm the one who's crazy.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.373
Casey, I want you
to date other women.

53:05.450 --> 53:07.919
I don't want you to enjoy it.

53:07.985 --> 53:10.044
Ah.

53:10.121 --> 53:11.054
You see?

53:11.122 --> 53:12.351
Not really.

53:12.423 --> 53:14.892
You know, maybe you could explain it
better to me if we had a date tonight.

53:14.959 --> 53:17.826
I want us to have
a real chance.

53:17.895 --> 53:19.226
I understand.

53:19.297 --> 53:20.458
Do you?

53:20.531 --> 53:22.966
No,
but what choice do I have?

53:23.034 --> 53:24.661
Tsk.

53:27.472 --> 53:30.066
-- [ Sighs]
-- None.

53:30.141 --> 53:31.666
I didn't think so.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.335
You'll stay quiet
with the network?

53:33.411 --> 53:34.503
Yeah.

53:34.579 --> 53:36.377
-- And Danny, too?
-- Yeah.

53:38.282 --> 53:39.340
Thanks.

53:58.169 --> 54:00.035
[Knock on door]

54:00.104 --> 54:03.904
J.J., you know Sam Donovan?

54:03.975 --> 54:05.340
Oh, we haven't met.
It's a pleasure.

54:05.409 --> 54:06.934
-- Hi.
-- This is Ray Mitchel,

54:07.011 --> 54:08.672
Director
of Program Development...

54:08.779 --> 54:09.712
-- Hi.
-- Hi.

54:09.747 --> 54:10.873
...and Billie Tasker,

54:12.583 --> 54:13.573
-- Hi.
-- Hi.

54:18.923 --> 54:22.359
Isaac, we know you're busy,
so we'll cut to the chase.

54:22.426 --> 54:24.053
"Sports Night"'s
been underachieving.

54:24.128 --> 54:26.187
<i>It's not an exaggeration
to say at this point</i>

54:26.264 --> 54:28.255
<i>that the network's concern
is extreme.</i>

54:28.332 --> 54:32.860
Now, Ray and Billie have been writing memos
and sending notes to your staff for a year,

54:32.937 --> 54:35.201
<i>and they have fallen
on deaf ears.</i>

54:35.273 --> 54:36.968
It is simply time for us
to step in.

54:37.041 --> 54:38.873
I'm sorry you feel that way.

54:38.943 --> 54:39.603
Excuse me?

54:39.677 --> 54:42.203
I said I'm sorry
you feel that way,

54:42.280 --> 54:44.715
that the notes have fallen
on deaf ears.

54:44.782 --> 54:47.774
I've always felt that they were
given their due consideration.

54:47.852 --> 54:48.478
They weren't.

54:48.553 --> 54:50.749
You mean because
we didn't take them?

54:50.855 --> 54:55.850
Just because we didn't execute
<i>all</i> the network's suggestions

54:55.927 --> 54:58.089
doesn't mean
we weren't listening.

54:58.162 --> 55:00.597
It just means we didn't agree.

55:00.665 --> 55:03.464
<i>You didn't expect me
to substitute your judgment</i>

55:03.534 --> 55:05.002
for mine, did you, J.J.?

55:05.069 --> 55:06.662
-- Not then, no.
-- But now.

55:06.737 --> 55:07.727
Yes.

55:10.074 --> 55:13.908
Will it keep everyone here
from losing their jobs?

55:13.978 --> 55:15.571
I don't understand.

55:15.646 --> 55:18.047
<i>If I allow you three
to go in there</i>

55:18.115 --> 55:19.173
and mess with my show,

55:19.250 --> 55:22.743
will it keep my staff
from losing their jobs?

55:22.820 --> 55:24.754
I can't make promises.

55:24.855 --> 55:26.789
-- J.J.?
-- Yeah?

55:26.857 --> 55:28.188
I've never liked you.

55:28.259 --> 55:29.624
I know.

55:29.694 --> 55:31.025
We're done.

55:32.363 --> 55:35.492
Sam, can we see you
a second outside?

55:37.134 --> 55:40.035
[Door opens]

55:44.508 --> 55:47.307
It doesn't seem like he's
recovering as fast as we hoped.

55:47.378 --> 55:48.436
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

55:48.512 --> 55:50.913
You guys want to exert more
control over the show, right?

55:50.982 --> 55:51.540
Yeah.

55:51.616 --> 55:54.847
Then it seems like he's recovering
exactly as fast as you'd hoped.

55:54.919 --> 55:58.514
I think our point was that he's
no longer able to do the show.

55:58.589 --> 56:01.957
To tell you the truth, it's not clear
that he was ever able to do the job.

56:02.026 --> 56:04.085
He was a bit of
a sentimental choice --

56:04.161 --> 56:06.255
What we're saying is that you
seem to be able to exert

56:06.330 --> 56:07.456
some authority around here.

56:07.531 --> 56:10.865
And we like the idea of a more sales-oriented
executive at the top of the pyramid.

56:10.935 --> 56:13.563
So we were hoping
when things settle down here

56:13.638 --> 56:16.608
that you'd consider sitting down
and talking to Luther Sachs

56:16.674 --> 56:18.506
about making it permanent.

56:22.380 --> 56:24.075
Was there anything else?

56:24.148 --> 56:25.809
No.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.214
Okay.

56:28.285 --> 56:29.810
Okay.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.321
Great.

56:31.389 --> 56:33.357
Good to meet you.

56:49.006 --> 56:49.939
[Door closes]

56:50.007 --> 56:52.203
This is my favorite time of day

56:52.276 --> 56:55.109
and my favorite time of year
in New York.

56:55.179 --> 56:56.146
Mine too.

56:56.213 --> 56:58.580
Did they offer you my job?

56:58.649 --> 57:00.708
<i>No. They were talking to me
about some numbers</i>

57:00.785 --> 57:02.253
I'd put together on the Midwest.

57:02.319 --> 57:03.548
A small market team --

57:03.621 --> 57:05.385
Don't lie to me, Sam.

57:05.456 --> 57:07.720
They offered me your job.

57:07.792 --> 57:10.557
<i>[ Chuckles 1 You should
play bah with them, son.</i>

57:10.628 --> 57:12.687
You shouldn't mess them around.

57:12.763 --> 57:15.664
You could have a big future
at this network.

57:15.733 --> 57:17.223
I appreciate the advice.

57:17.301 --> 57:19.030
Don't brush me off.

57:19.103 --> 57:22.038
I know you like
being a gunslinger,

57:22.106 --> 57:24.666
bopping from job to job,

57:24.742 --> 57:27.370
but you're better than that,
and you know it.

57:27.445 --> 57:30.039
Also, you're a grown man now.

57:30.114 --> 57:32.606
You don't have 30 cents
in your pocket.

57:32.683 --> 57:33.946
[Both laugh]

57:34.018 --> 57:35.577
Yeah. [Chuckles]

57:35.653 --> 57:37.280
Think about what I said.

57:37.354 --> 57:39.118
You going to this meeting?

57:39.190 --> 57:42.353
No. I'm gonna go sit in the control
room and watch a color test.

57:42.426 --> 57:43.552
<i>You're the managing editor.</i>

57:43.627 --> 57:46.426
You're gonna sit in the control
room and watch a color test?

57:46.497 --> 57:49.762
I feel like doing something that has
something to do with television.

57:49.834 --> 57:51.802
Okay.

57:53.704 --> 57:54.967
[Door closes]

57:55.039 --> 57:56.666
See, and that gets us back

57:56.741 --> 57:58.402
to the same thing
we were talking about

57:58.476 --> 58:01.241
with note <i>22</i> on page 6.

58:01.312 --> 58:03.906
It really all boils down
to the same thing.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.676
-- Well, not all --
-- No, not all.

58:05.750 --> 58:08.344
But what we're saying, and I
think I speak for all of us...

58:08.419 --> 58:10.319
-- Yes. -- That the
problem's in the writing.

58:10.387 --> 58:12.481
<i>Now, when we say that, bear in mind
that we're huge fans of yours.</i>

58:12.556 --> 58:14.581
-- <i>Yes...absolutely.</i>
-- <i>We appreciate the style,</i>

58:14.658 --> 58:17.491
<i>but you got to remember that not
everyone is as smart as we are.</i>

58:17.561 --> 58:20.121
<i>And we would like you guys to
write the show more like, who?</i>

58:20.197 --> 58:22.063
Keith and Kenny
are a good example.

58:22.133 --> 58:23.965
-- Yes. -- Or Craig. -- Yeah.

58:24.034 --> 58:26.969
<i>Now, we've been sending you the
scripts, and we've been writing notes,</i>

58:27.037 --> 58:28.232
<i>and we've been talking to you
till we're blue in the face --</i>

58:28.305 --> 58:30.399
-- They've been trying.
-- No, they haven't, Dana.

58:30.474 --> 58:31.464
Yes, they have.

58:31.542 --> 58:35.410
I'd like to continue this meeting in my
office, please. This isn't fair to the staff.

58:35.479 --> 58:38.779
<i>We find that when we give the notes to you,
they don't make their way to the staff.</i>

58:38.849 --> 58:40.283
That's not true.
She always --

58:40.351 --> 58:42.251
J.J., Dan and Casey are
professional writers,

58:42.319 --> 58:43.878
they're not waiters
in a restaurant.

58:43.954 --> 58:45.479
You can't tell them
what you'd like

58:45.556 --> 58:46.921
and how you'd like it prepared.

58:46.991 --> 58:49.358
This show is bought and paid for
by my network, Dana.

58:49.426 --> 58:51.326
That is exactly what I can do.

58:51.395 --> 58:53.921
I'll ask you again -- please, let's
have this meeting in my office.

58:53.998 --> 58:55.727
And I am telling you
we're past that.

58:55.800 --> 58:58.098
J.J., I was hoping this meeting
would go differently.

58:58.169 --> 59:00.797
I was prepared to eat whatever
I had to for Isaac's sake.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.703
And I asked the senior staff
to do the same,

59:02.773 --> 59:06.437
which, by the way, is the only reason why Dan,
Casey, Jeremy, Elliott, Chris, Will, and Dave

59:06.510 --> 59:08.069
haven't beaten the crap
out of you guys by now.

59:08.179 --> 59:09.340
I've changed my mind!

59:09.380 --> 59:11.405
At this point,
you have two choices --

59:11.482 --> 59:14.076
fire me or shut the hell up!

59:14.151 --> 59:17.883
<i>Dana, sad to say that your attitude
over these past three years</i>

59:17.955 --> 59:21.482
combined with these totally unacceptable
ratings make that a very easy choice.

59:21.559 --> 59:22.492
Hang on.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.654
-- Look -- <i>What?
Casey: Yeah...</i>

59:24.728 --> 59:27.322
We can try harder.

59:27.398 --> 59:28.331
Danny.

59:28.399 --> 59:29.195
We can.

59:29.266 --> 59:31.701
Nobody needs to lose their job
over this.

59:32.970 --> 59:34.734
We can try harder.

59:36.440 --> 59:39.137
Let's get to the rest
of the notes.

59:40.244 --> 59:42.178
Get to the rest of the notes.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.680
Turning to page --

59:43.747 --> 59:44.976
<i>Dana." Let's take five.</i>

59:45.049 --> 59:46.539
<i>J.J..' Dana.</i>

59:46.617 --> 59:47.982
Please.

59:48.052 --> 59:49.747
We're getting through
these notes.

59:49.820 --> 59:52.221
Do what you want, but for five minutes
you'll be talking to an empty room.

59:52.289 --> 59:53.620
Let's take five.

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:03.900
Unbelievable.

01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:06.665
I'm losing my patience
for this, J.J.

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:08.000
-- Hey.
-- Hey, Sam.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.163
How's it going?

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:10.970
It's going fine.

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:15.179
I'm sorry...is it Jim-Bob?

01:00:15.246 --> 01:00:15.906
J.J.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.277
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

01:00:17.348 --> 01:00:19.715
-- I thought it was Jim-Bob.
-- No.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:21.581
-- Take a walk with me, will you?
-- Where?

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:23.677
It's a surprise.

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:27.088
[indistinct voices,
telephones ringing]

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:31.190
You guys know
who Philo Farnsworth was?

01:00:31.262 --> 01:00:32.787
-- Philo Farnsworth?
-- Yeah.

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:33.796
What's going on?

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.195
He invented television.

01:00:35.266 --> 01:00:38.099
I don't mean he invented
television like Uncle Milty.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:40.432
I mean he invented
the television

01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:42.472
in a little house
in Provo, Utah,

01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:46.169
at a time when the idea of transmitting
moving pictures through the air

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:48.610
would be like me saying
I figured out a way

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:51.080
<i>to beam</i> us <i>aboard
the starship Enterprise.</i>

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.116
-- Yeah, look, I-| --
-- He was a visionary.

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:54.844
He died broke
and without fanfare.

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:56.444
The guy I really like, though,

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.318
was his brother-in-law,
Cliff Gardner.

01:00:58.389 --> 01:01:00.585
He said, "Philo, I know
everyone thinks you're crazy,

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:02.092
"but I want to be
a part of this.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.752
"I don't have your head
for science,

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.556
"so I'm not going to be able
to help much

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:07.927
"with the design and the
mechanics of the invention,

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.592
but it sounds like you're
going to need glass tubes."

01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:15.500
-- J.J., I-l don't think -- -- You see,
Philo was inventing the cathode receptor,

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:17.973
and even though Cliff didn't know
what that meant or how it worked,

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:19.771
he'd seen Philo's drawing,

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.811
and he knew that he was gonna
need glass tubes.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:23.973
And since television
hadn't been invented yet,

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:26.915
it's not like you could get them
at the local TV repair shop.

01:01:26.984 --> 01:01:28.884
"I want to be a part
of this," Cliff said.

01:01:28.953 --> 01:01:30.614
"I don't have your head
for science.

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:34.955
“How would it be if I were to teach
myself to be a glass blower?

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:37.858
"And I could set up
a little shop in the backyard.

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:41.057
And I could make all the tubes
you'll need for testing."

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:44.658
There ought to be Congressional
Medals for people like that.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:48.103
-- Maybe so -- -- I've looked
over the notes you've been giving

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:51.198
over the last year or so,
and I have to say they exhibit

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:53.243
an almost total lack
of understanding

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.677
of how to get the best
from talented people.

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:56.736
Excuse me, but --

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.873
You said before
that for whatever reason,

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:01.509
<i>I seem to be able to exert
some authority around here.</i>

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:05.146
I assure you it's not
'cause they like me.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.451
It's 'cause they knew

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.423
two minutes after
I walked in the door

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:10.516
<i>I'm someone who knows
how to do something.</i>

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:12.029
I can help.

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:14.690
I can make glass tubes.

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:16.426
That's what they need.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.361
One last thing --

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:22.337
the first and last
decision-making authority

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.374
on this show will rest
with Isaac Jaffee

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.910
until Isaac Jaffee
says otherwise,

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:29.503
and if you disrespect him
in my presence again,

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.605
I will rededicate
the rest of my life

01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:33.480
to ruining the rest of yours.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.178
And if you think
I'm just mouthing at you,

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.119
you should ask around about me.

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:41.920
I have absolutely no conscience
about these things.

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:43.926
Sam, why did you
bring us out here?

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:47.396
Because there's the exit.
That's it.

01:02:47.464 --> 01:02:48.954
The meeting's over.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.613
<i>Isaac: You're a lunatic,
you know that?</i>

01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:09.683
You were watching?

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:10.914
The color test.

01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:12.149
Yeah, well...

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.623
<i>You should have said it
in front of them.</i>

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:16.819
It's not what I do.

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.589
Okay.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:23.493
What happened to these people?

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:25.160
Someone want to go look
for them?

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:29.202
-- <i>Where's J.J.?</i>
-- <i>They're gone.</i>

01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:31.435
I don't have to like you.
You don't have to like me.

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:32.737
<i>I have two priorities.</i>

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.835
<i>The first is getting
from the beginning of the day</i>

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.710
to the end of the day
without having a drink.

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.772
The second is raising
this show's ratings

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:41.784
to the point
where it's no longer in danger

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:44.014
of what almost happened
here today.

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:48.120
<i>Trust me.</i>

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:50.854
I won't make fools out of you.

01:03:57.701 --> 01:04:01.194
Well...let's go do the show.

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:17.144
<i>On the next "Sports Night"...</i>

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:18.052
-- Hello!
-- Ah!

01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:19.419
Why are you reading my mail?

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:21.254
Since when have you been
corresponding with my sister?

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:23.316
Do you know what this week's
Internet-poll question is?

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.760
Who's cooler -- Dan or Casey?

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:28.696
You're winning -- 153 to 6.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:29.823
I want to bury him.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.925
-- I could get in trouble.
-- This is what men do, Jeremy.

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:34.869
There's such a thing
as team morale.

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:36.372
Not that big on morale.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.101
-- Not as crazy as Dana coming back
from dinner without her panties.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.973
-- What?
-- Hmm?
