- Hey.
- Yeah.

00:44.161 --> 00:46.396
Pop?

00:46.397 --> 00:47.797
Yeah?

00:47.798 --> 00:49.366
Why the long face?

00:49.367 --> 00:51.100
What does that mean?

00:51.101 --> 00:52.869
What?

00:52.870 --> 00:54.303
Why the long face?

00:54.304 --> 00:56.272
When are you going to be British?

00:56.273 --> 00:57.807
You've been here 25 years.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.777
What does it mean, long face?

01:00.778 --> 01:03.414
Why so blue?

01:04.581 --> 01:06.749
I have a task.

01:06.750 --> 01:09.018
I have some work this year.

01:09.019 --> 01:10.854
So, what?

01:12.690 --> 01:14.624
It involves your brother.

01:14.625 --> 01:18.761
I'll need your help, Kkyman.

01:18.762 --> 01:23.900
I'm going to ask a good deal from you.

01:23.901 --> 01:25.935
It seems.

01:25.936 --> 01:29.339
This year, Kkyman.

01:36.313 --> 01:39.382
Thanks for having a cold one with me, man.

01:39.383 --> 01:42.084
Sorry I'm a bring down right now.

01:42.085 --> 01:44.921
But, I'm blue, man.

01:44.922 --> 01:46.322
Yeah?

01:46.323 --> 01:48.224
I'm fucked up.

01:48.225 --> 01:49.892
My brother, man.

01:49.893 --> 01:53.295
He was messed up.

01:53.296 --> 01:55.164
Little messed up from stuff.

01:55.165 --> 01:57.299
I came here to help him.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.035
But now he's gone.

01:59.036 --> 02:02.071
He's missing.

02:02.072 --> 02:05.508
It's fucked up.

02:05.509 --> 02:07.209
You have a brother?

02:07.210 --> 02:09.311
Or a sister or something?

02:09.312 --> 02:11.213
A brother, yeah.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.950
It's fucked up.

02:13.951 --> 02:18.387
Yeah. Yeah, that would be fucked up.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.557
Blue.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.625
It doesn't readily appear in nature.

02:22.626 --> 02:25.127
Blueberries, maybe.

02:25.128 --> 02:27.296
Bluebirds.

02:27.297 --> 02:29.699
But not much else really.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.701
You know, the ocean's not really blue.

02:31.702 --> 02:36.005
Nor is the sky. Nor me.

02:36.006 --> 02:38.441
Ever, really.

02:38.442 --> 02:41.410
Till now.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.846
I feel so weird.

02:46.016 --> 02:50.454
Let me put some of those up,
on my way back to the hotel.

02:55.659 --> 02:57.460
You gonna be okay?

02:57.461 --> 02:59.462
Hey, man.

02:59.463 --> 03:01.030
Just knowing you cared...

03:01.031 --> 03:04.400
just knowing you cared enough
to stop and have a cold one?

03:04.401 --> 03:05.969
That's something.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.639
Be cool.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.674
I can't not be.

03:11.675 --> 03:14.544
I can't not be either.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.268
How can you say?

03:39.269 --> 03:40.703
For certain.

03:40.704 --> 03:43.206
I can say. For certain.

03:44.942 --> 03:47.545
I need you to finish his work.

03:49.580 --> 03:51.014
What was it?

03:54.217 --> 03:55.218
Tell me.

03:58.689 --> 04:01.091
There was a bag...

05:10.794 --> 05:12.595
Luxembourg is the money-laundering

05:12.596 --> 05:14.096
capital of the world.

05:14.097 --> 05:16.432
We allow business to be
transacted among countries

05:16.433 --> 05:18.801
and parties who are
banned from doing business

05:18.802 --> 05:20.169
together elsewhere.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.772
Every 9th businessman in Luxembourg

05:22.773 --> 05:24.907
conducts business under an assumed name.

05:24.908 --> 05:29.879
Every 9th bag trafficked
through the airport holds cash.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.782
A guest at the King Gerald
wrote down the address

05:32.783 --> 05:35.484
of the murder victim on this paper

05:35.485 --> 05:37.053
the evening of the murder

05:37.054 --> 05:39.521
on baggage handling time cards

05:39.522 --> 05:41.624
where the foreman was assaulted.

05:41.625 --> 05:44.861
It's clear that
someone well-to-do,

05:44.862 --> 05:47.764
someone staying at the
expensive King Gerald,

05:47.765 --> 05:50.166
intersected with private baggage

05:50.167 --> 05:52.201
at the Luxembourg City airport.

05:52.202 --> 05:56.538
The brother of our murder
victim works handling bags.

05:56.539 --> 05:58.875
I surmise

05:58.876 --> 06:01.410
Edgar Barros discovered a sum of money

06:01.411 --> 06:03.345
in a passenger's checked luggage.

06:03.346 --> 06:06.916
This passenger, flying
under an assumed name,

06:06.917 --> 06:09.686
sought him out that
evening, fought for the bag

06:09.687 --> 06:12.822
at the Barros apartment,
at 77 de Champlain,

06:12.823 --> 06:15.491
to the extent of which a man died.

06:15.492 --> 06:17.994
I have interviewed each guest of

06:17.995 --> 06:20.596
the King Gerald that evening, but one:

06:20.597 --> 06:23.265
John Lakeman.

06:23.266 --> 06:26.703
He abruptly left our
scheduled interview session.

06:26.704 --> 06:30.272
His whereabouts at the time
of the murder are undetermined.

06:30.273 --> 06:34.243
His colleague stipulated that
he missed an essential meeting

06:34.244 --> 06:38.080
because his airline misplaced his bag.

06:38.081 --> 06:40.216
John Lakeman is at the center

06:40.217 --> 06:42.719
of an unusual circle of violence

06:42.720 --> 06:46.288
on an unusually violent
night in Luxembourg.

06:46.289 --> 06:49.826
Additionally, John
Lakeman phoned, upon a time

06:49.827 --> 06:51.928
during which every other member of his

06:51.929 --> 06:54.130
professional traveling
party phoned their wives,

06:54.131 --> 06:56.665
a woman named Alice Taylor,

06:56.666 --> 06:58.467
who is married to a man

06:58.468 --> 07:01.470
who is working as a
quote unquote "consultant"

07:01.471 --> 07:04.106
to an intelligence gathering department

07:04.107 --> 07:06.175
of the United States government.

07:06.176 --> 07:10.446
I respectfully submit my request
to interview John Lakeman,

07:10.447 --> 07:13.182
in the third party country
of the United States,

07:13.183 --> 07:18.855
on the date of May 22nd, tomorrow, 2012.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.858
Concerning the appeal of Luxembourg City,

07:21.859 --> 07:23.492
of the country of Luxembourg,

07:23.493 --> 07:27.430
the court provides its
approval to interrogate.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.624
Hey.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.359
She's coming. Approved.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.829
Just now. She's probably on her way.

07:59.830 --> 08:02.364
My guess, she shows up
tomorrow. They show up at work.

08:02.365 --> 08:03.599
It's safer.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.403
I found the book.
Structural Dynamics of Flow.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.504
Where?

08:08.505 --> 08:09.939
The guy with the girl's name.

08:09.940 --> 08:12.474
- No shit?
- No. Yeah.

08:12.475 --> 08:14.210
Get it to Edward, John.

08:14.211 --> 08:16.946
I may want you out of there.
I may pull you out of there.

08:16.947 --> 08:18.747
Today. Before she comes.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.149
Cool.

08:20.150 --> 08:21.851
I'm gathering some information.

08:21.852 --> 08:22.885
I'll reach back out to you today.

08:22.886 --> 08:23.886
Okay.

08:23.887 --> 08:25.521
She's good.

08:25.522 --> 08:28.457
She was cited this week for
two instances of child neglect

08:28.458 --> 08:31.060
for leaving her daughter
alone in her apartment.

08:31.061 --> 08:33.895
Her kid's seeing things.
The neighbors narced.

08:33.897 --> 08:37.299
So... she's really cramming
in the hours on your case.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.936
She's not a bad mom, I'm guessing;

08:39.937 --> 08:42.038
I'm guessing she's just a good cop.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.505
What does she have on you?

08:43.506 --> 08:44.907
I don't know.

08:44.908 --> 08:47.409
Her daughter drew a picture of me.

08:47.410 --> 08:49.145
It's pretty good.

08:49.146 --> 08:50.512
I pull you out of there today,

08:50.513 --> 08:53.349
she shows up, John Lakeman's a ghost.

08:53.350 --> 08:55.151
Okay.

08:55.152 --> 08:56.953
Midnight.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.455
Hey, maybe it's time to come home.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.491
Okay.

09:05.395 --> 09:06.896
How we doing with that paperwork, John?

09:06.897 --> 09:07.930
Not as yet.

09:07.931 --> 09:09.498
Clock's ticking.

09:09.499 --> 09:11.068
For sure.

09:16.506 --> 09:19.475
John? I'd like to share
my demands with you.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.043
Yeah?

09:21.044 --> 09:25.547
John, what do you know about
non-sexual, same-sex cuddling?

09:25.548 --> 09:26.815
Nothing.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.250
Well, that's what I want to do.

09:28.251 --> 09:29.751
Yeah?

09:29.752 --> 09:32.389
Yeah, I demand it.

09:34.524 --> 09:36.426
Okay, more soon.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.629
- See ya.
- See ya.

09:40.630 --> 09:42.965
Hey, John. How we doing?

09:42.966 --> 09:44.466
Pretty good.

09:44.467 --> 09:47.703
Hey, thanks for killing those birds.

09:47.704 --> 09:49.471
Yeah.

09:49.472 --> 09:51.640
Hey, so I'm making the
rounds, letting McMillan

09:51.641 --> 09:53.375
know we're bankrupt pretty much

09:53.376 --> 09:56.946
and I've turned essentially
all my authority over to Leslie.

09:56.947 --> 09:58.014
Okay.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.148
Big announcement tomorrow.

09:59.149 --> 10:00.516
Then we're all going to pitch in,

10:00.517 --> 10:03.085
right the ship and secure
that Denon deal. Right?

10:03.086 --> 10:05.787
Then the future's so bright
we'll have to wear shades.

10:05.788 --> 10:08.091
Cool.

10:12.662 --> 10:13.662
Sir?

10:13.663 --> 10:15.464
Yeah?

10:15.465 --> 10:17.599
Stephen remembers you being in
the vicinity of his accident.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.536
Can you help shed some
light on his final moments?

10:20.537 --> 10:21.971
Not really.

10:21.972 --> 10:25.074
You seem to have, um,
an indifferent attitude

10:25.075 --> 10:26.675
towards Stephen's recovery.

10:26.676 --> 10:29.145
Can I share with you why it's so important

10:29.146 --> 10:30.579
that he have full recollection,

10:30.580 --> 10:31.914
including his accident?

10:31.915 --> 10:37.453
Humor requires your
entire whole full being.

10:37.454 --> 10:40.389
Stephen is incomplete, he'll
never regain his sense of humor.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.790
If he doesn't regain his sense of humor,

10:41.791 --> 10:43.292
he'll never laugh.

10:43.293 --> 10:46.595
And no one will ever love him.

10:46.596 --> 10:48.364
That's pretty heavy.

10:48.365 --> 10:50.499
Yeah. It is.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.001
So get with it.

10:52.002 --> 10:53.602
For sure.

10:53.603 --> 10:58.174
You sound "not all in." FYI, I'm a fighter.

10:58.175 --> 11:00.776
And I am fighting for these memories.

11:00.777 --> 11:03.045
So, are you on my team?

11:03.046 --> 11:05.581
Count me in.

11:05.582 --> 11:09.618
Hey, just wanted to give
you an update about my life.

11:09.619 --> 11:11.620
You ever stay in the kind of a shitty hotel

11:11.621 --> 11:14.356
that has the TV and
it's chained to the wall?

11:14.357 --> 11:16.258
Well, that's where I live now.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.094
And I look at it, and
I think even if I could

11:18.095 --> 11:20.796
get the TV off the chain,
I couldn't steal it,

11:20.797 --> 11:22.731
because I have nowhere to take it

11:22.732 --> 11:24.134
because I have no home now.

11:29.706 --> 11:32.541
Hey, John. We got an e-mail.

11:32.542 --> 11:33.909
It was for you.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.311
It was from a foreign policewoman.

11:35.312 --> 11:36.945
She's gonna interview you tomorrow.

11:36.946 --> 11:37.946
Take care.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.287
Hey.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.624
Stay there. No matter what happens.

11:49.492 --> 11:51.527
I pull you out of there today,

11:51.528 --> 11:54.496
she shows up, John Lakeman's a ghost.

11:54.497 --> 11:56.232
Okay.

11:56.233 --> 12:00.836
Hey, maybe it's time to come home.

12:00.837 --> 12:03.140
Okay.

12:05.575 --> 12:06.575
Anything, Tim?

12:06.576 --> 12:07.376
Yeah.

12:07.377 --> 12:08.710
We picked up a phone call...

12:08.711 --> 12:11.280
It's a conversation between an unknown male

12:11.281 --> 12:15.351
and the wife of your Egyptian
physicist Mohamed El-Mashad.

12:15.352 --> 12:19.055
She was told to remain in
Luxembourg until the 27th,

12:19.056 --> 12:21.957
and then take a bag from them at 3:00 PM

12:21.958 --> 12:23.525
at the Bettborn Station.

12:23.526 --> 12:25.194
They said they'd have the bag?

12:25.195 --> 12:26.662
- Then?
- Yeah.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.665
And the Japanese girl? Well, she's 23.

12:29.666 --> 12:33.102
She's a student at the
Luxembourg School for the Arts.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.571
That's all. That's all she is.

12:35.572 --> 12:38.874
She got arrested for stealing a dog leash.

12:38.875 --> 12:39.975
Somebody's dog?

12:39.976 --> 12:42.278
Just the leash.

12:42.279 --> 12:43.279
That's weird.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.447
Yeah, I don't know.

12:45.448 --> 12:49.418
She's being released from
the Luxembourg Police Station

12:49.419 --> 12:52.121
at the same date and time
they mentioned to the woman.

12:52.122 --> 12:55.357
To El-Mashed. Just an hour earlier.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.459
She got a five day sentence.

12:57.460 --> 13:00.829
Sounds about right for
a dog leash, I guess.

13:00.830 --> 13:02.598
Anyway, she'll be let go.

13:02.599 --> 13:05.167
She'll get her belongings
back and be let go

13:05.168 --> 13:06.935
at the date and time they mentioned

13:06.936 --> 13:10.572
they can get the bag to
the physicist's wife. Right?

13:10.573 --> 13:13.675
They're going to take the
bag from that little girl.

13:13.676 --> 13:15.644
So, get there first.

13:15.645 --> 13:18.947
Here's your chance to
ravel it back in, Tom.

13:18.948 --> 13:20.349
I like your odds.

13:20.350 --> 13:22.451
All your man has to do is get the bag back

13:22.452 --> 13:25.921
from a 23-year-old
Japanese puppeteer.

13:25.922 --> 13:28.224
A puppeteer? What?

13:28.225 --> 13:30.058
Puppetry. She's a puppeteer.

13:30.059 --> 13:34.363
Student. Straight A's.

13:34.364 --> 13:38.534
Yeah. That's all he has to do.

13:38.535 --> 13:40.902
Jesus Christ. Could it
really be that simple?

13:45.842 --> 13:47.042
Thanks, Tim.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.378
You can have a heart attack now.

13:49.379 --> 13:51.481
Fuck you, buddy.

13:57.154 --> 13:58.287
Hey?

13:58.288 --> 14:00.189
Stay there. No matter what happens.

14:00.190 --> 14:03.925
Stay and fend off whatever
comes at you this week.

14:03.926 --> 14:08.198
We're going to get it all
back on the 27th, John.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.695
Can't we just do it the cafeteria, Brent?

14:39.696 --> 14:41.963
I think doing Fellowship in the cafeteria

14:41.964 --> 14:43.565
makes some people uncomfortable.

14:43.566 --> 14:44.866
It's a government building.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.168
It sucks in here.

14:46.169 --> 14:47.436
You know what doesn't suck, Andy?

14:47.437 --> 14:49.739
- What?
- The Constitution.

14:53.343 --> 14:55.812
Okay, hi.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.781
Now let us join hands and walk like Christ

14:59.782 --> 15:01.251
in grace and love.

15:26.909 --> 15:28.577
Can I just say...

15:28.578 --> 15:31.079
very clever to orient this exercise

15:31.080 --> 15:33.148
around Stephen's favorite movie.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.483
It keeps it personal,

15:34.484 --> 15:37.253
and yet adds an important touch of fun.

15:37.254 --> 15:39.655
I think we're in a good place with this.

15:39.656 --> 15:41.189
It's really come along, Ally.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.024
You've really come a long way, son.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.626
Thanks Leslie, to you.

15:44.627 --> 15:47.162
You kept me regularly
focused on my recovery.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.565
Well, you did all the heavy lifting, kid.

15:49.566 --> 15:52.234
Well, as the Wolf says
in my favorite movie,

15:52.235 --> 15:53.735
"Pulp Fiction", let's not start

15:53.736 --> 15:57.239
sucking each other's dicks quite yet.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.941
- Wow.
- Wow.

15:59.942 --> 16:01.978
Show us what you got.

18:07.136 --> 18:09.304
You got what you wanted, man.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.507
Why am I here?

18:11.508 --> 18:12.574
We're not done yet.

18:12.575 --> 18:14.342
I did my part.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.378
What were you gonna do to me

18:16.379 --> 18:19.347
with your stupid tree branch?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.349
Brutalize you.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.552
Break all the bones in your face

18:23.553 --> 18:27.288
to signal to you what I'm willing to do

18:27.289 --> 18:29.726
to continue the job I'm doing.

18:30.460 --> 18:34.564
John, how dark are you?

18:36.533 --> 18:39.034
If I blow the whistle, the job you're on...

18:39.035 --> 18:43.539
it's over.

18:43.540 --> 18:47.609
Well, you can keep doing
the job you're doing,

18:47.610 --> 18:49.812
if you do one last thing for me.

18:51.180 --> 18:53.715
Do what?

18:53.716 --> 18:58.488
Tomorrow, some time
during the day, at work...

18:59.422 --> 19:01.390
Kill me.

19:15.304 --> 19:17.573
People think I'm stupid.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.676
Maybe it's my face.

19:20.677 --> 19:24.179
Name doesn't help, I guess.

19:24.180 --> 19:26.548
You know?

19:26.549 --> 19:28.618
Do I look stupid?

19:30.453 --> 19:33.221
I've never really looked at you.

19:33.222 --> 19:35.757
Well, people think I'm stupid.

19:35.758 --> 19:40.428
I had a period when I was a policeman,

19:40.429 --> 19:43.799
I'd try to show off,
I'm embarrassed to say,

19:43.800 --> 19:49.037
by using a large and
unnecessary vocabulary.

19:49.038 --> 19:54.209
I had the habit of drinking, too.

19:54.210 --> 19:57.879
One morning, I was in my car.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.116
4:30 in the morning. I'm drunk.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.885
I'm playing Scrabble.

20:03.886 --> 20:07.989
Call comes, Latino purse
snatcher on my street.

20:07.990 --> 20:13.061
Latino blurs by my window.
Bag on his shoulder.

20:13.062 --> 20:16.598
I get out. I draw.

20:16.599 --> 20:18.834
I yell "halt."

20:18.835 --> 20:21.704
He reaches into his bag, I shoot.

20:23.072 --> 20:25.173
I come up on him.

20:25.174 --> 20:28.209
Paperboy.

20:28.210 --> 20:30.780
Retard.

20:35.117 --> 20:37.853
14.

20:37.854 --> 20:39.821
Not 9, like people say,

20:39.822 --> 20:44.994
but, 14. Just 14.

20:47.396 --> 20:53.502
I couldn't just yell "stop"
like anyone else, you know?

20:55.838 --> 21:01.409
My friends, cops, came and swept my car.

21:01.410 --> 21:02.779
They swapped my blood.

21:03.813 --> 21:06.114
What did I put in the box?

21:06.115 --> 21:09.084
Drunk blood. Mine.

21:09.085 --> 21:13.221
I wasn't trying to be found innocent, John.

21:13.222 --> 21:16.258
I was trying to be found guilty.

21:17.927 --> 21:20.228
Wrongful death convictions,

21:20.229 --> 21:23.632
the civil settlements
are 400 percent greater.

21:23.633 --> 21:25.533
I wanted that family to have something.

21:27.469 --> 21:29.838
Then this judge lets me off.

21:29.839 --> 21:32.741
Thought he was helping me out. Yeah.

21:32.742 --> 21:34.776
In the last 20 years,

21:34.777 --> 21:37.545
17 police officers have
been charged for killings

21:37.546 --> 21:39.948
for incidents that happened on the job

21:39.949 --> 21:42.684
in the U.S. None convicted.

21:42.685 --> 21:46.454
The system's bent, I guess.

21:46.455 --> 21:50.258
Anyway, my insurance expires tomorrow.

21:50.259 --> 21:52.527
Yeah. So kill me at work.

21:52.528 --> 21:56.665
'Cause that's another 75,000
for getting killed on the job.

21:56.666 --> 21:59.434
It's in my stupid security guard contract,

21:59.435 --> 22:02.671
because it never happens.

22:02.672 --> 22:04.673
Kill you how?

22:04.674 --> 22:07.909
Just whack me in my stupid fucking head.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.378
Do your tree branch thing.

22:10.379 --> 22:13.215
Just go a little darker, John.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.919
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:17.920 --> 22:19.655
due to mechanical difficulties

22:19.656 --> 22:20.856
we'll have to return to the gate.

22:20.857 --> 22:22.390
Thank you for your patience

22:22.391 --> 22:24.794
and we'll do out best
to get you to Milwaukee.

22:43.980 --> 22:45.280
Hey.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.984
Hello.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.058
Hey, are you okay?

22:57.059 --> 22:59.560
Yes.

22:59.561 --> 23:01.830
I'm...

23:01.831 --> 23:04.833
Actually, I've never done this before.

23:04.834 --> 23:08.704
Rented a car in America.

23:08.705 --> 23:10.405
Or driven a car in America.

23:10.406 --> 23:11.639
Where are you driving?

23:11.640 --> 23:12.908
- Milwaukee.
- It's short.

23:12.909 --> 23:14.342
It's just a...

23:14.343 --> 23:16.511
It's a straight line. You'll be fine.

23:16.512 --> 23:19.247
Where are you driving?

23:19.248 --> 23:20.849
Same.

23:20.850 --> 23:23.686
It's just, um, it's
an hour-and-a-half.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.227
Next.

23:32.228 --> 23:34.830
I would like to rent a car please.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.998
Are you returning the vehicle
to its point of origin?

23:36.999 --> 23:39.768
What is this point?

23:39.769 --> 23:42.270
Of origin.

23:42.271 --> 23:43.338
Its return.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.874
Um, she just wants to know

23:45.875 --> 23:47.675
if you'll be returning the car here.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.676
After your trip.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.746
Yes. Thank you.

23:50.747 --> 23:52.347
In-state travel?

23:52.348 --> 23:53.882
In-state?

23:53.883 --> 23:56.551
No. Milwaukee.

23:56.552 --> 23:59.755
Yes, I am bound for
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

23:59.756 --> 24:02.391
Can I see your drivers license please?

24:05.194 --> 24:08.696
Where's this from? Is this a country?

24:08.697 --> 24:09.765
Yes.

24:09.766 --> 24:11.699
I've never heard of it.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.102
Well, it is one.

24:14.103 --> 24:18.474
- One what?
- One country.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.351
Hi, um...

24:32.789 --> 24:34.890
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.958
What are you doing?

24:36.959 --> 24:38.960
Working on my bearings.

24:38.961 --> 24:40.728
What are you doing in Milwaukee?

24:40.729 --> 24:43.299
Traveling. For work.

24:45.367 --> 24:47.369
Do you want a ride?

24:50.106 --> 24:51.973
Why are you going to Milwaukee?

24:51.974 --> 24:54.944
I'm visiting someone.

24:56.212 --> 24:57.846
Why are you?

24:57.847 --> 24:59.447
I'm interviewing someone.

24:59.448 --> 25:01.416
For what? For a job?

25:01.417 --> 25:02.417
No...

25:08.858 --> 25:10.558
That's not cool.

25:10.559 --> 25:11.860
Yeah.

25:11.861 --> 25:13.461
Just a little wave. That's all it takes.

25:13.462 --> 25:16.164
Yeah, I invented an app that...

25:16.165 --> 25:19.000
you aim at them and it tells you
if they're going to thank you.

25:19.001 --> 25:21.202
Why didn't you use it?

25:21.203 --> 25:23.404
Well, cause I didn't actually invent it

25:23.405 --> 25:25.740
because I don't know anything
about that kind of stuff.

25:25.741 --> 25:28.643
I just invented it in my mind.

25:28.644 --> 25:29.945
Well, anyway,

25:29.946 --> 25:33.414
if you ever actually
invent one, I'll buy one.

25:33.415 --> 25:34.516
Thanks.

25:37.920 --> 25:42.190
I invent stuff that I
don't really invent, too.

25:42.191 --> 25:44.126
Like what?

25:53.535 --> 25:55.370
What?

25:55.371 --> 25:56.737
Nothing.

25:56.738 --> 25:58.073
What?

25:58.074 --> 26:01.676
I just didn't expect you
to throw it like that.

26:01.677 --> 26:03.111
In that way.

26:03.112 --> 26:05.113
I'm just a little surprised.

26:05.114 --> 26:08.918
Well, I'm throwing with my left hand.

26:10.619 --> 26:11.786
Why?

26:11.787 --> 26:14.555
Because I have to be left handed today.

26:14.556 --> 26:16.091
Why?

26:16.092 --> 26:19.494
Because someone's coming
to interview me today.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.828
Fuck.

26:20.829 --> 26:24.966
So you summoned me here just
to practice being left-handed?

26:24.967 --> 26:27.302
Yeah.

26:27.303 --> 26:29.204
Why do you have to do it all day?

26:29.205 --> 26:32.307
Because I think she's just
going to appear in the office.

26:32.308 --> 26:33.641
Like last time.

26:33.642 --> 26:36.644
And if she appears and
I'm like, in that moment,

26:36.645 --> 26:41.017
pouring coffee with my
right hand, I'm fucked.

26:43.619 --> 26:45.954
Fuck.

26:45.955 --> 26:48.624
Should be an interesting day.

26:52.428 --> 26:53.794
Fuck.

26:53.795 --> 26:55.763
Fat Face?

26:55.764 --> 26:57.332
Yeah. Fat Face.

26:57.333 --> 27:00.168
So it's an image of your face?

27:00.169 --> 27:02.170
Yes, it's an image of your face

27:02.171 --> 27:04.172
on the refrigerator.

27:04.173 --> 27:07.375
And then when you select items
from your fridge like ice cream,

27:07.376 --> 27:10.245
your face on the fridge gets fatter...

27:10.246 --> 27:13.281
so it will show you what you
would look like, if you ate

27:13.282 --> 27:15.716
that amount of ice cream for a year.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.885
- That's great.
- Thanks.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.055
That's a great non-invention.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.590
Yeah. Fat Face.

27:22.591 --> 27:24.592
It doesn't exist.

27:24.593 --> 27:28.629
What's the name of your
app that doesn't exist?

27:28.630 --> 27:32.534
I've been calling it Cool
Guy or Douche I guess.

27:35.637 --> 27:36.871
Yeah, that's good.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.975
Yeah?

28:43.872 --> 28:45.906
One, two, three...

28:45.907 --> 28:47.143
Kramer.

29:19.941 --> 29:21.242
Thanks.

29:21.243 --> 29:23.411
Come on. You have been so gracious.

29:23.412 --> 29:25.146
You're a guest here. No way.

29:25.147 --> 29:26.647
- I insist.
- So do I.

29:26.648 --> 29:30.818
- Seriously.
- I'm serious, too.

29:30.819 --> 29:32.687
Rochambeau?

29:32.688 --> 29:34.556
Yeah, okay.

29:45.667 --> 29:47.268
You're pretty good.

29:47.269 --> 29:49.104
I work with kids.

29:49.105 --> 29:50.371
We sort things out like this a lot.

29:50.372 --> 29:52.006
- You are a teacher?
- Yeah.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.475
Well, you're right.

29:54.476 --> 29:56.811
People think this is a game of chance.

29:56.812 --> 29:58.413
But it's a game of skill.

29:58.414 --> 30:00.681
If someone has experience regarding people,

30:00.682 --> 30:02.783
reading people, like a job like yours,

30:02.784 --> 30:04.320
they can excel at it.

30:07.656 --> 30:09.390
Very good.

30:09.391 --> 30:14.195
You've made it further than
anyone I think I've ever played.

30:14.196 --> 30:16.332
Now I can take the bill.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.787
It is good.

30:39.788 --> 30:43.191
Yeah.

30:43.192 --> 30:46.127
I feel like I've heard it before, it's...

30:46.128 --> 30:47.562
I don't know...

30:59.040 --> 31:00.708
Here's my e-mail.

31:00.709 --> 31:02.977
Send me yours and I'll give
you the name of that album.

31:02.978 --> 31:04.345
Cool, I'll write you later.

31:04.346 --> 31:07.348
I'm kind of excited. To go.

31:07.349 --> 31:08.349
Where are you meeting your friend?

31:08.350 --> 31:10.251
At his work.

31:10.252 --> 31:11.986
Do you need a ride?

31:11.987 --> 31:13.154
No. Thank you.

31:13.155 --> 31:14.289
I'll take a cab.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.723
You've been so helpful already.

31:15.724 --> 31:17.659
I don't want to take more of your time.

33:13.174 --> 33:14.709
Hey, Chicago.

33:14.710 --> 33:15.676
Sorry?

33:15.677 --> 33:18.178
This is the executive parking section.

33:18.179 --> 33:20.247
For executives.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.082
F.Y.I., Chicago.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.151
I'm sorry.

33:24.152 --> 33:26.722
No big deal, Chicago.

34:50.739 --> 34:52.473
- Dennis?
- Yeah?

34:52.474 --> 34:54.610
I need your help.

34:56.311 --> 34:57.879
Okay.

34:59.815 --> 35:02.517
- He's right inside.
- I can't go inside.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.485
I'm not even supposed to be here.

35:04.486 --> 35:08.856
Will you just tell him?

35:08.857 --> 35:10.726
Yeah, sure.

35:11.627 --> 35:12.693
How did you even, like,

35:12.694 --> 35:16.363
find me or know about me?

35:16.364 --> 35:19.299
He wrote a song about you.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.068
I mean it wasn't about you,

35:21.069 --> 35:24.505
it was about how he wants to kill himself.

35:24.506 --> 35:27.642
But in it he said

35:27.643 --> 35:30.645
that there was one cool
thing about where he was and

35:30.646 --> 35:33.514
that was he made friends with
a guy at work named Dennis.

35:33.515 --> 35:36.418
And I looked you up on the company website.

35:41.490 --> 35:43.724
Thank you for joining us this morning.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.392
This new morning.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.628
An exciting new morning of changes

35:47.629 --> 35:51.899
and the introduction of
a new shared leadership.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.568
I'd like to announce, as of this morning,

35:53.569 --> 35:57.237
Divisional head Leslie Claret
will now be sharing leadership

35:57.238 --> 36:01.041
with me in every capacity,
across every department,

36:01.042 --> 36:02.677
side-by-side.

36:02.678 --> 36:06.313
Let's welcome Leslie
Claret on this new morning.

36:06.314 --> 36:07.983
Leslie.

36:13.088 --> 36:16.323
Thank you, Lawrence.

36:16.324 --> 36:21.128
Folks, what do we do,
essentially, here at McMillan?

36:21.129 --> 36:23.531
We design complex delivery systems for...

36:23.532 --> 36:26.433
Wrong. Sit down.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.835
No, seriously.

36:27.836 --> 36:29.937
We're sending mixed signals.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.106
Sit down.

36:35.243 --> 36:38.879
We make circles.

36:38.880 --> 36:42.917
Circles don't exist in nature, folks.

36:42.918 --> 36:45.252
The sun? No.

36:45.253 --> 36:48.255
Planets? Not quite.

36:48.256 --> 36:50.858
Circles are perfect.

36:50.859 --> 36:56.063
And nothing perfect exists in nature.

36:56.064 --> 36:58.265
Flaws in all.

36:58.266 --> 37:02.570
Slightly oblong,

37:02.571 --> 37:05.139
our planets, the sun.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.373
Like us.

37:08.076 --> 37:12.680
But here, at McMillan, we make them.

37:12.681 --> 37:16.584
And we place them in the world.

37:16.585 --> 37:22.356
The perfect form across the world.

37:22.357 --> 37:24.291
We make circles.

37:24.292 --> 37:27.628
And all you have to care about,

37:27.629 --> 37:30.598
the only thing that you have to care about,

37:30.599 --> 37:34.002
is this one little thing:

37:35.436 --> 37:37.538
Perfection.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.775
Aw, come on, now.

37:40.776 --> 37:42.810
It's just a goal. It's not a demand.

37:42.811 --> 37:44.945
No one is perfect.

37:44.946 --> 37:49.717
But what I need to know, what I need to see

37:49.718 --> 37:53.420
in you is capacity for perfection,

37:53.421 --> 37:57.992
the desire to be perfect.

37:57.993 --> 38:02.963
Stephen. John. Come up here.

38:02.964 --> 38:05.432
Show me how you can conjure perfection.

38:05.433 --> 38:09.870
Show me your attachment
to the form we place

38:09.871 --> 38:13.440
so lovingly, under our shared world.

38:13.441 --> 38:17.077
Stephen. Lakeman.

38:17.078 --> 38:18.646
How about it?

38:18.647 --> 38:20.881
Draw your most perfect circle.

38:20.882 --> 38:25.119
Draw it out of you, and then
draw it on the screen here.

38:25.120 --> 38:30.090
Show me your attachment
to the perfect form,

38:30.091 --> 38:31.525
to perfection.

39:29.918 --> 39:33.789
So how are we doing,
John, on this new morning?

39:35.623 --> 39:36.892
Pretty good.

39:38.426 --> 39:43.230
You know, John, I spent
some time last night just...

39:43.231 --> 39:48.769
Well, pondering how I was going
to respond to you this morning.

39:48.770 --> 39:52.072
On this new morning.

39:52.073 --> 39:54.274
Cool.

39:54.275 --> 39:57.577
Yeah, it was cool.

39:57.578 --> 39:58.946
I thought...

39:58.947 --> 40:03.317
Do I just fire him, first thing?

40:03.318 --> 40:06.320
Say, hey, not a good fit.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.588
Because I give two shits about this place

40:08.589 --> 40:11.258
and you don't, so not a good fit.

40:11.259 --> 40:12.827
So adios.

40:12.828 --> 40:15.595
And then I thought,

40:15.596 --> 40:20.735
hey, we all deserve a second chance.

40:20.736 --> 40:23.404
I know that. Hell.

40:25.306 --> 40:26.741
You know?

40:26.742 --> 40:28.809
Yeah.

40:28.810 --> 40:32.479
So I thought, I'll just give the kid

40:32.480 --> 40:35.315
something simple to do.

40:35.316 --> 40:36.951
We'll start with that.

40:36.952 --> 40:40.487
We'll... We'll build from there.

40:40.488 --> 40:43.190
I'll ask the kid

40:43.191 --> 40:47.527
to just draw a little circle.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.597
And maybe, in the simple
act of trying his best,

40:50.598 --> 40:53.533
maybe he'll win me over

40:53.534 --> 40:56.104
with a simple circle.

41:01.642 --> 41:07.514
Here's the impression your
little circle made on me, John.

41:07.515 --> 41:10.885
It lacked focus, ambition,

41:10.886 --> 41:13.888
clarity, precision,

41:13.889 --> 41:17.826
dedication, passion and honesty.

41:19.327 --> 41:22.798
And well,

41:24.365 --> 41:26.768
it reminded me of you.

41:27.803 --> 41:30.470
So...

41:30.471 --> 41:32.539
it seems you'll be staying on

41:32.540 --> 41:34.274
for this weekend's duck hunt.

41:34.275 --> 41:40.447
And then it seems you'll
have a new morning of your own

41:40.448 --> 41:43.317
at some new endeavor.

41:48.289 --> 41:50.425
I wish you well.

43:00.261 --> 43:01.661
An accounting discrepancy

43:01.662 --> 43:03.530
concerning a file under your office.

43:03.531 --> 43:05.099
I'd like to arrange a
visit at your convenience

43:05.100 --> 43:06.666
to help me make some sense of it.

43:06.667 --> 43:08.302
Again, Brent Paddocks.

43:08.303 --> 43:12.107
General Accounting Office. Extension 775.

43:25.887 --> 43:27.821
Hey.

43:27.822 --> 43:29.823
How's it going?

43:29.824 --> 43:31.625
Pretty good.

43:31.626 --> 43:33.627
John, I just learned of a complication.

43:33.628 --> 43:35.229
This interview, this policewoman?

43:35.230 --> 43:36.330
Yeah?

43:36.331 --> 43:39.134
Ace that. We can't get derailed.

43:51.679 --> 43:53.247
Tom, hey, you asked us

43:53.248 --> 43:55.349
to pay some attention to an Alice Taylor.

43:55.350 --> 43:57.117
She didn't show up for work today.

43:57.118 --> 44:01.455
She didn't call in sick. Just a no show.

44:01.456 --> 44:04.791
Okay, so you remember being in
the company of your colleague

44:04.792 --> 44:06.726
moments before your accident.

44:06.727 --> 44:09.529
Let's orient there.

44:09.530 --> 44:12.199
What were you doing in those moments?

44:12.200 --> 44:15.002
He told me that his interview went poorly.

44:15.003 --> 44:16.937
John.

44:16.938 --> 44:19.039
And I told him that I crushed mine.

44:19.040 --> 44:22.042
Then I tried to fucking cheer him up.

44:22.043 --> 44:23.743
Locker room talk.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.012
Got it.

44:25.013 --> 44:26.013
Pull it back.

44:26.014 --> 44:27.347
Yeah.

44:27.348 --> 44:32.586
Okay. So then? What
happened next on that day?

44:32.587 --> 44:34.922
Then we just stood here.

44:36.257 --> 44:40.161
Then I felt a feeling...

44:57.945 --> 45:00.114
John.

45:00.115 --> 45:02.149
John, you're wife's here.

45:02.150 --> 45:03.650
Hey, Dennis.

45:03.651 --> 45:05.652
Hey, John.

45:05.653 --> 45:07.322
John, come here.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.160
Are you okay?

45:15.030 --> 45:18.632
I'm sorry, man.

45:18.633 --> 45:20.367
I made things hard for you.

45:20.368 --> 45:23.037
I shouldn't have even
ever tried to help, man.

45:23.038 --> 45:25.005
Help me, Dennis. Right now.

45:25.006 --> 45:26.473
Fuck yeah.

45:26.474 --> 45:27.541
Take this baton.

45:27.542 --> 45:28.542
What?

45:28.543 --> 45:30.077
I'm holding a baton. Take the baton.

45:30.078 --> 45:31.278
Why are you holding a baton?

45:31.279 --> 45:32.412
Just take the baton.

45:32.413 --> 45:34.814
Keep hugging me and take the baton.

45:34.815 --> 45:39.553
Okay, I have the baton.

45:39.554 --> 45:41.088
Conceal the baton.

45:41.089 --> 45:43.590
Okay, I concealed the baton.

45:43.591 --> 45:46.393
Walk away with it. The detective's coming.

45:46.394 --> 45:48.496
I'm walking away with the baton.

45:52.467 --> 45:53.633
John Lakeman?

45:53.634 --> 45:54.801
Yeah.

45:54.802 --> 45:57.037
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

45:57.038 --> 45:58.872
Detective Agathe Albans.

45:58.873 --> 46:00.674
I'm in the Office of Homicide,

46:00.675 --> 46:03.377
in the police department of
Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.

46:03.378 --> 46:06.580
I have formal authority to
ask you a series of questions

46:06.581 --> 46:08.715
concerning a homicide that took place

46:08.716 --> 46:10.284
on the evening of May 11th.

46:10.285 --> 46:12.652
The murder of Hector Barros.

46:12.653 --> 46:13.687
Can we do this today?

46:13.688 --> 46:18.858
I've got a lot going on today.

46:18.859 --> 46:21.161
My expectation is this will
take an hour of your time.

46:21.162 --> 46:23.763
You caught us in a transition today

46:23.764 --> 46:27.067
I'm trying to make up some ground today.

46:27.068 --> 46:30.104
Today would be best. For me.

46:30.105 --> 46:32.072
Today would be bad. For me.

46:32.073 --> 46:35.375
Tomorrow would be good. For me.

46:35.376 --> 46:38.113
Tomorrow would be bad. For me.

46:40.848 --> 46:42.783
Rochambeau?

48:09.337 --> 48:11.605
What's the nature of your work?

48:11.606 --> 48:13.640
Circles.

48:13.641 --> 48:15.209
In what sense?

48:15.210 --> 48:16.943
In the sense that pipes are circles.

48:16.944 --> 48:19.946
And I just deal with pipes.

48:19.947 --> 48:22.216
You're very good at this.

48:22.217 --> 48:26.920
Thanks.

48:26.921 --> 48:28.389
You, too.

48:44.071 --> 48:46.241
You're remarkably good at this.

48:49.210 --> 48:50.977
Thanks.

48:50.978 --> 48:52.847
You, too.

49:00.755 --> 49:02.922
Darn.

49:02.923 --> 49:05.459
Yeah.

49:05.460 --> 49:07.994
So you'll field my questions today, Sir?

49:07.995 --> 49:09.296
Well, we had a deal, so...

49:09.297 --> 49:12.666
Yes, we had a deal, sir.

49:12.667 --> 49:17.637
Probably going to be on the
later side, is that okay?

49:17.638 --> 49:20.006
Please find time at your
earliest convenience.

49:20.007 --> 49:23.210
Yeah, of course.

53:08.335 --> 53:10.470
It's become late.

53:10.471 --> 53:12.305
Now is the last possible
minute we can begin

53:12.306 --> 53:15.742
my series of questions and
have you fulfill your agreement

53:15.743 --> 53:17.545
to interview today.

53:20.681 --> 53:22.883
Be right in.

53:37.965 --> 53:40.200
Is there anything you would
like to say as we begin?

53:43.871 --> 53:46.205
Yes.

53:46.206 --> 53:47.708
Proceed.

53:52.513 --> 53:55.182
I'm not really an industrial engineer.
