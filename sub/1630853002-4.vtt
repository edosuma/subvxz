WEBVTT

00:27.600 --> 00:28.440
Shh. Shh!

00:32.960 --> 00:34.040
Wait, it's me!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.240
Alfie?

00:36.320 --> 00:37.520
Oh!

00:37.600 --> 00:40.120
Are you alright,
Sister Reg, I heard...

00:40.200 --> 00:41.200
Oh.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.720
Sister Boniface.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.000
Meet my little brother.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.000
Maggie said I
weren't welcome back.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.360
But I'm going straight
this time, I mean it.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.400
The prodigal son,
returning to the fold.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.960
She got a screw loose or what?

01:27.240 --> 01:28.440
So.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.000
You get released from jail

01:30.080 --> 01:32.080
and you decide to
start your new life

01:32.160 --> 01:34.000
as a law abiding citizen

01:34.080 --> 01:35.680
by breaking into a convent!

01:35.760 --> 01:37.680
Can't a man visit his sister?

01:37.760 --> 01:40.000
I thought I might
stay for a bit.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.400
Oh, no. No.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.640
The Reverend Mother
wouldn't allow it.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.400
Why not?

01:44.480 --> 01:45.920
It's not my fault
I got banged up.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.480
When I was a nipper,
our Dad asked me

01:47.560 --> 01:49.760
to join the family business.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.160
How was I to know it mostly
involved nicking stuff?

01:52.240 --> 01:53.440
This is a convent, Alfie.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.640
Not a halfway house.

01:55.720 --> 01:56.480
Fair enough.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.400
I'll have to take my chance

01:58.480 --> 01:59.200
with the old gang, then.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.680
It won't be long before
I succumb to temptation,

02:02.760 --> 02:06.400
but perhaps prison
is where I belong.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.000
There must be
something we can do.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.240
We got some wine.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.520
Needs shifting to the museum

02:17.600 --> 02:19.440
for a shindig they're having.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.040
Lend a hand,

02:21.120 --> 02:23.160
keep your grubby fingers
off the merchandise,

02:24.560 --> 02:26.760
and I'll find you
somewhere to stay.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.320
I'm not sure the Lord
created this humble body

02:29.400 --> 02:30.640
for physical labour.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.720
Well, He didn't create it

02:31.800 --> 02:33.560
for doing over post offices!

02:34.720 --> 02:35.840
Prefer I tell the police

02:35.920 --> 02:37.960
an ex-convict attacked
me last night?

02:39.120 --> 02:41.320
When you put it like that, sis,

02:41.400 --> 02:43.120
where do I start?

02:46.840 --> 02:48.240
Plenty of light.

02:51.920 --> 02:52.680
It's perfect.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.600
Just as perfect as that
gallery in Kensington.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.960
A London happening
is too predictable.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.080
I wanna bring my
work to the masses!

03:01.160 --> 03:04.200
Why aren't we in
Liverpool or Manchester?

03:04.280 --> 03:06.320
Heaven forbid, Birmingham.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.480
The only masses here are sheep.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.680
Where do you want
this, Mr. Ardwell?

03:09.760 --> 03:12.120
Need anything else?

03:12.200 --> 03:14.120
To wake up and realise
it's a bad dream.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.040
What's the matter with
you, Francis, huh?

03:19.120 --> 03:20.440
What's the matter
with you, man?!

03:20.520 --> 03:22.560
You're here with
the wine, Sister...?

03:22.640 --> 03:24.520
Reginald, Reg is fine.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.320
Right, rest is in the van,

03:25.400 --> 03:27.360
just need to settle up.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.000
This is more than you
quoted last month.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.800
Thing about wine is
the older it gets,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.200
the more valuable it becomes.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.640
Since the refurbishment,
the museum's finances

03:37.720 --> 03:39.120
have been hanging by a thread.

03:39.200 --> 03:39.960
Couldn't we-

03:40.040 --> 03:41.400
Is that Gerry Ardwell?

03:41.480 --> 03:42.760
Yes.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.600
Tonight's party is to
celebrate the launch

03:44.680 --> 03:48.520
of his new exhibition,
sorry, happening.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.680
How about a 10% discount
for two free tickets?

03:51.760 --> 03:52.800
Deal.

03:52.880 --> 03:53.640
Massive fan.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.560
Don't worry, you can come too.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.840
She's a bit of a
looker, in't she?

04:01.920 --> 04:03.280
That's the Virgin Mary.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.720
It's not very big, is it?

04:06.800 --> 04:09.120
Couldn't you afford
the full sized version?

04:09.200 --> 04:10.880
It's the Immaculate Conception

04:10.960 --> 04:12.160
by Sebastian Glendinning,

04:12.240 --> 04:14.480
it's worth over 50,000 pounds.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.280
And I thought I knew how
to get money for nothing.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.200
I should be shaking Mr.
Glendinning by the hand.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.920
He's been dead for two centuries

04:22.000 --> 04:23.960
but if you light that
cigarette in my gallery,

04:24.040 --> 04:25.880
you might just get a
chance to meet him.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.680
I'll just fetch the rest
of the plonk, shall I?

04:33.160 --> 04:34.680
Get off me! Bridy!

04:34.760 --> 04:36.680
Stop it. Keep it down.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.080
Sister Reginald.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.680
I telephoned about the room.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.600
No alcohol, no radios,

04:47.680 --> 04:51.880
no guests, especially
women, including nuns.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.920
The front door is locked
at nine every night.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.360
Nine o'clock?

04:55.440 --> 04:56.640
But what if I'm out?

04:56.720 --> 04:59.440
Then you will remain
out, Mr. Lynch.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.760
I only make an exception
for two of my guests

05:01.840 --> 05:03.720
because they are
officers of the law.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.840
You've got coppers staying?

05:05.920 --> 05:08.160
I love coppers.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.400
He'll give you no
trouble, Mrs. Clam.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.360
If he does, he'll
be swiftly ejected.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.960
Payment is in advance.

05:15.040 --> 05:15.800
Come along, then.

05:17.000 --> 05:17.760
I might as well be back in jail.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.440
It can be arranged.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.120
Help yourself to a drink.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.520
We make the wine at the convent.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.400
Oh, do you?

05:33.480 --> 05:34.280
So.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.160
That's the aftertaste,
is it? Guilt?

05:39.560 --> 05:40.600
Ardwell.

05:40.680 --> 05:41.480
Ardwell?

05:43.200 --> 05:44.440
Thought you could
hide yourself from me

05:44.520 --> 05:45.760
in the sticks, eh?

05:45.840 --> 05:47.520
Far from it, Dickie.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.960
I know how far you
travel for a free bar.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.640
Come on,
tell. Tell my readers.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.000
Which artist will
you be plagiarising

05:54.080 --> 05:55.960
for this latest exhibition?

05:56.040 --> 05:56.880
Readers?

05:58.480 --> 06:01.080
Dear chap, I didn't
realise you had any left.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.880
Well done you.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.600
I don't see what all
the fuss is about.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.680
Oh, you are a Philistine!

06:13.760 --> 06:15.720
Where's your
appreciation of beauty?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.120
Oh! Mr. Ardwell?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.640
Excuse me, sorry.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.880
Mr. Ardwell. Ruth
Penny, Albion Bugle.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.000
I love your work.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.280
Feeling's mutual.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.360
May I have a quote about why
you chose Great Slaughter

06:34.440 --> 06:35.360
for your exhibition?

06:36.760 --> 06:40.680
How about I give you my
telephone number first?

06:40.760 --> 06:45.520
Well, let's start
with the quote.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.680
Having fun?

07:43.040 --> 07:44.600
What do you know about
this Gerry Ardwell?

07:47.080 --> 07:49.480
Bad boy of the British art
scene, very experimental.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.840
Yes.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.960
Once spent 24 hours
staring into a bucket.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.800
What was in the bucket?

07:55.880 --> 07:59.800
Oh, this is Francis Scritton,
my studio assistant.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.160
When I found him, he was
a grubby little orphan

08:02.240 --> 08:03.840
who could barely
hold a paintbrush.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.560
Not technically true.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.480
Soon, thanks to my tutelage,

08:07.560 --> 08:10.880
he'll be the toast
of the Royal Academy.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.520
Sorry to interrupt.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.320
It's time.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.480
Duty calls.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.400
Well, good luck.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.920
So. What are you working on?

08:22.000 --> 08:22.920
Not much.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.760
Mr. Ardwell keeps me very busy.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.600
Well, surely you need to
have your own projects.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.480
Oh, there is one project.

08:29.560 --> 08:32.040
I've been planning it
for years, but I just-

08:32.120 --> 08:33.400
Lilly Ardwell.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.240
Gerry's wife.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.080
Oh, he...?

08:37.800 --> 08:39.720
How do you do?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
as museum director

08:44.760 --> 08:46.320
it is my enormous pleasure

08:46.400 --> 08:51.080
to introduce the
world-renowned Gerry Ardwell.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.280
Thank you, Madeleine.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.080
Throughout my career,

08:58.160 --> 09:02.320
I have sought to deconstruct

09:02.400 --> 09:05.280
the walls of elitism
separating traditional art

09:05.360 --> 09:08.160
from the common man.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.640
With my latest
work, I go further.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.880
Bridging the gap between
artist and audience.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.160
For the next month,

09:21.720 --> 09:22.520
this is my home.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.840
I'll not leave this stage

09:25.920 --> 09:29.040
even for the most private
of bodily functions.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.160
When the museum's open,
you may observe me

09:32.240 --> 09:33.760
however you see fit.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.360
At night, the gallery
is locked and alarmed

09:40.040 --> 09:44.400
and I'll be incarcerated
with these other exhibits.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.320
The artist as living art.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.320
Yes, if you wish to
glimpse the true nature

09:57.400 --> 10:00.080
of the art of Gerry Ardwell,

10:00.160 --> 10:04.400
examine the contents of
his bucket.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.240
I'll take that. Just in case.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.600
It's exactly as
Mr. Ardwell asked.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.560
Know what he's like first
thing in the morning,

10:30.640 --> 10:34.880
don't want to get your
head bitten off, do you?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.560
Gerry?

10:50.320 --> 10:51.760
Gerry...

10:53.760 --> 10:55.120
-Gerry?
-Gerry...

11:02.680 --> 11:04.320
Inspector.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.120
Please tell me you'll find
the Immaculate Conception.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.040
We'll do our best, but for now

11:09.120 --> 11:10.840
our priority is Mr.
Ardwell's death.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.600
Sorry for your
loss, Mrs. Ardwell.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.520
Doesn't make sense.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.240
We locked him in.
He was all alone.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.080
Rest assured, we will bring
the culprit to justice.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.200
Let us know if there's
anything we can do.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.200
What happened?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.680
Oh.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.840
A window was forced
from the outside.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.960
The victim suffered blunt
trauma to the cranium,

11:44.040 --> 11:47.720
no other wounds, and,
oh, and I found this.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.240
What am I looking at?

11:53.320 --> 11:54.720
Discoloration on the plinth.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.440
This figurine has been moved
from its usual position, see?

11:59.520 --> 12:02.720
Oh, and there are blood
traces on the base.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.480
That's our murder weapon.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.280
I'll check with the
victim's blood type.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.200
So far, no fingerprints.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.120
So someone breaks
in via the window,

12:10.200 --> 12:11.480
they go to steal a painting,

12:11.560 --> 12:13.080
not realising that
Mr. Ardwell's here

12:13.160 --> 12:14.440
and then he tries to stop them

12:14.520 --> 12:16.680
and gets bludgeoned
with a bronze figurine.

12:16.760 --> 12:17.800
What about the alarm?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.200
Mrs. Rigley?

12:24.080 --> 12:25.720
Is the gallery alarmed at night?

12:25.800 --> 12:27.080
Always.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.680
I tested the alarm
before the party

12:28.760 --> 12:31.040
and turned it on before I left.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.280
If the thief entered
through a window,

12:32.360 --> 12:33.760
it should've gone off.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.040
And where's the control box?

12:35.120 --> 12:36.200
My office.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.240
Who else has access?

12:38.320 --> 12:41.200
Usually, only me,
I keep it locked.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.320
But yesterday I gave my
spare key to Mrs. Ardwell

12:44.400 --> 12:46.640
and Mr. Scritton so that
they could store things

12:46.720 --> 12:48.200
for the party.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.320
Oh, and Dickie Whitfield,
the art critic.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.560
He'd driven straight from London

12:53.640 --> 12:55.560
so I let him use the
office to freshen up.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.280
Thank you.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.840
Smells like Old Nun's.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.560
I beg your pardon?

13:13.640 --> 13:14.880
Old Nun tobacco,

13:14.960 --> 13:16.280
my father used to smoke it.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.600
Mrs. Clam's neighbour saw a man

13:20.680 --> 13:21.760
climbing out of her
guest house window

13:21.840 --> 13:22.600
late last night.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.160
It wasn't me.

13:28.840 --> 13:29.800
I know who it was.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.360
Mr. Lynch?

13:38.280 --> 13:39.080
Let me.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.680
Alfie.

13:42.760 --> 13:43.880
Open up, it's the police.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.040
He appears to have checked out.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.480
Perhaps he went for a walk.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.320
Not out
of the front door,

13:54.400 --> 13:55.480
I'd have seen him, oh.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.640
For once, Sister, your services

13:58.720 --> 14:00.560
may be surplus to requirements.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.440
Is Alfie stupid? Yes.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.920
Is he a lazy, selfish,
greedy little toe rag? Yes.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.560
-Sisters.
-Morning.

14:12.640 --> 14:15.080
Sisters.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.880
What was I saying?

14:16.960 --> 14:18.320
Did Alfie kill Mr. Ardwell?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.440
Oh! Not a chance.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.200
To break in, disable the alarm

14:22.280 --> 14:23.560
and leave no fingerprints?

14:23.640 --> 14:25.280
It looks professional.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.320
Perhaps your brother
was caught off guard.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.960
Alfie wouldn't hurt a fly.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.560
What about the Snosebridge job?

14:31.640 --> 14:33.200
He was there, but-

14:33.280 --> 14:34.280
Snosebridge?

14:34.360 --> 14:35.800
Payroll robbery.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.520
Local bobby tried to intervene.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.640
So Alfie's gang beat him up.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.240
He was lucky to survive.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.040
It was Alfie who
told them to stop.

14:43.120 --> 14:43.960
According to him.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.320
He did his time.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.200
Where is he?

14:50.680 --> 14:52.840
If you see him, tell
him to hand himself in.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.480
Let's go.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.320
You gotta do something.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.400
Like what?

15:02.480 --> 15:04.080
Prove Alfie's innocent.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.160
Thank you.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.400
The alert has gone out.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.000
Are you sure Alfie
Lynch is our man?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.280
It was him.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.680
I just, I can't work out

15:16.760 --> 15:17.800
how he forced the window

15:17.880 --> 15:19.840
without triggering the alarm.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.680
Madeleine Rigley said
that she tested the alarm

15:21.760 --> 15:22.640
before the party.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.320
What if Lynch had an accomplice?

15:24.400 --> 15:26.000
Someone who sabotaged the
alarm during the evening.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.360
Yes.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.480
Who had access to the
controls in the office?

15:29.560 --> 15:30.720
-Lilly Ardwell.
-Mhmm.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.200
Francis Scritton, and Dickie,

15:32.280 --> 15:33.680
-Dickie...
-Whitfield.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.200
Dickie Whitfield, yes.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.400
Unless Mrs. Rigley was lying.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.720
She's looking at a
sizable insurance payout.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.040
Start there.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.520
I'll brief Lowesley,
and then meet me

15:42.600 --> 15:43.880
at the Tudor Hall Hotel.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.120
I wanna see what
the victim's wife

15:45.200 --> 15:46.560
and little helper have to say.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.880
Any updates on the Ardwell case?

15:51.960 --> 15:52.720
Nice hat.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.280
What do you know about
Dickie Whitfield,

15:55.360 --> 15:56.960
the art critic?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.440
Or Drinky Whitfield as he's
affectionately known, why?

15:58.520 --> 15:59.720
Quid pro quo.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.040
See what you can dig up on him,

16:01.120 --> 16:03.240
anything to do with
him and Gerry Ardwell.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.400
And if I dish the dirt?

16:05.480 --> 16:07.560
Regular updates and
an exclusive interview

16:07.640 --> 16:09.200
with the officer in charge.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.360
Well, how could a girl refuse?

16:11.440 --> 16:13.040
Alright, swing by
this afternoon.

16:13.120 --> 16:13.920
Toodle pip!

16:46.560 --> 16:48.920
What happens if
the press discovers

16:49.000 --> 16:52.160
that one of our sisters is
related to the murderer?

16:52.240 --> 16:54.200
I told you, Reverend
Mulberry, it weren't him.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.920
How can you be certain?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.680
Because we have an arrangement.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.120
Your brother is
clearly a lost soul.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.080
Oh no, not with Alfie, with God.

17:06.600 --> 17:10.320
My family always has a relaxed
interpretation of the law.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.160
I am aware of that
among your relatives

17:12.240 --> 17:15.440
there's a certain
criminal element.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.760
Element?

17:16.840 --> 17:18.480
The whole blooming
periodic table.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.760
So, I made God a deal.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.200
A life of service in
return for keeping

17:25.280 --> 17:27.480
my nearest out of the
clutches of the Devil.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.280
You should pray
for your brother.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.800
And I shall pray for you.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.240
Oh, look.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.840
I know Alfie ain't
Your finest work.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.000
But help me find him.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.080
I just wanna know he's alright.

17:46.160 --> 17:46.960
Psst!

17:48.560 --> 17:49.880
Fair play, quick work.

17:49.960 --> 17:50.840
I know what they think

17:50.920 --> 17:52.160
but it weren't me, I swear.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.680
Shh!

17:55.760 --> 17:57.200
I need to hide.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.800
Well you can't stay here!

17:58.880 --> 18:00.360
You stick out like a sore thumb.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.560
Unless...

18:04.800 --> 18:06.160
I went straight home.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.240
I was there until I
opened up this morning.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.720
And how well did you
know Mr. Ardwell?

18:12.800 --> 18:15.840
We were at art school together.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.760
Even courted for a little while.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.600
But, just a silly fling.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.960
Gerry was never the type
to settle for one woman.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.320
Before yesterday, I
hadn't seen him in years.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.680
Will that be all?

18:28.760 --> 18:30.800
I promised to
update the trustees.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.800
We'll be in contact if
there's anything else.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.600
Where's Sam?

18:35.680 --> 18:38.200
I said I'd meet him at
the hotel, I should go.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.040
No, no, no, no, no.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.680
I was looking at the
scene of crime photographs

18:41.760 --> 18:43.280
and there's something funny
about the blood spatters.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.160
For a nun, you have a
disturbing interpretation

18:45.240 --> 18:46.840
for the word funny.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.840
It'll have to wait, sorry.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.040
Our top priority is
catching Alfie Lynch.

19:20.160 --> 19:20.880
I think you're right, Sister,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.000
it wasn't Alfie.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.800
I'm glad to hear you're
on my side, sweetheart.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.040
Alfie Lynch?

19:33.120 --> 19:34.000
No. Sorry.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.800
Well, he's a known criminal,

19:35.880 --> 19:37.240
staying at a guest
house in town.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.720
We believe he broke in
assisted by a person

19:39.800 --> 19:41.520
or persons unknown.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.920
How long have you
worked for Mr. Ardwell?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.600
About a year.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.680
Were you close?

19:48.360 --> 19:50.040
I never knew my real father.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.080
Without Gerry I wouldn't
be the man I am today.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.200
What exactly did you do for him?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.160
Everything.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.600
Gerry generated a lot of ideas.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.680
He needed someone to
create the actual pieces.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.280
Must have been galling,

20:04.360 --> 20:06.680
you doing all the work
and him taking the credit.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.400
All great masters
had apprentices.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.360
Message from Sister Boniface.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.280
She needs you at the
lab as soon as possible.

20:14.360 --> 20:15.720
Right.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.480
Hope you catch this Lynch fella.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.400
We will. And whoever
he's working with.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.600
I know it was daft, but I
was getting the jitters,

20:31.680 --> 20:33.920
stuck in that room, so
I hopped out the window

20:34.000 --> 20:35.520
and went to the pub.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.240
Then this morning,
I heard them coppers

20:37.320 --> 20:39.200
talking about a murder.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.240
I knew I'd get stitched
up, so I legged it.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.040
Maybe if I explain to Sam that-

20:43.120 --> 20:44.040
No.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.600
He'll have Alfie banged up.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.440
Yes, but...

20:48.200 --> 20:49.120
Yeah.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.400
They're good, in't they?

20:50.480 --> 20:51.760
One of Bridy's old brassieres

20:51.840 --> 20:54.280
and a couple of spuds
I got out the kitchen.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.520
Yes, very...

20:56.680 --> 20:57.880
Creative.

20:57.960 --> 20:58.720
The thing is-

21:01.720 --> 21:03.640
Do you mind stepping outside?

21:03.720 --> 21:05.280
Important police work, sisters,

21:05.360 --> 21:06.640
sorry for the inconvenience.

21:11.840 --> 21:12.680
What's so urgent?

21:15.120 --> 21:16.480
Fact.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.560
If someone's hit on the
head while standing up,

21:18.640 --> 21:20.920
you expect a wide
blood spray pattern.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.560
Mr. Ardwell was
already lying down.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.160
See the two lines
in the floor wax,

21:25.240 --> 21:27.280
running from the
stage to the body?

21:27.360 --> 21:28.600
So Mr. Ardwell
was hit on the head

21:28.680 --> 21:29.640
while he was still sleeping

21:29.720 --> 21:31.360
and then dragged
to the painting?

21:31.440 --> 21:33.200
There'd be a trail of blood, no.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.720
Judging by the dilated pupils,

21:34.800 --> 21:36.680
I think Gerry was drugged.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.320
Dragged to the painting.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.200
And then hit with
the bronze figurine

21:49.280 --> 21:51.760
to look like he'd
disturbed a thief.

22:06.080 --> 22:06.840
Sorry.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.960
These four had
access to the alarms.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.120
Any of them could have
also drugged Mr. Ardwell.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.560
So which one of them's
working with Alfie Lynch?

22:14.640 --> 22:15.800
Oh, we can't be
certain Alfie was-

22:15.880 --> 22:17.640
The bobby from Snosebridge,

22:17.720 --> 22:20.320
got beaten up by Alfie's
gang, he's a mate.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.040
And he's never been the same.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.560
So I'm gonna find Alfie

22:23.640 --> 22:25.800
and I'm gonna put him in
jail where he belongs.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.440
With the police about,

22:36.520 --> 22:37.240
you're gonna have
to stay in here.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.240
But what about lunch?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.320
Try feeding your soul

22:41.400 --> 22:43.640
instead of your belly for once.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.480
Wait, Bridy.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.360
I really am trying to change.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.840
I'm unlucky, that's all.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.840
You choose good or
you choose evil.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.560
Luck has got nothing
to do with it.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.680
That's easy for
you to say in here.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.920
Not surrounded by
temptation like I am.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.800
Oh, you think I've
never been tempted?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.800
I could've taken the
easy route like mum.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.040
Strutting down the high street

23:04.120 --> 23:05.520
in her knocked off fur coat.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.160
Half cut on gin.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.080
Turning a blind eye
while you lot divvy up

23:09.160 --> 23:10.960
the spoils on the kitchen table.

23:11.040 --> 23:11.840
No.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.120
I wanted a decent life.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.680
And an honest life.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.080
It takes hard work.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.560
Read it. You might
learn something.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.160
What's all this?

23:37.240 --> 23:39.920
Articles where you
criticise Gerry Ardwell.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.280
I'm a critic.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.960
The clue is in the name.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.800
"Gerry Ardwell epitomises

23:44.880 --> 23:47.120
everything that's wrong
with his generation.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.200
Superficiality, egotism,

23:49.280 --> 23:51.360
obsession with celebrity."

23:51.440 --> 23:53.480
Why do you
hate him so much?

23:53.560 --> 23:54.560
After his first exhibition

23:54.640 --> 23:56.680
Ardwell wrote a manifesto,

23:56.760 --> 24:00.160
declaring that
traditional art is dead.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.360
He singled out one
artist in particular,

24:02.440 --> 24:03.880
Robert Eddington.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.080
Dismissing his life's work

24:06.160 --> 24:10.120
as outdated and irrelevant.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.240
So?

24:11.320 --> 24:12.360
Robert was my friend.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.680
He killed himself a week later,

24:17.880 --> 24:19.920
left behind a wife and a child,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.640
so I hated Ardwell, yes,

24:22.720 --> 24:25.160
but this was 20 years ago.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.520
If I wanted him dead, why
would I wait until now?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.080
You tell me.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.400
Someone at that party
disabled the alarm

24:31.480 --> 24:32.960
to allow the murderer inside

24:33.040 --> 24:35.120
and you had access
to those controls.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.680
Well, this is
hardly in my skillset.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.440
But if you are looking
for an accomplice,

24:42.520 --> 24:43.440
what about the widow?

24:44.680 --> 24:45.960
Huh?

24:46.040 --> 24:50.600
Ardwell was a known womaniser.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.160
Hey.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.640
Look at this.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.960
Gerry Ardwell with
fiance, Maddy Rigley.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.520
What if Dickie's right?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.720
What if Lilly knew that Ardwell

25:02.800 --> 25:04.240
was here visiting an old flame?

25:08.600 --> 25:09.400
May we come in?

25:11.920 --> 25:12.880
Is there a problem?

25:14.160 --> 25:14.960
No.

25:16.280 --> 25:19.360
Have you found the murderer yet?

25:19.440 --> 25:20.720
Not yet.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.480
We'd like a better idea
of people's movements

25:22.560 --> 25:24.120
after the party.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.480
Well, I walked straight
back here with Francis,

25:27.560 --> 25:29.160
said goodnight to
him downstairs,

25:29.240 --> 25:30.880
and came to bed.

25:30.960 --> 25:31.680
-Hmm.
-Why?

25:33.160 --> 25:34.280
We're exploring the possibility

25:34.360 --> 25:36.000
someone else was involved.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.320
Did you know that your husband

25:37.400 --> 25:39.440
and Madeleine Rigley
were once engaged?

25:39.520 --> 25:41.120
Of course.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.360
Gerry told me everything.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.360
Ancient history.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.080
Oh, that's Gerry's.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.120
He could be quite a slob.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.400
Is there anything else?

25:56.560 --> 25:58.880
That lock is broken, I think.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.360
I called down to reception, but-

26:01.240 --> 26:02.680
Open up.

26:02.760 --> 26:03.840
I won't ask again.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.080
Sister Reginald?

26:31.160 --> 26:32.480
Hmm?

26:32.560 --> 26:34.320
Didn't you hear the bell?

26:34.400 --> 26:35.680
Hmm.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.640
You don't want to
be late for chapel.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.600
Sister Reginald.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.200
It's just a bit of fun.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.120
Gerry was always going
off with other women.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.960
It must've made you very angry.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.480
No.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.520
Well, yes, but I
didn't kill him.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.440
Lilly and I were
together all night.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.240
So it couldn't have
been either of us.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.040
Forgive us if we're
sceptical of the widow

27:01.120 --> 27:03.120
and her new lover
exchanging alibis.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.080
The night porter can confirm

27:05.160 --> 27:06.600
that we arrived back together

27:06.680 --> 27:08.800
and didn't leave
until after breakfast.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.760
Nonetheless, either of you

27:09.840 --> 27:11.080
could've drugged Mr. Ardwell

27:11.160 --> 27:12.480
and cut the alarm
ready for Mr. Lynch

27:12.560 --> 27:14.520
to come and do the rest.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
Never even heard of
the man until today.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.320
We've only got
your word for that.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.160
As I've already mentioned,

28:00.240 --> 28:03.680
we have an interesting
visitor here today.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.120
Someone who will be familiar
to many of you, I'm sure.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.160
Father Brown.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.560
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.480
Sister Boniface.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.120
It is reassuring to see

28:28.120 --> 28:32.400
that your community is not
only surviving, but thriving.

28:34.120 --> 28:37.200
I even see some fresh
faces sat here today.

28:40.760 --> 28:45.560
-He knows. He knows.

28:50.200 --> 28:54.800
Sister Reginald. Sister
Boniface and guest.

28:54.880 --> 28:57.760
Please remain
behind after chapel.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.640
I really don't mind staying.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.400
It's convent business, Father.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.320
What were you thinking?

29:21.400 --> 29:24.560
Bringing a known criminal
into our holy refuge

29:24.640 --> 29:27.600
and then allowing him
to desecrate your habit!

29:27.680 --> 29:28.880
I never did.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.760
I wouldn't, not in a convent!

29:30.840 --> 29:33.560
-I-

29:33.640 --> 29:34.960
Sorry about that.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.680
He's mocking our
very way of life.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.600
If I may-

29:39.680 --> 29:41.240
No you may not!

29:41.320 --> 29:43.160
I shall inform the police
that we've discovered

29:43.240 --> 29:44.880
the whereabouts of the fugitive.

29:46.280 --> 29:48.320
Aren't criminals meant
to be given sanctuary

29:48.400 --> 29:49.640
by the church?

29:49.720 --> 29:51.280
Oh, so you're admitting
he's a criminal now?

29:51.360 --> 29:52.240
Well...

29:54.280 --> 29:55.880
He has sinned. Yes.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.480
But he was raised in
a family of sinners

29:57.560 --> 30:00.120
and now he wishes to
turn towards the light

30:00.200 --> 30:01.640
and shouldn't we help him?

30:01.720 --> 30:03.400
Sanctuary is an
archaic tradition,

30:03.480 --> 30:05.800
holding no basis in modern law.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.840
I will not put the
sisters in danger.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.680
He's not dangerous,
he's my brother.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.200
And if you throw him out,

30:14.280 --> 30:15.440
I'm going too.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.920
I beg your pardon?

30:17.000 --> 30:17.920
There's nothing else I can do

30:18.000 --> 30:19.520
but leave St. Vincent's.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.400
And may I say,
you might struggle

30:21.480 --> 30:23.080
to balance the books without me.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.080
Sister Reginald, you are
a highly valued member

30:26.160 --> 30:29.360
of this convent, but I
will not allow St Vincent's

30:29.440 --> 30:30.640
to be blackmailed.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.880
-Very well-
-No, wait.

30:34.440 --> 30:37.120
You can't do this,
right? This is your life.

30:38.680 --> 30:39.920
Gonna turn myself in.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.400
They'll throw you in jail.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.560
Not if Sister Boniface
catches who done it.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.880
-But-
-But Bridy!

30:47.440 --> 30:50.240
I never done nothing
good in my whole life.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.120
Let me do this.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.280
Well, that's settled then.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.720
You'll clear my name, right?

30:58.800 --> 31:00.360
Oh, absolutely, yes.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.680
100%.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.320
Or 90 at the very least.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.480
Actually, let's say 85.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.920
It's good enough for me.

31:09.160 --> 31:09.920
I should go.

31:15.160 --> 31:15.960
Alfie.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.920
You might want to get changed.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.640
Yeah.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.320
It's a pity.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.080
I mean, these things are
surprisingly comfortable.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.920
Now, according to the
post-mortem I was right.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.760
Enough barbiturates
in Gerry's bloodstream

31:43.840 --> 31:45.640
to send him to join
the choir invisible.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.320
Right, let's talk motive.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.720
Madeleine Rigley.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.080
She's a jilted ex-fiance,

31:52.160 --> 31:54.600
needed the insurance
money to save the gallery.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.280
Lilly Ardwell, was sick
of her husband's adultery

31:57.360 --> 31:58.960
and stands to
inherit his wealth.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.760
Francis Scritton, he
was his love rival

32:00.840 --> 32:03.600
and presumably envied
his success as an artist.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.000
And then there's
Dickie Whitfield.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.880
Whose friend, Robert Eddington,

32:06.960 --> 32:10.040
was driven to suicide by Gerry.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.480
And Dickie has the contacts

32:11.560 --> 32:13.480
to shift the painting
on the black market.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.160
Now, Lilly,
Francis and Dickie

32:16.240 --> 32:17.000
were all staying
at the same hotel,

32:17.080 --> 32:18.680
is that right?

32:18.760 --> 32:19.480
The night porter claims
he didn't see anyone leave

32:19.560 --> 32:21.120
during the night.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.720
But if their job was
just to drug Gerry

32:23.800 --> 32:27.200
and cut the alarm, then they
wouldn't need to return.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.400
Alfie did the rest.

32:29.640 --> 32:30.840
If, for argument's sake,

32:30.920 --> 32:32.600
we say Alfie wasn't involved.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.880
He's handed himself in.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.120
Has he confessed?

32:35.200 --> 32:36.320
No, not yet.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.640
So, humour me.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.480
Where does a wise
man hide a leaf?

32:40.560 --> 32:42.000
Come again?

32:42.080 --> 32:42.880
In a forest.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.320
Exactly.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.440
So where would he, or
she, hide a painting?

32:53.840 --> 32:54.600
Madeleine.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.600
We know that you and
Gerry were engaged.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.120
More than just a
silly fling, then?

33:02.080 --> 33:03.400
So?

33:03.480 --> 33:04.280
Well, it must've hurt

33:04.360 --> 33:05.960
when he ended things.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.360
Actually, I ended it.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.880
He was too chaotic,
too egotistical.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.880
Prepared to do anything for fame

33:13.960 --> 33:15.960
even if it meant
trampling over others.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.200
I didn't mention it

33:18.280 --> 33:20.680
because I wasn't
sure if Lilly knew.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.480
Then you won't mind if
we search the museum

33:22.560 --> 33:24.520
and your cottage for
the missing painting?

33:26.320 --> 33:27.440
Be my guest.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.520
Perhaps Felix had better
look at Madeleine's cottage.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.440
Look, I've humoured you.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.680
We're back to where
we were, it's Alfie.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.960
He must've hidden the
painting somewhere

33:50.040 --> 33:51.440
before he handed himself in.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.160
The only problem is
he's refusing to tell us

33:53.240 --> 33:54.280
where he was lying low.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.120
Sam, there's something
I should tell you-

33:58.200 --> 33:59.520
Unless.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.760
Mrs. Clam said she
saw Alfie at breakfast

34:01.840 --> 34:04.160
which means he returned
there after the robbery.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.800
I bet it's been hidden under
our noses this whole time.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.040
Is this entirely necessary?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.480
I'm sure they'll
put everything back.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.040
I should jolly well hope so.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.320
I've already lost another
paying guest today,

34:23.400 --> 34:25.080
he barely unpacked his suitcase

34:25.160 --> 34:27.120
when he found out that a
murderer had slept in here

34:27.200 --> 34:29.320
and he beat a hasty retreat.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.920
What are you doing to my floor?

34:32.440 --> 34:34.280
Perhaps we should
wait downstairs, hm?

34:35.240 --> 34:36.000
Shall we?

34:38.200 --> 34:39.760
Sister, I think I've
found something.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.680
Oh, no, no, no, no.

34:44.760 --> 34:46.680
You mustn't contaminate
the evidence.

34:46.760 --> 34:47.600
Fine.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.760
Ah!

34:55.840 --> 34:56.920
Look at that.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.960
Perhaps Alfie Lynch
will start talking now.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.160
He did it, didn't he?

35:18.360 --> 35:20.600
Supposed to have a
deal, me and God.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.840
Only I'm starting to
think He's not listening.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.320
Oh, but He is listening!

35:27.400 --> 35:29.640
He wouldn't abandon you

35:29.720 --> 35:32.480
and you shouldn't abandon Alfie.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.000
The painting was
found in his room.

35:35.080 --> 35:36.360
So?

35:36.440 --> 35:38.320
I will find out
who put it there.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.120
Can I help?

35:46.200 --> 35:48.040
I understand you were a
friend of Gerry Ardwell's.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.360
Well, not really.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.920
But you were friends
with Robert Eddington,

35:52.000 --> 35:53.080
so this whole thing
must've brought back

35:53.160 --> 35:54.560
all sorts of painful memories.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.720
Best to talk about it.

35:59.000 --> 35:59.760
Thank you.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.280
Spiritual advisor?

36:02.360 --> 36:04.960
Yes, it's a service we offer

36:05.040 --> 36:08.320
to help you deal with your loss.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.640
-I see.
-Oh!

36:09.720 --> 36:11.200
Silly me.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.400
May I use your bathroom?

36:21.440 --> 36:22.800
Are you
alright in there?

36:22.880 --> 36:25.240
Oh. Yes.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.080
No harm done

36:27.600 --> 36:28.440
Such a...

36:30.120 --> 36:31.240
Butterfingers.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.000
Hm.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.400
All sorted.

36:47.440 --> 36:50.000
So, you wanted to
talk to me about?

36:50.080 --> 36:52.680
I just remembered I'm
needed back at the convent.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.080
Breakfast.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.120
I ain't hungry.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.720
Oh, suit yourself.

37:01.800 --> 37:02.640
I'll leave it here.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.360
Do you have a
Bible I can borrow?

37:07.760 --> 37:09.760
Somewhere, I'll
fetch it for you.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.240
Thanks, love.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.400
Someone wiser than me
said it's worth a read.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.440
And I need all the
help I can get.

37:42.000 --> 37:42.800
Bingo!

37:44.480 --> 37:45.760
I forgive you.

37:47.080 --> 37:50.520
For, if you will forgive
men their offences,

37:50.600 --> 37:53.440
your Heavenly Father will
forgive you also your offences.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.200
What is happening right now?

37:57.280 --> 37:59.280
I believe he's found God.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.200
Not another one.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.200
Lilly Ardwell has a
prescription for sleeping pills.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.720
This is not a good time.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.240
They share the same
chemical composition

38:08.320 --> 38:09.680
as the drugs given
to her husband.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.640
So Lilly was working with Alfie?

38:11.720 --> 38:12.520
No.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.480
With Francis?

38:13.560 --> 38:14.880
No.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.320
Must you look so
pleased with yourself?

38:17.400 --> 38:18.200
Yes.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.200
I can't face being
alone in that big house.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.520
Maybe you should move in.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.160
Your husband's barely cold.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.440
What would people say?

38:28.520 --> 38:29.880
Who cares?

38:29.960 --> 38:31.160
As long as we're together.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.600
I should focus on my career.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.320
But I thought-

38:36.400 --> 38:38.280
Just like you said,
just a bit of fun.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.680
Leaving us?

38:43.760 --> 38:44.920
You have the culprit?

38:46.200 --> 38:47.840
Seen this before?

38:47.920 --> 38:49.120
It's Lilly's.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.160
That's you were
doing in my bathroom?

38:51.240 --> 38:53.120
That's for personal use.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.080
Explains how Francis
was able to sneak out

38:55.160 --> 38:56.840
during the night
without waking you.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.600
The fire escape runs below
your bathroom window.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.560
He could leave without you

39:00.640 --> 39:02.160
or the night porter noticing.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.000
I never went anywhere.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.040
Oh, I think you did.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.600
You'd already drugged Gerry
with the same medication

39:11.680 --> 39:13.160
and disabled the alarm.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.200
You returned to the
museum, moved Gerry's body,

39:16.280 --> 39:17.760
then hit him round the head

39:17.840 --> 39:19.800
to make it look like
he'd disturbed a burglar.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.160
And then you stole the painting.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.880
Francis?

39:27.960 --> 39:30.320
You think I'd kill
Gerry for, for what?

39:30.400 --> 39:32.000
For money? For her?

39:32.080 --> 39:34.760
Revenge, for your
father's death.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.400
Robert Eddington,

39:36.480 --> 39:39.560
the artist whose
career Gerry destroyed.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.960
Dickie confirmed that
Robert had left behind a son

39:42.040 --> 39:43.200
who was taken into care.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.760
And you think that was me?

39:45.840 --> 39:47.680
I spoke to Mrs. Clam.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.400
When you pretended to be a guest

39:49.480 --> 39:51.280
so that you could hide the
painting in Alfie's room,

39:51.360 --> 39:54.160
you gave your name
as Mr. Eddington.

39:54.240 --> 39:57.000
Couldn't resist a final
tribute to your late father.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.520
If I'd stolen a
priceless artwork,

39:58.600 --> 40:00.560
why dump it in a guesthouse?

40:00.640 --> 40:03.160
To make sure that someone else
was blamed for the murder.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.720
I'm sure if we
hadn't have found it,

40:04.800 --> 40:06.560
we would have received
an anonymous tip off.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.040
And you can prove
all this, can you?

40:08.120 --> 40:09.800
Mrs. Clam seemed very confident

40:09.880 --> 40:11.600
she could identify you.

40:11.680 --> 40:14.000
And while you were careful
at the murder scene

40:14.080 --> 40:15.960
to remove any fingerprints,

40:16.040 --> 40:17.880
the guest house was
a different matter.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.160
You were in a rush,

40:19.240 --> 40:21.080
and like the Inspector
here, struggled

40:21.160 --> 40:24.160
to lift up the base of the
chest of drawers wearing gloves.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.040
So you took them off,
only for one moment.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.240
Well, as far as
performance pieces go,

40:49.320 --> 40:50.840
I think Gerry would
have approved.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.960
At least I had shock value.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.840
This isn't a joke, Mr. Scritton.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.760
Maybe you're right.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.440
Gerry never cared
about art, anyway.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.440
He wanted fame.

41:01.360 --> 41:02.880
That's all.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.480
He sabotaged my father's career,

41:04.560 --> 41:06.840
destroyed my life,
to make that happen.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.120
So you got a job with him

41:08.200 --> 41:09.920
so you could take your revenge.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.160
I'm only sorry he wasn't awake

41:12.240 --> 41:13.480
when I smashed his head in.

41:14.880 --> 41:15.920
Francis Scritton,
I'm arresting you

41:16.000 --> 41:17.240
for the murder of Gerry Ardwell.

41:17.320 --> 41:18.520
You do not need to say anything

41:18.600 --> 41:20.400
but anything you do say
will be written down

41:20.480 --> 41:21.560
and given in evidence.

41:32.200 --> 41:32.960
For the record,

41:34.320 --> 41:36.040
I'm sorry about what
happened to your mate.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.840
The copper, if I could go back-

41:37.920 --> 41:39.760
Just keep your word.

41:39.840 --> 41:40.600
Go straight.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.760
Come here!

41:58.840 --> 42:01.400
Cor! You need a wash
and a change of clothes.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.160
And before you ask, you're
not borrowing any of mine.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.880
Thanks, Bridy.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.120
For never giving up on me.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.040
I had my moments.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.600
For which I'm sorry.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.960
So, I've been on the
blower to your Maggie.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.200
She's gonna give you another go.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.080
How did you manage that?

42:21.160 --> 42:22.600
Oh, your sister can
be very persuasive

42:22.680 --> 42:23.880
when she wants to be.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.200
No messing, though.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.520
One hint of mischief,
you're out on your ear.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.160
Good as gold, me.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.080
Here, I've even
started reading this.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.240
Did you steal that from
the police station?

42:37.480 --> 42:39.240
Borrowed it.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.560
Bridy, ow!

42:40.640 --> 42:43.160
-Just get over here!
-Ow!

42:43.240 --> 42:45.880
Bridy, alright,
I'll take it back!

42:52.920 --> 42:55.240
Revered Mother Adrian
told me about the murder.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.360
I was going to
offer my assistance.

42:58.720 --> 43:00.560
But I see that you had
everything in hand.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.080
How about I tell you
all the gory details

43:06.160 --> 43:07.200
over a nice cup of tea?

43:08.480 --> 43:10.600
I can think of nothing
more enjoyable.
