00:33.158 --> 00:35.201
Man, five days of rain
in a row.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.620
I mean, I like the creek,
but not when it's on my face.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.166
Ugh. I know. My jersey feels
like a weighted blanket.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.251
Oh.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.586
Well, at least
we have the dry,

00:44.586 --> 00:47.672
quiet sanctuary
of the library to...

00:47.756 --> 00:52.010
Gotcha!

00:59.309 --> 01:02.437
I guess the whole creek
had the same idea.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.063
This place
is falling apart!

01:04.147 --> 01:07.066
How can Harold the librarian
stand for this!

01:10.779 --> 01:14.491
Just promise to
bring 'em back eventually.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.159
Pathetic.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.494
When the kid uprising begins,

01:17.494 --> 01:19.579
you'll be the first to fall.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.747
Agh!

01:20.747 --> 01:21.664
Huh?

01:22.999 --> 01:24.417
Uh, is that allowed?

01:24.501 --> 01:27.045
Uh, I dunno.
I don't wanna get in trouble.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.087
It's the Stacks Signal!

01:28.171 --> 01:30.423
Come on!
We've been summoned!

01:31.925 --> 01:33.259
Stacks: <i>Disculpa.</i>

01:33.343 --> 01:34.969
That's my seat.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.514
I will never
understand why

01:37.514 --> 01:40.350
people bring their pets
into the library!

01:41.893 --> 01:45.021
The library is a special place,
and nobody is respecting it!

01:46.314 --> 01:49.025
Whoops, looks like I left
my backpack open.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.027
Books got
a little soggy.

01:52.195 --> 01:55.365
We should probably
put these in some rice.

01:55.365 --> 01:59.786
I swear, this
is enough to awaken <i>La Llorona.</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:00.995
Who?

02:01.079 --> 02:03.456
Oh, you've never heard of her?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.875
Let me tell you
the harrowing tale of

02:05.959 --> 02:08.878
<i>La Llorona
del Biblioteca...</i>

02:08.962 --> 02:12.382
the tale of
librarian scorned.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.844
Stacks: Once upon a time, there
was an overworked librarian

02:15.844 --> 02:19.597
who was terrorized
by misbehaving children.

02:19.681 --> 02:24.102
Until one day
she was pushed too far.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.521
Thousands of books were ruined,

02:26.521 --> 02:29.858
and the librarian
swore revenge.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.235
She chased the children
into the woods

02:32.235 --> 02:34.863
and cast them into the creek!

02:34.863 --> 02:37.740
Never to be heard from
again...

02:37.824 --> 02:41.953
And even though many years have
past since that terrible day,

02:41.953 --> 02:45.748
they say that whenever
library property is damaged,

02:45.832 --> 02:48.710
the ghost of <i>La Llorona</i>
rises out of the creek

02:48.710 --> 02:50.837
to take revenge!

02:53.423 --> 02:55.300
S-So what happened
to the kids?

02:55.300 --> 02:58.011
They were fine right?
Right?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.096
They were cast into the creek,
Craig.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.557
Cast into the creek!

03:02.557 --> 03:05.143
Don't worry.
It's just a story.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.769
But maybe...

03:06.853 --> 03:08.271
Nah.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.773
Neat stuff like that
only happens in books.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.741
Uh-oh.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.334
Do you think that could be...?

03:29.334 --> 03:31.169
Let's go investigate.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.339
Harold...

03:34.339 --> 03:36.257
He's gone!

03:36.341 --> 03:39.677
Look, soggy footprints!

03:41.888 --> 03:43.139
Oh, my gosh!
It's her!

03:43.139 --> 03:45.266
<i>La Llorona!</i>
Something is happening!

03:45.350 --> 03:46.893
Something is finally happening!

03:46.893 --> 03:48.436
Oh. Oh, my gosh.
So cool...

03:48.436 --> 03:50.063
Anyways, we should
get out of here.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.649
Wait! We can't hide!
People are in danger!

03:52.649 --> 03:55.485
We've got to warn our fellow
creek kids before it's too late.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.488
Let's split up.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.488
Good idea. We should
do it by section.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.156
Me and Kelsey
will take fiction.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.741
Craig, take
science and nature.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.410
And JP, do a sweep
of the story corner.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.955
We're gonna
get this ghost!

04:09.499 --> 04:11.668
Benny?
Paintball Benny-y-y?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.127
Where are you?

04:13.211 --> 04:15.421
Benny!
Aah! Who's there!

04:15.505 --> 04:16.673
It's me, Craig.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.841
I can't see you, man,
where are you?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.551
All I can see are books!

04:20.635 --> 04:23.388
Not so loud!
You'll get caught by <i>La Llorona.</i>

04:23.388 --> 04:25.014
La Ll-what?

04:27.350 --> 04:28.518
Huh?

04:29.852 --> 04:31.688
Aah!

04:37.694 --> 04:40.238
There there, little bud,
it's just a bit of thunder.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.198
Besides, the junk
will protect us.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.577
Junk Lord!
We gotta go.

04:46.661 --> 04:47.704
We gotta --

04:48.955 --> 04:49.872
Aah!

04:51.416 --> 04:52.834
No!

04:57.130 --> 04:58.548
Oh.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.726
Kelsey: <i>La Llorona</i>
already got Sewer Queen!

05:12.395 --> 05:13.896
I think we're next!

05:13.980 --> 05:15.106
I mean...

05:15.106 --> 05:17.900
Oh, creek!
I think we're next.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.193
Absolutely not!

05:19.277 --> 05:20.737
Come on!

05:24.240 --> 05:25.533
Oh, no.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.660
I can't believe I led us
to a dead end!

05:27.744 --> 05:29.704
That's so corny!

05:35.418 --> 05:37.170
Mortimer!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.422
Ew, he pooped.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.590
Huh? Aah!

05:40.590 --> 05:41.591
Kelsey!

05:44.010 --> 05:46.721
I don't understand!
Why is she after you?

05:46.721 --> 05:48.765
We both love
and respect books!

05:48.765 --> 05:51.476
Stacks, there's something
you don't know about me.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.602
I...

05:52.602 --> 05:56.522
I have overdue books
from the library!

05:58.191 --> 05:59.442
I can't help it,
okay!

05:59.442 --> 06:00.985
It's really hard to
find odd number volumes

06:01.069 --> 06:02.987
at the store for some reason,
so I just keep them

06:03.071 --> 06:05.114
for an excessively
long period of time!

06:05.198 --> 06:10.995
Aah!
No!

06:11.079 --> 06:13.122
Tell my story-y-y!

06:13.206 --> 06:15.291
Kelsey-y-y-y!

06:21.881 --> 06:23.257
Sorry, it's just me.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.051
Did you have any luck
saving the other kids?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.844
Where's Kelsey?

06:26.928 --> 06:29.138
I...
I lost her!

06:29.222 --> 06:31.557
She and all the other kids
are gone.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.684
I was afraid of that.

06:33.768 --> 06:37.605
When I went to look for JP,
this was all I found.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.607
I think we're
the only two left.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.192
This is terrible.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.486
We really are in a horror story
right now!

06:43.486 --> 06:46.364
And I fell for the ol'
tragic romance trope.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.990
Just like the protagonist

06:48.074 --> 06:50.159
in "Interview with
the Swamp Monster."

06:50.243 --> 06:53.788
Sweet tragedy makes
the journey worth living!

06:53.788 --> 06:55.915
Are you enjoying this?

06:55.915 --> 06:56.833
No.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.584
This is terrible.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.752
I said that, right?

06:59.836 --> 07:01.254
Yes, terrible.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.922
Well, you can have
all the fun you want,

07:02.922 --> 07:05.424
but I'm not gonna stand here
and let this story play out.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.676
We gotta fight back!

07:06.676 --> 07:08.261
There's gotta be something
we can do.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.139
How does the story of <i>La
Llorona del Biblioteca</i> end?

07:11.139 --> 07:14.308
Her story doesn't just "end."
It's folklore.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.978
My <i>tias</i> have always said
that we tell these stories

07:16.978 --> 07:18.604
to keep the past alive.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.190
This library,
these books...

07:21.274 --> 07:23.734
These are capsules
of souls long past,

07:23.818 --> 07:26.737
whose stories continue to live
on through the pages.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.615
I want to be someone who takes
care of these stories.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.910
Scary or not,
they deserve to be told.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.538
I was the one who told you
the story of <i>La Llorona</i>

07:35.538 --> 07:37.165
and let her out of the book.

07:37.165 --> 07:41.127
So maybe if I was able to lure
her out of the book,

07:41.127 --> 07:43.045
I can put her back in!

07:43.129 --> 07:45.256
Huh. It's worth a shot.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.550
I know just what we can use
to trap her inside.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.552
But we need to
draw her to us.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.887
Just leave that to me.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.930
She only comes after
naughty children

07:53.014 --> 07:54.932
who abuse library materials.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.893
I know what I must do.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.279
<i>La Llorona del Biblioteca!</i>

08:08.279 --> 08:09.989
I call upon thee!

08:09.989 --> 08:12.158
From one kindred spirit
to another,

08:12.158 --> 08:14.619
I beg of you,
bring back my friends

08:14.619 --> 08:16.537
and leave this world
in peace!

08:16.621 --> 08:18.956
Your spirit has overstayed
its welcome

08:19.040 --> 08:22.043
and has captured those
who I hold dear.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.588
And for that,
you must be punished!

08:25.588 --> 08:28.174
Sorry about this,
Mary Shelley.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.760
Aah!

08:39.519 --> 08:41.520
So cool.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.981
Now, Craig!

08:44.065 --> 08:44.941
Aah!

08:47.443 --> 08:48.444
The lights are back.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.695
It must have worked!

08:49.779 --> 08:51.155
Huh?
Wait, what?

08:51.239 --> 08:53.115
<i>La Llorona</i> is alive!

08:53.199 --> 08:54.116
Ugh!

08:54.200 --> 08:55.326
<i>La Llorona?</i>

08:55.326 --> 08:56.869
My name is Lorraine.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.455
And why'd you glue a book
to my face?

08:59.455 --> 09:02.792
We were trying to stick you
back into it, obviously.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.711
You're...
You're not a ghost?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.755
I don't know what ghost

09:07.755 --> 09:09.298
you're talking about.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.677
I'm just here as a substitute
librarian for Harold.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.803
Substitute?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.433
Achoo!

09:19.517 --> 09:23.437
<i>Pobrecito,</i> Harold,
please go home already.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.023
That cold
sounds just awful.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.525
Yeah, I know.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.486
I think I sneezed a piece
of my brain out in the sink.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.656
Thank you so much for stepping
in on such short notice,

09:33.656 --> 09:35.157
Miss Murillo.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.118
Wait, if you aren't
a ghost,

09:37.118 --> 09:38.869
then what happened
to the creek kids?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.496
Kelsey: Yo, Craiggy!

09:40.496 --> 09:41.998
We've been looking for you
everywhere.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.416
Lorraine grabbed a couple of us

09:43.416 --> 09:45.293
and said she'd give us
sparkly blue stickers

09:45.293 --> 09:47.128
if we helped her
clean up the library.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.213
I got a kitty.
Don't be jealous.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.923
I got one that looks
like Mortimer.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.466
Uh, but, Kelsey,

09:52.550 --> 09:55.845
I saw you get grabbed
through a bookcase!

09:55.845 --> 09:57.471
Yep, you sure did.

09:57.555 --> 10:01.517
And I'll do it again if you
don't return all those books!

10:01.517 --> 10:02.935
Wait, so...

10:03.019 --> 10:05.229
<i>La Llorona</i> wasn't real?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.106
There isn't a monster?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.108
I think the only monsters
around here

10:09.108 --> 10:11.819
are the kids making
a mess in the library.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.823
But...
I've got hot cocoa

10:15.823 --> 10:17.199
for anyone who can help me

10:17.283 --> 10:20.036
put these go-back books
where they belong.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.954
We can help with that.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.165
I'd like that very much.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.711
I just don't get it.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.714
I really thought
I saw a ghost back there.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.674
I'm glad
everybody's safe.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.468
But if books
have taught me anything,

10:35.468 --> 10:37.470
it's that anything
can happen.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.557
I guess... I just wanted to see
some of that come alive.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.185
Well, I think as long as you
keep searching for stories

10:44.185 --> 10:46.062
and sharing them
with friends,

10:46.062 --> 10:48.189
cool stuff
can always come alive.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.566
Now I wish I hadn't
ripped that book.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.652
You two better be kinder
to your books.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.572
They don't just hold stories,
y'know.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.158
Books also hold...

10:59.158 --> 11:01.410
grudges!
