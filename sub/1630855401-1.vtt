WEBVTT

00:59.680 --> 01:03.400
There is scarcely
another period in history

01:03.480 --> 01:05.800
where freedom and oppression

01:05.880 --> 01:10.800
are as close to each other
as in the 1920s and 1930s.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.880
It was a calamity for humankind.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.520
And I was part of that humankind.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.720
The Eldorado heralds a new freedom

02:33.800 --> 02:36.840
where gay men, lesbian women,

02:36.920 --> 02:41.600
trans men and trans women can be free
and self-determined for the first time.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.480
In Berlin's nightlife,
we see two new faces:

03:19.120 --> 03:23.360
Lisa and Gottfried,
newly married, in their early twenties,

03:23.440 --> 03:27.880
like so many who visit the Eldorado
they are ready to just drift along,

03:27.960 --> 03:30.960
to discover new things,
to discover new loves.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.280
Lisa, full name Lisa von Dobeneck,

03:40.360 --> 03:44.080
and Gottfried von Cramm
have known each other since childhood.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.240
They grew up in neighboring castles.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.680
Lisa was a born Dobeneck.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.880
And they lived 15 kilometers
from one of our estates.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.560
It was called the "Babylon of Sin"

03:57.640 --> 04:01.360
because it's where the Cramms
were free to do anything.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.080
Lisa and Gottfried want the big life.

04:08.160 --> 04:13.320
And of course that eventually stops
happening in this rural environment

04:13.400 --> 04:15.960
but instead in the magnet of wild Berlin.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.280
ABOLISH PARAGRAPH 218

04:36.160 --> 04:38.480
THE GIRLFRIEND
WOMEN LOVE

04:39.640 --> 04:41.120
THE ISLAND

04:41.200 --> 04:42.760
WOMEN'S LOVE

04:42.840 --> 04:44.360
THE GIRLFRIEND

04:44.440 --> 04:45.840
THE THIRD SEX

05:00.480 --> 05:05.000
This is the first time Lisa and Gottfried
discover a world unknown to them.

05:05.080 --> 05:09.800
The Eldorado was synonymous with the fact
that something new was beginning here.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.480
…with swastika flags blowing
all across the Reich today…

06:11.360 --> 06:16.960
Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm meet as early
as 1919 in the right-wing movement.

06:17.040 --> 06:21.360
They very quickly become friends
on a first-name basis

06:21.440 --> 06:23.960
and have a close friendship for years.

06:24.040 --> 06:27.360
… to stand strong for all eternity.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.440
ELDORADO
HERE IT IS RIGHT!

07:55.560 --> 07:58.880
Men out of the Reichstag!

07:58.960 --> 08:01.960
And men out of the Landtag

08:02.040 --> 08:05.240
And men out of the manor

08:05.320 --> 08:08.320
We'll make it into a women's house

09:49.760 --> 09:52.360
Magnus Hirschfeld also frequents
the Eldorado.

09:52.440 --> 09:56.080
He loves observing queer life.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.840
TRANSVESTITES:
THE EROTIC DRESS-UP IMPULSE

10:43.600 --> 10:46.520
On the queer city map of Berlin,

10:46.600 --> 10:51.160
there is one focal point
for progressive thinking:

10:51.240 --> 10:55.040
Magnus Hirschfeld's
Institute for Sexual Science.

11:52.280 --> 11:55.120
For Ernst Röhm,
Magnus Hirschfeld embodies the enemy.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.680
He is Jewish, a social democrat,

11:57.760 --> 12:02.240
and he championed the rights
of trans men and trans women.

12:02.320 --> 12:07.200
As such, he is the opposite
of the masculine ideology

12:07.280 --> 12:09.560
that Ernst Röhm adheres to.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.200
But both have something in common,
they are not openly homosexual.

12:14.280 --> 12:19.320
Magnus Hirschfeld knows that he would lose
his reputation as a scientist.

12:19.400 --> 12:23.760
And Ernst Röhm knows that he
would be expelled from the Nazi Party.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.760
"Dear Dr. Heimsoth."

12:50.360 --> 12:51.960
"A handshake first of all."

12:53.000 --> 12:56.400
"I can remember a number
of same-sex feelings and acts

12:56.480 --> 12:58.280
reaching back to my childhood,

12:58.360 --> 13:01.280
but I have also associated
with many women."

13:01.360 --> 13:03.960
"Never, however,
to my particular enjoyment."

13:20.840 --> 13:22.800
"All women are loathsome to me."

13:22.880 --> 13:25.840
"I am not at all unhappy
about my disposition,

13:25.920 --> 13:30.840
even if it has caused me
considerable difficulties at times."

13:30.920 --> 13:33.480
"Internally, I may even be proud of it."

13:34.120 --> 13:35.720
"At least I believe so."

13:41.760 --> 13:45.520
WITH A COMPANIONABLE HANDSHAKE
YOURS, ERNST RÖHM

14:09.800 --> 14:12.840
But there is also another reality.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.360
After all, Germany does not only
consist of cities,

14:15.440 --> 14:18.520
but a large part of it is towns, villages.

14:19.480 --> 14:24.440
For those, what is happening in Berlin
and other major cities is alien.

14:24.520 --> 14:29.720
The also feel intimidated
by this rapid change.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.440
We want to school the Germans

15:05.520 --> 15:09.800
insofar as that there is no life
without law

15:10.400 --> 15:13.520
and that there is no law without power

15:13.600 --> 15:16.840
and there is no power without strength

15:16.920 --> 15:21.160
and that any strength
has to be rooted in our own nation!

15:21.240 --> 15:26.360
He sounded to me like Hitler always
sounded when he gave a speech,

15:26.440 --> 15:28.320
like a madman.

15:28.400 --> 15:31.560
The yelling and the things he said.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.720
And of course he talked about the Jews,
yes.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.840
It was a horrible thing to listen to.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.200
I didn't concern myself with it
any further.

15:45.760 --> 15:50.280
I was an innocent young man.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.200
I had fallen in love, you see.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.840
We had a villa in Sauerbrunn

16:06.920 --> 16:09.840
where we spent our summers.

16:11.960 --> 16:17.280
And someone else who went there on holiday
every year was Lumpi.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.960
That's how I met him.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.960
He lived in Budapest
and I lived in Vienna.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.520
Lumpi and I became friends.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.680
We did a lot of stuff together.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.440
I loved him. After all, why not?

16:44.680 --> 16:46.440
We were both Jewish.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.240
But we didn't give it much thought.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.920
We were pretty removed from it all,
as you'd put it.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.280
But the trouble was in the air.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.920
Not just in Berlin or in Germany,
but everywhere in Europe.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.960
The SA recruited its members

18:26.040 --> 18:31.280
mostly among young men from lower class
and lower middle-classes.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.120
Because of its relatively low-threshold
admission criteria,

18:35.200 --> 18:38.160
it didn't consist
of only radical nationalists,

18:38.240 --> 18:42.520
but also of outsiders, eccentrics
and quite a number of criminals.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.120
The storm trooper, Karl Ernst,
worked in Berlin,

19:08.200 --> 19:12.960
sometimes as a doorman in gay and lesbian
nightclubs, sometimes as a bellhop.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.720
To the movement!

20:31.800 --> 20:35.320
There is one man in the Nazi movement

20:35.400 --> 20:38.800
whose dangerousness
Ernst Röhm underestimated for a long time.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.960
That is the Reich Leader of the SS,
Heinrich Himmler.

20:43.880 --> 20:48.440
As a young person, Heinrich Himmler
was very interested

20:48.520 --> 20:50.800
in this kind of
fraternity-based comradeship

20:50.880 --> 20:55.280
But at the same time he always feared
the danger inherent in the possibility

20:55.360 --> 20:59.200
of these manly friendships
giving rise to erotic attraction.

21:01.680 --> 21:06.440
At this point in time, Himmler was
the leader of the SS, the Schutzstaffel.

21:15.800 --> 21:20.160
To distance himself from the SA,
which is widely decried as homosexual,

21:20.240 --> 21:25.600
he plans to forge this SS
into an elite organization.

21:25.680 --> 21:30.280
For him, that includes that its members
should ideally be blond and blue-eyed.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.080
So he invariably seems to consider
external criteria

21:33.160 --> 21:35.960
to be an ostensible proof
of "good Aryan blood".

21:47.600 --> 21:51.240
Gottfried von Cramm becomes a star
during those years.

21:53.120 --> 21:57.400
After two extremely close games,
the German champion tears a muscle,

21:57.480 --> 22:01.480
and from then on
cannot really resist Perry.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.480
Gottfried started playing tennis
at the age of ten,

22:05.560 --> 22:10.120
and at 13 he decided that he would become
the best tennis player in the world.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.320
The moment he gets to Berlin,

22:13.400 --> 22:17.520
he immediately joins
this very famous tennis club, "Rot-Weiß".

22:18.120 --> 22:22.240
And one of its members is Hermann Göring,

22:22.320 --> 22:26.400
the eventual Interior Minister
of the Nazi government.

22:27.760 --> 22:31.000
Gottfried is a handsome man, a tall man.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.840
He has blue eyes, blond hair.

22:34.360 --> 22:38.440
He embodies the prototype of an Aryan.

22:38.520 --> 22:43.040
And he gets prompted early on
to become a member of the Nazi Party.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.920
We know that Gottfried refuses,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
and of course over the years
that becomes more and more of a problem.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.040
Of course we don't know any details
about how the meeting comes about.

23:13.120 --> 23:17.600
But we do know that Gottfried
meets a young man,

23:17.680 --> 23:19.920
of a similarly young age as Gottfried.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.600
This young man is called Manasse,
Manasse Herbst.

23:28.560 --> 23:34.440
Gottfried and Manasse certainly come
from very different worlds.

23:34.520 --> 23:39.280
Manasse comes from a Jewish family
in the poor Scheunenviertel.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.280
He's an actor.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.960
But to make ends meet,
he works as a bartender at the Jockey,

23:46.040 --> 23:50.400
a small jazz bar
a few blocks from the Eldorado.

23:51.480 --> 23:55.400
Maybe there was a moment of recognition.

24:11.600 --> 24:16.680
There exists a genuine threat
for homosexual men: Paragraph 175.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.880
The paragraph criminalizes
homosexual relations between men.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.200
But it is tricky in its application

24:27.280 --> 24:33.880
since many courts demand proof
of coital acts.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.520
And that isn't exactly
an easy task for the police.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.160
A lot of the time
you didn't know you were on one of them,

24:57.240 --> 24:59.200
because you never ended up being charged.

24:59.280 --> 25:03.280
But we know that the pink lists eventually
had thousands of names written on them.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.120
FIRST NAME: JOSEF
CRIMINAL CATEGORY: § 175

25:06.960 --> 25:09.360
But Gottfried possesses
this inner freedom,

25:09.440 --> 25:11.320
that if he falls in love,

25:11.400 --> 25:12.960
he pursues that love.

25:18.280 --> 25:22.600
After their first meeting, Gottfried
and Manasse see each other regularly.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.200
Of course, Lisa knows all about it.

25:27.840 --> 25:32.200
There is no being secretive; instead
it is all being lived out in the open.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.360
What are you doing?

25:40.800 --> 25:42.920
Come here! Come on!

25:43.720 --> 25:49.080
And the three of them now start
a new type of relationship,

25:49.160 --> 25:52.200
which apparently works well, too.

26:01.960 --> 26:06.360
For Lisa,
the move to Berlin is also liberating.

26:06.440 --> 26:10.400
She wants to live independently,
and experience herself in a new way.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.800
And she very quickly forms friendships

26:12.880 --> 26:17.560
with the modern women
that this Berlin has created.

26:17.640 --> 26:21.480
With female authors, with female athletes,
with female photographers.

26:21.560 --> 26:25.040
It's important to note,
Lisa also does photography herself.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.800
She's an avid jazz dancer,
she's an avid equestrian,

26:28.880 --> 26:32.000
she plays hockey
and even becomes the German champion.

26:33.960 --> 26:39.000
And this stems from a deeper movement
that began even before the 1920s

26:39.080 --> 26:40.360
where you free yourself

26:40.440 --> 26:44.280
from this "being confined by clothes,
by houses."

26:45.440 --> 26:48.880
So she has this tough way of speaking
and goes her own way.

26:51.560 --> 26:56.320
Relatively quickly, she had affairs,
also with lesbian friends.

26:56.400 --> 27:00.640
She was curious, had a sexual thirst
for adventure that she lived freely.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.240
The relationship
between Gottfried and Lisa

27:41.320 --> 27:46.880
is one that is characterized by this
almost endless trust in each other,

27:46.960 --> 27:50.560
that whatever one does, it is okay.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.160
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN GERMANY

28:09.840 --> 28:11.400
Shortly before they seize power,

28:11.480 --> 28:16.280
the Nazis once again significantly
increased their street terror.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.880
There were massive street fights
with fatal casualties.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.480
The purpose behind all of this

28:22.560 --> 28:27.600
was to attempt to demonstrate
the instability of democracy.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.480
And they presented themselves
as the part of law and order

28:32.560 --> 28:35.240
that, after winning the election,

28:35.320 --> 28:38.280
would once again restore
security, order and peace.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.240
TAKE TO THE STREETS!
ADOLF HITLER

28:43.320 --> 28:45.120
It is not so much fear

28:45.200 --> 28:49.160
that the people associate with the Nazis

28:49.240 --> 28:53.520
but the hope for a reinvigorated Germany

28:54.440 --> 28:57.440
and the promise of a golden future.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.320
Hello, good evening.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.480
A few years later I went to Budapest

33:12.560 --> 33:15.160
to spend my Easter holidays there

33:15.240 --> 33:18.920
and I stayed with Lumpi,
in the Andrássy út,

33:19.480 --> 33:22.440
I don't remember the street number,
near the opera.

33:26.920 --> 33:31.120
During that first visit,
we were up to so many shenanigans.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.600
They didn't have a real bathroom.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.480
They had this,
what we in Vienna called a "lavor".

33:45.760 --> 33:47.800
His mom would fill it with water

33:47.880 --> 33:52.960
and put us both, naked,
into this bathtub, see?

33:56.040 --> 34:02.320
And as Lumpi saw me, he got a boner.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.400
As he saw me naked. I did notice it.

34:07.080 --> 34:11.480
But we didn't touch each other sexually.

34:11.560 --> 34:16.320
But I was always very flustered.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.080
In the early 30s,

34:33.159 --> 34:36.719
Hitler tries to come to power
through legal means

34:36.800 --> 34:42.000
by using as much propaganda as possible
to get people's votes

34:42.080 --> 34:46.040
and to take over parliament
in order to then destroy it from within.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.480
On January 30th,

37:57.400 --> 38:00.120
the die has been cast in Germany.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.040
And I do not believe

38:04.160 --> 38:09.560
that the enemies who were laughing
back then are still laughing today.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.360
Sieg!

38:14.440 --> 38:15.520
Heil!

38:16.320 --> 38:17.760
-Sieg!
-Heil!

38:18.360 --> 38:23.400
On January 30th, 1933,
Hitler is appointed chancellor.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.920
REICH CHANCELLOR HITLER!

38:37.600 --> 38:41.040
Hitler becomes the Führer
of his totalitarian regime.

39:08.400 --> 39:12.920
The Nazi ideology has no use
at all anymore

39:13.000 --> 39:15.560
for determining your life individually.

39:15.640 --> 39:19.160
Instead everything is only ever subject
to a higher idea.

39:19.240 --> 39:22.080
Every individual
in this national community

39:22.160 --> 39:25.760
has to defer to this higher purpose.

40:00.120 --> 40:04.240
Shortly before the Nazis even seize power,
the Eldorado is closed down.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.920
No farewells, no send-off.

40:09.360 --> 40:14.880
And the queer community loses
one of its most important ports of call.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.920
And then, to go from bad to worse,

40:39.000 --> 40:43.720
the Eldorado is used
as advertising space for the Nazis.

40:44.560 --> 40:48.640
ELDORADO
HERE IT IS RIGHT!

40:48.720 --> 40:50.640
VOTE FOR HITLER - LIST 1

41:35.800 --> 41:37.040
In 1933,

41:37.120 --> 41:42.640
the life that Gottfried and Manasse
had led also changes drastically.

41:45.280 --> 41:48.960
Manasse very quickly loses
all his theater engagements

41:49.040 --> 41:52.120
because as a Jew he is no longer allowed
to work in the theater.

41:52.200 --> 41:58.280
He realizes very early on
that he is no longer safe in Germany.

42:00.320 --> 42:04.760
Everyone is aware
that the situation is quickly escalating.

42:07.640 --> 42:10.920
More and more, the relationship
is overshadowed by the question,

42:11.000 --> 42:14.040
how can Manasse safely get out of Germany?

42:16.360 --> 42:18.720
But Gottfried wants to play tennis.

42:20.400 --> 42:24.880
And if that means
he has to play tennis in Nazi Germany,

42:24.960 --> 42:26.760
then he will play for Germany.

42:28.400 --> 42:29.760
The pressure is mounting.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.480
He has a romantic relationship
with a homosexual Jew.

42:33.560 --> 42:37.480
But at the same time
his popularity also grows,

42:37.560 --> 42:40.240
both nationally and internationally.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.400
And maybe he's thinking
that as long as he keeps winning,

42:44.480 --> 42:47.480
the regime can't touch him.

42:49.920 --> 42:54.320
And with Cramm's decision to play
for Germany, there was no other option.

44:00.560 --> 44:04.200
Magnus Hirschfeld meanwhile
is on a tour of the world.

44:09.200 --> 44:12.760
While he can't make public appearances
in Germany anymore,

44:12.840 --> 44:15.400
he's still being celebrated
internationally.

44:22.800 --> 44:27.160
THE PRETTY MAGNUS HIRSCHFELD,
BIGGEST TURNIP PIG OF THE 20TH CENTURY

46:28.280 --> 46:32.280
I consign to the flames
the writings of Heinrich Mann,

46:32.360 --> 46:35.640
Ernst Glaeser, Erich Kästner.

46:36.680 --> 46:40.640
I consign to the flames the writings
of the School of Sigmund Freud…

49:19.360 --> 49:21.280
MY DEAR CHIEF OF STAFF!

49:57.600 --> 49:59.280
At the beginning of 1934,

49:59.360 --> 50:02.240
the SA has reached
its highest member count

50:02.320 --> 50:05.280
with approximately 4.5 million members.

50:07.640 --> 50:11.640
It has become something that
is increasingly causing Hitler problems.

50:32.800 --> 50:35.400
It seems to Heinrich Himmler
that the moment has come

50:35.480 --> 50:40.400
to lead his SS out of the shadow
of Ernst Röhm and his SA

50:40.480 --> 50:43.040
and to expand his own position of power.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.120
-Get dressed!
-Out!

52:56.600 --> 52:58.800
Two days later Hitler decided

52:58.880 --> 53:02.800
to make Röhm the offer
that he should shoot himself.

53:14.880 --> 53:17.280
Only after Röhm refuses to kill himself

53:17.360 --> 53:19.640
is he shot dead by two SS captains.

53:36.560 --> 53:39.360
On June 30th and the following two days,

53:39.440 --> 53:42.640
a total of around 90 people are shot,

53:42.720 --> 53:45.000
around 1,000 people are arrested.

53:45.080 --> 53:49.120
Among them aren't only Ernst Röhm
and some of his SA men,

53:49.200 --> 53:52.320
but political opponents
and members of parliament.

53:53.120 --> 53:57.320
It is the regime's
first state-sanctioned mass murder.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.720
Hitler welcomed the SA murders,

54:17.800 --> 54:21.920
saying that the sexual debauchery inside
the SA had recently increased so much

54:22.000 --> 54:25.680
that it supposedly damaged
t he reputation of National Socialism.

54:59.400 --> 55:02.600
It was a huge, a huge scandal.

55:02.680 --> 55:05.960
It was on the front page
of every newspaper.

55:06.040 --> 55:08.560
I gave the order to shoot

55:08.640 --> 55:13.920
the chief culprits of this treason,

55:14.000 --> 55:20.000
and I gave the order to burn out these
ulcers of our internal well poisoning

55:20.080 --> 55:22.080
and the poisoning from foreign countries.

55:22.160 --> 55:24.800
I must have heard it on the radio,

55:24.880 --> 55:29.440
because I have a very clear memory
of that moment

55:29.520 --> 55:33.800
that I found out what happened there.

55:33.880 --> 55:36.680
It, it frightened you.

55:36.760 --> 55:42.040
No matter if you were homosexual
or not homosexual.

55:42.120 --> 55:45.880
As a human…
It could have happened to anyone.

55:48.880 --> 55:52.080
And it showed who Hitler was.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.360
Due to the SS
committing the murders of the SA,

56:05.440 --> 56:09.880
Himmler has once again clearly proven
his loyalty to Hitler.

56:10.480 --> 56:14.160
And Hitler thanks him
by satisfying Himmler's wish

56:14.240 --> 56:16.560
and separating the SS from the SA.

56:16.640 --> 56:19.480
It is now directly under Hitler's command.

56:21.800 --> 56:24.800
Which is what Heinrich Himmler
had wanted all along.

56:26.880 --> 56:33.720
This ultimately creates the basis
of Himmler's rise and career.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.480
After the Röhm murders,

56:37.560 --> 56:42.480
he bit by bit takes over the leadership of
the political police in all German states

56:42.560 --> 56:46.000
until he eventually becomes both
chief of the whole of the German police

56:46.080 --> 56:49.400
as well as Reich leader
of the SS and Gestapo.

56:53.560 --> 56:57.320
Heinrich Himmler becomes the leader
of the fight against homosexuality.

56:57.400 --> 57:00.960
His goal is to eradicate homosexuality.

57:01.840 --> 57:04.480
"Homosexuality
tears down any accomplishment

57:04.560 --> 57:07.280
and destroys the state
in its very foundation."

57:07.360 --> 57:09.800
"For only the nation
that has a great many children

57:09.880 --> 57:13.120
has an entitlement
to world power and world domination."

57:13.680 --> 57:16.920
"Homosexuality
has to be combated at all costs,

57:17.000 --> 57:21.200
otherwise it will be the end of Germany,
the end of the Germanic world."

57:21.280 --> 57:23.840
It is the sword of the revolution

57:25.520 --> 57:28.560
that the only enemy
no longer causing damage

57:29.440 --> 57:32.480
is the one who is dead
and who is annihilated.

57:33.240 --> 57:36.840
The pink lists previously compiled
by the police

57:36.920 --> 57:40.000
now not only fall
into the hands of the German police,

57:40.080 --> 57:42.440
but also the hands of the Gestapo.

57:47.600 --> 57:54.400
There is then a wave of persecution
and sentencing like never seen before.

57:57.040 --> 58:02.240
…IN RESPECT TO HOMOSEXUALITY…

58:19.320 --> 58:21.440
Many, I think, were also surprised

58:21.520 --> 58:24.400
by how quickly the police stepped in,

58:24.480 --> 58:27.160
how quickly you ended up in court.

58:27.760 --> 58:29.960
They don't yet know
how to protect themselves.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.680
They have address books at home

58:31.760 --> 58:36.520
that suddenly turn up
as evidence in court.

58:38.120 --> 58:41.400
Denunciations are expressly encouraged.

58:41.480 --> 58:43.880
And the German people deliver.

58:43.960 --> 58:47.120
Neighbors monitor if you get a visitor

58:47.200 --> 58:50.200
and pull the bedroom curtains closed.

58:50.880 --> 58:56.960
Neighbors make statements on
women wearing pants and looking lesbian.

58:57.840 --> 59:02.400
So the police are called upon
to remove these individuals

59:02.480 --> 59:06.440
that one no longer wants to tolerate
within Nazi Germany.

59:13.320 --> 59:17.400
Thus you see between 1933 and 1936,

59:17.480 --> 59:22.800
Manasse tries again and again
to find a place where he can keep living,

59:22.880 --> 59:24.600
a place outside Germany.

59:24.680 --> 59:27.520
And they try to meet up,
whether it be in Berlin

59:27.600 --> 59:30.960
or in cities where Gottfried plays tennis,

59:31.040 --> 59:34.000
in order to be able
to keep seeing each other.

59:34.080 --> 59:38.040
It must have been very, very exhausting
and also very oppressive.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.040
They are young lovers after all.

59:41.160 --> 59:45.920
And that easiness
suddenly changes to this intense,

59:46.000 --> 59:49.080
"How can I get out of here?
How can I get to safety?"

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.440
And there is one last meeting.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.720
And for many years, that is the last night
they can spend with each other.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.360
Gottfried transfers prize money
he won in various tournaments to Manasse,

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:19.680
so that in early 1936 Manasse is able
to emigrate to Palestine and be safe.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.040
He also loses Lisa that same year
because Lisa files for divorce.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:38.400
We know from her later letters
that she often regretted this step,

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.400
but is also convinced

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.960
that she couldn't exist

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.560
alongside this huge love
that Gottfried has for tennis.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.640
She says that if she had continued
to live this life with him,

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.400
she would have had to give up
everything important to her.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.160
Because there was barely room
for her anymore.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:13.480
One of the biggest tennis matches
in Gottfried von Cramm's career

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.880
is the 1937 Davis Cup at Wimbledon

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.440
against his American opponent,
Donald Budge.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.000
At this time, Gottfried is one of
the most popular athletes in the world.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.320
The Nazi regime expects
their tennis player,

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.120
the German player, to win.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.800
There are 15,000 spectators,
Queen Mary herself

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.080
and part of the global public watching.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.360
There had never been
anything quite like it.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.880
And to this day,

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.400
this match is remembered as one of
the greatest games of tennis of all time.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.200
There is an anecdote by Donald Budge

01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:01.520
that Gottfried had a call
shortly before the match,

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.080
supposedly from Hitler,

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.600
threatening him that
if he did not win this game,

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.200
they could no longer protect him.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.120
A match unfolds
where it looks for the most part

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.400
as if Gottfried would be the winner.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.920
At the very end, in the fifth set,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.920
he ends up losing eight to six

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.440
and does what he has
also become famous for,

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.800
he honors the victor.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.440
That delighted the audience.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.800
And everyone understood
that this tennis player,

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:56.160
while he might play for Nazi Germany,
is not identical with Nazi Germany.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.640
Which then poses the question:

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.880
does that still serve the regime?

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.920
After the defeat,
Gottfried goes on a tour of the world

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.520
where he rushes from one tennis tournament
to the next.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.560
At a press conference,

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:25.760
he is asked what he thinks about
the persecution of Jews in Germany.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.800
And he clearly states
that he does not agree with it.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.560
So he makes no bones about his distaste
for National Socialism,

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.120
which means he puts himself
in more and more danger.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.400
ONE PEOPLE, ONE REICH, ONE FÜHRER!

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.200
FREE GERMAN AUSTRIA GREETS YOU!

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.280
ONE PEOPLE, ONE REICH, ONE FÜHRER!

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.960
The Austrians became Nazis overnight.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.920
He had 400,000 people at Heldenplatz

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.760
cheering for him.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:32.120
As Führer and Chancellor
of the German Nations of the Reich,

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.560
I now declare before German history,

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:40.080
the accession of my homeland
to the German Reich!

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.800
Heil! Heil!

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.080
JEWRY IS GANGSTERISM

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.280
When you went out into the street,

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.240
the whole city was full of these posters:
"Jews banned."

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.480
There were posters everywhere you looked.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.240
NON-ARYAN SHOP
HERZMANSKYARYAN AGAIN

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.640
But I still went out into the street.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.400
I really was just wandering the city.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.120
Suddenly I see a crowd of people.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.000
And there's my Aunt Gretel on her knees,

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.960
made to clean the pavement
with a toothbrush.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:37.000
JEW

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:51.560
The day after Hitler came here,
this letter comes in a blue envelope.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.520
"Dear Walter,

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.640
Since you visited me, everything
has become so dreadful in Budapest."

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.840
"You wouldn't recognize it anymore."

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.360
"I also hear dreadful things
out of Vienna."

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.200
"How are you? Are you safe?"

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.720
"My parents have to give up the business,
even though we converted."

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.840
"They're trying
to get us out of the country."

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.840
"But we have no family or close friends."

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.960
"Except you."

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.560
"The Nazis are ever-present everywhere
and I am very scared."

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.640
"Can you help us somehow?"

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.080
"What will you do?"

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.840
"If you go,

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.720
please take me with you
and write to me quickly."

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.760
"Your Lumpi."

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.120
It was a desperate letter.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.920
But I didn't answer the letter because I…

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.400
At the time the letter arrived,

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:59.560
we were already in a very, very precarious
situation in Vienna.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.920
And then, that night,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.280
they came into our apartment
at two in the morning

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.480
and took my father

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.840
and sent him to Dachau.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.760
It was terrible.
How could I have helped him?

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.319
Yes…

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.000
That was the end of Lumpi for me.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.640
Blessed are You, Lord our God,
Ruler of the universe,

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.920
who has sanctified us with His good deeds,

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.479
and commanded us
to light a candle for the Sabbath.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:22.040
During the nights
of the 9th and 10th of November, 1938,

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:26.040
the Pogrom takes place
in the entire Reich.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.760
It was long called
the Night of Broken Glass,

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.319
downplaying its severity.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:38.399
During those nights,
synagogues burn all over Germany.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:41.399
Jewish stores as well as homes

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:46.319
are looted, robbed and destroyed.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:51.120
Many, many Jews are arrested,
and sent to concentration camps.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.240
It's a cold March

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.560
when Gottfried returns
from his six-month world tour.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.160
And on the first evening back,

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.200
he sits down with his mother
and his brothers for supper.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.960
There was a dinner in Brüggen,
where everyone came together.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.200
And then suddenly,
like knock, knock, knock on heaven's door.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.640
Grandma went out
and returned all pale, saying,

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.280
"Gottfried, they're asking for you."

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.800
It was two Gestapo officers,
they immediately took him with them.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.440
And so he was in prison.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.160
The arrest was really theatrically staged.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.080
They could just have written a letter
telling him to come to the police station.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:04.760
But I think the Nazi regime
pretty deliberately chose

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.480
to do this very publicly.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.680
On May 14th, 1938,

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:26.720
Gottfried is sentenced to one year
in prison for violation of Paragraph 175.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.160
The basis for that is his five-year
relationship with Manasse Herbst.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.400
"We had to consider the aggravating factor

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.800
that the accused
engaged in homosexual activity

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.880
so quickly after his wedding."

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.960
"But most egregious was that the accused,

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.280
with his standing in German sports

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.480
with his world-renowned name
and his overall position,

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.920
didn't shy away from engaging

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.160
in homosexual intercourse
with a Galician Jew."

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:07.880
It's lucky that Manasse
had already left Germany at that time.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.040
Or he would not have survived that.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.480
From the beginning,

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.640
concentration camps
were an instrument of Nazi terror.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.000
Prisoners marked as homosexual

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.800
faced particular cruelty

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.200
and rarely experienced solidarity
from other prisoner groups.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.480
BADGES FOR PRISONERS
IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.480
Homosexuals have to wear a pink triangle.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.120
EMIGRANTS, BIBLE SCHOLARS, HOMOSEXUALS

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.720
They are forced to do hard labor under
the harshest, most terrible conditions.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.080
The rations are disastrous,

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.840
so that many, many of the prisoners

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.120
die from the unspeakable conditions
of imprisonment.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.120
Some of them are abused in medical trials,

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.800
not all of them survive.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.320
There's also the option to get castrated

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.560
with the offer or the promise

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.560
that you get to leave
the concentration camp afterwards.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.480
However, we know from various documents

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.480
that a lot of them were not released
despite that.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.440
Many prisoners
who were accused of homosexuality,

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.000
often based on denunciations,

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.680
don't survive imprisonment in the camps.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.920
Their prosecution
reaches its peak between 1937 and 1939,

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:17.000
immediately before Hitler
starts his war against Europe.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.200
In 1941, Hitler puts Heinrich Himmler
in charge

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.320
of the so-called
"final solution of the Jewish question."

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.320
That means Heinrich Himmler is tasked

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.000
with the order to exterminate
German and European Jews.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.560
I searched for Lumpi all my life.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.560
I wanted to know where he was,
what had happened to him.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.560
Only now have I seen this pictures.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.920
And only now has it all come out.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.200
He was in a labor camp
and starved to death.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.720
It was terrible to me
that he died like that.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.280
Not only… The only thing you can say
is that he didn't deserve that.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.560
MARTYRS OF WAR

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.920
Terrible.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.200
And what do I see?

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:10.400
This, this large stone, the photograph
of this large stone that says,

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.280
"Fülöp Loránt", 24 years old or maybe 25.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:21.360
FÜLÖP LÓRÁNT
25 YEARS

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.520
In Vienna you say
that there's a lot to verkiefeln.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.440
It's something you can never accept
if you can't verkiefeln something.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:44.920
Yeah.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:54.080
I'm glad that if Lumpi
is remembered by history,

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.400
I did my very small part in that.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:11.520
Not knowing what happened to a loved one

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.680
is unfortunately very common
for many Jewish victims.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.640
For many of them we learn only much later
or sometimes never at all

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.080
where they were murdered.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:40.000
Homosexual survivors want to,
but can't share their stories.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.080
It's too dangerous.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.680
After 1945,

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.520
the state-sponsored
persecution of homosexuals

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.640
is not recognized as an injustice.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.280
West Germany
adopts the Nazi Paragraph 175.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.280
Society considers homosexuals
to be criminals and perverts.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:03.760
Families remain silent,
historians don't ask questions.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.640
The persecution continues.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.600
CRIMINAL CASE
AGAINST GOTTFRIED VON CRAMM

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:19.680
In 1951, Gottfried tries, incidentally
like many other homosexuals as well,

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.480
to have the conviction
according to Paragraph 175

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.920
deleted from his record.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.320
Without an expungement,

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.680
he can't receive a visa to be able

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.960
to participate in tennis tournaments
in the US, Great Britain or France.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.720
There is a trial

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.440
for which Manasse Herbst
also returns to Germany

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.480
for the first time in 1951.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.440
That means he returns to the country
that had wanted to kill him.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.560
And it is the first reunion
between Gottfried and Manasse.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.960
Lisa is also questioned.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:10.480
She confirms the relationship
between Manasse and Gottfried.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.400
For one moment, they fearlessly rebuild

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:17.600
on the freedom
that they lived in the late 20s.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.600
And all that in the extremely conservative
50s in a German court.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.320
DECLINED AN EARLY EXPUNGEMENT

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.640
Like for other convicted homosexuals,

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.080
Gottfried's expungement is denied.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.800
He can't get a visa
for the most important tennis tournaments.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.880
He does win other tournaments
in countries where he's admitted,

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.720
but the really important ones
he can't play in,

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:49.240
exactly because he has a previous criminal
conviction under Nazi Paragraph 175.

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:05.160
I emigrated to the US

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:10.160
and have lived here since 1939, happily.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:15.640
I became a composer
and have spent my whole life composing.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.240
ELDORADO
HERE IT IS RIGHT!

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.680
PANTRY AT THE ELDORADO

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.480
I think the queer life in Berlin

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.560
had to completely reinvent itself.

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:04.000
And that has worked out pretty well

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.520
when you look at how queer life in Berlin
is really thriving

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:12.040
and how multifaceted and diverse
it has become.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.480
But drawing on something?

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.480
I don't think we could draw on anything.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:20.520
For a long time,

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.320
we didn't even know anything
about the persecution of homosexuals.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.400
And in that sense, today's queer Berlin…

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.760
certainly isn't a…

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:37.120
a continuation in any shape or form
of the 1920s.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.560
That really was lost.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.120
No names. No memory. Nothing.
