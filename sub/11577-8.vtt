00:06.090 --> 00:07.250
[BO narrating]
Previously on Lost Girl:

00:07.466 --> 00:08.922
[LAUREN] Somebody's trying
to send us a message.

00:09.135 --> 00:10.545
The Ancients are behind this.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.012
[BO] My dad is Hades.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.552
He's trying to
use me for something.

00:13.764 --> 00:14.514
[IRIS] What can you do?

00:14.724 --> 00:16.089
[MARK] I'm a shifter.

00:16.309 --> 00:17.424
I serve my keepers.

00:17.643 --> 00:18.974
Your keepers?

00:19.187 --> 00:20.302
I mean, my parents.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.182
[TAMSIN] I know where
your heart truly lies.

00:22.398 --> 00:24.138
It's with me.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.973
--[BO] Tamsin.
--[TAMS|N] Don't!

00:27.445 --> 00:28.776
[BO] Zeus' lightning.
Takes the power of

00:28.988 --> 00:30.148
an Ancient
to kill an Ancient.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.525
Please, let me go.

00:32.742 --> 00:33.902
[CASSIE screams]

00:34.118 --> 00:36.359
It's time for us to meet
the other side of the family.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.040
[BO] You are part
of this team, Tamsin.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.534
You can't just walk away.

00:41.751 --> 00:43.537
We need you. I need you.

00:43.753 --> 00:46.085
[TAMSIN grunts] You know what?

00:46.297 --> 00:49.835
That's really nice of you.
But we both know it's not true.

00:50.051 --> 00:50.961
And I don't need you either.

00:51.177 --> 00:52.337
Tamsin.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.760
[TAMSIN] Oh.
These leather pants yours?

00:54.972 --> 00:57.054
Doesn't matter.
You keep 'em.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.302
I know you like
to reuse old styles.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.349
Fashion snark, huh?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.268
Is that where we're at now?

01:03.481 --> 01:05.472
Come on, Tamsin.
We can talk about this.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.556
You know what?
We don't need to.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.017
l was upset and now I'm not.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.602
I realize there's
no winning with you.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.027
What game were we playing again?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.446
Uh, doesn't matter
where your body is,

01:13.658 --> 01:15.239
your heart'll
always be with her.

01:15.451 --> 01:16.987
Have you been listening
to John Legend?

01:17.203 --> 01:18.613
[TAMSIN]
You and Lauren...

01:18.829 --> 01:21.320
You two, you'll
just always be a couple.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.326
Even when you're not.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.043
Damn it!

01:26.837 --> 01:28.043
Where will you go?

01:28.256 --> 01:30.668
Wherever the universe takes me.

01:30.883 --> 01:31.838
[clears throat]

01:32.051 --> 01:36.090
Motel Six. And then
wherever the universe takes me.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.466
Oh, I forgot.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.469
[TAMSIN] This came for you.

01:41.978 --> 01:43.639
[BO] Tamsin.

01:43.854 --> 01:48.188
I lost Kenzi. I don't
wanna lose you too.

01:48.401 --> 01:50.357
It's better this way.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.496
[BO] No way.

02:15.011 --> 02:16.717
It's always nice to be popular.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.215
Yeah, well, speak for yourself.

02:19.432 --> 02:20.797
I didn't get an invite, did I?

02:21.017 --> 02:22.302
Count yourself lucky.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.304
The question is, why now?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.977
Human sacrifices.
Murdering a football player.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.725
Mutilating the oracles.
A storm that almost

02:28.941 --> 02:30.147
wiped out the colony.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.769
They need a palette cleanser?

02:31.986 --> 02:32.816
[chuckles]

02:33.029 --> 02:34.769
These supposed Ancients
are related to my father.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.775
He's behind all
of this, I know it.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.947
In your oracle vision
you saw him, didn't you?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.149
[TRICK] What did he say?

02:40.369 --> 02:42.200
A bunch of riddles.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.779
Greatest evil is
the greatest mercy.

02:44.999 --> 02:45.988
If we want to get
to the bottom of this,

02:46.208 --> 02:48.073
we're gonna have
to go to the source.

02:49.128 --> 02:52.291
And we're gonna have
to get you a new suit.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.168
What do you say? You up
for your first mission?

02:55.384 --> 02:56.999
[MARK] Yeah, yeah.
Wh-What's the plan?

02:57.219 --> 03:00.302
Mythology states even the
Ancients have an Achilles heel.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.130
So we find out what it is
and we take them down.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.761
[BO] Let's go.

03:07.563 --> 03:08.598
Hey, hey, hey.

03:08.814 --> 03:12.306
Are you sure he's ready?
The kid hasn't even shifted yet.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.517
[DYSON] He's gotta
become a man sometime.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.073
First mission, huh?

03:21.285 --> 03:23.776
Are you gonna get yourself
your very own vest?

03:23.996 --> 03:25.532
Oh, please. God no.

03:25.748 --> 03:27.409
[BOTH chuckle]

03:27.625 --> 03:32.085
Yeah, well... Give me a call
if you need backup, all right?

03:32.296 --> 03:33.536
I'll call you if I get bored.

03:33.756 --> 03:35.212
[chuckles]

03:37.051 --> 03:41.044
[elevator music plays]

03:41.263 --> 03:42.878
Hope they
have an open bar.

03:43.099 --> 03:45.135
Except you won't
be drinking.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.216
No alcohol. Right.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.141
And?

03:48.354 --> 03:50.640
Keep your back to
the wall. Know your exits.

03:50.856 --> 03:51.936
And trust your gut.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.140
If you feel something's off,
listen to it.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.145
If the plan changes--

03:55.361 --> 03:56.976
Roll with it.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.026
I got it.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.604
You know, I hate to be a
buzzkill, but are we gonna

03:59.824 --> 04:04.568
talk about the possibility
that this could be a trap?

04:04.787 --> 04:05.867
No?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.490
[elevator dings]

04:18.134 --> 04:18.998
[LAUREN whispering] Now
are we going to talk about

04:19.218 --> 04:21.630
the possibility that
this could be a trap?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.507
[GUESTS] Surprise!

04:24.723 --> 04:34.724
[clapping and cheering]

04:37.194 --> 04:38.934
Okay.

04:39.155 --> 04:40.645
I need a drink.

04:42.867 --> 04:47.861
[opening theme]

04:49.415 --> 04:51.497
Does this bracelet
go with this outfit?

04:51.709 --> 04:55.122
Don't be silly. It's a one of a
kind. It goes with everything.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.123
[HERA] Did you exfoliate?

05:00.342 --> 05:03.084
| used the dead sea scrub,
just like you asked me to.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.590
Good girl.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.765
[HERA] You know how Zee
likes to show you off.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.933
Mm-mmm.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.306
Wouldn't want to upset her.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.934
Because she'll yell at you.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.606
You know what? Maybe you're
not ready for this party.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.479
[HERA] Maybe you should
stay in here tonight.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.150
[IRIS] No.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.112
Lie down for a while.

05:21.322 --> 05:24.064
No! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

05:24.283 --> 05:28.071
I really wanna go
to the party. Please.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.454
Aw, bunny.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.202
Okay.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.158
[HERA] Come along, my pet.

05:37.796 --> 05:38.421
[HERA] Well?

05:38.631 --> 05:41.464
The guests.
I should go greet them.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.921
[HERA] Can't wait till everyone
sees how special you are.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.096
Mmm.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.971
[HERA] Oh, and get the
guests to try the clam dip.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.350
Zee tried a new recipe and...

05:56.565 --> 05:58.021
it's been a whole thing.

06:05.324 --> 06:06.655
Thank you.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.573
[LAUREN]
Uh, hold it right there.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.196
Just”.

06:15.584 --> 06:18.542
Okay. All clear.

06:18.754 --> 06:19.504
Drink up.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.999
Forgot how much
fun you are at parties.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.376
[MAN] Great party, Bo.
Great party.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.423
Yes. Thank you. That's right.
The party's for me.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.376
Yeah. And nobody
seems to know why.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.929
This party reeks
of my father.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.551
Do you think it's possible
whatever brought in

06:32.768 --> 06:34.554
the Ancients brought
Hades with them?

06:34.770 --> 06:36.101
The Greek Gods are
throwing me a surprise party.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.690
I'd say that
anything is possible.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.570
Preliminary sweep of
the penthouse complete.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.440
No sign of the Ancients.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.897
And the clam dip is amazing.

06:48.117 --> 06:50.278
Uh, there seems to be
a fair number of Fae here.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.449
Yeah, well I don't like it.

06:51.662 --> 06:52.868
Whatever they're
planning is big.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.490
Yeah, and they
want an audience.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.368
Well, then we'll
give them a show.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.792
Well, I'm on Hera duty. Soon as
I see his smug little face--

07:00.004 --> 07:02.416
|--| can't weaken his
power, but in an effort

07:02.631 --> 07:04.007
to avoid another bug shower,

07:04.216 --> 07:08.175
D-Phenothrin, Prallethrin,
Deltamethrin.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.252
It's bug spray, essentially.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.554
Wait. Can't you just turn them
human like you did the Morrigan?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.051
That process took months.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.133
Isolating each
unique Fae chromosome

07:16.353 --> 07:16.808
and then inversing of the--

07:17.021 --> 07:19.262
Okay, okay. Just--give me
the syringe. Thank you.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.766
And I'll keep an
eye on the crowd.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.816
In case there's
any unusual activity.

07:24.028 --> 07:26.360
I'll be by the clam dip.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.062
What about me?

07:28.282 --> 07:29.488
Iris. You know her best.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.736
[DYSON] See if you can find
out something about her parents.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.989
I'm glad you changed your
mind about wanting to help.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.036
United force, right?

07:37.249 --> 07:38.580
Just show me you
can take it seriously.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.202
Oh, you know it.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.457
[LAUREN] I'm on samples.
Blood, sweat, saliva.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.753
Anything I can break down.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.343
[BO] Okay, while you do that,
I'll greet the hostess.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.463
If I can find her.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.135
[BO] Uh, Lauren wait.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.345
About what happened
between us, during the blackout.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.643
Let me save you the trouble.
We slept together.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.972
It was a one-time thing.
I get it. I'm okay with it.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.774
Okay. But here's the thing.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.227
I'm not.

08:08.447 --> 08:12.611
[BO] I mean, I was...
but it--it's just...

08:12.826 --> 08:16.444
Ther's always gonna be a reason
for us not to be together.

08:16.664 --> 08:20.077
[BO] And I don't want
to put this off any longer.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.828
Oh boy.

08:22.044 --> 08:26.208
"Oh boy" yes or "oh boy" no?

08:32.930 --> 08:34.921
And we're back.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.223
Although, it is
a very nice back.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.596
We'll finish this later, okay?

08:40.813 --> 08:42.303
[LAUREN] Okay.

08:43.315 --> 08:47.274
[party commotion]

08:47.486 --> 08:49.772
I didn't realize
you got an invitation.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.730
[TAMSIN sighs]

08:52.950 --> 08:54.906
It's nice to see you too.

08:55.119 --> 08:56.905
I'm glad you're here.

08:57.121 --> 08:58.076
We need you.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.448
[TAMSIN] Yeah,
Dyson filled me in on

08:59.665 --> 09:01.747
operation Ancients go history.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.665
I'm game.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.584
Well maybe you
should take it easy.

09:06.797 --> 09:10.335
Look, I'll play superhero
with you tonight.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.634
But there's no way I'm not
having fun while I do it.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.316
[music box plays]

09:33.532 --> 09:35.488
You look beautiful
in that dress.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.319
[IRIS] It's okay. I don't
mind you in my room.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.995
I mean, it's nice
to have company.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.243
Hera never lets
me have friends over.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.667
Well...

09:46.879 --> 09:49.791
I hate to break
it to you, Iris, but...

09:50.007 --> 09:54.046
you and I, we aren't
exactly friends.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.674
Your hair's so shiny.
Can I touch it?

09:58.974 --> 10:00.589
That's a pretty bracelet.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.765
My parents make me wear it.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.094
Your parents?

10:05.314 --> 10:08.647
Speaking of which,

10:08.859 --> 10:11.066
[BO] why don't you
tell me where they are?

10:11.278 --> 10:15.396
The blonde one.
What do you call her?

10:15.616 --> 10:17.447
Depends on who you ask.

10:24.041 --> 10:32.836
[party commotion and music]

10:33.050 --> 10:35.917
Excuse me.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.001
[clears throat]

10:39.807 --> 10:42.173
[HERA] I'm happy you came.

10:42.392 --> 10:46.055
I thought after our last
interaction you might be...

10:46.271 --> 10:47.932
bugged by me.

10:48.148 --> 10:52.061
I thought you might think that.
So, I brought you a little gift.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.687
[HERA groans]

10:55.989 --> 10:57.069
What the hell's in that?

10:57.282 --> 10:58.863
Oh, a little
precautionary measure.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.112
What can I say?
Every dog has his day.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.195
Then again, some dogs
just need to be neutered.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.826
Hm.

11:07.042 --> 11:12.002
Which reminds me. How is
my bitch Alicia doing?

11:12.214 --> 11:13.829
She wanted me to give you this.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.550
[GUESTS gasp]

11:19.596 --> 11:21.973
Is that all you got?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.343
I guess I'm not
match for a "god."

11:30.148 --> 11:33.640
[ZEE] In Egypt I was Amun,
Oden to the Vikings,

11:33.861 --> 11:35.442
Jupiter to the Romans.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.736
But you'd know
me best as Zeus.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.779
Zeus?

11:39.992 --> 11:44.952
As in white hair, thunder
thighs, plus... a dude?

11:45.163 --> 11:47.415
Just like a patriarchal
society to depict

11:47.624 --> 11:50.582
its most powerful
member as male.

11:52.713 --> 11:58.458
I've had many forms,
but currently Zee is a she.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.794
And my aunt. Huh.

12:03.348 --> 12:07.136
Question is...
what kind are you?

12:07.352 --> 12:08.512
The cool aunt who
buys you condoms

12:08.729 --> 12:11.015
or the crazy aunt
who ruins Christmas?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.313
Oh, wait. I know.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.062
You're the kind that
murders innocent people.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.769
When you're trying to make
your way in a new world,

12:18.989 --> 12:20.775

12:20.991 --> 12:23.778
Hm. Whatever helps
you sleep at night.

My hands are clean.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.662
Mostly.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.626
Which brings us back to Daddy.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.625
Hades may have
inspired this shindig,

12:37.841 --> 12:41.959
but let's get
one thing straight.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.216
You and I are on the same team.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.048
You're on a sinking ship.
The balance is quickly shifting

12:48.268 --> 12:50.133
and I don't wanna
see you go down.

12:50.354 --> 12:53.016
I happen to be quite buoyant.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.018
Deflect with humor.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.735
Why did you send
the oracles after me?

12:57.945 --> 13:02.439
To find your truth. The thing
that you crave above all.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.364
Your untimely demise?

13:04.576 --> 13:06.112
[ZEE] Come on, Bo.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.820
We both know what
your heart truly desires.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.907
It's freedom from your father.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.957
[ZEE] I'm here to grant it.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.580
How?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.458
Why would you do that?

13:19.675 --> 13:23.008
Because, I told you. I want
the same thing as you, Bo.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.801
But we have to stop him first.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.095
Stop him from what?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.764
From using you to end the world.

13:37.818 --> 13:38.898
[BO] We're leaving.
Where are the others?

13:39.111 --> 13:40.271
Bo. What's going on?

13:40.487 --> 13:40.987
[TRICK] Did you--

13:41.196 --> 13:44.780
My aunt Zeus wants to
emancipate me from Hades.

13:44.992 --> 13:45.902
[BO] Yeah, I know.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.109
The one thing that I want.
To dangle it in front of me,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.159
after everything that
she has done. The nerve.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.283
But wait. Why?

13:52.499 --> 13:55.115
To stop the zombie apocalypse
or whatever dramatic end of days

13:55.335 --> 13:57.075
daddy dearest
has in store for us.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.671
Where are Dyson and Lauren?

13:58.880 --> 13:59.710
Maybe we should consider--

13:59.923 --> 14:01.914
[BO] Never mind.
I'll find them myself.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.918
Glad you could make it, Trick.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.131
The Aegis shield.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.224
Mythology says you were
never without its protection.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.147
No glove, no love.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.602

You've gotta see this.

The original original.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.659
I never forget a drink.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.333
What is it?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.251
In ancient times it
was custom to drink

14:40.464 --> 14:43.797
the Coquetel
to reveal the future.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.466
It's the only way you can
see for yourself the pain

14:46.678 --> 14:49.215
Hades will cause if
you stay bound to him.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.637
Cassie was our friend.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.555
Do you actually think
we're gonna drink this?

14:52.768 --> 14:54.599
I don't have time
to braid your hair.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.928
The longer you're connected,
the stronger he becomes.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.561
All those lives. Everything.

15:43.777 --> 15:44.562
Gone.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.769
Oh god. I need to sit down.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.604
I've never felt so much nothing.

15:49.825 --> 15:51.781
Complete and utter nothing.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.611
I have. In Tartarus.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.914
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.702
How do we stop him?

16:02.921 --> 16:04.286
Hades has been banished
to the underworld

16:04.506 --> 16:05.666
for thousands of years.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.998
That little "property of" stamp,

16:08.218 --> 16:09.754
[ZEE] that's his ticket
to the ground level.

16:09.970 --> 16:13.383
It gives him his power.
It's like an... umbilical cord.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.338
So I've been feeding him?

16:15.559 --> 16:17.720
An all-you-can-eat buffet.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.723
Okay. Let's say I agree
to this emancipation.

16:20.939 --> 16:21.803
How does it work?

16:22.023 --> 16:24.890
Some anointing, some chanting.

16:25.110 --> 16:29.353
Let me guess. A sacrifice?

hemming and hawing.

I'm a real riot. Just saying.

Hey. What's wrong?

You die.

for the extraction.

Pick your poison
for the extraction.

Choose correctly
or the ritual will fail.

24:37.518 --> 24:40.726
Especially now that the scar
has healed from your bolt.

24:40.938 --> 24:44.772
Impressive. You heal
faster than most.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.394
Not even a blemish.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.727
Must be good genes.

24:48.946 --> 24:52.564
You'll have to forgive me.
I overreacted that day.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.651
Couldn't have you
interfering with Clay's game.

24:55.870 --> 24:59.704
Right. Fueling up
to face Big Brother?

24:59.916 --> 25:02.407
Suddenly makes me
grateful I'm an only child.

25:06.881 --> 25:09.714
And there he is now.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.300
Are we really gonna
let this happen?

25:17.517 --> 25:19.098
Let her cut our girl?

25:19.310 --> 25:21.722
The fate of the
colony depends on it.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.145
I saw it too, Dyson.

25:28.069 --> 25:30.526
The moment of truth.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.444
[DYSON clears throat]

25:32.657 --> 25:36.570
What? I love this shit.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.152
[LAUREN] Bo, stop.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.159
Iris is more powerful than
both of the Ancients combined.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.661
Mark is alone with her?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.913
Mark! Mark, get out here!

25:47.130 --> 25:48.745
Dyson, I already looked for him.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.501
They're gone. Both of them.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.378
Come on. What is the big deal?

25:52.593 --> 25:55.175
The most powerful of you is
with the least powerful of us.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.673
We need to find them. Now.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.845
You can't leave.
I'm not finished.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.845
Well there's a first
time for everything.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.219
Fine.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.435
Plan B.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.060
Imagine we lived
here all the time.

26:13.281 --> 26:17.741
Yeah. No boxing gym smell.

26:17.952 --> 26:18.941
No murder board.

26:19.162 --> 26:22.871
No Dyson lecturing me
about responsibilities.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.368
No Zee and Hera
telling me what to do.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.325
Telling me what to eat.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.458
What do you wanna do now?

26:31.674 --> 26:36.088
I mean, a nice house like this has
gotta have some snacks, right?

26:43.519 --> 26:46.431
[IRIS] Hey. If you
find chips, I call dibs.

27:00.369 --> 27:03.236
Didn't she live a happy life?

27:03.456 --> 27:05.071
This is where Cee Cee grew up.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.452
[IRIS] She banged her
chin right on that corner there

27:07.668 --> 27:10.876
and she had to get stitches.
See? Right here.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.420
This is your vessel's house?

27:13.633 --> 27:14.588
Why did you bring me here?

27:14.801 --> 27:16.792
Sometimes,
I still talk to her

27:17.011 --> 27:19.093
and she thinks
you're really cute.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.715
She's still alive inside of you?

27:20.932 --> 27:22.047
But don't tell Zee and Hera.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.927
I was supposed to kill mine.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.555
Please, let's just--
let's go home.

27:26.771 --> 27:29.308
Why? This could be my home.

27:29.524 --> 27:30.559
This could be my new family.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.185
Look, you took over
her body, all right.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.858
But that doesn't make you her.
This isn't your family.

27:35.071 --> 27:35.821
All right, we need to go now.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.986
No. When they meet me,
they'll love me

27:38.199 --> 27:39.985
just as much as
they loved Cee Cee.

27:40.201 --> 27:41.691
[IRIS] She misses them.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.993
I hear her crying.

27:44.205 --> 27:45.945
[door opens]

27:46.165 --> 27:49.157
Oh, shit. They're home.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.959
We need to go. We need to go.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.387
Daddy?

28:04.809 --> 28:06.219
It can't be.

28:06.435 --> 28:10.019
It's me. I'm home.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.017
It's really you?

28:13.526 --> 28:15.482
Nancy!

28:18.823 --> 28:20.688
Cecilia.

28:33.129 --> 28:34.744
No.

28:36.799 --> 28:39.211
You're not my daughter.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.383
I know my daughter.

28:44.682 --> 28:46.843
You're not my daughter.

28:47.059 --> 28:51.223
Why don't you love me?
Does your heart not work?

28:51.439 --> 28:55.478
[groaning]

29:08.122 --> 29:09.532
What did you do?

29:14.670 --> 29:17.047
It was you who killed
all those people.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.247
They had to
go to sleep, Mark.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.892
There's no use.
I can't do anything.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.763
Mark, it's okay. Someday
they're all gonna wake up

29:31.979 --> 29:32.934
a-and they'll be better.

29:33.147 --> 29:34.353
No they won't, Iris.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.066
Iris, you--you killed them.

29:36.275 --> 29:36.980
Hera said that--

29:37.193 --> 29:40.105
Hera is evil! All right.
How do you not get that by now?!

29:40.321 --> 29:40.980
They used you!

29:41.197 --> 29:46.191
No. No. Stop! No, no!
No, this is what--

29:46.410 --> 29:47.490
this is what I'm
supposed to do, Mark!

29:47.703 --> 29:50.285
They said--they said
it's all gonna end.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.489
[IRIS] They're gonna wake up.
This is what that means, Mark.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.244
Everything that ends
is gonna start again.

29:54.460 --> 29:58.624
Iris, just calm down,
all right. Let me think.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.966
I didn't mean to hurt them.

30:01.175 --> 30:03.257
You didn't know what you
were doing. They used you.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.628
Not anymore.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.884
I won't let them.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.723
Mark.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.977
Something's happening.

30:20.152 --> 30:24.270
Mark, you have to help me.
Something's happening.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.481
Mark.

30:26.701 --> 30:27.986
[MARK] Iris. Iris, look.

30:28.202 --> 30:29.703
Look, you need to get
out of here, all right. Go!

30:29.912 --> 30:31.903
Go! I'll take
care of it. Go!

30:34.667 --> 30:36.532
[MARK] Oh my god.

30:40.256 --> 30:50.302
[WOMAN sobbing]

30:50.516 --> 30:52.177
[ZEE] She knows better
than to remove it.

30:52.393 --> 30:54.725
Even Iris isn't that stupid.

30:56.439 --> 30:57.929
[HERA] Well speaking of stupid.

30:58.149 --> 30:59.309
Oh, you're one to talk.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.686
Who let the cat out of
the bag in the first place?

31:01.902 --> 31:03.688
Can you do
anything without me?

31:03.904 --> 31:04.859
I don't think that that--

31:05.072 --> 31:05.982
[ZEE] Shut it.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.779
Once the super friends
bring Mark and Iris back,

31:07.992 --> 31:10.529
we'll get this
show on the road.

31:10.745 --> 31:12.451
Go.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.576
[TAMSIN] Show?

31:16.792 --> 31:20.956
So... they've left you
here to keep an eye on us.

31:21.172 --> 31:23.754
Yeah. Lucky me.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.672
Report this back
to your friends:

31:25.885 --> 31:28.422
Bo's emancipation
is now or never.

31:28.637 --> 31:29.422
You aren't the
least bit worried

31:29.638 --> 31:30.718
your daughter's missing?

31:30.931 --> 31:32.717
[ZEE] Please. They're
fine. They're kids.

31:32.933 --> 31:36.061
Meanwhile, Hades is
about to wipe us all out.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.556
We need Bo to
complete the ceremony.

31:38.773 --> 31:39.762
Well, good luck with that.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.438
[ZEE] What do you mean?

31:41.650 --> 31:45.188
No, I think Bo should
separate from her father.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.314
But I think Bo
should make different

31:46.530 --> 31:49.021
relationship choices in general.

31:51.994 --> 31:56.658
Sounds like she's made bad
choices about a lot of things.

31:56.874 --> 31:59.866
Care to share?

32:00.086 --> 32:02.247
No.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.454
You know, I'm actually
kind of relieved.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.413
No more waiting for
the other shoe to drop.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.841
[chuckles]

32:09.053 --> 32:11.669
I'm not really a
relationship kind of person.

32:11.889 --> 32:15.802
Y'know, it's not in me.
Kinda like a free bird.

32:20.981 --> 32:26.601
I've never seen a Valkyrie cry.

32:26.821 --> 32:29.733
It's 'cause it's against type.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.860
No emotions on the battlefield.

32:32.076 --> 32:33.737
Yes, ma'am. No ma'am.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.820
Doubt. Kill. Repeat.

32:40.167 --> 32:43.159
You'd think by my last life
I'd have this figured out.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.174
Word of advice.

32:55.057 --> 33:00.393
Sometimes it can take
centuries to figure it out.

33:00.604 --> 33:03.266
When did people
stop hurting you?

33:07.528 --> 33:10.065
They didn't.

33:10.281 --> 33:16.117
I started hurting them.
And you're next.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.159
I doubt that.

33:22.293 --> 33:24.659
Cassie tried to be brave, too.

33:24.879 --> 33:29.418
Poor girl. Terrible
eyesight that one.

33:29.633 --> 33:32.875
You know, the difference between
Cassie and me is I can fly.

33:33.095 --> 33:34.505
[ZEE] Hm.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.638
hhundeﬂ

33:37.850 --> 33:40.512
[TAMSIN moans]

33:41.604 --> 33:43.560
Not anymore.

33:50.946 --> 33:51.935
[LAUREN] | just talked
to Trick at The Dal.

33:52.156 --> 33:53.145
There's no sign
of them there.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.354
[BO] Is this the place?

33:54.575 --> 33:55.485
[DYSON] Precinct said
there was a disturbance

33:55.701 --> 33:56.907
at the south
end of the park.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.984
A girl matching
Iris' description.

33:59.205 --> 33:59.990
Police are on their way.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.662
[BO] Well then, let's get
to her before they do.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.284
[car doors shut]

34:04.793 --> 34:05.657
[sniffs]

34:05.878 --> 34:07.209
This is Mark's.

34:07.421 --> 34:10.379
That is way more
blood than I like.

34:10.591 --> 34:11.501
He went that way.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.627
That's west.

34:12.843 --> 34:15.755
Go. I'll go south; get Iris.

34:15.971 --> 34:16.835
Bo, wait.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.011
What?

34:18.224 --> 34:20.215
"Oh boy" yes.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.932
Okay, Iris.

34:30.152 --> 34:33.315
Time to find out what
makes you so powerful.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.249
Do you need help, miss?

34:51.465 --> 34:53.456
Please, sir. Just go away.

34:53.676 --> 34:55.462
Here. Just give me your hand.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.938
[BO] Iris?

35:10.150 --> 35:13.358
lt's Bo. Is everything okay?

35:13.570 --> 35:17.154
Please don't
get too close to me.

35:17.366 --> 35:20.733
I just wanna make
sure that you're okay.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.534
You and Mark.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.077
Mark's mad at me.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.655
Stay away. Don't touch me.

35:25.874 --> 35:30.038
Okay. Okay. Let's
just talk. Girl to girl.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.495
I won't touch you.

35:32.715 --> 35:34.455
Why is Mark mad at you?

35:34.675 --> 35:37.132
I'm not supposed
to make you sleep.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.754
Zee needs you.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.758
"Sleep"?

35:41.974 --> 35:44.590
Well, lucky for you,
I'm a Succubus.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.926
I don't need much sleep.

35:47.146 --> 35:50.479
Mark's right. All
I do is hurt people.

35:50.691 --> 35:57.608
Hey. When I was
younger, I hurt people.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.984
I didn't mean to.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.113
But I didn't know what I was.
I didn't know what I was doing.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.163
They make me do bad things.

36:07.374 --> 36:09.285
I'm a murderer.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.992
What do they make you do?

36:14.089 --> 36:18.583
[BO] Iris, please.
Where is Mark?

36:18.802 --> 36:21.134
I told you not to touch me.

36:22.264 --> 36:23.800
What the hell?

36:33.275 --> 36:35.732
The darkness wasn't my father.

36:40.741 --> 36:42.447
It was Iris.

36:50.084 --> 36:51.290
[TRICK] My god, Bo. Your hand.

36:51.502 --> 36:53.538
The vision came true. It's Iris.

36:53.754 --> 36:55.290
There's something
else inside her.

36:55.506 --> 36:58.213
She's turning
everything to nothing.

36:58.425 --> 36:59.835
Wait.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.636
Here.

37:08.852 --> 37:13.471
[TRICK] The Nyx. A primordial
force of evil. Born from chaos.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.067
The chaos of the
colony after the storm.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.311
They were waiting
for the perfect time to

37:17.528 --> 37:19.940
release it in Iris.
Wipe us out.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.237
Ticking time bomb
wrapped in a rainbow.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.781
How do we fight it?

37:34.378 --> 37:37.370
I'm not sure that we can.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.204
[TRICK] Unless...

37:43.220 --> 37:47.054
[TRICK] There was a story
that my mother told me.

37:49.852 --> 37:52.719
[TRICK] A toy box
that can contain evil.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.519
The original jack-in-the-box.

37:54.731 --> 37:58.098
Only a box made of adamantine,
the ore of Ancients,

37:58.318 --> 38:00.479
could contain such evil.

38:00.696 --> 38:02.436
Unless the box is a metaphor.

38:02.656 --> 38:04.988
No. It's real.

38:05.200 --> 38:09.910
And I have it. A gift
from the underworld.

38:10.122 --> 38:11.908
A gift. From who?

38:12.124 --> 38:13.534
From my father.

38:13.750 --> 38:14.614
Well, where is it now?

38:14.835 --> 38:16.666
It's at the clubhouse.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.127
Why can't I find him,
Lauren? I can't focus.

38:23.343 --> 38:24.549
Dyson, it's because
he's your son.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.092
Your feelings are
getting in the way.

38:26.305 --> 38:27.920
Look, you need to stop.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.846
Take a deep breath.
Close your eyes.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.219
Picture Mark's face.

38:51.622 --> 38:53.032
There.

38:59.755 --> 39:04.044
[MARK gasping]

39:04.259 --> 39:05.169
[LAUREN]
What are you doing here?

39:05.385 --> 39:07.592
[VEX panting] He called.

39:07.804 --> 39:08.793
He's gonna be okay, right?

39:09.014 --> 39:12.051
Dyson, I need you to help
me put pressure on the wound.

39:12.267 --> 39:15.555
Dyson, please. To stanch
the bleeding, please!

39:15.771 --> 39:18.854
I'm... I'm gonna try
and get some help.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.272
Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

39:20.484 --> 39:21.894
[DYSON] Hey. Hey.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.271
Mark. Mark.
Hey. Stay with me.

39:24.488 --> 39:25.898
Stay with me, Mark.
I'm right here.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.103
[DYSON]
You're gonna be okay.

39:27.324 --> 39:30.031
--[DYSON] Hey. Hey.
--[MARK labored breathing]

39:30.244 --> 39:33.782
You're gonna be okay.
Lauren's gonna take care of you.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.157
Right?

39:35.374 --> 39:39.162
[MARK labored breathing]

39:45.842 --> 39:48.174
Oh, don't mind me.
I'm just leaving.

39:48.387 --> 39:50.343
Over my dead hand.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.842
That's why you really
sent the oracles after me.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.302
You were after my box.

39:58.522 --> 40:00.262
I'm not leaving without it.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.266
[BOTH grunt]

40:13.078 --> 40:14.488
--[BO grunts]
--[ZEE yelps]

40:19.710 --> 40:21.120
[BOTH grunt]

40:26.174 --> 40:27.584
[ZEE gasps]

40:32.848 --> 40:34.088
[BO] Augh!

40:34.308 --> 40:37.175
Fashion and function.

40:37.394 --> 40:42.058
Black is the new--get the
hell outta my house.

40:44.943 --> 40:52.486
[panting]

40:52.701 --> 40:53.451
[knocking on door]

40:53.660 --> 40:57.118
[ZEE] Bo. You don't
wanna open that box.

40:57.331 --> 41:00.494
Yeah? Give me one
good reason why?

41:00.709 --> 41:03.746
You open that box and
your father will walk the Earth.

41:15.182 --> 41:16.888
[ZEE] Come on, Bo.
You have a choice right now.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.352
You could start over.
You could free yourself

41:19.561 --> 41:20.971
from Hades once and for all.

41:21.188 --> 41:25.727
Reclaim what's yours. I could've
killed you, but I let you live.

41:25.942 --> 41:31.278
The oracles deliver truth
to extract the truth.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.239
[MAN'S VOICE] Don't be afraid.

41:36.453 --> 41:37.989
Dad?

41:38.205 --> 41:42.198
There's barely any time.
We must be quick.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.453
Leave me alone.

41:44.670 --> 41:47.787
There are those far more
wicked than I upon this Earth.

41:48.006 --> 41:51.794
You must stop them.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.251
Who? The Ancients?

41:54.471 --> 41:57.634
Only family can destroy them.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.340
So, what? I need you?

42:00.560 --> 42:06.521
Our power will decide
the fate of this world.

42:06.733 --> 42:10.692
Enough with the riddles.
You just tell me what you want.

42:10.904 --> 42:13.987
You will do things
you don't want to do.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.736
Lead our victory overnight.

42:16.952 --> 42:22.072
No. I will never
share your victory.

42:22.290 --> 42:28.160
Sometimes the greatest
evil is the greatest mercy.

42:28.380 --> 42:31.338
Nothing is ever
simple with you is it?

42:31.550 --> 42:33.461
I need real answers.

42:33.677 --> 42:35.213
[HADES] I have
given you all I can.

42:35.429 --> 42:38.887
The answer lies with you.

42:39.099 --> 42:41.511
A gift.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.441
The answer's in a gift.

42:51.653 --> 42:53.359
[knocking on door]

42:55.282 --> 42:57.273
[ZEE] You think--oh you
think you're special?

42:57.492 --> 42:59.107
You think you're strong?

42:59.327 --> 43:03.411
Everything you have
is because of him.

43:03.623 --> 43:06.831
Well maybe it
takes evil to fight evil.

43:07.043 --> 43:10.251
[ZEE] You don't know
what you're doing!

43:10.464 --> 43:20.465
