00:01.913 --> 00:04.218
How did Princess Kahiwalani die?

00:04.283 --> 00:05.718
Some say it was suicide.

00:05.784 --> 00:08.556
I saw her yesterday
at Pali-Uli's funeral.

00:09.855 --> 00:12.060
She is obsessed with the idea
that she is the Princess,

00:12.125 --> 00:13.126
come back to life.

00:13.726 --> 00:16.431
I don't think you're supposed to
go into dead people's houses.

03:33.528 --> 03:35.399
You, my beloved,

03:35.664 --> 03:37.601
are precious to me.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.771
Precious

03:40.837 --> 03:43.074
as that rare blossom.

03:45.108 --> 03:47.278
The soft falling rain

03:47.778 --> 03:50.918
comes to that flower as a lover,

03:51.315 --> 03:54.855
as I now come to you.

04:27.858 --> 04:30.763
Thought you were supposed to
be helping with the pageant.

04:33.130 --> 04:36.202
You know, T.C. here we are,

04:36.267 --> 04:38.805
living in paradise. I mean,

04:38.870 --> 04:42.344
look around you.
This place is incredible.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.514
And somehow, you get
in your day-to-day routine,

04:46.780 --> 04:50.621
and you really do forget
to stop to smell the flowers.

04:51.252 --> 04:52.520
You know what I mean?

04:52.586 --> 04:54.089
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
let Higgins catch you

04:54.154 --> 04:55.957
smelling the flowers
for too long.

04:56.023 --> 04:57.793
There you are,

04:58.861 --> 05:00.363
waiting for me.

05:01.764 --> 05:04.669
Come, be with me.

05:06.435 --> 05:08.506
In the cooling rain,

05:09.906 --> 05:11.609
I breathe.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.990
Jonathan? Just a moment, Agatha.

05:53.223 --> 05:56.128
I've just received a telephone
call from Mr. Kaimi.

05:56.193 --> 05:58.298
The Queen... No, no, no!

05:58.396 --> 05:59.598
Stage left!

05:59.798 --> 06:03.773
Stage left! If you exit stage
right, you'll collide with

06:05.471 --> 06:07.107
the missionaries.

06:07.273 --> 06:10.346
Whoa, whoa. Okay, gang, let's
make that exit stage left.

06:11.144 --> 06:13.548
Hey, Higgins!
I got it all rigged.

06:15.148 --> 06:16.684
This baby is all set to go.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.089
Fire-and-brimstone,
right on cue.

06:22.624 --> 06:24.027
It will be confetti. But
we'll have real smoke.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.363
But in all honesty, I think
just a few flashing lights

06:26.428 --> 06:27.549
and some colored gel would...

06:27.564 --> 06:29.601
Oh, come on, are you kidding, Higgins?
This is the opening number.

06:29.666 --> 06:31.503
We need something
to catch their attention.

06:31.568 --> 06:32.570
He's right, you know.

06:32.636 --> 06:33.704
William. Jonathan.

06:33.771 --> 06:37.078
I mean, what's a volcano without
fire and smoke? Just watch.

06:47.487 --> 06:50.861
Jonathan, about the phone call.

06:55.662 --> 06:58.034
Yeah, that'll catch their
attention, all right.

06:58.098 --> 06:59.459
I can't understand
what went wrong.

06:59.768 --> 07:03.476
They always say a bad dress rehearsal
ensures a perfect opening night.

07:03.539 --> 07:05.539
Come on, let's go and take
a look at little Kilauea,

07:05.574 --> 07:08.112
and see if we can figure
out where you went wrong.

07:09.378 --> 07:12.818
This check from the Downtown
Merchants' Association

07:13.350 --> 07:16.089
should cover the cost
of costumes and lights,

07:16.754 --> 07:18.891
and maybe even a better volcano.

07:19.157 --> 07:21.862
All of us in the Historical
Society are very grateful.

07:21.927 --> 07:25.034
Ah, forget it. I enjoy separating the
rich and famous from their checkbooks.

07:25.098 --> 07:26.400
Especially for a good cause.

07:26.465 --> 07:27.701
You save me a front row seat.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.169
Certainly. Okay.

07:29.502 --> 07:30.804
What is it, Agatha?

07:30.870 --> 07:34.545
Oh, Mr. Kaimi from Queen
Emma Summer Palace called.

07:34.608 --> 07:37.580
They're about to close, and he
wondered if you were still coming by

07:37.645 --> 07:41.353
for the historical artifacts they
agreed to loan for the exhibit.

07:41.416 --> 07:43.186
If I am still coming?

07:49.592 --> 07:53.266
I take it that it was
Mr. Magnum's responsibility.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.936
I'll call Mr. Kaimi back.

08:00.204 --> 08:01.740
I'll never forget the date.

08:01.806 --> 08:04.511
October 4, 1956.

08:04.577 --> 08:07.416
I was late to my
first saxophone lesson.

08:07.646 --> 08:10.084
It was bound to happen.
I was always cutting it close:

08:10.150 --> 08:12.855
To baseball practice,
to Boy Scouts, to school.

08:12.919 --> 08:14.756
It was a character trait
my mom said

08:14.821 --> 08:16.558
came from her side
of the family.

08:16.624 --> 08:18.159
The Sullivan side.

08:18.225 --> 08:20.563
That was the side
that always hated to be late,

08:20.628 --> 08:23.000
but hated even worse
being early.

08:23.065 --> 08:24.601
It was also the side
of the family

08:24.666 --> 08:27.806
that never knew how to say no
to a request from a friend.

08:27.871 --> 08:30.776
And never quite felt comfortable
saying yes, either.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.376
But once they've said yes,

08:32.442 --> 08:35.014
nothing would ever stop them
from doing the job.

08:35.078 --> 08:38.318
Nothing would ever take their
attention away from the task at hand.

09:53.536 --> 09:55.072
My mom never could explain to me

09:55.138 --> 09:58.178
why certain things seemed
to jump out of nowhere

09:58.242 --> 10:00.880
and grab the
Sullivan imagination.

10:00.945 --> 10:02.548
Neither could I.

10:02.714 --> 10:04.584
I just knew they did.

10:04.682 --> 10:08.122
And, I also knew, sometimes
it was best to let them go.

10:44.796 --> 10:46.266
Thomas!

11:04.552 --> 11:06.689
I'm afraid I'll have
to ask you to leave.

11:07.189 --> 11:08.959
Visiting hours are over.

11:09.024 --> 11:11.128
Oh! No, I'm...

11:12.195 --> 11:13.965
Mr., uh, Kaimi?

11:14.430 --> 11:16.000
Who are you?

11:16.066 --> 11:17.702
Oh, I'm Thomas Magnum.
I'm here to pick up...

11:17.767 --> 11:19.771
Oh, yes.
Mr. Higgins' delivery man.

11:19.837 --> 11:22.809
I have the items all packed
up for you right in here.

11:36.823 --> 11:38.193
Mr. Magnum?

11:42.029 --> 11:43.198
Who...

11:44.299 --> 11:46.837
Who was that woman
in the garden?

11:48.204 --> 11:50.207
Just now, there was
a woman out there.

11:51.273 --> 11:52.876
The same woman
that's in that picture.

11:53.809 --> 11:55.345
There was no woman
in the garden.

11:56.413 --> 11:58.818
Uh, I saw her.

11:58.949 --> 12:02.323
Optical illusion, Mr. Magnum. The afternoon
sun often creates shadows that...

12:02.386 --> 12:04.022
This was no shadow.

12:05.022 --> 12:07.427
The museum is closed.
The garden is closed.

12:07.492 --> 12:10.464
And there is no exit, except
through the house, past us.

12:10.696 --> 12:13.902
Now, please tell Mr. Higgins we will
arrange to have the artifacts picked up

12:13.967 --> 12:16.639
the day after
the pageant and exhibit.

12:37.927 --> 12:40.867
"Along the beach, men
and women, lads and lasses"

12:40.931 --> 12:46.743
"were returning from the bath in bright
raiment, red and blue and green,"

12:46.805 --> 12:51.648
"such as we delighted to see in the
colored little pictures of our childhood,"

12:52.044 --> 12:55.885
"and presently, the sun had
cleared the eastern hill"

12:56.149 --> 12:58.721
"and the glow of the day
was over all."

13:00.554 --> 13:02.224
Excellent, Agatha.

13:02.622 --> 13:03.958
Do you really think so?

13:04.025 --> 13:05.995
I believe we should give
you the place of honor,

13:06.060 --> 13:07.463
right at the end.

13:07.528 --> 13:08.863
Thank you.

13:10.132 --> 13:12.537
Here you are, Higgins. Safe
and sound, in plenty of time.

13:12.601 --> 13:15.340
You can't leave until I make
sure everything is here.

13:15.405 --> 13:17.643
I also have some selections
from Mark Twain,

13:17.707 --> 13:19.444
if you think they'd
be appropriate.

13:19.510 --> 13:21.180
It's all there.

13:21.245 --> 13:23.148
Okay, we've got it this time.

13:24.148 --> 13:28.357
Higgins, get ready for the opening
number of all opening numbers.

13:28.420 --> 13:29.488
Who is this?

13:29.553 --> 13:31.156
That's the Princess Kahiwalani.

13:31.223 --> 13:32.626
Descended from a chiefly line.

13:32.691 --> 13:34.929
She died tragically in 1910.

13:42.469 --> 13:43.471
I don't know
what happened. Uh...

13:43.538 --> 13:46.458
What do you mean, you don't know what
happened? I followed your directions!

13:46.807 --> 13:48.443
And look what they got us, T.C.!

13:48.509 --> 13:51.716
I'm through listening to you. Obviously,
you know less about this than I do.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.756
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.

14:55.821 --> 14:58.026
There had to be a
reasonable explanation

14:58.091 --> 15:01.163
for my stopping at a funeral
for someone I had never met.

15:01.228 --> 15:03.600
And there had to be
a logical explanation

15:03.664 --> 15:07.004
for being drawn to a woman
who I had never seen before.

15:07.068 --> 15:08.971
And who, according
to Higgins, at least,

15:09.037 --> 15:11.008
died nearly 80 years ago.

15:11.073 --> 15:14.880
There had to be a logical,
reasonable explanation.

15:14.943 --> 15:16.847
I just didn't know what it was.

15:16.913 --> 15:18.248
Magnum! Ah!

15:18.748 --> 15:20.685
There you are.

15:21.785 --> 15:24.490
This package arrived for
you early this morning.

15:24.554 --> 15:28.129
Naturally, I assumed it was some sort of
manufacturer's product sample giveaway

15:28.193 --> 15:30.530
before I noticed
the return address.

15:30.595 --> 15:34.035
Why would Pali-Uli Keahikapu
be sending you a package?

15:38.838 --> 15:40.541
I don't know.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.178
Who is Pali-Uli Keahikapu?

15:43.243 --> 15:46.183
Pali-Uli Keahikapu was
maid servant to Kahiwalani

15:46.247 --> 15:49.186
before the Princess's sudden
and unexpected demise.

15:49.483 --> 15:51.186
A fact I'm sure
you read for yourself

15:51.253 --> 15:53.457
in yesterday
afternoon's newspaper.

15:53.521 --> 15:55.726
Actually, I didn't have a
chance to read the paper...

15:59.495 --> 16:03.704
How odd. An American Navy lieutenant's
uniform from the turn of the century,

16:03.767 --> 16:06.005
identifiable primarily from...
l know, Higgins.

16:07.338 --> 16:08.708
I was wearing it.

16:08.806 --> 16:10.008
I beg your pardon?

16:10.508 --> 16:11.610
Nothing.

16:12.911 --> 16:14.246
Never mind.

16:16.849 --> 16:19.221
How did Princess Kahiwalani die?

16:19.719 --> 16:21.054
In a fire.

16:28.162 --> 16:30.300
Some say it was suicide.

16:48.552 --> 16:49.888
I saw her.

16:51.756 --> 16:54.695
This woman that you say
is Princess Kahiwalani

16:54.759 --> 16:57.297
I saw her yesterday
at Pali-Uli's funeral.

16:57.363 --> 16:59.801
I never said this was
Princess Kahiwalani.

16:59.865 --> 17:02.370
Of course, I see some
slight resemblance, but...

17:02.435 --> 17:04.573
That photograph
I showed you yesterday,

17:04.637 --> 17:06.875
you said she was
Princess Kahiwalani.

17:06.941 --> 17:09.078
The woman in that photo, yes.

17:09.176 --> 17:10.780
But this is not the same woman.

17:11.612 --> 17:14.384
This appears to be a photograph
of you and a young lady,

17:14.449 --> 17:17.188
who looks somewhat
like the Princess.

17:17.252 --> 17:18.555
Magnum, I know
what you're doing,

17:18.619 --> 17:20.423
and it's not going to work!

17:20.490 --> 17:24.198
Obviously, this is one of your clever little
practical jokes designed to unnerve me

17:24.261 --> 17:27.867
before the Gala Anglo-Hawaiian
Historical Society Pageant this week.

17:27.932 --> 17:29.735
However, I have
everything under control,

17:29.800 --> 17:32.071
and nothing could
disconcert me now.

17:34.673 --> 17:36.643
Oh, my God!

18:09.046 --> 18:10.916
Hi, Mom. It's me.

18:10.982 --> 18:13.721
We seem to be talking to each
other's machines a lot lately.

18:15.454 --> 18:18.861
I just wanted to talk to
you about family history.

18:20.994 --> 18:22.897
It's nothing important.

18:23.763 --> 18:25.165
I love you.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.402
Hello again.

19:56.438 --> 19:58.141
How did you get in here?

19:58.207 --> 19:59.208
Well, I'm glad you asked,

19:59.274 --> 20:03.048
because it seems there is a way
into and out of the garden.

20:03.112 --> 20:05.517
I'd be happy to show you
for future reference,

20:05.582 --> 20:07.452
in case you don't
already know where it is,

20:07.518 --> 20:09.053
which I think you do.

20:09.353 --> 20:11.623
You seem to know an awful
lot about Hawaiian history.

20:11.689 --> 20:13.727
How many of these little
things have you published?

20:13.791 --> 20:15.059
Three? Four?

20:15.126 --> 20:16.295
What is it you want?

20:16.361 --> 20:18.565
Oh! I want to know

20:18.698 --> 20:21.703
who that woman was
out in the garden yesterday,

20:21.767 --> 20:23.604
and I want to know why
you lied to me about it.

20:28.074 --> 20:29.844
I have a theory.
One that I didn't

20:29.910 --> 20:31.145
find in one of your
little books, there.

20:31.211 --> 20:32.847
Would you like to hear it?

20:33.481 --> 20:36.019
Well, I figure...

20:36.084 --> 20:38.689
Course, now, this is just conjecture
based on rumor and gossip,

20:38.753 --> 20:43.095
but I figure maybe she's the
granddaughter of Princess Kahiwalani.

20:43.192 --> 20:44.394
That's ridiculous!

20:44.460 --> 20:45.963
Well, it's just a theory.

20:46.028 --> 20:48.801
Like I said, it probably couldn't
be true, because if it were,

20:48.865 --> 20:51.604
somebody like you, with all
your publishing experience,

20:51.669 --> 20:53.572
would probably write
a little book about it

20:53.638 --> 20:55.174
and become rich and famous.

20:56.474 --> 20:58.846
That would be big news,
wouldn't it?

20:58.910 --> 21:00.848
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

21:00.913 --> 21:03.418
I'm leaving! I just wanted to hear
what you thought about my theory

21:03.483 --> 21:04.885
before I gave it to the press.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.988
You'd be making a big mistake.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.121
Yeah.

21:09.255 --> 21:10.691
All right, all right.

21:10.758 --> 21:12.528
The girl was here yesterday.

21:12.826 --> 21:14.396
And she does bear
a slight resemblance

21:14.462 --> 21:16.199
to Princess Kahiwalani.
Very slight.

21:16.263 --> 21:18.267
As a matter of fact, I was
startled when I saw you.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.136
You look a bit like...

21:20.736 --> 21:22.271
Like who?

21:22.338 --> 21:23.873
It doesn't matter.

21:23.939 --> 21:26.444
Like an American Navy
lieutenant, maybe?

21:26.509 --> 21:28.947
Someone who was very close
to Princess Kahiwalani?

21:29.011 --> 21:32.251
None of that matters. The point is,
she is a confused, neurotic girl

21:32.316 --> 21:35.088
who desperately wants to
believe that she's royalty.

21:35.152 --> 21:37.958
Well, I think I'd like
to decide that for myself.

21:38.022 --> 21:40.326
She thinks she is Kahiwalani!

21:47.266 --> 21:48.869
I have to warn you.

21:49.035 --> 21:52.408
She can be very convincing.
Most schizophrenics are.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.214
Easy. It's okay.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.552
Wait...

22:32.352 --> 22:33.922
Don't run away.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.825
I have to talk to you.

22:39.227 --> 22:40.897
Who sent you here?

22:41.996 --> 22:43.232
Nobody.

22:43.766 --> 22:45.736
Did my husband tell you...

22:46.368 --> 22:48.004
No.

22:49.239 --> 22:51.543
I have something that

22:52.342 --> 22:54.245
I think belongs to you.

22:56.547 --> 22:58.685
Princess Kahiwalani's locket.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.352
Where did you get it?

23:00.419 --> 23:02.189
It was sent to me

23:03.555 --> 23:06.595
by Pali-Uli Keahikapu.

23:08.728 --> 23:11.233
Why does everyone think I...

23:11.297 --> 23:12.466
What?

23:13.567 --> 23:16.874
If you're looking for a
donation, we already gave.

23:20.140 --> 23:22.144
You're bothering my wife.

23:22.812 --> 23:25.551
I just wanted to ask
her a few questions.

23:26.948 --> 23:29.888
I suggest you leave
before I call the police.

23:44.870 --> 23:47.442
The Magnum side of me
was saying, loud and clear,

23:47.506 --> 23:50.178
"Stay out of something that
isn't any of your business."

23:50.242 --> 23:54.585
But the Sullivan side kept me wondering
why Victoria seemed so frightened.

24:07.463 --> 24:09.233
Oh, hey, I'm really
sorry about this.

24:09.299 --> 24:10.935
I'm having a little problem
with my steering mechanism.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.337
Isn't that right, Dick?
Anyway, are you okay?

24:13.403 --> 24:14.405
Yeah I think so.

24:14.471 --> 24:15.639
Well that's good.

24:15.706 --> 24:17.509
Because the only reason
we pulled you over like that

24:17.574 --> 24:19.645
is, um, I have to deliver
something here.

24:51.965 --> 24:54.436
- That's very good.
- Very authentic.

24:54.602 --> 24:57.641
One could almost believe you
were in an actual altercation.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.676
I was in an altercation.

24:59.841 --> 25:01.009
Oh, incidentally,
your mother called.

25:01.075 --> 25:04.148
She said you wanted to ask her some
question about family history.

25:04.213 --> 25:05.849
Yeah. Well...

25:05.914 --> 25:08.552
I suppose you believe you had a
great-uncle who sailed the South Pacific

25:08.618 --> 25:10.154
and managed to get
his picture into a locket

25:10.220 --> 25:12.692
which would someday find its
way into your possession.

25:15.793 --> 25:17.663
Is that really
so completely far-fetched?

25:18.462 --> 25:19.698
Yes.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.237
Is this all you got
on Hawaiian history?

25:24.302 --> 25:26.940
I would think that all these
volumes would be sufficient

25:27.005 --> 25:28.174
to find whatever it is
you're looking for.

25:28.241 --> 25:29.343
What's that? What's what?

25:29.408 --> 25:30.409
That book there.
The book you were hiding.

25:30.476 --> 25:31.679
I'm not hiding anything.

25:31.745 --> 25:32.847
Aha.

25:33.547 --> 25:34.882
You were hiding it.

25:34.948 --> 25:36.651
Don't be ridiculous. Why
on earth would I hide...

25:36.718 --> 25:38.455
Gladys Shimpel's book!

25:38.520 --> 25:39.788
Why, Higgins?

25:39.853 --> 25:40.854
Why?

25:41.422 --> 25:43.794
Because it's Gladys
Shimpel's book, that's why!

25:43.858 --> 25:47.432
You expect me to believe that you've
even heard of Gladys Shimpel?

25:47.496 --> 25:49.099
The Islands' foremost
expert on Hawaiian history.

25:49.165 --> 25:51.068
Are you kidding? Everyone's
heard of Gladys Shimpel.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.673
And Gladys Shimpel's theory of
Princess Kahiwalani was never proved.

25:55.673 --> 25:57.633
You knew about this. That's
why you were hiding it.

25:57.675 --> 26:00.380
And just because it lends some
credence to your ridiculous theory...

26:00.444 --> 26:02.214
But isn't it possible
we're right,

26:02.280 --> 26:04.885
me and Gladys? It was all
conjecture and rumor.

26:04.949 --> 26:06.185
But possible,

26:06.251 --> 26:07.486
just possible,

26:07.553 --> 26:10.860
that Princess Kahiwalani had a son
the year she spent in England,

26:10.923 --> 26:13.228
the result of a romance with
an American Navy lieutenant.

26:13.293 --> 26:14.596
That's all well
and good, Magnum,

26:14.662 --> 26:16.732
but even if it were true,
even if,

26:17.431 --> 26:19.168
you're saying that this
man, William Keyes,

26:19.233 --> 26:21.605
kept his wife's identity
secret for years,

26:21.670 --> 26:23.206
and then sent two thugs
to beat you up

26:23.271 --> 26:25.375
when you began to get
too close to his secret.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.177
Well? Well, it's absurd.

26:27.242 --> 26:28.678
William Keyes
is a prominent citizen

26:28.744 --> 26:31.182
well known for his
philanthropic acts.

26:31.247 --> 26:34.086
Why would he suddenly start
behaving like a common criminal?

26:34.150 --> 26:35.620
I don't know, Higgins.

26:36.687 --> 26:38.524
But I intend to find out.

26:44.329 --> 26:46.467
Listen, Thomas,
I have about 500 things

26:46.532 --> 26:48.569
left to do for the pageant.
Come on, Rick, 500?

26:48.634 --> 26:51.373
That's a little bit of an exaggeration.
Don't you think?

26:51.971 --> 26:54.176
I have to pick the programs
up from the printers,

26:54.241 --> 26:55.777
I have to okay the costumes
for the dancers...

26:55.843 --> 26:57.913
This won't take any time at all!

26:58.011 --> 26:59.113
I'll have you back
in an hour, Rick!

26:59.179 --> 27:01.217
Yeah, yeah, that's
what you always say!

27:02.851 --> 27:04.353
It took a little digging,

27:04.419 --> 27:06.923
but I came up with
something on your boy.

27:06.989 --> 27:09.093
Personally, I'm always
a little suspicious

27:09.157 --> 27:11.495
of anybody that looks
as clean as William Keyes.

27:11.561 --> 27:14.133
Yeah, well I never tru!
Sted the guy either.

27:14.297 --> 27:16.067
Here you are, honey.

27:16.467 --> 27:17.502
What'd you find?

27:17.568 --> 27:19.405
Well, on the surface,

27:19.470 --> 27:21.708
it appears like he's a
very successful investor.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.779
Ah! Card one is the chariot!

27:25.844 --> 27:28.082
Triumph, victory, hope,

27:28.146 --> 27:29.181
success!

27:29.247 --> 27:31.285
That's great. She's
real good at this.

27:33.620 --> 27:37.127
You said that he appears to
be successful on the surface.

27:37.291 --> 27:38.726
- That's right.
- However,

27:38.793 --> 27:40.663
here we have the tower.

27:41.194 --> 27:44.034
Danger, ruin,
destruction of plans.

27:44.666 --> 27:45.802
Sudden death.

27:45.868 --> 27:47.605
Where?

27:47.670 --> 27:50.675
Excuse me. What's
underneath the surface?

27:50.874 --> 27:53.311
What? Huh? Under
the surface? Oh.

27:53.375 --> 27:56.850
He's a hustler who's into
some very big-time operators

27:56.947 --> 27:58.984
for a quarter of a million.

27:59.049 --> 28:01.487
Would you mind getting me
some more tea, dear?

28:02.186 --> 28:04.323
It's over there on the bar.

28:04.823 --> 28:07.127
How about you? No thanks,
I'm fine, ma'am.

28:10.997 --> 28:12.834
You think he's got the
money to pay them off?

28:12.899 --> 28:15.104
I know for a fact he doesn't.
He's flat broke.

28:15.168 --> 28:17.005
It's not the first time, either.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.914
Ice Pick, what are you doing?

28:24.979 --> 28:28.286
Sometimes you have to take the
future into your own hands.

28:30.218 --> 28:33.960
Oh, thank you, my dear.
Now, where were we?

28:35.826 --> 28:38.965
Card two. Four of disks.

28:39.329 --> 28:41.232
Four of disks! You hear that?

28:41.666 --> 28:43.135
Four of disks!

28:43.468 --> 28:46.407
Power. Law and order.

28:47.005 --> 28:49.343
Gain of money and influence.

28:49.408 --> 28:51.678
Didn't I tell you she was great?

28:52.111 --> 28:54.950
Your man's going to have to
come up with some money, fast.

28:55.014 --> 28:56.250
If the lady's in danger,

28:56.316 --> 28:58.219
it's going to come
from that corner.

28:58.284 --> 29:00.722
Well, we got to go.
Thanks, Ice Pick.

29:01.055 --> 29:03.059
Oh! Yeah. Nice meeting you.

29:03.290 --> 29:04.525
Goodbye.

29:05.092 --> 29:08.666
Now, what does the future
hold for me?

29:13.201 --> 29:16.107
I gotta give you credit. You said we'd be
less than an hour, and you were right.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.340
It's a good thing, too.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.877
'Cause I gotta be back
at the estate

29:18.942 --> 29:20.779
to give the usherettes
instructions at 2:OO.

29:21.812 --> 29:24.384
Usherettes? Dancers?

29:24.515 --> 29:26.987
Have you ever noticed that
all your urgent tasks

29:27.051 --> 29:28.922
seem to have something to do
with a bunch of pretty women?

29:28.988 --> 29:31.225
Uh-huh. Well, I will be back
at the estate by 2:OO.

29:31.289 --> 29:33.494
We could be. If our next
stop doesn't take too long.

29:33.559 --> 29:34.560
Thomas!

29:35.061 --> 29:37.398
I think this is a very bad idea.

29:56.820 --> 29:59.592
I don't think you're supposed to
go into dead people's houses.

29:59.689 --> 30:01.059
Ain't that against the
law or something?

30:01.125 --> 30:03.463
If you see anybody coming up
the road, just let me know.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.632
Wait, who's gonna be coming up the road?
I don't know!

30:06.698 --> 30:08.635
That's why I need somebody
to keep a lookout.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.138
Oh, great. Just great!

30:26.154 --> 30:28.792
Hey, will you hurry up? This
place gives me the creeps.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.688
One character
trait on the Magnum side

30:53.752 --> 30:56.023
extreme stubbornness.

30:56.421 --> 30:58.559
At least, that's what my
mom always called it.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.795
My dad liked to
call it perseverance.

31:02.228 --> 31:05.802
When all logic and reason told
me to stay away from this case,

31:05.866 --> 31:07.469
my stubborn streak took hold.

31:07.535 --> 31:10.274
I had to know
why this woman, Pali-Uli,

31:10.405 --> 31:13.711
had tried to draw me into her
world on the day that she died.

31:16.846 --> 31:18.683
I could only hope that she
had le Ft a clue behind,

31:18.748 --> 31:20.853
to give me
some sort of an answer.

31:28.593 --> 31:32.067
It was beginning to look
like she had done just that.

34:05.409 --> 34:07.714
Thomas! Someone's coming!

34:09.847 --> 34:11.952
Thomas, let's get out of here!

34:14.252 --> 34:15.420
Thomas!

34:20.960 --> 34:22.929
Come on, come on, let's go!

34:32.039 --> 34:34.143
Princess Kahiwalani
didn't commit suicide.

34:34.809 --> 34:36.112
She was killed by her husband.

34:36.178 --> 34:37.681
She and her Navy
lieutenant lover.

34:37.746 --> 34:38.746
I'd like to hear all about it,

34:38.813 --> 34:39.882
but could we get
the hell out of here?

34:39.947 --> 34:42.119
Which is exactly what Pali-Uli
thought was going to happen

34:42.185 --> 34:44.222
to Kahiwalani's
granddaughter, Victoria.

34:44.286 --> 34:45.456
Thomas!

35:03.726 --> 35:05.496
First of all, you
almost get me killed

35:05.562 --> 35:07.767
over somebody who's
been dead for 80 years.

35:07.831 --> 35:09.534
Then you expect me
to buy a story

35:09.600 --> 35:12.205
about Victoria Keyes,
princess reincarnated?

35:12.269 --> 35:14.072
I didn't almost get you killed!

35:14.139 --> 35:15.842
And I'm not asking you
to buy anything.

35:15.907 --> 35:18.312
I'm just telling you
what Pali-Uli believed.

35:18.543 --> 35:21.783
Now, she wrote that Kahiwalani's
husband found her and her lover,

35:21.847 --> 35:24.552
killed them both, and then
set fire to the house.

35:24.650 --> 35:26.755
That's very interesting, Thomas,

35:26.820 --> 35:28.423
but I got to tell you,

35:28.488 --> 35:30.993
I'm a little busy right now,
so if you'll excuse me...

35:31.059 --> 35:33.163
So you're saying
Victoria is doomed

35:33.227 --> 35:35.933
to repeat Kahiwalani's death
at her husband's hands

35:35.998 --> 35:38.068
unless the karma
is somehow broken.

35:38.133 --> 35:40.538
Right. That is, if you
believe the theory.

35:42.772 --> 35:44.274
And you're going
to buy into this?

35:44.340 --> 35:45.576
Yeah, I'm still holding.

35:45.642 --> 35:48.080
If it were karma, and if
she had to repeat it,

35:48.145 --> 35:50.382
the Navy officer would
have to die with her.

35:50.447 --> 35:53.620
Oh, come on. That's all
superstitions and ghost stories.

35:53.684 --> 35:57.592
Without a doubt. Although there are
some of perhaps inferior intellect

35:57.656 --> 36:00.294
who support the theory
of reincarnation.

36:00.359 --> 36:03.766
First of all why would! Keyes

36:03.830 --> 36:07.772
believe that Victoria was the
granddaughter of the Princess?

36:07.835 --> 36:10.540
Desperate people have a way of
finding out all kinds of things.

36:10.604 --> 36:12.007
Yeah, I'm still here. Go ahead.

36:12.073 --> 36:14.177
Not that I for a moment
entertained the idea,

36:14.242 --> 36:17.215
but it was once proposed to
me that I embody the spirit

36:17.279 --> 36:20.619
of a rather brilliant military
advisor to Catherine the Great.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.453
I'm certain if I were
to mention his name,

36:22.518 --> 36:25.090
you'd see the similarity
in character traits

36:25.155 --> 36:27.158
which would make such an
observation possible,

36:27.224 --> 36:28.627
however misguided.

36:31.829 --> 36:34.266
However, that's hardly the
important issue at the moment.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.905
Thanks, Darla. I owe you one.

36:37.970 --> 36:42.079
The problem is, if we accept any
part of this bizarre theory...

36:42.142 --> 36:45.047
There's no way of proving that Keyes
is planning to murder his wife.

36:45.111 --> 36:46.112
Precisely.

36:46.179 --> 36:49.386
Just because Pali-Uli believed
it, it is hardly probable cause.

36:49.449 --> 36:52.823
But maybe a $500,OOO
insurance policy is.

36:52.887 --> 36:55.259
Especially if it contains
a suicide clause.

36:56.390 --> 36:59.697
There's someone else besides
Pali-Uli who knows about this.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.836
She wanted to take some of Princess
Kahiwalani's personal articles.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.637
They belong to the museum.

37:05.702 --> 37:08.240
I couldn't just let them go
to some crazy woman.

37:08.305 --> 37:09.975
And what made you think
she was crazy?

37:10.040 --> 37:11.877
She thinks she's Kahiwalani!

37:11.942 --> 37:14.915
She's obsessed with the idea that
she's the Princess come back to life.

37:14.979 --> 37:16.348
Did she tell you that?

37:16.413 --> 37:18.016
No! Her husband did.

37:19.351 --> 37:20.686
He called.

37:21.654 --> 37:25.194
Yes, he called several times,
asking for certain items.

37:25.959 --> 37:28.263
He apologized, said he was
humoring his wife,

37:28.328 --> 37:30.566
that she had all kinds
of fantasies that included...

37:30.630 --> 37:32.100
Suicide.

37:32.166 --> 37:34.738
A fixation on Kahiwalani's
suicide, actually.

37:38.307 --> 37:39.777
Oma'oma'o Valley.

37:41.076 --> 37:42.746
Oma'oma'o Valley.

37:42.811 --> 37:45.416
A house was built for Princess
Kahiwalani and her husband.

37:46.182 --> 37:47.518
It was never lived in.

37:47.584 --> 37:50.856
William Keyes said his wife was obsessed
with restoring it and living in it.

37:51.722 --> 37:54.894
He said she wanted to
recreate Kahiwalani's life.

38:24.326 --> 38:27.700
The ancient Hawaiians
called it hana hope.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.901
Some people called it karma.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.739
My grandfather
called it destiny.

38:33.804 --> 38:35.909
But then, he was a Sullivan.

38:37.608 --> 38:39.311
I didn't know whether
to believe it or not,

38:39.378 --> 38:42.818
but whether Victoria was living out
the destiny of her famous grandmother

38:42.881 --> 38:45.386
or simply in trouble
all on her own,

38:45.451 --> 38:47.889
I knew I had to do
whatever I could to help her.

40:10.683 --> 40:12.284
Somebody should've
heard from him by now.

40:12.586 --> 40:14.066
He'd let us know
if he was in trouble.

40:14.087 --> 40:15.088
If he could.

40:15.155 --> 40:17.693
We should send someone over
to William Keyes' house.

40:17.758 --> 40:19.128
Pre-show jitters?

40:21.229 --> 40:25.037
William! Uh, Mr. Keyes, I, uh...
That is, uh...

40:25.100 --> 40:27.638
Don't worry, Jonathan, everything
is going to go like clockwork.

40:27.703 --> 40:31.544
Yes, I'm quite sure
your... Where is...

40:31.608 --> 40:33.579
ls Mrs. Keyes
attending the performance?

40:33.643 --> 40:37.384
No. No, I'm afraid she came
down with a bad headache.

40:37.448 --> 40:39.251
I left her in her bed. We'll
see you after the show?

40:39.317 --> 40:40.620
Yes. Good.

41:44.326 --> 41:45.327
Ah.

42:13.159 --> 42:17.334
"And presently the sun had
cleared the eastern hill"

42:17.732 --> 42:20.537
"and the glow, , of the day
was no more."

42:47.132 --> 42:50.739
I have the honor

42:50.802 --> 42:54.544
to present to you the man who
made this pageant possible,

42:54.608 --> 42:58.182
for without his
fundraising efforts,

42:58.245 --> 43:02.320
we would not have been able to
present this program to you today.

43:02.383 --> 43:05.088
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. William Keyes.

43:41.195 --> 43:42.798
Thanks.

44:05.456 --> 44:06.826
I know what you're thinking.

44:06.891 --> 44:08.494
And I agree.

44:08.861 --> 44:11.766
There was nothing more to
Pali-Uli's theory of reincarnation,

44:11.830 --> 44:14.870
than the workings of
a romantic, imaginative mind,

44:14.934 --> 44:19.176
and the devious, manipulative
mind of William Keyes.

44:19.239 --> 44:22.044
And, maybe, a little
wishful daydreaming

44:22.376 --> 44:24.713
on the part of
Thomas Sullivan Magnum.

44:24.780 --> 44:26.282
Oh, there you are.

44:27.215 --> 44:30.155
I've just seen Victoria,
Mrs. Keyes,

44:30.219 --> 44:31.822
off at the airport.

44:32.822 --> 44:36.563
She asked me
to give you this note.

44:47.104 --> 44:50.277
Dear Thomas. Please
forgive me for leaving

44:50.342 --> 44:53.415
without stopping by
to at least say thank you.

44:53.479 --> 44:56.953
Somehow "thank you"
seemed so inadequate,

44:57.016 --> 44:59.755
and I wasn't quite sure
what else to say.

44:59.853 --> 45:04.295
I know there must be some reason our lives
were drawn together so mysteriously.

45:04.359 --> 45:08.300
But I also know sometimes it's
foolish to go chasing down reasons.

45:08.363 --> 45:10.401
Maybe it's better
to just accept it

45:10.766 --> 45:12.136
and let it go.

45:13.002 --> 45:16.642
So I guess I'll just say
mahalo and goodbye.

45:18.441 --> 45:22.449
She also asked me
to give you this.

45:27.351 --> 45:28.687
It's

45:29.721 --> 45:33.261
quite a remarkable photograph
of Princess Kahiwalani

45:33.325 --> 45:36.432
one Pali-Uli had kept
in her private collection.

45:38.732 --> 45:43.208
So I guess we can put this
reincarnation theory to rest,

45:43.270 --> 45:45.307
once and for all.

45:47.107 --> 45:49.312
I guess we can, Higgins.

45:51.179 --> 45:52.715
Mahalo.
