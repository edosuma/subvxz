00:45.606 --> 00:48.306
THEY CHANT: Through the evening
shadows waning

00:48.306 --> 00:51.166
dark is slain by light divine.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.706
Mystic arts craft unrestraining.

00:54.706 --> 00:57.326
Mighty architect divine.

00:58.786 --> 01:00.906
Hailed eternal to the end,

01:00.906 --> 01:06.786
the master of enlightened art doth
through all thy words extend.

01:06.786 --> 01:10.786
To our initiate, let us depart.

01:12.966 --> 01:14.666
Who comes here?

01:26.566 --> 01:29.646
Mr Bernard, who has
long been in darkness,

01:29.646 --> 01:31.986
and now seeks
to be brought to light.

01:31.986 --> 01:34.026
Having been in a state of darkness,

01:34.026 --> 01:36.546
what is the predominant wish
in your heart? Light.

01:36.546 --> 01:41.006
Then let that blessing be restored.

01:41.006 --> 01:45.066
In thy presence
doth this man be vying,

01:45.066 --> 01:48.306
begging for they love undying,

01:48.306 --> 01:49.986
so mote it be.

01:49.986 --> 01:53.166
Great Architect of the Universe,

01:53.166 --> 01:55.466
grant that this candidate
for Masonry

01:55.466 --> 01:57.906
may so dedicate and
devote his life to Thy service.

01:57.906 --> 02:01.286
May he be assisted by
the secrets of our Masonic art,

02:01.286 --> 02:04.346
and enabled to display
the beauties of true godliness.

02:04.346 --> 02:06.626
So mote it be.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.746
So mote it be.

02:08.746 --> 02:11.846
I most solemnly swear
my devotion to the secrets revealed,

02:11.846 --> 02:16.266
obedience to the Craft,
and loyalty to this Lodge,

02:16.266 --> 02:18.506
binding myself under
no less penalty

02:18.506 --> 02:22.866
than to have my throat cut across,
my tongue torn out

02:22.866 --> 02:26.706
and my body buried in the sea,
so help me God.

02:26.706 --> 02:31.006
Brother Initiate, it is with
great pleasure that I extend to you,

02:31.006 --> 02:35.046
on behalf of the Craft,
a hearty welcome.

02:39.966 --> 02:42.106
HE SPLUTTERS

02:42.106 --> 02:44.526
Brother Bernard?

02:47.746 --> 02:50.066
Is Brother Junior Steward here?

02:50.066 --> 02:51.966
Bloody hell, he's stopped breathing.

02:53.566 --> 02:55.866
He's dead. Brother Senior Steward?

02:55.866 --> 02:57.446
Yes, sir.

02:57.446 --> 03:02.586
Send for Detective Murdoch.
Tell him there's a crime scene
in King Solomon's Temple.

03:10.446 --> 03:13.926
His name is Victor Bernard,
a newly-entered apprentice.

03:13.926 --> 03:17.426
He applied for his first
degree a few months ago.

03:17.426 --> 03:19.546
And he died right
in front of you, sir?

03:19.546 --> 03:21.566
Yes, hell of a thing.

03:21.566 --> 03:23.486
It only took a few seconds.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.966
He started foaming at the mouth
just after he took the blood oath.

03:28.966 --> 03:31.026
Blood oath? Sir, he was drinking...?

03:31.026 --> 03:33.266
Not actual blood, Murdoch. Wine.

03:33.266 --> 03:35.046
Oh, and it's been secured.

03:38.626 --> 03:40.426
Right, then. Who brought the wine?

03:40.426 --> 03:42.726
Brother Boswell.
He opened it right in front of us.

03:42.726 --> 03:45.166
And who was present during
this blood oath?

03:45.166 --> 03:48.826
Lodge members exclusively. Crabtree's
got them assembled in another room.

03:48.826 --> 03:51.246
Sirs, the brethren are
terribly distraught.

03:51.246 --> 03:54.526
Would you like to speak to them now?
Yes, please, George, thank you.

03:54.526 --> 03:58.386
Worshipful Master, Eugene Anderson.

03:58.386 --> 04:00.386
Ah. You're not a Mason.

04:00.386 --> 04:02.866
No. How did you know?

04:02.866 --> 04:04.986
Er, there's a handshake, sir.

04:04.986 --> 04:08.866
Brother Anderson,
this is Detective Murdoch.
I can personally vouch for him.

04:08.866 --> 04:12.426
I understand that we need your
detective here, Brother Brackenreid.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.826
But we would all
feel more comfortable if

04:14.826 --> 04:17.906
your superior brother led
the investigation. You are joking?

04:17.906 --> 04:22.986
Brother Crabtree, you may supervise
police proceedings within the Lodge.

04:22.986 --> 04:26.366
George, are you superior
to the Inspector here?

04:26.366 --> 04:30.586
Yes, sir. A Mason can
advance to the third degree
of Freemasonry by choice.

04:30.586 --> 04:36.126
After that, a brother must be
expressly invited to ascend
to the next level.

04:36.126 --> 04:39.986
And Brother Brackenreid's offences
have kept his invitations at bay.

04:39.986 --> 04:42.506
Contemptuous language,
general disobedience...

04:42.506 --> 04:45.246
Contemptuous language, mostly.

04:50.195 --> 04:53.655
Brother Crabtree, the night is
getting long. Let's get on with it.

04:53.655 --> 04:55.935
Yes, Brother Crabtree.

04:57.495 --> 04:59.175
How do you suggest we proceed?

04:59.175 --> 05:02.835
I suggest we send for Dr Ogden,

05:02.835 --> 05:08.615
make sure the Brethren are
co-operative, and let Detective
Murdoch do his job. Very well.

05:08.615 --> 05:12.175
I should also like to pass
the reins of the investigation
back to the Inspector.

05:12.175 --> 05:14.295
Ah. Right. Excellent decision.

05:14.295 --> 05:16.815
Very well then.

05:16.815 --> 05:21.295
Where shall we begin? With you, sir.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.715
Are you an atheist?

05:25.715 --> 05:27.375
I beg your pardon?

05:27.375 --> 05:31.835
Are you an atheist?
I ask only because,
as our constitution clearly states,

05:31.835 --> 05:38.055
quote, "you cannot allow the
stupid atheist to infiltrate we who
are obliged to obey the moral law."

05:38.055 --> 05:39.975
No, sir, I am a Catholic.

05:39.975 --> 05:42.255
A Papist. I suppose that's better.

05:42.255 --> 05:45.455
Sir, did you know the victim well?

05:45.455 --> 05:51.955
No. But he showed promise -
a sincere wish to be serviceable to
the Great Architect of the Universe.

05:51.955 --> 05:54.295
The Great Architect of the Universe?

05:54.295 --> 05:57.395
God. Ah. I see.

05:57.395 --> 06:00.135
Do you know of anyone who wanted
to harm Victor Bernard?

06:00.135 --> 06:04.495
No - he was a decent,
orderly, quiet man.

06:04.495 --> 06:07.735
Had he been having any troubles
lately? I wouldn't know.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.915
Was he friends with anyone here?

06:09.915 --> 06:14.055
I suppose the man who first
proposed him - Brother Winters.

06:15.655 --> 06:17.695
We met six months ago.

06:17.695 --> 06:20.435
My law firm is in the same
building as his accounting firm.

06:20.435 --> 06:23.415
Victor was a clever chap.

06:23.415 --> 06:25.555
Amiable. Very droll.

06:25.555 --> 06:27.495
So you proposed him? Yes.

06:27.495 --> 06:30.695
He was a genuinely great
addition to the Brotherhood.

06:30.695 --> 06:33.735
Though I admit I had ulterior
motives in sponsoring him.

06:33.735 --> 06:35.515
Oh? Such as?

06:35.515 --> 06:37.755
Victor was a brilliant accountant.

06:39.535 --> 06:44.295
Please don't share this with anyone,
but I had asked him to look
at the Lodge's accounts.

06:44.295 --> 06:47.375
Doesn't the Lodge have its own
treasurer? Yes. Elias Boswell.

06:47.375 --> 06:51.675
But let's just say
that when he drinks he tends
to brag about things he cannot

06:51.675 --> 06:54.875
afford on a banker's salary.
You suspected him of skimming funds?

06:54.875 --> 06:59.835
Yes. I thought Victor could
discreetly examine the books,
do a sort of internal audit.

06:59.835 --> 07:03.695
Did he find anything?
I don't know. He wasn't finished.

07:03.695 --> 07:05.635
I see.

07:05.635 --> 07:09.795
There is a dead man in
the Temple and he wants
to look into our accounts?

07:09.795 --> 07:13.375
Sir, there has been word of concern
over your bookkeeping methods.

07:13.375 --> 07:15.715
Which could be mistaken as motive.

07:15.715 --> 07:18.755
The accounts book is kept
in a secret, sacred place.

07:18.755 --> 07:22.335
A place it cannot leave. I'm not
concerned with showing you the book.

07:22.335 --> 07:24.575
I'm concerned with
revealing where it is kept.

07:24.575 --> 07:28.675
Brother Boswell, don't make this
difficult. Just show us the book.

07:33.255 --> 07:36.055
Sir... These shapes,
what do they mean?

07:36.055 --> 07:38.415
I've seen them throughout the Lodge.

07:38.415 --> 07:43.635
According to history, the architect
for each Lodge incorporates
the symbols into the design.

07:43.635 --> 07:45.795
It's called the Masonic Cipher.

07:45.795 --> 07:48.295
Cipher? So each shape
has a corresponding letter?

07:48.295 --> 07:49.935
Mm. That's intriguing.

07:49.935 --> 07:51.895
Sirs!

07:51.895 --> 07:55.955
You must come. He's taking us
to the Hiram Room. The Hiram Room?
Bloody hell.

07:55.955 --> 07:58.335
The Hiram Room?

08:00.275 --> 08:04.195
Sir, the Hiram Room
was named for Hiram Abiff.

08:04.195 --> 08:07.015
He was the legendary chief
architect of King Solomon's Temple.

08:07.015 --> 08:11.335
He was murdered for refusing
to divulge the Master Mason's
secret password. Which is?

08:11.335 --> 08:13.235
Oh, sir,
I couldn't possibly tell you.

08:16.415 --> 08:19.215
Where I am about to show you,
you must share with no-one.

08:19.215 --> 08:23.475
Particularly the others -
they will not be pleased to learn
that I let you see this.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.975
The others, sir?

08:27.975 --> 08:32.615
Only 33-Degree Masons have access
to the room. We have three of them.

08:32.615 --> 08:35.015
Brother Boswell is one -
the other two are away overseas.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.414
What about Anderson?

08:37.414 --> 08:39.495
I thought he was
the head...pooh-bah.

08:39.495 --> 08:41.735
Brother Anderson is
the Worshipful Master,

08:41.735 --> 08:43.695
but he is not
nearly a 33rd Degree Mason.

08:43.695 --> 08:46.855
Degrees and positions at
the Lodge are separate affairs.

08:46.855 --> 08:49.875
And really, Murdoch, "pooh-bah"?
This isn't Gilbert and Sullivan.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.295
You are all sworn to secrecy.

08:52.295 --> 08:54.515
Especially the Papist.

08:54.515 --> 08:56.115
Excellent.

09:02.995 --> 09:04.435
Oh, my.

09:18.935 --> 09:20.635
The accounts book you requested.

09:30.855 --> 09:33.735
An original page of sheet
music from The Magic Flute.

09:33.735 --> 09:36.255
Mozart was extremely enlightened.

09:36.255 --> 09:39.655
And a good friend of the man
who founded the Illuminati.

09:41.235 --> 09:47.295
But I thought the Illuminati
was considered heretical,
and officially suppressed.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.275
Yes, of course they were.

09:55.355 --> 10:00.115
Gentlemen, no disrespect intended,
but do either of you know
anything about accounting?

10:00.115 --> 10:08.815
We've got dues paid, initiation fees,
charitable association deposits, and
not one withdrawal over ten dollars.

10:08.815 --> 10:12.975
From my understanding of
the Lodge's practices, sir,
these look to be in order.

10:12.975 --> 10:14.895
GONG SOUNDS

10:14.895 --> 10:16.355
That will be Dr Ogden. Oh.

10:27.615 --> 10:29.635
Brother Anderson,
open that bloody door.

10:29.635 --> 10:32.815
Absolutely not.
There's a woman out there.

10:32.815 --> 10:34.715
It's Doctor Ogden. She must come in.

10:34.715 --> 10:38.415
This is outrageous. We have
accepted your Papist as a visitor.

10:38.415 --> 10:42.835
But to ask us to allow
this woman to... Excuse me,
Brothers. Let her in.

10:42.835 --> 10:48.295
It's too much. Sir,
a coroner must tend to the body,
and Dr Ogden is second to none.

10:48.295 --> 10:52.555
At the very least, she should
swear an oath of secrecy.

10:52.555 --> 10:55.055
I think my Hippocratic Oath
trumps yours.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.235
Cheeky thing, isn't she?

10:57.235 --> 11:00.135
Yes, that she is.

11:00.135 --> 11:03.375
But she's hardly a thing, sir.

11:11.815 --> 11:13.455
Any initial thoughts, Doctor?

11:13.455 --> 11:18.055
He's quite flushed.
Could be a reaction to something.

11:18.055 --> 11:21.215
His tongue is engorged.
From the bloody foam around

11:21.215 --> 11:24.375
his mouth, I suspect his
throat is swollen shut as well.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.355
He died of asphyxia then?

11:26.355 --> 11:29.375
Yes. From poison, it would seem.

11:32.595 --> 11:38.535
Sir, these Brothers of yours -
they're not the most
forthcoming bunch.

11:38.535 --> 11:41.575
They're not a bad lot. We do
a great deal of work for charity.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.815
I do admit, the rituals
are laid on a bit thick.

11:44.815 --> 11:46.435
Ah, yes, the blood oath.

11:46.435 --> 11:49.975
And this from a man who drinks the
blood of Christ every Sunday morning.

11:49.975 --> 11:53.975
WOMAN SOBS FAINTLY

11:53.975 --> 11:58.455
Sir, we interviewed
all of the Masons that were
present here this evening.

11:58.455 --> 12:01.855
And none of you seemed to
know the victim very well.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.515
Then we'll need to take
a closer look, won't we?

12:06.055 --> 12:07.195
Yes, we will.

12:14.189 --> 12:16.749
Sir, I spoke to a few of
Victor's fellow boarders.

12:16.749 --> 12:18.729
And what did you learn, George?

12:18.729 --> 12:21.009
Apparently he moved in
about eight months ago.

12:21.009 --> 12:23.669
Buried himself in his work.
Pretty much kept to himself.

12:23.669 --> 12:28.249
By all accounts, he was a quiet,
orderly, very amiable man.

12:28.249 --> 12:31.729
Friends, family?
None that were mentioned.
Higgins is looking into it.

12:31.729 --> 12:35.849
One interesting thing, sir.
Mr Bernard let on recently that

12:35.849 --> 12:40.129
he thought he was being followed
by a mystery man of sorts.

12:40.129 --> 12:43.269
That would explain the window.
It's been nailed shut.

12:43.269 --> 12:46.789
Had any of the neighbours
seen this mystery man? No, sir.

12:46.789 --> 12:49.009
Do you think he could be our killer?

12:49.009 --> 12:50.209
Possibly.

12:51.329 --> 12:52.749
HE WHISTLES

12:52.749 --> 12:54.809
Sir, how many
pairs of shoes do you own?

12:54.809 --> 12:56.429
Two.

12:56.429 --> 12:57.889
Myself as well.

13:01.729 --> 13:03.889
These were made in Italy.

13:03.889 --> 13:05.969
The craftsmanship is sublime.

13:07.909 --> 13:11.849
George, do you recognise
any of the men in this photograph?

13:11.849 --> 13:16.209
No. Friends from his home town?
Wherever that is.

13:20.289 --> 13:23.389
Have you seen anything that
would accommodate this key, George?

13:23.389 --> 13:24.569
I haven't, sir.

13:27.609 --> 13:30.769
I hope the Inspector is
having better luck with
Mr Bernard's employer.

13:33.129 --> 13:37.789
I'm afraid not. Victor Bernard
joined Ashner Associates Accounting
Company seven months ago.

13:37.789 --> 13:40.329
A first-rate accountant,
with a real flair for numbers.

13:40.329 --> 13:44.889
And let me guess, he was described
as quiet, orderly and amiable.
Yes. Almost to the letter.

13:44.889 --> 13:47.369
Sirs...

13:47.369 --> 13:49.789
I have just been down to
the city registry office.

13:49.789 --> 13:52.589
There is no record of Mr Bernard
beyond eight months ago.

13:52.589 --> 13:55.809
Well, he didn't just appear
out of thin air, did he?

13:55.809 --> 13:59.569
Sirs, Dr Ogden has requested an
immediate audience with all of you.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.529
Do you have something
for us, Doctor? Yes.

14:03.529 --> 14:07.869
As I first suspected, Victor Bernard
died of some sort of toxicity.
He was poisoned.

14:07.869 --> 14:12.369
Other than the wine, the stomach
was empty, so no poison was
ingested prior to the initiation.

14:12.369 --> 14:16.189
And there is no indication
of puncture wounds or
inhalation of gas.

14:16.189 --> 14:22.729
As fascinating as this is, Doctor,
did you really need to drag us all
down here? Yes, I think I did.

14:22.729 --> 14:26.409
There's one more very important
fact you're going to need to know.

14:30.649 --> 14:33.529
Is that...? Are those...?

14:49.649 --> 14:53.289
You mean to tell me that...
Gentlemen, Victor Bernard
was a woman.

14:58.889 --> 15:02.649
I passed water with that... That
woman standing right beside me.

15:02.649 --> 15:05.709
Fascinating, sir.

15:05.709 --> 15:09.689
What's even more fascinating
was that she wasn't just
dressing as a man.

15:09.689 --> 15:14.069
She was living her life as a man.
But for what purpose?
Clearly the woman was insane.

15:14.069 --> 15:18.209
Or, sir, maybe she was an escaped
convict, on the run. Or a spy.

15:18.209 --> 15:22.289
Crabtree, you've read
too many Penny Dreadfuls.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.849
Not to be indelicate, sir,
but the Lodge is an exclusive club,

15:25.849 --> 15:29.149
and where there is exclusivity
there are often secrets.

15:29.149 --> 15:32.709
Where there are secrets
there are those willing to
do anything to keep them.

15:32.709 --> 15:33.789
What do you think we are?

15:33.789 --> 15:37.209
What kind of man do you
think would kill a woman
for infiltrating a Lodge?

15:38.769 --> 15:43.149
No, no, no. This is ludicrous.

15:43.149 --> 15:47.609
There's obviously been some
confusion at the morgue, or...
There is no confusion, Mr Anderson.

15:47.609 --> 15:49.729
Victor Bernard was a woman.

15:49.729 --> 15:53.729
And it's obvious that you
disapprove of women. Of course I do.

15:53.729 --> 15:56.449
Emotional, erratic creatures.

15:56.449 --> 16:00.249
But to know we were duped by one
is cause for humiliation, not anger.

16:00.249 --> 16:01.869
Right, then.

16:01.869 --> 16:05.329
What would have happened had a
woman been discovered in the Lodge?

16:05.329 --> 16:08.389
She would have been dismissed
quietly and discreetly.

16:08.389 --> 16:13.329
And if anyone knew this secret,
it would have been someone
who knew him well.

16:13.329 --> 16:15.569
Or rather...her.

16:20.049 --> 16:25.169
I don't understand.
I saw Victor several times a week.

16:25.169 --> 16:28.729
He dined regularly at our house.

16:28.729 --> 16:33.629
All that time you'd spent with her,
you had no idea she was a woman?
No. Never.

16:33.629 --> 16:37.449
You say Victor dined
at your home frequently.

16:37.449 --> 16:39.889
Perhaps Mrs Winters
sensed something?

16:39.889 --> 16:43.589
Miriam and I have no secrets. None.

16:43.589 --> 16:47.069
Perhaps when you discovered
her secret you felt betrayed.

16:47.069 --> 16:50.969
After all, you had been
great friends with a man who
turned out to be a woman.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.489
Damn it, sir, a friend
of mine just died. I...

16:56.369 --> 16:58.749
I wouldn't...

16:58.749 --> 17:01.389
I couldn't...
Apparently she was being followed.

17:01.389 --> 17:05.309
Did you know that? No. It appears
I didn't know much at all.

17:08.229 --> 17:10.888
So what are we looking for, sir?
We need fresh eyes on this.

17:10.888 --> 17:14.189
While investigating the murder of
Victor the man, we may have missed

17:14.189 --> 17:16.809
something significant about
Victor the woman.

17:16.809 --> 17:18.909
I know exactly what we missed, sir.
Oh?

17:18.909 --> 17:23.309
The shoes. Not the shoes themselves,
but the sheer number of them.

17:23.309 --> 17:27.769
My 16-year-old cousin Penny has an
obsession with fashionable footwear.

17:27.769 --> 17:30.789
Sir, I think all women share
a strange fascination with shoes.

17:30.789 --> 17:33.889
Surely that's an exaggeration,
George. I wouldn't be sure, sir.

17:37.409 --> 17:41.849
Wait, George. Something's different.

17:46.929 --> 17:51.249
There. The picture of Victor
and his...her friends. It's gone.

17:54.489 --> 17:56.669
The man with the cane.

17:56.669 --> 18:00.249
George, we may have just passed
our killer in the stairwell.

18:15.609 --> 18:18.049
Here, in here.

18:23.789 --> 18:27.009
Carry on down the corridor, George.
I'll check out these rooms. Sir.

18:41.349 --> 18:44.289
THEY SHRIEK
Oh, I, I...

18:44.289 --> 18:48.209
Do not disturb. I believe that's what
the sign on the door clearly says.

18:48.209 --> 18:49.989
I...

18:49.989 --> 18:51.229
I apologise, Miss.

18:51.229 --> 18:53.989
You know, it's trying enough,
sir, to have to endure these

18:53.989 --> 18:56.769
second-rate facilities passed down
from the men's teams,

18:56.769 --> 18:59.589
but to also be denied
privacy is quite unacceptable.

18:59.589 --> 19:04.209
I'm very sorry. Or perhaps
you're some kind of peeping Tom.

19:09.889 --> 19:13.169
Sir, there's no sign of, er... Hi.

19:13.169 --> 19:14.969
Excuse me!

19:14.969 --> 19:16.929
George, come here.

19:16.929 --> 19:19.069
Er, just, er, just give us a moment.

19:22.169 --> 19:26.049
Ah! Victor Bernard's
locker, no doubt. Yes.

19:28.909 --> 19:30.809
Masonic Cipher.

19:30.809 --> 19:32.509
Why would she record that?

19:34.369 --> 19:36.649
Sir...

19:36.649 --> 19:38.909
This list of charities...

19:38.909 --> 19:41.489
Our Lodge has raised money
for each and every one of these.

19:41.489 --> 19:45.669
Sir, I think this is the audit that
Brother Winters was speaking of.

19:45.669 --> 19:48.269
Yes. It would seem Victor,
or whoever she was,

19:48.269 --> 19:52.329
was comparing Lodge accounts against
those of the actual charities.

19:52.329 --> 19:56.489
We have to get Higgins to find out
everything we can about
the Treasurer, Mr Boswell.

19:56.489 --> 19:59.049
Excuse me!

19:59.049 --> 20:00.489
That is private property.

20:00.489 --> 20:03.249
Yes, the property of
a dead woman, I'm afraid.

20:04.969 --> 20:07.269
Her name is Grace Read.

20:07.269 --> 20:10.149
You know she died
in a Masonic Lodge.

20:10.149 --> 20:11.809
Dressed in men's clothing.

20:11.809 --> 20:15.529
Yes. How strange. And aside
from playing on this women's

20:15.529 --> 20:18.969
basketball team, it appears she'd
been living out her life as a man.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.869
Really?

20:21.869 --> 20:24.109
She was also deathly afraid
of someone.

20:24.109 --> 20:26.829
We followed that person
to this location.

20:26.829 --> 20:30.289
Do any of you know who he is?

20:30.289 --> 20:32.269
No, sir.

20:32.269 --> 20:36.369
You played basketball with her,
yet you knew nothing about her?

20:36.369 --> 20:42.489
I'm sorry, Detective, but
outside of these walls, none of
us knew anything about her.

20:48.009 --> 20:50.949
They're lying. All of them.
So let me get this straight.

20:50.949 --> 20:54.109
A man in the Lodge is killed.
Only this man turns out to be a woman

20:54.109 --> 20:58.369
who is somehow connected
to a woman's basketball team
who seem to be hiding something.

20:58.369 --> 21:01.949
And the thing connecting the two of
them is a mystery man with a cane.

21:01.949 --> 21:04.029
With a goatee, sir.

21:04.029 --> 21:06.869
It's complicated, to be sure.
Complicated?

21:06.869 --> 21:08.609
It makes no bloody sense whatsoever!

21:08.609 --> 21:12.369
If these basketball girls
do know something,
let's drag them down the station

21:12.369 --> 21:15.289
and let's scare the living daylights
out of them.

21:15.289 --> 21:18.409
A subtler approach might be more
effective with this, sir.

21:18.409 --> 21:21.289
Perhaps we could send
someone in undercover?

21:21.289 --> 21:23.609
That's a good idea.

21:23.609 --> 21:25.089
But who?

21:28.409 --> 21:29.989
Oh, no, no, no.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.289
I'm not wearing a dress.
Not again, anyway.

21:35.849 --> 21:41.849
Good evening, gentlemen. Detective,
this is all the equipment you should
need for testing toxins in the wine.

21:44.129 --> 21:48.569
Julia, have you ever
played basketball?

21:49.689 --> 21:53.169
As a matter of fact I have.
Why do you ask?

21:53.169 --> 21:55.529
EXCITED SHOUTING

22:12.969 --> 22:16.849
You're very good, Miss Ogden.
When you grow up playing with
country club boys,

22:16.849 --> 22:18.129
you learn a thing or two.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.809
Lucky for us you dropped in.

22:20.809 --> 22:22.269
Back to it!

22:28.704 --> 22:32.204
The Masonic Cipher.
Decoding something, sir?

22:32.204 --> 22:35.384
Yes. And according to her notebook,
so was Grace Read.

22:35.384 --> 22:38.584
She was particularly interested
in these five symbols.

22:38.584 --> 22:41.764
That shouldn't be too difficult.
Five symbols, five letters.

22:41.764 --> 22:44.224
120 permutations, very good, George.

22:44.224 --> 22:46.104
But it's more complicated than that.

22:46.104 --> 22:49.344
For instance,
this symbol could represent a P.

22:49.344 --> 22:54.784
But, depending on its orientation,
it could also be a T, a V

22:54.784 --> 22:56.844
or an N.

22:56.844 --> 22:58.804
So, sir, if each of the five symbols

22:58.804 --> 23:03.944
potentially represent one
in four letters, there must
be thousands of variations.

23:03.944 --> 23:06.804
Over two quintillion, George.

23:08.404 --> 23:11.564
Sir, I think we're going
to need a bigger blackboard.

23:11.564 --> 23:14.924
Julia Ogden,
have I understood you correctly?

23:14.924 --> 23:16.864
You're an unwed doctor living alone.

23:16.864 --> 23:19.264
Yes.

23:19.264 --> 23:21.524
A modern day bachelor girl.

23:21.524 --> 23:23.944
That's the most blissful
thing I've ever heard.

23:23.944 --> 23:29.004
Father would rather see
me married, bored and unhappy
than living a life so free.

23:29.004 --> 23:33.884
He barely tolerates my secretarial
work at the law office.

23:33.884 --> 23:36.884
It was a bit of a battle to get
where I am. But I have no regrets.

23:36.884 --> 23:40.904
And the men with whom you work,
do they think you brazenly improper?

23:40.904 --> 23:42.604
Who knows what men think?

23:42.604 --> 23:44.044
How true.

23:46.924 --> 23:49.944
Julia...

23:49.944 --> 23:53.384
Would you be interested in coming
on a little adventure this evening?

23:53.384 --> 23:56.684
Just a little fun amongst us girls.

24:01.764 --> 24:03.224
Ah!

24:05.924 --> 24:07.864
Not having much luck, sir? No.

24:07.864 --> 24:11.744
I've tested this wine for every
toxin I can think of, and nothing.

24:11.744 --> 24:14.804
How are you doing
with the bottle and cork?

24:14.804 --> 24:19.464
Equally bad luck, sir.
If anybody's interfered with
either of these, I can't see how.

24:19.464 --> 24:21.544
Yet Grace Read was poisoned.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.644
But how and with what?

24:23.644 --> 24:25.944
Sir, Doctor Ogden just
sent this by messenger.

24:28.764 --> 24:31.424
We're to meet her at
The Albany Club on Colborne Street.

24:35.964 --> 24:39.204
Sir, this is a gentlemen's club. Are
you sure Dr Ogden meant the Albany?

24:39.204 --> 24:42.184
That's what Higgins wrote down.

24:42.184 --> 24:43.864
Guests of Dr Ogden's.

24:49.644 --> 24:51.844
What are we looking for, sir?

24:51.844 --> 24:53.304
I have no idea.

25:06.444 --> 25:08.204
Have either of you a light?

25:08.204 --> 25:09.664
Sorry.

25:18.304 --> 25:20.344
Thank you. Not at all.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.124
Julia?

25:25.124 --> 25:27.624
Dr Ogden, you look like a man.

25:27.624 --> 25:29.944
Like a...pretty man.

25:29.944 --> 25:34.464
I had no idea a man's suit
could be so comfortable.

25:34.464 --> 25:37.184
It's delightful not
wearing a corset.

25:37.184 --> 25:39.524
Julia, what on earth are you doing?

25:41.084 --> 25:45.184
You wanted me to find out what
the basketball team was hiding. And?

25:45.184 --> 25:47.284
Look around you.

25:54.344 --> 25:57.124
Look closely, William.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.664
Do you recognise any of
the men in this photograph?

26:10.024 --> 26:12.324
The women's basketball team.

26:12.324 --> 26:14.564
Those are women?

26:14.564 --> 26:16.984
Sir, they're exceedingly convincing.

26:16.984 --> 26:20.424
What are they doing here?
And why dress like that?

26:20.424 --> 26:23.004
It's a sort of club.

26:23.004 --> 26:28.004
They seek experiences that give
them liberties exclusive to men.

26:29.064 --> 26:30.844
Sir. He's there.

26:34.184 --> 26:37.244
It's our man with the cane.

26:45.964 --> 26:47.204
That's enough!

26:55.084 --> 26:56.904
Mrs Winters.

27:07.064 --> 27:10.264
Mrs Winters, if you'll follow me,
please. Where are you taking her?

27:10.264 --> 27:12.824
The rest of you please have a seat.

27:12.824 --> 27:15.124
I have some questions
about Grace Read's murder.

27:15.124 --> 27:20.004
Doctor. Yes, Inspector.
Let's talk in my office, shall we?

27:20.004 --> 27:22.424
You, too, Murdoch. Julia?

27:24.544 --> 27:26.004
You rat.

27:26.004 --> 27:28.244
'Well, it's obvious.'

27:28.244 --> 27:32.564
They either killed Grace Read
or had something to do with it.
In a Mason's Lodge?

27:32.564 --> 27:35.244
I don't see how that's obvious.
But they did lie to me.

27:35.244 --> 27:37.504
They were afraid.

27:37.504 --> 27:42.724
Most of them have husbands,
fathers, even mothers, who would
disown them for doing this.

27:42.724 --> 27:44.324
I don't understand it myself.

27:44.324 --> 27:49.204
The Temperance League,
the Suffrage Association,
feminists... And now this.

27:49.204 --> 27:52.204
Wearing suits as if dressing
like a man will make them one.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.804
They don't want to be men.

27:53.804 --> 27:56.164
They want to be equal.
No, they don't.

27:56.164 --> 27:59.124
They have no idea what it takes to be
a man, and trust me, love,

27:59.124 --> 28:01.384
when I tell you that
they couldn't handle it.

28:05.944 --> 28:08.764
Well, have you
anything to say, William?

28:08.764 --> 28:14.624
Yes. I believe these women are
our best key to finding out
how and why Grace Read died.

28:14.624 --> 28:17.384
We need to speak with them. Right.

28:17.384 --> 28:18.984
Let's get on with it.

28:24.224 --> 28:27.084
Have you no opinion on this matter?

28:27.084 --> 28:31.284
Yes, of course I do.
And yet you just stand there.

28:37.064 --> 28:42.164
Am I in trouble?
Mrs Winters, I need to know
why you were following Grace.

28:42.164 --> 28:46.204
I wasn't.
I saw you in her boarding house.

28:47.884 --> 28:49.984
Only to get the photograph back.

28:49.984 --> 28:52.124
So no-one would discover our secret.

28:52.124 --> 28:55.584
Prior to her death, someone had
been following Grace. Was it you?

28:55.584 --> 28:57.664
No. Not Miriam.

28:57.664 --> 28:59.704
Someone else was following Gracie.

28:59.704 --> 29:01.704
Who? I don't know.

29:01.704 --> 29:04.024
But she was being followed.

29:04.024 --> 29:07.784
And when she was murdered,
we were afraid we might be next.

29:07.784 --> 29:12.824
Is that why, on the night of
her death, you didn't tell us
that Grace was a woman? Yes.

29:12.824 --> 29:15.544
Plus my husband and all
his Brethren were there.

29:15.544 --> 29:17.784
I couldn't risk the social
outrage it might cause.

29:20.764 --> 29:25.704
If dressing as a man is so
outrageous, why were you doing it?

29:29.944 --> 29:32.664
When Leonard introduced me to Victor,

29:32.664 --> 29:35.544
I somehow sensed he was a woman.

29:37.884 --> 29:43.444
He... She...opened the door
to a world I had never known.

29:43.444 --> 29:47.324
We lunched together
and we took long walks.

29:47.324 --> 29:49.444
And the respect
she commanded as a man...

29:50.824 --> 29:54.404
It was so freeing, in a way that...

29:56.644 --> 29:59.924
Well, that you'll never understand.

30:04.084 --> 30:06.464
Were you also planning to
live your life out as a man?

30:06.464 --> 30:08.244
Goodness, no.

30:09.844 --> 30:12.224
Victor was the only one
so serious about it.

30:16.524 --> 30:20.804
Gracie didn't care about
marriage or family life so much as
she wanted to have a career.

30:20.804 --> 30:24.524
But no-one will hire
a female accountant.
So she interviewed as a man.

30:24.524 --> 30:26.624
And she got the job. Yes.

30:26.624 --> 30:30.964
And it was so exhilarating,
being independent.

30:30.964 --> 30:35.564
But then several weeks ago she began
to feel like she was being watched.

30:35.564 --> 30:37.704
At first we thought
she was being paranoid.

30:37.704 --> 30:39.584
Why did she change her mind?

30:39.584 --> 30:42.184
Well, then Miriam saw him, too.

30:47.704 --> 30:52.124
Victor and I were lunching on King
Street when she pointed him out.

30:52.124 --> 30:55.124
Had you seen him before?
No, but I clearly remember his face

30:55.124 --> 30:57.924
because it was right
before her attack.

30:57.924 --> 31:00.404
What attack? It was awful.

31:00.404 --> 31:02.504
Victor took the tiniest bite
of my dessert.

31:02.504 --> 31:08.524
And before I knew what was happening
her face grew red and she lost
her breath for a few moments.

31:08.524 --> 31:11.404
Could the man have put
something in the dessert?

31:11.404 --> 31:13.864
I don't see how.

31:13.864 --> 31:15.484
He arrived after us.

31:15.484 --> 31:18.064
And the bite she took
was from my plate.

31:18.064 --> 31:21.744
There. That's the man I saw.

31:21.744 --> 31:23.544
I demand to see my wife. Miriam!

31:23.544 --> 31:25.364
Leonard!

31:25.364 --> 31:29.324
Detective, may I?
Mrs Winters, just one more question.

31:29.324 --> 31:34.124
Your dessert, the one that
Grace tasted - what was it?

31:34.124 --> 31:37.244
It was vanilla ice cream croquette.

31:37.244 --> 31:41.044
Rolled in crushed peanuts
and macaroons, I believe.

31:42.724 --> 31:44.184
I see. Thank you.

31:56.224 --> 32:00.484
Miriam? What in the world is
going on here? Who are these people?

32:00.484 --> 32:02.324
Why are you dressed like that?

32:02.324 --> 32:06.484
Leonard, please don't be angry. These
are my friends. What kind of friends?

32:06.484 --> 32:09.204
Well, it's a club of sorts.
Victor introduced me.

32:09.204 --> 32:13.024
And you kept it from me? Victor's
true nature, this secret club...

32:13.024 --> 32:15.044
Yes, Leonard, a secret club.

32:15.044 --> 32:21.704
Just like your secret Masons' club
and your secret gentlemen's club
and your secret country club.

32:21.704 --> 32:23.244
Miriam, please.

32:24.864 --> 32:28.004
I never meant to keep
anything from you.

32:28.004 --> 32:30.984
Nor I.

32:30.984 --> 32:34.844
Leonard, please take me home.

32:34.844 --> 32:38.524
This is our mystery man.
Do either of you recognise him?

32:38.524 --> 32:42.044
No. Crabtree? No, sir. We should
show this to our fellow Brethren.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.364
I'll call an emergency meeting.

32:44.364 --> 32:48.004
Where's Dr Ogden? I need her help in
testing something. Another poison?

32:48.004 --> 32:50.124
Not quite.

32:50.124 --> 32:52.344
Peanuts?

32:52.344 --> 32:54.904
You think this she-man
died from peanut poisoning?

32:54.904 --> 32:57.564
It's a possibility.
I can't think what else it would be.

32:57.564 --> 32:59.684
Ice cream and macaroons
seem even less likely.

32:59.684 --> 33:02.664
So death by peanut is
what you're proposing.

33:02.664 --> 33:04.324
It would be exceedingly rare.

33:04.324 --> 33:09.344
However I have read material
that supports theories of
hypersensitivity to food.

33:09.344 --> 33:13.044
Peanuts are rare enough.
To be sensitive to them seems
highly unlikely.

33:13.044 --> 33:17.384
Well, there are no traces of
peanut protein in the wine.

33:17.384 --> 33:18.464
There you go.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.084
Unless...

33:20.084 --> 33:23.264
Unless we're testing
the wrong piece of evidence.

33:23.264 --> 33:27.544
What if the killer
ground the peanuts into a fine,
liquid, soluble paste,

33:27.544 --> 33:31.424
spread it in the skull, then, when
the wine was poured into the skull,

33:31.424 --> 33:35.104
it would have mixed with the
peanuts, becoming lethal to Grace.

33:35.104 --> 33:39.564
It's possible.
This mystery man could easily have
learned of Grace Read's sensitivity

33:39.564 --> 33:44.644
to peanuts from the attack she had
while lunching with Miriam Winters.
Exactly.

33:44.644 --> 33:46.844
Detective - a word?

33:53.884 --> 33:57.244
What is it, George? Sir, I had
Higgins look into Elias Boswell.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.404
He has not one but
three bank accounts.

33:59.404 --> 34:03.804
He also has a safety deposit box
which he accessed after almost
every Masonic charity event.

34:03.804 --> 34:05.844
So he WAS skimming
funds from the Lodge?

34:05.844 --> 34:10.344
Yes, and not just for himself.
He has a woman of...loose character
that he keeps on the side.

34:10.344 --> 34:13.344
Pays for her apartment. Detective!

34:13.344 --> 34:15.184
Oh, and sir - your copies.

34:15.184 --> 34:16.664
Thank you, George. Good work.

34:18.284 --> 34:22.643
There is peanut residue
in the skull. Gentlemen, this is
your murder weapon.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.524
A murder weapon that was
kept exclusively at the Lodge.

34:25.524 --> 34:29.484
So now we have a Mason who had
access to the skull,

34:29.484 --> 34:32.384
and a killer who knew of Grace
Read's sensitivity to peanuts.

34:32.384 --> 34:34.464
Let's hope someone recognises him.

34:34.464 --> 34:36.123
I've never seen him. Nor I.

34:36.123 --> 34:41.164
Please look closely, Brothers. This
could be Victor Bernard's killer.

34:44.744 --> 34:47.844
Is that...? Yes, it is.

34:47.844 --> 34:51.384
And if I remember the layout of
the second floor correctly,

34:51.384 --> 34:54.744
that's coming from The Hiram Room.

35:01.684 --> 35:07.184
The morality of our Temple has been
tested. The Great Architect of the
Universe's vengeance is upon us.

35:07.184 --> 35:08.804
Anderson, shut up.

35:08.804 --> 35:11.064
Gentlemen, please step back.

35:16.284 --> 35:19.224
Isn't that the man that
was following Grace Read?

35:19.224 --> 35:22.404
Yes, sir. I believe it is.
So that's our killer?

35:22.404 --> 35:24.204
It seems so.

35:33.511 --> 35:36.511
According to this,
his name is Francis LaChapelle.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.251
He's a private investigator.

35:38.251 --> 35:42.911
Maybe he was following Grace at
the behest of the killer. Possibly.

35:42.911 --> 35:47.891
George, find his office
and go through it with
a fine-toothed comb. Sir.

35:47.891 --> 35:49.831
Constable.

35:49.831 --> 35:51.691
Charming to be back here again.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.931
Doctor. We found
the mace beside the body.

35:53.931 --> 35:56.511
I assume it to be the murder weapon.

35:59.431 --> 36:02.831
That would be consistent
with a blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

36:02.831 --> 36:05.111
There's minimal blood spatter.

36:05.111 --> 36:08.771
It appears it only took
one blow to kill him.

36:08.771 --> 36:12.931
For a religious order, this Temple
certainly has its share of problems.

36:12.931 --> 36:14.391
It's not a religion, Doctor.

36:16.131 --> 36:18.551
A set of beliefs embraced
with ardour and devotion.

36:18.551 --> 36:22.951
Actually, sir,
by definition it is. Murdoch,
don't be such a smart-arse. Sir.

36:24.491 --> 36:28.311
Sir, the door was locked
before we came in, was it not?

36:28.311 --> 36:31.471
I know what you're thinking. Only
one man had access to the room.

36:31.471 --> 36:33.191
The man who let us in.

36:36.219 --> 36:38.099
Grace Read was onto you, wasn't she?

36:38.099 --> 36:41.239
She was sniffing around.
Asking questions she shouldn't have.

36:41.239 --> 36:43.299
But she didn't find anything.

36:43.299 --> 36:46.559
The accounting book is kept
in The Hiram Room, as always.

36:46.559 --> 36:49.159
This Victor, this Grace woman,
never saw it.

36:49.159 --> 36:52.299
Apparently she did.
And you knew that.

36:52.299 --> 36:54.099
So you put LaChapelle on the case.

36:54.099 --> 36:57.399
And the two of you
killed her in the Lodge.

37:00.959 --> 37:06.959
I've never heard of this LaChapelle.
LaChapelle was the only one who knew
about your involvement in the murder.

37:06.959 --> 37:11.159
So you got rid of him, too.
Listen to me.

37:12.939 --> 37:17.779
I'll admit that I've been skimming
funds from the charity fundraiser.

37:17.779 --> 37:20.339
But someone else killed
that man in The Hiram Room.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.579
How did they get inside?

37:22.579 --> 37:26.139
You were the only member
present with access to that room.

37:26.139 --> 37:30.699
That's what we tell everyone.
But anyone can get in if
they know where to look.

37:32.099 --> 37:37.559
Brother Brackenreid, I swear it.
I swear it on the name of the Great
Architect of the Universe.

37:40.279 --> 37:42.539
Great Architect of the Universe.

37:46.879 --> 37:50.339
The code to the combination.

37:50.339 --> 37:54.499
It's written on the floor of
the Great Room. In Masonic Cipher.

37:54.499 --> 37:58.559
G-A-O-T-U. It's an acronym -
Great Architect of the Universe.

37:58.559 --> 38:02.579
Grace Read broke the code. And the
code is the key to the combination.

38:02.579 --> 38:07.479
Yes. Not much of a secret code
if you ask me.

38:07.479 --> 38:11.179
If Grace Read figured out
how to get in, anybody could have.
Including Anderson.

38:11.179 --> 38:15.099
Perhaps he suspected
she was a woman, had LaChapelle
confirm it, then killed her.

38:15.099 --> 38:18.739
Then what? Killed LaChapelle
for blackmail? We're going round
in circles.

38:20.699 --> 38:23.259
Ah, very good, George.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.899
Is this everything from
LaChapelle's office?

38:25.899 --> 38:28.039
Yes, sir. Someone had
definitely been there, sir.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.919
His filing cabinet
had been rifled through.

38:29.919 --> 38:35.679
So if there was anything indicating
LaChapelle had been investigating
Victor... It was likely stolen.

38:35.679 --> 38:39.419
However, sir, these slides -
I found those buried deep
in another cabinet.

38:51.259 --> 38:53.559
Take a look at this, George.

38:53.559 --> 38:57.899
Sir, it looks like Victor, and he's
- she's - sitting with someone.

38:57.899 --> 39:00.219
Let's find out who, shall we?

39:24.279 --> 39:28.179
Sir, it's Grace Read
and Miriam Winters.

39:28.179 --> 39:31.459
No, George. It's Victor and Miriam.

39:31.459 --> 39:34.279
I believe I know who
murdered Grace Read.

39:34.279 --> 39:39.719
Now all we have to do
is trap the killer.

39:39.719 --> 39:43.539
What exactly do you mean
when you say you want to break
into The Hiram Room?

39:43.539 --> 39:47.879
It's embarrassing,
but the Room had been locked before
key evidence was collected.

39:47.879 --> 39:52.219
Brother Boswell is keeping
the combination close to his chest.
What key piece of evidence?

39:52.219 --> 39:54.239
The murder weapon.

39:54.239 --> 39:57.339
Can you not force Boswell's hand?

39:57.339 --> 40:02.099
It would be blasphemous to smash
one's way into any room at The Lodge,
never mind The Hiram Room.

40:02.099 --> 40:04.839
When were you planning this?
Sometime tomorrow.

40:04.839 --> 40:07.519
I can see the Constabulary's
dilemma.

40:07.519 --> 40:13.259
I don't like this one little bit.
Brother Anderson, it would
help us catch a killer. Fine.

40:13.259 --> 40:16.599
Permission granted, if you must.

40:25.839 --> 40:27.959
Mr Winters,

40:27.959 --> 40:29.579
you are under arrest.

40:35.819 --> 40:38.399
How did you know?
This photograph gave it away.

40:38.399 --> 40:43.339
Anyone looking at this picture
would think these two were lovers.
You did, didn't you?

40:43.339 --> 40:45.379
Yes.

40:45.379 --> 40:48.479
Miriam and I were closer
than any two people could be.

40:48.479 --> 40:52.099
Then she started spending
so much time with that man.

40:52.099 --> 40:54.919
That's when you hired LaChapelle
to follow Miriam.

40:54.919 --> 40:59.039
But he mistook their friendship
as well, and your worst fears
were confirmed.

40:59.039 --> 41:02.939
You learned of Victor's
sensitivity to peanuts,
which led to poisoning the skull.

41:02.939 --> 41:06.539
Then you learned
that she was a woman. Yes.

41:06.539 --> 41:10.819
LaChapelle suspected you of killing
Victor, so you killed him as well.

41:10.819 --> 41:12.679
I'm so sorry.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.899
But why kill
LaChapelle in the Lodge?

41:14.899 --> 41:17.119
He was blackmailing me.

41:17.119 --> 41:20.859
I didn't have the money, but
the Lodge did. In The Hiram Room.

41:20.859 --> 41:27.019
How very ironic, sir, since
this all began with your concerns
over Lodge finances.

41:27.019 --> 41:29.879
I could do without the irony.

41:29.879 --> 41:32.459
Leonard? Where is he? Leonard?

41:39.859 --> 41:45.739
I can't see her now. I can't see her
face when she learns what I've done.

41:45.739 --> 41:48.619
I will speak with her.

41:48.619 --> 41:50.059
Sit down, Leonard.

41:56.159 --> 42:00.619
Leonard believed that Victor and I
were intimately involved?

42:00.619 --> 42:03.779
He had no idea at the time
that Victor was a woman.

42:07.899 --> 42:09.579
I never should have kept that secret.

42:11.199 --> 42:12.919
But then he never
should have doubted me.

42:14.499 --> 42:16.619
Unfortunately,
his jealousy overcame him.

42:18.759 --> 42:23.019
So because of jealousy,
I've lost both the love
of my life and my best friend?

42:25.059 --> 42:27.479
I'm terribly sorry.

42:27.479 --> 42:35.319
Leonard once told me that the biggest
difference between men and women
was that men can keep a cool head.

42:36.859 --> 42:38.519
Women cannot.

42:40.639 --> 42:42.419
What do you make of that?

42:46.199 --> 42:48.019
I guess he was wrong.

42:54.439 --> 42:56.919
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ON RECORD

43:05.319 --> 43:08.859
Am I interrupting?
No. Just catching up on my reading.

43:08.859 --> 43:13.059
I'm quite interested in
this hypersensitivities to food.

43:13.059 --> 43:17.099
Obviously, to some people,
the peanut can be extremely harmful.

43:17.099 --> 43:18.779
Fascinating.

43:24.939 --> 43:27.419
Is there something you need?

43:27.419 --> 43:29.339
Yes.

43:29.339 --> 43:31.339
I made you angry earlier.

43:31.339 --> 43:35.259
Yes. I don't know why.

43:38.299 --> 43:42.539
The Inspector was being
archaic and thick-headed,
and you just stood there.

43:44.099 --> 43:47.139
Julia, that was your argument.

43:47.139 --> 43:52.599
And for me to jump in as though
you aren't strong enough to
handle yourself in the situation

43:52.599 --> 43:54.399
somewhat defeats that argument.

43:57.279 --> 43:59.259
I only wanted your support.

43:59.259 --> 44:03.199
And you have it. Completely.

44:03.199 --> 44:05.699
But I will not rescue you, Julia.

44:05.699 --> 44:10.519
Because from everything I know
about you, you don't need it.

44:16.619 --> 44:18.099
Your logic is infuriating.

44:21.019 --> 44:23.639
Not just a little bit winsome?

44:27.659 --> 44:32.439
Perhaps a little. Good.

44:32.439 --> 44:37.619
Now, would you like to tell me
more about these food sensitivities?

44:37.619 --> 44:40.619
Yes.

44:40.619 --> 44:42.779
But first,

44:42.779 --> 44:44.759
I want you to kiss me.

44:44.759 --> 44:46.359
Like a man.

44:46.359 --> 44:49.219
