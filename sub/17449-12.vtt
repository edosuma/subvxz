WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:04.458
So Stefanie just texted me to say

00:05.458 --> 00:09.834
"I will never, ever,
ever, ever date you. Ever."

00:10.959 --> 00:13.458
I didn't even ask her out.
She just wanted to remind me.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.166
(cell phone chimes)

00:16.250 --> 00:17.709
A text from Stefanie.

00:17.792 --> 00:20.667
"I will never, ever, ever date Kaz ever."

00:21.291 --> 00:22.291
Please show this to Kaz.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.000
I wish I could find a pretty girl

00:28.083 --> 00:29.834
who knows that I work at Mighty Med

00:29.917 --> 00:31.250
so she'd know how cool I am.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.792
I told you, I'm fine.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.750
Nightstrike barely scratched me.

00:40.417 --> 00:43.250
It's Spark,
the girl who was born with superpowers

00:43.333 --> 00:45.959
after her mom,
an astronaut who was pregnant,

00:46.041 --> 00:48.792
was hit with gamma rays
while orbiting Mars.

00:48.875 --> 00:50.959
Why couldn't my mom
expose herself to gamma rays

00:51.041 --> 00:52.417
when she was pregnant?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.250
She wouldn't even eat sushi.

00:55.458 --> 00:56.750
Thanks for nothing, Mom.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.083
I said I'm fine!

01:04.375 --> 01:06.291
Spark is so awesome.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.959
I'm gonna go ask her out.

01:09.041 --> 01:11.208
No, you've never even met her.

01:11.291 --> 01:13.583
You can't just ask out a superhero.

01:13.667 --> 01:15.083
You have to become friends first,

01:15.166 --> 01:17.709
and then gradually transition
into something more.

01:17.792 --> 01:21.083
Trust me, I know everything
about being in love with a superhero.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.542
Yeah, except how to get
her to love you back.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.959
Yes, that part is harder.

01:27.792 --> 01:28.709
I'm just gonna go for it.

01:28.792 --> 01:31.709
I've already thought
of a brilliant line if she says no.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.959
I'll just say, "Who cares what you think?"

01:34.041 --> 01:36.083
That doesn't seem all that brilliant.

01:36.166 --> 01:37.500
Who cares what you think?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.125
Hey, girl, wanna go out with me?

01:49.208 --> 01:51.250
-I'd love to.
-Who cares what you--

01:51.333 --> 01:52.667
Wait, what?

01:53.667 --> 01:57.208
Yeah. Boys are always
too intimidated to ask me out.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.500
They usually wanna become friends first,

01:59.583 --> 02:01.583
then slowly transition
into something more.

02:02.875 --> 02:04.208
That's just stupid.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.792
I know.

02:06.875 --> 02:08.166
(scoffs)

02:08.250 --> 02:10.834
So, uh, when should I pick you up?

02:10.917 --> 02:13.291
I don't know. Maybe I'll pick you up.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.500

I'm so excited about our first date.

03:08.834 --> 03:12.041
Me, too. And I have
the perfect place to eat.

03:12.125 --> 03:15.000
You know that fancy restaurant
down on 5th Street?

03:15.083 --> 03:16.792
Sometimes, at the end of the night,

03:16.875 --> 03:18.333
they throw away their food.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.542
I can fly, remember?

03:22.625 --> 03:24.166
We can go anywhere.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.375
And I know exactly what we should do.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.291
Picnic on a cloud.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.291
This is incredible.
How am I staying up here?

03:34.375 --> 03:37.250
You're fine, as long as you hold my hand.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.834
(yells)

03:41.834 --> 03:42.709
Just kidding.

03:44.333 --> 03:47.959
I'm creating an anti-gravity field
all around us.

03:48.041 --> 03:50.792
So don't eat anything too heavy.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.000
Thank you for doing all this.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.709
I'd say I'm on cloud nine,

03:57.792 --> 04:00.291
but I don't really know
how many clouds there are,

04:00.375 --> 04:01.917
or what the numbering system is.

04:03.083 --> 04:07.000
Kaz, I'm having such a great time.

04:07.083 --> 04:09.750
I was nervous because
I haven't really dated very much.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.709
The truth is,
I've never had a real boyfriend.

04:12.792 --> 04:14.917
What? How is that possible?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.750
Even my sister has a boyfriend,

04:16.834 --> 04:18.291
and she looks like Shrek.

04:19.417 --> 04:20.917
(cell phone rings)

04:21.000 --> 04:22.333
Excuse me.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.041
Hello.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.333
Oh, yeah, I'm...

04:26.417 --> 04:27.834
nowhere special.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.709
Just with a... friend.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.792
Yeah, dinner at 7:00. Yeah, I'll be--

04:34.875 --> 04:36.500
Who are you talking to?

04:36.583 --> 04:37.792
You have another girlfriend,

04:37.875 --> 04:40.625
and you're going to dinner
with her after our date?

04:41.625 --> 04:43.375
(yells) My phone!

04:44.208 --> 04:46.542
No! Must have internet at all times.

04:49.667 --> 04:53.125
Who is that boyfriend-stealing floozy?

04:53.208 --> 04:55.500
I'll rip her face right off her head!

04:57.166 --> 05:00.166
That boyfriend-stealing floozy
was my mother,

05:00.250 --> 05:03.291
telling me to be home for dinner by 7:00.

05:05.208 --> 05:06.208
Oops.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.000
Sorry. My mistake.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.834
Anyway...

05:12.917 --> 05:14.375
what were we talking about?

05:14.458 --> 05:16.959
Why you've never had a boyfriend before.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.417
Oh, yeah.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.333
I have no idea why.

05:21.417 --> 05:24.000
I think it's because
I'm not aggressive enough.

05:30.792 --> 05:31.750
Hey, Horace.

05:31.834 --> 05:33.750
Can I make a suggestion?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.834
I've already tried
all the dandruff shampoos,

05:36.917 --> 05:38.000
thank you very much.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.792
No, I was thinking

05:42.875 --> 05:44.583
maybe we should increase
the security here,

05:44.667 --> 05:46.792
given all the recent villain break-ins.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.417
Oh, please. Mighty Med is perfectly safe.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.667
We already have
foolproof measures in place.

05:51.750 --> 05:52.875
See.

05:57.041 --> 05:58.166
Forget the sign.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.166
Don't you think we should replace

06:00.250 --> 06:03.000
the broken security bots
and get better guards?

06:03.083 --> 06:05.333
The ones we have are a bunch of dummies.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.834
Are you talking about me or him?

06:09.667 --> 06:13.041
(laughs) You mean Henderson.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.250
He's just filling in for Jenkins,

06:15.333 --> 06:16.875
who's also a mannequin.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.834
Look, I'll prove it to you.

06:19.917 --> 06:21.625
I'll try to break in to the hospital,

06:21.709 --> 06:22.917
and you try and keep me out.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.959
And if you can't, then you have to let me

06:26.041 --> 06:27.542
implement new security measures.

06:27.625 --> 06:28.834
Oh, you're on.

06:28.917 --> 06:30.750
There is no way you're getting in here,

06:30.834 --> 06:33.041
because I have the utmost confidence
in my team.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.291
Right, fellas?

06:38.291 --> 06:41.625
Another reason
I deserve to make more than him.

06:47.458 --> 06:49.834
Hey, Kaz, how was the big date?

06:49.917 --> 06:51.375
It was a nightmare.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.625
(quietly) Spark
is completely crazy and jealous.

06:54.542 --> 06:55.625
Why are you whispering?

06:55.709 --> 06:58.083
You try dating a girl
who has super hearing

06:58.166 --> 06:59.875
and can fly at the speed of light.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.166
I can't talk right now.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.834
(screams)

07:07.208 --> 07:08.667
Why can't you talk right now?

07:08.750 --> 07:10.000
Uh...

07:10.834 --> 07:13.959
because I'm too busy talking to you.

07:15.542 --> 07:16.709
Aw!

07:17.250 --> 07:18.792
Did you see I decorated your locker?

07:24.500 --> 07:26.250
(nervous laughter) Pretty.

07:27.834 --> 07:28.792
See ya later.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.709
Aw, how sweet.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.375
You're blown away by me.

07:40.834 --> 07:44.250
I've got to figure out a way
to get out of this relationship.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.458
Just break up with her.

07:45.542 --> 07:47.500
I mean, I'm sure she'll be crushed--

07:47.583 --> 07:49.291
No, I'll be crushed.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.208
She said if I ever broke up with her,

07:51.291 --> 07:54.083
she'd crush my bones
and use them as bath salts.

07:56.333 --> 07:59.458
Sounds simultaneously
violent and relaxing.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.834
Wait. I have an idea.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.875
She can't hurt me if I'm already dead.

08:06.959 --> 08:09.375
So I'll just fake my own death.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.959
Why is that always your first suggestion?

08:14.291 --> 08:17.750
You said the same thing when your father
wanted you to mow the lawn.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.125
I'm serious.
All we have to do is fake my own death,

08:21.208 --> 08:22.583
then I'll lay low for a few weeks,

08:22.667 --> 08:24.834
and hopefully,
I'll never have to see her again.

08:24.917 --> 08:26.458
But I'll need your help.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.000
Forget it. This is crazy.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.834
I'm not gonna help
you lie to her like this.

08:29.917 --> 08:33.250
Well, if you don't help me,
then I'll just tell everybody at school

08:33.333 --> 08:35.291
about your fear
of falling airplane toilets.

08:41.667 --> 08:45.542
All right. Thank you all
for coming to "Kaz' funeral."

08:45.625 --> 08:48.041
Of course,
you all know why I use finger quotes.

08:48.125 --> 08:51.333
Yeah, we get it.
Your fingers are flexible.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.041
Well, so are mine.

08:56.917 --> 08:59.083
Come on, boys, we practiced this.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.709
Ooh, pizza!

09:10.792 --> 09:13.208
Wait. I didn't order any pizza.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.959
Then again,
maybe I did and I forgot about it.

09:16.041 --> 09:19.166
When I'm hungry,
I sometimes have short-term memory loss.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.083
Ooh, pizza...
Wait, I didn't order any pizza.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.667
Guards, make sure he's clean.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.166
I got this one.

09:30.250 --> 09:31.834
(sniffing)

09:33.041 --> 09:34.333
He's clean.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.333
What kind of soap do you use?
Do I smell sandalwood?

09:39.166 --> 09:40.750
Okay, fine.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.083
-Ha!
-(screams)

09:46.834 --> 09:47.792
I got you.

09:47.875 --> 09:48.834
Wait.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.500
So there's no pizza?

09:53.250 --> 09:56.166
Look how easily someone can sneak in here.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.667
I could've had a bomb.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.375
Or pizza.

10:00.709 --> 10:03.208
All right, Skylar, you proved your point.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.333
I'm putting you in charge
of improving security.

10:06.417 --> 10:09.417
Great. You'll see some real
changes around here.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.208
You guys mind if I take these boxes?

10:11.291 --> 10:13.458
I'm looking for a new place to live.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.917
My current roommate
just lies awake at night

10:17.000 --> 10:20.333
staring at me.
It's really creepy, Henderson.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.208
Oliver, I got your message.

10:27.291 --> 10:28.959
I can't believe Kaz is gone.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.000
What happened?

10:30.083 --> 10:31.458
(crying)

10:33.000 --> 10:36.291
He was trying to save
a bus full of... puppies...

10:37.875 --> 10:39.792
that swerved off a bridge.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.667
I blame the bus company.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.959
That's what they get
for letting puppies drive a bus.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.291
I mean, full-grown dogs, sure,

10:47.375 --> 10:50.083
but puppies don't have the attention span.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.750
I just wish I could've done
something to prevent it.

10:56.583 --> 10:59.417
Thank you for having
this memorial service, Oliver.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.917
The least I could do for my best friend

11:02.000 --> 11:05.333
is host this poorly catered,
sparsely attended memorial service.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.834
No kidding. Where is everybody?

11:09.917 --> 11:12.375
See if I come
to any of your fake memorials.

11:17.083 --> 11:18.333
What are you watching?

11:18.417 --> 11:19.875
My own funeral.

11:22.166 --> 11:25.875
See, I was afraid to break up
with my superhero girlfriend

11:25.959 --> 11:29.083
because I thought she'd destroy me,
so I'm pretending to be dead.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.834
This is a terrible idea.

11:32.917 --> 11:35.542
It's in poor taste,
and it can only end badly.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.625
Well, I think it's a brilliant idea,

11:38.709 --> 11:41.625
is in fine taste, and can only end goodly.

11:42.542 --> 11:44.750
Okay. It's your funeral.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.750
This is boring.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.625
Isn't there another funeral we can watch?

11:54.417 --> 11:55.667
I'm changing the channel.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.083
-Stop it.
-(beeps)

12:01.875 --> 12:04.041
It's my funeral, and I wanna watch it.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.166
Uh...

12:08.250 --> 12:09.542
Amazing.

12:09.625 --> 12:13.083
Kaz must've pre-recorded
a final good-bye message

12:13.166 --> 12:16.208
for his friends. Look at him.
It's almost as if he's still with us,

12:16.291 --> 12:18.333
and I could call out to him

12:18.417 --> 12:21.291
and say, "Kaz, I can see you right now

12:21.375 --> 12:23.709
on the monitor in the Domain."

12:29.959 --> 12:33.291
If I seem to be at a loss for words,

12:33.375 --> 12:34.959
it's because I'm dead.

12:36.333 --> 12:39.333
Okay, service is over. Everyone out.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.333
Because this is just too painful.

12:44.542 --> 12:46.709
Especially for his beloved girlfriend...

12:49.500 --> 12:50.834
Where'd she go?

12:51.458 --> 12:52.709
Oh, no.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.709
-Kaz.
-Oh.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.417
Hey, there you are, Oliver.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.125
Thank you for warning me.

13:00.208 --> 13:02.792
Hope that psycho Spark bought it.

13:02.875 --> 13:03.875
Um, Kaz.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.625
You might wanna turn around.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.875
(both scream)

13:10.375 --> 13:11.959
Hey.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.458
I was just talking about you.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.625
I cannot believe you!

13:22.709 --> 13:24.250
You faked your own death

13:24.333 --> 13:26.667
because you didn't want
to spend time with me?

13:26.750 --> 13:30.417
Okay, ordinarily, I would try
to lie my way out of this,

13:30.500 --> 13:32.041
but I'm just gonna tell the truth.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.917
I'm a ghost. Oooh.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.125
You two look like
you need to be left alone,

13:41.208 --> 13:44.250
because it's better
if there are no witnesses.

13:50.875 --> 13:51.875
(grunts)

13:54.458 --> 13:56.500
(cries)

13:57.208 --> 13:59.667
I thought you liked me.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.250
I can't believe I was so stupid.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.542
Good going, Kaz.

14:06.625 --> 14:09.250
We're supposed to save superheroes,
not hurt them.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.875
Hope you're happy.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.417
Not really.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.083
She didn't cry at all
when she thought I was dead.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.291
What the heck?

14:23.792 --> 14:27.792
Horace, I've already taken several steps
to better secure the hospital.

14:27.875 --> 14:28.875
So have I.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.083
Anyway...

14:36.041 --> 14:38.709
Our computers
contain top-secret information

14:38.792 --> 14:41.125
that villains would literally kill for.

14:41.208 --> 14:44.834
So logging in will now
require a 75-character password.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.000
If anyone enters the wrong password,

14:47.083 --> 14:48.458
a defense system is armed.

14:48.542 --> 14:49.834
That's weird.

14:49.917 --> 14:51.834
My password won't work--

14:51.917 --> 14:54.041
-(shrieks)
-(alarm buzzes)

14:54.834 --> 14:57.041
Henderson, are you just gonna stand there?

14:57.125 --> 14:57.959
Help him!

15:00.250 --> 15:02.375
Next, I figured out a way

15:02.458 --> 15:05.417
to prevent villains from stealing
our weapons and technology.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.333
If any of our equipment
is touched by anyone

15:08.417 --> 15:11.625
whose fingerprints have not
been authorized, an alarm is triggered.

15:14.333 --> 15:17.333
Hey, why won't this thing turn on?

15:17.417 --> 15:18.625
(alarm sounds)

15:21.083 --> 15:23.709
(shrieks)

15:25.917 --> 15:28.542
Oh, whew. That was close.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.709
Kaz, what makes you think
that Spark came here?

15:39.792 --> 15:42.125
I just followed the trail
of crumpled-up tissues.

15:52.625 --> 15:55.208
Spark, I'm surprised
you're back on your feet

15:55.291 --> 15:56.875
after our last battle.

15:56.959 --> 15:58.583
You're tougher than I realized.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.041
(weeping)

16:06.000 --> 16:07.750
What are you doing?

16:07.834 --> 16:09.875
My boyfriend dumped me.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.291
This is great.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.959
I can't attack you while you're crying.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.125
Everyone will think I'm a total jerk.

16:16.208 --> 16:20.875
Why did he dump me? Why?

16:22.875 --> 16:26.291
Look, I'll give you a minute
to pull yourself together.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.166
But then, I'm gonna have to destroy you,

16:28.250 --> 16:30.250
because I've already told
people I was coming.

16:34.583 --> 16:37.083
Kaz, you have to somehow
make her feel better,

16:37.166 --> 16:39.000
or she's gonna get
destroyed by Nightstrike.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.875
You know,
I just got out of a serious relationship,

16:41.959 --> 16:44.709
and I don't hear anyone
asking about my feelings.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.792
Nightstrike, do you mind if I...

16:51.875 --> 16:52.959
Please.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.041
Spark, this is all my fault.

16:58.125 --> 17:01.583
I never should've asked you out.
I wasn't ready for a relationship.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.166
But in my defense,

17:03.250 --> 17:05.417
I had no idea how crazy you were.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.667
That's who you're crying over?

17:11.750 --> 17:13.583
What is wrong with you?

17:14.875 --> 17:18.000
Spark, you have 30 seconds.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.709
Spark, listen to me.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.208
You're amazing.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.917
You're beautiful and brave,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.041
and an incredible hero.

17:27.125 --> 17:30.583
You deserve someone
who will respect you, not hurt you.

17:30.667 --> 17:34.083
You deserve someone
who'll make you laugh, not cry.

17:34.166 --> 17:37.875
You deserve someone who'll love you
for the treasure you are.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.125
You're right.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.417
Thanks, Oliver.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.083
All right, Nightstrike.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.875
Now it's your turn to cry.

18:34.750 --> 18:37.333
Surrender,
or the not-so pretty boy gets it.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.709
Watch out, Oliver.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.750
Oh, me.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.959
You really think I wanna keep him around?

18:49.291 --> 18:51.041
Kaz broke my heart.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.667
Spark, you were incredible.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.333
Thanks.

19:03.417 --> 19:04.458
And you're right.

19:04.542 --> 19:07.166
I do deserve someone better than Kaz.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.250
Someone like you.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.417
What?

19:12.208 --> 19:15.458
I agree.
Oliver would make a great boyfriend.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.166
I would date him right now if I could,

19:17.250 --> 19:20.417
but I can't,
'cause I just got out of a relationship.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.333
(laughs)

19:24.417 --> 19:25.917
Relax. I'm just kidding.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.875
I would never date you, Oliver.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.166
I may be unstable, but I'm not desperate.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.041
Who cares what you think?

19:41.000 --> 19:44.417
Horace, you are going to love
my next security feature.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.333
Let's say a villain
somehow manages to get past

19:47.417 --> 19:49.583
the electrified fence
and the bottomless pit

19:49.667 --> 19:51.709
that I've installed
in the janitor's closet.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.875
They'll still need to get past this.

19:57.834 --> 20:01.208
A laser grid
that will set off deadly booby traps

20:01.291 --> 20:03.000
for any villain who triggers it.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.250
(shrieks)

20:10.542 --> 20:11.959
Skylar, I've seen enough.

20:12.041 --> 20:16.500
Turn this thing off before a staff member
we actually care about gets hurt.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.125
You have gone completely overboard

20:21.208 --> 20:23.333
with these security measures.
What were you thinking?

20:23.417 --> 20:25.041
I'm sorry, it's just...

20:25.125 --> 20:27.667
When the Annihilator
broke in and turned me evil,

20:27.750 --> 20:29.959
I almost hurt a lot of people I love,

20:30.041 --> 20:31.333
and Alan.

20:32.959 --> 20:35.750
I figured if I could keep Mighty Med safe,

20:35.834 --> 20:38.709
then I'd never be able
to hurt anyone again.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.083
I understand, Skylar.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.166
Why don't we work together

20:44.250 --> 20:47.000
and come up with a security system
that works for everyone?

20:47.667 --> 20:48.959
I'll get you a tissue.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.917
(alarm sounds)

21:00.166 --> 21:02.625
Why would you put an alarm on that?

21:02.709 --> 21:05.333
The weird thing is, I didn't.

21:05.417 --> 21:06.667
Then who did?

21:18.083 --> 21:20.667
(theme music plays)

21:42.083 --> 21:43.333
(boing)

21:47.166 --> 21:48.083
(boy) Yes!
