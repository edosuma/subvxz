00:12.720 --> 00:14.280
[narrator] How did it get to this?

00:14.360 --> 00:18.320
That's the question we often ask ourselves
after things have become so bad,

00:18.360 --> 00:21.840
so fucked up that the only solution,
like, the only cure,

00:21.920 --> 00:24.480
seems to be simply to run away somewhere,

00:24.560 --> 00:27.560
start again from scratch,
just leave everything behind.

00:31.120 --> 00:34.200
See, but the truth is often times
it isn't just one definitive action

00:34.280 --> 00:36.840
or choice that brings us to disaster
in the first place.

00:37.920 --> 00:38.960
Nah.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.960
Nah, see,
it's more like a series of events,

00:43.040 --> 00:45.560
like, bad choices, poor decisions even,

00:45.640 --> 00:48.120
that end up leading us deeper and deeper,

00:48.200 --> 00:51.920
further and further
down the rabbit hole we go.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.520
Going... gone.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.080
[foreboding trap music]

01:22.360 --> 01:24.200
Have you even slept?

01:26.800 --> 01:29.480
Nah, not really, maybe,
like, half an hour or summin'.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.640

01:52.280 --> 01:54.480
I can't believe things
have gotten this bad.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.160
I don't know what to do.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.160
Look, I'm just trying to see this
as a new start for us, you know?

02:05.200 --> 02:07.440
I just want to turn this into
summin' positive, we have to.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.720
'Cause we can't stay here anymore,
you understand?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.440
Well, what about my mum?

02:14.520 --> 02:16.960
My... brother, my sisters?

02:17.040 --> 02:18.800
I... I don't get to see them?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.280
Like, they won't even be there
when our baby's born.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.160
[sighs]

02:31.160 --> 02:32.520
Was it all worth it?

02:34.840 --> 02:36.440
All of this?

02:37.960 --> 02:40.080
Was it all worth it, Gogo?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.440
Look, babe...

02:52.080 --> 02:53.840
I don't even know what to say.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.560
Look, I know I did it again.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.040
Yeah, I fucked up.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.200
Yeah, I fucked up again.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.840
Like, I know, I get it.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.920
And look, I know
I haven't been the ideal man or...

03:12.000 --> 03:14.360
or perfect boyfriend either
for you, like...

03:19.360 --> 03:21.480
Look, you blatantly deserve better,
alright?

03:23.240 --> 03:24.600
That much is obvious.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.840
[scoffs] I mean, look at me.

03:29.840 --> 03:30.840
I'm a fuck-up.

You ain't gotta say nuttin', it's true.

to make no more decisions for Gogo.

No more, Jess!

09:09.960 --> 09:11.520
Alright, let me tell you a story.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.760
Well, it's not so much
a story, as like... real life.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.400
I was watching this documentary
a little while ago, like.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.400
It was about these hunters
in the Kalahari Desert.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.960
And how they hunted these monkeys, well,

09:27.040 --> 09:28.760
they're not monkeys,
they're baboons, yeah?

09:28.840 --> 09:32.280
So, what they do is they carve
a hole in the tree, 'bout this big,

09:34.160 --> 09:36.320
and stick melon seeds and that in there.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.200
Apparently, these monkeys...

09:39.280 --> 09:42.000
these baboons, love melon seeds.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.880
Mmm.

09:45.400 --> 09:49.400
So, this hunter
places the melon seeds in the hole,

09:49.480 --> 09:51.400
makes sure the baboon sees him doing it.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.880
Then he kicks back. He hides.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.040
He sits, he waits.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.720
See, now baboons are curious by nature.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.320
And this one particular baboon,

10:05.400 --> 10:08.720
he's seen this guy
put something in this hole,

10:09.480 --> 10:11.120
and now he's come to investigate.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.720
Checks the coast is clear,

10:14.240 --> 10:15.640
then he goes up to the tree.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.280
So he puts his hand in. [sniffs]

10:18.360 --> 10:20.160
He can smell it. Mmm!

10:21.320 --> 10:23.240
Knows it's good,
it's the good stuff.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.040
He's clear.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.520
He grabs it! He's got it!

10:28.640 --> 10:30.880
Everything he desires,
everything he wants.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.200
-Mmm.
-And now it's his.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.400
See now, he tries to pull out.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.880
But he can't.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.760
He's pulling.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.000
He wants to get it out, but he can't.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.520
He's stuck.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.280
See, now the hunter, he's smart.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.520
He designed the hole

10:55.600 --> 10:58.880
so only an empty hand
could come slide in and out.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.680
Baboon, he's screaming, struggling.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.240
He's going crazy
'cause he feels he's been trapped.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.840
But in reality, he's trapped himself.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.680
He could just let go and be free,

11:14.760 --> 11:18.320
but he doesn't, 'cause he's greedy.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.240
He's consumed.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.440
Holding on for dear life. He can't let go.

11:25.760 --> 11:30.080
Now the hunter,
knowing the baboon's trapped, comes back.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.880
Does what a hunter does.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.120
And you know what?

11:41.120 --> 11:43.640
Documentary got me thinking...

11:43.720 --> 11:44.680
'bout us.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.200
About how we trap ourselves.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.800
No one else.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.440
Just us.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.600
We do it to ourselves.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.080
And if you want to be free...

12:02.840 --> 12:04.880
I mean, really free,

12:04.960 --> 12:07.880
from negativity, the bullshit...

12:10.480 --> 12:11.880
you've just got to let go.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.480
It's that simple.

for me as it is already, like.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.640
Are we friends, or are we brothers?

12:53.480 --> 12:54.560
Exactly.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.240
Don't count the money.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.920
Make the money count.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.600
So where you going?
Need a lift to the airport?

13:05.680 --> 13:07.000
Nah. Nah, I'm good, bro.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.160

13:10.480 --> 13:13.200

made me realize summin'.

Listen, man,
you've always been kind to me, bro.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.680
And I've realized that

13:19.760 --> 13:22.120
it's not an easy thing to be
when you're from where we're from.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.640
So just know that I appreciate that.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.640

30:42.440 --> 30:44.120
They're taking the piss, blud.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.320
Been waiting for this fucking pizza
for like a hour now, you know?

30:49.320 --> 30:51.560
Yo, gimme this, man. One second, babe.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.720
You lot are taking the piss.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.600
Here's what I'm saying to you,
'cause I've had enough now.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.880
Listen, tell your boss,

30:55.960 --> 30:58.360
you see the next time one of his workers
take long with my food?

30:58.440 --> 31:01.040
I'm going to do some real ignorant shit
to one of his drivers.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.200
You hear what I'm saying to you?
[sucks teeth]

31:05.480 --> 31:07.040
[mutters] Flippin' pisspot, man.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.440
Yeah, babe, I am.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.880
Nah, babe, man. They're taking the piss.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.800
You know how much times
they've done this to me?

31:19.640 --> 31:23.320
Talking about last week, the week before.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.160
Starting to take this shit personal now,
man, serious now.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.400
[doorbell rings]

31:32.480 --> 31:34.640
Yo! Get the door!

31:36.160 --> 31:38.120
Tell them I ain't giving them
no more money, man!

31:39.040 --> 31:41.040
Dead pizza's cold anyway, again.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.520
Taking the piss, man.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.320
I don't know why I pay for this shit
anyway, you know?

31:46.400 --> 31:48.200
Should just rob them like they rob me.

31:49.680 --> 31:50.760
It's dead anyway, man.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.280
Nah, I know I shouldn't, man.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.480
But fuck it anyway. What was I saying now?

31:57.680 --> 31:59.360
Yeah, so you're living with me now.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.600
But things have got
to change up round here.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.400
Open the fucking door!

32:03.480 --> 32:06.040
[Slim]
Responsibilities and all that, you know?

32:06.120 --> 32:09.000
Can't be doing this shit forever,
you know?

32:09.080 --> 32:13.280
Man always have to stay woke
and be ready at all times, you know?

32:17.320 --> 32:18.760
Open the door!

32:18.840 --> 32:20.920
[Jess crying]

32:23.200 --> 32:25.440
[Slim] But you see
the things that you do in the past,

32:25.520 --> 32:27.760
have got a strange way
of haunting you in the future.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.680
Just the way it is, man. Karma's a bitch.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.080
-Open the fucking...
-Buss the gun, Bully!

32:35.960 --> 32:38.480
[gunshots]

32:38.560 --> 32:41.280
[Jess crying]

32:42.440 --> 32:44.280
[Slim] Yeah, not gonna lie,

32:44.360 --> 32:46.600
kind of looking forward
to the whole fatherhood shit, man.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.000
I think me and little man
are gonna get on just fine.

32:50.720 --> 32:54.160
He's young, man, so it's not too late
to show him the right way, you know?

32:56.920 --> 33:00.640
I mean, all he has to do is the opposite
to everything I've done in my life

33:00.720 --> 33:02.240
and he should be good, man.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.280
I'm the living example
of the wrong way to--

33:12.920 --> 33:15.240
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
It's hot, it's hot!

33:17.000 --> 33:19.560
-[gun clicks]
-[sucks teeth] Fuck.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.360
[woman on phone] Babe, are you OK?

33:21.440 --> 33:22.560
Hello?

33:24.360 --> 33:28.040
Oh, my God, baby, are you OK? Hello?

33:28.120 --> 33:29.800
[phone ringing]

33:34.920 --> 33:37.280
Yeah. Did you get the watch?

33:38.640 --> 33:40.280
What the fuck do you mean, man?

33:42.800 --> 33:44.760
Bro, you had one fucking job, man!

33:46.600 --> 33:49.840
Fuck's sake, man! Fuck's sake, fuck, man!

33:49.920 --> 33:52.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck's sake!

33:53.280 --> 33:54.960
Should have done it my fucking self!

33:56.760 --> 33:58.240
[sighs]

34:02.840 --> 34:04.160
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

34:07.640 --> 34:09.120
[door opens]

34:09.160 --> 34:11.200
Hey, Jess! Jess! Jess!

34:11.280 --> 34:13.920
Open the door, it's me, it's Gogo!

34:14.000 --> 34:16.640
-[Gogo shouting]
-[Jess sputtering]

34:18.160 --> 34:20.640
Open the door, open the door,
open the door.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.640
[Jess crying]

34:25.280 --> 34:28.040
Baby, baby, baby, it's alright,
it's alright. I'm here. I'm here, yeah?

34:28.120 --> 34:30.880
You OK? You OK?
What happened, what happened?

34:30.960 --> 34:32.320
You OK? Are you OK?

34:32.400 --> 34:35.200
I'm here now, I'm here now,
I'm here now, I'm here now. I'm here now,

34:35.320 --> 34:38.360
I'm here now. It's OK, it's OK.
You're safe, you're safe, yeah?

34:38.440 --> 34:40.880
[Jess breathing heavily]

34:55.640 --> 34:57.000
-Jess...
-What?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.480
-Babe, babe, babe, baby, baby.
-[Jess groans]

35:03.440 --> 35:07.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Babe, babe, babe, babe.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.840
Babe! Fuck!

35:08.920 --> 35:11.120
Babe, babe, babe, babe, no!

35:12.880 --> 35:15.680
Please. Jess, Jess, Jess,
Jess, Jess, Jess.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.920
Jess, Jess, Jess.
Please, please, please.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.600
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.040
Someone help!

35:22.120 --> 35:23.760
Someone!

35:23.840 --> 35:28.520
Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.960
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
You're gonna be fine, alright?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.600
Listen, I promise you,
you're gonna be fine.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.360
Yo, hello? Hello?

35:37.440 --> 35:40.200
I need an ambulance now!
D'you understand what I'm saying to you?

35:40.320 --> 35:42.160
[narrator] Time.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.560
If by some miracle
I could go back in time,

35:44.640 --> 35:46.400
speak with my younger self,

35:46.480 --> 35:48.600
what could I tell a young, stubborn,

35:48.640 --> 35:51.080
hot-headed 14-year-old boy
who thinks the world's against him?

35:54.200 --> 35:56.680
A kid who pretends to know it all
but in reality,

35:56.800 --> 35:59.640
in reality he's shit scared
'cause he hasn't got a clue.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.440
No. Listen, listen, listen... [stammers]

36:01.520 --> 36:03.960
Please, I just need you
to fucking come here now, please!

36:04.040 --> 36:06.160
What could I possibly tell him
that'll make a difference?

36:07.960 --> 36:11.640
Hmm, let me think.
I think I'll tell him this.

36:12.640 --> 36:16.120
I'd say, not everyone
who's against you is your enemy,

36:17.280 --> 36:19.600
and not everyone who's with you
is your friend.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.400
Just pick your company wisely.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.680
Look, baby, baby, it's gonna be OK,
it's gonna be OK.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.600
Look, man, you heard
what the fuck I said?

36:26.640 --> 36:30.120
And learn a discipline,
learn how to fight, use your fists.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.640
Trust me, even if you never have
to throw a real punch in your life,

36:35.560 --> 36:38.200
the discipline and commitment
you'll learn from it will help you

36:38.320 --> 36:40.680
with the much more important battles,

36:40.800 --> 36:42.880
battles you'll be fighting
every day of your life.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.160
Look, man,
I told you, hurry the fuck up, man!

36:45.280 --> 36:49.120
And read. Read every book
you possibly can, man.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.640
The long boring ones,
the controversial ones,

36:51.760 --> 36:54.200
even the ones that might
not at first make any sense.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.520
Just read.

36:56.400 --> 37:00.640
It turns out it's true what they say,
knowledge really is power.

37:02.960 --> 37:03.960
[Gogo pleading]

37:04.040 --> 37:06.640
When you're angry,
be silent if you can't be calm.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.880
[Gogo] Fuck off, man!
Please, please, please!

37:08.960 --> 37:10.520
And know this much,

37:10.600 --> 37:12.960
if you wait until you think you're well
and truly ready,

37:13.040 --> 37:16.680
you'll be waiting
for the rest of your life. So do it now.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.160
That's what I'm trying
to fucking say to you, man!

37:19.280 --> 37:21.760
And try not to swear too.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.000
In fact, try to perfect your bad habits
before you have kids.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.080
See, children don't hear us,
like, they actually imitate us,

37:30.080 --> 37:32.080
and if you don't get it right,
it's like...

37:32.160 --> 37:33.760
it's like a vicious cycle, man,

37:33.840 --> 37:36.960
just history repeating itself,
again and again.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.520
[screaming, crying]

37:38.600 --> 37:41.360
Please, please.
Please, please, please, please.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.160
Dream. Dream so big

37:43.200 --> 37:46.360
you feel uncomfortable telling your dreams
to small-minded people.

37:46.440 --> 37:49.160
Dream big and then you chase those dreams,

37:49.280 --> 37:51.160
even when they laugh and joke

37:51.280 --> 37:53.200
and make you feel like
they're the most unrealistic,

37:53.320 --> 37:55.160
idiotic ideas in the whole entire world.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.040
Yo, chase them, trust me.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.360
Chase them like there's no tomorrow.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.400
[Gogo] It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Someone help!

38:02.480 --> 38:06.160
'Cause most kids nowadays just dream about
being professional YouTubers.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.560
There's no more astronauts around anymore.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.000
Don't let her go.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.960
No matter how many times you argue,

38:15.040 --> 38:18.400
no matter how many times she
packs that bag, don't let that girl go.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.640
She's the best thing
that'll ever happen to you.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.880
You just don't know it yet.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.960
[distant sirens]

38:25.600 --> 38:28.520
[Gogo crying, Jess muttering]

38:30.680 --> 38:34.200
Travel. Whenever you get the opportunity,
travel. Trust me.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.840
Step out of your comfort zone,
see the world.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.120
You'll come back a changed man,
mark my words.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.520
You'll see the world's bigger
than any beef you have

38:43.600 --> 38:45.560
or any postcode or borough you're from.

38:45.640 --> 38:49.680
The world's a beautiful place, man.
You deserve to see it one day.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.480
[banging head and groaning]

38:55.120 --> 39:00.200
Oh, and cry. Just from time to time,
let it all out. It won't hurt.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.200
You'll be OK.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.360
Don't let people
make you feel less than them,

39:08.160 --> 39:10.960
or even hopeless
just because of what they think of you.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.920
Nah. You should feel proud in fact,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.280
proud of where you've come from,
because it's your journey.

39:17.360 --> 39:20.520
It belongs to you, so be patient,

39:20.600 --> 39:22.960
with a beautiful patience.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.480
You have so much potential, man.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.760
You just haven't realized it yet.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.800
You will though in time.

39:32.280 --> 39:35.760
Look, no one's got all the answers,
like, no one,

39:36.640 --> 39:39.160
but if you don't learn
from what killed your father,

39:39.200 --> 39:41.080
that same thing will kill you.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.160
Jess, Jess, Jess. It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine. It's fine.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.520
Listen, listen,
you know what I'm telling you.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.440
I already told you where
the fucking street is!

39:47.520 --> 39:50.640
And never underestimate
the power of an apology.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.160
It works wonders
when it's said from the heart.

39:53.280 --> 39:56.920
[Gogo] I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It's my
fault. It's my fault, Jess! I'm sorry!

39:57.000 --> 39:58.680
Tell him you love him now.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.640
Not tomorrow, not next week.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.040
Tell him now,

40:02.120 --> 40:06.160
because later, later you might
not be able to tell him at all.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.400
Jess, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.160
[Jess moaning]

40:12.280 --> 40:15.000
The respect you think you've earned
in the streets as a result of the fear

40:15.080 --> 40:17.800
or how many people you've hurt
will be long forgotten,

40:17.880 --> 40:21.320
and no one will even care
by the time you're 36, to be honest.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.680
Instead it will be your compassion
and your willingness to help others.

40:28.640 --> 40:32.480
That's what you'll be respected
and remembered for. So be kind.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.760
Raise beautiful children.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.680
Inside and out.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.760
Bless your food before you eat it.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.600
Oh, and lastly, when it's your time to go,

40:53.640 --> 40:57.120
remember that none of it comes with you,
like none of it.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.040
We leave it all behind.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.600
Every. Single. Thing.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.680
See, nothing in this life is ever owned.

41:07.640 --> 41:08.800
It's simply borrowed.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.520
We have to give it all back when we leave.

41:11.600 --> 41:15.160
[Gogo crying, Jess moaning]

41:15.280 --> 41:16.920
[scoffs] Ah, man.

41:17.960 --> 41:21.160
I wish I could go back in time
and tell my younger self exactly that.

41:22.640 --> 41:26.120
That everything is borrowed,
including time.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.840
I think it would have made all the
difference to me knowing that back then,

41:30.920 --> 41:31.960
[distant sirens]

41:32.040 --> 41:33.920
I know it would have in fact.

41:34.880 --> 41:37.320
[narrator sighs] Back in time.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.880
Yeah, that's exactly
what we have to do right now.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.960
Go back in time. To when it all began.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.880
[clock ticking]

41:50.960 --> 41:53.000
[clock ticking slows]

41:57.520 --> 41:59.960
[phone taking photos]

42:01.080 --> 42:03.400
I'm telling you,
no matter what filter I slap on,

42:03.960 --> 42:07.160
no matter what the lighting looks like,
you're always gonna look slapped.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.200
Nah, man, let me see these, man.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.520
Oi, these are dead, bruv. What you doing?

42:13.600 --> 42:15.040
You didn't get the chain in proper, man?

42:15.120 --> 42:16.600
Bro, you think you're bad
with this chain, man?

42:16.640 --> 42:18.840
My ting's icy, fam.
Look at the diamonds, cuz.

42:18.920 --> 42:21.960
Gyal I'm gonna draw on this chain?
You're stupid blud.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.440
Bro, furthermore, cuz,
