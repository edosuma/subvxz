01:05.967 --> 01:09.900
I'm deciding on a birthday gift
for Dorothy. How's this...

01:09.967 --> 01:14.500
"Good-looking, single, white male
seeks fun times on a regular basis"?

01:16.200 --> 01:18.066
Well, it's something she doesn't have.

01:19.867 --> 01:22.467
-Hi.
-Dorothy, you're home from school.

01:22.533 --> 01:28.800
You've said the same thing to me
since I was in third grade.

01:28.867 --> 01:32.367
-That's sweet.
-It's not sweet. It's pathetic.

01:34.333 --> 01:38.367
52 years and you never stopped anywhere.
Get a life!

01:40.467 --> 01:43.600
-Did you teach anybody anything today?
-I tried,

01:43.667 --> 01:47.700
but none of the kids seem interested
in diagramming sentences.

01:47.767 --> 01:53.133
I don't get it. Am I the only one
who thinks diagramming sentences is fun?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.233
You talk like this on dates, don't you?

01:58.200 --> 02:02.300
You're a substitute.
Your job isn't actually to teach.

02:02.367 --> 02:03.567
What is it?

02:03.633 --> 02:07.867
To keep the kids from burning
the school down.

02:09.033 --> 02:10.266
Normally you'd be right,

02:10.333 --> 02:13.033
but this class knows
I'm filling in all semester.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.934
It's nice having
the same class every day

02:16.000 --> 02:18.266
and watching them grow and learn.

02:18.333 --> 02:22.233
And they're not trying
the usual substitute shenanigans.

02:34.934 --> 02:37.533
Is that "kick me hard" sign
a fashion statement?

02:39.300 --> 02:40.600
Another one?

02:41.633 --> 02:44.734
No, this isn't what you think.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.300
This isn't because I'm a substitute.

02:47.567 --> 02:51.233
It's because I'm flunking
the football star

02:51.300 --> 02:53.600
and he won't get to play on Saturday.

02:53.667 --> 02:56.433
What a relief. I thought it was a joke.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.734
Turns out they really hate you.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.834
Why don't you pass him so he can play?

03:03.900 --> 03:06.633
I doubt that <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>
comes up in a huddle.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.500
I agree.

03:09.567 --> 03:12.934
Saturday's game is a big one,
and speaking as a former cheerleader

03:13.000 --> 03:15.633
and ex-bad girl in a health film...

03:18.700 --> 03:23.066
I can tell you the importance
of extracurricular activities.

03:23.133 --> 03:27.300
I want you to know
I don't enjoy failing anybody,

03:27.367 --> 03:30.333
especially this kid. But he's lazy.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.734
In his book report
on <i>A Tale of Two Cities,</i>

03:32.800 --> 03:36.433
he said he likes both,
but prefers Minneapolis

03:36.500 --> 03:38.600
'cause that's where prince is from.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.800
-Hi, Rose.
-Hi, honey.

03:43.867 --> 03:47.066
Rose? Honey? Is something wrong?

03:47.133 --> 03:50.200
I just had my teeth worked on.

03:50.266 --> 03:52.066
What was it, a wisdom tooth?

03:59.200 --> 04:01.333
My dentist touched me.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.467
I think he felt my breast.

04:03.533 --> 04:06.333
-Rose, that's terrible.
-What happened?

04:06.400 --> 04:09.967
When the gas wore off
and my head cleared,

04:10.033 --> 04:14.433
Lou, that's my dentist,
said he was checking my heartbeat,

04:14.500 --> 04:16.900
but I think it was more than that.

04:16.967 --> 04:20.166
Why, Rose? What gave you that idea?

04:20.233 --> 04:23.567
I don't think "wowee wow wow wow"
is a medical term.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.400
How could he do a thing like that?

04:31.467 --> 04:36.834
Just because medical men wear white
does not mean they're angels.

04:36.900 --> 04:41.166
He did something horrible and unethical.
He has to answer for it.

04:41.233 --> 04:45.300
We'll find the proper authorities
and lodge a complaint.

04:45.367 --> 04:48.200
I wish men had breasts, just for one day.

04:49.233 --> 04:53.233
Then they'd know what it's like
to be judged by some physical trait.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.633
Just because I'm built like this,

04:55.700 --> 04:59.000
you wouldn't believe how many people
think I'm dumb.

05:03.900 --> 05:07.333
You're too hard on yourself. Some people
think you're dumb over the phone.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.800
(serene music playing)

05:14.100 --> 05:16.700
-(doorbell rings)
-Doorbell.

05:19.767 --> 05:22.734
-(doorbell rings)
-Doorbell!

05:24.767 --> 05:28.300
Ma, what is the matter with you?
Can't you answer door?

05:28.367 --> 05:30.934
My butt's asleep
and I'm kind of getting into it.

05:36.266 --> 05:39.233
-We need to talk.
-Yeah, come in, coach.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.233
Ma, this is Nick Odlivak,
the football coach.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.100
I never thought I'd say this
but I think you can do better.

05:48.266 --> 05:50.200
Coach, let me save you a speech.

05:50.533 --> 05:53.967
Kevin deserves an F.
And that's what he's getting.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.800
In all the years I've been at
St. Sebastian's,

05:55.867 --> 05:58.200
Kevin's the best athlete
I've ever coached.

05:58.266 --> 06:01.400
For the very first time
we got a genuine shot at taking state.

06:01.467 --> 06:04.200
With Kevin playing we can
win that game in our sleep.

06:04.266 --> 06:05.767
My butt's asleep.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.333
We don't get much company.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.066
Look, that's my decision,
goodbye, coach.

06:13.133 --> 06:16.533
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll sweeten the pot.

06:17.166 --> 06:21.200
You let Kevin play this weekend,
and I'll take you out Saturday night.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.433
You haven't read <i>The Art of the Deal</i>
have you, coach?

06:32.266 --> 06:33.934
Do I smell aftershave?

06:36.300 --> 06:39.767
The coach was here trying to get me
to compromise my principals.

06:39.834 --> 06:43.200
I don't see what the big deal is
about passing this boy.

06:43.266 --> 06:46.367
In my neck of the woods,
they practically gave grades away.

06:46.433 --> 06:50.600
In your neck of the woods
men named Bubba get into law school.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.767
It's time that somebody took a stand.

06:54.834 --> 06:58.633
It's time that somebody made a difference
in Kevin's life.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.066
Rose, did you make the call?

07:01.133 --> 07:04.867
I appreciate you giving me
the dental examiner's number,

07:04.934 --> 07:07.867
but when I thought about
filing a report--

07:07.934 --> 07:12.133
People like your dentist
count on their victims backing down.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.800
-You have to have courage.
-Rose, this is not unusual.

07:15.867 --> 07:18.400
Usually, when a person is molested,

07:18.467 --> 07:21.867
it's by a friend or a relative,
someone they know.

07:21.934 --> 07:25.667
But there are other considerations.
What if I were wrong?

07:26.367 --> 07:30.967
Last time I had courage,
I confronted Lukan Ulfnooner,

07:31.033 --> 07:33.500
St. Olaf's moodiest plastic surgeon.

07:35.066 --> 07:39.300
-Thank you, Rose. That was a great story.
-Nice try, Dorothy.

07:42.033 --> 07:45.533
Anyway, Dr. Ulfnooner did
some work on my mom.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.533
Do you know who she came out looking like?
Raymond Massey.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.300
Rose, that's terrible.

07:53.767 --> 07:58.066
That's what I thought when I accused him
of malpractice and ruined his business.

07:58.467 --> 08:02.500
-Unfortunately, little did I know...
-Know what, Rose?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.734
That was the look she was going for.

08:10.266 --> 08:12.567
Rose, just because you
had one bad experience

08:12.633 --> 08:15.000
doesn't mean you shouldn't
confront Dr. Norgan.

08:15.066 --> 08:18.000
-You were taken advantage of.
-Blanche, I was groggy.

08:18.066 --> 08:20.834
I'm not 100% sure he did it.

08:21.266 --> 08:24.433
As for being taken advantage of,
look who's talking.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
I beg your pardon.

08:28.467 --> 08:32.400
When I submit to a man's advances,
it is with my consent.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.000
A woman has the option to say no.

08:36.066 --> 08:39.934
You weren't given that option.
You were given nitrous oxide.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.900
By the way, Blanche,
when did you ever say no?

08:48.533 --> 08:52.066
Did I say we'd have a question and answer
period after I spoke?

08:54.000 --> 08:59.433
(mellow music playing)

09:06.367 --> 09:11.233
Oh, Sophia. Thank you, honey.
How perfectly lovely.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.967
I was boiling water anyway
to shrink the cyst on my backside.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.467
I figured, what the hell,
I'll throw in a tea bag,

09:23.533 --> 09:25.033
and make myself a hero.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.066
(doorbell rings)

09:34.133 --> 09:38.300
-Father O'Mara. This is a surprise.
-May I come in?

09:38.367 --> 09:42.834
Please, come in.
Ma, Blanche. This is father O'Mara.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.033
St. Sebastian's Dean of boys.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.600
Father, this is my mother,
Sophia Petrillo.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.500
My roommate Blanche Devereaux.

09:49.567 --> 09:52.700
Blanche Devereaux.
I've heard quite a bit about you.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.967
All good, I hope.

09:58.033 --> 10:01.400
I'm sorry. I can't reveal things learned
in confession.

10:03.734 --> 10:07.133
But it's nice to match
the name with the face.

10:08.266 --> 10:10.900
Father, sit down.
Would you like something to drink?

10:10.967 --> 10:14.233
-Tea, if it's no trouble.
-No, not at all.

10:15.033 --> 10:17.900
I had some boiling water,
because of this cyst--

10:17.967 --> 10:19.133
Ma!

10:22.133 --> 10:25.266
Dorothy, as you're
already eminently aware,

10:25.333 --> 10:29.166
St. Sebastian's has
a very big football game on Saturday.

10:29.233 --> 10:33.533
I would think that you of all people
would have higher ideals.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.900
The highest.

10:35.266 --> 10:37.533
What I'm trying to say to you, Dorothy,

10:37.600 --> 10:42.533
is I truly believe that he would want
Kevin to play on Saturday.

10:45.266 --> 10:49.367
Really? I had no idea that <i>he...</i>

10:50.800 --> 10:53.867
took such an interest
in high school football.

10:55.233 --> 10:59.166
Oh, yes, he likes all sports,
even gymnastics.

10:59.233 --> 11:02.033
I'm told you're quite the gymnast.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.767
Oops.

11:10.066 --> 11:13.367
Father, I could use the support
of the administration.

11:13.433 --> 11:17.300
I'm thinking of the school as a whole.
I'm thinking of the community.

11:17.367 --> 11:19.433
I'm thinking about Kevin.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.200
If there's nothing
I can say to change your mind...

11:22.266 --> 11:26.834
I should inform you
we have an active and vocal alumni.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.734
-I can't be responsible for them.
-Is that a threat?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.066
More like a... concern.

11:33.133 --> 11:37.467
I appreciate your concern, father.
But I'm sticking to my decision.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.967
Ma, what is it now?

11:43.100 --> 11:48.000
You threw a priest out. You disgust me.
I'm going to sit in my tea.

11:50.200 --> 11:54.033
(calm music playing)

12:00.834 --> 12:02.166
Ma, what are you doing?

12:02.233 --> 12:05.500
I can't believe my daughter
threw a priest out.

12:05.567 --> 12:09.066
Ma, you have relatives
who threw priests out of windows.

12:11.734 --> 12:13.066
That was business.

12:14.834 --> 12:19.600
-Somebody left this for you on the porch.
-Oh, what is it?

12:21.200 --> 12:25.500
-A fish wrapped in newspaper.
-Dorothy, you know what this means?

12:25.567 --> 12:27.100
White wine with dinner?

12:29.200 --> 12:31.233
Am I laughing? Read this note.

12:32.133 --> 12:35.000
"If Kevin Kelly doesn't
play in Saturday's game...

12:35.066 --> 12:37.800
Dorothy Z sleeps with the fishes."

12:39.400 --> 12:42.934
-Give the kid a D.
-Ma, it's just a prank.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.133
You don't realize the significance
of football in the south.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.266
Men have broken dates with me
to go to football games.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.333
Nobody's going to kill me
over a high school football game.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.734
They killed this fish.
Dorothy, please, I'm scared.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.900
All right, all right, Ma.

13:00.967 --> 13:05.767
There's nothing to be scared about.
I'll change Kevin's grade.

13:06.166 --> 13:09.433
This isn't worth it.
I can't put you through this.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.333
I thought I could make a difference.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.100
I can't. They win.

13:13.700 --> 13:17.100
-Thank you. That makes me feel better.
-That's good.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.867
-Could we have a big screen TV?
-No.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.233
Dorothy, please, I'm scared.

13:28.934 --> 13:32.900
(serene music playing)

13:33.433 --> 13:36.700
-What's going on?
-Blanche is telling me about Freud.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.934
Don't ask her.
I'm the one that slept with him.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.233
Sophia, this is serious.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.633
According to this,
if Rose doesn't confront Dr. Norgan,

13:50.700 --> 13:52.800
she could take her hostilities out on us.

13:52.867 --> 13:54.834
Tunnels.
He loved to drive through tunnels.

13:58.967 --> 14:02.967
Cheesecake. Good idea.
Now we can be old and fat.

14:04.433 --> 14:05.467
Let me handle this.

14:06.166 --> 14:09.300
Rose, you obviously
had a very traumatic childhood.

14:09.367 --> 14:14.200
I need to hear your whole life.
Tell me your first memory.

14:14.266 --> 14:17.533
Ma, I'm sorry. I didn't want your last
days to be like this.

14:21.533 --> 14:24.467
Close your eyes and think back.
What do you see?

14:24.533 --> 14:25.667
A cow.

14:32.934 --> 14:39.200
A chicken, a goat, a lamb, a rooster...
No, two roosters...

14:40.467 --> 14:41.467
A pig.

14:42.133 --> 14:43.767
There's a man with a gun.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.700
He lifts the gun up into the air.

14:47.166 --> 14:48.433
He shoots it...

14:48.500 --> 14:55.166
and they're off! The pig takes the lead.
The roosters are neck and neck.

14:55.233 --> 14:57.667
Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose.

14:57.734 --> 15:00.934
Before the menagerie
rounds the clubhouse turn,

15:01.033 --> 15:04.300
you have to make the decision
to confront Dr. Norgan.

15:04.367 --> 15:08.066
You can't keep something like this
bottled up inside.

15:08.133 --> 15:11.300
-I have trouble confronting people.
-Yeah, right, Ma.

15:11.367 --> 15:14.300
Like when you made the butcher cry?

15:15.734 --> 15:18.500
The man wouldn't trim the fat.
What choice did I have?

15:19.600 --> 15:24.166
When somebody does something
that violates you, you should tell them.

15:24.233 --> 15:26.300
It's not easy living with yourself

15:26.367 --> 15:28.633
when you haven't stood
behind your beliefs.

15:29.166 --> 15:34.900
-I know. I backed down myself today.
-I have to talk to him.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.066
You'll feel better.

15:36.133 --> 15:38.900
I'll go. Thank you, Blanche, all of you.

15:39.400 --> 15:44.700
Blanche, you did a pretty good job
focusing this for Rose, and for me.

15:45.100 --> 15:48.834
I'll admit you would have made
a very good psychologist.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.300
Great idea.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.967
Give Blanche an office with a couch
and a license to charge by the hour.

15:59.066 --> 16:04.934
(mellow music playing)

16:07.200 --> 16:09.300
-(doorbell rings)
-Doorbell.

16:18.734 --> 16:21.867
Uh, morning, Ms. Zbornak. Can we come in?

16:21.934 --> 16:24.400
Well, I don't know, Kevin. Can you?

16:26.433 --> 16:30.100
-Uh, may we come in?
-Of course. Come right in.

16:30.166 --> 16:33.834
That didn't sound like
it deserved an "f."

16:34.834 --> 16:37.767
That's because Kevin
is not an "f" student.

16:37.834 --> 16:41.867
It's not that I'm lazy.
I'm just busy with ball.

16:42.233 --> 16:45.633
I didn't have time
to read<i> A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

16:45.700 --> 16:50.500
That was my fault, Kevin, for interrupting
the high school experience with a book.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.200
Hey, you didn't know.

16:59.166 --> 17:02.200
What are you going to do
when you're competing

17:02.266 --> 17:05.033
with men who have applied themselves...

17:05.100 --> 17:07.967
like Ralph Zaldin,
the boy whose underpants

17:08.033 --> 17:11.066
you turned into a hat
yesterday after school?

17:12.066 --> 17:16.033
Well, I'm sorry, Ms. Zbornak,
but Ralph Zaldin's a geek.

17:16.100 --> 17:20.500
A student pays attention, works hard,
gets good grades...

17:20.567 --> 17:24.333
-does that make him a geek?
-That makes him a dork.

17:26.066 --> 17:28.934
Geek is somebody with no friends,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.934
stays home every Saturday night,
always buried in books.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.100
One word and I cut off
your supply of Metamucil.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.200
Kevin, you're in this trouble

17:44.266 --> 17:47.633
because you have not
been working up to your ability.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.934
I'll tell you what.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.300
Spare me two evenings a week.
I'll give you an incomplete

17:54.367 --> 17:58.367
and tutor you privately
until you can pass the whole course.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.100
That way you'll be
eligible to play tomorrow.

18:01.166 --> 18:04.300
Fine. Fine. As soon as
football season's over.

18:04.367 --> 18:08.967
She's doing you a favor.
She's taking time from her schedule.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.000
They don't know you have no life.

18:15.266 --> 18:19.133
Kevin, take it or leave it.
These are my terms.

18:19.200 --> 18:23.100
You said if I was nice,
she would roll over.

18:23.166 --> 18:25.200
Winning tomorrow is up to you.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.000
Kevin.

18:27.066 --> 18:30.367
Life gets tougher outside the driver's Ed
car, doesn't it, coach?

18:31.800 --> 18:36.333
I'm going to make sure
Kevin plays in that game.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.767
If you don't want to make it easy, fine.
But you're not going to stop us.

18:39.834 --> 18:42.133
That boy will be playing.

18:43.266 --> 18:44.266
(door shuts)

18:45.967 --> 18:51.166
-At least I stood up for my principles.
-This is the proudest I've been of you.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.834
-Thanks, Ma.
-Can you believe it?

18:53.900 --> 18:56.700
My whole life,
and this is the proudest I've ever been.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.266
I'm depressed. I need a cookie.

19:05.734 --> 19:10.867
(calm music playing)

19:12.433 --> 19:14.166
-Hello, Rose.
-Hello.

19:14.233 --> 19:16.800
Let's get to work. Hop in the chair.

19:16.867 --> 19:19.867
-Dr. Norgan--
-What's this "Dr. Norgan"?

19:19.934 --> 19:21.000
What happened to "Lou"?

19:21.066 --> 19:24.200
There's something I have
to talk to you about.

19:24.266 --> 19:27.700
-Great. We'll talk while I work. Sit.
-Well, I...

19:31.934 --> 19:33.633
-Here we go.
-I'll do that.

19:35.800 --> 19:40.367
-What is it you wanted to talk about?
-Well, I...

19:44.367 --> 19:49.700
-(mumbling)
-Rose, don't be ridiculous.

19:49.767 --> 19:52.433
Feel free to discuss any subject with me.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.700
(mumbles)

19:54.767 --> 19:57.033
Certainly I remember our last appointment.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.467
Bill's in the mail. Ha ha ha.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.734
(mumbling)

20:02.800 --> 20:05.533
There was nothing
unusual about the procedure.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.967
I put in a temp.
You're ready for a crown.

20:09.633 --> 20:13.100
-I'm not talking about the procedure.
-I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

20:15.533 --> 20:16.533
You touched me.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.767
You... you fondled me, didn't you?

20:19.834 --> 20:22.800
Rose, this happens to
dentists all the time.

20:23.400 --> 20:27.800
A side effect of the anesthesia
can be hallucinations, fantasy...

20:28.300 --> 20:29.400
it's like a dream.

20:29.467 --> 20:33.400
I probably brushed against you
and in your woozy state--

20:33.467 --> 20:36.066
-I am so sorry.
-It's all right, Rose.

20:36.834 --> 20:40.533
-Why don't we look at that crown?
-You must hate me.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.734
I don't hate you. You're a friend.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.066
I look forward to our times together.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.834
You truly are a considerate,
compassionate, understanding woman.

20:57.667 --> 20:58.667
A lovely woman.

20:59.367 --> 21:01.467
Delicate. Innocent.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.367
Enchanting.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.300
Wowee-wow-wow-wow.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.700
-Stand back! I'm not afraid to use this!
-What are you doing?

21:14.367 --> 21:19.233
Oh, darn you! I believed you!
I even apologized to you!

21:19.300 --> 21:22.166
I forgot myself.
It will never happen again.

21:22.233 --> 21:26.900
You're damn right it won't! I'm reporting
you to the state dental board.

21:26.967 --> 21:29.934
-There's just one more thing.
-What?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.333
Dance.

21:34.667 --> 21:39.266
(serene music playing)

21:40.200 --> 21:42.233
-(knock on door)
-Come in.

21:44.834 --> 21:47.800
Oh, no. You're not a substitute nurse,
too, are you?

21:51.667 --> 21:53.367
I'm sorry about your knee.

21:53.433 --> 21:56.467
You wouldn't have been blind-sided
staying in the pocket.

21:56.533 --> 21:59.000
-You know football?
-I know everything.

22:02.367 --> 22:05.266
I see people have
already signed your cast.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.500
Yeah. The guys from the team.

22:07.567 --> 22:10.100
-Are you signing it?
-Correcting it.

22:14.300 --> 22:17.500
There is no "k" in "victory."

22:19.200 --> 22:26.200
Oh, yeah. And we'll just change this to,
"Miss Zbornak eats shitake mushrooms."

22:30.433 --> 22:34.567
If you're feeling guilty
about not influencing my life, don't.

22:35.066 --> 22:37.800
People always try to get me to be serious.

22:37.867 --> 22:39.266
We made a deal.

22:39.667 --> 22:44.934
You promised me I could tutor you
once football season was over, and it is.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.266
This isn't fair. I can't move.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.834
I know. It'll be like
teaching fish in a barrel.

22:52.467 --> 22:54.867
-Shall I begin?
-Is there a choice?

22:54.934 --> 22:56.734
You could push the call button,

22:56.800 --> 22:59.767
but I'll be finished before
the nurse gets here.

23:02.934 --> 23:08.734
So, "It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

23:09.166 --> 23:10.633
Good stuff, huh?

23:11.300 --> 23:15.166
"It was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness.

23:15.467 --> 23:17.967
It was the epic of belief...

23:18.300 --> 23:20.633
it was the epic of incredulity.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.300
It was the season of light..."

23:24.433 --> 23:31.266
(theme music playing)
