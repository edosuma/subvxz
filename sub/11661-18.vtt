(mellow music playing)

01:05.333 --> 01:08.867
Pussycat, when's the last time
I told you, you were beautiful?

01:08.934 --> 01:11.233
June 1, 1949.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.000
At my wedding.

01:15.066 --> 01:18.100
Oh, well, that's because pregnant women
have that special glow.

01:21.266 --> 01:24.300
It's time to tell you again.
You're beautiful.

01:24.367 --> 01:27.600
-What do you want?
-You're so suspicious. I'm hurt.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.567
This is why the compliments
only come every 40 years.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.500
I'm sorry, Ma.

01:33.567 --> 01:36.734
Enough to be in the Shady Pines'
mother/daughter beauty pageant?

01:38.266 --> 01:41.266
You hate Shady Pines.
Why do you want to go back?

01:41.333 --> 01:43.533
Two words, Gladys Goldfine.

01:43.600 --> 01:48.567
Just because you don't like her doesn't
mean we have to embarrass ourselves.

01:48.633 --> 01:53.100
This is my chance
to put that witch in her place.

01:53.166 --> 01:57.500
I'm a looker, and my daughter's twice
as beautiful as hers.

01:57.567 --> 02:00.900
-Ma, that's very sweet, but--
-Then I thought, wait.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.567
Your sister Gloria's in California.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.166
So, it's you or nothing.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.734
Please, Dorothy.
If we win, I'll die a happy woman.

02:13.800 --> 02:19.333
I won't be part of your neurotic need
to win. Just let it go.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.000
How many challenges do I have left?

02:22.066 --> 02:24.533
Seeing if I can get halfway
across the street

02:24.600 --> 02:27.033
before the "don't walk" sign comes on?

02:28.667 --> 02:30.700
Trying to stay awake on the john?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.066
Hoping it is the john?

02:37.233 --> 02:40.000
Competition is the thing
that keeps me going...

02:40.533 --> 02:44.600
-but if you want me to let it go...
-All right.

02:44.667 --> 02:47.333
All right, all right. Ma, I'll do it.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.133
You've made me a happy woman.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.400
Now, if you want to go the extra mile...

02:53.200 --> 02:56.433
I hear one of the judges has a fetish...

03:00.400 --> 03:03.233
Dorothy's going to be in the
mother/daughter beauty pageant with me.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.333
Oh, really? I know a judge.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.433
Just keep telling the bald guy
he's been naughty.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.100
(doorbell rings)

03:15.400 --> 03:18.667
Hello, I'm David Patton.
I'm looking for George Devereaux.

03:18.734 --> 03:19.734
Yeah, I'll get him.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.233
Oh, he's dead.

03:23.834 --> 03:27.266
-My husband died a few years ago.
-I see.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.000
What do you need?

03:29.066 --> 03:32.600
I'm selling encyclopedias,
and his name's on my list.

03:33.133 --> 03:36.800
I hope I haven't bothered you.
I'm sorry about your husband.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.533
Oh, now that is really odd.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.500
If he's selling encyclopedias,
why didn't he try to sell us a set?

03:45.567 --> 03:48.800
You know what else is so strange about it?
He didn't bring them in.

03:53.233 --> 03:59.100
Rose, no encyclopedia salesman
lugs around 26 volumes door-to-door.

03:59.166 --> 04:02.700
Are you kidding?
In St. Olaf, they carry 52.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.867
-Why?
-Balance.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.800
Rose, why don't they just carry
13 in each hand?

04:15.700 --> 04:17.700
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

04:19.800 --> 04:26.567
(serene music playing)

04:30.266 --> 04:34.734
Dorothy, Rose, the oddest thing
happened at the market.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.734
I saw that young man
who was looking for George.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.934
-David something or other.
-What's so odd? He was shopping.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.767
He wasn't shopping, Dorothy.
He was undressing me with his eyes.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.367
That handsome young man
is obviously smitten.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.300
Blanche, I don't know.

05:00.367 --> 05:04.233
If he had a crush,
why was he asking for George?

05:04.300 --> 05:08.233
Because he's loved from afar,
and that was his way of approaching,

05:08.300 --> 05:10.734
but he lost his nerve.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.767
If you are right,
you're taking this too lightly.

05:14.834 --> 05:19.233
He may be infatuated,
but he also might be a nut.

05:19.300 --> 05:23.667
I tell you, he's in love.
Rose, what do you think?

05:24.567 --> 05:27.266
A sex-crazed psycho
with a granny complex.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.100
I call them as I see them.

05:39.266 --> 05:40.400
Look, pussycat.

05:40.467 --> 05:43.567
I found matching dresses
for the evening gown competition.

05:43.633 --> 05:47.133
Ma, those are totally inappropriate.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.600
Don't worry. They come
with matching panties.

05:51.066 --> 05:52.800
For when we do the cartwheels.

05:54.867 --> 05:56.233
Ma, forget it.

05:56.300 --> 06:00.033
Mine are going to say "hello",
and yours are going to say "America".

06:02.700 --> 06:06.633
Why can't we wear
something simple in basic black?

06:06.700 --> 06:10.800
Wear black at Shady Pines,
they'll stop the show for a head count.

06:14.133 --> 06:17.333
I knew I shouldn't have
gotten involved in this.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.433
-I wish I could say no.
-I know what you mean.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.900
I should have said no
to the St. Olaf pageant.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.333
It was 1951.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.133
That was the first year they let humans
enter.

06:35.133 --> 06:39.367
I was way ahead after the evening gown
and log rolling competition.

06:39.767 --> 06:44.200
People don't realize how hard it is
rolling logs in evening gowns.

06:47.734 --> 06:52.100
And the shocker is,
I lost out on the intelligence quiz.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.734
Surprise.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.166
Don't I know it.

06:59.233 --> 07:02.066
They asked me to name the seven dwarfs.
And I did.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.767
But evidently I didn't
name the seven they had in mind.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.533
Rose, hand me that newspaper.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.000
No. You're going to hit me with it.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.800
No, I won't.

07:15.867 --> 07:18.033
-You promise?
-I promise.

07:26.333 --> 07:33.200
(mellow music playing)

07:36.967 --> 07:40.333
Guess who's waiting
in a car outside our house?

07:41.467 --> 07:43.967
David. David, that's who.

07:44.433 --> 07:48.233
That car was there
three hours ago when I left.

07:48.300 --> 07:51.467
Blanche, the man is obviously
obsessed with you.

07:51.734 --> 07:53.467
I think he's a little nutty.

07:53.533 --> 07:57.100
Look, I've been involved
in these fatal attractions before.

08:00.266 --> 08:03.033
I can handle this.
I'll just go out there and tell him.

08:05.867 --> 08:09.133
Hi, Mrs. Devereaux.
Do you remember me?

08:09.467 --> 08:12.000
David, I want you
to come in and sit down.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.233
Now, we have to have a talk.

08:18.700 --> 08:22.133
I'm tired of you lurking
around outside my house...

08:22.433 --> 08:25.400
and tailing me at the supermarket.
Now, enough is enough.

08:25.467 --> 08:28.734
You have an unhealthy,
obsessive love for me.

08:34.133 --> 08:36.100
Honey, you need professional help.

08:37.166 --> 08:40.967
-I don't have those feelings for you.
-Oh.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.867
I have been following you, and I'm sorry.

08:46.133 --> 08:51.000
I have something to tell you,
and, well, it's just so difficult for me.

08:51.066 --> 08:55.200
Whenever I have something hard to say,
I say it fast.

08:55.266 --> 09:00.367
Like when I wanted to break up
with the captain of the football team.

09:00.433 --> 09:06.734
I was very nervous, so I spit it out.
"Carl, I'm dumping you for coach Wilkins."

09:12.667 --> 09:16.900
Afterwards, I felt much better.
You just go ahead and tell me.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.000
-Go ahead.
-Ok.

09:20.900 --> 09:24.166
George Devereaux, your husband...
was my father.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.667
Get out.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.367
What?

09:39.433 --> 09:42.467
Get out. I didn't hear what you said.

09:42.900 --> 09:46.834
If she didn't hear and she's this upset,
imagine--

09:46.900 --> 09:48.800
Shut up, Rose.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.400
David, why would you say a thing like
that?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.467
My mother passed away recently...

09:57.033 --> 10:00.100
and I discovered she'd been receiving
child support checks

10:00.166 --> 10:01.567
from a trust in Miami.

10:01.633 --> 10:04.633
I was told dad died before I was born.

10:05.200 --> 10:09.467
I found my birth certificate, and George
Devereaux was listed as my father.

10:09.533 --> 10:12.467
Maybe there was another
George Devereaux in Miami.

10:12.533 --> 10:16.333
-This was his address.
-Who also lived here.

10:21.967 --> 10:25.567
If I'd known he'd died,
I'd never have left Dallas.

10:25.633 --> 10:27.500
Well, now you know. Goodbye.

10:27.567 --> 10:30.266
It's painful, but there's
so much I need to know.

10:30.967 --> 10:35.133
What did he do for a living?
Did he have hobbies?

10:35.200 --> 10:36.467
At least one.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.667
Only you can help me.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.333
After you've had time,
maybe I could call you?

10:57.333 --> 10:59.767
I'm sorry about this. Really.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.533
I don't want to talk about it.

11:13.166 --> 11:15.767
Oh, how could George
betray me this way?

11:16.200 --> 11:18.900
Damn, those wedding vows
were sacred to me.

11:19.333 --> 11:23.533
Well, they must have been. I turned down
hundreds, thousands of offers...

11:25.533 --> 11:28.166
teachers, doctors, astronauts.

11:28.600 --> 11:33.033
I even said no to a journalist
famous for his work on <i>60 minutes.</i>

11:34.767 --> 11:37.266
If that's not fidelity,
I don't know what is.

11:38.567 --> 11:42.266
Then I find out
the only man I ever loved cheated on me.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.367
On me!

11:44.166 --> 11:45.567
Oh, I could just die.

11:52.467 --> 11:53.967
I'll bet it was Morley Safer.

12:00.433 --> 12:04.533
(serene music playing)

12:05.667 --> 12:08.200
-Blanche, I thought you were in bed.
-I couldn't sleep.

12:08.266 --> 12:10.367
It must be from living with old people.

12:15.066 --> 12:18.266
I've been going through my diaries.
Just listen to this.

12:19.266 --> 12:21.967
"March 3, 1967.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.900
George just back from Dallas.

12:24.233 --> 12:27.367
Surprised me with the most beautiful
diamond earrings.

12:27.433 --> 12:30.266
I love him so much
it takes my breath away.

12:30.333 --> 12:35.066
Ours is a love so pure, so complete,
it will outlast time itself.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.533
I'll have the earrings
appraised next week."

12:41.166 --> 12:42.433
See? That proves it.

12:43.967 --> 12:46.900
-Am I missing something?
-Proves what?

12:47.734 --> 12:50.000
Dallas, diamond earrings!

12:50.066 --> 12:54.934
George was obviously feeling guilty
about cheating on me with David's mother.

12:55.300 --> 12:59.367
-David was telling the truth.
-I know how you feel.

12:59.433 --> 13:02.700
I hate saying it.
Sal almost cheated on me.

13:02.767 --> 13:06.500
-Ma, really?
-I was pregnant with your brother.

13:06.867 --> 13:09.567
Just because I gained 40 pounds
and always cried,

13:09.633 --> 13:11.767
your father got the wandering eye.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.400
-Did you ever find out who it was?
-I never met her.

13:18.467 --> 13:22.433
I heard she was a short, scrawny,
bird-like thing who never shut up.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.800
I guess variety is the spice of life.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.533
My Charlie never cheated on me.

13:33.066 --> 13:36.734
I think it was because the divorce laws
were stringent in St. Olaf.

13:37.033 --> 13:40.133
The wife keeps
everything that doesn't ferment.

13:43.767 --> 13:48.767
Thanks for rubbing my nose in the fact
that your husband was faithful.

13:48.834 --> 13:53.433
-Why did George cheat on me?
-Why does any man cheat?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.000
Well, there are two popular theories,

13:56.066 --> 14:00.266
one, men are victims
of an evolutionary process

14:00.333 --> 14:03.767
which genetically programs
their sexual habits.

14:03.834 --> 14:06.066
-And two?
-Men are scum.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.567
(calm music playing)

14:13.633 --> 14:15.433
Ok, girls, I'm ready.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.567
Well, Rose, do I look like the mayor
of Palm Springs?

14:34.734 --> 14:37.266
Doug Henning
is the mayor of Palm Springs?

14:41.333 --> 14:43.400
Just play the music, Rose.

14:44.767 --> 14:49.166
(piano playing)

15:13.667 --> 15:16.633

Rose, what's wrong? There's another verse.

15:47.967 --> 15:49.367
I'm sorry...

15:49.433 --> 15:53.467
but this song always takes me back
to St. Olaf in the sixties.

15:54.867 --> 15:59.967
-A controversial issue divided the town.
-What, Rose, Vietnam?

16:00.333 --> 16:05.100
-Civil rights? Campus unrest?
-Opposite side of the street parking.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.333
Nobody could understand the concept.

16:10.800 --> 16:15.133
It doesn't matter which side you park on,
there's always an opposite side.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.734
What an injustice.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.934
Hemingway ran out of stories
to tell and shot himself.

16:22.433 --> 16:24.300
She just keeps on going.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.800
Oh, for goodness sakes!

16:28.867 --> 16:31.166
Why, you two could be
celebrity look-alikes.

16:31.233 --> 16:35.266
-Oh, Blanche, honey, you really think so?
-Well, absolutely.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.700
So which one's Cheech,
and which one's Chong?

16:45.633 --> 16:47.800
I'm Sonny Bono, you idiot!

16:49.100 --> 16:52.333
Gee, I wonder how many maître d'
have heard that line?

16:57.300 --> 16:59.667
Blanche, there's something
I need to tell you.

16:59.734 --> 17:02.767
I've told a lie and now
I have a guilty conscience.

17:02.834 --> 17:05.266
Really? I've heard that could happen.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.934
I lied to you when I said
Charlie never cheated on me.

17:10.967 --> 17:15.600
You know, he was this traveling salesman,
and one dark night he ran out of gas

17:15.667 --> 17:17.100
in front of his farm house.

17:17.433 --> 17:21.000
He knocked and asked the farmer
if he could spend the night.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.500
The farmer said, "Yes,
but there's only one place

17:23.567 --> 17:25.567
you can sleep, with my daughter."

17:30.433 --> 17:33.100
Ironically, if it were light out,

17:33.166 --> 17:36.600
Charlie would have realized
he was just two blocks away from home.

17:40.266 --> 17:43.433
It was embarrassing
as that story got around.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.600
I must have heard it a hundred times.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.500
Everybody thought it was a big joke.

17:49.900 --> 17:54.700
-That must have hurt.
-It hurt a lot. And it made me angry.

17:55.133 --> 17:58.467
I was so mad I refused
to make strudel for a year.

18:00.066 --> 18:05.300
-That's not so bad.
-Strudel was our pet name for sex.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.166
Wow. You were mad.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.233
You bet.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.467
But I decided one mistake

18:14.533 --> 18:17.500
shouldn't erase the memories
of all the good times

18:17.567 --> 18:19.533
or how much we loved each other.

18:20.066 --> 18:23.967
Don't throw George's memory away
just because he made a mistake.

18:27.433 --> 18:32.900
(calm music playing)

18:33.867 --> 18:35.867
Come on, you guys!
We're going to be late.

18:35.934 --> 18:37.700
I'll get the car.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.967
Ohh!

18:42.667 --> 18:45.934
-You all look beautiful.
-Why, thank you.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.767
(doorbell rings)

18:50.800 --> 18:54.667
-David, what are you doing here?
-I'm going back to Dallas tonight.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.033
Before I leave, there's
something I have to know.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.200
Oh, come on in.

18:59.533 --> 19:01.266
You all go on. I'll meet you there.

19:07.166 --> 19:10.166
-What is it?
-Did my father ever go fishing?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
What?

19:13.066 --> 19:17.467
As a kid, I fantasized about things
my father and I would've done together.

19:17.934 --> 19:20.934
Fishing was my favorite. Did he?

19:22.300 --> 19:24.500
-No.
-Oh.

19:25.867 --> 19:29.900
Look, I know my coming here hurt you,
but this wasn't any picnic for me, either.

19:30.967 --> 19:32.367
I'm angry, too.

19:32.433 --> 19:36.867
I grew up knowing nothing about my father,
who he was, what he was.

19:37.633 --> 19:40.300
I wish you'd tell me something about him.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.600
Whether you like it or not, I'm his son.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.367
He served in Korea.

19:53.467 --> 19:55.633
-Really?
-Army captain.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.533
Decorated for bravery...

19:58.066 --> 20:01.600
not before he graduated
top of his class at Vanderbilt.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.100
Hey, that's pretty good.

20:05.233 --> 20:08.333
Well, let's see.
There's so much to remember.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.000
Um... well, he was charming...

20:11.700 --> 20:13.300
uh, quite an athlete...

20:13.734 --> 20:14.734
intellectual.

20:15.934 --> 20:18.533
He could match wits
with anybody in town.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.033
Very handsome. The ladies loved him...

20:23.533 --> 20:24.834
apparently so.

20:27.433 --> 20:31.433
-I really appreciate all this.
-Would you like to see pictures?

20:31.500 --> 20:32.767
Very much.

20:45.066 --> 20:46.266
There he is.

20:46.900 --> 20:49.233
-I've got his eyes.
-I know.

20:49.767 --> 20:52.033
And, uh, here he is in uniform.

20:55.867 --> 20:56.900
Wait.

20:57.567 --> 21:01.166
-Is that him... on the boat?
-Well, I'll be!

21:01.233 --> 21:03.233
I guess he did go fishing after all.

21:05.033 --> 21:06.333
Say, would you like to have this?

21:07.200 --> 21:09.667
-Really?
-Well... you ought to have it.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.767
After all, you're his son.

21:13.734 --> 21:18.667
(serene music playing)

21:22.800 --> 21:24.033
Make way for the winners

21:24.100 --> 21:26.934
of the Shady Pines'
mother/daughter beauty contest!

21:27.000 --> 21:29.834
-Ta-da!
-Ohh!

21:34.900 --> 21:38.166
-You won!
-Actually, we're the runners-up,

21:38.233 --> 21:42.233
but if the reigning winners
can't fulfill their duties...

21:42.667 --> 21:47.433
And I'm telling you, the winning mother
and daughter are 98 and 77.

21:48.734 --> 21:52.100
If either one of them forgets to take her
nitroglycerin even once...

21:54.734 --> 21:57.633
Dorothy and I are going to be
cutting ribbons at Piggly Wiggly.

21:58.934 --> 22:03.500
But the big news is
we beat Gladys Goldfine, right, Ma?

22:03.567 --> 22:07.533
Ah, it was a hollow victory.
Time has taken its toll.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.433
She's not the fierce competitor
she once was.

22:10.867 --> 22:12.467
For the talent section,

22:12.533 --> 22:15.433
she was going to
do a medley from <i>The Fantasticks.</i>

22:15.500 --> 22:18.433
She started with "Try to Remember",
and she couldn't.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.934
More importantly,
what happened with David and you?

22:26.000 --> 22:30.867
I talked to him.
He's a very nice young man.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.800
I think I took my anger at George
out on David.

22:34.867 --> 22:37.700
You'll have to find
a way to forgive George.

22:37.767 --> 22:40.500
I will forgive him.
It will just take time.

22:41.233 --> 22:43.500
A little cheesecake wouldn't hurt, either.

22:45.467 --> 22:49.500
You know, Ma, I hate to admit it.
I had fun today.

22:49.567 --> 22:53.667
I'm glad to hear that, because the shady
pines circus is coming up.

22:55.633 --> 22:57.367
You're not afraid of fire, are you?

23:04.767 --> 23:06.233
You son of a...

23:08.800 --> 23:12.300
You put me through all this,
and I could've had Andy Rooney.

23:24.633 --> 23:28.967
