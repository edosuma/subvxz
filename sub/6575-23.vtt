17:38.475 --> 17:40.067
I think it's a wonderful idea.

17:40.243 --> 17:42.336
RED TORNADO:
Your approval is appreciated.

17:42.512 --> 17:48.075
But your presence is uninvited.
Is this a sign of disrespect?

17:48.251 --> 17:49.843
- Curiosity.
- Boredom.

17:50.019 --> 17:52.681
You know, he's cute.

17:52.856 --> 17:55.154
But if the goal is human interaction...

Unh!

18:18.748 --> 18:19.942
Unh!

18:20.884 --> 18:24.445
Aqualad and I found the tracer on a
caboose, and I don't mean Cheshire's.

18:24.621 --> 18:26.816
- She must have ditched it.
- Yeah, figured.

18:26.990 --> 18:28.958
Wait. Then how did you and Red
end up here?

Don't be absurd.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.773
With what we've created tonight,
I could...

18:48.945 --> 18:51.436
Why waste such power on her?

18:51.614 --> 18:54.879
Do as she says. Freeze.

19:05.295 --> 19:06.728
SPORTSMASTER:
Unh!

19:17.607 --> 19:20.770
Let me be clear. We failed.

19:20.944 --> 19:24.675
Though the Injustice League is in custody,
their allies still scheme...

19:24.848 --> 19:27.043
...and we have learned nothing
of their plans.

19:27.217 --> 19:29.310
- Gee, I wonder why.
- Hey.

19:29.485 --> 19:32.818
Who found out Sportsmaster
was working for Brain, Klarion and?

19:32.989 --> 19:36.447
Yeah, great intel. Except Ivo's
been in Belle Reve the whole time.

19:36.626 --> 19:38.093

Well, I enjoyed my sabbatical.

Thanks for filling in.

It's my pleasure.

You know, I'm getting pretty tired
of you dumping on her.

19:51.374 --> 19:53.308
Her tracer. So? Cheshire ditched it.

19:53.476 --> 19:57.810
No. Artemis ditched that
to send us on a wild goose chase.

19:57.981 --> 19:59.642
She put this one on Cheshire.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.210
Artemis?

20:02.385 --> 20:05.081
Are you that freaked out
about Arrow joining the team...

20:05.255 --> 20:08.986
...you had to prove yourself
by bringing down the bad guys solo?

Well, nice going.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.902
What you proved
is that you're insecure and selfish.

20:20.069 --> 20:21.331
Keep the sai.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.506
This is the right souvenir
for the mission.

20:27.510 --> 20:30.638
- So how will you betray us next time?
- Enough.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.805
If making a mistake was a betrayal,
we would all be traitors.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.008
I must report to Batman.

The rest of you, get some sleep.

Shh. We wouldn't want to upset your mother.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.006
What are you doing here?

21:04.180 --> 21:08.742
Just curious to hear
how your little team took their defeat.

21:08.918 --> 21:11.250
Blamed you, didn't they?

21:12.755 --> 21:15.986
Will they keep you around
now that Red Arrow has joined up?

21:16.159 --> 21:21.119
And what if they learned the truth about the
family ties you've worked so hard to hide?

21:21.297 --> 21:23.765
Would they ever trust you again?

21:25.368 --> 21:29.862
Thanks for the pep talk, Dad. We should
have these family reunions more often.

You tried, baby girl.

You can fight Jade, you can fight me...
