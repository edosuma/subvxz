07:54.805 --> 07:56.981
No, it is.

07:57.025 --> 07:58.983
From someone who knows.

07:59.027 --> 08:02.596
What? What the fuck?

08:02.639 --> 08:04.554
It says, "Dear neighbor.

08:04.598 --> 08:06.556
"I noticed packing peanuts
blowing out of your trash.

08:06.600 --> 08:10.212
If you choose to trash them,
at least close the lid."

08:10.255 --> 08:12.083
What? No. Yeah,
I'm reading a note

08:12.127 --> 08:13.998
from a neighbor about the...

08:14.042 --> 08:17.611
"Bad for the environment."
"Act responsibly." [mutters]

08:17.654 --> 08:20.701
"Packing peanuts
should be recycled."

08:20.744 --> 08:24.661
Signed "The Observer."
What the...

08:24.705 --> 08:26.576
I got to go.

08:26.620 --> 08:30.972
Uh, yeah, thank you for calling,
and I'll talk to you later.

08:31.015 --> 08:33.975
The Observer.
What the fuck is...?

08:42.810 --> 08:44.507
Fuck!

08:44.551 --> 08:46.988
[quietly]
Fuck.

08:47.031 --> 08:49.556
Fuck me.

08:49.599 --> 08:51.775
Oh.

08:51.819 --> 08:53.385
[Benny laughs]

08:53.429 --> 08:55.083
Chuck, it tickles.

08:55.126 --> 08:56.606
All right, just relax.

08:56.650 --> 08:58.434
-[laughs]
-All right.

08:58.477 --> 09:00.131
I mean, this looks exactly
how it did before.

09:00.175 --> 09:01.829
-It's just now
there's peanut butter.
-Yeah.

09:01.872 --> 09:04.179
Okay, that's why I told you
to put olive oil first.

09:04.222 --> 09:05.920
-I didn't want to get the grease
on my skin.
-[phone buzzes]

09:05.963 --> 09:07.704
Grease on your skin?
I got gum

09:07.748 --> 09:09.010
and peanut butter
shoved up my ass.

09:09.053 --> 09:10.707
"Parking now"?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.579
-Come on!
-All right, can we get...
do this faster?

09:12.622 --> 09:14.493
Can I, like, just cut out
the fucking hair

09:14.537 --> 09:16.757
-with, like...?
-Chuck, you're not cutting
my ass hair out.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.673
-Why? What do you need it for?
-I-- Chuck, I don't know.

09:19.716 --> 09:21.631
No one needs asshole hair.
That's why women...

09:21.675 --> 09:23.677
go to their, uh...

09:23.720 --> 09:25.853
-Where do you keep the scissors?
-Chuck, it's in the top drawer.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.942
Over there. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.205
-Okay.
-Chuck.

09:30.248 --> 09:32.686
Chuck. Yeah, give me a...

09:32.729 --> 09:34.209
Okay. All right.

09:34.252 --> 09:35.689
How's this for an angle?

09:35.732 --> 09:38.779
-Chuck, this is so avant-garde.
-One. Two.

09:38.822 --> 09:39.997

-Oh.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.520

-Chuck.

09:41.564 --> 09:43.305
Hey, Chuck,
what do you think about this?

09:43.348 --> 09:45.220
This is the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen in my life.

09:45.263 --> 09:46.700
Chuck, what are you talking
about? That's incredible.

09:46.743 --> 09:49.267
-[knocking]
-Chuck.
-All right.

09:49.311 --> 09:51.400
-That's more beautiful
than your cock.
-All right. They're here, Chuck.

09:51.443 --> 09:53.663
-They're here.
-Chuck, what are you doing?
Don't throw that away.

09:53.707 --> 09:56.144
What are you talking about,
Chuck? Clean yourself up.

09:56.187 --> 09:58.276
-Coming!
-Big deal, Chuck.

10:05.283 --> 10:06.937
Yo!

10:06.981 --> 10:08.939
House so big it took three days
to answer the door, huh?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.941
-What up, what up?
-Hey, them overalls crazy.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.856
-Yeah, they're Benny's.
I slept...
-Hey, this my nigga Tone.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.336
-What's up, Tone?
-What's up, man?
Heard a lot about you, man.

10:14.379 --> 10:16.555
Yeah, okay.
Good to meet you, too. Wow.

10:16.599 --> 10:19.036
GATA:
Man, look at the décor.
This spot is sick.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.039
Yo! What up, guys? Oh, baby.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.825
Come over here. Both you guys,
come give me a hug.

10:24.868 --> 10:26.522
-You crazy, fool.
What's good, though, bro?
-Bro.

10:26.565 --> 10:28.698
-Oh, okay.
-Y'all been eating
peanut butter?

10:28.742 --> 10:31.179

DAVE: Okay. Buffalo wings
and a grilled chicken sandwich.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.745
-Got it.
-[sighs] That's crazy.

11:15.789 --> 11:17.442
Benny really doing his thing
out here, man.

But let me get the sauce
from the wings

11:20.141 --> 11:21.577
On the-- Okay.

a way I can do that

-in the Postmates interface.
-GATA: Damn.

11:26.843 --> 11:29.106
This shit crazy, bro.
Look at all this soda, bro.

11:29.150 --> 11:30.934
-It's like diabetes central
right here.
-Oh, Gata,

11:30.978 --> 11:33.284
don't post any of that. He can't
be seen with all that plastic.

11:33.328 --> 11:34.677
-He's on, like,
an environmental charity board.
-What you mean?

11:34.721 --> 11:36.592
It's more plastic
to recycle, bro.

11:36.635 --> 11:38.681
-Come on, man.
-Yeah, it's fine, Chuck.

11:38.725 --> 11:41.075
-More plastic...
-GATA: Who the fuck is Chuck?
-What do you mean?

11:41.118 --> 11:43.294
That's Chuck. Hey, Chuck.
How you doing?

GATA:
Y'all got secret nicknames?
What the fuck?

11:45.427 --> 11:47.646
-What y'all fools
been doing today, though?
-Oh, you know,

11:47.690 --> 11:50.475
Chuck wanted to wake up early
and go swimming,

11:50.519 --> 11:51.825
so we went outside.

11:51.868 --> 11:53.870
And we got this new little game
we play.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.959
It's called shape-shifting,
and it's like,

11:56.003 --> 11:58.614
kind of like he sits naked
and he, like, goes like this.

11:58.657 --> 12:02.226
And then I get to, like,
ripple the waves underwater

12:02.270 --> 12:03.967
and it flows against your penis
and makes you hard.

12:04.011 --> 12:05.099
It's amazing.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.797
That's not, uh...

12:07.841 --> 12:09.059
Gata, what do you want to eat?

12:09.103 --> 12:10.800
Uh, let me get a burger.
No tomatoes.

12:10.844 --> 12:12.106
Hey, you know, this fool Benny
got all, like,

12:12.149 --> 12:13.716
the Top 40 smashes, nigga.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.196
Yeah, I can see that shit.

12:15.239 --> 12:17.111
Heard y'all and Gata
been making them hits.

I can't wait to hear
them joints.

Hey, bro, relax, man.
I'm trying to...

12:19.940 --> 12:21.289
You know, we smoking right now.

12:21.332 --> 12:23.508
-What are you... Stop.
-Come on, man.

12:23.552 --> 12:25.728
You just running up on this
nigga's nice-ass table, bro?

12:25.772 --> 12:26.729
What you wanted me to do?

12:26.773 --> 12:27.861
D-Do you guys want to

12:27.904 --> 12:29.166
smoke the weed outside?

12:29.210 --> 12:31.081
There's a pool.
It's pretty nice.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.388
Oh, yeah, I'm trying to see
the rest of the crib, bro.

12:33.431 --> 12:34.781
Let's do it. Ah.

12:34.824 --> 12:36.826
Chuck, what the hell's wrong
with you?

12:36.870 --> 12:38.915
-Why are you acting so weird?
-I'm not acting weird.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.525
You got to understand, the way
that we act is very weird,

12:40.569 --> 12:41.875
and they're not used to it,
so, like...

12:41.918 --> 12:44.268
Why can't you just
act like yourself?

12:44.312 --> 12:47.141
I am. I'm just saying, like,
Gata's old-school.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.969
Old-school?
What are you talking about?

12:49.012 --> 12:50.666
Like, he's not gonna get it.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.537
Like, I don't want to make him
feel uncomfortable.

12:52.581 --> 12:54.365
Man, what I need to go to the
high school reunion for, bro?

12:54.409 --> 12:56.106
I see them online
every day on IG

12:56.150 --> 12:57.455
not doing shit, bro.

12:57.499 --> 12:58.326
They don't even probably
be taking care

12:58.369 --> 12:59.675
of their kids, bro.

12:59.718 --> 13:01.242
[chuckles]
Wait till you got kids.

13:01.285 --> 13:02.852
Trust me. Like, you got
to know your audience.

13:02.896 --> 13:04.201
Like, you need to cool it
on the Chuck and the...

13:04.245 --> 13:05.289
-all the-- okay?
-All right, fine, fine.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.422
Okay.
How's your butt?

13:07.465 --> 13:09.032
It doesn't feel good.

When's the last time
you went fishing?

Shit, I think it was
with your ass.

13:12.296 --> 13:13.907
Hey, guys, you know
right before you got here,

13:13.950 --> 13:16.561
me and Dave were hanging out,
and he took a wad of gum

13:16.605 --> 13:18.172
and shoved it up my asshole,

13:18.215 --> 13:19.826
and I tried to blow bubbles out
with a fart.

13:19.869 --> 13:22.132
Relax, man. I ain't trying
to hear that shit.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.481
Uh, you guys think Giannis
is staying in Milwaukee

13:23.525 --> 13:24.831
for his whole career?

13:24.874 --> 13:26.006
-Oh, he...
-Wait, wait.

13:26.049 --> 13:27.442
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:27.485 --> 13:29.226
You actually care
that we talk like this?

13:29.270 --> 13:30.880
I told you, Gata does not like
the gay stuff,

13:30.924 --> 13:31.968
so just fucking stop.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.448
Y'all are gay?

13:33.491 --> 13:35.754
-N-No, no.
-No.

13:35.798 --> 13:37.582
Y'all could be homosexual
all y'all want,

13:37.626 --> 13:39.454
but I ain't trying to hear about
no gum in the ass. Real shit.

13:39.497 --> 13:42.631
You guys have never seen
each other's assholes before?

13:42.674 --> 13:44.938
-Oh, no, man. Come on.
-No. What the fuck?

13:44.981 --> 13:48.071
Gata, you've never just,
like, imagined, like,

13:48.115 --> 13:50.334
what Tone's cock
could look like?

13:52.162 --> 13:53.598
Y'all are crazy.

13:53.642 --> 13:54.948
Just so you guys are aware,
he's not meaning

13:54.991 --> 13:56.732
sexually in any way.

13:56.775 --> 13:58.560
He means, like, in terms
of it being, like, fun.

13:58.603 --> 13:59.909
-Yeah, yeah, it's...
-It's, like, funny.

13:59.953 --> 14:01.171
No, no, it's like just...
it's funny.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.043
It's like, it's not even--

14:03.086 --> 14:04.827
Like, we're not gay,
we're just, like...

14:04.871 --> 14:07.786
Rich, white, and ain't got
shit else to do.

14:07.830 --> 14:09.876
-Rich? White?
-I'm not even that rich.

14:09.919 --> 14:12.791
Okay, cut the shit, Gata,
right now.

14:12.835 --> 14:14.228
In your house, you walk in.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.577
You're whole family's tied up.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.100
They got your mom going,
"Ooh! Ooh!"

14:17.144 --> 14:19.450
And they say they're gonna
spray 'em all down

14:19.494 --> 14:20.843
unless you suck his dick.

14:20.887 --> 14:22.279
The guy with the gun.
You doing it?

14:22.323 --> 14:24.151
Hell no. Everybody
going to heaven, bro.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.631
Stop trying to be a tough guy.
Okay, Gata, do you love Tone?

14:26.675 --> 14:28.851
-Of course. That's my nigga.
-You don't show
your friends love?

14:28.895 --> 14:31.027
-I show Dave love.
I give him a nice little...
-Not right now. Stop.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.986
Get off. Stop.
Get off.

14:33.029 --> 14:36.467
Bro, I do show my friends love.
I just gave this nigga Tone

14:36.511 --> 14:39.340
a skateboard to give to his son
to go back to school with.

14:39.383 --> 14:40.515
A bunch of free clothes
and shit.

14:40.558 --> 14:42.038
But all this fugazi shit, man,

14:42.082 --> 14:43.735
I ain't trying to see
this shit, bro.

14:43.779 --> 14:45.172
-You see what they be on?
-Looks like I'm the winner.

14:45.215 --> 14:46.956
-[Dave laughs]
-You like the masculinity?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.349
I'm fucking you now.

14:48.392 --> 14:50.568
-Oh, shit.
-[Dave grunts]

14:50.612 --> 14:53.615
-Chuck, that was so homoerotic.
-I hated it.

14:53.658 --> 14:54.616
You know why y'all like playing
this little

14:54.659 --> 14:56.009
gay chicken game, right?

14:56.052 --> 14:57.967
Chicken?

14:58.011 --> 14:59.360
'Cause y'all ain't never had
to deal with the consequences

14:59.403 --> 15:00.796
of the way y'all are.

15:00.839 --> 15:02.711
So y'all just run around
this big-ass house

15:02.754 --> 15:04.234
-looking for ways to flirt
with some shit.
-No, no, no.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.106
We're just--
It's like-- It's like bromance.

15:06.149 --> 15:07.542
-Like a bromance movie.
-DAVE: Yes.

15:07.585 --> 15:09.979
You ever seen
a Black bromance movie?

15:10.023 --> 15:11.807
BENNY:
Uh...

15:11.850 --> 15:13.983
[quietly]:
Black bromance...

15:14.027 --> 15:16.333
-Black bromance...
-Exactly.

15:16.377 --> 15:19.206
-Uh, Rush Hour?
-Yeah, Rush hour?

15:19.249 --> 15:21.991
-He was Asian.
-That's a Black dude
and an Asian guy, bro.

15:22.035 --> 15:24.211
-Yeah, but Chris Tucker.
-Asian and a Black guy.

15:24.254 --> 15:25.995
Yeah, but the movie was
more Black-themed, I think,

15:26.039 --> 15:28.780
even though it was set
in... Asia?

15:28.824 --> 15:31.131
Moonlight?
What about Moonlight?

15:31.174 --> 15:32.828
Best Picture-winning Moonlight.

15:32.871 --> 15:35.178
That wasn't a bromance movie.
That was just a romance.

15:35.222 --> 15:36.701
-Yeah.
-That's true.

15:36.745 --> 15:39.269
Why aren't there any
Black bromance movies?

15:39.313 --> 15:40.967
I'm not about to unpack
400 years of Mandingoshit

15:41.010 --> 15:42.446
for y'all, too.

15:42.490 --> 15:43.795
400 years? Mandingo?

15:43.839 --> 15:45.493
That guy, the porn star,
is, like, 40.

15:45.536 --> 15:48.322
Bro, regardless, Black people,
we gonna get judged, bro,

15:48.365 --> 15:49.714
if we're not winning
championships

15:49.758 --> 15:51.455
or rapping about
being the shit, period.

15:51.499 --> 15:53.022
That's just how it is.

15:54.937 --> 15:57.418
-That white privilege
kicking in, huh?
-Well...

15:57.461 --> 16:00.334
Or maybe you guys are a little
scared of something like this.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.770
And the only way to prove it
is if you look

16:01.813 --> 16:03.641
-at my asshole right now.
-Your asshole?!

16:03.685 --> 16:05.600
-Yep, my asshole.
-Oh, hell...

16:05.643 --> 16:07.341
I'm an EMT, so if seeing
a butthole

16:07.384 --> 16:09.430
is the worst part of my day,
it's a good day.

16:09.473 --> 16:11.127
Y'all got to start setting
more boundaries...

16:11.171 --> 16:12.041
-Oh, you're an EMT.
-I'm sorry, dude, I, I'm sorry.

16:12.085 --> 16:14.043
You're a tough guy, huh?

16:14.087 --> 16:15.827
-Gata, I'm sorry.
-GATA: Come on, man.
-BENNY: A real tough guy.

16:15.871 --> 16:17.699
You want me to give you
the whole shebang right now?

16:17.742 --> 16:19.440
-I don't give a fuck.
-Oh, you don't give a fuck?

16:19.483 --> 16:20.441
I don't give two shits.

16:20.484 --> 16:21.877
All right, Chuck, he says

16:21.920 --> 16:23.226
he doesn't give a fuck.
Should I just

16:23.270 --> 16:24.488
-shimmy on down...
-Stop.

16:24.532 --> 16:26.012
...and bring him
to the candy shop,

16:26.055 --> 16:27.622
but give him a little
Hershey squirt, too?

16:27.665 --> 16:31.060
-Wait, wait. That's strange.
-DAVE: What?

16:31.104 --> 16:32.453
-What do you mean?
-Yeah.

16:32.496 --> 16:33.758
No, the-there, come, look.

16:33.802 --> 16:35.456
Yeah, it's a little strange,
huh?

16:35.499 --> 16:37.240
There's gum and peanut butter
in there from earlier.

16:37.284 --> 16:38.981
I knew I smelled peanut butter
earlier, but check it out.

16:39.025 --> 16:40.287
-See, there's something...
-Oh, my God, what is that?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.984
It's like a--
It's like a-a mass.

16:42.028 --> 16:44.508
Chuck, what is it?
There's, like, a lump of flesh.

16:44.552 --> 16:46.728
TONE:
And you know that this skin
can be cancer-prone.

16:46.771 --> 16:48.295
-What is that?
-DAVE: How would I know that?
I had no idea.

16:48.338 --> 16:50.384
My boy know his shit
over there.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.994
-What do you mean, Chuck?
-DAVE: I don't know
what that is.

16:52.038 --> 16:53.952
There's something that
I didn't notice before.

16:53.996 --> 16:55.911
GATA:
We got an emergency call.
My boy, he on his job, look.

16:55.954 --> 16:57.913
Could it be, like, genital
herpes, 'cause...

16:57.956 --> 17:00.046
-It could. It-it could spread.
-Is the anus a genital?

17:00.089 --> 17:01.656
-It's his asshole.
-I know. But is it...?

17:01.699 --> 17:03.397
-[panting]
-Like, one in five people
have...

17:03.440 --> 17:07.096
This is good weed.
Chuck, are you okay?

17:07.140 --> 17:09.142
[breathlessly]:
Chuck...

17:09.185 --> 17:12.449
-Chuck, what's going on?
-Chuck, Chuck,
I don't feel good.

17:12.493 --> 17:14.103
-What do you mean?
-Chuck, Chuck, I think
I'm having a panic attack

17:14.147 --> 17:15.844
-or something.
-Okay.

17:15.887 --> 17:17.759
Uh, just breathe. Do your
little Baruch atah Adonai...

17:17.802 --> 17:19.152
Chuck, it's not like that.

17:19.195 --> 17:20.588
I feel like I'm gonna
fucking die.

17:20.631 --> 17:22.546
DAVE:
Okay. Total anxiety.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.200
Chuck, none of this is real.
You're just...

17:24.244 --> 17:26.420
Tone, if he's having
a panic attack, what do we do?

17:26.463 --> 17:30.119
Man, he should probably start
by stop smoking this gas.

17:30.163 --> 17:31.555
-[laughter]
-Shut the fuck up!

17:31.599 --> 17:33.296
Hey, no, I'm serious, man.

17:33.340 --> 17:35.733
My fucking uncle died
of fucking colon cancer.

17:35.777 --> 17:37.039
Chuck, I have
the best dermatologist

17:37.083 --> 17:38.693
in the entire city,
Dr. Belbin.

17:38.736 --> 17:40.173
I'm gonna get us in.
He's the derm of the stars.

17:40.216 --> 17:41.783
I'm gonna get us in today.

17:41.826 --> 17:43.001
I'm about to take a flick
right now for the Gram.

17:43.045 --> 17:44.351
Gata, what are you doing?

17:44.394 --> 17:46.918
-Benny's asshole is bleeding!
-Stop.

17:46.962 --> 17:48.181
-I feel like I'm gonna die.
-You're not dying, Chuck.

17:48.224 --> 17:49.225
-You gonna be good, bro.
-You get it?

18:00.018 --> 18:01.672
[computer chiming]

18:10.028 --> 18:11.943
What the fuck?

18:17.601 --> 18:19.212
Hey!

18:20.213 --> 18:21.562
[mutters]

18:23.303 --> 18:24.956
Hey!

18:28.873 --> 18:30.919
Fuck him.

18:35.576 --> 18:38.405
I just put the cans out.
Feel free to toss that in there.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.581
No, I would never put shit
in another man's trash.

18:40.624 --> 18:42.191
Some asshole just
did that to me.

18:42.235 --> 18:43.192
That's why I'm out here
looking for him right now

18:43.236 --> 18:44.106
to tell him he's an asshole.

18:44.150 --> 18:45.934
Oh, uh, wow. Okay.

18:45.977 --> 18:47.675
Well, you know, he probably just
didn't want to walk around

18:47.718 --> 18:49.372
with a bag of dog shit
in his hand, right?

18:49.416 --> 18:52.680
I think everyone should
take care of their own shit.

18:52.723 --> 18:53.942
It's not too much to ask.

18:53.985 --> 18:56.205
I-I'm with you, brother,
you know.

18:56.249 --> 18:58.729
But like they say,
you can either be right

18:58.773 --> 19:00.078
or you can be happy.

19:00.122 --> 19:02.516
I've never heard that, ever.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.735
If it gets under your skin,
you can just write a note.

19:08.478 --> 19:10.045
Write a note?

19:10.088 --> 19:13.396
Yeah. You know,
if it's an issue.

19:13.440 --> 19:17.879
Are... Are you
The Observer?

19:17.922 --> 19:19.968
-No.
-No?

19:20.011 --> 19:21.535
Because wouldn't a normal person
just say, "What's The Observer?

19:21.578 --> 19:22.753
I don't know what that is,
I've never heard of it"?

19:22.797 --> 19:23.928
You just said no.

19:23.972 --> 19:26.104
-I mean, I-I...
-You what?

19:26.148 --> 19:28.716
You what? You are.
You are! [laughs]

19:28.759 --> 19:32.241
This is good.
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:32.285 --> 19:35.026
take a look at this
piece of shit, Internet.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.506
This man lives
in my neighborhood

19:36.550 --> 19:37.899
and has been harassing me

19:37.942 --> 19:39.683
by leaving notes
on my residence

19:39.727 --> 19:43.209
about packing peanuts being
in the wrong fucking bin.

19:43.252 --> 19:46.124
Like anybody cares at all.
[laughs]

19:46.168 --> 19:49.084
I manage an artist, by the way.
A very famous, very...

19:49.127 --> 19:51.434
soon-to-be very famous artist.
Hundreds of thousands

19:51.478 --> 19:52.870
of followers already
on the Internet.

19:52.914 --> 19:54.220
They're all gonna see this
on his page.

19:54.263 --> 19:55.482
They're gonna know
where you live,

19:55.525 --> 19:57.223
they'll know the neighborhood,

19:57.266 --> 19:59.355
and you're probably gonna
get fired from your job, dork.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.053
-Why are you filming me?
-Why am I filming?

20:02.097 --> 20:03.533
Why would you put notes
on someone's trash?

20:03.577 --> 20:05.100
Who the fuck does that, dude?

20:05.143 --> 20:06.580
I don't know what
you're talking about,

20:06.623 --> 20:08.190
but maybe they just wanted
to let you know

20:08.234 --> 20:09.974
in a... in a friendly way
how to properly dispose

20:10.018 --> 20:11.280
of popcorn peanuts.

20:11.324 --> 20:13.326
-Ah. [laughs]
-I mean, do you care

20:13.369 --> 20:14.588
about the environment?

20:15.589 --> 20:17.373
Yes. Yes, I do.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.157
So, there you go.
I don't understand

20:19.201 --> 20:21.072
-why you're filming me.
-And you know what?

20:21.116 --> 20:22.813
No one cares.
Nobody cares what you think.

20:22.857 --> 20:24.206
That's the point. That's why
I'm filming you right now.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.816
Because no one fucking cares.

20:25.860 --> 20:29.429
You're filming me
because no one cares?

20:31.474 --> 20:34.085
[phone beeps]

20:34.129 --> 20:37.175
[laughs airily]

20:38.960 --> 20:41.005
You've been observed,
motherfucker.

20:41.049 --> 20:43.094
[scoffs]

20:44.313 --> 20:46.141
Fucking...

20:50.058 --> 20:52.321
[phone rings]

20:52.365 --> 20:53.975
SUSAN:
How's your back?

20:54.018 --> 20:55.629
Oh, my God, it's like, I thought

20:55.672 --> 20:57.370
the doxycycline would do more
than the Accutane,

20:57.413 --> 21:00.286
but, like, it's just making me
nauseous half the time.

21:00.329 --> 21:02.070
Well, don't forget
to take it with food.

21:02.113 --> 21:03.854
I know. I keep forgetting
I have to eat with it.

21:03.898 --> 21:05.900
Um, so much to fill out.

21:05.943 --> 21:08.119
Chuck, what kind
of health insurance do you have?

21:08.163 --> 21:10.165
I don't... I don't have any.

21:10.208 --> 21:12.385
I brought... I brought this.

21:12.428 --> 21:16.084
Uh, we can figure it out after.

21:16.127 --> 21:17.564
Is it... is it enough?

21:17.607 --> 21:20.131
I don't think that's how
the medical system works.

21:20.175 --> 21:21.611
Chuck, what world
do you live in, Chuck?

21:21.655 --> 21:23.396
SUSAN:
He can actually go back now.

21:23.439 --> 21:25.441
Okay, Chuck, they're ready
to take you. Good luck, Chuck.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.790
-I'm so scared.
-Don't be scared.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.270
You're gonna be fine.
You got it.

21:28.314 --> 21:29.793
They're gonna...
Dr. Belbin's gonna do it.

21:29.837 --> 21:31.273
Go to her. Okay.

21:31.317 --> 21:33.319
I'll fill out
all your stuff, Chuck.

21:33.362 --> 21:35.495
GATA:
Man, I'll bet you this is

21:35.538 --> 21:37.366
where George Clooney got his
titties done, come out looking

21:37.410 --> 21:39.716
-like Batman.
-TONE: You think they got
a payment plan?

21:39.760 --> 21:41.501
Ally Wernick was here?

21:41.544 --> 21:43.938
I can't say.

21:43.981 --> 21:46.854
Yeah, that's
how she writes her name.

21:46.897 --> 21:48.769
-That's...
-GATA: Man, this hundred
kind of faded.

21:48.812 --> 21:50.553
You think I could change this
hundred to, like, a private jet

21:50.597 --> 21:52.076
-or something?
-I don't think
they do edits over here.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.078
It's my skin, bro,
it's a dermatologist.

21:54.122 --> 21:55.993
But it's a different type--
they don't take the skin...

21:56.037 --> 21:57.691
You know, Ally would always say
dermatology wasn't even real.

21:57.734 --> 22:00.346
And she's using my name
to get into my fucking derm?

22:00.389 --> 22:02.130
-Huh?
-You know what?

22:02.173 --> 22:04.524
I'm giving this girl
a phone call right now.

22:04.567 --> 22:06.613
Enough is enough-- you can't
go the rest of your life

22:06.656 --> 22:09.267
-without talking to me.
It's ridiculous.
-That motherfucker's cold.

reached the voice mail box...
-You know they gonna

22:10.878 --> 22:12.749

All right, fine,
you're getting a text.

She didn't answer?

Green?

22:19.582 --> 22:22.933
What does this mean when...
it was always blue in the past?

22:22.977 --> 22:25.719
Aw, hell no-- she blocked you.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.851
-That's scandalous, dawg.
-She blocked me?!

22:27.895 --> 22:30.463
You really dealing
with that right now, bro?

22:30.506 --> 22:32.378
Why would she...?
What the fuck happened?

22:32.421 --> 22:34.249
It's all good, LD.

22:34.292 --> 22:35.729
You ain't got to worry
about it, though, bro,

'cause at the end of the day,
I love you, bro.

22:37.034 --> 22:38.645
I got you, LD.

22:38.688 --> 22:40.168
-I know we at a dermatologist.
-I love you... yeah.

22:40.211 --> 22:41.430
But don't let it get
under your skin, bro.

I love you, too, Gata.

How's it going over there?

23:19.120 --> 23:20.600
It's pretty good, you know?

23:20.643 --> 23:22.210
It's going.

23:23.341 --> 23:25.431
I was just calling to...

23:25.474 --> 23:27.650
wish you a happy birthday.

23:27.694 --> 23:29.478
I know it's late,
I just, you know,

23:29.522 --> 23:32.481
I like avoiding the morning
rush, and I know midday

23:32.525 --> 23:34.309
is when all the other guys
come along, and I want to be

23:34.352 --> 23:35.745
the guy that really
caps it all off

23:35.789 --> 23:37.486
-for you, so...
-Yeah, man.

23:37.530 --> 23:40.010
I appreciate it,
I appreciate it, big dog.

23:40.054 --> 23:41.708
Did you do anything fun today?

23:41.751 --> 23:43.144
I'm sorry that
I haven't even been home.

I, uh, I was with Benny,
I slept there.

so much on music.

Yeah, no, no, it was good--
it was a great day, man.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.415
I went running,
took a long, nice run.

23:53.459 --> 23:55.069

that was...

that was nice, man.

a day off, but,

how it goes, man.

24:08.952 --> 24:11.041
Well, I'm happy
you had a great day.

24:11.085 --> 24:14.567
And I look forward to coming
back home and hugging you.

24:14.610 --> 24:16.569
Thank you, man,
thank you, I'm, uh...

24:16.612 --> 24:18.440
Long day, long birthday day,

24:18.484 --> 24:20.486
so I'm, I think I'm gonna
hit the hay, man, I'm tired.

24:20.529 --> 24:22.618
Okay, I love you, man.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.446
[clucks tongue]
Thanks, man.

24:24.490 --> 24:26.492
[line beeping]

24:28.755 --> 24:30.800
[phone chimes]

24:38.025 --> 24:40.114
[knocking]

24:56.304 --> 24:57.827
[chuckles]

24:57.871 --> 24:59.481
[laughing]:
Hi.

24:59.525 --> 25:02.092
Did you block me?

25:02.136 --> 25:04.138
No.

25:04.181 --> 25:06.793
My phone has been off
the whole day.

25:06.836 --> 25:08.490
Just off.

25:08.534 --> 25:10.884
-Oh.
-[sputters]

25:10.927 --> 25:12.538
Is everything all right?

25:12.581 --> 25:14.931
Yes.

25:14.975 --> 25:17.238
And I did think
about blocking you.

25:17.281 --> 25:19.501
[singsongy]:
But I didn't.

25:19.545 --> 25:21.808
[giggling]

25:21.851 --> 25:24.724
-Are-are you okay?
-I'm great.

25:24.767 --> 25:26.464
I'm-- look.

25:26.508 --> 25:28.249
[pills rattling]

25:28.292 --> 25:31.121
I'm on painkillers.

25:31.165 --> 25:32.514
DAVE:
Oxycodone?

25:32.558 --> 25:34.211
Oh, man, this is,
like, really ravaging

25:34.255 --> 25:36.170
lower middle-class America
right now.

25:36.213 --> 25:38.912
-Like, I would not...
-I'm not abusing pills, Dave.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.349
Certainly not over you.

25:41.392 --> 25:43.264
I had a surgery.

25:43.307 --> 25:45.396
Like an adult.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.137
What-what did you have
surgery on?

25:47.181 --> 25:49.183
I had my mole removed
on my back.

25:49.226 --> 25:50.750
-The General?!

25:50.793 --> 25:52.229
[laughs]:
The General, yeah.

25:52.273 --> 25:53.579
-He's gone?
-Yeah.

25:53.622 --> 25:55.232
What about the Lieutenants?

25:55.276 --> 25:57.408
The Lieutenants were unharmed.
He-- Dr. Belbin said

25:57.452 --> 25:59.106
that they weren't irregular,
but then the General

25:59.149 --> 26:02.544
got dishonorably discharged.

26:02.588 --> 26:04.502
That's a twist-off.

26:04.546 --> 26:06.548
-Oh.
-I also don't think we need
to be drinking, right?

26:06.592 --> 26:09.812
You're on oxys
and I'm on doxycycline for...

26:09.856 --> 26:11.640
If I drank,
my appendix would explode.

26:11.684 --> 26:13.424
I did-- I, like,
walked in there to get--

26:13.468 --> 26:15.165
to be polite, so it's-- yeah.

26:15.209 --> 26:16.645
This feels...

26:16.689 --> 26:18.342
We'll just leave that there.

26:18.386 --> 26:20.214
Uh...

26:21.563 --> 26:23.652
Uh... Dr. Belbin.

26:23.696 --> 26:26.524
-You... my doctor.
-[laughing]

26:26.568 --> 26:29.005
You, uh, used my name to get in?

26:29.049 --> 26:31.399
Yes.

26:31.442 --> 26:33.314
Just 'cause I know he's, like,
a dermatologist of the...

26:33.357 --> 26:34.881
stars.

26:34.924 --> 26:37.579
[laughing]:
This is so funny.

26:37.623 --> 26:39.450
What an insane thing to say!

26:39.494 --> 26:40.669
I know.

26:40.713 --> 26:42.976
I only bring it up, 'cause, um,

26:43.019 --> 26:44.804
obviously we haven't, like,

26:44.847 --> 26:46.719
been in each other's lives
at all.

26:46.762 --> 26:49.025
And when I saw that you

26:49.069 --> 26:50.940
went there, it kind of, like,

26:50.984 --> 26:53.290
made me feel used.

26:53.334 --> 26:56.511
Is-is going to your doctor a...

26:56.554 --> 26:59.906
mean thing to do?

27:01.385 --> 27:03.518
It's not.

27:03.561 --> 27:05.651
-I think I'm reaching.
-[groans]

27:05.694 --> 27:09.089
As you are right now-- what are
you trying to achieve right now?

27:09.132 --> 27:11.308
I have to change...

27:11.352 --> 27:13.093
my bandage on my back,
and it's...

27:13.136 --> 27:15.095
hard to reach.

27:15.138 --> 27:17.967
Do you need a hand?

27:18.011 --> 27:20.056
Could you...?

27:22.798 --> 27:24.931
That's a yes?

27:24.974 --> 27:26.715
Oh, okay.

27:26.759 --> 27:28.848
-Okay.
-Here we go.

27:28.891 --> 27:30.545
Wash your hands
so that it doesn't get

27:30.588 --> 27:32.199
sour cream and onion-y.

27:32.242 --> 27:34.984
I'll go here,
then you go on this part.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.638
-Okay.
-[Ally laughing]

27:36.682 --> 27:38.684
[winces]

27:39.989 --> 27:42.383
-Okay.
-Oh.

27:42.426 --> 27:45.734
Why, why are you being weird?

27:45.778 --> 27:48.171
Just your breasts are exposed.

27:48.215 --> 27:50.957
Oh... [sputters]
Are you serious?!

27:51.000 --> 27:53.524
You've seen these
a million times!

27:53.568 --> 27:56.223
I know, I just don't know
if I should...

27:56.266 --> 27:57.746
Just don't look at them.

27:57.790 --> 27:59.052
-I won't look at them.
-Don't look at them.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.575
-I'm a pro.
-You got...

28:00.618 --> 28:02.185
Here I come. What breasts?

28:02.229 --> 28:03.534
-[laughs]
-No problem.

28:03.578 --> 28:05.188
Okay, now you dress the wound.

28:05.232 --> 28:07.364
Put this wound in a tux.

28:07.408 --> 28:08.365
[Ally laughs]

28:08.409 --> 28:09.889
Okay.

28:09.932 --> 28:11.325
Uh, can I just pull
your hair back?

28:11.368 --> 28:13.153
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

28:13.196 --> 28:16.025
Go for it.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.853
It's blonde.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.507
Mm-hmm.

28:19.550 --> 28:21.422
That's cool.

28:22.728 --> 28:25.295
I miss the General.

28:25.339 --> 28:26.732
Does this, does this hurt?

28:26.775 --> 28:29.212
No, nothing hurts anymore.

28:29.256 --> 28:31.214
Hmm.

28:31.258 --> 28:34.043
Now you dab it with
the cotton ball, make it nice.

28:34.087 --> 28:37.003
-This okay?
-Mm-hmm.

28:40.397 --> 28:42.399
I'm still sad at you,

28:42.443 --> 28:44.010
you know?

28:45.881 --> 28:47.927
I know.

28:50.364 --> 28:52.801
I...

28:52.845 --> 28:54.281
[gulps]

28:54.324 --> 28:55.804
[Dave groans]

28:55.848 --> 28:57.806

28:57.850 --> 28:59.895
-[retches]
-[Ally gasps]

29:01.375 --> 29:03.594
Oh, fuck. [grunts]

29:03.638 --> 29:05.596
What was that?

29:07.294 --> 29:09.557
Vomit.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.864
It's vomit?

29:11.907 --> 29:14.083
Just a little bit
'cause I'm on doxycycline

29:14.127 --> 29:15.693
now for my skin.
If you don't take food...

29:15.737 --> 29:17.565
Is it in my wound, Dave?

29:19.741 --> 29:20.568
In it?

29:20.611 --> 29:22.570
