OKAY, CHILDREN,
LET'S TAKE OUR SEATS.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.306
THIS MORNING WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A SPECIAL LECTURE

00:40.308 --> 00:43.709
FROM YOUR SCHOOL COUNSELOR,
MR. MACKY.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.743
BOO.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.644
NOW WHO WAS THAT?

00:45.646 --> 00:49.014
THAT IS NOT
APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, OKAY?

00:49.016 --> 00:51.083
I'M SORRY,
MR. MACKY, OKAY?

00:51.085 --> 00:53.852
THAT'S OKAY, JUST DON'T
LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.956
WE WON'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN,
MR. MACKY, OKAY?

00:56.958 --> 00:59.959
OKAY, OKAY,
THAT'S FINE.

00:59.961 --> 01:00.659
OKAY?

01:00.661 --> 01:01.327
OKAY.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.127
( laughing )

01:02.129 --> 01:03.429
NOW AS
YOUR COUNSELOR,

01:03.431 --> 01:06.198
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
ABOUT DRUGS AND ALCOHOL

01:06.200 --> 01:08.400
AND WHY
THEY'RE BAD, OKAY?

01:08.402 --> 01:10.836
SO FIRST OF ALL,
SMOKING'S BAD.

01:10.838 --> 01:14.139
YOU SHOULDN'T SMOKE,
AND ALCOHOL IS BAD.

01:14.141 --> 01:15.841
YOU SHOULDN'T
DRINK ALCOHOL,

01:15.843 --> 01:18.811
AND AS FOR DRUGS,
WELL, DRUGS ARE BAD,

01:18.813 --> 01:20.079
YOU SHOULDN'T
DO DRUGS.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.381
OKAY, NOW THAT ABOUT
WRAPS UP MY INTRODUCTION.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.717
NOW ARE THERE
ANY QUESTIONS?

01:24.719 --> 01:25.451
YES, STAN.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.286
WHY DO DOGS
HAVE COLD NOSES?

01:27.288 --> 01:30.222
UH, WELL,
I'M NOT SURE.

01:30.224 --> 01:30.823
OH.

01:30.825 --> 01:34.259
LET'S FOCUS OUR DISCUSSION
ON MARIJUANA.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.260
MARIJUANA'S BAD

01:35.262 --> 01:38.230
AND IT ALSO HAS A VERY
DISTINCT SMELL, OKAY?

01:38.232 --> 01:40.499
I'M GONNA PASS AROUND
JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT,

01:40.501 --> 01:42.101
AND I WANT YOU ALL
TO TAKE A SMELL

01:42.103 --> 01:45.771
SO YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS
SMOKING MARIJUANA NEAR YOU.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.107
OKAY, JUST TAKE A SMELL,
PASS IT ON,

01:48.109 --> 01:49.708
AND WHEN IT GETS
BACK UP TO ME,

01:49.710 --> 01:51.744
WE'LL FINISH
TALKING ABOUT IT.

01:51.746 --> 01:52.644
IN THE MEANTIME,

01:52.646 --> 01:54.613
I WANT TO GET INTO
ALCOHOL, OKAY?

01:54.615 --> 01:55.981
ALCOHOL IS BAD.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.649
IF YOU DRINK ALCOHOL...

01:57.651 --> 01:59.752
ARE YOU GONNA COME
TO IKE'S PARTY THIS WEEKEND?

01:59.754 --> 02:01.487
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER'S
HAVING A PARTY?

02:01.489 --> 02:02.621
WHY, IS IT
HIS BIRTHDAY?

02:02.623 --> 02:03.789
NO, IT'S HIS<i> BRIS.</i>

02:03.791 --> 02:05.591
WHAT THE HELL'S
A BRIS?

02:05.593 --> 02:07.292
I DON'T KNOW, THERE'S
GONNA BE FOOD AND A BAND.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.094
OH, KICK ASS,
I WANT TO HAVE A BRIS.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.563
...AND SO, THAT'S WHY
ALCOHOL IS BAD.

02:11.565 --> 02:15.467
HAS THAT MARIJUANA MADE IT
BACK UP HERE YET?

02:15.469 --> 02:16.902
NO? OKAY.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.904
LET'S TALK ABOUT LSD.

02:18.906 --> 02:22.007
CHILDREN,
LSD IS BAD.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.409
IT'S A DRUG
MADE FAMOUS

02:23.411 --> 02:25.044
BY JOHN LENNON AND
PAUL McCARTNEY.

02:25.046 --> 02:27.413
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER PRESENTS?

02:27.415 --> 02:28.747
I'M NOT SURE.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.915
DUDE, YOU BETTER
FIND OUT.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.784
BOYS, ARE YOU
PAYING ATTENTION?

02:31.786 --> 02:33.952
SORRY,
MR. MACKY, OKAY?

02:33.954 --> 02:34.686
OKAY.

02:34.688 --> 02:38.357
HAS THAT MARIJUANA
MADE IT AROUND YET?

02:40.227 --> 02:43.462
WHO HAS
THE MARIJUANA NOW?

02:43.564 --> 02:46.231
OKAY, WHOEVER HAS
THE MARIJUANA,

02:46.233 --> 02:50.069
JUST PASS IT UP TO
THE FRONT ROW, OKAY?

02:50.071 --> 02:51.036
UH, OH.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.605
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, YOUNG MAN.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.541
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.843
WHAT COULD HAVE POSSESSED YOU
TO BE SO STUPID?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.711
I'M SORRY,
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.914
SORRY ISN'T GONNA CUT THE CHEESE
THIS TIME, MISTER.

03:01.916 --> 03:05.150
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO SUSPEND YOU FROM SCHOOL.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.251
YOU MEAN
I'M FIRED?

03:06.253 --> 03:08.754
I GUESS THAT'S THE GROWN-UP
WAY TO PUT IT, YES.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.557
BUT IT WAS AN HONEST
ERROR OF JUDGMENT, OKAY?

03:11.559 --> 03:14.526
I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS
IMPORTANT FOR THE KIDS TO KNOW

03:14.528 --> 03:15.994
THE SMELL
OF MARIJUANA.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.696
IT WAS AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT,
MR. MACKY,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.298
BUT I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO
LET YOU GO FOR IT.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.000
WE SEARCHED EACH ONE OF
THOSE KIDS, BUT CAME UP EMPTY.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.102
WE HAD TO
LET THEM GO HOME,

03:23.104 --> 03:25.904
AND ONE OF THEM HAS
HALF OF A LID OF JAMAICAN GRASS

03:25.906 --> 03:26.805
BECAUSE OF YOU!

03:26.807 --> 03:29.041
HOW AM I GONNA
MAKE ENDS MEET?

03:29.043 --> 03:29.775
OKAY?

03:29.777 --> 03:31.643
WHAT WILL I DO
FOR MONEY?

03:31.645 --> 03:32.544
THERE, THERE, NOW,

03:32.546 --> 03:33.812
MAYBE THIS WILL
BLOW OVER SOMEDAY

03:33.814 --> 03:35.314
AND WE CAN GIVE YOU
A JOB AS A JANITOR,

03:35.316 --> 03:38.984
CLEANING UP VOMIT
WITH THAT PINK SAWDUST STUFF.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.287
( sobbing )
OKAY.

03:43.090 --> 03:43.922
AAH!

03:43.924 --> 03:45.991
MAN, THAT SUCKED
GETTING SEARCHED.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.227
YEAH, MY ASS
IS KILLING ME.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.361
WHY DID THEY
SEARCH<i> US</i>?

03:49.363 --> 03:51.396
THAT MARIJUANA NEVER EVEN
MADE IT TO US.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.499
I WONDER
WHO TOOK IT.

03:53.767 --> 03:58.270
( tv )
...and now it's
almost time for...

04:01.275 --> 04:02.307
HELLO THERE,
CHILDREN.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.509
( all together )
HEY, CHEF.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.610
HOW'S IT GOING?

04:04.612 --> 04:05.344
BAD.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.044
WHY BAD?

04:06.046 --> 04:08.013
I HEARD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.949
NONE OF YOU TOOK
THAT NASTY MARIJUANA, DID YOU?

04:10.951 --> 04:12.384
NO, DUDE,
WE NEVER EVEN SAW IT.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.520
OKAY, BECAUSE I JUST
WANT TO TELL YOU

04:14.522 --> 04:16.388
THAT DRUGS ARE BAD!

04:16.390 --> 04:18.957
WE KNOW, WE KNOW,
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.591
RIGHT.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.859
DO YOU KNOW
<i>WHY</i> THEY'RE BAD?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.628
BECAUSE THEY'RE AN ADDICTIVE
SOLUTION TO A GREATER PROBLEM

04:22.630 --> 04:24.663
CAUSING DISEASE OF BOTH
BODY AND MIND WITH CONSEQUENCES

04:24.665 --> 04:26.298
FAR OUTWEIGHING
THEIR SUPPOSED BENEFITS.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.135
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS?

04:30.137 --> 04:30.736
NO.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.938
I KNOW, BECAUSE
IF YOU DO DRUGS,

04:32.940 --> 04:34.473
YOU'RE A HIPPY
AND HIPPIES SUCK.

04:34.475 --> 04:38.010
CHILDREN, THIS IS ALL
I'M GONNA SAY ABOUT DRUGS,

04:38.012 --> 04:39.011
STAY AWAY FROM THEM!

04:39.013 --> 04:41.880
THERE'S A TIME AND A PLACE
FOR EVERYTHING,

04:41.882 --> 04:43.949
AND IT'S CALLED
"COLLEGE".

04:43.951 --> 04:45.551
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

04:45.553 --> 04:46.919
( all together )
DUDE.

04:46.921 --> 04:47.686
OKAY.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.354
ARE YOU GONNA COME TO
IKE'S BRIS?

04:49.356 --> 04:52.024
OH, HELL NO,
I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE THAT.

04:52.026 --> 04:52.925
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:52.927 --> 04:54.626
DON'T YOU BOYS KNOW
WHAT A BRIS IS?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.962
THEY'RE GOING
TO CIRCUMCISE HIM.

04:56.964 --> 04:57.763
WHAT'S THAT?

04:57.765 --> 05:00.399
OH, BOY,
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.166
CHILDREN,

05:01.168 --> 05:04.436
WHAT'S THE ONE THING THAT'S
MORE SACRED TO A MAN

05:04.438 --> 05:06.872
THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE WORLD?

05:06.874 --> 05:08.473
BICYCLES?

05:08.475 --> 05:09.208
HAM?

05:09.210 --> 05:10.776
NO, NOT HAM,
YOU FAT<i>!@#$%.</i>

05:10.778 --> 05:11.944
SCREW YOU,
IT'S HAM, ISN'T IT?

05:11.946 --> 05:16.448
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF A MAN'S BODY.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.749
YOUR HEART?

05:17.751 --> 05:19.017
YOUR EYES.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.719
( mumbling )

05:20.721 --> 05:21.486
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.689
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
CALL IT A "PENIS"!

05:23.691 --> 05:26.225
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO CALL IT A "FIREMAN".

05:26.227 --> 05:27.192
A "FIREMAN"?

05:27.194 --> 05:28.493
THAT'S THE PROPER
WAY TO SAY IT,

05:28.495 --> 05:29.695
OR ELSE
YOU GET A SPANKING.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.562
DAMNIT, CHILDREN.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.897
WHY DO I ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE THE ONE

05:31.899 --> 05:33.498
TO EXPLAIN ALL THIS
STUFF TO YOU?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.133
ASK YOUR PARENTS
FOR ONCE.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.268
HEY, WAIT!

05:36.270 --> 05:39.171
DUDE, SOMETHING TELLS ME
THIS BRIS THING ISN'T GOOD.

05:39.173 --> 05:42.507
HEY, MACKY,
YOU GOT ANYMORE POT?

05:42.509 --> 05:44.910
MY FOUR-YEAR-OLD
NEEDS A FIX.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.245
HEY, MACKY!

05:46.247 --> 05:49.615
NOW I SEE WHAT YOU AND
HOMER SIMPSON HAVE IN COMMON,

05:49.617 --> 05:50.515
"DOPE"!

05:50.517 --> 05:51.883
HEY, MACKY!

05:51.885 --> 05:54.686
WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE?!

05:54.688 --> 05:56.054
( yelling )

05:56.056 --> 05:59.458
( male )
HEY, HIPPIE,
YOU GONNA DO SOME DRUGS?

06:00.728 --> 06:04.229
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN YOU
AROUND HERE BEFORE.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.865
NO, I JUST--
I HAD TO GET AWAY.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.134
I JUST
LOST MY JOB.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.502
OH, THAT'S WEAK, MAN.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.670
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED?

06:11.672 --> 06:13.305
YOU NEED A GOOD
STIFF DRINK.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.240
OH, I DON'T
DRINK, OKAY?

06:15.242 --> 06:18.076
TRUST ME, MAN,
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.178
DRINKING'S BAD.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.148
GO AHEAD,
DRINK THE BEER.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.916
IT'LL CALM
YOU DOWN.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.452
YEAH, WHY
THE HELL NOT?

06:27.454 --> 06:28.654
IT'S JUST A BEER.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.356
DON'T BE SUCH
A PUSSY, OKAY?

06:33.027 --> 06:35.427
SO HOW
DO YOU FEEL?

06:35.429 --> 06:36.194
( burping )

06:36.196 --> 06:37.129
OH, ABOUT
THE SAME.

06:37.131 --> 06:40.098
YOU JUST NEED SOMETHING
A LITTLE STRONGER.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.200
KYLE, YOU HAVE
TO STOP THEM.

06:42.202 --> 06:42.934
STOP WHO?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.136
I FOUND OUT
WHAT A BRIS IS.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.004
I FOUND OUT WHAT THEY'RE
GONNA DO TO IKE.

06:46.006 --> 06:46.672
WHAT?

06:46.674 --> 06:49.341
THEY'RE GONNA CHOP OFF
HIS WEE-WEE.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.444
CHOP OF HIS WEE-WEE,
ARE YOU SURE?

06:52.446 --> 06:54.279
YEAH, DUDE,
IT'S A JEWISH TRADITION.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.014
IT'S CALLED
A<i> CIRCUMSTISION.</i>

06:56.016 --> 06:57.683
DUDE,
THAT IS NOT COOL!

06:57.685 --> 06:59.951
CHOPPING OFF WEE-WEEs
IS NOT COOL!

06:59.953 --> 07:00.886
THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

07:00.888 --> 07:01.853
MY PARENTS
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.055
DUDE, I ASKED
FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

07:03.057 --> 07:04.856
THEY SAID ALL JEWISH BOYS
HAVE<i> CIRCUMSTISIONS</i>

07:04.858 --> 07:06.792
AND THEY MAKE IT INTO A PARTY
CALLED A "BRIS".

07:06.794 --> 07:09.961
DUDE, YOU DON'T JUST CHOP
OFF SOMEBODY'S FIREMAN.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.630
I WON'T BELIEVE IT,
I WON'T!

07:11.632 --> 07:14.099
I HAVE TO ASK
MY MOM AND DAD!

07:14.301 --> 07:16.835
♪ WE ARE YOUNG,
OKAY? ♪

07:16.837 --> 07:19.137
♪ HEARTACHE
TO HEARTACHE ♪

07:19.139 --> 07:21.039
♪ WE STAND, OKAY? ♪

07:21.041 --> 07:25.310

07:26.080 --> 07:27.846
IS THIS MY HOUSE?

07:27.848 --> 07:30.048
YOUR KEY AIN'T
GONNA WORK, MACKY.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.483
I CHANGED THE LOCKS!

07:31.485 --> 07:32.651
WHY,
MR. FREELY?

07:32.653 --> 07:34.286
I'M NOT RENTING
TO YOU ANYMORE!

07:34.288 --> 07:36.254
I HEARD THAT YOU GOT FIRED
FROM YOUR JOB

07:36.256 --> 07:37.489
FOR SELLING DRUGS
TO CHILDREN.

07:37.491 --> 07:41.093
NO, NO, NO, OKAY?
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

07:41.095 --> 07:43.328
DRUGS ARE AN
ILLEGAL NARCOTIC,

07:43.330 --> 07:45.197
AND HAVING
NEVER TAKEN DRUGS,

07:45.199 --> 07:47.232
I CAN SAY THAT
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.334
BUT I'VE NEVER
TAKEN DRUGS EITHER.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.737
I'VE NEVER TAKEN DRUGS,
AND LOOK AT ME,

07:51.739 --> 07:53.071
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.139
NOW GET OFF MY PROPERTY

07:54.141 --> 07:57.209
BEFORE I LOSE CONTROL
AND KILL YOU!

07:58.011 --> 07:59.678
OH!
OKAY?

07:59.680 --> 08:00.912
DRUG USER!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.180
DRUG USER!

08:02.182 --> 08:05.584
COME BACK HERE!

08:05.586 --> 08:07.185
JUST
A LITTLE HIGHER.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.086
MOM, DAD!

08:08.088 --> 08:09.087
OH, HI,
BOOBALA.

08:09.089 --> 08:09.988
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.890
YOU CAN HELP US
DECORATE FOR THE PARTY.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.625
YOUR MOTHER'S
MADE<i> GAHABAKHABA.</i>

08:13.627 --> 08:15.560
WHAT THE HELL IS
<i>GAHABAKHABA</i>?

08:15.562 --> 08:17.863
MOM, DAD, WHAT EXACTLY
IS THIS PARTY FOR?

08:17.865 --> 08:22.768
TO CELEBRATE YOUR LITTLE
BROTHER'S PASSAGE INTO LIFE.

08:22.770 --> 08:23.602
MEANING WHAT?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.303
MEANING WE'RE GOING
TO CIRCUMCISE HIM.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.572
THEY<i> ARE</i> GONNA
CUT OFF HIS FIREMAN.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.341
IT'S JEWISH
TRADITION, BOOBY.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.209
NORMALLY WE DO IT
RIGHT AFTER THE BABY IS BORN,

08:31.211 --> 08:34.045
BUT WE HAD TO DO IT LATER
FOR IKE BECAUSE HE'S A--

08:34.047 --> 08:35.180
AAHH...!!

08:37.684 --> 08:40.085
OH, NOW WHAT'S
GOTTEN INTO HIM?

08:40.087 --> 08:43.054
STAN, WILL YOU GO
TALK TO HIM?

08:43.223 --> 08:46.892
LET US CUT OFF
YOUR PEE-PEE, STAN.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.493
AAHH...!

08:48.762 --> 08:51.263
OY, WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH THEM?

08:51.265 --> 08:53.331
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY PARENTS
ARE CANNIBALS.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.433
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, DUDE?

08:54.435 --> 08:55.500
I HAVE TO SAVE
MY LITTLE BROTHER.

08:55.502 --> 08:59.070
I HAVE TO SEND HIM AWAY UNTIL
MY PARENTS COME TO THEIR SENSES.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.038
COME ON, IKE.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.173
COVER ME
FOR A WHILE.

09:01.175 --> 09:03.408
I'LL FIND A PLACE
TO HIDE HIM AND COME BACK.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.109
NO WAY, DUDE,

09:04.111 --> 09:05.444
WE'RE NOT STAYING ALONE
IN YOUR HOUSE

09:05.446 --> 09:06.745
WITH YOUR WEE-WEE
CHOPPING PARENTS.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.281
JUST GIVE ME
30 MINUTES.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.385
I CAN'T SLEEP,
IT'S TOO COLD, OKAY?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.754
HEY, YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO WARM YOU UP?

09:15.756 --> 09:18.356
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS
DARK ALLEY WAS TAKEN.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.992
HERE, TRY THIS,
IT'LL WARM YOU UP.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.228
MARIJUANA'S BAD.

09:23.230 --> 09:23.862
WHAT?

09:23.864 --> 09:26.932
MARIJUANA MAKES YOU FEEL
DEPRESSED AND LOW.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.267
AND YOU DON'T FEEL
THAT WAY NOW?

09:29.269 --> 09:30.969
GOOD POINT.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.442
I DON'T
FEEL ANY DIFF--

09:37.444 --> 09:40.946
OOH BABY,
GET DOWN, OKAY?

09:40.948 --> 09:43.949
MAN, THIS ALLEY
IS COOL.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.284
IT'S SO ALIVE
AND BEAUTIFUL.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.953
OH, BOY.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.455
COME ON, IKE,
HURRY UP.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.523
( baby talk )

09:51.525 --> 09:52.657
WHERE'S THE NEXT
TRAIN GOING?

09:52.659 --> 09:55.193
LINCOLN, NEBRASKA,
TRAIN LEAVES IN FIVE MINUTES.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.962
YOU WANT TO GO
TO NEBRASKA, IKE?

09:56.964 --> 09:57.629
NO.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.197
I NEED ONE TICKET
FOR MY LITTLE BROTHER.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.265
THAT'S A
LITTLE BROTHER?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.500
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A TRASH CAN.

10:01.502 --> 10:03.101
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HIS HEAD?

10:03.103 --> 10:03.835
HUH?

10:03.837 --> 10:06.004
WE CAN'T THROW
CAUCASIAN BABIES

10:06.006 --> 10:07.072
ON AN
OUTBOUND TRAIN.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.874
BUT MY PARENTS ARE GONNA
CUT OFF HIS DING-DONG.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.742
WHY WOULD
THEY DO THAT?

10:10.744 --> 10:11.877
THEY'VE GONE CRAZY
FOR A WHILE.

10:11.879 --> 10:14.679
I HAVE TO HIDE MY BROTHER
UNTIL THEY COME TO THEIR SENSES.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.014
NO CAN DO, SONNY.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.148
DAMNIT!

10:20.153 --> 10:22.153
IKE, IF YOU WANT
TO KEEP YOUR PENIS,

10:22.155 --> 10:25.323
YOU HAVE TO
GET ON THIS TRAIN.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.424
READY, IKE?

10:26.426 --> 10:27.225
KICK THE BABY!

10:27.227 --> 10:29.160
DON'T KICK THE--

10:29.329 --> 10:30.562
GOODBYE, IKE,
BE SAFE!

10:30.564 --> 10:31.763
I'LL COME FIND YOU
IN NEBRASKA

10:31.765 --> 10:33.431
WHEN MOM AND DAD
ARE BACK TO NORMAL.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.000
( Ike )
BYE, BYE.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.104
OH, MAN,
WHERE AM I?

10:39.106 --> 10:39.838
HEY, WOW.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.141
IT'S THAT COUNSELOR
FROM THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
MR. MACKY.

10:43.143 --> 10:43.808
WOW, DUDE.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.577
HI, BOYS,
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

10:45.579 --> 10:47.479
PRETTY GOOD, MAN,
HOW ARE YOU?

10:47.481 --> 10:48.413
OH, I'VE
BEEN BETTER.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.082
I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF TOWN
FOR DOING DRUGS.

10:51.084 --> 10:51.816
HEY, US TOO.

10:51.818 --> 10:52.651
YEAH, REMEMBER?

10:52.653 --> 10:54.319
YOU CAUGHT US SMOKING WEED
IN THE BATHROOM

10:54.321 --> 10:55.387
AND GOT US
SUSPENDED.

10:55.389 --> 10:58.423
OH, FORTUNE,
HOW YOU MOCK ME.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.692
CHEER UP, BRO, ALL YOU NEED
IS SOME CLEAR LIQUID

11:00.694 --> 11:02.327
TO GET
YOUR HEAD STRAIGHT.

11:02.329 --> 11:06.431
UH, BOYS,
LSD IS BAD.

11:08.468 --> 11:12.270
WHO PUT ALL THIS
COTTON IN MY MOUTH?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.739
YEAH, BABY.

11:14.741 --> 11:18.043
THE WORLD
IS SO SMALL.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.579
I'M FREE.

11:20.581 --> 11:22.714
I'M FREE.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.382
SWEET, DUDE,
TOTALLY KILLER.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.985
THAT GUY'S
TOTALLY TRIPPING.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.621
THERE,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:29.623 --> 11:31.356
WHAT THE HELL'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.524
I'M MAKING
A DUMMY IKE DOLL.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.959
MY PARENTS THINK HE'S OUT
WITH ME RIGHT NOW

11:33.961 --> 11:35.293
AND I HAVE TO
BRING HIM BACK FOR DINNER.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.895
I THINK YOU MOM'S GONNA
NOTICE THAT ISN'T IKE.

11:36.897 --> 11:40.231
NOT IF I SAY HE'S SICK
AND PUT HIM TO BED RIGHT AWAY.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.233
NO, GO AWAY,
BAD BOG.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.568
WHAT DID YOU MAKE
THAT DOLL OUT OF?

11:43.570 --> 11:45.370
I USED A BUNCH OF BONES
FROM THE BUTCHER SHOP.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.340
IS THAT WHY IT
STINKS SO BAD?

11:48.742 --> 11:49.674
HI, BOYS.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.242
( all together )
HI, MR. MACKY.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.812
ARE YOU BOYS
STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE?

11:53.814 --> 11:54.779
( together )
YES!

11:54.781 --> 11:58.049
I'M JUST GONNA GO
OVER HERE FOR A WHILE.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.151
ANYWAYS, I NEED
YOU GUYS TO HELP ME

12:00.153 --> 12:02.220
SO THAT MY PARENTS
DON'T REALIZE IKE IS GONE.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.488
KNOCK IT OFF,
ASSHOLE!

12:03.490 --> 12:06.124
I'M NEVER GOING BACK
TO YOUR PARENT'S HOUSE.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.060
IF IT WERE YOUR LITTLE BROTHER,
WE'D HELP YOU.

12:09.062 --> 12:13.164
WAIT A MINUTE,
NO, YOU WOULDN'T!

12:18.438 --> 12:19.838
WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THAT, HONEY?

12:19.840 --> 12:24.009
SOMEBODY DROPPED OFF
A PERFECTLY GOOD TRASH CAN.

12:24.645 --> 12:25.477
YEAH.

12:25.479 --> 12:27.145
( baby talk )

12:27.280 --> 12:29.214
BOOBY, WHERE HAVE

12:29.216 --> 12:30.815
DINNER'S BEEN READY
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.751
SORRY, MOM, I JUST
HAD TO DEAL WITH IKE.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.618
HE'S BEEN
CRANKY.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.321
HOW IS MY
LITTLE JELLY BEAN?

12:36.323 --> 12:37.155
( baby talk )

12:37.157 --> 12:39.057
I'M GONNA TAKE HIM UP TO
THE BATHROOM TO GET WASHED UP.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.260
OKAY, BUT FIRST LET MOMMY
GIVE YOU A KISS.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.330
NO, MOM, HE DOESN'T
WANT YOU KISSING HIM.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.532
OH, MY GOD,
MAKE HIM STOP!

12:47.534 --> 12:49.300
PUT HIM DOWN,
YOU STUPID DOG!

12:49.302 --> 12:51.369
MY BABY,

13:03.550 --> 13:06.651
OH, HE'S DEAD,

13:06.653 --> 13:08.787
MY LITTLE
BOOBALA'S DEAD.

13:08.789 --> 13:13.191
THERE, THERE, SHEILA,
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.297
"YAY, USHER US

13:19.299 --> 13:20.699
SAYETH SOME
JEWISH GUY ONCE,

13:20.701 --> 13:24.569

13:28.775 --> 13:30.375
HEY,

13:30.377 --> 13:32.677
HOW COME IKE'S TOMBSTONE
HAS A CANADIAN FLAG ON IT?

13:32.679 --> 13:35.013
WELL, BOOBY, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU HAVE TO KNOW.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.383
IKE WASN'T REALLY YOUR BROTHER,
HE WAS ADOPTED.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.017
WHAT?!

13:39.019 --> 13:41.019
HE WAS NOT REALLY
A BROSLOFSKI.

13:41.021 --> 13:41.986
HE WAS CANADIAN.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.321
BUT WE LOVED HIM
ALL THE SAME.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.889
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THAT ALL THIS TIME

13:44.891 --> 13:47.792
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
PROTECT IKE FROM HAVING
HIS FIREMAN CUT OFF,

13:47.794 --> 13:49.327
AND HE'S NOT EVEN
MY REAL BROTHER?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.762
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:50.764 --> 13:53.631
DUDE, IKE ISN'T DEAD,

13:53.633 --> 13:55.467
WHAT, WHAT,

13:55.469 --> 13:56.901
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD THEM THAT.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.037
NOW THEY'RE GONNA FIND HIM
AND CUT OFF HIS PENIS.

13:59.039 --> 13:59.738
"FIREMAN".

13:59.740 --> 14:03.341
HE'S NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

14:04.745 --> 14:07.145
OH, MY GOD,
THEY'VE KILLED KENNY!

14:07.147 --> 14:08.680
YOU BASTARDS.

YAY, LET US PONDER
THE LORD'S MERCIES.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.786

14:33.607 --> 14:36.808

15:14.815 --> 15:16.147
"TAKE CARE OF YOUR
LITTLE BROTHER, KYLE",

15:16.149 --> 15:17.849
AND HE WASN'T EVEN
REALLY MY LITTLE BROTHER!

15:17.851 --> 15:19.317
KYLE, JUST BECAUSE
IKE IS ADOPTED

15:19.319 --> 15:21.553
DOESN'T MAKE HIM

15:21.555 --> 15:22.453
YEAH, RIGHT.

YOU GO THROUGH LIFE THINKING
YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL, OKAY?

15:54.888 --> 15:58.223
THEN YOU REALIZE THAT
YOU'RE MORE THAN THAT, OKAY?

16:53.980 --> 16:55.313
TOUGH LOVE,
MR. MACKY.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.848
WE'RE TAKING YOU
TO REHAB.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.283
I DON'T WANT TO
GO TO REHAB.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.151
I HAVEN'T EVEN
DONE DRUGS IN WEEKS.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.053
WE WERE WRONG FOR
SHUNNING YOU, MR. MACKY,

17:02.055 --> 17:02.987
AND WE APOLOGIZE.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.722

YOU NEEDED HELP.

THANKS FOR COMING
TO IKE'S BRIS.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.803
LOOK, IKE,
IT'S YOUR UNCLE MURRAY.

17:18.805 --> 17:19.904
HELLO, IKE.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.139
SAY, WHERE'S KYLE?

17:21.141 --> 17:22.941
HE'S BEEN SENT TO HIS ROOM
FOR BEING A BASTARD.

17:22.943 --> 17:26.744
HE'S DECIDED THAT IKE ISN'T
HIS BROTHER SINCE HE'S ADOPTED.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.445
HI, THERE.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.680
HELLO, DO I
KNOW YOU?

17:28.682 --> 17:30.548
OH, NO,
BUT I NEVER MISS A BRIS.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.916
HERE, I BROUGHT
SOME DIP.

17:31.918 --> 17:32.650
OH, THANKS.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.987
I GUESS THE CHOPPING
IS ABOUT TO COMMENCE.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.088
( baby talk )

17:37.090 --> 17:39.090
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.693
( baby talk )

17:42.629 --> 17:44.662
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.397
THAT ISN'T GONNA
WORK ON ME,<i> CANADIAN.</i>

17:46.399 --> 17:47.799
MAYBE YOU'RE BEING
TOO HARD ON HIM, DUDE.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.901
NO WAY, THERE'S NO
REAL CONNECTION BETWEEN US.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.704
IT WAS ALL
A BIG LIE.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.973
TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE...

17:54.975 --> 17:56.307
GO ON, CANADIAN,
BEAT IT!

17:56.309 --> 17:59.010
I'M THROUGH GETTING
IN TROUBLE FOR YOU!

17:59.012 --> 18:00.712
( baby talk )

18:00.714 --> 18:02.847
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

18:02.849 --> 18:04.382
BEFORE ANYBODY
CAN HELP YOU.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.051
BUT I DON'T THINK
I REALLY<i> HAVE</i> A PROBLEM.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.152
NONSENSE,
YOU DID DRUGS.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.288
I SUPPOSE YOU FORGOT
ALL ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.190
I DON'T REALLY
HAVE A FAMILY.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.224
AND YOU
LOST YOUR JOB.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.826
NO, I LOST MY JOB
BEFORE THAT.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.094
MR. MACKY, YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADULT.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.030
THE PROBLEM WITH DRUGS
IS THAT PEOPLE FORGET
TO STOP DOING THEM.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.866
THERE'S A TIME AND A PLACE
FOR EVERYTHING, MR. MACKY,

18:21.868 --> 18:23.101
AND IT'S CALLED
"COLLEGE".

18:23.103 --> 18:25.837
NOW I WANT YOU
TO REPEAT AFTER ME,

18:25.839 --> 18:28.072
DRUGS ARE BAD.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.074
"DRUGS ARE BAD."

18:30.076 --> 18:32.176
DRUGS ARE BAD.

18:32.178 --> 18:35.079
"DRUGS ARE BAD."

18:35.081 --> 18:37.081
HELLO,
DR. SCHWARTZ.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.350
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ALL THIS WAY

18:39.352 --> 18:41.019
TO PERFORM IKE'S BRIS.

18:41.021 --> 18:42.487
OH, MY PLEASURE,
SHEILA.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.222
I BROUGHT THE NORMAL
CUTTING DEVICE,

18:44.224 --> 18:46.724
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
THAT IKE WAS CANADIAN,

18:46.726 --> 18:48.326
SO I BROUGHT
THE RIGHT ONE.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.028
WHERE IS THE
LITTLE RUG-RAT?

18:50.030 --> 18:51.662
RIGHT OVER HERE.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.065
COME HERE, YOU.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.233
OW!

18:55.368 --> 18:57.201
( baby talk )

19:00.273 --> 19:01.906
IKE!

19:01.908 --> 19:03.241
IKE!

19:03.243 --> 19:05.343
( baby talk )

19:07.881 --> 19:12.650
THERE YOU ARE,
COME ON, IKE, IT'S TIME.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.553
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MY LITTLE BROTHER!

19:15.555 --> 19:17.088
BUT SON,
I JUST--

19:17.090 --> 19:18.623
YOU AREN'T GONNA
CUT OFF HIS WEE-WEE!

19:18.625 --> 19:20.124
NOT TODAY,
YOU SICK-ASS WEIRDO!

19:20.126 --> 19:21.759
KYLE, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:21.761 --> 19:24.095
AND YOU, YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

19:24.097 --> 19:25.830
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT US MALES

19:25.832 --> 19:27.432
ARE DEFINED
BY OUR FIREMEN?

19:27.434 --> 19:29.467
YES, THE FIREMAN
IS VERY MAGICAL.

19:29.469 --> 19:33.171
IF YOU RUB HIS HELMET,
HE SPITS IN YOUR EYE.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.073
KYLE, A CIRCUMCISION

19:35.075 --> 19:37.508
IS A VERY COMMON THING
FOR IKE TO HAVE.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.211
HIS FATHER HAD IT,
HIS GRANDFATHER HAD IT,

19:40.213 --> 19:43.314
AND HIS BROTHER
HAD IT.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.282
NO!

19:44.284 --> 19:45.516
NO, IT ISN'T TRUE!

19:45.518 --> 19:46.684
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
CUT IT OFF.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.221
WE'RE JUST GONNA SNIP IT
SO THAT IT LOOKS BIGGER.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.790
OH, HEY, THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE A BAD IDEA.

19:52.792 --> 19:56.394
YEAH, I WANT TO GET
A<i> CIRCUMSTISION</i> TOO.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.963
CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. MACKY.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.198
YOU ARE
FULLY RECOVERED.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.000
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR EVERYTHING, OKAY?

20:03.002 --> 20:05.069
I FEEL LIKE
MY OLD SELF AGAIN.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.472
JUST ONE
MORE THING...

20:07.574 --> 20:10.741
REMEMBER THAT
YOU<i> CAN</i> STAY SOBER.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.977
I WILL,
MISS SOCIAL WORKER.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.546
I WILL, OKAY?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.482
IT'S OKAY, IKE,
I'M HERE.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.051
AND A ONE AND A TWO
AND A...

20:20.053 --> 20:21.052
BRIS!

20:21.054 --> 20:22.353
OUCH.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.089
COOKIE MONSTER.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.090
IKE,
YOU'RE OKAY.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.926
WELL, DUDE, I GUESS HAVING
A BRIS ISN'T ALL THAT BAD.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.595
YEAH, I'VE LEARNED
SOMETHING TODAY.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.230
FAMILY ISN'T ABOUT
WHOSE BLOOD YOU HAVE,

20:32.232 --> 20:33.831
IT'S ABOUT
WHO YOU CARE ABOUT.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.067
THAT'S WHY I FEEL YOU GUYS
ARE MORE THAN JUST FRIENDS,

20:36.069 --> 20:37.068
YOU'RE
MY FAMILY.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.536
EXCEPT FOR CARTMAN.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.203
NATURALLY.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.104
SCREW YOU, GUYS!

20:40.106 --> 20:43.941
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN YOUR
PENIS CHOPPING FAMILY!

20:43.943 --> 20:45.710
AND SO NOW,
CHILDREN,

20:45.712 --> 20:47.211
YOUR SCHOOL COUNSELOR
IS BACK

20:47.213 --> 20:51.015
TO TELL YOU FIRSTHAND
ABOUT HIS NASTY EXPERIENCE

20:51.017 --> 20:52.083
WITH DRUGS
AND ALCOHOL.

20:52.085 --> 20:56.554
OKAY, KIDS,
YOU SHOULDN'T DO DRUGS, OKAY?

20:56.556 --> 20:57.388
DRUGS ARE BAD.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.024
YOU SEE, I WAS AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.

21:00.026 --> 21:00.992
I WAS A WRECK.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.727
I DIDN'T EVEN
CARE ABOUT MONEY.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.762
I WAS WASTING
MY LIFE...

21:04.764 --> 21:06.831
YOU GUYS WANT TO COME
TO MY BRIS TOMORROW?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.399
YOU CAN'T HAVE
YOUR BRIS TOMORROW,

21:08.401 --> 21:09.500
THAT'S WHEN
I'M HAVING MINE.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.902
NO WAY, I SET UP
MINE FIRST, HIPPY!

21:10.904 --> 21:12.870
NOW, BOYS, YOU NEED
TO LISTEN UP, OKAY?

21:12.872 --> 21:17.008
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT MIGHT
SAVE YOUR LIFE SOMEDAY, OKAY?

21:17.010 --> 21:19.343
OKAY, MR. MACKY,
OKAY?

21:19.345 --> 21:20.077
OKAY.

21:20.079 --> 21:20.811
OKAY?

21:20.813 --> 21:21.546
OKAY.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.413
OKAY?

21:22.415 --> 21:23.314
OKAY.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.416
NOW AS I WAS SAYING,
DRUGS ARE BAD.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.151
YOU SHOULDN'T
DO DRUGS.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.587
IF YOU DO THEM,
YOU'RE BAD.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.822
BECAUSE DRUGS
ARE BAD, OKAY?

21:31.824 --> 21:33.424
IT'S A BAD THING
TO DO, DRUGS,

21:33.426 --> 21:36.928
SO DON'T BE BAD
BY DOING DRUGS, OKAY?

21:36.930 --> 21:38.095
THAT'D BE BAD.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.865
DRUGS ARE BAD,
OKAY?
