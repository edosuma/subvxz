00:01.869 --> 00:04.519
-[woman]<i> previously on</i>
all rise...
-I am going into holistic law.

00:04.538 --> 00:07.189
Ooh! I'm late for my first day
in the da's office.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.458
-Or you could just come back.
-I miss you, too.

00:09.493 --> 00:11.460
Maybe I should sue you
for a wedding date.

00:11.495 --> 00:13.545
Let me just get the firm
back on its feet.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.715
This election exposed
your vulnerabilities. I look
forward to illuminating them,

00:16.751 --> 00:19.418
-ms. Carmichael. [chuckles]
-judge carmichael.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.155
[upbeat music playing]

00:24.792 --> 00:27.092
[protestors shouting]

00:35.136 --> 00:37.269
[reporters clamoring]

00:39.240 --> 00:40.889
-I know this is upsetting.
-Hmm.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.741
You know what? [sighs]
maybe, um,

00:42.777 --> 00:44.893
-we should find
another entrance.
-No, that's okay.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.245
[cell phone beeps]

00:46.280 --> 00:49.731
<i> hi, my lovelies!</i>
<i> Do you see all those</i>
<i> little motherpuckers</i>

00:49.750 --> 00:51.233
in tyler pierce's fan club?

00:51.252 --> 00:54.086
<i> Well, they're hating on me</i>
<i> because I like my kink</i>
<i> and my sex rough.</i>

00:54.121 --> 00:56.922
-But, hey! To tell the truth--
-your post could come back
to bite you.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.924
No, that psycho went too far.
He put me in a hospital,
all right?

00:58.959 --> 01:01.293
I'm gonna sit in that
courtroom every day until
the world knows

01:01.345 --> 01:03.178
-I'll have the last laugh.
-Gigi, you are a witness.

01:03.214 --> 01:05.464
So you're only allowed
in the courtroom
when you testify.

01:05.516 --> 01:09.251
<i> My client looks forward</i>
<i> to refuting ms. Raymond's</i>
<i> outrageous claims.</i>

01:09.270 --> 01:11.937
<i> Which are a desperate</i>
<i> grab for publicity,</i>

01:11.972 --> 01:14.139
more social media followers

01:14.191 --> 01:16.942
<i> -and financial gain.</i>
-[gigi]<i> hey, hey.</i>
<i> Bring your crew over here.</i>

01:16.977 --> 01:19.194
-[reporter]<i> what is</i>
<i> your side of it?</i>
<i> -You want the truth?</i>

01:19.230 --> 01:21.864
I'll give you the truth.
He's a lying sack of sh--

01:21.899 --> 01:23.782
-gigi!
-[man] you're a liar!

01:23.818 --> 01:25.784
[crowd shouting]

01:31.325 --> 01:33.325
[indistinct shouting]

01:44.588 --> 01:48.841
you look suspiciously
well-rested

01:48.893 --> 01:50.458
with a tinge of melancholy.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.793
What am I, a bottle of wine?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.562
-[chuckles]
-how do you do that?

01:53.597 --> 01:55.964
You told me robin was taking
bailey to visit his parents
in detroit.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.133
Oh, it's our first time apart.

01:58.152 --> 02:01.636
When I was two, my mother
went to an ashram in india
for six weeks

02:01.655 --> 02:02.988
and I had no hang-ups.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.656
Hmm. Not a one.

02:05.609 --> 02:07.025
Ooh! I have something
to cheer you up.

02:07.077 --> 02:09.828
We have a new, outrageously
qualified stenographer...

02:09.864 --> 02:12.731
[whispers] ...Who can't hum
a tune. I checked.

02:12.766 --> 02:16.418
These came to my chambers.
No card, but I figured

02:16.453 --> 02:18.804
more election victory flowers
for lola.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.822
[lola] they do keep coming.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.040
I'll start a "thank you" card.

02:22.076 --> 02:24.676
There's a card right here.
[chuckles]

02:25.796 --> 02:27.012
they're for me.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.264
I guess we can't always assume
they're for "her honor."

02:29.300 --> 02:31.550
-flip, flip.
-Oh, ho, ho!

02:31.602 --> 02:33.852
I'm off to another
"smash 'n grab" hearing.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.004
-Mmm.
-So...

02:36.023 --> 02:38.340
-Give it up.
-If you must know,

02:38.359 --> 02:40.425
I did some volunteer work
for a voter education group.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.595
It is a lot of posies
for volunteering.

02:43.631 --> 02:44.863
I proved useful.

02:44.899 --> 02:47.682
-Hmm.
-First up, we have
a trail readiness hearing for

02:47.701 --> 02:50.569
-a hockey player, tyler--
-tyler pierce.
Who could forget?

02:50.621 --> 02:53.372
I hate celebrity cases.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.024
You're either accused
of favoritism or of punishing
them for their fame.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.309
-You can't win.
-Hmm.

03:02.299 --> 03:05.801
I've got a almond milk,
half-caf macchiato for
kiki rice.

03:05.836 --> 03:07.719
-Hardly. Look alive!
-Ho!

03:08.973 --> 03:11.089
You got skills for somebody
who just started.

03:11.141 --> 03:13.141
-Trying.
-You want some pointers?

03:13.177 --> 03:15.043
I would love some.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.212
-Lebron makes it look so easy.
-That's true.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.897
So...

03:18.933 --> 03:21.016
-What'd you want to
talk to me about? Hey!
-Well,

03:22.069 --> 03:23.602
I'm representing this, uh...

03:24.572 --> 03:26.738
This hairdresser

03:26.774 --> 03:28.607
-who's got this thing--
-okay.

03:28.659 --> 03:31.276
You are so not here to talk
about some hairdresser case.

03:31.328 --> 03:33.579
You know you wanna talk about
you leaving the other night

03:33.614 --> 03:35.914
-with the bailiff. Delilah.
-Ooh.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.000
-"delia." wait,
are you jealous?
-Oh, delia.

03:38.035 --> 03:39.751
-Come on.
-I think you might be
a little jealous.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.838
You know what?
Whatever you got going on
with the hot bailiff,

03:42.873 --> 03:44.089
that's none of my business.

03:45.876 --> 03:49.244
Well, I worried that
it bothered you.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.295
Seriously, we're just friends.

03:53.884 --> 03:55.684
-Start with your free throw.
-Actually...

03:57.021 --> 03:58.971
Just with us two...

03:59.023 --> 04:02.107
For now, just friends.
Okay? 'cause...

04:03.227 --> 04:04.192
Okay.

04:05.062 --> 04:06.528
Okay.

04:06.563 --> 04:08.530
-Okay, baller.
-[laughs]

04:08.565 --> 04:10.949
so how's it going with
the whole holistic
lollapalooza, huh?

04:10.985 --> 04:12.651
Uh, I scored a meeting
today with

04:12.703 --> 04:16.655
the edith vasquez who put
holistic law on the map.

04:16.707 --> 04:19.041
And I'm gonna ask her
how to start my own practice.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.960
Up top!

04:21.996 --> 04:25.631
Hey, listen. If there's anyone
who can get clients through
the system in one piece,

04:25.666 --> 04:28.250
-it is emily lopez.
-Huh.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.336
Hey, I should, uh...

04:31.388 --> 04:33.472
-I should go, or I'll be late.
-Okay.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.057
Thanks for the macchiato.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.175
Hmm.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.646
-Bye.
-Bye.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.987
[crowd shouting]

04:49.023 --> 04:52.140
yo, callan.
It is a zoo out there.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.859
And you are looking
at the zookeeper.

04:53.911 --> 04:56.495
-You're handling
the tyler pierce case?
-This one hurts, man.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.031
I mean, amy might be my fiance
but hockey, hockey is--

04:59.083 --> 05:00.198
no, it's your first love.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.367
Since I was ten years old.
Now look at me.

05:02.419 --> 05:05.653
Going after the guy who
single-handedly put the blades
in the play-offs.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.989
On top of that, amy,
she's so wrapped up
in the case,

05:08.008 --> 05:10.842
she literally falls asleep
cuddling a legal file.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.928
Man, tyler pierce
of all people.

05:12.963 --> 05:14.429
Too bad I'm not with
the da anymore.

05:14.465 --> 05:16.181
-We make a killer team.
-Mmm. Hmm.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.832
-You pick a new head
deputy yet?
-[elevator dings]

05:17.851 --> 05:20.602
it's not that easy, man.
And on top of all that,

05:20.637 --> 05:23.605
bravo's sending me some
new guy I'm supposed
to break in.

05:27.644 --> 05:28.777
Must be the new guy.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.281
All right, we gotta move.
Give you the rundown.

05:33.317 --> 05:36.068
Defendant traded text
with the victim prior to
a one-night stand

05:36.120 --> 05:38.186
-that turned violent.
-Okay. I was just heading--

05:38.205 --> 05:40.572
the defendant has
no criminal record,
no violent history,

05:40.624 --> 05:42.690
aside from, you know,
playing hockey.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.077
Defense wants to plead this
down to a slap on the wrist.

05:45.129 --> 05:46.578
You know,
misdemeanor, trespass.

05:46.630 --> 05:49.531
-Wait, are we--
-what I'm talking about is
that if I were in charge,

05:49.550 --> 05:51.249
I'd go after felony
domestic violence with

05:51.301 --> 05:52.801
a great bodily
injury enhancement.

05:52.836 --> 05:54.052
[cell phone ringing]

05:54.088 --> 05:55.170
huh. Speak of the devil.

05:55.806 --> 05:57.205
Yeah. Callan.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.057
[indistinct conversation
on phone]

05:59.093 --> 06:00.475
are you sure you wanna
do this?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.094
Yeah, all right.

06:02.146 --> 06:03.645
Wait. Amy.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.930
Hi.

06:04.982 --> 06:07.566
Da's willing to strike
the gbi and offer a plea
to the felony.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.151
Time served,
plus three years' probation.

06:09.186 --> 06:11.269
Just tell me, would I have to
sit out the season?

06:11.321 --> 06:13.739
Tyler, wait for me outside
the courtroom. Okay?

06:17.111 --> 06:18.944
Misdemeanor, simple battery.

06:18.996 --> 06:20.695
No, no. Felony.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.167
Sir, there's no way
I can agree to--

06:25.202 --> 06:27.119
[indistinct chatter on phone]

06:27.171 --> 06:30.789
yeah, well, looks like
you got yourself a deal.

06:30.841 --> 06:34.259
Well, just go in without me,
I'll be right in. Just gonna
hammer out some details.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.511
Mark. I'm not
your second chair.

06:36.547 --> 06:39.014
I've been trying to tell you
I was just saying hi.

06:39.850 --> 06:41.133
Then who's bravo's new guy?

06:41.552 --> 06:43.101
I am.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.269
What, are you an intern?

06:44.304 --> 06:46.304
I get that all the time.
Don't worry, I'm up to speed.

06:46.356 --> 06:48.273
I've been following
right behind you
the whole time.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.975
The young have
excellent hearing.

06:50.027 --> 06:51.476
Hey, bravo,
you messing with me?

06:51.528 --> 06:54.146
Yeah, I just met
doogie howser, j.D.
Oh, he's a prodigy?

06:54.198 --> 06:56.281
-Uh-huh.
-I can't believe I'll be
working with mark callan.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.484
I've followed your career,
convicted a deputy in
<i> people v wane mccarthy,</i>

06:59.536 --> 07:02.154
outfoxed the famous actress
into confessing to murder?

07:02.206 --> 07:03.655
-Speaking of show business...
-I wasn't.

07:03.707 --> 07:06.324
...I've got the only indian
parents who wanted their kid
to do standup.

07:06.376 --> 07:09.711
I chose the law. My talent
for getting an audience
in the palm of my hand--

07:09.746 --> 07:11.112
you know what? I forgot.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.215
Sir, how much breaking in of
this kid do you want me to do?

07:13.250 --> 07:15.133
We've got a trial readiness
hearing and it's about
to start.

07:15.169 --> 07:17.285
-Oh, uh, right. I'll go on in
to the courtroom now.
-Yeah.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.970
Go in, I need to
finish up with bravo.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.455
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.475
-Oh, one more thing.
-He's, no, he's pulled out
a phone. I don't know...

07:23.510 --> 07:24.509
[camera shutter clicks]

07:27.397 --> 07:30.065
can you please explain to me
what is happening?

07:31.735 --> 07:32.851
[indistinct chatter]

07:39.660 --> 07:42.160
is mr. Callan stuck
in an elevator, mr...

07:42.196 --> 07:45.914
-I don't know you.
-Uh, deputy district attorney
tajdar biswas.

07:45.949 --> 07:48.166
Though, I go by teddy
at starbucks, your honor.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.984
Okay, then, mr. Biswas.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.672
Ms. Quinn. While we wait
for mr. Callan to grace us
with his presence--

07:53.707 --> 07:54.589
excuse me.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.375
Is biswas spelled
the french way?

07:57.427 --> 07:58.426
O-I-s?

07:58.929 --> 08:00.545
Or with a w?

08:00.597 --> 08:02.597
As in the "world?"

08:03.300 --> 08:06.718
uh, it's b-I-s-w-a-s.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.520
That is quite the delivery.

08:09.106 --> 08:10.272
What delivery?

08:11.141 --> 08:12.674
Hmm.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.060
Where were we? Are both sides
ready for trial?

08:15.112 --> 08:16.695
Actually, your honor.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.898
Both parties have agreed to
plea of misdemeanor,
simple battery.

08:19.950 --> 08:23.685
From the preliminary hearing
transcript, the charge sounds
quite low.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.186
-What's the people's
reasoning?
-Um...

08:25.205 --> 08:27.622
I think we should wait
for mr. Callan to clarify.

08:27.658 --> 08:29.958
[chuckles] I really hope
the lenience of the offer

08:29.993 --> 08:31.693
is not the result
of special treatment.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.045
Everyone in my courtroom
is treated the same.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.747
Rich, poor or otherwise.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.301
I mean, mr. Callan will
enumerate the reasons for
reducing the charge.

08:39.336 --> 08:42.921
But from what I can tell,
the people would have
no problem

08:42.973 --> 08:44.256
-securing a conviction.
-What?

08:44.641 --> 08:45.873
No, uh...

08:45.893 --> 08:48.093
-Mr. Callan and I--
-are there any problems
with proof?

08:48.145 --> 08:50.228
Uh, not that I can see.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.980
I mean, the victim
is co-operative

08:52.015 --> 08:54.232
and the hospital photos speak
for themselves, your honor.

08:54.268 --> 08:57.819
As mr. Biswas pointed out,
these injuries do appear
quite traumatic.

08:57.854 --> 09:00.322
And if it's a crime here,
it's much more serious
than the offer.

09:00.357 --> 09:01.990
I'm not inclined
to accept the plea.

09:02.025 --> 09:03.391
We're going to trial.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.826
I didn't do anything wrong.

09:04.861 --> 09:06.578
No, no, no. The people
and I made a deal.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.497
And then that little--
mr. Biswas, blew it up.

09:09.533 --> 09:11.566
I assume driver took
the u-turn, we're going
to trial.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.568
-Not that I'm complaining.
-But I'm complaining.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.421
[lola] attorneys,
in my chambers now.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.456
[crowd clamoring]

09:23.847 --> 09:26.214
[in sing-song voice]
someone's gonna lose a tooth.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.754
Gigi raymond is a self-serving
scammer who engaged in
consensual sex play.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.405
A felony charge is outrageous.

09:34.424 --> 09:38.293
The defendant is using a few
dirty texts as a cover for
strangling a woman

09:38.345 --> 09:40.745
-to unconsciousness.
-And a domestic abuse charge

09:40.764 --> 09:42.964
requires some semblance
of a relationship.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.966
The texts spanned
several days, your honor.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.418
Oh, if that's a relationship,
then stop griping
I'm uncommunicative.

09:47.437 --> 09:49.420
You've been stonewalling me
for weeks about
the wedding date, amy.

09:49.439 --> 09:52.941
-Counsel, we are not in your
romantic comedy.
-If I may...

09:52.976 --> 09:56.444
It's routine for my generation
and either of the parties
involved

09:56.480 --> 10:00.098
to engage in relationships
that can last several years
entirely online.

10:00.117 --> 10:02.701
-In fact, in canada--
-okay, your honor. Must we?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.703
Young mr. Biswas has a point,
ms. Quinn.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.772
Mr. Callan, is your
co-counsel's assessment of
the evidence accurate or not?

10:07.791 --> 10:09.291
It is, your honor.

10:09.326 --> 10:12.944
And if the court is ready
to move the case to trial,
the people are ready.

10:12.963 --> 10:16.164
Good! Now, to avoid any
appearance of impropriety,

10:16.216 --> 10:19.283
the court recommends that
you separate residences
and cease communication

10:19.303 --> 10:20.618
for the duration of the trial.

10:20.637 --> 10:22.787
Not a problem.
I get the house.

10:22.806 --> 10:24.055
Are you serious right now?

10:24.091 --> 10:25.807
Well, then the least
your honor could do,

10:25.842 --> 10:27.458
is let the people stay
in her guest house.

10:27.477 --> 10:29.961
Sorry, that's another conflict
of interest.

10:29.980 --> 10:32.897
-Find a nice hotel.
I'll see you both in court.
-Yeah, sure.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.733
Wait, you all
hang out together?

10:40.524 --> 10:42.574
[indistinct conversation]

10:47.698 --> 10:48.596
excuse me.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.985
Hello. Uh, ms. Quinn, hi.

10:54.004 --> 10:56.421
I hope... I mean, I hope
there's not any

10:56.456 --> 10:58.540
hard feelings about...
[clears throat]

10:58.592 --> 11:01.659
...In there, because in
moot court in law school

11:01.678 --> 11:04.879
people got really, I mean,
really mad at me.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.099
Your fly is open.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.054
Touche.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.778
-That was a cheap trick,
quinn.
-It always works on you.

11:21.231 --> 11:23.181
-What happened?
-Bad case of acne.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.567
Never mind.
We gotta get ready for trial.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.370
You'll clerk for me and
the minute you pass the bar,

11:28.405 --> 11:30.872
-you're second chair.
-Ooh, I get the test results
back in a few days.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.874
-Warm up my seat.
-Okay.

11:38.081 --> 11:40.248
[emily]<i> so, um,</i>
<i> joaquin told me that</i>

11:40.300 --> 11:43.367
you basically started
the holistic law movement
back in brooklyn,

11:43.387 --> 11:45.303
and that is... Amazing.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.472
Well, the goal was to place
clients an alternative to

11:47.507 --> 11:49.040
prison facilities
like this one.

11:49.059 --> 11:50.541
So they get
actual rehabilitation.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.761
I come out here to check on
my clients as much as I can.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.230
I never had that kind of time
when I was a p.D.

11:55.265 --> 11:58.149
So let me guess, now you're
ready to do more.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.769
Defendants deserve more.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.605
Well, holistic law is not just
about defending clients.

12:03.657 --> 12:07.108
You represent them in
landlord-tenant disputes,
immigration proceedings,

12:07.160 --> 12:08.943
child custody battles,
divorce matters.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.229
Heck, I even make sure
they put food on the table.

12:11.248 --> 12:12.163
Yeah.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.951
That's my client, carla.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.070
She wants to work on
a garden center
when she gets out.

12:19.089 --> 12:20.955
Carla. This is emily.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.457
She's interested in
how I represent you.

12:25.128 --> 12:26.761
Wow.

12:26.797 --> 12:28.763
-Bite of lettuce?
-Oh, no, thanks.

12:28.799 --> 12:30.932
-Try it.
-But it's got, um...

12:31.885 --> 12:32.967
Yeah.

12:34.721 --> 12:35.603
[blows]

12:37.023 --> 12:38.690
[crunching]

12:40.894 --> 12:42.060
that's actually nice.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.063
Little dirty, but you know.
Not bad.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.318
[mark] gigi, the jurors need
to see you as the victim.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.820
Weak and vulnerable

12:51.872 --> 12:55.323
at the hands of 200-pound,
six-foot-one trained athlete.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.109
-Okay, so you want me to be
this delicate little flower?
-No, that's not--

12:58.128 --> 13:00.111
that's the only way those
12 idiots will believe me?

13:00.130 --> 13:02.113
Like it or not, those idiots

13:02.132 --> 13:04.382
are the only people who can
put pierce behind bars.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.118
I am not gonna change
who I am. Screw all of you.

13:07.137 --> 13:08.303
I need a smoke break.

13:10.006 --> 13:10.889
Move.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.562
She's gonna be
a disastrous witness.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.682
The jurors need to empathize
with her, not wanna strangle
her themselves.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.485
Meanwhile, tyler pierce
is mr. God damn congeniality.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.403
Well, I think that facts
should stand on their own.

13:25.438 --> 13:29.908
Teddy, in he-said-she-said
cases, who's more likeable
matters.

13:29.943 --> 13:33.411
Gigi raymond has 1.2 million
insta followers.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.030
-Someone likes her.
-Let me have some time
with her.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.031
[sighs]

13:37.450 --> 13:38.616
alone.

13:39.169 --> 13:40.168
Go.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.621
Is that a lot of followers?

13:45.342 --> 13:47.008
Look, gigi, you are very brave

13:47.043 --> 13:50.161
to be testifying and you have
every right to be angry--

13:50.180 --> 13:52.997
that sexist lawyer callan
is supposed to be on my side.

13:53.016 --> 13:56.384
Look, callan isn't sexist,
he's just...

13:56.436 --> 13:57.552
Frustrated.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.887
[cell phone chimes]

13:58.939 --> 14:01.189
gigi, this is your chance

14:01.224 --> 14:03.007
to face your attacker.

14:03.026 --> 14:05.109
Tell them what he did to you.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.778
How this affected you.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.113
Oh, you're my therapist, too?
[chuckles]

14:11.818 --> 14:15.320
did you ever think that some
of your followers might be
victims of violence?

14:16.406 --> 14:18.022
You can speak to them,

14:18.041 --> 14:19.574
help them.

14:19.626 --> 14:23.077
So that their lives
aren't destroyed or...
[scoffs] worse,

14:23.129 --> 14:24.045
ended.

14:25.048 --> 14:26.965
Stop just thinking
about yourself.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.333
Okay. Okay, I hear you.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.671
Now leave me alone to post
a pic of my bichon frise.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.226
Question.

14:38.261 --> 14:41.896
How do I get funding to start
a holistic law practice?

14:41.932 --> 14:43.982
You're gonna need to find
a powerful,

14:44.017 --> 14:47.569
well-funded legal organization
and expand their practice.

14:48.238 --> 14:49.938
What about bar panel?

14:49.990 --> 14:53.107
They would take over
my clients when there was
a conflict of interest.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.144
No, those private attorneys
are a bunch of...

14:56.179 --> 14:58.913
Yes, but the county
funds them. So they have
steady cash flow

14:58.949 --> 15:02.116
and plenty of clients
that they're actually in
a unique position to do this.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.452
-[carla] hey.
-Hi.

15:05.288 --> 15:07.005
So, hey, carla,
how'd you, um...

15:08.041 --> 15:08.957
How'd you end up here?

15:09.509 --> 15:11.759
My ruby was four months.

15:11.795 --> 15:14.512
I was out of work
and boosted some formula.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.799
-Shoved a security guard.
-She was headed to prison
for robbery.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.767
Her daughter would have gone
to foster care.

15:19.803 --> 15:23.187
But edith cut a deal for me
to come here instead.
I got to keep my ruby.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.108
-Aw.
-Gave me a reason to go on.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.144
[women arguing]

15:32.115 --> 15:33.314
[edith] no, whoa, whoa!

15:33.366 --> 15:36.434
Whoa! Get off, get off of her!
Get off!

15:36.453 --> 15:38.653
Stop! Hey, hey! Security!

15:38.705 --> 15:40.038
Get off of her!

15:40.073 --> 15:41.406
-Stop!
-[emily] come on!

15:42.375 --> 15:43.441
Get off!

15:43.460 --> 15:45.293
-[straining]
-security!

15:45.328 --> 15:48.612
-[exhales] yeah, yeah.
-Whoa, whoa. Are you okay?

15:48.632 --> 15:49.797
I can take a hit.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.666
Whoo!

15:51.718 --> 15:54.285
So, I guess you've had enough.

15:54.304 --> 15:57.422
What? What, that--
I'm gonna start my own
boxing gym.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.558
I mean, no.
I'm still committed to...

16:01.478 --> 16:02.510
Thank you.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.979
I'm still committed
to holistic law.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.801
Give bar panel a shot,
but don't hold your breath.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.353
You know, old dogs,
new tricks.

16:15.659 --> 16:16.908
[emily exhales]

16:16.943 --> 16:18.242
[softly] oh, my god...

16:20.914 --> 16:24.499
What happened physically
between you and mr. Pierce
that night?

16:24.534 --> 16:27.151
I was working it
like a badass.

16:27.170 --> 16:28.536
In control of things.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.822
So you and the defendant
were engaged
in sexual activities?

16:31.841 --> 16:35.009
Yeah, yeah. Some spanking,
some dirty talk,
I'm not vanilla.

16:35.045 --> 16:37.679
-It was fun.
-Was there a point at which
it stopped being fun?

16:37.714 --> 16:39.380
Yeah, isn't that why
we're all here?

16:42.686 --> 16:44.886
Out of nowhere, tyler--

16:44.938 --> 16:47.889
sorry, I mean,
the defendant, um...

16:48.942 --> 16:52.560
Grabbed me by the hair
and kept punching me

16:52.612 --> 16:55.029
over and over and over again.

16:55.065 --> 16:57.899
And his face, he was like...

16:57.934 --> 17:01.319
He was biting his lip like
he wanted to get the right
reaction out of me.

17:06.042 --> 17:07.408
[somber music playing]

17:08.128 --> 17:09.043
[smacks lips]

17:10.663 --> 17:14.165
but I wasn't scared shitless
the way he wanted, I guess.

17:16.086 --> 17:19.537
So he grabbed me by the throat
to, um,

17:19.556 --> 17:21.506
to strangle me
and just snap my neck.

17:26.062 --> 17:27.562
I thought he was
gonna kill me.

17:29.499 --> 17:31.215
[sobbing]

17:31.234 --> 17:32.350
I'm sorry.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.824
[keyboard clacking]

17:39.859 --> 17:41.725
you should really go home.

17:41.745 --> 17:44.746
I just read over
today's transcript.

17:44.781 --> 17:47.281
Our new stenographer
is flawless.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.951
-If it weren't for--
-sounding like
a movie preview.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.403
-[sighs]
-things can look really good
on paper.

17:52.422 --> 17:53.671
Well, speaking of which,

17:53.706 --> 17:55.923
I saw tyler pierce on
<i> the drew barrymore show</i>

17:55.959 --> 17:59.510
making his mother's
mac and cheese recipe.

17:59.546 --> 18:03.264
If we're working here,
I thought sweet, funny guys
were sweet, funny guys.

18:03.299 --> 18:07.518
-It will come down to who
the jury believes he is.
-[sighs]

18:07.554 --> 18:11.189
oh! I am walking out now
with a w.

18:12.108 --> 18:13.608
As in the world.

18:13.643 --> 18:16.760
-[laughing] good night.
-Good night.

18:16.780 --> 18:18.529
[keyboard clacking]

18:18.565 --> 18:19.781
[sighs wearily]

18:27.240 --> 18:29.373
-may I help you?
-Sherri kansky?

18:30.877 --> 18:33.127
We're here regarding
an investigation into

18:33.163 --> 18:36.697
alleged impropriety in
the election of
judge lola carmichael.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.918
There's gotta be some mistake.

18:42.138 --> 18:43.621
[water running]

18:43.640 --> 18:45.256
[doorbell ringing]

18:46.476 --> 18:48.342
[doorbell repeatedly rings]

18:49.179 --> 18:50.561
[groans loudly]

18:58.571 --> 19:01.572
-[doorbell ringing]
-what the hell?

19:08.781 --> 19:11.282
And I am still processing
how deputies from
the public integrity unit

19:11.317 --> 19:13.568
wound up peppering me
with questions
in my living room.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.537
-Really don't think there's--
-an election impropriety,
seriously?

19:16.573 --> 19:18.573
As if trying to hang on
to my seat wasn't
difficult enough.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.208
Your honor, I was as shocked
as you were.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.543
Oh, no. I think I was
a bit more shocked.

19:22.579 --> 19:25.746
The first I heard about
ms. Kansky's volunteer work
was this morning.

19:25.798 --> 19:29.717
It wasn't an official campaign
activity, but I am sure it was
above board.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.636
Those deputies were not
having it.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.304
That community center was
in the crenshaw district.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.755
Which we both know I won

19:34.807 --> 19:37.925
with record turn out,
I guess that looks so bad
someone reported it.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.927
I did assure the deputies
it was...

19:39.979 --> 19:41.429
Purely educational
in all partisan.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.547
So many people have doubts
around election integrity
nowadays,

19:43.566 --> 19:47.235
I wanted to teach them how
to fill out ballots.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.053
Explain how votes are counted.

19:49.072 --> 19:51.906
-I never--
-never what?

19:51.941 --> 19:54.225
-Uh...
-Come on, sherri.
There must've been something.

19:54.244 --> 19:56.410
No, no! Um...

19:56.446 --> 19:58.579
[sighs] some people were
complaining...

19:58.615 --> 20:01.565
About politicians
and the bureaucracy
around covid benefits.

20:01.584 --> 20:03.417
So I told them I'd make
a few calls.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.420
Help them collect what
they're owed, and help
get them rental assistance.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.539
Oh...

20:10.293 --> 20:11.158
"oh?"

20:12.428 --> 20:14.128
"oh" is right.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.463
I was trying to be of service.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.182
You were working for
my campaign.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.634
It looked like you were trying
to buy votes.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.602
You should've known better.

20:23.606 --> 20:26.590
-How did they leave it
with you?
-Um...

20:26.609 --> 20:28.425
The public integrity unit said
they would determine

20:28.444 --> 20:29.894
if the investigation would
proceed to a hearing.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.613
-You?
-Same.

20:32.649 --> 20:36.117
I cannot believe that this
could escalate.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.185
The election could
be nullified.

20:38.221 --> 20:40.905
I could lose my judgeship,
or credibility.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.957
[sherri] I need some air.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.543
-Sherri...
-[door slams]

20:46.496 --> 20:48.579
[dramatic music playing]

20:49.666 --> 20:50.581
[sighs]

21:08.401 --> 21:11.902
"former governess,
elizabeth dimarco
of la habra heights,

21:11.938 --> 21:15.639
married her employer,
then dismembered
and cooked him for dinner.

21:15.658 --> 21:17.024
1926."

21:17.076 --> 21:18.943
they do not make cases
like they used to.

21:20.163 --> 21:21.245
What do you think
of my new spot?

21:21.281 --> 21:23.364
It's great. If you got a thing
for mold.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.815
Let's keep looking.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.817
So, you are never gonna
believe this.

21:26.836 --> 21:30.371
-Last night, I'm at home--
-stop, I already heard.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.923
Sherri and the election.
My buddy jerome,
he's the night guard.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.158
He let the deputies off
last night.

21:34.177 --> 21:37.678
-Does everyone know?
-Relax, lo, it's just me.
Okay?

21:37.714 --> 21:40.431
But I have nagging suspicion
it's gonna be traced back to
corrine cuthbert,

21:40.466 --> 21:42.717
a serious case of sour grapes.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.385
How would she even know?

21:44.437 --> 21:47.104
I just don't understand how
sherri could make a mistake
like this.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.441
Devil's advocate.
Sherri thought she could
give the voters a little push,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.109
she'd do anything for you.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.196
No, mark, I trust sherri.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.183
Ms. Raymond,
the stunts you post,

21:59.202 --> 22:00.851
these keep getting
more outrageous

22:00.870 --> 22:03.204
to keep the million dollars
a year flowing, right?

22:03.239 --> 22:06.523
Yeah, I kick it up a notch
and I call them media
spectaculars.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.109
I see.

22:08.144 --> 22:10.194
Was kidnapping the dog of
k-pop star

22:10.213 --> 22:12.363
goldie ku one of
your media spectaculars?

22:12.382 --> 22:13.547
Objection irrelevance.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.916
Sustained on 352 grounds.

22:15.968 --> 22:19.587
I have an eight page document
titled "raymond pierce text
exchange"

22:19.639 --> 22:22.590
marked as defense exhibit e
for identification.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.309
-May I approach the witness?
-You may.

22:25.345 --> 22:29.096
Ms. Raymond, do you recognize
these text messages you sent
to the defendant

22:29.148 --> 22:32.383
between July 17th
and July 22nd of last year?

22:32.402 --> 22:33.601
Take your time.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.937
Mmm-hmm. I mean, uh, yeah.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.739
Could you please read
the highlighted text?

22:39.575 --> 22:41.075
-Out loud?
-Go ahead.

22:41.911 --> 22:43.027
Um, okay.

22:45.314 --> 22:46.914
[softly] "I'm your
obedient little slut."

22:46.949 --> 22:48.783
oh, speak up so
the jury can hear you.

22:49.419 --> 22:51.285
[indistinct chatter]

22:51.337 --> 22:55.506
[louder] "rough me up
until I'm black and blue
so I know I'm yours.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.242
I need to ache from being
used by you.

22:58.261 --> 23:00.761
I want you to choke me
until I cum for you."

23:00.797 --> 23:02.630
[amy] so you asked
the defendant
to rough you up,

23:02.682 --> 23:04.098
choke you, bruise you--

23:04.133 --> 23:06.300
-no, I never asked him to--
-no, that's right. Sometimes
you begged--

23:06.352 --> 23:07.852
-objection argumentative.
-Sustained.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.689
...Simply followed your
instructions to the letter
and yet here we all are.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.591
Players in one of your super
duper spectaculars.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.143
-Objection. Your honor,
this is--
-sustained.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.028
No. I just told
that piece of shit

23:18.064 --> 23:19.864
what he wanted to hear
to keep his interest,
all right?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.650
Everybody does that online.
You are just a frigid bitch.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.201
Enough, ms. Raymond.

23:25.288 --> 23:26.954
Let's just bring
the temperature down.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.540
The court will be in recess.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.543
[indistinct chatter]

23:32.578 --> 23:34.611
whoa, you really tried her.

23:34.630 --> 23:38.466
Ness, when you pass the bar,
you'll have to give your
clients a rigorous defense.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.384
Okay.

23:49.479 --> 23:50.794
After all that prep.

23:50.813 --> 23:52.563
[mimics explosion]
gigi sunk our case.

23:52.598 --> 23:53.797
Um, kind of busy here.

23:53.816 --> 23:55.816
Also, it's not over.

23:55.852 --> 23:58.152
You're right. Our expert
witness is up next.

23:58.187 --> 24:02.740
It's her job to convince those
jurors that their assumptions
about gigi are false.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.825
She is the victim, period.

24:04.861 --> 24:09.413
Strong strategy. According to
our demographics, jurors six,
seven, nine and 11

24:09.449 --> 24:11.081
are under 35.

24:11.117 --> 24:14.418
Statistically they're woke,
so victim blaming is out.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.370
Hey, I'm over 35. I'm...
I'm woke.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.089
[laughter]

24:24.597 --> 24:26.847
lunch? That's a nice surprise.

24:26.883 --> 24:27.848
[chuckles]

24:29.101 --> 24:32.386
oh, damn. I asked for
roast beef.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.523
Could anything go
my way today?

24:35.558 --> 24:38.609
I'm gonna say this is about
more than roast beef.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.895
-Cleared things up with emily?
-Okay, why would you think
that I'm talking about--

24:40.947 --> 24:42.196
the sandwich apocalypse.

24:43.533 --> 24:45.616
Surprise lunch.

24:45.651 --> 24:49.653
-Sure you're not here to talk?
-No. Emily and I are just
friends, double confirm.

24:50.456 --> 24:51.322
Great.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.575
So you're open to other women.

24:54.627 --> 24:58.128
'cause, uh, you seems like
you're lady catnip.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.750
-[laughter]
-uh-uh.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.752
I'm still proving myself at
the p.D.'s office.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.588
-Okay.
-No distractions.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.206
Suit yourself.

25:09.225 --> 25:12.142
If you don't want them,
I will take on the challenge.

25:16.933 --> 25:20.434
Dr. Cheng, you said you've
treated more than 200
victims of domestic abuse

25:20.486 --> 25:21.986
over the course of
your career.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.989
Would you say they always come
across the way we'd expect
a victim would?

25:25.024 --> 25:28.275
You mean the stereotype,
frightened, weak and helpless?

25:28.327 --> 25:32.830
-No.
-But isn't that the typical
response to injury, trauma?

25:32.865 --> 25:35.282
Quite the contrary.
When women are battered,

25:35.334 --> 25:39.403
they can have atypical
behavior. Anger driven
outbursts.

25:39.422 --> 25:42.573
They're often embarrassed
and don't want to admit
they're vulnerable.

25:42.592 --> 25:43.958
That they let this happen
to them.

25:44.010 --> 25:48.679
So it's possible for someone
to be battered and still be
brash,

25:48.714 --> 25:52.182
-abrasive, um, in your face.
-Absolutely.

25:52.218 --> 25:55.853
A false projection of strength
in the face of shame is
consistent

25:55.888 --> 25:57.421
with a ptsd reaction.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.774
Is it also possible for
a domestic abuser to

26:00.810 --> 26:03.193
come across as a nice guy,
even be a role model?

26:03.229 --> 26:07.281
You'd be shocked, who goes
home and beats up the person
they supposedly love.

26:07.316 --> 26:08.449
Thank you.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.034
[indistinct chatter]

26:10.069 --> 26:14.655
unfortunately the nice guys
can be villains strategy
resonates these days.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.123
I am a nice guy.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.275
This is ruining me.

26:18.294 --> 26:20.461
What I do behind closed doors
shouldn't matter.

26:20.496 --> 26:23.998
But it does. We have to show
the jury that at least you're
honest about what you want

26:24.050 --> 26:26.550
unlike, what,
half the married guys
on your team?

26:26.586 --> 26:28.636
Any history with
women's causes?

26:28.671 --> 26:33.140
I think I signed a hockey
stick for some fundraiser for
a breast thing.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.892
Ness, find that charity.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.510
Do you know how many
make a wishes I do?

26:37.063 --> 26:38.795
And what do I get?

26:38.814 --> 26:40.180
People taking advantage of me.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.266
[clears throat] okay, can I
talk to you for a second?

26:46.238 --> 26:48.689
If I bite my tongue any
harder, it is going to bleed.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.307
Now, he is the victim.

26:50.326 --> 26:52.910
By the time we're done with
him, he will be.

26:55.781 --> 26:56.997
Okay.

27:01.587 --> 27:02.986
And as you can see, gentlemen,

27:03.005 --> 27:05.706
recidivism in california
is at 46%.

27:05.758 --> 27:09.376
The los angeles county court
system is the largest in
the country.

27:09.428 --> 27:12.646
Defendants get utterly buried
in the bureaucracy.

27:12.682 --> 27:15.849
Look, I'm not here sprinkling
fairy dust.

27:15.885 --> 27:19.720
But I am offering holistic law
services to your clients
to help them

27:19.772 --> 27:21.772
solve their problems.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.775
Ms. Lopez,
I commend your enthusiasm.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.011
But I'm afraid the only way
your holistic law could work

27:28.030 --> 27:29.730
is by sprinkling fairy dust.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.116
What you're suggesting
is impractical. It's too
far reaching.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.517
And expensive.

27:33.536 --> 27:36.620
L.A. County gives us funding
to defend clients in
criminal court.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.038
That's our priority.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.740
You saw my analysis.

27:39.792 --> 27:43.410
Putting one defendant's child
into the foster care system

27:43.462 --> 27:47.131
costs the county far more than
offering these services.

27:47.166 --> 27:51.201
Caring for the whole person
is the future of criminal
defense.

27:51.220 --> 27:54.455
If you're interested in
social work, you might wanna
consider a career change.

27:54.490 --> 27:56.039
Or go do pro bono work.

27:56.058 --> 27:57.391
Try free council initiative.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.710
The lawyers there take shifts
cleaning the bathrooms.

27:59.729 --> 28:02.396
[all chuckle]

28:02.431 --> 28:03.647
well, I should have gone
there first.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.650
Thank you, gentlemen,
thank you for your time.

28:09.572 --> 28:12.990
And I signed a hockey stick
for the breast cancer
foundation.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.892
My aunt irene is a survivor.

28:15.911 --> 28:18.495
You are a very generous man.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.330
Do women ever take
advantage of you?

28:20.366 --> 28:24.084
You know, sometimes all they
want are vacations and cartier
watches.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.336
I try not to get jaded
but it gets to you.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.088
I'm a nice guy.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.073
No further questions.

28:30.092 --> 28:31.625
-Mark! Mark! Mark!
-What?

28:31.677 --> 28:32.909
Let me do the cross.

28:32.928 --> 28:35.379
-Sit down and be quiet.
-Mark, I've got this.

28:38.434 --> 28:40.100
This prodigy crap
better be real.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.936
Which way do I go?

28:42.972 --> 28:44.938
-[man whispers] what's wrong
with that guy?
-[teddy clears throat]

28:48.027 --> 28:49.593
[clears throat]

28:49.612 --> 28:51.478
mr. Pierce, excuse me.

28:52.615 --> 28:55.365
I-- I may not have, uh,
much experience

28:55.401 --> 28:58.101
if any in the boudoir

28:58.120 --> 29:00.370
-and--
-move along your questioning,
mr. Biswas.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.873
-Okay, um, orgasms.
-[crowd laugh]

29:02.908 --> 29:05.125
do women usually have, uh,

29:05.745 --> 29:07.661
one of those during sex?

29:08.547 --> 29:10.798
-Mr. Dinsmore?
-I'm so sorry.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.449
First I have
mr. Biswas saying,

29:12.468 --> 29:16.286
"I might not have much
experience or any
in the boudoir."

29:16.305 --> 29:18.806
then he says, "orgasms."

29:18.841 --> 29:23.477
-does a woman always have--
-mr. Biswas, repeat your
questioning for mr. Dinsmore

29:23.512 --> 29:25.896
but this time, speak up,
so he doesn't have to...

29:25.931 --> 29:28.649
Can you always tell
when a woman has had
an orgasm?

29:28.684 --> 29:30.901
With me, it's pretty obvious.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.569
Did ms. Raymond have
one with you?

29:32.605 --> 29:34.855
Oh, yeah. They all do.

29:34.907 --> 29:38.809
So ms. Raymond asked you
to choke her until she had
an orgasm,

29:38.828 --> 29:42.145
you said it was perfectly
clear that she had one.

29:42.164 --> 29:43.330
Yeah, so?

29:43.365 --> 29:45.999
And yet you kept on choking
her after she had an orgasm

29:46.035 --> 29:47.701
until she went unconscious.

29:47.753 --> 29:50.254
Was that part of your game or
do you get your kicks sending
women to the hospital?

29:50.289 --> 29:52.005
-No no, that's not--
-objection argumentative.

29:52.041 --> 29:53.757
-Sustained.
-No further questions.

29:56.796 --> 29:57.994
You know,
I'm gonna kill you, you--

29:58.013 --> 30:00.497
-[gavel banging]
-mr. Pierce, sit down.

30:00.516 --> 30:01.682
You know me.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.166
[indistinct chatter]

30:03.185 --> 30:05.052
-it was an accident.
-[gavel banging]

30:05.104 --> 30:07.971
[lola] order!
Bailiff, clear the courtroom.

30:08.858 --> 30:10.674
In my chambers, now.

30:10.693 --> 30:12.609
Chambers!

30:12.645 --> 30:14.978
[continues indistinctly]

30:18.033 --> 30:20.734
I will not have my courtroom
turned into a three
ring circus.

30:20.786 --> 30:25.172
Your honor, mr. Biswas' gotcha
grandstanding about the timing
of an orgasm

30:25.207 --> 30:28.208
doesn't prove my client
intended to hurt
ms. Raymond.

30:28.244 --> 30:31.378
It was a moment of passion
that went too far.
An accident. Period!

30:31.413 --> 30:34.965
One bruise is an accident,
your honor. We have all seen
the photos.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.800
Okay, your honor,
let's cut to the chase.

30:36.836 --> 30:40.370
The defense asked the court
to adjust the language
of the jury instructions.

30:40.389 --> 30:42.923
The jurors must be told to
consider ms. Raymond's

30:42.975 --> 30:44.474
obvious consent to this
s and m game.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.811
The people understand that
she agreed to a point but
that only goes so far.

30:47.847 --> 30:51.047
By ms. Quinn's logic,
if someone asks you
to push them off a bridge

30:51.066 --> 30:53.150
and you do it,
you bear no responsibility.

30:53.185 --> 30:57.387
The way the standard
jury instructions for domestic
violence charge is written,

30:57.406 --> 31:01.575
is flawed. Right now it
doesn't mention consent
being a mitigating factor.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.560
-Other battery laws do.
-Your honor,

31:03.579 --> 31:05.946
there are those who would say
adjusting jury instructions

31:05.998 --> 31:08.949
is how activist judges
overwrite laws to
influence juries

31:09.001 --> 31:10.617
towards a desired verdict.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.452
It happens all the time.
Look at the kyle rittenhouse--

31:12.504 --> 31:14.738
-oh! Back off, frodo.
-Enough!

31:14.757 --> 31:17.507
I am not here to override
laws. I'm here to ensure

31:17.543 --> 31:20.577
mr. Pierce receives
a fair trial.

31:20.596 --> 31:22.012
-That will be all.
-Judge carmichael,

31:22.047 --> 31:23.513
as a sworn officer
of the court,

31:23.549 --> 31:26.266
it is my moral obligation to
express my belief that

31:26.302 --> 31:29.636
tyler pierce will do this kind
of thing again and again
and again.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.689
And I know.

31:32.725 --> 31:35.091
I was bullied by guys
like him.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.276
My whole childhood.

31:40.816 --> 31:47.103
I feel for you, mr. Biswas,
and this is a serious matter.

31:47.122 --> 31:51.441
Now I will take the defense's
request to consider consent
under advisement.

31:51.460 --> 31:55.045
I will also mull over
the prosecution's position

31:55.080 --> 31:58.215
that the injuries mr. Pierce
inflicted on ms. Raymond

31:58.250 --> 32:00.550
be the only factor
they consider.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.885
Now, good afternoon.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.173
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

32:07.977 --> 32:09.009
[door closes]

32:13.032 --> 32:17.600
jurors, you are to consider
the following instructions
in your deliberation.

32:17.620 --> 32:22.539
The defendant is charged
in count one with felony
domestic violence.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.826
You must determine
whether mr. Pierce, one,

32:25.878 --> 32:29.296
willfully inflicted physical
injury upon ms. Raymond.

32:29.331 --> 32:33.834
And two, whether that injury
resulted in a traumatic
condition.

32:40.426 --> 32:44.011
Have a choco bite.
My go to during
jury deliberations.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.683
So, I did not grant
the defense's request for

32:49.735 --> 32:51.652
a pinpoint jury instruction.

32:51.687 --> 32:53.820
I hope I did the right thing.

32:53.856 --> 32:56.239
I think you did. Once you ask
a jury to accept

32:56.275 --> 32:58.575
that ms. Raymond yes to being
choked and punched,

32:58.610 --> 33:01.328
no 12 jurors will agree if
pierce went too far.

33:01.363 --> 33:02.829
But the defense makes
a good point.

33:02.865 --> 33:05.832
The jury instructions for
a felony domestic violence
charge

33:05.868 --> 33:07.534
as written is problematic.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.336
Lola, don't second
guess yourself.

33:09.371 --> 33:11.922
Who needs that with
judge marshall watching
over you

33:11.957 --> 33:14.624
and the whole election fiasco
on the horizon.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.677
My buddy jerome told me.

33:17.012 --> 33:18.495
Jerome?

33:18.514 --> 33:19.379
[cell phone chimes]

33:23.018 --> 33:24.601
the jury has a verdict.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.169
That was fast.

33:26.188 --> 33:29.189
Listen. Maybe nothing makes
a difference.

33:29.224 --> 33:32.859
That jury might see pierce as
some larger than life
superhero

33:32.895 --> 33:34.728
like a tom brady
or a michael jordan.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.447
And heroes can be
above the law.

33:38.867 --> 33:39.900
Thanks for the chat.

33:39.952 --> 33:42.703
Now you're used to hashing
things out with benner

33:42.738 --> 33:45.355
but I can be warm
and friendly, too. See?

33:45.374 --> 33:47.207
And take the cookies with you.

every year.

[solemn music playing]

34:07.596 --> 34:10.263

please stand?

34:26.832 --> 34:32.252

what's next?

35:09.324 --> 35:12.375
Well, my client has been
exonerated by a jury
of his peers

and now he can get back to
doing what he loves most.

Get me out of here.

Tyler, tyler, you are not
guilty but can you comment on
the breaking news

35:43.492 --> 35:45.808
that the l.A. Blades
are releasing
you from the team

Nope. Let's go.

I know I might have made
a mistake during the election.

36:38.881 --> 36:41.131
But you don't have to make me
feel so small.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.917
I am sorry, sherri.

36:43.969 --> 36:48.805
But even you have to admit,
that sometimes you can go
a little overboard.

It looks like they are moving
forward and calling a hearing.

37:10.746 --> 37:16.950
We will both have to testify
about your conduct during
the election.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.201
Are you sure you can trust me?

37:19.871 --> 37:21.621
I might go overboard.

Whoo. Circus has left town.

Come on. Let's go back

Oof.

Ness, whatever you're feeling
about the verdict,

37:40.192 --> 37:43.610
it was our job to make
the prosecution prove
their case.

-They couldn't get there.
-Yay! American justice.

37:46.782 --> 37:50.433
With rachel gone, I couldn't
have done this without you.
