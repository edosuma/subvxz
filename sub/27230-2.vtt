01:00.393 --> 01:02.020
[charging]

01:08.526 --> 01:09.569
[sighs]

01:21.664 --> 01:24.584
[Haggar] Commander Mar,
the emperor has been taken.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.212
The Voltron Paladins have betrayed him.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.215
-Track him down and return him to me.
-Vrepit Sa.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.368
[panting]

02:01.246 --> 02:02.580
[door opens]

02:05.041 --> 02:06.501
[door closes]

02:07.127 --> 02:11.005
-Have you any word from Commander Mar?
-[Macidus] Nothing, High Priestess.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.259
Communication with Commander Mar
has been lost.

02:14.592 --> 02:19.180
-What of Emperor Lotor's whereabouts?
-[Macidus] Still unknown.

02:34.737 --> 02:35.780
[gasps]

02:55.550 --> 02:56.718
[monitor beeping]

02:56.801 --> 02:58.720
[Zarkon] I don't see anything.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.182
Can it be true?

03:03.808 --> 03:07.020
-I am to be a father?
-Yes.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.564
And you, my queen...

03:09.814 --> 03:12.901
will be the mother
to the heir of the Galra throne.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.068
Yes.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.862
There is much to do.

03:15.945 --> 03:19.324
First, we must continue
to harvest the Quintessence.

03:20.074 --> 03:23.077
It will be needed for your son's empire.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.706
He will be the best of both our people.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.797
I will find you, my son.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.893
High Priestess, I am sorry to disturb you.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.479
Have you located Emperor Lotor?

03:49.562 --> 03:52.565
We still have not been able
to ascertain any information

03:52.649 --> 03:56.152
regarding Emperor Lotor,
Commander Mar, or Voltron.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.614
It has been phoebs
since Emperor Lotor disappeared.

03:59.697 --> 04:04.452
The empire is in a state of chaos.
The Blade of Marmora still challenges.

04:04.535 --> 04:08.456
We need a strong leader.
The Druids look to you, High Priestess.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.708
[Haggar] Tell them to look elsewhere.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.544
The Druids are but ash
in the winds of infinity.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.465
Let them be led
by someone of equal esteem.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.885
-Priestess...
-Depart my presence.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.229
What shall we name the boy?

04:31.771 --> 04:35.358
I was thinking a name
that has deep Altean history.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.901
Lotarious.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.820
Lotarious?

04:38.987 --> 04:42.365
He was one of the ancient Alteans
believed to have established

04:42.448 --> 04:46.160
much of the foundation
of the engineering that built our world.

04:47.495 --> 04:51.708
Interesting. I was considering
a name from mythology.

04:51.958 --> 04:56.296
Kaltor. But he did not build the worlds,
he conquered them.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.590
Perhaps we can honor both traditions.

05:00.717 --> 05:05.638
High Priestess, apologies. I was ordered
to notify you when Commander Mar returned.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.062
[heart monitor beeping]

05:16.691 --> 05:18.109
[Haggar] What happened to him?

05:18.192 --> 05:20.445
[Drick] I found him like this, near death.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.198
-What does he know?
-His vitals are weak.

05:24.282 --> 05:28.661
He has yet to regain consciousness.
We may never find out what he knows.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.289
There may be a way. Leave.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.544
[door opens, closes]

05:39.839 --> 05:42.050
Do you have news of the emperor?

05:43.259 --> 05:45.511
[grunts]

05:45.595 --> 05:46.846
Yes.

05:47.263 --> 05:51.100
-I located Lotor's generals.
-Where are they?

05:51.809 --> 05:57.273
They... they attacked me and took over
my ship, leaving me stranded.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.942
And what of the emperor?

06:01.861 --> 06:04.530
-[grunting, screaming]
-[monitor beeping rapidly]

06:08.451 --> 06:10.286
[screaming continues]

06:11.162 --> 06:13.456
And what of the emperor?

06:14.290 --> 06:18.211
The generals said Emperor Lotor
accessed the Quintessence Field.

06:18.961 --> 06:23.007
-He pierced the veil.
-But then Voltron attacked.

06:23.091 --> 06:26.344
The fight ended.
There was an explosion.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.971
Lotor and Voltron perished.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.724
[screaming]

06:34.811 --> 06:35.895
No.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.146
No.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.940
I must find him.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.277
Call forth the Kral Zera.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.242
[Zarkon grunts]

07:06.425 --> 07:08.845
Who... who are you?

07:10.638 --> 07:13.224
You do not recognize your emperor?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.310
Who...

07:16.894 --> 07:17.979
am I?

07:24.402 --> 07:28.114
-Where am I?
-Aboard your ship, sir.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.324
Take us home.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.369
I can't, sir.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.038
Daibazaal has been destroyed.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.085
Get a doctor to this room immediately.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.597
Excuse me, my empress.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.266
I just need to--
[gasps] What are you doing?

07:56.142 --> 07:58.186
I need you to let go of me.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.771
Please! Let go! [grunting]

08:00.855 --> 08:04.108
[shrieking]

08:06.277 --> 08:07.403
[door opens]

08:07.487 --> 08:11.657
Haggar! Haggar, can you hear me?
Haggar, answer me!

08:12.283 --> 08:13.659
Oh, no.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.245
Help! Send help now!

08:16.370 --> 08:17.538
Haggar.

08:22.084 --> 08:25.379
[doctor] Sire, the birth was difficult
but successful.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.590
Your son is healthy and in good shape,

08:27.673 --> 08:31.469
though we seem to be getting some
strange readings coming from him directly.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.639
Similar to those that, well...

08:34.722 --> 08:37.683
Similar to those of the empress
and yourself.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.779
[crying]

08:54.116 --> 08:55.701
Your son, sire.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.871
Take him away.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.541
-But--
-I said take him away!

09:05.336 --> 09:06.420
[Zarkon] And what of her?

09:07.547 --> 09:08.881
[doctor] I'm sorry, sire.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.093
We have her under constant watch,
but she remains in this state.

09:12.176 --> 09:15.221
She only seems to become aware
when we administer her Quintessence.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.349
I'm hopeful her condition
will improve with time, but...

09:18.432 --> 09:22.436
Sire, we're gonna have to face the fact
that our Quintessence supplies are finite.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.106
The empire cannot continue to run
on what we have.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.984
And you and the Empress...
without it, you'll--

09:28.067 --> 09:29.610
Give me the room.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.074
[door opens, closes]

09:35.157 --> 09:37.243
Do you know who I am?

09:38.035 --> 09:40.830
You are emperor.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.291
And you?

09:43.874 --> 09:46.294
Ha-- Haggar?

09:47.461 --> 09:50.381
Do you know of Quintessence?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.259
Quintessence.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.846
Can you find me Quintessence?

09:59.515 --> 10:02.977
Yes, my emperor.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.195
I am lighting the flame.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.531
Bow now,
and your allegiance will be remembered.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.242
My fleet would crush yours in an instant,

10:18.326 --> 10:21.787
raining fire and death
upon you and your clansmen.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.206
What makes you think
I would ever bow to you?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.834
Because I have the witch's favor.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.294
[gasping]

10:30.838 --> 10:34.800
It matters not.
Power rules absolute.

10:35.009 --> 10:38.304
I invite you to challenge me
once the ceremony has begun.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.847
A display of the witch's magic

10:39.930 --> 10:43.184
will bolster my claim
as nothing else could.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.477
The Archivist!

10:46.103 --> 10:48.606
And your witch is nowhere to be found.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.778
[gasping, groans]

11:02.536 --> 11:07.708
This flame represents Lotor,
son of Zarkon,

11:07.792 --> 11:12.713
prince turned emperor,
emperor that pierced the veil.

11:13.214 --> 11:17.510
And my Altean blood
coursed through his veins.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.930
But the Galra Empire failed him.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.932
It was the Galra blood,

11:23.015 --> 11:27.478
deeply boiled in traditions of evil,
that tainted him.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.731
Your ways weakened a god.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.484
-That treacherous witch!
-[all yelling]

11:33.943 --> 11:39.407
The empire is weak.
And now, I will end it.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.329
What's this?

11:50.709 --> 11:52.628
[screaming]

11:53.921 --> 11:55.631
[screaming]

11:55.840 --> 11:57.716
[all screaming]

12:22.199 --> 12:25.953
Dayak, update me on the prince's progress.

12:26.245 --> 12:30.541
Yes, sire. Prince Lotor completed
the Agotian Trials as you requested.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.502
He was successful, even though
they were advanced for his age.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.754
What else?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.549
His physical stature is below expectation

12:38.632 --> 12:40.759
for the blood lineage
of the Galra royalty,

12:40.843 --> 12:44.388
but his tactical scores
are the highest we've ever measured.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.808
All I do, I do in the name of Galra.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.564
Father, there's a question
I've been wanting to ask you.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.026
Greatest apologies, sire.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.528
This one should not be speaking
out of place.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.989
Proceed.

13:02.156 --> 13:06.869
I would like to know about my mother.
Please, Father, what happened to her?

13:07.870 --> 13:10.915
I will tell you this and no more.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.626
She was my only weakness.

13:14.418 --> 13:17.046
But now she is gone.

13:17.379 --> 13:20.633
-What was her name? What was she like?
-Enough.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.552
Please, Father,
I must know who I come from.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.554
I said enough!

13:27.014 --> 13:31.936
If you do not remove his impurities,
then I will find a Dayak that can.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.064
He will be punished accordingly.

13:35.147 --> 13:39.568
We will sear him down to his inner fire
so that he may burn the universe.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.945
Vrepit Sa!

14:07.513 --> 14:08.597
[purring]

14:10.975 --> 14:12.059
[meows]

14:18.857 --> 14:19.900
[gasps]

14:37.293 --> 14:38.168
[screams]

14:40.337 --> 14:41.463
My son.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.306
Sire, your audience is requested
in the Kandar Wing.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.058
Father, may I accompany you?

14:53.225 --> 14:55.185
You will stay here.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.604
But I want to join you.

14:56.687 --> 15:00.190
-I have learned much of our--
-You are an insolent boy.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.861
You may be the prince,
but I am your emperor.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.328
[purring]

15:17.499 --> 15:20.085
Do not touch him. He will hurt you.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.172
What is his name?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.174
He has no name.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.802
Then I shall name it. Your name will be...

15:29.428 --> 15:31.055
[Honerva] It is only Kova.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.057
Kova.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.100
His name is Kova.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.394
[giggles]

15:37.478 --> 15:40.064
This creature pleases me.
It will be mine.

15:40.147 --> 15:40.981
My lord...

15:41.482 --> 15:44.068
You may be the high priestess,
but I am your prince,

15:44.151 --> 15:46.153
and you will do as I say.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.113
-Isn't that right, Kova?
-[purrs]

15:49.323 --> 15:50.741
Yes, my lord.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.433
What are you doing here?

16:16.892 --> 16:17.726
Answer me!

16:20.854 --> 16:23.732
I am Honerva of the planet Altea.

16:25.734 --> 16:30.322
That is impossible.
Altea was destroyed over 10,000 years ago.

16:30.739 --> 16:35.160
A powerful portent that is shared
with the birth of my son Lotor.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.079
Lotor's mother?

16:38.789 --> 16:40.416
Lotor is gone.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.544
[all gasping]

16:44.878 --> 16:46.130
How did he die?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.508
Voltron.

16:50.884 --> 16:54.805
To all of you who believed in my son
so justly,

16:54.888 --> 16:57.307
your faith will be rewarded.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.520
I have come here today
to continue my son's mission.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.148
And for that, I need you all.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.817
We are your humble servants,

17:06.900 --> 17:08.986
as will be the members
of our sister colony

17:09.069 --> 17:11.071
once we inform them of the news.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.906
Do you know of their whereabouts?

17:13.032 --> 17:17.411
Unfortunately, they have also fallen
to the evils of Voltron.

17:18.287 --> 17:22.082
Voltron and the Galra will pay
for what they have done.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.836
With your help,
I will resurrect my son's dream.

17:27.379 --> 17:31.592
We pledge our allegiance to you,
Honerva, mother of Lotor.

17:52.654 --> 17:56.700
[Honerva] This ancient land was created
through powerful magic.

17:56.784 --> 18:00.662
Alteans would travel here
to learn the secrets of our race.

18:00.996 --> 18:04.124
We have a long
and difficult road ahead of us,

18:04.208 --> 18:06.126
but our path is true.

18:06.835 --> 18:10.005
We will do anything to bring Lotor back.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.924
I know.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.694
[Merla] The acolytes have worked
tirelessly.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.031
-The prototype is ready.
-Excellent work.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.326
Find me the most faithful amongst us.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.245
Yes, my queen.

18:55.050 --> 18:58.137
-Are you nervous?
-No, Ven'tar.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.639
This is my chance
to finally make a difference,

19:00.722 --> 19:03.517
to show my father what we are capable of.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.646
[crowd cheering]

19:18.115 --> 19:20.200
Update me on your progress.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.912
Our Quintessence yields
are some of the highest in the empire,

19:23.996 --> 19:26.206
and we've been more efficient
than any other.

19:26.707 --> 19:30.210
By working alongside the denizens
of this planet, like Ven'tar here,

19:30.294 --> 19:31.128
we've outsourced--

19:31.211 --> 19:35.716
You dare work with this pitiful race
as if they are your equals?

19:36.717 --> 19:40.637
It is working. We have outpaced
even the most generous projections.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.807
The heir to the Galra throne
should not sully our honor

19:43.891 --> 19:46.602
by working with his subjects!

19:47.978 --> 19:51.440
It is the way my mother's people
would have done things.

19:55.068 --> 19:59.114
You thought I couldn't find out
about my own mother? About her people?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.533
You thought you destroyed
every remnant of Altea,

20:01.617 --> 20:04.578
but you cannot unless you destroy
your own son as well!

20:04.745 --> 20:06.079
Enough!

20:06.163 --> 20:09.416
You are to crush this planet
beneath your heel!

20:09.791 --> 20:10.751
Never!

20:10.876 --> 20:12.961
Then I will!

20:13.503 --> 20:14.338
You wouldn't.

20:15.005 --> 20:18.050
You can't! Father, wait!

20:19.176 --> 20:20.761
No, please do not do this, Father.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.639
Do not make these people suffer
for my actions.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.850
It is already done.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.979
I will do as you ask.
The people will serve the Galra.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.899
[screams]

20:40.781 --> 20:41.698
[gasps]

20:43.825 --> 20:44.952
No.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.453
No!

20:51.041 --> 20:54.086
You are hereby banished from the empire.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.421
Forced to live out the remainder
of your days

20:56.505 --> 20:59.132
remembering your failure here.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.307
Have you nothing to say, witch?

21:07.391 --> 21:10.894
Surely even you can see the folly
of your master's actions.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.191
Commander Sendak.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.987
The Lions of Voltron have arrived
as you suspected.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.614
Shall I capture them for you,
High Priestess?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.033
No. Destroy them.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.244
Vrepit Sa.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.290
[door opens, closes]

21:33.500 --> 21:35.419
Voltron has been found.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.798
It is time to test
our first Altean acolyte.

21:41.341 --> 21:46.722
Today, the light of the universe
shines inside our most brave.

21:46.888 --> 21:50.726
The dream of life is realized
through her actions.

21:51.268 --> 21:54.104
For Luca, the first acolyte,

21:54.187 --> 21:58.025
we shine in Lotor's bright luminescence!

22:03.030 --> 22:05.532
Voltron will pay for what they have done.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.951
May the light guide you.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.621
Rise and avenge my son.
