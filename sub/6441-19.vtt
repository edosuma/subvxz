WEBVTT

00:05.361 --> 00:07.198
Okay, okay, here we go.

00:07.198 --> 00:09.063
Oh yeah.

00:12.822 --> 00:15.522
Sorry, guys, but the coffee
here is strictly non-Irish.

00:15.522 --> 00:17.121
Oh, come on, loosen up.

00:17.121 --> 00:19.220
Yeah, have a drink!

00:19.220 --> 00:23.642
If that's what I think it is,
you're gonna have to take it outside.

00:23.642 --> 00:27.040
Besides we're closing.

00:34.885 --> 00:36.716
Can I get you anything else?

00:36.716 --> 00:38.685
Just a boyfriend who can keep a date.

00:38.685 --> 00:43.339
You're definitely talking to the wrong person.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:56.830 --> 00:59.388
Dr. Bryce, are you sure you're okay?

00:59.388 --> 01:02.957
Yeah, I just thought I saw someone I knew.

01:02.957 --> 01:06.679
But it's late. I better be going.
Thanks, Lana.

01:06.679 --> 01:10.324
No problem. Bye.

01:11.390 --> 01:12.803
Go get her.

01:12.803 --> 01:15.531
Hey.

01:16.475 --> 01:20.534
We heard this place had
the friendliest service in town.

01:20.534 --> 01:21.569
Just leave.

01:21.569 --> 01:26.604
Ah. That's no way
to talk to a customer.

01:28.926 --> 01:30.304
Hey!

01:30.304 --> 01:32.774
Aaah!

01:39.252 --> 01:42.949
Why don't we take this into the back
and have a private party?

01:42.949 --> 01:47.051
Stop! Get away from her!

01:50.901 --> 01:55.021
Isn't it past your bedtime?

01:56.358 --> 02:01.271
Look, the police are on their way.
Right now.

02:01.580 --> 02:05.091
Come on. Let's go.

02:16.091 --> 02:18.596
Lana, are you okay?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.721
Yeah.

02:25.676 --> 02:29.985
- Did you see the stupid look on her face?
- Yeah!

02:31.992 --> 02:34.361
Check out Speedy Gonzalez.

02:34.361 --> 02:38.035
I don't want to see any of you
in the Talon again. Got it?

02:38.035 --> 02:39.663
Listen, John Boy.

02:39.663 --> 02:42.128
We'll do whatever the hell we want.

02:42.128 --> 02:47.104
As a matter of fact, we were thinking
about stopping by tomorrow.

02:47.104 --> 02:48.422
I won't tell you again.

02:48.422 --> 02:52.799
Oh, I get it. You got
the hots for that bitch manager.

02:52.799 --> 02:56.947
It's too bad she's
a real dirty slut.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.123
All right. You want to
try it on, farm boy?

03:09.123 --> 03:11.802
Let's see what you're made of.

03:14.331 --> 03:18.558
Get your coffee somewhere else.

03:32.820 --> 03:35.053
On your knees.

04:46.158 --> 04:49.026
So you're the new sheriff in town.

04:49.026 --> 04:52.251
You writing a book, Mr. Kent?

04:53.176 --> 04:55.695
No, ma'am.

04:55.695 --> 04:59.831
Then keep the chitter chatter to yourself.

05:03.301 --> 05:06.282
Flying boys.

05:06.563 --> 05:11.046
Flying boys aren't something
you see every day.

05:11.046 --> 05:14.123
That young man told me
you attacked him and his friends,

05:14.123 --> 05:16.353
then you threw him 30 feet onto my car.

05:16.353 --> 05:17.600
That's crazy.

05:17.600 --> 05:24.495
Then how come the paramedics were all over
them and there's not a scratch on you, huh?

05:24.495 --> 05:27.154
What about you, Miss Lang?

05:28.110 --> 05:30.735
What'd you see?

05:31.283 --> 05:33.292
Nothing.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.642
You're lying, you know.

05:35.642 --> 05:37.993
Excuse me?

05:37.993 --> 05:42.121
You said you made a good cappuccino.

05:42.121 --> 05:47.787
This is a great cappuccino.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.763
- Looks like we're done here.
- No, Mr. Kent.

05:52.763 --> 05:55.116
Mnh-mnh.

05:55.116 --> 05:58.175
We are just getting started.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.453
Sheriff, we know our son and

06:03.453 --> 06:05.114
Clark would never deliberately hurt anybody.

06:05.114 --> 06:08.284
I'm sure whatever he did,
he did it 'cause he thought he had to.

06:08.284 --> 06:12.940
By throwing another young man
across my police car?

06:12.940 --> 06:16.064
I ran a complete check on your son, Mr. Kent.

06:16.064 --> 06:19.033
He's been at more crime
scenes than Eliot Ness.

06:19.033 --> 06:23.508
If Clark's been involved with police business,
it's only because he was trying to help people.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.615
Or maybe he's got some
kind of hero complex?

06:25.615 --> 06:27.644
I mean, even heroes got to play by the rules.

06:27.644 --> 06:30.379
And that is why I'm charging him
with misdemeanor battery.

06:30.379 --> 06:32.014
What exactly does that mean?

06:32.014 --> 06:34.660
Could be a $1500-dollar fine.
Depends on the judge.

06:34.660 --> 06:37.569
I'm sorry, but we can't afford that.

06:37.569 --> 06:41.235
Clark, sit down.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.749
I'll make you a deal, Mr. Kent.

06:49.749 --> 06:53.851
I won't charge you if you are
willing to do the community service,

06:53.851 --> 06:57.386
and then you can keep the world
save from roadside litter.

06:57.386 --> 06:58.760
Wait just a minute, how--

06:58.760 --> 07:00.617
Your former sheriff?

07:00.617 --> 07:04.046
He may have looked way the
other way on these matters,

07:04.046 --> 07:05.941
but I'm here to tell you.

07:05.941 --> 07:10.224
Those good ol' boy days are over.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.822
Nighty-night.

07:47.324 --> 07:51.754
Metropolis Flower Show, 1999.
You couldn't take your eyes off of them.

07:51.754 --> 07:53.656
Paul?

07:53.656 --> 07:55.945
Dr. Bryce.

07:55.945 --> 07:58.115
I thought I saw you last night.

07:58.115 --> 07:59.314
You did.

07:59.314 --> 08:05.093
And I was gonna say hi, but it was really late
and you didn't look like you wanted any company.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.160
What are you doing in Smallville?

08:07.160 --> 08:09.200
I'm here on business,

08:09.200 --> 08:13.149
and I read that you were getting married.

08:13.149 --> 08:15.459
You shouldn't believe everything you read.

08:15.459 --> 08:17.988
Right now, Lex and I are
married to our careers.

08:17.988 --> 08:20.475
At least that's what we tell each other.

08:20.475 --> 08:25.020
Lex. I'd like you to meet
an old friend of mine, Paul Hayden.

08:25.020 --> 08:27.273
Hey.

08:27.686 --> 08:30.600
I take it you two knew each
other from Metropolis.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.557
Well, we actually dated for
a while in med school

08:34.557 --> 08:37.971
until we realized we weren't
gonna live happily ever after.

08:37.971 --> 08:41.620
At least not with each other.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.359
Well, Paul it was nice seeing you.

08:47.359 --> 08:49.861
- Lex and I are just on our way out to lunch.
- Actually,

08:49.861 --> 08:53.483
I stopped by to tell you
I can't make it. I'm sorry.

08:53.483 --> 08:58.761
Well, maybe I can fill in?
You know, if it's okay with Lex.

08:58.761 --> 09:03.257
I'm sure you two have
a lot of catching up to do.

09:06.552 --> 09:09.930
Patient emergency. I'll have to
take a rain check on that lunch.

09:09.930 --> 09:14.329
Why don't you give Lex the number where you're
staying and we'll make a plan to get together?

09:14.329 --> 09:17.456
Yeah, sounds great.

09:22.365 --> 09:24.738
Same old Helen.

09:24.738 --> 09:29.729
One minute she's here,
the next she's gone.

09:30.017 --> 09:32.932
Hang on to her Lex...

09:32.932 --> 09:35.730
if you can.

09:38.231 --> 09:39.580
Clark Kent, convict.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.329
Yeah, I know, when do you get
fit for that orange jump suit?

09:42.329 --> 09:44.481
Or is it one size fits all?

09:44.481 --> 09:47.299
Forty hours of community
service is not funny.

09:47.299 --> 09:48.461
It's an orange vest.

09:48.461 --> 09:51.090
Oh, no! It's gonna
clash with the plaid!

09:51.090 --> 09:54.639
Welcome to Smallville, where you
stop the crime, you do the time.

09:54.639 --> 09:58.460
Very pithy.

09:58.743 --> 10:03.266
Maybe I should use that
as my campaign slogan, huh?

10:03.591 --> 10:07.613
Oh. We're gonna see you
bright and early, Mr. Kent.

10:07.613 --> 10:09.040
I'm looking forward to it.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.456
Yeah.
Tootle-oo.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.846
Good luck on the chain gang.

10:19.078 --> 10:22.630
Hey, Lana.
What's wrong?

10:22.630 --> 10:25.463
According to the sheriff I don't
have a case that'll hold up in court.

10:25.463 --> 10:28.973
It's all hearsay.

10:29.794 --> 10:31.411
At least you were there, Clark.

10:31.411 --> 10:34.250
Yeah. Look where it got me.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.789
Sorry.

10:41.566 --> 10:45.522
So, how'd you do it, Clark?

10:45.522 --> 10:51.975
I mean, I know you can take care of yourself,
but there were three of them.

10:51.975 --> 10:55.818
They were drunk.

10:55.818 --> 10:57.491
And I was highly motivated.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.406
I mean, the thought of
someone hurting you...

11:00.406 --> 11:04.129
You can't keep your eye
on my every second.

11:04.409 --> 11:07.728
I can try.

11:07.728 --> 11:11.775
You're always there to save me.

11:11.775 --> 11:16.710
I just wish for once
I could've saved myself.

11:41.351 --> 11:43.549
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

11:43.549 --> 11:46.152
No, it's okay. I guess
I'm still a little jumpy.

11:46.152 --> 11:48.704
It's understandable.
You had quite an ordeal.

11:48.704 --> 11:51.232
I just feel so stupid.
It's not like I was even hurt.

11:51.232 --> 11:54.080
No, no, this place has always
been a safe haven for you.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.164
Now that's been violated.

11:56.164 --> 11:59.983
So now what?
Become a shut-in?

12:00.653 --> 12:03.220
Lana, I know what it's
like to feel vulnerable.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.033
You?

12:05.298 --> 12:09.672
Trust me. Eccentric bald kids sit pretty low
on the prep school totem pole.

12:09.672 --> 12:14.757
I was bullied for years,
till one day I decided I had enough.

12:14.757 --> 12:16.496
What'd you do?

12:16.496 --> 12:20.135
One of my father's chauffeurs
was an ex-Navy SEAL.

12:20.135 --> 12:24.160
I convinced him to teach me to fight.

12:24.160 --> 12:29.330
Let's just say the next time I was cornered the
guy ended up needing serious dental work.

12:29.330 --> 12:30.907
I could never hurt anybody.

12:30.907 --> 12:32.950
It's not about hurting people.

12:32.950 --> 12:37.238
It's about reclaiming your sense
of control over your life.

12:37.238 --> 12:40.246
Isn't that what you want?

12:44.886 --> 12:47.287
One million dollars.

12:47.287 --> 12:49.326
The sheriff said he had
a few cuts and bruises.

12:49.326 --> 12:51.724
Now he's claiming to have
severe neck injury.

12:51.724 --> 12:54.550
"Punitive damages, pain and suffering,
loss of future earnings"?

12:54.550 --> 12:57.525
They're saying Andy's mobility
may be permanently limited and

12:57.525 --> 12:59.885
they've hired the best personal
injury attorney in the state.

12:59.885 --> 13:03.640
You did throw him into that car, Clark.

13:04.965 --> 13:06.778
Maybe this is where it all starts.

13:06.778 --> 13:08.236
Remember what it said in the spaceship?

13:08.236 --> 13:12.370
"They're a flawed race.
Rule them with strength."

13:14.208 --> 13:16.233
Son,

13:16.233 --> 13:19.311
I got into a lot of fights when
I was your age too, believe me.

13:19.311 --> 13:23.098
But, Clark, these are not alien feelings.

13:23.098 --> 13:28.363
What you have to remember under these
circumstances is that there are consequences.

13:28.363 --> 13:29.350
Your father's right.

13:29.350 --> 13:33.179
You don't make decisions in a split second
you have to live with for the rest of your life.

13:33.179 --> 13:36.130
Clark, it's true.
We are a flawed race, sure.

13:36.130 --> 13:39.496
But we're a flawed race that raised you.

13:39.496 --> 13:43.340
You're a lot more human than you think.

14:03.845 --> 14:07.571
Lex, it still won't start.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.745
How far way are you?

14:14.028 --> 14:15.529
Okay.

14:15.529 --> 14:18.816
I'll see you in a sec.

14:23.523 --> 14:25.936
You always had the worst luck with cars.

14:25.936 --> 14:28.447
Paul.

14:30.443 --> 14:32.094
What are you doing here?

14:32.094 --> 14:33.992
It must be kismet.

14:33.992 --> 14:36.741
I dropped my cell phone, came back
to get it, and here you were.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.226
How about I give you a ride home?

14:38.226 --> 14:39.753
Lex is on his way.

14:39.753 --> 14:43.453
Come on, Helen, why wait?

14:45.051 --> 14:48.109
Same old Helen.

14:48.109 --> 14:49.991
Never wanted my help.

14:49.991 --> 14:51.458
Must be different with Lex, huh?

14:51.458 --> 14:54.997
Yes, it is.

14:57.637 --> 15:00.918
Here comes Prince Charming now.

15:00.918 --> 15:02.786
Helen,

15:02.786 --> 15:04.160
is everything all right?

15:04.160 --> 15:07.914
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah? Hey.

15:07.914 --> 15:11.586
Hello, Paul.
I didn't expect to see you here.

15:11.586 --> 15:13.689
I happened to be in the neighborhood.

15:13.689 --> 15:19.077
Twice in one day. Three times
if you count last night.

15:19.077 --> 15:21.695
Careful. I might start to think
you're stalking my girlfriend.

15:21.695 --> 15:23.129
Come on, let's go.

15:23.129 --> 15:25.696
Why would I want to do that?

15:25.696 --> 15:27.843
You're not over her.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.101
I was just trying to be a good Samaritan.

15:30.101 --> 15:32.061
So when my mechanic looks over this car,

15:32.061 --> 15:36.032
he's not gonna find missing spark plugs
or sugar in the gas tank?

15:36.032 --> 15:38.377
Lex, enough.

15:38.377 --> 15:41.145
You really are paranoid.

15:41.145 --> 15:43.268
No.

15:43.268 --> 15:48.256
No, I'm just a frighteningly
good judge of character.

15:48.503 --> 15:53.640
I strongly suggest you stay away from Helen.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.832
Whoa. Is that a threat?

15:57.605 --> 16:01.921
You seem like a simple guy, Paul.

16:01.921 --> 16:06.514
I'd hate for your life to get complicated.

16:57.754 --> 17:00.626
He's back at the motel, Mr. Luthor.

17:09.986 --> 17:13.007
You know I love you, Helen.

17:15.604 --> 17:20.762
And you know that I would do
anything to be with you.

17:21.829 --> 17:26.232
I do mean anything.

17:49.297 --> 17:50.683
Paul.

17:50.683 --> 17:52.874
Helen...

17:52.874 --> 17:54.687
What happened to you?

17:54.687 --> 17:57.672
Lex.

17:58.718 --> 18:01.772
Lex did this to me.

18:15.807 --> 18:19.524
Lex, we need to talk.

18:25.586 --> 18:26.996
What's going on?

18:26.996 --> 18:28.684
Paul claims you had him beaten up.

18:28.684 --> 18:32.214
And from the tone of your voice,
it sounds like you believe him.

18:32.214 --> 18:34.242
For two weeks now you've
been ignoring me.

18:34.242 --> 18:36.052
Suddenly Paul shows up
and your jealous.

18:36.052 --> 18:38.328
I'm not jealous. I'm concerned.

18:38.328 --> 18:41.801
Especially about someone who's
unhinged enough to do that to himself.

18:41.801 --> 18:44.773
Helen, he's clearly stalking you.

18:44.773 --> 18:47.876
You know, I don't understand it.
I mean, we were never that serious.

18:47.876 --> 18:51.501
It was a relationship of convenience.
There was no heavy emotional involvement.

18:51.501 --> 18:54.473
Could've fooled him.

18:55.077 --> 18:57.849
- Who broke it off?
- I did.

18:57.849 --> 19:00.859
One of his ex-girlfriends warned
me to stay away from him.

19:00.859 --> 19:03.837
She claimed that he beat her up.

19:03.837 --> 19:05.585
Did she ever report him to the police?

19:05.585 --> 19:09.745
No. But I wasn't gonna wait around
to see if history repeated itself.

19:09.745 --> 19:12.994
So I broke it off and we
never spoke after that.

19:12.994 --> 19:16.009
Three months later
he dropped out of school.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.927
Mr. Luthor.

19:19.927 --> 19:24.120
You're just the man I was looking for.

19:25.260 --> 19:27.282
I didn't have Paul Hayden beaten up.

19:27.282 --> 19:30.048
You know, I usually like to ask the
questions before I get the answers.

19:30.048 --> 19:33.585
Kind of the natural flow of things.
Where were you earlier this evening?

19:33.585 --> 19:35.826
At home.
A fact my staff can confirm.

19:35.826 --> 19:39.099
Uh-huh, so you did not threaten Paul
Hayden in the medical center parking lot?

19:39.099 --> 19:40.141
He's stalking my girlfriend.

19:40.141 --> 19:42.487
Well, according to him, he offered
her some flowers, a ride home.

19:42.487 --> 19:44.018
That's not exactly criminal behavior.

19:44.018 --> 19:47.404
Listen, Sheriff, if you want to play Letter
of the Law, you go right ahead.

19:47.404 --> 19:50.274
I just hope your professional instincts
lead you back in the right direction.

19:50.274 --> 19:52.481
Oh, don't worry.

19:52.481 --> 19:55.381
They always do, Mr. Luthor.

19:55.381 --> 19:58.275
I'll stay in touch.

20:34.807 --> 20:37.925
- Good morning, Clark.
- Look, don't even start.

20:37.925 --> 20:41.431
I've had half of Smallville High out here
already giving me a hard time.

20:41.431 --> 20:45.115
Would it be, uh, violating your parole
to take a coffee break?

20:45.115 --> 20:47.958
It'd be the least of my problems.

20:47.958 --> 20:50.203
That kid who harassed Lana is suing us.

20:50.203 --> 20:51.600
He could literally take the farm.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.344
It's hard to believe someone could come
into your life and just screw it up.

20:55.344 --> 20:59.805
Lana's a wreck, I'm picking up trash,
and this guy's walking around free.

20:59.805 --> 21:02.218
I wouldn't worry too much about Lana.

21:02.218 --> 21:04.162
Why's that?

21:04.162 --> 21:10.148
Let's just say the crouching tigress
is about to find her hidden dragon.

21:12.221 --> 21:14.594
I can't even get the bag to move.

21:14.594 --> 21:16.929
I don't see how I'm supposed to take
on a guy who's twice my size.

21:16.929 --> 21:20.375
Lana, getting the upper
hand isn't about size.

21:20.375 --> 21:22.818
It's about decisiveness and speed.

21:22.818 --> 21:24.564
You have to commit.

21:24.564 --> 21:26.517
Look, right now you're only
putting part of yourself into it.

21:26.517 --> 21:28.788
If you want to effective,

21:28.788 --> 21:31.051
you have to put your
whole body into it.

21:31.051 --> 21:33.481
- Okay?
- Okay.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.174
There you go. That's it.
Now channel all your anger.

21:40.174 --> 21:43.713
Some of us aren't as
angry as you are, Lex.

21:43.713 --> 21:45.248
Of course not.

21:45.248 --> 21:49.470
I mean, what's to be angry about?
Hmm?

21:49.470 --> 21:54.974
It's not like a bunch of frat boys came
into your own place and harassed you.

21:54.974 --> 21:58.903
It's not like you felt helpless
when that guy shoved you.

21:58.903 --> 22:06.632
And I know it doesn't make you mad that
you needed Clark Kent to save you again.

22:09.292 --> 22:12.283
Better.

22:28.631 --> 22:30.130
Andy.

22:30.130 --> 22:31.251
Whoa, whoa.

22:31.251 --> 22:34.292
Restraining order says you can't
come within 500 feet of me, Kent.

22:34.292 --> 22:35.804
I just want to talk.

22:35.804 --> 22:37.957
Anything you got to say,
you can say to my lawyer.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.839
- Well, let me apologize.
- It's too late!

22:40.839 --> 22:41.675
What?

22:41.675 --> 22:43.806
Look, we both made
mistakes the other night.

22:43.806 --> 22:47.013
And I understand that you're mad at me,
but this lawsuit could ruin my family.

22:47.013 --> 22:50.447
Just leave them out of it.

22:54.936 --> 22:56.855
I'll see you in court,

22:56.855 --> 23:03.126
and if you break this restraining order again,
I'll have the sheriff all over your ass!

23:13.233 --> 23:16.209
Man, don't hurt yourself.

23:38.946 --> 23:40.239
What's up?

23:40.239 --> 23:43.105
Andy Connors is faking his injuries.

23:43.105 --> 23:46.903
Well, that's an intriguing claim, but as the
defendant, I doubt your case holds much water.

23:46.903 --> 23:51.136
Well, I... I followed him home.
I saw him take his neck brace off.

23:51.136 --> 23:53.430
I was trying to gather some evidence
on him so I could nail him.

23:53.430 --> 23:55.479
Well, you know I'm always
up for a good conspiracy.

23:55.479 --> 23:57.230
Thanks, Chloe.

23:57.230 --> 24:03.587
Or if all else fails, we could send Lana
out to beat the confession out of him.

24:04.758 --> 24:07.172
It was a joke, Clark.

24:07.172 --> 24:11.474
Why do I get the feeling that you're not impressed
with Lana turning all Charlie's Angels on us?

24:11.474 --> 24:14.313
I know Lex's intentions are good.

24:14.313 --> 24:18.581
But what if she gets overconfident and finds
herself in a situation she can't handle?

24:18.581 --> 24:19.683
Clark,

24:19.683 --> 24:22.878
as a 6-foot-whatever guy,

24:22.878 --> 24:27.385
you have no idea what it feels like to have to cross the
street at night when you hear footsteps behind you.

24:27.385 --> 24:33.792
If getting a little girl power makes Lana feel like
less of a victim, then you should be all for it.

24:33.792 --> 24:35.526
I guess.

24:35.526 --> 24:38.773
Or is it that you're secretly worried that
if Lana learns to defend herself,

24:38.773 --> 24:43.868
she won't need a knight in shining
armor to rescue her anymore?

25:23.196 --> 25:25.905
Doctor?

25:29.194 --> 25:30.729
Paul.

25:30.729 --> 25:32.832
What are you doing here?

25:33.923 --> 25:36.396
I had to see you alone.

25:36.396 --> 25:40.172
All right, well, why don't we go upstairs
and we can talk about it over coffee?

25:40.172 --> 25:44.832
No, we can't go and have coffee,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

25:44.832 --> 25:48.632
When you broke up with me,
I thought that it was because

25:48.632 --> 25:51.259
you knew I was never
gonna be a great doctor.

25:51.259 --> 25:54.070
You were right.
That's why I quit.

25:54.070 --> 25:59.001
If you can't be great, why bother at all?
That's what you always used to say, right?

25:59.210 --> 26:00.023
Paul...

26:00.023 --> 26:03.346
I was working on becoming successful

26:03.346 --> 26:06.433
so that I could have you back!

26:06.433 --> 26:09.803
Then I found out that you were with Luthor

26:09.803 --> 26:13.855
and I knew that I had
to save you from that fraud.

26:13.855 --> 26:16.956
I don't want you to save me.

26:16.956 --> 26:20.062
Look, I broke up with you because
you beat your ex-girlfriend.

26:20.062 --> 26:24.006
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
She was so beneath me.

26:24.006 --> 26:29.907
That's not the case with you and I.
You and I were meant for each other.

26:30.152 --> 26:33.194
I love Lex.

26:33.194 --> 26:35.061
No.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.889
You don't.

26:37.801 --> 26:41.394
You love me.
You just don't know it yet.

26:41.394 --> 26:44.589
Get away from me, Paul!

26:50.376 --> 26:51.504
Hello?

26:51.504 --> 26:53.335
Helen, it's me.

26:53.335 --> 26:56.184
Look, you're right, I've
been distant the last few weeks,

26:56.184 --> 26:58.771
but that's gonna change.

26:58.771 --> 27:02.001
I'm on my way over so we can talk.

27:03.043 --> 27:04.115
Helen?

27:04.115 --> 27:06.996
I'm busy with a patient...

27:06.996 --> 27:10.883
in the pathology lab.

27:10.883 --> 27:12.584
- Helen?
- That was him, wasn't it?

27:12.584 --> 27:14.702
It was him. Wasn't it?!

27:14.702 --> 27:19.420
He doesn't love you!
Can't you see that?

27:19.713 --> 27:22.883
Helen, what's going on?

27:27.282 --> 27:29.584
Get up here.
Get up here, come on!

27:29.584 --> 27:32.384
Helen?!

27:32.895 --> 27:37.092
Paul, no! No! Aah!

27:48.752 --> 27:49.956
Helen!

27:50.622 --> 27:51.900
Helen!

27:52.460 --> 27:54.093
Helen!

28:00.320 --> 28:02.450
Helen!

28:08.270 --> 28:14.947
Get her to ER!
I need to 2 cc EPI and an IV push. Stat!

28:15.239 --> 28:17.692
Stat!

28:17.692 --> 28:20.869
Helen, Helen.

28:27.443 --> 28:29.947
Smallville is officially litter free.

28:29.947 --> 28:31.672
You must be exhausted.

28:31.672 --> 28:33.893
Well, frustrated and humiliated, yes.

28:33.893 --> 28:36.241
Exhausted, no.

28:36.241 --> 28:38.955
Hey, I can stick around
for a little while if you want.

28:38.955 --> 28:40.487
I'm fine, Clark.

28:40.487 --> 28:44.240
I know. I just thought you
might want some company.

28:45.660 --> 28:47.642
Karate class?

28:47.642 --> 28:49.750
I take it the meeting
with Lex went well.

28:49.750 --> 28:54.882
Lex has a way of bringing out a side of me that's
both scary and liberating at the same time.

28:54.882 --> 28:58.048
Well, you know the first rule of
self defense is to avoid conflict.

28:58.048 --> 29:02.083
Relax, Clark, I'm not about to go
prowling the night fighting crime.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.916
I'll leave that to the expert.

29:03.916 --> 29:10.482
Well, you can trust me, there's no future in
fighting crime unless you enjoy being sued.

29:11.473 --> 29:13.271
You know what the worst part is?

29:13.271 --> 29:16.055
I know that he's faking.
I just don't have proof.

29:16.055 --> 29:19.423
I was gonna follow him with a camera,
but I'd be violating the restraining order.

29:19.423 --> 29:22.192
Well, what about me?

29:22.192 --> 29:23.765
What about you?

29:23.765 --> 29:26.901
I want to see him go down as
badly as you do. Let me help.

29:26.901 --> 29:29.090
No, that'd be too dangerous.

29:29.090 --> 29:33.975
Clark, the law's not on our side.
What's are we supposed to do?

29:42.381 --> 29:45.356
Meacham, where the hell are you?
I need to know where Hayden is now!

29:45.356 --> 29:47.363
Mr. Luthor?

29:47.363 --> 29:50.515
I am sorry about Dr. Bryce,

29:50.515 --> 29:54.142
but I hope you are not planning
to take the law into your own hands.

29:54.142 --> 29:57.487
The woman I love is fighting
for her life, Sheriff, so

29:57.487 --> 30:00.734
you'll have to forgive my lack
of faith in Smallville's finest.

30:00.734 --> 30:03.614
I have roadblocks up
across every major highway.

30:03.614 --> 30:05.835
I have deputies canvassing the area,

30:05.835 --> 30:08.231
and I am waiting for a warrant
on his motel room.

30:08.231 --> 30:09.518
How long will that take?

30:09.518 --> 30:13.731
It will take a little while, but I have rung
every judge's bell in Lowell County.

30:13.731 --> 30:17.008
Well, I'm certainly glad you're
doing everything humanly possible.

30:17.008 --> 30:19.442
Mr. Luthor, where are you going?

30:19.442 --> 30:21.582
If I find you have tampered
with this investigation--

30:21.582 --> 30:24.054
You'll what?!

30:24.054 --> 30:26.330
You'll arrest me and make
me pick up trash?

30:26.330 --> 30:30.223
You are not above the law, Mr. Luthor.

30:30.223 --> 30:33.321
Thank you for that bracing insight.

30:33.321 --> 30:36.354
Am I free to go now?

30:41.411 --> 30:44.109
Meacham!

30:50.787 --> 30:53.249
Lex?

30:55.804 --> 30:57.740
Sheriff, I heard about Dr. Bryce.
Is she okay?

30:57.740 --> 30:59.043
It's still touch and go.

30:59.043 --> 31:00.087
Was it Paul Hayden?

31:00.087 --> 31:06.055
Mr. Kent, do I have to remind you about
involving yourself in police business?

31:06.055 --> 31:08.911
Where do we stand on that warrant
for Hayden's room at the Heartland?

31:08.911 --> 31:11.862
Twenty minutes.
We have cars standing by.

31:46.904 --> 31:49.532
- Clark, how did you get--
- The same way you did.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.887
What are you doing here, Lex?

31:50.887 --> 31:52.801
Look, stay out of this.

31:52.801 --> 31:58.153
- I know you want to nail this guy.
- But what? I should leave it to the pros?

31:58.153 --> 32:00.255
Hayden's car is still here, okay?

32:00.255 --> 32:04.719
I had a guy on him.
Now he's no--

32:41.707 --> 32:45.462
Son of a bitch,
he's got Meacham's car.

32:46.012 --> 32:48.938
Lex, we got company.

33:15.329 --> 33:17.525
Lojack system said the car was here.

33:17.525 --> 33:21.139
I thought only the police
had access to Lojack.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.951
- Let's split up.
- No, I think we should wait for Sheriff Adams.

33:25.951 --> 33:29.292
You wait. I'm gonna go look around.

34:09.254 --> 34:13.853
If you pull that trigger, you're going
to be the one going to prison.

34:20.934 --> 34:25.178
Not if it's self defense.

34:35.675 --> 34:38.168
I guess I forgot to load it.

34:38.168 --> 34:41.614
You're just full of surprises
today, aren't you?

37:18.669 --> 37:21.326
Goodbye, Paul.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.611
Lex!

37:37.874 --> 37:40.472
Hands up!

37:40.935 --> 37:45.212
Get rid of that gun, and put
that gun on the table right now.

37:45.212 --> 37:48.542
Put it on the table now!

37:55.255 --> 38:01.452
Last time I checked, citizen's
arrests are still legal in Kansas.

38:03.112 --> 38:06.014
Oh, man.

38:06.014 --> 38:09.241
I'm telling you,

38:09.241 --> 38:15.657
if I catch you meddling in a police
investigation again, I swear...

38:15.897 --> 38:19.446
heaven help you.

38:36.412 --> 38:38.251
Thanks for coming.

38:38.251 --> 38:42.814
Well, this better be good to
get me out of bed so early.

38:42.814 --> 38:45.720
Listen, Andy, um,

38:45.720 --> 38:49.153
I'm really sorry about what
happened the other night,

38:49.153 --> 38:53.471
but I think this has gotten a little
out of hand. The lawsuit?

38:53.471 --> 38:56.594
Don't worry about it.
It's Kent's problem.

38:56.594 --> 38:59.329
I know you're faking your injuries.

38:59.329 --> 39:04.012
I think you should drop
the suit before you get caught.

39:06.701 --> 39:12.311
You didn't call me here to
talk about no lawsuit, did you.

39:12.311 --> 39:13.801
Touch me again,

39:13.801 --> 39:17.469
and you'll have some
real soft-tissue injury.

39:17.469 --> 39:19.711
You can play hard to get,

39:19.711 --> 39:22.712
but we both know you want me.

39:22.712 --> 39:25.233
So why don't we take
this into the back.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.743
Hi, Clark.

39:54.743 --> 40:00.217
I just got a phone call saying
that Andy dropped the lawsuit.

40:00.217 --> 40:03.433
Any idea what could've
made him do that?

40:03.433 --> 40:09.115
Maybe he just realized that
you were trying to help a friend.

40:10.587 --> 40:14.113
The sheriff told me
you have quite a spin kick.

40:14.113 --> 40:16.393
I'm sorry I missed it.

40:16.898 --> 40:19.896
So you heard about that.

40:20.149 --> 40:23.137
- Lana...
- Clark, I know what you're gonna say.

40:23.137 --> 40:25.285
I shouldn't have gotten involved, but--

40:25.285 --> 40:28.633
I just wanted to say thank you.

40:32.245 --> 40:39.553
Well, you've been there for me so
many times. I wanted to repay you.

40:42.259 --> 40:43.539
Besides,

40:43.539 --> 40:49.926
it's not every day that Lana Lang
gets a chance to save Clark Kent.

40:53.044 --> 40:55.136
Yeah.

41:08.353 --> 41:11.347
I thought you had a board meeting.

41:11.347 --> 41:15.065
I canceled it for personal reasons.

41:15.693 --> 41:18.452
That's a first.

41:24.977 --> 41:29.281
My lawyer told me that Paul
is pleading temporary insanity.

41:29.281 --> 41:33.340
- Lex, I don't want--
- I told him not to fight the plea.

41:34.670 --> 41:36.869
Paul needs help.

41:42.774 --> 41:45.993
I wanted to kill him, Helen.

41:46.312 --> 41:50.125
I wanted to kill him for what he did to you.

41:50.125 --> 41:55.323
I probably could've gotten
away with it in everyone's eyes,

41:55.323 --> 41:58.060
but one person would've known the truth.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.022
Clark?

42:00.022 --> 42:03.115
You.

42:04.140 --> 42:07.833
Clark didn't save me
in that moment, Helen.

42:07.833 --> 42:10.692
You did.

42:13.268 --> 42:16.887
And that's when I knew.

42:32.590 --> 42:36.530
So what do you say, Dr. Bryce?

42:37.043 --> 42:40.356
Will you marry me?

42:41.305 --> 42:47.683
