00:36.574 --> 00:40.411
When do the
sins of a good man

00:40.446 --> 00:41.577
make him bad?

00:44.351 --> 00:47.253
I guess it all
comes down to choices.

00:50.819 --> 00:54.491
They say justice
doesn't come easy...

00:57.892 --> 00:59.826
...in an unjust world.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.800
Sometimes...

01:06.835 --> 01:10.606
If you're lucky...

01:10.641 --> 01:12.476
evil can be destroyed.

01:16.185 --> 01:17.646
But sometimes...

01:21.883 --> 01:24.554
Maybe it's better
to keep evil alive.

we take it down a few miles,

06:08.576 --> 06:09.806
Those aren't zombies.

06:09.841 --> 06:11.137
Ah!

06:38.166 --> 06:43.202
The breach, the chasm...

06:43.237 --> 06:46.876
Between you and nothingness.

06:46.911 --> 06:49.681
I can feel you when I breathe.

06:49.716 --> 06:51.617

You're lost.

06:59.924 --> 07:03.794
I'm beaten. Broken.

07:04.962 --> 07:08.766
And scarred, a lost limb.

07:08.801 --> 07:11.769
It will never come back.

07:11.804 --> 07:14.673
It will always feel attached...

08:05.352 --> 08:07.154
I have... I have a memory.

08:09.224 --> 08:10.729
It haunts me a little bit.

08:12.799 --> 08:14.535
I was ten years old and...

08:17.067 --> 08:19.166
My mom, she was still alive
at that time.

08:22.611 --> 08:23.874
I think she was upstairs.

08:25.944 --> 08:29.880
But when I came home
and opened the door,

08:29.915 --> 08:34.016
a small red sparrow
flew through and...

09:00.341 --> 09:01.780
But it just...

09:03.850 --> 09:06.246
It just kept flying
into the window until it, um...

09:09.955 --> 09:11.185
Until it just broke its neck.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.794
You're not a sparrow, Sarah.

09:15.829 --> 09:17.994
You can see the open door.

09:42.284 --> 09:44.317
Oh, Beth, can you imagine
what it's like to have a dad

09:44.352 --> 09:45.725
who lets you actually do things?

09:45.760 --> 09:47.760
Crazy thought.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.223
Like, how could
you want to miss out

09:49.258 --> 09:51.357
on my world
famous potato skins anyway?

09:51.392 --> 09:53.161
-It's just one dinner.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:53.196 --> 09:55.031
It's not just one dinner, honey.

09:55.066 --> 09:57.836
It's the traditional Bishop
family Christmas Eve dinner.

09:57.871 --> 09:59.167
Can we got the stuffy now?

09:59.202 --> 10:01.807
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go grab it, honey.

10:01.842 --> 10:04.073
-Dad?
-Yes.

10:04.108 --> 10:07.747
Do you realize that
I'm the only senior with no car,

10:07.782 --> 10:11.443
no boyfriend,
and a- 00 curfew?

10:11.478 --> 10:13.412
Sounds like you got
one smart dad.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.952
Ha ha ha ha.

10:14.987 --> 10:16.448
Dad, it's not funny.
I'm serious.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.757
Why can't I just go?

10:17.792 --> 10:18.824
What happened to our deal, huh?

10:18.859 --> 10:20.386
What deal?

10:20.421 --> 10:22.223
That you weren't going
to get all grown up on me

10:22.258 --> 10:24.995
without my permission.

10:25.030 --> 10:26.194
Whatever, thank you.

10:28.363 --> 10:31.870
Hey. Wow. That's so cool, honey.
Little guy's going to love that.

10:31.905 --> 10:34.004
Let's pick out some cool
wrapping paper, too, huh?

10:34.039 --> 10:36.039
Can't we just give it
to them like this?

10:36.074 --> 10:39.174
A present is not a present
until it's wrapped.

10:39.209 --> 10:40.208
You can't just take it.

10:40.243 --> 10:41.946
It's over here.

10:41.981 --> 10:43.882
That's our tree. You can't just
take our tree.

10:43.917 --> 10:45.213
What's your problem, dude?

10:45.248 --> 10:48.315
Hey. What's going on, honey?

10:48.350 --> 10:50.757
I was just standing on my phone,
and that guy, he just dragged

10:50.792 --> 10:51.989
the tree away from me
like it was his.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.390
-Okay.
-Excuse me, sir.

10:57.425 --> 10:58.996
You made a mistake.
That's our tree.

11:02.001 --> 11:03.363
Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.

11:03.398 --> 11:06.971
Hey, is your name on the tag,
or does it say

11:07.006 --> 11:09.141
I'm for sale for 50 bucks?

11:12.209 --> 11:13.747
Hey, pal, look.

11:13.782 --> 11:14.880
I'm not your pal.

11:28.258 --> 11:30.929
19, 20.

11:30.964 --> 11:32.832
Daddy's tougher than the Hulk!

11:32.867 --> 11:34.966
Keep counting, you.

11:35.001 --> 11:36.968
You mean the same tough guy
who's wanted a motorcycle

11:37.003 --> 11:39.971
his entire life but wimps out
every time he goes to get one?

11:42.107 --> 11:47.110
What you call being a wimp,
I call being practical.

11:47.145 --> 11:50.146
Just like how we practically got
the Christmas tree we wanted.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.986
You won't become a teenager,
right, Freckles?

11:55.021 --> 11:56.757
Absolutely not.

12:16.977 --> 12:18.273
-Hey, you.
-Hi.

12:18.308 --> 12:20.440
So, uh...

12:20.475 --> 12:22.145
Still upset
about this morning?

12:22.180 --> 12:24.884
Mmm... I mean, I just don't
understand, like,

12:24.919 --> 12:26.281
why do you do all those
push ups and stuff

12:26.316 --> 12:28.019
if you can't even
defend your daughters?

12:28.054 --> 12:29.383
So you think I should
have just punched the guy out

12:29.418 --> 12:31.088
in the middle of
the Christmas tree lot?

12:31.123 --> 12:33.090
Oh, my God.
That is not what I just said.

12:33.125 --> 12:34.586
I'm just saying, Dad.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.391
You watch<i> Die Hard,</i>
what, every day?

12:37.426 --> 12:41.131
What do you think, Bruce...
whatever his name is, would do?

12:41.166 --> 12:43.529
'80s action heroes,
they solve problems

12:43.564 --> 12:46.136
with violence and one liners.

12:46.171 --> 12:47.907
You know, real life
doesn't work that way.

12:47.942 --> 12:49.568
Got it. Noted.

12:49.603 --> 12:53.077
I'm thinking I may actually
address it in my sermon tonight.

12:53.112 --> 12:54.881
Dad, no.
Daddy, please.

12:54.916 --> 12:56.410
No, you can not talk
about me in your sermon.

12:56.445 --> 12:59.248
I forgot to tell you,
you can go to the party tonight.

12:59.283 --> 13:01.415
Oh my God, really?

13:01.450 --> 13:02.548
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.517
If you're home by- 30.

13:04.552 --> 13:06.387
Okay? Yeah,- 30.
No problem.

13:06.422 --> 13:08.125
All right? You're not back
by the time Santa shows up,

13:08.160 --> 13:09.390
no presents for you.

13:09.425 --> 13:11.425
Okay.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.624
-- 30.
-Yes.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.296
I'll be here.

13:47.232 --> 13:51.003
Before we wrap up this service,

13:51.038 --> 13:53.302
I'd like to share
a personal story

13:53.337 --> 13:55.073
that happened yesterday.

13:55.108 --> 13:58.208
My girls and I, we were out
shopping for our tree.

14:00.641 --> 14:03.246
Picking up a few presents.

14:03.281 --> 14:06.480
Nothing like last minute, right?

14:06.515 --> 14:11.056
I leave Sarah
in line to pay for the tree

14:11.091 --> 14:13.652
while Rebecca and I go pick up
a few more gifts.

14:13.687 --> 14:17.293
We look back

14:17.328 --> 14:20.395
and we see a man

14:20.430 --> 14:23.266
has claimed our tree as his.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.567
I tried talking to him.

14:27.602 --> 14:29.140
Hey, pal, look...

14:29.175 --> 14:30.273
I'm not your pal.

14:37.249 --> 14:39.150
Sarah's eyes say to me,

14:39.185 --> 14:43.484
"Dad, aren't you
going to do something?"

14:45.521 --> 14:47.719
So I did.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.193
I did do something.

14:53.661 --> 14:55.001
Merry Christmas.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.239
I know, I know.

15:02.274 --> 15:05.011
Not exactly a one liner
worthy of Rambo

15:05.046 --> 15:07.706
or the Terminator.

15:09.314 --> 15:10.643
Should I have knocked
him on his butt

15:10.678 --> 15:12.243
in the middle
of the Christmas tree lot?

15:15.320 --> 15:17.617
Luke 18, verse three.

15:17.652 --> 15:21.489
Here is a parable
about a woman

15:21.524 --> 15:24.591
seeking vengeance
for a wrongdoer

15:24.626 --> 15:29.332
who victimized her
and then escaped justice.

15:29.367 --> 15:33.039
"Avenge me of mine adversary."

15:33.074 --> 15:36.504
Day and night,
she begs this judge.

15:36.539 --> 15:38.110
But Jesus tells us...

15:39.575 --> 15:43.016
"When a sinner goes unpunished,

15:43.051 --> 15:47.020
"he is only free
from man's law.

15:51.455 --> 15:53.719
"When man's law fails...

15:55.690 --> 15:57.294
God's law prevails."

16:02.367 --> 16:06.204
So I leave
you all with one last word

16:06.239 --> 16:10.373
to any of us seeking
justice in a world

16:10.408 --> 16:11.440
where it's lacking.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.578
Trust not in the sword,

16:17.613 --> 16:19.745
but in the grace of our Lord.

16:41.505 --> 16:42.669
Anybody here?

16:48.677 --> 16:49.643
Yo.

16:53.319 --> 16:54.384
You here?

16:56.652 --> 16:57.651
Hello?

17:06.167 --> 17:07.397
Hello?

17:12.569 --> 17:14.107
Yo, hey, man.

17:18.212 --> 17:19.541
Yo. You in there?

17:19.576 --> 17:20.740
Yo!

17:36.758 --> 17:37.823
Don't touch my car.

17:40.564 --> 17:43.301
Fuck. Trying to give me
a heart attack?

17:47.439 --> 17:49.505
You want to fucking go
right now, motherfucker?

17:49.540 --> 17:51.111
Let's go.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.546
I was just fucking
with you, man.

17:57.581 --> 17:59.713
I'm glad we're doing this.

17:59.748 --> 18:01.319
But, hey, I get it.

18:01.354 --> 18:03.156
You're a,
"You can fuck my old lady,

18:03.191 --> 18:05.653
but stay the fuck away
from my wheels" kind of guy.

18:05.688 --> 18:07.688
I can dig it.

18:07.723 --> 18:09.789
Sorry I'm late.

18:09.824 --> 18:12.198
Break number seven.
You believe that?

18:13.927 --> 18:16.301
Boom, ah!

18:16.336 --> 18:20.437
The bitch is I keep re-breaking
the fucker over and over.

18:25.411 --> 18:26.344
Yeah.

18:29.382 --> 18:32.944
All right, well, let's do this.

18:32.979 --> 18:36.519
Hey, man, if you had told me
that one day

18:36.554 --> 18:39.687
our clubs would have been
doing business together,

18:39.722 --> 18:41.491
I'd have never fucking
believed it.

18:46.267 --> 18:48.300
Look at this shit, man.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.864

ass cheeks.

18:51.899 --> 18:52.931
Mmm.

18:55.408 --> 18:59.773
Oh, hey,
you're Vic's brother, right?

18:59.808 --> 19:01.808
Oh, yeah, man.

19:01.843 --> 19:03.678
I've heard stories, man.

19:03.713 --> 19:05.779
You are one crazy fuck!

19:07.717 --> 19:09.189
Whew!

19:13.657 --> 19:15.426
You brought money, right?

19:25.834 --> 19:26.767
Here you go, kid.

19:39.584 --> 19:41.749
Hey, if I didn't have
a busted ham hock,

19:41.784 --> 19:43.685

The space in my soul, stolen.

Spiritual death is nothing else

-Otto...
-Shh.

"Therefore put on the
full armor of God,

"So when the day of evil comes

1:28:22.032 --> 1:28:23.900
"you will be able
