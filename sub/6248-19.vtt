00:14.200 --> 00:15.400
Can you make anything out?

00:15.600 --> 00:16.400
Yes

00:17.500 --> 00:18.700
It's a crater

00:18.800 --> 00:20.400
We know it's a crater, Bones

00:20.400 --> 00:22.000
The question is, what caused it?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.400
You should ask
a geologist

00:23.500 --> 00:25.500
I can tell you for sure
it's not a meteor

00:25.500 --> 00:26.700
You get a look what's inside?

00:26.800 --> 00:30.000
Not for long. State Troopers
didn't want anyone getting near it
until you people got here

00:30.100 --> 00:31.200
That's very nice of them

00:31.200 --> 00:32.500
But what did it look like?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.600
I'm pretty sure it was meat

00:36.700 --> 00:38.200
Meat wearing clothes

00:39.600 --> 00:40.700
What do you want to do?

00:41.100 --> 00:42.800
Let's take a look

00:52.600 --> 00:54.000
So what do you think?
Dead?

00:54.900 --> 00:58.300
Just saying
if he fell out of a plane that
plane is long gone by now

00:58.400 --> 01:00.100
No sign of a parachute

01:00.100 --> 01:01.900
What do those shoes
look like to you?

01:02.100 --> 01:02.900
Loafers

01:02.900 --> 01:05.800
He hit the ground
at approximately 200
kilometers per hour

01:06.100 --> 01:07.800
How can you tell that
by his shoes?

01:07.900 --> 01:11.600
124 miles per hour
is terminal velocity
for a falling human

01:11.600 --> 01:13.800
So we're going to go
with the theory that this
was once human?

01:13.800 --> 01:17.000
I've never read about
an alien encounter in which
the aliens wore loafers

01:17.100 --> 01:18.900
How much you want to bet
Hodgins has?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.600
The crows and critters
sure made quick work of him

01:25.700 --> 01:29.600
Yeah, But these
Calliphora vicina eggs
will confirm time of landing

01:29.800 --> 01:31.900
Blowflies on aliens
Who knew?

01:32.200 --> 01:33.300
You're taking
a shot at me

01:33.300 --> 01:35.900
because I happen to believe
that we are not all alone

01:36.000 --> 01:37.600
and in an infinity
of space?

01:37.700 --> 01:38.900
It's not the believing

01:39.000 --> 01:40.900
in extraterrestrial life
that's odd

01:41.000 --> 01:42.700
It's the believing
that they're visiting us

01:43.000 --> 01:46.300
This guy is wearing loafers
Aliens don't wear loafers, people

01:46.500 --> 01:48.700
Even if they want
to pass unnoticed amongst us?

01:48.800 --> 01:50.200
no before taking us over?

01:50.300 --> 01:52.900
Oh. Oh, this is harassment

01:53.000 --> 01:55.800
You know, it's illegal
to mock people for
their fundamental beliefs

01:56.800 --> 01:58.700
Is the tissue damage
consistent with a long fall?

01:58.800 --> 02:00.100
Definitely

02:00.200 --> 02:01.800
You've seen something
like this before?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.600
Suicide off the Chrysler Building

02:03.700 --> 02:04.800
At least this one
didn't hit pavement

02:05.200 --> 02:09.199
A human being reaches
terminal velocity after falling
200 to 220 meters

02:09.500 --> 02:11.300
depending upon
air resistance

02:11.400 --> 02:13.900
Velocity would be achieved
between five and eight seconds

02:14.200 --> 02:16.000
depending upon
atmospheric conditions

02:16.000 --> 02:17.900
body position
and clothing

02:17.900 --> 02:20.900
He fell from a minimum
of 1,200 feet

02:20.900 --> 02:22.500
I can run through the math
if you'd like

02:22.600 --> 02:24.400
- Send me an e-mail
- This is

02:24.700 --> 02:28.100
I want to say anomalous
but I'm going to go with weird

02:28.200 --> 02:31.900
- What's weird?
- These areas of radiolucency
here and here

02:31.900 --> 02:34.100
- Extremely porous bones
- What's that mean?

02:34.200 --> 02:35.300
That means he was ill

02:35.400 --> 02:39.400
His right, femoral head shows
significant demineralization

02:40.000 --> 02:43.200
- Zack?
- I'd put him at 130

02:43.900 --> 02:44.800
130 what?

02:44.800 --> 02:47.000
- Years
- Old?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
There's an alternate
explanation

02:49.500 --> 02:51.300
Then that's the one
we should go with

02:52.100 --> 02:53.300
He was in outer space

02:53.600 --> 02:57.300
So he fell from outer space
in a pair of loafers

02:59.400 --> 03:01.100
Hodgins left too soon

03:06.400 --> 03:08.800
Bones 219

03:09.000 --> 03:15.400
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

03:25.700 --> 03:28.300
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM@mzinfo</font>

03:35.900 --> 03:37.900
The FAA reports
no recent accidents

03:38.000 --> 03:40.700
involving anyone falling
from a plane, balloon or blimp

03:40.700 --> 03:42.000
commercial or otherwise

03:42.100 --> 03:46.000
The FAA doesn't have
jurisdiction over the entire
universe my friend

03:46.300 --> 03:47.600
Little green men?

03:48.400 --> 03:51.500
Gray, They're gray
Not green, Gray

03:52.000 --> 03:54.200
Being as you're
half alien yourself
you should know that

03:54.400 --> 03:56.700
If they dropped him from orbit
he'd have burned up

03:56.800 --> 03:58.700
and his loafers
would have fallen off

03:59.000 --> 04:00.300
If he wasn't
an abductee

04:00.400 --> 04:02.600
tossed out of an
interplanetary spacecraft

04:02.700 --> 04:06.100
why do his bones show
that he has spent an extended
time in outer space?

04:07.100 --> 04:10.200
The only rational explanation
is that he was an astronaut

04:15.600 --> 04:17.800
Astronauts lose two percent
of their bone mass

04:17.899 --> 04:19.500
for each month
spent in space

04:19.500 --> 04:21.899
Our victim's legs
hips and lower vertebrae

04:21.899 --> 04:23.800
have demineralized
over 20%

04:23.900 --> 04:26.100
indicating
ten months in space

04:26.200 --> 04:27.100
Do we do that?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.900
The longest shuttle
flight was STS-80

04:30.000 --> 04:32.400
17.66 days, in 1996

04:32.500 --> 04:33.500
The longest we know of

04:33.600 --> 04:35.000
The man who's spent
the most time in space

04:35.100 --> 04:36.500
was a Russian cosmonaut

04:36.500 --> 04:37.400
That we know of

04:37.400 --> 04:38.600
Why do you know that?

04:39.100 --> 04:40.600
My knowledge is vast

04:41.100 --> 04:42.100
Why did I ask?

04:42.100 --> 04:44.900
Anyway, there can't
be all that many people

04:45.000 --> 04:46.200
who have accumulated
ten months in space

04:46.500 --> 04:47.400
That we know of

04:49.100 --> 04:52.200
Call Booth
Tell him to see if anyone's
missing an astronaut

04:54.100 --> 04:55.600
Meet Colonel Calvin Howard

04:55.700 --> 04:58.600
Senior Training Specialist
and Crew Liaison
in the shuttle program

04:58.600 --> 05:00.900
currently working in
the National Space Agency

05:01.300 --> 05:02.700
in Bristol, Maryland

05:02.800 --> 05:06.800
Angela just sent me her
work in progress off the partial
skull reconstruction

05:06.900 --> 05:09.100
She says we expected
too much too soon

05:09.100 --> 05:12.300
but the shape of the head
the cheekbones...

05:13.100 --> 05:14.200
Close enough for jazz

05:14.900 --> 05:17.600
Oh. Six months in
the International Space Station

05:17.600 --> 05:19.100
plus a number
of servicing missions

05:19.200 --> 05:21.200
to both the Hubble
and Lansing telescopes

05:21.300 --> 05:24.100
Wait. Does that add up to
the right amount of bone rot?

05:24.200 --> 05:27.900
Loss.Bone loss
And... yes

05:28.100 --> 05:29.500
Has anyone
reported him missing?

05:29.600 --> 05:30.900
No. Not exactly

05:31.300 --> 05:32.200
Not exactly?

05:32.200 --> 05:35.100
We know astronauts
are regarded as
viable terror targets

05:35.400 --> 05:37.200
Their whereabouts?
Extremely confidential

05:37.300 --> 05:38.900
Bet if you told the Agency
you were going

05:38.900 --> 05:40.600
to identify Colonel Howard
to the press

05:40.700 --> 05:42.100
they would be
a little more cooperative

05:42.200 --> 05:44.400
Yeah. You know, I have been
a wonderful influence on you

05:44.500 --> 05:46.200
Actually
I learned that move from Cam

05:46.300 --> 05:47.600
Yeah, well, I went
the other way with it, okay?

05:47.700 --> 05:50.200
Looked up his wife
in the phone book

05:55.000 --> 05:57.300
Did my husband die in some kind
of training accident?

05:57.500 --> 05:59.300
We don't believe so
ma'am. No

05:59.400 --> 06:00.500
It couldn't have been

06:00.500 --> 06:01.500
How do you know that?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.600
Because the Space Agency
would be all over this

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
You're probably right

06:04.900 --> 06:07.400
They wouldn't let anybody
else take the lead
not even us

06:08.300 --> 06:10.800
You say your husband left
the day before yesterday?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.100
On what airline?

06:12.200 --> 06:13.400
Cal flies himself

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
What kind of plane?

06:14.600 --> 06:17.700
He has a turboprop Cessna
out at McNichol

06:18.100 --> 06:21.500
What exactly does a
Senior Training Specialist

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
and Crew Liaison do?

06:23.700 --> 06:25.500
We're not supposed
to discuss these things

06:25.700 --> 06:28.100
For the past three years
Cal's been training others to go up

06:28.200 --> 06:30.000
Because he lost
his medical clearance?

06:31.300 --> 06:32.100
How did you know that?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.100
His X-rays show
that he was suffering from

06:34.200 --> 06:36.200
a dramatic loss
of bone density

06:36.300 --> 06:38.000
Must have been hard
on the colonel

06:38.800 --> 06:41.100
training others to do
what he'd love to do

06:41.200 --> 06:44.000
No, Cal was a team player

06:44.200 --> 06:46.900
He was training her husband
James for almost a year

06:47.400 --> 06:49.300
Actually
it was very hard on him

06:49.400 --> 06:50.500
It would be hard on any of them

06:50.600 --> 06:53.200
All they ever do is think
about going back into space

06:54.300 --> 06:55.900
and all we ever
think about

06:56.100 --> 06:57.400
is getting them
back home

06:57.600 --> 06:58.700
Is there some
kind of rule

06:58.700 --> 07:00.700
that astronaut's wives
travel in packs?

07:00.700 --> 07:03.300
When you marry an astronaut
no one really understands, except...

07:03.400 --> 07:06.100
Except other people
who are in the same situation

07:07.000 --> 07:08.300
This is Cal's itinerary

07:09.300 --> 07:11.500
Mainly when he intended
to call me and...

07:15.000 --> 07:16.300
when he'd be back

07:16.600 --> 07:18.800
You expected your husband
home today?

07:19.900 --> 07:21.100
Yeah

07:31.400 --> 07:33.200
Yeah. I just need to know
if it's still in the hangar or not

07:33.300 --> 07:35.400
It's a Cessna turboprop plane

07:35.400 --> 07:37.300
registered
to Colonel Calvin Howard

07:37.900 --> 07:38.800
Thanks

07:38.900 --> 07:42.500
It just seemed so odd
Those women
stick together like a harem

07:42.500 --> 07:44.000
What? They support
each other, you know?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.500
A lot of service
wives are like that

07:45.600 --> 07:47.400
What about astronauts' husbands?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.200
Look, their husbands
train for years, Bones

07:49.200 --> 07:51.300
Their families invest
their entire lives

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
Yeah

07:54.800 --> 07:56.200
Are you sure?

07:56.300 --> 07:57.600
Okay. Great. Thanks

07:57.700 --> 07:59.200
Well, plane's still
in the hangar

07:59.300 --> 08:01.200
Well, if that's the plane
he got tossed out of

08:01.300 --> 08:03.400
then it didn't fly itself back

08:06.100 --> 08:09.400
If someone simply pushed him
out of the plane

08:09.500 --> 08:10.900
there might not be any evidence

08:10.900 --> 08:14.300
We have to hope
there was a struggle

08:14.600 --> 08:15.500
Excuse me

08:16.000 --> 08:17.100
Could I see
some I.D., please?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.900
Yeah. Sure. I'll show you mine
if you show me yours

08:21.000 --> 08:22.500
Right. Here you go

08:23.100 --> 08:25.000
That airplane belongs
to the Agency

08:25.200 --> 08:28.200
Our information
is that it belongs
to Colonel Calvin Howard

08:28.300 --> 08:32.100
- The Agency leased it to him
- Well, it's being investigated
as a possible crime scene

08:32.200 --> 08:33.900
You're Colonel Howard's boss?

08:34.100 --> 08:35.600
Yes. Nina Sanborn

08:36.000 --> 08:38.200
I carry a rank equivalent
to an Air Force general

08:38.299 --> 08:41.700
Hmm. Why didn't you report him
missing, General Sanborn?

08:41.799 --> 08:43.200
Equivalent, I said

08:43.299 --> 08:44.400
I'm a civilian

08:44.500 --> 08:48.500
Cal was...
Colonel Howard wasn't missing

08:48.700 --> 08:49.800
He was barely
gone a day

08:50.100 --> 08:51.500
General Sanborn

08:51.600 --> 08:52.900
I know you people
are really tight-lipped

08:53.000 --> 08:56.700
but I'm really good friends
with a very aggressive
federal prosecutor who is great

08:56.800 --> 08:57.500
at getting warrants

08:58.200 --> 08:59.400
Agent Booth?

08:59.500 --> 09:02.100
We got the usual fibers
hair, particulates

09:02.200 --> 09:03.600
No blood?
No sign of a struggle?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.400
Nothing. You'll have my full
report by the end of the day

09:06.500 --> 09:09.300
Great. Okay, I need to know what
Colonel Howard was working on

09:09.300 --> 09:10.800
at the time of his death

09:11.300 --> 09:12.900
Get your warrant
Agent Booth

09:13.000 --> 09:14.500
Dr. Brennan

09:15.100 --> 09:18.400
Hey, excuse me, Equivalent-
to-a-General Sanborn

09:20.900 --> 09:22.200
I got that warrant

09:23.000 --> 09:24.400
Why didn't you just
tell her that right away?

09:24.500 --> 09:27.300
I was hoping
we could all be friends

09:27.500 --> 09:29.000
Let me see that

09:35.500 --> 09:37.300
These are the documents you
subpoenaed from the Agency?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.200
Yeah, but all the info
is blacked out

09:39.300 --> 09:40.400
Want me to see if
I can get anything out of this?

09:40.500 --> 09:41.200
Can you?

09:41.300 --> 09:43.100
No. I'd need originals

09:43.200 --> 09:44.700
These are photocopies

09:48.400 --> 09:49.800
Then why did you offer?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.300
Well, why else
would you ask me here?

09:51.400 --> 09:54.700
You're a conspiracy nut
and I thought you'd enjoy
filling in the blanks

09:54.700 --> 09:56.100
With paranoid ravings?

09:56.200 --> 09:57.100
Better than nothing

09:57.200 --> 09:58.600
Lansing Telescope

09:58.700 --> 10:00.700
- That mean anything to you?
- Yeah

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
A multi-gazillion-dollar
deep space, multifrequency

10:05.100 --> 10:07.500
telescope that keeps
needing repairs

10:07.600 --> 10:08.800
Why did you say it like that?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.400
It doesn't need repairs

10:12.300 --> 10:14.100
There's no rust in space

10:14.100 --> 10:18.100
The so-called "repair crews"
are up there retrieving
classified information

10:19.100 --> 10:20.700
What classified
information?

10:20.800 --> 10:24.700
The telescope is pointed
up at the planet Pluto

10:25.100 --> 10:26.500
Pluto's no longer a planet

10:26.600 --> 10:28.100
It was demoted

10:28.200 --> 10:29.700
And if the Lansing was
pointed away from the Earth

10:29.800 --> 10:31.700
why would they need
to black out all this material?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.900
Can I ask you a question?

10:35.700 --> 10:36.900
Yeah

10:38.100 --> 10:39.200
What's the deal on proposing

10:39.500 --> 10:40.600
to--- you know a woman?

10:41.100 --> 10:44.500
I mean, what is the
absolute proper way to do it?

10:44.600 --> 10:47.300
I don't know. The one time
I did it, I got shot down flat

10:47.400 --> 10:48.200
Did you do it by the book?

10:48.300 --> 10:50.600
Mm-hmm
No...

10:51.200 --> 10:53.600
We were waiting for
the stick to turn blue
or not to turn blue

10:53.700 --> 10:56.000
and I realized
I wanted to marry her if the

10:56.100 --> 10:58.200
stick was
blue or not

10:58.300 --> 11:00.400
Yeah, that's sort of what I did

11:00.500 --> 11:02.500
only without the sticks

11:02.900 --> 11:04.600
You asked Angela to marry you?

11:04.600 --> 11:05.700
Apparently I didn't do it right

11:06.000 --> 11:06.800
Do it again

11:06.900 --> 11:06.900
Go all out this time, right?

11:06.900 --> 11:12.600
With the dinner and the getting
down on one knee, the violin

11:13.500 --> 11:15.300
Forget the violin

11:17.700 --> 11:19.300
Hey, hey
with his bone density

11:20.100 --> 11:22.200
Colonel Howard sure as hell
wasn't going back into space again

11:22.300 --> 11:24.700
Yeah, I know, that's why he was
training his replacement

11:24.800 --> 11:26.100
His replacement? For what?

11:26.100 --> 11:28.400
To repair the Lansing Telescope

11:28.500 --> 11:31.500
Oh, brothers-in-arms
my brother

11:31.600 --> 11:33.500
That replacement's the guy
who can tell you things

11:33.600 --> 11:35.600
the Agency doesn't
want you to know

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
Ah

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200
Makes you feel small
doesn't it?

11:48.900 --> 11:50.000
Because the picture's so big?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.900
No, because the universe
is so big

11:52.000 --> 11:53.200
You're not looking
at the universe

11:53.200 --> 11:55.500
You're looking at
an enlarged photograph of Earth

11:55.500 --> 11:57.800
You see one thing
and I see another thing

11:57.900 --> 11:59.800
Personally, I like what I see

12:00.800 --> 12:02.800
Agent Booth
Dr. Brennan

12:02.900 --> 12:06.500
I'm afraid Commander Adams
is scheduled for time
on the A300 Zero-G

12:06.600 --> 12:07.800
You're welcome
to talk to him there

12:07.900 --> 12:09.200
The Zero-G?

12:09.300 --> 12:11.100
The Vomit Comet

12:13.900 --> 12:14.800
Makes no sense

12:14.900 --> 12:17.300
Man flies eight missions into space
and he falls out of a plane?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.500
I don't think so

12:18.800 --> 12:22.100
Look, you don't know anyone
who would want to throw
him out of a plane?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.400
Look, I don't mean
to tell you your work

12:25.500 --> 12:26.700
but shouldn't you
be tracking down

12:26.700 --> 12:29.100
everyone who flew over that
particular piece of real estate?

12:29.200 --> 12:31.600
We are, but not everyone
filed flight plans

12:31.700 --> 12:33.300
And not everyone
sticks to flight plans

12:33.400 --> 12:35.000
And you didn't
answer the question

12:35.100 --> 12:37.800
I don't know anyone who didn't
like and respect Cal Howard

12:38.100 --> 12:42.100
All these itineraries--
people keeping secrets
even from their spouses

12:42.400 --> 12:45.600
Look, sir, I understand you
have to ask questions like these

12:45.700 --> 12:48.000
but Cal Howard and Jean Marie
were a very solid couple

12:48.100 --> 12:49.500
Did you ever get drunk together?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.700
What?

12:50.700 --> 12:52.600
What my partner
is trying to ask

12:52.700 --> 12:54.300
is if you two were buddies

12:54.400 --> 12:56.100
Go out and
have drinks

12:56.200 --> 12:57.100
and exchange confidences?

12:57.200 --> 12:58.500
Yes, that's what I asked

12:58.500 --> 13:00.800
Yeah, sure
of course, at times

13:00.900 --> 13:03.100
So you would have known
if his marriage was in trouble?

13:03.400 --> 13:04.500
Yes, sir, I would

13:04.600 --> 13:05.700
How can you be sure?

13:08.900 --> 13:12.300
Because Cal knew when I was
unfaithful to my wife

13:12.500 --> 13:13.600
Colleen?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.300
Right. You guys met her
at Cal's place

13:16.500 --> 13:17.200
Look...

13:17.300 --> 13:18.700
that has to stay between us

13:19.800 --> 13:21.500
Strictly between us

13:21.500 --> 13:25.500
Cal Howard was my friend,
my colleague and my teacher

13:26.100 --> 13:28.500
If somebody tossed him
from an airplane

13:28.500 --> 13:30.100
I'll do whatever
I can to help

13:30.100 --> 13:32.900
Why do I get the feeling
you want to tell us something?

13:36.100 --> 13:38.200
Commander Adams
prepare to go weightless

13:39.100 --> 13:40.700
We're about to go weightless

13:41.000 --> 13:44.300
As the plane reaches the apogee
of a climb and then falls

13:44.600 --> 13:47.700
we will have 15 to 20 seconds
of weightlessness

14:30.000 --> 14:31.200
That was great

14:31.800 --> 14:33.500
Oh, man, you're not kidding

14:35.100 --> 14:37.900
I would like very much
to do that again

14:39.600 --> 14:41.400
I believe you were about
to tell us something

14:45.700 --> 14:48.000
Cal was talking to the STC

14:48.400 --> 14:49.100
The what?

14:49.100 --> 14:50.500
Space Travel Coalition

14:50.500 --> 14:53.400
It's a privately funded
space exploration
and tourism group

14:53.500 --> 14:54.300
And... did you?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.900
Did we what?
Did we what?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Vomit in the Comet?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.200
No, I didn't vomit

14:58.200 --> 14:59.600
I'm sure they were trying

14:59.900 --> 15:02.100
They can try me any time

15:02.100 --> 15:03.500
It was truly amazing

15:03.500 --> 15:04.700
She had a little bit
too much fun, okay?

15:04.700 --> 15:06.800
So what's with this
whole thing about
space tourism?

15:06.900 --> 15:08.600
Oh, celestial joy rides
for gazillionaires

15:08.900 --> 15:11.000
Selling seats on a spaceship
that don't even exist yet

15:11.100 --> 15:13.400
And won't be viable for
at least another few years

15:13.500 --> 15:14.400
That's what they want
you to think

15:14.500 --> 15:15.700
but these guys are
swimming in dough

15:15.800 --> 15:16.900
I already bought my ticket

15:16.900 --> 15:19.200
I want to see what's
going on up there
with my own eyes

15:22.700 --> 15:24.200
What?

15:29.300 --> 15:31.100
These are the
victim's clothes?

15:31.100 --> 15:32.700
Yes

15:32.800 --> 15:34.500
You'd like me to do
what with them?

15:34.600 --> 15:38.600
Construct a three-dimensional
hypothesis of what caused
this damage to the clothing

15:38.900 --> 15:40.500
Falling from an
airplane isn't enough?

15:40.600 --> 15:43.800
That would explain the burst
seams and pressure tears

15:43.900 --> 15:45.600
but this seems to be...

15:46.600 --> 15:47.800
Slashes

15:47.900 --> 15:49.000
yeah, When Zack gets ahold
of the bones

15:49.000 --> 15:52.200
maybe you two can figure out
if something catastrophic
happened to this man

15:52.300 --> 15:54.000
You mean before
he fell to Earth?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.400
Yes

15:55.800 --> 15:56.900
Go do your magic

15:58.800 --> 16:00.200
Now?

16:00.200 --> 16:03.300
Are you certain you can't
do what needs to be done
with X-rays alone?

16:03.400 --> 16:06.200
Do you need continued access
to the soft tissue?

16:06.200 --> 16:09.200
Why would the body burst
vertically when all the forces
are horizontal?

16:09.300 --> 16:11.900
Ah, so you need more time with
the soft tissue to answer that?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.300
Not really

16:13.600 --> 16:17.100
Please explain to me
your reluctance to remove
the flesh from the bones

16:17.200 --> 16:19.800
I'm all right with it, Zack
if it's absolutely necessary

16:19.900 --> 16:21.800
even the boiling part...

16:22.200 --> 16:24.200
but perhaps you could at least
acknowledge

16:24.300 --> 16:25.200
that this is a person

16:25.300 --> 16:26.600
Was, you mean

16:26.600 --> 16:28.300
Was someone's husband, Zack

16:28.400 --> 16:31.900
What does that have
to do with removing the flesh
from his bones?

16:33.900 --> 16:35.500
Fine. Do what you have to do

16:35.600 --> 16:36.700
Thank you

16:38.300 --> 16:39.400
Igor

16:40.700 --> 16:42.800
I beg your pardon
Dr. Saroyan?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.300
Nothing

16:48.600 --> 16:50.700
Hey, Bones
I ran a check on STC

16:50.800 --> 16:52.800
They're part of the
tin-foil hat squad

16:52.900 --> 16:54.400
What's that?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.000
They wear tin
little hats

16:56.100 --> 16:58.800
Probably to keep aliens
from controlling their minds

16:58.900 --> 16:59.900
Oh, schizophrenics

17:00.000 --> 17:01.600
It's hard to believe
that Colonel Howard

17:01.600 --> 17:03.500
was part of an organization
like that

17:04.300 --> 17:06.099
Do they have
access to planes?

17:06.200 --> 17:07.099
Access? You kidding me?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.500
They actually have a
"border patrol division"

17:09.700 --> 17:11.500
Members fly
their own private planes

17:11.599 --> 17:14.300
and do bimonthly sky patrols
in search of UFOs

17:14.500 --> 17:15.900
Do they file flight plans?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.500
Bones, you're a genius

17:17.500 --> 17:20.500
Look, two nights ago they
had planes on UFO patrol

17:20.500 --> 17:24.000
within spitting distance
of where Colonel Howard's
body was found

17:28.600 --> 17:30.100
Look, we're not
a collection of kooks

17:30.100 --> 17:32.500
Just ordinary people
with a mission

17:32.600 --> 17:34.800
to promote a friendly
liaison with the Visitors

17:34.900 --> 17:36.900
That's quite a
manifesto

17:37.200 --> 17:39.600
Until you've had an encounter
you couldn't possibly
understand

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
You've been abducted?

17:40.800 --> 17:42.100
Multiple times

17:42.100 --> 17:45.600
Mm-hmm
Through hypnosis I've discovered
that medical testing was done

17:46.400 --> 17:47.200
and follow-ups were required

17:47.500 --> 17:51.500
Are there any side effects
from these medical
procedures?

17:51.900 --> 17:53.000
You mean like tin hats?

17:53.900 --> 17:56.300
Paranoia
outbursts of anger

17:56.500 --> 17:58.800
loss of connection
with reality?

17:58.900 --> 18:00.700
You asked me to come
I'm here

18:01.400 --> 18:03.400
I run a very successful
aeronautics engineering company

18:04.000 --> 18:04.600
I'm richer than God

18:05.100 --> 18:06.800
Do I appear to have lost
contact with reality?

18:06.800 --> 18:09.800
Well, what about post
abduction syndrome?

18:09.800 --> 18:12.100
Similar to post traumatic
stress disorder

18:12.300 --> 18:13.900
P.A.S. is very real

18:14.100 --> 18:15.300
I admit to bouts with it

18:16.000 --> 18:17.400
Frankly, it's one
of my main motivators

18:17.800 --> 18:19.800
When we meet the Visitors
face-to-face

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
they will explain
so many things to us

18:22.400 --> 18:23.800
Including why you were taken

18:23.900 --> 18:25.200
And why they put
an implant in me

18:25.300 --> 18:26.400
Only then to remove it

18:27.400 --> 18:28.100
Great

18:28.200 --> 18:31.600
- Do you, uh... know this guy?
- Colonel Howard, Of course

18:31.800 --> 18:35.800
- So it's true that you offered him
a position with the STC?
- Yes

18:36.300 --> 18:39.000
As a method of bringing credibility
to your organization?

18:39.500 --> 18:42.200
Yes, but you have to
understand it was Colonel Howard
who came to us

18:43.800 --> 18:44.600
Why?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.500
He wanted to pilot
our suborbital flights

18:46.900 --> 18:49.300
Till your spaceships were ready

18:49.400 --> 18:52.400
he was going to help
you look for the UFOs

18:52.400 --> 18:55.100
Laugh if you must, but Cal
didn't think we were crazy

18:55.700 --> 18:57.600
He'd seen something
himself up there, you know

18:57.800 --> 18:58.500
And he's hardly
the first

18:59.300 --> 19:01.600
Quite a few astronauts and
military pilots have reported

19:01.600 --> 19:03.200
seeing evidence
of the Visitors

19:03.300 --> 19:05.300
- Colonel Howard told you this?
- Yes, he did

19:05.400 --> 19:09.400
So trust me, I'd have been proud
to be the one who sent
Cal Howard back into space

19:10.100 --> 19:11.300
Would have been?

19:11.800 --> 19:12.800
He changed his mind

19:12.800 --> 19:13.900
Six weeks ago

19:14.000 --> 19:15.800
That didn't make you
a little angry?

19:16.800 --> 19:17.800
No, not angry

19:18.900 --> 19:20.000
Disappointed

19:20.100 --> 19:24.100
Great, Then you wouldn't
object to my partner and I
taking a look at your fleet of planes?

19:24.400 --> 19:25.300
No, not at all

19:25.700 --> 19:28.400
Why do you think
Colonel Howard changed his mind?

19:28.700 --> 19:29.800
They got to him

19:30.100 --> 19:31.400
Through his wife
I believe

19:31.400 --> 19:32.600
They?

19:32.600 --> 19:33.800
The Agency

19:34.100 --> 19:35.500
They can be
very persuasive

19:36.300 --> 19:37.200
Persuasive?

19:37.200 --> 19:40.000
In my opinion, the Agency would
rather have Cal die

19:40.000 --> 19:42.400
than have him announce to the
world he'd seen a Visitor

19:46.300 --> 19:48.500
That's not true
The Agency loved Cal

19:48.700 --> 19:49.600
They valued him

19:49.600 --> 19:51.400
Why didn't you tell
us about STC?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.800
Because it's embarrassing

19:54.100 --> 19:55.800
Cal wanted to get back into
space so badly

19:55.800 --> 19:57.600
he would even listen
to those crazy people

19:57.700 --> 19:59.600
Did you husband see
something up there?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.100
Yes, something that made him
sympathetic

20:01.100 --> 20:03.200
with Mr. Bahr's
organization?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.100
Well, obviously
you know that he did...

20:05.700 --> 20:06.700
or he said he did

20:06.700 --> 20:07.600
And you doubted him?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.100
It doesn't really
matter now

20:09.200 --> 20:11.000
You know, that was
three years ago

20:11.300 --> 20:12.600
It was his last mission

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
And the Agency
explained it in such a way
that Cal was satisfied

20:15.700 --> 20:18.200
Look, it's important that we
know the truth, Mrs. Howard

20:19.800 --> 20:20.400
Why?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.800
Because from
what I've seen your husband
was a man of principle

20:22.800 --> 20:26.600
and if he saw something
he wouldn't just back down to
save his career with the Agency

20:27.100 --> 20:29.000
Even if his wife
begged him to

20:32.800 --> 20:35.500
He insisted on filing
an official report

20:36.400 --> 20:37.600
He wouldn't withdraw it

20:37.800 --> 20:39.400
- They asked him to?
- Yes

20:39.500 --> 20:40.800
But he stuck by his story

20:41.500 --> 20:42.200
They weren't happy with him

20:42.200 --> 20:44.500
but like I said
that's ancient history

20:49.300 --> 20:51.600
Cal's friend knew about the STC
his wife knew

20:51.600 --> 20:53.100
Maybe the Agency did as well

20:53.200 --> 20:55.500
What, so they killed him
by tossing him out
of an airplane?

20:55.600 --> 20:58.700
That field is less than a mile
from the coastline

20:58.800 --> 21:01.200
Obviously they were aiming
at the ocean and they missed

21:01.200 --> 21:02.100
Well, the question is why?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.800
It's a big ocean, right?

21:03.900 --> 21:07.200
- There has to be a reason
- Maybe it wasn't a UFO
that Cal saw

21:07.500 --> 21:09.400
- Ah...
- He could have seen
something else

21:09.600 --> 21:13.200
Oh, yeah, like--
a death beam or a space baby

21:13.300 --> 21:14.700
I was thinking more
along the lines

21:14.700 --> 21:17.700
of a spy satellite
or experimental technology

21:17.800 --> 21:20.100
No, Maybe the Agency
was afraid

21:20.200 --> 21:23.300
that Cal was sharing sensitive
information with the SCT

21:23.300 --> 21:27.300
Well, regardless
our government does not kill people
okay, Bones?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.200
You were a sniper

21:29.500 --> 21:32.100
Wasn't it our government
who sent you to kill people?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.000
Just saying

21:43.700 --> 21:45.900
Mmm
something smells good

21:46.200 --> 21:47.400
Help yourself

21:52.600 --> 21:53.500
Ho!

21:55.600 --> 21:56.700
These definitely human bones?

21:57.800 --> 22:00.000
'Cause apparently
there are a few types
of aliens

22:00.000 --> 22:03.700
races, if you will
One is quite reptilian
widely known as "Grays"

22:03.800 --> 22:05.000
Definitely human

22:05.100 --> 22:06.800
Another's bone structure's
more amphibian

22:07.100 --> 22:09.000
These bones are as human
as you are

22:09.200 --> 22:12.600
Oh, if you only knew
how irony-packed that is

22:13.100 --> 22:15.000
It's a joke

22:15.100 --> 22:17.900
Don't you be coming around
to boil me in the middle
of the night

22:18.500 --> 22:22.500
There's a strange callous
formation on his right
femoral head

22:22.700 --> 22:25.700
Also bone marrow edema
in the same spot

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
Healing from a fracture?

22:26.800 --> 22:30.300
No. Some kind of tuberous
cortical defect

22:30.600 --> 22:32.600
I've never seen anything
like this before

22:32.900 --> 22:34.700
Now you're freaking me out

22:35.400 --> 22:37.300
I have to get Dr. Brennan
to take a look at this

22:37.600 --> 22:41.300
It looks like he was
in the initial stages
of osteonecrosis

22:42.100 --> 22:43.700
What did you get
from the tox screen?

22:44.200 --> 22:49.500
Excess levels of vitamins D
K, E, A and C

22:50.300 --> 22:53.700
along with glutamine peptides
and creatine monohydrate

22:53.700 --> 22:56.500
All the supplements
he was taking before his
last space mission

22:56.600 --> 22:59.300
There's something odd
about the texture of this bone

22:59.400 --> 23:02.400
Leucine
isoleucine and valine

23:03.200 --> 23:04.900
He foresaw going back
into space

23:05.100 --> 23:07.200
This is not bone

23:07.300 --> 23:07.900
What is it?

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
A callous has formed
over some kind of thick
porous substance

23:12.500 --> 23:13.900
Careful

23:14.100 --> 23:16.200
It's an implant of some kind

23:16.600 --> 23:18.700
I never saw anything
on the X rays

23:19.100 --> 23:20.600
How could that not show up
on X rays?

23:23.200 --> 23:25.600
What the hell is this?

23:27.800 --> 23:30.300
Zoantharia of the order
scleractinia

23:30.800 --> 23:33.800
Scleractinia has a calcium-
carbonate exoskeleton

23:33.900 --> 23:36.000
with a porosity similar
to human bone

23:36.100 --> 23:37.500
Which would make it
biocompatible

23:37.600 --> 23:39.300
So it wouldn't
show up on X rays

23:39.400 --> 23:42.100
Wait. So this is coral
like from a reef?

23:42.300 --> 23:45.900
Suspended in a biphasic
hydroxyapatite-tricalcium-
phosphate coating

23:46.000 --> 23:49.400
Theoretically, the calcium
from the exoskeleton would grow

23:49.500 --> 23:53.200
hopefully overcoming the loss
of his degenerating bone

23:53.300 --> 23:55.500
Then this attachment
would be...?

23:55.700 --> 23:58.500
An electromagnetic device
implanted to accelerate growth

23:58.500 --> 24:01.700
So it's a combination
of human and alien technology

24:01.800 --> 24:03.000
Don't say that to Booth

24:03.100 --> 24:06.100
But if that's the case
then all the vitamins
and amino acids

24:06.200 --> 24:08.900
he was loaded up with
work mainly to ward
off infection

24:09.000 --> 24:10.200
And he'd need them, too

24:10.600 --> 24:11.900
Bone marrow's highly
susceptible

24:11.900 --> 24:14.500
This is a very risky procedure

24:14.800 --> 24:17.300
I got to say it-- Frank Olson

24:17.900 --> 24:19.800
He was a U.S. Army scientist
in the '50s

24:19.900 --> 24:22.700
and an unwitting participant
in Project MK Ultra

24:22.900 --> 24:24.300
They said
he committed suicide

24:24.300 --> 24:27.300
but an exhumation
45 years later
proved he was murdered

24:28.200 --> 24:31.700
You need more
Project Paperclip
MK Artichoke

24:31.800 --> 24:33.200
and who could forget
Tuskegee?

24:33.500 --> 24:37.000
The government experiments
on people and then
abandons them or worse

24:37.100 --> 24:38.400
What's the point
of this experiment?

24:38.500 --> 24:42.500
The main obstacle
to long-term space travel
is bone demineralization

24:42.800 --> 24:45.600
If the space program
could overcome this one effect

24:46.200 --> 24:48.700
their funding would triple
overnight

24:48.700 --> 24:49.800
Well, there you go

24:50.200 --> 24:52.500
Experimental program
for deep space fails

24:52.600 --> 24:54.400
and the evidence has
to be gotten rid of

24:54.500 --> 24:55.800
By tossing it
from a plane?

24:55.900 --> 24:58.200
Why not just have
the visitors toss him
into the sun?

24:58.300 --> 25:00.100
That is a good question

25:00.100 --> 25:01.400
No, it's not

25:01.500 --> 25:03.400
Sometimes when people try
to cover things up

25:03.400 --> 25:04.900
it goes wrong, that's all

25:04.900 --> 25:06.200
First thing
we should do

25:06.200 --> 25:09.000
is find out
the source of this technology

25:12.000 --> 25:15.200
Colonel Reid
was Cal's commanding officer
on three missions

25:15.300 --> 25:17.900
So you were the person to whom
he reported the UFO sighting?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.900
Oh, for God's sake

25:20.000 --> 25:23.500
You see what happens?
You people get all secretive
about things and...

25:23.700 --> 25:26.400
What Cal saw was space junk

25:26.500 --> 25:29.800
It was satellite parts
a discarded hatch
a screwdriver

25:29.900 --> 25:31.400
That information isn't cleared

25:31.500 --> 25:33.100
Sounded like more
than a screwdriver

25:33.100 --> 25:34.300
Well, it wasn't

25:34.300 --> 25:36.000
Cal just thought
we should be able to explain

25:36.100 --> 25:40.100
why it was whizzing around
space at 25,000 miles an hour
and that's all

25:40.700 --> 25:43.400
Was Colonel Howard in a cast
recently?

25:44.200 --> 25:47.100
Last winter
said he broke his leg
parasailing in the Caribbean

25:47.400 --> 25:49.900
All of our astronauts
suffer from brittle bones

25:50.100 --> 25:53.300
I stepped off a ladder once
and my tibia snapped
like a twig

25:53.600 --> 25:54.400
Why do you ask?

25:54.500 --> 25:55.700
Because of this

25:56.500 --> 25:58.400
We found it
in Colonel Howard's leg

25:58.400 --> 26:02.200
We think it's designed
to counteract the effects
of osteonecrosis

26:02.400 --> 26:05.000
Experimental surgery
on one of our astronauts?

26:05.100 --> 26:06.400
Absolutely not

26:06.700 --> 26:10.100
Our efforts to counter
bone loss are limited
to strength-and-resistance

26:10.100 --> 26:11.400
training and supplements

26:11.400 --> 26:13.100
I trust you have documentation

26:15.200 --> 26:16.400
Follow me

26:16.900 --> 26:17.900
Thank you

26:19.700 --> 26:20.800
Colonel

26:21.200 --> 26:22.800
have you ever
seen anything

26:23.200 --> 26:26.100
any screwdrivers up there?

26:26.300 --> 26:28.600
There's an awful lot up there
to see, Doctor

26:28.900 --> 26:31.000
Trick is not to let it
cloud your judgment

26:31.100 --> 26:32.300
Did it ever cloud Cal's?

26:32.400 --> 26:34.400
Never, not once

26:34.700 --> 26:37.900
And yet he wanted to go back
into space so badly

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
in spite of the physical
damage it had caused him

26:41.100 --> 26:42.200
the pain he was in

26:42.300 --> 26:43.200
Let me show you something

26:45.900 --> 26:48.400
You see this?
That's me

26:48.400 --> 26:50.100
And that there, that's Cal

26:50.300 --> 26:52.600
20 minutes I spent out there
that day

26:52.900 --> 26:55.500
and it is the last thing
I think about every night

26:55.600 --> 26:56.600
I can imagine...

26:56.700 --> 26:59.000
No. All due respect
you really can't

26:59.500 --> 27:02.100
This was the best moment
of my life, counting marriage

27:02.400 --> 27:03.800
kids, everything

27:04.000 --> 27:06.200
I'm not saying
that's good or right

27:06.500 --> 27:08.300
but I do know
it was the same for Cal

27:08.400 --> 27:10.200
for all of us who went up there

27:10.800 --> 27:12.900
And we would do anything
we could to get back

27:15.900 --> 27:18.000
This coral's growth
was aided artificially

27:18.000 --> 27:21.300
It was seeded
with resin beads
on glass plates

27:22.300 --> 27:24.700
Which makes it rare
enough to trace to a
pharmaceutical supply house

27:24.700 --> 27:26.700
based in Geneva, Switzerland

27:26.800 --> 27:28.200
I searched the literature

27:28.300 --> 27:31.600
There's a number of clinics
and researchers working on
bone replacement

27:31.700 --> 27:35.100
The doctor most likely to
have performed this procedure
on our victim

27:35.200 --> 27:36.600
is Dr. Henry Pascal

27:36.800 --> 27:37.800
In Switzerland?

27:37.800 --> 27:40.400
Based in Bethesda
with a clinic in Haiti

27:40.500 --> 27:44.000
plus he worked
for the space agency
until 1998

27:44.100 --> 27:44.600
What happened?

27:44.700 --> 27:47.100
He lost his funding and turned
to the private sector

27:47.300 --> 27:49.800
namely the Space Travel Coalition

27:50.700 --> 27:53.200
The foil hat squad
funds this guy?

27:53.700 --> 27:55.100
Booth is going to love that

27:55.200 --> 27:58.400
- Why?
- Because he doesn't believe
in coincidences

28:01.400 --> 28:03.500
Cal wasn't on vacation
when he hurt his leg

28:03.600 --> 28:05.800
He was in Haiti
for a convention

28:05.900 --> 28:09.200
Can you think of any
reason Colonel Reid would tell us
a different story?

28:09.300 --> 28:10.300
No

28:10.600 --> 28:12.200
Please, what
what's going on?

28:13.100 --> 28:15.300
We found evidence
in your husband's remains

28:15.300 --> 28:19.300
that he underwent
an experimental surgery in Haiti

28:19.600 --> 28:21.300
What kind
of experimental surgery?

28:21.400 --> 28:23.000
To replace his bone loss

28:23.100 --> 28:24.600
That sound like him?

28:24.700 --> 28:25.600
Yes

28:25.700 --> 28:28.400
Was it like your husband
to keep it a secret from you?

28:29.100 --> 28:30.200
Yes

28:31.900 --> 28:33.400
Cal wouldn't want me to worry

28:37.500 --> 28:41.300
Cal Howard's skeleton
before...

28:41.700 --> 28:44.100
and after
he fell to Earth

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Every bone showed trauma

28:48.500 --> 28:52.100
His clothing before...

28:53.400 --> 28:55.600
and after he fell to Earth

28:55.700 --> 28:58.100
Ripped
every seam pulled apart

28:58.100 --> 29:00.600
If I make the clothing
translucent...

29:04.200 --> 29:06.500
we can see that some
of the clothing damage

29:06.600 --> 29:08.700
lines up with the trauma
to his skeleton

29:08.700 --> 29:11.400
And if you isolate the bone
damage caused by a device

29:11.500 --> 29:14.200
capable of making robust cuts
in a linear path...

29:14.300 --> 29:16.300
The guy was chopped

29:16.500 --> 29:17.100
he chopped?

29:17.200 --> 29:19.600
Yeah. Clothing damage
flesh wounds

29:19.700 --> 29:20.800
Bone damage

29:21.300 --> 29:21.900
He was chopped

29:22.500 --> 29:24.900
Ange, tonight
you and me 

29:25.000 --> 29:27.200
reservations at
Les Deux Copains 8:00

29:27.300 --> 29:29.300
Wow, fancy

29:29.400 --> 29:31.100
Suit-and-gown fancy, baby

29:31.200 --> 29:32.400
So leave your mukluks at home

29:32.500 --> 29:33.600
What's the occasion?

29:33.700 --> 29:36.700
An ax or hatchet
or machete makes sharp
well-defined cuts

29:36.800 --> 29:38.300
These edges are abraded

29:38.300 --> 29:39.700
This our guy?

29:39.900 --> 29:42.600
Hey, do aliens use any weapons
resembling a...?

29:42.600 --> 29:43.800
A broadsword?

29:43.900 --> 29:45.100
How about a light saber?

29:45.100 --> 29:47.600
No, those can cut through
any known substance

29:47.700 --> 29:49.700
The victim would have
been completely
dismembered

29:49.700 --> 29:52.100
If they existed, Zack

29:52.800 --> 29:56.300
Makeup hair done
high heels
the whole enchilada

29:56.500 --> 29:59.000
Only whatever's French
for "enchilada"

29:59.200 --> 30:01.300
No mukluks. Got it

30:05.900 --> 30:09.800
Dr. Pascal
Colonel Calvin Howard is dead

30:11.200 --> 30:12.800
Not because of anything I did

30:12.900 --> 30:14.700
Wow, didn't even blink

30:14.700 --> 30:16.500
Colonel Howard
sought me out

30:17.200 --> 30:18.000
I know how he died?

30:18.100 --> 30:20.200
Let's just say it was
a really bad fall

30:20.500 --> 30:21.900
And what's this got
to do with me?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.700
Was your procedure a success?

30:23.800 --> 30:25.100
How do you define success?

30:25.200 --> 30:27.300
Just answer the question

30:27.400 --> 30:29.400
That's actually a fair question

30:29.500 --> 30:31.100
The results were heartening

30:31.100 --> 30:34.300
There were extremely painful
calluses growing over your implant

30:34.400 --> 30:35.600
I'd very much like to see that

30:35.600 --> 30:39.200
And there was no indication
of an actual reversal of necrosis

30:39.200 --> 30:41.500
The calluses were part
of the healing process

30:41.700 --> 30:45.700
See, coral resorption is slow
but effective as a scaffold
for osteoprogenitor cells

30:46.500 --> 30:49.400
Incorporating
the electrode was
speeding the process

30:50.000 --> 30:53.900
In my opinion
Cal was only months away
from having mature lamellar bone

30:54.000 --> 30:56.700
No way to know for sure now
right?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.400
- Correct
- Probably to your benefit
to terminate your experiment

30:59.400 --> 31:00.700
before it went wrong

31:00.700 --> 31:03.700
Keep those venture capitalists
on the edge of their seats

31:05.000 --> 31:07.100
You think I pushed
Colonel Howard off a ladder

31:07.100 --> 31:09.200
Or out of an airplane

31:11.400 --> 31:14.300
Look, you can have all my data

31:14.600 --> 31:16.300
my projections
everything

31:16.600 --> 31:20.100
Colonel Howard goes
on the next shuttle mission
to repair the Lansing Telescope

31:20.200 --> 31:22.400
I'm in every medical
journal in the country

31:23.200 --> 31:25.200
That mission's a month away

31:25.400 --> 31:26.600
Would his body have been ready?

31:26.600 --> 31:28.500
At the rate Cal was healing
I believe so

31:28.900 --> 31:30.800
Did anyone at the Agency
know about this?

31:31.400 --> 31:33.800
We were going to petition them
officially next month

31:34.800 --> 31:36.100
Look, you may not like me

31:36.100 --> 31:38.800
but I was his savior
and he was mine

31:39.900 --> 31:42.100
I didn't kill Colonel Howard

31:47.500 --> 31:48.800
Somebody's lying
to us, right?

31:48.800 --> 31:50.400
Yeah, maybe everybody

31:51.100 --> 31:51.900
Well, this is
your strength

31:52.100 --> 31:54.300
reading people's minds
telling them they're lying

31:54.700 --> 31:56.800
My strength?
Wait a sec
The trouble is-- no, no,--

31:56.800 --> 32:00.400
you haven't given me anything
that I can spring on the suspect
to see how he reacts

32:00.600 --> 32:02.600
- Like what?
- Oh, like a murder weapon

32:02.600 --> 32:04.700
or whether or not the poor
bastard was dead
before he hit the ground

32:04.800 --> 32:06.300
Zack and Angela say he was

32:06.400 --> 32:07.500
Okay, well, that's something
Dead how?

32:07.700 --> 32:09.500
Best guess right now
a broadsword

32:09.500 --> 32:10.400
A broadsword?

32:11.400 --> 32:12.400
Like King Arthur?

32:12.400 --> 32:13.100
Yes

32:13.400 --> 32:14.200
Broadsword

32:15.200 --> 32:18.200
You know what, Bones
I like the whole alien thing
much better. Broadsword?

32:18.300 --> 32:20.000
Where do you people come up
with this stuff?

32:20.200 --> 32:21.900
I didn't say
an actual broadsword

32:22.000 --> 32:23.500
I said,
"Like a broadsword"

32:23.900 --> 32:26.000
It was the closest analog
I could access

32:26.100 --> 32:28.000
No traces from the weapon
left on the bone?

32:28.100 --> 32:30.900
Traces are left
when the weapon cuts deeply
into the bone

32:30.900 --> 32:34.800
Whatever this was
wasn't very sharp
Left nothing behind

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
How about shape?

32:36.000 --> 32:39.100
The pattern is consistent with
sharp-force trauma

32:39.800 --> 32:42.900
from a curved blade
approximately
65 millimeters thick

32:42.900 --> 32:46.000
And if I am late for dinner
I will find whatever it is

32:46.200 --> 32:47.300
and I will hit
you with it

32:47.700 --> 32:49.400
Wow, you...

32:49.400 --> 32:51.000
you look incredible

32:51.100 --> 32:52.300
- You really do
- You know what else?

32:52.300 --> 32:55.400
I can tell just by
looking at you--
you smell great

32:55.400 --> 32:57.000
You cannot see smell

32:58.600 --> 33:00.000
The victim was struck
four times

33:00.200 --> 33:02.500
A glancing blow to the head
right humerus

33:02.500 --> 33:04.400
thoracic, and left femur

33:04.400 --> 33:06.200
We couldn't figure out
in what order

33:06.500 --> 33:08.300
It's almost as though
it were simultaneous

33:08.400 --> 33:10.100
The blow to the head is
what killed him

33:10.300 --> 33:12.500
Come on, four hits
simultaneously with a broadsword

33:12.500 --> 33:14.400
What was he
attacked by the knights
of the roundtable?

33:14.600 --> 33:17.000
65 millimeters
is too thick for a sword

33:17.000 --> 33:18.300
Did you estimate
a velocity?

33:18.300 --> 33:21.700
It was moving at a velocity
of approximately
116 meters per second

33:22.000 --> 33:23.100
What's that in American?

33:23.500 --> 33:24.900
About 260 miles per hour

33:24.900 --> 33:26.900
All right, look
I'm no expert in broadswords

33:27.000 --> 33:29.800
- but I do know...
- I know what happened

33:30.400 --> 33:31.700
How fast does a propeller turn?

33:32.000 --> 33:34.300
At full speed, the tips approach
the speed of sound

33:34.400 --> 33:36.500
But Howard exits the airplane
in flight

33:36.900 --> 33:38.800
The propeller
is ahead of him
and pulling away

33:38.800 --> 33:40.600
How could he come
into contact with it?

33:40.700 --> 33:41.900
There are pusher propellers

33:41.900 --> 33:43.200
It didn't happen in the air

33:43.300 --> 33:45.500
He was pushed into a propeller?

33:45.700 --> 33:48.100
He would've turned
into steak tartare

33:48.200 --> 33:49.600
Scratch one item
off the menu tonight

33:49.600 --> 33:51.600
Not if the plane was idling

33:52.000 --> 33:55.200
Propeller speeds would decrease
to a thousand or so RPMs

33:55.300 --> 33:56.300
- Let's go
- Where?

33:56.300 --> 33:57.500
We'll look for
a dented propeller

33:57.500 --> 33:59.400
Come on
Which you do
not need me for

34:04.100 --> 34:05.700
Hey
You're right, here they come

34:06.700 --> 34:08.199
I hope you have
another warrant

34:10.000 --> 34:13.100
This is for the hangar
not the individual planes

34:13.199 --> 34:15.199
Then why are your people
looking at propellers?

34:15.300 --> 34:17.699
Because the warrant
includes anything
that is in plain sight

34:18.000 --> 34:19.699
Plane sight

34:20.800 --> 34:21.400
Get it?

34:21.600 --> 34:22.500
It's a pun

34:22.600 --> 34:24.500
Yeah, and this is
not the only hangar
we'll be checking out

34:24.699 --> 34:27.199
What plane are you
looking for specifically?

34:27.300 --> 34:29.199
Well, we'll know it
when we see it

34:29.300 --> 34:31.900
We believe that Colonel Howard
was struck by a propeller

34:31.900 --> 34:35.100
We're looking for
blood stains using
alternate light sources

34:35.900 --> 34:37.800
You think Cal walked
into a propeller?

34:37.900 --> 34:40.100
No way he makes
a bonehead move like that

34:40.199 --> 34:41.900
We surmise
he was pushed

34:42.000 --> 34:42.699
But why?

34:42.699 --> 34:44.500
Here he was
this great guy

34:44.500 --> 34:47.400
but he was liability
to one of you

34:48.199 --> 34:49.000
One of us?

34:49.100 --> 34:50.300
Somebody wanted him dead

34:50.300 --> 34:51.699
That's ridiculous

34:51.800 --> 34:54.600
If it turned out that Cal
was able to reverse his bone loss

34:54.699 --> 34:55.900
would you put him
on the next shuttle?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.500
The one to repair the
Lansing Telescope again

34:58.800 --> 35:00.600
Colonel Adams is slated
for that mission

35:01.100 --> 35:02.000
Colonel Reid?

35:02.200 --> 35:04.500
Well, Cal would be
my first choice, yes

35:04.600 --> 35:05.700
All due respect, James

35:05.700 --> 35:08.300
But why send the student
when the teacher can go?

35:08.600 --> 35:09.800
Look, I take no offense

35:09.900 --> 35:10.900
Cal was the best

35:11.000 --> 35:12.700
Dr. Brennan
Agent Booth

35:16.100 --> 35:17.500
Blood
A lot of it

35:17.600 --> 35:20.200
It was washed
down this drain here
High-pressure hose

35:20.400 --> 35:22.500
Can you tell which plane's
propeller may have done this?

35:22.700 --> 35:24.600
Not within the parameters
of the current warrant

35:24.700 --> 35:26.700
Some of these planes
have covers on the propellers

35:26.800 --> 35:28.300
so we can't
see if they're damaged

35:29.100 --> 35:30.900
That is your plane
isn't it, James?

35:35.500 --> 35:36.600
Take it off

35:37.800 --> 35:39.500
Take off the cover, James

35:40.100 --> 35:41.600
I respectfully decline

35:42.000 --> 35:44.200
It's not his plane
it's the Agency's

35:49.300 --> 35:51.100
Propeller like that
wouldn't get you very far

35:51.500 --> 35:53.300
Certainly not
over the water

35:53.400 --> 35:56.800
Which is why you had
to dump Cal's body
short of the ocean

35:58.100 --> 35:58.800
Booth

35:59.100 --> 35:59.900
Booth

36:00.300 --> 36:01.400
It doesn't make sense

36:01.600 --> 36:04.000
The whole thing would take
at least two people--

36:04.000 --> 36:05.400
putting the body in the plane

36:05.500 --> 36:07.800
cleaning up the blood
shoving the body
out of the plane

36:08.000 --> 36:09.800
Who are you protecting?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.200
Mrs. Howard...

36:30.700 --> 36:31.800
Is Colleen here?

36:33.300 --> 36:34.800
Colleen came to see me off

36:35.700 --> 36:37.000
Saw me talking to Cal

36:38.600 --> 36:41.900
He was telling me that
he was going to be okay
in time for the mission

36:42.400 --> 36:44.300
He was sharing good news

36:45.700 --> 36:49.200
But it wasn't good
not to me

36:51.100 --> 36:53.900
She slapped him
that's all

36:54.300 --> 36:55.600
Because she loves me

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
She knew what it meant to me
not to go up

37:01.400 --> 37:04.200
Cal took a step back
just one

37:06.500 --> 37:08.200
He fell back into the propeller

37:08.800 --> 37:11.500
Why didn't you just say
it was an accident?

37:11.600 --> 37:13.100
I don't know
we panicked

37:13.400 --> 37:15.600
Would they believe us?
Would they understand?

37:15.600 --> 37:17.300
Would you ever get into space?

37:22.300 --> 37:25.800
It happened because my friend
shared good news with me

37:26.000 --> 37:27.800
and because my wife loves me

37:31.600 --> 37:32.900
I'm a blessed man

38:24.100 --> 38:25.200
How-how are you feeling?

38:26.200 --> 38:27.400
What do you mean?

38:27.600 --> 38:30.200
Good meal
nice bottle of wine

38:31.300 --> 38:32.900
You feeling loving?

38:34.500 --> 38:37.200
You didn't need to
do all of this to get me
in a loving mood

38:37.400 --> 38:38.600
I don't mean in that way

38:40.200 --> 38:42.700
I am madly in love
with you, Angela

38:43.200 --> 38:47.200
And you are the
most amazing woman
that I have ever met

38:47.600 --> 38:51.300
My life is so much
better since we...

38:51.400 --> 38:52.100
Oh, my God

38:52.700 --> 38:53.400
What?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.200
Are you breaking up with me?

38:56.100 --> 39:00.000
Why would I get you
all dressed up for dinner
just to break up?

39:01.100 --> 39:01.900
I don't know

39:03.400 --> 39:04.700
Because you're...

39:05.400 --> 39:07.600
I'm not thinking straight
Go ahead

39:07.700 --> 39:09.200
You know, I had this
all laid out in my mind

39:10.100 --> 39:11.700
You are an upsetting woman

39:11.800 --> 39:12.900
I'm sorry

39:14.300 --> 39:15.600
Please go ahead

39:27.000 --> 39:29.600
I believe that if two people
care enough for each other

39:29.900 --> 39:31.800
the rest of the world
disappears to them

39:32.800 --> 39:34.200
I feel that when I'm with you

39:43.100 --> 39:45.900
I'm prepared to put you ahead of
me for the rest of my life

39:47.800 --> 39:49.400
Angela Montenegro...

39:51.600 --> 39:52.900
will you marry me?

40:05.900 --> 40:06.800
Dear man

40:07.800 --> 40:09.300
good heart...

40:11.100 --> 40:12.100
No

40:15.500 --> 40:16.700
Why?

40:17.600 --> 40:19.400
I didn't do it
right again?

40:19.700 --> 40:22.100
But...
How?

40:22.700 --> 40:24.200
Oh, you're not
going to tell me

40:24.300 --> 40:25.500
I don't know
Hodgins

40:26.200 --> 40:27.600
If I knew
I would tell you

40:28.400 --> 40:31.200
But when you ask me
I have to have this...

40:32.200 --> 40:34.000
this feeling

40:34.100 --> 40:36.800
It has to be...

40:41.200 --> 40:42.400
I'll know it when it happens

40:42.600 --> 40:44.400
and I hope you
won't stop trying

40:45.800 --> 40:46.800
I don't know whether
I should laugh

40:46.900 --> 40:48.800
cry or punch out the sommelier

40:49.400 --> 40:50.600
I'm sorry

40:51.600 --> 40:53.200
I hope that you choose laugh

40:54.000 --> 40:55.200
I don't understand

40:55.400 --> 40:56.500
I don't either

40:57.300 --> 41:01.000
Look, let's just
finish the dessert and
go back to your place

41:01.100 --> 41:05.000
and make love and
maybe it'll come to me

41:05.300 --> 41:06.400
While we make love?

41:06.500 --> 41:07.600
I said maybe

41:12.200 --> 41:15.000
But you love me

41:19.000 --> 41:20.400
More than you know

41:31.500 --> 41:32.300
You eat yet?

41:32.400 --> 41:33.800
I said I'd wait

41:36.200 --> 41:38.300
How did you know that
James would tell me?

41:38.800 --> 41:40.200
Well, man loves his wife

41:40.300 --> 41:42.700
He may not be strong
but he has a conscience

41:42.800 --> 41:45.800
See, I...
I can't tell that stuff

41:45.900 --> 41:48.700
And I can't tell the difference
between coral and bone

41:48.800 --> 41:50.400
so guess we make a great pair

41:50.500 --> 41:53.900
Hey, speaking of marriage
Hodgins is going to
propose to Angela tonight

41:54.900 --> 41:55.800
What?

41:56.900 --> 41:59.200
I guess right now it looks
to me like marriage

42:00.000 --> 42:01.700
is having someone
who'll slap your enemies

42:01.700 --> 42:04.100
and then toss their dead
bodies out of airplanes

42:04.400 --> 42:06.100
Try not to mention
that to Angela

42:06.300 --> 42:10.300
