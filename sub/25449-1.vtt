00:35.503 --> 00:37.438
There we go. Watch your head.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.622
This is terrible.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.125
Does anyone know what
happened to him?

00:48.149 --> 00:51.495
No. No one does.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.759
But someone said that Alan tripped and fell
down the stairs at the Science Center.

00:54.783 --> 00:57.286
My God, I hope he's
going to be okay.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.138
God knows how long he
was laying there for.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.430
Anybody know that boy?

01:03.764 --> 01:04.798
I do.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.669
- All right.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.749
Detective Parker.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.152
Mind if I ask you a
few questions, girls?

01:15.176 --> 01:17.854
Sure, I guess.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.757
- Friend of yours?
- We went out a few times.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.392
What's your name?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.494
- Christine Roberts.
- Hmm.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.596
And how about you?
What's your name?

01:26.620 --> 01:29.366
Oh! Right, sorry.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.900
It's Amy.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.437
- Amy Thomas.
- All right.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.740
So when's the last time
either of you saw him?

01:36.764 --> 01:38.732
A day or so ago, I guess.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.416
That's who you should
be talking to.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.309
Marilyn. That's his girlfriend.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.521
His girlfriend?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.257
So I heard.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.625
Right.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.728
Fine. Well, thank you for your
time, ladies. I appreciate it.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.231
- Um, Detective Parker.
- Yeah?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.490
Is Alan going to be okay?

02:03.891 --> 02:05.171
He was dead when they found him.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.392
Christine, come on, let's go.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.251
Well, I'm sure glad to be
getting out of here right now.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.919
Why is that?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.821
Are you kidding me?

02:24.845 --> 02:27.724
Alan's dead. This whole campus
is going into a deep funk.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.668
Who'd want to stick around
and be a part of that?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.220
Well, some of us
don't have a choice.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.565
What do you mean?

02:35.589 --> 02:36.909
I'm kinda stranded
here, you know?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.340
Hey, who's this?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.466
Oh! That's my mom
and her husband.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.512
He's handsome.

02:48.536 --> 02:51.448
I guess. Never really
thought of him like that.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.906
They look perfect.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.953
They look like the
perfect couple.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.057
Well, looks aren't everything. So, what,
you're staying here for the holidays?

03:01.749 --> 03:04.485
Yeah, my folks are out
of the country, so...

03:06.454 --> 03:08.265
Well, you know, what can you do?

03:08.289 --> 03:10.700
Well, you can come home with me.
My mom won't mind.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.502
No, thank you, but I couldn't.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.339
No, I'm serious. I insist.

03:15.363 --> 03:18.603
Now go pack your bag. We're getting out of
this morgue first thing in the morning.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.868
Okay.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.604
Okay.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.779
Hey.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.648
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.384
You're up and out early.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.686
Yeah, I had a showing.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.025
Got it. Any luck?

04:09.049 --> 04:11.695
Oh, who knows?

04:11.719 --> 04:13.697
I mean, sales are
down all over town.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.332
I haven't sold
anything in a month.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.033
I hear you.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.759
I keep trying.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.562
It's all you can do.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.677
I think I know who that is.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.061
Oh, I want to change out of my
good clothes. Would you mind?

04:30.085 --> 04:31.553
I got it.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.713
Why do you always have the door
locked when you know I'm coming home?

04:40.881 --> 04:42.049
Never can be too careful.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.377
It's like you don't
even want me around.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.865
Hello, Christine.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.990
Hello.

04:51.559 --> 04:52.702
Now, who's this?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.738
Uh, this is my friend Amy.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.482
She didn't have anywhere to go for
the break, so I brought her along.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.708
She won't eat much.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.944
- Hello, Amy.
- Hi, Mr. Benton.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.812
Please, don't be so stuffy.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.449
If you're a friend of
Christine's, call me Charles.

05:05.473 --> 05:10.019
Okay, Charles. Thank you for having me.
I'll try not to be a bother.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.363
I'm sure there won't
be a problem.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.990
Where's Mom?

05:14.014 --> 05:15.854
Oh, she had some work
around town this morning.

05:15.878 --> 05:17.761
She's changing out
of her work clothes.

05:17.785 --> 05:18.828
Did she sell anything?

05:18.852 --> 05:19.920
Not yet...

05:21.054 --> 05:22.656
but she has some interest.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.095
Okay, come on. Let's go
put our bags in my room.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.443
And this is my room.

05:33.467 --> 05:36.780
It's only got the one
bed, but it's a big one.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.549
It's big enough for two.

05:39.573 --> 05:43.387
There is a guest room on the other
side of the house if you prefer that.

05:43.411 --> 05:48.492
Oh, no, this is fine. Really, I wouldn't
want to be alone in a big new house anyway.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.759
Me neither.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.452
So Charles seems really nice.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.631
So handsome, too.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.734
Yeah, I mean, he's one of the top
copyright attorneys in town.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.704
Except he's not my dad.
He's my step-dad.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.772
- Right.
- Not that there's...

06:02.796 --> 06:06.543
He's a really great guy. Don't
get me wrong. It's just...

06:06.567 --> 06:09.613
He's the kind of guy who
never wanted kids, you know.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.616
I always wondered why you lived on
campus when your house is so close by.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.851
It's really not a
big deal, I just...

06:14.875 --> 06:18.522
I kinda wanted to give him and my
mom their own space. You know?

06:18.546 --> 06:21.190
Trust me, Christine, I get it.

06:21.214 --> 06:25.061
I know what it's like to be in
the way of other people's lives.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.998
What's that?

06:29.022 --> 06:31.501
That's Mr. Chips.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.903
Hello, little buddy.
Did you miss me?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.162
You have a rat?

06:36.497 --> 06:37.531
He's a hamster.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.044
- Mmm. That's a rat.
- N Shh.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.036
You may hurt his feelings.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.483
He kinda smells funny.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.986
Yeah, my mom might've gotten a little
bit behind on cleaning the cage.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.445
She gets forgetful sometimes.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.759
Where is your mom anyway?

06:55.783 --> 06:56.950
We should go find her.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.487
Yeah.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.472
- There you are!
- Oh, Christine.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.040
Sweetie, I thought I
heard you come in.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.576
Charles said you were
getting dressed.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.077
Yes, I had an early morning.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.545
Who is your friend?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.947
Hi, Mrs. Benton. I'm Amy.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.851
Amy didn't have anywhere
to go for the holidays,

07:19.875 --> 07:21.685
so I invited her to
tag along with me.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.886
I said you wouldn't mind.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.755
Oh! No. It's fine. Of course.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.224
Yeah. I was just fixing lunch.
You girls want a sandwich?

07:28.248 --> 07:31.528
Uh, no, thank you. I had
a really big breakfast.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.498
I will have one, please,
with extra mayo.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.967
You got it, sweetheart. Oh, and
Amy, please call me Anna, okay?

07:37.991 --> 07:39.993
Okay, Anna.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.673
Oh, Charles, the ice
maker's acting up again.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.008
Really?

07:45.032 --> 07:46.567
Okay, I'll take a look.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.343
It's that one piece of ice that
always gets stuck in the back.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.053
That oughta do it.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.589
But it's going to take a while before
it makes enough ice for everybody.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.725
Maybe I should just run to
the store and get a bag.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.527
- Would you mind?
- Of course not.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.728
Anybody want a ride along?

08:04.752 --> 08:07.664
Mmm, no, thank you.
I'm about to eat.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.923
I'll go... if that's okay.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.570
Sure, we'll be back soon.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.739
Christine, do you need anything?

08:15.763 --> 08:16.897
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.212
So, Mom, how goes the war?

08:23.236 --> 08:26.716
Well, could be
better, hon, I mean,

08:26.740 --> 08:28.140
no one wants to buy
a house anymore.

08:28.164 --> 08:29.753
Well, at least you're trying.

08:29.777 --> 08:34.823
Yeah. Yeah, I am trying, but
am I trying hard enough?

08:34.847 --> 08:38.207
Are we talking about real estate or are we
talking about what's going on around here?

08:38.885 --> 08:40.664
Both.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.765
I seemed to have lost
that spark, you know?

08:42.789 --> 08:45.270
That thing that keeps every day
from being like the day before.

08:45.294 --> 08:46.770
Now everything is
just a routine.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.105
Can't always be fireworks.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.174
I know. I just feel like

08:51.198 --> 08:53.266
I need to shake it up
every once in a while.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.018
So how long have you and
Christine been friends?

09:01.141 --> 09:02.542
A little while now.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.723
She's never mentioned me?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.357
No, but she doesn't
really confide in me.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.827
I'm not her father, you know.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.651
She doesn't come home as
often as she used to.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.455
Oh, well, I talk about
Christine all the time.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.770
But I'm also just a chatterbox,

09:20.794 --> 09:23.394
I say whatever's on my mind whether
people want to hear it or not.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.818
A person could get in a
lot of trouble like that.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.680
No kidding.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.384
So why didn't you go home for the break?
Won't your family miss you?

09:34.942 --> 09:39.255
Yeah, well, they're... my
family's in Europe, actually.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.848
They go every year, so...

09:42.950 --> 09:46.062
You know, there's nothing for
me but a big empty house.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.287
That's too bad.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.735
You'll have a great
time with us.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.040
You know, you're much better
looking than your photograph.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.130
Thanks.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.033
I think.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.655
So, Amy, hon, tell me, what
kind of courses are you taking?

10:11.679 --> 10:13.757
Oh, I'm a pre-med student.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.861
Yeah, although, I don't know
how long that will last.

10:15.885 --> 10:17.260
Why's that?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.796
Amy hates being
around sick people.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.065
- Liar!
- It's the truth.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.299
It's true.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.135
Okay, I just...

10:26.159 --> 10:29.706
I think it's kind of
depressing, don't you?

10:29.730 --> 10:33.009
Well, that's a curious career
choice then, isn't it?

10:33.033 --> 10:36.279
Yeah. Yeah, totally. My
dad badgered me into it.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.848
And why would he do that?

10:38.872 --> 10:41.350
Because he thinks there's
no future in chemistry.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.986
Oh, you're interested
in chemistry?

10:43.010 --> 10:46.089
Yeah. Yeah, I'm actually
pretty good at it.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.158
And still, it's a very
disciplined course, but,

10:49.182 --> 10:52.361
you know, not good
enough for my dad.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.163
What does your dad do, hon?

10:54.187 --> 10:57.400
He's an engineer. Yeah,
he builds things.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.704
He was a Seabee in the Gulf War.

11:00.728 --> 11:04.974
Oh, a military man. It's probably where
you get your sense of discipline from.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.911
Um, can you make some of
it rub off on Christine?

11:07.935 --> 11:09.913
Her room is always such a mess.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.438
Ha-ha! Very funny.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.419
Well, if I had a home
as beautiful as this,

11:16.443 --> 11:17.811
I would never let it get messy.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.749
"Where thou art, that is home."

11:24.351 --> 11:25.919
Are you sure you're
only 21 years old?

11:27.354 --> 11:29.222
Oh. 21 and a half.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.082
Doesn't he ever sleep?

11:46.106 --> 11:48.251
Of course, he does.
During the day.

11:48.275 --> 11:51.220
Oh. Great.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.222
He's really very sweet.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.758
You'll get used to him.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.026
Maybe.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.396
He does smell better now
that you cleaned his cage.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.967
You will learn to love
him just like I did.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.335
Well, I don't know. I don't
fall in love very easily.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.537
Here.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.974
Did my mom see you with these?

12:10.998 --> 12:12.942
No, I think everybody's asleep.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.178
Why, is it a problem?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.246
No, I'm just wondering. Cheers.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.039
Cheers.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.920
You know, you're actually very
pretty when you take those off.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.896
Ouch.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.254
You know what I mean.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.334
No, actually I'm not sure
I do know what you mean.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.169
I'm just kidding around, Amy.

12:40.193 --> 12:44.107
I know. I know what you mean.
Guys don't make passes...

12:44.131 --> 12:46.242
and all that.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.543
I'm just messing with you.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.479
I know, it's just...

12:50.503 --> 12:53.549
you're so beautiful...
so perfect.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.451
I feel like everything
comes so easily for you.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.421
No, I'm just lucky.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.347
I want you to do something for me.
Come on.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.162
I want you...

13:06.186 --> 13:08.922
- Yes?
- I want you to take your hair down.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.500
No.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.244
- Come on.
- No, Christine, I don't do that.

13:13.268 --> 13:14.603
Come on, just do it.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.429
- Why?
- Let it go.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.834
- Come on.
- Okay.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.874
See! See?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.978
Look at how gorgeous you are.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.062
You're sweet, but...

13:39.086 --> 13:42.990
I could never get a guy like
Alan to even look at me twice.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.159
Yeah. Well...

13:48.428 --> 13:50.497
you didn't miss much.
He was kind of a jerk.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.585
Still, it's really horrible
what happened to him.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.438
Yeah. Just horrible.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.488
Hey, um...

14:05.512 --> 14:09.158
how come you never told that detective
that Alan used to be your boyfriend?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.194
"Used to be" is right.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.658
Why would I want to
get involved now?

14:15.222 --> 14:16.856
He went off with someone else.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.859
She should be the
one they question.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.963
Amy...

14:40.380 --> 14:42.658
If Alan were my boyfriend,

14:42.682 --> 14:44.884
I'd never let him
fall like that.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.355
Never.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.407
Good morning, Anna.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.309
Morning, Amy.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.278
You're up awfully early.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.248
Yeah, I know. I wanted to
make breakfast for everybody.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.539
That's very nice of you.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.076
But why?

15:10.743 --> 15:14.423
Well, to be honest,

15:14.447 --> 15:17.626
it's one of the things I miss most
about not living at home anymore.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.463
The smell of fresh
coffee brewing,

15:20.487 --> 15:23.266
and pancakes on the griddle.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.530
Reminds me of the time when
my whole family was together.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.780
Everybody needs
somebody to care about.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.608
I hope... you don't
mind, do you?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.677
No! No! Of course not.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.280
I'm just a little
surprised, that's all.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.439
No, it's great.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.685
Oh, you're not wearing
your glasses.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.154
Oh, my goggles?

15:45.178 --> 15:48.124
I just put my contacts in when I don't
feel like wearing those anymore.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.282
Oh, you look very different.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.629
Different in a good way, I hope.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.493
Oh, of course, I didn't
mean it like that. Yes.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.035
- Good.
- Good morning.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.769
Hey, good morning, Charles.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.495
I made breakfast. Have a seat.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.199
Okay.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.995
Here you go. And be
careful with the syrup, I

16:14.007 --> 16:16.276
don't want you to get
in on your nice suit.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.858
Don't start spoiling me,
Amy, I might get used to it.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.085
I guess I'll go get dressed.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.126
Is it really spoiling someone to
make them a decent breakfast?

16:34.727 --> 16:37.473
You work very hard, Charles.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.775
It's important that people
make you feel appreciated.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.634
Even so, you don't
need to pamper me.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.647
Where's Christine?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.650
Oh, she's still asleep. Yeah,
she was so tired last night.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.352
Who knows when she'll wake up?

16:49.376 --> 16:52.155
She'll sleep till
noon if you let her.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.624
Well, it is holiday break and
she's been studying so hard.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.968
Sometimes I worry about her getting sick,
the way she burns the candle at both ends.

16:58.992 --> 17:00.796
It's not healthy.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.740
I think you're the first person to ever
accuse Christine of over-studying.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.525
But...

17:07.460 --> 17:10.373
you're right. Some people
deserve to sleep in.

17:10.396 --> 17:14.176
Right now, I have a
law firm to run.

17:14.201 --> 17:18.338
Oh. Let me get you a travel mug, so
you can take your coffee with you.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.617
Wow.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.176
You're going to make some
lucky man very happy one day.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.600
I sure hope so.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.168
Here.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.304
- Who opened this?
- I did.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.306
- You?
- Yeah.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.970
Christine and I had a few glasses
before we went to bed last night.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.413
I probably should've asked,

17:50.437 --> 17:52.815
but everyone was asleep,
so I just thought...

17:52.839 --> 17:56.152
It's no problem. I
was just curious.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.122
I'm going to replace it when I go to
the store today. I will replace that.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.214
Don't worry about it. Wine
is meant to be enjoyed.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.893
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.262
Breakfast was great.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.587
Yeah.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.643
Well, that is one nasty fall.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.107
I really don't know how something
like this could've happened.

18:23.131 --> 18:25.614
We have an almost
perfect safety record.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.151
Well, what troubled
me was all the blood.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.552
- The blood?
- Yeah.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.155
I mean, I can accept it
on the stairs there,

18:32.179 --> 18:34.523
where the body would naturally
hit the concrete steps.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.726
I can accept it at the bottom
where he finally landed.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.429
How does all this
blood get up here,

18:40.453 --> 18:42.931
before the body's even
fallen a single step?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.567
- Ed!
- Yeah?

18:44.591 --> 18:45.858
- Joe, you got it?
- I do.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.771
What's that?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.307
Coroner's initial report.

18:51.331 --> 18:55.178
According to this, Alan Kerwood received
blunt-force trauma to the head,

18:55.202 --> 18:57.313
prior to falling
down the stairs.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.515
Well, that explains the blood.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.883
What does it mean?

19:00.907 --> 19:02.427
It means that somebody
killed that boy.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.522
- Killed him?
- Yeah.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.524
They probably hit him
with something heavy,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.893
when he was standing right
about here, then...

19:10.917 --> 19:12.828
they just gave him
a little shove.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.430
Then it was murder?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.689
Yeah. What's your
school's record for that?

19:22.529 --> 19:23.849
Who'd want to kill Alan?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.875
Maybe no one.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.811
It could've been unintentional.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.479
It could've just
been an argument.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.747
That got out of hand.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.217
Yeah, a fight, a scuffle, maybe,

19:34.241 --> 19:36.685
in which case that fall woulve
been a complete accident.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.822
Why are you looking at me like that?
You don't...

19:39.846 --> 19:42.006
Come on, you don't think I
had something to do with it.

19:42.030 --> 19:44.966
You know, it wouldn't have taken
a big person to do it, just...

19:45.952 --> 19:47.763
something heavy in the...

19:47.787 --> 19:49.998
- right hands.
- He was your boyfriend, right?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.435
That's right, but
only for a few weeks.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.769
Had you two been arguing?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.272
- That's crazy.
- Did he have any enemies?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.740
Maybe one of your ex-boyfriends?

19:57.764 --> 19:59.475
Maybe one of his ex-girlfriends?

19:59.499 --> 20:00.943
No, but...

20:00.967 --> 20:02.569
- But what?
- Well...

20:04.904 --> 20:07.583
I did think that he might've
been cheating on me.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.586
He was really popular
with the girls.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.854
You know how that is.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.456
Oh, yeah, we know.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.358
So it maybe someone
else's boyfriend?

20:15.382 --> 20:18.861
I can't say. I just don't know.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.264
But I did think that there
might have been someone else.

20:21.288 --> 20:24.733
Gentlemen, I'm sure if Marilyn knew
anything more, she would tell you.

20:24.757 --> 20:25.968
Wouldn't you, dear?

20:25.992 --> 20:28.036
Of course.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.539
Any plans for the holiday?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.332
I'm flying home at noon.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.001
That is, if I'm free to go.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.836
You're free.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.788
She's one of our brightest students,
I'm sure she's telling you the truth.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.690
Maybe.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.425
But is she telling all of it?

20:49.449 --> 20:50.483
Mmm.

20:53.052 --> 20:56.172
For a minute there, I thought they were
going to tell me I couldn't leave town.

20:56.196 --> 20:57.800
That's only in the movies.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.569
They can't actually stop you,
unless they plan to book you.

21:00.593 --> 21:04.039
Yeah, well, you weren't sitting
there in the hot seat like I was.

21:04.063 --> 21:07.009
That's true. You
must've been freaked.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.644
Terrified.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.814
Just a minute.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.350
Hey, the airport shuttle's here.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.419
- I'll call you back later.
- Okay.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.554
And stop worrying.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.279
Right. Bye.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.686
What do you want?

21:48.675 --> 21:49.985
You got a minute?

21:50.009 --> 21:51.987
Sure. What's going on?

21:52.011 --> 21:54.211
It's that case with Olympic,
the blueprint infringement.

21:54.235 --> 21:55.958
I have hit a wall.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.427
How so?

21:58.451 --> 22:01.497
Library of Congress shows no registration
on file for any of Johnson's plans.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.632
- He never registered them?
- Nope.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.334
And...

22:05.346 --> 22:07.627
And we can't file a lawsuit
without a proper registration.

22:07.651 --> 22:08.504
Exactly.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.406
Get an expedited claim going.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.107
I will get all over this.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.433
Hey!

22:14.801 --> 22:17.145
Don't forget about
Wednesday night.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.889
Well, how could I forget?
You dinner parties

22:18.913 --> 22:20.529
are always the talk
at the water cooler.

22:20.553 --> 22:23.919
Oh, and this year, guess
who's flying solo?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.721
Yeah? Becky's out of town?

22:25.745 --> 22:28.391
Mmm-hmm. And that
suits me just fine.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.926
I get to cut loose without her
hovering over my shoulder.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.752
It is going to be so good.
Trust me.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.955
Yeah.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.801
Wonder what that's like.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.803
Cutting loose a little.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.605
You know what it's like?

22:42.629 --> 22:46.108
It's kind of like the difference
between being married...

22:46.132 --> 22:47.600
and only having a girlfriend.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.011
Hey, sleepy head.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.191
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.628
What time is it?

23:06.919 --> 23:09.765
- One?
- Yup.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.000
Guess I was more tired
than I thought.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.737
It's okay, I don't blame you.
There's been so much going on.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.739
I'm so sorry, what
have you been doing?

23:16.763 --> 23:19.608
Me? Oh, uh...

23:19.632 --> 23:22.569
I made breakfast and went to the
corner to pick up a few things.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.039
Oh, no, Mr. Chips got out.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.043
Oh, no.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.820
You must not have re-latched the cage
properly when you cleaned it yesterday.

23:36.844 --> 23:38.994
This happens all the time.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.229
He always comes back,
but what a pain.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.499
It's okay. I'll help you look.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.557
Thank you.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.159
Mr. Chips, where are you?

23:48.227 --> 23:50.473
He's so tiny.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.609
Mmm. But he can cover a lot of
territory when he wants to.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.313
Sooner or later, he'll get hungry
though and that's when we get him.

23:56.337 --> 23:58.947
Ah! Hmm.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.716
Hamster marches on his stomach.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.250
Something like that.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.753
Look, he'll be back. I'm so
sorry I woke up so late.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.480
I'm going to go take a shower and
then we'll go do something fun.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.159
Okay, great. I'll keep looking.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.619
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

25:02.902 --> 25:03.902
Who's that?

25:08.908 --> 25:09.909
Hello?

25:11.711 --> 25:12.712
It's me. Amy.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.958
Oh, Amy.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.216
What do you want?

25:19.151 --> 25:20.519
I just...

25:23.322 --> 25:24.722
I just wanted to use
your hairbrush.

25:26.325 --> 25:29.662
Oh, uh, I just didn't
know who it was.

25:31.598 --> 25:32.765
Who else could it be?

25:33.900 --> 25:35.167
You know what I mean.

25:41.841 --> 25:42.842
Do you mind?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.112
Of course not.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.912
Hello. Benton residence.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.914
Hi, Christine?

26:11.938 --> 26:14.817
No, this is Amy,
Christine's friend.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.384
Oh, hi, Amy.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.177
This is Clare. Is Anna around?

26:20.046 --> 26:23.325
No, not at the moment.
Can I take a message?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.761
I just wanted to confirm our
lunch date for tomorrow.

26:25.785 --> 26:26.886
Noon.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.700
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.532
She asked me to tell you
that something's come

26:33.544 --> 26:35.364
up and she's not going
to be able to make it.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.874
Oh, gosh, okay well,

26:38.898 --> 26:41.367
No big deal. Tell her I'll
catch up with her next week.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.672
I will do just that. Thanks.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.342
Was that the phone?

26:52.745 --> 26:54.723
Oh, yeah. It was Clare.

26:54.747 --> 26:57.059
She told me to tell you
that something's come up,

26:57.083 --> 26:59.403
and she's not going to be able
to make your lunch tomorrow,

26:59.427 --> 27:01.387
but she did say that she
would call you next week.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.569
Oh, what a flake.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.969
So, what are you two
girls doing today?

27:06.993 --> 27:09.261
Uh, I don't know,
just girl stuff.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.375
Hey, do you want a glass?

27:13.399 --> 27:15.034
Kind of takes the
edge off the day.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.781
No, thanks. It's a little early.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.874
Oh, please. People in Italy
have wine at every meal.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.687
Even kids.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.689
Yeah, so I've heard.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.881
But not for me, thank you.

27:30.382 --> 27:31.382
Miss Benton...

27:34.987 --> 27:35.987
are you okay?

27:37.824 --> 27:38.864
Of course, why do you ask?

27:41.460 --> 27:44.272
Look, I know it's none
of my business, but...

27:44.296 --> 27:45.732
but you just seem a
little troubled.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.201
No, not at all.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.773
I mean, maybe I'm a
bit out of sorts.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.920
I am a pre-med student,

27:57.944 --> 28:00.088
and I don't just study medicine.

28:00.112 --> 28:03.049
So, if you want to tell me how
you feel, maybe I could help.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.985
I just need to smile
more, I think.

28:08.921 --> 28:12.467
- Okay, you sure?
- Mmm.

28:12.491 --> 28:16.805
All right. Well, if you do decide that
you want to talk, just say the word.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.241
Yeah, well, don't
you worry about me.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.943
You girls just have fun today.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.211
Okay, I think we're
going to the mall.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.513
Oh, and keep an eye out for Mr.
Chips.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.915
He's on the loose.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.441
- Again?
- Yup. Afraid so.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.249
Such a shame.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.839
It's not, and then this guy, he's like, "Do
you want to dance? Do you want to dance?"

28:50.863 --> 28:52.808
- He keeps asking me, and I say, "No."
- Yeah.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.310
He's like, "Come on,
just one dance."

28:55.334 --> 28:57.880
And so finally I say,
"Okay, okay, let's dance."

28:57.904 --> 28:59.982
- And guess what?
- What?

29:00.006 --> 29:02.017
- He couldn't dance.
- Oh, no!

29:02.041 --> 29:05.087
He could not dance.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.890
I'm not a very good
dancer either, so...

29:07.914 --> 29:09.858
But you're a girl, that's fine.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.962
I mean, with a guy, it's
just that they want to dance

29:11.986 --> 29:14.146
so that they can get up close
and breathe all over you.

29:14.170 --> 29:16.031
Ugh!

29:16.055 --> 29:18.495
I mean, how many guys do you
actually know that like to dance?

29:18.519 --> 29:19.968
Like none.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.004
See Christine, this is
what I'm talking about.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.807
You always have everything
all figured out, don't you?

29:24.831 --> 29:26.441
Absolutely not.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.985
But I do know a thing
or two about men.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.140
And then the...

29:38.177 --> 29:39.278
I've never had a nightie.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.390
I want to get one.

29:42.414 --> 29:45.260
I want to get one
that looks like that

29:45.284 --> 29:48.931
that's sheer and lacy
and a bright color.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.833
Listen to you.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.100
What?

29:52.124 --> 29:53.225
Who would you model it for?

29:55.094 --> 29:56.228
Nobody, I guess.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.143
I'd just like to have one.

30:01.167 --> 30:04.112
See that's the problem
with lingerie.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.804
Nobody ever gets
to see it but you.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.977
True, but...

30:12.344 --> 30:14.413
my grandma did send
me some mad money.

30:15.948 --> 30:16.948
So...

30:17.984 --> 30:19.118
why not go mad?

30:21.520 --> 30:22.965
Why not indeed?

30:22.989 --> 30:24.423
- Really?
- Sure.

31:33.659 --> 31:34.659
Can't sleep?

31:35.727 --> 31:38.373
Oh, you startled me.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.176
Maybe I should make
more noise, huh?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.711
No, it's fine. I just wasn't
expecting to run into anyone.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.115
I was just a little bit
restless tonight, that's all.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.340
Funny. Me, too.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.543
Care to join me?

31:53.412 --> 31:54.981
Maybe just a wee dram.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.988
Where's Christine?

32:04.223 --> 32:06.943
How come every time we're alone
together, you ask me about Christine?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.206
Do I?

32:11.230 --> 32:12.350
Do I make you uncomfortable?

32:13.732 --> 32:14.732
Don't be silly.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.270
Then how come you won't
even look at me?

32:28.314 --> 32:29.315
Do you like this?

32:30.549 --> 32:31.629
I got it at the mall today.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.086
It's very pretty.

32:36.022 --> 32:37.022
I like the color.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.090
It suits you.

32:41.127 --> 32:44.663
Did you know that they say color
can affect a person's mood?

32:46.765 --> 32:47.765
I've heard that.

32:51.703 --> 32:52.703
So what about this color?

32:54.273 --> 32:55.541
Does it make you feel anything?

32:58.044 --> 32:59.521
Maybe you should put a robe on.

32:59.545 --> 33:02.790
It's supposed to get down
in the upper 30s tonight.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.317
Oh, who cares? I'm inside.
It's nice and toasty in here.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.414
Oh, and to answer your
question about Christine...

33:11.190 --> 33:12.190
she's asleep.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.225
Anna?

33:21.533 --> 33:23.335
Then I guess it's just
us two night owls.

33:32.411 --> 33:33.512
See you tomorrow.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.082
See you tomorrow.

35:05.537 --> 35:08.316
Mrs. Benton.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.786
Good morning, Amy. You're just in time.
Breakfast is almost ready.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.412
Charles, breakfast!

35:15.914 --> 35:18.560
Wow! Look at you.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.152
Yeah. Coffee's on
if you want some.

35:23.189 --> 35:24.466
What a pleasant surprise.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.868
I thought I'd get an
early start on the day.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.237
Go sit.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.501
Um, Amy, why don't you have a seat?
I'll fix you a plate.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.842
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.026
Well, could you tell Christine
that breakfast is ready?

35:37.769 --> 35:38.769
Sure.

35:40.872 --> 35:43.185
This is great, honey.
What's the occasion?

35:43.209 --> 35:44.852
Mmm, no occasion.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.036
I'm just, you know, trying
to be the woman you married.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.657
You already are.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.227
No, I haven't been
that woman in a while.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.752
But I can be, and I will be.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.931
Don't even think about it.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.701
Everybody gets side-tracked
once in a while.

35:59.725 --> 36:02.504
I want to get that spark
back, that we used to have.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.088
I'm going to start
doing that right now.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.309
I'd love to help you.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.944
Come quick! There's something
wrong with Christine.

36:09.968 --> 36:12.504
- Christine?
- She's real sick. She wants you.

36:16.442 --> 36:17.709
Real sick.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.361
Oh, baby, what's the matter?

36:26.385 --> 36:27.995
Christine, what's wrong?

36:28.019 --> 36:31.999
Mom, I think it's just a cold.
A really bad one.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.270
Why, I feel awful!
My head is pounding,

36:35.294 --> 36:36.904
and I can barely breathe.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.968
Amy said you'd been burning
the candle at both ends.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.808
This is what happens.

36:42.468 --> 36:43.828
Stop trying to make
me feel better.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.650
No, no, no. You stay right
where you are, young lady.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.685
You are not leaving
this bed today.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.787
What am I supposed to do?

36:52.811 --> 36:55.590
You need your rest. You need
to let this run its course.

36:55.614 --> 36:56.891
You're not going anywhere.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.361
What? Now you're the expert.

36:59.385 --> 37:02.264
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

37:02.288 --> 37:04.008
Now I'm going to get you
something to drink.

37:04.032 --> 37:05.032
You gotta stay hydrated.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.522
Oh! Feel better, princess.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.348
I'll call you later to
see how you're doing.

38:06.751 --> 38:09.431
Okay, I'm going to run to the drug
store and pick up some cold meds.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.699
Maybe those will help.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.536
Mom, I'm so sorry.
I feel so bad.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.004
I know you had that dinner
party to get ready for.

38:17.028 --> 38:19.774
No! No! Don't even
think about it.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.600
I'm sure Amy can help
out if I need it.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.447
Yes, of course, I can.

38:25.471 --> 38:28.350
I'd be happy to help out.
Here, now drink this.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.475
Oh, God.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.760
Now one of you please
help me to the bathroom.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.862
- Yeah, sure.
- I got this.

38:40.886 --> 38:42.797
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.623
I guess I'll run to the store.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.571
Oh, make sure you get
some decongestant...

38:49.595 --> 38:51.806
and a thermometer. I
couldn't find one.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.870
I think I can handle this.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.612
All right, after you're done,
it is straight to bed.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.538
Yes, doctor.

39:13.852 --> 39:14.986
I'm ready.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.561
Aw!

39:23.795 --> 39:24.795
Okay.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.643
Now you stay put...

39:28.667 --> 39:31.145
and I will be back again
soon to check on you.

39:31.169 --> 39:33.047
I think you're such
a good friend, Amy,

39:33.071 --> 39:35.016
I honestly don't know
what I'd do without you.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.485
Just take it easy.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.721
Your mom's going to be home soon and
you won't even need me around anymore.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.088
Don't say that, please.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.614
Come on. I want you around.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.518
Well, then I'm not
going anywhere.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.662
This way, guys, go
on right over here.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.979
Hey!

40:05.003 --> 40:06.914
I just got your message.
Is she...

40:06.938 --> 40:08.883
Yeah, she is.

40:08.907 --> 40:12.219
Airport shuttle driver said there
was no answer at the door,

40:12.243 --> 40:15.557
and then her folks phoned it in
when they couldn't reach her.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.059
Yeah, well, you're
going to love this.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.562
- What's this?
- Toxicology report from that kid.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.063
It's about time.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.998
Let me guess, alcohol, right?

40:24.022 --> 40:27.569
Nope. Something
better is in there.

40:27.593 --> 40:30.972
"Sodium diethylbarbiturate"?
What the hell is that, Joe?

40:30.996 --> 40:32.774
It's a sleeping powder.

40:32.798 --> 40:36.578
Odorless, tasteless,
classified as a hypnotic.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.813
It's powerful stuff.
Knocks you out in minutes.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.673
And get this, has not been
used since the 1950s.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.854
Tell me, how would somebody
get a hold of that today?

40:46.878 --> 40:48.756
You can make it...

40:48.780 --> 40:50.958
if you have a chemistry lab.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.595
You mean, like the chemistry
lab here on campus.

40:53.619 --> 40:54.886
That's what I'm thinking.

40:57.623 --> 40:58.957
You figure it was used on her?

41:00.091 --> 41:02.761
I guess we'll see.

41:06.031 --> 41:10.011
Only three students have a key
to the chemistry department.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.604
Connolly, Williams, and Thomas.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.083
Thomas. Amy Thomas?

41:16.107 --> 41:19.220
That's right. A promising
pre-med student.

41:19.244 --> 41:22.023
She absolutely
excels at chemistry.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.559
We already talked to her.
What about the other two?

41:24.583 --> 41:27.294
Once again, both
excellent students.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.697
All volunteer as
teacher's aides.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.799
Can we get their contact info?

41:31.823 --> 41:34.793
Of course. But these other two
students, they've already left town.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.562
I wouldn't bet on it.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.262
Hello?

42:01.286 --> 42:03.246
Can I speak to Christine
Roberts, please?

42:05.190 --> 42:07.769
Yes, this is Christine.

42:07.793 --> 42:11.196
Christine, this is Detective Parker,
we met at the college the other night.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.709
Yes, I remember.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.573
Well, I'm calling about
your friend Amy Thomas.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.282
Amy, what about her?

42:21.306 --> 42:24.106
Well, I was told that she maybe staying
with you for the holiday break.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.121
Yeah, she was.

42:27.145 --> 42:29.123
Was?

42:29.147 --> 42:31.358
She's not there now?

42:31.382 --> 42:33.151
No, she left, yesterday.

42:35.220 --> 42:36.764
Left.

42:36.788 --> 42:37.856
Any idea where she went?

42:40.258 --> 42:43.838
I'm not sure. I think that she went
to spend time with her family.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.063
They're in Europe.

42:46.865 --> 42:48.700
Again, she didn't
say anything else?

42:50.669 --> 42:51.803
No, that's all, Detective.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.306
She can be a little
secretive sometimes.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.568
Yeah, we're just starting to
figure that out ourselves.

43:00.946 --> 43:02.047
Thank you.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.182
No problem.

43:15.393 --> 43:16.995
There you are, buddy.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.602
Mr. Chips.

43:28.173 --> 43:30.175
Come on, buddy. Don't run away.

43:40.085 --> 43:41.428
Come here, buddy.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.054
Where are you?

43:54.065 --> 43:55.233
Come here, buddy.

44:06.311 --> 44:08.013
Hi, Mr. Chips.

44:22.260 --> 44:24.062
There.

44:26.965 --> 44:28.133
All better.

44:47.152 --> 44:49.396
Amy?

44:49.420 --> 44:52.734
I'm in here, Mrs. Benton.

44:52.758 --> 44:55.158
I told you, you can stop calling me "Mrs.
Benton." It's Anna.

44:55.182 --> 44:58.285
I know. I know. I'll do better
in the future. I promise.

44:59.931 --> 45:02.043
What's going on?

45:02.067 --> 45:04.211
Uh, nothing.
Christine is asleep,

45:04.235 --> 45:06.213
so I just thought
I'd clean up a bit.

45:06.237 --> 45:08.750
No one wants to come
home to a messy kitchen.

45:08.774 --> 45:11.418
That's so unexpected.

45:11.442 --> 45:13.011
You really are too
good to be true.

45:14.913 --> 45:16.457
I spilled cranberry juice.

45:16.481 --> 45:18.760
You don't want a sticky floor.

45:18.784 --> 45:22.396
No, you don't, but I
could've done that.

45:22.420 --> 45:26.024
No, I always clean up my messes...
Anna.

45:27.959 --> 45:30.805
I'm going to go
check on Christine.

45:30.829 --> 45:33.965
Okay. I will be in in a second,
just when I finish up.

45:52.317 --> 45:55.320
Christine. Honey, you awake?

45:57.022 --> 45:58.223
You awake?

46:00.125 --> 46:01.359
Christine?

46:04.562 --> 46:05.831
Honey?

46:06.965 --> 46:09.034
Honey? Christine?

46:11.569 --> 46:13.004
Christine?

46:30.255 --> 46:33.134
So how many people are you having for
this dinner party tomorrow night?

46:33.158 --> 46:36.537
Um, just two other couples. So with you
and Christine, that makes eight of us.

46:36.561 --> 46:37.996
Oh, great.

46:39.931 --> 46:43.077
You know, I used to braise short
ribs with my mom as a kid.

46:43.101 --> 46:47.114
I loved it. The house would just
fill up with the most amazing aroma,

46:47.138 --> 46:49.550
and just float around for days.

46:49.574 --> 46:54.221
Sometimes... Sometimes, it was
like I could almost taste the air.

46:54.245 --> 46:57.358
Oh, the trick is to prepare
everything a day in advance.

46:57.382 --> 47:03.330
It's such a shame to waste a perfectly
good bottle of wine on raw meat, right?

47:03.354 --> 47:06.000
Well, we're only going
to use half a bottle.

47:06.024 --> 47:09.303
Oh! Well, great.
Then more for us.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.129
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

47:16.267 --> 47:18.946
Do you not like wine?

47:18.970 --> 47:21.048
Uh, I... I don't drink.

47:21.072 --> 47:22.407
I haven't for sometime.

47:24.409 --> 47:26.620
Oh. Why is that?

47:26.644 --> 47:29.380
Is it because it causes
problems for you and Charles?

47:31.482 --> 47:32.918
That's kind of personal, Amy.

47:34.319 --> 47:36.163
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

47:36.187 --> 47:38.056
I didn't mean to imply anything.
I just...

47:40.058 --> 47:42.369
I have this thing where I say
whatever pops into my head,

47:42.393 --> 47:45.106
and sometimes it's
the wrong thing.

47:45.130 --> 47:47.641
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

47:47.665 --> 47:49.676
And Charles and I don't
have any problems.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.612
We're fine.

47:51.636 --> 47:54.648
Oh. Well, that's good to hear.

47:54.672 --> 47:57.151
Yeah, it takes work,

47:57.175 --> 47:59.453
but I'm up to it.

47:59.477 --> 48:01.212
We are going to need
the Dutch oven.

48:04.282 --> 48:05.659
Okay, where is it?

48:05.683 --> 48:07.995
Ugh, it's up here. Charles
put all the big pots

48:08.019 --> 48:09.931
out of the way, so we'd have
more room in the kitchen.

48:09.955 --> 48:11.665
Oh, you know, I would
help you with that,

48:11.689 --> 48:13.467
but I'm a little
afraid of heights.

48:13.491 --> 48:17.071
No, that's okay. I think
I can reach it. Here.

48:17.095 --> 48:19.040
- Just help me. Thanks.
- Yeah.

48:19.064 --> 48:21.675
Okay. I think I can
reach the lid.

48:21.699 --> 48:23.410
Okay, just hand it down to me.

48:23.434 --> 48:26.147
Yeah, it's heavy.

48:26.171 --> 48:27.548
Okay, here.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.316
Got it.

48:29.340 --> 48:32.353
Uh! Oh, almost got this.

48:32.377 --> 48:33.544
Hold on.

48:36.214 --> 48:38.116
Almost got it. Almost got...

48:45.290 --> 48:47.668
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

48:47.692 --> 48:49.570
What happened?

48:49.594 --> 48:52.639
Oh, my God, the chair... you
were leaning too far forward,

48:52.663 --> 48:54.275
and it just flipped
right from under you.

48:54.299 --> 48:55.442
Are you hurt?

48:55.466 --> 48:57.979
My leg. I think I
might've broken it.

48:58.003 --> 49:00.314
And my back really hurts.

49:00.338 --> 49:03.538
Okay, don't move. It can make things worse,
all right? I know exactly what to do.

49:03.562 --> 49:05.722
You're going to be fine. I
can take care of everything.

49:09.047 --> 49:10.992
Well, it all just
happened so fast.

49:11.016 --> 49:13.777
One minute she was on the chair, the
next minute she was on the floor.

49:13.801 --> 49:15.429
How bad is it?

49:15.453 --> 49:18.032
Well, they say she broke
her tibia and her fibula.

49:18.056 --> 49:21.068
She also tweaked her back,
but that's not as serious.

49:21.092 --> 49:22.736
Look, I can be there
in about 30 minutes.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.771
Oh, no, no, don't.

49:24.795 --> 49:28.575
Don't do that. She's ready to go
home now and I've got the car.

49:28.599 --> 49:31.012
I'm just waiting on them
to fill her prescriptions.

49:31.036 --> 49:33.147
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

49:33.171 --> 49:35.411
You've got important things to do.
Just leave this to me.

49:35.435 --> 49:37.604
All right. Tell her
I'll be home early.

49:39.110 --> 49:41.455
I'll see you at the house.
And Charles...

49:41.479 --> 49:43.624
don't worry, okay?

49:43.648 --> 49:47.261
This is just a little setback. It's
nothing life-threatening or anything.

49:47.285 --> 49:48.629
She's in good hands.

49:48.653 --> 49:50.293
Amy, I don't know how
to thank you enough.

49:51.456 --> 49:52.490
I'll see you at home.

49:58.063 --> 50:02.176
So the doctors say that your mom should
just stay in bed the next few days,

50:02.200 --> 50:04.640
and she should put as little
pressure on that leg as possible.

50:05.803 --> 50:07.448
How's the soup? Is it too hot?

50:07.472 --> 50:09.107
Oh, it's great. Thank you.

50:12.410 --> 50:14.512
Man, whatever you
got, you got it good.

50:15.713 --> 50:17.358
And now your poor mom.

50:17.382 --> 50:20.061
Some vacation for you.

50:20.085 --> 50:23.088
Stop. Really, I'm just glad I
could be here to help out.

50:25.423 --> 50:28.023
Could you imagine Charles trying
to handle both of you on his own?

50:29.527 --> 50:30.595
No.

50:31.762 --> 50:33.374
Are you done with that?

50:33.398 --> 50:36.377
Thank you. Yeah.

50:36.401 --> 50:38.279
I'm just getting really tired.

50:38.303 --> 50:40.238
Okay. Well, I'll
keep quiet for you.

50:41.406 --> 50:43.317
Still no sign of Mr. Chips?

50:43.341 --> 50:45.219
No.

50:45.243 --> 50:47.554
But maybe he just finally
escaped to greener pastures.

50:47.578 --> 50:50.724
I really hope he
didn't get outside.

50:50.748 --> 50:52.093
It's going to be
freezing tonight.

50:52.117 --> 50:54.319
Again? Really?

50:56.721 --> 50:58.589
Well, get some rest.

51:22.847 --> 51:24.291
Charles.

51:24.315 --> 51:25.350
Hi.

51:27.885 --> 51:29.330
You taking visitors?

51:29.354 --> 51:30.455
What an idiot I am.

51:32.823 --> 51:34.635
What kind of talk is that?

51:34.659 --> 51:36.703
I should've known better.

51:36.727 --> 51:40.141
All I had to do was go into the
garage and get a step ladder, but no,

51:40.165 --> 51:42.709
not me!

51:42.733 --> 51:44.478
You should've let
Amy climb up there.

51:44.502 --> 51:46.680
Yeah, she said she was
afraid of heights.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.815
Really? Afraid of heights?

51:48.839 --> 51:51.176
Well, what difference does it make?
What's done is done.

51:52.810 --> 51:54.588
Does it hurt?

51:54.612 --> 51:56.690
It might when these
drugs wear off.

51:56.714 --> 51:58.859
Then we'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

51:58.883 --> 52:00.927
They're the good ones.
You want some?

52:00.951 --> 52:03.397
No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

52:03.421 --> 52:04.798
Too bad.

52:04.822 --> 52:06.324
Could've had a party.

52:07.392 --> 52:08.526
Maybe later.

52:10.428 --> 52:12.406
I'll be back.

52:12.430 --> 52:13.698
I'll wait right here.

52:39.957 --> 52:42.303
Thought you said you were
going to be home early.

52:42.327 --> 52:45.930
Oh, hey, I got caught on a conference
call with Washington that took forever.

52:47.798 --> 52:49.518
I'm sorry I wasn't home
earlier to help out.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.579
Don't apologize to me.

52:52.603 --> 52:53.914
I'm nobody.

52:53.938 --> 52:55.773
Don't say that.

52:59.510 --> 53:02.513
Here. Thought you could use
this after a day like today.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.450
There you go, spoiling me again.

53:07.752 --> 53:08.786
Where's yours?

53:20.931 --> 53:23.244
What smells so good?

53:23.268 --> 53:25.628
It's wine-braised beef for your
dinner party tomorrow night.

53:28.339 --> 53:30.317
I have to cancel that.

53:30.341 --> 53:31.918
Why would you do that?

53:31.942 --> 53:34.855
Anna has worked so hard to
put everything together.

53:34.879 --> 53:37.624
It would kill her.

53:37.648 --> 53:41.428
Besides, I can stage the entire
dinner party and play hostess.

53:41.452 --> 53:43.564
Mmm, I don't know about that.

53:43.588 --> 53:46.900
Look, hard part's already done.

53:46.924 --> 53:49.494
Please, let me help
you with this.

53:51.396 --> 53:52.863
It is a huge client.

53:54.765 --> 53:56.334
Anna did want this to happen.

53:57.635 --> 53:58.769
Then it's done.

54:03.007 --> 54:04.751
Get this to Anna.

54:04.775 --> 54:07.053
How's you manage to get
the Dutch oven down?

54:07.077 --> 54:09.290
Oh, it was no big deal.

54:09.314 --> 54:12.517
I just... climbed
up and grabbed it.

54:14.952 --> 54:17.152
If Anna would have let me help
her in the first place...

54:18.756 --> 54:20.316
then it never would
have been a problem.

54:27.064 --> 54:30.744
Why are you dressed like...

54:30.768 --> 54:32.303
that?

54:34.439 --> 54:35.439
Dressed like what?

54:40.411 --> 54:41.579
Like that?

54:45.516 --> 54:46.756
All my clothes are in the wash.

54:48.953 --> 54:51.288
But if this shirt bothers
you, I can take it off.

54:53.558 --> 54:54.659
Just say the word.

56:33.157 --> 56:35.192
- Morning.
- Morning.

56:39.063 --> 56:40.097
Sleep well?

56:41.198 --> 56:42.198
Hardly.

56:44.502 --> 56:46.046
Breakfast is almost ready.

56:46.070 --> 56:47.738
Um, already running late.

56:54.679 --> 56:55.946
But you're the boss.

56:59.717 --> 57:00.997
You can go in whenever you want.

57:05.590 --> 57:06.633
Hey.

57:06.657 --> 57:07.725
I gotta go.

57:31.716 --> 57:33.594
Here you go.

57:33.618 --> 57:35.796
Thanks, hon.

57:35.820 --> 57:37.664
I wish you didn't
have to go in today.

57:37.688 --> 57:39.766
I know.

57:39.790 --> 57:42.235
But you have Amy
around to help you.

57:42.259 --> 57:47.273
Yeah, that's just it, I feel so
helpless lying here while some...

57:47.297 --> 57:50.010
strange girl runs my house.

57:50.034 --> 57:52.178
We're lucky to have her here.

57:52.202 --> 57:54.615
I just checked in on Christine.

57:54.639 --> 57:57.117
She's doing worse today
than she was yesterday.

57:57.141 --> 57:59.610
I know, and I'm worried.

58:00.778 --> 58:02.589
I'm scared.

58:02.613 --> 58:03.990
Scared of what?

58:04.014 --> 58:05.826
Of her.

58:05.850 --> 58:08.729
Of Amy? Please.

58:08.753 --> 58:11.565
No, I mean it. Look at what's
happened since she got here.

58:11.589 --> 58:14.167
Christine got seriously
ill within a day

58:14.191 --> 58:17.170
and is getting worse by the minute.
Why?

58:17.194 --> 58:20.006
And she didn't like Mr. Chips
and now he's disappeared.

58:20.030 --> 58:23.043
I accidentally fall and
break my leg in two places

58:23.067 --> 58:26.179
and all of this after some boy
that Christine used to date

58:26.203 --> 58:28.915
accidentally falls to his death.

58:28.939 --> 58:31.818
How could she have anything to
do with these things? And why?

58:31.842 --> 58:34.087
Because Charles, she wants you.

58:34.111 --> 58:36.289
I see how she's constantly
looking at you.

58:36.313 --> 58:38.158
She needs me and Christine
out of the way.

58:38.182 --> 58:40.694
And I'm scared.

58:40.718 --> 58:43.038
I think maybe you're just being
a little bit jealous, Anna.

58:43.988 --> 58:45.966
She's just a kid.

58:45.990 --> 58:47.157
Why are you protecting her?

58:49.026 --> 58:51.071
You see that tea cup?

58:51.095 --> 58:55.842
I don't remember anything after I
drank that last night. Not anything.

58:55.866 --> 58:59.345
And there's something at the bottom,
like undissolved sugar or something.

58:59.369 --> 59:00.705
Look.

59:03.808 --> 59:05.151
I don't see anything.

59:05.175 --> 59:06.720
No, it's there.

59:06.744 --> 59:08.913
You have to look hard,
but it's there.

59:12.216 --> 59:14.127
Maybe it is sugar.

59:14.151 --> 59:16.329
I don't use sugar
in my tea, Charles.

59:16.353 --> 59:18.055
She put something in it.

59:19.690 --> 59:21.134
What do you want me to do?

59:21.158 --> 59:23.670
I want you to get her out
of this house right now.

59:23.694 --> 59:25.171
I can't just throw her out.

59:25.195 --> 59:26.755
No, no, you don't have
to throw her out.

59:26.779 --> 59:28.141
Just make up some excuse.

59:28.165 --> 59:30.644
Just drive her back to her dorm.

59:30.668 --> 59:33.947
Please, do it.
Charles, do it for me.

59:33.971 --> 59:36.750
Do what?

59:36.774 --> 59:39.820
If it's an errand you need to
run, I'd be happy to help out.

59:39.844 --> 59:42.055
No. I can handle it.

59:42.079 --> 59:43.714
All right.

59:46.250 --> 59:47.985
Oh, silly me.

59:49.754 --> 59:50.994
I forgot to come back for this.

59:52.122 --> 59:53.290
Sorry.

59:58.195 --> 59:59.730
Well, let me know if
you need anything.

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:08.906
Yes?

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.652
Yes.

01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:13.010
Thank you, Charles.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:20.350
I'll see you later.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:25.622
Take care of that leg.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:43.283
I'll be home early to
help with the dinner.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.719
Don't worry about a thing.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:46.943
I've got it all under control.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.756
Christine, I'm starting
to worry about your mom.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.793
Why?

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.372
Look, I know it's
none of my business,

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:42.132
but I think she
might be depressed.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.980
I'd be depressed, too,
if I were her right now.

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:49.749
True, but she has this
small pharmacy's worth

01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:52.518
of painkillers on her
nightstand right now.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.422
And I think she might be
overmedicating herself.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:57.815
I know she wouldn't do that.

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:02.395
Look, Christine...

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:04.530
Your mom told me about her
trouble with alcohol.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.000
I know all about it.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:10.336
And now with the
accident, I'm worried.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.273
You know, some people have
addictive personalities.

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:16.276
Christine, and they just
can't help themselves.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.002
Trust me, I know what
I'm talking about.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:21.815
I know, she's going to be okay.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:23.173
I know my mom. She...

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:25.876
She's stronger
than people think.

01:02:27.044 --> 01:02:28.745
Whatever you say.

01:02:33.017 --> 01:02:36.029
I just...

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:37.998
If she were to ever to overdose,

01:02:38.022 --> 01:02:40.582
I would never be able to forgive
myself for not saying something.

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:42.645
So I just thought
you should know.

01:02:44.028 --> 01:02:45.996
I mean, thank you
for caring, but...

01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:48.765
you don't need to worry.

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:20.197
Zip me up?

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:32.142
Where did you get this?

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:39.225
Oh, I got it from Anna's closet.

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.561
She was asleep, otherwise
I would've asked her.

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:44.145
But I'm sure she won't mind. I
have to look good for your guests.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.985
Do you like it?

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:06.543
You look great.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:15.585
Don't be like that. Hey.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:19.123
You know, people
will be here soon.

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.030
I did all this for you.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:31.377
Oh, well, you know,
that will be Ken,

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:33.479
my junior partner.

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:35.172
Oh, I'll get it.

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:39.476
I need to finish
getting dressed.

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.166
Come on in.

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.625
- I'm early.
- Oh, it's no problem.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.439
I'm Ken. I work with Charles.

01:04:59.463 --> 01:05:01.607
Yes, I know who you are.

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.511
I brought a little something
for the party here.

01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:05.345
Oh, excellent. Thank you.

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:07.613
You didn't have to do that.
That's so sweet.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.950
So tell me, where have
they been hiding you?

01:05:09.974 --> 01:05:11.375
I'm a friend of Christine's.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.255
- So is she still laid up here?
- Yes.

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:18.524
She is. It's awful, and Mrs.
Benton.

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:20.548
That's why I offered to
help host the dinner party,

01:05:20.572 --> 01:05:22.262
so Charles didn't
have to cancel.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:24.188
Well, you certainly
are easy on the eyes.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:29.302
Your name wouldn't happen
to be Amy, would it?

01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:32.572
Yes, it is. Why has somebody
been talking about me?

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:35.475
Well, as a matter of fact, just as
Charles was leaving the office today.

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:37.410
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:40.080
A police detective
called named Parker.

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:43.416
Asked if there was an Amy
staying at the Benton house.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.352
Wow, a detective. What
did you tell him?

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.388
I told him the truth,

01:05:48.412 --> 01:05:50.414
that I had never heard
of anyone named Amy.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.617
But boy, oh, boy, have I now!

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:56.529
Yes, you have.

01:05:56.553 --> 01:06:00.066
So, Amy, are you on someone's
top 10 most wanted list?

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.368
Hardly. No, uh...

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.604
actually, there was an
accident at my school.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.948
It was pretty serious and I
gave the detective a statement,

01:06:06.972 --> 01:06:08.774
so he's probably just
calling to follow up.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.211
I should give him
a call tomorrow.

01:06:11.235 --> 01:06:14.480
But, more importantly, can
I shake you up a cocktail?

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:19.419
You seem to me like you
are a vodka martini guy?

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:22.722
Straight up, no vermouth,
olives on the side.

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:26.126
Amy, I might be falling
in love with you.

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.285
Well, Ken, that's what
all the boys say.

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:34.734
And that gentlemen, is the growing
problem with digital content delivery.

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:36.702
It's just too
difficult to protect.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:39.505
If not, ultimately impossible.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:42.308
That's why the new system
needs to be put in place.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.644
A file list of managed works.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:47.480
Make the webmasters accountable
for their own actions.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:51.317
Mmm-hmm. Now we have had success
with Sycho-vue last year

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:54.102
and we've covered all the revenue
generated by an illegal distribution

01:06:54.126 --> 01:06:55.255
up until that point.

01:06:55.279 --> 01:06:58.258
Well, that is exactly
what I wanted to hear.

01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:01.827
Well, I can work up a proposal if you'd
like, have it ready for you by next week.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.753
Great. That should
work out just fine.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:09.702
So, anybody have plans
for the holiday?

01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:12.538
I am headed to San Luis
for the rest of the week.

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:15.375
Oh, the water is
beautiful up there.

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:17.577
- When do you leave?
- Mmm.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:20.646
Tonight. I've got a bag packed and I'm
outta here as soon as dinner is over.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.715
I don't know how I'll
get along without you.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.418
Well, I am sorry,
Charles, but...

01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:26.543
I can't help you there.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:31.091
- You're gonna have a great time.
- Thank you.

01:07:31.115 --> 01:07:33.326
And I will be here...

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.329
just taking care of everybody.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.764
Amy, you're a perfect angel.

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:41.234
And you've done a wonderful
job with the dinner.

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:43.227
Yes, it was expertly cooked.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.139
Well, I tried.

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:47.564
You succeeded.

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:57.317
I don't know how I'd
get along without you.

01:07:57.341 --> 01:08:00.220
Yes. Excellent. That's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

01:08:00.244 --> 01:08:03.356
And I will be here...

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:04.481
taking care of everybody.

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:13.590
What a lovely evening.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.638
I can't thank you both enough
for coming to my home.

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:20.305
Oh, thank you so much.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.707
It was a pleasure.

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:23.676
A pleasure, Brian.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.877
- Drive safely.
- Thank you very much. Good night.

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:27.636
Thank you. Good night.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.578
Well, I think we
nailed that one.

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:37.323
I think we did.

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:38.548
You guys can thank me later.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:44.464
Ooh. She is quite a find.

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.631
You my friend, are very lucky.

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:48.600
Why do you say that?

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.371
She's got a lot
going on for her,

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:53.274
and plus the wrapper ain't
half bad, am I right?

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.442
Don't you have a
long drive ahead?

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.469
Yeah. Yeah, I should
hit the road.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.883
Hey, about Amy...

01:09:03.907 --> 01:09:05.442
Yeah?

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.511
Never mind.

01:09:21.425 --> 01:09:22.426
Unzip me?

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:39.615
You can keep going if you want.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:44.881
I'm pretty tired tonight.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:48.618
So that's the way it is?

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.522
That's the way it is.

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:07.737
Honey.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:11.974
Honey.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.310
Oh, honey.

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:57.754
Come on. Come on.

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.970
I'm okay. All right.

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.430
Come on! Come on.

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:49.715
Morning. Have a seat.
It's almost ready.

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:51.741
We need to talk.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.780
All right.

01:12:00.717 --> 01:12:02.819
Okay, let's talk. What do
you want to talk about?

01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:05.541
I'm worried about Christine.

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:07.883
She's not getting any better.

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:12.438
With Anna out of commission,

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:16.075
I think, it's time that...

01:12:16.099 --> 01:12:18.644
I brought in some
professional help.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:19.669
Professional help?

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:24.517
What are you trying to say?

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:26.342
What I'm trying to say is...

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:31.424
we all appreciate everything
you've done here,

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:32.916
especially me...

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:37.921
but I need to hire
a live-in nurse.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:41.658
She's going to need
the guest room.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.739
You're throwing me out?

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:48.532
After everything that
I've done for you?

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.535
After everything
that we've shared?

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:55.681
I mean, we had...

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:58.150
we had something going here.

01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:01.454
No, we never had
anything going here.

01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:03.122
That was a mistake,
and a big one.

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.157
No, that's not true.

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:06.983
Don't say that. That's not true.

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:09.786
Well, I realize that...

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:12.456
now.

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:17.494
I really love my wife.

01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:25.445
I really need you to leave.
I'll drive you back to campus.

01:13:25.469 --> 01:13:27.212
Oh, no.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.081
No, you don't have to...

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:32.084
you don't have to
drive me anywhere.

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:35.555
You don't want me around? Fine.

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.957
Fine. Then I'll leave on my own.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.959
I have my own friends,

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:42.462
and I can get my own damn ride.

01:13:42.486 --> 01:13:44.246
I'm sorry about this,
but it is for the best.

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.600
Oh, is it?

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:50.703
Is it? Is it for the best?

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:54.774
What do you know about
"for the best," hmm?

01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:57.767
I'm the best thing that
ever happened to you!

01:13:59.803 --> 01:14:03.483
Better than that lazy
step-daughter of yours.

01:14:03.507 --> 01:14:06.519
And I'm sure as hell a lot
better than that pathetic excuse

01:14:06.543 --> 01:14:08.821
of a wife that you have
laying in there right now.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:11.657
And you know it.

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:12.716
You know it.

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:16.986
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:21.124
My mind is made up.

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.597
Fine.

01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:29.832
Fine.

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:34.089
Then I won't be here
when you get back.

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:37.983
'Cause I don't want to ruin...

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.809
or get in the way
of your happiness.

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:42.546
Thank you.

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:09.248
Good morning, sunshine.

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:10.983
Morning.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.586
How'd your dinner go?

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:14.911
Dinner?

01:15:16.312 --> 01:15:19.324
Uh, dinner went fine, thanks.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.694
You got visitors.

01:15:21.718 --> 01:15:23.829
- What?
- In your office.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.121
It looks very official.

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:40.312
Can I help you?

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:43.683
Detective Ed Parker, this
is my partner Joe Davis.

01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:45.150
Police, is there a problem?

01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:46.934
Do you know a girl by
the name of Amy Thomas?

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.690
Yes.

01:15:50.714 --> 01:15:53.626
She's a friend of my
step-daughter Christine.

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:56.228
Well, do you know
where she is now?

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.212
She's been staying at our
house the last few days.

01:15:59.856 --> 01:16:02.167
And how's that been going?

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:03.627
Tough.

01:16:06.362 --> 01:16:08.841
Christine became
sick immediately,

01:16:08.865 --> 01:16:11.945
and she's been bed-ridden ever since and
Amy was taking care of her when my...

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.348
wife had an accident.

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:17.641
What kind of accident?

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:21.053
She took a bad fall.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.988
Broke her leg.

01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:24.614
We'd like to talk
to Miss Thomas.

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:27.727
You might be too late.

01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:29.152
I told her this
morning to get out.

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:35.725
Let's go.

01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:46.970
I'm sorry I can't stick around
to help you feel better.

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:50.705
There's nothing that
would've made me happier.

01:16:53.977 --> 01:16:55.679
But I guess everybody's
done with me now.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.652
It's sad.

01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:05.789
It's tragic, really.

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:11.036
I give and I give and I give,

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.931
but I just can't seem to find what
it is that I'm searching for.

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.935
People can be so shallow.

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:22.806
They don't know what love is.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.842
But I do.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:28.878
I know what love is.

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:32.248
And I deserve it.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:37.954
I just can't seem to find it.

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:42.325
In a moment...

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:46.830
that leg won't be hurting
you at all anymore.

01:17:48.732 --> 01:17:49.933
You won't feel any pain.

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:54.003
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:58.383
I know I would.

01:17:58.407 --> 01:17:59.919
Amy!

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:03.847
I'll be right back.

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:08.151
Amy!

01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:24.834
Christine, what is it?
You called for me?

01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:27.136
I had a really bad dream.

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:30.349
Aw.

01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:32.041
I really want to see my mom.

01:18:35.879 --> 01:18:38.599
Well, your step-dad thinks that
you've already suffered enough, so...

01:18:38.623 --> 01:18:40.325
it's time to take
you to the doctor.

01:18:40.349 --> 01:18:41.994
- Really?
- Yup.

01:18:42.018 --> 01:18:44.263
Come on, Scout's honor.

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:46.498
- Come on.
- Can you help me get dressed?

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:48.333
No, there's no time for that.

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:49.969
We're already running late.

01:18:49.993 --> 01:18:51.713
I can't go like this. I
need to get dressed.

01:18:51.737 --> 01:18:54.406
- No.
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:57.943
- Christine, it has to be this way.
- Let go of me! Let go!

01:18:57.967 --> 01:18:59.378
Christine, let's go!

01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:01.213
It has to be this way!

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:02.514
Go!

01:19:02.538 --> 01:19:04.349
Leave me alone!

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:05.909
Stop it!

01:19:35.872 --> 01:19:39.351
Stop being so
ungrateful, Christine.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.210
Your whole family is ungrateful.
Come on.

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:47.083
Mom!

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:02.365
You always got everything
you ever wanted.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:08.437
All you ever had to do was wish
for something and it was yours.

01:20:11.374 --> 01:20:12.976
Perfect Christine.

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:17.513
Beautiful Christine.

01:20:25.054 --> 01:20:26.856
I never got anything!

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.126
I'm nobody.

01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:15.338
Now, Christine...

01:21:19.342 --> 01:21:22.311
if you want to
just lay around...

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:26.025
and sleep your life away

01:21:26.049 --> 01:21:28.017
like a selfish little bitch...

01:21:30.486 --> 01:21:32.355
then be my guest.

01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:54.210
Nothing worthwhile's ever easy.

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:18.001
I want you to know that you're
making me do this, Christine.

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.971
Amy, please, stop.

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:24.273
It's all your fault.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:58.274
You've ruined everything.

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:15.558
Don't move, Miss Thomas.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.427
Charles.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.132
Amy, don't move.
They'll shoot you.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.708
I'm sorry.

01:23:37.613 --> 01:23:39.348
I'm sorry, Charles.

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:02.750
What the hell was
this all about?

01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:07.719
Who knows?

01:24:07.743 --> 01:24:10.555
So many pieces from so many
places to put together.

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:13.325
She wasn't even Amy Thomas.

01:24:13.349 --> 01:24:15.218
The real Amy Thomas
died two years ago.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.331
Then who was she?

01:24:19.355 --> 01:24:22.767
Yeah, we'll find out eventually.

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:24.951
Who knows? We might even find
out why she did all this.

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:28.950
I don't think anybody
ever really loved her.

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.301
But it's over now, isn't it?

01:24:35.204 --> 01:24:36.405
It is for her.
