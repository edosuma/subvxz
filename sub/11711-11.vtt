Hey...dude.

17:58.510 --> 18:01.012
I don't know if you had
a hand in all this,

18:01.012 --> 18:02.948
but if you did...

18:02.948 --> 18:04.550
thanks.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.125
Oh, that can't
be good.

[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

18:17.496 --> 18:19.198
Good as new.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.670
Come on!

18:24.670 --> 18:26.071
What happened?

18:26.071 --> 18:27.005
I broke the idol.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.375
What? Jeff. That is
Jennifer's.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.411
I know. Sorry.
I'll fix it.
Well, you better.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.213
I know you thought
that idol was a big joke,

18:34.213 --> 18:36.182
but you didn't have to
go break it.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.783
It was
an accident.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.685
You know me. When
things are going good,

18:39.685 --> 18:40.919
I don't change
anything.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.222
Yes, I know. I remember
that disgusting

18:43.222 --> 18:46.192
Mets winning-streak
underwear.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.093
I never should've
let you wash those.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.762
That cost us
the World Series.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.199
Now that the idol's broken...

18:53.199 --> 18:56.202
it may cost me
my super sperm.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.737
Oh, yeah. That would be
a tragedy, wouldn't it?

18:58.737 --> 19:00.906
Then you couldn't brag
to everyone about it.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.808
Uh, that's
not it.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.210
Oh, then, was is it?

19:04.210 --> 19:05.277
I guess...

19:05.277 --> 19:08.180
over the last
few months...

19:08.180 --> 19:10.249
I've just been feeling--

19:10.382 --> 19:12.151
Ah, forget it.
No, no. No, no.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.519
Just tell me.
I don't wanna!

19:13.519 --> 19:15.887
Just tell me how you feel--
Frustrated!

19:15.887 --> 19:16.388
Good. Why?

19:16.388 --> 19:17.989
Because I want us
to have a baby,

19:17.989 --> 19:19.658
and it's not happening.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.893
So you do want
to have a baby?

19:21.893 --> 19:22.861
Yeah, of course.

19:22.861 --> 19:23.929
Why would you
even say that?

19:23.929 --> 19:26.765
Well, because lately you haven't
seemed so excited

19:26.765 --> 19:27.699
about the whole thing.

19:27.699 --> 19:31.470
Because it's not happening,
and it's my fault.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.306
Oh, honey.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.676
No. Lots and lots
of things

19:37.676 --> 19:40.946
in this marriage
are your fault...

19:41.413 --> 19:44.216
but this isn't
one of 'em.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.453
Whatever happens, we're
in this thing together.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.521
Really?
Yes, we are a team.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.322
We're like the Mets.

19:50.322 --> 19:53.692
Before or after
you washed the underwear?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.227
Before.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.529
Come on.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.098
And, you know, if
breaking that idol

20:00.098 --> 20:01.300
really did ruin
your streak...

20:01.300 --> 20:03.435
you better get to
that bedroom quickly,

20:03.435 --> 20:05.136
before you lose
your, uh--

20:05.136 --> 20:06.472
Can I say it?

[SIGHS]
Yes.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.708
Super sperm.

will you forgive me?

Have I looked at so much porn
that I somehow...

20:36.235 --> 20:38.604
entered porn?

20:38.604 --> 20:40.939
Better run a little test.

do here today?

Damn. That was
inconclusive.

Maybe the only way
to know is to...

20:56.121 --> 20:58.657
make a move on her.

Well, I hope you're
good at your job,

21:01.693 --> 21:04.229

you think you're doing?
