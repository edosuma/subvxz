00:38.955 --> 00:40.540
<i>I found it.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:56.765
<i>My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>

00:56.765 --> 00:58.558
<i>If anything happens to me--</i>

01:00.977 --> 01:02.937
<i>...Kowtok. If anything happens--</i>

02:16.594 --> 02:17.971
<i>Alright, Petey, talk to me.</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:19.931
<i>I'm at the ice rink, Chief,</i>

02:19.931 --> 02:23.685
<i>and they're early,
packing up the bodies to Anchorage.</i>

02:23.685 --> 02:26.479
Of course they are.
Alright, I'll be there right away.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.691
<i>Well, Captain Connelly is here
to supervise, so.</i>

02:29.691 --> 02:32.694
What? He's there?
Alright, I'll be there in five.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.655
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Wait. Fuck.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.865
<i>Chief?</i>

02:38.157 --> 02:41.995
Ah, shit.
Hey, call Navarro and tell her that,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.872
to meet me at the police station.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.790
- <i>Chief?</i>
- Right away, okay?

02:46.791 --> 02:48.418
<i>Okay. Well, what should I say it's about?</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:49.794
- Hey!
- <i>Chief?</i>

02:49.794 --> 02:51.462
Hey, hey, Julia?

02:51.462 --> 02:55.008
Julia? It's Liz Danvers.
I work with your sister.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.803
Okay, I'm just gonna come
towards you, okay?

02:58.803 --> 03:00.013
Oh, no.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.974
Yeah, we need to get you inside.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.017
Okay, let me put that on ya.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.439
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I know.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.357
I know, I know, I know.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.484
Ya know what? I'm gonna put this on you.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.278
There ya go. There ya go.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.530
That's it. That's it.

03:17.530 --> 03:21.075
I'm gonna keep you safe.
Just gonna get you safe, baby.

03:21.075 --> 03:24.495
It's alright.
I got ya, I got ya.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.034
Okay.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.953
Yeah.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.790
You ready?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.334
Come on.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.634
Hi.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.099
I'm sorry.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.226
It's nothin'.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.646
Hey, can you wait for me downstairs?

05:14.605 --> 05:15.773
Just be a minute, okay?

05:23.364 --> 05:24.490
Thank you.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.743
Is she gonna be okay?

05:29.704 --> 05:31.622
Bodies off to Anchorage yet?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.877
Yeah, ya know, Prior's handling it, and

05:36.794 --> 05:38.921
ya know, Connelly's supervising, so.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.299
- The fuck is he here for?
- I got it, I got it.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.842
He better not be trying to take
this case away from us.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.303
Nobody's taking the case away from us.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.556
Just go be with your sister.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.853
That video.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.065
We need to talk about it.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.151
Yeah.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.067
Hey, Prior.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.780
- So, how'd it go?
- Yeah.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.410
Anyway, I think I got somethin' for you

06:51.410 --> 06:55.164
with medical records on folks
with similar injuries to the Tsalal men.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.249
Yeah, good, good, good.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.334
- Okay. Get it together. See you later.
- Okay.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.177
That kid's gonna be good.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.556
Yeah, it's a miracle of overcoming
shitty genetics.

07:13.432 --> 07:14.851
What the fuck are you doin' here?

07:16.602 --> 07:18.980
- It's good to see you too.
- No, I'm serious.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.650
Why are you here
for a routine body transport?

07:23.192 --> 07:24.861
I'm gonna stick around for a while.

07:26.112 --> 07:26.988
Fuckin' knew it.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.491
Look at me. I'm not here to take
the case away from you.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.909
Why are you here?

07:32.910 --> 07:34.620
Ya have protests around the mine,

07:34.620 --> 07:37.498
ya had a shooting
that ended in a fight in the hospital,

07:37.498 --> 07:40.626
ya got six dead bodies
in the local ice rink,

07:40.626 --> 07:42.420
and a still missing person of interest.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.422
You need to get this shit under control.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.299
- I need to show up.
- So you can look good

07:46.299 --> 07:48.217
for your Mayor campaign next year.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.887
I'm fucking helping you here, Liz.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.640
Besides, ya like havin' me in town.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.351
Fuck off.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.521
Listen.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.109
Look, just to get you up to speed,

08:06.319 --> 08:09.655
those men died before they froze.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.203
How do ya know that?
We haven't done forensics.

08:15.995 --> 08:19.874
'Cause I did a independent,
pre-forensic evaluation.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.503
I don't wanna know what that means.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.674
Look, I'm treating this
like a murder case.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.054
You saw the Annie Kowtok video I sent you?

08:35.181 --> 08:38.100
You keep that on a need-to-know basis.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.354
- Alright?
- Alright, copy.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.482
It's good to see you.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.903
What, you wanna come in here
and take my office too?

08:48.903 --> 08:51.113
- Yeah, okay.
- Or can you find yourself someplace else?

08:51.113 --> 08:53.991
- And, fuck you.
- Yeah, fuck you, too.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.454
<i>This is to fill out
your insurance information.</i>

09:01.832 --> 09:02.959
Thank you.

09:04.961 --> 09:08.673
This isn't gonna be like the other places.
I promise, okay?

09:08.673 --> 09:09.799
I'm right here in town.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.468
I'll come visit you every day.

09:12.468 --> 09:16.931
And you can keep your cell phone,
so you can call me.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.140
I'm good.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.602
I'll be here tomorrow for Christmas.

09:21.602 --> 09:28.234
I'll bring presents,
and virgin eggnog, and your $20 cookies.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.573
I can do this.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.869
You knew

09:40.621 --> 09:44.417
that you were gonna stay here,
didn't you?

09:52.383 --> 09:53.718
I'm so sorry.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.469
- You're perfect, okay?
- I'm so sorry.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.680
No. You're perfect, okay?

09:59.223 --> 10:02.768
- I love you so much, babygirl.
- I love you, too.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.985
Thank you. Are you ready?

10:12.653 --> 10:13.779
Let's go.

10:46.854 --> 10:47.897
<i>Merry Christmas, Chief.</i>

10:49.690 --> 10:51.817
His name is Otis Heiss.

10:52.693 --> 10:56.405
White male admitted to St. Joseph's,
April of '98.

10:56.405 --> 11:01.369
"Burns on both corneas, ruptured eardrums,
self-inflicted bites."

11:01.369 --> 11:02.828
You are not terrible, Prior.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.705
He's a German national.

11:04.705 --> 11:09.085
No records of employment,
no bank accounts, no credit card numbers,

11:09.085 --> 11:12.380
social security's been inactive since
November 2006

11:12.380 --> 11:15.925
and no registered address
for the past eight years.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.927
- So, no wife, no kids?
- Nope.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.930
It's like no trace, like Oliver Tagaq.

11:20.930 --> 11:26.477
Yes, but this guy has a long history
of disorderly conduct.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.854
Alright?
So, breaking and entering, petty theft.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.523
He's been in and out of rehab forever.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.607
- Okay, move.
- Possession.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.609
And if you look here,

11:33.609 --> 11:36.237
he's picked up by a Trooper in Noatak
two months ago.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.863
Zero sightings since.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.200
- So he's a junkie?
- After the accident.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.244
What was the cause of the accident?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.871
That's the thing, there is no cause.

11:46.455 --> 11:47.581
It's not out there.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.336
Alright, let's get the units out there
lookin' for him.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.298
Motels, hostels, flop-houses, dealers.

11:56.298 --> 12:00.344
The men are out there lookin' for Clark.
We don't have anybody left.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.513
What about your dad?

12:02.513 --> 12:04.682
He is at the airport.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.477
- Pickin' up his fiancÃ©e.
- Fine.

12:08.477 --> 12:12.273
Well, get the men out there
lookin' for Clark and Otis.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.191
Maybe they're in the same place,
who knows?

12:14.191 --> 12:17.319
Okay, but, I mean,
I'm gonna have to put out an APB.

12:17.319 --> 12:20.281
- That's updates, links--
- Okay, go for it then. Do it.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.283
Chief, it's Christmas Eve.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.785
Well, get on it, fast, chop-chop.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.413
- I really hate you.
- I hate you, too.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.089
Yeah?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.299
<i>There's no ice caves in the area.</i>

12:39.550 --> 12:40.426
Fuckin' Hank.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.553
Hey.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.142
- What do you mean there's no ice caves?
- <i>Annie's video.</i>

12:48.142 --> 12:50.853
There aren't any ice caves
near where her body was found.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.521
<i>You know what that means?</i>

12:52.521 --> 12:58.068
It means she was killed in one place,
and then they dumped her body in town,

12:58.068 --> 12:59.987
<i>send a message.</i>

12:59.987 --> 13:02.239
You said it, not me.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.743
<i>What about those bones
in the walls in the video?</i>

13:05.743 --> 13:08.370
<i>- Fossils?</i>
- Yeah, maybe.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.624
<i>Where's Julia?</i>

13:12.875 --> 13:17.213
In The Lighthouse.
I'm hangin' outside.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.633
- You should go home.
- <i>I don't wanna go home.</i>

13:20.633 --> 13:23.802
- It's Christmas Eve.
- Fuck Christmas Eve.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.348
Good. I got an idea.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.524
<i>How bad is it with Julia?</i>

14:19.984 --> 14:22.111
I don't know, she's--

14:23.946 --> 14:27.074
Remember when you asked
me earlier if I pray?

14:27.074 --> 14:30.703
Well, she prays a lot.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.331
And it's not a good thing? Prayin' a lot?

14:37.501 --> 14:39.420
I don't know.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.720
When my mom died

14:48.637 --> 14:51.974
my dad told us to pray.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.728
He said

14:57.313 --> 14:59.857
pray with our hearts and she'd be fine.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.152
And you prayed?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.278
Oh yeah.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.114
I prayed.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.575
From the bottom of my

15:11.327 --> 15:14.246
sorry-ass little seven-year-old
broken heart.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.543
I prayed so hard, day and night.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.004
My knees turned black.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.050
Couldn't even walk at the funeral.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.305
Maybe you didn't pray hard enough.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.059
Fuck you.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.312
<i>Still no God, though.</i>

15:43.275 --> 15:45.903
Alright, you might wanna
step in front of me.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.488
- Why?
- Well...

15:48.906 --> 15:49.948
Just forget it.

15:50.866 --> 15:51.992
Danvers.

15:53.827 --> 15:54.745
Hi.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.082
- Can I help you with something?
- Good evenin', ma'am.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.625
We're really sorry to bother you.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.252
We just need to speak with your husband
for a few minutes.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.843
Oh, you didn't.

16:10.969 --> 16:13.138
Is there anyone in this town
you haven't fucked?

16:15.766 --> 16:17.726
No, you can't be serious.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.229
- We just need five minutes.
- This is my home.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.856
- Okay, three.
- It's Christmas Eve!

16:22.856 --> 16:25.275
This is a recording of a murder, sir.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.861
<i>My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>

16:27.861 --> 16:30.239
- We do need your help.
<i>- If anything happens to me--</i>

16:35.077 --> 16:37.830
- Well?
- Yeah, those are,

16:37.830 --> 16:39.707
those are definitely whale bones.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.293
Monodontoides. Probably prehistoric.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.879
How do we find this cave?
There's no caves in the region.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.049
Actually, there are.
There's a whole ice cave system

16:49.049 --> 16:53.137
up bordering the Brooks Range,
but it's a death trap.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.640
There were a bunch of accidents up there
years ago, and it was closed.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.976
Where are they exactly?

16:58.976 --> 17:00.352
I could pull the maps

17:01.311 --> 17:03.063
but it's gonna take some time.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.023
Everyone's out for the holidays.

17:07.943 --> 17:11.780
But even if you had the maps,
you'd still need an expert to guide you,

17:11.780 --> 17:14.950
there's fissures everywhere.

17:14.950 --> 17:18.412
One wrong step and the whole bottom
could drop out from under your feet.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.873
So, what then?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.624
We need to go there.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.376
Please.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.883
Other way to do this
would be to track down

17:30.883 --> 17:32.217
whoever mapped the cave system.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.179
- You got a name?
- One second.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.140
Heiss.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.059
- Otis Heiss.
- Wait, Heiss?

17:41.059 --> 17:43.020
- Otis Heiss?
- You know him?

17:43.020 --> 17:46.690
Yep, I asked Prior
to check the medical files

17:46.690 --> 17:49.318
for anybody that had similar injuries
to the Tsalal men.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.695
Only got one ping.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.530
- Otis Heiss.
- Fuck.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.199
Adam?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.285
You guys need to go.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.580
- You're gonna get us those maps, right?
- Yeah. I'll get you the--

18:02.790 --> 18:05.125
Get 'em to ya. Get you the maps.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.323
Hey.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.659
Hey.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.827
What are you still doin' here?

19:22.786 --> 19:25.038
We are just puttin' out an APB.

19:25.038 --> 19:29.710
I'm communicatin' with the men
in the field and nearly done.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.130
That wife of yours is gonna kick your ass.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.047
Yep.

19:37.342 --> 19:41.179
- Did Irina get in okay?
- Alina? She wasn't on the plane.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.643
Did she call?

19:46.643 --> 19:49.897
Nah, I think there's some
problem with her cell service.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.151
Somethin' must've happened.
Her mother's been sick.

19:54.151 --> 19:57.154
Maybe some emergency, somethin' like that.

19:58.906 --> 19:59.823
Yeah.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.912
Listen, you didn't send her any money,
did you?

20:05.454 --> 20:08.749
I was thinking,
seeing as I'm all freed up,

20:08.749 --> 20:11.251
maybe I can come over
tonight for Christmas Eve.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.172
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.301
That sounds really nice.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.638
Obviously, just gotta finish up here

20:22.638 --> 20:25.515
and talk to Kayla, but.

20:25.515 --> 20:28.685
Take your time. I got nowhere to be,
no hurry to get there.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.543
Damn!

20:54.294 --> 20:56.213
Merry Christmas, Missy.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.257
Is everything okay?

20:59.257 --> 21:02.511
Yeah, I just stopped by to say Merry...

21:02.511 --> 21:05.013
Christmas. Jesus.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.516
- Did you make all this?
- Course, I did.

21:07.516 --> 21:11.311
All of Santa's elves
drowned in global warming, darling.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.273
And the rest are all meth-heads.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.943
This is amazing.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.946
What were you, Rose, before?

21:22.155 --> 21:24.366
You mean, before I was old and crazy?

21:25.075 --> 21:28.412
No, I mean before Alaska.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.748
Your name isn't Rose Aguineau, is it?

21:34.042 --> 21:35.919
Ya never talk about it.

21:37.754 --> 21:44.469
Well, I was a very serious professor
in a very serious school,

21:44.469 --> 21:48.098
writing very serious ideas.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.184
Why'd you leave?

21:52.060 --> 21:55.647
Well, one Tuesday morning after coffee,

21:56.732 --> 22:02.195
I sat down to polish some pompous,
useless article.

22:02.195 --> 22:06.783
And I just had enough. I had enough.

22:06.783 --> 22:13.582
Every damned word I'd written
in my entire life was meaningless.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.501
Making so much noise.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.796
So much noise.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.092
It is a little quieter here.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.429
Mostly.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.310
Except for all the fuckin' dead.

22:51.119 --> 22:54.081
<i>Liz, this is Kate McKittrick.</i>

22:54.081 --> 22:57.375
<i>We need you to come
to the mine offices, now.</i>

22:58.251 --> 22:59.795
<i>We have a problem.</i>

23:17.813 --> 23:19.731
Yeah, it's unacceptable.

23:20.440 --> 23:24.361
Great. You, talkin' about
what's unacceptable.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.780
What do you plan to do about it?

23:29.074 --> 23:31.993
Well, first, I'm gonna go home,
'cause it's Christmas Eve,

23:31.993 --> 23:33.995
and then I'm gonna call

23:33.995 --> 23:35.997
a couple of guys to come over here
and clean this up

23:35.997 --> 23:40.335
so that it's gone
before your employees get back.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.753
I wanna press charges.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.297
- No.
- No?

23:44.297 --> 23:46.383
- Yeah, no.
- You don't get a say in this.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.343
- If I wanna press charges, I will.
- Yeah, well, well,

23:48.343 --> 23:51.847
you don't get to fuck up my kid's life
just because you're pissed at me

23:51.847 --> 23:54.808
and you feel like maybe this will
make us even

23:54.808 --> 23:57.144
because you know it
won't do the trick, Kate.

23:59.729 --> 24:02.274
Look, it's Christmas.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.484
Please.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.170
Yeah, I oughta strangle you.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.796
Why do you always take their side?

24:25.881 --> 24:27.799
Just get in the fuckin' car.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.435
Hey, just checkin' in.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.812
<i>How's the room?</i>

24:40.812 --> 24:42.230
It's okay.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.107
Quiet.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.776
Good, good.

24:47.527 --> 24:51.448
Get some rest, okay?
I'll see you tomorrow morning?

24:52.741 --> 24:53.658
Yeah.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.536
I love you, Angie.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.497
I love you too, babygirl.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.767
Really?

26:02.185 --> 26:04.312
Where are you gonna spend the night?

26:05.063 --> 26:06.606
What, Prior's?

26:07.190 --> 26:09.985
Why don't you just wait
until after dinner?

26:09.985 --> 26:11.611
I'm makin' the turkey.

26:16.950 --> 26:17.867
C'mon.

26:18.576 --> 26:21.121
I'm not gonna make you
pretend anymore, alright?

26:23.623 --> 26:24.749
Fine, go.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.168
Go to Prior's.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.795
Go! Get out!

27:12.088 --> 27:13.840
<i>If anything happens to me--</i>

28:04.224 --> 28:06.810
<i>My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>

28:06.810 --> 28:08.019
<i>If anything happens to me--</i>

28:12.273 --> 28:13.400
What?

28:26.663 --> 28:27.705
<i>She's awake.</i>

28:32.669 --> 28:33.753
<i>She's awake.</i>

28:46.975 --> 28:47.851
Hello?

28:47.851 --> 28:50.145
<i>Someone cut the power.</i>

28:50.145 --> 28:52.272
- What are you talkin' about?
- <i>Molina.</i>

28:52.272 --> 28:56.234
<i>The hot one.
Tsalal guys. Molina.</i>

28:56.234 --> 29:00.029
Okay, I thought it was
a glitch in the video

29:00.029 --> 29:01.906
but the power goes out.

29:02.949 --> 29:06.661
- Are you drunk?
- <i>Well, it's the same in the Annie video.</i>

29:06.661 --> 29:09.289
<i>You're gonna see it,
that part where the power goes out?</i>

29:09.289 --> 29:11.458
It's the same M.O. in both cases.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.918
<i>Why would there be power in an ice cave?</i>

29:15.044 --> 29:18.047
I guess that is the right question.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.299
Okay, where does that get us?

29:19.299 --> 29:21.676
<i>Someone put a generator there.</i>

29:21.676 --> 29:28.224
Well, you got Oliver Tagaq,
the fucking equipment engineer guy.

29:28.224 --> 29:31.060
<i>He's got access
to the emergency generator,</i>

29:31.060 --> 29:35.565
and he was defensive and hostile
when we went to see him, right?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.193
<i>I can hear you thinkin'.</i>

29:39.444 --> 29:40.320
It's not crazy.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.030
I'm gonna come pick you up in five.

29:42.030 --> 29:46.034
Hell no! You're not goin' anywhere.
You're wasted.

29:46.034 --> 29:50.163
- I barely drink.
- Yeah, clearly.

29:50.163 --> 29:53.750
Alright, you pick me up then.

29:54.334 --> 29:58.004
I'm not goin' to a suspect
with my backup armed and shitfaced.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.049
Well, you stay where you are
and I'ma get Prior to come pick ya up.

30:02.592 --> 30:03.760
Liz.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.971
Come on, give the kid a break.
It's Christmas Eve.

30:06.971 --> 30:09.390
Prior's gonna come pick you up
in 10 minutes.

30:12.185 --> 30:15.104
- Alright, should we hit it?
- Yeah.

30:19.692 --> 30:23.196
Hey, you want me to bring this gal?
She's still got a little life in her.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.572
Nah, we're good.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.282
Yep.

30:27.867 --> 30:30.453
Hey, Chief. I put out the APB.

30:30.453 --> 30:33.498
We got everybody
lookin' out for Otis Heiss.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.792
- What, is that Danvers?
- <i>Okay, I need you to go</i>

30:35.792 --> 30:37.001
<i>- to Navarro's.</i>
- Let me talk to her.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.503
She's headed to the Nomad camps.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.839
Suspects could be armed and dangerous,

30:41.839 --> 30:44.175
- and she needs backup.
- <i>Jesus Christ, Liz.</i>

30:44.175 --> 30:48.137
Kid's got a family!
It's Christmas Eve, for Christ's sake.

30:48.137 --> 30:52.350
I wouldn't ask you
unless I really needed you.

30:54.352 --> 30:55.603
Yeah, I know.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.022
That's my boy.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.511
- Like that?
- Yeah.

31:53.202 --> 31:54.746
Sorry, freshman.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.806
She was drunk, right?

32:15.099 --> 32:17.852
Hammered. She was so fucking drunk.

32:21.939 --> 32:24.233
<i>Jesus, why are we even doing this?</i>

32:25.234 --> 32:27.320
<i>She's onto something.</i>

32:58.393 --> 33:01.479
Mr. Tagaq?
It's Evangeline Navarro, Alaska Police.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.064
Open, please.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.902
Mr. Tagaq?

33:27.338 --> 33:30.466
This feels a lot like--

34:14.427 --> 34:17.472
You need an order to go
into a man's house.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.516
When did he leave?

34:21.476 --> 34:23.519
The day after you came.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.564
We were supposed to go seal hunting.

34:30.651 --> 34:32.528
Do you have any idea what this is?

35:20.368 --> 35:21.619
Fuck.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.829
One sec!

35:24.038 --> 35:25.540
<i>Bye, guys.</i>

35:43.474 --> 35:44.809
What is that?

35:58.865 --> 35:59.657
Hi.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.829
Are you drunk?

36:04.829 --> 36:05.872
So what?

36:07.582 --> 36:09.125
Did you drive here?

36:10.877 --> 36:12.545
Don't judge me.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.349
Come here.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.811
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:46.829 --> 36:49.707
Have you been workin'
on your Hollywood smile?

36:49.707 --> 36:53.502
Is this for your campaign posters?

36:54.295 --> 36:55.463
Stop it.

36:55.463 --> 36:58.049
Or what? Where are you
gonna send me that's

36:58.049 --> 37:00.343
further away than Ennis?

37:00.343 --> 37:02.470
What, to the North Pole with Santa?

37:02.470 --> 37:05.348
It's funny, when I sent you here,
I was tryna help you.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.641
You were a fuckin' mess.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.643
That's not why you sent me here.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.772
You were scared
I was gonna take your job.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.193
Okay. You want the truth?

37:17.193 --> 37:20.237
You were a better cop than me,
from day one.

37:20.237 --> 37:22.865
But you were terrible with people,
and after...

37:23.741 --> 37:25.868
What? What?

37:28.120 --> 37:31.374
Go on. Say it.

37:32.833 --> 37:36.295
...Jake and Holden, it got worse.

37:41.968 --> 37:42.969
Bullshit.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.806
What, are you sayin' I got too emotional?

37:46.806 --> 37:49.475
No, you just got fucking shittier.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.644
Told people they sucked at their jobs.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.396
It's 'cause they sucked at their jobs.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.439
Nobody wanted to work with you, Liz.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.775
Nobody wants to work with you now.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.027
You're still a fuckin' mess.

38:00.027 --> 38:03.698
Take a look around. It's Christmas Eve
and you're here bustin' my balls.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.867
Yeah, and you're here, too,
bustin' mine, aren't ya?

38:06.867 --> 38:09.120
Liz, Liz!

38:09.120 --> 38:11.038
Do not fuckin' drive.

38:11.038 --> 38:12.289
Fuck off, Ted.

38:16.168 --> 38:19.171
<i>Mind if I move in closer?</i>

38:19.171 --> 38:21.215
<i>At least I'm gonna
say that I tried</i>

38:21.215 --> 38:23.259
<i>What's the sense
of hurting my pride?</i>

38:23.259 --> 38:26.012
<i>I really can't stay</i>

38:26.554 --> 38:32.226
<i>Baby, it's cold outside</i>

39:10.097 --> 39:12.475
- Hello.
- <i>Evangeline Navarro?</i>

39:12.475 --> 39:14.268
<i>This is Lieutenant James Ingram</i>

39:14.268 --> 39:15.936
<i>from the Alaska Coast Guard.</i>

39:15.936 --> 39:17.980
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

39:32.870 --> 39:34.413
Is everything okay?

39:36.916 --> 39:37.833
Yeah.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.044
Go be with your family.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.755
- You sure?
- Yeah, go.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.481
I'm sorry.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.194
You're not.

40:50.489 --> 40:54.410
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to let me sleep.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.876
Why don't you just say it?

41:03.878 --> 41:07.423
That I ruined your life
and you didn't wanna have the baby.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.699
<i>Bitch.</i>

41:39.622 --> 41:40.831
- Why the fuck you let her leave?
- What?

41:40.831 --> 41:42.791
Ma'am, you can't come in here after hours.

41:42.791 --> 41:46.503
My sister, Julia Navarro,
we checked her in earlier today,

41:46.503 --> 41:48.172
and you just let her walk out
the fucking door?

41:48.172 --> 41:49.381
If you want, I--

41:49.381 --> 41:50.549
Here, let me check in the system.

41:50.549 --> 41:52.134
What are you checkin'?
She's not fuckin' here!

41:52.134 --> 41:53.719
Are you listening?

41:53.719 --> 41:54.803
I'm sorry, ma'am.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.430
You don't even know she's fuckin' gone?

41:56.430 --> 41:57.848
Are you kidding me?

41:57.848 --> 42:00.184
On your computer, does it say how the fuck

42:00.184 --> 42:03.395
a mentally unstable patient
just fuckin' disappears?

42:03.395 --> 42:06.774
Ma'am, this isn't a detention center.
It's a voluntary facility.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.817
Well, it's a shit fuckin' facility.

42:09.276 --> 42:12.321
You just let people fuckin' die!
What the fuck?

42:14.198 --> 42:16.367
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

42:33.050 --> 42:35.219
Hey! We've done nothin'!

42:35.970 --> 42:37.346
Just havin' a nice--

42:44.228 --> 42:45.854
You motherfucker!

42:47.314 --> 42:48.941
Hey, hey! Fuck!

42:57.950 --> 42:59.535
Fuck you!

44:30.000 --> 44:31.126
Get up.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.174
Evangeline?

44:39.176 --> 44:43.555
Jesus fuckin' Christ!
What the fuck happened?

44:43.555 --> 44:44.807
Nothing.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.976
You should see the other guys.

44:49.478 --> 44:52.398
Shit. Slow. Slow. Slow.

44:55.025 --> 44:56.944
Holy Christ.

44:59.363 --> 45:03.867
You lost a fucking tooth?
Just stay still, just stay still.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.874
Alright, let me see. How's this?

45:11.625 --> 45:14.503
Let me see that hand.
What's goin' on? Here?

45:16.171 --> 45:17.381
No, don't.

45:22.094 --> 45:23.011
What is this?

45:23.929 --> 45:25.389
I don't know what it is.

45:26.306 --> 45:28.517
Ah, fuck!

45:29.435 --> 45:31.770
Oliver Tagaq left it for us.

45:33.272 --> 45:36.275
- Wait...
- I'm just-- It's gonna sting.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.153
Okay, yeah. Stay still.

45:39.778 --> 45:41.321
Okay.

45:44.908 --> 45:46.660
Why are you alone?

45:47.578 --> 45:49.621
My brother went to Disneyland
with all the kids,

45:49.621 --> 45:51.331
- so I'm--
- No.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.793
In life.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.840
I'm not.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.302
Yeah, you are alone.

46:03.302 --> 46:08.515
I'm alone, Danvers is alone, Rose.

46:11.393 --> 46:12.686
Hey, hey.

46:13.812 --> 46:17.149
G, baby, baby.

46:18.525 --> 46:22.070
You're not. You're not alone.

46:23.363 --> 46:24.573
Okay?

46:26.617 --> 46:30.078
Nah.
Yeah. Forget it.

46:32.873 --> 46:35.209
Fucking Christmas, right?

46:35.918 --> 46:37.836
Since you're here,

46:39.338 --> 46:41.465
I knew that you were gonna come.

46:41.882 --> 46:46.470
And I've been thinking,
you know, you and me...

46:46.470 --> 46:49.681
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Qavvik, listen--
- I really think that we can--

46:51.016 --> 46:52.059
Fuck!

46:52.059 --> 46:54.019
- It's good. It's done, it's done!
- Fuck!

46:54.019 --> 46:56.104
- It's done.
- Fuck you, Qavvik!

46:56.104 --> 46:59.066
Fuck you! Fuck!

46:59.066 --> 47:00.275
Fuck!

47:02.361 --> 47:03.904
Fuck, fuck!

47:03.904 --> 47:05.822
It's okay, it's okay.

47:07.032 --> 47:10.619
Baby, it's good. It's gonna be okay.

47:10.619 --> 47:11.620
It's okay.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.302
Peekaboo!

47:41.066 --> 47:42.526
I see you.

48:06.675 --> 48:08.552
Ah, your face. What happened?

48:09.219 --> 48:10.762
What happened to you?

48:11.972 --> 48:14.099
Well, was it Tagaq?

48:16.226 --> 48:19.146
- Hey, is Prior okay?
- He's good.

48:20.105 --> 48:22.274
Hey, what the fuck with the boots
in the house?

48:22.274 --> 48:26.278
Oliver Tagaq is gone.
He was gone when we got there.

48:27.821 --> 48:29.740
Think he knew we were comin'?

48:30.532 --> 48:32.075
He left this.

48:35.495 --> 48:37.456
- Fuck.
- What?

48:37.456 --> 48:40.709
It was a stone with the spiral on it.

48:40.709 --> 48:41.877
You lost it?

48:41.877 --> 48:45.213
Yes, I did. Alright?

48:45.213 --> 48:47.382
And I also had a rough night, okay?

48:48.425 --> 48:51.970
Oh, alright. Here, sit down.

48:53.138 --> 48:54.681
Did you sleep down here?

48:55.182 --> 48:56.933
- Maybe.
- Where's Leah?

48:57.934 --> 48:59.561
Fuck's sake.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.031
<i>Tell my mommy...</i>

49:15.118 --> 49:16.036
What?

49:16.787 --> 49:18.580
Is this his?

49:19.581 --> 49:20.832
Holden's?

49:25.212 --> 49:27.589
I don't know what weird-ass shit
you're thinkin'

49:27.589 --> 49:29.007
but just stop it.

49:30.592 --> 49:32.511
Dead people are dead.

49:32.511 --> 49:34.179
Danvers--

49:34.179 --> 49:37.432
No, there's no heaven, there's no hell,

49:37.432 --> 49:41.895
there's no ghosts fucking beyond.

49:42.646 --> 49:46.316
There's nobody out there
just waiting for us, watching us.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.819
Then why do you keep that around?

50:01.707 --> 50:03.250
There! Happy?

50:03.583 --> 50:05.711
Okay, there's nothin' except us.

50:06.378 --> 50:08.505
We're here, Navarro.

50:09.381 --> 50:10.716
Okay? Alone.

50:11.508 --> 50:13.009
The dead are gone.

50:13.468 --> 50:15.011
Fucking gone.

50:15.554 --> 50:18.557
My sister killed herself last night.

50:21.685 --> 50:22.602
What?

50:27.858 --> 50:31.528
Just walked out into the sea.
Just walked.

50:34.322 --> 50:37.284
She kept goin' until she fell into
the freezing ocean

50:37.868 --> 50:39.369
and drowned.

50:41.496 --> 50:43.623
Oh, I'm so sorry.

50:45.792 --> 50:47.711
Her body's coming today.

50:49.671 --> 50:52.215
Her dead body.

50:59.556 --> 51:03.977
They diagnosed her with schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder,

51:04.978 --> 51:06.897
borderline personality.

51:08.648 --> 51:10.817
You wanna know what was
really wrong with her?

51:11.735 --> 51:17.574
- Oh, yeah. Don't, don't, don't--
- It takes us one by one.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.661
And you know who's next?

51:21.661 --> 51:23.371
Hey, listen to me.

51:25.332 --> 51:26.792
You're an intelligent woman.

51:27.918 --> 51:29.961
- You don't have to believe that stuff.
- I failed her, Liz.

51:29.961 --> 51:32.839
You don't understand. It's a curse.

51:32.839 --> 51:36.927
My mother had it too.
Something calls us and we follow.

51:36.927 --> 51:38.595
- Stop it.
- And it's calling me now.

51:38.595 --> 51:39.638
- Stop it!
- No.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.431
- Stop it!
- She's calling.

51:41.431 --> 51:44.351
Alright, you're doin' the thing
that you did with Wheeler.

51:44.351 --> 51:48.146
Okay? Where you're seein' something.
You saw something in that room.

51:48.146 --> 51:49.815
No, I didn't.

51:50.774 --> 51:51.650
Yeah, you did.

51:54.069 --> 51:54.903
I was there.

51:56.154 --> 51:58.698
<i>Now you saw something in that room.</i>

52:00.325 --> 52:05.372
<i>It was a ghost or some kinda spirit.</i>

52:10.585 --> 52:12.170
You saw somethin'.

52:13.588 --> 52:15.131
I saw nothing.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.805
You're a liar.

52:24.057 --> 52:25.809
You're a liar.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.530
- What, Prior?
- <i>Hey, Chief?</i>

52:38.530 --> 52:40.031
<i>We just got a call in.</i>

52:40.031 --> 52:42.409
<i>Some fishermen spotted
something near the dredge.</i>

52:42.409 --> 52:45.078
<i>Wait, I'm gonna send you the photo.</i>

53:11.187 --> 53:14.733
We already checked the dredges.
Clark wasn't there.

53:16.359 --> 53:18.695
He's probably been moving around.

53:19.404 --> 53:21.531
Dredge is a good place to hide.

53:24.159 --> 53:26.620
You ever seen them
when they were still working?

53:26.620 --> 53:30.248
- When you were little?
- The dredges? Yeah.

53:32.167 --> 53:33.919
They were amazing.

53:34.502 --> 53:38.048
Then the fucking things
just got abandoned.

53:39.007 --> 53:41.134
It's still out there rotting,

53:41.760 --> 53:43.094
forgotten.

53:46.806 --> 53:48.350
Aren't we all?

55:07.387 --> 55:08.471
Clark!

55:08.471 --> 55:09.931
Stop!

55:11.641 --> 55:15.061
<i>Evangeline...</i>

55:41.254 --> 55:42.589
Navarro?

56:34.224 --> 56:36.309
Stop where you are! Ennis Police!

56:37.393 --> 56:38.311
Fucker.

57:08.925 --> 57:09.968
Raymond Clark?

57:11.302 --> 57:12.846
Hands over your head.

57:13.888 --> 57:15.014
Let me see your hands!

57:17.142 --> 57:18.268
Slowly.

57:28.528 --> 57:29.863
Otis?

57:31.781 --> 57:32.866
Otis Heiss?

57:37.745 --> 57:39.247
Leave me alone.

57:49.924 --> 57:51.593
Who gave you that coat?

57:52.635 --> 57:54.095
Was it Raymond Clark?

57:55.054 --> 57:57.974
Otis? Did he give you that coat?

58:38.890 --> 58:39.933
Otis?

58:40.892 --> 58:41.935
Talk to me.

58:43.353 --> 58:44.479
Where's Raymond Clark?

58:45.230 --> 58:50.151
He's gone. He went back down to hide.

58:50.151 --> 58:51.778
Where is he hiding?

58:53.988 --> 58:55.073
Navarro?

58:59.619 --> 59:00.745
Navarro.

59:02.455 --> 59:05.041
Where you been?
I've been lookin' for you everywhere.

59:05.041 --> 59:07.293
Otis, where is he hiding?

59:07.293 --> 59:09.712
He's hiding in the Night Country.

59:19.013 --> 59:22.767
We're all in the Night Country now.
