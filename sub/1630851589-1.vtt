00:38.460 --> 00:40.100
Looking for something?

00:40.180 --> 00:42.020
Yes, a grave.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.140
No one's had time to die here yet.
You can see there is no graveyard.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.380
This was a long time ago.

00:48.420 --> 00:51.180
Actually, not such a long time.
Nearly three years.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.620
I buried a friend here.
A friend.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.700
Huge trees stood here.
A cedar and a fir tree.

00:59.220 --> 01:02.020
Remember them?

01:01.780 --> 01:04.300
Probably chopped down
when the settlement was built.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.380
Could it be those?

01:49.420 --> 01:51.180
Dersu!

02:30.860 --> 02:34.700
In the islands, the hunter

02:34.820 --> 02:38.300
Roams all day long

02:38.380 --> 02:41.540
But no luck for him

02:41.700 --> 02:45.460
And he curses himseIf

02:45.580 --> 02:48.860
What's he going to do

02:50.900 --> 02:55.780
How is he to serve

02:55.900 --> 03:00.300
He cannot be cheerful

03:00.420 --> 03:04.940
So what
He'll try to aim better

03:06.020 --> 03:09.620
So the hunter goes

03:09.780 --> 03:12.580
To warmer waters

03:12.660 --> 03:15.980
Where the fish were frolicking

03:16.060 --> 03:19.420
In the beautiful weather

03:19.540 --> 03:23.740
There on the shore

03:27.020 --> 03:28.540
That year...

03:28.660 --> 03:31.420
my assignment was
to go to the Shkotovo area...

03:31.500 --> 03:33.380
in the Ussurii region...

03:33.500 --> 03:36.860
to make a topographic survey.

04:28.380 --> 04:33.740
Sometimes mountains and forests
look cheerful and attractive.

04:35.260 --> 04:39.580
At other times,
they seem sullen and wild.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.740
This isn't just my own feeling.

04:45.220 --> 04:48.940
All the men in the unit
share this feeling.

04:51.260 --> 04:55.300
With God's help,
we will spend the night here.

04:55.380 --> 04:58.500
And tomorrow,
we'll find a more cheerful place.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.420
Very well.
We'll halt here for the night.

05:00.540 --> 05:02.340
Yes, we'll stay here for the night.

06:07.500 --> 06:11.780
That valley reminded me...

06:11.860 --> 06:13.700
of Walpurgis Night...

06:14.980 --> 06:19.260
a place where witches
would gather for their Sabbath.

07:12.220 --> 07:14.100
What's that?

07:14.220 --> 07:15.700
A falling rock.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.540
Is someone coming down?

07:27.420 --> 07:28.900
It's a bear!

07:36.780 --> 07:40.700
Please to not shoot!
Me are people!

08:10.380 --> 08:12.020
Hello, Captain.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.020
Look. A man.

08:24.660 --> 08:26.540
You said it was a bear.

08:58.820 --> 09:00.780
Won't you join us?

09:02.260 --> 09:04.140
Thanks.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.580
I am very hungry.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.540
Nothing to eat today.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.540
Who are you?

09:51.700 --> 09:53.300
A Chinese?

09:54.580 --> 09:56.300
A Korean?

09:56.380 --> 09:58.220
No. Me is Goldi.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.540
A hunter?

10:07.020 --> 10:10.300
Me hunt all the time.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.220
No other job.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.420
Where do you live?

10:19.580 --> 10:21.300
Not have home.

10:21.420 --> 10:26.860
Build a shack and sleep,
and living like in a home.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.620
No luck today?

10:35.020 --> 10:38.820
Today shoot at stag.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.580
Me not hurt him much.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.700
Stag run away.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.620
Me follow after it.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.820
Me see people tracks.

10:47.900 --> 10:51.020
Me go slow.
Me think:

10:51.100 --> 10:54.100
''What kind of people
so far in the hills?''

10:54.180 --> 10:56.780
Me look close.

10:56.900 --> 11:00.500
See Captain, soldiers.

11:00.620 --> 11:03.340
So me come here quick.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.900
Why did you miss the stag
if you're such a good hunter?

11:08.220 --> 11:11.460
You never miss?

11:11.540 --> 11:14.740
We're soldiers.
We're not supposed to miss.

11:15.820 --> 11:20.020
You great hunter, shoot all beasts...

11:20.140 --> 11:21.980
we don't have anything to eat.

11:44.460 --> 11:47.820
Hey, you!
Enough babble!

11:52.300 --> 11:53.940
Well, well.

12:07.420 --> 12:11.180
Here. Now you can babble.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.980
My name is Arseniev.
What's yours?

12:28.060 --> 12:29.540
Dersu Uzala.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.260
How old are you?

12:43.620 --> 12:45.420
I don't know well.

12:46.460 --> 12:49.260
Me live a long, long time.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.220
Do you have a family?

12:55.900 --> 12:59.500
They all die long ago.

13:05.860 --> 13:10.100
Before, I had a wife...

13:10.180 --> 13:12.020
son and girl.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.340
The smallpox finish all people.

13:18.460 --> 13:22.380
Now me left alone.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.300
Look, Dersu.

13:42.700 --> 13:47.260
We are surveying this area--

13:47.340 --> 13:49.940
the ranges, passes and rivers.

13:51.340 --> 13:53.460
Will you be our guide?

14:03.420 --> 14:06.220
Necessary me think.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.780
Stop it.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.700
Well, think it over.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.220
Now, let's go to sleep.

14:35.380 --> 14:37.420
The next day,
without saying a word...

14:37.500 --> 14:40.500
Dersu took his place
at the head of our squad.

14:56.340 --> 14:58.340
There is a road here.

15:07.660 --> 15:11.100
- A road!
- Come here! There's a road!

15:11.220 --> 15:12.940
What's there?

15:13.060 --> 15:16.780
This road two, three days before,
one people come.

15:16.860 --> 15:18.940
Then rain come.

15:19.060 --> 15:21.220
These people Chinese.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.340
Where did you get that?

15:23.420 --> 15:26.380
How you not understand?
Look well!

15:26.500 --> 15:30.500
He wear Chinese boots.
Water in his tracks.

15:34.020 --> 15:37.060
You the same as children.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.980
Eyes not see.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.900
You live in the forest, die soon.

15:49.940 --> 15:51.740
Chinese!

15:51.820 --> 15:53.380
Let's go!
Let's go!

16:16.140 --> 16:18.860
Soon we find shack.

16:18.940 --> 16:20.780
How do you know?

16:22.060 --> 16:23.580
Look!

16:23.700 --> 16:25.940
Strip bark.
Make roof.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.540
The rain-soaked ashes...

16:53.700 --> 16:55.540
the bed of grass...

16:58.660 --> 17:01.860
and a discarded piece
of Chinese fabric...

17:01.980 --> 17:04.780
all confirmed Dersu's words.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.420
Obviously, a Chinese spent the night
a couple of days ago.

18:49.740 --> 18:51.580
Did you see that?

19:20.020 --> 19:21.540
Yegor!

19:34.420 --> 19:38.380
Captain.
Rice, salt, matches, give some.

19:38.540 --> 19:40.060
What do you need it for?

19:40.220 --> 19:44.860
Rice, salt, matches.
Wrap in birch bark, put in shack.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.260
You plan to return?

19:47.340 --> 19:49.180
Why return?

19:49.260 --> 19:52.060
Other people come.

19:52.220 --> 19:54.660
Find dry wood.

19:54.780 --> 19:56.740
Find food. Not die.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.940
Olentiev!

20:04.980 --> 20:09.380
Bring matches, rice and salt.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.140
At your command.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.580
This Goldi filled me
with admiration.

20:32.820 --> 20:35.180
He had amazing insight...

20:36.260 --> 20:39.020
acquired during his long life
in the forest.

20:41.180 --> 20:44.420
Besides, he had a beautiful soul.

20:47.140 --> 20:50.060
He provided for the needs
of a person he didn't know...

20:51.100 --> 20:53.300
and probably wouldn't ever see.

21:15.820 --> 21:19.660
Dersu, let's wait
until the rain stops.

21:19.740 --> 21:21.580
Time to get ready.

21:22.820 --> 21:25.940
Listen good.
Birds are starting to sing.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.020
Rain soon stop.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.940
Sun is coming out.

21:41.180 --> 21:44.140
Dersu, do you know what the sun is?

21:43.100 --> 21:44.900
Everyone knows the sun.

21:47.300 --> 21:50.140
Could be that
you've never seen the sun?

21:50.260 --> 21:52.380
Look, there it is.

22:19.820 --> 22:21.940
Captain.

22:22.060 --> 22:25.060
Sun is the most important men.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.060
This men die, all die.

22:32.020 --> 22:34.820
And this is another important men.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.940
This is bad men. Shout.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.820
If one listens to you,
everything around are men.

23:06.260 --> 23:09.820
Look. All is men.
Water alive.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.740
Well, you said it.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.900
Is fire alive too?

23:17.020 --> 23:19.500
Yes, fire is still men.

23:22.340 --> 23:25.380
Fire angry,
forest burn for many days.

23:27.460 --> 23:29.900
Fire get angry, frightful.

23:30.020 --> 23:32.020
Water get angry, frightful.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.220
Wind get angry, frightful.

23:34.340 --> 23:37.980
Fire, water, wind.
Three mighty men.

23:52.380 --> 23:55.660
The first snow fell that day.

24:12.580 --> 24:14.700
- Why shoot?
-Just for fun.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.060
- Step back, Dersu.
- Waste bullets, bad.

24:17.140 --> 24:19.780
What waste? We're soldiers.
We're practicing.

24:24.100 --> 24:26.620
- Screw it!
- Seryoga drank too much.

24:26.740 --> 24:28.860
Let me try. Taras!

24:45.780 --> 24:47.260
What a shot!

24:53.380 --> 24:54.900
Go!

25:05.900 --> 25:07.420
What the hell?

25:07.500 --> 25:09.980
It's harder than
bringing down a flying bird.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.220
Good shooter not miss.

25:12.340 --> 25:15.020
Go ahead, old man.
Try it yourself.

25:15.100 --> 25:19.180
Why shoot and smash? Why break?
Where in forest you find bottle?

25:19.260 --> 25:21.580
Are you trying to
worm your way out of it?

25:21.660 --> 25:22.940
Just admit you won't hit it.

25:23.020 --> 25:26.340
Me not shoot at bottle.
Me shoot at rope.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.140
Bottle fall down,
you give me bottle.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.860
Hit the rope?
Go ahead.

25:29.940 --> 25:32.740
It's yours if you hit the rope,
and I will fill it with vodka.

25:32.820 --> 25:34.700
Go, Marchenko!

25:37.500 --> 25:38.980
Go!

25:54.620 --> 25:55.820
What a man!

25:55.940 --> 25:58.100
He certainly put one over
on you, Olentiev!

25:59.260 --> 26:01.300
Get ready to set out, men.

26:06.580 --> 26:08.900
Go, go!

26:11.340 --> 26:13.300
Once again, once again!

26:24.740 --> 26:26.220
You won!

26:42.580 --> 26:44.380
- Where is Dersu?
- God knows.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.100
He suddenly decided to take
his portion of vodka and went off.

26:47.220 --> 26:49.300
- He's sitting by the river.
- What's he doing?

26:49.380 --> 26:52.140
Sitting by the fire and singing.
Probably drunk.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.340
Let me tie it.

29:16.260 --> 29:18.460
May I sit with you
for a while, Dersu?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.300
Captain.

29:41.500 --> 29:46.620
Over there my wife and kids die.

29:46.700 --> 29:47.940
Smallpox.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.100
Everyone afraid of smallpox.

29:54.220 --> 29:59.140
Wife, kids, house,
all together burn.

30:07.660 --> 30:13.220
Last night bad dream had.

30:16.100 --> 30:19.780
Yurt will be soon fall down.

30:20.980 --> 30:24.220
Wife, kids in this yurt...

30:24.300 --> 30:26.860
all get freezing.

30:26.940 --> 30:29.260
No eat.

30:29.340 --> 30:33.540
So me come here,
give them everything.

31:21.540 --> 31:24.420
Yesterday, an old men walked along.

31:24.540 --> 31:26.380
This men didn't sleep the night.

31:27.700 --> 31:32.180
- How do you know?
- No sign at camp fire that he sleep.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.060
How do you know he's old?

31:35.180 --> 31:37.580
Young man always walk on his toes.

31:37.700 --> 31:40.740
Old man always walk on his heels.

31:50.540 --> 31:54.820
I met that old Chinese
a few days later.

32:38.700 --> 32:42.180
His name is Li Tsung-ping.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.540
He is 64.

32:44.620 --> 32:46.980
He come from Tientsin.

32:48.420 --> 32:50.300
How did he land here?

32:57.060 --> 33:00.260
Was a woman.
His brother took her.

33:00.380 --> 33:03.780
He went into the mountains.

33:03.860 --> 33:05.700
For 40 years live alone.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.340
Thank you.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.060
It's cold already.

34:29.340 --> 34:31.780
Maybe we should invite the old man
to come over to our fire.

34:33.260 --> 34:35.139
Don't, Captain.

34:35.260 --> 34:37.179
Don't disturb him.

34:47.659 --> 34:50.860
Him now think very much.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.660
He see house, he see garden...

35:00.580 --> 35:02.820
all in blossom.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.780
Captain! Captain!

35:36.180 --> 35:38.940
Li Tsung-ping come say good-bye.

35:39.060 --> 35:40.860
Him now go home.

37:24.260 --> 37:26.460
The ultimate goal
of this expedition...

37:26.540 --> 37:30.220
was to explore the area
around Lake Khanka.

37:31.500 --> 37:36.340
We had to cross bigs swamps
and roadless tracts.

37:36.420 --> 37:40.820
I sent most of the men
and horses to Chernigovka.

37:40.980 --> 37:44.860
Dersu, Olentiev, Krushinovandl...

37:44.980 --> 37:47.580
set out for the lake in a flatboat.

38:11.340 --> 38:15.260
Olentiev, stay here and make camp.

38:15.340 --> 38:19.340
Dersu and I will go on.

38:19.420 --> 38:20.940
Unload.

38:58.140 --> 38:59.900
Captain!

39:00.060 --> 39:04.060
Us go back soon?
Me little scared.

39:04.180 --> 39:08.060
Lake Khanka is not far.
We won't stay there long.

39:08.220 --> 39:11.260
All right, Captain,
you see for yourself.

39:11.340 --> 39:13.620
What is okay is okay.

39:33.940 --> 39:39.260
Silence layover
the frozen reaches of the lake.

39:41.340 --> 39:46.940
Some menace to humans
was lurking in this silence.

39:55.900 --> 39:57.820
Captain!

39:57.900 --> 40:00.660
Have to go back quick.

40:00.740 --> 40:02.700
The wind cover our tracks.

40:02.820 --> 40:04.620
Yes, yes, let's go.

41:37.340 --> 41:39.940
Never mind, Dersu.

41:40.020 --> 41:43.340
Now we'll know where we came from.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.020
From there!

42:48.940 --> 42:52.620
Captain!
Us weren't here. Bad!

44:27.300 --> 44:30.580
Captain! Us lose road!

44:30.700 --> 44:33.340
Road there.
But how do we get there?

44:33.460 --> 44:35.260
There is water all around.

44:49.300 --> 44:52.260
Captain! Sun is low.

44:52.340 --> 44:55.100
Soon night come.
Night come, we die.

44:55.220 --> 44:57.940
If the camp is close by,
they'll hear us.

45:15.900 --> 45:17.940
We'll have to spend
the night here, Dersu.

45:18.020 --> 45:20.940
It's dangerous to go on.
What shall we do?

45:24.580 --> 45:27.460
Captain! Listen.
Listen good.

45:28.780 --> 45:33.220
Have to work fast.
Us not work good, us die.

45:33.340 --> 45:35.940
- What work?
- Cut grass.

46:51.940 --> 46:54.580
Captain! Work fast!

48:36.940 --> 48:39.020
Captain! Work fast!

50:22.700 --> 50:26.540
Captain! Must hold grass!

51:09.380 --> 51:11.060
Take rope!

52:22.020 --> 52:24.260
Captain! Get up! Get up!

52:35.460 --> 52:39.780
As the wind howled,
I sank into darkness.

52:41.300 --> 52:43.620
I don't know how long I slept.

53:18.820 --> 53:21.380
Hey, bear!

53:21.500 --> 53:25.020
Climb out of den!
Sun is up!

55:18.500 --> 55:21.380
Only then did I realize
what Dersu had done for me.

55:22.420 --> 55:24.700
His witshad saved me.

55:33.380 --> 55:35.980
Thank you, Dersu.
Thank you.

55:36.060 --> 55:37.900
What would I have done without you?

55:37.700 --> 55:40.780
Go together, work together.
No need thanks.

55:46.300 --> 55:48.140
That's Olentiev!

56:28.900 --> 56:31.140
From that point on...

56:31.220 --> 56:33.060
our expedition became more difficult.

56:40.260 --> 56:42.060
Let's go! Go!

56:46.540 --> 56:48.820
Severe frost.

56:48.940 --> 56:50.780
Exhaustion.

56:50.900 --> 56:52.220
Hunger.

56:53.780 --> 56:58.780
Man is very small
before the face of nature.

58:31.980 --> 58:35.940
Forward! Forward! Don't stop!

58:36.020 --> 58:37.860
Forward!

58:48.300 --> 58:51.060
Captain!
Me find smell of smoke.

58:53.340 --> 58:55.140
Udegheis are frying fish.

59:00.380 --> 59:02.220
Thank you.

59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.900
Captain.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.460
Where go tomorrow?

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:11.580
We'll reach Chernigovka,
join our men there...

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.460
and then take the train
to Vladivostok.

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.460
Come with me.
It's nice and comfortable in town.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.100
No, thank you.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.820
Me cannot.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.220
What me work in town?

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.220
Hunting, no.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.140
Sable chase, no.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.140
At least come to the station with me.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.140
I'll get food
and some money for you there.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.300
Me food, money not need.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.460
Me now search sables.

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:01.540
Sables same money.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.820
What's the matter, Dersu?

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.900
Me bad man.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.980
Me want some cartridge.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.220
Olentiev, give him
everything that's left.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.100
Thank you, Captain.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.420
Me tomorrow go straight ahead.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.660
Four suns go.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.140
Find Daubikhe...

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.820
then go Ulakhen...

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.140
then Fujin.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.780
Me heard...

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.300
many, many sable there.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.180
Deer too.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.340
Me heard about it.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:44.420
People around say.
Now me understand.

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.500
Good-bye, military men.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.860
Farewell.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.420
Good-bye, Dersu.
Maybe we'll meet again.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.980
Good-bye, Captain.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.420
Well...

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.620
Maybe we'll meet again.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.180
Good-bye.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.900
He's a fine man.
I never met anyone like him.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.420
He's a rare man.
May God give him good health.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.460
In the islands, the hunter

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:13.620
Roams all day long

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.460
But no luck for him

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.580
And he curses himseIf

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:28.100
What's he going to do

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.420
How is he to serve

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:36.700
He cannot be cheerful

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.100
So what
He'll try to aim better

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:44.220
So the hunter goes

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.100
To warmer waters

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.180
That spring...

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.020
once again I set out to traveI
across the Ussurii area.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.020
Go! Go!

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.979
Where are you going?

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:08.939
To the left!

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.420
Careful! Look after the horses!

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.900
For three months, we have been
walking in the forest.

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.220
Spring in the forest
quickly gave way to summer.

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.500
We've explored a large area.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:57.460
But if we had Dersu,
we'd have accomplished more.

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.700
All this time,
I was thinking with anticipation...

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.980
that maybe I would meet him again.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.900
Where are you, Dersu?

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:28.220
Up the spring, go!

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.580
Faster, guys.
Bring the water.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.220
Andriucha!
Throw up more branches!

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.140
What is taking so long?

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.020
Faster, faster! Don't smile!

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.420
And you said you would bring a boar!

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.660
Vladimir Pavlovich.
I met a hunter two miles from here.

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:26.580
He was asking about our unit--
who we are, who's the captain.

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:29.340
Did you tell him?

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.380
How could I, sir?
I know how to keep a military secret.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.260
Eh, Turtygin, Turtygin.
Did he remain there?

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:39.180
No, sir. He started
to collect his backpack.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.740
Vladimir Pavlovich!
Your rifle!

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.940
- Hello, Captain!
- Hello, Dersu!

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.380
You are my dear man.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.060
You haven't changed at all, Dersu.

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.940
Haven't changed.
Haven't grown older.

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:59.500
You, my eagle with blue-black wings

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:09.420
Where have you been flying
for so long

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:25.060
How have you been these years?

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.260
Shot lots of sables?

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.900
Plenty.

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.540
- Get much money.
- Oh! That's good!

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.140
Only all this money go.

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:40.700
How come?

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:45.060
Rich trader me invite.
Much vodka.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.500
Me give him money to keep for me.

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:50.260
After that, his men no where.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.180
Why so?

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.580
Me don't understand.

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:16.180
You, my eagle with blue-black wings

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:25.420
Where have you been flying
forso Iong

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:35.700
I was flying there over the mountains

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:45.860
Where it all was silence

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:53.140
Next morning,
the forest was shrouded in thick fog.

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:57.060
We were leading the way.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:00.820
I was confident
because Dersu was now with me.

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:11.140
Dersu, what do you think?

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.900
Will the weather clear up?

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.940
Yes.

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:19.900
Earth and hill all sweating now.

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:21.820
Soon they'll get completely well.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.980
Why are they lagging behind?

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.500
It's high time
they catch up with us.

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.060
Let us wait.

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:35.580
Me lost pipe.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.460
Me think pipe be near.
Must go back.

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.620
How I lose pipe?

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:50.380
Either got old...

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.020
or my head got bad.

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.500
Look, Captain.
This is track tiger.

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.500
Him behind us go.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.500
When us come here,
was not track on road.

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:33.140
Him close here.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.780
When us stopped over there,
he was right here!

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:40.380
Me go back, tiger run away.

01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:01.060
That is nothing, Captain.
Tiger never make big noise.

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.620
Excuse us, Captain, for lingering.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.940
Two horses got stuck in the bog.

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:12.820
Is this your pipe, Dersu?

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.140
- What is it with you?
- There's a tiger nearby.

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:25.820
Hey, guys, careful!

01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.300
A tiger's nearby!

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:29.660
Calm down!

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:34.060
Calm down, I say!

01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:37.140
Come on, come on!

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:57.020
Again tiger go our track!

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.380
Why go behind?
What do you need, tiger?

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.780
What do you want?

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:11.220
Us go road, not bother you,
and you go behind!

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.340
Is there not enough space
in forest, tiger?

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.340
Let's go!

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.820
Why have you halted?

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.460
Looks like fallen trees there.

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.820
- Dersu, what's that?
- Ludiovo.

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.540
Ludiovo? And what's that?

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.860
Animals go to river, drink water.

01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:54.340
Want to go round trunks and branches
and fall into pit.

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:57.220
They catch animals, sell the skins.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.740
Detail several men to follow me.

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:06.700
Belonozhkin, Zagourskii, Zakharov,
Bochkariov, follow me.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.860
Careful.

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.180
Look here.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.420
Look in the other pits.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:38.740
Go.

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.700
Sir! A doe and two reindeer there.
Already dead.

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.100
Pasha, what do you have there?

01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:54.540
I found two pits.

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.740
Only carrion in there.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.180
What about you, Andriucha?

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.100
I fell in myself!

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.260
Vasia! Vasia!

01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:10.100
- What's there?
- I found a whole flaying house!

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:14.860
- Who did it?
- Bad Chinese did this.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.940
Why leave ludiovo, but not fill holes?

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:21.460
Bad to kill animals for nothing.

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.540
Bring axes and hoes here!

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:11.940
What happened, Dersu?

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:13.540
Hounhous! Chinese bandits!

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.220
They make holes in my shirt,
and I make holes in theirs!

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.020
- How many are there?
- Eight.

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:26.020
Turtygin, two remain here.
The rest ofyou follow me.

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.300
They got away, the vipers.

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:57.420
Hounhous bad Chinese.
Bad.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.260
Steal money, fur.

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.460
Steal wife, kill men.

01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.460
Sir, here.

01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:40.020
Hounhous steal three women.

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.860
Me not understand
what they do with men.

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:53.380
Turtygin!

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.460
Hey, guys, come here quick!

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.900
Much mosquito, horsefly there.

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:08.740
By night your face like this.

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:10.220
Then much pain.

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.860
Then die.

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:14.500
Good us found at daytime.

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.060
Very, very good.

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:18.540
All alive.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.820
I'll kill those Hounhous!

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.220
Hounhous!

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:34.300
That Chang Pao, not Hounhous!

01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:46.660
My name's Chang Pao.
We fight Hounhous.

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:49.140
I'm Arseniev.
We're exploring this area.

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.620
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:01.380
They took the women with them,
as always.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.700
Hounhous go there.
Move, hurry!

01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:07.700
Dersu, calm down.
They won't get far away.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.740
Will you take care of these men?

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.980
Detachment, fall in.

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.980
Detachment, fall in.

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.060
In those places
where they robbed and killed...

01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.300
people told us that the bandits
are not more than ten.

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.860
We'll handle them ourselves.

01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.460
Well, good luck then.

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.380
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.020
Danger no.
Hounhous end.

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:04.260
At first sight, this river
seemed quiet and peaceful.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:11.180
I sent some men with horses
to look for a place to ford it.

01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:15.620
I myself with the others
tried to cross the river on a raft.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.300
Stand here.

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:27.740
Let me.

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:40.900
Pull it!

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:55.700
Give me the weapons.

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.660
The pole! Where's the pole?

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:25.300
The pole! Throw it!

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.100
Come on! Do it!

01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:35.260
Go along the bank, men!

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.860
Along the bank!
Run along the bank!

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.340
Get ahead of us! Ahead!

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.540
Run ahead!

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:15.660
Jump, Captain, jump!

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.140
Come on, come on!

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:56.380
- If we only had a rope!
- We used all the rope for the raft!

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:01.700
Cut down tree! Cut down!

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.660
- This one?
- No!

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:13.220
- This one?
- No!

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:20.740
- This one?
- Uh-huh!

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.340
Get the axes!

01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:28.300
Tie the tree! Quick!

01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:30.220
Tie the tree!

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.500
Take off your belts!

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.100
These will do too.

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:02.460
- We'll need levers.
- Cut them!

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:28.460
Hold on! Hold on!

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.780
Come on, guys, faster, faster!

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.140
How are you there?

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:13.820
Hold it!

01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.980
Let it go little by little!

01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.220
Go, go, go!

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.180
Hold it! Let go!

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.540
Dersu, give me your hand!

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.940
Grab me!

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.020
You were like a bear!

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:45.940
Summer end, Captain.

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:47.860
Autumn come.

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.540
That's good.
A bit to the left.

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:55.660
A bit to the left.
Good.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:04.860
Okay, get ready.

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.780
Attention.

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.020
Hold it.

01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:11.460
Good.

01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:15.860
Turtygin, come here.
Now you take a picture of us.

01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.820
Press here, okay?

01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:37.380
My fondest memories of Dersu...

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:41.660
are connected with
the beginning of that autumn.

01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.980
- What's wrong with that horse?
- Tiger.

01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:16.300
Listen, tiger!

01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:19.740
Soldiers fire rifle!

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.500
You go away. Go away!

01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:55.220
What me do?

01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:57.940
Kill tiger.

01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:02.140
The tiger ran away.
He's unharmed.

01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:05.980
No, tiger always run until die.

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:10.340
Now me much frightened.

01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:12.780
Don't be afraid, Dersu.

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:14.980
A dead tiger can't harm you.

01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.900
Kanga will!

01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:18.820
He send another tiger!

01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:25.540
Kanga is a forest spirit
whom the Goldi worship.

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:30.300
From that day Dersu changed.

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.820
He became morose and irritabIe.

01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:36.460
What you do?

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:40.540
That sign say no ginseng here.

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:47.340
You break.

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:50.580
People search for ginseng,
all for nothing.

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.100
Bad man are you.

01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:28.860
So he just jumped in the river
in all his clothes. He was drunk.

01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:31.900
In all his clothes!

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:36.340
And I had an adventure--

01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:38.700
Why throw meat into fire?

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:42.220
Meat throw into fire, lose.

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:45.380
Tomorrow we go,
other people here come...

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.140
see meat, eat.

01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:49.580
Who would come here?

01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:51.700
How's that? Who come?

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:54.660
Badger come, marten come.

01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:57.980
Crow come, mouse come.

01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.260
All kinds of men in forest.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.000
Good evening, Dersu.

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.320
I say, salute!

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:54.680
The Ussurii autumn is brief.

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.400
Winter colds come fast.

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.760
I started getting ready for winter...

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:04.760
and sent some of the men
with all our horses to Olga Bay.

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:09.880
Smells! Men here!

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.800
- What men?
- Boars!

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.480
I don't smell anything.

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:34.680
- Dersu, why didn't you shoot?
- I not see.

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.960
Why not me see boar?

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.960
My nose see better than eyes.

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.360
I did not know then...

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.720
that this small incident
was a fore runner of tragic events.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.680
A stag!

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.160
Where, Captain?

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.240
Where?

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.280
There, under the half-fallen tree.

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.480
- Did I hit it?
- No.

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.960
Didn't you see it?

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:25.400
Everyone misses sometimes, Dersu.

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.640
Why me not hit it?

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:21.400
Captain! Before,
I always first see an animal!

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:23.960
Shoot, always hit target.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:26.680
Now not hit.
Bad are my eyes.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:29.520
How I live in forest now?

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.840
Come to Khabarovsk with me.

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.760
My home is your home.

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:40.480
New Year's Eve came.

01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:01.800
It was a strange night.

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:52.280
The tiger come to kill me.

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.480
Thank you, Captain!
Thank you!

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:06.840
What happened, Dersu?

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:10.760
Captain, you say your home my home.
Thank you, Captain!

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:12.840
Will you come with me to my place?

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.280
My eyes get bad.

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.920
Kanga not want me to live in forest.

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:19.520
He send the tiger.

01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:39.040
Probably what Dersu
called the tiger...

01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:41.920
was the specter of
his fear of the forest...

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:46.320
conjured by the imagination...

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.560
of a man grown old.

01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:16.840
Listen here.
Vova recorded Dersu.

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.280
Well, well.

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:32.320
The Captain go hills, work.

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.400
Go back to city...

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.400
sit at a table, write, work.

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:42.960
Me no work in the city.

01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.160
Stare into fire.

01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:48.840
Look at hills far away.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.840
And that's it.

01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:52.320
It's true.

01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.720
He doesn't like the city.

01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:57.000
Never mind.
He'll get used to it.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.200
Vova, did Dersu hear it?

01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:03.920
Yes.

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:07.800
- What did he say?
- He said, ''Right, not word miss.''

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.480
Does he often talk to you
about the forest?

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.920
Yes. Dersu is not
afraid of anything.

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.400
Neither of wolves,
nor of boars, or of bears.

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:23.280
Snow storms and floods
are nothing for him.

01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:27.200
You know, Dersu is Vova's hero.

01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:29.120
He is crazy about him.

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:33.280
And I owed him my life
on several occasions.

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:36.120
He never mentioned it.

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:39.520
Well, he thinks it is quite
a regular thing to do.

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:45.760
Most people like to boast
about such things and exaggerate.

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:43.240
This men always with me
roam the forest...

01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:45.640
many, many years.

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:06.600
This is a bear tooth...

01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:13.360
and claws.

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:22.440
And these are claws of lynx.

01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.760
For you. Take.

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:29.680
You give it to me?

01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:32.920
Yes, Little Captain.

01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:34.040
Really?

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.880
I am so happy.
It will be my talisman.

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:40.760
Don't you have tiger claws?
Didn't you hunt a tiger?

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:44.480
I shoot at tiger but--

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.760
It bad to kill tiger.

01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:51.960
Why?

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.360
Very...

01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:56.240
very bad.

02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:27.400
Take this. Thank you.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.280
Why give money for water?

02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.200
Much water is in river.

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:39.200
- Why you take money for water?
- What?

02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:41.160
You don't understand anything.

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:45.680
You are bad man!

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.840
- Where are you going?
- Shoot.

02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:00.440
Don't even think of it! It's not
allowed to shoot guns in a city.

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:02.640
In barrel much dirt.

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:05.440
Me shoot a bullet, clean barrel.

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:08.160
Then wipe with cloth, shoot well.

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:10.840
There are many people here.
It's dangerous.

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:14.080
Me fire not people.
Me fire at air.

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:17.440
All the same, you cannot.
The city isn't the same as the hills.

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:18.880
Do you understand?

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:22.640
Do you?

02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:46.920
Well, how are you, Dersu?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.840
Sit I here, just like duck.

02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:00.080
How can men sit in box?

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.160
You are right.

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:05.440
It isn't a very nice room.

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:19.000
We'll have to change the wallpaper...

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:21.280
make everything more cozy.

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:27.280
Meanwhile,
what if you live in my study.

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:31.400
Don't bother, Captain.

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.760
I pitch tent outdoors.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.320
Sleep.

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.080
I don't disturb anyone.

02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:43.480
See, Dersu...

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:46.400
it's not allowed in a city.

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:49.200
Why not?

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.520
Bad!

02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:55.120
How should I explain?

02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.600
That's a rule.

02:02:57.680 --> 02:02:59.040
A rule.

02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:03.520
Shoot a gun I can't.

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:05.480
Sleep outdoors I can't.

02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.840
I not get enough air at all.

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:32.520
Pa, what happened?
Dersu's been arrested!

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.400
The police just called.

02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:35.800
What is it again?

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:39.240
You know, he saw me buying firewood
yesterday and grew very angry...

02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:42.120
and went to the city park
to chop down a tree.

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:34.520
Please...

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:37.240
let me go back to hills.

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:40.320
Live in city I cannot.

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:44.160
Where will you go?

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:46.400
To the hills.

02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:49.680
Captain.

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.640
Missus.

02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:01.320
Little Captain.

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:05.200
All fine people.

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:07.320
Me go-- bad!

02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:12.200
But I cannot live in a city.

02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:14.440
Here, take this rifle as a gift.

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.320
New model.

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.840
It's easy to aim.

02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:25.320
Même avec une vue faible
tu toucheras au but.

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:33.670
Thank you. Captain

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.270
To Mr Arseniev

02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:46.960
Your visiting card found
on dead goldi.

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:50.710
Request your presence to identify the body.
Police Headquerters.

02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.150
Mr Arseniev ?

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:17.840
Did you know him ?

02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:20.790
We were friends !

02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.670
And his name was ?

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:37.360
- Dersu Uzala...
- His occupation ?

02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:44.000
- A hunter.
- A hunter. How strange.

02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:46.910
He didn't have a rifle.

02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:52.510
There must have been.
A rifle of the latest model.

02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:55.960
No, nothing was found...

02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:59.230
except your visiting card...

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:04.310
It's clear now :

02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:09.150
the criminal wanted the rifle
so he killed the man.

02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:16.950
- Ready Sir.
- The ground is frozen. It was hard digging the grave.

02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:18.640
Bury him !

02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:47.760
So now I'll ask you to sign.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.830
Beg your pardon. I'm a busy man

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:31.640
Thank you.

02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:36.990
So... May I leave ?

02:11:37.305 --> 02:11:43.469
