WEBVTT

00:36.210 --> 00:41.950
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:52.960 --> 00:54.090
You're here.

00:54.189 --> 00:55.859
What's with the cat?

00:56.799 --> 00:59.299
What do you mean? It's just a cat.

01:00.770 --> 01:01.829
Pretty, isn't it?

01:02.369 --> 01:04.968
Who told you that you can have a cat in our house?

01:05.370 --> 01:08.939
Mr. Chairman bought it for me. I didn't buy it myself.

01:37.340 --> 01:38.469
What's with the cat?

01:40.840 --> 01:41.870
Why is it here?

01:43.640 --> 01:45.340
I asked you a question!

01:50.049 --> 01:53.790
Mr. Chairman gave it to me.

01:54.519 --> 01:56.349
I had no choice but to take it.

01:56.719 --> 01:58.189
Father gave this to you?

01:59.090 --> 02:00.159
Yes.

02:00.459 --> 02:03.189
Father knows that she has cat allergies.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.560
That can't be true.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.269
What do you mean, Ms. Woo?

02:07.469 --> 02:11.000
You would know that I wouldn't tell such a lie about Mr. Chairman.

02:13.909 --> 02:17.280
You should have discussed with us first.

02:18.479 --> 02:20.409
Having a pet is like having a new family member.

02:20.810 --> 02:23.379
You shouldn't make rash decisions like that.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.849
There was no time for discussion.

02:26.319 --> 02:28.189
Mr. Chairman gave it to me.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.889
I wasn't in the position to refuse.

02:30.990 --> 02:34.030
Are you planning on taking the cat when you leave this house?

02:36.430 --> 02:37.430
I guess so.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.370
Very well, then.

02:41.069 --> 02:43.439
Please don't let the cat downstairs.

02:48.939 --> 02:49.939
Okay.

02:59.449 --> 03:00.490
Let's get up.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.979
I despise cats.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.520
Especially that one!

03:30.620 --> 03:33.490
Just for a few days. She says she's going to take it with her.

03:33.719 --> 03:36.120
What is that supposed to mean?

03:36.349 --> 03:37.360
I will make her leave.

03:38.020 --> 03:40.530
I was going to tell you before,

03:40.930 --> 03:42.060
but I didn't have the chance.

03:42.759 --> 03:44.400
She's going to leave by herself?

03:45.900 --> 03:47.099
No way.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.099
There's a reason for her to leave.

03:49.900 --> 03:50.900
What is it?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.000
Forget about it.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.740
Don't worry or you'll get a headache.

03:54.909 --> 03:55.909
I'll take care of it.

03:56.780 --> 03:59.210
I have some herbal medicine for Un Gyu.

03:59.409 --> 04:02.210
I bought it from an herbal clinic recommended by a friend.

04:02.449 --> 04:04.849
This herbal medicine will help him with his college entrance exams.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.550
Aren't you going to tell me?

04:06.789 --> 04:08.419
No prescription is needed for the medicine.

04:09.349 --> 04:12.460
Just take care of Un Gyu. The only thing you should worry about...

04:12.520 --> 04:13.960
is Un Gyu's college education.

04:14.490 --> 04:16.959
She's really going to leave, right? It's true, right?

04:17.129 --> 04:18.160
Yes.

04:18.629 --> 04:21.069
She said that she'll leave after our father's birthday.

04:21.370 --> 04:24.540
I forgot that his birthday is coming soon.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.670
So, just hang in there for a few days.

04:27.610 --> 04:31.009
She makes me uncomfortable in my own house! That woman...

04:33.310 --> 04:34.350
Father...

04:35.410 --> 04:37.220
took care of her debts.

04:38.350 --> 04:39.379
What?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.100
I'm going out.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.769
Yes, ma'am. Take care.

05:08.279 --> 05:09.379
You!

05:10.879 --> 05:14.589
I don't want to see the cat, even in the few days that you're here.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.490
I heard that he took care of your debts.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.860
Since you're leaving soon after his birthday,

05:23.800 --> 05:25.060
I won't say much.

05:28.730 --> 05:29.899
Stop being...

05:32.040 --> 05:33.410
so desperate.

06:29.629 --> 06:31.759
It's late, you can leave now.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.699
The house wasn't properly taken care of while I was away.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.339
There's dust everywhere.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.000
- Do it tomorrow. - I should've taken my daughter...

06:40.110 --> 06:43.170
to a clinic instead of taking care of her myself. I missed out.

06:44.209 --> 06:45.879
Ms. Jo told me...

06:46.279 --> 06:48.250
that the new maid is such a nuisance.

06:48.410 --> 06:50.720
I want to see what she looks like.

06:50.850 --> 06:53.750
- Is she at home? - This isn't the right time.

06:53.990 --> 06:54.990
Go home.

06:55.720 --> 06:59.389
All right, then. I'll clean the bathroom tomorrow.

06:59.459 --> 07:00.529
Okay.

07:01.259 --> 07:02.290
Wait.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.670
- What is this? - Clothes for your grandchildren.

07:07.769 --> 07:09.000
Two of each, since they are twins.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.439
Goodness. How kind of you.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.470
You are so kind to me.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.540
Nothing too expensive. Tell her to not be overwhelmed.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.810
I'll make sure of that. I'll be here early tomorrow.

07:18.910 --> 07:19.939
Bye.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.949
Why a cat all of a sudden?

07:37.600 --> 07:39.329
You're so talented, Ji Hu.

07:39.629 --> 07:41.829
- Should we call it a day? - Okay.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.540
Your father is waiting outside. While I go tell him,

07:46.639 --> 07:49.209
let's put more detail on those fingertips.

07:49.439 --> 07:50.879
- Go on. - Okay.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.519
Did you make it yourself?

07:59.949 --> 08:01.720
- Did you? - There some on your face.

08:01.790 --> 08:02.790
Where?

08:04.220 --> 08:06.160
- Are you okay? - This is not me winking.

08:06.930 --> 08:08.560
It's because I was poked in the eye.

08:08.959 --> 08:10.300
I'm not winking.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.860
- Stop it. - Really.

08:24.509 --> 08:25.740
Ji Hu, let's go home!

08:26.879 --> 08:27.910
Bathroom.

08:28.680 --> 08:29.709
Go on.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.058
Ji Hu, are you listening to music alone?

08:38.659 --> 08:40.330
Let's listen to it together.

08:40.558 --> 08:43.830
You listen to your own music, I'll listen to mine.

08:44.799 --> 08:47.269
Let's not fight over such simple matters.

08:49.269 --> 08:50.899
She's hard to take care of.

08:53.570 --> 08:55.669
It's hard to take care of my own daughter.

08:59.110 --> 09:01.909
- Go on. - Goodness.

09:03.679 --> 09:06.649
Mom. I'm so tired today.

09:06.950 --> 09:08.450
I want to skip writing my English diary.

09:08.750 --> 09:12.289
Okay then. Just write, "today was another day" and go to sleep.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.360
- Goodnight, mom and dad. - Okay.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.960
I'm so tired too. I'm going to sleep.

09:20.370 --> 09:22.169
- Wash first. - Sure.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.340
- Okay? - Okay.

10:14.690 --> 10:18.320
Danger lies to those who have secrets.

10:32.669 --> 10:34.809
- Who is it? - It's me.

10:41.110 --> 10:42.350
What brings you here?

10:42.779 --> 10:44.850
May I come in and talk to you?

10:56.659 --> 10:57.659
Sit.

10:59.899 --> 11:02.899
I came here to get some sleep. What brings you here?

11:03.399 --> 11:05.399
Your husband hired me as a full-time employee.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.340
Thank you.

11:08.070 --> 11:11.340
Good for you. Did you come here to say thank you?

11:12.409 --> 11:13.909
I will keep an eye out for you.

11:14.279 --> 11:16.950
You can bring your boyfriend here. No one will know about it.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.980
You're a funny guy.

11:21.049 --> 11:22.649
What are you doing here?

11:22.720 --> 11:24.190
I felt uncomfortable.

11:24.519 --> 11:27.759
I burdened you with my poor family and my younger brothers.

11:28.429 --> 11:29.789
I need to give something in return.

11:30.230 --> 11:31.700
I will repay you with my service.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.100
What a joke.

11:34.029 --> 11:35.600
Don't ever show your face again.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.899
I have records of him entering the hotel.

11:38.570 --> 11:39.870
I have his cell phone number too.

11:40.940 --> 11:42.570
How dare you.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.679
What are you trying to accomplish? Do you want your life to end?

11:46.710 --> 11:47.809
Don't be mistaken.

11:48.009 --> 11:50.549
I just wanted to say that it doesn't matter whether or not...

11:50.820 --> 11:52.179
if you meet him.

11:53.820 --> 11:55.820
You have no decency.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.519
You should know your place in this world.

11:58.620 --> 11:59.659
Ma'am,

11:59.990 --> 12:03.029
I shall never be a burden to you again.

12:03.759 --> 12:07.230
I will work hard as an employee.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.100
After all you have done?

12:11.769 --> 12:14.639
Anyways, I don't want...

12:15.940 --> 12:17.909
to see you ever again.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.009
Get out!

12:53.210 --> 12:55.610
(Your husband is seeing another woman.)

13:08.960 --> 13:10.059
Take a look at this.

13:11.559 --> 13:13.429
What kind of a person would send such a thing?

13:13.799 --> 13:16.600
This isn't even a scam. What do you make of this?

13:17.639 --> 13:18.740
I have no idea.

13:21.139 --> 13:22.570
Weird.

13:28.580 --> 13:32.120
How do I wash this? Let's see.

13:34.149 --> 13:36.190
It says that I can put this in the washing machine.

13:38.690 --> 13:41.230
Clothes these days have good quality. They don't even smell.

13:46.460 --> 13:50.600
Like clothes hidden in bubbles, secrets that appear hidden...

13:51.669 --> 13:55.539
will be uncovered eventually.

14:04.049 --> 14:06.250
We've become so close with the cat,

14:06.350 --> 14:08.850
how are we supposed to say goodbye?

14:09.250 --> 14:11.059
It hurts my feelings.

14:11.259 --> 14:12.389
The cat isn't going anywhere.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.759
Ms. Park hates cats,

14:16.529 --> 14:18.129
so she wants me to get rid of it.

14:18.230 --> 14:20.330
Who is she to say so?

14:21.129 --> 14:24.139
A cat is no object. Nonsense.

14:32.009 --> 14:34.379
- Hello. - Hello.

14:34.909 --> 14:37.320
I sent you all a message through the group chat. Did you all get it?

14:37.419 --> 14:39.919
- Yes. - Today's topic is "good memories".

14:40.149 --> 14:42.419
Think of one good memory that you have in your life,

14:42.789 --> 14:45.360
share it with the group and show support to others,

14:45.720 --> 14:49.159
so that it could be repeated again.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.759
Have you all brought your "good memory objects"?

14:52.299 --> 14:53.399
Who should we start with?

14:55.230 --> 14:56.399
Let's start with the newcomer.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.139
Good idea.

15:01.110 --> 15:03.710
- I love you. - I love you.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.309
I had a wife.

15:10.820 --> 15:14.090
I met her in freshman year, and we loved each other with passion.

15:15.389 --> 15:17.019
When I first saw her,

15:17.389 --> 15:19.860
she was wearing mittens.

15:21.029 --> 15:24.159
When she took them off, I could see that her hands were so small.

15:25.929 --> 15:28.669
So, I asked her, "Why are your hands so small?" Then she replied,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.070
"Why do you care?"

15:32.639 --> 15:33.769
That's how she replied.

15:36.710 --> 15:40.279
Even today, whenever I see those mittens,

15:41.309 --> 15:42.779
I think of my wife.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.350
- I love you. - I love you.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.289
Next up, A Jin.

15:51.690 --> 15:52.759
I love you all.

15:53.090 --> 15:54.460
- I love you. - I love you.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.500
My dad died when I was eight.

16:02.070 --> 16:05.100
I have two memories of my dad.

16:05.799 --> 16:09.340
When I went to the men's sauna with my dad at age four,

16:10.909 --> 16:12.809
and memories of paper birds.

16:15.279 --> 16:16.509
My dad taught me...

16:17.149 --> 16:19.419
how to make paper birds.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.120
As a seven-year-old, it was difficult for me.

16:25.990 --> 16:29.029
I kept on making mistakes,

16:29.830 --> 16:31.399
so I couldn't make one correctly.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.799
Then I finally managed to make one.

16:37.139 --> 16:38.340
Then my dad said,

16:39.769 --> 16:41.139
"Do you want to see your paper bird

16:41.769 --> 16:44.179
turn into a real one?"

16:45.639 --> 16:46.639
He said that.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.179
But...

16:52.649 --> 16:54.019
I still...

16:55.350 --> 16:57.259
remember how I felt...

16:58.289 --> 16:59.690
after I heard him say that.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.098
I believed...

17:08.098 --> 17:09.230
that my dad...

17:10.240 --> 17:11.299
could really...

17:12.400 --> 17:15.140
turn it into a real bird for me.

17:18.009 --> 17:20.279
To me, he was a father who could do anything for me.

17:23.819 --> 17:26.180
Whenever I see paper birds, I think of my dad.

17:28.490 --> 17:30.789
I feel like it may actually fly.

17:31.920 --> 17:32.960
That's how I feel.

17:36.730 --> 17:38.230
- I love you. - I love you.

17:54.849 --> 17:56.480
What on earth are you doing?

17:58.380 --> 18:00.490
What? Fitness club?

18:02.289 --> 18:05.289
Now that you're well off, you forget who's important.

18:05.390 --> 18:07.130
Shut your mouth.

18:07.829 --> 18:10.630
How dare you accuse me of being a gold digger.

18:11.329 --> 18:14.670
Don't you remember who saved you from those desperate situations?

18:14.799 --> 18:16.069
We went over that already.

18:16.130 --> 18:17.539
You went to jail for me.

18:18.799 --> 18:21.210
That's why I'm trying to return the favor.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.380
Then return the favor,

18:24.480 --> 18:25.880
and stop asking for one.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.579
How much trouble can it be for you to afford a health club?

18:29.650 --> 18:32.849
Ms. Woo knows that I have been to prison.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.519
How did she know?

18:36.960 --> 18:40.529
Anyways, shut your mouth...

18:40.990 --> 18:43.529
and stay low. Okay?

18:49.599 --> 18:50.839
It's delicious.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.140
How come you can cook and be pretty at the same time?

18:53.269 --> 18:54.309
Right?

19:02.049 --> 19:04.480
- Want a bite? - I have a trauma involving gimbap.

19:04.950 --> 19:06.579
Traumas should be overcome.

19:06.650 --> 19:08.190
You are prettier without makeup.

19:11.019 --> 19:14.059
I hope you would stop having any feelings for me.

19:14.230 --> 19:15.329
I'll try.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.000
I like trees.

19:23.170 --> 19:26.369
They don't move an inch, even in rains and storms.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.109
Not moving an inch is a good thing?

19:28.369 --> 19:31.039
Of course. I don't like things that change.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.950
That's why I like trees. They're always at the same spot.

19:34.410 --> 19:35.680
I like flowers.

19:35.980 --> 19:37.480
- Why? - They're pretty.

19:38.619 --> 19:41.349
They have a nice smell and they look pretty.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.660
Just looking at them makes me happy.

19:45.019 --> 19:48.289
"Smell" is a bad choice of words. "Scent" is a better word.

19:48.390 --> 19:49.430
Anyways,

19:50.130 --> 19:51.730
I like how flowers change.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.700
First, they start out as seeds then grow into fruits and leaves,

19:56.230 --> 19:59.039
they bloom and they fade.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.369
But the scent stays the same.

20:06.380 --> 20:09.250
Look at the sky. The sky seems higher than usual,

20:09.410 --> 20:11.150
- don't you think? - You can have it.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.519
Just that part, from there to there.

20:15.390 --> 20:17.019
I'll take it out and give it to you.

20:17.490 --> 20:19.660
The entire sky is mine, actually.

20:21.359 --> 20:23.029
I'll sell it to you piece by piece for free.

20:23.190 --> 20:24.599
Your jokes are lame.

20:26.930 --> 20:30.440
Aren't you giving me any fees?

20:31.539 --> 20:33.539
- What fees? - Sales commission.

20:33.910 --> 20:35.910
I told you that the sky is mine.

20:38.039 --> 20:39.039
Gosh.

20:42.180 --> 20:43.450
Gimbap, open.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.279
Open.

20:48.190 --> 20:49.289
What?

20:59.500 --> 21:01.730
Is that true? Goodness.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.369
Pretend that you don't know and don't meddle in their affairs.

21:04.869 --> 21:06.269
I won't meddle.

21:06.910 --> 21:09.440
I can't believe that woman spoke so highly of herself in front of me.

21:11.079 --> 21:14.250
She's an interesting person, asking such a favor.

21:14.849 --> 21:16.750
She has no boundaries regarding human relationships.

21:18.119 --> 21:22.019
Men will cheat no matter how pretty their wives are.

21:22.750 --> 21:26.019
I made a reservation for lunch, the day after tomorrow.

21:26.730 --> 21:27.730
Yes.

21:30.700 --> 21:34.269
If he lays a hand on you once again, I won't let him get away with it!

21:36.000 --> 21:37.039
Seong Su,

21:38.869 --> 21:39.900
thank you.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.480
That jerk. He should give you more financial support.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Sir.

22:13.539 --> 22:14.539
Sir.

22:15.410 --> 22:16.410
Sir!

22:19.140 --> 22:21.680
- Why? - It seems that you're working hard.

22:25.579 --> 22:27.019
I suggest that you go home and rest.

22:27.650 --> 22:28.750
Which home?

22:41.829 --> 22:44.569
Honey, get up. You need to work out.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.210
Come on, get up.

22:48.269 --> 22:50.210
Stop it!

23:01.349 --> 23:03.150
Get up! There you go.

23:04.059 --> 23:06.619
I don't feel like it. Let me get a day off.

23:06.859 --> 23:08.359
I'll work out twice as hard tomorrow.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.690
Come on, drink.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.329
Are you going to keep on acting like a baby?

23:12.460 --> 23:14.029
- Wait. - Come on, hurry.

23:18.299 --> 23:19.369
Go on.

23:20.069 --> 23:21.369
So cute!

23:22.569 --> 23:23.609
Just once!

23:24.710 --> 23:25.740
Have fun!

24:09.619 --> 24:11.859
Mr. Chairman doesn't like the insides of abalones,

24:12.319 --> 24:13.630
because it tastes fishy.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.630
He will learn to like it from now.

24:51.329 --> 24:56.029
Mr. Chairman, I'll dye your hair for you.

24:56.529 --> 24:58.069
For what?

24:59.200 --> 25:00.710
It'll soon turn white again.

25:00.769 --> 25:02.769
You need to look younger.

25:03.380 --> 25:06.309
You're a man, Mr. Chairman.

25:08.279 --> 25:09.309
All right.

25:10.519 --> 25:11.519
Okay.

25:22.190 --> 25:23.230
Ms. Jo?

25:28.670 --> 25:29.900
Ms. Jo?

25:41.579 --> 25:42.579
Ms. Jo?

26:12.480 --> 26:14.250
The strange thing is that,

26:15.109 --> 26:17.450
she speaks standard language when she's alone with me,

26:17.779 --> 26:21.289
but she speaks a dialect when she's with Mr. Chairman.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.319
And ma'am,

26:25.089 --> 26:28.890
I discovered something while I was cleaning her room.

26:29.960 --> 26:33.130
She threatened me...

26:33.769 --> 26:36.130
never to tell anyone about it.

26:37.970 --> 26:39.869
They were documents that contained personal information...

26:39.970 --> 26:41.970
of Mr. Chairman and your family members.

26:44.109 --> 26:46.509
Tell me more. Documents?

26:46.579 --> 26:48.150
I didn't get a good look at it.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.980
It had information about the size of Mr. Chairman's company.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.049
Mostly about his personal wealth.

26:55.849 --> 26:58.490
In my humble opinion,

26:59.420 --> 27:01.960
I don't think it was coincidence...

27:02.690 --> 27:04.630
that led her to Mr. Chairman.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.970
Understood. You can leave now.

27:14.069 --> 27:17.180
Take this to Pungsuk's Kitchen. It's a list for my father's birthday.

27:17.710 --> 27:20.509
What you told me today,

27:20.950 --> 27:22.779
must be kept as a secret.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.980
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

27:25.079 --> 27:27.920
So, you're telling me that she went there with a clear purpose.

27:27.990 --> 27:30.589
Of course. Why else would she gather such information?

27:31.720 --> 27:33.660
Ms. Woo must be in a tight spot.

27:33.759 --> 27:37.460
But she doesn't stand a chance against Ms. Woo.

27:37.759 --> 27:41.470
- Why is that? - Ms. Woo is a powerful woman.

27:41.569 --> 27:44.039
She's indeed well known for her kindness and education.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.099
Indeed. Actually,

27:46.539 --> 27:48.910
the one who has real control over Mr. Chairman...

27:49.269 --> 27:50.539
is Ms. Woo.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.140
Doesn't matter. She's just a daughter-in-law.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.880
I think Mr. Chairman is already all over Park Bok Ja's bosom.

28:00.049 --> 28:03.920
You don't know how powerful Ms. Woo is.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.029
Is that true?

28:09.359 --> 28:10.359
Yes, Father.

28:10.859 --> 28:13.369
I should have known more before hiring her.

28:14.369 --> 28:15.400
It was my fault.

28:17.839 --> 28:18.869
Unbelievable.

28:19.069 --> 28:21.509
I will make her leave after your birthday tomorrow.

28:26.539 --> 28:27.750
I have something to ask you.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.680
Why did you pay off her debts?

28:33.519 --> 28:36.890
Do you think of her as more than a caregiver?

28:37.259 --> 28:39.059
Why do you care about how I spend my own money?

28:39.390 --> 28:41.130
That's not what I'm trying to say.

28:41.230 --> 28:43.900
Get out. I'm tired of this.

28:49.170 --> 28:50.269
Get some rest.

29:16.490 --> 29:17.730
Get out.

29:27.170 --> 29:28.509
Did you tell her?

29:29.140 --> 29:30.180
Does she know?

29:30.910 --> 29:31.910
To some extent.

29:32.180 --> 29:33.980
I have yet to tell her that I'm going to fire her.

29:36.180 --> 29:39.119
If she realizes what's going on, she'll want to get rid of you.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.190
Probably.

29:43.759 --> 29:46.420
- She lives in Jeju Island? - Who? Un Gyu's parents?

29:46.559 --> 29:47.589
Yes.

29:48.430 --> 29:51.759
Do you know anything about the oldest son, Un Gyu's dad?

29:51.900 --> 29:55.970
He cut ties with Mr. Chairman and was forced to go to the States.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Why did he cut ties?

29:58.099 --> 29:59.299
I don't know.

30:00.109 --> 30:01.970
Don't you know more than I do?

30:02.170 --> 30:04.180
After all, you did all the research.

30:06.750 --> 30:08.279
I heard you're going to leave.

30:09.279 --> 30:12.579
I heard that you're going to leave after Mr. Chairman's birthday.

30:14.950 --> 30:18.289
Since I'm leaving this place against my will,

30:18.759 --> 30:20.490
do you feel you have the right to look down on me?

30:20.589 --> 30:23.730
Gosh, no. Don't be mistaken.

30:24.160 --> 30:27.599
We're both in the same situation, working for people...

30:27.670 --> 30:28.829
Shut your mouth.

30:32.099 --> 30:34.940
That's why you'll never succeed in life.

30:36.039 --> 30:39.210
Why, how rude!

30:39.279 --> 30:42.509
Leeching off other people,

30:42.779 --> 30:44.849
like a parasite.

30:45.519 --> 30:46.789
What did you say?

30:47.690 --> 30:49.950
I had enough of this.

30:50.059 --> 30:51.289
You should get a hold of yourself,

30:51.920 --> 30:54.130
or else you'll be the one walking out of this place.

30:54.630 --> 30:57.130
Your only son made a mistake that resulted in you being in debt.

30:57.200 --> 31:01.200
Your daughter has kidney problems, so she needs to be on dialysis.

31:01.299 --> 31:02.470
Don't you need money?

31:04.140 --> 31:07.170
You know that I did background checks...

31:07.670 --> 31:09.009
on people in this house.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.079
I will never...

31:15.680 --> 31:19.049
leave this house.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.089
So, don't ever look down on me.

31:32.759 --> 31:34.200
You have gotten prettier.

31:35.430 --> 31:37.269
You look like you had a hard time.

31:37.470 --> 31:38.839
Welcome, Jae Hui.

31:39.369 --> 31:42.009
I was going to greet you at the airport, but you wouldn't let me.

31:42.140 --> 31:43.880
No worries. I had no luggage.

31:45.940 --> 31:48.880
- Where's your husband? - He acquired a new company.

31:49.109 --> 31:51.180
He has a lot of work to do, so I came alone.

31:51.549 --> 31:53.390
I wish he had come. I haven't seen him for a while.

31:53.619 --> 31:55.819
That's true. Where's dad?

31:55.920 --> 31:58.359
He's taking a walk with Mr. Kim. He'll be here soon.

31:58.559 --> 32:01.589
Leaving both of you to take care of my sick father...

32:01.829 --> 32:04.529
- You must think I'm a bit rude. - Not at all.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.569
Where's the infamous caregiver?

32:07.930 --> 32:09.029
Let me take a look at her.

32:11.470 --> 32:12.569
Hello, ma'am.

32:13.170 --> 32:14.569
Hello.

32:16.569 --> 32:18.839
She doesn't seem like a type of woman that my dad would like.

32:20.210 --> 32:22.349
You should eat first. You must be starving.

32:23.519 --> 32:25.319
Give up on whatever you're after.

32:26.519 --> 32:28.720
I'm the only one who can ask my dad for support.

32:30.420 --> 32:31.619
Dad!

32:32.589 --> 32:33.660
Dad!

32:34.690 --> 32:37.099
- You're here. - I had a hard time.

32:38.829 --> 32:41.029
- Where's Jae Seok? - He's very busy these days.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.200
He's working hard because of a new product launch.

32:44.269 --> 32:45.569
He also exercises in the morning.

32:45.640 --> 32:48.069
Still, he should say hi to his only sister.

32:48.740 --> 32:51.039
He'll be home soon. My apologies.

32:51.740 --> 32:54.710
What are you apologizing for? He's the one with the problem.

32:56.380 --> 32:58.279
What about my older brother?

33:00.549 --> 33:02.019
Why didn't your husband come?

33:02.789 --> 33:06.160
His business is not going well.

33:07.190 --> 33:08.759
You should invest in his business.

33:09.230 --> 33:11.329
Don't start a business if you're going to ask for my help.

33:11.460 --> 33:12.460
Okay.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.069
Let's talk about this after your birthday.

33:16.269 --> 33:17.599
It's not that I'm asking for a lot.

33:18.140 --> 33:19.740
Two million dollars would be nice.

33:20.309 --> 33:22.609
Kimchi. I was craving for kimchi.

33:25.740 --> 33:26.779
Delicious.

33:54.069 --> 33:55.140
Ta-da!

34:00.950 --> 34:02.680
I can't come tomorrow because of my dad's birthday.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.150
We talked about this already.

34:06.950 --> 34:08.650
Mr. Chairman, it's time to take your medicine.

34:26.039 --> 34:28.070
Do you want to go for a morning walk?

34:28.570 --> 34:31.079
- I can take you. - No. I need to go to work.

34:31.739 --> 34:35.079
I thought you were going stay inside for a week.

34:36.110 --> 34:37.280
Did you change your mind?

34:37.380 --> 34:38.420
Leave me.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.030
Dad!

35:27.969 --> 35:29.900
Let's see if my dad is still sleeping.

35:31.369 --> 35:33.570
Father went to work because of a board meeting.

35:33.940 --> 35:36.239
Gosh. You should have woken me up.

35:36.309 --> 35:37.909
You were in such a deep sleep.

35:38.039 --> 35:40.409
I need my dad to like me.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.719
- Ma'am. - Yes?

35:48.019 --> 35:50.789
Cook some food for me. Let me see how well you cook.

35:51.719 --> 35:53.389
I'm a caregiver.

35:53.489 --> 35:54.530
So what?

35:56.460 --> 35:57.500
I'm not a person...

35:58.329 --> 36:00.929
who does chores around this house.

36:02.699 --> 36:04.800
You follow such strict rules.

36:05.699 --> 36:08.539
I want to see what kind of food...

36:08.610 --> 36:10.409
you serve to my father.

36:11.809 --> 36:14.579
What should I do, Ms. Woo? Do I do it?

36:14.710 --> 36:16.949
No, don't.

36:17.019 --> 36:20.449
- A Jin? - Jae Hui, I'll prepare breakfast.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.489
This woman is fired.

36:23.789 --> 36:25.860
She's still here because of our father's birthday.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.460
It's not her duty to prepare food.

36:29.090 --> 36:30.329
She has no right to do so either.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.730
Come in. I'll prepare food.

36:36.369 --> 36:37.369
Right?

36:55.849 --> 36:58.590
Mr. Chairman, wear this.

37:10.699 --> 37:13.409
Life is a series of choices.

37:17.309 --> 37:18.440
One needs to make choices...

37:18.980 --> 37:21.480
on whether to accept or let go.

37:23.380 --> 37:26.519
One needs to make choices...

37:26.619 --> 37:28.050
to be chosen.

37:31.860 --> 37:32.860
This shirt...

37:34.889 --> 37:35.960
and this tie.

37:40.199 --> 37:42.230
Jae Seok Ahn, you're so handsome.

37:42.369 --> 37:44.300
Of course, I am.

37:44.739 --> 37:47.409
I'm the son of my beautiful mother. I resemble her.

37:48.110 --> 37:50.610
Your sister is waiting for you. Call her at least.

37:50.710 --> 37:54.250
I hate her so much. We always fight within 30 minutes of talking.

37:55.150 --> 37:58.349
Oh, I heard that you had food with a young girl at a café.

37:58.619 --> 37:59.780
I caught you red-handed!

38:00.449 --> 38:01.489
What?

38:01.889 --> 38:04.360
I heard you had food at a café in Chungdam-dong. Who was it?

38:04.860 --> 38:06.190
It's probably a mistake.

38:06.289 --> 38:08.730
I'm really busy these days because of the new product launch.

38:09.159 --> 38:11.400
Something smells fishy. Someone told me you were at Take Two.

38:11.559 --> 38:13.099
That’s the café you normally go to, right.

38:14.369 --> 38:16.130
Oh, that girl.

38:16.800 --> 38:20.610
She's from the female pad marketing department.

38:21.210 --> 38:22.739
I needed her advice.

38:23.579 --> 38:26.610
She had to make a decision.

38:28.110 --> 38:31.550
Well, I guess there's nothing wrong about that.

38:31.780 --> 38:35.449
Her decision was to trust him.

38:37.659 --> 38:39.590
Work hard so that father likes you.

38:40.159 --> 38:41.190
Don't worry.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.539
Your handkerchief, honey!

38:51.469 --> 38:54.309
We have started up the Chinese factories...

38:54.409 --> 38:56.469
for our new product launch,

38:56.610 --> 38:58.809
and all product lines have been examined.

38:59.610 --> 39:01.679
We should stop using brightening agents,

39:01.780 --> 39:04.780
and increase the price of our products.

39:04.980 --> 39:08.389
If brightening agents become a problem,

39:08.489 --> 39:10.860
it may hurt our sanitary pad sales. That's all.

39:12.219 --> 39:14.090
Okay. Do what you have to do.

39:15.090 --> 39:17.130
You can leave if there's nothing else to discuss.

39:26.539 --> 39:27.639
You leave too.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.409
Mr. Chairman...

39:31.239 --> 39:32.239
I mean, Dad.

39:32.980 --> 39:34.510
About that woman...

39:34.909 --> 39:36.349
I should meet her in person.

39:36.820 --> 39:38.650
- No need. - Why?

39:39.780 --> 39:40.789
You're making her leave?

39:47.030 --> 39:48.260
I heard...

39:49.760 --> 39:51.260
you slept together.

39:53.030 --> 39:55.900
A man shouldn't do that to a woman.

39:55.969 --> 39:57.969
- How rude... - I'll come over today to say hi.

39:58.070 --> 39:59.539
I said there's no need.

39:59.599 --> 40:03.210
Why won't anyone let me say hi to her?

40:03.269 --> 40:05.610
It's not like we're Romeo and Juliet.

40:05.679 --> 40:07.809
Go away, get out.

40:09.780 --> 40:12.920
Why are you throwing this masterpiece?

40:13.179 --> 40:14.349
What's this?

40:14.449 --> 40:18.119
There should be noble art on this, not some kind of a cartoon.

40:19.219 --> 40:22.829
Talk about your standards! How do you call this a cartoon?

40:23.400 --> 40:26.500
It's by an artist who'll become the greatest of pop art.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.570
Cartoon?

40:29.869 --> 40:30.900
Get out!

40:32.800 --> 40:33.869
Yes, sir.

40:36.739 --> 40:37.739
Goodbye.

40:40.449 --> 40:43.679
You should have let your teacher come. Why do you insist on going?

40:44.019 --> 40:46.050
Your teacher said that she'll come to teach.

40:46.690 --> 40:48.150
I have clear reasons.

40:48.789 --> 40:50.320
- What is it? - First,

40:51.019 --> 40:54.690
I can hear more clearly in the lesson room than at home.

40:55.159 --> 40:58.800
Second, I like talking to you in the car.

40:59.230 --> 41:02.530
I don't get the chance to see you if she comes.

41:02.769 --> 41:04.969
Is that so?

41:05.269 --> 41:06.269
How cute!

41:07.739 --> 41:09.269
As I was saying,

41:09.940 --> 41:12.309
I want you to pick me up after my art class.

41:12.510 --> 41:14.949
- Not dad. - Why?

41:15.480 --> 41:17.650
I told you. I like talking to you.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.719
You're not telling me that you like me more than your dad, are you?

41:21.849 --> 41:23.760
Of course not.

41:24.659 --> 41:27.260
Anyways, I want you to come. Don't let dad come.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.059
Dad wants to pick you up.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.400
I think he's using her art for one of his products.

41:33.869 --> 41:35.769
Maybe he found an interest in art.

41:36.099 --> 41:38.070
Dad? Art?

41:38.699 --> 41:39.769
Yes.

41:47.980 --> 41:50.980
You can teach in one of the three homes month-by-month in a rotation.

41:57.860 --> 42:00.489
Wear the underwear I bought for you tomorrow.

42:03.900 --> 42:06.000
(Your husband is seeing another woman.)

42:07.599 --> 42:09.599
800 is a fair deal, don't you think?

42:11.639 --> 42:13.369
That's once a week.

42:13.670 --> 42:16.639
I think we can just meet over there from now on.

42:20.780 --> 42:22.949
Hey, where are the lotus root pickles?

42:23.110 --> 42:24.280
In fridge number two.

42:24.519 --> 42:26.219
- Please hurry and pack that up. - Yes, ma'am.

42:30.159 --> 42:32.219
- Almost done? - Almost.

42:33.429 --> 42:36.329
- Delicious! - Eating before Mr. Chairman. Rude!

42:36.429 --> 42:38.960
She says she'll never leave. Not over her dead body!

42:39.159 --> 42:41.769
Ms. Woo told her to leave. How can she not?

42:41.869 --> 42:44.039
You don't know what kind of a woman she is.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.909
What a disaster.

42:46.969 --> 42:50.079
Now let's all head to Mr. Chairman's place!

43:06.059 --> 43:07.530
It's ready.

43:09.789 --> 43:10.829
Mr. Chairman,

43:11.929 --> 43:14.070
aren't you feeling happy that your daughter is here?

43:17.199 --> 43:20.969
I told you that I'd dye your hair.

43:21.969 --> 43:24.280
- Let's do it now. - No need.

43:24.340 --> 43:26.849
I'll do it for you. For your birthday.

43:27.079 --> 43:28.210
I said, no need.

43:30.219 --> 43:32.380
There's something I need to tell you too.

43:37.559 --> 43:38.889
I had a daughter.

43:40.489 --> 43:42.230
I raised her by myself.

43:43.559 --> 43:45.599
But seven years ago,

43:46.900 --> 43:48.599
she developed leukemia.

43:50.570 --> 43:52.639
I needed 60,000 dollars...

43:53.539 --> 43:56.369
to pay for her bone marrow transplant.

43:58.909 --> 44:00.280
I didn't even have...

44:01.579 --> 44:03.210
60 dollars.

44:04.619 --> 44:06.650
I had no choice.

44:10.190 --> 44:11.960
That's why I did it.

44:13.590 --> 44:16.329
I did what...

44:17.860 --> 44:19.000
was forbidden.

44:20.199 --> 44:24.039
So, I ended up in prison.

44:25.739 --> 44:28.070
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

44:29.340 --> 44:30.579
How can I possibly...

44:32.409 --> 44:34.449
tell you such a thing?

44:41.119 --> 44:42.119
Mr. Chairman,

44:45.460 --> 44:46.860
stay healthy.

44:48.730 --> 44:51.059
I know that I'm leaving,

44:52.429 --> 44:55.570
but I'll pay you back my debts.

44:58.139 --> 45:01.309
You don't need to.

45:02.469 --> 45:03.610
Yes, I do.

45:04.980 --> 45:06.239
I cannot...

45:06.750 --> 45:09.809
accept such generosity...

45:10.320 --> 45:12.320
for free.

45:29.869 --> 45:31.139
Let's go!

45:32.900 --> 45:33.940
You're here, sister.

45:34.340 --> 45:35.610
Long time no see.

45:37.110 --> 45:38.409
How have you been, Ji Hu?

45:38.639 --> 45:40.510
- Hi, ma'am. - Hi.

45:51.159 --> 45:52.389
I'm so hungry.

45:52.489 --> 45:54.989
- Oh no. You should eat. - Is there anything to eat here?

45:55.659 --> 45:57.730
Come on, stop eating.

45:57.829 --> 46:00.130
Ji Hu, did you take a picture of me eating?

46:00.429 --> 46:03.269
- Stop it. - She doesn't want you to do it.

46:03.570 --> 46:04.599
Hey.

46:06.300 --> 46:07.369
Goodness.

46:07.809 --> 46:08.840
Mr. Chairman,

46:10.239 --> 46:12.480
you look like an unmarried young man.

46:16.010 --> 46:18.849
I'm going to change first.

46:19.519 --> 46:22.389
Everybody is waiting for you. You should head out.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.699
Father's here.

46:31.860 --> 46:32.860
Father!

46:34.000 --> 46:35.030
Happy birthday!

46:36.400 --> 46:38.440
- Happy birthday! - Thank you. Sit down.

46:38.539 --> 46:39.739
- Sit down. - Happy birthday.

46:43.070 --> 46:45.239
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

46:45.409 --> 46:46.750
- Happy birthday. - Thank you.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.980
When did you prepare all this?

47:24.320 --> 47:25.880
This is nothing, father.

47:28.050 --> 47:29.050
By the way,

47:29.550 --> 47:32.190
I don't see the caregiver who follows strict rules.

47:32.559 --> 47:33.659
Is she fired already?

48:01.190 --> 48:02.190
Oh gosh.

48:02.489 --> 48:06.389
I cooked a dish that you like the most.

48:06.519 --> 48:08.429
How dare you bring such an inelegant food!

48:08.530 --> 48:10.099
Pigskins are inelegant?

48:11.059 --> 48:12.730
What's the point of elegance in food?

48:16.800 --> 48:17.840
Unbelievable.

48:18.070 --> 48:19.570
I can't believe this woman.

48:23.010 --> 48:24.010
Mr. Chairman,

48:25.340 --> 48:27.610
open your mouth.

48:30.380 --> 48:32.019
Father, I want some too.

48:32.079 --> 48:33.320
Stop it.

48:34.489 --> 48:36.989
Have a seat. Don't just stand there.

48:39.760 --> 48:40.789
Sit down.

48:44.059 --> 48:45.099
Okay.

49:12.289 --> 49:13.530
- Gosh! - Oh my!

49:20.400 --> 49:22.230
Mr. Chairman!

49:25.000 --> 49:26.300
Dad!

49:26.639 --> 49:27.940
Gosh!

49:28.440 --> 49:30.639
She really did overreact just now.

49:31.340 --> 49:33.349
She almost killed father on his own birthday.

49:33.510 --> 49:36.679
What did you just say?

49:36.849 --> 49:38.019
Am I wrong?

49:38.449 --> 49:40.719
What's the big deal about a cat?

49:43.219 --> 49:47.289
Unbelievable how she threw herself to protect him.

49:47.760 --> 49:48.929
"Oh, Mr. Chairman!"

49:49.030 --> 49:50.860
She still has to leave the house.

49:51.059 --> 49:53.800
Who said she shouldn't? Of course. I agree.

49:53.900 --> 49:57.400
Still searching for a replacement. I'll take care of him before then.

49:58.940 --> 50:00.940
Will he accept that?

50:04.679 --> 50:05.739
Father.

50:07.449 --> 50:08.579
She's not leaving!

50:09.110 --> 50:10.179
Didn't you see her...

50:11.019 --> 50:12.849
sacrificing herself to save me?

50:14.090 --> 50:16.190
Can any of you do that for me?

50:16.619 --> 50:18.019
Tell me!

50:18.289 --> 50:20.429
Father, this is unacceptable.

50:20.690 --> 50:22.159
She cannot stay here.

50:50.489 --> 50:51.659
Dad?

50:55.659 --> 50:58.760
She's the one who made me walk.

50:59.659 --> 51:01.969
Do you see? Do you?

51:02.699 --> 51:05.070
I'm standing...

51:07.039 --> 51:08.070
and walking!

51:09.440 --> 51:10.440
You see?

51:44.579 --> 51:45.579
You.

51:46.409 --> 51:47.780
Let's pull off a performance.

51:52.650 --> 51:54.519
Just a little bit more inward.

51:55.619 --> 51:57.659
There're going to be 1, 2...

52:23.579 --> 52:25.880
What's the big deal about a criminal record? She served time.

52:26.690 --> 52:27.690
What?

52:27.889 --> 52:30.360
Practically speaking, my friend has a criminal record for fraud.

52:30.460 --> 52:32.090
Crimes that involve money are petty crimes.

52:32.190 --> 52:35.730
What's the big deal? Are you serious?

52:35.889 --> 52:38.429
Ex-criminals are entitled to opportunities too.

52:38.530 --> 52:40.829
What would they do if the whole society deprives them?

52:41.070 --> 52:44.300
I can't believe this. You should be friends with Jesus.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.269
No. He's not my type. He has no sense of humor.

52:48.309 --> 52:51.110
He stood up. She made a man rise.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.309
That's important.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.010
Go to sleep. This is going nowhere.

52:55.110 --> 52:57.380
Just about to. I'm so tired.

54:50.400 --> 54:51.400
Cat!

54:54.730 --> 54:55.730
Cat!

54:57.369 --> 54:58.400
Cat!

55:01.110 --> 55:02.139
Cat!

55:05.340 --> 55:06.380
Cat!

55:12.349 --> 55:13.389
Cat!

55:27.530 --> 55:28.570
Cat!

55:31.869 --> 55:32.869
Cat!

55:34.610 --> 55:36.440
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

55:37.710 --> 55:38.710
Cat!

55:40.849 --> 55:41.849
Cat!

55:42.250 --> 55:43.349
It's not here.

55:47.250 --> 55:48.619
I got rid of it.

55:54.289 --> 55:57.829
Cat!

55:58.230 --> 55:59.260
Cat!

56:01.530 --> 56:03.769
Cat!

56:04.800 --> 56:05.800
Cat!

56:09.440 --> 56:10.710
Cat!

56:11.610 --> 56:12.710
Cat!

56:19.480 --> 56:21.489
Cat!

56:22.719 --> 56:23.789
Cat!

57:05.530 --> 57:06.530
You.

57:07.800 --> 57:08.800
Get out!

57:34.989 --> 57:35.989
Un Gyu!

57:37.699 --> 57:38.829
Ma'am.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.329
What do you think you're doing?

58:11.199 --> 58:12.559
You're here.

58:12.659 --> 58:14.530
I asked you a question!

58:16.570 --> 58:19.670
Un Gyu, what is going on? When did you go out?

58:19.800 --> 58:22.639
Explain yourself in detail.

58:25.409 --> 58:28.710
What did I do wrong, Ms. Woo?

58:30.820 --> 58:31.880
Don't you know?

58:31.980 --> 58:33.250
What's going on?

58:33.650 --> 58:35.050
An eye for an eye,

58:36.420 --> 58:37.820
a tooth for a tooth.

58:39.519 --> 58:41.690
She got rid of my baby,

58:42.159 --> 58:43.599
so I got rid of hers.

58:44.230 --> 58:45.699
You...

58:46.800 --> 58:48.570
Stop it!

58:49.800 --> 58:51.900
Before you embarrass yourself in front of your son.

58:51.969 --> 58:53.000
Park Bok Ja!

58:55.469 --> 58:56.469
Stop!

58:58.440 --> 58:59.480
Stop this at once!

59:00.010 --> 59:01.610
If I had stopped,

59:07.849 --> 59:09.920
just like she said,

59:11.690 --> 59:15.530
would I be alive?

59:16.460 --> 59:17.699
Stop!

59:21.230 --> 59:23.070
Stop this at once!

59:47.630 --> 59:50.030
(The Lady in Dignity)

59:51.900 --> 59:55.769
I will never leave this house.

59:55.869 --> 59:57.239
Ju Mi!

59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.769
How are you planning on dealing with Mr. Chairman...

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.940
if I leave?

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.480
Crazy woman.

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:09.880
He works out every day, early in the morning.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.980
Are you seeing the artist who draws these cartoons?

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.989
What's a big deal about a kiss?

01:00:16.219 --> 01:00:17.559
Don't you think it's strange?

01:00:17.659 --> 01:00:19.590
- It's strange, indeed. - Ma'am.

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:20.929
Mr. Chairman, are you all right?

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:22.559
Do you want to live together,

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:25.130
as husband and wife?

01:00:25.599 --> 01:00:27.969
I will only listen to you,

01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:30.440
not anyone else.

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.070
She was an orphan.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.570
She was adopted at age 10, but she was returned for some reason.

01:00:36.639 --> 01:00:37.909
What is that you want?

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.579
Tell me what you want.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.880
What I want is...
