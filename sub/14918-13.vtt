WEBVTT

00:01.454 --> 00:03.619
- This is our third morning coffee date in a row.
- I know.

00:03.619 --> 00:06.199
- It's gotta stop.
- It's like the secret life of carpoolers.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.037
Honestly, the food's better
re than at my place right now.

00:10.037 --> 00:11.929
Unless you like hamburger helper.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.928
That's all coop eats right now.

00:13.928 --> 00:15.713
I'm more of a fish sticks guy myself.

00:15.713 --> 00:18.528
Well, I wish I could get
Paige to eat fish sticks.

00:18.528 --> 00:20.462
We had this massive showdown last week.

00:20.496 --> 00:22.330
She declared herself a vegan.

00:22.365 --> 00:24.733
I said, "no, no, no."

00:24.767 --> 00:27.495
I negotiated her back up
to a vegetarian. So she's,

00:27.495 --> 00:29.215
uh, 12 going on junior at Berkeley.

00:29.215 --> 00:32.616
Yes. It's not that I don't
support her moral choice.

00:32.652 --> 00:35.587
I just... I don't know what to feed her.

00:35.621 --> 00:38.857
The latest battle... she, uh...

00:38.891 --> 00:40.948
- she wants a tattoo.
- What?

00:40.948 --> 00:42.865
- She wants a tattoo.
- She's 12.

00:43.863 --> 00:44.734
- Yes.
- The... oh, my goodness.

00:44.734 --> 00:45.899
And Paige's thing... she's just...

00:45.899 --> 00:48.200
she's always pitting me
and Joe against each other.

00:48.234 --> 00:50.177
- It's driving me nuts.
- Oh, yeah. My ex and I

00:50.178 --> 00:51.503
we had to nip that in the bud.

00:52.228 --> 00:54.531
It's called, uh, the circle of trust.

00:54.531 --> 00:56.898
And I... I know it sounds very 1960s,

00:56.898 --> 00:58.765
but every drop-off and pickup,

00:58.799 --> 01:01.668
we have a family chat
about where everybody's at.

01:01.702 --> 01:04.437
You know, it works. It's
all about, uh, transparency.

01:05.154 --> 01:06.406
Transparency. Wow.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.942
Where have you been all my life?

01:08.976 --> 01:12.679
Well, maybe it's good we're meeting now.

01:15.213 --> 01:16.214
What are you doing tonight?

01:16.851 --> 01:19.886
Your kids are with their dad.
My kids are with their mom.

01:19.921 --> 01:21.352
- I'll bring the fish sticks.
- I'm sorry.

01:21.353 --> 01:23.525
I... I invited my
sister Kitty for dinner,

01:23.525 --> 01:24.591
and her husband.

01:24.625 --> 01:28.128
- Another time.
- But you should come, please.

01:28.162 --> 01:29.642
- Okay.
- Except my mother is gonna be there.

01:29.642 --> 01:31.048
And I work with my uncle Saul.

01:31.048 --> 01:32.584
He got wind of it, so he's coming.

01:32.652 --> 01:35.151
And my brother Kevin is
bringing his husband Scotty

01:35.151 --> 01:36.630
once they knock up the surrogate.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.536
Uh, it's a big family dinner.
It sounds like fun to me.

01:39.536 --> 01:43.977
It's not too late to say no.
It's a hell of a lot of Walker.

01:44.011 --> 01:46.713
I'm a big boy. I can
take care of myself.

01:46.747 --> 01:48.815
I bet you can.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.831
We had to do this on a Saturday?

01:51.831 --> 01:53.799
I mean, isn't this
just a little bit early

01:53.833 --> 01:55.901
in the election cycle to
be having this meeting?

01:55.936 --> 01:57.805
Actually, they've been trying
to talk to you for a while.

01:57.805 --> 01:59.556
We're only ten months
out from reelection,

01:59.556 --> 02:00.992
which means you need to start doing

02:00.992 --> 02:04.367
- at least four fund-raisers a
week, every week. - Oh, come on, Joe.

02:04.367 --> 02:06.098
I don't even have a
challenger in the primary.

02:06.098 --> 02:09.174
Senator, I've been raising
money for you for a lot of years.

02:09.174 --> 02:11.576
You just... you never know
who's coming up from behind you.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.578
You know the game. The game.

02:13.612 --> 02:16.147
Robert, it's not that bad.
We can make our monthly quotes

02:16.181 --> 02:18.583
with an event at 500 bucks a ticket.

02:18.617 --> 02:20.551
Why don't they just
put me in the dump tank

02:20.551 --> 02:21.685
- and have 'em throw beanbags at me?
- Look,

02:21.685 --> 02:23.451
kid around all you want,
but we're not liking

02:23.451 --> 02:24.758
how the opposition looks in November.

02:24.758 --> 02:26.797
Yeah, they've got some strong guys,

02:26.825 --> 02:29.427
but at the end of the day, the
liberals are gonna fade away

02:29.461 --> 02:30.580
- and they're gonna run Velasquez.
- And that's why

02:30.580 --> 02:33.097
we're thinking, make a
move with Hispanics now

02:33.132 --> 02:33.695
while it's still early.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.925
Get your hands in their
pockets before the Democrats

02:35.925 --> 02:41.484
- start making 'em cry over immigration.
- You guys are unbelievable.

02:41.484 --> 02:45.119
Look, I have my feelers
out to this, uh... Shakira.

02:45.119 --> 02:48.021
Outdoor concert... you rent
a couple of porta-potties,

02:48.021 --> 02:50.024
and bingo... you pull in
a couple hundred grand,

02:50.024 --> 02:51.482
and you'll look golden
with the Mexicans.

02:53.744 --> 02:56.354
Okay, first of all,
Shakira is from Colombia.

02:56.388 --> 02:58.908
And before we go pandering
to Mexican-Americans

02:58.908 --> 03:01.417
or anybody else... it's not how
I want to deliver my message.

03:01.417 --> 03:03.895
And it's definitely not
how I want to spend my time

03:03.929 --> 03:06.931
in the senate. But, uh, you're
still gonna need to get the money

03:06.965 --> 03:08.530
to get the message out there,
however you want to do it.

03:08.531 --> 03:09.901
Okay, enough. Listen,
let's table this discussion

03:09.935 --> 03:12.503
before I say something
you're not gonna want to hear.

03:12.538 --> 03:14.505
Robert, y... you own
this seat. It's just...

03:14.540 --> 03:17.041
we just have to look ahead.
That's all I'm saying.

03:17.076 --> 03:19.744
Joe, nobody owns a senate seat. Okay?

03:19.778 --> 03:22.847
All right. I'll talk to you this week.

03:22.881 --> 03:25.950
I'll let you go back
to it. But next week.

03:25.984 --> 03:28.319
Thanks, Joe.

03:30.723 --> 03:32.990
Aren't you supposed to be
at the fertility clinic?

03:33.025 --> 03:34.692
Yeah.

03:34.727 --> 03:38.162
Go. Go... make a baby.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.106
Will you please come over here?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.141
I can't see you back there.

03:50.175 --> 03:53.044
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to be respectful

03:53.078 --> 03:56.814
of your, um, you know, lady parts.

03:56.849 --> 03:59.016
"Lady parts"? Is he joking?

03:59.051 --> 04:00.651
No. If we become parents,

04:00.686 --> 04:02.587
you will say "penis" and "vagina,"

04:02.621 --> 04:04.088
not "licorice" and "lady parts."

04:06.835 --> 04:08.359
- Hey, mom.
- Look, I just wanted to tell you,

04:08.394 --> 04:09.861
I'm thinking about you

04:09.895 --> 04:11.863
and I'm sending you very strong vibes.

04:11.897 --> 04:14.165
Oh. I think it's a little weird

04:14.199 --> 04:16.500
to have your mom in the
room during conception.

04:16.567 --> 04:19.137
- Hey, guys.
- Uh, the doctor's here. Bye.

04:19.879 --> 04:21.005
Ooh, he's very nervous.

04:21.039 --> 04:23.388
Mom, I can't find your bundt pan.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.041
Do you still have I it's right there.

04:24.076 --> 04:26.878
Right in front of your face,
right next to the jell-o mold.

04:26.912 --> 04:29.247
- Got it.
- You're making a bundt cake?

04:29.281 --> 04:31.616
Mm-hmm. And drunken pork.

04:31.650 --> 04:34.897
Ooh. Drunken pork and a bundt cake.

04:34.897 --> 04:36.031
You know what? You don't have to come.

04:36.031 --> 04:37.970
If you want to change your
mind, that's absolutely fine.

04:37.971 --> 04:39.624
No, no. I want to meet this guy.

04:39.658 --> 04:42.636
I have never seen you
so totally... aflutter.

04:42.636 --> 04:44.545
Oh, come on. I'm not aflutter.

04:44.545 --> 04:47.381
Just, um... optimistic.

04:47.381 --> 04:49.364
Optimistic is what the weatherman is.

04:49.364 --> 04:51.932
- No, you're aflutter. Admit it.
- Okay, I admit it.

04:51.966 --> 04:53.900
I admit it. I am. I'm aflutter.

04:53.935 --> 04:56.770
Mom, this guy's incredible.
He wakes up in the morning,

04:56.804 --> 04:58.045
and he actually leaves the house.

04:58.045 --> 05:00.848
He is sharp. He's organized.
He runs his own business.

05:00.848 --> 05:03.022
He understands what it's
like to be a single parent.

05:03.647 --> 05:06.147
- He's a grown-up. -
Yeah, in other words,

05:06.148 --> 05:07.381
he's everything Luc wasn't.

05:07.415 --> 05:10.117
Oh, don't stop there.
What about my ex-husband?

05:10.151 --> 05:12.085
This is a sea change for me.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.855
- Well, I can't wait to meet him.
- Okay, I gotta get going.

05:14.889 --> 05:16.857
I got a hundred things to pick up,

05:16.891 --> 05:18.177
and I still have to stop by at Ojai.

05:18.177 --> 05:21.595
- Ojai? Why? It's Saturday.
- Oh, God, mom. Uncle Saul...

05:21.629 --> 05:25.565
He filed the quarterly taxes
before he did the payroll taxes,

05:25.600 --> 05:27.634
which leaves us wide open to an audit.

05:27.669 --> 05:29.903
- I gotta go fix it up.
- Well, ask Saul to do it.

05:29.937 --> 05:31.371
Yeah.

05:31.406 --> 05:34.341
The thing is, uncle Saul's
been so cranky lately.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.310
It's better I do it myself.

05:36.344 --> 05:38.578
I hope he's all right. I
haven't spoken to him in weeks,

05:38.613 --> 05:40.080
which is strange in itself.

05:40.114 --> 05:42.149
Mom, I am actually a
little worried about him.

05:42.183 --> 05:44.184
He's been at Ojai so long.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.520
He might just be burnt out.

05:47.922 --> 05:50.023
Well, look, you're busy. I'll do it.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.426
- What, talk to Saul?
- Well, I'll do that later.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.528
First I'll go to Ojai,
refile your 1120 form

05:54.562 --> 05:56.129
and fix your taxes.

05:56.164 --> 05:58.999
Listen to you. "Refile the 1120 form."

05:59.033 --> 06:00.967
You know what? In the old days of Ojai,

06:01.002 --> 06:03.270
bookkeeping was a one-woman show...

06:04.639 --> 06:06.042
would you please just let me handle it?

06:06.042 --> 06:08.909
Okay. Go for it.

06:08.943 --> 06:10.644
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

06:10.678 --> 06:11.466
No, thank you.

06:11.951 --> 06:14.715
Remember the first
time we went to D.C....

06:14.749 --> 06:16.583
that wingding for college Republicans?

06:16.617 --> 06:19.653
Yes, and we thought it
was a Halloween party...

06:19.687 --> 06:22.255
and I wore a bunny suit.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.982
- And I dressed as a stripper.
- And the only

06:23.983 --> 06:25.592
reason you got a job in the White House

06:25.626 --> 06:28.128
- was because of
that G-string. - Hey.

06:28.162 --> 06:31.298
Hey. If you got it, flaunt it.

06:31.332 --> 06:34.067
Okay. I need a little intel.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.669
What's your husband meaning to do?

06:35.703 --> 06:37.904
Primary's coming right up,

06:37.939 --> 06:39.873
and he has not announced for reelection.

06:39.907 --> 06:43.176
- America needs to know.
- I wish I knew myself.

06:43.211 --> 06:46.713
Well, join the club.

06:46.748 --> 06:48.715
Nobody can say boo until he decides.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.051
I have got players stacked
up from here to San Francisco

06:51.085 --> 06:53.120
- just waiting on him.
- Who are we talking about?

06:53.154 --> 06:55.088
Diaz, Barry Dececco

06:55.123 --> 06:57.023
and, oh, you know Hargrove?

06:57.058 --> 06:59.326
Kinky Bob?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.995
Yeah. You can't put him over.
He's got stuff on the Internet.

07:02.029 --> 07:04.464
His wife did take him back.

07:04.499 --> 07:06.233
Well...

07:06.267 --> 07:08.201
What about Holtzman in the 54th?

07:08.236 --> 07:09.656
I hear that he's on his way out.

07:09.656 --> 07:12.774
Yeah, he is flopping like
a catfish on dry land.

07:12.774 --> 07:14.794
I could probably get somebody in there.

07:14.794 --> 07:17.444
Really?

07:17.478 --> 07:19.112
Well, who's... who's interested?

07:19.147 --> 07:21.581
A lot of people. Why?

07:21.616 --> 07:23.817
Oh, no. No. Um, I'm just curious.

07:23.851 --> 07:25.122
No reason.

07:25.122 --> 07:26.202
No reason?

07:28.156 --> 07:31.792
Kitty McCallister...

07:31.826 --> 07:34.094
It's you. Shh.

07:34.128 --> 07:36.196
Shh, shh, shh. Oh, my...

07:36.230 --> 07:38.165
No, shh, shh. Oh.

07:38.199 --> 07:41.034
No, no. I... I don't know
yet. It's complicated.

07:41.068 --> 07:43.804
I have a baby. My
marriage is going great.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.788
I just... I don't know
why I just said that.

07:45.789 --> 07:47.274
Ooh, you would kill in the 54th.

07:47.308 --> 07:50.177
Your cancer... we don't even
have to focus group that.

07:50.211 --> 07:52.712
- Women love you.
- No, I do not want to run on lymphoma.

07:52.747 --> 07:55.115
I want to run on what I
can do for other people,

07:55.149 --> 07:57.317
not on what happened to me,

07:57.351 --> 07:59.786
if... if I even decide to do it.

07:59.821 --> 08:01.588
I... hey.

08:01.622 --> 08:03.590
I don't want to hear "if."

08:03.624 --> 08:07.694
Kitty McCallister for
congress in California's 54th.

08:07.728 --> 08:10.197
What took you so long?

08:14.635 --> 08:15.702
Surprise.

08:15.736 --> 08:17.170
Hey.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.740
It's your loving, supportive
wife bringing you lunch.

08:20.775 --> 08:22.275
What's that?

08:22.310 --> 08:24.744
Oh, well, it's Saturday.

08:24.779 --> 08:27.180
You had a meeting with Joe Corvus.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.816
You know, if I had a
meeting with Joe Corvus,

08:29.851 --> 08:31.952
I think that I would be drinking vodka.

08:31.986 --> 08:35.087
So what did he have for
you, meet and greets?

08:35.121 --> 08:36.849
- You don't want to know.
- Honey, you know what?

08:36.850 --> 08:37.924
Nobody wants to raise money,

08:37.958 --> 08:39.481
but, you know, primary
season is revving up.

08:39.482 --> 08:40.727
And every dirt bag and money-grubber

08:40.760 --> 08:42.729
comes marching right
out of the woodwork.

08:42.763 --> 08:44.058
It does seem to get worse every year.

08:44.058 --> 08:45.565
Now it's to the point
where you get elected

08:45.600 --> 08:48.034
to go to work for the
people who sent you there,

08:48.069 --> 08:50.737
and instead, you gotta turn right around
and go to work on getting elect again.

08:50.771 --> 08:52.142
Yeah, well, it isn't a perfect system,

08:52.142 --> 08:56.710
- but it is the one we have.
- And the endless gridlock...

08:56.744 --> 08:58.290
Now look, I brought you
turkey on rye with spicy...

08:58.291 --> 08:59.713
and the name taking and
score keeping, and I...

08:59.747 --> 09:02.150
look, I don't have anything
against the people who do it,

09:02.150 --> 09:03.970
I just don't want to
work that way, you know?

09:03.970 --> 09:05.600
I... I want to... I want
to do something real.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.760
I want to be able to
point to something and say,

09:07.760 --> 09:09.614
- "see that? I did that."
- Well, there are

09:09.614 --> 09:11.825
tons of things that you can point to...

09:11.859 --> 09:13.143
I mean, what if you, Evan
and I started a foundation,

09:13.143 --> 09:15.418
and... and we went to
Africa and we brought water

09:15.418 --> 09:18.034
- and we brought doctors to people who needed it?
- Yeah,

09:18.034 --> 09:19.429
of course. I mean,
that would be wonderful.

09:19.429 --> 09:22.135
- But... but maybe someday, we... we...
- And... and... and when? When?

09:22.135 --> 09:24.117
I mean, here comes another election.

09:24.117 --> 09:26.940
And I'm running and I'm running
and... and where am I going?

09:27.637 --> 09:30.074
I mean, in the last four
years, I've run for president,

09:30.074 --> 09:31.896
- I've run for governor.
- I know, but you're a senator.

09:32.487 --> 09:34.288
Okay, you love being a senator.

09:34.288 --> 09:36.894
I love the work. I
hate the crap around it.

09:39.462 --> 09:42.160
Are you... saying that
you don't want to run?

09:42.160 --> 09:45.262
I'm saying that I don't
want to play the game.

09:45.296 --> 09:49.099
You're saying that
you don't want to run.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.435
I'm saying I don't want to run.

09:56.253 --> 09:59.207
I'm done. I'm done running for office.

09:59.207 --> 09:59.850
I...

09:59.850 --> 10:03.717
We're done running for office.

10:06.957 --> 10:09.675
Wow. Okay. Okay. We're done.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.799
We're done running for office.

10:20.646 --> 10:23.418
Now I know you're wondering
whether my wife's health

10:23.418 --> 10:25.386
had anything to do with this decision.

10:25.420 --> 10:28.389
And the answer is, yes,
and so did my heart attack.

10:28.423 --> 10:32.265
Through both crises, I
learned not to be more careful

10:32.265 --> 10:36.160
but to be more bold,
to take more chances...

10:36.160 --> 10:38.959
Because this is the
only life that we get.

10:39.590 --> 10:40.787
But let me be clear.

10:40.787 --> 10:43.499
Although I won't be running
for reelection in November,

10:43.499 --> 10:46.078
I remain committed to
serving all Californians

10:46.078 --> 10:48.655
as their senator for
the remainder of my term,

10:48.655 --> 10:53.296
and then after that, as
an engaged private citizen.

10:53.915 --> 10:57.100
Senator! Senator! Will
you be endorsing anyone

10:57.100 --> 10:58.851
- in the Republican primary, senator?
- I think

10:58.851 --> 11:00.441
I'm gonna wait and see
o jumps in to the pool

11:00.441 --> 11:00.632
- before I... I get into that.
- Is there any

11:00.633 --> 11:02.156
truth to the rumors
that Mrs. McCallister

11:02.190 --> 11:05.977
was thinking of running
for congress in the 54th?

11:06.726 --> 11:08.115
I'm... I'm sorry?

11:08.115 --> 11:10.440
Word on the street is
that she's interested.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.864
Well, why don't we
let Kitty answer that?

11:13.864 --> 11:15.328
Uh, w... well...

11:15.328 --> 11:18.247
Well, uh, no, no. I-i actually
haven't heard that rumor.

11:18.281 --> 11:19.748
H... have you?

11:19.782 --> 11:21.750
No. No.
- No, you're sorry.

11:21.784 --> 11:23.565
You're, uh, you're on
your own with that one.

11:23.566 --> 11:24.753
Yes, butt's a good try, Steve.

11:24.787 --> 11:27.756
- Yes. Senator.
- What's next, senator?

11:27.790 --> 11:30.092
Any specific plans for after next year?

11:31.107 --> 11:33.028
Why'd I drink so much water?

11:33.062 --> 11:36.698
Well... a full bladder

11:36.733 --> 11:39.835
makes your uterus easy
to see with the sonogram.

11:39.869 --> 11:41.803
Is it gonna hurt?

11:41.838 --> 11:43.205
Actually...

11:43.239 --> 11:46.275
It's done.

11:46.309 --> 11:49.878
Two embryos.

11:49.913 --> 11:52.014
Oh, wow. Really?

11:52.048 --> 11:53.782
Talk about premature ejaculation.

11:53.816 --> 11:55.851
Now, Michelle, I need you to stay still

11:55.885 --> 11:59.054
and lie here for an hour.

11:59.088 --> 12:01.590
After that, it's 36 hours of bed rest.

12:01.624 --> 12:04.726
- My friend Sam's gonna help me.
- Uh, what friend Sam?

12:04.761 --> 12:06.862
She has a friend named
Sam. What's the problem?

12:06.896 --> 12:09.031
No problem. No Sam. We're
gonna take care of her.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.739
She's not gonna move. We're
not taking any chances.

12:10.739 --> 12:14.636
You do know that with in
vitro, you need to abstain

12:14.671 --> 12:16.805
from sexual activity for up to week 16?

12:16.839 --> 12:18.206
16?

12:18.241 --> 12:21.176
No, I did not know that.

12:21.210 --> 12:23.745
Oh, well, now you do.

12:23.780 --> 12:27.182
Maybe you guys should abstain
for 16 weeks in solidarity.

12:31.933 --> 12:34.685
You're really bustin' out
the big guns for this guy.

12:34.685 --> 12:36.325
Yeah, are you sure you shouldn't save

12:36.359 --> 12:38.545
the bundt cake for, like,
maybe later in the relationship?

12:38.546 --> 12:39.828
Oh, I've got plenty of hot recipes

12:39.862 --> 12:42.331
- where that one came from.
- Oh, my goodness.

12:42.365 --> 12:44.408
You really like this guy. This is great.

12:44.408 --> 12:47.212
No, I just like how
easy he makes everything.

12:47.437 --> 12:50.846
You know, I have had so much
drama in my romantic life,

12:50.846 --> 12:52.674
and I've realized that relationships

12:52.709 --> 12:54.977
- do not have to be like that.
- Really? Who knew?

12:55.011 --> 12:57.245
- Hey.
- So this guy...

12:57.280 --> 13:00.964
For me, for where I am at right now...

13:00.964 --> 13:03.218
He's kind of perfect.

13:03.252 --> 13:05.520
Perfect?

13:07.270 --> 13:08.189
Oh, it's Scotty.

13:08.189 --> 13:11.699
Hey. Are you, uh, are
you knocked up yet?

13:11.699 --> 13:13.829
Ah, well, keep your fingers crossed.

13:13.863 --> 13:16.109
We just need to elevate her
feet so the salmon can swim

13:16.110 --> 13:18.233
- upstream.
- Okay, so I'm just gonna put you on speaker

13:18.267 --> 13:22.004
-  so I'm not the only one grossed out. Hold on, buddy.
- Hi, guys.

13:22.038 --> 13:23.505
Hey. Hi.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.576
Hi, total strangers who know
way too much about my business.

13:27.610 --> 13:29.444
How did everything go?

13:29.479 --> 13:33.503
Oh, well, you know, um, the
buns are orbiting the oven.

13:33.503 --> 13:36.455
We just need to keep
squirmy mcsquirmy-pants still

13:36.455 --> 13:38.420
for the next 36 hours so they can land.

13:38.454 --> 13:40.922
Oh, Michelle, I was working
like crazy when I got pregnant.

13:40.957 --> 13:42.772
- Don't let them drive you nuts.
- Oh, we're just

13:42.773 --> 13:44.426
trying to be overly
cautious. That's all.

13:44.494 --> 13:47.929
- Where's Kevin?
- Oh, Robert called. He said it was important.

13:47.964 --> 13:50.732
You know how that is.
Robert calls, Kevin jumps.

13:50.767 --> 13:53.268
That sort of... thing...

13:53.922 --> 13:56.071
Michelle, what's that smell?

13:57.648 --> 13:59.662
Ah, that's my oven.

13:59.662 --> 14:00.542
I have a gas leak.

14:00.576 --> 14:03.145
- The landlord was supposed to fix it.
- A gas leak?

14:03.179 --> 14:05.176
- Just a little one.
- Scotty, you've

14:05.177 --> 14:07.416
gotta get her out of there right now.

14:07.450 --> 14:08.799
Well, the doctor said
she's supposed to be

14:08.800 --> 14:10.085
- on bed rest.
-Well, find her a different bed.

14:10.119 --> 14:12.921
Uh, well, I guess we'll
take her back to our place.

14:12.955 --> 14:15.857
- Come on. Where would you two sleep?
- I don't...

14:15.892 --> 14:18.527
bring her over tonight.
The kids are with Joe,

14:18.561 --> 14:19.726
- so she can have Paige's room.
- Oh, thank you,

14:19.727 --> 14:20.495
thank you, thank you so much.

14:20.530 --> 14:22.431
And thank God Kevin's not here.

14:22.465 --> 14:24.499
- He'd be having a nervous breakdown.
- Come on.

14:25.068 --> 14:28.841
5... 0... 4... 7-2.

14:28.841 --> 14:31.692
That's all I needed,
Peggy. Thank you very much.

14:31.692 --> 14:33.321
- Nora?
- Aah!

14:33.321 --> 14:35.459
God. No, I'm fine. It's just Saul.

14:35.459 --> 14:38.077
Sorry, Peggy. I yelled
right in your ear.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.403
Okay, bye.

14:39.993 --> 14:43.017
- My God, Saul. You scared me to death.
- I'm sorry.

14:43.017 --> 14:45.439
Next time would you knock
on a door or make a noise?

14:45.439 --> 14:47.731
What do I have to knock
for Nora? It's my office.

14:47.731 --> 14:49.609
- What are you doing here?
- I'm talking to the accountant.

14:49.609 --> 14:53.330
Yeah, I know. I heard you.
Why are you sitting at my desk?

14:54.154 --> 14:57.123
Um... I'm... I'm just
doing Sarah a favor.

14:57.123 --> 14:58.708
She came by this morning and mentioned

14:58.708 --> 15:01.386
there was a problem filing the taxes.

15:02.529 --> 15:04.817
Oh, I see. Sarah said
there was a problem.

15:05.805 --> 15:06.931
Well, uh...

15:06.931 --> 15:08.726
A snafu, really.

15:08.726 --> 15:11.842
- A snafu?
- You didn't do the payroll taxes.

15:11.842 --> 15:14.565
Yeah, Nora, I know. That's
why I'm here to fix it.

15:14.565 --> 15:17.456
And if Sarah was so worried,
why didn't she call me

15:17.456 --> 15:20.666
instead of sending my baby
sister to make it worse?

15:20.666 --> 15:24.561
She didn't send me. I... I offered.

15:24.561 --> 15:26.652
And talk about worried?
You know what, Saul?

15:26.652 --> 15:28.971
I'm worried about
you. Are you all right?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.593
We haven't spoken in weeks.

15:30.593 --> 15:33.871
Well, perhaps that's
because I'm busy doing my job

15:33.871 --> 15:36.294
and I don't have all day to
spend talking on the phone.

15:37.987 --> 15:39.318
Why are you being so defensive?

15:39.318 --> 15:40.318
Because you're sitting at my desk

15:40.318 --> 15:42.473
making God knows what kind
of a mess out of my files.

15:42.473 --> 15:46.387
I'm not making a mess.
I fixed the problem.

15:46.387 --> 15:48.149
I was trying to help
you. You should thank me.

15:48.149 --> 15:50.123
What for, Nora? I don't need your help.

15:50.123 --> 15:53.512
I'm the CFO, not some
housewife in need of a hobby.

15:53.512 --> 15:54.509
Now if you will excuse me,

15:54.509 --> 15:57.415
i would like to sit down
at my desk and do my work.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.386
Fine. I'm leaving.

15:59.386 --> 16:01.196
Excuse me for trying to make your life

16:01.196 --> 16:03.093
just a little bit easier.

16:03.534 --> 16:07.221
- Sarah said you were crabby, but that is an understatement.
- Oh.

16:07.692 --> 16:08.977
The form is complete.

16:08.977 --> 16:11.336
But since I am such a
lowly amateur in your eyes,

16:11.336 --> 16:13.851
- perhaps you should
double-check it. - Oh, I will.

16:20.281 --> 16:22.285
Thanks to all you dedicated parents,

16:22.285 --> 16:24.769
the middle school garden
has grown tremendously

16:24.769 --> 16:25.981
over the past year.

16:25.981 --> 16:28.578
And the cooks in the
cafeteria are loving it, too.

16:28.578 --> 16:29.725
So great job.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.565
Now on to a more serious topic.

16:34.565 --> 16:35.570
As you know,

16:35.570 --> 16:37.796
the parent safety
committee has concluded

16:37.796 --> 16:40.574
that doing random searches
on lockers and backpacks

16:40.574 --> 16:43.066
might ease a lot of the
security stress at the school.

16:43.066 --> 16:46.778
So we'd like to hear from you
parents about your feelings.

16:46.778 --> 16:48.034
Yes.

16:48.034 --> 16:50.589
Uh, hi, everyone. Um, Sarah Walker.

16:50.589 --> 16:52.719
I think this is a horrible idea.

16:52.719 --> 16:54.947
Being a student shouldn't Rob you

16:54.947 --> 16:57.513
of your right to protection
against unreasonable searches.

16:57.513 --> 16:59.822
Frankly, I'm a little shocked
that the safety committee

16:59.822 --> 17:01.285
would pursue a course of action

17:01.285 --> 17:03.837
that doesn't consider
their kids' civil rights.

17:03.837 --> 17:07.130
Uh, well, we did regard
the children's civil rights.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.980
Oh, th... that's you?

17:09.980 --> 17:11.859
I... I'm the head of
the committee, yeah.

17:11.859 --> 17:14.272
Oh, uh, well, Roy, I'm
sure you didn't mean

17:14.272 --> 17:15.731
to just slam this thing through

17:15.731 --> 17:18.501
given nothing's actually ever happened.

17:18.742 --> 17:22.073
You didn't happen to, uh, read
about the study that was done

17:22.073 --> 17:24.143
on the middle schools in San Antonio?

17:24.195 --> 17:26.260
No. No, I missed that.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.253
It essentially tells us that, uh,

17:28.253 --> 17:30.665
you can't tell what's
in a kid's backpack

17:30.665 --> 17:32.197
unless you check it.

17:32.197 --> 17:35.090
Uh, but what about the
parents? Isn't that our job?

17:35.090 --> 17:37.220
I know what's in my kid's backpack.

17:37.855 --> 17:41.180
- What was in your kid's backpack today?
- Lunch and books.

17:41.180 --> 17:43.424
But what's gonna be in
their backpack tomorrow?

17:43.424 --> 17:45.351
'Cause that's the question.

17:45.351 --> 17:48.443
They're changing so fast, it...
it's impossible to keep up.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.292
Yes, that's why

17:49.292 --> 17:52.574
you need to have a
relationship with your child.

17:52.574 --> 17:54.668
Now I don't have an
unbroken circle, Roy,

17:54.668 --> 17:57.809
but... I trust my children.

17:57.809 --> 18:00.410
What about the older
children, the upperclassmen?

18:00.410 --> 18:02.304
- Do you trust them?
- No, I guess I don't.

18:02.304 --> 18:05.672
I guess I need my school to
do all the parenting for me.

18:05.672 --> 18:07.290
In fact, why doesn't Principal Frazier

18:07.290 --> 18:09.603
come over to my house
tonight and tuck my kids in?

18:09.603 --> 18:11.361
Come on. Where does this stop?

18:11.361 --> 18:14.821
It's a slippery slope down
to... to Hoover and the CIA.

18:14.821 --> 18:17.053
All right. Does anyone
else have an opinion?

18:17.053 --> 18:18.841
Excuse me. I haven't finished actually.

18:18.841 --> 18:20.902
This is no longer
productive, Ms. Walker.

18:20.902 --> 18:23.167
But I can assure you, this
will be discussed further

18:23.167 --> 18:25.185
in committee.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.607
Well, I'm gonna come to that meeting.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.834
You'd have to be a
member of the committee

18:28.834 --> 18:30.089
- to do that.
- I'm gonna join the committee.

18:30.089 --> 18:32.497
- We're full up.
- I'll start another committee, a counter committee,

18:32.497 --> 18:34.955
- a better committee.
- Hoover was head of the FBI.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.476
Michelle, could you take it easy?

18:41.476 --> 18:44.366
- I'm not moving, Kevin
- You're flapping your arms,

18:44.366 --> 18:45.378
and you have to stay still or it might

18:45.378 --> 18:48.345
- not stick.
- It's an embryo not velcro.

18:49.358 --> 18:50.542
Yes!

18:51.229 --> 18:53.448
Don't start your victory
dance. It's my serve now.

18:53.448 --> 18:55.077
Let her win, would you?

18:55.725 --> 18:59.662
I don't want to play if
he's gonna throw the game.

18:59.662 --> 19:01.415
Hey, do... do you guys
want to hear a joke?

19:01.415 --> 19:03.093
She's not supposed to laugh.

19:04.289 --> 19:05.567
Where... where are you going?

19:05.567 --> 19:07.444
I have to use the
bathroom. Is that all right?

19:07.444 --> 19:09.002
Well, do you really
have to use the bathroom

19:09.002 --> 19:12.891
- or are you just being spiteful?
- Do you want to find out?

19:15.166 --> 19:16.262
Come on, Scotty.

19:16.262 --> 19:17.780
You have to back me up over this.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.359
You heard what the doctor
said. No moving at all.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.626
So what does that mean?
She has to be careful.

19:22.626 --> 19:24.223
She also said that
some women go jogging,

19:24.223 --> 19:26.170
some women have sex and
drink the next morning,

19:26.170 --> 19:29.112
- and nine months later, they still...
- I know, I know, I know.

19:29.594 --> 19:34.069
I'm sorry. I just really,
really want this to work.

19:40.211 --> 19:42.244
Oh. There you are. What
happened to your car?

19:42.244 --> 19:43.153
Oh, they had to tow it.

19:43.153 --> 19:45.085
All the lights lit up on
the dashboard, and then

19:45.085 --> 19:47.878
the whole thing went apoplectic
and just dropped dead,

19:47.878 --> 19:50.367
just like my relationship
with Mr. Perfect.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.960
The two of you had an argument?

19:51.960 --> 19:54.160
No, I just had the nerve
to stick to my opinion

19:54.160 --> 19:55.774
about how to raise my children.

19:55.774 --> 19:58.383
I challenged him. What's worse,
I challenged him in public.

19:58.383 --> 19:59.311
And that's what happens.

19:59.311 --> 20:03.713
If you don't smile and nod,
men get very threatened.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.184
And I'm done with it.
I'm done, mom. I...

20:06.184 --> 20:07.290
no more dating for me.

20:07.290 --> 20:10.973
I'm just gonna go into a
quiet, happy life of abstinence.

20:11.541 --> 20:14.411
- Does that mean he's not coming to dinner?
- Yes, mom.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.534
He won't be coming to dinner.

20:17.201 --> 20:18.994
Oh, sweetheart.

20:18.994 --> 20:20.718
I really liked him.

20:23.216 --> 20:24.870
I don't know what I was thinking.

20:24.870 --> 20:27.204
I'm just... I'm stupid. I know.

20:27.204 --> 20:29.098
You know what? I... I'm... I
don't want to think about it.

20:29.098 --> 20:31.476
Let's move on. Come on.
Let's get outta here.

20:31.476 --> 20:34.660
- Oh, how did everything go at Ojai?
- It was a disaster.

20:34.660 --> 20:37.303
Mom, you said that you
would take care of it.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.619
No, I did. I was great. It was...

20:39.619 --> 20:41.273
my brother was the disaster.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.009
He came in and saw me
working in his office,

20:43.009 --> 20:45.632
and he had absolute hissy fit.

20:45.632 --> 20:48.228
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. He... he called me a dilettante

20:48.228 --> 20:50.947
and... and said I was a
housewife in need of a hobby.

20:50.947 --> 20:52.518
- Well, I told you he was very snappy.
- More than snappy.

20:52.518 --> 20:55.110
He's just looking for
any excuse to lash out.

20:55.110 --> 20:57.615
Yeah, but it felt so good to be working,

20:57.615 --> 21:00.209
like the old days back at Ojai.

21:00.730 --> 21:02.716
Well, I'm proud of you.

21:02.716 --> 21:03.682
He's not.

21:03.682 --> 21:05.843
Well, you're a strong woman.

21:05.843 --> 21:08.574
If he is threatened by that, so be it.

21:08.574 --> 21:10.471
- Right on, sister.
- Yeah.

21:10.471 --> 21:12.496
Oh! I don't know how
you could do that...

21:12.496 --> 21:14.132
tell people that I was
running for congress

21:14.132 --> 21:16.900
- in the 54th.
- Because you wanted me to.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.337
- I never told you to do that.
- I know. You didn't have to.

21:20.337 --> 21:21.861
I knew what you wanted
even if you didn't.

21:21.861 --> 21:23.480
Look, you're gonna be a great candidate.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.269
You'll be a great public servant.

21:25.269 --> 21:27.065
- I mean, give me a little credit for being good at my job.
- Look,

21:27.065 --> 21:28.940
nobody ever said that you
weren't good at your job.

21:28.940 --> 21:30.558
But I have to tell you
that this is a decision

21:30.558 --> 21:32.142
that I have to make, okay?

21:32.142 --> 21:34.630
It's private. It's... it's personal.

21:34.630 --> 21:37.593
And I'm sorry to say, but
Robert is a part of it.

21:37.593 --> 21:38.988
Oh, you've got nothing to worry about.

21:38.988 --> 21:40.974
I never said this came from you.

21:40.974 --> 21:43.864
That's not the point. The point is,

21:43.864 --> 21:46.348
I don't even know if want
to be in this position again.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.635
- And what position is that?
- Eating three dinners

21:48.635 --> 21:50.686
because I don't want
to offend two cooks...

21:50.686 --> 21:52.620
Keeping a smile plastered on my face

21:52.620 --> 21:54.982
even though I'm missing
my son's bedtime...

21:54.982 --> 21:58.252
Uh, kissing up, twisting arms,
and... and the worst of it

21:58.252 --> 22:01.618
is remembering to lie when
I'm having lunch with a friend.

22:01.982 --> 22:03.819
Man, you are good. Listen.

22:03.819 --> 22:06.582
Yes. I'm gonna give
you this. It's a gift.

22:06.582 --> 22:09.560
Robert just announced
that he's not running,

22:09.560 --> 22:11.622
and neither am I.

22:12.462 --> 22:14.704
I am sorry to hear that.

22:14.704 --> 22:17.062
When you change your
mind, give me a call.

22:17.612 --> 22:20.676
Mm-hmm. Nice try.

22:20.676 --> 22:22.582
I'm not gonna change my mind.

22:22.582 --> 22:23.904
Mnh-mnh.

22:28.325 --> 22:30.830
Okay, here you are...
two bottles of water

22:30.830 --> 22:33.648
and an entire newsstand
worth of magazines.

22:33.648 --> 22:38.890
Thanks. So Sam just texted
me, and he is on his way.

22:39.889 --> 22:40.673
You don't think that Kevin's

22:40.673 --> 22:42.723
gonna be coming up
here all night, right?

22:44.188 --> 22:45.622
Yes.

22:46.634 --> 22:47.624
Here's the thing...

22:47.624 --> 22:49.377
I didn't know how to tell Kevin this,

22:49.377 --> 22:52.492
- but Sam is more than just a friend.
- You're kidding me, right?

22:52.492 --> 22:55.989
- Don't you get upset.
- Well, how long have you been seeing him?

22:56.258 --> 22:57.152
A month.

22:57.152 --> 22:58.124
- Oh.
- Where does it say

22:58.124 --> 23:00.260
- that a surrogate can't have a boyfriend?
- Nowhere,

23:00.260 --> 23:02.204
but you have to tell us these things.

23:02.204 --> 23:04.775
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I thought Kevin would get mad.

23:04.775 --> 23:05.738
Yeah, well, he's gonna be a lot madder

23:05.738 --> 23:07.442
now that you kept it from us.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.782
Okay, at least tell me he's a nice guy.

23:13.782 --> 23:15.869
Yes. He's a really nice guy,

23:15.869 --> 23:19.322
and he's really responsible
and he's really sweet.

23:19.322 --> 23:23.030
And he's just a little
younger than I am.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.104
How much younger?

23:25.104 --> 23:26.774
19.

23:26.774 --> 23:28.039
N...

23:30.128 --> 23:32.160
Oh, come on. Kitty
would've said something

23:32.160 --> 23:33.468
if she was serious about running.

23:33.468 --> 23:35.926
I'm telling you, the
question unnerved her.

23:35.926 --> 23:38.150
Here, come on. Let's get started.

23:39.342 --> 23:39.845
What are you gonna do,

23:39.845 --> 23:42.832
- just drink yourself into a stupor tonight?
- You betcha.

23:42.832 --> 23:44.566
I mean, let's face it...

23:44.566 --> 23:46.980
Roy's hardly gonna show up, is he?

23:47.533 --> 23:48.893
I was actually quite restrained.

23:48.893 --> 23:51.957
I didn't call him a fascist,
which is what I was thinking.

23:51.957 --> 23:53.397
That's restrained?

23:54.024 --> 23:55.352
Look, you just need to find a man

23:55.352 --> 23:58.740
who's comfortable with
you being a strong woman.

23:59.574 --> 24:01.800
Do you remember when you
and I used to arm wrestle,

24:01.800 --> 24:04.084
and I always used to beat you?

24:04.730 --> 24:08.056
- Did you find that threatening?
- Sports were never my thing.

24:08.524 --> 24:10.053
Listen, uh, Kevin,

24:10.053 --> 24:12.040
Sam is on his way over
here with some dvds.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.390
- Great. He can leave them with me.
- Kevin,

24:13.390 --> 24:15.784
we can't control her.
She has a personal life.

24:16.308 --> 24:18.572
- Be nice.
- Well, if he wants to stay for dinner,

24:18.572 --> 24:21.370
I have a spare seat... place.

24:22.992 --> 24:24.554
I hope you're not Sam.

24:24.554 --> 24:26.124
Uh, no.

24:27.515 --> 24:29.193
Roy.

24:29.193 --> 24:32.257
Oh, my God. Wh... what
are you doing here?

24:32.257 --> 24:34.836
Y... you invited me to dinner.

24:36.338 --> 24:39.884
Oh. Oh, well, yes, of course I did.

24:39.884 --> 24:43.094
I guess I figured, after
our little argument...

24:43.094 --> 24:45.741
Well, uh, uh, look, Sarah.
Roy has brought wine.

24:45.741 --> 24:47.690
- I'm Kevin. This is Scotty.
- Hi.

24:47.690 --> 24:49.221
- Hey.
- Thank you.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.794
Do you have a backpack we should check?

24:54.311 --> 24:55.366
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:55.366 --> 24:57.116
I can't believe Michelle is really here.

24:57.116 --> 24:58.622
Yeah, so don't bother her.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.939
Hello. I'm... I'm Nora Walker.

24:59.939 --> 25:02.646
- Mom, this is Roy.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

25:02.646 --> 25:06.020
Very nice to meet you. I've
heard so much about you.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.185
- Shut up.
- Hi.

25:07.185 --> 25:11.030
- Hi, Saul.
- Hello.

25:11.030 --> 25:13.237
Uncle Saul, this is, um, my friend Roy.

25:13.237 --> 25:15.302
- Hi, Roy. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

25:15.302 --> 25:16.506
Saul, I'm gonna go upstairs

25:16.506 --> 25:18.069
and meet Michelle, the surrogate.

25:18.069 --> 25:20.727
- Why don't you come with me?
- No, thank you.

25:20.727 --> 25:24.279
- Oh, fine. Suit yourself.
- Mom, don't get her riled up.

25:24.279 --> 25:27.144
- Hello.
- Hello. Roy, this is my sister Kitty...

25:27.144 --> 25:29.108
- How are you?
- And her husband Robert.

25:29.108 --> 25:30.347
- How are you?
- Good.

25:30.347 --> 25:32.915
You want to get some
wine? I think you do.

25:33.527 --> 25:35.687
So is this your first
Walker dinner party?

25:35.687 --> 25:37.965
- It is.
- Good luck.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.745
Oh, Robert.

25:40.745 --> 25:42.001
He's a... funny guy.

25:42.001 --> 25:45.013
I saw your face, okay? The only
reason Robert isn't suspicious

25:45.013 --> 25:46.095
is because he doesn't know what you

25:46.095 --> 25:48.171
- told us at the hospital.
- Oh, Kevin.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.955
Just because I said I
was thinking about running

25:50.039 --> 25:51.733
- doesn't mean I'm gonna do it.
- Well, that depends

25:51.733 --> 25:53.667
on who you've been
thinking about it with.

25:53.667 --> 25:55.378
All right, all right. I made a mistake.

25:55.378 --> 25:58.581
I made a very, very big mistake. Buffy.

25:58.581 --> 25:59.663
- You remember Buffy?
- Yeah.

25:59.663 --> 26:02.813
Well, I told her that I
was considering running.

26:02.813 --> 26:05.138
It... I don't know. I guess...
I guess she blabbed it.

26:05.138 --> 26:08.089
- I knew this was a story. I knew it.
- Shh, shh, shh.

26:09.248 --> 26:10.817
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing.

26:10.817 --> 26:12.281
It's like one of those back rooms

26:12.281 --> 26:14.711
where political deals get done.

26:15.050 --> 26:16.731
I told you. She wants to run.

26:19.343 --> 26:21.113
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Shh. No.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.713
- Kitty, that's fantastic.
- No, no.

26:22.713 --> 26:24.609
And even if I did want to
run, I can't do it anyway

26:24.609 --> 26:28.233
- because Robert... dropped out of politics today.
- Well, so?

26:28.233 --> 26:31.110
- Can't you drop in?
- No, no, you don't understand.

26:31.110 --> 26:33.215
He did it for me. He dropped
out of politics for me.

26:33.215 --> 26:35.009
Well, have you even
talked to him about this?

26:35.009 --> 26:36.692
- No, and I'm not going to.
- Well...

26:36.692 --> 26:39.064
- No, no, shh. My life is fine.
- Yeah?

26:39.064 --> 26:41.749
In fact, my life is
fabulous just the way it is.

26:41.749 --> 26:42.986
- So... you know what we're doing?
- What?

26:42.986 --> 26:46.690
We're being rude. Rude.
Now come on. Come on.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.332
I promise you that she wants to run.

26:49.746 --> 26:51.007
Wine.

26:51.851 --> 26:53.067
Great.

26:53.067 --> 26:57.407
- Oh! By the way, Sam's here.
- He is?

26:57.407 --> 26:58.456
Mm-hmm.

27:00.388 --> 27:01.970
Well, listen, you guys have fun.

27:01.970 --> 27:03.902
We'll just be downstairs.
Call us if you need us, okay?

27:03.902 --> 27:05.281
We're gonna watch a zombie movie.

27:05.281 --> 27:07.028
You're gonna watch a zombie movie?

27:07.028 --> 27:09.214
- I don't want her seeing anything violent.
- K... Kevin,

27:09.214 --> 27:10.984
it's just a movie. For goodness sakes.

27:10.984 --> 27:14.047
Wh... when I was pregnant
with you, I saw "The Exorcist,"

27:14.047 --> 27:17.038
- and you turned out just fine.
- Well, uh, she's not pregnant yet.

27:17.038 --> 27:17.597
That's the whole point.

27:17.597 --> 27:19.745
- And second of all, he didn't turn out just fine.
- No.

27:19.745 --> 27:21.939
Um, Kevin, this is Sam.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.384
It's, uh, great to meet you.

27:26.465 --> 27:28.505
So... anyway, come on. Let's go.

27:28.505 --> 27:29.523
- Yeah.
- Bye, guys.

27:29.523 --> 27:30.466
Bye.

27:31.979 --> 27:34.579
Uh, she... she's... she's
on bed rest. Got that?

27:36.060 --> 27:37.351
Yes, sir.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.624
Yeah.

27:41.769 --> 27:44.020
I was very sorry to hear
about your announcement today.

27:44.020 --> 27:45.245
Mm. But I understand.

27:45.245 --> 27:47.325
I left the company I was working for

27:47.325 --> 27:48.985
to start my own, uh, agency.

27:48.985 --> 27:50.141
Best thing you ever did, right?

27:50.141 --> 27:51.982
I'm traveling a lot more now, though.

27:51.982 --> 27:53.723
- And I hate airports.
- Well, I'm afraid you

27:53.723 --> 27:55.281
can blame me for the whole shoe thing.

27:55.281 --> 27:58.024
- I'm the senate committee on homeland security.
- Oh, don't worry.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.012
- Roy loves x-ray
machines. - Oh, you should

28:00.012 --> 28:00.971
see the ones we're working on now.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.587
You can barely get a
thumbtack through 'em.

28:02.587 --> 28:03.487
I think she's alluding

28:03.487 --> 28:05.568
- to a little disagreement we had earlier.
- Well,

28:05.568 --> 28:06.912
you guys just met, and
you've already had a fight?

28:06.912 --> 28:09.452
No, it was more of a political dustup.

28:09.452 --> 28:11.560
I loved your book, by the way.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.067
Wow. Wow. You...
you... you read my book?

28:14.067 --> 28:16.169
- It's terrific.
- Thank you.

28:16.482 --> 28:18.826
Sorry. We were just talking to Michelle,

28:18.826 --> 28:21.665
who is stuck in bed
for the next 36 hours.

28:21.735 --> 28:23.806
Mm. Uh, 26 and counting, actually.

28:23.806 --> 28:25.806
Ah, Kevin, uh, Roy was just saying

28:25.806 --> 28:27.657
how much he enjoyed Kitty's book.

28:27.657 --> 28:30.464
Oh, well, she does have
a great political mind.

28:30.464 --> 28:33.234
- Wouldn't you say, Robert?
- It's one of the reasons I married her.

28:33.234 --> 28:34.856
My sister gave it to
me. She's a Democrat,

28:34.856 --> 28:36.355
- and I'm a Republican, so...
- Oh...

28:36.355 --> 28:39.020
Oh, this just keeps
getting better and better.

28:39.020 --> 28:41.254
- That explains everything.
- Explains what?

28:41.254 --> 28:42.681
I believe schools have the right

28:42.681 --> 28:45.313
to search lockers and backpacks.

28:45.313 --> 28:48.378
Without good cause.
Now that's crazy, right?

28:48.378 --> 28:50.359
- No, I don't think that's crazy at all.
- What?

28:50.359 --> 28:53.351
What if someone brings
a gun onto campus?

28:53.351 --> 28:55.269
Mom, I can't believe you're saying this.

28:55.269 --> 28:57.032
My kids go to school in D.C.

28:57.032 --> 28:58.476
I don't want anything
getting into that building

28:58.476 --> 29:00.728
- other than homework.
- Come on.

29:00.728 --> 29:03.355
It's... it's an invasion
of the kids' privacy.

29:03.355 --> 29:06.175
It's gotta be illegal. Right,
Kevin? Back me up on this.

29:06.175 --> 29:08.751
- No, I don't think so. Not on school property.
- Really?

29:08.751 --> 29:09.669
Mm-hmm.

29:10.262 --> 29:13.151
Well, are you happy now? My
whole family is on your side.

29:13.151 --> 29:15.110
No, I actually agree with Sarah.

29:15.110 --> 29:16.488
I mean, I don't think
the point is the search.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.258
It comes down to the
presumption of guilt,

29:18.258 --> 29:19.493
which flies in the face of everything

29:19.493 --> 29:21.333
- our country stands for.
- Yeah, we

29:21.333 --> 29:22.999
don't always agree on everything.

29:22.999 --> 29:24.592
Yeah. That's as it should be.

29:24.592 --> 29:26.612
What a perfect attitude.
Don't you think,

29:26.612 --> 29:29.545
- Sarah?
- Yes, I do, actually.

29:30.896 --> 29:32.407
Oh. So, uh, Kitty,

29:32.407 --> 29:35.238
have you ever thought
of running for office?

29:35.238 --> 29:37.297
Wow. That's twice in one day.

29:37.922 --> 29:39.320
N... no.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.954
No, you know, I... I don't
think that I have the...

29:41.954 --> 29:44.026
- the stomach for it.
- And really, it

29:44.026 --> 29:45.559
would certainly not be a good time.

29:45.559 --> 29:47.725
- I mean, you're really not healed, you haven't...
- Mom,

29:47.725 --> 29:49.336
please don't talk about cancer.

29:49.336 --> 29:50.808
We haven't talked about it
all night, and I don't...

29:50.808 --> 29:53.064
- just put a sock in it for once.
- You are

29:53.064 --> 29:54.954
absolutely right. We
shouldn't talk about it.

29:54.954 --> 29:57.199
Anyway, I find politics very boring,

29:57.199 --> 29:58.939
- and I'm glad you chose not to run.
- It's not

29:58.939 --> 30:00.514
about that. It's not about being boring.

30:00.514 --> 30:03.048
- Unpleasant, maybe, yeah.
- Just ignore him.

30:03.048 --> 30:04.789
He has been a pill all day.

30:04.789 --> 30:06.378
Saul, why don't you just go upstairs

30:06.378 --> 30:09.507
and introduce yourself to
Michelle and her boyfriend?

30:09.507 --> 30:11.533
And why don't you not tell me
what I should be doing, okay?

30:11.533 --> 30:14.053
- I'm perfectly happy the way I am.
- Boyfriend?

30:14.053 --> 30:15.370
I thought they were friends.

30:15.370 --> 30:18.441
- Okay, Kevin. Calm down.
- Are they a couple?

30:18.441 --> 30:20.629
Yes, they're dating.
She just told... Kevin.

30:20.629 --> 30:22.827
- Excuse me.
- That guy up there?

30:22.827 --> 30:25.437
- I'm sorry, everybody.
- I'm gonna get a beer. You want a beer?

30:25.437 --> 30:28.098
- Yeah, I'd love one.
- The Republicans are getting a beer.

30:28.098 --> 30:31.363
The Republicans are getting drunk.

30:33.739 --> 30:36.051
Well, fine. Maybe I'll go have a beer.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.152
Mom, come on. Stop it, the both of you.

30:38.152 --> 30:40.268
You're like children. Look,
you're so mad at each other,

30:40.268 --> 30:41.795
you can't even look
each other in the eye.

30:41.795 --> 30:43.667
I'm not angry. I'm hurt.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.176
What have you got to
be hurt about, Nora?

30:45.176 --> 30:48.399
You waltzed into my office.
You sat down at my desk.

30:48.399 --> 30:50.881
I went there today to try to help you.

30:50.881 --> 30:54.006
Well, you can't help. Okay?
Why don't you understand that?

30:54.006 --> 30:57.192
Whatever it is that I need,
you can't do anything about it.

30:58.139 --> 31:00.627
Look, I'm 70 years old,
okay? All I have is my job.

31:00.627 --> 31:02.271
So forgive me for... for being upset

31:02.271 --> 31:05.007
because the two of you told me
that I'm not doing it very well.

31:05.007 --> 31:07.242
I was trying to save you the trouble...

31:07.242 --> 31:09.962
Just don't. My work is all I have.

31:09.962 --> 31:11.704
My dreams are all gone. They're over.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.178
I... I... I'm too old for them.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.934
Okay, I shouldn't be here. That's all.

31:18.934 --> 31:20.173
I just...

31:20.693 --> 31:21.932
Oh. Aw, come on, Saul.

31:21.932 --> 31:23.409
Please don't go. Wait
a minute. Wait a minute.

31:23.409 --> 31:25.255
Uncle Saul, is that
what you really think,

31:25.255 --> 31:28.120
that... that it's too
late for your dreams?

31:30.240 --> 31:32.731
I mean, seriously,
because I almost died.

31:32.731 --> 31:34.181
And you know what? I...
I really believe that

31:34.181 --> 31:35.632
that's when your dreams become more

31:35.632 --> 31:37.342
important than ever. I'm sorry, Kitty.

31:37.342 --> 31:38.879
After what you've gone through, I

31:38.879 --> 31:41.135
- shouldn't be...
- It's okay. I understand.

31:41.135 --> 31:43.684
I'm... I'm just trying to
tell you that you're not alone,

31:43.684 --> 31:46.589
that I have totally wasted so much time.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.139
And, you know, I... I say

31:49.139 --> 31:50.769
that I don't have the
stomach for politics,

31:50.769 --> 31:51.930
but what I'm really trying to say

31:51.930 --> 31:53.917
is that i-i don't have the guts.

31:53.917 --> 31:56.413
- Oh, Kitty, you're nothing but guts.
- No.

31:56.413 --> 31:58.630
You are nothing but guts.

31:58.630 --> 32:00.570
And you exert a tremendous
amount of influence,

32:00.570 --> 32:03.474
- whether I like it or not.
- Well, not as much as I could.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.168
See, because that would require

32:05.168 --> 32:08.014
me sticking my neck out
farther, taking a risk...

32:08.014 --> 32:10.143
you know, getting myself
hurt, hurting somebody else.

32:10.143 --> 32:11.935
- It's all...
- I'm confused. You mean,

32:11.935 --> 32:13.580
you're actually thinking about...

32:13.580 --> 32:15.031
Running.

32:15.875 --> 32:19.021
Yeah, yeah. I... I am. I am.

32:19.021 --> 32:21.209
And... and you know what, Saul?

32:21.209 --> 32:22.785
We're still here.

32:22.785 --> 32:25.750
So I... I think we have to go for it.

32:26.324 --> 32:27.753
I truly believe that,

32:27.753 --> 32:29.740
and... and there just happens to be

32:29.740 --> 32:32.399
this very vulnerable
congressional candidate

32:32.399 --> 32:33.698
in the California 54th.

32:33.698 --> 32:36.739
And I think I'm just
gonna have to go after him.

32:39.130 --> 32:40.625
Thank you.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.186
Well, that was quite a speech.

32:52.146 --> 32:54.628
Honey, it... it just came to me.

32:54.628 --> 32:56.063
I... I was gonna... talk to me about it?

32:56.063 --> 32:58.031
Well, yeah. When?

33:04.749 --> 33:07.703
All right. That's it.
All the zombies are dead.

33:07.852 --> 33:10.519
We can go to sleep
feeling safe and sound.

33:11.683 --> 33:13.438
Wait. I like to watch the credits.

33:13.438 --> 33:17.236
- Why? No one would put their real name to that movie.
- I loved it.

33:17.786 --> 33:18.933
Yeah, I liked it, too.

33:18.933 --> 33:20.675
- Lights out. I mean it.
- Okay.

33:20.675 --> 33:22.151
I'll see you tomorrow.

33:23.436 --> 33:26.178
Michelle, he knows the rules,
right, for the next 16 weeks?

33:26.178 --> 33:28.280
Okay, Kevin. You're
gonna drive them crazy.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.553
- He's a teenager. They think about sex endlessly.
- Well, yes.

33:30.553 --> 33:33.397
- I'm right here, man.
- I know, man. That's the problem.

33:34.899 --> 33:36.110
All right, just so you know,

33:36.110 --> 33:38.987
i was so excited when she
told me what she was doing.

33:38.987 --> 33:40.442
I still am.

33:40.442 --> 33:42.277
I wish you guys a lot luck.

33:43.142 --> 33:44.431
Great. Now I feel bad.

33:44.431 --> 33:46.847
Maybe you'll be nicer from now on.

33:48.538 --> 33:50.995
Michelle, you... you... you
do know how grateful I am

33:50.995 --> 33:53.006
for everything you're doing, right?

33:54.005 --> 33:55.204
Yeah.

33:56.450 --> 33:58.634
Can I ask you guys a
question, seriously?

33:58.756 --> 34:00.209
Of course.

34:00.209 --> 34:02.273
If this doesn't work out,

34:02.273 --> 34:04.528
you're not gonna be mad at me, right?

34:04.528 --> 34:06.587
Oh, no. No, not at all.

34:06.587 --> 34:09.023
Okay, good, because
I can't stop laughing.

34:09.023 --> 34:11.978
It's impossible. I find the world funny.

34:11.978 --> 34:13.547
You're absolutely right.

34:13.547 --> 34:15.215
Do you know what I'm gonna do right now?

34:15.215 --> 34:18.036
- I'm gonna let Scotty tell his joke.
- Oh, really?

34:18.036 --> 34:19.494
Yeah. I'm a little nervous now, but...

34:19.494 --> 34:22.780
- Come on!
- Okay, do you want to see my impression of a gay owl?

34:22.780 --> 34:24.167
- Yeah.
- Yes.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.503
Who?

34:31.935 --> 34:32.650
It's good.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.194
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

34:34.194 --> 34:35.812
- Yeah.
- You made a funny.

34:37.411 --> 34:38.386
This is delicious.

34:38.386 --> 34:39.266
It is.

34:39.266 --> 34:41.826
It's a shame everybody left
before they got to try it.

34:43.855 --> 34:46.690
Well, I'm sorry about
tonight. The whole day, really.

34:46.690 --> 34:49.773
- I... I was a jerk.
- No, no.

34:49.773 --> 34:51.826
You know, the truth is...

34:51.826 --> 34:54.257
I think you hit a little bit of a nerve.

34:54.905 --> 34:56.708
W... with what?

34:57.423 --> 34:59.091
Paige's backpack.

34:59.091 --> 35:01.190
It's sitting right there.

35:01.190 --> 35:03.674
I have absolutely no idea what's in it.

35:03.929 --> 35:05.068
Last year I could've told you...

35:05.285 --> 35:07.784
"Harry Potter," chapstick, hair ties.

35:07.784 --> 35:08.621
This year...

35:09.954 --> 35:12.004
I never know who I'm gonna get.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.500
And we fight nonstop.

35:14.500 --> 35:17.178
I mean, I like a girl
that holds her ground,

35:17.178 --> 35:20.013
- but, oh, boy.
- That makes two of us.

35:22.625 --> 35:24.657
I w... I want to take this slow.

35:24.657 --> 35:27.887
I just, uh... I like you.

35:28.527 --> 35:29.911
And I wanted to say that.

35:33.022 --> 35:34.628
'Cause it's all about transparency.

35:38.065 --> 35:40.533
I like you, too.

35:58.790 --> 35:59.533
Well?

36:00.157 --> 36:02.573
Well? Oh, he's... he's fine, I think.

36:02.573 --> 36:04.675
Uh, we have to leave in 15 minutes.

36:04.709 --> 36:07.344
I was just looking at a speech
he wants to give next week.

36:08.187 --> 36:09.312
How about you? How are...

36:09.347 --> 36:11.882
how are you feeling about all of this?

36:11.916 --> 36:14.135
What, about you running
or me losing my job?

36:14.136 --> 36:16.053
You're not gonna lose your job, Kevin.

36:16.087 --> 36:18.355
I mean, you know that
whatever he does next,

36:18.389 --> 36:19.697
he's... he's gonna take you with him.

36:19.698 --> 36:20.857
I hope you're right about that,

36:20.892 --> 36:23.427
because with a little luck,
I'll have a family to support.

36:23.461 --> 36:26.563
Mm. How is she doing?
Is... is she resting?

36:26.597 --> 36:29.332
I hope so. It's like we
raised a child in one day.

36:29.367 --> 36:32.069
First we had to keep her
happy and entertained.

36:32.103 --> 36:33.575
And then we had to deal
with a teenaged boyfriend.

36:34.505 --> 36:36.440
You know, when you came out,

36:36.474 --> 36:38.408
the only thing that I was sad about...

36:38.443 --> 36:39.910
well... well, besides the fact

36:39.944 --> 36:41.539
that you disappointed my friend Wendy,

36:41.539 --> 36:44.097
- who was madly in love with you.
- Oh, I remember her.

36:44.097 --> 36:46.017
I was sad because...

36:47.185 --> 36:49.718
I thought that maybe you were
never gonna get to be a dad.

36:50.788 --> 36:53.690
And I think you are
gonna be... great at it.

36:53.725 --> 36:57.561
And I am so happy that
this is happening to you.

37:00.613 --> 37:02.908
Well, if you want
something badly enough,

37:02.908 --> 37:04.631
you find a way to get it.

37:06.698 --> 37:08.158
So you think I should do it?

37:08.158 --> 37:11.209
You think I should just
throw my hat in the ring?

37:12.680 --> 37:15.779
I think you should
talk with your husband.

37:17.982 --> 37:18.895
Bye.

37:19.450 --> 37:20.493
Bye.

37:24.622 --> 37:25.808
Good morning.

37:26.524 --> 37:29.026
Saul. Why didn't you call?

37:29.026 --> 37:30.638
I would've made you some breakfast.

37:30.638 --> 37:32.095
You've done enough for me already.

37:32.130 --> 37:34.123
Oh. You sound like
you're in a good mood.

37:34.123 --> 37:36.099
I am in a good mood. Kitty's right.

37:36.099 --> 37:38.414
Life is too precious to waste.

37:39.670 --> 37:41.536
Do you really think she's gonna run?

37:41.536 --> 37:43.524
I-i mean, she just got
out of the hospital.

37:43.524 --> 37:45.830
- I'm worried it's too soon.
- Kevin said that

37:45.830 --> 37:47.505
the race is gonna be piece of cake.

37:47.505 --> 37:51.014
- She probably won't even break a sweat.
- I hope.

37:51.048 --> 37:53.016
I'll tell you what,
though, she inspired me.

37:53.050 --> 37:56.920
- I did the stupidest thing this morning.
- What?

37:56.954 --> 37:58.388
Well...

37:58.422 --> 38:01.439
- I joined Silver Studs.
- What the hell is that?

38:01.439 --> 38:04.795
It's an online dating service
for gay men of a certain age.

38:04.829 --> 38:06.530
Yikes. Really?

38:06.564 --> 38:08.795
- Yeah. Guess what.
- What?

38:08.795 --> 38:10.901
I already got a friend request.

38:10.935 --> 38:14.604
Oh, my gosh. I... I should
join a dating service.

38:14.639 --> 38:16.973
Nora, the last time you dated someone,

38:17.008 --> 38:17.946
he went to jail, remember?

38:17.946 --> 38:19.679
So if I were you, I would take a breath.

38:19.679 --> 38:21.587
Anyway,this is not about me, so go on.

38:21.587 --> 38:23.389
Actually, it is about you.
That's why I came over.

38:23.389 --> 38:26.307
- I wanted to talk to you about something.
- Now what?

38:26.307 --> 38:27.880
Yesterday when you left my office,

38:28.553 --> 38:31.168
- I didn't think you could do it, so I checked your work.
- Yeah.

38:31.168 --> 38:35.888
- You did it.
- Well, Peggy helped me a little bit.

38:35.927 --> 38:36.814
Oh, come on, Nora.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.613
You were the best part of
Ojai when we first started.

38:40.137 --> 38:41.880
Do you remember William and you and I

38:41.880 --> 38:43.359
used to sit on these little fruit crates

38:43.359 --> 38:46.800
- and try to figure out how to get customers?
- Yes.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.161
You said something yesterday.
You said we were a family.

38:49.669 --> 38:51.860
That's right. Ojai is a family business.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.619
And I just want you to know
that whenever you want to come,

38:54.619 --> 38:56.977
you are most welcome.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.317
How was your flight?

39:12.328 --> 39:13.460
Good.

39:14.793 --> 39:16.633
Six hours of just thinking.

39:16.667 --> 39:19.269
Did you come up with any conclusions?

39:19.303 --> 39:20.841
That's funny. I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

39:21.939 --> 39:24.268
And... and just for the record,
didn't you almost divorce me

39:24.268 --> 39:25.888
for running for governor
without talking to you?

39:25.888 --> 39:27.811
Yes, because you were
lying in a hospital bed

39:27.845 --> 39:30.547
recovering from open-heart
surgery. Remember?

39:30.581 --> 39:32.682
And what are you recovering
from, the common cold?

39:36.587 --> 39:40.298
I'm, um... sorry.

39:42.627 --> 39:46.393
I... I am. I'm... I'm sorry
that I didn't talk to you. I...

39:47.846 --> 39:48.820
For the record,

39:48.820 --> 39:50.859
I haven't made any decisions yet.

39:50.859 --> 39:53.580
Well, that doesn't bode
well for your campaign.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.572
You gotta want it pretty bad
to suffer the slings and arrows.

39:55.606 --> 39:58.275
Robert, you have sacrificed
everything for me.

39:58.309 --> 39:59.709
You've given up your governorship.

39:59.744 --> 40:01.287
You've given up your
senate seat. How am I...

40:01.287 --> 40:02.532
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. First of all,

40:02.532 --> 40:03.988
those things aren't everything.

40:04.316 --> 40:07.393
And why can't you give me credit
for owning my own decision?

40:07.393 --> 40:10.444
- I'm the one who made it.
- Okay.

40:11.915 --> 40:14.257
And why wouldn't you talk to me?

40:15.079 --> 40:17.131
Because I didn't want
to ruin everything.

40:17.131 --> 40:19.229
Well, that's not gonna happen.

40:21.410 --> 40:22.002
So...

40:24.946 --> 40:26.012
You gonna do this?

40:26.012 --> 40:28.337
So what... what am I supposed to do,

40:28.337 --> 40:30.478
just start campaigning
just when you've said

40:30.478 --> 40:32.411
that you want out of
the whole thing? Yeah.

40:38.467 --> 40:40.027
You broke the cardinal rule of politics.

40:40.027 --> 40:41.604
You let the story get ahead of you.

40:41.604 --> 40:44.518
What are you doing talking to
somebody like Buffy McCreary?

40:44.518 --> 40:46.564
I don't know. I'm... I'm an idiot?

40:46.564 --> 40:48.259
In politics, the only people you trust

40:48.259 --> 40:49.465
are the people you're paying.

40:49.887 --> 40:50.742
Yes, dear.

40:53.168 --> 40:54.459
So?

40:54.459 --> 40:55.897
So I don't know. I don't know.

40:55.897 --> 40:58.266
You know, it's... it's
a very hard decision.

41:03.257 --> 41:04.888
As long as I know that...

41:05.474 --> 41:08.522
We won't lose... us.

41:08.522 --> 41:09.786
Are you kidding me?

41:09.786 --> 41:11.391
You're never getting rid of me now.

41:13.193 --> 41:14.294
Let me ask you, why
are you talking about

41:14.294 --> 41:16.344
this pissy little congressional seat?

41:16.344 --> 41:17.859
If you really want to run for office,

41:17.859 --> 41:19.592
I'll tell you whose
seat you should run for.

41:21.155 --> 41:22.593
- Whose?
- Mine.

41:26.853 --> 41:28.902
And we would kick ass.

41:32.980 --> 41:34.192
We would.

41:36.483 --> 41:38.217
We would.

41:38.217 --> 41:39.217
