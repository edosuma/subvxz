My name is Oliver Queen.

00:05.926 --> 00:08.029
After 5 years in hell...

00:08.032 --> 00:10.659
I returned home with only one goal...

00:10.662 --> 00:12.142
to save my city.

00:13.759 --> 00:17.117
For 8 years, I've fought
alongside brave men and women

00:17.120 --> 00:18.858
striving for justice,

00:18.861 --> 00:20.577
but then a Crisis came,

00:20.580 --> 00:22.863
and I had to become someone else.

00:22.865 --> 00:26.158
I had to become something else.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.443
I made the ultimate sacrifice,

00:28.445 --> 00:32.280
which helped birth an
entirely new universe.

00:32.281 --> 00:35.375
Now my friends and family
will have to go on without me,

00:35.377 --> 00:37.961

01:51.120 --> 01:53.954
The people that knew my son best tell me

01:53.956 --> 01:59.609
that when Oliver sacrificed
himself during the Crisis,

01:59.611 --> 02:07.116
that somehow he's the reason
that everything changed,

02:07.118 --> 02:09.877
that the world we're
living in right now is

02:09.880 --> 02:12.139

12:48.803 --> 12:50.261
I just...

12:50.263 --> 12:51.929
Ollie's just passed away,

12:51.931 --> 12:53.511
and William's been kidnapped,

12:53.522 --> 12:56.052
so... as far as apologies go,

12:56.055 --> 12:58.865
your timing's a little not great.

12:58.868 --> 13:01.511
JOHN: If you still think
Oliver's mission's finished,

13:01.514 --> 13:03.458
tell that to William
when we get him back.

13:03.460 --> 13:05.702
We will get him back, but, John, William

13:05.704 --> 13:07.820
was kidnapped outside of Star City.

13:07.822 --> 13:10.323
I'm sure that will make
him feel a whole lot better.

13:10.325 --> 13:12.467
- I reached out to Felicity.
- Yeah. Me, too.

13:12.469 --> 13:14.970
Radio silence.

13:14.972 --> 13:17.389
I asked Sara to check on her.

13:22.462 --> 13:25.090
Ah. I haven't seen this many
people down here in a while.

13:27.150 --> 13:28.400
Hey.

13:32.990 --> 13:34.489
Hey.

13:37.477 --> 13:39.369
It's almost like a party. Heh.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.672
CURTIS: Um, I tried running
a quad-grid search tasked

13:49.675 --> 13:50.992
to a keyhole satellite array, but...

13:50.993 --> 13:53.142
FELICITY: That array's dark-sided
as it undergoes a firmware upgrade,

13:53.143 --> 13:55.214
but fortunately when William
moved to Central City,

13:55.217 --> 13:57.958
his overbearing stepmom implanted
a subdermal tracking device

13:57.961 --> 14:00.693
into his arm. Ethical... debatable.

14:00.696 --> 14:02.887
Which went dark as soon
as he reentered Star City.

14:02.890 --> 14:04.776
Well, that's convenient at least.

14:04.779 --> 14:07.166
Just one second as I work up
a statistically correlated list

14:07.169 --> 14:09.244
of possible locations he could be at.

14:09.247 --> 14:10.807
That is a very long list.

14:10.810 --> 14:13.552
Which is exactly why we called everyone.

14:13.554 --> 14:15.196
JOHN: Thank you all for coming,

14:16.933 --> 14:18.867
some on very short notice.

14:20.605 --> 14:22.203
Oliver made the ultimate sacrifice

14:22.205 --> 14:26.107
for his friends and his family.

14:26.109 --> 14:28.376
Now a part of his family needs our help.

14:28.378 --> 14:31.296
This is our most important mission.

14:33.866 --> 14:35.050
Suit up.

14:46.396 --> 14:49.305
Okay. Well, he's not here.

on Felicity's list?

14:51.426 --> 14:53.050

14:53.052 --> 14:54.314
All right. Well, let's go.

14:54.317 --> 14:56.600
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

14:56.603 --> 14:59.481
You already did back
at the bunker, okay?

14:59.484 --> 15:02.393
I get it. You're sorry.

15:02.395 --> 15:04.079
No. I never told you why I left.

15:04.081 --> 15:06.564
And you don't need to.

15:06.566 --> 15:08.941
I understand. You were
going through a lot.

15:08.943 --> 15:11.861
Dying, getting resurrected,

15:11.863 --> 15:16.091
it gave me a whole new
perspective on... on everything,

15:16.093 --> 15:18.909
including you.

15:18.911 --> 15:20.828
You know, I got my whole life back,

15:20.830 --> 15:23.139
and I realized that
I wanted you in it...

15:24.601 --> 15:29.253
forever and... and always.

15:29.255 --> 15:32.005
And what does that mean?

15:32.008 --> 15:34.417
It means...

15:34.420 --> 15:36.962
Will you marry me?

some shots in the air.

16:05.809 --> 16:07.350
It's been a while.

16:08.937 --> 16:11.888
Yeah. Well, a while is what it took

16:11.890 --> 16:13.890

30:25.695 --> 30:27.671
For a long time...

30:29.866 --> 30:32.492
I hated Oliver Queen.

30:32.494 --> 30:39.090
I blamed him for the death
of my youngest daughter,

30:39.092 --> 30:43.878
I blamed him for the
violence in my city,

30:43.880 --> 30:48.007
I interrogated him, I hunted him,

30:48.009 --> 30:49.735
persecuted him.

30:52.439 --> 30:55.941
I've never been more wrong in my life.

30:55.943 --> 30:58.535
Oliver Queen wasn't just a hero.

31:01.188 --> 31:04.040
He was a good man.

31:04.043 --> 31:06.512
He was an honorable person.

31:06.515 --> 31:08.662
The fact that he didn't
start out that way

31:08.664 --> 31:11.906
makes him, in my book,

31:11.908 --> 31:14.718
even more honorable.

31:14.720 --> 31:18.663
He stands as a reminder to all of us

31:18.665 --> 31:20.641
that anyone can change.

32:10.517 --> 32:12.183
If Ollie could fix everything,

32:12.185 --> 32:16.304
then why couldn't he fix this?

32:16.306 --> 32:19.950
I think that Oliver could
only change the things

32:19.952 --> 32:22.643
that didn't change him,

something like this

Well, I just found out there's
a reality where I was dead,

33:15.156 --> 33:18.008
so that's the curve I'm
grading on these days.

for you to have a normal life.

in order to save his city,

37:01.716 --> 37:03.733
he had to become someone else,

37:03.735 --> 37:06.844
he had to become something else.

37:06.846 --> 37:09.072

becoming the Green Arrow,

37:09.074 --> 37:14.411

that meant becoming

37:17.065 --> 37:20.733
