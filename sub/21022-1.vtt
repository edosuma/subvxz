00:11.633 --> 00:13.933
No matter what the judge says,
I got your boobs.

00:13.933 --> 00:16.800
I got your boobs.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.767
Honk.
Honk.

00:17.767 --> 00:18.967
Oh, stand.

00:18.967 --> 00:19.967
Stand, stand.

00:19.967 --> 00:21.367
( CLEARS THROAT )

00:22.700 --> 00:23.967
Oh, we're sitting.
Do we sit?

00:23.967 --> 00:25.400
Before I read the verdict...

00:25.400 --> 00:27.367
would the defendants like
to address the court?

00:28.533 --> 00:30.333
I would, Your Honor!
That's too loud.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.567
Okay.
Proceed.

00:32.567 --> 00:34.267
First and foremost--
Volume.

00:35.533 --> 00:37.600
I am ready and willing...

00:37.600 --> 00:39.900
to receive any punishment
you see fit.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.367
You are as wise as you are
a... handsome woman.

00:46.767 --> 00:48.400
Secondly, I think it should...
Loud.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.633
be noted that I have never
been involved in any criminal...

00:51.633 --> 00:56.533
activity and I have made an
unbreakable pact with myself...

00:56.533 --> 00:59.900
that I will never do it again.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.767
Thirdly--

01:01.767 --> 01:04.267
Okay, I'd like to say something
that's very lawyer-y...

01:04.267 --> 01:05.067
and doesn't suck.

01:05.067 --> 01:06.300
Sorry, Billie.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.733
Woman judge, police male.

01:09.733 --> 01:13.800
Lady who keeps texting,
it is so rude.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.967
It's a stenographer.

01:14.967 --> 01:17.667
I stand before you a changed
woman.

01:17.667 --> 01:20.300
I have never had a friend
like the very butch woman...

01:20.300 --> 01:21.633
who's standing beside me.

01:21.633 --> 01:25.600
And we did this all in the
name of friendship. Okay?

01:25.600 --> 01:30.667
And if that is a crime,
if that is a crime...

01:30.667 --> 01:33.733
well, then I would strongly
recommend the death penalty...

01:33.733 --> 01:34.967
for Billie, thank you very much.

01:34.967 --> 01:37.833
What did you just say?
It's funny!

01:37.833 --> 01:39.067
No, it isn't.
You know, win 'em with charm!

01:39.067 --> 01:40.333
Enough.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.767
Wait! Your... handsome Honor--

01:43.767 --> 01:46.633
I would like to beg for your
pardon...

01:46.633 --> 01:49.067
as I have recently received
a position...

01:49.067 --> 01:52.067
at a small liberal arts college,
with which I intend to give...

01:52.067 --> 01:53.433
back to the community.

01:53.433 --> 01:56.067
I also foster several animals.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.833
Oh, I can tell by the look
on your face, that's a lie.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.300
Okay, Your Honor, side bar?

02:01.067 --> 02:02.767
I would also like to be
pardoned...

02:02.767 --> 02:05.800
because I plan on being
a vel-ebrity.

02:05.800 --> 02:06.933
Excuse me?

02:06.933 --> 02:08.733
A viral celebrity.

02:08.733 --> 02:11.500
I just have to shoot something
that goes viral and then bam.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.833
I've already sent my resume out
to YouTube, the web, Europe...

02:14.833 --> 02:16.367
the world wide web--

02:16.367 --> 02:17.833
Okay--
The internet, Seeso--

02:17.833 --> 02:20.533
Would you defendants please
return to your seats?

02:20.533 --> 02:21.500
So loud.

02:26.767 --> 02:27.500
Okay.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.333
Shit.
I'm gonna vomit.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.667
That's my Uncle Rico!

02:38.667 --> 02:40.733
There's no way you're related
to that man.

02:40.733 --> 02:43.400
Hi, Uncle Rico!
[JUDGE] I've reached a verdict.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.067
Not guilty on all charges.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.467
Justice!

02:49.600 --> 02:50.467
Right?

03:19.400 --> 03:20.700
Welcome back, Billie.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.833
Get out the way, bitch!

03:24.067 --> 03:25.633
That's Professor Bitch to you.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.133
Welcome to college, Gene.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.900
Step aside, bitch.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.500
Oh, it's Gene, not Mitch.

03:36.833 --> 03:40.067
Sorry. I was just watching
you read.

03:40.067 --> 03:41.567
That's weird.

03:42.833 --> 03:46.400
Books. Smells like home.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.700
O-sexual, bisexual, try-sexual,
I've been it all.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.933
I'm looking to get vi-sexual,
which is virally sexual.

03:51.933 --> 03:54.767
Not like masturbating in chat
rooms, or anything...

03:54.767 --> 03:56.467
just like filming sex
that goes wrong...

03:56.467 --> 03:57.767
and throwing it on the 'Tube.

03:57.767 --> 03:59.667
What's a chat room?

04:04.567 --> 04:05.833
Good morning.
Isn't it?

04:09.100 --> 04:10.733
Gene?

04:10.733 --> 04:12.067
Helen Hunt?

04:12.067 --> 04:14.867
Oh, my gosh! Billie, it's you!

04:14.867 --> 04:17.067
I thought for a second,
and I almost said something...

04:17.067 --> 04:19.100
that you were Helen Hunt.
You did say something.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.900
Oh, I should have gotten this
whole chance encounter on video.

04:21.900 --> 04:23.233
Can you go back and say
hashtag viral--

04:23.233 --> 04:25.100
What are you doing here?

04:25.100 --> 04:27.900
I go here. What's up?
They know me.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.533
Like one time you go here,
or you--

04:29.533 --> 04:33.200
No, I'm like a student.
Like, um-- oh here, like this.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.933
"Books, books, books..."

04:34.933 --> 04:37.167
Are you telling me that your dad
got you into the college...

04:37.167 --> 04:38.533
that I'm teaching at?

04:38.533 --> 04:40.767
Oh, like I need Kent Russell
to get me in.

04:40.767 --> 04:41.633
Higher on the left!

04:43.233 --> 04:44.667
Future Home of the--

04:44.667 --> 04:45.633
Can't--

04:45.633 --> 04:47.600
That could be a different dad.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.133
If your dad thinks that I'm just
going to take care of you...

04:50.133 --> 04:52.067
he is sorely mistaken.

04:52.067 --> 04:54.567
Gosh, you are obsessed with
talking about my dad right now.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.100
It's weird.
Okay, look--

04:56.100 --> 04:58.067
Sh-sh-shhh-- there's a cake-beef
walking up.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.633
Uh, hey, excuse me.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.067
Do you guys know where the
philosophy building is?

05:01.067 --> 05:02.833
Oh, I think the gym's that way.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.600
No, I was asking about the
philosophy building.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.133
I'm a mid-semester transfer.
Today's my first day.

05:07.133 --> 05:10.600
Me, too! Absolutely!

05:10.600 --> 05:12.933
Um, yeah... I'd love
to work out later.

05:12.933 --> 05:14.867
Maybe.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.700
Yeah. Oh, my gosh,
he's into me.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.667
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is the sorority rush?

05:20.667 --> 05:21.900
College joke.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.133
Okay, Gene, the last time
I saw you...

05:23.133 --> 05:24.900
you tried to get me
the death penalty.

05:24.900 --> 05:29.267
Billie, that was a courtroom gag
between old pals.

05:29.267 --> 05:32.700
Wait, wait! Okay, okay, look.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.567
The judge made me decide
between getting a job...

05:34.567 --> 05:35.767
or going back to school.

05:35.767 --> 05:39.167
So, now I'm trying the school...
way.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.100
I thought I'd go to the one
you went to--

05:40.100 --> 05:41.267
What are you saying?

05:41.267 --> 05:42.233
'Cause I wanna hang out
with you more.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.633
You're mumbling.

05:43.633 --> 05:47.967
So... where should I enroll your
bag? College joke.

05:47.967 --> 05:49.967
What are you doing?
What?

05:49.967 --> 05:53.200
Give it to me.
That's my winter clothes!

05:53.200 --> 05:55.067
That's my winter clothes!
That's my winter clothes.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.867
Don't you make fun of me.
That's my--

05:56.867 --> 05:58.533
Catch me, if you're my friend!
No!

06:00.200 --> 06:02.300
This can't be teacher housing.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.633
What? You live in a bar?

06:04.633 --> 06:08.267
You are so friggin' lucky.
I bet it's haunted, too.

06:11.067 --> 06:14.300
Ugh. You're totally gonna get
murdered in the coolest way.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.233
Shh!

06:17.600 --> 06:20.700
Excuse me? Excuse me?

06:20.700 --> 06:22.733
Hi, I'm looking for teacher
housing...

06:22.733 --> 06:23.733
and they gave me this address.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.833
Is he blind?

06:27.833 --> 06:29.167
Is it Dana?

06:29.167 --> 06:31.067
Oh, uh, yeah, it's--

06:31.067 --> 06:32.267
Dana's upstairs. Hang on.

06:32.267 --> 06:35.067
Hey, where's my [BLEEP]ing gum?

06:35.067 --> 06:36.600
[BILLIE] Who's he talking to?
[GENE] I don't know.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.967
Never mind.

06:37.967 --> 06:39.200
Gum was in his hand.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.600
I'm Dev, by the by.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.633
Oh, okay.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.133
No, thank you.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.633
I'd love to hear your story
some time, you know.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.867
I like to know the souls
that haunt this habitat.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.633
So there is ghosts?

06:51.633 --> 06:54.067
I own the bar, but it's
not mi pasion.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.700
Hm.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.067
Ten percent of the profits
go to buy make-up...

06:57.067 --> 06:58.700
for prostitutes in Calcutta.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.200
I'm out.
Holy sh--

07:00.200 --> 07:02.300
Tap. Excuse me.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.933
So Dana's up these stairs?

07:05.433 --> 07:07.067
Dana?

07:07.067 --> 07:08.933
Dana!

07:08.933 --> 07:14.267
Whoa... it smells like a
racquetball court, that's cool.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.733
Aw, look at this!

07:16.733 --> 07:20.067
Aw, you have a spatula that
looks like fried eggs. Nice.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.767
Why is there a Band-Aid
on the clock?

07:22.767 --> 07:25.733
Maybe 'cause it got a boo-boo.
College ghost joke.

07:25.733 --> 07:26.733
Hi.
Jesus!

07:28.333 --> 07:29.833
I'm Dana.

07:34.133 --> 07:37.500
Dana? Uh-- you're a... guy.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.400
I know. Sucks, right?

07:40.400 --> 07:41.967
I hate it.

07:41.967 --> 07:43.067
Why didn't you say something...

07:43.067 --> 07:45.100
when we were talking
in your apartment?

07:45.100 --> 07:49.167
Oh, well, I'm sorry, I, uh...

07:49.167 --> 07:54.733
I just didn't want to interrupt
your experience.

07:54.733 --> 07:55.933
I love your wig.
No, it's my hair.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.567
Um, I'm sorry, I, uh--

08:00.567 --> 08:04.200
I didn't realize teacher housing
would be above a bar...

08:04.200 --> 08:05.367
with a guy.

08:05.367 --> 08:07.233
Whoa, I'm a pretty staunch
feminist...

08:07.233 --> 08:08.700
and a gender studies
professor...

08:08.700 --> 08:11.267
so I don't love the
ochre of this conversation.

08:11.267 --> 08:12.233
This is great stuff.

08:12.233 --> 08:13.433
Stop it, stop it.

08:13.433 --> 08:16.100
I want you to know,
I respect you...

08:16.100 --> 08:17.900
and that's why I got you
a "welcome" t-shirt.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.867
On your bed, that's your bed.

08:19.867 --> 08:23.433
Oh... nice of you, I guess.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.900
Oh.
Mm.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.300
"Enough."

08:28.300 --> 08:30.133
Mm-hm. Every woman in my life
has one.

08:30.133 --> 08:31.433
Hey, Billie, can I keep this...

08:31.433 --> 08:32.900
'cause it looks sexy
on my body?

08:32.900 --> 08:34.133
What are you doing?
It looks right for my body.

08:34.133 --> 08:35.300
No, mine.
Is this is a dashiki?

08:35.300 --> 08:36.900
Yes, it's my dashiki.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.100
It looks good on my physique.
You've taken this before.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.233
This looks sexy on my body!
Stop it!

08:39.233 --> 08:41.133
Stop taking my things!

08:46.100 --> 08:48.067
I'm sorry, I think I just--

08:48.067 --> 08:50.567
I need a moment to myself,
please.

08:50.567 --> 08:52.467
Right, that would be great.

08:52.467 --> 08:55.300
I think she's talking to you.
Yeah.

08:55.300 --> 09:00.267
Oh, um-- right...
well, this is a big moment.

09:00.267 --> 09:02.067
I know you don't know, but--

09:02.067 --> 09:04.300
we've been friends for a very
long time, so to say goodbye--

09:04.300 --> 09:05.467
We haven't seen each other
in a long time--

09:05.467 --> 09:07.600
Goodbye?
Bye.

09:07.600 --> 09:12.533
Um... I guess I'll see you
never.

09:12.533 --> 09:15.100
I'll see you probably just like
walking around campus real soon.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.533

variety here.

09:24.233 --> 09:26.533
How about this? There you go.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.900

Yeah.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.933
Get your neck, yeah.

what? I've got a method.

20:24.533 --> 20:27.167
Oh, me.
Not me.

20:27.167 --> 20:29.233
Yeah! I got a surprise for you.

20:29.233 --> 20:32.033
Oh, it's not glasses, is it?

20:32.033 --> 20:33.867
Stop guessing, you asshole.
Hey.

20:33.867 --> 20:35.300
Follow me.
Whoa.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.200
Open sesame!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.467
Oh my gosh!

20:39.467 --> 20:41.833
Your very own office!

20:41.833 --> 20:43.033
How long have you known
this person?

20:43.033 --> 20:44.767
I just met her.
Mm-hm.

20:44.767 --> 20:47.533
I think I did it in a night.

20:47.533 --> 20:49.300
You are pretty lucky, Billie.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.100
You got some good friends.

20:51.100 --> 20:54.400
Yeah, I guess I, uh--
I guess I kinda do.

20:58.433 --> 21:02.067
She-- is she masturbating
on the edge of the desk?

21:02.067 --> 21:03.133
What?

21:03.133 --> 21:06.133
Staring straight at me.
Yeah.

21:06.133 --> 21:07.767
[BILLIE] Take a... train!
[GENE] Train!

21:16.633 --> 21:18.700
Do you need us here for the--

21:18.700 --> 21:20.600
Oh, that's gonna be a splinter.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.067
Almost done!

21:25.200 --> 21:27.100
Done.
