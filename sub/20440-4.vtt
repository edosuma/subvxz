WEBVTT

00:05.173 --> 00:07.441
- You, amigo.
- Yeah. Bueno.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.481
Whaddaya got?

00:13.547 --> 00:16.050
The best.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.419
Now, the, uh...

00:18.486 --> 00:21.255
red is for the pork,
green is for the chicken.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.628
Terry. Mm.
I mean--

00:27.695 --> 00:28.529
I know, right?

00:28.596 --> 00:30.798
I am serious.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.535
So, aside from, uh...

00:34.602 --> 00:39.740
me turning you on to
my favorite tamale truck.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.809
I need a sounding board.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.777
Somebody I can trust.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.580
You know, is a player but
isn't in the game anymore.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.317
- I'm the best you can do?
- Afraid so.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.085
Shoot.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.187
Caught one
the other day.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.622
Another detective
came to the scene,

00:54.688 --> 00:56.824
- you know, hard charger.
- Mm-hm.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.526
Guy I've known
for years.

00:58.592 --> 01:02.196
Process it, his prints
turn up on a glass.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.031
I ask him about it,

01:04.098 --> 01:05.833
he says he made
a mistake.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.968
Took off his glove.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.737
He's not the type.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.372
Anyone can make
a mistake.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.073
You think he
might be involved?

01:13.141 --> 01:15.343
The thought
crossed my mind.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.010
That's a dark
fuckin' thought.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.047
He's been after
this scumbag for years.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.049
Knows he did it,
knows in his bones.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.318
The way we do.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.753
Let's be honest.

01:25.819 --> 01:29.022
Who'd miss the creep?
Waste of fresh air.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.125
Let it go.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.026
You know me
better than that.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.829
Yeah. That's why
I retired early.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.064
You wore me out.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.099
Can't take it to
my lieutenant.

01:39.167 --> 01:42.270
She thinks this guy
walks on water.

01:42.336 --> 01:45.506
Look, Santiago.
Now, if you stir this shit,

01:45.573 --> 01:48.542
nobody will ever want to
work with you again, ever.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.580
I know it.

01:52.646 --> 01:56.950
So what you want to do
is kick it into the open
without your name on it.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.153
That way, it becomes
a command problem.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.454
You keep your
skirts clean.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.867
Dad!

02:13.934 --> 02:15.303
I'll be right there.

02:17.471 --> 02:21.108
How did he know
to come up behind you?

02:21.175 --> 02:23.377
- I don't know.
- There's nothing
you can think of

02:23.444 --> 02:25.179
might have blown
your cover?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.315
You know, fuck you, Moreno.

02:27.381 --> 02:30.184
I told you not to
underestimate him.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.921
Did he make you?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.889
No, he didn't
make me.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.527
Xavi, see what
you can find out.
If he made Woody,

02:39.593 --> 02:41.562
- I want to know.
- He didn't make me, goddamnit.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.232
- Find out where his head's at.
- You got it, Cap.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.267
No more fuck ups,
Woodrow.

02:48.969 --> 02:49.937
No, sir.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.845
Doing great.
Just keep an eye out for--

03:01.282 --> 03:03.551
- Slow down a little.
- Okay.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.388
For what?
An eye out for what?

03:07.455 --> 03:10.324
Trash day.
Cans.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.925
- Whoa!
- Shit.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.830
- You good?
- Yeah.

03:29.009 --> 03:32.145
Dad, I am so sorry.
I have absolutely no idea
what happened.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.881
- I--
- It's all right,
it's all right,

03:33.947 --> 03:35.449
It's not your fault.
It was my fault,

03:35.516 --> 03:37.885
I was distracted.
You know what I think?

03:37.951 --> 03:41.555
Reach in the glove box,
there should be a pen
and some paper.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.960
Just write a note,
give 'em my cell.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.363
Don't worry about the mirror,
it's just a mirror.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.332
Mirrors are replaceable.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.636
You were saying?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.538
- Hm?
- You think what?

03:59.139 --> 04:00.541
Yeah, I don't want you
home alone.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.443
I mean, just for
a couple of days

04:02.510 --> 04:04.011
after school,
hang out with friends,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.046
work in the library 'til
I can pick you up.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.881
Okay?

04:07.948 --> 04:10.384
Is this about last night?

04:10.451 --> 04:15.055
It's probably me just being
overprotective, but, yeah.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.090
You got home really late.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.493
Yeah. It was
a false alarm.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.094
Neighbor thought
she had a prowler.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.496
Well,
that's not scary at all.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.134
I've also been thinking
maybe it's not a bad idea

04:27.200 --> 04:30.304
to get you a real
driving instructor.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.173
If it's okay with you.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.309
You could put up
a small fight.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.010
That big.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.587
**

05:04.705 --> 05:07.207
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

05:07.274 --> 05:09.943
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

05:10.010 --> 05:12.680
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

05:12.746 --> 05:15.215
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

05:15.282 --> 05:18.051
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

05:18.118 --> 05:20.153
* Got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

05:20.220 --> 05:23.156
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

05:23.223 --> 05:26.159
* Can't let go *

05:26.226 --> 05:29.363
**

05:52.420 --> 05:53.621
Just a minute.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.592
Mrs. Niese?
Detective Bosch.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.794
Hollywood Division.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.195
- Tommy okay?
- He's fine.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.531
May I come in?

06:13.173 --> 06:15.409
Suit.
Must be serious.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.910
He's not in any kind of
trouble at all,

06:16.977 --> 06:19.913
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.550
I've gotta get ready
for work. You mind?

06:22.616 --> 06:23.717
Do what you need to do.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.686
I'm not gonna be
much help, anyway.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.622
I don't know where he is.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.223
When's the last time
you saw him?

06:30.290 --> 06:33.260
A month ago, maybe,
the last time you guys
brought him back.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.895
Stayed the night.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.564
Gone in the morning
before I got up.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.767
Raided my purse,
as usual.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.401
Any idea
who he hangs with?

06:41.469 --> 06:44.805
- Friends?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.875
First time he ran off,
he was 12.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.710
His life has been
a mystery to me ever since.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.812
On the streets,
living in--

06:51.879 --> 06:56.717
What do you call them?
Squats?

06:56.784 --> 06:59.186
Pain in my fuckin' ass.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.988
Judges me for how
I make a living.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.524
But you'd take him back
in a minute, wouldn't you?

07:03.591 --> 07:05.559
Probably, yeah.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.428
'Cause I'm, uh,
big-hearted.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.103
What do you think?

07:16.169 --> 07:18.405
- Nice.
- You're sweet.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.174
Not a very good liar,
but thanks.

07:21.241 --> 07:25.879
It's all about
the light.

07:25.946 --> 07:30.217
The right light will hide
a multitude of sins.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.055
Leave my card here
on the table.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.423
If he shows.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.658
He won't.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.661
Thanks.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.668
J. Edgar.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.570
The prints from
the RV door handle.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.404
One came back to
a juvenile.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.340
Thomas Niese.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.375
Sharkey.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.310
I got nothin' from his mom.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.713
Put the word out
to grab him up for
a little chat.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.849
I'm on my way back
from Northridge now.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.584
I'll organize
a search party.

08:06.854 --> 08:07.821
Billets.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.491
Lieutenant.
Scott Anderson, Times.

08:11.559 --> 08:12.960
What can I do for you,
Mr. Anderson?

08:13.026 --> 08:15.663
I'm writing a piece on
the Edward Gunn case.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.999
Well, you know
I can't comment on an
ongoing investigation.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.500
No comment required.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.069
I just need confirmation
on a tip I received.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.604
What's the tip?

08:23.671 --> 08:27.340
That you're investigating
one of your own people
for the murder.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.842
And who would that be?

08:28.909 --> 08:31.712
No name given.
A veteran officer.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.346
Mr. Anderson, uh,

08:33.413 --> 08:35.883
do you chase down
every crackpot tip
that you get?

08:35.949 --> 08:38.418
Lieutenant, this came from
someone in your department.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.053
Who?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.289
You know I can't
give you my source.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.058
So confirm or deny?

08:45.125 --> 08:47.828
The tip is bogus.
Have a blessed day.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.371
You're the man.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.373
Sweet!

09:14.521 --> 09:16.957
Let's go.
Off the bike.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.326
Come on.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.529
You two stay there.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.131
You know the deal.
Let's go. Get in.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.037
You just won the lottery.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.405
Harry's on the streets,
so I got an extra.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.107
Lottery, huh?

09:34.174 --> 09:35.643
That mean you get to walk
over to the coffee table,

09:35.709 --> 09:36.844
and get me two packs
of sugar?

09:36.910 --> 09:40.313
Way ahead of you,
brother.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.949
Appreciate it.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.150
What's going on
with Gunn?

09:43.216 --> 09:45.185
Beats me.
You have to ask
Robertson.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.588
Right now he has me
chasing down watch band
and bezel patterns.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.457
What's a bezel?

09:50.523 --> 09:54.194
The metal circle that secures
the crystal on a watch.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.395
What for?

09:55.462 --> 09:56.964
Marks on Gunn's
neck and back.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.766
Robertson thinks
choke hold, maybe.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.133
Like old school LAPD.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.502
You ever do that?
Choke somebody out?

10:02.569 --> 10:03.871
No, way before my time.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.206
Well, Robertson
seems to know
a lot about it.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.143
I don't know
what he's thinking.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.379
Give it time.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.546
If it's any consolation,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.248
I worked with Harry
for months

10:15.315 --> 10:18.285
before he trusted me enough
to even have a cup of coffee
with him.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.330
Sorry. Comin' in
from Northridge.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.600
What's in Northridge?

10:33.667 --> 10:34.968
His mother.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.403
You ought to call her.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.504
Why?
She don't care.

10:37.570 --> 10:38.806
You ought to call her.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.741
Need us to stay,
in case he gets frisky?

10:40.808 --> 10:44.444
No, I got this.
Thanks, Edge.

10:44.511 --> 10:45.679
Come here.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.459
We lifted your prints
off the RV door.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.493
You lied to me.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.662
Anything about
your story true?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.034
All right, I went
and I tried the door.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.136
All right?
Then I got out of there.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.470
You saw the body?

11:10.537 --> 11:11.772
Yeah, I did.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.007
I freaked and I split.
That's all.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.743
Okay, look,
you're not a suspect.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.677
I just need
some help here is all.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.948
Nobody's gonna
ever know we talked.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.950
Wouldn't hurt you to have
a friend in the department.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.224
Yeah, so I'm taggin',
all right?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.059
A car pulls up.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.560
Black SUV
you told me about.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.495
Someone gets out,
they go in,

11:35.562 --> 11:37.330
they come right back out,
like, a minute later,

11:37.397 --> 11:38.398
they take off.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.068
- You saw all this?
- No, I heard it, okay?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.403
I was fuckin' hiding.
I didn't see shit.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.940
So, the car pulls up.
How many people in it,
could you tell?

11:47.007 --> 11:48.275
I don't know man.
Look, I hid as soon as

11:48.341 --> 11:50.811
I saw the headlights
coming my way.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.245
They see you?

11:52.312 --> 11:55.548
I don't think so,
I'm pretty quick.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.884
So, what else?

11:59.586 --> 12:01.088
All right,
I heard a thud.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.557
Right? Like...
something getting
knocked over.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.692
Kind of muffled.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.995
Like a gunshot?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.530
Could have been.
I don't know.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.633
Okay, so they split.
And then what?

12:13.700 --> 12:15.135
Then I went,
I looked in the RV.

12:15.202 --> 12:19.139
All right, and I got
the fuck out of there.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.075
Shit, man,
I knew I should have
called 9-1-1.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.312
- Didn't want to snitch.
- No, I didn't.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.347
And I didn't want
to get blamed
for it, either.

12:27.414 --> 12:31.084
I get that. Let's go.
I'll give you a lift.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.213
Yeah,
but this is major, Brad.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.215
A suspected serial killer
murdered,

13:02.282 --> 13:03.616
and the cops are looking at
one of their own.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.418
You don't buy the denial.

13:05.485 --> 13:09.022
Shit. For me,
it just confirms we're
on the right track.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.358
Call me old fashioned,
but we need a second source.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.127
Not just click bait
we have to walk back
by Friday.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.662
Who do you think
they're looking at?

13:15.728 --> 13:18.331
My source didn't
give me a name.
A veteran officer.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.834
- Your source inside
the department?
- Correct.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.202
You call Bosch?

13:22.269 --> 13:23.703
He knows the Gunn case
better than anyone.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.906
Bosch will tell me
to fuck off.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.108
I'd characterize that
as decline to comment.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.077
Still, doesn't he owe us?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.879
Didn't Russell help him
solve his mother's murder?

13:31.945 --> 13:34.381
I'm not sure he
sees it that way.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.548
You're creative.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.684
You'll think of something.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.386
What if it's him?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.454
Who, Bosch?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.790
Yeah.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.493
What if he's
the veteran officer?

13:46.559 --> 13:48.828
Then he'll definitely
tell you to fuck off.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.568
Here you go.

13:55.635 --> 13:56.603
Thank you.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.910
So, you think it's Jimmy.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.279
I don't picture Pierce
tipping that reporter.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.882
I'm sure he knows by now
Harry's been stalking Gunn
for years.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.084
What else has Jimmy got?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.686
He noticed marks on
Gunn's neck and back.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.222
Possible choke hold.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.493
He told Pierce he thinks
it could be connected to
law enforcement.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.096
Oh, Christ.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.532
And what do you have
that Jimmy doesn't?

14:25.598 --> 14:28.135
A surveillance camera
I found in Gunn's apartment.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.703
And I found something else
that night.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.506
- An owl.
- An owl?

14:34.174 --> 14:36.043
Plastic garden owl.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.246
I think
somebody put it there
the night of the murder.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.580
There was
a message on it.

14:40.647 --> 14:45.318
Cave Cave Deus Videt.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.419
I Googled it.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.821
- It's Latin.
- What does it mean?

14:48.888 --> 14:52.859
Beware, beware,
God sees.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.695
Like God is watching.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.764
Watching what?

14:57.830 --> 14:58.932
Gunn.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.733
His sins.
His evil doings.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.903
His rapes and murders.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.373
Guess which 15th century
Dutch artist

15:06.439 --> 15:08.575
painted that phrase
on a table top.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.879
Hieronymus Bosch.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.150
So, what, Harry Bosch,
the avenging angel?

15:17.217 --> 15:18.785
Something like that.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.587
Least we're meant
to think so.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.289
What, that Harry killed Gunn?

15:22.355 --> 15:23.623
Why would he point
the finger at himself?

15:23.690 --> 15:24.724
He wouldn't.
It's a frame.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.359
The question is,
who would?

15:26.426 --> 15:30.297
Who would go through
all that trouble
to frame him?

15:33.100 --> 15:36.036
The Holland trial.
Smear Bosch.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.871
Andrew Holland.
Thinks he's clever.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.173
Thinks he's
making a movie.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.209
Oh, my God.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.278
Have you talked
to Harry yet?

15:45.345 --> 15:47.180
Not yet.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.548
Jerry, you've gotta
talk to him.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.284
You've got to tell him
what's going on.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.652
I know.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.897
You have five messages.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.700
Detective Bosch, this is
Sergeant Amy Snyder, IA.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.303
- Please call me b--
- Message deleted.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.905
Hello, Mr. Bosch,
this is Rich Isbin.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.243
- You might remember me
from--
- Message deleted.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.345
Detective Bosch,
Amy Snyder again.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.613
- Please give me a--
- Messaged deleted.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.814
Bosch, you putz.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.550
This is your old pal,
Rick Jackson.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.252
Your current partner
came to see me

16:25.318 --> 16:28.055
about you and your
girlfriend Eddie Gunn.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.190
He asked me
not to tell you.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.724
Thought you
ought to know.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.564
Message saved.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.466
Detective Bosch,
Scott Anderson.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.069
I'd really appreciate
a few minutes of your time.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.303
You have my number.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.307
Message deleted.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.109
No more messages.

17:00.953 --> 17:04.091
**

17:44.731 --> 17:45.898
Hey, Harry.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.000
J. Edgar.
How was the Getty?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.269
What?

17:49.336 --> 17:50.703
The other day when
I met with Goshen,

17:50.770 --> 17:52.972
you were off the radar.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.308
Oh, I told you,
I had a dental thing.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.676
I've been meaning to
get up there with Maddie.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.411
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it is.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.714
Oh, so you were
up there.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.351
Just had to get away,
think about some things.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.485
Cell phone reception
was shitty.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.487
That's why
I missed your call.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.088
You know what?
Don't insult me with
your fuckin' lies.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.857
Really, Jerry?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.826
You're investigating me
for Gunn's murder?
I'm a suspect?

18:13.893 --> 18:15.562
No. I think
you're being set up.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.297
- You think?
- I know you're being set up.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.998
When were you planning to
tell me this, partner?

18:19.065 --> 18:21.301
Now.
Why I'm here.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.535
I just finished
filling Billets in.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.372
Oh, so she's
in on this, too?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.639
Why didn't you
come to me first?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.975
I had to know exactly
what was going on.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.511
You needed to make sure
I didn't kill Gunn?
Are you serious?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.646
I know you didn't
kill Gunn.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.649
- I was following the evidence.
- Fuck you.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.218
Harry,
I'm not the only one
looking into this.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.086
Who, Robertson?
It's his case.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.388
He's gotta do
what he's gotta do,

18:41.454 --> 18:42.655
but he's not my partner.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.791
- I never thought you--
- No, you know what?

18:44.857 --> 18:46.559
We still gotta work
the Meadows case together.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.595
After that,
maybe it's time
for a change.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.030
Tomorrow morning,
call Scott Anderson.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.799
Get to the bottom
of this bullshit.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.301
Morning, gentlemen.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.936
Thanks for meeting me.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.705
Before we start,
I need to know where
the tip came from.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.408
You know I can't do that.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.879
Look, I just need
confirmation.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.015
You guys investigating
somebody within LAPD
for Gunn's murder?

19:43.082 --> 19:44.183
I just need to know
your source.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.552
Not gonna happen.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.354
Look, I'm trying to
spare you some grief here,

19:47.420 --> 19:49.789
because if you run this story
without confirmation,

19:49.856 --> 19:50.857
you'll regret it.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.191
Are you
threatening me?

19:52.259 --> 19:53.926
Not at all, just
giving you a reality check.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.062
- The tip is wrong.
- If you fall for it,

19:56.128 --> 19:57.364
you're gonna
look like a fool.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.898
It's a career ender.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.533
So is giving up
my source.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.304
One guess, one name,
yes or no.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.974
What do I get in return?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.109
First call.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.244
Whole story on Gunn.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.912
Whole story.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.450
- One name?
- That's it.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.420
All right.
Take a guess.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.789
Jimmy Robertson.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.827
- No?
- No.

20:30.997 --> 20:31.964
Not Robertson.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.066
First call, right?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.268
That's the deal.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.304
Great. And if I get
another source,

20:37.370 --> 20:39.706
I'll just run with
the story.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.745
He was a little late
with a smile.

21:18.177 --> 21:21.648
- Hello, CRT.
- This is Chief Irving.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.250
I'm trying to reach
one of your CRT volunteers.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.753
Okay. Can I have
the last name, please?

21:26.819 --> 21:29.689
- Jun Park.
- Okay. I have
that number here.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.524
Yeah, go ahead.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.362
Jimmy. Need a word.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.034
- Wait in my office.
- I need to talk to him.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.970
I need to
talk to him first.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.076
You leaked an
active investigation
to a fuckin' reporter.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.478
- It wasn't me.
- Bullshit.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.845
Yeah, bullshit is right.
Where'd you get that?

21:52.912 --> 21:54.381
- Scott Anderson.
- Wait.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.548
He said that Jimmy
was his source?

21:55.615 --> 21:57.750
- He denied it.
- There you go.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.852
He's a fuckin' liar.
It was written all over
his face.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.854
- It's you.
- Go fuck yourself.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.190
All right, you know what?
Stand down, both of you.

22:04.256 --> 22:07.494
My office,
Monday morning, we will
straighten all this out.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.995
Take the weekend
to cool off.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.566
I'm following
the evidence, Bosch.

22:13.633 --> 22:14.901
I sure as hell
don't want to see it

22:14.967 --> 22:17.770
buried by your friends
in the department.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.807
You're on very thin ice.
Not another word.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.614
And you have
impeccable timing.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.315
Sergeant Snyder
is in my office.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.719
Did you okay J. Edgar
doing an off the books
investigation on Gunn?

22:32.785 --> 22:33.820
On me?

22:33.886 --> 22:35.955
You were never
a suspect, Harry.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.957
We were concerned about
where this might lead.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.959
All right, we were
trying to protect you.

22:40.026 --> 22:40.993
Tell her I'm busy.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.491
I hope
everything's all right.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.060
Woody's a good tenant.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.728
Quiet.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.664
Just a few
routine questions.

23:21.367 --> 23:22.569
Woody.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.037
Woody!

23:29.108 --> 23:30.943
Surf's up somewhere.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.212
Rincon. Trestles.

23:33.279 --> 23:37.283
Sometimes he takes off for
Mexico, Baja, San Blas.

23:37.349 --> 23:40.319
Maybe he's just down at
Espresso Yourself
on the boardwalk.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.154
Any idea when
he'll be back?

23:42.221 --> 23:45.091
Could be 30 minutes
or 30 days.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.258
You never know.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.828
Tell him it's about
Billy Meadows.

23:50.730 --> 23:53.032
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thank you.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.448
You ever surf?

24:11.818 --> 24:15.254
Is this "let's pretend
we're partners again"
small talk?

24:15.321 --> 24:18.057
- Yeah.
- No.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.861
No, you never surfed,
or no, you're not ready
for partner small talk?

24:21.928 --> 24:23.530
Both.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.470
Call these sculptures
"Memories of the 'Stan."

24:31.538 --> 24:33.005
Tribute to the fallen
of my unit.

24:33.072 --> 24:36.543
This is Danny.
He rides a wheelchair now.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.511
He was lucky.
Still got his balls.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.749
ID any of these guys?

24:45.084 --> 24:46.886
Quarles and Tuck.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.255
Dumb fucks. Re-enlisted.
They're in Kandahar.

24:49.321 --> 24:53.593
Here's your boy Meadows.
Wasn't surprised when I heard.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.995
Billy was living on
borrowed time.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.463
He was tight with
these three.

24:57.530 --> 25:00.466
Captain Dobbs.
Xavi Moreno.
Woody Woodrow.

25:00.533 --> 25:04.904
Four amigos.
Fearless motherfuckers.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.506
How about this?

25:09.241 --> 25:10.577
So much cash
floating around
back then.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.378
Most of it got diverted.

25:12.444 --> 25:15.848
Corrupt motherfuckers.
Supposed to go for
schools and sewers.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.283
Not to sound
too sanctimonious,

25:17.349 --> 25:19.385
at lot of us lined up for
our turn at the trough, too.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.987
How so?

25:21.053 --> 25:23.322
Oh, everybody had
a little side action
going on.

25:23.389 --> 25:26.458
Uh, arms, drugs, cash.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.795
I heard tell of
a Jeep shipped home

25:28.861 --> 25:31.430
with gold stashed in
every nook and cranny.

25:31.497 --> 25:34.233
How do you get a Jeep
stuffed with gold
through customs?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.903
You don't.
You go through
military channels.

25:36.969 --> 25:37.937
You know, "Thank you for
your service, son."

25:38.004 --> 25:39.906
They just
wave it on through.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.974
All you need is
one guy on that end
to put it on the boat,

25:42.041 --> 25:44.343
and one guy on this end
to take it off.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.313
Those guys come cheap.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.380
How about her?

25:48.447 --> 25:50.082
She was on the base.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.483
Didn't know her.
Couldn't tell you
her name.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.752
Was she tight
with Meadows?

25:52.819 --> 25:55.087
If they were,
they kept it a secret.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.189
You gonna make
one of these for Meadows?

25:57.256 --> 26:00.627
He's a casualty of
that fuckin' war,
isn't he?

26:00.693 --> 26:03.529
De Oppresso Liber.
Billy Meadows.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.665
De Oppresso Liber.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.767
I've had to make
far too many of those calls

26:07.834 --> 26:10.169
- over the years.
- Yeah.

26:10.236 --> 26:14.140
You think it would
get easier, but, um--

26:14.206 --> 26:16.308
I'm afraid I'm still not
very good at it.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.645
From what I saw,
I think you are.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.481
Can I, um...

26:22.548 --> 26:23.650
ask you a question?

26:23.716 --> 26:26.619
Yeah, sure.

26:26.686 --> 26:29.355
I have to make
those calls.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.859
Pay my respects to
victim's families,
officer's families.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.327
Uh, are you asking me
why I do CRT?

26:35.394 --> 26:37.429
I'm curious.

26:37.496 --> 26:41.734
Many CRT volunteers
have some...

26:41.801 --> 26:45.304
direct experience with
this sort of loss.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.706
It gives them empathy.

26:49.241 --> 26:52.211
- Um--
- I'm sorry, it's
none of my business.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.715
I watched you
with that family,

26:55.782 --> 26:57.116
and I just thought,
uh--

26:57.183 --> 26:58.918
That we might have
something in common?

27:02.154 --> 27:03.155
Yeah, I guess.

27:08.427 --> 27:09.929
My little brother.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.665
Gunned down
in a drive-by.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.802
Four ABZ gangsters.
Kids his age.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.571
I'm so sorry.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.473
Killed my father.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.043
He died
nine months later,

27:24.110 --> 27:28.681
and then my mother,
she moved back to Seoul
to live with her sister.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.249
But you stayed.

27:30.316 --> 27:34.186
Yeah, this is my city,
I grew up here.

27:34.253 --> 27:37.623
A friend told me about CRT,
and I thought,

27:37.690 --> 27:40.192
maybe, just maybe,
it would--

27:40.259 --> 27:42.094
And I was right.

27:42.161 --> 27:46.398
Trying to help other people,
it helps me somehow.

27:46.465 --> 27:49.201
At least sometimes.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.838
I'm sure you know what
all that feels like, yeah?

27:53.505 --> 27:55.174
Yes. I do.

27:58.144 --> 28:01.781
You know, I, um--

28:01.848 --> 28:04.416
I haven't been on a date
in 30 years.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.418
- Um--
- Is, um--

28:06.485 --> 28:08.287
Is that what this is,
a date?

28:08.354 --> 28:09.555
Oh, Lord, no.
I mean--

28:09.621 --> 28:11.323
Uh--
Uh--

28:15.227 --> 28:17.864
But if I were to
ask you out...

28:23.469 --> 28:25.137
What have you
got to lose?

28:35.782 --> 28:37.750
Good luck with
your witness.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.819
What you workin' on?

28:39.886 --> 28:41.287
Science fair thing
with Jack.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.756
Hasn't managed to
blow up the school yet?

28:43.823 --> 28:45.024
Workin' on it.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.370
Wait.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.706
Was that small talk?

29:00.773 --> 29:02.474
Hi, this is Annabelle.
Leave a message.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.978
Annabelle,
this is Anita again.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.814
We're still
waiting on you.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.581
Please call us,
let us know what's
going on.

29:09.648 --> 29:11.183
Thank you.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.285
I have a bad feeling
about this.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.887
What if something
happened to her?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.522
You want I should
go check?

29:16.588 --> 29:17.589
Do you mind?

29:17.656 --> 29:19.225
Let me go see if
I can find her.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.295
Car service for
Mr. Jack Edgar.

29:56.362 --> 29:57.763
Thank you for
doing this for me.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.198
Of course.
All set?

30:04.136 --> 30:06.973
Hey, champ.
Ready?

30:07.039 --> 30:08.540
Science fair awaits.

30:08.607 --> 30:09.808
Don't you want to
see it first?

30:09.876 --> 30:13.212
Absolutely. Go slow.
Remember your audience.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.981
Dad, it's simple.
Really.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.782
Remember that PEM?

30:16.849 --> 30:18.084
Slow.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.818
Polymer electrolyte
membrane.

30:19.886 --> 30:21.921
You got it for me online.
It cost $87.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.923
I remember that.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.791
I used it to make
a hydrogen fuel cell

30:25.858 --> 30:27.259
that propels
the vehicle.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.861
- All I do is add water--
- Mm-hm.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.898
The cell separates into
hydrogen and oxygen.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.937
Zoom, zoom.

30:38.004 --> 30:41.373
So, add water.
Zoom, zoom.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.043
- Just water.
- And the flashing lights?

30:44.110 --> 30:45.978
Gotta look cool.

30:46.045 --> 30:49.581
Very cool, kid.
Very cool.

30:54.921 --> 30:57.123
Annabelle.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.025
You forgot our
appointment.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.192
How did you find me?

31:00.259 --> 31:01.427
Your neighbor
ratted you out.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.929
Get dressed.
I'll wait for you.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.563
I can't today.
I have a date.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.366
Name a time.
I'll pick you up
any day this week.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.168
Do we have to?
I already told you everything.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.070
- I swear, there's--
- Not everything.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.638
And yes, we have to.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.673
Make sure you're ready
for trial.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.643
Listen, uh,
I've changed my mind.
I can't do it.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.911
- Annabelle.
- I can't.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.246
I've decided
not to testify.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.885
They found out,
didn't they?

31:26.953 --> 31:29.721
- What?
- What you do.

31:29.788 --> 31:32.058
In your other life.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.559
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.094
Leah Camille.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.599
They'll crucify me
in court.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.800
Not if we
bring it up first.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.735
Get it out of the way.

31:43.802 --> 31:44.971
Admit it and move on.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.338
And everyone will know
I'm a whore.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.675
I understand why
you didn't tell us.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.610
Please,
you have no idea.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.479
Actually, I do.

31:55.781 --> 31:59.751
When you came to us,
that took a tremendous
amount of courage.

31:59.818 --> 32:01.620
I guess.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.855
You told us you thought if
you'd come forward sooner,

32:03.922 --> 32:05.024
that Donatella might
still be alive.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.558
And what did I tell you?

32:06.625 --> 32:09.561
- That it wasn't my fault.
- And it wasn't.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.697
But if Andrew Holland
gets off,

32:11.763 --> 32:12.931
he'll do it again.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.235
I'm sorry.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.808
Somebody got to her.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.043
She say who?

32:24.110 --> 32:26.878
No. Must be
Holland's people.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.847
His lawyer or Rudy Tafero.

32:28.914 --> 32:31.417
O'Shea is gonna
shit a brick.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.618
I feel his pain.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.327
Uh-huh.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.532
What if the kid did?

32:49.868 --> 32:51.037
What if he saw me?

32:54.606 --> 32:55.607
Break.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.487
Will you relax?
He didn't.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.955
So why does he keep
talking to him?

33:10.022 --> 33:12.524
'Cause he's got
nothin' else.

33:12.591 --> 33:13.559
Nada.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.230
Kid's not a problem.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.241
- Yo, Merch.
- Woody Woodrow.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.342
- My brother.
- What's up, brother?

33:30.409 --> 33:32.578
Hey.

33:35.781 --> 33:36.748
You're late.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.787
- So, Merch.
- Captain D.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.756
- How's it hangin'?
- Shit. You tell me.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.532
This puppy is wired,
end to end.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.234
You got us?

33:55.301 --> 33:58.036
- Same as always.
- Ah, go Army.

33:58.104 --> 34:00.306
Then we are golden.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.674
Rock and roll,
brother.

34:34.706 --> 34:37.776
Hey, Maddie, your
driving instructor's here.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.145
Coming.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.283
Be a good listener,
and drive carefully.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.485
Well, it's easy if
your dad isn't clutching
the dashboard

34:46.552 --> 34:48.420
like the plane's
going down in flames.

34:48.487 --> 34:49.855
Much easier for
your dad, too.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.858
Hey, you been messin' around
with my shrine here?

34:52.924 --> 34:53.992
No. Why?

34:54.059 --> 34:55.894
No reason.

34:55.961 --> 34:57.763
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.282
Got a warrant?

35:50.349 --> 35:51.883
I don't need a warrant for
what I'm gonna do to you

35:51.950 --> 35:53.485
if you ever
toss my house again.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.354
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

35:55.421 --> 35:57.055
Find what you were
lookin' for?

35:57.122 --> 35:58.324
You're losing
your shit, Bosch.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.425
I don't know who
stalked your house.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.792
And stay away from
Annabelle Crowe

36:00.859 --> 36:02.828
or I'll have the DA
ring you up for tampering.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.663
I haven't talked to her,
I haven't touched her,

36:04.730 --> 36:06.698
I haven't tampered with her,
much as I'd like to.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.301
Bullshit. Do not
go near her again,

36:09.368 --> 36:10.936
and do not contact her
in any way.

36:11.002 --> 36:11.970
You got that?

36:12.037 --> 36:12.904
Anything else?

36:12.971 --> 36:14.873
My daughter, my house,

36:14.940 --> 36:16.975
out of fuckin' bounds!

36:17.042 --> 36:18.844
We clear?

36:18.910 --> 36:20.412
Or what?

36:20.479 --> 36:22.781
Or you won't see me comin'
'til it's over.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.684
Bosch, I got 20 years
on the job.

36:25.751 --> 36:28.019
You really think I couldn't
creep your crib

36:28.086 --> 36:30.856
without leaving
footprints?

36:30.922 --> 36:32.291
Wasn't me, brother.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.482
Hey.
Look alive.

37:05.424 --> 37:08.827
- Hey. How's it goin'?
- It's goin'.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.429
What up?

37:10.496 --> 37:13.965
Not much.
Out for a ride.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.301
You in the mood
for a ride?

37:17.336 --> 37:18.537
Where to?

37:18.604 --> 37:21.072
I don't know.
There's a place.

37:21.139 --> 37:23.141
Not too far.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.476
Little more private.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.879
Anything in particular?

37:28.947 --> 37:31.817
I hope you're
bilingual.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.520
Yeah, I am,
if the money's right.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.188
Look, you're gonna have
such a good time,

37:37.255 --> 37:38.690
you're gonna pay me.

37:40.626 --> 37:41.593
Cool.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.038
So, where we goin'?

37:53.104 --> 37:55.006
There's a nice place.

37:55.073 --> 37:56.308
Nobody will bother us.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.904
What was that?

38:25.971 --> 38:29.341
Wouldn't you rather have fun
than wait at a light?

38:29.408 --> 38:30.576
Me, too.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.460
Have we met before?

38:51.196 --> 38:52.598
Pretty sure not.

39:09.648 --> 39:10.949
I like you,
Sharkey.

39:12.384 --> 39:13.552
How do you know that?

39:14.486 --> 39:16.388
Because...

39:16.455 --> 39:17.756
this has your name on it.

39:40.045 --> 39:43.114
**

39:46.418 --> 39:48.386
Bosch.

39:48.454 --> 39:51.590
That kid you've been
dealing with, Thomas Niese.

39:51.657 --> 39:54.426
Yeah.
Where is he?

39:54.493 --> 39:57.729
Pedestrian tunnel at
the Hollywood Bowl.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.400
- Harry.
- Yeah. On my way.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.614
It's open.

40:15.681 --> 40:16.815
Mads,
sorry to wake you up.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.717
I gotta go out.
Won't take long.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.586
It's not my case,
but I'm gonna go
take a look,

40:20.652 --> 40:21.820
so get dressed.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.857
- A crime scene?
- Crime scene.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.759
- Cool.
- No, it's-- it's not cool.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.795
That's why you're gonna be
waiting in the car.

40:30.462 --> 40:31.697
Dad.

41:06.632 --> 41:07.899
So much blood.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.004
That's what happens when
the bleeders are cut.

41:54.245 --> 41:55.213
Dad?

41:59.517 --> 42:01.152
You okay?

42:01.219 --> 42:02.520
Let's go home.

42:16.602 --> 42:19.738

42:34.519 --> 42:37.656
