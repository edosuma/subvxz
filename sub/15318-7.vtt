01:57.100 --> 02:02.337
I don't know.
"Coming in from the cold?"

02:02.338 --> 02:03.872
I just feel like I'm in

02:03.873 --> 02:06.879
some sort of pulp spy
novel from the '50s

02:06.943 --> 02:08.477
when you use
those expressions.

02:08.478 --> 02:10.079
And what's wrong
with that?

02:10.169 --> 02:11.636
Nothing.

02:11.637 --> 02:12.837
I just think maybe we
could use expressions

02:12.838 --> 02:14.972
that are from
this century,

02:14.973 --> 02:17.875
for those of us who were
born more recently.

02:17.876 --> 02:20.611
Yeah, but "seeking sanctuary"
feels kind of on the nose.

02:20.612 --> 02:22.747
Okay, well, how about
we use Mafia terms, right?

02:22.748 --> 02:23.815
They're timeless.

02:23.816 --> 02:26.284
Like "he's gotta
get off the street,"

02:26.285 --> 02:30.054
or, you know, "no,
no, no, no, no, no

02:30.055 --> 02:31.989
Frankie's going south."

02:31.990 --> 02:35.526
Yes, Frankie will
feel very safe with us.

02:37.529 --> 02:38.930
Here it is.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.835
Hardly worth it, really.

02:43.836 --> 02:45.169
All right, I'm thinking

02:45.170 --> 02:47.038
this guy's some sort
of lizard-type person.

02:47.039 --> 02:48.606
Doesn't hide well
in public.

02:48.607 --> 02:50.708
Hence the stinky out-of-the-way
meeting spot.

02:50.709 --> 02:53.511
His message
didn't specify his race.

02:53.512 --> 02:54.545
Just that he needed our help.

02:54.546 --> 02:56.647
You always think amphibian?

02:56.648 --> 02:57.582
When I don't know
what the creature is?

02:57.583 --> 02:58.449
Yeah, I always go there.

02:58.450 --> 02:59.317
Huh. Me too.

03:02.187 --> 03:03.287
You two
take the upper floors.

03:03.288 --> 03:05.756
Stay in radio contact.

03:05.757 --> 03:06.991
All right.

03:06.992 --> 03:08.559
And could you both
try to be a bit more...

03:08.560 --> 03:09.660
Welcoming?

03:09.661 --> 03:11.028
Yes.

03:11.029 --> 03:13.865
Especially if he does
end up being a lizard.

03:17.302 --> 03:20.238
Hello?

03:20.239 --> 03:24.108
Anybody here?

03:24.109 --> 03:26.744
Why ask for help
and then not show up?

03:26.745 --> 03:28.112
Fear, maybe.

03:28.113 --> 03:29.814
Of what?

03:29.815 --> 03:33.684
That's a good
freaking question.

03:35.220 --> 03:37.121
Hello!

03:38.857 --> 03:41.192
Come on out, little buddy.

03:41.193 --> 03:42.960
We're friendly.

03:45.030 --> 03:45.997
Just trying to be
welcoming.

03:45.998 --> 03:47.665
Yeah.

03:47.666 --> 03:49.667
Nothing.

03:51.937 --> 03:53.237
Oh, wait.

03:53.238 --> 03:55.273
Huh.

03:55.274 --> 03:57.341
Scanner's not liking
something in here.

03:57.342 --> 04:00.378
Yeah, it's
em interference.

04:00.379 --> 04:03.047
There's a power station nearby.
Could be that.

04:03.048 --> 04:05.917
Or maybe someone doesn't
want fish man found.

04:05.918 --> 04:06.751
Yeah.

04:10.789 --> 04:14.158
Doesn't look like
anyone's been in here in years.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.029
Is your scanner acting up?

04:18.029 --> 04:20.130
Yeah, getting
weird power spikes,

04:20.132 --> 04:21.866
but then it corrects.

04:21.867 --> 04:25.269
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this place.

04:25.270 --> 04:28.105
Thank you
for saying it.

04:28.106 --> 04:30.174
Okay, we swept
the third and fourth floor.

04:30.175 --> 04:34.111
If our friend was here,
I think he got cold feet.

04:34.112 --> 04:36.314
Can't imagine why.

04:36.315 --> 04:38.582
Plus, I hate this place.

04:38.583 --> 04:39.417
Amen.

04:41.653 --> 04:43.120
All right.

04:43.121 --> 04:44.288
Meet me
back at the main entrance.

04:52.164 --> 04:54.732
With pleasure.

04:56.401 --> 04:57.702
I'll have Henry
run a diagnostic

04:57.703 --> 04:59.036
on the scanner
malfunctions.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.338
Who knows, maybe
"seriously creepy"

05:00.339 --> 05:01.806
is a parameter.

05:01.807 --> 05:03.741
The guy got afraid
and didn't show.

05:03.742 --> 05:04.675
Where's the mystery?

05:06.111 --> 05:07.111
Katie...

05:07.112 --> 05:08.112
There's always
a mystery.

05:08.113 --> 05:11.148
Uh-huh. That's adorable.

05:11.149 --> 05:12.984
I say if Mr. shy guy
really wants our help,

05:12.985 --> 05:14.352
he'll reach out.

05:14.353 --> 05:17.722
Until then, as much
as I love it here...

05:17.723 --> 05:19.857
Unless he was trying
to warn us.

05:19.858 --> 05:20.992
Of what?

05:20.993 --> 05:22.126
I don't know.

05:22.127 --> 05:23.160
There's something odd
going on here.

05:23.161 --> 05:24.328
I can't quite
put my finger on it.

05:24.329 --> 05:26.797
Yeah. This whole building
has weird juju,

05:26.798 --> 05:28.065
like people died here.

05:32.671 --> 05:33.838
You want to stay?

05:33.839 --> 05:34.739
We can have Henry
and the big guy

05:34.740 --> 05:36.273
scan the place
from top to bottom.

05:36.274 --> 05:39.210
No, no, we'll head back.

05:39.211 --> 05:41.812
I've left Tesla alone
in the library too long.

05:41.813 --> 05:43.147
We'll come back later
with a full complement.

05:43.148 --> 05:45.216
Who wants
a late breakfast?

05:45.217 --> 05:46.450
I'm starved.

05:46.451 --> 05:49.420
Ooh, yeah.
Food is a great call.

05:52.457 --> 05:54.291
Oh, come on.

05:54.292 --> 05:56.027
Will!

05:56.028 --> 05:57.294
Kate!

05:57.295 --> 05:59.196
So I heard this
killer joke yesterday.

05:59.197 --> 06:00.464
Hit me.

06:00.465 --> 06:02.099
Okay. Knock knock.

06:02.100 --> 06:02.900
You serious?

06:02.901 --> 06:03.901
Just go with it,
William.

06:03.902 --> 06:04.769
Okay. Who's there?

06:13.445 --> 06:16.447
Bloody hell.

06:43.108 --> 06:46.177
What in God's name?

08:06.825 --> 08:08.225
Will?

08:08.226 --> 08:10.361
Kate?

08:39.024 --> 08:41.258
Hello?

08:51.369 --> 08:54.505
Show yourself.

08:54.506 --> 08:56.006
The only reason we're here

08:56.007 --> 08:59.109
is because
you called us for help.

09:23.068 --> 09:25.169
Where are you?

09:28.540 --> 09:29.607
Get off!

09:50.895 --> 09:52.496
I mean you no harm.

09:56.268 --> 09:58.002
I am not your enemy!

10:07.212 --> 10:08.512
Who are you?

10:08.513 --> 10:10.047
Helen.

10:10.048 --> 10:11.181
You look beautiful.

10:19.395 --> 10:20.515
Uh.

10:28.043 --> 10:28.876
Who are you?

10:29.912 --> 10:30.745
Wouldn't...

10:32.414 --> 10:33.715
You...

10:36.919 --> 10:38.486
Like to know?

10:57.940 --> 10:59.540
Hello.

10:59.541 --> 11:01.509
You locked me in here.

11:01.510 --> 11:02.744
Jammed my phone.
Trapped me on purpose.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.746
Basically, yes.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.680
To make you
feel good,

11:05.681 --> 11:06.848
having the upper hand?

11:09.818 --> 11:10.885
Stop it!

11:10.886 --> 11:14.555
You mean...
Stop doing this?

11:14.556 --> 11:16.824
No. I've waited
a long time for this.

11:16.825 --> 11:17.959
I want it to last.

11:23.365 --> 11:24.198
Gotcha.

11:24.199 --> 11:25.233
How do you know me?

11:25.234 --> 11:26.167
How indeed.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.054
If you can keep your head

11:46.055 --> 11:48.723
while all about you
are losing theirs.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.664
If you can trust yourself
when all the men doubt you,

11:56.665 --> 11:59.033
if you can wait
and not be tired of waiting.

11:59.034 --> 12:00.835
Please. Listen to me.

12:00.836 --> 12:01.969
...Or being lied about.

12:01.970 --> 12:03.171
What do you want?

12:03.172 --> 12:05.139
Hologram for Dr. Magnus.

12:05.140 --> 12:06.674
Hello, I'm Helen Magnus.

12:06.675 --> 12:07.608
Sign here, please,
would you, ma'am.

12:07.609 --> 12:09.911
Hologram. What hologram?

12:09.912 --> 12:11.612
City hologram.

12:11.613 --> 12:13.214
I don't know what you--

12:14.783 --> 12:15.616
Hologram...

12:15.617 --> 12:17.819
City...

12:17.820 --> 12:19.454
Please. I have no idea.

12:19.455 --> 12:20.855
No, no, no.

12:20.856 --> 12:22.857
Focus.

12:22.858 --> 12:25.626
City. Hologram. Map.

12:25.627 --> 12:28.796
Had any visitors
to the Sanctuary?

12:28.797 --> 12:30.631
Two friends of mine?
Extremely pale?

12:30.632 --> 12:32.967
It was you.
You attacked Will.

12:32.968 --> 12:33.835
You're welcome.

12:35.738 --> 12:38.473
Stop hitting me.

12:48.150 --> 12:50.618
All right.

12:50.619 --> 12:51.519
I know about the city.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.687
Good!

12:52.688 --> 12:53.554
Key stones.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.056
Location. Tell me.

12:56.658 --> 12:57.859
Key stones?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.026
I don't know anything
about any key stones!

12:59.027 --> 12:59.861
I swear!

12:59.862 --> 13:01.996
You have the map, yes?

13:01.997 --> 13:04.132
Had it for weeks now?
Have the map, yes?

13:04.133 --> 13:05.299
Yes.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.001
Studying it.
Learning it, yes?

13:07.002 --> 13:08.870
What we can.
It's very complex.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.572
Have you grown stupid?

13:11.573 --> 13:13.541
Key stones. Location.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.243
Coordinates.

13:15.244 --> 13:17.145
We've been studying the map,
but honestly,

13:17.146 --> 13:18.212
we've found nothing
about any key stones.

13:22.251 --> 13:24.185
Oh, Gregory!

13:24.186 --> 13:27.088
He sends you
this glorious message,

13:27.089 --> 13:28.222
and you don't even
receive it properly.

13:28.223 --> 13:29.690
You know my father?

13:29.691 --> 13:30.992
Did you at least
understand

13:30.993 --> 13:31.993
what you were
looking at?

13:31.994 --> 13:33.928
Hollow earth.

13:33.929 --> 13:35.062
Hollow earth!

13:35.063 --> 13:36.998
Yes, it's
underground!

13:36.999 --> 13:38.599
Bravo!

13:38.600 --> 13:40.001
You want to know
how to get to the city.

13:40.002 --> 13:41.669
By way of the...

13:41.670 --> 13:42.603
Come on, say it.
Say it.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.205
Key stones.

13:44.206 --> 13:46.140
Give the lady
a prize.

13:46.141 --> 13:48.976
I may know something
about them.

13:48.977 --> 13:50.178
You obviously know

13:50.179 --> 13:51.746
more about the city
than I do.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.714
Perhaps you could give me
more details--

13:53.715 --> 13:55.483
Oh, shut up! Just shut up!

13:55.484 --> 13:57.118
Do you think I'm a fool?

14:00.622 --> 14:04.525
Oh, you actually
don't know, do you?

14:04.526 --> 14:05.927
Oh, God,
the woman doesn't know.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.728
You haven't done
your homework.

14:07.729 --> 14:09.730
Very disappointed.

14:09.731 --> 14:12.166
Well, then,
guess we're done.

14:21.543 --> 14:23.177
Ouch.

16:53.395 --> 16:56.297
Here's...

16:56.298 --> 16:57.331
Johnny!

17:02.004 --> 17:04.338
Nice.

18:08.470 --> 18:12.940
First attack here...

18:12.941 --> 18:15.876
Second here...

18:15.877 --> 18:18.879
Third.

18:22.084 --> 18:24.752
He needs an open area
to operate.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.341
Will!

18:47.342 --> 18:49.210
Kate!

18:53.949 --> 18:55.916
What in heaven's name?

18:57.119 --> 18:58.319
Careless...

19:13.869 --> 19:17.204
I see you haven't
lost your touch.

19:17.205 --> 19:20.174
I'm assuming
we've met before.

19:20.175 --> 19:23.477
Can't place you.

19:23.478 --> 19:26.313
Failed cabal
experiment?

19:26.314 --> 19:27.848
Former patient,
perhaps?

19:27.849 --> 19:29.950
Keep guessing.

19:34.956 --> 19:38.459
Come on, Helen.
You're smarter than that.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.427
You've played this game before.

19:42.430 --> 19:45.232
Come on...

19:45.233 --> 19:47.468
Show yourself.

19:47.469 --> 19:50.271
I just want to talk.

20:18.900 --> 20:21.602
Now, tell me
you haven't forgotten me.

20:21.603 --> 20:23.604
Adam.

20:23.605 --> 20:27.241
It's nice to see
you again, love.

20:27.242 --> 20:29.043
It's only been, what?

20:29.044 --> 20:30.077
A hundred years.

20:32.347 --> 20:34.381
This is impossible.

20:34.382 --> 20:35.349
You're dead.

20:37.385 --> 20:38.953
I killed you.

20:43.752 --> 20:45.153
I don't understand.

20:45.154 --> 20:47.789
Yes. It must be
so confusing for you.

20:58.033 --> 20:59.434
Adam--

20:59.435 --> 21:01.569
Don't say you're sorry,
especially if you're not.

21:02.738 --> 21:03.905
How did you--?

21:03.906 --> 21:05.540
Why should I
tell you anything?

21:05.541 --> 21:06.774
What do you really care?

21:17.019 --> 21:20.288
I suppose you're right.
It's a reasonable question.

21:21.924 --> 21:24.892
Have you forgotten
how to talk to me?

21:30.666 --> 21:31.633
Can I talk to Adam?

21:31.634 --> 21:36.170
I'm here. It's me.

21:36.171 --> 21:39.140
Can you forgive me?

21:41.744 --> 21:45.013
What, because I'm
the reasonable one?

21:48.751 --> 21:50.251
Can't do it.

21:52.554 --> 21:53.755
I understand.

21:53.756 --> 21:54.956
Ironically,

21:54.957 --> 21:57.225
he understands
why you killed us.

21:57.226 --> 21:59.594
He said it was
strictly business.

21:59.595 --> 22:02.330
Not to take it
personally.

22:02.331 --> 22:05.166
Yeah, he would
see it that way.

22:05.167 --> 22:06.534
I suppose I need
to talk to him too.

22:06.535 --> 22:10.872
Don't think
you really want to do that.

22:10.873 --> 22:12.807
He's kind of been in charge
of this whole thing

22:12.808 --> 22:13.741
right from the start.

22:13.742 --> 22:17.578
I can see that.

22:17.579 --> 22:18.579
It's all right.

22:18.580 --> 22:25.253
I'll be fine.

22:25.254 --> 22:27.255
It's really good
to see you again.

22:27.256 --> 22:29.023
Hope to see you soon.

22:30.726 --> 22:31.659
Me too.

22:31.660 --> 22:33.594
Devious bitch.

22:36.932 --> 22:38.032
Hello, Adam.

22:38.033 --> 22:39.300
Call me Hyde.

22:39.301 --> 22:40.635
It's not your
real name.

22:40.636 --> 22:41.903
Well, but "Adam Worth"

22:41.904 --> 22:45.206
just seems so
weak and pathetic.

22:45.207 --> 22:46.808
I never really cared
"Jekyll" much.

22:46.809 --> 22:48.776
"Hyde"?

22:48.777 --> 22:50.878
My kind of bastard sobriquet.

22:50.879 --> 22:52.880
Stop glorifying yourself.

22:52.881 --> 22:54.849
It was a book written
in three days

22:54.850 --> 22:55.750
high on cocaine.

22:55.751 --> 22:59.754
About my amazing exploits.

22:59.755 --> 23:01.222
Never saw a penny for it,
mind you.

23:01.223 --> 23:03.725
Stevenson, the selfish bugger.

23:03.726 --> 23:06.327
So is that what all this is?
Revenge?

23:06.328 --> 23:09.297
Since you failed
the holographic map test,

23:09.298 --> 23:10.131
yes, of course it is.

23:13.635 --> 23:14.435
How did you know I had it?

23:21.076 --> 23:24.846
He wanted me to ask you
what you thought of all this.

23:24.847 --> 23:27.782
Always trying to impress you,
the little twerp.

23:27.783 --> 23:28.950
Me?

23:28.951 --> 23:30.885
I could care less.

23:30.886 --> 23:32.653
So, your device.

23:32.654 --> 23:33.654
This is how you travel.

23:33.655 --> 23:35.656
His genius.

23:35.657 --> 23:37.191
My unquenchable thirst
for violence.

23:37.192 --> 23:38.359
Match made in heaven,
really.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.728
Blip! Hello,
smash, crash, bang...

23:40.729 --> 23:42.397
Blip.

23:42.398 --> 23:43.931
Hello.

23:43.932 --> 23:44.799
Best toy I ever had.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.666
For a coward.

23:45.667 --> 23:48.035
Don't you start with me!

23:48.036 --> 23:50.138
I know it's been
a long time, Helen,

23:50.139 --> 23:54.208
but really, honestly,
you murdered us.

23:54.209 --> 23:55.877
You have to admit it,
you've got it coming.

23:58.247 --> 24:00.148
Your toy...

24:00.149 --> 24:02.316
If Adam described how it works,
I'd be even more impressed.

24:02.317 --> 24:05.653
Nice try. Sorry. He's busy.

24:05.654 --> 24:08.389
By the way, he asked me
to make it quick for you.

24:08.390 --> 24:10.725
Naturally, I declined.

24:10.726 --> 24:11.893
I'd rather see you suffer.

24:11.894 --> 24:13.127
How very kind of you.

24:32.047 --> 24:34.382
Helen...

24:36.151 --> 24:40.354
One thing I never really got
was you and Johnny Druitt.

24:43.158 --> 24:46.194
Helen?

24:46.195 --> 24:48.029
What in God's name
did you ever see

24:48.030 --> 24:52.233
in that bullet-headed
misogynist?

24:52.234 --> 24:56.103
I did like Tesla, though.

24:56.104 --> 24:57.772
At least he was honest.

24:57.773 --> 25:00.808
Always knew where you stood
with him.

25:00.809 --> 25:03.778
Watson was the only one
who really gave me a fair shake,

25:03.779 --> 25:06.147
besides you.

25:06.148 --> 25:07.415
You were my favorite.

25:07.416 --> 25:11.052
Until you killed me.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.254
Which, as you may
have guessed,

25:13.255 --> 25:16.023
left me with some
emotional scars.

25:19.895 --> 25:22.029
You could have saved her.

25:22.030 --> 25:24.298
You could have
saved my daughter.

25:24.299 --> 25:27.502
Instead, you left us
with nothing.

25:27.503 --> 25:31.272
I heard about Ashley.

25:31.273 --> 25:35.510
Tragic, isn't it?
Losing a child.

25:43.519 --> 25:44.685
How is this possible?

25:44.686 --> 25:45.520
You haven't aged.

25:48.023 --> 25:50.124
You somehow managed to survive
99 all these years.

25:50.125 --> 25:52.493
You know about the city.

25:52.494 --> 25:53.794
I think we have
a lot to talk about.

25:53.795 --> 25:57.198
You mean you want me
to tell you everything I know

25:57.199 --> 25:59.433
while you give me nothing?

25:59.434 --> 26:00.268
Well...

26:00.269 --> 26:01.536
I've been there.

26:01.537 --> 26:02.937
It's amazing.
You'd love it.

26:02.938 --> 26:04.472
And that's all you get
for now.

26:58.230 --> 26:59.831
How quaint.

26:59.832 --> 27:02.434
A woman with a firearm.

27:03.283 --> 27:04.765
You should have
listened to me.

27:04.975 --> 27:05.975
It needn't have come
to this.

27:05.976 --> 27:09.178
And yet, here we are.

27:10.683 --> 27:12.380
Did you think
they would just ignore you?

27:13.002 --> 27:14.502
Let you spread your chaos
unchecked?

27:15.297 --> 27:17.365
There's something
you need to know, Helen.

27:17.366 --> 27:18.866
About this place.

27:23.549 --> 27:25.250
It's stupendous.

27:25.251 --> 27:26.084
Stop.

27:26.085 --> 27:29.087
I know what you're doing.

27:29.088 --> 27:32.056
More talk until he can
save you with his rage.

27:32.057 --> 27:33.458
Then what are you waiting for?

27:33.459 --> 27:35.126
I know why
you're here.

27:35.127 --> 27:36.761
What your task is.

27:36.762 --> 27:37.729
Go on, finish it.

27:39.598 --> 27:40.598
Finish it!

28:03.083 --> 28:06.185
Are you mad at me, Helen?

28:21.071 --> 28:22.805
Helen?

28:26.343 --> 28:28.511
Helen?

31:04.268 --> 31:06.969
Will! Kate!

31:06.970 --> 31:07.970
Up here!

31:40.657 --> 31:43.326
I know why you're angry.

31:43.327 --> 31:45.328
Good one.

31:46.663 --> 31:48.264
You thought
I was the big threat.

31:48.265 --> 31:49.732
Bastard!

31:49.733 --> 31:52.735
I just wanted to knock
you around a little bit.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.770
See you get
marked up and woozy.

32:00.143 --> 32:01.210
Nice.

32:01.211 --> 32:02.411
You still hit
like a girl, though.

32:02.412 --> 32:04.580
Fancy some more?
Or more parlor tricks?

32:04.581 --> 32:07.850
All of t this,

32:07.851 --> 32:09.785
it's a masterpiece
in your honor.

32:09.786 --> 32:13.589
To show you what you destroyed.

32:13.590 --> 32:14.523
A gifted boy
with a shining mind.

32:14.524 --> 32:15.324
Shut up!

32:15.325 --> 32:16.292
Make me, wench!

32:18.829 --> 32:20.296
Now we're having fun!

32:20.297 --> 32:22.832
Adam? Adam, talk to me.

32:22.833 --> 32:26.168
Sorry, the lad's
not interested.

32:26.169 --> 32:27.036
Let me talk to him!

32:36.980 --> 32:37.880
It was just an idea.

32:37.881 --> 32:40.516
I wasn't sure
that would work.

32:40.517 --> 32:43.686
I learned so much
before they shut us away.

32:45.956 --> 32:46.889
How is this possible?

32:46.890 --> 32:50.192
Time is like paper.

32:50.193 --> 32:52.295
You can fold it up
any way you want.

32:53.864 --> 32:55.631
They can do it.

32:55.632 --> 32:57.566
I just needed
their energy source.

32:57.567 --> 33:00.136
The energy nodules
in the ceiling?

33:00.137 --> 33:01.437
They're doing this?

33:01.438 --> 33:04.307
The constant time
is affected by mass,

33:04.308 --> 33:06.242
altered by changing the effect
of localized gravity...

33:06.243 --> 33:07.743
Adam...

33:11.515 --> 33:13.082
I sped up time.

33:13.083 --> 33:16.419
And that's what allows you
to move around like that?

33:16.420 --> 33:17.787
It changes all the rules.

33:17.788 --> 33:21.424
Faster time allows rifts
to open up in subspace.

33:21.425 --> 33:23.893
Just like doorways.

33:23.894 --> 33:24.827
You like it?

33:26.863 --> 33:27.863
It's brilliant.

33:27.864 --> 33:29.799
I know. It is, isn't it?

33:32.936 --> 33:35.438
Adam, let me go.
We can talk.

33:35.439 --> 33:36.605
No, no. I can't do that.

33:36.606 --> 33:38.240
The whole point of this
is to find a way back.

33:38.241 --> 33:39.508
To the city.

33:39.509 --> 33:41.377
Aye.

33:41.378 --> 33:42.411
And then... well...

33:42.412 --> 33:44.747
Kill me.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.451
Elegantly.

33:52.556 --> 33:54.023
I've so deeply regretted
what I did.

33:54.024 --> 33:54.957
For so long.

33:54.958 --> 33:56.826
Stay back.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.594
I know you
can't forgive me.

33:58.595 --> 34:00.963
And believe me,
I have never forgiven myself.

34:00.964 --> 34:01.931
Not a day goes by...

34:01.932 --> 34:03.332
Stop.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.800
When I don't think
about what I did to you.

34:04.801 --> 34:05.634
Adam...

34:07.671 --> 34:08.637
I miss you.

34:11.574 --> 34:12.408
Me too.

34:13.310 --> 34:15.344
Bloody skank!

34:23.786 --> 34:26.621
You can't enter the rift
exposed.

34:29.493 --> 34:30.659
Not without injury.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.735
Adam!

34:39.735 --> 34:41.904
Adam, talk to me!

34:48.011 --> 34:48.811
Adam!

34:52.014 --> 34:54.817
I was here.

34:54.818 --> 34:55.918
He entered...

34:55.918 --> 34:58.621
Here.

35:02.592 --> 35:05.394
Here...

35:42.732 --> 35:46.769
It's all right.
It's all right.

35:46.770 --> 35:49.104
It's all right.

36:01.852 --> 36:05.454
It's all right.
It's all right.

36:05.455 --> 36:08.390
It's all right.
It's all right.

36:08.391 --> 36:11.026
It's all right.

40:04.583 --> 40:06.371
No more, Adam!

40:08.293 --> 40:10.697
I surrender.
Take me prisoner.

40:10.925 --> 40:12.426
Key stones.
What are they?

40:12.427 --> 40:13.961
How do they lead
to the city?

40:13.962 --> 40:16.697
If you can dream

40:16.698 --> 40:18.765
and let dreams
be your master...

40:18.766 --> 40:20.767
Bleed to death
or talk.

40:20.768 --> 40:22.469
Your choice.

40:22.470 --> 40:23.937
We're divided on that one, see,

40:23.938 --> 40:26.240
because he says
you wouldn't do it.

40:26.241 --> 40:27.107
I'm not so sure.

40:27.108 --> 40:28.141
I killed you once.

40:28.142 --> 40:30.677
This would just be
a loose end.

40:34.782 --> 40:36.717
You've changed
in the last century.

40:43.291 --> 40:45.726
Why did my father
send me the message?

40:45.727 --> 40:46.627
What's so vital
about that city?

40:49.664 --> 40:50.998
Adam! Focus!

40:50.999 --> 40:54.401
Everything is vital
about that place!

40:54.402 --> 40:56.837
You think
miracle earthquakes happen

40:56.838 --> 40:58.539
because you're a nice person?

41:01.409 --> 41:02.309
What was the purpose
of the message?

41:02.310 --> 41:04.444
It was a warning.

41:05.813 --> 41:06.647
About the city?

41:06.648 --> 41:10.584
The city? The city?

41:12.921 --> 41:13.787
It's about me!

41:16.991 --> 41:17.891
Then he's still alive?

41:17.892 --> 41:21.028
It's 50-50 on that one.

41:21.029 --> 41:24.665
He broke some rather large rules
when he sent you that message.

41:24.666 --> 41:26.600
They've executed people
for less.

41:29.537 --> 41:30.470
You have the holomap,

41:30.471 --> 41:33.707
but don't know how to read it.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.943
If you want to save Gregory,
you need me! Me!

41:39.614 --> 41:40.914
Take me to
your Sanctuary,

41:40.915 --> 41:42.950
or leave me here.

41:42.951 --> 41:47.421
Either way...

41:47.422 --> 41:51.458
There'll be
nothing left to study.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.501
Adam, what have you done?

42:03.805 --> 42:06.707
I forgive you, Helen.
I forgive you.

42:06.708 --> 42:07.541
Get up!

42:07.542 --> 42:10.744
Get up!

42:10.745 --> 42:12.846
I forgive you.

42:12.847 --> 42:14.781
Come on!

42:27.795 --> 42:29.529
Come on!

42:38.806 --> 42:40.607
Knock knock.

42:40.608 --> 42:41.541
Are you serious?

42:41.542 --> 42:42.709
Just go with it,
William.

42:42.710 --> 42:44.211
Fine. Who's there?

42:46.814 --> 42:47.748
Magnus!

42:49.117 --> 42:49.916
My God! What happened?

42:49.917 --> 42:51.818
Who's that guy?

42:54.245 --> 42:57.147
Oh, we're in trouble.
