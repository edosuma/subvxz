WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:03.120
It's in the water system.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.640
We need to get them away
from the coast, from the water.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.920
They found the Juno, Charlie.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.240
Everyone was still on board,
when she went down.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.120
I'm coming.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.960
These are the locations
of the other attacks.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.800
This is the migration route.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.720
All the attacks are happening along it.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.880
So, when you called me...
was it just about work?

00:34.640 --> 00:38.120
I know you were all very close,
so if you'd rather not watch...

00:38.600 --> 00:40.280
I want to know, what happened.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
Lili.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.080
-Pick a card.
-I know all your card tricks.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.080
I got a new one.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.880
For you.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.760
C'mon. You're an idiot.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.800
An idiot who likes you.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.760
Very funny.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.320
Ever since we were kids.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.280
You never said...

02:10.760 --> 02:12.600
I'm saying it now.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.080
Me too.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.920
It's just a crab.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.600
They like you.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.200
Mesuli...

03:09.760 --> 03:11.040
Run, Lili! Run!

03:23.920 --> 03:24.920
Come on!

05:41.680 --> 05:43.600
It would've happened fast,

05:44.480 --> 05:46.000
in water that cold.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.840
Whether they were on deck or below.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.600
It doesn't matter how fast it happens.
Nobody drowns quickly.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.680
Your mind panics first,

06:11.640 --> 06:13.920
trying to process what's happening.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.400
Your senses in overdrive.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.280
And then, fear...

06:21.960 --> 06:26.360
You think it can't be happening.
And then you realize it is happening.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.800
You try to fight it, try to stop it,

06:28.960 --> 06:31.280
even though you have no power over it.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.960
Seconds slow down to...

06:40.040 --> 06:41.400
not minutes...

06:43.040 --> 06:45.800
to nothing, time no longer exists...

06:49.080 --> 06:50.360
You pray.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.840
To something...

06:55.000 --> 06:58.120
Anything. And maybe...

06:59.680 --> 07:01.480
Maybe something listens.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.640
But maybe it doesn't.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.520
No matter what, it's not fast.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.680
It's an eternity.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.160
The recovery effort is still underway.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.640
We're hoping to bring them back.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.720
All of them.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.000
But it's not easy.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.240
All I can say right now
is that we are trying

07:51.400 --> 07:54.160
to do everything to make that possible.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.600
Of course.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.640
I know that.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.960
But I want you to know that

08:07.200 --> 08:10.520
your daughter was
one of the brightest students

08:10.680 --> 08:12.680
I had the pleasure of teaching.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.160
Goodbye.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.120
Professor Lehmann?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.600
I'm heading back
to pack up the station for the winter.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.600
I just wanted to say goodbye.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.840
I know how difficult this is for you.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.960
These things mark us.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.040
They stay with us.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.520
Change the way we see the world.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.040
Charlie.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.480
Get out there.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.640
Don't hide.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.840
What helps is other people.
Their support.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.560
Call me when you get there.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.920
I will.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.200
There are no known sources
of bioluminescence

09:59.440 --> 10:02.960
capable of creating a sustained glow
like the one we saw.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.520
We've seen bioluminescent plankton
change the color of entire bays.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.200
At the surface, yes.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.840
But not as deep as that pod dove.

10:12.560 --> 10:16.440
What about that sound?
Ever hear anything like that before?

10:18.240 --> 10:19.240
Nope.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.280
Could it be a distorted whale call?

10:24.520 --> 10:27.840
It has similar structural
characteristics to whale song:

10:28.000 --> 10:29.600
repetitive, rigid.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.360
But I've never
heard one like that before.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.720
What?

10:39.400 --> 10:40.440
Nothing.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.680
Sounds like you have something to say.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.440
Back in the Cold War, the government
was testing all kinds of weapons:

10:50.600 --> 10:53.360
planes, helicopters, flying bombs.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.560
So what do they do
to keep people from finding out?

10:56.800 --> 11:00.280
They leak "confidential" memos
about UFOs in America.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.920
The public becomes obsessed with aliens,

11:03.080 --> 11:07.000
never stopping to think that maybe
their government is doing practice runs

11:07.240 --> 11:08.920
right in front of them.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.320
Prepping war machines
before they fly over

11:11.480 --> 11:14.040
some far part of the world
and wipe them off the map.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.800
The point is,

11:23.960 --> 11:26.560
sometimes
you have to question these things.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.480
Because you better believe
they're expecting you not to.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.400
People died, Jack.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.040
Real people died.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.480
People you know.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.160
And you're sitting here,
telling me what, exactly?

11:44.680 --> 11:46.320
That the military did this?

11:47.640 --> 11:51.800
That the government got whales
to attack tourist boats and tugs?

11:51.960 --> 11:54.080
I'm not telling you anything.

11:54.240 --> 11:58.120
All I'm saying is that sometimes,
something is going on.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.200
The evidence to date suggests

12:11.360 --> 12:15.640
transmission is limited to
contaminated food and drinking water,

12:15.800 --> 12:18.120
possibly person-to-person contact.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.480
-Is it airborne?
-It doesn't seem to be, no.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.360
Does it respond to drugs?

12:24.400 --> 12:27.600
We've tried every drug
known to work against previous strains:

12:27.760 --> 12:31.320
tetracycline, third-generation
cephalosporins, imipenem.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.960
Nothing works.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.200
For the moment, the only
course of action is containment.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.880
You should put out a warning
against drinking, washing,

12:40.040 --> 12:42.160
having any contact whatsoever

12:42.400 --> 12:45.040
with any water
which is not boiled or bottled.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.720
And all fishing off the Atlantic Coast
should also be suspended.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.800
Dr. Granelli, I'm sorry,

12:50.960 --> 12:53.800
but do you understand
what you are asking for?

12:53.960 --> 12:56.360
The disruption to the region
such a measure will cause?

12:56.520 --> 12:58.040
The economic impact?

12:58.200 --> 13:02.160
If this strain of Vibrio vulfinicus
continues to contaminate water systems,

13:02.400 --> 13:04.880
the economic impact
will be far more severe.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.040
Yes, but, Dr. Roche,

13:08.120 --> 13:11.000
you do not know for certain
the situation will worsen.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.680
You are merely speculating
that it could worsen.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.120
-Right?
-But...

13:18.080 --> 13:21.000
In all the years
I've been investigating pathogens,

13:21.160 --> 13:24.160
this is the most deadly ever discovered.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.160
And if we have learned anything
in recent years,

13:27.320 --> 13:30.120
it's that
the consequences of not acting quickly,

13:30.360 --> 13:32.520
decisively, can be fatal.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.760
And I would not want to be the person,
elected or appointed,

13:36.920 --> 13:40.400
who didn't listen to the experts
this time around.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.800
-Hello?
-Isabelle?

14:01.960 --> 14:03.920
-Yes?
-Why didn't you call, sweetie?

14:04.160 --> 14:07.920
I tried 20 times. Not my fault
there's no signal in this dump.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.320
I was worried.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.120
-We're okay. Don't worry.
-How's Louis?

14:15.640 --> 14:19.040
Not happy, because Dad
is making him do schoolwork.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.120
They're arguing, as usual.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.600
Good. Sounds like everything is okay.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.600
Don't tell them I said that.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.840
Don't worry.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.480
When are you coming?

14:35.200 --> 14:39.320
I don't know, hon. All I know is I can't
leave right now. It's impossible.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.720
-Because it's getting worse?
-Yes.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.000
As long as nobody touches the water,

14:47.240 --> 14:48.720
we will get through this.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.240
How long will it go on?

14:51.400 --> 14:54.360
I don't know.
That's what we're trying to figure out.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.440
I love you, Isabelle.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.560
I love you too.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.120
Altimeter is picking up
the seabed, Captain.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.720
You wanna check these over?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.000
Make sure we have the right coordinates?

15:38.560 --> 15:39.960
Yeah, good to go.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.800
Take us down to
six-seven point three-zero north,

15:46.960 --> 15:48.880
eight point six-five east.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.520
And then head downslope,
bearing three-two-two degrees

15:53.120 --> 15:55.880
to six-seven point three-one north,

15:56.040 --> 15:57.920
eight point six-three east.

15:58.680 --> 16:03.320
Approaching target waypoint
at six-seven point three-one north,

16:03.560 --> 16:06.520
eight point six-three east.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.240
What the fuck?

17:02.560 --> 17:05.640
Hovedstad had a ship in this area
the last couple of weeks.

17:06.840 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.720
And now you know why.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.440
You knew?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.360
No, no. But I...

17:39.960 --> 17:41.000
I suspected.

17:41.960 --> 17:42.960
How?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.240
Sato.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.440
Sato?

17:48.280 --> 17:51.040
Mifune knows a shareholder in a company

17:51.280 --> 17:53.280
that manufactures
seabed mining equipment.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.640
Hovedstad ordered its equipment
so they could test it.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.560
Hovedstad's permit is for
exploration of oil and gas hydrates.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.360
-Its permit includes pipe laying.
-For oil and gas.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.200
No, no. You saw what they did!

18:07.560 --> 18:10.600
Everything is torn up.
Everything is dead!

18:11.800 --> 18:15.600
As far as the eye can see.
Does that look like pipe-laying to you?

18:15.840 --> 18:17.400
No, of course not!

18:22.480 --> 18:25.760
-And why didn't you tell me?
-Because I needed to know.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.720
-If I had been lying to you?
-Yeah.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.280
I was afraid that you'd try to stop me
from coming back out here if you had.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.760
You really think
I'd let something like that happen?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.640
That I'd knowingly turn my back
on what we just saw?

18:45.360 --> 18:48.480
-It wouldn't be the first time.
-Oh, how dare you...

18:48.640 --> 18:49.960
What?

18:50.440 --> 18:51.920
What?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.400
Not... not... Not trust you?

18:55.440 --> 18:58.640
Not think you'd drag me
into this charade of a research mission,

18:58.800 --> 19:01.280
only to be taken advantage of, again?

19:01.800 --> 19:04.840
How many times
do you want me to apologize for that?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Once? Twice?

19:07.160 --> 19:08.360
A hundred times?

19:08.600 --> 19:11.240
-God knows it's been more.
-So I should just...

19:11.400 --> 19:13.280
Well, I should just let it go then, huh?

19:13.440 --> 19:15.440
Pretend that it never happened?

19:16.440 --> 19:18.720
We were different people back then.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.400
-I don't know, I guess I thought we'd...
-Forget?

19:22.560 --> 19:24.120
Moved on!

19:24.360 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, well, so did I.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.880
Yeah.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.000
For what it's worth,
I don't think Tina knew.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.360
How could she not?

19:49.520 --> 19:53.320
The permit includes installation
technology for preparing the seabed.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.240
For burying pipelines for oil and gas,

19:56.400 --> 19:59.720
which is done
with the same trenching tools they use

19:59.880 --> 20:02.960
to mine the sediment
on the continental slopes.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.320
I read the permits, Sigur.

20:05.480 --> 20:09.400
Unless you were looking for it,
it would have been easy to miss.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.400
And if you go public with the story,

20:13.640 --> 20:17.600
they'll find some way to claim the
permits cover the mining tests as well.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.040
And if they can't,
they'll find someone to blame,

20:20.200 --> 20:23.360
someone Hovedstad decides is expendable.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.920
-It could very well be Tina.
-Tina?

20:27.160 --> 20:28.920
She recommended you.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.480
She convinced Hovedstad to bring you in.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.400
If they want to throw someone
to the wolves, who better?

20:37.600 --> 20:38.800
Alright.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.760
So what do I do?

20:45.160 --> 20:48.680
I don't know how many times
I've asked that same question.

20:48.840 --> 20:52.320
All the different reasons I came up with

20:52.480 --> 20:55.480
not to do something
when I saw something wrong.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.440
Rahim and the other young ones
are right.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.840
We didn't do enough.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.280
We wrote papers and reports
for all the right causes,

21:06.440 --> 21:07.600
and then?

21:08.520 --> 21:10.120
We walked away.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.360
And we left the real work,

21:14.840 --> 21:17.720
the hard work, to others.

21:20.840 --> 21:21.840
Yeah.

21:23.920 --> 21:27.160
But before you decide anything,
you should talk to Tina.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.760
I'll try.

21:29.920 --> 21:33.320
-But after what I said...
-Apologize.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.720
Apologize?

21:36.320 --> 21:39.480
Yeah. Sounds so easy when you say it.

21:41.920 --> 21:45.920
The harder it is,
the more likely she is to accept it.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.880
After first coming ashore
in South Africa,

21:53.040 --> 21:55.560
the crabs have made landfall
in Rio de Janeiro,

21:55.720 --> 21:58.680
Okinawa, Mumbai and Tangier.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.920
Invasions of crabs
have become increasingly common

22:02.080 --> 22:04.120
due to rising sea temperatures.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.840
But attacks of this scale
are unprecedented.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.280
Turns out we weren't the only ones
who came across the new mussel.

22:22.120 --> 22:26.120
The mussel on the right was found in
Madagascar, at the harbor in Toamasina.

22:26.280 --> 22:29.840
The one next to it
in Asunción, Paraguay.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.040
And this one in Lake Victoria, Uganda.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.680
The lab sequenced the DNA of all four.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.240
They have the same
genetic barcode sequence.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.680
What are the chances
of finding a new species

22:42.840 --> 22:45.360
in so many different places
at the same time?

22:46.480 --> 22:48.680
I can't think of a single instance.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.840
There's something else...

22:51.000 --> 22:52.440
I ran a test on the clot

22:52.600 --> 22:54.720
found in the brainstem of the whale.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.880
And compared it to the white substance

22:57.040 --> 22:59.600
leaking from
the mussel from the Barrier Queen.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.520
I found a handful of organic compounds
common to both.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.280
Some of which are pollutants.

23:04.440 --> 23:07.040
But they appear in
lots of marine species.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.560
In whales.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.040
And in other mammals.
But not in mussels.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.000
Not in mussels, no.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.280
The sample from the Barrier Queen
is very fragile.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.240
It decomposes as soon as
it's exposed to air.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.880
But if you can get me another sample,

23:23.040 --> 23:24.920
I can run a few more tests.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.560
Name and ID, please.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.640
Leon Anawak,
Vancouver Island Marine Institute.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.720
I'm here to see Clive Roberts.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.240
I'm sorry, sir,
this is now a restricted area.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.880
-Please back your car up, sir.
-But I met him the other day.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.880
Back the vehicle up.
This area is off limits.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.680
I won't tell you again.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.360
Oh, shit.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.200
Hey! Hey, you!

25:37.440 --> 25:40.040
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

25:41.560 --> 25:42.560
Hey!

25:48.720 --> 25:49.720
Freeze!

25:54.640 --> 25:56.280
Answer us!

26:11.960 --> 26:13.160
Okay.

26:14.920 --> 26:15.960
Don't shoot.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.240
On your knees.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.080
Hands behind your head.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.440
Is that really necessary?

27:09.320 --> 27:11.280
You want something to drink?

27:11.440 --> 27:13.080
-Coffee?
-Please.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.280
Could we get a couple of coffees?

27:24.640 --> 27:26.680
Want to tell me what's going on?

27:28.400 --> 27:32.280
-Am I under arrest?
-Not if someone doesn't press charges.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.160
I called you about
getting another sample.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.560
-I couldn't get through.
-That's no reason to jump the fence.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.760
There's someone
who wants to talk to you.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.400
We're getting them on the line now.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.040
Just tell the truth.

27:53.080 --> 27:57.280
You're in enough trouble already.
You don't want to be lying to anyone.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.960
Okay.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.680
Just to be clear:

28:04.840 --> 28:07.400
you returned to
the Port of Vancouver because...?

28:07.560 --> 28:09.600
Because I needed
another sample of the mussels,

28:09.760 --> 28:11.880
which I picked up
the first time I was here.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.760
When we examined it,
we discovered several features

28:14.920 --> 28:17.320
not seen in other species of mollusks.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.880
We also found a substance
we hadn't seen before.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.040
We were unable to run
a full battery of tests

28:22.200 --> 28:24.080
because it deteriorated so quickly.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.760
But...

28:27.400 --> 28:29.160
But we're pretty sure
it's a new species.

28:30.560 --> 28:34.120
A new species unique to Japan?
Or Vancouver?

28:34.880 --> 28:38.120
We believe the Barrier Queen
picked up the mussels in Tokyo.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.800
We haven't found them in these waters.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.080
But they've been found elsewhere.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.560
And not just in the Pacific.

28:50.320 --> 28:55.480
I'm sure you can understand our desire
to contain this threat to shipping.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
I do.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.840
So if you could send me the information
about the other locations

29:01.000 --> 29:02.960
where the mussels have been found...

29:03.120 --> 29:04.120
I will.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.080
And any new locations you might hear of.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.160
As well as any other information
you think we should know.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.040
Sure.

29:16.480 --> 29:20.720
Mr. Sato, I promise you
I didn't come here to cause trouble.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.560
You made that very clear, Mr. Anawak.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.800
And on my part,

29:25.040 --> 29:29.000
I'm sorry that you felt
you needed to do something so rash

29:29.160 --> 29:31.000
to get the sample you needed.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.640
In the future, we'll make sure
you get everything you need.

29:41.680 --> 29:45.520
-What do you think?
-He's holding back.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.440
-He's afraid.
-Clearly.

29:48.680 --> 29:52.200
But he could also be hiding something.

29:53.400 --> 29:57.920
A new species of ice worms,
mutated mussels,

29:58.080 --> 30:02.480
both of which present
a clear threat to shipping.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.680
It can't be a coincidence.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.880
Heard you had a rough night.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.040
Yeah.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.320
Wanna talk about it?

31:13.480 --> 31:15.960
-I screwed up.
-It happens.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.160
They pulled a gun on me.

31:18.400 --> 31:22.160
-You broke into a secure facility.
-Just to get a handful of mussels.

31:22.760 --> 31:25.600
Leon, think about it.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.760
What do you think they saw?

31:28.920 --> 31:30.960
A PhD candidate from VI?

31:31.120 --> 31:34.200
Or some First Nations kid
looking for something to steal?

31:34.800 --> 31:36.760
You've got to be more careful.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.800
I should've told Dr. Oliviera
to send someone else.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.000
-Why?
-What do you mean, "why?"

31:45.160 --> 31:47.920
-You just told me why.
-I told you to be more careful.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.000
That comes as news to you?

31:51.200 --> 31:52.200
No...

31:55.480 --> 31:57.680
But it's different
when it happens to you.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.120
First time a cop pulled a gun on me,

32:10.040 --> 32:13.480
I threw up, all over his shoes.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.640
The guy was so disgusted, he let me go.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.240
I couldn't get away quick enough.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.080
You feel safe here, I get it.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.080
We all do... around our own.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.360
But what you're gonna
have to figure out is:

32:35.520 --> 32:37.880
Who's going to decide
how you live your life?

32:39.040 --> 32:43.080
You?
Or the people who wanna keep you small?

33:22.600 --> 33:24.520
Hey, Rahim, it's Dad.

33:25.520 --> 33:29.280
Your mum tried to call you
about your sister's birthday.

33:30.720 --> 33:34.760
We would love to see you and Max there.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.000
Take care.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.840
Oh God.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.840
See you soon.

34:20.760 --> 34:21.840
Thank you.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.400
Take care, now.

35:11.560 --> 35:12.960
Hello?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.760
Hey. I was just passing,
saw you were back.

35:17.920 --> 35:19.400
Thought I'd say hi.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.520
Come in.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
Okay.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.400
I think I have some tea.

35:45.960 --> 35:48.280
Maybe milk, if it hasn't gone off.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.760
Sounds lovely.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.760
Whoa. Maybe not.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.160
I'll take mine black.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.200
Good choice.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.680
So how long are you back for?

36:12.160 --> 36:14.560
-Depends.
-On what?

36:15.200 --> 36:18.480
How long it takes me
to pack up the station for the winter.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.720
Well, I'd offer to give you a hand,

36:28.880 --> 36:31.200
but not if it makes the work
go any faster.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.680
Then I won't ask.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.600
Good.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.880
How's that tea doing?

36:47.000 --> 36:48.480
What's up with you?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.120
Hey.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.440
You're through to Tina Lund.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.880
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.760
Tina, it's me.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.280
Call me, please. It's important.

38:03.920 --> 38:04.920
What's up?

38:05.080 --> 38:07.320
I've been thinking
about the sound we heard.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.280
And I'm wondering
if anyone else picked up on it.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.840
In the Pacific
or anywhere else in the world.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.160
We could check
the Sound Surveillance System.

38:15.400 --> 38:18.120
I'll try reaching out
to the World Oceanographic Commission.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.560
Maybe they can put us in touch

38:19.800 --> 38:22.400
with other organizations
which monitor oceanic sounds.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.840
-What do you think?
-I think it's a good idea.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.200
And... it's got me thinking.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.560
This is going
to sound like a stretch, but...

38:33.800 --> 38:36.760
I met someone who I think
you should try and contact.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.200
Her name is Dr. Samantha Crowe.
Astrophysicist.

38:42.280 --> 38:46.280
She might be able to offer
some less conventional thoughts.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.640
I'll see if I can track her down.

39:37.040 --> 39:40.080
-What time is it?
-Just gone five.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.000
The mackerel are running,
I've got to catch the high tide.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.640
I'll bring you some.

39:48.480 --> 39:49.800
No, you won't.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.240
Go.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.960
There's coffee.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.600
Hi, Charlie. It's me.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.000
Just checking to see
you got back safely.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.600
No news from this side.

40:38.760 --> 40:42.240
I'll be working late again,
so you're not going to bother me.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.360
So give me a call. Bye.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.600
Charlie.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.320
Thanks for the message.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.440
Thirty.

40:52.440 --> 40:53.840
How did that happen?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.760
Wish you were here to soften the blow.

40:57.440 --> 41:00.600
We could relive
some of last year's madness.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.240
Maybe not. Considering.

41:07.320 --> 41:11.160
Anyway, hope the reason
you're not answering

41:11.320 --> 41:14.520
is because you're
with that hot guy from the boat.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.520
Miss you.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.440
Charlie. Thanks for the message.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.800
Thirty.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.600
How did that happen?

41:40.760 --> 41:43.520
Wish you were here to soften the blow.

41:43.680 --> 41:47.240
We could relive
some of last year's madness.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.440
Maybe not. Considering.

41:53.520 --> 41:57.440
Anyway, hope the reason
you're not answering

41:57.600 --> 42:00.800
is because you're
with that hot guy from the boat.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.120
Miss you.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.560
Miss you.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.000
Miss you.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.000
Miss you.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.360
Miss you.

43:04.680 --> 43:06.080
Miss you.
