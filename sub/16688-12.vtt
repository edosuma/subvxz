00:40.920 --> 00:43.540
<i>Fist Pump has left</i>

00:43.640 --> 00:45.660

Man, I never thought I'd be so
excited for a Fist Pump show.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.540
I must really be missing
Earth junk.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.460
Well, also, last time
we worked all day

01:11.560 --> 01:13.340
to afford tickets
and ended up sleeping

01:13.440 --> 01:16.560
through the entire show.
( Cheering )

01:15.880 --> 01:17.880
The universe is giving us
a second chance ââ

01:17.760 --> 01:19.580
for redemption.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.220
Hmmâhmmâhmm.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.320
This time, we got our tickets
two weeks in advance.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.220
Two tickets for ââ hey!

01:25.320 --> 01:26.980
We took a long space nap.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.260
( Hissing )

01:28.360 --> 01:30.360
We both downloaded
this sweet lighter app

01:30.080 --> 01:31.740
for slow power ballads.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.840
And we still have two hours
to get to the show early.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.620
Let's do this.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.700
Both: Fist Pump!

( Both cheer )

01:38.760 --> 01:40.300
Aww, what?

01:40.400 --> 01:42.400
How come the tubes get you
to the Top of the Space Tree

01:42.480 --> 01:44.580
in five seconds,
but the line takes two hours?

01:44.680 --> 01:47.140
Don't worry, dude.
I planned for this.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.900
I know a secret elevator.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.740
It'll take two hours to get
to the top of the Space Tree,

01:51.840 --> 01:53.580
but there's no line.
( Clicks teeth )

01:53.680 --> 01:55.700
Dude, nice work.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.820
Follow me, dude.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.900
Whoa!
A Lift Master!

02:00.000 --> 02:02.260
Classic.
Yeeah!

02:02.360 --> 02:05.220
The 4,000 series is one of my
favorite LiftâMaster Models.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.340
Oh, it's on my top five
for sure.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.860
Both:
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:10.960 --> 02:13.860
( Both chanting "Fist Pump" )

02:13.960 --> 02:15.580
No way!

02:15.680 --> 02:17.680
Their best music video was
where they drove that truck

02:17.600 --> 02:19.600
With the big fist on the front
into that high school.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.860
And the they're all like

02:21.960 --> 02:23.540
( Chuckles ) Yeah, yeah.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.640
And then all the teachers get
turned into swimsuit models.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.660

02:26.760 --> 02:28.760
So stupid.

Here's the best part!

02:43.840 --> 02:45.940
( Both yell )

02:46.040 --> 02:48.220
( Both groan )

02:48.320 --> 02:50.180
Rigby, what the heck
did you do?

02:50.280 --> 02:52.280
Don't worry, I just hit
the "stop" button.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.300
No big deal.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.580
All I gotta do is press
the button for the top floor.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.020
Dude, we're not moving.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.180
( Chuckles nervously )

02:58.280 --> 02:59.820
Just press the button.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.020

03:01.120 --> 03:03.120
Try hitting
the stop button again.

Come on! Come on!

03:07.120 --> 03:09.120
We're gonna be late
for Fist Pump!

03:08.560 --> 03:10.460
Dude, you gotta
press it harder! Hwah!

03:10.560 --> 03:12.560
Rigby,
you're gonna break it.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.300
Look, we'll try
the call box.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.400
Maybe they need to reset
the system or something.

Hello?
Hello?

03:21.560 --> 03:22.740
Dude, no one's answering.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.220
Okay, okay, don't panic.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.020
What did we do when we were
stuck in that meat locker?

03:27.120 --> 03:28.500
âHelp!
âHelp!

03:28.600 --> 03:29.700
Get us out of here!

03:29.800 --> 03:31.800
The emergency phone's
not working!

03:31.080 --> 03:32.980
Wait a sec.
We've got our own phones.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.220
Oh, yeah!

03:34.320 --> 03:36.320
( Cellphone beeps )
Oh, man.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.360
I don't have
any reception.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.380
Hmm, I think I'm getting

03:37.480 --> 03:39.480
a little something
over here.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.940
Gimme a boost.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.020
â( Grunts )
âAlmost got it.

Ha! One bar!

03:45.600 --> 03:46.980
( Cellphone buzzes )
Oh, sweet.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.080
There's an update
for the lighter app!

03:48.400 --> 03:50.500
Now they also have a blow torch,
a glow stick,

03:50.600 --> 03:52.700
and ââ Whoa!
A tiki torch!

03:52.800 --> 03:55.100
See, Mordecai?
See? See? See the tiki torch?

03:55.200 --> 03:57.780
âRigby, just call for help.
âChill, man.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.460
This'll just take a second.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.620
Gotta have my sweet lighter
for Fist Pump!

04:01.720 --> 04:03.220
( Cellphone buzzes )
Hmm.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.060
âWhat is it?
âMy battery just died.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.140
âWhat?!
âOof!

04:06.240 --> 04:07.460
Rigby, you idiot!

04:07.560 --> 04:09.560
Why'd you have to break
the elevator?

04:09.200 --> 04:11.200
We were <i>thisclose</i>
to seeing Fist Pump.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.940
Instead, we're stuck here
in this tiny little box.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.260
And it'll probably
be hours

04:14.360 --> 04:15.940
before anyone notices
we're gone.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.860
Plus, who knows how long
it'll take 'em

04:17.960 --> 04:18.900
to get us out of here?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.300
It's just a good thing

04:20.400 --> 04:23.420
your claustrophobia's
not acting up.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.660
I gotta get out of here.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.220
I gotta get out of here!

04:27.320 --> 04:29.340
Dude, will you relax?

04:29.440 --> 04:30.900

04:31.000 --> 04:32.420
Three, four, five!

04:32.520 --> 04:35.860
That's the last time you throw
a dance party, maggots!

04:35.960 --> 04:36.860
( Breathing heavily )

04:36.960 --> 04:38.060
( Beeping )

04:38.160 --> 04:39.660
No one's answering.
We're trapped.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.460
It's cool, man.
We're gonna be okay.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.580
You don't know that!

04:42.680 --> 04:46.220
( Panting )
I can't breathe!

04:46.320 --> 04:48.140
This shirt's too tight!

04:48.240 --> 04:51.060
( Breathing frantically )

04:51.160 --> 04:52.260
( Moans )

04:52.360 --> 04:53.500
( Crying )

04:53.600 --> 04:54.980
Rigby.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.080
The only thing left to do
is to pose our bodies

04:56.840 --> 04:58.840
so we leave behind
coolâlooking skeletons.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.300
We're not gonna die
in here.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.540
Lemme get that.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.820
We had a good run, man.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.700
We're gonna get out
of here, okay?

05:04.800 --> 05:06.800
So just focus on thinking
about good things.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.780
Like hot wings,

05:07.880 --> 05:10.620
Strong Johns, Cheezers.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.580
Cheezers.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.060
I wish they had a Cheezers
on the Space Tree.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.460
Yeah. But we've got most of the
stuff we had back on earth.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.380
So it's still pretty cool.
Yeah.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.480
But what are we gonna do
when we leave the Space Tree

05:21.280 --> 05:22.300
to go on our mission?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.540
I don't know.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.900
What <i>arewe gonna do?</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Who knows what it's gonna
be like out there?

05:27.880 --> 05:29.420
It might totally suck.
Yeah.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.960
And good luck getting Rawls
to tell you anything about it.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.420
And, dude,
we don't even know

05:33.520 --> 05:35.520
when we're going back
to Earth

05:34.880 --> 05:36.260
or <i>ifwe're going back.</i>

05:36.360 --> 05:37.580
Mordecai?

05:37.680 --> 05:39.900
Y'know, even if we get out
of this elevator,

05:40.000 --> 05:41.980
we're still trapped inside
a big metal box,

05:42.080 --> 05:45.200
floating through space.
Any illusions we once had

05:44.520 --> 05:46.620
of being masters of our fate
have been forfeited

05:46.720 --> 05:48.820
to a man who'd rather preoccupy
us with pushâups

05:48.920 --> 05:50.620
than prepare us
for whatever horrors

05:50.720 --> 05:52.820
await us out there in the cold,
infinite abyss.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.860
Dude, Mordecai,
it's cool, man.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.780
No, Rigby, it's not.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.420
You know, Fist Pump's
a dumb band,

05:58.520 --> 06:00.420
but we may have just missed
our last chance

06:00.520 --> 06:02.140
to ever see another
rock concert.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.820
I miss Earth.

06:04.920 --> 06:09.620
All alone
in the world tonight

06:09.720 --> 06:10.980
( Moans )

06:11.080 --> 06:15.420
Got nothing left
to even put up a fight

06:15.520 --> 06:17.700
( Grunting ) No!

06:17.800 --> 06:20.300
We're not missing
Fist Pump again!

06:20.400 --> 06:22.400
This might be
our last chance

06:21.720 --> 06:23.720
to enjoy one of our favorite
things from Earth.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.580
Get up!

06:24.680 --> 06:26.020
Dude,
it wasn't meant to be.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.120
Let's just wait here
till someone saves us

06:27.080 --> 06:28.500
or till we starve to death.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.340
( Cellphone beeps )
I don't care ââ whatever.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.700
Get...up.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.260
Dude, I ââ Ow!

06:33.360 --> 06:35.180
Oof! Okay! Okay!
Quit it!

06:35.280 --> 06:36.180
Sheesh.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.860
Now I'm standing.
Happy?

06:37.960 --> 06:39.460
Hold still.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.980
Uhhh, ah!
Oof! Hey!

06:41.080 --> 06:43.080
( Grunting )

06:45.840 --> 06:47.660
I can see our floor!
Get up here!

06:47.760 --> 06:49.260
We're climbing.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.900
( Groans ) Fine.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.500
( Grunting )

06:53.600 --> 06:57.240
Must...see...Fist Pump!

06:58.840 --> 07:00.500
This is the floor!

07:00.600 --> 07:01.540
Come on, man!

07:01.640 --> 07:02.860
Eh.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.260
( Growls ) Hello?

07:05.360 --> 07:06.460
Anybody out there?!

07:06.560 --> 07:07.540
Help!

07:07.640 --> 07:08.660
Whoo!

07:08.760 --> 07:10.260
Fist Pump!

07:10.360 --> 07:11.420
Anyone?!

07:11.520 --> 07:13.520
Dude, nobody can hear us!

07:14.200 --> 07:15.860
Eh, useless.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.780
Uhhh, there's an open vent
up here!

07:18.880 --> 07:21.000
Follow me!
( Grunts )

07:22.280 --> 07:23.860
Dude, come on!

07:23.960 --> 07:25.900
Fine.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
( Grunts )

07:31.920 --> 07:35.300
( Grunting )

07:35.400 --> 07:36.940
Where do you think
this thing goes?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.060
I don't know, but it doesn't
feel very staââ

07:39.160 --> 07:40.380
( Both yell )

07:40.480 --> 07:41.660
( Groans )

07:41.760 --> 07:42.860
( Moans )

07:42.960 --> 07:45.260
Uh, are we still
in the Space Tree?

07:45.360 --> 07:47.220
We can't be too far
from the observatory.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.660
Let's keep moving.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.380
( Bats screeching )

07:51.480 --> 07:52.620
What was that?

07:52.720 --> 07:54.720
I don't know, dude.
I can't see a thing!

07:54.000 --> 07:55.420
Something's in here
with us.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.520
Dude, get out
that lighter app.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.260
( Gasps )

08:01.360 --> 08:03.480
( Both scream )

08:05.480 --> 08:06.980
( Bats screeching )

08:07.080 --> 08:10.180
Creature: ( Deep voice )
You dare wake my children?

08:10.280 --> 08:11.820
( Gasps )

08:11.920 --> 08:18.220
You dare disturb
their peaceful sleep?!

08:18.320 --> 08:20.660
You must be punished.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.260
I will throw you both
into Bottomless Pit

08:24.360 --> 08:27.060
of Eternal Darkness!

08:27.160 --> 08:28.180
( Whimpers )

08:28.280 --> 08:29.660
Ha ha.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.940
Pretty scary, right?

08:32.040 --> 08:35.460
Well, I mean, yeah.
I guess it is. Sure.

08:35.560 --> 08:37.460
Come on, man!
It's terrifying!

08:37.560 --> 08:39.220
I put a lot of work into it.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.540
Well, it's just that it...

08:40.640 --> 08:42.220
...doesn't look
that bottomless?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.320
Yeah, yeah, exactly
what I was gonna say.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.640
You know, wait. I think I can
actually see the bottom.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.980
Silence!

08:47.080 --> 08:48.260
All right, all right.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.360
We were just
trying to go see

08:49.560 --> 08:51.560
our favorite band
from Earth play.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.120
It might be our last chance ever
to see Fist Pump.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.940
I don't care what you ââ
Wait. What?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.940
Did you say Fist Pump?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.460
( Growls )

08:58.560 --> 09:01.420
I haven't heard that name
since I left Earth.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.900
Yeah, dude.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
They're playing at the top
of the Space Tree tonight.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.600
I stowed away
under their bus

09:05.800 --> 09:08.180
for their entire
"Fresh Outta Prison" tour

09:08.280 --> 09:09.380
three years ago.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.060
Those were good times.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.580
But then I met my wife,

09:12.680 --> 09:14.300
had a couple hundred
children,

09:14.400 --> 09:16.260
and then she wanted to
move out to space

09:16.360 --> 09:18.060
to be closer to her family.

09:18.160 --> 09:21.100
So here I am, five minutes
from the inâlaws

09:21.200 --> 09:23.900
and a million miles away
from the nearest rock concert.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.860
And all I have to show for it

09:25.960 --> 09:28.700
is a pit that isn't even
that bottomless.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.740
( Sighs )
Sometimes I really miss Earth.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.940
( Gasps ) Do they still
have pizza there?
Yeah.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.060
Do they still not let giant bats
into pizza parlors?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.260
Yeah.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.220
Dude, Fist Pump is playing
right now!

09:41.320 --> 09:44.500
Well, my wife's gonna be
at her book club

09:44.600 --> 09:46.600
for another couple hours.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.460
Whaddya say we sneak off
to a concert? Huh?

09:48.560 --> 09:49.780
Cool!
Cool!

09:49.880 --> 09:51.820
Come on, sing
with all your might

09:51.920 --> 09:54.700
Let it out,
it's Saturday night

09:54.800 --> 09:57.100
Lazers 4 lyfe

09:57.200 --> 09:58.420
Dude, watch out!

09:58.520 --> 10:00.540
Yeah,

10:00.640 --> 10:02.980
I don't know if this is
gonna work!

10:03.080 --> 10:04.900
Aaaagh!
Aaaagh!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.620
Lasers 4 Lyfe

10:06.720 --> 10:08.420
Both: Awwâyeahâuh!

10:08.520 --> 10:09.700
Lasers 4 Lyfe

10:09.800 --> 10:11.020
Hey, hey, hey, hey

10:11.120 --> 10:13.260
The music's loud
for hanging out

10:13.360 --> 10:15.340
( Chanting "Fist Pump" )

10:15.440 --> 10:17.220
( Zing! )
Aaagh!

10:17.320 --> 10:19.020
My eyes!

10:19.120 --> 10:20.220
( Cheering )

10:20.320 --> 10:21.580
( Rigby screams )

10:21.680 --> 10:23.020
( Cheering continues )

10:23.120 --> 10:25.980
( Laughs ) Just kidding.
I'm already blind.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.700
( Laughs )
Doesn't even hurt.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.100
Dude, space
<i>ispretty cool.</i>

10:31.200 --> 10:32.460
Yeah, it is.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.500
Fist Pump!
