WEBVTT

00:01.036 --> 00:03.094
Tonight, on
"Kitchen Nightmares"--

00:03.094 --> 00:05.144
Gordon heads for an
Italian restaurant

00:05.144 --> 00:06.324
that's headed for disaster.

00:06.324 --> 00:08.274
Why did you decide to
become a chef/owner,

00:08.274 --> 00:10.224
if you haven't got a clue
how to run a business?

00:10.224 --> 00:13.114
But you couldn't tell
that by watching the staff.

00:14.054 --> 00:14.393
Give me a break.

00:14.393 --> 00:16.254
Is
Campania a business--

00:16.254 --> 00:17.274
Good afternoon, Campania.

00:17.274 --> 00:19.124
--or a high
school cooking class?

00:20.054 --> 00:22.144
It's like a big
romper room back there.

00:22.144 --> 00:24.214
The owner is
the big man on campus.

00:24.214 --> 00:25.244
People love my food.

00:25.244 --> 00:26.294
You're seriously in denial.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.074
And the employees--

00:28.074 --> 00:28.413
You.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.000
--seem to
be here for the party.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.204
--seem to
be here for the party.

00:30.204 --> 00:31.194
Campania's like high school.

00:31.194 --> 00:32.324
Because everybody,
like, really gets along.

00:32.324 --> 00:34.324
I feel like I'm in the middle
of a rehearsal for "Friends."

00:34.324 --> 00:36.244
Ev, you're so sexy when
you're making chicken.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.164
It takes
forever for the food

00:38.164 --> 00:39.184
to get out of the kitchen.

00:39.184 --> 00:40.194
I need your specials now.

00:40.194 --> 00:41.184
That  never went out?

00:41.184 --> 00:43.034
On top of
that, there's not only

00:43.034 --> 00:43.413
fighting in the restaurant--

00:43.413 --> 00:44.284
I want to go strangle him.

00:44.284 --> 00:46.234
--there's
fighting in the parking lot.

00:46.234 --> 00:48.274
Why did you keep eating,
if it was that bad?

00:48.274 --> 00:50.284
And because
the enormous portions

00:50.284 --> 00:53.074
are insuring no one leaves
without a party favor--

00:53.074 --> 00:54.144
Even the dog's got
a serving there.

00:54.144 --> 00:55.174
There's the bone
for him as well.

00:55.174 --> 00:57.094
--the food
costs are out of control.

00:57.094 --> 00:58.134
- I
- could go in there

00:58.134 --> 01:00.000
and just give you $500 of waste.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.124
and just give you $500 of waste.

01:00.124 --> 01:02.324
But now,
the party's over.

01:02.324 --> 01:04.154
You have to cut
these portions down.

01:04.154 --> 01:07.114
If Gordon can't
get this cast of "Friends"

01:07.114 --> 01:08.304
to grow up--
Take it serious.

01:08.304 --> 01:09.084
I will.

01:09.084 --> 01:10.124
Run
it like a boss.

01:10.124 --> 01:12.264
--this restaurant's
going to be grounded for life.

01:12.264 --> 01:14.154
I felt like I was eating Ragu.

01:14.154 --> 01:16.214
Tonight, on
"Kitchen Nightmares."

01:16.214 --> 01:17.204
This is not party time.

01:17.204 --> 01:18.144
This is serious time.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.124
We're doing it.

01:19.124 --> 01:20.064
OK.

01:41.044 --> 01:43.054
Fair
Lawn, New Jersey--

01:43.054 --> 01:45.104
a predominantly
Italian community

01:45.104 --> 01:48.094
about 20 minutes
from New York City.

01:48.094 --> 01:51.094
For years, Campania was
a successful business.

01:51.094 --> 01:54.324
But since Joe Cerniglia took
ownership 18 months ago,

01:54.324 --> 01:57.084
the business has
dramatically declined.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.274
And it's only a few
months away from closing.

01:59.274 --> 02:00.000
Good afternoon, Campania.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.254
Good afternoon, Campania.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.284
I didn't go to culinary school.

02:02.284 --> 02:03.314
What's this chicken for?

02:03.314 --> 02:04.314
We don't have recipes.

02:04.314 --> 02:06.214
We don't use measuring
cups or spoons.

02:06.214 --> 02:09.124
Because I'm the best.

02:09.124 --> 02:10.254
We're waiting on the pecans.

02:10.254 --> 02:11.254
There's no pecans.

02:11.254 --> 02:12.194
Huh?

02:12.194 --> 02:13.154
There's no pecans.

02:13.154 --> 02:14.124
It said, pine nuts.

02:14.124 --> 02:15.304
Ooh!

02:15.304 --> 02:17.204
We have a lot of fun here.

02:18.294 --> 02:20.154
Sometimes, I guess, a bad thing.

02:20.154 --> 02:22.294
Because we don't take everything
too seriously sometimes.

02:22.294 --> 02:23.304
Nut job?

02:23.304 --> 02:26.274
, I'm not a nut job.

02:26.274 --> 02:30.000
The kitchen's always playing
practical jokes on each other.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.114
The kitchen's always playing
practical jokes on each other.

02:30.114 --> 02:32.174
What-- will you stop
locking him in the walk-in?

02:34.214 --> 02:36.184
Sorry, Moe.

02:36.184 --> 02:38.304
It's like, a big
romper room back there.

02:38.304 --> 02:40.144
Give me a break.

02:40.144 --> 02:41.164
We're all, like, little kids.

02:41.164 --> 02:42.164
We're all very silly.

02:42.164 --> 02:44.134
Yo, what up, yo?

02:44.134 --> 02:45.084
I'm still a kid.

02:45.084 --> 02:46.144
I still have a tongue ring.

02:46.144 --> 02:47.104
I still have a tattoo.

02:47.104 --> 02:49.114
And I don't really
plan on changing

02:49.114 --> 02:50.164
the way I think anytime soon.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.144
I am serious.

02:52.144 --> 02:54.264
But I'm going to have fun
with it while I'm, you know,

02:54.264 --> 02:55.224
in the process.

02:55.224 --> 02:57.134
Get to work.

02:57.134 --> 02:59.104
Campania definitely
has it's share

02:59.104 --> 03:00.000
of problems, big problems.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.214
of problems, big problems.

03:02.214 --> 03:04.224
Our oven is broken.

03:04.224 --> 03:05.294
Completely broken.

03:05.294 --> 03:07.274
These are not working ovens.

03:07.274 --> 03:10.214
So they've now become
storage for us.

03:10.214 --> 03:11.194
We have two walk-ins.

03:11.194 --> 03:12.284
The handles are broke.

03:12.284 --> 03:14.134
First this latch broke.

03:14.134 --> 03:16.234
So this door just
kind of swings open.

03:16.234 --> 03:18.074
It doesn't lock shut.

03:18.074 --> 03:20.264
The men, back there, they
should be able to fix it.

03:20.264 --> 03:22.244
I think I'm a pretty
democratic boss.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.184
Open your freezer.

03:23.184 --> 03:24.124
Get me some pancetta.

03:25.294 --> 03:28.214
Joe gets very easily
flustered and frustrated,

03:28.214 --> 03:30.000
which a lot of times, winds
up making everybody breakdown.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.244
which a lot of times, winds
up making everybody breakdown.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.094
Ev, you
got the broccoli raab?

03:33.094 --> 03:34.034
Gene, where's
the broccoli raab?

03:34.034 --> 03:35.054
I don't have any broccoli raab.

03:35.054 --> 03:36.044
I asked you
if you had broccoli raab.

03:36.044 --> 03:37.124
You said yes.
Come on.

03:37.124 --> 03:38.214
It took long enough.

03:38.214 --> 03:41.134
It's frustrating here because
food needs to come out quicker.

03:41.134 --> 03:43.104
That  should have
been done last night.

03:47.064 --> 03:48.114
I worry about Joe.

03:48.114 --> 03:49.114
I worry about stress level.

03:49.114 --> 03:50.054
I worry about Melissa.

03:50.054 --> 03:51.094
I worry about the boys.

03:51.094 --> 03:53.184
It is not easy.

03:53.184 --> 03:56.034
I'm
financially in trouble.

03:56.034 --> 03:58.144
The debt of the restaurant
alone is overwhelming.

03:58.144 --> 04:00.000
My personal debt, wife, kids,
mortgage, that's a lot of debt.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.054
My personal debt, wife, kids,
mortgage, that's a lot of debt.

04:03.054 --> 04:06.254
You put everything
into one venture.

04:06.254 --> 04:11.064
It's takes a lot of
courage, you know?

04:11.064 --> 04:13.164
I owe my
purveyors about $80,000

04:13.164 --> 04:15.074
right now, in cold hard cash.

04:15.074 --> 04:17.114
I'll get something
out to you on Monday.

04:18.284 --> 04:22.104
Some of the purveyors will
show up and ask for a check.

04:22.104 --> 04:24.194
But I don't know if it's
the economy or what.

04:24.194 --> 04:26.124
I can't see
us going on another year.

04:26.124 --> 04:28.194
And that's a really
scary thought.

04:28.194 --> 04:30.000
And I'm going to do everything
in my power to avoid that.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.054
And I'm going to do everything
in my power to avoid that.

04:35.324 --> 04:37.164
I'm
looking for a restaurant,

04:37.164 --> 04:39.314
an Italian restaurant on the
main strip here, Campania.

04:39.314 --> 04:41.154
Oh?

04:41.154 --> 04:42.194
Thank you.

04:42.194 --> 04:45.104
Campania.

04:45.104 --> 04:48.294
Hardly a perfect location for
a restaurant, on a strip mall.

04:48.294 --> 04:50.264
But let's be honest, it's
the food that counts.

04:50.264 --> 04:53.304
And I've heard they've
got problems, eh?

04:53.304 --> 04:54.244
Oh, dear.

04:54.244 --> 04:55.184
Hello.

04:55.184 --> 04:56.154
Hey, are we one?

04:56.154 --> 04:57.264
Oh, yes, today I'm on my own.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.204
Yes, follow me please.

04:58.204 --> 05:00.000
In fact, most times,
I'm always one my own.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.074
In fact, most times,
I'm always one my own.

05:00.074 --> 05:01.114
- How are you today?
- Good.

05:01.114 --> 05:02.094
- How you doing?
- Well, thank you.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.134
Here you go, sir.
You're welcome.

05:03.134 --> 05:03.482
Excuse me.

05:03.482 --> 05:04.174
Lovely, thank you.

05:04.174 --> 05:05.114
You're welcome.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.104
Mr. Ramsay.

05:09.104 --> 05:10.084
How are you, man?

05:10.084 --> 05:11.184
I'm Joe Cerniglia.

05:11.184 --> 05:12.154
Good to see you.

05:12.154 --> 05:15.064
Welcome to New Jersey.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.034
Is this uh-- are
you always pointing?

05:17.034 --> 05:18.104
Or is that just--

05:18.104 --> 05:19.164
I point a lot.
I use my hands.

05:19.164 --> 05:20.174
You know, I'm southern Italian.

05:20.174 --> 05:23.164
So there's a lot of that.

05:23.164 --> 05:24.164
All right.

05:24.164 --> 05:25.134
That's the way I am.

05:25.134 --> 05:26.114
It's the way I operate.

05:26.114 --> 05:28.184
I don't know what
he was looking at.

05:28.184 --> 05:30.000
OK, what
would you like today?

05:30.000 --> 05:30.204
OK, what
would you like today?

05:30.204 --> 05:31.274
May I start please--

05:34.054 --> 05:34.393
Yes.

05:34.393 --> 05:37.044
And then I'll try the ravioli.

05:37.044 --> 05:37.383
OK.

05:37.383 --> 05:40.084
Finish with the pistachio
and cranberry-crusted breast

05:40.084 --> 05:41.064
of chicken.
-Thank you.

05:41.064 --> 05:41.403
Thank you.

05:41.403 --> 05:43.164
You're welcome.

05:43.164 --> 05:44.134
Ready to go, Joseph.

05:44.134 --> 05:45.074
Clam white.

05:45.074 --> 05:46.284
Tortellini soup.

05:46.284 --> 05:49.034
I mean, I was smiling,
but my heart was racing.

05:49.034 --> 05:51.044
Backing that up with
the tortellini soup?

05:51.044 --> 05:52.194
Boss, I got a
tortellini soup working.

05:52.194 --> 05:53.194
And I got my half rav working.

05:53.194 --> 05:54.134
I got it all.

05:57.456 --> 05:59.134
What'd you say?

05:59.134 --> 06:00.000
Sounds like a very, very
busy kitchen back there.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.164
Sounds like a very, very
busy kitchen back there.

06:02.164 --> 06:03.184
I'm so  hungry.

06:03.184 --> 06:04.284
- Oh, so what?
- Ugh!

06:04.284 --> 06:06.034
I didn't eat anything all day?

06:07.174 --> 06:08.144
You're hungry?

06:08.144 --> 06:09.084
I'm hungry.

06:09.084 --> 06:10.174
I'm hungrier.

06:10.174 --> 06:12.274
What is going on in there?

06:12.274 --> 06:15.154
God.

06:15.154 --> 06:16.254
The brow.

06:16.254 --> 06:17.254
Relax.

06:22.084 --> 06:23.084
Ah.

06:23.084 --> 06:24.254
I thought you'd gone home.

06:24.254 --> 06:25.194
No.

06:25.194 --> 06:26.134
No.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.184
I hope
Gordon's satisfied.

06:32.184 --> 06:37.094
If he's not, I'm sure
he's going to let us know.

06:37.094 --> 06:41.134
It's just
bland and tasteless.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.144
That one was definitely
not worth the wait.

06:43.144 --> 06:44.224
How is everything?

06:44.224 --> 06:45.294
Are they made here, these?

06:45.294 --> 06:46.274
Or are they brought in?

06:46.274 --> 06:48.144
They're filled with veal.

06:48.144 --> 06:49.154
Oh, no, I know.
Trust me.

06:49.154 --> 06:50.164
I know what it is.
-Oh, I know.

06:50.164 --> 06:50.508
OK, I'm sorry.

06:50.508 --> 06:51.284
That wasn't the
question I asked.

06:51.284 --> 06:52.264
They're homemade.

06:52.264 --> 06:54.234
Yes, they're brought in from a
place that makes them homemade.

06:54.234 --> 06:55.174
Thank you.

06:55.174 --> 06:57.214
Is it popular?

06:57.214 --> 06:58.274
Um, somewhat.

06:58.274 --> 07:00.000
I love the way
you skip over it.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.114
I love the way
you skip over it.

07:01.114 --> 07:02.224
Are they popular?

07:02.224 --> 07:04.244
Not too many people
order it as much, no.

07:04.244 --> 07:05.194
So no.

07:05.194 --> 07:06.134
Thank you then.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.174
You're welcome.

07:07.174 --> 07:08.114
Hmm.

07:08.114 --> 07:09.304
I think Gordon's
going to drive me crazy,

07:09.304 --> 07:11.044
by the end of it all.

07:11.044 --> 07:12.074
He's going to
drive us all crazy.

07:12.074 --> 07:14.214
Homemade means made on site.

07:14.214 --> 07:15.164
End of story.

07:15.164 --> 07:17.274
Cut the crap.

07:17.274 --> 07:20.094
Fill 'er up.

07:20.094 --> 07:25.034
All right, let's take 'em out.

07:25.034 --> 07:26.174
Ah, thank you.

07:26.174 --> 07:27.174
You're welcome.

07:27.174 --> 07:28.254
So this is the grilled
sausage in there, yes?

07:28.254 --> 07:29.064
Yes. yes.

07:29.064 --> 07:29.436
Lovely.

07:33.044 --> 07:34.164
Garlic everywhere.

07:34.164 --> 07:36.114
Big, big, big chunks
of it everywhere.

07:36.114 --> 07:37.194
Aye, yai, yai.

07:37.194 --> 07:39.194
You wouldn't want to go back
to the office with that breath,

07:39.194 --> 07:40.314
would you?

07:40.314 --> 07:44.044
Gordon found that we had
too much garlic in our sauce.

07:44.044 --> 07:45.124
I tend to like garlic.

07:45.124 --> 07:47.064
So I never really noticed it.

07:47.064 --> 07:48.144
OK.
Thank you.

07:48.144 --> 07:49.104
OK, you're welcome.

07:49.104 --> 07:50.154
Thank you very much.

07:50.154 --> 07:52.074
I would like a
toothbrush now, please.

07:52.074 --> 07:54.094
He wants you to know,
it was too much garlic.

07:54.094 --> 07:56.174
Stupid bitch.

07:56.174 --> 07:57.194
I think it was just fine.

07:57.194 --> 07:59.114
Personally, for me,
if I was eating that,

07:59.114 --> 08:00.000
I wouldn't have a
problem with it.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.044
I wouldn't have a
problem with it.

08:07.174 --> 08:08.194
-Here you go.
-Excellent.

08:08.194 --> 08:09.134
Pistachio chicken.

08:09.134 --> 08:10.264
What
is that, on top there?

08:10.264 --> 08:11.274
That is
grilled zucchini.

08:11.274 --> 08:12.234
OK.

08:12.234 --> 08:14.064
Holy mackerel.

08:14.064 --> 08:15.194
It looks like a bison's tongue.

08:18.084 --> 08:18.423
It's dry.

08:18.423 --> 08:19.324
It's sweet.

08:19.324 --> 08:22.304
And it's-- oh dear.

08:22.304 --> 08:24.144
He
didn't like the chicken.

08:24.144 --> 08:25.084
Didn't like the sauce.

08:25.084 --> 08:26.084
Didn't like the crust.

08:26.084 --> 08:27.054
Thought it was well done.

08:27.054 --> 08:27.393
Hated it.

08:31.274 --> 08:33.104
One
thing that fascinated me

08:33.104 --> 08:34.254
throughout that whole
lunch, all I could hear

08:34.254 --> 08:36.194
was laughing and joking,
and lots of screaming

08:36.194 --> 08:37.294
come out of the kitchen.

08:37.294 --> 08:39.124
I was pissed off waiting.

08:39.124 --> 08:40.154
You don't expect
to hear all that

08:40.154 --> 08:41.234
laughing and giggling
when you're sat

08:41.234 --> 08:43.114
there, waiting for your food.

08:43.114 --> 08:48.124
The tortellini of veal
was just bland and watery.

08:48.124 --> 08:51.054
Then my grilled sausage,
I've never seen so much

08:51.054 --> 08:52.324
garlic in addition all my life.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.154
Gordon
called me on my food.

08:54.154 --> 08:56.254
I'm not  happy.

08:56.254 --> 08:58.154
Italian food is
about rusticness,

08:58.154 --> 09:00.000
phenomenal ingredients,
and something

09:00.000 --> 09:00.064
phenomenal ingredients,
and something

09:00.064 --> 09:02.114
that's relaxed and casual,
but in a delicious way.

09:02.114 --> 09:03.054
Yeah.

09:03.054 --> 09:06.074
And I just found it you know,
somewhat boring, to be honest.

09:06.074 --> 09:07.174
You'll see us rock it out.

09:07.174 --> 09:08.324
God.

09:08.324 --> 09:12.144
My food, I think,
is pure and honest and good.

09:12.144 --> 09:15.044
I think that it was a
mistake that I did this.

09:15.044 --> 09:15.423
me.

09:18.304 --> 09:19.244
Up next--

09:19.244 --> 09:21.234
Why did you decide to
become a chef/owner,

09:21.234 --> 09:23.194
if you haven't got a clue
how to run a business?

09:23.194 --> 09:25.084
--Gordon
serves up the truth.

09:25.084 --> 09:27.124
I've never seen such
humongous portions.

09:27.124 --> 09:28.154
You wouldn't eat
that, would you?

09:28.154 --> 09:29.254
Can Joe swallow it?

09:29.254 --> 09:30.000
No.
All right, you know what?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.114
No.
All right, you know what?

09:31.114 --> 09:32.264
Why are we making a
public issue of this now?

09:32.264 --> 09:34.094
There's customers here.
There's customers here.

09:34.094 --> 09:35.274
I'd rather have this
conversation downstairs.

09:35.274 --> 09:37.114
How about that?
-What, do you want, a fight?

09:37.114 --> 09:39.184
And when the
staff monkeys around--

09:40.154 --> 09:41.094
You!

09:41.094 --> 09:42.244
Gordon goes bananas.

09:42.244 --> 09:44.324
Right, who's going home?

09:44.324 --> 09:47.842
That's coming up
on "Kitchen Nightmares."

09:52.264 --> 09:55.224
Day two-- and
with this restaurant

09:55.224 --> 09:58.074
in financial hell,
Gordon knows that he

09:58.074 --> 10:00.074
needs to increase business.

10:00.074 --> 10:02.274
But he also needs to
find ways to cut costs.

10:02.274 --> 10:04.224
I've been
thinking about this overnight.

10:04.224 --> 10:06.174
And what's bugging
me now is what's

10:06.174 --> 10:07.314
he wasting in his fridges?

10:07.314 --> 10:10.064
That's my concern now.

10:10.064 --> 10:13.044
This must be a pain in the ass.

10:13.044 --> 10:14.294
The minute a mussel opens,
they're no longer fresh.

10:14.294 --> 10:15.284
They're gone.

10:15.284 --> 10:16.284
That's dangerous.

10:16.284 --> 10:18.074
That's-- it's dead.

10:18.074 --> 10:19.184
Mussel's dead.

10:19.184 --> 10:20.290
This menu is far too
big for his own good.

10:20.290 --> 10:21.194
This menu is far too
big for his own good.

10:21.194 --> 10:23.144
Well, I don't understand
what's going through his mind,

10:23.144 --> 10:25.324
to have this fridge stocked
with all these ingredients,

10:25.324 --> 10:27.184
and no customers to cook for.

10:27.184 --> 10:30.264
Look, bag after bag, after bag.

10:30.264 --> 10:33.204
There's nearly two months'
worth of chopped garlic there.

10:33.204 --> 10:37.144
This is where his $80,000 debt
is, in all this ingredients.

10:37.144 --> 10:40.104
This fridge is stocked,
now, like a restaurant

10:40.104 --> 10:43.094
that would be fully booked for
three, four weeks in advance.

10:43.094 --> 10:44.264
And we haven't got
those customers.

10:44.264 --> 10:47.284
So why the  have we
got all this ingredient?

10:47.284 --> 10:50.214
Stupid, absolutely crazy.

10:50.214 --> 10:50.290
With a
young head chef,

10:50.290 --> 10:52.074
With a
young head chef,

10:52.074 --> 10:55.164
and an inexperienced owner,
Gordon decides it's time

10:55.164 --> 10:57.234
for restaurant management 101.

10:57.234 --> 10:58.294
You're in charge
of the purchasing.

10:58.294 --> 11:00.074
Yeah?
-Yes.

11:00.074 --> 11:04.164
Those fridges are stocked
up for-- a busy restaurant.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.134
We haven't got money to waste.

11:06.134 --> 11:07.294
There's endless
ingredients in there that

11:07.294 --> 11:09.154
are not being used properly.

11:09.154 --> 11:12.054
Everything we buy
is costing money.

11:12.054 --> 11:13.224
I can point fingers
in every direction

11:13.224 --> 11:15.114
for the walk-ins being crowded.

11:15.114 --> 11:16.154
And it's a catch-22.

11:16.154 --> 11:18.284
Because if we run out of
something, Joe throws a fit.

11:18.284 --> 11:20.290
When was the
last time you had a budget?

11:20.290 --> 11:21.284
When was the
last time you had a budget?

11:21.284 --> 11:23.234
Per
week, it's $4,200.

11:23.234 --> 11:25.264
I don't think
we're scrutinizing

11:25.264 --> 11:26.294
what we're purchasing.

11:26.294 --> 11:31.084
I could go in there and
just give you $500 of waste.

11:31.084 --> 11:34.034
I saw that  walk-in in
a completely different light.

11:34.034 --> 11:36.284
I went holy.

11:36.284 --> 11:39.314
Hopefully Gordon's
economics lesson has sunk in.

11:39.314 --> 11:42.124
Now it's time to see
how this jovial bunch

11:42.124 --> 11:44.074
handles a dinner service.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.094
Which, given the
lack of customers,

11:46.094 --> 11:48.084
shouldn't be that difficult.

11:48.084 --> 11:49.104
You're going to get in trouble.

11:51.314 --> 11:53.234
Even so,
Gordon has to make

11:53.234 --> 11:56.294
sure these kids stay focused.

11:56.294 --> 11:57.234
OK, right.

11:57.234 --> 11:59.174
You-- you understand
what's going on?

11:59.174 --> 12:00.214
This is not party time.

12:00.214 --> 12:01.214
This is serious time.
-Yeah.

12:01.214 --> 12:03.034
Nothing
to do with friends.

12:03.034 --> 12:03.383
Take it  serious.

12:03.383 --> 12:04.224
I will.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.164
Run it like a boss.

12:05.164 --> 12:07.084
Let's go.

12:07.084 --> 12:09.174
But old
habits die hard.

12:09.174 --> 12:10.134
Missing something?

12:11.234 --> 12:12.254
Campania's like high school.

12:12.254 --> 12:15.094
Because it's, like, a really
close-knit social environment.

12:15.094 --> 12:16.304
So everybody, like,
really gets along.

12:20.234 --> 12:20.290
Yes.

12:20.290 --> 12:21.174
Yes.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.144
Yes.

12:22.144 --> 12:23.114
Yes.

12:23.114 --> 12:25.054
I'm probably, like,
the biggest flirt here.

12:25.054 --> 12:27.294
We just all feel very
comfortable around each other.

12:27.294 --> 12:30.034
While Campania
Restaurant is really more

12:30.034 --> 12:32.284
like Campania High,
Gordon wants Joe

12:32.284 --> 12:36.234
to start treating it more like a
business and less like a party.

12:36.234 --> 12:37.264
Two second?
Everybody.

12:37.264 --> 12:38.204
Yes?

12:38.204 --> 12:39.304
Here we go.

12:39.304 --> 12:40.314
Right.

12:40.314 --> 12:46.244
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

12:46.244 --> 12:48.084
11 members of staff.

12:48.084 --> 12:50.164
Staff costs, right?

12:50.164 --> 12:50.290
Who's going home?

12:50.290 --> 12:53.154
Who's going home?

12:53.154 --> 12:55.264
That was pretty
blatant and it's a big move.

12:55.264 --> 12:56.234
Real big move.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.154
Gordon definitely
means business.

12:58.154 --> 12:59.134
Business.

12:59.134 --> 13:00.194
Sorry guys, thanks for coming.

13:00.194 --> 13:02.214
But thanks, but no thanks.

13:02.214 --> 13:05.044
It's a little scary
when Gordon, all of a sudden,

13:05.044 --> 13:05.390
eyeballs you.

13:05.390 --> 13:07.054
Who's going home?

13:11.304 --> 13:12.244
Trucks.

13:12.244 --> 13:13.294
See you, buddy.

13:13.294 --> 13:15.234
Go play guitar.

13:15.234 --> 13:16.174
Good.

13:16.174 --> 13:17.164
Take care, buddy.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.064
Give yourself a haircut.

13:20.064 --> 13:20.290
Next?

13:20.290 --> 13:20.436
Next?

13:20.436 --> 13:21.304
I need
three on the floor,

13:21.304 --> 13:22.324
three waiters on the floor.

13:22.324 --> 13:23.264
Let's go.

13:23.264 --> 13:26.104
Who's next?

13:26.104 --> 13:28.084
Katie.

13:28.084 --> 13:29.244
Katie,
thanks but no thanks.

13:29.244 --> 13:31.114
Any questions?

13:31.114 --> 13:32.154
- I
- cut a few people.

13:32.154 --> 13:33.194
They were clearly upset.

13:33.194 --> 13:35.064
You know, Katie was
definitely upset.

13:35.064 --> 13:35.403
Katie?

13:35.403 --> 13:36.244
No.

13:36.244 --> 13:38.114
Get out of my  face.

13:38.114 --> 13:39.314
I had to
make a tough call tonight.

13:39.314 --> 13:42.044
And I really wanted
to have people tonight

13:42.044 --> 13:43.264
that were on their game.

13:43.264 --> 13:45.114
I'm good enough
when he needs me,

13:45.114 --> 13:49.304
when his ass is on the line,
but not for-- that I came

13:49.304 --> 13:50.290
in tonight and
cancelled dinner plans

13:50.290 --> 13:51.134
in tonight and
cancelled dinner plans

13:51.134 --> 13:52.154
on all my friends for this.

13:52.154 --> 13:53.124
Whatever.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.174
Good luck.

13:54.174 --> 13:55.114
Let's go.

13:59.174 --> 14:02.234
With the staff now
trimmed down, playtime is over.

14:02.234 --> 14:04.114
- Good evening, madame.
- Hi.

14:04.114 --> 14:05.064
How're you?

14:05.064 --> 14:05.403
Good to see you.

14:05.403 --> 14:08.184
And it's time
to focus on the customers.

14:08.184 --> 14:09.204
So it was one order, or two?

14:09.204 --> 14:11.044
I'll have the mussels too.

14:11.044 --> 14:11.383
So two orders.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.224
OK.

14:12.224 --> 14:13.244
Order in please.

14:13.244 --> 14:14.294
Appetizers walking in.

14:14.294 --> 14:16.234
Salad, risotto,
mussels, mozzarella.

14:16.234 --> 14:19.114
Entrees are pork, brodetto,
a cod, and a chicken.

14:19.114 --> 14:20.164
I'll just get the chicken also.

14:20.164 --> 14:20.290
OK.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.124
OK.

14:21.124 --> 14:22.224
Come on.

14:22.224 --> 14:24.124
As orders
hit the kitchen,

14:24.124 --> 14:26.244
the staff is
quickly overwhelmed.

14:26.244 --> 14:29.074
And everything is moving
at a snail's pace.

14:29.074 --> 14:30.294
How many of these did you sell?

14:30.294 --> 14:31.284
Guys, come on.

14:31.284 --> 14:32.224
Don't lose it.

14:32.224 --> 14:34.084
Look, I had
some polenta wedges.

14:34.084 --> 14:36.034
They went back there
and they're lost.

14:36.034 --> 14:36.393
They're right here.

14:36.393 --> 14:37.264
They're not made.

14:37.264 --> 14:39.254
me.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.194
Excuse me?

14:40.194 --> 14:43.264
Is there any possible way we
could get our shrimp cocktail?

14:43.264 --> 14:45.094
That's what
Campania is known for,

14:45.094 --> 14:47.094
is waiting three
hours for your food.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.074
Are you guys OK?

14:49.074 --> 14:50.064
We're getting restless.

14:50.064 --> 14:50.290
Yeah.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.054
Yeah.

14:51.054 --> 14:52.104
Everyone's hungry.

14:52.104 --> 14:54.064
It's been taking a long
time for the appetizers.

14:54.064 --> 14:55.324
I'm starving.

14:55.324 --> 14:58.274
And not surprisingly,
problems in the kitchen

14:58.274 --> 15:02.264
have customers
totally frustrated.

15:02.264 --> 15:04.104
I want to drink
wine, then wine, then

15:04.104 --> 15:06.034
wine, then wine, then wine.

15:06.034 --> 15:07.174
Cheers, guys.

15:08.164 --> 15:09.304
Vinny's
authentic pizza.

15:09.304 --> 15:10.244
Yeah, how you doing?

15:10.244 --> 15:12.084
I'd like to place an
order for a pizza.

15:12.084 --> 15:13.174
Where
the  is 13?

15:13.174 --> 15:14.314
That  never went out?

15:14.314 --> 15:16.264
Oh,
come on,  hell.

15:16.264 --> 15:17.234
It was nuts.

15:17.234 --> 15:18.254
It was crazy.

15:18.254 --> 15:20.054
I need that risotto, Joe!

15:20.054 --> 15:20.290
What, one more?

15:20.290 --> 15:20.393
What, one more?

15:20.393 --> 15:23.044
No, it's
on your table, Joe!

15:23.044 --> 15:24.074
Joe!
-Yes?

15:24.074 --> 15:25.274
It's on
your  table, my man!

15:25.274 --> 15:26.254
Holy.

15:26.254 --> 15:27.304
Come on.

15:27.304 --> 15:29.094
Were you guys sitting
here for a while

15:29.094 --> 15:30.104
before anybody came to you?

15:30.104 --> 15:31.134
It's 30 minutes for a salad.

15:31.134 --> 15:33.214
I had people pointing at me,
and they're going like this.

15:33.214 --> 15:34.174
And I don't understand.

15:34.174 --> 15:37.114
I can't tell them, you know,
how hard it is to put lettuce

15:37.114 --> 15:39.054
- in a bowl, with some dressing.
- Come on guys.

15:39.054 --> 15:39.413
Come on, come on, come on.

15:39.413 --> 15:41.054
We're getting backed up now.

15:41.054 --> 15:41.423
I'm waiting on a cod.

15:41.423 --> 15:42.274
Come on, table three.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.234
Sell me that cod!

15:43.234 --> 15:44.214
I'm trying to fix it!

15:44.214 --> 15:46.244
You passed it to me broken.

15:46.244 --> 15:49.184
And when the food
finally arrives at the tables,

15:49.184 --> 15:50.290
it's met with mediocre reviews.

15:50.290 --> 15:51.244
it's met with mediocre reviews.

15:51.244 --> 15:53.194
The worst thing you can do
with fish is overcook it.

15:53.194 --> 15:54.174
Yeah.

15:54.174 --> 15:56.134
This is
Grade-D dog food.

15:56.134 --> 15:58.044
Just stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

15:58.044 --> 15:58.396
- Joe?
- Yes?

15:58.396 --> 15:59.294
Guys, I'm sorry.

15:59.294 --> 16:01.084
But I'm not
serving that.

16:01.084 --> 16:01.423
Yeah?

16:01.423 --> 16:02.304
And I'm not serving that.

16:02.304 --> 16:04.104
So will you please
stop what you're doing

16:04.104 --> 16:05.304
and do something about it?

16:05.304 --> 16:06.294
Guys?

16:06.294 --> 16:08.184
Another
observation by Gordon

16:08.184 --> 16:10.214
of this restaurant's
inefficiency,

16:10.214 --> 16:12.294
is its portion size.

16:12.294 --> 16:17.234
Almost every customer
leaves with a doggy bag.

16:17.234 --> 16:18.294
Unbelievable.

16:18.294 --> 16:20.074
Right.

16:20.074 --> 16:20.290
And huge portions
mean unnecessary inflated food

16:20.290 --> 16:22.324
And huge portions
mean unnecessary inflated food

16:22.324 --> 16:23.264
costs.

16:27.064 --> 16:28.304
I've made the
decision, bite the bullet

16:28.304 --> 16:30.074
on the portion sizes.

16:30.074 --> 16:32.134
I think that's what
the people like.

16:32.134 --> 16:34.164
What's uh-- what's
wrong with that?

16:34.164 --> 16:35.124
Nothing is wrong with it.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.054
They're just going
to take it home.

16:36.054 --> 16:37.034
They're taking it away?

16:37.034 --> 16:38.154
They're taking it away.

16:38.154 --> 16:39.154
Oh my god.

16:39.154 --> 16:40.294
Even the  dog's
got a serving there.

16:40.294 --> 16:41.324
There's the bone
for him as well.

16:41.324 --> 16:42.264
Yeah.

16:42.264 --> 16:43.294
That's a lot of food.

16:43.294 --> 16:46.234
Losing business big time.

16:46.234 --> 16:48.134
As Campania's
customers leave

16:48.134 --> 16:50.290
with their massive
leftovers, Gordon

16:50.290 --> 16:50.324
with their massive
leftovers, Gordon

16:50.324 --> 16:53.224
knows it's not just the
food they're taking,

16:53.224 --> 16:55.164
but Joe's profits as well.

16:55.164 --> 16:56.104
Sit down.

16:56.104 --> 16:57.214
Sit down.

16:57.214 --> 16:59.094
Did you
want all this food now?

16:59.094 --> 17:00.244
Do you have friends with you?

17:00.244 --> 17:01.234
Yeah.

17:01.234 --> 17:04.134
And right now, you're my guest.

17:04.134 --> 17:05.094
OK.

17:05.094 --> 17:06.164
Yeah.

17:06.164 --> 17:09.114
Let me just point two
or three things out.

17:09.114 --> 17:12.074
This is two appetizers,
two entrees,

17:12.074 --> 17:14.234
mixed salad and your brushetta.

17:14.234 --> 17:18.254
I'm trying to show you what
you give your customers

17:18.254 --> 17:20.290
every day, lunch and dinner.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.254
every day, lunch and dinner.

17:21.254 --> 17:24.284
I've never seen such
humongous portions.

17:24.284 --> 17:27.214
Every customer that left here
this evening took food to go.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.094
It's what the
customers are used to.

17:29.094 --> 17:30.144
The customers love this.

17:30.144 --> 17:32.054
They like the big portions.

17:32.054 --> 17:34.264
For a man that's
financially and

17:34.264 --> 17:38.224
and thrown money, literally,
down the drain for every dish

17:38.224 --> 17:39.274
you put in here.

17:39.274 --> 17:41.274
And then on top of that,
you can't even

17:41.274 --> 17:43.314
grill a piece of
brushetta there.

17:43.314 --> 17:45.254
You see that bit there?

17:45.254 --> 17:50.094
You wouldn't eat
that, would you?

17:50.094 --> 17:50.290
Huh?

17:50.290 --> 17:51.174
Huh?

17:51.174 --> 17:52.114
No.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.074
Talk to me.

17:53.074 --> 17:54.104
No.

17:54.104 --> 17:55.184
You getting upset now?

17:55.184 --> 17:56.184
Yeah, I'm getting real upset.

17:56.184 --> 17:57.264
Thank  god for that.

17:57.264 --> 18:00.114
Hopefully I'll get
through to you now.

18:00.114 --> 18:03.284
You've thrown thousands
of dollars down the drain.

18:03.284 --> 18:06.284
Why did you decide to go into
business if you haven't got

18:06.284 --> 18:09.194
a clue how to run a business?

18:09.194 --> 18:10.194
All right, you know what?

18:10.194 --> 18:12.184
Why don't we make it a
public issue with this now?

18:12.184 --> 18:13.324
There's customers here.
There's customers here.

18:13.324 --> 18:15.194
I'd rather have this
conversation downstairs.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.134
How about that?

18:16.134 --> 18:17.104
Are you scared again?

18:17.104 --> 18:18.044
Am I scared?

18:18.044 --> 18:19.224
You're embarrassing me
in front of my customers.

18:33.662 --> 18:34.792
Behind every restaurant,
there's a family.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.622
And when the
restaurant's in trouble,

18:36.622 --> 18:37.612
it's the family that suffers.

18:37.612 --> 18:39.842
So I want to get to
Joe's wife, Melissa,

18:39.842 --> 18:41.712
and just actually
find out what's

18:41.712 --> 18:43.812
really going on in Joe's mind.

18:43.812 --> 18:44.752
Hi.

18:44.752 --> 18:45.722
Hey, how are you?

18:45.722 --> 18:46.562
Melissa, how are
you, my darling?

18:46.562 --> 18:47.692
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise, good to see you too.

18:47.692 --> 18:48.602
-Thank you.
-Are you well?

18:48.602 --> 18:49.572
Boys home from school?

18:49.572 --> 18:50.592
Uh-huh, they are.
- Yeah?

18:50.592 --> 18:51.702
And how are you doing, my man?
First name?

18:51.702 --> 18:52.672
Evan.

18:52.672 --> 18:53.832
Evan,
nice to see you.

18:53.832 --> 18:54.622
Thank you.

18:54.622 --> 18:55.662
Girlfriend's name?

18:55.662 --> 18:56.712
Well, this is a nice house.

18:56.712 --> 18:56.739
Oh, thank you.

18:56.739 --> 18:57.702
Oh, thank you.

18:57.702 --> 18:59.562
How long
have you been here?

18:59.562 --> 19:00.662
- Four years.
- Four years, lovely.

19:00.662 --> 19:01.632
Yeah.

19:01.632 --> 19:02.832
So three boys?

19:02.832 --> 19:04.552
Three boys.

19:04.552 --> 19:05.592
Big
responsibility.

19:05.592 --> 19:05.931
Yep.

19:05.931 --> 19:08.742
A lot of pressure
on Joe's shoulders.

19:08.742 --> 19:10.552
How do you think he's doing?

19:10.552 --> 19:11.662
He's very positive.

19:11.662 --> 19:13.582
And you know, it's his dream.

19:13.582 --> 19:15.722
And I know he's giving it
his all to try and succeed.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.822
But you know--

19:17.822 --> 19:19.802
It's not just all about being
passionate in the kitchen.

19:19.802 --> 19:20.842
That's what I'm
trying to tell him.

19:20.842 --> 19:21.782
I know.

19:21.782 --> 19:24.612
And whilst I love his
enthusiasm around the food,

19:24.612 --> 19:25.632
it's a business.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.672
It's not just the food.

19:26.672 --> 19:26.739
I agree with you, 100%, I do.

19:26.739 --> 19:28.752
I agree with you, 100%, I do.

19:28.752 --> 19:29.792
And I don't know.

19:29.792 --> 19:31.712
I mean, that's why
I'm glad you're here.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.822
I mean, I think he needs to
see the black and white more.

19:34.822 --> 19:38.582
The hardest thing for me is that
people like us put everything

19:38.582 --> 19:40.772
on the line for a dream.

19:40.772 --> 19:45.782
And I just want to see him have
the time, you know, to succeed.

19:45.782 --> 19:47.592
Please
don't get upset.

19:47.592 --> 19:49.602
I don't want you to get upset.

19:49.602 --> 19:49.974
Please.

19:54.682 --> 19:56.592
He needs
to know the jeopardy.

20:09.672 --> 20:11.602
But his
business can be turned around.

20:11.602 --> 20:13.592
And I've pointed out
two or three things.

20:13.592 --> 20:14.632
Yes, it can.

20:14.632 --> 20:15.682
Yes, it definitely can.

20:16.822 --> 20:17.762
Yes.

20:17.762 --> 20:18.702
Now.

20:21.562 --> 20:23.562
Having given
Melissa his word,

20:23.562 --> 20:26.572
Gordon now knows that to
turn this business around,

20:26.572 --> 20:26.739
he must spend time in the
kitchen, retraining the chefs.

20:26.739 --> 20:29.722
he must spend time in the
kitchen, retraining the chefs.

20:29.722 --> 20:33.592
From food prep, to presentation.

20:33.592 --> 20:35.612
I've watched
the way we serve food here.

20:35.612 --> 20:37.812
No one really gives any
care and attention to

20:37.812 --> 20:38.842
a little bit of presentation.

20:38.842 --> 20:39.822
I know it's rustic.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.692
But at least make sure
that we got a little bit

20:41.692 --> 20:42.682
of pride in what we're doing.

20:42.682 --> 20:44.742
That looks like.

20:44.742 --> 20:46.682
You can do better.

20:46.682 --> 20:48.662
Having Gordon
Ramsay, in the kitchen,

20:48.662 --> 20:49.672
that was pretty cool.

20:49.672 --> 20:50.822
He's on top of his game, man.

20:50.822 --> 20:52.592
That's why he is where he is.

20:52.592 --> 20:53.622
Just keep it flat.

20:53.622 --> 20:55.622
Yeah, it's
just, it's breaking apart.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.562
I don't know.

20:57.702 --> 20:59.792
Yeah, but you always salt
it, like you do, like, with

20:59.792 --> 21:00.822
brandade or like a.

21:00.822 --> 21:02.762
You salt it so it
gets nice and firm.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.842
Put it there.

21:03.842 --> 21:04.822
He's one sharp cookie.

21:04.822 --> 21:05.802
I can tell you that much.

21:05.802 --> 21:08.622
Basically, he's teaching
us that we have to step up.

21:08.622 --> 21:09.682
OK, chicken.

21:09.682 --> 21:10.782
Cut off the drum and
the thigh and then

21:10.782 --> 21:12.552
set them on top of
one another, so it

21:12.552 --> 21:13.562
just looks a little bit neater.

21:13.562 --> 21:14.592
Yeah?

21:14.592 --> 21:16.662
Now that Gordon
has given Joe and the chefs

21:16.662 --> 21:18.722
several pointers,
it's time for Gordon

21:18.722 --> 21:22.672
to introduce a signature dish
they can handle-- meatballs.

21:22.672 --> 21:23.772
Why
can't this restaurant

21:23.772 --> 21:25.562
become famous for a meatball?

21:25.562 --> 21:26.739
I go to my restaurant in
Siciliy for the meatballs.

21:26.739 --> 21:26.802
I go to my restaurant in
Siciliy for the meatballs.

21:26.802 --> 21:27.742
That's all I want.

21:27.742 --> 21:28.802
Just give me meatballs.

21:28.802 --> 21:30.672
Gordon
showed us meatballs.

21:30.672 --> 21:31.812
I think it's a great idea.

21:31.812 --> 21:32.752
Let's go.

21:32.752 --> 21:34.602
A little bit of cheese on there.

21:34.602 --> 21:35.602
Good.

21:35.602 --> 21:37.842
I think us being known
for the meatballs isn't so bad.

21:37.842 --> 21:40.692
Because we're usually
known for food

21:40.692 --> 21:41.782
never really coming out ever.

21:44.642 --> 21:46.592
With the aid
of Gordon's recipe,

21:46.592 --> 21:50.552
Joe and his staff are now armed
with outstanding meatballs.

21:50.552 --> 21:52.562
Now it's time to
conquer New Jersey.

21:52.562 --> 21:53.682
Meatballs.

21:53.682 --> 21:54.622
Oh!

21:54.622 --> 21:55.612
Look at this!

21:55.612 --> 21:56.739
New Jersey's
best meatballs!

21:56.739 --> 21:57.632
New Jersey's
best meatballs!

21:59.582 --> 22:01.822
I do Jersey's--
yes-- best meatballs.

22:01.822 --> 22:02.782
OK.

22:02.782 --> 22:03.752
Joe, give out the T-shirts.

22:04.752 --> 22:06.742
Stick them--

22:06.742 --> 22:10.692
Out came the meatballs and the
flashy t-shirts and the hats.

22:10.692 --> 22:12.812
And we pretty much shouted
a message loud and clear,

22:12.812 --> 22:15.572
Campania's got the best
meatballs in New Jersey.

22:15.572 --> 22:16.702
Give
these meatballs away.

22:16.702 --> 22:18.832
And get the reputation
out there on the street.

22:18.832 --> 22:19.772
Yes?

22:19.772 --> 22:20.822
Hey, don't
mull around, folks!

22:20.822 --> 22:24.622
We got the best
meatballs around!

22:24.622 --> 22:25.722
-Mm.
-Stop on in.

22:25.722 --> 22:26.739
Have some dinner
one of these days.

22:26.739 --> 22:26.772
Have some dinner
one of these days.

22:26.772 --> 22:28.732
If we can start getting
people into our restaurant

22:28.732 --> 22:30.672
for our meatballs,
it's just a great step

22:30.672 --> 22:31.612
in the right direction.

22:31.612 --> 22:33.762
Now, let me
put some hot sauce on there.

22:33.762 --> 22:35.762
That was so much fun.

22:35.762 --> 22:36.702
That's wonderful.

22:36.702 --> 22:37.802
We got some meatball fans!

22:37.802 --> 22:38.742
You're a darling.

22:38.742 --> 22:40.812
There we are.

22:40.812 --> 22:43.662
Everyone
loved the meatballs.

22:43.662 --> 22:44.742
Does that
dog like meatballs?

22:44.742 --> 22:45.752
I think he does.

22:45.752 --> 22:46.702
Look at him.

22:46.702 --> 22:47.752
He loves it.

22:47.752 --> 22:48.842
Campania Restaurant.

22:48.842 --> 22:49.832
Campania Restaurant.

22:49.832 --> 22:50.822
We gave out some food.

22:50.822 --> 22:52.712
We spread the word
about the restaurant.

22:52.712 --> 22:53.742
We had some fun.

22:53.742 --> 22:55.632
You know you want 'em.

22:55.632 --> 22:56.739
Just don't get hit
by a car for 'em.

22:56.739 --> 22:58.622
Just don't get hit
by a car for 'em.

22:58.622 --> 22:59.822
The best meatballs
in New Jersey!

23:04.582 --> 23:06.722
Now that the meatball
marketing has spread the word

23:06.722 --> 23:08.792
about Campania,
it's time for Gordon

23:08.792 --> 23:12.792
to have a serious
one-on-one talk with Joe.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.662
You bought it 18 months ago.

23:14.662 --> 23:16.772
Over a period of 18 months,
how much have you lost?

23:16.772 --> 23:19.582
Yeah, I'd say about $120,000.

23:19.954 --> 23:20.762
I'm in trouble.

23:20.762 --> 23:23.772
How serious is this
restaurant for you?

23:23.772 --> 23:25.692
It's everything to me.

23:25.692 --> 23:26.739
You think you could
continue like this

23:26.739 --> 23:26.782
You think you could
continue like this

23:26.782 --> 23:28.752
for what, six more months?

23:28.752 --> 23:29.742
About that.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.662
Yeah, I think
that's pushing it.

23:31.662 --> 23:35.762
Your business is about to
swim down the Hudson.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.712
I heard
Gordon's point loud and clear.

23:37.712 --> 23:38.652
I mean, this is it.

23:38.652 --> 23:40.692
This is crunch time.

23:40.692 --> 23:41.782
Stand strong.

23:41.782 --> 23:43.572
Don't take it personally.

23:43.572 --> 23:45.572
Just take it seriously.

23:45.572 --> 23:48.712
Tomorrow is the biggest day.

23:48.712 --> 23:51.762
Coming up--
it's Campania's reopening.

23:51.762 --> 23:53.772
And everyone is
feeling the pressure.

23:53.772 --> 23:55.602
I need your specials now!

23:55.602 --> 23:56.739
She said the steak
was too tough.

23:56.739 --> 23:56.772
She said the steak
was too tough.

23:56.772 --> 23:59.632
Gordon has some quiet
time with an unruly customer.

23:59.632 --> 24:00.792
You're
talking out your rear.

24:00.792 --> 24:02.652
And while
some people welcome

24:02.652 --> 24:03.672
the changes to the menu--

24:03.672 --> 24:04.722
Absolutely
unbelievable.

24:04.722 --> 24:05.832
--others
aren't so sure.

24:05.832 --> 24:07.592
I felt like I was eating Ragu.

24:07.592 --> 24:09.642
It's a night
filled with emotions.

24:09.642 --> 24:11.562
Why did you keep eating,
if it was that bad?

24:11.901 --> 24:14.702
And a dinner service
you don't want to miss.

24:14.702 --> 24:17.480
Next, on "Kitchen Nightmares."

24:22.622 --> 24:25.672
It's day four, and
time for Campania's relaunch.

24:25.672 --> 24:28.792
Gordon's design team has come
up with a contemporary new look

24:28.792 --> 24:31.562
to match the new direction
of the restaurant.

24:31.562 --> 24:33.682
I've created a new look
for the new Campania.

24:33.682 --> 24:34.622
Let's go.

24:35.602 --> 24:37.562
Oh my god!

24:38.662 --> 24:39.612
How cool is that?

24:39.612 --> 24:40.632
Isn't that nice?

24:40.632 --> 24:41.572
Holy crap.

24:41.572 --> 24:41.911
Awesome.

24:41.911 --> 24:43.832
Oh, how cute it that?

24:43.832 --> 24:45.572
- Oh my god!
- So cool!

24:45.572 --> 24:46.642
Oh,
it's unbelievable.

24:46.642 --> 24:47.772
I was just absolutely
blown away.

24:47.772 --> 24:49.258
Absolutely blown away.

24:49.258 --> 24:49.562
Absolutely blown away.

24:49.562 --> 24:50.752
And it was just high time
for it to be changed.

24:51.742 --> 24:54.582
Now you can
really see it's a restaurant.

24:54.582 --> 24:55.752
All the lights are on.

24:55.752 --> 24:56.732
All the canopy's lit.

24:56.732 --> 24:58.662
It just looks
really inviting now.

24:58.662 --> 24:59.812
It's awesome.
We definitely needed this.

24:59.812 --> 25:01.812
It looks like
a proper restaurant now.

25:01.812 --> 25:02.572
It does, definitely.

25:02.572 --> 25:03.682
Thank
you guys so much.

25:03.682 --> 25:05.622
Melissa, happy?
Yes?

25:05.622 --> 25:07.612
Gordon has created
so many great new things here.

25:07.612 --> 25:08.792
Like, the sign and
everything, shows

25:08.792 --> 25:09.822
that he's making it better.

25:12.652 --> 25:13.712
Love
the colors, huh?

25:13.712 --> 25:14.842
- It's so nice.
- Let's get inside.

25:14.842 --> 25:16.612
- Yes?
- Let's do it.

25:16.612 --> 25:17.672
The one thing
you're not going to smell

25:17.672 --> 25:18.772
when we get in here is garlic.

25:21.682 --> 25:22.622
Hey!

25:22.622 --> 25:24.682
I open those doors,
and it was just alive.

25:24.682 --> 25:25.632
The restaurant was alive.

25:25.632 --> 25:27.672
The whole place just
metamorphosized with some

25:27.672 --> 25:28.842
great, simple little changes.

25:28.842 --> 25:30.842
The dining room
looks unbelievable.

25:30.842 --> 25:33.722
Those candles are
going to be awesome at night.

25:33.722 --> 25:34.662
Yes.

25:34.662 --> 25:35.622
Is it nice?

25:35.622 --> 25:36.572
Oh, I love them!

25:36.572 --> 25:36.920
This
is the kind of place

25:36.920 --> 25:37.692
I just want to hang out.

25:37.692 --> 25:38.842
I am a little
overwhelmed right now.

25:38.842 --> 25:40.732
I have really no words to say.

25:40.732 --> 25:42.562
You know, I was
a little shocked.

25:42.562 --> 25:43.812
When the lights are
dim, the music is on.

25:43.812 --> 25:46.712
right?

25:46.712 --> 25:47.742
Less clutter there.

25:47.742 --> 25:48.802
This place is lovely.

25:48.802 --> 25:49.258
You guys have
transformed my restaurant.

25:49.258 --> 25:50.612
You guys have
transformed my restaurant.

25:50.612 --> 25:51.672
Follow me through
to the kitchen.

25:51.672 --> 25:52.612
Let's go.

25:52.612 --> 25:53.812
Oh no.

25:53.812 --> 25:54.822
Joe's stressed out a lot.

25:54.822 --> 25:57.732
So when you see him smile like
that, it makes you feel good.

25:57.732 --> 25:58.712
Come through.

25:58.712 --> 26:00.842
Oh my god, this is
so freaking cool.

26:00.842 --> 26:03.552
Launched the menu, a new stove.

26:03.552 --> 26:03.891
Yeah?

26:04.732 --> 26:07.692
I'm overwhelmed
with this big, beautiful stove.

26:07.692 --> 26:09.612
You know, boys with toys?

26:09.612 --> 26:10.822
This is my new toy
right here, baby.

26:14.752 --> 26:16.642
Gene almost
had tears in his eyes,

26:16.642 --> 26:17.682
big, mean Gene.

26:17.682 --> 26:19.258
I know have to light the
pilots every time I turn it on.

26:19.258 --> 26:19.702
I know have to light the
pilots every time I turn it on.

26:19.702 --> 26:21.552
It's just phenomenal.

26:21.552 --> 26:21.908
Happy?

26:21.908 --> 26:22.842
Good.

26:22.842 --> 26:23.782
Good, good, good.

26:23.782 --> 26:26.622
I'm just so happy to
see him getting a little help.

26:26.622 --> 26:29.612
He deserves to succeed.

26:29.612 --> 26:31.752
And I just-- I know he's gonna.

26:31.752 --> 26:34.692
Gordon also provided
smaller plates to coincide

26:34.692 --> 26:35.782
with the smaller portions.

26:35.782 --> 26:37.572
Oh my god, new plates?

26:37.572 --> 26:37.954
They're smaller.

26:37.954 --> 26:39.612
Check it out.

26:39.612 --> 26:40.662
The plates were
just way too big.

26:40.662 --> 26:42.802
And therefore, we had to use a
lot more food to fill them up.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.612
And that's also losing
money right there.

26:45.612 --> 26:46.562
Wow, man.

26:46.562 --> 26:46.901
I am speechless.

26:46.901 --> 26:48.822
You guys have done so
much for us in one day.

26:48.822 --> 26:49.258
I don't know what to say.

26:49.258 --> 26:49.772
I don't know what to say.

26:52.842 --> 26:55.772
Next step in getting
ready for the big night, Gordon

26:55.772 --> 26:59.632
sits down with the young chefs
to introduce a brand new menu.

26:59.632 --> 27:02.832
OK, the secret of the
menu is to keep it tight.

27:02.832 --> 27:04.782
We have to start making money.

27:04.782 --> 27:06.702
I had some
initial concern about what

27:06.702 --> 27:08.692
my customers would think
about coming in and not

27:08.692 --> 27:10.562
seeing my big, diverse menu.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.562
This menu
includes the new pasta

27:12.562 --> 27:12.941
and risotto section.

27:12.941 --> 27:15.562
And the fettuccine,
something you'd expect

27:15.562 --> 27:16.792
to see in any nice restaurant.

27:16.792 --> 27:18.772
But do it with a
little bit more varied,

27:18.772 --> 27:19.258
you know, pesto tomato Alfredo.

27:19.258 --> 27:20.592
you know, pesto tomato Alfredo.

27:20.592 --> 27:21.742
I like the new menu a lot.

27:21.742 --> 27:24.552
Gordon's a-- that's-- he's
one sharp  cookie.

27:24.552 --> 27:24.944
I can tell you that much.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.742
The braised
pork, that's a great dish.

27:26.742 --> 27:28.752
The creamy polenta
coats the pork.

27:28.752 --> 27:29.692
The flavor's lovely.

27:29.692 --> 27:31.812
And then the bistecca, you know,
a really nice grilled New York

27:31.812 --> 27:33.702
Strip steak with roasted
potatoes and spinach,

27:33.702 --> 27:34.642
beautifully done.

27:34.642 --> 27:37.632
The meatballs, we've done it
in both appetizer and entree

27:37.632 --> 27:38.572
as well.

27:38.572 --> 27:39.752
We've now focused
on our meatball

27:39.752 --> 27:41.642
as becoming a bit of a hallmark.

27:41.642 --> 27:43.782
If people start bitchin'
the meatballs are going

27:43.782 --> 27:44.832
to come out of the kitchen.

27:44.832 --> 27:46.802
And hopefully that'll appease
them while they're waiting.

27:46.802 --> 27:47.772
Try the meatball.

27:47.772 --> 27:48.802
You're totally
going to like it.

27:48.802 --> 27:49.258
Try the meatball.

27:49.258 --> 27:50.652
Try the meatball.

27:50.652 --> 27:51.792
I really
like the new menu

27:51.792 --> 27:53.812
and the way we're doing
it, and the concept

27:53.812 --> 27:55.642
of having a smaller menu.

27:55.642 --> 27:56.592
Everything is good.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.632
This steak is awesome.

27:59.722 --> 28:01.792
An hour before
the opening, Gordon

28:01.792 --> 28:04.822
comes up with a clever way to
motivate the young waitstaff.

28:04.822 --> 28:07.752
I've devised
a plan-- the same plan I have

28:07.752 --> 28:12.692
with my waiters and waitresses--
that every item on this menu

28:12.692 --> 28:14.672
will be sold.

28:14.672 --> 28:16.582
Every item.

28:16.582 --> 28:16.921
Here we go.

28:16.921 --> 28:17.762
Come with me.

28:17.762 --> 28:18.722
Let's go.

28:18.722 --> 28:19.258
Up here is the menu.

28:19.258 --> 28:21.812
Up here is the menu.

28:21.812 --> 28:22.752
OK?

28:22.752 --> 28:25.802
And on these boards
are your names.

28:25.802 --> 28:28.592
Each and every one of you--
yeah-- have got to sell

28:28.592 --> 28:30.782
every item on this list.

28:30.782 --> 28:35.762
The first person finishes a
complete menu, you shout bingo.

28:35.762 --> 28:39.612
And there you've
got $100 incentive.

28:39.612 --> 28:42.582
The whole idea of having a
contest to motivate servers,

28:42.582 --> 28:43.712
I think it's a great idea.

28:43.712 --> 28:47.832
$100 to
sell the whole menu.

28:47.832 --> 28:49.258
I have a six o'clock
booking for table five.

28:49.258 --> 28:50.582
I have a six o'clock
booking for table five.

28:50.582 --> 28:50.943
-Perfect.
-OK.

28:50.943 --> 28:51.652
You ready?

28:51.652 --> 28:53.582
I am so  ready.

28:53.582 --> 28:54.612
We got to talk
together tonight.

28:54.612 --> 28:55.602
We got to work as a team.

28:55.602 --> 28:56.682
I'm going to step
up as much as I can.

28:56.682 --> 28:57.792
And hopefully it works out.

28:57.792 --> 28:58.762
You're expediting.

28:58.762 --> 29:00.692
You're delegating everybody
out the kitchen, right?

29:00.692 --> 29:01.632
That's me.

29:01.632 --> 29:03.572
I'm excited for
tonight's dinner service.

29:03.572 --> 29:04.832
I think everyone's going to
be on a good, positive note

29:04.832 --> 29:05.622
tonight.

29:05.622 --> 29:06.592
And
look at that oven.

29:06.592 --> 29:07.030
Unbelievable.

29:07.030 --> 29:08.612
Unbelievable.

29:08.612 --> 29:09.732
It's do or die for us.

29:09.732 --> 29:10.832
Failure's not an option.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.642
I'm not going to
let Gordon down.

29:12.642 --> 29:14.582
I have to show him
that we can do this.

29:14.582 --> 29:14.921
It's got to happen.

29:23.808 --> 29:26.658
Tonight is the
reopening of Campania--

29:26.658 --> 29:28.618
Darling, could
you open the doors please?

29:28.618 --> 29:29.828
--and Gordon
Ramsay's new menu

29:29.828 --> 29:30.878
has packed the restaurant.

29:30.878 --> 29:32.758
Welcome to Campania.

29:32.758 --> 29:34.898
Welcome to Campania.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.768
This is the night
Joe has been waiting for.

29:37.768 --> 29:40.888
But if it doesn't go well,
it could destroy his dream.

29:40.888 --> 29:42.708
This
is a big night for us.

29:42.708 --> 29:43.668
The pressure's on.

29:43.668 --> 29:44.007
Gene!

29:44.007 --> 29:45.648
First table's here.
Yes?

29:45.648 --> 29:45.987
Do it, guys.

29:45.987 --> 29:46.878
Big night.

29:46.878 --> 29:48.808
I want Gordon
to leave on a high note.

29:48.808 --> 29:50.758
I want to be able
to pull this off.

29:50.758 --> 29:51.059
Joe, is that-- write it down.
Spread the word.

29:51.059 --> 29:51.898
Joe, is that-- write it down.
Spread the word.

29:51.898 --> 29:52.838
OK?

29:52.838 --> 29:54.838
We're going to do a red
snapper in cartoccio.

29:54.838 --> 29:56.668
I'll be right
back in just a moment

29:56.668 --> 29:57.888
to take your orders, so
you can look over the menu.

29:57.888 --> 29:58.728
Thank you.

29:58.728 --> 29:59.858
Are you guys ready
to order your entrees?

29:59.858 --> 30:00.848
What are you having?

30:00.848 --> 30:01.788
Steak.

30:04.898 --> 30:05.838
Sure.

30:05.838 --> 30:06.858
I'll have the ravioli.

30:06.858 --> 30:07.798
Ravioli.

30:07.798 --> 30:08.738
Perfect.

30:08.738 --> 30:09.848
Thank you, guys.

30:09.848 --> 30:11.868
Listen, everything
sells together tonight.

30:11.868 --> 30:14.648
If somebody says their
food's ready in two minutes,

30:14.648 --> 30:15.688
it's two minutes.

30:15.688 --> 30:16.888
The first
orders are in.

30:16.888 --> 30:18.908
And Gordon's waiter
competition is underway.

30:18.908 --> 30:19.908
You're off.
Meatball's gone.

30:19.908 --> 30:20.848
What else?

30:20.848 --> 30:21.059
Chicken, chicken, chicken?

30:21.059 --> 30:22.618
Chicken, chicken, chicken?

30:22.618 --> 30:22.997
I just got a 10 top.

30:22.997 --> 30:24.658
I'm about to sell,
like, half of it.

30:24.658 --> 30:25.818
OK, go, girl, go.

30:25.818 --> 30:27.648
The first
customers of the night

30:27.648 --> 30:29.638
are responding well
to the new menu.

30:29.638 --> 30:30.908
You have to taste this.

30:30.908 --> 30:32.738
This is absolutely unbelievable.

30:32.738 --> 30:33.908
Best food I ever had.

30:33.908 --> 30:34.848
Good man.

30:34.848 --> 30:36.678
Like, the sauce was amazing.

30:36.678 --> 30:38.738
But even good food
can't impress everybody.

30:45.838 --> 30:46.828
That's horrible.

30:51.848 --> 30:52.888
Are you kidding?
Or--

30:52.888 --> 30:54.618
No, I'm not.

30:54.618 --> 30:54.977
Oh, you're serious?

30:54.977 --> 30:57.698
That, I
wouldn't even feed to my dog.

30:57.698 --> 31:00.708
Terrible.

31:00.708 --> 31:02.768
Everyone at the table doesn't
like any of their food.

31:02.768 --> 31:03.708
What should I do?

31:05.977 --> 31:08.828
Here I am, now, in
this pinnacle moment.

31:08.828 --> 31:10.878
And I start hearing
the complaints.

31:10.878 --> 31:13.698
It was almost too
bad to be true.

31:13.698 --> 31:14.728
You need to get feedback for me.

31:14.728 --> 31:15.668
OK?

31:15.668 --> 31:16.808
Why
didn't she like it?

31:16.808 --> 31:19.708
She said the steak
was too tough.

31:19.708 --> 31:20.648
Really?

31:20.648 --> 31:21.059
Which it doesn't
look tough to me.

31:21.059 --> 31:23.638
Which it doesn't
look tough to me.

31:23.638 --> 31:25.848
After Gordon sees
nothing is wrong with the food,

31:25.848 --> 31:28.718
he decides it's time to
stick up for his young chefs.

31:28.718 --> 31:29.808
What are you trying
to say, sweetheart?

31:32.708 --> 31:33.648
Really?

31:33.648 --> 31:34.888
Why don't you just take a
seat and just sit down and try

31:34.888 --> 31:35.838
to enjoy a cup of coffee?

31:40.828 --> 31:41.768
OK.

31:43.618 --> 31:43.957
OK, good.

31:43.957 --> 31:46.718
But madame, unfortunately,
you're talking out your rear.

31:49.818 --> 31:51.059
What, you're just walking
around looking for trouble.

31:51.059 --> 31:51.758
What, you're just walking
around looking for trouble.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.698
Why don't you just sit down and
stop trying to cause trouble?

31:54.698 --> 31:55.638
There we go.

31:58.698 --> 31:59.808
Ladies, welcome.
Good evening.

31:59.808 --> 32:00.838
Hi, how are you?

32:03.708 --> 32:06.758
An hour into dinner
surface, and menu bingo

32:06.758 --> 32:08.738
is achieving its
goal of customers

32:08.738 --> 32:10.868
ordering a wide variety
of items on the menu.

32:10.868 --> 32:12.738
I want to
see who's winning.

32:12.738 --> 32:14.778
Josette, at one,
two, three, four,

32:14.778 --> 32:16.738
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

32:16.738 --> 32:17.818
-I'm in second place.
-You are in second place.

32:17.818 --> 32:18.768
I'm halfway there.

32:18.768 --> 32:20.658
Now, the
pressure of the big night

32:20.658 --> 32:21.059
is taking its toll on Joe.

32:21.059 --> 32:21.828
is taking its toll on Joe.

32:21.828 --> 32:22.798
There's Too.

32:22.798 --> 32:23.828
Much saffron in that.

32:23.828 --> 32:24.838
There's too much.

32:24.838 --> 32:26.788
Oh,.

32:26.788 --> 32:28.718
When anything goes wrong--

32:28.718 --> 32:30.648
The cod looks like.

32:30.648 --> 32:31.728
Like, absolute.

32:31.728 --> 32:34.858
--Joe gets in that really
stressed-out panicky mode.

32:34.858 --> 32:36.798
Why is that taking
a long time, Joe?

32:36.798 --> 32:37.738
I worry about Joe.

32:37.738 --> 32:38.798
I worry about stress level.

32:38.798 --> 32:39.738
Huh?

32:39.738 --> 32:40.808
Why is that
taking a long time?

32:40.808 --> 32:43.628
Because those chickens
just got cooked.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.848
Are you  serious?

32:44.848 --> 32:45.848
I need salt.

32:45.848 --> 32:47.708
I'm
very reactionary.

32:47.708 --> 32:48.838
I get stressed out for,
like, five minutes.

32:48.838 --> 32:49.778
But you know what?

32:49.778 --> 32:51.059
I just try to find
that comfort zone.

32:51.059 --> 32:51.698
I just try to find
that comfort zone.

32:51.698 --> 32:53.698
I can tune things
out if I want to.

32:53.698 --> 32:54.738
Gene, I'm leaving
you guys be now.

32:54.738 --> 32:55.898
- What?
- I got to run out there.

32:55.898 --> 32:56.838
OK?

32:56.838 --> 32:58.648
Looking
for a little relief

32:58.648 --> 33:00.648
from the intensity
of the kitchen,

33:00.648 --> 33:02.668
Joe takes a stroll
into the dining room.

33:02.668 --> 33:03.738
Hey, Joe!
How are you?

33:03.738 --> 33:04.079
Hey!
How's it going?

33:04.079 --> 33:04.908
- Good, how're you?
- Go ahead, go ahead, talk.

33:04.908 --> 33:06.738
I'll see you in a bit, man, OK?

33:06.738 --> 33:07.898
We got all night to talk.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.668
How's it going, guys?

33:09.668 --> 33:10.838
You guys have
a horrible habit

33:10.838 --> 33:12.728
of dropping every
table in the restaurant

33:12.728 --> 33:13.678
at the same  time.

33:15.798 --> 33:16.828
Good talking to you guys.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.888
He's like Houdini.

33:17.888 --> 33:19.838
He's not around, and you
have to pick up the slack.

33:19.838 --> 33:20.848
- Gene?
- Yeah?

33:20.848 --> 33:21.059
It's getting crazy out there.

33:21.059 --> 33:21.848
It's getting crazy out there.

33:21.848 --> 33:22.888
Now, we've got to
step up a gear.

33:22.888 --> 33:23.678
- Yes?
- All right, guys.

33:23.678 --> 33:24.628
Come on.

33:24.628 --> 33:25.858
With Gene left
alone in the kitchen--

33:25.858 --> 33:26.808
One mussels left.

33:26.808 --> 33:28.708
--orders
are backed up.

33:28.708 --> 33:31.678
And customers are now
experiencing what Campania used

33:31.678 --> 33:33.748
to be known for, slow service.

33:33.748 --> 33:36.678
We've been here for 40 minutes
and I haven't eaten yet.

33:36.678 --> 33:39.788
We just had to do a lot
of things differently tonight.

33:39.788 --> 33:41.768
We've been here
since seven o'clock.

33:41.768 --> 33:44.788
Everything just took
a while to come out.

33:44.788 --> 33:45.838
It's insane, back there.

33:45.838 --> 33:47.868
But no, it's coming right out.

33:47.868 --> 33:49.628
I'm am so busy right now.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.059
I can't even breathe right now.

33:51.059 --> 33:51.818
I can't even breathe right now.

33:51.818 --> 33:54.678
Everyone's waiting
for two hours for their food.

33:54.828 --> 33:55.798
Is it really nine o'clock?

34:00.728 --> 34:02.728
They don't understand
what's taking so long.

34:06.868 --> 34:08.748
I have a table
with, like, eight people.

34:08.748 --> 34:09.688
They're upset.

34:09.688 --> 34:10.858
They want to speak to a manager.

34:12.658 --> 34:13.628
Dropping table 20.

34:13.628 --> 34:14.000
Hold on.

34:14.000 --> 34:14.808
Hold on.

34:14.808 --> 34:15.858
Everybody shut up.

34:15.858 --> 34:18.908
See, this is a
cluster.

34:18.908 --> 34:20.678
Guys, what's going on?

34:21.668 --> 34:23.658
I just can't
believe what I went through.

34:23.658 --> 34:24.628
I don't know what to say.

34:24.628 --> 34:24.967
I don't.

34:24.967 --> 34:26.618
I was out at the table.

34:26.618 --> 34:26.977
They had a complaint.

34:26.977 --> 34:28.788
They waited a long time.

34:28.788 --> 34:29.818
They weren't happy
with the food.

34:29.818 --> 34:30.898
I'm sorry about what
happened tonight.

34:32.818 --> 34:33.898
All
right, let me-- I--

34:33.898 --> 34:35.718
I got to run-- I got
to run back there.

34:36.668 --> 34:37.007
I'm sorry.

34:37.007 --> 34:37.848
No, I do.

34:40.758 --> 34:42.708
At that point,
you know, I really didn't

34:42.708 --> 34:43.708
want to be in that position.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.908
And I was really just trying
to back away from the table.

34:46.908 --> 34:48.818
The  pasta's going in.

34:48.818 --> 34:51.059
While Gene puts
out fires in the kitchen,

34:51.059 --> 34:51.618
While Gene puts
out fires in the kitchen,

34:51.618 --> 34:53.618
the angry customer
is making her way

34:53.618 --> 34:55.878
to the front of the restaurant,
and is now complaining

34:55.878 --> 34:57.858
in front of Joe's mom.

34:57.858 --> 34:59.808
She's out there,
complaining to these people.

34:59.808 --> 35:00.142
Is Joe out there?

35:00.142 --> 35:00.878
I don't know, I'm
very disappointed.

35:00.878 --> 35:02.728
Been here many, many times.
-No, the food was good.

35:02.728 --> 35:03.668
Really?

35:03.668 --> 35:04.858
I felt like I was eating Ragu.

35:04.858 --> 35:05.848
Oh, I didn't feel like that.

35:05.848 --> 35:06.838
I really did.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.818
Yeah, that one out there was
saying the food's like Ragu.

35:12.738 --> 35:13.818
Uh, well, somebody
else had the fish,

35:13.818 --> 35:15.788
and it tasted like pond water.

35:15.788 --> 35:16.778
I'm listening to this witch.

35:16.778 --> 35:17.888
I want to go strangle her.

35:17.888 --> 35:19.778
I was so aggravated.

35:19.778 --> 35:21.059
I was so upset, you
know, that somebody

35:21.059 --> 35:21.858
I was so upset, you
know, that somebody

35:21.858 --> 35:23.708
would do that to my son.

35:23.708 --> 35:25.778
While Joe could
not diffuse the situation

35:25.778 --> 35:27.868
with the unhappy
customer, shockingly,

35:27.868 --> 35:30.818
a less-than-sober but
satisfied customer

35:30.818 --> 35:32.678
comes to the
defense of Campania.

35:35.888 --> 35:37.878
Why did you keep eating
if it was that bad?

35:39.728 --> 35:40.868
If it was that bad?

35:40.868 --> 35:42.718
Because you's a  liars!

35:42.718 --> 35:44.858
You just want everything for
free, you greedy!

35:44.858 --> 35:47.848
Oh my god in heaven,
you people are mental.

35:47.848 --> 35:50.838
Go have another bottle of wine,
you  alcoholic.

35:50.838 --> 35:51.059
Have another bottle of
wine, you  lowlife.

35:51.059 --> 35:53.828
Have another bottle of
wine, you  lowlife.

36:04.668 --> 36:05.818
Why did you keep eating
if it was that bad?

36:08.658 --> 36:09.668
If it was that bad?

36:09.668 --> 36:10.788
Because you's a  liars!

36:10.788 --> 36:13.748
You just want everything
for free you greedy!

36:13.748 --> 36:16.718
Oh my god in heaven,
you people are mental.

36:16.718 --> 36:20.708
Go have another bottle of wine,
you  alcoholic!

36:20.708 --> 36:23.668
And keep  smoking,
you dirty.

36:23.668 --> 36:24.688
Italian, honey.

36:24.688 --> 36:27.658
Yeah,   Italian.

36:27.658 --> 36:27.997
Can I just be alone?

36:27.997 --> 36:29.758
Have
another bottle of wine,

36:29.758 --> 36:30.638
Have
another bottle of wine,

36:30.638 --> 36:30.977
you  lowlife!

36:34.708 --> 36:36.798
A police car
on neighborhood patrol

36:36.798 --> 36:40.628
extinguishes the fiery argument
outside the restaurant.

36:40.628 --> 36:41.828
OK, Joe, just two
seconds please.

36:41.828 --> 36:42.768
Let's go.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.618
Back in
the kitchen, Gordon

36:44.618 --> 36:46.678
asks to talk to Joe
privately, to get

36:46.678 --> 36:48.638
him focused and back on track.

36:48.638 --> 36:49.768
When you're pissed,
straight to the point.

36:49.768 --> 36:50.828
Over and done with, and move on.

36:50.828 --> 36:51.768
Do you understand?

36:51.768 --> 36:52.708
Yeah.

36:52.708 --> 36:53.718
Don't hide behind there.

36:53.718 --> 36:55.738
Step out into the dining
room two or three times.

36:55.738 --> 36:57.888
In with the customers,
30 seconds, back out.

36:57.888 --> 36:59.758
If anyone's disgruntled, put
an end to it immediately.

36:59.758 --> 37:00.688
If anyone's disgruntled, put
an end to it immediately.

37:00.688 --> 37:01.798
Don't stand there,
bargaining with them.

37:01.798 --> 37:02.738
Yeah.

37:02.738 --> 37:03.798
Just, and back in.

37:03.798 --> 37:05.718
But always, I want
to see you run it.

37:05.718 --> 37:06.668
Yeah.

37:06.668 --> 37:07.007
Yeah?

37:07.007 --> 37:08.678
- I
- have to get serious.

37:08.678 --> 37:11.678
It takes me a long
time to get something

37:11.678 --> 37:12.818
through my thick skull.

37:12.818 --> 37:15.678
But when it does
happen, I'm steadfast.

37:15.678 --> 37:16.628
I was going to do it.

37:16.628 --> 37:17.648
I believed in it.

37:17.648 --> 37:18.868
And when I believe in
something, I  do it.

37:18.868 --> 37:19.808
All right, here we go.

37:19.808 --> 37:21.658
Here we go. come on,
let's sell these.

37:21.658 --> 37:22.818
Let's sell these.
you got spinach?

37:22.818 --> 37:24.708
I want to make sure that
we're nice and vibrant.

37:24.708 --> 37:25.648
Yes?

37:25.648 --> 37:28.778
Right now, two steaks,
two veals, and a chicken.

37:28.778 --> 37:29.758
OK Every steak that comes
in now, right skirt.

37:29.758 --> 37:31.708
OK Every steak that comes
in now, right skirt.

37:31.708 --> 37:32.908
So we can tell the difference.
OK?

37:32.908 --> 37:33.848
OK.

37:33.848 --> 37:36.878
And now that Joe has
taken his mission seriously,

37:36.878 --> 37:39.728
it rubs off on his staff,
who are now working

37:39.728 --> 37:41.648
professionally and efficiently.

37:41.648 --> 37:42.748
Skirt steak.
Spread the word.

37:42.748 --> 37:43.708
- OK?
- I know.

37:43.708 --> 37:44.069
I've got it.

37:44.069 --> 37:44.898
Make
it a good thing.

37:44.898 --> 37:46.768
It's something special.

37:46.768 --> 37:47.878
Jess, ramekin.

37:47.878 --> 37:50.788
Now I think
Joe has motivation to do

37:50.788 --> 37:51.818
what he can to make it better.

37:51.818 --> 37:55.758
And he just inspired us
all to, I think, just work.

37:55.758 --> 37:58.868
Work as a team, communicate,
be a little more serious.

37:58.868 --> 37:59.758
They're catching you up now.

37:59.758 --> 37:59.878
They're catching you up now.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.678
Come on, come on, come on.

38:01.678 --> 38:02.898
The honey and the
strawberries, so good.

38:02.898 --> 38:05.698
Yep, there goes one more.

38:05.698 --> 38:06.888
OK, I'm going to start
the mozzarella over here.

38:06.888 --> 38:08.628
You've only got two left.

38:08.628 --> 38:08.967
Yes, I do.

38:08.967 --> 38:10.648
- Yeah?
- I'll have the shellfish.

38:10.648 --> 38:11.030
The shellfish?
Yes.

38:12.668 --> 38:13.778
Sold all my calm sauce.

38:13.778 --> 38:14.828
Told you I was gonna win.

38:14.828 --> 38:16.718
Does that mean a bottle
of wine or $100 for you?

38:16.718 --> 38:19.718
I'm gonna have the $100.
$100, I won tonight,

38:19.718 --> 38:21.648
just for playing bingo.

38:21.648 --> 38:22.748
But you know, I busted my butt.

38:22.748 --> 38:24.818
And I sold everything
I needed to sell.

38:24.818 --> 38:25.828
I knew I was going to win.

38:25.828 --> 38:27.688
I knew it.

38:27.688 --> 38:28.788
Server bingo
was definitely fun.

38:28.788 --> 38:29.758
The whole idea of having a
contest to motivate servers,

38:29.758 --> 38:31.758
The whole idea of having a
contest to motivate servers,

38:31.758 --> 38:32.838
I think it's a great idea.

38:32.838 --> 38:34.868
Ariana, I just won.

38:34.868 --> 38:36.788
Server bingo
was a really novel idea.

38:36.788 --> 38:37.848
And it worked.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.648
We were all talking
about it afterwards.

38:39.648 --> 38:40.778
Like, we want to
keep doing that.

38:40.778 --> 38:41.758
We liked the contest.

38:41.758 --> 38:42.698
That was fun.

38:42.698 --> 38:43.788
Can you guys handle
these pick ups now?

38:43.788 --> 38:44.848
There's not much more coming in.

38:44.848 --> 38:46.698
Really nothing was
going to stop me.

38:46.698 --> 38:48.768
Gordon really forced
the issue on me.

38:48.768 --> 38:50.788
And I really believed,
at that point,

38:50.788 --> 38:53.708
that these changes were good.

38:53.708 --> 38:54.838
Perfect.

38:54.838 --> 38:56.678
Jo, have somebody
follow you with it.

38:56.678 --> 38:57.618
OK.

38:57.618 --> 38:59.758
Joe was definitely more focused,
especially behind the line.

38:59.758 --> 38:59.868
Joe was definitely more focused,
especially behind the line.

38:59.868 --> 39:02.648
There was no practical
jokes going on.

39:02.648 --> 39:03.788
Really, really
enjoyed the food.

39:03.788 --> 39:05.698
It was great.

39:05.698 --> 39:06.768
It's cause we care.

39:06.768 --> 39:09.648
I was making sure that everybody
was on top of their game.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.638
And if they weren't, I'd
be there to help them out.

39:11.638 --> 39:12.718
What?

39:12.718 --> 39:13.066
Honey, you're doing
an awesome job.

39:13.066 --> 39:13.868
I'm so proud of you.

39:13.868 --> 39:15.708
I'm proud of you too!

39:15.708 --> 39:18.848
Get to work!

39:18.848 --> 39:20.698
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

39:20.698 --> 39:21.039
Have
a nice weekend.

39:21.039 --> 39:21.748
You too.

39:21.748 --> 39:23.828
Now that the last
tables have been served,

39:23.828 --> 39:25.798
Gordon gathers
the team together.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.748
The difference in
tonight's service,

39:27.748 --> 39:29.758
as opposed to last night's
service was night and day.

39:29.758 --> 39:30.818
as opposed to last night's
service was night and day.

39:30.818 --> 39:32.888
And we've done double
the amount of people

39:32.888 --> 39:34.658
tonight that we did last night.

39:34.658 --> 39:36.648
203, were in for dinner.

39:36.648 --> 39:38.638
We were consistent.

39:38.638 --> 39:39.848
The food was good.

39:39.848 --> 39:40.788
The service was good.

39:40.788 --> 39:44.768
And everybody had an appetizer,
an entree and dessert.

39:44.768 --> 39:47.638
What would be the take
come, what, midnight?

39:47.638 --> 39:49.768
I'd say, we took
in about $7,500.

39:49.768 --> 39:52.728
We made three
times what we made last night.

39:52.728 --> 39:53.858
I don't
think I've ever made

39:53.858 --> 39:55.868
the money that I made tonight.

39:55.868 --> 39:58.798
Tonight was a really
successful night.

39:58.798 --> 39:59.758
Really was.

39:59.758 --> 39:59.868
Really was.

39:59.868 --> 40:01.798
Aw!

40:01.798 --> 40:04.778
Hey, hey.

40:04.778 --> 40:05.818
There's no words.

40:05.818 --> 40:08.828
No words to tell you
how I feel about what

40:08.828 --> 40:10.638
Gordon's done for Joey.

40:10.638 --> 40:12.718
I am thrilled to death for him.

40:12.718 --> 40:13.878
And let
me tell you what I saw.

40:13.878 --> 40:17.758
You, tonight, showed me that
yes, you were a head chef.

40:17.758 --> 40:19.698
Don't stop.

40:19.698 --> 40:20.638
Don't stop.

40:21.698 --> 40:22.878
I think there's
good things in our future.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.668
I mean, we're going
to dig our heels in.

40:24.668 --> 40:26.778
And we've got a good groundwork
now, after Gordon came in here.

40:32.678 --> 40:33.808
In the
days that followed,

40:33.808 --> 40:35.868
customers were thrilled
with the new menu.

40:35.868 --> 40:36.808
Like, this is so good.

40:36.808 --> 40:38.648
It was delicious.

40:38.648 --> 40:39.708
What about the dessert?

40:39.708 --> 40:40.648
Is it?

40:40.648 --> 40:42.658
With sensible
portions, less waste

40:42.658 --> 40:44.748
in the fridge, and
more customers,

40:44.748 --> 40:45.888
profits increased dramatically.

40:45.888 --> 40:47.638
You
know, I'm happy.

40:47.638 --> 40:48.828
I like the food that's
going out the window.

40:48.828 --> 40:52.628
Happy customers, great
food, good bottom line.

40:52.628 --> 40:54.788
Joe finally
started behaving like a boss,

40:54.788 --> 40:55.878
and not everyone's friend.

40:55.878 --> 40:56.698
Chicken, you're going

40:56.698 --> 40:57.688
to sell two chickens for me.

40:57.688 --> 40:58.628
OK?

40:58.628 --> 40:59.758
Successfully taking
control of both the front

40:59.758 --> 41:00.688
Successfully taking
control of both the front

41:00.688 --> 41:01.628
of the house--

41:01.628 --> 41:01.997
Pleasure to meet you guys.

41:01.997 --> 41:02.868
and the kitchen

41:02.868 --> 41:03.808
OK, good.

41:03.808 --> 41:04.758
We're going to sell.

41:04.758 --> 41:06.728
Two steaks and a chicken.

41:06.728 --> 41:07.788
Somebody close that door!

41:07.788 --> 41:08.808
The food's going cold!

41:08.808 --> 41:11.848
And now, Campania
is known for its quality,

41:11.848 --> 41:13.808
rather than its quantity.

41:13.808 --> 41:16.808
With the staff now ready to
run a restaurant properly,

41:16.808 --> 41:18.888
there was one more thing
Gordon wanted to take

41:18.888 --> 41:21.638
care of before he said goodbye.

41:21.638 --> 41:22.898
The food
looked great on there.

41:22.898 --> 41:23.828
Yes?

41:23.828 --> 41:27.758
We're not going back to
stupid big steering wheels.

41:27.758 --> 41:29.718
That's what we're serving.

41:29.718 --> 41:29.758
Look at them.

41:29.758 --> 41:30.708
Look at them.

41:30.708 --> 41:31.808
Aren't they horrible?

41:33.728 --> 41:34.858
Let's go.

41:34.858 --> 41:36.688
yeah?
Do one.

41:36.688 --> 41:37.678
Say goodbye to them.

41:37.678 --> 41:38.798
Say goodbye.

41:38.798 --> 41:40.628
Say goodbye.

41:40.628 --> 41:41.698
- I
- tell you, breaking

41:41.698 --> 41:43.878
those plates was just,
like, the weight, you know,

41:43.878 --> 41:45.718
coming off my shoulders.

41:51.758 --> 41:54.878
When Gordon broke the
plates, we were, like, rock on.

41:54.878 --> 41:56.738
That's  awesome.

41:56.738 --> 41:58.798
Goodbye
to the big plate.

41:58.798 --> 41:59.758
Hello, profits.

41:59.758 --> 41:59.758
One, two, three, go.

41:59.758 --> 42:03.688
One, two, three, go.

42:04.678 --> 42:06.808
Joe, you're happy?

42:06.808 --> 42:07.808
So happy.

42:07.808 --> 42:09.618
The
breaking of the plates,

42:09.618 --> 42:10.628
how symbolic was that?

42:10.628 --> 42:11.618
Wasn't it awesome?

42:11.618 --> 42:12.818
Out with the old and
you know, into the new.

42:12.818 --> 42:13.808
Thank you.
Well done.

42:13.808 --> 42:14.748
Thank you.

42:14.748 --> 42:15.099
Well done, well
done, well done, well done,

42:15.099 --> 42:15.908
well done.

42:15.908 --> 42:16.848
Well done.

42:16.848 --> 42:17.858
Well done, big boy.

42:17.858 --> 42:18.798
Yes?

42:18.798 --> 42:19.768
Thank you.

42:19.768 --> 42:20.748
You know, you have
to see him go.

42:20.748 --> 42:21.688
But it was a good time.

42:21.688 --> 42:22.818
We got to break all
the  plates.

42:22.818 --> 42:25.758
He uh-- he was proud
of us, I think.

42:25.758 --> 42:27.638
Right, oh,.

42:27.638 --> 42:28.010
Thank you.

42:28.010 --> 42:29.728
Thank you so much.

42:29.728 --> 42:29.758
I think that Campania is
going to be everything

42:29.758 --> 42:32.748
I think that Campania is
going to be everything

42:32.748 --> 42:33.888
that Joey wants it to be.

42:33.888 --> 42:34.898
Goodnight, guys.

42:34.898 --> 42:36.678
First
day I met Gordon,

42:36.678 --> 42:37.878
I couldn't wait until
that guy said goodbye.

42:37.878 --> 42:40.658
But once I got beyond
my pride being hurt,

42:40.658 --> 42:41.728
and my ego being
hurt, and started

42:41.728 --> 42:43.748
listening to what
he had to say, he

42:43.748 --> 42:44.798
was like a true mentor to me.

42:44.798 --> 42:46.708
Customers have to come
back for the good food, not

42:46.708 --> 42:47.768
the portion size.
-Absolutely.

42:47.768 --> 42:48.808
-Remember that. yes?
-All right.

42:48.808 --> 42:49.748
Good luck.

42:49.748 --> 42:50.688
Thanks.

42:50.688 --> 42:52.618
You  meatball.

42:52.618 --> 42:52.967
Good luck.
Take care.

42:52.967 --> 42:53.818
All right.

42:53.818 --> 42:55.798
Hey-- don't stop.

42:55.798 --> 42:57.788
I won't.

42:57.788 --> 42:58.888
Joe
and the Campania gang

42:58.888 --> 42:59.758
were a fun group
to hang out with.

42:59.758 --> 43:00.728
were a fun group
to hang out with.

43:00.728 --> 43:03.718
But the lack of discipline
was killing the business.

43:03.718 --> 43:04.838
It feels like they've changed.

43:04.838 --> 43:05.818
I only hope it continues.

43:11.838 --> 43:13.708
Next, on
"Kitchen Nightmares"--

43:13.708 --> 43:16.658
Gordon faces the most
stubborn chef he's ever met--

43:16.658 --> 43:17.678
I thought your food was crap.

43:17.678 --> 43:18.728
That's a matter of opinion.

43:18.728 --> 43:20.668
--then
unearths the restaurant's

43:20.668 --> 43:21.858
dirty little secrets.

43:21.858 --> 43:22.838
Maggots, ugh.

43:22.838 --> 43:24.808
But this
French chef fights back.

43:24.808 --> 43:26.758
Is everything perfect
in your kitchen?

43:26.758 --> 43:28.828
Can Gordon
save The Secret Garden?

43:28.828 --> 43:29.758
This is the lowest day
of this restaurant's life.

43:29.758 --> 43:30.748
This is the lowest day
of this restaurant's life.

43:30.748 --> 43:33.788
Or will this stubborn
chef be his own worst enemy?

43:33.788 --> 43:35.848
Who the  are you
to turn around and tell me,

43:35.848 --> 43:37.648
when you work like a pig?

43:37.648 --> 43:38.688
You  pig!

43:38.688 --> 43:42.858
Get ready for the most
explosive "Kitchen Nightmares" yet.
