I'm madly in love with you.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.288
Oh, Jesse.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.044
I'm sorry..

18:06.085 --> 18:07.587
I'm sorry I got so jealous.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.006
Just the thought of losing you

18:07.628 --> 18:10.006
made me crazy.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.716
You're never gonna lose me.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.637
I'm sorry, Elena.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.182
Maybe I was crazy

18:18.389 --> 18:20.182
to have come here.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.352
But I always wondered

18:21.434 --> 18:23.352
what would happen

18:23.394 --> 18:25.438
if we ever saw

18:23.394 --> 18:25.438
each other again.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.149
Now I know,

18:26.856 --> 18:29.149
we can only be friends.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.152
It's too bad

18:30.443 --> 18:32.152
we are still married.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.700
[instrumental music]

18:38.993 --> 18:42.162
Well, what do you know,

18:38.993 --> 18:42.162
we lost the group.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.708
Iorgos is as long as we're here,

18:42.204 --> 18:45.708
let's talk divorce.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.461
Divorce?

18:45.750 --> 18:48.461
Who wants a divorce?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.463
- They do.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.799
Well, you are in luck.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.761
Since no farm animals

18:52.840 --> 18:56.761
actually changed hands

18:56.803 --> 18:59.346
a divorce is possible.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.473
Dad?

19:02.767 --> 19:04.936
Sylvio, I'm sorry

19:04.978 --> 19:06.270
but I'll never forget you.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.024
After all,

19:07.521 --> 19:10.024
you are my first husband.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.110
For one hour

19:12.151 --> 19:15.529
I was married to the most

19:12.151 --> 19:15.529
beautiful woman in the world.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.158
Aw, dad, do I have to?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.078
Oh, yeah.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.204
Everybody who wants

19:22.120 --> 19:24.204
a divorce, follow me.

19:26.540 --> 19:31.211

Okay, I now pronounce you,

19:39.053 --> 19:43.390
men and ex-wives.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.651
We came 12,000 miles

19:49.981 --> 19:53.651
to get divorces.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.904
We should've

19:53.693 --> 19:56.904
gone to Disneyland.

19:56.946 --> 20:00.908
Attention, everybody, you know,

19:56.946 --> 20:00.908
all this talking about divorce

20:00.950 --> 20:03.202
makes me realize

20:00.950 --> 20:03.202
how lucky I am

20:03.243 --> 20:05.872
to have my Gina

20:03.243 --> 20:05.872
for fifty years.

20:05.913 --> 20:09.750
And to think, she didn't even

20:05.913 --> 20:09.750
want to marry me!

20:09.792 --> 20:11.293
You had a beard!

20:11.335 --> 20:13.671
It was like

20:11.335 --> 20:13.671
kissing a goat!

20:13.713 --> 20:17.633
No, I kissed a goat once,

20:13.713 --> 20:17.633
it was very different.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.260
Anyway, I shaved.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.681
And I got 50 wonderful

20:20.302 --> 20:23.681
years with my Gina.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.350
[dramatic music]

20:26.392 --> 20:28.602
I love you, Gina.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.146
I love you.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.109
That's so beautiful.

20:38.029 --> 20:41.199
You know, that could be

20:38.029 --> 20:41.199
you and I in 50 years.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.616
I hope it will be.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.912
Like you know when..

20:45.953 --> 20:48.581
You're lucky enough to find

20:45.953 --> 20:48.581
the right person that you..

20:48.622 --> 20:50.457
...really love and wanna

20:48.622 --> 20:50.457
spend your whole life with

20:50.499 --> 20:53.044
my feeling is, why wait?

20:54.962 --> 20:57.506
Okay, so what are you

20:54.962 --> 20:57.506
waiting for?

20:59.466 --> 21:01.177
Really?

21:01.219 --> 21:02.929
Really.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.304
Alright.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.015
This time we're gonna

21:04.346 --> 21:06.015
do this right.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.773
You know, the last time we did

21:11.395 --> 21:13.773
this, you left me at the altar.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.191
Jess, we were in Nevada.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.443
You said,

21:15.233 --> 21:17.443
"let's get married this second."

21:17.484 --> 21:20.071
This time we can take our time

21:17.484 --> 21:20.071
and plan a real wedding.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.868
- Becky.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.868
- Hold it.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.913
Do you have any other wives

21:25.910 --> 21:28.913
in any other countries?

21:28.955 --> 21:31.249
- No, no.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.249
- Okay.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.711
You were saying?

21:37.130 --> 21:39.006
Will you walk around

21:37.130 --> 21:39.006
the table with me?

21:39.048 --> 21:40.967
- Yes.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.967
