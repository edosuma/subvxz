24:02.317 --> 24:03.983
it's no joke, Pop.

24:05.317 --> 24:08.692
Yeah, when I left, y'all were,
like,

24:08.775 --> 24:13.108
"It's gonna be great. Go show
'em who we are. Go represent."

24:13.858 --> 24:16.025
The truth is...

24:16.108 --> 24:19.983
is that most of the time I'm at
Stanford feels like a betrayal.

24:20.942 --> 24:22.942
<i>De verdad?</i> Of who?

24:23.025 --> 24:24.733
Of my family.

24:24.817 --> 24:26.192
My community.

24:26.275 --> 24:29.108
Like the dean, he invited me
to this diversity dinner.

24:29.192 --> 24:32.358
Super-wealthy donors, trustees,
the whole nine.

24:32.442 --> 24:35.608
And I wore this black cocktail
dress and I was walking to my seat,

24:35.692 --> 24:39.900
and one of the patrons shoved
her plate into my arms

24:39.983 --> 24:42.942
and said, "I ordered the
vegetarian option."

24:43.025 --> 24:44.608
- No.
- Yeah.

24:44.692 --> 24:48.733
And all the servers, all
Latino, shot me this look,

24:48.817 --> 24:50.608
like, "Ooh, what's this
<i>trigueña</i> gonna do?"

24:50.692 --> 24:55.483
"Ooh, what's she gon' do?
Is she with us? Or is she with them?"

24:55.567 --> 24:59.150
<i>Ah, bueno.</i> There's no
shame in waiting tables.

24:59.233 --> 25:01.025
And there's no shame
in having a different path.

25:01.942 --> 25:03.233
Like you.

25:08.025 --> 25:10.692
Dad... the deadline passed.

25:10.775 --> 25:13.108
The extension
on spring tuition.

25:13.192 --> 25:14.650
[speaking Spanish]

25:14.733 --> 25:16.317
- [in English] Yeah.
- But I didn't receive notice.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.150
Yeah, they let me finish off my
classes, but we owe them.

25:18.233 --> 25:21.400
No, don't you give it a second
thought. I'm on it. Hm?

25:21.483 --> 25:23.108
Dad...

25:23.192 --> 25:26.317
The deadline to pay and enroll
for next semester also passed.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.983
[speaking Spanish]

25:28.067 --> 25:29.942
[in English] How come you know
about all this before I do?

25:30.025 --> 25:33.733
I switched the info.
I gave the finance office my dorm address.

25:35.442 --> 25:37.317
Well, why would you do that?

25:37.400 --> 25:39.733
Because you sold half the business,
and it barely covered freshman year.

25:39.817 --> 25:41.525
I don't want you doing
something else crazy.

25:41.608 --> 25:45.108
- <i>Espera</i>, that sale pulled us out of debt.
- No, no.

25:45.192 --> 25:48.525
You and I both know that finances
were tenuous before getting into this.

25:48.608 --> 25:49.942
And this might not be feasible.

25:50.025 --> 25:51.942
- I'm gonna call them right now.
- Dad, Stanford's over.

25:52.025 --> 25:54.192
Stop overreacting,
Nina, please.

25:54.275 --> 25:56.233
- Dad, I'm serious.
- <i>Oye!</i>

26:03.525 --> 26:05.942
You don't tell me how much we
can afford.

26:11.692 --> 26:13.650
You're not the parent. Hm?

26:15.358 --> 26:18.275
God bless you. <i>Dios te bendiga.</i>

26:18.358 --> 26:19.942
[man] <i>Gracias!</i>

26:28.025 --> 26:30.067
[Abuela Claudia
speaking Spanish]

26:30.150 --> 26:32.400
What's all over those pipes?

26:32.483 --> 26:34.650
- Rust.
- Rust?

26:35.567 --> 26:37.025
Lovely.

26:37.108 --> 26:40.483
- [speaking Spanish]
- [in English] That's the roof.

26:40.567 --> 26:42.192
On the floor?

26:43.108 --> 26:45.275
<i>Ay, Usnavi.</i>

26:45.358 --> 26:47.775
<i>Tu eres un</i> workaholic.

26:47.858 --> 26:51.233
You think it will be different
in the Dominican Republic?

26:51.317 --> 26:52.900
Just like my <i>mamá.</i>

26:52.983 --> 26:57.567
Morning and night, year after
year... to what end?

26:57.650 --> 27:02.525
To wake up and scrub another
floor till the day she died.

27:02.608 --> 27:06.483
Yeah, but... here I work to
survive.

27:06.567 --> 27:09.442
<i>El Sueñito</i> will be a
labor of love.

27:09.525 --> 27:11.442
The <i>bodega</i> was only supposed
to be temporary,

27:11.525 --> 27:13.608
but now... I'm like, almost 30.

27:14.608 --> 27:16.525
The plan was always to go back.

27:18.192 --> 27:20.317
Hopefully, I won't be going
alone.

27:21.108 --> 27:22.983
You, me and Sonny?

27:23.067 --> 27:25.650
<i>Y Sonny?</i> Is he on board?

27:25.733 --> 27:27.775
He's my next ask.

27:27.858 --> 27:28.775
I'm not going without him.

27:28.858 --> 27:32.150
Look, I got Sonny.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.858
You know I can't go nowhere
without you.

27:37.608 --> 27:40.900
I took care of my community,
no?

27:40.983 --> 27:42.817
- Hell, yes!

[Sonny] I don't know, man.
Leave Washington Heights?

28:03.483 --> 28:05.608
I'd have to talk to my dad...

28:05.692 --> 28:07.483
[Usnavi] You're just a kid.

28:07.567 --> 28:09.733
You don't even know. For real.

28:11.358 --> 28:14.858

your mind.

Who's gonna greet you in DR?

28:31.900 --> 28:34.067
Some cousin you saw two
Christmases ago?

28:34.150 --> 28:37.150
Best days of my life
were there.

28:37.233 --> 28:38.733
[laughs]

28:38.817 --> 28:41.775
That's the corniest thing I've
ever heard.

28:41.858 --> 28:44.275
You came here when you was
eight.

28:44.358 --> 28:48.358
You got... "island memories."

28:48.442 --> 28:51.358
Not me. I was in Pampers
on that plane.

28:51.442 --> 28:53.400
NYC's my spot.

28:53.483 --> 28:58.358
I got my island, okay?
Go get yours.

28:58.442 --> 29:00.400
Don't forget how you got your
name.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.275
- Yo...
- Just, fix the fridge.

29:06.358 --> 29:09.275
Yeah, all right.
Bro, you think you're funny?

29:09.358 --> 29:10.858
What's "Usnavi" mean, anyway?

29:10.942 --> 29:12.400
That sounds weird.

29:12.483 --> 29:14.067
No, it doesn't.

29:14.150 --> 29:16.067
- All right. All right, all right, all right.
- [girl] Shut up.

29:16.150 --> 29:18.983
On my dad's first trip to
<i>Nueva York...</i>

29:19.067 --> 29:20.900
<i>he saw a passing ship on
the horizon.</i>

29:20.983 --> 29:26.442
And... he was, like, "Wow,
that's gonna be my son's name."

29:27.983 --> 29:31.483
- Usnavi!
- [all] Ohh...

<i>No, it has not passed. Would you
like to know the remaining balance?</i>

30:03.150 --> 30:05.067
Yes. I have a pencil.

<i>Sure, the balance that's due

You know what?
It's mad we allow ourselves to be hurt.

01:09:17.067 --> 01:09:22.274
You know, when Pike originally
approached me, he wanted the whole space.

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:24.483
So today, I reopened the
conversation.

01:09:24.567 --> 01:09:25.692
[speaking Spanish]

01:09:25.774 --> 01:09:27.733
- [in English] What?
- I knew it.

01:09:27.817 --> 01:09:30.149
I guess we're gonna do this
now, huh?

01:09:30.233 --> 01:09:31.108
[taps glass]

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:34.608
Nina... it was about your age

01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:37.649
that your mother and I,
God rest her soul, we came here

01:09:37.733 --> 01:09:40.899
and we emptied our savings to
put a down payment on Rosario's.

01:09:40.983 --> 01:09:44.817
Two burgundy Cadillacs,
that was your fleet!

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:46.774
Start small, dream big.

01:09:48.608 --> 01:09:50.899
I look at you, <i>mija,</i>
I see her.

01:09:50.983 --> 01:09:53.899
<i>Y te lo juro</i>, if she were here, she would've
done the same thing that I did today.

01:09:53.983 --> 01:09:55.483
Dad...

01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:56.733
I sold Rosario's.

01:09:56.817 --> 01:09:57.983
- <i>Felicidades!</i>
- What?

01:09:58.067 --> 01:10:00.025
- Raise a glass.
- <i>Felicidades!</i>

01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:03.358
- [speaking Spanish]
- [in English] Yes, get cash money!

01:10:03.442 --> 01:10:07.317
To Nina, who can now finish
what she started at Stanford.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.025
To Nina!

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.775
- To Nina.
- To Nina.

01:10:11.858 --> 01:10:14.233
Nina, say, "Thank you, <i>Papi."</i>

01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:17.525
Dad... the deadline passed.

01:10:17.608 --> 01:10:20.150
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- <i>Mentira, mentira!</i>

01:10:20.233 --> 01:10:22.442
Stop with the lying. I called
them.

01:10:24.317 --> 01:10:26.858
I called them!
Stop trying to protect me here.

01:10:26.942 --> 01:10:28.942
There were other things other
than the finances.

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:30.358
Did you not hear what I said?

01:10:30.442 --> 01:10:32.192
Yes, about the ignorant
<i>idiotas</i>...

01:10:32.275 --> 01:10:34.192
That's the same thing that
we foresaw when we came!

01:10:34.275 --> 01:10:35.567
- No, it's not the same thing, Dad.
- [speaking Spanish]

01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:37.525
[in English] It is not
the same.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:40.608
When you came here and Mom came
here, you all had a Latino community

01:10:40.692 --> 01:10:43.525
ready to welcome you, open
arms, babies and <i>abuelas,</i>

01:10:43.608 --> 01:10:46.942
and teachers and lawyers,
first generation, fifth generation...

01:10:47.025 --> 01:10:49.192
There's no community for me at
school.

01:10:53.442 --> 01:10:54.775
I got searched.

01:10:58.567 --> 01:10:59.775
Yeah.

01:11:00.733 --> 01:11:02.150
I got searched.

01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:06.608
On moving day...

01:11:08.483 --> 01:11:13.150
my roommate lost
her pearl necklace and...

01:11:13.233 --> 01:11:17.233
the RA and her parents
came in...

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:21.567
and searched me and they...

01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:25.567
emptied my drawers,
turned over my purse...

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:28.150
and I just stood there.

01:11:28.233 --> 01:11:31.733
I stood there
and didn't say anything.

01:11:31.817 --> 01:11:34.983
And then eventually,
they found it... in her bag.

01:11:37.025 --> 01:11:38.692
You're the best
we've got, Nina.

01:11:38.775 --> 01:11:40.608
If you can't stay in the ring,
what's that gonna say about us?

01:11:40.692 --> 01:11:42.942
You can't keep putting your
life's work on my shoulders, Dad.

01:11:43.025 --> 01:11:45.067
<i>Dile, mi gente,</i>
isn't she the best we got?

01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:47.233
And then I apologize
like an idiot.

01:11:47.317 --> 01:11:48.525
I stood there,
I didn't do anything,

01:11:48.608 --> 01:11:50.692
and then I apologized.

01:11:50.775 --> 01:11:51.442
Well, you keep
getting A's, baby,

01:11:51.525 --> 01:11:54.108
that's your revenge.

01:11:54.192 --> 01:11:55.775
- My God, you're not hearing her, Kevin.
- I'm not going back!

01:11:55.858 --> 01:11:57.275
- <i>Como?</i>
- I'm not going back!

01:11:57.358 --> 01:12:00.025
So all of my decisions
can just go to hell here?

01:12:00.108 --> 01:12:03.275
- I'm doing this for you!
- No, you're doing it for you!

01:12:03.358 --> 01:12:05.150
What if I refuse your money?

01:12:05.233 --> 01:12:06.983
What if I don't want it?

01:12:07.775 --> 01:12:10.233
[speaking Spanish]

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.442
[in English] I refuse.

01:12:22.733 --> 01:12:24.192

01:12:28.067 --> 01:12:28.983

01:12:29.067 --> 01:12:30.483
She refused.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.692

01:33:00.567 --> 01:33:02.108
Hey, Pop.

01:33:06.275 --> 01:33:08.483
Best days of my life.

01:33:20.483 --> 01:33:22.275
It's creepy quiet.

01:33:23.608 --> 01:33:26.442
Usually, the One Train's
up there, screeching.

01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:38.900
Yo, I was thinking...
there's so much stuff going on.

01:33:38.983 --> 01:33:43.650
And all it just got me thinking about is,
like... all the people I care about the most.

01:33:46.692 --> 01:33:47.983
And I just thought about you.

01:33:53.442 --> 01:33:55.733
You're about
to change zip codes.

01:33:55.817 --> 01:33:57.650
Country codes, actually.

01:33:57.733 --> 01:34:01.233
Yeah, but
that's not till August.

01:34:01.317 --> 01:34:03.608
I mean, you know, we got time.

01:34:03.692 --> 01:34:05.233
Usnavi...

01:34:08.192 --> 01:34:10.608
I'm the girl who paints nails.

01:34:10.692 --> 01:34:13.775
There's plenty like me,
here and over there.

01:34:13.858 --> 01:34:15.942
Stop!

01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:18.108
Yo, you're an artist.

01:34:29.192 --> 01:34:31.567
Yo, your senior year
lab book...

01:34:34.483 --> 01:34:37.400
I should've been paying
attention to the board, but...

01:34:39.817 --> 01:34:42.442
all them doodles you made.

01:34:42.525 --> 01:34:44.317
Yo, it was like...

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.817
<i>Wonder Woman</i> meets...

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.317
<i>The Simpsons</i> meets...

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:51.150
<i>Guernica.</i>

01:34:51.233 --> 01:34:53.317
- [Vanessa laughs]
- And I would...

01:34:54.233 --> 01:34:56.275
I would watch, like...

01:34:57.983 --> 01:35:00.983
I just want to see the whole
world through her eyes.

01:35:24.275 --> 01:35:26.483
[Kevin chuckles]
<i>Mira para allá.</i>

01:35:26.567 --> 01:35:30.233
Benny, you know,
before I bought Rosario's...

01:35:30.317 --> 01:35:32.233
it was O'Hanrahan's.

01:35:33.150 --> 01:35:35.900
The whole block was Irish.

01:35:35.983 --> 01:35:36.858
[chuckles]

01:35:39.942 --> 01:35:41.525
You know why I bought it?

01:35:41.608 --> 01:35:46.025
My dad, he, uh... he pulled me
out of high school,

01:35:46.108 --> 01:35:49.442
so that I could work on
the same farm as him.

01:35:49.525 --> 01:35:51.858
Making the same pennies.

01:35:51.942 --> 01:35:55.067
I thought to myself,
"No, no, no, <i>papi."</i>

01:35:55.150 --> 01:35:57.483
"That don't make no sense."

01:35:57.567 --> 01:36:01.442
I'm gonna drop out so somebody
else could get rich off of my work?

01:36:03.817 --> 01:36:05.483
So I came here.

01:36:06.567 --> 01:36:09.442
So I could make
my own damn work.

01:36:09.525 --> 01:36:13.358
But, you never
finished high school?

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.150
But Nina did.

01:36:40.025 --> 01:36:44.858
[Usnavi] <i>You asked me,
"What a</i> sueñito <i>means?"</i>

01:36:44.942 --> 01:36:46.442
I'm not gonna sit here
and give you

01:36:46.525 --> 01:36:49.025
some fairy tale version.

01:36:49.108 --> 01:36:54.400
You know, a dream isn't some
sparkly diamond we get.

01:36:54.483 --> 01:36:59.233
You know, sometimes, it's...
it's rough.

01:36:59.317 --> 01:37:01.025
And it's not so pretty.

01:37:01.108 --> 01:37:05.275
- Yeah!
- [speaking Spanish]

01:37:05.358 --> 01:37:08.858
[in English] DACA was not a gift
from some benevolent saint, right?

01:37:08.942 --> 01:37:11.525
- No.
- No!

01:37:11.608 --> 01:37:14.317
- [protest leader] You made it happen, you fought for it.
- Yes!

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.900
[protest leader] And that's why
it still continues now.

01:37:19.025 --> 01:37:22.483
'Cause what about the people who
don't qualify, like my niece, right?

01:37:22.567 --> 01:37:26.400
She gets into college
without papers, but...

01:37:26.483 --> 01:37:30.233
no work-study for her,
no federal aid for her

01:37:30.317 --> 01:37:32.983
so she doesn't get to go to college.
It's not right.

01:37:33.067 --> 01:37:37.400
- What did she say?
- She said her niece couldn't go to college.

01:37:37.483 --> 01:37:41.483
[protest leader] We can dream
bigger and better, right?

01:37:50.608 --> 01:37:51.942
Yo, Sonny!

01:38:02.942 --> 01:38:04.775
What's going on man?

01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:08.567
[protest leader]
Let's do this. Yes!

01:38:10.275 --> 01:38:11.900
I knew I couldn't
get a license.

01:38:13.858 --> 01:38:15.733
But no college?

01:38:15.817 --> 01:38:18.358
She was talking
about undocumented folks.

01:38:31.775 --> 01:38:35.692
<i>I remember when I was your age,
they used to say...</i>

01:38:35.775 --> 01:38:40.358
<i>"If you work hard
and you live by the rules,</i>

01:38:40.442 --> 01:38:44.192
the money will come,
the things will come.

01:38:44.275 --> 01:38:46.900
And that, those things
will complete you."

01:38:51.942 --> 01:38:53.442
But, they won't.

01:38:56.983 --> 01:39:02.733
<i>We work so hard to try and get there,
that we forget about what's right here.</i>

01:39:03.525 --> 01:39:05.983
I was gonna be like you.

01:39:06.067 --> 01:39:08.233

Dad, I know what I have to do.

01:39:38.025 --> 01:39:41.442
You've given me this amazing
education and I just need to use it,

01:39:41.525 --> 01:39:45.650
and figure out how every
undocumented kid gets a pathway.

01:39:47.525 --> 01:39:51.525
Maybe Stanford isn't a way out.
Maybe it's a way back.

01:39:51.608 --> 01:39:53.983
Like Abuela
always used to say...

01:39:54.067 --> 01:39:56.608
asserting our dignity
in small ways.

01:40:07.025 --> 01:40:08.233
Wow.

01:40:08.317 --> 01:40:10.650
This is it, huh, <i>mija?</i>

01:40:11.608 --> 01:40:12.942
What?

01:40:13.025 --> 01:40:14.525
This is the moment
when you do better than me.

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:17.608
Not because of
some fancy degree...

01:40:18.983 --> 01:40:21.442
It's 'cause you can
see a future that I can't.

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.692
Hey...

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.317
[in Spanish]

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.442
[in English] You're <i>Nuyoricua.</i>

01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:34.858
We're a people on the move,
so yeah, bring us with you.

01:40:37.358 --> 01:40:39.775
Ignore anyone who doubts you.

01:40:41.275 --> 01:40:45.567
You take all the bruises, baby,
but you stay in the ring.

01:41:19.442 --> 01:41:21.608
[Usnavi] <i>I called,
and it's still available.</i>

01:41:21.692 --> 01:41:26.358
But Vanessa needs a co-signer, and not
one who's about to leave the country.

01:41:27.942 --> 01:41:29.067
Would you?

01:41:30.775 --> 01:41:32.733
As a personal favor?

01:41:32.817 --> 01:41:34.442
We're all ready, ma'am.

01:41:37.983 --> 01:41:40.525
That's <i>señorita</i> to you.

01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:45.692
Yes. Yes, ma'am...
<i>Señorita.</i> Yes.

01:41:50.817 --> 01:41:54.150
<i>Listas.</i> We'll follow behind.

01:41:57.650 --> 01:42:00.233
- It's hotter in here.
- Put on the AC.

01:42:00.317 --> 01:42:03.567
[both speaking Spanish]

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:05.317
Come find me in the Bronx.

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:08.692
3843 Grand Concourse.

01:42:12.067 --> 01:42:13.858
Where the hell is everybody?

01:42:18.733 --> 01:42:22.025
<i>Diablo.</i> It's like
they've given up.

Our matriarch bites the dust,
and this is how we move on?

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:12.483
We are not power-less.
We are powerful.

01:43:12.567 --> 01:43:15.483
If Claudia was here,
she'd say, <i>"P'alante."</i>

01:43:15.567 --> 01:43:20.983
In Puerto Rico, blackouts happen all
the time, and we still threw a fiesta.

01:43:25.942 --> 01:43:27.233
This is like

[Usnavi] How long
does this process take?

02:01:26.525 --> 02:01:29.858
[Alejandro] Well,
from the original application to court,

02:01:29.942 --> 02:01:34.483
appearances, appeals,
to a final decision...

02:01:34.567 --> 02:01:37.233
could be five months.

02:01:37.317 --> 02:01:38.983
Or five years.

02:01:39.067 --> 02:01:41.650
- [Usnavi] Five years?
- [Alejandro] Yeah.

02:01:41.733 --> 02:01:46.233
For a green card
or a rejection.

02:01:46.317 --> 02:01:49.608
See, the courts work
at their own speed.

02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:54.775
[Usnavi] Then we start today.

02:02:00.275 --> 02:02:02.275
This is worth 96,000.

02:02:02.358 --> 02:02:05.275
How much fight
does this buy us?

02:02:05.358 --> 02:02:09.275
I wanna pay for your fee,
and the rest put in a trust for Sonny.

02:02:13.150 --> 02:02:14.317
- Dude.
- It don't matter.

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:15.942
Holy shit,
that's a lot of money.

02:02:16.025 --> 02:02:18.733
- Watch your mouth, bro.
- When did you get that?

02:02:18.817 --> 02:02:20.608
What you mean, when did I get it?
Don't worry about when I got it.

02:02:20.692 --> 02:02:23.442
Why you always
asking questions?

02:02:23.525 --> 02:02:26.983
You know, payment in checks
is more common.

02:02:27.067 --> 02:02:28.983

in the morning.

02:02:29.067 --> 02:02:30.900

to cash in now.

...this is gonna be
an emotional rollercoaster.

02:02:47.650 --> 02:02:50.692
It may end in heartbreak.

02:02:50.775 --> 02:02:53.817
- But, there's a chance, right?
- Yeah.

02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:57.983
But it's my responsibility
to make sure that he knows...

02:02:59.067 --> 02:03:01.650
the odds are against you.

02:03:14.650 --> 02:03:16.942

02:03:26.775 --> 02:03:28.942

02:09:05.233 --> 02:09:07.942
walked around for a while.

02:09:08.025 --> 02:09:10.942
And then I ran into Pete.

02:09:11.025 --> 02:09:13.900
And I saw one
of his drop cloths, and...

02:09:15.733 --> 02:09:18.108
I thought that this
is my next piece.

02:09:19.817 --> 02:09:22.442
So I called Sonny and I told
him to open up the bodega,

02:09:22.525 --> 02:09:24.817
'cause my fingers
needed to move.

02:09:36.567 --> 02:09:40.233
She started working and was
like, "I need more drop cloths."

02:09:40.317 --> 02:09:41.692
So I started painting.

02:09:58.650 --> 02:10:00.442
Yo, how did you...

02:10:03.150 --> 02:10:04.942
That's my dad's beach.

02:10:05.025 --> 02:10:09.108
Yeah. You had all those photos
by the register.

02:10:09.192 --> 02:10:11.025
I worked from memory.

02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:17.108
- I did the crab in the corner.
- [laughs]

02:10:17.192 --> 02:10:18.608
What's so funny?

02:10:18.692 --> 02:10:20.358
[Graffiti Pete] Who cares
about the crab in the corner?

02:10:20.442 --> 02:10:22.358
[Sonny] What you mean,
the crab is like the best part.

02:10:22.442 --> 02:10:24.233
[Graffiti Pete] No, it is not.
It's in the corner for a reason.

02:10:24.317 --> 02:10:25.525
[Sonny] So what, are you saying
you don't like my crab?

02:10:25.608 --> 02:10:27.817
[Graffiti Pete] I may be saying
a lot of things,

02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:30.025
that just looks like
a fourth-grader drew that.

02:10:30.108 --> 02:10:31.983
- [Sonny] You could sell that.
- [Graffiti Pete] No, I cannot. For how much?

02:10:32.067 --> 02:10:34.233
