10:24.680 --> 10:26.520
<i>What, take one of my boys
off the frog case?</i>

10:26.520 --> 10:27.880

<i>She sees something when
she's halfway down Slateford Road.</i>

11:05.800 --> 11:08.320
<i>That's when she goes off camera,
that wee blind spot.</i>

11:08.320 --> 11:09.800
<i>Aye, she's definitely distracted</i>

11:09.800 --> 11:12.000
<i>by something or somebody
on Slateford Road.</i>

11:12.000 --> 11:14.040
<i>Is there any CCTV
at the bottom of Slateford</i>

11:14.040 --> 11:16.040
<i>and corner of Hailes? There.</i>

11:16.040 --> 11:18.080
<i>Not till further down.
There's a dead zone.</i>

11:18.080 --> 11:21.040
<i>Only about ten foot
until the other camera picks it up.</i>

11:21.040 --> 11:23.760
<i>So she vanished in
that ten-foot blind spot.</i>

11:26.800 --> 11:29.000
<i>Let's check the vehicles'
comings and goings.</i>

11:29.000 --> 11:30.880
<i>Especially that white van, eh?</i>

11:30.880 --> 11:33.200
<i>Maybe some of the residents
have door-bell cameras,</i>

11:39.920 --> 11:42.160
<i>What about traffic cams
on the roundabout?</i>

11:42.160 --> 11:44.960
<i>Yeah, let's just see
what the speed cameras offer up.</i>

11:44.960 --> 11:46.800
<i>We have got this
from the roundabout.</i>

11:46.800 --> 11:49.400
<i>Stop it there. Rewind a bit.</i>

11:49.400 --> 11:51.520
<i>Can we ID the plates?</i>

11:51.520 --> 11:55.960
<i>KF67 D...
I need to guess the rest.</i>

11:55.960 --> 11:58.320
<i>Run the numbers through the database

11:58.320 --> 12:00.760
<i>Go back to the lassie again.
Go back.</i>

12:03.320 --> 12:04.920
<i>Notepad.</i>

12:04.920 --> 12:07.840
<i>Let's get down there.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.640
<i>I'll keep working

<i>You OK to drive?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.320
<i>All OK?
Yeah.</i>

<i>It's just, in my experience,</i>

female officers driving.</i>

12:39.400 --> 12:43.920
<i>Yeah. I'm not keen on driving.

<i>Do you remember Claire Gorman, 16,
found dead ten years ago?</i>

13:20.680 --> 13:23.000
<i>Yeah. I was a student at the time,

13:23.000 --> 13:24.680
<i>Never caught the perp.</i>

13:24.680 --> 13:26.560
<i>Robert Ellis,

<i>of Stacey Earnshaw

<i>The Confectioner killings?
Of course.</i>

13:32.840 --> 13:35.680
<i>Claire's murder was a similar MO
to Ellis's two.</i>

13:35.680 --> 13:37.960
<i>Drugged, raped and strangled. So?</i>

13:37.960 --> 13:40.920
<i>Ellis had an alibi for Claire,
but not for Nula and Stacey,</i>

13:40.920 --> 13:42.480
<i>so he went down for them.</i>

13:42.480 --> 13:43.680
<i>He was guilty.</i>

13:43.680 --> 13:46.680
<i>He confessed after being caught
masturbating over their graves.</i>

13:46.680 --> 13:49.200
<i>And those murders stopped
after he went down.</i>

13:50.640 --> 13:53.880
<i>Why are you talking about this?
Just thinking aloud.</i>

13:56.040 --> 13:58.440

14:57.600 --> 14:58.760
<i>This is incongruous.</i>

14:58.760 --> 15:01.360
<i>Eh?</i> <i>It's out of place.
It's not where it's meant to be.</i>

15:01.360 --> 15:02.720
<i>I know what "incongruous" means.</i>

15:02.720 --> 15:05.120
<i>The point is, if something's
where it shouldn't be,</i>

15:05.120 --> 15:06.840
<i>there's a chance
it's there for a reason.</i>

15:06.840 --> 15:08.840

<i>There's no such thing.

Right.</i>

15:43.440 --> 15:45.040

15:45.040 --> 15:47.440
<i>Absolutely.
And in child abduction cases,</i>

<i>the probability points
to either the parents</i>

<i>I mean, I haven't...
It's not just a kid being snatched,</i>

in front of a member of the public.</i>

25:29.720 --> 25:31.680
<i>You wouldn't do that to
a male colleague.</i>

25:31.680 --> 25:33.000
<i>Women's rights are hardly...</i>

25:33.000 --> 25:35.560
<i>Britney has probably been rifled
by some psychopath,</i>

25:35.560 --> 25:37.360
<i>who will then fucking choke her
to death.</i>

25:37.360 --> 25:41.160
<i>THAT is women's rights being abused.
That, right there.</i>

25:41.160 --> 25:45.080
<i>Quite. That's why I'm focusing
on this case instead of cold cases.</i>

25:55.600 --> 25:59.240
<i>Amanda, I'm sorry, you were right.
I did undermine you.</i>

25:59.240 --> 26:01.280
<i>You're apologising?
Unreservedly.</i>

26:01.280 --> 26:04.320
<i>It's we men, we have this bullshit
conditioned into us</i>

26:04.320 --> 26:06.160
<i>from a very early age.</i>

26:06.160 --> 26:08.600
<i>Patriarchy is crumbling, Ray.</i>

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
<i>Let us contribute, for fuck's sake.</i>

26:10.600 --> 26:12.760
<i>I mean, I try
and dispense with the nonsense,</i>

26:12.760 --> 26:14.440
<i>but sometimes, it just...</i>

26:14.440 --> 26:16.440
<i>creeps out of me
when I'm under pressure.</i>

26:16.440 --> 26:18.320
<i>So, again, I'm sorry.</i>

26:18.320 --> 26:21.000
<i>Accepted.
Thanks.</i>

26:21.000 --> 26:23.640
<i>It's a lot of pressure,
catching paedophiles.</i>

26:23.640 --> 26:25.800
<i>The word "paedophile" is wrong.</i>

26:25.800 --> 26:28.600
<i>"Paedo" means child,
and "phile" means love.</i>

26:28.600 --> 26:31.200
<i>These beasts don't love children.
They hate children.</i>

26:31.200 --> 26:33.680
<i>It's about evil, twisted power.</i>

26:34.920 --> 26:37.640
<i>These are the kind of sick bastards
that we're up against, Amanda.</i>

26:37.640 --> 26:39.720
<i>Exhibit A.
Jesus!</i>

26:39.720 --> 26:41.720
<i>Who's that from?</i>

26:41.720 --> 26:44.680
<i>It's a minging beast that we
nicked for distributing child porn.</i>

26:46.640 --> 26:50.160
<i>Could you just pull up for me
up here, please?</i>

26:50.160 --> 26:52.120
<i>And let me out.</i>

26:52.120 --> 26:54.680
<i>Er, yeah. Sure.</i>

26:58.400 --> 26:59.880
<i>Thanks.
Are you OK?</i>

26:59.880 --> 27:01.200
<i>Yep.</i>

27:10.760 --> 27:13.840
<i>GRUNTING</i>

27:19.600 --> 27:21.120
<i>Yes!
No!</i>

27:21.120 --> 27:24.560
<i>No!
What a point! What a point!</i>

27:24.560 --> 27:26.560
<i>Well, you'll certainly add
a competitive edge</i>

27:26.560 --> 27:27.920
<i>to our management team.</i>

27:27.920 --> 27:31.800
<i>Oh, come on, you're the head of HR.
You're like the...</i>

27:31.800 --> 27:34.240
<i>trailblazer when it comes
to all that stuff.</i>

27:34.240 --> 27:37.040
<i>Oh.
Ooh.</i>

27:38.000 --> 27:39.320
<i>Ooh.</i>

27:39.320 --> 27:42.360
<i>I'm looking forward
to getting some sisterly support.</i>

27:43.640 --> 27:46.240
<i>I haven't been getting
much of that at home lately.</i>

27:46.240 --> 27:50.080
<i>I mean it, you know, I, er...</i>

27:50.080 --> 27:54.480
<i>My promotion last year was
a bit emasculating for Roddy.</i>

27:54.480 --> 27:57.240
<i>You know, some men, they just...</i>

27:57.240 --> 28:00.680
<i>they can't handle strong, powerful
women, do you know what I mean?</i>

28:00.680 --> 28:04.040
<i>Anyway, how's your new
romance going? Tell me.</i>

28:04.040 --> 28:06.280
<i>TRUDI LAUGHS
Yeah.</i>

28:06.280 --> 28:09.200
<i>Yeah, he's, er, really good.</i>

28:09.200 --> 28:11.400
<i>He's so lovely.</i>

28:11.400 --> 28:17.080
<i>He's just, er...
He's so caring, and he's attentive.</i>

28:17.080 --> 28:18.680
<i>And he's reliable.</i>

28:18.680 --> 28:21.680
<i>'He used to have a bit
of a problem with the drink,</i>

28:21.680 --> 28:23.000
<i>'but he's so over that now.</i>

28:23.000 --> 28:27.040
<i>'He's under all this stress at work,
and he copes with it so easily.'</i>

28:27.040 --> 28:29.360
<i>Hi, my name is Ray,
and I'm an addict.</i>

28:33.640 --> 28:38.280
<i>You know, I'm, er...
struggling to cope with my work, eh?</i>

28:39.560 --> 28:43.440
<i>It's literally a matter
of life and death. Yeah.</i>

28:43.440 --> 28:47.280
<i>Every day I walk into that fucking
place, it tears my soul apart.</i>

28:48.880 --> 28:53.080
<i>Every day, I deal with...
human debris.</i>

28:54.600 --> 28:57.280
<i>These are my colleagues,
people around me, my people,</i>

28:57.280 --> 29:01.440
<i>who the state employ to pursue
the real scum of this Earth.</i>

29:03.400 --> 29:07.080
<i>Clowns to the left of me,
jokers to the right.</i>

29:09.080 --> 29:10.240
<i>And...</i>

29:11.480 --> 29:13.320
<i>And all I want is oblivion.</i>

29:14.480 --> 29:15.920
<i>All I want is oblivion.</i>

29:15.920 --> 29:18.680
<i>Every cell in my body
just craves it.</i>

29:18.680 --> 29:22.240
<i>I wanna... I wanna drink
this fucking city dry.</i>

29:22.240 --> 29:26.160
<i>I want to snort the entire
rainforest of South fucking America,</i>

29:26.160 --> 29:28.480
<i>and I just want to...
HE SCREAMS</i>

29:30.120 --> 29:32.200
<i>..tear this fucking place apart.</i>

29:32.200 --> 29:35.440
<i>And I don't know how
to stop and I just... I just...</i>

29:35.440 --> 29:38.160
<i>'Well, that sounds as if you're
onto a winner with him, doesn't it?'</i>

29:39.240 --> 29:41.680
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

30:01.760 --> 30:05.400
<i>Listen!
Gill's got something for us.</i>

30:05.400 --> 30:06.640
<i>Go ahead, Gill.</i>

30:06.640 --> 30:09.640
<i>Britney's grandfather,
Ronnie Hamil, has vanished.</i>

30:09.640 --> 30:12.800
<i>Last seen in the Royal Oak
the night before her disappearance.</i>

30:12.800 --> 30:14.320
<i>This could be significant.</i>

30:14.320 --> 30:16.160
<i>He's not at home,
and his phone's off.</i>

30:16.160 --> 30:18.160
<i>The pub landlord last saw him
on Wednesday night,</i>

30:18.160 --> 30:20.880
<i>which is unusual.
Ronnie Hamil's got previous.</i>

30:20.880 --> 30:22.640
<i>Not for anything like this,
though, boss.</i>

30:22.640 --> 30:24.480
<i>That arsehole Angela's shagging.</i>

30:24.480 --> 30:26.120
<i>You mean the school sports
boyfriend?</i>

30:27.320 --> 30:28.640
<i>Aye.</i>

30:28.640 --> 30:32.320
<i>It's a guy that the, erm, headmaster
said she stepped out with.</i>

30:32.320 --> 30:33.960
<i>Well, let's find him.</i>

30:33.960 --> 30:35.760
<i>But Ronnie Hamil's
the main priority.</i>

30:35.760 --> 30:38.200
<i>I'm just saying that
the only previous that Ronnie's got</i>

30:38.200 --> 30:41.000
<i>is for shoplifting
and drunk and disorderly.</i>

30:41.000 --> 30:42.640
<i>He could be involved, though, Ray.</i>

30:42.640 --> 30:44.640
<i>The laws of probability
are at play here.</i>

30:44.640 --> 30:46.040
<i>I think it's highly unlikely.</i>

30:46.040 --> 30:49.800
<i>Well, we haven't got much in the way
of "highly likely" right now.</i>

30:49.800 --> 30:51.320
<i>So, let's split the team up.</i>

30:51.320 --> 30:54.720
<i>You carry on as normal, Ray.
You find Ronnie Hamil.</i>

30:54.720 --> 30:57.040
<i>Dougie, what's
that yellow piece of paper?</i>

30:57.040 --> 31:00.560
<i>Oh, we found it
at the froggy expiry on her desk.</i>

31:00.560 --> 31:02.680
<i>It's a bit of paper
with a number on it.</i>

31:02.680 --> 31:03.920
<i>3720.</i>

31:03.920 --> 31:05.040
<i>Can I get a look?
Aye.</i>

31:05.040 --> 31:07.040
<i>Fuck off!</i>

31:07.040 --> 31:09.120
<i>Ray?</i>

31:09.120 --> 31:10.920
<i>My office, please, a word.</i>

31:22.440 --> 31:24.440
<i>We need a press release.</i>

31:24.440 --> 31:26.840
<i>Some lassie at the school
has just tweeted</i>

31:26.840 --> 31:29.080
<i>that her friend Britney's
gone missing.</i>

31:29.080 --> 31:32.040
<i>Ian Hoy at the news
has got hold of it.</i>

31:32.040 --> 31:35.960
<i>He's gonna tip off STV and BBC
Scotland if we don't play ball.</i>

31:35.960 --> 31:38.080
<i>Well, I think it's good to get it
out to the public.</i>

31:38.080 --> 31:39.840
<i>Maybe they can help us
find Ronnie Hamil.</i>

31:39.840 --> 31:42.760
<i>Listen... Ha!
..I smell nonce off that jakeball,</i>

31:42.760 --> 31:45.000
<i>but there's no way
that he snatched Britney.</i>

31:45.000 --> 31:47.720
<i>Six minutes to secure her,
get her in the van and speed off?</i>

31:47.720 --> 31:50.680
<i>But he went missing at the same time
as his granddaughter.</i>

31:50.680 --> 31:53.120
<i>Come on!</i> <i>I doubt he's even got
a driving licence.</i>

31:53.120 --> 31:55.280
<i>Who's to say he was acting alone?</i>

31:55.280 --> 31:57.840
<i>Aye.</i> <i>You're saying you smell
short-eyes off him, right?</i>

31:57.840 --> 32:01.200
<i>Well, who's he's been noncing?
Britney, Tessa.</i>

32:01.200 --> 32:04.440
<i>Probably Angela before that.
You say she's a bed-wetter.</i>

32:04.440 --> 32:06.720
<i>13 years old, pissing the bed.</i>

32:06.720 --> 32:09.440
<i>'Some creep's been
freaking this kid out.</i>

32:09.440 --> 32:10.520
<i>'Who's her bogeyman?'</i>

32:17.680 --> 32:19.440
<i>BIRDSONG</i>

32:32.440 --> 32:35.000
<i>'Perhaps indicating a struggle.</i>

32:35.000 --> 32:38.240
<i>'Perhaps it was placed there by some
fucking serial fucking killer!'</i>

32:38.240 --> 32:40.840
<i>That's what I'm fucking saying!
That's what I'm fucking saying!</i>

32:40.840 --> 32:42.920
<i>He fixed her, the fucking nonce!
The nonce!</i>

32:42.920 --> 32:44.760
<i>Ray?</i>

32:46.400 --> 32:49.520
<i>Listen. I spotted this.</i>

32:49.520 --> 32:51.360
<i>Piece of yellow notepaper.</i>

32:51.360 --> 32:54.320
<i>It's, er...
It's a piece of common notepad.</i>

32:54.320 --> 32:56.520
<i>But maybe it flew out
of a notepad.</i>

32:56.520 --> 32:59.280
<i>Perhaps as a result of the struggle.
Maybe it was placed there.</i>

32:59.280 --> 33:00.760
<i>No!
Maybe it was placed there.</i>

33:00.760 --> 33:02.280
<i>No, no. Ray, for God's sake.</i>

33:02.280 --> 33:04.280
<i>Haul in your missing suspects</i>

33:04.280 --> 33:07.760
<i>before you go fixating
on a piece of fucking paper.</i>

33:08.800 --> 33:15.280
<i>Right. The white van sped off at
the same time as Britney vanished.</i>

33:15.280 --> 33:18.360
<i>The piece of paper wasnae there
until after the white van sped off.</i>

33:18.360 --> 33:20.320
<i>Have a look at the CCTV.
Have a look at it!</i>

33:20.320 --> 33:23.800
<i>CCTV? What does it mean?</i>

33:23.800 --> 33:27.560
<i>The piece of paper could have
blown in onto the scene.</i>

33:27.560 --> 33:31.320
<i>Just find Ronnie Hamil.
And the boyfriend.</i>

33:31.320 --> 33:33.560
<i>Sweat the fucking name out of her!</i>

33:36.720 --> 33:38.240
<i>Her daughter's missing.</i>

33:38.240 --> 33:39.960
<i>Why would she not be
straight with us?</i>

33:39.960 --> 33:41.920
<i>Everyone's got secrets.</i>

33:43.920 --> 33:46.440
<i>And why are you holding back
on the school sports boyfriend?</i>

33:46.440 --> 33:48.080
<i>Because we don't know anything yet.</i>

33:48.080 --> 33:50.000
<i>Boss has a hard-on
for Ronnie fucking Hamil.</i>

33:50.000 --> 33:51.560
<i>MOBILE PINGS
And you don't?</i>

33:52.800 --> 33:55.840
<i>Ray? Ray?</i>

33:55.840 --> 33:57.800
<i>I'm just thinking through stuff.</i>

33:57.800 --> 33:59.760
<i>HE SIGHS
It's gonna be a long day.</i>

33:59.760 --> 34:02.320
<i>You OK with how we're working
so far?</i>

34:02.320 --> 34:05.560
<i>Yeah. The mansplaining irritates me
a bit, though.</i>

34:07.240 --> 34:10.720
<i>The need to patronisingly
explain every single thing</i>

34:10.720 --> 34:13.120
<i>in that voice.</i>

34:14.920 --> 34:16.760
<i>And what voice
would that be, Amanda?</i>

34:16.760 --> 34:19.040
<i>HE LAUGHS</i>

34:20.200 --> 34:22.880
<i>Seriously, Ray. You wouldn't talk
to Ginger like that.</i>

34:22.880 --> 34:25.720
<i>No, you're right.</i> <i>Just talk to me
like you talk to him.</i>

34:25.720 --> 34:27.800
<i>Right, then,
you fat, tight-arsed bastard,</i>

34:27.800 --> 34:29.440
<i>your shout at the boozer.</i>

34:29.440 --> 34:31.240
<i>THEY CHUCKLE</i>

34:34.840 --> 34:37.680
<i>'Where's your dad, Angela?
Why didn't you mention him before?'</i>

34:37.680 --> 34:39.960
<i>I told them, I don't know
where he could have gone.</i>

34:39.960 --> 34:42.160
<i>I don't know what he does.
Not seen him in years.</i>

34:42.160 --> 34:44.800
<i>You lied about the boyfriend, too,
didn't you?</i> <i>No!</i>

34:44.800 --> 34:46.320
<i>The school sports, Angela!</i>

34:46.320 --> 34:48.560
<i>Who was the guy you were
at the school sports with?</i> <i>Ray!</i>

34:48.560 --> 34:50.320
<i>You don't understand,
it's not like that.</i>

34:50.320 --> 34:53.040
<i>Name and phone number.
We do not have time to piss about!</i>

34:54.200 --> 34:57.560
<i>Graham Cornell.</i> <i>Graham Cornell.
Right, tell me about him.</i>

34:57.560 --> 35:01.160
<i>Why?
Because he might know something.</i>

<i>It wouldnae. It wouldnae be him!</i>

35:03.720 --> 35:06.360
<i>Angela.
Graham's a friend.</i>

35:06.360 --> 35:08.000
<i>Works at the offices I clean.</i>

35:08.000 --> 35:11.560
<i>Nah, Graham wouldnae.
And anyway, he's gay.</i>

35:11.560 --> 35:13.720
<i>Did you ever
talk about the girls with him?</i>

35:13.720 --> 35:15.560
<i>The girls?
Aye.</i>

35:15.560 --> 35:17.480
<i>I don't...</i>

35:17.480 --> 35:19.280
<i>We just go for drinks. He's no...</i>

35:19.280 --> 35:22.440
<i>When did you last hear from him?
Erm...</i>

35:22.440 --> 35:24.320
<i>A while ago.</i>

35:25.760 --> 35:29.640
<i>He goes away a lot.

<i>Hi, Gill. Thanks.</i>

35:34.760 --> 35:38.280
<i>Good to know.
HORN TOOTS</i>

35:38.280 --> 35:40.480
<i>Guess who's taken
two weeks' annual leave</i>

35:40.480 --> 35:42.760
<i>without telling a fucking soul
where he's gone, eh?</i>

35:42.760 --> 35:44.880
<i>Cornell.
Something's not right.</i>

35:44.880 --> 35:47.960
<i>How can all our prime suspects
disappear at the same fucking time?</i>

35:47.960 --> 35:51.120
<i>There are a lot of people
vanishing around this case.</i>

36:09.000 --> 36:11.080
<i>Wonder who she's going
to see now, then?</i>

36:11.080 --> 36:13.720
<i>Graham Cornell? Follow that taxi.</i>

36:13.720 --> 36:15.440
<i>I've always wanted to say that.</i>

36:37.280 --> 36:38.760
<i>It was a win-win.</i>

36:38.760 --> 36:41.880
<i>If we broke her down, she'd tell us
where her dad or Cornell was.</i>

36:41.880 --> 36:44.560
<i>If not, she'd lead us to him,
as she's doing now.</i>

36:50.120 --> 36:52.200
<i>Hang on, where's she going now?</i>

37:12.160 --> 37:15.440
<i>Why's she protecting him?
It's her daughter.</i>

<i>Where is she?! Where's my bairn?!
Ow!</i>

37:38.880 --> 37:42.160
<i>You're trying to nonce her like you
did me, you filthy old bastard!</i>

37:42.160 --> 37:44.120
<i>No, Angela!
Ow!</i>
