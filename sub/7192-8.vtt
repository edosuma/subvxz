<i>EMMA: Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Every Witch Way...

00:03.169 --> 00:04.462
- Something weird
is definitely going on.

00:04.546 --> 00:07.590
- You don't remember Miami
or your friends in there.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.425
- How do you know that?

00:08.508 --> 00:10.260
- I know
I can help you remember.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.137
- The chef made it
especially for you.

00:15.348 --> 00:18.309
- I remember.
I remember everything.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.061
- It was that girl's food.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.771
- He really remembers!

00:21.855 --> 00:25.066
- I can't believe I could've
ever forgotten about you.

00:25.150 --> 00:25.942
- Whoa!

00:26.025 --> 00:27.485
- I went to Daniel's house,

00:27.569 --> 00:29.362
and his family wasn't there.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.739
- But he remembered!

00:30.822 --> 00:32.156
- Sorry, but the Continuum Break
is still in effect.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.247
Ah.

00:44.502 --> 00:47.005
Aah!

00:47.088 --> 00:49.799
[whispering] Uh, what were you
doing in Dad's bathroom?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.926
- [whispering] Not cutting
my bangs with his nail scissors.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.178
What are you doing
in his dresser?

00:53.261 --> 00:54.304
- Um...

00:54.387 --> 00:56.473
Dad asked me to check if...

00:56.556 --> 00:58.892
his drawers
are sliding properly.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.021
- Uh-huh.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.980
Not looking
for anything about me?

01:05.063 --> 01:06.191
- Definitely not.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.442
- [normal voice]
Then why are we whispering?

01:07.525 --> 01:09.486
- Um...
- So you want me to be lookout

01:09.569 --> 01:10.820
while you snoop around.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.071
Okay, we'll need a signal
in case Dad comes.

01:12.155 --> 01:15.950
How about...
"caw-caw, caw-caw"?

01:16.034 --> 01:18.203
- What is it gonna take
for you to leave me alone?

01:18.286 --> 01:20.622
Is it more presents?
Is that what it'll take?

01:20.705 --> 01:21.623
How about a puppy?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.625
- No, I don't--

01:23.708 --> 01:24.584
Wait.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.461
A real puppy?

01:29.839 --> 01:31.800
Aw, he's so...

01:31.883 --> 01:34.677
No, I don't want
any more presents, Jax.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.055
I want a brother.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.973
- Well, you've only been around
for a couple days,

01:39.057 --> 01:41.434
and I'm already
getting the sense

01:41.518 --> 01:44.646
that Daddy's little girl
isn't exactly on Team Jax.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.647
- Why does there need
to be teams?

01:45.730 --> 01:46.815
We're a family.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.567
- Aw, the Novoas--

01:49.651 --> 01:51.444
one big happy family,
just the three of us.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.363
Right.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.864
- Actually, the four of us.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.157
- Oh, did you hear that, buddy?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.826
You're already
a part of the family.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.036
- No.
Not the puppy.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.372
If this isn't enough to prove

02:02.455 --> 02:03.832
that I'm on the same
side as you,

02:03.915 --> 02:05.375
I don't know what is.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.460
Jax...

02:07.544 --> 02:09.044
Mom is alive.

{\an8}Jessie, I need to see you.

02:49.794 --> 02:50.378
{\an8}Can you come with me, please?

02:54.799 --> 02:55.842
- Where did you and I meet?

02:55.925 --> 02:57.510
- At my house.
- Yes!

02:57.594 --> 02:59.637
- In the Everglades.
- No!

02:59.721 --> 03:01.890
So you live in the Everglades?

03:01.973 --> 03:02.974
- Yeah.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.810
But I also live here in Miami.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.978
- Whoa.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.063
As if this
weren't complicated enough.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.608
- It's like I have both lives
that are real.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.444
I take care of wounded animals,
and I'm a lifeguard.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.905
I love burgers,
but I'm a vegetarian.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.948
- Who doesn't love burgers?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.867
- It's making me kind of woozy.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.535
I'm gonna get
a drink of water.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.788
- What is going on?

03:25.872 --> 03:27.749
He thinks Maddie
and him are dating.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.168
- Oh, please,
as if he's my type.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.794
- He <i> is</i> your type.

03:31.878 --> 03:32.795
Was your type.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.505
Sorry, Diego.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.798
You two used to be a couple.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.634
- Uh, yeah, okay.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.969
Now you're just creating
a fantasy backstory.

03:40.053 --> 03:40.970
- He remembers his life,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.806
just not...all of it.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.724
- Well, we need
to straighten him out

03:44.807 --> 03:45.975
on what's going on, right now.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.143
- No!

03:47.226 --> 03:49.354
I mean, we have to play along.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.980
BOTH: What?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.024
- He only has pieces
of his memory back.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.276
We can't be sure
what he knows and doesn't know.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.819
- Oh, but he remembers
dating my girlfriend.

03:56.903 --> 03:57.654
Just great.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.530
- This is a fragile situation.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.990
A few returned memories
won't stop the break.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.159
He needs his whole life back,

04:03.242 --> 04:07.330
or we could lose him forever.

04:07.413 --> 04:07.997
- There's a spell that restores
lost memories, but--

04:08.081 --> 04:09.415
- No, there's not.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.376
I've spent the last three days
searching the Hex,

04:11.459 --> 04:13.753
and there's not
anything like that.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.004
- Do you want to be right,

04:15.088 --> 04:16.964
or do you want to fix
some minds?

04:17.839 --> 04:19.216
- Go on.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.802
- You can only restore
a half hour at a time.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.387
I used it on--

04:23.763 --> 04:27.016
I was <i> gonna</i> use it on Gigi.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.184
But I would never do that.
- Mm-hmm.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.061
- A half hour
doesn't really help us.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.814
- It can be accelerated,
though.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.024
I just, uh...

04:35.108 --> 04:36.192
can't do it.

04:36.275 --> 04:37.235
- Why not?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.361
- Because
I'm not powerful enough.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.696
- I'm sorry.
Say that again.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.197
- Because I'm not
powerful enough, okay?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.116
We can't all be
the Chosen One.

04:43.199 --> 04:43.908
- I'll look into it.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.078
In the meantime, play along.

04:47.161 --> 04:47.996
Please?

04:48.079 --> 04:50.039
We only have one more day.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.332
BOTH: Fine.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.584
- So I guess
I'm his girlfriend.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.336
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, no.
I don't agree with that.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.547
- His fake girlfriend.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.298
- Right.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.597
- So Diego's cool with you
dating rando Daniel?

05:06.681 --> 05:08.433
- I'm not dating rando Daniel.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.435
I'm fake dating rando Daniel.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.563
- I hope one day I can meet
someone to fake date.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.732
It's so fake romantic.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.067
- So...

05:18.151 --> 05:21.988
As long as I have to do this
and I can't be with Proxy,

05:22.071 --> 05:24.115
I want to let him know
I still care

05:24.198 --> 05:25.700
and do something
nice for him.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.535
- I have an idea!

05:27.618 --> 05:28.369
- Oh!

05:32.832 --> 05:33.875
- [scoffs]
How about a list?

05:33.958 --> 05:34.917
- I love lists!

05:35.001 --> 05:36.085
Did you see

05:36.169 --> 05:37.003
the Top 10 Hottest Hairstyles
For This Season?

05:37.086 --> 05:40.089
Two words--"man bun"!

05:40.173 --> 05:42.050
- I meant we should
make a list

05:42.133 --> 05:43.593
of things Diego likes.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.304
- Obvi.
I mean, I knew that.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.305
[sighs]

05:47.388 --> 05:48.973
No need to write
nor move my wrists.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.475
Now come alive
to create this list.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.692
Easy, Sophie.
You scared me.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.903
- I found extra brain power!

06:01.986 --> 06:03.780
Oh, no!

06:03.863 --> 06:06.240
Not again!

06:06.324 --> 06:07.575
[sighs]

06:07.658 --> 06:09.535
- [chuckles] So you think
you're a Shark now?

06:09.619 --> 06:13.498
- He <i> is</i> a Shark--
the captain of the Sharks.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.958
- No, we--we've been
over this already.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.752
Sophie is the captain
of the Sharks.

06:17.835 --> 06:22.465
- Once you see him swim,
you'll know he's a Shark.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.427
- No, he's not.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.222
- Yes, he is.

06:29.972 --> 06:33.142
- Aah!

06:38.397 --> 06:39.857
- Any progress
with Maddie's spell?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.110
- Some, but there's a chance
it could get messed up,

06:42.193 --> 06:43.277
and I'd have no time to fix it.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.320
- I just helped Daniel plan

06:44.403 --> 06:47.115
a romantic date
with my girlfriend

06:47.198 --> 06:48.449
to maybe help him
with his memory

06:48.533 --> 06:50.159
so that he doesn't disappear.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.788
- Man, we have officially
entered telenovela territory.

06:53.871 --> 06:54.413
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

06:54.497 --> 06:55.081
- He's confused.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.041
He remembers two lives,

06:57.125 --> 06:57.875
but there are gaps
in one of them.

06:57.959 --> 06:58.876
- Yeah, but he also remembers

06:58.960 --> 07:00.419
that he has
another girlfriend, too,

07:00.503 --> 07:02.046
but does that stop him
from dating Maddie?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.131
No.

07:04.799 --> 07:05.842
I'm fine with it.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.052
- We need to figure out
where the gaps are

07:08.136 --> 07:09.428
and fill in the blanks.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.347
- Oh, great idea! Yeah!

07:11.430 --> 07:13.182
Just one small problem--
we don't remember him.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.351
- Want to be my guinea pigs?

07:15.434 --> 07:18.312
- The jacked-up memory spell?

07:19.313 --> 07:20.773
- I'm allergic to guinea pigs.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.400
But if it means the end
of Daniel and Maddie,

07:22.483 --> 07:23.442
pssh, I'm in.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.403
- [breathes deeply]

07:25.486 --> 07:27.363
Daniel's friends
should know him,

07:27.446 --> 07:28.739
but their memories are dim.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.324
So shed some light
on the situation

07:30.408 --> 07:32.451
and restore
their memories of him.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.914
- Uh...

07:36.998 --> 07:38.541
what were we
just talking about?

07:38.624 --> 07:40.334
- The first time
Daniel and I met...

07:40.418 --> 07:41.627
outside my house.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.962
You were with me.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.881
- Oh--oh, the garbage can.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.799
Yeah, yeah,
and Mac's stinky sock.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.343
- Aw, I miss Mac's socks.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.429
Such a gnarly assault
to the senses.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.763
- Yeah, and the butterflies--

07:52.847 --> 07:54.223
Daniel was all...

07:54.307 --> 07:56.726
- [laughing]

07:56.809 --> 07:58.436
- That was classic Daniel.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.230
- Should I get Diego?
- No.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.608
[whispering] I'm gonna have
to do a memory wipe.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.026
There's no other choice.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.862
- Is that some kind
of superhero slang?

08:07.945 --> 08:09.071
I should take notes.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.074
"Mem-o-ry wipe."
Definition?

08:12.158 --> 08:15.912
- Gigi, just close your eyes.
You've been through this before.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.371
- I have?
I don't remember.

08:17.455 --> 08:21.292
And a memory wipe sounds like
something I would remember.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.586
Oh, wait.

him from remembering me.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.198

coming back in order,

10:16.282 --> 10:17.742

that far yet,

10:17.825 --> 10:19.243

for him to remember,

18:02.581 --> 18:05.334
- Hey, everyone.
I'm...

18:05.417 --> 18:06.627
I'm...

18:06.710 --> 18:07.753
- Gigi.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.756
- Sure!
Can I...

18:10.839 --> 18:11.757
[chuckles]
Wait.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.717
What am I doing here?

18:13.801 --> 18:15.010
- Taking our order?

18:15.093 --> 18:16.428
- [chuckles]
- Oh...

18:16.512 --> 18:18.680
right.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.183
- What is wrong with her?

18:23.602 --> 18:24.937
- Look, the couple's special.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.356
That sound good to you, babe?

18:29.858 --> 18:32.319
- Proxy! No!

18:39.785 --> 18:40.327
[tablet beeping]

18:45.332 --> 18:49.294
- I'm gonna go check out
that cake situation.

18:49.378 --> 18:49.837
Who's in?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.047
- Chocolate?

18:52.130 --> 18:53.715
- No, thanks.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.175
Hurry back.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.724
- I'm going to see her.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.059
- Mom?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.144
All right, let's do this.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.398
What was that for?

19:09.481 --> 19:10.482
- Not now.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.734
Tomorrow morning
when nobody's awake.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.278
And besides,
I can't take you.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.696
You need to stay here
and occupy Dad.

19:15.779 --> 19:16.905
- So unfair.

19:16.989 --> 19:17.948
- Well, hang on.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.492
Everybody on the team
has a job to do.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.995
And yours is to
hold the fort down,

19:23.078 --> 19:25.581
and to give me
Mom's address.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.124
- She lives in Hollywood.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.375
- California.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.670
- No!
Hollywood, Florida!

19:31.753 --> 19:32.296
I'll text it to you.
- Wait!

19:34.298 --> 19:35.424
You forgetting something?

19:35.507 --> 19:38.260
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.303
Not that.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.017
[laughing]

19:45.100 --> 19:47.102
- I'm glad
we're on the same team.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.480
- Me too.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.859
- Did I miss anything?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.110
- [scoffs]
From the sounds of it,

19:55.193 --> 19:58.071
only the most awkward
date ever.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.449
- What is wrong with me?
I'm not the jealous type.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.327
I had to offer
a couple's special tonight.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.662
- Proxy, it's not your fault.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.789
I should have never
agreed to this.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.750
[sighs]
I'm calling this off.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.085
- No, you can't!

20:12.169 --> 20:14.087
I have to be the one
to break you two up.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.380
We have to re-create
the events

20:15.464 --> 20:16.882
as closely to how
it actually happened.

20:16.965 --> 20:19.760
- I can't stay in this fake
relationship any longer.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.219
- You don't get it.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.722
If we alter his timeline,
he might never remember me.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.682
- And...

20:25.766 --> 20:26.600
he could disappear.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.601
- Right.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.145
- Ugh, this is such
a nightmare.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.314
If it wasn't so dangerous
to do it to myself,

20:32.397 --> 20:35.275
I'd memory wipe my own mind
and forget this whole thing.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.818
- It's not that dangerous,

20:36.902 --> 20:38.487
at least that's what
you said when you did it

20:38.570 --> 20:40.530
to Gigi at school today.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.074
- You mean
at The Seven yesterday.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.826
- Yeah.
That's what she meant.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.203
Uh, you know, Sophie gets

20:46.286 --> 20:49.748
The Seven and the school
mixed up sometimes.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.000
Just like, um...

20:52.084 --> 20:52.793
- Maddie?

20:52.876 --> 20:55.796
- I had to do it!

20:55.879 --> 20:58.173
She walked in on me
casting <i> another</i> spell.

20:58.256 --> 21:01.176
- That's why she was acting
so weird at the table before.

21:01.259 --> 21:02.886
Would you stop
casting spells at school?

21:02.970 --> 21:04.638
- It was for a good reason!

21:05.180 --> 21:07.557
- Which was?

21:07.641 --> 21:10.310
Huh?
- I'm still working on it.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.896
Can't tell you yet.
