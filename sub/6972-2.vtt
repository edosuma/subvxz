WEBVTT

00:04.671 --> 00:08.383
We interrupt this program
for a breaking news bulletin.

00:08.383 --> 00:11.178
90 miles and counting--
that's how far officers--

00:11.178 --> 00:15.182
of the Nevada highway patrol have pursued
the blue car on your screen.

00:15.390 --> 00:21.271
In a wild chase right through the heart of Elko
at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.359
Live on the scene in Carlin is
Chuck Pickering in the Fox 11 news chopper.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.486
Chuck, what can you tell us?

00:27.486 --> 00:32.533
Benjamin, we're heading west following
route 766, where it feeds off the I-80.

00:32.573 --> 00:36.578
Now, just under an hour ago, troopers
attempted to pull over the blue car--

00:37.079 --> 00:38.872
which we understand is stolen.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.083
That occurred on the 80, east of Wells.

00:41.083 --> 00:44.795
Now, since then, this driver
has stopped for nothing and nobody.

00:44.795 --> 00:47.381
Any word yet on who the driver is?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.590
None at this time.

00:48.590 --> 00:52.386
What we do think, though and what
we've passed on to the Highway Patrol--

00:52.386 --> 00:55.973
is that from our vantage point
we've seen another person in that car.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.475
See, right there.
A hand.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.978
It just moved.
See, in the back seat?

01:00.978 --> 01:04.272
Now, we could possibly
have a hostage situation here.

01:04.272 --> 01:08.277
And, obviously, the sooner
they bring this vehicle to a stop...

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

01:35.470 --> 01:39.183
Unit six, ready at milepost 13.

01:39.183 --> 01:43.187
Coming your way, six.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.170
Well, that did the trick.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.965
The automobile seems to be coming to a stop.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.592
Chuck, what did they just use there?

02:13.592 --> 02:16.762
It looked to be
a special tire-puncturing chain.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.389
And now the officers
are approaching the car.

02:19.389 --> 02:23.393
One of them has opened the door,
and he has hold of the suspect.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.397
He's pulling him out.
He doesn't seem to have a weapon.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.359
He may not be armed
but from our vantage point,

02:30.359 --> 02:31.693
it looks like he doesn't
want to get out of that car.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.571
Vicky!
Vicky!

02:34.571 --> 02:37.282
Please get it out of my head.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.160
Vicky! Vicky!
No! Let me go!

02:40.160 --> 02:42.788
Let me go! Vicky!
No! Let me go!

02:42.788 --> 02:48.544
I got to go!
Vicky! No!

02:48.585 --> 02:51.964
...Hostage appears to be okay.
The Highway Patrol has her now.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.383
But Chuck, it looks like
that driver is still fighting.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.468
Yes.
He's definitely putting up a bit of a fight.

02:56.468 --> 03:00.931
He seems to be a man with a few choice
words on the subject as you can see.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.766
They're trying to restrain him.
I tell you what.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.560
We're going to move back
and try to get a wider angle.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.270
See, there's the woman...

03:06.270 --> 03:07.980
What the hell?
She's...

03:07.980 --> 03:11.984
Vicky! Vicky!

03:14.278 --> 03:16.196
There, see?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.990
She's banging her head
against the window.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.994
- What the hell just happened?
- CUT! CUT! CUT!

04:02.284 --> 04:03.869
Yeah?

04:03.869 --> 04:06.496
Uh, Virgil Nokes?
I'm Agent Scully.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.459
This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the F.B.I.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.586
Jehovah's Witness?

04:12.586 --> 04:15.589
No, sir.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.593
But we do have a free copy
of "The Watchtower" for you if you'd like.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.388
Uh, sir, this is just
a routine check but, uh,

04:23.388 --> 04:24.973
we understand that
you recently placedan order for...

04:24.973 --> 04:28.769
5,000 pounds of ammonium
nitrate fertilizer.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.773
Oh, you people.
Come on in.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.197
- Sugar beets.
- Excuse me?

04:40.197 --> 04:43.200
I grow sugar beets.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.161
I figure I got better things
to do with my fertilizer than going...

04:46.161 --> 04:49.164
around blowing government
buildings sky high.

04:49.164 --> 04:52.793
Yeah. Well, as we said,
sir this is just routine.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.797
So routine, it numbs the mind.

04:57.381 --> 05:01.385
I got my AG card and my papers
'round here somewhere.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.762
Help me look for them, will you?

05:03.762 --> 05:06.098
...As we reported earlier
a wild police pursuit...

05:06.098 --> 05:10.060
ended in tragedy this morning with the death
of a 36-year-old female hostage.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.189
This was the scene west of Elko,
Nevada, one hour ago...

05:14.189 --> 05:18.193
- Hey, Scully, take a look at this.
- ...died mysteriously while in custody.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.989
We once again want to warn our viewers
this footage is extremely graphic.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.575
Now the hostage is still inside the car.

05:24.575 --> 05:28.579
It appears that she is banging
her head against the window...

05:28.787 --> 05:31.081
At this time, highway patrol
officials are refusing...

05:31.081 --> 05:34.376
to identify the woman
or to speculate on how she died.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.962
Though they do stress it was
not the result of a gunshot.

05:36.962 --> 05:40.382
A preliminary Coroner's report
is not expected for a day or more.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.260
Meanwhile residents of
Northern Nevada who first witnessed...

05:48.265 --> 05:52.269
Thank you, Captain. That's no problem.
We'd be happy to help.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.563
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll be happy to help what?

05:54.563 --> 05:55.981
See you soon.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.691
Mulder, we're not going to Nevada.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.568
Come on, Scully.
Just one quick side trip.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.570
No. Sorry, Mulder.
We have a whole new assignment.

06:01.570 --> 06:05.073
Running down people that buy fertilizer?
This is scut work, bozo work--

06:05.073 --> 06:07.993
This is the F.B.I. equivalent of being made
to wear an orange jumpsuit...

06:07.993 --> 06:11.997
and pick up trash by the side
of the highway-- they mean to humiliate us.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.584
Look, Mulder, like it or not,
humiliated or not,

06:15.584 --> 06:18.378
we're on domestic
terrorism now and, yes, this is...

06:18.378 --> 06:20.297
This is a punishment...

06:20.297 --> 06:23.175
but if we want to get back to where
we want to be we have to follow orders.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.676
We can't freelance.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.095
You saw that news report.
What did you make of that?

06:27.095 --> 06:29.598
I think that the obvious assumption
is that the woman was shot,

06:29.598 --> 06:32.392
regardless of what the police say.
Maybe it was a sniper.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.395
In the words of their captain
"she just sort of popped."

06:35.395 --> 06:38.565
And what about this guy who supposedly
tried to take her hostage, her husband?

06:38.565 --> 06:42.569
Looked to me like he was trying to warn the cops before she died.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.989
Now, the sun will rise
in America tomorrow regardless of whether...

06:45.989 --> 06:49.993
or not we're at yet another farm investigating
yet another enormous pile of doo-doo.

06:52.287 --> 06:56.291
We can be in and out in a day.
Nobody has to know.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.585
S-s-somebody!

07:39.585 --> 07:40.961
Please!

07:40.961 --> 07:43.797
It's starting!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.174
Somebody!

07:45.174 --> 07:46.383
Why can't we see him?

07:46.383 --> 07:49.970
Well, hopefully later.
He pitched quite a fit in his cell--

07:49.970 --> 07:53.682
screaming a bunch of nonsense that we were
going to kill him the way we killed his wife.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.685
You know, he's not
a particularly stable individual.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.395
Captain, he may need medical attention.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.982
He's getting it.
Our doctor's with him now.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.068
I mean, after whatever
happened to his wife--

08:05.068 --> 08:08.363
which I'd like to stress was not our fault--

08:08.363 --> 08:10.574
we're not going
to take any chances, you know?

08:10.574 --> 08:13.994
Patrick Garland Crump of Montello, Nevada.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.998
40-year-old roofer.
No history of mental illness.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.459
No prior record.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.169
He's got one now.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.172
That Barracuda he jacked
on the Utah state line?

08:25.172 --> 08:29.176
He yanked some teenager out of
the window threw his wife in back and took off.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.679
Excuse me.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.765
What do you think?

08:35.765 --> 08:39.561
I'm thinking while we're here
I might take a look at Mr. Crump's wife.

08:39.561 --> 08:43.565
I'm going to stay here
and see if I can see Crump.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.581
Captain, where's Montello?

08:59.581 --> 09:01.792
Little town right here.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.962
So that's where it started.
That's Crump's home.

09:04.962 --> 09:08.465
Then he headed east in this direction...

09:08.465 --> 09:12.177
on the 5 about ten miles
to the Utah border where he stole the car.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.762
You got it.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.599
Yeah, but you caught up
with him in Wells. Where's that?

09:17.599 --> 09:19.476
- That's here.
- So that means that he started...

09:19.476 --> 09:23.480
off in this direction. Then all of a sudden,
he turned around and he headed west...

09:23.564 --> 09:27.568
To Wells. Why?

09:31.196 --> 09:35.075
The former Vicky Jenkins Crump.

09:35.075 --> 09:39.079
I'm hoping you can tell me what I'm
looking at 'cause this is a new one on me.

09:54.761 --> 09:58.265
There's no gunpowder residue...

09:58.265 --> 10:02.269
No carbon stippling.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.774
There seems to be no evidence
of an entry wound whatsoever.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.778
There is none.
It's all exit, but how that could be...?

10:22.581 --> 10:24.958
I'm finding what look like fragments
of petrous bone embedded...

10:24.958 --> 10:28.587
in the remaining portion of the auditory canal.

10:28.587 --> 10:32.591
In fact, I seem to be looking straight through
to the osseous labyrinth or what's left of it.

10:32.591 --> 10:36.595
It's almost like a little bomb
went off in her ear.

10:40.182 --> 10:44.186
- May I?
- Please.

10:50.776 --> 10:54.780
There seems to be some kind
of tumefaction within the lateral sinus.

11:13.090 --> 11:17.094
Patient is a white male,
age 40, no known history...

11:18.387 --> 11:20.389
No, he just went rammy on me.

11:20.389 --> 11:23.392
Accucheck is normal.
We did a narcan push...

11:23.392 --> 11:26.979
but he keeps getting worse.
Okay. I.V. beta blocker and topical nitro.

11:26.979 --> 11:30.983
I don't know if you're going
to get to talk to this fella after all.

11:36.363 --> 11:40.367
Five's a crowd, buddy.

12:01.180 --> 12:05.934
Whoa. Something must have worked.
Heart rate's dropping.

12:05.976 --> 12:09.980
BP's headed south.
I don't understand;  what'd you just do?

12:09.980 --> 12:13.984
Hell if I know but I'll take it.

12:53.565 --> 12:58.820
Oh, God.
Come on, Mulder.

12:59.363 --> 13:03.367
Hey, you, out!
This lab is quarantined. Go!

13:06.578 --> 13:08.580
- Mulder?
- Yeah.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.166
Mulder, it's me.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.377
You know how to pick them, I'll tell you that.

13:13.377 --> 13:17.172
Look, I have no idea what killed this woman
but I have to assume it's communicable.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.173
Yeah.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.093
Another body has been found
just outside of Montello--

13:21.093 --> 13:24.596
same apparent cause of death--
some kind of massive aneurysm or rupture.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.974
- Uh-huh.
- And Mulder, I've called the C.D.C.

13:26.974 --> 13:30.686
They're on their way
but Patrick Crump may be infected.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.188
So you need to quarantine
his cell and make sure that anybody...

13:33.188 --> 13:37.192
who's had any close contact with him
whatsoever has been quarantined as well,

13:37.359 --> 13:41.363
and that means you, Mulder.
You're to have no contact with him whatsoever.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.283
Mulder?

13:44.283 --> 13:48.287
Well, that's going to be a little tough, Scully.

13:56.378 --> 14:00.382
Drive.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.061
Where are they?

14:13.061 --> 14:17.274
Route 789, heading west.
We're keeping them in visual plus...

14:17.274 --> 14:18.984
we're in phone contact...

14:18.984 --> 14:22.487
not to mention the strings
we pulled to keep this off local TV.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.781
- Where are they going?
- Crump won't say.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.784
Wherever it is, though,
he ain't getting there.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.496
- Roadblock?
- We'll shut him down east of Tuscarora--

14:30.496 --> 14:33.373
- nice, clean, remote space we can own.
- All right.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.167
I want the C.D.C. on-site.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.586
I want the officers making the arrest
to be wearing level...

14:37.586 --> 14:42.090
two or better anti-contamination suits.
I want the car decontaminated.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.593
I want Agent Mulder
and Crump decontaminated.

14:44.593 --> 14:48.597
- I want them quarantined separately.
- You got it.

14:57.064 --> 15:01.735
Crump says that if we don't pull back
our escort he's going to shoot your partner.

15:04.196 --> 15:07.991
You just leave me the hell alone!

15:07.991 --> 15:11.995
Now!

15:23.590 --> 15:26.969
How about if we just pull
over and let me out, too, huh?

15:26.969 --> 15:30.973
- I must be cramping your style.
- Just... Shut up.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.192
It's you people.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.278
- Figures.
- What figures?

15:44.278 --> 15:48.282
Shut up.

15:48.365 --> 15:52.369
Hey! No!
No!

15:53.579 --> 15:56.790
That is... so stupid, Crump.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.959
- Shut up.
- That is so stupid.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.963
You shut up and drive, you understand?

16:10.762 --> 16:12.181
- What are you doing?
- What? What am I doing?

16:12.181 --> 16:14.766
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm composing a sonnet.

16:14.766 --> 16:18.770
- I'm slowing down for a light.
- Go!

16:19.396 --> 16:23.358
Go!

16:47.799 --> 16:51.386
Crump?

16:51.386 --> 16:53.764
Is this what happened to your wife?

16:53.764 --> 16:57.768
This same thing?
If you stop moving, you die?

16:58.185 --> 17:00.187
I think I saw this movie.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.065
Why didn't you tell anybody?
Why didn't you tell the police?

17:03.065 --> 17:05.858
Oh, geez.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.194
I don't know how well you
recall the last 30 seconds...

17:08.194 --> 17:11.573
but your life is in my hands regardless
of whether or not you hold that gun.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.784
- It's right here, boy.
- Just tell me everything you know.

17:13.784 --> 17:16.369
- That may be the only way I can help you.
- You people put me here!

17:16.369 --> 17:20.165
Shut up.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.167
I'm guessing we got
two or three miles before the roadblock.

17:23.167 --> 17:27.172
- What roadblock? I got rid of the cops.
- Check your window.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.598
Oh, God.

17:36.598 --> 17:40.561
Men, if we get stopped...

17:52.781 --> 17:56.368
Subject's turning off 789
about a mile east of your position...

17:56.368 --> 17:58.996
and is heading north on a fire road.
Looks like he's going to miss you.

17:58.996 --> 18:03.000
Say what?

18:03.792 --> 18:07.796
- What's the report, Captain?
- They lost them.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.799
They were last seen
on a forestry service road.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.385
Trees were too thick.
Our helicopter lost sight of them.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.096
How did Crump know to avoid the roadblock?

18:16.096 --> 18:17.472
That's the question.

18:17.472 --> 18:21.476
I was hoping your Agent Mulder
would manage to steer him toward it, but...

18:23.270 --> 18:25.564
Maybe Agent Mulder
steered him away from it.

18:25.564 --> 18:29.568
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe he knew something that we don't.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.785
Agent Scully, I've got the cell
cultures from the second victim.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.999
Anything?

18:43.999 --> 18:47.961
So far, I'm seeing no evidence
of infection in either victim.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.761
So then, we're in the clear?

18:55.761 --> 18:59.765
No, no. Not necessarily.
I mean, something killed these people.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.561
Sorry. Excuse me.
Scully.

19:04.561 --> 19:08.565
Agent Scully?,
Please hold for Assistant Director Kersh.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.361
- Agent Scully.
- Yes, sir.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.571
How is Southern Idaho?

19:14.571 --> 19:19.076
Agent Scully? Southern Idaho?
Think carefully.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.163
Sir, I am not currently in the state of Idaho.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.581
No, you're not.

19:24.581 --> 19:28.377
In the course of prosecuting
our assignment in Idaho,

19:28.377 --> 19:31.588
Agent Mulder and I
came across a situation in Nevada...

19:31.588 --> 19:34.591
which we both strongly felt
needed our immediate attention.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.594
I eagerly await your report.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.388
In the meantime,

19:39.388 --> 19:41.682
agents of our Las Vegas
field office will be available...

19:41.682 --> 19:44.768
to assist you in tracking down Agent Mulder.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.562
Thank you, sir.

19:46.562 --> 19:48.772
Oh, Agent Scully...

19:48.772 --> 19:52.776
I think, at this point I want
to see him alive even more than you do.

20:10.961 --> 20:14.965
Can I see that for a minute?

20:15.799 --> 20:18.385
This man worked at
Silver State Power reading meters.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.761
Yes.

20:19.761 --> 20:23.765
What if he read the meter
at Vicky Crump's place?

20:35.194 --> 20:37.196
Crump?

20:37.196 --> 20:40.991
Crump, what else can you tell me
about what's happening to you?

20:40.991 --> 20:43.160
Mr. Crump.

20:43.160 --> 20:47.164
You call me by my last name,
you say "mister" in front of it.

20:47.372 --> 20:51.376
- "Mister." I got you.
- Not Crump. Mr. Crump.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.796
I can think of something else
I'd like to call you.

20:54.796 --> 20:58.759
I could put "mister"
in front of that, too if you'd like.

21:00.594 --> 21:03.972
You know, what kind of name
is Mulder, anyway? What is that, like...

21:03.972 --> 21:07.559
- like, Jewish?
- Excuse me?

21:07.559 --> 21:10.562
Jewish... It is, right?

21:10.562 --> 21:14.566
It's Mr. Mulder to you,
you peanut-picking bastard.

21:15.192 --> 21:19.196
Now, Mr. Crump what can you
tell me about what's happening to you?

21:19.780 --> 21:21.990
- What?
- You're going...

21:21.990 --> 21:24.576
- The wrong way.
- What do you mean so "The wrong way"?

21:24.576 --> 21:27.579
- Go this... Go this way!
- I can't... I can't go...

21:27.579 --> 21:31.583
I can't go left.
There's only trees there.

21:31.792 --> 21:35.796
Crump.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.985
Crump...

21:57.985 --> 22:01.572
It's west. Huh, west?
You got to head west.

22:01.572 --> 22:04.575
It's just like you did with your wife.
You took her and you headed west.

22:04.575 --> 22:07.578
It's not just motion;
it has to be in one direction.

22:07.578 --> 22:11.582
Is that right?

22:13.959 --> 22:17.963
What the hell happened to you?

22:40.569 --> 22:45.741
Okay, I want a thorough search
with an eye to the usual disease vectors.

22:45.991 --> 22:49.995
You got it.

23:11.600 --> 23:15.562
I think we're witnessing
the same pathology here.

23:19.983 --> 23:23.362
We need to get a blood sample.

23:23.362 --> 23:27.366
Let's go.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.385
Try to hold him still!

23:46.385 --> 23:50.389
Hang on.
Let me sedate him.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.577
One more time.
You woke up this morning... then what?

24:11.577 --> 24:13.370
We have been through this.

24:13.370 --> 24:17.374
You woke up this morning
but you didn't go to work. Why?

24:18.584 --> 24:23.547
It was raining. You don't shingle in the rain.
I was up at 6:00, reading the paper.

24:23.797 --> 24:27.759
What was your wife doing?

24:31.180 --> 24:36.476
Cooking, man. Breakfast. She was just
putting breakfast on the table when the...

24:38.562 --> 24:40.689
- You looked up.
- I looked up,

24:40.689 --> 24:44.693
and I saw that she had
this nosebleed she didn't even know she had.

24:44.985 --> 24:48.989
- What caused it?
- What do I... I'm... I'm, like, Quincy?

24:48.989 --> 24:51.575
How the hell should I know what caused it?

24:51.575 --> 24:54.369
It just happened.

24:54.369 --> 24:56.580
Ten, 15 minutes later, she just...

24:56.580 --> 25:00.167
Starts getting sick.

25:00.167 --> 25:04.171
Said she got a headache that just...
keeps getting worse and worse.

25:12.387 --> 25:16.391
Then she starts... screaming.

25:17.768 --> 25:20.771
I didn't know what the hell to do.
I just, uh...

25:20.771 --> 25:24.775
I got her in the truck and...
Taking her to the hospital...

25:26.568 --> 25:30.572
but then it seemed like
the faster we went the better she'd do...

25:30.989 --> 25:34.993
but just as soon as
I try to slow down or stop...

25:38.789 --> 25:42.793
I'm sorry about your wife.

25:45.170 --> 25:49.883
Sure, you are...
You and the rest of your Jew F.B.I.

25:50.175 --> 25:50.968
- Crump...
- Oh, yeah.

25:50.968 --> 25:52.761
You think I don't know, huh?

25:52.761 --> 25:55.389
You think I'm just
some ignorant pudknocker, don't you?

25:55.389 --> 25:59.393
But I get it, man!
I see what this is!

25:59.977 --> 26:03.981
I am not sick and I do not have the flu.

26:06.984 --> 26:10.988
Vicky and me were just some kind of...
Government guinea pigs.

26:12.364 --> 26:15.993
- You think the government did this to you?
- Hell, yeah. Who else?

26:15.993 --> 26:18.996
You see it all the time on the TV:

26:18.996 --> 26:21.165
they're dropping Agent Orange,

26:21.165 --> 26:24.585
they're putting radiation
in little retarded kids' gonads...

26:24.585 --> 26:27.963
Oh, yeah. You sons of bitches
sneaking around my woods at night--

26:27.963 --> 26:31.967
I seen you.
You think I don't know?

26:40.767 --> 26:43.395
Well, on behalf of
the international Jewish conspiracy...

26:43.395 --> 26:46.398
I just need to inform
you that we're...

26:46.398 --> 26:50.360
almost out of gas.

26:59.161 --> 27:03.165
The trailer looks clean--
no readily apparent vectors.

27:12.591 --> 27:16.929
Dogs, housewives...
Whatever this thing is, it doesn't discriminate.

27:16.970 --> 27:20.974
There are zoonotic pathogens
which spread among species.

27:23.977 --> 27:27.981
Look at that.

27:28.774 --> 27:32.778
The Crumps have a neighbor.

27:42.788 --> 27:45.999
Hello!

27:45.999 --> 27:49.962
Hello?

27:57.594 --> 28:01.598
Doctor?

28:17.573 --> 28:21.702
Hello?

28:22.953 --> 28:26.999
Hello?

28:42.181 --> 28:44.975
Oh, no. It's...
It's okay, ma'am. It's okay.

28:44.975 --> 28:46.768
- Who are you?
- It's all right. I'm sorry.

28:46.768 --> 28:50.772
Go away! Go away!

28:58.197 --> 29:02.159
It's okay.
It's okay.

29:05.996 --> 29:09.958
Okay, Crump, we got
about one more mile.

29:10.959 --> 29:14.171
I'll make it fast.
You ready?

29:14.171 --> 29:18.175
Here goes nothing.

29:48.789 --> 29:52.167
Hey, turn on the pump!

29:52.167 --> 29:56.171
Number four!
Three!

29:58.173 --> 30:00.968
Number three!
Turn it on!

30:00.968 --> 30:04.972
You got to pay
before you pump, buddy!

30:28.996 --> 30:33.000
Hey, dammit, that's my car!
Where the hell do you think you're going?

30:59.359 --> 31:03.363
One deaf woman survives unscathed
while everything else around her dies.

31:03.780 --> 31:07.784
Why?

31:18.795 --> 31:22.799
What... What are you doing?

31:23.383 --> 31:27.179
The pathology of this thing...

31:27.179 --> 31:29.389
It affects the inner ear...

31:29.389 --> 31:33.393
and this area right here is ground zero.

31:35.771 --> 31:39.775
What if what we're looking for
is some kind of a sound?

31:39.775 --> 31:43.779
Seriously?

31:44.988 --> 31:48.992
Oh.

31:50.994 --> 31:54.998
Excuse me.

31:56.959 --> 31:59.378
- Scully.
- It's Van Gelder.

31:59.378 --> 32:01.588
Agent, I don't know
what the hell your partner's thinking...

32:01.588 --> 32:05.592
but not only is he actively
evading my officers, now he's stolen a car.

32:05.968 --> 32:08.387
- Come again?
- You heard right.

32:08.387 --> 32:12.182
He left behind
a crazy note addressed to you.

32:12.182 --> 32:16.186
- You there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Read it to me.

32:16.395 --> 32:20.190
"Crump sick; will die
if stopped same as wife.

32:20.190 --> 32:24.194
Must head west to keep alive.
No roadblocks!" Exclamation point.

32:25.988 --> 32:29.992
- This make any sense to you?
- Take him at his word.

32:30.367 --> 32:32.369
Let him through.

32:32.369 --> 32:34.788
Let him through?
Look, uh...

32:34.788 --> 32:38.792
No offense, Agent Scully but how 'bout you
run that by your superiors 'cause frankly,

32:38.792 --> 32:42.588
I think they'll say different.

32:42.588 --> 32:45.799
I'll take that under advisement.

32:45.799 --> 32:49.761
Agent Scully, again, I got to say
I feel like we got a situation here that...

33:10.782 --> 33:14.786
Faster.

33:14.786 --> 33:16.163
I'm doing 70.

33:16.163 --> 33:18.874
You got to go faster.
It's getting worse.

33:18.874 --> 33:22.878
Okay.

33:24.379 --> 33:28.383
Yeah, yeah.
That's good. Okay.

33:29.593 --> 33:33.597
Hey, uh...

33:33.597 --> 33:37.559
The Jew stuff?

33:37.559 --> 33:41.563
No offense.

33:42.564 --> 33:46.568
I mean, uh...
A man can't help who he's born to.

33:47.778 --> 33:51.782
That was an apology, right?

33:52.199 --> 33:56.161
Gee, I don't know if I can see to drive
my eyes are tearing up so bad.

33:57.996 --> 34:01.959
Whatever, man.

34:06.588 --> 34:09.800
Why are you doing this?

34:09.800 --> 34:13.387
- Why am I doing what?
- This.

34:13.387 --> 34:16.598
It's not in your best interest
to make me question that right now.

34:16.598 --> 34:20.561
How do I know you ain't doing
exactly what they want you to?

34:20.768 --> 34:22.187
Hmm?

34:22.187 --> 34:26.190
Driving me all around creation, experimenting
on me... How do I know it ain't that?

34:27.568 --> 34:31.572
I guess you don't.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.993
I ain't saying you are.

34:35.993 --> 34:39.996
I'm just saying...
That's no way to treat a man...

34:40.164 --> 34:44.168
take away his dignity like that.

34:45.377 --> 34:49.380
It ain't right.

34:50.382 --> 34:54.386
Better just to kill him.

34:54.969 --> 34:58.974
That's all I'm saying.

35:04.188 --> 35:06.773
Hey, you got to stay alive
if you want to stick it to the government.

35:06.773 --> 35:10.777
If you die, you let them
off the hook. Am I right?

35:13.363 --> 35:17.367
- Huh?
- You're right. You're damn straight.

35:18.577 --> 35:20.996
We'll figure this out.

35:20.996 --> 35:24.958
You'd better figure quick.
We're running out of west.

35:49.191 --> 35:52.361
Lieutenant Breil?
My name is Dana Scully.

35:52.361 --> 35:55.572
I called in regard to the electrical
equipment the Navy is maintaining...

35:55.572 --> 35:58.367
- in the town of Montello.
- Right. Listen, I don't know if there's...

35:58.367 --> 36:02.371
been some miscommunication between
you and your Washington office, but, uh...

36:02.371 --> 36:04.373
- My Washington office?
- Yeah.

36:04.373 --> 36:08.377
I was under the impression that I'd
explained this to the F.C.C.'s satisfaction.

36:08.585 --> 36:12.589
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry
to make you run through it again, uh...

36:13.799 --> 36:17.761
For my official report to the,
uh... To the F.C.C.

36:17.761 --> 36:18.762
Okay.

36:18.762 --> 36:22.766
At 6:17 yesterday morning during a test
of our ground conduction radio system...

36:23.183 --> 36:27.187
a situation arose in which our equipment
experienced a brief power surge.

36:27.771 --> 36:31.775
That's what interrupted
television reception in the four-state area.

36:31.775 --> 36:34.987
However, steps have already been taken
to insure this won't happen again.

36:34.987 --> 36:38.574
The ground conduction radio--
th-that would be Project Seafarer?

36:38.574 --> 36:41.160
The specifics of what
we do here are classified, ma'am.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.996
Sure, sure. Um...

36:43.996 --> 36:48.000
Would you happen to know what effect
such a surge might have on, uh...

36:48.167 --> 36:52.171
On an organism... Say, a...
Say, a human being?

36:53.797 --> 36:57.176
- Theoretically speaking.
- Theoretically speaking?

36:57.176 --> 37:01.180
Well, that's classified as well, ma'am.

37:05.184 --> 37:09.188
- Crump?
- Mr. Crump.

37:09.563 --> 37:11.982
Mr. Crump...

37:11.982 --> 37:15.986
What is it, Mr. Mulder?

37:38.175 --> 37:40.385
Mulder, are you okay?

37:40.385 --> 37:42.971
Yeah, aside from terminal
cell phone withdrawal...

37:42.971 --> 37:44.598
That, and I got to pee.
Where are you?

37:44.598 --> 37:48.393
I'm just about to board
a justice department jet...

37:48.393 --> 37:50.187
Hopefully, I'll overshoot you.

37:50.187 --> 37:52.981
- Headed where?
- I don't know, Mulder.  You tell me.

37:52.981 --> 37:55.776
I'm guessing wherever the hell
route 36 ends but we can't stop, Scully.

37:55.776 --> 37:58.987
I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do next.

37:58.987 --> 38:01.782
Well, I think I have
a loose theory as to what caused this.

38:01.782 --> 38:05.160
- Well, lay it on me.
- Okay.

38:05.160 --> 38:09.164
Mulder, you know what E.L.F. waves are?
Extremely low radio transmissions?

38:09.581 --> 38:12.167
Yeah. It uses an antenna,
like, 50 miles long.

38:12.167 --> 38:14.795
The military uses it to communicate
with the trident submarines,

38:14.795 --> 38:16.380
Project Seafarer, Project Haarp.

38:16.380 --> 38:21.468
Well, Seafarer has an antenna array stretching
beneath the edge of Patrick Crump's property.

38:21.593 --> 38:23.971
Now, ELF fields have been shown to...

38:23.971 --> 38:26.765
To produce biological effects in human tissue...

38:26.765 --> 38:30.185
inducing electrical currents,
altering chemical reactions.

38:30.185 --> 38:33.272
Not to mention that as a potential weapons
application it's been referred to...

38:33.272 --> 38:36.775
as "electrical nerve gas" or may be
behind the so-called "Taos Hum."

38:36.775 --> 38:39.778
What if some overload some...
Some hum from this system...

38:39.778 --> 38:43.365
could somehow match the resonant
frequency of the human skull?

38:43.365 --> 38:46.368
I mean, what if it could induce a like hum that could...

38:46.368 --> 38:48.996
That could somehow exert a...

38:48.996 --> 38:52.374
a rising pressure on the labyrinth
of the inner ear in a sense shattering it?

38:52.374 --> 38:56.378
But with constant movement somehow
ameliorating that pressure making it bearable.

38:56.962 --> 39:00.966
- But why only westward movement?
- I don't know, Mulder, I don't know. I mean...

39:00.966 --> 39:04.970
I mean, maybe it has to follow
certain lines of force electrical or magnetic.

39:05.387 --> 39:07.973
The big question, Scully,
is what do we do about it?

39:07.973 --> 39:11.977
Well, I think I know, Mulder, but it's
nothing that Mr. Crump is going to like.

39:20.986 --> 39:24.198
We'll be there.

39:24.198 --> 39:25.365
What?

39:25.365 --> 39:28.577
Well, whether they did this to you
intentionally or not, you were right.

39:28.577 --> 39:32.372
They did it to you.

39:32.372 --> 39:36.168
So, what do we...
what do we do?

39:36.168 --> 39:39.796
Your one chance is that we meet
my partner at the end of the highway.

39:39.796 --> 39:42.966
There, she will insert a long,
large-bore needle into your inner ear...

39:42.966 --> 39:45.761
hopefully relieving the pressure.

39:45.761 --> 39:47.971
Now, when we get there
she's going to have to work fast.

39:47.971 --> 39:49.973
She's only going to have one chance.

39:49.973 --> 39:52.559
She's not going to be
able to use any anesthetic...

39:52.559 --> 39:56.563
and it will probably leave you deaf.

39:58.565 --> 40:02.569
But I'll live, right?

40:03.987 --> 40:07.991
Well, that's what it's all about.
All right, man. Let's do it.

40:13.997 --> 40:17.960
Mr. Mulder, could you go
a little faster, please?

40:18.377 --> 40:22.381
- Just a little more is all I need.
- Sure.

40:28.762 --> 40:32.766
Just a little bit faster.

41:15.767 --> 41:19.771
Get ready!

42:41.979 --> 42:48.402
"Justice department jet: 2.6 turbine hours
round trip at $1,400 an hour.

42:51.363 --> 42:56.535
Car rental-- over-mileage,
out-of-state use penalties: $346.

42:56.785 --> 42:59.163
Compensation to one Walter R. Duncan...

42:59.163 --> 43:04.668
for unauthorized use of
his 1968 Caprice station wagon: $500."

43:04.793 --> 43:06.587
Why don't you bill me?

43:06.587 --> 43:11.842
I'll bill your partner instead.
You too obviously relish the role of martyr.

43:13.760 --> 43:17.764
Okay. So
are we done here?

43:19.391 --> 43:23.187
Back to the bozo work
investigating huge piles of manure?

43:23.187 --> 43:27.191
You can always quit.

43:40.579 --> 43:44.791
- Sir, Agent Mulder has been through a lot.
- And you apologize for him a lot.

43:44.791 --> 43:48.795
- I've noticed that about you.
- I'm not apologizing for this.

43:49.171 --> 43:53.175
Because of his work, the D.O.D. is shutting
down their antenna array in northeastern Nevada.

43:54.176 --> 43:56.595
Our participation in this case
has saved lives.

43:56.595 --> 43:58.597
I don't see you proving that.

43:58.597 --> 44:01.975
The Department of Defense
admits no culpability whatsoever.

44:01.975 --> 44:05.979
Furthermore, they say the closing
of the facility was coincidental.

44:07.773 --> 44:11.777
Right.

44:12.569 --> 44:15.781
Don't misunderstand me, Agent.

44:15.781 --> 44:18.575
I don't care if you
and your partner saved a school bus...

44:18.575 --> 44:22.579
full of doe-eyed urchins
on their way to Sunday bible camp.

44:23.372 --> 44:26.959
You no longer investigate X-Files.
You are done...

44:26.959 --> 44:30.963
and the sooner you and Mulder come to
recognize that, the better for both of you.

44:39.179 --> 44:43.183
Big piles of manure.
