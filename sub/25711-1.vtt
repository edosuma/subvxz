00:05.797 --> 00:07.466
Good afternoon, everyone,

00:07.549 --> 00:11.136
and welcome to the Global Summit
for Medical Technology.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.098
Here in this room,

00:15.182 --> 00:17.726
many of you
have inspired generational leaps

00:17.809 --> 00:19.061
in medical technologies.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.776
You've created whole new fields
of medical advances.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.821
You've explored new horizons
and broken barriers.

00:30.322 --> 00:33.784
And everything we do is a means to the end

00:33.867 --> 00:37.496
of unleashing innovation
to improve and save lives.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.797
Watches and cell phones
that monitor blood sugar.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.467
3-D printers to create prosthetic limbs.

00:51.426 --> 00:55.055
Artificial intelligence
that today diagnoses melanoma.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.141
All of these things exist today.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.609
So let's pause for a minute
and take a look at the future.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.028
What if, by 2050,

01:10.487 --> 01:13.574
we have micro laboratories
implanted in our bodies

01:13.657 --> 01:16.285
that predict illnesses
before we ever get sick?

01:22.708 --> 01:28.338
What if, by 2050, we have 3-D printers
creating custom biomechanical organs?

01:32.843 --> 01:37.431
Or what if artificial intelligence
can be used to predict heart attacks

01:37.514 --> 01:39.683
before they even happen?

01:45.147 --> 01:46.398
If we succeed...

01:47.482 --> 01:51.194
imagine the impact we will have
on medical care.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.953
Let's continue to improve lives
by unleashing innovation.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.346
Before you're born,

02:17.429 --> 02:20.515
they use medical devices to find out
when you're gonna be born.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.434
When you're born,

02:22.517 --> 02:25.395
they use medical devices
to find out how healthy you are.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.066
When you're growing up,
they oftentimes use medical devices

02:29.149 --> 02:31.276
to enhance what's going on with you.

02:31.860 --> 02:35.572
Medical devices are a way of life
in America.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.325
They are a way of life
in postindustrial society.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.953
They are a reason,
in some ways, for postindustrial society.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.622
They help us live longer.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.624
They give us better quality of life.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.751
And they're just about everywhere.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.837
There are devices
that are truly lifesaving.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.882
My husband has a pacemaker in.
I'm glad for it.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.050
It saved his life.

02:55.133 --> 02:59.179
I have a cataract lens in
that makes me see beautifully.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.558
It's everything from the very simple
little thing like a tongue depressor

03:03.642 --> 03:05.352
to breast implants,

03:05.435 --> 03:07.562
drug-eluting stents.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.607
There's such an array of devices.
It's pretty amazing.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.113
The medical device industry
is a 300 billion-a-year industry.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.864
This is big business.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.659
It's kind of a parallel
to the drug industry,

03:20.742 --> 03:22.911
and it isn't nearly as well understood.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.871
People think pharma's got power.

03:24.955 --> 03:25.789
No, no, no, no.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.542
The device industry
has much more power than pharma.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.087
The medical device industry has been
expanding faster

03:32.170 --> 03:33.922
than just about any other industry.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.967
And that's because technology
is just running away right now.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.637
And it's running away faster than we're
keeping up with the actual science.

03:41.430 --> 03:45.392
We're living
in a very highly technological society,

03:45.767 --> 03:49.146
and medical technology
is a... a wonder and a miracle.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.358
But because it's everywhere,
we have to be careful.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.343
I grew up in Western New York,
right between Rochester and Buffalo.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.637
I'm a mail carrier.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.476
And I work in the morning,
delivering mail to 70 mailboxes.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.401
I'm married.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.111
Hey, Bud. Do me a favor?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.363
I was engaged
to somebody else,

04:41.239 --> 04:44.993
and we broke up, and my friends threw me
a party to try to make me feel better.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.661
And, um, he was driving by,

04:46.745 --> 04:49.456
and one of my friends yelled out to him,
"Porch party!"

04:49.664 --> 04:53.168
A friend of mine invited me in,
and that's kind of where we met.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.170
What did you like about her?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.213
Everything.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.009
My daughter didn't have a father
in her life,

05:01.092 --> 05:04.763
and Pete's children lost their mother
when she passed away.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.517
So to come together
and all of us to just have each other,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.143
it was just a blessing.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.779
My last child was born in 2009.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.366
I was 37 when we became pregnant.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.452
We had decided,
you know, we wanted to have one together,

05:27.536 --> 05:28.620
but that was enough.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.623
<i>So I went and spoke to my ob-gyn.</i>

05:33.917 --> 05:35.043
<i>And he talked to me</i>

05:35.126 --> 05:38.672
<i>about a new permanent birth control device
called Essure,</i>

05:38.964 --> 05:42.717
<i>which could be done right in the office,
and I could go back to work the next day.</i>

05:42.801 --> 05:44.344
Put them in there. Yeah.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.182
Wow!

05:51.101 --> 05:51.977
<i>You protect...</i>

05:54.145 --> 05:55.063
<i>...and prevent...</i>

05:57.440 --> 05:59.025
<i>...and even plan ahead.</i>

06:00.026 --> 06:02.028
<i>But what about your birth control?</i>

06:02.112 --> 06:05.949
<i>Maybe it's time to consider the proven,
permanent birth control of Essure.</i>

06:09.119 --> 06:12.372
Essure is
a permanent sterilization device.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.459
It is made out of
little four-centimeter coils.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.797
It's inserted through the uterus
and placed inside of the fallopian tubes.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.468
It's intentionally designed
to cause an inflammatory response,

06:25.552 --> 06:27.596
which generates scar tissue.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.516
The scar tissue closes off
the fallopian tubes permanently,

06:31.600 --> 06:33.894
blocking the sperm
and the egg from meeting,

06:34.185 --> 06:35.770
therefore preventing pregnancy.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.191
The early studies that were done
to get this device approved

06:40.275 --> 06:42.736
suggested it's 99% effective

06:42.986 --> 06:46.072
in closing the fallopian tube
and causing sterilization.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.658
It originally was designed by Conceptus

06:48.742 --> 06:50.327
and then bought by Bayer.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.164
It was marketed as a better choice
than the traditional tubal ligation

06:54.706 --> 06:57.834
<i>The Essure procedure does not require
any incisions.</i>

06:58.126 --> 07:02.422
<i>And because there are no incisions,
the procedure does not leave any scars.</i>

07:02.714 --> 07:05.884
<i>And when it comes to recovery
after the Essure procedure,</i>

07:06.134 --> 07:08.803
<i>women were typically discharged
from the medical facility</i>

07:08.887 --> 07:11.014
<i>within 45 minutes.</i>

07:11.097 --> 07:14.434
It took no time out of my life.

07:15.101 --> 07:19.648
And there was no chance
of having to go under anesthesia.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.943
I was a nurse assisting
in the placement of Essure

07:23.026 --> 07:24.569
during the clinical trials.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.782
So I watched the procedure.
I thought it was simple.

07:29.115 --> 07:33.578
It was non-surgical, it was permanent,
and it was everything I was looking for.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.792
Seeing how easy it was to put it in,
I thought I should do it too.

07:39.542 --> 07:43.004
<i>For us, we were now allowed
to have a type of intimacy...</i>

07:43.088 --> 07:45.757
The company liked my story
because I was a nurse,

07:45.840 --> 07:48.259
I'd participated
on both ends of the product.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.096
So I was invited to be a spokesperson.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.392
I even went so far as I had my own website
called <i>Ask Gaby.</i>

07:55.892 --> 07:58.687
Patients would to me,
doctors would write to me.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.563
I told them all the benefits.

08:01.272 --> 08:05.443
I used to tell them that it took longer
to get your nails done

08:05.527 --> 08:07.737
than it did to get sterilized.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.126
Where's your headband?

08:21.876 --> 08:24.295
Oh, hi!

08:24.838 --> 08:26.089
How was school?

08:26.172 --> 08:29.551
- We had to do dance inside, but...
- Yeah?

08:29.634 --> 08:31.052
We were inside the whole time.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.972
I have a full-time job in a business firm.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.140
I am an account executive.

08:37.017 --> 08:37.892
I love my job.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.438
I have four daughters.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.900
And I enjoy every moment
with my kids.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.994
I want to go on Area 51.
You've got to try that!

08:57.245 --> 09:01.082
My husband and I had decided
that four kids was enough.

09:02.292 --> 09:06.588
So when I went to my doctor,
my doctor recommended Essure.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.466
Wait, let me take a picture
of all you winners.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.259
Smile!

09:12.343 --> 09:13.178
Okay.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.721
He said that it was easy.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.931
You come in the office,
you leave and you're good.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.767
You go back to your normal life.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.313
<i>Thread the Essure device
through the introducer</i>

09:23.396 --> 09:25.023
<i>while you hold the hysteroscope.</i>

09:25.607 --> 09:28.943
<i>Slowly and steadily advance
the Essure delivery system</i>

09:29.027 --> 09:30.570
<i>into the fallopian tube.</i>

09:31.446 --> 09:33.406
He said I shouldn't feel anything.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.493
Just two little devices
that I wouldn't even notice.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.497
But the moment
I stepped out of the doctor's office,

09:40.580 --> 09:42.040
I started feeling cramping.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.833
Then, in the first week,

09:43.917 --> 09:46.211
I started bleeding
more than I have ever bled

09:46.294 --> 09:48.254
in my whole life during a period.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.340
I called the doctor.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.218
He's like, "Those two little things
doesn't do anything,

09:53.301 --> 09:55.678
doesn't do all those changes
that you're telling me."

09:56.179 --> 09:59.599
So I just kept continuing to believe
that it was in my head.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.351
I went in for the procedure.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.062
I could feel the whole thing.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.855
I felt it go into my tube.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.233
I remember hearing the clicking noises.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.235
I felt it expand.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.570
Um, it was pretty intense.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.283
After the procedure,
I was running fevers a lot.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.161
The bleeding was almost continual.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.540
There may be a day or two
during the month when I wasn't bleeding.

10:24.249 --> 10:28.044
The sharp, stabbing pain on my left side
was getting more and more intense.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.589
So I made an appointment to go in
and have an exam.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.884
The doctor ordered an ultrasound.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.804
He came in and he looked at the screen

10:37.887 --> 10:42.392
and just said, "Oh, it looks like one
of her Essure devices is in her uterus."

10:43.726 --> 10:45.186
And I was kind of in shock.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.314
So he says,
"You know, we need to get these out."

10:48.940 --> 10:49.774
And I agreed.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.444
Woke up and the doctor said,
"Everything went good."

10:53.945 --> 10:57.282
You know. "Go home and heal and rest
and you should feel better."

10:58.741 --> 11:02.537
But after the procedure,
I started having problems again.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.247
The bleeding started picking up.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.875
My husband had gone with me
to the hospital

11:06.958 --> 11:09.711
and we're in a room,
and I've got the IV in...

11:10.461 --> 11:13.381
and just blood exploded out of me.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.884
Like, it looked like a horror scene.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.511
And there were large clots
all over the floor.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.557
And he went out in the hallway
and just screamed for someone to come,

11:22.640 --> 11:24.267
and they all just came in.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.354
They threw me on a gurney, and off I went,

11:28.438 --> 11:29.814
stretcher down the hallway.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.065
I was scared.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.693
I was really thinking about...

11:33.943 --> 11:36.529
"What's gonna happen to my kids
if I don't wake up?"

11:44.704 --> 11:47.624
<i>The old-time medicine man
would sell his snake oil</i>

11:47.707 --> 11:49.334
<i>by positively guaranteeing</i>

11:49.417 --> 11:52.837
<i>it would cure any and every disease
known to man and beast.</i>

11:53.213 --> 11:55.798
<i>Fortunately,
this form of quackery in medicine</i>

11:55.882 --> 11:59.052
<i>is gradually being eliminated
by our food and drug laws,</i>

11:59.135 --> 12:00.845
<i>but there's still another form,</i>

12:00.929 --> 12:03.848
<i>equally dangerous
and far more difficult to control.</i>

12:03.932 --> 12:05.850
<i>Phony machines and devices,</i>

12:05.934 --> 12:10.063
<i>which are supposed to diagnose
and treat disease.</i>

12:10.146 --> 12:11.522
<i>Unlike new drugs,</i>

12:11.606 --> 12:15.526
<i>therapeutic devices do not have to be
proved either safe or effective</i>

12:15.610 --> 12:16.986
<i>before they are sold or used.</i>

12:19.822 --> 12:21.991
The history
of medical devices is odd.

12:22.617 --> 12:28.373
There was an explosion in the 1920s
and '30s and '40s of fraudulent devices

12:28.456 --> 12:31.376
that pretended to put sound waves
into the body to cure cancer

12:31.459 --> 12:34.295
or any number of these weird devices.

12:34.379 --> 12:38.091
Some were dangerous, such as ones
that had radioactive qualities.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.843
<i>There are some as phony
as a three dollar bill.</i>

12:41.344 --> 12:43.972
<i>Like this Zerret Applicator, for example,</i>

12:44.055 --> 12:47.141
<i>which has claimed to cure arthritis
with Z-rays.</i>

12:47.225 --> 12:49.185
<i>There are no Z-rays.</i>

12:50.019 --> 12:53.314
<i>Investigate before you invest
in health services or products.</i>

12:53.398 --> 12:55.275
<i>Help stamp out quackery.</i>

12:55.358 --> 12:57.485
<i>This has been
a public service announcement</i>

12:57.568 --> 12:59.529
<i>from the Food and Drug Administration.</i>

12:59.612 --> 13:02.115
For many years,
devices just came onto the market

13:02.198 --> 13:05.034
with the anecdotes
of doctors who used them,

13:05.118 --> 13:07.120
who would say, "Well, I think it works."

13:07.537 --> 13:12.667
It was only with
the Medical Device Amendments of 1976

13:12.750 --> 13:16.129
that devices came under control of FDA.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.672
At that point, industry argued,

13:17.755 --> 13:21.009
"We don't want to have to test everything
we're already using,

13:21.092 --> 13:22.969
pacemakers and other devices."

13:23.052 --> 13:26.264
And the FDA said,
"Okay, you can grandfather in

13:26.347 --> 13:30.351
anything that was on the market
prior to 1976.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.856
The regulation of medical devices
has always been less than ideal.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.860
Since 1976, the complexity of devices,
the number of devices,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.571
the types of devices,
just rapidly expanded.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.822
So we have the same framework

13:42.905 --> 13:45.491
that was imposed, you know, 40 years ago

13:45.950 --> 13:49.370
for a device world that is much more
complicated today.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.333
<i>Dr. Kessler,
please proceed when ready, sir.</i>

13:53.416 --> 13:58.838
<i>Mr. Chairman, Americans rightfully expect</i>

13:58.921 --> 14:00.715
<i>public health decisions...</i>

14:02.425 --> 14:05.303
<i>to be made in </i> their <i>interest</i>

14:06.012 --> 14:10.308
<i>and to be based on the best science
and medicine.</i>

14:10.683 --> 14:14.354
I was appointed as FDA commissioner
by the first President Bush

14:14.437 --> 14:16.856
and asked to stay on by President Clinton.

14:16.939 --> 14:23.279
FDA is the most important
consumer protection agency in the world.

14:23.821 --> 14:27.408
It regulates virtually everything
that comes in contact with the body.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.620
FDA is organized by centers.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.663
So there's a center for foods.

14:32.747 --> 14:37.043
There's a center for drugs,
there's a center for biologics

14:37.126 --> 14:39.837
and there's a center for medical devices.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.340
And FDA does a credible job

14:42.423 --> 14:45.051
with the vast majority of products.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.719
The problem we have...

14:47.345 --> 14:52.975
is that, when it comes to medical devices,
we built a system that doesn't work.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.380
Before I went into medicine,
I worked as a bike mechanic.

15:23.172 --> 15:28.678
I always have loved taking things apart
and putting them back together again.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.267
I grew up in Alaska.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.811
Both my parents were physicians.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.773
So I had a lot of knowledge
about medicine in general.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.571
He's probably the most genuine person
you'll ever meet.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.866
He's very caring, giving,

15:49.949 --> 15:53.035
honest, and his patients love him.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.872
That head now is ceramic.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.624
The stem is titanium alloy, same as...

15:58.708 --> 16:02.253
<i>The first operation I ever saw
as a third-year medical student</i>

16:02.336 --> 16:03.588
<i>was a hip replacement.</i>

16:03.671 --> 16:06.174
<i>And I loved it. Very mechanical.</i>

16:07.133 --> 16:09.177
<i>Something's broken and you fix it.</i>

16:09.260 --> 16:11.345
And it's... it's the simplicity of it.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.934
He was having
a lot of degenerative hip issues himself.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.978
And, on the one side,

16:19.061 --> 16:21.272
the pain was more prevalent
and persistent.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.151
It was starting to limit his bike riding.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.780
The hip was getting
progressively more painful.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.701
I realized,
doing the 100-Mile Winter Race,

16:33.784 --> 16:37.079
that I could never do that again
unless I got the hip replaced.

16:37.872 --> 16:41.083
The most critical fundamental
about hip replacement

16:41.167 --> 16:44.629
is what are the materials of the parts
and pieces that rub together?

16:44.712 --> 16:49.091
The most commonly used combinations
are ceramic-on-ceramic,

16:49.634 --> 16:54.305
ceramic-on-plastic, metal-on-plastic,
and metal-on-metal.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.767
The metal is almost exclusively
chrome cobalt.

16:58.434 --> 17:03.731
Cobalt is used in a lot of machine alloys,
because it's made very, very hard.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.233
It's one reason
that we use it in joint replacement.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.905
I was swayed
to the metal-on-metal ASR hip

17:10.988 --> 17:13.491
because that particular device
had been marketed

17:13.574 --> 17:15.992
specifically
to exceptionally active individuals.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.664
Within six weeks after my operation,

17:19.747 --> 17:24.292
I did a 200-mile road race
without a lot of difficulty.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.462
I... I thought it was great.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.887
Most people probably believe,
when they get a medical device implanted,

17:34.971 --> 17:37.098
be it a pacemaker or a joint,

17:37.765 --> 17:42.687
that those medical devices
have undergone appropriate testing

17:42.770 --> 17:45.481
to demonstrate that they are safe
and effective

17:45.565 --> 17:48.442
before they came on the market
and doctors started using them.

17:48.526 --> 17:51.571
But for most moderate
and high-risk devices,

17:51.654 --> 17:53.155
that is not the case.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.075
Originally, Congress intended
that almost all new devices

17:56.158 --> 17:57.910
go through pre-market approval.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.414
A PMA is similar
to a new drug application,

18:01.539 --> 18:05.042
in that a manufacturer
must test it first in humans,

18:05.126 --> 18:07.044
compile all this data,

18:07.128 --> 18:09.171
and then present that to FDA scientists,

18:09.255 --> 18:12.341
who will approve the device
if in fact it is safe and effective.

18:12.425 --> 18:16.637
Industry argues, "We're innovating,
we're changing products every year

18:16.721 --> 18:20.391
and that costs a lot of money, to test
each of those iterations in humans.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.686
So Congress established
the 510 process.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.898
For the 510 pathway,
all the manufacturer needs to demonstrate

18:27.982 --> 18:31.569
is that their device is substantially
equivalent, is the regulatory term,

18:31.652 --> 18:34.113
to another device
that's already on the market.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.698
That provision,

18:36.699 --> 18:38.576
which was meant as an exception,

18:39.243 --> 18:40.995
in essence, a little loophole...

18:41.621 --> 18:43.706
That exception became the rule.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.959
So the vast majority of devices today,

18:47.043 --> 18:52.465
regrettably, are regulated
under this framework.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.091
This really can cause problems

18:54.175 --> 18:57.595
when one medical device is approved
on the basis of being

18:57.678 --> 19:00.014
substantially equivalent
to a previous medical device

19:00.097 --> 19:02.516
that was approved
because it was substantially equivalent

19:02.600 --> 19:04.560
to an earlier medical device than that.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.646
You end up
with what we call a daisy chain.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.231
And then, quite often what you found

19:09.315 --> 19:12.318
is that some of these predicate devices,
as they call them...

19:13.069 --> 19:15.821
have been recalled from the market
because they've been failing.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.366
I called the FDA and asked them,

19:18.449 --> 19:21.994
"How can you clear something
based on a predicate device

19:22.078 --> 19:23.913
that's already been shown to be dangerous?

19:23.996 --> 19:27.792
And they said,
"We don't judge what the prior device is."

19:27.875 --> 19:31.087
So even if the device was recalled
because it was dangerous,

19:31.170 --> 19:34.298
you can still use it as a predicate
and get your device cleared

19:34.382 --> 19:36.258
'cause it's substantially equivalent.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.387
So there's a lot of problems
with that 510 system.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.473
And that's how metal-on-metal hips
got on the market.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.854
A year and a half
after my operation,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.107
I started having a slew

19:51.190 --> 19:54.193
of health issues that I hadn't had before.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.406
I developed a tremor
in my non-dominant hand.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.991
His ears were ringing.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.453
He was starting to repeat himself a lot

20:04.537 --> 20:06.330
and explain things...

20:07.540 --> 20:08.541
over and over.

20:09.250 --> 20:14.547
As time went on,
those issues accelerated, and then,

20:14.630 --> 20:17.883
I... I had a psychological decompensation.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.846
He was attending a conference,
and I got a call.

20:22.680 --> 20:26.851
He had trashed a hotel room.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.228
He wrote all over the walls.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.188
He took pens, Sharpies,

20:31.272 --> 20:33.858
he wrote on the ceiling,
he wrote all over.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.193
And when that was done, he took soap...

20:36.819 --> 20:38.654
and he wrote on the mirrors.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.574
It was a full-on breakdown.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.828
You could see it in his eyes.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.246
And just...

20:47.705 --> 20:48.748
in turmoil...

20:50.124 --> 20:51.375
knowing full well...

20:52.126 --> 20:53.669
that he'd lost it.

20:54.837 --> 20:58.799
All the while, he's still thinking.
He's still connecting the dots.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.095
Eventually,
I started checking my blood and urine.

21:03.679 --> 21:09.101
And my levels of cobalt
were 100 times what I should have.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.189
I started calling up engineers at DePuy

21:13.272 --> 21:16.776
and salespeople, saying,
"Is anyone else talking about this?"

21:16.859 --> 21:18.152
The answer back was,

21:18.235 --> 21:20.529
"No, we've never heard
of that being a problem."

21:21.363 --> 21:25.075
But it was clear to me
that the hip would need to be redone.

21:25.576 --> 21:30.122
So I chose a different model
with a plastic socket and a ceramic head.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.710
When my doctor went in there
to revise my hip,

21:34.794 --> 21:38.172
he found a virtual crankcase
of metal sludge.

21:39.048 --> 21:43.761
And the critical ligaments, what we call
the hip capsule that holds a hip in place,

21:44.261 --> 21:45.846
that had just kind of liquefied.

21:49.934 --> 21:53.437
<i>Within a month,
I had an incredible recovery</i>

21:53.521 --> 21:58.067
<i>in terms of my psychologic symptoms
and my ability to think.</i>

21:59.735 --> 22:03.197
All the other symptoms
magically disappeared.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.491
I got my husband back.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.202
Come in.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.037
Hey, Rodney.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.163
Hello, Dr. Tower.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.289
A long time, no see.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.499
It's been a while.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.668
How was your drive?

22:16.043 --> 22:20.673
It was... The last 100 miles was snowy,
but it was a good drive before that.

22:21.423 --> 22:24.760
<i>Unless I'd personally
experienced this myself...</i>

22:25.427 --> 22:28.472
<i>I wouldn't believe an orthopedic implant</i>

22:28.556 --> 22:30.850
<i>could cause neurologic problems.</i>

22:31.517 --> 22:33.727
<i>But with my experience,</i>

22:33.811 --> 22:37.648
<i>I started to notice problems
in my own patients,</i>

22:37.731 --> 22:41.360
<i>and it's not just metal-on-metal,
but metal-on-plastics, too.</i>

22:41.443 --> 22:43.112
I was going blind.

22:43.195 --> 22:47.116
I was seeing stars,
constant stars in my eyes.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.868
I couldn't remember words.

22:49.493 --> 22:53.581
I'd start a sentence, then couldn't think
of the word that was supposed to go next

22:53.664 --> 22:55.207
Problems with memory.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.627
I was writing it off to, um, aging.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.630
I thought I had Alzheimer's or dementia.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.799
And that was really scary.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.303
Just diagnosed me with Parkinson's.

23:07.761 --> 23:11.599
My mind was... slowly slipping away.

23:12.433 --> 23:13.976
I've seen so much of this

23:14.059 --> 23:17.146
that now,
when a patient comes into the office,

23:17.229 --> 23:21.442
if they have an artificial hip
and I know it has a chrome cobalt piece,

23:21.942 --> 23:25.529
I routinely check
the level of cobalt in their urine.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.741
I've just been progressively
getting better and better

23:28.824 --> 23:31.869
since I had the hips both replaced.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.663
It's very hard
to convince people this problem exists,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.624
unless you show reversibility.

23:36.707 --> 23:39.251
Get rid of the cobalt,
the problem goes away.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.961
It's hard for people to argue with that.

23:41.545 --> 23:45.674
The real breakthrough
in the last 18 months

23:45.758 --> 23:50.012
has been the ability to actually image
the neurologic problem.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.766
Dr. Tower came down
to the Imaging Center

23:53.849 --> 23:55.851
to look at an MRI of the hip

23:55.935 --> 23:58.562
and we got into a discussion
about the symptoms

23:58.646 --> 24:00.648
of cobalt poisoning toxicity,

24:01.148 --> 24:03.275
and he mentioned cognitive issues.

24:03.359 --> 24:08.656
Dr. Bridges said, "Gee, yeah,
we ought to get an FDG PET brain scan

24:09.323 --> 24:13.077
on a patient that you think
is having the neurologic problems,

24:13.160 --> 24:14.787
because I bet we can see it.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.874
We have a tool that can
actually detect dementias like Alzheimer's

24:18.958 --> 24:22.461
years before they become clinically
evident on physical examination.

24:22.962 --> 24:27.299
Basically, what I'm looking at
is the slice through the basal ganglia.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.384
Blue is bad.

24:28.467 --> 24:32.388
Blue is bad. Those are the areas
of the brain that are most affected.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.723
By this scale, we're looking
at 2 to 3 standard deviation.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.935
At least greater
than two standard deviations below normal.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.938
The first patient came up very abnormal.

24:41.021 --> 24:43.857
So then he suggested we do another patient

24:43.941 --> 24:46.735
and then another patient,
and they all began to look the same.

24:47.528 --> 24:51.281
You've got the typical findings
on the brain scan

24:51.365 --> 24:53.742
that we're seeing
with the other 23 patients.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.369
So you're number 24.

24:58.414 --> 24:59.832
Doing a study on this

24:59.915 --> 25:03.293
is something that I feel
I'm morally obligated to do.

25:04.044 --> 25:07.214
But I don't think I should be the guy
who has to do that.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.261
This work really needs to be reproduced
with hundreds,

25:12.344 --> 25:16.849
if not thousands, of patients
to fully understand it.

25:17.516 --> 25:21.395
I think the CDC should be doing it.
I think the FDA should be doing it.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.439
And I've approached all those people,

25:23.522 --> 25:26.191
and just not getting
a lot of support there.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.448
I'm horrified because,
the more I'm looking at it,

25:33.574 --> 25:36.702
I'm beginning to wonder,
is cobalt the new mercury poisoning?

25:38.120 --> 25:40.664
Are these people being relegated
to the dustbin

25:40.748 --> 25:44.376
because they have what somebody
misperceives as dementia?

25:45.544 --> 25:46.920
How many people have been

25:47.004 --> 25:51.300
misdiagnosed
with a permanent disease process

25:51.383 --> 25:54.094
that actually have a reversible
disease process?

25:54.470 --> 25:56.180
That's the horror right there.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.998
<i>Innovation lives here.</i>

26:23.082 --> 26:27.669
<i>It's the foundation of our legacy
and the backbone of our DNA.</i>

26:28.420 --> 26:30.506
<i>Our motto is never stop moving.</i>

26:30.589 --> 26:35.135
<i>And some of the words that are behind that
are just this relentless pursuit...</i>

26:35.511 --> 26:39.640
<i>of innovation that improves patient care.</i>

26:46.188 --> 26:49.525
Industry likes to use the term
innovation, innovation, innovation.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.319
Innovation, to me,
means we've got something new,

26:52.402 --> 26:54.363
but we've got good evidence to support it.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.825
We've got good evidence about the benefits
and the harms.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.035
You're developing medicine,
you're bringing it forward.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.705
Without evidence, we don't know
whether it's really a development. It...

27:03.789 --> 27:05.499
You know? Who knows? You don't know.

27:05.791 --> 27:09.670
Surgeons and patients like the idea
that they're getting something new.

27:10.003 --> 27:13.090
I tell my patients
new equates to unproven.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.135
Companies can develop new products

27:16.218 --> 27:20.347
that may not be safer and more effective
than other products already on the market,

27:20.430 --> 27:22.724
but they will certainly
heavily promote them

27:22.808 --> 27:25.811
to doctors, to hospitals,
to drive up their profits.

27:26.395 --> 27:31.024
They wheel out patients and say,
"This person wouldn't be alive today

27:31.483 --> 27:34.486
if they didn't have
this innovative product."

27:34.903 --> 27:36.280
It's all very glossy.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.073
It's a slick machine.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.327
<i>We've doubled life expectancy
in 150 years.</i>

27:42.619 --> 27:44.580
And that's happened because of innovation.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.667
Just because you have a new technology
doesn't mean it's innovation.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.212
And, I think, too often I hear people say,
"Oh, you're gonna stifle innovation."

27:52.296 --> 27:54.256
They're not talking
about stifling innovation.

27:54.339 --> 27:58.552
They're talking about stifling, um,
putting untested devices on the market.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.095
That's not innovative.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.063
Before Essure,
the only times I was in the hospital

28:10.147 --> 28:11.773
was because I was pregnant.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.320
For the past three years
that I had the Essure,

28:16.403 --> 28:19.948
I've visited the hospital a lot
because of pain.

28:22.868 --> 28:26.079
I was working
and passed out 'cause of the pain,

28:26.455 --> 28:28.916
and I woke up
and I drove myself to the hospital.

28:30.042 --> 28:34.171
I'm more scared because,
if they have to admit me,

28:34.755 --> 28:37.341
I have to find someone
to take care of my kids.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.093
Especially because it's a school night.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.679
So I don't want them to miss school.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.723
Are you Ana Fuentes?

28:46.975 --> 28:49.478
After Essure,
my bleeding wouldn't stop.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.732
It came to the point that I had to start
wearing baby diapers.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.569
I couldn't even function
as a wife to my husband,

28:57.653 --> 28:59.821
and eventually, he ran away.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.450
One of the doctors that I had,

29:03.533 --> 29:07.871
he mentioned that most Latinas
have menstrual problems.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.832
So they thought it was...

29:11.416 --> 29:13.877
because I was Latina
that I would bleed a lot.

29:15.128 --> 29:18.215
But I'm like,
"I've been Latina since I was born

29:18.298 --> 29:20.050
and I became a...

29:20.133 --> 29:23.887
And my mom saw me grow up
and I never bleeded this much.

29:23.971 --> 29:26.682
So this doesn't have to do
with me being Latina."

29:43.615 --> 29:46.868
I've had a headache since 2011.

29:48.829 --> 29:50.747
Normally, the headache's about a four.

29:52.249 --> 29:55.002
And then at night, it starts spiking up.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.753
Seven, eight, nine.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.380
Sometimes ten.

30:07.222 --> 30:10.100
So this is my traction unit.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.520
It stretches my cervical spine,

30:13.770 --> 30:17.274
'cause the inflammation
gives me insane headaches.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.198
Before I had Essure put in,
I was really strong and really healthy.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.493
We went hiking, we went camping.

30:28.869 --> 30:31.288
I could do all the normal things
that moms do.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.499
It's hard for me
not to be doing those things.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.550
I did a little research.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.596
I didn't see too many people online
talking about Essure.

30:48.805 --> 30:52.934
And I said, "I have to warn my friends
and my family members,

30:53.018 --> 30:56.021
and I need to tell them
to stay away from this."

30:58.398 --> 31:00.359
So I started this little Facebook group

31:00.650 --> 31:04.071
called Essure Problems,
and I added all my girlfriends.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.282
I didn't really know
much about Facebook groups,

31:07.366 --> 31:11.453
but then slowly people that I didn't know
started commenting and saying,

31:11.536 --> 31:13.789
"Oh, my God,
this is what I'm going through."

31:14.498 --> 31:16.541
Just stories just started coming in.

31:19.628 --> 31:22.964
People just found me.
It just started snowballing.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.300
I remember hitting 65 people

31:25.384 --> 31:28.804
and going, "Wow, there's 65 people
that are having this problem."

31:29.429 --> 31:32.140
Every day, we had new people
joining the group.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.019
Women were telling their stories.

31:36.770 --> 31:40.232
<i>The day that I was implanted,
I left the hospital</i>

31:40.315 --> 31:41.691
<i>and I was in pain.</i>

31:41.775 --> 31:45.445
<i>They told me to take some Ibuprofen
and it'll get better.</i>

31:45.987 --> 31:52.119
<i>Now I'm going to the OB this week to have
a full hysterectomy at 31 years old.</i>

31:52.619 --> 31:56.206
Slowly, the progression of women
joining and having similar stories,

31:56.289 --> 31:59.251
um, we became a support group
for each other.

31:59.835 --> 32:04.047
And then we started finding information
about how the device was approved.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.758
We found out that Essure
went through something

32:06.842 --> 32:09.261
called the pre-market approval process,
or PMA.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.641
Pre-market approval
is the most stringent pathway

32:14.724 --> 32:16.268
to get a device approved.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.271
But even that process is not that strict.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.065
It's less rigorous
than the process for drugs.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.652
Most drugs had to have
two clinical trials,

32:25.735 --> 32:29.114
and they have to have large
numbers of patients.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.491
With devices, it's only one study.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.493
Those studies are often small.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.078
Sometimes it's 100 people.

32:35.162 --> 32:37.164
I've seen studies with 50 people.

32:37.622 --> 32:43.044
So the approval process
for the riskiest devices is not good.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.466
One of the members of the group
found the transcript

32:47.549 --> 32:49.551
for the 2002 approval meeting

32:49.885 --> 32:51.845
where the FDA approved Essure.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.848
I noticed at the bottom of the transcript

32:54.931 --> 32:56.933
that the entire meeting
had been videotaped

32:57.017 --> 33:00.061
by this video company,
and their phone number was there

33:00.437 --> 33:04.399
so I thought, "I should call them
and see if I can get a copy of that."

33:04.483 --> 33:06.776
And so I did, and they found it,

33:06.860 --> 33:10.489
and they said it was going to be
several hundred dollars.

33:10.572 --> 33:13.450
I put a post on the page.
I'm like, "I think we need this."

33:13.533 --> 33:18.121
And within 15 minutes, we raised $900
on the page, and I ordered those DVDs.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.958
<i>All right.
Let's go ahead and get started.</i>

33:22.042 --> 33:25.837
They approved this device
on such a small number of women

33:25.921 --> 33:28.089
that were followed
for such a short amount of time.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.718
The lead investigator
for the clinical trials

33:31.801 --> 33:34.012
who presented the evidence

33:34.095 --> 33:36.640
to the FDA
on the safety and efficacy of this device,

33:36.723 --> 33:39.392
he owned stock in this company.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.019
<i>I have received compensation</i>

33:41.102 --> 33:44.231
<i>which now represents
a financial interest in the company.</i>

33:44.940 --> 33:48.276
There was a paid spokesperson
that had Essure implanted herself.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.278
Gabriella Avina.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.197
They hired her to come and speak.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.742
<i>It brought about a peace
to my life and to my relationship</i>

33:55.825 --> 33:57.369
<i>that I cannot express to you.</i>

33:57.911 --> 34:02.374
And it was just mind-blowing
because they didn't have a lot of data

34:02.457 --> 34:04.668
for the questions
the panel members were asking.

34:05.001 --> 34:08.463
<i>What would happen if you touched
the electrode to the coils?</i>

34:08.547 --> 34:11.716
<i>How much
uterine cavity will be compromised?</i>

34:11.800 --> 34:14.886
<i>The panel was not supplied with
a summary about compatibility testing.</i>

34:14.969 --> 34:17.889
<i>What about the tubal perforation issue?</i>

34:17.973 --> 34:22.018
<i>I don't know what happens to people
with metal sensitivity</i>

34:22.143 --> 34:23.853
<i>when you implant metals in them.</i>

34:24.228 --> 34:28.065
They still approved it,
even with these open-ended questions.

34:28.149 --> 34:31.402
<i>The device clearly met the criteria
of safety and effectiveness</i>

34:31.485 --> 34:33.112
<i>that are required for approval.</i>

34:33.737 --> 34:36.116
At the end of the meeting,

34:36.199 --> 34:38.076
one of the panel members asked,

34:38.702 --> 34:41.663
"What are we gonna do
if we're seeing problems in ten years?"

34:42.330 --> 34:45.750
<i>Private investigators would find
each of us, bring us back here,</i>

34:45.833 --> 34:47.460
<i>and ask us why we approved this.</i>

34:52.215 --> 34:53.717
How could they joke about this?

34:53.800 --> 34:56.094
Like, they're joking about... us.

34:56.177 --> 34:59.514
You know, here we are, ten years later,
and all these problems...

35:00.015 --> 35:03.018
And... and, you know,
they approved it on... on a joke.

35:03.101 --> 35:07.230
If this is our FDA process
of medical device approval,

35:07.480 --> 35:10.108
then we have a big problem
in this country,

35:10.191 --> 35:11.943
because this is just one device.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.867
I'm from Nicholasville, Kentucky.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.703
Kind of a... Anywhere, USA.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.289
It's a small town.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.624
Great schools.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.876
Great people, wonderful church.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.337
I was in nursing.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.214
I did pediatrics, uh, children.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.009
And I just loved working with the people.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.679
My husband is a machinist
at General Electric.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.891
He works on the machines.
They're bigger than a house.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.309
He's my rock.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.270
Well, we met... Um...

35:48.271 --> 35:50.190
I was young and we were out partying.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.485
So, um, she was with a group of friends

35:53.568 --> 35:55.695
and I was kind of out on my own...

35:56.321 --> 35:58.698
um, looking for trouble, I should say.

35:59.616 --> 36:02.243
Ah... I found it!

36:03.411 --> 36:07.123
We've got a daughter
that's got a beautiful spirit.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.626
Very loving, very compassionate.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.837
Uh, make a great doctor one day,
if she chose to.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.924
I delivered my daughter at 41

36:16.299 --> 36:18.009
and I was working at the hospital,

36:18.093 --> 36:22.263
and when I would go to assist my patients
by transporting them from the bed,

36:22.347 --> 36:23.973
I would leak some.

36:24.057 --> 36:27.644
She started having some problem
with holding her urine.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.938
She went to the doctor to see about it.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.524
And, um, of course...

36:34.025 --> 36:36.736
they suggested some procedures.

36:36.820 --> 36:41.991
My doctor said, "We can take care
of that in a simple 45-minute procedure

36:42.075 --> 36:43.785
with this new thing called mesh.

36:44.494 --> 36:47.372
It's a simple, golden standard
outpatient surgery.

36:47.497 --> 36:50.750
It's better than sliced bread.
It's the new thing."

36:52.293 --> 36:57.882
Mesh is a polypropylene resin
that gets extruded into fibers

36:57.966 --> 37:00.635
and then woven and knit into a mesh.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.848
Johnson & Johnson saw that doctors
were starting to take hernia mesh

37:04.931 --> 37:08.977
and cut very little tiny pieces of it
to help support repairs

37:09.060 --> 37:13.189
where they felt they needed a little bit
extra because the woman's tissue was weak.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.108
So they said, "That's a great idea.

37:15.191 --> 37:18.153
Let's sell the hernia mesh
for pelvic floor treatments."

37:18.778 --> 37:22.115
As women get older,
and if they have several children,

37:22.198 --> 37:24.451
things start to bulge or drop.

37:24.534 --> 37:26.619
Patients come to us
and want things to be fixed.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.998
One approach is what's called
a native tissue repair,

37:30.081 --> 37:33.418
which is basically where we suture
things in place using stitches,

37:33.501 --> 37:34.586
suture material.

37:35.295 --> 37:41.176
Or, theoretically, one could use mesh
to augment the repair.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.053
The surgeon makes a cut in the vagina

37:44.137 --> 37:47.474
and then implants the mesh
to hold organs up in place.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.060
It costs about $25 to bring to market

37:51.144 --> 37:53.396
and they sell for about $2,000 a pop.

37:53.480 --> 37:58.401
I was told that it is superior to
the traditional surgery that's required.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.487
Very easy to place.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.072
Very, very few complications.

38:14.250 --> 38:17.962
I wish I could say that doctors
really understood

38:18.296 --> 38:20.799
the regulation of medical devices.

38:21.716 --> 38:26.304
But the fact is that's not what they do.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.265
That's not their area of expertise.

38:29.349 --> 38:33.853
We were surprised to see how little
surgeons knew, in our study,

38:33.937 --> 38:36.815
about the approval process for devices.

38:36.898 --> 38:40.902
Some of the surgeons seemed to think,
"Well, the FDA are taking care of this."

38:40.985 --> 38:43.446
That of course these devices
had been tested in humans.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.784
I came home from my surgery.

38:48.243 --> 38:51.079
I started having a lot of pain,
discomfort.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.458
I couldn't sit, I'd climb steps,
I felt like a 90-year-old woman.

38:55.542 --> 38:56.626
She had a bad fever.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.753
She was throwing up.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.423
We ended up going
to a few emergency rooms.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.718
We'd seen so many doctors.

39:06.302 --> 39:09.430
They didn't know what was going on
with her. They had no clue.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.808
Once you put mesh in,

39:11.891 --> 39:15.562
it is scarred into place,
permanently affixing it to the tissue.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.023
The scar tissue
causes the mesh to shrink up

39:19.107 --> 39:21.901
and as it shrinks, it starts to contract

39:21.985 --> 39:26.197
and pull against the adjacent tissues
that are in contact with the mesh.

39:26.281 --> 39:30.660
The scar tissue creates
a hard and flexible object in the pelvis.

39:31.744 --> 39:34.873
Around the vagina, around the bladder,
around the urethra.

39:34.956 --> 39:39.544
Structures that need to be able to move
in very subtle ways in order to function.

39:39.627 --> 39:43.089
Now you have this hard object in there,
and there's a cascade of problems.

39:44.591 --> 39:48.177
So eventually, I find this doctor
in Louisville.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.931
And he says,
"You've got a problem with your mesh

39:52.015 --> 39:53.516
and it needs to be removed...

39:54.142 --> 39:55.643
but I can't do it."

39:56.603 --> 39:59.564
I was never trained to take it out.
I've never took it out.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.900
We were just trained on how to put it in.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.484
Once it's scarred in place...

40:05.153 --> 40:06.029
that's it.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.240
Ain't coming out. Not in its entirety.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.994
I've been told
it's like removing rebar out of concrete,

40:13.077 --> 40:14.746
bubblegum out of your hair.

40:15.288 --> 40:17.415
Because of the position
that they're placed,

40:17.498 --> 40:19.667
they're in very delicate areas

40:19.792 --> 40:24.172
where it's almost impossible
to remove the mesh completely

40:24.255 --> 40:27.759
Once the scarring is complete,
the body doesn't want it to be there.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.970
So it keeps scarring and scarring,
keeps pushing and pushing,

40:31.262 --> 40:33.806
and sometimes it tries to push it
out of the body.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.352
So we do a partial mesh removal.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.520
Six to eight weeks of healing.

40:41.230 --> 40:45.485
My husband and I are trying to get back
to our sexual relations.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.612
I've set the stage, actually.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.323
I've got candles going,
I've got my daughter in bed.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.992
You know, I'm gonna feel
like a woman again.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.243
This mesh problem's gone.

40:55.536 --> 40:59.749
Very shortly into our intercourse,
my husband jumps up.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.084
When I penetrated her...

41:02.585 --> 41:04.128
I ended up getting a...

41:05.672 --> 41:06.547
cut.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.257
He grabs himself.

41:08.341 --> 41:10.176
He turns the light on.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.886
And I have cut...

41:12.428 --> 41:14.055
the top of his penis.

41:14.138 --> 41:17.016
I mean, like, what the hell?
You know? What's going on?

41:17.183 --> 41:19.852
And he's like, "Tammy,
you... you've cut me."

41:19.936 --> 41:21.771
She was confused about it.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.357
Just as well as I was.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.527
So I'm thinking in my head,
"Well, the rest of the mesh."

41:30.738 --> 41:32.365
As a woman, you're thinking,

41:32.448 --> 41:35.535
"Am I ever gonna be able to have relations
with my husband again?"

41:36.160 --> 41:38.287
Was he ever
gonna want to stay with me?

41:39.580 --> 41:42.917
At first, as she's going through
her illnesses and everything,

41:43.001 --> 41:44.585
you're not thinking about that.

41:45.336 --> 41:48.840
But then, you know,
we're talking an eight-year period...

41:49.924 --> 41:53.386
of not having relationships
with your mate.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.431
It can be really stressful.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.891
That was taken from us.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.603
I've had a major surgery...

42:03.187 --> 42:04.272
bladder repair...

42:04.772 --> 42:06.149
cervix removal...

42:06.524 --> 42:07.900
reconstruction.

42:07.984 --> 42:10.319
Your surgeries,
that's a grand total of how many?

42:10.403 --> 42:11.404
Oh, Lord.

42:11.487 --> 42:12.321
Eighteen?

42:13.239 --> 42:14.198
Nineteen?

42:14.866 --> 42:16.117
- Byonia?
- Yeah?

42:16.200 --> 42:17.493
What's today's surgery?

42:17.952 --> 42:19.954
I don't know. I've lost count.

42:21.748 --> 42:25.293
Byonia knows more about mesh
than a lot of doctors.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.212
She's been through every surgery.

42:31.549 --> 42:34.302
I want to be a good wife
and I want to be a good mother,

42:34.385 --> 42:37.847
and I still cannot do the things
I want to do with my daughter.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.976
- Slow up.
- Byonia, slow up.

42:42.268 --> 42:44.270
Yeah.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.272
Mommy can't keep up with you.

42:47.648 --> 42:51.444
I have a daughter that says, "I wish."
"Momma, I wish we could ride my bike.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.613
I wish that I could take your pain."

42:54.113 --> 42:56.199
The hardest one to hear is, uh...

42:58.618 --> 43:00.661
"Mommy, is it my fault you had mesh?"

43:03.122 --> 43:04.582
She's smart enough to know...

43:04.665 --> 43:06.000
She's heard women talk.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.670
That she knows it is a lot of it
from childbirth.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.633
That should never be in her heart
or her mind.

43:15.927 --> 43:16.886
That's my guilt.

43:20.223 --> 43:24.435
<i>We take our responsibilities
as a leader in health care very seriously.</i>

43:25.520 --> 43:27.522
<i>We're fortunate to be in an industry</i>

43:27.605 --> 43:30.817
<i>where human health care
is the basis of our business.</i>

43:31.901 --> 43:36.531
<i>And we measure success by improving
the quality of people's lives.</i>

43:37.949 --> 43:40.409
The CEO of Johnson & Johnson
is Alex Gorsky.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.703
Before he was the CEO,

43:42.995 --> 43:44.789
he actually was the head of Ethicon,

43:44.872 --> 43:48.000
the unit in the company
that these products were sold through.

43:48.626 --> 43:53.005
And on his watch, there was a flood
of information coming into the company...

43:53.923 --> 43:56.342
of women suffering
very severe complications.

43:57.093 --> 44:01.347
<i>When did anybody first
make you aware that anybody in the world</i>

44:01.430 --> 44:03.766
<i>had a concern
about the safety of the Prolift?</i>

44:04.350 --> 44:05.184
<i>I don't recall.</i>

44:06.310 --> 44:09.272
Before the pelvic mesh devices
even came to market,

44:09.355 --> 44:11.941
the surgeons who were developing
the prototypes...

44:12.650 --> 44:16.612
were telling Johnson & Johnson,
"This mesh is not safe."

44:17.446 --> 44:20.658
And the director of medical affairs
acknowledged it on the record

44:20.741 --> 44:22.118
when I took his deposition.

44:22.201 --> 44:24.245
<i>You knew significant retraction
could occur?</i>

44:24.328 --> 44:25.163
<i>Yes.</i>

44:26.914 --> 44:29.625
<i>You knew
that a significant retraction</i>

44:29.709 --> 44:31.878
<i>could lead to pain for the patient,
correct?</i>

44:31.961 --> 44:32.795
<i>Yes.</i>

44:36.632 --> 44:38.467
<i>You knew it could lead
to the need</i>

44:38.551 --> 44:41.554
<i>to have subsequent invasive operations
to try to either...</i>

44:41.971 --> 44:46.058
<i>re... remove or revise
that contracted mesh, correct?</i>

44:46.142 --> 44:47.059
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

44:48.019 --> 44:49.687
<i>As you sit here now,</i>

44:49.770 --> 44:55.318
<i>are there any risks or adverse reactions,
adverse events connected to the Prolift</i>

44:55.401 --> 44:59.614
<i>that medical affairs at Ethicon know of
that were not known at the time of launch?</i>

44:59.697 --> 45:05.411
<i>No. There are no new adverse events that
we were unaware of at the time of launch.</i>

45:06.245 --> 45:09.040
What they did
was willfully ignore the risks

45:09.123 --> 45:11.000
they were putting these women to
without telling them.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.211
And actually, not just not telling them,

45:13.294 --> 45:15.379
but telling them
how safe this was going to be

45:15.463 --> 45:17.590
and how wonderful
this was going to be,

45:17.715 --> 45:19.342
knowing they didn't have
a basis to say that.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.804
People who go to work
in medical device companies,

45:23.888 --> 45:26.682
they're scientists
who actually want to do the right thing.

45:27.099 --> 45:31.395
But if the science or the medicine
isn't jiving with the marketing,

45:31.729 --> 45:34.357
the marketing is always gonna win out,
always.

45:55.920 --> 46:00.091
<i>So it is December 10th, Sunday.</i>

46:00.800 --> 46:05.513
<i>Um, two days before my lumbar puncture
spinal tap.</i>

46:07.014 --> 46:11.269
<i>My daughter, Rayne, is going to drive me
and stay with me there the whole day.</i>

46:12.937 --> 46:15.898
<i>I think they said they do the procedure
around 7:00 a.m.</i>

46:16.816 --> 46:17.692
<i>So, yeah.</i>

46:18.401 --> 46:19.860
<i>Yay, spinal tap.</i>

46:20.361 --> 46:22.530
Coming up soon.Oneida.

46:26.242 --> 46:28.160
Have you ever had
any surgeries done?

46:28.244 --> 46:30.121
- Lots.
- What have you had?

46:30.204 --> 46:32.873
I had a medical device called Essure,

46:32.957 --> 46:35.710
- the new female sterilization.
- Oh, yeah.

46:35.793 --> 46:38.546
Those expelled and got migrated
in my uterus.

46:38.629 --> 46:42.091
I had surgery to remove those,
then I had to have a tubal ligation.

46:42.883 --> 46:44.468
- Um...
- So I guess you're not pregnant.

46:44.552 --> 46:47.430
No, because then, later,
I had to have a hysterectomy

46:47.513 --> 46:50.391
because of the fragments
from the devices that broke.

46:50.474 --> 46:51.475
Get out of town!

46:51.559 --> 46:55.229
Then I had two more surgeries
as I wasn't healing from the hysterectomy.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.732
So they had to repair the vaginal cuff
twice.

46:58.274 --> 47:00.067
- Holy crap!
- Yeah.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.986
Sorry, that's like...

47:02.069 --> 47:05.031
I've had three joint surgeries because...

47:06.032 --> 47:09.535
Essure removal
is the bane of my existence.

47:10.328 --> 47:13.664
We've seen the manufacturer
change the removal protocol,

47:13.748 --> 47:15.124
contradicting themselves

47:15.207 --> 47:18.169
and going back and forth on what's okay
and what's not okay.

47:18.461 --> 47:22.465
Because of that,
a lot of doctors are winging it.

47:22.965 --> 47:27.094
And, unfortunately, breaking them,
pulling them,

47:27.178 --> 47:28.763
cutting them, stretching them.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.182
'Cause If you pull them
or stretch them at all,

47:31.265 --> 47:33.601
it'll fragment and leave pieces behind.

47:34.935 --> 47:36.228
This is what happened to me.

47:36.312 --> 47:39.523
The device ended up breaking
and leaving me with fragments everywhere,

47:39.607 --> 47:41.776
which then set off
my immune system.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.821
Which then set off
a connective tissue disorder

47:45.905 --> 47:47.990
that started deteriorating my joints.

47:49.075 --> 47:51.869
Bayer has admitted that it causes
an autoimmune response

47:51.952 --> 47:53.704
in a small percentage of women.

47:53.788 --> 47:56.665
Um, however,
we don't think it's a small percentage.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.126
Women have all these problems

47:59.585 --> 48:02.380
that seem to have nothing to do
with their pelvic area.

48:03.214 --> 48:06.175
So we started
the Autoimmune After Essure group.

48:07.635 --> 48:09.387
What's just as crazy as that,

48:09.470 --> 48:12.890
we see a really high rate of women
that are becoming pregnant

48:12.973 --> 48:14.767
after being implanted with Essure.

48:15.518 --> 48:18.771
So we've started
a Parents of E-babies group.

48:20.272 --> 48:23.609
We're seeing patterns of health problems
with these babies.

48:24.819 --> 48:29.198
We have seen the device puncture
the amniotic sac and cause preterm labor.

48:30.324 --> 48:31.826
We've seen a lot of loss.

48:33.119 --> 48:36.288
I've seen women have to bury
premature babies.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.291
This is devastation.

48:39.834 --> 48:40.918
Life devastation.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.346
There's nobody paying attention.

48:52.430 --> 48:55.683
We are keeping those records
because nobody else is.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.104
We assume the FDA
has the data that they need

49:00.729 --> 49:04.942
to crack down on manufacturers
that have bad devices

49:05.025 --> 49:07.445
or to recall a product,

49:07.820 --> 49:08.988
and they don't have that.

49:09.071 --> 49:11.073
- They don't?
- They don't have that.

49:11.449 --> 49:14.869
There is a system
for reporting complications...

49:15.327 --> 49:18.914
but there's tremendous underreporting,

49:18.998 --> 49:21.542
because it's a voluntary system.

49:21.625 --> 49:26.672
The FDA has said, "If there's a problem,
just come back to us and let us know."

49:26.964 --> 49:31.051
Well, that reporting system
relies on self-reporting.

49:31.135 --> 49:35.347
There are huge problems
with self-reporting complications.

49:35.431 --> 49:39.560
If a physician observes an adverse event,
they do not have to report it.

49:39.643 --> 49:40.561
The only...

49:41.187 --> 49:45.149
bodies that are required to report
adverse events are the companies.

49:45.232 --> 49:47.610
And the industry is not interested

49:47.693 --> 49:51.071
in having problems with devices
become apparent.

49:51.947 --> 49:54.867
It's estimated
that only three to four percent

49:54.950 --> 49:56.660
of all adverse events...

49:57.036 --> 49:58.871
get reported to the FDA.

49:59.538 --> 50:02.833
A study found
that the worse the outcome was,

50:02.917 --> 50:06.587
the less likely it was
that they would report it to FDA.

50:07.129 --> 50:10.841
So we don't know
about the adverse effects of a new implant

50:10.925 --> 50:14.178
until months or years
after it's on the market.

50:14.261 --> 50:18.390
By then, that may have been put into
hundreds or thousands of people.

50:19.099 --> 50:21.769
Yes. That one.

50:24.563 --> 50:27.650
Here's some examples
of doctors putting in multiple coils.

50:27.733 --> 50:30.736
There's three coils here on this side
and one on this side.

50:31.779 --> 50:34.573
This one is way, way out
of the fallopian tube.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.659
Here's one with six devices.

50:37.451 --> 50:40.913
The doctors are told by the Bayer reps
that come in, who aren't doctors...

50:40.996 --> 50:43.040
Reps come into these rooms
to sell these devices,

50:43.123 --> 50:45.417
and they stand there
and watch you get implanted,

50:45.501 --> 50:48.671
and, if it misfires
and it just gets shot off into the uterus,

50:48.754 --> 50:51.632
they just tell the doctor
to load up another one and try again.

50:51.715 --> 50:56.512
So we're seeing women with five, six,
sometimes eight devices, inside of them,

50:56.595 --> 50:59.014
when you're only supposed
to have one per tube.

51:03.811 --> 51:07.606
Every year,
there's an annual ACOG convention.

51:07.690 --> 51:11.777
And ACOG is
the largest gynecological organization

51:11.860 --> 51:12.820
in the United States,

51:12.903 --> 51:17.074
so there will be thousands
of ob-gyn doctors

51:17.449 --> 51:20.119
at this ACOG convention.

51:20.911 --> 51:23.831
There are so many doctors
that still believe

51:23.914 --> 51:26.000
there are no problems with this device.

51:26.625 --> 51:30.129
Looking at the photos
I think changes their minds.

51:36.969 --> 51:39.847
- There's Holly.
- Hi! How's it going?

51:39.930 --> 51:42.766
I'm Janet, one of the main admins.
Nice to meet you.

51:42.850 --> 51:44.101
- I'm Eva.
- Nice to meet you, Eva.

51:44.184 --> 51:45.269
<i>Oh, there's Angie.</i>

51:45.352 --> 51:46.562
<i>Hi!</i>

51:46.645 --> 51:47.521
Oh, what's up?

51:47.605 --> 51:48.439
<i>Nice shirt.</i>

51:48.522 --> 51:49.481
Yeah, you like it?

51:49.898 --> 51:51.191
<i>I love it. Love it.</i>

51:51.275 --> 51:54.820
Bayer has no data!
Do you have malpractice?

51:55.279 --> 51:58.866
Bayer has no data!
Do you have malpractice?

51:58.949 --> 52:02.453
Bayer has no data!
Do you have malpractice?

52:02.536 --> 52:06.081
Bayer has no data!
Do you have malpractice?

52:06.749 --> 52:09.251
Make sure you tell Bayer
we're out here.

52:09.335 --> 52:11.462
- We're not going.
- Are you giving warning?

52:11.545 --> 52:13.631
What was the biggest problem with them?

52:13.714 --> 52:16.383
- Where do we begin? Chronic inflammation.
- Which part?

52:16.467 --> 52:19.345
Uteruses that are swollen,
two and three times the size.

52:19.428 --> 52:21.180
It's been in the market for...

52:21.263 --> 52:23.057
It's been
in the market 15 years.

52:23.140 --> 52:23.974
Oh, really?

52:24.058 --> 52:27.269
Like I said, I'm putting them in
less than I used to.

52:27.353 --> 52:29.772
- But for some...
- You should never put them in.

52:29.980 --> 52:33.192
You have two doctors here
who've been around long enough to know

52:33.275 --> 52:36.570
that there are complications that occur
all the time,

52:36.654 --> 52:38.864
- in all of medicine and surgery.
- Absolutely.

52:39.031 --> 52:41.283
And it's unfortunate.
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

52:41.909 --> 52:44.286
Are you aware
of all the side effects of Essure?

52:44.370 --> 52:46.789
No, if you do a good job,
you don't have any problem.

52:46.872 --> 52:49.083
- Even if they do a good job...
- No, no.

52:49.166 --> 52:50.376
All those women...

52:50.459 --> 52:51.543
See that sign?

52:51.627 --> 52:55.714
All those names are all hysterectomies
and surgeries and salpingectomies.

52:56.131 --> 52:58.550
It doesn't matter where they're implanted.
They move.

52:58.634 --> 53:01.303
- No, no, they don't.
- They... We have proof.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.722
What happens if there is a complication?

53:03.806 --> 53:08.394
Well, then it goes in the category
of people who have complications.

53:08.477 --> 53:09.937
You remove it, and that's it.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.271
How do you remove it?

53:11.647 --> 53:14.274
You remove it by hysteroscopy.
You put it...

53:14.358 --> 53:16.110
You... you pull it out?

53:16.235 --> 53:19.071
You put an instrument inside,
and you pull it out. You pull.

53:19.154 --> 53:20.572
You cannot do that.

53:20.781 --> 53:21.699
It breaks.

53:23.158 --> 53:24.034
You... you...

53:24.535 --> 53:26.620
You are not a doctor.
You are working...

53:26.704 --> 53:27.913
You are talking like nonsense.

53:27.996 --> 53:30.290
I have 33,000 women
in this group...

53:30.374 --> 53:31.250
No, no, no.

53:31.333 --> 53:32.835
...with over 9,000 surgeries.

53:32.918 --> 53:37.631
I can tell you that we've had fragments
that are unretrieveable.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.049
They cannot get them.

53:42.469 --> 53:43.512
Ah.

53:45.139 --> 53:47.349
Okay, guys, nice to talk to you. Okay?

53:47.641 --> 53:48.559
Good luck.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.689
There's a lot of uncertainty
in medicine.

53:54.314 --> 53:59.111
I think, as physicians, we're not very
good at saying, "We don't know," at times.

53:59.194 --> 54:02.781
It's fine for you
to shout about the benefits

54:02.865 --> 54:05.159
or overstate the benefits of a treatment.

54:05.451 --> 54:07.369
The minute you raise concerns

54:07.453 --> 54:10.372
that something might not be working
as well as it should,

54:10.456 --> 54:13.041
you are often criticized.

54:13.125 --> 54:16.587
You're told
you're unnecessarily scaring patients.

54:17.337 --> 54:22.468
It doesn't seem like doctors
are requiring a high level of evidence

54:22.551 --> 54:25.471
in order to implant a new device.

54:25.554 --> 54:27.806
Yet in order to abandon that device,

54:27.890 --> 54:30.601
they're requiring
a greater level of evidence.

54:30.851 --> 54:34.188
than it took them
to decide to implant the device.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.190
That's turning everything on its head.

54:37.024 --> 54:39.568
We attract good people
in health care,

54:39.860 --> 54:41.904
but there's this tremendous hunger

54:41.987 --> 54:46.533
to have the latest gadgets,
the newest technology,

54:46.617 --> 54:50.120
without the proper evaluation
of that technology.

54:50.871 --> 54:55.292
We shouldn't be surprised
when some of the health care goes wrong.

54:57.461 --> 54:58.587
If I knew this business...

54:59.505 --> 55:01.965
when I got into it X amount of years ago,

55:02.341 --> 55:03.801
I would have done something else.

55:04.635 --> 55:07.596
I worked for one of the largest
medical device companies in the world.

55:07.679 --> 55:12.142
My ultimate job was to make sure that
the surgeons used my implants in surgery.

55:12.643 --> 55:13.727
It's all about usage.

55:14.728 --> 55:18.023
So the more implants you use,
the more money they're going to make.

55:18.106 --> 55:20.275
It's gotten worse over time
because of greed.

55:20.359 --> 55:24.446
Most doctors do the right thing and
always will to the best of their ability.

55:24.530 --> 55:29.201
But some fraction of doctors
respond to the perverse incentives

55:29.284 --> 55:32.246
of getting paid more for the more you do,

55:32.329 --> 55:36.291
regardless of the appropriateness
of that medical care.

55:36.917 --> 55:41.797
There are kickbacks in the United States
today that are entirely legal.

55:41.880 --> 55:45.634
It doesn't have to necessarily be,
"Dr. Jones, I'm giving you money."

55:45.717 --> 55:47.928
It could be consulting,
it could be teaching.

55:48.512 --> 55:50.889
It could be providing money
for a fellowship program.

55:57.688 --> 56:00.649
There's some doctors that are good,
some doctors that aren't.

56:00.899 --> 56:02.943
I had one surgeon recently who said,

56:03.026 --> 56:06.071
"You make the best products,
but you don't do enough for me,

56:06.613 --> 56:08.991
so I'm using somebody else
because they do more for me."

56:10.033 --> 56:11.326
Welcome to the business.

56:16.456 --> 56:20.127
<i>In days gone by,
surgery was all about blood and guts.</i>

56:21.128 --> 56:24.381
<i>In the future,
surgery will be about bits and bytes.</i>

56:25.507 --> 56:27.467
<i>Is the future already here?</i>

56:29.011 --> 56:31.763
<i>It's a blend of science fiction
and medical reality.</i>

56:33.932 --> 56:35.851
<i>The robot will see you now.</i>

56:37.811 --> 56:39.771
<i>Tonight, a story
from the cutting edge.</i>

56:39.855 --> 56:42.024
<i>The million-dollar Da Vinci system,</i>

56:42.107 --> 56:45.110
<i>a revolutionary tool
for surgeries of all kinds.</i>

56:45.193 --> 56:48.530
<i>The Da Vinci is a large,
fairly complicated robot</i>

56:48.614 --> 56:54.536
<i>able to bring a camera and instruments
in together through one small tube.</i>

56:55.078 --> 56:57.122
<i>The Da Vinci is able to reach anywhere</i>

56:57.998 --> 57:00.667
<i>Very exciting to think
where we get to go with this.</i>

57:01.919 --> 57:04.630
Da Vinci allows us
to do remote surgery

57:04.713 --> 57:06.965
from about seven feet away
from the patient.

57:07.549 --> 57:11.595
We work in a remote control console,
sort of like a video game machine.

57:11.720 --> 57:15.015
We look on the screen,
at the image from inside the abdomen.

57:15.515 --> 57:19.144
And we can perform the operation
with remote control hands.

57:19.728 --> 57:24.816
<i>Da Vinci, by Intuitive Surgical.
They're now in 64 countries.</i>

57:24.900 --> 57:28.695
<i>Intuitive is absolutely
the dominant market leader in this field</i>

57:28.779 --> 57:31.698
<i>with a turnover last year
of over $2 billion.</i>

57:31.782 --> 57:33.784
We're an innovative company.

57:33.867 --> 57:36.203
We will continue to innovate,
put new products out.

57:36.286 --> 57:40.624
Intuitive is motivated by the opportunity
to invent new things, create the future.

57:40.707 --> 57:43.669
<i>That is my vision for your future.</i>

57:44.461 --> 57:46.004
<i>Thank you.</i>

57:54.304 --> 57:57.849
The story of how the robot
came into health care

57:57.933 --> 58:02.145
is the story of what's wrong with medicine
in America today.

58:02.646 --> 58:07.567
Massive adoption of a new technology
with little evaluation of the outcomes.

58:17.828 --> 58:21.373
The Da Vinci robot
was marketed with a strategy

58:21.456 --> 58:23.667
of approaching doctors and communities

58:23.750 --> 58:28.171
and telling those doctors,
"We can help drive business to you.

58:29.589 --> 58:32.384
We can market you as the robot doctor."

58:38.181 --> 58:41.101
The robot is better
for certain operations.

58:41.643 --> 58:45.564
But in many situations,
it provides no benefit to the patient,

58:45.647 --> 58:49.818
and it may add operation time
and it may add some risks.

58:52.029 --> 58:53.780
<i>"You need surgery."</i>

58:54.281 --> 58:56.366
<i>Three words no one wants to hear.</i>

58:56.616 --> 59:00.787
<i>This video will explain your surgical
options for a hysterectomy...</i>

59:01.329 --> 59:06.585
Hysterectomies are a very high-volume,
common procedure in the US.

59:06.668 --> 59:11.131
About 500,000 women
have their uterus removed every year.

59:11.882 --> 59:16.219
<i>During a hysterectomy,
doctors remove part or all of the uterus,</i>

59:16.303 --> 59:20.265
<i>the cervix, both fallopian tubes,
and both ovaries.</i>

59:21.558 --> 59:24.895
<i>The surgeon then stitches
the internal opening closed.</i>

59:25.520 --> 59:27.606
<i>If you're told you need a hysterectomy...</i>

59:28.231 --> 59:30.609
<i>ask your doctor about Da Vinci surgery.</i>

59:33.195 --> 59:34.863
I had a biopsy,

59:34.946 --> 59:38.950
and it came back positive
for, um, endometrial cancer.

59:39.409 --> 59:43.246
I was having a lot of female trouble,
a lot of ovarian cysts.

59:43.330 --> 59:45.624
They sent me for a vaginal ultrasound

59:45.874 --> 59:48.835
because we couldn't figure out
why my blood counts were so low,

59:48.919 --> 59:50.545
and I had a tumor.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.799
I was diagnosed with uterine cancer.

59:53.882 --> 59:55.967
I actually was kind of happy,

59:56.051 --> 59:58.762
because I said,
if I have to have cancer anywhere,

59:58.845 --> 01:00:02.516
that's the place to have it,
because I can have it taken out.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.227
The doctor recommended a hysterectomy.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:11.066
And the only type that he said he did
was the Da Vinci.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:16.571
He said, "Well the best way to do this,
the fastest way and the quickest recovery

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:19.282
would be to use the Da Vinci robot."

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.661
It just sounded like the newest,
greatest thing,

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:25.580
and I had no reason to believe otherwise.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:43.265
Originally,
Intuitive Surgical told the FDA

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:46.518
that a huge amount of training
would be provided

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:49.521
as part of the sale of the machine
to the hospitals,

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:53.275
but shortly after
the FDA gave permission to market,

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:57.571
Intuitive scaled back
all of the training requirements.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.658
And the reason is,
if they said, "Your surgeons can use it,

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:05.996
but they need nine weeks of training,"
no one's gonna buy the machine.

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.958
So you have surgeons who

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:16.089
operate for half a day on pigs,
take a ten-question multiple-choice test,

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:20.719
and have a proctor, another surgeon,
watch them do two surgeries,

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:22.971
then they're turned loose
with the machine.

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:28.059
I was told that it takes ten cases
to get good at robotics.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.937
But I know now, in retrospect,

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.773
that I didn't really start
to feel comfortable

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.568
until I was about 200 or 300 cases.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:40.864
In other words, that area
where you'd call yourself proficient.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:45.076
The surgical robot in inexperienced hands

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.581
adds complication or injury rates
to the patient.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:54.544
A lot of surgeons
that shouldn't be using it are using it.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.338
That's the problem.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:02.052
So I had the hysterectomy, go home.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.680
I'm thinking, "Wow, This is smooth, easy."

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:08.767
Within a day or two,
I was running up and down the stairs.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:13.146
And then a couple of weeks later,

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.565
I started to not feel so great.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.862
I was getting up in the morning,
I sat down to go to the bathroom,

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.906
I felt all this pressure.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.532
I looked down

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.243
and this huge...

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.414
pomegranate-looking thing
was protruding from my legs.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:35.335
I think I was actually at my clothesline,
putting something...

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.838
I think I'd washed a load of sheets,
and I heard a pop.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:42.550
I go to the restroom
and I feel something emerge

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.469
from my vagina.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.596
A whoosh of liquid came out.

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:52.602
And now there was about three inches
of my insides coming out of me.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:54.479
I thought I was gonna throw up.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.148
And when I did, I heaved...

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:01.528
and my intestines came down
like halfway to my knees.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.697
I had three feet of my colon fall out.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:07.158
It's in the documentation. So...

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:08.285
I get a towel...

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:10.620
and hold it in.

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:14.291
I run in there, fall out on the floor,
and my husband's like, "What's wrong?"

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:17.085
I said, "My colon's fallen out."
He said, "Let me see."

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:21.214
He saw and then he totally
had a nervous breakdown.

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:34.602
Then, when I got to the hospital,
they didn't know what to do.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.646
They were freaking out.
They'd never seen it.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:39.733
I get to the emergency room,

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:44.279
and I remember thinking so clearly
that I was dead, like this was it.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:47.699
They had to call the specialist,

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:50.577
and he said,
"I don't even know if the surgery...

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.870
I can't say if it'll...

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.581
save her now. I'll do my best."

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.834
I have nightmares about it all the time

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:01.713
where I think I'm on that table,
going into the operating room.

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:04.716
You know, just terrible,
terrible memories of it,

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.218
and it just never seems to leave me.

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.136
It's been...

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.181
what, three years?

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:15.685
And I still have... problems.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:20.982
I have had to give up a dream
of ever having a partner,

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:23.276
of ever being intimate again,

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.362
because, to me, um...

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.156
penetration means death.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.575
It changed the full direction...

01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:32.619
of my life.

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.080
It's taken my life away.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:37.707
I'm sorry I ever heard
the word Da Vinci.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.085
And then, like I said,
every time that I...

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:46.091
hear of more injuries,
it just rubs salt in the wound.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:10.031
Car wash!

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:16.287
After three years of bleeding,

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.123
I ended up having a hysterectomy.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.668
And no more bleeding,
but the pain is still severe.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:25.922
The pain that I had sometimes prevented me
from going to work.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:29.801
And eventually, I lost my job.

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:35.056
I had to do this car wash
because I haven't worked for a month.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.851
My doctor just put me on disability...

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:39.894
which could take months.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.689
So I'm out of income right now.

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:45.191
- Oh, thank you so much.
- That'll help you out.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.444
- Thank you. May God bless you.
- Okay.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.821
I can't afford my rent right now.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.906
So I have to move out,

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:55.785
and if I don't find a place,
and without income and proof of income,

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.829
I can't get an apartment or anything,

01:05:57.912 --> 01:06:00.290
so I'm scared I'm gonna have to be split
with my kids.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.964
Ever since 2011...

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.216
we've moved around a lot.

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:15.472
I don't think we've had one place
that was stable.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.223
Ever.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.101
We don't know
where we're going to be at school.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:24.189
Because we're gonna get another house,

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:26.649
and I don't know
where that house is gonna be.

01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:31.488
My mom can't keep a job
because she has to go to the doctors a lot

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.449
'cause she gets sick a lot,
and it's just...

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:37.994
It ruins her opportunity of having a job.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:42.332
It makes me feel sad
that my mom is at the hospital.

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:19.702
It's tough,
watching her not be able to do stuff.

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:22.705
That much more I have to do.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.374
We used to do it together.

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:30.713
I suck now. I'm just cranky and miserable,
in pain all the time.

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.715
I'm not fun.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:36.803
I can't drink, I can't dance,
I can't do anything.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:41.224
Well...

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.393
But at the same time...

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:47.522
You know,
I'm so grateful for what we have.

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:49.065
We have great kids

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:52.569
and a great house
and we have each other and...

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.029
we're alive.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.907
How does it affect your love life?

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:00.743
Oh... Oh, God.

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:03.037
- It was terrible for a while.
- Yeah.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:05.623
- There was no love life.
- No.

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:07.875
- When I...
- With all the surgeries and stuff.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:10.378
But even when I first had it in,
it was painful.

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:11.296
Yeah.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.716
That part of our life
has been ruined permanently.

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:17.010
It's hard.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.636
Yeah, you don't...
I don't think it ever goes away.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.221
I don't think it ever will.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:26.352
It's sad because I have seen other
people's relationships die in the group.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:29.229
I've seen a lot of women
whose husbands have walked out

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:31.064
- over the intimacy...
- Lots.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.567
...the lack of intimacy.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:38.363
I've seen women suicidal,
women losing their families and...

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.452
thinking that there's no reason
to stay alive.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:51.044
I think it's amazing what she's done...

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:52.754
to help these women.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:57.550
Facebook is a full-time job for her now,
basically.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.135
She wakes up in the morning...

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.803
She's a very determined person.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.514
She gets something in her head,
and that's it.

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:21.240
I started getting random messages
in my Facebook...

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:27.497
from women who started connecting me
with the Gabriella Avina

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.375
that was the spokesperson,
the <i>Ask Gaby.</i>

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.709
They found me...

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:36.089
and said, "Are you the Gaby
that was speaking for Essure?

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.298
Will you talk to us?"

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:39.300
And finally...

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:42.470
uh,
probably about a year of them trying...

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:46.849
one of them said,
"Can you just tell me how your health is?"

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:49.394
And then I listened.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.897
I was fatigued.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:54.315
I was tired all the time.

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:56.484
Then I started falling.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.986
Just... My legs would give out.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:03.241
The doctor said
it was an immune response to something.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:07.870
My story was similar to so many others.

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:10.790
All of a sudden,

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.083
it all made sense.

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:17.880
If only they'd been honest with me
from the very, very beginning.

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:21.092
<i>The Essure procedure
can be performed in your doctor's office</i>

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.094
<i>and is over 99% effective.</i>

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.763
<i>It's 99.74% effective.</i>

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:28.474
<i>It's 99.8% effective.</i>

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:31.686
<i>It's over 99.95% effective.</i>

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.481
It really wasn't tested
for a sufficient amount of time.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:40.903
Most patients that had the Essure device
were followed for about 12-18 months,

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:46.659
and the manufacturer reported
very satisfactory results from it.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:50.663
But for a product that's supposed to be
a lifetime implant,

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:54.625
to cut off the study window
at about a year and a half

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.836
left a lot of questions unanswered.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.964
I was part of the clinical trial

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:03.259
and no one asked me,
"Are you feeling sick?

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:04.802
What is your health like?"

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:08.139
<i>Almost all women
who participated in the clinical studies</i>

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:13.895
<i>rated their satisfaction with Essure
as good, very good or excellent.</i>

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:19.150
The first time I saw the question,
"Rate your comfort of wearing the device,"

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.360
I said, "What does this mean?

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.779
I'm not wearing anything.

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:25.364
This is something
that's implanted inside of my body."

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.950
The nurse said, "Can you feel it?"

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:31.913
I said, "I can feel pain in my abdomen.

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:35.333
Where that pain is coming from,
I don't know."

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.002
And she said,
"Then rate it as excellent."

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.588
They would say,
"Are you happy with the product?"

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:45.551
I would say, "No," and they would say,
"But you're not pregnant?"

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.345
I would say, "Correct."

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:51.015
"Then it's doing its job,
so you have to be happy with that."

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:56.562
The most striking thing is they'd
crossed out answers and changed them

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.689
Where it said I was having pain,

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:02.068
they'd crossed it off
and said, "No pain reported."

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.071
When I questioned Bayer about it,

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.449
they said this is absolutely customary
in a clinical trial.

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:21.003
It turns out

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:24.757
that the vast majority of research
is not coming from an objective source.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:29.887
It used to be
that about 70% of biomedical research

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:31.472
was funded by the government.

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.808
In the last 20, 25 years, that's changed.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:39.063
Now about 70% of biomedical research
is funded by industry.

01:12:39.647 --> 01:12:41.315
They're paying for the research,

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:45.570
so naturally we're going to get
the results that they want to share.

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:50.575
So devices can be on the market for years
and cause many deaths, many injuries

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:52.493
before it becomes public.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:55.204
<i>A medical device
implanted in thousands of people</i>

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.665
<i>that is linked
to more than two dozen deaths...</i>

01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:59.834
<i>During emergency open-heart surgery,</i>

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:02.670
<i>doctors removed
this one-inch piece of metal.</i>

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:04.422
<i>It floated in front of our eyes,</i>

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:08.718
<i>literally, first into the right atrium
and then into the right ventricle.</i>

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.679
<i>Major health concern over breast implants.</i>

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:15.057
<i>They could cause a rare form of cancer.</i>

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:16.851
<i>It may cause other illnesses too.</i>

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:19.937
<i>When she had hers taken out,
they found mold inside,</i>

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:21.272
<i>and she's not alone.</i>

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:25.943
<i>Two dead, 179 exposed
to a dangerous superbug.</i>

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:28.362
<i>A piece of medical equipment
may be to blame.</i>

01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:32.366
<i>A device called a morcellator
as used to shred fibroid tumors.</i>

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.076
<i>so they could be easily removed.</i>

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.788
<i>The shredding ended up
inadvertently spreading the cancer.</i>

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:40.082
<i>A defibrillator was withdrawn
from the market</i>

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:43.210
<i>after 13 deaths
were linked to wiring problems.</i>

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:47.214
<i>The FDA approved this device,
but did not require testing in humans.</i>

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:50.051
<i>We can no longer rely
on the medical device companies</i>

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:52.887
<i>to do what's in the best interest
of the patient.</i>

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:56.515
<i>And we can no longer rely on the FDA</i>

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:59.143
<i>to properly regulate these devices.</i>

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:05.358
I was at the Food and Drug
Administration from 2006 to 2009.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.070
I was the lead gastroenterologist
of devices.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:14.200
I think I cleared,
or was involved in the clearance,

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.119
of over 250-odd devices

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:20.581
I think the vast majority of doctors

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:22.667
and scientists at the FDA...

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:26.420
do their best.
They do it with integrity, honesty.

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:32.593
In mid-2009, a file came on my desk
to look at this CT scanner,

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:37.098
this device that affects
many millions of people in our country.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:42.061
A CT scan takes the equivalent
of hundreds and hundreds of X-rays.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.480
while a machine rotates around your body.

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:49.276
They're an incredibly good test
for diagnosing a range of diseases

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.863
that gives you
very sophisticated 3-D images.

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:57.535
But the doses of radiation
that we use day in and day out for CT

01:14:57.618 --> 01:15:00.955
are in the range that we know
it will cause cancer in some people.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:05.292
And yet, the use of CT scanning
has quadrupled in the last 15 years.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:13.843
The elephant in the room

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.846
is it's a very profitable
part of the health care system.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:20.683
It's a way a lot of radiologists,
emergency departments, hospitals

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:21.600
make money

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:24.645
There's a lot of excess use
of this device,

01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:30.192
and so I simply said,
"We should have a warning on the FDA label

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:31.652
just to warn the doctor...

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:36.282
and therefore the patient,
that actually if you use this device...

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.535
and certainly if you use it repeatedly...

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:41.996
your risk of cancer

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:45.249
or developing
abdominal cancer will increase.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.377
I couldn't believe the pushback I'd got

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:51.464
from managers with no medical experience.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:55.092
There was a group of FDA physicians

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:59.513
who were very concerned about the way
products were being cleared and approved.

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:02.183
We took these concerns

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:05.269
up the chain of command to Jeffrey Shuren,

01:16:05.352 --> 01:16:09.023
the director
of the Center for Medical Devices at FDA.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.400
And what did he do?

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:14.487
He not only did nothing,
he took it one step further.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.073
He retaliated against people.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:20.201
Once we started complaining...

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:25.915
FDA put their spy software
in our computers.

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:31.378
And they were monitoring
all our activities.

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:35.925
The FDA installed
what's called Spector software

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:40.096
onto a number of physicians'
and scientists' computers,

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:44.850
and it allowed them to capture screenshots
every two seconds...

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.560
and keystrokes.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:53.484
It's as if to say their own doctors
are somehow criminals for exposing...

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:57.071
a public health issue.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:02.368
It left a tremendous chill
amongst the FDA scientists.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:19.385
Listen, safety's as important to us
as it is to anybody else.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:23.389
None of us want a product on the market
that's not safe, right?

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.267
That's why we rely on regulators
to help us get there.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:28.853
I think the US regulatory system
works well.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:31.772
It's robust, it's thorough,
and it's been very effective.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:34.358
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:38.779
<i>please welcome president and CEO
of AdvaMed, Scott Whitaker.</i>

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.451
The device industry
is very well represented

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.662
by their main lobbying group, AdvaMed.

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:48.372
<i>Good afternoon, everyone,</i>

01:17:48.455 --> 01:17:51.458
<i>and welcome to the Global Summit
for Medical Technology.</i>

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.378
<i>This is a room full of disruptors.</i>

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:57.673
<i>We are risk-takers of the highest order.</i>

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:02.678
<i>Not enough Americans understand
the important role we play,</i>

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:06.432
<i>or frankly give us enough credit
for the innovation we bring.</i>

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:09.602
<i>Sure, we'll pay attention to Washington.</i>

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.770
<i>That's my job. That's what I do.</i>

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:16.734
<i>But we have more power in this room
than most governments around the world.</i>

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:20.112
<i>We have the ability
to create jobs and prosperity...</i>

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:24.742
<i>to open and expand markets
and unleash innovation.</i>

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:28.871
<i>Let's show the world that we are
what's next.</i>

01:18:38.339 --> 01:18:39.882
They have lobbied hard

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:44.678
to see the standards for approval
of devices watered down over the years.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:48.766
Device companies
unleash armies of lobbyists

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.893
in order to influence politicians.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:54.104
And these politicians are vulnerable.
They don't know science.

01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:57.107
It's often very flowery
and impressive language

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:59.151
about how they put patients first

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.570
and they want only the best.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:05.866
We want to make sure that new
medical innovations get to patients

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:09.411
and help save lives,
improve the human condition,

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:12.456
eliminate suffering,
and make this world a better place,

01:19:12.539 --> 01:19:13.999
That's what we all agree on, right?

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:16.168
The medical device industry

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.712
has incredible levels of influence
in Washington, D.C.

01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:21.048
They have provided dark money
contributions

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:24.301
that are used to secretly fund
political campaigns.

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:28.555
Medical device companies also fund
think tanks and patient advocacy groups

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.808
that can go to Congress
and make the case for them.

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:34.770
Perhaps an even worse problem
is the revolving door.

01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:39.358
A number of FDA officials
have both come from industry

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.194
and then go back to industry
after they're at FDA.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.947
When they go to work for the companies,

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.199
they can tell the companies all the tricks

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:51.245
of how to get around FDA regulations,
how to get what you want.

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:55.374
Almost all the heads at the FDA
went on to work for industry.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:39.418
<i>President Donald Trump
says he's picked a nominee</i>

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.503
<i>to run the Food and Drug Administration.</i>

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:45.591
<i>Dr. Scott Gottlieb is a popular choice
in the pharmaceutical industry.</i>

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:48.802
<i>"Thank God it's Gottlieb," said
an investment analyst at Robert Baird.</i>

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:50.596
<i>Why would they have that reaction?</i>

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.933
<i>They were breathing a sigh of relief.
He's a known entity in the industry.</i>

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:56.894
I've known Scott
for a long time.

01:20:56.977 --> 01:20:57.811
He took that job

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:01.565
because he wants to do what's in the best
interest of the American people

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:05.027
and the agency, and not what's
in the best interest of anyone else.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:10.783
Gottlieb has been a consultant
to a range of medical industries.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:13.077
He's also worked
at a venture capital firm

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.623
that actually specializes in investing
in start-up medical device companies.

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:20.876
<i>I'm proud of my relationship
with New Enterprise Associates.</i>

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.462
<i>It's been one of the premier
venture capital firms in the country,</i>

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.255
<i>starting a lot of innovative ventures.</i>

01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:28.842
<i>Over the time that I was there,
they invested about $14 billion</i>

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:30.469
<i>in 500 different companies.</i>

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:39.144
<i>You have spent
your life entrenched in the companies</i>

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:42.356
<i>that would benefit
from looser regulations.</i>

01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.858
<i>But I think it raises
the very real question</i>

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:50.572
<i>of whether someone who seems to oppose
the FDA's basic safety mission</i>

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:52.533
<i>should be running the agency.</i>

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:07.131
I can tell you he doesn't have any bias
as a result of that.

01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:09.842
I've never seen it
and don't expect to see it,

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.802
knowing him the way I do.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:28.444
The FDA is supposed to protect
the public interest.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:33.115
Unfortunately, their behavior shows
that they have been captured by industry.

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:35.534
<i>Scott, thank you for coming
across the country</i>

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.661
<i>to participate with us at this conference.</i>

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.080
<i>I speak, I think, for the entire industry.</i>

01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:42.249
<i>Where we were five years ago at the FDA</i>

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:44.751
<i>compared to where we are today
is night and day.</i>

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:47.880
<i>And I think your leadership
has made a huge difference</i>

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:49.882
<i>and we are really grateful for that.</i>

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:57.014
In 25 years,
we will, I think, be worse off.

01:22:57.097 --> 01:23:00.517
All the legislation we're seeing,
again, driven by lobbying from industry,

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:01.727
is moving in the wrong direction

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:04.938
and there's no evidence
that's gonna shift.

01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:09.610
<i>I just came out of a briefing
with senior officials at the White House</i>

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:13.614
<i>about the executive order that
President Trump will sign this morning.</i>

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.741
We issued an order which says,

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:20.954
for every one new regulation,
two old regulations must be eliminated.

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:25.417
"Regulation is bad. Let's cut regulations.

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:29.004
For every regulation,
we're going to cut umpteen regulations."

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:30.297
That bravado...

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:33.050
may apply to certain fields,

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:36.553
but it can't and shouldn't apply

01:23:36.637 --> 01:23:40.516
when you're talking about
putting a device in someone's body.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.022
<i>We're very proud of this one.</i>

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.442
I'm gonna leave.
I need to go find a place.

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:52.486
Mom!

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:01.828
You ready?

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:10.837
We are going to go try to find a hotel

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.674
that will take us all in
with a reasonable price.

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:16.927
And call it a day, I guess.

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:24.226
Mom, there's a homeless over there.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.394
I know, baby.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:28.438
You see, girls? It could always be worse.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:32.067
He probably doesn't have a car or anything
and we do have a car.

01:24:40.033 --> 01:24:41.034
Does he know us?

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:44.246
- Does he know us?
- No. Okay.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:47.708
Hi. How much is it for a two-bed?

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:49.751
- 110 for one night?
- Yeah.

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:52.963
Do you have weekly discounts
or anything like that?

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.549
Nothing right now.

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:00.387
Give me a second, okay?

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:09.980
- So it's 110.
- 110 and a private room.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:22.284
- Are you guys happy?
- Yeah.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:23.285
Yeah.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.458
Go.

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.128
It's really tiny.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.220
So I guess we're home.

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:44.556
For a night.

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:02.866
Familiar faces.

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:07.204
Nice to meet you in person.

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:08.121
Claudia.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:09.748
Janet.

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.124
Yes, Janet, how are you?

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:12.167
Good, how are you?

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.044
You're Marilyn, right?

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.380
- And you are...?
- April.

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:19.966
Oh, my God!

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:21.927
- Surreal.
- My God, you guys.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.304
I want to thank everybody for coming.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:28.809
It's just amazing
to finally see all of you.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:31.812
So let's start off
by maybe just going around,

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:34.147
just say who you are
and where you're from.

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:37.776
My name is Alicia Perry.
I am from Stockton.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:43.657
I am an implantee,
I'm just going to say it, for ten years.

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:47.619
No longer. And I'm so glad
to see everyone here. Thank you.

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:50.997
I'm Juanita Nunez-Archuleta.
I know it's long.

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:53.917
I'm an admin on the Spanish page

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.086
and I am E-free, seven months.

01:26:56.586 --> 01:27:00.632
I'm Gaby Avina
and I'm from Martinez, California.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:03.802
I was one
of the clinical trial participants,

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:09.683
so I had mine implanted in 2000,
and I had mine taken out in 2014.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:16.273
I don't know if any of you were familiar
with the <i>Ask Gaby </i> website...

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:19.943
that was on Conceptus
and Essure's website.

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.111
That was me.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:22.571
I was a spokesperson.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:27.367
I failed thousands of women
for seven years.

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:30.245
It's a long time to tell women
that a product is great.

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:32.998
So the guilt that you live with...

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.376
and the pain...

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:42.758
and just crazy feelings of responsibility

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:43.967
because of that.

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:50.515
Thank you for being
on this side now

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:54.770
because it's important
that people now see the damage

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:57.606
and more and more doctors
are starting to see it.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:58.690
Very validating.

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:06.782
We just want to have a discussion
and brainstorm.

01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:09.409
What should our new media push be
right now?

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:13.663
I felt good about it
'cause I saw women that came together

01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:15.707
to fight for what they believe in.

01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:18.210
They're strong, they're smart women,

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:20.420
and they're getting the media to listen.

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:24.466
<i>It was supposed to be safer
and less invasive.</i>

01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:27.886
<i>Why are so many people complaining
about a popular birth control device?</i>

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.304
<i>Pain, back pain.</i>

01:28:29.387 --> 01:28:31.515
<i>It was debilitating. I could barely walk.</i>

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:34.351
<i>I never thought
I would be looking at a hysterectomy...</i>

01:28:35.101 --> 01:28:35.936
<i>at 29.</i>

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:37.521
<i>My body is just devastated.</i>

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:41.441
<i>Damaged, they say,
by a birth control device called Essure.</i>

01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:45.028
The stories started getting out
in the news and then other news stations

01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:49.074
started seeing the other stories and were
like, "Okay, let's do this in our area."

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.743
<i>Five heart-wrenching stories
of extreme physical pain.</i>

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:54.746
<i>Six women with severe medical problems.</i>

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:58.875
<i>Thousands of women like Becky
are sharing their experiences on Facebook.</i>

01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:02.254
There are now
35,000 members in the group.

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:04.881
We've set up groups in other countries.

01:29:04.965 --> 01:29:08.051
We found women in Italy,
willing to take over the page.

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:09.886
We started the Netherlands group.

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.724
We had women from France.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.894
They're all branches of us.

01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:22.816
So we've got 11 subgroups
that are other countries.

01:29:23.942 --> 01:29:25.944
<i>A controversial birth control device</i>

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.530
<i>in the US is going off the market
in Europe.</i>

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:31.575
<i>Bayer announced
it is pulling out of the European market</i>

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:33.326
<i>due to a lack of interest.</i>

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:36.580
<i>But a spokesperson says,
"Bayer's decision</i>

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:41.126
<i>does not impact the sale or marketing
of the product in the United States</i>

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.461
<i>where there continues to be demand,</i>

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:46.548
<i>despite the recent inaccurate
and biased reporting."</i>

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:49.009
That's bullshit.

01:29:55.015 --> 01:29:59.269
The equivalent of the FDA in Europe
asked Bayer to provide more safety data.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:03.231
And Bayer, at that point, decided
to withdraw it from the market.

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:05.609
It's very frustrating.

01:30:08.194 --> 01:30:11.156
Our group has been fighting
in our country for the longest.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.659
Yet we're the ones
with it still on the market.

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:20.457
Bayer has no incentive
to take it off the market here.

01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:26.046
Nobody's holding the manufacturer
accountable.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:29.132
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, honey. Knock 'em dead.

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:34.387
We're not gonna stop
until it's off the market.

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:46.983
The FDA isn't doing anything,
the manufacturer's not doing anything.

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:50.278
We need to push Congress
to force the hand of the FDA.

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:55.700
So this device
is still being inserted in women?

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:57.953
- In the United States...
- In the US?

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:01.498
September 18th, it came
off the market everywhere else.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:04.709
Look at how far up
the injury and death reports go now.

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:06.836
Because they're not being held liable,

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.298
they don't have any incentive
to take these devices off the market.

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:14.344
People are getting harmed and injured,
and nobody's doing anything about it.

01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:18.723
We have many, many women
who are ending up with fragments

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:21.434
and massive issues and re-surgeries.

01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:24.145
- Women just seem to be expendable.
- Yes.

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:27.440
That's how we're starting to feel.
We're disposable.

01:31:27.524 --> 01:31:30.986
The FDA has been very clear that they're
not going to take this off the market.

01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:33.905
That this is the manufacturer's
responsibility

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:35.865
I know of no possible reason,

01:31:35.949 --> 01:31:40.829
when they are chosen to protect
the health of the people of this country,

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:43.123
that they would choose to go
in the other direction

01:31:43.206 --> 01:31:45.041
and protect the manufacturers.

01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:46.668
That's gotta be changed.

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:53.925
I wanted to get as much information as
I can with the various personal stories.

01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:57.429
I don't know
how many of those that you have.

01:31:58.054 --> 01:31:58.888
A lot.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:00.640
- Thousands.
- Tens of thousands.

01:32:00.724 --> 01:32:01.975
Tens of thousands, okay.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:05.520
This place works
with good people on the inside

01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:08.398
trying to maneuver
and push legislation forward.

01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:12.318
The way it really works
is the external pressure.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:16.990
And that's all of you
and you are in great numbers out there.

01:32:17.991 --> 01:32:19.075
Welcome to the NFL.

01:32:20.618 --> 01:32:22.662
You just cannot get tired.

01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:25.999
It is a continuous effort.

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:28.585
We won't stop.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:31.087
They've already taken away my health.

01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:33.256
What else can they take from me?

01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:35.050
I have nothing to fear from them.

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:37.427
This has to come to an end.

01:32:38.011 --> 01:32:40.472
I don't know how anyone with a conscience

01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:43.808
and any sort of compassion
could let this continue to happen.

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:15.340
I go to work...

01:33:16.216 --> 01:33:17.133
and I'm at work...

01:33:17.217 --> 01:33:18.426
Right.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:21.179
...and those issues aren't with me...

01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:25.141
until you think about it
and think about it for an extended time.

01:33:25.975 --> 01:33:27.560
We're insulated from...

01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:29.521
the horror.

01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:34.734
It's the first time
I've really heard him say

01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:38.780
that much detail about how he feels
about what we're feeling.

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:42.200
- It's hard for the men to talk about.
- Right.

01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:44.994
This is a safe place for us.

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:46.412
That's right.

01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:48.665
I've probably talked to close to...

01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:53.169
I can't even begin to think of the number
of women that have called me.

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:57.507
And the only good thing
is knowing that I'm not alone.

01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:12.272
Please help me welcome Dr. Steve Tower.

01:34:16.526 --> 01:34:19.112
<i>The take-home message today</i>

01:34:19.195 --> 01:34:24.784
<i>is that systemic cobalt poisoning
from a hip replacement...</i>

01:34:25.577 --> 01:34:26.786
<i>is a common problem.</i>

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:31.124
<i>You could make a strong argument
that everyone would be better off</i>

01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:34.836
<i>if we stopped innovating
in total hip replacement</i>

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:38.590
<i>and stuck with what's been around
for 30 years,</i>

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:40.633
<i>and we know there's designs...</i>

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:54.981
Bye.

01:34:55.899 --> 01:34:57.734
I love you.

01:34:57.817 --> 01:34:58.776
Behave, okay?

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.528
- Bye, Liz.
- Bye.

01:35:00.904 --> 01:35:03.156
- Love you, behave, okay?
- Okay.

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:04.073
Bye.

01:35:07.744 --> 01:35:08.578
Bye.

01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:09.913
Okay.

01:35:09.996 --> 01:35:10.997
Behave, okay?

01:35:11.497 --> 01:35:13.541
- Okay, well.
- All right.

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.376
- Thank you, Ms. Kelly.
- Yeah, okay.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.086
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:52.473
Relax.
