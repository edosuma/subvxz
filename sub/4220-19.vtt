WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.835
I heard back from
Doctor Gochman.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.420
I'm cleared for Squad.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.506
This job took Dad. It
messed with your health...

00:06.590 --> 00:07.965
And you keep going back
for more.

00:08.092 --> 00:11.344
Can we just put us on hold?
Maybe then we can start anew?

00:11.428 --> 00:12.595
Yeah, I'd like that.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.180
How's New York?
Good.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.099
I just, uh,
needed a little breather.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.183
What's the real reason?

00:17.267 --> 00:20.019
What, I can't take a
vacation, come back and
hang with my little brother?

00:20.104 --> 00:22.105
I'm glad that we reconnected.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.400
The thing is,
when I look at you,
I see that guy.

00:25.484 --> 00:28.778
The one who shut me out.
Well, this guy is sorry,

00:58.809 --> 00:59.809
Over here!

01:00.227 --> 01:01.227
Hurry up!

01:01.353 --> 01:02.478
Gas leak?

01:02.563 --> 01:05.148
Yeah. We use anhydrous
ammonia as a refrigerant.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.567
The line broke.
You can't breathe in there!

01:08.068 --> 01:10.820
All employees are accounted
for but Scooter and Brad
are trapped on the roof!

01:10.904 --> 01:11.946
Hey! Hey! Help!

01:12.072 --> 01:14.741
Main, gonna need a Level One
Hazmat Response.
Copy that.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.535
Casey, need your ladder up
on the roof. Masks on...

01:17.619 --> 01:18.828
You heard him. Let's go!

01:36.096 --> 01:37.555
We're about eight feet short.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.183
On it! Get the 10-foot down.
Yeah.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.188
Got it.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.796
Hey! Casey, you all right?

02:09.880 --> 02:11.047
I'm awake now!

02:12.049 --> 02:14.759
Hey, ammonia explosion
like that produces
very little fire.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.053
We are gonna wait for
Hazmat to breach, boys.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.971
It's too dangerous.
Come on down.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.932
Hey, Chief, we can get
the workers
on the roof.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.391
At least let us do that.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.354
Okay. Two minutes.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.919
Hey, we got to get
off this roof!

02:50.087 --> 02:53.130
Otis, Herrmann! Come help us
get them down.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.924
Copy that.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.037
Nearest ambo is
five minutes out.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.290
Chief, victims are
in respiratory distress.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.834
Uh, we can load two
or three into the Squad.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.919
We'll head to Chicago Med
and help offload.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.380
Okay. Mills, call ahead.
Tell them that their day
is gonna be a whole

03:34.464 --> 03:36.299
hell of a lot busier.

03:42.598 --> 03:45.099
Hey. Hi. Morning.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.642
Melanie.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.270
Jay. Will's brother.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.523
It's nice to meet you.
Yeah.

03:59.823 --> 04:03.075
When do you have to
be at work?
Ten minutes ago.

04:03.994 --> 04:04.952
It's your first day.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.371
Uh, first and last as
it turns out. Almond milk.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.665
You don't have any regular
milk in here.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.168
You're joking.
No.

04:13.962 --> 04:14.921
I got to get back.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.381
To what? I thought the
partners kicked you out
of the practice.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.718
They did, but...
Now this may come as a shock
to you,

04:21.011 --> 04:22.929
there are other practices
in New York City.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.681
Hey, how about for once,
you see something all
the way through.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.808
Wow. You sound like
the old man.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.312
There it is. I mean,
that is why you're blowing
back out of town, right?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.856
What do you care?

04:36.026 --> 04:39.195
Just give it a couple
weeks, at least.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.447
You never know.

04:42.991 --> 04:43.991
I got to go.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.967
Oh, lord,
here it comes... Um...

05:01.051 --> 05:03.928
April, we have at least
thirty inhalation victims
minutes out.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.931
Who've inhaled what?
Chlorine? Skunk weed?

05:07.057 --> 05:09.558
Um...
Ask next time.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.060
Okay.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.270
Have you seen Doctor Tramble
or the new guy?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.064
No.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.414
When I took this job
I didn't know we did our own
maintenance work.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.084
I have a theory.
Goodwin likes
broken appliances

05:35.168 --> 05:37.795
'cause it means we
have to spend more money
at the vending machines.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.922
The great vending
machine conspiracy.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.466
You could get published
in JAMA with that.

05:50.559 --> 05:53.269
Nice work.
Hannah.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.398
I know who you are,
Doctor Tramble.
Will Halstead.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.276
I am, by the way.
What?

06:00.610 --> 06:01.610
Published.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.030
Shared credit with
three other doctors.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.781
Uh, published
is published, April.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.616
We're about to get slammed.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.916
Anhydrous ammonia victims.
Thirty more coming.
Put him in three.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.460
Where to?
This one in seven.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.006
What's going on?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.632
Industrial ammonia leak.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.970
Thirty plus are on their
way here and we're already
full up with flu patients.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.222
Round up as many O2
tanks as you can find.
Hmm-mmm.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.390
Hey, can you
help this guy?

06:33.143 --> 06:36.312
Sharon Goodwin?
Doctor Will Halstead.
Yeah, yeah.
We met at the interview.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.106
About that...
Yeah, I'm late for
a meeting, doctor.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.274
Enjoy your first day.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.445
Oh, that's what I wanted
to talk to you... About.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.239
I'm gonna run over to
urgent care, discharge as
many as I can

06:47.324 --> 06:50.534
to free up the space.
You start getting them sorted
and we'll go from worst

06:50.619 --> 06:52.828
to I'm-not-gonna-die-today.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.295
Kendra?
Kelly...

07:03.131 --> 07:04.340
Hope you guys ate a
big breakfast.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.967
We're gonna have to start
doubling up bays

07:07.052 --> 07:09.303
and separate the flu patients
from the gas victims.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.515
Everyone, may I have
your attention, please.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.183
Can I have your
attention?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.228
Listen up!

07:21.900 --> 07:24.110
All right. We are going
to have a very
full day here.

07:25.028 --> 07:28.697
And I understand none
of you feel well, but we're
gonna need help from you

07:28.865 --> 07:30.366
as well as patience.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.202
If you're here because of
the ammonia leak,
I'm gonna need you

07:33.370 --> 07:35.121
on this side of the
room when I say so.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.124
If you're here because of
the flu or something
non-life threatening,

07:38.208 --> 07:41.210
I'm gonna... Sir.
Not yet, please...
I need everyone...

07:41.294 --> 07:45.673
If you thought
Ebola was a nightmare,
I am the apocalypse!

07:47.259 --> 07:52.012
Death to all Americans!
You're all dead in two
weeks. Allahu Akbar!

08:11.199 --> 08:13.576
Casey? What the hell happened?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.418
Dawson. You okay?

08:22.961 --> 08:24.044
Yeah, I'm okay.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.797
What'd he say?
The bomber?

08:27.257 --> 08:29.508
Something about being worse
than Ebola.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.930
We need to lock down
the ER. No one in or out! Now!

08:35.724 --> 08:37.600
Herrmann?
Nobody leaves!

08:37.726 --> 08:39.018
Jesus.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.477
Chief, some guy just
blew himself up.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.229
Said what he has is worse
than Ebola...

08:42.772 --> 08:46.066
We need everyone
brought back in.
They could be infected.

08:46.484 --> 08:51.113
Lock it all down!
No one in or out!
Tony! Cruz!

08:51.198 --> 08:54.116
Use the rigs,
block out the exits!
Stop these people leaving!

08:54.201 --> 08:56.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No one leaves! I need
you back inside!

08:56.244 --> 08:57.286
No way!

08:57.412 --> 08:59.455
Stay there! Right there!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

08:59.539 --> 09:01.123
Nobody leaves! Nobody!
Hey, stop! Stop! Stop!

09:01.208 --> 09:02.791
I got him! I got him!
Hold on. Hold on.

09:02.918 --> 09:03.918
Stop! Stop!

09:04.211 --> 09:05.461
Hey!

09:07.672 --> 09:10.049
Stop! I need you to
turn around and
go back inside!

09:22.812 --> 09:26.732
Otis, find extinguishers and
get on that ceiling fire.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.735
Mills, Brett okay?
All in one piece, Lieutenant.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.737
Look for injuries.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.501
We don't know
what it is. All right?

09:45.669 --> 09:47.169
If the doctor says
you got to stay,
you got to stay.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.796
Hey! I'm sorry, but no one in
or out until we know

09:48.880 --> 09:49.964
what we're dealing with.
Come on.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.508
You heard him! All right?
Listen, please,

09:52.592 --> 09:55.844
just sit up against
the wall and wait!

09:56.179 --> 09:58.555
Tell the firefighters they can
start bringing the
stragglers back inside,

09:58.682 --> 10:00.975
including the firemen.
And don't let anyone out.
Got it.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.019
Hey, we need to set
up a decontamination area.
Any bathroom with a shower.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.021
Start getting
people washed off.
Got it.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.190
Hey, hey! Over here!
It's Severide!

10:08.275 --> 10:11.568
Hey. Kelly!
Kelly, you hear me?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.408
It's a...
It's a weak pulse...

10:17.867 --> 10:20.995
Trauma to his back and
chest. He's got shrapnel
from the grenade.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.955
Let me see.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.083
Nah. Black tag him. He's gone.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.252
What?
Percentages are very low
that he'll...

10:28.336 --> 10:29.920
I don't give
a damn about percentages.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.215
Uh, no problem...
Grab a gurney.

10:36.011 --> 10:39.054
Chief, Severide took
a hit from the explosion.
Seems pretty bad.

10:39.139 --> 10:44.268
Doc wanted to black tag him.
Okay, keep me in the loop.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.687
Slowly start walking backward,
toward the truck.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.108
One, two, three.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.529
Trauma bay four.
Get him on oxygen and start
cutting off the jacket but

10:55.613 --> 10:57.323
wait to uncover the wound.
I'll be right there.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.490
All right.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.245
Hey, guys, I need the room.
Come on, come on.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.043
Look at me right here.
What's your name?

11:09.127 --> 11:10.669
You know my name...
I'm the one that helped
you with...

11:10.754 --> 11:12.004
I know that I know
your name.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.297
I'm making sure that
you know it.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.926
April.
All right. You might have
a mild concussion, April.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.262
Can you sit here a moment
until I can take
a look at you?

11:20.347 --> 11:24.183
Okay. April Layton Sexton,
born November 22, 1982.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.061
My fifth grade teacher
was Mrs. Nagel.
My first pet was Bubbles.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.937
We're good.
Okay. Good.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.857
I'm gonna go
help people now.
Okay.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.865
Herrmann. There's another
extinguisher by the doors.

11:42.452 --> 11:46.330
You can't come in, lady!
We got a situation!
Open these doors!

11:46.623 --> 11:48.123
Hit the bricks!

11:49.834 --> 11:51.502
You can't come in.
You need a surgeon
in there.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.337
I'm a surgeon. And you
need a Hazmat suit...

11:53.421 --> 11:54.963
I'm gonna operate in a
Hazmat suit?

11:55.048 --> 11:58.967
Open this door, New York!
Come on!

12:02.347 --> 12:04.681
Firefighter. Trauma Bay four.
Do what you can.
Got it.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.892
Thank you ladies
and gentlemen for stopping.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.812
Now I'm gonna ask you
for your patience.
Okay?

12:12.315 --> 12:13.524
Excuse me, sir!

12:14.943 --> 12:18.654
Everyone who was inside when
the grenade went off needs
to go back inside the ER.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.658
I, uh, I, I wasn't
inside. I was, I was...

12:24.411 --> 12:26.036
Taking a nap.
Did you say grenade?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.913
Yes. We are containing
the area.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.082
Can you go beyond the
designated area over here?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.750
Uh, Chief, uh...
It's "Chief," right?

12:31.835 --> 12:33.836
You see that gentleman right
over there.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.713
With the, uh,
the blood on his face.

12:37.340 --> 12:40.509
That expression,
that's what we call
a "target stare."

12:41.052 --> 12:43.679
You know, hands between
his hips and his torso,

12:44.347 --> 12:46.515
his leg cocked back at
a 45 degree angle...

12:46.850 --> 12:48.851
Well, that's, uh, a pretty
surefire indication

12:48.935 --> 12:53.021
someone's about to
get aggressive. I just...
Wanted to let you know.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.440
You can't keep us here.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.817
Please, sir?
Yeah. Who's in charge here?

12:56.901 --> 12:59.820
I am. You need to
go back inside.
This way, sir.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.822
You can't do this!
I got the right to leave!

13:01.906 --> 13:04.116
We have a containment
situation, sir.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.826
And we got a terrorist
attack here is
what we got!

13:05.910 --> 13:07.202
And we don't know
what's coming next!

13:07.287 --> 13:09.037
Now get the hell out
of my way.
Hey!

13:09.122 --> 13:11.957
Look, you...
You can't make us stay!
You don't have the authority!

13:12.041 --> 13:15.878
Authority is the
one thing I do have.
Now back inside!

13:16.004 --> 13:18.797
You want to leave, man?
Yeah, you're damn
right I do!

13:18.882 --> 13:21.133
That's 'cause you're scared,
right? You're, you're
confused, right?

13:21.217 --> 13:22.468
You just want to take off.
I'm not scared.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.803
I am. I'm terrified, man.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.013
I wasn't even in there.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.724
I got to tell you,
I got a lot of respect

13:28.850 --> 13:30.309
for the way you're
handling yourself right now.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.895
I mean, frankly, as a,
as a fellow citizen,
I'm proud of you.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.231
And you know that,
that all these,
these nice folks,

13:36.316 --> 13:38.192
they're looking at you
to do the right thing, right?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.404
Am I gonna get to
leave or not?

13:42.989 --> 13:46.241
I wouldn't want to get
everybody sick. You want
to get everybody sick?

13:47.494 --> 13:50.662
Of course not.
Yeah, so, so you want
to do the right thing.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.957
That's great. All I know
is that if these men,

13:54.083 --> 13:58.003
they say that the best thing
is for you to be inside,

13:58.087 --> 14:01.298
then that is...
That's the best thing.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.395
All right, man.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.190
Okay, everybody
back inside! Please.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.860
Thank you.
He's not done.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.655
Who the hell are you?

14:25.782 --> 14:28.534
I'm Doctor Charles,
the head of Psychiatry.
I'll be around.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.955
Come on in, folks.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.667
Please, have a seat
against this wall.
Thank you...

14:37.627 --> 14:39.711
Do we have an infectious
disease specialist on
the premises?

14:40.088 --> 14:42.005
Diane Claman.
Good. Call her.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.383
Tell her to get down here
right now, full Hazmat.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.468
We got to know what
we're dealing with...

14:57.272 --> 14:59.064
Tell me you're
not in there.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.400
I am. Listen, the guy
who blew himself up in here

15:01.484 --> 15:03.235
said he had something
worse than Ebola...

15:03.987 --> 15:06.321
What, like he's spreading it
with this?
Yeah.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.907
Every single one of us
in here has been in
contact with him.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.118
Who was he?
No idea.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.120
Do us all a favor
and find out, would you?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.667
Doctor!

15:19.168 --> 15:21.670
His airway's clear.
He's breathing.
Circulation's good.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.714
His name's Jim.
Can you hear me, Jim?

15:23.798 --> 15:24.756
Yes.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.883
Is that... Is that...
That's his rib, right?

15:30.054 --> 15:34.016
That's someone's ulna. His.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.189
Let's run an IV
with antibiotics, and I need
some gauze, tape, bandages,

15:41.274 --> 15:42.774
and a cast saw.
I'm on it.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.318
I'll help.
What? A saw?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.446
What are you doing?
Jim, I'm gonna need you
to remain

15:47.530 --> 15:48.655
as still as you can.

15:53.911 --> 15:57.372
Dammit, his SATs are dropping.
Start bagging while
I dress the wound.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.380
Check patient.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.140
Kelly!

16:19.187 --> 16:22.564
...that we promise to be
there for each
other, always. No matter what.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.984
Check patient.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.445
We need to intubate, now!

16:38.247 --> 16:40.415
Pushing 20 milligrams
of etomidate.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.167
Intubating.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.091
- I can't find the chords.
- Come on, you got this.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.301
Take a deep breath and
pull straight up.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.101
Check patient.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.728
All right, I got it.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.029
Check patient.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.583
He's stabilizing.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.795
Okay, listen to me.
We got to get a chest tube
in and make sure

17:26.879 --> 17:28.422
these other
wounds didn't do more damage.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.631
Whatever you say.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.144
Look at us, patching up people
with band-aids

17:42.228 --> 17:44.646
while our insides might be
throwing in the white
towel...

17:44.814 --> 17:47.649
Yeah, well, there's nothing
we can do about it now.
Yeah.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.405
We do our jobs,
we help these people.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.116
Don't let the rest of it
mess with your heads.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.871
Yes, Lieutenant.
You got it.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.833
I want to know what's
going on, exactly.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.543
Fair enough.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.420
I'm not going to remove
the bone from your chest.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.841
Why?
I also got five milligrams
of midazolam. If you need it.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.176
Would you like
a sedative, Jim?

18:14.510 --> 18:16.052
I want this damn thing
taken out!

18:16.137 --> 18:18.305
Uh, believe it or not,
you're fine for now.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.974
If I remove that from
your chest, that's when you're
gonna be in trouble.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.935
So I'm going to cut down
the bone, so it doesn't move
and damage your lung.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.562
And then we'll wrap
it and secure it, and

18:25.646 --> 18:27.856
you're gonna keep calm until
I can get you to an OR.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.317
No, no, no. This came
from the body of that lunatic!

18:30.401 --> 18:32.110
Do you want to live, Jim?

18:33.154 --> 18:34.196
Yes.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.698
There you go.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.794
Hey, Jim, look at me,
okay? Right in the eyes.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.136
You're doing great, Jim!
You're doing great.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.933
All right.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.645
Hey, you did great.

19:08.397 --> 19:12.734
Okay, here we go.
Lean forward. There you go.
We're almost done.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.529
There it is. Good job.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.241
Keep an eye on him.
Yeah, of course.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.415
Can you toss a sheet
on that for me? Please.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.847
No adhesion between the lung
and chest wall.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.647
Calm down, calm down...

19:52.024 --> 19:54.276
Hey, what's your name
sweetheart?
Ruby.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.612
Oh, that's a beautiful name.
You know, I had
an Aunt Ruby.

19:57.780 --> 20:01.449
She made these pancakes
stuffed with blueberry jam
that I still dream about.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.829
Well, she would make this
special batter,
some family recipe.

20:05.955 --> 20:09.457
Then she'd cook them up
and then make a little cut
in the side

20:09.625 --> 20:11.501
and inject the blueberry jam
with a special straw.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.090
Ah! Gosh, the last one.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.346
I was just outside, sir.
I'm telling you that
is not the case.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.724
There's still people
in the street that need
to be moved,

20:25.808 --> 20:28.059
because we can't confirm or
deny a damn thing
right now.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.354
No, but, uh, there's a
fire in the ceiling that
apparently needs controlling.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.857
Halstead's given the tower
a boot in the ass as
we speak, so we expect

20:33.941 --> 20:35.066
more support shortly.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.610
More cruisers is what
I'm asking for, along
with the bomb squad

20:36.694 --> 20:39.154
and the joint terrorist
task force in case
this guy wasn't working alone.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.198
Yeah, CFD is gonna
contain the victims in the
ER, but Ebola was mentioned.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.534
No one knows yet
exactly what
we're dealing with, Sarge.

20:48.831 --> 20:51.625
No lie, lady, that suit
makes me nervous.

20:52.335 --> 20:56.838
Diane Claman.
Glad you're here,
Diane. Well...

20:57.381 --> 20:59.299
Just show me where he did it.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.572
Excuse me.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.283
What is it?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.118
Electrical fire might
be spreading...

21:27.203 --> 21:30.330
It's up above
the sprinklers. This could
get ugly real fast.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.916
We're out of fire
extinguishers. We got nothing
to fight a fire with.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.211
I know. I know.
Grab that cart.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.450
Electrical system is burning.
This place is gonna
be filled with smoke in

22:07.535 --> 22:08.660
about five minutes.

22:11.038 --> 22:14.332
Chief, situation in
here's just gone
from bad to worse...

22:14.417 --> 22:15.583
What is it, Casey?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.919
Electrical fire in the ceiling
and we're out
of extinguishers...

22:19.380 --> 22:22.799
Okay. We need to get
some CO2
extinguishers inside...

22:23.217 --> 22:27.012
Absolutely not, Wallace.
Anyone who goes in
there will be exposed to

22:27.096 --> 22:29.764
the contagion. That's not
something I can authorize.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.851
I understand that Sharon,
but I've got to give my
men a fighting chance.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.311
I'll do it.
I'm in.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.771
Let's go.
I'll go in.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.897
I'll go.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.943
I can't fight that.

22:44.739 --> 22:48.116
Rice, Cruz. Go.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.474
Come on, people,
let's go to the back of the
room. Come on.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.893
Let's go to the back
of the room.
Room service.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.352
This way.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.396
I want one ladder here
under this vent.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.190
I want one ladder here.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.776
Rice, use that table on
that side.
Got it.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.126
Herrmann!

23:43.047 --> 23:47.342
Casey, how we doing
with that fire?
Beating it down, Chief.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.593
Making some headway I think.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.846
If those poor people inside
weren't panicked before...

23:55.142 --> 23:56.351
Rice!

23:56.477 --> 23:58.561
Step back,
they're doing their jobs.
Firefighters are on it.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.531
Someone! Can someone help us?
Please!

24:10.699 --> 24:13.034
Someone... Please!
Please, please,
you must let us in.

24:13.202 --> 24:16.621
I'm sorry, we've had an
accident here at the hospital
and we've quarantined off

24:16.705 --> 24:17.831
the ER...

24:17.957 --> 24:21.501
Our son... Aleem.
He left a note, apologizing
for not being honest with us,

24:21.794 --> 24:24.170
but that he
was going to the ER
to finish his quest.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.464
His quest.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.425
Oh, God. Is he alive?

24:34.056 --> 24:37.100
Oh, God. Oh, God, no.
No... No, no...

24:37.601 --> 24:39.519
Ma'am?
It's all right, officers.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.105
Come in.
Come in, please.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.026
I, I think the police
may want to speak with you.

24:47.736 --> 24:51.573
What did he do?
This way. Please.

24:58.539 --> 24:59.581
All clear!

25:02.084 --> 25:03.668
I think that's it, Lieutenant!

25:05.171 --> 25:07.338
Fire's out!
All clear!

25:11.260 --> 25:14.804
Fire's out, Chief.
How's that smoke situation?

25:14.889 --> 25:16.097
Hazy but manageable.

25:17.558 --> 25:18.808
Guess we're all in
it now, huh?

25:19.560 --> 25:23.479
How's Severide?
Still unconscious.
We don't know.

25:24.773 --> 25:28.693
Okay, you keep me posted.
Will do, Chief.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.449
Detective.
The parents of the...

25:37.369 --> 25:39.370
All right.
Please, have a seat.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.879
Is there anything
you can tell us?

25:49.131 --> 25:50.882
He was a smart boy.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.635
Always nice, helpful.

25:54.303 --> 25:58.890
This country has given
our family so much... How
could this have happened?

26:00.976 --> 26:03.394
He claimed to be infected
with something
similar to Ebola.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.941
From his work.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.735
What do you mean,
from his work?

26:11.320 --> 26:15.323
He was working at BHO labs.
They study
infectious diseases.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.951
Good lord...
We got to get somebody
down there right now.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.954
I'm on it.
Antonio, where you at?

26:21.038 --> 26:22.121
What else can
you tell me?

26:22.206 --> 26:24.749
Anything about who he might
have been involved with,
planned this with?

26:27.836 --> 26:30.797
You need anything, lady?
A time machine.

26:30.965 --> 26:35.593
You and me both.
When will you know whether
or not we're infected?

26:35.678 --> 26:39.639
I'm running simultaneous
molecular profiles, cellular
evals and blood panels.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.767
Also trying to cross match
the over 250
infectious diseases

26:42.851 --> 26:44.644
this guy might've
been carrying.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.646
Sounds like a needle in
a haystack.

26:55.656 --> 26:59.242
Who's this?
My son. Wayne.

26:59.994 --> 27:04.038
How old is he?
He's supposed to be 28.
But he's going on 14.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.000
Ah, he'll grow out of it.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.171
I want to see my family.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.137
You're gonna see them again.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.643
Hey, any news on Severide?

27:42.578 --> 27:43.953
Oh, come on.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.747
What is it?
Shrapnel between his ribs.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.875
I can't... I can't get
the angle to grip it.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.086
I need rib spreaders.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.921
Go find me a
thoracotomy tray.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.508
Hey, you guys are
doing great.

27:58.969 --> 28:01.429
We're working on getting
some food and water in here.
Okay?

28:12.274 --> 28:14.776
Hey, fireman!
What's the latest?

28:15.194 --> 28:17.779
Everyone's doing all they can.
What the hell's that mean?

28:18.197 --> 28:19.614
No one is telling
us anything!

28:19.740 --> 28:25.203
Hey. You're not helping.
So sit your ass down
and quit being disruptive.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.139
Matt!

28:48.394 --> 28:49.685
I'm walking out of here!

28:49.812 --> 28:51.062
You're gonna have to go
through me.

28:51.814 --> 28:52.897
Aah! Aah!

28:59.655 --> 29:01.989
It's five milligrams
of midazolam. He'll be out
in a minute.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.617
All right.
There you go. That's right.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.828
Close your eyes.
Mmm-hmm. Take a little nap.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.165
Thanks.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.045
I need a thoracotomy tray!

29:20.968 --> 29:22.510
- What do you got?
- Not good.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.512
We need to patch in
your brother.

29:26.682 --> 29:31.477
Mmm-hmm.
He was working with Marburg...
He injected himself with it.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.855
What's Marburg?

29:35.691 --> 29:39.610
It's a viral hemorrhagic
fever. The Soviets developed
it as a biological weapon.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.654
Ask them which strain of
the Marburg virus.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.283
Yeah, which strain?
RAVV.

29:46.410 --> 29:47.994
Okay.
All right.

29:48.412 --> 29:50.288
Okay, so now I just
have to see if he
was past

29:50.372 --> 29:52.206
the incubation period
and actually infectious.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.376
And if he was past
the incubation period?

29:59.214 --> 30:01.924
It means Aleem was
a walking biological weapon.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.406
Here it is.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.325
I need another set
of hands.
Tell me what to do...

30:28.410 --> 30:33.289
Okay. When I say so,
turn this and spread it
open slowly.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.457
Okay.
Okay?

30:38.420 --> 30:39.754
Now!

30:43.592 --> 30:45.259
All right, that's good.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.596
Dammit.
I lost it again.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.724
SATs are dropping, 78%.

30:52.142 --> 30:54.477
Brett, I need you to
take down the balloon on
the ET tube

30:54.561 --> 30:55.728
and push it
into his right main stem.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.314
But then it won't
ventilate his left lung.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.733
Then I'm gonna cut the
interior pulmonary ligament

31:00.817 --> 31:02.985
and move his lung
out of the way.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.615
Ready, now!

31:18.001 --> 31:20.294
One more piece.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.471
Got it.

31:35.644 --> 31:36.936
Arterial bleeder!

31:51.076 --> 31:53.494
The shrapnel hit
the intercostal artery.
Hold this.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.497
All right.
I need a suture.

32:09.219 --> 32:10.511
Heart rate normalizing.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.057
Vitals are stable.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.025
I love being wrong.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.576
Severide's stable,
Chief.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.503
Hey... You...
Christopher.

32:44.880 --> 32:45.921
I need some blood.

32:46.423 --> 32:47.840
Okay. Good?

32:50.927 --> 32:54.805
Aleem left a social media
manifesto to a series
of what I would call

32:54.890 --> 33:00.519
inflammatory websites.
You know, he posted links to
articles on Abu Ghraib,

33:00.604 --> 33:03.147
um, Paris shootings,
Australia...

33:03.231 --> 33:04.899
Definitely wanted the world
to know his footprints...

33:05.484 --> 33:07.485
So, why the hospital?
Why this?

33:07.861 --> 33:11.906
Lone wolves crave spectacle.
To quote one of his tweets,

33:12.324 --> 33:16.661
"I will turn where
Americans go to be cured
into a dying ground."

33:16.745 --> 33:17.828
Jeez.

33:18.955 --> 33:22.249
He knew it'd be newsworthy...
He was right.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.098
What's this for?

33:39.101 --> 33:41.352
Well, in about 30 seconds
we'll know if
you're all gonna die.

34:09.715 --> 34:10.715
What is it?

34:17.264 --> 34:18.556
Not contagious.

34:24.521 --> 34:28.441
Influenza A tested positive,
but the Marburg virus didn't
have time to incubate.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.236
Whatever he had in his body
died with him.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.456
Open up the ER!
On it.

34:44.166 --> 34:47.334
Hey, Chief. All clear.
Not contagious.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.128
We're opening up the ER.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.222
All right. Let's pull that
out and get you home,
partner. What do you say?

35:04.060 --> 35:06.020
There you go.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.564
All right.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.151
Thank you.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.142
Hannah?

36:45.745 --> 36:48.789
When are you going to hear
about your placement?
I don't know.

36:48.874 --> 36:49.999
Soon, I've been told.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.961
Well, I'm gonna miss you
stinking up
the front seat.

36:54.421 --> 36:57.965
Well, that should explain
your liberal use of that
cheap perfume.

37:12.689 --> 37:14.523
All right, detectives.

37:14.608 --> 37:15.941
There's only one
detective here.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.485
I'm a patrolman,
but, you know,
equally as important.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.780
All right. Well, cheers.
Nice to meet you.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.825
We're in the same unit.
Uh-huh.

37:29.706 --> 37:33.167
Just a quick word.
Uh, I want to
take a moment

37:34.002 --> 37:37.212
before I let you all get back
to the fine cocktails that
they serve here at Molly's.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.589
Keep talking, Chief!

37:42.385 --> 37:46.013
To the good people at
Chicago Med.
You made us proud today.

37:47.432 --> 37:52.770
And we are very grateful for
the service that you do for
us and for the city.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.856
It's not said enough.

37:57.651 --> 37:58.651
Thank you, Chief.

37:59.819 --> 38:03.072
We want you all to know
that every time
those doors crash open,

38:03.615 --> 38:07.451
there are good people,
strong people, people at
the top of their game,

38:07.535 --> 38:09.495
ready on the other side.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.873
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear!

38:31.184 --> 38:35.854
This is... This is just
a reaction to the stress
of the day.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.066
Absolutely.

39:19.441 --> 39:20.607
You scared me.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.365
I don't remember any of it.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.452
Nothing?

39:39.961 --> 39:41.211
Nothing.
