01:37.565 --> 01:39.467
CROWN: The FBI in tandem
with Boston Police

01:39.500 --> 01:42.035
and New Hampshire
State Police
recovered six bodies

01:42.069 --> 01:45.273
from a wooded area
in new Hampshire.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.075
The remains are in advanced
stages of decomposition.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.310
The identities
of the victims

01:49.343 --> 01:51.145
will be released
pending DNA results.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.347
REPORTER: Is Emily Byrne
connected to these bodies?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.319
CROWN: No comment.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.654
REPORTER: My source tells me
that Emily Byrne led you
to the mass grave.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.757
Is this part of
a killing spree?

02:03.791 --> 02:07.695
CROWN: Ms. Byrne is
wanted for the murder of
Special Agent Adam Radford.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.733
There is a $250,000 reward

02:12.766 --> 02:15.669
being offered in connection
with that murder.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.371
That concludes
the question and answer...

02:17.405 --> 02:19.006
Detective Gibbs, what about
the shooting last night?

02:19.039 --> 02:22.109
Any truth to reports
that Byrne was involved?
Fatally wounded?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.644
No comment.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.479
What's your working
theory on why she
came back to Boston?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.281
No comment
on Emily Byrne.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.849
No matter
how many times
you ask.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.319
Thank you.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.513
Where are we?

03:34.114 --> 03:35.549
We're in a motel.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.354
I got the bullet out.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.823
Stitched you up.
There's no major
internal damage.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.498
I spoke to Violet.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.235
I know you've been
asking about me.

03:56.837 --> 03:57.838
Why?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.880
I saw some stuff
on your computer.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.317
What stuff?

04:12.820 --> 04:15.889
There are videos
of women being tortured.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.059
My private life is none
of your business.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.595
Water. Drowning.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.664
You know, the whole
world thinks you're
a serial killer.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.934
Folders with
girls' names.
All flowers.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.306
What exactly
are you accusing me of?

04:36.744 --> 04:37.811
Did you do it?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.513
I did what?

04:39.547 --> 04:41.915
You think I had
anything to do
with your kidnapping?

04:42.883 --> 04:43.917
I'm not sure.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.386
You're not sure.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.421
What about the absences
when I was away?

04:47.455 --> 04:49.056
I was in rehab!

04:49.790 --> 04:51.291
Twice!

04:51.325 --> 04:53.394
Trying to dig myself out
of the hole I fell in

04:53.427 --> 04:55.463
after you were taken.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.965
The only way I could deal
with my life turning to shit!

05:00.968 --> 05:02.002
I didn't realize...

05:02.035 --> 05:03.437
Of course you didn't!

05:06.607 --> 05:08.809
And how about some
fucking gratitude, huh?

05:08.842 --> 05:10.310
I could have left you
to die out there,

05:10.344 --> 05:11.412
I could have
turned you in.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.680
And why didn't you?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.026
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.495
You broke into
my apartment,

05:27.528 --> 05:28.762
you snooped around
in my computer,

05:28.796 --> 05:31.465
you followed me,
you had people
ask about me.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.167
I didn't break into
your apartment just
to spy on you,

05:34.201 --> 05:35.503
I swear.
Then why did you?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.705
I just...
I needed your help.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.839
With what?

05:38.872 --> 05:39.940
I had a...

05:39.973 --> 05:42.810
I had something
in my hand at the cemetery.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.479
I was trying to...

05:51.819 --> 05:52.920
Was it this?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.522
Yeah.
A pacemaker?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.023
I found that
on a dead body.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.190
A dead body...

05:57.224 --> 05:58.992
That's what I needed
your help for.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.128
That's the key
to finding
who had me, Jack.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.863
I need your help, please.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.838
You know...

06:10.871 --> 06:13.373
I could go to jail for
what I've already done
for you so far, Em,

06:13.407 --> 06:15.409
so if I'm gonna break
any more laws for you,

06:15.443 --> 06:16.844
you better start
telling me
the whole truth.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.480
I am telling you
the whole truth.
Bullshit!

06:21.549 --> 06:23.717
What about
the others, huh?
Who are they?

06:23.751 --> 06:24.685
What others?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.320
They found six bodies
in those woods, Em.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.089
Six! And you knew
they were there.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.390
How?

06:31.324 --> 06:32.793
What did you
do to them?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.734
KID: Get him! Get him!

06:40.768 --> 06:43.604
What's going on? Stop!

06:43.637 --> 06:45.172
Get off of him!
Flynn, get off!

06:47.274 --> 06:48.375
ALICE: Flynn!

06:48.408 --> 06:50.010
Back off!
He said Mom's a killer.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.512
He said Mom's dead.
You're gonna end up
just like her, freak.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.213
Stay away from me!

06:53.246 --> 06:55.248
The cops are gonna get her
and put a bullet in her head.
Go, get outta here.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.850
Get outta here!

06:56.884 --> 06:57.718
What's going on?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.653
Leave me alone!
ALICE: Flynn!

07:01.589 --> 07:03.991
Hey!
Flynn Durand, downstairs.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.125
Kitchen, now!

07:10.964 --> 07:12.032
ALICE: Sit there.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.044
Let me clean that scrape.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.178
How's Mom?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.116
As soon as the police
hear anything,

07:29.149 --> 07:30.350
they'll tell your father.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.419
In the meantime,
we need to stay calm.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.587
And hope that
she's okay.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.355
I know Mom's alive.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.190
Everyone said
she was dead before.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.358
But they were wrong.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.093
She'll come back
this time, too.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.232
Yeah, well that's...

07:45.265 --> 07:46.466
That's what we're
praying for.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.968
You don't
believe it either.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.803
All the stuff they're
saying about her.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.108
No.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.546
No, I know her.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.715
She's a good person.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.951
And she's a good mother,
she wouldn't do anything

08:03.984 --> 08:07.154
that would hurt her chances
of being with you.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.825
Okay. Come.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.428
I know things are
tough now, okay?

08:15.462 --> 08:17.330
I know they're
confusing, but...

08:17.364 --> 08:18.566
I love you,

08:19.199 --> 08:20.233
we all love you.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.904
We're gonna
figure it out.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.143
Okay?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.581
Go change
your clothes, honey.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.795
Come home.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.833
Please.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.737
For Flynn's sake.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.873
For my sake.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.110
We need to be
together now.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.177
No.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.850
I meant what I said.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.919
End this, Nick.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.623
And then we'll talk
about the future.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.904
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, so let's say
I get all of that,

09:30.938 --> 09:34.341
which I don't, the visions,
the body, all of it,

09:34.374 --> 09:36.677
how does
the pacemaker fit in?

09:36.710 --> 09:39.246
Whoever is tied
to the pacemaker,

09:39.279 --> 09:42.816
is someone who is
connected to my childhood
and to my captor.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.652
But you don't have
any proof of that, Em.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.020
That's why I needed you
to track down the name,

09:47.054 --> 09:48.188
you understand?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.791
It's all connected.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.460
Harlow, the tree,
Barrett House...

09:53.493 --> 09:55.262
None of this is making
any sense, Em.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.329
Then help me make sense.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.831
I'm trying!

09:59.767 --> 10:01.568
Are you okay?
Yeah.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.636
Let me see.
No.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.571
Let me see.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.073
Come on,
move your arm.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.445
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna
need to redress this.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.115
You have to
lay down. Okay?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.516
Yeah.
I got you.

10:16.549 --> 10:17.785
I got you.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.024
All right.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.800
Yeah.

10:37.871 --> 10:38.906
Jack.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.379
Thank you.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.858
Emily,

10:58.792 --> 11:00.360
I sent the cops
to those woods.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.396
I'm sorry.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.166
I didn't mean to,
it was an accident,
it just...

11:17.410 --> 11:18.779
It's okay.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.919
I'll get you
the name.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.158
But first, let me
get you the gauze.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.664
CAMPBELL: So Emily's been
investigating Semerov
all those years.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.067
And now Jack's connected
to one of his girls?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.201
Mmm-hmm.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.635
I don't like it.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.337
Maybe Emily doesn't
like it either.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.774
Because she thinks
he's the one who
had her in the cabin.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.842
The question is, do we?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.480
Two days ago
I would have said yes,

11:53.513 --> 11:57.885
you know, he was a person
of interest. But now,
with going AWOL like this,

11:57.918 --> 11:59.686
knowing that
we have his laptop,

11:59.719 --> 12:02.422
digging around his
dungeon porn collection...

12:03.290 --> 12:04.324
I'm liking her for this.

12:04.357 --> 12:07.660
Then let's step up our game
and find him or Emily.

12:07.694 --> 12:08.929
Either one, Tommy.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.764
You saw the blood
in the alleyway,

12:10.798 --> 12:12.432
she couldn't
have gotten far
with that gunshot.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.934
We're looking everywhere.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.837
The FBI hotline
is definitely not
helping us,

12:16.870 --> 12:19.606
we got like a hundred
bogus tips an hour.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.574
This reward
is killing us.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.976
She's a walking lotto.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.045
But, look, Tommy,
I think we're missing
something here.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.915
She needs medical attention.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.950
Jack Byrne
used to be a doctor.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.018
Yeah.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.988
Yeah!

12:41.995 --> 12:43.130
Em.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.334
I just got this.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.037
What should I do?

12:51.738 --> 12:53.306
Call him.
How?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.607
Use the burner.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.009
Keep it under two minutes.

12:56.043 --> 12:59.913
And then we have to
power it off right after.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.050
See if you can find
anything out about
the bodies, too.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.321
Okay, it's ringing.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.529
NICK ON PHONE: Agent Durand.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.931
Nick, hey, it's Jack.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.568
Did you find her?
Uh, yeah...

13:21.601 --> 13:23.636
No. No, we didn't get her.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.974
Thanks for
calling back so fast.
What number is this?

13:27.007 --> 13:28.041
I got a new phone.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.911
The damn reporters
kept calling me.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.013
So what's going on?
I saw the news.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.582
All those bodies
in the woods,
I mean... Jesus.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.085
Yeah. Look...
she was shot.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.819
She might need
medical attention.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.821
She might
reach out to you.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.490
If she does,
I'll call you.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.657
Yeah, thanks.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.093
Are you at home now?

13:46.593 --> 13:47.660
Yeah. Why?

13:47.694 --> 13:49.162
Can I
swing by in a bit?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.965
Talk about some things
that could help
with the case.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.800
I'm heading
in that direction
anyway.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.103
Alice took Flynn
to Morris for a few days.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.171
Yeah, sure.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.008
But if I'm not there,
then I'm running
some errands.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.978
Thanks, Jack,
wow, this is...
It's a mess...

14:05.012 --> 14:06.613
Nick, I gotta go.
I'm sorry.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.015
Okay, bye.
Well, listen, I...

14:10.783 --> 14:12.085
Was that okay?

14:13.653 --> 14:14.888
Great.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.429
JOHN: Sorry, he was
using a burner and the call
was too short.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.965
We caught him in a lie.
He said he was home.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.167
We've got uniforms
there now, it's empty.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.868
JOHN: I'm sending you
a file from our techs.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.237
You'll want to
read it ASAP.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.505
TOMMY: Yeah.
Okay, thanks.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.075
You two are
brothers-in-law,

14:35.108 --> 14:36.576
you never got
a vibe off Jack?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.978
Never.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.546
He was a doctor,
Ivy League.

14:39.579 --> 14:43.050
It's not like
we went to barbecues
and ballgames together.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.384
He and Emily
were never close.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.154
Just when Jack Byrne
was starting to look
like our guy.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.560
Our techs just went
through the hard drives
at Semerov's club.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.095
Jack was listed
as a customer.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.463
And his payments
sync up perfectly

14:56.496 --> 14:59.099
with those withdrawals
from his secret account.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.302
He never used the money
to fund the cabin setup.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.871
Well, we don't know
if she knows that.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.574
She's with him,
I'm telling you,
I could tell by his voice.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.110
She could have
snatched him up
thinking he was the one.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.578
We've gotta find them.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.423
Hey.
Hey.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.924
Come and check this out.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.027
I found a name.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.361
Okay.
You were right.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.629
There is a connection.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.936
EMILY:
Dr. Lu-Fang Shen, MIT.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.339
Behavioral scientist.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.740
The name means
nothing to me.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.042
Look at the next tab.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.610
Here.

15:45.878 --> 15:48.915
Oh my God.
Barrett House.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.517
Yeah, your orphanage.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.287
Dr. Shen was
an administrator there.
He started there after you left.

15:54.321 --> 15:57.924
Went missing
16 years ago,
was declared dead after 10.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.293
Okay, we gotta find
someone we can talk to.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.665
There. He's got
a brother.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.335
Erik Shen.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.473
Owns a restaurant
in Chinatown. And...

16:14.007 --> 16:15.042
It's still open.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.809
What did the hotel
do with my stuff?

16:16.843 --> 16:19.446
They didn't have room,
they're still in
the trunk of my car.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.415
Can you get
me the duffel bag?

16:22.449 --> 16:23.650
Yeah. Of course.

17:59.879 --> 18:06.153
(LIGHT ORIENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING)

18:06.653 --> 18:07.720
EMILY: Excuse me...

18:08.888 --> 18:10.089
Hi, is Mr. Shen here?

18:10.123 --> 18:12.225
Just a moment.
Thank you.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.559
Erik Shen?

18:50.463 --> 18:51.531
I'm...

18:52.999 --> 18:55.168
Special Agent Parker, FBI.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.770
I was hoping to discuss
your brother's disappearance.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.140
That was many years ago.

19:01.174 --> 19:03.743
I have no interest
in discussing it.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.178
We have a new lead.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.614
Look, I'm sorry.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.317
This is behind me,
I don't need to
know anything.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.885
Somebody came forward.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.609
ERIK: I don't remember
much about Lu-Fang's work.

19:36.643 --> 19:40.347
Only that it was
controversial.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.915
He said that was why
MIT dismissed him.

19:42.949 --> 19:46.185
Yeah, but the orphanage job
seems like an odd choice.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.221
I never understood
that move.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.459
But the work
gave him purpose.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.827
It gave him joy working
with those children.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.668
Did he ever talk
to you about his work?

20:01.701 --> 20:02.769
No.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.837
But he was always
with those children.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.974
Either there, or he would
sign them out on weekends,

20:08.007 --> 20:11.678
take them to museums,
zoo, planetarium.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.614
Was he married?

20:15.748 --> 20:18.485
Any kind of
romantic relationships?

20:20.186 --> 20:22.289
He was married
for a short time.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.492
His wife died.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.861
I never really
got to know her.

20:30.597 --> 20:36.536
Lu-Fang was always
a bit strange.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.613
Did you keep
any of his things?

20:49.115 --> 20:51.083
In his will he left
all his research

20:51.117 --> 20:52.919
to the Boston Athenaeum.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.259
But my wife never
got around to it...

21:03.496 --> 21:05.932
It's in storage.
I can give you the key.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.370
Thank you.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.574
JACK: My name is Jack
and I'm an alcoholic.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.709
ALL: Hello, Jack.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.846
I'm here because my...

21:20.613 --> 21:23.282
Friend had
a medical emergency

21:23.816 --> 21:26.686
and I needed to step up.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.291
It's been four years
since I last operated.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.396
But it was someone
I care about on my table.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.398
When I picked up
the scalpel,

21:41.067 --> 21:42.602
all I could think was...

21:45.472 --> 21:47.073
I can't do this.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.343
I can't do this.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.744
I can't do this.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.788
Oh!

22:04.857 --> 22:06.192
I thought...

22:06.225 --> 22:08.628
I need a shot, you know?

22:08.661 --> 22:11.030
A shot will calm
my nerves and if...

22:11.063 --> 22:13.400
And if one is good,
then two is better, right?

22:13.433 --> 22:14.734
I'll be steady as a rock.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.310
But then I remembered

22:24.343 --> 22:26.813
why I lost my license
in the first place.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.619
I stepped up.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.321
I didn't take the drink.

22:38.725 --> 22:39.792
Okay.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.831
And I saved someone
I care about.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.652
Oh!

23:23.470 --> 23:25.705
I felt like I'd been
given a second chance.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.154
This is the first day
of my sobriety.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.136
Jack Byrne.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.172
What's this about?

24:01.073 --> 24:02.909
I need you to come with me.

27:03.522 --> 27:06.659
SHEN ON TAPE: You've been
given placebos but informed
of the side effects...

27:11.998 --> 27:14.633
For the final phase,
we'll use two subjects,

27:14.667 --> 27:16.035
A and B.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.265
SHEN ON TAPE:
Get inside the tank.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.168
CHILD ON TAPE:
No. I don't want to.

27:49.201 --> 27:53.105
SHEN ON TAPE: But one of you
must do the experiment today.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.406
Who will it be?

27:54.440 --> 27:55.875
CHILD ON TAPE: Nobody.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.244
SHEN ON TAPE:
Someone must.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.047
You may choose.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.949
CHILD ON TAPE: Why?
What did we do wrong?

28:02.982 --> 28:06.552
SHEN ON TAPE: Nothing.
This is special work.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.989
You are part of
something very special.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.824
CHILD ON TAPE:
I want to leave.

28:11.858 --> 28:15.061
SHEN ON TAPE: Okay,
then I will choose.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.965
CHILD ON TAPE:
No! Please.
Don't make me.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.200
No! Stop!
Don't hurt me! Please!

28:21.233 --> 28:25.571
Don't hurt me!
Don't hurt me!

28:32.344 --> 28:34.747
We know you came
to your sister's aid.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.316
Her blood was
in your car.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.151
Nice try.

28:40.853 --> 28:44.090
There's no proof
when she was in
my client's car.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.492
Here's what I'm trying
to understand, Jack.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.029
You helped us
track her down.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.298
Now you're willing to
go to jail for her?

28:54.566 --> 28:56.402
What changed

28:58.971 --> 29:01.607
Look, I get it.
I get it.

29:01.640 --> 29:05.177
She got shot,
this was life and death,

29:05.211 --> 29:07.546
the kind of thing you put
differences aside for.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.015
That's why you helped her.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.152
Work with me here
a little bit, huh?

29:14.887 --> 29:17.123
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.687
MAN 1: Bitch almost
got away from us.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.289
Thought we lost her.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.625
MAN 2: Holy fuck!

29:53.659 --> 29:55.027
MAN 1: You know
what we gotta do.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.463
MAN 2: Yeah, not
looking forward to it.

29:57.496 --> 30:01.100
MAN 1: We gotta find a cop,
turn her in, just get
that reward money.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.935
MAN 2: We split that shit
down the middle.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.272
MAN 1: Fuck middle my ass.
I found her.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.907
MAN 2: You couldn't
have done it without me.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.409
Bitch killed six people,
maybe more.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.881
MAN 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Anyway, I provided the ride,
you don't even have a car.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.415
MAN 1: You know what?
Fuck you and your car.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.784
MAN 2: Hey, fuck you, too!
MAN 1: What'd you say?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.186
MAN 2: Nothing.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.689
MAN 1: Just keep going.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.392
MAN 1: Hey,
did you hear that?

30:27.426 --> 30:28.560
MAN 2: Hear what?

30:28.594 --> 30:29.862
MAN 1: Stop the car.

30:49.781 --> 30:50.983
MAN 2: I didn't
hear anything.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.385
MAN 1: Shh!
Shut the fuck up!

31:01.093 --> 31:04.763
MAN 1: Come on, man,
let's get the money
before she wakes up.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.298
Come on, let's go, let's go!

31:06.332 --> 31:08.134
MAN 2: All right,
I'm going, I'm going.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.966
MAN 1: Man, it's
the red light. Stop!

31:41.333 --> 31:43.402
MAN 1: Watch the road,
you're gonna get us killed.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.271
I don't want to die
before I get rich.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.438
MAN 1: Come on,
let me drive.

31:46.472 --> 31:49.575
MAN 2: No fucking way!
It's my ride.

31:49.608 --> 31:52.744
Oh, my God! Are you all right?
MAN 1: I don't
give a fuck. Either...

31:52.778 --> 31:55.547
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

31:55.581 --> 31:57.316
Hey, my car!

31:59.851 --> 32:01.120
She stole my car!

32:02.254 --> 32:03.355
Hey, my car!

32:03.622 --> 32:04.690
Shit!

32:06.125 --> 32:08.060
You tied her, man!

32:37.289 --> 32:40.092
If he gives us something,
he can walk out of here.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.402
How did she contact you?

32:53.072 --> 32:54.640
Where did you
pick her up?

32:54.940 --> 32:56.242
Hmm?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.612
Did she say anything
about those woods?

33:01.413 --> 33:03.649
Those bodies,
those graves?

33:05.584 --> 33:06.685
Come on.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.021
Huh?

33:09.055 --> 33:11.457
We found six bodies
over there, Jack.

33:12.724 --> 33:14.193
She didn't do it.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.430
It was you?

33:19.898 --> 33:21.233
What?

33:22.468 --> 33:23.502
Let's see.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.441
Getting fired
from the hospital,

33:29.475 --> 33:32.044
secret bank account,
connections to Semerov...

33:32.078 --> 33:34.113
You think I don't know
what you're doing here?

33:35.581 --> 33:38.117
You think I can't
see through this?

33:38.150 --> 33:39.418
You try to pump me
for information

33:39.451 --> 33:42.988
and then you're just gonna
twist it and turn it

33:43.021 --> 33:45.291
and use it however
you want against her.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.458
So, no.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.595
I have nothing for you.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.340
I got these for you.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.447
Jack Byrne,

34:10.015 --> 34:13.285
you're under arrest
for harboring
a wanted fugitive.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.299
How is your boy?

35:01.333 --> 35:02.801
He's confused about Emily.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.536
I don't know
what to tell him.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.608
They're resilient.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.379
Maybe all the signs
were there

35:13.412 --> 35:15.614
and I just missed them,
you know?

35:16.715 --> 35:18.617
What signs?

35:18.650 --> 35:20.319
The way she would get...

35:23.422 --> 35:26.725
When she wanted something
and she didn't get it.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.562
She'd snap.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.898
Now you're describing
my ex-wife.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.468
Wife number one, two or three?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.337
Touche.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.367
SHEN ON TAPE:
How did it make you feel?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.668
CHILD ON TAPE:
I couldn't breathe.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.471
I was swallowing water.
I thought I was going to die.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.340
Why are you
doing this to us?

36:48.374 --> 36:51.310
SHEN ON TAPE: To see
how you adapt to your
surroundings over time.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.778
CHILD ON TAPE:
I hate it.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.081
SHEN ON TAPE:
The only way to stop it

36:56.114 --> 36:58.517
is to do the experiment
on someone else.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.220
That means you will be
in charge of adding
the water to the tank.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.559
CHILD ON TAPE:
No. No, please.
Please don't!

37:07.593 --> 37:10.829
Please don't do this to me!
I don't want to
do this, please!

37:10.862 --> 37:16.101
I don't wanna do this!
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

37:20.138 --> 37:21.907
SHEN ON TAPE:
Easy! Easy, Charles!

37:21.940 --> 37:24.643
CHARLES ON TAPE:
I hate you!

37:28.514 --> 37:32.684
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

37:36.688 --> 37:39.291
SHEN ON TAPE:
Easy! Easy, Charles!

37:44.262 --> 37:45.864
Cut it out, Charles!

38:11.690 --> 38:14.660
ALICE ON VOICEMAIL:
Hi, this is Alice.
Leave a message.

38:16.328 --> 38:19.197
Hey, it's me, um...

38:19.230 --> 38:21.232
Give me a call back
when you get this.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.568
I just want to
give you a heads up,

38:22.601 --> 38:25.804
I'm on my way over.
I won't stay long.

38:27.606 --> 38:28.740
Bye.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.086
Alice!

39:59.297 --> 40:00.966
Hey, baby, it's me.

40:02.300 --> 40:05.571
I just wanted to call
to tell you that

40:07.105 --> 40:09.074
I'm still alive

40:11.342 --> 40:12.844
and I love you.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.750
And we'll be together
soon, okay?
