They're still breathing.

How in the name of purple
wombats do they manage that?

02:58.947 --> 03:01.747
Check the air indicator.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.349
Not enough for a mouse.

03:05.351 --> 03:10.654
Mouse? It's too much.
Let it drop below Butterfly.

03:14.893 --> 03:20.663
Pull it out much faster.
Suck the air out faster.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.933
Ah! That's better.

03:25.935 --> 03:27.501
Now, my little polly

03:27.503 --> 03:32.105
let me know the instant
it drops below Butterfly.

03:34.508 --> 03:37.009
Well, hello,
my leather-lunged adversary.

03:37.011 --> 03:40.612
Let me see you try
to breathe now.

03:41.981 --> 03:44.482
Butterfly!

03:44.484 --> 03:47.585
Butterfly, Batman.
Butterfly.

03:47.587 --> 03:50.988
'Watch the bouncing balloons.'

03:50.990 --> 03:55.559
'Going, going..'

03:56.861 --> 03:58.628
'...gone!'

03:58.830 --> 04:00.095
They're done for!

04:00.097 --> 04:02.664
They're, both of them, done for!

04:04.100 --> 04:07.201
Hip hip hurray! Hip hip hurray!

04:07.203 --> 04:10.938
Oh, fondest dreams..
Oh, secret hopes..

04:10.940 --> 04:14.741
At last, I have defeated
the dynamic duo.

04:14.743 --> 04:18.010
What are we standing here for?
Off we go. Off we go.

04:18.012 --> 04:21.346
But, boss, don't we gotta
get rid of the bodies?

04:21.348 --> 04:22.046
Yeah.

04:22.048 --> 04:23.380
First things first.

04:23.382 --> 04:25.048
First we establish an alibi

04:25.050 --> 04:27.417
and then we destroy
the evidence.

04:27.419 --> 04:28.418
Move move move already.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.454
I must find me
a fine-fitting alibi.

04:30.456 --> 04:33.123
Quick, hurry!

04:59.382 --> 05:00.715
Robin.

05:02.350 --> 05:04.317
Wake up, Robin.

05:05.452 --> 05:07.286
'And once I freed Robin'

05:07.288 --> 05:08.220
'I carried him out'

05:08.222 --> 05:09.387
'of Penguin's vacuum tank'

05:09.389 --> 05:10.588
'to the Batmobile'

05:10.590 --> 05:11.789
'and here we are.'

05:11.791 --> 05:14.291
Well, I can understand
how you got away

05:14.293 --> 05:15.659
but one thing puzzles me.

05:15.661 --> 05:17.527
You say it was a vacuum tank.

05:17.529 --> 05:19.161
If so, what did you breathe?

05:19.163 --> 05:20.462
He breathed air, chief.

05:20.464 --> 05:21.796
But there wasn't no air.

05:21.798 --> 05:22.797
But there was.

05:22.799 --> 05:24.765
The emergency tank of bat-oxygen

05:24.767 --> 05:26.433
right here in my utility belt.

05:26.435 --> 05:30.570
After cutting my bonds
with my bat-knife..

05:30.572 --> 05:31.871
The rest was simple.

05:32.173 --> 05:34.173
Thank the saints
for the utility belt.

05:34.175 --> 05:38.544
Holy oxygen! It's a good thing
one of us thought of that.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.478
Incredible.

05:39.480 --> 05:40.679
- Isn't it, chief?
- Yes, sir.

05:40.681 --> 05:42.147
Only you could be
so resourceful.

05:42.149 --> 05:46.084
Only you could put that
pusillanimous Penguin to flight.

05:46.086 --> 05:48.052
The salt fishing pier,
you say?

05:48.054 --> 05:50.220
I'll have the dragnet
out in ten minutes.

05:50.222 --> 05:52.255
I'll put Penguin
back up the river

05:52.257 --> 05:53.823
before he can bat an eye.

05:53.825 --> 05:54.790
It's no use, Chief O'Hara.

05:54.792 --> 05:57.259
Not even a dragnet
could trap him now.

05:57.261 --> 05:58.359
He got away?

05:58.161 --> 06:00.928
We scoured the entire pier.

06:00.930 --> 06:03.497
By the time
Robin and I were free

06:03.499 --> 06:04.698
the Penguin had fled.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.167
But don't fret about it,
Chief O'Hara

06:07.169 --> 06:08.768
we'll have another chance.

06:08.770 --> 06:10.503
Another chance?
I don't see how.

06:10.505 --> 06:13.772
You're forgetting the Penguin's
plot, commissioner.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.040
The millionaire's award dinner.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.976
Jumpin' codfish,
it's all we have.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.711
Now, he won't
give that up, will he?

06:20.713 --> 06:23.980
Not when there's 12 million
in cash involved.

06:23.982 --> 06:25.848
What shall we do, Batman?

06:25.850 --> 06:26.949
Stop him of course,
commissioner.

06:26.951 --> 06:30.719
But how? We don't even know
where the dinner is.

06:30.721 --> 06:31.720
No, we don't.

06:31.722 --> 06:32.787
But there's one man who does.

06:32.789 --> 06:36.090
The man who arranged the entire
dinner in the first place.

06:36.092 --> 06:37.724
Multimillionaire Bruce Wayne.

06:37.726 --> 06:39.625
Good thinking, Batman.

06:39.627 --> 06:42.661
Of course!
Bruce Wayne.

06:42.862 --> 06:44.996
Contact him immediately.

06:44.998 --> 06:47.531
You should be able
to reach him in his mansion.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.935
Then call me.
I shall arrange a counterplot.

06:50.937 --> 06:52.202
Right.

07:18.929 --> 07:20.462
Bruce!

07:23.198 --> 07:24.998
Mr. Gordon, how are you?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.399
In need of help, Bruce.

07:26.401 --> 07:29.135
Your ward, Dick Grayson,
told me I could find you here.

07:29.137 --> 07:32.171
I'm flattered. How can I help
Gotham City Police Department?

07:32.173 --> 07:36.175
Well, information is what
we need most at the moment.

07:36.177 --> 07:37.409
Uh..

07:38.244 --> 07:41.613
We must know where
the millionaire's award dinner

07:41.615 --> 07:43.081
will take place.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.650
Why is that information
so important, commissioner?

07:45.652 --> 07:48.986
We're expecting
the Penguin to strike again.

07:48.988 --> 07:51.588
The dinner will be held
in the captain's dining saloon

07:51.590 --> 07:54.958
aboard the flagship
of the Wayne Steamship Company.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.093
The S.S. Gotham Neptune.

07:57.095 --> 07:58.027
Thank you, Bruce.

07:58.029 --> 07:58.894
Now, you must excuse me

07:58.896 --> 08:01.329
I have a multitude
of details to work out.

08:01.331 --> 08:03.064
Yes, of course, commissioner.

08:08.336 --> 08:11.137
He's right here, sir.

08:12.272 --> 08:13.972
Yes, commissioner?

08:13.974 --> 08:17.675
You spoke to Bruce Wayne. And?

08:17.842 --> 08:21.044
Good. Call him back
and tell him..

08:21.878 --> 08:24.579
Of course, commissioner,
I'll assist in any way I can

08:24.581 --> 08:26.981
to help you and Batman
trap Penguin.

08:26.983 --> 08:31.852
You want our little group
of multimillionaires to do what?

08:33.821 --> 08:35.520
The rest is quite simple really.

08:35.523 --> 08:38.924
Word has been leaked
via the underworld grapevine

08:38.926 --> 08:44.129
that the millionaire award
dinner will be held..

08:44.131 --> 08:45.497
...here.

08:45.499 --> 08:47.966
'Wayne Manor.'

08:49.601 --> 08:51.835
But it will not be held there.

08:51.837 --> 08:55.572
Instead, it will
actually be held..

08:55.574 --> 08:56.940
...here.

08:56.942 --> 08:58.007
'In the captain's dining saloon'

08:58.009 --> 09:01.377
aboard the flagship
of the Wayne Steamship Line.

09:01.379 --> 09:03.579
The Gotham Neptune.

09:05.681 --> 09:06.547
Holy rudder!

09:06.949 --> 09:10.484
You mean that while that
dinner's being held onboard..

09:10.486 --> 09:11.051
...meanwhile--

09:11.453 --> 09:14.320
Meanwhile, the Penguin
and his criminal cohorts

09:14.322 --> 09:16.055
will close in on the mansion.

09:16.057 --> 09:18.057
Right into the arms
of the waiting place.

09:18.059 --> 09:20.492
Golly, Alfred,
it's a perfect plan, isn't it?

09:20.494 --> 09:22.260
Perfection indeed, Master Robin.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.929
The police to pounce
on the Penguin

09:24.931 --> 09:26.964
'Batman and you at the banquet'

09:26.966 --> 09:29.299
to safeguard the millions.

09:29.301 --> 09:30.300
And speaking of perfection, sir

09:30.302 --> 09:33.369
if you'd excuse me,
I have much to prepare.

09:33.371 --> 09:35.237
The menu for the banquet.

09:35.239 --> 09:38.240
Everything from caviar
to crepes suzette.

09:38.242 --> 09:39.307
Not to mention the giant cake

09:39.309 --> 09:42.043
out of which will pop
the young lady chosen

09:42.045 --> 09:44.445
to represent
the charity this year.

09:44.447 --> 09:46.547
Yes, indeed, sir.

09:50.619 --> 09:52.853
Oh, and, sir..

09:52.920 --> 09:53.586
Yes, Alfred?

09:54.088 --> 09:57.022
Which young lady
has been chosen?

09:57.189 --> 10:00.224
The honor falls to
Ms. Natural Resources.

10:00.226 --> 10:03.694
She is our chosen
charity for the year.

10:04.095 --> 10:06.062
Very good, sir.

10:06.296 --> 10:08.497
Holy jitterbugs!
That twitch again.

10:08.499 --> 10:10.231
Poor fellow.

10:10.233 --> 10:13.067
But he was kidnapped.

10:13.069 --> 10:17.204
Batman, I have
a horrible thought.

10:17.206 --> 10:19.639
Can we trust Alfred?

10:19.641 --> 10:22.274
Implicitly, Robin.

10:22.276 --> 10:26.111
I trust Alfred implicitly.

10:46.164 --> 10:47.897
Mr. Wayne's residence.

10:47.899 --> 10:48.998
Alfred speaking.

10:51.935 --> 10:53.768
Who is that speaking?

10:55.171 --> 10:57.004
Who else but Penguin?

10:57.006 --> 10:58.739
Remember, Alfred?

11:00.109 --> 11:00.974
I remember.

11:00.976 --> 11:05.712
The time and place
of the millionaire's dinner.

11:06.981 --> 11:08.280
Report.

11:08.781 --> 11:12.817
Word has been leaked
via the underworld grapevine

11:12.819 --> 11:17.421
that the millionaire's award
dinner will be held here.

11:17.423 --> 11:20.090
Here? Where?

11:20.825 --> 11:22.225
Wayne Manor.

11:22.227 --> 11:23.259
But..

11:23.761 --> 11:25.160
But what?

11:26.695 --> 11:29.963
Answer, you soporific servitor!

11:33.033 --> 11:36.135
But it will not be held here.

11:36.137 --> 11:40.806
- Actually, it will be held..
- 'Yes?'

11:40.808 --> 11:44.309
...in the captain's
dining saloon..

11:44.311 --> 11:44.976
And?

11:44.978 --> 11:49.080
Onboard the flagship
of the Wayne Steamship Line.

11:49.082 --> 11:53.117
- 'Yes?'
- The Gotham Neptune.

11:53.251 --> 11:55.752
The Gotham Neptune.

11:55.754 --> 11:57.920
And the winning charity?

12:01.323 --> 12:04.391
Ms. Natural Resources.

12:04.393 --> 12:05.925
Good.

12:05.927 --> 12:08.127
You have remembered.

12:08.129 --> 12:11.730
Now, you will forget.

12:19.304 --> 12:21.238
Hello? Hello?

12:21.240 --> 12:24.007
Hmph. No one there.

12:40.256 --> 12:41.189
That's fine.

12:41.591 --> 12:43.824
Now, come on.
Batman is on his way up.

12:43.826 --> 12:45.192
- We gotta be ready.
- Batman?

12:45.194 --> 12:47.594
I thought Bruce Wayne
was gonna escort me.

12:47.596 --> 12:50.296
He's out of town,
Batman is filling in.

13:04.809 --> 13:06.376
Stand still, will you?

13:06.378 --> 13:09.245
All you gotta do is
jump out of that cake

13:09.247 --> 13:11.313
and let him throw money at you.

13:11.315 --> 13:14.149
Hey, what's this?
What are you doing?

13:27.226 --> 13:30.228
Quick, quick,
my little goldfish.

13:30.230 --> 13:32.931
Quick, quick,
you fumbling finks.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.766
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

13:34.768 --> 13:36.000
Out!

13:55.352 --> 13:58.253
Courage, my little haddock.

14:00.155 --> 14:01.255
Psst. Psst.

14:11.765 --> 14:13.665
Ms. Natural Resources?

14:13.667 --> 14:16.934
Yes. And you're my escort.

14:16.936 --> 14:18.735
I'm so thrilled.

14:18.737 --> 14:23.539
- I trust you like orchids.
- I love them.

14:23.541 --> 14:24.907
They're my favorite.

14:24.909 --> 14:28.710
Do you mind if I put
them on in the elevator?

14:28.712 --> 14:31.846
Well, it's so drafty
standing here.

14:31.848 --> 14:32.947
No, of course not.

14:32.949 --> 14:35.950
How rude of me
not to have noticed.

14:41.256 --> 14:45.692
Oh, by the way, have you ever
popped out of a cake before?

14:45.694 --> 14:47.927
No. But I've been practicing.

14:47.929 --> 14:52.332
Good. Then there should be
no trouble at all.

14:52.334 --> 14:54.300
No trouble.

15:05.411 --> 15:06.310
<i> Two hours later..</i>

15:06.312 --> 15:10.447
<i> ...aboard the gaudy</i>
<i> Gotham Neptune..</i>

15:10.948 --> 15:13.416
- Nice dinner, Alfred.
- Thank you, sir.

15:13.418 --> 15:15.985
Mint? Or would you prefer
a chocolate almond?

15:15.987 --> 15:16.852
No, thank you.

15:16.854 --> 15:18.253
Say, Batman,
isn't it about time?

15:18.255 --> 15:20.622
I'm very anxious
to donate my million dollars.

15:20.624 --> 15:24.459
Shall I bring in
the <i> piece de resistance,</i> sir?

15:24.461 --> 15:25.560
<i> Piece de resistance?</i>

15:25.562 --> 15:29.630
French, sir. It refers
to the feature of the evening.

15:29.632 --> 15:31.532
Oh, yes. Of course!

15:31.534 --> 15:33.066
The giant cake.

15:33.068 --> 15:34.133
Yes. Yes, Alfred.

15:34.135 --> 15:35.000
As Mr. Wayne's stand-in

15:35.002 --> 15:37.335
it's my job
to keep things moving.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.837
You may fetch it now.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.772
At once, sir.

16:24.278 --> 16:27.646
You may come out now,
young lady.

17:02.211 --> 17:03.477
<i> Millionaire's row.</i>

17:03.479 --> 17:09.115
<i> Down they go</i>
<i> like diamond-studded ten-pin.</i>

17:10.817 --> 17:12.384
Batman! Master Robin!

17:12.386 --> 17:15.153
Oh, what have I done?

17:17.756 --> 17:18.454
My..

17:18.957 --> 17:20.690
Get the loot,
then back to the pier.

17:20.692 --> 17:24.627
The pier? But, boss, the fuzz
know all about the pier.

17:24.628 --> 17:27.930
Wise up, you finny fools.

17:27.932 --> 17:28.864
They found it empty.

17:28.866 --> 17:32.601
That's the last place
they'd expect me to go.

17:33.870 --> 17:36.904
<i> Victory for the fishy foul.</i>

17:36.906 --> 17:38.705
<i> Can this be?</i>

17:38.707 --> 17:40.406
<i> Unmoving, silent..</i>

17:40.408 --> 17:43.976
<i> ...the Caped Crusader</i>
<i> and the Boy Wonder.</i>

17:43.978 --> 17:45.544
<i> Oh, gloom!</i>

17:45.646 --> 17:47.846
<i> Oh, doom!</i>

18:04.030 --> 18:05.096
Boss, you got it!

18:06.532 --> 18:09.366
Let's see it, boss.
The money. The millions.

18:09.368 --> 18:11.368
Feast your eye there.

18:11.370 --> 18:13.536
Makes me mouth water.

18:13.538 --> 18:14.537
How about our cut?

18:16.574 --> 18:19.875
You wanna swallow the whole
thing in a gulp, do you?

18:19.877 --> 18:22.277
Here, my fine finny finks.

18:22.279 --> 18:26.681
Here's a few hundred fish
for the hors d'oeuvres.

18:27.817 --> 18:30.818
Hey, boss, you know
what I'll do with my cut?

18:30.820 --> 18:32.319
I'm going to the South Seas

18:32.321 --> 18:34.954
and open up a school
for pirates.

18:35.789 --> 18:36.955
Do what you like

18:36.957 --> 18:38.723
but with my giant share

18:38.725 --> 18:41.325
I'm going to put it in the safe.

18:41.327 --> 18:43.393
Not for me the simple life

18:43.395 --> 18:45.428
blowing under the
breadfruit tree.

18:45.430 --> 18:49.999
No, my share will be used
for nobler purposes.

18:50.001 --> 18:52.601
To escalate the cause of crime.

18:52.903 --> 18:55.737
- What crime, boss?
- Well, the bigger, the better.

18:55.739 --> 18:58.940
Now that I'm rich,
I can bribe, I can borrow

18:58.942 --> 19:00.942
I can scheme, I can connive.

19:00.944 --> 19:02.877
What's the matter, Finella?
You look forlorn.

19:02.879 --> 19:06.080
Maybe she's cold, boss.
She forgot her fur coat.

19:06.082 --> 19:07.714
That's the problem, huh?

19:07.716 --> 19:10.717
Here, buy another.
Buy a dozen of them.

19:11.586 --> 19:13.319
Now you stop that.
Stop it.

19:13.321 --> 19:15.688
I can't stand the gurgling
of tears.

19:15.690 --> 19:18.557
No, I can't take it.
It's not mine.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.626
Not the coat,
not the money.

19:20.628 --> 19:21.827
Not anything.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.996
Just because I wanted to
win a beauty contest.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.899
Ah, my little gold pigeon,
little tadpole, you did win it.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.835
When you popped out
of that giant popover

19:31.837 --> 19:32.803
and we won this!

19:32.805 --> 19:34.504
No. I cheated.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.438
And you cheated.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.608
And that's for charity,
not for cheats.

19:40.111 --> 19:44.813
Who's gonna save
our natural resources now?

19:44.815 --> 19:47.448
'Good girl'

19:50.651 --> 19:52.451
The dynamic duo!

19:52.453 --> 19:54.653
You have learned your lesson.

19:54.655 --> 19:55.954
Crime never pays.

19:55.956 --> 19:58.089
- Batman!
- But it can't be.

19:58.091 --> 20:00.157
We gassed you at the party.

20:00.159 --> 20:02.425
We prepared ourselves beforehand

20:02.427 --> 20:04.493
with anti-Penguin gas pills.

20:04.495 --> 20:08.397
Beat me back here to boot,
but you'll never get me alive.

20:08.399 --> 20:09.698
No!

20:33.489 --> 20:35.022
Robin!

21:22.533 --> 21:25.468
Hoist in your own evil net.

21:25.470 --> 21:27.736
You'll pay for this.

21:27.938 --> 21:31.472
Not before you do, Penguin.
Behind bars.

21:31.474 --> 21:32.673
Robin, call the police.

21:32.675 --> 21:34.941
Tell them the culprit is theirs.

21:52.190 --> 21:54.024
Alfred!

22:05.369 --> 22:08.304
Oh, may I have some
of that please?

22:08.306 --> 22:09.605
Oh.

22:10.640 --> 22:11.640
Thank you.

22:11.642 --> 22:13.408
Isn't this a lovely party?

22:13.410 --> 22:14.509
Yes, isn't it?

22:14.611 --> 22:18.613
Oh, I do hope all that money
will be safe this time.

22:18.615 --> 22:20.047
You may rest assured, madam.

22:20.049 --> 22:22.049
Now that the Penguin
is in the pen

22:22.051 --> 22:24.184
Mr. Wayne says
that the award dinner

22:24.186 --> 22:26.853
will proceed
in complete safety.

22:26.855 --> 22:27.453
Oh.

22:27.955 --> 22:31.456
No, I don't know any more than
what was in the newspapers.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.558
Just that Batman and Robin
came to the rescue.

22:33.560 --> 22:37.595
And in the nick of time,
if I may say so, Master Dick.

22:37.597 --> 22:39.063
Excuse me, will you?

22:39.065 --> 22:41.299
I shudder when I think
of what might have been.

22:41.301 --> 22:42.700
That was not your fault, Alfred.

22:42.702 --> 22:47.171
Oh, but it was. Allowing myself
to be brainwashed by Penguin.

22:47.573 --> 22:50.907
I gave away the whole plot.

22:50.909 --> 22:52.508
On the contrary, Alfred

22:52.510 --> 22:53.508
without you..

22:53.510 --> 22:55.142
...Batman would have
never succeeded.

22:55.144 --> 22:58.411
Sir, you mean, you knew
that I was brainwashed?

22:58.413 --> 22:59.278
We certainly did.

22:59.280 --> 23:02.114
That's why Batman made sure
you had the information

23:02.116 --> 23:05.984
so that you in turn
could pass it on to Penguin.

23:05.986 --> 23:07.352
We were all prepared, Alfred.

23:07.354 --> 23:09.320
Even pretending to be
unconscious

23:09.322 --> 23:11.155
when Finella popped out
of the cake

23:11.157 --> 23:12.656
and used the gas umbrella.

23:12.658 --> 23:16.192
And speaking of Ms. Finella..

23:20.030 --> 23:21.463
I see that you
got my invitation

23:21.465 --> 23:23.965
but I never thought
that you would make it.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.467
I brought her
down for the party myself.

23:26.469 --> 23:28.135
I'm so happy to be here.

23:28.137 --> 23:30.270
And, oh, thank you,
for the coat.

23:30.272 --> 23:31.471
I don't deserve it.

23:31.473 --> 23:33.973
But we millionaires
decided that you do.

23:33.975 --> 23:37.009
After all, did you
not assist Batman and Robin

23:37.011 --> 23:37.576
in capturing the--

23:37.578 --> 23:40.311
Please, don't mention his name.

23:40.313 --> 23:43.380
When I think that
I almost helped him get away

23:43.382 --> 23:44.247
with all those millions.

23:44.249 --> 23:46.249
Almost, but not quite,
little lady.

23:46.251 --> 23:49.018
That's why we managed
to get permission for you.

23:49.020 --> 23:52.321
That Batman,
such a wonderful person.

23:52.323 --> 23:57.225
Mr. Wayne, do you think that
I'll ever get to see him again?

23:57.227 --> 23:59.026
Who knows, my dear?

23:59.028 --> 24:00.861
Perhaps, someday you may.

24:00.863 --> 24:03.063
Now, may I help you
with your wrap?

24:03.065 --> 24:04.330
- Oh.
- It's alright.

24:04.332 --> 24:07.166
You're amongst friends here.

24:09.035 --> 24:10.702
Take it.

24:10.904 --> 24:14.805
Well, someday when you've paid
your debts to society

24:14.807 --> 24:16.173
you may be released from prison

24:16.175 --> 24:19.376
not only for one day
but forever.

24:19.378 --> 24:20.677
Oh.
