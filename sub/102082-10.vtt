VOICEOVER: Previously on Harrow...

00:02.480 --> 00:05.760
HARROW: There was a dead young man
who I thought was my son,

00:05.760 --> 00:07.720
and the DNA results came in.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.280
There was more than one person
at the shipyard

00:09.280 --> 00:11.120
when our victim fell to his death.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.360
Hi, Dad.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.040
Is James in trouble?

00:14.040 --> 00:17.400
I'm not sure he wasn't involved
in that boy's death.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.320
I'm not sure I can believe
a word he's told me.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.920
Mum had this record too.
Did she play it much?

00:22.920 --> 00:24.560
Only when she thought
no-one was listening.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.960
You lied to me, Mum.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.840
I guess I learned that
from somewhere.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.760
TANYA: Daniel,
did you take the towel?

00:29.760 --> 00:32.520
GRACE: Who you invite between
your sheets is none of my business.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.040
I used to be a neurosurgeon.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.800
This boy had a tumour.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.560
The boy who woke up lost speech,
he'd lost movement.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.440
After that, I found it really hard
to go with confidence into a brain.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.560
Where is your mother?

00:44.560 --> 00:45.840
RENAE: Louie.
Oh, here.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.040
What on Earth are you doing
letting my son in here?

00:48.040 --> 00:50.480
I didn't even know you had a son.
Can I see an autopsy?

00:50.480 --> 00:53.040
Absolutely not.
Of course you can, Louie.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.920
I need those reports
you made on Dr Harrow,

00:54.920 --> 00:57.680
as his supervisor,
on my desk this afternoon.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.120
You were in Harrow's email. Tell me
what the hell you were doing.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.400
None of your business.
He's my girlfriend's father.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.880
He's my father.
And it's my business.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.480
FERN: How did you get in there,
anyway?

01:07.480 --> 01:09.000
Got this from his backpack.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.640
There were rows and rows
of operators ripping people off.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.400
That's what your brother was into.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.640
It wasn't me who stole her money.
It was Max.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.560
He was going to skip the country,
and then he fell.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.760
And the footage on your phone
will prove this?

01:21.760 --> 01:23.920
Which is why I need to get it back.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.280
If you don't want to help James,
that is fine.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.080
But he's my brother
and I'm going to help him.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.040
Looking for Harrow?
No. For you.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.280
I need you to do something.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.440
The evidence box is available
to be collected tomorrow afternoon.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.840
Can I see some ID please?

01:36.840 --> 01:39.200
You are Catherine Schumann.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.400
What have you got Fern involved in?

01:41.400 --> 01:43.120
I'll take that, thanks.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.600
That's not his phone.
It's his sister's phone.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.840
No!
What have you two done?

05:01.840 --> 05:03.800
Is this because he was
in the police system?

via Cape Town

07:35.160 --> 07:36.840
was opened for routine inspection.

That's weeks at sea.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.600
Did he suffocate?

07:42.600 --> 07:44.000
The shipping container was vented.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.400
Was he alone?

07:45.400 --> 07:46.760
Technically, no.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.000
Had about three dozen
exotic birds with him.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.840
Clearly for sale
on the black market.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.600
Unfortunately, it looks like they
didn't cope with the heat, either.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.600
You think dehydration?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.440
All his water bottles were bone-dry.

But, you know, sing out if
you find anything noteworthy.

then it won't do him any good,

it could slow it down and save him.

you stole that animal.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.240
But I need to know how it died.

28:28.560 --> 28:32.160
Did it die of the disease
or did you kill it?

28:33.920 --> 28:35.960
A boy's life depends on it!

28:48.160 --> 28:50.400

I have the monkey.

It's a macaque. It's dead.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.960

No. Broken neck.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.080
It was a carrier,

29:11.080 --> 29:13.400
but no swollen glands
or any other symptoms,

29:13.400 --> 29:15.600

'Cause you're leaving too.

what really happened

his daughter were working together.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.840
Lying about their knowledge
that Harrow's son is here?

Yes.

Lying about a young man
who is wanted for murder.

of the State Coroner,

while allowing his daughter to
steal from right under our noses.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.840
It was Max's idea
to steal your money.

35:08.840 --> 35:12.760
He said he'd split it
with me if I helped him.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.760
If I got him out of the country.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.400
You knew he was going
to try something.

so I set up some insurance.

in Max's fake passport

you had intended to leave for me,

45:20.360 --> 45:22.320
I'm not sure I'd want you to.

45:24.880 --> 45:27.600
(PHONE CHIMES)
MAN: Dr Molyneaux?

45:29.600 --> 45:31.680
You should get checked too,
monkey man.

45:31.680 --> 45:37.120
I'm not contagious, but,
look, I'll check in on you there?

45:38.280 --> 45:40.320
Get yourself right first.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.040
Then come and see me.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.840
You going to see your dad?

46:17.840 --> 46:21.160
Wow, you detectives are amazing.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.480
You and I need to have
a serious chat

46:24.480 --> 46:26.720
about Catherine Schumann.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.400
I know.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.480
I'm not going anywhere.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.080
OK.

46:42.440 --> 46:44.480
Dad.
Where's your boat?

46:49.040 --> 46:50.200
"Dear Dad...

46:50.200 --> 46:53.480
"Well, Mum told me the truth,
so I guess 'Dr Harrow'.

46:58.120 --> 46:59.360
"It's a shame.

46:59.360 --> 47:02.280
"I think you'd have been
if not a good Dad,

47:02.280 --> 47:03.680
"a very interesting one.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.480
"Except for the whole phone thing.

47:05.480 --> 47:07.080
"So with that in mind,

47:07.080 --> 47:10.000
"I hope you understand why
I've done what I've done.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.840
"Maybe it will be good for you too.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.480
"Change can be good, right?

47:15.720 --> 47:17.040
"Take care of Fern.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.320
"James."

47:22.920 --> 47:24.280
He isn't my brother?

47:25.600 --> 47:26.760
No.

47:26.760 --> 47:28.480
James Reed is a liar.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.160
And a sneak.

47:30.160 --> 47:31.360
And a charmer.

47:31.360 --> 47:34.560
So he certainly fits
the bill as Harrow's son.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.800
But, no, he's, uh...
He's not your brother.

47:39.440 --> 47:42.600
Oh, well, guess I'd better
ring the coast guard.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.000
Let's give him a head start.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.200
Well, how long?

47:46.200 --> 47:47.600
Another 22 years?

47:49.480 --> 47:52.520
His mother kept
the truth from him too.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.400
Alright, it's your boat.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.760
But I need you to come in
for a full statement.

47:57.760 --> 48:00.360
And I hear you'd better get
some blood tests taken.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.280
Yes, sir.

48:04.360 --> 48:05.640
Fern?

48:07.520 --> 48:09.040
Righto.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.040
Thanks for the money.

48:18.040 --> 48:20.000
The 22 million?

48:20.000 --> 48:23.960
I wasn't sure
I'd remembered your account number.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.960
No, you got it right.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.480
I suppose we should give it back.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.640
I suppose we should.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.800
Or...

48:42.520 --> 48:44.080
..Bora Bora.
(CHUCKLES)

48:44.080 --> 48:45.720
But we don't have a boat.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.280
Well...

48:47.280 --> 48:49.720
..we could go shopping.

48:49.720 --> 48:51.080
Can Callan come?

48:51.080 --> 48:52.600
Of course.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.000
Every good vessel needs a cook.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.880
What will I do?
Well, I heard you could clean.

48:57.880 --> 48:59.080
(CHUCKLES)

48:59.080 --> 49:01.360
If it's my money,
I'll be the master.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.680
Fine. Then I'll be ship's doctor.

49:03.680 --> 49:04.880
Fine.

49:04.880 --> 49:06.720
But you don't get to pick
all the music.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.920
I will pick all the music,
and the provisions.

49:09.920 --> 49:12.520
No, I hate whisky.

49:12.520 --> 49:14.600
Let me tell you about whisky.
Oh...

49:14.600 --> 49:17.840
You see, the name comes
from the old Gaelic "uisce beatha",

49:17.840 --> 49:19.520
which means "water of life"...
Stop.

49:19.520 --> 49:21.960
You just don't know when to stop,
do you?

49:21.960 --> 49:23.320
No, no, no, no.

49:23.320 --> 49:27.120
It's important that
the shipmates understand each other

49:27.120 --> 49:28.560
and respect their preferences.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.680
All you'd have to respect is that

49:30.680 --> 49:33.160
I'll have the bed and control
of the menu.

49:33.160 --> 49:34.680
What?! Never.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.960
(BOTH CONTINUE
CHATTING INDISTINCTLY)
