WEBVTT

00:04.400 --> 00:05.880
I'm not narcing.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.160
Now, what I want
from you, Bert,

00:07.280 --> 00:08.880
is for you to do your
country a service.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.320
[inaudible],, you
here to pitch in?

00:10.440 --> 00:11.240
Yeah.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.800
Yeah, sure.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.680
Tell me, Ted, where do youstand on the bloody tour?

00:14.800 --> 00:16.440
So they're getting theirmoney out of South Africa.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.400
Rich, redneck boers.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.760
Half a million's OK?

00:19.880 --> 00:22.040
Then we'll smash
them at the rugby tour.

00:22.160 --> 00:22.960
Bring on the tour.

00:28.920 --> 00:29.720
Any sign?

00:29.840 --> 00:30.600
No.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.240
They'll be here.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.000
So does Bilkey still get acut, even though he's not here?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.920
Yes.
It's gang rules.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.040
Not his fault he was in Sydneywhen the word came through.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.320
We're good to go, Ted.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.040
The Yarpies are here, and,we speak, on their way

00:42.160 --> 00:45.760
to Gisborne for the first game.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.160
Here's the motel
where they're staying.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.040
We beat them here.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.360
That's all.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.120
Des said they might
have other appointments.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.360
Checking out the land nearby.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.440
One of them said
they'll be visiting

00:54.560 --> 00:56.120
a lion safari park in Massey.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.440
They may be driving down
to Gizzy after that.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.000
Why are they going
to the Lion Safari Park

01:00.120 --> 01:01.160
when they're from Africa?

01:01.280 --> 01:02.320
Don't they have
enough lions there?

01:02.440 --> 01:03.280
I don't know.
'Cause it's the only

01:03.400 --> 01:04.240
tourist attraction we have?

01:04.360 --> 01:05.480
What about [inaudible].

01:05.600 --> 01:07.320
Carol loves to throw
coins in the creek

01:07.440 --> 01:09.840
and watch the littleAmericans dive after them.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.640
Yeah, I don't think theYarpies would be into that.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.840
Maybe pushing the littleAmericans off the bridge.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.160
The point is, they'll
be here, with the cash.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.440
They're carrying it
with them till they

01:17.560 --> 01:19.520
head back to Auckland,
hand it over to Des.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.600
Why?

01:21.720 --> 01:22.800
Why what?

01:22.920 --> 01:23.480
Why are they
carrying it with them?

01:23.600 --> 01:24.680
I don't know.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.960
Because they wanna
keep an eye on it?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.280
Look, I'm just telling
you what Des said.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.480
Well, why can't we
snatch it in Auckland?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.240
Yes, I asked him
the same question.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.800
You don't shit in
your own nest, Ted.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.800
I don't want anything
linking me to this job.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.920
It's got to happen far away frommy vicinity, like in Gisborne.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.520
And make it look like kids, eh?

01:40.640 --> 01:41.440
What?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.640
Chance robbery, bad luck.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.000
Makes sense, I guess.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.040
So do we actuallytrust a scumbag like Des?

01:47.160 --> 01:47.960
Yo, yo, yo.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.000
Big fellas.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.800
Do we know what they're
carrying the cash in?

01:58.920 --> 02:00.240
Fuck, I don't know.
A bag.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.680
I wasn't about to askfor a bloody description.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.440
How did they get allthe cash through customs?

02:03.560 --> 02:04.520
Contacts, hush money.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.520
Fuck knows.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.800
The dough is in Gisborne.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.280
What more do you need to know?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.160
So our job is to
find it, take it,

02:10.280 --> 02:14.040
be home with our lovelyladies before we know it.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.000
THEME SONG: Watch your back.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.960
Watch your back.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.480
When you're walking
down the alleys.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.360
Watch your back.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.360
Watch your back.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.240
When you're out on the streets.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.200
and there's a strangeron the street these days.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.640
You can't see it through
the fog and haze.

02:29.760 --> 02:36.920
When everybody's going crazy,everybody's going crazy,

02:37.040 --> 02:38.840
everybody's going crazy.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.720
I do love to Ted, but
it's quieter, tidier.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.400
There's less mess.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.200
I love not cooking, getting aburger from Uncle's, if I want.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.840
No constant pestering
for slap and tickle.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.320
You don't like
the slap and tickle?

02:56.440 --> 02:57.480
I always like it.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.880
Carol, please
don't start talking

02:59.000 --> 03:00.240
about Phineas's cock again.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.120
Why not?

03:01.240 --> 03:02.320
It's a lovely cock.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.040
[crying]

03:04.160 --> 03:05.000
Chelsea?

03:05.120 --> 03:05.920
CHELSEA: Mum!

03:09.000 --> 03:12.840
Darling, what's wrong?

03:12.960 --> 03:15.280
There was a man!

03:15.400 --> 03:17.760
[screaming]

03:21.840 --> 03:23.120
He grabbed the
sleeve of her cardigan.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.760
She wriggled out of itand ran all the way home.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.040
She wasn't--

03:29.160 --> 03:30.320
Thank God for that.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.680
She was lucky.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.720
I suppose we
should tell someone.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.920
She means, call the cops.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.720
It's what they're
there for, right?

03:43.840 --> 03:47.720
So you were about here, anda bloke appears from here.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.200
He tries to grab you, there'sa struggle, and you get away.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.640
He had the sleeve
of her cardigan.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.040
She managed to get out of it.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.720
She's already told
you all of this.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.240
We like to be thorough, makesure the facts don't change.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.480
And what color's this cardi?- It's green.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.520
Still green.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.360
Let them do their job, Rita.

04:02.480 --> 04:06.560
We got a green cardi anywhere?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.360
So this bloke's
stolen your cardi.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.520
Excuse me.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.560
Are you actually
taking the piss?

04:11.680 --> 04:14.360
No, the cardi's
definitely missing.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.320
And you got a good
look at this guy?

04:16.440 --> 04:20.440
For God's sake, shealready said, white skin,

04:20.560 --> 04:24.200
medium height, medium build.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.480
Would you say he was handsome?

04:26.600 --> 04:27.960
What do the kids say these days?

04:28.080 --> 04:29.920
Was he spunky?

04:30.040 --> 04:33.080
What the fuck kind
of a question is that?

04:33.200 --> 04:35.160
A man tried to
rape my daughter,

04:35.280 --> 04:37.840
and you're talking aboutcardis and was he handsome.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.040
"Rape" is a bit strong.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.280
If she hadn't
managed to get away--

04:40.400 --> 04:43.080
If there was a bloke at all.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.640
Sorry?

04:44.760 --> 04:47.440
Look, we get this all thetime, girls who are a bit--

04:47.560 --> 04:48.880
you know, who don't
get enough attention.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.520
They can have these
little fantasies.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.000
Or she lost her cardi andshe didn't wanna tell you.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.120
Fucking hell, no.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.120
So you're saying,
she made it up?

04:55.240 --> 04:56.040
I didn't!

04:56.160 --> 04:57.560
We know, sweetheart.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.400
Before we go wastingpolice' time, we have to look

04:59.520 --> 05:00.480
at all the possibilities.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.600
You fucking bastard!

05:02.720 --> 05:03.880
Swearing at a police officer?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.560
You sure that's wise, love?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.800
Over here.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.840
So who's making things up?

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
Should you be touching this?

05:11.080 --> 05:12.000
If there are
fingerprints, you're

05:12.120 --> 05:13.600
contaminating the evidence.

05:13.720 --> 05:16.120
Jesus, they can't even
do their bloody job!

05:16.240 --> 05:17.600
We've got the
girl's statement.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.120
We'll let you know ifthere are any developments.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.000
Wanker!

05:24.640 --> 05:26.040
They are pigs, aren't they?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.480
There's a reason
we call them that.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.600
She's all right.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.520
Asking for a milo.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.840
Those bloody bastards!

05:39.960 --> 05:42.440
Making out that Chelsea's--

05:42.560 --> 05:43.560
that she's plain.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.240
They're are all
pricks, Ngaire.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.360
We already know this.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.400
I mean, I know
she's no Desiree,

05:47.520 --> 05:48.880
but she'll grow into herself.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.880
I mean, she can get contactlenses when she's older.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.640
Chelsea is a very pretty girl.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.960
One day, she will be.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.600
For sure.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.080
The important thing is thatthere is a pervert out there,

05:59.200 --> 06:01.200
and the police just
don't give a stuff.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.440
It's not right.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.520
It's not bloody right.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.200
[moaning]

06:11.200 --> 06:12.920
Ev-- evening, Mrs. West.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.920
Uh, how are you on
this beautiful evening?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.080
Fine, thanks.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.040
How's the blue movie?
- Oh, what?

06:17.160 --> 06:18.160
No.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.120
No, we wouldn't
watch blue movies.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.560
No, we was watching--

06:20.680 --> 06:22.000
[interposing voices]

06:22.120 --> 06:24.280
I don't actually careif you watch that rubbish.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.880
In fact, if it keeps men offthe street, where they force

06:27.000 --> 06:28.920
themselves on women, then good.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.560
We wouldn't force
ourselves on anyone.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.480
I'm not talking about you lot.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.800
One of Ngaire's girls
was attacked down

06:35.920 --> 06:36.920
at Swan Arch Park.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.400
Someone tried
to molest Desiree?

06:38.520 --> 06:39.960
- No, not Desiree.
- The little one?

06:40.080 --> 06:40.840
That's horrible.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.400
No, the middle one.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.280
Chelsea?

06:43.400 --> 06:44.920
Chelsea gets some, eh?

06:45.040 --> 06:46.200
[chuckling]

06:46.320 --> 06:48.160
What the fuck is
funny about a young girl

06:48.280 --> 06:50.520
almost being raped onher way home from school?

06:50.640 --> 06:51.440
Sorry, nothing.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.960
You seem to think so.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.960
Well, it's just that,Chelsea, she's, you know, plain.

06:56.080 --> 06:56.840
And a four eyes.

06:56.960 --> 06:57.760
I think she's nice.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.320
Oh, for God's sake.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.880
You're as bad as
the bloody cops.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.240
They don't even care thatthis guy is still out there!

07:04.360 --> 07:06.840
Oh, here he is, the
working class hero.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.000
Sit on it, Eric.

07:08.120 --> 07:08.960
Leave your muddy boots--

07:09.080 --> 07:10.360
Outside, I know.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.640
Dinner won't be long.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.640
I've just been dealing
with something.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.840
There's a perv in
the neighborhood.

07:15.960 --> 07:16.800
Yeah?

07:16.920 --> 07:17.720
So?

07:17.840 --> 07:18.680
No, not them.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.240
They're just silly boys.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.640
Saw Evan Lace today.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.840
Yeah?

07:26.960 --> 07:29.080
Out in the distance,
driving away.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.800
Thought this job was meantto get me closer to him.

07:30.920 --> 07:31.880
It's a job.
It's a start.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.240
Mum, it's the pits.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.600
It's the absolute pits.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.760
And the foreman's a prick--

07:35.880 --> 07:37.680
Wolf, you have to be patient.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.560
And have a shower.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.000
You smell like shit.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.320
Yeah, because I've beenstanding in shit all day.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.280
You've got BO, man.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.160
I haven't got BO.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.080
It's your farts.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.160
You were farting too.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.520
So glad we got
here a day early,

07:47.640 --> 07:50.560
Ted, so we can stare at
a bunch of motel rooms,

07:50.680 --> 07:53.040
with a bunch of Yarpies
inside going nowhere.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.280
At least all the cops willbe at the stadium, I suppose.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.160
Oi, we've got movement.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.760
About fucking time.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.920
All right, Bert, Lefty,
you follow the Yarpies.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.520
Phin and I will do the rooms.- Hang on, I--

08:04.640 --> 08:05.840
I should be doing
the rooms with you.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.320
Last time I needed
you to watch my back,

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
you disappeared on me.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.120
It was different.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.800
Besides, those two will blendin much better around Gisborne

08:11.920 --> 08:12.960
than me.

08:13.080 --> 08:13.960
Why, because I'm merry?

08:14.080 --> 08:14.840
Yeah.

08:14.960 --> 08:15.760
I'm not merry

08:15.880 --> 08:16.720
OK, enough.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.320
Lefty, with me.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.200
You guys, if they start tohead back, Phineas stalls them,

08:20.320 --> 08:21.920
Bert legs it to warn us.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.160
OK?

08:23.280 --> 08:24.040
Yeah.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.120
All right, let's kick
off this bloody tour.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.880
[knocking on door]

08:44.360 --> 08:45.840
Come in.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.600
Mrs. Ted West
requests my company,

08:47.720 --> 08:48.920
I'm not about to say no.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.240
If it's about your
husband, I'm all ears.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.520
It's about how there
is a pervert running

08:53.640 --> 08:56.200
around the bloody neighborhood,attacking young women,

08:56.320 --> 08:58.480
and your people are
doing fuck all about it.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.280
Did you not know?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.800
No, I didn't know.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.160
Bloody typical.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.520
I'm not the only cop
in West Auckland, Rita.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.640
We have departments, you know.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.400
Department of tits on a bull.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.120
So you've called
me here to what?

09:12.240 --> 09:15.640
Tell me off for
not doing my job?

09:15.760 --> 09:18.520
Oh, this is gold, this is.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.800
A young girl was attacked inSwan Arch park on her way home

09:21.920 --> 09:23.160
from school.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.000
The cop made fun of the
victim, made her cry,

09:26.120 --> 09:29.160
and then threatened toarrest the victim's mother!

09:29.280 --> 09:32.080
Is that how you cops do
your jobs these days?

09:32.200 --> 09:32.960
What cop?

09:33.080 --> 09:33.960
Your mate.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.320
You know, Terry what's his name.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.200
I'll look into it.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.120
Look into what?

09:37.240 --> 09:39.720
Your own bumhole?

09:39.840 --> 09:42.520
Lovely chatting
with you, Rita.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.120
We're people too, you know.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.800
Whatever you might
think of us, our kids,

09:45.920 --> 09:47.200
they deserve protection too!

10:00.200 --> 10:02.720
You know, they'd have to bepretty stupid, wouldn't they?

10:02.840 --> 10:04.200
To leave so much money
in the motel room

10:04.320 --> 10:05.560
while they go to the rugby.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.600
Especially in a dodgy
town like Gisborne.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.760
Check everywhere.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.200
There's no reason we have towatch them from here, right?

10:16.320 --> 10:19.440
We can go in, watch
them, and have a beer.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.800
So what if we go in, andwe're ordering our beer,

10:21.920 --> 10:23.000
and they decide to leave?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.200
Well, then we
drink really fast.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.160
Shit.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.920
What are you doing?

10:33.040 --> 10:34.880
I thought the South
Africans were coming.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.440
No, they're still inside.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.720
There's just some
protesters here.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.360
OK, everyone remember
which sign you had.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.960
What do you reckon wouldhappen if the Yarpies

10:44.080 --> 10:45.760
met the protesters?

10:45.880 --> 10:46.840
Oh, hang on.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.280
Here they come now.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.520
Well, what have we got here?Bloody communists?

10:49.640 --> 10:50.640
It's better than
being a racist.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.200
You really wanna
do politics now, eh?

10:56.320 --> 10:58.080
- OK, that's what happens.- We should do something.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.680
Like show our faces tothe jokers we're gonna rob?

11:01.800 --> 11:05.560
Also, they look well
handy with their fists.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.000
Leave him alone, you bastards.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.920
Step away, or I'll smash
you, you pieces of shit,

11:09.040 --> 11:10.880
you cowards!

11:11.000 --> 11:11.920
Oh, leave it, Gibbler.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.240
They're bloody savages.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.680
Yeah, might catch their lice.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.000
[laughter]

11:25.280 --> 11:26.680
Geez, that chick is hard out.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.400
Am I in trouble?

11:35.520 --> 11:36.680
Of course not.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.040
We just wanna go over
the facts one more

11:38.160 --> 11:40.040
time, make sure we've
got everything right.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.000
So you were coming home
through Swan Arch Park.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.760
Was there anyone else around?

11:44.880 --> 11:48.080
No, I was a bit late,
because I had practice.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.040
Netball?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.080
Trampoline.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.800
I'm on the school team.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.040
[snorting]

11:55.280 --> 11:56.600
You wanna wait
in the car, Terry?

11:56.720 --> 11:57.800
We asked all this already.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.240
So you finished trampolinepractice at what time?

12:05.360 --> 12:06.600
4:30.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.040
Which means you were
coming through the park

12:08.160 --> 12:10.320
at maybe quarter to 5:00?

12:10.440 --> 12:11.760
CHELSEA: Yes.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.920
And did you feel likeanyone was following you?

12:16.040 --> 12:17.520
No.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.040
MIKE: Which means he was waitingfor someone to come along.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.040
[screaming]

12:24.160 --> 12:25.240
That's important.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.680
You're doing really
great, Chelsea.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.720
Make sure she walks home fromschool with friends from now.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.520
She's a bit of a loner.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.320
Maybe I'll just pick
her up everyday.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.200
Is your husband around?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.280
He's away.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.160
Business, is it?

12:39.280 --> 12:40.560
I should get back to Chelsea.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.360
No, look, the onlyreason I ask is, well, you

12:42.480 --> 12:44.800
and your girls here byyourselves, it's not ideal.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.440
We're fine, thanks.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.680
Well, there are things youcan do to keep yourself safe.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.640
I can drop in a pamphlet.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.560
Or actually, I can do
one better than that.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.800
There's a meeting
tonight, if you're free.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.680
What sort of meeting?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.000
Neighborhood watch.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.600
Why not?

12:59.720 --> 13:01.440
It might be fun, meeting thepeople in our neighborhood.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.400
We only have to pop
our heads in Rita.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.720
If we don't like
it, we can leave.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.760
It's not here, Ted.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.840
[inaudible] socks,
[inaudible] socks.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.160
Fuck this.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.880
I'm only going off
what Des McEwen said.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.520
Des McEwen is a
bullshit artist.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.360
Bingo.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.120
Fuck.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.600
What the hell is this?

13:35.720 --> 13:36.800
It's biltong.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.080
What the fuck is
fucking bitlong?

13:38.200 --> 13:39.600
Dried meat.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.880
Jesus, we're rich.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.120
Repack everything,
the way we found it.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.440
Eh?

13:48.560 --> 13:49.680
They can't know that
anyone's been here.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.960
But you said make
it look like kids,

13:51.080 --> 13:52.360
so we made it look like kids.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.760
Well, if the money's
somewhere else,

13:53.880 --> 13:54.960
we don't wanna scare them off.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.280
What do you mean,
somewhere else?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.520
Well, you're the one
who said "why would

13:57.640 --> 13:58.920
you bring it to Gisborne?"

13:59.040 --> 14:00.320
Everything back the
way we found it.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.000
The other room too.

14:02.120 --> 14:02.920
Ugh!

14:05.920 --> 14:08.200
Should have brought
the bloody women.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.600
I hate these kind of people,twitching their curtains,

14:14.720 --> 14:16.680
peering over their fences.

14:16.800 --> 14:21.840
They might all be nice, normalpeople, just the same as us.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.240
Ugh.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.840
Well, here we are again.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.880
Thank you all for
coming tonight.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.200
[doorbell ringing]

14:31.240 --> 14:33.000
Right.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.440
When Brian gets back, I'lljust whip through the agenda

14:35.560 --> 14:36.400
for tonight's meeting.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.280
This neighborhood watch?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.160
Yes.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.080
Good.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.040
Mike McArthy invited us.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.600
We're from the neighborhood.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.120
So any complaints you mighthave, take it up with him.

14:49.240 --> 14:53.520
No, no.Everyone is welcome here.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.800
I'm Brian.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.000
My good wife, Wendy.

14:56.120 --> 14:56.920
I'm Ngaire.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.920
I'm Carol.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.400
And this is Rita.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.400
Take a seat.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.280
Right.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.560
Right, then.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.600
Where were we?

15:05.720 --> 15:06.840
- The agenda.
- That's right.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.280
The agenda.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.960
Item one, apologies, thereare none, since we're

15:11.080 --> 15:13.560
all here, plus some new people.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.120
Uh, item two, the
clothesline thefts.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.480
Really?

15:17.600 --> 15:18.720
Someone's been nicking
stuff off washing lines?

15:18.840 --> 15:19.640
Oh, yes.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.320
Wendy's smalls were taken.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.720
Amongst some other things fromaround the neighborhood, Brian.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.960
Probably the same
bloody pervert.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.400
Well, same pervert as what?

15:26.520 --> 15:28.560
The pervert that attackedmy daughter yesterday.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.240
Really?

15:30.360 --> 15:31.920
That's terrible.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.120
I always knew the
underwear stealing

15:33.240 --> 15:34.200
was just him getting started.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.760
- Him who?
- Sorry?

15:35.880 --> 15:37.160
Well, do you know
who this person is?

15:37.280 --> 15:38.600
No.
No, we don't.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.040
Any ideas?

15:40.160 --> 15:43.240
I mean, you are the oneswatching the neighborhood.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.800
No, sorry.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.520
Anyway, moving on.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.880
Uh, item three--

15:49.000 --> 15:50.880
I might just skip past
item three, actually.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.440
Item four, vandalism.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.520
Now, somebody spray
painted the litter boxes

15:54.640 --> 15:56.640
in number 23 and number 58.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.840
But what about the
real issue, the pervert

15:59.960 --> 16:02.280
attacking young girls
in Swan Arch Pack?

16:02.400 --> 16:03.960
Or clotheslines
and letterboxes

16:04.080 --> 16:06.520
boxes, as far as you guys go?

16:06.640 --> 16:08.240
[doorbell rings]

16:08.360 --> 16:09.840
Oh, that'll be
the guest speaker.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.480
Item five, guest speaker.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.800
No, no, I'll get him.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.360
So what happened
to item three?

16:16.480 --> 16:19.760
We can come back to that,if we've got some time.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.800
Hi, Mike.

16:20.920 --> 16:21.680
G'day, Wendy.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.600
Evening, all.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.480
You came.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.280
Beauty.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.600
Yes, there are
prowlers out there.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.480
That is an unfortunate
fact of life these days.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.640
So you ladies especially need totake precautions to stay safe.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.320
If you live alone, you couldput a pair of men's shoes

16:37.440 --> 16:39.240
at your front door,
so an intruder will

16:39.360 --> 16:41.000
think that a man is present.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.640
What if the intruder
nicks the shoes?

16:42.760 --> 16:45.400
Well, there's that ad
on TV, with the knock

16:45.520 --> 16:48.520
at the door and the womanyells out "I'll get it, Jim."

16:48.640 --> 16:50.200
Who's Jim? are they his shoes?

16:50.320 --> 16:51.080
No.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.240
There's-- there's no Jim.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.600
She's pretending
there's a man there,

16:53.720 --> 16:54.960
so she doesn't get attacked.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.240
Or the lady could learn
how to defend herself.

16:57.360 --> 17:00.240
There's a good course
at the community center.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.400
I strongly recommend it.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.840
[murmuring]

17:11.800 --> 17:13.920
That was actually
almost useful.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.920
Wendy and Brian were nice.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.160
Oh, you think
so, do you Carol?

17:18.280 --> 17:20.600
Item three, the one
we skipped over.

17:23.800 --> 17:27.760
85, John Morgan Street,update, comings, goings, latest

17:27.880 --> 17:30.880
suspicious behavior.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.320
Hey, that's here.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.840
Oh my god.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.760
Neighborhood watch
are watching you.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.080
They think that we
are bloody criminals!

17:39.200 --> 17:41.200
OK, that makes sense now.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.400
What does?

17:42.520 --> 17:43.640
What Wendy was asking.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.760
So they've Got.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.920
A couple of foster
kids, do they?

17:46.040 --> 17:46.920
Oh, you mean Sparky.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.160
Is he the-- the brown?

17:48.280 --> 17:49.560
No, that's Falani.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.560
He doesn't live there,
but he might as well.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.360
So Sparky is the retarded one?

17:53.480 --> 17:54.920
Oh, he's not retarded.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.400
His mother was a druggy, andshe took off to Australia.

17:57.520 --> 18:01.160
And then his dad died
in a workplace accident.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.720
And his sister,
she's a punk rocker.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.040
She went to Dunedin.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.080
He had no one.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.680
So Rita took pity on him.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.080
Right.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.240
Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.120
There is a dangerous
pervert out there,

18:14.240 --> 18:16.440
and those wallies are
sitting around, drinking

18:16.560 --> 18:19.400
tea, and judging my family?

18:19.520 --> 18:23.440
Well, fuck them and the
horse they rode in on.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.840
[music playing]

18:31.240 --> 18:32.520
DES [ON PHONE]: McEwen.

18:32.640 --> 18:36.240
I've been trying to
get hold of you all day.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.560
The South Africans
don't have the money.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.360
Oh, yeah, there's
been a change of plans.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.440
They were worried about gettingall that cash through customs,

18:41.560 --> 18:43.960
so it's catching them up.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.160
When?

18:45.280 --> 18:46.080
I don't know.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.080
Well, how?

18:47.200 --> 18:48.440
DES [ON PHONE]: I don't know.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.320
Jesus, Des, you could
have fucking told us!

18:50.440 --> 18:51.560
How?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.040
You got a phone in
your van, have you?

18:53.160 --> 18:53.960
Do you carry a phone aroundin your fucking pocket?

18:54.080 --> 18:55.520
Look, it's just a hitch.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.680
I'll let you know more whenyou get back to Auckland,

18:56.800 --> 18:57.560
for fuck's sake.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.520
[phone ringing]

19:07.640 --> 19:09.280
Hello.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.200
G'day, love.

19:11.320 --> 19:12.560
Where are you?

19:12.680 --> 19:14.560
TED [ON PHONE]: Pub in
the ass-end of nowhere.

19:14.680 --> 19:15.560
Celebrating?

19:15.680 --> 19:16.480
Hah.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.800
I wish.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.520
Drowning our sorrows.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.000
Job went a bit tits up.

19:21.120 --> 19:21.920
What happened?

19:22.040 --> 19:23.640
Ah, she'll be all right.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.080
Missing you, though, love.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.480
Oh, Jesus, you must bedown, getting all soppy on me.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.800
Nah, Lefty's been
giving me grief.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.000
You know what he's like.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.560
Well, tell him to--

19:39.680 --> 19:42.760
actually, tell him to
give his wife a ring.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.560
Tell him to check how
she and his daughters

19:44.680 --> 19:46.200
are doing for once in his life.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.680
Why can't I ride my bike?

19:47.800 --> 19:48.720
Because I'm driving you.

19:48.840 --> 19:49.640
Let's go, Chelsea!

19:53.120 --> 19:53.920
Chelsea!

19:56.520 --> 19:57.280
Oops.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.680
Good timing.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.640
I was just about todrop the girls to school.

20:00.760 --> 20:01.560
Oh.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.960
OK, I can come back.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.240
What was it about?

20:04.360 --> 20:05.440
I just need to get
another description

20:05.560 --> 20:06.960
from Chelsea, actually.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.520
Oh?

20:08.640 --> 20:09.880
Yeah, I've had a tip-offfrom a member of the public.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.920
I just need to rule
this guy out, really.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.040
Was the guy pale-skinned?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.840
A little bit pasty?

20:15.960 --> 20:18.000
Um, I'm not sure.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.200
Stocky build?

20:19.320 --> 20:20.560
Stocky?

20:20.680 --> 20:23.720
You know, sort of short
but broad across here.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.680
I'm-- I'm not sure.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.320
And you didn't
see his hair color?

20:28.440 --> 20:32.240
Couldn't have been gingerish?

20:32.360 --> 20:34.400
You didn't recognizeanything about this fella?

20:34.520 --> 20:36.680
Like it could have been
someone you might know?

20:36.800 --> 20:37.600
I don't know.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.200
It all happened too quick.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.720
It's Sparky.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.400
The attacker, the
police think it's him.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.040
Oh, for fuck's sake.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.560
Is that the piece that MikeMcArthy can come up with?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.080
He had a tip-off.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.160
From that bloody cow atneighborhood watch, I'll bet.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.040
You have to admit,
Sparky is odd.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.760
He's not rapist odd.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.640
Well, the policeobviously think that he--

20:58.760 --> 21:01.640
Ngaire, since when do
we listen to the cops?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.160
It isn't Sparky.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.560
My family needed me.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.160
You wouldn't have known that.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.440
And where was I?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.480
Doing sweet [inaudible]
in Gisborne,

21:11.600 --> 21:13.000
because you screwed up.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.280
I told you what Des said.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.560
Doesn't matter.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.920
You're making the calls,
the man in charge.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.520
Making us drive halfway
down the fucking island.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.320
Let's get you back
to your family, eh?

21:22.440 --> 21:24.520
Back with nothing to show.Nice road trip, Ted.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.640
Well, come on, Phineas.

21:35.760 --> 21:36.640
While we're still young, mate.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.320
Sparky, go and get me sometomatoes from that greenhouse

22:05.440 --> 22:08.800
on Hutchison Ave. Make sureyou put that in the [inaudible]

22:08.920 --> 22:10.120
box, all of it.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.320
[phone ringing]

23:00.000 --> 23:02.360
Hello?
MIKE [ON PHONE]: Ngaire?

23:02.480 --> 23:03.240
Mike McArthy.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.720
Have you found him?

23:04.840 --> 23:06.360
Not yet, but I have pulleda whole bunch of reports

23:06.480 --> 23:07.840
together, cops that
should have been talking

23:07.960 --> 23:09.040
to other bloody
cops, and there is

23:09.160 --> 23:10.800
definitely a bloke out there.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.960
So you're admitting my
girl didn't make it up.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.960
MIKE [ON PHONE]: Ngaire, I neverbelieved that for a second.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.200
That was lousy policing
all around, that was.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.080
But what I'm saying is, now thatI know for a fact the bastard's

23:20.200 --> 23:21.800
out there, I will catch him.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.720
Good to know, but excuseme if I don't hold my breath.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.840
I get that, but
you have my word.

23:28.960 --> 23:32.040
And the-- the other thingis, I was after a favor.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.240
From me?

23:33.360 --> 23:35.000
MIKE [ON PHONE]:
Sorry, I kind of don't

23:35.120 --> 23:37.040
have anyone else I can ask.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.800
Uh, the thing is, I've--

23:38.920 --> 23:41.760
I've got a daughter,
about Chelsea's age.

23:41.880 --> 23:42.840
A lot like Chelsea, really.

23:42.960 --> 23:45.520
Good kid, but a loner.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.480
Why are you telling me this?

23:47.600 --> 23:49.560
Well, the thing is, it's herbirthday, and I'm about to head

23:49.680 --> 23:51.640
to Henderson Square, and I'm--

23:51.760 --> 23:53.800
well, I'm buggered if Iknow what I'm gonna buy her.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.480
I thought maybe you couldgive me a couple of pointers?

23:56.600 --> 23:57.560
Me?

23:57.680 --> 23:58.880
Yeah, sorry.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.400
I didn't really have
anyone else I could ask.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.960
And if I screw up again
this year, well, I'm--

24:04.080 --> 24:05.200
I'm dead meat.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.960
Actually, I think I
can do better than that.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.440
I really appreciate your help.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.360
When I called, I thoughtyou would laugh and hang up.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.480
Well, you were lucky.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.640
I needed to get
out of the house.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.240
Yes, indeed, I was.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.360
This is gonna go down so muchbetter than the Sindy doll

24:25.480 --> 24:26.720
I got last year.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.760
You know, girls grow
up so fast these days.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.760
Tell me about it.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.560
Every time I see her, she'sgrown another six inches.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.480
She's not with you?

24:34.600 --> 24:35.360
No.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.240
No, she lives in Napier.

24:41.680 --> 24:47.360
Yeah, her mother, she took offfrom me, with another bloke.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.560
You get that sometimes.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.080
I was a bloody good husband.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.360
Faithful, attentive, everythingI did, I did for her.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.160
Still, it wasn't enough.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.760
Sometimes, no matter
how hard you try,

24:56.880 --> 24:58.760
they don't appreciate it.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.360
I guess.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.240
Wouldn't be so bad if the otherbloke wasn't a bloody cop.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.320
Sorry?

25:04.440 --> 25:05.320
Well, not an actual cop.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.920
MOT traffic officer.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.480
Bloody idiot thinks
he's Erik Estrada.

25:11.280 --> 25:15.480
Anyway, geez, you didn't
ask for my life story.

25:15.600 --> 25:16.400
It's fine.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.280
I know how it is.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.160
Believe me, I know.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.640
What happened here?

25:25.760 --> 25:27.160
Lefty, you-- you're home.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.280
I walk in here, the placeis like the Mary Celeste.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.840
After what you told me
last night, I thought--

25:31.960 --> 25:33.480
You were worried about me.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.440
Well, you know,
there's some dodgy

25:36.560 --> 25:37.800
bastard in the neighborhood.

25:37.920 --> 25:38.880
I'm fine.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.240
We're fine.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.360
The girls are at a
self defense course.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.400
Self defense?

25:44.520 --> 25:46.520
For girls?

25:46.640 --> 25:47.880
Oh, right.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.200
It's a good idea.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.120
It's been really
horrible, Lefty.

25:56.240 --> 25:59.720
How about I let youfinish making the dinner,

25:59.840 --> 26:01.680
and then you can
tell me all about it.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.240
How's it been?

26:11.360 --> 26:13.160
Well, first,
those neighborhood

26:13.280 --> 26:16.640
watch busybodies have decidedthat we are the biggest

26:16.760 --> 26:18.080
threats to this neighborhood.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.760
You and I. And now themand the cops, useless pigs,

26:21.880 --> 26:23.160
have decided that it's Sparky.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.600
No, I'm lost.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.640
They think that he's theone that attacked Chelsea!

26:29.760 --> 26:31.880
He's a couple sandwiches shortof a picnic, but he's no perv.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.480
Well, except that
I had to be sure,

26:36.600 --> 26:43.120
and so I went into his roomand I found some women's

26:43.240 --> 26:44.760
clothing hidden under the bed.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.240
Jesus.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.600
But it doesn't necessarilymean anything, right?

26:48.720 --> 26:49.480
Yeah, right.

26:55.800 --> 26:56.600
Doesn't it?

26:56.720 --> 26:57.480
I don't know.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.560
Oh, hello, love.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.800
So what's with the women'sclothes hidden in your room?

27:04.920 --> 27:05.840
For shit's sake, Ted.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.040
Well, you wanna
know, so we ask.

27:07.160 --> 27:07.960
So?

27:13.640 --> 27:14.400
What?

27:32.920 --> 27:33.680
What's going on, love?

27:36.840 --> 27:38.680
That's all I wanna know.

27:38.800 --> 27:39.600
You're not in any trouble.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.480
I promise.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.400
Really?

27:42.520 --> 27:43.320
Really.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.240
I like the feel of them.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.600
Of the-- the ladies clothes?

27:50.720 --> 27:51.520
Yeah.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.880
So you like to wear them?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.120
No way.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.440
That would be weird.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.240
Right, yeah.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.920
OK.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.320
My mum had this cardi.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.240
It was blue and fluffy.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.120
And when she hugged me--

28:22.160 --> 28:25.240
You miss your mum.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.720
Of course you do.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.400
But no more nicking thingsoff washing lines, OK?

28:34.520 --> 28:36.240
People, they might
get the wrong idea.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.120
OK.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.360
The thing that
gets me is, the cops

28:51.480 --> 28:53.960
know who it is, and he's settingright there in your house.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.520
Sparky has nothing
to do with it.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.520
That's not what Ngaire says.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.160
Well, she's wrong.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.880
That couldn't wouldn't
say boo to a mouse.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.520
Yeah, it's the quiet
ones you've gotta watch.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.960
You're all beating the
wrong dog, all right?

29:05.080 --> 29:07.040
Heads up.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.320
Oi, I want a word with you.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.440
What are you doing about thisdegenerate roaming the streets?

29:13.560 --> 29:15.400
We're investigating
the matter.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.920
"Investigating"?
So bugger all, then.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.280
No, not "bugger
all," actually.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.400
And what are you doing about it?

29:19.520 --> 29:21.000
Me?
What can I do?

29:21.120 --> 29:22.600
Well, you can detachyourself from this leaner

29:22.720 --> 29:24.520
and help me, for starters.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.080
All of you could, if youfeel so strongly about it.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.640
You mean, help the cops?

29:28.760 --> 29:30.320
This is more of a
citizen's initiative.

29:30.440 --> 29:31.840
Neighbors looking
after neighbors.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.840
What happened to copslooking out for neighbors?

29:33.960 --> 29:36.200
The fucking two is
what happened, Ted.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.720
Every bastard's too busy toworry about some poxy flasher

29:38.840 --> 29:39.760
in Henderson.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.360
I never said he
would flash too.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.560
It's a figure of
speech, Phineas.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.240
So how are we meant
to help the cops?

29:45.360 --> 29:47.560
Well, as far as I can make outfrom putting all the instances

29:47.680 --> 29:49.400
together, two things stand out.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.640
It's hanging around
Swan Arch Park.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.560
I think we knew
that already, Mike.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.720
And he likes Tuesday nights.

29:56.840 --> 29:57.880
What's so good about Tuesdays?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.360
Think it through, boys.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.920
Benny Tuesday.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.280
Top marks, Bert.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.400
You should be a cop.

30:04.520 --> 30:05.840
The guy gets his benefit.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.120
He gets loaded.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.840
He gets to thinking
about pretty girls.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.640
He gets out, and he gets busy.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.520
What night is it tonight, lefty?

30:13.640 --> 30:15.080
Tuesday.

30:15.200 --> 30:19.960
Are you proposing some typeof vigilante action, Mike?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.160
Bunch of locals go out fora late night stroll and they

30:22.280 --> 30:23.480
happen upon something untoward?

30:26.240 --> 30:28.360
Side entrance, Swan Arch Park.

30:28.480 --> 30:29.520
6:00 PM.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.920
Unless you got this
quaint old boy's

30:31.040 --> 30:33.400
club thing about never
helping out the pigs.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.800
He actually asked
you to help him?

30:39.920 --> 30:44.160
Yeah, it was lucky
he actually cares.

30:44.280 --> 30:47.600
Or he's realized that therest of them are bloody useless.

30:47.720 --> 30:57.240
I suppose we could, just thisonce, put aside our principles

30:57.360 --> 30:58.120
for the greater good.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.400
Yeah, if it does
clear Sparky's name.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.000
So we're here.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.760
We're gonna disperse groupsall around the perimeter,

31:10.880 --> 31:11.640
cover the whole park.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.760
Why are they here?

31:13.880 --> 31:16.240
Well, they live
here, don't they?

31:16.360 --> 31:17.200
Who's that lot.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.200
The neighborhood watch.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.000
They don't look like theycould bloody catch a cold.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.640
Geez, you almost looklike an upstanding citizen.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.760
You almost look
like someone who

31:27.880 --> 31:29.240
knows his ass from his elbow.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.160
I know you.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.520
Brian.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.760
You shot throughbefore I could thank you.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.240
G'day, mate.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.240
Look, it's the guy thatbrought you home a few weeks

31:35.360 --> 31:36.360
back, when your car broke down.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.520
I'm Brian.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.840
You've met Wendy?

31:38.960 --> 31:39.720
Yeah.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.120
Yeah, Lefty.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.640
- Cat-handed, are you?
- Eh?

31:43.760 --> 31:44.560
Well, lefty?

31:44.680 --> 31:45.760
Gibble-fisted?

31:45.880 --> 31:48.120
He's got one
testicle, the left one.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.640
Oh.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.000
Fascinating.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.760
I helped out
Wendy a while back.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.960
Car trouble.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.960
Flat battery.
Gave her a lift home.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.280
Yes, thank you again for that.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.360
You're like the AA,
aren't you, Lefty?

32:01.480 --> 32:03.520
Always there for a
damsel in distress.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.520
Something like that, Rita.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.120
So what's the plan
with this thing?

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
I don't have
time for this shit.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.160
Not now.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
OK, everyone listen up.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.800
The plan is very simple.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.120
You have your peers.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.640
You walk around the
section of the park

32:14.760 --> 32:16.160
you've been designated.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.840
We watch, we listen, and wetry to keep a low profile,

32:19.960 --> 32:21.200
so we don't scare our boy off.

32:21.320 --> 32:24.160
If anyone hears
anything, yell out.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.000
Someone will come running.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.240
Any questions?

32:30.840 --> 32:32.280
We haven't been paired up.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.440
I think you can
figure it out, Bert.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.040
Ted, why don't you come with me?

32:36.160 --> 32:37.320
We can talk.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.080
You can come with me.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.400
I haven't got a partner.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.280
Oh, Brian, are you
sure that's a good idea?

32:42.400 --> 32:43.400
BRIAN: Why not?

32:43.520 --> 32:44.680
Lefty's got his--
his own friends.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.320
- No, we're good.
- I'm going with Mike.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.240
We're good.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.320
Great.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.240
Good.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.320
Let's go.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.840
What about us?

32:52.960 --> 32:54.800
Well, I think this
is blokes only tonight,

32:54.920 --> 32:56.200
Rita, just to be
on the safe side.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.440
Safe side for who?

32:57.560 --> 32:58.880
Exactly.

32:59.000 --> 32:59.760
Let's go.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.120
Good luck!

33:04.240 --> 33:05.160
I need a drink.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.360
You guys go home.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.400
I'll-- I'll see you there.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.920
Wendy?

33:10.040 --> 33:10.800
Wendy.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.560
I need your advice.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.440
Mine?

33:16.560 --> 33:17.720
Yeah.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.680
It's about one of the
boys I look after,

33:19.800 --> 33:22.120
the one who's not quite
right in the head.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.880
You know the one I mean?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.040
There's something
you need to see.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.200
Where?

33:28.320 --> 33:29.520
Where this
nonsense all started.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.640
In the park.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.640
But are you sure that's safe?

33:32.760 --> 33:34.520
Because it's gonna be dark soon.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.920
Oh, it's crawling
with our husbands.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.280
It'll be fine.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.560
I just really need someonefrom the neighborhood watch,

33:41.680 --> 33:42.880
you know?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.480
Someone who really knows
what they're doing?

33:45.600 --> 33:46.920
Thanks, Wendy.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.600
Come on.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.880
He might not have.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.520
Carol, I know
the signs, and it

33:52.640 --> 33:54.120
truly doesn't matter anymore.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.840
But I'm sure Lefty stillloves you, in his own way.

33:57.960 --> 33:58.720
I'm sure he does.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.440
Can I help you?

34:10.120 --> 34:14.200
I know you think it
was me, but it wasn't.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.720
I'd never do
something like that,

34:21.840 --> 34:24.480
especially not to someone--

34:24.600 --> 34:25.360
Someone what?

34:29.360 --> 34:32.840
To someone as
amazing as Chelsea.

34:32.960 --> 34:33.760
Aw.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.440
You know it wasn't
Sparky, right?

34:38.560 --> 34:40.080
How can you be so sure?

34:40.200 --> 34:43.480
Because my wife says so.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.600
Kid's been through
a lot of trauma.

34:45.720 --> 34:47.640
Unexplained death of hisfather and all that, that kind

34:47.760 --> 34:48.920
of stuff makes people weird.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.240
I don't know anything
about that, Mike.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.200
Yup, I got that.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.480
We should probably not talk.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.680
It might scare the guy off.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.840
Are you sure this
was a good idea?

34:56.960 --> 34:57.760
Not far now.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.240
My boys might not look
like the Brady Bunch,

35:03.360 --> 35:04.880
but they're good kids.

35:05.000 --> 35:05.800
What?

35:05.920 --> 35:06.880
They're just boys.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.560
They need a home and need a mum.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.400
I think you should be
more open-minded, Wendy,

35:12.520 --> 35:15.400
rather than just assumingthat we're all criminals.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.400
Aren't you?

35:16.520 --> 35:17.520
That's what the police think.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.680
The police have
been wrong before.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.240
Just ask Arthur Alan Thomas.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.480
How about this?

35:26.600 --> 35:29.440
You drop this thing you'vegot against my family--

35:29.560 --> 35:33.200
and they are my family--

35:33.320 --> 35:35.200
and I'll be open-minded too.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.800
What do you mean?

35:36.920 --> 35:38.000
I mean that I won't tellyou husband you've been having

35:38.120 --> 35:40.520
it off with Lefty Munroe.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.760
I-- I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.320
Yes, you do.

35:46.440 --> 35:49.760
So what I want is for youto point your neighborhood

35:49.880 --> 35:52.600
watch elsewhere.

35:52.720 --> 35:55.040
And I won't point
the finger at you.

35:55.160 --> 35:56.880
How does that sound?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.280
Why did you come
here to show me?

35:58.400 --> 35:59.720
The error of
your ways, mainly.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.920
Holy shit?
What is that?

36:04.040 --> 36:05.120
What?
Where?

36:13.680 --> 36:16.080
[slurping]

36:26.160 --> 36:27.160
She's a good woman, my Wendy.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.880
I couldn't want
for a better wife.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.200
Ngaire tell you about
Wendy's knickers?

36:46.440 --> 36:48.000
Eh?

36:48.120 --> 36:50.840
The bastard stole Wendy's goodlingerie from the clothesline.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.360
Mind you, it's nothingcompared to what you're going

36:57.480 --> 36:59.320
through with your daughter.

36:59.440 --> 37:02.760
I suppose you wannabreak the bastard's neck.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.640
Oh, he'll be sorry if
I get my hands on him.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.080
You can bet on it.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.160
You can leave that to me.

37:10.280 --> 37:13.000
Seen Bruce Lee?
"Fists of Fury"?

37:16.920 --> 37:19.920
I'm extremely
proficient in kung-fu.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.360
[slurping]

37:25.480 --> 37:27.760
Jesus Christ, I'mfreezing my nuts off here.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.520
Woman in Sydney, was it?

37:29.640 --> 37:31.560
Bet his lady kept them all.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.720
Oh, must be a pretty specialbird if you're gonna go all

37:33.840 --> 37:36.800
the way to Aussie to see her.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.760
You know the
flaw in this plan?

37:38.880 --> 37:42.840
We're all assuming thepervert's out every Tuesday.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.640
But what if this Tuesday
the pervert decided

37:44.760 --> 37:46.680
to stay home and watch TV.

37:46.800 --> 37:47.880
What's on TV tonight?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.280
"The Incredible Hulk."

37:49.400 --> 37:50.800
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.880
Plus, all the women arestaying home, because they're

37:53.000 --> 37:54.920
too scared to walk in the dark.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.880
So there's actually no onefor the pervert to attack.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.240
Well, we could put a dresson you, see if he attacks you.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.520
[laughter]

38:06.040 --> 38:07.360
No, it's definitely
not Sparky.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.080
He's way too gorm--

38:09.200 --> 38:11.000
Shh.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.400
Did you hear that?

38:14.520 --> 38:15.640
Let's get the bastard.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.880
If he's got his cock
out, you tackle him.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.840
Gotcha!

38:22.960 --> 38:25.000
What the fuck?

38:25.120 --> 38:26.680
Oh, hey, Ted.I thought you were the pervert.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.640
We thought you were the--

38:27.760 --> 38:28.640
what the hell are you doing?

38:28.760 --> 38:30.320
Taking a slash.

38:30.440 --> 38:31.240
The whole neighborhood's out,looking for a guy with his dick

38:31.360 --> 38:32.160
out, and what are you doing?

38:32.280 --> 38:33.800
I really needed to go.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.120
Then I heard you whispering.

38:35.240 --> 38:36.520
I thought it was the
guy talking to himself,

38:36.640 --> 38:37.960
like crazy people do.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.040
Aw, fuck off, Bert.

38:40.160 --> 38:40.920
OK.

38:44.680 --> 38:45.480
Crap.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.680
So what do you do
at these classes?

38:49.800 --> 38:51.200
Learn self defense.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.080
Like Bruce Lee styles?

38:56.560 --> 38:59.680
Eye, throat, balls!

38:59.800 --> 39:00.560
Brutal.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.560
Sparky, don't be weird.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.440
Sorry.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.400
[screaming]

39:55.160 --> 39:56.120
All right, we got the bastard.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.960
Boys, boys, boys,
enough, enough!

40:01.080 --> 40:02.320
The secret isn't to
leave too many marks.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.200
Wendy!

40:13.520 --> 40:16.040
Bloody hell, Hamish!

40:16.160 --> 40:17.240
What, you know this guy?

40:17.360 --> 40:19.960
He lives over the back fence.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.080
Neighborhood watch, eh?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.760
Bloody dad's army of policing.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.400
Come on, sunshine.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.440
Bastard!

40:26.560 --> 40:27.360
All right, enough.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.720
So are we done being cops now?

40:33.840 --> 40:36.320
Yeah, most certainly are.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.200
Ladies, case closed.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.360
Bad man arrested.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.080
We are the champions,
my friends.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.600
So it wasn't Sparky, then?

40:46.720 --> 40:47.480
Who the hell said it was?

40:58.880 --> 41:00.520
Jesus Christ.

41:00.640 --> 41:01.880
I hope you don't mind.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.160
Wendy, Brian.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.120
We let ourselves in.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.560
Ranch slider doors,
you gotta watch 'em.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.200
They're very easy to break into.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.800
Which we didn't, by the way.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.440
That fake rock you
keep your spare key in?

41:13.560 --> 41:15.160
It's like a beacon.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.600
Any burglar who knows
what he or she is doing

41:17.720 --> 41:19.760
will go straight
for the fake rock.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.520
Or under the pot plant.

41:21.640 --> 41:22.760
Yeah, that's a
classic, that one.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.480
RITA: Ted's a
locksmith, by the way.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.920
He has his own business.

41:26.040 --> 41:29.720
We just wanted to let youknow, as good neighbors,

41:29.840 --> 41:32.360
that your security
needs attention.

41:32.480 --> 41:36.560
Because as you can see, ifyou had anything worth taking,

41:36.680 --> 41:38.320
we would have taken it.

41:38.440 --> 41:39.920
So give us a bell some time.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.520
I'll help you out with yourlatches and locks and so on.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.040
OK?

41:44.160 --> 41:46.040
OK.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.840
Thanks for that, Ted.

41:47.960 --> 41:48.800
Appreciate it.

41:48.920 --> 41:49.680
Not a problem at all.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.800
Eye, throat, balls!

42:15.920 --> 42:17.280
[groaning]

42:17.400 --> 42:18.360
Sparky?

42:18.480 --> 42:19.280
Oh.

42:22.200 --> 42:26.840
I-- I was wondering if you--

42:26.960 --> 42:31.720
if you wanted someone
to walk home with you.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.480
Really?

42:33.600 --> 42:34.680
That'd be great.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.560
OK.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.200
[MUSIC - SPLIT ENZ,
"HOW CAN I RESIST HER?"]

42:39.320 --> 42:46.360
Blonde hair and blue eyes,she came on like a white lie.

42:46.480 --> 42:52.360
My wicked angel in
mortal disguise.

42:52.480 --> 42:57.760
There's one in every crowdgonna make me shout aloud.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.760
How can I resist her?

43:03.880 --> 43:05.280
Haven't even kissed her.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.400
How can I resist her?
