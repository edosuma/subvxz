WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:03.871
ALL RIGHT,
HERE ON FEBRUARY 6th,

00:03.904 --> 00:06.006
WE CELEBRATE
THE BIRTHDAY OF AMERICA'S

00:06.040 --> 00:08.342
GREATEST FOOTBALL PLAYER,
RONALD REAGAN.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.078
RONALD REAGAN?

00:10.111 --> 00:12.180
I THOUGHT HE ONLY PLAYED
FOOTBALL IN THE MOVIES.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.714
(imitating Ronald Reagan)
WELL, THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.483
(laughs)

00:15.516 --> 00:16.884
(normal voice) HE PLAYED
CENTER FOR EUREKA COLLEGE.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.386
THOSE DAYS,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

00:18.419 --> 00:19.720
THEY PLAYED
WITHOUT HELMETS.
(Vanessa) HMM.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.156
OH. THAT EXPLAINS
TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.524
(speaks inaudibly)

00:23.557 --> 00:26.360
MY FACE IS ALL STINGY.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.529
ALL RIGHT.
CAN WE PLEASE JUST
DO THIS, OKAY?

00:28.562 --> 00:29.563
'CAUSE YOU PUT UP
THE STUPID POLE WEEKS AGO,

00:29.597 --> 00:31.365
AND SO FAR IT'S JUST BEEN
A MAGNET

00:31.399 --> 00:32.700
FOR EVERY MORON
WITH A TONGUE.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.735
OH... THAT'S WEIRD.
(shivers)

00:34.768 --> 00:37.171
USUALLY YOU'RE THE MAGNET
FOR EVERY MORON WITH A TONGUE.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.706
(Vanessa) HEY.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.374
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH OF THIS.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.676
BOYD, HOW ABOUT THE PLEDGE
OF ALLEGIANCE? READY?

00:42.710 --> 00:46.013
UH, ACTUALLY, BOYD HASN'T
LEARNED THE PLEDGE.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.882
WHAT?
WHAT? WHY? DON'T THEY SAY IT
EVERY MORNING IN SCHOOL?

00:48.916 --> 00:50.384
HEY, HONEY...

00:50.418 --> 00:52.186
DOES HE HAVE SOME
RETENTION PROBLEMS?

00:52.220 --> 00:53.354
(sighs)
'CAUSE WE COULD GET HIM
TESTED.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.555
NO.
YEAH?

00:54.588 --> 00:56.090
HE'S FINE.
I PROMISE, OKAY?

00:56.124 --> 00:58.426
H-HIS DAD WROTE A NOTE
EXCUSING HIM FROM PARTICIPATING.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.428
(inhales) RYAN OBJECTS
TO THE WORDS "GOD"...

01:00.461 --> 01:03.297
(exhales) "FLAG," AND PRETTY
MUCH ALL THE OTHER WORDS.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.732
WELL, IT TAKES A CERTAIN
KIND OF JACKASS

01:04.765 --> 01:07.368
TO BE OFFENDED BY
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE.
(sighs)

01:07.401 --> 01:09.403
HONEY, WILL YOU GO INSIDE?

01:09.437 --> 01:11.372
GOOD IDEA. (shrieks)
I WAS TALKING TO BOYD.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.640
UH... WELL, COME ON,
COME ON.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.375
GRANDMA'S GONNA MAKE YOU
A HOT BOWL OF OATMEAL.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.378
(sighs)
CAN WE COME BACK WHEN GRANDPA
STOPS BEING MAD AT DADDY?

01:17.411 --> 01:21.882
OH, THAT'S SWEET. (chuckles)
HE THINKS HE'S GONNA STOP.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.418
WHY DO YOU LET RYAN
CALL THE SHOTS WITH BOYD?

01:24.452 --> 01:25.886
SOMETIMES PARENTS
HAVE TO COMPROMISE.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.321
I-I GAVE IN TO RYAN
ON THE PLEDGE,

01:27.355 --> 01:31.459
AND IN RETURN, BOYD DOESN'T HAVE
TO USE UNBLEACHED TOILET PAPER.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.394
(leash rattles)
HEY, LARABEE.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.329
(dog panting)
THERE'S JUST CERTAIN THINGS,
LIKE TOILET PAPER

01:35.363 --> 01:38.031
AND PRESIDENTS,
SHOULD BE WHITE, RIGHT?

01:40.268 --> 01:41.835
THERE WERE WHITE PRESIDENTS?

01:41.869 --> 01:44.071
IT'S BEEN SO LONG,
IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.840
(laughing) HELLO, LADIES.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.309
HEY.
HEY.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.943
UH, FINALLY GOT A FLAG
FOR THAT POLE, HUH, BAXTER?

01:49.977 --> 01:51.745
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE JUST
THE MAN I WAS LOOKING FOR.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.015
A 6'3" BLACK MAN IN THE SNOW
SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO FIND.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.785
I MEANT AN EX-MARINE.
AND YOU'RE NOT 6'3".

01:57.818 --> 01:59.520
WELL, I PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE
IN GULF ONE.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.855
I CAN BE AS TALL AS I WANT.
LISTEN.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.357
(shivering)
WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE YOUR KID

02:03.391 --> 02:04.758
SAY PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
TO THE FLAG,

02:04.792 --> 02:06.260
YOU DISRESPECT EVERYTHING
A SOLDIER LIKE THIS DOES,

02:06.294 --> 02:07.428
EVEN THOUGH HE LIES
ABOUT HIS HEIGHT.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.698
I MEANT NO DISRESPECT,
MR. LARABEE.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.167
A-AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
OUT OF ALL THE GULF WARS,

02:13.201 --> 02:14.502
GULF ONE WAS MY FAVORITE.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.304
HMM.
DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO HER.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.172
THESE KIDS, THEY HAVE
A PROBLEM BEING PATRIOTIC.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.340
KIDS ARE IDIOTS.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.442
I KNOW, 'CAUSE I'M
ON THE INSIDE. (chuckles)

02:21.475 --> 02:23.344
(chuckles)

02:23.377 --> 02:26.113
SO, WOW, YOU WERE A MARINE,
MR. LARABEE?
MM-HMM.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.517
DID YOU CARRY AN M16A2?
THOSE BABIES HAVE SOME RANGE.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.786
I LIKE THE A1--
IN THE FIELD AND ON MY SIRLOIN.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.524
(laughs)
THE MARINES LIKE THAT JOKE.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.359
WHICH IS WHY THE ARMY'S
THE GO-TO BRANCH

02:38.392 --> 02:39.960
FOR COMEDY, MY FRIEND.
ALL RIGHT.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.496
SEMPER FI. (chuckles)
HEY.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.898
YOU KNOW, YOUR POLE'S
TOO SMALL, BY THE WAY.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.167
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

02:47.201 --> 02:48.736
FOR THAT FLAG.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.471
YOU SHOULD CHECK
THE FLAG CODE.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.839
YOU REALLY NEED
A BIGGER POLE.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.442
LIKE MINE. IT'S 30 FEET.

02:56.377 --> 03:00.648
LOT OF PEOPLE
LIE ABOUT THAT, TOO!

03:00.681 --> 03:03.684
-- Captions by VITA --

03:08.456 --> 03:09.823
(whispering) BOYD!

03:09.857 --> 03:12.526
HEY, DAD!
SHH! NOT SO LOUD, BUDDY!

03:12.560 --> 03:14.262
HEY, DO ME A FAVOR.
GRAB YOUR STUFF,

03:14.295 --> 03:16.230
SAY GOOD-BYE, AND MEET ME
OUT FRONT, OKAY?

03:16.264 --> 03:18.198
WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S TRYING
TO AVOID ME,

03:18.232 --> 03:19.933
AND LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE,
HE'S REALLY BAD AT IT.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.503
(normal voice) THAT'S WHY.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.105
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST THE KID
SAYING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE?

03:25.138 --> 03:27.107
IT'S INDOCTRINATION, MAN.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.411
IT'S A PLEDGE.
OF ALLEGIANCE.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.945
TO THE FLAG.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.714
YOU MIGHT WANT TO WRITE
THIS DOWN.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.182
OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.384
MIKE, STOP. STOP IT.
AND TO THE REPUBLIC--

03:36.417 --> 03:38.085
BOYD, WILL YOU DO DADDY A FAVOR
AND GO IN THE OTHER ROOM?

03:38.118 --> 03:41.422
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'LL BE IN THE OTHER ROOM.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.360
(sighs) MIKE, I AM TRYING TO
RAISE BOYD TO THINK FOR HIMSELF.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.596
I DON'T LIKE THE SCHOOL
FORCING HIM TO SAY SOMETHING.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.264
BUT YOU'RE FORCING HIM
NOT TO SAY SOMETHING.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.566
ISN'T THAT INDOCTRINATION,
MAN?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.402
YOU KNOW, WHAT I'M WONDERING IS,
WHEN ALL THESE KIDS

03:54.435 --> 03:56.036
ARE SAYING THE PLEDGE
OF ALLEGIANCE,

03:56.069 --> 03:57.771
IS BOYD JUST STANDING THERE
WITH HIS FINGERS IN HIS EARS

03:57.805 --> 03:59.740
HUMMING "OLD MacDONALD"?

03:59.773 --> 04:01.742
NO. HE AND SEBASTIAN
WAIT OUT IN THE HALLWAY

04:01.775 --> 04:03.110
UNTIL EVERYONE'S DONE.
OH.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.545
SEE, SEBASTIAN'S
A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS

04:04.578 --> 04:07.080
AND OBJECTS
ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS.
(Vanessa) AHH.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.249
HOW DOES SEBASTIAN KNOW
WHEN TO GO BACK INTO THE CLASS?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.751
HE JUST WAITS FOR A REAL
INCONVENIENT TIME

04:10.784 --> 04:12.786
TO RING THE DOORBELL
A HUNDRED TIMES?

04:15.188 --> 04:17.224
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WOULD LOVE TO STAY,

04:17.257 --> 04:20.127
BUT, UH...
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.462
BOYD, COME ON, BUDDY.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.131
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST
THE FLAG, ANYWAY?

04:24.164 --> 04:26.133
BECAUSE TO MOST OF THE WORLD,
THAT FLAG HAS COME TO STAND

04:26.166 --> 04:27.601
FOR WAR AND CONQUEST.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.170
RIGHT. LIKE THAT TIME
WHEN NEIL ARMSTRONG

04:30.203 --> 04:32.172
PLANTED THAT FLAG
RIGHT AFTER SLAUGHTERING

04:32.205 --> 04:34.908
ALL THOSE MOON PEOPLE.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.144
MIKE, IF THE FLAG STOOD
FOR ANYTHING ELSE,

04:37.177 --> 04:39.480
YOU'D FLY IT EVERY DAY,
AND NOT JUST THOSE DAYS

04:39.513 --> 04:41.482
THAT SALUTE OUR MILITARY
AND ITS LEADERS.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.684
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A POINT THERE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.453
I'M GONNA START FLYING THAT FLAG
EVERY DAY.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.688
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA TEACH
THAT KID SOME PATRIOTISM,

04:47.721 --> 04:49.122
GRANDPA'S GONNA.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.959
HEY, DAD.
HEY, EVE.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.128
WHAT'S UP, BOYD?
THEY'RE FIGHTING AGAIN.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.997
WE ARE NOT FIGHTING, SON.
WE'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.999
NO, WE'RE FIGHTING, AND I'M
WINNING. THAT'S WHAT THE--

04:59.032 --> 05:01.168
UH, BOYD, HONEY...
I KNOW, I KNOW.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.971
GO UPSTAIRS
AND GET MY BACKPACK.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.206
HI, SWEETIE.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
HI.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.309
UM, CAN YOU SIGN THIS?
I'M TRANSFERRING OUT OF ART.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.979
EVERY LITTLE MISTAKE I MAKE,
MR. FAHEY'S ALL UP IN MY FACE.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.447
MM.
HE'S LIKE A DRILL SERGEANT.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.484
YEAH.
SO I'M SWITCHING
TO JUNIOR ROTC.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.286
ROTC? REALLY?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.555
PLAYING AT WAR IS YOUR IDEA
OF HIGH SCHOOL FUN?

05:21.589 --> 05:23.323
WELL, WE KNOW WHAT YOUR IDEA
OF HIGH SCHOOL FUN WAS--

05:23.357 --> 05:25.359
IT JUST RAN UPSTAIRS
TO GET A BACKPACK.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.160
(mouths word)

05:27.194 --> 05:29.697
WELL, DAD, I WAS--
I WAS THINKING ABOUT

05:29.730 --> 05:31.965
WHAT YOU AND MR. LARABEE SAID
ABOUT HONORING THE FLAG, AND...

05:31.999 --> 05:34.334
YEAH.
I'M NOT ASHAMED TO BE
A PATRIOT.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.170
YEAH, YEAH.
THIS IS THE FACE OF SOMEONE

05:37.204 --> 05:38.672
WHO LOVES HER COUNTRY,
RIGHT HERE.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.207
AND WE GET TO SHOOT RIFLES

05:40.240 --> 05:43.877
AND WEAR UNIFORMS THAT REALLY
FREAK OUT THE STONERS.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.923
JUNIOR ROTC.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.925
MIKE, I DON'T WANT HER
TO END UP IN THE ARMY.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.894
BABY, SHE'S 14.
AND LEGEND HAS IT

06:00.928 --> 06:04.898
THAT 14-YEAR-OLDS CHANGE
THEIR MINDS NOW AND THEN.

06:04.932 --> 06:07.701
DRILL MARCHES,
FIELD EXERCISES...
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.102
GUN TRAINING--I HATE IT.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.538
LISTEN, WE BOTH AGREED

06:10.571 --> 06:11.839
THAT WHATEVER THE GIRLS
WANT TO DO,

06:11.872 --> 06:13.541
WE'RE GONNA SUPPORT
THEM IN THEIR PATH, CORRECT?

06:13.574 --> 06:15.509
YEAH, WHY DO YOU ONLY
REMEMBER WHAT I SAY

06:15.543 --> 06:18.345
WHEN IT BENEFITS YOU?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.081
YOUR QUESTION HAD
THE ANSWER BUILT RIGHT IN.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.051
SHE'S NOT GONNA
JOIN THE ARMY.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.353
AND IF SHE DID, SHE'D HAVE
THE SKILLS.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.121
THANKS TO ME, SHE CAN
SHOOT AND SURVIVE.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.190
AND THANKS TO YOU,
SHE CAN TOLERATE BLAND FOOD.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.559
OH, HA HA HA.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.526
(knock on door)

06:32.560 --> 06:34.127
YEAH?
COME IN.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.729
HEY.
HEY.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.865
SO, UH, DAD, I WAS JUST
READING THIS FLAG CODE,

06:37.898 --> 06:40.534
AND IT SAYS IDEALLY
YOU SHOULD RAISE IT AT SUNRISE.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.736
WELL, I'LL BE OUT THERE
WITH YOU.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.440
GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE.
GOOD NIGHT. LOVE YOU.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.442
(sighs) DO YOU REALIZE...
(sighs)

06:48.476 --> 06:50.878
YOU JUST PROMISED
TO GET UP EVERY DAY

06:50.911 --> 06:54.715
BEFORE SUNRISE
TO RAISE THAT FLAG?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.116
YEAH.
(chuckles)

06:56.149 --> 06:57.585
WELL, I'M NOT LIKE
SOME PEOPLE

06:57.618 --> 07:00.420
WHO'VE MADE PROMISES
IN THIS BED THEY HAVEN'T KEPT.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.589
(clicks switch)

07:01.622 --> 07:02.823
WHAT?!

07:02.856 --> 07:04.157
GOOD NIGHT.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.594
(alarm ringing)

07:06.627 --> 07:09.730
("Stars and Stripes Forever"
playing)

07:09.763 --> 07:12.666
(ropes whooshing)

07:12.700 --> 07:15.569
(whooshing)

07:15.603 --> 07:18.438
(whooshing continues)

07:18.472 --> 07:21.008

07:40.661 --> 07:44.464
***

07:47.668 --> 07:50.504
(speaks inaudibly)

07:55.042 --> 07:58.145
***

07:59.547 --> 08:01.715
(revs)

08:01.749 --> 08:04.317
(chain saw roaring)

08:07.354 --> 08:10.290
(alarm ringing)

08:10.323 --> 08:11.892
(turns off alarm, clattering)
(groans)

08:11.925 --> 08:15.996
(muttering and groans)
(sighs)

08:16.029 --> 08:19.166
(drowsily) HAVE FUN
WITH YOUR FLAG, DEAR.
YEAH.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.135
(groans) YEAH.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.137
HEY, GRANDPA!
HEY. SLOW DOWN.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.505
DON'T SLIP, DON'T SLIP,
DON'T SLIP, DON'T SLIP.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.541
(clicks tongue) WELL,
THERE'S OLD GLORY AGAIN.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.843
YEAH, YOU CAN JUST
CALL ME MIKE.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.346
LOOK. EVERY TIME BOYD
LOOKS OUT HIS WINDOW,

08:33.380 --> 08:35.583
WHAT'S HE SEE? THE BEAUTIFUL
STARS AND STRIPES.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.350
YEAH, 'CAUSE, UH, WHO WANTS
TO LOOK OUT

08:37.384 --> 08:39.352
AND SEE THE SUNRISE
AND NATURE?

08:39.386 --> 08:40.654
HE'LL GET PLENTY OF TIME
TO SEE NATURE

08:40.688 --> 08:42.189
WHEN I TEACH HIM HOW TO HUNT.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.724
WE'LL STRAP SOME NATURE
TO THE FRONT OF MY TRUCK

08:43.757 --> 08:45.525
AND DRIVE IT
RIGHT TO YOUR HOUSE.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.496
HEY, BAXTER, HOW'S YOUR CUTE
LITTLE POLE?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.699
HEY, LARABEE, IT'S NOT
THE SIZE OF YOUR POLE.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.334
IT'S HOW YOU FLY YOUR FLAG.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.903
HEY, COME ON OVER.
I WANT YOU TO MEET

08:55.936 --> 08:58.338
MY GRANDSON'S DAD.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.407
HEY! SO YOU'RE
THE BABY DADDY.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.175
(chuckles)
(exhales)

09:02.209 --> 09:04.612
RYAN VOGELSON.
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, SIR.
HEY.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.547
SO, DAD WHO WON'T LET HIS SON
SAY THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE,

09:07.581 --> 09:10.050
WHY DON'T YOU MEET A BIG
EX-MARINE? HAVE AT HIM.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.254
I ADMIRE THAT YOU
STAND UP FOR YOUR PRINCIPLES.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.756
NO, YOU DON'T.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.258
I DO!
I-I FOUGHT FOR AMERICA.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.527
AND TO ME, THOSE STARS
DON'T JUST REPRESENT 50 STATES.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.262
THEY REPRESENT
DIFFERENT BELIEFS,

09:22.295 --> 09:23.530
AND I FOUGHT FOR THEM ALL.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.366
YOU SEE, MIKE? I AM JUST
AS MUCH A PATRIOT AS YOU ARE.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.969
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.705
I ADMIRE
THAT YOU TAKE A STAND,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.907
BUT UNTIL YOU SIT
IN THE BACK OF A BRADLEY

09:33.941 --> 09:37.544
AND BRACE FOR AN INCOMING RPG,
YOU RESPECT THAT FLAG.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.814
BOOM!

09:40.848 --> 09:43.550
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU, SIR.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.788
THERE'S SOME BURN CREAM
IN THE GIRLS' BATHROOM.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.623
WOW, I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THAT.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.791
BOY, I'LL TELL YOU,
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!

09:50.824 --> 09:53.126
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!
(laughs)

09:53.160 --> 09:55.629
WELL, I ADMIT, I DID
KIND OF ENJOY THAT.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.830
(laughs)

09:56.864 --> 10:00.600
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FLY THIS EVERY DAY...

10:00.634 --> 10:03.771
UNLESS YOUR HOUSE
IS A POST OFFICE.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.106
WELL, IT IS KIND OF LIKE
A POST OFFICE.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.741
I GOT, YOU KNOW,
MORE WOMEN THAN BATHROOMS,

10:07.775 --> 10:09.943
SO A LOT OF TIMES
YOU WAIT IN LINE TO,

10:09.977 --> 10:11.444
YOU KNOW, DROP STUFF OFF.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.647
(laughs)

10:13.681 --> 10:15.282
I JUST DO THIS
TO TEACH THE KIDS

10:15.315 --> 10:16.750
A LITTLE ABOUT PATRIOTISM.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.586
GETTING UP AT SUNRISE,
BRINGING HER DOWN AT SUNSET.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.421
AND WHEN IT RAINS.
WHAT?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.190
THIS IS NOT AN ALL-WEATHER
FLAG YOU GOT HERE,

10:23.223 --> 10:25.325
AND I GOT A LITTLE PIECE
OF SHRAPNEL IN MY LEG

10:25.358 --> 10:27.627
THAT SAYS STORM'S A-COMIN'.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.532
Y-YOU REALLY ENJOY THIS,
DON'T YOU?
(laughs) YEAH.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.634
ALMOST AS MUCH AS WHEN THAT
FELLA IN MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD

10:34.668 --> 10:36.436
PUT UP THAT CONFEDERATE FLAG.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.906
RAINED A LITTLE BIT
ON THAT ONE MYSELF.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.044
(gunfire on videogame)
OH, MY GOD!

10:44.077 --> 10:45.946
I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER
PLAYED THIS BEFORE! AHH!

10:45.979 --> 10:48.348
WOW. WAR IS SO MUCH FUN.
(gunfire continues)

10:48.381 --> 10:50.217
BOOM! I AM KILLING
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.319
SERIOUSLY, LOOK.
(clicking)

10:52.352 --> 10:53.887
(laughs)
I'M KILLING EVERYTHING.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.522
YOUR GUY GOT HIS HEAD
BLOWN OFF

10:55.555 --> 10:57.557
THE SECOND WE STARTED
PLAYING.

10:57.590 --> 11:01.328
OH, MAN, THAT WAS ME?
TSK. WHEN DO I GET ANOTHER GUY?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.963
RIGHT NOW. GO.
OH! YEAH!

11:02.996 --> 11:04.698
(gunfire continues)
(squeals)

11:04.732 --> 11:07.367
AND YOU'RE DEAD AGAIN.
OHH!

11:07.400 --> 11:10.637
OOH! AH, LOOK AT MY LITTLE
GIRLS PLAYING TOGETHER.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.640
WADING THROUGH HUMAN ENTRAILS.
(explosions)

11:13.673 --> 11:16.509
HEY, MOM, CHECK IT OUT.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.346
LOOK AT MY NEW
ROTC UNIFORM.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.849
WOW, IT LOOKS LIKE
A REAL SOLDIER'S UNIFORM.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.483
I KNOW. ISN'T IT AWESOME?
(giggles)

11:23.516 --> 11:27.187
YEAH, IF IT WERE 1989 AND YOU
WERE JANET JACKSON. (laughs)

11:27.220 --> 11:28.521
(mouths word)

11:28.555 --> 11:31.058
BURN! (laughs)

11:31.091 --> 11:33.160
SO, UH, THIS IS
MY DRESS UNIFORM,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.528
AND I'LL BE IN CAMO WHEN I'M
IN COUNTRY AS A SNIPER.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.665
YEAH, I DECIDED
I WANTED TO BE A SNIPER.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.533
OH. WELL, THAT'S WORDS

11:40.567 --> 11:43.236
EVERY LITTLE GIRL'S MOTHER
LONGS TO HEAR.
YEAH.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.505
BUT NOT JUST ANY SNIPER, MOM.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.108
I'M GONNA BE THE FIRST FEMALE
SNIPER IN THE MARINE CORPS.
OHH.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.543
YOU ALWAYS TOLD ME TO DO
WHAT I LOVE, RIGHT?
UH... I KNOW, HONEY,

11:50.577 --> 11:52.445
BUT THAT WAS WHEN
YOU WANTED TO BE A MERMAID.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.714
YOU KNOW, IT'S... (sighs)

11:54.748 --> 11:57.851
SOMETHING REALISTIC.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.687
MOM, I GET IT.
YOU'RE WORRIED.
YEAH.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.223
BUT IT'S--IT'S A LONG WAY
OFF, AND WHO KNOWS?

12:03.256 --> 12:05.625
I MIGHT CHANGE MY MIND
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.427
(clicks tongue) ALL RIGHT.
THANKS.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.362
THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER,
HONEY. THANKS.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.798
YEAH.
(gunfire resumes)

12:10.831 --> 12:12.699
I MIGHT EVEN WANT TO BE
A S.E.A.L.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.567
THAT'S PRACTICALLY
A MERMAID.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.970
(sighs)

12:22.242 --> 12:23.076
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.078
EVE WANTS TO BE A JARHEAD?
YEAH.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.047
A MARINE SNIPER?
YEAH.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.581
AND THE WAY VANESSA'S
REACTING, YOU'D THINK

12:28.615 --> 12:31.418
THE KID WAS IN KANDAHAR TAKING
SHOTS AT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.920
YEAH? (chuckles)

12:32.953 --> 12:34.955
WELL, I'M WITH VANESSA
ON THIS ONE.
WHY?

12:34.988 --> 12:36.824
I DON'T THINK WOMEN SHOULD BE
SOLDIERS, PRIESTS,

12:36.857 --> 12:39.893
OR PETER PAN.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.463
COME ON, CATHY RIGBY,
UH, MARY MARTIN--

12:43.496 --> 12:45.265
THE NAME'S PETER,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

12:45.298 --> 12:46.766
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS

12:46.800 --> 12:48.768
WANTS TO HAVE A CAREER
IN THE MILITARY,

12:48.802 --> 12:51.138
I'M NOT OKAY WITH PEOPLE
TELLING HER THAT SHE CAN'T.
AH...

12:51.171 --> 12:53.306
(cell phone rings)
HOLD ON A SECOND. JUST A MINUTE.
SPEAKING OF THE DEVIL.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.842
HEY, EVE, WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.643
OH, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GO TAKE IT DOWN.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.111
OKAY.
I GOTTA LEAVE EARLY
IN A MINUTE.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.479
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:59.512 --> 13:00.814
OH, SHE'S REALLY INTO
THIS MILITARY STUFF.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.515
IT'S RAINING.
I GOTTA TAKE THE FLAG DOWN.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.818
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS IN NAM,
I COULDN'T IMAGINE

13:04.852 --> 13:06.253
FIGHTING ALONGSIDE A LADY.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.255
I MEAN, YOU WIN WARS
WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND, MIKE.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.723
BOOTS, NOT HIGH HEELS.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.329
(door closes)

13:16.363 --> 13:18.131
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

13:18.165 --> 13:19.699
I CAME HOME
BECAUSE IT WAS RAINING.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.301
I WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE THE FLAG
DOWN, BUT IT'S NOT THERE.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.669
SOMEBODY STEAL IT?

13:22.702 --> 13:24.604
(chuckles) NO, EVE ALREADY
TOOK IT DOWN.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.840
(Vanessa typing)
OH. OH. OH, OH. GOOD.

13:26.874 --> 13:27.975
MM.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.977
UH... DAD?

13:30.010 --> 13:32.779
OKAY, I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT IT WAS RAINING,

13:32.812 --> 13:34.982
AND THE FLAG SLIPPED
OUT OF MY HAND

13:35.015 --> 13:36.483
AND LANDED IN THE MUD.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.684
IT'S OKAY TO WASH THIS.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.519
YOU KNOW, THOSE COLORS
DON'T RUN FROM ANYTHING.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.689
EXCEPT BLEACH.
OHH.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.225
OHH. WELL...

13:45.258 --> 13:47.660
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE LOST
TWO STATES.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.933
LET'S JUST HOPE IT'S NEW YORK
AND CALIFORNIA, HUH?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.170
I'M REALLY SORRY, DAD,

13:57.204 --> 13:59.206
BUT ACCORDING TO THE FLAG CODE,
IT HAS TO BE DESTROYED.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.309
OH.
OH. HONEY, DON'T WORRY.
WE CAN GET ANOTHER ONE.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.710
NO, NO. WHY?
THERE'S NO REASON.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.679
IT'S--IT'S--THIS IS
IMPORTANT TO ME EMOTIONALLY,

14:06.713 --> 14:08.181
'CAUSE IT FLEW OVER
THE WHITE HOUSE.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.816
IT'S ONE OF THOSE...
UH, REAGAN FLAGS.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.720
YOU KNOW, LIKE REAGAN,
IT'S IRREPLACEABLE.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.688
I SAW THREE ON eBay.
DID YOU NOW?

14:15.722 --> 14:16.924
YEAH.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.692
I HAVE TO... PROCESS THIS,
THIS LOSS.
MM.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.061
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE
TOO SOON

14:21.094 --> 14:24.731
TO GET ANOTHER FLAG
ON eBay.
OKAY.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.700
WELL, WE SHOULD TAKE IT TO
THE V.F.W. FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.536
ED'S A VETERAN.
HE'LL TAKE US THERE.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.737
I'LL GO PUT ON MY UNIFORM.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.339
OOH-RAH!
HEH HEH.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.075
ADMIT IT, A PART OF YOU
IS REALLY HAPPY

14:35.108 --> 14:36.676
THIS FLAG GOT MESSED UP

14:36.709 --> 14:38.078
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH IT ANYMORE.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.712
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.614
YEAH? WELL, YOUR BIRTHDAY'S
COMING UP!

14:41.648 --> 14:43.150
I DON'T WANT A FLAG.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.456
(indistinct conversations)

14:49.489 --> 14:52.125
(Ed) WELCOME. HERE YOU GO.
HUH?

14:52.159 --> 14:53.893
WHOA!
HERE YOU ARE.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.528
COOL.
HEY.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.097
SO ALL THESE GUYS
HAVE SEEN ACTION?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.432
YEAH, YEAH, EVERYBODY
BUT RIGLEY.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.102
HE STILL LIVES
WITH HIS MOM.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.038
I'M PRETTY SURE SHE MEANT
COMBAT ACTION.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.474
AHH.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.578
HEY. YOU KNOW WHAT
THESE THINGS ARE?

15:11.611 --> 15:14.481
YEAH.
THAT'S A STEALTH BOMBER.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.583
AND THAT'S THE "NAUTILUS."
MM.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.750
THE FIRST NUCLEAR-POWERED
SUBMARINE.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.553
HMM. WHO'S THAT?
GENERAL PATTON?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.489
NO, THAT'S, UH,
GENERAL BOB HOPE.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.125
YES. I SAW HIS U.S.O.
SHOW IN NAM.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.627
HE BOMBED MORE THAN L.B.J.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.829
BUT THAT ANN-MARGRET...
(snarls)

15:29.862 --> 15:31.664
SHE REMINDED US
WHAT WE WERE FIGHTING FOR.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.566
(laughs) YEAH.
HEY, ED.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.934
HEY, STEVENS, HOW ARE YOU?
(laughs)
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

15:34.968 --> 15:36.636
MY FRIEND MIKE BAXTER.
HEY.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.770
MIKE, HOW DO YOU DO?
PLEASURE.
IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU.

15:37.804 --> 15:38.905
HIS DAUGHTER EVE.
HI, EVE. HOW ARE YOU?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.773
HI.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.275
IT'S AN HONOR
TO MEET YOU, SIR.
HONOR TO MEET YOU, MA'AM.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.444
HEY, MIKE, ED TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR FLAG.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.079
OH, A LITTLE ACCIDENT
AT HOME,

15:46.113 --> 15:48.515
AND WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
IT'S DISPOSED OF PROPERLY.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.817
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
THERE MIGHT BE

15:50.850 --> 15:52.585
SOMETHING WE CAN DO
TO REPAIR THIS.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.254
NO, THERE'S NO REASON
TO REPAIR IT. YOU REALLY--

15:54.287 --> 15:55.655
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.424
I JUST WANT TO DO IT
THE RIGHT WAY, LET IT GO.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.992
COME ON. LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW TO DO IT.
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.660
OKAY.
COME WITH ME. COME WITH ME.
BELLY UP, KIDDO. (laughs)

16:00.693 --> 16:01.861
(sighs)
HERE WE GO.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.464
BARKEEP, TWO BEERS--
ONE REGULAR, ONE ROOT.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.466
MR. ALZATE,
I GOT YOUR ROOT BEER.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.468
THANK YOU.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.637
HI. I'M EVE BAXTER.
(exhales)

16:10.670 --> 16:12.639
(chuckles) AND I'M ED ALZATE.
HOW ARE YOU?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.641
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HELLO, EVE BAXTER.
HELLO, ED.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.843
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M JEAN.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.346
SO, JUNIOR ROTC, HUH?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.481
YEAH. THAT'S HOW I GOT
MY START.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.849
WERE YOU IN THE WAR?

16:22.882 --> 16:25.285
SURE, BUT MOSTLY I'M HERE
TO MEET GUYS.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.820
(Ed clears throat)
(indistinct conversations)

16:27.854 --> 16:29.889
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD
MISS IRAQ.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.659
(Ed chuckles)

16:32.692 --> 16:35.162
WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO THERE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.730
I WAS AN ARMORY GUNNER
ON A CONVOY.

16:37.764 --> 16:38.865
WOW.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.833
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A SAW IS?

16:40.867 --> 16:42.569
SQUAD AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.671
BELT-FED, GAS-OPERATED
MACHINE GUN.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.640
(breathes sharply) YEAH,
IT'S MY WEAPON OF CHOICE

16:47.674 --> 16:48.975
IN "CALL OF DUTY."

16:49.008 --> 16:51.010
(chuckles)

16:51.044 --> 16:55.215
WELL, IT WAS MY WEAPON OF CHOICE
PROTECTING MY CONVOYS.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.517
YOU WERE A POINT GUNNER
ON A CONVOY?

16:57.550 --> 17:00.420
YEAH. 41 TRIPS BACK AND FORTH
TO THE GREEN ZONE,

17:00.453 --> 17:02.555
AND EVERYONE CAME HOME SAFE.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.557
WHEW.
MUST HAVE BEEN INTENSE.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.727
NOT NEARLY AS INTENSE

17:07.760 --> 17:09.529
AS TRIP 42.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.075
HEY.
HEY.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.047
WHOA.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.284
(door opens)

17:31.318 --> 17:32.785
(Vanessa) HI!

17:32.819 --> 17:35.088
HEY.
YOU HUNGRY? GOT SOME
PIZZA IN THE KITCHEN.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.556
OKAY.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.191
(breathes sharply)
HOW DID IT GO?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.627
OH... WELL, WE GOT RID
OF THE FLAG PROPERLY.

17:40.660 --> 17:44.131
MET A LOT OF VETERANS.
COUPLE GUYS FROM WORLD WAR II.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.066
AND THEN WE GOT THIS
RAMBLING VIETNAM VETERAN.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.470
BUT YOU KNOW ED.
WOULDN'T SHUT UP.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.140
AND THEN A ARMORY GUNNER
FROM IRAQ, A WOMAN.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.874
SHE LOST BOTH HER LEGS.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.110
OH, THANK GOD.
HONEY.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.146
UH, NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
SORRY. UH...

17:59.179 --> 18:00.980
NO, BUT THAT--THAT
CAME OUT WRONG.
YEAH.

18:01.013 --> 18:04.217
NO, I WAS HOPING THAT EVE
WOULD MEET SOME REAL VETS

18:04.251 --> 18:07.920
AND IT WOULD PUT HER OFF
OF THIS WHOLE SNIPER BUSINESS.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.789
SHE WAS PRETTY QUIET
IN THE CAR ON THE WAY HOME.
YEAH.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.258
EVE, HONEY?

18:11.291 --> 18:12.625
YEP?
COME HERE.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.461
(exhales)
YOU OKAY?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.062
YEAH.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.231
THE V.F.W. WAS INTENSE.
YEAH.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.833
THIS MARINE STUFF
ISN'T JUST SOME VIDEOGAME.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.802
WHAT I SAW TODAY WAS REAL.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.937
MAYBE WE CAN GET YOU BACK
INTO THAT ART CLASS, HUH?

18:24.971 --> 18:26.573
FORGET THAT.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.475
MEETING THAT GUNNER TODAY
WAS REALLY INSPIRING,

18:28.508 --> 18:31.678
SO, DAD, CAN YOU TAKE ME
TARGET SHOOTING THIS WEEKEND?

18:31.711 --> 18:35.448
AND, MOM, I'M GONNA NEED
SOME HEAD-SIZED MELONS.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.118
GRANDPA!

18:39.152 --> 18:40.620
DAD.
HEY, BUDDY.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.822
(chuckles)
HOW YOU DOING?

18:42.855 --> 18:45.425
SORRY ABOUT YOUR FLAG,
GRANDPA.
WELL, THANK YOU.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.160
BOYD FELT BAD ABOUT YOU
HAVING TO DESTROY IT,

18:47.194 --> 18:49.028
SO HE HAD AN IDEA. RIGHT?

18:49.061 --> 18:51.331
RIGHT.
YOU READY?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.765
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE
TO THE FLAG

18:52.799 --> 18:55.001
OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA,

18:55.034 --> 18:57.036
AND TO THE REPUBLIC
FOR WHICH IT STANDS,

18:57.069 --> 18:59.472
ONE NATION, UNDER GOD,

18:59.506 --> 19:01.508
THE WORD THAT'S HARD TO SAY...

19:01.541 --> 19:02.642
(Mike laughs)

19:02.675 --> 19:05.178
WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE
FOR ALL.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.049
THERE YOU GO.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.884
(Boyd and Mike laughing)

19:11.918 --> 19:13.820
HOW WAS THAT, GRANDPA?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.855
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.
(Vanessa) MM.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.056
AW. HOW COME IT'S PERFECT
FOR HIM,

19:17.089 --> 19:19.259
BUT WHEN I FORGET THE WORDS,
YOU'RE ALL OVER ME?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.629
(Mike laughing)
BOYD, THAT WAS GREAT!

19:22.662 --> 19:25.632
NOW YOU CAN SAY WITH THE REST
OF YOUR CLASS AT SCHOOL, HUH?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.066
NO, I DON'T WANT TO.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.035
NO, IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE. YOUR DAD
SAID HE WAS FINE WITH IT.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.637
BUT IF I STAY
IN THE CLASSROOM,

19:30.670 --> 19:33.240
SEBASTIAN WILL HAVE TO STAY
OUT IN THE HALL BY HIMSELF.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.807
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE HIM
FEEL BAD.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.810
AW. AW, HONEY! YOU ARE
THE GREATEST! (grunts)
(chuckling)

19:37.844 --> 19:39.512
NO MAN LEFT BEHIND.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.314
HE'S GONNA BE
A FUTURE MARINE LIKE ME.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.716
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.252
EVERYBODY,
PIZZA IN THE KITCHEN.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.686
GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT.
YEAH!

19:46.719 --> 19:48.655
LET'S GO.
HEY, EVE.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.490
SIT DOWN. I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.658
(groans)

19:51.691 --> 19:53.726
THIS ISN'T THE SEX TALK,
IS IT?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.429
'CAUSE BETWEEN KRISTIN,
MANDY, AND THE INTERNET,

19:56.463 --> 20:00.300
I ALREADY KNOW MORE
THAN I'D LIKE TO.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.506
NO. NO.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.740
LISTEN.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.242
IF YOU DID WANT TO BECOME

20:09.276 --> 20:10.610
THE FIRST FEMALE
MARINE CORPS SNIPER,

20:10.643 --> 20:12.712
YOUR MOM AND I WOULD BE
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.247
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN, DAD.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.948
BUT IF YOU ALSO DECIDE
TO BE A DOCTOR

20:15.982 --> 20:18.785
OR A-A NON-UNION TEACHER...

20:20.887 --> 20:24.757
OR, WHAT THE HECK,
EVEN A UNION SCHOOLTEACHER,

20:24.791 --> 20:27.560
WE'D STILL BE VERY,
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.562
THANKS.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.264
BUT I'M A BAXTER.
YEAH.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.065
WE KICK ASS AND TAKE NAMES.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.468
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHO
KICKS ASS AND TAKES NAMES?

20:35.502 --> 20:38.505
YOU KNOW, ARIEL THE MERMAID.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.611
SHE'S, UH, TOUGHER
THAN SHE LOOKS.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.416
(knock on door)

20:49.449 --> 20:51.250
HEY, LARABEE, COME ON IN.
HEY, BAXTER.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.485
HOW YOU DOING?
HEY.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.787
HEY. NOW, HEY, I HEARD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FLAG,

20:54.821 --> 20:58.425
AND I FELT BAD, SO I--
I GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.728
HEY, DON'T WORRY.
IT'S NOT ANOTHER FLAG.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.130
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD, 'CAUSE I
COULD HAVE USED ONE, YOU KNOW?
YEAH.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.598
THIS IS TOO--

21:05.632 --> 21:08.134
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

21:08.167 --> 21:10.470
IT IS ANOTHER FLAG!

21:10.503 --> 21:12.439
HEH HEH.
HEH.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.407
IT'S--YES, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S REALLY NICE.
UH...

21:14.441 --> 21:15.675
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.444
WELL, THANKS, MR. LARABEE!
(Mike) YEAH.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.412
AND, EVE, THIS IS FOR YOU.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.414
(exhales) THANKS.
YEAH.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.149
WHAT'S THE FUN
OF GETTING UP AT DAWN

21:23.182 --> 21:24.517
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
YOUR VERY OWN...

21:24.551 --> 21:26.953
BUGLE!
OHH!

21:26.986 --> 21:29.589
(bugle playing out of tune)
