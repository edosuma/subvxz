WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Garibaldi.

00:14.083 --> 00:16.583
Garibaldi, I got your message.
Okay, fine.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.167
So another pointless meeting.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.667
- Here I am.
- Why don't you take off?

00:19.750 --> 00:22.083
I'll, uh, call you
if I find out anything, alright?

00:23.250 --> 00:24.708
Three weeks, Garibaldi,
three weeks

00:24.792 --> 00:26.583
since I asked you
to help find my daughter.

00:26.667 --> 00:29.000
I haven't been able to eat,
I haven't been able to sleep

00:29.083 --> 00:31.083
since we were separated during
the raid on the Aris colony.

00:31.167 --> 00:32.625
And all I get from you
is silence.

00:32.708 --> 00:34.750
Except when you want
more money, more information.

00:34.833 --> 00:37.250
The same old questions
over and over.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.250
Look, Ben--

00:38.333 --> 00:39.458
She was the whole reason
I fought

00:39.542 --> 00:40.958
to stay alive during the raid.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.958
She means everything to me.
Don't you understand?

00:44.042 --> 00:46.625
Without her, I have
nothing to live for.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.583
- Ben?
- What?

00:50.458 --> 00:52.167
Turn around.

00:56.208 --> 00:58.500
Alison. Oh, God.

00:59.875 --> 01:03.250
Oh, I thought
I'd never see you again.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.292
Are you alright, baby?

01:05.375 --> 01:06.792
She inhaled some morph gas
during the raid.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.625
Her lungs haven't healed yet,
but the doc thinks

01:08.708 --> 01:10.542
she'll be okay
in about a week or so.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.458
Why didn't you tell me?

01:12.542 --> 01:15.000
Because then I wouldn't have
been able to see this.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.125
Kinda makes the job
worth doing.

01:17.208 --> 01:21.333
Which reminds me, I've got
your bill here somewhere.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.083
There was nowhere else to go.

01:25.167 --> 01:26.958
It took most of all
of what we had

01:27.042 --> 01:28.875
and I'd give everything
just to have..

01:29.750 --> 01:32.000
Here you go.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.833
Uh, Mr. Garibaldi,
there seems to be an error.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.250
What are you talking about?

01:35.333 --> 01:37.000
I've never overcharged
anybody in my life.

01:37.083 --> 01:40.333
No, no, not the bill.
It's one-third your fee.

01:40.417 --> 01:41.792
It is?

01:41.875 --> 01:43.542
Yeah, it is.

01:43.625 --> 01:46.000
Well, I am gonna have to take
this up with bookkeeping.

01:46.083 --> 01:48.583
I mean, this hardly even
covers my expenses, I..

01:48.667 --> 01:51.417
Well, now that I think about it,
I am the bookkeeping department.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.958
I'll tell you what.

01:53.042 --> 01:54.958
I don't wanna get me into
trouble over this, so, uh..

01:56.750 --> 01:58.667
...why don't we just
let it go with 30%?

01:58.750 --> 02:00.667
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:00.750 --> 02:04.333
Just don't tell anyone.
It's bad for my business.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.792
I'm sorry
for what I said earlier.

02:06.875 --> 02:09.375
I was wrong about you,
Garibaldi.

02:09.458 --> 02:12.042
Oh, that's alright.
I'm, I'm used to it.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.458
- Bye.
- See you. Thanks.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.667
[sighs]

02:39.875 --> 02:41.583
He's there.

02:41.667 --> 02:43.542
Why don't we wait till
it gets a little quieter?

02:43.625 --> 02:46.208
Then we'll have a little talk
with Mr. Garibaldi.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.625
It's about time that
he got his first assignment.

02:49.708 --> 02:53.500
It'll give us a chance to find
out how sincere he really is.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.542
You're gonna tell him
what he's getting into?

02:57.167 --> 03:00.667
Let's see how he handles
himself in a crunch.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.083
If he comes through,
we'll know that, uh

03:03.167 --> 03:05.083
we can move him up.

03:05.167 --> 03:07.417
If he gets killed, we'll know
we got the wrong guy.

03:08.542 --> 03:11.625
At this point,
Mr. Garibaldi is eminently..

03:12.833 --> 03:13.875
...expendable.

03:20.958 --> 03:23.125
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.958
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

03:25.042 --> 03:27.917
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.625
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:29.708 --> 03:32.000
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.542
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

03:33.625 --> 03:35.208
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

03:35.292 --> 03:37.208
(Londo)
It was a new age.

03:37.292 --> 03:39.125
(Stephen)
It was the end of history.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.458
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.958
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

03:47.042 --> 03:50.042
(Sheridan)
The place, Babylon 5.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.167
[theme music]

04:41.958 --> 04:45.042
[music continues]

04:56.917 --> 04:58.750
Captain, you wanted to see..

05:03.000 --> 05:05.292
- Captain?
- 'I'm here.'

05:07.917 --> 05:09.792
(Zack)
'You okay, captain?'

05:11.458 --> 05:13.167
I'm fine.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.208
I've been doing a great deal
of thinking, Zack.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.667
There are several hundred
unpleasant things

05:19.750 --> 05:22.792
I've been avoiding doing
since I got back from Z'ha'dum.

05:22.875 --> 05:25.458
Now with Delenn gone,
I don't have any excuses.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.458
I have to start
taking care of them.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.083
I checked Mr. Garibaldi's file.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.500
When he resigned
as chief of security

05:34.583 --> 05:37.083
regulations required
that he turn in his link

05:37.167 --> 05:39.542
his Identicard and his weapon.

05:39.625 --> 05:42.375
This has not been done. Why?

05:42.458 --> 05:45.125
Well, he's going to come back
sooner or later, captain--

05:45.208 --> 05:46.708
Maybe he will, maybe he won't.

05:46.792 --> 05:49.708
At the moment,
he's not on the payroll.

05:49.792 --> 05:52.542
Well, I just don't think
he's going to take it very well.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.250
That's all, captain.

05:54.333 --> 05:55.958
He knows the regs
as well as we do.

05:56.042 --> 05:57.958
He'll understand.

05:58.042 --> 06:02.833
Captain, look, I know the chief
better than almost anybody.

06:02.917 --> 06:05.542
When you work with somebody
24 hours a day for three years

06:05.625 --> 06:07.417
you pick up a few things.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.750
When he got back

06:08.833 --> 06:10.750
he couldn't wait
to get back on the job.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.708
Now the way he walked away..

06:14.333 --> 06:16.292
...it just doesn't
make any sense.

06:18.875 --> 06:21.417
If you're gonna wait for the
universe to start making sense

06:21.500 --> 06:24.042
you'll have a long wait
ahead of you.

06:24.125 --> 06:27.458
Meanwhile, I want this
taken care of. Today.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.208
Yes, sir.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.583
Captain, can I ask..

06:40.292 --> 06:41.917
...why the rush?

06:47.625 --> 06:49.542
I don't like the company
he's been keeping.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.500
[whistles]

07:04.583 --> 07:06.667
I like what you've done
with the place, Susan.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.333
Stephen, welcome to the voice
of the resistance.

07:08.417 --> 07:09.667
- Yeah.
- When did you get back?

07:09.750 --> 07:12.333
- Oh, about an hour ago.
- And how was Mars?

07:12.417 --> 07:14.167
It was cold, dirty, crowded

07:14.250 --> 07:16.708
but at least we've got
the resistance on board.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.333
I mean, I don't know
how long we can keep them

07:18.417 --> 07:21.125
but, uh, for now, they're
willing to work with us.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.667
Marcus went off to brief
the captain

07:22.750 --> 07:24.000
and I heard what you were up to

07:24.083 --> 07:26.167
so I thought I'd come
and check it out.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.500
How's it going?

07:27.583 --> 07:29.083
Well, the recorders
are all hooked up.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.833
We've adjusted
the StellarCom system

07:30.917 --> 07:32.208
to transmit
on a broadband frequency

07:32.292 --> 07:34.083
rather than point to point.

07:34.167 --> 07:37.000
So technically,
we're ready to go.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.708
Uh, but, uh..

07:38.792 --> 07:40.833
Well, there's just one
little thing we don't have.

07:40.917 --> 07:41.958
Power.

07:42.042 --> 07:44.000
The ISN uses
Tachyon relay stations

07:44.083 --> 07:46.208
to boost the signal
through hyperspace.

07:46.292 --> 07:48.333
Without that, the signals
would take years

07:48.417 --> 07:49.708
to get from Earth to here.

07:49.792 --> 07:51.125
Well, have you tried patching
into their system?

07:51.208 --> 07:52.917
Yeah, we tried it.
It didn't work.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.708
We can transfer the signal
throughout most of this sector

07:54.792 --> 07:56.208
but beyond that..

07:56.292 --> 07:58.042
I mean, if we're gonna broadcast
all the way back to Earth

07:58.125 --> 07:59.208
we're gonna need
a hell of a lot more power

07:59.292 --> 08:00.625
than what we've got now.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.083
And I don't know
where we're gonna get it.

08:02.167 --> 08:03.375
I mean, I've been working
on this for days

08:03.458 --> 08:05.167
and I don't have a clue.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.542
What about Epsilon 3?

08:07.625 --> 08:09.542
Uh, during the war,
we evacuated a lot

08:09.625 --> 08:11.000
of the wounded down there
for safekeeping.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.958
Now I spent a lot of time
looking around.

08:13.042 --> 08:15.125
There's enough power
down there to broadcast

08:15.208 --> 08:16.542
clear to the Rim.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.375
Or just a crazy thought.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.542
We could try Epsilon 3.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.083
Yeah, you could do that, yeah.

08:22.167 --> 08:23.500
I mean, it's the logical choice.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.000
Anybody could see that
in about two seconds.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.917
I mean, only a complete fool
would fail to see that.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.875
- Well, I wouldn't, uh--
- It's absolutely obvious.

08:29.958 --> 08:31.167
Well, I wouldn't have thought
of it, that's for sure.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.917
No, you're far
too modest, Stephen.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.292
No, no, no, that's why you get
paid the big bucks, after all.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.083
Yep, that's my job.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.542
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I think there's a shuttle

08:39.625 --> 08:40.667
with my name on it
waiting for me.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.375
Just feel free. Look around.

08:42.458 --> 08:43.750
I'll be back.

08:45.875 --> 08:46.917
Hah.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.083
You know, I like her.

08:50.167 --> 08:52.583
Scares the hell out of me
sometimes, but I do like her.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.417
Just, uh,
don't tell her that, okay?

09:06.917 --> 09:09.292
- Hi, chief.
- Hey, Zack.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.750
How's it going?

09:11.833 --> 09:15.542
So far, today has been
a great day.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.625
[chuckles]
You know, it reminds me

09:17.708 --> 09:20.208
of why I went independent
in the first place.

09:20.292 --> 09:22.125
You know, up in the war room,
it's all just

09:22.208 --> 09:23.542
well, pieces on the board.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.000
Fleets, empires,
all the big stuff.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.833
You never get to see the faces
of the people you help.

09:27.917 --> 09:30.583
It's, it's just not personal.

09:30.667 --> 09:33.875
You never get to look into
their eyes and understand that

09:33.958 --> 09:36.500
you know, maybe you made their
life just a little bit better.

09:36.583 --> 09:39.292
So how's it going?
It's going great.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.500
- How about with you?
- Well, not so good.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.625
The captain sent me
to talk to you.

09:45.708 --> 09:47.125
Ah, yes.

09:47.208 --> 09:50.167
And what does his transcendence
want from me now?

09:50.250 --> 09:51.625
Your link

09:51.708 --> 09:53.542
your Identicard and, uh..

09:54.750 --> 09:56.625
...your weapon.

09:56.708 --> 09:58.667
[chuckles]
Hey, come on, it's okay.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.583
I got a new civilian ID anyway,
a long time ago.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.083
Now the link, I never liked the
damn thing from the beginning.

10:04.167 --> 10:06.250
You know, it's supposed to use
that molecular bonding thing.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.500
But every time I took it off

10:07.583 --> 10:09.250
it pulled the hairs
off the back of my hand.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.250
See? They don't
grow back anymore.

10:13.875 --> 10:18.125
Now, the gun, uh,
I'm gonna keep that, Zack.

10:18.208 --> 10:21.250
- I can't allow that.
- Come on, Zack, this is me.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.917
I'm running a private
investigation company.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.708
I can't go
walking around unprotected.

10:24.792 --> 10:28.375
Your PPG
is military issue, chief.

10:28.458 --> 10:29.875
Now you still got
your private license.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.833
You can pick up another gun
from somebody else.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.125
He can't argue with that.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.708
But he wants the gun
you were issued

10:34.792 --> 10:36.875
when you came aboard.

10:51.042 --> 10:52.833
And the, uh, backup.

11:02.042 --> 11:05.125
- Anything else?
- No, that'll do it.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.500
Look, chief, I'm sorry.
It's the regs.

11:08.583 --> 11:11.000
- What was I supposed to do?
- Say no.

11:11.083 --> 11:12.833
He just would've sent
somebody else.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.750
Yeah, that's right.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.875
But at least it wouldn't
have come from you.

11:16.958 --> 11:19.167
I could live with that
a lot better.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.833
[sighs]

11:29.958 --> 11:32.125
(male #1)
'Shuttle one,
you are cleared to leave.'

11:32.208 --> 11:33.625
(Ivanova)
'Roger that.'

11:50.375 --> 11:53.000
[on TV]
Oh, time to hit the old silk.

11:53.083 --> 11:57.083
Geronimo-o-o!

12:16.500 --> 12:18.542
Alright, enough is enough.

12:18.625 --> 12:22.542
(Daffy)
'This is the final,
the-the very, very last straw.'

12:22.625 --> 12:25.417
Who is responsible
for this, this..

12:25.500 --> 12:27.625
I demand that you show yourself.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.708
Who are you, huh?

12:34.292 --> 12:36.292
Ain't I a stinker?

12:36.375 --> 12:37.792
(Garibaldi)
Pause.

12:37.875 --> 12:40.083
- Who is it?
- 'Wade.'

12:42.167 --> 12:43.208
Open.

12:47.792 --> 12:50.500
Your timing sucks.
I was just about to have dinner.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.292
- What's up?
- Got a job for you.

12:53.375 --> 12:54.917
Yeah, well, business hours
are nine to six.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.333
- You know where to find me.
- 'This is a special job.'

12:57.417 --> 12:58.458
I don't think
you'd wanna be holding

12:58.542 --> 13:00.625
this conversation in public.

13:02.208 --> 13:03.750
You said that, uh,
you didn't like the way

13:03.833 --> 13:05.958
things were being handled
around here, Mr. Garibaldi.

13:06.042 --> 13:08.167
You said that you wanted
to help me and my friends.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.458
Now you can.

13:10.542 --> 13:13.292
I wanna hire you as a bodyguard.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.833
And an expediter.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.542
You interested?

13:18.625 --> 13:20.875
Depends on who
you want me to guard

13:20.958 --> 13:23.333
and what you want me
to expedite.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.375
A contact from Earth
who does not want

13:25.458 --> 13:28.208
any official record
of this visit.

13:28.292 --> 13:31.625
My contact is coming to do
important business here.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.417
He may run into problems
with the people

13:33.500 --> 13:35.583
we'll be dealing with.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.583
And security.

13:38.667 --> 13:40.500
So you want me to get
this person past security

13:40.583 --> 13:42.958
no questions asked,
no Identicards, no checks.

13:43.042 --> 13:44.542
'Precisely.'

13:44.625 --> 13:48.917
If anyone knows the vulnerable
places on Babylon 5

13:49.000 --> 13:51.583
that would be you.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.250
Of course, it means going up
against your own security team.

13:56.208 --> 13:58.333
You have a problem with that?

14:03.708 --> 14:05.375
If you'd asked me
that question yesterday

14:05.458 --> 14:07.458
I'd have said yes.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.125
Today, no.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.667
No, I don't have a problem
with that at all.

14:15.083 --> 14:16.625
I'm in.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.250
(male #2)
'Shuttle 1, you're cleared
for atmospheric insertion.'

14:26.333 --> 14:27.833
(Ivanova)
'Roger that, C&amp;C.'

14:58.833 --> 15:01.125
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.792
Hello. Excuse me.

15:03.833 --> 15:05.292
Excuse me. Uh, excuse me.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.875
- I, I need to see Draal.
- Ah, Draal is very busy.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.958
Have had four groundquakes
on other side of planet.

15:12.042 --> 15:15.333
Damaged weather control system
to great machine.

15:15.417 --> 15:18.583
- Zathras.
- Yes?

15:18.667 --> 15:20.667
Wh-what the hell
are you doing here?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.333
Zathras work here.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.958
Zathras was born here.

15:25.042 --> 15:28.167
You work up there,
Zathras work down here.

15:28.250 --> 15:29.875
You dress like that.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.833
- Zathras dress like this.
- That's not--

15:31.917 --> 15:34.625
Just covering all possibilities.

15:34.708 --> 15:38.500
Zathras does not want
you being confused. Bye.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.333
Whoa, whoa, w-wait a minute.
Wait. Wait.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.542
You're not supposed to be here.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.333
We left you a thousand years
in the past.

15:43.417 --> 15:44.458
- No.
- Yes.

15:44.542 --> 15:47.500
We have never met before.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.625
But Zathras very pleased
to be meeting you.

15:50.708 --> 15:53.917
- No, no. We have met.
- No.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.875
Oh. No, no.

15:56.958 --> 15:59.833
[laughs]
No, no, no.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.708
No, no.

16:01.792 --> 16:06.792
No, you did not meet Zathras.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.417
You met Zathras.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.542
- Let's try this again.
- As you wish.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.208
Zathras came with us
to Babylon 4.

16:15.292 --> 16:17.042
Zathras stayed in the past
with Valen.

16:17.125 --> 16:18.583
- You're Zathras.
- Yes.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.042
Therefore, you went
into the past.

16:20.125 --> 16:24.500
No, that was not Zathras.
That was Zathras.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.042
There are ten of us.

16:27.125 --> 16:30.042
All of family Zathras.

16:30.125 --> 16:31.750
Each one named Zathras.

16:31.833 --> 16:36.417
Slight differences
in how you pronounce.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.417
Zathras.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.500
Zathras.

16:43.958 --> 16:45.708
Zathras.

16:45.792 --> 16:47.583
You are seeing now?

16:48.667 --> 16:50.792
- There are ten of you?
- Yes.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.583
Uh, well..

16:53.667 --> 16:56.417
...nine now.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.708
- And Zathras?
- Gone.

16:59.792 --> 17:02.000
Zathras warn Zathras

17:02.083 --> 17:06.750
but Zathras never
listen to Zathras.

17:06.833 --> 17:12.375
Zathras was quiet one in family.

17:12.458 --> 17:16.917
So what can Zathras
be doing for you?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.250
Well, we're, um, trying
to put together a facility

17:19.333 --> 17:21.625
to broadcast messages back home
and to the other colonies.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.708
Now we've got all the pieces
that we need, but--

17:23.792 --> 17:28.125
But not having enough power
to reach far places.

17:28.208 --> 17:29.875
[laughs]

17:29.958 --> 17:32.208
Now yes, Zathras understand.

17:32.292 --> 17:38.083
Oh, everyone always coming
to Zathras with problems.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.083
Great responsibilities.

17:42.167 --> 17:45.125
But Zathras does not mind.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.958
Zathras trained
in crisis management.

17:49.042 --> 17:50.250
That's great. Let's--

17:50.333 --> 17:56.000
But only Zathras have
no one to talk to.

17:56.083 --> 18:00.250
No one manages poor Zathras.

18:00.333 --> 18:04.500
You see,
so Zathras talks to dirt.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.500
Sometimes talks to walls.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.833
Or talks to ceilings.

18:10.917 --> 18:12.667
But dirt is closer.

18:12.750 --> 18:17.958
Dirt is used to everyone
walking on it.

18:18.042 --> 18:20.292
Just like Zathras.

18:20.375 --> 18:24.292
But we have come to like it.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.625
It is our role.

18:27.708 --> 18:32.167
It is our destiny
in the universe.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.333
[laughs]
So you see

18:33.417 --> 18:38.333
sometimes dirt
has insects in it.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.250
And Zathras likes insects.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.333
Not so good for conversation

18:44.417 --> 18:47.250
but much protein for diet.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.917
Hah, mmm.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.333
Ah, very good.
Oh, Zathras fix now.

18:51.417 --> 18:55.042
- Come. This way.
- Nine of them. Oy!

19:03.917 --> 19:05.333
Mr. Garibaldi, I'd remind you

19:05.417 --> 19:07.542
that the docking area
is that way.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.708
Yeah, I know, but sometimes
you gotta take a step back

19:09.792 --> 19:11.833
before you can take one forward.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.458
Come on.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.458
I thought you turned in
your station ID.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.542
I did, but I made a backup
a long time ago

19:21.625 --> 19:23.667
in case I ever got into trouble.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.250
I just never thought
I'd have to use it

19:25.333 --> 19:27.042
to get around my own people.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.208
[beeps]

19:38.750 --> 19:40.917
So what does your contact
look like?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.500
There's been a slight change
in plan.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.417
He couldn't make it.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.292
You know, business, schedule,
that kind of thing.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.083
So he sent his wife
in his place.

19:48.167 --> 19:49.833
He wants her to start
learning the ropes

19:49.917 --> 19:53.250
so that she can take over
in case he's not available.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.667
[indistinct chattering]

20:03.000 --> 20:04.792
Which one is she?

20:07.250 --> 20:08.708
She's that one.

20:16.792 --> 20:17.958
Lise.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.708
I don't understand you, Michael.

20:21.792 --> 20:25.458
We've got a good life here.
We've got history.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.792
You've met this
Sinclair character twice

20:27.875 --> 20:31.000
and now you're off
to Babylon 5, just like that.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.792
Doesn't what we have
mean anything to you?

20:33.875 --> 20:36.042
You think you've got
something to prove

20:36.125 --> 20:38.792
that somehow, maybe
taking this job will mean

20:38.875 --> 20:41.417
the last five years
didn't happen?

20:41.500 --> 20:44.292
But I'm part
of those years, Michael

20:44.375 --> 20:47.292
and I will not go
to Babylon 5 with you.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.917
It's got to be one or the other.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.583
When you make up your mind..

20:52.667 --> 20:54.417
...you know where to find me.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.458
I've made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

20:57.417 --> 20:59.333
You're one of them.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.458
I never should've left you.
I realize that now.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.417
'I've got a couple of weeks
leave coming soon'

21:04.500 --> 21:06.750
and I'm gonna take it on Mars.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.333
I thought maybe we could
work things out if--

21:08.417 --> 21:11.292
Michael, I can't.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.708
- Oh, if it's the job--
- I'm married.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.750
- Oh.
- His name is Franz.

21:20.083 --> 21:22.750
We're expecting our first baby
in September.

21:24.125 --> 21:27.167
Yeah, it's Lise Hampton-Edgars.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.750
You know her?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.333
Yeah.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.042
We were gonna get married,
once upon a time.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.542
So you wanna tell me what
happened or shall I just

21:59.625 --> 22:01.042
make something up
and see if it fits?

22:01.125 --> 22:02.542
I didn't know
you were Bill's contact.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.458
- They didn't tell me.
- Not that part.

22:05.542 --> 22:07.542
Somewhere between the last time
I talked to you and now

22:07.625 --> 22:09.875
you lost one husband
and got another.

22:09.958 --> 22:11.458
Must've been the shortest
separation in history

22:11.542 --> 22:13.708
since I didn't even hear
about it.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.958
I found out
Franz was having an affair.

22:17.417 --> 22:19.958
I was gonna file for divorce,
but he got there first.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.583
And you know the courts
back on Mars.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.042
All the judges
are appointed by Earth.

22:26.125 --> 22:28.083
So they always favor
Earth naturals

22:28.167 --> 22:29.583
over Martian-born.

22:31.125 --> 22:32.708
I got nothing.

22:33.708 --> 22:36.500
He got our baby girl.

22:36.583 --> 22:38.500
I haven't seen her
in over a year.

22:39.667 --> 22:42.708
Last I heard, he remarried

22:42.792 --> 22:45.042
and when Deborah grows up

22:45.125 --> 22:47.208
they're not even gonna
tell her about me.

22:47.292 --> 22:51.000
And you were so distraught
that you forgot where I was.

22:51.083 --> 22:53.167
I didn't forget, Michael!

22:54.417 --> 22:55.667
But I knew you were happy here.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.375
It was the happiest
I'd ever seen you.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.708
I was mixed up.
I was confused.

23:01.917 --> 23:05.625
You finally had
your life together.

23:05.708 --> 23:08.750
What right did I have
to come and mess that up?

23:08.833 --> 23:10.375
What right?

23:12.042 --> 23:15.583
Lise, you were my life.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.167
That was a long time ago.

23:21.917 --> 23:24.042
We're different people now.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.833
Six months ago, I found Bill.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.042
We hit it off.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.250
He's a decent, caring man.

23:39.792 --> 23:41.958
And we got married.

23:42.042 --> 23:44.458
And now it's Lisa Hampton..

23:46.917 --> 23:48.375
...Edgars.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.583
Your husband's name
is, uh, Bill?

23:54.750 --> 23:56.208
Bill Ed..

23:57.750 --> 24:00.708
You don't mean William Edgars?

24:03.292 --> 24:05.417
William Edgars
who owns half of Mars Dome?

24:05.500 --> 24:07.042
William Edgars
who's got more money than God?

24:07.125 --> 24:09.125
'That William Edgars?'

24:09.208 --> 24:11.000
[whistles]
Boy.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.708
[scoffs]
You certainly
did trade up, Lise.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.500
[chuckles]
Wow.

24:15.583 --> 24:18.333
He owns the largest medical
research facility on Mars.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.208
He probably spends
more on chips and dip

24:20.292 --> 24:22.375
than I earned in a year
as chief of security.

24:22.458 --> 24:24.208
The money's got nothing
to do with it.

24:24.292 --> 24:25.458
Oh, absolutely.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.875
Now this is the third time
you've broken my heart

24:28.958 --> 24:32.167
and that's one more
than you're entitled to.

24:32.250 --> 24:34.375
And that's the last thing
I'm ever gonna say about this.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.333
- Michael--
- No, no. End of conversation.

24:36.417 --> 24:39.042
Nour husband hired me to do
a job and I'm gonna do it.

24:39.125 --> 24:42.000
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just one more client.

24:42.083 --> 24:44.375
And after you've gone back
to Mars

24:44.458 --> 24:47.417
I'm gonna make-believe
that none of this ever happened.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.750
And you know what?

24:48.833 --> 24:51.000
I don't need a drink
anymore to do that.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.042
I'm glad, Michael.

24:56.833 --> 24:58.458
- I'm sorry--
- Yeah?

25:01.792 --> 25:02.958
Everything's set.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.417
You two ready?

25:06.500 --> 25:07.917
Couldn't be readier.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.958
Miss Edgars?

25:21.417 --> 25:24.458
[dramatic music]

25:25.500 --> 25:27.250
I have no idea how it was done.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.750
It's quite astonishing
unless you have seen it

25:29.833 --> 25:31.250
with your own eyes.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.625
- Oh.
- Uh, come in, G'Kar.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.458
I need you both in here
for this. Please?

25:43.125 --> 25:45.542
Now look, by now, both of you
have heard of the raids

25:45.625 --> 25:47.542
against commercial transports
along the borders

25:47.625 --> 25:50.042
of the Non-Aligned Worlds?

25:50.125 --> 25:53.708
Now that the war is over,
everyone's resources are low.

25:53.792 --> 25:55.958
Some people tried
to take advantage of that.

25:56.042 --> 25:57.500
Pirates. Raiders.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.625
Smaller worlds that didn't
get involved in the war

25:59.708 --> 26:02.667
now have a chance
to expand their empires.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.833
- The Drakh.
- Drakh?

26:06.208 --> 26:07.875
You've heard of them?

26:07.958 --> 26:10.958
They are a, a legend.

26:11.042 --> 26:12.375
The kind you would use
to frighten

26:12.458 --> 26:14.792
small children at night.

26:14.875 --> 26:19.000
They were ruthless, savage,
but extremely bright.

26:19.083 --> 26:21.792
A very bad combination.

26:21.875 --> 26:23.917
No one has seen them
for centuries.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.958
Well, they're back.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.417
We believe they were at Z'ha'dum
working for the Shadows.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.500
And now with them gone, all
their allies are on the loose

26:31.583 --> 26:33.125
armed with Shadow technology.

26:33.208 --> 26:36.083
- This is most unfortunate.
- Yes, I agree.

26:37.833 --> 26:40.333
After the last Shadow War

26:40.417 --> 26:42.583
the rangers were assigned
to watch the frontier

26:42.667 --> 26:45.875
because the Shadows always
came back sooner or later.

26:45.958 --> 26:48.625
This time
they're not coming back.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.000
But their legacy remains.

26:51.083 --> 26:54.417
So I wanna give the rangers
a new mission.

26:55.833 --> 26:57.417
I want to assign
the White Star fleet

26:57.500 --> 27:00.333
to patrol the borders
along the Non-Aligned Worlds.

27:00.417 --> 27:03.000
They'll watch out
for raiders, Drakh.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.833
Anyone engaged
in hostile activities

27:04.917 --> 27:08.500
against civilian transports
and intervene.

27:08.583 --> 27:12.875
Then they won't be involved in
military campaigns, border wars.

27:12.958 --> 27:14.583
That's not their mandate.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.375
Their job
is to maintain the peace

27:16.458 --> 27:18.333
and protect civilians,
nothing more.

27:18.417 --> 27:21.542
The other races could see this
as an act of aggression.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.375
Putting your ships
on their borders

27:23.458 --> 27:26.250
could easily be interpreted
as a grab for power.

27:26.333 --> 27:29.083
An attempt to form
your own personal empire.

27:29.167 --> 27:31.000
We'll only go
where we're invited

27:31.083 --> 27:33.167
in exchange
for technical support

27:33.250 --> 27:35.292
and the authority
to carry out their mission.

27:35.375 --> 27:39.125
As much as it may astonish
everyone in the room

27:39.208 --> 27:41.542
I agree with G'Kar.

27:41.625 --> 27:44.333
You are playing
a dangerous game, captain.

27:45.750 --> 27:47.917
That's why I called you here.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.292
Everyone knows that
the Narn and Centauri

27:50.375 --> 27:52.458
don't agree on anything.

27:52.542 --> 27:54.417
But if you both will allow
the White Stars

27:54.500 --> 27:56.833
to patrol the borders
between your two empires--

27:56.917 --> 27:58.750
We don't need anyone's help.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.000
We can protect ourselves.

28:01.083 --> 28:03.625
To allow this
would be a sign of weakness.

28:03.708 --> 28:06.375
Or a signal that it's time
to put our differences behind us

28:06.458 --> 28:09.292
and try to build something
for a change.

28:09.375 --> 28:12.417
Look, it's easy to come together
for a common enemy.

28:12.500 --> 28:16.083
Now our job is to come together
for a common goal.

28:16.167 --> 28:19.042
If you agree, it will encourage
the other races to sign on.

28:19.125 --> 28:22.083
If you don't,
more civilians will be killed

28:22.167 --> 28:23.917
while we stand around here
arguing about it.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
- That's not fair.
- No.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.708
No, it isn't.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.917
But it happens to be true.

28:32.875 --> 28:34.083
If we do nothing

28:34.167 --> 28:35.792
their blood will be
on our hands.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.667
Is that what you want?

28:41.833 --> 28:42.958
Is it?

28:53.875 --> 28:57.125
Computer, status report.

28:57.208 --> 29:00.875

'Transferring updated

Is there more
than one security Identicard

[upbeat music]

30:11.333 --> 30:13.417
I don't like meeting
out in the open like this.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.542
This is where he said to meet
him. This is where we meet him.

30:15.625 --> 30:18.000
We should be safe in a public
place like this, shouldn't we?

30:18.083 --> 30:19.958
You've never been
to Downbelow before.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.750
- Miss Edgars?
- Yes?

30:24.250 --> 30:26.250
- Where's your husband?
- He couldn't make it.

30:26.333 --> 30:28.250
- He asked me--
- Do you have it?

30:35.292 --> 30:36.542
Wow.

30:39.833 --> 30:42.125
You got some serious
protection on this thing.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.292
- Who's he?
- It's alright.

30:44.375 --> 30:47.792
It's a molecular isoblock.
It's harder than diamonds.

30:47.875 --> 30:50.250
You can only open it
if you know the molecular code.

30:50.333 --> 30:53.583
- Fancy. What is it?
- It's none of your concern.

30:53.667 --> 30:56.583
It is if this stuff is gonna
be used against anyone.

30:56.667 --> 30:58.375
A package like this

30:58.458 --> 31:00.083
we're talking
some serious contamination

31:00.167 --> 31:01.458
if it gets into the wrong hands.

31:01.542 --> 31:03.167
Am I right?

31:03.250 --> 31:06.042
- My husband is a humanitarian.
- Yeah, right.

31:06.125 --> 31:09.333
His researchers believe
there may be a genetic danger

31:09.417 --> 31:11.042
to some telepaths.

31:11.125 --> 31:13.333
The gene that activates
a telepath may be mutating

31:13.417 --> 31:16.583
into something serious,
like some kind of virus.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.250
This may hold the information
we need to stop it.

31:19.333 --> 31:22.583
Ah, and put, what,
another ten billion credits

31:22.667 --> 31:25.583
into the hands of the great
humanitarian William Edgars?

31:25.667 --> 31:27.375
So why all the cloak and dagger?

31:27.458 --> 31:29.500
Don't wanna start a panic.

31:29.583 --> 31:33.250
The syndrome isn't even
transferable to non-telepaths.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.375
But facts don't get in
the way of a good panic.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.792
And there are a number of people
who want this in their hands.

31:38.875 --> 31:42.583
Some to sell it
and some to destroy it.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.458
They'd like nothing more
than to see every telepath die

31:45.542 --> 31:48.042
on Earth
because they're afraid of them.

31:48.125 --> 31:51.792
We had to use alien researchers
to unlock the genetic code.

31:51.875 --> 31:54.792
'It was too tough
for the boys back home.'

31:54.875 --> 31:57.708
'This stuff is extremely
difficult to produce.'

31:57.792 --> 32:00.208
'What's in that container
is the product of five years''

32:00.292 --> 32:03.125
'hard work and cost
half a million credits.'

32:03.208 --> 32:05.500
'So I had orders to only
give it to Mr. Edgars'

32:05.583 --> 32:08.333
or his representative.
We can't afford--

32:08.417 --> 32:09.917
Yeah, look, uh,
we'd better get out of here.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.917
I don't like some of the looks
we're starting to get.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.750
Hey, I know you.

32:13.833 --> 32:16.375
You were here last night
with Carol.

32:16.458 --> 32:19.458
- I'm sure you're mistaken.
- No, no, no. It was you.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.250
- Look out.
- Hey!

Let's go this way.
Down. Come on.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.375
I thought you were supposed
to be armed.

33:00.458 --> 33:03.000
Yeah, well, I was.
It's a long story.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.792
- Come on.
- Why? What's wrong?

33:07.875 --> 33:09.708
Damn. They canceled
my security clearance.

Alright, get back, get back.

Alright, come on.

Hurry.

33:41.583 --> 33:42.792
Alright.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.125
Go.

33:48.208 --> 33:50.083
Come on, come on.
Keep moving. Go ahead.

33:51.583 --> 33:53.083
- Come on, you next. Come on.
- What about you?

33:53.167 --> 33:55.250
I'll be right behind you.
Go on. Come on, go.

Go on, that way.
Straight, then right.

34:13.167 --> 34:14.833
- Go on. I'll catch up.
- We can't leave you.

34:14.917 --> 34:16.917
- Wade, get her out of here.
- Come on, go on, go. Now.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.125
Oh, hell.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.625
No! Stop! Back away, now!

35:32.708 --> 35:33.917
- But you said--
- I know what I said.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.375
Come on, back up. Hurry.

35:35.458 --> 35:37.750
'Back up. Now. Move.'

35:37.833 --> 35:39.167
'Come on. Hurry.'

35:39.250 --> 35:42.125
'Move! Move! Move! Move!'

35:44.208 --> 35:45.792
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

35:48.583 --> 35:50.208
We should be clear now, huh?

35:50.292 --> 35:52.458
- You alright?
- Yeah.

35:52.542 --> 35:53.958
- You?
- Yeah.

35:54.042 --> 35:56.542
Okay, listen. Listen, we're
gonna be going to Docking Bay 3.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.542
It's abandoned.
Now if we get separated

35:58.625 --> 36:00.542
I just want you to keep
repeating Docking Bay 3.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.500
Docking Bay 3. Just keep
thinking that, alright--

36:02.583 --> 36:04.500
- Why?
- Just do it. Okay?

36:04.583 --> 36:06.875
- Okay.
- Alright, you ready?

36:06.958 --> 36:08.417
Alright, let's go.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.583
Come on, come on,
I got you. I got you.

36:27.875 --> 36:30.292
- This isn't Docking Bay 3.
- Yeah, you're right.

36:30.375 --> 36:32.750
But you were so scared, you were
broadcasting all over the place.

36:32.833 --> 36:34.083
They couldn't help
but pick it up.

36:34.167 --> 36:35.542
Drowned out everything
I was thinking.

36:35.625 --> 36:37.417
- Telepaths.
- Yeah, it's gotta be.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.333
That's the only way they could
have known where we were going.

36:39.417 --> 36:41.083
Hey, hey, hey, Jake,
listen up, listen up.

36:41.167 --> 36:42.750
I want you to find Zack,
I want you to tell him

36:42.833 --> 36:44.250
that the shooters from
Brown sector are in Bay 3.

36:44.333 --> 36:45.417
I'll meet him there, alright?

36:45.500 --> 36:48.000
Go. Alright.

36:48.083 --> 36:49.542
I need you to get her on the
next transport out of here.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.000
- Can you handle it?
- Not without an identicard, no.

36:52.083 --> 36:54.250
Alright, uh, I want you
to see Drake down in Brown 14.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.625
I popped him a couple
of times for fake ID.

36:56.708 --> 36:57.708
You tell him to give you
one or I'm gonna

36:57.792 --> 36:59.042
take it out of his hide.

36:59.125 --> 37:00.583
I got an appointment in Bay 3.

37:00.667 --> 37:02.000
I'm gonna find out
who those guys are

37:02.083 --> 37:03.167
and what they're after.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.458
Alright, come on, go.
Come on.

37:04.542 --> 37:06.375
I can't go like this, Michael.

37:08.375 --> 37:11.458
Look, you gotta go
one way or another.

37:11.542 --> 37:14.083
And I am gonna miss you
one way or another.

37:14.167 --> 37:16.083
So just go on.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.208
I just hope he's taking
good care of you.

37:18.292 --> 37:19.792
Come on, go.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.917
[dramatic music]

38:01.167 --> 38:03.125
Freeze! Drop them!

38:05.125 --> 38:06.458
Alright.

38:06.542 --> 38:09.042
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

38:10.958 --> 38:12.542
To the future.

38:12.625 --> 38:14.167
[crunch]

38:17.667 --> 38:19.208
Holy..

38:19.292 --> 38:22.708
[beeps]
Zack to Medlab.
We need a team in Bay 3 ASAP.

38:22.792 --> 38:25.375
Two men down.
Looks like cyanide caps.

38:28.750 --> 38:29.917
Great.

38:41.708 --> 38:43.208
- How'd it go?
- Don't ask.

38:43.292 --> 38:45.542
But I think we got the interface
worked out for the new system.

38:45.625 --> 38:47.917
I'll know when I try it.
I better go tell the captain.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.708
Well, I'd wait a little while
if I were you.

38:49.792 --> 38:51.792
I don't think he's in
a very good mood right now.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.417
Mr. Garibaldi, I've got
three dead bodies on the deck.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.542
One in Downbelow,
two in Bay 3.

39:02.625 --> 39:04.292
Now would you be so kind
as to tell me

39:04.375 --> 39:06.083
just what the hell happened?

39:06.167 --> 39:08.208
I'm as much in the dark
as you are, captain.

39:08.292 --> 39:09.875
They just came at us.

39:09.958 --> 39:13.500
- And the man they shot?
- No idea.

39:13.583 --> 39:16.042
He was there to meet
with a client of mine.

39:16.125 --> 39:18.583
Now you can assume that
I don't know what it was about

39:18.667 --> 39:20.250
or you can assume that I'm lying

39:20.333 --> 39:22.000
to protect the privacy
of my clients.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.250
But either way, that's all
you're gonna get out of me.

39:24.333 --> 39:25.750
You've jeopardized this station.

39:25.833 --> 39:27.792
And you damn near got me killed.

39:27.875 --> 39:29.375
Now I could have got out of
there a hell of a lot easier

39:29.458 --> 39:31.083
with two less bodies on the deck
if you hadn't canceled

39:31.167 --> 39:33.708
my identicard and taken my gun.

39:33.792 --> 39:36.417
Now as far as I can see,
I haven't broken any laws here.

39:38.083 --> 39:39.792
Trespassing.

39:39.875 --> 39:41.542
Violating station security.

39:41.625 --> 39:43.500
Unauthorized use
of an identicard.

39:43.583 --> 39:45.083
Come on, that's small-time
and you know it.

39:45.167 --> 39:48.458
You wanna fine me, go ahead.
I can afford it.

39:48.542 --> 39:52.375
Beyond that,
you got nothing.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.125
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go take a shower

39:54.208 --> 39:56.417
and get some sleep because
I have had a very long day.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.583
Mr. Garibaldi.

39:59.417 --> 40:02.625
You operate on this station
at my sufferance.

40:02.708 --> 40:05.417
I can shut you down
if I choose to do so.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.292
Anything like this
ever happens again

40:07.375 --> 40:09.250
that's precisely what I'll do.

40:22.750 --> 40:26.792
(Ivanova)
'Team three, can you give me
an ETA on collector attachment?'

40:26.875 --> 40:29.292
(male #3)
'Roger, Control. We're moving
the collector into position'

40:29.375 --> 40:31.833
'and should achieve
lockdown in seven.'

40:31.917 --> 40:33.917
(Ivanova)
'Attachment team,
did you copy that?'

40:34.667 --> 40:36.250
[computer beeps]

40:38.625 --> 40:40.958
Oh, great. What now?

40:42.542 --> 40:44.500
Computer, what have you got?

40:44.583 --> 40:47.708
[automated message]
'Voice authorization needed
to deliver waiting message.'

40:47.792 --> 40:51.000
- From whom?
- 'Lise Hampton.'

40:51.083 --> 40:55.250
- Not Lise Hampton-Edgars?
- 'Lise Hampton.'

40:57.417 --> 41:00.125
No, that's all over.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.458
Delete message.

41:03.917 --> 41:05.958
Just let it go.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.667
[computer beeps]

41:21.292 --> 41:22.875
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:24.625 --> 41:26.250
What is it?

41:26.333 --> 41:28.083
(Bill Edgars)
'Is this Mr. Garibaldi?'

41:28.167 --> 41:31.042
- Yeah. Who's this?
- 'William Edgars.'

41:31.125 --> 41:33.375
(William)
'I wanted you to know
that Lise has arrived home'

41:33.458 --> 41:35.208
'safe and sound.'

41:35.292 --> 41:37.458
Good. That's good.
Anything else?

41:37.542 --> 41:40.042
'I heard what you did
and how you did it.'

41:40.125 --> 41:42.292
'You handled yourself well
under pressure'

41:42.375 --> 41:44.958
'and you saved the life
of my wife.'

41:45.042 --> 41:48.042
- 'Thank you.'
- Just part of the service.

41:48.125 --> 41:52.417
'Perhaps. I've done some
checking on you, Mr. Garibaldi.'

41:52.500 --> 41:55.125
'My organization could use
a man like you.'

41:55.208 --> 41:58.208
'I'd like to hire you
on retainer.'

41:58.292 --> 41:59.750
'You'd have to come here
to Mars'

41:59.833 --> 42:03.583
'but I promise I can make it
worth your while.'

42:03.667 --> 42:06.917
- What about the quarantine?
- 'Shouldn't be a problem.'

42:07.000 --> 42:08.500
'You've quit
as head of security'

42:08.583 --> 42:10.708
'so frankly,
I don't think anyone'

42:10.792 --> 42:12.917
'is much interested
in you anymore.'

42:13.000 --> 42:14.958
'And if they are, well'

42:15.042 --> 42:17.625
'I have some influence
with the government.'

42:17.708 --> 42:21.458
'I'm sure we can work this out,
if you're interested.'

42:23.292 --> 42:24.333
Yeah.

42:26.125 --> 42:27.500
I'm interested.

42:30.250 --> 42:32.583
[beeps]

42:32.667 --> 42:35.917
This is Commander Susan Ivanova
of Babylon 5

42:36.000 --> 42:37.833
and this is the first
official broadcast

42:37.917 --> 42:39.792
of the new
"Voice Of The Resistance."

42:39.875 --> 42:42.667
We're sending this signal out
to every ship that wants to hear

42:42.750 --> 42:45.750
the truth, to our fallen
comrades and freedom fighters

42:45.833 --> 42:48.625
on Mars, in Proxima III
and to Earth

42:48.708 --> 42:50.500
which, despite
what you may have heard

42:50.583 --> 42:53.250
is still our home
and still the one dream

42:53.333 --> 42:55.625
that we are as loyal to now
as we ever have been.

42:55.708 --> 42:57.375
Over the last three years

42:57.458 --> 42:59.958
ever since President Clark
took over after arranging

43:00.042 --> 43:01.917
the assassination
of President Santiago

43:02.000 --> 43:04.625
you've been hearing nothing
but misinformation

43:04.708 --> 43:07.583
propaganda and outright lies.

43:07.667 --> 43:09.833
Now we're going
to tell you the truth.

43:09.917 --> 43:12.500
And we're gonna keep telling it
until they shut us down

43:12.583 --> 43:14.833
or until President Clark
steps down and returns Earth

43:14.917 --> 43:16.417
to the hands of its people.

43:16.500 --> 43:18.917
You can kill us,
you can bomb our colonies

43:19.000 --> 43:21.333
destroy our ships,
murder innocent civilians

43:21.417 --> 43:23.625
but you cannot kill the truth.

43:23.708 --> 43:27.208
And the truth
is back in business.

43:34.333 --> 43:37.375
