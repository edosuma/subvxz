00:48.674 --> 00:52.261
You wait until you get a load of this lab,Wolfy.

00:52.344 --> 00:55.973
It's the most marvelous,splendiferous, stupendous lab.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.601
The most magnifi-super-frabjous lab.It's the most--

00:59.685 --> 01:01.103
It's tree labs, bro.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.397
Xandra, you ruined the surprise.

01:10.696 --> 01:11.864
Wow.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.367
So, this is where you make trees?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.452
And so much more.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.263
Come on, Wolfboy,let's go make some trees.

01:43.729 --> 01:48.108
Well done, Sprout. Such a joyto have a Figwort in the class again.

01:49.359 --> 01:54.323
You know, I always thought that treescame from seeds and acorns and such.

01:54.406 --> 01:57.492
You've got a lot to learnabout how the world really works, human.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.954
Don't worry about her.Here, let me show you.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.127
See, we sprytes make some trees,

02:07.211 --> 02:10.464
but the world needs lotsand lots of trees.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.550
The clever thingscan also make themselves.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.519
What happens now?

02:23.602 --> 02:26.021
Now we wait.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.443
For how long?

02:31.527 --> 02:34.988
Ten years, give or take.Isn't it exciting?

02:37.032 --> 02:38.200
Look who it is.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.703
Everyone, please welcome Flora Figwort.

02:41.787 --> 02:46.208
An excellent student in her day,and now a qualified forest spryte.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.336
Keep practicingand you could be like Flora one day.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.505
Hey, that's my sister.

02:51.588 --> 02:56.301
Flora! Flora! Flora! Flora! Flora!

02:56.385 --> 03:01.098
Flora! Flora! Flora! Flora! Flora!

03:01.181 --> 03:03.350
Flora! Flora!

03:04.977 --> 03:06.228
Hi.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.608
Professor. There's something strangegoing on in our wood.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.527
We could really use a hand.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.946
Could I getsome volunteer sprytelings to help?

03:16.029 --> 03:17.281
By all means.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.949
Would anyone like to volunteer?

03:20.075 --> 03:23.287
Me! Me, me, me. Right here! Me! Hello!

03:24.037 --> 03:26.456
-Me! Right here!-Anyone else?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.500
-Anyone at all. Xandra?-Me! Hello!

03:28.584 --> 03:30.752
Sure, Flora. But can I bring Sprout?

03:32.963 --> 03:33.964
Fine.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.634
Hooray! Can I bring Wolfboy?

03:38.719 --> 03:39.761
Fine.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.599
Cool. Another portal.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.565
Here we are. Welcome to my wood.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.276
It's usually a much happier place.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.279
What's making the trees so sick?

03:57.362 --> 04:02.534
I don't know, Sprout. I've never seenanything like it before. Poor things.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.091
There's something not rightabout this fog.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.469
What could be causing it?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.596
Maybe humans.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.640
Humans do have a lot to answer for.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.268
I mean, they chop down our treesfaster than we can make them.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.229
But this is different.

04:32.022 --> 04:35.067
Pardon me, madam. How are you holding up?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.282
She's in pretty bad shape.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.952
I'm gonna see if I can help her.

04:45.035 --> 04:50.165
It's getting pretty hard to seein this fog. And it's getting dark too.

04:50.832 --> 04:54.169
Why don't you sit tight for a second,and I'll be right back.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.974
You don't think…

05:07.057 --> 05:11.270
You don't think it's possiblethat there are disarrays in these woods,

05:11.353 --> 05:12.521
do you, Xandra?

05:12.604 --> 05:15.315
Disarrays? I shouldn't think so, Sprout.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.984
What are disaroos?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.777
It's "disarrays."

05:18.861 --> 05:23.490
Disarrays are the most horrible,terrible, dark, scary creatures

05:23.574 --> 05:26.201
in the whole entire universe.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.953
I don't like to talk about them.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.037
I'm--

05:29.121 --> 05:30.789
Around every corner,

05:30.873 --> 05:36.587
the disarrays lurk and seek to destroythe sprytes' noble work.

05:37.379 --> 05:41.049
Some slither, some swim,some float and some fly.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.887
But beware of any creaturewith the glowing eye.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.807
They creep and they crawl,bringing darkness and woe.

05:49.391 --> 05:53.228
We are the sprytes, and they are our foe.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.691
Disarrays are pure chaos.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.401
Agents of destruction.

05:59.484 --> 06:03.280
Every single thing we sprytes create,disarrays destroy.

06:03.363 --> 06:07.534
I wish there was one here right now.I'd show 'em who's boss.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.664
Hey, Xandra? If Sprout's over there,whose shadow is that?

06:17.336 --> 06:19.421
Sprout! Xandra! Look out!

06:20.172 --> 06:21.215
Disarrays!

06:30.057 --> 06:32.226
That's where the fog came from.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.645
Those creeps are fogging upthe whole wood.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.980
No wonder these trees are sick.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.232
What do we do?

06:38.315 --> 06:39.316
We fight.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.984
No, we run.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.278
Come on. Back to the portal.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.038
This way.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.263
Stop. Stop.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.349
We're just going in circles.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.226
Did we lose Flora?

07:14.726 --> 07:19.898
-Flora! Flora!-Sprout. It's going to be okay.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.401
But what if the disarrays come back?

07:22.484 --> 07:24.319
They could be right behind us.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.738
They could be anywhere.

07:30.576 --> 07:35.622
Why did I volunteer for this?Mother warned me about being brave.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.877
"Always listen to Mother."That's what Mother always says.

07:41.086 --> 07:44.798
Sprout, you've got a little something--

07:49.178 --> 07:51.013
Get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off!

07:51.096 --> 07:52.723
Stay still, Sprout.

07:59.438 --> 08:03.734
It's not the fog that's hurting the trees.It's these slugs.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.528
That's why those creepsare fogging up the place.

08:06.612 --> 08:10.657
To hide what their gross little slug chumsare up to.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.743
So if we clear the fog…

08:12.826 --> 08:15.162
We can start kicking some slug butt.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.496
Yeah!

08:16.580 --> 08:18.749
But how do we get rid of the fog?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.669
I think I know just the way.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.173
It's perfect.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.925
It's a hunk of junk.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.551
It's not junk.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.179
All we need is a bit of imagination.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.097
And some tape.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.307
What's tape?

08:35.390 --> 08:37.683
Here. Give me a hand.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.368
Well, it's still junk.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.246
But I guess you've made it your own.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.791
Ready? Go.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.004
It's actually working?

09:07.005 --> 09:08.882
It's actually working!

09:08.966 --> 09:11.802
All right, let's do this.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.295
Sprout! Sprout!

09:46.378 --> 09:48.505
Flora? Flora!

09:48.589 --> 09:54.011
Sprout! Thank goodnessyou're okay. I was so worried.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.347
We were searching for you everywhere,but the fog--

09:57.431 --> 10:00.142
Wait. What happened to the fog?

10:00.225 --> 10:02.060
I cleared it away.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.938
Wolfboy and Xandra, they helped.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.566
You cleared it away? How?

10:08.150 --> 10:12.196
We found this weird human contraption.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.907
Over there, in the woods.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.534
And once the fog was gone,the slugs were easy.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.953
-The slugs?-Rotter slugs.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.705
Pesky little disarrays.

10:22.206 --> 10:25.209
But pretty easy to deal withif you can see 'em.

10:26.043 --> 10:29.838
I've never seen different typesof disarray work together like that.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.846
It looks likeyou three have saved our wood.

10:42.476 --> 10:43.602
Oh, no.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.522
The poor old thing didn't make it.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.293
Hey, Sprout, look.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.927
Into the dirt with you.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.017
Maybe we can come back and visit?

11:24.101 --> 11:25.477
Sure thing, Sprout.

11:52.588 --> 11:56.175
Okay, Sprout. Ready? One.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.384
One.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.137
You're supposed to say "two."

12:00.220 --> 12:01.346
Three.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.016
-Two!-Sprout, you're playing wrong.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.893
But it's fun.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.060
Five.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.187
Crumpet!

12:12.858 --> 12:17.487
Oh, my twigs and leaves!They're playing Guardians and Disarrays.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.406
Disarrays?

12:19.489 --> 12:22.075
Not real ones. It's just a silly game.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.786
Cool! Do you wanna go play?

12:24.870 --> 12:28.832
No way. I'm reading all aboutthe fifth battle of Dryades.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.375
And I'm getting to the good bit.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.419
Who's Dryades?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.547
Dryades is the name for the portal tree.

12:36.215 --> 12:40.886
You know, the one in the middleof the atrium. Kind of hard to miss.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.430
Its roots runthroughout the whole factory,

12:43.514 --> 12:46.225
and it connects all the labsto the surface.

12:47.226 --> 12:50.729
That's what that is. That's awesome.

12:50.812 --> 12:54.816
Now, if you don't mind,go play with Sprout or something.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.235
What's wrong, Sprout?

12:57.528 --> 12:59.530
They won't let me play.

12:59.613 --> 13:03.408
What? We'll see about that.Come on, Sprout.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.578
Wait! Wolfboy! Wolfboy!

13:07.371 --> 13:10.541
I told you it's dorms against dorms.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.794
And your dorm isn't here. So bye-bye.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.797
I'm in Sprout's dorm.We'll play as a team.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.091
You need five to make a team.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.052
Well, then we'll all play.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.554
Hooray!

13:23.637 --> 13:24.847
What are you doing?

13:24.930 --> 13:26.139
We can't play.

13:26.223 --> 13:29.226
You don't even know what this game is.And Sprout…

13:34.898 --> 13:38.735
Well, I love Sprout,but we don't stand a chance.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.153
We'll lose.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.323
I don't know. I'm pretty good at games.

13:43.407 --> 13:46.827
I'm sure I'll pick it up.And besides, it'll be fun.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.579
Come on.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.373
Didn't you hear me? We'll lose.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.587
Xandra, come play.

13:56.670 --> 14:00.174
Sorry, Sprout.You need your whole dorm to play.

14:00.257 --> 14:03.844
It's a shame Xandra's sucha scaredy-spryte.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.430
Scaredy-spryte?

14:08.223 --> 14:11.226
Right. Let's do this now.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.603
Yeah!

14:21.778 --> 14:23.655
Okay, the rules are simple.

14:23.739 --> 14:26.408
We're the disarrays.We gotta get to that rock.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.952
And they're the guardians,so they have to stop us.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.955
Then next round, we switch sides. Get it?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.248
-Got it.-Good.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.292
Guardians!

14:35.792 --> 14:37.294
Disarrays!

14:45.219 --> 14:46.553
Go!

14:48.889 --> 14:51.725
Oh, yeah.And if you get orbed, you're out.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.852
Orbed? What do you mean, "orbed"?

15:07.032 --> 15:08.825
Sprout, keep up!

15:29.680 --> 15:31.014
Wolfboy, move!

15:34.226 --> 15:36.979
Come on. I can't believe you guys.

15:40.774 --> 15:44.111
I hate to admit it, Xandra,but you were right.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.321
Maybe you shouldn't have played.

15:52.703 --> 15:55.330
Come on. Now we're the guardians.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.333
You'll be great at this bit, Xandra.

15:58.417 --> 16:03.505
Hey, you better pull your socks up, human.Sprout needs us to win.

16:17.978 --> 16:21.732
Guardians and Disarrays.I remember this game.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.568
Guardians.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.570
Disarrays.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.155
Go!

16:52.930 --> 16:55.599
Yes! In your shiny face!

17:09.570 --> 17:11.531
Okay, we're disarrays again.

17:11.615 --> 17:16.078
Blip, you go left. Oneira, take the right.I'll head straight for the rock and--

17:16.161 --> 17:17.579
Wait, wait, wait.

17:17.663 --> 17:20.665
Am I the squiggly wormor the shivering snake?

17:20.749 --> 17:22.084
That's not a snake.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.502
It's clearly a lightning bolt.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.381
I don't know. It looks like a snake to me.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.466
There's no snakes! Forget snakes!

17:29.550 --> 17:34.388
Hey, whoa, Xandra. Take it easy.It's just a bit of fun.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.306
You think losing is fun?

17:36.390 --> 17:38.976
We have to win. For Sprout's sake.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.479
Really? For Sprout's sake?

17:42.980 --> 17:44.147
Guardians.

17:44.982 --> 17:46.149
Disarrays.

17:47.985 --> 17:48.986
Sprout!

17:49.069 --> 17:51.530
Remember, throw some orbs or something.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.865
Go!

17:52.948 --> 17:55.242
Orbs coming right up.

18:00.289 --> 18:03.375
Oh, my… Never mind. Wolfboy, you--

18:03.458 --> 18:06.962
Don't worry, Xandra.It's all in the wrist.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.509
Hey, you two.

18:15.596 --> 18:19.558
You have to admit it is pretty funnyhow bad you all are.

18:21.185 --> 18:22.186
Also…

18:29.693 --> 18:33.780
Hey, laughlings.You think this is some sort of game?

18:35.741 --> 18:36.742
Yes.

18:41.538 --> 18:44.833
Awesome! Amazing! Let's go!

18:46.793 --> 18:48.170
Guardians.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.671
Disarrays.

18:49.755 --> 18:50.756
Go!

18:50.839 --> 18:52.257
Slide right, slide right!

18:52.341 --> 18:55.093
No, your other right. No, the other way!

19:03.310 --> 19:05.938
No, no, no!

19:07.689 --> 19:14.655
Xandra, I think I might havefractured my aura.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.616
Yeah, me too.

19:22.788 --> 19:25.916
And what about you? Are you injured too?

19:25.999 --> 19:28.627
I suppose I'm gonna haveto win this thing on my own.

19:28.710 --> 19:32.589
You know, I never had many friendsbefore I came here,

19:32.673 --> 19:35.133
so nobody knows this better than I do.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.763
Winning's not much funif you're on your own.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.394
Look, they're kissing.

19:48.689 --> 19:52.734
Hey, Sprout. I didn't thinkyou'd be any good, but I was wrong.

19:52.818 --> 19:56.405
You're the best player… on our team.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.407
Why, thank you.

20:02.744 --> 20:06.540
Hey, Xandra,you could always join our dorm.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.376
Then you might actuallystand a chance of winning.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.214
Hey, Tali,

20:14.298 --> 20:20.637
I'd rather lose a million gameswith Sprout than win one point with you.

20:20.721 --> 20:23.724
-Come on, Wolfboy.-But we're down to three players.

20:23.807 --> 20:24.808
Don't we forfeit?

20:24.892 --> 20:29.521
No way. We're doing this for Sprout.

20:29.605 --> 20:31.857
Yeah, for Sprout.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.484
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:34.568 --> 20:36.862
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:42.492 --> 20:44.077

20:44.161 --> 20:45.787

20:48.582 --> 20:49.666
Go!

20:55.506 --> 20:56.673
Xandra!

20:56.757 --> 20:58.091
Orbs on your left.

21:01.512 --> 21:03.096
Wow, good shot.

21:23.242 --> 21:24.368
Xandra!

21:26.662 --> 21:30.541
Once again, I win the game.Nobody can beat--

21:31.583 --> 21:32.918
Tali's out.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.461
And Sprout's still in!

21:34.545 --> 21:36.171
Run, Sprout, run!

21:39.842 --> 21:41.218
Run the other way!

21:41.802 --> 21:43.053
Whoopsie-doo.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.496
Sprout.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.669

22:30.058 --> 22:31.768
Why is everyone cheering?

22:31.852 --> 22:36.106
We won. By a lot.You only scored one point.

22:37.274 --> 22:38.442
Fun though.

22:41.653 --> 22:44.448
Sprout! Sprout! Sprout!

22:44.531 --> 22:48.285
Sprout! Sprout! Sprout!
