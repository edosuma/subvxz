WEBVTT

00:19.186 --> 00:20.103
Abby.

00:21.604 --> 00:22.689
Hey.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.319
We need to talk.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.530
Yeah.

00:32.740 --> 00:33.866
You wanna go inside?

00:34.451 --> 00:36.703
No. I need to finish this, so...

00:37.454 --> 00:38.455
Damn.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.668
I just need to finish this.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.923
Uh... before you say anything--

00:49.006 --> 00:50.425
After the other night, I went home,

00:50.508 --> 00:52.135
and I put a cigarette out
on our prom picture.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.262
And our winter formal picture.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.515
Not our homecoming picture,
'cause my hair looked fuckin' awesome.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.727
I never wanted to think about you again.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.562
I was so pissed at you.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.939
[stammers] Then I started worryin'
about how you were doin',

01:05.022 --> 01:06.858
which pissed me off even more.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.861
So, how you doin', you fuckin' asshole?

01:13.490 --> 01:14.574
Heather's keeping the baby.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.033
Oh, my God!

01:16.868 --> 01:20.538
Would you stop tellin' me things?
Can't I just come over here one time

01:20.622 --> 01:24.000
and the only news be,
"Hey, I made a grilled cheese"?

01:25.460 --> 01:26.461
I'm sorry.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.632
We just... We got to the clinic and she...
she couldn't go through with it.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.259
[sighs] Jesus, Colt.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.802
This whole thing is like
a relentless shitstorm.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.597
[stammers] How am I supposed
to react to this?

01:38.306 --> 01:40.933
-[stutters] I was hoping--
-Don't interrupt me!

01:41.017 --> 01:42.935
You know what the worst part is?
I can't even be mad.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.772
Who am I gonna be mad at?
Heather, for wanting to keep her baby?

01:45.855 --> 01:49.359
You, for wanting to support her?
The baby? It's a fucking baby!

01:50.193 --> 01:51.903
-I get that this--
-I'm not done! Okay?

01:51.986 --> 01:53.405
[stutters] What's the deal, huh?

01:53.488 --> 01:55.698
You're just gonna... [sighs]

01:55.782 --> 01:58.410
have a kid with another woman
and I'm supposed to go along with it?

02:00.412 --> 02:01.913
Well, say somethin'!

02:03.498 --> 02:04.916
I don't know what to say. I...

02:05.792 --> 02:06.876
[sighs]

02:08.211 --> 02:10.380
I love you, and I wanna be with you,

02:10.463 --> 02:13.049
but I also...
I get how messed up all this is.

02:15.968 --> 02:17.094
[sighs]

02:18.012 --> 02:19.096
Yeah, it really is.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.524
[Abby groans]

02:32.694 --> 02:33.903
[sighs]

02:42.620 --> 02:44.747
I'm not gettin' you
a fuckin' baby shower gift.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.167
That's fair.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.505
Is that an Oreo Blizzard?

02:54.173 --> 02:55.675
-Yeah.
-Give it to me.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.472
-Did you get the fudge core?
-No.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.056
Ugh, you're the worst.

03:10.189 --> 03:11.233
We'll get through this.

03:13.860 --> 03:14.861
"We"?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.740
Yeah, didn't you hear the part
where I said "I love you"?

03:19.866 --> 03:20.867
No.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.453
I heard the part where you said
I was the worst.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.247
Well...

03:28.750 --> 03:29.917
I meant I love you.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.715
I love you, too.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.051
Ugh, you're the worst.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.432
[theme song playing]

04:47.329 --> 04:50.122
Just to be clear,
this food belongs to the bar.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.625
It's only here temporarily.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.795
-Same goes for you.
-[chuckles]

04:56.379 --> 04:58.381
-Love you, too, Daddy.
-Get away.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.300
[Colt] Hey.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.719
What's with all the food?

05:02.802 --> 05:05.137
Oh, shit. Are the Russians comin'?
Are we hunkerin' down?

05:05.722 --> 05:08.725
No, dummy.
The bar flooded, the freezer shorted,

05:08.808 --> 05:10.602
so now we're moving
all the shit over here.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.396
Dad's insultin' me,
Mom wants to sell the bar...

05:13.480 --> 05:14.606
And if you're gonna wear
a shirt like that,

05:14.689 --> 05:15.815
you need to start doin' more curls.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.444
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, you're sellin' the bar?

05:19.527 --> 05:21.278
Oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.492
So what?
You gonna, like, buy another bar?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.704
Hey, you gonna help us?
Or just stand there lookin' pretty?

05:29.787 --> 05:32.289
[scoffs] I mean,
I can't stop lookin' pretty, so...

05:32.374 --> 05:36.335
Oh, hey, uh, by the way...
I got something I wanna tell everyone.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.464
Oh, hey, uh, Heather's keeping the baby.
Colt's gonna be a dad.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.257
What the fuck, dude?

05:42.550 --> 05:43.718
I got a text from Mary.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.721
I didn't wanna ruin it for them.
I did wanna ruin it for you.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.848
Oh, my God, you're gonna be a dad!

05:48.931 --> 05:49.932
-[both chuckle]
-[Colt] Yeah.

05:50.016 --> 05:53.352
[gasps] Oh, my God. You're gonna be a dad.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.937
That's the same thing I said.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.356
Congratulations, Colt.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.901
I got some old phone books
if you need a car seat.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.405
Yeah, I'm happy for you, dude.
Now, look,

06:03.488 --> 06:06.616
whatever you do, don't let that kid
grow up to play for the Chiefs.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.576
Come on. We don't know
if it's gonna be a boy or a girl--

06:08.660 --> 06:11.078
Hey, I'm just sayin'.
Fuck the Chiefs.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.748
Hey, uh, you know what the best part is?

06:13.831 --> 06:15.082
Abby ain't even mad.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.251
I mean, well, she was.
She was, like, really mad.

06:17.334 --> 06:20.797
And then she was only kind of mad,
and now she's, like, just normal mad.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.715
But she says
that's just part of datin' me.

06:23.340 --> 06:25.217
Also a part of being your mother.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.429
-And your brother.
-And your father.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.848
Oh, by the way, Dad,

06:30.932 --> 06:32.600
I got a bunch of stuff
I gotta do tomorrow,

06:32.684 --> 06:34.393
so I don't think I can go
to that cattle auction with you.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.853
Fine with me.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.773
The only thing I want riding shotgun
with me is my shotgun.

06:38.856 --> 06:39.857
[Rooster chuckles]

06:40.483 --> 06:42.860
-You're going to that auction, aren't you?
-Yeah.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.111
Well, you guys should go together.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.238
-What?
-[chuckles] Fuck that.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.702
What's going on between you two,
it's stupid.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.287
It's just ridiculous to drive four hours

06:53.370 --> 06:56.415
in two trucks when you're going
to the same damn place.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.251
Stop this nonsense and act like grown men.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.632
[sighs] Fine. I'll be here at 8:00.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.760
-5:30.
-[scoffs] Shit.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.639
Dad, the roads are really icy.
You should probably leave at 5:00.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.641
Great idea.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.809
See you at 5:00.

07:16.644 --> 07:17.687
Thanks, asshole.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.816
Yeah, I didn't wanna ruin it for him.
I did want to ruin it for you.

07:27.489 --> 07:30.492
-Installing some new windows?
-Yeah.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.870
[grunts] I had to punch out the old ones
at the Arby's drive-thru.

07:35.121 --> 07:39.291
Before I forget,
here's a to-do list for while I'm gone.

07:42.086 --> 07:45.131
[chuckles] "Don't fuck up."

07:46.048 --> 07:48.425
I guess it's more of a to-don't list.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.928
As in "to-don't fuck up my ranch."

07:52.346 --> 07:54.682
Don't worry.
I'll get all my work done.

07:55.266 --> 07:58.520
I gotta take Abby and her parents
to breakfast. [sighs]

07:59.812 --> 08:01.606
We're gonna tell 'em about the baby.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.232
You want my advice?

08:03.816 --> 08:05.985
-Sure.
-Read the note.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.571
[vehicle approaching]

08:10.031 --> 08:11.240
What the hell?

08:14.994 --> 08:17.163
Holy shit!

08:17.246 --> 08:19.791
Yeah.
[grunts] I know.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.251
I not only wanna have sex in this truck...

08:23.252 --> 08:25.004
I wanna have sex with this truck.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.090
[Colt] Damn.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.052
It's like what the pope would drive
if he was a redneck.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.764
-Where'd you get this?
-Got it last night from Neumann's Hill.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.223
Just one of the perks.

08:36.808 --> 08:40.186
Along with my self-respect
and a fat weekly paycheck.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.857
How you doin', Colt? Still throwin' up
trash bag windows? That's cool.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.861
So they just gave you this, huh?

08:48.945 --> 08:50.988
-Yes, sir.
-[Beau] Makes sense.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.116
No real American would buy a Toyota.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.243
So they gotta give 'em away.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.039
[chuckles] Yeah, somebody hates the USA.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.668
I'll give you three reasons
why you're wrong.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.378
One, built in Texas.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.716
Two, Kyle Busch drives a Toyota.
Three...

09:10.717 --> 09:12.259
[clicks tongue] suck my balls.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.930
Let's get goin'.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.432
Yeah, all right, just help me, uh,
throw the trailer on.

09:18.515 --> 09:21.185
You think I'm gettin'
into this rolling billboard

09:21.268 --> 09:22.394
-for Neumann's Hill?
-[scoffing]

09:22.478 --> 09:24.021
Jeez, Dad. Come on, man.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.066
It's got heated seats,
satellite radio, ECO mode...

09:27.149 --> 09:30.194
Did you just say "ECO mode"
in my driveway?

09:31.320 --> 09:34.240
Hey, Dad, Rooster told me
he voted for Hillary.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.742
Have a good ride, buddy.

09:41.038 --> 09:45.459
So, we're on the ski lift
and who's on the chair in front of us?

09:45.542 --> 09:46.919
Mr. Pat Sajak.

09:48.462 --> 09:52.759
So when we got off, I said to him,
"I would like to solve this puzzle.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.012
What the heck are you doing
in Beaver Creek, Mr. Sajak?"

09:56.095 --> 09:58.764
[chuckles] Well, it wasn't him.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.687
You know, I once, uh, didn't meet
Alex Trebek in a Chili's. [chuckles]

10:06.731 --> 10:10.151
Okay. So, we wanted to get together...

10:10.777 --> 10:12.361
because we have a little news.

10:12.444 --> 10:15.072
-Oh, God, they're getting married.
-Honey, have you thought this through?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.199
It's not that. But good to know
that's how that would've gone.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.493
Colt?

10:20.577 --> 10:21.788
-Right.
-Yeah.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.373
Uh...

10:25.499 --> 10:26.583
How do I say this?

10:27.543 --> 10:31.631
You know, sometimes in life,
things happen that we don't expect.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.590
Oh, God, you got Abby pregnant.

10:33.675 --> 10:37.469
No. No. That... that would be bad.
That would be, like, very bad.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.056
He got his ex-girlfriend pregnant.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.598
Are you kidding me?

10:41.683 --> 10:43.685
But hey,
at least we're not gettin' married.

10:44.476 --> 10:46.103
Look, we weren't together
at the time, all right?

10:46.187 --> 10:48.564
And I know it's not an ideal situation...

10:49.982 --> 10:51.901
but we're gonna get through this together.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.402
What are we gonna tell people?

10:53.485 --> 10:55.154
I don't know, Mom.
Maybe the truth?

10:56.572 --> 10:59.951
Or, whatever you're comfortable
tellin' people.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.453
[stutters] You know,
I want everything out in the open.

11:04.831 --> 11:05.915
Or not.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.000
It's up to you.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.253
Colt, could we have a moment with Abby?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.547
-Yes, sir.
-Sit down.

11:13.630 --> 11:14.841
Yes, ma'am.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.134
Whatever you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Colt.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.219
Fine.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.847
What does this guy have to do

11:20.930 --> 11:22.890
to make you realize
you shouldn't be with him?

11:22.974 --> 11:25.101
-Dad.
-No, I'm serious.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.729
Does he have to knock somebody else up?
Get arrested?

11:27.812 --> 11:31.023
-Break your heart for the umpteenth time?
-Chuck, maybe this isn't the time.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.400
Of course it is.
You wanna wait till she's pregnant?

11:35.569 --> 11:37.529
Abby, I love you.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.699
And I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your life.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.870
But you deserve so much better than him.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.217
-Sorry.
-Will you talk to Dad?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.970
And tell him what?
That he's wrong?

12:01.888 --> 12:02.930
Because he's not.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.267
[sighs]

12:12.982 --> 12:14.650
[country music playing
over truck speakers]

12:14.733 --> 12:16.735
Be faster if you take Route 50.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.031
Who told you that?
Your little phone?

12:21.573 --> 12:22.658
As a matter of fact, yeah.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.743
It says there's an accident up ahead.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.121
If there was an accident,
I'd know about it.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.375
Shouldn't you be in a better mood?
You got a grandkid comin'.

12:31.458 --> 12:34.336
It will be nice to have
a little Bennett around.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.840
-Teach him how to hunt, how to fish...
-[sighs]

12:38.800 --> 12:40.592
...how to clean out the septic tank.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.930
His little arms will come in handy.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.264
[laughs]

12:46.015 --> 12:47.975
You feed 'em, you change 'em and...

12:48.935 --> 12:51.187
you distract 'em
when they're becomin' annoying.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.647
Hey, look at that plane over there.

12:53.730 --> 12:55.066
Ooh, that's a big one.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.114
[sighs]

13:02.198 --> 13:04.366
So you think
Mom's really gonna sell the bar?

13:04.951 --> 13:05.952
I don't know.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.038
Why don't you ask
that magic phone of yours?

13:11.248 --> 13:13.918
-Fine, I will.
-[chuckles]

13:16.212 --> 13:18.047
Is Mom really gonna sell the bar?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.967
[automated voice]  I'm afraid
I don't know the answer to that, Rooster.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.219
How the fuck did it do that?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.347
When am I gonna die?

13:30.642 --> 13:33.520
-Here's to my parents hating you.
-I'll drink to that.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.647
-For the rest of my life.
-[both chuckle]

13:35.731 --> 13:37.984
To drinkin' for the rest of our lives!

13:42.779 --> 13:44.573
-Ah. [grunts]
-[grunts]

13:44.656 --> 13:49.245
All right, I'm headin' back to the ranch.
I gotta plow that feed path.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.039
Your dad already hates me.
I don't need my dad hatin' me, too.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.708
-Uh, Colt-- [chuckles]
-Just let me lie to myself.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.961
You wanna come with?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.463
No, I'm good. I'm gonna stay here
and have another drink.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.382
All right.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.260
You okay?

14:04.343 --> 14:05.594
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:05.677 --> 14:07.679
I mean, my parents have hated you
since middle school.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.349
We didn't start datin' till high school.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.934
Yeah, I know.

14:12.684 --> 14:15.062
[chuckles] I'll be good.
I'll catch up with you later.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.526
Whoo! That's good.
I need another one.

14:20.609 --> 14:21.610
That's my girl.

14:21.693 --> 14:23.820
-She's a teacher.
-[both chuckle]

14:25.739 --> 14:26.991
[Rooster sighs]

14:27.867 --> 14:29.994
Dale said he was over at your ranch.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.038
Said you're doing all right.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.582
Yeah, well, Dale's a good guy.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.335
He'll compliment anyone who's payin' him.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.589
Yeah, that's the thing.

14:43.590 --> 14:46.052
Neumann's Hill won't let me
hire him as my vet.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.469
Not sure how to break the news.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.057
What was your move for firing people?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.685
Generally, I just pissed them off
till they quit.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.272
[Rooster chuckles]

14:58.355 --> 15:01.775
Yeah, well, I'd try that,
but I'm not a crotchety old bastard.

15:01.858 --> 15:04.528
Have a couple of dumbass kids.
You'll get there.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.953
[exhales] You guys want another drink?

15:12.036 --> 15:14.663
Does a tornado always find
the trailer park?

15:14.746 --> 15:15.998
[laughs]

15:17.083 --> 15:19.919
Shirley, you're a hoot!
Hank, don't you fuck this up.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.713
Okay.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.674
We allowed to do that?

15:26.758 --> 15:28.219
[exclaims]

15:28.302 --> 15:30.137
[chuckles] Here you go.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.263
Abby.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.390
Hey.

15:33.975 --> 15:37.103
Hey! Hi, Heather.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.314
What's with all the blondes?
Is this a Viking town?

15:41.398 --> 15:43.192
I'm just gonna say it.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.029
This is fuckin' weird.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.197
Yeah.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.657
-I'm just here to pick up some food.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:50.741 --> 15:54.453
I was at the gas station. I was gonna
get one of those hotdogs on the rollers,

15:54.536 --> 15:56.288
and then I realized I'm at the gas station

15:56.372 --> 15:59.458
and I'm gonna get
one of those hotdogs on the rollers.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.544
Well, the kitchen's closed here.
There was a...

16:02.628 --> 16:04.463
[blows raspberry] flood.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.674
Well...

16:07.758 --> 16:09.760
[whispering] how are you doing?

16:10.844 --> 16:12.596
-Good. Yeah.
-Yeah? Okay.

16:12.679 --> 16:14.515
Got a little morning sickness.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.308
Threw up in Darlene's baby's crib.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.685
It worked out, though.
I just blamed the baby.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.437
Morning sickness?

16:20.521 --> 16:24.775
Wait, why would you have morning sickness?

16:24.858 --> 16:27.236
Oh, that's right.
'Cause you're havin' my boyfriend's baby.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.030
Burn! Up top, Hank.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.614
I don't wanna get involved.

16:30.697 --> 16:31.948
[imitates Hank]
"I don't wanna get involved."

16:32.033 --> 16:33.700
You used to be cool, man.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.537
Hey, Heather.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.416
Colt told me the news.
Anything you need, I'm here for you.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.335
You know, what she needs is
some condoms. [snickers]

16:44.836 --> 16:46.005
[stammering] Oh, I'm...

16:46.088 --> 16:47.839
Yeah, well, I'm kidding.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.675
God.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.262
[scoffs] Oh, shit.
You know what I just realized?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.890
I taught you sex ed.

16:59.976 --> 17:01.353
[blows raspberry]

17:02.313 --> 17:03.439
What?

17:10.737 --> 17:12.531
[auctioneer speaking rapidly]

17:13.490 --> 17:14.491
[Rooster laughing]

17:15.201 --> 17:17.703
Look, they got a typo in the program.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.456
It's supposed to say "black Angus."
Says "black Anus."

17:20.539 --> 17:23.084
-[laughs]
-Shut up.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.673
What you getting a bull for, anyway, huh?
You inseminating?

17:29.756 --> 17:33.969
Yeah, I'm gonna let a bull take a crack
at those heifers that didn't take.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.556
If I can snag one for under six grand,
I'll get my money's worth.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.433
Well, that makes sense.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.393
Hey, look,
if the bull can't get 'em pregnant,

17:41.477 --> 17:43.270
bet you Colt can.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.815
Howdy, fellas.

17:46.898 --> 17:48.400
-[Beau] Hey, Dale.
-What's going on?

17:48.484 --> 17:50.652
Well, don't it smell great in here?

17:50.736 --> 17:53.280
[exhales heavily]
It smells like cow shit, Dale.

17:53.364 --> 17:55.491
Ah, cowboy cologne.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.619
What are you doing way over here?

17:58.702 --> 18:02.206
Oh, they pay a few of us vets
to come over and check the bulls out.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.334
You know, turn your head and cough,
that sort of thing.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.836
-See anything you like?
-[exhales heavily]

18:07.919 --> 18:11.548
Well, the wings in the concession stand,
but I forgot my Tums.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.719
I love spicy, but spicy does not love me.

18:15.802 --> 18:17.346
[laughs]

18:17.429 --> 18:19.515
[auctioneer] Next, we've got lot 12,
bull number 9.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.433
Bidding starts at 2,000.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.726
[crowd murmuring]

18:22.809 --> 18:25.354
[auctioneer speaking rapidly]

18:25.437 --> 18:26.897
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:29.483 --> 18:31.026
May the best rancher win.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.446
[chuckling] Hey. Goodness gracious.
Did y'all see this?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.698
It says "black Anus"!

18:36.782 --> 18:38.325
[both laughing]

18:42.954 --> 18:46.750
Careful, be careful.
Step, step, step, step! [grunts]

18:46.833 --> 18:49.295
-[sighs]
-You want some aspirin?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.462
-Yes.
-Okay.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.838
Ooh, and bread.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.593
You know what's better than bread? Toast.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.470
Well, we're all outta toast.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.347
We should go buy some toast.

19:01.848 --> 19:03.434
You know what we didn't talk about?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.019
You're gonna be a grandma.

19:06.102 --> 19:07.771
-What's that all about?
-Oh.

19:08.772 --> 19:11.817
Oh, God. "Grandma"?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.402
Maybe I'll be "Nana Maggie."

19:13.485 --> 19:15.821
No, that's sounds worse.
Sounds like an old goat.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.199
You know what's worse?

19:18.282 --> 19:20.492
"Stepmom Abby." Ugh.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.287
The new art teacher's a stepmom.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.372
She wears clogs.

19:25.456 --> 19:28.375
[gasps] I will not wear clogs,
Nana Maggie.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.379
Why don't I get you a blanket?

19:32.463 --> 19:34.756
Yeah. Thank you.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.052
Hey, can I smoke in here?

19:39.761 --> 19:43.014
Look, just get some sleep, okay?

19:43.098 --> 19:45.226
Your cigarettes will be right here
in the morning.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.313
Was supposed to be me.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.232
What's that?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.149
It was supposed to be me.

19:54.193 --> 19:58.197
[sighs] Colt's about to have a baby
and it isn't mine.

20:00.031 --> 20:03.034
You know what? I changed my mind.
Bread is better than toast.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.664
All right. Just get some rest, okay?

20:07.748 --> 20:10.292
Now every first he has
is gonna be with someone else.

20:12.168 --> 20:16.590
First kid to call him Daddy won't be mine.
First kid to go to prom won't be mine.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.384
First kid to go to college...

20:18.467 --> 20:23.305
Well, it is Colt and Heather,
so I might have a shot at that one.

20:24.973 --> 20:28.560
Look, your time with Colt will come
and it'll be just as special.

20:29.936 --> 20:33.189
It was easier when I thought
they weren't gonna keep the baby.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.902
That make me a terrible person?

20:37.528 --> 20:41.865
You're a wonderful person
going through a... a tough time.

20:41.948 --> 20:43.575
But you're not gonna go through it alone.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.077
-Okay? Colt's gonna be there for you.
-[sighs]

20:46.161 --> 20:48.580
He's been stepping up big time
on this whole thing.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.291
Just...

20:51.041 --> 20:52.584
talk to each other.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.421
Tell him how you feel...

21:04.179 --> 21:05.180
No, I need it.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.315
-[indistinct chatter]
-You're just doin' this to piss me off.

21:15.231 --> 21:17.359
By "this," you mean buyin' a bull?

21:17.443 --> 21:19.611
Bein' a rancher? Existin'?

21:20.696 --> 21:21.697
Yes.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.076
It occurs to me that, uh,

21:26.159 --> 21:29.455
you taught Rooster everything he knows
about picking a bull.

21:30.038 --> 21:33.417
So it stands to reason
you'd have the same taste.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.670
If you think about it, that's, uh...
that's kinda sweet.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.382
Lift that paddle again,
I'll cut off your hand.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.344
Less sweet.

21:44.135 --> 21:46.096
Stay out of it, Dale.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.890
Nah, maybe I ought to go get
some kettle corn.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.811
You know, 'round here
they call it "cattle corn"? [laughs]

21:52.894 --> 21:54.646
I appreciate that.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.985
You're not even buyin' a bull
for your own ranch.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.904
You're just some hired hand
for some corporation.

22:04.155 --> 22:06.408
You know what? You're right.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.826
This is stupid.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.036
What'd you say you could spend
on a bull, huh? Six thousand?

22:10.120 --> 22:12.288
-Yeah.
-Cool.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.124
Sixty-five hundred.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.709
[auctioneer exclaiming]

22:16.585 --> 22:20.213
Congratulations.
You just overpaid for a bull.

22:20.296 --> 22:21.840
Hope you can ride it home.

22:29.097 --> 22:32.308
Don't worry about a ride home.
I got ya.

22:32.393 --> 22:33.560
Thanks, Dale.

22:33.644 --> 22:38.148
I'll come out later in the week
and give that bull a proper examination.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.611
[exhales sharply] Yeah, about that, uh...

22:44.112 --> 22:46.490
Neumann's Hill won't let me use you.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.700
They said you're not
on their approved list of vets.

22:50.201 --> 22:51.327
Oh.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.373
Well, that's unfortunate, but...

22:56.833 --> 22:58.084
I get it.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.379
Appreciate that.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.841
It's also unfortunate
you'll be walking home.

23:04.925 --> 23:05.967
Bye.

23:14.810 --> 23:15.811
Mom?

23:16.812 --> 23:19.189
What are you doin' here?
I was about to head back down to the bar.

23:19.981 --> 23:22.317
Um... you got a second?

23:24.277 --> 23:26.905
If you came to pick up
some of them frozen steaks you left here

23:26.988 --> 23:29.616
and noticed there were a couple missin',
that was Drake.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.744
On his own. Yeah, he's really smart.
Bad Drake!

23:33.870 --> 23:38.083
Look, Abby's had a full day,
and almost a full keg.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.960
She's passed out on the couch.

23:41.837 --> 23:42.838
What?

23:48.218 --> 23:49.219
Oh.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.555
She'll be fine.
She's got a bread pillow.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.518
I just think everything with her parents

23:56.602 --> 24:00.063
and the baby and you guys
hit her all at once.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.274
Shit.

24:04.192 --> 24:05.527
This is all my fault.

24:08.154 --> 24:10.824
-You waitin' for me to argue with you?
-I just...

24:11.867 --> 24:14.786
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to fix this?

24:15.579 --> 24:18.957
You can't. You're not gonna fix it.
Just be there for her.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.753
[exhales heavily] I'm trying.
It's just... hard.

24:24.129 --> 24:27.633
With work and her parents. Heather.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.928
How the fuck did this become my life?

24:32.012 --> 24:34.055
Well, would you like me
to walk you through it?

24:34.139 --> 24:37.893
'Cause I could draw a diagram with
three stick figures and one little stick.

24:39.352 --> 24:42.397
Look, you've created a messy situation.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.067
But you have a good heart.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.360
All right, Colt?

24:47.443 --> 24:50.989
You just follow that.
Everything's gonna be fine.

24:55.577 --> 24:56.787
[Maggie chuckles]

25:00.541 --> 25:01.875
Thanks, Mom.

25:03.501 --> 25:04.628
Do you smell smoke?

25:04.711 --> 25:07.213
Does Domino's deliver out here?

25:19.142 --> 25:21.562
-[engine stops]
-Oh, my God. I'm never drinking again.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.646
[chuckles]

25:22.729 --> 25:26.107
If I can't uncover my eyes, I'm gonna have
to use one of your windows as a puke bag.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.151
Okay, just don't look until I tell you.

25:28.234 --> 25:29.360
-[sighs]
-All right.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.487
You know the water tower
where Rooster painted "Fuck Colt"?

25:31.572 --> 25:34.407
Yeah, of course.
It's how I give directions to the highway.

25:34.490 --> 25:37.202
Take a left at the "Fuck Colt"
water tower, a right on Mill Road,

25:37.285 --> 25:39.788
and if you hit the "Colt Sucks" barn,
you've gone too far.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.957
[chuckling] Well,
we're at the water tower.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.334
[stammers] The "Colt Sucks" barn
is still there?

25:45.543 --> 25:47.420
Oh, no. No. It's too bright.

25:47.503 --> 25:49.005
-You gotta look at the water tower.
-It's too bright.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.090
-I don't wanna!
-Stop.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.967
I... I'll get you a McGriddle afterwards.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.176
Okay, fine.

25:54.636 --> 25:55.762
[groans]

25:58.807 --> 26:01.017
[chuckles] "Fuck, Colt loves Abby."

26:03.061 --> 26:06.690
Yeah, I didn't have enough paint to cover
up the "Fuck," so I just added to it.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.692
[both chuckle]

26:11.569 --> 26:13.321
This whole situation sucks.

26:14.823 --> 26:18.284
And it also sucks that we live in a town
where everyone's gotta know our business.

26:19.535 --> 26:21.747
-Now at least they'll know this, too.
-[chuckles]

26:22.580 --> 26:24.791
-It's so sweet, Colt.
-[chuckles]

26:24.875 --> 26:26.668
And you even put the comma
in the right spot.

26:26.752 --> 26:30.005
Honestly, that was just a lucky guess.
I didn't... I just...

26:30.088 --> 26:31.464
[chuckles]

26:32.841 --> 26:34.550
-[sighs]
-But I mean it.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.888
I don't want you to forget it.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.933
Well, I'll be reminded about it every day.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.018
[chuckles]

26:43.101 --> 26:45.812
At least until Rooster turns it back
to "Fuck Colt."

26:45.896 --> 26:46.897
[chuckles]

26:49.482 --> 26:50.942
We're gonna make it through this.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.820
I'll be a good father.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.447
I'll be an even better boyfriend.

26:57.615 --> 26:58.950
Okay, that doesn't sound great.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.745
-Right.
-[chuckles]

27:01.828 --> 27:04.330
I... I'll be equally good at both.
How's that?

27:05.581 --> 27:06.917
Fuck, Abby loves Colt.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.089
Ooh. Fuck,
Abby needs to brush her teeth.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.716
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

27:17.803 --> 27:19.721
[upbeat music playing]
