00:04.618 --> 00:06.385
Hi, I'm Gabi Diamond,

00:06.420 --> 00:08.454
I'm here to interview for
the private chef position.

00:08.489 --> 00:09.783
Hopefully, he can see me right away

00:09.784 --> 00:11.983
because I only had enough
money to Park for 12 minutes.

00:12.192 --> 00:15.127
Then you need to hustle, honey,
'cause you can't use the front door.

00:15.162 --> 00:16.771
You need to use the service entrance.

00:16.772 --> 00:18.110
Where is that...

00:24.438 --> 00:25.572
Please tell me this is
the service entrance.

00:25.606 --> 00:27.507
It's right down the hall
next to the trash chute.

00:27.541 --> 00:29.309
- Okay.
- Uh...

00:29.343 --> 00:31.344
And as long as you're going that way.

00:35.382 --> 00:37.116
(Panting)

00:37.151 --> 00:38.151
Is this it?

00:38.185 --> 00:39.919
'Cause I'm down to 11 minutes.

00:41.155 --> 00:44.799
You found it. Follow me. (Laughs)

00:47.061 --> 00:48.595
(Gasping)

00:48.629 --> 00:50.597
Wow, this place is amazing!

00:50.631 --> 00:52.599
Look at the Golden Gate Bridge!

00:52.633 --> 00:55.810
You're so close you can make eye
contact with the people stuck in traffic.

00:57.404 --> 00:59.239
You're almost home!

01:01.275 --> 01:03.309
Oh, hi, we're just finishing up here.

01:03.344 --> 01:05.044
So, shh!

01:05.078 --> 01:07.180
Oh, okay, I'll just be over here.

01:07.214 --> 01:08.214
I won't say another word.

01:08.249 --> 01:10.848
- Now, Mr. Voltaggio...
- Oh, my God!

01:12.052 --> 01:13.987
Chef Michael Voltaggio?!

01:14.021 --> 01:16.055
- I am such a huge fan.
- Thanks.

01:16.090 --> 01:17.690
You know he won "Top Chef", right?

01:17.725 --> 01:22.729
Personally, I think he could win
"America's Next Top Model Chef."

01:22.763 --> 01:25.832
- I'd audition for that show.
- And bring home a trophy!

01:27.668 --> 01:29.502
What are you doing here?

01:29.536 --> 01:31.304
Just, uh, interviewing for the chef job.

01:31.338 --> 01:32.338
Oh!

01:32.373 --> 01:33.539
Uh-oh.

01:33.574 --> 01:36.142
Thanks for coming in, Michael.

01:36.176 --> 01:38.311
You'll be hearing from us very soon.

01:38.345 --> 01:40.046
Possibly on the way to your car.

01:43.117 --> 01:45.084
Well, as you can see,
the position's filled.

01:45.119 --> 01:46.953
So, buh-bye.

01:46.987 --> 01:49.088
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay.

01:49.123 --> 01:52.792
So I didn't win "Top Chef,"
and I don't have any awards.

01:52.826 --> 01:54.484
Heck, I don't even have a boyfriend.

01:55.629 --> 01:57.530
But you know what I do have?

01:57.564 --> 01:59.832
Lots and lots of debt.

02:01.568 --> 02:05.571
Which means I'll be available
to cook for your boss 24/7.

02:05.606 --> 02:09.342
- By the way, I'm Gabi.
- Yes, you are.

02:09.376 --> 02:11.411
And you are Elliot Park.

02:11.445 --> 02:14.447
Mr. Kaminski's publicist,
slash right-hand man, slash

02:14.481 --> 02:16.983
how lucky is he to have you?

02:17.017 --> 02:19.252
Congratulations, you can Google.

02:21.955 --> 02:23.089
Is that a sub-zero?

02:23.123 --> 02:24.724
(Gasping)

02:24.758 --> 02:26.726
Oh, last time I saw
this much stainless steel

02:26.760 --> 02:29.095
I was getting a pap smear.

02:29.129 --> 02:31.597
Hey, everybody, I'm home.

02:34.702 --> 02:36.602
Josh, you look fantastic.

02:36.637 --> 02:38.771
Who travels 10 hours and looks this good?

02:38.806 --> 02:40.406
Ha-ha, you!

02:41.542 --> 02:45.378
- How was your trip?
- Ah, China was awesome.

02:45.412 --> 02:47.380
Only problem is you open a business there,

02:47.414 --> 02:49.215
an hour later you want
to open up another one.

02:49.249 --> 02:51.217
(Laughing)

02:51.251 --> 02:52.985
(Exaggerated laughter)

02:53.020 --> 02:54.187
- Elliot.
- Okay.

02:54.221 --> 02:57.824
Ah, wait until you see what I bought.

02:57.858 --> 03:00.026
It's a ring for Caroline.

03:00.060 --> 03:01.060
(Gasping)

03:01.095 --> 03:02.028
Check it out.

03:02.062 --> 03:05.798
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.
- Isn't it? Elliot, who's this?

03:05.833 --> 03:08.966
Uh, hopefully your new chef if I'm lucky.

03:09.803 --> 03:13.506
We're hiring a real chef, one
with credentials and awards...

03:13.540 --> 03:14.762
And tattoos.

03:15.476 --> 03:17.477
Well, where is he, 'cause I'm starving.

03:17.511 --> 03:19.312
Uh, well, I can make you something.

03:19.346 --> 03:21.487
You're not the chef!
She's not the chef!

03:23.183 --> 03:26.152
But I am here, and I know
exactly what you want to eat.

03:26.186 --> 03:28.154
Because I am a food mind reader.

03:28.188 --> 03:30.089
It's one of my superpowers.

03:30.124 --> 03:31.769
So is driving without insurance.

03:37.197 --> 03:38.898
Grilled Cheese?!

03:40.934 --> 03:43.903
This looks... fantastic.

03:46.473 --> 03:48.841
- Mmm.
- (Chair hissing)

03:48.876 --> 03:50.676
It's so Ooey-Gooey.

03:50.711 --> 03:52.412
You know what?

03:52.446 --> 03:53.875
Forget the other guy, you're hired.

03:53.876 --> 03:55.325
<i>- (Squealing)
- Elliot: What?!</i>

03:57.584 --> 04:01.020
What... for making Grilled Cheese?!

04:01.054 --> 04:04.056
It doesn't count if the name
of the food is the recipe.

04:05.926 --> 04:07.193
I'm going with my gut on this one.

04:07.227 --> 04:08.574
And my gut is loving it.

04:08.575 --> 04:09.508
(Sighing)

04:09.509 --> 04:12.098
But your gut hasn't met Michael Voltaggio.

04:14.635 --> 04:16.803
At least have her make a trial dinner!

04:18.639 --> 04:21.406
That's fine, I'm not afraid of a trial.

04:21.442 --> 04:26.412
'Cause I'm innocent and my
food will be proven delish.

04:26.447 --> 04:27.613
So, what do you want me to make?

04:27.648 --> 04:30.383
Well, I'm proposing to
my girlfriend on Friday,

04:30.417 --> 04:31.784
and everything's gotta be amazing.

04:31.819 --> 04:33.453
Like her.

04:33.487 --> 04:35.713
She's cultured and gorgeous
and way out of my league.

04:36.857 --> 04:39.349
Can you make a dinner
that'll make her say yes?

04:39.350 --> 04:41.380
Oh, I'm gonna do better than that.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.051
I'm gonna make her say, "Yes! Yes! Yes!"

(Gasping)

05:00.581 --> 05:01.647
Six bags of groceries.

05:01.682 --> 05:05.551
You either got the job, or did
you finally clean out your car?

05:05.586 --> 05:07.420
No, I got it...

05:07.454 --> 05:09.388
In an almost-y kind of way.

05:09.423 --> 05:12.758
I just have to make a trial dinner
and if that goes well, I get the job!

05:12.793 --> 05:14.627
And if that goes well, I get promoted!

05:14.661 --> 05:16.429
(Shrieking)

05:16.463 --> 05:18.369
Wait, what?

05:18.370 --> 05:22.096
If I bring Josh Kaminski and
his rich friends in as clients

05:22.097 --> 05:23.869
to Garber, Stukenbaker
and Rizz... (Gasping)

05:23.870 --> 05:27.663
They'll change the name to Garber,
Stukenbaker, Rizz... and Rodriguez.

05:29.576 --> 05:33.412
Well, he's going to propose to his
high-society girlfriend during the meal

05:33.447 --> 05:35.615
and my food has to make her wanna say yes.

05:35.649 --> 05:38.451
I mean, Sofia, what if I screw this up?

05:38.485 --> 05:39.719
Uh, stop that.

05:39.753 --> 05:42.688
You've got to be confident,
okay, like I am at work.

05:42.723 --> 05:44.423
When I deal with the partners,

05:44.458 --> 05:45.825
I don't second-guess myself.

05:45.859 --> 05:47.693
I march right into a meeting.

05:47.728 --> 05:50.596
I look 'em straight in the eye, and I say,

05:50.631 --> 05:52.306
"here's your coffee."

05:54.434 --> 05:56.602
And nobody has to tell
me how they want it, no!

05:56.637 --> 05:58.771
Gary wants cream,
Shirley wants sugar and...

05:58.805 --> 06:01.774
Bob wants to stare at my boobs.

06:01.808 --> 06:03.882
Confidence, boom!

06:04.611 --> 06:06.412
Yeah... yeah!

06:06.446 --> 06:09.482
In the kitchen, I have it together.

06:09.516 --> 06:12.785
And Mr. Kaminski knows that
because look what he gave me.

06:12.819 --> 06:16.489
Uh... a Black Amex?

06:16.523 --> 06:18.624
(Sighing)

06:18.659 --> 06:21.827

The backup meal for tonight,
compliments of our future chef

06:41.348 --> 06:43.372
Michael Voltaggio.

06:44.351 --> 06:46.385
You do not need a backup.

06:46.420 --> 06:47.520
(Sniffing)

06:47.554 --> 06:48.886
That smells really good.

06:50.257 --> 06:53.326
No, you know what, it
doesn't matter because...

06:53.360 --> 06:55.027
Boom!

06:55.062 --> 06:57.598
Bravo, you set a table.

06:59.032 --> 07:02.101
And made Cornish Game Hen
with Gorgonzola Caramelized Pears,

07:02.135 --> 07:07.006
and Truffle Mashed Potatoes,
and a big side dish of bite me.

07:09.876 --> 07:12.478
Both: Oh, my God, you look so handsome!

07:15.415 --> 07:17.483
I mean really, really handsome.

07:17.517 --> 07:18.484
Like a God.

07:18.518 --> 07:19.485
Oh, Elliot.

07:19.519 --> 07:21.654
(Chuckling)

07:21.688 --> 07:24.223
This is my lucky suit.

07:24.257 --> 07:26.392
I have closed seven
huge deals in this suit.

07:26.426 --> 07:28.160
Hopefully, tonight will be number eight.

07:28.195 --> 07:30.029
But just in case things
aren't going my way,

07:30.063 --> 07:31.130
I designed this rabbit
foot app for my phone.

07:31.164 --> 07:34.100
You just kind of rub it.

07:34.134 --> 07:35.167
You don't need that app when you have

07:35.202 --> 07:37.870
all these apps-etizers!

07:37.938 --> 07:38.938
Ta-da!

07:41.008 --> 07:42.108

07:42.142 --> 07:45.745

I mean, this night is going
to knock Caroline's socks off.

08:21.682 --> 08:22.815
If she wore socks.

08:22.849 --> 08:25.718
She doesn't wear socks,
she has awesome legs.

08:25.752 --> 08:27.653
She has awesome everything.

08:27.688 --> 08:29.388
Do you wanna know the most
awesome thing about Caroline?

08:29.423 --> 08:31.524
- What?
- She loves me.

08:31.558 --> 08:32.625
And why wouldn't she?

08:32.659 --> 08:36.261
I was always focused on
work... till I met her.

08:36.296 --> 08:37.429
Now I hardly ever think about developing

08:37.464 --> 08:41.100
Rich Media Solutions in
Flash and Javascript anymore.

08:41.134 --> 08:43.335
Yeah, I hardly ever
think about that either.

08:43.370 --> 08:44.937
(Phone ringing)

08:44.971 --> 08:47.173
Ooh, that's her, ain't she pretty?

08:47.207 --> 08:49.108
Hey, baby, are you close?

08:50.911 --> 08:53.045
I can't really hear you,
you're breaking up, hold on.

08:57.784 --> 08:58.818
Hey, Sofia.

08:58.852 --> 09:00.453
So far, it's going really great.

09:00.487 --> 09:03.723
He likes the way it looks,
the music I picked, my singing.

09:03.757 --> 09:08.527
No matter what happens,
you are a female warrior.

09:08.562 --> 09:11.892
And it's kill or be killed and
you have to come out on top.

09:13.366 --> 09:16.455
Um, are you watching "Hunger Games" again?

09:17.337 --> 09:21.378
You don't watch "Hunger
Games," you study it.

09:21.975 --> 09:23.042
Okay.

09:28.014 --> 09:31.584
I don't think she's gonna be
getting here when we expected.

09:31.618 --> 09:32.685
Oh, well, that's all right.

09:32.719 --> 09:34.787
I can keep this warm for an hour.

09:34.821 --> 09:37.723
You'll have to keep it warm
a little longer than that.

09:37.758 --> 09:40.392
Caroline wants to take a break.

09:40.427 --> 09:41.761
Um...

09:41.795 --> 09:45.297
Something about moving too
fast and not being in control.

09:45.332 --> 09:46.432
It's kind of hard to
remember her exact words

09:46.466 --> 09:48.434
when your life is
crumbling in front of you.

09:48.468 --> 09:51.470
Oh, Josh, I am so sorry.

09:51.505 --> 09:54.373
I'm sorry, Gabi, this dinner's a bust.

since he lost his "Star
Wars" poster in a poker game.

10:12.364 --> 10:14.431
I had pocket aces, I had to go all in.

10:17.068 --> 10:21.071
On the bright side, your
trial dinner is a disaster.

10:22.207 --> 10:24.808
Which means you're out, Voltaggio's in.

10:24.843 --> 10:26.777
But that's not fair.

10:26.811 --> 10:29.713
No one has it harder
than a pretty blonde girl.

10:32.684 --> 10:34.017
Every time Josh sees you,

10:34.052 --> 10:37.888
he's going to be reminded of
the worst night of his life.

10:37.922 --> 10:39.556
Yay!

10:42.694 --> 10:44.495
Yolanda, you gotta help me out here.

10:44.529 --> 10:45.696
I really need this job.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.197
Oh, you got it.

10:47.232 --> 10:48.374
Now, listen, honey,

10:48.375 --> 10:51.483
when my son was heartbroken,
I sat him down and I told him...

10:51.484 --> 10:53.419
Ooh, it's 8:00, gotta bounce.

11:02.981 --> 11:04.815
Josh?

11:10.622 --> 11:13.590
- Josh?
- Ow!

11:13.625 --> 11:15.859
This hurts so bad!

11:15.894 --> 11:19.496
It actually physically hurts.

11:19.531 --> 11:21.498
I know, I'm really sorry.

11:21.533 --> 11:23.333
Josh, come on.

11:23.368 --> 11:27.271
You're smart, you're
charming, you're successful.

11:27.305 --> 11:30.507
- You got killer hair.
- I do have killer hair.

11:30.542 --> 11:33.110
Let's drink to that.

11:33.144 --> 11:34.211
Okay.

11:34.245 --> 11:37.314
Oh, there's the engagement ring.

11:37.348 --> 11:41.051
Wow, it looks even bigger wet.

11:41.085 --> 11:43.821
I can't believe it's over.

11:43.855 --> 11:45.155
I just feel so empty.

11:47.859 --> 11:50.661
That's because you're hungry.

11:50.695 --> 11:51.695
I'm going to fix you a plate.

11:51.729 --> 11:55.599
And I know exactly what you like.

11:55.633 --> 11:57.601
Nothing's gonna make me feel better.

11:57.635 --> 11:58.802
Not even... Mashed Potatoes?

11:58.837 --> 12:01.472
Mashed Potatoes?

12:01.506 --> 12:02.573
With lots of Cream and Butter.

12:02.607 --> 12:05.375
I like Cream and Butter.

12:05.410 --> 12:08.545
Oh, my God, that's so good.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.247
- Mmm.
- (Sighing)

12:13.318 --> 12:15.185
You're not going to make
me eat alone, are you?

12:17.455 --> 12:19.890
Well, it's kind of unprofessional.

12:19.924 --> 12:21.959
But I hear the food here is really good.

12:23.928 --> 12:26.063
<i>To Mashed Potatoes.</i>

12:26.097 --> 12:28.932
And to my favorite kind
of champagne... free.

12:31.636 --> 12:33.737
You know what?

12:33.771 --> 12:35.539
This meal kicked ass.

12:35.573 --> 12:36.573
It really cheered me up.

12:36.608 --> 12:37.774
Well, I knew it would.

12:37.809 --> 12:39.710
When my mom died, I used to
make special meals for my dad

12:39.744 --> 12:41.445
all the time, and it always cheered him up.

12:41.479 --> 12:42.613
Aw...

12:42.647 --> 12:44.348
I bet you miss your mom.

12:44.382 --> 12:46.149
That must be nice.

12:46.184 --> 12:50.053
I see mine every single day.

12:50.088 --> 12:52.022
Well, my mom was the best.

12:52.056 --> 12:55.292
She taught me to cook, and we
watched Julia Child together.

12:55.326 --> 12:56.293
I love Julia Child.

12:56.327 --> 12:57.961
- Really?!
- Yeah.

12:57.996 --> 12:59.096
I studied her in a business class.

12:59.130 --> 13:00.264
I mean, think about it.

13:00.298 --> 13:03.834
She took her passion and
turned it into an industry.

13:03.868 --> 13:05.903
You know who else was full of passion?

13:05.937 --> 13:07.638
- Caroline.
- Shh, Potatoes.

13:07.672 --> 13:08.605
Mmm.

13:09.874 --> 13:11.875
Yeah, Julia Child was my inspiration.

13:11.910 --> 13:15.579
Whenever I'm in a predicament,
I ask, "what would Julia do?"

13:15.613 --> 13:16.547
That's why I dropped out of college.

13:16.581 --> 13:17.614
- Really?
- Um-hm.

13:17.649 --> 13:21.552
I dropped out of college when I sold
my first company for $3.6 million.

13:21.586 --> 13:24.388
Wow, we're so alike!

13:24.422 --> 13:28.125
We both dropped out of college,
we're both entrepreneurs...

13:28.159 --> 13:32.296
Except you're in fortune 500,
and to me, 500 is a fortune.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.263
(Chuckling)

13:33.298 --> 13:34.898
It's a play on words.

13:34.933 --> 13:36.967
I'm drunk.

13:37.001 --> 13:39.036
Well, you made an amazing dinner.

13:39.070 --> 13:40.003
Well, it's not over yet.

13:40.038 --> 13:41.939
Wait till you see dessert.
