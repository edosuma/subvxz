WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.337
Previously on Scorpion...
I'm sorry. Who are you?

00:03.371 --> 00:04.805
I'm Patty,
Alderman Dodd's intern.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.574
I'd left extra shortbreads
for your team,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.709
but they were such a hit,
I need all of them

00:08.742 --> 00:10.711
to grease the wheels
of the government.

00:10.744 --> 00:14.248
Your loss, Doc.
They were scrumptious.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.150
Ralph doesn't like shortbread.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.618
CABE:
Yeah, but he sure likes her.

00:17.651 --> 00:21.189
Agent Gallo, you're under arrest
for instigating an escape.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.356
(handcuffs tighten)
I want a lawyer.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.557
You put Scorpion
up as collateral?

00:23.591 --> 00:24.725
The garage, everything?

00:24.758 --> 00:26.727
It was either that or
leave you in prison.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.831
TOBY:
So, counselor,

00:30.864 --> 00:32.200
you've reviewed
Agent Gallo's case.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.601
How would you approach
his defense?

00:33.634 --> 00:36.170
This case isn't
about Agent Gallo.

00:36.204 --> 00:40.108
It's about sticking it
to the government.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.642
SYLVESTER:
So...

00:41.675 --> 00:43.344
thank you for coming in.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.612
You had an offer
for three years?

00:44.645 --> 00:45.746
Oh.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.848
Well, you should've taken that.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.584
Trials are stressful.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.356
LAWYER:
No injuries at all?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.558
All that ice,
never slipped once?

00:57.591 --> 01:00.728
Norwegian government's
got deep pockets.

01:00.761 --> 01:04.532
You know, it's been many years
since I tried any cases,

01:04.565 --> 01:06.767
but I'm confident
I could try this one and win.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.203
And the price is certainly right.
(phone beeps)

01:09.237 --> 01:11.105
Oh, uh, sorry, got a ride.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.640
No, don't go. We're
just getting started.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.308
We'll get you home,
no problem.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.477
Oh, you don't understand.
I drive for a rideshare.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.213
And there's no way I'm
giving up an airport run.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.416
(door opens)

01:22.450 --> 01:23.584
LAWYER 2:
I don't care.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.452
We don't plea.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.854
My client's not doing
a day in prison.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.222
(mouths):
Sorry.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.658
It's walk or nothing.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.227
Call me when you're ready
to drop the charges.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.663
(sighs) My apologies,
gentlemen, I'm...

01:37.531 --> 01:39.500
Oh. Oh, you can't afford me.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.734
SYLVESTER:
Well,

01:40.768 --> 01:42.503
that's two weeks down the tubes.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.605
Nothing to show
for a lawyer for Cabe.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.240
(door closes)
We need a great one

01:46.274 --> 01:47.841
if we're going to prove
that Cabe isn't responsible

01:47.875 --> 01:49.343
for Collins escaping.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.179
None of these jokers
get what's at stake.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.646
No one cares like we do.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.415
I care... about
getting things done.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.350
Hey, Patty.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.851
We have business.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.253
My office?

02:00.521 --> 02:01.322
"Her office"?

02:01.355 --> 02:02.756
I better go.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.225
She angers easily.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.227
CABE: Guys, we're gonna
find a lawyer.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.496
If you stay positive,
stay present,

02:08.529 --> 02:09.730
the future will
take care of itself.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.832
Which could be 25
in Leavenworth.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.769
That wasn't positive. Oh!
(door opens)

02:15.803 --> 02:18.472
Here is some positivity.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.741
We're gonna get churros
from L.A. Churro Fest.

02:20.774 --> 02:21.409
We can't afford them.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.744
You went to Churro Fest 2017,

02:23.777 --> 02:25.746
didn't get a single
deep-fried treat?

02:25.779 --> 02:26.780
RALPH: Well,
we did buy a single one.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.282
We went foursies on it.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.783
PAIGE:
Yep.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.620
We've been going foursies
on a lot of things lately.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.222
Diagnostics on the 3-D printing
are almost done.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.689
We are good to go
on the Air Force gig.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.890
Let's pack up.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.264
(chuckles softly)

02:43.297 --> 02:45.599
At least we had
a-a nice little date

02:45.633 --> 02:46.900
before the daily grind.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.669
Mm.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.637
You disagree?

02:49.670 --> 02:52.806
We may define the word
"date" differently.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.308
I see it as the two of us,

02:54.342 --> 02:55.776
a restaurant,
a bottle of wine...

02:55.809 --> 02:56.710
I see it as that, too.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.879
But if the recent past
is any indicator,

02:58.912 --> 03:00.581
Happy would be
at the table with us.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.782
Well...

03:01.815 --> 03:02.983
not necessarily.
Really?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.219
'Cause last week, she came
with us to the science museum;

03:05.253 --> 03:06.720
Saturday, the arboretum;

03:06.754 --> 03:08.889
last night she watched Fletch
with us in the garage,

03:08.922 --> 03:11.792
after everyone else left.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.861
Well, I-I guess
we're just, uh, fun.

03:13.894 --> 03:18.632
Yeah. I guess I-I'm confused why
she's third-wheeling so much,

03:18.666 --> 03:21.469
and where I'm
really lost is why

03:21.502 --> 03:22.970
you're okay with it.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.906
Mm, I don't know. I... just am.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.375
I'm gonna talk to her about it.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.242
Oh, no. Bad idea.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.977
Well, I'll speak to her
adult to adult.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.345
I know her.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.713
She won't react well.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.885
Okay, see, now you're protecting
her feelings over mine.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.020
Do you not...
do you not see this?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.756
I see that now.

03:44.292 --> 03:47.461
We'll discuss it. Later.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.833
SYLVESTER: I've been pouring
over the statutes

03:52.866 --> 03:53.934
for community
program funding,

03:53.967 --> 03:56.804
after-school program funding.
I even did a search

03:56.837 --> 03:58.872
for subterranean windowless
space program funding.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.408
Doesn't exist.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.276
I was joking.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.544
It's unbecoming. Continue.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.745
We should be
able to draw

04:04.778 --> 04:06.747
from four different earmarks

04:06.780 --> 04:09.783
in order to attain
our $6,000 science club budget.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.785
This may hold up.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.921
I'll submit to the board
after school.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.457
Speaking of which,
I've never had a tardy before,

04:16.490 --> 04:17.991
and I'm not starting now.
And you're not starting now.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.527
Can you at least admit
that you're impressed

04:19.560 --> 04:20.761
that I'm progressing
as a politician?

04:20.794 --> 04:23.764
I'll be impressed
when we're fumigating.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.866
(sighs)

04:26.867 --> 04:27.768
Hey, Patty.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.770
Yep.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.775
Really don't like
this development.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.043
PAIGE:
Happy.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.946
You have a moment to talk? Yeah.
About the drive-in tonight?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.481
I was thinking we should
bring our own snacks,

04:40.514 --> 04:41.949
considering our finances.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.320
We've been having a lot
of fun lately, haven't we?

04:46.354 --> 04:47.955
Yeah, it's been all right.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.324
So, maybe, tonight,
you can take a rain check,

04:50.358 --> 04:54.395
and Walt and I just go
to the drive-in alone.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.630
Huh?
We've been doing

04:56.664 --> 04:58.332
a lot of activities together
these past few weeks.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.633
Right.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.001
It's just for one night.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.571
I mean, Walt and I
just started dating,

05:03.604 --> 05:05.706
so alone time
is important.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.076
Sure. I-I'm good.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.944
Enjoy the movie.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.613
We-we can still do
the Farmer's Market on Saturday.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.781
Can't. My schedule's full.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.015
Happy, come on.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.917
We are good to go,
we can hit the road!

05:16.950 --> 05:18.318
If I'm still invited.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.954
Long drive to the jobsite.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.122
Saddle up.
(drill whirrs)

05:22.155 --> 05:23.957
Just-- don't say it.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.026
Nothing to say.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.429
(quietly):
Except for "I told you so."

05:42.876 --> 05:43.911
Look at over there.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.078
It's the spot.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.815
(bird caws)

05:47.848 --> 05:49.883
(SUV doors opening, closing)

05:49.917 --> 05:52.820
Just being in proximity to one
of these things creeps me out.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.887
Team Scorpion?

05:53.921 --> 05:55.623
In the flesh.

05:55.656 --> 05:56.557
Airman Jay Pendergraft.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.826
Welcome to nuclear missile silo
B21-240J.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.494
Pretty name.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.895
HAPPY: Uh, let's
get rolling.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.897
A few on our team
have a movie to catch.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.365
PENDERGRAFT:
This way.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.136
Save you, Agent Gallo.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.039
Word from base is you're under
suspension from Homeland.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.140
SYLVESTER:
That's correct,

06:13.173 --> 06:14.575
but according to federal law,

06:14.608 --> 06:16.444
government employees
on suspension

06:16.477 --> 06:19.012
can take freelance work
from other government agencies,

06:19.046 --> 06:21.715
provided they don't
have any felony convictions.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.752
Scorpion are freelance
contractors.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.587
Mr. Gallo is an employee
of Scorpion.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.088
He's our intern.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.757
PAIGE: And a
necessary team member.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.659
Without him, we leave.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.993
I'll run it by base.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.464
Intern?
Mm-hmm.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.631
Even made you a badge.

06:37.665 --> 06:38.966
(pats back)

06:42.102 --> 06:44.605
"Junior Intern."

06:44.638 --> 06:46.640
That's great.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.109
(elevator rattling)

06:49.142 --> 06:51.211
PENDERGRAFT: Base described
your job here as twofold:

06:51.244 --> 06:53.781
inspect the Boreas 3 and replace
all corroded hardware

06:53.814 --> 06:55.483
with new 3-D printed
replacements.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.217
And upgrade the launch software.
PAIGE: It sounds like

06:57.250 --> 06:58.118
we're prepping it for war.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.219
I thought they were
being decommissioned.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.489
Well, we have to make sure
that they're physically

07:01.522 --> 07:03.857
and internally stable
before they're shut down.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.793
Or they don't shut down
properly.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.461
And go kaboomski.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.062
A terrifying thought.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.964
(elevator rattles)
Just like this elevator.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.733
It seems very old.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.937
Everything was new here
in 1980.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.939
Most of the companies that built
the missile and the silo

07:18.972 --> 07:19.940
are long out of business,

07:19.973 --> 07:22.142
or we'd be ordering
replacement parts from them

07:22.175 --> 07:24.211
instead of having you
print them up.

07:24.244 --> 07:27.014
1980, I was 22 years old.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.916
I was negative 17.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.820
My God.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.124
Team Scorpion, Airman Jacobs.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.992
Airman, Cabe Gallo.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.129
Geez. 60 megatons
of nuclear destruction

07:42.162 --> 07:45.132
controlled by a computer
with less power than a Pac-Man.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.099
Just two of you on call?

07:46.133 --> 07:48.802
It doesn't take much
to babysit this dinosaur.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.071
All right, Happy, Sly and I
will head to the missile

07:51.104 --> 07:52.039
and begin the software update.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.974
The first step
is to access

07:54.007 --> 07:54.842
the warhead firmware panel,

07:54.875 --> 07:56.577
and then, create
a link from the missile

07:56.610 --> 07:57.878
to our computers in here,

07:57.911 --> 07:59.780
then, begin uploading
the new software.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.915
Any corroded parts we find--
screws, latches--

08:01.949 --> 08:03.183
in the firmware
panel itself,

08:03.216 --> 08:05.719
we'll call in specs to Paige,
Toby and Cabe to begin printing.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.621
WALTER:
Okay, let's move out.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.122
Airman, can you show us
the way, please?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.125
You might need to run out
and get us some lattes.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.193
You know,
being the intern and all.

08:13.226 --> 08:17.064
You ever had your butt
kicked by a junior intern?

08:18.832 --> 08:19.967
(exhales)

08:20.000 --> 08:21.735
Once.

08:34.682 --> 08:35.983
SYLVESTER:
Oof.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.084
That's a lot of missile.

08:37.117 --> 08:37.985
PAIGE:
Just keep your eyes

08:38.018 --> 08:39.119
in front of you, Sly.
You'll be fine.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.722
HAPPY: Thank you, Paige.
No more distractions, please.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.192
Okay, make sure it's flush

08:45.225 --> 08:46.727
to prevent anything
from falling in-between

08:46.760 --> 08:47.895
the walkway and the fuselage.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.630
WALTER:
Yeah, copy that.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.034
(clicking)

08:54.067 --> 08:55.068
WALTER: Once you're
into the panel,

08:55.102 --> 08:57.004
it won't take
long to patch in

08:57.037 --> 08:59.573
and relay to the control center.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.774
TOBY:
Understood.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.910
Aye, aye. Waiting.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.745
Already bored.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.715
Your tours are just
72 hours of this?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.116
Yeah. And this is exciting.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.851
(clicks)

09:10.884 --> 09:12.185
Rusted bolt snapped.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.987
Got to replace it. Sly?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.188
Half-inch bolt diameter.

09:15.222 --> 09:15.856
Shouldn't he use a caliper?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.091
SYLVESTER:
No. I got it.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.164
CABE:
It's starting to print now.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.133
TOBY: So what, just like,
day shift, night shift,

09:26.166 --> 09:27.100
day shift, night shift,

09:27.134 --> 09:29.036
day shift...

09:29.069 --> 09:30.170
And night shift again. Yes.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.206
It's like that song, uh,
"Nightshift" by the Commodores.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.074
Commodores?

09:34.107 --> 09:36.109
Were any of the members
Naval officers?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.111
Oh, guys. Come on.
You don't know the Commodores?

09:41.048 --> 09:44.251
Well, prepare to have your minds
musically blown.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.886
HAPPY:
You want to know

09:45.919 --> 09:47.855
what I think of
when I think of the Commodores?

09:47.888 --> 09:50.057
Harmonious interaction.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.125
Horns, vocals,

09:52.159 --> 09:54.762
drums, bass, guitars,
all working together.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.229
Tight-knit group.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.665
Worked out great.

09:57.698 --> 09:58.832
PAIGE:
Actually, there have been

09:58.866 --> 10:00.167
many members of the Commodores.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.669
Probably because
some of them got sick

10:01.702 --> 10:04.271
of the others
always hanging around.

10:05.839 --> 10:09.042
Paige, I need to swap out
for a one-inch wrench.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.144
Is it okay if Walter
passes that to me,

10:11.178 --> 10:13.881
or is that too intrusive?

10:13.914 --> 10:15.916
Guys, can we save this
till later, please?

10:15.949 --> 10:19.252
And also,
comms off for five minutes

10:19.286 --> 10:20.788
while everyone cools down.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.355
My pleasure.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.227
For the record, she's the one
who's being ridiculous.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.813
(alarm blaring)

10:48.849 --> 10:50.884
Uh, rocket fuel leak. Extremely not good.
We got to get the hell

10:50.918 --> 10:52.686
out of this silo--
the fumes are gonna kill us all.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.054
WALTER:
Grab the gear.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.356
(alarm continues blaring)

10:56.389 --> 10:59.192
(straining)

10:59.226 --> 11:00.728
What the hell?
The door's locked!

11:00.761 --> 11:02.195
WALTER:
Oh, the comms are off.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.131
They can't hear us.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.166
How can they not hear the alarm?

11:06.199 --> 11:08.702
(singing along):

11:15.909 --> 11:17.911
Don't listen to him,
he's not full-time.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.294
Walter, what's going on?

11:34.327 --> 11:36.263
Guys, open the door now!
Why would they seal?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.365
Fuel pressure's bottoming out.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.399
Okay, I dropped the wrench

11:39.432 --> 11:41.301
and punctured the tank,
and now it's leaking fuel.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.737
Somebody get us out of here
before the vapor kills us

11:43.771 --> 11:45.072
or the fuel's ignited!

11:45.105 --> 11:46.740
The slightest spark
could do that.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.841
Working on the door override.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.310
Well, you better
work faster, kid,

11:50.343 --> 11:52.880
unless you have protocol
for a fuel tank eruption.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.247
Uh, no, we don't.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.016
It's open.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.118
(Walter grunts)

11:59.286 --> 12:00.353
If the fuel tank blows,

12:00.387 --> 12:01.354
does that mean
the warhead blows, too?

12:01.388 --> 12:04.224
We don't know.
This has never happened before.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.797

12:17.570 --> 12:20.007
Okay, I screwed us up,
so I will unscrew us.

12:20.040 --> 12:20.841
I don't understand how
a simple wrench

12:20.874 --> 12:22.876
punches a hole
in a nuclear weapon.

12:22.910 --> 12:23.777
They're made
light and thin

12:23.811 --> 12:25.078
so they fly faster,
and it's ancient,

12:25.112 --> 12:26.146
so it's degraded.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.214
I'm running some
quick calculations

12:27.247 --> 12:29.917
based on the proximity
to small towns and cities.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.952
If this warhead goes off,
it's millions dead?

12:31.985 --> 12:33.120
That's where it begins.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.321
Okay, Air Force are
on their way

12:34.354 --> 12:35.322
with a fuel team to handle

12:35.355 --> 12:36.824
the leak and vapor issue.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.158
ETA?
Four hours.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.492
We'll be dead well before then.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.228
Uh, hey, you got eggs
in that fridge?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.430
Um, yeah.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.832
She's going somewhere with this.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.267
I think.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.401
Why is help
four hours away?

12:48.435 --> 12:49.536
Well, an old rust pit like this

12:49.569 --> 12:52.005
isn't exactly high on the
Air Force's priority list.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.974
PAIGE: Well, what if the
fuel tank just empties?

12:54.007 --> 12:54.942
If we're careful about sparks,

12:54.975 --> 12:56.476
it won't just blow up, right?
HAPPY: Wrong.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.378
This is your,
uh, fuel tank emptying.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.080
Uh, which is bad.
What's worse is

13:00.113 --> 13:01.882
the oxidizer tank
on top of it.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.884
The more fuel that
leaves the bottom tank,

13:03.917 --> 13:04.852
the more its integrity
is compromised,

13:04.885 --> 13:06.386
and eventually,
it won't be able to support

13:06.419 --> 13:08.555
the oxidizer on top, and...

13:08.588 --> 13:11.058
Death omelet.
Make sure to wash your hands.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.094
So drain the oxidizer, too.

13:14.127 --> 13:14.794
The nitro tetroxide will ignite

13:14.828 --> 13:16.096
the second it hits those vapors.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.430
Okay, but this control center
is meant

13:17.464 --> 13:18.365
to withstand a rocket launch.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.366
I mean, it can handle
a fuel explosion.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.469
Let's disarm the warhead
and just ride it out.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.537
No. Accessing the detonation
system with our metal tools

13:24.571 --> 13:26.473
could cause a spark
and ignite the fumes.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.574
We'd only need a wrench.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.176
We can make a polymer one

13:29.209 --> 13:30.277
from the 3-D printer--
it's sparkless.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.545
In a perfect world,
but those tanks will collapse

13:32.579 --> 13:34.181
before you get
the warhead disarmed.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.615
Shut those damn
Klaxons down.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.617
Anything that old could spark
and kill us all.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.853
(new alarm beeping loudly)

13:39.887 --> 13:41.588
Well, what now?

13:41.621 --> 13:44.124
The rocket fuel gauge is
dropping dangerously low.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.893
Okay, issue number one--
stopping the fuel leak.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.360
Now, we can 3-D print
a plug that,

13:47.394 --> 13:48.428
once inserted into the puncture,

13:48.461 --> 13:50.998
expands like an umbrella,
fully blocking the leak,

13:51.031 --> 13:52.933
and the polymer printing
material will withstand

13:52.966 --> 13:55.602
the fuel's corrosion long enough
for the Air Force fuel team

13:55.635 --> 13:57.270
to arrive from the base.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.605
We can't replace it
without protective suits.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.606
You guys have that?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.608
We have suits we can fortify
but only so much.

14:01.641 --> 14:02.775
After enough exposure,

14:02.809 --> 14:05.145
those vapors will dissolve
the materials and kill you.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.880
I'll get one.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.581
The metal doors leading into
the silo are also spark risks.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.550
You just came in those doors.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.185
The vapor hadn't risen
to where we were yet.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.888
Now it's permeated through
the entire silo.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.323
The access door on the second
level is rubberized

14:16.356 --> 14:17.624
and spark-safe for fuel techies.

14:17.657 --> 14:21.528
(loud metallic creaking)

14:21.561 --> 14:23.230
That sounds like the beginning
of a death omelet.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.265
And that's issue number two--
shoring up the fuel tanks

14:25.298 --> 14:27.634
so the oxidizer doesn't
collapse it and kill us all.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.436
Adding an inert gas to the fuel

14:29.469 --> 14:30.603
will help maintain
its integrity.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.306
You guys have a supply
of radon, helium?

14:33.340 --> 14:36.009
Uh, there's an artist warehouse
off the highway,

14:36.043 --> 14:37.010
ten minutes from here.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.212
They make neon signs.
The place is all lit up.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.147
Okay, neon gas works.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.582
Okay, me, Happy, and Doc
will go get that.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.185
So, to print the plug,
we need an accurate

14:45.218 --> 14:46.619
measurement of the rupture,

14:46.653 --> 14:48.421
but we can't bring in
a camera, a phone--

14:48.455 --> 14:50.924
anything metal
that could cause a spark.

14:50.958 --> 14:54.661
So the measurement will
have to be eyeballed

14:54.694 --> 14:58.131
by a genius with the talent
to memorize dimensions.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.567
Wonderful.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.070
WALTER: We need to
shore up the hazmat suit

15:03.103 --> 15:05.672
so vapor can't get in,
or you will die.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.607
Every opening sealed,

15:07.640 --> 15:11.011
gloves and helmet duct-taped
for extra protection.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.047
Finally, the oxygen tank,
so you can breathe.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.383
You've got to move fast, Sly.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.384
We don't know how long
you'll have

15:17.417 --> 15:18.718
before the suit's compromised.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.388
Okay, Sly, good to go.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.422
Thumbs up?

15:25.758 --> 15:26.926
I have to pee.

15:39.572 --> 15:40.974
Don't be so hard on yourself.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.976
I'm not. TOBY: Yeah, you are.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.111
You dropped a wrench.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.179
Even Michael Jordan missed
the occasional free throw.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.680
Missing a free throw
never detonated

15:47.714 --> 15:49.082
a nuclear warhead.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.284
As far as we know.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.192
Hey, I got some movie tickets
to the Glendora drive-in.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.760
I did notice how bummed you were

16:00.793 --> 16:02.029
when the waitress
disinvited you,

16:02.062 --> 16:03.997
and I figure we could go,
just us.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.133
I'm not bummed,
and I don't want to go.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.334
Come on.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.337
You and me, provided we prevent
this nuclear explosion.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.473
Okay, which we are nowhere near
pulling off because I blew it.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.642
I got weak and emotional,

16:15.675 --> 16:18.311
and it's all because
that waitress came to Scorpion.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.546
If Walter hadn't hired her,

16:19.579 --> 16:21.448
I would not be
feeling things right now.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.384
I wouldn't have gotten upset
over that stupid drive-in,

16:24.417 --> 16:25.585
I wouldn't have lost focus,

16:25.618 --> 16:27.287
and I wouldn't have
dropped that wrench.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.689
So Walt hiring Paige
three and a half years ago

16:29.722 --> 16:31.724
made you drop that wrench today?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.293
That's interesting logic.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.427
Why do you want
to be human, anyway?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.629
Being human sucks.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.730
She's ruined all of us.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.468
Well, if she hadn't made us
feel and be more human,

16:41.501 --> 16:43.103
then you would have
never married me.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.573
I mean, she is the reason
we're together.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.177
That is a good thing, right?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.615
Right?

16:55.648 --> 16:57.250
(hissing)

16:57.284 --> 16:59.519
Guys, this is bad.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.821
The fuel is rushing out.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.291
The fuel, whose vapors
can eat through my suit.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.226
Plug design is prepared,

17:06.259 --> 17:07.794
and comms are patched
into the speakers.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.497
Sly, the sooner we get
the specs on that rupture,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.199
the sooner you get out of there.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.101
SYLVESTER (over radio):
Getting closer.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.072
You have family?

17:19.106 --> 17:20.473
She's wearing
a hospital bracelet.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.343
JACOBS: She had a circulation
issue when she was born.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.445
That picture was taken
after we got home

17:25.478 --> 17:26.513
from follow-up surgery.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.416
She's doing great now.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.583
You'll see them again.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.123
Best calculation
for the rupture is

17:36.156 --> 17:38.191
14.68 inches circumference,

17:38.225 --> 17:40.460
which I am basing on the memory
of similarly circumferenced

17:40.493 --> 17:41.761
dodgeballs that I was
routinely beaned with

17:41.794 --> 17:42.829
in middle school.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.297
Coming back out.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.832
He's really our best hope?

17:48.135 --> 17:50.303
So you need all this for
some kind of refrigerant?

17:50.337 --> 17:52.472
That's what our boss
from Homeland Security told us.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.706
We're just following orders.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.875
Now, let's get the last tank.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.478
See, old me could care
less about this neon yutz.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.780
New me, Mrs. Feelings,
is screaming inside

18:00.813 --> 18:02.549
because he should be running
away from here as far as he can.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.317
Well, okay, yeah,
but you tell him,

18:04.351 --> 18:06.119
he's gonna tell ten others,
who'll pass it on

18:06.153 --> 18:07.053
and cause a panic.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.122
And then maybe die
driving off in a rush

18:09.156 --> 18:10.823
when we're gonna fix this.
Or not.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.597
She's angrier than usual.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.132
It's just textbook
projection.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.733
She has guilt
for dropping the wrench,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.335
and she's picked Paige
to blame for it.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.637
(horn honking)
Let's go, ladies!

18:24.671 --> 18:27.707
Better Paige than us.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.143
SYLVESTER:
Copy that, Toby.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.279
They're a few miles out,
will be here soon.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.846
We'll help unload the tanks.
(timer beeps)

18:33.880 --> 18:35.782
Plug is finished.

18:35.815 --> 18:39.152
We'll need 20 feet of hose
to connect the neon tanks

18:39.186 --> 18:41.254
to the coupler and...

18:41.288 --> 18:42.822
two hazmat suits
for me and Paige.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.357
Supply closet's down the hall.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.658
Be right out.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.228
It'll, uh... It'll just be
me and you in there.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.563
Alone, dressed
in fancy suits.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.865
Be like a fun date.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.202
Again, I think
we define "date" differently.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.276
HAPPY:
Hoses locked.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.879
(Klaxon blares)

19:06.913 --> 19:08.648
All right, neon's
all hooked up here.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.950
Walt?
Connected.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.151
Okay.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.487
WALTER: When the plug's in
place, we'll give the signal.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.556
(structure creaking)

19:19.626 --> 19:21.794
Sounds like breakfast
is cooking.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.197
No death omelet.
We're gonna get this done.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.265
Guys, double-time.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.399
(hissing)

19:28.601 --> 19:29.736
(both grunting)

19:29.769 --> 19:31.871
It's stuck.
I-I got it.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.312
Go back inside, your suit is
failing around your neck.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.680
It's fine, we're
almost done.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.349
If it ruptures,
the fumes will kill you.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.583
I've got this.
Go inside now.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.219
Okay, just hurry.
Okay.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.521
(grunting)

19:48.555 --> 19:51.291
It's in.
I'm deploying the plug.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.762
(grunts)

19:57.497 --> 19:58.998
Leak stopped.
Happy, the neon.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.933
Here goes nothing.

20:02.902 --> 20:03.970
(structure creaking)

20:04.003 --> 20:06.005
(door opens)

20:06.038 --> 20:07.707
You okay?
Yeah.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.310
Pressure's coming back up.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.511
It's still creaking.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.379
WALTER:
It's a good creaking.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.913
The structure
is regaining integrity.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.382
Well, then come back
to the control room.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.549
It's dangerous as hell in there.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.551
Okay. On my way.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.388
(shouts)

20:27.760 --> 20:28.761
Walter!

20:33.500 --> 20:34.467
What the hell was that?

20:34.501 --> 20:35.635
The vapor must have compromised
the platform.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.804
It gave way and Walter fell.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.272
CABE:
He's knocked out.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.340
His head's in a pool of fuel

20:40.373 --> 20:42.008
at the bottom of the silo.
Walter!

20:42.041 --> 20:42.942
TOBY: That fuel is gonna go
through his suit

20:42.975 --> 20:45.645
like acid.
He's got three minutes, tops.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.814
I'm going back in. Sly, tape up
around my neck fast.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.049
Paige, you'll need an extra
pair of hands down there.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.518
I'll suit up.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.453
Uh, too late. Sorry, Cabe,
only one suit left

20:53.486 --> 20:54.687
and it fits me.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.489
Paige and I are strong enough
to drag out one skinny nerd,

20:56.523 --> 20:58.491
unless it's weird. You and me,
Walt together.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.660
I know you don't like that.
This time it's fine.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.829
PENDERGRAFT: There's one
problem. He fell to level one,

21:02.862 --> 21:04.664
but the door on that level
isn't rubberized.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.065
If you try to access
the silo from there...

21:06.098 --> 21:08.034
Then it sparks, blammo.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.769
So we lower something
down from level two.

21:09.802 --> 21:10.770
We fish him out.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.640
No, a hook or a harness
could tear Walt's suit.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.842
So we got to choose
between a tear or a spark.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.044
It's pretty crappy options.
Damn right.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.479
I vote for none
of the above.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.413
We don't rip the suit

21:20.447 --> 21:22.482
and we open the door
without causing a spark.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.350
Explain.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.784
We could treat the door
like a runway.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.519
In emergency landings,
they foam the runway

21:26.553 --> 21:27.520
to prevent sparks or fires.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.921
It works, sometimes.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.122
Make it work this time.

21:30.156 --> 21:33.393
Okay, I-I'm gonna need baking
soda, vinegar and dish soap.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.334
PAIGE:
Come on, guys.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.606
All right,
that should do it.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.840
Now go get our boy.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.342
SYLVESTER: Cabe, Toby,
get out of there now.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.677
As soon as I remotely open
the blast door,

21:50.710 --> 21:52.645
deadly vapors are coming out.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.614
HAPPY:
Do it now, Sly.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.516
I'm gonna.
Now!

21:56.549 --> 21:58.551
Forgive me if I am tentative,

21:58.585 --> 22:00.387
but if this foam
doesn't prevent a spark,

22:00.420 --> 22:01.654
then we're all dead.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.723
If we don't go in now,
Walt's dead!

22:11.398 --> 22:12.965
PAIGE:
Walter!

22:12.999 --> 22:14.901
HAPPY:
We got you, pal!

22:16.903 --> 22:18.871
Okay, take his other arm.
Okay.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.674
On three.
One, two, three.

22:21.708 --> 22:22.675
Ah, pull harder.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.911
(grunting)

22:26.713 --> 22:27.747
Did it eat
through his suit?

22:27.780 --> 22:29.048
If it had,
he'd be dead already,

22:29.081 --> 22:30.717
and Sleeping Beauty
is just waking up.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.018
PAIGE:
Walter.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.553
We got you. It's okay.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.056
Sign says "no swimming," boss.
Hey, come on.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.531
(Walter groaning)

22:44.564 --> 22:46.633
Walter, are you okay?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.435
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.703
I'm okay.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.705
You guys are a good team.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.376
(Walter groans)

22:59.178 --> 23:02.615
Strategic Air Command has been
updated on our status.

23:02.649 --> 23:03.850
Fuel teams are two hours out.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.017
Plug's holding up.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.620
That thing's tougher
than a two-dollar steak.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.021
(phone ringing)

23:09.055 --> 23:10.757
Patty?

23:10.790 --> 23:11.691
We could not be
in a worse situation.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.993
Uh, I can think of one.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.161
Well, you better think

23:15.194 --> 23:16.729
of a new way to fund
the science club

23:16.763 --> 23:17.930
because our proposal
was just rejected.

23:17.964 --> 23:18.931
What?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.467
It was a rock-solid plan.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.535
Can't allocate
from a budget of zero.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.036
There is no money left.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.005
Finance subcommittee
just broke the news.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.740
So, come up with a plan B.

23:27.774 --> 23:31.077
Uh... I-I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.145
Do you need a lecture
on priorities?

23:33.179 --> 23:34.714
You're an alderman.
Act like one.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.517
How do you act like an alderman?

23:37.550 --> 23:39.118
Council session ends at 7:00.
Be there.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.053
(beeping) HAPPY: Uh, guys,

23:41.087 --> 23:42.121
a little problem here.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.823
Pressure readings
in the fuel tank are way off.

23:43.856 --> 23:47.594
Neon alone would not create
pressure this high.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.662
Why would there be
anything other than neon

23:49.696 --> 23:51.130
in a neon shop's tanks?

23:51.163 --> 23:53.466
Well, neon in signs
is often mixed

23:53.500 --> 23:55.034
with other inert gases
like argon and xenon

23:55.067 --> 23:56.736
to create various colors.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.137
So, if the shop owner

23:58.170 --> 23:59.772
accidentally gave you
a premixed tank...

23:59.806 --> 24:03.576
The additional molecular mass
of the second inert gas

24:03.610 --> 24:04.911
could increase the pressure
up to tenfold!

24:04.944 --> 24:06.078
What the hell
does that mean?

24:06.112 --> 24:08.080
(metal groaning)

24:08.114 --> 24:10.817
(alarm buzzing)

24:13.686 --> 24:15.688
Stopper blew. SYLVESTER:
Our eggs are scrambled.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.524
The rupture has almost
doubled in size!

24:17.557 --> 24:19.892
Fuel is pouring out
twice as fast.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.494
No way to plug it now.

24:21.528 --> 24:22.762
Walter, what do we do?
I don't know.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.631
CABE:
I'm just the intern,

24:24.664 --> 24:26.499
but it's your damn job
to know.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.769
I have an idea.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.671
But no one's
gonna like it.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.973
I like the idea of
exploding even less.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.542
Funny you should
mention explosions

24:35.575 --> 24:38.578
because our only chance
of survival is to trigger one.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.948
Now, we need to blow the fuel
tanks and launch the warhead.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.091
Just so we're clear,
guy with the 197 IQ

24:52.124 --> 24:54.260
wants to blow up a nuke?
Not blow it up. Eject it.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.262
Did that fuel
boil your brain?

24:56.295 --> 24:58.865
You spent the past half hour
saying an explosion is bad.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.567
Yes, but now that we know
one is inevitable,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.268
we need to make it useful
instead of deadly.

25:02.301 --> 25:03.235
I think I follow you.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.572
If we blow it with too much fuel
in the silo,

25:05.605 --> 25:06.706
it won't matter
if the warhead

25:06.739 --> 25:08.708
isn't armed because
the force of the blast

25:08.741 --> 25:10.276
will trigger
a-a nuclear reaction.

25:10.309 --> 25:13.112
And if there's too little fuel causing
an oxidizer collapse... Then the warhead

25:13.145 --> 25:14.781
falls into a fiery pit
and we get the same outcome.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.617
But if we siphon out enough fuel
from the base of the silo...

25:17.650 --> 25:19.251
It'll loosen the warhead and
remove it from the missile.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.621
Then we remotely open
the exterior hatch,

25:21.654 --> 25:23.289
causing a spark
to initiate an explosion

25:23.322 --> 25:24.991
that we've designed
to be the perfect size.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.660
So we get an unarmed warhead

25:27.694 --> 25:29.596
that shoots out
like a cork gun, harmless.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.932
Assuming this works, how will we
know where the warhead ends up?

25:32.965 --> 25:35.334
Uh, we won't exactly.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.603
Airman, what is
the safe landing zone?

25:36.636 --> 25:39.672
All desert and uninhabited hills
for 30 miles around the silo.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.207
Factoring that
into my equation

25:41.240 --> 25:42.241
to keep the warhead
within range.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.409
What about the neon guy?

25:43.442 --> 25:45.578
Well, he's four miles away,
so the force of the blast

25:45.612 --> 25:47.714
will carry this thing ten miles,
go right over him.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.248
TOBY: Since the nuke
won't be armed,

25:49.281 --> 25:50.482
once it's located,
the Air Force techs

25:50.516 --> 25:52.318
are gonna have all the time in
the world to dispose of it.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.922
If the fuel tank pressure
falls into the hot zone, then...

25:57.389 --> 25:59.225
...boom. At this rate,
we have four minutes.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.227
I'll get to work
loosening the warhead.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.896
Looks like I'll have to 3-D
print those wrenches after all.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.097
I'll need help in there.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.065
Walter and I are
already suited up.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.934
Oh, crap, there's only
enough polymer left

26:07.967 --> 26:09.702
to print one wrench.
We need three.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.870
Okay, then we share it.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.371
Uh, Toby, Cabe,

26:12.404 --> 26:13.873
head to the valve room
and start siphoning fuel

26:13.906 --> 26:15.942
from the bottom of the silo.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.076
There's a safe storage basin
on a sublevel.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.244
You can drain
the fuel into that.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.079
Great. Sly, how much
should we siphon out?

26:20.112 --> 26:21.948
I'm working on the numbers.
Stay tuned.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.857
Okay, Paige, you're up.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.197
Here, Walter.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.776
The warhead is
almost disengaged. Cabe?

26:50.877 --> 26:52.812
All right. Good to go, Doc.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.681
Let her rip.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.655
Thar she flows.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.390
Fuel is being sucked
into the pump

27:04.423 --> 27:06.158
and out into the storage basin.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.427
I got the number.
1,502 gallons.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.162
That's the amount of fuel
we need to siphon out.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.430
Any more, any less,

27:11.463 --> 27:13.332
we're goners. Now keep your eye
on that gauge.

27:13.365 --> 27:17.003
Okay. Now, assuming
my fuel math is right,

27:17.036 --> 27:19.438
the curvature of the warhead

27:19.471 --> 27:21.774
underside edges
is shaped perfectly

27:21.808 --> 27:23.843
to ride the blast energy that
will be concentrated beneath it.

27:23.876 --> 27:26.045
That's it.
(laughs)

27:26.078 --> 27:27.179
I found my solution.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.681
For the nuke?

27:28.715 --> 27:29.982
No. For the West Altadenia
Science Club.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.685
(gauge beeping)

27:32.719 --> 27:34.220
Uh, guys,

27:34.253 --> 27:36.322
we are 30 seconds from trouble.
Please tell me you're done.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.825
Just loosening up
the final bolts.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.827
Okay.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.695
Good to go. Now.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.096
SYLVESTER:
Great. Get out of there.

27:49.435 --> 27:50.837
Cabe, Toby,
how's that fuel doing?

27:50.870 --> 27:52.972
And... finito. Cut it.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.907
Okay, Sly,
we're ready down here.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.275
JACOBS:
Readying hatch for breach.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.276
20 seconds.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.278
Good job.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.447
All three of us,
one wrench. Not easy.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.149
For what it's worth...

28:03.182 --> 28:04.817
(panting)

28:04.851 --> 28:07.486
...I'm really glad
we came together in there,

28:07.519 --> 28:08.420
all three of us.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.823
Right, but the truth is

28:10.857 --> 28:12.925
you two do pretty well
on your own, also.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.494
I should've been aware that
that was important to you.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.064
I guess I like hanging
around you guys.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.198
Don't know why.

28:19.231 --> 28:20.733
Thank you.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.773
I'm not sure
that was a compliment.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.507
Opening exterior
hatch now.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.709
Should spark any second.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.815
(alarm beeping)

28:37.984 --> 28:41.954
Please tell me that's
not what I think it is.

28:41.988 --> 28:42.989
It is.

28:50.797 --> 28:53.132
(rumbling)

28:58.137 --> 29:00.907
Well... it worked?

29:00.940 --> 29:02.408
I can't believe it. We're safe!

29:02.441 --> 29:04.376
Not exactly.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.145
There's that tone.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.213
I hate that tone.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.547
SYLVESTER:
Prior to the explosion,

29:08.580 --> 29:10.950
the warhead timer was triggered.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.384
Okay, by what?

29:12.418 --> 29:14.553
The vapor. It must have
corroded the circuit board

29:14.586 --> 29:15.922
and compromised the warhead.

29:15.955 --> 29:16.923
CABE:
So, we just launched

29:16.956 --> 29:19.926
a live nuke somewhere
into a 30-mile radius

29:19.959 --> 29:21.794
and it's gonna detonate
in 20 minutes.

29:21.828 --> 29:22.795
SYLVESTER: No.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.130
19 and a half.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.975
Countdown status?
18 minutes, 32 seconds.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.343
Ah, I can see the headlines.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.178
"Millions Incinerated by
a Crack Team of Geniuses

29:39.211 --> 29:40.446
and Their Crusty Intern."

29:40.479 --> 29:41.413
Zip it. What's the play?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.515
There is no way
to kill the timer remotely.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.117
We can't disarm a nuke
we can't find.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.019
Satellite imagery.
No time.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.288
How about a map? Oh, you
mean the one that tells us

29:49.321 --> 29:51.457
exactly where an '80s-era
warhead with no GPS is located?

29:51.490 --> 29:52.558
That's a great idea.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.227
See, this is why you're
never gonna get promoted.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.262
No, a map in the sky.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.430
Our stopper blew because
we accidentally mixed neon

29:58.464 --> 29:59.832
with other gases, right?

29:59.866 --> 30:01.533
So we check
security footage,

30:01.567 --> 30:03.335
and we look for that big old
neon streak in the sky

30:03.369 --> 30:05.905
when that sucker launched!
Cabe?

30:05.938 --> 30:08.841
You may have a future
in this company after all.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.944
SYLVESTER: I'm pulling up security
footage from the front gate.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.448
Come on, come on.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.450
There! The purple neon arc.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.620
Okay. It's a... exit
angle of 52 degrees...

30:21.653 --> 30:23.622
headed north by northeast.
Object mass,

30:23.655 --> 30:25.624
velocity of the pressure wave,
factoring in

30:25.657 --> 30:27.459
the gravity constant...

30:27.493 --> 30:29.461
Okay, I got it.
Got the location.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.975
How much time?!

30:43.009 --> 30:44.877
31 seconds
till this thing blows!

30:44.911 --> 30:45.912
This blows!

30:47.980 --> 30:49.315
All of you, stay back!

30:59.558 --> 31:02.394
Come on, genius,
you got us into this.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.596
Think.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.066
What are you guys doing?

31:07.099 --> 31:08.600
Get back!
We're staying right here.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.336
Just think of us as an extra
seven wheels of support.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.603
You got this. WALTER: Besides,

31:11.637 --> 31:12.504
it's a nuclear blast,
it doesn't matter

31:12.538 --> 31:14.406
where we stand.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.242
16 seconds. Come on, Happy.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.677
15, 14,

31:18.710 --> 31:20.012
13, oh, God!

31:20.046 --> 31:21.480
Okay, shut up, we can all count.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.149
Come on...

31:23.182 --> 31:25.952
Sweetheart, it doesn't look like
you know what you're doing.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.619
SYLVESTER: Eight.
You know, actually, seven,

31:27.653 --> 31:29.355
because when I said "Oh, God,"
that took a second.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.258
Oh, God, we're down
to three, two, one!

31:34.426 --> 31:36.395
(panting)

31:41.467 --> 31:42.434
SYLVESTER:
What the...?

31:42.468 --> 31:43.535
How...?

31:43.569 --> 31:44.703
How'd you do that?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.372
Pulled the battery.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.240
Puppy can't blow without power.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.342
(laughter)

31:51.610 --> 31:53.579
You know, o-our job
was to decommission the nuke,

31:53.612 --> 31:57.149
and technically,
that's decommissioned, so, um...

31:57.183 --> 31:58.684
we'll send you our bill.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.688
Airman Pendergraft,

32:02.721 --> 32:03.655
I assume the Air Force
can wrap all this up.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.657
I have someplace to be
and I can't be late.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.226
It's really stress-inducing.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.062
What could be
more stressful than this?

32:18.004 --> 32:19.571
Where were you?

32:19.605 --> 32:21.573
You have less than three minutes
before the session ends.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.742
We were busy. JEREMY:
Alderman Dodd.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.577
Glad you could find time
to join us.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.612
Sorry, I was at work.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.614
City government
is work as well.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.216
And you're late.

32:30.249 --> 32:31.750
Not me. Never had a tardy.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.686
Uh, I understand that there
are a few minutes left.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.622
I'd like to talk about saving
the science club.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.457
That's been settled.
There's no money in the budget.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.558
There will be.

32:39.591 --> 32:40.659
Once we put a hat

32:40.692 --> 32:43.195
on every lamppost
in West Altadenia.

32:50.602 --> 32:51.803
You see, if we use

32:51.837 --> 32:54.673
a reflective surface for the
underside of each conical cover,

32:54.706 --> 32:57.576
not unlike the shape of the
bottom of a nuclear warhead,

32:57.609 --> 32:58.710
then, electric light,

32:58.744 --> 33:01.280
that our city pays for,
that currently and wastefully

33:01.313 --> 33:03.182
shines up into the night sky,

33:03.215 --> 33:06.218
will be redirected
back down to the streets.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.787
We will yield
the same brightness

33:08.820 --> 33:11.157
using bulbs of half the wattage.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.791
Citywide,

33:12.824 --> 33:16.195
that's an energy savings
of over $250,000 annually.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.497
And we only need $6,000
for the science club.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.532
(murmuring indistinctly)

33:23.569 --> 33:25.337
Actually, this could work.

33:25.371 --> 33:28.440
Mr. Dodd, you seem to really
care about this science club.

33:28.474 --> 33:32.044
I do. (chuckles)
I do care.

33:32.078 --> 33:33.712
Oh, my gosh, I do care.

33:33.745 --> 33:35.147
I got to go.

33:37.183 --> 33:40.352
Now, that's how you act
like an alderman.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.789
I want to be your attorney.

33:43.822 --> 33:44.790
You want to what?

33:44.823 --> 33:46.758
He inhaled too much vapor.

33:46.792 --> 33:47.759
Sylvester, you're not
an attorney.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.295
Not yet.
I looked it up:

33:49.328 --> 33:50.629
Vermont lets you take
the bar exam

33:50.662 --> 33:52.164
even if you never went
to law school.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.599
You pass, you're licensed.

33:53.632 --> 33:54.700
Then, since it's
a federal case,

33:54.733 --> 33:57.169
all I got to do is get
sworn in by the federal bar.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.737
Okay. Speaking of the bar,
how do you plan on passing?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.607
Well, actually, he does
have perfect recall.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.642
With adequate preparation,
Sly would ace it.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.111
I've got 48 hours.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.712
The bar exam's in two days?

34:06.745 --> 34:07.813
CABE: Kid, do you even know
how extensive

34:07.846 --> 34:09.315
the bar exam is?

34:09.348 --> 34:10.616
You got to know criminal law,

34:10.649 --> 34:11.750
criminal procedure...

34:11.783 --> 34:13.119
Contracts, evidence...

34:13.152 --> 34:14.720
Real property, torts...

34:14.753 --> 34:16.755
It's a five hour flight.
It'll be plenty of time.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.358
Come on, guys.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.427
I see solutions
when others don't.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.629
I just convinced
a dais of bureaucrats

34:23.662 --> 34:25.431
to change the way
they light their city

34:25.464 --> 34:28.334
to save a science program
because I cared.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.202
Toby, you said
so yourself:

34:30.236 --> 34:32.704
we will never find a lawyer
that cares about Cabe

34:32.738 --> 34:34.206
as much as we do.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.341
Well, I care about Cabe.

34:35.374 --> 34:36.808
And I will scour every law book

34:36.842 --> 34:40.146
and memorize every archaic
regulation to protect him.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.046
I can do this.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.781
With all of our
research capabilities

34:42.814 --> 34:44.783
and our brain power,
we can do this.

34:44.816 --> 34:45.751
Together.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.419
(Toby clapping)

34:47.453 --> 34:50.756
Is the kid getting good
at speeches or what?

34:50.789 --> 34:52.891
Somebody get my lawyer
a ticket to Montpelier.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.160
I'm on it.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.774
(speaking indistinctly)

35:14.480 --> 35:16.248
Okay, darling,
what do you say

35:16.282 --> 35:18.250
we get out of this dusty
garage and head home?

35:18.284 --> 35:19.585
Uh, yeah, in a few.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.821
I just want to organize
my workstation a bit.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.926
Happy, they're not gonna
invite you along tonight.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.295
Yeah.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.796
I know.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.798
I don't want to go
anywhere with them, anyway.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.433
I've seen a lot of them lately.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.502
Okay, one, you do want
to go along with them.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.770
And two, no I-I'm
actually not hurt

35:38.804 --> 35:39.871
that you don't want
to spend time

35:39.905 --> 35:40.806
with your brand-new,
shiny husband.

35:40.839 --> 35:41.940
Do you want to know why?

35:41.973 --> 35:43.008
No.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.943
Because your being drawn
to Walter, Paige and Ralph

35:44.976 --> 35:46.778
is perfectly logical.

35:46.812 --> 35:50.349
You spent your childhood
yearning for a nuclear family,

35:50.382 --> 35:52.684
and now, every single day,
you see a mother figure

35:52.718 --> 35:54.953
and a father figure and a child.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.955
It soothes a
very wounded

35:56.988 --> 36:00.559
part of your psyche
to be with them.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.827
That's perfectly okay.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.929
But now that you know
why you were doing it,

36:03.962 --> 36:05.964
and Paige is making
you feel more things,

36:05.997 --> 36:08.734
and that's good, and...

36:08.767 --> 36:13.405
maybe you could just
ease off a little bit.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.409
I want a baby.

36:19.645 --> 36:20.946
Okay.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.248
I was thinking
Kovelsky's, but...

36:22.281 --> 36:24.683
I want a baby.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.884
Soon.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.554
Okay, you were right.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.856
I want a family.
I've always wanted a family.

36:30.889 --> 36:35.227
And I want one with you,
'cause I love you.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.731
But... the woman
who hates being human

36:39.765 --> 36:41.400
wants to make another human?

36:41.433 --> 36:43.835
Yeah, something like that.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.372
Shall we start now?

36:46.405 --> 36:47.473
Uh, not-not-not here,

36:47.506 --> 36:49.007
not in front of everyone.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.008
Right, yeah.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.543
(chuckling):
Let's go.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.216
Hey, go get your coat so I can
take you to the sitter's. Okay?

37:02.621 --> 37:04.990
Now that we
have a moment,

37:05.023 --> 37:07.025
I would like
to confess something to you.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.994
Okay.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.363
I didn't encourage Happy
to hang out with us

37:11.397 --> 37:12.698
because I liked it so much.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.000
Uh, yeah, she is one of
my best friends, but, uh,

37:15.033 --> 37:17.636
I would prefer
one-on-one time with you.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.371
I just-- I didn't want you to...

37:19.405 --> 37:21.006
(chuckles softly)

37:21.039 --> 37:22.908
...think otherwise.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.444
Okay, I appreciate the honesty.

37:25.477 --> 37:28.347
But if you preferred being with
just me, then why didn't...?

37:28.380 --> 37:31.517
I'm nervous
to be alone with you.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.487
You've been alone with me
hundreds of times.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.055
Wh-What could you possibly
be nervous about?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.256
My biggest fear

37:38.290 --> 37:40.892
is being in a restaurant,
droning on about genius things,

37:40.926 --> 37:43.629
and then looking up at your
face, and then seeing boredom.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.765
I-It happens after a few
weeks of every relationship

37:46.798 --> 37:48.367
that I've been in.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.969
And then they end.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.004
And, uh...

37:53.038 --> 37:55.507
I don't want this one to end.

37:55.541 --> 37:56.842
Walter.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.544
We are not a few weeks
into our relationship.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.679
We are three years in.
I know you.

38:00.712 --> 38:01.913
Okay?

38:01.947 --> 38:05.917
And I have an idea of a place
where we can go have dinner,

38:05.951 --> 38:09.621
and you don't have to worry
about seeing boredom on my face.

38:10.656 --> 38:11.990
WALTER:
Okay,

38:12.023 --> 38:13.592
so, uh, what's your big plan?

38:13.625 --> 38:14.960
You'll see.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.865
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:19.898 --> 38:23.335
your sensory experience
is about to begin.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.606
See you later, Walter.
Huh?

38:27.639 --> 38:28.840
(people gasping)

38:28.874 --> 38:31.076
What's going on?

38:31.109 --> 38:32.978
You said you were worried
about looking across the table

38:33.011 --> 38:34.546
and seeing a bored look
on my face?

38:34.580 --> 38:36.114
Well, here, you won't
have that problem.

38:36.147 --> 38:39.718
You eat without seeing, in order
to enhance the other senses.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.120
Paige, that is very thoughtful,
but this is ridiculous.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.456
See, uh, this is a gimmick

38:44.490 --> 38:47.025
most likely to mask
the mediocre food.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.827
Just give it a chance.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.429
WAITER: Good evening! Oh!

38:50.462 --> 38:51.763
We will begin with a selection

38:51.797 --> 38:53.765
of locally sourced
root vegetables

38:53.799 --> 38:56.001
served with mayonnaise
three ways.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.903
Mayonnaise has more
than one way?

38:57.936 --> 38:59.438
Still or effervescent, sir?

38:59.471 --> 39:00.806
Uh, tap's fine.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.809
First of all, mayonnaise
only comes one way.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.110
Second of all, "effervescent"?

39:05.143 --> 39:06.077
Pretentious.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.747
Third of all,
I guarantee you that our waiter

39:08.780 --> 39:09.948
is a hipster doofus

39:09.981 --> 39:12.618
with a logging camp beard
and a man bun.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.453
Sir, I'm still here.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.054
I thought you went to get water.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.723
I have the water.
I was ready to pour,

39:17.756 --> 39:19.090
but you were
still talking, so...

39:19.124 --> 39:20.125
WALTER:
Oh.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.160
Okay. Well, let me help
you out here. Okay.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.128
I got it-- I'm sorry.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.696
WAITER:
Oh! Oh, God!

39:24.730 --> 39:26.632
God!
Sir!

39:28.434 --> 39:29.568
Oh...

39:29.601 --> 39:31.069
What's going on here?

39:31.102 --> 39:32.771
I-- I could use a napkin.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.441
(both chuckle)

39:35.474 --> 39:36.942
(both laughing)

39:36.975 --> 39:38.610
I can't believe
that just happened.

39:38.644 --> 39:41.146
I think I have three different
kinds of mayonnaise on me.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.682
For the record,

39:43.715 --> 39:47.486
that waiter looked exactly
as I described him.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.120
(laughs)

39:49.154 --> 39:53.459
For the record,
I could never get bored of you.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.060
(chuckles)
