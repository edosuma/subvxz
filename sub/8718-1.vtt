00:30.262 --> 00:32.058
What was that?

00:33.462 --> 00:36.260
Just a child of the night,
Jonathan.

00:39.262 --> 00:41.571
Come.

00:41.662 --> 00:44.495
Sit here beside me
on the veranda.

00:53.462 --> 00:55.100
It's chilly out here.

00:55.302 --> 00:59.261
Oh, no, it isn't.

00:59.342 --> 01:00.695
It's beautiful.

01:03.102 --> 01:04.979
I love the night so.

01:08.182 --> 01:10.980
I've never seen you look
so beautiful before, Nina.

01:12.342 --> 01:14.731
So pale.

01:14.822 --> 01:16.574
So...

01:16.662 --> 01:18.095
luminescent.

01:19.142 --> 01:20.416
So...

01:20.502 --> 01:21.855
Yes?

01:23.262 --> 01:26.095
- Your lips are so red.
-Are they?

01:27.102 --> 01:29.457
Would you like to kiss them?

01:41.622 --> 01:45.058
Why are you looking at me
so strangely, Nina?

01:45.142 --> 01:47.292
Not you, Jonathan.

01:47.382 --> 01:48.735
Your neck.

01:51.342 --> 01:54.334
Has anyone ever told you...

01:54.422 --> 01:56.492
it was beautiful?

01:57.382 --> 01:59.816
- No.
- Come.

02:01.142 --> 02:04.020
Lay your head on my breast.

02:14.782 --> 02:16.135
Stop...

02:16.222 --> 02:18.099
you creature of the night!

02:23.862 --> 02:26.660
Who are you who interrupts
my nightly feeding?

02:27.902 --> 02:30.575
I... am...

02:30.662 --> 02:32.732
Peter Vincent...

02:32.822 --> 02:35.211
vampire killer!

02:40.462 --> 02:43.260
Keep away!
Keep away from me!

03:11.822 --> 03:14.256
And now your host...

03:14.342 --> 03:16.173
Peter Vincent.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.253
Fright Night!

03:18.342 --> 03:20.776
This is Peter Vincent...

03:20.862 --> 03:23.934
bringing you
Fright Night Theatre.

03:24.022 --> 03:26.741
Charley!
Peter Vincent's on-

03:26.822 --> 03:28.574
Forget Peter Vincent-

03:28.662 --> 03:30.175
But you love him-

03:30.262 --> 03:32.218
But I love you more-

03:34.382 --> 03:39.172
Tonight's journey into horror is...

03:39.262 --> 03:40.900
Blood Castle-

03:40.982 --> 03:43.621
It will keep you
on the edge of your seat.

03:43.702 --> 03:46.011
- Stop it-
- I know it will.

03:46.102 --> 03:48.138
It is one of my favourites.

03:48.222 --> 03:50.417
And for a very good reason.

03:50.502 --> 03:52.333
I star in it.

04:02.262 --> 04:04.173
Fright Night!

04:05.502 --> 04:08.414
Charley, I said stop it!

04:08.542 --> 04:11.614
Jesus, Amy,
give me a break!

04:11.742 --> 04:13.858
We've been going together
almost a year-

04:13.942 --> 04:16.331
All I ever hear is
"Charley, stop it-"

04:20.902 --> 04:22.130
I'm sorry-

04:26.302 --> 04:27.781
Me too-

04:27.862 --> 04:29.853
I'm just scared, that's all-

04:42.262 --> 04:44.093
Let's get into bed-

04:46.662 --> 04:48.459
You mean it?

05:23.822 --> 05:25.972
Charley---

05:26.062 --> 05:27.256
I'm ready-

05:27.342 --> 05:29.572
Amy, you're not gonna
believe this-

05:29.662 --> 05:32.301
There are two guys in the yard
carrying a coffin-

05:33.502 --> 05:35.811
We have pledged ourselves
to evil.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.620
Sure-

05:37.702 --> 05:39.658
And they're on the moors,
right?

05:39.742 --> 05:42.097
- Amy, I'm serious-
- So am l-

05:42.182 --> 05:44.173
Do you want to make love
or not?

05:49.022 --> 05:52.298
Amy, quick, come here-
You gotta see this-

05:56.062 --> 05:58.053
Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin---

05:58.142 --> 06:00.417
but I saw two guys carrying
something into that house-

06:00.502 --> 06:01.855
I don't understand you-

06:01.942 --> 06:04.740
First you want to make love,
and then you don't-

06:05.982 --> 06:07.381
What's wrong?

06:08.262 --> 06:09.490
Nothing, Mom-

06:09.582 --> 06:10.935
Come in here, you two-

06:14.542 --> 06:16.851
Are you kids having
a lovers' spat?

06:16.942 --> 06:18.853
No, Mom-
Nothing like that-

06:18.942 --> 06:21.092
Well, there's nothing
wrong with it-

06:21.182 --> 06:23.013
The divorce rate is 76% higher---

06:23.102 --> 06:25.662
among couples who don't argue
before marriage-

06:25.742 --> 06:29.098
- We're in high school!
- Never hurts to plan ahead-

06:29.182 --> 06:33.778
Amy, will you remind your mother we're
playing poker at her house this weekend?

06:33.862 --> 06:35.659
Yes, Mrs Brewster-

06:36.542 --> 06:38.055
Good night, Charley-

06:38.142 --> 06:39.734
Yeah, good night-

06:41.862 --> 06:43.659
- Good night, Mrs Brewster-
- Good night-

06:43.742 --> 06:45.300
Thanks for helping
with Charley's homework-

06:45.382 --> 06:46.781
Anytime-

06:48.382 --> 06:49.735
See you tomorrow, Charley?

06:55.622 --> 06:58.853
Charley, that wasn't very nice,
not walking Amy to the front door-

06:58.942 --> 07:00.773
There are people next door-

07:00.862 --> 07:03.171
I guess the new owner's
moving in-

07:03.262 --> 07:05.253
- What new owner?
- Didn't I tell you?

07:05.342 --> 07:08.140
Bob Hoskins said he finally
got rid of the place-

07:08.222 --> 07:11.658
- Who'd he sell it to?
- Some fella who fixes up houses-

07:11.742 --> 07:13.698
Supposed to be very attractive-

07:13.782 --> 07:17.013
I just hope he knows what
he's getting into with this house-

07:17.102 --> 07:19.172
It's gonna take a lot of work--

07:19.262 --> 07:22.937
A man was found murdered tonight
behind the railroad yards.

07:23.022 --> 07:26.298
Details are pending,
awaiting notification of next of kin.

07:27.982 --> 07:30.780
Thank you, Mr Smith-
Have a good weekend-

07:30.862 --> 07:32.932
That bastard!

07:33.022 --> 07:35.820
Why didn't he tell us
he was gonna spring a pop quiz?

07:35.902 --> 07:39.975
That's the point to a pop quiz--
to surprise you-

07:40.062 --> 07:41.814
Thanks, teach-

07:41.902 --> 07:43.255
Hey, Amy-

07:44.942 --> 07:47.740
Did she finally find out
what you're really like?

07:47.822 --> 07:49.301
Buzz off, Evil-

07:49.382 --> 07:51.657
Oh- Call me
anything you want-

07:51.742 --> 07:54.210
You're the one failing trig,
not me-

08:20.582 --> 08:22.459
Is this 99 Oak?

08:22.542 --> 08:24.772
No, that's next door-

08:24.862 --> 08:26.773
Thanks-

08:36.741 --> 08:39.495
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah- I'm in here-

08:41.741 --> 08:43.573
Have you seen
the new guy next door?

08:43.662 --> 08:46.051
No, but he's got
a live-in carpenter-

08:46.142 --> 08:48.133
With my luck,
he's probably gay-

08:48.222 --> 08:49.701
I don't think so-

08:49.782 --> 08:52.580
- Why? What do you know that I don't?
- Oh, nothing-

08:52.662 --> 08:54.380
I gotta go study-

08:54.462 --> 08:56.692
Study? You?

09:33.302 --> 09:34.701
Hi-

09:38.302 --> 09:40.133
I'm really sorry
about the other night-

09:40.222 --> 09:42.736
It was my fault, not yours-

09:42.822 --> 09:44.050
It was?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.811
Look, Amy, I love you-

09:49.502 --> 09:51.811
I never wanna fight
with you again-

09:51.902 --> 09:54.211
I'm so glad we're getting this
straightened out-

09:54.302 --> 09:57.419
- Police have reported a second murder.
- I've been miserable the past two days-

09:57.502 --> 09:59.538
The second victim,
whose body was found this morning...

09:59.622 --> 10:01.613
was a known prostitute.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.977
Not talkin' to you
on the phone--

10:04.062 --> 10:05.893
Charley, are you
listening to me?

10:05.982 --> 10:10.055
The mutilated corpse was found under
the North Creek bridge by the old mill.

10:10.142 --> 10:11.575
There are no leads--

10:11.662 --> 10:15.052
- Know what I heard on the police band?
- What?

10:15.142 --> 10:17.815
That wasn't the only murder-

10:17.902 --> 10:19.733
The second in two days-

10:20.862 --> 10:23.171
And get this--

10:23.262 --> 10:26.572
both of'em
had their heads chopped off-

10:26.662 --> 10:28.175
Can you believe it?

10:28.262 --> 10:30.059
You're sick-

10:43.862 --> 10:46.615
You're so cool, Brewster!

10:47.702 --> 10:49.135
I can't stand it!

11:23.902 --> 11:24.812
Hey, kid!

11:27.502 --> 11:30.380
- What are you doing?
- Nothin'-

11:30.462 --> 11:32.020
Oh, yeah?

11:32.102 --> 11:35.014
Well, just make sure
that it stays that way---

11:35.102 --> 11:36.330
kid-

13:59.742 --> 14:02.540
Mom, get up! I can't believe
what's happening next door!

14:02.622 --> 14:04.453
- What?
- He has fangs-

14:04.542 --> 14:06.737
The guy who bought the house
has fangs-

14:06.822 --> 14:10.417
Fangs- That's lovely-
I have to get up at 7:00 tomorrow-

14:15.502 --> 14:17.333
Fangs? Charley!

15:03.582 --> 15:05.095
You forgot something-

15:49.022 --> 15:51.820
This microwave never melts
the marshmallows right-

15:51.902 --> 15:53.813
Drink that-

15:53.902 --> 15:56.939
I don't need hot cocoa-
I didn't have a nightmare-

15:57.022 --> 15:59.411
They did kill a girl
over there-

15:59.502 --> 16:02.300
- How late did you stay up studying?
- Mom, I'm not sick!

16:02.382 --> 16:04.213
The guy did have fangs-

16:04.302 --> 16:07.658
A bat did fly over my head and a second
later he stepped out of the shadows-

16:07.742 --> 16:09.573
Don't you see what that means?

16:09.662 --> 16:10.936
Wait, let me guess-

16:11.022 --> 16:12.057
What?

16:13.022 --> 16:14.853
He's a vampire!

16:15.582 --> 16:16.651
A what?

16:17.982 --> 16:21.577
A vampire! Haven't you listened
to anything I've said?

16:23.822 --> 16:26.859
Charley, is this
some sort of a trick---

16:26.942 --> 16:28.773
to get me back?

16:30.142 --> 16:32.781
Forget it-
I'm going to the police-

16:32.862 --> 16:35.660
You can't tell the police that-
They'll lock you up-

16:35.742 --> 16:38.540
All right, I won't tell them
he's a vampire-

16:38.622 --> 16:41.614
But I sure am gonna tell them
about the two women-

16:54.782 --> 16:56.773
You're sure about this now?

17:03.982 --> 17:06.098
- Yes?
- Mr Dandrige?

17:06.182 --> 17:08.650
No, I'm his roommate,
Billy Cole-

17:08.742 --> 17:12.178
Lieutenant Lennox, Homicide-
Do you mind if we come in?

17:12.262 --> 17:14.412
No, not at all-
Come on in-

17:21.942 --> 17:24.058
This is quite a place
you have here-

17:24.142 --> 17:27.214
- Yeah- We're restoring it-
- Where is Mr Dandrige?

17:27.301 --> 17:28.894
He's away on business-

17:28.982 --> 17:31.974
- Can I help you?
- There was a murder last night-

17:32.062 --> 17:35.259
Your neighbour Charley thinks
he saw the victim in this house-

17:35.342 --> 17:37.936
That's impossible-
I was here with Jerry last night-

17:38.022 --> 17:40.695
- There was nobody else here-
- That's a lie-

17:40.782 --> 17:43.580
I saw him carry her body out
in a plastic bag-

17:43.662 --> 17:45.971
What do you say to that?

17:46.062 --> 17:49.338
Kid's crazy- I took some bags out,
but they were full of trash-

17:49.422 --> 17:50.457
Amy?

17:50.542 --> 17:52.180
Here, let me show you-

17:52.262 --> 17:56.380
Look, the bag I saw
had a body in it, not trash-

17:56.462 --> 17:58.817
You actually see the body,
Charley?

18:00.622 --> 18:02.931
- Well, no, but--
- Okay-

18:03.022 --> 18:06.731
Let me take you out back- I'll show you
the bags I put in the garbage-

18:06.822 --> 18:09.859
- Okay, let's see them-
- I can prove he's lying!

18:12.022 --> 18:13.819
Let's look in the basement
instead-

18:13.902 --> 18:15.620
What's down there, Charley?

18:15.702 --> 18:18.216
Yes, Charley-
What's down there?

18:21.702 --> 18:24.011
Obviously the boy's
made a mistake, Officer-

18:24.102 --> 18:27.572
A coffin! That's what's down there-
I saw them carry it in-

18:28.582 --> 18:29.651
What?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.495
Jerry Dandrige is in it,
sleeping the sleep of the undead-

18:35.662 --> 18:37.493
What are you talking about?

18:37.582 --> 18:39.538
- He's a vampire-
- Uh-oh!

18:39.622 --> 18:42.739
I saw him last night- He had fangs,
and he bit her on the neck-

18:42.822 --> 18:44.540
For heaven's sake!

18:44.622 --> 18:46.340
- Come on-
- What?

18:46.422 --> 18:48.982
Wait!
We can't just leave like this!

18:49.062 --> 18:51.292
I got a coffin for you!

18:51.382 --> 18:53.259
I don't care what you say!

18:55.622 --> 18:57.453
Lieutenant,
please listen to me!

18:57.542 --> 19:01.057
Look, I'm telling you,
Jerry Dandrige is a vampire-

19:01.142 --> 19:03.417
Sure, and I'm Dirty Harry-
Listen-

19:03.502 --> 19:07.415
If I ever catch your ass at the station
again, I'm throwing it in jail forever!

19:07.502 --> 19:10.300
Lieutenant,
just listen to me for a second!

19:10.382 --> 19:13.055
I know it's crazy!
I know that, but--

19:13.142 --> 19:14.734
Look, Lieutenant--

19:34.862 --> 19:36.420
Oh, my God-

20:01.382 --> 20:03.532
Evil!

20:06.382 --> 20:09.340
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

20:09.422 --> 20:11.413
The vampire knows
I know about him-

20:11.502 --> 20:14.062
Or at least he will
when he wakes up tonight-

20:14.142 --> 20:15.621
What are you talking about?

20:15.702 --> 20:17.693
A vampire is living
next door to me---

20:17.782 --> 20:20.455
and he's gonna kill me
if I don't protect myself-

20:22.262 --> 20:24.651
- What?
- I haven't got time to explain-

20:24.742 --> 20:27.859
Just tell me what to do
to protect myself-

20:27.942 --> 20:29.978
Very funny, Brewster-

20:30.062 --> 20:32.257
Evil, please!
I'm not kidding!

20:32.342 --> 20:35.493
- Tell me what to do!
- Don't call me Evil any more!

20:36.622 --> 20:39.090
Why should I help you anyway?

20:39.182 --> 20:41.173
Look, I've got eight bucks-

20:41.262 --> 20:43.332
Help me and it's yours-

20:45.302 --> 20:48.453
Far be it from me
to turn down a fool's money-

20:54.222 --> 20:58.261
Where and when do you expect
the vampire to attack?

20:58.342 --> 21:00.139
In my bedroom, tonight-

21:04.902 --> 21:07.336
Start with this-

21:07.422 --> 21:12.576
But you must have total faith in it
for it to work-

21:12.662 --> 21:14.618
Then get some garlic-

21:14.702 --> 21:17.978
Links of the stuff you can wear around
your neck and hang from your window-

21:18.062 --> 21:21.737
If he comes for you,
that'll be the way- Then--

21:21.822 --> 21:24.973
Oh, of course!
There's holy water!

21:25.062 --> 21:29.135
But you gotta get a priest
to say a blessing over it first-

21:30.622 --> 21:32.897
- That's it?
- I'm afraid so-

21:32.982 --> 21:36.213
But your best protection
right now, Charles---

21:36.302 --> 21:39.533
is that a vampire
cannot enter your house---

21:39.622 --> 21:43.695
without being invited
by the rightful owner first-

21:43.782 --> 21:46.137
- Are you sure?
- Positive-

21:47.582 --> 21:49.095
Thank you- Thank you-

22:04.222 --> 22:08.420
Charley, could you come here, please?
There's someone I'd like you to meet-

22:09.622 --> 22:10.975
Yeah, Mom-

22:15.142 --> 22:17.337
Charley, this is
our next-door neighbour---

22:17.422 --> 22:19.219
Jerry Dandrige-

22:29.542 --> 22:30.895
Hello, Charley-

22:36.382 --> 22:38.816
Charley, don't be rude-
Shake hands-

22:48.342 --> 22:52.130
- What's he doing here?
- I invited him for a drink-

22:52.222 --> 22:53.940
You what?

22:54.022 --> 22:56.490
I invited him over-
Why?

22:56.582 --> 22:57.935
What's the matter, Charley?

22:58.022 --> 23:01.332
Afraid I'd never come over
without being invited first?

23:02.382 --> 23:04.020
You're quite right-

23:04.102 --> 23:06.411
Of course, now that
I've been made welcome---

23:06.502 --> 23:09.300
I'll probably drop by
quite a bit-

23:09.382 --> 23:12.260
In fact,
anytime I feel like it-

23:14.502 --> 23:17.300
With your mother's
kind permission, of course-

23:17.382 --> 23:19.612
Oh,Jerry, anytime-

23:21.302 --> 23:25.090
It's nice that someone interesting has
finally moved into the neighbourhood-

23:27.222 --> 23:29.213
Charley, are you all right?

23:31.062 --> 23:33.053
Yeah, Mom, I'm fine-

23:34.582 --> 23:36.777
I just gotta get back
to my trig-

23:36.862 --> 23:38.341
Nice to meet you-

23:39.622 --> 23:41.533
See you-

23:41.622 --> 23:43.294
Soon-

27:11.142 --> 27:13.372
We wouldn't want to wake
your mother, would we?

27:14.702 --> 27:17.262
Then I'd have to kill her too-

27:17.342 --> 27:18.855
Right?

27:43.102 --> 27:46.617
Do you realize how much trouble
you've caused me?

27:46.702 --> 27:48.818
Spying on me-

27:48.902 --> 27:51.700
Almost disturbing my sleep
this afternoon-

27:53.182 --> 27:55.093
Telling policemen about me!

28:05.622 --> 28:08.136
You deserve to die, boy-

28:12.302 --> 28:16.090
Of course, I could give you
something I don't have-

28:16.182 --> 28:17.581
A choice-

28:18.822 --> 28:20.938
Forget about me, Charley-

28:22.062 --> 28:24.292
Forget about me,
and I'll forget about you-

28:24.382 --> 28:26.213
What do you say, Charley?

28:38.422 --> 28:39.821
Fool-

29:56.582 --> 29:57.935
Charley!

30:12.382 --> 30:14.691
Charley, can you hear me?

30:22.062 --> 30:23.461
Charley, is that you?

30:24.782 --> 30:26.261
My door is stuck-

30:37.062 --> 30:40.452
- What is going on?
- Nothing- I just had a nightmare-

30:41.662 --> 30:44.734
I had one last night-
It was awful-

30:44.822 --> 30:48.861
I was at this white sale
and suddenly realized I was stark naked-

30:49.902 --> 30:51.733
- Now what is it?
- Nothing-

30:51.822 --> 30:53.653
Just raccoons
in the garbage again-

30:53.742 --> 30:56.176
- Go back to sleep-
- But what about your nightmare?

30:56.262 --> 30:58.730
- Do you want a Valium?
- I'm fine now-

30:58.822 --> 31:01.290
- Honest-
- I do need my sleep-

31:01.382 --> 31:05.011
I start the night shift tomorrow-
3:00 in the morning-

31:05.102 --> 31:07.900
- It's so bad for my complexion-
- Good night, Mom-

31:56.902 --> 31:58.938
I know you're there, Charley-

31:59.022 --> 32:00.660
I can see you-

32:09.982 --> 32:11.654
What's the matter, Charley?

32:11.742 --> 32:13.619
Scared?

32:14.662 --> 32:18.291
You started this, Charley,
and I'm gonna finish it.

32:21.422 --> 32:23.572
I just destroyed your car,
Charley-

32:25.182 --> 32:28.458
But that's nothing compared
to what I'm gonna do to you---

32:30.822 --> 32:32.175
tomorrow night-

32:38.782 --> 32:40.852
Once again, your host...

32:40.942 --> 32:42.694
Peter Vincent.

32:42.782 --> 32:45.091
Good evening, horror fans.

32:45.182 --> 32:48.060
Did you know
there are a lot of people...

32:48.142 --> 32:50.610
who do not believe in vampires?

32:51.462 --> 32:52.861
But I do...

32:52.942 --> 32:56.617
because I know they exist.

32:56.702 --> 33:01.378
I have fought them
in all their guises--

33:01.462 --> 33:05.137
man, wolves, bats--

33:05.222 --> 33:09.579
and I have always won!

33:10.502 --> 33:12.857
That is why they call me...

33:12.942 --> 33:15.410
the great vampire killer.

33:17.142 --> 33:18.541
Now...

33:19.782 --> 33:21.818
watch me do it.

33:31.062 --> 33:32.336
Go, Peter-

33:37.302 --> 33:39.020
Go-

33:49.862 --> 33:53.821
Mr Vincent,
could I talk to you for a minute?

33:53.902 --> 33:56.462
Please, Mr Vincent-
It's very, very important-

33:56.542 --> 33:59.739
- What do you want me to sign?
- Pardon me?

33:59.822 --> 34:01.733
You do want my autograph,
don't you?

34:02.862 --> 34:06.093
No, sir, I was curious about
what you said last night on TV---

34:06.182 --> 34:08.013
about believing in vampires-

34:08.101 --> 34:09.853
What about it?

34:09.942 --> 34:11.500
Were you serious?

34:12.302 --> 34:13.655
Oh, absolutely-

34:15.422 --> 34:18.219
Unfortunately,
none of your generation seems to be-

34:18.302 --> 34:19.701
What do you mean?

34:19.782 --> 34:23.331
I have just been fired because nobody
wants to see vampire killers any more---

34:23.422 --> 34:24.935
or vampires either-

34:25.022 --> 34:27.741
Apparently all they want
are demented madmen---

34:27.822 --> 34:31.417
running around in ski masks
hacking up young virgins-

34:31.502 --> 34:32.821
Excuse me-

34:34.462 --> 34:36.293
I believe in vampires-

34:42.141 --> 34:43.335
That's nice-

34:44.661 --> 34:48.257
If only there had been more of you,
perhaps my ratings would've been higher-

34:48.342 --> 34:51.971
In fact, I have one
living next door to me-

34:52.062 --> 34:53.893
Would you help me kill him?

34:56.581 --> 34:57.856
Pardon me?

34:57.942 --> 35:00.410
You know that murder
a few days ago?

35:00.502 --> 35:02.015
Yes-

35:02.102 --> 35:06.061
The guy who lives next door to me
did it, and he's a vampire-

35:07.742 --> 35:11.496
If this is your idea of a joke,
I am not amused-

35:11.582 --> 35:13.573
Mr Vincent, I am not joking-

35:13.662 --> 35:15.732
I am deadly serious-

35:16.822 --> 35:19.655
Well, if you would excuse me--

35:20.742 --> 35:23.654
But, Mr Vincent,
you have to believe me-

35:23.742 --> 35:27.496
I'm telling the truth-
You just said you believed in vampires-

35:27.582 --> 35:29.618
I lied-

35:29.702 --> 35:31.533
Now, if you will leave me alone--

35:31.622 --> 35:33.453
You have to listen to me!

35:33.542 --> 35:35.976
The vampire tried
to kill me last night---

35:36.062 --> 35:38.132
and trashed my car
when he didn't succeed-

35:38.222 --> 35:43.091
He's gonna be back tonight-
If I don't get help, he's gonna kill me-

35:43.182 --> 35:45.013
Mr Vincent!

35:45.102 --> 35:47.457
Just listen to me for a second-

35:47.542 --> 35:48.975
No! Wait!

35:49.062 --> 35:51.178
Please, Mr Vincent!
Wait!

35:57.302 --> 36:00.692
- What are you doing here?
- What about you? You just dumped him-

36:00.782 --> 36:04.218
- It's none of your business-
- So you do like him-

36:04.302 --> 36:05.655
Anybody home?

36:13.982 --> 36:15.540
Wow-

36:21.422 --> 36:23.333
What's all this for?

36:23.422 --> 36:25.458
Self-defence-

36:25.542 --> 36:27.658
Not that I think I'll need it-

36:27.742 --> 36:29.573
He'll be dead before nightfall-

36:29.662 --> 36:32.130
- Who will be?
- Dandrige-

36:32.222 --> 36:36.010
I'm waiting for the guy he lives with to
leave, then I'm gonna find his coffin---

36:36.102 --> 36:37.979
and pound this
through his heart-

36:39.422 --> 36:40.980
That's murder, Charley-

36:43.262 --> 36:45.730
You can't murder a vampire, Amy-

36:45.822 --> 36:48.382
They're dead- Remember?

36:50.462 --> 36:53.260
Listen-
I just taped this-

36:56.622 --> 36:58.533
Amy-

36:58.622 --> 37:00.453
What are we gonna do?

37:00.542 --> 37:02.533
This is just like Fright Night.

37:02.622 --> 37:06.535
Now for the news. Another young woman's
body was discovered this morning...

37:06.622 --> 37:08.453
in back of the Sheridan Mall--

37:08.542 --> 37:10.134
I don't have any choice-

37:11.142 --> 37:13.133
Somebody has to stop him-

37:14.822 --> 37:17.655
It's gonna be dangerous
going into that house all alone-

37:20.462 --> 37:22.896
You'll need all the help
you can get-

37:23.582 --> 37:25.891
Somebody like Peter Vincent,
for instance?

37:25.982 --> 37:27.335
I tried him already-

37:28.502 --> 37:31.221
Well, let us try again
before you do anything-

37:31.302 --> 37:33.691
There's not enough time, Amy-

37:33.782 --> 37:36.580
Well, what happens
if you go into that house alone---

37:36.662 --> 37:38.380
and he gets you?

37:38.462 --> 37:40.293
Who's gonna stop him then?

37:40.382 --> 37:44.500
Yeah- Then he'll be able to suck his way
through the entire town-

37:45.782 --> 37:48.171
Not that it would be
much of a loss-

37:48.262 --> 37:50.571
Charley, it's gonna be dark soon-

37:52.142 --> 37:54.940
You don't want to go
into that house then, do you?

37:55.022 --> 37:57.331
No, you're right there-

38:01.662 --> 38:04.222
- All right, try him again-
- Great-

38:04.302 --> 38:07.578
You promise you're not gonna
do anything till you hear from us?

38:10.022 --> 38:11.421
Okay- Come on-

38:14.142 --> 38:16.292
You don't believe me,
do you?

38:17.982 --> 38:19.700
I love you, Charley-

38:19.782 --> 38:21.181
Hey, Amy, come on!

38:38.982 --> 38:40.051
Yes?

38:40.142 --> 38:43.100
Mr Vincent,
could we talk to you for a moment?

38:43.182 --> 38:46.015
I'm afraid now
is not the best time-

38:46.102 --> 38:48.741
Please-
It's very important-

38:52.102 --> 38:53.660
Well, if you would just---

38:53.742 --> 38:56.575
wait there for one moment--

38:57.942 --> 38:59.136
Come in!

39:01.942 --> 39:04.251
What can I do for you?

39:05.702 --> 39:07.101
An autograph, perhaps?

39:08.662 --> 39:11.540
Perhaps an interview
for your school newspaper?

39:11.622 --> 39:13.817
I'm afraid this is
much more important-

39:15.382 --> 39:16.735
Really?

39:18.902 --> 39:21.780
What could be more important
than my autograph?

39:21.862 --> 39:23.454
Saving a boy's life-

39:24.302 --> 39:25.781
Oh- Yes-

39:25.862 --> 39:29.571
I can see where that
could be more important-

39:29.662 --> 39:33.780
Perhaps you would care to explain-

39:34.982 --> 39:37.780
Remember a fruitcake kid
named Charley Brewster?

39:37.862 --> 39:39.215
He said he saw you-

39:40.582 --> 39:43.221
The one who believes
a vampire lives next to him-

39:43.302 --> 39:45.941
Oh, yes-
You know, he is insane-

39:47.342 --> 39:49.173
Oh, my dear---

39:49.262 --> 39:51.696
I do hope he's not
a friend of yours-

39:51.782 --> 39:54.819
Yeah, she's got the hots
for the creep-

39:54.902 --> 39:56.130
Amy!

39:56.222 --> 39:58.417
We need your help to stop him-

39:58.502 --> 40:01.175
He really believes
his next-door neighbour is a vampire---

40:01.262 --> 40:03.218
and he's planning to kill him-

40:03.302 --> 40:05.611
With a stake through the heart-

40:08.022 --> 40:09.978
Are you two serious?

40:11.142 --> 40:12.495
Oh, my dear-

40:12.582 --> 40:15.858
Your friend needs a psychiatrist,
not a vampire killer-

40:15.942 --> 40:18.502
- Please, Mr Vincent-
- I'm afraid not-

40:18.582 --> 40:21.540
You see, Hollywood beckons-

40:21.622 --> 40:25.979
I have just been offered
a starring role in a major film-

40:26.062 --> 40:28.974
I have even had to quit
Fright Night.

40:29.062 --> 40:31.053
- I'll give you money-
- How much?

40:31.142 --> 40:33.053
I have a $500 savings bond-

40:33.142 --> 40:34.336
I'll take it-

40:36.102 --> 40:41.460
Now, how are we going to cure
your little friend---

40:41.542 --> 40:43.339
of this delusion?

40:44.102 --> 40:45.933
I got it all figured out-

40:46.022 --> 40:48.377
We all go next door
to the neighbour---

40:48.462 --> 40:51.499
and you perform some kind of
vampire test on him---

40:51.582 --> 40:53.538
to pronounce him human-

40:53.622 --> 40:57.092
You know-
Like in Orgy of the Damned?

40:57.182 --> 40:59.980
Where you looked in the mirror---

41:00.062 --> 41:04.772
the guy didn't have a reflection,
so then you knew he was a vampire-

41:05.902 --> 41:07.301
Oh, yes-

41:09.702 --> 41:12.057
That was one
of my favourite roles-

41:15.582 --> 41:18.050
Do you know---

41:18.142 --> 41:19.973
I still---

41:21.022 --> 41:22.853
have the prop-

41:53.702 --> 41:54.737
It's for you-

42:01.782 --> 42:03.613
Yes, this is Jerry Dandrige-

42:06.742 --> 42:09.051
I see-

42:09.142 --> 42:10.495
Well, yes, of course-

42:10.582 --> 42:13.574
I'm always willing
to help young people---

42:13.662 --> 42:16.654
but I'm afraid that crosses
are out of the question-

42:16.742 --> 42:20.701
You see,
I've been reborn recently-

42:20.782 --> 42:22.613
He's a reborn Christian-

42:22.702 --> 42:24.977
He thinks crosses
would be sacrilegious-

42:25.062 --> 42:28.941
- Ask him how he feels about holy water-
- How about holy water?

42:29.022 --> 42:30.421
No- Won't do either-

42:30.502 --> 42:33.938
Tell him it's ordinary tap water-
All he has to do is sip it-

42:37.542 --> 42:40.136
Oh, yes- Yes- Okay-
That sounds fine-

42:40.222 --> 42:44.454
But don't bring him over
until 6:00 tomorrow-

42:44.542 --> 42:46.533
I'll be out until then-

42:50.142 --> 42:53.134
Seems we don't have to go out
tonight after all-

42:53.222 --> 42:57.420
His friends are bringing him over
tomorrow night---

42:57.502 --> 42:59.572
to prove to him that I'm not---

43:00.582 --> 43:01.981
a vampire-

43:06.342 --> 43:09.140
It's 6:10- He said
he was gonna be here at 6:00-

43:09.222 --> 43:11.531
He said he'd be here-
He'll be here-

43:12.582 --> 43:13.935
Here he comes!

43:20.382 --> 43:23.215
Thank you-
Charley Brewster, I presume-

43:23.302 --> 43:25.133
Peter Vincent, vampire killer-

43:25.222 --> 43:28.294
I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate this-

43:28.382 --> 43:30.213
Good evening-
Now, down to business-

43:30.302 --> 43:34.454
Where is the lair of the suspected
creature of the night?

43:34.542 --> 43:35.611
There-

43:37.462 --> 43:39.293
Oh, yes-
I see what you mean-

43:40.342 --> 43:43.254
There is
a distinct possibility-

43:44.502 --> 43:46.413
Now, shall we go?

43:46.502 --> 43:48.732
Wait-
Where's your stakes and hammers?

43:48.822 --> 43:50.733
I left them in my bag-

43:50.822 --> 43:52.699
You're not going in there
without them-

43:52.782 --> 43:56.900
But I have to prove that he is a vampire
before I kill him, Charley-

43:56.982 --> 43:59.576
Look, I know he's a vampire!

43:59.662 --> 44:02.460
I am the one
who has to know, Charley-

44:02.542 --> 44:04.419
How are you gonna do that?

44:05.222 --> 44:06.780
This is holy water-

44:06.862 --> 44:09.296
If a drop touches him,
he will blister-

44:09.382 --> 44:11.612
I have asked him to drink it---

44:11.702 --> 44:14.262
while we all watch-

44:14.342 --> 44:15.821
He readily agreed-

44:15.902 --> 44:19.212
But if I'm right and you prove
he is a vampire---

44:19.302 --> 44:20.576
he'll kill us all-

44:20.662 --> 44:22.414
No, he won't, Charley-

44:22.502 --> 44:25.494
After all, I am here to protect you,
and I am Peter Vincent!

44:25.582 --> 44:27.459
I know, Mr Vincent, but--

44:28.582 --> 44:30.015
Hey! Peter Vincent-

44:31.182 --> 44:32.820
Billy Cole-

44:32.902 --> 44:33.857
This is a pleasure-

44:35.062 --> 44:36.893
Won't you all come in?

44:41.862 --> 44:43.261
And Charley-

44:50.702 --> 44:53.535
Hey,Jer! They're here-

44:55.342 --> 44:57.617
Perhaps he didn't hear you-

44:57.702 --> 44:59.932
He heard me, all right-

45:20.422 --> 45:21.616
Mr Vincent-

45:22.662 --> 45:24.175
I've seen all your films---

45:24.262 --> 45:26.981
and I've found them---

45:27.062 --> 45:28.256
very amusing-

45:28.342 --> 45:30.412
Oh- Thank you-

45:31.982 --> 45:33.859
And who are these two---

45:34.982 --> 45:37.542
attractive young people?

45:38.582 --> 45:40.413
Ed Thompson-

45:41.622 --> 45:43.294
Amy Peterson-

46:03.062 --> 46:04.256
Charmed-

46:07.662 --> 46:10.415
Isn't that what vampires
are supposed to do, Charley?

46:11.502 --> 46:14.016
- Please-
- That's some vampire, Brewster-

46:15.102 --> 46:16.740
God, he's neat-

46:26.662 --> 46:29.938
Please excuse the mess-
I haven't finished unpacking-

46:30.022 --> 46:32.695
Where do you keep your coffin?
Or do you have more than one?

46:32.782 --> 46:34.261
Charley!

46:34.342 --> 46:36.412
It's all right, Mr Vincent-

46:36.502 --> 46:39.255
I'm quite used to it by now-

46:39.342 --> 46:43.096
As you may or may not know, Charley even
brought the police over a few days ago-

46:43.182 --> 46:44.615
Charley, you didn't!

46:44.702 --> 46:48.536
Damn right I did- Only they didn't
believe me any more than any of you-

46:49.862 --> 46:51.056
But you'll believe me soon-

46:51.142 --> 46:53.019
Give him the holy water-

46:54.822 --> 46:57.461
Charley, there's no reason
to be rude about this-

46:57.542 --> 47:00.056
It's perfectly all right,
Mr Vincent-

47:02.182 --> 47:04.013
Where is it?

47:09.862 --> 47:13.377
And are you sure
that this is holy water?

47:14.382 --> 47:15.451
Positive-

47:16.502 --> 47:19.300
I saw Father Scanlon
bless it myself-

47:21.062 --> 47:23.417
Get ready to run-
I'll protect you-

47:34.262 --> 47:35.615
Bottoms up-

47:50.382 --> 47:51.610
There-

47:51.702 --> 47:53.135
Satisfied?

47:53.982 --> 47:55.734
Totally-

47:57.582 --> 48:00.335
Well, now, Charley,
you saw that-

48:00.422 --> 48:04.973
Are you convinced now
that Mr Dandrige is not a vampire?

48:05.062 --> 48:06.734
It can't be-

48:06.822 --> 48:09.052
But, Charley, you saw it-

48:09.142 --> 48:13.215
You know as well as I do that
no vampire can drink blessed water-

48:14.662 --> 48:16.220
Then it wasn't blessed-

48:16.302 --> 48:18.418
Are you calling me a liar,
young man?

48:19.542 --> 48:21.772
If he's not a vampire---

48:21.862 --> 48:23.215
have him touch this-

48:27.302 --> 48:29.611
You've made
a fool of yourself once-

48:29.702 --> 48:32.421
There's no reason
to compound the error-

48:32.502 --> 48:35.460
You've already caused your friends
quite enough pain-

48:40.942 --> 48:44.730
You wouldn't want to cause them
any more, would you?

48:59.822 --> 49:01.653
No, of course not-

49:01.742 --> 49:05.337
Then you're finally convinced
I'm not a vampire either?

49:05.422 --> 49:06.821
Right?

49:07.942 --> 49:09.136
Yes-

49:09.222 --> 49:12.578
Well, I'm glad that's settled-

49:13.782 --> 49:17.138
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, Mr Vincent-

49:17.222 --> 49:20.020
- You've been a great help-
- Glad to be of service-

49:20.102 --> 49:24.095
It was very nice meeting both of you-
Feel free to drop by anytime-

49:24.182 --> 49:26.412
You'll always be welcome-

49:26.502 --> 49:28.652
I'd like that, Mr Dandrige-

49:28.742 --> 49:30.255
Please call me Jerry-

49:30.342 --> 49:32.253
Let's get out of here-

49:32.342 --> 49:34.492
That goes for you too, Ed-

49:34.582 --> 49:37.858
I expect we have a lot of the same
interests-- horror movies, the occult-

49:41.222 --> 49:43.258
Something wrong, Mr Vincent?

49:44.502 --> 49:46.970
I just felt a little--

49:51.062 --> 49:53.656
It was just my clumsiness-

49:56.022 --> 49:57.375
Are you sure?

49:58.462 --> 49:59.861
I'm positive-

49:59.942 --> 50:02.740
We have been taking up
much too much of your time-

50:02.822 --> 50:05.655
Thank you so much-
Come along now, everybody-

50:07.142 --> 50:08.973
Thank you- Bye-bye-

50:12.422 --> 50:14.731
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing-

50:14.822 --> 50:17.620
- Then why are you shaking?
- I'm not shaking-

50:17.702 --> 50:21.377
You saw something that convinced you
he was a vampire, didn't you?

50:21.462 --> 50:24.260
- Of course not!
- Please, Mr Vincent-

50:24.342 --> 50:26.333
You have to tell me-

50:26.422 --> 50:27.775
All right!

50:29.862 --> 50:32.251
He didn't cast a reflection
in my mirror-

50:33.382 --> 50:36.340
- Satisfied now?
- You have to call the police!

50:36.422 --> 50:37.821
Shit!

50:39.302 --> 50:42.100
Where are you goin',
pencil dick?

50:42.182 --> 50:43.376
- Home!
- No way-

50:43.462 --> 50:45.532
We walk Amy home first-

50:48.182 --> 50:50.650
Looks just like her,
doesn't she?

50:56.742 --> 50:57.811
One good thing--

50:58.822 --> 51:00.699
they'll never believe him now-

51:07.102 --> 51:08.581
No?

51:14.582 --> 51:16.413
- Let's cut through here-
- No way!

51:16.502 --> 51:19.539
We want people and lights-
The more, the better-

51:19.622 --> 51:22.819
Listen, Brewster,
vampires don't exist-

51:22.902 --> 51:24.733
Haven't you figured that out yet?

51:24.822 --> 51:26.813
What if you're wrong, Evil?

51:26.902 --> 51:29.700
What if Dandrige is a vampire
and he thinks you know it?

51:29.782 --> 51:32.740
Would you walk down
that alley then?

51:34.502 --> 51:36.857
Oh, fuck you, Brewster-

51:36.942 --> 51:39.410
Evil, just stick with us,
all right?

51:39.502 --> 51:42.300
Forget it!
You may be chicken shit, but I'm not-

51:44.662 --> 51:46.493
- What'll we do?
- Let him go-

51:46.582 --> 51:49.858
No vampire's gonna want him anyway-
Probably give him blood poisoning-

51:55.942 --> 51:57.853
Jesus! I warned him!

51:57.942 --> 52:00.740
He got me, Charley!
He bit me!

52:02.022 --> 52:05.458
You know what you're gonna
have to do now, don't you?

52:05.542 --> 52:07.055
Kill me-

52:07.142 --> 52:08.734
Kill me, Charley---

52:08.822 --> 52:11.780
before I turn into a vampire---

52:11.862 --> 52:13.739
and give you a hickey!

52:15.702 --> 52:17.260
You asshole!

52:19.062 --> 52:22.020
You really believed me,
you poor dope!

52:22.102 --> 52:23.501
You'll get yours someday-

52:23.582 --> 52:26.699
Oh, yeah? When?
When I'm bit by a vampire?

52:26.782 --> 52:30.252
There are no such things
as vampires, fruitcake!

53:16.502 --> 53:18.379
Charley, Amy, is that you?

53:24.342 --> 53:26.617
It's not working-
I'm not scared-

54:43.542 --> 54:44.861
Hello, Edward-

54:47.342 --> 54:49.731
You don't have to be
afraid of me-

54:51.102 --> 54:52.854
I know what it's like
being different-

54:54.462 --> 54:56.692
Only they won't
pick on you any more---

54:57.622 --> 54:58.771
or beat you up-

55:00.702 --> 55:01.976
I'll see to that-

55:04.062 --> 55:06.530
All you have to do
is take my hand-

55:07.582 --> 55:08.651
Here, Edward-

55:08.742 --> 55:10.619
Take my hand-

55:33.502 --> 55:35.299
What was that?

55:38.382 --> 55:40.850
Just Evil
messing around again-

55:40.942 --> 55:44.935
Cut it out, Evil!
It's not funny!

55:45.022 --> 55:48.298
Amy, what if Evil
was really in trouble?

55:48.382 --> 55:51.692
You're not gonna let him
sucker you in again, are you?

56:01.902 --> 56:05.178
Don't tell me
this is a power outage-

56:05.262 --> 56:07.253
Well, what else would it be?

56:56.182 --> 56:58.138
Hey! You can't come in here!

57:10.342 --> 57:12.651
- Who are you calling?
- The police-

57:14.502 --> 57:15.537
Who is it?

57:15.622 --> 57:16.850
Me- Evil Ed-

57:16.942 --> 57:19.410
- What do you want?
- There's a vampire out here-

57:19.502 --> 57:20.981
Let me in-

57:26.782 --> 57:28.295
What are we going to do?

57:29.182 --> 57:31.901
What are you gonna do?

57:38.582 --> 57:40.140
Not me!

57:49.382 --> 57:52.613
I used to admire you-
You know that?

57:52.702 --> 57:54.613
But, of course---

57:54.702 --> 57:56.533
that was before---

57:56.622 --> 57:59.739
I found out
what a fake you were!

57:59.822 --> 58:01.938
Peter Vincent---

58:02.022 --> 58:03.899
the great vampire killer!

58:31.942 --> 58:34.410
What have you done to me?

58:34.502 --> 58:35.696
Back!

58:41.182 --> 58:44.060
The master will kill you
for this-

58:44.142 --> 58:46.372
But not fast-

58:46.462 --> 58:49.932
Slowly- Oh, so slowly-

58:50.022 --> 58:51.171
Back-

58:52.542 --> 58:54.373
I say back!

59:00.862 --> 59:02.739
He doesn't believe me!

59:02.822 --> 59:07.179
I'm scared, Charley-
I'm really scared-

59:07.262 --> 59:10.015
I am not going to let him
get you, Amy-

59:11.062 --> 59:12.893
I promise-

59:14.502 --> 59:16.652
You got Peter Vincent's number?

59:16.742 --> 59:21.736
He doesn't care about us!
I paid him to be there today-

59:21.822 --> 59:24.495
It doesn't matter, Amy-

59:24.582 --> 59:28.291
We don't have any choice-
Now give me his number-

01:00:49.222 --> 01:00:51.213
Look, you've gotta help us-

01:00:51.302 --> 01:00:53.770
Dandrige has me and Amy
trapped in this club downtown-

01:00:53.862 --> 01:00:55.500
No, Charley- I'm sorry-

01:00:55.582 --> 01:00:57.459
I just can't do that-

01:00:57.542 --> 01:01:01.171
You've gotta come- You're the only one
who knows what's going on-

01:03:37.702 --> 01:03:39.579
Let her go-

01:03:47.502 --> 01:03:49.811
Filthy son of a bitch!

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:56.613
Shouldn't lose
your temper, Charley-

01:03:58.462 --> 01:03:59.975
It isn't polite-

01:04:00.062 --> 01:04:02.371
You can't kill me here-

01:04:03.422 --> 01:04:06.732
I don't wanna kill you, Charley-

01:04:06.822 --> 01:04:09.655
I want you to bring Peter Vincent
to my house--just the two of you-

01:04:09.742 --> 01:04:13.974
That is, if you ever want
to see Amy again-

01:04:22.542 --> 01:04:24.612
- Let her go!
- I got him-

01:04:24.702 --> 01:04:27.341
- She's mine-
- You want chicken, go someplace else-

01:04:27.422 --> 01:04:29.333
- Out of my way-
- Move me-

01:04:33.742 --> 01:04:35.334
Leon!

01:05:51.902 --> 01:05:54.939
- Peter, open the door!
- Who is it?

01:05:55.022 --> 01:05:56.933
It's me- Charley Brewster-
Let me in-

01:05:59.542 --> 01:06:02.295
- Are you one of them?
- What are you talking about?

01:06:02.382 --> 01:06:05.772
Here- Grab this-

01:06:11.822 --> 01:06:13.494
Come on-

01:06:14.502 --> 01:06:16.299
We don't have very much time-

01:06:16.382 --> 01:06:18.691
Dandrige chased me and Amy
all over town-

01:06:18.782 --> 01:06:21.216
He trapped us in a nightclub-

01:06:22.262 --> 01:06:24.492
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving-

01:06:24.582 --> 01:06:26.652
- You can't!
-Just watch me-

01:06:26.742 --> 01:06:28.937
But Dandrige has Amy!

01:06:29.022 --> 01:06:31.092
He's gonna kill her
unless we come to his house-

01:06:31.182 --> 01:06:34.618
Oh, my God- The police-
I'll call the police-

01:06:34.702 --> 01:06:37.933
No, Peter- No!
They won't believe you- I've tried-

01:06:39.022 --> 01:06:41.616
Peter, it's just us-

01:06:42.822 --> 01:06:45.256
We're gonna have to save Amy-

01:06:45.342 --> 01:06:47.219
I can't-

01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:55.895
l---

01:06:58.782 --> 01:07:01.899
was paid to be there today-

01:07:01.982 --> 01:07:03.859
I know-

01:07:04.822 --> 01:07:06.653
And you still want me
to help you?

01:07:06.742 --> 01:07:09.051
Yes!

01:07:09.142 --> 01:07:12.771
You're Peter Vincent,
the great vampire killer!

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:15.171
That is a character in a movie!

01:07:16.742 --> 01:07:18.698
That isn't even my real name-

01:07:18.782 --> 01:07:21.171
I'm terrified-

01:07:23.182 --> 01:07:25.491
I'm sorry, Charley, but I am-

01:07:30.862 --> 01:07:34.298
I can't do it alone, Peter-

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:38.778
If you don't help,
Amy is gonna die-

01:07:38.862 --> 01:07:40.693
Me too, probably-

01:07:43.742 --> 01:07:45.619
Please, Peter-

01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:52.701
I'm sorry, Charley-

01:08:31.102 --> 01:08:34.981
She's someone I knew
a long time ago-

01:08:48.942 --> 01:08:50.533
Where am I?

01:08:54.341 --> 01:08:56.139
Where's Charley?

01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:00.416
Where?

01:11:42.422 --> 01:11:44.890
Peter Vincent-
Ready to do battle with the undead-

01:11:44.982 --> 01:11:46.381
This is serious-

01:11:46.462 --> 01:11:49.260
I am serious- Here-
Hold this- Go on-

01:11:52.902 --> 01:11:55.052
Let's see-
Flashlight, stakes, hammer-

01:11:55.142 --> 01:11:56.973
Ah, yes- Cross-

01:11:57.062 --> 01:11:59.257
What about Billy Cole?
How are you gonna stop him?

01:11:59.342 --> 01:12:02.414
I'm going to use this-
It is from Orgy of the Damned.

01:12:02.502 --> 01:12:05.892
What if he's not human?
Bullets aren't gonna stop him then-

01:12:05.982 --> 01:12:08.780
He walks around in the daylight,
now, doesn't he?

01:12:08.862 --> 01:12:10.215
- Hmm?
- Yeah-

01:12:10.302 --> 01:12:13.533
Well, then-
He is human- Come on-

01:12:13.622 --> 01:12:15.419
You don't have to do this-

01:12:15.502 --> 01:12:17.333
- I want to thank you--
- Not now-

01:12:23.182 --> 01:12:25.013
What's wrong?

01:12:26.622 --> 01:12:29.500
Nothing- Nothing at all-

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:35.816
Are you crazy?

01:12:35.902 --> 01:12:37.699
Not the front door-

01:12:37.782 --> 01:12:39.738
Let's go around the back
and sneak in-

01:12:45.422 --> 01:12:47.253
Too late-

01:12:50.582 --> 01:12:53.892
I am Peter Vincent---

01:12:53.982 --> 01:12:55.813
the great vampire killer-

01:13:15.982 --> 01:13:17.813
This way-

01:13:31.902 --> 01:13:33.733
Did you hear something?

01:13:35.342 --> 01:13:36.741
No-

01:13:38.462 --> 01:13:41.818
Let's come back at dawn-
You see, he'll be asleep then-

01:13:41.902 --> 01:13:43.893
We'll have a better chance
of getting Amy-

01:13:43.982 --> 01:13:47.418
And Amy will be dead by then too-
Now come on-

01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:08.255
Welcome to Fright Night.

01:14:18.262 --> 01:14:20.173
For real-

01:14:21.342 --> 01:14:22.741
Where's Amy?

01:14:22.822 --> 01:14:25.097
Up here-

01:14:25.182 --> 01:14:27.571
All you have to do
is get by me-

01:14:31.182 --> 01:14:33.776
Back, spawn of Satan!

01:14:38.902 --> 01:14:41.052
Oh, really?

01:14:57.622 --> 01:15:00.182
You have to have faith---

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:02.378
for this to work on me---

01:15:02.462 --> 01:15:04.453
Mr Vincent-

01:15:12.022 --> 01:15:14.217
Stop!

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:15.337
Back-

01:15:25.022 --> 01:15:26.614
We're gonna make it-

01:15:49.622 --> 01:15:51.419
Mrs Brewster!

01:15:56.862 --> 01:15:58.853
Operator, get me the--

01:16:07.182 --> 01:16:09.491
Thank God-
The phone wires have been cut-

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.301
I know-

01:16:16.342 --> 01:16:18.173
I did it!

01:16:20.182 --> 01:16:22.013
Where is Charley's mother?

01:16:27.302 --> 01:16:32.012
Well, apparently
she's working nights-

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:35.820
But she left a note-

01:16:45.302 --> 01:16:49.341
His dinner's in the oven!

01:20:06.622 --> 01:20:08.977
You wanted her-
There she is-

01:20:11.622 --> 01:20:14.375
Here- You're gonna need it-

01:20:14.462 --> 01:20:16.339
Just before dawn-

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:19.612
What have you done to her?

01:22:29.462 --> 01:22:31.657
I'm gonna have to break
the door down-

01:22:31.742 --> 01:22:33.733
You make as much noise
as you can.

01:22:35.782 --> 01:22:38.091
Help!

01:22:38.182 --> 01:22:40.138
Let me out!

01:22:41.542 --> 01:22:45.137
Please! Open the door!
Help! Somebody!

01:22:45.222 --> 01:22:48.578
I think she just opened her eyes-

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:56.299
All right- Grab her-
Let's get out of here-

01:22:56.382 --> 01:22:58.691
We can't- Look-

01:23:02.462 --> 01:23:04.054
Oh, my God-

01:23:06.782 --> 01:23:08.613
Something wrong?

01:23:08.702 --> 01:23:12.092
Yes- We have a visitor-

01:23:13.702 --> 01:23:15.932
Is it too late to save her?

01:23:16.022 --> 01:23:17.421
No-

01:23:18.582 --> 01:23:21.415
Not if we kill Dandrige
before dawn-

01:23:22.462 --> 01:23:24.100
Are you sure?

01:23:24.182 --> 01:23:26.491
So far, everything has been
like it was in movies-

01:23:26.582 --> 01:23:29.142
Now we just have to keep hoping-

01:23:32.022 --> 01:23:33.853
Let's go-

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:50.300
Well, what do we have here?

01:23:52.182 --> 01:23:53.979
Vampire killers?

01:23:58.222 --> 01:23:59.655
Stop or I'll shoot-

01:24:01.622 --> 01:24:02.850
I mean it-

01:24:02.942 --> 01:24:04.853
Don't force me to shoot-

01:24:17.062 --> 01:24:18.097
Stop!

01:24:20.862 --> 01:24:22.375
We have him-

01:24:25.742 --> 01:24:27.653
Do you?

01:24:32.062 --> 01:24:33.939
What did he mean by that?

01:24:34.982 --> 01:24:37.496
Nothing-
He was just bluffing-

01:26:38.342 --> 01:26:39.661
She's worse!

01:26:39.742 --> 01:26:42.131
Come on-
We're running out of time-

01:26:54.942 --> 01:26:56.819
Amy-

01:26:58.022 --> 01:26:59.375
Awake-

01:27:00.822 --> 01:27:03.734
I command you---

01:27:03.822 --> 01:27:07.610
to awake!

01:27:14.022 --> 01:27:18.891
Show me how much
you love me, Amy-

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:22.291
Kill them---

01:27:23.382 --> 01:27:24.974
both!

01:27:32.062 --> 01:27:33.780
He's on the roof-

01:27:33.862 --> 01:27:35.693
I'm going up there-

01:28:05.422 --> 01:28:07.572
He's not up here-

01:28:07.662 --> 01:28:09.459
Look out!

01:28:11.902 --> 01:28:13.779
He's going downstairs-

01:28:26.702 --> 01:28:29.774
So-

01:28:42.102 --> 01:28:43.251
Stay back-

01:28:48.302 --> 01:28:49.451
Back-

01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:04.011
You have to have faith
for that to work---

01:29:04.102 --> 01:29:07.139
Mr Vincent!

01:29:07.222 --> 01:29:09.338
Remember?

01:29:50.822 --> 01:29:55.896
You're out of time,
Mr Dandrige-

01:29:55.982 --> 01:29:57.938
Look over your shoulder-

01:30:10.422 --> 01:30:11.741
Back!

01:30:51.182 --> 01:30:53.776
- Are you all right?
- Yeah- Quick- He's in the basement-

01:31:04.142 --> 01:31:06.895
Quick- His coffin has got to be
down here somewhere-

01:31:24.822 --> 01:31:26.301
What was that?

01:31:26.382 --> 01:31:28.976
You keep searching-
I'll check it out-

01:31:45.342 --> 01:31:46.980
Amy?

01:31:47.062 --> 01:31:49.098
It's me-

01:31:49.182 --> 01:31:50.376
I know-

01:32:09.942 --> 01:32:11.375
I found it-

01:32:13.222 --> 01:32:15.178
Don't be frightened, Charley-

01:32:15.262 --> 01:32:16.934
Hurry- Get it open!

01:32:17.022 --> 01:32:18.455
He's locked it
from the inside-

01:32:20.102 --> 01:32:21.421
What's wrong?

01:32:23.902 --> 01:32:27.212
Don't you want me any more?

01:32:33.462 --> 01:32:36.579
It's not my fault, Charley-

01:32:36.662 --> 01:32:40.814
You promised
you wouldn't let him get me!

01:32:40.902 --> 01:32:43.052
You promised!

01:34:23.542 --> 01:34:25.294
Charley, watch out!

01:35:27.582 --> 01:35:29.300
Amy!

01:37:13.502 --> 01:37:15.936
Look! We've been
going in a circle.

01:37:16.022 --> 01:37:18.058
We're right back
where we started from.

01:37:18.142 --> 01:37:22.499
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fright Night Theatre.

01:37:22.582 --> 01:37:24.698
This is Peter Vincent...

01:37:24.782 --> 01:37:27.615
back once more with you...

01:37:27.702 --> 01:37:30.091
as host of Fright Night-

01:37:30.182 --> 01:37:34.892
I thought I'd let the vampires
rest for a little while.

01:37:37.502 --> 01:37:38.901
Right, Charley?

01:37:40.382 --> 01:37:44.375
Tonight, the threat comes
not from beyond the grave...

01:37:44.462 --> 01:37:47.420
but from beyond the stars...

01:37:47.502 --> 01:37:51.495
as alien beings stalk
an unwary summer camp...

01:37:51.582 --> 01:37:55.211
in Mars Wants Flesh-

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:58.135
I do not star in it.

01:38:19.862 --> 01:38:21.261
Is something wrong?

01:38:26.262 --> 01:38:28.139
Nothing-

01:38:46.222 --> 01:38:49.020
Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!
