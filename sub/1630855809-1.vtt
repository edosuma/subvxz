WEBVTT

00:29.083 --> 00:31.625
<i>Hmm. Yes.</i>

00:32.583 --> 00:35.750
<i>Well, here we are now
in the hut where I write.</i>

00:37.000 --> 00:39.875
I've been in this hut for 30 years now.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.958
Well, it's important, uh, before I start,

00:42.958 --> 00:48.000
I like to make sure I have everything
around me that I'm going to need. Um...

00:48.000 --> 00:52.208
Cigarettes, of course.
Some coffee, chocolates.

00:53.958 --> 00:57.875
And always make sure
I have a sharp pencil before I start.

00:59.833 --> 01:03.458
I have six pencils,
and then I like to clean my writing board.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.083
See how many bits of rubber.

01:08.833 --> 01:09.666
There.

01:11.958 --> 01:13.875
And then, finally, one starts.

01:17.125 --> 01:20.708
It's, uh...
usually a few corrections needed.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.291
Yeah.

01:29.541 --> 01:30.375
It's, um...

01:34.250 --> 01:38.041
Henry Sugar was 41 years old,
unmarried and rich.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.625
He was rich because
he had a rich father who was now dead.

01:41.625 --> 01:45.791
Was unmarried because he was too selfish
to share any of his money with a wife.

01:45.791 --> 01:47.583
He was 6'2" tall,

01:47.583 --> 01:50.291
and not perhaps as handsome
as he thought he was.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.958
He paid a great deal
of attention to his clothes.

01:52.958 --> 01:55.250
He went
to an expensive tailor for his suits,

01:55.250 --> 01:58.666
to a shirt maker for his shirts,
and to a boot maker for his shoes.

01:58.666 --> 02:01.583
His hairdresser trimmed his hair
once every ten days,

02:01.583 --> 02:04.458
and he always took a manicure
at the same time.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.083
He drove a Ferrari motor car

02:06.083 --> 02:08.666
which cost him about the same
as a country cottage.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.583
All his friends were rich

02:11.583 --> 02:14.000
and he had never done
a day's work in his life.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.500
Men like Henry Sugar can be found
drifting like seaweed all over the world.

02:19.500 --> 02:23.291
They're not particularly bad men,
but they're not good men either.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.416
They're simply part of the decoration.

02:28.375 --> 02:30.625
All rich people
of Henry's type, of course,

02:30.625 --> 02:34.875
have one peculiarity in common:
a terrific urge to make themselves richer.

02:35.791 --> 02:38.625
The 10 million is never enough.
Nor is 20 million.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.583
Always they suffer
the insatiable longing for more money

02:41.583 --> 02:45.250
and the terror of waking up one morning
and finding nothing in the bank.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.541
They employ various methods
to increase their fortunes.

02:48.541 --> 02:51.333
Some buy stocks and shares,
watch them go up and down.

02:51.333 --> 02:56.333
Some buy land or art or diamonds.
Some bet on roulette, blackjack, horses.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.416
Some, indeed, bet on anything.

02:58.416 --> 03:02.541
Henry Sugar was one of those,
and not at all above cheating, by the way.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.458
One summer weekend,

03:04.458 --> 03:08.166
Henry drove from London to the countryside
to stay with Sir William W.

03:08.166 --> 03:10.583
The house was magnificent.
So were the grounds.

03:10.583 --> 03:14.166
But when Henry arrived that Saturday,
it was already pelting with rain.

03:14.166 --> 03:17.750
The host and his other guests
whiled away the afternoon playing games,

03:17.750 --> 03:21.708
while Henry glumly stared out at the drops
splashing against the windows.

03:21.708 --> 03:25.041
Henry wandered out of the drawing room
and into the front hall.

03:25.041 --> 03:29.375
He drifted through the house, aimless.
Then finally mooched into the library.

03:32.250 --> 03:35.916
Sir William's father was a book collector,
and the walls of this huge room

03:35.916 --> 03:39.291
were lined with antiquated
leather bound volumes floor-to-ceiling.

03:39.291 --> 03:40.708
Henry wasn't interested.

03:40.708 --> 03:44.166
He only read detective novels
and thrillers. Nothing like that here.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.333
He was about to leave

03:45.333 --> 03:48.500
when his eye was caught and held
by something quite different.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.458
So slim, he never would've noticed it

03:50.458 --> 03:53.541
if it hadn't been sticking out
from the books on either side.

03:53.541 --> 03:55.166
He pulled it from the shelf.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.291
It was nothing more

03:56.291 --> 03:59.166
than a cardboard exercise book,
the kind children use at school.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.833
The cover was dark blue,
with nothing written on it.

04:01.833 --> 04:05.750
On the first page, hand-printed
in black ink, clear and neat, it said:

04:08.666 --> 04:12.416
Strange. Weird. What is this?

04:13.291 --> 04:16.750
He settled himself into an armchair
and started from the beginning.

04:16.750 --> 04:20.708
The following is what Henry read
in the little, blue exercise book.

04:24.958 --> 04:28.916
My name is Z.Z. Chatterjee. Head surgeon
at Lords and Ladies Hospital, Calcutta.

04:28.916 --> 04:31.083
On the morning of 2nd December, 1935,

04:31.083 --> 04:33.291
I was in the doctors' rest room
having a cup of tea.

04:33.291 --> 04:36.916
Three other doctors were present with me.
Doctors Marshall, Mitra, and Macfarlane.

04:36.916 --> 04:38.500
- There was a knock.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.750
"Come in," I said.

04:41.458 --> 04:44.750
Excuse me, please.
May I ask you gentlemen a favor?

04:44.750 --> 04:46.500
"This is a private room," I said.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.750
I know. I'm sorry to burst in like this,

04:48.750 --> 04:51.791
but I have a most, I think,
interesting thing to show you.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.208
We were pretty annoyed
and didn't say anything.

04:55.208 --> 04:59.375
Gentlemen, I'm a man
who can see without using his eyes.

05:00.208 --> 05:01.666
He was a small man, about 60,

05:01.666 --> 05:05.375
white mustache and a matting of black hair
over the outsides of his ears.

05:05.375 --> 05:08.291
You may bandage my head
with 50 bandages in any way,

05:08.291 --> 05:10.500
and I'll still be able to read you a book.

05:10.500 --> 05:14.166
He seemed perfectly serious.
I felt my curiosity beginning to stir.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.250
Come in, please.

05:22.166 --> 05:25.791
All right. How many fingers
is Dr. Marshall holding up?

05:25.791 --> 05:27.291
- Seven.
-"Once more," I said.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.750
- Nine.
-"Once more," I said.

05:28.750 --> 05:29.833
- Three.
- Once more--

05:29.833 --> 05:31.291
- Three again.
- Once more.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.166
No fingers.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.333
Hmm. What's the trick?

05:36.333 --> 05:40.333
There's no trick. This is a genuine thing
I've managed after years of training.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.708
What sorts of training?

05:41.708 --> 05:44.208
Forgive me, sir,
but that is a private matter.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.291
What can we do for you?

05:46.291 --> 05:49.333
I work in a traveling theater.
We arrived in Calcutta today.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.791
Tonight we give our opening performance
at the Royal Palace Hall.

05:52.791 --> 05:54.375
I am billed on the program as:

05:54.375 --> 05:56.708
Imdad Khan,
the Man Who Sees without His Eyes.

05:56.708 --> 05:58.750
When our company arrives in a new town,

05:58.750 --> 06:00.250
I go to the largest hospital

06:00.250 --> 06:03.791
and ask the doctors to bandage my eyes
in the most thorough fashion.

06:03.791 --> 06:06.125
It is important this job
is done by doctors,

06:06.125 --> 06:08.208
otherwise people may think I'm cheating.

06:08.208 --> 06:11.041
Then I go out into the streets
and do a dangerous thing.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.333
I looked at the others.

06:12.333 --> 06:15.458
Mitra and Macfarlane
had to go back to their patients. Go on.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.541
- But Dr. Marshall said...
- Why not? Let's do the job properly.

06:18.541 --> 06:20.708
Make it absolutely certain
he can't see anything.

06:20.708 --> 06:23.208
You are kind. Please do whatever you wish.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.000
"Before we bandage him," I said,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.250
"fill his eye sockets
with something soft, solid."

06:27.250 --> 06:29.500
- Dough?
- Perfect. Go to the hospital bakery.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.375
I'll take him and seal his eyelids.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.916
I led Imdad down
the long corridor to the surgery.

06:33.916 --> 06:35.250
"Lie down there," I said.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.666
I took a bottle of collodion
from the cupboard.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.916
I'll glue your eyelids shut
with this stuff.

06:39.916 --> 06:41.291
How do I remove it later?

06:41.291 --> 06:44.833
Just dab some alcohol carefully
below the lashes. That'll dissolve it.

06:44.833 --> 06:47.583
Keep your eyes closed
while we wait for it to harden.

06:47.583 --> 06:48.625
Two minutes passed.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.041
"Open your eyes," I said. He couldn't.

06:51.041 --> 06:55.000
I took some of Dr. Marshall's dough
and plastered it over one of Imdad's eyes.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.333
I filled the whole socket

06:56.333 --> 06:59.000
and let the dough
overlap onto the surrounding skin.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.791
I did the same with the other eye.

07:00.791 --> 07:02.500
I pressed the edges down hard.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.416
-"Isn't too uncomfortable?" I asked.
-  Not at all. Thank you.

07:05.416 --> 07:07.458
"Do the bandaging," I said to Marshall.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.000
My fingers are too sticky.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.833
Pleasure. We'll just pop these here...

07:11.833 --> 07:15.333
Dr. Marshall laid thick cotton-wool
on Imdad's dough-filled eyes.

07:15.333 --> 07:16.375
It stuck in place.

07:16.375 --> 07:17.416
Sit up please.

07:18.125 --> 07:21.416
Dr. Marshall rolled a three-inch bandage
round the face and head.

07:21.416 --> 07:23.833
Please do leave
my nose free for breathing.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.083
Of course.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.500
Sorry, it's going to be
a pinch on the tight side.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.083
How's that?

07:32.083 --> 07:33.125
"Splendid," I said.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.708
Looked like he suffered
a terrible brain operation.

07:35.708 --> 07:36.666
How does it feel?

07:36.666 --> 07:37.833
It feels very good.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.916
I must compliment you gentlemen
on doing such a thorough job.

07:40.916 --> 07:44.166
Imdad Khan stood up off the bed
and walked straight to the door.

07:51.291 --> 07:54.458
Great Scott! See that?
He put his hand right on the doorknob!

07:54.458 --> 07:55.958
Dr. Marshall stopped grinning.

07:56.541 --> 07:59.583
Imdad was walking normally,
quite briskly along the corridor.

07:59.583 --> 08:03.000
We followed five yards behind him.
Spooky it was to watch this man

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
with an enormous,
totally bandaged head strolling casually...

08:06.000 --> 08:07.166
"He saw it!" I cried.

08:07.166 --> 08:09.875
"He saw that trolley!
This is unbelievable!"

08:09.875 --> 08:11.333
Dr. Marshall didn't answer.

08:11.333 --> 08:14.166
His whole face was rigid
with shocked disbelief.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.708
Imdad went down the stairs
with no trouble at all.

08:16.708 --> 08:18.208
Didn't even hold the stair-rail.

08:18.208 --> 08:21.166
Several people were coming up.
You can see how they reacted.

08:21.875 --> 08:25.750
At the bottom of the stairs, he turned
and headed out the doors to the street.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.166
Dr. Marshall and I kept close behind him.

08:28.166 --> 08:31.416
Below us, a crowd of 100
barefoot children shouted and surged

08:31.416 --> 08:33.166
towards our white-headed visitor.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.500
He greeted them
with his hands above his head.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.833
He walked to a bicycle,
mounted it, and pedaled a figure-eight.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.708
The barefoot children chased him,
cheering and laughing.

08:41.708 --> 08:44.583
He sped straight out
into the traffic of the busy street

08:44.583 --> 08:47.916
with honking motor-cars
whizzing around him in every direction.

08:47.916 --> 08:49.625
He rode superbly.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.708
For a minute, we kept him in sight.

08:51.708 --> 08:53.750
Then he turned a corner and was gone.

08:53.750 --> 08:57.375
-"I can't believe it," Dr. Marshall said.
- I can't believe it.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.958
"I can't either," I said.

08:58.958 --> 09:01.250
I think we just witnessed a miracle.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.875
For the rest of the day,
I was busy with patients.

09:03.875 --> 09:06.541
In the evening,
I went to my flat to change clothes.

09:06.541 --> 09:08.000
I took a long, cool shower.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.500
I drank whisky-soda on the veranda
with only a towel around my waist.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.416
At ten minutes to 7:00,
I arrived at the Royal Palace Hall.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.000
<i>The show lasted two hours.</i>

09:16.000 --> 09:19.458
To my surprise, I enjoyed it. The juggler,
the snake-charmer, the fire-eater,

09:19.458 --> 09:22.625
the sword-swallower who pushed a rapier
down his throat into his stomach.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.666
Lastly, to a great fanfare of trumpets,

09:24.666 --> 09:27.000
our friend Imdad Khan
came out to do his act.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.041
Members of the audience
were called onstage to blindfold him

09:30.041 --> 09:32.250
before he threw knives around a boy's body

09:32.250 --> 09:34.541
and shot a can off his head
with a revolver.

09:34.541 --> 09:38.458
Then, finally, a metal barrel was fitted
over his already bandaged head.

09:38.458 --> 09:42.291
The boy placed a needle in Imdad's hand
and some cotton thread in the other.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.708
A large magnifying glass
was placed in front of him,

09:44.708 --> 09:46.375
and with no false moves,

09:46.375 --> 09:49.458
he neatly threaded the thread
through the eye of the needle.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.208
I was flabbergasted.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.125
Backstage, I found Imdad
sitting quietly on a stool

10:00.125 --> 10:01.625
while he removed his stage makeup.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.416
You're curious, doctor, correct?

10:03.416 --> 10:04.666
"Most curious," I said.

10:04.666 --> 10:08.583
Again, I was struck by the matting
of black hair on the outsides of his ears.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.916
I'd never seen anything like it
on another person.

10:10.916 --> 10:13.458
I have a proposal:
I'm not a writer by profession.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.875
But if you tell me
how you developed this power

10:15.875 --> 10:18.833
of seeing without your eyes,
I'll take it down faithfully.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.833
I'll try to get it published
in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>

10:21.833 --> 10:23.125
or in a famous magazine.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.375
Would that help you?
To become better known?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.416
- It would help me very much.
- Splendid.

10:27.416 --> 10:30.333
I have a shorthand
for taking down medical histories.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.500
I believe I got everything
Imdad said to me, word for word.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.750
I give it to you now
exactly as he spoke it.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.791
I was born in Kashmir State in 1873.

10:45.791 --> 10:48.916
My father was a ticket inspector
on the national railway.

10:48.916 --> 10:52.291
One day, a conjurer came to our school
and gave a performance.

10:52.291 --> 10:53.833
I was spellbound.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.833
Two weeks later, I took all my savings

10:55.833 --> 10:58.375
and ran away
to join a traveling theater company.

10:58.375 --> 11:01.708
That was in 1886. I was 13 years old.

11:01.708 --> 11:02.791
For three years

11:02.791 --> 11:05.500
I traveled with this group
all over the Punjab.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.125
By the end of it,
I was playing top of the bill.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.666
All the time, I was saving money,

11:10.666 --> 11:14.541
which finally added up
to just over 3,000 rupees.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.625
At this moment,
I heard tell of a great, famous yogi

11:17.625 --> 11:19.958
who had acquired
the rare power of levitation.

11:19.958 --> 11:21.666
It was said that when he prayed,

11:21.666 --> 11:25.208
his whole body left the ground
and rose up 18 inches into the air.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.250
At the very least, a terrific effect.

11:28.375 --> 11:29.208
Mustache?

11:31.125 --> 11:33.208
- Oh. I quit the theater company...
-  Mmm-hmm.

11:33.208 --> 11:36.375
...and made my way to the small town
on the banks of the Ganges,

11:36.375 --> 11:38.375
where rumor said this yogi was living.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.833
One day,
I overheard a traveler mention a hermit

11:40.833 --> 11:44.583
he had encountered not so very far away,
in the densest jungle, all alone.

11:44.583 --> 11:45.958
That was enough for me.

11:45.958 --> 11:48.166
Um, I dashed out to hire a horse and cart.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.708
As I negotiated with the driver,

11:50.708 --> 11:53.291
a man appeared and said
he was going in the same direction,

11:53.291 --> 11:56.291
and suggested we share the ride
and split the cost.

11:56.291 --> 11:59.166
Well, what truly fantastic luck!

11:59.166 --> 12:00.541
Talking to my companion,

12:00.541 --> 12:03.625
I found that he was a disciple
of the great yogi himself,

12:03.625 --> 12:06.541
and on his way,
at that very moment, to visit his master.

12:06.541 --> 12:07.458
I blurted out,

12:07.458 --> 12:10.416
"This is the man I'm looking for!
Please, may I meet him?"

12:10.416 --> 12:13.291
My companion looked at me long and slow.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.458
"That is impossible," he said.

12:15.458 --> 12:18.750
From this point forward,
he refused to answer my questions.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.416
However, I managed
to learn one small thing:

12:21.416 --> 12:24.625
the time of day
the great yogi commenced his meditation.

12:24.625 --> 12:28.958
My companion signaled to halt the cart,
dismounted, and was gone.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.625
I pretended to drive on.
But just around the corner,

12:31.625 --> 12:33.875
I jumped down
and snuck back along the path.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.375
Already, the man
had disappeared into the jungle.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.750
- I heard a rustling in the undergrowth.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.125
"If that's not him," I thought,
"it's a tiger,

12:41.125 --> 12:43.750
and I'm about to be
pounced upon, thrashed,

12:43.750 --> 12:46.583
and eaten in little, torn morsels
of bloody flesh."

12:47.958 --> 12:49.125
It was him.

12:51.041 --> 12:54.791
<i>There wasn't even a shadow of a trace
of a path where the man was walking.</i>

12:54.791 --> 12:57.000
<i>He was pushing his way
between tall bamboos</i>

12:57.000 --> 12:58.875
<i>and every kind of heavy vegetation.</i>

12:58.875 --> 13:02.833
<i>I crept after him, very quiet,
keeping at least 100 yards behind.</i>

13:02.833 --> 13:05.916
<i>Whenever I lost sight of him,
which was most of the time,</i>

13:05.916 --> 13:08.458
<i>I was able to follow
the sound of his footsteps.</i>

13:08.458 --> 13:11.750
<i>For half an hour, this tense game
of follow-the-leader went on.</i>

13:11.750 --> 13:14.666
<i>Then, suddenly,
I no longer heard the man in front of me.</i>

13:14.666 --> 13:16.375
<i>I stopped and listened.</i>

13:16.375 --> 13:18.583
<i>All at once,
through the thick undergrowth,</i>

13:18.583 --> 13:21.166
<i>I saw a little clearing
and two small huts.</i>

13:21.166 --> 13:22.458
<i>My heart jumped.</i>

13:22.458 --> 13:24.833
<i>There was a water-hole
next to the nearest hut</i>

13:24.833 --> 13:26.916
<i>with a prayer-mat beside it, and above,</i>

13:26.916 --> 13:31.208
<i>a large baobab tree
with beautiful, thick, leafy branches.</i>

13:31.208 --> 13:33.583
All through
the great noontime heat, I waited.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.500
On through the heavy wet heat
of the afternoon, I waited.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.958
As five o'clock approached,

13:37.958 --> 13:41.416
I quietly climbed up my tree
and hid among the leaves.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.625
Finally, the great yogi
came out of his hut

13:43.625 --> 13:45.541
and sat cross-legged on the mat.

13:45.541 --> 13:48.208
Each movement he made was calm and gentle.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.791
He put his hands
palm downward on his knees

13:50.791 --> 13:53.041
and took a long breath
through his nostrils,

13:53.041 --> 13:56.875
and already I could see
a sort of brightness was melting over him.

13:56.875 --> 14:00.291
For 14 minutes, he remained
perfectly still in this position.

14:00.291 --> 14:04.000
And then, as I watched,
I saw, quite positively,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.166
his body slowly lifting off the ground.

14:07.666 --> 14:11.333
<i>Twelve inches. Fifteen. Eighteen. Twenty.</i>

14:12.083 --> 14:14.166
<i>Two feet above the prayer-mat.</i>

14:14.166 --> 14:15.958
<i>Up in the tree, I said to myself,</i>

14:15.958 --> 14:19.125
<i>"There before you
is a man sitting in the air."</i>

14:20.458 --> 14:24.416
Forty-six minutes, by my watch,
his body remained suspended.

14:24.416 --> 14:26.708
And then he slowly descended
back to earth,

14:26.708 --> 14:29.333
until his buttocks
rested again upon the mat.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.916
I climbed down from my tree
and ran straight over.

14:31.916 --> 14:34.291
The great yogi
was washing his hands and feet.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.583
"How long have you been here?"
he said sharply.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.208
Suddenly, he picked up a brick
and threw it at me so hard

14:39.208 --> 14:41.791
it broke in two
as it struck my leg below the knee.

14:41.791 --> 14:44.000
I have the scar still.
I'll show it to you.

14:46.916 --> 14:48.708
This was actually a stroke of luck.

14:48.708 --> 14:51.791
A great yogi isn't meant
to lose his temper and fling bricks.

14:51.791 --> 14:56.250
The old man was humiliated, remorseful,
and deeply disappointed in himself.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.625
He explained that though
he could not take me on as a disciple,

14:59.625 --> 15:02.541
he would, nevertheless,
give me some informal instruction

15:02.541 --> 15:04.708
in order to make amends for attacking me,

15:04.708 --> 15:07.125
an attack I fully deserved, by the way.

15:07.125 --> 15:09.041
This was in 1890.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.041
I was nearly 17 years old.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.250
Now, what was
the great yogi's instruction?

15:15.250 --> 15:16.875
Here it comes.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.458
The mind is a scattered thing.

15:18.458 --> 15:21.541
It concerns itself
with thousands of different items at once.

15:21.541 --> 15:24.250
Things you see around you.
Things you hear and smell.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.208
Things you think about.
Things you try not to think about.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.250
You must learn to concentrate such that

15:29.250 --> 15:32.916
you can visualize at will one item,
one item only, and nothing else.

15:32.916 --> 15:35.958
If you work hard, you may be able
to concentrate your conscious mind

15:35.958 --> 15:37.458
on any one object you select

15:37.458 --> 15:39.458
for around three and one-half minutes.

15:39.458 --> 15:42.625
This will take
about 20 years of diligent, daily effort.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.291
"Twenty years!" I cried.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.083
Twenty years. It may take longer.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.875
That's the usual time,
if you are able to do it at all.

15:48.875 --> 15:50.541
I'll be an old man by then!

15:50.541 --> 15:53.416
The time varies.
Some take ten years, some take thirty.

15:53.416 --> 15:56.333
On extremely rare occasions,
a special person comes along

15:56.333 --> 15:59.250
who's able to develop the power
in only one or two years,

15:59.250 --> 16:01.250
but this is one in a billion. Not you.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.625
Is it that difficult
to concentrate the mind--

16:03.625 --> 16:08.166
Almost impossible. Try it and see.
Shut your eyes and think of something.

16:08.166 --> 16:11.291
Think of just one object.
Visualize it. See it before you.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.458
In a few seconds, your mind will wander.

16:13.458 --> 16:16.541
Other thoughts will creep in.
It's a very difficult thing.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.625
Thus spoke the great, wise, old yogi.

16:20.708 --> 16:23.500
<i>And so my exercises began.</i>

16:24.083 --> 16:25.458
Each evening, I sat down,

16:25.458 --> 16:28.916
closed my eyes, and visualized the person
I loved best in the world,

16:28.916 --> 16:32.333
which was my elder brother
who died, age ten, from a blood disease.

16:32.333 --> 16:36.208
I concentrated on his face,
but the instant my mind began to wander,

16:36.208 --> 16:39.166
I stopped the exercise,
rested for several minutes,

16:39.166 --> 16:40.458
then I tried again.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.291
<i>After five years of daily practice,</i>

16:42.291 --> 16:45.208
<i>I was able to concentrate
absolutely on my brother's face</i>

16:45.208 --> 16:46.750
<i>for one and a half minutes.</i>

16:46.750 --> 16:48.166
<i>I was making progress.</i>

16:51.791 --> 16:52.625
In the meantime,

16:52.625 --> 16:55.833
I began to earn quite good money
giving conjuring performances.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.041
By nature,
my sleight-of-hand is very good,

16:58.041 --> 17:00.708
but always, I continued my exercises.

17:00.708 --> 17:04.583
Every evening, wherever I was,
I settled myself down in a quiet spot

17:04.583 --> 17:07.333
and concentrated my mind
on my brother's face.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.583
Sometimes, I lit a candle
and began by staring at the flame.

17:10.583 --> 17:14.041
A candle flame, as you know,
has three separate parts:

17:14.041 --> 17:16.541
the yellow at the top,
the mauve lower down,

17:16.541 --> 17:17.875
and the black inside.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.833
I placed the candle
16 inches away from my face,

17:20.833 --> 17:22.458
absolutely level with my eyes,

17:22.458 --> 17:25.708
so I didn't have to make
even tiny adjustments of my eye muscles

17:25.708 --> 17:26.916
by looking up or down.

17:26.916 --> 17:31.041
I stared at the black part in the center
until everything around me disappeared.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.458
Then I shut my eyes

17:32.458 --> 17:35.000
and began to concentrate
on my brother's face.

17:35.916 --> 17:40.750
By 1907, when I was 34 years old,
I could concentrate for three minutes

17:40.750 --> 17:43.125
without any wandering
of my mind whatsoever.

17:43.125 --> 17:46.458
It was also at this time
that I became aware of a slight ability,

17:46.458 --> 17:48.291
just a queer, little feeling,

17:48.291 --> 17:51.375
that when I closed my eyes
and looked at something hard,

17:51.375 --> 17:52.750
with fierce intensity,

17:52.750 --> 17:55.541
I could see the outline
of the object I was looking at.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.583
I thought of a thing the yogi had said:

17:57.583 --> 18:01.250
"Certain holy people have been known
to develop so great a concentration

18:01.250 --> 18:04.000
they can see without using their eyes."

18:04.000 --> 18:08.416
Each night after I performed
my exercises with the candle flame,

18:08.416 --> 18:11.333
I drank a cup of coffee,
then I blindfolded myself

18:11.333 --> 18:13.875
and sat in my chair
trying to see without my eyes.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.125
I started with a deck of playing cards.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.333
I studied the backs. I guessed the values.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.583
Immediately, I had a 60% success rate.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.833
Later, I bought maps
and navigational charts

18:22.833 --> 18:24.625
and pinned them up around my room.

18:24.625 --> 18:29.083
I spent hours looking at them blindfolded,
trying to read the small lettering.

18:29.083 --> 18:33.291
Every evening for the next eight years,
I proceeded with this kind of practice.

18:33.291 --> 18:36.000
By 1915,
I could read a book straight through,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.958
cover to cover, blindfolded.

18:37.958 --> 18:39.291
I had it!

18:39.291 --> 18:41.291
At last, I had this power.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.541
As you know,
it became my entire conjuring performance.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.791
Audiences loved it, but no one
believed it to be genuine. Still don't.

18:48.791 --> 18:52.333
Even doctors, like you, who blindfold me
in the most expert fashion,

18:52.333 --> 18:55.375
refuse to believe
anyone can see without his eyes.

18:55.375 --> 18:58.708
They forget there are other ways
of sending an image to the brain.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.208
Imdad Khan fell silent.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.208
He was tired.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.666
"What other ways?" I asked.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.333
Quite honestly, I do not know.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.958
The seeing is done
by another part of the body.

19:10.958 --> 19:12.458
Which part?

19:22.125 --> 19:23.666
That night I didn't go to bed.

19:23.666 --> 19:26.833
This man would have scientists
turning somersaults in the air.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.875
He must be the most valuable man alive.

19:28.875 --> 19:32.625
I had to find out exactly how it was,
biologically, chemically, magically,

19:32.625 --> 19:35.375
an image could be sent to the brain
without using the eyes.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.833
Blind people might be able to see.
Deaf people to hear. Who knows what else?

19:38.833 --> 19:41.541
"This incredible man
must not be ignored," I thought.

19:41.541 --> 19:45.333
I started transcribing with care
everything Imdad had told me that evening.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.416
I wrote for five hours without stopping.

19:50.125 --> 19:53.583
At eight o'clock the next morning,
I finished the most important part:

19:53.583 --> 19:55.041
the pages you've just read.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.958
I didn't see Dr. Marshall
until we met for our tea-break.

19:57.958 --> 20:00.291
I told him what I could
in the time we had.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.916
"Back to the theater tonight," I said.
Can't lose him now.

20:02.916 --> 20:04.291
I'll come with you.

20:04.291 --> 20:06.875
At 6:45,
we drove to the Royal Palace Hall.

20:06.875 --> 20:09.458
I parked the car,
and we walked to the theater.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.250
"There's something wrong," I said.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.625
There was no crowd,
and the doors were closed.

20:13.625 --> 20:17.666
The poster for the show was in place,
but someone had printed across it...

20:17.666 --> 20:19.833
"Tonight's performance canceled."

20:20.875 --> 20:24.208
I asked an old gatekeeper
by the locked doors: "What happened?"

20:24.208 --> 20:26.500
-  Someone died.
-"Who?"

20:26.500 --> 20:27.958
Of course, I already knew.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.583
The man who sees
without his eyes.

20:30.583 --> 20:32.208
"How?" I cried.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.708
He went to sleep
and never woke up.

20:35.208 --> 20:36.375
These things happen.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.416
We walked slowly back to the car.

20:46.125 --> 20:48.500
I felt an overwhelming sense
of grief and anger.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.583
I should never have allowed him
out of my sight.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.500
I should've given him my bed,
taken care of him.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.000
Imdad Khan was a maker of miracles.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.333
He'd communicated with mysterious forces
far beyond the reach of ordinary people.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.083
Now he was dead.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.833
"That's that," Dr. Marshall said.

21:02.625 --> 21:03.541
That's that.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.500
"Yes," I said.

21:06.833 --> 21:07.750
"That's that."

21:12.625 --> 21:15.083
This is a true and accurate report
of everything

21:15.083 --> 21:17.291
concerning my two meetings
with Imdad Khan.

21:20.416 --> 21:21.625
Well, well, well.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.791
Now that is extremely interesting.

21:26.166 --> 21:28.333
This is a terrific piece of information.

21:29.916 --> 21:31.333
This could change my life.

21:51.125 --> 21:53.541
The piece of information
Henry was referring to

21:53.541 --> 21:57.333
was that Imdad Khan had trained himself
to read the value of a playing-card

21:57.333 --> 21:58.833
from the reverse side,

21:58.833 --> 22:01.541
and, being,
as mentioned, a dishonest gambler,

22:01.541 --> 22:03.000
Henry realized at once,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.083
he could make a fortune.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.500
He went downstairs to the butler's pantry

22:07.500 --> 22:10.208
and asked for a candle,
a candlestick, and a ruler.

22:10.208 --> 22:12.041
He took them to his bedroom,
locked the door,

22:12.041 --> 22:14.041
drew the curtains,
and turned off the lights.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.625
Put the candle on the dressing-table.
Pulled up a chair.

22:16.625 --> 22:20.083
He noticed with satisfaction
that his eyes were level with the wick.

22:20.083 --> 22:24.000
Using the ruler, he positioned
his face 16 inches from the candle,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.541
as indicated in the book.

22:25.541 --> 22:29.125
Imdad Khan had visualized
the face of the person he loved best,

22:29.125 --> 22:31.666
which, in his case,
was his deceased brother.

22:31.666 --> 22:33.458
Henry didn't have a brother.

22:34.041 --> 22:36.958
He decided instead
to visualize his own face.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.875
As Henry stared into the black area
at the center of the flame,

22:46.875 --> 22:48.583
an extraordinary thing happened.

22:48.583 --> 22:51.791
His mind went absolutely blank,
his brain ceased fidgeting,

22:51.791 --> 22:55.083
and all at once he felt as if
his entire body had become encased,

22:55.083 --> 22:56.000
snug and cozy,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.708
within that little black area
of burning nothingness.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.500
Admittedly, this lasted only 15 seconds.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.791
Then, no matter where,
or what he was doing,

23:03.791 --> 23:07.291
he made a point of practicing
with the candle five times a day.

23:07.291 --> 23:11.583
For the very first time, he threw himself
into something with genuine enthusiasm,

23:11.583 --> 23:14.083
and the progress he made was remarkable.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.166
After six months

23:15.166 --> 23:18.625
he could concentrate absolutely upon
the image of his face for three minutes

23:18.625 --> 23:21.541
without a single outside thought
entering his mind.

23:21.541 --> 23:23.166
"It's me," Henry thought.

23:23.166 --> 23:25.416
"I'm the one-in-a-billion with the ability

23:25.416 --> 23:27.791
to acquire yoga powers
at incredible speed!"

23:27.791 --> 23:31.291
By the end of the first year,
he'd exceeded five and a half minutes.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.375
The time had come.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.833
The living room
of Henry's London flat. Midnight.

23:39.833 --> 23:42.083
He shakes with excitement as,
for the first time,

23:42.083 --> 23:44.291
he places a deck of cards
upside down before him

23:44.291 --> 23:46.041
and concentrates on the top card.

23:46.041 --> 23:49.833
All he sees initially is the ordinary
design of thin red lines on the back,

23:49.833 --> 23:52.750
perhaps the most common
playing-card design in the world.

23:52.750 --> 23:56.375
He now shifts his concentration
to the other side of the card.

23:56.375 --> 24:00.500
He focuses with great intensity
upon the invisible underneath of the card.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.416
Thirty seconds elapse.
One, two, three minutes.

24:03.416 --> 24:04.916
Henry doesn't move a muscle.

24:04.916 --> 24:07.500
His now highly-developed concentration
is absolute.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.500
He visualizes the reverse of the card.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.000
No other thought
is permitted to enter his mind.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.375
During the fourth minute,
something starts to happen.

24:14.375 --> 24:16.333
Slowly, magically, but distinctly,

24:16.333 --> 24:20.125
a black blob becomes a spade,
a twisty squiggle becomes a five.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.708
The five of spades.

24:21.708 --> 24:25.083
Fingers quivering,
he picks up the card and turns it over.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.250
"I've done it," he says.

24:28.333 --> 24:29.541
Henry becomes a fanatic.

24:29.541 --> 24:32.291
He never leaves his flat
except to buy food and drink.

24:32.291 --> 24:34.250
All day and often far into the night,

24:34.250 --> 24:36.583
he crouches over the cards
with the stopwatch.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.833
- Reducing his time, second by second.

24:38.833 --> 24:41.791
In a month, he's at a minute and a half.
Six months, 20 seconds.

24:41.791 --> 24:43.708
Seven more months, ten seconds flat.

24:43.708 --> 24:45.000
His target is five.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.708
Unless he can read through
a card in five seconds,

24:47.708 --> 24:49.875
he won't work the casinos successfully.

24:49.875 --> 24:53.916
Yet the nearer he gets to his target,
the more difficult it becomes to reach it.

24:53.916 --> 24:56.166
Four weeks
to get from ten seconds to nine.

24:56.166 --> 24:58.083
Five more to get from nine to eight.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.791
Hard work no longer bothers him.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.375
He's able to work
12 hours straight, no trouble.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.791
He knows with certainty he'll get there.

25:04.791 --> 25:07.333
The last two seconds
are the hardest, 11 months.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.041
But late one Saturday afternoon...

25:16.708 --> 25:20.583
Five seconds. Henry goes through the pack,
timing himself with every card.

25:20.583 --> 25:24.458
Five seconds. Five seconds. Five seconds.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.833
How long has it taken him
to reach this moment?

25:28.666 --> 25:31.666
Three years and three months
of uninterrupted effort.

25:33.208 --> 25:35.625
There were over
100 legitimate casinos in London.

25:35.625 --> 25:39.750
Henry was a member of no less than ten.
Lord's House was his favorite.

25:39.750 --> 25:43.041
It was the finest in the land,
in a magnificent Georgian mansion.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.166
Good evening, Mr. Sugar.

25:44.166 --> 25:46.916
...said the man
whose job it was to never forget a face.

25:46.916 --> 25:50.125
Henry ascended the marvelous staircase
to the cashier's office.

25:50.125 --> 25:52.250
He wrote a check for £10,000.

25:52.250 --> 25:56.416
Well-fed women circled the roulette wheel
like plump hens around a feeding hopper.

25:56.416 --> 25:58.708
Men with crimson faces,
cigars between their lips

25:58.708 --> 26:01.125
counted their chips,
eyes glittering with greed.

26:02.541 --> 26:04.541
Odd. For the first time in Henry's life,

26:04.541 --> 26:07.583
he looked with distaste upon a room
full of horrible rich people.

26:07.583 --> 26:10.500
He searched for a vacant seat
directly on the dealer's camera left

26:10.500 --> 26:12.166
at any of the blackjack tables.

26:12.166 --> 26:15.250
The dealer took Henry's plaque
and dropped it into a slot.

26:15.250 --> 26:18.458
He was a young-ish man
with black eyes and gray skin.

26:18.458 --> 26:20.791
He never smiled
and only spoke when necessary.

26:20.791 --> 26:23.583
He had slim hands.
There was arithmetic in his fingers.

26:23.583 --> 26:26.875
He picked up a wedge of £25 chips
and placed them in a pile.

26:26.875 --> 26:29.708
He didn't need to count them.
Those nimble fingers were never wrong.

26:29.708 --> 26:31.250
He slid the pile to Henry.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.708
As Henry stacked his chips,

26:32.708 --> 26:34.875
he glanced at the top card
in the dealer's shoe.

26:34.875 --> 26:38.375
In five seconds he read it as a ten.
He pushed out eight chips, £200,

26:38.375 --> 26:40.583
the maximum stake allowed at Lord's House.

26:40.583 --> 26:43.083
He was dealt the ten.
His second card was a nine.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.333
Nineteen all together.

26:44.333 --> 26:45.416
On 19, you stick.

26:45.416 --> 26:49.083
You sit tight and hope the dealer
doesn't get 20 or 21. It's a given.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.708
- When the dealer came to Henry, he said...
- Nineteen.

26:51.708 --> 26:54.333
...and passed to the next player.
"Wait," said Henry.

26:54.333 --> 26:55.958
The dealer came back to Henry.

26:55.958 --> 26:58.333
He raised his eyebrows,
looked with cool eyes.

26:58.333 --> 27:00.583
- You wish to draw to 19?
- ...he asked crisply.

27:00.583 --> 27:04.208
There were only two ranks that
wouldn't bust a 19, the ace and the two.

27:04.208 --> 27:08.250
Only an idiot would risk drawing on 19,
especially with £200 on the table.

27:08.250 --> 27:11.375
The back of the next card lay visible.
The dealer hadn't touched it.

27:11.375 --> 27:14.833
"Yes," Henry said. "Another card."
The dealer shrugged and dealt it.

27:14.833 --> 27:18.083
The two of clubs landed in front of Henry
alongside the ten and the nine.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.708
- 21.
- ...the dealer said evenly.

27:19.708 --> 27:21.750
He glanced up again into Henry's face,

27:21.750 --> 27:24.500
and rested there,
silent, watchful, puzzled.

27:25.583 --> 27:29.208
Henry had unbalanced him. He'd rarely,
if ever, seen anyone draw on 19.

27:29.208 --> 27:31.500
This fellow had
with a calmness and certainty

27:31.500 --> 27:33.750
that was quite staggering, and he'd won.

27:33.750 --> 27:37.166
Henry caught the dealer's look,
realized he'd made a silly mistake.

27:37.166 --> 27:39.500
He'd attracted attention.
"I beg your pardon."

27:39.500 --> 27:41.000
He must never do that again.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.125
He must be very careful,
even make himself lose occasionally.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.250
The game went on.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.041
Henry's advantage was so enormous,

27:47.041 --> 27:49.583
he had difficulty
keeping his winnings reasonable.

27:49.583 --> 27:51.291
In an hour, he'd won £30,000.

27:51.291 --> 27:52.416
There he stopped.

27:52.416 --> 27:54.916
It could just as easily
have been a million.

27:54.916 --> 27:56.208
Thank you.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.958
Henry was now
almost certainly capable of making money

27:58.958 --> 28:01.458
faster than any other person
in the entire world.

28:03.666 --> 28:04.500
Interesting.

28:09.041 --> 28:11.333
Had this been a made-up story
instead of a true one,

28:11.333 --> 28:12.833
it would have been necessary

28:12.833 --> 28:15.583
to invent a surprising
and exciting end for the thing.

28:15.583 --> 28:17.250
Something dramatic and unusual.

28:17.250 --> 28:20.416
For example, Henry could go home
and start counting his money.

28:20.416 --> 28:23.333
While doing this,
he might suddenly begin to feel unwell.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.875
He has a pain in his chest.

28:25.875 --> 28:28.333
He decides to go to bed.
He takes off his clothes.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.250
Walks naked and puts on pajamas.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.458
He passes the full-length mirror
against the wall. He stops.

28:33.458 --> 28:36.541
Automatically, from force of habit,
he starts to concentrate.

28:36.541 --> 28:38.833
All at once, he sees through his own skin.

28:38.833 --> 28:41.250
Like an X-ray, only better.
He sees everything.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.666
Arteries, veins,
the blood pumping through him.

28:43.666 --> 28:46.541
Liver, kidneys, intestines.
He sees his heart beating.

28:46.541 --> 28:48.708
He looks at where the pain is coming from

28:48.708 --> 28:52.958
and sees a dark lump inside the large vein
leading into the heart on the right side.

28:52.958 --> 28:55.916
A blood clot. At first,
the clot appears to be stationary.

28:55.916 --> 28:59.083
Then it moves. The movement's slight.
Only a millimeter or so.

28:59.083 --> 29:01.708
The blood is pumping up behind the clot
and pushing past it,

29:01.708 --> 29:03.083
and the clot moves again.

29:03.083 --> 29:06.166
It jerks forward about half an inch.
Henry watches in terror.

29:06.166 --> 29:09.666
He knows a large clot that's broken free
and is traveling in the vein

29:09.666 --> 29:11.125
will reach the heart.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.500
He is about to die.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.375
Not a bad ending for fiction,
but this isn't fiction.

29:15.375 --> 29:16.416
This story is fact.

29:16.416 --> 29:19.333
The only untrue thing is Henry's name,
which wasn't Henry Sugar.

29:19.333 --> 29:22.750
His name has to be protected.
It still must be protected.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.875
Apart from that, this is a true story,

29:24.875 --> 29:28.000
and because it's a true story,
it must have the true ending.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.583
Here's what actually happened.

29:33.916 --> 29:36.875
Henry walked for an hour.
The evening was cool and pleasant.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.583
The city still wide awake.

29:38.583 --> 29:42.041
He could feel the thick bankroll
in the inside pocket of his jacket.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.500
He patted it gently.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.708
A lot of money for an hour's work.

29:45.708 --> 29:47.791
Yet, he was a puzzled man.

29:47.791 --> 29:51.583
He couldn't understand why he felt
so little excitement about this success.

29:51.583 --> 29:54.333
If this had happened three years ago,
before the yoga,

29:54.333 --> 29:56.041
he'd have gone crazy with excitement,

29:56.041 --> 29:58.666
he'd be rushing off
to a nightclub to celebrate.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.750
But Henry didn't feel excited.

30:00.750 --> 30:02.083
He felt sad.

30:02.083 --> 30:04.916
Every time he made a bet,
he'd been certain to win.

30:04.916 --> 30:08.083
There was no thrill,
no suspense, no danger.

30:08.083 --> 30:11.083
He knew he could travel
around the world making millions.

30:11.083 --> 30:12.750
But was it going to be any fun?

30:12.750 --> 30:15.000
Another thing.
Was it not entirely possible

30:15.000 --> 30:17.166
the process of acquiring yoga powers

30:17.166 --> 30:20.833
had completely and utterly
changed his entire outlook on life?

30:20.833 --> 30:22.041
It was possible.

30:22.750 --> 30:25.458
The next morning,
Henry woke up late, got out of bed,

30:25.458 --> 30:28.166
saw the enormous bundle
lying on his dressing-table,

30:28.166 --> 30:30.208
and didn't want it.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.333
Oi?!

30:55.333 --> 30:58.875
Good morning, sir.
That's for you! It's a present.

30:58.875 --> 30:59.791
I...

31:01.000 --> 31:01.833
A what?

31:02.625 --> 31:03.958
Put it in your pocket!

31:05.458 --> 31:06.291
All right.

31:15.208 --> 31:16.250
What is it?

31:16.250 --> 31:18.041
-  It's money.
- Keep it!

31:24.583 --> 31:25.416
Hey!

31:28.875 --> 31:29.833
Come on...

32:04.458 --> 32:06.291
The doorbell rang.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.875
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry about the crowd.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.208
I was giving away some money.

32:10.208 --> 32:12.750
- You're inciting a riot!
- Just giving away some money.

32:12.750 --> 32:15.000
I won't do it again. They'll soon go away.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
The policeman took one hand off his hip,
produced a £50 note.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.333
- A-ha, you got one yourself.
- This is evidence. Where's the money from?

32:21.333 --> 32:24.166
I won it at blackjack.
I had a tremendously lucky night.

32:24.166 --> 32:26.875
Henry named the club
and the policeman wrote it down.

32:26.875 --> 32:28.333
They'll tell you it's true.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.250
The policeman lowered the book.
I don't care.

32:30.250 --> 32:31.958
- Don't you?
- Not whatsoever.

32:31.958 --> 32:33.583
In fact, I believe your story,

32:33.583 --> 32:36.541
but that doesn't excuse
what you did even the tiniest bit.

32:36.541 --> 32:38.958
I didn't do anything illegal, did I?

32:39.791 --> 32:40.708
Illegal?

32:41.458 --> 32:42.583
You're an idiot!

32:43.333 --> 32:46.708
If you're lucky enough to win yourself
a big sum of money like that,

32:46.708 --> 32:49.750
and want to give it away,
you don't throw it out of the window.

32:49.750 --> 32:53.958
You give it somewhere it'll do some good.
A hospital for instance, or an orphanage.

32:53.958 --> 32:56.125
There's hospitals and orphanages all over

32:56.125 --> 32:59.375
got hardly enough money
to buy the kids a present for Christmas.

32:59.375 --> 33:01.208
Then comes a spoiled idiot

33:01.208 --> 33:03.666
who's never known
what it's like to be hard up,

33:03.666 --> 33:06.666
and you throw the stuff
out into the street!

33:06.666 --> 33:09.666
The policeman stomped down the stairs
and out of the door.

33:09.666 --> 33:10.666
Henry didn't move.

33:10.666 --> 33:13.416
Those words, and the fury
with which they were spoken,

33:13.416 --> 33:14.750
struck hard and deep.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.375
He was ashamed.

33:16.375 --> 33:17.708
It was an awful feeling.

33:23.916 --> 33:25.000
Then, all at once,

33:25.000 --> 33:28.500
Henry felt a powerful electricity
tingling through his entire body,

33:28.500 --> 33:32.208
and there began to come to him
an idea that was to change everything.

33:32.208 --> 33:33.791
He started pacing up and down,

33:33.791 --> 33:36.916
ticking off the points
that would make his idea possible.

33:36.916 --> 33:39.333
One. I'm going to win
a very large sum of money

33:39.333 --> 33:42.416
each and every day of my life
from this moment forward.

33:42.416 --> 33:46.250
Two. I can go to the
same casino only once every six months.

33:46.250 --> 33:49.000
Three. I must never win
too much money in one sitting.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.666
£50,000 pounds a night,
that's my limit.

33:51.666 --> 33:55.166
Four.
£50,000 a night for 365 days a year.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.916
That's £18.25 million.

33:57.916 --> 33:59.166
Five. Keep moving.

33:59.166 --> 34:01.791
No more than three nights
at a stretch in any city.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.958
London, Monte-Carlo, Cannes, Biarritz,

34:03.958 --> 34:07.083
Deauville, Las Vegas,
Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Nassau.

34:07.083 --> 34:11.416
Six. I'll take the money and establish
hospitals and orphanages around the world.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.791
Corny and sentimental
as a dream,

34:13.791 --> 34:16.083
but as a reality,
I think I can make it work.

34:16.083 --> 34:20.208
I don't think it'd be corny at all.
It would be wonderfully stupendous.

34:20.208 --> 34:23.875
Seven. I need a partner who can
sit behind a desk and receive the money,

34:23.875 --> 34:25.541
then send it where it's needed.

34:25.541 --> 34:28.791
Someone I can deeply,
emphatically, categorically trust forever.

34:28.791 --> 34:32.041
John Winston was Henry's accountant,
and had been his father's too,

34:32.041 --> 34:34.708
and John's father had been
Henry's father's father's accountant.

34:34.708 --> 34:36.708
You could be the richest man on Earth.

34:38.833 --> 34:41.000
I don't want to be
the richest man on Earth.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.250
I can't operate in England.
The taxman'll take it all.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.416
I'll have to move to Switzerland.
But not tomorrow.

34:48.416 --> 34:51.125
I'm not unattached like you
with no responsibilities.

34:51.125 --> 34:54.000
I must talk to my family,
give notice to my partners.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.541
I must sell my house,
find another in Switzerland,

34:56.541 --> 34:58.916
take the kids out of school.
These things take time.

34:58.916 --> 35:02.125
One year later,
Henry had sent just over £120 million

35:02.125 --> 35:03.875
to John Winston in Lausanne.

35:03.875 --> 35:05.958
The money was delivered five days a week

35:05.958 --> 35:08.250
to a Swiss company
called Winston Sugar, LLC.

35:08.250 --> 35:11.250
Nobody except John and Henry
knew where the money came from

35:11.250 --> 35:12.708
or what would happen to it.

35:12.708 --> 35:14.458
The Monday remittance was the biggest

35:14.458 --> 35:17.125
because it included the take
for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,

35:17.125 --> 35:18.333
when the banks were closed.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.041
He moved with astonishing speed,

35:20.041 --> 35:22.750
changing his identity
several times in a single week.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.416
Often, the only clue John had
of Henry's whereabouts

35:25.416 --> 35:29.250
was the address of the bank which had
sent the money. It was stupendous.

35:49.541 --> 35:52.958
Henry died last year,
age 63, from a pulmonary embolism.

35:52.958 --> 35:56.166
He saw it coming, quite literally,
but was very much at peace.

35:56.166 --> 35:58.833
He'd been following his plan
for just over 20 years.

35:58.833 --> 36:01.458
He'd made £644 million.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.041
He'd left 21 well-established,

36:03.041 --> 36:06.208
well-run children's hospitals
and orphanages around the world,

36:06.208 --> 36:10.333
administered and financed from Lausanne
by John Winston and his staff.

36:10.333 --> 36:11.666
His work was complete.

36:16.125 --> 36:20.208
Now, how do I know all this?
Good question. I'll tell you.

36:20.208 --> 36:23.791
Soon after Henry's death, John Winston
telephoned me from Switzerland.

36:23.791 --> 36:25.291
He introduced himself simply

36:25.291 --> 36:28.750
as the head of a company
calling itself Winston Sugar, LLC,

36:28.750 --> 36:31.000
and asked
if I'd come to Lausanne to see him

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
with a view to writing
a brief history of the organization.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.250
I don't know how he chose me.

36:36.250 --> 36:39.125
Probably had a list of writers
and stuck a pin in it.

36:39.125 --> 36:41.375
He would pay me well, he said, and added,

36:41.375 --> 36:43.583
"A remarkable man has died recently."

36:43.583 --> 36:45.291
"His name was Henry Sugar."

36:45.291 --> 36:49.125
"I think people ought to know a bit
about what he has done for the world."

36:49.125 --> 36:50.208
In my ignorance,

36:50.208 --> 36:53.000
I asked whether the story
was really interesting enough

36:53.000 --> 36:54.541
to merit being put on paper.

36:54.541 --> 36:58.041
This annoyed John Winston very much.
Perhaps it even offended him.

36:58.625 --> 37:00.083
In five minutes on the phone,

37:00.083 --> 37:03.041
he told me
about Henry Sugar's secret career.

37:03.041 --> 37:04.541
It was secret no longer.

37:04.541 --> 37:08.083
Henry was dead and would never
enter another casino again.

37:08.083 --> 37:10.083
"I'm coming," I said.

37:10.083 --> 37:13.000
In Lausanne,
I met John Winston, now over 70,

37:13.000 --> 37:14.291
also Max Engelman,

37:14.291 --> 37:17.291
a renowned make-up artist
who traveled the world with Henry

37:17.291 --> 37:20.166
creating fantastic disguises
to conceal his identity.

37:20.166 --> 37:24.333
They were both shattered by Henry's death.
Max even more so than John Winston.

37:24.333 --> 37:26.625
I loved him. He was a great man.

37:26.625 --> 37:29.666
John Winston showed me
the original dark-blue exercise book

37:29.666 --> 37:32.666
written by Z.Z. Chatterjee
in Calcutta in 1935.

37:32.666 --> 37:34.833
I later copied it out word-for-word.

37:34.833 --> 37:36.375
"One last question," I said.

37:36.375 --> 37:40.083
"You keep calling him Henry Sugar,
yet you tell me that wasn't his name."

37:40.083 --> 37:43.375
"Don't you want me to say
who he really was when I do the story?"

37:43.375 --> 37:44.750
- No.
- ...John Winston said.

37:44.750 --> 37:47.208
Max and I promised
never to reveal his identity.

37:47.208 --> 37:49.750
Oh, I suppose
it'll probably leak out sooner or later.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.833
He was from a well-known English family,

37:51.833 --> 37:54.500
but I'd appreciate it
if you didn't try to find out.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.791
Just please,
call him plain Mr. Henry Sugar.

37:58.833 --> 38:00.291
And that is what I have done.
