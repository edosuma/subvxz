00:31.740 --> 00:33.199
Here comes the mail.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.993
I wonder if I got anything.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.579
I'm not gonna get anything.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.749
I sure hope my new driver's license
finally shows up.

00:40.832 --> 00:44.085
I hear the new security holograms
are outstanding.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.171
Maybe that's what's holding things up.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.965
I'll tell you why your license
is taking so long.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.967
The US Postal Service is bogged down

00:51.051 --> 00:54.345
in the most elaborate
psy-ops campaign in history.

00:54.512 --> 00:58.224
First, they fatten us up
with all those two-for-one pizza coupons.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.685
Then when we're too logy
to put up a fight,

01:00.769 --> 01:02.979
they sell us off to the Red Cross,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.316
who removes our kidneys
which go back on the pizzas

01:06.399 --> 01:09.235
to start the process all over again.

01:09.319 --> 01:12.155
Did you mean for all those words
to come out together

01:12.238 --> 01:14.032
or did they just fall out randomly?

01:15.575 --> 01:19.037
Hank, you're just a mouse
caught in the government's Habitrail.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.332
Ring the bell and get your cheese, man.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.541
Howdy, Hank.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.169
You got something
from the Department of Public Safety.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.005
My driver's license.
We were just talking about that.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.006
Mm-hmm.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.425
And I didn't forget you, Mr. Gribble.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.636
How did you know my name?

01:34.928 --> 01:36.054
Go to hell.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.101
Hey, it's here. Guess what.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.852
-Driver's license.
-Driver's license.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.646
"Hank R. Hill.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.981
Eyes: Brown." Yes, sir.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.776
"Weight 220." And dang proud of it.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.529
F?"

01:52.612 --> 01:54.114
That's female.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.497
Could you imagine Dad a woman?

02:02.580 --> 02:05.625
Now where did I put
my panty hose?

02:05.708 --> 02:07.335
Bobby, living room.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.837
Look at that, Peggy.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.172
Right over the Texas State Seal.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.091
It's not that big of a deal, honey.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.175
Just ignore it.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.553
Nobody even checks IDs anymore.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.180
But what if I died in some car accident,

02:19.264 --> 02:22.058
and because of my license,
they put me in the ladies' morgue?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.435
You can bet that'd wind up on the news.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.895
Are you gonna wear that, Hank?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.356
Because I have a little purse
that would look so good...

02:28.439 --> 02:30.275
Peggy, living room.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.951
Huh?

02:41.244 --> 02:42.453
He-ya.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.205
I just had the worst dream.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.123
Oh.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.125
How about I read you a story?

02:47.208 --> 02:49.544
Just like I used to
before you got a mustache

02:49.627 --> 02:50.962
and became so frightening.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.297
Here we go,

02:52.380 --> 02:54.799
the greatest fairy tale ever told...

02:54.883 --> 02:56.301
It's got everything.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.011
The Prince of Camelot,

02:58.094 --> 03:00.263
Rubys and magic bullets.

03:02.473 --> 03:06.811
"The gloomy overcast sky had given way
to bright sunshine

03:06.895 --> 03:10.023
as Air Force One touched down
in Dallas..."

03:10.106 --> 03:14.319
"Lee Harvey Oswald purchased a Coca-Cola
from a vending machine

03:14.402 --> 03:17.113
and was preparing to eat
a chicken lunch..."

03:17.197 --> 03:19.449
"The President's motorcade proceeded

03:19.532 --> 03:22.577
through downtown Dallas
towards Dealey Plaza."

03:22.869 --> 03:25.288
Why is it called Dealey Plaza anyway?

03:25.496 --> 03:28.208
Hmm, excellent question, Joseph.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.668
Uh... Doesn't really say here...

03:30.877 --> 03:32.629
We could "see appendix,"

03:32.712 --> 03:34.797
but that's what's been keeping
the kitchen table

03:34.881 --> 03:36.591
from wobbling all these years.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.385
But, Dad, now I'll never be able to sleep.

03:40.511 --> 03:44.098
How can I say no
to those beady little brown eyes.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.395
Wow, look at it all.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.481
Charts and footnotes and maps.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.817
Ooh, here's a cool diagram
of Dealey Plaza.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.946
So, the motorcade was going west on...

03:59.405 --> 04:01.741
Wait, I thought they were headed east,

04:01.824 --> 04:04.285
but, hah, this is east.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.870
Wait, I'm all messed up here.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.330
Where's the grassy knoll?

04:09.624 --> 04:10.750
This isn't right.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.211
I always thought west was this way...

04:13.294 --> 04:15.338
The motorcade turned and went...

04:15.421 --> 04:16.881
How could... I thought... But...

04:16.965 --> 04:18.383
West?

04:26.057 --> 04:26.891
Okay.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.352
So... heading west...

04:29.435 --> 04:31.646
the grassy knoll is in front of Kennedy.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.315
The Book Depository is behind him...

04:34.899 --> 04:37.360
But... but that makes sense.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.945
It can't make sense.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.323
It's the Warren Commission report
for God's sake.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.411
But that means the government
could be right.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.589
So, where's that new license, Mrs. Hill?

04:58.673 --> 05:01.009
Or should I say Miss Hill?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.593
Can't go wrong with miss.

05:04.012 --> 05:08.308
I don't know why everybody thinks
me being mistaken for a lady is funny.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.434
It's not.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.941
Is that funny?

05:17.025 --> 05:21.279
Nope. Nancy says that Dale's really upset
about this Kennedy thing.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.156
We should probably talk to him.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.783
At least get him to put on some pants.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.784
Dale?

05:27.493 --> 05:28.703
Hey, guys.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.330
How ya doing, buddy?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.457
I finally stopped crying...

05:32.540 --> 05:34.792
only because I started vomiting.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.503
I know that assassination
meant a lot to you, Dale.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.546
I'm sorry, uh...

05:38.629 --> 05:41.299
My world view... pffft, it's gone.

05:41.382 --> 05:45.636
I mean, if they were right about Kennedy,
maybe we really did go to the moon.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.348
Oh, man, how could you not know
dang ol' direction, man?

05:48.431 --> 05:50.808
Everybody knows it's west, man.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.226
I didn't have a compass

05:52.310 --> 05:55.229
when I was reading
the freaking book, Boomhauer.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.357
Which direction are you facing right now?

05:57.690 --> 06:00.777
Huh? Not so easy, is it, Magellan?

06:00.860 --> 06:04.113
You've got other conspiracies, Dale.
You got, uh...

06:04.322 --> 06:05.865
Uh... Aliens.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.575
That's right, you got aliens.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.328
Why don't you tell us about
how the aliens are...

06:10.828 --> 06:12.413
are gonna do things?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.832
Don't you patronize me.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.376
I got to go to Dallas.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.211
I need to figure this thing out.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.465
Maybe if you showed Dale
your lady license,

06:22.548 --> 06:23.716
it would cheer him up.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.849
Uh, I just got my driver's license
in the mail,

06:31.933 --> 06:33.601
and it says I'm a female.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.685
And how can I help you?

06:34.769 --> 06:37.188
Uh, well, I'm clearly not one.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.774
Then why did you mark "F"
on your application?

06:39.857 --> 06:40.900
I didn't.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.611
Now if you could just change it for me?
Please.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.322
We just don't "change"
driver's licenses anymore.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.074
I'll admit, in the old days,

06:48.157 --> 06:50.451
we used to take pictures
of donkeys or anything for a laugh,

06:50.535 --> 06:52.161
but all that changed once the DPS

06:52.245 --> 06:54.789
became a division of the Office
of Homeland Security.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.750
Look, someone pressed
the wrong button on their computer.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.420
Can't you just fix it?
I brought my birth certificate.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.921
I'm not the post office.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.965
You need to send this
to the Austin branch,

07:04.048 --> 07:05.425
registered mail, and bingo,

07:05.508 --> 07:07.176
they'll square it away
in four to six weeks.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.387
-Now if you'll step aside, ma'am.
-Ma'am?

07:09.470 --> 07:11.639
I can't get sued
if I call you what's on the license.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.228
Eh...

07:17.311 --> 07:19.439
Okay, stay calm.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.650
I'm in Dealey Plaza. It's 1963.

07:22.733 --> 07:26.237
I am President Kennedy
and I'm not going this way.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.406
I'm going this way.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.659
Texas School Book Depository.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.578
Sixth floor.

07:36.289 --> 07:41.127
It just makes absolute
total complete perfect sense.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.675
The grassy knoll.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.013
Kennedy was not killed by a lone gunman.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.515
Tell me, brother. Let me believe.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.017
Kennedy wasn't killed at all.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.977
He dropped out of a false bottom
in the limo

07:58.060 --> 08:00.813
and is now an easy-listening DJ
in Northern Michigan.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.232
Kennedy didn't get shot in '63.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.692
He slipped down to Mexico

08:04.775 --> 08:08.696
where he got in on the ground floor
of the Pollo Loco franchise.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.704
I don't know, I don't know...

08:17.038 --> 08:19.790
I mean, I thought I knew,
but it turns out I didn't...

08:19.874 --> 08:21.459
Excuse me, sir. You okay?

08:22.376 --> 08:25.171
Okay, let's get you a hot meal
and get you taken care of.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.969
But... You'd do that for me?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.429
Just doing my job, sir.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.153
The DPS said they couldn't do it
because of national security.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.989
What does the contents of my underpants

08:52.073 --> 08:54.200
have to do with national security?

08:59.413 --> 09:00.248
Dale?

09:00.915 --> 09:03.459
Greetings, my fellow Americans.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.255
Uh, you know you got the flags flying
right side up, there, Dale.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.339
Yep.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.717
Hey, did you guys know
that there's a star for each state?

09:11.968 --> 09:12.885
Brilliant.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.054
<i>♪ You're a grand old flag ♪</i>

09:15.137 --> 09:17.014
<i>♪ You're a something, something flag ♪</i>

09:17.098 --> 09:20.351
<i>♪ And forever in peace may you wave ♪</i>

09:20.434 --> 09:25.022
<i>♪ You're the emblem blah
The one blah, blah ♪</i>

09:28.859 --> 09:31.237
So... now you love the government?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.573
Give me liberty or give me death.

09:33.656 --> 09:38.828
But only the kind of liberty you find
in a controlled, well-regulated society.

09:38.911 --> 09:42.123
Uh, we are talking about
the US government, right?

09:42.206 --> 09:45.334
Not another one you made up
with your buddies from the gun club?

09:45.418 --> 09:48.254
I figure if the government
was right about Kennedy,

09:48.337 --> 09:50.881
they must be right about everything.
Look at this.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.343
"Government warning:
Cigarettes cause cancer."

09:54.510 --> 09:58.055
Only a true friend tells you the stuff
you don't want to hear.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.515
I could've told you that, Dale.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.184
-But you didn't, did you?
-Shame on you, Hank.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.395
The government
has always been there for me,

10:04.478 --> 10:07.356
and now it's time for me
to be there for it.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.484
Hey, who wants to go down
to the US post office

10:10.568 --> 10:12.653
and tell 'em what a good job
they're doing?

10:12.737 --> 10:14.280
Why don't we go down there

10:14.363 --> 10:16.449
and find out what happened
to my birth certificate?

10:16.532 --> 10:18.200
I sent it registered mail,

10:18.284 --> 10:20.911
and the Department of Public Safety
still hasn't gotten it,

10:20.995 --> 10:22.872
and the post office
doesn't know where it is.

10:22.955 --> 10:27.793
You should be happy you live in a country
that even has a post office.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.920
Show some gratitude.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.508

10:34.592 --> 10:38.137

10:47.396 --> 10:49.732
Hey, Dad, I was just thinking,

10:49.815 --> 10:51.692
if you really were a woman,

10:51.776 --> 10:54.945
that would make you and mom lesbians.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.739
That's it. The cable's gone.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.115
He's right, Hank.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.575
We wouldn't even be married.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.494
We'd be domestic partners.

11:01.577 --> 11:05.748
We overcame years of scrutiny
in a small but meaningful ceremony.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.710
Huh.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.173
What? You want "documentation"
of my gender?

11:14.256 --> 11:15.174
I don't get it.

11:15.257 --> 11:19.011
Isn't the Adam's apple I've been yelling
at you with proof enough?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.389
No, I'll need your doctor
to sign this form

11:21.472 --> 11:23.432
confirming you are the gender
you claim to be.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.477
This DPS is really amazing.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.229
I didn't know it was possible

11:28.312 --> 11:31.023
to feel ignored and violated
at the same time.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.944
Now, get on your got-dang computer
and change my license.

11:35.027 --> 11:38.155
Are you making a threat
to a public safety employee?

11:38.572 --> 11:39.448
What?

11:40.241 --> 11:42.326
No, I, I'm not making a threat.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.744
Okay, then.

11:47.331 --> 11:52.211
Sha-sha-sha. Sha-sha.
I'm so jacked up on America.

11:52.294 --> 11:55.798
Any of you boys mind
if I recite the Constitution?

11:56.173 --> 11:57.758
-Sure.
-Sure, man, go ahead on, man.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.470
-"We the people, in order to form..."
-Come on, Dale.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.763
I've had a long day.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.181
Courtesy of the US of A.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.976
I love this country
as much as the next guy...

12:07.059 --> 12:08.769
Not if the next guy's me.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.730
Look, if the government is so perfect,

12:10.813 --> 12:13.691
why did they send me a license
that says I'm a woman, huh?

12:16.485 --> 12:19.321
Because you're a woman.
It makes so much sense.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.032
-What?
-Do you really think Hank's a woman?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.994
Not just your ideal
of what a perfect woman would be?

12:25.077 --> 12:27.621
Dale, if you actually believe
that I'm a woman,

12:27.705 --> 12:29.915
then you're crazier now
than you've ever been.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.877
Crazy? You tell me what's crazier.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.547
That the government's free cheese
contained surveillance devices

12:36.630 --> 12:38.674
to monitor America's underclass--

12:38.758 --> 12:41.218
as I once believed,
or that you're a woman

12:41.302 --> 12:42.928
as I now believe.

12:43.012 --> 12:48.267
If my country says you're a woman,
I say, <i>"Enchante,</i><i>madame."</i>

12:48.350 --> 12:52.938
Mm. Whoa, I think you've had
enough to drink, sweetheart.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.776
Thanks for seeing me, Doctor.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.236
My regular physician
couldn't squeeze me in.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.405
I got this form from the DPS.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.365
I just need you to say that I'm a man.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.994
Whoa, I'm not signing a paper
that "just says" anything.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.621
Those days went out with house calls.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.873
But I'm clearly a man.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.210
Look, I am willing to do a blood test
and a genetic screening.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.837
That is proof positive and not actionable.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.757
Can't you just do a, you know...

13:20.341 --> 13:21.592
visual exam?

13:21.675 --> 13:24.553
Gender is not as cut and dried
as it used to be, Mr. Hill.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.891
Even if you have male organs,
there's transsexual hormone therapy,

13:28.974 --> 13:30.100
plastic surgery...

13:30.184 --> 13:33.395
Can't you tell the difference
between the ones made by God

13:33.479 --> 13:36.607
and ones jerry-rigged out of a toe
and some old skin?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.442
Legally, no.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.865
These back issues of <i>Rosie</i>
are just fabulous.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.034
They said it would take two to three weeks

13:47.117 --> 13:50.746
to get back my results...
you know, to prove I'm a man.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.915
Oh, why are you fighting this so much,
Hank?

13:52.998 --> 13:57.086
You know, my hair stylist was telling me
that I am a lipstick lesbian.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.089
Apparently, that's the best kind.
You are quite lucky.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.967
Bobby, get off the roof.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.052
If you're up there with that cape again,

14:05.135 --> 14:07.137
so help me...

14:07.221 --> 14:10.516
Look. I thought with Old Glory
over your head,

14:10.599 --> 14:13.352
you might feel a little more pride
in being an American.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.564
My shingles. Get down here right now.

14:16.647 --> 14:20.192
Yeah, I bet it looks pretty
damn majestic from down there.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.361
Now, I could only fit 34 stars,

14:22.444 --> 14:25.614
so pretend it's 1861, if you would.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.074
I'm not messing around.

14:27.157 --> 14:30.286
I have proven I can kick your ass
while standing on a ladder.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.590
Hank, I, I didn't see you as a flag hater.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.260
I'm not.
You painted my entire got-dang roof.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.721
With the symbol of our amazing government.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.891
Yeah, well, I don't want to talk
about the government right now.

14:51.974 --> 14:56.186
I am so got-dang tired
of all the bureaucracy and red tape.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.981
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I hear what you're saying.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.859
Uh, I got some paint remover at the house.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.027
I'll just...

15:06.113 --> 15:08.032
Office of Homeland Security?

15:08.115 --> 15:10.367
Wow. Is this Tom Ridge?

15:10.868 --> 15:13.162
Oh. Hello, Jeff.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.915
I would like to report an anti-American.

15:15.998 --> 15:19.835
My neighbor is making inflammatory remarks
about the government,

15:19.919 --> 15:23.464
and he is defacing
an American flag as we speak.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.550
He is also in the process
of altering his identity.

15:26.634 --> 15:30.721
Hank Hill, 123 Rainey Street.

15:34.975 --> 15:39.563
Let's say an Apache helicopter
were to land over here.

15:39.647 --> 15:44.026
Would there be room for its gun turrets
to be pointed at, say, Hank's house?

15:44.109 --> 15:46.904
You cannot speak
until my roof is spotless.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.449
Whoa. A black Suburban.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.328
The new models are much smaller
and greener than last year's.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.623
Morning, gentlemen,
looking for a Hank Hill.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.166
Resisting arrest.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.794
Why don't we, uh, head inside?

16:03.754 --> 16:05.839
You think I'm a threat to America?

16:05.923 --> 16:07.466
That was the call we received, sir.

16:07.549 --> 16:10.344
Look, I've had some trouble
with my driver's license,

16:10.427 --> 16:11.804
but I love this country.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.391
It's illegal for us to "profile" anyone,
but I know what I'm looking for.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.977
Not that I'm looking for
anything in particular,

16:18.060 --> 16:19.061
but you're not it.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.731
Yeah, but who made you think I was?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.650
I can't say. Maybe nobody.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.736
Maybe somebody. Like I said, I can't say.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.405
Probably not him.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.664
No more, Dale.

16:38.747 --> 16:42.251
I've put up with some giblet-headed things
out of you in the past,

16:42.334 --> 16:44.795
but calling the FBI on me, that's final.

16:44.878 --> 16:49.258
Why don't you both have a nice cold beer?
Beer always calms everybody down.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.719
I'm sorry, but after the stunt
you just pulled,

16:51.802 --> 16:53.137
we are no longer friends.

16:53.220 --> 16:57.391
Fine. Nancy doesn't approve of me
having lady friends anyway.

17:01.562 --> 17:05.441
So he wormed his way out
of the usually firm grasp

17:05.524 --> 17:07.234
of the FBI, did he?

17:08.902 --> 17:12.614
Well, looks like I'll have
to bring in ol' Hank myself.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.577
Soon the Bald Eagle
will be on him like white on rice.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.495
Or brown. Or yellow.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.206
Because our country is a melting pot.

17:21.331 --> 17:26.587
Yep, I just have to bide my time
and wait for the right moment.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.922
Mail call.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.675
I have something here for Mrs. Hill.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.303
Huh, I wonder which one of you
this is for.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.971
I'm getting tired of that joke.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.849
Seriously. It's addressed to Mrs. Hill,

17:38.932 --> 17:42.603
but it's from the Texas
Propane Gas Association.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.188
The TPGA?

17:44.271 --> 17:48.776
Oh, God, I've been nominated
for Texas Propane Woman of the year.

17:48.859 --> 17:51.528
That tears it. They've pushed me too far.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.322
I'm going down to that DPS,

17:53.405 --> 17:56.283
and I'm getting my license fixed
once and for all.

17:56.366 --> 18:00.204
<i>I don't care if I have to climb over
that counter and do it myself.</i>

18:00.287 --> 18:03.165
This is what I've been biding for.
An outburst.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.042
In a government institution.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.629
Octavio, plan F, Arlen DPS.

18:08.712 --> 18:09.963
What are you doing, sug?

18:10.047 --> 18:13.926
I'm sending the police to respond
to a "disturbance" at the DPS.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.929
And everyone will see Hank Hill
for what he truly is.

18:17.012 --> 18:20.724
An America hating he/she.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.936
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, sug.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.854
Letting Hank get himself
into trouble like that.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.065
First lesson they taught us
at the Academy.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.317
Do not get emotionally involved.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.568
What academy?

18:32.736 --> 18:37.366
Anyway, even if I wanted to stop Hank,
which I don't, it's too late.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.118
The wheels are in spin.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.661
You could go down there and help him.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.705
Why should I do that?
He's a threat to the government.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.916
The one that makes sure my air is clean

18:45.999 --> 18:49.795
and that my food has only
an acceptable amount of rat feces in it.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.463
He's your best friend.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.715
Don't you see?

18:53.799 --> 18:56.677
I've been undermining
the US government for 40 years.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.804
This will help repay my debt.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.515
All I know, sug,
is that back when you were crazy

19:01.598 --> 19:04.935
and thought the government was evil,
who looked out for you?

19:08.897 --> 19:09.898
Next.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.026
All right, here it is.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.113
I have tried to be patient with you,
but I've had enough.

19:16.196 --> 19:19.408
My name is Hank Hill, and I am a man.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.786
You are gonna change my license
to reflect that or else.

19:22.870 --> 19:23.871
Is that a threat?

19:23.954 --> 19:25.873
If it has to be.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.335
-Excuse me.
-What now, Dale?

19:30.419 --> 19:33.297
I am Dale Gribble, American citizen,

19:33.380 --> 19:36.049
and I demand that
you help my disturbed friend here.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.635
-I'm sorry, sir, but the state requires...
-Listen,

19:39.011 --> 19:41.305
I've never been able
to say this in my whole life,

19:41.388 --> 19:44.516
but as of 2 p.m. yesterday,
I am a taxpayer.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.269
And I demand $36 worth of service.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.272
-Sir, if you...
-I know the chain of command

19:50.355 --> 19:53.150
starting with your supervisor,
Franklin Thomas,

19:53.275 --> 19:57.446
all the way up to the Under-intendent
of Transportation, Edward Dibble,

19:57.529 --> 19:59.239
whose daughters, Pat and Ellie,

19:59.323 --> 20:04.119
played Ladybug Soccer with the daughters
of the President of the United States.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.955
And I'm not afraid
to make some phone calls.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.959
I'm your worst nightmare.

20:11.043 --> 20:15.214
I have a three-line phone
and nothing at all to do with my time.

20:21.011 --> 20:21.845
Uh,

20:21.929 --> 20:23.972
here's your interim driver's license,
Mr. Hill.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.808
Please confirm the information is correct
and sign on the line.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.984
You really helped me out back there, Dale.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.445
-I appreciate it.
-No problem, friend.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.948
But I have to ask you a tough question.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.116
Hank Hill,

20:43.825 --> 20:45.077
are you a man?

20:45.160 --> 20:47.579
Yes, Dale, I'm a man.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.832
Okay. I'm willing to take that on faith.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.002
Here's what still puzzles me, though.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.964
If you are a man,
then the government is wrong.

20:57.047 --> 20:57.881
Uh-huh.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.176
But if the government is right,
and you really are a woman,

21:01.551 --> 21:03.679
they shouldn't have caved so easily.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.514
That shows lack of conviction.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.516
Yeah, that's a tough one all right.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.600
Huh.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.436
I got some thinking to do.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.729
-<i>Where did I put my panty hose?</i>
