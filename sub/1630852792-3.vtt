WEBVTT

01:10.600 --> 01:11.920
Where's he gone?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.240
Slippery little zogger.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.680
He's in there, ain't he?

01:17.800 --> 01:19.040
I've nearly got him.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.160
Grab 'im, Ruff, grab 'im!

01:21.240 --> 01:22.320
[grunts]

01:22.400 --> 01:24.440
I've... Hang on...

01:24.520 --> 01:26.360
Gotcha!

01:26.440 --> 01:28.680
Ow! Little zogger bit me!

01:28.760 --> 01:30.560

01:32.920 --> 01:35.240

01:35.640 --> 01:36.720
[screaming]

01:36.800 --> 01:38.880
[laughing]

01:38.960 --> 01:40.000
[slurps]

01:40.960 --> 01:41.960
[approaching]

01:46.840 --> 01:48.760
[mechanical whirring]

01:51.720 --> 01:55.160
What the zog is you two doing
to me best grot!?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.800
Boss! They was gonna eat me!

01:57.880 --> 01:59.200
That so?

01:59.680 --> 02:02.080
We was just...

02:02.720 --> 02:03.920
[grunts]

02:05.920 --> 02:07.800
[blade slashing]

02:07.880 --> 02:08.880
[slams]

02:08.960 --> 02:10.040
[yells]

02:10.960 --> 02:13.200
Don't even think about it!

02:13.840 --> 02:15.640
[whining]

02:16.320 --> 02:17.920
Pathetic.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.600
Really pathetic.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.040
[unclenches]

02:22.240 --> 02:24.960
Zog me, this won't do.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.720
This won't do!

02:27.240 --> 02:28.400
What are you doing?

02:28.880 --> 02:33.120
You yoofs ain't ever gonna be proper boys
with fighting the likes of Gibbit here.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.240
Ow!

02:34.320 --> 02:36.040
Proper Orks have proper enemies.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.640
You need to get big and strong.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.560
Orks get big and strong
by beating the best,

02:42.640 --> 02:45.920
not by fighting grots,
even if you is going to eat them.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.240
Enemies like what boss?

02:48.720 --> 02:50.880
Hmmâ€¦ hmm...

02:50.960 --> 02:53.760
Oh, like beakees?

02:53.840 --> 02:54.840
[laughing]

02:54.920 --> 03:01.520
Well, yeah, beakees is well hard,
but I ain't talking about beakee tinboys.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.600
Oh, pointies then?

03:05.800 --> 03:10.120
They is weak,
but they is fast, and well stabby.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.720
But ain't talking about them either.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.440
You want a proper enemy.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.160
Like what the prophet hisself has got.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.840
Listen here, yoofs.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.440
We Runtherds have all the stories.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.080
I'm going tell you about Ghazghkull.

03:29.280 --> 03:33.960
I'm going to tell you about Old Bale Eye.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.440
Yeah, that's right.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.720
Bale Eye,
the meanest Ork killer of them all.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.080
Dat's him dere.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.080
A humie?!

03:48.160 --> 03:52.920
[Dursnang]
Nah, nah, nah! Not just a humie!

03:54.720 --> 03:57.160
[Dursnang] Yarrick! Old Bale Eye!

03:58.280 --> 04:03.760
[Dursnang] The greatest foe of the great
Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.000
[intense music]

04:07.920 --> 04:09.800
[Dursnang] The Beast of Armageddon,

04:09.880 --> 04:13.560
[Dursnang] the conqueror of Piscina,
Golgotha and lots of other places besides

04:13.640 --> 04:15.840
[Dursnang] the great prophet,

04:15.920 --> 04:19.200
[Dursnang] the big green, the Goffiest
Goff, the stabbiest stabber,

04:19.280 --> 04:24.000
[Dursnang] the fightiest, hardest warlord
what has ever been ever, and that is

04:24.080 --> 04:25.760
[Dursnang] a very long time.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.000
[bang]

04:27.080 --> 04:29.160
[Dursnang] And don't you forget it.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.400
[grunts]

04:30.880 --> 04:34.120
[Dursnang]
Only if you become a warlord like him,

04:34.200 --> 04:37.640
[Dursnang] can you get an enemy as good
as Old Bale Eye.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.760
[Dursnang] He's got an eye that'll burn a
hole in ya!

04:43.840 --> 04:47.960
[Dursnang] A claw that'll rip you in half!

04:48.040 --> 04:52.120
[Dursnang] Though he's a skinny runt,
he carries a gun what is so big

04:52.200 --> 04:55.280
[Dursnang] and so heavy only humie beakees
have them.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.920
[Dursnang] Why, I reckon you couldn't
carry it between you,

04:58.640 --> 05:01.240
[Dursnang] but he waves it around
like an itty bitty squig.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.520
[Dursnang] And he rides a Battlewagon
so big and so shooty,

05:05.600 --> 05:08.320
[Dursnang] an 'undred Flash Gits
couldn't take it down.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.600
Cor!

05:12.160 --> 05:13.400
[coughing]

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
[record scratch]

05:14.560 --> 05:17.440
[Dursnang] Hang on, that comes later.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.960
Y'see, even without all that,
he's well fierce.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.800
[orks roaring]

05:42.080 --> 05:44.640
[explosions]

05:44.720 --> 05:46.520
[laughing]

05:46.600 --> 05:48.280
[whirry noises]

05:53.400 --> 05:55.760
Get out of my way!

05:59.520 --> 06:01.040
Gorka! Morka!

06:01.120 --> 06:02.840
Waaagh!

06:02.920 --> 06:06.200
For the Emperor!

06:06.760 --> 06:08.200
[guns shooting]

06:08.920 --> 06:13.840
Ghazghkull nearly had the whole lot,
before Yarrick stops him.

06:14.200 --> 06:20.800
So he sends in one of his best and baddest
warbosses to sort the old man right out.

06:22.760 --> 06:29.120
Ugulhard was the biggest, toughest,
meanest Snakebite in all the horde.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.880
This is gonna be too easy!

07:00.640 --> 07:02.600
[grunts]

07:02.680 --> 07:03.960
[chainsword revving]

07:05.680 --> 07:06.840
[gunshot]

07:08.280 --> 07:09.640
[grunts]

07:20.200 --> 07:23.360
When is you humies gonna learn,

07:23.440 --> 07:27.120
this world is green!

07:27.760 --> 07:28.960
[growls]

07:29.640 --> 07:30.760
[chainsword slashes]

07:32.200 --> 07:33.400
[thuds]

07:39.920 --> 07:41.600
[revving]

07:57.400 --> 07:58.760
Like for like.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.600
Which part are you willing to give to me?

08:05.440 --> 08:06.760
[echoed screaming]

08:10.520 --> 08:11.640
[grunts]

08:15.200 --> 08:20.760
[Dursnang] Bale Eye is so tough
that he takes Ugulhard's klaw as his own.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.120
[Dursnang] Humie Mekboys fixed it up good.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.640
[machine engaging]

08:27.480 --> 08:30.600
[Dursnang] Then Bale Eye hears Orks is
scared of him,

08:30.920 --> 08:34.880
[Dursnang] and that they is saying
he can kill with a single look.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.400
[Dursnang] So he gets a shooty eye put in
and all!

08:40.440 --> 08:45.440
[Dursnang] Again and again Ghazghkull
comes to take away the humie huts,

08:53.400 --> 08:56.880
[Dursnang] but Yarrick beats them back
every time.

09:02.160 --> 09:06.320
[Dursnang] Then some beakee gits shows up
and spoils all da fun,

09:13.320 --> 09:14.920
[Dursnang] and that was that.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.800
[Dursnang] Old Ghazghkull has enough,
so he goes away.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.840
[Dursnang] But bale eye won't give up.

09:23.360 --> 09:28.880
[Dursnang] No, not him,
so chases the prophet across da sky...

09:30.120 --> 09:33.760
[Dursnang] ...to a place the humies call
Golgotha.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.320
[Dursnang] There Bale Eye finks
he has Ghazghkull caught.

09:38.400 --> 09:44.400
[Dursnang] Only that ain't it, cause
Ghazghkull is as cunning as he is brutal.

09:44.680 --> 09:45.680
[explosion]

09:46.160 --> 09:47.880
[Dursnang] It's a trap.

09:59.200 --> 10:04.680
You ain't so tough after all, is you?

10:04.760 --> 10:05.960
[laughing]

10:06.040 --> 10:09.520
Chuck him in with the rest of the humies!

10:10.440 --> 10:11.840
[laughing]

10:14.480 --> 10:17.760
[grunting]

10:23.360 --> 10:25.960
[Dursnang] He was given to us Runtherds,

10:26.040 --> 10:29.120
[Dursnang] And you knows how mean we can
be.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.400
[screams]

10:30.480 --> 10:32.200
[Dursnang] And did that finish him?

10:32.280 --> 10:33.680
[Dursnang] Did it zog.

10:33.760 --> 10:38.640
[Dursnang] It weren't long
until he was up to his usual tricks.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.120
[intense music]

10:42.200 --> 10:43.400
[flame torches]

10:51.680 --> 10:53.640
For the Emperor!

10:53.840 --> 10:55.240
[all cheering]

11:00.320 --> 11:01.480
[knives stabbing]

11:06.440 --> 11:09.680
[Dursnang] He fights his way up
to the space hulk's Dursnang hole.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.800
[explosive blasts]

11:10.880 --> 11:12.760
[Dursnang] Ghazghkull are not there.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.000
[Dursnang] But yarrick kills all da orks
he finds.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.680
[Dursnang] And that's with one arm and one
eye.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.600
He isn't here, Commissar.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.400
Destroy it.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.640
Destroy everything you can.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.560
[glass breaks]

11:30.800 --> 11:31.800
[bang]

11:33.680 --> 11:35.040
[explosion]

11:35.840 --> 11:37.160
[klaxon ringing]

11:41.120 --> 11:42.280
They're coming!

11:44.760 --> 11:45.840
[guns shooting]

11:50.320 --> 11:51.360
[growls]

11:53.000 --> 11:54.080
[explosions]

11:56.440 --> 11:57.880
For the Emperor.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.360
[grunts]

12:05.600 --> 12:07.160
For the Emperor!

12:08.040 --> 12:09.840
They say that a lot.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.880
So, what, is Bale Eye dead then?

12:13.360 --> 12:15.280
Dead? Dead?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.320
Old Bale Eye?

12:17.400 --> 12:21.480
Nah!
It takes a lot more than a cunning ambush,

12:21.560 --> 12:25.760
a good whipping, a battle
and a big explosion to kill him off.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.480
[Dursnang] Oh no, he lived alright.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.720
[screams]

12:37.800 --> 12:39.440
You. Humie.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.400
The boss wants to see you.

12:42.480 --> 12:43.960
[all yelling]

12:45.920 --> 12:50.080
[all] Bale Eye! Bale Eye! Bale Eye!

12:50.160 --> 12:52.560
[door sliding]

12:59.560 --> 13:00.800
You.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.560
Get in.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.080
[grunts]

13:05.160 --> 13:07.480
What kind of trick is this?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.360
No trick. [scuffs]

13:12.040 --> 13:15.480
Good enemies is hard to find.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.480
[laughing]

13:19.240 --> 13:23.600
So off he goes, straight back to Golgotha.

13:23.680 --> 13:28.160
[Dursnang] And he takes it right back
with some big cannon thing.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.960
[explosion and yelling]

13:31.920 --> 13:34.640
[Dursnang] And then we takes it back.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.960
Waaagh!

13:39.040 --> 13:42.400
[Dursnang] And we all thought that was
that.

13:43.560 --> 13:49.720
[Dursnang] The years go by,
and Old Bale Eye becomes even Older Bale

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
[Dursnang] Eye. Meanwhile, Ghazghkull Mag
Uruk Thraka chases his dream

13:55.080 --> 13:57.320
of the big Waaagh!

13:57.400 --> 14:02.080
[Dursnang] Across the stars,
following the voices in the great green.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.960
[Dursnang] Gork and Mork, the gods,

14:05.040 --> 14:06.840
[Dursnang] They tell him what to do,

14:06.920 --> 14:12.760
and all the time his power
grows and grows.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.760
[Dursnang] Until, one day, he comes back.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.640
[lightning crashes]

14:19.720 --> 14:20.800
[thunder booms]

14:25.640 --> 14:26.720
[eerie music]

14:46.760 --> 14:47.800
[grunts]

14:54.680 --> 14:55.680
[glass shatters]

15:03.040 --> 15:06.160
[Dursnang] Ghazghkull has a few new
tricks.

15:06.240 --> 15:11.440
[Dursnang] He teleports a bunch of boys
onto da planet.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.920
[Dursnang] And he drops massive rocks onto
the surface,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.160
[Dursnang] So we orkses can have some
forts.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.160
[bang]

15:21.600 --> 15:26.160
[Dursnang] They was impregenernab-
impregger unbeatable!

15:26.240 --> 15:30.240
[Dursnang] But not to Old Bale Eye.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.120
[machines blasting]

15:54.920 --> 15:56.760
[laughing]

15:56.840 --> 15:59.840
[explosions and guns firing]

16:11.240 --> 16:13.760
Aim! Fire!

16:17.680 --> 16:19.120
[bomb explosion]

16:24.680 --> 16:26.840
Charge!

16:30.440 --> 16:34.840
So, if you want to get bigger

16:34.920 --> 16:37.920
the proper Orks, with our enemy.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.760
You have to go and pick on something a bit
meaner than him.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.920
Why should we's listen to you?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.480
You is old, and stumpy.

16:47.800 --> 16:48.840
With that leg.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.440
Yeah, that leg!

16:51.720 --> 16:53.040
[both laughing]

16:53.120 --> 16:56.480
I bet you's got no proper enemies,
like that!

16:59.080 --> 17:01.920
You want to make an enemy out of me?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.800
[both panting]

17:06.960 --> 17:08.760
Thought not.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.080
I'll let you into a secret.

17:11.640 --> 17:16.040
Old Bale Eye is my enemy too.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.120
How'd you think I got this here?

17:20.200 --> 17:21.200
[knocking]

17:22.920 --> 17:24.160
[gun blasts]

17:27.800 --> 17:29.120
[laughing]

17:39.320 --> 17:40.720
[grunts]

17:42.720 --> 17:47.120
[Dursnang] When he comes in,
all shouting and shooting,

17:47.200 --> 17:50.080
[Dursnang] His eye blazing.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.840
[Dursnang] I fought him.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.840
[Dursnang] And I lived.

17:56.760 --> 18:03.040
[Dursnang] So don't you ever tell me
I ain't got no proper enemies.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.560
He fought Old Bale Eye?

18:08.640 --> 18:10.920
He fought Old Bale Eye!

18:11.000 --> 18:12.920
That's right, boo!

18:13.000 --> 18:15.440
[both screaming]

18:16.360 --> 18:17.360
[footsteps faing]

18:22.000 --> 18:23.040
Thanks boss.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.280
You're alright, Gibbit.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.240
For a grot.

18:28.720 --> 18:35.080
But if you ever let anyone
eat you, I'll kill you myself.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.600
-Where is he now?
-What?

18:44.680 --> 18:46.920
Old Bale Eye, where is he?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.200
What? Him?

18:49.280 --> 18:52.160
In the big black, right now.

18:52.960 --> 18:57.560
Looking for Ghazghkull, and when
he finds him,

18:57.640 --> 19:02.520
oh, when he finds him...

19:04.000 --> 19:08.360
...what a scrap that is going to be.
