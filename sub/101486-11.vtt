10:59.839 --> 11:02.708
with your snarky little remarks.
Go.

11:02.775 --> 11:05.945
An emotionally satisfying
ending.

11:06.011 --> 11:08.881
Are you sure
this is an American movie?

11:08.948 --> 11:10.616
I can't believe it.

11:10.683 --> 11:12.785
I... cared what happened.

11:14.387 --> 11:16.889
Oh. What is that thrill
I'm feeling?

11:16.956 --> 11:20.960
You are experiencing this movie
again for the first time,

11:21.026 --> 11:23.396
but through the eyes
of children.

11:23.462 --> 11:25.664
♪ ♪

11:31.137 --> 11:34.273
Oh, Homie,
that was so dangerous.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.609
I feel like Mrs. Dracula.

11:36.675 --> 11:38.511
I definitely had a...

11:38.577 --> 11:40.813
(Dracula voice):
good evening.

11:41.847 --> 11:43.582
Hey, it's locked.

11:43.649 --> 11:45.418
(gasps)
Oh, no!

11:45.484 --> 11:48.087
We're trapped
in a crypt full of...

11:48.154 --> 11:49.789
smooth jazz.

11:49.855 --> 11:51.857
(smooth jazz plays)

11:56.862 --> 11:58.631
Little known trivia:

11:58.697 --> 12:01.600
the time travel vehicle
was originally a tanning booth.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.470
- Whoa!
- That's crazy!

12:04.537 --> 12:06.972
The little ones love
your useless knowledge.

12:07.039 --> 12:10.476
Yes, my factoid will be
passed on for generations,

12:10.543 --> 12:13.546
and in that way,
I will never truly die.

12:13.612 --> 12:16.549
(sighs)
You know, maybe I was wrong

12:16.615 --> 12:20.286
to dismiss the idea
of children so... so quickly.

12:20.352 --> 12:21.987
(gasps)
Do you mean it?

12:22.054 --> 12:24.089
Hurry. Let's return
these loaner kids

12:24.156 --> 12:27.460
and go home
to make a mixed‐race nerd.

12:27.526 --> 12:31.297
Hey, shouldn't Mom and Dad
be showing up about now?

12:32.731 --> 12:36.235
Mom? Dad? Where are you?!

12:36.302 --> 12:38.604
We <i>are</i> in a cemetery,

12:38.671 --> 12:40.773
so maybe
they were attacked by zombies.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.476
Stop it! Stop saying that!

12:43.542 --> 12:45.077
(sing‐songy):
Our parents are undead.

12:45.144 --> 12:47.446
Dad will eat your head.

12:47.513 --> 12:48.781
(Lisa cries)

12:48.848 --> 12:50.282
(sinister cackling)

12:50.349 --> 12:51.517
(doors rattling)

12:51.584 --> 12:53.519
(grunting)

12:53.586 --> 12:55.754
HOMER (zombie‐like):
Let us out!

12:55.821 --> 12:58.591
Great Steve! They <i>are</i> zombies!

12:58.657 --> 13:01.093
(both yell)

13:02.528 --> 13:05.364
(both sobbing)

13:05.431 --> 13:07.600
They demand...
emotional support.

13:07.666 --> 13:09.101
You can do it.

13:09.168 --> 13:10.603
Give them comfort.

13:10.669 --> 13:12.238
(both crying)

13:12.304 --> 13:15.107
Must... act like...
loving father.

13:16.175 --> 13:17.843
I flee.

13:21.313 --> 13:23.649
But you caved!

13:25.885 --> 13:29.622
BOTH:
Mom! Dad! You're okay!

13:29.688 --> 13:30.923
Hey, where'd the dork go?

13:30.990 --> 13:32.958
Your children's emotional needs

13:33.025 --> 13:34.460
have pushed him away.

13:34.527 --> 13:37.563
If I know him, and I don't,

13:37.630 --> 13:39.298
I'm sure he'll be back.

13:39.365 --> 13:43.702
No. He has run to a place
where there is no hope.

13:49.842 --> 13:52.478
I have returned. Forever.

13:52.545 --> 13:55.814
Your room is unchanged...
as are your sheets.

14:02.288 --> 14:04.557
So... your husband ran away
to his childhood home,

14:05.331 --> 14:07.000
leaving you alone.

14:07.066 --> 14:09.102
Maybe forever.
Also, childless.

14:09.168 --> 14:10.403
(groans)

14:10.470 --> 14:12.572
I'm sure you're experiencing

14:12.639 --> 14:14.774
a lot of feelings right now.

14:14.841 --> 14:16.809
It's okay to let them out.

14:16.876 --> 14:19.078
(inhales and exhales loudly)

14:19.145 --> 14:22.181
I hate you,
you shameless womb tease!

14:22.248 --> 14:24.117
You're like a baby drug dealer!

14:24.183 --> 14:27.320
You give me a taste,
and now I'm hooked!

14:27.387 --> 14:29.122
This is on you, too!

14:29.188 --> 14:31.958
You've crushed
my only chance at happiness,

14:32.025 --> 14:34.594
you ape‐faced
cheeseburger goblin!

14:34.661 --> 14:37.130
(muffled whimper)

14:37.196 --> 14:38.631
Make this right.

14:38.698 --> 14:40.700
Bring back my husband!

14:47.373 --> 14:50.343
Whoa. So this is where
Comic Book Guy grew up.

14:50.410 --> 14:53.880
We'll finally see what kind
of "its" created a "that."

14:53.946 --> 14:55.214
(doorbell rings)

14:55.281 --> 14:57.150
- (door squeaks open)
- (both yelp)

14:57.216 --> 15:01.387
Ah, you must be delivering
my 1912 Polish coronation stamp.

15:01.454 --> 15:03.089
Actually,
we're looking for someone

15:03.156 --> 15:05.124
we call "Comic Book Guy."

15:05.191 --> 15:08.928
Enter.
My son is in here... somewhere.

15:08.995 --> 15:12.131
Oh, well, thank you, Mr., uh...

15:12.198 --> 15:15.335
You may refer to me
as "Postage Stamp Fellow."

15:19.172 --> 15:21.407
What is this crazy place?

15:26.879 --> 15:28.314
<i>BOB BALABAN:
This crazy place</i>

15:28.381 --> 15:30.016
<i>is Comic Book Guy's
childhood home.</i>

15:30.083 --> 15:32.085
<i>An only child,
he grew up surrounded</i>

15:32.151 --> 15:36.022
<i>by an eccentric extended family
of childless aunts and uncles.</i>

15:36.089 --> 15:39.325
<i>However, his family poured their
love into their collections,</i>

15:39.392 --> 15:42.762
<i>instead of into the lonely
little boy wandering the halls.</i>

15:42.829 --> 15:46.532
<i>His aunt collected taxidermized
chestnut‐tailed starlings,</i>

15:46.599 --> 15:49.769
<i>causing her to form a tacit
alliance with her twin brother,</i>

15:49.836 --> 15:52.038
<i>who collected
brutalist birdhouses.</i>

15:54.240 --> 15:55.975
<i>His great step‐uncle,</i>

15:56.042 --> 15:58.378
<i>who had once had his heart
broken by a meter maid,</i>

15:58.444 --> 16:01.981
<i>was a gatherer of discredited
obstetric equipment,</i>

16:02.048 --> 16:03.616
<i>while his younger dowager aunt</i>

16:03.683 --> 16:06.119
<i>collected antique
Chinese cricket boxes</i>

16:06.185 --> 16:07.820
<i>and filled them
with live crickets,</i>

16:07.887 --> 16:09.989
<i>who frequently escaped.</i>

16:10.056 --> 16:11.767
- (cricket chirping)
<i>- The only thing of value</i>

16:11.791 --> 16:14.994
<i>the family did not display
in the home was love.</i>

16:15.061 --> 16:17.630
<i>And the love he sought most
was that of his father,</i>

16:17.697 --> 16:20.633
<i>who spent his days
as an avid philatelist.</i>

16:23.302 --> 16:26.172
(sighs sadly)

16:36.649 --> 16:40.453
Mint. Mint.
Near mint. Very fine.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.089
Hi, um, there.

16:43.156 --> 16:46.626
Maybe you might feel better
if you came home with us?

16:46.692 --> 16:48.261
I am home.
From now on,

16:48.327 --> 16:50.930
my only companion is
my comic book collection.

16:50.997 --> 16:52.965
Mint. Mint. Near mint.

16:53.032 --> 16:55.034
- Gem mint. Mint. Mint...
- (Marge sighs)

16:55.101 --> 16:57.870
- Look at the sad little boy.
- Mint. Mint. Mint. Mint.

16:57.937 --> 17:00.506
- Is that you?
- Mint. Mint.

17:00.573 --> 17:03.109
Worst... day... ever!

17:03.176 --> 17:06.879
There's got to be more
to this story.

17:06.946 --> 17:08.614
<i>BOB BALABAN:
There was more to this story.</i>

17:10.650 --> 17:13.786
<i>Without anyone to play with, the
lonely boy turned to baseball.</i>

17:13.853 --> 17:15.888
<i>His favorite pitcher
was Sandy Koufax,</i>

17:15.955 --> 17:18.991
<i>and he perfected a curveball
of rare devastation.</i>

17:19.058 --> 17:22.595
<i>However, his team
would never give him a chance.</i>

17:22.662 --> 17:24.597
<i>But on the day
before the big game,</i>

17:24.664 --> 17:27.600
<i>all the starting pitchers were
injured in a multi‐canoe pile‐up</i>

17:27.667 --> 17:31.404
<i>caused by the sighting of an
unusually large lake sturgeon.</i>

17:33.539 --> 17:35.741
<i>He got the call to pitch.</i>

17:35.808 --> 17:37.928
<i>His dearest hope was that
his father would finally see</i>

17:37.977 --> 17:40.179
<i>his masterful curveball
in action.</i>

17:40.246 --> 17:42.982
<i>But during the biggest moment
of his young life,</i>

17:43.049 --> 17:46.185
<i>his dad was nowhere to be seen.</i>

18:10.276 --> 18:11.978
<i>He escaped his sadness</i>

18:12.044 --> 18:15.481
<i>into a world of heroes,
villains and Jugheads.</i>

18:18.651 --> 18:22.388
<i>In that moment, he became more
than a boy but less than a man.</i>

18:23.723 --> 18:26.192
<i>He became Comic Book Guy.</i>

18:27.827 --> 18:29.962
<i>Marge then confronted
Postage Stamp Fellow</i>

18:30.029 --> 18:32.932
<i>about this life‐changing
incident with his son.</i>

18:32.999 --> 18:35.034
What? Oh. Okay.

18:37.904 --> 18:41.073
Why weren't you there
for your son when he needed you?

18:41.140 --> 18:43.776
This is not a family
to rummage through the past.

18:43.843 --> 18:45.678
Emotionally.

18:45.745 --> 18:48.748
You tell me why you didn't go
to your son's baseball game,

18:48.814 --> 18:50.149
or I'll lick it.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.817
My Inverted Dendermonde?

18:51.884 --> 18:53.185
You wouldn't dare!

18:53.252 --> 18:54.921
(whimpering)

18:54.987 --> 18:56.298
All right, all right!
I'll tell you!

18:56.322 --> 18:58.357
I was buying him that.

19:01.527 --> 19:03.963
Go ahead. Tell him.

19:04.030 --> 19:05.932
I didn't go to your game,

19:05.998 --> 19:07.934
because I was afraid
if you lost,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.403
I wouldn't know how
to comfort you.

19:10.469 --> 19:12.972
So I supported you
the only way I knew how.

19:13.039 --> 19:14.740
I purchased you a collectible.

19:14.807 --> 19:16.776
Which I never had the heart
to give you.

19:16.842 --> 19:19.579

Sandy Koufax,

19:19.645 --> 19:21.747
the left arm of God!

19:21.814 --> 19:24.917
Son, perhaps we should
do something we've never done.

19:24.984 --> 19:26.452
Have a catch?

19:26.519 --> 19:28.387
I think I would like that.

19:32.291 --> 19:34.126
- Ow!
<i>- Ow!</i>

19:34.193 --> 19:38.097
Everyone,

19:42.201 --> 19:43.836

- Ow.

19:43.903 --> 19:48.741
Well, maybe Comic Book Guy won't
be so afraid to be a father.

19:48.808 --> 19:50.109
(chuckles)

19:50.176 --> 19:51.811
Sucker.
