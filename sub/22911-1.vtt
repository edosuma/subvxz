38:28.003 --> 38:30.407
Right, we're all here.

38:30.407 --> 38:33.110
Let's get it sorted.
- Frank,

38:33.110 --> 38:34.644
I don't know
about everybody else,

38:34.644 --> 38:38.115
but right now, I am not happy.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.783
I've had enough.

38:39.783 --> 38:42.819
The other night,
two of my boys outside

38:42.819 --> 38:44.121
Antonio's restaurant,

38:44.121 --> 38:47.924
they get shot
by your people.

38:47.924 --> 38:49.726
- Eh, and Crow.

38:49.726 --> 38:51.428
He's in danger.

38:51.428 --> 38:53.497
These are my familia.

38:53.497 --> 38:57.134
- I've had a word with Crow.

38:57.134 --> 38:59.536
And Diesal.

38:59.536 --> 39:03.573
And I can assure you,
it won't be happening again.

39:03.573 --> 39:06.041
- Well, Frank, let me tell you
something.

39:06.041 --> 39:08.745
If I see Diesal on my manor,

39:08.745 --> 39:11.448
I will personally
cut his balls off.

39:11.448 --> 39:13.049
- You won't.

39:13.049 --> 39:14.418
- Okay.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.453
- Listen guys,

39:16.453 --> 39:17.021
I've got
this all under control.

39:18.021 --> 39:19.656
- Yeah,
but it doesn't feel like

39:19.656 --> 39:21.525
you got it under control
Frank.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.794
- What about the police
Frank?

39:23.794 --> 39:25.029
My boys can't go through
the door at the moment

39:26.029 --> 39:28.999
without falling over coppers.

39:28.999 --> 39:31.668
You're supposed to have
the police pinned down.

39:31.668 --> 39:33.437
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

39:33.437 --> 39:35.807
- Lenny, listen to me.

39:36.807 --> 39:39.509
We've got the police
right where we need them.

39:39.509 --> 39:41.778
- Well, it doesn't feel
like it, Frank.

39:41.778 --> 39:44.748
- You cost us money, Frank.
- Frank, what about the gear?

39:44.748 --> 39:47.050
Nobody wants it.
- Can't sell it Frank.

39:47.050 --> 39:48.652
- It's substandard.

39:48.652 --> 39:50.921
- Frank, let me explain
something to you.

39:50.921 --> 39:53.557
The transportation, the first
lot that comes through

39:53.557 --> 39:55.058
is proper gear.

39:55.058 --> 39:57.694
This second lot--it's been
stamped on, it's cut.

39:57.694 --> 40:01.933
- And the merchandise
is always late.

40:02.933 --> 40:05.669
- I've had a word
with the military.

40:05.669 --> 40:09.673
The gear...won't be late.

40:09.673 --> 40:12.711
The gear...will be A grade.

40:14.711 --> 40:17.681
And it won't be stamped on.

40:17.681 --> 40:19.850
And it won't be cut.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.085
Trust me.

40:22.085 --> 40:24.491
(indistinct chatter)

40:27.491 --> 40:28.758
- Shokka.
- Sit down.

40:28.758 --> 40:31.561
- Oh lads, calm down.
Shokka.

40:31.561 --> 40:33.697
What the fuck are you doing?
- Do you know

40:33.697 --> 40:35.098
where to find out
who killed my little brother?

40:35.098 --> 40:37.234
- Shokka, get that gun

40:37.234 --> 40:38.702
out of my face.

40:38.702 --> 40:40.637
- I'm not gonna
ask you again.

40:40.637 --> 40:42.572
- You know me.

40:42.572 --> 40:43.007
Shokka, you know me.

40:44.007 --> 40:46.977
- When I left,
I knew you had it in for me.

40:46.977 --> 40:48.612
So you got my brother.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.247
I knew you wanted me dead,
Frank.

40:50.247 --> 40:52.716
- If I wanted you dead,

40:52.716 --> 40:55.050
you'd be dead a long time ago.

40:55.050 --> 40:57.220
I wouldn't need to kill
your little brother.

40:57.220 --> 40:58.855
- So what was it
with the message?

40:58.855 --> 41:01.191
- That was for you to
come back and join me.

41:01.191 --> 41:02.792
- Don't lie to me Frank.

41:02.792 --> 41:05.161
- I'm not lying, Shokka.

41:05.161 --> 41:08.098
You left me.
Remember?

41:08.098 --> 41:09.866
- You better tell me
before I kill you.

41:09.866 --> 41:12.702
- If you was gonna kill me,

41:12.702 --> 41:14.738
you'd have done it already.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.741
I told you, I don't know.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.809
- I just wanna know who
killed my little brother.

41:19.809 --> 41:22.612
- You go look on the road.

41:22.612 --> 41:24.556
You'll find your answer.

41:32.556 --> 41:35.894
(background chatter)

41:37.894 --> 41:39.829
- Fam, yeah.

41:39.829 --> 41:41.698
- Does Shokka know
you're here?

41:41.698 --> 41:43.934
- Fuck Shokka man--don't
need to know about nothing.

41:43.934 --> 41:45.969
- What do you mean
fuck Shokka, bro?

41:45.969 --> 41:49.205
If he finds out, me and him are
going to fall out, you know.

41:49.205 --> 41:51.942
- Relax man, he's not going
to find out about anything.

41:51.942 --> 41:54.945
- What do you mean relax,
bro?

41:54.945 --> 41:58.682
(ominous chords)

41:58.682 --> 42:00.617

42:03.219 --> 42:07.958
(speaking foreign language)

42:07.958 --> 42:10.193
- Nah he's all right.
You're all right, innit?

42:10.193 --> 42:11.027
- Yeah, I'm blessed.

42:12.027 --> 42:13.634
- He's blessed.

42:17.634 --> 42:20.203
- Watchin' I you.

42:20.203 --> 42:22.205
Remember that.

42:22.205 --> 42:24.809
Bumbaclot.

42:25.809 --> 42:27.911
- You think I need a bossy
little man like you

42:27.911 --> 42:30.814
on my team?
You're not like us.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.682
- Now come on Diesal, man.

42:32.682 --> 42:35.318
Can't we make some serious
money now man?

42:35.318 --> 42:37.354
None of the small gun change
with it.

42:37.354 --> 42:39.054
You gonna help me or not?

42:39.054 --> 42:44.260
(ominous chords continue)

42:44.260 --> 42:46.797
- What are you doing now?

42:47.797 --> 42:49.799
- Just about to drop off
some grams still.

42:49.799 --> 42:51.368
- Why don't you go fuck off
and drop off

42:51.368 --> 42:53.136
your little grams then?
- Come on Diesal.

42:53.136 --> 42:54.005
I'll do your thing
first, obviously.

42:55.005 --> 42:58.944
- "Do my thing--do my thing.
do my thing first."

43:00.944 --> 43:02.979
You know what?
I'm going to help you

43:02.979 --> 43:04.881
because Shokka's you're
little brother, and I like you.

43:04.881 --> 43:06.182
- Yeah, come tell me
what you want me to do.

43:06.182 --> 43:07.919
I'll do it now.

43:09.919 --> 43:12.294
- Ninja,
let my man do the thing.

43:18.294 --> 43:20.664
- Take this.

43:20.664 --> 43:25.269
Remember...no fuck up.

43:26.269 --> 43:28.104
- Are you listening?

43:28.104 --> 43:29.205
- Yeah.

43:29.205 --> 43:31.808
- You know Oldbury, yeah?

43:31.808 --> 43:33.010
Gonna cross over the
little motorway bridge

43:34.010 --> 43:37.079
and you see them in
the little white building.

43:37.079 --> 43:38.682
No fuck-ups, though.

43:38.682 --> 43:41.386
- There won't be
no fuck-ups, man.

43:43.386 --> 43:45.221
- Ey.

43:45.221 --> 43:47.290
No fuck-ups.

43:47.290 --> 43:48.458
- Yo, who's that?

43:48.458 --> 43:49.926
- Yes, Thuggy, Shokka.

43:49.926 --> 43:51.327
- What's going on, Shokka bro?

43:51.327 --> 43:52.796
Long time. man.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.698
- A lot's been happening, bro.

43:54.698 --> 43:57.099
- Yo, I heard.
Sending my condolences.

43:57.099 --> 43:58.902
- Yeah, I know.

43:58.902 --> 44:00.003
You know I'm going to find
out who did this, innit?

44:01.003 --> 44:03.072
Any news?
- Yeah, mate,

44:03.072 --> 44:04.908
I know something.
- Well, listen then.

44:04.908 --> 44:07.711
Meet me by the riverside
in ten.

44:07.711 --> 44:10.346
- All right, cool, cool.
(murmurs)

44:10.346 --> 44:14.184
(edgy instrumentals)

44:14.184 --> 44:17.056
- Are you still stressing
over Shokka?

44:21.056 --> 44:23.126
Come on, if you was
in his shoes...

44:23.126 --> 44:26.061
- What do you mean
if I was in his shoes?

44:26.061 --> 44:29.299
- Well what would you think?
- The fuck do you know?

44:29.299 --> 44:31.747
I don't know, innit?

44:43.747 --> 44:47.317
- (sighs)
Thuggy, I swear bruth,

44:47.317 --> 44:50.187
I need to find out
who killed my brother.

44:51.187 --> 44:53.957
- So what, the police
don't know nothing?

44:53.957 --> 44:56.359
- They're saying
it's drug related.

44:56.359 --> 44:58.795
They haven't done
nothin'.

44:58.795 --> 45:00.897
- Tuk weren't no drug dealer.

45:00.897 --> 45:02.398
- Even I know that.

45:02.398 --> 45:04.834
You know the road.

45:04.834 --> 45:07.074
Don't make any sense
to me.

45:12.074 --> 45:15.378
Just before my pops
passed away,

45:15.378 --> 45:17.280
I made him a promise.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.249
- What was that?

45:19.249 --> 45:21.018
- I told him I'd take care
of my family

45:22.018 --> 45:25.155
and make sure
they're always safe.

45:25.155 --> 45:27.858
I've messed up, man.
I've failed.

45:28.858 --> 45:31.795
- You and Tukka
are like family to me.

45:31.795 --> 45:33.799
So what do you want to do
really?

45:35.799 --> 45:38.401
- Find them.
Get them.

45:38.401 --> 45:40.003
And kill them.

45:41.003 --> 45:43.907
- This is what
we're gonna do, yeah?

45:43.907 --> 45:45.542
Every drug dealer in the city,

45:45.542 --> 45:47.811
no matter if they sell
a five pound drum

45:47.811 --> 45:49.279
or a metric ton.

45:49.279 --> 45:52.549
Everybody's gonna get
the fucking shake up.
