01:33.894 --> 01:38.163
at the national finals

01:38.165 --> 01:41.433
Hello, everyone, I'm Matt Iseman
along with Akbar Gbajabiamila,

01:41.435 --> 01:44.436
and, partner, it is time for
the second half of our field

01:44.438 --> 01:47.372
to take on this unrelenting
gauntlet of obstacles

01:47.374 --> 01:49.174
we call stage one.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.610
<i>- Well, Matt, last week
only eight athletes</i>

01:51.612 --> 01:53.245
<i>finished this
challenging course,</i>

01:53.247 --> 01:55.214
<i>putting us on pace
for the lowest number</i>

01:55.216 --> 01:57.583
<i>of stage one finishers ever.</i>

01:57.585 --> 01:59.718
<i>The question is,
will tonight's competitors</i>

01:59.720 --> 02:01.520
<i>learn from last week's
mistakes?</i>

02:01.522 --> 02:04.623
<i>Don't bet against
sports cameraman Geoff Britten.</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:06.458
<i>The first man
to conquer the mountain</i>

02:06.460 --> 02:08.926
<i>is ready
for a repeat performance.</i>

02:08.929 --> 02:11.029
<i>- Geoff Britten did it!</i>

02:11.031 --> 02:14.466
<i>- Plus, Meagan Martin
is having her best season ever,</i>

02:14.468 --> 02:16.168
<i>and she wants to become</i>

02:16.170 --> 02:18.604
<i>the second woman
to complete stage one.</i>

02:18.606 --> 02:20.038
<i>- And she does it!</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:21.840
<i>- Night two also features</i>

02:21.842 --> 02:25.511
<i>the Real Life Ninja
Drew Drechsel...</i>

02:25.513 --> 02:27.646
<i>the weatherman Joe Moravsky...</i>

02:27.648 --> 02:29.248
<i>- Whoo, airborne.</i>

02:29.250 --> 02:31.984
<i>- Pioneer Kacy Catanzaro...</i>

02:31.986 --> 02:33.418
<i>- Look at that reach.</i>

02:33.420 --> 02:35.854
<i>- And the unpredictable
Jake Murray.</i>

02:35.856 --> 02:38.824
<i>- He is a showman.</i>

02:38.826 --> 02:41.260
To give you a tour of
the stage one obstacles,

02:41.262 --> 02:43.328
let's go down to
Kristine Leahy.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.164
- Matt, thank you.
- Just like last week,

02:45.166 --> 02:47.232
stage one is made up
of eight obstacles,

02:47.234 --> 02:50.035
and in order to advance,
our competitors must complete it

02:50.037 --> 02:52.437
in under
2 minutes and 20 seconds.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.805
It all starts right behind me

02:53.807 --> 02:56.408
<i>with our new
first obstacle, Snake Run.</i>

02:56.410 --> 02:58.443
<i>Last week,
this tricky balance obstacle</i>

02:58.445 --> 03:01.547
<i>shockingly ended the season
of ninja legend Travis Rosen.</i>

03:01.549 --> 03:03.015
<i>- Whoa, no!</i>

03:03.017 --> 03:05.684
<i>- The Propeller Bar
took out 11 competitors,</i>

03:05.686 --> 03:07.986
<i>including one of the favorites,
Ian Dory.</i>

03:07.988 --> 03:10.589
<i>- Oh!
- Oh! "Finding Dory!"</i>

03:10.591 --> 03:13.358
<i>- The Giant Log Grip provided
more shocking moments,</i>

03:13.360 --> 03:16.828
<i>throwing off popular ninjas
Jamie Rahn and Kevin Bull.</i>

03:16.830 --> 03:19.164
<i>- Oh!
- What?</i>

03:19.166 --> 03:22.201
<i>- The Jumping Spider
is as dangerous as ever,</i>

03:22.203 --> 03:24.536
<i>as six-time national finalist
James McGrath found out.</i>

03:24.538 --> 03:28.407
<i>- Get it! Hold it! No, H2O!</i>

03:28.409 --> 03:31.910
<i>- Sonic Curve returns, testing
their footwork and timing...</i>

03:31.912 --> 03:33.245
<i>- Ride that swing.</i>

03:33.247 --> 03:35.514
<i>- Followed by
the 14-foot Warped Wall</i>

03:35.516 --> 03:38.884
<i>but with only half the run-up
of the regular season.</i>

03:38.886 --> 03:40.085
<i>Broken Bridge is new...</i>

03:40.087 --> 03:41.587
<i>- Ooh, ooh, ooh.</i>

03:41.589 --> 03:44.323
<i>- As is our final obstacle,
the Flying Squirrel.</i>

03:44.325 --> 03:45.724
<i>Competitors will have to</i>

03:45.726 --> 03:47.859
<i>swing through two sets of
free-floating handles</i>

03:47.861 --> 03:48.894
<i>and climb the cargo net</i>

03:48.896 --> 03:51.163
<i>like Jessie Graff
making history</i>

03:51.165 --> 03:54.366
<i>as the first woman
to conquer stage one.</i>

03:54.368 --> 03:57.169
<i>- Jessie Graff has done it!</i>

03:57.171 --> 03:58.470
<i>- If competitors
can hit the buzzer</i>

03:58.472 --> 04:00.739
in under 2 minutes
and 20 seconds,

04:00.741 --> 04:02.507
they're moving on to stage two.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.643
- Guys?
<i>- Thanks, Kristine.</i>

04:04.645 --> 04:06.645
<i>To see how these obstacles
were developed,</i>

04:06.647 --> 04:08.814
<i>check out
the NBC digital exclusive</i>

04:08.816 --> 04:10.282
<i>"Crashing the Course"</i>

04:10.284 --> 04:13.652
<i>at
facebook.com/NBCNinjaWarrior.</i>

04:13.654 --> 04:16.622
<i>- Well, Jessie Graff
made history last week</i>

04:16.624 --> 04:18.923
<i>on stage one,
and kicking things off tonight,</i>

04:18.926 --> 04:20.858
<i>another strong
female competitor.</i>

04:20.861 --> 04:24.730
<i>It's Kirsti Pratt,
better known as "The Machine."</i>

04:24.732 --> 04:26.665
<i>You may recall she scaled
a salmon ladder</i>

04:26.667 --> 04:29.301
<i>on her wedding day in her gown.</i>

04:29.303 --> 04:32.104
<i>Well, now the groom
has caught the bug.</i>

04:32.106 --> 04:33.572
<i>- My husband, Mickel,</i>

04:33.574 --> 04:35.374
<i>has now started getting
into obstacle training.</i>

04:35.376 --> 04:36.541
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.944
<i>The wedding had something
to do with it,</i>

04:38.946 --> 04:42.114
but my run in Indy definitely
sparked Mike's interest.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.518
<i>- No one has gotten
past this obstacle tonight.</i>

04:46.520 --> 04:47.486
<i>Can she be the first?</i>

04:47.488 --> 04:50.155
<i>- Oh!
- Yes!</i>

04:50.157 --> 04:52.090
<i>- I get to see
how much fun she has.</i>

04:52.092 --> 04:53.959
<i>I've started to want to
train with her</i>

04:53.961 --> 04:56.194
to become, you know, a ninja.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.629
- Quick, quick, quick, quick.
- Come on.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.799
<i>Training my husband Mike
helps us bond closer together.</i>

05:00.801 --> 05:02.267
<i>We get to spend
more time together.</i>

05:02.269 --> 05:03.535
<i>This is something he's new to,</i>

05:03.537 --> 05:05.704
<i>and I get to share the love
for the sport</i>

05:05.706 --> 05:07.005
with the love of my life.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.475
<i>- And there's her husband
Mickel</i>

05:10.477 --> 05:13.245
<i>here to cheer her on
and a whole group of family</i>

05:13.247 --> 05:17.182
<i>and friends who made the trip
all the way from St. Louis.</i>

05:17.184 --> 05:21.086
<i>- It's time to fire up
The Machine.</i>

05:21.088 --> 05:23.455
<i>- Kirsti the first tonight
to take on Snake Run.</i>

05:23.457 --> 05:26.491
<i>These eight angled steps
not as easy as they look.</i>

05:26.493 --> 05:29.227
<i>They took out three competitors
last week.</i>

05:29.229 --> 05:30.829
<i>But she's through.</i>

05:30.831 --> 05:32.230
<i>Now the Propeller Bar,</i>

05:32.232 --> 05:34.833
<i>always a challenge
for the female athletes.</i>

05:34.835 --> 05:36.702
<i>- She's got that fight in her.</i>

05:36.704 --> 05:38.804
<i>You saw the way she attacked
that trampoline.</i>

05:38.806 --> 05:42.140
<i>That was a nice high leap
to the propeller.</i>

05:42.142 --> 05:44.142
<i>- Kirsti trains more than
20 hours a week</i>

05:44.144 --> 05:45.844
<i>on ninja obstacles</i>

05:45.846 --> 05:47.813
<i>but probably never
seen a Propeller Bar.</i>

05:47.815 --> 05:49.348
<i>But she's through.</i>

05:49.350 --> 05:50.949
<i>- I see you, Kirsti.</i>

05:50.951 --> 05:52.417
<i>Just like in your
wedding dress.</i>

05:52.419 --> 05:54.252
<i>If you can train
in your wedding dress,</i>

05:54.254 --> 05:56.621
<i>you know you can come out here
and compete on stage one.</i>

05:56.623 --> 05:59.191
- Breathe, sweetie!
- Come on, keep breathing!

05:59.193 --> 06:00.425
<i>- But now the Giant Log Grip.</i>

06:00.427 --> 06:03.161
<i>Only two women made it
past this last week.</i>

06:03.163 --> 06:05.530
<i>- This is more than
50 feet down this track</i>

06:05.532 --> 06:07.833
<i>with a bunch of big drops.</i>

06:07.835 --> 06:10.235
<i>- And Kirsti makes it three!
- Wow, did you see that?</i>

06:10.237 --> 06:11.536
<i>- What balance.</i>

06:11.538 --> 06:12.871
<i>- It's like she planned
that all the way.</i>

06:12.873 --> 06:14.706
<i>She... look... she's shocked.</i>

06:14.708 --> 06:17.142
<i>- Now The Machine giving us
our first look tonight</i>

06:17.144 --> 06:18.310
<i>at the Jumping Spider.</i>

06:18.312 --> 06:20.412
- Let's go!
- Hit it with conviction!

06:20.414 --> 06:21.713
<i>- Jessie Graff
and Meagan Martin</i>

06:21.715 --> 06:23.682
<i>the only two women
ever to complete it.</i>

06:23.684 --> 06:26.618
<i>- She's been practicing
on this obstacle in her gym.</i>

06:26.620 --> 06:30.355
<i>- No!
- Oh, no!</i>

06:30.357 --> 06:34.159
<i>- And The Machine malfunctions
on the Jumping Spider.</i>

06:34.161 --> 06:36.528
<i>- You want to land
your feet in here</i>

06:36.530 --> 06:39.030
<i>where the walls
are only 48 inches apart.</i>

06:39.032 --> 06:41.266
<i>But watch where
The Machine's feet land,</i>

06:41.268 --> 06:43.101
<i>way back here
where the opening's</i>

06:43.103 --> 06:46.104
<i>at its widest point
at 58 inches.</i>

06:46.106 --> 06:48.373
<i>At 5'4", she couldn't
quite stick it.</i>

06:48.375 --> 06:51.309
- I just popped too... too early.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.578
<i>Should have waited
a little longer.</i>

06:53.580 --> 06:56.348
<i>- Well, no one has made
a longer trip to get here</i>

06:56.350 --> 06:57.716
<i>than our next competitor.</i>

06:57.718 --> 07:00.285
<i>From the tiny village
of Unalakleet, Alaska,</i>

07:00.287 --> 07:02.120
<i>this is Nick Hanson,</i>

07:02.122 --> 07:04.356
<i>better known
as the "Eskimo Ninja."</i>

07:04.358 --> 07:06.191
<i>And Nick's success is breeding</i>

07:06.193 --> 07:09.194
<i>a whole generation
of northern ninjas.</i>

07:09.196 --> 07:13.265
<i>Nick Hanson the Eskimo Ninja.</i>

07:13.267 --> 07:14.933
<i>- Last year was my first time</i>

07:14.935 --> 07:17.035
<i>participating
in "Ninja Warrior,"</i>

07:17.037 --> 07:18.603
and it was a real honor
to have that chance

07:18.605 --> 07:21.640
to represent my state
and my culture...

07:21.642 --> 07:24.242
<i>- He's loving it,
and so are his fans.</i>

07:24.244 --> 07:25.677
<i>- But now I'm starting to learn</i>

07:25.679 --> 07:29.247
<i>a lot of the kids around here
really look up to me.</i>

07:29.249 --> 07:32.851
Oh, dang!
That's so close.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.453
<i>- The kids love Nick.</i>

07:34.455 --> 07:36.888
- Nicholas
wants to be a teacher.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.156
- Hi!
- Can you guys show me

07:38.158 --> 07:39.591
how it's done?
Show me how it's done.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.625
- Ow!

07:40.627 --> 07:42.394
<i>- He coaches all the sports...</i>

07:42.396 --> 07:44.763
- Lift your legs up
off the floor.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.167
- And I wouldn't be surprised
if there's gonna be

07:49.169 --> 07:52.237
some ninja warriors
coming from this village.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.272
- Yeah! We're all ninjas.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.876
It is such an amazing feeling

07:57.878 --> 07:59.911
to have that kind of support
from my community.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.947
<i>- A big group of supporters
here</i>

08:01.949 --> 08:04.115
<i>came down from Alaska
to watch.</i>

08:04.117 --> 08:05.650
<i>- It's not just
a journey for myself.</i>

08:05.652 --> 08:07.452
<i>It's a journey for all of us,
and I'm just glad</i>

08:07.454 --> 08:08.653
<i>that I get to be the person</i>

08:08.655 --> 08:10.689
that gets to do it
for all of them.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.591
Whoo!

08:14.461 --> 08:16.428
<i>- Well, the only folks
not watching</i>

08:16.430 --> 08:18.430
<i>back in Unalakleet
are here tonight,</i>

08:18.432 --> 08:20.732
<i>including his girlfriend
and his mom.</i>

08:20.734 --> 08:22.267
- Go, Nick!
- You got this!

08:22.269 --> 08:24.002
<i>- Okay, let's go, Eskimo.</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:27.572
<i>- In the L.A. city finals,
Hanson made it</i>

08:27.574 --> 08:30.075
<i>to the eighth obstacle
before going down</i>

08:30.077 --> 08:33.278
<i>but got far enough fast enough
to make the top 15.</i>

08:33.280 --> 08:35.714
<i>Hanson now at
the Propeller Bar.</i>

08:35.716 --> 08:36.881
<i>- The Eskimo Ninja.</i>

08:36.884 --> 08:40.150
<i>He's become a sensation
on the Internet</i>

08:40.153 --> 08:43.955
<i>from his runs here,
his personality.</i>

08:43.957 --> 08:45.023
<i>- They loved him
up in Alaska too.</i>

08:45.025 --> 08:46.558
- Hang on, Nick! Hold on!

08:46.560 --> 08:48.693
<i>- Hanson has proven
his Ninja skills this year,</i>

08:48.695 --> 08:50.629
<i>but he is an Olympic stud</i>

08:50.631 --> 08:53.164
<i>in the World
Eskimo-Indian Olympics,</i>

08:53.166 --> 08:54.866
<i>has held world records
in events</i>

08:54.868 --> 08:57.269
<i>like the Toe Kick
and the Knuckle Hop.</i>

08:57.271 --> 08:59.471
<i>- Well, shoot, now he better
hold on here.</i>

08:59.473 --> 09:01.806
<i>- Trying the technique
we saw last week,</i>

09:01.808 --> 09:03.108
<i>waiting for the log to settle.</i>

09:03.110 --> 09:05.677
<i>It's safer
but eats up more time.</i>

09:05.679 --> 09:07.279
<i>A little stumble there,</i>

09:07.281 --> 09:09.781
<i>but look at that... a point.
He is confident.</i>

09:09.783 --> 09:11.917
<i>This guy's built four new
obstacles in his backyard</i>

09:11.919 --> 09:14.319
<i>out of driftwood
he found on the Alaskan shore.</i>

09:14.321 --> 09:15.487
<i>- Get inside of that alley.</i>

09:15.489 --> 09:16.621
<i>- Ooh!
- Whoa!</i>

09:16.623 --> 09:18.456
<i>- That is a smooth
recovery there.</i>

09:18.458 --> 09:20.292
<i>- It really was.
- He's ready to fight inside</i>

09:20.294 --> 09:21.626
<i>of this alley
of the Jumping Spider.</i>

09:21.628 --> 09:23.461
<i>- Yeah, but you can see
those feet slipping here.</i>

09:23.463 --> 09:25.330
<i>- Such a dangerous alley.</i>

09:25.332 --> 09:27.632
<i>- Well, not a lot of spiders
up in Alaska,</i>

09:27.634 --> 09:29.901
<i>but no problem for Nick Hanson.</i>

09:29.903 --> 09:32.237
- You got it!

09:32.239 --> 09:35.040
<i>- The Eskimo Ninja
now the first tonight</i>

09:35.042 --> 09:37.809
<i>to take on Sonic Curve,
six angled steps,</i>

09:37.811 --> 09:39.945
<i>then a jump
to a swinging rope.</i>

09:39.947 --> 09:43.148
<i>Remember, unlike the regular
seasons, stage one is timed.</i>

09:43.150 --> 09:46.151
<i>Only 2 minutes, 20 seconds
to complete the course.</i>

09:46.153 --> 09:47.686
<i>- Well, under a minute,
Akbar.</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:49.187
<i>Three obstacles left.</i>

09:49.189 --> 09:51.156
<i>- Well, you know, and the hard
thing about this Warped Wall</i>

09:51.158 --> 09:53.391
<i>is there's the shorter run-up,
so you have to be able</i>

09:53.393 --> 09:54.492
<i>to make the most of it...
- Ooh!</i>

09:54.494 --> 09:56.728
<i>- Like that!</i>

09:56.730 --> 09:58.964
- Pick it up!
- Pick it up!

09:58.966 --> 10:02.300
<i>- Now the first tonight
to take on Broken Bridge.</i>

10:02.302 --> 10:05.303
<i>- All right, check yourself
before you wreck yourself.</i>

10:05.305 --> 10:06.638
<i>- Ooh!
- Good balance!</i>

10:06.640 --> 10:08.873
<i>- Ooh, wiggling
like Jell-O there.</i>

10:08.875 --> 10:10.575
<i>- Well, it seems like
a lot of time left,</i>

10:10.577 --> 10:11.743
<i>but we saw last week</i>

10:11.745 --> 10:13.445
<i>the Flying Squirrel
takes longer</i>

10:13.447 --> 10:14.779
<i>than the athletes expect.</i>

10:14.781 --> 10:16.214
<i>- All right,
the pressure's on, Matt,</i>

10:16.216 --> 10:17.749
<i>and here's something
that's brand new.</i>

10:17.751 --> 10:19.951
<i>You can see the time
starts to click down</i>

10:19.953 --> 10:23.888
<i>right in front of your face.
That's added pressure.</i>

10:23.890 --> 10:25.991
<i>- Big grab!
- That's so intimidating.</i>

10:25.993 --> 10:28.259
<i>- He's got to get high
on this cargo net.</i>

10:28.261 --> 10:29.794
<i>- Don't look at that countdown.</i>

10:29.796 --> 10:31.596
<i>Matt, he's already starting
to get a little tired,</i>

10:31.598 --> 10:33.465
<i>- and he's low.
- And he's low!</i>

10:33.467 --> 10:35.166
<i>It's gonna be close.</i>

10:35.168 --> 10:37.202
<i>- Fight for your life.</i>

10:37.204 --> 10:39.738
<i>- 5 seconds left!</i>

10:39.740 --> 10:41.473
<i>Come on. Come on.
You can do it.</i>

10:41.475 --> 10:43.375
<i>- 1 second!
- You're so close!</i>

10:43.377 --> 10:46.011
No! No!

10:46.013 --> 10:48.880
- And on the runway,
time runs out

10:48.882 --> 10:53.785
<i>for the Eskimo Ninja just
steps away from the buzzer.</i>

10:53.787 --> 10:55.420
<i>- So close!</i>

10:55.422 --> 10:57.288
<i>- Good job, son!</i>

10:57.290 --> 10:59.257
<i>- He just couldn't
generate enough momentum</i>

10:59.259 --> 11:00.892
<i>on that last lache.</i>

11:00.894 --> 11:04.596
<i>Look how low he is on the net
with only 12 seconds left.</i>

11:04.598 --> 11:07.198
<i>If he could have swung higher
from those second handles,</i>

11:07.200 --> 11:08.733
<i>the Eskimo Ninja
might have been</i>

11:08.735 --> 11:10.368
<i>tonight's first finisher.</i>

11:10.370 --> 11:12.737
- Well, that tells us
how hard this stage is.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.707
He had 30 seconds
for the final obstacle

11:15.709 --> 11:17.942
and didn't have enough time.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.145
<i>He's standing by
with Kristine.</i>

11:20.147 --> 11:22.647
- Nick, you literally had
your hands on the platform

11:22.649 --> 11:23.882
as time ran out.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.350
How do you... how do you get
through that,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.819
and what are you
feeling right now?

11:27.821 --> 11:28.920
- I mean,
I was just gassed out,

11:28.922 --> 11:31.890
<i>but going up and being there</i>

11:31.892 --> 11:34.259
<i>and seeing the two
seconds climb down</i>

11:34.261 --> 11:36.995
<i>as I'm climbing up,
it's just, like, ahh,</i>

11:36.997 --> 11:38.997
<i>frustrating,
but I was there.</i>

11:38.999 --> 11:40.565
<i>I had it, so...</i>

11:40.567 --> 11:42.467
just get... if you fail,
keep working,

11:42.469 --> 11:43.535
keep working hard,
keep doing it.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.003
- Great message.
- Glad to hear it.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.038
- Thank you.
- Guys.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.909
<i>- Well, we are just
getting started.</i>

11:50.911 --> 11:52.243
- Whoo!

11:52.245 --> 11:54.512
<i>- It's night two
of the national finals.</i>

11:54.514 --> 11:56.648
<i>- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness!</i>

11:56.650 --> 11:59.851
<i>- Stage one has taken out
some of the sport's elite.</i>

11:59.853 --> 12:01.920
<i>- Superhero down!</i>

12:01.922 --> 12:04.522
<i>- Tonight, a new set
of stars face off</i>

12:04.524 --> 12:06.791
<i>with this brutal course.</i>

12:06.793 --> 12:09.427
<i>- Oh!
- Yes!</i>

12:09.429 --> 12:13.331
<i>- Plus, he scaled
all four stages last year.</i>

12:13.333 --> 12:18.036

12:18.038 --> 12:23.408
<i>Geoff Britten returns to Vegas

<i>ever to defeat
the Ultimate Cliffhanger.</i>

12:32.452 --> 12:34.953
<i>Brent Steffensen has done it!
Over the years,</i>

12:34.955 --> 12:38.623
<i>Las Vegas has brought out
the best in Brent Steffensen,</i>

12:38.625 --> 12:41.292
<i>and last year was no exception.</i>

12:41.294 --> 12:44.896
<i>And he has the fastest time
of the night.</i>

12:44.898 --> 12:45.964
- I love you guys!

12:47.100 --> 12:49.234

the 35-year-old gym owner</i>

12:49.236 --> 12:52.203
<i>is set for another
showdown here in Vegas,</i>

12:52.205 --> 12:55.373
<i>looking to return to his spot
as one of the greats.</i>

12:55.375 --> 12:58.109
<i>No one is more excited
to see Brent back in Vegas</i>

12:58.111 --> 12:59.677
<i>than Kacy Catanzaro.</i>

12:59.679 --> 13:01.546
- He's got this.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.381
<i>- But this year
their relationship status,</i>

13:03.383 --> 13:04.682
<i>well, it's complicated.</i>

13:06.520 --> 13:09.287
<i>- For the last three seasons
me and Kacy have been a couple.</i>

13:09.289 --> 13:11.256
- That was crazy!
- I did it.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.525
- What... what was that?

13:13.527 --> 13:16.494
Some have said
the... the royal couple of "ANW."

13:18.131 --> 13:20.131
<i>Our life has just been
totally intertwined</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:22.534
<i>in every way possible.</i>

13:22.536 --> 13:24.369
<i>We broke up, and it's been...</i>

13:24.371 --> 13:26.771
<i>it's been rough
to have it all torn away.</i>

13:28.842 --> 13:30.241
<i>We still have our friendship.</i>

13:30.243 --> 13:32.577
<i>We've stayed together
as far as training goes,</i>

13:32.579 --> 13:34.279
<i>and we also have
"Alpha Warrior" together,</i>

13:34.281 --> 13:36.514
<i>so we haven't lost everything.</i>

13:36.516 --> 13:38.082
- I'm really excited
that Brent and I

13:38.084 --> 13:39.484
are competing here together.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.352
You know, he's still
a great friend of mine,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.454
<i>and even though
we're not a couple anymore,</i>

13:43.456 --> 13:45.190
<i>I know that he's been
training really hard,</i>

13:45.192 --> 13:48.526
and I know that he really can
make a big mark this season.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.797
<i>- Last season I had
the fastest time on stage one.</i>

13:52.799 --> 13:54.532
<i>- Now this is
the old Brent Steffensen.</i>

13:54.534 --> 13:56.701
<i>- This looks like more
than a run for redemption.</i>

13:56.703 --> 13:58.203
<i>This looks like
the run for speed.</i>

13:58.205 --> 13:59.704
<i>- It felt amazing, you know,</i>

13:59.706 --> 14:02.240
'cause there's a lot of talent
coming up every season.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.142
<i>- Brent Steffensen,</i>

14:04.144 --> 14:06.878
<i>once again
the man here on stage one.</i>

14:06.880 --> 14:08.580
- I'm ready to do it again.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.317
- You got it, Brent!

14:12.319 --> 14:14.319
<i>- Well, we'll see Kacy
run later tonight,</i>

14:14.321 --> 14:16.654
<i>but Brent is ready to hit
this course now.</i>

14:16.656 --> 14:19.624
<i>- Well, it was season four in
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

14:19.626 --> 14:21.359
<i>that Steffensen made history,</i>

14:21.361 --> 14:24.295
<i>the first American to complete
the Ultimate Cliffhanger,</i>

14:24.297 --> 14:26.664
<i>but since then hasn't
reached those heights.</i>

14:26.666 --> 14:29.667
<i>And this season, Akbar,
he has yet to hit a buzzer.</i>

14:29.669 --> 14:31.636
<i>- Well, Matt,
I think that stage one,</i>

14:31.638 --> 14:33.137
<i>this is important for him.</i>

14:33.139 --> 14:34.472
<i>This is gonna really determine</i>

14:34.474 --> 14:36.407
<i>the... the psyche
of Brent Steffensen.</i>

14:36.409 --> 14:37.842
<i>He needs to have success here,</i>

14:37.844 --> 14:40.678
<i>and so far the first two
obstacles have been successful.</i>

14:40.680 --> 14:44.148
<i>Let's see if he can get past
this big Giant Log Grip.</i>

14:44.150 --> 14:46.985
<i>- Well, Brent's 35 now.
- He's been competing for...</i>

14:46.987 --> 14:48.753
<i>Oh, my!</i>

14:48.755 --> 14:51.522
<i>- That was a bad move.</i>

14:51.524 --> 14:53.658
<i>- This crowd is shocked.</i>

14:53.660 --> 14:57.061
<i>The fastest competitor
last year going home early.</i>

14:57.063 --> 14:58.696
- Sorry, Brent.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.599
<i>- As the log swung up,
Brent was parallel to it</i>

15:01.601 --> 15:03.635
<i>and had his back
to the landing pad,</i>

15:03.637 --> 15:06.537
<i>and look how he pushed off
thinking he had the landing,</i>

15:06.539 --> 15:09.240
<i>and yet another
high-profile ninja</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:11.309
<i>goes down
at the Giant Log Grip.</i>

15:11.311 --> 15:12.777
<i>- Well, just like last week,</i>

15:12.779 --> 15:15.680
<i>stage one is eating up
even the best ninjas.</i>

15:15.682 --> 15:17.548
<i>- You know what,
it's in their head, Matt.</i>

15:17.550 --> 15:19.417
<i>They are psyched out.</i>

15:19.419 --> 15:20.518
- Right now
let's go to Kristine,

15:20.520 --> 15:21.753
who's standing by Brent.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.421
- Brent, this is
a much earlier exit from you

15:23.423 --> 15:24.856
than I think
all of us expected.

15:24.858 --> 15:27.125
What do you think went wrong
for you in the Log Grip?

15:27.127 --> 15:29.861
- Well, I think I just
rushed it just a little bit.

15:29.863 --> 15:32.163
I should have given it
one more little beat,

15:32.165 --> 15:34.165
<i>but yeah, I've never
gone down on stage one,</i>

15:34.167 --> 15:36.734
<i>so it's a huge
disappointment.</i>

15:36.736 --> 15:39.070
- Where do you go
from here?

15:39.072 --> 15:42.607
- Well... I'm going
to hit the Strip.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.342
- I love to hear that.
- We're in Las Vegas.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.877
You might as well
take advantage of it.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.211
It's great to see
that you're having

15:47.213 --> 15:48.513
a good attitude
about all of it.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.048
- Thank you.
- No, it's always a fun...

15:50.050 --> 15:51.416
it's always a fun
time being here,

15:51.418 --> 15:52.884
and that's really what
it's all about, so...

15:52.886 --> 15:54.552
- Thank you.
- Guys, back to you.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.820
<i>- Thanks, Kristine.</i>

15:55.822 --> 15:58.523
<i>Well, if Brent competes
for another 20 years,</i>

15:58.525 --> 16:00.959
<i>he'll be as old
as our next competitor,</i>

16:00.961 --> 16:04.462
<i>the oldest athlete ever
to reach the national finals,</i>

16:04.464 --> 16:07.098
<i>54-year-old Jon Stewart.</i>

16:07.100 --> 16:09.634
<i>The construction manager
from Washington, Utah,</i>

16:09.636 --> 16:12.570
<i>was born in 1961.</i>

16:12.572 --> 16:15.540
<i>To put that in perspective,
54 years ago,</i>

16:15.542 --> 16:18.810
<i>the average
movie ticket cost 69¢,</i>

16:18.812 --> 16:21.145
<i>a gallon of gas cost 31¢,</i>

16:21.147 --> 16:22.580
<i>and a first-class stamp</i>

16:22.582 --> 16:26.417
<i>broke the piggy bank
at a whopping 4¢.</i>

16:26.419 --> 16:29.187
<i>Well, can Jon Stewart
put his stamp on stage one</i>

16:29.189 --> 16:30.455
<i>and be tonight's
first finisher?</i>

16:30.457 --> 16:31.622
<i>- All right! Whoo!</i>

16:31.624 --> 16:33.124
<i>- There you can see
Stewart's wife</i>

16:33.126 --> 16:36.794
<i>and all five of his kids,
ages 33 to 7.</i>

16:39.232 --> 16:40.898
<i>- Well, last year at Las Vegas</i>

16:40.900 --> 16:43.768
<i>he broke the record
for the oldest competitor</i>

16:43.770 --> 16:45.837
<i>previously held by him.</i>

16:45.839 --> 16:48.006
<i>His second appearance
on stage one.</i>

16:48.008 --> 16:49.841
<i>Never made it past
the third obstacle.</i>

16:49.843 --> 16:51.242
<i>- Well, this is
a great opportunity</i>

16:51.244 --> 16:52.543
<i>to get it going here.</i>

16:52.545 --> 16:55.947
<i>- Uh-oh.
- Ooh. No!</i>

16:55.949 --> 16:57.982
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>

16:57.984 --> 17:00.084
<i>- And just like that.</i>

17:00.086 --> 17:03.821
<i>Jon Stewart, always
so strong in the regionals</i>

17:03.823 --> 17:06.391
<i>but can't seem to figure it
out here in Vegas.</i>

17:06.393 --> 17:08.925
<i>- He hit a little too far
forward on the trampoline</i>

17:08.928 --> 17:11.896
<i>and just couldn't wrap his arms
around the propeller.</i>

17:11.897 --> 17:13.931
<i>And when he rushed his grab
for the rope,</i>

17:13.933 --> 17:15.733
<i>he just couldn't hold on.</i>

17:15.734 --> 17:17.367
<i>- Well, it's an ominous note</i>

17:17.369 --> 17:21.005
<i>as the first four competitors
can't finish the course.</i>

17:21.007 --> 17:25.076
- Dang. Really wanted it.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.377
<i>- Well, look who's
getting loose.</i>

17:27.380 --> 17:29.547
<i>The first man to reach
the top of the tower</i>

17:29.549 --> 17:32.016
<i>is getting ready
for another run.</i>

17:32.018 --> 17:34.519
<i>Plus, he was the only athlete</i>

17:34.521 --> 17:36.888
<i>to conquer the course
in Los Angeles.</i>

17:36.890 --> 17:39.157
<i>Josh Levin has done it!</i>

17:39.159 --> 17:41.259
<i>Now the youngest competitor
of the night</i>

17:41.261 --> 17:44.062
<i>wants to see
just how far he can go...</i>

17:44.064 --> 17:45.563
- Yeah!

17:45.565 --> 17:46.764
I can't believe I'm here.

17:46.766 --> 17:50.101
<i>- When "American
Ninja Warrior" returns.</i>

17:52.137 --> 17:53.638
<i>- Welcome back to night two</i>

17:53.640 --> 17:55.940
<i>of the national finals
in Las Vegas.</i>

17:55.942 --> 17:59.610
<i>While we were away, three more
ninjas took on stage one.</i>

17:59.612 --> 18:01.846
<i>Yuri Force
is one of the 30 rookies</i>

18:01.848 --> 18:03.848
<i>who qualified for Vegas...</i>

18:03.850 --> 18:05.516
<i>Smooth flight there.</i>

18:05.518 --> 18:07.485
<i>But the Atlanta
air traffic controller</i>

18:07.487 --> 18:09.487
<i>had a rough landing
at the Propeller Bar.</i>

18:09.489 --> 18:12.090
<i>- Oh!
- Oh!</i>

18:12.092 --> 18:14.125
<i>The Ninja Scout,
Jackson Meyer,</i>

18:14.127 --> 18:17.128
<i>ditched his uniform
and busted a move...</i>

18:17.130 --> 18:18.229
<i>Look at those moves.</i>

18:18.231 --> 18:19.964
- Go, Jackson!

18:19.966 --> 18:23.101
<i>- But the Eagle Scout
wasn't prepared for Snake Run.</i>

18:23.103 --> 18:24.902
<i>No!</i>

18:24.904 --> 18:26.471
- I told myself
I wouldn't do that.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.706
<i>- Another rookie,
Utah's Clayton Wolf,</i>

18:28.708 --> 18:30.374
<i>came out howling...</i>

18:30.376 --> 18:31.709
<i>- The Wolf is loose.</i>

18:31.711 --> 18:33.377
<i>- But at the Giant Log Grip,</i>

18:33.379 --> 18:36.047
<i>the real estate investor
was underwater.</i>

18:36.049 --> 18:39.484
<i>A promising run cut short
as the Wolf gets wet.</i>

18:39.486 --> 18:41.652
- I was cruising fast.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.754
<i>- On the course right now,</i>

18:43.756 --> 18:46.090
<i>standing 6'6" tall,</i>

18:46.092 --> 18:49.460
<i>it's 27-year-old
carpenter Jon Alexis Jr.</i>

18:49.462 --> 18:53.464
<i>The man known as "The Giant"
now at the Giant Log Grip.</i>

18:53.466 --> 18:55.032
<i>- Here we go, Matt.</i>

18:55.034 --> 18:58.069
<i>Fee-fi-fo, look at Alexis go!</i>

19:00.807 --> 19:02.273
<i>- And he's through.</i>

19:02.275 --> 19:05.343
<i>Jesse "Flex" Labreck
cheering with Jon's parents.</i>

19:05.345 --> 19:07.645
<i>This is where she went out
last week.</i>

19:07.647 --> 19:08.646
<i>- Ooh!
- Hold it!</i>

19:08.648 --> 19:10.348
<i>- Hold it!
- And The Giant...</i>

19:10.350 --> 19:11.782
<i>- This is a disadvantage!</i>

19:11.784 --> 19:13.518
<i>He is scrunched up in there.</i>

19:13.520 --> 19:15.019
<i>- Look at that.
- Look at him.</i>

19:15.021 --> 19:17.522
<i>- He's so big, so tall.
- And look at that.</i>

19:17.524 --> 19:20.758
<i>Jon Alexis, though,
is destroying this course.</i>

19:20.760 --> 19:22.760
<i>- Matt, he told me
he'd crush stage one.</i>

19:22.762 --> 19:25.830
I know exactly what you told
me you were gonna do, Jon.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.298
<i>- Right through
the Sonic Curve.</i>

19:27.300 --> 19:30.034
<i>Loping through it
under control.</i>

19:30.036 --> 19:31.702
<i>Moving on to the Warped Wall.</i>

19:33.139 --> 19:35.439
<i>- Use those long limbs,
Giant.</i>

19:35.441 --> 19:37.909
<i>- Well, The Giant
is making stage one</i>

19:37.911 --> 19:39.544
<i>his playground right now.</i>

19:39.546 --> 19:41.012
<i>- Look at this.
- He has been smooth, Matt.</i>

19:41.014 --> 19:43.681
- No problem.
- No problem.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.551
<i>- Well, we saw
so much potential last year,</i>

19:46.553 --> 19:48.286
<i>and he is putting it together,</i>

19:48.288 --> 19:51.155
<i>but this course taking its toll
on the big man.</i>

19:51.157 --> 19:53.925
<i>- He looks gassed.</i>
- Piece of cake! Piece of cake!

19:53.927 --> 19:55.159
<i>- He's got to be careful.</i>

19:55.161 --> 19:57.328
<i>This Broken Bridge,
it really is broken.</i>

19:57.330 --> 19:58.563
<i>Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.</i>

19:58.565 --> 19:59.864
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh.</i>

19:59.866 --> 20:01.065
<i>- A hard impact!</i>

20:03.403 --> 20:05.203
<i>Plenty of time
for the last obstacle,</i>

20:05.205 --> 20:07.238
<i>but The Giant looks dazed.</i>

20:07.240 --> 20:10.808
<i>- That hit to the platform
knocked the wind out of him,</i>

20:10.810 --> 20:12.610
<i>but he's got time.</i>

20:12.612 --> 20:15.313
<i>- We could be looking
at tonight's first finisher.</i>

20:15.315 --> 20:18.049
<i>- He barely even had
to jump off there.</i>

20:18.051 --> 20:19.417
<i>- Come on. Come on.
- He's focused.</i>

20:19.419 --> 20:21.385
<i>You know, I bet you he could
just reach out</i>

20:21.387 --> 20:22.386
<i>and touch that net...</i>

20:22.388 --> 20:23.921
<i>- No!
- Oh!</i>

20:23.923 --> 20:25.590
- Oh!

20:25.592 --> 20:27.091
Dang!

20:27.093 --> 20:28.726
<i>- And just like that,</i>

20:28.728 --> 20:32.563
<i>The Giant cut down to size
by the final obstacle.</i>

20:32.565 --> 20:34.498
<i>- The buzzer was in his sights,</i>

20:34.500 --> 20:36.601
<i>but when he made
that transition,</i>

20:36.603 --> 20:38.536
<i>his right hand grabs
one handle,</i>

20:38.538 --> 20:41.172
<i>but he hits the left handle
with his wrist.</i>

20:41.174 --> 20:44.175
<i>That crucial error
left The Giant all wet.</i>

20:44.177 --> 20:46.911
- Well, after 38 finishers
last year,

20:46.913 --> 20:50.147
this course is fighting back
and fighting back hard.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.850
<i>Last week on stage one,
only eight finishers.</i>

20:52.852 --> 20:55.853
<i>So far tonight, zero.</i>

20:55.855 --> 20:57.755
<i>But our next competitor
hopes to change that.</i>

20:57.757 --> 20:59.457
<i>This is Josh Levin.</i>

20:59.459 --> 21:01.459
<i>The 22-year-old
engineering student</i>

21:01.461 --> 21:04.528
<i>was the only athlete
to finish the L.A. city finals.</i>

21:04.530 --> 21:06.063
<i>This contender
for the rookie of the year</i>

21:06.065 --> 21:09.400
<i>is shooting for the stars
on the course and off.</i>

21:11.904 --> 21:14.505
<i>- Last year I had
the really unique opportunity</i>

21:14.507 --> 21:16.574
<i>to have a six-month internship</i>

21:16.576 --> 21:18.576
<i>at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory</i>

21:18.578 --> 21:20.211
<i>in Pasadena, California.</i>

21:20.213 --> 21:23.914
That experience was
absolutely out of this world.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.686
<i>I got to work on a mission</i>

21:28.688 --> 21:31.188
<i>that will be going
to Mars in four years.</i>

21:31.190 --> 21:33.758
That's, like, every little
kid's dream come true.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.726
Blast off.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.634
<i>- Oh!</i>

21:43.636 --> 21:45.469
<i>- Engineering
and "Ninja Warrior"</i>

21:45.471 --> 21:46.904
have very,
very similar attributes

21:46.906 --> 21:48.706
<i>because it's all about
problem solving</i>

21:48.708 --> 21:51.075
<i>to overcome big goals.</i>

21:51.077 --> 21:52.610
Yeah!

21:52.612 --> 21:54.645
<i>- Josh Levin has done it!</i>

21:54.647 --> 21:56.714
- Whoo!

21:56.716 --> 21:58.482
<i>The sky is not the limit.</i>

21:58.484 --> 22:02.253
If we dream big and work hard,
anything's possible.

22:02.255 --> 22:04.155
Whoo!

22:04.157 --> 22:06.424
<i>- Well, Josh's parents
and his best friend</i>

22:06.426 --> 22:08.592
<i>are here representing
for Team Josh</i>

22:08.594 --> 22:10.161
<i>as well as a big group
of friends</i>

22:10.163 --> 22:12.797
<i>who made the trip
from California.</i>

22:15.435 --> 22:18.402
<i>Josh, 5'6"
and a solid 150 pounds.</i>

22:18.404 --> 22:20.771
<i>He's a speed climber,
champion speed climber,</i>

22:20.773 --> 22:22.807
<i>one of the most
decorated in America.</i>

22:22.809 --> 22:26.177
<i>Actually a 19-time
national championship.</i>

22:26.179 --> 22:27.712
<i>- This is his game,</i>

22:27.714 --> 22:30.414
<i>and it's good that Josh Levin
likes to go fast.</i>

22:30.416 --> 22:33.718
<i>He only has 2 minutes and
20 seconds to hit that buzzer.</i>

22:33.720 --> 22:36.754
<i>- The rookie now taking
on the Giant Log Grip.</i>

22:36.756 --> 22:39.223
<i>- Levin's got grip strength
for days.</i>

22:39.225 --> 22:41.659
<i>Now he just better brace
for those three drops.</i>

22:42.895 --> 22:44.762
<i>- Levin
keeping a viselike grip.</i>

22:44.764 --> 22:46.097
<i>- That's a smart move.</i>

22:46.099 --> 22:48.032
<i>Now he can ease down
over the pad.</i>

22:48.034 --> 22:49.667
<i>- So smooth.</i>

22:49.669 --> 22:51.936
<i>The engineering student
through the third obstacle.</i>

22:51.938 --> 22:54.038
- Come on!
- Get that Spider.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.741
<i>- Well, this is a guy who has
competed at a very high level</i>

22:56.743 --> 22:58.342
<i>for almost his entire life.</i>

22:58.344 --> 23:00.511
<i>Got into climbing so early.</i>

23:00.513 --> 23:02.246
<i>And locks in on
the Jumping Spider.</i>

23:02.248 --> 23:05.015
<i>- And look at that rapid speed
that he's moving with, Matt.</i>

23:05.017 --> 23:07.218
<i>Look. He is just
so fluid there.</i>

23:07.220 --> 23:08.686
<i>Look at that.</i>

23:08.688 --> 23:10.788
<i>- The 22-year-old rookie</i>

23:10.790 --> 23:12.790
<i>looking like
a seasoned veteran.</i>

23:12.792 --> 23:15.693
<i>Gravity does not apply
to this man.</i>

23:15.695 --> 23:17.428
<i>- Well, don't let gravity
do you in</i>

23:17.430 --> 23:18.996
<i>here at Sonic Curve.</i>

23:18.998 --> 23:21.065
<i>- A measured approach.
- That's okay.</i>

23:21.067 --> 23:22.666
<i>- He was the only person</i>

23:22.668 --> 23:25.403
<i>to finish ahead of Jessie Graff
in the L.A. finals.</i>

23:25.405 --> 23:28.105
<i>Can he join her on stage two?</i>

23:28.107 --> 23:31.509
<i>- Ooh, he got tripped up there
but saved it right there.</i>

23:31.511 --> 23:32.877
<i>- Climber's grip strength.</i>

23:32.879 --> 23:34.078
- Yeah, Josh!

23:34.080 --> 23:36.013
<i>- He saved
some major time there.</i>

23:36.015 --> 23:39.250
<i>- He's got about 55 seconds
for the last two obstacles.</i>

23:39.252 --> 23:40.718
<i>- Well, he said he's capable</i>

23:40.720 --> 23:42.620
<i>of getting
through stages two and three.</i>

23:42.622 --> 23:45.022
<i>- Just had to survive... oh!
- Wow!</i>

23:45.024 --> 23:49.293
<i>The Broken Bridge nearly breaks
the run of this rookie,</i>

23:49.295 --> 23:51.295
<i>- but he survives.
- And let me tell you.</i>

23:51.297 --> 23:53.531
<i>They don't have
trampolines in rock climbing.</i>

23:53.533 --> 23:55.332
<i>One mistake
on the Flying Squirrel</i>

23:55.334 --> 23:57.635
<i>is all it takes
to end this run.</i>

23:57.637 --> 23:59.703
<i>- Well, this crowd
getting excited.</i>

23:59.705 --> 24:01.605
<i>They want to see a finisher.</i>

24:01.607 --> 24:03.040
<i>About a half minute left.</i>

24:03.042 --> 24:05.042
<i>- Well, Matt, what happens
in Vegas stays in Vegas,</i>

24:05.044 --> 24:06.377
<i>but this won't stay in Vegas</i>

24:06.379 --> 24:09.213
<i>because the revolution
will be televised.</i>

24:09.215 --> 24:11.682
<i>Look what he's doing right now.</i>

24:11.684 --> 24:14.985
<i>- This rookie who wowed
the crowd in Los Angeles</i>

24:14.987 --> 24:17.455
<i>as the only finisher
now has the chance</i>

24:17.457 --> 24:19.790
<i>to be our first finisher
of the night.</i>

24:19.792 --> 24:21.625
<i>- Yeah, the count
buzzer here, Matt.</i>

24:21.627 --> 24:23.828
<i>This is his third buzzer.</i>

24:23.830 --> 24:26.664
<i>A rookie with three buzzers?
Get it!</i>

24:26.666 --> 24:29.967
- Yeah! Whoo!

24:29.969 --> 24:34.038
<i>- And what a run
out of this rookie.</i>

24:34.040 --> 24:38.209
<i>Josh Levin becomes our first
finisher tonight on stage one.</i>

24:38.211 --> 24:39.910
<i>You are looking at someone</i>

24:39.912 --> 24:43.447
<i>who's going to continue to be
a star for years to come.</i>

24:43.449 --> 24:47.017
<i>- Look at the one-handed grab
on the Warped Wall</i>

24:47.019 --> 24:48.686
<i>with just his fingertips.</i>

24:48.688 --> 24:51.856
<i>And at the Broken Bridge,
the former NASA intern</i>

24:51.858 --> 24:53.691
<i>crashed down to Earth</i>

24:53.693 --> 24:56.260
<i>when his right leg
missed that fifth step.</i>

24:56.262 --> 24:58.128
<i>Ooh! He'll feel that one
tomorrow.</i>

24:58.130 --> 25:00.331
<i>But Josh Levin
blocked out the pain,</i>

25:00.333 --> 25:02.266
<i>and the rookie remains perfect.</i>

25:02.268 --> 25:03.734
- Yeah!

25:03.736 --> 25:05.903
<i>- And right now he's
standing by with Kristine.</i>

25:05.905 --> 25:08.172
- Josh, congratulations.
- Your rookie season.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.307
Did you ever think
that this was possible?

25:10.309 --> 25:12.910
- No. I... I would
never have even imagined

25:12.912 --> 25:14.044
that this would
actually happen.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.880
I mean, even getting
the callback this year

25:15.882 --> 25:17.047
was a dream come true.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.616
Making it through
all the way to city finals

25:18.618 --> 25:20.951
and now here stage one
Mount Midoriyama.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.953
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

25:22.955 --> 25:25.055
- Back to you,
Matt and Akbar.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.657
<i>- Thanks, Kristine.</i>

25:26.659 --> 25:30.060
<i>Some of our best are coming up
including Jake Murray,</i>

25:30.062 --> 25:31.829
<i>and to see Jake's journey
to Vegas,</i>

25:31.831 --> 25:34.532
<i>check out our digital series</i>

25:34.534 --> 25:38.736
<i>available
on the NBC app and at NBC.com.</i>

25:38.738 --> 25:40.437
<i>Plus, Mack Roesch is ready</i>

25:40.439 --> 25:42.940
<i>to muscle his way
through stage one...</i>

25:42.942 --> 25:46.377
- Yeah!
- I'm coming for the ninja crown.

25:46.379 --> 25:50.114
<i>- When "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

25:52.417 --> 25:53.918
<i>- Welcome back
to the national finals</i>

25:53.920 --> 25:56.153
<i>of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

25:56.155 --> 25:57.988
<i>This season our friends
at POM Wonderful</i>

25:57.990 --> 26:00.791
<i>are offering
a special bonus for the fans.</i>

26:00.793 --> 26:03.594
<i>Go to NBC.com/POM to enter</i>

26:03.596 --> 26:06.797
<i>the "Train Like a Crazy
Healthy Ninja" sweepstakes</i>

26:06.799 --> 26:10.234
<i>where you could win
$10,000 and a trip to L.A.</i>

26:10.236 --> 26:13.103
<i>to work out with
"American Ninja Warrior" champ</i>

26:13.105 --> 26:15.472
<i>Isaac Caldiero.</i>

26:15.474 --> 26:17.675
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes</i>

26:17.677 --> 26:20.978
<i>tried their hand at this brutal
stage one course.</i>

26:20.980 --> 26:23.814
<i>Tiana Webberley, who trains
with Flip Rodriguez...</i>

26:23.816 --> 26:25.182
- Let's go team!

26:25.184 --> 26:26.717
<i>- Bounded through Snake Run...</i>

26:26.719 --> 26:29.019
<i>- This girl ain't playing.
- Straight up.</i>

26:29.021 --> 26:30.487
<i>- But the 24-year-old waitress</i>

26:30.489 --> 26:32.890
<i>got served by
the Propeller Bar.</i>

26:32.892 --> 26:36.527
<i>Sweet D doused
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

26:36.529 --> 26:38.596
<i>Grant Clinton suffered a stroke</i>

26:38.598 --> 26:40.764
<i>and almost died
seven months ago,</i>

26:40.766 --> 26:43.267
<i>yet he miraculously finished
the finals course</i>

26:43.269 --> 26:45.269
<i>in Oklahoma City...</i>

26:45.271 --> 26:47.037
<i>Unreal!</i>

26:47.039 --> 26:48.372
<i>But tonight in Vegas,</i>

26:48.374 --> 26:51.408
<i>his miracle season ended
after just a few steps.</i>

26:51.410 --> 26:53.444
<i>- Oh!
- That is not the way</i>

26:53.446 --> 26:55.813
<i>the script
was supposed to be written.</i>

26:55.815 --> 26:57.715
<i>- In his seventh season
competing,</i>

26:57.717 --> 26:59.149
<i>Georgia's Brett Sims</i>

26:59.151 --> 27:01.452
<i>finally got his
first shot at Vegas...</i>

27:01.454 --> 27:03.654
<i>- Nailed it!</i>
- Yes!

27:03.656 --> 27:06.624
<i>- But after multiple attempts
at the Warped Wall...</i>

27:06.626 --> 27:09.393
<i>- Come on, Brett. You're gonna
need a Hail Mary here.</i>

27:09.395 --> 27:12.696
- One more time! Come on!
<i>- He ran out of time.</i>

27:12.698 --> 27:15.165
<i>Comes up short again.</i>

27:16.669 --> 27:18.936
<i>And at the starting block
right now...</i>

27:18.938 --> 27:20.437
- Yeah!

27:20.439 --> 27:23.540
<i>- Getting himself fired up,
rookie Jessell Boseman</i>

27:23.542 --> 27:25.075
<i>out of Conroe, Texas.</i>

27:25.077 --> 27:28.312
<i>In Oklahoma City, Boseman
showed tremendous agility.</i>

27:28.314 --> 27:30.214
<i>- That's the agility you
you talking about, Matt.</i>

27:30.216 --> 27:32.449
<i>- And right into
the Propeller Bar</i>

27:32.451 --> 27:34.752
<i>- but misses that rope.
- Ah, no, no.</i>

27:34.754 --> 27:36.353
<i>Use your legs, there.
Get it. Kick it.</i>

27:36.355 --> 27:38.555
<i>- Now just a passenger
floating around.</i>

27:38.557 --> 27:40.424
<i>Gotta get this dismount...</i>

27:40.426 --> 27:41.592
<i>And he's through.</i>

27:41.594 --> 27:42.860
<i>Well, his mom and sister</i>

27:42.862 --> 27:45.062
<i>made the trip from Texas
to cheer him on.</i>

27:45.064 --> 27:46.330
<i>6'2", 177.</i>

27:46.332 --> 27:48.432
<i>Boseman using that
long frame now.</i>

27:48.434 --> 27:50.768
<i>- Well, Matt, the Giant Log
Grip, though, is so low...</i>

27:50.770 --> 27:53.804
<i>nearly three times the length
of the one we saw in Philly.</i>

27:53.806 --> 27:55.572
<i>You have to great timing here
on the pad.</i>

27:55.574 --> 27:56.940
<i>- And he nails... oh!</i>

27:56.942 --> 27:58.942
<i>Almost a stumble there,</i>

27:58.944 --> 28:02.046
<i>and the tumbling coach
tumbling to the platform.</i>

28:02.048 --> 28:03.313
<i>- Matt, it's the first time</i>

28:03.315 --> 28:05.282
<i>he's ever seen
the Jumping Spider.</i>

28:05.284 --> 28:07.685
<i>You have to be
precise here with this.</i>

28:07.687 --> 28:09.286
<i>- One foot off the tramp...
- Whoa!</i>

28:09.288 --> 28:11.722
<i>- And locked in...
- Okay, rookie! Okay, rookie!</i>

28:11.724 --> 28:13.123
<i>- But it looks like
he's having trouble</i>

28:13.125 --> 28:14.491
<i>really getting purchase
with those feet.</i>

28:14.493 --> 28:16.060
<i>- That's because he's 6'2",
Matt.</i>

28:16.062 --> 28:18.462
<i>Doesn't have the flexibility
in his hips or his knees.</i>

28:18.464 --> 28:20.597
<i>You see it looks
real uncomfortable for him.</i>

28:20.599 --> 28:22.533
<i>You better get out
of that Jumping Spider.</i>

28:22.535 --> 28:23.934
<i>- Well, just over
1 minute 20 left.</i>

28:23.936 --> 28:25.936
<i>This rookie put together
a promising run.</i>

28:25.938 --> 28:27.705
<i>The long drop down,</i>

28:27.707 --> 28:29.740
<i>and the Sonic Curve
should play to his strengths.</i>

28:29.742 --> 28:30.908
<i>- Okay, Jessell.</i>

28:30.910 --> 28:32.409
<i>- He's looking winded,
though, Akbar.</i>

28:32.411 --> 28:33.610
<i>- Uh-oh, the Sonic Curve.</i>

28:33.612 --> 28:36.413
<i>Get the sonic boom
for your Bose headset.</i>

28:36.415 --> 28:38.582
<i>Oh!</i>

28:38.584 --> 28:39.883
<i>- Boseman now hung up.
- Ooh!</i>

28:39.885 --> 28:41.318
<i>- He can push off that pillar.</i>

28:41.320 --> 28:42.820
<i>- Come on, Boseman.
- Use that that 6'2"</i>

28:42.822 --> 28:44.855
<i>- And the clock is ticking.
- He's looking winded.</i>

28:44.857 --> 28:48.025
<i>Does he have enough left
for the final three obstacles?</i>

28:49.762 --> 28:51.495
<i>And right up the Warped Wall.</i>

28:53.499 --> 28:56.033
<i>- Plenty enough time here.
- Matt, now he's got to</i>

28:56.035 --> 28:59.903
<i>get to this new obstacle here
in the Broken Bridge.</i>

28:59.905 --> 29:01.939
<i>- The Broken Bridge
an agility test.</i>

29:01.941 --> 29:04.942
<i>At 6'2", not gonna need
to overstride here.</i>

29:04.944 --> 29:06.376
<i>- 6'2".
- Ooh, working them quick feet.</i>

29:06.378 --> 29:08.245
<i>- And he rolls!
- Look at this!</i>

29:08.247 --> 29:11.949
<i>A rookie one obstacle away
from stage two!</i>

29:11.951 --> 29:15.586
<i>- He got here only 3 seconds
faster than Nick Hanson did,</i>

29:15.588 --> 29:18.889
<i>so he's gotta get trucking.
The clock is ticking.</i>

29:18.891 --> 29:20.657
<i>- This is a 10-foot lache</i>

29:20.659 --> 29:23.127
<i>from the first handles
to the second.</i>

29:23.129 --> 29:25.262
<i>- Come on, just... oh!
- Oh!</i>

29:27.166 --> 29:28.365
<i>- A promising run,</i>

29:28.367 --> 29:32.236
<i>but he falls
on the final obstacle.</i>

29:32.238 --> 29:34.505
<i>- First take another look
at the one-foot leap</i>

29:34.507 --> 29:36.273
<i>into the Jumping Spider.</i>

29:36.275 --> 29:37.708
<i>I've never seen that.</i>

29:37.710 --> 29:39.276
<i>But on the Flying Squirrel</i>

29:39.278 --> 29:40.711
<i>he didn't build enough momentum</i>

29:40.713 --> 29:43.547
<i>to make that leap
and did a belly flop.</i>

29:44.950 --> 29:46.717
- I think I just rushed it.

29:46.719 --> 29:50.220
Thought I was fast enough.
I just cut it too short.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.489
Maybe next year.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.658
<i>- Well, next up
is another rookie,</i>

29:54.660 --> 29:57.227
<i>the self-proclaimed
"King of Obstacles,"</i>

29:57.229 --> 30:00.798
<i>220 pound construction
worker Mack Roesch.</i>

30:00.800 --> 30:02.432
<i>The King blew us away
in Atlanta,</i>

30:02.434 --> 30:05.002
<i>muscling his way through
a grueling course.</i>

30:05.004 --> 30:07.337
<i>- Well,
that's a real crown, Matt.</i>

30:07.339 --> 30:10.874
<i>- And kept his crown on
from start to finish.</i>

30:10.876 --> 30:13.811
- Yeah!

30:13.813 --> 30:17.214
<i>- Well, after the Atlanta
competition, we promised Mack</i>

30:17.216 --> 30:20.117
that if he finished stage one,
we'd put on crowns.

30:20.119 --> 30:23.353
- All right, King. Come on.
- Bring it on, Mack Roesch.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.088
<i>- And the robe comes off.</i>

30:25.090 --> 30:28.091
<i>Mack ready to take on
stage one.</i>

30:28.093 --> 30:31.728
<i>There's his father McDuff
here to cheer him on.</i>

30:33.199 --> 30:35.666
<i>- Clearly, Mack is a physical
marvel for a guy his size.</i>

30:35.668 --> 30:39.102
<i>He runs a 40-yard dash
in 4.5 seconds.</i>

30:39.104 --> 30:41.405
<i>- And look at him go.</i>

30:41.407 --> 30:43.340
<i>- He is living
up to his last name,</i>

30:43.342 --> 30:45.475
<i>and he is rushing
through this course.</i>

30:45.477 --> 30:47.644
<i>- Mack Roesch,
a great rush thus far.</i>

30:47.646 --> 30:49.813
<i>A little misstep
here on the Propeller Bar,</i>

30:49.815 --> 30:51.648
<i>but what agility.</i>

30:51.650 --> 30:53.517
<i>Mack calls himself
the "King of Obstacles,"</i>

30:53.519 --> 30:55.986
<i>and he's even put out
business cards and T-shirts.</i>

30:55.988 --> 30:58.689
<i>- Well, the King better hold
on here on the Giant Log Grip.</i>

30:58.691 --> 31:00.424
<i>- Hold on.
- The bigger question is,</i>

31:00.426 --> 31:03.827
<i>is the Giant Log Grip
ready for Mack?</i>

31:03.829 --> 31:05.195
<i>- The King is here!</i>

31:05.197 --> 31:07.631
<i>The King is here.</i>

31:07.633 --> 31:09.633
<i>Now this is where you see
the big bulk here.</i>

31:09.635 --> 31:11.034
<i>- Right into it!
- Does he have the flexibility?</i>

31:11.036 --> 31:12.970
- Oh!
- No!

31:12.972 --> 31:15.305
- Body slammed!

31:15.307 --> 31:17.174
<i>- The King knocked off
his throne,</i>

31:17.176 --> 31:19.042
<i>but the crown stays on,</i>

31:19.044 --> 31:21.778
<i>and still only
one finisher tonight.</i>

31:21.780 --> 31:25.249
<i>- Look again at how the big
fella tore through Snake Run.</i>

31:25.251 --> 31:26.850
<i>But at the Jumping Spider,</i>

31:26.852 --> 31:30.120
<i>his left foot slipped
as soon as he enters the chute,</i>

31:30.122 --> 31:33.557
<i>and 220 pounds is too much
to hold up with just your arms.</i>

31:33.559 --> 31:37.361
<i>- Well, I guess we'll have to
save the crown for next year.</i>

31:37.363 --> 31:38.795
<i>- Coming up...</i>

31:38.797 --> 31:42.599
<i>Last year, Drew Drechsel
finally reached stage three...</i>

31:42.601 --> 31:45.002
- Yeah, baby!
- Stage three!

31:45.004 --> 31:48.071
<i>- But now he's ready to take it
to the next level...</i>

31:48.073 --> 31:49.172
- I definitely feel like I have

31:49.174 --> 31:51.341
unfinished business here
in Las Vegas.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.342
<i>- And later...</i>

31:52.344 --> 31:53.677
<i>He did it!</i>

31:53.679 --> 31:56.647
<i>He went where no man
had ever gone before.</i>

31:56.649 --> 31:58.849
- Stage four. Whoo!

31:58.851 --> 32:00.851
<i>- Can the first
American Ninja Warrior</i>

32:00.853 --> 32:02.853
<i>make it back to the top?</i>

32:02.855 --> 32:05.222
- If I decide to do something,
there is no stopping me.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.590
Yeah!

32:06.592 --> 32:09.559
<i>- Find out when "American
Ninja Warrior" returns.</i>

<i>of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

32:15.701 --> 32:17.768

32:26.478 --> 32:28.512
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes</i>

32:28.514 --> 32:31.949
<i>tried to conquer
this unforgiving stage one.</i>

32:31.951 --> 32:34.618
<i>New Jersey track coach
Anthony DeFranco</i>

32:34.620 --> 32:36.620
<i>sprinted onto the course...</i>

32:36.622 --> 32:38.555
<i>- He came off the block
smoking.</i>

32:38.557 --> 32:39.890
<i>- But like many other
first-timers,</i>

32:39.892 --> 32:42.326
<i>his season ended
at the Jumping Spider.</i>

32:42.328 --> 32:45.629
<i>- Oh!
- Bounced off like a pinball.</i>

32:45.631 --> 32:48.231
<i>- Photographer Andrew Lowes
was picture perfect</i>

32:48.233 --> 32:50.067
<i>on the Jumping Spider...</i>

32:50.069 --> 32:53.236
<i>Andrew Lowes
making good time here.</i>

32:53.238 --> 32:57.107
<i>But the four-time Vegas veteran
lost his focus at Sonic Curve.</i>

32:57.109 --> 33:00.978
<i>And a promising run
comes to an end.</i>

33:00.980 --> 33:03.580
<i>Colorado insurance agent
Brittany Reid came in</i>

33:03.582 --> 33:05.349
<i>as the tallest
female competitor...</i>

33:05.351 --> 33:09.152
<i>Brittany Reid showed
a lot of promise in Atlanta.</i>

33:09.154 --> 33:12.656
<i>But even at 5'9", she came up
short at the Propeller Bar.</i>

33:12.658 --> 33:15.759
<i>- Oh, not enough return there.
- No!</i>

33:15.761 --> 33:17.260
<i>- Well,
our next female athlete</i>

33:17.262 --> 33:19.696
<i>is 6 inches shorter
than Brittany,</i>

33:19.698 --> 33:22.799
<i>but she's ready to flex
her muscle on stage one.</i>

33:22.801 --> 33:25.202
<i>It's 24-year-old
Natalie Duran.</i>

33:25.204 --> 33:28.839
<i>UCLA researcher is also
a YouTube sensation</i>

33:28.841 --> 33:31.008
<i>with 100,000 followers.</i>

33:31.010 --> 33:34.611
<i>But there are two people whose
attention she really wants.</i>

33:34.613 --> 33:36.713
<i>- I'm a first-generation
Asian-American,</i>

33:36.715 --> 33:38.148
<i>and since I was born,</i>

33:38.150 --> 33:40.584
<i>my parents were expecting me
to become a doctor...</i>

33:40.586 --> 33:42.219
<i>Ooh!</i>

33:42.221 --> 33:44.921
<i>What's up, YouTube?</i>

33:44.923 --> 33:46.456
<i>But I am just, like,</i>

33:46.458 --> 33:49.459
camera all the time,
loud all the time...

33:49.461 --> 33:51.762
<i>Hoo-ah! Ow.</i>

33:51.764 --> 33:53.864
And I... I really like
attention.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.365
Whoo!

33:55.367 --> 33:57.200
<i>So I wouldn't call myself
the black sheep of the family.</i>

33:57.202 --> 34:00.103
I'm more of the rainbow
sheep of the family.

34:00.105 --> 34:02.572
<i>- What power out of Duran.
- This will actually be</i>

34:02.574 --> 34:04.007
<i>the first time
my parents come</i>

34:04.009 --> 34:05.909
<i>and watch me run the course.</i>

34:05.911 --> 34:07.677
<i>- She's got it!</i>

34:07.679 --> 34:09.246
<i>- My parents being proud of me
in something</i>

34:09.248 --> 34:12.649
that's not purely academic
is the world to me.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.219
<i>- And Mom and Dad are ready.</i>

34:17.222 --> 34:20.290
<i>First time ever watching
their daughter compete.</i>

34:20.292 --> 34:22.225
<i>Well, she impressed us
in Los Angeles,</i>

34:22.226 --> 34:25.429
<i>qualifying for the city
finals along with Jessie Graff.</i>

34:25.431 --> 34:27.764
<i>Hoping now to join
Jessie on stage two.</i>

34:31.370 --> 34:33.469
<i>At 5'3", gets through
the Snake Run,</i>

34:33.472 --> 34:36.005
<i>but the Propeller Bar always
a challenge for the women,</i>

34:36.007 --> 34:37.706
<i>particularly the smaller
and lighter ones.</i>

34:37.708 --> 34:40.310
<i>- Oh, you have to own it.
- So what it's been difficult?</i>

34:40.312 --> 34:42.279
<i>- Oh, no!</i>

34:42.281 --> 34:44.880
- Oh, my God.

34:44.882 --> 34:47.884
<i>- And Natalie Duran
becomes the 16th victim</i>

34:47.886 --> 34:50.687
<i>of the Propeller Bar
here on stage one.</i>

34:50.688 --> 34:53.156
- It's okay.
- It's okay, it's okay.

34:53.158 --> 34:54.858
<i>- Well, let's check out
her technique again</i>

34:54.860 --> 34:56.092
<i>on the trampoline.</i>

34:56.094 --> 34:58.428
<i>She leans too far forward
on the launch</i>

34:58.430 --> 35:00.263
<i>and goes out and not up.</i>

35:00.265 --> 35:04.234
<i>At 5'3", she needed a lot
more elevation than she got.</i>

35:04.236 --> 35:05.602
- What a trip.
- Oh, my gosh.

35:05.604 --> 35:09.473
You never realize what you need
to work on until you get on it.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.308
<i>- Well, next up on the course,</i>

35:11.310 --> 35:13.810
<i>this is 23-year-old rookie
Adam Rayl</i>

35:13.812 --> 35:15.545
<i>from Phoenix, Arizona.</i>

35:15.547 --> 35:17.781
<i>Rayl was a walk-on
who had a terrific run</i>

35:17.783 --> 35:19.282
<i>in the L.A. city finals,</i>

35:19.284 --> 35:22.953
<i>and his number one fan is back
to watch him here in Vegas.</i>

35:24.490 --> 35:25.822
<i>Great transition. Power.</i>

35:25.824 --> 35:27.591
<i>- Los Angeles
was my first experience</i>

35:27.593 --> 35:28.758
<i>with "Ninja Warrior."</i>

35:28.760 --> 35:30.060
<i>- Whoo!</i>

35:30.062 --> 35:32.062
- My mom was
going absolutely nuts.

35:32.064 --> 35:34.598
- I have never been a reserved,

35:34.600 --> 35:37.234
clap politely kind of person.

35:37.236 --> 35:42.239
I'm all in, and no matter
what I'm doing, I love fully...

35:42.241 --> 35:43.707
Relax sweetie.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.309
And when it's my son out there,

35:46.311 --> 35:48.845
I feel as if
I'm running it with him.

35:48.847 --> 35:51.381
Yeah, good job!

35:51.383 --> 35:53.750
I'm so emotional.
I'm a basket case.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.885
<i>- I heard her a little bit.</i>

35:54.887 --> 35:56.453
<i>I was in kind of
the heat of battle</i>

35:56.455 --> 35:57.921
<i>and super focused
on what I was doing,</i>

35:57.923 --> 35:59.723
<i>but even through that
some of her screams</i>

35:59.725 --> 36:01.925
and crazy momness came through.

36:01.927 --> 36:03.927
<i>- Yes!</i>

36:03.929 --> 36:06.963
<i>I'm so proud of that boy.
I wouldn't be surprised</i>

36:06.965 --> 36:09.566
if he could make it
all the way.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.734
<i>- Seeing my mom tonight
at the competition</i>

36:10.736 --> 36:12.369
<i>is gonna be off the chain.</i>

36:12.371 --> 36:13.537
She's gonna be ridiculous.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.771
It's probably gonna
be embarrassing.

36:17.109 --> 36:19.509
<i>- And there's Mom, Vicki,</i>

36:19.511 --> 36:21.278
<i>already looking like
a basket case</i>

36:21.280 --> 36:23.747
<i>alongside
the rest of Adam's family.</i>

36:26.718 --> 36:29.052
<i>- Well, Rayl and his family
are a tight-knit group.</i>

36:29.054 --> 36:31.821
<i>They work together
building concrete tabletops.</i>

36:31.823 --> 36:33.990
<i>Rayl onto the Propeller Bar.</i>

36:33.992 --> 36:35.492
<i>- You develop
great grip strength</i>

36:35.494 --> 36:38.929
<i>lifting 100-pound blocks
of concrete every day.</i>

36:38.931 --> 36:40.730
<i>- Rayl 5'11", 180.</i>

36:40.732 --> 36:43.066
<i>Waited two weeks
in the walk-on line in L.A.</i>

36:43.068 --> 36:44.801
<i>but finished
the qualifying course</i>

36:44.803 --> 36:47.304
<i>and made it to the eighth
obstacle in the city finals.</i>

36:49.541 --> 36:51.575
<i>- Now taking on
the Giant Log Grip.</i>

36:51.577 --> 36:53.276
<i>Has to withstand
three violent drops</i>

36:53.278 --> 36:55.445
<i>on that 52-foot descent,</i>

36:55.447 --> 36:57.314
<i>and a high swing on the log.</i>

36:57.316 --> 36:59.049
<i>- That's some serious grip.</i>

36:59.051 --> 37:01.318
<i>Now just ease down
to the platform...</i>

37:01.320 --> 37:03.253
<i>- Nice.
- And the rookie's got it.</i>

37:03.255 --> 37:05.388
<i>Moving on
to the Jumping Spider.</i>

37:05.390 --> 37:08.692
- Go, hurry!
<i>- Oh, Mom is still nervous.</i>

37:08.694 --> 37:11.761
<i>- Well, we've seen
veterans struggle here,</i>

37:11.763 --> 37:13.930
<i>but he locks it in.</i>

37:13.932 --> 37:16.499
<i>Well, we haven't seen
a walk-on finish stage one</i>

37:16.501 --> 37:19.169
<i>since season six
when Abel Gonzalez did it,</i>

37:19.171 --> 37:22.839
<i>but Adam Rayl, wow,
looking very strong.</i>

37:24.343 --> 37:25.609
<i>- Nice!</i>

37:25.611 --> 37:28.912
<i>And he's making good time.</i>

37:28.914 --> 37:30.247
<i>He's got to keep that pace,
though,</i>

37:30.249 --> 37:32.549
<i>starting here with
the Sonic Curve.</i>

37:32.551 --> 37:35.952
<i>- Angle on those steps
increases as you go.</i>

37:35.954 --> 37:38.622
<i>- This walk-on rookie...</i>

37:38.624 --> 37:41.491
<i>A little trouble here
as seconds tick down,</i>

37:41.493 --> 37:43.026
<i>but he's through.</i>

37:44.529 --> 37:49.065
<i>Under a minute left.
Three obstacles to go.</i>

37:49.067 --> 37:51.901
<i>- And right up the wall!
- That was easy.</i>

37:51.903 --> 37:55.839
<i>- Adam Rayl
now on to Broken Bridge.</i>

37:55.841 --> 37:58.642
<i>He's got to pick up the pace
'cause the end is close</i>

37:58.644 --> 38:00.510
<i>but the Flying Squirrel,
as we've seen,</i>

38:00.512 --> 38:03.046
<i>eats up the clocks.</i>

38:03.048 --> 38:05.448
<i>- Oh!</i>

38:05.450 --> 38:08.685
<i>- Mom and this crowd
want to see another finisher.</i>

38:08.687 --> 38:11.187
<i>- And you can't exactly
overlook this obstacle.</i>

38:11.189 --> 38:13.323
<i>Tonight already
we've seen Jessell Boseman</i>

38:13.325 --> 38:16.593
<i>and Jon Alexis Jr.
flame out here.</i>

38:16.595 --> 38:18.662
<i>The clock is ticking down.</i>

38:18.664 --> 38:20.764
<i>Fight for your
ever-loving life!</i>

38:20.766 --> 38:24.100
<i>- Only 20 seconds left.
- Mama can't take it.</i>

38:25.170 --> 38:28.104
<i>- And not very high, Akbar.</i>

38:28.106 --> 38:29.839
<i>- Now he's moving, climbing.
- Get up.</i>

38:29.841 --> 38:31.574
<i>- It is gonna be close,
Akbar.</i>

38:31.576 --> 38:33.643
<i>- It's a tight one.
- Come on. Make it good.</i>

38:33.645 --> 38:37.547
<i>- The sirens sounding...</i>

38:37.549 --> 38:40.483
<i>but Mom can rest easy!</i>

38:40.485 --> 38:44.120
<i>The walk-on rookie our second
finisher of the night.</i>

38:50.395 --> 38:53.863
<i>- Adam almost went off
the rails at the Broken Bridge</i>

38:53.865 --> 38:56.666
<i>when he leapt over
that fifth step,</i>

38:56.668 --> 38:59.069
<i>but with time running out,
kept his composure</i>

38:59.071 --> 39:01.971
<i>while his mom
did just the opposite.</i>

39:01.973 --> 39:04.541
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine
for the POM Post Run Interview.</i>

39:04.543 --> 39:06.409
- Adam, congratulations.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.978
Not only a walk-on
but a rookie as well.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.347
How does this feel?

39:10.349 --> 39:11.748
- It feels amazing.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.450
To do that well
feels really, really good.

39:13.452 --> 39:16.586
<i>- Your mom was so emotional
tonight during your entire run.</i>

39:16.588 --> 39:18.021
You're still...
you're still emotional.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.489
Why are you crying?

39:19.491 --> 39:22.125
- It's... it's... I know
how hard he's worked,

39:22.127 --> 39:25.161
and the whole family
has been there to support him,

39:25.163 --> 39:27.931
and it's just so thrilling.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.532
<i>I'm just filled right up.</i>

39:29.534 --> 39:31.101
- Well,
keep on supporting him

39:31.103 --> 39:33.303
'cause he now
has to go get stage two.

39:33.305 --> 39:34.671
- Yes!
- Congratulations.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.973
I'll let you enjoy the win.
Guys, back to you.

39:36.975 --> 39:40.176
<i>- Well, we only have
ten finishers so far</i>

39:40.178 --> 39:43.079
<i>here at stage one
including the two from tonight,</i>

39:43.081 --> 39:45.348
<i>Josh Levin and now Adam Rayl.</i>

39:45.350 --> 39:48.852
<i>Surprisingly, our only two
finishers tonight are rookies,</i>

39:48.854 --> 39:51.921
<i>but lots more athletes
have yet to take on the course.</i>

39:51.923 --> 39:54.090
<i>Coming up, he's fearless...</i>

39:54.092 --> 39:55.925
- Ah!

39:55.927 --> 39:57.327
<i>- And he's wild.</i>

39:57.329 --> 39:58.862
<i>- Train ordinary, be ordinary.</i>

39:58.864 --> 40:01.731
<i>- Brace yourselves
for Crazy Craver.</i>

40:01.733 --> 40:03.700
- Bringing the crazy
back to Vegas!

40:03.702 --> 40:07.203
<i>- Plus, last year's
first American Ninja Warrior...</i>

40:07.205 --> 40:09.105
<i>Geoff Britten did it!</i>

40:09.107 --> 40:11.241
<i>Is making his return
to stage one...</i>

40:11.243 --> 40:12.809
- But this year,
I'm gonna win it.

40:12.811 --> 40:16.946
<i>- And we'll talk to him next on
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

40:20.785 --> 40:22.118
<i>- He is flying!</i>

40:22.120 --> 40:25.288
<i>Some said
it could never be done.</i>

40:25.290 --> 40:28.625
<i>He did it!
Geoff Britten did it!</i>

40:28.627 --> 40:32.262
<i>Tonight, the first American
Ninja Warrior, Geoff Britten,</i>

40:32.264 --> 40:35.064
<i>is looking to hit
four buzzers again.</i>

40:35.066 --> 40:37.400
<i>Right now he's with Kristine.</i>

40:37.402 --> 40:38.468
- Matt, thank you.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.303
Geoff, we are back here
in Las Vegas

40:40.305 --> 40:42.839
where you made history
by becoming the first man

40:42.841 --> 40:44.607
to reach the top
of Mount Midoriyama.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.643
As we stand here
now back in its shadow,

40:46.645 --> 40:49.145
how are feeling and what's
going through your mind?

40:49.147 --> 40:50.847
- You know, it was
really strange coming back

40:50.849 --> 40:52.649
and seeing the course,
seeing Mount Midoriyama.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.184
I'm a little nervous.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.286
I'm a little excited,
but I feel good.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.587
<i>I've trained right.</i>

40:57.589 --> 41:00.356
<i>I've prepared,
and I'm gonna give it my shot.</i>

41:00.358 --> 41:03.259
- How do you handle the pressure
of everyone watching you

41:03.261 --> 41:05.662
as the first
American Ninja Warrior?

41:05.664 --> 41:08.598
- I don't know.
- I... I try and breathe.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.066
I try and look at this like

41:10.068 --> 41:12.502
it's the greatest playground
for adults,

41:12.504 --> 41:14.838
and I go out there
and I try and have fun.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.272
- I'm so excited
to see you run.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.373
- Good luck, Geoff.
- Thank you.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.309
- Guys, back to you.

41:19.311 --> 41:20.577
<i>- Thanks, Kristine.</i>

41:20.579 --> 41:22.445
<i>Well, from one ninja great
to another,</i>

41:22.447 --> 41:24.814
<i>- next up...</i>
- Whoo!

41:24.816 --> 41:26.549
<i>- One of the most
accomplished ninjas</i>

41:26.551 --> 41:28.017
<i>in the competition...</i>

41:28.019 --> 41:31.488
<i>a 27-year-old gym owner
out of Fairfield, Connecticut,</i>

41:31.490 --> 41:33.122
<i>Drew Drechsel.</i>

41:33.124 --> 41:34.457
<i>The man known
as the "Real Life Ninja"</i>

41:34.459 --> 41:36.793
<i>is coming off
his best season ever,</i>

41:36.795 --> 41:40.663
<i>and his biggest fans are here
to push him to the top.</i>

41:42.033 --> 41:43.566
<i>- After beating the qualifying,</i>

41:43.568 --> 41:46.135
<i>beating semifinals,
making it to Las Vegas,</i>

41:46.137 --> 41:47.470
the pressure starts to build.

41:47.472 --> 41:48.938
<i>- What a performance
out of the man</i>

41:48.940 --> 41:51.641
<i>they call
the "Real Life Ninja."</i>

41:51.643 --> 41:55.044
- I own a ninja gym.
- I teach ninja kids...

41:55.046 --> 41:57.080
Good landing.
Good. Good.

41:57.082 --> 41:58.882
<i>And this year all my kids
that I teach</i>

41:58.884 --> 42:00.450
are coming out here
to cheer me on.

42:00.452 --> 42:02.385
And we're gonna
start running laps.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.955
The better I do, the more these
kids are gonna look up to me,

42:05.957 --> 42:07.924
<i>the more they're gonna be
motivated to train hard</i>

42:07.926 --> 42:09.792
<i>and play around like I am.</i>

42:09.794 --> 42:11.561
Good job.

42:11.563 --> 42:14.230
Having my own little section
of the stands cheering my name

42:14.232 --> 42:16.332
who knows me
and they're here for me.

42:16.334 --> 42:17.567
There you go.

42:17.569 --> 42:19.469
Yeah,
that's a lot of pressure...

42:19.471 --> 42:20.803
- Okay, Grayson, run, run, run!
- Oh!

42:20.805 --> 42:22.005
- Ah, look at how close
you are!

42:22.007 --> 42:23.640
<i>But you got to learn
to block it out</i>

42:23.642 --> 42:25.241
<i>because if you let it
weigh you down,</i>

42:25.243 --> 42:26.743
<i>the course is gonna be
a lot harder,</i>

42:26.745 --> 42:29.546
so I'm ready,
and I'm gonna kill it.

42:31.516 --> 42:33.950
<i>- It was a long trip
from Connecticut,</i>

42:33.952 --> 42:36.653
<i>but all the kids wearing
"Real Life Ninja" T-shirts,</i>

42:36.655 --> 42:38.221
<i>ready for Drew's run.</i>

42:38.223 --> 42:39.656
<i>One of his star students Tom</i>

42:39.658 --> 42:42.225
<i>cheering alongside
Drew's girlfriend April.</i>

42:42.227 --> 42:43.893
<i>- And you know
Drew wants to</i>

42:43.895 --> 42:45.862
<i>put on a show for these kids.</i>

42:45.864 --> 42:48.398
<i>- Well, one thing we know
about Drew Drechsel,</i>

42:48.400 --> 42:51.134
<i>he is built for speed,
and you can see the speed here.</i>

42:51.136 --> 42:52.802
<i>Do what you do, Drew.</i>

42:52.804 --> 42:54.304
<i>- Well, we talked to...
- Ooh, miss!</i>

42:54.306 --> 42:55.705
<i>- Missed the rope,
but look at that.</i>

42:55.707 --> 42:57.473
<i>He has such good momentum
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

42:57.475 --> 42:59.742
<i>Barely cost him a few seconds.
Drew Drechsel.</i>

42:59.744 --> 43:03.112
<i>Speed's not gonna be an issue.
It's gonna be surviving.</i>

43:03.114 --> 43:04.747
<i>- Drew now at
the Giant Log Grip.</i>

43:04.749 --> 43:05.949
<i>- We've seen a lot of people</i>

43:05.951 --> 43:07.951
<i>have trouble
sticking this dismount.</i>

43:07.953 --> 43:09.752
<i>- Well, Matt, I think...
- Look, he's going sideways.</i>

43:09.754 --> 43:11.654
<i>- Well, I can tell you
it's a good way to get vision.</i>

43:11.656 --> 43:14.223
<i>I'm a Drew believer that
he's gonna get this landing.</i>

43:14.225 --> 43:16.092
<i>- Whoa!
- That was so close.</i>

43:16.094 --> 43:17.594
<i>- So close.</i>

43:17.596 --> 43:20.163
<i>- Yeah, that wasn't the splash
he was looking to make.</i>

43:20.165 --> 43:23.132
<i>- Impressive stop there,
but now the Jumping Spider.</i>

43:23.134 --> 43:26.603
<i>Hopefully he stayed dry.
You need traction here.</i>

43:26.605 --> 43:28.471
<i>- All right. Don't...
- Oh!</i>

43:28.473 --> 43:30.673
<i>- Make that stick... oh, no, no!
- That's what I'm saying.</i>

43:30.675 --> 43:32.175
<i>- Stay out of there.
- Stay low there.</i>

43:32.177 --> 43:34.310
<i>- You got to below the red bar,
now up above the gap.</i>

43:34.312 --> 43:38.581
<i>- Look at him fly through
inside of that Jumping Spider.</i>

43:38.583 --> 43:39.782
<i>- And he's through.</i>

43:39.784 --> 43:41.851
<i>Like I said,
time's not an issue.</i>

43:41.853 --> 43:43.853
<i>Just needs to avoid
a mistake.</i>

43:43.855 --> 43:45.955
<i>- Drew can teach his students
about agility here</i>

43:45.957 --> 43:47.390
<i>at Sonic Curve.</i>

43:47.392 --> 43:49.959
<i>- And exploding through
the Sonic Curve.</i>

43:49.961 --> 43:52.395
<i>- Ooh, more like
sonic boom there.</i>

43:52.397 --> 43:53.696
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh!</i>

43:53.698 --> 43:56.165
<i>Just hangs on
to stick the dismount.</i>

43:56.167 --> 43:57.500
<i>- I got to say,</i>

43:57.502 --> 43:59.135
<i>this whole year
we've seen a measured,</i>

43:59.137 --> 44:01.471
<i>more mature Drechsel
than ever before.</i>

44:01.473 --> 44:03.539
<i>- Warped Wall should be
no issue for this man.</i>

44:03.541 --> 44:06.676
<i>He is purpose-built
for stage one.</i>

44:06.678 --> 44:09.145
<i>- Yeah, he is so agile,
but he's got to stay light</i>

44:09.147 --> 44:11.180
<i>on his feet here
at the Broken Bridge.</i>

44:11.182 --> 44:13.349
<i>This is a new obstacle for him.</i>

44:13.351 --> 44:15.618
<i>- You can see him
analyzing the path.</i>

44:15.620 --> 44:18.087
<i>Six steps.
Got to hit them in the center.</i>

44:18.089 --> 44:19.522
<i>Using up time, though.</i>

44:21.459 --> 44:23.660
<i>- Boom, boom, pow. Ooh!
- Ooh, a little stumble,</i>

44:23.662 --> 44:25.128
<i>but the momentum
carries him through.</i>

44:25.130 --> 44:27.864
<i>- That almost knocked
the wind out of him.</i>

44:27.866 --> 44:28.998
<i>- One obstacle left,
and, Akbar,</i>

44:29.000 --> 44:30.733
<i>I've been looking forward</i>

44:30.735 --> 44:34.003
<i>to seeing Drew Drechsel
take on the Flying Squirrel.</i>

44:34.005 --> 44:37.140
<i>- Well, nobody in this
sport flies higher</i>

44:37.142 --> 44:39.709
<i>or farther
than the Real Life Ninja.</i>

44:40.812 --> 44:42.011
<i>- Just like that.</i>

44:42.013 --> 44:43.246
<i>- Well, here's what
he needs to do.</i>

44:43.248 --> 44:45.748
<i>Get up high on the net,
minimize that climb,</i>

44:45.750 --> 44:47.350
<i>or he might time out.</i>

44:47.352 --> 44:51.120
<i>- Whoo!
- Did you see how high he got?</i>

44:51.122 --> 44:54.390
<i>- Well, he cut it close,
but Drew Drechsel...</i>

44:54.392 --> 44:55.992
<i>- Did he do a caterpillar
there?</i>

44:55.994 --> 44:57.627
- Whoo!

44:57.629 --> 45:01.531
<i>- The Real Life Ninja
does it again,</i>

45:01.533 --> 45:02.699
<i>moving on to stage two</i>

45:02.701 --> 45:04.834
<i>for the fourth time
in his career.</i>

45:04.836 --> 45:08.004
- Whoo!

45:08.006 --> 45:09.472
<i>- At the Broken Bridge,</i>

45:09.474 --> 45:12.508
<i>Drew taught his students
how important speed can be,</i>

45:12.510 --> 45:14.744
<i>and he schooled
the Flying Squirrel</i>

45:14.746 --> 45:17.080
<i>with that high lache
to the cargo net.</i>

45:17.082 --> 45:21.350
<i>Drew Drechsel with a master
class performance on stage one.</i>

45:21.352 --> 45:22.885
<i>- After a rough start tonight,</i>

45:22.887 --> 45:24.954
<i>we're starting
to see some finishers.</i>

45:24.956 --> 45:26.589
<i>Drew Drechsel's moving on,</i>

45:26.591 --> 45:28.658
<i>and he's standing by
with Kristine.</i>

45:28.660 --> 45:30.760
- I know how badly
you want to get past

45:30.762 --> 45:32.695
where you did last year,
make it to stage four.

45:32.697 --> 45:35.598
- Why is this the year for you?
- I've been training harder.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.800
Every year I find out
what my weaknesses are,

45:37.802 --> 45:40.269
and right now I've been building
on all of my weaknesses.

45:40.271 --> 45:41.604
I feel like I really
don't have any,

45:41.606 --> 45:43.740
so it's just strengths
from here on out.

45:43.742 --> 45:45.541
- There is something
about your attitude this year.

45:45.543 --> 45:47.610
It's making me feel
very positive for you.

45:47.612 --> 45:48.911
Congratulations.
We'll see you on stage two.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.279
- Thank you, Kristine.
- Thank you very much.

45:50.281 --> 45:52.949
- Guys, back to you.

45:52.951 --> 45:53.950
<i>- Coming up...</i>

45:53.952 --> 45:55.785
<i>- Whoo!
- Wow.</i>

45:55.787 --> 45:58.387
<i>- He electrified Philly
two weeks ago.</i>

45:58.389 --> 46:01.457
<i>- Fly like a phoenix bird.
- I see you, baby.</i>

46:01.459 --> 46:04.026
<i>- How high can The Phoenix,
Najee Richardson,</i>

46:04.028 --> 46:05.128
<i>soar tonight...</i>

46:05.130 --> 46:07.029
- I will dominate stage one.

46:07.031 --> 46:09.532
<i>- And later,
she's still the only woman</i>

46:09.534 --> 46:11.734
<i>ever to finish
a city finals course.</i>

46:11.736 --> 46:14.771
<i>Kacy Catanzaro has done it!</i>

46:14.773 --> 46:18.708
<i>Tonight, Mighty Kacy returns
to the national finals...</i>

46:18.710 --> 46:19.942
- Here we go, Vegas.

46:19.944 --> 46:23.479
<i>- When "American
Ninja Warrior" returns.</i>

46:26.316 --> 46:28.317
<i>- Welcome back to Las Vegas.</i>

46:28.319 --> 46:30.153
Are you ready
for some football?

46:30.155 --> 46:32.021
- Oh, you know I am.
- Ahh!

46:32.023 --> 46:33.556
- Well, the season
kicks off on NBC

46:33.558 --> 46:35.591
this Thursday at 7:30 Eastern

46:35.593 --> 46:38.594
when my team, the world
champion Denver Broncos,

46:38.596 --> 46:41.030
hosts the Carolina Panthers
in a Super Bowl rematch.

46:41.032 --> 46:42.665
- Yeah, watch out
for my Raiders this year.

46:42.667 --> 46:45.434
- I told you.
- Hope springs eternal.

46:45.436 --> 46:48.571
<i>- Well, our next competitor
is likely an Eagles fan.</i>

46:48.573 --> 46:51.874
<i>This is 25-year-old fitness
coach Najee Richardson,</i>

46:51.876 --> 46:53.876
<i>the man they call
"The Phoenix."</i>

46:53.878 --> 46:55.344
<i>He was once a top-level gymnast</i>

46:55.346 --> 46:57.747
<i>before injuries
ended his career,</i>

46:57.749 --> 46:59.015
<i>but "American Ninja Warrior's"</i>

46:59.017 --> 47:01.450
<i>helped this phoenix
rise from the ashes.</i>

47:04.856 --> 47:08.257
<i>- I grew up in a pretty
rough area of Philadelphia.</i>

47:08.259 --> 47:12.962
It had a lot of gang activity,
a lot of crime.

47:13.998 --> 47:16.065
<i>Those are my roots.</i>

47:16.067 --> 47:19.468
<i>My parents put me in gymnastics
at the age of ten.</i>

47:19.470 --> 47:21.304
- Come on, Naj!

47:21.306 --> 47:22.939
Nice!

47:22.941 --> 47:24.707
- I immediately
fell in love with it,

47:24.709 --> 47:27.944
<i>so it was a huge, huge part of
my life growing up.</i>

47:29.848 --> 47:32.682
- That's not cheap.
- It wasn't cheap at all,

47:32.684 --> 47:35.218
<i>but I did that because
I loved him so much</i>

47:35.220 --> 47:38.120
<i>and because I wanted him
to be a better person.</i>

47:40.024 --> 47:42.725
<i>- It's been quite a journey
going from my childhood</i>

47:42.727 --> 47:46.229
<i>to now being here in Las Vegas</i>

47:46.231 --> 47:48.397
doing "American Ninja Warrior."

47:48.399 --> 47:51.901
<i>- I know Najee is gonna
go all the way,</i>

47:51.903 --> 47:54.704
and we're coming home
with $1 million.

47:54.706 --> 47:56.772
That's what I predict
because that's what he wants,

47:56.774 --> 47:59.075
and I think he deserves it.

47:59.077 --> 48:01.444
- Yeah!

48:01.446 --> 48:03.779
<i>- And there's Mom and
girlfriend</i>

48:03.781 --> 48:05.615
<i>sporting
"The Phoenix" T-shirts.</i>

48:05.617 --> 48:08.317
<i>His dad cheering him on
from home in Philly.</i>

48:11.456 --> 48:15.958
<i>Najee 5'7" and 155 pounds
of solid muscle...</i>

48:15.960 --> 48:19.061
<i>and going right into
the Propeller Bar...</i>

48:19.063 --> 48:20.763
<i>but misses the rope!</i>

48:20.765 --> 48:21.797
<i>- Uh-oh, going around
on that propeller</i>

48:21.799 --> 48:24.033
<i>eats up precious time.</i>

48:24.035 --> 48:26.569
<i>- Having trouble reaching
that rope on the Propeller Bar,</i>

48:26.571 --> 48:28.738
<i>but look at him
kipping his body to move it.</i>

48:28.740 --> 48:30.006
<i>- He's getting
the helicopter moving.</i>

48:30.008 --> 48:31.574
<i>- Well, that is
a gymnast right there.</i>

48:31.576 --> 48:33.209
<i>That's a man who has excellent
body awareness.</i>

48:33.211 --> 48:35.578
- Go, Najee!

48:35.580 --> 48:37.747
<i>- Now moving on
to the Giant Log Grip.</i>

48:37.749 --> 48:39.815
<i>- You know, I had a chance
to talk with him earlier.</i>

48:39.817 --> 48:42.518
<i>He said he was worried
about being on a timed course,</i>

48:42.520 --> 48:44.453
<i>but right here
he should just worry</i>

48:44.455 --> 48:47.123
<i>about timing his dismount
to the pad.</i>

48:47.125 --> 48:49.625
<i>- He's got it.</i>

48:49.627 --> 48:51.227
<i>Now the Jumping Spider.</i>

48:51.229 --> 48:54.263
<i>A challenge, but Richardson,
a vault expert.</i>

48:54.265 --> 48:57.233
<i>Expect him to launch off
this tramp and lock in.</i>

48:57.235 --> 48:58.801
<i>- Well, we know this thing
has been spitting out</i>

48:58.803 --> 49:00.636
<i>some serious venom,
the Jumping Spider.</i>

49:00.638 --> 49:01.837
<i>Ooh.</i>

49:01.839 --> 49:03.339
<i>- I see Najee's got
the serum here.</i>

49:03.341 --> 49:05.408
<i>- Impressive way
to lock in there.</i>

49:05.410 --> 49:08.144
<i>Looking like Peter Parker
himself there.</i>

49:08.146 --> 49:11.681
<i>- Ooh!
- And Najee making great time.</i>

49:11.683 --> 49:12.982
<i>- On now to the Sonic Curve.</i>

49:12.984 --> 49:15.117
<i>This guy is an impressive,
explosive athlete.</i>

49:15.119 --> 49:16.786
<i>- Yeah, he is, Matt.
- We've seen his strength.</i>

49:16.788 --> 49:18.554
<i>We've seen his ability,
and watch him</i>

49:18.556 --> 49:21.190
<i>just ride the lean there
on the Sonic Curve.</i>

49:21.192 --> 49:25.328
<i>- Having a little trouble
on the dismount here...</i>

49:25.330 --> 49:27.663
<i>- But missed it again.
- Oh, watch yourself here.</i>

49:27.665 --> 49:30.900
<i>- Good push and still a minute
left now for the final three,</i>

49:30.902 --> 49:32.568
<i>starting with the Warped Wall.</i>

49:32.570 --> 49:34.570
<i>- Get right into that.
- Ride that speed there.</i>

49:34.572 --> 49:36.105
<i>Shorter run-up there,</i>

49:36.107 --> 49:38.307
<i>but nothing
for Najee Richardson.</i>

49:38.309 --> 49:41.510
<i>- And The Phoenix two obstacles
away from the buzzer.</i>

49:41.512 --> 49:44.947
<i>- His gymnastics career
was cut short by knee injury.</i>

49:44.949 --> 49:48.050
<i>Be careful here
on the Broken Bridge.</i>

49:48.052 --> 49:49.218
<i>- Ooh!
- Ooh!</i>

49:49.220 --> 49:50.486
<i>- Oh, man!
- A good fall,</i>

49:50.488 --> 49:53.022
<i>but that last span
held him up, Akbar.</i>

49:53.024 --> 49:54.957
<i>And now Najee with over</i>

49:54.959 --> 49:58.294
<i>a half minute to get through
the Flying Squirrel.</i>

49:58.296 --> 50:00.329
<i>- Excellent body control.
- Yeah, and... and as a gymnast,</i>

50:00.331 --> 50:02.298
<i>he knows how to move
his body here.</i>

50:02.300 --> 50:04.533
<i>No double pumping.
Go for broke here, Najee.</i>

50:04.535 --> 50:07.403
<i>- Good job holding on.
- He is really kipping.</i>

50:07.405 --> 50:09.805
<i>- Oh, you see... you see
the way he get there?</i>

50:09.807 --> 50:11.207
<i>He looks like
he's in the gymnastic vault.</i>

50:11.209 --> 50:13.242
<i>- Wow!
- Whoo!</i>

50:13.244 --> 50:15.745
<i>- So high on the cargo net.
- I see you, baby!</i>

50:15.747 --> 50:17.680
<i>- It looks like
we're going to have</i>

50:17.682 --> 50:21.117
<i>our fourth finisher
of the night.</i>

50:26.124 --> 50:28.190
<i>- And look at this.
- In his second year,</i>

50:28.192 --> 50:31.027
<i>Najee Richardson's
going on to stage two.</i>

50:33.031 --> 50:36.265
- Whoo!
- Ah, that was awesome.

50:36.267 --> 50:38.567
<i>- The Broken Bridge
nearly broke his hip.</i>

50:38.569 --> 50:40.569
<i>He tried to skip
that fifth step</i>

50:40.571 --> 50:42.405
<i>and came up short
on number six</i>

50:42.407 --> 50:44.106
<i>but managed to survive.</i>

50:44.108 --> 50:46.175
<i>And look,
even he was surprised!</i>

50:46.177 --> 50:47.910
<i>And on the Flying Squirrel</i>

50:47.912 --> 50:50.413
<i>check out the hang time
the former gymnast got</i>

50:50.415 --> 50:52.648
<i>with that lache
to the cargo net.</i>

50:52.650 --> 50:54.150
<i>The Phoenix flew,</i>

50:54.152 --> 50:56.419
<i>and now he's the fourth
finisher tonight.</i>

50:56.421 --> 50:59.488
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine
for the POM Post Run Interview.</i>

50:59.490 --> 51:00.923
- Najee, you said
you were worried

51:00.925 --> 51:02.258
about the time here
tonight.

51:02.260 --> 51:04.460
You had 8 seconds
left on the clock.

51:04.462 --> 51:06.562
Were you aware,
and how rushed did you feel?

51:06.564 --> 51:07.763
- I... I had no idea.

51:07.765 --> 51:09.065
I wasn't really paying
attention to the time.

51:09.067 --> 51:10.733
I just knew I made
a couple of mistakes

51:10.735 --> 51:12.201
and I was a little worried
about that,

51:12.203 --> 51:14.537
<i>so I really started to pick up
my pace after the Warped Wall.</i>

51:14.539 --> 51:17.440
- How does it feel to hit
a buzzer in Las Vegas?

51:17.442 --> 51:20.476
- It feels awesome. I can't
really put it into words.

51:20.478 --> 51:22.111
<i>It... it feels amazing.</i>

51:22.113 --> 51:23.979
- Let's carry that
confidence into stage two.

51:23.981 --> 51:25.915
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

51:25.917 --> 51:28.384
- Matt and Akbar,
back up to you.

51:28.386 --> 51:32.388
<i>- Well, the successes are
starting to mount on stage one,</i>

51:32.390 --> 51:34.990
<i>and that now includes
Najee Richardson.</i>

51:34.992 --> 51:36.959
<i>Still only 12 total finishers</i>

51:36.961 --> 51:38.727
<i>between nights one and two,</i>

51:38.729 --> 51:42.598
<i>but many of our top competitors
about to hit the course.</i>

51:42.600 --> 51:46.102
<i>Well, Meagan Martin's made
history on stage one before,</i>

51:46.104 --> 51:49.171
<i>and she's looking to join
Jessie Graff on stage two.</i>

51:49.173 --> 51:50.973
<i>Her run's just ahead.</i>

51:50.975 --> 51:54.143
<i>Plus, he's been fired up
all year long.</i>

51:54.145 --> 51:56.946
- Ahh!
<i>- The ninja golden boy</i>

51:56.948 --> 52:00.349
<i>Crazy Craver is ready to burn
through stage one...</i>

52:00.351 --> 52:01.984
- Crazy's back.

52:01.986 --> 52:04.887
<i>- When "American
Ninja Warrior" returns.</i>

52:06.990 --> 52:09.358
<i>- Welcome back to night two
of the national finals</i>

52:09.360 --> 52:11.026
<i>of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

52:11.028 --> 52:12.461
<i>While we were away,</i>

52:12.463 --> 52:15.631
<i>three more athletes
took their shot at stage one.</i>

52:15.633 --> 52:17.500
<i>Las Vegas resident
Chris Workman</i>

52:17.502 --> 52:19.702
<i>got the hometown
crowd fired up...</i>

52:19.704 --> 52:21.837
Workman! Workman!

52:21.839 --> 52:23.606
<i>- But the 5'4" app developer</i>

52:23.608 --> 52:26.442
<i>couldn't handle the dismount
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

52:26.444 --> 52:29.612
<i>- Unfortunately,
no app for a do-over.</i>

52:29.614 --> 52:32.248
<i>- Entomology student
Eric Middleton</i>

52:32.250 --> 52:34.416
<i>flew like a butterfly...</i>

52:34.418 --> 52:35.851
<i>- He just crushed
the Jumping Spider.</i>

52:35.853 --> 52:37.319
<i>I thought he loved bugs.</i>

52:37.321 --> 52:40.623
<i>- But his snail-like pace
meant he ran out of time,</i>

52:40.625 --> 52:43.826
<i>and the bug man went splat
at the Flying Squirrel.</i>

52:43.828 --> 52:45.594
<i>- Oh!</i>

52:45.596 --> 52:49.231
<i>- Acrobat Nicholas Coolridge
harnessed his trapeze skills</i>

52:49.233 --> 52:51.200
<i>to get through
the Flying Squirrel...</i>

52:51.202 --> 52:54.136
<i>Real nice. Excellent form.</i>

52:54.138 --> 52:57.439
<i>Becoming the fifth competitor
to hit the buzzer tonight.</i>

52:57.441 --> 52:58.908
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

52:58.910 --> 53:02.678
<i>- Hey!
- Hey!</i>

53:04.549 --> 53:07.483
<i>- So we're now up to
13 finishers,</i>

53:07.485 --> 53:10.286
<i>and our next competitor
would love to join that list.</i>

53:10.288 --> 53:11.754
<i>From Boulder, Colorado,</i>

53:11.756 --> 53:15.257
<i>it's 26-year-old
rock climber Meagan Martin.</i>

53:15.259 --> 53:17.593
<i>She and Jessie Graff
have had a friendly rivalry.</i>

53:17.595 --> 53:20.362
Beat that wall!

53:20.364 --> 53:23.599
<i>- Meagan conquered the
Warped Wall in season six.</i>

53:23.601 --> 53:25.334
<i>- She's done it!</i>

53:25.336 --> 53:27.770
<i>- A season later,
Jessie matched her.</i>

53:27.772 --> 53:30.306
<i>- Jessie Graff
is the fourth woman</i>

53:30.308 --> 53:32.241
<i>ever to get up
the Warped Wall!</i>

53:32.243 --> 53:35.778
<i>- Meagan was the first woman
to conquer the Jumping Spider.</i>

53:35.780 --> 53:37.880
<i>Last year,
Jessie followed suit...</i>

53:37.882 --> 53:40.849
<i>- And a few more feet
and she'll join Meagan Martin,</i>

53:40.851 --> 53:43.152
<i>and she's done it!</i>

53:43.154 --> 53:47.089
<i>- But this year
it's Jessie who set the mark.</i>

53:47.091 --> 53:51.594
- The first woman ever
to complete stage one!

53:51.596 --> 53:54.129
<i>- Can Meagan keep pace?</i>

53:54.131 --> 53:57.266
<i>Well, Jessie Graff
has a front row seat.</i>

53:57.268 --> 53:58.867
- Go Meagan!
<i>- Also cheering Meagan on</i>

53:58.869 --> 54:01.403
<i>are her parents and her
Wolfpack training partners</i>

54:01.405 --> 54:03.505
<i>Ian Dory and Brian Arnold.</i>

54:03.507 --> 54:05.274
<i>So here we go.</i>

54:05.276 --> 54:08.811
<i>Meagan Martin with her third
go round at stage one,</i>

54:08.813 --> 54:10.646
<i>looking to join
Jessie on stage two.</i>

54:10.648 --> 54:13.015
<i>The last two years on
stage one she's made it</i>

54:13.017 --> 54:14.650
<i>to the Warped Wall,</i>

54:14.652 --> 54:17.019
<i>the only woman ever to do so
along with Jessie Graff.</i>

54:17.021 --> 54:19.788
<i>Hasn't been able to make it up.
Can this be her year?</i>

54:19.790 --> 54:21.323
<i>- Well, Matt,
for Meagan Martin,</i>

54:21.325 --> 54:23.759
<i>she's one of the strongest
women I've ever seen</i>

54:23.761 --> 54:26.262
<i>and one of the strongest
competitors here tonight.</i>

54:26.264 --> 54:27.863
<i>Watch Meagan Martin crush this.</i>

54:27.865 --> 54:31.367
<i>- Wow, great leap.
- Great power.</i>

54:31.369 --> 54:32.668
<i>- Using her 5'3" body.</i>

54:32.670 --> 54:34.536
<i>Using her grip strength
here on the rope.</i>

54:34.538 --> 54:37.640
<i>- And look at that climber.
- So strong, Meagan Martin.</i>

54:37.642 --> 54:39.908
- Yeah, baby!
<i>- Her rock climbing experience</i>

54:39.910 --> 54:42.511
<i>comes into play here
on the Giant Log Grip.</i>

54:42.513 --> 54:45.180
<i>I've been raving about Meagan
Martin and her strength.</i>

54:45.182 --> 54:46.849
<i>There's a reason
why she's here.</i>

54:46.851 --> 54:49.785
<i>She's earned her right
to be here in Las Vegas.</i>

54:49.787 --> 54:51.020
<i>- This dismount, though,
has been difficult.</i>

54:51.022 --> 54:52.021
<i>Oh... sliding! Oh!</i>

54:52.023 --> 54:53.989
- Oh, shoot!

54:53.991 --> 54:56.258
- No! What?

54:56.260 --> 54:59.862
<i>- Dang.
- This crowd is stunned.</i>

55:02.867 --> 55:05.301
<i>- And remarkably
the rock climber,</i>

55:05.303 --> 55:07.870
<i>the grip strength gives out,</i>

55:07.872 --> 55:13.142
<i>and Meagan Martin cast off
by the Giant Log Grip.</i>

55:13.144 --> 55:16.945
<i>- Seriously, those drops on
the Giant Log Grip are no joke.</i>

55:16.947 --> 55:19.248
<i>Look at Meagan's face
after the first drop.</i>

55:19.250 --> 55:22.551
<i>She was fighting it,
but the jolt of the second drop</i>

55:22.553 --> 55:24.186
<i>knocked her hands loose,</i>

55:24.188 --> 55:26.255
<i>and her run came
to an early end.</i>

55:26.257 --> 55:28.257
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine.</i>

55:28.259 --> 55:29.558
- Meagan, the Log Grip
is an obstacle

55:29.560 --> 55:31.760
that really plays
to your skill set.

55:31.762 --> 55:33.696
What do you think
went wrong for you?

55:33.698 --> 55:35.731
- In all honesty,
I think when I got on, like,

55:35.733 --> 55:38.200
I wasn't squeezing
with my legs enough, maybe.

55:38.202 --> 55:39.501
I don't know.

55:39.503 --> 55:41.737
Just when the last drop,
it, like,

55:41.739 --> 55:44.206
kind of started throwing me
really fast, so I thought,

55:44.208 --> 55:46.675
<i>"Oh, maybe I'll just be able
to get thrown onto the pad,"</i>

55:46.677 --> 55:47.843
<i>and then I missed it,</i>

55:47.845 --> 55:50.012
but you know, I mean,
these things happen.

55:50.014 --> 55:51.146
Like, nobody's perfect.

55:51.148 --> 55:53.716
It's impossible
to always be on,

55:53.718 --> 55:55.584
<i>and you know,
this is just an off day.</i>

55:55.586 --> 55:56.952
- Meagan, you've done
such a great job

55:56.954 --> 55:58.087
representing
the women out here.

55:58.089 --> 55:59.288
I know that
you're gonna be back.

55:59.290 --> 56:02.491
- Definitely.
- Matt and Akbar, back to you.

56:02.493 --> 56:04.026
<i>- Thanks, Kristine.</i>

56:04.028 --> 56:06.962
<i>Well, this course is gonna
get just a little crazier.</i>

56:06.964 --> 56:09.431
<i>Up next
in the gold lamé shorts,</i>

56:09.433 --> 56:12.935
<i>it's 35-year-old photographer
Neil "Crazy" Craver.</i>

56:12.937 --> 56:15.337
<i>He may be a "Ninja Warrior,"
wild child,</i>

56:15.339 --> 56:18.440
<i>but now he's more
balanced than ever.</i>

56:18.442 --> 56:22.344
- Train ordinary, be ordinary.

56:22.346 --> 56:23.679
<i>They call me "Crazy Craver."</i>

56:25.483 --> 56:26.782
<i>Preparing for Vegas this year,</i>

56:26.784 --> 56:28.951
<i>I changed up things
a little bit.</i>

56:28.953 --> 56:32.321
I started dating Chloe.
She's a yoga teacher.

56:32.323 --> 56:34.223
She introduced yoga to me,

56:34.225 --> 56:36.325
<i>and it... it just fell
into place like,</i>

56:36.327 --> 56:39.328
"This is what I need
to counteract my crazy."

56:39.330 --> 56:40.529
Ahh!

56:40.531 --> 56:42.598
<i>- He's still very crazy.</i>

56:42.600 --> 56:45.367
I tell him probably ten times
a day like, "Be careful,"

56:46.704 --> 56:48.070
<i>And then he says,
"I'm not Careful Craver.</i>

56:48.072 --> 56:50.506
I'm Crazy Craver," so...

56:50.508 --> 56:51.540
- Aah!

56:51.542 --> 56:53.108
<i>Yoga's given me
a lot of peace</i>

56:53.110 --> 56:54.309
<i>and a lot of discipline,</i>

56:54.311 --> 56:55.911
but when I get on the course,

56:55.913 --> 56:58.647
the crazy is just
too much to contain.

56:58.649 --> 57:00.916
I'm bringing the crazy
back to Vegas!

57:03.387 --> 57:06.722
<i>- And there's his girlfriend
and yoga teacher, Chloe.</i>

57:06.724 --> 57:08.490
<i>Also among those
cheering him on,</i>

57:08.492 --> 57:10.793
<i>friend and fellow ninja
Grant McCartney,</i>

57:10.795 --> 57:12.294
<i>who finished stage one
last week.</i>

57:13.998 --> 57:15.764
<i>- Well, Matt, you can see.
- Look at him.</i>

57:15.766 --> 57:17.232
<i>He's got stickers and gold ink</i>

57:17.234 --> 57:19.635
<i>and gold tattoos all over him.</i>

57:19.637 --> 57:20.969
<i>- Right through Snake Run.</i>

57:20.971 --> 57:22.671
<i>I think if anyone's
crazy enough</i>

57:22.673 --> 57:24.940
<i>to get through stage one
right now, it's Neil Craver.</i>

57:24.942 --> 57:26.842
<i>- Well, he was one of
the 38 finishers</i>

57:26.844 --> 57:28.110
<i>last year on stage one...</i>

57:28.112 --> 57:30.145
- Yeah!
- Come on, Neil!

57:30.147 --> 57:31.713
<i>- But only 13 have
made it this year,</i>

57:31.715 --> 57:36.351
<i>and the Giant Log Grip's
given athletes nightmares.</i>

57:36.353 --> 57:39.488
<i>- Good urgency here, but can he
see that landing pad?</i>

57:39.490 --> 57:40.722
<i>- Nails it.
- Nice.</i>

57:40.724 --> 57:42.925
<i>Right there on that "ANW."
- Ooh!</i>

57:42.927 --> 57:44.326
<i>Wow, he almost went off
that bridge there.</i>

57:44.328 --> 57:45.761
<i>- But got to slow down
and regroup</i>

57:45.763 --> 57:48.163
<i>and stick this
on the Jumping Spider.</i>

57:48.165 --> 57:49.665
<i>- He's got to be gold here.
- Nice!</i>

57:49.667 --> 57:51.066
<i>- Locked it in.</i>

57:51.068 --> 57:53.535
<i>- There's that yoga
flexibility.</i>

57:53.537 --> 57:56.238
<i>- Crazy Craver
with a brisk pace so far</i>

57:56.240 --> 57:58.307
<i>on the first half
of this course.</i>

57:58.309 --> 58:01.109
<i>- Now the Sonic Curve.</i>

58:01.111 --> 58:03.312
<i>5'11", 160, Crazy Craver.</i>

58:03.314 --> 58:04.680
<i>Good agility. Good endurance.</i>

58:04.682 --> 58:06.381
<i>- Oh, Matt, here it is.</i>

58:06.383 --> 58:08.684
<i>He's got that gold rush
going now.</i>

58:08.686 --> 58:09.818
<i>Look at that speed!</i>

58:09.820 --> 58:11.319
<i>- And a good leap.</i>
