(country western music plays)
(engine idling)

00:25.100 --> 00:28.100
Hello. You ever hear
of this guy,

00:28.100 --> 00:29.560
Johnny Paycheck?

00:30.600 --> 00:32.430
No?

00:32.430 --> 00:34.640
You don't like
country music, do you?

00:34.640 --> 00:39.270
You think it's corny and twangy
and kind of stupid.

00:40.180 --> 00:41.640
Well, you could be right,

00:41.640 --> 00:43.930
but it's always good
to keep an open mind.

00:43.930 --> 00:47.470
You know, Johnny Paycheck here
sold over 10 million records.

00:47.470 --> 00:51.270
That's on par with people
like NWA and Gwen Stefani.

00:51.270 --> 00:53.520
In the early '90s once,
I was watching TV,

00:53.520 --> 00:56.220
and there was all this hubbub
on the news

00:56.220 --> 00:58.680
about NWA and gangsta rap

00:58.680 --> 01:00.470
and how it was
just too violent.

01:00.470 --> 01:01.640
I got tired of watching this,

01:01.640 --> 01:04.810
because I actually like NWA
and gangsta rap,

01:04.810 --> 01:06.980
so I switched over
to the Country Music Channel,

01:06.980 --> 01:09.640
where I saw Johnny Paycheck
being interviewed.
(country music plays)

01:09.640 --> 01:12.020
And he had
just gotten out of jail

01:12.020 --> 01:15.810
for shooting a guy,
like, he really shot a guy.

01:15.810 --> 01:19.680
And I thought,
"Why isn't anybody worried
about Johnny Paycheck?

01:19.680 --> 01:22.310
Why isn't Connie Chung
picking on him?"

Mike Judge:
Johnny Paycheck
was a dirt poor kid

01:36.680 --> 01:39.520
who pulled himself out
of poverty with his music,

01:39.520 --> 01:41.730
became a working-class hero,

01:41.730 --> 01:45.180
and almost killed himself
and one other person,

01:45.180 --> 01:47.770
that we know of,
in the process.

01:47.770 --> 01:50.770
And he looks a lot
like Charles Manson.

01:50.770 --> 01:53.680
(theme music playing)

02:05.770 --> 02:07.520
Mike: Greenfield, Ohio,

02:07.520 --> 02:10.180
birthplace of the detachable
horse collar,

02:10.180 --> 02:11.890
Johnny Paycheck,

02:11.890 --> 02:13.560
and these three guys,

02:13.560 --> 02:14.930
the Adams Brothers--

02:14.930 --> 02:17.520
Don, Gary, and Arnie--

02:17.520 --> 02:20.390
Paycheck's backup band
for nearly two decades.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.060
(country music playing)

02:22.060 --> 02:24.470
The first time I met
Johnny Paycheck,

02:24.470 --> 02:26.220
I was like four years old.

02:26.220 --> 02:28.100
One of my brothers
had him under a tree,

02:28.100 --> 02:29.560
kicking his butt.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.140
(guys laugh)

02:31.140 --> 02:32.560
We just hung out together,

02:32.560 --> 02:33.890
'cause we lived in the--

02:33.890 --> 02:36.100
the same neighborhood,
in the country.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.980
I remember one time
when he came to the house,

02:38.980 --> 02:40.310
he brought a guitar with him,

02:40.310 --> 02:44.520
and he sat in that kitchen
and sang and sang and sang.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.770
A couple years after that,

02:45.770 --> 02:47.890
me and Gary got in a talent show
in Greenfield,

02:47.890 --> 02:49.220
and we needed a guitar player,

02:49.220 --> 02:53.220
and so he played guitar
for us and, uh, and we lost.

02:53.220 --> 02:55.640
Gary:
Lost to a woman
that pantomimed,

02:55.640 --> 02:58.100
so that was rough to take.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.310
(guys laugh)

03:00.310 --> 03:02.470
Of course at that time,
he was Donny Lytle.

03:02.470 --> 03:03.600
(chuckles) Donny Lytle.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.310
He had several
different nicknames

03:05.310 --> 03:07.270
that a lot of people
would call him.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.430
In his youth, uh,
a lot of people

03:09.430 --> 03:11.600
referred to him as Hubcap Donny.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.680
Gary: He was a hubcap thief.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.140
Him stealing hubcaps,

03:16.140 --> 03:18.390
they forgot to mention
it had the car with it.

03:18.390 --> 03:20.560
Arnie:
Oh yeah.
(guys laugh)

03:20.560 --> 03:23.640
He had a little, uh,
criminal element to him.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.810
When he was
in Greenfield one time, uh,

03:25.810 --> 03:27.930
he went downtown
and, uh, got drunk,

03:27.930 --> 03:29.980
and he went
and broke into a car lot.

03:29.980 --> 03:32.430
Arnie: He seen the car
out there on the lot

03:32.430 --> 03:34.640
that he liked, so he went in
and found a key for it,

03:34.640 --> 03:37.350
took it for a drive
and didn't like it,

03:37.350 --> 03:40.220
so he brought it back,
went in, got another one.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.140
This time, he got
the whole key board.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.520
Don:
Stole all the keys.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.980
Arnie:
Got him another car,
took off again.

03:45.980 --> 03:47.430
(engine revs)

03:47.430 --> 03:49.060
Took it down
to Paint Creek...

03:49.060 --> 03:52.470
Don:
And took all the keys
and throwed 'em in the creek.

03:52.470 --> 03:54.020
He got in a little trouble
over that.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.890
Once he got out of jail,
he was gone.

03:56.890 --> 03:58.560
He took off for Nashville.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.810
Mike:
Down in Music City,

03:59.810 --> 04:02.390
Paycheck scraped by
as a backup musician,

04:02.390 --> 04:05.640
playing with everyone
from Porter Wagoner
to George Jones.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.310
Gary:
He was kind of like
a country music Mozart.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.430
You know,
he played guitar,
lead guitar,

04:10.430 --> 04:12.640
uh, steel, and, uh, drums.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.390
He was
an excellent bass player.

04:14.390 --> 04:17.220

04:30.020 --> 04:31.680

Next time
I'd seen him was, uh,

04:31.680 --> 04:34.850
he had come back,
and he had changed
his name to Donny Young.

04:34.850 --> 04:38.140

04:38.140 --> 04:39.350

04:39.350 --> 04:41.930

Back in them days there
was a Johnny Dollar, and a...

04:45.350 --> 04:48.730
Arnie:
Johnny Cash and,
uh, Johnny Western.

04:48.730 --> 04:52.640
Mike: Donny's manager,
figuring he'd cash in
on the Johnny trend...

04:52.640 --> 04:54.980
(bell dings)
...recalled an obscure
Polish boxer,

04:54.980 --> 04:58.020
Johnny Paychek
with a "K."

04:58.020 --> 05:01.270
Gary:
From that point on,
I mean, he totally believed

05:01.270 --> 05:02.680
he was Johnny Paycheck.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.180
You couldn't talk him out of it.
Saying, "Okay, Donny."

05:05.180 --> 05:07.850
Or every time
you'd call him Donny,
he'd get mad at you.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.140
I think he had
an identity crisis.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.930
Mike:
He legally changed
his name to Johnny Paycheck,

05:12.930 --> 05:14.390
and his career took off,

05:14.390 --> 05:18.020
but deep down inside,
he was still Hubcap Donny.

05:18.020 --> 05:21.850
Paycheck was, uh, playing
with Patsy Cline.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.810

down in Texas someplace,

and he got to drinking.

05:33.020 --> 05:34.470

(Arnie chuckles)

05:34.470 --> 05:36.890
He found her keys
and he just went out,

05:36.890 --> 05:39.060
got in her car,
and took off.

05:39.060 --> 05:40.600
(tires screech)

05:40.600 --> 05:42.140
And when he'd get
to the gate,

05:42.140 --> 05:45.180
they would shut
the gate on him.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.770
There was
only one entrance to it.

05:46.770 --> 05:48.430
They said,
"Just let him go.
He can't get out."

05:48.430 --> 05:51.890
And he went past that gate
a half a dozen times,

05:51.890 --> 05:54.270
and he just drove
around and around...

05:54.270 --> 05:56.770
(guys laughing)
...and around inside the park.

05:56.770 --> 05:58.140
(engine sputters)

05:58.140 --> 06:00.430
Arnie:
But eventually
it ran out of gas.

06:02.020 --> 06:05.680
He had a total
disregard for the law
when he was drinking.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.600
Mike:
Old habits die hard,

06:08.600 --> 06:10.930
but somehow he managed
to pick up a new one.

06:10.930 --> 06:14.640
There was, like, a couple
of 24-hour pharmacists

06:14.640 --> 06:16.730
there in Nashville,
you know what I mean.

06:16.730 --> 06:19.730
The drug of choice back then
was them Old Yellers.

06:19.730 --> 06:21.560
We'd go to the jam sessions,

06:21.560 --> 06:23.890
and Paycheck was always
up there playing bass.

06:23.890 --> 06:25.640
Well, we'd stay up
for three or four days

06:25.640 --> 06:28.470
just to get in tune,
and then jam for three
or four more.

06:28.470 --> 06:30.810
(horn honks)
Mike:
Between the speed binges

06:30.810 --> 06:32.350
and stints in jail,

06:32.350 --> 06:36.020
Paycheck found himself
broke and homeless.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.310
Then he met a man
named Swamp Dogg.

06:39.310 --> 06:42.100
(Swamp Dogg clears throat)
Umm...

06:43.810 --> 06:46.890

06:46.890 --> 06:48.640

"Don't Take Her,
She's All I Got,"

06:51.140 --> 06:52.520
single-handedly

06:52.520 --> 06:55.600
put Johnny Paycheck
on the map,

07:17.560 --> 07:19.520
People were buying
the hell out of it.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.060
We made a fortune
with that motherfucker.

07:22.060 --> 07:24.270
But, anyway, I digress.

07:24.270 --> 07:28.270
Paycheck had a way
of destroying hisself
about every five years.

07:28.270 --> 07:30.060
I mean,
you could look for it.

07:30.060 --> 07:34.060
I mean any-- he'd get up,
things would be going
pretty smooth,

07:34.060 --> 07:36.390
and then he would--
he would just totally--

07:36.390 --> 07:38.470
he was hellbent
on self destruction.
Gary: Yeah, he did.

07:38.470 --> 07:40.180
He had a five-year cycle.

07:40.180 --> 07:41.850
Yeah, he had
about four of those.
Gary: Yeah.

07:41.850 --> 07:44.220
Yeah, and was
clean-cut, you know,

07:44.220 --> 07:45.930
and then
"Don't Take Her,
She's All I Got,"

07:45.930 --> 07:49.310
and he just as tame as--
doing everything like
a businessman,

07:49.310 --> 07:51.180
and then all of a sudden,
he put that hat on,

07:51.180 --> 07:54.730
and I thought, "Okay,
the five years is up.
I'm going home."

07:54.730 --> 07:56.020
(laughs)

07:56.020 --> 07:58.270
(yelling)
Gary:
We was in Canada,

07:58.270 --> 08:01.390
and Paycheck got drunk
and rowdy in the hotel there.

08:01.390 --> 08:02.640
(thuds)
(police sirens wail)

08:02.640 --> 08:05.060
So, the hotel people
called the police on him,

08:05.060 --> 08:07.850
and they come down
and they hauled him off.

08:07.850 --> 08:11.600
Anyhow, we went down
to get him out the next morning
and had to pay the fine.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.470
Paycheck didn't
even have a shirt on,

08:13.470 --> 08:15.100
had to go to court
without a shirt.

Paycheck went,
"Fuck the queen."

08:25.470 --> 08:27.930
(guys laugh)

08:27.930 --> 08:30.270
I think Johnny Paycheck
was the real deal

08:30.270 --> 08:33.520
when it came down
to being a gangster,

08:33.520 --> 08:36.060
to being a thug,
and he could've...

08:36.060 --> 08:40.140
he could've been a Crip...
(laughs) very easily.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.890
We just did things
the way we wanted to,

08:42.890 --> 08:44.810
and, uh,
somebody didn't like it,

08:44.810 --> 08:46.350
we'd tell 'em
where to kiss it.

08:46.350 --> 08:48.850
Johnny...
didn't take no shit.

08:48.850 --> 08:51.100
Mike:
In October of 1976,

08:51.100 --> 08:53.060
Johnny released
what many considered to be

08:53.060 --> 08:55.560
the quintessential
outlaw country record,

08:55.560 --> 08:57.930
11 Months and 29 Days.

08:57.930 --> 08:59.560
This was a reference
to the length

08:59.560 --> 09:02.520
of his latest stint in prison
for check fraud.

09:02.520 --> 09:05.180
This charge earned him
a new nickname:

09:05.180 --> 09:07.060
Johnny Bad Check.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.980
A psychiatrist might
be able to figure out

09:08.980 --> 09:11.060
what caused
all Paycheck's troubles,

09:11.060 --> 09:12.930
but his friends have
their own theory.

09:12.930 --> 09:15.180
Paycheck was
a little feller.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.850
He was intimidated
by anybody over four feet tall.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.930
He had that little man complex.

09:20.930 --> 09:24.060
I guess he would have
a Napoleon complex,

09:24.060 --> 09:26.640
'cause he was short.
Hadn't been for that hat,

09:26.640 --> 09:28.680
he really would
have been short.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.600
Mike:
Paycheck's longtime manager,
Ernie Stepp,

09:31.600 --> 09:34.310
had to stick up for Johnny
on more than one occasion.

09:34.310 --> 09:37.640
If I'm working for you,
and if it's any way possible

09:37.640 --> 09:39.430
without killing somebody...

09:41.100 --> 09:42.810
I'll do it.

09:42.810 --> 09:45.100
One time,
we was coming out
of California,

09:45.100 --> 09:48.180
and, uh, John wanted
a-- a Big Mac.

09:48.180 --> 09:49.350
That's what he was wanting.

09:49.350 --> 09:51.770
He was coming down off
of drinking a little bit.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.390
I told the bus driver--

09:53.390 --> 09:55.600
I said, "John wants
a double-decker hamburger."

09:55.600 --> 09:58.220
Anyway, he stopped
at a truck stop,

09:58.220 --> 10:00.390
and that's where
we were gonna eat.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.520
I said, "No, uh,
John wants a--

10:02.520 --> 10:05.600
a different kind of sandwich,
a double triple hamburger."

10:05.600 --> 10:08.060
He said, no,
he's driving the fucking bus,

10:08.060 --> 10:10.020
we'll stop where he wants.

10:10.020 --> 10:14.680
John, he didn't come
out of the back of the bus
for food, cops, or nobody.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.520
Anyway, I shot
the bus driver in the ear.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.680
(gunshot)

10:18.680 --> 10:20.180
First I hit him
upside the head.

10:20.180 --> 10:23.680
I got him down on the--
on that front seat.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.100
Yes, they're easier to shoot
when you get 'em down.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.520
(laughs)
Yeah, if you--
if you don't get

10:28.520 --> 10:31.060
the right kind of sandwich
for me, I'll shoot you.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.520
(laughs)

10:32.520 --> 10:34.060
Mike:
Ernie not only made sure

10:34.060 --> 10:36.390
Paycheck got
his double triple hamburgers

10:36.390 --> 10:38.890
and kept his
bus driver in line,

10:38.890 --> 10:42.060
he also guided him
to the biggest moment
of his career.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.730
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome, please,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.890
the fabulous
Johnny Paycheck!

10:45.890 --> 10:48.520
♪ Take this job and shove it ♪

10:48.520 --> 10:52.600
♪ I ain't working here
no more ♪

10:52.600 --> 10:55.770
That was a classic.
That's his signature song.

10:55.770 --> 10:59.560
It went to number one,
and the unemployment rate
skyrocketed.

10:59.560 --> 11:03.270
♪ You better not try
to stand in my way
as I'm walking ♪

11:03.270 --> 11:05.140
It was-- All of a sudden,
that's all you heard.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.890
It was like "Jingle Bells."

11:06.890 --> 11:09.430
♪ Take this job and shove it ♪

11:12.180 --> 11:13.680
(cheers, applause)

11:13.680 --> 11:16.770
It was the battle cry
of all the working people.

11:16.770 --> 11:19.220
John become
the working-class hero

11:19.220 --> 11:21.060
because that was
their slogan.

11:21.060 --> 11:23.390
The governor of West Virginia
decided to bring

11:23.390 --> 11:27.600
Johnny Paycheck in
to support the miners.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.930
Tom Brokaw:
It is blood that has made
Harlan County famous,

11:29.930 --> 11:33.930
blood spilled in some of the
most violent labor disputes
in this country's history.

11:33.930 --> 11:35.810
Newswoman:
People in these mountains
have guns,

11:35.810 --> 11:38.680
and violence on a picket line
is not unusual.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.140
As the strike dragged on
for more than a year,

11:41.140 --> 11:43.770
two miners were shot,
one man was killed.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.220
So they brought in, basically,

11:45.220 --> 11:46.600
an army of state troopers,

11:46.600 --> 11:49.020
and the state troopers lined up
and put a wall between 'em.

11:49.020 --> 11:50.600
And they said,
"If you come across the line,

11:50.600 --> 11:52.640
"we're arresting all of you,
and you're all going to jail,

11:52.640 --> 11:55.220
or we'll shoot it out with you."
And it was really tense.

11:55.220 --> 11:57.850
And all of a sudden,
right out in the middle
of the road,

11:57.850 --> 12:00.390
Paycheck walking out there
with a guitar, and he goes...

12:00.390 --> 12:02.430
♪ Take this job and shove it ♪

12:02.430 --> 12:05.140
(cheering)
Dub: And this crowd
just explode--

12:05.140 --> 12:07.640
I mean, the coal miners
just go insane.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.680
He was their hero.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.310
John spoke what
they couldn't speak.

12:14.310 --> 12:17.350
He was the reason why
they got the contract signed

12:17.350 --> 12:19.140
and the scabbers went home.

12:19.140 --> 12:22.810
That was the only time
I ever seen Paycheck cry.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.310
(cries)

12:25.310 --> 12:26.810
Damn.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.350
(chuckles)

12:29.810 --> 12:31.350
Mike:
For Johnny, the success

12:31.350 --> 12:33.020
of "Take This Job
and Shove It"

12:33.020 --> 12:36.020
had its highs...
and its highs.

12:36.020 --> 12:40.680
And the next thing I knew,
he was just a total cokehead.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.890
He was sucking a lot
of powder, a lot of it.

12:43.890 --> 12:47.390
We were driving down
the road in-- in the bus,

12:47.390 --> 12:50.100
and he'd run out
of cocaine.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.930
So he gets on the radio.

12:51.930 --> 12:55.520
He said, "Hey, out there,
breaker, breaker."  (laughs)

12:55.520 --> 12:58.020
He says,
"This is Johnny Paycheck.

12:58.020 --> 13:01.430
I want some cocaine
and don't care what it costs."

13:01.430 --> 13:03.600
(laughs)
(truck honks)

13:03.600 --> 13:06.680
So, here are
a couple of truckers,

13:06.680 --> 13:08.350
we're going down
the roads a way,

13:08.350 --> 13:11.060
and they were going
into a rest area.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.560
Gary:
These guys brought it back
and handed it to him,

13:13.560 --> 13:15.140
and they said,
"Here's your cocaine, man."

13:15.140 --> 13:17.980
The cocaine they had,
I wouldn't give it to a dog.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.350
Gary:
He said...
(sniffs)

13:19.350 --> 13:20.600
..."Boy, that's
some good stuff."

13:20.600 --> 13:22.470
(guys laugh)

13:22.470 --> 13:25.560
And he spent--
I know for a fact--

13:25.560 --> 13:29.060
$16 million up his nose.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.640
(sniffing)
He'd just set there.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.640
There's nothing worse
than a hillbilly

13:33.640 --> 13:36.890
with a hit record.
(guys laugh)

13:36.890 --> 13:39.060
I was with him
one time when he said,

13:39.060 --> 13:41.560
"Don, let's rent a Learjet."
(engine shrieks)

13:41.560 --> 13:45.980
Don: And we flew
80 mile on the other side
of the job we was going to

13:45.980 --> 13:48.390
and had to catch cabs back
to where we was going.

13:48.390 --> 13:50.390
(guys laugh)

13:50.390 --> 13:54.180
He couldn't handle success,
if you really wanna know
the truth.

13:54.180 --> 13:55.850
Every time he was ready
to make it big,

13:55.850 --> 14:00.180
he would screw up.
He walked into, uh,
a meeting in LA

14:00.180 --> 14:02.430
with the-- the heads
of Epic Records,

14:02.430 --> 14:05.220
and, uh,
I guess Paycheck got upset

14:05.220 --> 14:07.180
because they wasn't putting
enough money behind him

14:07.180 --> 14:08.810
or something
like that, but he--

14:08.810 --> 14:10.470
he just busted
in the door.

14:10.470 --> 14:12.350
"I'm a star.
I'm a giant star."

14:12.350 --> 14:15.520
"Bigger than Elvis."
"I'm bigger
than country music itself."

14:15.520 --> 14:17.730
Mike:
Johnny's friends
are quick to note

14:17.730 --> 14:22.060
that some parts
of Paycheck were not bigger
than country music.

14:22.060 --> 14:24.220
He did like--
like to be naked,

14:24.220 --> 14:27.020
and why--
if you'd see him,
you'd wonder why.

14:27.020 --> 14:30.220
So small,
he should have been
ashamed of hisself.

14:30.220 --> 14:33.890
I never heard
anything about his...
teeny-weeny peenie,

14:33.890 --> 14:37.180
because I don't want 'em talking
about my teeny-weeny peenie,

14:37.180 --> 14:40.140
(laughs)
so I said shit. Uh...

14:40.140 --> 14:44.430
Mike: Clearly,
Paycheck needed something
to make him feel like a man.

14:44.430 --> 14:47.310
He grew ten feet
when he was, uh...

14:47.310 --> 14:48.730
riding with the Hells Angels.

14:48.730 --> 14:51.100
(motorcycles revving)
Ernie:
Hell, the Hells Angels

14:51.100 --> 14:54.140
took care of Johnny
like he was a baby.

14:54.140 --> 14:56.930
They made sure
he never got hurt,

14:56.930 --> 14:58.430
and they took care
of that boy.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.310
Uh, you know, he liked
to play the role,

15:00.310 --> 15:02.470
like ride a big,
bad motorcycle.

15:02.470 --> 15:05.980
He got to be the badass
that he dreamed that he was.

15:05.980 --> 15:08.810
We played
at the Cow Palace
in San Francisco,

15:08.810 --> 15:11.220
and Willie was on the show,
and the Hells Angels was
all up there,

15:11.220 --> 15:14.020
and he said, "Don, hey,

15:14.020 --> 15:16.310
I think I'm gonna be a hitman
for the Hells Angels."

15:16.310 --> 15:20.060
I said, "You set your sights
pretty high, buddy."

15:20.060 --> 15:22.350
(guys laugh)

15:22.350 --> 15:25.020
And here's the story
that goes with that.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.640
In Oakland, California,
federal and local police

15:27.640 --> 15:31.730
tried to round up members
of the Hells Angels
motorcycle gang.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.350
Mike: Late in 1985,

15:33.350 --> 15:34.680
after wrapping up
a tour,
(sniffs)

15:34.680 --> 15:36.520
Johnny Paycheck
kept the party going

15:36.520 --> 15:39.350
at a Hells Angels clubhouse
in Maryland.

15:39.350 --> 15:41.850
It happened to be
under FBI surveillance.

15:41.850 --> 15:45.600
Agents allegedly
warned the bikers
about a credible threat

15:45.600 --> 15:48.350
by a rival gang
to blow the place up.

15:48.350 --> 15:52.220
Upon hearing the news,
Paycheck summoned all
the courage he had,

15:52.220 --> 15:57.180
ran into the clubhouse
and grabbed a stash
of Peruvian cocaine.

15:57.180 --> 15:59.560
He headed back home
to Greenfield,

15:59.560 --> 16:05.470
high out of his mind,
with two suitcases full
of money and said cocaine.

16:05.470 --> 16:09.560
Gary: And he was
looking for my cousin
Red Dog's daughter, Niecey,

16:09.560 --> 16:12.180
my niece,
who was 14 years old.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.810
And I said,
"They call her Niecey."

16:13.810 --> 16:16.730
I said, "Here in Greenfield,
we call that statutory rape."

16:16.730 --> 16:19.180
(guys laugh)
Gary:
For some reason or other,

16:19.180 --> 16:21.730
he had thought
that I'd been sleeping
with Niecey,

16:21.730 --> 16:23.930
who was just like
a daughter to me.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.220
I said,
"No, that's bullshit."

16:26.220 --> 16:28.680
Somebody told me
he was coming over
to shoot me.

16:28.680 --> 16:33.060
Mike: Attorney Rocky Coss
has a slightly different
version of the events.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.060
(clears throat) Johnny claimed
the purpose of the visit

16:36.060 --> 16:38.850
was to come see his mother
before Christmas.

16:38.850 --> 16:41.810
He then decided to come look
for a place to get a drink.

16:41.810 --> 16:45.310
And so he drove down 72
down into Hillsboro,

16:45.310 --> 16:48.600
and the first bar that
he came to that was open

16:48.600 --> 16:51.140
was the North High Lounge.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.140
So he come in there
and he was talking

16:53.140 --> 16:57.350
to a couple of old boys that--
we all used to grow up together.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.220
Rocky:
Lloyd and Larry had both
been drinking that evening

17:00.220 --> 17:02.600
and had several beers,
maybe as many as eight.

17:03.930 --> 17:05.980
And you know,
they were certainly loose,

17:05.980 --> 17:08.600
you know, as many people
are that are drinking.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.810
Bowers wanted to meet him,
so he went up

17:10.810 --> 17:13.270
and initiated the contact
with Paycheck at the bar.

17:13.270 --> 17:16.060
Gary: "Hey, buddy,
come here and let me buy you
a drink" and all that stuff.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.980
They was as friendly
as they could possibly be.

17:18.980 --> 17:21.310
Well, they didn't know
he was just totally...

17:21.310 --> 17:24.850
(sniffing)
...totally gone
on his cocaine.

17:24.850 --> 17:26.890
Paycheck's version
of the events

17:26.890 --> 17:30.560
was that Larry and Lloyd
were basically crowding him

17:30.560 --> 17:33.560
and that Larry had
a bottle in his hand.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.390
He took that
as being a prelude

17:36.390 --> 17:39.810
to Wise attacking him
with the bottle.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.640
Mike:
Attorney Ralph Buss,
lawyer for the Hells Angels,

17:42.640 --> 17:46.980
Johnny Paycheck,
and owner and operator
of his own karate studio.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.730
Johnny was especially afraid

17:48.730 --> 17:50.470
of broken bottles.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.140
He had a tremendous acuity

17:52.140 --> 17:53.640
of imminent danger.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.560
Yeah, during that process
is when the hat exchange
took place.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.520
Johnny was wearing
his Johnny Paycheck tour hat.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.930
Bowers had a--
I believe, a camouflage hat.

18:02.930 --> 18:05.680
Larry Wise is wearing
a Jack Daniel's hat.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.350
In Highland County,
I mean, people--

18:07.350 --> 18:09.060
lots and lots
of people wear hats.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.020
You know,
I wear hats quite often.

18:11.020 --> 18:13.100
Lloyd indicated
that he liked Johnny's hat,

18:13.100 --> 18:17.310
talked to Johnny about it,
and ended up they
exchanged hats.

18:17.310 --> 18:20.730
It appeared to be a fair
and clean exchange of hats.

18:20.730 --> 18:25.350
I remember the hat was
a big, big deal to him
and definitely a threat.

18:25.350 --> 18:29.100
Then shortly after that--
Wise, uh, was a part-time
taxidermist,

18:29.100 --> 18:32.390
and he said he had
a great turtle soup recipe

18:32.390 --> 18:35.430
and you know,
he suggested
that Johnny might,

18:35.430 --> 18:38.060
you know, enjoy having
a meal cooked by Larry.

18:38.060 --> 18:41.600
Well, it-- really,
Paycheck was kind
of hungry and--

18:41.600 --> 18:45.850
and Lloyd had said,
"We got some turtle soup
out in the-- out in the truck."

18:45.850 --> 18:50.100
I heard that they had
a little disagreement
on how you make it.

18:51.060 --> 18:52.850
Not, uh, "Was it there?"

18:52.850 --> 18:54.680
Or "Who had it?"
That's what I heard.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.890
Rocky:
Paycheck made the comment
that well, you know,

18:56.890 --> 18:59.680
made him sound like, "I--
they thought I was some kind
of a hick."

18:59.680 --> 19:01.520
Gary:
That kind
of insulted Paycheck.

19:01.520 --> 19:05.060
Like, I don't know why
that would insult him,
but it did.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.560
It was not intended
as an insult.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.100
It was intended
to be friendly

19:08.100 --> 19:10.180
and offer hospitality,
a unique dish.

19:10.180 --> 19:14.470
All right now, I gotta
tell you, you gotta go out
and catch this turtle.

19:14.470 --> 19:16.350
And you cut him
out of the shell.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.180
Now, he must still be alive,

19:18.180 --> 19:21.640
but if he don't,
you cut his head off,
take his guts out.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.600
He's still got skin
on his tail,

19:23.600 --> 19:26.850
because that's how they
have sex. A male turtle--
With their tail?

19:26.850 --> 19:28.560
Yeah.
I didn't know that.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.640
A male turtle has got
a dick in his tail,

19:32.640 --> 19:36.470
and the female turtle has got
a pussy in her tail.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.930
And he gets up--
Seem like you know
an awful lot about turtles.

19:38.930 --> 19:41.140
(both laugh)
Oh listen, I'm--
Here, I have fucked

19:41.140 --> 19:44.220
every kind of animal,
woman there is

19:44.220 --> 19:47.020
but a turtle, and I tried.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.890
I never had turtle soup,
but Johnny apparently
considers this

19:50.890 --> 19:53.560
to be the third
and final insult
and erupts.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.430
(cocks)
Gun is fired.

19:55.430 --> 19:58.430
It hit Larry Wise
right in the forehead.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.430
Thankfully,
he was hardheaded

20:00.430 --> 20:03.100
and kind of went around it
and it came out the scalp,

20:03.100 --> 20:04.770
and it goes through the hat.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.930
The hat flips off
onto the floor,

20:06.930 --> 20:08.930
and he started bleeding.

20:08.930 --> 20:11.930
Gary:
It just barely went
under his scalp,

20:11.930 --> 20:14.270
you know,
wasn't nothing serious.

20:14.270 --> 20:19.310
Wise, fearing for his life,
runs out the door.

20:19.310 --> 20:20.980
According to one
of the witnesses,

20:20.980 --> 20:23.180
he was booking it
down South High Street.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.470
Johnny, for reasons
that no one knows,

20:26.470 --> 20:29.060
scoops up Larry's hat,
the Jack Daniel's hat,

20:29.060 --> 20:32.430
runs out the door
with the gun, yells at Larry:

20:32.430 --> 20:35.140
"Come back, Larry!"
Said, "I won't shoot you
no more."

20:35.140 --> 20:37.520
(guys laugh)

20:37.520 --> 20:40.470
Rocky:
Johnny gets in his car
and takes off.

20:40.470 --> 20:41.520
♪ ♪

20:41.520 --> 20:43.140
During that time,
he looked over

20:43.140 --> 20:46.180
and he saw the gun,
he threw it out the window.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.430
Drives back
to Larry Adams' house.

20:49.430 --> 20:53.560
Well, the hat is found
when the police search his car

20:53.560 --> 20:55.520
with an incriminating
bullet hole in it...

20:55.520 --> 20:57.770
(dings)
...sitting there on the seat.

20:57.770 --> 21:00.600
Paycheck claimed
he didn't know how
it got there.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.350
(police siren blares)
And the police went in...

21:02.350 --> 21:04.850
(handcuffs click)
...and made the arrest.

21:04.850 --> 21:07.600
Mike:
Paycheck needed money fast.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.470
Through his buddies
in the Hells Angels,

21:09.470 --> 21:13.520
he contacted Ralph Buss
to raise the $50,000 bail.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.060
I personally called
Johnny Cash...

21:16.060 --> 21:19.850
(rings)
...and he answered the phone
as "House of Cash."

21:19.850 --> 21:24.140
And I said, "Mr. Cash,
I represent Johnny Paycheck."

21:24.140 --> 21:27.060
He says,
"'The House of Cash'
is a misnomer."

21:27.060 --> 21:28.140
(clangs)

21:28.140 --> 21:30.850
Then we contacted
Jerry Lee Lewis,

21:30.850 --> 21:35.060
who actually did
a fundraiser for Paycheck.

21:35.060 --> 21:40.310
We got a check ultimately
for $1,400. (laughs)

21:40.310 --> 21:42.220
Mike:
Somehow between
Merle Haggard

21:42.220 --> 21:44.180
and some of his other
Nashville cronies,

21:44.180 --> 21:45.810
Paycheck made bail

21:45.810 --> 21:48.140
and was finally released
from county jail.
(jail door clanks)

21:48.140 --> 21:50.470
On New Year's Eve,
there's a party going on

21:50.470 --> 21:54.060
at the Sunnyside Bar,
which is about five,
six miles west of Hillsboro.

21:54.060 --> 21:56.680
(people chattering)
There's about 200 people
in this bar.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.390
Paycheck shows up there.

21:58.390 --> 21:59.850
He walked in there,

21:59.850 --> 22:03.100
and he had a T-shirt on
that said "Kill 'Em All."

22:04.730 --> 22:08.060
Gary: As he's
coming up on stage there
and putting the guitar on,

22:08.060 --> 22:10.100
some smart aleck
out there in the crowd

22:10.100 --> 22:13.060
went and busted
one of the balloons.
(pops)

22:13.060 --> 22:14.680
(people scream)
(clattering)

22:14.680 --> 22:17.730
Gary:
Two hundred people dove
under the tables.

22:17.730 --> 22:19.680
And somebody asked him,
said, "John,

22:19.680 --> 22:22.430
why did you shoot that guy
in Hillsboro last week?"

22:22.430 --> 22:25.140
He said, "'Cause the son
of a bitch had it coming!
That's why!"

22:25.140 --> 22:27.890
(guys laugh)

22:27.890 --> 22:29.850
And every one
of those people
that heard that

22:29.850 --> 22:32.270
showed up in court
and testified against him.

22:32.270 --> 22:33.770
The trial was like
a three-ring circus.

22:33.770 --> 22:37.520
There was a TV camera.
There was a photographer.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.980
(camera clicks)
There are reporters

22:38.980 --> 22:41.140
from newspapers
from all over Ohio.

22:41.140 --> 22:43.930
And amid all that there were
some groupies, you know,

22:43.930 --> 22:45.270
you wouldn't
describe 'em as hot

22:45.270 --> 22:47.600
except that the weather
was warm.
(rimshot)

22:47.600 --> 22:49.810
The judge presiding
had one arm.

22:49.810 --> 22:52.890
He had lost his left arm
in a farm accident.

22:52.890 --> 22:54.680
(grinds)
(thuds)

22:54.680 --> 22:59.470
The judge also had a tendency
sometimes to get headaches.
He was sensitive to light.

22:59.470 --> 23:04.640
Uh, he was very--
very concerned about sunlight
coming into the courtroom.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.680
So he would quite often
on the bench wear sunglasses.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.470
Two pairs of sunglasses.

23:10.470 --> 23:13.140
Rocky:
Either prescription,
or he'd have a clip-on,

23:13.140 --> 23:15.520
and sometimes
he'd put on both of them.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.680
Well, Johnny Paycheck
walked into the courtroom.

23:17.680 --> 23:22.310
He really didn't make
any effort to try to clean
himself up for the trial.

23:22.310 --> 23:24.310
Ralph:
His clothes didn't look good.

23:24.310 --> 23:25.640
His hair was long,

23:25.640 --> 23:28.470
and I would
describe it as scraggly.
He had a beard.

23:28.470 --> 23:32.520
And it was much,
much too large.
It wasn't trimmed.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.810
He looked dangerous
or close to psychotic.

23:35.810 --> 23:39.850
He had a curious resemblance
almost to Charles Manson.

23:39.850 --> 23:41.520
I went to court with him,

23:41.520 --> 23:43.520
and, uh, you know,
they went through--

23:43.520 --> 23:46.020
the prosecution went through
their little thing there.

23:46.020 --> 23:48.520
And then we had--
we took off like
an hour for lunch.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.390
Well, me and him just went
across the street there...
(barking)

23:51.390 --> 23:54.470
...at a bar and set there
and got about half drunk.

23:54.470 --> 23:58.220
Come back in, and he said,
"You wait till my attorney
gets him."

23:58.220 --> 24:00.350
He literally believed

24:00.350 --> 24:02.520
that there was
gonna be 3,000 Hells Angels

24:02.520 --> 24:04.890
come riding over the hill
and rescue him.

24:04.890 --> 24:07.350
They was gonna bust him
out of the trial there

24:07.350 --> 24:10.680
on their motorcycles and ride
off into the sunset with him.

24:10.680 --> 24:15.180
(laughs)
So, Ralph Buss calls Johnny
to testify at his own trial.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.430
He felt that this would be
one of those cases

24:17.430 --> 24:20.470
where testifying was
a good move. It was not.

24:20.470 --> 24:21.600
He was so high.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.430
Rocky:
Well, during
the cross-examination,

24:23.430 --> 24:27.600
he was trying to portray
himself as a peaceful,
nonviolent person,

24:27.600 --> 24:30.890
and yet he had an album
and a song called

24:30.890 --> 24:33.060
Armed and Crazy.

24:33.060 --> 24:36.220
Mike:
This fact, combined
with Johnny's unusual behavior

24:36.220 --> 24:37.730
and appearance
in the courtroom

24:37.730 --> 24:40.180
had a not-so-surprising
effect on the jury.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.640
Things got progressively worse.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.060
Johnny's on the witness stand,

24:45.060 --> 24:49.390
and for some reason
he picks up this large gun

24:49.390 --> 24:52.560
that's laying there,
and he raises it
above his head.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.020
Rocky: And he does
this whirling thing
with the gun.

24:56.310 --> 24:59.600
When that happened,
Ralph just went pale.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.810
It was all over. The end.

25:01.810 --> 25:03.600
(jail door clangs shut)

25:03.600 --> 25:06.430
My heart sank,
and I visualized him

25:06.430 --> 25:10.430
already wearing the handcuffs,
schlepping down the hall.

25:11.470 --> 25:13.930
About, um,
two and a half hours later,

25:13.930 --> 25:15.930
Johnny Paycheck's
found guilty,

25:15.930 --> 25:19.930
and he is sentenced to seven
to nine and a half years
in Ohio State Prison.

25:19.930 --> 25:22.890
Gary: So the judge said,
"Okay, that'll be seven years"

25:22.890 --> 25:25.060
or whatever it was,
and as they're leading John off,

25:25.060 --> 25:27.100
and he said, "I'll be out
in two weeks!"

25:27.100 --> 25:29.310
(guys laugh)

25:29.310 --> 25:32.730
And he went directly
from the courtroom to jail.

25:32.730 --> 25:34.770
(clangs)

25:34.770 --> 25:37.270
Gary: When he was
in the Chillicothe prison
down there,

25:37.270 --> 25:39.770
he somehow or another
got Merle Haggard

25:39.770 --> 25:42.520
to promise to come up
and do a concert.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.310
They've asked me
to come out here and introduce

25:44.310 --> 25:47.180
this gentleman I've known
for about 25 years.

25:47.180 --> 25:50.640
I've been doing time
with him on the streets.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.930
(cheering)

25:54.810 --> 25:57.310
He said going to prison
was the best thing

25:57.310 --> 25:59.730
that ever happened to him.
He said, "That saved my life."
