0600 hours.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.212
Regeneration cycle complete.

00:17.283 --> 00:23.984
Daily Log, Seven of Nine,
Stardate 15781. 2.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.991
Today Ensign Kim and l

00:26.092 --> 00:27.855
will conduct
a comprehensive diagnostic

00:27.927 --> 00:29.656
of the aft sensor array.

00:29.729 --> 00:33.130
l have allocated three hours,
20 minutes for the task

00:33.199 --> 00:34.666
and an additional 17 minutes

00:34.734 --> 00:38.033
for Ensign Kim's usual
conversational digressions.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.833
l am scheduled to take

00:39.906 --> 00:41.806
a nutritional supplement
at 1500 hours,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.605
engage in one hour
of cardiovascular activity,

00:44.677 --> 00:47.043
then l intend to review a text
the Doctor recommended

00:47.113 --> 00:49.013
entitled A Christmas Carol.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.744
He believes it will have
educational value.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.115
End log.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.121
l'll get this.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.719
Don't give me
any hints.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.027
l have no intention
of doing so.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.124
Ensign.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.168
Hi, Seven.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.634
Are you ready to begin

01:10.703 --> 01:12.170
our sensor diagnostic?

01:12.238 --> 01:13.762
ls it 0600 already?

01:13.840 --> 01:15.933
We've been playing
all night.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.636
Vulcan kal- toh.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.735
For a game of logic,

01:19.813 --> 01:21.747
you'd be surprised at
how addictive it is.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.976
Give me a few more minutes
to figure this out.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.847
You should attend
to your duties, Ensign.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.045
l'll accept your forfeit.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.987
No way.

01:30.056 --> 01:32.286
This is the closest
l've ever come to beating you

01:32.358 --> 01:34.258
and l'm not giving up now.

01:41.367 --> 01:42.356
Ahh...

01:46.639 --> 01:48.664
lmpressive.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.675
Elementary
spatial harmonics.

01:50.743 --> 01:52.176
Are you ready now?

01:52.245 --> 01:54.406
Yeah. Sure.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.023
l would have
gotten that.

02:08.228 --> 02:10.526
ls there anything
you don't know?

02:10.597 --> 02:11.928
l was Borg.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.465
"l was Borg."

02:13.533 --> 02:14.522
That's what you always say.

02:14.601 --> 02:15.568
But what does it mean?

02:15.635 --> 02:17.933
You have the knowledge
of 10, 000 species in your head?

02:18.037 --> 02:19.868
Not exactly.

02:19.939 --> 02:20.928
Each drone's experiences

02:21.007 --> 02:22.907
are processed by
the collective.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.876
Only useful information
is retained.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.275
Still, that
probably makes you

02:26.346 --> 02:28.177
the most intelligent
human being alive.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.806
Probably.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.475
So what do you need
the rest of us for?

02:33.319 --> 02:34.479
Forget l asked.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.453
What was that?

02:37.524 --> 02:39.219
We just dropped out of warp.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.953
What's the problem?

02:41.027 --> 02:42.892
We were hit
by some kind of shock wave.

02:42.962 --> 02:43.951
Source?

02:44.030 --> 02:45.258
Checking.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.923
Hold on.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.127
l just lost
all my sensor readings.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.966
The computer is bringing up
some kind of message,

02:52.038 --> 02:53.300
but l can't access it.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.170
You better take a look at this.

02:55.241 --> 02:56.401
l can see it.

02:56.476 --> 02:57.704
What is it?

02:57.777 --> 02:59.972
l have no idea.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.105
My command codes aren't working.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.083
The computer says
l have insufficient clearance

03:05.151 --> 03:06.413
to access the message.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.089
We can't function like this.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.386
l'm going to get Harry up here
to trace the source.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.892
Don't do anything.
l'll take care of this.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.692
Send all sensor data
about the particle wave

03:23.770 --> 03:24.759
to my ready room.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.533
Tom, disengage engines
and hold position here.

03:27.607 --> 03:28.733
Captain...

03:28.808 --> 03:29.797
what's going on?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.535
l can't explain right now.

03:33.613 --> 03:36.207
Don't discuss any of this
with the rest of the crew.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.648
l'll have further instructions
for you soon.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.535
Computer, seal the doors
to this room.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.536
No entry
without my authorization.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.572
Doors are sealed.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.907
Access secured data file:
Omega one.

05:45.978 --> 05:48.276
Voiceprint confirmed.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.815
State clearance code.

05:49.882 --> 05:55.149
Janeway- one- one- five- three- red,
clearance level 10.

05:55.221 --> 05:56.916
Confirmed.

05:56.989 --> 05:59.856
Sensors have detected
the Omega phenomenon

05:59.926 --> 06:03.089
within 1. 2 light- years
of this vessel.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.632
lmplement the Omega Directive
immediately.

06:06.666 --> 06:09.533
All other priorities
have been rescinded.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.301
Display sensor data.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.174
l've been informed this is
a highly classified mission.

06:23.249 --> 06:26.150
lnformation will be provided
on a need- to- know basis--

06:26.219 --> 06:27.151
Captain's orders.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.085
Classified? By who?

06:29.155 --> 06:31.214
We're 60, 000 light- years
from Starfleet.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.917
Like l said,
need- to- know.

06:32.992 --> 06:34.186
B'Elanna, she wants
you to install

06:34.260 --> 06:36.660
multiphasic shielding
around the warp core.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.163
l've never seen
this shield configuration.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.928
l'd like to run a couple
of computer simulations

06:42.068 --> 06:43.535
- to make sure it's stable.
- No time.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.571
She needs this
done by 1 100 hours.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.299
1 100? l don't think
that's possible.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.431
Make it possible.

06:48.508 --> 06:49.907
Are we attempting
to protect

06:49.976 --> 06:52.240
the core from some form
of subspace radiation?

06:52.311 --> 06:53.243
l don't know
any more than you do.

06:53.312 --> 06:54.108
lt will be difficult

06:54.180 --> 06:55.977
to complete the task,
without more data.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.640
The data you've got
will have to do.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.582
Tom, start modifying
a shuttlecraft

06:59.652 --> 07:00.676
to withstand extreme

07:00.787 --> 07:03.483
thermal stress--
12, 000 Kelvins at least.

07:03.523 --> 07:04.455
Aye, sir.

07:04.524 --> 07:05.786
Does all this have
anything to do

07:05.858 --> 07:07.951
with that secret message
that the Captain received?

07:08.027 --> 07:09.085
What have
you heard?

07:09.162 --> 07:10.459
Rumors, mostly.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.020
Janeway's been locked
in her ready room

07:12.098 --> 07:13.793
for the last 16 hours...

07:13.866 --> 07:16.858
something about
an Omega Directive.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.096
Omega?

07:18.171 --> 07:19.138
Ring a bell?

07:19.205 --> 07:21.639
Look, the speculation
ends right here.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.641
Now, l expect you
to carry out your assignments

07:23.709 --> 07:25.472
with a minimum of gossip,
understood?

07:25.545 --> 07:26.876
l know it's hard
not to wonder.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.436
Frankly, l'm
curious myself,

07:28.514 --> 07:30.744
but the Captain was
very adamant about this.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.546
Get going.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.449
The Captain
wants to see you.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.578
l thought she might.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.433
Come in.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.665
What do you know about
the Omega Directive?

07:55.741 --> 07:57.231
Everything you do,
most likely.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.579
l thought as much.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.274
The Borg assimilated
Starfleet Captains.

08:03.349 --> 08:06.250
You would possess
all of their knowledge.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.616
That's correct.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.212
Do you intend
to carry out the Directive?

08:10.289 --> 08:11.517
Yes.

08:11.591 --> 08:14.754
Then sensors have detected
the molecule.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.853
So it would appear,
but we have to confirm it.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.090
"We"?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.326
You're going to help me
carry out the Directive.

08:22.568 --> 08:23.728
Protocol forbids me

08:23.803 --> 08:26.363
from discussing this mission
with any of my crew,

08:26.439 --> 08:28.907
but since you
already know about it,

08:29.008 --> 08:31.408
my choice is
to either work with you

08:31.477 --> 08:34.412
or...confine you
to quarters.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.812
Perhaps you should
do the latter.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.181
l will not help
you destroy Omega.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.879
lt should be harnessed.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.078
That's impossible.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.621
The Borg believe
otherwise.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.384
Explain.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.187
On one occasion,
we were able

08:47.260 --> 08:49.490
to create a single
Omega molecule.

08:49.562 --> 08:50.756
We kept it stable

08:50.830 --> 08:52.695
for one- trillionth
of a nanosecond

08:52.765 --> 08:54.096
before it destabilized.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.566
We didn't have enough
boronite ore left

08:56.636 --> 08:59.196
to synthesize more, but
the knowledge we gained

08:59.272 --> 09:02.366
allowed us to...
refine our theories.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.207
The Borg have
been waiting

09:09.282 --> 09:11.307
for the chance
to test them out.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.113
Yes.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.210
But we never found
another source of the ore...

09:15.288 --> 09:16.812
until now.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.024
Sorry...

09:23.095 --> 09:26.360
but if someone out there is
experimenting with Omega,

09:26.432 --> 09:28.423
l'm under orders
to stop them.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.629
Otherwise, this entire
Quadrant would be at risk.

09:31.704 --> 09:32.864
Those orders are the result

09:33.005 --> 09:35.530
of Starfleet's ignorance
and fear.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.372
l can alleviate your ignorance.

09:38.444 --> 09:39.376
As for your fear...

09:39.445 --> 09:40.434
Sometimes fear

09:40.513 --> 09:42.413
should be respected, Seven.

09:42.481 --> 09:44.381
Tell me...

09:44.450 --> 09:47.908
how many Borg were sacrificed
during this experiment?

09:48.020 --> 09:52.184
29 vessels, 600, 000 drones,
but that is irrelevant.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.192
Not to me, not to my crew,

09:54.260 --> 09:55.887
and not to the people
who live in this Quadrant.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.896
l'm going to neutralize
this threat, Seven,

09:57.964 --> 09:59.192
with or without your help.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.401
l will assist you.

10:05.471 --> 10:06.938
You will?

10:07.039 --> 10:08.165
l have waited many years

10:08.240 --> 10:09.935
to observe
this molecule firsthand.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.001
l will not deny myself
that experience.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.648
All right.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.252
Go back to your cargo bay.

10:25.324 --> 10:28.452
Assemble all the data
you have about Omega.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.757
l'll expect a report
within the hour.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.298
l didn't realize you had

10:33.366 --> 10:35.926
such a strong
scientific curiosity.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.833
Not curiosity...

10:37.903 --> 10:39.871
desire.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.531
Desire?

10:41.607 --> 10:45.543
Omega is infinitely complex,
yet harmonious.

10:45.611 --> 10:49.274
To the Borg,
it represents perfection.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.749
l wish to understand
that perfection.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.343
The Borg's Holy Grail.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.013
Captain?

10:57.089 --> 10:59.148
Never mind.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.886
l'll see you in an hour.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.641
Arithrazine? What for?

11:17.710 --> 11:18.972
l'm going on an
away mission.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.512
What are you
planning to do--

11:20.579 --> 11:21.944
stroll through
a supernova?

11:22.014 --> 11:23.242
Something like that.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.283
20 milligrams-- when
can you have it ready?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.410
Captain, arithrazine is used

11:27.486 --> 11:28.976
for the most severe cases
of theta

11:29.055 --> 11:30.579
radiation poisoning.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.419
A physician must be present
to monitor the treatment.

11:32.491 --> 11:33.924
That won't be possible.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.688
Then l'm afraid
l can't accommodate you.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.321
l'd be in violation
of Starfleet medical protocols.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.388
Well, l'm overriding
those protocols.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.764
Don't tell me--

11:42.835 --> 11:45.804
"The Omega Directive,"
whatever that might be.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.702
The arithrazine, Doctor.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.804
lt'll be ready in the morning.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.002
Have it sent to the shuttle bay.

11:52.078 --> 11:55.377
Captain, l don't know
what's going on here,

11:55.448 --> 11:58.042
but l'd hate this to be
the last time l ever see you.

11:58.117 --> 11:59.675
Please be careful.

11:59.752 --> 12:00.912
l will.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.494
l've analyzed the sensor logs
using Borg algorithms.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.395
The shock wave we detected
indicates not one

12:12.465 --> 12:15.400
but possibly hundreds
of Omega molecules.

12:16.535 --> 12:17.968
Location?

12:18.037 --> 12:19.334
Within ten light- years.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.066
l'm having
difficulty isolating

12:21.140 --> 12:23.108
the exact star system.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.403
Hundreds of molecules.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.842
That changes everything.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.845
A shuttle mission
may be insufficient.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.347
We require the resources
of this entire crew.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.986
We're going to need
more firepower,

12:35.054 --> 12:37.147
more protection.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.658
Transfer your data
to the Astrometrics Lab.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.194
l'll work
on it there.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.858
Calibration complete.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.899
Phase modulator.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.960
Detonator circuits?

12:53.038 --> 12:54.835
On standby.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.637
We're ready to load
the gravimetric charge.

13:01.747 --> 13:05.342
This looks like enough
for a 50- isoton explosion.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.351
54, to be exact.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.279
What are we planning to do,
blow up a small planet?

13:11.357 --> 13:13.154
l don't know.

13:13.225 --> 13:14.749
This warhead isn't
standard issue.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.192
Who designed it, the Captain?

13:16.262 --> 13:17.661
Mr. Kim, you ask

13:17.730 --> 13:19.391
too many questions.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.830
Change of plans, gentlemen.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.300
lncrease the charge
to 80 isotons.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.461
Aye, Captain.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.561
Harry, when you're done here,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.629
give B'Elanna a hand
with the shuttlecraft.

13:27.706 --> 13:28.968
She's reinforcing the hull.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.268
Right.

13:35.447 --> 13:38.507
Ensign Hickman thinks
it's Species 8472.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.449
Pardon me?

13:40.519 --> 13:41.986
That's his theory.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.247
There's an opening
in fluidic space

13:43.322 --> 13:45.313
and Captain Janeway
has to shut it down.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.757
Want to know what l think?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.124
No.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.331
l think there's
a type- 6 protostar out there

13:54.400 --> 13:56.561
and the Captain's planning
on detonating it

13:56.635 --> 13:57.761
and opening up a wormhole

13:57.837 --> 13:58.929
to the Alpha Quadrant.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.164
ln theory,
it's possible.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.002
And because she doesn't
want to get her hopes up,

14:02.074 --> 14:03.871
she's not telling anybody.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.207
Then l wouldn't suggest
getting your hopes up.

14:07.379 --> 14:08.346
Then what do you think it is?

14:08.414 --> 14:09.346
l do not engage

14:09.415 --> 14:11.007
in idle speculation.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.380
Oh, come on, Tuvok.

14:12.451 --> 14:13.509
Aren't you curious?

14:13.586 --> 14:16.384
Yes, but we have a task at hand.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.286
The phase modulator.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.236
Come in.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.362
Status report.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.838
Everything's going
according to schedule.

14:34.907 --> 14:35.931
Good.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.977
The Omega Directive doesn't
allow me to say much,

14:39.078 --> 14:41.069
but l want you to
know what to expect.

14:41.146 --> 14:43.444
At 0600 hours,
l'll be leaving

14:43.515 --> 14:45.142
in a shuttle with
Seven of Nine.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.611
Would it be out of line
to ask where you're going?

14:48.687 --> 14:50.279
l can tell you this.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.722
One of two things
is going to happen.

14:52.791 --> 14:55.316
Either Seven and l will
succeed on our mission

14:55.494 --> 14:57.121
and return within
a few days,

14:57.196 --> 14:58.993
or your long- range
sensors will detect

14:59.098 --> 15:01.532
a large explosion
in subspace.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.727
lf that occurs, you'll
have less than ten seconds

15:03.802 --> 15:06.066
to jump to warp and
get the hell out of here.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.868
Head for the Alpha Quadrant
and don't look back. Understood?

15:10.676 --> 15:11.904
l always thought that Starfleet

15:11.977 --> 15:14.138
was run
by duty- crazed bureaucrats,

15:14.213 --> 15:15.908
but l find it hard to believe
that even they

15:16.015 --> 15:18.540
would order a Captain
to go on a suicide mission.

15:18.617 --> 15:21.586
This shuttle excursion
is your idea, isn't it?

15:23.055 --> 15:27.014
Let's just say
l've had to amend the Directive,

15:27.092 --> 15:28.889
given the circumstances.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.486
But you have your orders
and l expect you to follow them.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.087
That's expecting a lot.

15:33.165 --> 15:37.067
You're asking me to abandon
my Captain and closest friend

15:37.136 --> 15:38.797
without even telling me why.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.031
lf it were
a simple matter of trust,

15:40.105 --> 15:41.732
l wouldn't hesitate to tell you.

15:43.175 --> 15:44.699
But we've encountered situations

15:44.777 --> 15:47.678
where information
was taken from us by force.

15:47.746 --> 15:50.977
l can't allow knowledge of Omega
to go beyond Voyager.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.950
That's a reasonable argument,

15:53.018 --> 15:54.815
but you're not always
a reasonable woman.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.879
You're determined
to protect this crew

15:57.957 --> 16:00.050
and this time,
you've taken it too far.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.593
A dangerous mission--
fine, l'll acknowledge that--

16:02.661 --> 16:04.151
but isn't it more
likely to succeed

16:04.229 --> 16:06.527
with everyone behind you,
working together?

16:06.598 --> 16:08.532
Ordinarily, l'd agree,

16:08.600 --> 16:11.364
but this Directive was issued
many years ago.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.702
Starfleet didn't exactly have
our predicament in mind, did it?

16:14.773 --> 16:18.004
Lost in the Delta Quadrant
with no backup.

16:18.077 --> 16:21.444
l can't ignore the orders,

16:21.513 --> 16:24.038
but l won't ask the crew
to risk their lives

16:24.116 --> 16:25.481
because of my obligation.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.075
"My obligation."

16:27.152 --> 16:28.915
That's where you're wrong.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.320
Voyager may be alone out here,
but you're not.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.551
Let us help you.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.149
We'll keep
classified information

16:35.227 --> 16:36.717
limited to the senior staff.

16:36.795 --> 16:39.093
We'll take
every security precaution.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.258
Just don't try to do this alone.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.406
Assemble the troops.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.607
lf we were in
the Alpha Quadrant right now,

16:58.684 --> 17:00.447
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.817
l'd be in contact
with Starfleet Command

17:02.888 --> 17:04.355
and they'd send in
a specialized team

17:04.423 --> 17:05.856
to deal with the crisis.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.358
ln their absence, we're
going to have to make do

17:08.426 --> 17:09.519
with the training
l've received

17:09.595 --> 17:10.561
and the knowledge

17:10.628 --> 17:13.029
Seven of Nine has
retained from the Borg.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.366
You've all seen
this symbol.

17:17.435 --> 17:21.065
Omega...the last letter
of the Greek alphabet--

17:21.140 --> 17:22.607
chosen by Starfleet

17:22.674 --> 17:24.539
to represent a threat
not only to the Federation

17:24.609 --> 17:26.601
but to the entire galaxy.

17:26.678 --> 17:29.647
Only starship captains
and Federation flag officers

17:29.715 --> 17:32.183
have been briefed
on the nature of this threat.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.679
What you're about to hear will
not go beyond these bulkheads.

17:36.755 --> 17:37.744
ls that clear?

17:40.492 --> 17:41.789
Good.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.597
This is Omega.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.641
A molecule?

17:56.708 --> 17:59.074
Not just any molecule...

17:59.144 --> 18:02.045
the most powerful substance
known to exist.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.876
A single Omega molecule

18:03.916 --> 18:07.010
contains the same energy
as a warp core.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.783
ln theory, a small chain of them
could sustain

18:10.856 --> 18:11.788
a civilization.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.324
The molecule was
first synthesized

18:13.392 --> 18:14.450
over a hundred years ago

18:14.526 --> 18:17.620
by a Starfleet physicist
named Ketteract.

18:17.696 --> 18:21.257
l think he was hoping to develop
an inexhaustible power source.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.766
Or a weapon.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.666
Ketteract managed to synthesize

18:24.736 --> 18:29.173
a single molecule particle
of Omega,

18:29.241 --> 18:31.732
but it only existed
for a fraction of a second

18:31.810 --> 18:33.710
before it destabilized.

18:36.915 --> 18:42.376
This was a classified research
center in the Lantaru Sector.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.046
Ketteract and 126

18:44.123 --> 18:46.614
of the Federation's
leading scientists

18:46.692 --> 18:48.853
were lost in the accident.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.862
Rescue teams
attempting to reach the site

18:51.930 --> 18:53.727
discovered an unexpected

18:53.799 --> 18:55.664
secondary effect.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.497
There were
subspace ruptures

18:57.569 --> 19:00.766
extending out
several light- years.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.637
The Lantaru Sector...

19:03.709 --> 19:06.303
it's impossible to create
a stable warp field there.

19:06.378 --> 19:08.778
You can only fly through
it at sublight speeds.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.577
But l was always told that it
was a natural phenomenon.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.413
You're saying it was caused

19:13.485 --> 19:15.350
by a single molecule
of this stuff?

19:15.420 --> 19:17.650
Omega destroys subspace.

19:17.723 --> 19:21.215
A chain reaction
involving a handful of molecules

19:21.293 --> 19:24.558
could devastate subspace
throughout an entire Quadrant.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.860
lf that were to happen,

19:26.932 --> 19:29.492
warp travel
would become impossible.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.695
Spacefaring civilization
as we know it

19:31.770 --> 19:33.863
would cease to exist.

19:33.939 --> 19:36.373
When Starfleet realized
Omega's power,

19:36.441 --> 19:37.999
they suppressed
all knowledge of it.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.509
Have you detected
Omega here

19:39.578 --> 19:41.443
in the Delta Quadrant?

19:41.513 --> 19:42.775
l'm afraid so.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.316
l've been authorized to use

19:46.385 --> 19:49.013
whatever means necessary
to destroy it.

19:49.087 --> 19:51.180
Tom, l've calculated

19:51.256 --> 19:53.224
the location of the molecules.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.317
l'll transfer the coordinates
to the helm.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.225
Take us there at full impulse.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.786
Aye, Captain.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.355
l don't have to tell you
what's at stake.

20:01.433 --> 20:05.335
lf a large- scale
Omega explosion occurs,

20:05.404 --> 20:08.931
we will lose the ability
to go to warp forever.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.770
We've got our work

20:10.842 --> 20:11.934
cut out for us.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.985
Captain's Log, supplemental.
Encrypt log entry.

20:29.094 --> 20:30.686
We're approaching
the star system

20:30.762 --> 20:32.423
where we believe
we'll find Omega.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.988
l have to admit,
l've never been

20:35.067 --> 20:36.898
this apprehensive
about a mission.

20:36.969 --> 20:40.268
l know how Einstein must have
felt about the atom bomb,

20:40.339 --> 20:42.933
or Marcus when she developed
the Genesis Device.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.976
They watched helplessly
as science

20:45.043 --> 20:46.908
took a destructive course,

20:46.979 --> 20:49.812
but l have the chance
to prevent that from happening.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.405
l just hope it's not too late.

20:51.483 --> 20:52.973
Status report?

20:53.051 --> 20:55.815
This is a harmonic
resonance chamber.

20:55.887 --> 20:58.515
The Borg designed it
to contain and stabilize Omega.

21:00.058 --> 21:02.526
l thought l asked you to
work on the photon torpedo.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.687
The torpedo may be
insufficient.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.926
l can modify this chamber
to emit an inverse frequency.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.367
lt will be enough to dissolve
Omega's interatomic bonds.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.138
Here's to Borg ingenuity.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.110
This is excellent
work, Seven.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.078
We may need this.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.614
The modifications require

21:23.682 --> 21:24.944
several complex
calculations.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.746
Assist me.

21:26.818 --> 21:28.718
l guess l will.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.919
l'm curious...

21:31.990 --> 21:33.981
when did the Borg
discover Omega?

21:34.059 --> 21:35.993
229 years ago.

21:36.061 --> 21:37.653
Assimilation?
Yes.

21:37.729 --> 21:39.390
Of 13 different species.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.658
Thirteen?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.759
lt began with Species 262.

21:43.835 --> 21:45.632
They were primitive,
but their oral history

21:45.704 --> 21:47.672
referred to
a powerful substance

21:47.739 --> 21:49.229
which could"burn the sky."

21:49.308 --> 21:53.301
The Borg were intrigued...
which led them to Species 263.

21:53.378 --> 21:54.538
They, too, were primitive

21:54.613 --> 21:57.173
and believed it was a drop
of blood from their creator.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.307
Fascinating.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.975
Yes, but irrelevant.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.748
We followed this trail of myth
for many years

22:02.821 --> 22:04.789
until finally
assimilating a species

22:04.856 --> 22:06.448
with useful scientific data.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.459
We then created
the molecule ourselves.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.223
Omega caused
quite a stir

22:11.296 --> 22:12.923
among my own species.

22:13.031 --> 22:15.465
Federation cosmologists
had a theory--

22:15.534 --> 22:19.664
that the molecule
once existed in nature...

22:19.738 --> 22:22.673
for an infinitesimal period
of time

22:22.741 --> 22:25.232
at the exact moment
of the big bang.

22:25.310 --> 22:28.279
Some claimed Omega
was the primal source of energy

22:28.347 --> 22:30.907
for the explosion
that began our universe.

22:30.982 --> 22:32.745
A creation myth, like any other.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.149
Perhaps.

22:34.219 --> 22:36.710
What is it the Borg say?

22:36.788 --> 22:38.415
That Omega is perfect?

22:38.490 --> 22:39.752
Yes.

22:39.825 --> 22:42.419
ls that a theory or a belief?

22:42.494 --> 22:44.291
Bridge to Captain.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.330
Go ahead.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.126
We're approaching
the coordinates.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.427
l'm on my way.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.627
l'm leaving this project
in your hands.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.569
Use whatever resources
and personnel you need.

22:53.638 --> 22:54.570
Understood.

23:02.147 --> 23:03.614
We've entered a
planetary system.

23:03.682 --> 23:04.649
lnhabited?

23:04.716 --> 23:06.183
There's a pre- warp
civilization

23:06.251 --> 23:07.513
on the outermost planet.

23:07.586 --> 23:09.645
The source of Omega
seems to be further in.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.349
The damage to subspace
in this region is extreme.

23:12.424 --> 23:14.187
We won't be able
to go to warp.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.885
We are encountering distortions.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.089
Track their origin.

23:19.164 --> 23:21.462
An M- Class moon.

23:21.533 --> 23:22.932
We're in visual range.

23:23.001 --> 23:24.593
On screen.

23:26.271 --> 23:27.932
There is a subnucleonic reaction

23:28.073 --> 23:30.098
occurring
in the upper atmosphere.

23:30.175 --> 23:31.233
lt is apparently emanating

23:31.309 --> 23:32.901
from a structure
on the moon's surface.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.707
Can your sensors
penetrate the atmosphere?

23:34.780 --> 23:35.712
Stand by.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.645
My God.

23:38.717 --> 23:39.684
Over 300, 000

23:39.751 --> 23:41.810
square kilometers...
destroyed.

23:41.887 --> 23:44.856
Scan the structure.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.790
Are there any Omega
molecules remaining?

23:47.859 --> 23:49.417
l can't tell.

23:49.494 --> 23:52.486
Several sections of the outpost
are still shielded.

23:52.564 --> 23:53.861
l'm detecting life signs.

23:53.932 --> 23:54.796
How many?

23:54.866 --> 23:55.798
A few dozen, maybe.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.425
lt's hard to get
a clear reading.

23:57.502 --> 23:59.333
Harry, can we transport
to the surface?

23:59.404 --> 24:00.769
l can get you there,

24:00.872 --> 24:02.635
but conditions in the structure
aren't good.

24:02.674 --> 24:04.164
There are high levels
of radiation.

24:04.342 --> 24:05.707
Tuvok...

24:05.777 --> 24:08.007
assemble a rescue team

24:08.079 --> 24:11.480
and have them report to Sick Bay
for arithrazine inoculations.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.916
Tell the Doctor to
prepare for casualties.

24:13.985 --> 24:16.215
Tom, move Voyager
into a high orbit

24:16.288 --> 24:17.550
and then join
the away team.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.611
We'll need a field medic.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.089
Yes, ma'am.

24:20.158 --> 24:21.489
You're going with them?

24:21.560 --> 24:24.222
lf Omega's still down there,
l have to find it.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.093
l'll keep an open com- link
with the ship.

24:26.164 --> 24:27.563
You have the Bridge.

24:46.451 --> 24:48.976
l'm picking up
Omega's resonance frequency.

24:49.054 --> 24:52.285
lt's here,
but l can't pinpoint a location.

24:57.195 --> 24:58.457
l need to ask you questions

24:58.530 --> 25:01.260
about the experiments
you've been conducting here.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.962
There was...an accident.

25:07.405 --> 25:09.873
We lost containment.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.908
The substance you were
trying to create--

25:11.977 --> 25:15.310
did any of it
survive the explosion?

25:15.380 --> 25:16.312
Yes.

25:16.381 --> 25:17.348
Where?

25:20.452 --> 25:23.785
lnside the primary
test chamber.

25:27.726 --> 25:29.557
- Who are you?
- Captain Janeway

25:29.628 --> 25:31.289
of the Starship Voyager.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.625
We're here to help you.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.756
Away team to Voyager.
Two to beam

25:34.833 --> 25:35.765
directly to Sick Bay.

25:35.834 --> 25:36.858
Aye, Captain.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.538
This door is solid duritanium

25:41.606 --> 25:42.868
13 centimeters thick.

25:42.941 --> 25:43.930
Can we get it open?

25:44.042 --> 25:45.031
The duritanium
has melted

25:45.110 --> 25:46.805
into the door frame.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.812
We'll need to cut
through the metal with phasers.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.847
Do it.

25:49.915 --> 25:50.973
Captain...

25:51.049 --> 25:52.539
l'd be negligent
if l didn't point out

25:52.617 --> 25:55.211
that we are about to violate
the Prime Directive.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.777
For the duration
of this mission,

25:56.855 --> 25:58.447
the Prime Directive
is rescinded.

25:58.523 --> 25:59.990
Let's get this over with.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.762
Crewman Dell,
l'm assigning you a task

26:14.839 --> 26:16.534
more suited
to your abilities.

26:16.608 --> 26:19.907
Calibrate the ionic- pressure
seals on the observation ports.

26:20.011 --> 26:22.411
Your new designation
is Three of Ten.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.412
Yes, ma'am.

26:33.391 --> 26:36.292
l've got more isolinear
processors for you to install.

26:36.361 --> 26:37.623
Thanks,

26:37.696 --> 26:39.630
but l need to get the power
relays on line first.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.666
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

26:41.733 --> 26:43.724
Ensign Wildman
was assigned to that.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.394
This is ridiculous.

26:45.470 --> 26:46.402
l'm not going
to waste time

26:46.471 --> 26:48.132
just because Seven
wants to turn this team

26:48.206 --> 26:49.468
into her own
private collective.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.441
She says
it's more efficient.

26:51.509 --> 26:52.942
Maybe for a
bunch of drones.

26:56.848 --> 26:58.975
Six of Ten, this is
not your assignment.

26:59.084 --> 27:01.382
Please, stop
calling me that.

27:01.486 --> 27:04.148
You are compromising
our productivity.

27:07.158 --> 27:09.626
l am reassigning you
to chamber maintenance.

27:09.694 --> 27:12.492
Your new designation
is Two of Ten.

27:14.099 --> 27:17.364
Wait a minute.
You're demoting me?

27:17.435 --> 27:19.460
Since when do the Borg
pull rank?

27:19.537 --> 27:21.402
A Starfleet protocol l adapted.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.441
l find it most useful.

27:23.508 --> 27:25.976
l'm glad you're not the Captain.

27:28.780 --> 27:29.769
How's it coming?

27:29.848 --> 27:30.872
The crew can be
quite efficient

27:31.016 --> 27:32.608
when properly organized.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.811
The harmonic chamber will be
completed within the hour.

27:34.886 --> 27:35.853
Good.
l'll let the Captain know.

27:35.920 --> 27:36.852
Has she
retrieved

27:36.921 --> 27:37.910
any new data from the surface?

27:38.023 --> 27:39.183
Not yet.

27:39.257 --> 27:40.519
They're still trying to access

27:40.592 --> 27:41.650
the primary test chamber.

27:41.726 --> 27:42.715
Were there survivors?

27:42.794 --> 27:45.024
A few. The Doctor's
treating them in Sick Bay.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.488
Commander.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.337
Seven's taking this
"hive mentality"

27:53.405 --> 27:54.895
just a little too far.

27:54.973 --> 27:56.736
Designated functions,
numbered drones...

27:56.808 --> 27:57.775
l wouldn't be surprised

27:57.842 --> 27:59.469
if she started plugging
us into alcoves.

27:59.544 --> 28:02.911
When in the collective,
Harry...adapt.

28:18.663 --> 28:20.858
Which of them is the
senior researcher?

28:20.965 --> 28:22.865
This gentleman.
Why do you ask?

28:22.934 --> 28:25.198
He has knowledge
l require.

28:25.270 --> 28:26.862
He also happens to be
barely conscious.

28:26.938 --> 28:27.870
Come back in an hour.

28:27.939 --> 28:28.906
Unacceptable.

28:28.973 --> 28:30.133
Unavoidable.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.175
This is my Sick Bay.

28:31.242 --> 28:32.368
The man needs to recover.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.502
The Captain left me

28:33.578 --> 28:35.603
in charge of our
efforts on Voyager.

28:35.680 --> 28:36.647
l would be negligent

28:36.715 --> 28:38.649
if l ignored a new
source of information.

28:45.190 --> 28:48.250
Our next social skills
seminar is entitled

28:48.326 --> 28:51.727
"Adding Diplomatic Flair
to Future Negotiations."

28:56.000 --> 28:57.399
How are you feeling, sir?

28:58.803 --> 29:00.862
Better. Thank you.

29:00.972 --> 29:05.068
Are you comfortable enough
to speak with this individual?

29:07.445 --> 29:09.413
Keep it brief.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.113
How many of the molecules
were you able

29:16.187 --> 29:17.484
to synthesize?

29:17.555 --> 29:20.217
200 million?

29:20.291 --> 29:21.781
l'm not certain.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.454
What is the iso- frequency
of your containment field?

29:24.529 --> 29:26.861
1. 68 terahertz.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.592
We used the molecule's

29:28.666 --> 29:30.759
own resonance
to calculate the field.

29:30.835 --> 29:32.928
That should've been enough
to stabilize them.

29:34.139 --> 29:35.800
Obviously it wasn't.

29:35.874 --> 29:39.776
Obviously,
but your approach is innovative.

29:39.844 --> 29:43.302
Perhaps l can adapt your
technique and improve upon it.

29:43.381 --> 29:45.178
You will assist me.

29:48.853 --> 29:52.118
Our equipment was destroyed.

29:52.190 --> 29:57.457
lf you can transfer
the molecules to your ship...

29:57.529 --> 29:59.588
maybe they can be saved.

29:59.664 --> 30:01.928
l have no intention
of saving them.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.592
What?

30:03.668 --> 30:06.603
My orders are to destroy
the Omega molecules.

30:06.671 --> 30:10.107
This is my life's work...
the salvation of my people.

30:10.175 --> 30:11.369
Will you assist me or not?

30:11.442 --> 30:14.934
Our resources are nearly gone.

30:15.013 --> 30:18.540
The future of my people
depends on this discovery!

30:18.616 --> 30:20.311
Then your answer is no.

30:21.953 --> 30:24.615
Small- minded creatures.

30:24.689 --> 30:27.988
You destroy whatever
you don't understand!

30:29.527 --> 30:31.654
Rescue ships are on the way.

30:31.729 --> 30:33.924
They won't let you do it.

30:35.466 --> 30:37.457
Please, try
to be calm.

30:37.535 --> 30:39.093
Seven, you'll
have to leave.

30:42.373 --> 30:44.671
You don't realize
what you're doing.

30:44.742 --> 30:48.838
You don't know what this is...
what this means...

30:48.913 --> 30:50.676
On the contrary.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.680
l understand perfectly.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.901
We've disabled
the locking mechanism.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.035
Narrow your phaser beams to
cut through the inner seal.

31:20.111 --> 31:21.078
lnadvisable.

31:21.145 --> 31:22.840
We'd risk penetrating
the containment field.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.640
Then we'll have to use
some elbow grease.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.845
Give me a hand.

31:30.655 --> 31:31.644
Oh.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.388
Right.

31:54.612 --> 31:57.046
There's enough here
to wipe out subspace

31:57.148 --> 31:58.775
across half the Quadrant.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.216
l'll order the away
teams back to Voyager,

32:01.319 --> 32:03.879
and target this facility
with a gravimetric charge.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.911
lt won't be enough.

32:04.989 --> 32:07.048
We'll have to go
with our Borg option.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.217
Ensign.

32:08.293 --> 32:09.419
Yes, Captain.

32:09.494 --> 32:11.189
Return to the ship.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.627
Tell Commander Chakotay

32:12.697 --> 32:14.927
to help Seven complete
the harmonic chamber.

32:17.201 --> 32:19.533
We'll have to transport Omega
directly to the ship.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.593
That means finding a way

32:20.672 --> 32:22.162
to shut down
this containment field.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.299
lt's unfortunate
we can't study

32:24.375 --> 32:26.434
this phenomenon
in more detail.

32:26.511 --> 32:27.978
We may not have the
opportunity again.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.946
Let's hope we never do.

32:30.014 --> 32:33.142
A curious statement
from a woman of science.

32:33.217 --> 32:35.947
l'm also a woman who
occasionally knows when to quit.

32:38.222 --> 32:40.486
Take another look
at your tricorder.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.822
Omega's too dangerous.

32:44.896 --> 32:48.593
l won't risk half the Quadrant
to satisfy our curiosity.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.191
lt's arrogant
and it's irresponsible.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.575
The final frontier
has some boundaries

32:58.643 --> 33:00.076
that shouldn't be crossed...

33:01.579 --> 33:03.308
and we're looking at one.

33:04.782 --> 33:06.841
We don't need to destroy
the molecules.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.476
l believe l've found a way
to stabilize them.

33:08.553 --> 33:11.113
The alien in Sick Bay
calibrated

33:11.189 --> 33:13.453
his containment field using
Omega's own resonance--

33:13.524 --> 33:15.492
an approach unknown
to the Borg.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.857
l have modified
this chamber...

33:16.928 --> 33:18.589
Those weren't
your orders.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.426
The Captain wants
Omega eliminated.

33:22.233 --> 33:23.791
That is still an option

33:23.868 --> 33:27.031
if she insists on
yielding to her fear.

33:28.606 --> 33:29.800
Show me what you've done.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.811
This simulation
shows the molecules

33:33.878 --> 33:36.642
in their free state,
highly unstable.

33:36.714 --> 33:39.979
l've modified the chamber
to emit a harmonic wave form

33:40.051 --> 33:41.848
that will dampen
the molecules.

33:41.919 --> 33:45.719
Looks great in theory,
but this is only a simulation.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.052
How are you going to test it?

33:48.726 --> 33:50.159
On Omega.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.186
Bad idea.

33:53.264 --> 33:55.858
One mistake and no one will
be around for a second try.

33:55.933 --> 33:57.264
lt will work.

33:57.335 --> 33:58.632
Someday, maybe.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.000
Hang on to your research.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.835
For now, we stick to the plan.

34:01.906 --> 34:03.373
Stand by to transport

34:03.441 --> 34:06.308
the molecules into this chamber
and neutralize them as ordered.

34:06.477 --> 34:09.844
l have been a member
of this crew for nine months.

34:09.914 --> 34:10.880
ln all of that time,

34:11.014 --> 34:13.176
l have never made
a personal request.

34:13.251 --> 34:15.411
l am making one now.

34:15.485 --> 34:16.851
Allow me to proceed.

34:18.356 --> 34:20.187
Please.

34:20.257 --> 34:23.318
Why is this so important to you?

34:26.464 --> 34:28.898
Particle zero- one- zero...

34:28.966 --> 34:31.935
the Borg designation
for what you call Omega.

34:32.036 --> 34:34.197
Every drone is aware
of its existence.

34:34.272 --> 34:37.400
We were instructed
to assimilate it at all costs.

34:37.475 --> 34:40.842
lt is...

34:40.911 --> 34:42.402
perfection.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.416
The molecules exist
in a flawless state--

34:46.484 --> 34:49.976
infinite parts
functioning as one.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.578
Like the Borg.

34:53.524 --> 34:55.685
Precisely.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.491
l am no longer Borg,

34:59.564 --> 35:02.761
but l still need to understand
that perfection.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.995
Without it, my existence
will never be complete.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.809
Commander,
you are a spiritual man.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.436
That's right.

35:15.513 --> 35:20.507
lf you had the chance to see
your God, your Great Spirit,

35:20.585 --> 35:22.985
what would you do?

35:24.589 --> 35:27.717
l'd pursue it...
with all my heart.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.420
Then you understand.

35:30.495 --> 35:32.929
l think l do.

35:33.030 --> 35:36.329
l'll inform the Captain
of your discovery.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.961
For now, her orders stand.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.330
Thank you.

35:59.223 --> 36:02.420
Set the confinement beam
to its narrowest dispersion.

36:02.527 --> 36:03.516
Understood.

36:03.561 --> 36:06.689
We'll target this facility
with the gravimetric torpedo.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.755
lf anything goes wrong
during transport,

36:08.833 --> 36:10.323
that'll be our only hope.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.028
Bridge to Janeway.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.435
We've detected two ships
on an intercept course.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.564
They're not responding to hails.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.040
How long until they get here?

36:18.109 --> 36:19.508
Less than four
minutes, Captain.

36:19.577 --> 36:20.635
Stand by to transport

36:20.711 --> 36:22.770
the molecules directly
to the harmonic chamber.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.610
Understood.
Bridge to Cargo Bay.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.309
Yes, Commander.

36:26.384 --> 36:27.442
Seven, get ready.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.883
We'll have to do this quickly.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.386
That's not advisable.

36:30.454 --> 36:31.386
We don't have a choice.

36:31.455 --> 36:32.854
The alien ships
are on their way.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.289
Then l recommend moving the ship

36:34.358 --> 36:36.451
within 5, 000 kilometers
of the surface.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.552
That'll take us
right into the atmosphere.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.324
With our shields down,
we won't be able to withstand

36:40.398 --> 36:42.923
the thermal reaction
for more than a few seconds.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.433
Then we'll only get one shot
at this.

36:44.502 --> 36:45.526
Take us in.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.230
Aye, sir.

36:47.305 --> 36:48.670
Transporter status?

36:48.739 --> 36:50.400
Targeting scanners are locked.

36:50.474 --> 36:51.702
Captain, are you ready?

36:52.743 --> 36:54.608
Pattern enhancers are active.

36:54.679 --> 36:55.543
Do it.

36:55.613 --> 36:56.910
We're 1 1, 000 kilometers

36:56.981 --> 36:58.073
from the surface.

36:58.149 --> 37:00.276
lf we get much closer,
we'll incinerate.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.715
We're losing
structural integrity.

37:01.752 --> 37:03.151
9, 000 Kilometers.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.552
We're close enough.

37:04.622 --> 37:05.714
Energize.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.314
lnitiating transport.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.023
The Omega molecules are stable.

37:14.098 --> 37:16.362
Transport was successful.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.629
l've got the away team
in Transporter Room 2.

37:18.703 --> 37:20.261
Get us out of here,
maximum impulse.

37:20.338 --> 37:21.600
Already on it.

37:21.672 --> 37:22.798
How far away are those ships?

37:22.873 --> 37:25.171
They're right on our tail.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.252
We're heading
into an area of open space--

37:38.322 --> 37:40.517
no indications of life
or any kind of technology.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.183
We can carry out
the procedure

37:42.260 --> 37:43.784
with no risk
to anyone else.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.385
Except those two ships
behind us.

37:45.463 --> 37:46.430
Can we stay
ahead of them?

37:46.497 --> 37:47.623
Not for long.

37:47.698 --> 37:49.757
How soon can we clear
the subspace ruptures

37:49.834 --> 37:50.766
and go to warp?

37:50.835 --> 37:52.393
Ten, maybe 15 minutes,

37:52.470 --> 37:54.768
but those ships will catch up
to us before then.

37:54.839 --> 37:57.364
Well, we have one advantage.
We've got Omega.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.908
They won't risk
firing at us.

37:58.976 --> 38:00.773
At least not until they've
run out of options.

38:00.878 --> 38:01.845
That should
give us a chance

38:01.946 --> 38:03.038
to neutralize
the molecules.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.775
Captain, we might have
another problem.

38:04.849 --> 38:06.316
Seven of Nine?

38:06.384 --> 38:08.852
She's convinced she
can stabilize Omega.

38:08.919 --> 38:10.750
l thought
we'd settled that question.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.413
While you were on the surface,
she showed me

38:12.490 --> 38:14.515
a pretty convincing simulation
of how it could be done.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.992
l should've known
she wouldn't just let this go.

38:17.061 --> 38:18.221
l'll be in Cargo Bay 2.

38:27.371 --> 38:28.838
Seven, the procedure?

38:28.906 --> 38:29.873
lt's working.

38:30.007 --> 38:32.407
1 1 percent Of the molecules
have already been neutralized.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.068
Let's see if we can speed
up the process a little.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.272
Did Commander Chakotay
tell you about my idea?

38:36.347 --> 38:37.507
Yes.

38:37.581 --> 38:39.014
Then you will allow me

38:39.083 --> 38:41.017
to stabilize
the remaining molecules.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.313
You know l can't do that.

38:43.521 --> 38:45.819
Your Starfleet Directive
is no longer relevant.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.653
l have found a way
to control Omega.

38:47.725 --> 38:49.886
l don't care if you can
make it sing and dance.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.120
We're getting rid of it.

38:52.229 --> 38:53.253
A foolish decision.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.458
Yes, but it's mine to make.
Now, step aside.

38:58.736 --> 39:01.136
l could've done this
without your permission,

39:01.238 --> 39:04.298
but l chose to follow
your command structure.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.702
l should've made the attempt.

39:07.778 --> 39:09.939
l still can.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.106
But you won't.

39:13.818 --> 39:17.219
You know l'm not trying to stop
you from finding perfection,

39:17.288 --> 39:20.951
but l can't risk the
safety of this Quadrant.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.859
Omega must end here.
We both know that.

39:38.809 --> 39:40.276
Status?

39:40.344 --> 39:42.107
18 percent.

39:42.179 --> 39:43.669
This could take hours.

39:43.748 --> 39:46.080
Can you increase the
harmonic resonance?

39:46.150 --> 39:47.515
Yes, but it would rupture
the chamber.

39:49.587 --> 39:52.055
How many molecules
would we neutralize?

39:52.123 --> 39:53.818
40, 50 percent at best.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.089
That's good enough.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.527
Our torpedo
can take care of the rest.

39:59.597 --> 40:00.723
Janeway to Bridge.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.026
Chakotay here.

40:02.099 --> 40:03.896
Chakotay, l want you
to clear Deck 4.

40:03.968 --> 40:06.937
Put emergency force fields
around this section.

40:07.037 --> 40:09.562
Prepare to decompress
Cargo Bay 2 on my command.

40:09.640 --> 40:10.607
Understood.

40:10.674 --> 40:13.199
Tuvok, load
the gravimetric torpedo.

40:13.277 --> 40:16.713
Once we've jettisoned
the chamber, fire.

40:16.781 --> 40:17.713
Aye, Captain.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.613
Harmonic resonance to maximum.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.316
Commander, they're
closing on us.

40:27.391 --> 40:28.323
They're attempting

40:28.392 --> 40:29.950
to stop us with a tractor beam.

40:30.027 --> 40:31.619
Adjust shields to compensate.

40:31.695 --> 40:32.593
They're hailing us.

40:32.663 --> 40:33.595
On screen.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.530
Disengage your engines

40:35.599 --> 40:37.123
and prepare to be boarded.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.259
l can't do that.

40:38.335 --> 40:40.895
You've stolen our technology,

40:40.971 --> 40:42.404
abducted our people.

40:42.473 --> 40:43.440
Your people are safe.

40:43.507 --> 40:44.906
They're receiving medical care.

40:44.975 --> 40:46.966
l'll be glad to get them
back to you when this is over,

40:47.044 --> 40:48.978
but we're keeping the molecules.

40:49.046 --> 40:51.606
l won't allow this substance
to fall into enemy hands.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.047
l'll destroy it first.

40:53.150 --> 40:54.515
They're charging weapons.

40:54.585 --> 40:56.018
You'll destabilize
the molecules.

40:56.086 --> 40:57.053
We'll both
be destroyed.

40:57.154 --> 41:00.419
Then return
our technology...now!

41:00.491 --> 41:02.925
l'm sorry.
That's not possible.

41:09.767 --> 41:12.167
Direct hit.
Shields down ten percent.

41:12.236 --> 41:14.170
Evasive maneuvers.
Try to shake them off.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.198
Harmonic resonance
at maximum, Captain.

41:18.275 --> 41:19.242
The molecules?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.800
80 percent remaining.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.470
We need to get that
down to 60.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.949
Any damage to our
power grid could

41:26.083 --> 41:28.108
overload the chamber--
Omega would chain- react.

41:28.185 --> 41:29.675
The same thought
crossed my mind.

41:31.021 --> 41:31.988
Where are we now?

41:32.056 --> 41:33.887
72 percent.

41:33.958 --> 41:34.890
That's close enough.

41:34.959 --> 41:36.654
Bridge, start
the decompression sequence.

41:36.727 --> 41:37.921
Acknowledged.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.763
What's wrong?
What's happening?

41:40.831 --> 41:42.992
The molecules
are stabilizing.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.397
What?

41:44.468 --> 41:45.400
l've done nothing.

41:45.469 --> 41:46.561
lt's occurring
spontaneously.

41:46.637 --> 41:47.899
That's impossible.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.400
Decompression in 30 seconds.

41:54.478 --> 41:57.675
Decompression in 25 seconds.

41:57.748 --> 41:59.978
Seven, let's move!

42:00.084 --> 42:03.053
Decompression in 20 seconds.

42:03.087 --> 42:04.816
Seven.

42:04.889 --> 42:07.551
Decompression in 15 seconds.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.394
Decompression in ten seconds.

42:12.463 --> 42:14.055
Tom, are we clear
of the subspace ruptures?

42:14.131 --> 42:15.063
Almost.

42:15.132 --> 42:16.827
l need maximum warp
within ten seconds

42:16.901 --> 42:18.391
or we'll be stuck
at ground zero.

42:18.469 --> 42:19.868
Yes, sir.

42:19.937 --> 42:21.529
Decompression is complete.

42:21.605 --> 42:23.698
The harmonic chamber
has been jettisoned.

42:23.774 --> 42:25.366
Fire.

42:33.717 --> 42:36.584
We made it.
We're at warp 1.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.887
The alien ships?

42:39.957 --> 42:41.185
Out of range.

42:41.258 --> 42:42.418
Tuvok?

42:42.493 --> 42:44.927
Sensors show no traces
of Omega molecules.

42:54.338 --> 42:56.363
Mission accomplished.

43:12.723 --> 43:17.023
Captain's Log,
Stardate 51793. 4.

43:17.094 --> 43:19.255
We've arranged
for our guests in Sick Bay

43:19.330 --> 43:21.264
to be taken back
to their homeworld,

43:21.332 --> 43:24.199
and we can finally
put this mission behind us.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.031
This will be
my last encrypted log

43:26.103 --> 43:28.071
concerning the Omega Directive.

43:28.138 --> 43:31.130
The classified data files
will now be destroyed.

43:35.212 --> 43:37.112
l wondered who was
running my program.

43:37.181 --> 43:40.446
Master da Vinci doesn't like
visitors after midnight.

43:40.517 --> 43:43.543
He protested.
l deactivated him.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.748
What're you
doing here, Seven?

43:45.823 --> 43:50.487
This simulation contains...
many religious components.

43:50.561 --> 43:52.324
l was studying them

43:52.396 --> 43:55.991
to help me understand
what l saw in Cargo Bay 2.

43:56.066 --> 43:58.557
The data wasn't clear
on why Omega

43:58.636 --> 44:01.730
stabilized in the last few
seconds, but chances are

44:01.839 --> 44:06.105
it was simply a chaotic anomaly,
nothing more.

44:06.143 --> 44:09.112
For 3. 2 seconds...

44:09.179 --> 44:11.943
l saw perfection.

44:14.752 --> 44:20.213
When Omega stabilized,
l felt a curious sensation.

44:20.290 --> 44:24.021
As l was watching it,
it seemed to be watching me.

44:36.106 --> 44:38.574
The Borg have
assimilated many species

44:38.642 --> 44:42.703
with mythologies to explain
such moments of clarity.

44:42.780 --> 44:45.943
l've always dismissed
them as trivial.

44:48.886 --> 44:50.251
Perhaps l was wrong.

44:55.225 --> 44:57.022
lf l didn't
know you better...

44:58.996 --> 45:02.955
l'd say you just had
your first spiritual experience.
