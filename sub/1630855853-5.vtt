I don’t know if you could
call it confidence,

13:52.957 --> 13:55.037
but it was peace.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.835
I truly
became an artist here.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.086
It’s like I could fly.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.548

14:12.977 --> 14:14.647
-What if I can’t?
-Yes, you can.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.233
Just because you’re used to
doing things a certain way,

14:18.358 --> 14:20.028
doesn’t mean you can’t move on
from that,

just as well.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.176
That property’s at least
a hundred years old.

Zooey’s got those.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.492
There is something in that house
with a weird sense of humor

15:12.620 --> 15:14.160

do a lot of damage.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.998

15:17.291 --> 15:19.131

Because it’s 40% below asking,
Mister Kerr.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.572
No! He’ll be offended.
He’ll be pissed.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.902
People are submitting offers
ten percent above asking

15:45.027 --> 15:46.357
just to get in
that neighborhood.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.407
If I submit that offer,
he’ll think I’m a lightweight

15:48.531 --> 15:51.161

I couldn’t stop painting.

this house has been

31:42.150 --> 31:43.860

With you.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.946
It needs something from you.
