00:21.888 --> 00:24.379
BERKELEY: Ready to beam down.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.128
Energize.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.467
BERKELEY: Energize.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.043
Having trouble, gentlemen?

00:51.151 --> 00:52.413
I just don't understand
the problem, sir.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.352
You're beaming cargo down
to a penal colony, Mr. Berkeley.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.548
Their security force field, sir.

00:57.657 --> 00:59.591
U.S.S. Enterprise
to Tantalus colony.

00:59.692 --> 01:01.125
WOMAN: Rehab colony. Come in.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.287
Request opening in your force field
for beaming down of cargo.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.365
Enterprise, affirmative.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.730
Our security cover is now open.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.429
Energize.

01:17.944 --> 01:18.911
Any incoming cargo?

01:19.012 --> 01:20.741
Just one item, sir.
Some research material

01:20.847 --> 01:23.680
bound for the Central Bureau
of Penology at Stockholm.

01:23.783 --> 01:26.149
WOMAN: Tantalus cargo
ready to beam up.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.391
Oh, Mr. Berkeley...

01:39.499 --> 01:41.831
you might refamiliarize yourself

01:41.935 --> 01:43.129
with the manual
on penal colony procedures.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.863
Immediately, sir.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.462
I think you can take
the time to lock this up first.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.633
I'll get a vault assignment.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.104
KIRK: Space...

02:57.210 --> 02:59.610
the final frontier.

02:59.712 --> 03:03.148
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.944
Its five-year mission:

03:05.051 --> 03:08.384
to explore
strange new worlds...

03:08.488 --> 03:12.322
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

03:12.425 --> 03:15.986
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

03:48.027 --> 03:50.894
KIRK: Captain's log,
stardate 2715.1.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.228
Exchanged cargo with
penal colony on Tantalus 5.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.962
I've departed
without going ashore.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.131
I would like to
have met Dr. Adams.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.209
Have you ever been
to a penal colony

04:03.309 --> 04:05.300
since they started
following his theories?

04:05.411 --> 04:06.742
A cage is a cage, Jim.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.837
You're behind the times, Bones.

04:08.948 --> 04:12.213
They're more like
resort colonies now.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.081
UHURA: Message, Captain.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.313
Switching to speaker.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.389
WOMAN: Tantalus colony
to Enterprise.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.390
We are unable to locate
one of our inmates.

04:19.492 --> 04:22.825
This is a potentially
violent case.

04:38.678 --> 04:41.374
WOMAN: Possibly hidden
in the box we beamed up to you.

04:41.481 --> 04:44.507
Repeat, unable to locate
one of our inmates.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.017
This is a potentially
violent case.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.883
Enterprise acknowledging.
Stand by.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.582
Security alert 3.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.886
Security alert, condition 3.

04:53.993 --> 04:57.019
All sections go
to alert condition 3.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.791
We may have an intruder aboard.

04:58.898 --> 05:02.425
Repeat, all sections
to alert condition 3.

05:02.535 --> 05:05.470
Intruder aboard.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.436
Hey. You're from engineering!

05:10.476 --> 05:12.569
Bridge--section C, deck 14.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.147
Captain, section C, deck 14,
reporting trouble.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.113
Someone in engineering uniform.

05:17.216 --> 05:19.241
Security control,
this is the bridge. Come in.

05:19.352 --> 05:22.913
I have them, Captain.
Closing off deck 14. Search in progress.

05:23.022 --> 05:24.956
[Klaxon wails]

05:25.058 --> 05:27.458
UHURA: Security alert,
condition 3.

05:31.097 --> 05:34.123
Approximately 6' 4" male,
early 40s.

05:34.233 --> 05:35.791
Approach with caution.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.733
This man's extremely dangerous.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.964
Repeat, approach
with extreme caution.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.233
Bridge out.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.899
Negative in
the deck area, Captain.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.340
He may have gotten out.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.639
Expanding search
to adjoining sections.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.941
Enterprise to Tantalus colony.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.448
MAN: Tantalus colony.
Adams here.

05:51.551 --> 05:54.179
Dr. Adams?
This is Captain Kirk.

05:54.287 --> 05:58.587
It appears we may have
an inmate of yours aboard the ship.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.522
Transporter crewman
found unconscious, Captain.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.924
Cargo case open and empty.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.792
Make that definite, Doctor.
He's aboard.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.455
ADAMS: Terribly sorry, Captain.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.296
I take all the blame.
Let me repeat,

06:09.402 --> 06:12.132
he's clever as well as
extremely violent.

06:12.238 --> 06:14.365
Take all possible precautions.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.465
We'll keep you posted, Doctor.
Kirk out.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.337
MAN: All sections,
security check in progress. Report.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.440
MAN: Forward phaser, affirmative.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.519
MAN: Phasers are
in good condition.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.815
This section's
operational ready.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.287
Interesting.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.791
Your Earth people
glorify organized violence

06:33.893 --> 06:35.451
for 40 centuries,

06:35.561 --> 06:39.190
but you imprison those
who employ it privately.

06:39.298 --> 06:42.790
And, of course,
your people found an answer.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.697
We disposed of emotion, Doctor.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.364
Where there is no emotion...

06:48.474 --> 06:50.567
there is no motive for violence.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.303
[Bridge doors open]

06:55.982 --> 06:57.973
Where's the captain?

07:01.087 --> 07:03.521
Which one of you
is the captain?

07:03.623 --> 07:04.885
I'm Captain Kirk.

07:16.636 --> 07:17.762
My name is...

07:20.807 --> 07:22.434
Van Gelder.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.007
I want asylum.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.410
At gunpoint?

07:31.851 --> 07:33.842
I want your promise first,

07:33.953 --> 07:36.285
your word that you won't
take me back there--

07:36.389 --> 07:38.186
to Tantalus.

07:55.842 --> 07:59.175
No promises.
Give me the weapon.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.269
No!

08:01.380 --> 08:02.813
VAN GELDER: No.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.884
No, I'm not going back!

08:05.985 --> 08:07.919
I'll disable your vessel first.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.578
You choose, Captain.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.281
I'll destroy your control panel.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.893
Take him to sick bay.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.597
Reverse course.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.970
Head back for Tantalus colony.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.115
McCOY: Abnormal, of course.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.912
But it's not schizophrenia,

08:40.019 --> 08:41.782
tissue damage,

08:41.888 --> 08:43.684
or any condition
I'm acquainted with, Jim.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.313
And you know,
after getting him here, it took

08:45.424 --> 08:47.324
almost a triple dose of sedative
to put him under.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.257
The report said
he was quite talkative.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.989
But not very informative.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.088
He claimed one thing,
then he seemed to forget,

08:53.199 --> 08:55.099
and then he'd start
to claim something else.

08:55.201 --> 08:59.763
But always with just the ring
of truth in it.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.136
I'd sure like
to study this one, Jim.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.469
Not our problem, Bones.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.547
You smart,
button-pushing brass hat.

09:08.648 --> 09:13.051
Wash your hands of it.
Is that your system?

09:13.152 --> 09:15.382
You're both quite
sure of yourselves, aren't you?

09:15.488 --> 09:16.853
Quite expert.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.150
Take him back.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.987
Let someone else
worry about him.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.626
What did you say
your name was?

09:24.730 --> 09:26.027
My name?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.558
My name is--aah!

09:33.439 --> 09:34.804
Simon...

09:37.610 --> 09:39.805
Van Gelder.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.016
I was the director of--

09:48.487 --> 09:50.216
director--

09:52.625 --> 09:55.856
at the Tantalus colony.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.825
You see what I mean?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.025
I was a graduate of...

10:02.134 --> 10:04.159
of...

10:04.270 --> 10:07.239
I was assistant to...

10:10.543 --> 10:13.706
Doctor...

10:13.813 --> 10:15.246
Aah!

10:15.348 --> 10:19.216
[Sobbing]

10:22.021 --> 10:24.751
I knew... I knew.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.556
But they've erased it.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.396
Erased?

10:32.498 --> 10:34.227
Edited...

10:34.333 --> 10:36.301
adjusted...

10:36.402 --> 10:38.802
subverted me.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.701
But I won't forget!

10:40.806 --> 10:42.398
I won't forget!

10:42.508 --> 10:43.600
You...

10:43.709 --> 10:45.802
you're so blind ignorant.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.640
You believe I belong
back there, don't you?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.237
Dead or alive.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.316
Well, I won't let
you take me back.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.044
I'm not going!

10:53.152 --> 10:55.279
I'll die first!
Do you hear?

10:55.388 --> 10:57.379
I'm not going!

10:57.490 --> 10:58.616
No!

10:58.724 --> 11:00.089
No!

11:00.192 --> 11:01.557
No.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.399
Estimated arrival
at Tantalus?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.478
57 minutes, 30 seconds, Captain.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.839
What's so fascinating?

11:23.949 --> 11:26.782
An identification tape
from our ship's library

11:26.886 --> 11:29.912
on Dr. Simon Van Gelder.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.512
Dr. Van Gelder?

11:31.624 --> 11:33.091
Dr. Van Gelder, Captain.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.591
No mistake.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.355
There's a full
l.D. tape on him.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.521
Committed to
Tantalus colony when?

11:38.631 --> 11:41.156
Assigned there six months ago

11:41.267 --> 11:43.201
as Dr. Adams' associate.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.500
Ship to surface,
Tantalus colony.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.599
UHURA: Hailing frequency's open, sir.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.475
U.S.S. Enterprise
to Tantalus colony.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.104
- WOMAN: Tantalus.
- This is Captain Kirk.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.946
- I'd like to speak to Dr. Adams.
- Stand by, Enterprise.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.452
Captain Kirk, Dr. Adams here.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.547
Dr. Adams, regarding
your escaped man--

12:05.658 --> 12:07.853
Is Dr. Van Gelder all right?

12:07.960 --> 12:10.360
And your people, no injuries?

12:10.463 --> 12:12.226
No casualties, sir.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.959
This man is...

12:15.067 --> 12:17.035
Dr. Simon Van Gelder?

12:17.136 --> 12:18.899
Yes, of course.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.995
You're certain he's all right?
We've been very concerned.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.665
In the violent state
he's in--

12:22.775 --> 12:24.367
No harm to him, sir.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.503
We thought you might enlighten us
as to his condition.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.979
He'd been doing some
experimental work, Captain,

12:30.082 --> 12:32.050
an experimental beam
we'd hoped

12:32.151 --> 12:34.551
might rehabilitate
incorrigibles.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.644
Van Gelder felt
he hadn't the moral right

12:36.756 --> 12:38.314
to expose another man
to something

12:38.424 --> 12:40.392
he hadn't tried
on his own person.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.653
Tragedy, Doctor.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.524
Jim...

12:43.629 --> 12:46.427
that doesn't quite ring true.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.064
Uh, Dr. Adams...

12:52.171 --> 12:53.934
please stand by.

12:54.039 --> 12:55.199
Explain.

12:57.176 --> 13:00.009
I don't believe him.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.910
I can't explain it, but
the more I study that patient--

13:03.015 --> 13:05.415
You don't believe him,
and you can't explain it.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.713
Bones, are you aware
that in the last 20 years,

13:07.820 --> 13:09.583
Dr. Adams has done more

13:09.688 --> 13:14.057
to revolutionize, to humanize prisons
and the treatment of prisoners...

13:14.160 --> 13:17.561
than all the rest of humanity
had done in 40 centuries?

13:17.663 --> 13:19.597
I've been to
those penal colonies

13:19.698 --> 13:21.689
since they've begun
following his methods,

13:21.801 --> 13:23.928
and they're not cages anymore.

13:24.036 --> 13:25.094
McCOY: Jim--

13:25.204 --> 13:28.298
They're clean, decent hospitals
for sick minds.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.465
Jim, listen!

13:29.575 --> 13:30.564
Gentlemen...

13:30.676 --> 13:32.735
I suggest you ask Dr. Adams

13:32.845 --> 13:34.938
if he wants Van Gelder returned.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.915
Dr. Adams...

13:47.026 --> 13:48.789
regarding Van Gelder...

13:48.894 --> 13:50.259
ADAMS: Yes, Captain.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.887
May I inquire about
your patrol destinations?

13:52.998 --> 13:55.262
Are you passing near
any hospital facilities

13:55.367 --> 13:57.164
superior to ours?

13:57.269 --> 13:58.793
I'd like Van Gelder to have

13:58.904 --> 14:00.929
the best possible treatment,
of course.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.769
Thank you, Doctor.

14:02.875 --> 14:06.777
I'll take it up with
the ship's surgeon. Stand by.

14:06.879 --> 14:09.245
Well, Bones,
you've got the ball.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.781
You care to recommend
a better place?

14:10.883 --> 14:13.909
There are no superior facilities.
He knows that.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.486
But that's not the question.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.681
If something unusual
is going on down there--

14:17.790 --> 14:19.314
An assumption, Doctor.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.155
I'm required to enter
any reasonable doubts

14:22.261 --> 14:23.626
into my medical log.

14:23.729 --> 14:26.323
That requires you
to answer in your log.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.968
Sorry, Jim.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.869
Dr. Adams...

14:41.981 --> 14:45.144
this is rather embarrassing.

14:45.251 --> 14:48.652
By strict interpretation
of our starship regulation,

14:48.754 --> 14:52.622
I'm required to initiate
an investigation of this

14:52.725 --> 14:54.283
so that a proper report--

14:54.393 --> 14:56.987
ADAMS: No need to apologize,
Captain Kirk.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.724
In fact, I'd take it
as a personal favor

14:59.832 --> 15:03.359
if you'd beam down
and look into it yourself.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.902
I'm sure you
realize we don't get

15:05.004 --> 15:06.369
too many visitors here.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.837
Oh, l, uh...

15:07.940 --> 15:09.339
Captain, I would appreciate it

15:09.441 --> 15:12.308
if you could come down
with a minimum staff.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.072
We're forced
to limit outside contact

15:14.179 --> 15:15.544
as much as possible.

15:15.648 --> 15:16.808
Affirmative, Doctor.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.316
I've visited
rehab colonies before.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.545
Enterprise out.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.248
Find me someone
in your department

15:24.356 --> 15:27.018
with psychiatric
and penology experience,

15:27.126 --> 15:28.218
if possible.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.524
Yes, sir.

15:47.012 --> 15:50.140
KIRK: Captain's log,
stardate 2715.2.

15:50.249 --> 15:51.341
Standard orbit,

15:51.450 --> 15:52.849
planet Tantalus 5.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.217
Mission: routine
investigation and report

15:56.322 --> 15:59.018
as per ship surgeon's medical log.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.058
As for my last entry,

16:01.160 --> 16:05.221
it seems I will get to meet
Dr. Adams at last.

16:05.331 --> 16:08.391
However, I would have preferred
other circumstances.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.938
Sick bay.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.699
Report, Doctor.

16:17.409 --> 16:20.776
Van Gelder's still
violently agitated, Captain.

16:20.879 --> 16:22.312
And you'd prefer to keep him here

16:22.414 --> 16:23.972
until I complete
my investigation anyway.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.880
I believe we should, Jim.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.920
Oh, I'm assigning
your technical aide, Captain.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.285
One of our psychiatrists
does have a background

16:31.390 --> 16:34.223
in rehabilitative
therapy--Dr. Noel,

16:34.326 --> 16:36.487
standing by
in the transporter room now.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.392
Thank you, Doctor.
Bridge out.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.429
Mr. Spock.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.067
Coordinates.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.667
Locked in, sir.
Ready to beam down.

17:01.086 --> 17:04.613
Dr. Helen Noel,
Captain. We've met.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.133
Don't you remember--

17:23.242 --> 17:24.675
the science lab
Christmas party?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.142
Yes, I remember.

17:26.244 --> 17:27.609
You dropped in--

17:27.713 --> 17:29.010
Yes, yes, I remember.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.877
Problem, Captain?

17:38.957 --> 17:40.322
Mr. Spock,

17:40.426 --> 17:42.394
you tell McCoy that
she had better check out

17:42.494 --> 17:44.485
as the best assistant
I ever had.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.935
Energize.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.802
Energize.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.018
In here, I presume, Doctor.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.892
Perhaps it would be simpler

18:18.997 --> 18:20.760
if you called me Helen,
Captain, since--

18:20.866 --> 18:22.663
This is another time,
another place,

18:22.768 --> 18:24.099
and another situation.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.501
Of course, Captain.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.833
Elevator...

18:31.944 --> 18:34.936
and going down quite a ways.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.345
I wouldn't recommend it
for weak hearts.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.591
Hello, Captain Kirk...

18:50.696 --> 18:51.788
and, uh...

18:51.897 --> 18:53.524
Dr. Helen Noel.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.600
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, sir.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.464
Thank you.
Thank you, Captain.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.560
Welcome to Devil's lsland, Doctor.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.639
Perhaps you'll
call me Helen, Doctor.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.537
With so many
titles around,

19:03.642 --> 19:05.610
we're not going to be sure
who's talking to who.

19:05.711 --> 19:06.871
I shall indeed. Won't you?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.537
Thank you.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.410
I believe regulations call
for me to check my weapon.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.711
No, no. That won't be necessary
in your case, Captain.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.786
Just keep it
out of sight, hmm?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.481
I know you people feel
as naked without a weapon

19:17.589 --> 19:20.080
as we do without a medikit.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.587
A small toast.
Do you mind?

19:24.696 --> 19:27.494
It's such a great day for us here
on Tantalus when we have visitors,

19:27.599 --> 19:29.157
no matter what the excuse.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.826
Doctor--

19:30.936 --> 19:32.927
Now, Captain, you made
your apology from upstairs.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.403
Now forget it.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.474
I don't think
you'll be able

19:36.575 --> 19:38.770
to get through
the security screen, Captain.

19:38.877 --> 19:40.845
Just a second, hmm?

19:40.946 --> 19:42.504
There. Now try it.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.172
Kirk to Enterprise.
Come in.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.841
Enterprise. Spock here.

19:45.951 --> 19:47.509
Your landing coordinates

19:47.619 --> 19:49.416
were right on the nose, Mr. Spock.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.852
We arrived safely,

19:50.956 --> 19:52.753
and we're here
with Dr. Adams right now.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.984
Kirk out.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.855
Affirmative, Captain.
Enterprise out.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.426
Ah, Lethe...

19:59.531 --> 20:00.930
come in.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.093
Lethe, this is Captain Kirk

20:04.203 --> 20:06.364
and Dr. Helen Noel.

20:06.471 --> 20:08.598
Lethe came to us
for rehabilitation

20:08.707 --> 20:10.675
and stayed on
as a therapist,

20:10.776 --> 20:12.971
and a very good one,
too, I might add.

20:13.078 --> 20:14.545
I love my work.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.051
Go right ahead, Captain.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.347
Before you came here...

20:22.454 --> 20:23.978
I was another person,

20:24.089 --> 20:26.319
malignant, hateful.

20:26.425 --> 20:28.620
May I ask what crime
you committed?

20:28.727 --> 20:31.127
Does it matter?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.289
That person no longer exists.

20:33.398 --> 20:37.357
Uh, part of our cure,
if you will, Captain,

20:37.469 --> 20:39.334
is to bury the past.

20:39.438 --> 20:42.373
Why should a person go on living
with unbearable memories

20:42.474 --> 20:44.237
if there's no necess--

20:44.343 --> 20:45.901
I feel quite sure

20:46.011 --> 20:49.037
that you'd concur with me
in that, Doctor--Helen.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.910
A shifting of memory patterns

20:51.016 --> 20:52.711
is basic to psychotherapy.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.018
Yes. And now
to the toast, hmm?

20:58.123 --> 21:00.318
You'll forgive us, Lethe.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.983
There you are, Captain.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.556
To all mankind...

21:06.665 --> 21:09.691
may we never
find space so vast,

21:09.801 --> 21:11.769
planets so cold,

21:11.870 --> 21:13.861
heart and mind so empty

21:13.972 --> 21:16.566
that we cannot fill them

21:16.675 --> 21:19.075
with love and warmth.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.681
Quite a tour, Doctor.
Very impressive.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.192
Thank you.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.626
Hi, Carl.

21:39.631 --> 21:40.962
Doctor.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.226
Yes?

21:44.002 --> 21:45.367
Hmm?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.028
Ah...

21:47.139 --> 21:49.539
I was afraid you would
ask about this, Captain.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.199
One doesn't like
to talk about

21:51.310 --> 21:52.868
their personal
failures, you know?

21:52.978 --> 21:54.536
It was just an experiment

21:54.646 --> 21:55.977
that went wrong, I'm afraid.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.639
May I see it?

21:57.749 --> 21:59.307
Captain, if something
hasn't worked out

21:59.418 --> 22:00.976
and therefore has
no scientific fact--

22:01.086 --> 22:02.644
Shall we leave it
up to the doctor?

22:02.754 --> 22:04.551
Since you brought me down here
for advice, Captain--

22:04.656 --> 22:06.624
One of the advantages
of being a captain, Doctor,

22:06.725 --> 22:08.283
is being able to ask for advice

22:08.393 --> 22:10.156
without necessarily
having to take it.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.457
I think I'll have to award
that round to the captain, Helen.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.555
You're fighting
over your weight.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.759
All right, let's take a look.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.601
SIMON: I'm not a criminal!

22:24.710 --> 22:26.644
I do not require...

22:28.413 --> 22:31.246
neural neutralizer.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.618
Neural neutralizer.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.623
Can you explain that,
Dr. Van Gelder?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.518
A room.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.490
A device.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.794
Door.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.163
Control panel.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.997
I see it.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.302
A device.

22:57.409 --> 23:00.207
A light! The light!

23:00.312 --> 23:01.301
This room--

23:01.413 --> 23:02.675
what happens there?

23:05.784 --> 23:07.513
Aah!

23:07.619 --> 23:10.213
Aah!

23:10.322 --> 23:13.348
Aah!

23:13.458 --> 23:16.894
Aah.

23:21.299 --> 23:23.164
A neural neutralizer--

23:23.268 --> 23:24.394
experimental.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.061
Actually, we don't expect

23:26.171 --> 23:28.401
to get much use
out of it at all.

23:28.507 --> 23:32.136
That beam from above
neutralizes brain waves.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.212
It relaxes the patient's mind.

23:34.312 --> 23:36.644
Does them no harm, of course,

23:36.748 --> 23:38.181
and the effects are only temporary.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.251
One question, Doctor.
If it doesn't do any good--

23:40.352 --> 23:43.185
Why do we go on using it?
Hmm, Captain?

23:43.288 --> 23:44.846
Hope.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.151
Yes, there's always
that slight chance

23:47.259 --> 23:49.227
that it might do some good

23:49.327 --> 23:51.318
in the more violent cases.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.398
Tranquillizers
are fine, Captain,

23:53.498 --> 23:55.489
but to continually
pump chemicals

23:55.600 --> 23:56.931
into a person's
bloodstream--

23:57.035 --> 23:58.434
Exactly my point,
Helen. Yes.

23:58.537 --> 23:59.595
Shall we?

24:05.177 --> 24:06.940
How does it work?

24:07.045 --> 24:08.603
Quite simple.

24:08.713 --> 24:10.704
Off/on switches,

24:10.816 --> 24:13.546
and the large control here
changes the strength

24:13.652 --> 24:15.517
of the brain neutralizing beam.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.780
Captain...

24:18.890 --> 24:21.757
you remind me
of the ancient skeptic

24:21.860 --> 24:24.886
who demanded
of the wise old sage

24:24.996 --> 24:27.089
to be taught all
the world's wisdom

24:27.199 --> 24:29.258
while standing on one foot.

24:29.367 --> 24:31.892
HELEN: Beam neutralizing
has been experimented with

24:32.003 --> 24:33.630
on Earth, Captain.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.729
I'm not acquainted with
this particular style of equipment,

24:35.841 --> 24:37.809
but I can assure you
that Dr. Adams

24:37.909 --> 24:39.900
has not created
a chamber of horrors here.

24:40.011 --> 24:42.809
I didn't mean
to suggest that he had.

24:42.914 --> 24:45.109
The reason I asked, sir,
was you haven't mentioned

24:45.217 --> 24:47.276
where Dr. Van Gelder's
injury occurred.

24:47.385 --> 24:48.909
Right here, Captain.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.749
Yes.

24:50.856 --> 24:53.256
Simon was a very stubborn man.

24:53.358 --> 24:56.156
He could've sat
in that room for years

24:56.261 --> 24:58.661
with the beam at that volume
or even higher.

24:58.763 --> 25:02.255
Or if he simply had
someone standing by

25:02.367 --> 25:04.301
to snap it off in case
he got into trouble, but...

25:04.402 --> 25:05.767
but no.

25:05.871 --> 25:09.329
He tried it alone
and on full volume.

25:10.909 --> 25:13.275
It's a pity.

25:20.452 --> 25:22.010
Thank you.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.988
You will forget
all you have heard.

25:31.096 --> 25:33.826
To remember
any portion of it,

25:33.932 --> 25:34.864
any word,

25:34.966 --> 25:37.025
will cause you pain,

25:37.135 --> 25:38.693
terrible pain,

25:38.803 --> 25:40.168
growing more terrible

25:40.272 --> 25:42.365
as you fight to remember.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.513
Can you give us
your present location, Captain?

25:53.618 --> 25:56.212
KIRK: ln Dr. Adams' study,
Mr. Spock. Why?

25:57.789 --> 26:00.189
Then you're
with Dr. Adams now.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.452
Affirmative.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.692
Captain...

26:07.799 --> 26:10.199
Van Gelder
has made reference

26:10.302 --> 26:12.702
to a particular
treatment room.

26:12.804 --> 26:15.568
The term was
neural neutralizer.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.699
Yes. He was injured there.
I've seen the room.

26:17.809 --> 26:20.004
Dr. Adams explained
the mistake Van Gelder made.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.008
Go ahead, Mr. Spock.
Anything further?

26:29.287 --> 26:31.255
Your Mr. Spock sounds like

26:31.356 --> 26:33.551
a very excellent second in command,
Captain Kirk.

26:33.658 --> 26:36.058
Please tell him to go ahead
and speak freely.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.755
I have to check in with
a member of my staff anyway.

26:38.863 --> 26:40.854
- Thank you, Dr. Adams.
- Excuse me.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.402
Stand by, Mr. Spock.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.434
Dr. Adams has left
with some things to attend to.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.203
What is it, Mr. Spock?

26:52.310 --> 26:54.835
Van Gelder is extremely
agitated, Captain,

26:54.946 --> 26:56.538
and warns that
you are in danger.

26:56.648 --> 26:58.172
Well, that's foolish!

26:58.283 --> 27:00.046
SPOCK: Uh, please
repeat, Captain.

27:00.151 --> 27:01.709
I didn't receive that.

27:01.820 --> 27:04.414
Tell McCoy the technical expert
he sent along with me

27:04.522 --> 27:06.285
insists that
any concern is...

27:06.391 --> 27:07.949
unjustified.

27:08.059 --> 27:12.359
According to Adams,
Van Gelder created his own problem.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.058
He's suffering from
neuro-synapse damage,

27:15.166 --> 27:17.134
as if his brain
were short-circuited.

27:17.235 --> 27:19.635
It's no wonder
he's having delusions.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.036
McCoy here.
Received and understood.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.438
But we still have some doubts
up here, Captain.

27:24.542 --> 27:27.136
Can you tell us any more?

27:27.245 --> 27:28.610
Not really.

27:28.713 --> 27:32.376
SPOCK: When do you plan
to beam back up, Captain?

27:32.484 --> 27:35.976
I...think we'll spend
the night here, Mr. Spock.

27:36.087 --> 27:38.612
No! No.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.281
No, no.

27:40.392 --> 27:45.056
And you will continue
to check in every four hours?

27:45.163 --> 27:47.290
Affirmative. Kirk out.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.832
No! No.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.730
No, don't let them!

27:50.835 --> 27:53.895
You must warn your captain.
No! No!

27:54.005 --> 27:56.565
Don't let him stay!
Don't let him stay!

27:56.675 --> 27:58.006
Don't!

27:58.109 --> 27:59.474
No. No.

27:59.577 --> 28:03.240
Don't hypo me.
Please don't hypo me.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.340
I'll try not to fight.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.442
I'll try.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.521
But you must listen.

28:12.290 --> 28:15.123
Warn your captain. Dr. Adams...

28:17.095 --> 28:18.653
Doc...

28:18.763 --> 28:21.994
Dr. Adams...

28:22.100 --> 28:23.658
will destroy.

28:23.768 --> 28:24.928
Destroy how?

28:25.036 --> 28:26.162
What?

28:30.041 --> 28:32.441
Right...

28:32.544 --> 28:35.342
death.

28:50.595 --> 28:51.994
SPOCK: Enterprise log.

28:52.097 --> 28:54.429
First officer Spock,
acting captain.

28:54.532 --> 28:57.592
I must now use
an ancient Vulcan technique

28:57.702 --> 29:00.466
to probe into
Van Gelder's tortured mind.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.563
Spock, if there's
the slightest possibility

29:02.674 --> 29:03.800
it might help--

29:03.908 --> 29:05.671
I've never used it
on a human, Doctor.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.768
If there's any way we can
look into this man's mind

29:07.879 --> 29:09.847
to see if what he's seeing
is real or delusion--

29:09.948 --> 29:13.179
It's a hidden, personal thing
to the Vulcan people,

29:13.284 --> 29:15.275
part of our private lives.

29:15.386 --> 29:17.354
Now look, Spock,

29:17.455 --> 29:20.481
Jim Kirk could be
in real trouble.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.583
Will it work or not?

29:35.807 --> 29:38.002
It could be dangerous.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.509
Do you understand?

29:40.612 --> 29:43.012
It requires I make
pressure changes...

29:43.114 --> 29:44.672
in your nerves,

29:44.783 --> 29:46.216
your blood vessels.

29:46.317 --> 29:49.684
You must open my mind.

29:49.788 --> 29:54.054
Let me warn you
and explain to you.

29:54.159 --> 29:56.889
This will not
affect you, Dr. McCoy,

29:56.995 --> 29:59.293
only the person I touch.

29:59.397 --> 30:00.955
It is not hypnosis.

30:01.065 --> 30:02.157
I understand.

30:24.589 --> 30:25.749
McCOY: Good.

30:25.857 --> 30:27.916
The reading's levelling.

30:30.461 --> 30:33.692
You'll begin to feel
a strange euphoria.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.369
Your body...

30:45.476 --> 30:47.034
floats.

30:49.013 --> 30:54.781
Yes. I begin to feel it.

30:54.886 --> 30:56.615
Open your mind.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.186
We move together.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.923
Our minds sharing

31:04.028 --> 31:06.553
the same thoughts.

31:06.664 --> 31:08.529
[Door buzzes]

31:11.536 --> 31:13.094
Good evening.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.762
Good evening.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.636
What did you think
of the inmates

31:16.741 --> 31:18.538
we saw here
this afternoon?

31:18.643 --> 31:21.237
You could've waited until tomorrow
morning to ask me that, Captain.

31:21.346 --> 31:22.711
I didn't.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.942
I thought they were
happy, well-adjusted.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.143
But a bit blank.

31:28.253 --> 31:31.154
Captain, if you're questioning the
methods of a man like Tristan Adams--

31:31.256 --> 31:33.019
I'd like to see
that treatment room again.

31:33.124 --> 31:35.957
You say you're somewhat familiar
with the theory behind it?

31:36.060 --> 31:39.996
Yes, somewhat. But if you'd simply state
any doubts you have to Dr. Adams--

31:40.098 --> 31:42.931
And if he's lying, he'll continue
to lie, and I won't find out a thing.

31:43.034 --> 31:45.229
The only way I can be sure
is to see that machine at work.

31:45.336 --> 31:47.099
Or is that too impractical

31:47.205 --> 31:48.968
and unscientific of me, Doctor?

31:54.512 --> 31:56.070
Well?

31:56.180 --> 31:57.511
Coming.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.109
What is our name?

32:04.289 --> 32:06.086
Who are we?

32:08.893 --> 32:12.294
We are Simon Van Gelder.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.264
Dr. Adams...

32:15.366 --> 32:17.527
the neural neutralizer.

32:19.737 --> 32:21.932
What did he do to us?

32:24.742 --> 32:28.041
He can reshape
any mind he chooses.

32:30.081 --> 32:34.017
He used it
to erase our memories,

32:34.118 --> 32:36.484
put his own thoughts there.

32:39.557 --> 32:42.788
He was surprised
it took so much power.

32:44.762 --> 32:46.730
We fought him, remember?

32:49.767 --> 32:51.962
But we grew so tired.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.538
Our minds so blank...

32:56.641 --> 32:58.734
so open...

32:58.843 --> 33:00.902
SIMON: that any thought
he placed there

33:01.012 --> 33:03.640
became our thoughts.

33:03.748 --> 33:07.377
Our minds so empty...

33:07.485 --> 33:09.680
Iike a sponge,

33:09.787 --> 33:11.550
needing thoughts,

33:11.656 --> 33:13.647
begging.

33:13.758 --> 33:14.884
Empty.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.891
Loneliness.

33:18.997 --> 33:24.060
So lonely to be sitting there empty...

33:24.168 --> 33:27.831
wanting any word from him.

33:29.374 --> 33:30.932
Love.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.407
Yes.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.068
Hate.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.543
Yes.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.204
Live.

33:37.315 --> 33:38.680
Yes.

33:38.783 --> 33:39.909
Die.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.383
Yes.

33:41.486 --> 33:47.015
Such agony to be empty.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.717
Empty.

33:48.826 --> 33:50.760
Lonely.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.420
Lonely.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.521
So empty.

33:54.632 --> 33:57.226
Empty.

33:57.335 --> 33:59.929
So empty.

34:02.106 --> 34:04.097
KIRK: I have no desire
to damage my brain.

34:04.208 --> 34:08.076
Can this be handled
with reasonable safety? Yes or no?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.737
Yes.

34:09.847 --> 34:11.815
And will you be able to determine

34:11.916 --> 34:13.907
if that beam is harming me
in the slightest?

34:14.018 --> 34:15.576
Yes, Captain.

34:15.686 --> 34:17.244
I know my profession.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.163
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

34:34.272 --> 34:36.001
We'll try minimum intensity--

34:36.107 --> 34:37.665
a second or two.

34:46.551 --> 34:49.246
Anytime you're ready,
Doctor, just for a second or two.

34:49.353 --> 34:53.516
We already tried it
for that long, Captain.

34:53.623 --> 34:56.889
- Nothing happened.
- Something happened.

34:56.994 --> 34:58.552
Your face went completely blank.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.463
Try a...

35:01.566 --> 35:03.761
harmless suggestion.

35:12.043 --> 35:12.975
You're hungry.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.342
You know, when we finally
get through this,

35:18.449 --> 35:21.179
I'd like to locate and
raid a kitchen somewhere.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.846
I put that suggestion
in your mind, Captain.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.551
I said simply
that you were hungry.

35:31.829 --> 35:33.558
Remarkably effective
for a device

35:33.664 --> 35:35.962
that Dr. Adams
was going to abandon.

35:36.067 --> 35:38.365
I think we should
try this again.

35:38.469 --> 35:42.200
Yes. Pick something unusual,
an unusual suggestion,

35:42.306 --> 35:44.331
something we can
both be sure of.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.815
At the Christmas party...

35:53.918 --> 35:55.681
we met.

35:55.786 --> 35:57.549
We danced.

35:57.655 --> 36:00.089
You talked about the stars.

36:01.392 --> 36:04.691
I suggest now that
it happened in a different way.

36:04.795 --> 36:07.992
You swept me off my feet

36:08.099 --> 36:09.760
and carried me to your cabin.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.438
[Laughing]

36:14.539 --> 36:16.097
Merry Christmas.

36:16.207 --> 36:19.665
Captain, if your crew
saw you carry me here...

36:19.777 --> 36:21.938
My crew...

36:22.046 --> 36:25.914
is sworn to secrecy.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.417
But my reputation...

36:28.519 --> 36:31.750
I mean, just having
met like this.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.221
Of course...

36:33.324 --> 36:35.724
it would be different
if you cared for me.

36:39.363 --> 36:42.389
You want me
to manufacture a lie,

36:42.500 --> 36:44.468
wrap it up as a...

36:44.569 --> 36:46.127
Christmas present for you?

36:47.905 --> 36:49.270
No.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.364
I'd prefer honesty.

37:13.331 --> 37:15.322
Now Captain Kirk is going to have

37:15.433 --> 37:17.628
a complete demonstration.

37:17.735 --> 37:21.569
I want there to be
no doubts whatsoever in his mind.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.009
Mmm.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.578
You're madly in love
with Helen, Captain.

37:30.681 --> 37:33.912
You'd lie, cheat,
steal for her,

37:34.018 --> 37:36.578
sacrifice your career,
your reputation.

37:36.687 --> 37:37.676
No, Doctor! No!

37:39.390 --> 37:41.790
The pain--do you
feel it, Captain?

37:41.892 --> 37:45.328
You must have her,
or the pain grows worse,

37:45.429 --> 37:47.590
the pain,
the longing for her.

37:47.698 --> 37:49.598
Helen.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.032
For years, you've
loved her, Captain,

37:52.136 --> 37:53.262
for years.

37:53.371 --> 37:55.703
For years, I've loved you.

37:55.806 --> 37:57.797
You must continue
to remember that, Captain.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.344
And now...she's gone.

38:04.749 --> 38:05.977
Helen.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.344
Helen, don't go!

38:11.122 --> 38:14.057
I need you, Helen!

38:14.158 --> 38:15.625
Now, Captain...

38:15.726 --> 38:17.694
you must take
your phaser weapon

38:17.795 --> 38:19.786
and drop it on the floor.

38:27.171 --> 38:30.334
Captain, the pain increases
unless you obey me.

38:31.842 --> 38:33.332
I...

38:33.444 --> 38:34.968
must...

38:36.347 --> 38:37.712
drop it.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.373
[Crash]

38:39.483 --> 38:41.474
Very good, Captain.

38:41.585 --> 38:43.348
Very good indeed.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.684
And now your communicator.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.257
Drop it on the floor.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.169
Kirk to Enterprise.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.944
KIRK: Uhh!

39:09.046 --> 39:10.877
Kirk...

39:12.216 --> 39:13.581
to Enterprise.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.278
Aah!

39:16.387 --> 39:17.445
No!

39:17.555 --> 39:20.217
[Sobbing]

39:31.569 --> 39:33.434
They've taken you
from the room, Captain.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.437
You're in your own quarters now.

39:36.774 --> 39:37.900
Helen...

39:39.510 --> 39:42.968
Helen, for years,
I've loved you.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.273
- Helen...
- Try to remember.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.680
I've loved you.

39:46.784 --> 39:48.718
- He placed all that in your mind.
- For years.

39:48.819 --> 39:49.786
Remember.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.445
Dr. Adams took the controls

39:51.555 --> 39:52.920
away from me.

39:53.023 --> 39:55.014
Do you remember the pain

39:55.126 --> 39:57.890
and then his voice?
Remember?

39:59.697 --> 40:02.188
Yes.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.897
Yes.

40:08.472 --> 40:11.066
I...

40:11.175 --> 40:12.472
remember.

40:14.378 --> 40:16.710
I...

40:16.814 --> 40:18.304
remember.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.042
Helen.

40:33.497 --> 40:35.658
Look.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.757
The duct.

40:40.571 --> 40:41.936
The duct.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.910
Uhh.

40:51.015 --> 40:52.778
Give me a hand here.

40:52.883 --> 40:54.009
Pull.

40:58.689 --> 41:01.089
KIRK: Air conditioning.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.352
It has to connect

41:02.460 --> 41:03.825
with other ducts and tunnels.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.486
You can get through this.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.154
It might lead
to the power supply.

41:07.264 --> 41:08.629
Short-circuited,

41:08.732 --> 41:12.463
it would cut off
the security force field.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.538
Have you had any training
in hyper-power circuits?

41:14.638 --> 41:15.696
No.

41:18.108 --> 41:19.871
Megavoltage.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.810
Touch the wrong line,
and you're dead.

41:22.913 --> 41:25.939
Anything's better than
Adams' treatment room.

41:33.123 --> 41:34.886
Time for another
treatment?

41:44.768 --> 41:47.202
ADAMS: Please don't
fight me, Captain.

41:47.304 --> 41:49.704
The pain only gets worse
when you doubt me.

41:51.475 --> 41:53.033
Uhh.

41:54.612 --> 41:55.874
Uhh.

41:55.980 --> 41:59.074
Uhh!

41:59.183 --> 42:01.481
You believe in me completely.

42:01.585 --> 42:03.143
I believe in you.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.745
You trust me completely.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.187
I...

42:08.492 --> 42:09.686
trust you.

42:09.793 --> 42:12.091
Excellent, Captain.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.424
I compliment you.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.556
Do you know
Dr. Van Gelder

42:15.666 --> 42:20.069
was down on his hands and knees
sobbing at this point?

42:20.170 --> 42:21.831
It was so gratifying.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.931
I'm so fortunate to have had
a couple of excellent specimens

42:25.042 --> 42:26.703
to--to work with.

42:26.810 --> 42:29.335
I've learned a great deal.

42:29.446 --> 42:31.004
The woman doctor--

42:31.115 --> 42:32.673
she's gone, Dr. Adams.

42:32.783 --> 42:34.751
Notify security
at once, Lethe.

42:36.287 --> 42:38.084
Where is she, Captain?

42:38.188 --> 42:40.349
I...

42:40.457 --> 42:41.856
Uhh!

42:41.959 --> 42:43.722
I don't know.

42:43.827 --> 42:45.454
Where is Helen?

42:45.563 --> 42:49.158
And with what instructions?

42:49.266 --> 42:51.564
Uhh.

42:51.669 --> 42:53.466
Uhh.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.732
I...

42:55.839 --> 42:57.272
don't...

42:57.374 --> 42:59.274
know.

43:40.651 --> 43:42.482
Emergency channel D.

43:42.586 --> 43:45.453
It's no good, Mr. Spock.
I can't break through their force field.

43:45.556 --> 43:46.284
Keep trying.

44:37.541 --> 44:41.500
Put him back in the chair,
Eli, and find that girl.

44:41.612 --> 44:42.772
Aah!

45:08.238 --> 45:09.068
Mr. Spock, the force field is gone.

45:09.973 --> 45:11.964
I can send you right
to the source of the interruption.

45:12.076 --> 45:14.044
Get some security people
and follow me down.

45:17.081 --> 45:18.070
Energize.

45:56.286 --> 45:57.617
Enterprise, this is Spock.

45:57.721 --> 45:59.518
Force field
has been eliminated.

46:25.349 --> 46:27.078
Captain.

46:28.318 --> 46:30.343
Captain?

46:35.058 --> 46:36.821
Helen, are you all right?

46:36.927 --> 46:37.894
Yes.

46:40.063 --> 46:42.088
This isn't right, Captain.

46:43.734 --> 46:45.964
Dr. Adams did this to you.

46:46.069 --> 46:47.593
KIRK: Dr. Adams?

46:49.940 --> 46:52.067
Dr. Ad...

46:52.176 --> 46:54.144
The treatment room.
Follow me.

47:01.351 --> 47:02.079
Jim!

47:14.264 --> 47:15.925
The power came on.

47:16.033 --> 47:18.365
He's dead, Captain.

47:18.468 --> 47:22.495
The machine wasn't on
high enough to kill him.

47:22.606 --> 47:23.971
But he was alone.

47:25.742 --> 47:27.710
Can you imagine
the mind...

47:27.811 --> 47:29.278
emptied by that thing?

47:32.816 --> 47:36.274
Without even
a tormentor for company.

47:36.386 --> 47:37.785
I understand.

48:05.315 --> 48:07.306
MAN: All sections,
security check.

48:07.417 --> 48:08.975
Report.

48:17.828 --> 48:19.625
Oh, Captain,

48:19.730 --> 48:22.130
there was a message
from Tantalus colony, sir.

48:22.232 --> 48:24.166
It was from Van Gelder.

48:24.268 --> 48:26.896
He thought you'd like to know
the treatment room had been dismantled

48:27.004 --> 48:29.199
and the equipment destroyed.

48:30.974 --> 48:32.703
Thank you.

48:43.620 --> 48:46.589
It's hard to believe that
a man could die of loneliness.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.994
Not when you've sat in that room.

49:02.306 --> 49:04.866
Take us out
of orbit, Mr. Spock.

49:04.975 --> 49:06.738
Ahead warp factor 1.

49:06.843 --> 49:08.606
Acknowledged, Captain.

49:08.712 --> 49:10.179
Warp factor 1.
