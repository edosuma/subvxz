00:08.927 --> 00:10.406
- Tom...
- What?

00:10.408 --> 00:12.693
- Just feel it, please.
- I've already touched it.

00:12.696 --> 00:14.593
- Well, what do you think it is?
- I don't know.

00:14.594 --> 00:16.433
- Do you think it's cancer?
- I doubt it.

00:16.434 --> 00:19.033
But I don't want to say it's
not, just in case it is.

00:19.034 --> 00:21.393
- Josh, can you feel it, please?
- No, I just could never.

00:21.394 --> 00:23.353
I don't really want him
to touch it either.

00:23.354 --> 00:25.153
I think I just saw Geoffrey.

00:25.154 --> 00:27.433
You always think you're
seeing Geoffrey, but you're not.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.513
- Guys, I could be dying!
- Oh, you wish.

00:29.514 --> 00:31.873
- You're not dying!
- Josh, feel it!

00:31.874 --> 00:33.913
He doesn't know what breasts
are meant to feel like.

00:33.914 --> 00:35.593
- Absolutely never.
- It's Josh and Tom.

00:35.594 --> 00:37.593
It was Geoffrey! Hey.

00:37.594 --> 00:38.993
Hi.

01:27.584 --> 01:29.063
Do you want me to choke
you or something?

01:29.064 --> 01:30.544
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.703
- Is that right?
- Just shut up.

01:37.104 --> 01:39.103
It's just... it's just I'm
worried I'm hurting you.

01:39.104 --> 01:40.584
But, no, that's the point. Okay.

01:53.464 --> 01:55.583
What are you reading
about in the newspaper?

01:55.584 --> 01:56.904
The Middle East.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.783
Don't you think instead it'd be fun
to, like, just be cute with me?

02:01.784 --> 02:03.784
Just let me finish.

02:05.504 --> 02:07.143
It's just, um... it's just

02:07.144 --> 02:09.103
I really feel like I need some
attention from you right now.

02:09.104 --> 02:11.144
- Josh, I'm busy.
- Okay.

02:12.704 --> 02:14.464
I'll just entertain myself.

02:44.784 --> 02:45.944
Sorry. No, I'm sorry.

02:45.945 --> 02:48.503
Is this distracting you from
pretending that it's the olden days

02:48.504 --> 02:50.023
and that you're a grandparent

02:50.024 --> 02:52.663
and that you're, like, wearing
a monocle and eating jellied eel?

02:52.664 --> 02:54.943
Because nobody reads the
newspaper anymore, okay,

02:54.944 --> 02:56.423
because we have the internet now.

02:56.424 --> 02:58.823
And also, this newspaper
is all biased and stupid and...

03:00.864 --> 03:01.864
Geoffrey?

03:03.144 --> 03:06.023
Geoffrey? Geoffrey,
I asked you a question.

03:06.024 --> 03:08.304
- What do you want?
- I just want you to hold me.

03:19.144 --> 03:22.023
I always just assumed
this is how tired everyone was.

03:22.024 --> 03:24.743
But now I think maybe
it's just because I'm sick.

03:24.744 --> 03:26.743
- You don't have cancer!
- Oh, my God!

03:26.744 --> 03:28.983
Desperate for me not to have cancer.

03:28.984 --> 03:31.863
What? Yeah. I am desperate for you
not to have cancer.

03:31.864 --> 03:34.023
You're gonna break up with me
because I have cancer.

03:34.024 --> 03:36.623
It is so mean of you
to think that I would do that.

03:36.624 --> 03:38.743
- I'm too tired to argue, Tom.
- Fine.

03:38.744 --> 03:40.303
But you're not tired from cancer.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.784
You don't know that.

03:54.504 --> 03:56.463
- Hannah.
- Oh.

03:56.464 --> 03:57.584
Whoa!

03:57.585 --> 03:59.503
That table came out of
nowhere, didn't it?

03:59.504 --> 04:01.103
It really wasn't looking
where it was goin'.

04:01.104 --> 04:03.343
That's fine. Thanks.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.663
You look lovely. Very expensive.

04:05.664 --> 04:07.223
- I've got tenure.
- Oh.

04:07.224 --> 04:08.623
- You look really good.
- Thank you.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.583
I've, er, got posture.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.264
You've been on my mind
a lot lately, Hannah.

04:14.584 --> 04:16.303
I can't believe you wrote
a letter to my mum.

04:16.303 --> 04:17.543
She wasn't that fond of you.

04:17.543 --> 04:19.103
Well, it was the only
way I could find you.

04:19.103 --> 04:21.262
You're not on social media.
You almost don't exist.

04:21.264 --> 04:22.744
I know.

04:24.224 --> 04:25.903
Um, are you sick?

04:25.904 --> 04:28.103
No. No, I don't think so.

04:28.104 --> 04:30.984
So not sick. Have you joined AA?

04:32.304 --> 04:33.983
Are you trying to think of
all the negative reasons

04:33.984 --> 04:35.743
why I might get back
in contact with you?

04:35.744 --> 04:37.583
Yeah. Well, we didn't end well.

04:37.584 --> 04:39.783
Yeah. It was brutal.

04:39.784 --> 04:41.503
It was the prequel to Fury Road

04:41.504 --> 04:43.463
where we find out how
Charlize Theron lost her arm.

04:43.464 --> 04:46.264
You were Charlize Theron's
arm to me, Hannah.

04:47.704 --> 04:51.663
The bit that was left or
the mechanical claw bit?

04:53.784 --> 04:55.704
See? You still make me laugh.

04:57.184 --> 04:59.143
I live in a caravan. I don't have a job.

04:59.144 --> 05:01.624
I still hate myself so much I
want to hit myself with a hammer.

05:04.144 --> 05:06.463
But I can do three push-ups.

05:06.464 --> 05:07.944
That's great.

05:09.584 --> 05:11.423
I missed you, John.

05:11.424 --> 05:13.543
He has this new-found
sense of independence.

05:13.544 --> 05:15.703
Sometimes he sits
in rooms alone without me.

05:15.704 --> 05:18.743
- And I'm just... I'm shattered.
- He really snuggled me last night.

05:18.744 --> 05:20.303
I think he remembers me.

05:20.304 --> 05:22.663
Nah, he just does
that when he's cold.

05:22.664 --> 05:24.303
Sorry. No, yeah, yeah.

05:24.304 --> 05:27.063
No, definitely, he misses you.
He loves you. Yeah, definitely.

05:27.064 --> 05:29.503
He's being... he's being
extraordinarily sweet.

05:29.504 --> 05:30.743
Yeah.

05:30.744 --> 05:33.024
He definitely doesn't look
at the other boys like that.

05:38.904 --> 05:39.944
Whoa.

05:41.304 --> 05:42.384
Ella?

05:42.385 --> 05:43.904
Hi.

05:45.104 --> 05:46.824
Oop!

05:49.624 --> 05:51.184
Come on through.

06:07.224 --> 06:08.224
Ta-da!

06:08.638 --> 06:10.677
Solar hot-water system.

06:11.584 --> 06:13.783
- You shower out here?
- No, I shower at the gym.

06:13.784 --> 06:16.383
- That is a hose.
- Okay.

06:16.384 --> 06:19.103
Look, I put up fairy lights.

06:19.104 --> 06:20.583
I'm sure they're pretty in the dark.

06:20.584 --> 06:23.943
Yeah, I really feel like I'm finally
catching up with the Kardashians.

06:23.944 --> 06:25.543
That's one fine caravan.

06:25.544 --> 06:27.143
Would you like to see inside the palace?

06:27.144 --> 06:28.984
Sure. Let's do this.

06:30.144 --> 06:31.823
Ladies first.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.104
I'm a lady.

06:37.944 --> 06:40.623
Mmm, no, no, no, no. Not every time.

06:40.624 --> 06:42.223
But I've been googling how.

06:42.224 --> 06:44.063
You're really not very good
at being dominant, are you?

06:44.064 --> 06:47.063
Okay. Take that back, you sissy!

06:51.064 --> 06:52.983
You can't fight me.
Obviously you're stronger than me.

06:52.984 --> 06:54.423
- Oh, yeah.
- Pretend.

06:59.104 --> 07:01.743
Never had a doctor
the same age as me before.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.904
Just lift your arm for me.

07:06.264 --> 07:07.623
Thank you.

07:07.624 --> 07:09.823
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, sorry. It's fine.

07:09.824 --> 07:11.343
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

07:11.344 --> 07:12.823
- Okay.
- I'm good.

07:12.824 --> 07:14.903
It's all good. All good here.

07:27.024 --> 07:28.823
Oi.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.863
I forgot. I don't have any gas.

07:30.864 --> 07:33.623
I can't offer you tea.
I've got water or milk.

07:33.624 --> 07:35.943
I've got milk. Look, in tiny buckets.

07:35.944 --> 07:37.424
Good.

07:38.864 --> 07:40.743
You know, when you said that
you were living in a caravan,

07:40.744 --> 07:43.344
you know... I kind of
thought you were joking.

07:44.344 --> 07:46.423
Well, it's both true
and a joke, isn't it?

07:46.424 --> 07:50.023
It's like... this is a joke.
My life is a joke.

07:50.024 --> 07:52.583
- No, it's not.
- Yeah.

07:52.584 --> 07:54.903
Methinks you might want
to make your exit now.

07:54.904 --> 07:57.423
No, I don't want to leave,
actually, as it happens.

07:57.424 --> 07:59.824
Yeah, you do. Remember, old habits?

08:00.824 --> 08:03.583
- You like to leave me.
- Hannah, you're over-thinking this.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.423
Well, how much is enough think?

08:05.424 --> 08:06.903
You know, I don't want to under-think.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.384
You've given it adequate think.

08:10.544 --> 08:12.624
- Come here.
- Over there, to you?

08:16.224 --> 08:18.344
- I want to kiss you.
- Gosh.

08:31.064 --> 08:32.543
What the hell are you doing?

08:32.544 --> 08:35.543
Like, look at you.
You're winning at life.

08:35.544 --> 08:40.023
Look at me. I'm not just losing,
I'm not even playing anymore.

08:40.024 --> 08:42.183
You being here doesn't make any sense.

08:43.464 --> 08:46.984
No, you being here doesn't
make any sense, Hannah.

08:48.544 --> 08:51.183
When we met, you were the winner.

08:51.184 --> 08:53.343
I wouldn't be winning...

08:53.344 --> 08:55.944
this winnerly, if it wasn't for you.

08:57.064 --> 08:58.543
What good is being the winner if...

08:58.544 --> 09:00.463
- Chicken dinner.
- What?

09:00.464 --> 09:02.664
Yeah, no idea. I regret saying that.

09:14.144 --> 09:15.664
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

09:17.464 --> 09:20.103
Was it okay? What did he say?
Was it bad news?

09:20.104 --> 09:23.023
- It's just fibroadenoma.
- Is that good?

09:23.024 --> 09:25.023
Yeah, it's just, like, fibrous tissue.

09:25.024 --> 09:26.703
It just means that I'm
probably getting my period.

09:26.704 --> 09:28.583
- It's not cancer?
- Not cancer.

09:28.584 --> 09:30.664
Fibroadenoma. High five! Okay!

09:33.264 --> 09:35.184
He was so young for a doctor.

09:37.104 --> 09:39.343
Did you like it when he
touched your boobies?

09:39.344 --> 09:41.824
No, Tom. I was too
worried about my cancer.

09:43.464 --> 09:45.023
Wasn't just young, though, was he?

09:45.024 --> 09:48.823
He was, like, a full babe.
Like a model but educated.

09:48.824 --> 09:50.823
I wish he'd touched my boobies.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.184
- He was a dream.
- Mmm. I don't know.

09:54.744 --> 09:56.383
What do you mean you don't know?

09:56.384 --> 09:58.103
Everyone knows.

09:58.104 --> 10:00.784
Nothing's ever been more clear
than that guy's dreaminess.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.783
- What?
- What?

10:05.784 --> 10:08.943
You're just looking at me
like I'm in love with him.

10:08.944 --> 10:10.943
Whoa! Whoa.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.143
Absolutely at no point

10:13.144 --> 10:15.743
was I thinking you were
in love with that doctor.

10:15.744 --> 10:17.744
Okay. Okay.

10:21.024 --> 10:23.023
So, what's next in store for you?

10:23.024 --> 10:25.023
- What do you mean?
- Like, what's next?

10:25.024 --> 10:26.983
- What's your plan?
- I'm meant to have a plan?

10:26.984 --> 10:28.223
Yes.

10:28.224 --> 10:29.623
I'm...

10:29.624 --> 10:31.543
Shit, I don't know. What's
next in store for you?

10:31.544 --> 10:34.623
I've really been trying
to self-improve lately.

10:34.624 --> 10:37.863
I lost track for a while, if
I'm honest, but I'm focused.

10:37.864 --> 10:39.343
I'm ready to focus.

10:39.344 --> 10:40.863
What are you focusing on?

10:40.864 --> 10:43.824
I'm focusing on trying to get back
to the truest version of myself.

10:44.824 --> 10:46.983
Is this not the truest
version of yourself?

10:46.984 --> 10:48.823
I don't think you've
ever really known me

10:48.824 --> 10:50.583
as the truest version of myself.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.263
Okay, but you just said you
were trying to improve,

10:52.264 --> 10:54.583
so how do you know that getting back
to your truest version of yourself

10:54.584 --> 10:56.063
is gonna be an improvement?

10:56.064 --> 10:58.743
Oh, wow!

10:58.744 --> 11:01.063
- I should not be here anymore.
- Why?

11:01.064 --> 11:02.423
Do you not think there's a discord

11:02.424 --> 11:04.263
between your personality
and my personality?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.823
Yes.

11:05.824 --> 11:06.824
- Right?
- Yeah.

11:06.825 --> 11:08.703
Yeah, we should absolutely
stop this while we're ahead.

11:08.704 --> 11:10.264
Absolutely!

11:12.344 --> 11:13.823
It's just weird that you would presume

11:13.824 --> 11:15.303
that I thought you were into the doctor.

11:15.304 --> 11:17.183
Can't you just be happy
that I don't have cancer?

11:17.184 --> 11:19.383
Did you say anything to him
that wasn't about your lump?

11:19.384 --> 11:20.863
I don't even remember.

11:20.864 --> 11:24.143
I think I said, "It's weird having a
doctor who's the same age as you."

11:24.144 --> 11:26.023
Ho-ho!

11:26.024 --> 11:27.863
That's the flirtiest
comment I've ever heard.

11:27.864 --> 11:29.463
Oh, my God!

11:29.464 --> 11:33.383
Okay, fine. Yeah, he was hot.
That was entertaining.

11:33.384 --> 11:35.423
Imagine if you had a hot
doctor touching your body.

11:35.424 --> 11:37.303
My doctor's the same gender as me.

11:37.304 --> 11:38.783
Well, thanks to the patriarchy,

11:38.784 --> 11:41.143
the majority of doctors available
at short notice are men.

11:41.144 --> 11:42.983
I hate it when you blame the patriarchy.

11:42.984 --> 11:44.463
What can I possibly say now

11:44.464 --> 11:46.423
that's not going to
sound patriarchy-ish?

11:49.704 --> 11:51.183
- Hey!
- Josh.

11:51.184 --> 11:54.303
- Do you have cancer?
- No. I have fibroadenoma.

11:54.304 --> 11:57.303
Sweet, sweet. Fibroadenoma!

11:57.304 --> 12:00.503
I choked Geoffrey. Yep, he asked
me to choke him, so I did it.

12:00.504 --> 12:02.663
My ex-boyfriend loved being choked.

12:02.664 --> 12:04.263
Why would you bring that up?

12:04.264 --> 12:06.503
Seems like quite a big risk, doesn't
it, to ask someone to choke you?

12:06.504 --> 12:07.983
Like, you have to really believe

12:07.984 --> 12:09.663
that they're gonna want to choke you.

12:09.664 --> 12:12.063
And I just don't know what he saw in me

12:12.064 --> 12:14.143
that makes him think that I
think it's fun to hurt people

12:14.144 --> 12:15.623
that he didn't see four years ago.

12:15.624 --> 12:17.623
Maybe all the time you spent
hurting people for fun.

12:17.624 --> 12:20.383
I didn't want to do it.
I just did it to be polite.

12:20.384 --> 12:22.183
Weird to hurt someone as a favour.

12:22.184 --> 12:25.023
That's a very specific feeling
that I've never felt before.

12:25.024 --> 12:27.583
You sound so exhilarated.
I think you liked it.

12:27.584 --> 12:29.143
Yeah, it was
just so exhilarating.

12:29.144 --> 12:30.903
Hi, Ma!

12:30.904 --> 12:32.863
- I gotta go now, okay? I'm at Mum's.
- No! No, no.

12:32.864 --> 12:35.263
Wait, I didn't get to tell
you about the hot doctor.

12:35.264 --> 12:37.583
Hi, Ma! Ma, it's me.

12:37.584 --> 12:38.944
Ma?

12:49.224 --> 12:50.744
Ma?

12:57.944 --> 13:00.583
Nope. Nope.

13:00.584 --> 13:02.623
Nope. No. No.

13:02.624 --> 13:04.104
Nope.

13:18.384 --> 13:20.743
You see, he was very hot,
and he had to touch my boobies.

13:20.744 --> 13:23.223
- And Tom is worried that I...
- I need to talk to Tom.

13:23.224 --> 13:25.464
- Why?
- Just give me Tom.

13:28.144 --> 13:29.624
What's uuuup?

13:30.904 --> 13:33.784
Uh, Mum's dead. Yep, I'm sitting
with her now and she's dead.

13:34.784 --> 13:36.824
No. Nah.

13:38.864 --> 13:43.063
This is a joke. This...
this better not be a joke.

13:43.064 --> 13:45.623
No. No, no, it's not a joke.

13:45.624 --> 13:47.104
Oh, shit.

13:49.624 --> 13:51.103
I don't know what to do now.

13:51.104 --> 13:53.383
Uh, have you called an ambulance?

13:53.384 --> 13:55.263
No, I don't need to.
She's, like, she's cold.

13:55.264 --> 13:57.143
Oh, shit.

13:57.144 --> 13:59.824
Okay. Um, okay, you
need to call your dad.

14:01.544 --> 14:04.503
I don't want to. Yeah, I just
don't want to call my dad.

14:04.504 --> 14:06.423
That's just not what I want.

14:06.424 --> 14:07.904
I'm so sorry.

14:10.384 --> 14:11.903
I just don't know what to do now.

14:11.904 --> 14:14.144
Um, someone needs to come get her.

14:15.864 --> 14:17.663
I don't... I don't want
someone to come and get her.

14:17.664 --> 14:21.183
That's just not... that's
just not what I want today.

14:21.184 --> 14:24.423
Okay, I-I can call for you, if you want.

14:24.424 --> 14:26.743
I know that's not what you mean
when you say you don't want to,

14:26.744 --> 14:28.543
but I can organise it.

14:28.544 --> 14:30.024
Bye.

14:41.664 --> 14:43.143
- Hi, Josh.
- Dad?

14:43.144 --> 14:44.743
- Do you want rice?
- No rice.

14:44.744 --> 14:46.143
Black beans?

14:46.144 --> 14:48.744
Um, do black beans have carbs, Josh?

14:49.744 --> 14:51.223
- I don't know.
- Uh...

14:51.224 --> 14:53.903
No. No thanks, just to be safe.
I'm trying not to eat carbs.

14:55.424 --> 14:57.903
- All salads?
- Yeah, I'll have all the salads.

14:57.904 --> 15:00.183
- Jalapenos?
- Yes, to jalapenos.

15:00.184 --> 15:02.783
Guacamole? It's $2 extra.

15:02.784 --> 15:04.103
Uh, yeah.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.903
Gee, with the price of
avocados lately, Josh,

15:05.904 --> 15:08.583
two bucks for guacamole is
really a pretty good deal.

15:08.584 --> 15:10.103
And I'll have the spicy sauce.

15:10.104 --> 15:11.583
Are you sure? It's pretty spicy.

15:11.584 --> 15:14.303
No, no. I love it spicy, yeah.

15:14.304 --> 15:17.263
Dad, Dad... I have
something to tell you.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.504
H-h-hang on. Hang on, hang on.

15:20.664 --> 15:22.943
- Is tap all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:22.944 --> 15:24.903
What is it, Josh?

15:24.904 --> 15:26.703
Dad, Mum killed herself.

15:26.704 --> 15:28.784
I found her in her room. She's dead.

15:38.064 --> 15:39.623
Oh, shit. Sorry.

15:39.624 --> 15:41.143
No, no. I'll... I'll clean it up.

15:41.144 --> 15:43.864
- I'll get the mop, sir.
- No, it's okay. I'll clean it up.

15:46.744 --> 15:49.024
- Dad?
- Um...

15:50.544 --> 15:52.024
Dad?

15:54.624 --> 15:56.383
When was the last time you saw your mum?

15:56.384 --> 15:59.295
Uh, like, three days ago.

16:02.067 --> 16:04.303
Sorry.

16:04.304 --> 16:06.384
The timber has shrunk a bit.

16:10.184 --> 16:11.784
I'll get there.

16:16.344 --> 16:17.864
Thanks very much.

16:27.424 --> 16:29.663
I guess we better lock
up and get out of here.

16:29.664 --> 16:31.224
Yeah.

16:35.544 --> 16:37.743
We should probably clear out the fridge.

16:37.744 --> 16:39.423
I don't think you need
to clear out the fridge.

16:39.424 --> 16:41.423
I don't want things to go off.

16:41.424 --> 16:43.863
You want that milk? There's
still a few days left.

16:43.864 --> 16:46.943
Smoked salmon. No point wasting that.

16:46.944 --> 16:48.983
- Dad, it's just...
- What's in there?

16:48.984 --> 16:51.383
Dad, I just, I really need you
to stop clearing out the fridge.

16:51.384 --> 16:54.183
Dad, just stop clearing out
the fridge. Thank you.

17:13.023 --> 17:15.063
If you need anything
at all, you call me, okay?

17:15.064 --> 17:16.583
Anything. Even if it's small.

17:16.584 --> 17:20.022
If you need me to bring you
dinner, you call me and I get it.

17:20.023 --> 17:21.704
If you need a lift, you call me, yeah?

17:22.784 --> 17:24.423
You give me your laundry, okay?

17:24.424 --> 17:26.423
And if I hear that you did
anything for yourself,

17:26.424 --> 17:28.303
I will be very angry, Josh.

17:28.304 --> 17:30.024
- Oh, um, Josh...
- What?

17:32.144 --> 17:33.744
Forgot what I was gonna say.

17:34.824 --> 17:37.663
Okay, um, we should get food.

17:37.664 --> 17:39.343
Okay, are you hungry?

17:39.344 --> 17:40.823
- Hungry, Alan?
- No.

17:40.824 --> 17:42.303
Well, maybe some fish and chips.

17:42.304 --> 17:43.863
Okay, okay.

17:43.864 --> 17:45.623
Um, are you hungry, Josh?

17:45.624 --> 17:47.104
No.

17:51.064 --> 17:54.223
Well, I'm pretty annoyed that Tom's
more into the fish and chips

17:54.224 --> 17:55.743
than the lasagne I made.

17:55.744 --> 17:57.663
What? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not hungry.

17:57.664 --> 17:59.223
No, no, no. Not you.

17:59.224 --> 18:02.143
You can do whatever you
want today. It's not...

18:02.144 --> 18:04.224
Tom will give you a
hand job, if you like.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.183
Nah, nah.

18:13.664 --> 18:15.543
Hello.

18:15.544 --> 18:17.983
Josh, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have left.

18:17.984 --> 18:20.303
Uh, what... Oh, no, Hannah.

18:20.304 --> 18:22.343
I just didn't know.

18:22.344 --> 18:24.943
I didn't listen to her, Josh. I just...

18:24.944 --> 18:27.663
- You know, how did I assume...
- Don't, Hannah.

18:27.664 --> 18:29.583
That she was just being
mean for the fun of it?

18:29.584 --> 18:31.303
It's like I forgot she was mental.

18:31.304 --> 18:32.624
I just left.

18:33.344 --> 18:34.663
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

18:34.664 --> 18:37.432
Um, hey, you know this
isn't your fault, yeah?

18:38.904 --> 18:40.623
I don't know what to do.

18:41.304 --> 18:44.343
- Yeah. You know, uh...
- I just can't handle the guilt.

18:44.344 --> 18:47.703
I don't want to go back to the hospital.

18:47.704 --> 18:50.503
I just don't want to.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.224
I'm gonna have to, aren't I?

19:04.184 --> 19:05.463
Hello?

19:05.464 --> 19:07.383
Hannah, I just... I gotta go to bed.

19:07.384 --> 19:10.383
Oh, fuck. Sorry. I'm so sorry, Josh.

19:10.384 --> 19:11.863
Goodbye. I'm sorry.

19:15.984 --> 19:18.704
I just... I think I'm gonna
need you to call Arnold.

19:19.944 --> 19:22.072
- I can do that.
- Thank you.

19:43.264 --> 19:44.744
He's not answering.

19:46.104 --> 19:48.507
I'm a bit worried it's
going to go to voice-mail.

19:48.864 --> 19:50.903
Please leave a message
and I will call you back.

19:50.904 --> 19:52.623
Should I leave a message?

19:52.624 --> 19:53.984
No.

20:02.504 --> 20:03.983
Maybe tell me about your day.

20:04.662 --> 20:05.823
Uh, okay.

20:05.824 --> 20:07.863
While Ella was in the room

20:07.864 --> 20:10.623
being examined by the really hot doctor,

20:10.624 --> 20:12.463
uh, I read an article

20:12.464 --> 20:15.183
about how if you are a blind
person allergic to dogs

20:15.184 --> 20:17.223
you can get a miniature guide horse.

20:17.224 --> 20:19.223
- Miniature guide horse?
- Yeah.

20:19.224 --> 20:23.023
Yeah, that's what I read,
that if you are a blind person

20:23.024 --> 20:25.663
you can get a miniature
prostitute to guide you around.

20:25.664 --> 20:27.143
That sounds expensive.

20:27.144 --> 20:29.104
All right, guys, it's
"miniature sex workers" now.

20:34.384 --> 20:37.023
I want you to know, we actually
already had that conversation today,

20:37.024 --> 20:40.223
but we did again so that you
could hear the funny horse pun.

20:40.224 --> 20:41.704
Thank you.

20:43.224 --> 20:44.384
Yep.

20:44.385 --> 20:46.743
I'm so sorry that your
mum is still dead.

20:46.744 --> 20:49.143
Yeah.

20:49.144 --> 20:51.063
Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed.

20:51.064 --> 20:53.743
- Are you okay to be by yourself?
- Yep.

20:53.744 --> 20:58.143
Do you need anything?
Tea or wine? Maybe not alcoholic.

20:58.144 --> 21:00.863
- Hot chocolate?
- No. I'm fine, thank you.

21:00.864 --> 21:02.183
- Goodnight.
- Night.

21:02.184 --> 21:03.224
Night.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.584
That...

21:13.430 --> 21:16.446
that was just the most difficult
thing I've ever done.

21:18.384 --> 21:20.064
It's so awful.

21:21.344 --> 21:25.664
I feel... I feel so useless and small.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.928
There, you see?

21:50.929 --> 21:53.489
Ooh. There we go.

21:57.936 --> 21:59.576
- All right, Grace.
- Yeah.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.794
I know I'm the worst friend!

22:10.802 --> 22:15.602
I said I'd call and I didn't. I'm a
dick! I'm a penis! I'm an actual penis!

22:16.832 --> 22:19.951
Um, so this is one of the
hardest conversations

22:19.952 --> 22:21.431
you're gonna have in your life.

22:21.432 --> 22:23.111
Are you ready?

22:23.112 --> 22:24.112
No.

22:25.792 --> 22:28.272
Um...

22:29.912 --> 22:31.472
Mum killed herself.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.072
Oh.

22:44.575 --> 22:47.215
I can think of literally
nothing helpful to say.

22:48.082 --> 22:50.601
Like, there's just nothing in the world.

22:50.602 --> 22:53.281
So, yes, thank you
for acknowledging that.

22:53.282 --> 22:54.761
Everyone keeps trying to make it better,

22:54.762 --> 22:56.801
but it just can't, it
cannot be made better.

22:56.802 --> 22:58.681
No, this is
just one of those things

22:58.682 --> 23:01.089
that's gonna be really shit for a while.

23:01.642 --> 23:04.282
And then one day it's just
gonna feel less shit.

23:06.082 --> 23:07.562
Yeah.

23:08.882 --> 23:11.281
Uh, sometimes when I think of her,

23:11.282 --> 23:14.241
the last few conversations
that we've had, they just...

23:14.242 --> 23:16.801
they seem like she was
trying to say goodbye.

23:21.282 --> 23:23.121
Fuck.

23:23.122 --> 23:24.602
I have to go.
