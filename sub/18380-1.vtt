02:15.536 --> 02:17.120
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:17.162 --> 02:21.625
Thank you. Good morning.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.921
Good morning. Hi!

02:25.963 --> 02:28.881
- Hi.
- Okay, so now, your 2:00 is moved to 5:30,

02:28.882 --> 02:30.717
so I canceled cocktails
with Will Ambrose.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.261
You have a 4 a.m.
conference call

02:32.302 --> 02:33.553
with New York in the morning.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.097
I need you to review
and sign these.

02:35.138 --> 02:36.407
- These are done.
- Great. Excellent.

02:36.431 --> 02:38.559
- Here you go. Pen. All right.
- No.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.561
And I need you to decide between
this generic holiday goose

02:41.562 --> 02:45.607
with a bow around its neck,
or this winter wonderland cabin

02:45.649 --> 02:48.193
for this year's
P.C. corporate holiday card.

02:48.235 --> 02:51.822
Shouldn't there be a picture of fruit
or a chocolate manger or something?

02:51.863 --> 02:53.615
We're a food
distribution company.

02:53.657 --> 02:55.635
I don't make the cards,
I just sign your name to em.

02:55.659 --> 02:59.579
Okay, um... goose.
You can eat that, right?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.582
Yeah, if you live
in a Dickens novel.

03:01.623 --> 03:03.768
Can you put out a memo
that we're gonna close up shop

03:03.792 --> 03:05.669
early tomorrow
for Thanksgiving Eve, please?

03:05.711 --> 03:09.089
Really? Does that privilege
extend to your humble assistant?

03:09.131 --> 03:11.757
- It does.
- Are you going soft on me?

03:11.758 --> 03:14.594
No. I have plenty to do,
but Mom's forcing me

03:14.595 --> 03:17.431
to come over and
stuff a Turducken.

03:17.472 --> 03:19.933
Why in the world would
your mother let you cook?

03:19.975 --> 03:22.745
Because the professional chef in the
family is bringing home her new boyfriend.

03:22.769 --> 03:25.731
- Ooh! Have you met him yet?
- No, no one has.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.233
But, um, Katie says
there's some big surprise,

03:28.275 --> 03:30.944
so while you're at it, can you
make me a list of wedding venues,

03:30.986 --> 03:34.447
a spreadsheet, because the girl is
as transparent as tissue paper.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.825
- That's so exciting!
- Is it?

03:36.867 --> 03:38.784
You're such a grump before
you have any caffeine. Here.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.430
Speaking of which,
don't forget you have

03:40.454 --> 03:41.556
coffee with your dad at 5:00.

03:41.580 --> 03:42.788
He wants to go over

03:42.789 --> 03:44.333
the Rowling Vineyards proposal.

03:44.374 --> 03:46.084
Well, as the person
that personally piloted

03:46.126 --> 03:48.920
your exhaustive research, I can
assure you, you're prepared.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.797
I'm gonna ask him
to let me run the deal.

03:50.839 --> 03:53.091
- Go team!
- By the way,

03:53.133 --> 03:55.134
did you finalize the rentals
for the holiday office party?

03:55.135 --> 03:57.679
- Yep.
- Fantastic. I want everything to be perfect.

03:57.721 --> 03:59.806
You guys deserve it.
Basically, my whole goal

03:59.848 --> 04:02.141
is for everyone to have so much
fun that their head explodes.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.477
That's festive.

04:03.518 --> 04:05.978
Also, can you
Google Turducken?

04:05.979 --> 04:09.983
Yes. It's a chicken stuffed inside
of a duck stuffed inside of a turkey.

04:10.025 --> 04:12.569
Okay, I'm gonna need
some rubber gloves.

04:13.445 --> 04:14.655
Katie's engaged.

04:14.696 --> 04:17.156
Love is in the air.

04:17.199 --> 04:19.158
So is the swine flu, Zelda.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.994
Don't offend Cupid, Carrie Tate.

04:21.036 --> 04:24.081
He could have an arrow
with your name on it.

04:40.430 --> 04:44.101
How do you misspell "Mark"?

04:44.142 --> 04:48.522
With a hint of irony
and extra foam, apparently.

04:48.563 --> 04:52.693
- That is... I mean, cheers.
- Cheers..

04:54.528 --> 04:58.156
So, Dad, a golf game, coffee.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.866
Plan on making it into
the office anytime soon?

05:00.867 --> 05:02.828
I don't have to be
a workaholic anymore,

05:02.869 --> 05:04.663
because you've
taken over that job.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.708
Okay! So I can have
your big corner office too?

05:07.749 --> 05:10.502
- Wonderful.
- Patience, grasshopper.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.587
When have you ever
known me to have patience?

05:12.629 --> 05:16.258
I can, however, rock a spreadsheet.

05:18.135 --> 05:20.345
- The cover art's impressive.
- I try.

05:20.387 --> 05:24.266
Okay. So, Rowling Vineyards.
They're a winery in Napa.

05:24.307 --> 05:26.703
And just this last year, their
entire Pinot crop was destroyed

05:26.727 --> 05:28.937
by black rot and now they're
on the verge of bankruptcy.

05:28.979 --> 05:32.983
So I believe that we could recoup

05:33.024 --> 05:35.610
our entire initial investment
in, listen to this, six months,

05:35.652 --> 05:38.947
if we just
streamline operations.

05:38.989 --> 05:42.242
- You're talking about layoffs?
- That's a sticking point.

05:42.284 --> 05:45.787
So the company currently has
about 25 full-time employees.

05:45.829 --> 05:49.415
And the family's very concerned for their
welfare so they want everyone kept on.

05:49.416 --> 05:52.377
- So how do you get around that?
- We don't necessarily have to.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.856
They aren't utilizing their
resources to the fullest potential,

05:54.880 --> 05:57.591
and we would bring them
into national distribution.

05:59.009 --> 06:02.762
Dad? I want to run
this deal by myself.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.807
Carrie, if you hadn't asked,

06:05.849 --> 06:07.684
I would have offered
it to you anyway.

06:08.477 --> 06:12.147
- You're ready.
- I know.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.941
And humble, too.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.653
Yeah. Well, Emerson Foods
is everything to me, Dad.

06:18.695 --> 06:21.507
I know, Care-Bear. But please don't
forget to take a day off now and then.

06:21.531 --> 06:25.368
You know, just to give the cleaning
lady a chance to vacuum your office.

06:25.410 --> 06:27.621
- Thank you.
- Shows what you know, sir.

06:27.662 --> 06:30.499
I gave my entire team
off tomorrow afternoon.!

06:30.540 --> 06:33.585
You can't fool me.!

06:33.627 --> 06:38.715
'Cause I know that you were called home
for kitchen duty by Sergeant Bitsy.

06:38.757 --> 06:44.137
Yes. Yeah, I think she just wants
someone to gush to over Katie's new boy.

06:44.179 --> 06:47.474
Ah, yes. The big surprise.
Katie's in love.

06:47.516 --> 06:49.434
Your mother is all
atwitter about it.

06:49.476 --> 06:53.230
Munchkin, try to keep her
from driving your sister crazy

06:53.271 --> 06:55.065
- when she gets in.
- Promise.

06:56.274 --> 06:58.860
Good. That's my girl.

06:58.902 --> 07:01.112
Please, don't. Okay.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.156
You know what?
The next time you go golfing,

07:03.198 --> 07:06.659
you should get one of those
Scottish hats with the big pom-pom,

07:06.660 --> 07:10.996
and do this and...
it demands respect. Truly.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.834
- Yes.
- Now you know what to get me for Christmas.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.760
My goodness.
Look at how cute we are.

07:23.802 --> 07:25.762
My God. You are gorgeous.

07:25.804 --> 07:29.182
I can't wait till Carrie gets here.
You're gonna love her.

07:29.224 --> 07:32.394
- Hello!
- She's here!

07:33.728 --> 07:38.191
Hi! Ethan, I am
exceptionally pleased

07:38.233 --> 07:40.277
to introduce you
to my sister, Carrie.

07:41.403 --> 07:44.155
Her beauty is only surpassed
by her business acumen.

07:44.197 --> 07:48.368
- Stop.
- I am so glad to finally meet you.

07:48.410 --> 07:49.494
- Me too.
- No, no, no!

07:49.536 --> 07:50.620
I don't shake hands.

07:50.662 --> 07:52.455
- I'm a hugger.
- Okay!

07:52.497 --> 07:55.667
Okay!

07:55.709 --> 07:59.713
Hi! Wow! So this
is the famous Ethan.

07:59.754 --> 08:03.091
Tell me, how did you manage to drag
this one away from her restaurant?

08:03.133 --> 08:05.551
I didn't.
I am one of her vendors.

08:05.552 --> 08:08.263
Ethan has
a prospering organic farm.

08:08.305 --> 08:10.181
We serve his vegetables
at the restaurant,

08:10.223 --> 08:13.226
- and they are simply stunning.
- Thanks, babe.

08:13.268 --> 08:15.812
Well played, Ethan. If anything
can turn this one's head,

08:15.854 --> 08:19.357
- it's an heirloom tomato.
- He also forages.

08:20.525 --> 08:22.652
Truffles...

08:22.694 --> 08:26.114
- Wow.
- Mushrooms, and pine nuts.

08:26.156 --> 08:29.159
He's a trailblazer
in the wild food movement.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.746
- I teach a class on it.
- So you just find food?

08:32.787 --> 08:34.246
Like a mountain man or...?

08:34.246 --> 08:36.666
Basically, but with
a little less beard.

08:36.707 --> 08:38.960
It's an impactful
skill to possess.

08:39.001 --> 08:42.087
- I'm sure.
- We will never starve so long as I have these.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.925
- Let's eat.
- Carrie, you really have to come up to Napa.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.904
You haven't been to the
restaurant since the opening

08:47.928 --> 08:49.971
and I know that you
would love Ethan's farm.

08:50.013 --> 08:52.807
- I know. I'm sure.
- We're harvesting Brussels sprouts.

08:52.849 --> 08:54.976
It's a blast!

08:55.018 --> 08:57.937
Thanks, but, you know, I'm just... I've
been so swamped with work, Katie.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.232
And it's... it's my baby.
And my boyfriend.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.609
And my weekends and my
vacations, and...

09:03.610 --> 09:08.490
- But I love it, so and...
- That is exactly how I feel about the restaurant.

09:08.531 --> 09:10.282
Hey, what about me?

09:10.283 --> 09:13.995
Well, you, darling, are my sun,
my moon, and my sky.

09:14.037 --> 09:16.998
- There she is!
- Hi, Mom.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.626
Hi, honey. Dinner is served.

09:22.003 --> 09:23.797
Hope they don't sit us
in the kids' table.

09:23.838 --> 09:26.800
He's such a jokester.

09:29.886 --> 09:34.182
Ethan, I totally love that you're growing
some of the vegetables or whatever.

09:34.224 --> 09:38.395
But, Katie, when am I going to get you
to accept an Emerson Food contract?

09:38.436 --> 09:42.232
Well, you know, I really am
trying to be more farm-to-table.

09:42.273 --> 09:45.652
What are... It's not like we sell
vegetables grown in outer space.

09:45.694 --> 09:50.489
I just like to have a relationship
with the farmers that I buy from.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.658
- Clearly, you do.
- Okay.

09:52.659 --> 09:55.828
Is this a really appropriate
Thanksgiving dinner conversation?

09:55.829 --> 09:57.956
Fine. Fine, no business
talk at the table.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.499
That's right. You promised.

09:59.541 --> 10:03.086
So what is this surprise you
have for us, Miss Katie?

10:03.128 --> 10:06.589
You're pregnant, aren't you?

10:06.631 --> 10:10.051
- Katie! Are you?
- What?

10:10.093 --> 10:14.180
No! You are terrible!
- Come on, Katie, we can tell 'em.

10:14.222 --> 10:18.601
We will tell them at the right
moment and not a second sooner.

10:18.643 --> 10:21.187
Ooh. Practically perfect
Katie has a plan.

10:21.229 --> 10:24.315
Perpetually pesky Carrie
will annoy her older sister.

10:24.357 --> 10:28.778
And in the meantime, my
Turducken is getting cold.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.822
That's right.
Shall we call a truce, girls?

10:32.198 --> 10:34.993
Fine. Only in the name
of warm Turducken.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.037
- To warm Turducken!
- Hear! Hear!

10:38.038 --> 10:39.998
To my warm Turducken.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.501
- Mom!
- I've always loved your warm Turducken, darling.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.378
- Stop!
- Jesus!

10:45.420 --> 10:47.005
Dad!

10:57.182 --> 10:58.933
I would like to say something.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.690
I am full of
gratitude this year.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.733
My restaurant is
doing magnificently.

11:07.734 --> 11:11.070
I have a loyal and gracious staff.
They are just so talented.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.490
And I am so very inspired.

11:14.616 --> 11:16.367
I'm thankful for my family.

11:16.409 --> 11:20.038
You all have offered nothing
but love and support.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.207
And I am very, very thankful

11:22.248 --> 11:25.960
for this divine man
sitting right here.

11:26.002 --> 11:28.296
I know I told you all
that I have a surprise,

11:28.338 --> 11:32.175
so clear your calendars
for Christmas Eve

11:32.217 --> 11:34.177
because you are invited
to a holiday wedding!

11:34.219 --> 11:36.762
We're engaged!

11:36.763 --> 11:40.099
My Katie!

11:40.100 --> 11:42.268
Congratulations!

11:42.310 --> 11:43.561
Wonderful!

11:45.063 --> 11:47.439
I never would have guessed!

11:47.440 --> 11:50.360
You'll be the most beautiful bride!

11:50.401 --> 11:54.280
- Mom, thank you!
- Welcome to the family. Okay!

11:54.322 --> 11:55.948
All right!

11:56.529 --> 11:58.280
Okay, so this one right here?

11:58.322 --> 12:00.825
I think it looks darn
close to perfect, don't you?

12:00.866 --> 12:04.119
- I think so.
- Is the game over, boys?

12:04.161 --> 12:07.206
- Don't ask.
- I'm sorry, honey. But you know what?

12:07.248 --> 12:12.419
I'm really glad you're here,
'cause I could use your help.

12:12.461 --> 12:14.588
Hi.

12:14.630 --> 12:17.967
Girls, Ethan. Your mother
and I have something

12:18.008 --> 12:19.676
we'd like to discuss with you.

12:19.677 --> 12:21.929
Maybe we should have
some more eggnog first.

12:21.971 --> 12:25.224
Mom's plying us with
alcohol and hospitality, Katie.

12:25.266 --> 12:28.644
- It must be serious.
- Dad, please don't let this

12:28.686 --> 12:31.521
be some ridiculous family
initiation for Ethan.

12:31.522 --> 12:33.858
I've only just secured
his undying love.

12:33.899 --> 12:35.943
Don't make him
regret the decision.

12:35.985 --> 12:39.488
We just need to discuss
some family business.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.199
Um, it's about your grandmother.

12:42.241 --> 12:44.660
- What's wrong with Nana?
- Nana's fine.

12:44.702 --> 12:49.999
No, your grandmother Lucille, about her...
about her will, actually.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.709
Her will?

12:54.420 --> 12:56.797
Mark? Okay.

12:56.839 --> 13:00.049
God, I don't know
how to say this. Okay.

13:00.050 --> 13:03.971
My mother had some very strong
feelings about certain things,

13:04.013 --> 13:07.600
like gender roles.
She was just...

13:07.641 --> 13:09.184
- Old-fashioned?
- Yes.

13:09.226 --> 13:12.313
Stiff as a
board is more like it.

13:12.354 --> 13:15.816
One time she took us slip shopping
because a proper young lady

13:15.858 --> 13:18.944
never leaves the house...
- Without appropriate undergarments!

13:18.986 --> 13:21.923
Do you remember when she made us learn how
to fold the napkins into little swans

13:21.947 --> 13:23.925
- and we'd chuck them off the balcony?
- Swan dive!

13:23.949 --> 13:25.826
- Swan dive!
- Okay, girls. Please, please.

13:25.868 --> 13:28.077
Okay, just let me
get through this.

13:28.078 --> 13:34.043
So when Daddy died, he left the
company entirely to my mother,

13:34.084 --> 13:36.438
who didn't believe that women
should be involved in business,

13:36.462 --> 13:40.925
so when she passed, she didn't
leave the company to me.

13:40.966 --> 13:44.428
She left it to... one of you.

13:47.431 --> 13:48.641
Which one of us?

13:48.682 --> 13:50.601
She had a provision in her will

13:50.643 --> 13:53.604
that whichever one
of you marries first,

13:53.646 --> 13:58.817
the company would immediately
go to that daughter's husband.

14:00.945 --> 14:03.113
- Mom, that's not funny.
- I know.

14:03.155 --> 14:06.450
- It's really not.
- Dad, come on.

14:06.492 --> 14:08.827
- Honey, please. Please.
- What?!

14:08.869 --> 14:10.954
Why didn't you
tell us about this?

14:10.955 --> 14:12.748
Because I did not want
to spark some sort of

14:12.790 --> 14:14.792
competition between
the two of you.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.961
What does...
what does this mean?

14:17.002 --> 14:22.049
Well, it means that after
you and Ethan get married,

14:22.091 --> 14:24.802
legally...

14:24.843 --> 14:27.805
Ethan will own Emerson Foods.

14:27.846 --> 14:31.850
Okay, this is ridiculous! There has
to be something we can do about this!

14:31.892 --> 14:34.311
Believe me, I under...
We have tried.

14:34.353 --> 14:37.480
We have been to so many
attorneys over the years.

14:37.481 --> 14:39.817
This is so unfair! Dad, come on!

14:39.858 --> 14:42.236
Okay, Carrie has worked so hard.

14:42.277 --> 14:44.363
- Emerson Food is her dream.
- Thank you.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.690
I don't want the company.
This isn't right.

14:46.691 --> 14:48.484
- Carrie, I will give it to you.
- Okay.

14:48.526 --> 14:52.529
Katie, let's just think
about this for a minute.

14:52.530 --> 14:54.323
What is that supposed to mean?

14:54.365 --> 14:56.700
I just don't think
Katie should be so hasty.

14:56.701 --> 15:00.871
This is a big deal, and maybe
everybody should sleep on it

15:00.913 --> 15:03.540
before we make
any big decisions.

15:03.541 --> 15:05.251
You don't have
to make any decisions!

15:05.292 --> 15:06.603
None of this has
anything to do with you!

15:06.627 --> 15:08.963
Well, apparently, I do.

15:09.004 --> 15:13.342
- Okay, um...
- This is exactly what I didn't want to have happen.

15:13.384 --> 15:15.052
I am so sorry, honeys.

15:15.094 --> 15:18.806
We have tried on this,
but our hands are tied.

15:18.848 --> 15:21.391
Carrie, we can figure this out.

15:21.392 --> 15:23.686
That's really easy
for you to say.

15:23.728 --> 15:26.105
Honey, I know why you're angry.
You have every right...

15:26.147 --> 15:28.733
We're gonna get through
this. Okay? We're gonna be okay.

15:28.774 --> 15:32.528
Everything's gonna be fine.
Nothing's set in stone.

15:32.570 --> 15:37.240
The whole point of this conversation is
that it's set in stone! Be quiet, please!

15:37.241 --> 15:38.908
Carrie, stop yelling at Ethan!

15:38.909 --> 15:40.887
- Katie, just let her get it out.
- You know what? No!

15:40.911 --> 15:42.579
You know what? Never mind.
Why don't we all

15:42.580 --> 15:45.081
just decorate for Christmas!
Everyone!

15:45.082 --> 15:47.917
Be careful, don't put
Mrs. Santa above Santa.

15:47.918 --> 15:51.505
We wouldn't want her to get
any ideas about taking over.

15:51.547 --> 15:52.757
Really, Dad?

15:52.798 --> 15:54.049
Honey...

15:55.843 --> 15:57.178
Dad!

16:22.453 --> 16:24.120
Mr. Courtney.

16:24.121 --> 16:26.582
- Mark Tate.
- Dylan Courtney. Pleasure.

16:26.624 --> 16:30.503
- Hi, Carrie Tate.
- Hi, Carrie. Pleasure.

16:30.544 --> 16:32.922
This is... you already
met... my assistant.

16:32.963 --> 16:35.257
We didn't shake. Soft.

16:35.299 --> 16:37.802
- Can we offer you some coffee?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

16:37.843 --> 16:39.512
- Okay.
- All right, that's...

16:39.553 --> 16:42.807
- Okay, all right. Bye!
- Bye.

16:45.309 --> 16:50.189
I'm... I'm sorry. I thought that I was
speaking with Tom or Marilyn today.

16:50.231 --> 16:52.650
No, the Rowlings retained
me as independent counsel.

16:52.691 --> 16:56.612
- I see.
- Shall we begin?

16:56.654 --> 16:58.655
Of course.

16:58.656 --> 17:00.950
First off, just let it be
known that the only reason

17:00.991 --> 17:04.262
why the Rowlings are doing this is because
they want to secure their employees' jobs.

17:04.286 --> 17:06.829
I mean, they never wanted to
be swallowed by a bigger fish.

17:06.830 --> 17:09.290
Well, Emerson Foods
is a family company.

17:09.333 --> 17:13.546
It is. A very big family company
with a very different vision.

17:13.587 --> 17:15.339
What exactly do
you mean by that?

17:15.381 --> 17:17.108
Well, it means the Rowlings
are a little gun-shy

17:17.132 --> 17:18.759
about being co-opted
by a company

17:18.800 --> 17:20.612
who could turn their
100-year-old family vineyard

17:20.636 --> 17:23.055
into something that
slings wine coolers.

17:23.097 --> 17:25.516
I understand, and
I agree, actually.

17:25.558 --> 17:28.269
But they'd rather die on their
artisanal swords than go corporate?

17:28.310 --> 17:30.353
They'd like to preserve
the character of the company.

17:30.354 --> 17:32.940
Right. I'm just not sure
they're in any position

17:32.982 --> 17:35.192
to be picky, Mr. Courtney.

17:37.027 --> 17:40.406
Listen, we're both aware that
this is the perfect opportunity

17:40.447 --> 17:44.033
for Emerson Foods to move into
the alcoholic beverages market.

17:44.034 --> 17:46.388
Yes. Be that as it may, I don't
think there are many companies

17:46.412 --> 17:48.998
out there willing to
take on a failing vineyard.

17:49.039 --> 17:52.084
That may be true, but what they
really need is some guidance.

17:52.126 --> 17:54.545
What they really
need is some help.

17:54.587 --> 17:57.214
I'm... I'm sorry,
maybe we misunderstood.

17:57.256 --> 18:00.383
We're not here to offer
consultation services.

18:00.384 --> 18:03.429
That's understood, but I'm also not
here to offer up my clients' company

18:03.470 --> 18:05.806
to the first bidder out of fear.

18:05.848 --> 18:08.434
Mr. Courtney, I think
you misunderstand the nature...

18:08.475 --> 18:11.896
- I think I understand perfectly.
- Let's just cut to the chase.

18:11.937 --> 18:13.898
We're prepared to make
an offer today.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.047
That's a ridiculous offer.

18:38.964 --> 18:41.800
- I disagree.
- I'm sure you do.

18:41.842 --> 18:45.261
Okay. This was a waste of time.

18:45.262 --> 18:48.933
Mr. Courtney, I think
it's a very generous offer.

18:49.892 --> 18:51.101
Well, here's what I'll do.

18:51.143 --> 18:52.829
I will take your generous
offer to the Rowlings

18:52.853 --> 18:55.397
and I'll see what
they have to say.

18:55.439 --> 18:58.859
- Until then, nice meeting you.
- Mr. Courtney.

18:58.901 --> 19:01.070
- Ms. Tate.
- No, please. Don't let us keep you.

19:01.111 --> 19:05.282
You clearly have urgent plans
to get somewhere, so...

19:06.617 --> 19:09.244
I'll be in touch later this
week with a counter offer.

19:10.245 --> 19:11.455
Thank you.

19:18.379 --> 19:21.674
Okay, okay, okay.

19:21.715 --> 19:23.944
Hi, Carrie.
It's Michelle Sullivan.

19:23.968 --> 19:28.304
Listen, I've gone over
the will and, unfortunately,

19:28.305 --> 19:31.475
your only recourse is going to be
convincing your future brother-in-law

19:31.517 --> 19:34.144
to sign the company over
to you after the wedding.

19:34.186 --> 19:39.650
When and if Katie marries first, Emerson
Foods will pass to her husband.

19:39.692 --> 19:41.944
I'm sorry I can't
give you better news.

19:44.738 --> 19:46.824
Was that The
Hunger Games over here?

19:46.865 --> 19:48.534
Mr. Courtney.

19:48.575 --> 19:50.828
No, I really... I don't have
time to think about that.

19:50.869 --> 19:53.163
My entire life is crumbling
before my very eyes.

19:53.205 --> 19:56.333
- That was the lawyer on the phone?
- Yes.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.168
When and if Katie gets married,
Ethan gets the company.

19:59.169 --> 20:03.841
- Well, what's the "if"?
- There is... nothing.

20:03.882 --> 20:06.135
Technically, I could
still get married first.

20:12.057 --> 20:17.104
What did... Technically, I could
still get married first.

20:19.314 --> 20:21.191
Zelda, I have a plan!

20:21.233 --> 20:24.778
I... I just... what... I just
have to get married first!

20:24.820 --> 20:27.489
- Here we go. No.
- Stop, listen! No, stop!

20:27.531 --> 20:30.784
Thank about this. I can just approach
it like hiring a new associate.

20:30.826 --> 20:33.096
I can make a suitable list of
candidates and conduct some interviews,

20:33.120 --> 20:37.374
and... and then I hire someone, if it
doesn't work out, I terminate employment.

20:37.416 --> 20:40.794
Are you saying you're gonna
hire someone to marry you?

20:40.836 --> 20:43.756
- No! What is wrong...
- Okay.

20:43.797 --> 20:48.218
Why can't I find someone just to actually
marry me, and sign the company over,

20:48.260 --> 20:50.887
and after the appropriate amount
of time, we get a divorce.

20:50.888 --> 20:54.141
What's the appropriate amount of time
for a corporate takeover marriage?

20:54.183 --> 20:57.936
Can you just make me a list
of the... the websites,

20:57.978 --> 20:59.898
the dating things that kids
are using these days?

20:59.938 --> 21:02.149
Why don't you just
talk to Katie and Ethan?

21:02.191 --> 21:04.901
- No, it's just too much drama.
- This isn't dramatic?

21:04.902 --> 21:08.947
Listen, I'm not mad at Katie, okay, and I
don't want things to get ugly with Ethan.

21:08.989 --> 21:11.074
This just makes the
decision for everyone.

21:11.075 --> 21:13.744
I get married first,
I get Emerson Foods.

21:13.786 --> 21:15.537
Okay.

21:15.579 --> 21:18.915
Go, Zelda, go! It's amazing!
Go! It's a plan!

21:18.916 --> 21:20.417
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

22:24.898 --> 22:27.359
This isn't working. How can
the pool of eligible men be so...

22:27.401 --> 22:29.820
- Completely and totally lame?
- Yes.

22:29.862 --> 22:33.574
- It's hard to get back in the game.
- This isn't a game.

22:33.615 --> 22:37.119
Right. I forgot this was a well
thought out and perfectly logical plan.

22:37.161 --> 22:39.663
Please don't make fun of me.
I just need ideas.

22:39.705 --> 22:42.040
Okay.

22:46.336 --> 22:47.880
Personal ad?

22:47.921 --> 22:50.132
No. I'm picturing
skeevy stalker types.

22:50.174 --> 22:51.800
Speed dating? I did it.

22:51.842 --> 22:54.052
What? Is there something
faster than what I'm doing now?

22:54.094 --> 22:56.638
Social media.
Catching up with old pals,

22:56.680 --> 23:00.349
cute guys from the past, the one that
got away. You have one of those?

23:00.350 --> 23:03.270
- No.
- Come on. Everyone's got the one.

23:03.312 --> 23:08.650
Well, there was, um...
there was Paul.

23:08.692 --> 23:10.527
Ooh! Who's Paul?

23:10.569 --> 23:12.779
We were, pretty
close in high school.

23:12.821 --> 23:15.699
And actually, I always thought that
we would eventually end up together.

23:15.741 --> 23:19.077
- Okay. This sounds good. Paul.
- But I haven't talked to him in years.

23:19.119 --> 23:21.788
- Where's Paul now?
- I think he lives here.

23:21.830 --> 23:25.541
- My mom keeps up with his mom.
- Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner!

23:25.542 --> 23:27.628
- Call her. Call her on the phone.
- Who? What?

23:27.669 --> 23:29.922
Call your mom! Call and see
if she still talks to his mom

23:29.963 --> 23:32.424
and, like, "Can I
get his number?"

23:32.466 --> 23:34.134
- Really?
- Yeah!

23:34.176 --> 23:35.718
- Like, randomly?
- Yeah.

23:35.719 --> 23:38.263
- What do I say?
- Say something about the party.

23:38.305 --> 23:40.599
- Okay, hold on. Okay.
- Be casual, be like...

23:40.641 --> 23:44.019
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom. Um, random question.

23:44.061 --> 23:46.021
Have you talked
to Connie Taylor lately?

23:46.063 --> 23:48.857
Taylor, ooh! Yeah,
I like it. Yeah!

23:48.899 --> 23:52.736
You do?

23:52.778 --> 23:54.613
Really?

23:54.655 --> 23:58.074
- Yeah?
- Let's have it.

23:58.075 --> 23:59.952
Can you give me her number?

24:12.881 --> 24:16.843
How has it possibly been this
long since we've gotten together?

24:16.885 --> 24:20.305
Well, your mother stopped paying me to
hang out with you after high school.

24:20.347 --> 24:22.808
Really? What's
in it for you now?

24:24.017 --> 24:27.312
Well, free lattes.
Thank you, by the way.

24:27.354 --> 24:31.316
It's lattes
or loneliness for me.

24:31.358 --> 24:34.278
Well...
I guess you're worth it.

24:35.362 --> 24:38.407
Okay. So we have both
been ridiculously busy.

24:38.448 --> 24:40.951
- Not an excuse.
- And we never talk anymore.

24:40.993 --> 24:45.205
- Sadly true.
- And now in the season of giving and peppermint lattes...

24:45.247 --> 24:48.958
Ew! No, no, no. Egg nog lattes.
Peppermint is disgusting.

24:48.959 --> 24:54.548
In the season of egg nog lattes, you lure me
to a semi-private location for what purposes,

24:54.589 --> 24:59.969
- I can only imagine.
- I just missed you.

24:59.970 --> 25:02.139
I miss you too.

25:02.180 --> 25:05.892
But I am not completely
without wiles.

25:05.934 --> 25:07.311
Um, Katie's getting married.

25:07.352 --> 25:10.479
Katie is getting married?
That is great.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.317
Yes, I know. It's wonderful.

25:13.358 --> 25:16.652
- I sense a little intensity.
- More on that later.

25:16.653 --> 25:19.072
Good, 'cause I love it
when the plot thickens.

25:19.114 --> 25:20.823
Okay. First things first.

25:20.824 --> 25:23.744
My mom and I are throwing
Katie an engagement party

25:23.785 --> 25:29.665
and I was wondering if you
would go with me, as my date.

25:29.666 --> 25:32.127
- A real date?
- Yep!

25:33.211 --> 25:36.340
Please say yes. I am
utterly without alternatives.

25:37.174 --> 25:38.842
- How flattering.
- No...

25:40.427 --> 25:42.387
Will you go with me or not?

25:49.269 --> 25:52.397
I would be honored

25:52.439 --> 25:56.360
to escort you to the celebration
of your sister's betrothal.

25:58.236 --> 26:00.697
- Too much?
- No, it was... it was amazing.

26:00.739 --> 26:03.283
- For the cheap seats in the back.
- You're welcome.

26:03.325 --> 26:06.536
- You're right, you're welcome.
- I said yes. I said yes.

26:22.219 --> 26:24.805
There's two on the thing.

26:25.806 --> 26:29.643
- Hi! This is nice!
- Hey, Carrie. Carrie.

26:29.684 --> 26:31.394
- Hey.
- Hi!

26:31.395 --> 26:33.562
Thank you for doing this for us.

26:33.563 --> 26:35.857
Stop! You know
Mom's the party planner.

26:35.899 --> 26:37.901
I know, but still.

26:37.943 --> 26:42.406
Carrie, you aren't still angry
with Ethan and me, are you?

26:42.447 --> 26:46.118
Katie, you didn't
do anything wrong.

26:46.159 --> 26:47.910
Good! Because I was so worried.

26:47.911 --> 26:50.372
I mean, it just puts such
a cloud over everything.

26:50.414 --> 26:52.582
Stop it. I really want
you to enjoy, okay?

26:52.624 --> 26:55.251
None of this is your fault,
and I'm... I'm sorry

26:55.252 --> 26:56.795
if I've been a
little crazy, I just...

26:56.837 --> 26:58.439
I think I don't really
know Ethan that well.

26:58.463 --> 26:59.588
Well, you better
get to know him.

26:59.589 --> 27:01.424
He is going to be your brother.

27:01.425 --> 27:03.802
True. Speaking of...

27:03.844 --> 27:07.222
Carrie, I would like to
introduce you to my best friend

27:07.264 --> 27:09.850
and my best man.

27:09.891 --> 27:13.854
Dylan. Dylan, this is
the official maid of honor

27:13.895 --> 27:18.024
and the much-adored sister
of the bride, Carrie.

27:18.066 --> 27:20.609
Carrie. Hi. Yeah.

27:20.610 --> 27:23.405
- We've... we've met.
- You're kidding?

27:23.447 --> 27:26.450
- No.
- Well, this is wonderful!

27:26.491 --> 27:27.868
How do you guys know each other?

27:27.909 --> 27:30.953
We're... we're working
on a deal together.

27:30.954 --> 27:33.623
- Not quite together.
- Okay.

27:33.665 --> 27:36.042
We are working on
a deal near one another.

27:36.084 --> 27:37.626
You should watch out for his guy

27:37.627 --> 27:39.107
because he's a tiger
in the boardroom.

27:40.755 --> 27:42.549
- He's also a great guy.
- Really?

27:42.591 --> 27:45.177
- Yeah. Saved my life.
- Ethan!

27:45.218 --> 27:46.863
- Yeah.
- You never told me this story.

27:46.887 --> 27:48.221
We were taking a road trip,

27:48.263 --> 27:49.890
we stopped at a gas station,

27:49.931 --> 27:52.641
and I saved him from eating
a pimento cheese sandwich.

27:52.642 --> 27:55.145
This guy smacked it
right out of my hands.

27:55.187 --> 27:56.497
- Right out of his hands!
- Saved my life.

27:56.521 --> 27:57.957
- I am, I'm a lifesaver.
- A great guy.

27:57.981 --> 27:59.441
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

27:59.483 --> 28:01.693
I wouldn't know any of
this awesome bro code stuff

28:01.735 --> 28:05.989
because he was too busy rejecting my
offer and walking out of the room.

28:06.031 --> 28:07.949
- It was a bad offer.
- It was?

28:07.991 --> 28:09.868
- Yeah.
- Hey.

28:09.910 --> 28:13.413
Okay. Hi!

28:15.040 --> 28:16.541
Hi. I'm Paul. I'm Carrie's date.

28:16.583 --> 28:19.669
- Remember Paul?
- Hey, Paul.

28:22.672 --> 28:24.633
Clearly I missed something.

28:24.674 --> 28:27.069
Katie, do you wanna catch me up
to speed so I can choose a side?

28:27.093 --> 28:30.639
I honestly have no idea.

28:30.680 --> 28:34.518
Well, nothing a good, stiff drink
won't fix. I'm taking orders.

28:34.559 --> 28:36.603
It's an open bar,
folks, don't be shy.

28:36.645 --> 28:39.981
Carrie?

28:40.023 --> 28:42.858
Vodka soda. Lime. Lime.

28:42.859 --> 28:46.279
- Katie?
- I will take more of the Pinot Noir, please.

28:46.321 --> 28:49.282
Vodka soda with lime, Pinot.

28:49.324 --> 28:52.410
I'm gonna go organic
triple IPA. Yeah.

28:52.452 --> 28:54.870
No, I'm good.
I'm fine. Thanks.

28:54.871 --> 28:58.500
Great. Well, you will get
nothing and you'll like it.

29:00.710 --> 29:02.087
Cute.

29:03.088 --> 29:04.589
Katie, honey, come here.

29:04.631 --> 29:07.425
I want Aunt Joanne
to meet Ethan.

29:07.467 --> 29:09.885
No, don't go! What...

29:13.223 --> 29:16.309
Small world?

29:16.351 --> 29:18.037
It just keeps getting smaller.

29:18.061 --> 29:20.981
Yeah.

29:21.022 --> 29:23.775
- Nice house.
- Yeah.

29:25.569 --> 29:27.988
Excuse me. I'm gonna...

29:29.406 --> 29:31.783
Only move he's got,
walking out of the room.

29:36.621 --> 29:40.041
It is going to cost a fortune
to ship all of this to Napa.

29:40.083 --> 29:42.669
Honey, don't worry.
I am going to take care of it.

29:42.711 --> 29:44.713
You just need to handle
the "thank you" notes.

29:44.754 --> 29:48.383
Carrie, sweetie, go write down a
serving dish from the Bledsoe family.

29:48.425 --> 29:50.260
- Another one?
- Yes.

29:50.302 --> 29:52.137
So many things!

29:52.178 --> 29:54.930
We should have just asked
for donations to a charity.

29:54.931 --> 29:57.684
- You have to set up house.
- Mom, seriously.

29:57.726 --> 29:59.561
I do not want this
to get out of hand.

29:59.603 --> 30:02.938
I just want a simple,
elegant, intimate wedding.

30:02.939 --> 30:04.940
I don't need
all this hullaballoo.

30:04.941 --> 30:07.569
Yes. You just hate
getting all this attention

30:07.611 --> 30:09.279
and all these presents.!

30:09.321 --> 30:11.239
We are two adults
and I own a restaurant.

30:11.281 --> 30:14.159
Honestly, Carrie, what am I gonna
do with another serving dish?

30:14.200 --> 30:18.787
You are going to write lovely thank
you notes, and that is that.

30:18.788 --> 30:21.541
Ooh. Now you sound like
Grandmother Lucille.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.501
I thought we weren't
going to talk about that.

30:23.543 --> 30:25.003
Okay, fine. No. Never mind.

30:25.045 --> 30:28.964
That Dylan fellow today,
he was very handsome.

30:28.965 --> 30:32.968
Yeah. What was going
on between you two?

30:32.969 --> 30:34.929
Um, nothing.

30:34.971 --> 30:38.016
Nothing! We're kind of
working on a deal together.

30:38.058 --> 30:40.518
Let's just say it's intense.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.520
This isn't going to
cause any problems, is it?

30:42.562 --> 30:44.813
No, darling sister.
You'll still get your

30:44.814 --> 30:48.234
- perfect wedding, don't worry.
- Okay, let's not start.

30:48.276 --> 30:51.363
I will not start if Carrie
admits that Dylan is cute.

30:51.404 --> 30:53.156
I hate you.

30:54.783 --> 30:56.326
- Okay, yes.
- Yes, what?

30:56.368 --> 30:58.203
- Yes, he's cute.
- Ha! I knew it!

30:58.244 --> 31:00.598
Yes, but unfortunately, when he
talks I want to punch him, so...

31:00.622 --> 31:03.667
- Carrie!
- Well, then there won't be any hanky-panky

31:03.708 --> 31:06.711
- amongst the wedding party.
- Mom!

31:06.753 --> 31:08.671
Please, don't engage her.
It'll only get more graphic.

31:08.672 --> 31:11.549
Okay, okay.

31:11.591 --> 31:14.844
What in the world is this?

31:14.886 --> 31:18.514
Aunt Joanne
is taking pottery classes.

31:18.515 --> 31:21.017
You don't need to send
a thank you note for that.

32:11.609 --> 32:14.236
I like all that glitter.

32:14.237 --> 32:17.740
- Carrie?
- Hey.

32:17.741 --> 32:21.661
Hi.

32:21.703 --> 32:25.331
Um... Hello, Mr. Courtney.

32:25.373 --> 32:29.753
Dylan, please. I think considering the
current attire, we can skip the formalities.

32:29.794 --> 32:31.713
- Um...
- That's a great outfit.

32:31.755 --> 32:35.884
Right, yeah, well, we've shut down for
the office Christmas party. So...

32:35.925 --> 32:39.053
I see. It's...
it's very festive.

32:39.095 --> 32:41.681
- You... you are very festive.
- Yeah.

32:41.723 --> 32:44.326
You're kind of coming on the back end.
We're about to wrap things up.

32:44.350 --> 32:48.438
- They seem to be having a ball.
- Yeah. We are a family company.

32:48.480 --> 32:51.483
You're fond of saying that.

32:54.611 --> 32:56.905
So why are you here?
Did you not get my paperwork?

32:56.946 --> 32:58.615
I had Zelda send it
over this morning.

32:58.656 --> 33:00.115
Do the Rowlings
have some questions or...?

33:00.116 --> 33:02.327
No, it's not a business visit.

33:02.368 --> 33:05.121
I'm actually here on
personal business.

33:05.163 --> 33:09.250
Sorry, Ethan and I were... we
were discussing the bachelor party.

33:09.292 --> 33:13.505
Crap. Does... I'm supposed to
throw Katie a bachelorette party!

33:13.546 --> 33:16.049
I'm, like, the worst
maid of honor ever.

33:16.090 --> 33:21.054
Well, maybe, but I can help
you with that, I think.

33:21.095 --> 33:23.056
What do you mean?

33:23.097 --> 33:25.326
Well, we've got a cabin about
an hour north of Ethan's farm,

33:25.350 --> 33:28.520
where I grew up, and Ethan and I
used to go there when we were kids.

33:28.561 --> 33:30.647
He really likes the place.
So we were talking,

33:30.688 --> 33:33.209
and he said he'd love to have the
bachelor and bachelorette party there.

33:33.233 --> 33:39.030
- So it would save you planning.
- Well, that's... um, nice. Thank you.

33:39.072 --> 33:40.657
Sure.

33:40.698 --> 33:43.785
And, of course,
Paul is more than welcome.

33:43.827 --> 33:47.496
- Also very nice. Thank you.
- Sure.

33:47.497 --> 33:49.082
Miss Carrie! Miss Carrie!

33:49.123 --> 33:51.793
- Can we have some candy, please?
- Yeah.

33:51.835 --> 33:54.921
The most beautiful dresses ever!
One for you, one for you.

33:54.963 --> 33:58.341
Merry Christmas.

33:58.383 --> 34:01.845
So, you know, I'm... elves don't have
pockets, I don't have my phone.

34:01.886 --> 34:04.639
No. I've got your email,
and we can take care of it.

34:04.681 --> 34:06.348
Yeah, and we'll
talk about dates.

34:06.349 --> 34:08.016
- Just get in touch.
- Great.

34:08.059 --> 34:10.853
- I love your... your antlers.
- Okay, bye.

34:10.895 --> 34:12.938
Okay,
I'll... I'm sorry.

34:12.981 --> 34:16.059
You know what? It's...

34:16.101 --> 34:17.561
Here you go.

34:17.601 --> 34:19.080
Make sure you don't
eat it all at once.

34:19.103 --> 34:20.813
You'll get a stomachache.

34:20.855 --> 34:22.815
Okay, bye.

34:23.608 --> 34:25.402
- I am mortified.
- What?

34:25.443 --> 34:26.945
What was Mr. Courtney
doing here?

34:26.987 --> 34:28.404
Being handsome?

34:28.405 --> 34:31.491
Mom! He wants to talk
about wedding stuff.

34:31.533 --> 34:34.077
He was oddly nice.

34:34.119 --> 34:36.411
I don't know what to do
with that information.

34:36.413 --> 34:38.415
Well, people can
be surprising sometimes.

34:38.456 --> 34:42.085
- ... Yes, they can.
- Say cheese.

35:21.958 --> 35:28.381
So, this weekend is the big
bachelorette cabin extravaganza?

35:28.423 --> 35:32.218
Yes. It's very exciting. You know
how much I love the outdoors.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.720
Well, but Paul's going, right?

35:33.762 --> 35:35.680
Yeah. He's driving
up to meet me.

35:35.722 --> 35:38.807
This one sounds promising.

35:38.808 --> 35:40.977
I really... I think
he might be perfect.

35:41.019 --> 35:44.146
I trust him and I feel like I can
make him understand all this.

35:44.147 --> 35:46.483
There's a whole lot of
all this to understand.

35:46.524 --> 35:51.446
Yeah. I, invited him
to the house tonight.

35:51.488 --> 35:56.284
Well, that sounds cozy.

35:56.326 --> 36:00.997
And between this
weekend, and, you know, tonight,

36:01.039 --> 36:02.957
if things go the way
that I think they will,

36:02.999 --> 36:06.127
I'll be able to, you know,
give him my proposal,

36:06.169 --> 36:08.170
and my "proposal".

36:08.171 --> 36:12.801
You are aware of how incredibly, insanely
Scooby Doo this all sounds, right?

36:12.842 --> 36:15.637
Sorry, did the Scooby crew
ever fail to solve a case?

36:15.679 --> 36:18.473
That comment was not
meant to encourage you.

36:18.515 --> 36:20.016
I'm trying to be positive here.

36:21.351 --> 36:23.978
Have you even talked to your
sister about what you're doing?

36:24.020 --> 36:26.855
No. I don't want to
stress her out any more.

36:26.856 --> 36:28.524
The wedding is
totally overwhelming.

36:28.525 --> 36:30.359
I think, "Surprise! I'm married!"

36:30.360 --> 36:31.986
Might stress her
out a little more.

36:32.028 --> 36:34.239
You know, it's...
Katie just wants to have

36:34.280 --> 36:36.574
her one, perfect day, and I
really want her to have it.

36:36.616 --> 36:38.535
But the company means
everything to me,

36:38.576 --> 36:41.037
so I'm gonna do whatever
I have to do to keep it.

36:41.079 --> 36:43.748
I just think Katie might
be really hurt when she...

36:43.790 --> 36:45.935
Don't you have some sort of
assistant-y thing to be doing,

36:45.959 --> 36:49.545
like getting me coffee
or alphabetizing something?

36:49.546 --> 36:52.799
Okay. Line drawn in the sand.

36:54.968 --> 36:56.761
I'm hereby out
of your personal life.

36:56.803 --> 36:59.597
No, no, no. I...
I didn't mean it like that.

36:59.639 --> 37:01.474
You're right.

37:01.516 --> 37:06.062
So, anyway, I made your flight
reservations for this weekend.

37:06.104 --> 37:08.773
There should be a confirmation
email in your inbox.

37:08.815 --> 37:12.068
- Zelda.
- Yes, Ms. Tate?

37:12.110 --> 37:13.778
Come on. Really?

37:13.820 --> 37:16.614
Just observing the protocol.

37:16.656 --> 37:19.534
Okay. Have a good weekend.

37:19.576 --> 37:21.745
Okay, love you too.

37:40.138 --> 37:42.682
Are you sad I didn't
wanna go out tonight?

37:42.724 --> 37:44.851
No, this is great.

37:48.813 --> 37:50.690
Are you... are you cold?

37:51.566 --> 37:53.276
Are you?

37:53.318 --> 37:55.153
Here.

38:00.450 --> 38:04.037
I love this movie. It isn't
Christmas until I watch it.

38:05.622 --> 38:08.833
Yeah, it's...
it's so romantic, isn't it?

38:13.421 --> 38:15.882
I'm so happy you're
coming with me this weekend.

38:15.924 --> 38:19.968
I can't miss an opportunity
to see you in hiking boots.

38:26.810 --> 38:29.646
You know, Christmas movies
make me want to snuggle.

38:29.687 --> 38:32.774
- ...okay.
- That's good.

38:39.948 --> 38:42.491
Hey, are your eyes
blue or green?

38:42.492 --> 38:44.660
My eyes are brown.

38:44.661 --> 38:49.499
Clearly, they don't pay you to be observant
over at that national conglomerate.

38:49.541 --> 38:52.252
Really? Let me see.

38:52.293 --> 38:55.755
- Are you mesmerized?
- Totally.

38:57.966 --> 39:00.426
Check this out.
I read online the other day

39:00.468 --> 39:04.639
that they trucked in 5000 pounds
of actual snow for this scene.

39:04.681 --> 39:09.185
Neat.

39:19.153 --> 39:20.363
Every time.

39:32.375 --> 39:34.543
I come bearing a sister!

39:34.544 --> 39:39.883
Hello, sister!

39:39.924 --> 39:43.553
My goodness! Have you two
been in the schnapps already?

39:43.595 --> 39:47.056
Gingerbread liqueur!
Hi! I'm Abby.

39:47.098 --> 39:50.726
Yeah, we met at Katie's
restaurant opening, right?

39:50.727 --> 39:52.937
- You're the pastry chef.
- Yes. Guilty!

39:52.979 --> 39:55.273
- I'm Ashley.
- Ashley is an artist.

39:55.315 --> 39:57.817
I have several of her mixed
media pieces in the restaurant.

39:57.859 --> 40:00.068
I'm surrounded
by creative types.

40:00.069 --> 40:03.114
- None of
Ethan's guys are here yet.

40:03.156 --> 40:06.492
- Are we expecting any hotties?
- Um, I hate that word,

40:06.534 --> 40:09.996
but yes, Ethan has invited
some very handsome friends.

40:10.038 --> 40:13.916
- Yes!
- With personalities like sandpaper.

40:13.917 --> 40:16.252
Well, I think
it's brilliant how you're having

40:16.294 --> 40:20.048
the bachelor and bachelorette
parties together.

40:20.089 --> 40:23.301
Well, Ethan and I aren't into
all that last hurrah nonsense.

40:23.343 --> 40:25.178
She wouldn't even
let me hire a stripper.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.933
There are moments when your being
uptight makes me love you a lot.

40:30.934 --> 40:34.437
Carrie, I'm going to have to ask you...

40:34.479 --> 40:37.857
to try really hard to get
along with Dylan this weekend.

40:37.899 --> 40:40.860
That's the best man, right?

40:40.902 --> 40:44.613
Is it, really? Yeah, I find
that laced with so much irony.

40:44.614 --> 40:46.824
- Carrie!
- Yes!

40:46.866 --> 40:49.452
He is the bestest best man ever.

40:49.494 --> 40:52.413
- He's amazing!
- I'm bored. Let's do a shot.

40:52.455 --> 40:53.498
- Okay!
- Go.

40:54.499 --> 40:55.792
What in the...

40:55.833 --> 40:57.960
How are you even
friends with these people?

40:57.961 --> 41:00.380
You... you'll love them.

41:00.615 --> 41:03.534
Abby, I have some thoughts
about the cake design.

41:03.576 --> 41:06.536
- What about a Buche de Noel?
- Ooh!

41:06.537 --> 41:10.208
Wait. Isn't that, like,
a giant cake roll log thing?

41:10.249 --> 41:13.961
Yes! And I could put little
woodland creatures on top.

41:14.003 --> 41:18.591
That sounds earthy like Ethan.
Maybe for the groom's cake?

41:18.633 --> 41:21.052
As long as it has chocolate,
I'm set, babe.

41:21.094 --> 41:24.680
It's chocolate.
Chocolate-flavored love.

41:26.391 --> 41:29.685
What if we have a menagerie
of woodland creatures

41:29.727 --> 41:33.523
representing our families?
A buck and doe for my parents?

41:33.564 --> 41:36.859
That does sound very dear.

41:36.901 --> 41:40.738
My God, you're marrying Dad.

41:40.780 --> 41:43.741
A buck and a doe. Yeah,
I think I could manage that.

41:43.783 --> 41:47.203
Well, I definitely want it
festooned with Christmas foliage

41:47.245 --> 41:51.332
like poinsettias,
or holly, or mistletoe.

41:51.374 --> 41:53.960
- Heads up!
- Mistletoe!

41:54.001 --> 41:56.087
Ooh!

41:56.129 --> 41:59.465
Come on, get in the
holiday spirit, dude.

41:59.507 --> 42:02.759
- I'm gonna get some coffee.
- Aw!

42:02.760 --> 42:05.262
You!

42:05.263 --> 42:08.098
Well, I am definitely not
gonna let this go to waste.

42:08.099 --> 42:12.228
Bow-chicka-bow-bow!

42:27.118 --> 42:30.288
Okay.

42:33.416 --> 42:35.501
I'm sorry. I didn't...

42:35.543 --> 42:37.462
I didn't know anybody
was out here.

42:37.503 --> 42:40.840
No, it's okay. I just
can't get a signal anywhere.

42:40.882 --> 42:44.635
Well, you probably won't. That's one
of the reasons why I love this place.

42:46.220 --> 42:47.680
Right. Yeah. I was, um...

42:47.722 --> 42:49.974
I'm just trying
to check on Paul.

42:50.016 --> 42:52.143
I'm sorry. Do your thing.

42:52.185 --> 42:54.811
Um... listen.

42:54.812 --> 42:57.482
Thanks for putting
all this together.

42:57.523 --> 42:59.942
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
It's no problem.

42:59.984 --> 43:02.278
I mean, I know you're
going through a lot

43:02.320 --> 43:05.489
with your grandmother's
will and everything.

43:05.490 --> 43:07.950
Ethan kind of filled me in.

43:07.992 --> 43:09.577
He did?

43:09.619 --> 43:11.329
He must have had
a lot of questions.

43:11.370 --> 43:13.998
Naturally, he had a few.

43:14.040 --> 43:17.668
It must be nice to have a corporate
lawyer as a best bud, right?

43:19.086 --> 43:21.506
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
- I'm not upset.

43:21.547 --> 43:23.734
I'm just really frustrated
that I can't get any reception.

43:23.758 --> 43:26.176
You'd think a global communications
company would find a place

43:26.177 --> 43:28.513
to nail a satellite to a pine
tree out here or something.

43:28.554 --> 43:30.389
- It's ridiculous.
- I keep feeling like we're

43:30.431 --> 43:32.058
just getting off
on the wrong foot.

43:32.099 --> 43:33.726
Do you have a landline?

43:35.144 --> 43:37.396
No.

43:38.564 --> 43:41.358
No, I don't, but...

43:41.359 --> 43:43.069
I can drive you into town.

43:43.110 --> 43:47.156
Um... okay. Thanks.

43:47.198 --> 43:50.159
- Okay. Sorry.
- It's fine.

43:50.201 --> 43:52.328
After you, really.

43:54.372 --> 43:56.666
Just pull. Right here.

43:56.707 --> 43:58.960
You need to... There you go.

44:01.045 --> 44:03.422
I have arrived!

44:03.464 --> 44:07.426
Just in time for
lunch and debauchery.

44:07.468 --> 44:10.012
- Looks like he made it. Hey!
- Hey.

44:10.054 --> 44:14.600
- Great.
- I was worried!

44:39.208 --> 44:42.128
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:42.169 --> 44:45.088
- Is everyone back from the hike?
- Yeah, I'm just,

44:45.089 --> 44:47.257
- I'm just grabbing beers for everybody.
- Nice.

44:47.258 --> 44:50.886
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. I've made such a mess in here.

44:50.928 --> 44:53.681
- I'll clean it up.
- No, I didn't, I didn't know you cooked.

44:53.723 --> 44:58.227
I don't cook. I bake.
There's a big difference.

44:58.269 --> 45:02.940
- Where's Paul?
- Um, I sent him into town to get more sprinkles.

45:02.982 --> 45:06.027
He's a, he's
a nice guy. I like him.

45:06.068 --> 45:09.112
Yeah. He's an old friend.

45:09.113 --> 45:12.074
Can you... Do you mind
just grabbing that batch?

45:12.116 --> 45:14.535
Yeah. Sure. Gotcha.

45:16.954 --> 45:18.998
Man.

45:20.708 --> 45:24.127
- These smell incredible.
- It's an old family recipe.

45:26.005 --> 45:30.343
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about earlier.

45:30.384 --> 45:32.678
- About what?
- Well, you know, about Ethan.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.638
- I didn't really...
- No, no! We don't... please.

45:34.639 --> 45:37.183
Let's not talk about it. Here.

45:41.437 --> 45:43.272
Man.

45:43.314 --> 45:45.107
You're giving me flashbacks.

45:45.149 --> 45:47.085
- The good kind or the bad kind?
- These are amazing.

45:47.109 --> 45:50.655
We, um, we spent Christmas
up here every year

45:50.696 --> 45:53.074
- when I was a kid.
- Yeah? Why'd you stop?

45:53.115 --> 45:56.243
After my grandpa passed away, we
just didn't do it as much anymore.

45:56.285 --> 45:57.994
You know how it is.

45:57.995 --> 46:00.247
Hold on.

46:00.289 --> 46:02.166
- Water, water.
- Stupid! It's still hot.

46:02.208 --> 46:03.626
Need somebody to help.

46:05.002 --> 46:08.005
- I was not...
- There you go.

46:12.009 --> 46:13.636
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

46:15.846 --> 46:18.349
- That's better, thank you.
- Yeah.

46:18.391 --> 46:20.768
Well, they had red
and green and yellow,

46:20.810 --> 46:24.980
and I got seriously Christmas and I got some
of those little silver ball things too.

46:25.022 --> 46:28.858
- I sustained an injury.
- Yeah. Well, you're back.

46:28.859 --> 46:31.654
So you can... you can take over.

46:31.696 --> 46:34.364
I'm gonna grab these guys,
and I'm gonna grab this.

46:34.365 --> 46:37.033
- Yeah!
- See you later.

46:37.034 --> 46:38.868
What'd you do?

46:38.869 --> 46:40.996
I was so stupid. I...
Don't touch a hot pan.

46:41.038 --> 46:43.207
- Ooh! You weren't kidding.
- Yeah.

46:43.249 --> 46:45.000
- I can take care of that.
- Yeah?

46:45.042 --> 46:46.085
Yeah.

47:00.266 --> 47:04.061
- Mom, there's so many gifts!
- No, I don't care whether she likes it or not.

47:04.103 --> 47:07.648
This one is for Aunt Joanne.

47:07.690 --> 47:10.693
So tell me, do you
think that your father

47:10.735 --> 47:14.447
is going to like
the fedora I bought him?

47:14.488 --> 47:18.242
Um, that depends. Is it 1940 and is
he planning to investigate crime?

47:18.284 --> 47:21.579
- He's just so hard to buy for.
- No, it's cute.

47:21.620 --> 47:27.418
So Connie Taylor tells me that you and
Paul have been seeing each other.

47:27.460 --> 47:30.253
Wow. I had
no idea that the, um,

47:30.254 --> 47:33.174
country club set had such an
extensive intelligence network.

47:33.215 --> 47:37.470
Yeah. Well, it does. So how
long has this been going on?

47:37.511 --> 47:40.556
You remember, I asked you
for Paul's mother's number.

47:40.598 --> 47:44.934
No. For Dad? Mom.

47:44.935 --> 47:48.731
Aren't they cute? Look,
I got two of them for Ethan too.

47:48.773 --> 47:52.985
- So is it serious?
- I... hope so.

47:56.071 --> 48:00.117
Have you and Katie figured out what's
gonna happen after the wedding?

48:00.159 --> 48:03.454
Mom, what is this,
an interrogation? It's...

48:03.496 --> 48:07.750
I just don't want you to
be surprised if Katie and Ethan

48:07.792 --> 48:11.086
decide to assert
their ownership.

48:11.128 --> 48:14.798
- Um, why, did she say something to you?
- No, not at all.

48:14.799 --> 48:18.802
But you and your sister
have a habit of...

48:18.803 --> 48:23.306
not communicating and making assumptions.
Remember the prom dress fiasco?

48:23.307 --> 48:26.393
- She bought the same dress as me.
- See? You didn't communicate.

48:26.435 --> 48:29.979
It doesn't... Look, this is
a little bit different. Okay?

48:29.980 --> 48:32.816
No. The stakes are just higher.

48:32.817 --> 48:35.318
Please talk to your sister.

48:35.319 --> 48:37.154
Fine! I will!

48:38.948 --> 48:42.409
Isn't this hilarious?

48:42.451 --> 48:46.372
- I'm sorry, did you say hideous?
- Hush. Ethan's gonna love it.

48:46.413 --> 48:48.541
- Terrifying.
- Stop.

48:48.582 --> 48:50.501
- Terrifying.
- Cute! It's very cute.

48:50.543 --> 48:52.503
It's cute? It looks like Chucky!

48:54.380 --> 48:56.507
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

48:56.549 --> 48:58.676
You're
a crazy woman. I'm done.

49:02.054 --> 49:06.267
- You look breathtaking.
- Thank you. It's just perfect.

49:06.308 --> 49:08.936
I can't imagine
a more beautiful dress.

49:08.978 --> 49:12.857
A December bride!

49:12.898 --> 49:15.859
You know, we don't sell a lot
of dresses by this designer.

49:15.860 --> 49:18.194
She is very unique.

49:18.195 --> 49:21.531
I guarantee you will not see
another bride in this dress.

49:21.532 --> 49:24.660
Isn't she beautiful?

49:24.702 --> 49:26.704
All brides are beautiful!

49:26.745 --> 49:29.498
This is going to be
challenging in terms of a veil.

49:29.540 --> 49:30.809
Do you have feelings
about a veil?

49:30.833 --> 49:32.918
Maybe flowers. Maid of honor?

49:32.960 --> 49:35.378
What do you think about
a garland of flowers?

49:35.379 --> 49:40.426
Gardenias!
- What about a white silk poinsettia, just right here?

49:45.472 --> 49:46.891
I'm... I'm sorry.

49:46.932 --> 49:48.809
I really, I have no
opinion on this.

49:48.851 --> 49:50.853
Darlene, didn't we just
get in one of those

49:50.895 --> 49:52.605
beaded silk turbans?

49:52.646 --> 49:56.317
- Turban?
- That would be intriguing.

49:56.358 --> 49:59.198
Help me get it from the stockroom and
we'll see what else is back there.

50:03.699 --> 50:06.410
- Wow!
- Do you like it?

50:06.452 --> 50:09.580
Hon!

50:09.622 --> 50:13.375
- Come here. You're so cute.
- No.

50:13.417 --> 50:18.380
Hold on. Let's see...
Come here, you.

50:18.422 --> 50:20.924
Don't look. Come here.

50:20.925 --> 50:23.636
It's okay.

50:23.677 --> 50:27.598
I'll be gentle. Look!

50:27.640 --> 50:32.937
- It's pretty.
- See? I can play.

50:32.978 --> 50:37.441
You know, Ethan said that Dylan
has been asking about you.

50:37.483 --> 50:40.194
Really? What was
he asking about?

50:40.235 --> 50:44.614
I don't know.
But Dylan is very handsome

50:44.615 --> 50:49.244
- and successful and tall.
- With occasional bouts of obnoxiousness.

50:49.286 --> 50:53.999
- Carrie, he's nice.
- Yeah, he was... he was nice at the cabin.

50:54.041 --> 50:56.293
Wow. You are so
stubborn about people.

50:56.335 --> 50:59.296
You know what?
Let's look at some veils.

51:02.383 --> 51:04.468
Carrie...

51:06.178 --> 51:08.806
I want to talk
about the company.

51:10.057 --> 51:12.267
Is Mom bugging you too
about communicating?

51:12.309 --> 51:16.772
- Let's just...
- No, but since Ethan and I

51:16.814 --> 51:19.400
are going to own the company
after the wedding...

51:19.441 --> 51:21.235
Did Ethan ask you to talk to me?

51:21.276 --> 51:23.653
Well, there isn't any reason
he shouldn't show an interest.

51:23.654 --> 51:27.408
Right. Yeah, sweet Dylan said
he was asking some questions.

51:27.449 --> 51:31.620
Ethan thinks that we could start an
organic food distribution division.

51:31.662 --> 51:34.831
You're already making plans?

51:34.832 --> 51:39.502
Well, we just started to realize that if we
are going to put our names on something...

51:39.503 --> 51:42.256
Ethan's name won't be on it,
Katie. It's Emerson Foods.

51:42.297 --> 51:46.010
I understand that,
but whether you like it or not,

51:46.051 --> 51:48.678
we are going to be owners.

51:48.679 --> 51:51.598
Katie, you have never
in your entire life

51:51.640 --> 51:53.517
expressed any
interest in the company.

51:53.559 --> 51:55.644
Carrie, don't be mad. Okay?

51:55.686 --> 51:59.148
We were just talking to Dylan about the
transfer and then all these ideas...

51:59.189 --> 52:02.317
Wait. You're talking
to Dylan about the company

52:02.359 --> 52:05.696
that I've been building, the company
that I have every right to, Katie,

52:05.738 --> 52:07.614
and you expect me not
to be mad right now?

52:07.656 --> 52:10.951
Carrie, you're acting like a spoiled
child about this whole thing.

52:10.993 --> 52:14.038
My... You are so
self-righteous, Katie.

52:14.079 --> 52:16.415
Seriously.

52:16.457 --> 52:19.418
And you know what?
You're not married yet.

52:19.460 --> 52:23.046
Okay? When and if you and
Ethan make it to the altar

52:23.047 --> 52:26.967
in your Stevie Nicks
lace-explosion, when that happens,

52:27.009 --> 52:29.237
please, you two can waltz
into the lobby of Emerson Foods

52:29.261 --> 52:33.057
and declare yourself the king and
queen of organic canned bunnies.

52:33.098 --> 52:35.893
Okay? But until that happens,
I'm gonna continue on the path

52:35.934 --> 52:38.395
that I've been on
for the last seven years, Katie,

52:38.437 --> 52:43.400
while you've been off cooking
fiddle ferns for snotty food jerks.

52:43.442 --> 52:45.110
You said you liked my dress.

52:45.152 --> 52:46.820
God, it's not
about the dress, Katie!

52:46.862 --> 52:50.074
No! It is about you
being selfish

52:50.115 --> 52:52.284
and stubborn and single-minded!

52:52.326 --> 52:55.329
You know what? I wouldn't
make any plans if I were you.

52:55.370 --> 52:57.956
It's amazing how quickly
things can change.

52:57.998 --> 53:00.750
What are you talking about?

53:00.751 --> 53:03.921
Carrie, what are
you talking about?!

53:16.975 --> 53:20.187
Hello, this is Zelda. Beep!
Just kidding, here it is.

53:20.229 --> 53:22.773
Yeah, Zelda, hey, it's me.
Can you do me a favor

53:22.815 --> 53:26.652
and make me a reservation for
two at 8 p.m. tonight at Wilde?

53:26.693 --> 53:30.280
And I also need you to have the company
jet ready at 10:30 to take me to Vegas.

53:30.322 --> 53:34.076
Um, also I need you to book
a room at the Bellagio,

53:34.118 --> 53:36.971
the penthouse if they have it, and just
make sure that you pack me a suitcase

53:36.995 --> 53:39.373
of a few things, have it ready
and waiting on the plane.

53:39.414 --> 53:42.376
And pack the white suit.
And Zelda, do not call me

53:42.417 --> 53:44.128
and ask me a million
questions about why.

54:09.528 --> 54:11.613
This is so fun.

54:11.655 --> 54:12.906
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:12.948 --> 54:14.259
- It's a great restaurant.
- Yeah.

54:14.283 --> 54:16.159
My parents know the owners.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.829
And we're actually having
Katie's rehearsal dinner here.

54:18.871 --> 54:20.831
- Okay.
- But no, I...

54:20.873 --> 54:25.210
I meant this, us,
it's... it's fun.

54:25.252 --> 54:27.796
- It is.
- Yeah.

54:27.838 --> 54:29.923
I'm not good at subtle, am I?

54:30.365 --> 54:34.410
No, you aren't, but sometimes it's
very entertaining to watch you try.

54:34.411 --> 54:37.539
I'm not the most romantic
person in the world, Paul.

54:37.581 --> 54:39.624
Practical has its place.

54:39.666 --> 54:41.710
You make me sound like Katie.

54:41.751 --> 54:45.130
- That's not a bad thing, is it?
- No!

54:50.427 --> 54:55.015
Are you okay?

54:55.056 --> 54:57.976
Um... okay.

54:59.519 --> 55:01.813
Paulie...

55:01.855 --> 55:06.108
So... I have a jet

55:06.109 --> 55:08.320
waiting to take us to Vegas,

55:08.361 --> 55:10.488
and I booked a suite
at the Bellagio.

55:10.530 --> 55:14.034
- Carrie...
- And I... Will you marry me?

55:15.243 --> 55:17.537
Tonight? I know it sounds crazy.

55:17.579 --> 55:20.832
But I... we would
shock everyone!

55:20.874 --> 55:24.878
- I can't.
- Paul, I know that you're not madly in love with me

55:24.919 --> 55:26.963
- or anything, but it's okay.
- Carrie. Carrie.

55:27.005 --> 55:30.091
I'm gay.

55:31.551 --> 55:33.553
- Come on!
- Ta-da!

55:33.595 --> 55:36.640
What are you talking about?
That's not funny.

55:44.189 --> 55:47.025
- You're serious?
- I am.

55:47.067 --> 55:50.819
My gosh!

55:50.820 --> 55:55.533
Wow. This was
the worst plan ever.

55:55.575 --> 55:57.285
I'm sorry.

55:58.995 --> 56:02.499
You know what?
I don't even care.

56:02.540 --> 56:04.459
- Well, I kind of do.
- Listen.

56:04.501 --> 56:06.395
You know that I need this
to get around the will,

56:06.419 --> 56:08.671
or else Katie and Ethan are
gonna take everything from me.

56:08.672 --> 56:11.007
No, that... that
doesn't sound like Katie.

56:11.049 --> 56:13.677
Look, it's simple.
We just, we'd get married,

56:13.718 --> 56:16.721
you sign over the company to me,
and we can go our separate ways.

56:16.763 --> 56:18.223
Carrie...

56:18.264 --> 56:21.142
Please, please, Paul, please,
can you just think about it?

56:21.184 --> 56:23.853
Carrie, listen. I love you.

56:23.895 --> 56:27.482
Great. Then do this for me.
This one thing. Please?

56:28.733 --> 56:31.444
I do want to get
married someday, but...

56:31.486 --> 56:35.490
but for real and... to a guy.

56:36.991 --> 56:38.201
Right.

56:40.120 --> 56:43.707
Okay. Then she wins. Cheers.

56:43.748 --> 56:45.792
You make it sound like
it's a football game.

56:47.627 --> 56:50.379
Was that a sports reference
from the gay guy?

56:50.380 --> 56:52.924
It's kind of ironic,
don't you think?

56:55.343 --> 56:59.472
You know, I don't think
I want dessert after all.

56:59.514 --> 57:01.724
- Paul.
- Can I call you a cab?

57:01.725 --> 57:04.059
No, I'm fine.

57:04.060 --> 57:05.937
Good night, Carrie.

57:08.565 --> 57:10.442
Okay, we have one
German chocolate cake...

57:10.483 --> 57:12.902
Lovely! Thanks.
Um... You know what?

57:12.944 --> 57:15.905
Can you just take those to the bar?
I'm gonna have them both.

57:33.423 --> 57:35.049
You know what?

57:49.189 --> 57:53.067
- Hello? Hello?
- Yeah, hi. It's... it's me.

57:53.109 --> 57:56.154
- Carrie, is that you?
- Um, who do you think you are

57:56.196 --> 57:58.740
cahooting with my sister
and the financy...

57:58.782 --> 58:01.242
her fee... sinini?

58:02.786 --> 58:05.246
- Okay.
- It's me. Um...

58:05.288 --> 58:09.458
- Try that one more time.
- Her feenan... her fyance.

58:09.459 --> 58:12.378
The boy, that boy.?

58:12.420 --> 58:14.798
Carrie, are you okay?

58:14.839 --> 58:17.675
I thought you were being nice,
and you were just being a spy.

58:17.717 --> 58:20.970
- Do you know that? You're a spy.
- Wait. It's...

58:21.012 --> 58:23.515
- So rude.
- Okay, Carrie, just calm down.

58:23.556 --> 58:25.474
Calm down. Where...
Tell me where you are.

58:25.475 --> 58:29.354
- Don't change the subject.
- It's okay, just tell me where...

58:29.395 --> 58:30.980
Where are you?

58:32.649 --> 58:34.692
I'm, um... I'm at the...
I'm at the, um...

58:34.734 --> 58:37.986
I'm at the place
with the guy, with the...

58:37.987 --> 58:41.825
- Just can you... I can't.
- Carrie? Hello?

58:41.866 --> 58:44.202
- Just hang up.
- I'm Todd.

58:44.244 --> 58:47.539
- I think I have Carrie's phone?
- Hi, Todd.

58:47.580 --> 58:48.849
- Do not be nice to him.
- Where are you?

58:48.873 --> 58:50.250
We're at the bar at Wilde.

58:50.291 --> 58:51.709
Right.

58:51.751 --> 58:53.628
Bar at Wilde.
Okay, great. Thanks.

58:53.670 --> 58:55.105
Can you give the phone
back to Carrie, please?

58:55.129 --> 58:59.217
- Sure.
- I don't wanna... please.

58:59.259 --> 59:00.802
You there? Carrie?

59:00.844 --> 59:02.637
- What?
- Look, I'm gonna leave right now.

59:02.679 --> 59:04.179
Okay? I'll be there
in about 30 minutes.

59:04.180 --> 59:07.392
- Don't go anywhere.
- Okay, Mr. Bossy.

59:07.433 --> 59:09.853
- So lovely.
- I...

59:13.690 --> 59:15.691
Can I have another one
of those, please?

59:15.692 --> 59:18.945
You're very nice.
I promise I'll leave soon.

59:29.873 --> 59:31.040
Hi.

59:31.808 --> 59:33.089
Carrie?

59:34.834 --> 59:36.378
Carrie?

59:36.379 --> 59:37.797
Hi.

59:37.839 --> 59:40.466
- Hi!
- Hi.

59:40.508 --> 59:42.719
- You found me!
- I did.

59:42.760 --> 59:45.721
- Hi!
- Hi. Okay. Come here.

59:45.722 --> 59:47.515
- Shush!
- Okay.

59:47.557 --> 59:50.727
Don't make it weird by being
all question-y. I'm here.

59:50.768 --> 59:52.854
- Okay. Let's go home.
- God! Right.

59:52.896 --> 59:55.857
- Let's do that.
- Are you okay?

59:55.899 --> 59:58.192
- I'm good. Sorry.
- All right. Here you go.

59:58.234 --> 01:00:00.903
- Let's do this. One on top.
- Yeah.

01:00:00.904 --> 01:00:02.905
- Whoa!
- You know, I used to hate you.

01:00:02.906 --> 01:00:04.908
Well, I'm glad your
opinion has changed.

01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:07.535
You were like,
"I'm Dylan Courtney".

01:00:07.577 --> 01:00:10.830
And then Rowling Vineyards
is all about people who care

01:00:10.872 --> 01:00:13.041
"and you're just a big,
corporate, mean fish".

01:00:13.082 --> 01:00:14.583
I don't quite think
I said it like that.

01:00:14.584 --> 01:00:16.127
- Yeah. Where's my phone?
- I...

01:00:16.169 --> 01:00:18.420
- Sir? I have to call my Zelda.
- Let's go.

01:00:18.421 --> 01:00:19.964
- Okay.
- Time to go. Whoa!

01:00:20.006 --> 01:00:22.216
- Okay. Sh! Come here.
- Hey! What?

01:00:22.258 --> 01:00:24.844
- Come here. Come here.
- Okay.

01:00:24.886 --> 01:00:27.013
I wanna tell you something.
Come here, come close.

01:00:27.055 --> 01:00:30.850
- Okay.
- I actually expect you...

01:00:30.892 --> 01:00:34.187
Respect you professionally,

01:00:34.228 --> 01:00:36.648
- despite the disagreements.
- Okay.

01:00:36.689 --> 01:00:40.026
And you look
really pretty in plaid.

01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:41.653
- Thank you.
- It's nice on you.

01:00:41.694 --> 01:00:43.237
- I think you're a little drunk.
- No!

01:00:43.279 --> 01:00:45.949
- No, a little bit. Let's go.
- Okay. All right.

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:48.451
- Okay.
- We should...

01:00:49.953 --> 01:00:52.120
We should get married.
Would you marry me?

01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:54.082
We could thwart her evil plan.

01:00:54.123 --> 01:00:57.793
I do, I have the jet

01:00:57.794 --> 01:01:01.381
and the suit and it's white and
it's beautiful and it's bride-y...

01:01:01.422 --> 01:01:04.633
- Okay.
- Where's my phone? I need to call Zelda.

01:01:04.634 --> 01:01:06.427
- A jet and...
- Sir, did you take my phone?

01:01:06.469 --> 01:01:08.656
Come on, let's... we'll go get
on the bride-y, white plane.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.724
- Yes. I'm good. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

01:01:11.766 --> 01:01:14.143
- Put you in your white suit...
- Wait, gotta go.

01:01:14.185 --> 01:01:16.187
- There you go. We can go.
- Did you say goodbye?

01:01:16.229 --> 01:01:18.374
- There we go. Good night.
- The bouncer lady. Thank you.

01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:19.983
- Whoa!
- I'm fine.

01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:22.360
- You're good.
- I'm good.

01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:37.417
- We're in my house!
- Yes, we are.

01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:41.003
How did we get here?
Did we get here by magic?

01:01:41.004 --> 01:01:44.424
- Did we get here by Santa?
- No. We got here by my car.

01:01:44.465 --> 01:01:46.217
Vroom, vroom!

01:01:46.259 --> 01:01:49.095
You're a lot more animated
with four martinis in you.

01:01:49.137 --> 01:01:51.347
I'm like some
kind of party animal!

01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:53.181
Boy. Pajamas.
Where are your pajamas?

01:01:53.182 --> 01:01:56.185
- Over there. Right...
- This...

01:01:57.395 --> 01:01:59.355
- Alrighty.
- Yes.

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:03.609
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:02:03.651 --> 01:02:05.527
- You have to unzip me.
- Okay.

01:02:05.528 --> 01:02:07.780
Back there. It's right there.
It's over there.

01:02:07.822 --> 01:02:10.700
- It's on the side.
- It's on the side. I told you where it was.

01:02:10.742 --> 01:02:13.286
There you go.

01:02:13.327 --> 01:02:15.704
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. I'm just gonna...

01:02:15.705 --> 01:02:17.248
Okay.

01:02:21.919 --> 01:02:24.505
My gosh! It's
like they're alive!

01:02:24.547 --> 01:02:26.674
You okay?

01:02:26.716 --> 01:02:29.969
- I got it. I'm good.
- You need help?

01:02:30.011 --> 01:02:32.847
I don't need any help. I'm good.

01:02:34.057 --> 01:02:37.268
Does this mean you need help?

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:41.314
Do you like my slip?
Slippy-slippy...

01:02:41.355 --> 01:02:43.941
My grandma always said to
wear proper undergarments.

01:02:43.983 --> 01:02:46.861
She was a smart lady. Arms.

01:02:46.903 --> 01:02:48.696
One at a time. There you go.

01:02:48.738 --> 01:02:53.242
Okay. You're very nice when
you're not being a butthead.

01:02:53.284 --> 01:02:55.243
Thanks... I think.

01:02:55.244 --> 01:02:58.039
- Can I do something to you?
- What do you wanna do?

01:02:58.081 --> 01:03:02.835
I was thinking that...

01:03:11.803 --> 01:03:15.263
Okay. Come here.

01:03:15.264 --> 01:03:17.016
Come on.!

01:03:37.495 --> 01:03:39.163
Good night, Carrie.

01:04:20.097 --> 01:04:22.199
I need you to return this.
And I need to die.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.202
Cheese and crackers!
What happened to you?

01:04:24.243 --> 01:04:26.120
Please, inside voices. Okay?

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:28.081
I can't return the suit,
you had it altered.

01:04:28.122 --> 01:04:30.207
Thank you. Zelda,
please tell me you have

01:04:30.208 --> 01:04:33.020
some miracle cure in your desk that'll
help me forget that I have a head.

01:04:33.044 --> 01:04:35.671
- I have a breath mint.
- No.

01:04:35.713 --> 01:04:37.715
Have you seen my phone?

01:04:37.757 --> 01:04:39.967
- I take it you're not a missus?
- No.

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:43.179
If I didn't feel so miserable, I might
have time to be super embarrassed.

01:04:43.221 --> 01:04:45.932
- ... he said no?
- No, he said gay.

01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:50.269
- And you didn't know this?
- No, I didn't know this.

01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:52.480
What are you gonna do?

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:54.583
There's not enough time to find
anyone else unless I'm willing

01:04:54.607 --> 01:04:56.484
to make truly
desperate choices, so...

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:59.237
And you don't consider your last
plan a little desperate?

01:04:59.278 --> 01:05:01.071
- Well...
- Sorry.

01:05:01.072 --> 01:05:04.074
Katie and Ethan are gonna take
over, and it's all for nothing.

01:05:04.075 --> 01:05:06.410
Everything I did.

01:05:06.411 --> 01:05:10.623
Carrie, have you considered even for a
second, you don't own the company now?

01:05:10.665 --> 01:05:12.749
It doesn't have
to change anything.

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:15.628
You're right. It doesn't
have to change anything.

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:18.506
That's the point.
Nothing ever changes, Zelda.

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:22.718
I just... I... I thought that
one day, I would own all this,

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.594
and I won't have to answer
to anyone else.

01:05:24.595 --> 01:05:27.765
- Your sister's not gonna...
- I'm just gonna go to work.

01:05:36.816 --> 01:05:39.527
Hey, hi. I have Dylan
Courtney here to see you.

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:41.279
- Says he has your phone.
- What?

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.280
Has to give it to you
in person. He's here.

01:05:43.281 --> 01:05:45.283
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:45.324 --> 01:05:47.535
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:48.995
I do indeed have your phone.

01:05:51.539 --> 01:05:53.457
Thank you for bringing it back.

01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:54.958
Yeah, sure. I figured, you know,

01:05:54.959 --> 01:05:58.295
you'd be lost without
it, so... there you go.

01:05:58.296 --> 01:06:00.798
Where did you find it?

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:04.302
You don't remember?

01:06:06.888 --> 01:06:08.638
- You don't remember.
- I'm confused.

01:06:08.639 --> 01:06:10.807
Do you remember anything
about last night?

01:06:10.808 --> 01:06:14.645
- I'm confused.
- I brought you home.

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:18.941
- I took a cab.
- No, I brought you home.

01:06:18.983 --> 01:06:22.445
- I woke up in my pajamas.
- You did. That was...

01:06:22.487 --> 01:06:24.489
That was entertaining.

01:06:26.574 --> 01:06:29.327
- Excuse me?
- No, I mean, I...

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:33.080
Look, I was just
trying to help you.

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:35.309
- By getting me undressed?
- No, you got yourself undre...

01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:38.586
Okay, hold on. Look,
you got yourself undressed.

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:41.339
Okay? Look, you called me,
you were drunk,

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.066
you were at the bar,
I came, I picked you up

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:45.527
before you made a total idiot out of
yourself. You don't remember this?

01:06:45.551 --> 01:06:47.261
Don't act so superior.

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:49.305
Okay? I don't even know you.

01:06:49.347 --> 01:06:53.017
I'm not...

01:06:53.059 --> 01:06:56.854
Okay, look, I just wanted to help you
out by bringing your phone back.

01:06:56.896 --> 01:06:59.649
I figured you need it,
and that was all.

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:03.986
- Okay. Thanks.
- Wow. Okay.

01:07:07.532 --> 01:07:09.617
You know, you're a lot
nicer when you're drunk.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.453
You're a lot nicer when
your lips aren't moving.

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:14.080
You're welcome.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:24.340
All right, here I come. Okay.

01:07:24.382 --> 01:07:26.133
It's all right. Okay.

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:27.593
I got two kinds of tissues:

01:07:27.635 --> 01:07:30.221
the box and the
rectangle. You choose.

01:07:30.263 --> 01:07:33.140
Why didn't you try to stop me?

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:36.686
I'm pretty sure I tried to stop
you real hard, several times.

01:07:37.645 --> 01:07:40.063
My sister hates me,

01:07:40.064 --> 01:07:43.025
Dylan hates me,
I'm not gonna get the company,

01:07:43.067 --> 01:07:46.320
- Paul probably hates me.
- Your sister doesn't hate you.

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:49.699
I've been so awful
to her, Zelda. How am...

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.368
How am I supposed to go
to that rehearsal dinner?

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:55.329
Maybe with a little less snot?

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:58.833
Zelda, please, please don't tell my dad
about the whole Vegas wedding thing.

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:00.876
He would be so
disappointed, please.

01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:03.629
My lips are sealed.

01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:06.757
Do you know that
I drunk-dialed Dylan last night

01:08:06.799 --> 01:08:08.902
and asked him to take me home?
He put me in my pajamas.

01:08:08.926 --> 01:08:11.280
I may or may not have overheard
that part of your conversation.

01:08:11.304 --> 01:08:12.597
They weren't even cute pajamas!

01:08:12.638 --> 01:08:14.764
Carrie, breathe.

01:08:14.765 --> 01:08:17.685
This isn't fair.
I've been working so hard...

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:19.687
In through your nose.

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:21.814
Okay. Get it together.

01:08:21.856 --> 01:08:23.536
Get it together.
I need to get it together.

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:26.277
- Okay. Get it together.
- You got it.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.613
I...
My God!

01:08:28.654 --> 01:08:30.323
- I can't get it together.
- Okay.

01:08:30.363 --> 01:08:32.282
I can't get it together!
I can't breathe!

01:08:32.283 --> 01:08:34.201
- Here I come.
- My heart hurts!

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.345
It's okay, it's okay. Carrie, Carrie.
Carrie, look at me.

01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:37.680
Look at me. Look
at me, right here. Okay?

01:08:37.705 --> 01:08:39.582
- Yeah?
- Carrie Tate does not

01:08:39.624 --> 01:08:41.584
- back down from a challenge. Okay?
- Okay.

01:08:41.626 --> 01:08:44.127
Carrie Tate is in control
and always on top.

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:47.173
- Okay.
- Okay? She's a problem solver. Right?

01:08:47.214 --> 01:08:50.384
You're gonna get yourself up, you're
gonna get to that rehearsal dinner.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.801
Okay?

01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:29.839
My God! That was so awkward!

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.943
What was going on with you and
Katie at the wedding rehearsal?

01:09:31.966 --> 01:09:34.154
- Are you guys in a fight?
- Sh! I don't really feel like

01:09:34.178 --> 01:09:35.513
talking about this right now.

01:09:35.554 --> 01:09:38.599
Um, well, I feel like you owe us
an explanation.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.685
Um, why exactly
would I owe you that?

01:09:40.725 --> 01:09:42.978
- Because we're Team Wedding!
- Team Wedding!

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:46.107
I... I'm not
following your logic.

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:49.484
I am also sensing some sexual tension
between you and the best man.

01:09:49.527 --> 01:09:51.837
Which is obviously scandalous,
considering you have a boyfriend,

01:09:51.862 --> 01:09:54.364
but I'm gonna fully
encourage it anyway.

01:09:54.365 --> 01:09:57.410
Had a boyfriend.

01:09:57.451 --> 01:10:00.705
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
I think he might be gay.

01:10:00.746 --> 01:10:02.957
- Totally gay.
- Yeah.

01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:06.419
Really? I...

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.005
Why... Okay. I'm not quite sure why
I'm talking to you two about this.

01:10:10.047 --> 01:10:12.526
- I'm just gonna...
- Did you really tell Katie her dress makes her look

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:14.551
- like Stevie Nicks?
- Okay.

01:10:14.552 --> 01:10:19.014
Um, Stevie Nicks is a very well respected
recording artist and style icon.

01:10:19.056 --> 01:10:22.058
- That was really mean.
- That's meaner than when Katie

01:10:22.059 --> 01:10:25.730
told me my croissants tasted
like mushrooms and confusion.

01:10:27.606 --> 01:10:29.525
Yeah, you're right.
I'll apologize.

01:10:29.567 --> 01:10:31.277
- My God!
- What?

01:10:31.318 --> 01:10:33.070
Okay, so Dylan
is right behind you.

01:10:33.112 --> 01:10:36.323
- I... okay...
- Unbridle your sexual tension and go!

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.284
You, go!

01:10:38.325 --> 01:10:40.076
- I'm so...
- I'm sorry.

01:10:40.077 --> 01:10:43.079
- I tripped. No, no, it's...
- No, it's... no worries.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.582
You look lovely.

01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:49.252
Thank you. So do you.

01:10:49.253 --> 01:10:51.672
Thank you.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:56.135
Look, I want to apologize if you feel like
I crossed some sort of line last night.

01:10:56.177 --> 01:10:59.680
- I didn't...
- No, it's, um... You were trying to help.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:02.099
Yeah, I was.
I was trying to help.

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:04.894
I know.

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:09.273
Would you like to go sit down?

01:11:09.315 --> 01:11:11.275
I'll be there in a minute.

01:11:12.693 --> 01:11:15.154
Okay. I'll see you in a minute.

01:11:17.698 --> 01:11:19.033
- Carrie, darling.
- Yes?

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:20.951
They're serving the salads.
Come sit down.

01:11:20.993 --> 01:11:22.328
Okay.

01:11:29.884 --> 01:11:33.262
I actually have
a couple of things to say.

01:11:33.263 --> 01:11:36.016
Um, no it's not
the Tijuana trip.

01:11:36.057 --> 01:11:38.310
I'll save that for tomorrow
for that speech.

01:11:38.351 --> 01:11:41.980
Um, Ethan, Katie,

01:11:42.022 --> 01:11:45.942
I just wanted to tell you
how much I admire your bravery.

01:11:45.984 --> 01:11:48.361
And I know that it
takes a lot of bravery

01:11:48.403 --> 01:11:53.366
to open yourself up, and to let your
guard down, and to promise forever.

01:11:53.408 --> 01:11:56.118
And the fact you two love
each other so completely

01:11:56.119 --> 01:11:59.456
that you are willing to walk
down that road together...

01:12:04.628 --> 01:12:07.505
That's amazing.

01:12:07.547 --> 01:12:10.467
And I gotta tell you,
I'm actually a little envious

01:12:10.508 --> 01:12:12.302
of, of that kind of love.

01:12:12.344 --> 01:12:16.805
But... most of all,
it makes me happy.

01:12:16.806 --> 01:12:19.475
It makes me happy to think
that it exists,

01:12:19.476 --> 01:12:26.066
and it makes me happy that I'm going
to experience it in your orbit.

01:12:26.107 --> 01:12:28.984
And it makes me happy to
think that maybe one day,

01:12:28.985 --> 01:12:32.989
if I'm lucky enough, a little
bit of that will rub off on me.

01:12:34.157 --> 01:12:37.202
Anyway, cheers to both of you.

01:12:37.243 --> 01:12:38.411
- I love you.
- Cheers.

01:12:38.453 --> 01:12:40.121
- Cheers, buddy.
- Cheers.

01:12:40.163 --> 01:12:41.998
Cheers.

01:12:44.959 --> 01:12:48.797
Sorry. Just... can I talk
to you for one second?

01:12:51.174 --> 01:12:56.137
I am so, so sorry. I have been
an idiot this whole time.

01:12:56.179 --> 01:12:58.681
I do not want to fight.
Okay, what is going on?

01:12:58.682 --> 01:13:01.434
You... you have no idea what
a mess of everything I made.

01:13:01.476 --> 01:13:06.022
No, Carrie, it is a beautiful night and
tomorrow will only be more perfect.

01:13:06.064 --> 01:13:08.233
No, no, Katie,
you don't understand.

01:13:08.274 --> 01:13:10.860
- I am trying.
- Katie...

01:13:13.571 --> 01:13:15.531
I asked Paul to marry me.

01:13:15.532 --> 01:13:17.659
But Paul is gay.

01:13:17.701 --> 01:13:19.911
Am I the only person in the
world that didn't know that?

01:13:19.953 --> 01:13:22.914
Well, I don't understand. I thought
you two were just friends.

01:13:22.956 --> 01:13:25.541
Yeah. I was...

01:13:25.542 --> 01:13:29.170
I thought that if I got married
first, I wouldn't lose Emerson Foods.

01:13:29.212 --> 01:13:32.549
- What are you talking about?
- I literally thought that if I could get Paul

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.217
to marry me...

01:13:34.259 --> 01:13:37.387
I could keep you and Ethan
from getting the company.

01:13:37.429 --> 01:13:39.172
That's so pathetic.

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:41.091
Thanks so much.

01:13:41.133 --> 01:13:44.302
Even you have to admit that is
high on the pathetic scale.

01:13:44.344 --> 01:13:47.180
And I have been
so awful to Dylan.

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:50.058
Yeah, Ethan told me about that.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.560
Did he tell you everything?

01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:55.355
He said you told Dylan
he looked sexy in plaid.

01:13:55.397 --> 01:13:57.858
- I said what?! See? I...
- Okay.

01:13:57.899 --> 01:14:01.111
I don't think we can allow you talk
to anyone you are not related to.

01:14:01.153 --> 01:14:03.946
And I think I actually
like him. I think...

01:14:03.947 --> 01:14:05.991
I think I sexy-plaid-like him.

01:14:06.032 --> 01:14:10.996
Carrie, you're one of those
people that is so smart...

01:14:11.037 --> 01:14:12.747
- and you're stupid.
- Thanks a lot.

01:14:12.789 --> 01:14:15.917
Okay. Look, Carrie,
this isn't worth it. Okay?

01:14:15.959 --> 01:14:18.336
- Ethan and I will step away completely.
- No, no, no!

01:14:18.378 --> 01:14:21.465
That's... see, that's...
not what I want.

01:14:21.506 --> 01:14:23.967
Then why are you doing this?

01:14:24.009 --> 01:14:26.595
Okay, what is it that you want?

01:14:29.181 --> 01:14:31.974
- I don't know.
- Carrie, look.

01:14:31.975 --> 01:14:34.102
I love you.

01:14:34.144 --> 01:14:35.812
And I know that
this is a lot for you,

01:14:35.854 --> 01:14:40.442
but I cannot spend my
rehearsal dinner in a hallway

01:14:40.484 --> 01:14:42.319
next to the restroom.
Are you coming?

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.030
- Yes, yes, in a minute.
- Okay.

01:15:39.584 --> 01:15:43.171
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Carrie.

01:15:43.213 --> 01:15:46.174
No, everything's fine.

01:15:46.216 --> 01:15:48.677
Um, do you have a minute?

01:16:03.984 --> 01:16:05.901
Wow, Katie.

01:16:05.902 --> 01:16:10.072
- You look amazing.
- Just call me Stevie.

01:16:10.073 --> 01:16:12.074
No, no...

01:16:12.075 --> 01:16:15.412
That was... that was
Scrooge Carrie, okay? I'm...

01:16:15.453 --> 01:16:18.914
Now I'm Tiny Tim.
God bless us, everyone!

01:16:18.915 --> 01:16:22.877
I feel like I am gonna
throw up. Why am I so nervous?

01:16:22.919 --> 01:16:25.964
Why? Because this is huge, honey.

01:16:26.006 --> 01:16:31.261
Carrie, if I faint,
will you create a diversion?

01:16:31.303 --> 01:16:34.597
You... you're not gonna faint.

01:16:34.598 --> 01:16:36.516
But yes, you can count on me.

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:40.729
Here. Look, I'll distract you.
I have something for you.

01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:42.814
What is this?

01:16:46.318 --> 01:16:48.612
This is a letter of resignation.

01:16:48.653 --> 01:16:51.698
Yep. Um, it has nothing
to do with you and Ethan.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:54.868
Here. It has a little
to do with you and Ethan.

01:16:54.909 --> 01:16:57.787
Carrie, Ethan feels awful
that for even a second,

01:16:57.829 --> 01:17:00.289
you would think he
would want to hurt you.

01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:02.625
No. He shouldn't. I haven't
even given the guy a chance.

01:17:02.626 --> 01:17:05.629
He just got so excited
about the possibilities.

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:08.130
He has some really
great ideas, Katie.

01:17:08.131 --> 01:17:10.550
Carrie, truly we both think

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.552
that the company
should go to you.

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:15.513
And that means so much to me, but
it doesn't change my decision.

01:17:15.555 --> 01:17:17.973
- Okay?
- I don't understand.

01:17:17.974 --> 01:17:21.061
I thought Emerson Foods
was everything to you.

01:17:22.312 --> 01:17:24.898
I'm ready for my own adventures.

01:17:25.982 --> 01:17:27.817
I don't know what to say.

01:17:27.859 --> 01:17:31.820
Well, um, say that you
accept my resignation,

01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:36.159
and you're prepared to offer me
a very lucrative exit package.

01:17:36.201 --> 01:17:39.079
Of course.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.247
- I love you.
- I love you!

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:45.543
This is a big day! What are... Stop!
Let's get you perfect, Stevie.

01:17:45.585 --> 01:17:49.171
Don't! Don't!

01:17:49.172 --> 01:17:52.258
- Don't touch your face!
- Okay. Is this too much?

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.553
- No. It's beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:17:55.595 --> 01:17:59.848
Mark! Look at our girls.

01:17:59.849 --> 01:18:02.351
Are you guys ready?

01:18:02.352 --> 01:18:06.481
To be honest, I've been dreading
this since the day you were born.

01:18:06.523 --> 01:18:08.357
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:18:08.358 --> 01:18:10.652
It's not easy
giving away your baby.

01:18:10.694 --> 01:18:12.987
- You're gonna make me cry!
- I love you, Daddy.

01:18:13.029 --> 01:18:15.407
- I love you too.
- This is so precious!

01:18:15.448 --> 01:18:19.619
Okay. Okay, we all need to come
together, take a cleansing breath.

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.329
- My!
- Seriously?

01:18:21.371 --> 01:18:25.375
Come on, it's her day.

01:18:25.417 --> 01:18:27.543
I love you all so much.

01:18:27.544 --> 01:18:30.797
I couldn't ask for
a more glorious day,

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:34.050
- or a more perfect family.
- Katie.

01:18:34.092 --> 01:18:36.570
Dad, seriously, I love them both,
but you have to make them stop.

01:18:36.594 --> 01:18:38.638
Ladies, we have a
wedding to get to, right?

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.825
Okay, all right, so just,
I got the hair, got the makeup.

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:43.768
- I just...
- Yes, go.

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:46.061
- Come on.
- Get it together, woman.

01:18:47.439 --> 01:18:49.858
My goodness!

01:18:49.899 --> 01:18:51.735
All right, lady.

01:18:51.776 --> 01:18:55.738
Here we go. Time to
start the rest of my life.

01:18:55.739 --> 01:19:00.702
Yeah. I know what you mean.

01:19:00.744 --> 01:19:04.038
- Okay. I'll see you out there.
- Okay.

01:21:25.555 --> 01:21:28.850
Bridesmaids are
supposed to be hideous.

01:21:28.892 --> 01:21:32.020
You are not playing
by the rules, my dear.

01:21:34.772 --> 01:21:38.276
I have a reputation
for being difficult.

01:21:38.318 --> 01:21:42.864
But all the same, I couldn't leave
you without a date to the ball.

01:21:46.159 --> 01:21:49.329
Paul, I'm so sorry.
I wasn't good to you...

01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:51.831
Nope. Not another word.

01:21:51.873 --> 01:21:54.334
I don't accept
apologies at weddings.

01:21:56.127 --> 01:21:58.338
- I dance.
- No.

01:21:58.379 --> 01:22:00.423
- Yes.
- No!

01:22:00.465 --> 01:22:02.508
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:05.761
- Right now? Come on!
- Come.

01:22:05.762 --> 01:22:08.430
Yeah, look at that.

01:22:21.819 --> 01:22:25.113
- May I cut in?
- Yeah.

01:22:25.114 --> 01:22:29.494
If you need me, I'll be standing
over there next to the cake log.

01:22:34.791 --> 01:22:37.961
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:22:38.002 --> 01:22:40.463
So I've gotta finalize
the contracts on Monday,

01:22:40.505 --> 01:22:45.467
but I'd like to congratulate the
new CEO of Rowling Vineyards.

01:22:45.468 --> 01:22:47.387
Thank you.

01:22:47.428 --> 01:22:49.973
I gotta admit, I was pretty
surprised that you called me.

01:22:50.014 --> 01:22:53.059
Yeah, I surprised myself.

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.812
Well, they're lucky to have you.

01:22:55.853 --> 01:22:57.813
Well, they're a great
company. You know?

01:22:57.814 --> 01:23:00.817
- They just need a little help.
- Yeah.

01:23:00.858 --> 01:23:04.112
Hey, is Paul gonna
be upset about this?

01:23:05.697 --> 01:23:09.409
Yeah, um, Paul and I
are just friends.

01:23:09.450 --> 01:23:13.121
- Really?
- Really.

01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:17.709
- Yeah. Look, I'm sorry.
- For what?

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:21.212
Really? I don't know, maybe because
I've spent the last couple of weeks

01:23:21.254 --> 01:23:23.174
acting like you came from
the sewer or something.

01:23:23.214 --> 01:23:26.050
Yeah, well, you know, we didn't
get off on the right foot.

01:23:26.092 --> 01:23:29.387
No. I'm not usually
like that. It's...

01:23:29.429 --> 01:23:32.598
You're passionate.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.685
- You're... you're nice.
- I am. I'm a very nice guy.

01:23:36.686 --> 01:23:40.023
And...

01:23:42.191 --> 01:23:44.277
I like you.

01:23:44.318 --> 01:23:47.030
I like you a lot.

01:23:48.614 --> 01:23:50.533
I like you too.

01:23:50.575 --> 01:23:53.536
Damn it.

01:23:53.578 --> 01:23:55.955
- Can I tell you a secret?
- What?

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:59.584
You make... the best
Christmas cookies

01:23:59.625 --> 01:24:03.379
- I have ever tasted. Next to my grandmother.
- Yeah? Okay.

01:24:03.421 --> 01:24:05.631
- You're in a close second.
- Ready? Ready?

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:08.259
- Okay, it's almond extract...
- I think I know this.

01:24:08.301 --> 01:24:12.220
- And lemon. No, you did not!
- Lemon. I knew it.

01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:14.474
- No, you did not!
- I knew it was lemon extract!

01:24:14.515 --> 01:24:16.391
- Now I have to kill you.
- You have to... well...

01:24:16.392 --> 01:24:19.561
Okay,
I'm gonna give you a compliment.

01:24:19.562 --> 01:24:21.731
- Don't pass out. I know.
- What?

01:24:21.773 --> 01:24:25.567
- Um... so your speech...
- Yeah?

01:24:25.568 --> 01:24:28.071
At the rehearsal dinner...

01:24:29.238 --> 01:24:31.991
- it really got me.
- Which part?

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:34.869
- The whole thing.
- Really?

01:24:34.911 --> 01:24:37.038
- Yeah.
- Well, you know, I...

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.373
I lettered in speech
in high school.

01:24:39.415 --> 01:24:40.750
I did.

01:24:40.792 --> 01:24:43.669
- Makes sense then.
- I got beat up a lot.

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:46.881
But I am very sexy in plaid.

01:24:49.092 --> 01:24:51.594
- I love plaid.
- I know.

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:56.932
- Merry Christmas.
- Happy New Year.

01:24:56.933 --> 01:24:59.102
Happy New Year.

01:25:09.946 --> 01:25:13.199
Okay.!

01:25:14.325 --> 01:25:17.495
And the man can dance.
