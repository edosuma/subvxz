01:23.542 --> 01:26.967

03:02.933 --> 03:06.813

03:08.271 --> 03:10.148
Good morning, Carson.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.826
James, please make sure
this bedpan has been cleaned,

03:12.901 --> 03:15.871
and wait. I don't like the fact
that these sheets haven't been changed.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.382
Now, I know the laundry's been done.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.704
Please make sure
and change these sheets, okay?

03:19.783 --> 03:23.253
Come on, people, we gotta do better,
we gotta do better than this!

03:23.328 --> 03:27.674
Oh, my God, is that another dirty bedpan?
And look at these sheets!

03:27.749 --> 03:30.593
Kathy, listen, I don't want these residents
to get bed sores, okay?

03:30.919 --> 03:32.546
Kathy and James, get on it!

03:32.796 --> 03:34.594
- How are you doing, Ms. Carla?
- Hey, Allen.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.638
"For everything, there is a season.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.391
"There's a time to be
born and a time to die.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.143
"A time to laugh and a time to cry.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.101
"A time to tear down and
a time to build up."

03:45.183 --> 03:48.278
You like that, Mrs. Watson? Mrs. Watson?

03:52.441 --> 03:55.035
Easy Rest Retirement Home,
where better living...

03:55.110 --> 03:57.363
Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?

03:57.446 --> 04:00.416
I don't care.
Do not call my job looking for Malik!

04:00.490 --> 04:03.334
Do not call my job!

04:03.410 --> 04:07.131
Easy Rest Retirement Home, where
better living is an option. May I help you?

04:07.205 --> 04:09.685
Yes, yes, I'll make sure they're ready
for that shuttle pickup.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.422
No problem, thank you.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.146
Are they ready to take me to dialysis?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.800
Your appointment is tomorrow, Carson.

04:14.963 --> 04:18.887
- Tomorrow? I could be dead by tomorrow!
- Carson, you will not, okay?

04:18.966 --> 04:21.320
The shuttle will be here in the morning.
You feeling all right?

04:21.344 --> 04:24.184
Yeah, I'm feeling all right.
I can just use a cup of coffee, that's all.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.520
Carson, you cannot have coffee.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.819
That's the main reason
why you're going to dialysis,

04:28.894 --> 04:30.737
so they can flush
all those fluids out of you.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.623
Well, then I should be able
to have some coffee

04:32.647 --> 04:34.567
if they're gonna flush
all them fluids out of me.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.902
Carson, I'm not gonna argue
with you, okay?

04:37.152 --> 04:39.200
I can't have this, I can't have that!
This is crazy.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.658
Well, I'm sorry. That's the life of a man
with diabetes and kidney failure.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.303
Dalia, would you make sure
and watch them?

04:45.327 --> 04:47.079
Make sure
they change those sheets upstairs?

04:47.162 --> 04:48.522
Yes, I'll make sure they're on it.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.842
- And why hasn't Carson left yet?
- The shuttle will be here tomorrow.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.633
And it'll probably be late.
With these state-run shuttle programs,

04:55.712 --> 04:57.806
I don't know
how they expect us to run this place.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.930
We have four people helping 30 patients,
the back rooms are full,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.862
I'm at my wits' end,
I don't know what else to do!

05:02.886 --> 05:04.263
Carla, calm down, okay?

05:04.346 --> 05:08.442
I've actually been thinking about that
and I found a way for us to get some help.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.860
Oh, okay, how?

05:09.935 --> 05:12.905
You know the courts are giving
community service to people, right?

05:13.188 --> 05:14.832
Well, I called
to have them send someone over.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.200
Now, I don't know
about having a criminal in here.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.905
Carla, these are minor offenses, and
they'll come here and work for us for free.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.952
No, I don't know about this, Dalia.

05:23.031 --> 05:27.411
Carla, come on! I really think
we should try it and I already called.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.497
- Dalia!
- Carla, come on. Free...

05:30.580 --> 05:32.878
You know what?
All right, fine, we will try it.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.965
- Thank you.
- But if it doesn't work, I am blaming you.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.356
And why isn't Mrs. Watson
sitting in front of the TV? Come on...

05:38.380 --> 05:39.723
I was reading to her.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.264
This woman hasn't said a word
in over a year since she's been here.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.605
Her daughter asked me to
and I promised her that I would.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.825
Then you should probably have
her daughter read to her.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.853
Carla, she would if she were here!
She just got married.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.779
She went on her honeymoon before
her husband went back to Afghanistan.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.444
- She got married?
- Yes, Carla.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.822
It was the most beautiful wedding ever.

06:00.068 --> 06:04.289
Malik and I had a great...
Wait, she invited you. Why didn't you come?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.662
- I had things to do.
- Like what?

06:06.741 --> 06:08.368
Like minding my business.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.125
Listen, you have to stop wasting your time
reading to this woman.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.174
There are several patients
who need your attention.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.977
You have to learn
how to choose your battles.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.299
The universe is speaking!

06:18.378 --> 06:20.301
The universe? Carla, wait.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.141
I haven't seen you at church lately.
What's going on'?

06:23.425 --> 06:26.474
- I'm not going to that church anymore.
- Why? What happened?

06:26.636 --> 06:30.391
I am now studying with a guru
on the powers of the universe.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.441
All that noise in that
place, I'm past that.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.121
But Carla, you've been going to that church
since I was a little girl.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.614
- Yeah, I know, but this is better for me.
- Carla?

06:37.939 --> 06:39.941
Look, Dalia,
at some point, you have to grow up.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.211
You'll see that you're wasting
your time at that place, too.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.754
Look, girl,
I know that you're still hurt by this...

06:43.778 --> 06:45.715
- Hey, hey, hey!
- ...but you gotta find a way to...

06:45.739 --> 06:47.616
We are not talking about that.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.577
Hello, ladies.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.419
- How are you doing, Ms. Carla?
- Hey, Allen.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.835
- Hey, hey, Dalia, you talked to her for me?
- No, I didn't say anything to her.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.595
You were in there, you could have said
a little bit more than "Hey!"

06:58.043 --> 07:01.343
Easy Rest Retirement Home,
where better living...

07:01.421 --> 07:04.174
No, no, I'll get her,
I'll get her, thank you.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.515
Hattie! Hattie!

07:07.594 --> 07:10.188
Hattie, get inside, please!

07:10.263 --> 07:13.984
That's the fourth call I've gotten this
week. You do not want to get sick!

07:18.980 --> 07:21.108
I was trying to make a run for it.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.073
And Hattie, where were you going?

07:25.195 --> 07:27.573
Just as far away from here
as I can possibly get.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.125
All right, well,
it's time for you to take your medicine.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.545
- I've already taken my medicine.
- No, you did not.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.431
- Already taken my medicine!
- You did not!

07:35.455 --> 07:37.082
- Did, too!
- Did not, Hattie!

07:37.165 --> 07:38.165
- Did, too!
- Did not!

07:38.208 --> 07:40.381
Did, too! Did, too! Did, too! Did, too!

07:41.211 --> 07:43.509
Hattie, you did not. They're right here.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.801
I've already taken it, but if
you want me to take it again and overdose,

07:46.883 --> 07:48.977
it ain't gonna nobody's fault but your own!

07:49.344 --> 07:50.436
Well, wait, wait...

07:50.512 --> 07:53.561
No, don't back down now.
Go on, give it to me!

07:55.976 --> 07:59.321
When I die and when I get to glory,
I'm gonna tell God,

07:59.396 --> 08:01.444
"Don't charge me, charge her!

08:02.941 --> 08:06.616
"'Cause I wasn't ready to be here,
she fast-forwarded me here!

08:06.861 --> 08:09.740
"She fast-forwarded me here!"

08:09.823 --> 08:12.997
Hattie, why do you do this to me?

08:13.076 --> 08:15.204
You know I'm married
and I have bills to pay.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.838
You wait one doggone minute!

08:16.913 --> 08:20.713
Don't you go whining to me. You wouldn't
be able to maintain my schedule!

08:20.875 --> 08:23.799
I had to manage
seven children, two husbands,

08:23.878 --> 08:26.472
and three boyfriends all at the same time!

08:27.924 --> 08:32.225
You don't even know what medication
to give me and what time to give it to me!

08:32.303 --> 08:33.520
You're talkin' about tired?

08:33.596 --> 08:36.816
Baby, it ain't easy cheating
when you're married.

08:38.727 --> 08:42.573
Hattie, that's awful!
You know that's not of God.

08:42.938 --> 08:46.034
I wasn't much thinking about God then.

08:46.109 --> 08:50.205
I was just trying to get my groove on.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.159
I was dropping it
like it were hot back then, baby.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.287
Hattie?

08:58.079 --> 09:00.377
<i>- Whoo, boo, ring my bell...
- Hattie?</i>

09:02.292 --> 09:06.092
Hattie, did you or did
you not take the pills?

09:06.254 --> 09:08.723
That's for me to know and you to find out!

09:08.798 --> 09:11.096
Fine, I'm not gonna
play these games with you, okay?

09:11.176 --> 09:12.519
Come on, open up, take the pills.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.946
I've already taken my medicine!

09:13.970 --> 09:16.849
Hattie, please open your mouth
and take the pills.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.899
Now, don't you spit those out.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.943
All right. Now, ma'am,
you're going to be just fine here.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.149
No, I'm not.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.860
Baby, who is this?

09:28.943 --> 09:33.323
New patient. She got put out of her house
and we were told to bring her here.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.784
- Baby.
- Yeah, I know, it's sad.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.460
Hold on, not another one?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.646
I just spoke to them at the State,

09:39.704 --> 09:42.099
I told them we didn't have any more room
for another resident!

09:42.123 --> 09:43.215
This is ridiculous.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.269
I need to call the County,
that's what I need to do.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.545
Carla, she can hear you.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.632
Dalia, let me do my job.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.801
She ain't in a good mood today.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.309
- Hi, I'm Dalia. And you are?
- Not staying here.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.600
Her name is Barbara.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.394
Well, Ms. Barbara, you'll
be very happy here.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.955
We have some really kind people
that will take good care of you...

10:04.979 --> 10:08.483
Some really kind people here
that will bust you upside your head.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.570
Now, let me go
and lay the rules down for you, sugar.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.623
So long as you don't touch my man
or my Fruity Pops,

10:14.697 --> 10:16.791
me and you gonna be just fine.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.545
Me and you gonna run on
to see what the end gonna be!

10:23.873 --> 10:26.626
Please forgive her,
she hasn't taken her meds yet.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.464
She's a little high-strung, but, Ms.
Barbara, you'll be fine here, okay?

10:30.547 --> 10:35.018
- She's the only one that way.
- I'm not gonna make it here. I'm gonna die.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.228
I can't believe they just left me here.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.940
Yeah, that's what they do.
They just drop you off and leave you.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.062
Don't talk about my children.
Please, shut up!

10:47.480 --> 10:50.279
- Who do you think you're talkin' to?
- I'm talkin' to you!

10:50.358 --> 10:53.908
You feel froggy, then?
Jump on over here and do something!

10:55.530 --> 10:57.624
Who is this pathetic little person?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.456
This here is whoop-ass in a can!

11:02.162 --> 11:05.757
You sure you don't want to pop it open?
Pop it open! Pop it open, then!

11:06.332 --> 11:08.209
- Hattie...
- Cross over the line, then!

11:08.293 --> 11:10.716
Cross over the line, Caroline!

11:11.880 --> 11:14.884
Please believe, baby, I ain't never scared!

11:17.468 --> 11:22.850
I can assure you, precious, this right here,
this ain't what you want right here, baby!

11:22.932 --> 11:27.233
No, I'm gonna drop that Dusty Rhodes
on you, baby, this ain't what you want!

11:27.312 --> 11:28.313
Hattie...

11:28.479 --> 11:32.780
You run into this brick wall
if you want to and commit suicide!

11:32.859 --> 11:36.079
- All right, come on, Ms. Hattie...
- Don't be touchin' all over me!

11:36.321 --> 11:39.291
Don't you see my man here looking at you?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.544
See me after he go to dialysis.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.418
Dalia? Dalia, go ahead and check her in.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.021
And Allen, once she's done,
would you check her vitals, please?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.565
Yes, anything you need, Ms. Carla.
Will you be needing anything else?

11:54.589 --> 11:58.219
No, I need you to check her vitals.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.099
All right. Yes, ma'am.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.483
Denied!
Man, why don't you leave her alone?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.730
You just keep after her.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.987
- She doesn't want you, man.
- Yeah, but I want her.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.279
Man, you don't make enough money.
She dates doctors and lawyers.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.678
You can't pull a woman like that.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.444
Everything ain't about money, son.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.618
Why would you want to date her anyway?
She's mean as a snake, man.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.717
- There's something about her.
- Something about her?

12:21.741 --> 12:22.788
Something about her.

12:22.867 --> 12:26.041
You know what, I keep trying
to tell you for your own good.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.682
But you go right ahead,
keep getting your feelings hurt, okay?

12:28.706 --> 12:29.767
See, that's the problem right there.

12:29.791 --> 12:33.341
You young thunder cats are always
trying to tell old school what to do.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.797
We was here first, boy.
We got this game on lockdown.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.100
Yeah, old school just got the door slammed
in his face, man.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.600
Ms. Barbara, let me go on
and get you checked in. My name is Allen.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.353
If you come with me
and just turn right here at the desk,

12:45.431 --> 12:48.310
we'll get you checked in, is
that all right? Yes, ma'am.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.317
- Hey, I'm Carson.
- Don't talk to me.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.117
- What's wrong with her?
- Don't worry about what's wrong with her!

12:56.192 --> 12:58.820
You better not let me catch you
talking to her again!

12:59.237 --> 13:01.205
I'm gonna bust you upside your head!

13:01.489 --> 13:03.116
Woman, you don't own me.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.874
I do own you
'cause I puts it on you, Carson!

13:09.664 --> 13:11.041
<i>What you say?</i>

13:11.124 --> 13:12.797
<i>You say what you want</i>

13:24.846 --> 13:30.194
And stop sneaking in my room at night and
slipping them blue pills under my tongue!

13:30.268 --> 13:31.485
I didn't do that.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.313
Yes, you did and I can prove it!

13:33.438 --> 13:35.941
Prove it, then, Carson! Prove it, then!

13:36.065 --> 13:37.157
Woman, I don't want you.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.113
Yes, you do!
You just don't know it yet, Carson!

13:41.195 --> 13:44.290
Prove it, Carson! Prove it!
Prove it, Carson! Prove it!

13:44.365 --> 13:45.366
Dalia!

13:46.534 --> 13:47.660
Hattie!

13:49.620 --> 13:50.917
- Dalia.
- Hattie!

13:52.165 --> 13:53.212
She's crazy.

13:53.291 --> 13:57.717
Hattie, please get down
off of Carson, okay?

13:58.296 --> 13:59.297
Dalia!

13:59.422 --> 14:02.596
Hattie, now, now!

14:02.717 --> 14:05.345
Off of Carson, he is not a horse.

14:05.428 --> 14:09.558
Yes, he is.
He's my black stallion and I like to ride!

14:09.724 --> 14:11.772
Down.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.651
Woman, I ain't dating you!

14:16.189 --> 14:19.989
So, you think you're just gonna
take my virginity and leave me?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.537
Woman, you're crazy!
You ain't been a virgin since...

14:22.820 --> 14:25.539
- Since I slept with you!
- I don't want you!

14:26.074 --> 14:27.371
- Yes, you do!
- No, I don't!

14:27.492 --> 14:28.709
Yes, you do!

14:28.785 --> 14:32.961
See, back then, you didn't want me,
but now I'm hot, you're all over me!

14:36.459 --> 14:37.836
<i>It's hot in here</i>

14:37.919 --> 14:38.919
Hattie?

14:38.961 --> 14:43.262
<i>There must be a party in the atmosphere
'Cause I miss him</i>

14:43.383 --> 14:44.383
Hattie!

14:44.425 --> 14:46.769
<i>Yes, I miss him I miss him</i>

14:48.346 --> 14:52.772
Hattie, I am so stressed out this morning,

14:52.850 --> 14:54.852
I have a headache
and I asked you really nicely

14:55.103 --> 14:57.105
to please take your medication and...

14:58.815 --> 14:59.816
Hattie!

15:00.775 --> 15:02.618
Hattie, what's wrong with you?

15:03.111 --> 15:05.955
You didn't have to hit me like that!

15:07.281 --> 15:09.033
You didn't have to hit me like that!

15:09.117 --> 15:11.745
- Hattie, but you...
- I'm-a call the po-po on you!

15:11.911 --> 15:13.222
What are you talking about, Hattie?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.123
You're going to jail now!

15:15.331 --> 15:16.799
No, I'm... Hattie.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.756
Till you do right by me.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.132
Hattie.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.466
Oh, somebody tryin' to get...

15:24.549 --> 15:26.472
Hattie, please stop crying!

15:26.634 --> 15:26.725
Hattie, please!

15:26.726 --> 15:27.934
Hattie, please!

15:36.561 --> 15:37.904
How you doing, honey?

15:38.354 --> 15:40.982
How you doing? How you doing?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.618
What the hell's wrong with you?

15:50.032 --> 15:52.261
She looks like one of the things you hit,
used to box back in the day.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.595
Remember them thing? How you doing?

15:53.619 --> 15:56.839
No, no, please don't do that
to one of our residents here.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.836
I know who that is, that's Edith Bunker.
How you doin', Edith? Where's Archie?

16:01.544 --> 16:04.263
No, ma'am.
Ma'am, please stop doing that, okay?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.181
Please. Ma'am, what are you doing?

16:06.466 --> 16:09.595
Please, this is
one of our residents here, Mrs. Watson,

16:09.677 --> 16:12.521
and she has Alzheimer's.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.685
Orderly, can you please come and
get Mrs. Watson and take her upstairs?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.079
I'm sorry,
I didn't know she had an all-the-time.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.401
I'm sorry,
I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

16:21.522 --> 16:25.243
I'm here looking for somebody named delectable,
delightful, delusional, delicious.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.503
What the hell kind of name is that?

16:26.527 --> 16:28.529
What does that say, "D-e-l"?

16:28.613 --> 16:30.490
No, that says "Dalia" and that's me.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.500
- "Dalia." Dalia, wow. Dalia.
- Yes.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.678
That's a nice name. What does that mean?

16:34.702 --> 16:37.706
- It means "gentle" in Swahili, actually.
- Wow.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.040
- What's your name?
- Mabel.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.050
Hi, Mabel, and your name means?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.044
Tough as hell in College Park.
How you doin'?

16:47.048 --> 16:49.016
- I'm here from the court.
- Yes!

16:49.091 --> 16:52.140
Yeah, they told me to come over here
and do 20 hours of community service.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.220
Glad to have you...

16:53.262 --> 16:56.158
But I'm not gonna do that 'cause I got
things to do, so go on, sign this paper.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.826
I'm gonna take it down to the County
to the judge

16:57.850 --> 16:58.911
and I'm gonna get the hell on out of here.

16:58.935 --> 17:02.015
Sign your name, baby, that's all you gotta
do. Gonna buy me some scratch-offs.

17:04.397 --> 17:07.242
I'm sorry, I can't sign this.
Only Ms. Carla can and she's...

17:07.484 --> 17:09.253
Put her name down there,
ain't nobody lookin'.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.797
Go ahead, go ahead. Ain't nobody lookin'.

17:10.820 --> 17:13.665
But that's forgery and
that's very untrustworthy of me to do that.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.508
"Untrustworthy," wow. Are you Christian?

17:15.660 --> 17:16.752
How did you know?

17:16.827 --> 17:20.252
Y'all work on my nerves, child,
doing the right thing all the time!

17:21.457 --> 17:25.007
Well, Ms. Mabel, I take it you're
here to be a good employee.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.963
Hell, no, I'm not here to do that at all.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.369
I'm gonna do the 20 hours
and get the hell up out of here.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.557
Okay, well, the job is simple.
All you have to do is a little cleaning.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.095
I'm allergic.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.113
- To cleaning products?
- To cleaning. Can't do that, sorry. Next.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.518
Okay, well, what about cooking?
Can you be our chef?

17:40.685 --> 17:42.204
No, you can reach up to the top shelf,

17:42.228 --> 17:44.697
get me a double shot of Hennessy
and Patrén on the rocks.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.150
I'll be straight up peaceful in here.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.742
- Okay, well, what about secretarial?
- The horse?

17:53.114 --> 17:56.118
No, ain't nobody's gonna be
ridin' me up in here, honey. No.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.462
I used to be a stallion, but I'm on my way
to a mule right about now,

17:59.579 --> 18:03.425
- so, I can't do that.
- Okay, Ms. Mabel, what can you do?

18:03.541 --> 18:05.352
I could sit right here
waitin' for these 20 hours to be up,

18:05.376 --> 18:06.798
that's what the hell I could do.

18:07.128 --> 18:10.223
Okay, we need you to do some work
in order to get that signature.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.340
Fine.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.559
Okay, can you answer
the telephone, maybe?

18:13.634 --> 18:16.558
Yeah, I could do that.
I used to work for a pimp back in the day.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.757
Yeah, I used to answer the phone and say,
"Pimps up, hos down, can I help you?"

18:19.807 --> 18:21.309
Yeah, I can do that.

18:21.392 --> 18:26.023
Okay, this is Easy Rest Retirement Home
where better living is an option.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.251
You want me to say all that when I answer
the phone? "Easy Rest Retirement Home"?

18:29.275 --> 18:30.961
- Where better living is an option.
- Where...

18:30.985 --> 18:33.579
- Option. Okay, great, I could say that.
- Okay.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.658
Now, there's a few things
that I need you to know that's...

18:36.741 --> 18:39.540
Are you okay?
You got so excited when the phone rang.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.308
"Easy Rest Retirement Home,
where better living is an option."

18:44.332 --> 18:45.754
You heard that?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.508
How the hell can I help you?

18:51.005 --> 18:52.348
Looking for somebody named Malik.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.804
Malik, that's my husband.
Is that Katanya calling here?

18:54.967 --> 18:57.220
Is this Katanya calling here?

18:57.303 --> 19:01.183
Yes, Malik, yes. She said...
You're the baby mama? It's the baby mama.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.243
Yes, I know that.
Please tell her, "Don't call here."

19:03.267 --> 19:05.986
She said she knows you're the baby...
Don't call...

19:06.062 --> 19:09.066
Girl, I can't tell her that, I just
met her. You go on cussing like that.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.324
She said
you won't let him come see his son.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.780
Yeah, and he's not coming back over there.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.375
Girl, I got to go, I'm a sinner.
You're makin' me blush.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.349
That's pretty good, though.
She just cussed you the hell out.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.876
- She is cussing me out?
- Yeah, she cussed you out.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.961
If words could kill, you'd be sliced up.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.970
- Wow, I'm sorry you had to hear that.
- No worries. Wonderful.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.552
Now, here's the files
for all the living patients.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.433
These are all the living. Okay, wonderful.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.365
And here are the files
for all the deceased patients.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.561
Hold the hell on.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.776
- This is the living?
- Yes, ma'am.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.278
- And this is the dead?
- Yes.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.456
- I gotta get the hell out of here.
- No, no!

19:58.614 --> 20:01.037
No, y'all killing people up in here, honey.
No.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.703
Ms. Mabel, these all need to be filed.

20:03.786 --> 20:07.290
You have nothing
to worry about, okay? Nothing.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.671
Now, when someone calls for Ms. Carla,

20:09.750 --> 20:11.844
you're gonna transfer them
to this extension.

20:11.919 --> 20:16.641
This extension, okay. When they call...
I understand.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.643
And then when someone calls,
you need to place them on hold,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.196
- just press the hold button.
- I know what that is.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.460
Watch this. I'm pressing pound.

20:32.606 --> 20:36.656
Ms. Mabel, first of all, someone has to be on
that phone for you to press that button...

20:36.944 --> 20:39.538
- No, I'm pressing the ho button.
- The what button?

20:39.613 --> 20:41.115
The ho button.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.118
But what is this?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.622
This is presenting.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.006
- Who are you presenting?
- The hos.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.174
- Well...
- Yeah, when I used to work for the pimp,

20:54.253 --> 20:57.107
you pressed this button and all the girls
come from the back and they line up.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.151
So, you press the ho button,
they all come, and you say,

20:59.175 --> 21:00.552
"Hello, can I help you?"

21:02.303 --> 21:06.900
Okay, well, now, when someone calls
for a deceased patient, it would be...

21:07.266 --> 21:10.328
This is a lot of instructions, honey. This
is a lot for me to do on the first day.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.231
- But you're gonna get it, I know you will.
- Okay, what I gotta do now?

21:13.314 --> 21:15.442
Now, when someone calls
for a deceased patient...

21:15.524 --> 21:17.294
- Does that mean somebody's dead?
- Dead, yes.

21:17.318 --> 21:20.697
Okay, say "dead," don't say "deceased."
That's too proper.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.748
Somebody say "dead." Say "dead."

21:22.823 --> 21:24.917
"Deceased," you know
what deceased means?

21:24.992 --> 21:26.665
That sounds harsh.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.888
- What, that they're dead?
- "They're dead."

21:27.912 --> 21:30.210
But they're dead, they can't hear you.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.925
"We are sorry to inform you that 'blank'
is deceased." Let me change it.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.598
"We are sorry to inform you
that 'blank' is dead."

21:39.673 --> 21:41.721
Well, Ms. Mabel... Okay...

21:42.176 --> 21:45.271
We're not gonna say a "blank,"
we're gonna put a name in that blank.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.898
Girl, when I see a blank,
I know to fill it.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.857
"We are sorry to inform you
that Dalia is dead

21:54.855 --> 21:56.823
"'cause she was working
on my blank nerves

21:56.899 --> 21:59.448
"as I sit here trying
to do this blank job."

22:00.402 --> 22:01.654
Well, you got it.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.897
- Good, you catch on quick, right?
- Yeah, you do, too.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.371
"Because my gun is not full of blanks."

22:09.578 --> 22:11.251
I got it, wonderful. What else?

22:12.706 --> 22:14.226
When someone comes to visit a patient,

22:14.291 --> 22:16.089
it would be great if you
could get their name

22:16.168 --> 22:19.297
- and who they're here to see. Yes.
- Yes, name here. I see that. Wonderful.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.892
Easy Rest Retirement...

22:28.430 --> 22:31.650
You ain't gonna sit here and stand over me
like I don't know what the hell to say

22:31.725 --> 22:35.650
when you told me five times
what to say on this phone.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.541
- Please, Ms. Mabel...
- You ain't gonna do that to me.

22:37.565 --> 22:40.239
- You ain't gonna do that to me!
- Ms. Mabel?

22:41.151 --> 22:42.903
Someone's on the phone.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.081
Who are you lookin' for? Barbara Nichols?

22:46.156 --> 22:47.829
She's in the upper room.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.785
- Okay, she is dead.
- No.

22:50.828 --> 22:51.829
Yes.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.889
- No, no...
- I'm sorry to inform you...

22:53.914 --> 22:55.131
No!

22:57.334 --> 22:58.711
What the hell's wrong with you?

22:59.420 --> 23:04.927
Ms. Mabel, she's not dead, she's alive.
She's here and she's upstairs.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.766
Why did you say she's in the upper room?

23:08.929 --> 23:11.366
- That's the proper way to say it.
- That's not the proper way to say it.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.189
Everybody who was in the upper room
is dead.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.316
The upper room was back in the Bible times

23:16.395 --> 23:19.990
when the 12 disciplines was up there
waiting for the Holy Ghost to come.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.534
Everybody who was in that room is dead.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.659
They have been sancted
and mortalized into church, okay?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.757
Learn the Bible or something.
Honey, pick up the Bible.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.501
You would know that that was
the Holy Ghost called Hurricane Katrina,

23:30.701 --> 23:33.501
that came through, took the roof
off the place, and shook up everybody.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.515
And then they were speaking
all these different tongues,

23:35.539 --> 23:38.268
ain't nobody could understand nothing
'cause they started talking Japanese.

23:38.292 --> 23:41.387
Read your Bible sometime.

23:41.462 --> 23:44.932
Now you got me upset this girl talking about
all that stuff, she's in the upper room.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.101
Just tell me she's in the upper room.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.479
Ma'am, are you there? Stop crying, please.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.023
Yes, funeral arrangements will be held...

23:56.644 --> 23:58.772
- Funeral arrangements?
- What is wrong with you'?

23:58.854 --> 24:00.481
She's not dead!

24:00.606 --> 24:03.280
Honey, when you tell a lie this bad,
you just gotta go with it.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.500
You can send flowers, thank you.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.003
- My goodness...
- But this is gonna be fine.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.681
I believe I can do this job.
This is gonna be all right.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.754
- My goodness, she thinks that...
- I got it.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.930
Eat the Bread Retirement Home,
this is the facility.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.007
May I help you?

24:27.091 --> 24:31.016
What did you say?
You're trying to reach Barbara Nichols?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.267
Yes, she is upstairs resting.

24:33.347 --> 24:36.897
She's takin' a nap 'cause everybody's tired
'cause we eat Jell-O and go to bed.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.135
Somebody told you she was dead?

24:41.188 --> 24:44.158
Now, who would play an awful joke
on you like that'? That is terrible.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.907
The devil is alive.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.874
I rebuke that in the name of Jesus.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.919
No, honey,
she is alive and well and doing very good.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.874
You can come visit her at any time.
Thank you. Goodbye.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.880
I bit my tongue.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.887
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.098
- That's good...
- Why do you say "dead"...

25:16.181 --> 25:17.933
- Hey, Dalia!
- Come back here, honey.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.036
What the hell,
you comin' up here like Mary Tyler Moore,

25:20.060 --> 25:22.188
throwing your hat up in the air!

25:25.065 --> 25:26.942
What the hell wrong with you?

25:27.026 --> 25:30.280
You ain't got no uniform on or nothing,
you ain't got no name tag,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.160
so, you're obviously a visitor, right?

25:32.239 --> 25:33.240
Yes.

25:33.907 --> 25:37.707
Okay, and I need your credit card number
and the last four digits of your social?

25:37.786 --> 25:38.787
Excuse me?

25:39.872 --> 25:41.670
Ms. Mabel, that's not on there.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.922
Girl, I was getting ready to
hit living small on you,

25:44.001 --> 25:46.550
I ain't lyin'.
I was gonna set you up real good.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.348
- Can I go?
- You can go on up. Here you go.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.719
Thank you.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.180
Who was that?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.779
That's Mrs. Watson's daughter,
the lady that was sitting right there.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.225
Okay.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.354
She comes and reads to her
every single day.

25:59.433 --> 26:00.650
- Every day!
- All the time?

26:00.726 --> 26:04.151
And she just got married
and she's back here again.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.909
How long does she stay
when she comes here?

26:05.939 --> 26:08.283
Five, six hours.
One day, eight, nine hours...

26:08.358 --> 26:10.907
That's a lot, honey.
That's a lot to be sitting around.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.035
<i>Madam.!</i>

26:14.615 --> 26:16.743
Lord Jesus!

26:16.909 --> 26:18.786
<i>We got them things
We shut 'em down</i>

26:18.869 --> 26:21.622
<i>We got them things
They know it's around</i>

26:23.832 --> 26:25.834
Hattie, look at you.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.964
Hattie, look at you, looking like...

26:31.465 --> 26:34.059
Madea, what are you doing here,
you came to see me?

26:34.134 --> 26:35.932
I ain't know you was up in this home.

26:36.178 --> 26:40.809
Yeah, my sister got mad at me
and put me in here about two years ago

26:40.891 --> 26:42.939
'cause I did one little old bitty thing.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.651
- What did you do, honey?
- I slept with her man.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.908
Hattie, at some point,
you gotta let it go, honey.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.327
At some point, you just gotta give it up.

26:52.528 --> 26:56.283
Well, that's what I did.
I gave it up and I let it go.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.461
Lord, that's nice, you got on!

27:00.536 --> 27:02.664
- You like my dress?
- That's nice.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.832
This is my Coco Chanel.

27:04.957 --> 27:05.958
That's nice.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.020
You can afford to wear that now?

27:19.096 --> 27:20.281
No, no, my next door neighbor,

27:20.305 --> 27:21.825
her name's Coco
and her daughter's name is Chanel.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.226
They sew and they make these.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.854
Yeah, they sell 'em over there
in the West End at Lee Street,

27:26.937 --> 27:28.289
right there at the corner of
the MARTA station,

27:28.313 --> 27:31.633
you can go over there and pick one up right
across the street from the Krispy Kreme.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.705
But don't go over there after night.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.036
Look at you, looking like you looking.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.750
You go away from here,
you always say the nicest things.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.376
I'm so glad you think so.

27:50.586 --> 27:54.432
'Cause sometime I look at your head, I don't
know if you have a mirror or a friend.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.181
'Cause one of them
would have told you the truth.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.560
Lord, you know, Madea,
sometimes I look at you,

28:02.639 --> 28:05.734
I don't know if you have a razor
or shaving cream.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.409
You cut that out,
you know I got hormone problems.

28:27.581 --> 28:30.334
I'm-a get you for that one.

28:33.086 --> 28:37.592
Dalia, I'm looking over this woman's
arrest record and I don't know about this.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.927
Carla, you have nothing to worry about.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.804
- She's already here...
- She's here?

28:42.179 --> 28:44.352
Yes, she's doing good.
She's training really well.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.271
Answering the telephones,
don't worry about it.

28:46.308 --> 28:47.525
- Hi, Ms. Mabel?
- Yeah?

28:47.601 --> 28:48.912
Just wanted you to meet Ms. Carla.

28:48.936 --> 28:52.281
Carla, you the one that sign the paper.
Go on, sign this paper for me, please.

28:52.773 --> 28:56.243
Just go on and sign your name down there.
Don't worry about what it is, just sign it.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.371
I'm afraid you have to actually do
the community service.

28:59.529 --> 29:02.032
You like that, huh? You a Christian, too?

29:02.491 --> 29:06.041
Well, no. But I don't want the universe
to send that bad energy back to me.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.120
The universe.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.005
I've been looking over
your arrest record here.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.382
Pretty impressive, right?

29:15.420 --> 29:17.593
First felony, nine years old.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.014
Well, I was doing the damn thing.

29:22.219 --> 29:25.723
Okay, well, I'm sure Dalia has already
instructed you.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.274
You can go ahead and get started.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.439
Thank you so much.
I would like to get started.

29:29.518 --> 29:30.815
Thank you so much.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.813
She's so nice. And bougie as hell.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.233
Yeah, she bougie, now. She bougie.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.235
I can't believe
I have a prisoner working for me.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.839
What you say about a prisoner, honey?

29:39.069 --> 29:41.214
Go on, speak up. Speak your mind.
What you say about a prisoner?

29:41.238 --> 29:46.826
I was just saying that I was surprised
to have a prisoner working here.

29:46.827 --> 29:49.472
See, that's what's wrong with people.
Y'all don't give folks the chance to

29:49.496 --> 29:51.975
give back to society after they've done
something wrong and went to jail.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.919
You need to give them a chance to get a job
and get back up on their feet.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.981
If you're sitting next to somebody
that's clapping right now,

29:58.005 --> 30:00.258
they've been to jail,
so watch your purse, please.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.341
Thank you.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.177
It's a public service announcement.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.565
Public service announcement.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.036
Dalia, I meant to tell you.

30:21.361 --> 30:24.490
I came by here last night
and this counter was a mess.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.076
Well, no, I know that counter
was clean last night.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.412
I think someone was up late eating.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.499
- Don't look at me.
- Hattie, you're still eating.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.553
Madea, you know I smoke that weed,
I get the munchies at night.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.306
Hattie, don't let it happen again, okay?

30:41.381 --> 30:43.943
Slow your roll, precious. Ain't none of
your little boyfriends in here.

30:43.967 --> 30:44.968
Hattie.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.905
Look, Hattie, just don't go back to
the counter after lights out, you got me?

30:47.929 --> 30:51.308
Look, Carla, I didn't go back to the
counter after lights out, you got me?

30:51.558 --> 30:52.901
Hattie, stop playing with me.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.021
You stop playing with me. And don't be
taking your frustrations out on me,

30:56.063 --> 30:58.737
'cause you've been messing around
with a married man for six years,

30:58.982 --> 31:01.906
he divorced his wife,
went and married somebody else,

31:01.985 --> 31:04.829
and still didn't even come back
and marry your stinky tail.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.751
Dalia, in my office, right now!

31:09.826 --> 31:12.722
Hattie, you wrong for that. You don't sit
there telling that girl's business

31:12.746 --> 31:14.599
and talking all loud like that
in front of everybody.

31:14.623 --> 31:18.253
You gotta wait until they close the door.
Now what happened, girl? Tell me!

31:19.252 --> 31:21.254
Are you telling my business?

31:21.630 --> 31:23.900
- No, no, I didn't say a word.
- Well, how did Hattie know that?

31:23.924 --> 31:25.267
Carla, I don't know.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.437
I don't like her. I don't like her,
I don't like this, I just...

31:28.637 --> 31:30.856
Carla, calm down now. You know me.

31:31.765 --> 31:33.767
You're right. Yes, I do know you.
I'm sorry.

31:33.934 --> 31:37.984
I have a date to get ready for. I'm not
even gonna think about what she just said.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.574
Easy Rest Retirement...

31:42.150 --> 31:44.699
Where all hell's breaking loose,
can I help you?

31:45.445 --> 31:46.742
Who you calling for?

31:47.697 --> 31:51.042
Jones, let's see. Last name Jones.

31:51.576 --> 31:55.171
I gotta do the remix on that.
She's not in that file, son, hold on.

31:55.789 --> 31:56.961
Who is this to you?

31:58.250 --> 32:00.673
It's your mother? Okay. I found her.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.804
Lord, hold on, I got to get some papers
telling me she's dead. Hold on.

32:09.803 --> 32:13.808
We are sorry to inform you
that Mrs. Jones died.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.568
It was a lovely day when she died.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.395
How do they know it was a lovely day...

32:19.354 --> 32:20.651
What the hell wrong with you?

32:20.730 --> 32:24.155
We reading the eulogy.
I was just weeping with her.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.331
- You doing what?
- I was weeping with her.

32:42.878 --> 32:45.347
Don't do that. Don't do that.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.020
Okay, are you there?

32:56.725 --> 32:58.648
Yes, yes.

32:59.019 --> 33:02.068
We are sorry to inform you that
Ms. Lee died.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.992
It was a lovely day, now I don't know how
the hell they know that,

33:06.067 --> 33:07.694
they say that to everybody.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.456
I'm supposed to say a prayer...

33:12.073 --> 33:14.246
What, how do they start?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.543
Our Father... That's it.
Which art in heaven,

33:18.788 --> 33:21.507
Hollywood be thy name.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.378
And then at the bottom,
I'm supposed to get deep and say...

33:25.170 --> 33:26.547
...come in a Hyundai, E. coli...

33:28.798 --> 33:31.426
What you say? How long ago she died?

33:33.720 --> 33:36.064
Son, this paper says
she died three years ago.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.360
You ain't called or checked on this woman
or been by here in three years?

33:40.435 --> 33:42.608
Please hold while I transfer you to hell.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.448
We had a breakthrough.

33:53.532 --> 33:54.829
So, what's going on, baby?

33:54.908 --> 33:56.706
Your baby mama keep calling here, Malik.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.038
- Calling here?
- Yes, calling here.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.418
Harassing me and driving me crazy.

34:01.915 --> 34:04.009
- What is she saying?
- She's cussing me out.

34:04.084 --> 34:07.509
Telling me how I'm not letting you be
a good father to your son.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.714
What did you say?

34:09.797 --> 34:11.596
What do you mean, "What did I say," Malik?

34:11.800 --> 34:16.021
Every single time you go over there,
it is nothing but drama with her.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.938
Baby, that is my son.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.690
This has nothing to do with your son.

34:19.766 --> 34:23.020
This has everything to do with
her interference in our relationship.

34:23.103 --> 34:25.572
And I am sick of this.
Lam sick of this, Malik.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.945
Listen, we can't let her come between us.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.031
If we do that, she's winning, baby.

34:30.110 --> 34:33.909
Malik, we need to figure out something.
And we need to figure out something now.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.286
Baby, I have to go see my son.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.664
When I married you, Malik,

34:38.743 --> 34:42.918
I didn't marry into all of this chaos
and all of this confusion.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.792
Look, I know, okay? Do you love me?

34:47.793 --> 34:53.516
<i>Do you know how happy
How happy you make me?</i>

34:53.800 --> 34:59.022
<i>And do you know how much
How much I love you truly?</i>

34:59.180 --> 35:05.529
<i>I can't live a day
A day without you</i>

35:05.770 --> 35:10.901
<i>I can't think about it
I just don't want to</i>

35:10.984 --> 35:17.208
<i>'Cause it's unbelievable love from on high</i>

35:17.282 --> 35:23.631
<i>And it's indescribable joy
Just me and mine</i>

35:23.705 --> 35:29.508
<i>See, what we have
It works for us</i>

35:29.586 --> 35:32.590
<i>And we thank God</i>

35:32.672 --> 35:37.849
<i>That we have true love</i>

35:40.805 --> 35:43.775
<i>Oh, baby</i>

35:47.604 --> 35:53.111
<i>You're my man, my best friend</i>

35:53.193 --> 35:58.370
<i>I'm always here
Through thick and thin</i>

35:58.448 --> 36:05.127
<i>On your side night or day</i>

36:05.205 --> 36:10.837
<i>And I'm your girl, come what may</i>

36:10.919 --> 36:16.722
<i>'Cause it's unbelievable love
From on high</i>

36:16.800 --> 36:22.898
<i>And it's indescribable joy
Just me and mine</i>

36:23.264 --> 36:28.942
<i>What we have It works for us</i>

36:29.020 --> 36:31.990
<i>And we thank God</i>

36:32.065 --> 36:35.239
<i>That we have true</i>

36:35.318 --> 36:40.666
<i>Unbelievable love From on high</i>

36:40.740 --> 36:46.838
<i>And it's indescribable joy
Just me and mine</i>

36:46.913 --> 36:52.545
<i>What we have It works for us</i>

36:52.627 --> 36:55.881
<i>And we thank God</i>

36:55.964 --> 36:59.013
<i>That we have true</i>

36:59.092 --> 37:01.470
<i>Unbelievable love</i>

37:05.765 --> 37:10.362
I love you so much, baby.
Just be patient, okay?

37:20.363 --> 37:24.209
That's all I'm gonna tell you, son, if you like
the girl, you need to go and tell her that.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.878
You know, I tried to tell her, but...

37:26.995 --> 37:28.622
Good God Almighty.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.767
She doesn't give me an opportunity.
She just tells me to leave her alone.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.227
Son, pick that up for me.
I just dropped that.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.549
All right, sure.
Let me get that for you, ma'am.

37:35.628 --> 37:36.800
Jesus!

37:39.090 --> 37:40.091
All right.

37:40.175 --> 37:41.927
You know what's missing from your hair?

37:42.010 --> 37:43.808
Hey, hey! What's that?

37:44.137 --> 37:45.684
A strap, to go around your chin.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.084
Look like you have a helmet on, son.
What the hell is that?

37:48.308 --> 37:50.035
- A helmet?
- You need to cut your hair, son.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.151
Cut my hair?

37:51.227 --> 37:53.038
Yes. That's why that woman
can't pay attention to you,

37:53.062 --> 37:54.902
'cause you got a hole in
the top of your afro.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.819
It look like you've got a black
Christmas wreath around your head, son.

38:00.236 --> 38:04.332
Or a bereavement wreath. All you need is "Rest
in peace" carved across the front of it.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.661
Son, you're losing your hair.
You've got to let it go.

38:08.036 --> 38:11.256
I get it. That's your beard.

38:11.706 --> 38:15.301
You're letting it grow, combed it all
up to the top, that's the deal?

38:16.336 --> 38:19.966
No, ma'am, it's actually right
in this area, right here.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.767
Son, that's your sideburns
that you let grow all the way up there.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.264
You bald at the top, son.

38:24.719 --> 38:27.347
You got to let it go.
You got to let it go, you understand?

38:27.430 --> 38:28.602
Let it go?

38:28.681 --> 38:30.493
It's coming back, if you
look at it real close.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.485
The devil is a liar, it ain't coming back.

38:33.645 --> 38:37.775
Son, that woman won't look at you
'cause you coming at her the wrong way.

38:37.857 --> 38:41.003
You need to go get you a nice suit, cut
your hair. You ain't got no kids, do you?

38:41.027 --> 38:44.247
- No, ma'am, no children.
- I know. Them glasses are birth control.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.761
Every time a woman see them glasses,
they go the other direction.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.332
Do you understand what I'm saying?

38:50.870 --> 38:52.515
Son, if you want that woman,
then do what I say.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.042
That ain't the kind of woman
you come walking up to

38:55.124 --> 38:58.004
looking like the way you look.
You need a nice suit on, not your uniform.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.214
Get a nice suit on, cut your hair.
Let it go.

39:01.214 --> 39:02.511
Let it go?

39:02.590 --> 39:04.012
Cut your hair, son. It's all right.

39:04.092 --> 39:07.092
You look like you stuck in the '70s.
I don't know if I wanna say Soul Train.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.016
I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna say to you.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.606
- How you doing?
- Hi.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.564
You don't see him standing there?

39:18.481 --> 39:20.358
See, she didn't even look at you.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.745
That's why I'm telling you.
Cut your hair, son. It's all right.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.332
I just want a woman that accepts me for me.

39:26.406 --> 39:29.343
You ain't accepting you for you. The
Lord has already told you, you are bald,

39:29.367 --> 39:31.687
and you're trying to hold on to something
that ain't there.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.891
I'm telling you, cut your hair, put on
some nice clothes, you'll be all right.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.759
But you're gonna hear me all day saying,
"Cut your hair."

39:39.252 --> 39:40.253
Cut your hair.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.472
Cut my hair?

39:43.548 --> 39:45.425
Took me a long time to grow this.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.728
How you doing, Ms. Carla?

39:49.470 --> 39:51.063
Hey, what you doing here so late?

39:51.347 --> 39:53.190
I had a date cancel on me.

39:53.766 --> 39:54.767
You had a date.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.154
Just gonna let another man take you out?

39:58.313 --> 39:59.860
Yeah, you men.

40:00.273 --> 40:01.750
"You men," what's that supposed to mean?

40:01.774 --> 40:03.697
It means
you're always just about yourselves.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.912
That's not true, Ms. Carla.
All men are not the same.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.865
The ones I run into are.

40:08.990 --> 40:12.303
Well, that sounds like a personal problem.
Maybe you're just choosing the wrong man.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.376
All right, that's your cue.
Get out of my office, Allen.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.467
Wait, wait, why are you here so late?

40:20.251 --> 40:22.128
Well, I just came by to check on everybody.

40:22.754 --> 40:23.971
No, no.

40:24.631 --> 40:27.976
No man your age is trying to be here
volunteering unless he wants something.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.135
Now, Ms. Carla...

40:29.218 --> 40:31.721
Now, I mean, you being here during the day,
I get that.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.449
I figure you're trying to get close to me.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.020
Amen...

40:35.600 --> 40:39.150
But you being here late at night like this
is just creepy and I don't like it.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.481
Now, why are you here?

40:42.649 --> 40:43.696
All right, look...

40:44.692 --> 40:46.786
Couple years ago, my mother passed away.

40:47.612 --> 40:48.829
And I miss her.

40:49.489 --> 40:52.743
So I come here and I sit with these folks
and I listen to them.

40:52.825 --> 40:55.669
And I learn and it just reminds me of her.

40:55.995 --> 40:56.995
I'm really sorry, Allen.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.308
- I didn't know that. Forgive me.
- No, no. No apology needed.

40:59.332 --> 41:02.061
I've answered the question for you,
will you please answer a question for me?

41:02.085 --> 41:03.132
Yeah, fine.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.179
Why you keep going out
with these no-account men

41:05.254 --> 41:06.440
and all they do is break your heart?

41:06.464 --> 41:07.566
That's none of your business.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.718
M mama wasn't none of our business.
<i>Y Y</i>

41:14.847 --> 41:17.851
This is not quite where I thought I
would be at this time of my life.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.584
Yeah? Where did you think you'd be
at this time of your life?

41:21.020 --> 41:23.694
Married. Kids.

41:25.108 --> 41:28.362
Except the man
I thought would marry me, didn't.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.702
You talking about the doctor
that was married.

41:31.864 --> 41:32.944
How do you know about that?

41:32.991 --> 41:35.244
Small facility. Small facility.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.953
Ms. Carla, I didn't mean no harm.

41:37.036 --> 41:39.004
I didn't mean no harm.
I just want to talk to you.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.923
Just talk a bit. Just talk.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.714
All right, yes, he was married.

41:44.252 --> 41:47.176
He said he was gonna leave his wife
and he did, except...

41:47.714 --> 41:48.966
Well, when he did,

41:50.633 --> 41:52.055
he went to another woman.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.012
Wow.

41:54.137 --> 41:56.515
Now, you know, Ms. Carla,
you deserve much better than that.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.688
Well, that's what I keep getting.

41:59.392 --> 42:02.111
I don't know, somehow
I always seem to run into the wrong men.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.655
Well, that's because you won't run to me.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.733
I don't know you, Allen.

42:06.816 --> 42:09.837
It ain't like I haven't been trying to get
to know you for the past year and a half.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.613
Yeah, right. Why?

42:11.738 --> 42:13.206
'Cause I see your heart.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.330
I like the way you carry yourself,
the way you dress,

42:16.409 --> 42:18.929
- the way you wear your hair.
- All right, that's enough. That is enough.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.126
I can't do another line
from another lying man.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.642
No, no, I'm speaking from the heart,
Ms. Carla. It's not a line.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.088
Allen, just...

42:27.837 --> 42:30.590
Just please, leave me alone, okay? Please!

42:32.592 --> 42:33.593
Yes, ma'am.

42:36.846 --> 42:37.847
Ms. Carla...

42:39.640 --> 42:41.267
All men are not the same.

42:42.310 --> 42:43.732
We're not all the same.

42:43.811 --> 42:44.812
Right.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.107
All men are not the same.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.243
All men are not the same.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.909
Then what's wrong with me?

42:55.198 --> 42:58.293
'Cause it has to be me, right?
That's what...

42:59.827 --> 43:01.670
That's what you're saying, right?

43:06.292 --> 43:07.464
I don't know.

43:09.796 --> 43:14.393
<i>All I want is love</i>

43:14.967 --> 43:19.564
<i>Is that too much to ask?</i>

43:19.889 --> 43:24.315
<i>All I want is to be held</i>

43:24.393 --> 43:28.990
<i>And not have to beg
Not have to ask</i>

43:29.315 --> 43:31.864
<i>All I want is love</i>

43:31.943 --> 43:36.494
<i>No matter which way it comes to me</i>

43:37.532 --> 43:41.127
<i>I just want to be held</i>

43:41.202 --> 43:45.002
<i>Through life's stormy seas</i>

43:45.081 --> 43:49.803
<i>All I want is love</i>

43:50.795 --> 43:54.720
<i>Loneliness, please go away</i>

43:54.799 --> 43:59.600
<i>Al! I need is love</i>

43:59.679 --> 44:03.980
<i>Is that too much to ask for?</i>

44:05.560 --> 44:08.313
<i>Every day</i>

44:15.820 --> 44:19.996
<i>Why is it so hard</i>

44:21.242 --> 44:25.497
<i>For a woman to find love?</i>

44:25.580 --> 44:30.006
<i>I just want someone to be mine</i>

44:30.084 --> 44:34.430
<i>Sent from God above</i>

44:34.505 --> 44:38.430
<i>I don't want to be judged</i>

44:38.509 --> 44:42.810
<i>No, that's not me</i>

44:42.889 --> 44:47.235
<i>I just don't want to be lonely</i>

44:47.310 --> 44:50.610
<i>Don't want this agony</i>

44:50.688 --> 44:56.536
<i>All I want is love</i>

44:56.611 --> 45:00.616
<i>Loneliness, please go away</i>

45:00.698 --> 45:05.249
<i>Al! I need is love</i>

45:05.328 --> 45:11.085
<i>Is that too much to ask?</i>

45:11.209 --> 45:15.635
<i>Lonely, lonely</i>

45:15.713 --> 45:18.933
<i>Yes, that is me</i>

45:19.008 --> 45:22.638
<i>Looking at all these people</i>

45:22.720 --> 45:26.725
<i>I don't want that to be me</i>

45:26.807 --> 45:31.859
<i>Old and alone</i>

45:31.938 --> 45:36.660
<i>All by myself</i>

45:36.734 --> 45:40.079
<i>Living in this agony</i>

45:41.239 --> 45:44.709
<i>Loving no one else</i>

45:44.784 --> 45:50.962
<i>Al! I want</i>

45:52.959 --> 45:58.591
<i>Loneliness, please go away</i>

45:59.215 --> 46:01.718
<i>Is that too much to ask?</i>

46:01.801 --> 46:05.726
<i>All I want is love</i>

46:05.805 --> 46:08.274
<i>Somebody for me</i>

46:09.809 --> 46:12.562
<i>Love, to know what I need</i>

46:12.645 --> 46:14.147
<i>Love</i>

46:14.230 --> 46:17.530
<i>I want it, I need it I want</i>

46:17.608 --> 46:20.077
<i>I deserve it</i>

46:20.152 --> 46:22.280
<i>Love</i>

46:22.405 --> 46:26.660
<i>Love</i>

46:30.538 --> 46:35.669
<i>All I want is</i>

46:36.002 --> 46:41.725
<i>Love</i>

46:49.849 --> 46:51.897
I got married, Mama.

46:52.476 --> 46:56.322
Look, I brought pictures.
I brought pictures and everything.

46:58.316 --> 47:02.037
Mama, please talk to me.
Please say something.

47:03.279 --> 47:04.576
Sam.

47:04.864 --> 47:07.538
Why do you keep sending all these letters
to the hospital?

47:07.616 --> 47:09.216
Look, I got a job and I want to keep it.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.876
Sorry, I just wanted to see you.

47:13.205 --> 47:16.049
Why? You never wanted to see me
when I was a kid.

47:16.125 --> 47:17.445
So, why you trying to see me now?

47:17.543 --> 47:20.012
Look, son, I was young, I was foolish.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.840
Man, stop sending letters to the hospital.
You got me?

47:23.716 --> 47:25.059
Yeah, okay.

47:25.134 --> 47:27.603
Look, son, wait.
Why don't you stay for a little while?

47:27.678 --> 47:28.770
Why?

47:28.846 --> 47:30.564
- Well, how you been?
- Fine.

47:30.890 --> 47:32.576
I read on the Internet
that you got married.

47:32.600 --> 47:33.897
Yeah.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.312
You have any kids yet?

47:36.562 --> 47:37.859
I have a son.

47:39.065 --> 47:40.362
Look, I gotta go.

47:40.441 --> 47:41.567
Look, son,

47:41.650 --> 47:44.770
I know I haven't been that good of a father
to you, but I just wanted you to...

47:45.112 --> 47:46.705
What? What?

47:47.740 --> 47:49.287
That you're sorry?

47:49.367 --> 47:51.461
I already know how sorry you are.

47:52.203 --> 47:54.797
Look, my mother died in my arms.

47:54.872 --> 47:58.092
And you didn't even have the decency
to come to the hospital to see her.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.590
You were too busy with your wife and kids.

48:00.795 --> 48:04.015
And now they all drug
addicts and in prison,

48:04.090 --> 48:06.513
so you wanna reach out
to the one that made it.

48:07.343 --> 48:09.596
Well, I don't have a thing to say to you.

48:10.096 --> 48:11.473
At all. Nothing.

48:11.847 --> 48:13.849
Sam, I just wanted you to know
that I love you.

48:14.225 --> 48:15.317
That I'm sorry.

48:15.393 --> 48:18.772
Look, don't write or call me again,
you got me?

48:19.605 --> 48:21.733
Sam, I'm sorry.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.743
Sand!

48:28.197 --> 48:31.292
Mama. Mama. Hey, Mama.

48:31.367 --> 48:32.744
Rebecca.

48:34.370 --> 48:35.917
How are you, Rebecca?

48:36.789 --> 48:39.588
I'm good. I'm good.
Now come on, I'm getting you out of here.

48:39.667 --> 48:41.135
No, I'm gonna stay here.

48:41.794 --> 48:43.046
It's for the best.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.223
So, Jennifer is still your favorite.

48:46.298 --> 48:48.058
It ain't got nothing to
do with my favorite.

48:48.592 --> 48:49.935
Where will we live?

48:50.386 --> 48:52.138
Mama, I have an apartment now.

48:52.388 --> 48:53.731
You still with that boy?

48:54.306 --> 48:56.058
Look, I got my life together.

48:56.350 --> 48:57.977
You still with that boy.

48:58.144 --> 49:00.317
Baby, I can't live with you.
That man is a drug dealer.

49:00.563 --> 49:01.564
Mama, not anymore.

49:01.647 --> 49:03.945
He had you out there
selling your body for dope!

49:04.024 --> 49:07.369
What I'd look like,
moving in with the two of you? A fool!

49:07.862 --> 49:10.581
Mama, look, we are both clean now, okay?

49:10.906 --> 49:13.910
We both went through rehab
and everything is better.

49:14.410 --> 49:16.663
You would know that
if you took my phone calls.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.189
Baby, I did all I could for you...

49:18.539 --> 49:20.058
And now, I'm trying to do
something for you.

49:20.082 --> 49:23.177
I'm sorry! You mortgaged my house!

49:23.461 --> 49:25.461
That your father and I worked
all of our lives for.

49:25.838 --> 49:27.590
And now I don't have nothing.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.596
Your sister had to come in and pay it off.

49:29.717 --> 49:32.095
And because that evil husband of hers
don't like me,

49:32.261 --> 49:34.559
he had to move me in here. Get out!

49:35.639 --> 49:37.391
Mama, I didn't mortgage your house.

49:37.516 --> 49:39.314
Baby, you still a liar.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.313
You wanna convince me you're clean?
Then, tell the truth.

49:42.605 --> 49:44.073
Tell me that you mortgaged my house.

49:44.148 --> 49:46.492
- Mama, I didn't.
- Tell me you spent my money on dope.

49:46.817 --> 49:48.364
- Mama, I didn't.
- Get out!

49:49.195 --> 49:51.948
And don't come back,
until you can tell the truth.

49:55.701 --> 49:57.123
Fine, Mama.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.373
Fine. I did not.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.426
Oh, God.

50:08.380 --> 50:12.476
<i>I raised my kids</i>

50:13.427 --> 50:19.275
<i>The best that I could</i>

50:22.645 --> 50:26.115
<i>Tried to do right</i>

50:27.233 --> 50:33.707
<i>Didn't always do good</i>

50:34.907 --> 50:41.791
<i>But is that a reason</i>

50:42.873 --> 50:49.597
<i>To leave me here?</i>

50:51.298 --> 50:57.772
<i>Just walk away</i>

50:58.847 --> 51:05.571
<i>Leaving me in tears?</i>

51:06.397 --> 51:11.574
<i>I know</i>

51:11.652 --> 51:15.532
<i>I wasn't</i>

51:15.614 --> 51:19.460
<i>The best father to him</i>

51:22.621 --> 51:29.300
<i>Even though I could have tried</i>

51:31.880 --> 51:36.556
<i>But is that a reason</i>

51:36.635 --> 51:40.685
<i>To leave me here?</i>

51:42.308 --> 51:46.859
<i>Just walk away</i>

51:46.937 --> 51:52.159
<i>Leaving me here in tears?</i>

51:52.526 --> 51:58.078
<i>They just left me</i>

51:58.157 --> 52:04.085
<i>Left me alone here to cry</i>

52:04.163 --> 52:09.465
<i>My heart broken, broken</i>

52:09.710 --> 52:13.465
<i>My soul is so tired</i>

52:13.547 --> 52:19.395
<i>They just left me, left me</i>

52:19.470 --> 52:22.599
<i>Alone here to cry</i>

52:22.723 --> 52:28.401
<i>My heart broken, broken</i>

52:28.479 --> 52:32.484
<i>My soul is so tired</i>

52:32.566 --> 52:36.491
<i>- They just left me
- They left me</i>

52:38.197 --> 52:41.792
<i>Alone here to cry</i>

52:41.867 --> 52:43.995
<i>They just left me</i>

52:44.078 --> 52:47.958
<i>My heart so broken, so broken</i>

52:48.040 --> 52:51.214
<i>And my soul is so tired</i>

52:51.293 --> 52:54.012
<i>They just left me</i>

52:54.129 --> 52:57.178
<i>They left me to die alone</i>

52:57.257 --> 53:00.807
<i>I need to be loved</i>

53:00.886 --> 53:03.639
<i>They left me, yes</i>

53:04.181 --> 53:07.776
<i>They left me They left me</i>

53:09.019 --> 53:10.521
<i>They left me</i>

53:10.604 --> 53:14.825
<i>They left me They left me</i>

53:14.900 --> 53:17.153
<i>They left me They left me</i>

53:19.154 --> 53:24.911
<i>They just left me</i>

53:39.466 --> 53:42.811
I thought I heard somebody down here.
What's your name?

53:43.095 --> 53:44.142
- Lee.
- Lee!

53:44.221 --> 53:45.689
Leave me alone.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.521
Well, I'm just trying to be nice.

53:48.767 --> 53:49.984
Well, don't be.

53:50.352 --> 53:54.698
Well, this is a small facility.
Lots of people have died here.

53:54.773 --> 53:57.071
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

53:57.317 --> 53:58.990
Is that supposed to make me feel good?

53:59.278 --> 54:01.246
Well, I'm just trying to make small talk
with you.

54:02.114 --> 54:05.163
Let me try to figure out
how to tell you this.

54:06.785 --> 54:08.913
I don't want to talk to you at all.

54:09.621 --> 54:10.918
Fine.

54:11.540 --> 54:13.042
You been crying?

54:13.125 --> 54:14.547
What's it to you?

54:15.127 --> 54:17.721
Well, I know what it feels like
to be left here to die.

54:18.297 --> 54:20.024
Your children don't come
and visit you anymore

54:20.048 --> 54:21.928
and you feel like
you're at the end of the road.

54:21.967 --> 54:25.141
There you go,
trying to make me feel good again.

54:26.305 --> 54:29.149
Look, I'm sorry. Here.

54:29.558 --> 54:30.730
What's this?

54:31.935 --> 54:33.312
Dry your eyes.

54:33.395 --> 54:34.988
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:35.647 --> 54:37.649
It's best sometimes to just accept it.

54:37.733 --> 54:38.950
I don't want to accept it.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.159
This is not how
my life was supposed to turn out.

54:42.905 --> 54:46.375
I wanted to die in a house
my husband and I lived in for 57 years.

54:47.743 --> 54:50.667
This is not where I was supposed to end up.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.920
I used to think the same things.

54:54.583 --> 54:56.176
It's so unfair.

54:57.085 --> 54:58.803
You work hard all your life

54:59.797 --> 55:02.346
and your children come in
and leave you here.

55:03.509 --> 55:06.353
I don't even make enough
in social security to live on my own.

55:07.221 --> 55:09.064
It's just wrong.

55:11.099 --> 55:12.316
It's going to be all right.

55:12.518 --> 55:14.771
I don't feel like I am.

55:16.230 --> 55:20.280
God, you got to get me through this.

55:20.818 --> 55:22.741
It's going to be all right.

55:22.820 --> 55:25.039
- Don't worry about it. It'll be fine.
- I don't know.

55:25.113 --> 55:26.160
I'm trying.

55:27.282 --> 55:28.579
I'm trying.

55:41.046 --> 55:42.468
Carson!

55:42.923 --> 55:44.220
What you doing with this woman?

55:44.424 --> 55:47.018
You gonna make me kill you yet.
I'm gonna drop you right here!

55:47.219 --> 55:50.439
I was just trying to calm her down.
Now, you calm down. She was upset.

55:50.764 --> 55:53.062
Well, she won't be upset if I kill her,
now, will she?

55:53.141 --> 55:55.394
Touch my man again. Touch him again...

55:55.477 --> 55:56.899
Woman, I ain't dating you!

55:57.145 --> 55:59.364
Now sit your behind down somewhere.

56:00.941 --> 56:04.571
All you gotta do is tell me one time,
you know I do what you say.

56:07.239 --> 56:09.708
Not on me, Hattie. Over there.

56:12.411 --> 56:15.164
Why you acting all funny
and everything, Carson?

56:15.247 --> 56:18.046
Nobody acting funny. Sit your behind down.

56:20.002 --> 56:21.879
What wrong with her, anyhow?

56:21.962 --> 56:26.308
The same thing that was wrong with you when
your sister dropped you off up in here.

56:26.425 --> 56:28.268
You remember how you felt?

56:28.969 --> 56:30.642
Now, say something nice to her.

56:33.473 --> 56:34.645
Something nice.

56:36.852 --> 56:37.853
Hattie?

56:38.937 --> 56:43.238
I'm sorry, I just get all discombobulated
when I see you with other women.

56:43.567 --> 56:46.116
Hattie, I ain't your man.

56:46.445 --> 56:48.413
You is my man!

56:49.615 --> 56:50.867
I don't want him.

56:53.035 --> 56:55.709
Well, good then,
we can have a conversation then.

56:57.497 --> 56:58.919
You don't know the story?

57:00.542 --> 57:02.544
It was a cold and rainy night,

57:04.630 --> 57:07.179
the winds was blowing with a vengeance.

57:07.966 --> 57:11.470
- The owls was howling as if to let the...
- Hattie!

57:12.512 --> 57:14.310
Owls don't howl,

57:14.640 --> 57:17.189
they hoot. Now get to the point.

57:18.310 --> 57:19.482
Yeah. He right.

57:20.812 --> 57:22.439
I'm gonna have to remember that.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.613
Owls don't howl, they hoot.

57:34.326 --> 57:38.126
It was two years ago, last week.

57:42.250 --> 57:45.254
My sister brought me here,
she just dropped me off.

57:48.423 --> 57:51.176
She dropped me off like I was nobody.

57:53.011 --> 57:54.684
At first I thought it was a joke,

57:54.846 --> 57:58.521
so I sat at that door
and I waited and I waited.

58:02.187 --> 58:04.360
And I've been waiting ever since.

58:06.024 --> 58:09.699
It ain't something you get used to,
you just learn to deal with it.

58:12.614 --> 58:14.992
I had to ask God to help me.

58:15.909 --> 58:20.756
And he doing it every day,
teaching me how to pray.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.879
<i>It seemed like yesterday</i>

58:28.630 --> 58:32.100
<i>I was in my prime</i>

58:32.968 --> 58:36.222
<i>Before I knew it, I was old</i>

58:36.805 --> 58:39.934
<i>I'm staring at the end of my time</i>

58:40.851 --> 58:43.900
<i>Where did the time go?</i>

58:44.604 --> 58:47.733
<i>Where did my youth go, too?</i>

58:48.358 --> 58:50.781
<i>How did I get here?</i>

58:51.403 --> 58:53.906
<i>Looking at it, I'm almost through</i>

58:53.989 --> 58:58.540
<i>Oh, life is but a moment</i>

58:58.618 --> 59:01.337
<i>You come and go, come and go
You come and</i>

59:01.413 --> 59:03.086
<i>Go like the wind</i>

59:03.498 --> 59:06.172
<i>We all have an appointed time</i>

59:07.127 --> 59:10.757
<i>Till we meet the end</i>

59:10.839 --> 59:13.638
<i>You better make the most of it</i>

59:14.259 --> 59:17.729
<i>Live your best life every day</i>

59:18.055 --> 59:21.559
<i>Got to live for God, got
to share your heart</i>

59:21.767 --> 59:25.146
<i>Say what you need to say</i>

59:25.771 --> 59:28.775
<i>Now yesterday I was young</i>

59:29.441 --> 59:32.991
<i>But now I'm old so fast</i>

59:33.570 --> 59:36.540
<i>Raised my children the best I could</i>

59:36.823 --> 59:40.373
<i>Now, now, now, I've realized</i>

59:40.786 --> 59:45.633
<i>This is not how I thought my life would be</i>

59:47.042 --> 59:48.544
<i>Now I'm in a home</i>

59:48.835 --> 59:52.135
<i>Alone with no one</i>

59:52.964 --> 59:57.811
<i>- No one, yeah
- Life is but a moment</i>

59:57.886 --> 01:00:00.685
<i>We come and go like the wind</i>

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.854
<i>We all have an appointed time</i>

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:09.407
<i>- We all, we all have an appointed time
- Till we meet our end</i>

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:12.280
<i>- You better make the most of it
- You better make the most of it</i>

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:15.989
<i>- Live your best life every day
- Best life every day</i>

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:17.994
<i>Got to live for God</i>

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.916
<i>- Got to share your heart
- Share it</i>

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:21.427
<i>- Share your heart
- Say what you need to say</i>

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.499
<i>Say it</i>

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.049
<i>Say it, say it, say it, say it</i>

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.920
<i>Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it</i>

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:37.476
<i>Say what you need to say</i>

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:41.431
<i>Say</i>

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.238
I appreciate you trying to
make me feel better.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.781
I guess it don't hurt to be nice
every now and then.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:00.574
Yes.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.709
I know it's gonna be all right.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:04.794
You're a nice lady.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:10.543
You need somebody to talk to?
I'll talk to you sometime.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.253
- Why, thank you.
- Look at you trying to be nice to somebody.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.963
Hattie, that's good, that's good.

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.357
- Good morning, good morning.
- Hattie.

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:17.849
You know I'm proud of you.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:20.393
- Thank you, honey.
- Go on, now. Go on, Hattie.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.531
Don't be man-handling her like that,
what the hell is wrong with you?

01:01:23.555 --> 01:01:26.399
No, let him push me again.
I got something for him.

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:31.071
I love you, but I'll kill him right here
and send him on to glory.

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.279
I know you.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:37.361
But she, she a really nice lady.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.546
I told you that yesterday.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.590
That's why you have to get to
know people before you cut them.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:41.991
Yeah.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.719
After you cut them,
they don't want to talk to you no more.

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:46.554
But before you cut them,
you need to get to know them.

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:47.579
Yeah.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:52.467
If she acts right, I might let her share
a box of my Fruity Pops.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:56.230
No, don't share that with her, 'cause
you get people addicted to that stuff.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:58.494
That's just like crack to you,
don't share that with her.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.475
Well, it don't treat
everybody the same way.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:03.812
That's just like crack,
it don't treat everybody the same way.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.976
You got to act right, though.
You want a bowl, you got to act right.

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:16.362
There's really some nice people
in the world today.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:23.156
Hattie, what's wrong with you?

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.416
Last time I checked,
I had 5,300 Fruity Pops in this box!

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.963
I ain't messing with you
with that darn cereal.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.212
God, somebody got to die.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:40.053
- What you going to do about it?
- Girl, you trying to get killed?

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:45.725
I'm just going to walk it out!
I'm just going to walk it out!

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:47.889
I'm just going to walk it out!

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:53.278
Now I lay me down to sleep,
pray the Lord my soul to keep,

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:54.622
and should she die before she wake,

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:57.149
I'm going to wake the heifer up
and kill her again.

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:02.574
Easy Rest Retirement,

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:05.703
where people are dying to get the hell
out of here, can I help you?

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:09.628
Boy, listen to me, let me ask you a
question. Did you get your hair cut?

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:12.088
You put on a nice suit? Well, come on.

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:14.090
Yeah, she's here. I see her in there.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:16.185
There's supposed to be a wall there,
but I can see her.

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:17.210
Yeah.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:22.007
Yeah. So, come on, come on. Bye.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.596
That boy's crazy about that girl.

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:28.990
What you doing standing at that door?

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:30.766
My daughter said she was coming by.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.249
Your daughter? The one that was by here
yesterday that I saw?

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:34.352
No.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.734
I'm talking about my
other daughter, Jennifer.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.857
My favorite daughter.

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:40.358
Your favorite?

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.286
Honey, you can't have no favorites
with your children.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.989
'Cause the very one
you put all your faith and hope in

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:48.871
will be the one to hurt you
and let you down the most.

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:51.453
I'm telling you now.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.705
Well, I love all my children equally,

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:55.215
but that Rebecca,

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:58.134
she's been out there in the streets
doing some of everything.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.011
And she fell out of favor with you?

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.638
Glad you ain't God.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.597
Honey, children are individuals.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.279
See, that's where parents
make their mistake.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.739
They think, just 'cause
they give their child

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:11.891
the exact same thing,
the exact same amount of love,

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.985
the exact same everything,
they're gonna turn out the exact same way.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:18.905
Children are individuals,
they have their own individual experiences,

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.824
you are not their only influences
on this earth, do you understand?

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:24.657
That's why you have to find out which is
the best way

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:26.704
to get the best results out of your child.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.241
Per child, it's a different result,
do you understand?

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:32.251
Each child needs their own different
result, do you understand?

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:33.416
Yeah.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:36.006
Let me break it down for you,
if you don't understand.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:39.352
One of your children, you may have to say,
"You know what, just sit there, don't move."

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.925
And that child will just sit
there all day long and not move.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.230
The other child you got to say,

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:44.482
"if you move, I'm gonna break your neck,

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:47.510
"your knuckles, your fingers, your throat,
and choke you half to death."

01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:48.593
Yup.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:51.096
- But the child don't move.
- That's right.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:53.064
So both children didn't move.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.141
You got the results
you wanted from both of them.

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:58.110
But you had to go about it in different
directions, you understand?

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:00.779
That's all I'm saying.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.100
Children are individuals, that's why you
have to be careful who you sleep with.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.699
Been and had a baby with somebody,
you ain't met their whole family

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:12.593
and your child is crazy as hell like
that cousin they've been trying to hide.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:13.618
Yup.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:18.460
A lot of parents love their children,
but they don't like them.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:21.744
That's all right,
I didn't even know that was possible

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:23.993
that you could love your child
and not like them at all.

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:27.466
Somebody back there clapping right now.
Stop all that clapping.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.933
Stop all that clapping.

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:31.261
If you sitting with that child right now,

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:34.268
you better look straight ahead,
close your eyes, just look straight ahead.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:38.119
- You hear what I'm telling you?
- You're right.

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:40.066
I know I'm right. You can't blanket-parent

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:43.225
and think that both children are gonna
turn out the same. They're individuals.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.531
It's like bringing
strangers into your house.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.410
Honey, what you doing in here?

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:51.365
Well, my daughter Jennifer got married
and her husband didn't like me.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.174
That didn't answer my question, though.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:55.494
They kept my house.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:57.371
Who kept your house?

01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:59.206
Jennifer and her husband.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:03.727
Honey, you got to explain this to me,
'cause I'm getting more and more confused.

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:04.752
I know.

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:06.713
See, my other daughter,

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.517
that's on drugs, mortgaged my house.
And Jennifer the good daughter paid it off.

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:11.593
Okay.

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:13.853
And then they didn't have no room for me.

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:15.681
And they moved me here.

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:24.823
Okay, let me see if I understand this.

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:27.168
- So, you got a daughter that's on crack.
- Yes.

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:29.536
That mortgaged your house
and you didn't know it.

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:31.380
And then you tell
your other daughter Jennifer

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:32.844
and she come up and she pays it off.

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:36.452
But then she don't have no room for you
in your house.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.212
And she moved you out of your house.

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:42.666
And that's the good one?

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.509
Child, I'd take my chances
with the crackhead.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.344
I don't know what the hell... No, child.

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:56.113
What's the address?
We need to go do a drive-by. Let's go.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.516
Hold on. No, no. See, I understand.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.727
They had to sell their house
to pay my mortgage.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.121
Honey, sit down.
Let me explain something to you.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.318
Somebody ran the game on you.

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:09.071
Ain't nobody going to give up
their nice, comfortable house

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.737
to come live in your house,
unless you have the nicer house.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:14.285
Your daughter has
run a game on you, honey.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.908
- Is your house nicer than hers?
- Yes.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:20.012
That's why the hell she was in your house.
Don't think she did you no favors.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.084
Don't sit here making
excuses for this child.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.211
Well, it ain't her.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:26.668
That's an excuse. Who is it?

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:28.471
- It's her husband.
- How is it her husband?

01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:29.587
He pays all the bills.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.424
I don't give a damn how many bills you pay,

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:35.894
you ain't gonna put
my mama out of her house.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:43.810
That don't make no sense to me at all.
You got to explain that to me.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:46.337
- No, see, you don't understand.
- What do I not understand?

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:50.446
Well, when she was little,
a lot of things happened to her,

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:51.947
I just need to be there for her.

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:53.295
Please don't tell me you're
one of them parents

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:56.549
that believes anything your child says.
Any time they say it, however they say it.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.075
I can't stand parents like that.

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:01.957
They don't go and verify nothing,
they just believe what their child says.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.841
I believe in trust, but verify,
do you hear me'?

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:10.604
'Cause, just 'cause it's your child,
they are capable of making mistakes.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.314
That's why you have to
get all the information

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:13.898
before you go running to their defense.

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:17.085
I know somebody like this who had the
principal call and said the child did it.

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:19.488
The school teacher called
and said the child did it.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.479
The janitor called and
said the child did it.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.142
The bus driver called
and said the child did it.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:28.314
Homeless man on the street found a phone
and called and said the child did it.

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:32.908
A Chihuahua was walking past saying,
"He did it. He did it. He did it."

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.533
And she didn't believe nothing.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.841
And when you do that to a child,
you are setting yourself up for failure.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:42.136
'Cause you're going to find yourself, when
that child grows up, on the witness stand.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.220
Sitting there, trying to convince
12 members of his peers

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:47.590
that he did not commit the crime
that you believe he did not do it.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.602
- Do you hear what I'm telling you?
- You're right.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:52.049
I know it. This is what you
got to understand about children,

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.505
hear me clearly when I say this.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.006
You cannot do that to a child.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.510
You cannot empower a child that way.
Find out the truth first.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:08:59.819
Do you hear what I'm telling you?

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:03.348
That's why... Look at all these parents. You
can't do that to a child, that's crippling.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.192
Like all these parents, they give
their child everything they ask for.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:09.651
That is the worst thing
you can do for a child,

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.941
is to give them everything they ask for.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.210
And I know what it is, you feel guilty.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.837
A lot of parents feel guilty
'cause the child went through something,

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:19.214
you weren't there,
you were supposed to be there,

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.536
you were working, you had to do this...
To hell with that.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.327
The Bible gave you one commandment.
"Be fruitful and multiply."

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.913
The rest of it's on the damn child to
figure out what the hell's going on.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.505
But what I'm saying is,
when you do that to a child

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:34.188
you cripple them, you handicap them
by giving them everything they want.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:35.981
They don't know what it's like
in the real world.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.508
I remember Cora came home one day,
talking about she wanted $5

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:41.515
'cause the neighbor had given
her daughter $5.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.437
Well, she was a single mama,
she gave her $5,

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:44.865
I said, "I don't care, you my child.

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:47.743
"I don't care what's happening next door,
this is what goes on in this house.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.953
"If you want anything in this house,
you got to work for it."

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:50.978
That's right.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:52.538
She said, "That's fine,
I'll just do what I got to do.

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:55.203
"I just need $5, 'cause I want to go
buy me some toys." Okay, fine.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:57.452
"What do I need to do?"
"Go wash the dishes."

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.463
She washes the dishes, come back in
with her hand out for the $5.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:00.881
I said, "Baby, it don't work that way.

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:04.051
"You don't get it just 'cause you asked for
it. Now you got to go clean the closet."

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:05.998
So she cleaned that
closet up all night long.

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:08.329
Next morning she said, "I get my $5?"

01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:11.100
"No, you don't get it yet. When you
get home you still got more chores.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:14.164
"I need you to wash them clothes and when
you come up here, clean that oven."

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.009
So she came back and she washed
the clothes clean, "Can I have my $5?"

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:18.357
"No, baby, you can't have it yet."

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.930
This went on Monday, this went on Tuesday,

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:24.266
by Wednesday she had cut the grass,
mowed the lawn, changed the lawn-mower.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:27.269
By Thursday, she had washed the car
and changed my oil.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:28.895
You understand?

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.818
And by Friday she was so tired she said,

01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.653
"I don't even want the money now."

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:35.958
I said, "No, baby,
this is how it works in the real world.

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.076
"You work like a dog
and by Friday, it's pay-day.

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:39.152
"So here it is.

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.784
"So, I'm gonna make you work like a dog.

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:46.301
"And then I'm gonna dangle a little carrot
in front of you on Friday

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.469
"so you'll come back on Monday.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:48.995
"So, here's your money on Friday."

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.795
And she said thank you, and then she
went to count it and it was $3.18.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.001
She said, "I asked for $5."

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.770
I said, "Well, hell, I
took taxes out of it.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.274
"That's how it is in the real world."

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.788
That's what I'm saying.
That's what children need to know.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:05.057
That's what children need.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.097
That's what children need to understand.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.284
They need to know the value of a dollar.
Just 'cause you have it to give it to them,

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:12.077
don't mean that they should have it,
do you understand?

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.871
- You're right.
- 'Cause you do that to them as children,

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:15.989
when they grow up,
they have no sense of nothing.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.083
They leave your house
and go get married to somebody,

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.461
they think that man or that woman
is supposed to give them everything

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:21.532
that Mama or Daddy did.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:24.423
That ain't the real world. You want
something, you got to go your ass to work.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:25.727
That's how it works around here.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.050
- You hear me?
- That's right.

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:28.635
'Cause it's crazy, I just
look at these people,

01:11:28.659 --> 01:11:30.627
grown folks, grown 40-year-olds,
sitting there,

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.331
counting on Mama and Daddy, that is crazy.

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:36.172
You cannot empower a child that much.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:37.710
Everybody on this earth...

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:38.896
Let me tell you something about guilt.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.718
Guilt will mess you up and your child.

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:43.554
You can't let guilt rule how you raise.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.678
'Cause you'll find yourself doing things
you ain't supposed to.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:50.015
God has designed the midnight for
everybody on this earth to go through.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:53.355
He has designed it, he didn't allow...
He did not make it happen,

01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:55.607
but he allows it to happen, all right?

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:58.860
And the reason for that midnight for you
to go through, is not to destroy you.

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:00.366
It is to make you stronger.

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:02.193
And make you better, you understand?

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:04.963
You're not supposed to despise it,
you're supposed to walk on through it.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.661
If God has designed a midnight
for your child,

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.913
<i>as</i> much <i>as</i> you love your child,

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:12.596
and you come running there, rescuing
them every time they go through...

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.182
Every time they go through something,
you thereto see them through it.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:17.208
Then you are not helping them at all.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:21.550
You are blocking the thing that God has
set up for them to make them strong.

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:23.055
I don't think you following me.

01:12:23.548 --> 01:12:24.549
I'm following.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.276
Let me break it down to you this way.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.380
If God has designed
something for them to go through,

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:29.530
that's going to make them stronger.

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:32.228
And every time they go through it,
they can come to you and get it.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.899
Then what do they need God for?

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:35.560
Yeah.

01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:37.691
You become their god, do you understand?

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.818
What you need to know about him,
he's a jealous God.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.571
He will have no other gods before him.
Do you hear me?

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:48.906
I know it hurts to have your child
go through something.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.009
I know it's tough, I know it's hard,
to watch them go through,

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.786
but, honey, you have to let them
bump their head every now and then

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.334
so that they can become full-grown adults

01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:59.133
who know how to handle anything,
who can stand up on their feet.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.508
Your job is not to keep them
from the cradle to the grave.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:04.022
Your job is to keep them from the cradle,

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:07.234
let them grow up and figure out how the hell
they gonna get to the grave themselves.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:08.305
Do you understand?

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:10.529
I never thought about it like that.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:13.978
You ain't been thinking about much
is all I'm gonna tell you.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.701
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.819
- I understand.
- Let your children grow up.

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:19.413
And as long <i>as</i> I'm on this subject,

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:22.407
I'm gonna go on and say this,
'cause I think it just needs to be said.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:26.035
All of y'all who've got these
grown children living in your house,

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.492
I got four words for you.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:30.118
Put that ass out.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.766
I don't understand that.
And I'm not talking about all of them.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:40.791
That's what...

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:43.353
if you're going through something,
having a little financial trouble

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.314
or you're going through divorce
or things are tough right now.

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.441
You need to go home for a while,
that's what family is for.

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:48.512
To be there for you.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:49.759
For a little while.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:51.978
For a little while.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.114
'Cause when you come back to my house,

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:55.185
I'm like a landlord.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:58.036
I want a move-in date
and I want a move-the-hell-out-date, too.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.495
And don't come up in there,
talking about you need a week

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.599
when you know you need six months,
trying to fool me.

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:05.944
'Cause if you tell me you need a week,
on the seventh day I'm gonna rest.

01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:11.581
And on the eighth day I'm gonna
pack you the hell up out of there.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.135
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.262
'Cause think about this,
I'm not talking about them children,

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.598
I'm talking about them 40-year-olds
that are living in your basement.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:20.623
Yes.

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:23.129
Talking about,
"Mama, can I borrow your car?"

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:26.133
"Hell, no, you can't borrow my car.
You 40 years old."

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:27.259
That's right.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:29.024
But for a lot of parents
that empowered them,

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.471
then they wonder why all
the other grown children are mad,

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:33.820
'cause you got this same child,
keeps coming back to the house

01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:34.845
over and over again.

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:36.990
You keep... These are supposed to be
the best years of your life

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:39.694
and you are letting this child come in
and ruin that moment for you.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.727
That's crazy as hell. I don't understand.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.771
Put 'em out, put 'em out.

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:44.901
It's like a eagle.

01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:50.112
You know what a eagle do? I love nature.
God teaches us through nature.

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:51.703
This is what an eagle do.

01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:53.702
Before an eagle
have the little chick-chickies,

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:56.583
eagle make a nest out of thorns.

01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:58.494
- Why they do that?
- Yes.

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:00.296
So, when the babies come,

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:03.771
they take the feathers and they put it down
on top of the thorns, so they comfortable.

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:05.921
So when the babies come,
they're so comfortable.

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:10.173
But when the babies stay too long,
the eagle fans the feathers.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:14.469
So all that's left in the nest is thorns.

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:17.263
So no matter which way
the little eagle in there goes,

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.689
they can't get comfortable.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:20.367
And if they still won't
leave, she'd take them

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:22.393
- and she'd throw them out of the nest.
- What?

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.821
Yes, she do. And watch them,
they'd be flapping and flapping

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.041
then right before they hit the ground,
she'd go in and swoop down,

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:29.501
pick them up and bring them back up.

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:30.526
You understand?

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.828
Do she go in there
and put some more feathers?

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:35.103
Hell, no. You know what she do?
She kick them out again.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:36.925
And they go down flapping
and flapping and flapping.

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:38.468
She'd run down and catch them,
and by the third time

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:40.053
she do that, they're flying on their own.

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:41.078
Do you understand?

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:44.207
Sometime, honey, you just got to
make it uncomfortable for your child

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.770
to get the hell up out of your house.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.602
Take the feathers out of the nest.

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:50.721
Start with the television
and work your way to the PlayStation.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.504
- You hear what I'm telling you?
- That's a good one.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.183
That's all I'm saying,
that's all I'm saying.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:01.357
Let me tell you something about this
daughter of yours. You got two of them.

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:02.729
The one that's on them drugs.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:06.271
I've never met one child in this whole life
that said, "I wanna be..."

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:07.622
You ask a child what they want to be,

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:11.196
they say, a doctor, a lawyer, they never
say, "I want to be a drug addict."

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:14.279
Something happens to people in their life.

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:16.577
That's why you can never judge nobody.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.666
'Cause something happens that makes
people go in certain directions

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.460
and wherever it happens,

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:24.873
if you can take them back to that point,
you can take them to the healing.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:28.060
But you got to figure out how to get them
back to where they went off track.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.144
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.728
Every time there is a train derailment,

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:32.638
they want to know
where the incident happened.

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.224
You got to take them back to the incident
to make them heal.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.643
Talk to your daughter, child,
don't judge her.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:39.978
- She's gonna lie.
- I know.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:42.640
Yeah, a crackhead will lie
when the truth will do.

01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:45.643
But you talk to her.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:46.870
And then that other daughter of yours,

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:48.988
the one I want to see
all the papers that you signed

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:51.541
for her to have your house,
tell her we're gonna come pay her a visit.

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:52.862
Me, you and my lawyer.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:55.572
- You and your lawyer?
- Yeah, he in this purse.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.829
He's with the firm of
Smith & Wesson Esquire.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:04.638
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.306
Now go on and call.
You ain't supposed to be on the phone.

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:09.142
I'm gonna talk to this girl 'cause I know
that boy on his way over here.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.009
Go on and talk, I'm gonna keep her busy.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:16.131
What you doing?

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:17.641
I was talking to the universe.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.310
Child, the universe.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:25.441
And then I was going to partake
of the fruit of the Ignatius tree.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.860
- The who tree?
- The Ignatius tree.

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:29.979
- The...
- Ignatius.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:31.443
Oh, wow. What that do?

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:33.316
It brings me calm and balance.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.192
Another kind of tree do that for me.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:45.286
How long you've been
on this spiritual journey?

01:17:45.452 --> 01:17:46.704
About two months.

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:48.431
You been on this journey two months?

01:17:48.455 --> 01:17:50.173
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wow. That's good.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.001
What got you on this spiritual journey?

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:54.549
- What do you mean?
- Something had to get you on it.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:57.222
You ain't just start on it all alone.

01:17:57.548 --> 01:17:59.428
'Cause Dalia tells me,
you used to go to church.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.767
- Yeah.
- Then you left.

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:02.553
- Yeah.
- And went on a journey.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.350
Into the universe.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:07.312
Going where no man has gone before.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.492
Yeah, I guess so.

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:17.864
Yeah'? Wow.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:19.679
What happened to make you do that?

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.381
You know, usually when a woman
goes through a break-up,

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:23.885
she'll cut all her hair off, change...
You know how y'all do...

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:25.321
I mean, you know how we do.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.584
We all change...

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.089
I'm sorry, you know how we do,
we change up something.

01:18:38.339 --> 01:18:39.966
I think it was just time.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:41.600
Thought it was time?

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:42.968
Ain't nothing happened?

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:45.363
Ain't have nothing to do with that man
you were messing around with,

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:48.015
the married man?
The one Hattie was talking about?

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.690
Who left his wife
and then didn't come marry you,

01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:53.009
went and married another woman?

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:57.241
Yeah, there was a third spoke in the wheel
and you didn't know about it.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:18:59.826
Was he in the church?

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:01.704
Yes, ma'am, he was a member.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.551
A member of the church, there you go.

01:19:04.448 --> 01:19:06.121
Now it all makes sense.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.543
Man breaks your heart, you get mad at God.

01:19:09.119 --> 01:19:11.167
Honey, you can't compare God to man.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:13.883
Any man, any woman,
any human being on this earth

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:16.228
is capable of breaking your heart,
no matter how much they love you.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.812
Because we're all human, we all
make mistakes, do you understand?

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:20.843
So you can't blame God on that.

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:23.176
You can't go running out of church
'cause a man hurt you.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.445
If you do that you will never find peace.
Do you hear me?

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.437
You got to know God for God
and man for man.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.732
He's not a man that he should lie.
Do you understand?

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.851
I hear you. But I...

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:33.523
I couldn't go back into that church.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.776
I know I was wrong,
I take responsibility for that.

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:38.778
But those people in that church judged me.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:39.960
I couldn't go back in there.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:41.086
Yeah, that bothers me
about a lot of churches.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:44.159
A lot of folks in church,
they're quick to forget.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.331
So quick to forget where they come from.

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.162
Like they always had it together.

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:50.415
Like they can't remember
four or five years ago

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:52.305
when they were struggling,
trying to get through something.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.807
That's what bothers me,
people coming to church

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.475
and they're hurt and they're broken,
then they leave

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:58.061
they're even more hurt 'cause they
came to church looking for help.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:00.463
And somebody up in there
made them so upset

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:01.690
and worse than what they were.

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.817
But this is what you need to understand
about the church, honey.

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:05.468
The church is just like a hospital.

01:20:06.093 --> 01:20:07.595
When people go to the hospital...

01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:09.281
This is where people
have their misconception.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:10.323
This is where you mess up, 'cause you think

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:12.467
church is supposed to be
this perfect place. It's not.

01:20:13.183 --> 01:20:15.436
The church is a place
for people who need something.

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:18.039
Like the hospital.
If you have a cold, you go to the hospital.

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:19.374
You need surgery, you go to the hospital.

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:20.878
There are departments for everything.

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:22.711
If you have an emergency,
you go to the emergency room.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.337
If you're in intensive
care, you go to the ICU.

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:26.659
All of that is in a hospital.
The church is the same way.

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:28.967
When you go to church,
you go up in there looking for healing.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:31.414
Whatever you need,
whatever surgeries you need in your life

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:33.582
you asking God to help you with,
you understand?

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.765
When you go up in there,
just like when you go to the hospital,

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:36.850
you looking to see the doctor.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:38.893
Don't go up in there
looking for nobody but the doctor.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:40.043
You hear me?

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:43.927
So when you go to...
You ain't understanding what I'm saying.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.694
When you go to the hospital,
you go in there looking for a doctor.

01:20:47.718 --> 01:20:48.844
So all I'm telling you is,

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:51.114
when you go to church,
you better go in there looking for God.

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:53.732
'Cause anything else is up in there.
Do you understand?

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:55.142
Okay.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:56.870
Let me make it a little clearer for you.

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:58.538
Just like people go to the ICU
and the emergency room,

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:01.207
there are all these little cliques
and these little things in the hospital.

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.876
And there are all of them
little cliques in the church.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.294
That's where the liars can find the liars,

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:06.078
the whore-mongers
can find the whore-mongers.

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:07.871
It's already up in there,
do you understand?

01:21:07.988 --> 01:21:08.989
Yes, I do.

01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.467
That's why when you go up in there,

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:12.427
you better have your eyes
on God and nothing else.

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:13.720
- Do you understand?
- I do understand.

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:15.542
Or you gonna get yourself hurt.

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:17.724
Honey, keep your eye on God
and you won't make no mistakes.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.748
Just like Peter,
when he was walking on that water.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.927
And Jonah and that whale
passed right by him

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:24.175
and messed him up. And he started sinking.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:26.264
You got to understand that, honey.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:30.886
Okay.

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:34.182
I'm telling you, it was
Free <i>Willy,</i> I saw it.

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:41.693
Okay, it's been two months
since I've been to church,

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.052
but I don't know if it was that.

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:45.033
Okay, honey, well,
you don't read your Bible.

01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:46.110
Okay.

01:21:46.276 --> 01:21:48.546
Do you understand what I'm saying?
All I'm telling you, honey,

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.757
is keep your eye on God,
that's all I want you to understand.

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:53.455
I understand that, it's just that
I'm so tired of getting hurt.

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:56.461
I thought he was the one,
I was praying he was the one.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.339
You was praying that the married man
was the one for you?

01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:04.321
You really have been eating the fruit of
the ignorant-ass tree, right there, honey.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.598
I never heard it out loud like that.

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:14.447
Yeah, that's the problem with a lot of
people, they don't say stuff out loud

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:16.616
so they can hear.
You need to hear stuff said out loud.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.951
You can't pray that a married man...

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:20.478
God does things in decency and in order.

01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:23.405
God don't hook you up with somebody
that's already hooked up.

01:22:26.483 --> 01:22:28.461
And let me tell you, you got to be
careful with them people, honey,

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.362
that you meet that are already married.

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:32.298
I don't care if it's a
woman, a man, whatever,

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:34.551
if you meet somebody that's in
a relationship, married, altogether,

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:37.929
you got to be careful with them, 'cause they
are thieves and they don't even know it.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.421
- Thieves?
- They are thieves.

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:43.000
They have come to steal the best thing
that God has given you.

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:44.543
Your youth.

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:50.015
You'll be hooked up in a relationship
with them for 15, 20 years,

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:52.760
and realize you missed
the best days of your life.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:56.772
'Cause in your 20s you think that's cute.
"Yeah, he married, but it's all right.

01:22:56.847 --> 01:23:00.522
"He on my... I got my list.
And he got everything I need on my list.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:03.016
"He's tall, he's handsome,
he makes this much money.

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:04.938
"We gonna get us
a nice house in the suburbs.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:07.000
"We gonna live in Buckhead,
then we're going to Alpharetta,

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:08.150
"we gonna go over here."

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:10.611
You have your list, your five-page list.

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:12.450
When you're in your 20s.

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:16.663
You get in your 30s, you start
playing scratch off with that list.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:24.425
By the time you get to them 40s and 50s,
that five page list has become five words.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:25.584
What?

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.469
"Just let him be breathing."

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:30.690
- That's five.
- Do you understand?

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:31.806
Yes, ma'am.

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:33.725
Do you hear what I'm telling you?

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:37.684
You got to understand that, honey.
You can't let people...

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:41.393
Nothing sadder to me than to see
a 50-year-old woman in the club.

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:46.238
Down at the end of the bar,
with the same dress on

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.733
that the 20-year-old got on
at the other end of the bar.

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.793
Talking about, "I still got it."

01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:53.320
No, you don't. Time to go home, honey.
Go home.

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:55.872
But, look, I don't judge her.

01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:59.418
'Cause somebody stole something from
her and she's trying to get it back.

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.733
Somebody stole the best years of her life
and she's still trying to hold on to it.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.168
- Do you understand?
- Yes, yes.

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.626
That's why you can't let people
steal stuff from you, honey.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.426
Them people are thieves.

01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:11.468
You got to do better than
that in your own life. You hear me?

01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:13.257
I hear you. I just...

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:16.636
I'm here and I see these people
and it makes me nervous.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.320
I'm scared I'm gonna be just like them.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.264
I know, 'cause you look
at your life sometimes

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:23.469
and it looks like you got more years
behind you than you have in front of you.

01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:24.860
And it's a scary time.

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:27.247
And a lot of folk go through it,
more women go through it than men.

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:28.873
Where they get to the point
where they realize

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:30.337
they don't have everything they had.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.126
They don't have the love that they wanted,

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:33.527
they're not married yet,

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:36.256
but they got money, got the house,
got the career, got all that stuff,

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.497
but they don't have the love.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.379
And that's a scary place to find yourself

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:41.261
especially when you're
looking at getting older.

01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:42.912
But you have to understand something,

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:46.215
sometimes being alone does not
necessarily mean being lonely.

01:24:46.623 --> 01:24:48.091
You hear me?

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:50.544
You have to learn how to be by yourself,

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:53.756
and sometimes
God will leave you by yourself

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:56.718
until you learn how to be by yourself.

01:24:57.801 --> 01:25:00.179
'Cause, see, if you ain't ready
to be by yourself,

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:02.685
then people will really make a fool
out of you.

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.404
'Cause if you don't know how to be alone,

01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:06.943
people will be able to run
any kind of game on you they want.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:08.955
'Cause they can threaten you
by walking out the door.

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:11.379
- Right, right.
- "If you don't do this, I'm going to leave."

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.626
"if you don't deal with this,
I'm going to leave."

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:14.711
- You understand?
- I understand.

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:17.088
And there's a lot of people,
there's a lot of women who're like,

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:18.580
"Okay, well, please don't leave."

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.123
To the hell with that.

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:23.595
You better not tell me you'd leave
because I would've packed

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:25.997
before you get, "I'm lea..."
out of your mouth.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:30.588
There'll be a cab outside waiting on you,
do you hear me?

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.214
I got the gift of goodbye.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:35.889
I will pack you the hell up so quick
your head will spin.

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:38.234
- Do you hear what I'm telling you?
- I hear what you're saying.

01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:40.236
That's what I'm saying to you.
You gotta understand it.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.261
'Cause you can't...

01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:43.973
All these lists and all this stuff
about being lonely,

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:46.951
"Gotta have this," like my aunt,
I'm gonna tell you. This is a true story.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.228
My aunt was in love with this man.

01:25:49.519 --> 01:25:51.362
In love with the man. He was perfect.

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:54.783
On her list. Everything.
But he wasn't no good for her.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:57.281
But there was another man
she never paid any attention to.

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:58.504
'Cause he wasn't on the list.

01:25:58.528 --> 01:26:00.747
Everything about the list
was wrong with him.

01:26:01.365 --> 01:26:03.367
The list say "tall," he was short.

01:26:05.369 --> 01:26:07.542
The list say "handsome," he was...

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:14.549
The list say "fit," he was fat.

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.659
And she didn't pay no attention to him,
but the man loved her with the purest love,

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:20.467
she didn't even know
how much he loved her.

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:21.990
And he would just do things for her.

01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:24.225
She had four boys
she was raising by herself,

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:26.147
going to work day and night.

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:28.146
And he was a watcher.

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:30.411
When it was raining, he go pick up,
'cause she didn't have a car.

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:31.704
He went and bought a car,
a little raggedy car,

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:34.290
and left it at the house one day.
She was so happy to have that car.

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:36.292
She thought it got the best gas mileage
in the world.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:37.960
She didn't know he would come
in the middle of the night,

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:39.104
and just fill it up for her.

01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:40.779
Little things like that.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.079
She'd work all day, he'd...

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:44.249
This man loved her purely.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.177
The man that she was in love with
kept breaking her heart.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.846
One night she got tired and said,
"I ain't gonna deal with that no more."

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.919
And her and that man spent some time,
they had a beautiful night.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:53.247
She fell in love with him.

01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:55.885
Seven years he chased her.

01:26:56.336 --> 01:26:57.588
And he died the next year.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:00.636
Wasted all of that time.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:03.036
Do you understand how people come
to steal things from you?

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:05.113
Wasted all of that time being hooked up
with some fool

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:06.447
and missed the best man in her life.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:08.908
To this day, she'll tell you,
"That was the best man in my life."

01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:11.310
- Do you understand?
- Wow. Yes, that's sad.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.359
Yeah, but it's all right, honey.
That's why you got to wait on God.

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:17.863
See, you gotta give up them lists
and all of that stuff.

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:20.364
I notice in <i>Think Like A</i> Man
they say, "Make your list,"

01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:22.764
but I don't believe you oughta have a list,
you understand?

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:24.882
You gotta get to a point
where you just say,

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:26.874
you know what? Let me explain
something to you.

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:29.169
Whatever you've got for me, God,
I'm gonna take it.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:32.248
'Cause sometime love don't come the way
you want it to come.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:33.433
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:36.051
Sometime love have a hole
in the top of the afro.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:45.310
Sometime, love don't have a six-pack,
it have a done-lap.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.353
A done-lap?

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:49.935
Yeah, the belly done lapped over the belt.

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:57.522
- Wow.
- You gotta get it the way it come.

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.286
- You understand?
- I hear you. I hear you.

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:00.626
Let me talk to you about
this universe thing.

01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:03.588
'Cause I just started hearing about
this universe stuff about 20 years ago,

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:05.590
before that I ain't never heard
nothing about this universe.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:08.242
This thing is scaring me 'cause
people take the Bible

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:10.578
and they mix it up with a little this
and a little that,

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.305
and they mix up this and they mix up that.

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:14.002
Before you know it, you all confused.

01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:15.349
They've got Christians walking around,

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:17.643
talking about the universe
all mixed up with all this stuff.

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:19.795
Don't even know that they're
on a whole other path.

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:22.523
Don't even know that you're off base
with what the Bible say,

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:25.485
because you're over there talking about
the universe and all this other stuff.

01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:27.153
'Cause I don't understand.
I ain't reading nowhere

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:28.817
where the universe was nailed to a cross.

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:32.200
And I don't know why you would sit
around worshipping the universe,

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:35.694
when you can worship the creator
of the universe. Do you hear me?

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.073
That's all I'm saying to you, honey.

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:41.654
- I understand.
- You hear me?

01:28:42.025 --> 01:28:44.337
Go back to what you know.
Go back to what worked for your mama,

01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:47.456
and your grandmama, and great-granddad,
grandpa. That was Jesus.

01:28:47.531 --> 01:28:49.579
They was up all night
calling on the name of Jesus,

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:51.010
walking the floor, praying for you,

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:52.957
laying hands on you
in the middle of the night.

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:54.834
When you got sick,
they was calling on Jesus.

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:56.516
They had the prayer meetings in the house.

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.518
There ain't nothing wrong with that name,
it still works.

01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:00.561
He ain't gotten away from us,
we getting away from him.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:02.087
Do you hear what I'm telling you?

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.171
Yes, ma'am.

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:06.141
You got to get rid of that, honey.
You got to go back to church.

01:29:06.216 --> 01:29:08.528
You got to go back to what you know.
You got to go back to your roots.

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:09.553
Go back to church.

01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:12.856
I ain't going, but you go right on up
in there and have yourself a good time.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.061
Now, wait a minute.

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.744
Now, you just said all of that about me
going to church and you won't go?

01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:19.942
No, not till they get a smoking section
and a bar up in there. I'm not going.

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:21.113
- In the church?
- Yes.

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.533
You all have a communion,
I'm having Patron. What's up.

01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:29.205
I don't think that's gonna happen.

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:30.828
I don't think I'm going.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:34.595
- You hear what I'm telling you?
- I do hear what you're saying.

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:37.498
You've given me a lot to think about
and I'm gonna pray about it.

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:39.174
You gonna pray about it to who?

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:42.423
- To Jesus.
- Praise God. Hallelujah.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:44.313
- Wow.
- You got to do something nice for people,

01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:46.023
that's why I came here
up here to talk to you.

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.549
- Thank you so much.
- You so welcome.

01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:48.985
You gotta do something nice.
Now do something nice.

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:51.009
Go on, sign the papers
so I can get on out of here.

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:55.896
- Just a little while longer.
- You're so by the book. Lord.

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:58.568
- But thank you, though.
- You're very welcome, honey.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.417
I hurt my head. I walked into the wall.

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:26.630
Can you feel that?

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:29.758
There's air on your head.

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:33.390
See, now go on up in there
and shut her down, son.

01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:36.866
Walk up in there. You tell this woman... I've
already tilled the soil for you, she ready.

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:38.159
- All right.
- All you gotta do is walk up in there

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:39.856
and say, "Look here, baby. We going out."

01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:45.490
You can do it. You can do it.

01:31:00.622 --> 01:31:02.044
Ms. Carla.

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:09.715
I came here this evening

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:12.551
to ask you if you would allow me

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:14.807
to take you out for an evening of pleasure.

01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:19.684
So that I might treat you exactly the way
that a woman should be treated.

01:31:21.685 --> 01:31:23.062
Now, what do you say?

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:27.691
I don't know what to say.

01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:29.026
Ms. Carla...

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:35.791
<i>Why are you settling to be all alone</i>

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:39.961
<i>When I'm right here waiting for you</i>

01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:47.011
<i>Tell me why you keep pushing me away</i>

01:31:49.254 --> 01:31:52.804
<i>When I'm right here for you</i>

01:31:52.882 --> 01:31:59.857
<i>Lady, just run, run to me</i>

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:05.817
<i>I'll take care of you</i>

01:32:05.895 --> 01:32:11.902
<i>Lady, run, run to me</i>

01:32:14.112 --> 01:32:21.087
<i>I'm right here for you, girl</i>

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:27.631
<i>Now I know you probably don't believe
in love sometimes</i>

01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:34.429
<i>You've got a right to
think that love is blind</i>

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:40.105
<i>But all I ask is that you open
your heart to me</i>

01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:43.184
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

01:32:43.266 --> 01:32:50.275
<i>I'm begging you, begging you
Begging you, please</i>

01:32:50.607 --> 01:32:56.705
<i>Run, run to me</i>

01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:02.878
<i>I'll take care of you, baby, baby</i>

01:33:02.952 --> 01:33:06.252
<i>I'm down on my knees
Begging you, please</i>

01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:09.460
<i>59991719 you, begging you, begging you
59991719 you, please</i>

01:33:09.542 --> 01:33:15.220
<i>Let me, let me take care of you</i>

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:17.141
<i>Once</i>

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:32.571
<i>You ain't gotta worry about nothing
baby, baby, baby, baby</i>

01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:40.257
Now, Ms. Carla, will you allow me...

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.533
Yes.

01:33:44.494 --> 01:33:47.498
Yes. I would like that very much.

01:33:47.747 --> 01:33:49.920
All right. Very good.

01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:51.751
God, you work fast.

01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:55.672
The wedding was beautiful, Mom.

01:33:56.714 --> 01:33:58.887
I wish you could've been there.

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:02.516
I miss you, Mom.

01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:07.726
Did you come to take me home?

01:34:08.852 --> 01:34:10.445
You're talking today.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.363
Yes, did you come to take me home?

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.778
No, Mama, you gotta stay here.

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:18.283
I can't take care of you.
With my job, and the kids and...

01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:20.739
And Frank is off in Afghanistan. I can't.

01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:22.077
I want to go home.

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:24.117
I know, but this is your home now.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.577
I don't like it here.

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:28.914
I know, but this is the
best that I could do.

01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:31.629
Fine. The water is on.

01:34:31.708 --> 01:34:34.257
No, Mama, please don't go.
Please stay with me.

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:35.882
Stay with me. How are you?

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:39.056
I'm fine. It just gets
chilly here at night.

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:41.893
I'll be sure they bring you
more blankets then, okay?

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:43.845
Thank you, nurse.

01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:46.064
Mom, I'm Sue Ellen.

01:34:46.139 --> 01:34:47.186
Who?

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:49.108
Mom, I'm Sue Ellen, you know me.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.061
Please remember me. Look at me.
You know me.

01:34:51.561 --> 01:34:52.562
Where are your brothers?

01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:54.192
They're busy, Mama.

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:57.401
Well, fine then. I won't play with you
or your toys anymore, Carol.

01:34:58.067 --> 01:35:00.115
Mom, Carol is your sister.

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:02.071
That figures.

01:35:02.572 --> 01:35:04.666
I love you. Do you hear me?

01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:06.701
Are we in Hawaii at the beach house?

01:35:07.118 --> 01:35:08.290
No, Mama.

01:35:09.662 --> 01:35:11.209
I hear her talking.

01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:15.168
She talks sometimes, but she doesn't know
who I am or that I'm here.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:17.712
This is so hard. I need her in my life.

01:35:17.795 --> 01:35:20.298
I just want to talk with her
and I want her to talk to me.

01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:23.051
Why?

01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:27.268
Because I love her.

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:29.565
This old selfish woman?

01:35:29.933 --> 01:35:31.401
She wasn't selfish.

01:35:31.476 --> 01:35:32.773
She had to be selfish.

01:35:32.936 --> 01:35:34.609
No, she wasn't selfish at all.

01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:38.909
You mean, this woman
would give of herself to other people?

01:35:38.983 --> 01:35:40.701
Yes, all the time.

01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:43.659
Well, y'all must not have had
no good memories at all, not one.

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:46.450
Yes, we did. We had great memories.

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:48.542
- And she was a good woman?
- Yes.

01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:50.179
When she was in her right mind,
she was a good woman,

01:35:50.203 --> 01:35:52.126
she wasn't selfish and all of that stuff?

01:35:52.205 --> 01:35:53.627
Yes.

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.133
I thought she was selfish <i>as</i> hell.

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:57.384
Why?

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.507
'Cause of you.

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.384
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:02.807
'Cause you sit here 10, 12 hours a day.

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:08.521
Only a selfish person would want you sitting
here all this time like this, honey.

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.690
- You understand what I'm trying to tell you?
- Yeah.

01:36:10.974 --> 01:36:13.147
This woman, hear me good when I say this,

01:36:13.226 --> 01:36:15.829
if this were me, I would not want
my daughter sitting here all this time.

01:36:15.853 --> 01:36:18.697
You got children to raise.
You got a whole life to live.

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:21.572
And anybody who loved you
would not want you doing this to yourself.

01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:22.910
I know, but it's hard.

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:24.954
I understand that,
but you know what's unfair?

01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:27.202
For you to reduce her life to this moment.

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:30.660
You're looking at the end, honey.
You gotta remember the whole total life.

01:36:30.994 --> 01:36:32.763
You gotta remember all the joy
and all the peace.

01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:36.132
You gotta give each one of them the same
amount of energy, you understand?

01:36:36.207 --> 01:36:38.710
You can't just reduce it to this moment.

01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:41.647
This woman, if she wasn't selfish,
she wouldn't want that.

01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:43.594
I know I wouldn't want Cora to sit here.

01:36:43.673 --> 01:36:46.847
First of all, Cora ain't gonna sit here
all this time like this.

01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:50.430
Unless there's a snack machine up under
that bed, Cora ain't gonna do that.

01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:54.025
It's good to see you smile, honey.

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:56.648
- Thank you.
- But you gotta learn how to start to let go.

01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.192
How do I let go?

01:36:58.271 --> 01:36:59.957
Well, you've already started,
and I'll tell you how.

01:36:59.981 --> 01:37:02.126
You put her in a nice place
where people can take care,

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:04.837
and they take good care of her here.
I've watched them, you understand?

01:37:04.861 --> 01:37:08.048
But you gotta learn how to start to let go.
Little by little, that's how you do it.

01:37:08.072 --> 01:37:09.324
Bit by bit.

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:12.536
Instead of staying 10 hours one day,
maybe you'll come and you'll stay nine.

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:14.959
Then you might relapse and come 12.

01:37:15.038 --> 01:37:17.558
See, you go back and forth when
you're going through this kind of stuff.

01:37:17.582 --> 01:37:18.754
You just have to go with it.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.881
But you got children to raise
and a life to live.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.463
And I'm sure this woman
would not want this, honey.

01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:24.923
Let go bit by bit.

01:37:25.048 --> 01:37:26.971
Maybe one day you'll skip a whole day.

01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:28.893
Then you'll find it easier to do.
You hear me?

01:37:29.135 --> 01:37:30.307
I hear you.

01:37:30.386 --> 01:37:31.854
Well, it's good she's loved.

01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:34.658
A lot of folk don't have people to
love them at this part in their life.

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.452
So it's good that she's loved
and good you're here for her.

01:37:36.476 --> 01:37:38.954
That don't mean that you don't love her,
'cause you ain't here.

01:37:38.978 --> 01:37:40.446
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:41.522
Forgive yourself, honey.

01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:43.584
You keep talking about,
"I want this. I want... I...

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:45.736
That's about you, that ain't about her.

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:47.870
- You understand?
- I understand.

01:37:47.945 --> 01:37:49.288
Okay.

01:37:49.489 --> 01:37:50.490
All right, hon.

01:37:50.573 --> 01:37:51.916
- Madea?
- Yes.

01:37:52.158 --> 01:37:54.126
Will you please say a prayer before you go?

01:37:56.162 --> 01:37:58.540
Girl, you ain't seen none of my DVDs,
have you?

01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:13.475
Okay, I got to get out of here.
Time for me to go.

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:14.646
Okay.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:15.741
- Y'all going out?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:38:15.765 --> 01:38:17.485
- Okay, good. Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.

01:38:17.558 --> 01:38:18.911
- Thank you so much.
- And thank you,

01:38:18.935 --> 01:38:20.562
and feel free to volunteer anytime.

01:38:20.645 --> 01:38:23.694
And feel free to hear
me saying, "Hell, no."

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.613
I'll teach you how to get that note.

01:38:25.775 --> 01:38:26.992
Where's he at?

01:38:27.068 --> 01:38:28.240
Hey, son.

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:29.801
Man, you think I'm playing with you?

01:38:29.862 --> 01:38:31.507
Look, I told you not to call my job again.

01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:33.092
- I didn't call your job.
- Yeah, you did.

01:38:33.116 --> 01:38:34.556
Does my job look like a joke to you?

01:38:34.617 --> 01:38:36.290
I got a family to take care of

01:38:36.369 --> 01:38:38.713
that I refuse to neglect, like you did
to me and my mama.

01:38:38.788 --> 01:38:40.432
- Son, I didn't call your job.
- Yes, you did.

01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:42.424
- No, I didn't.
- My boss said that you called

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.881
and asked me to bring you some...

01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:46.804
- Cereal.
- What?

01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:54.854
Hattie?

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:56.271
You ain't asleep.

01:38:57.765 --> 01:38:59.493
You call that boy's job
and asked for cereal?

01:38:59.517 --> 01:39:01.645
So what? He got money.

01:39:01.727 --> 01:39:03.038
What did you say when you called him?

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:04.985
Bring home a box of cereal, please.

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.988
Hey, son. Son!

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:09.698
Son...

01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:11.070
Let me ask you something,

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:13.257
did you know what was going on with
this man and your mama?

01:39:13.281 --> 01:39:14.675
No, ma'am. I just know he wasn't there.

01:39:14.699 --> 01:39:16.385
Wasn't there for you.
Is this what you want?

01:39:16.409 --> 01:39:18.286
- You stand up. This what you want?
- No.

01:39:18.369 --> 01:39:19.996
- Is this what you want?
- No, ma'am.

01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:22.081
This boy need to be with his baby.

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:25.018
You having trouble with that woman,
that won't even talk to her,

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:27.090
but you and that baby mama are adults.

01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:28.922
Act like y'all got some damn sense.

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:30.632
Call each other and have a conversation

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:32.592
so that this man can spend time
with his child.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.098
Every man need to be with their child.
Do you understand?

01:39:35.178 --> 01:39:37.739
That ain't got nothing to do with...
You don't want that child growing up

01:39:37.763 --> 01:39:41.643
'cause you can't be adult enough
to let him spend some time with his daddy.

01:39:41.726 --> 01:39:43.328
You don't want him growing up with that
on his mind,

01:39:43.352 --> 01:39:45.664
thinking his daddy didn't want him
'cause of you. Do you understand?

01:39:45.688 --> 01:39:48.783
It's unfair for him to have to make
a choice between you and his child.

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:51.658
That's all I'm going to say to you.
That's all I got to say about that.

01:39:53.404 --> 01:39:54.951
Now, you.

01:39:56.032 --> 01:39:57.955
- This man wasn't there for you?
- No.

01:39:58.034 --> 01:39:59.081
- Never?
- Never.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.554
- Your mama raised you?
- Yes, she did.

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:02.014
- How's your life?
- My life is great.

01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:03.432
- Got a good job?
- I have a great job.

01:40:03.456 --> 01:40:04.799
Got a great job. You married?

01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:06.268
Yes, ma'am, I am, and I have a son.

01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:07.895
- Yeah? You're a good father?
- I'm a great father.

01:40:07.919 --> 01:40:09.229
- Good husband?
- I'm a great husband.

01:40:09.253 --> 01:40:10.647
- So your mama was good to you?
- She was great.

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:11.732
- Took you to church?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:40:11.756 --> 01:40:12.816
- You're saved?
- Yes, I am.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.966
Why are you mad?

01:40:17.637 --> 01:40:18.638
That's what I wanna know.

01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.324
You can see there's
a little scripture in the Bible say,

01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:22.817
"All things work together for
the good of them that love

01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:24.453
"the Lord and are called
according to his purpose."

01:40:24.477 --> 01:40:26.371
You know what that mean?
Everything that you been through

01:40:26.395 --> 01:40:27.581
will work together for your good.

01:40:27.605 --> 01:40:29.152
Everything, if you let it.

01:40:29.232 --> 01:40:30.992
Everything will work
together for your good.

01:40:31.067 --> 01:40:33.616
If you call and love the Lord.
Do you hear what I'm telling?

01:40:33.736 --> 01:40:36.034
Do you hear what I'm saying to you, son?
Everything.

01:40:36.113 --> 01:40:38.473
You ever thought maybe this man
wasn't supposed to be there?

01:40:38.783 --> 01:40:41.428
If he had been in your life, you might have
turned out to be somebody else.

01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:43.420
But because he wasn't,
look how you turned out.

01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:46.045
God had you covered, son.
This is what I want you to understand.

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:49.290
Ain't no sense in you
sitting around here being mad.

01:40:49.335 --> 01:40:51.337
This man taught you
everything you needed to know.

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:53.514
You know how he taught you? In reverse.

01:40:55.424 --> 01:40:58.018
You do the opposite of what he did
and you have your answers.

01:40:58.094 --> 01:40:59.574
Do you hear what the hell I'm saying?

01:41:01.806 --> 01:41:03.575
And you should have been there,
you should have been there.

01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:04.660
See, a lot of times you go out there.

01:41:04.684 --> 01:41:07.538
You doing all that whoring around and
playing around doing this and doing that

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:08.956
and then you grow up and you get old.

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:10.903
And you're wondering
why you there by yourself.

01:41:10.982 --> 01:41:12.209
'Cause you weren't there for your child.

01:41:12.233 --> 01:41:14.920
Now you got one foot in the grave
and you're trying to make some peace.

01:41:14.944 --> 01:41:17.089
And it's up to him whether he want to
give you the peace or not,

01:41:17.113 --> 01:41:18.131
but, son, let me tell you something.

01:41:18.155 --> 01:41:20.275
If you want to get even
with this man, be nice to him.

01:41:21.284 --> 01:41:24.429
I'm telling you, if you really want to mess
somebody up that done did you wrong,

01:41:24.453 --> 01:41:26.501
be nice to them, show them some kindness.

01:41:26.581 --> 01:41:28.128
They don't know how to handle it.

01:41:28.207 --> 01:41:31.962
It's like putting hot coals on their head.
They can't sleep at night. Do you hear me?

01:41:32.628 --> 01:41:33.908
It's going to be all right, son.

01:41:34.088 --> 01:41:35.089
Talk to this man.

01:41:35.172 --> 01:41:37.095
'Cause you'll be a fool if you don't.

01:41:37.466 --> 01:41:38.718
You spend some time with him.

01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:40.487
He might have something
he can share with you.

01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:43.471
Don't give him no money, but he might
have something he can share with you.

01:41:43.848 --> 01:41:47.193
You hear me? Something that he can share
with you that will help you in the future.

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:50.363
Your child might end up getting older
and in need of some kind of surgery

01:41:50.438 --> 01:41:51.957
or something and you ain't
even talked to this man.

01:41:51.981 --> 01:41:55.002
He got the answer 'cause something going
on with his father and father before him.

01:41:55.026 --> 01:41:57.796
And he can tell you about it 'cause it's
something he might know. Hear me?

01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.581
You owe it to yourself to at least have
the conversation with the man.

01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:03.927
Now go on up there and talk to him.
It ain't gonna kill you to talk to him.

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:05.846
When you get up there,
you know what I want you to tell him?

01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:07.110
The first thing you say to him,

01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:10.667
you say, "Daddy, you gonna take this
toupee off your head right now."

01:42:15.838 --> 01:42:18.442
Well, I'm getting ready to get on up
out of here. It's been a pleasure.

01:42:18.466 --> 01:42:19.683
I'll see y'all later on.

01:42:19.759 --> 01:42:21.028
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

01:42:21.052 --> 01:42:22.099
Thank you so much.

01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:23.947
Hey, Hattie, where you going?
Where you going?

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.063
I'm going with you.

01:42:25.139 --> 01:42:28.035
I knew that. I knew you gonna try that,
Hattie, but let me tell you something.

01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:31.188
I saw when you put your bag in my car
and I took it back out the car.

01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:33.749
And I brought it up there, put it under
your chifforobe, behind the pillow

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:35.500
and put your Froot Loops right back up
under the bed

01:42:35.524 --> 01:42:36.724
which you been trying to hide.

01:42:36.776 --> 01:42:37.878
Everything is back in your room.

01:42:37.902 --> 01:42:39.338
All your little socks,
all your little underwear,

01:42:39.362 --> 01:42:41.256
it's all back up there.
So now you can't go with me.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.508
Yeah, I saw when you did that,
so I brought it back down,

01:42:43.532 --> 01:42:46.081
I got my socks and everything,
put it back in the bag,

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.879
took it back outside and put it in the car.
Now, let's ride.

01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:52.467
All right. No, no. Go ahead. Go on.

01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:53.884
Start the car for me. I'm coming.

01:42:53.959 --> 01:42:55.937
I'm gonna say goodbye.
These people have been so nice.

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:57.241
- Start the car?
- Start the car.

01:42:57.296 --> 01:42:58.718
All right. Deuces.

01:43:01.801 --> 01:43:02.802
Look here.

01:43:02.885 --> 01:43:05.138
I parked in the back.
I'll see you all later.

01:43:14.063 --> 01:43:15.280
<i>Madam.!</i>

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:18.318
<i>Madam.!</i>

01:43:18.651 --> 01:43:20.324
Madea.

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:22.988
Madea.

01:43:23.072 --> 01:43:24.449
Hattie?

01:43:25.783 --> 01:43:26.955
Madea.

01:43:32.623 --> 01:43:34.216
Madea left me.

01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:37.469
That's all right. She'll be back.

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:39.889
She's gonna need me
for one of her drive-bys.

01:43:39.964 --> 01:43:41.011
She'll be back.

01:43:41.757 --> 01:43:44.226
And I'll be right here waiting on her.
That's all right.

01:43:44.301 --> 01:43:46.929
That's all right. She'll be back.
I'm right here. Come get me.

01:43:48.389 --> 01:43:50.187
Say something. Say anything...

01:43:50.266 --> 01:43:52.689
- Mama. Mama.
...I'll slap the teeth out your mouth.

01:43:54.145 --> 01:43:56.944
Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes.

01:44:02.945 --> 01:44:04.242
Don't mind.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.366
Don't worry.

01:44:09.952 --> 01:44:11.374
Rebecca, I love you.

01:44:12.288 --> 01:44:13.961
And I never stopped loving you.

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.042
Mama, I love you, too.

01:44:17.126 --> 01:44:19.345
I mortgaged your house
and I am sorry, Mama.

01:44:20.546 --> 01:44:21.968
Mama...

01:44:22.047 --> 01:44:25.551
<i>I know I messed up</i>

01:44:25.801 --> 01:44:30.523
<i>So many times in my past</i>

01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:33.439
<i>But I got my fife together</i>

01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:38.193
<i>Now I'm free at last</i>

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:41.988
<i>I know you don't believe me</i>

01:44:42.318 --> 01:44:46.414
<i>But I want you to know</i>

01:44:46.489 --> 01:44:50.744
<i>I'm so sorry, Mama</i>

01:44:50.826 --> 01:44:56.959
<i>So please let's go</i>

01:44:57.041 --> 01:45:00.511
<i>I wanna trust you, child</i>

01:45:01.712 --> 01:45:04.215
<i>Really I do</i>

01:45:05.758 --> 01:45:09.137
<i>But it's so hard</i>

01:45:09.929 --> 01:45:13.684
<i>After what we've been through</i>

01:45:14.016 --> 01:45:17.816
<i>But I must tell you</i>

01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:21.525
<i>I'm very proud of you</i>

01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:24.823
<i>One day at a time</i>

01:45:24.902 --> 01:45:29.533
<i>And I promise to trust you</i>

01:45:31.367 --> 01:45:38.376
<i>You're my father and this I know</i>

01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:46.133
<i>But what I've been through
You don't care so</i>

01:45:48.384 --> 01:45:51.354
<i>This will be goodbye</i>

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:55.729
<i>Don't call me, call me again</i>

01:45:55.808 --> 01:46:00.029
<i>I'm sorry you want me here</i>

01:46:00.104 --> 01:46:03.574
<i>But this is the end</i>

01:46:05.609 --> 01:46:12.117
<i>I want to explain how bad I fee!</i>

01:46:13.909 --> 01:46:17.379
<i>The words, they won't come</i>

01:46:17.454 --> 01:46:20.754
<i>But I wish they will</i>

01:46:22.293 --> 01:46:26.014
<i>All I can say</i>

01:46:26.088 --> 01:46:30.013
<i>Is I'm sorry and I hope we're not done</i>

01:46:30.092 --> 01:46:33.687
<i>Son, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry</i>

01:46:33.762 --> 01:46:38.233
<i>Oh, so sorry, son</i>

01:46:40.519 --> 01:46:43.989
<i>I don't want you to live your life</i>

01:46:44.648 --> 01:46:49.745
<i>Worrying about me</i>

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:52.744
<i>I've enjoyed my time</i>

01:46:53.407 --> 01:46:56.957
<i>Soon I'll be free</i>

01:46:57.953 --> 01:47:04.928
<i>You're so young with
your whole life to live</i>

01:47:06.545 --> 01:47:10.300
<i>Go in peace, my child</i>

01:47:10.382 --> 01:47:15.730
<i>To God my soul I give</i>

01:47:15.971 --> 01:47:18.850
<i>If you only knew</i>

01:47:18.933 --> 01:47:23.780
<i>How much I love you</i>

01:47:24.355 --> 01:47:31.330
<i>You wouldn't go astray
With me you'll always stay</i>

01:47:33.572 --> 01:47:40.456
<i>I don't want you to not recognize</i>

01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:48.843
<i>I don't want you out of my life</i>

01:47:50.506 --> 01:47:53.931
<i>God, please help me</i>

01:47:54.009 --> 01:47:58.355
<i>Only you can give me what I need</i>

01:47:59.264 --> 01:48:03.110
<i>I've decided to wait for you</i>

01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:07.486
<i>Down on my knees</i>

01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:14.869
<i>No more being outside of your will</i>

01:48:15.531 --> 01:48:20.162
<i>I'm gonna stay right here and wait for you</i>

01:48:20.244 --> 01:48:25.250

02:12:27.648 --> 02:12:30.777
<i>It's all about love</i>

02:13:20.868 --> 02:13:23.621
<i>I found that kid on YouTube.</i>

02:13:23.913 --> 02:13:27.634
<i>I really did. He was singing his heart out
in Craig Lewis Band.</i>

02:13:27.708 --> 02:13:31.713
<i>Zuri is in the back.
They are amazing singers.</i>

02:13:33.255 --> 02:13:35.724
<i>I am beyond blessed.</i>

02:13:35.799 --> 02:13:37.944
<i>I get to share the stage
with these people every night.</i>

02:13:37.968 --> 02:13:41.723
<i>These are some of
the most amazing singers in the world.</i>

02:13:44.558 --> 02:13:48.233
<i>On July 8th of 2012,</i>

02:13:49.271 --> 02:13:52.366
<i>next month, it'll be 20 years
that I've been doing these shows.</i>

02:13:52.441 --> 02:13:53.658
<i>Twenty years.</i>

02:13:57.404 --> 02:14:01.329
<i>Started right down the street
at the 14th Street Playhouse.</i>

02:14:01.408 --> 02:14:04.753
<i>Thought I'd see 1,200 people
and 30 showed up.</i>

02:14:05.496 --> 02:14:08.591
<i>Lost everything I had, but I had a dream.</i>

02:14:10.084 --> 02:14:14.305
<i>And I had hope and I kept pushing
and kept fighting.</i>

02:14:15.923 --> 02:14:18.426
<i>I had a million people tell me, "No."</i>

02:14:18.509 --> 02:14:20.762
<i>But I got one "Yes" from God.</i>

02:14:25.599 --> 02:14:27.852
<i>And I don't care
how many dreamers are in this room,</i>

02:14:27.935 --> 02:14:30.404
<i>I don't care how many people
have tried to stop you,</i>

02:14:30.479 --> 02:14:33.107
<i>I don't care how many people have told you,
"it's not gonna work."</i>

02:14:33.190 --> 02:14:36.694
<i>I'm a living witness that it does work.
God is good.</i>

02:14:40.739 --> 02:14:42.491
<i>In my life, all I want to do,</i>

02:14:42.575 --> 02:14:44.469
<i>the end of the song talks about
it's all about love.</i>

02:14:44.493 --> 02:14:46.245
<i>It really, truly ls all about love.</i>

02:14:46.328 --> 02:14:50.378
<i>Because all I want to do is lift us up,
encourage us, make us laugh, make us think</i>

02:14:50.457 --> 02:14:54.178
<i>and at the same time believe with some joy
and some faith and some hope.</i>

02:14:54.253 --> 02:14:57.097
<i>My mother, God rest her soul.</i>

02:14:57.172 --> 02:14:59.891
<i>I had one dream
when I started doing these shows</i>

02:14:59.967 --> 02:15:03.471
<i>and that was just to be able
to do well enough to take care of her.</i>

02:15:03.554 --> 02:15:05.615
<i>And because of people like you
all over this country,</i>

02:15:05.639 --> 02:15:08.483
<i>I was able to do that, and around
the world. So, God bless you.</i>

02:15:09.101 --> 02:15:11.149
<i>I will never forget it.</i>

02:15:12.605 --> 02:15:14.403
<i>And my prayer for you,</i>

02:15:14.523 --> 02:15:18.744
<i>is that everything you've done for me,
may it come back to you 100 fold.</i>

02:15:18.819 --> 02:15:22.323
<i>I am grateful to my mother every day.</i>

02:15:22.406 --> 02:15:26.502
<i>She didn't have a whole lotto leave me,
but she taught me about Jesus.</i>

02:15:26.577 --> 02:15:28.930
<i>And there are a lot of people in Hollywood
who believe a lot of things.</i>

02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:30.922
<i>Listen, God bless them. Let them believe...</i>

02:15:30.998 --> 02:15:34.753
<i>Listen, I don't talk about what you believe.
I respect everybody, what they believe.</i>

02:15:34.835 --> 02:15:39.807
<i>All I ask is that you respect me in what I
believe, and I believe in Jesus Christ.</i>

02:15:44.511 --> 02:15:47.685
<i>I don't make any apologies for it.
It doesn't make me perfect,</i>

02:15:47.765 --> 02:15:50.109
<i>it makes</i> me redeemed.

02:15:50.184 --> 02:15:53.063
<i>And what I try to do with everything</i>

02:15:53.145 --> 02:15:56.820
<i>is just give us all a little bit of hope,
a little bit of lifting.</i>

02:15:57.691 --> 02:15:59.614
<i>So, whatever you're going through
in your life,</i>

02:15:59.693 --> 02:16:02.321
<i>if this show has spoken to you
or anything that I've done,</i>

02:16:02.404 --> 02:16:05.123
<i>I want you to know
that it's all been by design just for you.</i>

02:16:05.449 --> 02:16:08.511
<i>All the dreamers in this room, go back
and dust your dream off if you've stopped.</i>

02:16:08.535 --> 02:16:10.972
<i>Don't let anybody stop you.
Pm telling you, if I would have given up,</i>

02:16:10.996 --> 02:16:14.296
<i>I wouldn't be sitting here
and you wouldn't be sitting there.</i>

02:16:14.375 --> 02:16:16.218
<i>It's easy to give up.</i>

02:16:16.335 --> 02:16:19.965
<i>It's easy to let go,
'cause it hurts too much to dream.</i>

02:16:20.047 --> 02:16:23.551
<i>Sometimes dreams can be tough
to keep going.</i>

02:16:23.634 --> 02:16:28.640
<i>And sometimes all you have is yourself
to encourage yourself.</i>

02:16:28.722 --> 02:16:32.066
<i>You have to rely on
and remember everything that I did.</i>

02:16:32.142 --> 02:16:34.454
<i>I had to rely and remember everything
that my mother taught me,</i>

02:16:34.477 --> 02:16:37.322
<i>everything the Bible taught me
about making it and going forth</i>

02:16:37.397 --> 02:16:40.197
<i>and God being with me and having the
faith the size of a mustard seed.</i>

02:16:40.275 --> 02:16:43.279
<i>And as I did that,
I Watched my whole life change.</i>

02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:46.536
<i>But there was a simple prayer
that she taught me that I never forgot.</i>

02:16:46.615 --> 02:16:49.552
<i>It's a simple prayer, a lot of people
say it, but they don't really mean it.</i>

02:16:49.575 --> 02:16:53.877
<i>It's a simple prayer, it says,
"God, let your will be done."</i>

02:16:53.956 --> 02:16:58.757
<i>If you can say that and really mean it,
your entire fife will change.</i>

02:16:59.002 --> 02:17:00.924
<i>Because it means that you give up control.</i>

02:17:01.004 --> 02:17:04.178
<i>It means that you give up trying
to make everything go your way.</i>

02:17:04.258 --> 02:17:08.058
<i>You let God be the wind in your sail,</i>

02:17:08.137 --> 02:17:11.437
<i>and take you to the place
where He wants you to go.</i>

02:17:11.514 --> 02:17:13.826
<i>So what I would tell you tonight,
if you're going through anything,</i>

02:17:13.851 --> 02:17:16.103
<i>worried about your children,
family, job, whatever,</i>

02:17:16.186 --> 02:17:18.359
<i>just stressing out, just let it be.</i>

02:17:19.022 --> 02:17:23.823
<i>Let it be. Do all you can, then stand.
And let it be.</i>

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:27.075
<i>God has the answer, so let it be.</i>

02:17:31.118 --> 02:17:34.668
<i>God bless you, Atlanta. I love you so much.
I'll see you really soon.</i>

02:18:09.823 --> 02:18:13.123
This is my fourth Tyler Perry play
that I'm here to see.

02:18:13.201 --> 02:18:17.753
And this is Madea <i>Gets a Job</i>
and it is crazy funny. You got to see it.

02:18:17.831 --> 02:18:20.834
- We're having a blast at this place.
- Yes.

02:18:20.918 --> 02:18:24.172
Madea got a job and the job is a hot mess.

02:18:24.879 --> 02:18:27.724
This is my first time ever
coming to anything like this,

02:18:27.841 --> 02:18:29.843
and it's been a lot of fun.

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:33.684
I've never had a chance
to see him live like this.

02:18:33.763 --> 02:18:38.361
And I'm really grateful to God
for allowing me to have this experience.

02:18:38.644 --> 02:18:44.071
We've been Tyler Perry fans forever,
since it all began, way back when.

02:18:44.148 --> 02:18:45.526
Since the beginning.

02:18:45.859 --> 02:18:47.952
We thank you
for bringing the show to Atlanta.

02:18:48.028 --> 02:18:49.450
We're just having an awesome time.

02:18:49.655 --> 02:18:52.032
This is my first Tyler Perry play ever.

02:18:52.199 --> 02:18:56.750
This is my first time
coming to the Tyler Perry show.

02:18:57.204 --> 02:18:59.298
I had a great time with my mom.

02:18:59.373 --> 02:19:00.875
I'm all the way from London.

02:19:00.958 --> 02:19:05.338
This is the first time I've got
to see a Tyler Perry show, production show.

02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:07.548
Totally excited.

02:19:07.630 --> 02:19:11.727
He needs to bring it over to London,
I'm sure many people would want to see it.

02:19:11.802 --> 02:19:14.430
I'm the biggest fan.
I have every single last DVD.

02:19:14.513 --> 02:19:16.031
And of course, I'm getting this one, too.

02:19:16.056 --> 02:19:18.808
Uncut. Uncensored. So that's great.

02:19:18.892 --> 02:19:20.064
He's hilarious.

02:19:20.434 --> 02:19:23.314
We drove all the way over here
from South Haven, Michigan to see him.

02:19:23.397 --> 02:19:25.991
And I think the best part for me was
when she told Allen

02:19:26.066 --> 02:19:29.570
it looked like he combed his beard up
to cover up the bald spot on his head.

02:19:29.861 --> 02:19:33.036
I've been a Tyler Perry
fan for six years now.

02:19:33.115 --> 02:19:34.759
I drove all the way
from Knoxville, Tennessee,

02:19:34.782 --> 02:19:36.285
just to come see it here in Atlanta.

02:19:36.785 --> 02:19:40.039
This is my fourth play, actually,
and I cannot wait to see more.

02:19:40.121 --> 02:19:42.716
I'm so excited. And it's been funny so far.

02:19:42.790 --> 02:19:44.134
You think that old lady funny?

02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:46.632
- I think she is hilarious.
- She's crazy.

02:19:47.421 --> 02:19:51.676
- It was very funny, it was
very exciting... Motivational.

02:19:51.758 --> 02:19:53.681
We should really come back.

02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:54.977
- We really should.
- Yeah.

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:56.225
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

02:19:56.305 --> 02:20:00.481
Tyler Perry had me in stitches.
I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.

02:20:00.559 --> 02:20:02.482
His messages are so inspirational.

02:20:02.936 --> 02:20:06.531
I done cried and laughed,
all at the same time, already. Love it.

02:20:06.899 --> 02:20:10.073
It's really uplifting,
it was inspirational.

02:20:10.319 --> 02:20:11.796
Keep on doing what you're doing, brother.

02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:14.448
Because a lot of people in this world
really need a little fix.

02:20:14.573 --> 02:20:17.326
I had to bring her.
I've been to every Tyler Perry show.

02:20:17.409 --> 02:20:19.036
This was one of the best ones.

02:20:19.286 --> 02:20:21.789
The concept was awesome,
everything was the bomb.

02:20:21.872 --> 02:20:23.249
I love Tyler Perry. He rocks!

02:20:23.457 --> 02:20:25.130
- The singing...
- Great.

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:27.218
I love all the singers.
They sound really good.

02:20:27.294 --> 02:20:29.672
Yeah, singers, that was...

02:20:29.755 --> 02:20:31.803
- Yes.
- I can hit those notes, too.

02:20:33.634 --> 02:20:35.636
- Tyler can sing.
- I know.

02:20:36.929 --> 02:20:39.478
He can not only sing, he can sing.

02:20:39.890 --> 02:20:42.985
I think I saw a little Harlem shaking
going on in that singing just now.

02:20:43.185 --> 02:20:45.187
Thank you, Mr. Perry.

02:20:45.312 --> 02:20:48.532
Tyler Perry, once again, you have showed
up and showed out all this...

02:20:48.607 --> 02:20:50.484
- Yes, great one. Great job!
- Great job!

02:20:50.692 --> 02:20:52.772
Awesome, phenomenal job, man.
Keep it going, brother.

02:20:52.819 --> 02:20:55.197
- We love you, Tyler Perry.
- Love you.

02:20:55.489 --> 02:20:58.369
- Awesome. Tyler Perry, we love you.
- Awesome. Tyler Perry, we love you.

02:20:58.450 --> 02:21:00.623
Thank you, praise God.

02:21:00.702 --> 02:21:02.579
We enjoyed it, it was so much fun.

02:21:02.788 --> 02:21:03.914
Great job, Tyler.

02:21:04.081 --> 02:21:05.628
Hey, Tyler, we love you!

02:21:05.832 --> 02:21:07.379
- I love you, Tyler!
- Love you!
