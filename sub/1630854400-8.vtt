- Hey.

I just got up myself.

00:13.638 --> 00:14.889
- Yeah, you look like
you've been there

00:14.931 --> 00:16.099
all night since we talked.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.559
- I didn't want to miss
anything else.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.769
I'm really not looking forward
to reading the part

00:19.811 --> 00:22.022
in my article where I write
about sleeping soundly

00:22.063 --> 00:24.607
while you and the Prime
Minister became fast friends.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.693
- Well, you missed way more
than us becoming fast friends

00:26.735 --> 00:28.945
because she agreed to hear me
out on the coffee trade deal.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.238
Said we'd get into it today.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.699
- Maybe I'm not cut out
for hard journalism.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.908
Maybe I belong at a desk

00:33.950 --> 00:35.827
talking to a French Bulldog
named Cheese.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.162
- Who?
- Oh, come on.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.204
You really don't watch my show?

00:38.246 --> 00:39.622
Why would I lie about that?

00:39.664 --> 00:43.001
- Dwayne, I am so sorry,
but I'm afraid our coffee talk

00:43.043 --> 00:44.794
is going to have to wait
for a later time.

- <i>Respect our choice!</i>
- Why are they protesting?

00:51.843 --> 00:54.804
- We held a public vote
to rename the tallest mountain

00:54.846 --> 00:58.016
in Gjelgjiughm, which was
called Cannibal's Peak

00:58.058 --> 01:00.101
due to a gruesome tragedy

01:00.143 --> 01:02.228
that involved
our national soccer team

01:02.270 --> 01:04.564
after a team building hike
went awry.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.025
- Wow. Yeah, I would
change that name too.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.401
Which is what we tried to do.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.987
We took submissions from
our citizens for a few names

01:11.029 --> 01:12.447
and then we put them to a vote.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.116
Well, now, the vote is over,

01:15.158 --> 01:17.869
and apparently the people
are angry with me

01:17.911 --> 01:20.789
for not ratifying their choice
for the new name.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.665
- Which is?
- "Billy, Will You Go

01:22.707 --> 01:25.251
To the Dance With Me,
It's Maria Mountain."

01:25.293 --> 01:27.379
It was submitted by
an 11-year-old,

01:27.420 --> 01:29.464
and it won by a landslide.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.008
I'm supposed to look out
for the people, right?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.760
And make the calls that are

01:33.802 --> 01:36.137
sometimes too tough for them
to make on their own.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.848
- Mm. I struggled
in my relationship

01:38.890 --> 01:40.100
with the public too,

01:40.141 --> 01:41.601
especially earlier on
in my career

01:41.643 --> 01:43.520
when The Rock
became a household name.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.271
<i>At first, things were great.</i>

01:45.313 --> 01:46.773

01:46.815 --> 01:48.608
<i>and my popularity</i>
<i>was skyrocketing,</i>

01:48.650 --> 01:50.527
<i>so Vince used</i>
<i>my growing stature</i>

01:50.568 --> 01:53.029
<i>to create a little unrest</i>
<i>in the Nation of Domination.</i>

01:53.071 --> 01:54.739
The Rock feels like this,
Farooq.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.867
You are the greatest thing
since an egg white omelet,

01:57.909 --> 01:59.452
so The Rock offers you this.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.956
<i>See, I had just bought my</i>
<i>fellow Nation members Rolexes,</i>

02:02.997 --> 02:05.709

<i>for Farooq.</i>

The locker room can be

03:53.525 --> 03:54.776
a viper's nest

These guys have been great.

It's because vipers

04:01.533 --> 04:03.618

08:33.471 --> 08:34.806
Hey, hang in there, Chad.

08:34.848 --> 08:38.018
Ah, I'll be all right. Hey.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.478
- Keep killing it, bro.
- I appreciate that, brother.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.522
You got it.

08:42.564 --> 08:43.940
- [sighs]
That's rough.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.443
- Chad is a class act.
- Yeah. Totally.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.611
But Chad Frost and Stone Cold

08:48.653 --> 08:50.363
are the company's
two biggest stars.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.033
With him out, that's a big hole
at the top of the card.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.869
Vince is gonna be looking for
somebody to fill it.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.043
- I wanna be that guy.
What do we have to do?

09:03.084 --> 09:06.296
- Show out. Impress Vince.
Make the choice undeniable.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.922
<i>- Though Farooq</i>
<i>had warned me,</i>

09:13.178 --> 09:15.972
[mellow chords]

09:16.014 --> 09:16.973
<i>- I was already fully</i>
<i>The Rock.</i>

09:17.974 --> 09:20.852
* The Rock says
that Cleveland *

09:20.894 --> 09:23.772
* Is totally lame *
[crowd boos]

09:23.813 --> 09:26.900
<i>And with Brian's help,</i>
<i>I dialed it up to 11.</i>

09:26.941 --> 09:28.943
* Hall of fame *

09:28.985 --> 09:32.906
* The Rock has to say,
"Aw, shucks" *

09:32.947 --> 09:35.116
<i>We drew upon my love of</i>
<i>country music.</i>

09:35.158 --> 09:37.535
* 'Cause Cleveland
doesn't rock *

09:37.577 --> 09:39.913
* No, it totally sucks *

09:39.954 --> 09:42.457
[laughs]
[crowd booing]

09:42.499 --> 09:45.335
<i>I tested the limits of what</i>
<i>a heel could get away with.</i>

09:45.377 --> 09:48.171
Timmy, what a treat it is
for you to be here.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.881
Tell The Rock
how it makes you feel.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.466
- It makes me...
- It doesn't matter

09:51.508 --> 09:52.967
how it makes you feel.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.053
- [crowd booing]
<i>- [crying]</i>

09:55.095 --> 09:57.097
<i>- And then there were</i>
<i>the catchphrases.</i>

09:57.138 --> 09:59.933
<i>A lotta guys had one,</i>
<i>maybe two big lines.</i>

09:59.974 --> 10:01.976
<i>But I thought,</i>
<i>"Why limit myself?"</i>

10:02.018 --> 10:05.772
A roody-poo candy ass.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.357
Finally...

10:07.399 --> 10:10.276
- all: The rock has come back...
- The Rock has come back

10:10.318 --> 10:11.820
to Memphis.

10:11.861 --> 10:15.115
Know your role
and shut your mouth.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.992
In front of the millions...
all: And millions.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.994
- And millions
of The Rock's fans.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.123
If you smell-l-l-l-l ow

10:23.164 --> 10:26.001
what The Rock is cooking.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.879
[cheers and applause]

10:31.339 --> 10:33.925
Dwayne, you went heavy again.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.760
I don't love it
when people mess with

10:35.802 --> 10:38.346
the timing of the show.
Throws everything outta whack.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.098
- Of course. I'll work on it.
- Good.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.393
You know, SummerSlam's
just around the corner.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.769
I'm thinking about
putting you up

10:44.811 --> 10:46.855
against Triple H
in a ladder match.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.356
- You serious?
- Yeah.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.192
You would be the match
before the main event.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.570
Stone Cold had that slot
at last year's SummerSlam.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.239
This year,
he headlined WrestleMania.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.199
It's amazing. Thank you.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.535
- But I can't have you
going heavy.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.412
Especially since
I been hearing things.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.206
- Hearing things?
What things?

11:05.248 --> 11:07.375
- Don't worry about it.
It's not important.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.878
This a big moment.
Lotta eyeballs on you.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.254
I want to make sure
you can handle

11:11.296 --> 11:13.381
that kind of spotlight
the way I need you to.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.717
Can't have you getting
a big head, you know?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.927
Right. Big head.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.388
<i>Turns out the vipers</i>
<i>weren't trying to poison me.</i>

11:20.430 --> 11:22.223
<i>They were poisoning Vince.</i>

11:22.265 --> 11:24.934
<i>So I went to</i>
<i>confront the snake.</i>

11:27.479 --> 11:29.397
- Just got off the phone
with my wife.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.441
Corn worms got to
my tomato plants again.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.193
- Moths ate
one of my turtlenecks.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.694
Hunter, let's talk.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.447
Ooh, am I in trouble?

11:37.489 --> 11:39.157
[laughs]

11:39.199 --> 11:40.742
- So that's how you're gonna
play it, huh?

11:40.784 --> 11:43.661
- Come after my big head.
- What are you talking about?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.997
- You can't handle the heat
in the ring, so you go off

11:46.039 --> 11:48.083
and tattle to Daddy Vince
behind my back?

11:48.124 --> 11:50.126
- Whoa, I didn't tattle
about nothing to nobody,

11:50.168 --> 11:52.087
especially not to Vince.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.130
You need to get
your story straight.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.011
- Man, Triple H denied
the whole thing.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.429
- What whole thing?
- He was the one

12:01.471 --> 12:03.306
who trash talked me to Vince
behind my back.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.809
Told him I had a big head
or something like that,

12:05.850 --> 12:08.395
which is true technically,
but it's proportionally right

12:08.436 --> 12:09.979
- for my body.
- It wasn't him.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.524
I know because I was there
when it happened.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.693
- Look, all I'm sayin'
is Rock ain't ready.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.569
I mean, he thinks
he's better than everybody.

12:16.611 --> 12:17.904
The guys don't trust him.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.573
I just don't know if
he can handle the top spot.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.200
- I appreciate you
telling me this.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.119
It matters to me
what my best guys think.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.122
<i>[edgy music]</i>

12:27.163 --> 12:29.082
<i>* *</i>

12:29.124 --> 12:30.750
- I'm so much smaller
than all the guys,

12:30.792 --> 12:32.127
people just forget I'm there.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.336
<i>I get it now.</i>

12:33.378 --> 12:35.046
<i>Chad Frost</i>
<i>wasn't a real wrestler.</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:36.589
- <i>It's a pseudonym.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

12:36.631 --> 12:38.466
<i>That guy never turned out</i>
<i>to be a friend,</i>

12:38.508 --> 12:39.843
<i>and I'll just leave it there.</i>

12:39.884 --> 12:41.302
<i>Oh, my wrestling blogs,</i>

12:41.344 --> 12:42.762
<i>they are gonna be</i>
<i>blowing up</i>

<i>true identity.</i>

12:44.681 --> 12:45.890
[sighs]

12:45.932 --> 12:48.018
Chad Frost smiled at me,

12:48.059 --> 12:49.352
shook my hand,
looked me in the eye,

12:49.394 --> 12:50.687
and he still did that?

12:50.729 --> 12:51.938
- Yeah, I couldn't
believe it either.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.316
- Dad was right.
Viper's nest.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.235
I told you. Tell him.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.404
- Cobra's den.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:59.446 --> 13:00.655
And now I have a ladder match

13:00.697 --> 13:02.657
with a guy I just chewed out
for no reason.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.576
How am I supposed to
show Vince I'm the guy

13:04.617 --> 13:06.411
when I'm working with someone
who doesn't trust me?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.455
You got great instincts,

13:08.496 --> 13:10.832
but the guys need to know
once you get in the ring

13:10.874 --> 13:13.668
and follow your gut that you're
gonna take 'em with you.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.588
<i>You do that,</i>
<i>you'll earn his trust.</i>

13:16.629 --> 13:21.134

<i>who've never seen</i>
<i>a ladder match:</i>

<i>No pinfalls</i>
<i>or submissions.</i>

13:59.798 --> 14:03.259
<i>The Intercontinental belt will</i>
<i>be attached to that apparatus.</i>

<i>They'll defend it</i>
<i>over the ring.</i>

<i>Only way to reach it</i>
<i>is on the ladder.</i>

14:07.639 --> 14:10.725
<i>And of course, the first man</i>
<i>to reach the belt</i>

14:10.767 --> 14:11.976
<i>is the winner.</i>

- All right.

Okay, ring the bell.
Let's go.

<i>What's he gonna do now?</i>

18:58.596 --> 19:01.766
- <i>Helmsley is looking for gold.</i>
<i>- Get up, Rock!</i>

19:01.808 --> 19:03.852
<i>Get up, Rock!</i>
<i>He got it!</i>

19:03.893 --> 19:06.229
<i>- Yes! He did it.</i>
[bell rings]

19:06.271 --> 19:08.398
<i>He did it.</i>
<i>Triple H did it.</i>

19:08.440 --> 19:12.485
<i>[Triple H's theme song]</i>

19:12.527 --> 19:14.779
<i>Triple H.</i>

19:14.821 --> 19:19.034
<i>- Wow, what an effort</i>
<i>by both men.</i>

19:19.075 --> 19:22.829
<i>But Triple H did it</i>
<i>on one bad knee.</i>

19:22.871 --> 19:26.041
- [sighs]
Hey.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.168
Do me a favor.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.711
Milk the exit.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.796
I'm gonna lay here
for a minute.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.340
- Thanks for the direction,
Spielberg.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.883
[chuckles]

19:34.924 --> 19:36.593
<i>Even though I had</i>
<i>won Triple H over</i>

19:36.634 --> 19:38.303
<i>and gone heavy with the time,</i>

19:38.345 --> 19:41.348
<i>my gut was telling me</i>
<i>just lay there in defeat.</i>

19:42.140 --> 19:45.185
<i>Then something incredible</i>
<i>happened.</i>

19:45.226 --> 19:47.145
<i>The fans felt for me.</i>

19:47.187 --> 19:51.399
[all chanting "Rocky]

19:51.441 --> 19:54.486
<i>- They started chanting my</i>
<i>name like I was a baby face.</i>

19:54.527 --> 19:57.864
chanting: Rocky, Rocky,
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky!

19:57.906 --> 20:00.492
<i>That was a moment</i>
<i>I will never forget.</i>

20:03.578 --> 20:05.497
- What the hell
are you doing out there?

20:05.538 --> 20:09.501
20 minutes
means 20 damn minutes.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.462
- Get Stone Cold and Taker
going.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.007
- I'm sorry for
going heavy, boss.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.509
I know what
you're going to say...

20:17.550 --> 20:19.928
- Dwayne, that...
[sighs]

20:19.969 --> 20:21.680
Was awesome.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.223
<i>- I proved to Vince</i>
<i>that I could be</i>

20:23.264 --> 20:25.141
<i>the WWF's next big star,</i>

20:25.183 --> 20:28.144
<i>side-by-side with Austin,</i>
<i>but that match also showed</i>

20:28.186 --> 20:29.604
<i>me and Vince something else.</i>

20:29.646 --> 20:31.940
<i>The fans were ready for</i>
<i>The Rock to turn baby face,</i>

20:31.981 --> 20:33.733
<i>and that turn would kickstart</i>

20:33.775 --> 20:36.069
<i>the next epic phase</i>
<i>of my career.</i>

20:36.111 --> 20:38.363
Now, everyone's gonna
have their opinion on

20:38.405 --> 20:39.739
how I should operate.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.408
But staying true to myself,

20:41.449 --> 20:42.992
even if it means
ruffling some feathers,

20:43.034 --> 20:45.370
has always been
the key to my success.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.871
You trusted your gut.

20:46.913 --> 20:50.333
- Yes, exactly, and it's always
paid off for me.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.712
- I can't let them
name that mountain.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.172
- There you go.
Your gut has spoken.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.549
- [chuckles]
Okay.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.551
Well, if you will excuse me,

20:59.592 --> 21:01.761
I need to go
and draft a statement.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.471
- Sounds good.
- Thank you, Dwayne.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.181
- Any time, Prime Minister.
- Okay.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.933
- Any time.
- All right

21:09.185 --> 21:10.603
That was nice.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.731
I thought you might bring up
the trade deal at the end.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.399
Nah, it didn't feel right.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.026
I got to listen to my gut.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.153
The opportunity
will present itself.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.530
Hey, watch out for
the grass crabs around here.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.449
- They love an exposed ankle.
- Oh.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.912
[phone chimes]

21:27.954 --> 21:31.666
I stood on the lawn
worried about grass crabs.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.585
How did I get here?
[phone chimes]

21:33.626 --> 21:35.462
Uh, play Talking Heads.
