WEBVTT

02:46.375 --> 02:48.334
Can I sit here?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.133
If you feel like it.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.686
Someone barfed there, fourth period.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.961
Hi, Dawn. Sorry to bother you.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.380
We were just wondering,
are you a lesbian?

03:39.511 --> 03:42.305
-Well, are you?
-No.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.723
Liar.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.933
She made a pass at me.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.189
Lesbo, lesbo, lesbo.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.070
You little faggot!

04:04.036 --> 04:07.163
Fucking faggot.
You're a faggot, aren't you?

04:07.331 --> 04:09.123
- Aren't you?
- No.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.709
- "I'm a faggot." Admit it.
- No.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.461
"I'm a faggot."

04:13.629 --> 04:15.963
You look beautiful in this suit, Troy.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.382
-Get over here.
-Don't you?

04:18.550 --> 04:21.969
You fucking faggot.
You're a faggot, aren't you, Troy boy?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.846
- Aren't you?
- No!

04:24.014 --> 04:26.307
Admit it. Say, "I'm a faggot."

04:26.475 --> 04:27.642
- Say it.
- No!

04:27.809 --> 04:29.977
- Say it, faggot. Say it!
- No!

04:30.145 --> 04:32.521
-I'm a faggot.
-Leave him alone.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.233
Hey, guys, watch out.
It's the Wiener dog!

04:35.400 --> 04:37.026
It's dog-face over here.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.070
You guys are such jerks.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.740
What's the matter, ugly?
You like faggots?

04:45.244 --> 04:48.204
Let's get out of here.
Her face is killing me.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.042
Are you all right, Troy?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.503
Leave me alone, Wiener dog.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.954
Hey, that didn't sound too much
like "Satisfaction."

05:30.122 --> 05:33.082
-What's the matter?
-I don't know. It says B-flat.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.585
-I'm just playing what it says.
-Play me an A.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.050
-This is bad.
-We sound like shit.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.428
I knew this band idea was gonna suck.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.722
What does "suck" mean?

05:47.889 --> 05:50.141
Missy, go play with Dawn.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.770
We've gotta practice more.
It's our first time.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.732
What do you think
the Stones sounded like their first time?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.150
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.570
I'm gonna close the garage door
so we can get privacy.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.114
Okay, let's take it from the top.

06:05.741 --> 06:09.368
One, and a two,
and a one, two, three, four.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.087
Toss-up question:
spell the word "satellite."

06:21.840 --> 06:25.259
S-A-T-E-L-L-I-T-E.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.595
Correct. You got 20 points
in that bonus.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.805
You're not supposed to drink
in the TV room.

06:29.973 --> 06:34.018
-Drop dead, lesbo.
-Riverdale has 200. Toss-up.

06:34.186 --> 06:37.438
- London, England is located....
- Mommy, Dawn called me "lesbo."

06:37.606 --> 06:39.648
- Hold on, Rita.
- The Thames.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.777
- Oh, Dawn.
- Now, for 10 points....

06:42.944 --> 06:45.988
Dawn, I want to speak to you right now.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.656
- Stupid.
- Purple Heart.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.117
Correct. Name two features
of the Purple Heart.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.161
Tattletale.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.916
- What did you call her?
- She was bothering me!

06:57.084 --> 06:59.835
I don't care.
Now, are you going to apologize?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.421
- No!
- Apologize or you're punished.

07:02.589 --> 07:06.050
- But she was bothering me!
- No! That's it! Go to your room!

07:06.218 --> 07:08.844
- She's such a little brat!
- I don't want to hear it! Go!

07:09.012 --> 07:10.346
- Little moron!
- Go!

07:12.265 --> 07:13.557
American Revolution.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.893
That's correct. You got all 40 points.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.187
Toss-up: what organism is the--?

07:18.355 --> 07:21.190
- Color of the dress.
- I never would have guessed.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.983
Right. Isn't that neat?

07:23.151 --> 07:26.153
- I love her little profile.
- Let's go to the phones.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.284
Hi, Missy. Is Dawn home?

07:32.452 --> 07:35.663
Yeah, but she can't play. She's punished.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.626
Stop it.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.678
-Mrs. Grissom?
-Yes, Dawn.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.222
Brandon's trying to copy my answers.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.599
You lie.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.684
You were too, and you know it.

08:40.103 --> 08:41.520
Quiet!

08:42.981 --> 08:46.358
Dawn, Brandon,
you can see me here at 3.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.820
I'm giving you both detention.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.120
Oh, hi.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.344
You didn't come in here
to wash your hands.

09:13.512 --> 09:17.806
-Yes, I did.
-You came in here to take a shit.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.851
No. Really. I don't have to go.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.938
-My hands were just dirty, that's all.
-Liar.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.690
I can smell you from here.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.695
-Please let me go.
-First...

09:31.863 --> 09:33.322
...take a shit.

09:34.199 --> 09:39.328
-But I'll be late for science.
-Well, you're not leaving until you do.

09:39.496 --> 09:44.124
You know, Lolita, me and my neighbor
are starting this new club.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.336
And if you want,
you can be vice president.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.506
Fuck you.

09:50.674 --> 09:54.385
And I really wasn't the one
who was cheating. I'm innocent.

09:54.553 --> 09:55.844
I know.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.430
You're always innocent.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.308
And Brandon's always guilty.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.353
-But Brandon was--
-You stay away from Brandon.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.854
He's mine.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.147
Got it?

10:07.315 --> 10:09.775
-Of course, but--
-"But" shit.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.819
Now...

10:11.987 --> 10:13.696
...go on.

10:16.491 --> 10:20.077
Leave it. I want to make sure you shit.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.205
I want to see it with my own eyes.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.165
Why do you hate me?

10:25.709 --> 10:28.502
Because you're ugly.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.203
Fuck you. Fuck you.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.565
Mrs. Grissom, I'm finished.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.400
Let me see.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.708
Fuck you. Fuck you.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.469
-Mrs. Grissom, can I take a retest?
-No.

12:00.637 --> 12:05.265
I know I could have done better if none
of this had happened. I was nervous.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.267
I said, no, Dawn.

12:07.727 --> 12:12.064
But, Mrs. Grissom, I really wasn't
the one who was cheating.

12:12.232 --> 12:18.195
And if I could just redo this test,
just once. Please?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.281
I'm better than a D-minus.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.200
Stop grade grubbing.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.993
Don't you have any dignity?

12:26.162 --> 12:30.249
Now, I want you
to write a 100-word essay...

12:30.417 --> 12:32.292
...on the subject of dignity...

12:32.460 --> 12:34.962
...and hand it in to me by Friday.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.256
You're excused.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.699
She's got it so easy.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.161
She'll always have it easy.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.498
Maybe she'll die.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.919
You don't know what it's like.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.337
What?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.757
Junior high.

13:20.800 --> 13:25.471
-Do you think anyone will join our club?
-I don't want anyone to join.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.475
I wanna be popular.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.231
I may have swung a good deal
with Steve Rodgers today.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.984
-I think we got him.
-Who's Steve Rodgers?

13:39.152 --> 13:43.197
Well, Steve Rodgers is only one
of the most popular guys in class.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.991
We get him, we'll get to play everywhere.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.327
Sweet 16s, school dances.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.370
Maybe even a gig on the road.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.875
-What instrument does he play?
-Guitar, a little, but mainly he sings.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.669
But that's not the point. The point is...

13:57.837 --> 14:01.048
...this is exactly what I needed
for my college résumé.

14:01.216 --> 14:05.427
With this substantial extracurricular
activity, I'm gonna have it made.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.930
Maybe not the Big Three, but an Ivy.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.140
- We'll see about the SATs.
- Fuck you.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.976
Mommy, can I join Mark's band?

14:13.144 --> 14:14.812
Oh, sweetheart. Ha-ha-ha.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.190
I'm serious. And you should send Dawn
to a reformatory.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.151
She's always bothering me.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.278
Honey, you don't mean that.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.822
Dawn loves you.

14:24.989 --> 14:28.784
Remember, no matter what she does,
she's your sister.

14:29.410 --> 14:33.997
Dawn, tell Missy that you're sorry
for bothering her and that you love her.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.129
-Dawn.
-I'm not sorry.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.714
Stop acting like a baby.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.634
You're her older sister.
And Missy loves you.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.594
- She does not.
- She does.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.389
-Tell her that you love her.
-I love you.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.140
-You do not.
-I do too.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.517
-You do not!
-Dawn!

14:53.685 --> 14:57.688
You are not leaving until you tell
your sister that you love her.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.667
Go to bed.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.761

"Dignity. Dignity is an important quality
everyone should have."

17:34.929 --> 17:36.263
Louder.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.890
"That way, you will never grade grub.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.435
Grade grubbing is bad."

17:42.478 --> 17:44.021
I said, louder.

17:44.188 --> 17:48.191
"Because it means you're asking
for a grade you shouldn't get.

17:48.359 --> 17:52.070
If you got it, it wouldn't be fair
to everyone who didn't grade grub."

17:52.238 --> 17:54.072
We can't hear you!

17:54.240 --> 17:58.785
"It doesn't matter whether you're a girl
or a boy, a man or a child...

17:58.953 --> 18:02.372
...rich or poor, fat or thin.

18:02.957 --> 18:07.002
You-- You should never be
a grade grubber.

18:07.503 --> 18:11.506
Therefore, dignity is a good quality
everyone should have."

18:19.265 --> 18:20.766
Thank you.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.312
I am here to talk to you today...

18:25.480 --> 18:28.940
...about the dangers
of talking to strangers.

18:29.650 --> 18:34.613
For I, Mary Ellen Moriarty,
once talked to strangers.

18:35.281 --> 18:39.659
And that is how I became the innocent
victim of a brutal kidnapping.

18:40.495 --> 18:44.164
Almost one year ago,
I was a carefree teenager...

18:44.332 --> 18:48.752
...memorizing my lines for Hel/o, Dolly!--
I was supposed to play Dolly.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.046
--when one day...

18:51.214 --> 18:53.799
...a day that I will never forget...

18:54.759 --> 18:56.968
...I was walking home from rehearsal.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.137
I'd missed my car pool.

18:59.847 --> 19:03.642
And I was waiting at the street corner
for the light to change.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.978
When all of a sudden...

19:07.522 --> 19:09.606
...a dark car pulled up beside me.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.361
And a big man stepped out.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.488
And he was older.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.616
And he was good-looking.

19:19.784 --> 19:20.867
And, um--

19:22.745 --> 19:25.080
And he had a tattoo on his chest.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.625
And then the next thing I know, he, um--

19:30.545 --> 19:33.171
-So, students, I'm telling you this story--
-Aah!

19:35.925 --> 19:39.219
Now, what exactly did you do, Dawn?

19:43.141 --> 19:44.516
Dawn.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.394
I shot a spitball.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.813
Speak up. I can't hear you.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.857
I shot a spitball.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.234
-You shot a what?
-She shot a spitball.

19:54.402 --> 19:57.445
-A teacher was almost blinded.
-I was fighting back.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.781
-Whoever told you to fight back?
-Ugh.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.620
Dawn, are you having social problems?

20:05.788 --> 20:08.456
-No.
-Yes. She's got no friends.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.542
-I've got friends.
-Who?

20:12.128 --> 20:13.336
Ralphy.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.132
Case closed.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.426
She's a loner.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.889
Dawn, let me put it to you straight:
we're not here to get you.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.393
But you've got to understand,
you're in junior high now.

20:28.561 --> 20:32.230
This goes in the computer
on your record.

20:32.982 --> 20:37.986
Another couple of years, and this kind of
incident goes on your college transcript.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.405
Any questions?

21:09.185 --> 21:12.687
-Were you playing with my dolls?
-No.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.278
Stupid....

21:30.790 --> 21:33.625
-Hey.
-Hey, how's it going?

21:33.793 --> 21:34.876
Okay.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.379
How come you got here so late?

21:37.755 --> 21:40.465
I don't know. Am I late?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.260
Well, never mind. Come on in.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.651
-That your computer-science notebook?
-What?

21:59.819 --> 22:02.570
-Is that your computer-science notebook?
-Yeah.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.197
Oh, hey. Are you Mark's sister?

22:46.657 --> 22:48.283
Yeah.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.206
-You in junior high?
-Yeah.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.629
-Ben Frank?
-Yeah.

23:02.923 --> 23:03.965
You like it?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.509
No.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.805
Yeah, Ben Frank's pretty bad.

23:10.973 --> 23:13.641
-You went there too?
-Oh, yeah.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.894
-I was almost expelled.
-Really?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.979
Why?

23:19.732 --> 23:20.815
I hated it.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.693
Oh, God, me too.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.782
Don't worry. It's only three years.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.746
Steve.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.290
Out.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.464
- So did you get started on the chapter?
- No.

23:44.632 --> 23:48.093
It's real important to focus on it
if you want to....

24:00.147 --> 24:04.359
Dear Mark, I thought long and
hard over what we discussed at camp...

24:04.527 --> 24:07.904
...and talked about it with my mother.
She agrees with me.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.032
Sex is an important thing
to experiment with before marriage...

24:11.200 --> 24:14.661
...but only if there is
a serious commitment on both ends.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.329
This is my third letter to you.

24:16.497 --> 24:19.666
I'm going to assume you do not want
to continue our relationship...

24:19.834 --> 24:23.169
...if I do not hear back from you
within 10 days.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.923
Sincerely, your ex-girlfriend?

24:27.091 --> 24:29.342
Naomi Hayes Blatt.

24:29.510 --> 24:32.846
P.S. I'm getting hooked up to e-mail
for my birthday.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.599
I'll let you know my address
as soon as it happens.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.561
Mark?

24:39.728 --> 24:40.979
Yeah?

24:41.147 --> 24:44.357
-What are you doing?
-Computer science.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.574
Is Steve good at computer science?

24:53.868 --> 24:57.036
He's fair. He's in the bottom quarter
of the class...

24:57.204 --> 25:00.874
-...but he doesn't fail or anything.
-Why do you think that is?

25:01.041 --> 25:04.502
It's simple. He's lazy.
All he ever thinks about is girls.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.758
Do you think about girls?

25:11.510 --> 25:14.762
What, are you kidding?
I want to get into a good school.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.890
My future's, like, important.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.768
And besides, none of the girls
at school are that pretty anyway.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.687
What about Maria Esposito?

25:23.772 --> 25:25.440
Gross.

25:26.358 --> 25:30.278
-Steve went out with her once, didn't he?
-Well, Steve is horny.

25:31.113 --> 25:32.780
Really?

25:36.118 --> 25:37.619
How horny?

25:38.078 --> 25:41.664
He'd go out with anyone
as long as it was a girl and willing.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.167
Willing to what exactly?

25:44.335 --> 25:46.044
Go all the way.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.631
You mean, have intercourse?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.633
Duh.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.468
Huh.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.804
Why? Are you in love with him
or something?

25:56.972 --> 25:58.681
-No.
-Heh.

25:58.849 --> 26:03.144
But, Mark, when you say
he'd go out with any girl...

26:03.312 --> 26:05.813
...as long as they're willing
to go all the way...

26:05.981 --> 26:08.274
...does that mean they have to be pretty?

26:10.653 --> 26:13.071
You know Tammy Steinfeld
from car pool?

26:13.239 --> 26:16.324
-Yeah.
-Okay, do you think she's pretty?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.701
Not that pretty, really.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.746
Dawn, she's a dog.
And he did it with her.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.291
Has he ever done it
with anyone younger than high school?

26:25.918 --> 26:28.962
-You know Ginger Friedman?
-She was in my gym class.

26:29.129 --> 26:32.215

-My brother.

27:30.232 --> 27:32.442
-Who's your brother?
-Mark Wiener.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.527
Him? He's king of the nerds.

27:34.695 --> 27:38.573
I know, but he told me you used
to go out with Steve. Is it true?

27:39.074 --> 27:43.328
We finger-fucked once last spring.
That's it. It's all over now.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.121
What else?

27:46.874 --> 27:51.919
I was wondering if I might have the chance
if he wanted to go steady with me.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.088
-Not a chance.
-But--

27:54.757 --> 27:58.301
Sorry, Dawn, but that's just the way it is.
You don't cut it.

27:58.886 --> 28:02.972
-What if I wore something?
-Dawn, look in the mirror.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.860
We finger-fucked once last spring.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.946
That's it. It's all over now.

28:24.578 --> 28:28.039
- What are you doing in there?
- None of your business!

28:55.192 --> 28:56.776
Hey, is Mark around?

28:56.944 --> 29:00.488
No. My mom took him shopping.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.865
Shit.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.744
He'll be back real soon though,
I'm pretty sure.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.830
You can come inside and wait.

29:10.332 --> 29:13.501
-Okay. You have anything to eat?
-Yeah. Follow me.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.257
You like Yodels?

29:19.425 --> 29:21.509
Yeah, sure. What else you got?

29:21.677 --> 29:24.470
Ring Dings, Pop-Tarts, Hawaiian Punch,
whatever you want.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.265
We've got some leftovers, too,
in the fridge.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.810
-Yeah? Like what?
-We've got some fish sticks.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.562
All right.

29:36.150 --> 29:39.610
-And I know how to make Jell-O.
-Whatever.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.493
You know, I really like your music.

29:52.374 --> 29:56.002
I'm pouring you some Hawaiian Punch.
Is that all right?

29:56.170 --> 29:57.503
Whatever.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.714
Here I come.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.852
Mm. Mm.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.680
You're not hungry?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.182
No.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.144
You know, I play the piano.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.147
Oh, yeah?

32:18.353 --> 32:20.271
Yeah, that's pretty good.

32:22.065 --> 32:25.985
I could have kept going,
but I sprained my finger yesterday.

32:26.153 --> 32:29.572
You're still better than Barry any day,
that's for sure.

32:31.241 --> 32:33.326
-You think so?
-Oh, yeah.

32:34.161 --> 32:36.537
He ought to be taking lessons from you.

32:36.705 --> 32:42.043
Yeah, well, I don't think
I have time to give lessons to Barry.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.878
But...

32:44.254 --> 32:46.714
...you want to see my fingers?

32:47.466 --> 32:49.300
Yeah, I see them.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.679
Shit.

32:54.848 --> 32:58.017
-I gotta get going.
-Please wait.

32:58.185 --> 33:02.396
Can I play it for you one more time?
This time with no mistakes. Please?

33:02.564 --> 33:04.649
- We're home!
- We're home!

33:06.944 --> 33:09.111

33:09.488 --> 33:11.614
Getting groceries
with my mom and sister.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.408
- Do you know what time it is?
- Yeah.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.203
Do you know what time
you told me to be here?

33:17.371 --> 33:19.747
-What?
-I've been waiting a half an hour.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.999
-What about the problems?
-We'll get to them.

Hey, Steve, I think your singing
was a little flat that time.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.388
Barry, why don't you play an A for Steve?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.725
You got that, Steve?

35:04.186 --> 35:05.770
Fuck this shit.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.906
What's got into him?

35:17.074 --> 35:18.824
He can't take criticism.

35:18.992 --> 35:21.077
Well, great. There goes the band.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.162
- Shit.
- Wait!

35:23.330 --> 35:24.622
Wait!

35:24.790 --> 35:27.124
-Steve!
-What do you want?

35:27.501 --> 35:29.919
-You can't just go.
-Yeah, why not?

35:30.087 --> 35:32.213
-The band needs you.
-Tough, I quit.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.466
Tell your shit-face brother
I'd rather fail computer science...

35:35.634 --> 35:38.052
...than get any more help from him.

35:55.695 --> 35:58.030
I can't believe he just quit.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.199
Well, he did...

36:00.367 --> 36:02.368
...shit-face.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.500
She's just lucky she's a girl.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.710
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.343
Dawn.

36:20.971 --> 36:24.223
Do you think I'll get
into The Hummingbirds next year?

36:24.391 --> 36:26.767
Boys always get in.

36:28.019 --> 36:31.063
Do you think they'll go on a trip
to Disney World next year?

36:31.231 --> 36:33.983
I don't know. Maybe. Depends.

36:34.151 --> 36:36.193
-On what?
-Hey, dog-face.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.654
-Drop dead.
-Let's go.

36:38.822 --> 36:42.283
What's the matter, faggot?
In a hurry to run home to Mommy?

36:42.450 --> 36:44.243
-Shut up.
-Make me, lesbo.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.911
You think you're so cool.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.581
You think you're hot shit,
but you're just cold diarrhea.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.000
-Ooh.... Listen to this faggot.
-Shut up.

36:51.168 --> 36:52.835
Shut up, you assholes.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.336
Yeah, shut up.

36:54.504 --> 36:57.089
If I were you, faggot,
I'd be shitting in my pants.

36:57.257 --> 36:59.049
When you go to junior high...

36:59.217 --> 37:02.845
...I'm gonna smash that fairy face
of yours into a mushy pulp.

37:03.013 --> 37:05.723
Yeah, well, at least
he won't stay back a year.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.894
Ha-ha-ha.
- Retard.

37:26.953 --> 37:29.330
-Hey, Wiener.
-What do you want?

37:29.497 --> 37:32.499
You better get ready
because at 3:00 today...

37:32.667 --> 37:35.044
...I'm gonna rape you.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.058
Forget that ugly bitch.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.812
Bug off.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.023
You want to come over
to my house tonight?

38:38.733 --> 38:40.943
Just get the fuck away from me, okay?

38:41.111 --> 38:43.696
Oh, come on.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.907
Get the fuck off.

39:15.937 --> 39:19.148
-Nice try, bitch.
-No, I was trying to meet you!

39:19.316 --> 39:21.567
Don't bullshit me, you piece of ugly fuck!

39:21.735 --> 39:23.944
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry for shit.

39:24.112 --> 39:27.114
-Still think I'm a retard?
-No, you're not a retard.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.158
Please stop. You're hurting me.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.454
Now strip.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.706
Strip.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.468
Bitch.

39:51.473 --> 39:55.309
Listen. When your sister gets here,
let me do most of the talking.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.394
But back me up, whatever I--

39:57.562 --> 39:59.855
Oh, Dawn. Come join us.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.025
-We need your help.
-We're having a party.

40:04.194 --> 40:06.737
-What for?
-Mom and Dad's 20th, ding-head.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.238
Mark.

40:08.406 --> 40:12.534
I was talking with your dad,
and we thought it'd be a great idea...

40:12.702 --> 40:15.996
...if, this year, we celebrated
our anniversary in the backyard.

40:16.164 --> 40:20.042
We could set up tables,
and there'd be dancing.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.211
Mark's band is gonna be the music.

40:22.379 --> 40:26.215
Your brother has even promised
to write a song special for us.

40:26.383 --> 40:28.133
It's our 20th, you know?

40:28.301 --> 40:31.887
So, what do you think?
If we all pitch in together?

40:32.680 --> 40:33.722
Okay.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.350
Mom wants you
to tear down your clubhouse.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.769
But that's the Special People Club.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.562
Oh, honey.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.981
I know.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.276
But we really need the space.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.905
And, besides,
it's not really very pretty, is it?

40:50.448 --> 40:54.034
And you're getting a little old
for clubhouses.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.207
Hello?

41:00.542 --> 41:03.293
Whom may I say is calling, please?

41:03.628 --> 41:05.337
Certainly. Hold on a moment.

41:05.505 --> 41:06.839
Dawn.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.049
It's for you.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.885
-Hello?
-Hey, ugly.

41:12.512 --> 41:14.388
Oh, hi.

41:14.556 --> 41:17.683
-Why'd you hurry off like that?
-I was in a rush.

41:17.851 --> 41:19.184
Fuck you were.

41:19.352 --> 41:20.686
-Really, I--
-Tomorrow.

41:20.854 --> 41:23.313
Same time, same place.

41:23.773 --> 41:25.357
You get raped.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.276
Be there.

41:38.872 --> 41:42.207
So who is this Brandon?

41:42.375 --> 41:44.585
Just this kid from school.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.837
Is he a nice boy?

41:47.005 --> 41:49.923
Yeah, he's okay.

42:13.281 --> 42:16.074
-You alone?
-Yeah.

42:17.368 --> 42:21.246
-What time do you have to be home by?
-Four-thirty.

42:23.208 --> 42:27.878
Wait. I have something I want you
to do for me first. Come on. This way.

42:29.464 --> 42:32.299
And don't try anything stupid.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.881
Do you want me to lie down?

43:13.049 --> 43:14.591
Okay.

43:20.723 --> 43:22.307
Wanna smoke first?

43:22.475 --> 43:24.351
-No, thanks.
-Afraid?

43:24.519 --> 43:27.145
No, I just don't feel like it.

43:35.780 --> 43:39.074
But I think marijuana should be legalized.

43:42.704 --> 43:45.706
Why do you always have
to be such a cunt?

43:53.047 --> 43:54.506
I'm sorry.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.176
Brandon, I don't mean to be a cunt.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.805
You know I've got a brother?

44:01.973 --> 44:05.309
No, I never knew that.
What grade's he in?

44:05.852 --> 44:08.061
He's not in any grade.

44:08.605 --> 44:09.646
He's retarded.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.358
Oh.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.498
I'm sorry.

44:29.792 --> 44:32.794
There's nothing to be sorry about.
He's a tough kid.

44:32.962 --> 44:35.130
He could beat you up if he wanted.

44:38.092 --> 44:41.762
I'm sorry. I mean, yeah.

44:56.569 --> 45:00.364
Brandon, are you still going to rape me?

45:02.450 --> 45:04.409
What time is it?

45:04.577 --> 45:08.538
I don't know. But I guess
I don't have to be home yet.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.916
No, there's not enough time.

45:11.084 --> 45:12.626
Thanks, Brandon.

45:12.794 --> 45:15.128
Yeah, but just remember,
this didn't happen.

45:15.296 --> 45:17.506
I mean no one, fucking no one.

45:17.674 --> 45:20.384
I swear I won't tell anybody, not a soul.

45:20.551 --> 45:24.805
Because if you do,
I really will rape you next time.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.682
Okay.

45:28.643 --> 45:31.978
I have to tell you,
I'm very upset with you three.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.356
Mommy, I didn't do anything wrong.

45:35.108 --> 45:38.694
I know. Just Mark and Dawn.

45:39.237 --> 45:42.823
- But, Mom, I already spoke to Steve.
- And did you apologize?

45:42.990 --> 45:46.785
Yes, I had to promise to give him $200
for playing at your party.

45:46.953 --> 45:48.203
Two hundred dollars?

45:48.371 --> 45:51.081
Oh, for chrissake, Harv, it's our 20th.

45:51.249 --> 45:54.209
He's coming by later
to go over some stuff with me.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.336
There's a computer-science test
tomorrow.

45:56.504 --> 45:57.796
What about you, Dawn?

45:57.964 --> 46:00.966
Will you tear down that mess
in the backyard or not?

46:05.304 --> 46:08.098
Dawn, I am talking to you.

46:09.559 --> 46:10.976
No.

46:11.144 --> 46:14.396
Dawn, listen to your mom
and forget about it.

46:14.564 --> 46:17.691
No. The clubhouse stands
and that's final.

46:18.151 --> 46:19.735
Fine.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.237
Have it your way.

46:22.405 --> 46:27.242
Dawn, be smart.
Make things easy on yourself.

46:27.410 --> 46:29.161
No.

46:30.371 --> 46:31.455
Ah....

46:32.373 --> 46:34.624
-This I like.
-Where did you get it?

46:34.792 --> 46:38.211
-The supermarket.
-I picked it out.

47:03.196 --> 47:07.157
Mom, since Dawn isn't eating hers,
can me and Mark split it?

47:07.325 --> 47:08.408
Yeah, can we?

47:10.661 --> 47:13.079
Please?

47:28.262 --> 47:30.055
Go ahead.

47:37.897 --> 47:43.235
Mark, Missy. I'm gonna need
your help this weekend.

47:43.903 --> 47:45.278
What do we have to do?

47:46.447 --> 47:49.491
Tear down that mess in the backyard.

48:16.018 --> 48:19.104
-What do you think?
-I think--

48:19.272 --> 48:22.315
Oh, Steve, they're all so beautiful.

48:22.692 --> 48:24.609
They're from the summer.

48:25.194 --> 48:27.112
Who took them?

48:28.114 --> 48:32.868
Uh, Valerie Mondello.
She's photo editor of the yearbook.

48:34.579 --> 48:36.788
Was she your girlfriend?

48:37.790 --> 48:39.875
For a few days.

48:41.294 --> 48:45.297
-It was worth it though, don't you think?
-Oh, yes.

48:47.967 --> 48:51.094
I'm thinking of using this one
for my first album cover.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.597
You're going to be on a record?

48:54.265 --> 48:58.143
It'll happen. It's gotta happen.

48:58.311 --> 49:00.186
It's just a question of time.

49:00.354 --> 49:03.064
You think before graduation?

49:03.524 --> 49:05.942
Fuck graduation.

49:07.486 --> 49:10.113
-What about college?
-Fuck college.

49:10.281 --> 49:15.285
I'm just doing this computer-science shit
with Mark for my parents.

49:15.453 --> 49:18.914
As soon as I make enough money,
I'm moving into the city.

49:19.665 --> 49:22.083
That's where it's all happening.

49:22.585 --> 49:24.085
Oh.

49:24.253 --> 49:26.504
I found the disk.

49:27.548 --> 49:28.673
Out.

49:30.509 --> 49:33.470
-No.
-What do you mean, "no"? I said, out.

49:33.638 --> 49:35.513
No. Steve and I are talking.

49:36.557 --> 49:39.726
Come on, I said, out. Come on.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.229
-Mom!
-Leave her alone.

49:43.397 --> 49:45.941
-You don't understand. This is my room.
-So what?

49:46.108 --> 49:48.360
You're being like a total fascist.

49:48.527 --> 49:50.987
What is it, Mark?

50:05.211 --> 50:07.963
Did you solve any of the problems?

50:09.006 --> 50:10.548
Good morning, students.

50:10.716 --> 50:14.594
All Hummingbird chorus members going
on a concert tour to Disney World...

50:14.762 --> 50:19.307
...must hand in signed permission slips
by this Friday at the latest.

50:20.101 --> 50:21.726
On a more worrisome note...

50:21.894 --> 50:24.938
...drugs were found extinguished
yesterday in the boys' lavatory.

50:25.106 --> 50:26.940
Now, I wanna remind you all...

50:27.108 --> 50:30.360
...that any student caught
using or selling drugs...

50:30.528 --> 50:33.405
...will be immediately expelled
from school...

50:33.572 --> 50:36.199
...and dealt with by the police authorities.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.160
There will be no exceptions.

50:39.328 --> 50:41.663
Drugs are illegal.

50:41.831 --> 50:43.915
Just say no.

50:44.250 --> 50:46.668
Thank you for your attention.

50:48.004 --> 50:50.630
-Mrs. Iannone?
-Yes, Cookie?

50:51.132 --> 50:53.466
-I have an announcement.
-Go ahead.

50:56.220 --> 51:00.432
For everyone coming to my birthday party,
remember to bring a bathing suit.

51:00.599 --> 51:01.850
That's all.

51:03.227 --> 51:05.520
Oh, my God!

51:16.574 --> 51:18.241
Shh, shh.

51:19.744 --> 51:23.204
-Hey, Cookie.
-What do you want?

51:23.706 --> 51:27.709
How come I wasn't invited?
Jed and Lance were.

51:28.544 --> 51:30.628
Oh, well, I really would have...

51:30.796 --> 51:33.965
...but we needed an even number
of girls and boys...

51:34.133 --> 51:37.761
...and if you were invited,
there would be too many boys.

51:39.305 --> 51:42.724
Well, I got something for you.

51:43.893 --> 51:46.603
-What is it?
-Open it up.

51:59.658 --> 52:02.160
I didn't eat my dessert at lunch today.

52:02.328 --> 52:04.370
I saved it for you.

52:04.538 --> 52:07.123
Now can I come to your party
this weekend?

52:07.291 --> 52:10.919
But, Brandon,
this didn't even cost anything.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.090
He's stupid.

52:28.187 --> 52:30.688

Honey, would you get--?

Where's Steve?

57:38.747 --> 57:42.125
I don't know. Leave me alone.
I'm trying to figure something out.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.593
Will you come on?

57:54.346 --> 57:57.557
- I did. A couple of times, yeah.
- Yeah?

57:59.351 --> 58:02.895
-Where's Steve?
-In the garage.

58:10.654 --> 58:13.739
Steve! Open up!

58:14.825 --> 58:16.117
Open up!

58:16.285 --> 58:18.661
-Dawn, what's up?
-I have to talk to you.

58:20.831 --> 58:25.251
-What about?
-I was wondering if....

58:29.715 --> 58:33.885
Well, I've been thinking seriously
of building another clubhouse.

58:34.052 --> 58:36.345
I wanted to know,
would you be interested...

58:36.513 --> 58:38.556
...in being my first honorary member?

58:41.018 --> 58:43.436
What? What are you talking about?

58:44.354 --> 58:46.022
The Special People Club.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.066
Special people?

58:50.110 --> 58:51.194
What's the matter?

58:52.654 --> 58:56.073
-You know what special people means?
-What?

58:56.241 --> 59:00.077
Special people equals retarded.

59:00.746 --> 59:03.831
Your club is for retards.

59:16.845 --> 59:19.805
- Hey, Mommy, look!
- I see, honey.

59:19.973 --> 59:22.767
Oh! Oh, look at Missy.
Oh, God, you are so cute.

59:23.727 --> 59:27.313
Oh, look at her dancing with Mr. Kasdan.

59:27.940 --> 59:31.776
And look at me and Steve.
Steve really likes me.

59:32.361 --> 59:34.987
- I look pretty good there.
- You sound good too.

59:35.155 --> 59:38.407
Oh, Harv, we have to get
copies of this tape.

59:38.575 --> 59:41.118
Unfortunately, Steve just quit the band.

59:41.286 --> 59:44.121
-What?
-What? I just gave him $200.

59:44.289 --> 59:47.667
Didn't you just tell me that he got an A
in computer-science final?

59:47.834 --> 59:50.628
It's not that.
He dropped out of school and left town.

59:50.796 --> 59:53.756
He wants to try making it in New York
as the next Jim Morrison.

59:53.924 --> 59:57.093
-Stupid kid. He'll never make it.
-That's what I told him.

59:57.261 --> 1:00:00.096
-He'll never get into a good school now.
-He won't make it.

1:00:00.264 --> 1:00:02.640
-Never make it.
-Never.

1:00:07.688 --> 1:00:10.940
Mommy, let's watch it again.

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:36.901
You're so lucky.

1:03:00.736 --> 1:03:03.279
Would you ask Brandon McCarthy
to step outside?

1:03:03.447 --> 1:03:04.488
Is something wrong?

1:03:04.656 --> 1:03:07.032
The police wanna ask him
a few questions.

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:08.868
Brandon, come up here.

1:03:12.372 --> 1:03:14.331
You can leave your test.

1:03:18.295 --> 1:03:20.379
Come along, Brandon.

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:23.132
Come on. This way.

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:25.968
Thank you, Martha.
Sorry for the interruption.

1:03:46.531 --> 1:03:49.784
Oh, Dawn! Oh, I'm so glad
I caught you. Listen now.

1:03:49.951 --> 1:03:53.746
Dad just called. His car broke down.
I have to pick him up at the car dealer.

1:03:53.914 --> 1:03:57.208
I've left a note in the kitchen
for Missy to give to Mrs. Golden.

1:03:57.375 --> 1:03:59.710
But in case she doesn't see it
when she gets in...

1:03:59.878 --> 1:04:03.214
...be sure to tell her to get a ride home
from ballet with her.

1:04:03.381 --> 1:04:05.549
I can't pick her up like I told her I would.

1:04:05.717 --> 1:04:07.760
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1:04:07.928 --> 1:04:10.137
-Now, you won't forget?
-No.

1:04:30.450 --> 1:04:32.576
And that means hungry for love.

1:04:33.036 --> 1:04:36.789
They haven't gotten enough love.
They haven't gotten enough affection.

1:04:36.957 --> 1:04:39.792
They haven't gotten enough attention
from their partner...

1:04:41.211 --> 1:04:43.128
...or from the people in their life.

1:04:43.296 --> 1:04:46.632
I like to think of your relationship
as a living, breathing thing.

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:49.468
I have found in my program
that there are five things....

1:04:49.636 --> 1:04:51.428
I'll get it.

1:04:53.557 --> 1:04:57.142
Wiener residence.
Who may I ask is calling, please?

1:04:58.979 --> 1:05:00.312
It's Ralphy.

1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:03.482
-Tell him I'm punished.
-But you're not punished.

1:05:03.650 --> 1:05:05.818
I don't feel like talking to him.

1:05:05.986 --> 1:05:09.071
But he's your friend. So here.

1:05:09.948 --> 1:05:11.198
Dawn.

1:05:11.366 --> 1:05:14.159
Hang it up!
I don't wanna speak to that faggot.

1:05:14.327 --> 1:05:16.620
- But, Dawn--
- Hang it up!

1:05:16.788 --> 1:05:18.289
But he's your friend.

1:05:18.456 --> 1:05:20.833
He is not! He's a spy and an asshole.

1:05:21.001 --> 1:05:24.295
- But, Dawn, Ralphy likes you.
- Yeah? That's too bad.

1:05:24.462 --> 1:05:26.839
You can tell him I hope he rots in hell.

1:05:27.007 --> 1:05:29.383
Dawn, maybe you should
say you're sorry.

1:05:29.551 --> 1:05:30.968
Fuck you!

1:05:34.973 --> 1:05:37.141
After receiving
a moving thank-you letter....

1:05:37.309 --> 1:05:40.269
You know you're not supposed to drink
in the TV room.

1:05:42.772 --> 1:05:45.024
Oh, hey, Missy!

1:05:45.567 --> 1:05:47.192
What?

1:05:49.029 --> 1:05:52.156
- This was the fat guy.
- Nothing.

1:05:53.617 --> 1:05:56.577
We're looking at a 54-inch waist there.

1:05:56.745 --> 1:05:59.079
And well over 400 pounds.

1:05:59.247 --> 1:06:02.583
For once, I started feeling.

1:06:09.299 --> 1:06:13.302
- Mother describes her as....
- The Prima Donna Ballet School.

1:06:14.679 --> 1:06:15.930
Ain't seen her since 6:15.

1:06:16.097 --> 1:06:18.057
54 pounds, brown hair, blue eyes...

1:06:18.224 --> 1:06:22.728
...last seen wearing a pink leotard,
pink ballet slippers and a pink tutu.

1:06:22.896 --> 1:06:24.229
- You copy that?
- Yep.

1:06:24.397 --> 1:06:27.942
- She has an older sister, 11 and a half.
- Gave her the note from her mom.

1:06:28.109 --> 1:06:31.487
- Claims to have given her the note.
- Sister says she gave her the note.

1:06:31.655 --> 1:06:34.573
Yeah, well, she claims
to have given her the note.

1:06:37.827 --> 1:06:41.664
- This was taken last summer.
- So you're not going to school today?

1:06:41.831 --> 1:06:44.249
No, Mom's afraid I'll be kidnapped also.

1:06:44.417 --> 1:06:47.461
-Yeah, right.
-What?

1:06:47.629 --> 1:06:49.505
Never mind.

1:06:58.473 --> 1:07:00.557
What do you think they're looking for?

1:07:00.725 --> 1:07:02.768
-Clues.
-But she's not here.

1:07:02.936 --> 1:07:04.770
Uh, duh.

1:07:05.814 --> 1:07:08.440
- You think you can use that one?
- Yes.

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:17.741
This one was here was taken
the last week of May.

1:07:17.909 --> 1:07:19.326
Excuse me, sergeant.

1:07:21.162 --> 1:07:23.080
Do you think they'll find her?

1:07:23.248 --> 1:07:25.833
-Are you the big sister?
-Yeah.

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:29.336
-And you're the big brother?
-Yeah.

1:07:29.504 --> 1:07:33.298
Take whatever you need.
I just want my Missy.

1:07:33.758 --> 1:07:35.134
Excuse me.

1:07:41.266 --> 1:07:42.349
Dad's real sick.

1:07:42.517 --> 1:07:45.936
-He probably has to go to the hospital.
-What's wrong with him?

1:07:46.104 --> 1:07:49.523
The doctor's not sure, but Mom thinks
it might be a nervous breakdown.

1:07:49.691 --> 1:07:51.442
It's probably just his gallbladder.

1:07:53.111 --> 1:07:56.697
- I'll help, Mom.
- Thank you, Dawn. Here.

1:07:56.865 --> 1:07:59.408
Take that to your father
while I talk to the sergeant.

1:07:59.576 --> 1:08:01.201
Sure, Mom.

1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:04.955
We'll get this bastard.

1:08:14.090 --> 1:08:15.799
Dad?

1:08:17.302 --> 1:08:19.845
I brought you some tea.

1:08:20.555 --> 1:08:22.598
How are you feeling?

1:08:23.558 --> 1:08:25.184
Better?

1:08:26.478 --> 1:08:30.022
Well, don't worry. They'll find Missy.

1:08:30.190 --> 1:08:32.191
I'm sure of it.

1:08:32.734 --> 1:08:35.652
And if they don't, well...

1:08:36.196 --> 1:08:38.781
...remember, you still got me and Mark.

1:09:10.647 --> 1:09:13.816
Hello. Want a bite?

1:09:16.611 --> 1:09:20.322
Tommy? Tommy.

1:09:20.490 --> 1:09:22.783
Go on, get back in the kitchen.

1:09:23.785 --> 1:09:26.370
-Who are you?
-Dawn Wiener.

1:09:26.538 --> 1:09:30.207
-I'm a friend of Brandon McCarthy.
-What do you want?

1:09:30.375 --> 1:09:34.086
Well, like, I was wondering
if I could see Brandon.

1:09:34.254 --> 1:09:37.631
-How come you're not in school?
-My sister was kidnapped.

1:09:38.758 --> 1:09:41.135
My mom let me stay home today.

1:09:41.302 --> 1:09:44.972
-So, what do you want with Brandon?
-I wanted to talk to him.

1:09:45.140 --> 1:09:48.851
-What'd he do, knock you up?
-No, no.

1:09:49.853 --> 1:09:53.021
Okay, then, go ahead.
You can go say goodbye to him.

1:09:53.189 --> 1:09:55.816
Go on up the stairs at the back.

1:09:56.526 --> 1:09:59.528
But you got just one hour,
then we're leaving.

1:09:59.696 --> 1:10:01.196
Thanks, Mr. McCarthy.

1:10:38.401 --> 1:10:40.360
Hi, Brandon.

1:10:41.988 --> 1:10:43.947
What are you doing here?

1:10:45.241 --> 1:10:49.661
I tried calling, but my mom wouldn't
let me because my sister was kidnapped.

1:10:49.829 --> 1:10:52.414
Yeah, I heard. So, what do you want?

1:11:06.179 --> 1:11:08.764
I wanna be your girlfriend.

1:11:09.307 --> 1:11:12.142
Too late. I'm leaving.

1:11:13.019 --> 1:11:15.854
-Where are you going?
-None of your business.

1:11:16.022 --> 1:11:18.982
-Can I come along?
-No.

1:11:19.150 --> 1:11:22.069
-Are you gonna go back to school?
-Pssh.

1:11:22.237 --> 1:11:24.154
No way, man.

1:11:24.989 --> 1:11:26.949
I'm not going to no reformatory either.

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:29.826
My dad thinks I'm going,
but he can go to hell.

1:11:29.994 --> 1:11:31.954
I'm getting out of here.

1:11:33.623 --> 1:11:35.624
You mean, you're running away?

1:11:35.792 --> 1:11:38.710
Yup, to New York.

1:11:42.090 --> 1:11:45.300
-Does anybody know?
-No.

1:11:49.389 --> 1:11:51.390
Get off of me.

1:11:51.975 --> 1:11:54.810
I'm the one that makes the first move.

1:12:03.987 --> 1:12:06.655
-Now, come on.
-Right now?

1:12:06.823 --> 1:12:08.240
Now or never.

1:12:08.408 --> 1:12:10.951
-But I can't now.
-Why not? Are you scared?

1:12:11.119 --> 1:12:13.120
-No, but I--
-What?

1:12:13.288 --> 1:12:14.830
Can't you wait a little longer?

1:12:14.998 --> 1:12:18.959
I'm sure Mr. Edwards will let you back in
if you stop dealing drugs.

1:12:19.127 --> 1:12:21.169
Who said I deal drugs?

1:12:21.337 --> 1:12:24.006
But, Brandon, everyone says....

1:12:26.384 --> 1:12:28.844
And you believe them all.

1:12:29.637 --> 1:12:32.472
You mean, you didn't?

1:12:34.017 --> 1:12:37.102
Asshole. Jed's the one that deals.

1:12:37.270 --> 1:12:39.146
But, hey, don't feel bad.

1:12:39.897 --> 1:12:44.318
You're like everyone else.
You think I'm some lying asshole.

1:12:44.485 --> 1:12:48.113
And you know something, Dawn?
I don't give a fuck.

1:12:48.281 --> 1:12:50.282
I believe you.

1:12:51.492 --> 1:12:53.785
Gee, thanks. I feel so much better.

1:12:53.953 --> 1:12:56.121
-But I really do!
-The fuck you do.

1:12:56.289 --> 1:12:58.540
Brandon, I do!

1:12:59.792 --> 1:13:02.502
-Lying piece of shit.
-Brandon, please wait.

1:13:02.670 --> 1:13:06.381
-I'm so sorry.
-Well, it's too late. I'm getting out of here.

1:13:06.549 --> 1:13:09.301
And who knows?
Maybe I will deal drugs now.

1:13:09.469 --> 1:13:12.346
You packed?
We're leaving in 10 minutes.

1:13:15.725 --> 1:13:17.684
Well, you coming?

1:13:21.105 --> 1:13:22.272
I can't.

1:13:24.359 --> 1:13:28.612
Brandon, wait! Please don't go!

1:14:13.783 --> 1:14:15.742
So how's Dad?

1:14:18.996 --> 1:14:20.622
They don't know yet.

1:14:20.790 --> 1:14:23.542
They're still doing more testing.

1:14:23.709 --> 1:14:25.627
Can I visit him?

1:14:28.631 --> 1:14:31.633
What are you doing tomorrow
after school?

1:14:31.801 --> 1:14:35.220
Tomorrow's no good.
I've got a big forensic-society debate.

1:14:35.388 --> 1:14:37.764
But I'm sure I can get out of it.

1:14:39.058 --> 1:14:42.686
No, Mark. Go.

1:14:43.646 --> 1:14:46.398
I want you to. It's important.

1:14:47.483 --> 1:14:50.402
Dawn can come with me
to the hospital...

1:14:50.570 --> 1:14:54.322
...and I'll get your Aunt Phyllis
to stay by the phone.

1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:58.785
Hello? Yes.

1:15:05.501 --> 1:15:07.043
Oh.

1:15:08.504 --> 1:15:12.257
In-- In Times Square?

1:15:12.425 --> 1:15:14.676
Are you sure?

1:15:17.430 --> 1:15:18.930
Yes.

1:15:20.391 --> 1:15:22.017
Thank you.

1:15:26.689 --> 1:15:29.065
They found her tutu.

1:16:42.974 --> 1:16:46.393
Excuse me. Have you seen my sister?

1:16:49.939 --> 1:16:53.858
Pardon me. Have you seen my sister?
Her name is Missy Wiener.

1:16:54.860 --> 1:16:56.194
No.

1:17:00.950 --> 1:17:02.409
No, no.

1:17:03.244 --> 1:17:04.411
Have you seen my sister?

1:17:04.579 --> 1:17:06.413
-Her name's Missy Wiener.
-No!

1:17:25.016 --> 1:17:27.100
Help! Dawn, help me!

1:17:27.268 --> 1:17:29.019
Dawn, Dawn! Help me!

1:17:29.186 --> 1:17:31.521
Help me, Dawn! Help!

1:17:31.689 --> 1:17:33.607
Help me, Dawn!

1:17:33.774 --> 1:17:35.108
-Help me, Dawn!
-Missy?

1:17:35.276 --> 1:17:38.612
-Help me! Help!
-Missy-- Wait! Wait!

1:17:38.779 --> 1:17:43.283
-Stop! Stop! Let go of my sister!
-Dawn, help me, help me!

1:17:48.706 --> 1:17:50.332
Oh. Oh!

1:17:50.499 --> 1:17:52.083
Oh, Dawn.

1:17:52.251 --> 1:17:56.379
Oh, Dawn, you're the best daughter
a mother could have.

1:17:56.547 --> 1:17:59.215
-I love you so much.
-I love you, Dawn.

1:17:59.383 --> 1:18:01.635
Me too. I love you.

1:18:01.802 --> 1:18:03.637
Oh, Dawn, I love you.

1:18:03.804 --> 1:18:06.765
-Dawn, I love you.
-You know I've always loved you.

1:18:06.932 --> 1:18:08.933
Oh, Dawn, we love you.

1:18:40.841 --> 1:18:44.386
-Yeah, I'll accept.
-Hi, Mark. It's Dawn.

1:18:44.553 --> 1:18:46.012
Boy, are you in trouble.

1:18:46.180 --> 1:18:48.306
-Where are you?
-New York.

1:18:48.474 --> 1:18:51.101
-What are you doing there?
-I ran away.

1:18:51.602 --> 1:18:54.854
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. I thought I might find Missy.

1:18:55.064 --> 1:18:58.817
-Heh. Way to go.
-Is Mom real upset?

1:18:58.984 --> 1:19:01.778
Not really.
They found Missy this morning.

1:19:01.946 --> 1:19:03.321
Is she dead?

1:19:03.489 --> 1:19:06.491
No, she's fine.
Mr. Kasdan kidnapped her.

1:19:06.659 --> 1:19:07.867
Really?

1:19:08.035 --> 1:19:10.829
Yeah, Mrs. Kasdan is gonna file
for divorce now.

1:19:10.996 --> 1:19:14.165
Turns out he'd built this room
beneath the shuffleboard court...

1:19:14.333 --> 1:19:16.584
-...and kept her there.
-Did he rape her?

1:19:16.752 --> 1:19:20.547
No. I think he videotaped her
doing pirouettes, but that's it.

1:19:20.715 --> 1:19:24.175
-Is she in the hospital?
-No, she's here.

1:19:24.343 --> 1:19:28.346
She's the same. You know,
I think she may have liked being there...

1:19:28.514 --> 1:19:31.599
...because she had her own TV
and total control over the pusher.

1:19:32.184 --> 1:19:36.146
She also got to have as much candy
and McDonald's as she wanted.

1:19:36.313 --> 1:19:37.605
Can you get Mom?

1:19:37.773 --> 1:19:39.733
Yeah, hold on.

1:19:41.902 --> 1:19:44.237
- Mom, it's Dawn.
- Will you move?

1:19:44.405 --> 1:19:46.573
- Where the fuck is Sam?
- Hurry it up.

1:19:46.741 --> 1:19:50.243
Can you call back a little later?
She's being interviewed.

1:19:50.411 --> 1:19:51.578
Okay.

1:20:00.171 --> 1:20:05.300
And now, students, I'd like you
to give your attention to Dawn Wiener.

1:20:18.939 --> 1:20:21.065
"I'm standing here today...

1:20:21.233 --> 1:20:24.110
...to express my and my family's thanks...

1:20:24.278 --> 1:20:28.740
...for the support in helping us get
through this hor-- Terrible ordeal.

1:20:30.868 --> 1:20:34.579
If it hadn't been for your help
in providing the police...

1:20:34.747 --> 1:20:39.375
...with the information leading
to the conviction of Joseph Kasdan...

1:20:39.710 --> 1:20:43.046
...my sister might not be here today.

1:20:43.214 --> 1:20:48.551
Your emotional and moral support
has been invaluable.

1:20:49.428 --> 1:20:53.640
Missy has always been like
a sister to me...

1:20:53.808 --> 1:20:55.809
- ...and a friend--"
- Wiener dog!

1:20:55.976 --> 1:20:58.895
- Be quiet!
- "And now that she is safe and sound--"

1:20:59.063 --> 1:21:00.605
Wiener dog!

1:21:00.773 --> 1:21:03.399
-Wiener dog!
-Wiener dog!

1:21:03.567 --> 1:21:05.610
Wiener dog, Wiener dog.

1:21:05.778 --> 1:21:06.820
"Now that she's safe--"

1:21:06.987 --> 1:21:10.281
Wiener dog, Wiener dog, Wiener dog.

1:21:17.790 --> 1:21:19.749
Quiet!

1:21:25.256 --> 1:21:26.297
Go on, Dawn.

1:21:33.222 --> 1:21:37.934
"I can rest easy in the knowledge that--
That Missy is fine.

1:21:38.102 --> 1:21:40.186
Thank you very much."

1:21:43.148 --> 1:21:45.191
--were unavailable for comment.

1:21:45.359 --> 1:21:47.527
Friends and neighbors,
shocked at his arrest...

1:21:47.695 --> 1:21:50.154
...described Joseph Kasdan
as a regular family man...

1:21:50.322 --> 1:21:52.866
...who would often dress up
as Santa at Christmastime.

1:21:53.033 --> 1:21:55.577
And now we bring you
an interview from our own....

1:21:55.744 --> 1:21:59.247
-Can you get me a bag of popcorn?
-And a glass of Diet Coke.

1:21:59.415 --> 1:22:01.207
-And Hawaiian Punch.
-Okay.

1:22:01.375 --> 1:22:04.252
Did he touch you at all in any way?

1:22:04.587 --> 1:22:06.296
I don't know.

1:22:08.007 --> 1:22:11.676
Anyway, I bet you're happy
to be home with Mommy.

1:22:12.261 --> 1:22:13.761
Yes.

1:22:17.683 --> 1:22:23.354
So tell me, Mrs. Wiener,
how did you feel when you discovered....

1:22:24.356 --> 1:22:29.444
Mark, is eighth grade
better than seventh?

1:22:29.612 --> 1:22:31.404
Not really.

1:22:31.947 --> 1:22:33.698
What about ninth?

1:22:35.367 --> 1:22:37.327
All of junior high school sucks.

1:22:37.494 --> 1:22:40.288
High school's better. It's closer to college.

1:22:40.456 --> 1:22:44.375
They'll call you names,
but not as much to your face.

1:22:48.839 --> 1:22:52.967
How did you feel being
kidnapped and being held hostage?

1:22:53.135 --> 1:22:55.762
- Were you scared?
- No.

1:22:55.930 --> 1:22:58.681
I don't wanna go to Disney World.

1:22:58.849 --> 1:23:02.727
Don't be stupid. If nothing else,
it'll look good on your college résumé.
