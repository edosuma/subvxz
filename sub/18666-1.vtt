00:34.851 --> 00:36.045
<i>In the news tonight...</i>

00:36.219 --> 00:39.416
<i>...the music world mourns the death</i>
<i>of folk music icon Irving Steinbloom...</i>

00:40.857 --> 00:42.984
<i>...an instrumental figure</i>
<i>in guiding folk music...</i>

00:43.159 --> 00:48.722
<i>...from its humble beginnings in the 1950s</i>
<i>to its zenith in popularity in the 1960s.</i>

00:48.898 --> 00:52.664
<i>Steinbloom managed the careers</i>
<i>of such million-selling folk groups as...</i>

00:52.836 --> 00:55.361
<i>...The Main Street Singers,</i>
<i>The Folksmen...</i>

00:55.538 --> 00:58.905
<i>...and the sweethearts</i>
<i>of the folk music scene, Mitch and Mickey.</i>

00:59.075 --> 01:01.441
<i>Their music was the voice of a generation.</i>

01:01.611 --> 01:03.511
<i>It carried a message of peace and freedom...</i>

01:03.680 --> 01:06.444
<i>...and young people got behind</i>
<i>the message in a big way.</i>

01:06.616 --> 01:10.052
<i>Steinbloom is survived</i>
<i>by his wife and three children.</i>

01:17.527 --> 01:21.520
What do you say, Mitch? It's up to you.
Are you going to be with us?

01:22.966 --> 01:25.366
Yes, we do. We have all three Folksmen.

01:25.568 --> 01:28.401
Of course, Alan, of course.
He was the first to--

01:28.571 --> 01:32.302
We can't imagine doing this without you.
It's as simple as that.

01:32.475 --> 01:35.569
We cannot conceive of doing this--

01:36.112 --> 01:41.049
It seemed that the only fitting tribute
to this fantastic human being--

01:41.217 --> 01:44.618
And I have to tell you,
my dad was really an amazing character.

01:47.123 --> 01:51.150
And the only fitting tribute we could
come up with was a memorial to my dad...

01:51.327 --> 01:54.763
...that would be a concert
that would be performed...

01:54.931 --> 01:59.834
...by all of the fabulous groups
and people that he used to represent.

02:00.537 --> 02:05.133
It's gonna be very fast. It's gonna be in
two weeks. And it had to be in Town Hall...

02:05.308 --> 02:09.369
...because where else could we have
such an event? It had to be Town Hall.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.140
And they had a hole in the schedule.

02:12.315 --> 02:14.749
But it's a very sudden hole...

02:14.918 --> 02:19.821
...and we've got two weeks
to put together this very complicated event.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.320
But I'm pretty organized myself.

02:24.494 --> 02:27.190
I've always been a very organized person.

02:27.363 --> 02:33.302
When I was 12, I formed the J.C.P.L.,
the Jewish Children's Polo League.

02:33.803 --> 02:38.433
We rode Shetland ponies instead of horses.
It was funny, my mom used to say:

02:38.608 --> 02:42.100
"Well, if he has to fall,
he shouldn't fall from so very high."

02:42.278 --> 02:45.372
She was very protective.
You could say overly protective.

02:45.548 --> 02:48.881
I just like to think she cared about me.
Which she did, a lot.

02:49.052 --> 02:51.316
And I was a member of the chess team.

02:51.487 --> 02:55.446
And whenever we had chess tournaments,
I had to wear a protective helmet.

02:55.625 --> 02:59.322
I had to wear a football helmet.
Now, who knows what she was thinking?

02:59.495 --> 03:02.123
Maybe she thought
we might have fallen...

03:02.298 --> 03:05.995
...and impaled our heads on a pointy
bishop or something, I don't know.

03:06.336 --> 03:09.305
<i>Now they don't allow no frowns inside</i>
<i>Leave them by the door</i>

03:11.774 --> 03:15.005
<i>-There's apple brandy by the keg</i>
<i>-And sawdust on the floor</i>

03:15.178 --> 03:19.478
<i>So if you've got a hankering</i>
<i>I'll tell you where to go</i>

03:19.649 --> 03:23.141
<i>Just look for the busted neon sign</i>
<i>That flashes</i>

03:23.319 --> 03:25.844
<i>Ea-a-oe's</i>

03:26.956 --> 03:31.222
<i>Well, there's a puppy in the parlor</i>
<i>And a skillet on the stove</i>

03:35.265 --> 03:37.392
<i>Hello, Mr. Stranger Man</i>

03:39.836 --> 03:41.770
-Who is that?
-Who are any of us?

03:43.940 --> 03:45.237
No!

03:47.243 --> 03:48.938
I'll take some of that.

03:49.512 --> 03:53.346
-Mr. Palter has an altar, I see.
-Yeah. The Palter Porch.

03:54.517 --> 03:56.747
-I knew you looked familiar.
-Just a little.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.549
I think I used to work with your kids.
A couple of young guys....

04:00.723 --> 04:04.215
Mark and I met at
the University of Vermont in about '61 ?

04:04.394 --> 04:05.418
Late '61 .

04:05.595 --> 04:09.656
We were both interested in folk music,
and there was a big folk music scene...

04:11.834 --> 04:14.928
...as there were on many colleges.
We formed The Twobadours.

04:15.104 --> 04:17.231
-Two. T-W-O.
-Badours.

04:17.406 --> 04:21.274
Because there were two of us.
That was the reasoning behind the name.

04:21.444 --> 04:24.902
-Mark was a bass, really, a bass singer.
-I sang way down here.

04:25.081 --> 04:29.381
And I was a tenor singer up there.
And so we had no lead....

04:29.552 --> 04:31.543
No glue. No middle, no....

04:31.721 --> 04:35.122
Vocalist. We went to New York
to see what was happening in the biz.

04:35.291 --> 04:37.452
-We were playing at a place....
-The Folk Place.

04:37.627 --> 04:42.121
At The Folk Place, which was a wonderful
club at the time and we ran into--

04:42.298 --> 04:44.232
It was the flash point.
It really was.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.597
Everyone-- It was Like a big magnet,
everyone went there.

04:47.770 --> 04:52.764
-He was singing, he was backing people up--
-I thought I was a guitar player at the time.

04:52.942 --> 04:58.312
If you have enough vibrato on those blue
Fender guitars, you sound Like a surf king.

04:58.481 --> 05:02.542
I was drawn to the folk music as well
and I wound up down at The Folk Place...

05:02.719 --> 05:04.084
...and met these two guys.

05:04.253 --> 05:09.088
I could play the guitar. I could sing right
in the middle there, mostly sang for myself.

05:09.258 --> 05:13.160
-Not a bad-looking gent, to boot.
-No, that's true. That didn't hurt.

05:13.329 --> 05:16.264
We ended up getting together
and it just kind of....

05:16.432 --> 05:17.729
-It clicked.
-It clicked.

05:17.900 --> 05:22.098
And Mr. Irving Steinbloom came down
and he signed us to Folk Town...

05:22.305 --> 05:24.432
-...which was the label to be on.
-Terrific Label.

05:25.775 --> 05:27.936
Later on we were
kind of moved down the food chain...

05:29.579 --> 05:31.672
...to the Folk Tone Label
which was a subsidiary.

05:33.216 --> 05:36.049
It was a decent Label,
they just didn't have the distribution.

05:36.219 --> 05:39.211
-They didn't have any distribution.
-No distribution at all.

05:39.389 --> 05:42.688
And the covers were printed
in two colors instead of four...

05:42.859 --> 05:44.850
...which I noticed was a problem.

05:45.028 --> 05:48.486
And they had no hole
in the center of the record--

05:48.664 --> 05:50.495
No, you had to provide it yourself.

05:50.666 --> 05:54.329
So the people complained
that you'd get this vinyl, in those days...

05:54.504 --> 05:58.907
-...and it's up to you to center it.
-It would teeter crazily on the spindle.

05:59.075 --> 06:02.841
And that was, of course, we had
no control over that aspect of it.

06:03.012 --> 06:05.242
They were still good records.
Good product.

06:05.415 --> 06:08.543
If you punched a hole in them,
you'd have a good time.

06:08.885 --> 06:13.322
<i>It's scary but it's true</i>
<i>So do what the Good Book tells you to</i>

06:17.760 --> 06:22.220
<i>I guess it was in about 1958</i>
<i>in Greenwich Village.</i>

06:22.398 --> 06:25.231
My partner Chuck Wiseman
and myself had gotten together...

06:25.401 --> 06:27.130
...with Fred Knox and Bill Weyburn.

06:28.938 --> 06:33.307
We were lucky to be joined by one
of the greatest talents of our generation...

06:33.476 --> 06:37.913
...any generation, as a matter of fact,
Ramblin' Sandy Pitnik.

06:38.281 --> 06:41.409
And we became the Village Folk Ensemble.

06:42.218 --> 06:45.984
And we were a great group. Great.
We had a good sound...

06:46.155 --> 06:50.353
...but I always thought we should have
something bigger, a fuller sound.

06:50.526 --> 06:55.225
And one night in 1960,
I'LL never forget this...

06:55.398 --> 06:59.198
...we were at a hootenanny and we
were jamming with the Klapper Family.

06:59.368 --> 07:03.771
And all of a sudden, I heard it.
The sound that I'd been thinking about.

07:03.940 --> 07:06.204
The harmonics were amazing.

07:06.809 --> 07:11.746
I thought, "Well, there's five of us,
there's four of them. It's a <i>neuf-</i> tet."

07:12.381 --> 07:15.441
And it was there, just in a moment,
it was all there.

07:15.618 --> 07:17.643
The <i>neuf-</i> tet sound.

07:17.820 --> 07:21.551
This thing clicked with The Klappers
too, so we joined forces...

07:21.724 --> 07:23.692
...and became The Main Street Singers.

07:25.294 --> 07:30.891
Well, 10 years and 30 albums later,
we disbanded, but we'd had a good run.

07:31.067 --> 07:34.901
My partner Chuck Wiseman and myself,
we called it quits too.

07:35.071 --> 07:38.199
I went my way and Chuck went his.

07:38.374 --> 07:41.707
In 1971 , after the breakup
of The Main Street Singers...

07:44.280 --> 07:47.772
...Chuck Wiseman moved to San Francisco
where he started a business...

07:47.950 --> 07:51.545
...with his two brothers.
The Three Wiseman's Sex Emporium.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.882
It was very successful for a year...

07:54.056 --> 07:57.822
...until they were sued over something
having to do with a box of benwa balls.

07:58.161 --> 08:01.426
No, I need you, Mitch.
I need Mitch and Mickey. Mitch and Mickey.

08:01.597 --> 08:04.065
That's the thing. You go together.

08:04.233 --> 08:09.296
I love Mickey, but without you
it's not the same. You got to think--

08:09.972 --> 08:14.966
I'm gonna tell you something, Mitch,
and I've never told anybody this before.

08:15.144 --> 08:17.169
You were Dad's favorite. Okay.

08:17.346 --> 08:21.783
Just deal with it. You were Dad's favorite.
I've never said this to a single soul.

08:21.951 --> 08:26.411
Two weeks before he died
he took me aside and he said to me:

08:26.589 --> 08:30.491
"Of all those <i>ferkakte</i> people,
I Love Mitch, he's my favorite.

08:30.660 --> 08:33.322
He's like a relative,
he's Like my nephew to me."

08:33.496 --> 08:37.761
I'm saying this because I think you'd want
to know before you make your mind up.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.663
Would you just think about it?

08:49.445 --> 08:53.779
<i>Sounds cliche, but it's kind of a blur,</i>
<i>you know? They loved us.</i>

08:53.950 --> 08:58.978
I guess we were, in a way, maybe easy
to Love because we represented...

09:01.524 --> 09:04.015
...true Love and romance
and sweetness, and....

09:04.894 --> 09:09.092
To be quite honest, I bought
the image as much as anyone else.

09:09.265 --> 09:12.234
Maybe that's why I sold it so well.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.861
Because it was sweet and happy...

09:15.571 --> 09:18.699
...and everybody, everybody
loved to hang around Mitch.

09:18.874 --> 09:22.901
They tried to get close to him,
but I was close to him.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.577
He was very smart, very intense...

09:28.217 --> 09:29.946
...and distant, you know?

09:30.119 --> 09:34.249
You'd get close to him and he'd inch back
that much further, you know.

09:34.423 --> 09:38.120
And you'd move in,
you know, to get inside Mitch...

09:38.294 --> 09:40.421
...and he'd just back off a little more.

09:40.596 --> 09:45.124
Just always kept you wanting to get there,
to understand him.

09:45.301 --> 09:47.269
Which was impossible.

09:47.503 --> 09:52.668
<i>Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted</i>

09:55.111 --> 09:58.239
<i>And the fairy tales have all been told</i>

09:58.414 --> 10:02.783
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

10:06.355 --> 10:12.692
<i>More precious than a pot of gold</i>

10:17.533 --> 10:20.468
The phenomenon of that kiss was....

10:21.370 --> 10:23.770
It can't be overstated.

10:23.939 --> 10:25.133
It was...

10:27.243 --> 10:31.805
...a superb moment
in the history of folk music.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.072
And maybe...

10:34.984 --> 10:38.385
...maybe a great moment
in the history of humans.

10:38.888 --> 10:45.350
I'd Like to think that Mitch
would agree to do this with me.

10:46.162 --> 10:50.428
Because I already said yes.
And I can't do it alone, so....

10:51.167 --> 10:53.658
No, I didn't think this through.

10:53.969 --> 10:58.303
Should've talked to him beforehand,
but I haven't talked to him in so long.

10:59.675 --> 11:02.473
It wasn't....
We weren't talking.

11:03.846 --> 11:06.337
You know, those last few years....

11:07.683 --> 11:12.950
Okay, I'm remembering some things now,
yeah. There was lots of fighting going on.

11:13.356 --> 11:16.655
And I think for a while we were able...

11:17.226 --> 11:20.218
...to keep it on a professional level.

11:21.063 --> 11:25.056
But really, we were getting
some personal things out.

11:26.068 --> 11:29.265
I was just out of high school,
I had just started here.

11:31.040 --> 11:35.033
And I must say I was in awe of Mitch
and Mickey. I mean, who wasn't?

11:36.946 --> 11:39.278
They were here working on
<i>When You're Next To Me</i>...

11:39.448 --> 11:41.541
...which was their Last album together.

11:41.717 --> 11:45.653
Mickey started shouting at Mitch.
She just went off.

11:45.821 --> 11:50.224
She started throwing anything she could
get her hands on at Mitch. Anything.

11:50.593 --> 11:56.225
Music stands, microphone stands,
mikes, guitars.

11:56.932 --> 11:58.866
And Mitch....

12:00.736 --> 12:02.499
He just....

12:03.906 --> 12:06.067
He just snapped.

12:08.377 --> 12:11.244
<i>It's time to kick on back</i>
<i>Toss your cares away</i>

12:17.386 --> 12:22.619
<i>Cartwheels and piggybacks</i>
<i>It's just that kind of day</i>

12:23.325 --> 12:29.753
<i>I'm sitting on a hill</i>
<i>Watching clouds at play</i>

12:30.666 --> 12:34.067
Well, I've been playing
the music of The Main Street Singers...

12:34.236 --> 12:38.002
...my whole life, I mean,
from way back in Tampa.

12:38.374 --> 12:42.777
I've come to understand as an adult,
with the help of Laurie, my beautiful wife...

12:45.714 --> 12:51.744
...that there had been abuse in my family,
but it was mostly musical in nature.

12:51.921 --> 12:55.379
My father used to
lock me away in a room...

12:55.558 --> 12:59.619
...with nothing but the Percy Faith
recording of "Bim Bam Boom" ...

12:59.795 --> 13:03.356
...and then send me to bed
with nothing but dessert.

13:04.266 --> 13:07.258
One of the records he put me
in there with was <i>Sunny Side Up</i>.

13:07.436 --> 13:09.097
The Main Street Singers, 1968.

13:10.473 --> 13:13.203
I tell you, my head opened up,
my heart opened up.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.139
I listened to that record
over and over and over.

13:16.312 --> 13:18.974
I knew it right and left
and every way to Sunday.

13:19.148 --> 13:24.950
I feel Like I knew those people.
I wanted to be in that group so badly...

13:25.120 --> 13:29.386
...that at the age of 8 years old,
I went down into the basement...

13:29.558 --> 13:34.154
...and I made cardboard cutouts of
everybody in the group to sing with them.

13:34.330 --> 13:37.788
These were my friends,
and they were made out of gin boxes.

13:38.100 --> 13:41.194
It's odd that Laurie
came from such a different--

13:41.370 --> 13:43.429
Right. A completely different path.

13:43.606 --> 13:47.599
I was brought up in a very small town,
south of the Chicago city limits.

13:47.776 --> 13:52.577
Just far enough away to have been peopled
with pure, unadulterated white trash.

13:52.748 --> 13:56.980
And because I was one of so many children,
I don't believe that anyone noticed...

13:57.152 --> 14:02.112
...when I blew town at 15
and ended up in San Francisco, California.

14:02.291 --> 14:06.193
And it's at this point in my story
that the dark clouds part...

14:06.362 --> 14:11.664
...because I met a certain Mr. Wiseman,
who gave me a job in his shop.

14:11.834 --> 14:15.270
And before Long, he tapped me
to do some small roles...

14:15.437 --> 14:20.500
...in some of his short films
for more mature audiences.

14:20.676 --> 14:24.442
And before Long, I had landed,
if you will, some leads...

14:24.613 --> 14:28.447
...and then I started to do some cameos.

14:29.051 --> 14:33.420
Well, I was known for
doing a certain thing...

14:33.589 --> 14:36.524
...that many of the other girls
wouldn't do.

14:36.892 --> 14:40.089
Of course, I Loved to sing,
ever since I was a Little girl.

14:40.262 --> 14:45.700
And I learned to play the ukulele
in one of my Last films, <i>Not So Tiny Tim</i>.

14:45.868 --> 14:48.302
And based on that, my world opened up...

14:48.470 --> 14:52.304
...because I was invited to join the
re-formed New Main Street Singers.

14:52.474 --> 14:58.344
And that's where I met my man,
and before Long I was the new Mrs. Bohner.

14:58.514 --> 15:00.243
Ain't that something?

15:00.416 --> 15:02.008
-A beautiful story.
-I tell you.

15:03.285 --> 15:05.845
Last week you were
going to come in at 5...

15:06.021 --> 15:09.047
...and you never showed up.
It's okay, it's just that--

15:09.224 --> 15:10.885
-He's in. Mitch is in.
-Really?

15:11.060 --> 15:13.392
-It's unbelievable.
-Congratulations!

15:13.562 --> 15:16.725
-Thank you. Thank you.
-He said he would be a part of this?

15:16.899 --> 15:19.265
-Yes.
-He said that just now on the phone?

15:19.435 --> 15:22.802
-Yeah, I think he did.
-Did he put it in writing?

15:23.906 --> 15:26.466
I'm sorr--
I'm just looking out for you.

15:26.642 --> 15:29.770
Let's not rain on the parade, okay?
He's in.

15:30.713 --> 15:35.241
In 1974, after the breakup,
Mitch was extremely angry.

15:35.784 --> 15:37.615
His first solo album...

15:37.886 --> 15:41.287
...a <i>Cry For Help</i>, contained
numbers Like "If I Had A Gun" ...

15:42.925 --> 15:46.361
..."Anyone But You," "May She Rot in Hell."

15:46.528 --> 15:50.794
And this just spiraled down...

15:50.966 --> 15:53.366
...to the next album, <i>Calling It Quits</i>.

15:55.504 --> 15:58.701
And at that point he was in a very bad way.

16:18.961 --> 16:23.489
There was a lot of anger in Mitch...

16:27.169 --> 16:30.070
...for reasons, you know, that he had.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.799
I think he went too soon.

16:34.309 --> 16:38.336
He should have stayed longer,
because we really didn't get a grip on him.

16:40.883 --> 16:45.286
And his anger was unhealthy...

16:45.988 --> 16:48.684
...for all of us.

16:54.997 --> 16:56.828
-Hello, Mickey.
-Mitch.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.660
-How are you?
-Great.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.029
-It's good to see you.
-You too. So....

17:01.203 --> 17:05.105
-Mitch Cohen, this is my husband.
-Leonard Crabbe, very nice to meet you.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.935
-It's nice to meet you.
-Welcome to the house of Crabbe.

17:08.109 --> 17:11.876
Thank you very much.
I just checked into the hotel.

17:12.047 --> 17:15.346
Left my things there.

17:15.517 --> 17:17.416
-Good.
-Which hotel was that, then?

17:17.586 --> 17:20.146
I don't know the name.

17:20.422 --> 17:22.856
I can't remember the name,
but it's very nice.

17:23.025 --> 17:25.185
Are you hungry?

17:25.359 --> 17:27.294
-Yes.
-Good. Lunch is not quite ready.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.091
Maybe you'd Like to
take Mitch to see your trains?

17:30.265 --> 17:31.960
Oh, yes. Do you Like trains?

17:32.367 --> 17:34.198
I took a bus.

17:34.369 --> 17:38.305
No. Model trains.
Do you Like model trains?

17:38.941 --> 17:41.000
-Sure.
-It's a bit of a passion for me.

17:41.176 --> 17:43.667
I'll show you around.
It's right down here.

17:43.846 --> 17:47.509
-It was a 16-hour trip.
-This will be quicker than that.

17:54.389 --> 17:58.655
This whole area here is called Crabbe Town.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.921
We've got a brothel
down there above the saloon.

18:02.397 --> 18:06.493
And right down there, further along,
I'm thinking of building a French Quarter.

18:06.668 --> 18:12.903
-I've actually got a bit of French blood.
-I'd Love to see this town in the autumn.

18:13.809 --> 18:18.678
I think Crabbeville in autumn
would look quite magnificent.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.977
I would have made tiny Little leaves...

18:23.152 --> 18:27.248
...oak, poplar, maple, chestnut...

18:27.422 --> 18:33.258
...and spread them
across the town of Crabbeville.

18:33.896 --> 18:36.023
Magnificent.

18:37.833 --> 18:40.563
It's Crabbe Town, not Crabbeville.

18:54.683 --> 18:58.016
What is it you do, Leonard?

19:00.122 --> 19:01.555
For work?

19:01.990 --> 19:03.753
Oh, work.

19:03.926 --> 19:06.952
I'm in the bladder management industry.

19:07.129 --> 19:09.029
I sell catheters.

19:09.198 --> 19:13.464
I have my own distribution company.
Sure-Flo Medical Appliances.

19:13.635 --> 19:15.068
May have heard of it.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.866
It's actually named in tribute after
my mother. Her name was Florence.

19:19.041 --> 19:24.308
It's a growth industry, really,
because one in three people over 60...

19:24.479 --> 19:27.676
...either have a flaccid
or a spastic bladder...

19:28.217 --> 19:33.086
...so, in a sense, every 13.5 seconds,
a new incontinent is born, as it were.

19:33.822 --> 19:37.121
People Like you and I have
what they call "leakage problems."

19:37.292 --> 19:41.023
They can be running, playing tennis,
laughing, sneezing, anything.

19:41.196 --> 19:43.027
The good old constipation, you know?

19:43.198 --> 19:46.964
You have impacted fecal mass
in your rectum pushing on your bladder.

19:47.135 --> 19:50.866
This might make good dessert talk.

19:51.707 --> 19:56.804
I started playing folk clubs
in New York City...

19:56.979 --> 20:01.746
...and walked into one such
coffeehouse one night and there--

20:02.050 --> 20:06.544
-Half Moon Cafe.
-The Half Moon Cafe and--

20:06.722 --> 20:10.522
I was playing with my sisters,
Jocelyn, Claire, Estelle.

20:10.692 --> 20:12.387
We were the North Four.

20:12.561 --> 20:15.587
We were on-stage
and we had a horrible Little heckler.

20:15.764 --> 20:18.858
A Little guy, but with
the loudest voice in the world.

20:19.034 --> 20:24.563
And just, you know, "Take off your tops"
and "Get off the stage" ....

20:24.740 --> 20:29.336
"You sing Like crap! You get off the stage!"

20:29.511 --> 20:33.777
Very inarticulate. Rude.

20:33.949 --> 20:36.076
Mean. Mean Little bugger.

20:36.251 --> 20:39.778
ALL of a sudden, we couldn't see clear,
you got the lights on us...

20:39.955 --> 20:44.619
...but I see this tall, dark figure go over
and there's this intense Little...

20:44.793 --> 20:48.889
...something going on,
and all of a sudden, he's pummeled.

20:51.366 --> 20:53.834
-The crap pummeled out of him.
-I don't remember much.

20:54.002 --> 20:59.531
But the next thing I know,
I'm in a hospital, and the first thing I saw...

20:59.708 --> 21:06.170
...was a beautiful rose sitting in a vase
on the night table next to the bed.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.484
And I can't express...

21:09.651 --> 21:15.317
...what was surging through my body.

21:16.391 --> 21:19.417
I was consumed with an emotion...

21:19.594 --> 21:23.530
...that I had never felt before.

21:25.467 --> 21:27.958
We started singing together.

21:29.071 --> 21:32.563
We simply fused together...

21:32.741 --> 21:36.074
...in a very meaningful way.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.740
And before you know it, we were recording.

21:40.349 --> 21:42.840
-I Learned to sing with Mitch.
-And--

21:43.018 --> 21:46.613
So scary, so scary. But I just....

21:46.788 --> 21:50.053
Mitch was so strong and so smart
and knew what he wanted...

21:50.225 --> 21:53.126
...and I just focused on Mitch.

21:53.996 --> 21:56.157
You know,
I went along for the ride.

21:56.832 --> 21:58.800
<i>One, two, three, and....</i>

22:00.635 --> 22:05.231
-Wait. I doubled after you?
-No, with me. That's doubling.

22:05.407 --> 22:09.935
-You climb aboard the ferry at the same time.
-Okay, fair enough.

22:10.112 --> 22:12.046
One, two, three, and....

22:27.129 --> 22:30.530
<i>My mama was the cold north wind</i>

22:30.699 --> 22:35.329
<i>My daddy was the son of a railroad man</i>

22:35.504 --> 22:41.568
<i>From west of hell</i>
<i>Where the trains don't even run</i>

22:42.511 --> 22:46.003
<i>Never heard the whistle</i>
<i>Of a southbound freight</i>

22:46.181 --> 22:49.514
<i>Or the humming of its driving wheel</i>

22:49.684 --> 22:53.814
<i>No, I never did no wandering</i>

22:53.989 --> 22:57.982
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

22:58.160 --> 23:03.359
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

23:05.901 --> 23:12.306
I just, sorry, I just got a mental picture
in my mind of us on-stage in the show.

23:12.841 --> 23:18.211
And we weren't wearing the old stuff,
the old gear, the old....

23:18.380 --> 23:22.783
We're talking about the dickeys?
I think I'm on record as Mr. Anti-dickey.

23:22.951 --> 23:25.146
You were Mr. Drop-the-dickey.

23:25.320 --> 23:30.348
-It's just a very retro look.
-I'm totally available for the discussion of it.

23:30.525 --> 23:33.790
It sounds Like you're thinking
the image that we had...

23:33.962 --> 23:38.058
...was a retro image of something that
wasn't retro because we weren't retro...

23:38.233 --> 23:41.100
-...because we were then.
-It wasn't retro then...

23:41.269 --> 23:44.568
...but now, to try a retro thing,
it might just look kind of sad.

23:44.739 --> 23:47.139
-I mean....
-To do then now would be retro.

23:47.309 --> 23:51.245
To do then then
was very now-tro, if you will.

23:53.215 --> 23:57.413
I know we're getting emotional with things
and I know we want to give this...

23:57.586 --> 24:00.817
...to be a great thing for you know who,
but I'm Looking at numbers--

24:00.989 --> 24:04.117
For Dad. Can't you say it? For Dad.

24:05.227 --> 24:07.593
You can't say his name, can you?

24:07.762 --> 24:10.629
You're not the only one
that's thinking about Dad now.

24:10.799 --> 24:12.596
You're not the only person
going through this--

24:12.767 --> 24:16.965
You don't have to take everything personally.
It's not you. It's her. Forgive me.

24:17.139 --> 24:18.902
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Never mind.

24:19.074 --> 24:22.202
This isn't really just
a reunion for the folk groups.

24:22.377 --> 24:26.143
It's also a reunion for the Steinbloom family,
minus Dad, of course.

24:27.983 --> 24:31.077
-Because we never get together.
-Not really.

24:32.154 --> 24:36.318
-We talk. A Lot. We talk a Lot.
-We talk on the phone a Lot.

24:36.491 --> 24:40.120
-We don't really see each other.
-No. We don't need to.

24:40.295 --> 24:42.058
I moved away to North Dakota.

24:42.330 --> 24:45.629
I tried to get far away
to get the singing out of my head.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.567
I didn't care for folk music
and Dad knew that. I just didn't get it.

24:50.739 --> 24:54.072
So I haven't kept up our ties.
That's why this is kind of nice.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.904
Hopefully we can get
through our Little things...

24:57.078 --> 25:00.946
...and put on a good show for Dad.

25:01.116 --> 25:05.246
You Like to make amends, but you can't,
so we'll try to do it with one good--

25:05.420 --> 25:06.978
Music.

25:08.723 --> 25:10.452
You okay?

25:11.193 --> 25:14.390
Let's just hang on.

25:15.530 --> 25:17.225
Oh, Jesus.

25:31.479 --> 25:34.414
My dad, Fred Knox,
was an original Main Street Singer...

25:34.583 --> 25:36.551
...so I grew up with this kind of music.

25:39.221 --> 25:42.122
So I Listened to it when I was Little.

25:42.290 --> 25:46.249
But I didn't hear much of it when
I was a teenager because I was--

25:47.996 --> 25:50.191
I was on the streets.

25:50.365 --> 25:53.334
I was really rescued by
The New Main Street Singers...

25:53.501 --> 25:57.835
...and they really
gave me a break from that...

25:58.540 --> 26:00.735
...dark, that darkness.

26:00.909 --> 26:03.639
And....
So I Like to give people a break now.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.714
So when I sing, I want
to give out what was given to me.

26:07.882 --> 26:10.908
And I want to be, you know,
a vessel of Love...

26:11.086 --> 26:14.852
...and I want to entertain
and make people happy.

26:15.023 --> 26:20.154
So I Look for someone out in the audience
and that's what brings me real joy.

26:20.328 --> 26:23.786
So when Mr. Menschell
called me in 1995, my dad died...

26:23.965 --> 26:30.097
...and asked me to be a part
of this band, I said:

26:30.739 --> 26:32.673
"Well, yeah."

26:38.113 --> 26:41.947
<i>Going home</i>
<i>I'm going</i>

26:42.150 --> 26:44.550
<i>Go--</i>
<i>Going</i>

26:45.487 --> 26:47.387
<i>Go</i>

26:50.925 --> 26:56.227
<i>Going home</i>
<i>I'm going home</i>

26:58.033 --> 27:00.593
<i>Home</i>

27:07.676 --> 27:10.543
<i>Home</i>

27:12.681 --> 27:14.649
<i>Go--</i>

27:20.322 --> 27:24.349
Quick plugola, I'm Mike LaFontaine, owner
and founder of Hi-Class Management.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.723
Comic's constant companion.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.958
Let's start right out.
Hey, wha' happened?

27:33.134 --> 27:38.595
As you know, back in 1970....
I starred on a series called, <i>Wha' Happened.</i>

27:38.773 --> 27:41.799
Every time something would go wrong,
I'd Look at the camera and say:

27:41.976 --> 27:44.240
"Hey, wha' happened?"

27:44.412 --> 27:46.972
We had fun with that
and other catch phrases.

27:47.148 --> 27:49.548
"I got a real red wagon!"

27:49.718 --> 27:53.210
And, "I can't do my work!"

27:53.388 --> 27:58.325
And I believe I was the first one
to use the phrase, "I don't think so!"

27:58.493 --> 28:02.122
It lasted a year. That's good because
that's how you establish a cult.

28:04.666 --> 28:08.830
I was on-stage doing my shtick, "Hey,
wha' happened?" and "I can't do my work!"

28:09.003 --> 28:12.439
If someone would heckle me, they'd
say, "Will you be on-stage all night?"

28:12.607 --> 28:15.940
I would say, "That's right!"
and that would crack up the audience.

28:16.111 --> 28:20.172
But I noticed a guy sitting down front
with a Long face, nothing got to him.

28:20.348 --> 28:22.111
So I said to the lady next to him:

28:22.283 --> 28:25.980
"Hold your mirror up in front
of his nose to see if he's breathing.

28:26.154 --> 28:29.885
To see if there's a reflection."
So he started to smile.

28:30.058 --> 28:34.893
After the show I go down and introduce
myself. His name is George Menschell.

28:35.063 --> 28:38.055
He had been with a group called
The Main Street Singers.

28:38.233 --> 28:43.034
I was never into folk music.
I'd worked some bills with some folkies.

28:43.204 --> 28:46.605
<i>Put him in a cell with a long hose on him</i>
<i>Put him in a cell with a long hose on him</i>

28:46.775 --> 28:49.369
I used to say,
"If he's got a Long enough hose...

28:49.544 --> 28:52.138
...he's gonna have friends
in the shower room!"

28:53.214 --> 28:56.775
Folk audiences hated that joke.
But I said to George, I said:

28:56.951 --> 28:59.749
"Seriously, you've put up
some great numbers.

28:59.921 --> 29:04.381
If you re-form your group, I can send
you out on the Starfish Cruise Lines.

29:04.559 --> 29:07.653
Together, we could make a fortune
and you will have a ball."

29:07.829 --> 29:13.267
They used to go out, come back, they had
a great time. Except a couple of cruises...

29:13.435 --> 29:16.302
...dysentery broke out on the ship.
I was not there.

29:16.471 --> 29:19.668
You do not want to be on a cruise ship
when dysentery breaks out...

29:19.841 --> 29:23.242
...and knock on the men's room door,
"Will you be coming out soon?" ...

29:23.411 --> 29:25.709
...and hear, "I don't think so!"

29:26.581 --> 29:28.879
I'm so glad to be here.
I Love the network.

29:29.050 --> 29:31.484
I Love what you do here.
I watch it constantly.

29:33.655 --> 29:37.591
That's what I wanted to start by saying.
I think you're doing a fabulous job.

29:37.759 --> 29:41.217
And I'm very, very happy
to be here talking with you.

29:41.396 --> 29:44.024
It's a perfect fit.
Our demographics are skewing older...

29:45.700 --> 29:48.191
...and that can be a minus
with corporate underwriters.

29:48.369 --> 29:51.702
In this case, it's a plus because
of the built-in fans for The Folksmen...

29:51.873 --> 29:54.171
...all the groups
that your dad represented.

29:54.342 --> 29:59.109
And, you know, I think it's gonna
do very well in the evening hours...

29:59.280 --> 30:01.840
...which is when we'd propose
to do this concert.

30:02.016 --> 30:06.646
If you don't mind me saying, our audience
for some of these groups is getting younger.

30:06.821 --> 30:09.449
Not radically younger.
Which I hope is all right.

30:09.624 --> 30:13.321
If we can get two dozen young people
watching in the evening hours...

30:13.495 --> 30:17.556
...I think people here would be happy
because we don't have much of that now.

30:17.732 --> 30:20.200
This is great and I want to tell you...

30:20.368 --> 30:25.169
...if you're not weary of hearing stories about
your dad, I want to tell you a Little story.

30:25.340 --> 30:30.573
A young kid by the name of Lars Olfen,
in 1966, going to a concert.

30:30.745 --> 30:33.578
I'm 16 years old and it was raining.

30:33.748 --> 30:38.378
And I got right up to the box office
and Like some kind of practical joke...

30:38.553 --> 30:41.647
...the door slammed shut.
Sold out, right when I got there.

30:41.823 --> 30:45.782
My young tears mixed with the rain,
I'm walking away and I hear a voice.

30:45.960 --> 30:48.690
"Hey, kid, over here."
And I go, "What, a scalper?

30:48.863 --> 30:51.764
Who is this guy? I can't afford
that kind of money for a ticket."

30:51.933 --> 30:54.561
But he looks kind of familiar
and I go over there.

30:54.736 --> 30:57.671
He hands me two tickets,
doesn't want a dollar.

30:57.839 --> 31:01.206
It's your father. Why would he do that?

31:01.409 --> 31:04.606
That was Dad, you know.
He was just out there, with people.

31:04.779 --> 31:09.341
And he was generous, he was kind and
really that's why we're doing this thing...

31:09.517 --> 31:12.782
...to pay back this much back
to his memory.

31:12.954 --> 31:16.515
The <i>naches</i> I'm feeling right now.
Your dad was Like <i>mishpoche</i> to me.

31:16.691 --> 31:20.422
When I heard I got these tickets to
The Folksmen, I let out a <i>geshreeyeh</i>...

31:20.595 --> 31:23.223
...and I'm running with
my friend Like a <i>vilde chaye</i>...

31:23.398 --> 31:25.923
...right into the theater,
in the front row.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.364
We've got the <i>schpilkes</i>
because we're sitting right there.

31:28.536 --> 31:32.370
It's a <i>mitzvah</i> what your dad did,
and I want to try to give that back to you.

31:32.540 --> 31:35.065
<i>Okeinhoreh</i>, I say, and God bless him.

31:37.078 --> 31:40.047
Where did I go up? I remember hitting a....

31:40.214 --> 31:42.842
<i>We shared a song</i>

31:43.017 --> 31:45.884
I think it might be on "the ravens,"
on "the ravens."

31:46.054 --> 31:48.579
"We shared."
I think you might stay below me on--

31:48.756 --> 31:50.781
Stay on: <i>We shared</i>

31:50.959 --> 31:52.551
<i>Wandered</i>

31:52.727 --> 31:57.221
<i>Wandered through each other's secrets</i>

31:57.398 --> 31:59.866
<i>We traded</i>

32:01.269 --> 32:02.634
<i>We traded</i>

32:02.804 --> 32:06.706
You're right! Mitch, you're right!
Oh, I forgot that.

32:06.874 --> 32:12.107
<i>We traded an honored worth</i>

32:16.250 --> 32:18.377
That's it, nice and crisp!

32:18.553 --> 32:20.487
That's very nice.

32:20.655 --> 32:24.557
<i>Walking down to Main Street</i>
<i>Everybody's gonna sing</i>

32:24.726 --> 32:26.216
There you go.

32:30.298 --> 32:33.199
What are you singing there?
You got the root on "sing"?

32:33.368 --> 32:34.733
You singing the root?

32:34.902 --> 32:38.030
No, I was singing:
<i>Everybody's gonna sing</i>

32:38.206 --> 32:40.333
Didn't I give you a sixth?

32:40.575 --> 32:43.169
-I don't think so.
-Tony, I give him a sixth?

32:43.344 --> 32:45.244
I think you were singing the sixth.

32:45.413 --> 32:47.973
-Can you sing me a sixth?
-Could you sing a sixth?

32:48.149 --> 32:50.344
<i>-Everybody gonna sing</i>
<i>-Everybody gonna sing</i>

32:50.518 --> 32:54.010
-Yeah, I can sing that. Sure.
-Let's try it again. One, two, three.

32:54.622 --> 32:56.419
What? Yeah?

32:56.591 --> 32:58.855
-Go ahead.
-You have a problem in the bridge?

32:59.027 --> 33:00.289
No, I was gonna--

33:00.461 --> 33:02.861
Can I switch?
Can I change out of my costume?

33:03.064 --> 33:05.430
Costume? Are you hot?

33:05.600 --> 33:08.194
Yeah. But also, I mean...

33:08.369 --> 33:10.166
...I've been wearing it for a month.

33:10.338 --> 33:11.862
You know the policy.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.441
We all gotta wear the uniform
until we're ready to take it off.

33:15.610 --> 33:18.374
You're close, I just don't think
you're quite there yet.

33:18.546 --> 33:21.947
You did not sing that sixth,
and I want to see you sing that sixth.

33:22.116 --> 33:24.482
You just wear what you have on.
You sound fine.

33:24.652 --> 33:28.315
Eventually you'll be able to wear
your civvies when you're singing.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.921
Jonathan? Hi.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.583
Well, I got good news and better news.

33:33.761 --> 33:39.461
Good news is, we're still doing the concert.
The better news is, we are going live.

33:39.634 --> 33:41.101
Yeah.

33:41.269 --> 33:45.262
I got a friend, at NO AA, so we're going up
in the Nimbus 7 Oceanographic Satellite.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.739
He's got some bandwidth there,
and it's Live!

33:48.910 --> 33:51.811
Yeah, the corporate underwriters
wouldn't go for it, so....

33:53.681 --> 33:56.411
I'm excited too!

33:57.385 --> 33:59.649
Okay. Okay.

33:59.821 --> 34:01.345
<i>Shalom.</i>

34:01.522 --> 34:03.717
<i>Folk music is in my blood.</i>

34:04.092 --> 34:09.223
As a young boy, in Sweden-- I was born
there and came here at an early age...

34:09.397 --> 34:13.128
...but we'd go back to Sweden every
year, my family and I, in the winter...

34:13.301 --> 34:15.768
...which was a flip from the normal thing.

34:15.937 --> 34:20.135
Every Olfen kid, Lars, Sven, Pippi
and Liv, was trained on the dulcimer.

34:20.308 --> 34:24.870
When you could hold a rattle, you'd
hold a dulcimer. And we Learned to play.

34:25.045 --> 34:29.346
I had a garage band in Stockholm,
which was a challenge in its own right...

34:29.516 --> 34:32.110
...to keep an instrument tuned
with that temperature swing.

34:32.286 --> 34:35.016
There's a block warmer
for the Volvo in the garage...

34:35.188 --> 34:37.657
...but it's cold in there in the winter.

34:37.824 --> 34:40.521
So we played and I had a hit
that you might have heard of.

34:41.896 --> 34:45.696
Which means, "How's It Hanging, Grandma?"
and it was big on the Swedish charts.

34:45.867 --> 34:50.304
I got in touch with the American music.
I Loved that and thrived on that...

34:50.471 --> 34:53.634
...so I came here
and became part of that scene.

34:53.808 --> 34:58.302
I'm so happy to be here and come
full circle, airing this show on PBN.

34:58.479 --> 35:00.379
It's a dream come true.

35:00.548 --> 35:04.712
<i>I worked the fields my father worked</i>

35:04.886 --> 35:07.514
<i>From dawn till setting sun</i>

35:07.688 --> 35:08.916
Then it quiets down.

35:09.090 --> 35:12.719
<i>And the skeletons of Quinto</i>

35:12.894 --> 35:15.522
<i>Call me home</i>

35:21.536 --> 35:24.801
"The silver tentacles of the moon's rays
haunt me...."

35:24.972 --> 35:28.237
That's really getting confusing.
It's really confusing.

35:28.409 --> 35:32.709
It's really confusing. I'm hearing you
the same timbre, and it's cluttered.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.906
Maybe if I did it higher
and he did it lower--

35:36.083 --> 35:41.612
-If you do what you did before.
-I can't get that much higher.

35:41.789 --> 35:45.520
But that's-- Now it sounds
almost more Like a ventriloquist.

35:45.693 --> 35:49.424
Can I make the radical suggestion
that maybe this is not the best number...

35:49.597 --> 35:53.363
...to start with?
This is a Live television show.

35:53.534 --> 35:56.230
We don't want people
to reach for their remotes here.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.372
It's public television.
I don't think....

35:58.539 --> 35:59.972
-They don't have remotes.
-Yeah.

36:01.676 --> 36:05.544
<i>My God, that's terrible. What do you mean</i>
<i>he won't come out of the room?</i>

36:05.713 --> 36:09.774
Have you talked to him? Has he talked to
a doctor? Have you given him medication?

36:09.951 --> 36:13.182
I know he's anxious.
I'm always anxious. I come out.

36:13.354 --> 36:15.845
You know, I mean,
we gotta do something.

36:16.023 --> 36:19.117
You want me to-- You mean,
I'm supposed to talk to him?

36:19.293 --> 36:22.126
I Like him, I don't have that much
to say to him.

36:22.296 --> 36:25.390
I could be empathetic.
I'm not sure what else I could do.

36:25.566 --> 36:28.592
I could sit, I could try.
Anything, we have to do something.

36:28.769 --> 36:33.570
I'LL talk to him. I'm happy to.
I gotta get him out of there.

36:33.741 --> 36:38.371
We're not broadcasting from a motel room.
We gotta get him out of there.

36:39.046 --> 36:42.277
<i>What's happening here?</i>
<i>Could you run your hand over that?</i>

36:42.717 --> 36:46.380
-What are you getting?
-Well, I'm getting a bounce.

36:46.554 --> 36:49.045
But there's a lightness within it, as well.

36:49.223 --> 36:53.057
Interesting. You know, honey,
it's a very tricky color.

36:53.227 --> 36:57.220
<i>Terry and I worship</i>
<i>an unconventional deity.</i>

36:57.398 --> 37:00.390
The power of another dimension.

37:00.902 --> 37:05.839
Now, you're not going to read about this
dimension in a book, or in a magazine...

37:06.007 --> 37:07.565
...or in a newspaper...

37:07.742 --> 37:10.643
...because it doesn't exist anywhere...

37:10.811 --> 37:13.302
...except in my own mind.

37:14.148 --> 37:17.777
Through our ceremonies and our rituals...

37:17.952 --> 37:20.614
...we have witnessed firsthand...

37:20.788 --> 37:25.384
...the awesome
and vibratory power of color.

37:26.694 --> 37:29.458
We experience it as alive...

37:29.630 --> 37:33.259
...and constantly shaping
our experience.

37:33.434 --> 37:37.734
And we believe that
this saturated energy...

37:37.905 --> 37:42.535
...is the basis of all creation.

37:42.710 --> 37:47.170
We are WINC. W-I-N-C.

37:47.348 --> 37:51.842
Witches In Nature's Colors. WINC.

37:54.355 --> 37:58.724
<i>The word "witch " may be a problem for</i>
<i>some of you. It has silly connotations.</i>

37:58.893 --> 38:03.762
No, we do not ride around
on broomsticks and wear pointy hat--

38:03.931 --> 38:06.092
Well, we don't ride on broomsticks.

38:06.467 --> 38:08.628
This is not an occult science.

38:08.803 --> 38:12.967
This is not one of those crazy systems...

38:13.140 --> 38:15.540
...of divination and astrology.
That's hooey...

38:15.710 --> 38:18.645
...and you gotta have a screw loose
to go in for it.

38:18.813 --> 38:23.147
Our beliefs are fairly commonplace
and simple to understand.

38:23.317 --> 38:26.650
Humankind is simply materialized color...

38:26.821 --> 38:30.086
...operating on the 49th vibration.
You'd make that conclusion...

38:30.257 --> 38:32.782
...walking down the street
or going to the store.

38:33.995 --> 38:36.964
<i>I know this is a lot of pressure</i>
<i>for you to be under.</i>

38:37.131 --> 38:40.760
And I don't want you to feel you have
to push yourself too far. Okay?

38:40.935 --> 38:43.426
This is a one-day-at-a-time kind of thing.

38:43.604 --> 38:46.573
Don't think you have to achieve anything
right away.

38:46.741 --> 38:50.268
Very important to back off the pressure.
Okay?

38:50.444 --> 38:54.574
There's a deception here.
The audience...

38:55.216 --> 38:59.084
...they're expecting to see a man
who no Longer exists.

38:59.253 --> 39:01.778
Well, you know, that may be true.

39:03.157 --> 39:05.955
It might indeed be true.

39:06.127 --> 39:07.754
But I think what you have--

39:08.496 --> 39:10.862
-Oh, baby.
-Oh, baby.

39:13.401 --> 39:15.426
Can I--?

39:27.581 --> 39:29.242
<i>Loco man</i>

39:29.417 --> 39:32.477
<i>Watching all the fish swim away</i>

39:33.087 --> 39:36.454
<i>He no work</i>
<i>He just sleep and play</i>

39:36.624 --> 39:39.058
<i>Sitting here on the sand</i>

39:39.226 --> 39:41.660
Talking about the <i>loco</i> man.

39:41.829 --> 39:43.490
<i>Sunny land</i>

39:43.664 --> 39:47.156
<i>Coconut coming down all the time</i>

39:47.334 --> 39:49.802
<i>Milk, she sweeter than honey wine</i>

39:50.838 --> 39:53.466
<i>Sitting here on the sand</i>

39:56.210 --> 39:58.872
<i>Sun breaks over the sprits'l yard</i>

40:00.214 --> 40:04.014
<i>Jib sheets hauling to leeward hard</i>

40:04.185 --> 40:06.915
<i>Crosstrees humming a morning hymn</i>

40:07.488 --> 40:11.254
<i>-I'm the cabin boy, call me Jim</i>
<i>-His name's Jim</i>

40:11.492 --> 40:13.687
<i>Fare away, fare away</i>
<i>Under main top sail</i>

40:13.861 --> 40:17.262
<i>To the furbelow of the wily whale</i>

40:17.431 --> 40:21.265
Hold on. One second, please.
I got an idea. Very literate reference.

40:21.435 --> 40:25.098
Are you familiar with a book about
a pirate captain, his name is Moby Dick?

40:25.272 --> 40:26.967
He was chasing some big whale.

40:27.141 --> 40:30.474
He had a catch phrase he'd always
yell out, "There she blows!"

40:30.644 --> 40:34.774
If you could do that, we'd have someone
off-stage drench the group with water.

40:34.949 --> 40:38.407
And you could Look at the camera
and say, "Hey, wha' happened?"

40:38.586 --> 40:40.850
And every time,
another thing of water....

40:41.021 --> 40:43.956
And by the end you're all soaked,
even the ladies....

40:47.461 --> 40:51.329
At the end of the song you turn the
guitars over and water splashes out.

40:51.499 --> 40:53.490
Kerplunk!

40:53.667 --> 40:54.895
It's just a thought.

40:55.069 --> 41:00.439
<i>Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted</i>

41:00.608 --> 41:05.807
<i>And the fairy tales have all been told</i>

41:05.980 --> 41:11.509
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

41:11.685 --> 41:16.588
<i>More precious than a pot of gold</i>

41:17.124 --> 41:21.788
<i>My sweet, my dear, my darling</i>

41:21.962 --> 41:26.262
<i>You're so far away from me</i>

41:27.501 --> 41:32.131
<i>Though an ocean of tears divides us</i>

41:32.306 --> 41:37.471
<i>Let the bridge of our love span the sea</i>

41:43.350 --> 41:48.845
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

41:55.863 --> 42:02.291
<i>More precious than a pot of gold</i>

42:15.649 --> 42:18.083
<i>We're pleased to have</i>
<i>the folk people here tomorrow.</i>

42:18.252 --> 42:22.586
It's not something we usually do.
This is more of a classical venue.

42:22.756 --> 42:24.485
But it'll be a Lot of fun.

42:24.658 --> 42:27.320
It's Like having a carnival
come to town.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.528
I'm the events liaison.

42:31.031 --> 42:33.431
People here call me "King Larry"
or "Your Majesty" ...

42:33.601 --> 42:36.001
...because I do everything
that needs to be done.

42:36.170 --> 42:39.230
I've been up into the highest catwalk
changing light bulbs.

42:39.406 --> 42:42.637
I've been in the basement
changing the rat traps.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.334
I'm also a singer.

42:44.511 --> 42:47.639
I'm not a professional,
but I do Like to sing in church...

42:47.815 --> 42:50.978
...and, you know,
places Like juvenile halls.

42:51.151 --> 42:52.914
But this....

42:53.754 --> 42:57.121
This is the best place to sing in
New York and possibly the world.

42:57.291 --> 42:59.225
The acoustics are just perfect.

43:23.613 --> 43:26.104
-Did I miss it?
-No. It's about a mile.

43:26.282 --> 43:30.013
-I'm not sure if I'm going north or south.
-Where is it again?

43:30.186 --> 43:32.950
The guy said Midtown.
He said you can't miss it.

43:33.122 --> 43:36.455
-It has chrome on the front of the hotel.
-You wanna hang a Left.

43:36.626 --> 43:38.787
-I'm gonna make a Left.
-Try again.

43:38.961 --> 43:43.728
-Do you have a map?
-I have a map, but not in the car.

43:44.333 --> 43:47.029
Were you planning to study it later
academically, or...?

43:47.203 --> 43:50.969
-Is it on the way?
-Look, guys, I'LL get us here.

43:51.140 --> 43:53.074
Nobody's busting your chops. Yet.

43:53.242 --> 43:56.643
-It's just a question of time.
-Pull over and Let me drive.

43:56.813 --> 43:59.247
I don't want you to.
I don't know where I am.

43:59.415 --> 44:01.781
<i>We're excited to be involved</i>
<i>with this project.</i>

44:01.951 --> 44:05.045
It will be a challenge for me
because I'm not a fan of folk music.

44:07.190 --> 44:09.055
-Me too!
-I could care less about it.

44:09.225 --> 44:12.626
But that doesn't matter
in the business of public relations...

44:12.795 --> 44:15.093
...which is what we do.

44:15.264 --> 44:19.030
It matters what you think. And it
matters what we can make you think.

44:19.202 --> 44:20.897
What we can sell to you.

44:21.070 --> 44:25.871
And a product you'll Love to buy.
That's the way we Look at this concert.

44:26.042 --> 44:28.067
And if we can't do that, we fake it.

44:28.244 --> 44:30.439
That's also part of public relations.

44:30.613 --> 44:34.606
We're professionals here, you see.
We get ideas that help sell.

44:34.784 --> 44:37.617
We work together very well.

44:37.787 --> 44:41.746
It's almost as Like we have one brain...

44:41.924 --> 44:43.448
...that we share between us.

44:43.860 --> 44:48.820
It's Like I'LL have an idea, it will
just be a teeny, tiny Little spark...

44:48.998 --> 44:53.697
...and then it will get to Wally
and he'll make it a fire.

44:54.770 --> 44:58.467
I don't know about you,
but I'm predicting a Lot of exciting...

44:58.641 --> 45:01.940
...amazing things
that happen to the groups.

45:02.111 --> 45:06.980
Like big, Like, not just big,
but big-time stuff.

45:07.583 --> 45:11.417
Ladies and gentlemen, as deputy mayor,
it gives me no greater pleasure...

45:11.587 --> 45:14.021
...than to officially declare tomorrow...

45:14.190 --> 45:16.658
...Saturday, June 22...

45:16.826 --> 45:19.818
...Folk Music Day in the Big Apple.

45:19.996 --> 45:22.294
Thank you.

45:26.536 --> 45:29.664
Thank you very much, Your Honor,
or Your deputy Honor.

45:29.839 --> 45:33.104
I have two questions.
One, is New York City ready to hear...

45:33.276 --> 45:37.610
...a rebirth of some of the finest
folk music ever created in this city?

45:37.780 --> 45:39.247
Yes, I think so!

45:40.716 --> 45:44.277
And my second question is, where's
the real mayor? Wha' happened?

45:44.453 --> 45:47.115
Someone shot the mayor,
they did not shoot the deputy.

45:47.290 --> 45:51.556
The DA's office called. They can't find
any witnesses, so he's in the clear.

45:51.727 --> 45:54.696
Let me say a few words
about The New Main Street Singers.

45:54.864 --> 45:58.994
One of the founding members has passed
away, but he's with us tonight anyway!

45:59.168 --> 46:03.537
George Menschell! Come on up here
and say something, George.

46:03.706 --> 46:07.540
How are you? You wanna say something?
Come on, say something!

46:07.710 --> 46:09.371
Thank you sincerely, Your Honor...

46:09.545 --> 46:12.912
...which reminds me, I was at
a swingers party and a guy said to me:

46:13.082 --> 46:16.609
"I'd Like to meet your wife."
I said, "Your honor!"

46:16.786 --> 46:19.812
To paraphrase an old joke:
Knock, knock. Who's there?

46:19.989 --> 46:24.858
It's The New Main Street Singers!
Thank you so much.

46:27.196 --> 46:29.596
-Thank you. You can take this.
-Okay.

46:29.765 --> 46:32.757
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

46:34.203 --> 46:35.795
Don't forget to buy the CDs.

46:35.972 --> 46:38.372
<i>Seeing these long lines of fans...</i>

46:38.541 --> 46:41.942
<i>...who want nothing more than</i>
<i>to have you sign an autograph...</i>

46:42.111 --> 46:44.705
...it's Like it's 1968...

46:44.880 --> 46:48.247
...or '67, or '66.

46:49.785 --> 46:51.309
The good years.

46:51.487 --> 46:54.012
It's so wonderful to see the people...

46:54.190 --> 46:57.091
...that have enjoyed your music
all these years.

46:57.260 --> 46:58.750
And there's so many of them.

46:58.928 --> 47:02.193
And they just want to shake your hand
and say:

47:03.266 --> 47:05.962
"We dig what you do."

47:06.135 --> 47:09.002
And then there's the kids.
We're hearing, "You rock."

47:09.171 --> 47:13.107
"You rock me."
"You rock my world." What--?

47:13.276 --> 47:18.407
I was flashing back to the rush
of adrenaline we used to get...

47:18.581 --> 47:20.674
...arriving at the concert hall...

47:20.850 --> 47:24.946
...having stagehands saying,
"Good show, Mitch."

47:25.121 --> 47:27.555
"Good luck, Mickey, tonight."

47:27.723 --> 47:32.126
And we'd wait backstage,
hearing the crowd chanting.

47:32.361 --> 47:36.388
"Mickey, Mickey, Mitch, Mitch!"

47:36.732 --> 47:39.428
Walking out into the spot...

47:39.602 --> 47:43.698
...the sound of the crowd cheering...

47:43.873 --> 47:46.808
...the decibel Level.

47:49.145 --> 47:51.613
For me it was just watching you.

47:52.048 --> 47:56.109
Because I couldn't think about me
actually being up there. Watching you.

47:56.285 --> 47:58.879
I Look forward to that, Mitch.

47:59.055 --> 48:02.388
-I wonder if it'll happen tomorrow night.
-Oh, yeah.

48:02.558 --> 48:04.025
-And I'LL be there.
-We'll see.

48:04.193 --> 48:06.593
I'LL be there in the best seat in the house.

48:14.737 --> 48:18.036
I guess you can make money
in folk music.

48:18.207 --> 48:20.801
-Yeah, I guess you can.
-Yeah.

48:20.976 --> 48:26.209
It's usually because of acts
Like The New Main Street Singers.

48:26.382 --> 48:29.647
That commercial crapola.

48:31.087 --> 48:33.647
I'm a model train enthusiast.

48:34.290 --> 48:37.157
Oh, that's great!

48:38.694 --> 48:43.688
I've got a whole layout in my basement.
It's very much a big passion for me.

48:44.266 --> 48:47.235
Yeah, thank God for model trains.

48:47.403 --> 48:49.667
-Absolutely.
-If they didn't have model trains...

48:49.839 --> 48:54.276
...they wouldn't have
gotten the idea for the big trains.

48:55.478 --> 48:57.605
Excuse me. Hi.

48:57.780 --> 49:00.010
Hi, everybody. Just be a second.

49:00.182 --> 49:03.811
Don't want to interrupt.
We're having a great time.

49:03.986 --> 49:07.513
I'd Like to propose a big, big toast...

49:07.690 --> 49:10.250
...in honor of Dad.

49:10.426 --> 49:13.122
He was an amazing
and a wonderful, loving father...

49:13.662 --> 49:16.290
...a fantastic person in general.

49:16.465 --> 49:19.434
And I think anybody who even knew Dad
just for a second...

49:19.602 --> 49:22.628
...knew that he had an amazing hum.

49:22.805 --> 49:27.265
And wherever he went,
he would suddenly break into a hum.

49:27.443 --> 49:30.901
And anybody who heard this hum
would just be happy.

49:31.080 --> 49:34.811
And in honor of Dad,
I'd Like to say, Let's all pause...

49:34.984 --> 49:39.250
...Let's raise our glasses
and Let's hum for Dad.

49:56.605 --> 49:58.937
<i>Okay, bring it down. Back up.</i>

49:59.408 --> 50:02.002
Okay, bring it across. Bring it across.

50:02.178 --> 50:04.840
-Right on down here.
-Here, hold it.

50:07.850 --> 50:10.341
-So, what do you got? You got vocal?
-Vocal.

50:10.519 --> 50:14.455
-Some of them are already in there.
-They've been assigned directions?

50:14.623 --> 50:18.115
Yeah. We do this every single day.
This is just Like clockwork.

50:18.294 --> 50:21.058
-Those are microphones?
-Microphone stands.

50:21.230 --> 50:23.858
-They don't have tops on them.
-Pardon?

50:24.033 --> 50:28.060
They'll have tops when we're done,
don't worry. We do this every day.

50:28.237 --> 50:29.397
Mike heads.

50:29.572 --> 50:33.099
Would you call them a "mike head,"
or would it be the "mike"?

50:33.275 --> 50:36.540
It's called a microphone,
and you'll get them. Don't worry.

50:36.712 --> 50:38.703
-We really want them.
-You'll have them.

50:56.499 --> 51:00.833
<i>Town hall. Tonight.</i>
<i>Mitch and Mickey at the Town Hall.</i>

51:01.136 --> 51:05.596
Two weeks rehearsal.
That's the way to play Town Hall.

51:05.774 --> 51:09.301
Crazy. New phrasing. Different keys.

51:10.379 --> 51:12.973
But couldn't have happened
any other way.

51:13.148 --> 51:16.117
If we'd stayed together,
we wouldn't be at Town Hall now.

51:16.285 --> 51:20.381
We'd be lucky to be in Branson,
opening for The Main Street Singers.

51:20.556 --> 51:22.114
Nope.

51:22.291 --> 51:25.988
This was our crazy way of getting here.

51:27.930 --> 51:30.490
<i>Well, I'm feeling very relaxed.</i>

51:30.666 --> 51:33.999
<i>Very confident. Very focused.</i>

51:34.937 --> 51:38.498
You know, 35 years ago,
preparing for a concert...

51:38.674 --> 51:43.077
...meant playing "find the cobra"
with a hotel chambermaid.

51:43.245 --> 51:47.739
But tonight, I feel good.
I feel excited.

51:48.083 --> 51:50.984
I feel ready for whatever
the experience is...

51:51.153 --> 51:54.919
...that we will take with us
after the show.

51:55.090 --> 51:58.924
I'm sure it will be an adventure...

51:59.094 --> 52:02.586
...a voyage on this magnificent vessel...

52:02.765 --> 52:05.325
...into uncharted waters.

52:05.501 --> 52:08.993
What if we see sailfish jumping...

52:09.171 --> 52:14.939
...and flying across the magnificent orb
of a setting sun?

52:15.110 --> 52:17.135
I think it's impeccable.

52:17.313 --> 52:20.248
It says happiness, it says opening night.

52:20.416 --> 52:24.716
It says, "I Love folk music but I'm not
afraid of classical." It's beautiful.

52:24.887 --> 52:28.516
I'm a Little afraid of these
pokey things that are sticking out.

52:28.691 --> 52:31.285
-Apple blossoms.
-Is that what they're called?

52:31.460 --> 52:36.557
They're at eye height. Someone
could come over to sniff, admire...

52:36.732 --> 52:39.166
...and poke an eye out.
I'd Love to clip it off.

52:39.335 --> 52:43.101
If we could get a shape to them,
that's my basic creative issues.

52:43.272 --> 52:46.070
I have a health and safety issue.
Those viny things.

52:46.241 --> 52:49.267
They're a disaster.
They're too low, too tangy.

52:49.445 --> 52:52.778
They're just waiting for
an elderly person to wheel by...

52:52.948 --> 52:56.281
...or somebody in a walker,
or with a brace on their leg.

52:56.452 --> 52:59.182
A Lot of my family
is beyond old, and--

52:59.355 --> 53:04.224
I've got an idea. Let's get carnations
and a beer stein and put them up here.

53:04.393 --> 53:06.258
I don't see how that would work.

53:07.863 --> 53:10.127
<i>I've adopted the practice...</i>

53:10.299 --> 53:13.427
<i>...of taking care of my skin.</i>

53:13.602 --> 53:17.663
It's something, you know,
sometimes you get razzed a Little bit.

53:17.840 --> 53:22.971
I think Jerry was razzing me
the other day at Alan's house about it.

53:23.145 --> 53:25.409
He caught me in the bathroom...

53:25.581 --> 53:28.311
...and I did that thing where
I put my hands down fast...

53:28.484 --> 53:32.113
...and he said, "What are you
doing there?" But really...

53:32.287 --> 53:36.519
...Norwegian fishermen have used
hand cream for centuries.

53:36.692 --> 53:39.388
And with that regimen,
and it's a very simple one...

53:39.561 --> 53:43.429
...I know that when I walk out
on-stage tonight, I will-- My skin...

53:43.599 --> 53:46.295
...will Look its best in front
of 2000 people.

53:46.468 --> 53:50.962
That will give me the confidence
that will help me to play my best...

53:51.140 --> 53:54.303
...and sing my best and be my best...

53:54.476 --> 53:57.775
...and you can't put a price on that.

53:58.480 --> 54:01.074
<i>-Tammy, we all set on the pre-record?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

54:01.984 --> 54:04.782
You know, I produced
a reunion show before.

54:04.953 --> 54:07.820
Before I came to PBN
I did the <i>Good Times</i> reunion.

54:07.990 --> 54:12.927
People wanted more close-ups. I want
to make sure we get plenty of close-ups.

54:13.095 --> 54:15.620
We have plenty of close-ups scheduled.

54:15.798 --> 54:19.461
Another great thing would be one
of those shots where you pull back...

54:19.635 --> 54:23.401
...to see the enormity
of the event and the venue.

54:23.572 --> 54:26.564
Would be a crane.
Do we have a crane standing by?

54:26.742 --> 54:29.108
-No, we don't have a crane.
-Wow!

54:29.278 --> 54:32.645
You know those swooping shots
where it goes over the audience...

54:32.815 --> 54:35.909
...and hammers in on a shot
of one of the musicians playing?

54:36.085 --> 54:37.814
-That would be great.
-It would be.

54:37.986 --> 54:41.649
Or when they pull back, kind of
Like a California Adventure ride...

54:41.824 --> 54:44.816
...where you see the whole thing,
that would be nice too.

54:44.993 --> 54:47.154
It would be.

54:47.996 --> 54:52.365
I could make some calls, if we could
get one. I don't know if it's too late.

54:52.534 --> 54:56.300
-ALL right, here's your giant banjo.
-It's very flat.

54:56.472 --> 54:58.633
It doesn't Look flat
from in the audience.

54:58.807 --> 55:01.537
It has basically no dimension to it.

55:01.710 --> 55:05.146
It's painted to Look three-dimensional.
If you go back there--

55:05.314 --> 55:09.751
But it's not painted on the back.
Will you Look with me for a minute?

55:09.918 --> 55:13.285
From the audience it will Look fine.
It Looks three-dimensional.

55:13.455 --> 55:14.922
Go out there and take a peek.

55:15.090 --> 55:18.082
Is this the real furniture
or the rehearsal furniture?

55:18.260 --> 55:20.353
It's not called "furniture."
It's a set.

55:20.529 --> 55:25.193
It's painted this way. It Looks completely
three-dimensional from the audience.

55:25.367 --> 55:28.564
So this is the real furniture,
and this is....

55:28.737 --> 55:32.104
-Is this an actual street lamp?
-I'm sure it was at one time.

55:32.274 --> 55:35.869
Can you have an actual
three-dimensional object...

55:36.044 --> 55:38.808
...that represents the thing
that it actually is, can that be next to...

55:38.981 --> 55:42.849
-...something that it's pretending to be?
-Yes, it's perfectly fine.

55:43.018 --> 55:46.977
I have no time to explain Stagecraft 101 .
This show starts in an hour.

55:47.156 --> 55:51.718
-Everything is exactly the way you--
-Those are Lights hanging up there?

55:51.894 --> 55:54.556
Those are Lights,
and that's a ceiling above us!

55:54.730 --> 55:57.358
-But they Look shaky.
-No, they're perfectly--

55:57.533 --> 56:00.001
Is that wire? I see a wire.
I see a--

56:09.978 --> 56:14.347
Fellas, thanks a Lot for coming
and doing this for Dad.

56:14.516 --> 56:16.211
Honestly, that's so beautiful.

56:16.385 --> 56:19.445
And thank you for the flowers,
the Little banjo.

56:19.621 --> 56:20.849
Did you Like that?

56:21.023 --> 56:24.151
We had to get rid of the lavender
because it attacked my eyes.

56:24.326 --> 56:27.022
-Sorry about that.
-Listen, the thought was wonderful.

56:27.196 --> 56:29.664
I remember you guys staying
at the house and....

56:29.832 --> 56:33.962
I remember you were always trying
to get a poker game started.

56:34.136 --> 56:39.768
You were, Like, 15 years old
with a deck of cards in your hands.

56:39.942 --> 56:41.239
-Penny stakes.
-Yeah.

56:41.410 --> 56:44.846
You always teased me with those
card games. You taught me cards.

56:45.013 --> 56:48.972
Yeah, we didn't know you were gonna
turn into a monster on us.

57:01.463 --> 57:03.397
Mitch.

57:03.565 --> 57:05.055
You okay?

57:05.234 --> 57:07.361
Yes.

57:24.720 --> 57:28.679
This flame, Like all flames,
represents the Light and the darkness.

57:28.857 --> 57:33.089
It also represents
the uncertainty of Life and its delicacy.

57:33.262 --> 57:35.696
It also represents a penis.

57:37.032 --> 57:41.332
<i>Red, orange, yellow, green, blue</i>

57:41.503 --> 57:46.497
<i>Indigo, violet</i>

57:47.309 --> 57:50.801
<i>-Ten seconds to air.</i>
<i>-Roll pre-record on my count.</i>

57:51.513 --> 57:52.912
Seven...

57:53.081 --> 57:55.811
...six, five, four...

57:56.418 --> 57:58.545
...three, two....

57:58.720 --> 58:01.052
Roll A. Fade up on A.

58:05.394 --> 58:08.659
<i>PBN New York is proud to present:</i>

58:08.830 --> 58:12.596
<i>Live from Town Hall,</i>
Ode to Irving...

58:12.768 --> 58:14.895
<i>...an evening of folk music.</i>

58:15.070 --> 58:17.937
<i>Featuring The New Main Street Singers...</i>

58:18.106 --> 58:22.338
<i>...The Folksmen and Mitch and Mickey.</i>

58:22.511 --> 58:27.915
<i>And now your host,</i>
<i>Mr. Jonathan Steinbloom.</i>

58:37.459 --> 58:40.519
Hello, I'm Jonathan Steinbloom,
and before we begin tonight...

58:40.696 --> 58:43.164
...I would Like to make
a brief announcement.

58:43.332 --> 58:47.826
I'd Like to warn you that some of the
floral arrangements here tonight...

58:48.003 --> 58:50.335
...have dangerously Low-hanging vines...

58:50.505 --> 58:53.440
...and may be poisonous,
so please, don't eat them.

58:53.608 --> 58:57.806
And don't become entangled in them
or trip, please.

59:04.720 --> 59:07.280
On behalf of the entire
Steinbloom family...

59:07.456 --> 59:10.892
...welcome to <i>Ode to Irving.</i>

59:12.828 --> 59:15.888
Thank you. Thank you.

59:16.465 --> 59:20.526
Please join all of us and give a really
warm welcome to our first group...

59:20.702 --> 59:22.693
...about whom Dad used to say...

59:22.871 --> 59:26.637
...they were the kind of infectious
that it was good to spread around.

59:26.808 --> 59:29.743
Ladies and gentlemen,
The New Main Street Singers.

59:49.131 --> 59:52.066
Thank you, New York City,
for that very warm welcome.

59:52.234 --> 59:55.726
Gee, I got a question.
Anybody care to hear some folk music?

59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.298
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

01:00:02.477 --> 01:00:06.208
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:12.047
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

01:00:14.423 --> 01:00:20.293
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

01:00:27.202 --> 01:00:29.864
<i>My mother was the cold north wind</i>

01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:34.404
<i>My daddy was the son of a railroad man</i>

01:00:34.576 --> 01:00:40.310
<i>From west of hell</i>
<i>Where the trains don't even run</i>

01:00:40.782 --> 01:00:43.876
<i>Never heard the whistle</i>
<i>Of a lonesome freight</i>

01:00:44.052 --> 01:00:46.919
<i>Or the singing of its driving wheel</i>

01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:49.614
<i>Oh, I never did no wandering</i>

01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:51.691
I didn't say a word.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.191
I don't know.

01:00:54.596 --> 01:00:59.590
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:03.497
<i>They say the highway's just one big road</i>

01:01:03.672 --> 01:01:06.937
<i>And it goes from here to there</i>

01:01:08.777 --> 01:01:12.269
You swear to God you didn't talk
to Menschell about the set?

01:01:12.447 --> 01:01:14.813
You didn't tell him
what we were opening with?

01:01:14.983 --> 01:01:18.111
I saw you talking to Terry Bohner.
Him and his blue sweater.

01:01:18.286 --> 01:01:20.618
I said, "Isn't it warm?"
Nothing about the set.

01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:23.383
Well, it's getting warmer now.

01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:28.461
I don't think finger-pointing
is gonna help us here. I....

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.021
-I think it's clear what we do.
-What?

01:01:31.199 --> 01:01:34.828
-I'm gonna suggest we be bold.
-Yeah, Let's hear it.

01:01:35.003 --> 01:01:37.767
We open with "Wandering."

01:01:38.773 --> 01:01:42.140
Did you miss the Last couple of minutes?
They're butchering--

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:45.040
-Turn it back up.
-We give the audience a choice.

01:01:45.213 --> 01:01:50.845
We say you can enjoy a toothpaste
commercial or hear folk music.

01:01:51.019 --> 01:01:54.580
They've brushed their teeth
by that time, it's not even germane.

01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:59.591
You can't have, especially on a folk bill,
two people doing the same song.

01:01:59.761 --> 01:02:02.992
That doesn't work.
They'll just be flat-out confused.

01:02:03.165 --> 01:02:08.068
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

01:02:08.236 --> 01:02:09.464
Easy now!

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:12.801
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

01:02:12.974 --> 01:02:15.704
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

01:02:15.877 --> 01:02:21.281
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

01:02:21.449 --> 01:02:25.579
<i>No, I never did no wandering</i>

01:02:25.754 --> 01:02:29.918
<i>After all</i>

01:02:40.502 --> 01:02:43.960
Oh, boy. Thank you very much!

01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:47.302
That song is so fun to sing.
I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.

01:02:47.676 --> 01:02:51.840
<i>Before we go a little bit further,</i>
<i>we'd like to introduce ourselves.</i>

01:02:52.013 --> 01:02:54.447
<i>Hi there, I'm Terry Bohner.</i>

01:02:59.054 --> 01:03:01.352
I'm going out for some air.

01:03:01.723 --> 01:03:03.281
Are you sure you're okay?

01:03:03.892 --> 01:03:05.985
Yes.

01:03:30.385 --> 01:03:32.546
<i>One night Mama went to fetch</i>
<i>Herself a sweet potato</i>

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.780
<i>Fell down the cellar stairs</i>

01:03:34.956 --> 01:03:36.947
<i>Stork dropped in</i>
<i>While she was on the floor</i>

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:39.218
<i>So my sister was born down there</i>

01:03:39.394 --> 01:03:43.660
<i>Daddy said this one will be nothing but a</i>
<i>Misery, never will be worth a damn</i>

01:03:43.832 --> 01:03:46.198
<i>But Mama just loved her</i>
<i>Little sweet potato baby</i>

01:03:46.368 --> 01:03:48.359
<i>With a face like a parboiled yam</i>

01:03:48.536 --> 01:03:50.800
<i>Come on, boys</i>
<i>Potato's in the paddy wagon</i>

01:03:50.972 --> 01:03:55.204
I know you don't want to hear this,
but it's a major key, it's up-tempo...

01:03:55.377 --> 01:03:57.743
...we open with "Old Joe's Place."

01:03:57.912 --> 01:04:01.348
We go out, do the song we're
known for, get it out of the way.

01:04:01.516 --> 01:04:03.848
And then, hey, here's the icing
on the cake.

01:04:04.019 --> 01:04:06.613
-What's the icing?
-The icing's the rest of the act.

01:04:06.788 --> 01:04:09.757
-That's the cake.
-No, that's the dressing.

01:04:09.924 --> 01:04:11.915
<i>Mom and Daddy put together</i>
<i>Quite a little posse</i>

01:04:12.093 --> 01:04:13.924
<i>Counting me and Jack and Cousin Will</i>

01:04:14.095 --> 01:04:18.293
<i>We all hopped into the old Chevy pickup</i>
<i>And we caught them at the top of the hill</i>

01:04:18.466 --> 01:04:20.798
<i>Daddy took his Remington</i>
<i>And shot away the lock</i>

01:04:20.969 --> 01:04:23.631
<i>For to set his little darling free</i>
<i>But Potato said</i>

01:04:23.805 --> 01:04:27.639
<i>Daddy, shut the goldarn door</i>
<i>Sheriff wants to marry me</i>

01:04:27.809 --> 01:04:29.936
<i>Let's go, boys</i>
<i>Potato's in the paddy wagon</i>

01:04:30.111 --> 01:04:32.102
<i>Guess we better leave her there</i>

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.510
<i>Let's go, boys</i>
<i>Potato's in the paddy wagon</i>

01:04:34.683 --> 01:04:39.017
<i>Mama says it's more than fair</i>
<i>Mama says it's more than fair</i>

01:04:59.074 --> 01:05:02.237
Ladies and gentlemen,
The New Main Street Singers.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:10.314
I have been watching and observing
as The New Main Street Singers....

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.487
Boy, that's fun! That's really fun, man.
How did we sound?

01:05:15.657 --> 01:05:19.320
-We weren't really listening.
-We were downstairs.

01:05:19.494 --> 01:05:22.986
I couldn't hear so well, but, shoot,
I'm sorry you guys--

01:05:26.101 --> 01:05:28.865
And now, please join me in welcoming
our next three talented performers.

01:05:29.037 --> 01:05:32.438
Taken alone they are merely
Jerry Palter...

01:05:32.607 --> 01:05:35.132
...Alan's Barrows and Mark Shubb.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:37.710
But when you put them all together...

01:05:37.879 --> 01:05:40.575
...they spell "absolutely fantastic."

01:05:41.082 --> 01:05:44.745
Ladies and gentlemen, The Folksmen!

01:05:52.827 --> 01:05:56.820
Thank you. Yeah, it's really us.

01:05:56.998 --> 01:05:58.522
-Wow.
-The waiting is over.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.292
Long time no see.

01:06:00.468 --> 01:06:01.696
Can't tell you.

01:06:02.003 --> 01:06:05.530
Great to be back.
We'd Like to do our hit.

01:06:07.475 --> 01:06:09.909
You might remember it,
we hope you do.

01:06:16.818 --> 01:06:20.982
<i>Whenever I'm out wandering</i>
<i>Chasing a rainbow dream</i>

01:06:21.156 --> 01:06:25.718
<i>I often stop and think</i>
<i>About a place I've never seen</i>

01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:29.990
<i>Where friendly folks can gather</i>
<i>And raise the rafters high</i>

01:06:32.834 --> 01:06:35.064
-Hey.
-Hey, pretty Lady!

01:06:35.236 --> 01:06:38.000
-You guys were great.
-Wonderful crowd.

01:06:38.173 --> 01:06:39.572
-Have you seen Mitch?
-No.

01:06:39.741 --> 01:06:41.834
Okay.

01:06:47.248 --> 01:06:49.273
Mitch?

01:06:52.086 --> 01:06:53.644
Pick it!

01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:57.781
That's nice.

01:07:01.796 --> 01:07:05.664
<i>Well, there's a puppy in the parlor</i>
<i>And a skillet on the stove</i>

01:07:05.834 --> 01:07:07.927
<i>And a smelly old blanket</i>
<i>That a Navajo wove</i>

01:07:08.102 --> 01:07:09.967
<i>There's popcorn in the popper</i>
<i>And a porker in the pot</i>

01:07:10.138 --> 01:07:12.129
<i>There's pie in the pantry</i>
<i>And the coffee's always hot</i>

01:07:42.737 --> 01:07:46.503
<i>Just look for the busted neon sign</i>
<i>That flashes</i>

01:07:46.674 --> 01:07:50.132
<i>Ea-a-oe's</i>

01:07:50.311 --> 01:07:54.304
<i>Well, there's a puppy in the parlor</i>
<i>And a skillet on the stove</i>

01:07:54.482 --> 01:07:56.473
<i>And a smelly old blanket</i>
<i>That a Navajo wove</i>

01:07:56.651 --> 01:07:58.380
<i>There's popcorn in the popper</i>
<i>And a porker in the pot</i>

01:07:58.553 --> 01:08:00.646
<i>There's pie in the pantry</i>
<i>And the coffee's always hot</i>

01:08:00.822 --> 01:08:02.653
<i>There's sausage in the morning</i>
<i>And a party every night</i>

01:08:02.824 --> 01:08:04.519
<i>There's a nurse on duty</i>
<i>If you don't feel right</i>

01:08:04.692 --> 01:08:08.128
<i>There's chicken on the table</i>
<i>But you gotta say grace</i>

01:08:08.897 --> 01:08:13.925
<i>There's always something cooking</i>
<i>At Old Joe's Place</i>

01:08:19.874 --> 01:08:21.102
Thank you!

01:08:21.276 --> 01:08:23.140
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you.

01:08:24.511 --> 01:08:28.004
Thank you very much.
Very nice of you.

01:08:28.182 --> 01:08:31.174
What a great crowd.
This crowd might want to join us...

01:08:31.352 --> 01:08:33.877
...in a Little audience participation.

01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:37.953
We're not gonna be
working up here by ourselves!

01:08:38.225 --> 01:08:41.593
First time through, relax.
Second time, we'll put you to work.

01:08:41.763 --> 01:08:44.390
We'll start off with
Mr. Alan's Barrows on the banjo.

01:08:57.078 --> 01:08:58.636
What?

01:08:58.813 --> 01:09:03.113
<i>Every morning at 5:00</i>
<i>The farmer jumps out of bed</i>

01:09:03.283 --> 01:09:07.448
<i>Washes up, he ties his shoes</i>
<i>Puts his hat upon his head</i>

01:09:07.622 --> 01:09:08.953
So far, so good.

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:11.625
-Ready, two.
-Two.

01:09:12.627 --> 01:09:15.460
-Ready, three, wide.
-Three.

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:18.656
Oh, my God. Mitch is gone.
He's just, he's gone.

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:21.393
Mitch is gone. Oh, my God.

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:24.435
Without Mitch, we got <i>gornisht</i>.
We have nothing.

01:09:24.606 --> 01:09:27.370
Well, we're gonna go find him.

01:09:29.911 --> 01:09:32.379
We'll need some chickens.
We got any chickens?

01:09:32.546 --> 01:09:34.707
How about this aisle?
Beyond this aisle.

01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:37.009
Just beyond the man with the big shirt.

01:09:37.185 --> 01:09:41.144
I want you to be my chickens.
I want to hear your best chicken sound.

01:09:41.322 --> 01:09:43.551
Pretty good. That's the ticket.
You got it.

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:46.694
Now we want to hear from
our horse people. This section.

01:09:46.861 --> 01:09:51.764
Not people with a sore throat,
people who can do a believable neigh!

01:09:53.768 --> 01:09:57.329
We're gonna put a saddle
on you folks. Not really.

01:09:57.805 --> 01:10:00.273
Does he have a cell phone or a pager?

01:10:00.441 --> 01:10:04.104
-He's wandering. He likes to wander.
-They go on in a couple of minutes!

01:10:04.278 --> 01:10:07.645
-He got a Little nervous.
-I don't need this <i>tsuris</i> in my Life.

01:10:07.815 --> 01:10:10.010
I'm sure it's fine. Let's calm down.

01:10:10.184 --> 01:10:14.018
-Is there a cockfight arena near here?
-She's joking, right?

01:10:14.188 --> 01:10:17.123
At least he's not lying on the ground
or anything.

01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:19.953
-Why didn't someone go out with him?
-What?

01:10:20.128 --> 01:10:22.653
-Can she do these songs solo?
-It's not my fault.

01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:25.355
<i>And the chickens cluck</i>

01:10:25.533 --> 01:10:28.229
<i>The horses neigh</i>

01:10:28.403 --> 01:10:30.371
<i>Crickets go fiddle-dee-dee</i>

01:10:31.506 --> 01:10:33.667
-Yes, they do.
<i>-And the bullfrogs croak</i>

01:10:35.243 --> 01:10:37.177
<i>The pigs oink, oink</i>

01:10:38.246 --> 01:10:43.411
<i>It's a barnyard symphony</i>

01:10:43.584 --> 01:10:45.711
-Thank you so much.
-Excellent.

01:10:45.887 --> 01:10:49.448
-Give yourselves a big hand.
-Give yourselves a big pat on the back.

01:10:49.624 --> 01:10:51.615
Thank you very, very much for coming.

01:10:51.793 --> 01:10:54.523
Thank you, Irv. Thanks for the good seats.

01:10:54.696 --> 01:10:58.530
We are The Folksmen. We hope
you've had a wonderful time tonight.

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:01.261
Thank you. Good night.

01:11:02.737 --> 01:11:06.696
We gotta give them more.
We have to give them more.

01:11:08.776 --> 01:11:10.903
Thank you for having us back.

01:11:11.079 --> 01:11:16.210
We have a song we'd Like to do
called "The Skeletons of Quinto."

01:11:16.384 --> 01:11:19.876
We don't often do encores,
and this is why.

01:11:21.122 --> 01:11:24.353
It has to do with a time
that I often think about...

01:11:24.525 --> 01:11:29.929
...when this time of year rolls around.
A time of conflict and bloodshed.

01:11:30.231 --> 01:11:32.131
The Spanish Civil War.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:37.237
But our group historian, Mr. Mark Shubb,
knows more about that than I do.

01:11:37.538 --> 01:11:39.369
Thank you very much, Alan's.

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:44.409
In the Late 1930s of the Last century,
Spain was wracked by civil war.

01:11:44.579 --> 01:11:47.844
What are you doing? Mitch could be
Lying face down in a ditch!

01:11:48.015 --> 01:11:51.507
-Would you consider doing both parts?
-No. I'd consider going home...

01:11:51.686 --> 01:11:55.383
...bake a nice tray of Nanaimo bars,
lie in bed, watch TV.

01:11:55.556 --> 01:11:57.217
That's what I Like doing!

01:11:57.391 --> 01:11:59.120
Mitch, where the hell were you?

01:11:59.293 --> 01:12:01.761
-Are we on?
-You've been on for five minutes.

01:12:01.929 --> 01:12:04.227
It's too Late. I forgot what a selfish--

01:12:04.398 --> 01:12:07.765
It just took me a while
to find a good one.

01:12:10.004 --> 01:12:12.905
-That is nice.
-It's nice.

01:12:17.578 --> 01:12:21.344
In the Late summer, early fall of 1938...

01:12:21.849 --> 01:12:24.613
...so the story goes
behind this particular song...

01:12:24.786 --> 01:12:28.119
...in the green hills
just outside the city of Bar--

01:12:29.757 --> 01:12:33.022
-Good night, everybody!
-Good night. Thank you very much.

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:49.798
They're called The Folksmen,
but after tonight's performance...

01:12:49.977 --> 01:12:53.208
...I think we're all going to have to
call them "The Spokesmen" ...

01:12:53.381 --> 01:12:58.182
...because they sing beautifully
and they tell a fascinating story.

01:12:58.352 --> 01:13:01.719
And now, Ladies and gentlemen,
I have two words for you:

01:13:02.156 --> 01:13:04.818
Mitch and Mickey.

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.133
We Love you!

01:13:26.714 --> 01:13:28.147
Thank you.

01:13:28.516 --> 01:13:31.883
Thank you so much
for letting Mitch and I do this again.

01:13:32.053 --> 01:13:35.648
It does not seem Like just yesterday
that Mitch and I met...

01:13:35.823 --> 01:13:38.656
...and started making music together.

01:13:38.826 --> 01:13:42.387
I don't know if any of you know
or would even remember...

01:13:42.563 --> 01:13:45.532
...that Mitch and I met in the hospital.

01:13:45.733 --> 01:13:49.396
Mitch was there
with his jaw wired shut...

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:54.007
...after defending the honor
of a girl he didn't even know.

01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:56.173
Me.

01:13:56.344 --> 01:13:59.939
And I, of course, was there to visit.
I felt really bad.

01:14:00.114 --> 01:14:05.552
And the only way that Mitch could
communicate with me was on paper.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.746
Every word of it poetry.
And if you don't mind, Mitch...

01:14:08.923 --> 01:14:11.756
...I have the very first poem...

01:14:11.926 --> 01:14:14.394
...that you wrote me.

01:14:16.564 --> 01:14:20.364
<i>Parched in exile</i>
<i>Thirsty for your smile</i>

01:14:20.534 --> 01:14:23.469
<i>Though silenced behind</i>
<i>This barbed-wire mask</i>

01:14:23.638 --> 01:14:26.300
<i>Your spirit burns through</i>
<i>That I might bask</i>

01:14:26.474 --> 01:14:30.205
<i>In your cool, misty loveliness</i>

01:14:34.215 --> 01:14:37.707
I just wanted a drink of water.

01:14:51.499 --> 01:14:57.563
<i>Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted</i>

01:14:57.872 --> 01:15:03.469
<i>And the fairy tales have all been told</i>

01:15:03.811 --> 01:15:08.748
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:11.976
I know this song.
This is that really pretty one.

01:15:12.153 --> 01:15:15.145
With the kiss.
Turn it up a Little bit.

01:15:18.459 --> 01:15:20.586
-Remember?
-Yeah. Where they used to....

01:15:20.761 --> 01:15:22.388
Yeah.

01:15:24.999 --> 01:15:27.467
Wonder how they're gonna handle that.

01:15:31.906 --> 01:15:38.311
-Five dollars says they do it.
<i>-And a kiss is the oath that they swear</i>

01:15:38.612 --> 01:15:44.482
<i>And when the veil of dreams has lifted</i>

01:15:44.652 --> 01:15:50.215
<i>And the fairy tales have all been told</i>

01:15:50.491 --> 01:15:56.191
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

01:15:56.697 --> 01:16:02.363
<i>More precious than a pot of gold</i>

01:16:02.536 --> 01:16:07.838
<i>My sweet, my dear, my darling</i>

01:16:08.009 --> 01:16:13.879
<i>You're so far away from me</i>

01:16:14.048 --> 01:16:19.247
<i>Though an ocean of tears divides us</i>

01:16:19.487 --> 01:16:25.255
<i>-Let the bridge of our love span the sea</i>
-Three. Twenty-two. Two.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.209
<i>Your kiss</i>

01:16:48.382 --> 01:16:54.787
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

01:17:14.875 --> 01:17:21.110
<i>More precious than a pot of</i>

01:17:21.982 --> 01:17:26.544
<i>Gold</i>

01:17:32.827 --> 01:17:34.692
Thank you.

01:17:35.029 --> 01:17:37.088
Thank you so much.

01:17:38.399 --> 01:17:39.832
Are you okay?

01:17:42.436 --> 01:17:44.836
Excuse me, sir. Sorry. Sorry.

01:17:45.973 --> 01:17:47.770
Hi, everybody!

01:17:49.844 --> 01:17:52.904
-Good to be back!
-Thank you.

01:17:53.747 --> 01:17:55.009
Thank you again.

01:17:55.883 --> 01:17:57.680
We're back!

01:17:58.018 --> 01:18:00.509
-"Mighty Wind."
-"Mighty Wind" in C.

01:18:01.288 --> 01:18:03.779
One in C. Here we go.

01:18:05.259 --> 01:18:06.749
One, two, three.

01:18:07.361 --> 01:18:12.230
<i>As I traveled down the back roads</i>
<i>Of this home I love so much</i>

01:18:12.399 --> 01:18:17.200
<i>Every carpenter and cowboy</i>
<i>Every lame man on a crutch</i>

01:18:17.371 --> 01:18:22.809
<i>They're all talking about a feeling</i>
<i>About a taste that's in the air</i>

01:18:22.977 --> 01:18:27.209
<i>They're all talking about this mighty wind</i>
<i>That's blowing everywhere</i>

01:18:27.481 --> 01:18:32.475
<i>Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>It's kicking up the sand</i>

01:18:32.653 --> 01:18:37.955
<i>It's blowing out a message</i>
<i>To every woman, child and man</i>

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:42.892
<i>Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>Cross the land and cross the sea</i>

01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:48.193
<i>It's blowing peace and freedom</i>
<i>It's blowing equality</i>

01:18:48.802 --> 01:18:53.330
<i>From a lighthouse in Bar Harbor</i>
<i>To a bridge called Golden Gate</i>

01:18:53.507 --> 01:18:57.671
<i>From a trawler down in Shreveport</i>
<i>To the shore of one Great Lake</i>

01:18:57.912 --> 01:19:03.908
<i>There's a star on the horizon</i>
<i>And it's burning like a flare</i>

01:19:04.084 --> 01:19:08.418
<i>It's lighting up this mighty wind</i>
<i>That's blowing everywhere</i>

01:19:08.589 --> 01:19:13.219
<i>Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>It's kicking up the sand</i>

01:19:13.394 --> 01:19:18.832
<i>It's blowing out a message</i>
<i>To every woman, child and man</i>

01:19:18.999 --> 01:19:24.198
<i>Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>Cross the land and cross the sea</i>

01:19:24.371 --> 01:19:29.536
<i>It's blowing peace and freedom</i>
<i>It's blowing equality</i>

01:19:29.743 --> 01:19:34.544
<i>When the blind man sees the picture</i>
<i>When the deaf man hears the word</i>

01:19:34.715 --> 01:19:39.209
<i>When the fisherman stops fishing</i>
<i>When the hunter spares the herd</i>

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:45.256
<i>We'll still hear the wondrous story</i>
<i>Of a world where people care</i>

01:19:45.426 --> 01:19:49.795
<i>The story of this mighty wind</i>
<i>That's blowing everywhere</i>

01:19:49.964 --> 01:19:54.697
<i>Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>It's kicking up the sand</i>

01:19:54.868 --> 01:20:00.363
<i>It's blowing out a message</i>
<i>To every woman, child and man</i>

01:20:00.541 --> 01:20:05.478
<i>Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>Cross the land and cross the sea</i>

01:20:05.646 --> 01:20:09.548
<i>It's blowing peace and freedom</i>
<i>It's blowing equality</i>

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:15.211
<i>Yes, it's blowing peace and freedom</i>
<i>It's blowing you and me</i>

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.606
So the morning after the big show
at Town Hall...

01:20:35.776 --> 01:20:38.802
...the TV network executives
were crawling out of the woodwork...

01:20:38.979 --> 01:20:43.075
...trying to get The New Main Street Singers
into a TV series.

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:46.845
We took some very nice meetings.
I ran over my ideas.

01:20:47.021 --> 01:20:51.481
They Loved my idea
where the kids played babies.

01:20:51.659 --> 01:20:54.856
You know, in diapers. And...

01:20:55.029 --> 01:20:59.295
...it always makes me laugh
to see babies talk Like adults.

01:21:00.267 --> 01:21:04.135
The network execs said, "Look, we're not
sitting in judgment of your ideas.

01:21:04.305 --> 01:21:06.865
We Love the kids,
we wanna put them on a series."

01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:10.533
And the word "judgment,"
a Light went on over my head!

01:21:10.711 --> 01:21:13.236
I always thought there were
12 Supreme Court judges...

01:21:13.414 --> 01:21:17.976
...but now it seems there are only nine.
I don't know if it's a budget thing or not.

01:21:18.152 --> 01:21:21.747
But there's also nine
New Main Street Singers.

01:21:21.922 --> 01:21:26.382
And I thought, "What if they were
the Supreme Court judges?"

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.793
And it was my idea to call them "The
Supreme Folk." Tying in the folk singing.

01:21:31.965 --> 01:21:34.365
And here's the idea. During the day...

01:21:34.702 --> 01:21:39.332
...they're handling some of the top,
most difficult cases in the land.

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:44.204
There's a Lot of tension there. And at night,
and this is what sold the networks...

01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:49.605
...they Live in one big house and they
take off their robes and sing folk songs.

01:21:49.783 --> 01:21:53.719
Now, maybe during the day they hear
death penalty cases, and at night...

01:21:53.887 --> 01:21:57.379
...they argue about who cooks dinner
or who does...

01:21:57.558 --> 01:22:01.324
...the laundry or, "Say, why don't
the Ladies bring the coffee?"

01:22:01.495 --> 01:22:03.520
"And that's sexual harassment!

01:22:03.697 --> 01:22:08.361
That was decided in case 126,
Johnson vs...."

01:22:08.535 --> 01:22:12.027
Oh, I Like that.
The women, sexual discrimination.

01:22:12.206 --> 01:22:15.266
I'm not doing much writing,
but the ideas keep popping.

01:22:20.547 --> 01:22:23.641
<i>Won't make your patients cringe</i>

01:22:24.752 --> 01:22:29.246
<i>Sure-Flo, Sure-Flo</i>

01:22:29.923 --> 01:22:32.892
<i>Don't leave them cold and damp</i>

01:22:33.293 --> 01:22:37.024
<i>Use our buttocks drapes and penis clamp</i>

01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:42.066
<i>I'm a musician again.</i>

01:22:42.236 --> 01:22:47.196
<i>Being on-stage again with Mitch</i>
<i>was a great thing.</i>

01:22:48.275 --> 01:22:50.766
Oh, boy. I never thought it was possible.

01:22:50.944 --> 01:22:52.912
And there we were.

01:22:54.448 --> 01:22:57.781
Just wish he didn't
take things so seriously.

01:22:58.152 --> 01:23:00.677
You know. That damn kiss.

01:23:00.921 --> 01:23:05.221
My sister-- Well, they were all at the show,
but my sister Jocelyn said:

01:23:05.392 --> 01:23:10.557
"You led him on. You shouldn't have kissed
him if you didn't wanna go all the way."

01:23:11.098 --> 01:23:15.660
It was just a kiss. And it's part of--
The audience was there waiting for it.

01:23:15.836 --> 01:23:17.804
And I forgot what that feels Like...

01:23:17.971 --> 01:23:21.463
...where you get caught up
in the heat of the moment...

01:23:21.642 --> 01:23:24.941
...and you want to give them...

01:23:25.112 --> 01:23:27.342
...anything they want.

01:23:28.148 --> 01:23:30.378
I think Mitch....

01:23:30.584 --> 01:23:33.178
I didn't lead him on. But he...

01:23:33.353 --> 01:23:36.049
...took it the wrong way, I think.

01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:40.719
I've never been in better head space.

01:23:41.862 --> 01:23:45.127
I'm writing poetry again.

01:23:45.299 --> 01:23:51.238
I'm going through a very prolific phase.

01:23:52.039 --> 01:23:58.171
Ideas are coming faster
than I can write them.

01:23:58.345 --> 01:24:02.805
My one fear in getting together
with Mickey was...

01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:07.413
...always that it might rekindle...

01:24:09.756 --> 01:24:13.624
...feelings that she used to have for me.

01:24:13.794 --> 01:24:18.231
I feel badly that she was misled...

01:24:18.398 --> 01:24:23.199
...by the theatrics of the moment.

01:24:24.004 --> 01:24:30.239
But I think it was a wonderful time
that we both had together.

01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:35.712
I know that I will always think
of her fondly...

01:24:35.883 --> 01:24:39.649
...every time I see a rose.

01:24:43.156 --> 01:24:46.057
<i>We've got some gigs here working</i>
<i>at the casinos.</i>

01:24:46.226 --> 01:24:51.493
It has been a time of changes,
but change is good. Change is Life.

01:24:52.866 --> 01:24:57.769
It was Like a great big door
opening for me, Town Hall.

01:24:57.938 --> 01:25:00.964
After that concert I realized...

01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:04.372
...I wanna spend as much
of the rest of my Life as possible...

01:25:04.545 --> 01:25:08.037
-...playing folk music with these gentlemen.
-Right back at you.

01:25:08.215 --> 01:25:10.410
And I wanna spend all of it as a woman.

01:25:11.018 --> 01:25:15.387
I came to a realization that I was, and am...

01:25:15.556 --> 01:25:18.923
...a blond, female folk singer...

01:25:19.092 --> 01:25:21.959
...trapped in the body of a bald,
male folk singer...

01:25:22.129 --> 01:25:27.795
...and I had to Let me out or I would die.

01:25:28.335 --> 01:25:30.997
When you put it that way,
it's almost poetry.

01:25:31.171 --> 01:25:32.297
Almost.

01:25:32.472 --> 01:25:36.704
<i>Now they don't allow no frowns inside</i>
<i>Leave them by the door</i>

01:25:36.877 --> 01:25:41.177
<i>-There's apple brandy by the keg</i>
<i>-And sawdust on the floor</i>

01:25:41.348 --> 01:25:45.876
<i>So if you've got a hankering</i>
<i>I'll tell you where to go</i>

01:25:46.053 --> 01:25:49.250
<i>Just look for the busted neon sign</i>
<i>That flashes</i>

01:25:49.423 --> 01:25:53.223
<i>Ea-a-oe's</i</i>

01:25:54.305 --> 01:26:00.527
