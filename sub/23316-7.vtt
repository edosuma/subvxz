00:46.040 --> 00:46.960
[ARABIC]

00:47.120 --> 00:49.480
[You kidnapped
the wrong guy.]

00:49.640 --> 00:52.120
[I didn't kidnap anyone.]

00:52.560 --> 00:57.600
[Look, the guy you caught
has friends in high places,]

00:57.760 --> 01:00.080
[who will be on your case
until he's released.]

01:00.600 --> 01:04.140
[You should be worried because
he means a great deal to us.]

01:04.300 --> 01:06.160
[He's like our brother.]

01:06.320 --> 01:08.880
[And we won't stop killing.
Listen carefully,]

01:09.040 --> 01:10.800
[we won't stop killing]

01:10.960 --> 01:14.160
[until he returns home, showers
and eats his mom's cooking!]

01:14.320 --> 01:16.280
[So I'll ask you again,]

01:16.440 --> 01:18.440
[where is Abu Ahmad?]

01:19.120 --> 01:21.640
[In heaven, with the rest
of the Shahids.]

01:22.880 --> 01:25.000
[When did you last see him?]

01:25.520 --> 01:30.000
[A year and a half ago.
Four days before he was killed.]

01:30.160 --> 01:32.640
[I shot him on his brother's
wedding day.]

01:33.720 --> 01:36.520
[If you don't tell me where
Abu Ahmad is, I will kill you.]

01:36.680 --> 01:40.640
[I was born to die a Shahid, my son,
whenever that may happen.]

01:40.960 --> 01:44.280
[You'll wish you had died a Shahid
by the time I kill you.]

02:02.680 --> 02:05.240
[So I'm asking you
one more time...]

02:06.120 --> 02:07.840
[I don't know
where Abu Ahmad is.]

02:08.000 --> 02:11.040
[I swear I don't.]

02:12.880 --> 02:16.800
[May God have mercy on me,
I don't know where Abu Ahmad is.]

02:16.960 --> 02:19.800
[I just want to do a prisoner swap
between you and our friend.]

02:19.960 --> 02:21.160
[For both your sakes.]

02:21.320 --> 02:23.960
[I told you, I don't know
where Abu Ahmad is!]

02:44.840 --> 02:46.600
[I'm listening.]

02:48.000 --> 02:51.160
[8 Yahya Ayyash street, Ramallah.]

02:51.320 --> 02:55.640
[It's near the Prime Minister's bureau,
beneath ground level.]

03:40.800 --> 03:43.400
[I'll make sure they pay
for what they've done.]

03:43.600 --> 03:46.560
[I bet those animals are
interrogating him with torture.]

03:46.720 --> 03:48.560
[I think he'll buckle.]

03:48.720 --> 03:51.160
[We can't risk it.
We must get out of here.]

03:51.320 --> 03:52.840
[Don't worry,
he won't say a word.]

03:53.000 --> 03:55.900
[-He's only human. You never know.]
[-Walid!]

03:56.060 --> 03:59.120
[You know how it is in captivity.
In the end, everyone talks.]

03:59.280 --> 04:01.880
[Everyone but the Sheikh.
He won't say a word.]

04:02.040 --> 04:05.040
[He was here in this house,
you never know.]

04:05.280 --> 04:07.520
[We can't risk it.
We must get out of here.]

04:07.680 --> 04:08.880
[Nassrin and the kids must hide.]

04:09.040 --> 04:11.280
[The Jews
won't come near them.]

04:11.440 --> 04:13.200
[The Jews kidnapped
Sheikh Awdallah,]

04:13.360 --> 04:15.320
[you never know what
else could happen.]

04:17.040 --> 04:20.280
[-Nassrin would never agree anyway.]
[-But there's no other choice.]

04:20.640 --> 04:22.880
[Yes, there is.]

04:23.240 --> 04:27.240
[I beg of you, Abu Ahmad,
let's get out of here.]

04:27.640 --> 04:29.600
[I'm begging you.]

04:30.960 --> 04:32.640
[Alright.]

04:33.480 --> 04:35.200
[One more thing.]

04:35.840 --> 04:37.680
[Abu Samara wants
to talk to you.]

04:37.840 --> 04:41.000
[-What does the son of a bitch want?]
[-It's something about the soldier.]

04:41.160 --> 04:43.520
[Tell that piece of shit
to go fuck himself.]

04:43.600 --> 04:45.600
[But we have to talk to him,
we have no other choice.]

04:45.680 --> 04:47.920
[Again you say
we have no choice?]

04:49.040 --> 04:50.760
[I won't talk to him.]

05:17.480 --> 05:19.360
[Give me your hand.]

05:42.800 --> 05:44.080
What?

05:49.680 --> 05:51.760
I don't know
how you guys do it.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.920
How?

06:05.040 --> 06:08.280
Did you ever see a fight dog
get an order to attack?

06:12.280 --> 06:13.920
Did you, Nurit?

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
Yeah, in movies.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.600
What does it look like
in the movies?

06:25.240 --> 06:27.840
He gets the command
and immediately attacks.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.440
Exactly.
He does it immediately.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.640
Nothing else matters to him.
He pounces with the aim to kill.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.080
He doesn't care if his head
gets chopped off doing it.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.800
We, Nurit...

06:47.600 --> 06:49.640
...are just like those attack dogs.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.440
That's how we were trained.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.680
Fight dogs get beaten up
and starved.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.720
We'd get beaten up each evening
to build our resilience.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.040
When we hear the word "action"
over the radio,

07:07.200 --> 07:08.880
we pounce.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.520
Don't you think
about your wife?

07:16.520 --> 07:20.160
-Don't you think of your son Guy?
-There is no Guy at those moments.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.920
There's nothing.

07:28.120 --> 07:32.720
We were trained not to think.
You know why?

07:35.560 --> 07:39.000
Because if I stop to think
about him for just a split second,

07:39.960 --> 07:42.440
I'll become petrified with fear.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.240
I won't be able to move.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.960
I don't want that
to happen to me.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.720
It's like being dead.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.760
Then you don't belong here.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.080
You're putting us at risk.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.440
Fuck!

08:38.600 --> 08:40.760
Son of a bitch!

08:42.800 --> 08:46.640
Steve, when we go back, you and
Nurit are going to guard his house.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.200
If you see his wife, kids,
anything that moves, you tell me.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.440
-Got it?
-Yes.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.080
[-Isn't he coming?]
[-He really wants to, but...]

09:37.240 --> 09:38.560
[I want the Jew.]

09:38.720 --> 09:41.160
[-Abu Ahmad wanted--]
[-Stop talking.]

09:41.320 --> 09:44.840
[Listen to me
and pass it down to him.]

09:45.080 --> 09:47.240
[It's the soldier
who killed his brother.]

09:50.200 --> 09:52.240
[I don't know who he killed,]

09:52.400 --> 09:55.120
[but we can't let people
do as they please.]

09:55.280 --> 09:58.440
[Thousands of women are waiting
for their husbands and sons.]

09:58.920 --> 10:01.040
[We want the soldier
so we can release those prisoners.]

10:01.200 --> 10:04.640
[Abu Ahmad loves the Sheikh and
wants him freed as soon as possible.]

10:04.800 --> 10:07.360
[That's why he wants to provoke
a clashing within 24 hours.]

10:07.520 --> 10:11.760
[-Abu Ahmad has a plan.]
[-He has a plan? Who the hell is he?]

10:12.000 --> 10:15.240
[Only the leadership
makes the plans.]

10:15.800 --> 10:19.440
[We've all mourned relatives, but that
doesn't mean he can do as he pleases.]

10:19.600 --> 10:22.520
[Abu Ahmad doesn't
call the shots!]

10:22.680 --> 10:24.720
[Only the leadership!]

10:27.000 --> 10:29.600
[You've got 24 hours
to bring him in.]

10:29.760 --> 10:31.560
[24 hours,]

10:31.720 --> 10:33.760
[not a minute more.]

10:34.800 --> 10:36.400
[Look at me.]

10:38.320 --> 10:42.200
[Tell Abu Ahmad
to bring the soldier here,]

10:42.360 --> 10:48.480
[or I will see to it that he never
disrupts the movement again.]

10:48.640 --> 10:49.920
[Ever.]

10:50.840 --> 10:52.640
[Understood?]

10:53.920 --> 10:55.720
[Understood?]

10:56.640 --> 10:58.440
[Understood.]

11:10.280 --> 11:12.120
[-Put it here.]
[-No, here.]

11:12.280 --> 11:14.040
[-Where?]
[-Here.]

11:19.040 --> 11:20.640
[Excuse me, Abu Ahmad.]

11:24.560 --> 11:26.160
[Hello?]

11:26.440 --> 11:28.480
[I'm coming to see him.]

11:29.600 --> 11:32.240
[-We're not there anymore.]
[-As if I knew where you were.]

11:32.400 --> 11:35.120
[-Send someone to get me.]
[-Why do you want to see him?]

11:35.280 --> 11:39.320
[He's post-op. I must
check on him every three hours.]

11:40.360 --> 11:42.960
[I want to make sure
there are no infections]

11:43.120 --> 11:45.160
[and to run tests.]

11:46.480 --> 11:49.880
[Are you giving him
the antibiotics I left for you?]

11:50.040 --> 11:53.640
[Shirin, I have no time to play nurse.
He's fine.]

11:53.800 --> 11:57.120
[-He might have a slight fever.]
[-A fever is a sign of infection,]

11:57.280 --> 12:01.520
[which could lead
to low blood pressure,]

12:03.400 --> 12:05.520
[and he could die.]

12:05.680 --> 12:08.640
[So unless you want him dying
on your watch, let me see him.]

12:08.840 --> 12:11.560
[-I don't know...]
[-Do it for me.]

12:12.720 --> 12:14.560
[For me.]

12:15.360 --> 12:17.520
[I'm losing sleep over it.]

12:18.720 --> 12:24.720
[Please, just let me see him
to make sure he's alright.]

12:26.760 --> 12:30.000
[Just ten minutes.
Ten minutes.]

12:30.160 --> 12:33.480
[-Walid!]
[-Okay, I'll see what I can do.]

12:38.400 --> 12:39.800
[Walid.]

12:49.000 --> 12:50.440
[Call the Sheikh.]

12:50.800 --> 12:52.200
[How will I talk to him?]

12:52.360 --> 12:54.720
[Call his cell phone, we'll speak
with the Jews who caught him.]

12:54.880 --> 12:57.320
[We'll negotiate with them,
no Egyptians or Germans needed,]

12:57.480 --> 13:00.280
[quickly, with no mediators.]

13:03.320 --> 13:05.920
[-Call him up, what can we lose?]
[-Alright.]

13:07.360 --> 13:09.240
[Here's a voice changer.]

13:11.080 --> 13:13.280
[Use it like I told you, okay?]

13:18.240 --> 13:20.720
[I think you should let Shirin
check him.]

13:21.400 --> 13:22.180
[Why?]

13:22.340 --> 13:25.720
[You saw him, he's all swollen
and boiling with fever.]

13:25.880 --> 13:29.040
[We can't lose him. We might need
more time than we planned.]

13:29.200 --> 13:31.440
[-No, we don't.]
[-We do.]

13:32.120 --> 13:34.240
[Listen to me for once.]

13:36.280 --> 13:38.800
[Alright.
Have her check him up.]

13:40.560 --> 13:44.200
[For God's sake, is that
what's on your mind now?]

13:44.600 --> 13:46.200
[Call.]

13:55.480 --> 13:58.680
Doron,
it's the Sheikh's cell phone.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.120
[Hello?]

14:04.280 --> 14:06.200
[Hello, who's this?]

14:06.520 --> 14:10.160
[Sheikh Awdallah's disciple. With whom
do I have the pleasure of speaking?]

14:12.440 --> 14:14.040
[I'm also the Sheikh's disciple,]

14:14.200 --> 14:17.160
[and I want him back along
with another 1,500 prisoners.]

14:17.360 --> 14:21.200
[-I'll speak only with Abu Ahmad.]
[-Abu Ahmad has died a Shahid.]

14:21.360 --> 14:23.720
[The Sheikh already told me
that Abu Ahmad is alive,]

14:23.880 --> 14:25.720
[and if you don't let me
talk to him,]

14:25.880 --> 14:28.840
[your Sheikh will be the first
to fuck 72 virgins.]

14:29.000 --> 14:32.040
[Since when does the
State of Israel kill prisoners?]

14:33.560 --> 14:35.640
[I'm not the State of Israel.]

14:37.200 --> 14:38.520
[Who are you then?]

14:38.680 --> 14:42.840
[I'm the one who will kill the Sheikh
if you don't return our guy.]

14:44.560 --> 14:47.080
[How can we be sure
you've got the Sheikh?]

14:47.240 --> 14:49.240
[Talk to him, he's listening.]

14:50.000 --> 14:52.680
[Don't give in to them!
Don't surrender!]

14:54.680 --> 14:56.840
[Now, put my friend
on the phone.]

14:58.120 --> 14:59.760
[Your friend isn't here.]

14:59.920 --> 15:05.600
[Okay, we're done playing games.
I want a prisoner swap within 24 hours.]

15:06.360 --> 15:10.240
[We're okay with the swap
and with the timeframe,]

15:10.400 --> 15:13.120
[but we've got a list
of other prisoners as well.]

15:13.280 --> 15:16.480
[You're not listening to me. I have
no other prisoners but the Sheikh.]

15:16.640 --> 15:18.400
[If you want him in exchange
for our guy, that's great.]

15:18.560 --> 15:20.440
[If not, then we're done talking.]

15:23.000 --> 15:26.600
[We'll send a prisoner list
to your drop box.]

15:26.760 --> 15:30.000
[You're not listening,
I have no prisoners!]

15:30.160 --> 15:32.440
[No prisoners, no swap.]

15:34.080 --> 15:37.360
[And since you say
you're nobody,]

15:37.520 --> 15:39.480
[we want a government
minister of yours]

15:39.640 --> 15:41.560
[present when you
return our prisoners.]

15:47.840 --> 15:50.000
[I don't know
what's going on here.]

15:50.480 --> 15:53.800
[It's nothing. It must be
Gideon Avital, the smartass,]

15:53.960 --> 15:57.040
[with his usual lies and antics.
He thinks he won't pay a heavy toll,]

15:57.200 --> 15:59.840
[but I'll make the fucker
pay through the nose.]

16:06.280 --> 16:09.240
-It's all on the computer, it's better.
-I like it this way.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.320
-Can I help?
-Do you know where Doron is?

16:12.720 --> 16:14.600
I already told you, I don't.

16:15.680 --> 16:20.640
-Think, where would he take the Sheikh?
-Beats me.

16:20.800 --> 16:24.680
How could your entire team pull
a stunt like this without you knowing?

16:24.920 --> 16:27.120
Are you accusing me
of something?

16:27.280 --> 16:31.480
Why did Doron ask everyone
but you to join him?

16:31.640 --> 16:33.960
Because he knew
I'd never agree to it, okay?

16:34.120 --> 16:35.640
This is mutiny,

16:35.800 --> 16:38.920
and if I ever find out you knew
about this, I will fuck you over.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.720
Big time.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.960
[No, no...!]

17:17.120 --> 17:20.440
[Relax, relax.]

17:21.680 --> 17:24.120
[When did you last
give him the antibiotics?]

17:24.600 --> 17:27.160
[About four hours ago, or something.]

17:27.320 --> 17:31.080
[What is this? The bottle should be
half full and it's empty.]

17:41.680 --> 17:43.920
[You'll feel better soon.]

17:45.520 --> 17:47.120
[You'll feel better soon.]

17:57.880 --> 18:01.280
[-Please...]
[-Shhhh...]

18:40.120 --> 18:43.320
[Don't be scared,
everything's alright.]

18:44.280 --> 18:46.000
[Thank you.]

18:47.360 --> 18:49.240
[I'm sorry.]

18:51.800 --> 18:53.800
[Stay here.]

18:53.960 --> 18:55.800
[I'm sorry.]

19:04.840 --> 19:07.200
[Don't go, don't go.]

19:07.560 --> 19:09.240
[Don't go.]

19:11.360 --> 19:12.800
[Shirin.]

19:16.280 --> 19:19.600
[-Shirin.]
[-What?]

19:19.760 --> 19:21.440
[How much longer
does he have?]

19:21.600 --> 19:25.280
[Given that he's here in his current state
and not in a hospital, ten hours,]

19:25.440 --> 19:28.600
[maybe less. We must
return him to them.]

19:28.920 --> 19:31.920
[Alright, I'll see him when
I get back from Abu Ahmad.]

19:52.760 --> 19:54.320
Something's up.

19:58.720 --> 20:01.600
All I see is an old lady
watering her plants.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.320
It's okay.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.600
What's your real name?

20:13.040 --> 20:16.000
-Steve.
-Tell me the truth.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.920
Herzl.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.280
Herzl?

20:28.240 --> 20:30.600
Yes, Herzl.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.280
Nurit, I hope we're
not wasting our time

20:40.440 --> 20:43.680
while God knows
what they're doing to Boaz.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.160
I hope they're treating him
like we're treating the Sheikh.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.120
Nurit, what's with you?

20:50.760 --> 20:54.240
It was the only way
to get that fucker to talk.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.760
Trust Doron,
he's got no regrets...

21:01.400 --> 21:03.280
Whoa, are you okay?

21:06.880 --> 21:08.880
Is this because of Boaz?

21:11.360 --> 21:13.880
Don't worry, Nurit,
we'll get him back.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.400
By hook or by crook.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.160
Everything alright?

21:44.360 --> 21:45.960
There there...

21:51.760 --> 21:53.320
Sorry.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.560
-Anything new?
-Nothing.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.680
They're not carrying phones,
and we haven't tracked

22:04.840 --> 22:07.120
any incoming calls
to relatives in Ramallah or Nablus.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.160
-E-mails?
-Nothing was sent in the last 24 hours.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.440
They're smarter than that.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.440
Gideon says Doron
is under a ton of pressure,

22:13.600 --> 22:15.920
it's the perfect time
to screw up.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.280
Who's that?

22:23.520 --> 22:25.240
Okay, let her in.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.800
Gali, we're doing everything we can
to bring him back ASAP.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.400
We've joined with the IDF,
the Secret Service, the Mossad,

22:47.560 --> 22:51.080
and Gideon Avital is in contact
with foreign Intelligence bodies.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.320
We'll get him back.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.200
If Boaz dies,
it'll be on your conscience.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.840
Gali, come here.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.520
You'll get him back.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.760
Come, Gali.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.600
Not now, bro.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.800
Everything will be okay.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.440
-Want some water?
-Yes.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.800
Tell me the truth.

24:12.520 --> 24:16.400
As far as we know, Doron took
part of the team to go find Boaz

24:16.560 --> 24:20.520
with no authorization nor backup.
Just picked up and left.

24:21.080 --> 24:25.960
-Have you heard from him?
-Nothing. He ended contact.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.280
Why didn't you join them?

24:35.800 --> 24:39.800
It all happened so fast, at the time
I didn't think it was a good idea.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.800
You know I'll do anything
to bring Boaz back.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.480
How much
can you do from here?

24:48.640 --> 24:50.880
Do you really think
what he did was normal?

24:51.640 --> 24:53.960
I told him to do it.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.720
[Walid.]

25:18.000 --> 25:19.640
[How's the prisoner list
coming along?]

25:19.800 --> 25:22.920
[It isn't. I told you,
I've got no prisoners.]

25:24.400 --> 25:28.360
[Okay. Perhaps talking with
your friend will change your mind.]

25:32.240 --> 25:33.240
[Talk.]

25:33.400 --> 25:35.920
-Doron.
-Boaz.

25:37.640 --> 25:41.080
Don't worry,
we're coming to rescue you.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.360
They opened me up, Doron,
they took my kidney.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.440
What?!

25:46.560 --> 25:48.640
-Doron...
-Boaz!

25:50.000 --> 25:51.520
Get me out of here.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.720
-Get me out of here, Doron!
-Boaz!

25:55.480 --> 25:57.200
Boaz!

25:58.160 --> 25:59.760
[Walid!]

26:00.320 --> 26:02.080
[Walid!]

26:03.240 --> 26:05.080
[What did you do to him?!]

26:05.280 --> 26:07.880
[Nothing yet.
This was nothing.]

26:08.320 --> 26:09.840
[What about the list?]

26:10.520 --> 26:11.420
[Listen to me.]

26:11.580 --> 26:14.040
[I'll rip the Sheikh's eyes
and heart out with my bare hands]

26:14.200 --> 26:17.120
[if you don't return my friend
alive and well.]

26:17.800 --> 26:19.400
[One more thing:]

26:19.560 --> 26:22.800
[Gone are the days when we freed
1,000 prisoners in exchange for one.]

26:22.960 --> 26:26.720
[Forget it! It's the Sheikh
in exchange for your prisoner!]

26:28.920 --> 26:30.880
[Listen, you son of a bitch.]

26:31.040 --> 26:33.400
[There's no way I'd agree
to such a swap.]

26:33.560 --> 26:37.160
[I'd rather have the Sheikh
die as a Shahid, understood?]

26:43.400 --> 26:45.560
[I'll send you a list of 50 prisoners]

26:45.720 --> 26:48.240
[and I want Gideon Avital
present during the swap]

26:48.400 --> 26:50.840
[so that things are taken seriously,
understood?]

26:52.000 --> 26:57.280
[He'll be there. But listen to me,
Walid Al-Abed, you bastard,]

26:57.440 --> 26:59.680
[if anything happens to my friend,]

26:59.840 --> 27:02.560
[I will personally
come and kill you.]

27:02.720 --> 27:06.440
[I will slaughter your entire family
and drink your blood!]

27:16.920 --> 27:23.840
MASYOUN NEIGHBORHOOD
RAMALLAH

27:42.560 --> 27:44.720
[-What are you doing here?]
[-Hello.]

27:44.880 --> 27:47.520
[-How did you get here?]
[-Can I come in?]

27:47.680 --> 27:49.120
[Please do.]

27:53.800 --> 27:56.000
[I need to tell you something.]

27:59.160 --> 28:01.360
[I'm from
the Palestine Preventive Security.]

28:04.560 --> 28:06.400
[I couldn't tell you that before.]

28:06.560 --> 28:09.080
[I shouldn't have told
you that now either,]

28:09.240 --> 28:11.080
[but I wanted to level with you.]

28:12.000 --> 28:15.440
[To level with me?
After lying this whole time?]

28:15.600 --> 28:19.480
[Look, a Fauda (riot) is about to
break out, and I want to protect you.]

28:19.640 --> 28:21.840
[But you'll have to tell me
what you've done.]

28:22.000 --> 28:24.880
[What did I do?
What do you want from me?]

28:25.040 --> 28:29.200
[We know that the people who kidnapped
the Jew took out his kidney.]

28:30.200 --> 28:33.120
[I want to know if you had
anything to do with it.]

28:33.280 --> 28:36.240
[I don't know
what you're talking about.]

28:36.400 --> 28:39.000
[If the Jew dies,
we're all doomed.]

28:39.160 --> 28:40.680
[The Jews will attack us.]

28:40.840 --> 28:42.840
[Nothing will stop them.]

28:43.000 --> 28:45.200
[Many women and children
will die,]

28:45.360 --> 28:49.440
[so unless you want them ending up
in your E.R., tell me the truth.]

28:49.600 --> 28:51.520
[It's not what you think.]

28:53.960 --> 28:57.440
[They asked me to operate on him,
but I didn't take out his kidney.]

28:57.800 --> 29:01.080
[They gave me something
to put inside his abdomen.]

29:02.120 --> 29:05.080
[You don't understand,
they were holding my mother ransom]

29:05.240 --> 29:07.760
[and threatened to kill her
if I don't do the implant.]

29:07.920 --> 29:11.680
[-What did you implant?]
[-Something this big,]

29:12.360 --> 29:14.800
[could be electronic,]

29:14.960 --> 29:16.880
[perhaps a computer.]

29:56.480 --> 29:58.040
What happened, bro?

29:59.240 --> 30:00.680
What is it?

30:00.840 --> 30:02.880
They put something
inside Boaz's abdomen.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.680
-What?!
-Who told you that?

30:04.840 --> 30:08.080
The doctor who did it.
She doesn't know what it is.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.160
-Perhaps a tracking device?
-Why would they do that?

30:12.440 --> 30:14.240
Give me a cigarette.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.080
It could be a...

30:23.000 --> 30:25.840
This is gonna sound crazy,
but hear me out.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.240
In 2009, Al-Qaeda
tried to assassinate

30:29.400 --> 30:31.680
the Saudi prince Mohammed Bin Naif

30:33.000 --> 30:37.080
using a suicide bomber with
an explosive charge in his abdomen.

30:39.040 --> 30:43.120
But that was Al-Qaeda. Could
Abu Ahmad do something like that?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.960
That's exactly it.
He wants to carry out

30:46.120 --> 30:47.720
a terrorist attack during the swap.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.720
-They also want Gideon Avital there.
-He wants Gideon Avital wiped out.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.600
Not that I care about the fucker,

30:52.760 --> 30:55.040
but they're planning an attack,
ISIS style.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.600
I'll slaughter that motherfucker.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.840
We're executing Plan B.

31:04.200 --> 31:08.040
Steve, Nurit, go.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.920
For fuck's sake!

31:19.680 --> 31:20.880
[It's not his fault.]

31:21.040 --> 31:23.280
[The Israelis are after him,
what could he do?]

31:23.440 --> 31:26.920
[Enough. I've sacrificed enough,
let someone else do it.]

31:27.120 --> 31:29.840
[You don't need to tell me
about sacrifice.]

31:30.000 --> 31:34.160
[I'm sorry. But I don't want us
to lose Abu Ahmad as well.]

31:34.320 --> 31:37.200
[The kids are growing up
thinking their father is dead.]

31:37.360 --> 31:40.240
[I hate it. I want them
to have a proper father]

31:40.400 --> 31:42.640
[whom they can respect
and be with.]

31:42.800 --> 31:45.800
[Enough. Wake the kids up,
it's late.]

31:46.840 --> 31:49.080
[Are we moving again?]

31:50.360 --> 31:52.440
[Just for a few days, sweetie.]

31:52.600 --> 31:56.080
[-Where's Abura?]
[-She's probably at Zrizi's.]

31:56.840 --> 31:58.360
[Abir.]

32:15.440 --> 32:16.880
[Abir.]

32:18.360 --> 32:19.920
[Abir.]

32:20.560 --> 32:22.000
[Abir!]

32:22.760 --> 32:27.120
<i>[The successful attack</i>
<i>was a real blow to the enemy,]</i>

32:27.280 --> 32:31.320
<i>[and was just one of the many</i>
<i>surprises planned...]</i>

32:39.000 --> 32:41.120
[I thought you forgot about us.]

32:41.280 --> 32:45.440
[We're willing to swap the Sheikh
plus 50 prisoners, for Boaz.]

32:45.600 --> 32:48.120
[If this doesn't happen
in the next two hours,]

32:48.280 --> 32:49.860
[I'm setting the Sheikh on fire.]

32:50.020 --> 32:52.680
[The swap will take place
in Wadi Zaitoon.]

32:53.680 --> 32:55.520
[Alright, I know where that is.]

32:55.720 --> 32:59.720
[I want this to go down
nice and quiet. No Fauda.]

33:03.480 --> 33:06.640
[Heaven help you
if you put up any snipers.]

33:06.800 --> 33:09.120
[I want the area clear
for a radius of 1 km.]

33:09.280 --> 33:10.220
[No problem.]

33:10.380 --> 33:12.640
[Which government official
are you sending?]

33:12.800 --> 33:16.280
[The most important one -
our Defense Minister.]

33:16.440 --> 33:18.800
[Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.]

33:18.960 --> 33:21.720
[I know you put a bomb
inside your prisoner.]

33:21.960 --> 33:25.000
[If you detonate it,
we blow up the Sheikh.]

33:29.040 --> 33:30.840
[Who knows about the bomb?]

33:31.000 --> 33:32.120
[-Two people.]
[-Who?]

33:32.280 --> 33:34.520
[-Bassam and Shirin.]
[-And you. That's three.]

33:34.680 --> 33:37.440
[-Me?!]
[-Then how did it leak out?]

33:37.600 --> 33:40.160
[-You think I told them?!]
[-I don't know what to think.]

33:40.320 --> 33:42.280
[One of your people
works for the Jews.]

33:42.440 --> 33:44.720
[-Can't be!]
[-Well, it is!]

33:44.920 --> 33:46.880
[-Perhaps it was your cousin Shirin.]
[-Or you.]

33:47.040 --> 33:50.000
[Walid! Shut up,
or I swear to God...]

33:50.160 --> 33:53.320
[I'm sick of this! We should've
given him to Abu Samara!]

33:57.320 --> 33:59.600
[He should've taken care of it.]

34:06.040 --> 34:12.360
WADI ZAITOON
WEST OF RAMALLAH

34:36.680 --> 34:38.160
[Looks clear.]

34:38.320 --> 34:40.520
[No soldiers or cars.]

34:50.560 --> 34:51.920
[Hold on.]

34:55.600 --> 34:57.400
[There's a car approaching.]

35:16.560 --> 35:18.240
[Do you see the Sheikh?]

35:19.720 --> 35:21.520
[Walid, what's going on?]

35:42.880 --> 35:46.000
[The Sheikh is facing us.
Our prisoner is out of the car.]

35:47.760 --> 35:49.600
[Is Gideon Avital there?]

36:01.680 --> 36:03.160
[Walid?]

36:03.320 --> 36:04.960
[Talk to me!]

36:11.440 --> 36:12.720
[Walid.]

36:12.880 --> 36:14.160
[Abir is here.]

36:14.320 --> 36:15.800
[Abir is here.]

36:16.200 --> 36:18.800
[Two armed men have Abir and
the Sheikh wearing explosive belts.]

36:18.960 --> 36:21.600
[-What?!]
[-Abu Ahmad, what do we do?]

36:28.800 --> 36:33.200
[If you detonate Boaz,
I blow Abir up.]

36:40.760 --> 36:45.880
[I repeat: If you detonate Boaz,
I blow Abir up!]

36:46.680 --> 36:48.200
[What do we do?]

36:51.920 --> 36:55.360
Boaz, don't worry,
we're coming to get you.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.280
[Abu Ahmad,
what do we do?]

37:00.520 --> 37:03.480
[-How far are you from Abir?]
[-Pretty close, I guess.]

37:03.640 --> 37:05.920
[-How far?]
[-I don't know exactly, Abu Ahmad.]

37:06.080 --> 37:08.080
[50 meters away?
20? 100? 1,000?]

37:08.240 --> 37:11.120
[Less, around 30 meters.]

37:12.600 --> 37:15.800
<i>[Think not of those who are slain</i>
<i>in Allah's way as dead.]</i>

37:15.960 --> 37:18.760

37:21.280 --> 37:22.640
[Let him go.]

37:30.280 --> 37:32.280
Come here, Boaz.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.480
Walk towards me.

37:41.040 --> 37:44.240
A bit more, keep walking.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.240
[Tell me what to do.]

37:51.400 --> 37:54.240
[Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!]

37:54.400 --> 37:56.120
[-Press it.]
[-What?!]

37:57.520 --> 38:01.280
Walk towards me, Boaz,
don't worry.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.440
[Press it! Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!]

38:04.600 --> 38:06.280
[Press it!]
