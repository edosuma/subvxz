WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.608
Geordie Shore is back.

00:10.009 --> 00:12.445
Last time around,
Ricci and Vicky split up.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.714
We just need to be on our own.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.151
Dan and Ricci are gone.

00:19.719 --> 00:20.720
Fuck off!

00:21.454 --> 00:22.889
Me and Charlotte are done.

00:22.956 --> 00:26.159
I'm sick of arguing.
This time I mean it. I love ya.

00:26.226 --> 00:30.597
Me and Gary still aren't speaking,
I want nothing to do with him.

00:30.663 --> 00:32.131
Bye, James.
See you later.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.735
I regret what happened between me
and Holly cos we were friends.

00:35.802 --> 00:39.973
I don't want anything to do him.
He's not the person that I knew.

00:42.709 --> 00:46.813
Newcastle done, Cancun done,

00:46.880 --> 00:50.450
Australia, guess what?
You're getting done.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.386
The Geordies are going Down Under.
To Australia!

00:54.487 --> 00:57.223
I've met someone
who I really care about.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.660
It's still quite new.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.630
(Australian accent)
Throw a shrimp on the barbie.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.599
Hello? Help!

01:06.666 --> 01:10.970
The Geordies are going Down Under...
and deep into the bush.

01:11.037 --> 01:12.872
(screaming)

01:14.808 --> 01:17.076
So Heidi and Audrina have
had a facelift

01:17.143 --> 01:19.813
and they are ready to go on holiday.

01:20.547 --> 01:23.983
You're a stupid little prick,
no-one even likes you.

01:24.050 --> 01:25.452
They don't move!

01:29.088 --> 01:31.891
It's fucking Jay.
I'm off me face meself, man.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.561
This one's gonna be the best yet.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.531
Rouse yourselves, this is a war!

01:43.603 --> 01:45.104
A boom!

01:46.806 --> 01:49.542
(screams)

01:49.609 --> 01:52.412
Here we go again,
a load of cocks going Down Under.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.214
What's changed?
(screams)

01:55.915 --> 01:58.184
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.386
I am Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.655
I never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:02.722 --> 02:04.557
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.559
I talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.294
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.764
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.967
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:15.768 --> 02:19.105
I'm going Australia and like
the typical bell-end what I am,

02:19.172 --> 02:21.274
I forgot me passport.
What a nightmare.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.777
Gaz is gonna be in Sydney
cleaning up

02:24.844 --> 02:28.147
and I'm gonna be stuck having a tug
in the fucking hotel room

02:28.214 --> 02:29.849
waiting for my passport.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.596
Australia! The Geordies have landed.

02:45.164 --> 02:46.966
Wheee!

02:47.033 --> 02:50.203
(Holly) Why's it raining?
I don't like it.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.339
I could have looked out me window
in Newcastle for rain.

02:53.406 --> 02:56.643
I'm gonna look like Diana Ross
cos me hair will get massive.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.978
I'll look like
I've got period on me face.

02:59.045 --> 03:02.248
Charlotte has just decided
to not fucking turn up.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.652
Is it cos she's scared of what
might happen with her and Gary?

03:05.718 --> 03:08.488
Cos she's busy sucking off
the new man in her life?

03:08.555 --> 03:11.157
Who fucking knows?
Can I borrow your umbrella?

03:11.224 --> 03:13.660
No.
Wicked. Friendly as well.

03:13.726 --> 03:14.727
We got out of bed.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.530
If we were shagging people,
we'd still come.

03:17.597 --> 03:20.733
I don't like
the way we flew 24 hours for this.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.237
I'm sure it's meant to be sunny.
If James is coming to Australia

03:24.304 --> 03:27.140
and he is still with Kate
and has the same attitude,

03:27.206 --> 03:29.542
I want nothing to do with him.
You go first.

03:29.609 --> 03:32.211
Come on! She's coming!
I'm coming.

03:32.278 --> 03:36.749
I'm in the puddle, great.
Watch your feet! Your fake tan!

03:36.816 --> 03:38.084
(laughter)

03:38.151 --> 03:40.887
Me and Ricci are no longer together.

03:40.954 --> 03:45.358
I'm not engaged any more
and I'm single.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.094
Back to the old Vicky.

03:48.161 --> 03:52.031
Get it washed off them heels!
(laughter)

03:57.003 --> 03:59.038
What the fuck is that?

03:59.105 --> 04:02.442
Gonna have a lot of mystery.
It's a shagging wagon.

04:02.508 --> 04:05.211
Mystery solved, it's a shit hole.
Let's go, girls!

04:06.713 --> 04:07.947
It's upside down.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.018
OK.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.786
(cheering)

04:18.690 --> 04:21.527
All the way to Australia
and it's fucking raining.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.229
(sighs)

04:23.296 --> 04:26.699
We've had a 24-hour flight
so me and Gaz are knackered.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.968
This is gonna be so good, man.

04:29.035 --> 04:33.373
A 24-hour flight next to that boring
fucker and now it's raining.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.175
Do you know how many fit birds
there are in Sydney?

04:36.242 --> 04:39.245
It's gonna be unbelievable.
I will miss Ricci and Dan.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.982
Dan's like a little brother.
Australian birds are the best.

04:43.049 --> 04:47.520
Ricci, I won't miss the arguments
but I did have a bond with him.

04:50.423 --> 04:53.092
(Sophie) Right, let's go!
(all cheer)

05:06.973 --> 05:08.841
I do want to be with Kate

05:08.908 --> 05:11.477
but that won't stop us
from having fun out here.

05:11.544 --> 05:15.615
I can't fucking wait, like.
There's gonna be so many girls.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.618
All the girls are just
healthy-looking.

05:18.685 --> 05:22.855
They all look after themselves.
I just want to get out tonight.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.490
Unpack, start drinking.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.269
(horn blares)

05:36.335 --> 05:40.273
I cannot wait to see our house.
This could be the best one yet.

05:46.245 --> 05:47.647
Wow.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.115
And it's absolutely sick.

05:52.785 --> 05:55.555
To the new house.
Fuckin' get it on and explore.

06:00.993 --> 06:04.097
Now this is the shag pad.
It's got a garden!

06:04.163 --> 06:06.666
The shag pad is the best shag pad
we've ever had.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.368
It's upstairs
out of the way of everyone,

06:09.435 --> 06:10.837
no-one's coming up here.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.739
Give them the old romantic shit,

06:12.805 --> 06:15.007
"Look at the view,
want a glass of wine?"

06:15.074 --> 06:17.410
When really you're gonna get banged.

06:17.477 --> 06:19.946
The moonlight's up there
and you're be like,

06:20.012 --> 06:21.814
"Enough of that, let's go to bed."

06:21.881 --> 06:25.218
All I know is once I'm finished
with these Australian girls,

06:25.284 --> 06:28.688
Bondi rescue's phone will ring
off the hook. Them sea views.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.292
(beeps horn)
(screams)

06:33.359 --> 06:34.627
(cheers)

06:34.694 --> 06:37.830
We're here?
The boys aren't in that, are they?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.700
(horns blaring)

06:40.767 --> 06:42.969
Then we hear horns going
and we think,

06:43.035 --> 06:44.704
"This has got to be the girls."

06:48.708 --> 06:52.044
And they only pulled up in
a stupid fucking camper van.

06:52.111 --> 06:54.547
(Vicky) Did youse drive in that?
(Gaz) Aye.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.048
We hated it.
(laughter)

06:56.115 --> 06:59.385
Where's Charlotte?
She's not here yet.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.854
(Holly) Arriving fashionably late.
Right.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.257
Apparently
Charlotte's got a boyfriend.

07:04.323 --> 07:07.126
As much as I love her as a friend
and I care about her,

07:07.193 --> 07:08.694
that is music to my ears.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.531
I was sick of arguing with her,
fighting with her.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.065
I want to have fun with her

07:13.132 --> 07:15.368
and I want to enjoy myself
pulling birds,

07:15.434 --> 07:17.170
so for me, that is perfect.

07:17.236 --> 07:21.607
Oh, my God!
(they shriek)

07:22.975 --> 07:25.812
Oh, my God!
It is absolutely unbelievable.

07:25.878 --> 07:29.549
I'll show you to my room
and my double bed.

07:29.615 --> 07:34.253
Why the fuck do you get a double?
Oh, my God!

07:34.320 --> 07:37.890
How good is it?
It is fucking incredible.

07:39.892 --> 07:43.129
Fuck off.
(Sophie) Shit, this is amazing.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.598
I want to have fun,
let me hair down

07:45.665 --> 07:48.668
and fucking tash on with
loads of random wicked lads

07:48.734 --> 07:51.170
and probably Harold Bishop
for the banter.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.840
To Australia!
(all cheer)

08:00.880 --> 08:04.984
I just wanna fucking get out.
I can't wait.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.220
We're all just chilling,
having a drink,

08:07.286 --> 08:11.424
enjoying our new house and our new
surroundings when I hear a rumble.

08:15.394 --> 08:18.164
It sounds like
an ostentatious motorbike

08:18.231 --> 08:21.868
and the owner of which is guaranteed
to be a complete wanker.

08:21.934 --> 08:27.240
(doorbell rings with cheesy tune)

08:30.877 --> 08:35.214
And the owner of said motorbike
is our new boss.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.216
Steve Shearer?
Yeah.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.184
(all chant) Shearer, Shearer!

08:39.251 --> 08:41.854
It's looking like
Crocodile Dundee gone wrong

08:41.921 --> 08:43.722
and he smells like his horse.

08:45.925 --> 08:46.959
Today?
Today?

08:47.026 --> 08:48.094
Yes.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.162
We've just been on
a 24-hour flight.

08:50.229 --> 08:51.364
Bad fucking luck.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.666
You keep forgetting
we're here to work.

08:53.733 --> 08:54.934
I want to bang.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.945
(laughter)

09:12.752 --> 09:14.854
Drinks.
There you go.

09:15.922 --> 09:19.425
This time last year,
I was getting proposed to in Cancun.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.628
Now I'm in a fucking bedroom
with Scott and Gary.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.897
Are we gonna lay down
some ground rules?

09:24.964 --> 09:28.868
What kind of fucking ground rules?
Cos I'm girl and you're a boy.

09:28.935 --> 09:33.439
You're a lad as well.
Bit of lad banter definitely.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.808
I cannot go there.

09:35.875 --> 09:39.645
Can I? Nah. I...

09:39.712 --> 09:40.980
Gaz, no.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.849
I'm not gonna like,
bang in front of you.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.652
Cos that was me number one rule.
Was it?

09:46.719 --> 09:49.255
Please don't...
You can join in, by all means.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.290
You're all heart(!)

09:51.357 --> 09:55.061
It's so nice to feel like I can just
have a conversation with Gary

09:55.127 --> 09:58.264
without the pressures of Charlotte
or Ricci being there

09:58.331 --> 10:01.567
and I actually feel like,
in Australia, we could be friends.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.970
I just hope
he doesn't fall in love with us

10:04.036 --> 10:06.305
cos, let's face it,
it's inevitable.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.474
Come on, roomie.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.412
To Sydney!

10:22.989 --> 10:26.392
First night out. Let's show
Sydney what they've been missing.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.343
We get to the Kings Cross Hotel,
get in there, birds everywhere,

10:44.410 --> 10:45.444
the tunes are mint.

10:45.511 --> 10:47.947
This is what I imagined
Sydney being like.

10:52.918 --> 10:56.522
I'm just looking round at everyone
thinking, "We're back."

10:58.891 --> 11:01.894
It's my first night out,
back with single Vicky.

11:01.961 --> 11:05.965
She's having a laugh, having drinks,
necking drinks together. It's mint.

11:10.669 --> 11:13.406
This is not flirting though.
Or is it?

11:18.210 --> 11:21.881
She's confident, got banter,
flirtatious, in your face,

11:21.947 --> 11:25.117
and it's just so nice
to actually have her back.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.158
There's a huge elephant in the room.

11:32.224 --> 11:36.128
Charlotte is gonna arrive,
and where do her and Gary pick up?

11:46.305 --> 11:48.207
I do want to make it up with Holly

11:48.274 --> 11:51.477
and I do want us all
to be back to a family.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.148
I seriously think James
just thought,

11:56.215 --> 11:58.651
"I can apologise
and it will be fine."

12:05.124 --> 12:08.160
But no,
she wants to carry on the drama.

12:12.965 --> 12:16.635
It's as if she wants to
carry on this shit.

12:20.206 --> 12:23.809
It's gonna take a lot more than
one word to be my friend again.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.989
And fuck me, it's all just been
thrown back in me face.

12:39.024 --> 12:42.695
I can't believe this is the first
night and it's kicking off already.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.864
Charlotte and Gaz
haven't started yet.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.284
The Aussie birds
won't know what's hit 'em.

13:05.351 --> 13:08.888
Especially when they get
a bit of Scotty T's English pipe.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.829
In bounds Scotty fucking T,
the family is nearly complete.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.739
Now Scott's here,
the whole night's changed.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.240
Back to old ways.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.479
It's nice to have
a bit of competition.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.048
Let's see who can
get down under first.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.289
Beware, girls,
cos spunk is before you.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.496
Before Scott got there,
Gary was fun, family-orientated.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.199
He was having a laugh,
having heart-to-hearts.

13:53.265 --> 13:58.470
The minute Scott turns up,
he becomes a giant walking erection.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.920
Within two minutes,
we're both necking on.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.893
Scott hasn't even been to the house
and he's pulling.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.329
Get your priorities sorted.

14:25.831 --> 14:30.336
I'm pissed off, I'm jet-lagged,
I'm tired and I'm canny pissed.

14:30.402 --> 14:35.474
And I'm worried cos I don't want it
to get back to how it was.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.379
I've said hello to everyone,
got meself a drink,

14:40.446 --> 14:43.082
and within five minutes,
I'm taking a bird home.

14:43.148 --> 14:45.351
This is fucking mint.

14:48.887 --> 14:52.458
I'm banging a bird
in Charlotte's future bed.

14:52.524 --> 14:53.959
Hello!

14:54.026 --> 14:57.963
What speaks volumes is
Holly still cares about you.

14:59.565 --> 15:03.669
His lips are on mine, my lips are
on his, his tongue's in me mouth.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.305
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

15:08.841 --> 15:09.041
.

15:11.644 --> 15:11.844
.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.559
This is day one in Australia
and already it's kicking off.

15:27.626 --> 15:28.894
For fuck's sake.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.897
Enough of all this shit,

15:31.964 --> 15:35.334
it's time to get back to the house
and christen that shag pad.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.404
I've tried to make
an effort with Holly

15:38.470 --> 15:42.908
cos I want everyone to get on,
and she chucks it back in me face.

15:45.144 --> 15:48.647
With Gary and Scott pulling,
it's left to me to look after James

15:48.714 --> 15:50.983
and you can tell he's really upset.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.218
Basically I said to her,

15:53.285 --> 15:57.189
"Look, I apologise for last time,

15:57.256 --> 15:59.024
I was in the wrong."
Yeah.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.860
I says, "I shouldn't have done..."

16:01.927 --> 16:05.497
"I didn't ever intend
the way it was."

16:05.564 --> 16:08.901
I don't want James to be lonely
and I want to be there for him

16:08.967 --> 16:10.202
but I'm not a boy.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.971
I get so fucking worked up about it.

16:13.038 --> 16:16.542
Well, you're human,
at the end of the day.

16:16.608 --> 16:19.011
It's nothing to do with me
and I'm worked up.

16:19.078 --> 16:22.247
Ricci's not here
and I took James's friend away

16:22.314 --> 16:25.317
and because of that, I feel guilty,
I feel like shit.

16:25.384 --> 16:28.020
Lads don't give a fuck, like.
Cos they're lads!

16:28.087 --> 16:30.656
All they're bothered about...
Is pulling.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.091
I can't bond with them.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.927
Even if I was single,
I couldn't bond with them

16:34.993 --> 16:37.162
cos it's not normal lad craic.

16:37.229 --> 16:40.799
Yeah, you talk about fanny,
you want to pull birds.

16:40.866 --> 16:44.169
Like, fucking that's standard
but it's not everything.

16:44.236 --> 16:48.807
Vicky can understand why I'm angry
and why I'm upset.

16:48.874 --> 16:53.345
Everyone can see what's going on
and they're all sick of it.

16:53.412 --> 16:57.216
And I'm trying to make it better
but Holly's not having any of it.

16:57.282 --> 17:01.487
I just know that you're trying
and that's all it takes.

17:01.553 --> 17:04.690
No-one's gonna let you be on
your own when you're trying.

17:04.757 --> 17:10.095
And you know what speaks volumes is
that Holly still cares about you.

17:10.162 --> 17:13.732
Things aren't lost between you,
she's just super, super hurt.

17:21.906 --> 17:26.078
So, we get back to the house
and fuck it, I'm going to bed.

17:26.145 --> 17:29.415
I'm sick, I wanted to have
a good night with everyone

17:29.481 --> 17:31.049
have a laugh...

17:32.351 --> 17:34.253
...but nah, it's all fucked.

17:40.092 --> 17:42.361
I do want to be his friend again

17:42.428 --> 17:46.165
but the way he made me feel
and how horrible he was about me,

17:46.231 --> 17:47.366
I just can't do it.

17:47.433 --> 17:51.804
Vicky's gonna be his friend
but it doesn't mean I have to.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.614
Fuck me, this house is mint.

18:05.284 --> 18:08.821
Scotty T hasn't even seen his own
bed yet and he's got a girl back.

18:08.887 --> 18:12.558
How does he even know
which bed to go in?

18:12.624 --> 18:14.026
I couldn't give a fuck,

18:14.092 --> 18:16.995
I'm taking this bird into
the first bed I see.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.403
So I've got this bird in me bed

18:24.470 --> 18:26.572
and we're having
a game of Scrabble.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.187
I get back to the house,
get in the shag pad,

18:42.254 --> 18:43.489
this amazing sea view.

18:48.827 --> 18:52.164
And all she wants to do is talk.
The graft begins now.

18:57.836 --> 19:01.907
Eventually the groundwork pays off
and I'm down under.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.876
(Australian accent) G'day, mate.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.756
As a fucking really good housemate,
I opt to take the sofa,

19:17.823 --> 19:19.091
I take one for the team.

19:21.226 --> 19:24.930
Already on the fucking sofa
and it's only the first night.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.063
First night, bash!

20:04.369 --> 20:07.839
Fuck right off!
I'm not driving that piece of shit.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.441
Since I'm in Australia,

20:09.508 --> 20:13.745
I do understand you can't get more
Australian than a fucking ute.

20:13.812 --> 20:16.748
Get in!
Whoa!

20:19.885 --> 20:23.522
I can't. Oh, my God.
It's hurting me arms.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.891
It's like being at the gym.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.160
Turn that way.
I know.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.764
This is absolutely appalling.

20:34.232 --> 20:37.769
What if Charlotte comes back?
I don't know how she's gonna feel.

20:43.909 --> 20:49.748
I feel like she's just gonna come,
blank you for a bit...

20:49.815 --> 20:51.149
Say the odd word, yeah.

20:51.216 --> 20:52.918
Say the odd words, whatever.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.454
I'm happy with that though,
with being civil.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.923
Eventually we'll get back
to having a laugh

20:57.990 --> 21:00.325
and I get to pull girls
without the hassle.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.493
That is what I want.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.674
So me and Vicky rock up
to this party bus.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.380
The work is our usual Geordie Tours.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.682
Tashing on, getting fucked.
Brilliant.

21:25.751 --> 21:30.055
Australia's party bus knocks Anna's
piddley little bus out the water.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.558
It makes it look like afternoon tea
with your fucking grandma.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.361
And this is fresher's week.
It's fucking amazing.

21:36.428 --> 21:37.429
Come on!

21:39.965 --> 21:43.368
Scott's running round like
a giant vibrator in a blonde wig,

21:43.435 --> 21:45.871
he's in his element,
buzzing his tits off.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.108
This is what a party bus should be.

21:51.476 --> 21:56.214
Everyone's having a mint time,
vodka's getting thrown about,

21:56.281 --> 21:57.315
job well done.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.958
It's our first
Saturday night out in Sydney

22:07.025 --> 22:09.528
so there's only one place to go.
Pasha.

22:11.163 --> 22:15.434
Scott and Vicky still aren't back.
It's Saturday night. I'm going out.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.406
This is to not being at work
on a Saturday night.

22:21.473 --> 22:24.843
Unlucky, Scott and Vicky.
And our first cheers.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.446
All I'm worried about now is
Charlotte coming

22:27.512 --> 22:29.147
and ending up in my room.

22:29.214 --> 22:30.515
Cheers.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.556
I'm in Sydney, I'm newly single,
I'm on a fucking party bus.

23:11.623 --> 23:13.024
Who needs more drink?

23:13.091 --> 23:15.427
I'm getting fucking
marriage proposals,

23:15.494 --> 23:17.963
cocks thrust in me face,
drinks handed to us.

23:18.029 --> 23:20.799
Long time since
I've had a night out like this.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.603
If I'm gonna tash on,
this is the fucking place to do it.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.008
I spot a man
and he's making eye contact with me,

23:30.075 --> 23:33.812
I'm making eye contact with him
and we gravitate towards each other.

23:42.921 --> 23:46.158
And his tongue's in me fucking mouth
and it's canny wicked.

23:46.224 --> 23:49.528
I am tashing on! Single Vicky
is getting her first tash on!

23:56.802 --> 23:59.404
God, I don't know.
I could do anything I wanted.

23:59.471 --> 24:00.572
This is amazing.

24:00.639 --> 24:03.575
I've just got so much excitement
and nervous energy,

24:03.642 --> 24:06.044
my lips have got
a fucking mind of their own.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.948
Gonna be like a tashing on tornado.
Nobody's gonna know what hit it.

24:13.084 --> 24:14.119
He's shushing me.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.087
All she wants is attention.

24:16.154 --> 24:17.656
(screams)

24:17.722 --> 24:21.359
The shag pad's mine tonight so
straight up the stairway to heaven.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.797
It's so weird
seeing Vicky on the pull again.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.098
Have a threesome.

24:27.165 --> 24:29.835
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

24:31.703 --> 24:31.903
.

24:34.472 --> 24:34.673
.

24:49.588 --> 24:52.791
So, we're in the club
and it's like a massive circus show.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.230
I love Sydney.

25:00.999 --> 25:04.436
Tonight for me is all about
just enjoying meself.

25:06.037 --> 25:09.908
Me and Sophie are on our way
to getting very, very drunk.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.660
Luckily, me and Gary are
good friends.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.562
Sophie's good friends with James

25:30.629 --> 25:34.232
so we're kind of keeping apart
and distracting each other.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.977
I don't love Ricci any more

25:46.044 --> 25:48.613
and we're not together
and I'm single

25:48.680 --> 25:50.749
and I should be able
to do what I want.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.584
But I'm a fucking girl.

25:52.651 --> 25:57.822
I'm a real person with real emotions
and I loved him for fucking ages

25:57.889 --> 25:59.524
and I can't just turn that off.

26:07.198 --> 26:11.069
I wish I fucking could,
but I can't.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.872
And tashing on with this random
just proved that.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.908
Fuck!

26:24.749 --> 26:27.986
The first time pulling for Vicky
was always gonna be hard

26:28.053 --> 26:30.655
when she's just got out
of a serious engagement

26:30.722 --> 26:32.290
but it will get easier.

26:47.238 --> 26:50.275
Scotty!
Scott's turned up, there's no Vicky.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.683
This might just be too soon

26:58.750 --> 27:00.986
after she's just had
a break up with Ricci.

27:05.991 --> 27:10.829
Why is that all our girls do?
Cry, neck on, cry, neck on.

27:10.895 --> 27:11.863
Fuck's sake.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.972
It did upset me last night
seeing him crying

27:21.039 --> 27:23.508
and I didn't realise
he would get that upset.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.877
I do need to clear the air with him.

27:30.415 --> 27:34.285
I'm thinking, "Shit, I just don't
want another repeat of last night."

27:40.692 --> 27:42.560
This isn't looking good at all.

27:45.797 --> 27:48.333
He's patronising me,
he's shushing me.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.868
(screams)

27:49.934 --> 27:53.705
Oh, my God. I'm just
absolutely fucking furious.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.106
Boom, it's kicked off.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.909
Holly's getting excited,
her hands are raised.

27:58.810 --> 28:02.781
All she wants is attention
and people to feel sorry for her.

28:02.847 --> 28:06.017
(screams)

28:06.084 --> 28:08.420
And then the next thing I know,

28:08.486 --> 28:11.056
I'm getting escorted out
through the fire exit.

28:12.957 --> 28:16.494
I'm in Sydney's best night club

28:16.561 --> 28:19.531
and 20 minutes later
I'm getting kicked out of it.

28:19.597 --> 28:22.600
And we're not gonna be
allowed back thanks to me.

28:44.456 --> 28:45.457
To be honest,

28:45.523 --> 28:48.927
I don't give a fuck what's
happening between James and Holly.

28:48.993 --> 28:52.030
All I care about is me
going radge in Australia.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.104
For once, it's not me
involved in all the drama.

28:59.170 --> 29:01.739
Fuck this fighting,
I'm a lover not a fighter.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.608
I'm gonna get a bird and fuck off.

29:09.347 --> 29:11.015
"What's your name, darling?"

29:11.082 --> 29:13.551
"Doesn't matter,
you're getting Gaz'd."

29:16.654 --> 29:18.089
Everyone's ready to leave

29:18.156 --> 29:20.758
and I haven't even thought about
nesting a bird

29:20.825 --> 29:23.461
cos of the kick-offs
and I've got a power minute

29:23.528 --> 29:25.230
to find someone to go home with.

29:43.681 --> 29:46.251
Scott's got the shag pad tonight.

29:50.588 --> 29:53.491
Vicky's already in bed
so I can't have my double bed,

29:53.558 --> 29:55.560
I can't go in the girls' room.

29:57.495 --> 30:00.598
I need a fucking bed.
James, I need your room.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.736
Tonight's been absolutely shit

30:04.802 --> 30:08.740
and to top it all off,
I can't even sleep in me own bed

30:08.806 --> 30:11.376
cos fucking Gaz has brought
a bird back.

30:17.215 --> 30:21.052
The shag pad's mine tonight so it's
straight up the stairway to heaven

30:21.119 --> 30:24.122
which just happens to end
at my fucking bell-end.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.133
In me head I'm thinking,

30:35.200 --> 30:39.771
"Shit, I'm banging a bird in
Charlotte's future bed."

30:42.607 --> 30:43.608
Fuck.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.079
Put the cuffs on us, guilty.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.784
(Sophie) Is that my Charlotte?
(screams)

30:52.850 --> 30:56.487
Thank fuck she's here.
I am fucking buzzing.

30:57.288 --> 31:00.658
It's Charlotte. She's back.
I think he's a bit ugly now.

31:00.725 --> 31:03.895
Guess who's fucking back!

31:03.962 --> 31:06.397
All I hear is someone kicking off.

31:06.464 --> 31:08.733
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:10.768 --> 31:10.969
.

31:13.504 --> 31:13.705
.

31:46.271 --> 31:48.640
Me and Gary haven't spoken
since last time

31:48.706 --> 31:50.775
but I'm in
a much better place now.

31:53.611 --> 31:57.815
I've met someone who I care about
but it's still really new

31:57.882 --> 32:00.918
so I can't stand
the thought of anyone ruining it.

32:16.534 --> 32:20.271
I wake up
and Holly's nowhere to be seen.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.745
I know for a fact that
sheep-shagging Steve

32:27.812 --> 32:31.249
is gonna have something to say
for Holly's actions last night.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.217
That means one thing,

32:33.284 --> 32:37.388
Holly's lost her place in the house
and she's getting a bollocking.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.260
(doorbell rings with cheesy tune)
Hello?

32:42.327 --> 32:43.728
Hello!

32:43.795 --> 32:47.432
I hear shouting and straight away
I know exactly who it is.

32:49.167 --> 32:53.604
(plays "Fur Elise")

32:53.671 --> 32:54.806
(screams)

32:54.872 --> 33:00.745
Out the blue, I just hear that
screeching, screaming, stupid voice

33:00.812 --> 33:02.647
and it's Charlotte, she's back.

33:05.016 --> 33:10.121
Seeing Gary again, it's not weird,
it doesn't feel like anything,

33:10.188 --> 33:13.658
it just... feels like nothing.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.060
How are you?
Sophie's coming down as well.

33:16.127 --> 33:17.362
I'm nervous.

33:17.428 --> 33:19.897
Is she speaking to us?
Are we not speaking?

33:19.964 --> 33:23.568
I was like... (groans)
But I still see the girl.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.903
How you doing?
Where's Sophie and Holly?

33:25.970 --> 33:28.673
(Sophie) Is that my Charlotte?
(screams)

33:29.207 --> 33:32.643
Thank fuck she's here.
I am fucking buzzing.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.879
How are ya?
(Gaz) Welcome back.

33:35.813 --> 33:38.349
This is when my time here starts.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.418
Been going a little bit wild.

33:40.485 --> 33:43.054
Weirdly, the atmosphere is sound.

33:43.121 --> 33:46.858
Let's see how long they last before
they rip each other's heads off.

33:46.924 --> 33:48.960
No-one's slept in
their own beds yet.

33:49.026 --> 33:52.764
(Gary's had sex in your bed.)

33:52.830 --> 33:54.499
Has he?

33:54.565 --> 33:58.002
Well, that's great(!)
That was a really...

33:58.069 --> 34:00.538
Welcome home!

34:00.605 --> 34:02.573
Same shit, different day.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.976
I'm not arsed,
just change the sheets.

34:05.042 --> 34:08.846
How do you feel about him?
It's just weird.

34:08.913 --> 34:11.882
Like, it's weird.
It's always weird seeing him.

34:11.949 --> 34:15.485
I don't really feel any...
I don't have any time for him.

34:15.553 --> 34:19.357
I think he's a bit ugly now.
Oh, have you gone that way?

34:19.424 --> 34:22.659
He makes us feel a bit repulsed.
Mmm. Right.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.295
Sometimes that can happen.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.931
You can fall completely out of love.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.967
This is a real progression
for Charlotte.

34:30.034 --> 34:33.704
I feel like it's a sign that she
might finally be getting over Gary.

34:33.771 --> 34:37.007
I just can't believe
he's had sex in me bed.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.411
Why not? Why does anything
about that shock ya?

34:40.478 --> 34:42.547
Did he know
I'd be sleeping in it?

34:42.612 --> 34:47.284
I am sick to death of Charlotte and
Gary and that silly relationship.

34:47.351 --> 34:50.688
For her sake, I hope she walks
away from him in Australia

34:50.755 --> 34:52.356
and never speak to him again.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.059
Just tell him
you want him to clean your sheets.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.828
I'd rather not mention it.

34:56.893 --> 34:59.330
I don't want any excuses
to talk to him.

35:08.206 --> 35:11.943
We've been in Oz a couple days now
and we haven't been to the beach yet

35:12.009 --> 35:14.345
so it's in the cars
and off to Manley.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.283
In Australia, it's mad.

35:19.350 --> 35:23.187
You can rock up to ten fit birds
playing Volleyball and get involved.

35:23.254 --> 35:26.924
In Newcastle, if you did that,
you'd get a back hand.

35:32.129 --> 35:36.000
Evidentially, all they're interested
in is half-clad bikini babes.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.568
Who'd have thought it(?)

35:42.473 --> 35:44.742
I tried to kiss someone
the other night.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.878
I was waiting for this to happen.

35:46.944 --> 35:49.013
I can't even remember
who kissed who.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.682
I know he was leaning in,
I know I was leaning in,

35:51.749 --> 35:53.885
then all of a sudden,
we were tashing on

35:53.951 --> 35:57.455
and I couldn't tell you a fucking
thing other than I felt guilty.

35:57.522 --> 35:58.956
And I just felt like shit.

35:59.023 --> 36:01.025
Your first time's
gonna be like that.

36:03.928 --> 36:07.265
I burst into tears like a fucking...
Did the boys see you cry?

36:07.331 --> 36:10.067
I cried in front of him.
What will he thought of ya?

36:10.134 --> 36:12.403
Probably that he's
that shit of a kisser.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.505
Embarrassing.
Thanks, Charlotte.

36:14.572 --> 36:19.277
I'm pleased I can count on you. I'd
rather tell Scott again, you prick.

36:20.945 --> 36:23.781
I thought I could just act like
Donald Long Schlong

36:23.848 --> 36:27.852
and neck on with loads of people,
but I'm just a Timmy Tiny Testes.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.121
The tables have definitely turned.

36:30.187 --> 36:33.524
I find meself sitting on
this beach, enjoying the view,

36:33.591 --> 36:37.428
getting relationship advice
from fucking Charlotte.

36:37.495 --> 36:38.996
It's like the Twilight Zone.

36:39.063 --> 36:43.868
We're going out tonight
and I'm gonna give it another go.

36:43.935 --> 36:47.638
What about just a talk and a flirt?
Let's just roll with the punches.

36:47.705 --> 36:51.108
Let's just...
(both) See how it goes.

36:53.144 --> 36:56.547
Towel hug!
Fuck. You creep.

36:56.614 --> 36:57.648
(both laugh)

37:04.355 --> 37:07.858
I'm going to go to sleep
cos I've been on a 24-hour flight.

37:07.925 --> 37:10.828
I'm not gonna go out tonight either.
Why-aye.

37:10.895 --> 37:15.700
I'm not, I need me sleep. I haven't
had any for a day and a half.

37:15.766 --> 37:18.803
I'm not gonna get drunk
and kiss loads of other lads

37:18.869 --> 37:22.573
or jump around like a tit like Scott
cos I'm just not in the mood

37:22.640 --> 37:28.512
because sometimes I can't always be
happy just like every other human.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.959
Tonight we're off to
a backpacker bar

37:42.026 --> 37:44.562
and I can't help but feel
a little bit dubious.

37:44.629 --> 37:47.431
We're gonna stick out
like sore fucking thumbs.

37:55.506 --> 37:58.376
It's our first night out
in Australia without Holly

37:58.442 --> 37:59.977
and I'm actually buzzing.

38:00.044 --> 38:02.413
I'm finally gonna get
to enjoy meself.

38:04.682 --> 38:08.452
Every night out we've had until now
has revolved around James and Holly

38:08.519 --> 38:10.688
and ultimately ended
in confrontation.

38:10.755 --> 38:14.158
In her absence, James is flourishing,
he's the old him.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.961
He's dancing, having a laugh,
having fun

38:17.028 --> 38:18.295
and it's so nice to see.

38:26.270 --> 38:29.774
It's backpacker night
so I'm going out in me flat trainers

38:29.840 --> 38:33.177
and everyone knows backpackers
can't afford heels.

38:33.244 --> 38:37.848
That's why they all wear flats,
so I'm mingling with backpackers.

38:39.850 --> 38:43.421
Me and Soph venture off into the club
like intrepid explorers

38:43.487 --> 38:46.957
searching for the native animal,
the illusive Australian tail.

38:52.430 --> 38:55.366
They're all disgusting
and I can't even pull in here

38:55.433 --> 38:57.168
so I don't know how Vicky could.

39:04.308 --> 39:07.378
In the end, me and Soph
actually strike quite lucky

39:07.445 --> 39:09.480
and get two reasonable looking lads.

39:13.150 --> 39:16.921
Vicky wants to pull but she hasn't
got the whole power herself

39:16.987 --> 39:20.858
so I'm like,
"Right, I will wing-woman you."

39:20.925 --> 39:23.894
Vicky's living the dream,
blonde haired lad one side,

39:23.961 --> 39:25.629
dark haired lad the other.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.966
I was thinking, "Is Vicky gonna have
her first threesome?"

39:37.975 --> 39:41.946
Hello, hello, hello!

39:42.012 --> 39:47.318
I'm asleep and all I hear
is someone kicking off.

39:47.384 --> 39:50.788
Guess who's fucking back!

39:50.855 --> 39:52.757
What the fuck?

39:55.826 --> 39:58.028
Hello, is anyone in, like, or what?!

40:00.965 --> 40:02.466
Hello?

40:02.533 --> 40:03.801
(screams)

40:03.868 --> 40:07.738
Oi, oi!
What the hell?

40:07.805 --> 40:10.040
(laughs)

40:10.107 --> 40:12.109
This is fucking Jay!

40:12.176 --> 40:16.147
What the hell?! (screams)
What are you doing?!

40:16.213 --> 40:18.549
Is this some kind of
fucked-up nightmare?

40:18.616 --> 40:22.286
Come on, have a drink.

40:22.353 --> 40:23.921
Jay is back.

40:23.988 --> 40:25.256
(both) Hey!

40:34.131 --> 40:36.567
It's so weird seeing Vicky
on the pull again

40:36.634 --> 40:39.036
and she was like,
"Which one should I pick?"

40:39.103 --> 40:41.839
"The dark one, the blonde one."
What the fuck?

40:41.906 --> 40:43.307
Just have a threesome.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.182
I've only just got to Oz,

40:51.248 --> 40:54.285
I don't want to go around
breaking hearts straight away

40:54.351 --> 40:58.189
so no chance I'm tashing on with
either in front of the other.

41:14.471 --> 41:18.108
Me and Jay have come up with a plan
and to be fucking honest,

41:18.175 --> 41:19.877
I can't wait to see the reaction.

41:19.944 --> 41:22.580
James, come here a minute.
Come with us, right.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.082
I've been by meself,
shitting meself.

41:27.785 --> 41:31.222
I saw something from the window,
will you please come up?

41:31.288 --> 41:35.259
You're full of shit.
I'm not, I swear to God.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.362
I've been by meself and no-one's
tried to help us at all.

41:38.429 --> 41:42.366
Please come upstairs.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.870
He was over there by the window!

41:47.872 --> 41:50.674
(laughter)

41:58.482 --> 42:01.218
I'm back in
the fucking Geordie Shore house

42:01.285 --> 42:02.953
and I'm fucking mortal.

42:06.790 --> 42:09.526
Charlotte pure had our lives.
It's fucking Jay.

42:20.604 --> 42:23.974
I've finally got
a decent mate back in the house.

42:25.776 --> 42:31.782
The silverback, the great old man,
the daddy of all Geordie Shores

42:31.849 --> 42:33.250
has came back.

42:33.317 --> 42:36.153
(laughter)

42:37.187 --> 42:41.125
I haven't got a fucking bed,
where do you want me to go?

42:41.725 --> 42:44.094
Scott's fucking flipped.
(smashing)

42:44.161 --> 42:47.464
It must be my lucky day,
plenty tashing.

42:49.466 --> 42:52.403
I have succeeded.
You're a stupid little prick.

42:52.469 --> 42:55.005
What have I done?
We can't be around each other.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.641
He banged his bird
in Charlotte's piss.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.910
I'll clean it.
(screams)

43:01.245 --> 43:03.614
I really miss Mitch

43:03.681 --> 43:07.117
and everyday it seems like
it's just getting harder.

43:07.184 --> 43:08.819
Three girls, one bed, night.

43:08.886 --> 43:11.622
He had a slumber party.
Is he the gay best friend?

43:11.689 --> 43:14.525
It is weird not getting
Charlotte's attention 24/7.

43:14.591 --> 43:17.728
(screams)
I fucking hate emus.

43:42.686 --> 43:42.886
.
