WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:07.072
- What are you doing?
- Bagging.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.241
Okay, Mr. Kim,
if you don't care about me...

00:09.243 --> 00:10.309
I don't.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.044
At least care about
the sea turtles.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.279
Did you not read
the pamphlet I gave you?

00:14.281 --> 00:15.681
No. I threw in garbage.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.551
First of all, that should have
gone in the recycling,

00:19.553 --> 00:21.020
And more importantly,

00:21.022 --> 00:23.422
Sea turtles are dying
because of your plastic bags.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.424
- My bag?
- Yeah, your bag, their bags,

00:25.426 --> 00:28.327
I am boycotting
all plastic bags.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.562
Hmm. So, how you carry?

00:32.733 --> 00:36.735
I will be like the majestic
sea turtle and adapt.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.405
Did you know that

00:39.407 --> 00:42.041
Plastic bags kill
more sea turtles than sharks?

00:43.077 --> 00:46.278
You mean, uh, bag kill shark,
or shark kill turtle?

00:46.680 --> 00:49.381
Either way, it is a travesty,
and it needs to be stopped.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.650
Oh, you right. I help.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.687
Take bread, put in hand.
I insist.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.990
Turtle very important.
Like this.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.224
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.427
Take a banana
and put it in the pocket.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.928
- All right.
- It's tight...

01:02.930 --> 01:04.029
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:04.031 --> 01:06.131
You can have a little bit more
inside here,

01:06.133 --> 01:07.966
Use other hand, too.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.034
Here.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.970
And a can under chin...
(chuckles)

01:11.972 --> 01:14.073
Okay. That's unflattering.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.707
Again you saving
the sea turtle?

01:15.709 --> 01:17.543
- You understand me.
- I get door.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.279
Okay, well, always
a nice casual visit.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.182
- Okay, see you.
- Bye-bye.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.018
- He not gonna make it home.
- Not even close.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.087
(theme music playing)

01:48.709 --> 01:50.142
Thanks.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.312
There he is, Mr. Fitness.
Making us all look bad.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.180
Hey, I'd drive a car
if you paid me more.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.482
And take all this
away from you?

01:56.484 --> 01:58.550
The fresh air,
the exercise, the...

01:59.420 --> 02:01.687
- (sighs)
- joie de vivre. (chuckles)

02:01.689 --> 02:02.955
And it's fast.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.457
My average speed
on the trip in was...

02:05.459 --> 02:06.625
Nine hundred kilometers
an hour.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.427
Ooh! That's my boy.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.129
I think that's just the
number of calories I burned.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.396
(chuckles)

02:11.398 --> 02:14.099
- No, I think it's just 9:00.
- Still, you're on time.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.535
I used to bike
all the time back home,

02:16.537 --> 02:19.004
Zipping through the streets.
(chuckles)

02:19.006 --> 02:21.206
"there goes the town bike,"
they'd say.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.242
Not in that way.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.444
The bike was actually shared
by everyone in the town.

02:25.446 --> 02:29.248
And, boy, did I get around.
Again, not in that way.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.350
You should totally get one.
We could be bike buddies.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.119
I don't know,

02:34.121 --> 02:37.022
There's a whole big city bike
culture I don't understand.

02:37.024 --> 02:40.025
The gears, the bells,
the helmet, it's a lot.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.093
It's a bike.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.165
(doorbell rings)

02:46.167 --> 02:47.566
Hi, umma. Hi, appa.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.536
Hi, Janet.
Hi, Janet's dirty laundry.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.104
Hi, Janet.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.573
<i>Yah,</i> something wrong
with you own washing machine?

02:54.575 --> 02:56.708
No, I just miss spending time
with you guys.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.711
Oh, miss spending time
with the free hydro,

02:59.713 --> 03:01.914
Free detergent, the free food.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.348
Appa, don't be mean.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.584
Yeah, appa. That's not
award-winning behavior.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.685
I'd expect more from

03:06.687 --> 03:08.153
The moss park
business person of the year.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.555
- What, you hear something?
- No.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.622
Janet.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.990
I just have
a good feeling about it.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.292
Don't jinx.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.360
They announce tomorrow.
I have good feeling, too.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.062
Just stop talking, hmm?

03:17.064 --> 03:19.064
I never win,
whole thing is just stupid.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.365
Then why can't we
talk about it?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.934
No more talking
until tomorrow.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.202
In general,
or about the award?

03:23.404 --> 03:25.771
- Just stop.
- Janet, we go upstairs now.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.140
Make space
on the don't touch wall

03:28.142 --> 03:30.042
For, you know, something.

03:30.277 --> 03:33.512
- Like an award?
- I can still hear you.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.617
(bicycle bell rings)

03:39.453 --> 03:40.519
I got a surprise for you.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.555
No... What is that?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.990
A buddy of mine
fixes up old bikes.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.291
I got it
for practically nothing.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.559
I have to pay you
something for it.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.429
Oh, forget it.
It was like 20 bucks.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.197
Forty with the new rims,
but...

03:52.199 --> 03:54.299
- So, $40?
- Well, it was $80 total,

03:54.301 --> 03:57.569
- But it's a gift so, $45. $50.
- (bicycle bell rings)

03:57.571 --> 03:59.605
(chuckles) I love it.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.173
Oh, I almost forgot.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.643
The helmet was $30.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.178
But seriously,
don't worry about it.

04:07.982 --> 04:10.515
Uh, are these eggs free-range?

04:10.517 --> 04:12.417
(sighs) not free.
Price is on the top.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.021
No, like, are the chickens
kept in cages?

04:16.023 --> 04:18.223
(sighs) we don't have
chicken here.

04:18.525 --> 04:21.193
Do the farmers keep
the chickens inside cages?

04:21.195 --> 04:23.662
Oh, good question.
You go to farm, you find out.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.165
Uh, these are local.
Very fresh. You will like.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.134
Oh, okay, thanks.

04:29.136 --> 04:33.105
- Oh, Mr. Chin, good morning.
- It certainly is.

04:33.107 --> 04:37.476
And as secretary of the moss
park business association,

04:37.478 --> 04:39.411
I am happy to say someone here

04:39.413 --> 04:42.514
Is about to have
a very rewarding morning.

04:42.516 --> 04:46.285
(chuckles) it's nothing.
I just try to work hard.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.353
- Congratulations, Mr. Kim.
- Oh, thank you...

04:48.355 --> 04:51.590
Oh, no, the winner
isn't Mr. Kim, it's Mrs. Kim.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.160
What?

04:55.162 --> 04:57.029
- No.
- Oh, yes.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.263
You both received votes,

04:58.265 --> 05:00.899
But Mrs. Kim blew away
all the competition.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.001
Congratulations, Mrs. Kim.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.503
Well, it must be some mistake.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.671
No mistake.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.440
And believe me,
I asked for several recounts.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.975
(sighs)

05:10.978 --> 05:12.444
Congratulations on you award.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.379
- (Mr. Chin chuckles)
- our award.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.182
She's right, you should both
be very proud.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.584
But mostly Mrs. Kim.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.321
(umma sighs)

05:25.125 --> 05:27.959
You using the washing machine?
I wanna do a load.

05:27.961 --> 05:28.994
No, I did mine at my parents'.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.062
Sweet.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.339
- What?
- Your load is one shirt?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.074
Yeah. That's all that's dirty.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.476
Then wait until
other things are dirty.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.611
But I wanna wear that shirt.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.348
Is this the first time
you've done this?

05:50.451 --> 05:51.616
Yes.

05:52.486 --> 05:55.153
This is why our hydro bill
is so crazy.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.221
But this way, I don't risk

05:56.223 --> 05:57.522
Ruining my shirt
with other colors.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.024
Your shirts are all black.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.425
Because I carefully wash them.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.427
Individually.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.029
Fine!

06:11.505 --> 06:13.138
- Happy?
- Not really.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.206
Gerald: Hmm.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.316
My wallet is in there.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.318
Oh, god...

06:33.160 --> 06:34.760
Life in the bike lane,
am I right?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.662
Hey, you are looking
a lot better today.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.930
I think you're really
getting the hang of it.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.432
Oh, yeah. (chuckles)

06:40.434 --> 06:43.535
I mean, a lot of people yell
when you ride on the sidewalk.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.638
And I might have something
called saddle rash,

06:46.640 --> 06:48.974
But I think I'm hitting
my stride. And just loving it.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.709
Yeah, it really gets
the heart pumpin'.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.711
(chuckling)
is that what that is?

06:52.713 --> 06:55.013
Usually, I bring a fresh shirt
to change into.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.114
Oh, I tried that,
but it looks like

06:56.116 --> 06:58.717
The sweat went
right through the backpack.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.951
- (pants)
- whoa.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.420
It's weird because
I know the ac is on,

07:01.422 --> 07:03.255
But I feel like
I'm getting hotter.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.424
It's a cool-down period,
you'll get used to it.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.658
It's so great, right?

07:08.128 --> 07:09.194
So great. (chuckles)

07:09.196 --> 07:10.262
(chuckles)

07:20.607 --> 07:21.940
(knocking on door)

07:21.942 --> 07:23.308
- Janet: Hey.
- Hey.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.578
So, I was thinking about
our conversation last night,

07:26.980 --> 07:29.581
And maybe, we just need to be
more considerate?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.450
Yeah, I totally agree.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.984
Which is why
I'm doing all my laundry

07:32.986 --> 07:34.286
In cold water from now on.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.987
Great.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.356
Yeah, because our hydro bill
is so crazy.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.459
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.526
And I know how you love

07:41.528 --> 07:42.961
To take those really
long, hot baths.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.531
And then shower,
like, right afterwards.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.166
To wash off the bubbles.

07:48.402 --> 07:50.001
And that's no problem.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.704
But you know what would be
super considerate?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.573
Is if you could clean your
hair from the drain

07:54.575 --> 07:57.175
And the wall when you're done?

07:58.278 --> 07:59.344
Yeah, of course.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.313
That would be awesome.
Thank you.

08:01.448 --> 08:04.082
You know what else would be,
like, so considerate?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.183
Mmm?

08:05.185 --> 08:08.019
If after shaving,
you could clean the sink

08:08.021 --> 08:10.222
And the floor,
for some reason.

08:10.224 --> 08:12.157
- Done.
- Hmm.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.026
And before I forget,

08:15.028 --> 08:16.695
Did you make
scrambled eggs recently?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.196
Not today.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.564
Oh, no, they're definitely
a few days old.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.099
I'm soaking the pan, okay?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.901
Okay, well,
while the pan soaks,

08:22.903 --> 08:24.503
Maybe you can clean up
your used tea bags

08:24.505 --> 08:26.104
From our coffee table,

08:26.106 --> 08:27.939
And, I don't know, everywhere.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.241
I'm reusing them.

08:29.243 --> 08:32.110
It's called being good
to the environment.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.346
Unlike your one shirt
killing-the-planet wash!

08:36.316 --> 08:39.484
My pants and wallet
were in there, too!

08:40.254 --> 08:42.287
Again, they shut you out.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.256
What is this,
10 years in a row, now?

08:44.258 --> 08:46.658
Oh, I'm not counting.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.128
Who won this year?
Oh, let me guess, a woman.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.396
Why you say that?

08:51.398 --> 08:52.564
Oh, please.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.267
Business association,
so politically correct.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.335
They don't give awards to
people who deserve them,

08:57.337 --> 09:00.505
- Just the flavor of the month.
- What flavor?

09:00.507 --> 09:05.210
It's all optics, to gain favor
with the city. It's a racket!

09:05.212 --> 09:09.281
Actual, Mrs. Kim
is win award this year.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.418
Well, in that case, they've
made an admirable choice.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.153
Besides, we've all
won this award.

09:15.489 --> 09:18.023
It's good for a woman
to win it, right?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.357
I never win.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.595
Not recently,
but you must have...

09:25.299 --> 09:26.364
Never, never?

09:27.434 --> 09:28.500
Oh.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.269
Mrs. Mehta:
You're a celebrity, Mrs. Kim.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.637
Oh, that's a good price
on cauliflower.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.072
Yeah. It's just
community paper.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.540
You can keep, I have lots.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.509
So proud of you.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.444
Though Mr. Kim
doesn't look too happy.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.713
I think he think
he is going to win this year.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.182
Don't let his disappointment

09:44.184 --> 09:46.117
Take away
from your achievement.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.686
This store wouldn't be
half the success it is

09:47.688 --> 09:48.987
Without you.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.689
- Yeah, you right.
- (chuckles)

09:52.659 --> 09:55.327
Well, I must be going.
Where's my husband?

09:56.129 --> 09:58.463
- He left.
- Of course he did.

09:58.465 --> 10:01.466
"Marry a Mehta," they said.
"he'll take care of you."

10:01.468 --> 10:03.168
I had servants in India.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.235
Now, I live with a man

10:04.237 --> 10:06.071
Who microwaves
cheese on toast.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.582
Hey, everything okay?

10:17.584 --> 10:18.717
I'm just so mad right now.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.552
What's wrong with people
in this city?

10:20.554 --> 10:22.587
- What happened?
- (sighs) my bike was stolen.

10:22.589 --> 10:23.655
Oh.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.657
That sucks.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.158
And I so looked forward
to that morning ride.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.294
I mean, yes, sometimes,
it was a challenge,

10:29.296 --> 10:30.595
But, boy,
did I love that challenge.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.197
And somebody
stole that from me.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.298
(Shannon sighs)

10:33.300 --> 10:34.499
We could try
getting you a new one.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.734
I mean, probably
not for the same price...

10:35.736 --> 10:38.036
I'm just too mad to even
think about it right now.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.704
I get it, I'm sorry.

10:39.706 --> 10:40.972
Hey, you look nice today.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.309
- Not now, Terence!
- Okay.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.813
- That was a bit harsh.
- It's a tough city.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.286
Excuse me,
do you have apple pay?

10:55.288 --> 10:57.155
- Appa pay?
- Yes.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.456
Why would I pay?

10:58.458 --> 11:02.193
Oh, no, I'll pay,
but with apple pay.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.196
We take cash
and debit over $15.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.232
- Great, thank you.
- (sighs)

11:07.968 --> 11:09.100
(cash register beeping)

11:09.102 --> 11:10.268
Oh...

11:11.405 --> 11:13.505
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.142
Yeah. Store wouldn't be "half
as successful" without her.

11:17.144 --> 11:20.145
Of course it would be.
Exactly half.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.313
We both work hard, together.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.517
But Mrs. Kim
work so much harder.

11:25.519 --> 11:29.654
I only open store,
close store, go to wholesale,

11:30.057 --> 11:33.091
But Mrs. Kim, she rearrange
cookie on the shelf,

11:33.093 --> 11:34.659
And that make all difference.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.628
I do more than that.

11:36.630 --> 11:39.564
I get involve in community,
work with other store.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.466
I am kind to customer,
not like you.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.734
Maybe that's why I win.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.503
Only reason you win
is because you is woman.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.408
I'm going to go.

11:51.311 --> 11:55.246
So, thank you both, equally.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.650
When I say you is a woman...

11:58.652 --> 12:00.618
You don't even care
about the award.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.053
Why would you?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.688
Award is so stupid,

12:03.690 --> 12:05.957
Only dumb woman
like me can win!

12:05.959 --> 12:07.125
I not say you is dumb.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.560
You care about award so much.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.128
Here, you take. Take! Take!

12:10.130 --> 12:12.430
- You win, you keep.
- No, no. I don't deserve.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.065
- You take it.
- No, no.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.133
- Take!
- No!

12:15.135 --> 12:16.668
Oh, fine. Nobody wants!

12:20.507 --> 12:23.675
<i>Yeobo! Yeobo!</i>

12:26.413 --> 12:28.046
My card...

12:32.119 --> 12:34.753
(clicks tongue) appa pay.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.163
See, a weekday picnic
is possible.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.032
All it takes is a little
Sunday night meal prep.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.103
Dude, I thought
you boiled the eggs.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.072
That's what the timer was for.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.174
Ugh.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.178
Hey, Kimch, check it out.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.114
What, more chipmunks?
They're not going to hurt you.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.317
No, that guy.
I think that's Shannon's bike.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.455
Yeah. That's definitely it.
You up for this?

13:11.224 --> 13:12.290
Oh, yeah.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.595
Hey, bro, nice bike.
Where'd you get it?

13:18.532 --> 13:20.298
- Someone gave it to me.
- Oh, yeah?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.000
That's pretty ironic

13:22.002 --> 13:24.302
'cause, uh, it looks exactly
like my friend's bike.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.004
That's not how irony works.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.405
You better give us that bike.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.473
Look,

13:29.609 --> 13:32.544
There's obviously
been a misunderstanding.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.246
(sighs)

13:39.486 --> 13:42.220
I can't believe appa would say
something so stupid.

13:42.222 --> 13:45.190
Yeah.
He don't appreciate what I do.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.025
Gerald's exactly the same.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.594
I mentioned one thing about
how he washes his clothes,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.362
And he gets all up in my face.

13:51.364 --> 13:54.365
Yeah. And your appa only still
thinking about himself.

13:54.367 --> 13:58.069
And then he goes on
about how I'm so messy

13:58.071 --> 13:59.304
And don't do dishes every day.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.005
But I'm trying to
save the planet.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.407
He doesn't get that.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.642
You know, all men is the same.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.945
Your appa don't even
see how much I...

14:06.947 --> 14:08.313
And who doesn't
take a shower after a bath?

14:08.315 --> 14:11.983
- Janet, this is not about you!
- I know, it's about Gerald.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.985
No, this is about me.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.154
Your appa don't appreciate,
you don't listen,

14:16.156 --> 14:17.589
And Gerald is right.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.695
Okay, I get that you're in
a sensitive place right now,

14:23.697 --> 14:26.364
But it's not my fault
your generation

14:26.366 --> 14:27.665
Let men diminish
the achievements

14:27.667 --> 14:29.033
Of hard-working women.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.668
I work hard, deserve award!

14:30.670 --> 14:33.004
And you could work harder
to cleaning up!

14:33.006 --> 14:34.038
Because I'm a woman?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.673
No, because
you is messy like a pig!

14:35.675 --> 14:37.275
I am... You...

14:38.178 --> 14:39.377
(grunts)

14:39.379 --> 14:42.080
Wait, Janet, come back here!
Janet, you tea bag!

14:42.082 --> 14:44.582
Janet! Janet,
the tea bag is here! Tea bag!

14:44.584 --> 14:47.051
Frank: Is it aa or AAA?

14:47.053 --> 14:49.187
What they should do
is make a combo pack.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.491
Just buy both,
and make combo pack at home.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.559
Oh...

14:59.165 --> 15:01.099
Ooh, someone's
in the doghouse.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.166
Woof.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.903
- Can I offer some advice?
- No.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.239
Never go to bed angry.
Or hungry for that matter.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.440
Bernice and I used to stash

15:09.442 --> 15:11.042
A box of crackers
in the night stand...

15:11.044 --> 15:14.712
Frank, why I would take advice
from you when you is divorce?

15:15.982 --> 15:20.051
- (sighs) what I mean is...
- Hey, hey... No, no, no.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.587
I stuck my hand in a gopher
hole, and I got bit. Yeah.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.291
Mrs. Kim is win award
for business.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.592
Uh-huh.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.930
I tell her only reason she win
is because she is a,

15:31.932 --> 15:33.097
You know...

15:33.433 --> 15:34.499
Asian?

15:34.668 --> 15:37.268
- A woman!
- Oh, right, right.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.270
- Wow, that's a doozie.
- Yeah.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.005
I was never any good
with awards, either.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.408
They all went
to my brother, dean.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.010
Provincial track champ,
which is where he met Kathy.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.979
She had a speech impediment,

15:47.981 --> 15:49.514
But I never
held that against her.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.015
Frank, what's you point?

15:51.017 --> 15:52.283
The point is,

15:52.285 --> 15:53.551
I used to sneak
into dean's room

15:53.553 --> 15:56.554
Just to stare
at those trophies.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.489
One day I took one down,

15:58.491 --> 15:59.891
And accidentally smashed a mug

15:59.893 --> 16:01.659
That Kathy had potted
for dean.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.094
I tried to bury it
in the backyard,

16:03.096 --> 16:05.530
Which is how I dug up
cinnamon, our Irish setter.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.597
(chuckles)

16:07.033 --> 16:09.600
Dean had quite
a laugh at that.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.402
But who's laughing now?

16:11.671 --> 16:12.737
I don't know.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.505
Not dean,
he got hit by a truck.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.040
And I miss him dearly.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.278
- You see what I'm getting at?
- No.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.380
I never got to apologize
for the comic book.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.448
What comic book?

16:23.450 --> 16:24.949
Did I not mention
the comic book?

16:24.951 --> 16:25.984
(appa sighs)

16:25.986 --> 16:28.186
That's really key
to the whole thing.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.454
The point is,

16:29.456 --> 16:32.156
I don't wanna be remembered
for the things I broke,

16:32.359 --> 16:34.692
I wanna be remembered
for the things I fixed.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.131
Now, I've forgotten
why I came in here.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.133
Right, box of crackers.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.106
Did you see
the look on his face?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.507
Oh, man, so shocked!

16:49.509 --> 16:51.009
Hey, look what we found.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.111
- K-town boys representin'!
- Whoo!

16:54.080 --> 16:55.313
Where did you find it?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.415
We caught the guy red-handed.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.283
Some sketchy-looking dude
says he found it.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.485
No, no, no,
someone gave it to him.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.619
Right.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.621
- Jung was badass.
- (chuckles)

17:03.623 --> 17:06.024
- You didn't hurt him, did you?
- What? Of course not.

17:06.026 --> 17:09.427
Good. Because I did
kind of give it to him.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.496
- What?
- I felt bad for him.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.197
It seemed like
he could use it more

17:13.199 --> 17:14.699
With his nomadic lifestyle.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.368
Seriously? The rims alone
are worth 40 bucks.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.370
Okay, I'm sorry,

17:19.372 --> 17:21.139
I wanted to love it,
I really did.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.941
But it's just so hot,
and the seat kills,

17:23.943 --> 17:25.376
And you can't carry a coffee,

17:25.378 --> 17:27.111
And the hand signals
are all so confusing.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.312
Like, why is this right turn?

17:28.314 --> 17:31.049
- It's not.
- See?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.051
So, you just gave it away?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.453
Yeah.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.357
Dude, we just stole
a guy's bike.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.239
No, I'm the one that
actually paid for the bike.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.994
But I gave you money for it.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.195
Well, not the full amount,
but yeah.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.165
And she gave it to that guy.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.766
Yeah, we stole
that guy's bike.

18:01.081 --> 18:05.883
So, our neighbor
keeps calling me "ray."

18:05.885 --> 18:07.618
I think I've let it go on
for too long.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.353
I might just have to
run with it now.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.457
Look, I overreacted before,
and got defensive...

18:12.459 --> 18:13.591
I know, I got defensive, too,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.359
And then my hands
started sweating...

18:15.361 --> 18:16.494
I'm really sorry.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.562
Oh, it just happens,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.230
I think it's stress
in the hand glands.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.299
I mean, I'm sorry
about yelling.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.734
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.169
Um...

18:25.505 --> 18:28.072
- Are you moving out?
- No.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.508
- I cleaned.
- Oh.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.911
Feels a lot bigger in here
without all the stuff.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.413
That we both leave around.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.714
(chuckles lightly)

18:37.217 --> 18:38.950
Okay, I'm going to bed.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.284
- Okay.
- Good night.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.054
Oh, um, before you go to bed,
one more thing...

18:43.056 --> 18:45.623
So, when you're spreading
peanut butter around,

18:45.625 --> 18:47.658
Can you just use
all the peanut butter

18:47.660 --> 18:50.394
Instead of leaving half of it
on the knife and in the sink?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.263
Oh. (chuckles)

18:52.265 --> 18:53.598
Ha ha.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.201
Okay. Good night.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.511
(sighs) yeah, closing time.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.634
- I don't want cookie.
- You deserve cookie.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.669
You think cookie fix?

19:32.105 --> 19:35.173
I think cookie taste good.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.244
- I do lots of thing, appa.
- I know.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.647
I don't need award.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.049
I don't care
what other people think,

19:45.051 --> 19:46.751
I only care what you think.

19:47.086 --> 19:50.154
- And you think we is not same.
- No, we is not the same.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.222
(scoffs)

19:52.325 --> 19:55.593
I want chip over here,
you move chip over here.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.028
We sell more chip.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.564
I want clear Pepsi.
We order clear Pepsi.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.066
We still have clear Pepsi.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.568
You want second baby.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.137
I don't think
it's a good idea.

20:06.139 --> 20:08.406
- Then we have Janet.
- (sobs and chuckles)

20:08.408 --> 20:10.408
I still don't think
it's a good idea.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.043
(chuckles) appa.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.278
You not win award
because you is woman,

20:14.547 --> 20:17.181
You win award
because you is smart

20:17.183 --> 20:18.683
And good at business.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.354
(umma gasps)

20:24.057 --> 20:25.156
You fix.

20:25.158 --> 20:26.290
Frank help.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.659
But not for
don't touch wall upstairs.

20:29.229 --> 20:32.029
Here, everybody can see.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.498
(gasps)

20:37.036 --> 20:39.537
I like there. (chuckles)

20:41.574 --> 20:42.640
(appa sighs)

20:43.543 --> 20:44.609
Frank...

20:47.213 --> 20:50.081
- Jung: Dude, we are so sorry.
- It's okay.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.582
Kimchee:
Huge misunderstanding.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.384
Please, take the bike.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.820
It's all good. Got a new bike.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.521
That's your bike?

20:57.724 --> 20:59.190
Yeah, I forgot my key.

20:59.192 --> 21:00.992
Seriously, take this one.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.260
Mine's way nicer.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.997
It's got better shifters,
carbon forks, this thing.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.266
Here, grab the other end, and
we'll get some leverage going.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.333
Come on.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.935
Man: Hey.
That's my (bleep) bike!

21:10.937 --> 21:12.069
Okay, I'll take it.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.705
Dude, drop the cutters.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.274
Are you kidding? These are
worth, like, 20 bucks.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.476
- Let's go!
- Yeah, that doesn't look good.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.612
