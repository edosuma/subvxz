00:49.575 --> 00:51.705
A letter for you, William.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.445
Why on earth are you doing that?

00:57.533 --> 00:58.793
Well, someone's got to.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.446
Yes, indeed they do,

01:00.532 --> 01:03.229
and that someone is William
or one of the maids.

01:03.315 --> 01:07.490
You're making work for yourself, Mr Carson,
and I've no sympathy with that.

01:07.577 --> 01:09.839
I'm not asking for sympathy.

01:11.970 --> 01:14.491
- I don't think it... it should be here.
- What?

01:14.579 --> 01:17.013
Oh, for heaven's sake, man,
if something's wrong, put it right.

01:19.623 --> 01:22.363
I'm sorry, Lang, I don't mean to snap.

01:22.754 --> 01:24.059
Nothing to worry about, milord.

01:24.146 --> 01:26.277
You've been in the trenches.
I have not.

01:26.363 --> 01:28.755
I have no right to criticize.

01:28.842 --> 01:30.755
I'm not a soldier now.

01:32.408 --> 01:35.539
You've been invalided out.
That is perfectly honorable.

01:35.626 --> 01:36.888
Is it?

01:38.104 --> 01:41.627
I know people look at me
and wonder why I'm not in uniform...

01:43.279 --> 01:46.715
Then you refer them to me,
and I'll give them a piece of my mind.

01:47.759 --> 01:48.498
Hmm?

01:53.194 --> 01:54.412
A penny for your thoughts.

01:54.543 --> 01:57.586
They're worth a great deal
more than that, thank you very much.

01:59.065 --> 02:00.152
What is it?

02:00.239 --> 02:02.675
My papers. They've come.
I've been called up.

02:02.761 --> 02:05.675
- Oh, you never have.
- What does it mean?

02:05.805 --> 02:07.980
I'm to report for my
medical next Wednesday,

02:08.067 --> 02:10.328
and once I'm through that,
I go to Richmond for training.

02:10.414 --> 02:12.589
- And then you go to war?
- With any luck.

02:12.676 --> 02:14.590
I'll be beggared if it's
over before I get there.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.547
Well, if they'd listen to me,
it'd be over by tea time.

02:18.112 --> 02:22.330
Daisy, I wonder, would you
give me a picture to take with me?

02:22.939 --> 02:25.157
- I haven't got one.
- Then have one taken.

02:25.243 --> 02:26.635
On your afternoon off. Please.

02:26.722 --> 02:28.940
That's enough. Let her
get on with her work.

02:30.853 --> 02:32.897
How is Thomas coming along?

02:32.984 --> 02:35.593
I wish he could be treated
at our hospital, here.

02:35.681 --> 02:38.811
- Well, it's only for officers.
- Of course.

02:38.898 --> 02:42.986
Although, ideally, he'd love to be
transferred there to work.

02:43.072 --> 02:44.769
He won't be sent back to the front?

02:44.855 --> 02:46.552
Not with his hand the way it is.

02:47.291 --> 02:50.421
It is such a pity he
isn't under Dr Clarkson.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.074
We might have been able
to influence him a bit.

02:53.162 --> 02:54.987
I should hope so.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.988
Why, without this family
and all the money you've spent,

02:57.032 --> 02:59.511
his precious hospital
wouldn't exist at all.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.989
Perhaps I'll ask his advice.
You never know.

03:03.033 --> 03:06.990
I was sure you'd have a good idea
of what to do for the best.

03:13.383 --> 03:15.686
Fancy a tour in England, Davis?

03:15.687 --> 03:17.645
I assume you're having me on, sir.

03:17.731 --> 03:22.689
Not at all. General Sir Herbert Strutt
has asked for my transfer to be his ADC.

03:22.950 --> 03:24.515
He's touring England to boost recruitment

03:24.559 --> 03:27.255
and he's remembered that I know
Manchester and Yorkshire pretty well.

03:27.342 --> 03:30.211
It'll mean a couple of months at home
and a promotion to Captain.

03:30.299 --> 03:32.343
I can't object to that.

03:33.777 --> 03:36.691
I've only got a few days
before the medical, milady.

03:36.778 --> 03:38.648
Then go and tell your father.

03:39.517 --> 03:40.822
You don't mind, do you, Carson?

03:40.866 --> 03:43.736
We must manage with no footman at all
from next Wednesday.

03:43.823 --> 03:45.606
It'll be no different if we start now.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.693
And you've always got Lang.

03:49.042 --> 03:52.346
We wish you every good fortune.
Don't we, darling?

03:53.129 --> 03:55.782
We certainly do. Good luck, William.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.478
Thank you, milord.

04:03.435 --> 04:08.306
So, both my footmen have gone to the war,
while I cut ribbons and make speeches.

04:08.392 --> 04:12.567
And keep people's spirits up,
which is very important.

04:13.785 --> 04:16.046
By God, I envy them, though.

04:17.089 --> 04:21.524
I envy their self-respect
and I envy their ability to sleep at night.

04:28.788 --> 04:31.788
Mr Carson doesn't like the smell of
cleaning materials in the servants' hall.

04:31.875 --> 04:34.006
Not just before luncheon.

04:34.093 --> 04:37.789
Go on, Miss O'Brien.
We don't want to be unfriendly, do we?

04:37.876 --> 04:39.398
You obviously don't.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.138
Never mind. Finish it now you've started,

04:44.225 --> 04:47.661
but don't blame me
if Mr Carson takes a bite out of you.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.879
Hello, Mr Lang. Everything all right?

04:53.966 --> 04:55.662
Why do you say that?

04:56.314 --> 04:59.662
No reason. I only meant
I hope you're enjoying yourself.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.924
I know I would be, in your shoes.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.533
You never tried for the job, did you?

05:03.620 --> 05:05.272
I never got the chance.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.577
I'd no sooner heard that Mr Bates
was gone than he arrived.

05:10.056 --> 05:12.665
What brings you here, Mr Molesley?

05:12.709 --> 05:15.752
I was wondering if Anna
was anywhere around.

05:16.187 --> 05:18.927
- I could find her if you like.
- No, no.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.624
Just give her this.

05:22.710 --> 05:27.363
We were talking about it the other day
and I came across a copy in Ripon.

05:33.147 --> 05:37.582
"Elizabeth and Her German Garden"
Whatever's that about?

05:38.322 --> 05:41.061
It's about an invitation
to talk some more, that's what.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.322
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson.

05:47.237 --> 05:49.281
Lady Grantham.

05:51.237 --> 05:54.542
I'd love to help, but
it's not within my power

05:54.629 --> 05:58.325
to hook men from hither and thither
as I please.

05:58.413 --> 06:01.021
That's not at all what I was asking.

06:01.282 --> 06:04.109
Forgive me, but I thought you were saying
that you wanted Corporal Barrow

06:04.195 --> 06:07.284
to come and work here
when he's fully recovered.

06:07.370 --> 06:11.850
I think it a credit to him that
he wants to continue to serve in this way,

06:11.893 --> 06:13.154
after he's been wounded.

06:13.241 --> 06:18.068
Well, that's as maybe, but it's not for me
to decide what happens next.

06:29.244 --> 06:31.288
Mr Carson, are you quite well?

06:31.331 --> 06:32.679
Oh, leave me alone.

06:38.768 --> 06:40.463
But after 24 hours...

06:40.507 --> 06:42.116
Oh, are you all right, Carson?

06:42.203 --> 06:46.465
Of course. That is, perfectly all right,
Your Ladyship, thank you.

06:47.204 --> 06:48.291
No.

06:49.030 --> 06:52.291
Cousin Isobel says Matthew's
coming home in a fortnight.

06:52.422 --> 06:54.683
He's touring England with some General.

06:54.727 --> 06:57.727
Well, we'll have a dinner
when he's here.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.815
I was going to ask Richard Carlisle
about then.

07:00.858 --> 07:02.858
For Saturday to Monday.

07:02.902 --> 07:04.511
You be careful, Mary.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.729
Sir Richard mustn't think you're after him.

07:06.816 --> 07:09.990
- Isn't that the truth?
- The truth is neither here nor there.

07:10.034 --> 07:13.687
It's the look of the thing that matters.
Ask Rosamund.

07:13.773 --> 07:15.165
It'll take the edge off it.

07:15.252 --> 07:17.774
That'd be nice. Like before the war.

07:19.253 --> 07:22.949
How can we manage a great pre-war
house party without a single footman?

07:23.036 --> 07:25.820
My dear, Rosamund is not a house party.

07:26.428 --> 07:27.906
She's blood.

07:29.254 --> 07:31.907
I saw Mrs Drake when I
went into the village.

07:31.995 --> 07:35.256
The wife of John Drake,
who has Longfield Farm.

07:35.691 --> 07:37.604
Oh? What did she have to say?

07:37.691 --> 07:41.822
Apparently, their final able-bodied
farmhand has been called up.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.649
They need a man to drive the tractor.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.562
Well, hasn't Drake recovered from his illness?
I thought he was better.

07:46.649 --> 07:49.171
No, he is. He's much, much better.

07:49.432 --> 07:51.345
But he doesn't drive.

07:52.215 --> 07:54.260
So, I told her I could do it.

07:54.346 --> 07:56.999
- What?
- I said I could drive the tractor.

07:57.347 --> 08:01.130
Edith, you are a lady,
not Toad of Toad Hall.

08:01.695 --> 08:03.478
Well, I'm doing it.

08:17.959 --> 08:22.568
Don't look so bewildered.
It's simple. I will drive the tractor.

08:23.525 --> 08:25.091
But can you do that?

08:25.178 --> 08:29.657
Absolutely. Can you hitch up the plough
or whatever it is I'm dragging?

08:30.265 --> 08:31.353
Of course.

08:32.005 --> 08:33.397
When would you like me to start?

08:35.745 --> 08:37.614
Well, I'd better get you
something to wear, then.

08:39.222 --> 08:40.876
Oh, I like a bit of life in the house,

08:40.964 --> 08:44.356
but I just hope Mr Carson
doesn't spontaneously combust.

08:44.442 --> 08:46.964
I had a letter yesterday.

08:47.616 --> 08:49.531
- Yes?
- It's my sister's boy.

08:49.617 --> 08:52.009
He's with the Lancashire Fusiliers.

08:52.052 --> 08:54.139
Only he's gone missing.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.357
"Missing, presumed dead," they call it.

08:58.054 --> 09:01.532
Oh, no. How did it happen?

09:01.619 --> 09:03.139
That's just it. They can't find out.

09:03.140 --> 09:04.576
How it happened, why it happened,

09:04.663 --> 09:08.969
whether we can be sure it did happen
or he isn't lying prisoner somewhere.

09:10.273 --> 09:11.882
Why not ask His Lordship?

09:11.969 --> 09:15.056
He'll have friends in the War Office,
they can dig something up.

09:15.144 --> 09:17.578
Oh, I don't like to bother him.

09:17.622 --> 09:20.884
Why not? He's got broad shoulders.

09:21.535 --> 09:22.667
Mmm.

09:24.276 --> 09:26.580
That's ever so fine, Mr Lang.

09:26.928 --> 09:29.755
However can you make those big hands
do such delicate work?

09:30.711 --> 09:34.321
I expect there's no end
to the things they could manage.

09:34.494 --> 09:36.842
Giving you a slap for a start.

09:41.408 --> 09:43.540
That is good. Very good.

09:44.670 --> 09:46.976
I like to see a proper skill.

09:47.149 --> 09:51.193
These days, blokes think they can be a valet
if they can smile and tie a shoelace.

09:51.237 --> 09:54.890
But there's an art to it,
and I can tell you've got it.

09:55.673 --> 09:57.499
My mother taught me.

09:58.586 --> 10:01.065
She was a lady's maid, like you.

10:01.804 --> 10:03.804
Well, she knew what she was about.

10:03.891 --> 10:07.588
Oh, Mr Lang, as you know,
Sir Richard Carlisle arrives later

10:07.674 --> 10:10.066
and the Crawleys
are coming for dinner tonight.

10:10.153 --> 10:13.937
I really can't have maids in the
dining room for such a party,

10:14.023 --> 10:17.503
so I'd be grateful if you'd help me
and play the footman.

10:17.589 --> 10:19.764
Me? Wait at table?

10:19.938 --> 10:22.547
Well, it's not ideal,
but I'm afraid I've no choice.

10:22.634 --> 10:26.852
The footmen's liveries are in a cupboard
just past Mrs Hughes' sitting room.

10:26.938 --> 10:29.288
You should find one to fit you.

10:33.287 --> 10:36.158
I'm not sure what I can do,
but I'm happy to try.

10:36.245 --> 10:38.941
- What's his name?
- Archie.

10:39.028 --> 10:42.072
That is Archibald Philpotts.

10:42.159 --> 10:46.334
He was in the Lancashire Fusiliers.
They think he was in Northern France.

10:47.073 --> 10:51.552
You realize the most likely outcome
is that he has indeed been killed?

10:51.726 --> 10:56.205
I understand, milord.
But we'd rather know the worst than wonder.

10:56.684 --> 10:57.770
Mmm.

11:00.380 --> 11:03.424
- Oh.
- Oh, hello, Mr Molesley.

11:03.510 --> 11:04.859
What are you doing here?

11:04.946 --> 11:07.860
I asked inside, and they said
you were over at the laundry.

11:07.946 --> 11:10.599
Lady Mary wants to wear this tonight.
I wasn't sure it was done.

11:10.686 --> 11:14.078
I was really wondering
if you'd had a chance to read that book.

11:14.165 --> 11:17.296
- You only gave it to me yesterday.
- Of course, of course.

11:18.557 --> 11:22.471
But when you have read it,
I hope we can exchange our views.

11:22.906 --> 11:24.341
That'd be nice.

11:24.427 --> 11:26.515
Perhaps we might bring
some of the others in.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.341
We could have a sort of reading club.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.994
We could do that.

11:34.082 --> 11:37.517
Or we could talk about it together,
just we two.

11:41.865 --> 11:45.475
Heavens. It's later than I thought.
I must get on.

11:52.911 --> 11:54.955
I'm off to change, but I wanted you to know

11:55.042 --> 11:57.825
I sent a note down to Clarkson
which should do the trick.

11:57.912 --> 12:00.695
- What did you say?
- Only that I gathered you'd asked a favor

12:00.782 --> 12:03.261
and given that the estate
shoulders the hospital costs,

12:03.347 --> 12:06.130
it did seem a little unfair
if we weren't allowed a few perks.

12:06.609 --> 12:09.175
Quite right. Thank you, darling.

12:13.958 --> 12:15.741
Well done, milady.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.220
Ready?

12:22.569 --> 12:23.612
Ready!

12:25.177 --> 12:26.439
Come on, damn you!

12:42.528 --> 12:44.659
Yes!

12:50.356 --> 12:53.617
To the victor, the spoils.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.358
Did you plant that tree?

12:57.444 --> 13:00.271
Steady on. It must be 40 years old.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.749
It's not a flattering light.

13:03.358 --> 13:05.228
My father planted it.

13:05.576 --> 13:09.447
But you have to be tough with fruit trees
and not let them outstay their welcome.

13:09.533 --> 13:12.360
Farming needs a kind of toughness,
doesn't it?

13:12.447 --> 13:15.491
There's room for sentiment,
but not sentimentality.

13:15.578 --> 13:18.709
Beautifully put, if I may say so, milady.

13:18.796 --> 13:21.014
- You should be a writer.
- Thank you.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.058
How are you getting on?
Very well, I think.

13:24.145 --> 13:26.058
- And it's not too hard for you?
- Not at all.

13:26.145 --> 13:28.493
She's stronger than she looks.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.972
I've brought you something to eat, milady,

13:32.059 --> 13:33.930
though I'm afraid it's
not what you're used to.

13:34.799 --> 13:35.886
Hey, it's not for you.

13:45.801 --> 13:47.323
So, it is you.

13:49.976 --> 13:53.194
Ethel thought I must have
a soldier fancy man.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.411
- Is she the new maid?
- Yes.

13:56.193 --> 13:58.020
She's a soppy sort.

13:59.412 --> 14:03.674
So, tell me, was Dr Clarkson thrilled
to have your services?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.500
Oh, it's Major Clarkson now, but yes.

14:07.196 --> 14:09.370
I don't know how you did it.

14:11.805 --> 14:14.023
What about your blighty?

14:20.199 --> 14:22.285
- My God.
- It's not so bad.

14:23.764 --> 14:26.895
And it lived up to its
name, and got me home.

14:30.766 --> 14:32.765
You'd better come inside.

14:32.853 --> 14:35.288
Where's William?
Training for the army.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.462
I thought he might have
died for love of you.

14:37.549 --> 14:39.507
Don't be nasty. Not as soon as you're back.

14:39.593 --> 14:41.898
Imagine Carson without a footman.

14:41.985 --> 14:43.681
Like a ringmaster without a pony...

14:43.768 --> 14:46.289
We'll have none of your cheek,
thank you, Thomas.

14:46.377 --> 14:49.769
I'm very sorry, Mrs Hughes,
but I'm not a servant any more.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.291
I take my orders from Major Clarkson.

14:53.770 --> 14:57.422
Who's this?
Ethel. The new maid. I told you.

14:58.336 --> 15:01.945
When I saw you out there, I didn't realize
I was dealing with an ex-footman.

15:02.032 --> 15:04.162
I'm the one that got away.

15:04.728 --> 15:06.511
Gives hope to us all.

15:06.554 --> 15:10.337
Ethel, get ready to help with the luggage.
They're nearly back with Sir Richard.

15:10.555 --> 15:14.078
- We've got a visitor, Mr Carson.
- I've seen him.

15:18.165 --> 15:19.774
Where's Mr Bates?

15:19.862 --> 15:22.514
Gone. Replaced by Mr Lang.

15:23.775 --> 15:25.514
So not all the changes were bad.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.214
Hello.

15:48.432 --> 15:50.127
We're so pleased to have you here,
Sir Richard.

15:50.215 --> 15:51.345
- Lady Grantham.
- Welcome.

15:51.389 --> 15:52.475
Thank you.

15:52.563 --> 15:54.607
I hope the train wasn't too tiring.
Hello, Mary.

15:54.693 --> 15:56.564
Not a bit, no. I got a lot done.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.738
- Hello, Aunt Rosamund.
- Brother dear.

15:58.868 --> 16:00.303
How are you?

16:00.956 --> 16:03.216
Lovely to see you, Rosamund.

16:08.565 --> 16:10.262
He's nice, isn't he?

16:10.392 --> 16:13.436
To be honest, he spent the entire journey
reading his own papers.

16:13.566 --> 16:18.002
But I'm sure I'll love him dearly
if he'll ever look up from the page...

16:22.742 --> 16:25.308
Branson, when you've finished unloading,

16:25.395 --> 16:28.830
run down to the hospital and remind Lady
Sybil that we expect her here for dinner.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.830
And tell her I mean it.

16:30.917 --> 16:34.787
Really, they're working her
like a packhorse in a mine.

16:34.918 --> 16:36.310
I think she enjoys it, though.

16:39.528 --> 16:41.745
Please tell her to come home
in time to change.

16:45.094 --> 16:48.225
I can't possibly come!
Really, Mama is incorrigible!

16:49.051 --> 16:50.921
It's not poor Branson's fault.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.052
But what is the point of Mama's soir?s?
What are they for?

16:54.139 --> 16:58.444
Well, I'm going up for dinner tonight
and I'm glad. Is that wrong?

16:59.488 --> 17:03.619
Thomas, you can cover
for Nurse Crawley, can't you?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.618
I can.

17:09.098 --> 17:12.446
So you're back then, safe and sound.

17:12.577 --> 17:15.404
That's not how I'd put it,
with my hand the way it is.

17:15.491 --> 17:20.709
But, yes, Major Clarkson's found me a place.
And I'm grateful.

17:20.796 --> 17:23.144
Can you give Lieutenant
Courtenay his pills?

17:23.797 --> 17:26.665
Of course I can, I'd be glad to.

17:33.407 --> 17:35.147
Is everything under control?

17:35.277 --> 17:37.625
Mr Lang seems a bit nervous.

17:38.147 --> 17:41.148
Stage fright. But what about you?

17:42.148 --> 17:44.714
Oh, I'm a trooper.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.714
And we can't complain, can we?

17:47.801 --> 17:50.758
Not when you think
what's going on in France.

17:50.801 --> 17:54.976
Still, a broken heart can be
as painful as a broken limb.

17:56.671 --> 17:59.933
Don't feel sorry for me, Mrs Hughes.
I'm not.

18:01.107 --> 18:04.847
I know what real love is
and there aren't many who can say that.

18:04.934 --> 18:07.021
I'm one of the lucky ones.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.761
If you say so.

18:15.153 --> 18:18.676
So, the fashion for cocktails before dinner
hasn't reached Yorkshire?

18:18.806 --> 18:23.198
I could get Carson to make you one,
but I won't guarantee the result.

18:23.502 --> 18:27.286
Mrs Crawley, Captain
Crawley and Miss Swire.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.156
Ah! Isobel.

18:29.982 --> 18:33.287
Well, now, still in one piece. Thank God.

18:33.374 --> 18:35.114
- Touch wood.
- I never stop touching it.

18:35.201 --> 18:39.114
Do you know Sir Richard Carlisle?
My cousin, Captain Crawley.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.202
How do you do?
And his fianc?, Miss Swire.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.551
I know Miss Swire.
Her uncle and I are old friends.

18:45.681 --> 18:47.725
Well, old acquaintances, anyway.

18:50.377 --> 18:51.986
What do you think Mary sees in him?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.291
Besides the money, you mean?

18:54.378 --> 18:58.814
- It must be more than that.
- For you. Not necessarily for her.

19:00.379 --> 19:02.075
What's General Strutt like?

19:02.206 --> 19:04.206
You know, rather important.

19:04.466 --> 19:07.076
And brave. He got the DSO in South Africa.

19:07.207 --> 19:11.642
Is there any chance it might be permanent,
that we can count you out of danger?

19:11.729 --> 19:15.730
- It would be such a relief.
- I wouldn't want that, I'm afraid.

19:16.164 --> 19:18.339
He's promised to get me back to France
when he's done with me.

19:18.426 --> 19:21.339
How's your new appointment
with the North Ridings working out?

19:21.426 --> 19:22.730
Oh, that.

19:24.253 --> 19:27.601
It seems I won't be going
to the front, after all.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.602
I made a mistake.

19:30.515 --> 19:32.602
They only wanted a mascot.

19:34.603 --> 19:37.907
Mary tells me you're in newspapers?

19:38.081 --> 19:39.429
Well, I own a few.

19:39.560 --> 19:45.387
Oh? That must be quite a responsibility
at a time like this, you know, in a war.

19:46.039 --> 19:48.692
When it's so important
to keep people's spirits up.

19:48.779 --> 19:51.606
Lady Grantham,
my responsibility is to my investors.

19:51.737 --> 19:53.128
I need to keep my readership up.

19:53.215 --> 19:56.650
I leave the public's spirits
to government propaganda.

19:56.737 --> 20:01.303
So now you've met Granny.
I warn you, she has very strong opinions.

20:01.346 --> 20:05.173
You need have no fear
where that's concerned, my dear.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.652
We are more than evenly matched.

20:09.652 --> 20:11.566
- Where are the spoons for this?
- Just here.

20:12.566 --> 20:15.218
- Oh, my God, I've forgotten the sauce!
- Mr Lang's bringing the sauce.

20:15.306 --> 20:18.045
- And the melba toast.
- Right. Right. Good.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.437
- Now, Mr Lang, are you ready?
- I think so.

20:20.524 --> 20:24.959
- It's always the left. And not ladies first.
- No. Just follow Mr Carson.

20:25.047 --> 20:29.351
Start with old Lady Grantham,
then His Lordship. Then just go on round.

20:29.439 --> 20:31.004
You must have done this before.

20:31.092 --> 20:33.005
Not since the war started.

20:33.048 --> 20:34.831
I don't think I ever knew that.

20:34.918 --> 20:37.788
Why isn't it just ladies first?
Wouldn't it be more polite?

20:37.918 --> 20:41.615
That's the way it's done on the Continent.
And we don't like foreign ways here.

20:45.006 --> 20:49.486
I gather your footman, Thomas,
has returned to the village.

20:49.572 --> 20:51.704
Crikey. Where did you see him?

20:51.790 --> 20:54.791
At the hospital. Seems he's working there.

20:55.356 --> 20:56.444
I wonder how he wangled that.

20:56.747 --> 20:59.183
No, no, no. Get back! Behind me!

21:04.879 --> 21:06.880
What do you make of our plutocrat?

21:06.967 --> 21:08.141
He's an opportunity.

21:08.229 --> 21:11.489
Mary needs a position
and preferably a powerful one.

21:11.924 --> 21:13.664
He can provide it.

21:13.751 --> 21:17.752
You don't think she'd be happier
with a more traditional setup?

21:17.838 --> 21:19.926
Will she have the option?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.231
Thank you, but I already have some.

21:22.318 --> 21:24.361
No, no, give that to me.

21:27.449 --> 21:31.710
I do apologise, milady.
Mr Lang, get a cloth...

21:33.842 --> 21:36.016
Carson. Carson! What's the matter?

21:37.146 --> 21:40.495
Now, Carson, it's all right.
Everything will be fine.

21:40.582 --> 21:43.409
Edith, go with Branson
and fetch Major Clarkson.

21:43.452 --> 21:45.234
I'll telephone and explain what's happened.

21:45.322 --> 21:46.801
But what about my dress?

21:46.887 --> 21:49.149
Edith, we'll get you a coat! Come!

21:49.235 --> 21:51.714
Sybil will know what to do
until the doctor comes.

21:52.671 --> 21:55.150
You'll find there's never
a dull moment in this house.

21:55.367 --> 21:59.064
Lady Sybil and I will take him upstairs
if Mrs Hughes will show us the way, please.

21:59.150 --> 22:01.759
- I can help.
- No, let me. I Know what I'm doing.

22:01.803 --> 22:04.325
I'm sure that's not necessary, milady.

22:04.412 --> 22:06.630
It's not "milady" now, Carson.
Mr Lang.

22:06.717 --> 22:09.196
- It's Nurse Crawley.
- Mr Lang!

22:11.588 --> 22:14.806
Anna and Ethel, I must
trust the dinner to you.

22:14.892 --> 22:17.240
Well, I'd say the first course
is a thing of the past.

22:17.328 --> 22:22.024
Then clear and lay the hot plates. Daisy,
you fetch the beef and the rest of it.

22:22.111 --> 22:23.807
And, Anna, you'll have to serve the wine.

22:26.503 --> 22:28.982
Mr Lang, you can clear up the mess.

22:29.069 --> 22:30.722
- I'll do that.
- There's no need.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.505
- I don't mind.
- I thank you.

22:34.244 --> 22:36.853
Mr Lang, you'd better go downstairs.

22:38.722 --> 22:41.549
Well, Clarkson's seen him.

22:41.637 --> 22:44.637
It's definitely not a heart attack,
but he does need rest.

22:44.724 --> 22:47.072
He's working much too hard.

22:47.768 --> 22:51.246
For a start, he's just got to let
the maids serve in the dining room.

22:51.334 --> 22:53.769
Quite right. There is a war.

22:54.812 --> 22:57.248
Even Carson has to make sacrifices.

22:57.509 --> 23:01.727
Poor Lang! He looked like a rabbit
in front of a snake.

23:01.988 --> 23:05.771
I don't understand it.
He seemed so solid when I met him,

23:05.858 --> 23:08.380
even taciturn,
but now he's a bundle of nerves.

23:08.728 --> 23:10.816
I heard what you said to Matthew
about the regiment.

23:12.729 --> 23:15.903
Everyone else knows what a fool
I made of myself. Why shouldn't he?

23:16.338 --> 23:18.991
I don't think you're a fool.
Isn't that enough?

23:19.078 --> 23:22.601
No. Maybe it should be, but it isn't.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.820
Are you all right, Mr Lang?

23:40.299 --> 23:42.125
You're not, are you?

23:47.126 --> 23:49.909
I've seen shell shock before, you know.

23:51.606 --> 23:53.649
I had a brother with it.

23:55.214 --> 23:57.215
My favorite brother, as it happens.

23:58.259 --> 24:00.563
And I was his favorite, too.

24:02.912 --> 24:05.173
They sent him back and he's dead now.

24:08.435 --> 24:10.479
They won't send me back.

24:13.087 --> 24:15.174
I'm a goner as far as they're concerned.

24:15.175 --> 24:18.306
- You shouldn't be working yet.
- I must work.

24:20.089 --> 24:22.480
I don't know what I'd do else.

24:24.133 --> 24:26.611
I have to work.

24:26.655 --> 24:29.308
Mr Lang, I thought you'd gone up.

24:29.699 --> 24:31.830
He wanted to hang up the livery
before it got creased.

24:33.309 --> 24:36.831
Well, we can discuss the
dinner another time.

24:38.049 --> 24:39.223
I'll say good night.

24:39.310 --> 24:42.267
Good night, Mrs Hughes.
Good night.

25:01.140 --> 25:02.967
May I come in?

25:03.097 --> 25:06.097
That's very kind of you, milady,
but do you think you should?

25:06.401 --> 25:09.141
Let's hope my reputation will survive it.

25:09.272 --> 25:11.315
And rest easy. Please.

25:14.924 --> 25:16.577
I gather it isn't too serious.

25:16.621 --> 25:19.230
Oh, I've been very stupid, milady

25:19.317 --> 25:21.535
I let myself get flustered.

25:21.622 --> 25:24.796
I regard that as highly unprofessional.
It won't happen again.

25:24.839 --> 25:26.840
You mustn't be too hard on yourself.

25:27.013 --> 25:29.798
I was particularly sorry
to spoil things for Sir Richard,

25:29.884 --> 25:31.841
knowing he was a guest of yours.

25:31.928 --> 25:35.059
Don't be. I think he found
it all quite exciting.

25:35.146 --> 25:36.277
Oh.

25:37.842 --> 25:39.799
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

25:40.104 --> 25:42.973
I don't know. Maybe.

25:44.974 --> 25:46.191
And Captain Crawley?

25:47.627 --> 25:51.322
Is he happy with the changes, so to speak?

25:57.976 --> 26:01.542
May I give you one piece of advice, milady?

26:02.977 --> 26:05.368
Tell him what's in your heart.

26:05.499 --> 26:07.804
If you still love him, let him know.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.718
Then even if he's killed,
and he may be, you won't be sorry.

26:13.761 --> 26:16.893
If you don't tell him,
you could regret it all your life long.

26:18.850 --> 26:20.197
And what about Miss Swire?

26:21.502 --> 26:22.937
Miss Swire!

26:22.981 --> 26:27.025
As if any man in his right mind
could prefer Miss Swire to you.

26:32.025 --> 26:35.591
Oh, I'm so sorry, milady.
I didn't know you were in here.

26:35.678 --> 26:39.853
I was just going.
Carson's been boosting my confidence.

26:48.029 --> 26:51.116
That's something I'd never
have thought she was short of.

26:54.725 --> 26:59.074
What about you, sir?
What did you do before the war started?

27:01.030 --> 27:02.771
I was up at Oxford.

27:04.553 --> 27:07.032
But I only ever planned to farm.

27:07.728 --> 27:12.076
Farm and shoot and hunt and fish,

27:14.990 --> 27:16.904
and everything I'll never do again.

27:18.034 --> 27:21.339
You don't know that, sir. We've had
cases of gas blindness wearing off.

27:21.426 --> 27:25.122
Rare cases. And much sooner than this.

27:25.209 --> 27:27.210
It doesn't help me to be lied to, you know.

27:28.862 --> 27:33.559
I'm finished,
and I'd rather face it than dodge it.

27:36.254 --> 27:37.951
I'd better go.

27:41.212 --> 27:44.560
Where's Rosamund?
She's with your mama.

27:44.604 --> 27:47.909
Trying to talk her into
the idea of Sir Richard.

27:48.387 --> 27:50.909
You don't sound very enthusiastic.

27:51.561 --> 27:52.823
Are you?

27:53.910 --> 27:57.171
- Can we stop for a minute?
- Don't tell me you're tired.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.955
I'm not tired. I'm hot
. This tweed is too thick.

28:01.432 --> 28:03.608
It looks more suited to
shooting than walking.

28:04.608 --> 28:07.739
I had it made for the weekend.
I didn't know there was a difference.

28:07.825 --> 28:09.390
It doesn't matter.

28:09.478 --> 28:11.608
That's like the rich who say
that money doesn't matter.

28:11.740 --> 28:14.305
It matters enough when you haven't got it.

28:14.435 --> 28:18.654
I know you don't care about our silly rules.
You're always very clear on that score.

28:20.132 --> 28:23.306
You make me sound rude
and I hope I'm not that.

28:24.002 --> 28:27.307
I mean to learn how to do things properly
and I'm sure you could help me a lot.

28:29.133 --> 28:33.004
But I'm not ashamed of being
what they call a self-made man.

28:33.134 --> 28:34.787
I'm proud of it.

28:35.005 --> 28:38.309
Is the point of all this
to test me in some way?

28:38.657 --> 28:39.918
Maybe.

28:40.919 --> 28:44.179
Are you shocked
by my bold and modern values?

28:44.962 --> 28:47.485
Oh, Sir Richard, you flatter yourself.

28:47.615 --> 28:49.963
It takes a good deal more than that
to shock me.

29:02.357 --> 29:05.270
But, Mama, who do you imagine
is out there with more to offer?

29:05.793 --> 29:08.271
- I am not a romantic.
- I should hope not.

29:08.358 --> 29:10.924
But even I will concede
that the heart does not exist

29:11.010 --> 29:13.316
solely for the purpose of pumping blood.

29:13.446 --> 29:16.229
That is charming, especially from you.

29:17.359 --> 29:20.404
But Mary seems to have
blotted her copybook in some way.

29:25.840 --> 29:30.492
So she needs a suitable marriage
that will mend her fences.

29:30.666 --> 29:33.841
Well, how do we know Carlisle is suitable?
I mean, who is he?

29:33.971 --> 29:35.624
Who'd ever heard of him before the war?

29:35.711 --> 29:40.190
Sir Richard is powerful and rich,
and well on the way to a peerage.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.234
Of course he may not be
all that one would wish,

29:43.365 --> 29:46.364
but Mary can soon smooth off
the rough edges.

29:46.582 --> 29:49.756
- Well, you should know.
- What do you mean by that?

29:49.887 --> 29:51.714
Marmaduke was a gentleman.

29:51.888 --> 29:55.236
Marmaduke was the grandson
of a manufacturer.

29:55.366 --> 29:57.019
His mother was the daughter of a baronet.

29:57.105 --> 30:01.368
Maybe. But they were no great threat
to the Plantagenets.

30:03.542 --> 30:07.151
The point is,
I made up for any social deficiencies

30:07.238 --> 30:08.891
and he provided me with a position.

30:09.238 --> 30:11.456
It was a good exchange and it worked well.

30:11.544 --> 30:15.196
How can Matthew have chosen
that little blond piece?

30:15.283 --> 30:18.414
You speak so eloquently
of the human heart, Mama.

30:18.545 --> 30:21.371
You must be aware of its vagaries.

30:22.893 --> 30:25.459
"Things cannot be as they were
and whatever you might think,

30:25.589 --> 30:28.807
- "Jack has your best interests at heart."
- Stop.

30:30.199 --> 30:31.590
Who's Jack?

30:33.895 --> 30:35.635
My younger brother.

30:37.592 --> 30:39.592
He means to replace me.

30:41.766 --> 30:43.636
It's what he's always wanted.

30:47.159 --> 30:48.637
Yeah, well...

30:50.725 --> 30:54.464
I'm sorry. I mustn't bore you.

30:56.421 --> 31:00.813
Don't let them walk all over you.
You've got to fight your corner.

31:03.770 --> 31:06.074
- What with?
- Your brain.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.293
You're not a victim.
Don't let them make you into one.

31:11.641 --> 31:16.468
You know, when you talk like that,
I almost believe you.

31:16.989 --> 31:18.773
Well, you should believe me.

31:20.904 --> 31:25.817
All my life, they've pushed me around

31:26.818 --> 31:28.253
just 'cause I'm different.

31:31.645 --> 31:33.123
How? Why are you different?

31:36.255 --> 31:37.646
Never mind.

31:40.342 --> 31:41.646
Look...

31:42.342 --> 31:45.821
Look, I... I don't know
if you're gonna see again or not.

31:47.952 --> 31:50.648
But I do know you have to fight back.

32:02.303 --> 32:05.172
How dare you threaten me?
How dare I?

32:05.303 --> 32:07.434
Oh, I assure you,
I dare a great deal more than that.

32:07.520 --> 32:10.347
But you can't! You wouldn't!
I didn't say I would.

32:10.477 --> 32:13.348
I was merely reminding you
it was in my power.

32:18.175 --> 32:20.783
- Lady Painswick.
- Lady Rosamund.

32:20.871 --> 32:23.654
I'm sorry. I'll get these things sorted out
before too long.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.350
It's not important.

32:27.829 --> 32:30.568
Miss Swire and I
were just talking about old times.

32:31.047 --> 32:32.351
Happy old times, I hope.

32:33.830 --> 32:36.569
Will you forgive me?
I want to write some letters before dinner.

32:44.180 --> 32:46.136
Let's have a rest. We've earned it.

32:50.397 --> 32:51.746
I should have gone in for a glass.

32:51.876 --> 32:54.398
I don't suppose you can drink out
of a bottle, can you, milady?

32:54.529 --> 32:56.747
- I wish you'd call me Edith.
- Oh.

32:56.878 --> 32:59.834
And of course I can drink from the bottle.

33:04.009 --> 33:06.922
Would you like me to teach you to drive?

33:08.010 --> 33:11.706
Not much. 'Cause then
you wouldn't come here no more.

33:13.097 --> 33:15.185
Although that wouldn't matter to you.

33:15.272 --> 33:17.142
Why do you say that?

33:18.795 --> 33:24.274
You're pretty and clever and fine.
You're from a different world.

33:25.926 --> 33:29.231
- Is something wrong?
- No. We're just having a break.

33:30.014 --> 33:32.579
'Cause you want to get into town
to fetch the bone meal

33:32.710 --> 33:35.754
and be back in time
to feed the cows before it's dark.

33:35.841 --> 33:37.580
They could always have a midnight feast.

33:43.712 --> 33:45.930
That's it. That's right, sir.

33:46.017 --> 33:48.713
If you move the stick fast enough,
you don't have to slacken your pace.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.887
And check the width of the space
as well as any possible obstruction.

33:52.931 --> 33:57.584
Lieutenant Courtenay, well done.
You're making good progress.

33:58.019 --> 34:00.237
Thanks to my saviors, sir.

34:00.802 --> 34:02.628
So you'll be pleased to hear
that we're all agreed

34:02.758 --> 34:05.108
that it's time for you
to continue your treatment elsewhere.

34:06.455 --> 34:08.411
- What?
- At Farley Hall.

34:08.976 --> 34:10.716
You're not ill any more.

34:10.804 --> 34:12.978
All you need is time to adjust
to your condition,

34:13.108 --> 34:15.891
and the staff at Farley can help with that.

34:15.978 --> 34:19.152
But, sir, these two are helping me here.

34:20.284 --> 34:24.414
Oh, Nurse Crawley and Corporal Barrow
are not trained in specialist care.

34:24.502 --> 34:26.632
Please, don't send me away.

34:28.155 --> 34:29.329
Not yet.

34:31.416 --> 34:33.155
Sir, surely we...

34:36.069 --> 34:40.766
Lieutenant, you must know that
every one of our beds is needed

34:40.809 --> 34:44.331
for the injured and dying from Arras. Hmm?

34:48.246 --> 34:50.853
Corporal, I'll see you in my office.

34:53.159 --> 34:56.333
Sir, I only meant to say that
Lieutenant Courtenay is depressed...

34:56.420 --> 35:00.335
I will not leave wounded soldiers
freezing or sweating under a canvas

35:00.465 --> 35:02.769
because one junior officer is depressed!

35:02.857 --> 35:04.857
Yes!

35:04.987 --> 35:06.814
I thought you may want
to know what I think.

35:06.944 --> 35:08.684
Why should I?

35:08.814 --> 35:13.294
Nurse Crawley, I may not be
your social superior in a Mayfair ballroom,

35:13.380 --> 35:16.685
but, in this hospital,
I have the deciding voice.

35:19.599 --> 35:23.556
Please help him prepare his belongings.
He leaves first thing in the morning.

35:24.860 --> 35:27.643
Anna and Ethel will wait at the table
and I will supervise.

35:27.731 --> 35:29.861
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

35:29.991 --> 35:33.558
Except that it's how a chartered accountant
would have his dinner served.

35:33.645 --> 35:35.819
I can think of worse insults.

35:35.906 --> 35:40.559
If you say so. But I don't want Lang
allowed anywhere near it.

35:42.038 --> 35:45.125
Oh, Mr Bates,
where are you when we need you?

35:46.125 --> 35:48.996
Can you bring me the wine ledgers
and I'll make a selection?

35:49.082 --> 35:51.649
His Lordship's already done that.

35:51.735 --> 35:53.257
Just try to rest.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.997
To rest or to feel redundant?

35:56.083 --> 35:59.737
Both, if it'll slow you down
for a minute and a half.

36:00.041 --> 36:02.563
The world does not turn
on the style of a dinner.

36:03.259 --> 36:05.042
My world does.

36:07.825 --> 36:09.608
How does he know Miss Swire?

36:10.043 --> 36:11.913
- What?
- Miss Swire.

36:12.434 --> 36:14.913
They were in the garden
when I came back from Mama's.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.913
I suppose they met in London.

36:20.262 --> 36:21.914
Would you like me to come back later,
milady?

36:22.002 --> 36:24.437
No, come in. I was just leaving.

36:32.177 --> 36:35.265
- How's Carson getting on?
- Oh, much better, milady.

36:35.352 --> 36:38.526
Mrs Hughes is having a job
keeping him in bed.

36:40.918 --> 36:43.179
He gave me some advice last night.

36:43.658 --> 36:45.005
Oh, yes?

36:45.832 --> 36:47.615
Was it good advice?

36:48.180 --> 36:50.050
It was about honesty.

36:50.572 --> 36:53.529
He thinks I should say what I really feel.

36:54.094 --> 36:55.877
Sounds a bit wild for Mr Carson.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.617
But do you think he's right?

37:01.965 --> 37:05.096
Well, they do say honesty's
the best policy.

37:06.140 --> 37:10.924
And I think you regret being honest
less often than you regret telling lies.

37:41.450 --> 37:44.451
He must have smuggled a razor into his bed.

37:44.495 --> 37:47.278
There was nothing to be done.

37:47.364 --> 37:51.017
- It's because we ordered him to go.
- We don't know that.

37:51.626 --> 37:54.236
This is a tragedy. I don't deny it.

37:54.322 --> 37:57.496
But I cannot see
what other course was open to me.

37:57.584 --> 37:59.802
We have no room for men to convalesce here

37:59.845 --> 38:03.280
and Farley is the nearest house
I can send them to.

38:04.542 --> 38:07.499
There is a solution
and it's staring us in the face.

38:08.629 --> 38:10.673
- Downton Abbey.
- Would they ever allow it?

38:14.369 --> 38:17.022
- Or even consider it?
- I think they would.

38:19.284 --> 38:22.109
After this, I think they can be made to.

38:30.372 --> 38:33.982
- But, Sir Richard, you don't have to...
- Richard, please.

38:36.983 --> 38:39.417
You see, I want you to marry me.

38:40.591 --> 38:41.852
Why?

38:42.549 --> 38:45.201
Because I think very highly of you.

38:45.288 --> 38:47.854
Very highly? Goodness.

38:47.940 --> 38:51.550
I mean it. I think we'd do well together.

38:52.028 --> 38:54.115
We could be a good team.

38:54.246 --> 38:56.289
Now, that sounds better.

38:57.725 --> 39:03.726
But I can't help thinking that
tradition demands a little mention of love.

39:04.509 --> 39:09.510
Oh, I can talk about love and moon and June
and all the rest of it, if you wish.

39:09.596 --> 39:11.205
But we're more than that.

39:11.684 --> 39:14.076
We're strong and sharp

39:14.162 --> 39:18.424
and we can build something worth having,
you and I, if you'll let us.

39:18.512 --> 39:21.729
Your proposal is improving
by leaps and bounds.

39:25.165 --> 39:27.165
You must give me some time,

39:27.252 --> 39:30.209
but I promise to think about it. Properly.

39:31.775 --> 39:33.601
I'm counting on it.

40:03.607 --> 40:07.129
Those two can go right to the end,
right to the other end. Back you go.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.216
Her Ladyship had Mrs Patmore
make this up for you.

40:10.303 --> 40:11.695
So you could eat something during the day.

40:11.782 --> 40:13.521
Oh, another time.

40:13.783 --> 40:15.217
Dr Clarkson...

40:17.522 --> 40:21.740
Oh, Matthew,
I'm afraid I'm very busy, as you can see.

40:21.827 --> 40:23.175
Yes, I just want to help...

40:23.262 --> 40:24.436
Right over there.

40:31.220 --> 40:33.263
Is it what you thought it would be?

40:33.351 --> 40:37.482
No. No, it's more savage and more cruel
than I could have imagined.

40:37.569 --> 40:42.657
But, I feel useful for the first time in my life.
And that must be a good thing.

40:42.744 --> 40:45.092
- Matthew, are you busy?
- No, of course not.

40:46.701 --> 40:48.745
Let's get you into bed.

40:53.268 --> 40:57.269
So you wouldn't go back
to your life before the war?

40:57.486 --> 41:00.747
No. No, I could never
go back to that again.

41:15.271 --> 41:16.576
Lavinia?

41:21.359 --> 41:23.099
What's the matter?

41:23.794 --> 41:25.882
Are you looking for Matthew?

41:25.926 --> 41:28.578
I was. But it's not important.

41:32.796 --> 41:34.753
Tell me what it is. Please.

41:37.101 --> 41:40.581
He has to go a day early.
Tomorrow morning, in fact.

41:41.102 --> 41:44.712
Only to meet his General, surely?
Not back to France?

41:45.929 --> 41:48.190
But he must go back one day,

41:49.060 --> 41:51.669
and I can't stop thinking about
what I'd do if anything happened to him.

41:53.105 --> 41:55.235
I know he'll be all right.

41:56.105 --> 41:59.454
No, you don't. None of us do.

42:00.975 --> 42:04.150
We say that sort of
thing, but we don't know.

42:05.541 --> 42:07.368
If he died, I don't think
I could go on living.

42:14.847 --> 42:15.978
What's doing?

42:17.413 --> 42:18.804
Excuse me.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.980
Lavinia's a bit upset.

42:28.936 --> 42:32.068
She's awfully cut up
that I have to go early.

42:32.155 --> 42:35.069
But it's only to Coventry,
which doesn't sound too dangerous.

42:36.590 --> 42:38.373
If you're looking for Mother,
she's at the hospital.

42:38.461 --> 42:40.591
I've just come from there.

42:41.069 --> 42:42.852
Actually, it's you I came to see.

42:42.939 --> 42:44.418
Oh? How can I help?

42:46.549 --> 42:47.984
Mary, can you stay for luncheon?

42:50.550 --> 42:53.159
I can't. But thank you.

42:58.116 --> 42:59.421
So, what was your mission?

43:00.812 --> 43:02.116
Just to say...

43:05.248 --> 43:07.466
We hope you're still coming
for dinner tonight.

43:08.075 --> 43:09.596
Certainly we are. Why wouldn't we?

43:10.814 --> 43:13.380
Sure? It'll be your last evening.

43:14.336 --> 43:15.902
Why? Don't you want me?

43:15.989 --> 43:18.815
Of course I want you. Very much.

43:19.990 --> 43:21.598
I'm sorry you've had a wasted journey.

43:21.685 --> 43:25.643
Not at all. I needed an excuse for a walk.

43:27.164 --> 43:29.035
I'll see you at 8:00.

43:39.167 --> 43:40.254
Ethel said you wanted me.

43:40.341 --> 43:43.124
No, no. I just need a word with you.

43:44.168 --> 43:48.385
- If it's about that book, I'm afraid I...
- No. No, no, it's not about the book.

43:48.386 --> 43:50.125
What is it, then?

43:51.517 --> 43:55.257
I understand that Mr
Bates has gone for good.

43:56.127 --> 43:58.779
Yes. I believe that's true.

44:00.432 --> 44:05.780
So I was hoping we might be
able to see a little more of each other.

44:08.172 --> 44:13.303
Mr Molesley, I take this
as a real compliment.

44:16.217 --> 44:17.260
But it's not going to happen.

44:18.392 --> 44:21.696
No. You see...

44:24.349 --> 44:29.524
If you had a child
and that child was taken from you,

44:30.654 --> 44:33.220
if the child was sent to the moon,

44:33.785 --> 44:37.438
there'd never be one day
when they were out of your thoughts,

44:37.525 --> 44:40.787
nor one moment when you weren't
praying for their welfare.

44:40.874 --> 44:44.005
Even if you knew you'd
never see them again.

44:44.570 --> 44:45.831
And that's you and Mr Bates.

44:48.136 --> 44:50.180
That's me and Mr Bates.

44:52.572 --> 44:54.093
But thank you.

45:07.139 --> 45:08.357
I've kept you too long.

45:08.444 --> 45:10.922
You'd better get back,
or they'll come looking for you.

45:11.010 --> 45:14.140
- We've done a lot, haven't we?
- We have.

45:14.402 --> 45:16.228
I'll be forced to invent some tasks,

45:16.315 --> 45:17.794
or there'll be no need for you
to come much more.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.533
Then start inventing, please.

45:21.054 --> 45:24.969
I will. Because I'd hate it
if you were to stay away.

45:26.795 --> 45:30.926
So would I. I'd absolutely hate it.

45:44.668 --> 45:46.451
I can't believe I've done that.

45:46.537 --> 45:48.625
I'm awfully glad you did.

45:48.712 --> 45:51.235
You'll have me thrown in the tower.

45:51.321 --> 45:53.017
Only if they give me the key.

45:53.409 --> 45:56.322
Fold it in, don't slap it!

45:56.408 --> 45:59.453
You're making a cake, not beating a carpet!

46:00.149 --> 46:02.932
Oh, sorry, Your Lordship,
I didn't see you there.

46:03.019 --> 46:05.193
It's quite all right, Mrs Patmore.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.976
I wonder, is there somewhere
we could have a word?

46:08.846 --> 46:10.890
Why not go into my sitting room?

46:15.413 --> 46:16.630
Please sit.

46:20.456 --> 46:22.718
I do have some news of your nephew.

46:22.762 --> 46:25.240
I telephoned the War Office
and they have just come back to me.

46:25.327 --> 46:27.589
But I'm afraid it's not good news.

46:27.675 --> 46:29.502
I knew he was dead all along.

46:29.589 --> 46:33.373
I said so to my sister. I said, "Kate," I
said, "He's gone and you'll have to face..."

46:33.459 --> 46:35.329
Mrs Patmore, it's worse than that.

46:36.460 --> 46:38.678
But what can be worse than being dead?

46:41.417 --> 46:45.462
Private Philpotts was shot for cowardice
on the 17th of February.

46:46.679 --> 46:48.114
Oh, my God.

46:48.896 --> 46:53.202
This explains why the regiment
was reluctant to supply information.

46:58.986 --> 47:01.725
Mrs Hughes, could you come in, please?

47:11.422 --> 47:14.902
Mrs Patmore has had some bad news.
Her nephew has been killed.

47:14.988 --> 47:17.685
- Oh, he never has.
- And that's not all...

47:17.771 --> 47:20.163
It is all, Mrs Patmore.

47:20.685 --> 47:25.077
Let us make sure it is all. Your sister
needs to know no more than this.

47:26.642 --> 47:29.904
We cannot know the truth.
We should not judge.

47:34.861 --> 47:37.209
I think it's a ridiculous idea!

47:37.601 --> 47:40.993
- Why?
- Because this is a house, not a hospital!

47:41.080 --> 47:44.385
But, Granny, a convalescent home
is where people rest and recuperate.

47:44.472 --> 47:46.777
But if there are relapses, what then?

47:47.168 --> 47:50.865
Amputation in the dining room?
Resuscitation in the pantry?

47:50.951 --> 47:53.257
It would certainly be
the most tremendous disturbance.

47:53.343 --> 47:55.778
If you knew how chaotic
things are as it is.

47:55.865 --> 47:59.170
But when there's so much good can be done.

47:59.692 --> 48:00.736
I forbid it!

48:02.040 --> 48:06.041
To have strange men prodding
and prying around the house,

48:06.737 --> 48:09.389
to say nothing of pocketing the spoons!

48:09.912 --> 48:11.259
It's out of the question.

48:11.347 --> 48:13.607
I hesitate to remind you,
but this is my house now,

48:13.695 --> 48:16.999
Robert's and mine.
And we will make the decision.

48:23.044 --> 48:29.611
Oh, I see. So, now I'm an outsider
who need not be consulted?

48:29.697 --> 48:32.133
Since you put it like that, yes.

48:35.046 --> 48:37.525
What was it like at the hospital today?

48:40.786 --> 48:45.527
At the front,
the men pray to be spared, of course.

48:49.049 --> 48:51.093
But if that's not to be,

48:53.789 --> 48:57.007
they pray for a bullet
that kills them cleanly.

49:02.617 --> 49:06.617
For too many of them today,
that prayer had not been answered.

49:09.140 --> 49:11.314
We'll eat in about 20 minutes.

49:11.400 --> 49:14.183
Good. And would you have
any to spare for a poor traveler?

49:16.054 --> 49:17.749
William! I don't believe if!

49:17.837 --> 49:20.446
Pinch me. I am your dream come true.

49:20.707 --> 49:22.055
You're like a real soldier.

49:22.141 --> 49:25.447
I am a real soldier, thank you very much.
Now, come and give me a kiss.

49:25.533 --> 49:28.143
Oh, we'll have none of that!

49:28.230 --> 49:30.404
Won't you let a tommy
Kiss his sweetheart, Mrs Patmore,

49:30.491 --> 49:32.231
when he's off to fight the Hun?

49:32.317 --> 49:33.579
Have you finished your training?

49:33.622 --> 49:35.362
Not yet. But it won't be long now.

49:35.448 --> 49:38.971
Well, on the eve of departure, we'll see.
But right now, put her down.

49:41.275 --> 49:44.059
- So, what do you think?
- There.

49:44.276 --> 49:46.363
WILLIAMS Smart, ain't it?

49:50.581 --> 49:54.496
William, what a treat to see you.

49:54.843 --> 49:56.800
And how smart you look.

49:57.235 --> 49:59.148
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

49:59.453 --> 50:02.366
Supper won't be long.
I'm just going up to clear the dining room.

50:02.453 --> 50:03.714
Shall I help?

50:03.802 --> 50:06.367
Course not. You're in the army now.

50:08.628 --> 50:11.411
So, still full of the joys of warfare?

50:12.455 --> 50:15.456
I'm not sorry to be part of it, Mr Lang,
and I can't pretend I am.

50:15.803 --> 50:18.065
Oh, yes, you're part of it.

50:18.151 --> 50:22.501
Like a metal cog is part of a factory,
or a grain of sand is part of the beach.

50:22.587 --> 50:24.849
It's all right, Mr Lang. I understand.

50:25.501 --> 50:28.936
And I'm not saying I'm important
or owt like that.

50:29.023 --> 50:31.154
But I believe in this war.

50:31.763 --> 50:35.807
I believe in what we're fighting for
and I want to do my bit.

50:37.373 --> 50:38.547
Then God help you.

50:53.158 --> 50:55.463
Edith seems jolly tonight.

50:55.549 --> 50:58.985
She's found her mÃ©tier... Farm laboring.

50:59.812 --> 51:01.638
Don't be so tough on her.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.986
That's like asking the fox
to spare the chicken.

51:06.334 --> 51:10.248
What about you? Last time you told me
good news was imminent.

51:10.857 --> 51:13.814
- Would you be happy if it were?
- Of course.

51:14.640 --> 51:18.423
I've found someone now,
and I want you to do the same.

51:21.163 --> 51:24.033
If you'd taken another minute
to make up your mind, sir,

51:24.163 --> 51:26.425
we'd all have marched over the cliff!

51:26.512 --> 51:29.512
And I'll tell you something else as well...

51:29.599 --> 51:33.383
William's got more to say
than a parliamentary candidate.

51:34.209 --> 51:37.166
- What's the matter?
- I know it's my fault,

51:37.340 --> 51:41.558
but, I wish I hadn't let him think
that we're like Sweethearts,

51:41.688 --> 51:43.950
because we're not.
Not by my reckoning, anyway.

51:44.036 --> 51:47.602
Too late
for second thoughts now, Missy.

51:48.255 --> 51:50.908
You don't have to marry him
when it comes to it,

51:51.038 --> 51:54.082
but you can't let him go to war
with a broken heart,

51:54.212 --> 51:55.386
or he won't come back.

51:59.301 --> 52:01.214
What a time we've had.

52:02.040 --> 52:05.954
Poor Sir Richard must have thought
he'd come to a madhouse.

52:06.259 --> 52:08.737
I don't expect it'll put him off.

52:13.912 --> 52:15.564
I'm going to accept him.

52:19.869 --> 52:21.782
Do you think I should?

52:22.914 --> 52:24.957
That's not for me to say.

52:28.566 --> 52:33.132
If you love him more than anyone in
the world then of course you should.

52:34.090 --> 52:36.481
- It's not as simple as that.
- No?

52:37.959 --> 52:41.787
It is for me, but then
I'm not Your Ladyship.

52:45.961 --> 52:49.918
Did you love Bates
more than anyone else in the world?

52:51.136 --> 52:53.440
I did. I do.

52:55.441 --> 52:58.920
I'll never love again
like I love him. Never.

53:02.095 --> 53:04.138
Well, there you are, then.

53:04.355 --> 53:09.009
One day you'll meet someone else
and you'll marry.

53:10.444 --> 53:15.879
Perhaps it will be second best,
but it doesn't mean you can't have a life.

53:19.489 --> 53:21.359
I think it does for me.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.491
Are you sure you should be
doing this, Carson?

53:28.621 --> 53:30.709
We've managed very well with Mrs Hughes.

53:30.795 --> 53:32.230
Quite sure, milord.

53:32.318 --> 53:35.317
And breakfast is not a taxing assignment.

53:36.796 --> 53:38.970
Edith, this is a message for you.

53:39.058 --> 53:41.319
Mrs Drake writes that
they've decided to hire a man,

53:41.406 --> 53:44.145
so they won't be needing you any more.

53:44.233 --> 53:45.581
Is that all she says?

53:45.624 --> 53:48.233
Oh, well, she's very grateful. Here we are.

53:48.320 --> 53:50.799
She says she and Drake
send their thanks to you

53:50.886 --> 53:53.539
for giving up so much
of your valuable time.

53:54.190 --> 53:55.799
I expect it's rather a relief.

53:57.582 --> 54:01.323
Oh, I wouldn't say that. Not entirely.

54:01.583 --> 54:03.018
Has Lady Sybil gone already?

54:03.148 --> 54:05.758
She had a tray at 6:30.
She would.

54:05.845 --> 54:08.323
Carson, have they told you
we're to be turned into a hospital?

54:08.454 --> 54:10.324
A convalescent home.

54:11.150 --> 54:13.498
I'm afraid we've all bullied you
into the whole thing.

54:14.368 --> 54:16.325
I hope you're not dreading it too much.

54:16.455 --> 54:19.630
Not dreading it exactly, but it's a
brave new world we're headed for,

54:19.717 --> 54:21.717
no doubt about that.

54:21.847 --> 54:25.022
We must try to meet it
with as much grace as we can muster.
