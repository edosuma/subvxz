<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.115 --> 00:16.776
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.619
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>It was Monday morning...</i>

00:21.721 --> 00:23.916
<i>and Michael Bluth</i>
<i>was nervous about meeting...</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:26.458
<i>with the new prosecutor</i>
<i>ofhis father's criminal case.</i>

00:26.559 --> 00:28.754
I don't know what you're
so nervous about, Michael.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.989
It's a new prosecutor.
It's a whole new beginning...

00:31.097 --> 00:34.589
a new day, a new case,
a whole new set of lies.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.397
- I'm not lying anymore, Mom.
- <i>[Narrator] Michael was lying.</i>

00:37.504 --> 00:39.495
<i>He found his fugitive father</i>
<i>earlier in the week...</i>

00:39.606 --> 00:41.506
<i>and he was hiding him</i>
<i>in the attic...</i>

00:41.608 --> 00:44.441
<i>where George Sr. Was currently</i>
<i>waiting for his breakfast.</i>

00:44.544 --> 00:46.705
About the business,
just for the record...

00:46.813 --> 00:49.373
I was not involved with Dad
building houses in Iraq.

00:49.482 --> 00:52.110
- That's exactly what I'm gonna tell them.
- Is that for Lindsay?

00:52.218 --> 00:54.379
<i>Because she's not scared</i>
<i>to eat in front of me anymore.</i>

00:54.487 --> 00:56.387
<i>Those are</i>
<i>the whites only, yes?</i>

00:56.489 --> 00:59.151
These aren't for Lindsay.
These are mine.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.159
Anyway, I'm not lying
anymore either, Michael.

01:01.261 --> 01:04.162
I'm being lied...

01:04.263 --> 01:06.164
- on.
- [Gasps]

01:06.266 --> 01:08.291
Wow. Now more's gonna
come up than go down.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.171
I gotta get outta here.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.332
- Hmm?
- <i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

01:15.442 --> 01:19.708
I mean, she's just
so loving and affectionate.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.008
L- l-This is not the woman
I fell in love with.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.242
Oscar, please. You can't go.
You gotta stay, okay?

01:24.350 --> 01:27.285
This is the nicest she's been since
she found out Rosa could breast-feed Buster.

01:27.387 --> 01:30.754
Oh, Buster. Don't even bring that up.
He's well into his army training.

01:30.857 --> 01:34.156
<i>[Narrator] Actually, Buster had</i>
<i>hit a wall in his army training.</i>

01:34.260 --> 01:37.354
I can't do it! I can't make my bed,
and I can't do this either!

01:37.464 --> 01:41.628
Aren't you supposed to yell at me and call me
"homo" and motivate me over this wall?

01:41.734 --> 01:43.861
We can't do that anymore. Lawsuit.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.302
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, it was a recent ruling...</i>

01:46.406 --> 01:49.603
<i>prosecuted by the same man</i>
<i>who Michael was soon to meet with.</i>

01:49.709 --> 01:52.507
It's going to be a long time
before Sergeant Wendell Baker...

01:52.612 --> 01:55.103
calls someone
"Private Homo" again.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.274
God willing,
he'll fail boot camp.

01:57.383 --> 01:59.817
Well, why wouldn't he?
He already failed day camp.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.444
- Hey.
- Hi. Hey, Dad.

02:02.555 --> 02:05.490
- <i>You ready for the prosecutor?</i>
- Hi. I hope so.

02:05.592 --> 02:08.151
- How'd that math test work out?
- Oh, it was okay, I guess.

02:08.261 --> 02:10.627
But- I don't know.
It was weird. I studied with Ann...

02:10.729 --> 02:12.630
but I still got a B-minus.

02:12.732 --> 02:16.964
- Ann got you a B-minus?
- Well, it wasn't Ann. She's an expert in math.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.800
- Isn't that cute?
- Is it?

02:19.906 --> 02:22.067
<i>[Narrator] Michael felt his son</i>
<i>was setting the bar too low...</i>

02:22.175 --> 02:24.473
<i>with his dating standards.</i>

02:24.577 --> 02:30.015
No, it wasn't Ann's fault. I think I just
ended up thinkin' about the questions too long.

02:30.116 --> 02:32.710
And so, by the time I put
an answer down, I went with, like...

02:32.819 --> 02:34.719
my fifth choice
or somethin' like that.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.982
George Michael,
never settle for fifth choice.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.150
Something better is gonna come along.
She just has to.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.990
I think maybe sitting in the back
of the class with Ann is a bad idea.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.428
You know,
she's just so pretty.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.898
- I get distracted, I guess.
- Do you?

02:48.001 --> 02:51.562
- I wish I could draw her nose.
- Maybe it's your eyes.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.099
Maybe you need glasses...
for your grades.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.108
Didn't you say you had
a hard time readin' the board...

02:57.210 --> 02:59.735
- sittin' in the back row?
- No, I said I was in the back of the classroom.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.746
- That's what I mean. Yeah?
- It's different. No. No.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.442
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.519
- No, definitely. I'll call the eye doctor.
- I guess.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.917
I'm gonna set you up
an appointment. Okay?

03:09.022 --> 03:11.217
- <i>Hey, gang.</i>
- Tobias.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.918
Oh. Ooh, I'm afraid I'll have to
take them to go. I'm late for the gym.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.927
Oh, and also,
here's a number...

03:16.029 --> 03:19.055
in case the Blue Man Group
calls and needs an understudy.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.963
I just found out
that my cellular telephone was a lemon.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.298
- It didn't work.
- [Hoarse Voice] Neither do you.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.464
- [Scoffs]
- Pretty brave card for <i>you</i> to play.

03:27.574 --> 03:30.042
- I just can't stand it. Tobias getting in shape...
- <i>[Door Closing]</i>

03:30.143 --> 03:32.043
For a bunch
of slutty gym rats.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.773
- What's wrong with your voice?
- Nothing. I've been going out.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.315
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Lindsay had been frequenting singles clubs...</i>

03:37.417 --> 03:39.715
<i>also still hoping to make</i>
<i>her open marriage work</i>- 

03:39.819 --> 03:42.413
- Whoo!
- <i>which it won't.</i>

03:42.522 --> 03:45.286
- I didn't catch that.
- Whoo!

03:48.828 --> 03:51.262
I wonder how many women
he's slept with, if any.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.264
Lindsay, it's not
a competition.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.062
Of course it is, Michael.
That's why they call it scoring.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.570
- Maybe in the '70s.
- That many? We've only
been doing this for a month.

03:59.672 --> 04:02.072
Instead of competing with Tobias,
why don't you try spending...

04:02.175 --> 04:04.609
- a little more time with your daughter?
- Why? Tobias doing that?

04:04.711 --> 04:07.077
- <i>[Narrator] At that moment, Lindsay's daughter...</i>
- <i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

04:07.180 --> 04:10.445
- <i>was in the process of wooing her own man.</i>
- Who is it?

04:10.550 --> 04:14.816
- Steve Holt!
- <i>Maeby had even started</i>
<i>ordering unnecessary items...</i>

04:14.921 --> 04:16.821
<i>just to have more occasions</i>
<i>to see him.</i>

04:16.923 --> 04:18.982
Uh, you ordered a "Memories
ofThanksgiving" basket?

04:19.091 --> 04:22.994
- Wow, that looks great.
- <i>[Hoarsely] Maeby, who's your friend?</i>

04:23.096 --> 04:26.031
- Is this your sister?
- No.

04:26.132 --> 04:28.191
<i>But you just made my day.</i>

04:28.301 --> 04:30.997
Thank you for the basket.
See ya.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.935
[Singsong]
He thinks I'm cute.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.737
He's 19. He's a senior
at my high school.

04:37.844 --> 04:40.438
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And had been for several years.</i>

04:44.651 --> 04:46.278
<i>[Lindsay]</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

04:46.386 --> 04:49.378
I think I <i>am</i> gonna spend more time
with my daughter.

04:51.090 --> 04:54.116
I can't promise you I won't tell
the prosecutor about that.

04:56.896 --> 05:00.889
- Where you been?
- Are you wearing my
dead wife's maternity clothes?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.560
Yeah. It's the only thing
I could find.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.730
- <i>Where are the eggs?</i>
- Doctor says they're bad for the baby.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.468
- So, you ready for this new prosecutor?
- I was until you came back.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.476
You're not gonna
turn me in, are you?

05:12.578 --> 05:15.741
Because I had no idea there were sanctions
against, uh, Iraq.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.316
<i>You know, th-they sent me over there.</i>
<i>They said, "Go build."</i>

05:18.418 --> 05:21.410
Uh- Uh, Do I look like
a criminal mastermind to you?

05:21.521 --> 05:24.547
How do you get this ham open?
I can't- I can't get this ham open.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.592
I'm not gonna turn you in. But you have put me
in a position where I'm gonna have to lie.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.594
Why did you come back here
in the first place?

05:29.696 --> 05:33.723
Oh, no reason. Your mother happens
to be <i>shtupping</i> my brother, that's all.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.733
<i>I'm only here to find out</i>
<i>if I have a shot with her.</i>

05:35.835 --> 05:39.066
If she's really in love with Oscar-
I don't know- to hell with her.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.572
I'll just-
I'll just leave.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.936
- I'll never come back.
- Great. She's really in love with him.

05:46.045 --> 05:49.344
That's very funny.
I need you to find out, okay?

05:49.449 --> 05:51.417
<i>'Cause ever since</i>
<i>l</i>- <i>I heard about this</i>- 

05:51.517 --> 05:53.644
[Breathes Deeply]
I can't sleep.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.085
I can't- I can't eat.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.784
Oh. Look, it just peels off.
Isn't that clever?

05:59.892 --> 06:03.988
<i>[Narrator] Later that day,</i>
<i>George Michael was having his eye exam...</i>

06:04.097 --> 06:06.531
<i>and finding it to be just as difficult</i>
<i>as his math exam.</i>

06:06.632 --> 06:09.032
- One or two?
- Two. No. No, one.

06:09.135 --> 06:12.696
- Okay. Two or three?
- Three.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.906
Uh, unless three is too much
of an improvement.

06:16.008 --> 06:18.704
I'm sorry.
Is one- Is one in the mix still?

06:18.811 --> 06:21.939
<i>[Narrator] And Michael met</i>
<i>with the new prosecutor, WayneJarvis.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:24.573
I'm sorry. I don't understand
how this is not a conflict of interest.

06:24.684 --> 06:26.777
You almost represented us,
and now you're the prosecutor.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.786
The Patriot Act. Read it.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.322
L-I'm not even the president anymore.
My brother Gob is.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.619
<i>I spoke with Gob.</i>
<i>He appears to know nothing.</i>

06:33.726 --> 06:36.456
<i>Yeah, that's not an act.</i>
<i>He twice tried to microwave...</i>

06:36.562 --> 06:38.621
<i>a Ding Dong</i>
<i>while it was still in its foil.</i>

06:38.731 --> 06:40.392
- Twice.
- Twice?

06:40.500 --> 06:44.630
- Two times.
- <i>[Narrator] In fact, Gob had been grilled earlier.</i>

06:44.737 --> 06:47.570
- I don't know anything about the business!
- We're gonna get you, Bluth.

06:47.673 --> 06:50.836
We'll give you a few minutes
to think about what you want to do.

06:53.679 --> 06:56.011
He knows less than anyone
we have ever questioned.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.583
<i>[Narrator] Gob knew too little</i>
<i>to know that, however...</i>

06:58.684 --> 07:02.176
<i>and his confidence</i>
<i>had never been more shaken.</i>

07:02.288 --> 07:05.587
<i>Andjust when he thought he couldn't</i>
<i>handle another embarrassment</i>- 

07:05.691 --> 07:07.591
You're free to go.

07:07.693 --> 07:11.629
<i>Things could get very messy for you, Michael,</i>
<i>unless you have something to bargain with...</i>

07:11.731 --> 07:14.165
like, say, a fugitive.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.599
- I don't know where to find such a thing.
- <i>Look harder.</i>

07:16.702 --> 07:19.933
- There might be something in it for you.
- Something to get me off?

07:20.039 --> 07:22.837
<i>If</i> you could find
a certain someone.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.537
Can I have a moment alone
with my client, please?

07:26.646 --> 07:30.082
Did you follow any of that?

07:30.183 --> 07:32.549
Yeah. He's hinting that
he's gonna grant me immunity...

07:32.652 --> 07:34.847
but only on the condition
that I turn in my father.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.855
You know where your father is?
No, wait. Don't tell me now.

07:37.957 --> 07:41.484
<i>Okay. If you know,</i>
<i>give me a high five.</i>

07:43.129 --> 07:45.029
Mm-mmm.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.466
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael hadjust found out...</i>

07:50.570 --> 07:54.563
- <i>that his legal problems might go away</i>
<i>ifhe turned in his father.</i>
- <i>[Beeps]</i>

07:54.674 --> 07:56.642
It's just you and me now, huh?

07:56.742 --> 08:01.202
No, Barry, l- I know
where my father is, okay?

08:01.314 --> 08:04.477
He came back to make sure that my mother
wasn't really in love with my uncle.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.815
He wants to know if he's still got a shot with her.
If he doesn't, he's leaving.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.548
If he's got a shot with her,
just give me a little tap on the fanny.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.556
- That's not gonna happen.
- Okay.

08:12.658 --> 08:16.389
Then look, just tell him anything
he wants to hear to keep him from running.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.760
We just have to keep him here
until we can hear...

08:18.865 --> 08:20.765
what kind of deal
they're offering you.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.200
You just trust me.
I'm a lot more competent than you can imagine.

08:26.038 --> 08:29.007
Oh, I forgot to take
the tinfoil off too.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.008
I really wanted that.

08:31.110 --> 08:34.169
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Buster, meanwhile, was sharing his failure...</i>

08:34.280 --> 08:36.009
<i>with someone who was</i>
<i>well-versed on the subject.</i>

08:36.115 --> 08:40.107
I mean, I couldn't get over the wall.
They put me on suspension until I can.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.448
Perhaps you need to find somebody
who can motivate you.

08:42.554 --> 08:45.285
- Yeah, but who?
- <i>[Narrator] And then it hit him.</i>

08:45.391 --> 08:48.519
<i>[Narrator] Gob had always proven</i>
<i>a good motivator for Buster.</i>

08:48.628 --> 08:52.086
- Do it!
- [Blow Lands]
- [Groans]

08:52.198 --> 08:55.292
When you do this without getting punched
in the chest, you'll have more fun.

08:55.401 --> 08:58.063
- [Weakly] Thanks, Brother.
- Hey, Brother...

08:58.170 --> 09:00.798
how would you like to go
to the old playground with me?

09:00.907 --> 09:04.308
I'm sure as hell not gonna go back to work.
I'm never going back there.

09:04.410 --> 09:08.813
Oh. Well, then perchance I might be able
to borrow your cellular telephone?

09:08.915 --> 09:11.315
I'm not fit
to run a company.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.317
And I don't deserve
a fancy phone.

09:13.419 --> 09:17.549
Well, the Blue Man Group might need me.
And I <i>do</i> deserve a fancy phone.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.057
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>They didn't, and he doesn't.</i>

09:20.159 --> 09:22.627
<i>Michael knew he couldn't</i>
<i>let his father get away.</i>

09:22.728 --> 09:26.186
<i>So he decided to see ifhis mother</i>
<i>and Oscar really were in love.</i>

09:26.299 --> 09:29.632
So, come on. Aren't you really just dating
Oscar to get back at Dad?

09:29.735 --> 09:32.260
Oh, it may have
started as that...

09:32.371 --> 09:36.239
but I have
fallen in love with Oscar.

09:36.342 --> 09:39.072
And it's so nice not to have to worry
about getting pregnant.

09:39.178 --> 09:42.170
The doctor said
I couldn't be a mother now if I tried.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.306
And that was without
even interviewing me.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.408
Here you go. Hot tea.

09:46.519 --> 09:49.750
Because that's what you are-
a hottie.

09:53.359 --> 09:56.692
Stop me from pouring this on myself.
I can't take this anymore.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.696
All right. Now, listen, Oscar.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.993
Maybe you should think
about moving on, you know.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.934
This really isn't your scene,
with the sweaters and the furniture.

10:05.037 --> 10:08.006
Maybe you should take a leap at freedom,
like my father.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.007
Just run.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.044
- <i>[Air Horn Blasts]</i>
- Is that her rape horn?

10:13.145 --> 10:16.376
It's more like
a starter's pistol.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.043
[Whispers]
Run.

10:22.388 --> 10:25.482
<i>[Narrator] Meanwhile, Tobias set about</i>
<i>learning how to operate his new cell phone.</i>

10:25.591 --> 10:28.059
- [Melody]
- Oh!

10:28.160 --> 10:31.095
<i>[Narrator] And Lindsay tried to spend</i>
<i>more time getting to know her daughter.</i>

10:31.197 --> 10:34.792
[Hoarsely]
Hi, baby. Oh, Steve. Hi.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.130
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

10:37.236 --> 10:39.397
I thought I'd spend a little time
with my daughter.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.837
After all, it hasn't been that long
since <i>I've</i> been in high school.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.966
- <i>[Bell Rings]</i>
- Is that a fire?

10:44.076 --> 10:47.409
- We have to go to class.
- Okay. Well, this was fun.

10:47.513 --> 10:52.314
Maybe later we can all spend a little
more time together. Go shopping. Get a drink.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.648
<i>I'm in school.</i>
<i>And I'm 15.</i>

10:54.754 --> 10:58.656
Oh. Well, I'm much, much, much...

10:58.758 --> 11:00.658
older than 15.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.661
- You don't look it.
- Oh, Steve.

11:03.763 --> 11:06.527
He thinks I'm young.
You made my day again!

11:06.632 --> 11:09.226
[Laughing]

11:11.337 --> 11:14.465
- Your mom's pretty, uh, out there.
- She's not my mom.

11:14.573 --> 11:16.564
But she said
you were her daughter.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.008
His daughter.
That's my dad.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.773
- That's a dude?
- And the worst part is...

11:21.881 --> 11:23.781
he thinks he's passing.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.946
<i>[Narrator] Right outside the school,</i>
<i>Buster tried to put his own plan...</i>

11:30.056 --> 11:32.422
<i>into action</i>
<i>by stirring up old memories.</i>

11:32.525 --> 11:35.688
What do you say?
I need your help to get over the wall. Push me.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.729
I'm the pathetic one, Buster,
not you.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.355
I totally freaked out in front
of that prosecutor today.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.299
Like a little girl
in a little dress-

11:43.402 --> 11:46.371
little saddle shoes,
little pigtails.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.702
Wow, that does sound
like a little girl.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.935
<i>Come on, get my ire up.</i>

11:51.043 --> 11:52.943
Push me!
[Chuckles]

11:53.045 --> 11:54.945
Oh.

11:57.016 --> 11:59.814
Oh, this is turning out to be
much more fun than I'd hoped.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.581
<i>[Narrator] It was fun. But it wasn't</i>
<i>making him a better soldier.</i>

12:02.688 --> 12:04.588
Push me higher.
[Chuckles]

12:04.690 --> 12:06.658
Ooh! I'll do it.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.760
Whoo!

12:09.862 --> 12:13.195
<i>[Narrator] And Michael reported to</i>
<i>his father about his meeting with the prosecutor.</i>

12:13.299 --> 12:15.699
- Prosecutor offer you a deal?
- That was not said.

12:15.801 --> 12:21.068
But, uh, more importantly, you should know
that it seems like Oscar's on his way out.

12:21.173 --> 12:24.734
- Really?
- Yeah. So just sit tight,
and everything should be fine.

12:26.278 --> 12:29.076
<i>Wow. Hey, by the way,</i>
<i>I broke this thing. L</i>- 

12:29.181 --> 12:31.979
- What the hell is it anyway?
- That's a breast pump, Dad.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.281
Oh. Well, I did not
use it for that.

12:35.387 --> 12:38.686
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And so Michael went to meet the prosecutor.</i>

12:38.791 --> 12:40.816
I felt obligated to share
some photographs with you.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.087
I obtained these from
the Bluth Company e-mail server.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.595
You tapped into our e-mail?
That's legal?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.598
I'm going for a hot Ding Dong.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.635
Hot Ding Dong? Yeah?

12:50.736 --> 12:54.433
Michael, this is a close-up satellite photograph
of the Iraqi countryside.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.031
See this little series of hills
around that stream?

12:57.143 --> 12:59.134
Those are bunkers.
We believe that those bunkers...

12:59.245 --> 13:01.372
contain weapons
of mass destruction.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.314
We also think that your father
was building on that land to hide them.

13:05.417 --> 13:08.113
Which is why that photograph
was on <i>his</i> e-mail.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.848
- Are you serious?
- Almost always.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.323
I was once called the worst audience
participant Cirque Du Soleil ever had.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.623
- This is a big accusation.
- I did not find their buffoonery amusing.

13:17.730 --> 13:22.463
- About my father.
- He's guilty, Michael, of medium to heavy treason.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.661
That proves it.
You can't protect him.

13:24.770 --> 13:27.637
Turn him in
and immunity is yours.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.509
- <i>[Narrator] Michael returned home</i>
<i>to confront his father.</i>
- <i>Michael?</i>

13:32.611 --> 13:34.511
Mom was just here
looking for you.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.808
She's claiming Oscar's disappeared
because of something you said.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.884
- Can't talk right now.
- Really?

13:38.984 --> 13:40.975
What's wrong with <i>your</i> voice?

13:41.086 --> 13:43.680
I can talk, sure.
I didn't say anything to Oscar.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.689
- Anything else?
- No.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.726
Oh. Hey, did I tell you?
I accidentally ran into Steve Holt.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.388
Wow. Everything about you
is so womanly.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.658
You're everything
a woman should be.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.360
[Hoarsely]
Thank you, Steve.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.060
We ended up
making a lunch date.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.104
I thought you were
spending time with Maeby.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.197
Yeah. I'll have to
reschedule her.

14:02.308 --> 14:06.404
But Mom isn't the only one "finding love"
where she least expects it. Her words.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.278
Wh-Whoa! Finding love-
She said that? Where, here?

14:10.382 --> 14:12.282
Yeah, she won't
shut up about him.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.352
She said "tingling,"
like, 75 times.

14:14.453 --> 14:19.220
<i>[Lucille] Gets me tingling.</i>
<i>And, you know, with Oscar there's tingling.</i>

14:19.325 --> 14:23.523
- She said those words in this house?
- Yeah.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.358
Dad?

14:25.464 --> 14:27.364
Hello?

14:32.304 --> 14:35.467
<i>[Narrator] Michael hadjust discovered</i>
<i>that his father had escaped from the attic.</i>

14:35.574 --> 14:37.474
Hello?

14:37.576 --> 14:40.101
This is gonna sound like a strange question,
but have you seen Dad?

14:40.212 --> 14:42.112
Of course not.
And I'm not talking to you.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.648
You tried to scare away Oscar,
which didn't work.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.583
- He's back.
- I just, uh-

14:47.686 --> 14:50.985
I just wanted to have sex with you.
That's-That's all I'm good for.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.650
Did you hear that?
He said he just wants to-

14:53.759 --> 14:56.250
- Good-bye, Mom.
- Have sex with me.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.991
- You smell like a pinecone.
- Yeah, that's the weed.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.626
I went to my, uh,
my- [Bleeps] hole trailer...

15:04.737 --> 15:06.932
and l- I smoked some
like a cigarette.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.473
Should we take it
into the bedroom?

15:10.743 --> 15:14.008
- Only if you really love me.
- Of course I do.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.115
[Inhales]
Ohh.

15:19.218 --> 15:21.118
[Muttering]

15:21.220 --> 15:23.620
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>
<i>Where are you going?</i>

15:23.722 --> 15:25.747
I'm on mushrooms!

15:25.858 --> 15:28.759
I'm on bad mushrooms!

15:28.861 --> 15:31.489
<i>[Narrator] And soon,</i>
<i>the prosecutor's evidence became public.</i>

15:31.597 --> 15:36.534
We've obtained photographs that officials
call definite proof of W.M.D.'s in Iraq.

15:36.635 --> 15:38.933
What that means
for your weekend at 10:00.

15:39.038 --> 15:42.667
<i>[Narrator] It seems that due</i>
<i>to the new information-sharing provisions...</i>

15:42.775 --> 15:45.209
<i>in the Patriot Act, the photos</i>
<i>had made the rounds...</i>

15:45.311 --> 15:48.337
<i>through several branches</i>
<i>of government...</i>

15:48.447 --> 15:50.574
<i>and ultimately</i>
<i>to the U.S. Army itself.</i>

15:50.683 --> 15:52.810
I just came back to tell you.
I can't do that wall.

15:52.918 --> 15:55.148
There's no time for that.
We're shipping out without you.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.313
- What?
- Didn't you see?

15:57.423 --> 16:02.122
- <i>[Man] Pick it up. Pick it up.</i>
- Weapons of mass destruction?

16:02.227 --> 16:04.354
- [Gob] Those bastards.
- I did not say that.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.365
Are you gonna let that slide?
Are you gonna allow your children...

16:08.467 --> 16:10.492
and your children's children...

16:10.602 --> 16:12.570
and any children
that I might have out there...

16:12.671 --> 16:15.401
to live in fear
for the rest of their lives?

16:15.507 --> 16:18.340
Climb that wall, homo!

16:18.444 --> 16:20.378
Climb it.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.346
<i>[Narrator] Andjust as the men</i>
<i>thought the day could get no more surprising...</i>

16:23.449 --> 16:25.349
- [Yelling]
- <i>it did.</i>

16:25.451 --> 16:27.351
- Ohh! Ooh!
- <i>[Thuds]</i>

16:27.453 --> 16:30.911
- <i>[Whimpering]</i>
- When you do this without getting
punched, you'll have more fun.

16:31.023 --> 16:34.424
- Oh, hey, George Michael.
- Oh, hi.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.517
They found W.M.D.'s in Iraq,
so we got a half-day.

16:36.628 --> 16:39.597
Cool. So I got
a "C" on my math test.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.928
Not anticipating
a good reaction on that.

16:42.034 --> 16:45.526
Well, the "B" got you glasses.
Maybe this time you'll get a neck brace.

16:45.637 --> 16:48.936
Anyways, have you seen my mom?

16:49.041 --> 16:50.941
Seems possible.

16:51.043 --> 16:53.341
- She's on her way to meet Steve Holt.
- I thought <i>you</i> liked him.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.743
I do. I'm crazy about him.
But he's obsessed with her.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.748
<i>That's all he wants</i>
<i>to talk about.</i>

16:57.850 --> 17:00.410
<i>[Narrator] Lindsay felt bad.</i>
<i>Perhaps she had hurt her daughter...</i>

17:00.519 --> 17:02.419
<i>by putting herself first.</i>

17:02.521 --> 17:05.012
<i>But she would have felt worse</i>
<i>if she'd remained even a moment longer.</i>

17:05.124 --> 17:07.455
But it's only because
he thinks she's got a penis.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.720
Oh, I told him
she was a tranny.

17:09.828 --> 17:12.126
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was still up in the attic.</i>

17:12.231 --> 17:14.494
Dad, what's goin' on?
Somebody could see you.

17:14.599 --> 17:18.036
What's the difference, Mike?
You're turning me in, aren't you?

17:18.137 --> 17:20.970
They say you're involved in something
real big, Dad. They've got photos.

17:21.073 --> 17:23.439
Not true. But go.
Knock yourself out. Turn me in.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.772
<i>I went and I saw for myself.</i>

17:26.878 --> 17:28.779
She's in love with him.

17:31.683 --> 17:34.481
<i>Then why did you come back?</i>
<i>Why didn't you just leave forever like you said?</i>

17:34.586 --> 17:36.486
And go where?

17:36.588 --> 17:39.455
[Sighs]
Make a deal for yourself, Mike.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.549
I got no love
in my life anymore.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.094
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Michael realized for the first time...</i>

17:44.196 --> 17:47.825
<i>that his father was capable</i>
<i>ofhaving his heart broken.</i>

17:47.933 --> 17:50.060
<i>Later that day,</i>
<i>Michael had his meeting with the prosecutor.</i>

17:50.169 --> 17:53.332
So, where the hell is he?
Come on, Bluth. What's it gonna be?

17:53.439 --> 17:55.999
Your father or your freedom?

17:56.108 --> 17:58.508
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Michael had to do the right thing.</i>

17:58.610 --> 18:01.135
I don't know
what happened to him.

18:03.615 --> 18:06.641
Michael, when we started talking to you,
we didn't have anything.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.482
But now... we got something.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.489
- And you're gonna do time for it.
- Those are the pictures?

18:12.591 --> 18:14.991
They're all over the news.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.460
- Those are balls.
- What?

18:17.563 --> 18:20.930
<i>[Narrator] Barry was right. Tobias had</i>
<i>inadvertently photographed himself...</i>

18:21.033 --> 18:22.933
<i>while learning to use</i>
<i>his camera phone.</i>

18:23.035 --> 18:26.198
See, uh, this close,
they always look like landscape.

18:26.305 --> 18:29.502
Nope, you're lookin' at balls.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.168
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Soon, forensic scientists confirmed this.</i>

18:32.277 --> 18:34.302
<i>And for the second time</i>
<i>in two days...</i>

18:34.413 --> 18:37.849
<i>the information-sharing network</i>
<i>put into place by the Patriot Act...</i>

18:37.950 --> 18:39.850
<i>was put to use.</i>

18:39.952 --> 18:42.716
They're balls?

18:42.821 --> 18:44.721
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>We're looking at balls. Let's turn it around.</i>

18:44.823 --> 18:46.723
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Copy on balls. We're turning.</i>

18:46.825 --> 18:49.293
<i>And eventually, the news</i>
<i>traveled back to the source.</i>

18:49.394 --> 18:52.886
We got one wrong,
and we do apologize.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.360
I'm on TV.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.700
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Michael returned home a free man.</i>

19:00.806 --> 19:04.037
You got the glasses.
Now you'll do better on those math exams.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.579
I think I blew the eye exam too.
Every time I take these off, I feel better.

19:07.679 --> 19:10.705
Let me see 'em.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.910
- I've seen this before.
- <i>[Narrator] For a while, George Michael...</i>

19:14.019 --> 19:16.283
<i>had shared a room</i>
<i>with his Uncle Tobias.</i>

19:16.388 --> 19:18.982
- Oh, th-there's a ladder.
- [Groaning] I don't need it.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.894
Yeah, I don't think
you need glasses, Son.

19:25.197 --> 19:28.360
Well, if the cops are waiting,
I'm ready to go.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.435
I got nothin'
since your mother deserted me.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.436
You know,
you-you deserted her, Dad.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.438
You know, you escaped,
and then you faked your death.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.838
I'm not so sure she sees you
as that reliable.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.274
But, listen,
for what it's worth...

19:39.378 --> 19:41.278
I did not turn you in.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.116
- You didn't?
- No.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.777
And I don't know whether
it's just Tracy's maternity clothes...

19:47.886 --> 19:51.549
but it's very nice to see
a softer side of you.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.956
Although I'm sorry that you feel
you have no love in your life.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.460
Well, I don't-
I don't feel that way anymore.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.932
Thanks.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.798
Been a long time
since someone stood up for me.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.967
- Found her perfume, huh?
- Just a little left in the bottle.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.135
- Well, that was the end of it.
- Yeah.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.145
- It's nice on you.
- Thank you.

You know what? I was hoping
we could go to dinner tonight.

20:42.841 --> 20:45.309
Oh, I thought you were gonna
go see Steve Holt at school.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.310
No, I just wanted
to check him out...

20:47.412 --> 20:50.176
and make sure he's good enough
for my daughter.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.648
- Is it-
- It's a "Sheh-ma-lee."
