WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.959
- Emma, we have a connection.

00:03.003 --> 00:04.613
I don't think you have
that with Devon.

00:04.656 --> 00:05.788
[Devon]: Is that room service?

00:05.831 --> 00:07.833
- Chopper, this is my fiance,
Devon.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.184
- The oncologist office
in Winnipeg called.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.837
They said you missed
your appointment?

00:11.881 --> 00:14.492
- I've been trying to make
this pie my whole life.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.233
It's never gonna taste like
how my mom made it.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.801
- You're Jolene's son.
You look just like her.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.846
- Sorry, I guess I have
a familiar face.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.066
My dad was Jamaican.
My mom was from Deep Lake.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.459
That's all I know about
my birth parents.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.069
- Look, I think it's best
if we just

00:26.113 --> 00:27.462
keep things professional
between us.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.340
[chainsaw whirring]

00:43.565 --> 00:44.696
[tree cracking]

00:45.349 --> 00:48.004
- Get out of the way!
Move, move, move!

00:51.268 --> 00:52.530
[indistinct shouting]

00:52.574 --> 00:54.097
Everybody okay?

00:54.141 --> 00:57.361
[girl]: Help! I need help!
My brother needs a doctor!

00:58.232 --> 01:00.886
- We don't know who
she is or where she came from.

01:00.930 --> 01:04.934
The only thing she'll tell us is
that her brother needs a doctor.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.634
- Hi, I'm Crystal.
This is Hayley.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.419
We're here to help.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.595
Can you tell me your name?

01:14.465 --> 01:15.553
- Ava.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.381
- Do you like hot chocolate,
Ava?

01:17.425 --> 01:19.253
I keep an emergency stash
in my flight bag.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.472
And I see a kettle over there.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.606
[distant chainsaw whirring]

01:24.649 --> 01:27.565
- We heard you're worried about
your brother. Is he sick?

01:28.697 --> 01:31.439
Is your mom or dad with him?
- My mom's out hunting.

01:32.004 --> 01:34.137
I just want Dustin to be okay.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.791
- Is Dustin your brother?

01:36.313 --> 01:39.055
- He's at home.
- Do you know your address?

01:40.709 --> 01:42.102
- We don't have one.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.366
[tense music]

01:56.594 --> 01:58.030
- Do you two live alone?

01:58.074 --> 01:59.902
- Yeah, ever since my dad died.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.947
[boy coughing]

02:03.253 --> 02:05.168
- Hi, Dustin.
We're here to help.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.170
Can you tell me where it hurts?

02:07.214 --> 02:10.826
- My leg. I cut it
a couple days ago.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.307
- He's been vomiting, I'll start
an IV for dehydration.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.918
- Please, it hurts so much.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.530
- HR's high.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.055
This is too small to cause
so much pain.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.710
[shouting]

02:25.754 --> 02:28.974
He's got crepitus.
Gas bubbles under the skin.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.324
It indicates
necrotizing fasciitis.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.413
- We need to get him
to a hospital.

02:32.456 --> 02:36.634
- Hey! Hey, who the hell are
you?! Get away from my son!

02:36.678 --> 02:38.549
- We're nurses,
we're here to help.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.203
- How did you get here?

02:40.247 --> 02:41.857
- I'm sorry, Mom.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.425
- Ava did the right thing.
Dustin is very sick.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.167
- Oh, it's okay, honey.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.733
I know you were scared,
but I'm home now.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.041
You can go.
I'll take it from here.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.652
- No, I don't think
you understand, he needs
a hospital.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.132
- He'll be just fine with me.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.786
- Can't you see how sick he is?

02:57.829 --> 03:01.790
This isn't a normal infection.
This is flesh-eating disease.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.140
- I-I can take care
of him here.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.620
- No, you can't.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.883
Do you know what the mortality
rate is for this?

03:07.926 --> 03:10.668
It's almost 50 %.
So best case scenario,

03:10.712 --> 03:13.802
we get him to a hospital
and he only loses his leg.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.369
[tense music]

03:15.412 --> 03:16.761
- Mom?

03:18.023 --> 03:19.938
- Tapwe Na?

03:19.982 --> 03:22.027
You need antibiotics
and surgery.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.333
But if you're over 16,

03:23.377 --> 03:25.205
you don't need her permission
to come with us.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.772
- No, no, Dustin, don't.

03:27.816 --> 03:30.166
- It's your call, Dustin.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.782
- I'll... I'll go with you.

03:45.050 --> 03:49.446
- Okay, Dustin, let's go.
- Wait. I-I'm coming too.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.666
- Okay.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.200
Are you okay?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.158
[breathing heavily]

04:07.377 --> 04:09.249
- My husband, Danny.
He...

04:10.075 --> 04:14.254
A hospital down south gave him
antibiotics for pneumonia,

04:14.297 --> 04:17.082
but his throat closed,
and he...

04:17.126 --> 04:18.780
- He had an anaphylactic
reaction?

04:18.823 --> 04:21.478
- No one would tell me anything.

04:21.522 --> 04:24.089
When it was happening, no one
would answer my questions.

04:24.786 --> 04:28.224
- I'm sorry.
That shouldn't have happened.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.055
Listen, I duty out after
this call.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.231
I was going to stay for a bit,

04:35.275 --> 04:37.407
maybe catch up on some
paperwork.

04:38.408 --> 04:39.844
If you want the company...

04:41.759 --> 04:43.935
[soft music]

04:48.810 --> 04:51.813
- Is it almost time for another
hot chocolate?

04:51.856 --> 04:54.206
- It was like this when my dad
was sick.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.477
- Do you know why I keep
this in my bag?

05:04.478 --> 05:06.480
It's because my mom always
said that

05:06.523 --> 05:08.743
there's nothing
that it can't fix.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.484
She was a nurse too.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.226
Just because something bad has
happened before,

05:14.270 --> 05:16.490
doesn't mean it's gonna happen
again, okay?

05:18.143 --> 05:19.231
- Marie?

05:20.929 --> 05:23.975
The surgeons managed to debride
a lot of dead tissue.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.369
Dustin will need a prolonged
course of antibiotics,

05:26.413 --> 05:27.805
but it's looking good.

05:27.849 --> 05:28.893
- His leg?

05:28.937 --> 05:31.113
- He's going to need a lot
of rehab,

05:31.156 --> 05:32.375
but we got him in time.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.898
[gasps]

05:34.377 --> 05:35.944
You can go see him in Recovery.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.688
- Thank you.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.344
[laughing]

05:48.435 --> 05:49.784
- You dutied out, huh?

05:50.785 --> 05:52.830
- She had a bad experience.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.833
She's skittish about hospitals,
so I thought it would help.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.923
- You know, there's a real gooey
centre under that hard shell,

05:58.967 --> 06:00.795
Crystal Highway.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.406
And you just helped me
knock "Doomsday Prepper" off
my Patient Bingo.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.712
[laughing]

06:04.755 --> 06:06.278
Take you for a crummy
midnight snack

06:06.322 --> 06:07.541
at the cafeteria
to celebrate?

06:07.584 --> 06:09.456
- Sure.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.935
[sighs]

06:10.979 --> 06:12.763
- What do you call a snack this
far after midnight?

06:13.982 --> 06:16.898
- Breakfast at your place.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.335
- Yes, ma'am.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.035
[bird cooing]

06:26.342 --> 06:28.649
- Ah, dibs on the shower.

06:28.692 --> 06:29.998
- What smells amazing?!

06:31.216 --> 06:32.522
- Reach again,
you lose the hand.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.306
- C'mon man, just one before
I go on duty?

06:35.264 --> 06:37.397
- Are those raspberry pancakes?
Those are your favourite.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.748
- Really? It's Thompson,
so the raspberries are frozen.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.929
[whispering]: Did you know?

06:51.193 --> 06:55.197
- Hey, if he's happy,
I'm happy.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.547
But if anyone were to make
him unhappy,

06:57.591 --> 06:59.027
they'd answer to "Ronda"
and "Rousey".

06:59.070 --> 07:00.245
- Okay, message received.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.117
Hey! Don't think I didn't
see that, flyboy!

07:02.160 --> 07:03.684
[grunting]

07:04.424 --> 07:06.295
- I'm sorry.
- It's cool.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.819
Oh, you work out!

07:08.863 --> 07:09.951
- Nichelle?

07:09.994 --> 07:12.475
- Lexi! Surprise!

07:12.519 --> 07:14.303
[chuckling]
I'm on a reading week.

07:14.346 --> 07:17.698
- Not that I'm not excited
to see you,

07:17.741 --> 07:19.439
and I want to hear
all about school,

07:19.482 --> 07:21.484
and this fabulousness,

07:21.528 --> 07:25.053
but I was up all night, and
I'm pretty sure there's barf
on my flight suit, so...

07:25.096 --> 07:27.403
- Go, it's cool.
I can make myself comfortable.

07:28.099 --> 07:30.754
I'm Lexi's sister, Nichelle.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.148
- Hi, um, I'm sorry.
I'm Chopper.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.498
Nice to meet you, Nichelle.
- You too, biceps.

07:35.542 --> 07:39.154
- Okay, not that comfortable,
Nichelle. Bye, Chopper!

07:39.197 --> 07:40.460
- Bye.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.811
[door opening]

07:44.551 --> 07:46.335
- Leaving the gym, Mads.
Be home in five.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.293
- We're gonna have to soak
the hides

07:48.337 --> 07:50.208
after you get everything set up.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.167
Make sure that jug is full
of water, eh?

07:54.996 --> 07:57.302
Hey. Bodie, right?
I knew your mom, Jolene.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.870
Hey, we're making a drum.
You wanna join?

08:01.350 --> 08:03.613
[indistinct chattering]

08:04.396 --> 08:05.659
[door opening]

08:06.921 --> 08:08.531
[chuckling]

08:08.575 --> 08:11.403
- Babe! Can you believe all
this great stuff my mom got us?

08:11.447 --> 08:14.232
- Oh, it's just a couple
of essentials for the little
tadpole.

08:14.276 --> 08:18.802
- Wow. Thanks, Mrs. Van Camp.
That's so... generous.

08:18.846 --> 08:22.240
- Austen, you're about to be
family. You call me Missy.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.939
- I was just telling Mom
my fun idea.

08:24.982 --> 08:28.246
The next ultrasound
is the big one, we find out
the baby's sex!

08:28.290 --> 08:30.901
- Mm-hmm.
- So, we'll get the results
in an envelope,

08:30.945 --> 08:32.773
and a baker will make reveal
cupcakes!

08:32.816 --> 08:34.078
I'll bring them to the hangar,

08:34.122 --> 08:35.602
and you can find out with
all your friends.

08:36.341 --> 08:40.650
- Now, sweet heart, I have one
more surprise for you here.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.304
[gasps]

08:42.347 --> 08:45.786
Austen, this is the blanket that
I was brought home in

08:45.829 --> 08:47.788
and that Maddy was brought
home in.

08:47.831 --> 08:50.181
And now your baby will be too.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.748
- Thanks, Mom.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.577
- Are there any African or Cree
traditions?

08:54.621 --> 08:58.276
You just have so much culture
to share with your baby.

08:58.320 --> 09:02.150
- Uh, right. I have to think
about that.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.631
I have a schedevac, so, I...
I gotta go.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.023
- I'll make you some tea.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.853
- Babe, wait.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.640
I told her you were adopted,
she must have forgot.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.076
[sighs]

09:15.685 --> 09:18.993
Uh, maybe your adopted parents
have some traditions?

09:19.036 --> 09:20.777
- Yeah, I don't know.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.388
- You still haven't said
if they're gonna be here for
the birth, or...

09:26.217 --> 09:29.960
- Yeah, I'll, um...
I'll ask them.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.530
[soft music]

09:34.574 --> 09:35.966
[door opening]

09:37.577 --> 09:38.839
[technician over speaker]: Glad
you finally made it in

09:38.882 --> 09:40.623
for the pre-screening, Hayley.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.538
[Hayley]: Yeah,
I've been working a lot.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.975
[soft music]

09:59.642 --> 10:01.252
[whirring]

10:01.296 --> 10:03.298
[breathing deeply]

10:11.132 --> 10:13.656
- You're doing great, I just
need you to hold still.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.440
- Right, yeah, I'm sorry.

10:15.484 --> 10:16.920
Sorry if, um...

10:17.834 --> 10:19.401
I've been around...

10:20.620 --> 10:23.971
I've been around MRIs before,
I've just never been in one.

10:24.536 --> 10:27.583
- A few more minutes, I'll come
in and inject the gadolinium.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.412
That's the dye, so your
oncologist can see better.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.543
[breathing deeply]

10:31.587 --> 10:33.850
- Stop! I need to stop.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.984
[machine beeping]

10:37.941 --> 10:40.161
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I can't.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.424
[door opening]

10:46.297 --> 10:47.995
- Hey, Hayley.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.867
This is what you were doing
in Winnipeg?

10:50.911 --> 10:53.217
- Uh-huh, yeah. I, uh...
[chuckling]

10:53.261 --> 10:55.045
I always wanted a fancy
coffee maker,

10:55.089 --> 10:57.178
and flight nurses make bank,

10:57.221 --> 11:01.704
so I figured why wait, you know?
Why not live it up now?

11:01.748 --> 11:04.054
I-I know you drink tea,

11:04.098 --> 11:05.752
but do you want a fancy
cappuccino?

11:07.971 --> 11:11.105
- Are you... good?

11:11.148 --> 11:13.585
- Yeah, I'm great.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.375
- Show it off if you got it,
girl.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.333
If you like the green dress,
wear it.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.770
It's your engagement party.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.162
- Whose engagement party?

11:25.206 --> 11:28.252
- Um, this is Sharon,
a 45-year-old woman

11:28.296 --> 11:29.601
with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.212
- Crystal knows
this stuff already.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.083
But this one's missing a pulse.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.172
She's afraid to wear what
she wants to her own engagement
party.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.826
- Engagement party?

11:36.870 --> 11:38.828
- Yeah. Me and Devon
are doing a joint event.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.177
I fly home tomorrow.

11:40.221 --> 11:43.441
- Whoa, whoa, instead
of a bachelorette party?

11:44.094 --> 11:45.617
Emma, you only live once.

11:45.661 --> 11:46.967
You can't miss out on
this stuff.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.272
[speaking Nêhiyawwin]

11:48.316 --> 11:50.144
- Can you get the IV swapped
over?

11:50.187 --> 11:51.188
- Yeah.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.586
- You haven't told him?

11:57.629 --> 12:00.850
About Chopper?
About you and Chopper?

12:00.894 --> 12:02.547
- I'm waiting for the right
time.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.246
- And you think your engagement
party is the right time?

12:06.769 --> 12:08.510
- I love Devon, okay?

12:08.553 --> 12:11.165
We're meant to be together.
We're soulmates.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.821
- Emma, we just had
a great idea.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.693
I'm hosting you a bachelorette
party in Thompson, tonight!

12:17.737 --> 12:19.521
- I don't think
that's a great idea.

12:19.564 --> 12:22.393
- I... love it.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.134
- Yay!

12:24.178 --> 12:26.397
[Crystal]: We need to keep
this low-key.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.138
- No, low-key is the problem.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.271
We're young, we have to start
having a lot more fun

12:30.314 --> 12:31.663
while we can.
Even you, Crystal.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.362
Hey, would you rather have
a fun bachelorette party

12:34.405 --> 12:36.407
or a low-key one?
- Fun.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.801
We went to the planetarium
for mine.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.063
It was great, but...

12:40.107 --> 12:41.717
I mean, when else do you get
to go all-out?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.153
- Who's having a bachelor party?

12:43.197 --> 12:45.460
- Emma. I'm throwing her
one tonight.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.333
- I should start
the pre-flights.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.905
[door opening and closing]

12:57.080 --> 12:58.429
- Hey!

12:58.473 --> 13:00.344
- Why are you looking
at flights to New Orleans?

13:00.388 --> 13:01.781
Don't classes start soon?

13:03.826 --> 13:05.741
- Lex, I'm taking the rest
of the year off.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.743
- But it's your last year
of poli-sci.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.963
I thought it was your dream
to apply to law school.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.314
- Being a lawyer isn't for me.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.055
- How do you know that?
- Because the thought of

13:15.098 --> 13:16.839
spending two more years in
school plus articling,

13:16.883 --> 13:18.449
it makes me want to throw up!

13:19.146 --> 13:22.889
Look, I'm just gonna take
some time off.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.673
You know, do some travelling,
and figure out

13:24.716 --> 13:26.022
what I really want to do.

13:26.588 --> 13:27.807
- What did Mom and Dad say?

13:28.764 --> 13:31.811
Oh! You're here because you want
me to tell them.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.464
- Well,
you're the responsible one.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.423
- Are you kidding me, Shell?

13:35.466 --> 13:37.294
- If you say it's the right
thing to do,

13:37.338 --> 13:39.862
they're gonna believe you.
- I don't think it's the right
thing to do!

13:39.906 --> 13:42.386
You finally started getting
back on track. You want to throw
that away?

13:42.430 --> 13:44.693
- It's not that big of a big
deal, Lex.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.826
[door opening]

13:47.652 --> 13:49.263
- You made a hashtag?

13:49.306 --> 13:50.481
- Yeah.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.919
- Ooh! A bachelorette?

13:52.962 --> 13:54.181
[chuckling]
- Yeah.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.792
- Okay, who's getting married?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.750
- One of the other nurses.
- Okay.

13:58.794 --> 14:01.188
- If you guys aren't doing
anything tonight, you should
totally come.

14:01.231 --> 14:05.148
- Uh, that's cool. We were just
gonna have a quiet night in.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.846
- We'd love to!

14:08.804 --> 14:10.980
[indistinct chattering]

14:14.679 --> 14:16.029
What do you think?

14:16.072 --> 14:18.596
- Wow, it's very...

14:19.597 --> 14:21.556
Emma and Devon forever.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.560
Right, I, uh, I think
I left my pager in there.

14:28.693 --> 14:33.873
- Okay, do we think regular
straws or penis straws?

14:35.570 --> 14:39.139
- Hey! Hey, you!

14:41.619 --> 14:45.362
[suspenseful music]
Hey! Stop!

14:45.885 --> 14:49.932
[laughing]
- Suck it, corporate pig!

14:49.976 --> 14:51.238
Whoa!

14:52.892 --> 14:55.372
You know how hard it is to be
a street artist in Windy Lake?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.679
- Not a lot of streets.

14:57.722 --> 15:00.638
- You know, we have picked
you up three times in the last
six months.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.510
What, do you have some kind of
death wish or something?

15:02.553 --> 15:04.468
- I'm an artist.
I need to paint.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.557
How long until I can hold
a can again?

15:06.601 --> 15:09.386
- You're flying to Winnipeg
for orthopedic surgery.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.649
Gonna be a while.
- I picked you up

15:11.693 --> 15:13.869
when you broke three ribs
falling off the perimeter
bridge,

15:13.913 --> 15:16.698
and then again when you got
attacked by that security dog.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.134
When are you going to learn?

15:18.178 --> 15:21.137
This hobby of yours doesn't love
you back, dude. Move on.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.052
- That's harsh, bro.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.968
- Yeah. Chopper's not
so chipper today.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.665
Have you considered canvas?

15:32.105 --> 15:34.063
- It's Emma's bachelorette
tonight.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.717
They're all at the crew house.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.024
- Madison's at her mom's
tonight.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.417
You wanna come over, play some
Call of Duty? Some bro time?

15:40.461 --> 15:42.854
- No, it's just,
I need to get over this.

15:42.898 --> 15:46.771
- The best way to get over
someone is to get under someone.

15:53.039 --> 15:56.129
[upbeat party music]

15:56.172 --> 15:57.957
- The bride has arrived!

15:58.000 --> 15:58.870
[excited squealing]

16:02.526 --> 16:04.398
- I'm gonna go get a mop ready.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.270
[all]: Cheers!

16:07.314 --> 16:09.055
[laughing]

16:09.098 --> 16:09.969
- Ooh!

16:11.405 --> 16:13.102
[grunting]

16:14.060 --> 16:17.846
- Okay! Is everyone ready
to play...

16:19.369 --> 16:21.632
the fiance quiz?!

16:21.676 --> 16:23.199
- Woo!

16:23.243 --> 16:24.853
- Okay, I had Devon prerecord
some answers,

16:24.896 --> 16:27.943
and for every answer you get
wrong, you have to drink, okay?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.423
- Okay!
- Question number one,

16:29.466 --> 16:31.207
where did you meet?

16:31.251 --> 16:32.992
- 11th grade bio.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.951
He had Robert Pattinson hair
and wanted to be a doctor.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.736
- Grade 11 bio.
She liked my hair.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.434
- Hey, yes!
- Yes!

16:40.477 --> 16:42.088
Okay, what is Devon's favourite
movie?

16:42.131 --> 16:44.655
- Wall-E.
- Wall-E!

16:44.699 --> 16:46.614
- Aww!
- Pizza order?

16:46.657 --> 16:49.095
- A slice of meat lovers...
- And a Sprite.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.880
- Celebrity crush.
- Uh, Ariana Grande.

16:51.923 --> 16:55.057
- Yes! Okay, Devon's turn.

16:55.101 --> 16:58.974
Dear Emma, who is your favourite
musical artist?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.890
- Mmm, The Paper Machetes.
- Mm-hmm.

17:01.933 --> 17:02.891
- I'm obsessed.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.719
- Oh, The Weeknd!

17:04.762 --> 17:07.113
And guess who has tickets
to see him when you get home?

17:07.156 --> 17:09.854
- Um, I only started listening
to The Machetes

17:09.898 --> 17:12.466
when I came up here.
Devon wouldn't know that.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.033
[Hayley]: Favourite movie?

17:14.076 --> 17:16.426
- La La Land.
- Crazy, Stupid, Love.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.862
- Oh...

17:17.906 --> 17:19.255
Favourite colour?

17:19.299 --> 17:20.735
- Pink.
- Green.

17:20.778 --> 17:24.304
- Favourite meal.
- Oh, mushroom risotto.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.263
- Sports team?
- The Blue Jays.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.743
- What?
- Mm-mm!

17:28.786 --> 17:30.832
- Biggest fear.
- Snakes.

17:35.402 --> 17:39.362
- Okay, um... more shots.
More shots? Yeah, more shots!

17:39.406 --> 17:41.234
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- More shots.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.195
- Emma, come on.
What are you doing here?

17:47.762 --> 17:52.158
- Please, Crys. I just need not
to think tonight, okay?

17:53.028 --> 17:56.205
- Okay. If you're gonna get
wrecked, do it right.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.554
Come on!

17:57.598 --> 17:59.643
- Here we go, here we go!

18:01.689 --> 18:03.256
[all]: Cheers!

18:03.299 --> 18:04.996
- Yeah!
- Woo!

18:05.040 --> 18:06.476
- Yeah, let's get it in!

18:07.695 --> 18:09.958
- We were at a bar once and
she lost her wallet.

18:10.001 --> 18:13.570
So she talks to the manager
and says she's gonna dance
off her tab.

18:13.614 --> 18:17.139
So she gets on the bar,
Coyote Uglys it...

18:17.183 --> 18:18.575
[laughing]
Meow!

18:18.619 --> 18:22.188
...and ends up making $200.

18:22.231 --> 18:26.105
- I was wearing clothes.
And this was years ago.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.759
[laughing]

18:28.803 --> 18:29.978
[indistinct chattering]

18:30.021 --> 18:31.414
- It's my song, let's go!

18:31.458 --> 18:34.243
- Woo! Oh!

18:34.287 --> 18:35.810
Oh, excuse me.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.594
[women cheering]

18:37.638 --> 18:39.379
- Why would you tell them that?

18:39.422 --> 18:40.945
I have to work with these women.

18:41.511 --> 18:44.340
[excited squealing]
- Does it look like they care?

18:44.384 --> 18:46.951
- These women aren't trying to
make captain, Nichelle.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.954
I am. Do you know what it takes
to go captain?

18:49.998 --> 18:51.913
A perfect reputation.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.176
I have to get all the pilots
and all of these nurses

18:54.220 --> 18:56.396
that talk to them to say
I'm a solid bet.

18:56.439 --> 18:59.964
All it takes, especially
for a woman of colour, is...

19:00.008 --> 19:02.358
is one bad rumour, okay?

19:02.402 --> 19:04.273
One bad night out and I'm over.

19:05.274 --> 19:08.234
You may not think
it's a big deal to drop out

19:08.277 --> 19:09.626
and screw up your dreams,

19:09.670 --> 19:11.802
but I'm not going
to screw up mine.

19:13.630 --> 19:17.112
[upbeat music playing]

19:21.595 --> 19:23.597
[women laughing]

19:36.349 --> 19:38.351
[phone ringing]

19:38.699 --> 19:41.528
- Austen, what a nice surprise!

19:41.571 --> 19:44.183
- Hey, yeah, I wanted to tell
you something.

19:46.054 --> 19:47.969
[sighs]
Madison and I are having a baby.

19:50.406 --> 19:53.061
Did the screen freeze, or...?

19:53.104 --> 19:55.237
- No, we heard you.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.413
- Is this, uh...

19:58.284 --> 20:00.677
a done deal?
- Jesus, Dad.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.549
- You have your whole life
ahead of you.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.377
A baby's a lot
of responsibility.

20:04.420 --> 20:08.511
- I-I know. But this is my
child and I'm not...

20:08.555 --> 20:10.209
I'm not walking away from it.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.949
- What about Madison?

20:12.863 --> 20:14.256
- We got a place together.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.258
- Are you going to marry her?

20:16.302 --> 20:18.695
[soft music]

20:18.739 --> 20:21.698
Austen, committing to this child

20:21.742 --> 20:25.006
also means committing to her,
for better or worse.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.324
- Well, you're home early.
[chuckling nervously]

20:38.367 --> 20:41.065
- Uh, bachelorettes aren't
really my scene.

20:41.109 --> 20:44.330
I'll bet your evening
was way more exciting.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.332
[chuckling]
- Nah.

20:47.463 --> 20:50.988
We did do a prisoner transport,
though.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.381
- Wow. For real?

20:52.425 --> 20:55.254
- He'll probably be charged
with trespassing.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.300
And, uh, vandalism.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.910
You know what? I...

20:59.954 --> 21:03.740
I don't want to say
that I'm the hero, but uh...

21:03.784 --> 21:05.481
His street art
was pretty terrible.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.527
[laughing]

21:07.570 --> 21:12.445
- So what are your plans for
the rest of the evening, hero?

21:13.837 --> 21:15.404
You flying solo?

21:15.448 --> 21:18.538
- Oh, we always fly two crew
on mede... vac.

21:19.974 --> 21:21.845
Oh...

21:21.889 --> 21:24.457
[laughing]

21:27.590 --> 21:30.637
I don't do this much.
The one-time thing.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.769
- It's not a prerequisite.

21:34.467 --> 21:38.819
- Awesome. Awesome, 'cause
I am down with a no-strings
night if you are.

21:38.862 --> 21:40.690
- Yep.

21:42.562 --> 21:46.566
- Great. That's great.
Great that things are clear.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.611
'Cause the last time I hooked
up, things weren't so clear

21:48.655 --> 21:49.786
and it got messy,

21:49.830 --> 21:51.614
and you know,
she was in a thing,

21:51.658 --> 21:53.834
and maybe there were
expectations that I didn't know
that I was...

21:54.400 --> 21:56.097
- Do you want to talk about it?

21:56.140 --> 21:57.968
- Uh, nope.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.623
The thing is,
she kissed me first.

22:00.667 --> 22:01.494
- Okay.

22:01.537 --> 22:02.843
[laughing]

22:03.844 --> 22:06.281
- Shh! You'll wake people up.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.588
- You're not as stealthy
as you think.

22:08.631 --> 22:11.242
And you should definitely
drink some water.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.766
Maybe eat something before
you go to sleep.

22:12.809 --> 22:16.378
- Oh, my God, I'm so hungry.
Guys, we should make food.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.162
[laughing]

22:18.206 --> 22:20.469
Pancakes!
- No, no, no! Eggs!

22:20.513 --> 22:22.428
- No, eggs and pancakes!

22:22.471 --> 22:25.300
- This is a "you" problem now.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.477
[Hayley]: Ooh, pancake mix.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.784
[laughing]
Spatula!

22:32.438 --> 22:34.527
- Hey, is everything
okay out here?

22:39.270 --> 22:40.837
- I have to barf.

22:43.013 --> 22:45.146
- Seriously? You slept
with my coworker?

22:45.189 --> 22:46.756
- No, nothing happened.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.758
- After I asked you not to,
after everything that I said?

22:48.802 --> 22:50.151
- Lexi, we were just talking.

22:52.153 --> 22:55.461
- Oh, wow. So you're gonna
believe him but not me.

22:56.723 --> 22:59.856
You know what?
I'm gonna go to a hotel

23:00.770 --> 23:02.293
since you're so embarrassed
to have me here.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.948
- I'm sorry, it's just...

23:05.471 --> 23:08.996
- What? I'm the screw-up?
Is that what you were gonna say?

23:09.039 --> 23:12.347
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
Lexi, but we can't all be you!

23:12.391 --> 23:14.784
- What does that mean?
[scoffs]

23:14.828 --> 23:16.220
- The overachiever.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.788
The one following in Dad's
footsteps.

23:19.572 --> 23:23.663
The pilot our parents
are so proud of.

23:23.706 --> 23:26.666
[scoffs]
- Oh, you've got to be joking!

23:26.709 --> 23:28.407
[gasping]

23:30.887 --> 23:31.888
Nichelle?

23:31.932 --> 23:33.107
[tense music]

23:33.150 --> 23:34.195
Nichelle!

23:40.984 --> 23:42.682
- No pulse, apnic.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.727
- She has a congenital heart
condition.

23:44.771 --> 23:47.034
- Starting CPR.
- She had an ICD put in
five years ago,

23:47.077 --> 23:48.427
something must be wrong.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.429
- Yeah, we need an ambulance
at 102 Pine Street.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.475
- Starting oxygen.
- Placing pads.

23:53.519 --> 23:57.087
[computerized voice]:
Analyzing now. Shock advised.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.828
- Alright, everybody clear.

23:58.872 --> 23:59.873
[defibrillator whirring]

23:59.916 --> 24:01.135
[beeping]

24:03.529 --> 24:05.444
[Lexi]: What's happening,
is she okay?

24:05.487 --> 24:07.271
[Tristan]: No pulse.

24:07.315 --> 24:11.275
[computerized voice]:
Analyzing now. Shock advised.

24:11.319 --> 24:12.494
[defibrillator whirring]
- Clear!

24:12.538 --> 24:13.669
[beeping]

24:17.499 --> 24:19.588
- Looks like a lead failure.

24:19.632 --> 24:22.156
The EP lab will confirm her ICD
malfunctioned,

24:22.199 --> 24:24.593
but she's gonna need to go to
Winnipeg for emergency surgery

24:24.637 --> 24:26.247
to get it replaced.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.944
- Bodie, Chopper, and Tristan
are here,

24:27.988 --> 24:29.946
standing by to fly her to YWG.

24:29.990 --> 24:32.688
- They came down?
- We take care of our own, Lexi.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.169
[medical machines beeping]

24:35.604 --> 24:38.172
- I need to call Winnipeg first
to make sure

24:38.215 --> 24:39.826
there's a cardiologist available
to receive her.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.262
[indistinct chattering]

24:41.305 --> 24:42.829
- Hey, Trev.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.182
What are her chances?

24:48.225 --> 24:50.619
- She needs a replacement
device, fast.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.536
My buddy is the best
cardiologist in Winnipeg.

24:54.580 --> 24:58.148
He's on vacation at his cottage,
but I'll see what I can do.

24:58.845 --> 24:59.933
- You'd do that?

24:59.976 --> 25:01.282
- Crys...

25:01.891 --> 25:04.590
You're always taking care of
everyone else.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.896
Why are you so surprised
when someone tries to take
care of you?

25:06.940 --> 25:08.855
[distant phone ringing]

25:14.251 --> 25:15.775
- How you holding up?

25:17.777 --> 25:20.040
- She hasn't been sick in such
a long time.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.869
I forgot she could be
so fragile.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.220
- She'll be okay, Lex.

25:26.263 --> 25:29.223
- I used to get so annoyed
at her.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.706
When we were kids,
whenever she got sick,

25:33.749 --> 25:35.185
my parents would ship me off
to cadets

25:35.229 --> 25:36.970
so they wouldn't have
to deal with me at the hospital.

25:37.013 --> 25:40.060
- You were there more than
I was. And I was there a lot.

25:42.323 --> 25:45.631
- She got her whole childhood
with our parents.

25:46.980 --> 25:50.461
The only quality time I ever got
was flying with my dad.

25:51.419 --> 25:54.683
And now she's jealous because
our parents are proud of me?

25:54.727 --> 25:56.424
- You are lucky, Lex.

25:57.381 --> 26:00.471
You had a big dream,
and your parents supported it.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.389
- Yours still giving you
a hard time?

26:05.433 --> 26:06.695
[scoffs]

26:07.391 --> 26:09.916
- I still get letters
from my dziadek

26:09.959 --> 26:11.744
telling me I'm shaming
the family.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.529
- I'll be proud of you for them,
then.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.099
[footsteps approaching]

26:20.274 --> 26:21.841
- Trevor got his buddy
out of bed.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.495
He's driving back to the city
now, he'll meet you in Winnipeg.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.591
[phone beeping]

26:42.383 --> 26:43.906
[gate opening]

26:43.950 --> 26:46.213
[birds chirping]

26:48.258 --> 26:49.520
- Is Nichelle okay?

26:49.564 --> 26:52.828
- She's having her ICD replaced.
Lexi's with her.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.008
- Alright. I'm on the clock
in 30 minutes.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.445
I gotta get some coffee in me.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.406
- Kill me. Kill me now.

27:05.449 --> 27:06.886
[door opening and closing]

27:06.929 --> 27:09.715
- You, my dear,
need to rehydrate.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.760
[birds chirping]

27:12.805 --> 27:15.068
You should probably
eat something, too.

27:15.111 --> 27:19.028
- Ugh, my stomach muscles still
hurt from last night's yak fest.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.076
- Aspirin.
- Thank you.

27:23.119 --> 27:24.817
- Green tea.
- Thanks.

27:26.993 --> 27:30.257
- I know you had doubts,
Crys, but she's pretty awesome.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.476
[door opening]
- Shh. Don't tell her that.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.652
[door closing]

27:33.695 --> 27:35.175
Doesn't hurt to keep her
working for it.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.659
Are we gonna talk about how
you have the hots for Chopper?

27:40.702 --> 27:42.965
Or that you really
don't want to marry Devon?

27:44.140 --> 27:45.533
- I do.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.102
About Devon, I mean.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.974
[soft music]

27:52.018 --> 27:54.455
We've been together
since we were in high school.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.022
That has to mean something,
doesn't it?

27:56.065 --> 27:59.112
- I don't know. If I'd married
my high school sweetheart,

27:59.155 --> 28:00.809
it'd be a disaster.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.593
- We had a plan.

28:03.116 --> 28:05.640
He was going to be a doctor,
I was going to be a nurse.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.816
We were going to have
two kids in Toronto.

28:07.860 --> 28:10.036
[sighs]
There was a plan.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.691
- It's okay to grow up, Em.

28:13.822 --> 28:16.912
To grow out of things.
And people.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.569
- Like an angel. You'd weep.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.745
Best singing voice
you ever heard.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.835
Everyone in Windy Lake
assumed he'd go pro,

28:26.879 --> 28:30.143
but he wanted to stay here and
look after the family business.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.276
- Well, you must be the angel.

28:33.320 --> 28:36.845
- Not yet, I hope.
I got three kids under five.

28:36.889 --> 28:40.849
- This is Carl, he's a
45-year-old man with pharyngeal
cancer.

28:40.893 --> 28:44.157
He had surgery three weeks ago
to remove a cancerous tumour.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.986
And recovery was
progressing as normal,

28:47.029 --> 28:49.771
until he started experiencing
a persistent pain

28:49.815 --> 28:51.512
on the side of his throat.

28:51.555 --> 28:55.124
So I'm sending him to an ENT
to get it looked at.

28:55.734 --> 28:59.389
- Well, we will get you
sorted out and back to those
kids in no time.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.130
- Don't rush too fast.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.523
[chuckling]

29:06.309 --> 29:08.137
It aches something terrible.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.530
[Hayley]: Around your sutures?

29:09.573 --> 29:11.314
We're halfway to Thompson.
Let me take a look.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.839
[machines beeping rapidly]

29:14.535 --> 29:15.623
[grunting]

29:16.798 --> 29:18.844
[breathing heavily]

29:21.063 --> 29:23.239
Get on the radio with Thompson
and tell them

29:23.283 --> 29:25.546
there's a 45-year-old patient
with a carotid bleed,

29:25.589 --> 29:28.157
he needs emergency blood
immediately and surgery.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.290
[tense music]

29:30.333 --> 29:33.554
- Winnipeg Centre,
this is SkyMed 911 Medevac
requesting priority.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.338
- It's going to be okay, Carl.
Stay with me, alright?

29:35.382 --> 29:37.210
Hey, I need another
set of hands here.

29:37.253 --> 29:38.385
- I'm going back.
You have control.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.734
- I have control.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.649
- Stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.

29:41.692 --> 29:42.955
- What do you need?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.740
- Listen to me.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.395
I can't take pressure off
his carotid or he'll bleed out
in seconds.

29:48.438 --> 29:51.267
But if I apply too much
pressure, he could have a
stroke.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.226
- How long can you keep that up?

29:53.269 --> 29:55.271
- He's lost a lot of blood.
I need you...

29:55.315 --> 29:56.751
I need you to keep
his fluids up.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.927
- Me? I'm not a nurse.

29:58.971 --> 30:01.190
- Just do exactly what I say,
okay?

30:01.234 --> 30:04.150
Stay with me, Carl. You're okay,
we got you. Okay, put gloves on.

30:05.499 --> 30:08.241
You see that bag of saline
on the pump?

30:08.284 --> 30:11.244
We need to get it in him.
Okay, let me know when you're
ready.

30:12.114 --> 30:15.944
Okay, take the bag off
of the pump. I'm gonna put
a pressure bag on it.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.512
It's in that drawer,
looks sort of like a BP cuff.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.166
[Hayley breathing heavily]

30:20.209 --> 30:21.689
- This?

30:21.732 --> 30:24.910
- Okay, once it's on, make sure
the line's unclamped,

30:24.953 --> 30:26.999
and start pumping, okay?

30:27.042 --> 30:29.958
Stay with me. You're okay.
Okay, look at me, you're okay.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.440
- Okay, I got it.

30:35.572 --> 30:36.965
Done. What's next?

30:37.009 --> 30:39.446
- Just keep refilling.
There's extra bags in my bag.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.406
And we can clean the blood
off the patient.

34:41.644 --> 34:42.993
To me...

34:44.734 --> 34:46.780
you'll always be a hero.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.481
M-Madison, I...

35:35.524 --> 35:37.178
- Oh, my God.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.180
I'm so sorry.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.625
- I can't believe you!

35:49.930 --> 35:54.282
I gave you everything!
My love, my trust!

35:56.284 --> 35:57.503
[sighs]

36:00.549 --> 36:02.986
I don't know why it took me
so long to see.

36:04.553 --> 36:08.253
You were never going to be able
to give me any of that back.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.170
You don't know how, Bodie.

36:18.611 --> 36:22.745
[soft music]

36:49.946 --> 36:52.819
- I knew you were in
a rush to get out of Thompson,

36:52.862 --> 36:55.996
but getting a medevac out?

36:57.606 --> 37:00.261
I could've hooked you up
with one of my flight passes,
at least.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.307
[laughing]
- Ow, ow.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.091
- You got a new ICD.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.268
Your heart's ready to rock.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.229
- Wow.

37:11.272 --> 37:15.233
I think I'll go easier
at the next bachelorette.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.756
[laughing]

37:17.409 --> 37:20.586
- I'm sorry
I was so hard on you.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.894
I put a lot of pressure
on myself.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.332
Sometimes,
it gets the best of me.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.465
- Get in here, Cadet Martine.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.467
[chuckling]

37:36.123 --> 37:37.951
[sighing]

37:39.257 --> 37:44.087
I'm sorry I asked you
to do my dirty work with Mom
and Dad.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.876
But that's not why I came here.

37:52.139 --> 37:53.358
I just...

37:54.620 --> 37:56.274
I just missed you.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.714
'Cause you had a dream.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.107
You just knew.

38:06.719 --> 38:09.417
And there you are, well,

38:09.461 --> 38:11.027
you're living it.

38:12.899 --> 38:15.858
And I couldn't be more proud.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.645
[sighs]

38:21.081 --> 38:23.431
- I'm proud of you too, Shell.

38:24.389 --> 38:28.088
No matter where you go
or what you do.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.438
I'm so proud of you.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.136
[chuckling]

38:33.180 --> 38:34.703
- Thanks, girl.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.491
- Don't come back to
the hospital, though.
Don't do that.

38:39.534 --> 38:42.102
- I might send you there first.
[laughing]

38:45.018 --> 38:46.280
[indistinct announcement
over speaker]

38:46.324 --> 38:48.108
- Just one second.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.810
[phone number pad beeping]

38:55.681 --> 38:57.378
[phone ringing tone]

38:57.422 --> 38:59.511
[Devon]: You've reached Devon.
Please leave a message.

38:59.554 --> 39:00.729
[beeps]

39:01.251 --> 39:03.123
- Hey, I'm...

39:04.733 --> 39:06.344
I'm not coming home.

39:09.695 --> 39:12.872
I'm so sorry, Devon,
but I can't marry you.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.788
You deserve a perfect person.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.750
And that's just not me anymore.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.583
[indistinct announcement
over speaker]

39:38.201 --> 39:40.116
- Any answers at the bottom?

39:43.337 --> 39:45.905
I heard about
the carotid bleed.

39:45.948 --> 39:47.602
And Bodie.

39:47.820 --> 39:50.779
- Yeah, you must think
I'm the world's biggest
asshole, huh?

39:56.437 --> 39:58.918
- I get why you came up
here now.

39:59.658 --> 40:03.052
Why you've been
so intense lately.

40:04.227 --> 40:08.318
I wasn't sure at first, but...

40:10.016 --> 40:12.061
You're running from something.

40:14.107 --> 40:15.717
Whatever it is, Hayley,

40:15.761 --> 40:18.894
you're going to keep hurting
people until you deal with it.

40:20.330 --> 40:21.941
Including yourself.

40:25.727 --> 40:29.383
My kookum was a prominent elder.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.517
It was a lot of pressure.

40:33.474 --> 40:34.867
And...

40:36.956 --> 40:38.436
I was afraid.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.702
So I ran from it.

40:44.354 --> 40:46.748
Started partying,

40:46.792 --> 40:49.098
getting into trouble
with Jeremy.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.364
And then I got pregnant.

40:58.673 --> 41:00.501
I was barely 17.

41:03.809 --> 41:07.682
But I... I knew things
had to change.

41:07.726 --> 41:09.205
And...

41:10.772 --> 41:12.992
I had to walk away from Jeremy.

41:17.910 --> 41:21.174
He was never going to be
the man I needed to have
the baby with.

41:21.609 --> 41:25.352
But in the end,
it didn't matter,

41:25.395 --> 41:28.355
because eight weeks in,
I had a miscarriage.

41:28.398 --> 41:30.052
- I'm sorry.

41:32.185 --> 41:34.404
- I made peace with it
a long time ago.

41:36.711 --> 41:39.061
It was the push I needed
to stop running.

41:42.151 --> 41:44.327
- I don't think I can run
anymore.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.548
- So what are you going to do?

41:48.288 --> 41:50.682
- I think I need to get an MRI.

41:53.598 --> 41:56.514
[soft music]

42:33.942 --> 42:35.291
- Shit.

42:46.651 --> 42:48.522
[sighs]

42:53.353 --> 42:55.485
[speaking Anishinaabemowin]

43:00.534 --> 43:02.884
Really good work.
Pack it up.

43:04.538 --> 43:05.365
[clearing throat]

43:05.408 --> 43:06.671
- Hey.

43:09.499 --> 43:13.329
What can you tell me about
my mom, Jolene?

43:16.419 --> 43:18.508
[tense music]

43:42.097 --> 43:44.012
