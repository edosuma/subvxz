02:06.275 --> 02:10.193
Johnny.

02:21.206 --> 02:22.205
I've been thinking.

02:22.207 --> 02:23.248
Oh, man.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.251
Should I duck and cover?

02:25.253 --> 02:27.210
You know what you need?

02:27.212 --> 02:29.212
Please don't tell me.

02:29.214 --> 02:32.216
You need to get laid,
big time.

02:32.218 --> 02:34.217
I don't need to do anything.

02:34.219 --> 02:36.262
People are going to start
wondering about you, Eric.

02:36.264 --> 02:40.181
So let them.

02:40.183 --> 02:43.227
Maybe I should
fix you up with Karen.

02:43.229 --> 02:48.232
Why would you fix me
up with your girlfriend?

02:48.234 --> 02:50.234
She could use a good laugh.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.235
She only moans when
she's with me.

02:52.237 --> 02:53.236
Yeesh.

02:53.238 --> 02:54.238
I don't blame her.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.240
Dude, how can you
pass that up?

02:57.242 --> 03:00.244
Easy: I know where
them lips have been.

03:01.456 --> 03:03.246
You're still going to be a
virgin when you go to college.

03:03.248 --> 03:04.247
- Oh!
- Sorry.

03:04.249 --> 03:06.250
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

03:06.252 --> 03:07.251
They have secret
societies

03:07.253 --> 03:08.252
that sacrifice people like you!

03:22.267 --> 03:24.226
Are we going to
party hard tonight?

03:24.228 --> 03:25.269
Oh, yes, we are.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.187
Eric is even coming.

03:27.189 --> 03:28.229
All right!

03:28.231 --> 03:29.230
I thought you
were too much of a pussy

03:29.232 --> 03:30.232
to party on a school night.

03:30.234 --> 03:32.192
You call that thinking?

03:33.403 --> 03:36.280
Let's bounce, Eric doesn't
want to be late for English.

03:36.282 --> 03:39.240
And Rhonda Young...

03:39.242 --> 03:40.241
Yo, Eric!

03:40.243 --> 03:41.160
Yeah, Todd?

03:41.162 --> 03:42.161
What are you doing hanging out

03:42.163 --> 03:44.204
with these headbangers, man?

03:44.206 --> 03:46.164
What do you care?

03:46.166 --> 03:47.291
Look, man, I'm team captain

03:47.293 --> 03:49.168
and I don't like seeing you
hanging out

03:49.170 --> 03:50.252
with this trash, bro!

03:50.254 --> 03:52.253
It looks bad on our image, dude.

03:52.255 --> 03:54.173
Who are you calling trash?

03:54.175 --> 03:55.216
Hey!

03:55.218 --> 03:57.258
It talks, too.

03:57.260 --> 03:59.220
I'm calling you trash, Gruesome.

03:59.222 --> 04:02.222
You and your little slut and
your dope dealing sidekick.

04:02.224 --> 04:04.224
The name is Grissom.

04:04.226 --> 04:06.185
Yeah?

04:06.187 --> 04:09.229
You look pretty gruesome
to me there, pal.

04:09.231 --> 04:14.234
All right, all three of you...

04:14.236 --> 04:15.276
It ain't worth it, Johnny!

04:15.278 --> 04:18.279
You two just get to watch.

04:18.281 --> 04:19.988
I got it.

04:19.991 --> 04:20.826
I got it.

04:30.169 --> 04:31.169
Watch the car!

04:35.258 --> 04:37.258
You just made a big mistake,
you long-haired freak.

04:41.179 --> 04:43.263
Let me
make another one.

04:43.265 --> 04:45.181
Come on, Todd!

04:45.183 --> 04:46.267
Come on, Todd, kick his ass!

04:46.269 --> 04:48.227
- Come on, Todd!
- Kick his ass, man!

04:48.229 --> 04:50.270
Show him what
you've got, Johnny!

04:50.272 --> 04:52.275
Come on, get him!

05:05.203 --> 05:06.203
All right, man!

05:06.205 --> 05:08.205
That's enough, Johnny!

05:08.207 --> 05:11.249
What the hell is my name?

05:11.251 --> 05:13.169
Grissom!

05:13.171 --> 05:17.213
Get the hell
off my car!

05:17.215 --> 05:19.215
Don't touch me, man!

05:19.217 --> 05:21.052
Who's gruesome now?

05:35.193 --> 05:38.234
"Like one man on a lonesome
road, doth walk in fear

05:38.236 --> 05:42.198
"and dread, and having once
turned round,

05:42.200 --> 05:46.243
"turns no more his head, because
he knows a frightful fiend

05:46.245 --> 05:49.162
"doth close behind him tread."

05:49.164 --> 05:51.164
Wooooo!

05:52.250 --> 05:53.249
Johnny?

05:53.251 --> 05:55.169
Yes, Mrs. Crane?

05:55.171 --> 05:58.172
Shut up.

05:58.174 --> 05:59.174
Yes, ma'am.

06:02.178 --> 06:03.219
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Crane.

06:03.221 --> 06:05.261
Mr. Milton wanted
me to give you this.

06:05.263 --> 06:06.098
Thank you, Rhonda.

06:11.270 --> 06:14.229
Hey, Rhonda, how about
going for a joy ride tonight?

06:14.231 --> 06:15.232
Drop dead, Grissom.

06:24.282 --> 06:25.951
Shit.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.162
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Milton?

06:30.164 --> 06:33.207
Trust me, desire has nothing
to do with it, Grissom.

06:33.209 --> 06:36.167
Todd claims you did this
to him in the parking lot.

06:36.169 --> 06:37.253
So?

06:37.255 --> 06:38.923
Nurse.

06:43.051 --> 06:43.885
Sit!

06:52.227 --> 06:53.811
When are you going to learn
you can't use my school

06:53.813 --> 06:55.229
as your personal
stomping ground?

06:55.231 --> 06:56.229
He started it.

06:56.231 --> 06:58.232
It's always the other guy,
isn't it?

06:58.234 --> 07:00.234
You never do anything wrong.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.193
Well, I got news for you mister:

07:02.195 --> 07:04.196
your reign of terror is over.

07:04.198 --> 07:08.200
I'm suspending you for a
week, effective immediately.

07:08.202 --> 07:10.201
That asshole was
looking for trouble!

07:10.203 --> 07:11.203
Maybe that's why he
didn't press charges,

07:11.205 --> 07:12.246
consider yourself lucky.

07:12.248 --> 07:14.164
This is bullshit!

07:14.166 --> 07:16.208
Come on, Grissom, we've both
played this game long enough

07:16.210 --> 07:17.208
to know the rules.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.210
How many times
you sat in that chair?

07:19.212 --> 07:22.172
You said I couldn't graduate
if I missed anymore days.

07:22.174 --> 07:25.258
Oh, don't worry, I'm not
going to flunk you over this.

07:25.260 --> 07:28.261
That'd be like punishing
myself, wouldn't it?

07:28.263 --> 07:31.181
But this is the final
inning, one more strike

07:31.183 --> 07:32.224
and you're out on your rear.

07:32.226 --> 07:35.268
I'm talking expulsion.

07:35.270 --> 07:36.271
Got it?

07:40.025 --> 07:40.859
Yeah.

07:41.193 --> 07:42.275
Got it.

07:42.277 --> 07:43.527
Get out of my sight.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.196
I don't want to see your face
around here for another week.

08:23.193 --> 08:24.234
What the hell
are you doing back here?

08:24.236 --> 08:26.236
Don't worry about it.

08:26.238 --> 08:28.698
Answer me, goddamn it,
I'm your father!

08:31.202 --> 08:32.243
You want to know why I'm home?

08:32.245 --> 08:35.162
I want to know why you don't
have a job!

08:35.164 --> 08:36.246
You little son of a bitch!

08:36.249 --> 08:39.166
What did you just say to me?

08:39.168 --> 08:40.250
Huh?!

08:40.251 --> 08:41.253
What?!

08:45.174 --> 08:47.215
Come out here and face
me like a man!

08:47.217 --> 08:49.218
You know I can
still kick your ass!

08:55.268 --> 08:57.270
You have to come out sometime...

09:00.188 --> 09:01.229
And I'm going to be here.

09:45.275 --> 09:48.234
Wooo!

09:57.246 --> 09:58.204
Yeah!

10:30.529 --> 10:33.196
How you doing, Eric?

10:33.198 --> 10:35.199
Why aren't we moving?

10:40.206 --> 10:42.205
What's so funny?

10:42.207 --> 10:43.875
I'm not drunk.

10:50.257 --> 10:53.258
Not in my car, Gary.

10:53.260 --> 10:56.220
Fine.

11:09.193 --> 11:11.234
Hold on.

11:11.236 --> 11:13.237
Hold on?

11:13.239 --> 11:17.199
Why hold on?

11:17.201 --> 11:18.242
Slow down, Johnny.

11:18.244 --> 11:19.912
Who you
telling what to do?

11:21.246 --> 11:23.247
That's fast enough, Johnny.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.249
Fuck you.

11:26.251 --> 11:28.252
Johnny, come on, man!

11:28.254 --> 11:29.210
Fuck you, too.

11:29.212 --> 11:30.253
You're going to
get us all killed!

11:30.255 --> 11:32.214
Fuck all of you!

11:36.178 --> 11:37.261
Slow down!

11:37.263 --> 11:40.221
Gary!

11:40.223 --> 11:42.266
Gary, come on, dude!

11:42.268 --> 11:44.270
You're killing him!

11:50.233 --> 11:51.191
No!

11:58.159 --> 11:59.282
Gary!

11:59.284 --> 12:01.159
Gary, stop!

12:01.161 --> 12:04.205
What is wrong with you?!

12:04.207 --> 12:06.206
- Gary!
- Get the fuck out here!

12:06.208 --> 12:08.209
You stay!

12:08.211 --> 12:11.170
You fucking freak!

12:13.256 --> 12:15.257
Do something!

12:19.263 --> 12:22.181
Gary, stop!

12:22.183 --> 12:24.224
Please!

12:24.226 --> 12:25.267
Johnny!

12:37.280 --> 12:38.949
No!

12:45.206 --> 12:49.207
Oh, God!

12:58.260 --> 13:00.261
No!

13:06.184 --> 13:09.269
Fucking asshole!

13:09.271 --> 13:12.189
Cool it!

13:14.276 --> 13:16.277
Don't you dare get sick, Eric!

13:16.279 --> 13:19.238
We can't leave any evidence
and that includes your barf.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.197
What are you talking about?

13:21.199 --> 13:23.200
We have to make this
look like an accident!

13:23.202 --> 13:24.243
We?!

13:24.245 --> 13:26.244
You did this!

13:26.246 --> 13:27.245
You killed him!

13:27.247 --> 13:31.207
He was going to kill
all three of us!

13:31.209 --> 13:32.209
No!

13:32.211 --> 13:33.210
Oh, God!

13:33.212 --> 13:37.255
He was not serious, he
wouldn't...

13:37.257 --> 13:38.257
It was you!

13:38.259 --> 13:39.425
Bullshit!

13:39.427 --> 13:42.219
He wanted to punch his own
ticket and take us with him.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.262
He was out of his freaking mind!

13:43.264 --> 13:45.263
You're out of
your fucking mind!

13:45.265 --> 13:49.268
You're so wired you don't know
what's real and what isn't.

13:49.270 --> 13:52.229
You tell him.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.229
He's right, Eric.

13:55.193 --> 13:58.234
Look at the car.

13:58.236 --> 14:00.237
If I hadn't pulled the
emergency brake,

14:00.239 --> 14:03.239
we'd all be dead right now.

14:03.241 --> 14:05.200
You didn't have to kill him!

14:05.202 --> 14:07.161
What do you think would've
happened if I let him go?

14:07.163 --> 14:08.412
You knew how he was!

14:08.414 --> 14:12.248
I had to protect myself, I had
to protect all three of us!

14:12.250 --> 14:13.249
Oh, Jesus.

14:13.251 --> 14:16.211
Why didn't you stop me?

14:16.213 --> 14:17.213
Everything happened so fast.

14:17.215 --> 14:21.216
You mean you were too scared.

14:21.218 --> 14:25.262
Look, if it was self-defense,
the cops will understand.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.223
Are you nuts?

14:27.225 --> 14:29.266
They'll hang me out to
dry, and you two with me.

14:29.268 --> 14:33.229
They'll label us drug-addicts
and devil-worshipers.

14:33.231 --> 14:35.230
They'll lock us up and throw
away the key,

14:35.232 --> 14:37.233
our lives will be ruined.

14:37.235 --> 14:41.237
Our parent's lives
will be ruined.

14:41.239 --> 14:42.278
Just give me a minute
to think, all right?

14:42.280 --> 14:44.156
By all means, take your time.

14:44.158 --> 14:45.282
It's not like anybody
could drive around here

14:45.284 --> 14:46.242
any second and see...

14:46.244 --> 14:48.284
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?!

14:48.286 --> 14:50.204
We cannot do this!

14:50.206 --> 14:52.163
We have to go to the police.

14:52.165 --> 14:54.166
Johnny is dead!

14:54.168 --> 14:57.210
What's done is done, and nothing
is going to bring him back.

14:57.212 --> 14:59.213
No!

14:59.215 --> 15:01.257
Do you want to pay for
this the rest of your life?

15:01.259 --> 15:04.176
There's no way we get away
with this.

15:04.178 --> 15:05.301
Who's going to investigate it?

15:05.303 --> 15:09.264
Chief Crane's job is handing
out speeding tickets.

15:09.266 --> 15:14.144
No matter what we do,
we'll still miss something.

15:14.146 --> 15:18.273
Eric, nobody will know
what happened here except us.

15:18.275 --> 15:22.235
Do what he says, Eric.

15:22.237 --> 15:24.196
What do we do?

15:24.198 --> 15:29.159
Give him a burial at sea.

15:29.161 --> 15:32.204
You killed me,
you fucking killed me.

15:32.206 --> 15:34.205
You killed me, you killed me.

15:34.207 --> 15:36.207
You're dead,
you're dead, so dead.

15:36.209 --> 15:39.210
You're all dead to me, I'm
going to kill every one of you.

15:39.212 --> 15:42.214
I'm going to kill
every one of you.

15:53.269 --> 15:56.269
Matt?

15:56.271 --> 15:59.190
Matt, wake up.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.193
Your phone.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.199
Yeah?

16:08.201 --> 16:12.244
Jen?

16:12.246 --> 16:15.247
Oh, no.

16:15.249 --> 16:20.210
Yeah, tell Dan I'll be
there in half an hour.

16:20.212 --> 16:21.253
What is it?

16:21.255 --> 16:24.172
Some idiot drove off
the Willow Creek bridge.

16:24.174 --> 16:25.215
Oh, God!

16:25.217 --> 16:26.216
Do they know who?

16:26.218 --> 16:30.178
Not yet, the car's still in
the water.

16:38.188 --> 16:39.856
I wonder what happened.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.234
I don't know.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.234
I guess the whole
town will be talking

16:44.236 --> 16:46.237
about it soon enough.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.196
Yeah.

16:48.198 --> 16:52.243
Hey, I have something for you.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.245
Your mom's going to be
getting a new car.

16:55.247 --> 16:57.163
So this one will be yours.

16:57.165 --> 17:00.250
For being such a good kid.

17:00.252 --> 17:02.168
Thanks, Dad.

17:02.170 --> 17:03.253
Your welcome.

17:03.255 --> 17:08.175
Eric, I hope you
have a great day.

17:08.176 --> 17:09.175
You too.

17:09.178 --> 17:10.218
Thanks.

17:10.220 --> 17:13.262
I'll see you.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.289
How'd it go?

17:38.291 --> 17:41.207
My folks were in bed
when I got home.

17:41.209 --> 17:43.168
I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up.

17:43.170 --> 17:46.213
Just be cool, okay?

17:46.215 --> 17:50.216
It'll all be over soon.

17:52.179 --> 17:55.222
Thank you and good morning.

17:55.224 --> 17:58.266
It's with great sadness that
I must inform you of a tragedy

17:58.268 --> 17:59.435
which has befallen
a fellow student.

17:59.437 --> 18:03.230
John Grissom, a senior at
this school died last night

18:03.232 --> 18:05.232
in an automobile accident.

18:05.234 --> 18:06.903
Oh, shit!

18:08.236 --> 18:10.279
John was a member of the
track team his freshman year

18:10.281 --> 18:13.282
and he will be missed.

18:13.284 --> 18:17.160
Funeral arrangements
will be announced soon.

18:17.162 --> 18:19.163
What do you think happened?

18:19.165 --> 18:23.250
What goes around
comes around, bud.

18:37.265 --> 18:40.225
Eric?

18:40.227 --> 18:41.267
Oh!

18:41.269 --> 18:43.186
Hey, Rhonda.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.272
Are you hiding?

18:45.274 --> 18:48.274
Trying to.

18:48.276 --> 18:53.196
I just wanted to say how
sorry I am about Johnny.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.197
Thanks.

18:54.199 --> 18:55.241
I am.

18:55.243 --> 18:58.244
I know how close you two were.

18:58.246 --> 19:01.248
Just a couple of days ago,
you told him to drop dead.

19:03.251 --> 19:06.209
You know I didn't mean that.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.253
You don't give up, do you?

19:07.255 --> 19:09.254
Not when I can
see someone's hurting.

19:09.256 --> 19:10.255
I'm fine.

19:10.257 --> 19:13.259
So you're just
naturally rude then?

19:13.261 --> 19:15.261
I'm sorry.

19:15.263 --> 19:18.263
That's better.

19:18.265 --> 19:23.269
Look, I appreciate
your concern.

19:23.271 --> 19:25.273
Do you want to talk about it?

19:28.234 --> 19:29.233
I really don't.

19:29.235 --> 19:33.236
That's okay.
We can just sit here.

19:33.238 --> 19:37.241
Johnny G, what a shame!

19:37.243 --> 19:40.244
Not really a surprise, though.

19:40.246 --> 19:43.246
Caught that boy
shoplifting once.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.247
Can you believe it?

19:44.249 --> 19:46.250
Stealing!

19:46.252 --> 19:51.254
From a blind man, a vet at that.

19:51.256 --> 19:55.259
We were in fifth grade.

19:55.261 --> 20:00.263
John Vincent Grissom, age 17.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.265
Rigor mortis is present
in the extremities

20:02.267 --> 20:05.226
and lividity has set in.

20:05.228 --> 20:09.231
Teeth are generally in
good shape, three fillings.

20:09.233 --> 20:13.234
There's a mole on his left
arm, scar on the right knee,

20:13.236 --> 20:16.155
upper lip and right shoulder.

20:16.157 --> 20:17.281
There was a bruise
on his right breast

20:17.283 --> 20:20.283
and abrasions on the
knuckles of both hands.

20:20.285 --> 20:23.286
He was in a fight the
morning before his death.

20:23.288 --> 20:26.290
The vessels are occluded
and the face is dark red

20:26.292 --> 20:30.211
and congested, indicating
cyanosis.

20:30.213 --> 20:31.920
Clean lungs, strong heart.

20:31.922 --> 20:33.214
This was a healthy young man.

20:33.216 --> 20:38.260
You put his organs in bags
like this?

20:38.262 --> 20:39.261
After I weigh them.

20:39.263 --> 20:41.222
It makes putting the
pieces back together

20:41.224 --> 20:44.265
a little less messy.

20:44.267 --> 20:47.227
There's a fracture
here on the hyoid bone

20:47.229 --> 20:49.230
and thyroid cartilage.

20:49.232 --> 20:52.233
It's my opinion that Mr.
Grissom died of intensive

20:52.235 --> 20:55.235
and severe injury to his neck,

20:55.237 --> 20:58.196
resulting in accidental
asphyxiation.

20:58.198 --> 21:01.157
You sure this was an accident?

21:01.159 --> 21:04.244
That bruise on his neck looks...

21:04.246 --> 21:07.205
It's true, most ligature
strangulations are homicides,

21:07.207 --> 21:10.167
but that's not the case here.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.211
You and I both know
toxicology is going to show

21:12.213 --> 21:14.254
that boy was either
drunk or stoned

21:14.256 --> 21:16.173
when he drove that
car off that bridge.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.259
Wasn't wearing a seat belt,

21:18.261 --> 21:20.261
steering wheel crushed
his throat on impact,

21:20.263 --> 21:22.263
plain and simple.

21:22.265 --> 21:23.263
You're the expert.

21:53.254 --> 21:55.212
You're in the wrong bathroom.

21:55.214 --> 21:58.256
I just wanted to see if
you needed a ride home.

21:58.258 --> 22:02.261
My mom is getting me.

22:02.263 --> 22:05.263
Can I have a swig?

22:05.265 --> 22:09.225
Sure.

22:09.227 --> 22:16.233
Cheers.

22:16.235 --> 22:20.236
You want to grab
a bite to eat later?

22:20.238 --> 22:21.530
You sure?

22:21.532 --> 22:26.243
We can do something else just
to take your mind off things.

22:26.245 --> 22:29.245
It's only been a week, Gary.

22:29.247 --> 22:31.247
Right. Yeah, um...

22:31.249 --> 22:34.251
I almost forgot, actually
I got you something.

22:34.253 --> 22:35.377
What is it?

22:35.379 --> 22:36.253
Just a little something
to make you feel better

22:36.255 --> 22:41.257
than that hooch.

22:41.259 --> 22:42.259
Thanks.

22:42.261 --> 22:44.261
Yeah.

22:44.263 --> 22:50.102
Just call me if you need
anything.

23:16.294 --> 23:18.212
Eric.

23:18.214 --> 23:20.255
Hey, thanks for coming.

23:20.257 --> 23:23.216
I don't know
what to say, Charlie.

23:23.218 --> 23:24.260
Don't say anything.

23:24.262 --> 23:27.221
It's not necessary.

23:27.223 --> 23:32.184
You know, thank your folks for
the flowers for me, will you?

23:32.186 --> 23:33.226
That was real nice of them.

23:33.228 --> 23:37.148
Sure, of course.

23:38.234 --> 23:42.278
Christ, I need a drink.

23:42.280 --> 23:47.282
Take it easy, you can
go home in a little while.

23:47.284 --> 23:49.159
Home to what?

23:49.161 --> 23:51.161
An empty house?

23:51.163 --> 23:56.167
I was a rotten husband
and a lousy father.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.168
And now I'm alone.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.212
Johnny loved you, Charlie.

24:00.214 --> 24:03.215
He may not have always
shown it because, well,

24:03.217 --> 24:05.216
he was Johnny.

24:05.218 --> 24:09.179
But he understood how difficult
things have been for you.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.264
I don't know.

24:11.266 --> 24:16.227
For real.

24:16.229 --> 24:18.188
Eric, you were a good friend.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.273
I mean, if it wasn't for you,

24:20.275 --> 24:22.527
we might have had this
funeral a lot sooner.

24:26.239 --> 24:29.199
Carol Crane, Mr. Grissom.

24:29.201 --> 24:33.204
Oh, Matt's wife, right?

24:33.206 --> 24:34.245
Johnny really liked you.

24:34.247 --> 24:36.206
I'm so sorry for your loss.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.207
Thank you.

24:37.209 --> 24:43.171
Excuse me.

24:43.173 --> 24:44.173
Where's Karen?

24:44.175 --> 24:47.176
Maybe she turned chicken.

24:47.178 --> 24:48.260
Check out the crate yet?

24:48.262 --> 24:51.222
No, I'm not going to.

24:51.224 --> 24:52.388
Don't be a schmuck.

24:52.390 --> 24:57.227
We don't want to draw any
attention to ourselves, do we?

24:57.229 --> 24:58.228
No-one's going to notice

24:58.230 --> 25:00.231
if I don't look
inside that coffin.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.232
Think again.

25:01.234 --> 25:05.235
This time look at
Chief Crane over there.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.196
Come on.

25:07.198 --> 25:08.238
Why do they call it the
slumber room anyway?

25:08.240 --> 25:12.243
Its not like anyone ever wakes
up in here.

25:12.245 --> 25:14.244
Did you hear the one about
the Jewish undertaker?

25:14.246 --> 25:20.167
Shut up.

25:22.255 --> 25:23.253
It doesn't even look like him.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.171
Yeah, they have to make you
presentable

25:25.173 --> 25:28.259
before they throw you in the
ground and cover you with dirt.

25:28.261 --> 25:31.262
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I was wondering

25:31.264 --> 25:32.263
if I could ask you for a favor.

25:32.265 --> 25:35.224
Name it.

25:35.226 --> 25:39.270
Could I impose on you
to serve as pall bearers?

25:39.272 --> 25:41.187
You can count on us.

25:41.189 --> 25:42.273
Wonderful.

25:42.275 --> 25:46.234
I'm sure the deceased
appreciates your assistance,

25:46.236 --> 25:48.154
wherever he is.

26:38.246 --> 26:44.209
Our physical bodies cannot
inherit the kingdom of God.

26:44.211 --> 26:49.255
While we may not all sleep,
we will all be transformed,

26:49.257 --> 26:52.176
for when the trumpet sounds,

26:52.178 --> 26:56.222
those who have died will
be raised to live forever.

26:56.224 --> 26:59.265
Those who are living
will also be transformed,

26:59.267 --> 27:03.186
because our dying bodies
must be transformed

27:03.188 --> 27:06.189
into bodies that never die.

27:06.191 --> 27:11.236
Our mortal bodies must be
transformed into immortal bodies.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.196
Death...

27:12.198 --> 27:13.238
I think they're
going to be a while,

27:13.240 --> 27:15.241
want to grab a
brew while we wait?

27:15.243 --> 27:16.242
- As long as you're buying.
- I always buy.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.255
I can't wait until
I get my degree

27:30.257 --> 27:32.215
so I can get the
hell up out of here.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.217
Yeah, what then?

27:34.219 --> 27:35.261
You'll be an engineer
in Buffalo instead

27:35.263 --> 27:37.263
of a grave digger in Red Hill.

27:37.265 --> 27:38.263
Same shit when winter comes.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.264
Uh-uh.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.266
Fuck that, I'm going to Florida.

27:41.268 --> 27:42.267
You think that's any better?

27:42.269 --> 27:43.894
I'll be away from
his snow, won't I?

27:43.896 --> 27:46.230
Sure, but you'll have
hurricanes instead.

27:46.232 --> 27:50.234
Humidity, alligators,
mutant insects.

27:50.236 --> 27:53.236
Okay, I'll be away
from all these stiffs.

27:54.239 --> 28:00.244
You ever been to Florida?

29:55.277 --> 29:58.236
Pst!

30:10.251 --> 30:14.211
What the f...!

30:14.213 --> 30:15.212
Wha?!

30:59.175 --> 31:01.216
Oh!

31:01.218 --> 31:06.179
Ugh!

32:08.285 --> 32:10.160
Ugh!

32:21.173 --> 32:24.215
Hello?

32:24.217 --> 32:27.261
Hello?

32:27.263 --> 32:30.180
How the hell did
you get that phone?

32:30.182 --> 32:33.266
Listen, asshole, if you
don't stop calling me,

32:33.268 --> 32:35.270
I'm calling the cops.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.201
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

33:26.238 --> 33:30.198
It's seven o'clock,
we're the only ones here.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.242
Yeah, how romantic.

33:31.244 --> 33:33.244
You going to be much longer?

33:33.246 --> 33:34.244
I've got to mop up in here.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.246
Do you know who I am?

33:36.248 --> 33:38.249
Do you know who my father is?

33:38.251 --> 33:41.167
Mop somewhere else tonight,
no-one's going to know.

33:41.169 --> 33:42.253
I'm done when I'm
good and ready.

33:42.255 --> 33:43.922
Jesus Christ.

33:56.185 --> 33:57.225
What the hell?

33:59.229 --> 34:00.186
Darryl!

34:00.188 --> 34:01.272
Turn the lights back on.

34:01.274 --> 34:03.232
Asshole!

34:16.164 --> 34:17.331
Do you want to keep your job?

34:21.043 --> 34:22.043
Well?

34:23.838 --> 34:25.840
You are fucking
with the wrong guy!

34:34.222 --> 34:37.224
Grissom?

34:37.226 --> 34:39.184
You're dead, you son of a bitch!

35:14.222 --> 35:16.262
We missed you at
practice yesterday, Eric.

35:16.264 --> 35:18.224
Sorry, coach.

35:18.226 --> 35:20.267
I ran on my own.

35:20.269 --> 35:24.187
Look, I know you're
still upset about Johnny,

35:24.189 --> 35:27.191
but tonight's meet is important.

35:27.193 --> 35:29.193
We can win this one.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.276
I understand.

35:30.278 --> 35:32.195
Good man!

35:39.247 --> 35:41.204
Hey, coach.

35:41.206 --> 35:44.207
Good morning, Mark.

35:53.260 --> 35:55.260
Coach!

36:39.222 --> 36:42.224
Somebody's body is hanging
upside down in the gym!

36:42.226 --> 36:43.225
It's Todd.

36:43.227 --> 36:44.225
How do you know?

36:44.227 --> 36:47.229
His head is in my locker.

36:47.231 --> 36:48.229
How'd it get there?

36:48.231 --> 36:50.231
I sure as hell
didn't put it there!

36:50.233 --> 36:52.276
We have to get rid of this
thing before the cops show up!

36:52.278 --> 36:53.526
We?!

36:53.528 --> 36:55.236
Yeah, you're up to your neck
in this just as much as I am.

36:55.238 --> 36:56.238
I had nothing to do with this.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.240
Neither did I, but if
the cops think I did,

36:58.242 --> 37:00.242
they might take a look
at Johnny's accident

37:00.244 --> 37:01.452
a little more closely.

37:01.454 --> 37:04.162
I'm getting tired of helping
you clean up your messes.

37:04.164 --> 37:06.164
Dude, I'm the victim here.

37:06.166 --> 37:07.291
And as for the other thing,

37:07.293 --> 37:11.294
you're not some innocent
bystander, you're an accessory.

37:11.296 --> 37:14.215
What are we supposed to do,
carry him out the front door?

37:14.217 --> 37:15.423
Can I have your gym bag?

37:15.425 --> 37:17.258
Give me your fucking gym
bag or I'll take it from you!

37:17.260 --> 37:19.178
That's what you think.

37:21.224 --> 37:22.222
Oh, my God!

37:22.224 --> 37:23.932
Oh, my God!

37:23.934 --> 37:24.934
Go to homeroom now!

37:24.936 --> 37:25.934
Gym is canceled!

37:25.936 --> 37:26.978
Move, now!

37:34.153 --> 37:36.236
Holy crap!

37:40.284 --> 37:42.283
All right...

37:42.285 --> 37:44.202
Stick it in.

37:44.204 --> 37:45.454
You're joking, right?

37:45.456 --> 37:48.207
Yeah, I always get funny when
there's a head in my locker.

37:48.209 --> 37:50.209
Stop joking around
and put it in.

37:50.211 --> 37:52.253
Hell, no!

37:52.255 --> 37:57.216
Fine, just hold onto this
while I do it.

37:59.262 --> 38:00.260
What's wrong?

38:00.262 --> 38:02.220
It's stuck.

38:03.265 --> 38:04.097
Hurry up.

38:04.099 --> 38:04.933
Ah!

38:14.026 --> 38:14.861
Oh, God.

38:28.249 --> 38:30.207
You're coming with me.

38:30.209 --> 38:31.207
That's what you think.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.417
Huh, guess what pal?

38:32.419 --> 38:35.213
You just put your fingerprints
all over the bag, come on!

38:40.218 --> 38:42.178
Carol, you don't
want to see this.

38:42.180 --> 38:43.347
Let go of me, Michael!

38:55.233 --> 38:58.234
I told you not
to look at this.

38:58.236 --> 39:02.198
Your husband is on his way.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.078
Go back to your classroom
and look after your students.

39:10.249 --> 39:13.166
I swear to God someone's
trying to frame me.

39:13.168 --> 39:14.251
People don't have morals
anymore, huh?

39:14.253 --> 39:16.253
You could say that again.

39:16.255 --> 39:18.004
Here.

39:18.006 --> 39:18.883
Hm?

39:30.186 --> 39:31.184
Head's up.

39:31.186 --> 39:33.269
Hey, you can't tell
anyone about this,

39:33.271 --> 39:36.231
especially not Karen.

39:43.282 --> 39:44.280
Huh.

39:44.282 --> 39:46.158
Just in time, huh?

39:46.160 --> 39:47.158
Let's go.

39:51.289 --> 39:53.289
Has anyone
touched that body?

39:53.291 --> 39:56.209
No-one's been inside
at all until just now.

39:56.211 --> 39:57.294
Does this building have
cameras in it?

39:57.296 --> 39:58.336
Only in the front lobby.

39:58.338 --> 40:01.173
It's a safe school, we
don't even have vandalism.

40:01.175 --> 40:03.258
- I'll need that footage.
- You got it.

40:03.260 --> 40:05.260
It happened here,
then the perp

40:05.262 --> 40:07.262
dragged the body across the gym.

40:07.264 --> 40:10.182
My office has the
attendance reports,

40:10.184 --> 40:11.267
we can find out who this is.

40:13.186 --> 40:14.227
I know who it is.

40:14.229 --> 40:16.229
Marty Kumler called
this morning.

40:16.231 --> 40:18.274
Todd never came home last night.

40:18.276 --> 40:20.233
Oh, no!

40:28.285 --> 40:29.200
Hey, what's up?

40:29.202 --> 40:30.202
Where you going?

40:30.204 --> 40:31.287
To see Johnny's father.

40:31.289 --> 40:32.245
Come on, get in.

40:32.247 --> 40:34.247
Sure.

40:42.258 --> 40:47.260
No problem.

40:47.262 --> 40:49.220
Is he up here on the right?

40:49.222 --> 40:52.224
Yeah, I'll let you
know when we get close.

40:52.226 --> 40:55.227
Okay.

40:55.229 --> 40:57.271
I can't believe what happened to
Todd.

40:57.273 --> 41:00.191
Neither can I.

41:00.193 --> 41:02.193
I heard they arrested
Darryl Bauer.

41:02.195 --> 41:03.276
The janitor?

41:03.278 --> 41:05.195
The biggest story
to hit this town

41:05.197 --> 41:07.238
and I'm stuck working a beat
at a monthly school newspaper.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.218
Thanks for the lift.

41:28.220 --> 41:30.262
Do you mind if I join you?

41:30.264 --> 41:34.225
I feel bad I didn't
go to the funeral.

41:34.227 --> 41:39.229
I'm sure Charlie would
appreciate the company.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.245
Maybe he isn't home?

41:54.247 --> 41:56.457
Charlie's always
home in the daytime.

42:04.173 --> 42:05.171
- Oh, shit!
- What?

42:05.173 --> 42:06.256
Something bad, stand back.

42:06.258 --> 42:09.175
Wait.

42:16.269 --> 42:24.233
Thank you.

42:34.287 --> 42:35.288
Call 911.

42:47.215 --> 42:49.258
And that's exactly
how you found him?

42:49.260 --> 42:54.180
Yeah, surrounded by
all those empty bottles.

42:54.182 --> 42:57.224
Yeah, well, I guess that isn't
much a surprise now, is it?

42:57.226 --> 42:59.225
No, sir.

42:59.227 --> 43:01.227
You'd best be getting home,
your folks will be worried

43:01.229 --> 43:02.937
about you after
what's happened today.

43:02.939 --> 43:03.939
All right.

43:03.941 --> 43:05.899
Thanks for your help.

43:05.901 --> 43:06.941
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

43:06.943 --> 43:08.234
Thanks.

43:11.198 --> 43:16.202
What do you see?

43:16.204 --> 43:19.245
Nothing, just my imagination.

43:21.166 --> 43:23.166
Are you sure?

43:23.168 --> 43:24.167
Yeah.

43:52.197 --> 43:53.238
What are you doing here?

43:53.240 --> 43:57.200
Your mother let me in.

43:57.202 --> 43:59.202
What's wrong?

43:59.204 --> 44:01.204
Suffering from a guilty
conscience?

44:01.206 --> 44:03.207
Aren't you?

44:03.209 --> 44:04.207
At least I went to the
funeral.

44:04.209 --> 44:06.251
Don't you think I wanted to?

44:06.253 --> 44:10.213
I loved Johnny.

44:10.215 --> 44:11.256
I just couldn't do it.

44:11.258 --> 44:14.260
I couldn't see him like that.

44:14.262 --> 44:18.180
Charlie's dead.

44:18.182 --> 44:20.182
Drank himself to death.

44:20.184 --> 44:22.225
Oh, poor Charlie.

44:22.227 --> 44:25.229
Yeah, two people died
on that bridge.

44:25.231 --> 44:28.231
Eric, I've been
getting phone calls.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.233
Congratulations.

44:30.235 --> 44:31.234
Prank calls.

44:31.236 --> 44:33.236
Whoever it is,
doesn't say anything.

44:33.238 --> 44:37.198
Look, call the police if
you're worried.

44:37.200 --> 44:40.244
The calls are being
made on Johnny's phone.

44:40.246 --> 44:41.245
That doesn't even make sense.

44:41.247 --> 44:43.247
I'm scared.

44:43.249 --> 44:46.166
What if whoever it is
knows what we did?

44:46.168 --> 44:49.253
Maybe it's Gary.

44:49.255 --> 44:51.213
He wouldn't do this to me.

44:51.215 --> 44:52.213
Oh, yeah?

44:52.215 --> 44:57.178
Kind of sounds like
you caught his cold.

44:57.180 --> 44:59.220
Eric...

44:59.222 --> 45:02.265
Karen, dear, you're
welcome to stay for dinner.

45:02.267 --> 45:05.227
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Carter, I have to get home.

45:05.229 --> 45:07.229
She's expecting a call.

45:07.231 --> 45:11.233
Well, tell your mother
I said hello, okay?

46:30.231 --> 46:32.189
Oh, God!

46:32.191 --> 46:34.191
Where?

46:34.193 --> 46:35.276
I don't see him.

46:35.278 --> 46:38.195
You killed Todd.

46:38.197 --> 46:41.198
You're damn straight.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.240
What do you want?

46:42.242 --> 46:45.202
How about...

46:45.204 --> 46:48.204
A kiss?

46:48.206 --> 46:50.207
You're dead.

46:50.209 --> 46:53.209
You're supposed to be dead.

46:53.211 --> 46:54.253
Why aren't you dead?!

46:54.255 --> 46:56.171
I couldn't sleep!

47:58.276 --> 48:01.278
Do you think they'll cancel
the rest of your track season?

48:01.280 --> 48:02.320
I hope so.

48:02.322 --> 48:05.240
I never wanted to join the
team in the first place.

48:05.242 --> 48:06.242
Why did you?

48:06.244 --> 48:09.160
Johnny talked me
into joining with him.

48:09.162 --> 48:10.287
Quits the team after he
gets into an argument

48:10.289 --> 48:12.289
with Coach Wrangler.

48:12.291 --> 48:13.289
Sounds like Johnny.

48:13.291 --> 48:17.211
Yeah.

48:17.213 --> 48:20.171
What did you see
at the house today?

48:20.173 --> 48:22.258
I told you, nothing.

48:22.260 --> 48:26.178
What do you think you saw?

48:26.180 --> 48:27.890
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

48:30.226 --> 48:33.269
Try me.

48:39.235 --> 48:41.151
How's it going?

48:41.153 --> 48:42.236
Hi.

48:42.238 --> 48:43.236
Everything's fine.

48:43.238 --> 48:48.283
Oh, I bet.

48:48.285 --> 48:55.207
Oh, no, don't worry, we got ours
to go.

48:55.209 --> 48:56.249
Are they dating?

48:56.251 --> 48:59.169
I don't know.

49:28.075 --> 49:28.909
Goodnight.

49:30.035 --> 49:30.869
Goodnight.

49:50.180 --> 49:51.012
Bye.

49:51.014 --> 49:51.890
See you.

50:57.247 --> 50:59.289
Drinking alone?

50:59.291 --> 51:02.209
It's been that kind of week.

51:02.211 --> 51:03.209
Yeah, it has.

51:07.258 --> 51:09.258
Don't answer it.

51:09.260 --> 51:12.220
Every time you answer
it, someone else is dead.

51:19.269 --> 51:21.227
Hey.

51:21.229 --> 51:22.271
Hey.

51:22.273 --> 51:24.273
Hey, hey hey.

51:24.275 --> 51:26.233
Easy.

51:26.235 --> 51:28.234
Easy, honey.

51:28.236 --> 51:31.238
I know what
you're going through.

51:31.240 --> 51:33.282
It's going to be okay,
all right?

51:33.284 --> 51:37.160
It's going to be okay.

51:46.255 --> 51:48.254
Morning, Erica.

51:48.256 --> 51:49.256
Don't call me that.

51:49.258 --> 51:50.256
Oh, what's wrong,
Romeo?

51:50.258 --> 51:53.176
Didn't things go well
with Rhonda last night?

51:53.178 --> 51:54.220
Mind your business.

51:54.222 --> 51:57.263
Relax, I've got to
give you credit.

51:57.265 --> 52:00.184
It's about time you made
a move on that book worm.

52:00.186 --> 52:02.186
Like you made a move on Karen?

52:02.188 --> 52:04.271
Now she's available,
isn't she?

52:04.273 --> 52:06.189
I'm glad you got what
you were after.

52:06.191 --> 52:08.191
What's that
supposed to mean?

52:08.193 --> 52:09.193
Isn't Johnny dead
because you wanted

52:09.195 --> 52:11.195
to get in Karen's pants?

52:11.197 --> 52:12.195
Keep it down, would you?

52:12.197 --> 52:14.240
Jesus, what are you
trying to do?

52:14.242 --> 52:16.200
I'm getting rid of a bad itch.

52:17.202 --> 52:21.204
I'm warning you, shut up.

52:21.206 --> 52:26.209
What if I don't, you
going to kill me too?

52:26.211 --> 52:28.254
Look, I'm done with you
and Karen, all right?

52:28.256 --> 52:33.216
Any more dead heads pop
up, you get her help.

52:53.197 --> 52:55.238
Hello!

52:55.240 --> 52:58.200
Who goes there?!

52:58.202 --> 53:01.202
Uh, hi, Bill.

53:01.204 --> 53:04.247
Johnny?!

53:04.249 --> 53:06.249
Johnny G?!

53:06.251 --> 53:09.253
Is that you?

53:09.255 --> 53:11.254
No.

53:11.256 --> 53:13.215
My name is Sam.

53:13.217 --> 53:14.216
Sam?

53:14.218 --> 53:16.176
Bullshit!

53:16.178 --> 53:18.178
I know the sound
of your voice, boy!

53:18.180 --> 53:19.262
Bill, just wait, wait a se...

53:19.264 --> 53:21.265
And I know the smell
of a dead corpse too!

53:32.235 --> 53:34.236
Oh, shit!

53:34.238 --> 53:35.278
Shit!

53:35.280 --> 53:40.242
Hey, hey, what the
hell is wrong with...?

53:40.244 --> 53:41.242
Oh, my...

53:41.244 --> 53:42.246
Oh, my God!

54:15.238 --> 54:16.236
Bitch!

54:43.224 --> 54:47.267
Eric, could I speak
with you for a moment?

54:47.269 --> 54:48.269
Sure.

54:48.271 --> 54:54.191
I'll see you later.

54:54.193 --> 54:57.193
Has anything strange
happened to you this week?

54:57.195 --> 54:58.236
Like what?

54:58.238 --> 55:01.198
Oh, I don't know, anything
out of the ordinary?

55:01.200 --> 55:04.200
Nothing about this week's
been ordinary, Ms. Crane.

55:04.202 --> 55:05.369
Why do you ask?

55:05.371 --> 55:07.245
I just thought since you
were Johnny's best friend

55:07.247 --> 55:09.247
you might have noticed
anything peculiar

55:09.249 --> 55:11.207
that's occurred this week?

55:11.209 --> 55:14.211
Did anything peculiar
happen to you?

55:14.213 --> 55:18.173
No, of course not,
don't be silly.

55:18.175 --> 55:21.176
You can go now, I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

55:21.178 --> 55:26.182
You didn't waste it.

55:41.198 --> 55:46.242
Run!

55:46.244 --> 55:51.164
It wasn't me!

55:51.166 --> 55:52.249
What's your name?

55:52.251 --> 55:53.249
Tammy.

55:53.251 --> 55:56.253
Why are you wearing that mask?

55:56.255 --> 55:57.254
It's part of a game.

55:57.256 --> 55:59.215
Can I play?

55:59.217 --> 56:02.175
Maybe.

56:02.177 --> 56:03.218
Who were those boys?

56:03.220 --> 56:05.262
My brother and his friends.

56:05.264 --> 56:07.263
Where do you live?

56:07.265 --> 56:09.225
Right there.

56:09.227 --> 56:13.269
Your mother let
you come out and play today?

56:13.271 --> 56:16.273
Didn't she warn you about the
bad man who's hurting people?

56:16.275 --> 56:17.274
Yeah.

56:17.276 --> 56:20.276
She said for us to
play in our backyard.

56:20.278 --> 56:22.195
Aren't you
afraid of me?

56:22.197 --> 56:23.238
Why should I be?

56:23.240 --> 56:24.280
Maybe I'm a monster.

56:24.282 --> 56:28.160
There's no such thing
as monsters, silly.

56:28.162 --> 56:29.160
Didn't your
mother ever tell you

56:29.162 --> 56:31.287
not to talk to strangers?

56:31.289 --> 56:34.293
You're not a stranger, I've seen
you lots of times.

56:35.293 --> 56:36.292
You have?

56:36.294 --> 56:38.965
Yeah, you live right there.

56:50.226 --> 56:52.225
What's that, gum?

56:52.227 --> 57:00.066
No gum.

57:00.068 --> 57:00.902
Just this.

57:51.204 --> 57:54.245
I heard you and
Eric had beef today.

57:54.247 --> 57:56.207
Yeah.

57:56.209 --> 57:58.249
We don't need
that pussy anymore.

57:58.251 --> 58:02.254
Whatever you say.

58:04.217 --> 58:06.175
Shit, would you put that away?

58:24.236 --> 58:26.236
Do you have to stop here?

58:26.238 --> 58:28.282
It's not like I really
had a choice.

58:37.166 --> 58:38.249
You're in quite a hurry.

58:38.251 --> 58:39.249
Can you blame us?

58:39.251 --> 58:43.254
That school's really dangerous.

58:43.256 --> 58:45.213
You two an item now?

58:45.215 --> 58:46.256
It's kind of up in the air,

58:46.258 --> 58:48.258
it's a really rough time for
both of us.

58:48.260 --> 58:52.220
Karen, is Gary here
your new beau?

58:52.222 --> 58:54.265
Yeah, I guess.

58:54.267 --> 58:56.267
There, you see that?

58:56.269 --> 58:59.269
A simple answer to a simple
question.

58:59.271 --> 59:01.271
You going to write me
a simple ticket or what?

59:01.273 --> 59:04.233
No, no ticket.

59:04.235 --> 59:07.193
Just some advice: go home.

59:07.195 --> 59:08.236
Stay there.

59:08.238 --> 59:10.155
Be careful.

59:10.157 --> 59:12.240
I don't need any more dead
teenagers on my hands.

59:12.242 --> 59:14.242
Thanks, but we're both 18,

59:14.244 --> 59:17.245
so your curfew
doesn't apply to us...

59:17.247 --> 59:19.289
Chief.

59:48.278 --> 59:53.282
You want to come inside?

59:53.284 --> 59:55.200
I better not,
my mom will freak

59:55.202 --> 59:56.202
if I don't come straight home

59:56.204 --> 59:59.287
with everything that's
happening.

59:59.289 --> 01:00:00.955
I guess I'll see
you tomorrow, then.

01:00:00.957 --> 01:00:01.876
Yeah.

01:02:48.209 --> 01:02:50.251
Jesus!

01:02:50.253 --> 01:02:53.211
What are you doing here?

01:02:53.213 --> 01:02:55.256
I need to talk to you.

01:02:55.258 --> 01:02:57.173
I almost just killed you.

01:02:57.175 --> 01:02:59.218
I lied this morning,
something strange has happened

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.218
to me this week.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.262
Go on.

01:03:02.264 --> 01:03:05.224
Yesterday, after your
husband walked away

01:03:05.226 --> 01:03:09.227
from me and Rhonda, I know
how crazy this sounds...

01:03:09.229 --> 01:03:11.271
I saw Johnny in
his bedroom window.

01:03:11.273 --> 01:03:13.189
You know that's
impossible, right?

01:03:13.191 --> 01:03:14.274
I know what I saw.

01:03:14.276 --> 01:03:18.195
I didn't then, but I do now.

01:03:18.197 --> 01:03:20.280
I just went over there and
saw his funeral suit hanging

01:03:20.282 --> 01:03:21.199
in his closet.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:28.204
Ms. Crane, what did
you want to tell me?

01:03:28.206 --> 01:03:29.247
I saw him too.

01:03:29.249 --> 01:03:30.249
I knew it!

01:03:30.251 --> 01:03:32.209
I need you to come with me.

01:03:32.211 --> 01:03:33.251
Where?

01:03:33.253 --> 01:03:36.213
I cannot believe I let
you talk me into this.

01:03:36.215 --> 01:03:38.173
You didn't need
too much convincing.

01:03:38.175 --> 01:03:39.258
I've been doing
some research online.

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.176
So have I.

01:03:41.178 --> 01:03:42.260
A visible ghost
or an animated corpse

01:03:42.262 --> 01:03:44.180
is called a revenant.

01:03:44.182 --> 01:03:46.182
Taken from the
Latin word Revenant.

01:03:46.184 --> 01:03:48.184
Meaning the returned.

01:03:48.186 --> 01:03:49.184
The only thing that can stop

01:03:49.186 --> 01:03:51.227
or trap a revenant
is running water.

01:03:51.229 --> 01:03:52.271
Should we stuff
him into a barrel

01:03:52.273 --> 01:03:56.233
and throw him
over Niagara Falls?

01:04:14.253 --> 01:04:17.171
Sorry, Mike, I didn't
mean to frighten you.

01:04:17.173 --> 01:04:18.421
It's Michael.

01:04:18.423 --> 01:04:21.216
I finished my walk through,
everything seems copacetic.

01:04:21.218 --> 01:04:22.258
You ready to go?

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.260
Yeah, I'll get my stuff,
I'll be out in a minute.

01:04:24.262 --> 01:04:30.184
I'll be in my car.

01:04:30.186 --> 01:04:34.229
Hm!

01:04:37.235 --> 01:04:39.234
My suspension
is over Mr. Milton,

01:04:39.236 --> 01:04:40.276
can I come back to school?

01:04:40.278 --> 01:04:41.278
No!

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.278
No!

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.238
You can't!

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.240
Go away!

01:04:44.242 --> 01:04:46.283
Go away, go back to
wherever you came from!

01:04:46.285 --> 01:04:49.285
Coffins are worse than
detention.

01:04:52.207 --> 01:04:54.209
I thought you weren't
afraid of me.

01:05:01.217 --> 01:05:02.216
Please!

01:05:02.218 --> 01:05:03.216
Please!

01:05:03.218 --> 01:05:04.260
Don't kill me!

01:05:04.262 --> 01:05:08.263
You need some guts, fat boy.

01:05:08.265 --> 01:05:12.225
Here, have mine!

01:05:38.253 --> 01:05:40.211
Somebody's already been here.

01:05:40.213 --> 01:05:45.175
He must have filled the dirt
back in after he crawled out.

01:05:45.177 --> 01:05:46.218
We're the only ones here.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:51.265
Yeah, the only living people
here.

01:05:51.267 --> 01:05:54.267
What do you think you're
going to prove by all this?

01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:56.227
Whether or not
Johnny's in his grave.

01:05:56.229 --> 01:05:58.189
I don't need to
see an empty coffin

01:05:58.191 --> 01:05:59.273
to know he's not in there.

01:05:59.275 --> 01:06:01.191
I do.

01:06:01.193 --> 01:06:03.193
And when we find that
it's empty, then what?

01:06:03.195 --> 01:06:06.196
Then we'll have something
concrete to show your husband.

01:06:06.198 --> 01:06:09.240
My husband isn't going to
believe that we saw Johnny.

01:06:09.242 --> 01:06:12.202
Look, if we don't convince
him, Johnny keeps killing.

01:06:33.267 --> 01:06:38.187
The liner's been
smashed to pieces.

01:06:38.189 --> 01:06:39.229
The seal's broken too.

01:06:39.231 --> 01:06:43.191
Hurry.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:55.245
No!

01:07:03.256 --> 01:07:04.254
Yeah!

01:07:37.247 --> 01:07:39.205
Oh, that's it.

01:07:39.207 --> 01:07:41.166
Oh, yeah.

01:07:41.168 --> 01:07:42.209
Baby.

01:07:42.211 --> 01:07:44.211
I love you.

01:07:46.215 --> 01:07:49.175
Oh, yeah, please, baby.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.220
Do you like being
with the king?

01:07:58.227 --> 01:08:02.229
Oh!

01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:06.233
That was great!

01:08:06.235 --> 01:08:08.276
Yeah.

01:08:15.285 --> 01:08:17.285
Carol, where the hell
have you been?

01:08:17.287 --> 01:08:20.205
Do you have any idea
how worried I've been?

01:08:20.207 --> 01:08:23.207
Rhonda Young's been murdered.

01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:24.209
What?

01:08:24.211 --> 01:08:28.212
Her throat was slit wide open.

01:08:28.215 --> 01:08:31.175
Eric and I found her body.

01:08:31.176 --> 01:08:33.218
Where?

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:36.180
In Johnny Grissom's coffin.

01:08:36.182 --> 01:08:38.224
What the hell were you
doing in Grissom's grave?

01:08:38.225 --> 01:08:40.265
Eric saw Johnny at
Charlie's house yesterday.

01:08:40.268 --> 01:08:43.270
Just after you left him and
Rhonda.

01:08:43.272 --> 01:08:44.229
That's...

01:08:44.232 --> 01:08:47.189
Impossible, I know!

01:08:47.192 --> 01:08:49.193
I saw him too.

01:08:49.194 --> 01:08:51.278
Johnny is dead.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:54.198
I didn't say he wasn't.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.242
Corpses don't get up and
climb out of their graves.

01:08:56.243 --> 01:08:59.243
Then how do you explain what
we found?

01:08:59.246 --> 01:09:01.203
I can't explain anything...

01:09:01.206 --> 01:09:04.207
Yet, but that doesn't excuse
what you did.

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:07.211
What we did is
beside the point!

01:09:07.212 --> 01:09:11.256
Someone murdered Rhonda and
hid her body in that coffin!

01:09:11.259 --> 01:09:15.176
That beautiful young
girl is dead.

01:09:15.179 --> 01:09:18.180
And Johnny's body isn't there.

01:09:18.182 --> 01:09:19.265
If someone did kill Rhonda,

01:09:19.267 --> 01:09:23.225
that same person also stole
Johnny's body.

01:09:23.228 --> 01:09:24.270
It must be the same psycho

01:09:24.272 --> 01:09:26.229
that killed Todd
and Michael Milton.

01:09:26.232 --> 01:09:29.189
Michael?

01:09:29.192 --> 01:09:31.234
Dan just found
him in his office.

01:09:31.237 --> 01:09:32.444
Oh, God.

01:09:32.446 --> 01:09:35.238
You're not leaving my sight
until we catch this maniac.

01:09:35.241 --> 01:09:40.243
He's haunting us because we
killed him.

01:09:40.245 --> 01:09:41.243
Gary choked Johnny to death.

01:09:41.246 --> 01:09:43.247
Me and Karen helped...

01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:45.247
Make it look like an accident.

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:49.252
So it was Belter.

01:09:49.254 --> 01:09:54.256
Jen, get in here.

01:09:54.259 --> 01:09:57.218
Johnny put Todd's head in
Gary's locker.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:01.265
We threw it in a drainage
pipe behind the school.

01:10:01.267 --> 01:10:04.226
Put an APB out for Gary
Belter and Karen Slatter,

01:10:04.228 --> 01:10:06.936
wanted for questioning in
connection with Grissom's death.

01:10:06.938 --> 01:10:10.190
Send two men over to the cemetery
to check out Grissom's grave,

01:10:10.192 --> 01:10:12.193
tell them to expect the worst.

01:10:12.195 --> 01:10:13.235
Send another car over to the
high school

01:10:13.237 --> 01:10:15.236
to search a drain pipe out back.

01:10:15.238 --> 01:10:18.157
Kumler's head might be in it.

01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:19.283
We're running out of men.

01:10:19.285 --> 01:10:21.284
You, sit down.

01:10:27.168 --> 01:10:28.169
Carol, wait outside.

01:10:36.259 --> 01:10:39.177
Start talking.

01:10:39.179 --> 01:10:42.222
You want to get
something to eat?

01:10:43.226 --> 01:10:44.266
What was that?

01:10:44.268 --> 01:10:47.185
My fly.

01:10:47.187 --> 01:10:49.270
Mom?

01:10:49.272 --> 01:10:50.230
You see?

01:10:50.232 --> 01:10:51.231
You're paranoid.

01:10:51.233 --> 01:10:52.233
It's probably the shit.

01:10:52.235 --> 01:10:54.235
I want more.

01:10:54.237 --> 01:10:56.236
Help yourself.

01:10:57.281 --> 01:10:59.198
There you go, that's my girl.

01:11:00.201 --> 01:11:01.283
Snort.

01:11:01.285 --> 01:11:03.284
It'll help, yeah?

01:11:15.215 --> 01:11:16.257
Hi guys, having fun?

01:11:16.259 --> 01:11:17.257
Jesus!

01:11:23.182 --> 01:11:24.181
Looks like I caught you with
your hand

01:11:24.183 --> 01:11:25.224
in the cookie jar, Gar.

01:11:25.226 --> 01:11:26.266
What the hell do you want?!

01:11:26.268 --> 01:11:27.351
Really?

01:11:27.353 --> 01:11:32.273
You kill me, total my
wheels and steal my girl...

01:11:32.275 --> 01:11:34.190
What do you think I want?!

01:11:34.192 --> 01:11:36.193
Forget it, you can
have her back!

01:11:36.195 --> 01:11:37.278
Bastard!

01:11:42.201 --> 01:11:45.202
Been there, had that.

01:11:45.204 --> 01:11:47.203
But uh...

01:11:47.205 --> 01:11:48.247
I'll let you have this.

01:12:58.236 --> 01:13:03.196
Poser.

01:13:03.198 --> 01:13:06.242
Now it's your turn.

01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:11.247
Go ahead, scream until
you're blue in the face,

01:13:11.249 --> 01:13:12.248
then we'll match.

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.291
Please!

01:13:14.293 --> 01:13:15.292
I might have let you live

01:13:15.294 --> 01:13:17.293
if you hadn't
screwed this asshole.

01:13:17.295 --> 01:13:20.213
Oh, God!

01:13:20.215 --> 01:13:21.172
It's a little too late

01:13:21.174 --> 01:13:23.217
to be getting religious,
sweetheart.

01:13:23.219 --> 01:13:25.261
I never loved him.

01:13:25.263 --> 01:13:29.181
I only ever loved you.

01:13:29.183 --> 01:13:33.226
We'll be together soon.

01:13:43.238 --> 01:13:46.282
I have never been so humiliated
in all my entire life!

01:13:46.284 --> 01:13:48.284
Picking up my son
from a police station!

01:13:48.286 --> 01:13:52.163
I just don't understand
how this could happen!

01:13:52.165 --> 01:13:53.372
You don't understand
anything about me!

01:13:53.374 --> 01:13:56.208
I certainly didn't think I
was raising a grave robber!

01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:58.209
For God's sakes, I'm not a
grave robber!

01:13:58.211 --> 01:14:00.212
Don't use that tone
with your mother, Eric!

01:14:00.214 --> 01:14:02.256
Accessory to murder!

01:14:02.258 --> 01:14:05.176
Do you have any idea how
much money we're going to spend

01:14:05.178 --> 01:14:06.342
on legal fees?

01:14:06.344 --> 01:14:07.636
My classmates are being
slaughtered left and right,

01:14:07.638 --> 01:14:09.262
and all you two care about is
what the neighbors will think?

01:14:09.264 --> 01:14:10.263
That's enough!

01:14:10.265 --> 01:14:11.265
What's the use?!

01:14:11.267 --> 01:14:14.226
You don't even
listen to each other.

01:14:14.228 --> 01:14:15.226
Eric!

01:14:15.228 --> 01:14:16.229
Come back here!

01:15:16.249 --> 01:15:18.248
I don't understand you, Carol.

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:21.252
You're married to a
cop, for Christ's sake!

01:15:21.254 --> 01:15:23.169
You know damn well you can't
exhume a body

01:15:23.171 --> 01:15:25.256
without a court order,
and judges aren't exactly

01:15:25.258 --> 01:15:28.258
in the habit of issuing them
to high school teachers.

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.262
Criminal trespassing, grave
robbery, corruption of a minor.

01:15:32.264 --> 01:15:34.265
You still think we're
making all of this up?

01:15:34.267 --> 01:15:38.269
Even after your own men
confirmed what we found.

01:15:38.271 --> 01:15:41.187
The only thing that matters
now is that we have Eric

01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:43.231
to testify against Belter.

01:15:43.233 --> 01:15:44.315
No, we don't.

01:15:44.317 --> 01:15:47.235
His father just called, the
kid climbed out a window

01:15:47.237 --> 01:15:49.279
and took off in their SUV.

01:15:49.281 --> 01:15:51.282
I never should
have let him leave.

01:15:51.284 --> 01:15:55.160
Put another APB out,
this time for Eric.

01:15:55.162 --> 01:15:57.245
Dan just called in, he
found Belter and Slatter

01:15:57.247 --> 01:15:59.289
inside the girl's
bedroom, double homicide.

01:16:00.293 --> 01:16:02.959
Just get
Beelock over there, asap!

01:16:02.961 --> 01:16:04.211
Copy that.

01:16:04.213 --> 01:16:09.216
So much for your theory that
Gary was behind all of this.

01:16:09.218 --> 01:16:10.176
Maybe Eric...

01:16:10.178 --> 01:16:13.261
Eric was with me,
I'm Eric's alibi.

01:16:13.263 --> 01:16:15.263
He's running away and
we have to stop him.

01:16:15.265 --> 01:16:17.224
He isn't running away.

01:16:17.226 --> 01:16:19.267
He's going after Johnny.

01:16:19.269 --> 01:16:22.270
Look, your students are
being murdered left and right,

01:16:22.272 --> 01:16:25.231
it's only natural for you
to experience some kind

01:16:25.233 --> 01:16:27.150
of reaction to what's happening.

01:16:27.152 --> 01:16:31.279
Eric and I each saw Johnny
on two separate occasions.

01:16:31.281 --> 01:16:34.283
Is Eric having an emotional
breakdown too?

01:16:34.285 --> 01:16:38.203
The exact same emotional
breakdown?

01:16:38.205 --> 01:16:40.163
This whole town
has gone insane!

01:16:40.165 --> 01:16:42.208
He attacked me!

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.208
Who did?

01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:44.334
Johnny.

01:16:44.336 --> 01:16:48.254
He broke into our house
yesterday and he attacked me.

01:16:48.256 --> 01:16:50.216
I didn't want to tell you
because I knew

01:16:50.218 --> 01:16:54.177
you wouldn't believe me,
but it's true.

01:16:54.179 --> 01:16:56.221
What do you mean,
he attacked you?

01:16:56.223 --> 01:17:00.266
He came into our bathroom
and he put his filthy hands

01:17:00.268 --> 01:17:05.230
on me and he stuck his
rotting tongue in my mouth.

01:17:05.232 --> 01:17:07.274
Will you stop it?!

01:17:07.276 --> 01:17:10.276
Matt, please listen!

01:17:10.278 --> 01:17:13.196
Eric has gone after Johnny

01:17:13.198 --> 01:17:15.240
and we can't let
him do this alone!

01:17:15.242 --> 01:17:19.203
We have to help him
before it's too late.

01:17:52.237 --> 01:17:53.236
Johnny!

01:17:53.238 --> 01:17:57.240
I'm here, just like you wanted!

01:17:57.242 --> 01:18:02.245
Come get me, you son of a bitch!

01:18:46.209 --> 01:18:49.168
So it's true, they really
do return

01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:51.169
to the scene of the crime.

01:18:51.171 --> 01:18:52.296
I knew I'd find you here.

01:18:52.298 --> 01:18:55.257
We've always been on
the same wavelength, Eric.

01:18:55.259 --> 01:18:58.177
Sorry I'm late, I had
trouble starting my car.

01:18:58.179 --> 01:19:00.221
What the hell are you?

01:19:00.223 --> 01:19:03.265
I'm fucking pissed off!

01:19:03.267 --> 01:19:07.269
You have no idea how
much will power it takes

01:19:07.271 --> 01:19:09.230
to move even one fucking muscle

01:19:09.232 --> 01:19:11.231
when your spirit's left your
body.

01:19:11.233 --> 01:19:12.233
Yeah?

01:19:12.235 --> 01:19:15.235
So why bother?

01:19:15.237 --> 01:19:18.239
Because nothing's as
sweet as revenge, Eric.

01:19:18.241 --> 01:19:20.199
Not even sex.

01:19:20.201 --> 01:19:23.284
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

01:19:23.286 --> 01:19:25.287
Karen and Gary...

01:19:25.289 --> 01:19:29.166
I saved the best for last.

01:19:29.168 --> 01:19:31.209
Why me?

01:19:31.211 --> 01:19:34.212
Because you were my
best friend.

01:19:34.214 --> 01:19:36.172
So why go through with this?

01:19:36.174 --> 01:19:38.217
Because you're alive
and I'm not!

01:19:38.219 --> 01:19:40.177
It isn't fair!

01:19:40.179 --> 01:19:44.222
You tried to kill all of
us that night, right here!

01:19:44.224 --> 01:19:45.266
I was drunk!

01:19:45.268 --> 01:19:46.350
There's no excuse!

01:19:46.352 --> 01:19:49.270
You said yourself I
never would have done it!

01:19:49.272 --> 01:19:53.274
I'm not so sure now, after
you murdered five people.

01:19:53.276 --> 01:19:57.194
Well, I stopped giving
a fuck what you believe

01:19:57.196 --> 01:19:59.195
the night you helped
Gary dump my fucking body

01:19:59.197 --> 01:20:01.239
in this creek.

01:20:01.241 --> 01:20:04.243
Rhonda never did
anything to you!

01:20:04.245 --> 01:20:07.245
She's dead because
you loved her.

01:20:07.247 --> 01:20:08.247
That's the thought
that I want you

01:20:08.249 --> 01:20:11.208
to carry to your grave, Eric.

01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:14.252
She called out your name.

01:20:14.254 --> 01:20:19.216
She cried for you,
over and over.

01:20:19.218 --> 01:20:21.260
Where were you?

01:20:26.224 --> 01:20:29.267
You sure wiped
the smile off my face.

01:20:53.251 --> 01:20:57.253
You were supposed
to be my friend!

01:20:57.255 --> 01:20:59.256
You should have stopped him.

01:20:59.258 --> 01:21:01.217
You were supposed
to have my back!

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:03.260
I tried.

01:21:03.262 --> 01:21:05.261
Bullshit!

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.242
We've got to get down there!

01:21:31.249 --> 01:21:33.164
Eric!

01:21:39.214 --> 01:21:40.213
Eric!

01:21:40.215 --> 01:21:41.257
You're
all dead to me!

01:21:41.259 --> 01:21:43.175
Dead!

01:21:43.177 --> 01:21:44.260
I'm going to kill
every one of you.

01:21:47.264 --> 01:21:48.221
No!

01:21:48.223 --> 01:21:49.222
You might hit Eric.

01:21:49.224 --> 01:21:51.266
It's not my fault!

01:21:52.269 --> 01:21:53.269
Fuck you!

01:21:53.271 --> 01:21:55.270
It's isn't my fault,
you hear me?!

01:21:55.272 --> 01:21:57.273
It isn't my fault!

01:22:32.226 --> 01:22:33.225
Give me your hand.

01:22:33.227 --> 01:22:34.226
Give me your hand.

01:22:34.228 --> 01:22:41.275
That's it, I gotcha.

01:22:41.277 --> 01:22:43.276
I don't believe what I just saw.

01:22:43.278 --> 01:22:44.278
Neither do I.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.196
You did it!

01:23:40.253 --> 01:23:45.256
How the hell are
we going to explain this?

01:23:45.258 --> 01:23:49.217
Just don't drag
the creek for his body.

01:23:49.219 --> 01:23:51.805
Please destroy that
goddamn car.
