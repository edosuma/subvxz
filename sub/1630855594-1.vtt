31:14.609 --> 31:16.877
What will you do with your life
now you've quit college

31:16.979 --> 31:19.344
and thrown it all away?

31:19.446 --> 31:22.284
How will you ever
pick up the pieces?

31:27.058 --> 31:31.656
-I have a lot of ideas.
-Like what?

31:35.631 --> 31:40.401
A friend of mine said I could
come work with him in Utah.

31:41.136 --> 31:44.235
Southern Utah, in the desert.

31:44.337 --> 31:46.140
He's a river-rafting guide,

31:46.242 --> 31:49.811
so he'd teach me
how to raft down a river

31:49.913 --> 31:52.984
and I can become a guide.

31:53.086 --> 31:56.956
You know, for the tourists
that come into town.

31:59.222 --> 32:03.424
-Have you ever rafted before?
-No.

32:06.326 --> 32:08.559
And who's this friend of yours?

32:08.661 --> 32:13.402
Well, he's more of a friend
of a friend.

32:13.504 --> 32:17.334
Never talked to him in person,
but we've chatted online.

32:17.436 --> 32:21.442
ERIC: Hmm... I don't like it.

32:23.115 --> 32:26.579
It's as bad an idea
as quitting college.

32:27.718 --> 32:29.450
Even worse.

32:31.018 --> 32:32.354
(CHUCKLES)

32:37.793 --> 32:39.526
(LAUGHS)

32:39.628 --> 32:43.464
We came here for nothing.
Complete waste of our time.

32:47.136 --> 32:49.501
What do you want to do now?

32:49.603 --> 32:52.875
-What about the zoo?
-What about the zoo?

32:52.977 --> 32:55.408
-We could go there.
-Why?

32:55.511 --> 33:00.944
-You love the zoo.
-I loved it when I was 12.

33:01.046 --> 33:03.317
MAGGIE: I'd be willing to go to
the zoo if you really want to.

33:03.419 --> 33:05.717
ERIC: Forget it.
It was just a stupid idea.

33:19.637 --> 33:21.304
(SIGHS)

33:34.052 --> 33:37.051
MAGGIE: "Hello, emu,
how are you?

33:37.153 --> 33:40.824
What are things you like to do?

33:40.926 --> 33:43.661
I like to eat big giant bugs.

33:43.763 --> 33:46.224
I like eating slimy slugs.

33:46.326 --> 33:48.798
I like to chase the bees.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.997
I like to pee on trees.

33:51.099 --> 33:53.098
Emu, emu. That is I.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.539
Sadly I cannot fly.

33:55.641 --> 33:57.609
Emu, emu. E-M-U.

33:57.711 --> 34:00.376
I am me and you are you."

34:01.177 --> 34:02.309
Written and first performed

34:02.411 --> 34:04.210
in this very zoo
many, many years ago.

34:04.312 --> 34:05.711
It's a masterpiece, really.

34:05.847 --> 34:09.352
-One for the books, I'd say.
-Well, how can it be denied?

34:18.591 --> 34:20.030
MAN:<i> ...at the top of the tree</i>

34:20.132 --> 34:21.897
<i> and hang out</i>
<i> in that tree all day</i>

34:21.999 --> 34:23.232
and just munch on bamboo.

34:23.335 --> 34:25.000
They don't have
a lot of predators in the wild,

34:25.102 --> 34:26.566
so their lives are pretty quiet

34:26.668 --> 34:29.201
and they don't have a lot
of things to worry about

34:29.303 --> 34:30.403
when they're out there.

34:30.505 --> 34:33.205
These guys live in Nepal
and in India,

34:33.307 --> 34:36.441
Bhutan, Myanmar and China.

34:36.543 --> 34:38.742
Their main food source
is bamboo.

34:38.845 --> 34:40.579
That's one of the reasons
they're endangered

34:40.681 --> 34:43.414
because those forests
are being cut down.

34:43.516 --> 34:45.487
Jude will eat little treats.

35:03.437 --> 35:04.569
Why would you just wander off

35:04.671 --> 35:06.277
without telling us
where you're going,

35:06.379 --> 35:08.243
especially when you're doing
some kind of digital detox

35:08.345 --> 35:10.814
and you don't have
a phone with you?

35:10.916 --> 35:12.581
Why would you do that?

35:12.683 --> 35:16.518
-Maybe she had a panic attack.
-Does Maggie have panic attacks?

35:16.620 --> 35:19.221
I thought you talked to her
on the phone sometimes.

35:19.323 --> 35:21.518
Yeah, but she never
told me that.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.595
Why is she having panic attacks?

35:23.697 --> 35:25.692
Just normal anxiety.

35:33.607 --> 35:35.873
Do you not...

35:35.975 --> 35:38.309
-have panic attacks?
-No.

35:41.710 --> 35:44.643
Well, since you don't keep up
on the books,

35:44.745 --> 35:47.445
both of your sisters
have panic attacks,

35:47.547 --> 35:49.450
your mother had panic attacks,

35:49.552 --> 35:51.889
maybe even your father
had panic attacks,

35:51.991 --> 35:53.290
although nobody would know that

35:53.392 --> 35:55.588
because he never confessed
to any other living soul

35:55.691 --> 35:58.659
about what was going on
inside his mind or body.

36:01.901 --> 36:03.335
So consider yourself lucky

36:03.437 --> 36:06.898
to have skipped the genetic
chopping block on that one.

36:11.774 --> 36:16.347
You running out of time?
You need to go see your friends?

36:18.918 --> 36:21.352
I have about two hours.

36:28.060 --> 36:30.359
Thank you, Eric, for sacrificing

36:30.461 --> 36:33.424
so much of yourself to us
this weekend.

36:33.526 --> 36:35.564
It's very kind of you.

36:38.336 --> 36:39.997
But next time,
if there<i> is</i> a next time,

36:40.099 --> 36:43.100
you know, another three years
from now or whatever,

36:43.202 --> 36:46.573
would you consider sacrificing
maybe even more of yourself

36:46.676 --> 36:50.015
and spend, like,
actual full days with Maggie?

36:50.117 --> 36:51.476
Like, you come here
and you feed us

36:51.578 --> 36:52.844
minutes and hours at your will,

36:52.946 --> 36:55.920
like giving tiny breadcrumbs
to starving mice,

36:56.022 --> 36:57.484
and it breaks her little heart.

36:57.586 --> 37:00.259
She thinks she needs you
for some reason.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.226
When did this start?
You being like this?

37:05.328 --> 37:07.530
-Being like what?
-Mean.

37:10.168 --> 37:11.634
Haven't I always been like this?

37:11.736 --> 37:15.671
No. You've been funny and witty
and cynical about the world,

37:15.773 --> 37:19.740
but you've never been cruel,
this bitter, not like this.

37:26.419 --> 37:29.882
Maybe I've just been jaded
by age and experience.

37:31.158 --> 37:32.990
Because of what happened
with Nathan?

37:33.092 --> 37:35.459
(SCOFFS) Fucking seriously?

37:35.561 --> 37:39.293
That is the kind of math
that goes through your head?

37:39.395 --> 37:40.993
Bitter-and-mean woman equals

37:41.095 --> 37:45.766
must-be-scorned-by-cheating-
ex-boyfriend woman? Fuck off.

37:53.810 --> 37:56.346
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry that happened to you.

37:56.449 --> 37:58.983
I didn't know
Nathan was that kind of person.

37:59.085 --> 38:00.451
Yeah, I know you liked him,

38:00.553 --> 38:03.184
so sorry you don't get
to hang out with him anymore.

38:03.286 --> 38:04.553
We can track him down

38:04.655 --> 38:06.825
and I'll beat the shit out
of him if you want.

38:06.927 --> 38:08.118
(LAUGHS) Like you could.

38:08.220 --> 38:11.462
You don't think I would win
in a fight against Nathan?

38:25.542 --> 38:27.445
ERIC:<i> You sure</i>
<i> you're feeling OK?</i>

38:30.145 --> 38:31.547
Yeah.

38:31.649 --> 38:35.082
Can we just stay here
for a couple more minutes?

38:35.184 --> 38:36.784
ERIC: Of course.

38:45.630 --> 38:49.126
Do you want water,
candy, soda or something?

38:50.098 --> 38:51.502
No.

39:01.747 --> 39:05.549
How about a little of the old
"Looking At You Looking At Me"?

39:07.317 --> 39:09.718
Maybe "Bathtub Blues"?

39:11.157 --> 39:13.051
"I've Got Rainbows On My Mind"?

39:17.394 --> 39:19.629

-Well played.
-Elite status.

40:55.390 --> 40:56.625
You deserve it.

40:56.728 --> 40:58.223
Yeah, I mean, I couldn't
in my conscience leave

40:58.325 --> 41:01.231
without seeing if I could win
against you all in a tournament.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.101
You're a great player, for sure.

41:03.203 --> 41:05.798
Probably better than any of us.

41:05.900 --> 41:07.999
You think he's as good
as Christina?

41:08.102 --> 41:10.938
-Hmm. That's a tough one.
-Who's Christina?

41:11.040 --> 41:13.872
She's our best player.
She beats us most of the time.

41:13.974 --> 41:16.611
I mean, she usually
slaughters us.

41:16.713 --> 41:18.482
She was out of town
this weekend.

41:18.584 --> 41:21.448
I'd like to see
if you could beat Christina.

41:21.550 --> 41:23.048
She's amazingly good.

41:23.150 --> 41:25.357
Next time you're in town,
let's make it happen.

41:25.459 --> 41:28.258
-Yeah, thanks. Good game.
-Yeah. You too.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.690
When is Christina back in town?

41:29.792 --> 41:32.294
Um, she's just visiting
her parents.

41:32.396 --> 41:34.533
I think tomorrow morning.

41:35.032 --> 41:36.194

we don't use
because it's too sentimental.

just imagine it
without this section.

43:30.713 --> 43:32.915
Everything flows much better.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.752
What if we just trim it?

What if I cut it

47:14.471 --> 47:15.874
Well?

47:24.449 --> 47:26.016
I'll miss you.

47:26.951 --> 47:29.784
Earlier when we were
with everybody

47:29.886 --> 47:33.056
and I did the, uh, radio voice

47:33.158 --> 47:36.895
about the earthquake
and the baby, you didn't laugh.

47:37.596 --> 47:39.293
Nobody else did either.

47:40.699 --> 47:43.033
Was it because of my delivery?

47:45.569 --> 47:47.367
I don't know.

47:47.469 --> 47:51.910
Or was it in comparison
with what Rachel was saying?

47:54.544 --> 47:56.046
Maybe.

48:05.884 --> 48:09.191
You used to think I was the
funniest person in the world.

48:18.433 --> 48:21.404
You're really not going
to stay another night?

48:21.506 --> 48:23.073
Probably not.

48:38.085 --> 48:41.250
I think I was, like, six.

48:41.352 --> 48:42.585
My mom was cooking dinner

48:42.688 --> 48:45.260
and she sliced her finger open
with a knife.

48:45.362 --> 48:48.197
I saw all the blood and I saw
how freaked out she was.

48:48.299 --> 48:51.065
Like, there was a real look
of terror on her face.

48:51.167 --> 48:52.596
Her finger was dangling
the wrong way.

48:52.698 --> 48:54.798
She went to the hospital,
she got it stitched up,

48:54.900 --> 48:59.303
but I totally thought she was
gonna die while she was there.

48:59.405 --> 49:01.206
-Good hand.
-ERIC: Thank you.

49:01.308 --> 49:03.345
DENNIS:
And what about you, Eric?

49:03.447 --> 49:08.115
First time you realized that
death exists and people die.

49:08.217 --> 49:09.814
ERIC:
That's what we're talking about?

49:09.916 --> 49:11.550
Yeah.

49:13.425 --> 49:14.993
Um...

49:17.295 --> 49:22.528
I remember... there was
this father and son I once knew.

49:22.630 --> 49:27.104
And, uh, the father was,
like, pretty high up in status,

49:27.206 --> 49:30.841
like, he had most of the power
in their community.

49:30.943 --> 49:32.942
And the father
was planning on the son

49:33.044 --> 49:34.838
taking over for him,
for the father,

49:34.940 --> 49:38.146
like, taking over what you
could call the family business.

49:38.248 --> 49:42.112
But the son's uncle,
the father's brother,

49:42.214 --> 49:44.581
he wanted the power.

49:44.683 --> 49:48.758
He was jealous and mean,
the uncle, and...

49:48.860 --> 49:50.887
so the evil uncle made a trap

49:50.989 --> 49:55.932
cornering the father in this,
like, canyon, in a canyon,

49:56.034 --> 49:58.569
where there was
a stampede of antelope.

49:58.671 --> 49:59.629
-Antelope?
-ERIC: Yeah.

49:59.731 --> 50:02.699
Like, very strong antelope
or strong deer.

50:02.801 --> 50:05.074
I don't know. But animals
that look like antelope,

50:05.176 --> 50:07.010
and the father was trapped
and he was hurt,

50:07.112 --> 50:11.313
and he tried
to climb up the canyon wall.

50:12.916 --> 50:14.646
But the uncle was there.

50:17.121 --> 50:21.653
Uh, he didn't let the father
climb up.

50:23.158 --> 50:25.125
He, uh... And the father fell.

50:25.227 --> 50:28.198
He fell back down
into the canyon.

50:29.062 --> 50:31.069
And, um...

50:32.431 --> 50:35.238
He, uh... That's how he died.

50:35.340 --> 50:39.842
And the son, he went down there
wondering what happened,

50:39.944 --> 50:41.738
and he found his father dead.

50:41.840 --> 50:44.308
The son was so sad,
he was trying to understand

50:44.410 --> 50:46.348
what happened to his father.

50:48.781 --> 50:52.090
And understand
why his father wasn't moving.

50:53.156 --> 50:57.095
Um, and his father
was indeed dead.

50:58.294 --> 51:01.060
And that was the first time
I realized

51:01.162 --> 51:03.563
that sometimes, lions die.

51:05.472 --> 51:06.938
(LAUGHTER)

51:07.040 --> 51:09.701
DENNIS: Oh, my God, Eric,
you're crazy.

51:11.138 --> 51:13.771
WOMAN: Ooh! (LAUGHS)

51:14.539 --> 51:15.811
JOSH: Wait. I... I don't get it.

51:15.913 --> 51:17.675
What's going on? What?

51:17.777 --> 51:21.310
The son that found
the father dead, that was Simba

51:21.412 --> 51:23.346
from<i> The Lion King.</i>

51:23.448 --> 51:24.681
Like, the Disney movie?

51:24.784 --> 51:28.159
-WOMAN: Yeah.
-JOSH: All right. OK, I get it.

51:28.261 --> 51:30.689
Like, you got us, man.
You got us pretty good there.

51:30.791 --> 51:33.161
That's really the first time
you realized people die?

51:33.263 --> 51:35.061
Yeah, that tore me apart,
that scene.

51:35.163 --> 51:36.430
Basically traumatized me.

51:36.532 --> 51:39.095
I guess you could say
it<i> scarred </i> me for life.

51:39.197 --> 51:41.432
(LAUGHS)

51:41.534 --> 51:43.806
Scar is the name
of the evil uncle.

51:43.908 --> 51:45.501
Eric was scarred for life.

51:45.604 --> 51:47.673
-I got you. All right.
-Yeah.

51:47.775 --> 51:50.607
-Why were you crying?
-I was trying to sell it to you.

51:50.709 --> 51:52.281
I was trying to sell the story
to you.

51:52.383 --> 51:54.445
DENNIS: Well, you sold it.
I almost cried too.

51:54.547 --> 51:57.749
-WOMAN: Hilarious.
-JOSH: Wow.

52:02.155 --> 52:04.756
(WATER RUNS)

52:14.700 --> 52:16.938
Eric, I don't think
you'd do half bad

52:17.040 --> 52:19.571
in another game I play in.

52:19.673 --> 52:22.345
It's a bigger game.
Cash game, good players.

52:22.447 --> 52:24.414
Three times a week, and there's
a game tomorrow night.

52:24.516 --> 52:29.213
I probably play twice a month,
if I feel like I can afford it.

52:29.315 --> 52:30.380
What's the buy-in?

52:30.482 --> 52:31.682
I don't think it'd be wise

52:31.784 --> 52:33.289
to start with anything less
than a hundred.

52:33.391 --> 52:35.787
But you're better off
with, like, two or three.

52:37.793 --> 52:41.691
I should be going home, finally.
But that's tempting, for sure.

52:41.793 --> 52:44.427
All right. If you
change your mind,

52:44.529 --> 52:47.267
Megan's got my number.

52:47.369 --> 52:48.969
-Bye, Megan.
-All right, Megan.

52:49.071 --> 52:50.637

Moopie-Moopie crawled back

54:47.523 --> 54:50.189
inside her warm
little hiding place.

54:50.291 --> 54:51.659
She is very tired.

54:51.761 --> 54:54.063
If there's any chance
of her coming back out to play,

54:54.165 --> 54:56.530
she needs a 16-ounce coffee

54:56.633 --> 55:01.036
and perhaps a delicious pastry
of some sort.

55:08.912 --> 55:10.809
Hm-hmm.

55:10.911 --> 55:15.285
Charles went home
because he doesn't want to play.

55:15.387 --> 55:18.954
But Charles said
he was going home before,

55:19.056 --> 55:20.457
and he didn't do it.

55:20.559 --> 55:25.726
Well, I think this time,
Charles has left us far behind.

55:25.828 --> 55:28.559
Sorry about that but, you know,
Charles is an adult.

55:28.661 --> 55:31.631
Charles can do what he wants.

Hang on. You are ahead of me.

make that bet?

I could just walk away now

about what I've won.

the smart thing to do.

If you think about it
hard enough,

01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:22.752
it's the very reason
why you exist, Wug-Wug.

01:15:22.854 --> 01:15:25.261
And why I do. Moopie-Moopie.

01:15:25.363 --> 01:15:27.893
I was born
because Charles thought

01:15:27.995 --> 01:15:30.764
he was the smartest man
on the face of the earth.

01:15:30.866 --> 01:15:32.999
You and I, Wug-Wug,
we brought ourselves forth

01:15:33.101 --> 01:15:36.199
to show him that there were
other flavors in the universe,

01:15:36.301 --> 01:15:40.275
that it wasn't all Charleses
and Randy Roundabouts.

01:15:40.377 --> 01:15:41.839
That there were other creatures

01:15:41.941 --> 01:15:43.976
even more awesome
and more hilarious

01:15:44.078 --> 01:15:48.416
than that which existed
in his limited imagination.

01:15:48.518 --> 01:15:50.618
(AS CHARLES)
Speaking of limited,

01:15:50.721 --> 01:15:53.650
Moopie-Moopie's story
is simply very one-sided

01:15:53.752 --> 01:15:55.587
and... and not very true.

01:15:55.689 --> 01:15:57.188
'Tis Moopie-Moopie who decided

01:15:57.290 --> 01:16:01.697
that she was more awesome
and hilarious than anybody else,

01:16:01.799 --> 01:16:05.599
and it was she who decided
to make you, Wug-Wug, know

01:16:05.701 --> 01:16:07.863
that she was
that much more awesome

01:16:07.965 --> 01:16:09.837
and hilarious than me, Charles.

01:16:09.939 --> 01:16:13.039
(VALLEY GIRL VOICE) Hey,
this is Tina from the Valley.

We're at a party right now,
so maybe we should just party.

Oh, wow, this is, like,
a furry blanket, isn't it?

01:16:32.663 --> 01:16:35.060
-It's so furry.
-AMANDA: Yeah, I like it.

01:16:35.162 --> 01:16:38.530
-That's why I bought it.
-ERIC: Yeah. What is it, sheep?

01:16:38.632 --> 01:16:41.264
AMANDA: I think it's fake.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.779
It's incredible.

01:16:59.117 --> 01:17:02.120
I think I'm gonna go
back downstairs.

01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:15.871
What am I doing here?

01:17:15.973 --> 01:17:19.707
Are you asking yourself that
question, or are you asking me?

01:17:19.809 --> 01:17:22.679
If you have an answer,
I'd love to hear.

I'm definitely leaving

I think about you sometimes.

Do you really?

01:24:17.927 --> 01:24:19.854
Do you think I don't love you?

or yeah, you think I love you?

I don't know. I think
you loved me a long time ago.
