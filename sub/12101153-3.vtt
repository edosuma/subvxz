00:01.523 --> 00:03.220
<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:03.264 --> 00:06.441
If you're gonna save your world
you have to work
with Lex Luthor.

00:06.484 --> 00:07.920
I'm just gonna kill Supergirl
myself.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.228
I won.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.535
Silas, we want you to help us
break into the Phantom Zone.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.363
The portals only open
and close long enough

00:15.406 --> 00:17.060
for a Phantom to get through.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.670
Then I guess we're gonna have
to catch a Phantom.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.411
<i>We find the defendant
not guilty.</i>

00:20.455 --> 00:22.065
The Phantom Zone's been
fractured,

00:22.109 --> 00:24.024
it would take years for us to
make it to each of them.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.112
Supergirl is in there, okay?

00:25.155 --> 00:26.896
We are bringing her home.

00:26.939 --> 00:29.116
I think the Phantom did
something to me. Please come.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.341
Silas.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.690
It's freezing in here.

00:39.474 --> 00:40.301
Found him.

00:42.172 --> 00:45.088
What happened?

00:45.132 --> 00:48.178
A Phantom. It burst out of me
and attacked me.

00:48.222 --> 00:51.486
It was so cold, worse than
I can ever imagine.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.054
Like living death.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.447
We didn't send all the Phantoms
back to the Phantom Zone.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.364
One got out.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.548
You ready to catch a ride?

01:20.993 --> 01:23.083
-Kara.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.438
Get him.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.831
No, let her go!

01:32.875 --> 01:35.486
Kara, Kara, Kara!

01:36.313 --> 01:38.402
Father...

01:38.446 --> 01:40.970
No, stop! Stop! Bring him back.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.146
-Quiet.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.626
It'll hear you.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.280
Who'll hear me?
Where are they taking him?

01:46.323 --> 01:47.803
Same place we're taking you.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.152
Don't touch me.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.153
You gotta get out of here.

01:51.589 --> 01:54.288
Phantoms, over the ridge,
coming this way.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.681
They just tore through
a bunch of White Martians,

01:56.725 --> 01:58.292
now they're on the rampage too.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.772
-Why should I believe you?
-Because they got Az-Rel.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.342
That was all
that was left of him.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.477
Oh, no, they're here.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.358
That was too easy.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.751
There are no Phantoms
or White Martians

02:22.794 --> 02:24.100
coming over the ridge,
are there?

02:27.234 --> 02:30.324
-And Az-Rel?
-Oh, he's fine,

02:30.367 --> 02:31.977
wherever he is.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.763
I nicked this from him
weeks ago.

02:34.806 --> 02:37.200
Girl's gotta light a fire
somehow.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.203
Thank you,
but they took my father.
I have to go rescue him.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.292
-You will.

02:42.336 --> 02:46.644
But first, we have to get you
and that leg somewhere safe.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.696
Come with me.

03:00.571 --> 03:01.572
All right.

03:04.575 --> 03:06.273
It's all right.

03:06.316 --> 03:09.537
Where are you, Supergirl?
You're in here somewhere.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.975
In the dark and in the cold.

03:13.628 --> 03:16.239
All alone...

03:16.283 --> 03:18.720
<i>I'm here with
Lex Luthor. How does it feel
to be a free man?</i>

03:18.763 --> 03:21.070
<i>Um, in a word, beautiful.</i>

03:21.113 --> 03:23.594
Well, Rhonda, it feels wrong.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.075
Because I'm a madman who should
be rotting in prison.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.598
<i>...jury, I wanna say thank you.</i>

03:27.642 --> 03:29.557
<i>Without you, my future
wouldn't be so bright.</i>

03:29.600 --> 03:31.341
You shouldn't have a future.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.822
You shouldn't even be able to
sleep at night.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.911
You should be haunted

03:35.954 --> 03:40.742
by a Kryptonian heart beating
ceaselessly beneath your
floorboards!

03:40.785 --> 03:44.398
Brainy! Alex!
We need thermal blankets.

03:44.441 --> 03:47.357
-It's okay, it's okay.
-What happened to him?

03:47.401 --> 03:50.839
A Phantom slipped by us last
night. It attacked Silas.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.275
How did it get by us?

03:52.319 --> 03:54.103
It nested inside of him.

03:54.146 --> 03:56.932
But if it escaped him,
why attack?

03:56.975 --> 04:00.588
I have three roommates,
I don't know where they are.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.111
It's okay, it's okay.
We'll find them.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.591
Brainy, get me everything you
can on Phantoms.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.201
We didn't know they could
possess humans,

04:05.245 --> 04:06.942
what what else don't we
know about them?

04:06.985 --> 04:08.160
I'm so cold.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.076
Where's Alex and Dreamer?

04:11.120 --> 04:13.209
Nia was pulled for
Catco's investor's retreat.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.777
Andrea wouldn't let her say no,
she has to replace Kara.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.214
Alex went home last night
to get some rest.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.911
I need her here.
This man needs help.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.482
Go easy on her.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.310
She was crushed when
we couldn't save Supergirl
from the Phantom Zone.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.399
So was I.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.967
But you were the one who
reminded me to act like a
soldier not a father.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.535
Alex needs to do
the same right now.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.711
You both need to be honest
with your emotions...

04:36.754 --> 04:38.974
I acted on my emotions
yesterday.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.846
And not only did we fail
to save Supergirl,

04:41.890 --> 04:44.719
but I let a Phantom escape
into this world.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.503
I won't make
the same mistake again.

04:49.985 --> 04:52.466
<i>When I landed on Earth,
I was alone.</i>

04:52.509 --> 04:54.772
<i>My adoptive mother raised me
as her own,</i>

04:54.816 --> 04:57.558
<i>with kindness and compassion.</i>

04:57.601 --> 05:02.824
<i>And my sister, she showed
me what it truly means to
be strong.</i>

05:02.867 --> 05:05.914
<i>To love so fiercely, it hurts.</i>

05:05.957 --> 05:08.308
<i>She taught me
what it means to be human.</i>

05:10.005 --> 05:12.355
<i>She was my first companion
on this planet.</i>

05:14.618 --> 05:17.491
<i>Without her, I wouldn't be
the hero, the person
I am today.</i>

05:17.534 --> 05:18.883
I thought you weren't going
to watch that.

05:18.927 --> 05:19.971
<i>I am Kara Zor-El.</i>

05:21.930 --> 05:24.976
That's before I thought
she wasn't really gone.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.151
Hey...

05:27.675 --> 05:29.198
Kara is not dead.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.026
No, it's worse than death.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.770
She's trapped in a cold hell...

05:35.813 --> 05:37.424
because I couldn't save her.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.906
So, what's...

05:42.951 --> 05:45.257
What's my purpose now?

05:45.301 --> 05:47.259
What's the point of
trying anything else?

05:47.825 --> 05:50.175
Baby...

05:50.219 --> 05:54.745
Loss is different for everyone,
but it hurts the same.

05:56.094 --> 05:59.402
And I will sit with you,
right here.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.016
I can't breathe.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.673
I feel like
I don't even deserve air...

06:12.459 --> 06:14.678
It's J'onn.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.637
I know what
you're going to say,

06:16.680 --> 06:19.161
but it doesn't matter if I pick
up the phone or not, there's...

06:19.204 --> 06:20.858
There's no point.

06:22.425 --> 06:27.387
The point is
that you're still here.

06:27.430 --> 06:31.652
And you get to decide whether
you give up or you keep going.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.091
Look, I know it's not
the same thing

06:36.134 --> 06:40.225
but yesterday,
when I was in my own despair

06:40.269 --> 06:44.273
about what happened at
Obsidian...

06:44.316 --> 06:49.887
I lost my way and I found a
lifeline in helping Silas find
his.

06:49.931 --> 06:53.108
Because when everything seems
dark,

06:53.151 --> 06:56.111
that's when we show up
for those who need us the most.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.470
Thoroughly unpleasant surprise.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.690
Good morning, sis.
I promise this'll be quick.

07:09.733 --> 07:13.171
When I woke up this morning, I
could not wait to get back to
work.

07:13.215 --> 07:16.261
So, I opened my computer and,
wouldn't you know it,

07:16.305 --> 07:19.569
I have been locked out of
all Luthor Corp accounts.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.659
Even my own Lex Foundation,
isn't that funny?

07:22.703 --> 07:26.707
You may be a free man,
Lex, but your time
at Luthor Corp is over.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.012
Ah-ha-ha!

07:28.056 --> 07:29.884
See,
I had a feeling it was you.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.495
The firewalls were spectacular,
by the way.

07:32.539 --> 07:35.237
And how did you change my
bioscan?

07:35.280 --> 07:38.327
Ah, let me guess,
the Coluan helped
you out with that?

07:38.370 --> 07:40.851
Cute prank, sis. Now, undo it.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.160
Maybe I wasn't clear,

07:45.203 --> 07:49.294
I will do everything
in my power
to protect this company

07:49.338 --> 07:51.209
and the world from you.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.473
Do you think my testimony was
some kind of a mistake?

07:53.516 --> 07:56.998
Hmm. I thought you might be
feeling stubborn.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.305
I had very expensive coffee
this morning

08:00.349 --> 08:03.221
with my new friend
ADA Matthews,

08:03.265 --> 08:05.659
now District Attorney Matthews.

08:05.702 --> 08:09.576
He was freshly appointed when
your friend, District Attorney
Diaz,

08:09.619 --> 08:13.057
was fired for losing my case.

08:13.101 --> 08:16.974
Anyway, uh, Mr. Matthews was so
grateful at his good fortune,

08:17.018 --> 08:19.020
that he's willing to do me a
favor.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.674
He's issuing you a court order

08:20.717 --> 08:24.373
to undo your little
cyber-attack within the hour.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.593
Oh, and I also had
a very nice chat with him

08:26.636 --> 08:30.597
about his investigation into
you and Non Nocere.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.164
Just wanted to make sure he was
giving it his full attention.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.992
It's now his number one
priority.

08:35.036 --> 08:38.387
Be wary of opening with
the Queen's Gambit, sis.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.084
It's such
an obvious first move.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.740
-This isn't over.
-It never is.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.005
You said
a Phantom did this?
Yeah.

08:48.049 --> 08:51.400
Or as they are
originally known,
a Zulian Melatarian.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.884
Originally from a dark planet
on the outskirts
of the Roa system,

08:56.927 --> 09:00.017
they were forced to flee,
seeking a new home planet to
repopulate.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.106
Unfortunately,
their method of populating

09:02.150 --> 09:03.978
is to infect the planet's
existing inhabitants

09:04.021 --> 09:06.589
by turning them into soulless,
hive-minded, minions.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.852
They were very successful.

09:08.896 --> 09:13.509
Until the Kryptonians stopped
them, imprisoned them in the
Phantom Zone.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.731
Their powers were diluted and
they were unable to multiply.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.777
They were, however, able to
continue spreading misery,

09:20.821 --> 09:22.431
making them excellent prison
guards.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.912
But when this alien escaped,
all its powers returned.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.044
It can now infect people?

09:27.088 --> 09:28.785
Essentially, make new Phantoms?

09:28.829 --> 09:31.266
And it only gets stronger,
the more it preys.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.268
Will it possess people like
Silas?

09:33.311 --> 09:36.619
No, I believe that was purely
a means of escape and evasion.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.100
When the Phantoms attack,
first they do so psychically,

09:39.143 --> 09:40.754
paralyzing their prey
with misery.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.973
Then they strike using
their venomous talons.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.498
After a short incubation
period, the victim's life-force
leaves the body

09:46.542 --> 09:48.413
and migrates to the Phantom's
nest.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.241
-Life-force?
-In the 31st century,

09:50.285 --> 09:52.679
we discovered a formula to
quantify

09:52.722 --> 09:55.072
the intangible substance
that makes a human unique.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.639
You call it a soul.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.904
Temperature is crashing.

10:03.515 --> 10:04.908
What was that?

10:43.555 --> 10:44.731
That's Silas?

10:44.774 --> 10:47.081
And a Phantom's attack
did this?

10:47.124 --> 10:48.560
Yes.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.519
And with that Phantom still on
the loose,

10:50.562 --> 10:52.173
it could be infecting other
victims.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.391
We need to find that Phantom

10:53.435 --> 10:55.002
and anyone he may have turned.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
M'gann, you and I will keep
searching the city,

10:56.743 --> 10:58.701
scanning for cold-energy
signatures.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.529
We can use Silas
as a baseline template.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.749
Brainy, get into Silas's
social media,

11:02.792 --> 11:04.359
scan for facial recognition.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.187
We need to find
those roommates.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.276
What do we do
if they've already been turned?

11:08.319 --> 11:09.669
Act very carefully.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.759
These progeny

11:12.802 --> 11:15.675
will be just as powerful as the
Phantom, but they're still
innocent people.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.852
A remote activated kinetic
inhibitor can be triggered from
up to a mile away.

11:18.895 --> 11:22.029
Keeping us at a safe distance
so that we don't also
become infected.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.726
I'll begin constructing one now

11:23.770 --> 11:26.033
along with some additional
Phantom containment units.

11:26.076 --> 11:29.427
Good. Until then,
we need to locate that Phantom

11:29.471 --> 11:30.777
and keep everybody safe.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.442
Look, I know
you're upset right now.

11:44.486 --> 11:48.098
Not getting Kara back
was a blow
none of us expected.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.797
But we can't be ruled by our
emotions. Not now.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.321
I need you to focus
and lean into your training.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.106
Because that's exactly
what it's for,

11:56.150 --> 11:58.543
to kick in when we feel like
giving up.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.937
So we find comfort in doing
what we do best.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.941
Kara is gone.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.858
How can you just march on
like nothing is wrong?

12:08.902 --> 12:10.860
Because marching
is the only way
to get her back.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.605
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

12:16.648 --> 12:17.998
My father was safe
where he was.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.782
I never should've convinced him
to leave.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.611
So I have good news and bad
news.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.744
Let's start with the bad news
first.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.094
I like to end on a high note.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.706
Those guys that took your
father,

12:30.750 --> 12:32.926
they're going to sacrifice him
to a terrible creature

12:32.969 --> 12:34.666
that lives deep in Shadow Lake.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.277
-What?
-But

12:36.320 --> 12:38.496
it doesn't feed until it's
lapped the lake 11 times.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.890
Which gives us enough time to
make a plan.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.458
No, I can't waste
any more time.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.852
You really should
let me make you a splint.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.941
Things don't heal
in the Phantom Zone.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.072
Like, ever.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.857
I can push through.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.555
You are stubborn.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.776
You must've made one hell of a
criminal.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.081
I'm not a criminal.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.648
Sure.

12:59.691 --> 13:00.954
And I'm a princess.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.043
I was sent here by a madman.

13:03.086 --> 13:07.177
And your father?
Did this madman
send him here too?

13:07.221 --> 13:09.353
Until yesterday,
I thought my father was dead.

13:10.877 --> 13:11.834
Why?

13:15.142 --> 13:18.101
My name is Kara Zor-El.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.974
When I was younger,
my home planet was dying.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.627
Saving it was hopeless.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.066
My father sent me to Earth

13:26.109 --> 13:29.025
to take care of my baby cousin
who went before me...

13:32.072 --> 13:36.163
and I thought we were the
only two survivors

13:36.206 --> 13:38.295
and that everyone else from our
planet was dead.

13:40.689 --> 13:41.864
Including my father.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.651
I can't lose him again.

13:48.523 --> 13:49.785
I think I can help.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.537
What's that?

14:02.580 --> 14:04.844
It's a powerful tool
from my dimension.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.498
I had it hidden on me
when I was banished.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.588
I may not have my powers here,

14:10.632 --> 14:13.765
but this thing still has
a few sparks.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.860
See, he's okay.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.776
Are you
a Fifth-Dimensional imp?

14:26.126 --> 14:27.475
Do you know many imps?

14:27.518 --> 14:30.347
Just one. His name is Mxyzptlk.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.612
You know Mxy?

14:34.656 --> 14:36.440
That guy is wild card.

14:36.484 --> 14:40.444
He has made some good strides
recently.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.446
At least he had the last time I
saw him.

14:44.753 --> 14:47.060
Yeah, maybe I could use that
splint, after all.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.895
J'onn, I was thinking.

14:55.938 --> 14:59.899
Maybe waiting for Brainy's
kinetic inhibitor to be ready
is risky.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.640
These Phantoms could be
multiplying at very high rates.

15:02.684 --> 15:05.948
If we find them, we should
contain them
any any way that we can.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.124
Absolutely not.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.822
Those energy field discs
require close proximity
to your target to work.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.346
You heard Brainy.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.825
The kinetic inhibitor
shields us by a mile.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.784
-But the longer we wait--
-I said no.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.091
That's an order, M'gann.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.971
Sorry it took me so long to get
here.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.669
There's a bit of an emergency
at the Tower.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.584
You're hologram multitasking
again.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.457
Your text said you need more
help with Operation Vengeance.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.806
I'm at your service.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.982
How did Lex take our systems
lockout?

15:40.026 --> 15:41.853
Poorly, as expected.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.248
He mentioned Lex's Foundation
this morning.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.511
So I did some digging and it
turns out

15:47.555 --> 15:50.471
the foundation is just a sham
to buy experimental weapons
from Kaznia,

15:50.514 --> 15:52.734
but you and I are going to
funnel the money directly

15:52.777 --> 15:56.346
to the Luthor Wing of National
City Children's Hospital
instead.

15:56.390 --> 15:59.132
Do you think you can hack into
this account and make that
happen?

15:59.175 --> 16:02.178
I'm not exaggerating when I say
that nothing would delight me
more.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.530
It's done.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.141
Lex should be receiving lavish
thank you calls

16:08.184 --> 16:10.186
from the hospital any minute.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.884
I have to go.

16:17.063 --> 16:20.022
He started running into the
south wall over and over again.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.111
Like he's being drawn to
something.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.505
I got a hit on the police
scanner.

16:24.548 --> 16:28.030
It says that there is a
disturbance at a warehouse two
miles south from here.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.859
It's being attacked
by hostile ghost creatures.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.383
The Phantom has a created new
progeny.

16:33.427 --> 16:36.169
We have to secure that
warehouse. Keep everybody from
the area.

16:37.561 --> 16:38.954
Where is M'gann?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.216
She said that she was going on
patrol.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.396
She's already there.

16:50.226 --> 16:53.447
I've got four cold signatures
immobile along the back wall.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.624
And one very large presence.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.106
The Phantom!

17:02.717 --> 17:03.935
M'gann!

17:06.199 --> 17:07.678
M'gann! No!

17:08.592 --> 17:09.854
M'gann!

17:11.595 --> 17:12.988
M'gann!

17:17.123 --> 17:19.342
The four progeny are in
containment,

17:19.386 --> 17:21.692
but their combined dark-phantom
energy is shorting the security
system.

17:21.736 --> 17:24.434
I need to fortify the unit, but
I'll need a second Luthor
electro...

17:24.478 --> 17:26.393
Her temperature is dropping
faster than Silas's.

17:26.436 --> 17:28.830
The Zulians overwhelmed the
planets they invaded so easily

17:28.873 --> 17:31.963
because the stronger
the Zulians got, the quicker
the victims turned.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.574
Alex, get Martian plasma.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.445
A transfusion might slow
M'gann's turn.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.359
On it.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.669
Hey.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.540
I'm sorry I went against your
orders.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.542
No, this is my fault.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.937
I had a hunch Martians might be
more susceptible to their
attacks.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.808
Let's just say we both screwed
up.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.598
When you go just beyond this
ridge,

17:57.641 --> 17:59.948
you'll see Shadow Lake.

17:59.991 --> 18:02.690
They'll be keeping your father
in a cave.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.518
Right at the top.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.259
Sure you don't want me to go
with you?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.349
I get it.

18:09.392 --> 18:10.872
Meet a girl in the Phantom Zone

18:10.915 --> 18:12.961
and you're not quite sure
you can trust her.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.487
Why were you sent here?

18:20.186 --> 18:24.712
For the high crime of being
the Mad King Brpxz's heir.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.108
My full name is

18:30.979 --> 18:33.547
Princess Nyxlygsptlnz.

18:33.590 --> 18:37.159
-Wait, you're actually a
princess?

18:37.203 --> 18:40.293
I guess we both told the truth.

18:40.336 --> 18:45.298
Not all fathers send you away
to save your life.

18:45.341 --> 18:50.781
Some do it because they're...
paranoid narcissists,

18:50.825 --> 18:54.002
threatened by anyone
who might take their power.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.960
Your father sent you here?

18:57.266 --> 19:00.182
But first, he killed my older
brother.

19:02.445 --> 19:05.666
My older brother was kind,

19:05.709 --> 19:07.711
and the people loved him.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.106
So he had to die.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.108
I'm so sorry. That's awful.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.807
I was next.

19:16.851 --> 19:20.115
Not that I was worth killing.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.291
He never really thought that
much of me.

19:23.945 --> 19:28.167
He used to call me a silly girl
imp.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.868
Useless and not fit to sit on a
throne.

19:36.262 --> 19:41.223
So he had me banished here
instead.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.270
Where I would live
with this...

19:45.662 --> 19:49.013
eternal souvenir
of my inadequacies.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.713
He put it on with magic

19:52.756 --> 19:56.804
and well, I don't exactly have
much of that left, do I?

20:00.503 --> 20:01.548
You're not useless.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.685
You're resourceful.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.079
Look how much you've
helped me already.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.907
And look at you moving
with that crutch.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.562
You're a natural.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.781
Just because neither have us
have our powers here

20:17.825 --> 20:20.262
doesn't mean we can't believe
in ourselves.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.263
And each other.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.093
You don't belong here just
as much as I don't.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.663
So we should get some sleep.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.231
As we're both going to save my
father in the morning.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.413
I'm wiring the funds as we
speak, Boris. <i>Pokka.</i>

20:44.417 --> 20:46.854
How can the Lex Foundation be
dry?

20:46.897 --> 20:50.118
Sir, I have the <i>Galaxy Gazette
on the phone.</i>

20:50.161 --> 20:53.556
They're hoping for a statement
on the donation you made today

20:53.600 --> 20:56.951
to the Luthor Wing
of the Children's Hospital.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.257
Dona...

20:59.083 --> 21:00.476
Lena...

21:01.434 --> 21:04.306
She drained the accounts.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.830
Gave it all to a bunch
of sick kids.

21:08.179 --> 21:10.791
She's good,
that sister of mine.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.881
Taking something perfectly
illegal and making it legal.

21:13.924 --> 21:16.840
-Sir? The press?
-I'll call them back.

21:16.884 --> 21:19.452
We have to do some damage
control. Boris is not going to
be happy

21:19.495 --> 21:22.977
that his money
went <i>dasvidaniya.</i>

21:23.020 --> 21:26.807
Then I will have Otis pay
a little visit to the hospital,

21:26.850 --> 21:29.070
on behalf of my darling...

21:30.027 --> 21:33.466
generous sister.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.729
Thank you for bringing
the new electro-core.

21:35.772 --> 21:38.253
By my calculations, at this
capacity, our containment unit

21:38.297 --> 21:39.776
would be breached in under an
hour.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.343
Well, I'm happy to help.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.650
The upgrade should fortify it.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.352
Lex.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.528
I hear your Foundation
had a very charitable day.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.400
Turn on Channel Five.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.147
Oh, my God.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.628
<i>Preliminary reports indicate
that the cause of
the fire was faulty wiring.</i>

22:05.672 --> 22:09.937
<i>When asked for comment, Lex
Luthor noted that his
sister, Lena Luthor,</i>

22:09.980 --> 22:12.461
<i>was in charge of all
recent upgrades to the wing.</i>

22:12.505 --> 22:14.594
He set fire to the
children's wing of the hospital

22:14.637 --> 22:16.073
just to get revenge on me.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.988
No! No! No!

23:08.474 --> 23:10.780
<i>Nyxlygsptlnz.</i>

23:16.046 --> 23:19.441
Nyxly? What's going on?

23:19.485 --> 23:20.877
My magic is back.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.057
Your magic's really back?

23:46.337 --> 23:48.296
-How did you do it?
-I don't know!

23:48.339 --> 23:50.820
I wasn't even trying!
That's the crazy part.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.301
All I could think about was
your encouragement.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.956
And I felt like...

23:55.999 --> 23:58.175
I had to rid myself
of my father's shackles.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.047
Both metaphorical and physical.

24:00.090 --> 24:03.137
And I knew it was right,
because every time

24:03.180 --> 24:04.704
I looked at that thing,

24:07.184 --> 24:10.144
all I could hear was my father
telling me I'm useless.

24:12.842 --> 24:15.584
I finally believed in myself
enough to figure it out.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.630
You had the power all along.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.067
I'm finally starting to feel
like my old self again.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.723
At least, who I think I was.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.856
Who I was before...

24:26.900 --> 24:28.597
I got here.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.643
What do you mean?

24:30.686 --> 24:34.298
Ever since the Phantom Zone
fractured, I started to get
these...

24:34.951 --> 24:36.649
flashes.

24:36.692 --> 24:39.042
Like, fake memories.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.262
I mean, they were things
that I knew didn't happen.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.135
But they feel so real.

24:45.179 --> 24:48.182
Like they were from
another life you lived.

24:48.225 --> 24:50.576
Another time? Another reality?

24:50.619 --> 24:53.274
-Exactly.
-I've been getting them too.

24:53.317 --> 24:56.669
You said they started happening
after the Phantom Zone
fractured?

24:56.712 --> 25:00.673
Is it kind of crazy that I'm so
glad that you get them too?

25:00.716 --> 25:03.937
This place. It can be very...

25:04.590 --> 25:06.069
lonely.

25:06.113 --> 25:08.550
That's why I rescued you.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.857
I've got a good feeling about
you.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.906
Let's go save your father.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.084
He's a maniac.

25:21.128 --> 25:24.871
This is just sport to him. It's
just another way to beat me.

25:24.914 --> 25:28.788
I hate him. So much.
I hate his face.
I hate his voice.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.704
I hate his suits, I hate his
never-ending games
of depravity.

25:31.747 --> 25:35.055
I wish he would just die.
I wish we could kill him.

25:35.098 --> 25:37.144
We should kill him.

25:37.187 --> 25:40.277
We can craft the perfect
murder. First, with just
the tiniest re-wiring

25:40.321 --> 25:43.150
of his home, we can deliver
a near-fatal electric blow.

25:43.193 --> 25:47.241
He'll be paralyzed but he'll
still be aware of what's
happening to him.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.938
From there, we'll finish him.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.027
You choose the method,
he's your brother.

25:51.071 --> 25:53.247
But just make it slow, okay?

25:53.290 --> 25:55.249
After that we'll dismember the
body

25:55.292 --> 25:57.730
and scatter the pieces
across the universe.

25:57.773 --> 26:00.471
I know exactly which planets
have atmospheres with pressures

26:00.515 --> 26:03.039
high enough to decompose
carbon in an instant.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.476
This time there will be
no Lex resurrection.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.913
Brainy, stop.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.001
Okay?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.918
-We can't kill Lex.
-Why not?

26:13.006 --> 26:15.617
You just suggested it.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.837
Lena, you've already done it.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.754
Brainy, it turned me into
the darkest version of myself.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.931
I know it's hard, but you can't
go down this dark path, okay?

26:24.974 --> 26:26.759
You're a good person.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.717
Then what do we do?

26:28.761 --> 26:31.590
What do we do? What am I
supposed to do?

26:31.633 --> 26:35.245
Ever since I removed
my personality inhibitors, I...

26:35.289 --> 26:39.641
I have been overwhelmed
by the depth of my emotions.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.469
The rage?

26:41.512 --> 26:43.471
It's always there.

26:43.514 --> 26:47.954
Seeping out, burning me like
acid and...

26:47.997 --> 26:50.173
All I want to do is help you
destroy him, Lena.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.874
I need to destroy him.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.140
And if I can't do that, then...

27:02.142 --> 27:04.840
how do I make these feelings
go away?

27:06.363 --> 27:08.583
Brainy, we were wrong.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.805
You can't put your emotions
into little boxes,
they'll eat away

27:12.848 --> 27:15.938
at you until there's nothing
left.

27:15.982 --> 27:19.289
And I know it's hard,
but you have to embrace that.

27:19.333 --> 27:22.989
It's okay to feel rage.
You just gotta let it out
and then let it go.

27:31.867 --> 27:35.697
I hate him!
I hate him!

27:46.577 --> 27:48.057
And I'm...

27:49.319 --> 27:50.756
I miss her.

27:53.889 --> 27:54.716
Hey.

27:57.632 --> 27:58.589
Me too.

28:15.650 --> 28:18.218
The Martian plasma infusion
is complete.

28:18.261 --> 28:21.874
It seems to have slowed down
M'gann's transformation
for now.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.310
But it won't stop it.

28:25.312 --> 28:28.271
I've been going through
Brainy's Intel on Phantoms.

28:32.232 --> 28:33.494
It's inevitable.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.453
M'gann's life-force, her...

28:37.541 --> 28:38.412
soul.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.372
Will be lost.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.159
You were so right.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.250
I was so afraid to feel, to...

28:51.686 --> 28:53.601
grieve, that I...

28:53.644 --> 28:56.038
just put my head down,
and I marched.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.913
But I still made mistakes.

29:00.956 --> 29:05.134
I shielded my emotions
and I put M'gann...

29:05.178 --> 29:06.483
in danger.

29:17.843 --> 29:21.020
I've already lost so many
people that I love.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.075
This morning,

29:35.599 --> 29:37.645
I couldn't get out of bed.

29:37.688 --> 29:40.822
because I did not want to live
in a world without Kara.

29:42.650 --> 29:47.829
So, I know how much you wanna
give up.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.179
But you have to fight.

29:50.223 --> 29:54.140
-M'gann? She's still in there.

29:54.183 --> 29:58.797
And even if there's the
smallest chance that we can
save her, you have to try.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.017
For her. For her soul.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.412
You're right.

30:05.455 --> 30:08.589
Wait, you bonded with her soul
to stop Myriad.

30:08.632 --> 30:13.376
I'm not an expert, okay? But
what if there is a way that we
can harness

30:13.420 --> 30:17.293
your piece of M'gann's soul
to stop her from turning?

30:18.381 --> 30:19.992
But--

30:20.035 --> 30:22.559
If we try and it doesn't work

30:22.603 --> 30:24.910
I'll lose what little I have
left of her.

30:24.953 --> 30:28.652
Living with fragments of the
people we love, pales in
comparison

30:28.696 --> 30:31.394
to the real thing. Trust me.

30:33.309 --> 30:35.007
All right.

30:36.269 --> 30:37.836
All right.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.621
I'm willing to give it a try.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.537
And I think--

30:43.580 --> 30:45.887
I think I might know
just the thing we need.

30:51.588 --> 30:54.548
Hey, thanks for coming. We need
all hands on deck for this.

30:54.591 --> 30:57.203
Of course. I brought the
Obsidian Neuro-Imager you asked
for.

30:57.246 --> 30:58.944
Thank you, Kelly.

30:58.987 --> 31:01.294
Think of what we're about to do
as a soul transfusion.

31:01.337 --> 31:04.253
First, we'll need a Sacred
U'ra'er'run.

31:05.646 --> 31:08.040
It's used for spiritual rituals
in Mars.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.042
This one's been
in my family for centuries.

31:10.085 --> 31:11.652
How does it work?

31:11.695 --> 31:14.220
In theory, the U'ra'er'run
will act as a conductor.

31:14.263 --> 31:17.440
A modified Fal-Tor-Pan as it
were.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.619
<i>The Search for Spock?</i>

31:25.100 --> 31:28.234
It'll allow us to re-fuse
J'onn's piece of M'gann's soul
to her body.

31:28.277 --> 31:31.890
And, Kelly, you'll neuro-image
M'gann, make sure she's safe
during the transfer.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.936
-Okay.
-Brainy will man
the U'ra'er'run,

31:34.980 --> 31:36.938
while I cleave M'gann's soul
from mine.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.592
I'll then transfer it

31:38.635 --> 31:40.376
into here to complete the
process.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.422
The transfusion has to happen
at the exact moment

31:42.465 --> 31:44.250
M'gann's soul leaves her body,

31:44.293 --> 31:45.860
but before she starts to turn.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.862
If we miss this window,

31:47.906 --> 31:49.429
she will be lost.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.173
The temperature inside
the tower just plummeted.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.088
It's the Phantoms. They must
have followed the others here.

31:56.131 --> 31:58.699
I've got M'gann.
You take care of
those Phantoms.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.135
Brainy. Lena.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.277
Okay, we need to contain them
before they get to J'onn and
M'gann.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.974
The Kinetic Inhibitor
isn't ready.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.280
We can't get close enough
to restrain them.

32:14.323 --> 32:16.195
-It's too risky.
-My portal watch...

32:16.238 --> 32:19.285
I can reroute the exit
coordinates to transport the
Phantoms

32:19.328 --> 32:21.417
to a sub containment unit
from a safe distance.

32:21.461 --> 32:24.855
I just need something to draw
them all to the same point.

32:24.899 --> 32:26.640
Or someone.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.077
Brainy, will you be my wingman?

32:29.121 --> 32:31.123
It would be my utmost pleasure.

32:31.166 --> 32:34.822
Lena, you get to rerouting the
watch. We'll draw them in.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.955
They're coming through the
elevator. Let's gear up.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.228
Nice choice.

32:59.194 --> 33:01.153
Hey, I don't remember sending
you an invitation.

33:09.204 --> 33:10.901
Extraction complete.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.427
Ready for the next phase.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.089
Temperature dropping.

33:34.447 --> 33:35.796
Lena, how we looking?

33:35.839 --> 33:37.058
I've almost set the new
coordinates.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.174
Stay away from her.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.537
-My blaster is over-heating.
-Brainy, I'm coming for you.

34:21.581 --> 34:22.886
Lena, the portal?

34:22.930 --> 34:23.974
There! Now!

34:39.251 --> 34:42.167
We got his progeny, but the
Prime Phantom seems to have
portaled away.

34:43.516 --> 34:44.343
M'gann.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.308
M'gann!

34:54.527 --> 34:55.354
J'onn.

35:07.844 --> 35:10.978
You put children in danger
just to get back at me.

35:13.981 --> 35:17.898
Lena. Are you gonna shoot me?
Again?

35:20.988 --> 35:22.729
You know, I've thought about it

35:22.772 --> 35:25.645
very seriously,

35:25.688 --> 35:28.691
but the last time I did that,
it didn't change anything.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.867
'Cause look at us. Here we are,
back in our same pattern,

35:30.911 --> 35:33.914
locked in this endless game of
cat and mouse that you love so
much.

35:33.957 --> 35:35.176
You love it, too.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.612
You just hate losing.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.181
Well, you can't lose if you
don't play.

35:41.617 --> 35:42.923
I'm leaving Luthor Corp.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.186
For good.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.709
You can't leave.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.537
Who'll "protect" this place

35:48.581 --> 35:50.148
-from the "monster"
that is Lex Luthor?
-Honestly?

35:51.323 --> 35:53.281
Your own hubris.

35:53.325 --> 35:57.981
Left to your own devices,
you'll self-destruct.
You always do.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.288
You're just upset
about the kids.
You're not thinking straight.

36:00.332 --> 36:02.116
I've never been more clear.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.814
Fighting with you
has brought me
nothing but misery.

36:04.858 --> 36:08.078
And washing your toxic behavior
out of my life, I'll be free.

36:09.558 --> 36:10.864
I can finally be happy.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.606
I don't believe you.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.523
This is just another move.

36:17.566 --> 36:18.828
I promise you, it's not.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.091
I'm done playing games.

36:23.224 --> 36:26.009
I called the DA
and made a deal.

36:26.053 --> 36:29.056
I leave Luthor Corp and he'll
drop the investigation.

36:29.099 --> 36:32.842
You do realize you won't get a
penny from the company
after you leave.

36:32.886 --> 36:34.670
Everything you've worked for
will be gone.

36:36.585 --> 36:37.760
Goodbye, Lex.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.764
You can't just walk away.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.637
You hate me too much.

36:46.465 --> 36:47.683
I do hate you.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.817
I just love me more.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.873
Hey.

37:03.917 --> 37:05.919
So, I almost lost you today,

37:05.962 --> 37:08.661
because I was too busy
soldiering on to open up

37:08.704 --> 37:11.272
and share my fears with you.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.056
I won't ever do that again.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.059
From now on...

37:17.496 --> 37:18.671
we're a team.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.109
We already were.

37:22.152 --> 37:27.680
I'm only here because a copy of
my soul resided within you.

37:27.723 --> 37:32.424
I had a hunch that you'd be a
good one to bind to, J'onn
J'onzz.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.513
-I'm not bad.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.357
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:58.972 --> 38:00.147
What are those for?

38:01.017 --> 38:04.064
For being my rock today.

38:04.107 --> 38:05.979
I don't know. I'll just...

38:07.850 --> 38:08.938
I was your rock?

38:11.941 --> 38:14.596
I couldn't save anyone today.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.945
That's not true.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.297
You saved me.

38:19.340 --> 38:24.345
You reminded me that
when I want
to disappear from the world,

38:24.389 --> 38:27.000
I need to just... get up

38:27.043 --> 38:29.742
and shake myself off

38:29.785 --> 38:31.700
and face the hard things.

38:32.701 --> 38:35.356
Because people that we love

38:35.400 --> 38:37.184
are worth it.

38:37.227 --> 38:40.143
Life is worth it.

38:40.187 --> 38:43.016
When I saw J'onn start to lose
hope today,

38:43.059 --> 38:46.672
it was like looking in a
mirror...

38:48.891 --> 38:51.372
And then I heard your voice.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.418
You were telling me that
even in

38:53.461 --> 38:55.376
the darkest times

38:55.420 --> 38:57.596
we can always find a glimmer of
hope.

38:59.424 --> 39:02.209
J'onn wanted to give up today,

39:02.252 --> 39:05.343
but he didn't. None of us did.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.520
And we did the impossible.

39:11.523 --> 39:14.395
Move in with me.

39:14.439 --> 39:18.356
I wanna wake up every morning
and tell you how much I love
you.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.620
Because life is crazy
and it's unpredictable

39:21.663 --> 39:23.796
and all the really matters is
that we share the little things

39:23.839 --> 39:26.581
with the people that we love,
so...

39:29.062 --> 39:29.889
what do you say?

39:31.586 --> 39:33.719
Yes.

39:33.762 --> 39:37.549
-Alex Danvers, yes.
-Okay.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.044
I see you won your war
with Ms. Luthor.

40:00.702 --> 40:03.749
So, what's next for
the Man Who Has Everything?

40:05.620 --> 40:07.230
I go get more.

40:23.029 --> 40:25.161
Hi, boys.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.120
You know, you really shouldn't
sharpen your knives quite so
loudly.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.252
It makes it super easy to find
you.

40:32.691 --> 40:35.128
-Kara!
-I'm getting you out.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.352
Kara. Thank you.

40:43.179 --> 40:45.225
How did you do that?

40:45.268 --> 40:47.488
-Who are you?
-Zor-El, this is Nyxly.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.664
She's who helped me rescue you.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.059
Thank you for your help.

40:54.016 --> 40:56.236
Oh, don't sweat it.

40:56.279 --> 40:59.979
Right, I guess you'll be
getting back to where you came
from now.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.981
Yes, you'll be safer there.

41:02.024 --> 41:05.245
Actually, um, I don't think we
should retreat.

41:05.288 --> 41:06.638
I think we should keep looking

41:06.681 --> 41:08.988
-for a way out.
-Of the Phantom Zone?

41:09.031 --> 41:11.730
There isn't one. Believe me,
I've looked.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.645
You didn't know where to look.

41:13.688 --> 41:17.431
My mother built this place.
There is a way out.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.998
It's tied to an anchor
that tethers this place

41:19.041 --> 41:20.608
to the rest of the universe.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.349
But it's in a different part
of the Phantom Zone.

41:22.392 --> 41:25.526
Maybe there's a safer way
to travel through portals

41:25.570 --> 41:28.616
