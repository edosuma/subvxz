WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.176
DYLAN AND KATHERINE RAISED
THEIR PROFILE

00:05.176 --> 00:09.110
AND ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION
OF AN UNWANTED ADMIRER.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.482
MIKE MADE
A SURPRISING REQUEST...

00:11.482 --> 00:13.114
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN FORGIVE ME?

00:13.114 --> 00:16.317
WHICH BROUGHT ORSON'S GUILT
TO THE SURFACE.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.190
I'M SORRY, MIKE.
 OH, YOU'RE SLEEPWALKING.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.452
I'M SORRY I RAN YOU OVER,
MIKE.

00:21.452 --> 00:24.125
GABY WAS LEARNING TO DEAL
WITH CARLOS BEING BLIND...

00:24.125 --> 00:26.757
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT
I'M PUTTING YOU THROUGH.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.762
IF IT FOR ANYONE BUT YOU,
IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT.

00:31.762 --> 00:35.266
AND LYNETTE WORRIED...
 IT'S RICK'S PLACE--
TOTALLY WENT UP IN FLAMES.

00:35.266 --> 00:39.570
THAT JEALOUSY COULD DRIVE TOM
TO AN ACT OF VIOLENCE.

00:44.745 --> 00:48.179
(Mary Alice) THE THING YOU HAVE
TO KNOW ABOUT LYNETTE SCAVO

00:48.179 --> 00:51.722
IS THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS TRUSTED
HER HUSBAND TOM,

00:51.722 --> 00:56.487
MOSTLY BECAUSE SHE COULD
ALWAYS TELL WHEN HE WAS LYING.

00:56.487 --> 01:00.491
SOMETIMES HE WOULD ASK HER
TO REPEAT THE QUESTION...

01:00.491 --> 01:03.564
DID I EAT... YOUR ICE CREAM?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING?

01:03.564 --> 01:07.268
OR HE WOULD USE ODD WORDS
HE HAD NEVER USED BEFORE...

01:07.268 --> 01:09.600
OH, I THINK IT LOOKS...

01:09.600 --> 01:11.342
SPIFFY.

01:11.342 --> 01:13.674
OR HIS VOICE
WOULD GET HIGHER...

01:13.674 --> 01:15.346
I GUESS SHE'S PRETTY.

01:15.346 --> 01:17.848
I MEAN... (squeaky voice)
I DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE.

01:17.848 --> 01:19.180
(gas hisses)

01:19.180 --> 01:22.183
CLEARLY, TOM SCAVO WAS
AT A DISTINCT DISADVANTAGE

01:22.183 --> 01:24.255
WHEN LYING TO HIS WIFE.

01:24.255 --> 01:26.757
AND ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING,

01:26.757 --> 01:30.121
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT LYNETTE...

01:30.121 --> 01:32.263
WAS COUNTING ON.

01:32.263 --> 01:35.466
(knob clicks, gas hisses)

01:35.466 --> 01:37.798
WHATCHA DOING?

01:37.798 --> 01:39.800
I AM JONESING
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE,

01:39.800 --> 01:42.203
BUT THE STUPID BURNER
IS ACTING UP AGAIN.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.674
NEED A LITTLE CAFFEINE FIX?

01:43.674 --> 01:45.676
BIG-TIME.

01:45.676 --> 01:48.539
TOO MUCH BOOZE LAST NIGHT.
I'M REALLY DRAGGIN'. (chuckles)

01:48.539 --> 01:51.182
THE OPEN BAR IS
NO LONGER YOUR FRIEND, HUH?

01:51.182 --> 01:52.513
GUESS NOT.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.515
BUTTHEY WERE POURING
TOP-SHELF STUFF,

01:54.515 --> 01:56.787
AND I COULDN'T RESIST.

01:56.787 --> 01:59.290
IS THAT WHERE YOU WERE DURING
BREE'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH--

01:59.290 --> 02:01.692
DOING FREE SHOTS AT THE BAR?

02:01.692 --> 02:03.694
NO.
UH, I THINK THAT'S WHEN

02:03.694 --> 02:06.227
I SNUCK OUT TO THE CAR
TO LISTEN TO THE GAME.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.758
YOU GO ALONE?

02:07.758 --> 02:11.202
WELL, I WOULD'VE
INVITED CARLOS, EXCEPT...

02:11.202 --> 02:13.864
OBVIOUSLY, HE CAN'T REALLY
SNEAK AROUND ANYMORE, SO...

02:13.864 --> 02:16.237
(chuckles) YEAH.

02:19.170 --> 02:20.671
I WAS THINKIN',

02:20.671 --> 02:23.574
IF ANYONE ASKS
ABOUT THAT FIRE AT RICK'S,

02:23.574 --> 02:25.576
IT'D BE GOOD
IF YOU HAD SOMEONE

02:25.576 --> 02:27.578
TO ACCOUNT
FOR WHERE YOU WERE.

02:27.578 --> 02:31.182
WHY WOULD IT MATTER? (chuckles)
I DIDN'T START THE FIRE.

02:31.182 --> 02:33.354
RIGHT, RIGHT.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.557
IT'S JUST...
IF ANYONETHINKSYOU DID,

02:36.557 --> 02:39.560
IT'D BE HANDY IF YOU COULD
PROVE THEM WRONG, WOULDN'T IT?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.392
(shuts drawer)

02:41.392 --> 02:43.264
YOU THINK I DID IT.

02:43.264 --> 02:46.567
NO.
 ONE STUPID BRICK,
AND NOW I'M AN ARSONIST?

02:46.567 --> 02:48.599
NO, NO. OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S JUST,

02:48.599 --> 02:51.602
IF THE POLICE CAME HERE
TO ASK US ABOUT THE BRICK,

02:51.602 --> 02:53.604
THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA
ASKUSABOUT THE FIRE,

02:53.604 --> 02:55.606
SO YOU MIGHT
WANNA BE READY.

02:58.249 --> 02:59.750
LISTEN TO ME, LYNETTE.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.253
AS MAD AS I HAVE BEEN
AT RICK,

03:02.253 --> 03:06.186
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS FIRE.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.658
WE'RE FINE.

03:07.658 --> 03:08.819
OKAY.

03:08.819 --> 03:10.821
GOOD. (chuckles)
 UH-HUH.

03:10.821 --> 03:14.495
LYNETTE SCAVO
HAD ALWAYS TRUSTED HER HUSBAND.

03:14.495 --> 03:19.370
SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT TRUST...

03:19.370 --> 03:35.215
WAS ABOUT TO GO UP IN FLAMES.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.289
EVERYONE BREAKS THE RULES
NOW AND AGAIN,

03:38.289 --> 03:42.853
AND WHEN THEY DO,
THEY ALWAYS HAVE AN EXCUSE...

03:42.853 --> 03:48.299
LIKE THE NEIGHBOR WHOSE
OWN TRASH WAS ALREADY FULL...

03:48.299 --> 03:53.233
OR THE BLONDE WHO FORGOT
TO EAT HER BREAKFAST...

03:53.233 --> 03:57.768
OR THE EMPLOYEE WHO NEEDED
AN ADVANCE ON HIS SALARY...

03:57.768 --> 03:59.270
(shuts register drawer)

03:59.270 --> 04:00.771
IT'S TRUE--

04:00.771 --> 04:04.244
EVERYONE HAS A REASON
FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES...

04:04.244 --> 04:07.818
(siren wails)

04:07.818 --> 04:13.023
EVEN THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE MEANT TO ENFORCE THEM.

04:13.023 --> 04:16.255
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION,
PLEASE.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.329
WELL, WHAT DID I DO?
I WASN'T SPEEDING.

04:18.329 --> 04:21.261
THERE'S A CONSTRUCTION ZONE BACK
THERE. YOU FAILED TO SLOW DOWN.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.494
ARE YOU SURE? I DIDN'T
SEE A SIGN OR ANYTHING.

04:23.494 --> 04:25.836
YOU WANNA STEP OUT
OF THE CAR, PLEASE?

04:25.836 --> 04:28.439
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE ME
A TICKET, ARE YOU?

04:28.439 --> 04:32.373
MY MOM WILL KILL ME.
 WHERE DO YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

04:32.373 --> 04:33.504
FAIRVIEW HIGH.

04:33.504 --> 04:36.377
PRETTY NECKLACE.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.349
OH, THANKS.

04:41.051 --> 04:44.355
LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION ZONE.

04:44.355 --> 04:47.658
I WOULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN
IF I HAD SEEN THE SIGN, I SWEAR.

04:49.420 --> 04:50.921
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

04:50.921 --> 04:52.923
I'LL LET YOU GO
WITH A WARNING.

04:52.923 --> 04:55.295
JUST PAY MORE ATTENTION
NEXT TIME, OKAY?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.598
THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU. THANK YOU.

05:03.574 --> 05:05.576
(engine starts)

05:18.889 --> 05:20.020
(sighs)

05:20.020 --> 05:22.553
THAT'S EVERYTHING,
I GUESS.

05:22.553 --> 05:25.696
WELL, IF YOU FORGOT SOMETHING,
YOU CAN JUST COME BACK FOR IT,

05:25.696 --> 05:28.699
OR... YOU COULD JUST
NOT LEAVE.

05:28.699 --> 05:31.001
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET,
BUT...

05:31.001 --> 05:33.604
(grunts) OUR HOUSE
IS LIVABLE AGAIN--

05:33.604 --> 05:35.105
THE DOWNSTAIRS ANYWAY--

05:35.105 --> 05:37.408
AND WE HAVE IMPOSED
LONG ENOUGH.

05:37.408 --> 05:39.410
BESIDES, MIKE IS
COMING HOME TONIGHT,

05:39.410 --> 05:41.712
AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED
THE HOUSE TO YOURSELVES.

05:41.712 --> 05:44.575
WELL, BEFORE YOU GO,

05:44.575 --> 05:47.648
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT,
UM...

05:47.648 --> 05:50.350
(voice breaks) HAVING YOU HERE
THESE LAST FEW WEEKS--

05:50.350 --> 05:52.352
SUSAN, I'M JUST GOING
ACROSS THE STREET.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.386
THERE'S NO NEED TO ACT
LIKE A SILENT MOVIE HEROINE.

05:55.386 --> 05:57.958
(crying) I KNOW.
I JUST... I CAN'T STOP NOW.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.790
I BROKE THE SEAL.

05:59.790 --> 06:02.393
WELL, UM,
AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE

06:02.393 --> 06:04.395
THIS NAKED DISPLAY
OF EMOTION,

06:04.395 --> 06:07.498
YOU KNOW HOW THIS SORT OF THING
MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

06:07.498 --> 06:08.799
I CAN'T HELP IT.

06:08.799 --> 06:10.801
MY HORMONES
ARE IN OVERDRIVE.

06:10.801 --> 06:14.645
DIDN'T YOU GET THAT WAY
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT?
 NO. NEVER.

06:14.645 --> 06:18.449
REALLY? NOT EVEN WHEN
YOU HEARD AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR?

06:18.449 --> 06:20.150
NO. NEVER.

06:20.150 --> 06:22.753
OH, I JUST CAN'T
CONTROL MYSELF LIKE THAT.

06:22.753 --> 06:25.516
OH, SURE, YOU CAN.

06:25.516 --> 06:28.388
WHENEVER I FEEL MY EMOTIONS
GETTING THE BEST OF ME,

06:28.388 --> 06:30.390
I SIMPLY PICTURE
AN EMPTY BOX,

06:30.390 --> 06:34.124
AND I TAKE WHATEVER I'M FEELING
AND PUT THATINTHE BOX,

06:34.124 --> 06:36.727
AND THEN I PICTURE MYSELF
PUTTING THE BOX AWAY

06:36.727 --> 06:40.671
IN A BIG, EMPTY CLOSET
AND CLOSING THE DOOR.

06:40.671 --> 06:43.133
THEN IF I HAVE TIME,

06:43.133 --> 06:45.536
I GO BACK AND OPEN THE BOX

06:45.536 --> 06:47.938
AND DEAL
WITH THE EMOTION...

06:47.938 --> 06:50.681
IN PRIVATE, LIKE A LADY.

06:52.443 --> 06:53.944
THANKS.

06:55.686 --> 06:59.049
I'M GONNA TRY THAT.

06:59.049 --> 07:01.852
(sniffles)

07:01.852 --> 07:04.495
SO YOU DON'T THINK
I ACT LIKE A LADY?

07:05.696 --> 07:06.827
(gasps)

07:06.827 --> 07:08.559
PROVE ME WRONG, SWEETIE.

07:08.559 --> 07:11.702
PROVE ME WRONG.

07:11.702 --> 07:13.804
ALL RIGHT.

07:13.804 --> 07:16.467
COME ON, GIRL.

07:16.467 --> 07:19.540
OKAY, CARLOS,
HERE'S THE HARNESS.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.842
THERE YOU ARE!

07:21.842 --> 07:24.575
OH, YOU MUST BE ROXY!

07:24.575 --> 07:27.548
AREN'T YOU THE CUTEST THING!
OH!

07:27.548 --> 07:30.921
OKAY, NOT TOO CLOSE.
IT'S SILK.
 GABY, THIS IS STEVE.

07:30.921 --> 07:35.085
HE'S THE HEAD TRAINER
AT THE DOG SCHOOL.
 AH, NICE TO MEET YOU.
CARLOS TOLD ME

07:35.085 --> 07:37.457
HOW MUCH HE ENJOYED
TAKING CLASSES WITH ROXY.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.931
WELL, THEY MAKE A GREAT TEAM.
 WELL, I HAVE GOT
A MILLION QUESTIONS

07:40.931 --> 07:43.734
ABOUT
THIS LITTLE LIFESAVER HERE.
 OKAY, SHOOT.

07:43.734 --> 07:45.496
OKAY,
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION--

07:45.496 --> 07:47.838
CARLOS AND I ARE
SITTING ON THE COUCH.

07:47.838 --> 07:50.541
I'M DOING MY NAILS.
HE'S WHINING FOR THE REMOTE.

07:50.541 --> 07:53.574
HOW DO I GET ROXY
TO FETCH IT FOR HIM?

07:53.574 --> 07:54.575
(laughs)

07:54.575 --> 07:56.507
SHE'S SERIOUS.

07:57.648 --> 08:01.512
OH. ROXY DOESN'T DO THAT.

08:01.512 --> 08:04.515
UM, HER JOB IS TO GET CARLOS
FROM POINT "A" TO POINT "B"

08:04.515 --> 08:06.186
AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE.

08:06.186 --> 08:09.590
I GET THAT, BUT SURELY
SHE'S TRAINED TO DO OTHER STUFF,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.892
YOU KNOW, LIKE FIND HIS KEYS
OR TURN OFF THE RADIO

08:11.892 --> 08:13.564
OR LICK UP HIS SPILLS.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.566
YEAH, AND AFTER THAT,

08:15.566 --> 08:18.899
SHE CAN GO SOLVE CRIMES
WITH SHAGGY AND THE GANG.
 DON'T GIVE ME
YOUR BLIND SARCASM.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.902
I SAW A COLLIE ON TV
WHO COULD PUSH A LAWN MOWER.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.235
DO YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE?
 GABY, ROXY'S FANTASTIC.

08:25.235 --> 08:27.878
REALLY? WELL, FOR A DOG
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO HELP US,

08:27.878 --> 08:29.740
SHE SOUNDS KIND OF LIMITED.

08:29.740 --> 08:32.511
(baby voice)
SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.515
SHE'S NOT HERE TO HELPUS.
 SHE'S HERE TO HELP ME,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.518
WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW
IF YOU HAD BOTHERED TO SHOW UP

08:38.518 --> 08:40.520
TO THE SPOUSES' ORIENTATION.
 WELL, I'M SORRY.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.553
I WAS ON MY HANDS AND KNEES
THAT DAY,

08:42.553 --> 08:44.054
SCOURING THE BATHROOM FLOOR

08:44.054 --> 08:46.597
BECAUSE YOU REFUSED
TO PEE LIKE A GIRL.

08:46.597 --> 08:48.098
SO...

08:48.098 --> 08:49.660
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

08:49.660 --> 08:51.602
NO, IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR.

08:51.602 --> 08:53.604
CARLOS GETS
A NEW BEST FRIEND,

08:53.604 --> 08:56.106
AND I GET TO CHECK THE SOFA
FOR TICKS.

08:56.106 --> 08:58.769
YAY FOR GABY!

08:58.769 --> 09:00.611
DID I EXAGGERATE?

09:00.611 --> 09:03.013
ACTUALLY, YOU WERE KIND.

09:04.715 --> 09:08.078
OH, IT FEELS GOOD TO TAKE
A SHOWER IN MY OWN HOUSE.

09:08.078 --> 09:09.580
WHAT YOU DOING?

09:09.580 --> 09:11.582
IN HONOR OF YOU COMING HOME,

09:11.582 --> 09:13.584
WE ARE MAKING
YOUR FAVORITE MEAL--

09:13.584 --> 09:15.085
STEAK AND MASHED POTATOES.

09:15.085 --> 09:17.087
OH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,

09:17.087 --> 09:19.930
MY FAVORITE IS
POTATOES AU GRATIN. MMM.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.762
SINCE WHEN?

09:21.762 --> 09:24.935
SINCE ALWAYS.
SINCE I WAS 3. HMM.

09:24.935 --> 09:27.137
YOU COULD SAY "AU GRATIN"
WHEN YOU WERE 3?

09:27.137 --> 09:30.741
OH, IT'S FINE.
SUSAN, MASHED IS GREAT, TOO.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.305
(voice breaks)
IT'S NOT YOUR FAVORITE?

09:35.305 --> 09:36.647
(sniffles)

09:36.647 --> 09:39.049
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 EXCUSE ME.

09:39.049 --> 09:42.152
I HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING IN A BOX
AND STICK IT IN THE CLOSET.

09:46.717 --> 09:48.058
HORMONES.

09:48.058 --> 09:50.160
OH. GOT IT.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.192
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING
SETS HER OFF THESE DAYS.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.696
UH, WHICH IS WHY

09:55.696 --> 09:58.128
I HAVEN'T TOLD HER...

09:58.128 --> 10:00.671
TOLD HER WHAT?
SOMETHING WRONG?

10:00.671 --> 10:05.335
WELL, WHEN BREE AND ORSON
WERE STAYING WITH US,

10:05.335 --> 10:07.738
THIS WEIRD THING HAPPENED.

10:07.738 --> 10:09.880
OH, YEAH. NAKED ORSON?
I HEARD.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.882
MUST HAVE BEEN
QUITE A SHOW.

10:11.882 --> 10:14.745
NO,
THIS WAS THE NEXT NIGHT.

10:15.886 --> 10:17.718
HE WAS SLEEPWALKING,

10:17.718 --> 10:20.991
AND HE SAID
SOMETHING KINDA STRANGE.

10:20.991 --> 10:23.093
BUT LIKE I SAID,
HE WAS ASLEEP,

10:23.093 --> 10:24.725
SO IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.798
JULIE, WHAT'D HE SAY?

10:29.399 --> 10:31.201
HE SAID...

10:31.201 --> 10:34.264
"I'M SORRY I RAN OVER MIKE."

10:34.264 --> 10:36.707
(chuckles) WHAT?

10:36.707 --> 10:39.209
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT? WHY WOULD
HE SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

10:39.209 --> 10:41.842
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU
WHEN THAT HAPPENED.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.714
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S CRAZY.

10:43.714 --> 10:45.876
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

10:47.417 --> 10:50.420
OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON MOM AND MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.

10:50.420 --> 10:53.423
WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE DRAMA
IN THIS HOUSE. (chuckles)

10:57.257 --> 11:00.090
YEAH, I AGREE.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.303
HOW'S THE MOVE GOING?
NEED AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS?

11:13.303 --> 11:16.046
NO, THANKS.
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

11:16.046 --> 11:19.309
OKAY, WELL,
I WON'T GET IN YOUR WAY THEN.

11:19.309 --> 11:22.682
LET ME JUST RUN SOMETHING
BY YOU.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.684
I GOT A CALL TODAY

11:24.684 --> 11:27.958
FROM A COUPLE WHO LOVED
OUR WORK ON THE FOUNDER'S BALL.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.790
OH, HOW SWEET.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.463
YES, AND THEY WANT TO HIRE US
TO DO THEIR ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

11:33.463 --> 11:35.896
HIRE US?
BUT WE'RE NOT A BUSINESS.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.168
WE COULD BE.
THINK ABOUT IT.

11:38.168 --> 11:41.171
WE DO THE EXACT SAME THING
WE DID AT THE BALL,

11:41.171 --> 11:43.734
ONLY THIS TIME, WE WALK AWAY
WITH A BIG, FAT CHECK.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.736
KATHERINE,
NEED I REMIND YOU

11:45.736 --> 11:48.238
WE NEARLY CAME TO BLOWS
OVER FLORAL CHOICES?

11:48.238 --> 11:50.240
I THINK
IT'S OURCREATIVEFRICTION

11:50.240 --> 11:52.182
THAT MAKES US A GREAT TEAM.

11:52.182 --> 11:54.344
I THINK
IT'S OUR CREATIVE FRICTION

11:54.344 --> 11:57.347
THAT NEARLY CAUSED ME
TO POISON YOU.
 ALL RIGHT, LOOK, BREE,
I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

11:57.347 --> 12:00.751
WITH ADAM OUT OF THE HOUSE,
I REALLY NEED THE MONEY.

12:00.751 --> 12:03.193
I SYMPATHIZE. I DO,
BUT I HAVE A NEW BABY,

12:03.193 --> 12:06.496
AND IT'S REALLY MORE WORK THAN
I CARE TO TAKE ON RIGHT NOW.

12:06.496 --> 12:09.760
I UNDERSTAND.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.262
GUESS I'LL
JUST DO IT MYSELF THEN.

12:12.262 --> 12:14.034
EXCUSE ME?

12:14.034 --> 12:16.036
NOW DID YOU TAKE PICTURES

12:16.036 --> 12:18.038
OF THOSE TABLE SETTINGS
YOU DESIGNED?

12:18.038 --> 12:21.041
I'D LOVE TO GET COPIES.
THE COUPLERAVEDABOUT THEM.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.844
YEAH, SURE.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.016
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
REALLY THINK IT'S FAIR

12:26.016 --> 12:28.518
THAT YOU SHOULD PROFIT
FROM SOMETHING THAT I DESIGNED.

12:28.518 --> 12:31.521
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT WOULD
ONLY BE FAIR IF I ASKED YOU

12:31.521 --> 12:34.785
TO DO THIS WITH ME,
WHICH I DID, AND YOU SAID NO.

12:34.785 --> 12:36.526
SO ON WE GO.

12:36.526 --> 12:39.129
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND IF I SERVE
YOUR CINNAMON APPLE CRUMBLE.

12:39.129 --> 12:42.262
THAT IS A CHERISHED RECIPE
FROM MY GRANDMOTHER.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.264
WELL,
NOW IT'S A CHERISHED RECIPE

12:44.264 --> 12:46.236
FROM CATERING BY KATHERINE.

12:46.236 --> 12:48.899
OH,
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

12:48.899 --> 12:51.802
THIS IS SHAMELESS
EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL.

12:51.802 --> 12:53.974
AND?

12:53.974 --> 12:55.345
AND...

12:55.345 --> 12:57.207
IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY.

12:57.207 --> 12:59.249
I'M IN.

13:07.017 --> 13:09.019
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
NO MORE DOGGY TREATS.

13:09.019 --> 13:10.560
SHE'S HAD ENOUGH.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.062
BUT SHE'S BEEN SO GOOD.

13:12.062 --> 13:15.465
YEAH? WELL, WHEN SHE LEARNS
HOW TO MAKE GRANITE SPARKLE,

13:15.465 --> 13:17.567
SHE CAN HAVE MORE.
 I'M GIVING HER A TREAT.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.500
CARLOS, I SAID NO.
 (barks)

13:20.500 --> 13:23.033
(growls)

13:23.033 --> 13:26.576
FINE.ONETREAT.

13:26.576 --> 13:28.909
THAT'S IT.
THOSE THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE,

13:28.909 --> 13:31.882
AND UNTIL YOUR DISABILITY
KICKS IN,

13:31.882 --> 13:34.885
WE HAVE TO TIGHTEN OUR BELTS.
 SO I GUESS THAT MEANS

13:34.885 --> 13:37.187
YOU WON'T BE GETTING
YOUR HAIR DONE ANYMORE.

13:37.187 --> 13:39.890
CARLOS, REMEMBER
WHAT MY FINGERS LOOK LIKE?

13:39.890 --> 13:43.153
JUST PICTURE THE MIDDLE ONE
ALL BY ITSELF.

13:43.153 --> 13:46.196
BESIDES, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MARRIED ME FOR MY LOOKS.

13:46.196 --> 13:47.898
WELL, I'M BLIND NOW,

13:47.898 --> 13:50.400
SO AS LONG AS YOU
USE DEODORANT, I'M GOOD.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.403
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW SELFISH
YOU SOUND RIGHT NOW?

13:53.403 --> 13:55.936
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BLIND,
THE WORLD SHOULD SUFFER?

13:55.936 --> 13:58.368
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW,
$300 VISITS TO MR. FRANCOIS--

13:58.368 --> 14:01.912
CARLOS, I'M GETTING
MY HAIR DONE! END OF DISCUSSION!
 (barks)

14:01.912 --> 14:05.575
WHAT ARE YOU BARKING AT?
YOU GOT YOUR DAMN TREAT.

14:05.575 --> 14:08.078
YOU KNOW, IF WE REALLY
WANT TO SAVE MONEY,

14:08.078 --> 14:10.120
YOU COULD CUT DOWN
ON THOSE CUBAN CIGARS.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.953
OR... HERE'S A THOUGHT.
YOU COULD GET A JOB.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.585
WHY DON'T YOU GET A JOB?
 DOING WHAT?

14:15.585 --> 14:18.588
PUT FLAGS ON PENCILS
AND SELL THEM AT THE AIRPORT.

14:18.588 --> 14:22.432
WHAT DO I CARE?
JUSTGETOUT OF MY KITCHEN.
 (growling)

14:22.432 --> 14:25.335
WHOA. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

14:25.335 --> 14:26.636
I DON'T KNOW.

14:26.636 --> 14:29.169
I GUESS SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU SMACK ME.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.602
OH, SO NOW I CAN'T HIT
MY OWN HUSBAND IN MY OWN HOUSE?
 LOOK, WE CAN CUT CORNERS
ALL YOU WANT,

14:32.602 --> 14:36.546
BUT I AM NOT GONNA SKIMP WHEN
IT COMES TO MY DOG. ROXY, COME.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.381
(growls)

14:47.988 --> 14:49.489
HEY, NEIGHBOR.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.621
OH, MIKE. HEY.

14:51.621 --> 14:54.124
WELCOME BACK.
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

14:54.124 --> 14:56.126
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW ME.

14:56.126 --> 14:58.268
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

14:58.268 --> 14:59.429
YEAH.

14:59.429 --> 15:00.931
WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR?

15:00.931 --> 15:04.404
A HAMMER. WE'RE PUTTING
SOME OF THE PICTURES BACK UP.

15:06.536 --> 15:07.677
THIS IT?

15:07.677 --> 15:12.242
THANKS, BUDDY.

15:12.242 --> 15:13.984
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

15:13.984 --> 15:16.947
UH, ACTUALLY,

15:16.947 --> 15:19.549
UH, BREE'S WAITING--
WAITING FOR ME.

15:19.549 --> 15:23.253
YOU SAID SOMETHING TO JULIE
WHEN YOU WERE SLEEPWALKING.

15:24.955 --> 15:26.256
I DID?

15:26.256 --> 15:29.429
YEAH, AND I NEED YOU
TO CLEAR IT UP.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.705
ARE YOU THE GUY
THAT RAN ME OVER?

15:37.607 --> 15:40.010
(scoffs) MIKE...

15:44.975 --> 15:46.616
(whispers) I'M SO SORRY.

15:49.619 --> 15:51.651
I'M SO... (mutters)

15:54.284 --> 15:57.727
(sniffling)

16:01.161 --> 16:03.333
NO WAY.

16:05.035 --> 16:07.037
THAT MUTT IS
NOT SLEEPING IN OUR BED!

16:07.037 --> 16:09.069
SHE'S CLEAN. IT'S OKAY.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.072
NO. NO, IT'S NOT.
I READ THE PAMPHLET STEVE LEFT.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.244
THESE DOGS ARE
NOT ALLOWED ON FURNITURE.

16:14.244 --> 16:15.745
I KNOW. I...

16:15.745 --> 16:18.978
I JUST THINK IT'S GOOD FOR A DOG
TO SLEEP WITH ITS MASTER.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.280
IT HELPS US BOND.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.084
WELL, IF YOU EVER WANT
TO BOND WITH MY BOOBS AGAIN,

16:24.084 --> 16:25.715
YOU'LL GET HER OFF!
 (growls)

16:25.715 --> 16:29.719
YOU'RE BEING SELFISH. WE CAN
PUT HER AT THE FOOT OF THE BED.
 CARLOS, NO!

16:29.719 --> 16:32.222
(barks and growls)

16:32.222 --> 16:35.395
SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU YELL AT ME, REMEMBER?

16:35.395 --> 16:39.429
(continues growling)

16:39.429 --> 16:42.702
YOU'RE RIGHT, BABY.
I'M SORRY.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.305
(lowers voice)
LET ME TRY IT THIS WAY.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.208
(calmly) YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOU BLIND SON OF A BITCH.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.711
IF YOU DON'T GET THIS MANGY,
6-NIPPLED, CUJO WANNABE

16:51.711 --> 16:53.213
OFF MY SATIN SHEETS,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.415
YOU WON'T JUST NEED A DOG
TO GET AROUND.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.417
YOU'LL NEED
A MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR

16:57.417 --> 17:00.120
THAT YOU STEER
WITH YOUR TONGUE.

17:02.052 --> 17:03.723
REALLY?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.695
CARLOS, I MEAN IT.

17:06.695 --> 17:10.300
WHO'S IT GONNA BE--
ME OR THE DOG?

17:26.316 --> 17:28.117
(sighs)

17:29.549 --> 17:32.422
MATERNITY LINGERIE--
YEAH, RIGHT.

17:32.422 --> 17:35.425
WHY DON'T THEY JUST CALL IT
WHAT IT REALLY IS?

17:35.425 --> 17:39.129
A PUP TENT TO HIDE
YOUR STRETCH MARKS.

17:39.129 --> 17:41.391
OH, ACTUALLY, IF IT'S OKAY,

17:41.391 --> 17:45.195
I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD
RIGHT NOW. I'M SORRY.

17:45.195 --> 17:47.237
I UNDERSTAND.

17:47.237 --> 17:48.738
THANKS.

17:48.738 --> 17:50.740
YOU JUST DON'T WANT
TO BE CRUSHED

17:50.740 --> 17:53.243
UNDER THE WEIGHT
OF A REPULSIVE COW.

17:53.243 --> 17:54.804
THAT IS NOT IT.

17:54.804 --> 17:56.306
NO, I GET IT. (sighs)

17:56.306 --> 17:58.478
REALLY,
I KNEW THIS DAY WAS COMING.

17:58.478 --> 18:02.582
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE
A DAY WHEN I WAS SO HORNY.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.083
(shoes hit floor)

18:04.083 --> 18:07.117
HONEY, I STILL FIND YOU
INCREDIBLY SEXY.

18:07.117 --> 18:09.689
IT'S ME. I...

18:09.689 --> 18:12.622
I JUST GOT A LOT
ON MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

18:12.622 --> 18:15.195
OH. WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:15.195 --> 18:18.168
(sighs)

18:18.168 --> 18:21.171
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING
TODAY.

18:21.171 --> 18:23.373
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU,
BUT...

18:23.373 --> 18:25.375
WELL,
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.377
THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT

18:27.377 --> 18:30.280
IN ALL THOSE SESSIONS
WITH THE DOCTOR.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.442
(sighs)

18:35.345 --> 18:36.846
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:36.846 --> 18:38.848
BUT IF I TELL YOU,

18:38.848 --> 18:42.492
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO LET ME
HANDLE THIS MY OWN WAY.

18:44.194 --> 18:46.156
(rapping at door)

18:46.156 --> 18:48.158
WHO COULD THAT BE
AT THIS HOUR?

18:48.158 --> 18:49.899
(pounding on door)

18:49.899 --> 18:52.232
SUSAN.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.663
(pounding continues)

18:53.663 --> 18:55.335
WHAT ON EARTH?

18:55.335 --> 18:59.469
YOUARE NEVER TO COME
NEAR MY FAMILY EVER AGAIN!

18:59.469 --> 19:01.711
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:01.711 --> 19:04.814
DO YOU HEAR ME, ORSON?!
 DAMN IT. SUSAN, I--

19:04.814 --> 19:08.448
I TOLD YOU
TO LET ME HANDLE THIS.
 WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:08.448 --> 19:13.583
SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
YOUR HUSBAND TRIED TO KILL MIKE?

19:13.583 --> 19:15.154
WHAT?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.527
LOOK, I EXPLAINED THIS
TO MIKE.

19:17.527 --> 19:19.629
I PANICKED.
I WAS TRYING--

19:19.629 --> 19:23.233
TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR MOTHER?
I KNOW. WHO CARES?

19:23.233 --> 19:26.396
YOUDROVE THE CAR,
 YOURAN HIM OVER,

19:26.396 --> 19:28.398
ANDYOULEFT HIM FOR DEAD!

19:28.398 --> 19:30.270
SUSAN, LET'S GO.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.172
AND THE WORST PART...

19:33.172 --> 19:36.206
ALL THIS TIME,
YOU PRETENDED TO BE OUR FRIEND.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.556
(front door shuts)

20:01.271 --> 20:03.273
IF THERE WAS ONE THING

20:03.273 --> 20:06.376
GABRIELLE SOLIS
WOULD NOT TOLERATE,

20:06.376 --> 20:08.278
IT WAS A RIVAL,

20:08.278 --> 20:11.881
WHETHER SHE WALKED
ON TWO LEGS...

20:11.881 --> 20:13.783
OR FOUR.

20:13.783 --> 20:17.647
SO WHEN GABRIELLE CREPT
INTO HER BEDROOM THAT MORNING,

20:17.647 --> 20:19.849
SHE'D MADE UP HER MIND...

20:19.849 --> 20:21.251
(growls)

20:21.251 --> 20:24.654
THE BITCH HAD TO GO.

20:24.654 --> 20:26.796
(whispers) ROXY...

20:26.796 --> 20:28.958
(singsong voice)
LOOK WHAT I'VE GOT.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.300
(whines)

20:30.300 --> 20:32.432
COME ON. COME ON.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.736
OH.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.967
YES.

20:37.967 --> 20:39.939
OKAY, LET'S GO.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.411
(barking)

20:41.411 --> 20:42.912
LET'S GO, ROXY.

20:42.912 --> 20:45.915
LET'S GO, ROXY. LET'S GO.
(grunts)

20:45.915 --> 20:47.817
LET'S GOINTHE CAR.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.919
(sighs)

20:52.852 --> 20:54.624
HEY THERE, DYLAN.

20:56.826 --> 20:58.388
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME?

20:58.388 --> 21:01.391
I'M THE COP WHODIDN'TGIVE YOU
A TICKET YESTERDAY.

21:01.391 --> 21:03.593
UM, YEAH, I REMEMBER.

21:03.593 --> 21:04.894
(dog barking in distance)

21:04.894 --> 21:07.537
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I SAT DOWN?

21:07.537 --> 21:09.839
I JUST WANT TO HAVE
A LITTLE CHAT WITH YOU.

21:09.839 --> 21:12.001
WHY?

21:12.001 --> 21:14.944
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

21:14.944 --> 21:16.806
ACTUALLY, I CAN'T STAY.

21:16.806 --> 21:19.409
I'M MEETING MY FRIEND JULIE
AT THE MALL, SO I--

21:19.409 --> 21:22.582
LOOK, I'M--I'M NOT TRYING
TO SCARE YOU. I JUST...

21:22.582 --> 21:24.954
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

21:24.954 --> 21:26.886
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

21:26.886 --> 21:29.919
HOW'S YOUR MOM DOING?

21:29.919 --> 21:33.062
YOU KNOW MY MOM?

21:33.062 --> 21:35.365
OH, YEAH.

21:40.430 --> 21:42.972
LOOK,
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

21:42.972 --> 21:45.975
I SAW A PICTURE OF YOU
AND KATHY IN THE PAPER,

21:45.975 --> 21:48.978
AND I DID A BACKGROUND CHECK,
AND I FOUND OUT

21:48.978 --> 21:51.310
THAT YOU'RE LIVING
BACK AT YOUR AUNT'S PLACE.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.915
WHEN YOU LEFT YESTERDAY,
I WAS PARKED DOWN THE STREET.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.518
YOU FOLLOWED ME?

21:58.518 --> 22:01.020
SO WHEN YOU PULLED ME OVER,
THAT WAS--

22:01.020 --> 22:02.892
I LIED TO YOU.

22:02.892 --> 22:04.554
YOU WEREN'T SPEEDING.

22:04.554 --> 22:06.596
I'M SORRY.

22:07.957 --> 22:10.960
(sighs)

22:10.960 --> 22:12.962
I JUST HAD TO MEET YOU.

22:15.004 --> 22:16.936
WHOAREYOU?

22:19.569 --> 22:21.110
I'M WAYNE DAVIS.

22:24.013 --> 22:25.545
I'M YOUR FATHER.

22:27.917 --> 22:31.120
OH, ROXY, THIS WAY.
 (Steve) UM, EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.584
UH, MRS. SOLIS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:34.584 --> 22:37.356
HI.
UH, I'M BRINGING ROXY BACK.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.888
UH, WHAT?

22:38.888 --> 22:40.730
SHAME, ISN'T IT?

22:40.730 --> 22:44.894
I MEAN,IPERSONALLY ADORED
THE LITTLE ANGEL,

22:44.894 --> 22:47.737
BUT SHE AND CARLOS
JUST DID NOT GET ALONG.

22:47.737 --> 22:48.998
REALLY?

22:48.998 --> 22:52.041
WELL, SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.
I GOTTA RUN.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.904
(whimpers)
 UH, TELL CARLOS I'LL CALL HIM
ABOUT ANOTHER DOG.

22:54.904 --> 22:58.007
OH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
WE FOUND ONE.

22:58.007 --> 23:01.451
FROM WHERE? WE'RE THE ONLY
GUIDE DOG SCHOOL IN THE AREA.

23:01.451 --> 23:02.952
WELL, THAT'S IT.

23:02.952 --> 23:04.654
IT'S NOT A DOG.

23:04.654 --> 23:07.987
WE GOT HIM
A SEEING... EYE... MONKEY.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.719
HE'S AMAZING.

23:09.719 --> 23:11.090
(chuckles)

23:11.090 --> 23:13.963
NOT ONLY CAN HE CALL 9-1-1,
HE CAN TOAST A BAGEL.

23:13.963 --> 23:15.094
BYE.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.968
(growls)

23:18.968 --> 23:19.969
(engine starts)

23:19.969 --> 23:23.703
ROXY, WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED
BACK THERE?

23:23.703 --> 23:25.675
(barking)

23:25.675 --> 23:27.837
UHH! ROXY!

23:27.837 --> 23:29.679
ROXY! ROXY, STOP!

23:29.679 --> 23:32.582
(continues barking)

23:32.582 --> 23:33.913
(door shuts)

23:33.913 --> 23:35.915
GABY, WHERE WERE YOU?
WHERE'S ROXY?

23:35.915 --> 23:38.888
OH, CARLOS, I'M AFRAID
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

23:38.888 --> 23:40.189
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

23:40.189 --> 23:43.422
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW YOU LIKE IT
WHEN I READ YOU THE BOX SCORES?

23:43.422 --> 23:46.095
WHEN I WENT OUT
TO GET THE PAPER--

23:46.095 --> 23:48.197
ONLY THINKING
OF MAKING YOU HAPPY--

23:48.197 --> 23:51.430
GABY, WHERE'S MY DOG?
 SHE RAN AWAY.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.033
WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR, SHE SAW
A SQUIRREL, AND SHE TOOK OFF.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.035
SHE'S GONE?
WELL, YOU GOTTA GO FIND HER.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.438
WHERE DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN?
THERE'S NO SIGN OF HER ANYWHERE.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.211
YEAH, I'M SURE YOU LOOKED
REALLY, REALLY HARD.

24:02.211 --> 24:05.214
HOW DARE YOU. I HAVE LOOKED FROM
ONE END OF TOWN TO THE OTHER,

24:05.214 --> 24:09.919
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
 (whines)

24:09.919 --> 24:13.983
BUT SINCE YOU LOVE HER SO MUCH,
I'M GONNA KEEP LOOKING.

24:13.983 --> 24:16.155
(barks)

24:16.155 --> 24:17.657
WAS THAT ROXY?

24:17.657 --> 24:20.229
I'M NOT SURE.
WHY DON'T I GO LOOK?

24:20.229 --> 24:23.863
HUH. NO. OH, WOW.
IT'S THE SCAVO DOG...

24:23.863 --> 24:26.996
WAYDOWN IN THEIR YARD.

24:26.996 --> 24:28.698
I GUESS IT'S TRUE--

24:28.698 --> 24:31.240
LOSE ONE SENSE,
ALL THE OTHERS GET HEIGHTENED.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.942
(cell phone rings)

24:32.942 --> 24:35.945
OKAY, YOU GET THAT.
I'M GONNA GO FIND YOUR DOG.

24:35.945 --> 24:37.677
(ring)

24:37.677 --> 24:40.610
COME ON, YOU STUPID MUTT.

24:40.610 --> 24:41.651
(groans)

24:41.651 --> 24:44.113
GABY, YOU STILL HERE?

24:44.113 --> 24:46.485
YEAH,
STILL NO SIGN OF ROXY.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.788
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'M ON THE CASE.

24:48.788 --> 24:49.789
HEY.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.661
THAT WAS STEVE

24:51.661 --> 24:54.794
FROM THE GUIDE DOG PLACE.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.168
YOU WANT A PIECE OF PIE
OR SOMETHIN'?

25:03.202 --> 25:06.636
YEAH, I'M NOT HUNGRY EITHER.

25:10.079 --> 25:12.612
(sighs)

25:12.612 --> 25:15.545
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

25:15.545 --> 25:19.018
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.991
(chuckles) I'M HAVING
A GOOD TIME JUST LOOKING AT YOU.

25:24.223 --> 25:27.226
YOU HAVE MY NOSE.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.998
(chuckles)

25:28.998 --> 25:31.060
BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

25:31.060 --> 25:35.765
MY MOM SAYS WE LEFT
BECAUSE YOU USED TO BEAT HER.

25:35.765 --> 25:37.306
IS THAT TRUE?

25:37.306 --> 25:40.670
YEAH,
I HIT HER A COUPLE TIMES.

25:40.670 --> 25:42.171
SO YOU ADMIT IT?

25:42.171 --> 25:45.174
WHAT, DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA LIE AND TELL YOU

25:45.174 --> 25:47.747
THAT I WAS A GREAT HUSBAND?
'CAUSE I WASN'T.

25:47.747 --> 25:51.180
BUT YOU GOTTA KNOW, THERE'S
TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY,

25:51.180 --> 25:55.224
AND I SWEAR TO GOD, YOUR MOM
GAVE AS GOOD AS SHE GOT.

25:57.086 --> 26:00.129
(scoffs) I MEAN,
YOU BELIEVE ME, RIGHT?

26:00.129 --> 26:02.862
I DON'T KNOW.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.335
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:06.335 --> 26:08.668
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.
I SHOULD GO.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.840
GO? WE JUST GOT HERE.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.843
LOOK, I DIDN'T TRACK YOU DOWN
TO CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS.

26:13.843 --> 26:16.846
I ONLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOUR MOM RAISED YOU PROPERLY,

26:16.846 --> 26:18.848
AND NOW I SEE THAT SHE DID.

26:18.848 --> 26:20.880
I MEAN, YOU'RE...

26:20.880 --> 26:22.351
YOU'RE SPECTACULAR.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.985
THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED...
(sighs)

26:25.985 --> 26:29.118
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE OKAY
AND...

26:29.118 --> 26:32.321
THAT A LITTLE PART OF YOU
LOOKS JUST LIKE ME.

26:36.025 --> 26:38.027
HOW CAN YOU JUST WALK AWAY?

26:38.027 --> 26:41.330
'CAUSE I'M NOT THE SAME JERK
I USED TO BE.

26:41.330 --> 26:44.033
SURE, I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITHYOU,

26:44.033 --> 26:46.305
BUT IF YOUR MOM
IS STILL SCARED OF ME

26:46.305 --> 26:49.608
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
UH...

26:49.608 --> 26:51.040
NO.

26:51.040 --> 26:54.243
I DON'T WANT
TO UPSET HER AGAIN.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.618
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL HER.

27:05.254 --> 27:06.395
WHAT?

27:09.058 --> 27:11.360
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW
THAT I SAW YOU.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.203
OH, THAT'S...

27:14.203 --> 27:16.966
I DON'T KNOW ABOUTTHAT.

27:16.966 --> 27:20.209
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE
SO MANY QUESTIONS, AND...

27:20.209 --> 27:22.211
I DON'T THINK
WE'D BE HURTING ANYBODY

27:22.211 --> 27:24.373
IF WE JUST SAT
AND TALKED FOR A WHILE.

27:24.373 --> 27:29.378
AND WE'D KEEP THIS
FROM YOUR MOM?

27:33.783 --> 27:35.985
SURE.

27:35.985 --> 27:39.288
WELL...

27:39.288 --> 27:40.960
OKAY. (chuckles)

27:44.864 --> 27:47.697
DARLIN', BRING ME BACK
THAT DESSERT MENU.

27:49.999 --> 27:54.203
I WANNA HAVE A SLICE OF PIE
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.855
UH, I THINK WE MIGHT
BE OUT OF CANDLES.

28:05.855 --> 28:08.387
I DON'T THINK SO.
CHECK UNDER THE BAR.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.725
RICK.

28:15.725 --> 28:17.867
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

28:17.867 --> 28:19.969
"HOW'S IT GOIN'"?

28:19.969 --> 28:21.971
IT'S GOIN' PRETTY BAD.

28:21.971 --> 28:23.973
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
I'M SORRY.

28:23.973 --> 28:26.836
I'M SORRY--
SORRY FOR YOUR TROUBLES.

28:26.836 --> 28:29.008
OH, THAT'S TOUCHING, MAN.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.840
THANKS.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.142
SO DID YOU JUST COME HERE
TO BUST MY HUMP,

28:33.142 --> 28:37.386
OR IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?
 ACTUALLY, YOUCANHELP ME.

28:37.386 --> 28:40.850
YOU CAN HELP ME FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL THESE WERE DOING

28:40.850 --> 28:44.854
BY THE BACK DOOR
OF MY TORCHED RESTAURANT.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.032
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

28:53.032 --> 28:54.904
(matchbook hits floor)

28:54.904 --> 28:56.766
(chuckles)

28:58.237 --> 29:00.940
SO THAT'S HOW
YOU'RE GONNA PLAY THIS?

29:00.940 --> 29:03.312
UH, NO CANDLES HERE.

29:03.312 --> 29:05.975
I'M--I'M GONNA GO CHECK
IN THE BACK.

29:05.975 --> 29:07.076
GREAT.

29:09.278 --> 29:12.081
LOOK, I CAN SEE YOU'RE UPSET,
PAL,

29:12.081 --> 29:14.824
BUT I'M NOT THE GUY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

29:14.824 --> 29:17.226
(Rick)
YOU KNOW I RESPECT YOU...

29:17.226 --> 29:19.328
HEY, ANDREW.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

29:19.328 --> 29:21.330
UH, I'M LOOKING FOR CANDLES,

29:21.330 --> 29:24.864
AND--AND THAT GUY RICK'S
HERE.
 (loud clatter, glass shatters)

29:24.864 --> 29:25.995
(grunting)

29:25.995 --> 29:27.536
OH, MY GOD!

29:27.536 --> 29:29.538
STOP IT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:29.538 --> 29:32.101
STOP. HEY, EASY. EASY.
JUST STOP IT!

29:32.101 --> 29:34.203
OH!
 UHH!

29:34.203 --> 29:36.045
ARE YOU OKAY?
 YEAH.

29:36.045 --> 29:37.977
(grunts)

29:37.977 --> 29:39.548
OW!

29:41.951 --> 29:44.884
ANDREW, DO SOMETHING!

29:44.884 --> 29:46.886
DO SOMETHING!

29:48.958 --> 29:50.119
(grunts)

29:50.119 --> 29:52.561
STOP IT! STOP!

29:52.561 --> 29:55.865
OH, FOR GOD SAKES,
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

29:55.865 --> 29:58.567
WHAT ARE YOU, 12 YEARS OLD?
STOP IT.

29:58.567 --> 30:00.970
JEEZ.

30:00.970 --> 30:02.131
(grunts)

30:02.131 --> 30:04.333
(gasps)
 (crash)

30:04.333 --> 30:07.006
(glass shatters)

30:07.006 --> 30:09.208
(beeps)

30:09.208 --> 30:13.082
(siren wailing in distance)

30:13.082 --> 30:16.185
(telephone ringing)

30:16.185 --> 30:18.417
(door opens and shuts)

30:18.417 --> 30:21.420
SO WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GONNA
FINISH GRILLING MY HUSBAND?

30:21.420 --> 30:24.023
IT WON'T BE MUCH LONGER,
MA'AM.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.899
(sighs)

30:34.964 --> 30:38.507
YOU KNOW, IN SPITE OF
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

30:38.507 --> 30:41.110
IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

30:43.542 --> 30:47.977
IT MAKES ME REALIZE
HOW MUCH I MISS YOU.

30:52.922 --> 30:54.223
IF YOU INSIST

30:54.223 --> 30:56.555
ON QUESTIONING MY HUSBAND
ABOUT A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT,

30:56.555 --> 30:59.088
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

30:59.088 --> 31:01.090
OKAY.
YOU'VE GOT MY ATTENTION.

31:01.090 --> 31:03.432
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

31:03.432 --> 31:05.534
MR. COLETTI
OPENED HIS RESTAURANT

31:05.534 --> 31:07.196
TO GET BACK AT ME

31:07.196 --> 31:09.868
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH HIM.
 HONEY.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.141
OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOUR HUSBAND HADTWOMOTIVES

31:12.141 --> 31:13.642
FOR SETTING THE FIRE?

31:13.642 --> 31:18.447
NO. I AM SAYING THAT IF ANYONE
HAD AN AX TO GRIND, IT'S RICK.

31:18.447 --> 31:21.911
MAYBE HE SET THE FIRE HIMSELF
SO HE COULD BLAME MY HUSBAND.

31:21.911 --> 31:24.914
I WAS AT THE GYM.
YOU CAN CALL MY TRAINER.

31:24.914 --> 31:28.017
AND TOM WAS AT
THE FOUNDER'S BALL WITH ME.

31:28.017 --> 31:30.589
WE HAVE WITNESSES THAT SAY
HE DISAPPEARED FOR A WHILE.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.092
I TOLD YOU,
I WAS IN THE CAR

31:33.092 --> 31:35.024
LISTENING
TO THE BASKETBALL GAME.

31:35.024 --> 31:37.426
THAT'S TRUE. I SAW HIM.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.401
I WAS MAD THAT HE DITCHED ME,

31:42.401 --> 31:45.074
SO I WENT TO DRAG HIS ASS
BACK INSIDE.

31:45.074 --> 31:48.007
BUT WHEN I SAW HIM
SHOUTING AT THE RADIO,

31:48.007 --> 31:51.010
I DECIDED I'LL JUST WAIT
AND MAKE HIS LIFE MISERABLE

31:51.010 --> 31:53.512
WHEN WE GET HOME.
SO UNLESS THERE'S ALAW

31:53.512 --> 31:56.415
AGAINST CHOOSING LeBRON JAMES
OVER YOUR WIFE,

31:56.415 --> 31:58.147
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

31:58.147 --> 32:00.149
ALL RIGHT.

32:02.651 --> 32:06.595
SO THAT'S IT?
Y-YOU'RE JUST GONNA LET HIM GO?

32:06.595 --> 32:10.059
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
EVIDENCE TO HOLD HIM, SIR.

32:10.059 --> 32:13.062
BECAUSE HIS WIFE
PROVIDED HIM AN ALIBI?

32:13.062 --> 32:14.933
COME ON, MAN.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.505
RICK, LOOK.

32:16.505 --> 32:18.037
YOU KNOW ME.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.539
IF TOM HAD DONE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

32:20.539 --> 32:23.042
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULD PROTECT HIM?

32:32.721 --> 32:34.723
FINE.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.062
(shuts car door)

32:44.533 --> 32:47.496
TO MAKE UP THAT STORY FOR ME.
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T HAVE

32:47.496 --> 32:49.498
DIDN'T I?
'CAUSE IT KINDA SEEMED

32:49.498 --> 32:52.341
LIKE THEY HAD YOU
AGAINST THE ROPES IN THERE.

32:52.341 --> 32:55.204
WELL, THAT WOULD ONLY BE
A PROBLEM IF I WERE GUILTY,

32:55.204 --> 32:57.206
AND CLEARLY, I'M NOT, RIGHT?

32:57.206 --> 33:00.149
GOD, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
DO YOU?
 SURE, I DO.

33:00.149 --> 33:02.151
IT MUST'VE BEEN
SOME OTHER RANDOM MANIAC

33:02.151 --> 33:04.683
WITH A GRUDGE AGAINST RICK
WHO BURNED DOWN HIS RESTAURANT.
 SO YOU'RE CALLING ME A LIAR?

33:04.683 --> 33:08.257
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU'RE SAYING I LIED.
 WELL, IT WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME.

33:08.257 --> 33:10.389
YOU LIED ABOUT THE BRICK,
AND YOU WERE PRETTY SMOOTH, TOO.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.462
HELL,IBOUGHT IT.
 YEAH, JUST LIKE
I BOUGHT YOUR STORY

33:13.462 --> 33:16.195
ABOUT NEVER SLEEPING
WITH RICK.
 EXCUSE ME?

33:16.195 --> 33:19.098
"OH, LOOK AT ME, RICK.
YOU KNOW ME, RICK."
 OKAY.

33:19.098 --> 33:22.101
GOD, I FELT LIKE TELLING
YOU GUYS TO GET A ROOM.

33:22.101 --> 33:25.104
OKAY, YOU ARE ANGRY,
SO I'M GONNA LET THAT ONE PASS,

33:25.104 --> 33:27.706
AND I'M GONNA SAY THIS
FOR THEVERY LAST TIME.

33:27.706 --> 33:31.640
(emphatically) NOTHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND RICK.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.112
OKAY.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.616
(emphatically)
I DIDN'T SET THAT FIRE.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.318
YOU SEE?

33:39.318 --> 33:41.520
I CAN TALK SLOW, TOO.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.158
(sighs)

33:58.637 --> 34:02.040
CARLOS ASKED ME TO PICK UP
SOME DOGGY TREATS FOR ROXY.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.074
HE CALLEDYOU?
 WHY DIDN'T HE ASK ME?

34:05.074 --> 34:07.576
OH, I THINK YOU WERE BUSY
AT THE TIME...

34:07.576 --> 34:09.078
KIDNAPPING HIS GUIDE DOG.

34:09.078 --> 34:11.080
(chuckles)
CLASSY, BY THE WAY.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.581
DON'T JUDGE ME.

34:12.581 --> 34:14.583
YOU DON'T KNOW
THIS HOUND FROM HELL.

34:14.583 --> 34:17.085
I RAISE MY VOICE ATEENSYBIT,
AND SHE BARKS,

34:17.085 --> 34:19.128
OR I GIVE CARLOS A LITTLE SMACK,
AND SHE GROWLS.

34:19.128 --> 34:20.659
WELL, I HAVE AN IDEA.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.661
WHY DON'T YOUNOT
 DO THOSE THINGS?

34:25.164 --> 34:27.666
THANKS FOR THE BISCUITS,
EDIE.
 NO, I'M SERIOUS.

34:27.666 --> 34:31.199
THERE WAS ALWAYS
A CERTAIN... SICK CHARM

34:31.199 --> 34:33.502
TO THE WAY
YOU USED TO ABUSE CARLOS.

34:33.502 --> 34:36.205
BUT NOW THAT HE'S BLIND,
IT'S JUSTSICK.

34:36.205 --> 34:39.748
WE'RE FINE. THIS IS WHO WE ARE.
THIS IS OUR RELATIONSHIP.

34:39.748 --> 34:42.751
WELL, YOUR RELATIONSHIP
HAS TO CHANGE, GABY,

34:42.751 --> 34:45.154
BECAUSEHE'SCHANGED.

34:45.154 --> 34:47.356
NOT THAT MUCH.
JUST HIS EYES.

34:47.356 --> 34:51.089
MM, NO.
I KNOW CARLOS. HE'S PROUD.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.092
HE'S GONNA PRETEND THAT HE CAN
STILL GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH YOU

34:54.092 --> 34:57.094
AS IF HE WAS THE SAME MAN
THAT HE ALWAYS WAS.

34:57.094 --> 35:00.098
BUT HE'S NOT,
AND HE WILL NEVER ADMIT THAT.

35:02.531 --> 35:05.434
(scoffs) ARE YOU DONE
WITH YOUR ARMCHAIR ANALYSIS,

35:05.434 --> 35:07.105
3-DIVORCE ANNIE?

35:07.105 --> 35:11.180
SURE. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TREAT CARLOS RIGHT,

35:11.180 --> 35:14.183
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN
OUT THERE WHO WILL.

35:14.183 --> 35:16.185
I THINK I PROVED THAT.

35:25.524 --> 35:28.197
(door shuts)

35:28.197 --> 35:31.700
WHY DON'T
YOU COME INSIDE?

35:31.700 --> 35:35.404
I CAN'T COME OUT MY FRONT DOOR
EVERY DAY AND SEE THAT MAN.

35:35.404 --> 35:37.266
WE HAVE TO MOVE.

35:37.266 --> 35:39.338
(chuckles)

35:39.338 --> 35:41.270
OH. (grunts)

35:41.270 --> 35:44.173
SUSAN...

35:44.173 --> 35:45.644
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT,

35:45.644 --> 35:48.146
BUT BEFORE YOU START
PUTTING UP "FOR SALE" SIGNS,

35:48.146 --> 35:50.879
LET'S JUST TAKE A STEP BACK.

35:50.879 --> 35:53.882
TAKE A STEP BACK FROM WHAT?
HE TRIED TO MURDER YOU.

35:53.882 --> 35:57.155
I KNOW WHAT ORSON DID
WAS HORRIBLE, BUT...

35:57.155 --> 35:59.528
I'VE DECIDED
TO FORGIVE HIM.

35:59.528 --> 36:02.531
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?
HE PUT YOU IN A COMA.

36:02.531 --> 36:04.533
I SAT THERE DAY AFTER DAY,

36:04.533 --> 36:06.535
WONDERING IF YOU WERE
GONNA LIVE.

36:06.535 --> 36:09.538
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
ORSON CAN GO TO HELL.

36:09.538 --> 36:11.540
WELL, I'VE TALKED TO HIM.

36:11.540 --> 36:14.303
TRUST ME,
HE'S ALREADY BEEN THERE.

36:14.303 --> 36:15.804
WELL, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

36:15.804 --> 36:19.308
HE SHOULD PAY FOR WHAT HE DID.
HE SHOULD GO TO PRISON.

36:19.308 --> 36:21.610
AND WHAT,
LEAVE BREE WITHOUT A HUSBAND

36:21.610 --> 36:24.383
AND BENJAMIN WITHOUT A DAD?
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.755
LOOK...

36:26.755 --> 36:30.919
I'VE DONE SOME PRETTY HORRIBLE
THINGS IN MY LIFE,

36:30.919 --> 36:33.322
BUT YOU FORGAVE ME

36:33.322 --> 36:36.895
BECAUSE YOU KNEW HOW MUCH
I REGRETTED 'EM.

36:36.895 --> 36:40.669
I REALLY BELIEVE
HE'S SORRY FOR WHAT HE DID.

36:40.669 --> 36:43.201
SO NOWIHAVE
TO FORGIVEHIM.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.636
I'VE JUST GOT TO.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.382
BUT...

36:53.382 --> 36:56.785
I ALSO UNDERSTAND
IF YOU CAN'T.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.334
HEY,YOU GUYS KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF BED.

37:15.334 --> 37:18.767
HOW COME DADDY'S
SLEEPING ON THE COUCH AGAIN?

37:20.238 --> 37:21.610
COME HERE.

37:21.610 --> 37:23.312
COME ON.

37:23.312 --> 37:25.314
(pats mattress)

37:25.314 --> 37:27.576
OKAY.

37:27.576 --> 37:30.279
MOMMY AND DADDY
ARE SORT OF... FIGHTING,

37:30.279 --> 37:32.351
BUT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH IT.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.323
WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING ABOUT?

37:34.323 --> 37:40.359
OH, SOMETHING HE DID
THAT MADE MOMMY REALLY MAD.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.864
CAN WE TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.536
YES, OF COURSE.

37:47.536 --> 37:50.299
THE OTHER DAY
AT THE PIZZA PLACE...
 MM-HMM?

37:50.299 --> 37:54.042
WE HEARD DADDY SAY THAT MAN
WANTED TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM US.

37:54.042 --> 37:58.407
OH, SWEETIE, I AM SO SORRY.

37:58.407 --> 38:00.709
I BET THAT REALLY SCARED YOU,
DIDN'T IT?

38:00.709 --> 38:02.351
YEAH.

38:02.351 --> 38:04.653
SO WHEN YOU WENT
TO THAT PARTY,

38:04.653 --> 38:07.986
WE GOT ON OUR BIKES
AND RODE DOWN TO HIS RESTAURANT.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.960
YOU DID WHAT?

38:11.960 --> 38:14.463
WE JUST WANTED HIM
TO GO AWAY.

38:14.463 --> 38:17.596
THAT'S WHYWESET THE FIRE.

38:17.596 --> 38:22.331
SOPLEASE
 DON'T BE MAD AT DADDY.

38:22.331 --> 38:25.073
OH, MY GOD.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.818
(sighs)

38:39.818 --> 38:41.690
(sighs)

38:45.053 --> 38:47.896
MIKE SAYS
I NEED TO FORGIVE ORSON...

38:47.896 --> 38:50.529
SUSAN--
 AND HE'S RIGHT.

38:50.529 --> 38:55.404
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO MAKE PEACE WITH ALL OF THIS.

38:55.404 --> 38:57.706
BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND,
IT'S GONNA BE

38:57.706 --> 39:00.809
ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS
I'VE EVER DONE.

39:00.809 --> 39:03.742
AND LIKE MOST THINGS
IN MY LIFE,

39:03.742 --> 39:09.748
I PROBABLY WON'T DO IT
WITH MUCH ELEGANCE OR GRACE.

39:09.748 --> 39:13.782
SO IF I DON'T COME OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE FOR COFFEE...

39:13.782 --> 39:18.086
(sighs) IF I DON'T SMILE
WHEN THE TWO OF YOU WALK BY,

39:18.086 --> 39:23.492
JUST PLEASE KNOW
THAT I STILL LOVE YOU.

39:23.492 --> 39:27.696
AND AS FOR
FORGIVING ORSON...

39:27.696 --> 39:30.899
JUST BE PATIENT.

39:30.899 --> 39:33.442
I'LL GET THERE.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.614
(whispers)
I THINK IT'S ADMIRABLE

39:45.614 --> 39:48.517
THAT YOU WANNA
FORGIVE ORSON...

39:51.019 --> 39:53.592
BECAUSE I CAN'T.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.767
(car door shuts)

39:58.767 --> 40:00.769
(engine starts)

40:10.579 --> 40:11.880
WHATCHA DOIN'?

40:11.880 --> 40:13.582
WORKING ON THE MENU

40:13.582 --> 40:15.884
FOR THE EVENT
THAT BREE AND I ARE CATERING.

40:15.884 --> 40:17.886
I HAVE TO STOP NOW
TO... (groans) PICK UP

40:17.886 --> 40:20.418
THE INVITATIONS AT THE PRINTER'S
BEFORE THEY CLOSE.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.691
I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.

40:22.691 --> 40:24.793
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
 NO, I WANT TO.

40:24.793 --> 40:28.026
MAYBE I COULD PICK UP SOME
DINNER FOR US ON THE WAY BACK.

40:28.026 --> 40:32.701
YOU KNOW, MRS. HOSKINS' DAUGHTER
BECAME NICE LIKE THIS ONCE...

40:32.701 --> 40:36.004
RIGHT BEFORE SHE BROUGHT HOME
A BOY NAMED SLASH.

40:36.004 --> 40:37.666
(chuckles) I'M BEING NICE

40:37.666 --> 40:41.069
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
A PAIN LATELY, AND...

40:41.069 --> 40:45.143
WITH ADAM GONE,
WE NEED TO BE A TEAM.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.676
IT'S JUST US NOW.

40:49.678 --> 40:50.979
(sets pen down)

40:52.150 --> 40:54.152
WHAT?

40:54.152 --> 40:58.987
IT'S JUST...

40:58.987 --> 41:04.062
IT'S LIKE YOU TURNED
INTO THIS LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN

41:04.062 --> 41:06.735
WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING.

41:11.640 --> 41:15.544
(engine idling)

41:15.544 --> 41:17.676
HEY.

41:17.676 --> 41:21.109
WE HAVE TO STOP AT THE PRINTER
ON THE WAY TO DINNER.

41:21.109 --> 41:23.812
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
SWEETHEART.

41:38.627 --> 41:40.098
THE TRUTH IS,

41:40.098 --> 41:43.772
EVERYONE BREAKS THE RULES
NOW AND THEN...

41:45.574 --> 41:47.576
WELL, WHAT YOU'VE YOU
BEEN DOING?

41:47.576 --> 41:50.879
NEVER THINKING FOR ONE SECOND
THEY MIGHT GET CAUGHT.

41:50.879 --> 41:52.581
...SOME THINGS DISAPPEAR.

41:52.581 --> 41:53.742
(both chuckle)

41:53.742 --> 41:56.715
LIKE, THAT HAPPENED
TO ME LIKE...

41:56.715 --> 41:58.587
BUT IF THEY DO,

41:58.587 --> 42:02.020
THEY SIMPLY
ASK FOR FORGIVENESS.

42:06.755 --> 42:10.729
AND MOST OF THE TIME,
THEY RECEIVE IT.

42:17.766 --> 42:20.068
BUT SOME ACTS ARE SO WICKED,

42:20.068 --> 42:23.972
THEY DEMAND ONLY
OUR CONDEMNATION.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.618
HOW DO PEOPLE AVOID
SUCH A FATE?

42:29.618 --> 42:32.080
WELL... THE TRICK IS

42:32.080 --> 42:35.754
KNOWINGWHICHRULES
ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN...

42:35.754 --> 42:37.926
AND WHICH RULES...

42:37.926 --> 42:39.928
ARE NOT.
