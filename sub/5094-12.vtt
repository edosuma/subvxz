Of the 28 cases so far,

04:38.159 --> 04:39.825
you've got street junkies,
a couple musicians,

04:39.827 --> 04:42.261
a stockbroker and
a couple of crew

04:42.263 --> 04:43.929
from some movie shoot.

04:43.931 --> 04:47.432
First report from Staten Island.

04:57.244 --> 04:58.377
Yes, sir.

04:59.746 --> 05:01.180
It's like a plague.

05:01.182 --> 05:02.814
A plague's a little different.

05:02.816 --> 05:04.216
(door closes)
How?

05:04.218 --> 05:05.884
Well, a plague,
you didn't ask for it.

05:05.886 --> 05:07.619
You think these people
asked for this?

05:07.621 --> 05:08.554
ARBOGAST:
All due respect,

05:08.556 --> 05:09.855
you stick a needle

05:09.857 --> 05:11.657
You expect to get high,
not dead.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.592
I'm just saying...

05:13.594 --> 05:15.694
Look, forget about the fact

05:15.696 --> 05:18.430
that the sale and use
of heroin is a felony.

05:18.432 --> 05:19.598
That's for later.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.366
Right now,
they're innocent victims

05:21.368 --> 05:22.768
in the eyes of this department,

05:22.770 --> 05:24.570
and we're going after the source

05:24.572 --> 05:26.638
just as we would any other

05:26.640 --> 05:28.941
imminent danger
to the population.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.545
It's a public
health emergency.

05:33.547 --> 05:35.147
It's not tainted aspirin

05:35.149 --> 05:36.915
or a bad batch of hamburger.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.250
It's pure heroin.

05:38.252 --> 05:40.719
You can't just issue
a consumer recall.

05:40.721 --> 05:42.955
We can't just sit back
and wait, either.

05:42.957 --> 05:45.123
So let's find the source.

09:20.684 --> 09:22.216
Only about a dozen.

09:22.218 --> 09:24.385
Okay, then, technically

09:24.387 --> 09:25.553
it's grand larceny.
That's a felony.

09:25.555 --> 09:27.622
But you should know
that your bag

09:27.624 --> 09:28.957
will have to be
vouchered for evidence,

09:28.959 --> 09:30.591
could be a long time
before you get it back.

09:30.593 --> 09:32.293
I have plenty of other handbags.

09:32.295 --> 09:35.129
I want her arrested.

09:36.065 --> 09:37.565
What's your name?

09:37.567 --> 09:39.767
Morgan Smith.

09:40.736 --> 09:42.770
Okay, Morgan Smith,

09:42.772 --> 09:45.406
you're under arrest
for grand larceny.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.810
(handcuffs clicking)

09:51.513 --> 09:53.648
Why isn't that CI
of yours in the box?

09:53.650 --> 09:55.717
She's not gonna do
any good in the box, Sarge.

09:55.719 --> 09:57.452
She's out on the street,
trying to get some intel.

09:57.454 --> 09:58.854
Well, I'd rather
have her in the box

09:58.855 --> 10:00.421
with the intel she already has.
What's her name?

10:00.423 --> 10:01.823
I'm not gonna
tell you her name.

10:01.825 --> 10:03.257
She's a confidential informant.

10:03.259 --> 10:04.959
That's confidential
and I gave her my word.

10:04.961 --> 10:07.528
Well, I got orders
to get any and all CI's

10:07.530 --> 10:08.963
over to Narcotics for
their own personal use.

10:08.965 --> 10:10.098
What's her name?
(phone ringing)

10:10.100 --> 10:11.466
Her name's Carmen.
This is her.

10:11.468 --> 10:12.433
I'll talk to you in a minute.

10:12.435 --> 10:13.901
(sighs)

10:13.903 --> 10:16.571
Hey, when I call you,
you pick up the phone!

10:16.573 --> 10:19.107
This is an FDNY Emergency
Medical Technician.

10:19.109 --> 10:20.208
Are you next of kin?

10:20.210 --> 10:22.143
No, this is
Detective Danny Reagan.

10:22.145 --> 10:23.277
What the hell's going on?

10:23.279 --> 10:24.712
Uh, sorry, Detective.

10:24.714 --> 10:26.180
Your number's a bunch of
missed calls on her log.

10:26.182 --> 10:27.682
Yeah, I been
calling her for hours.

10:27.684 --> 10:29.083
What is going on?

10:29.085 --> 10:30.785
Uh, she's at St. Benjamin's ER

10:30.787 --> 10:33.388
for a heroin overdose.

10:33.390 --> 10:35.123
(sighs)

10:35.125 --> 10:36.524
Is it Bogeyman?

10:36.526 --> 10:37.792
That's the evidence we have.

10:37.794 --> 10:39.894
She gonna make it?

10:39.896 --> 10:42.130
We lost her
a couple minutes ago.

10:45.567 --> 10:46.667
Detective?

10:46.669 --> 10:48.503
Yeah.

10:48.505 --> 10:50.238
Um... what's your
name again?

10:50.240 --> 10:51.339
Julietta.

10:51.341 --> 10:53.174
I need her phone for evidence,
all right?

10:53.176 --> 10:55.376
Okay.

11:07.556 --> 11:08.990
Your CI's
been doing her business

11:08.992 --> 11:10.558
on one of these sites
like Silk Road.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.627
Silk Road. What is that?
Online bazaar

11:12.629 --> 11:13.861
of all things
illegal--

11:13.863 --> 11:15.129
weapons, ammo, drugs.

11:15.131 --> 11:17.365
They deliver, like Amazon?
For sure.

11:17.367 --> 11:19.634
Except it's not books.
Look at this crap.

11:19.636 --> 11:21.536
MAN:
High octane pain relief?

11:21.538 --> 11:25.506
That's heroin. Entering
her username and password.

11:28.777 --> 11:31.045
What the...
What happened?

11:31.047 --> 11:33.414
Looks like the site's
been taken down.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.416
DANNY: What are you talking about
it's been shut down? Where'd it go?

11:35.418 --> 11:37.885
Uh, maybe their server's
been fried.

11:37.887 --> 11:39.720
Is that what you think happened?

11:39.722 --> 11:42.924
It could also be that they found
word about the deadly heroin

11:42.926 --> 11:44.692
being distributed
off their site,

11:44.694 --> 11:47.995
so they shut down virtual shop
and fled virtual town.

11:49.364 --> 11:50.898
DANNY:
They're on to us.

11:52.067 --> 11:54.202
We're back to square one.

11:58.874 --> 12:01.476
There's no better excuse
for cutting out of a benefit

12:01.478 --> 12:04.378
than a phone call
from the police commissioner.

12:04.380 --> 12:05.680
Thank you for seeing me.

12:05.682 --> 12:07.248
Drink?

12:07.250 --> 12:09.250
Love one but, no, still working.

12:09.252 --> 12:11.352
At 10:00 on a Friday night?

12:11.354 --> 12:13.421
Yes.

12:20.362 --> 12:21.963
I need your help.

12:21.965 --> 12:25.166
Please, sit down.

12:30.706 --> 12:34.208
There is a brand of heroin

12:34.210 --> 12:35.977
on the street that's
putting scores of people

12:35.979 --> 12:39.480
in the hospital, a
dozen in the morgue,

12:39.482 --> 12:42.783
and the numbers are mounting

12:42.785 --> 12:45.052
every hour goes by.

12:45.054 --> 12:46.187
Oh, my...

12:46.189 --> 12:49.624
Victims from all walks
of life, as they say.

12:49.626 --> 12:51.893
In all five boroughs.

12:51.895 --> 12:54.495
And I want it off our streets.

12:54.497 --> 12:55.830
Our streets?

12:55.832 --> 12:58.166
You consider yourself
a real New Yorker?

12:58.168 --> 13:00.034
Well, yes.

13:00.036 --> 13:02.136
Then our streets it is.

13:02.138 --> 13:04.272
(sighs)

13:04.274 --> 13:08.142
I want you to get on the horn
to your Wall Street friends,

13:08.144 --> 13:11.112
your city hall friends,
your Albany friends.

13:11.114 --> 13:13.948
I want you to take the lead

13:13.950 --> 13:15.683
in putting together a coalition

13:15.685 --> 13:18.753
with the purpose
of raising the cash necessary

13:18.755 --> 13:21.556
to buy this heroin
off the streets.

13:21.558 --> 13:22.590
Immediately.

13:22.592 --> 13:23.591
You're kidding.

13:23.593 --> 13:25.159
Not in the least.

13:25.161 --> 13:27.828
And get your friends
in the DA's office to offer

13:27.830 --> 13:30.598
total amnesty.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.633
City hall will handle
the health department

13:32.635 --> 13:36.204
and in whatever is efficient
to effect the...

13:36.206 --> 13:38.139
The buyback?

13:38.141 --> 13:40.641
I honestly don't know
what the hell to call it.

13:40.643 --> 13:42.710
And, yes, I am...

13:42.712 --> 13:45.046
operating without
the instruments here.

13:45.048 --> 13:46.214
A little.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.748
More than a little.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.917
People are dropping
left and right.

13:49.919 --> 13:53.554
There is no precedent,
at least in my experience.

13:53.556 --> 13:56.290
No precedent
for your solution either.

13:57.125 --> 14:00.061
Why don't I make the calls
myself?

14:00.063 --> 14:02.196
And then there's that.

14:03.031 --> 14:05.366
Because, as the P.C.,

14:05.368 --> 14:07.335
I have to have utter faith

14:07.337 --> 14:09.537
that the men and women
in my department

14:09.539 --> 14:11.505
will get this poison
off the street.

14:11.507 --> 14:14.842
But as a closet humanitarian,
you want to hedge that bet.

14:14.844 --> 14:18.379
They are the finest police
department on the planet.

14:18.381 --> 14:20.648
But they carry guns and shields,

14:20.650 --> 14:23.317
not magic wands.

14:23.319 --> 14:25.753
And lives are at stake.

14:28.523 --> 14:30.358
What do you say?

14:32.227 --> 14:33.761
(sighs)

14:33.763 --> 14:35.830
Here's the catch.

14:35.832 --> 14:37.965
I could make some calls,

14:37.967 --> 14:41.369
but the people on the other end
will call me a lunatic.

14:41.371 --> 14:43.804
And if I say the idea
came from you,

14:43.806 --> 14:47.375
that cancels the whole thing
of you being invisible in this.

14:47.377 --> 14:50.344
Lots of good ideas
were called lunacy at first.

14:50.346 --> 14:54.048
Lots of bad ones, too,
for lots of good reasons.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.184
(sighs)
You have my cell.

14:57.186 --> 15:00.054
I'll look forward
to hearing from you.

15:00.056 --> 15:01.322
(sighs)

15:01.324 --> 15:04.091
I can't promise
you'll like what you hear.

15:05.827 --> 15:08.529
Thanks for the ear.

15:31.623 --> 15:33.691
JANKO:
Morgan Stallings,

15:33.693 --> 15:35.159
not Smith.

15:35.161 --> 15:38.829
Of Hayrake Lane
in Chappaqua, New York.

15:38.831 --> 15:40.998
It's Smith.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.134
And where's Chappaqua?

15:43.136 --> 15:45.002
In Westchester.

15:45.004 --> 15:47.972
Where the state police have
a database of fake IDs,

15:47.974 --> 15:49.440
which you've been in
since you were busted

15:49.442 --> 15:50.441
for underage drinking

15:50.443 --> 15:52.643
in Mount Kisco last summer.

15:53.512 --> 15:56.013
Yeah, says you.

15:56.015 --> 15:58.416
What are you running away from?

15:58.418 --> 16:00.117
What do you got?

16:01.153 --> 16:04.488
Lamb chop, I'm trying
to do you a favor here.

16:04.490 --> 16:06.991
Once I send you down
to Central Booking,

16:06.993 --> 16:08.492
it's out of my hands.

16:08.494 --> 16:10.861
I didn't ask you for a favor.

16:10.863 --> 16:12.663
Yeah, I know. I know.

16:12.665 --> 16:14.899
I'm gonna try
and do you one anyway.

16:15.734 --> 16:17.568
Why?

16:17.570 --> 16:20.371
'Cause a couple of cops
did me a favor once,

16:20.373 --> 16:22.807
and, you know what,
it made all the difference.

16:25.844 --> 16:28.713
Sarge says you can keep
her here till end of tour.

16:28.715 --> 16:32.183
Hey. You got a couple
hours to get smart.

16:32.185 --> 16:33.417
Whoopee.

16:33.419 --> 16:35.419
Let's just ship her.

16:35.421 --> 16:37.154
Wow. Good cop, bad cop.

16:37.156 --> 16:38.522
Who saw that coming?

16:38.524 --> 16:40.691
Let's roll.

16:49.101 --> 16:50.801
DANNY:
<i>Yeah, but I'm not one</i>

16:50.803 --> 16:52.970
of the detectives
who was here last night.

16:52.972 --> 16:55.973
My point being, they wrote down
everything we have to offer.

16:55.975 --> 16:57.508
My point being,
I got an eyewitness

16:57.510 --> 16:58.843
who puts Lacey in the room

16:58.845 --> 17:00.845
with the victims,
hiding the drugs

17:00.847 --> 17:02.079
and wiping down a crime scene,

17:02.081 --> 17:04.015
which is tampering
with physical evidence,

17:04.017 --> 17:05.816
a felony, for starters.

17:05.818 --> 17:07.284
Who's the eyewitness?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.954
Never mind that.

17:09.955 --> 17:12.390
Lacey, this is the police.

17:12.392 --> 17:14.392
MAN: Honey, if there's
more to tell,

17:14.394 --> 17:16.027
just spit it out,

17:17.396 --> 17:20.031
Lacey doesn't take hard drugs,

17:20.032 --> 17:21.632
if that's what
you're insinuating.

17:21.634 --> 17:23.233
Right.

17:23.236 --> 17:25.136
I noticed you walk
with a limp, Lacey.

17:25.137 --> 17:27.538
Do you... have an injury
or something?

17:27.540 --> 17:30.541
I tore my ACL,
playing lacrosse.

17:30.543 --> 17:32.209
Right. You have the operation?

17:32.211 --> 17:34.245
Twice.

17:34.247 --> 17:36.147
Do you get prescribed Oxy
for the pain?

17:36.149 --> 17:37.314
MAN:
She was. What's that have

17:37.316 --> 17:38.816
to do with it?
Well, just a guess here,

17:38.818 --> 17:41.485
but the prescription
for the Oxys ran out,

17:41.487 --> 17:43.788
but the craving
for hi-test

17:43.790 --> 17:45.322
pain relief didn't.

17:45.324 --> 17:46.490
I've heard enough.

17:46.492 --> 17:47.858
Well, I haven't.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.428
And heroin will make Oxys
look like children's aspirin.

17:50.430 --> 17:51.662
MAN:
That's enough.

17:51.664 --> 17:53.431
I'm calling our lawyer.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.332
You call your lawyer
if you want, Mr. Sutherland,

17:55.334 --> 17:57.935
but she will be charged and she
will be arraigned, and Lacey's

17:57.937 --> 17:59.804
big, bright future
will become real cloudy

17:59.806 --> 18:02.106
real fast.
Or she can simply

18:02.108 --> 18:05.543
give me her dealer
and you will never see me again.

18:05.545 --> 18:07.678
You follow me?

18:09.214 --> 18:10.614
And my offer

18:10.616 --> 18:12.983
expires in ten seconds.
And, I got to tell you,

18:12.985 --> 18:15.319
I'm not gonna stand here
counting like an idiot.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.390
His name's Bruce Garrity.

18:19.392 --> 18:21.459
He's my physical therapist.

18:21.461 --> 18:23.694
Lacey...
Shut up, Mom.

18:23.696 --> 18:25.329
Let the lawyers handle this.

18:25.331 --> 18:27.264
Shut up, Dad.

18:28.467 --> 18:31.001
Address?

18:35.440 --> 18:39.243
As of an hour ago,
we had 18 confirmed deaths

18:39.245 --> 18:42.446
and somewhere around
40 emergency room admissions

18:42.448 --> 18:44.318
that we're attributing
to this Bogeyman.

18:44.343 --> 18:45.350
REPORTER: Somewhere around?

18:45.351 --> 18:47.184
That's a hard number?

18:47.186 --> 18:49.320
Well, we're tallying this number
based on interviews,

18:49.322 --> 18:52.089
but some of the interviewees
are not fully conscious, so...

18:52.091 --> 18:53.624
Commissioner!
the Department of Health

18:53.626 --> 18:56.560
can better answer
the confirmed cases,

18:56.562 --> 18:59.964
which at this time is still
increasing, not abating.

18:59.966 --> 19:01.899
Commissioner, can you update us
on the NYPD's progress

19:01.901 --> 19:03.067
in tracking down the source?

19:03.069 --> 19:04.969
We've got all our resources

19:04.971 --> 19:07.271
doing everything they can,
along with the DEA.

19:07.273 --> 19:08.305
That's it?

19:08.307 --> 19:10.908
It's police work,
not the stock market.

19:10.910 --> 19:13.077
We don't have minute
by minute results.

19:13.079 --> 19:15.279
But you do have minute by minute
casualties here.

19:15.281 --> 19:17.148
I'm well aware of that.
There's rumor

19:17.150 --> 19:19.016
of some kind of buyback program
in the works.

19:23.822 --> 19:27.091
The rumor press conference
is down the street.

19:27.093 --> 19:29.326
Well, what's your stand
on some version

19:29.328 --> 19:30.961
of a heroin-for-cash scenario

19:30.963 --> 19:32.563
to get this Bogeyman
off the streets?

19:32.565 --> 19:34.265
You're asking me
to address a rumor.

19:34.267 --> 19:36.567
The answer is I won't.

19:36.569 --> 19:39.370
We'll have an update at 8:00.
Thank you, everyone.

19:39.372 --> 19:40.704
Thank you.

19:40.706 --> 19:42.940
(reporters clamoring)
(quietly): Find Kelly Peterson.

19:42.942 --> 19:46.177
What for?
A chat.

19:56.054 --> 19:59.390
Wait, you have a separate
pile for party schools?

19:59.392 --> 20:03.060
It's not separate. I'm just
trying to stay organized.

20:03.062 --> 20:05.896
How would you even know?

20:05.898 --> 20:07.832
I did my research.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.300
What about Villanova?

20:09.302 --> 20:11.268
I have friends who went
and loved it.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.671
Yeah, except now it's
called "Villa No Fun."

20:13.673 --> 20:15.806
Plus, it's Catholic.

20:15.808 --> 20:17.975
It's not Catholic-Catholic.

20:17.977 --> 20:19.376
We agreed.
That it didn't

20:19.378 --> 20:22.413
have to be Catholic, not that
it couldn't be Catholic.

20:22.415 --> 20:24.281
But it's not going to be.

20:24.283 --> 20:26.250
Look, I've
had 14 years

20:26.252 --> 20:28.986
of parochial school. I'm not
planning on becoming a priest.

20:28.988 --> 20:31.055
You can't be a priest.

20:31.057 --> 20:32.223
My point exactly.

20:32.225 --> 20:33.390
Enough.

20:34.159 --> 20:36.927
What is with the attitude,
Nicky?

20:36.929 --> 20:39.830
I just want
to make my own choices.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.299
What's with yours?

20:42.301 --> 20:45.502
I am trying to guide you.

20:49.341 --> 20:51.976
Mom, look at me.

20:51.978 --> 20:54.778
(sighs, mutters)

20:54.780 --> 20:57.114
I went to a party,

20:57.116 --> 20:59.550
and some kids there,
who I didn't know,

20:59.552 --> 21:01.752
used heroin and OD'd.

21:02.654 --> 21:06.257
I called an ambulance,
talked to the police

21:06.259 --> 21:08.158
and told you everything
later that night.

21:08.160 --> 21:11.528
In other words, I did everything
you would have wanted me to do,

21:11.530 --> 21:14.665
everything you guided me to do.

21:16.968 --> 21:19.937
Are you afraid that, say,
if I were to see a wreck

21:19.939 --> 21:21.338
on the highway, I'd want to get

21:21.340 --> 21:23.173
into a wreck on the highway? Okay,
No.

21:23.175 --> 21:24.808
so what are you afraid of here?

21:29.681 --> 21:31.348
Nothing.

21:32.284 --> 21:34.685
So can we please lose
the party pile then?

21:34.687 --> 21:36.153
Yeah. Sure.

21:36.155 --> 21:37.588
There you go. Have at it.

21:37.590 --> 21:40.724
(sighs)
Mom...

21:44.095 --> 21:46.263
(sighs)

21:50.902 --> 21:53.037
(door creaks)
DANNY: <i>Police.</i>

21:53.039 --> 21:55.472
(meditative music playing)

21:55.474 --> 21:57.641
Garrity?

22:00.912 --> 22:03.113
Garrity?

22:04.816 --> 22:07.017
Police!

22:10.355 --> 22:12.856
And another one
bites the dust.

22:14.659 --> 22:16.527
I don't get it.
What?

22:16.529 --> 22:18.195
The guy was
dealing poison.

22:18.197 --> 22:19.964
It must have
gotten back to him.

22:19.966 --> 22:21.799
Why would he shoot
it up himself?

22:21.801 --> 22:23.367
Well, it'd be hard
for his customers

22:23.369 --> 22:25.769
to file a complaint against
a local dealer when, uh,

22:25.771 --> 22:27.705
you're dead, too.

22:27.707 --> 22:29.473
Somebody would have called him.
Seen the news?

22:29.475 --> 22:31.275
He's pretty ripe.

22:31.277 --> 22:33.277
How long you think?

22:33.279 --> 22:35.512
I don't know. My nose
isn't that trained,

22:35.514 --> 22:37.247
but I'd say it's
been a while.

22:37.249 --> 22:38.782
See if there's some liniment
over there and turn down

22:38.784 --> 22:40.918
that music,
would you?

22:40.920 --> 22:42.519
(music stops)

22:53.665 --> 22:57.234
Danny, I got something.

22:57.236 --> 22:58.969
Yeah? I hope
it's some Tiger Balm.

22:58.971 --> 23:01.505
Suicide note

23:01.507 --> 23:03.807
with his keys,
wallet and a receipt

23:03.809 --> 23:05.943
for his veterinarian.
He boarded his dog first.

23:05.945 --> 23:06.977
What does it say?

23:06.979 --> 23:09.646
"To the friends I harmed,
I am sorry.

23:09.648 --> 23:10.981
"To my DSS brothers,

23:10.983 --> 23:13.117
I am ashamed of
what we have done."

23:13.119 --> 23:15.252
DSS?

23:17.188 --> 23:20.357
(phone buzzing)

23:20.359 --> 23:22.559
Hear that phone?

23:24.929 --> 23:27.064
Over there?

23:32.070 --> 23:34.138
Jimmy.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.240
Jimmy?

23:36.242 --> 23:38.809
Uh, you there?

23:38.811 --> 23:40.577
Jimmy, we-we got
problems, buddy.

23:40.579 --> 23:42.079
JIMMY:
Bruce?

23:42.081 --> 23:43.947
Uh, y-yeah. Y-You
sound different.

23:43.949 --> 23:46.350
Oh, you got me on speaker
or something?

23:46.352 --> 23:47.885
Bad connection.

23:47.887 --> 23:50.487
Uh, yeah.
Hey, what are we gonna do, man?

23:50.489 --> 23:53.157
We're rounding it all up
to recut it.

23:53.159 --> 23:55.059
Not on the phone, okay?
Can you meet?

23:55.061 --> 23:57.294
I'm coming to you.
Give me a half hour.

23:57.296 --> 23:59.129
All right.
He's on his way.

23:59.131 --> 24:00.898
Call for backup?
No, no.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.132
I was afraid you were gonna
say that.

24:02.134 --> 24:04.234
Listen, he said,
<i>"We'll</i> round it up."

24:04.236 --> 24:05.569
All right? We
got to find out

24:05.571 --> 24:06.970
who "we" is.
If we just get Jimmy,

24:06.972 --> 24:09.106
then all we get is Jimmy.
This is a lot bigger than him.

24:09.108 --> 24:10.474
We ain't got time for
lawyers and paperwork.

24:10.476 --> 24:13.477
Let's give this place a toss
before he gets here.

24:29.732 --> 24:31.533
Last chance, Morgan.

24:31.535 --> 24:32.634
For what?

24:32.636 --> 24:34.403
For me to help you.

24:35.738 --> 24:38.774
If I call your house,
who answers the phone?

24:38.776 --> 24:40.976
Either the bitch or the bastard.

24:40.978 --> 24:42.444
Mom and Dad?

24:42.446 --> 24:44.980
Stepdad.

24:45.815 --> 24:48.083
Is that why you ran away?

24:51.087 --> 24:54.223
Is there something sexual
that I need to know about?

24:54.225 --> 24:56.825
I don't know.
I've never been to bed with you.

24:56.827 --> 24:58.293
I meant...

24:58.295 --> 25:00.529
I know what you meant.
Take a joke?

25:00.531 --> 25:02.664
Okay, time's up.

25:02.666 --> 25:04.666
Come on. Hey.

25:04.668 --> 25:06.235
I'm taking her
to Central Booking.

25:06.237 --> 25:08.770
What does that mean?

25:09.806 --> 25:11.607
He's taking you to
your arraignment.

25:11.609 --> 25:12.975
Get up.

25:12.977 --> 25:14.476
Wait...
Let's go.

25:15.878 --> 25:17.746
(handcuffs clicking)
Can you get me out of it?

25:17.748 --> 25:19.581
No can do.

25:19.583 --> 25:21.550
Let's go.

25:21.552 --> 25:24.019
Wait. Please! Come on.

25:24.021 --> 25:25.621
I was just messing with you.

25:25.623 --> 25:26.722
Whatever you do,

25:26.724 --> 25:28.724
don't use that fake ID
on the judge.

25:28.726 --> 25:30.092
Where's the real one?

25:33.830 --> 25:35.464
It's in my underwear.

25:35.466 --> 25:37.132
Have it on you.

25:37.134 --> 25:38.967
Officer? Could you take her

25:38.969 --> 25:41.069
to the car out front
for me, please?

25:41.071 --> 25:42.404
I'll be right out.

25:42.406 --> 25:44.072
Thank you.

25:45.008 --> 25:46.575
(sighs)

25:46.577 --> 25:49.177
Hey, as my father told me,

25:49.179 --> 25:51.046
you can't save every puppy
in the pound.

25:51.048 --> 25:53.048
Yeah, I know that.

25:53.050 --> 25:54.383
So, why her?

25:54.385 --> 25:58.153
Oh, because I know that girl.

25:58.155 --> 26:01.156
I <i>was</i> that girl, you know?

26:01.158 --> 26:03.892
Some nights,
I still am that girl.

26:07.797 --> 26:09.831
All right,
let's roll.

26:09.833 --> 26:12.301
(horns honking)

26:13.136 --> 26:15.337
(papers rustling)

26:20.443 --> 26:22.444
(clattering)

26:25.348 --> 26:28.150
Bingo. Found the stash.

26:28.152 --> 26:30.352
Look at this.

26:33.273 --> 26:35.574
Reagan, look at this.

26:37.994 --> 26:41.646
Look at the T-shirts
they're all wearing.

26:41.648 --> 26:43.648
Darktide Security Services, DSS.

26:43.650 --> 26:45.801
What is that?

26:45.803 --> 26:47.703
They're private sector
contractors used in Iraq,

26:47.705 --> 26:49.104
and for medical support

26:49.106 --> 26:50.339
on our bases
in Germany.

26:50.341 --> 26:52.708
They have access to all
the medical supply chains.

26:52.710 --> 26:54.843
Medicine comes in,
heroin comes out.

26:54.845 --> 26:56.211
Like Bogeyman.

26:56.213 --> 26:57.629
You're guessing?

26:57.631 --> 26:59.882
Look, it's not that much
of a stretch, trust me.

26:59.884 --> 27:02.050
So, what are we
dealing with?

27:02.052 --> 27:04.386
They call themselves
Soldiers of Fortune.

27:04.388 --> 27:06.138
What do other
people call them?

27:06.140 --> 27:08.824
Rent-A-Grunts,
but trust me, they're dangerous.

27:08.826 --> 27:11.009
(intercom beeps)

27:14.864 --> 27:17.032
(beeps)

27:20.870 --> 27:22.454
Yeah.

27:22.456 --> 27:23.989
Jimmy.

27:23.991 --> 27:25.190
Jimmy and?

27:25.192 --> 27:26.358
Come on, it's just me.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.960
Good. Come on up.

27:27.962 --> 27:29.995
(buzzer sounds)

27:29.997 --> 27:32.131
Let's have some fun.

27:36.252 --> 27:38.937
FRANK: <i>You could've just told me</i>
<i>to take a hike.</i>

27:38.939 --> 27:41.640
But to leak it so I get
ambush by the press?

27:41.642 --> 27:43.425
I'll take a
flat no any day.

27:43.427 --> 27:44.426
I didn't leak it.

27:44.428 --> 27:46.044
I know how this goes.

27:46.046 --> 27:49.014
I just didn't know how it go
between you and me.

27:49.016 --> 27:50.516
I said I didn't leak it.

27:50.518 --> 27:53.402
If you came all the way
over here to harass me...

27:53.404 --> 27:55.103
Well, some sentiment
just can't be conveyed

27:55.105 --> 27:56.438
over the phone, you know?

27:56.440 --> 27:59.057
For the last time, it wasn't me!

27:59.059 --> 28:01.693
I took a look
at your records in Essex County.

28:01.695 --> 28:04.246
You went after drug offenses
like a hanging judge.

28:04.248 --> 28:05.697
So?

28:05.699 --> 28:07.583
You were never going
to support me.

28:08.701 --> 28:10.919
At least you could have been
upfront about it.

28:10.921 --> 28:13.572
I was pretty clear about it.

28:13.574 --> 28:15.073
Oh, please.
And,

28:15.075 --> 28:17.926
as a matter of fact,
I did try to sell it,

28:17.928 --> 28:20.095
for a New York minute,
and only out

28:20.097 --> 28:23.565
of some misguided sense
of being an ally to you

28:23.567 --> 28:26.251
and your department
in the midst of a crisis.

28:26.253 --> 28:28.737
And then I came back
to my senses.

28:28.739 --> 28:32.107
Your one-strike, lock-'em-up,
throw-away-the-key type senses?

28:33.893 --> 28:37.279
I spoke with Bridget Rawlings
in the health department

28:37.281 --> 28:40.032
and Eddie Castellano
in the mayor's office.

28:40.034 --> 28:42.201
So why don't you go ruin
their Saturday afternoons,

28:42.203 --> 28:44.820
see which one of them talked
to the press?

28:46.623 --> 28:48.940
And next time
you need a beard

28:48.942 --> 28:50.959
for pandering to the
criminal classes,

28:50.961 --> 28:52.744
call someone else.

28:52.746 --> 28:56.415
Did you ever risk anything

28:56.417 --> 28:59.184
for any cause but your own?

28:59.186 --> 29:01.086
(sighs)

29:01.088 --> 29:03.422
You son of a bitch!

29:14.100 --> 29:16.568
(groaning)

29:16.570 --> 29:18.153
DANNY:
Wake up, Jimmy.

29:18.155 --> 29:19.438
Come on, get up.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.972
What the hell?

29:20.974 --> 29:22.624
(clattering)

29:22.626 --> 29:25.810
(yelling)

29:27.080 --> 29:28.697
DANNY:
Hey.

29:28.699 --> 29:30.582
Settle down. He's been

29:30.584 --> 29:31.667
dead a while.
You don't want

29:31.669 --> 29:32.718
his arm fag off on you.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.337
(groaning)
Stop fidgeting.

29:35.339 --> 29:36.939
He's leaking, all right?
You're gonna make a mess.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.640
(panting rapidly)
Who are you?

29:38.642 --> 29:39.791
Who are you?

29:39.793 --> 29:41.176
Jimmy Delaney.

29:41.178 --> 29:42.994
Jimmy Delaney,
who are you affiliated with?

29:42.996 --> 29:44.846
Nobody. Ow!

29:44.848 --> 29:46.515
Jimmy?
Who are you?

29:46.517 --> 29:48.333
Well, we're affiliated
with the police, Jimmy.

29:48.335 --> 29:51.003
I'm gonna ask you one last time,
who are you affiliated with?

29:51.005 --> 29:53.171
You got nothing.

29:53.173 --> 29:55.357
I got a dead informant,
Jimmy Delaney.

29:55.359 --> 29:58.477
<i>She's</i> dead because <i>she</i> sampled
some of that poison

29:58.479 --> 30:00.979
you guys are pumping
out there on the streets.

30:00.981 --> 30:02.864
And I took that
very personally, okay?

30:02.866 --> 30:04.449
Now,

30:04.451 --> 30:06.785
I'm very determined
to put an end to that stuff.

30:06.787 --> 30:08.820
And you're gonna help us
do that, you understand?

30:08.822 --> 30:10.855
In exchange for what?

30:10.857 --> 30:13.325
In exchange for us not taking
a syringe and pumping your arm

30:13.327 --> 30:14.960
full of that garbage.

30:14.962 --> 30:16.144
You can't do that.
You're a cop.

30:16.146 --> 30:17.496
You're handcuffed
to a corpse, Jimmy.

30:17.498 --> 30:18.647
You're really gonna question

30:18.649 --> 30:20.399
what levels
we'll go to right now?

30:20.401 --> 30:21.650
Up yours.

30:21.652 --> 30:23.752
(bone crunching)
(groaning)

30:23.754 --> 30:25.253
Partner?

30:29.058 --> 30:33.878
Now, two dealers OD'ing on a
sample of their own supply is

30:33.880 --> 30:35.314
really not gonna cause
any ripples

30:35.316 --> 30:36.598
in the grand scheme of things.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.049
You understand what I'm saying?

30:39.936 --> 30:41.069
No! No! No! No! Wait!

30:41.071 --> 30:42.204
Wait.

30:42.206 --> 30:43.888
(Jimmy pants loudly)

30:43.890 --> 30:45.991
Who are you affiliated with?

30:46.959 --> 30:48.560
Ow! Ow.

30:48.562 --> 30:49.894
Who are you affiliated with?

30:49.896 --> 30:51.446
Some guys worked

30:51.448 --> 30:53.699
with military contractors
overseas.

30:55.251 --> 30:57.786
Where's the motherlode?
It's mobile.

30:57.788 --> 30:59.070
What does that mean,
it's mobile?

30:59.072 --> 31:00.071
It means it's in a vehicle

31:00.073 --> 31:01.173
that's on the move.

31:01.175 --> 31:02.240
What do you think it means?

31:02.242 --> 31:03.842
Good. I need
a description and plates.

31:03.844 --> 31:05.910
No, no. I'm not giving you
anything else

31:05.912 --> 31:07.912
until you get me down
to your station

31:07.914 --> 31:09.264
in front of other people.

31:09.266 --> 31:10.465
You're insane.

31:10.467 --> 31:11.717
(Jimmy pants loudly)

31:11.719 --> 31:14.102
Okay.

31:16.439 --> 31:18.440
Hang back one second.

31:18.442 --> 31:20.942
Let me make sure
it's cool.

31:22.478 --> 31:24.062
(vehicle engine accelerating)

31:24.064 --> 31:25.147
(tires squealing)

31:25.149 --> 31:27.566
We got company.

31:42.189 --> 31:45.006
Get inside! Get inside!

31:45.208 --> 31:47.009
Door's locked.

31:50.597 --> 31:52.347
Move!

31:56.019 --> 31:58.720
Move it!

32:00.240 --> 32:01.740
Aah. Ow.

32:01.742 --> 32:03.859
Shut him up!

32:03.861 --> 32:05.911
(sighs)
Ow!

32:05.913 --> 32:08.547
Hey. You cover this one.
Use him for a shield.

32:08.549 --> 32:11.399
Wait. What?
Shut up!

32:13.336 --> 32:15.037
We need a 10-13
at the corner

32:15.039 --> 32:16.255
of Lee and Halsey.

32:16.257 --> 32:18.757
Shots fired.
No, we got shots fired!

32:18.759 --> 32:20.408
Listen.

32:20.410 --> 32:21.960
They might be coming in.

32:21.962 --> 32:23.629
Keep your ear open
for the glass, all right?

32:23.631 --> 32:25.314
Uh-huh.

32:25.316 --> 32:26.882
(glass tinkling)

32:26.884 --> 32:28.250
(panting loudly)

32:46.536 --> 32:47.703
Jimmy, let's go!

32:51.040 --> 32:52.941
Jimmy!
No, no, no, no!

32:54.277 --> 32:55.460
(grunts)

32:55.462 --> 32:57.579
(gun chamber clicking)

32:58.548 --> 33:00.282
(gun chamber clicking)
(sighs)

33:01.450 --> 33:02.801
Mike, Mike,
she's out.

33:02.803 --> 33:04.169
She's empty.

33:05.305 --> 33:07.506
She's empty. She's empty.
Come on.

33:11.477 --> 33:13.512
(gunshots)

33:19.686 --> 33:21.353
You okay?

33:21.355 --> 33:23.021
Yeah.

33:35.268 --> 33:36.835
(whistles)

33:39.622 --> 33:41.006
Come here.

33:45.995 --> 33:49.298
So our CO gave us permission
to take you up

33:49.300 --> 33:50.599
and drop you off at home.

33:50.601 --> 33:51.833
Why are you doing that?

33:51.835 --> 33:54.019
Because if I take you
to the train station,

33:54.021 --> 33:56.021
you probably have
friends or boyfriends

33:56.023 --> 33:59.007
at, say, Tuckahoe Station.

33:59.009 --> 34:00.309
You're just gonna get off.

34:00.311 --> 34:02.477
So?

34:03.696 --> 34:06.565
So you've seen the
house of detention.

34:06.567 --> 34:09.618
I think next you need to see
your house in Chappaqua.

34:09.620 --> 34:12.321
Consider them
side by side.

34:12.322 --> 34:13.487
And if you still

34:13.489 --> 34:16.123
want to screw
up your life...

34:16.126 --> 34:18.710
at least I know I
did what I could.

34:24.967 --> 34:26.168
She's all right.

34:26.170 --> 34:28.170
Yeah, she is.

34:28.172 --> 34:29.388
Road trip, yay!

34:29.389 --> 34:31.172
Hey, Morgan, get in the car.

34:33.059 --> 34:34.208
I'm never having kids.

34:34.210 --> 34:35.811
Just so you know.

34:42.418 --> 34:45.120
There were five kilos
in the van itself.

34:45.121 --> 34:47.688
Parallel investigation
seized five more kilos

34:47.690 --> 34:50.158
from a boat off City Island.
Weapons?

34:50.159 --> 34:52.194
Cache on the boat.
Heavy ordinance.

34:52.196 --> 34:54.880
Any reason to think there's
more of the brand out there?

34:54.905 --> 34:55.731
No, sir.

34:55.732 --> 34:58.116
All indications are that the
syndicate were in the end stages

34:58.118 --> 34:59.701
of pulling the product
off the street

34:59.703 --> 35:01.069
to recut and redistribute,

35:01.071 --> 35:02.904
per Delaney,
the guy we broke.

35:02.906 --> 35:04.873
Put all the booty together
for a photo op,

35:04.875 --> 35:05.841
full-on Christmas morning,

35:05.843 --> 35:07.843
all the presents
on display.

35:07.845 --> 35:09.978
With you and who else?
Not me, the Chief of Narcotics

35:09.980 --> 35:12.998
and the teams
of detectives who cracked it.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.383
You should be there.

35:14.385 --> 35:15.851
No.

35:16.803 --> 35:17.769
(drums fingers on desk)

35:17.771 --> 35:19.087
Thank you.

35:20.306 --> 35:21.773
Dino.

35:25.194 --> 35:27.429
Good work.

35:27.431 --> 35:29.581
Thank you, sir.

35:32.885 --> 35:35.103
(door closes)

35:37.040 --> 35:38.824
I don't have
a definitive answer.

35:38.826 --> 35:41.727
It could have
been Kelly.

35:41.729 --> 35:43.378
It could have been...
Castellano.

35:43.380 --> 35:45.414
In the mayor's office.

35:45.416 --> 35:46.415
Who's your money on?

35:46.417 --> 35:48.300
When Eddie Castellano was a kid,

35:48.302 --> 35:51.586
the other kids called him
"Anonymous Source."

35:53.306 --> 35:54.556
Sir, a fax just came for you

35:54.558 --> 35:56.091
from the colonel of the
Connecticut State Troopers.

35:56.093 --> 35:57.259
It's the autopsy
and accident report

35:57.261 --> 36:00.128
of Kelly Peterson's
son, Brandon.

36:00.130 --> 36:01.596
Thank you, Baker.

36:04.350 --> 36:07.202
He died in a car crash
in '08, we knew that.

36:07.204 --> 36:09.071
(door closes)

36:09.073 --> 36:10.939
(sighs)

36:12.308 --> 36:14.626
That's <i>all</i> we knew.

36:16.863 --> 36:19.398
Have a good weekend, Garrett.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.285
What's left of it.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.672
I'll see you Monday, boss.

36:28.541 --> 36:30.759
(door opens, closes)

36:41.921 --> 36:44.639
I guess she really
did have to pee.

36:44.641 --> 36:45.840
You know?
Yeah.

36:45.842 --> 36:48.777
Probably too scared
to go in the jail.

36:48.779 --> 36:50.362
Want to go in and check on her?

36:50.364 --> 36:53.532
In a sec.

36:53.534 --> 36:55.016
You know it's a good thing;

36:55.018 --> 36:57.152
what we're doing here.

36:57.154 --> 36:58.703
Yeah, it is.

36:58.705 --> 37:00.372
You want to go
check on her?

37:00.374 --> 37:01.706
Like what we sign up for.

37:01.708 --> 37:02.824
You know?

37:02.826 --> 37:04.075
Making a difference.

37:04.077 --> 37:08.029
If I can help one person
get back on the right path,

37:08.031 --> 37:09.414
then...

37:09.416 --> 37:10.999
I'm doing my job.

37:11.001 --> 37:13.218
You know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.

37:13.220 --> 37:14.886
Yeah.

37:14.888 --> 37:16.421
I do, and I...

37:16.423 --> 37:20.175
I hope you get to experience
that someday, I really do.

37:20.177 --> 37:22.427
You're not even listening.

37:23.596 --> 37:26.648
Seeing this through
with young Morgan in there?

37:26.650 --> 37:29.717
It's... it's giving me
that good feeling.

37:30.937 --> 37:32.737
Yeah, well, the thing is...

37:32.739 --> 37:34.272
young Morgan?

37:34.274 --> 37:36.691
Just took off with two
dudes in a red Camaro.

37:36.693 --> 37:37.826
She must have texted them.

37:37.828 --> 37:39.861
Get out.
Mm.

37:39.863 --> 37:41.730
Where?

37:41.732 --> 37:42.747
She went that way.

37:42.749 --> 37:44.032
Yeah.

37:44.034 --> 37:45.116
Well, let's go after her.

37:45.118 --> 37:46.234
On what charge?

37:46.236 --> 37:48.870
(scoffs)
Punking you?

37:50.039 --> 37:51.239
Oh!

37:51.241 --> 37:52.457
(laughs)
Come on.

37:53.593 --> 37:56.077
(exasperated sigh)

37:56.079 --> 37:57.879
Does she still
remind you of you?

37:57.881 --> 37:59.931
Hey.

37:59.933 --> 38:02.801
I'm gonna need you to try...

38:02.803 --> 38:05.253
try not to enjoy this too much.

38:13.646 --> 38:16.264
So where are we
with the college search?

38:19.368 --> 38:21.453
Or not.

38:21.455 --> 38:22.937
We're kind of going
in different directions.

38:22.939 --> 38:24.272
I wouldn't
say that.

38:24.790 --> 38:25.824
My top three
choices

38:25.826 --> 38:27.626
are Stanford--

38:27.628 --> 38:29.661
which is the reach--

38:29.663 --> 38:31.796
Duke and Vanderbilt.

38:31.798 --> 38:33.798
Stanford's in California.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.800
Yes.

38:35.802 --> 38:37.636
All great schools, Pop.

38:37.638 --> 38:39.287
Yeah, but all a plane ride away.

38:39.289 --> 38:40.455
It's just by coincidence.

38:40.457 --> 38:42.424
Coincidence.
Yes.

38:42.426 --> 38:43.675
Nothing in the northeast?

38:43.677 --> 38:45.644
You wouldn't even
consider Harvard, Nicky?

38:45.646 --> 38:47.295
More like I don't think
Harvard would consider me.

38:47.297 --> 38:48.630
Nah, if you're
shooting for Stanford,

38:48.632 --> 38:50.465
then Harvard should be on the list.
Yeah.

38:50.467 --> 38:51.683
She wants
to be away.

38:51.685 --> 38:53.518
Mom.

38:53.520 --> 38:54.986
I think it's
great, Nicky.

38:54.988 --> 38:57.522
I mean, we're
gonna miss you.

38:57.524 --> 38:58.490
Not just your mom,

38:58.492 --> 39:00.242
but all of us.

39:00.244 --> 39:01.826
And I'm gonna miss all of you.

39:02.662 --> 39:03.811
And...

39:03.813 --> 39:04.963
nothing's definite,
obviously,

39:04.965 --> 39:06.331
but I...

39:06.333 --> 39:08.083
(sighs)

39:09.652 --> 39:12.820
Can we please just change the
subject before I start crying?

39:13.589 --> 39:15.540
Nicky wants
to go someplace big,

39:15.542 --> 39:17.292
and new, and...

39:17.294 --> 39:18.760
far enough away
that she can feel like

39:18.762 --> 39:20.545
she's truly on her own.
Mm...

39:20.547 --> 39:22.163
I remember that feeling.

39:22.165 --> 39:23.331
You do?
Yeah.

39:23.333 --> 39:24.999
I ended up
in the middle of Iraq.

39:25.001 --> 39:26.268
In a war.

39:26.270 --> 39:29.087
Can't say I recommend it.

39:29.089 --> 39:30.438
And I'm having...

39:30.440 --> 39:32.807
trouble dealing with it.

39:32.809 --> 39:34.192
Okay?

39:35.027 --> 39:37.612
Columbia was
plenty big and new

39:37.614 --> 39:40.699
and far away to me.

39:41.867 --> 39:43.485
And she's not you.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.704
I know that.

39:45.706 --> 39:47.689
Hey.

39:47.691 --> 39:49.857
I live in the house
I grew up in.

39:49.859 --> 39:51.826
I got the same job my dad did,

39:51.828 --> 39:55.363
my sons have the jobs
I had when I was their age.

39:55.365 --> 39:58.883
And I wouldn't have it
any other way, so...

39:58.885 --> 40:00.535
But you're not me, either.

40:02.054 --> 40:04.456
You know how I know
it's the right way to go?

40:04.458 --> 40:07.642
How, sweetheart?
Because when I really think about it,

40:07.644 --> 40:10.595
I feel excited, but also
kind of like throwing up.

40:11.314 --> 40:12.631
Good answer.
Yeah,

40:12.633 --> 40:14.899
sounds about
right to me.

40:15.685 --> 40:17.402
Smart kid you got there.

40:39.425 --> 40:40.892
What?

40:40.894 --> 40:43.211
I lost a son, too.

40:43.213 --> 40:44.946
I know that.

40:44.948 --> 40:48.049
At the hands
of some corrupt cops,

40:48.051 --> 40:50.885
which you wouldn't know.

40:50.887 --> 40:54.088
And if anyone ever came

40:54.090 --> 40:56.057
and asked for my support

40:56.059 --> 40:58.693
in giving amnesty to dirty cops,

40:58.695 --> 41:00.928
I don't know what I'd do.

41:02.531 --> 41:05.233
I sure as hell wouldn't buy in.

41:06.869 --> 41:09.070
I'm not sure why
you're telling me this.

41:09.072 --> 41:10.739
I know that...

41:10.741 --> 41:12.907
your son's death

41:12.909 --> 41:16.161
wasn't just about
a single car accident.

41:19.615 --> 41:21.616
I can step back now, in case

41:21.618 --> 41:23.802
you want to slam the door
in my face.

41:30.292 --> 41:32.677
He'd quit his tenth
or eleventh rehab

41:32.679 --> 41:34.479
and scored some heroin.

41:36.515 --> 41:38.466
He got it into his head

41:38.468 --> 41:40.318
that it'd be a good idea
to shoot up

41:40.320 --> 41:41.519
and drive to Boston

41:41.521 --> 41:44.656
and try to make up
with his girlfriend.

41:47.359 --> 41:50.829
I said a couple of things
I now regret.

41:52.615 --> 41:55.149
I went through hell and back.

41:55.151 --> 41:57.118
Well... just hell.

41:57.120 --> 41:59.421
There was no coming back.

41:59.423 --> 42:01.155
So...

42:01.157 --> 42:05.009
I've got nothing
for junkies and their problems.

42:06.545 --> 42:07.962
Nothing.

42:07.964 --> 42:09.798
I understand.

42:15.604 --> 42:17.639
It's a red Burgundy.

42:17.641 --> 42:19.674
All I've ever
seen you order is gin,

42:19.676 --> 42:22.310
but somehow a bottle of gin
didn't seem right.

42:22.312 --> 42:23.978
(quick laugh)

42:28.183 --> 42:29.367
Is it any good?

42:29.369 --> 42:31.202
Oh, yeah.

42:35.624 --> 42:38.493
I've got 1,000 bucks on the
Saints and they're down by ten.

42:38.495 --> 42:40.245
You want to come in,
have some wine,

42:40.247 --> 42:42.664
and be in my rooting
section for a bit?

42:43.499 --> 42:45.216
Uh...

42:45.218 --> 42:47.001
Never mind.

42:47.003 --> 42:48.002
Thank you, Frank.

42:48.004 --> 42:49.354
I appreciate the gesture.
Oh,

42:49.356 --> 42:50.755
cut it out.

42:50.757 --> 42:51.840
What quarter?

42:51.842 --> 42:54.208
End of the third.

42:54.210 --> 42:57.495
I just always try to give my
detail some kind of time frame.

42:57.497 --> 42:59.597
Oh.

43:00.432 --> 43:02.383
One hour.
