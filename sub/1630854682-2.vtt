WEBVTT

00:00.075 --> 00:03.504
My sister, my queen, my BFF!

00:03.504 --> 00:06.075
Get a real job.
Defund the police!

00:06.075 --> 00:07.504
Hey!

00:08.273 --> 00:09.636
A lot has happened
in eight months,

00:09.636 --> 00:11.702
you’re back with Steve,
got a new friend.

00:11.702 --> 00:14.075
I’m making partner on Friday.
- Here we go, there it is.

00:14.075 --> 00:17.405
You’ve been playing me
for eight months.

00:22.306 --> 00:24.603
Can you keep Brixton?
- Me?

00:24.603 --> 00:26.240
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:26.240 --> 00:30.240
I have been mandated to invite
you back into the OCE.

00:42.735 --> 00:45.141
Finally, you are going
to sleep, uh?

00:46.603 --> 00:49.141
I don’t know how your mom does
it, I got to hand it to her,

00:49.141 --> 00:51.240
but don’t ever tell I said
anything else.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.207
I’ll never hear the end of it.

00:54.207 --> 00:57.141
- The end of what?
- Oh, Ella. Uh... nothing.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.669
Nothing at all.

00:58.669 --> 01:00.867
Um... There’s his bag,

01:00.867 --> 01:03.537
his breakfast is in there,
which he did not eat.

01:03.537 --> 01:05.273
He hasn’t eaten yet?

01:05.273 --> 01:07.372
How’d he sleep?

01:07.372 --> 01:08.537
Uh...

01:09.207 --> 01:12.240
Not really that well,
neither did I.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.504
As a matter of fact, we both
were up till about 4 AM.

01:14.504 --> 01:17.834
Okay, wow, it’s almost 9.
We’re already late,

01:17.834 --> 01:19.471
I’m meeting another nanny
in the park.

01:19.471 --> 01:21.504
Oh, okay.
Yeah, see you later.

01:21.504 --> 01:22.603
Thank you.

01:22.603 --> 01:24.273
Bye, Brixie!

01:29.735 --> 01:31.735
Yo, Duff! Wait up.

01:31.735 --> 01:33.603
I’m late enough as it is.

01:33.603 --> 01:36.570
Getting the baby ready was
practically impossible.

01:37.273 --> 01:39.141
You know who’s keeping me
up at night? Steve.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.240
He’s got depression insomnia,
he just wanders around the house

01:41.240 --> 01:43.306
all night ever since he lost
his promotion to Ro.

01:43.306 --> 01:44.834
- Who’s Ro?
- She’s like a friend of mine,

01:44.834 --> 01:47.306
she’s really great.
I’m actually in a 10K challenge

01:47.306 --> 01:49.372
with her right now,
I’m already 3000 steps in,

01:49.372 --> 01:50.702
so I’m off to like
a really strong start.

01:50.702 --> 01:52.273
Uh... excuse me?

01:53.141 --> 01:54.900
Wazowski, we’re not supposed
to use the OCE entrance,

01:54.900 --> 01:56.438
and why are you in your civvies?

01:56.438 --> 01:58.702
Oh, right, yeah, so I got
pulled back into OCE.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.438
As a detective?

02:00.768 --> 02:02.768
Uh... yeah, Guns and Gangs
with Duff here.

02:02.768 --> 02:04.570
I meant... I meant
to tell you or call you.

02:04.570 --> 02:06.207
Sure. Wow.
Won’t they be lucky.

02:06.207 --> 02:07.372
After eight months
riding with me,

02:07.372 --> 02:08.504
you picked up a lot
of knowledge.

02:08.504 --> 02:09.636
You know what?

02:09.636 --> 02:11.537
Um... we’re
gonna see you later, okay?

02:11.537 --> 02:13.438
Yeah, yeah, but like,
when later? Do you want to,

02:13.438 --> 02:16.438
like, put something on
the books, or... play it by ear?

02:17.372 --> 02:19.801
Go with me here,
what if we start a club?

02:20.636 --> 02:23.240
Cuff chicks, badge bitches,

02:23.240 --> 02:24.801
babes who bust...

02:25.405 --> 02:28.504
Badges with vages,
vages with badges,

02:28.504 --> 02:30.504
oh, that actually would be
probably a bit better,

02:30.504 --> 02:32.438
something where we can,
like, you know,

02:32.438 --> 02:33.669
all get together
as women detectives.

02:33.669 --> 02:36.438
Um... it’s just that...

02:36.438 --> 02:38.240
You talk like a detective...

02:38.240 --> 02:39.669
We’ll talk about it later.

02:39.669 --> 02:41.603
Yeah, just let it mull around
in your brains

02:41.603 --> 02:43.438
and we can get together
anytime you want.

02:43.438 --> 02:45.273
I’m usually free, I got lots
open in the calendar,

02:45.273 --> 02:47.438
so if you want to give me
a call to go for sushi.

02:48.603 --> 02:53.339
Tell me this, how did you deal
with her for eight months?

02:53.339 --> 02:56.504
I don’t know, I think I was in
some sort of like fugue state.

02:56.504 --> 02:59.504
I just... I am so happy to be
back, like, familiar places,

02:59.504 --> 03:02.900
familiar faces. Why are these
cupboards all rearranged?

03:02.900 --> 03:05.372
Where are all the good snacks?
I swear to God,

03:05.372 --> 03:07.306
every time I come back in here,
the old battle-axe,

03:07.306 --> 03:08.900
she has like flipped
things around.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.669
Good morning, Wazowski.

03:13.636 --> 03:15.570
Good morning.
Hello, commander.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.834
I just thought
you were Duff and that...

03:16.834 --> 03:17.867
Oh.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.471
Yeah. Wow!

03:19.471 --> 03:22.603
Your hair, it looks
really nice with the...

03:22.603 --> 03:26.240
Oh, yeah, my... my niece
did it, I hate it.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.834
I’d prefer you not draw
attention to it.

03:27.834 --> 03:30.636
- Sorry, I’ll just...
- Here’s your badge, detective.

03:30.636 --> 03:32.999
- Thank you.
- Don’t thank me, thank Shanks.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.504
Oh...

03:47.405 --> 03:48.504
Morning.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.603
Morning. How was your night?

03:51.603 --> 03:53.339
Oh, it was good.

03:54.999 --> 03:56.372
How’s Brix?

03:56.999 --> 03:58.306
He’s great.

03:58.768 --> 04:00.108
Do you wanna
come over tonight?

04:01.240 --> 04:02.867
You know I love me some baby,
I’ll make you some dinner...

04:02.867 --> 04:04.471
You know what?
Let me think about that.

04:04.471 --> 04:07.900
- Look what I got!
- Oh! Look who it is!

04:07.900 --> 04:09.471
That looks good on you, Wazowski.

04:09.471 --> 04:11.405
Thanks. I am so excited
to be back.

04:11.405 --> 04:14.471
Okay. Yeah, what do we got?
A drug bust? Trafficking ring?

04:14.471 --> 04:17.999
Yes. This is Tim Nadon,
he goes by Switch.

04:17.999 --> 04:20.636
Yeah. We think he sold
some drugs to this woman

04:20.636 --> 04:23.702
who OD’d in a club
last week and died.

04:23.702 --> 04:25.471
Yeah, he’s known
for dealing cocaine,

04:25.471 --> 04:27.867
but the medical examiner
said this was not that,

04:27.867 --> 04:29.834
so we need to figure out
what he is selling.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.702
So, we need to use a UC

04:31.702 --> 04:33.735
as bait and bust him
when he sells again.

04:33.735 --> 04:35.801
We’d love to, except
we’ve been following him

04:35.801 --> 04:37.966
all week and he hasn’t made
a single sale.

04:38.504 --> 04:40.834
The guy barely leaves the house.

04:40.834 --> 04:43.933
Yeah. So, we need to get
inside and plant one of these.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.372
Any idea how?

04:45.801 --> 04:47.471
Well, his mother
just passed away

04:47.471 --> 04:49.834
and by the sounds
of the obituary, I don’t know,

04:49.834 --> 04:51.339
she seems pretty religious.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.405
Okay, just let me do

05:02.405 --> 05:03.900
all the talking.
- Why?

05:03.900 --> 05:05.966
Do I not look pious enough?
- What do you know about Jesus?

05:05.966 --> 05:07.735
Uh... he’s Jewish,
he’s not white

05:07.735 --> 05:09.999
and he’s probably afraid
of nails. Joking, that’s...

05:10.933 --> 05:13.702
- Hello?
- Hello! God bless you.

05:13.702 --> 05:16.537
My name is Kelly, this is
my partner in worship, Sam,

05:16.537 --> 05:19.966
we’re here from St. Hunna’s,
and your name is?

05:19.966 --> 05:21.999
I go by Switch.
- Switch.

05:21.999 --> 05:24.471
How fortuitous because
we were hoping that you would

05:24.471 --> 05:26.900
switch to our church.
I’m just kidding.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.636
I’m kidding, but did you see

05:28.636 --> 05:30.570
what I did there with your name?
It’s like, "Switch." And then...

05:30.570 --> 05:32.834
<i>The good Lord has obviously
given her a sense of humour.</i>

05:32.834 --> 05:33.966
<i>Amen!</i>

05:33.966 --> 05:35.603
Get in, plant the devices,

05:35.603 --> 05:36.867
we’ll let you
know when they’re engaged.

05:36.867 --> 05:38.768
But we really just wanted
to let you know

05:38.768 --> 05:40.867
what we’re all about, can we
just come in for a quick chat?

05:40.867 --> 05:42.537
No, sorry.

05:42.537 --> 05:44.504
Oh, that’s a shame because
when we visited a while back,

05:44.504 --> 05:46.933
we spoke to Meredith
and she just seemed really keen

05:46.933 --> 05:48.735
to continue our conversation.
- Did she?

05:48.735 --> 05:49.900
She did.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.570
- Just come in.
- We’re gonna come.

05:51.570 --> 05:53.075
Oh, my gosh, your house
is lovely. Did you decorate?

05:53.075 --> 05:54.768
The good Lord
is blessing you.

05:54.768 --> 05:56.867
<i>No, this was
my mother’s house.</i>

05:56.867 --> 05:58.537
<i>Meredith, the woman
you met...</i>

05:58.537 --> 06:00.141
Uh, she passed away
about six months ago.

06:00.141 --> 06:01.867
Oh, I’m so sorry.

06:01.867 --> 06:04.933
There is a verse
that I draw from when
I’m feeling really down,

06:04.933 --> 06:07.570
"Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

06:07.570 --> 06:11.603
I shall fear no evil!"
Um! Psalm 23:4.

06:11.603 --> 06:15.999
- I thought that was Coolio.
- True also... What a cool song.

06:15.999 --> 06:19.603
But if you really love music,
our church has it all.

06:19.603 --> 06:21.636
Our music can be heard...

06:21.636 --> 06:24.702
On high, yeah!

06:24.702 --> 06:25.999
If you know what I mean.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.438
Let me tell you
all about it now.

06:27.438 --> 06:29.108
You know, I would love to--

06:29.108 --> 06:31.471
I actually also sing
in the choir, one of three
Mezzo-Sopranos,

06:31.471 --> 06:33.867
we call ourselves Mezzos
for the Messiah.

06:33.867 --> 06:35.768
Could I just use your
washroom really quickly?

06:35.768 --> 06:37.438
- I--
- I gotta go! It’s happening...

06:37.438 --> 06:38.900
I can’t let you back there.
- Really?

06:38.900 --> 06:40.735
It sure is happening,
I’m peeing through my skirt.

06:40.735 --> 06:42.042
Okay, okay, it’s that way.

06:42.042 --> 06:43.669
Just... just hurry up.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.537
She has a really weak bladder.
What is this?

06:47.075 --> 06:49.537
- It’s right here?
- Oh, my goodness!

06:49.537 --> 06:51.570
Oh darn, did I do that?

06:51.570 --> 06:53.042
Oh, boy, can I help
you pick those up?

06:53.042 --> 06:54.174
It’s okay, I got it.

06:54.174 --> 06:55.174
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

06:55.174 --> 06:57.636
I am so sorry, I’m so sorry.

06:57.636 --> 06:59.669
Oh! Your mom would be
so proud of you.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.471
You led us into her home,
now your home,

07:02.471 --> 07:04.603
and next step
is to let the Lord,

07:04.603 --> 07:06.735
the Lord, into your heart,

07:06.735 --> 07:09.537
because the holy spirit
is filling this room!

07:09.537 --> 07:13.207
Hallelujah! Can you feel it?

07:13.207 --> 07:16.042
Hey guys,
I think I found the spot.

07:16.042 --> 07:17.933
Your friend is taking a while.

07:17.933 --> 07:20.075
But you know, sometimes,
those number ones,

07:20.075 --> 07:22.900
they just turn into number twos.
- Oh.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.933
Oh, hello. Um...

07:32.933 --> 07:34.669
You must be a friend
of Switch’s.

07:34.669 --> 07:36.966
Your hair looks nice,
my name is Sam,

07:36.966 --> 07:38.108
it’s really nice
to meet you.

07:39.801 --> 07:41.834
Oh, hi. What sort of drugs
are you on?

07:41.834 --> 07:43.240
Maybe I could help you,
is that something you...

07:43.240 --> 07:45.735
What’s that?

07:45.735 --> 07:47.273
Sam? Sam, are you okay?

07:47.273 --> 07:49.504
I actually have friends
visiting, but...

07:49.504 --> 07:51.570
Sweet baby Jesus!

07:51.570 --> 07:53.141
Someone else
is in there with her.

07:53.141 --> 07:54.933
Oh my God!

07:54.933 --> 07:56.042
Get off of me!

07:56.042 --> 07:57.042
<i>Sam? Are you okay?</i>

07:57.042 --> 07:58.108
Oh, well,

07:58.108 --> 07:59.768
maybe we should
just go check.

08:01.207 --> 08:03.834
Sam! Get off! Look out!
<i>- Guys, is everything all right</i>

08:03.834 --> 08:05.702
Don’t get into my stuff!
Okay, everyone out!

08:05.702 --> 08:08.141
Get off of her!
I’m calling the cops!

08:08.141 --> 08:10.306
No, no cops!

08:10.306 --> 08:12.768
<i>Give us a sign
if you need backup.</i>

08:14.999 --> 08:16.603
<i>Should we come in?</i>

08:16.603 --> 08:18.174
Sam, come on, we gotta
get out of here.

08:18.174 --> 08:19.768
<i>- Come on, Sam.</i>
- Two seconds!

08:19.768 --> 08:22.042
- Ah!
- Hey! Give me those back, lady!

08:22.570 --> 08:23.735
Device is in place!

08:24.570 --> 08:25.834
Okay, we got it.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.570
Come on, Sam!
- I’m coming!

08:37.570 --> 08:39.867
Ugh... What the hell
were those people on?

08:39.867 --> 08:43.141
Well, the test kit works
and the drug seems to be

08:43.141 --> 08:46.042
some sort of cathinone.
- What, like bath salts?

08:46.042 --> 08:48.636
Weirder, and actually,
some of the same chemicals

08:48.636 --> 08:50.240
were in the deceased’s
toxicology report.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.339
So, we have a new drug
on the street.

08:52.339 --> 08:54.801
Yeah, looks like it.

08:54.801 --> 08:58.306
But we can’t just arrest Switch
for an empty bag of whatever,

08:58.306 --> 08:59.867
we have to prove
that he’s selling it.

08:59.867 --> 09:03.240
Any lawyer worth their salt...
no pun intended.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.075
Hey!

09:05.075 --> 09:07.900
...could say that those two
brought that stuff

09:07.900 --> 09:09.273
into Switch’s house themselves.

09:09.273 --> 09:12.603
Okay, so we listen in,
intercept his next deal,

09:12.603 --> 09:14.273
get him in here, figure out
where he’s getting it from

09:14.273 --> 09:15.801
before it kills
somebody else.

09:15.801 --> 09:17.108
Wazowski, Duff.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.339
Follow me.

09:20.075 --> 09:21.933
I’ve got a case
for you two.

09:22.768 --> 09:25.075
Someone’s been stealing liquid
ketamine from the vet clinic

09:25.075 --> 09:28.669
at Metro Animal Sanctuary
and no one can figure out
how it’s getting out.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.372
This case has been sitting
on my desk for six months,

09:31.372 --> 09:35.273
collecting dust, unsolved,
and I just got a call that
it’s happened again,

09:35.273 --> 09:39.372
20 vials, this time. You need to
call the director, Martin Baker.

09:39.372 --> 09:42.075
Oh, Commander Ballard,
no... disrespect,

09:42.075 --> 09:45.141
but we are actually working
on a really big drug bust.

09:45.141 --> 09:48.702
Uh-uh, uh-uh, bigger
than medical-grade ketamine
falling onto the streets?

09:48.702 --> 09:51.702
Well, does bath-salty-killer
meth-cocaine on-crack

09:51.702 --> 09:53.933
sound small to you?
- Hey, listen, I have an idea.

09:53.933 --> 09:55.405
Maybe Watts and Chase
could do it?

09:55.405 --> 09:57.405
- Oh.
- They’ve tried and failed.

09:57.405 --> 10:01.042
Hey, I need fresh eyes, right?

10:01.042 --> 10:05.735
Do you know how often
liquid ketamine is used
in instances of date rape?

10:05.735 --> 10:07.306
You know what
date rape is, right?

10:07.306 --> 10:09.900
Do you know how many date rapes
could be facilitated

10:09.900 --> 10:12.339
by somebody who has 20 vials
of liquid ketamine?

10:12.339 --> 10:15.735
Date rape sounds kind
of victim-blamey, right?

10:15.735 --> 10:17.735
Maybe we could just say
sexual assault?

10:17.735 --> 10:19.933
Why don’t you just say, "Yes,
Commander, I’ll look into it."

10:19.933 --> 10:22.768
Um? How about that, right? See?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.141
This why I like to pick
my own team.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.801
You know, Shanks forced me to
take you both back because...

10:29.801 --> 10:32.075
Well, she thinks
you walk on water, but...

10:32.075 --> 10:34.966
me, I’m not so sure. You have
just gotten back from...

10:34.966 --> 10:36.867
what, eight months undercover?

10:36.867 --> 10:39.438
So, God knows what
your mental state is.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.735
My mental state is fine,
thank you.

10:44.273 --> 10:48.207
And... So, just to be clear,
I wasn’t undercover.

10:48.207 --> 10:50.438
No, you were demoted,
so forgive me for not being

10:50.438 --> 10:52.768
convinced of your merits,
but hey, solve the case,

10:52.768 --> 10:55.801
prove me wrong,
prove yourselves. Until then,

10:55.801 --> 10:57.933
neither of you are
part of the A team.

11:05.405 --> 11:07.999
Chase, what do you know
about this animal sanctuary?

11:09.339 --> 11:12.174
The animal sanctuary? Again?

11:12.174 --> 11:13.999
Good luck with that.

11:13.999 --> 11:17.273
You two better clear
your schedules for the rest
of the year.

11:19.768 --> 11:22.339
Okay, so you two have nothing
to add to this shoddy report?

11:22.339 --> 11:24.042
You have no information,
any suspects,

11:24.042 --> 11:25.372
no idea who is stealing
the ketamine?

11:25.372 --> 11:27.306
No one was ever seen
sneaking anything

11:27.306 --> 11:28.801
in or out of the locker room

11:28.801 --> 11:30.207
where the pharmaceuticals
are stored.

11:30.207 --> 11:32.933
Yeah. And it stopped
happening, so... case closed.

11:32.933 --> 11:34.900
- Case closed.
- Case closed.

11:34.900 --> 11:37.306
Or it stopped happening
because the police kept
interviewing everyone?

11:37.306 --> 11:39.966
If we couldn’t solve it, you
two are never gonna solve it.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.471
Never.
- Okay?

11:41.471 --> 11:44.273
It’s almost like someone was
just... stealing in plain sight.

11:44.273 --> 11:46.273
Plain sight.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.999
I mean, it is like someone
is stealing in plain sight!

11:49.999 --> 11:51.966
It’s all my fault.

11:52.405 --> 11:55.273
I tried moving the vials
to my office, but...

11:56.339 --> 11:59.042
People need the ketamine
so often in the clinic

11:59.042 --> 12:01.867
that it became a total
boondoggle signing it out.

12:01.867 --> 12:04.273
I should have kept
better track of it.

12:04.273 --> 12:07.405
But do you know how hard it is
to be a single parent

12:07.405 --> 12:09.933
of five and run
an animal sanctuary?

12:10.768 --> 12:13.240
That’s like managing
two sanctuaries.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.504
I mean, I’m taking care
of one kid and I got--

12:15.504 --> 12:17.273
I try to be a good boss!

12:17.273 --> 12:23.141
I throw holiday parties,
I give the staff bonuses, but...

12:23.141 --> 12:28.471
Well, what do I get? Some
jackass stealing tranquilizers!

12:29.108 --> 12:30.339
Uh...

12:31.372 --> 12:35.042
Uh, anyway, I want to help,
but I have to pick up

12:35.042 --> 12:36.933
one kid in 20 and then,

12:36.933 --> 12:38.933
take another to Jiu-Jitsu
right after.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.570
Mr. Baker, can you get us
into your veterinary centre

12:40.570 --> 12:43.075
undercover before the next batch
of ketamine is delivered?

12:43.075 --> 12:45.405
I mean, it’s just really
the best way for us to suss out

12:45.405 --> 12:47.339
who’s doing it without giving
the perpetrator a heads up.

12:47.339 --> 12:50.372
Sure, but the next shipment’s
on Thursday,

12:50.372 --> 12:52.537
so you don’t have
very much time.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.867
You know, maybe you can help
speed up the process.

12:55.867 --> 12:58.042
Tell me, who else has access
to the drugs?

12:58.042 --> 13:01.306
Uh... well,
there’s only three people

13:01.306 --> 13:03.999
who have keycard access
to the treatment room.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.108
Oh!

13:07.801 --> 13:09.834
All right, give it to me.

13:09.834 --> 13:12.240
Okay, so first up
is Riley Salgado, she’s 26,

13:12.240 --> 13:14.504
she’s a veterinary technician.
According to logs, she swipes

13:14.504 --> 13:16.471
in and out with one of these
several times a day,

13:16.471 --> 13:18.999
but she doesn’t have
a keycard to the drug room.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.471
I looked at her ViewPix and
besides being a radical vegan

13:21.471 --> 13:23.504
and a huge animal lover,
she seems to be a DJ.

13:23.504 --> 13:25.438
House, EDM, techno.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.339
Ooh, so do you think
that she’s stealing the K
to sell at parties?

13:28.339 --> 13:33.042
Maybe, or it could be
Marla Van Beeks.

13:33.042 --> 13:34.570
She’s 40 and is a bird handler.

13:34.570 --> 13:37.141
Now, according to Martin,
one of her birds is on a strict

13:37.141 --> 13:38.834
regimen of antidepressants.

13:38.834 --> 13:41.306
She’s been given a keycard to
retrieve its medication daily.

13:41.306 --> 13:43.471
Oh, look at this!
Okay, Marla’s recently separated

13:43.471 --> 13:45.933
and she’s paying
a ton of support to her
unemployed ex-husband,

13:45.933 --> 13:48.240
so do you think that
she is stealing the drugs
to pay for alimony?

13:48.240 --> 13:51.504
Oh, I don’t know.
It could be this guy.

13:51.504 --> 13:53.999
Carl Massoud, head veterinarian.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.240
Now, he did a stint in rehab
for alcoholism

13:56.240 --> 13:58.933
and he was arrested for fraud
charges and he was cleared,

13:58.933 --> 14:01.207
but it still could be
a red flag.

14:03.075 --> 14:06.207
Now, speaking of red flags.
- Mm?

14:06.207 --> 14:09.108
What do you think about what
Ballard said to me today?

14:09.867 --> 14:11.504
About me coming back to OCE?

14:11.504 --> 14:12.933
Um...

14:13.603 --> 14:15.471
Could you just remind me again?

14:15.471 --> 14:17.471
How I might not be ready
to come back to work?

14:17.471 --> 14:19.240
I mean, it’s ridiculous, right?

14:19.240 --> 14:21.372
How many times
have I gone undercover?

14:21.372 --> 14:24.405
Dozens, and I’m all right.
My mental state is fine, right?

14:24.405 --> 14:26.372
Oh my God, oh my God!
No, wait. Oh...

14:26.372 --> 14:28.603
Okay, so the lawyer that got
Carl off, that’s my friend, Ro!

14:28.603 --> 14:31.636
That’s my friend! Okay, so we
can go and ask her about him.

14:31.636 --> 14:33.471
Ever heard of attorney-client
privilege?

14:33.471 --> 14:35.405
Ever hear of
a character witness?

14:35.405 --> 14:37.339
Come on, you should
meet her anyway.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.339
Just so you know, I got 3000
steps in before work.

14:45.339 --> 14:47.141
I did a 5K this morning,

14:47.141 --> 14:49.966
then a cooldown walk
on my treadmill before
my morning smoothie.

14:49.966 --> 14:51.504
Oh, well, it’s game on
for you.

14:51.504 --> 14:53.273
Oh, and my exercise ring
has closed for the day.

14:53.273 --> 14:55.141
What?

14:55.141 --> 14:57.405
Can we talk about Carl
before my patience ring
closes for eternity?

14:57.405 --> 15:00.768
Oh, sorry, Kel, you must think
we’re so annoying.

15:00.768 --> 15:02.669
It’s actually Kelly, and no,

15:02.669 --> 15:05.108
but we are on a bit
of a time crunch, Ro.

15:05.108 --> 15:07.702
Yes, um... okay, so what can
you tell us about Carl?

15:07.702 --> 15:09.933
That guy definitely has

15:09.933 --> 15:12.339
an anger problem
and he’s fallen off the wagon

15:12.339 --> 15:13.933
more times than he’s been on it,

15:13.933 --> 15:15.471
but he was completely
innocent of fraud.

15:15.471 --> 15:17.603
Ah! Says every defence
attorney ever.

15:17.603 --> 15:21.438
He got mixed up
in his cousin’s insider
investment scheme.

15:21.438 --> 15:23.438
He had zero clue
what he was investing in.

15:23.438 --> 15:25.075
When the cousin fessed up,

15:25.075 --> 15:26.504
charges against Carl
were dropped.

15:26.504 --> 15:29.075
Okay, so do you think
he’s capable of like stealing

15:29.075 --> 15:31.141
and, like, selling drugs?
- Um... My gut says no,

15:31.141 --> 15:34.438
he’s a decent guy, loves his
job. Who else you got for it?

15:34.438 --> 15:37.141
Sorry, we can’t discuss
an active investigation.

15:37.141 --> 15:38.702
You know?
- What?

15:38.702 --> 15:41.504
He always complained about
this woman that he worked with.

15:41.504 --> 15:42.735
- Who?
- Marla.

15:42.735 --> 15:44.075
Marla!
- Yes!

15:44.075 --> 15:46.108
- Bird handler.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

15:46.108 --> 15:49.042
It’s a messy divorce, paying
spousal support to her ex.

15:49.042 --> 15:51.306
How long were they married for?
- Six years, he got the house.

15:51.306 --> 15:54.438
Um. Let me guess, he built
some bookshelves?

15:54.438 --> 15:58.042
Contributions to the property.
I hate this... business, it’s...

15:58.042 --> 16:00.537
Right? Yeah. Now, she’s on
the hook for 1000 bucks a month.

16:00.537 --> 16:01.768
How is she paying her rent?

16:05.867 --> 16:07.471
What do you think, Kel... ly?
- Well, I think that--

16:07.471 --> 16:08.603
Yes!

16:08.603 --> 16:10.207
- What?
- 10,000 steps, done.

16:10.207 --> 16:13.207
Are you serious? Don’t gloat,
it’s only mid-afternoon!

16:13.207 --> 16:15.405
Okay, you know what? Come on.
You can get your steps in

16:15.405 --> 16:18.075
tomorrow at the sanctuary.
- You’ll get it next time!

16:18.075 --> 16:19.603
I will, you wait and see!

16:19.603 --> 16:21.471
Bye, Ro!
- Bye!

16:25.570 --> 16:27.273
<i>Copy that, Raider One.</i>

16:27.273 --> 16:30.141
<i>Do you want to attack
as a team or go rogue?</i>

16:32.174 --> 16:35.702
Is this really what
this guy does all day?

16:35.702 --> 16:38.240
I’m starting to see
why he was so happy to listen

16:38.240 --> 16:39.537
to Kelly talk about church.

16:39.537 --> 16:41.636
And I’m starting
to crave cheesy puffs.

16:41.636 --> 16:45.108
What is happening?

16:47.636 --> 16:51.075
<i>BostonPickle,
this is Switch89.</i>

16:51.504 --> 16:53.669
<i>I sent you
an invitation to my bunker.</i>

16:55.108 --> 16:57.042
<i>Restocking the sandbags.</i>

16:57.042 --> 16:59.042
Somebody’s playing
a joke on us.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.075
Morning, ladies.

17:07.075 --> 17:10.174
Oh, here, identification badges.

17:12.702 --> 17:15.240
Welcome to the Metro Sanctuary.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.801
You’re ready?
- Yeah, let’s get ’er done.

17:17.801 --> 17:19.075
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:19.075 --> 17:19.504
- After you.
- Oh, sorry...

17:23.504 --> 17:27.702
This is where all the magic
happens, this is where

17:27.702 --> 17:31.768
our dedicated veterinary staff
take care of all of our animals.

17:31.768 --> 17:34.768
Riley, these are
our new trainees.

17:34.768 --> 17:37.207
This is Sam and Kelly.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.207
Could you show them around?

17:41.207 --> 17:43.438
I have to go to
a parent-teacher meeting

17:43.438 --> 17:47.603
because my youngest started a
Ponzi scheme on the playground.

17:52.471 --> 17:55.504
Is he always that stressed?
- Everyone is.

17:55.504 --> 17:57.867
We’re understaffed and I need
to focus on these guys.

17:57.867 --> 18:00.372
Oh, my gosh! How old are they?

18:00.372 --> 18:02.570
They just hatched.
- So cute!

18:02.570 --> 18:04.207
And tiny.

18:04.207 --> 18:07.405
Riley, stop crowding the
turtles, it’s not a petting zoo.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.867
You must be the new trainees?
I’m Doctor Carl Massoud.

18:10.867 --> 18:15.339
Why don’t you...
go and help Marla in the aviary?

18:15.339 --> 18:17.339
I need some quiet.

18:21.471 --> 18:22.735
Is this decaf?

18:23.504 --> 18:25.537
How I am supposed to get
work done with decaf?

18:25.537 --> 18:26.801
Sorry.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.405
Why don’t you just
follow Riley?

18:30.405 --> 18:32.570
She’ll introduce you to Marla.

18:33.372 --> 18:34.867
Okay.

18:42.735 --> 18:45.372
Yeah, and we need to keep
this area very clean

18:45.372 --> 18:48.537
because it’s where we do all the
prep for the bird food and...

18:48.537 --> 18:49.735
Oh!

18:50.735 --> 18:52.735
Time for your medication, Pearl.
- Oh, is she sick?

18:52.735 --> 18:56.240
Pearl has anxiety. She’s going
through a bird divorce of sorts.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.240
A bird divorce?

18:58.240 --> 19:01.570
Good girl. Yeah, not all birds
mate for life.

19:01.570 --> 19:03.768
Turns out Pearl’s partner
thought she was too much

19:03.768 --> 19:05.636
to handle and found someone new.

19:05.636 --> 19:07.504
Well, it looks like
she’s doing okay now.

19:07.504 --> 19:09.240
Yeah, she’s doing okay.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.240
You should have seen her
a couple of weeks ago,

19:11.240 --> 19:15.240
she was moulting and hiding
everywhere, she was a real mess,

19:15.240 --> 19:17.273
so we started her on SSRIs

19:17.273 --> 19:19.702
and that made a world
of difference, didn’t it?

19:19.702 --> 19:21.801
Well, that and love, attention,

19:21.801 --> 19:25.207
exercise... Right, Pearl?
There you go.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.735
Exercise, right? Fetch!

19:27.933 --> 19:30.669
Good girl!
- Wow!

19:30.669 --> 19:32.537
We’ve really bonded.

19:32.537 --> 19:36.669
We’ve had so many chats over
getting out of bad marriages.

19:36.669 --> 19:38.273
Good girl.

19:39.636 --> 19:43.240
Uh... well,
here’s hoping she gets back
on the dating scene soon.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.273
Yeah, she will, she will.

19:45.273 --> 19:46.834
Fetch!

19:46.834 --> 19:48.570
Good girl!

19:48.570 --> 19:52.372
Hey! I’m gonna grab a coffee,
anyone want one?

19:52.372 --> 19:54.603
Thank you, honey,
you’re the best.

19:54.603 --> 19:55.834
Riley?

19:55.834 --> 19:57.372
On second thought,
I’ve got to run.

19:57.372 --> 19:59.702
You know what,
can I come with you?

19:59.702 --> 20:01.537
- Sure.
- Yeah, I’ll just stay here

20:01.537 --> 20:02.768
with Marla.
- And Pearl.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.273
And Pearl.
- Yeah.

20:04.273 --> 20:06.471
- Lovely to meet you.
- Can’t forget Pearl.

20:06.471 --> 20:07.735
There you go, buddy.

20:07.735 --> 20:09.768
Get that ball, pretend that’s
a man, grab it!

20:09.768 --> 20:11.834
- Yes!
- That’s a good girl!

20:11.834 --> 20:13.933
Can I help with anything?
- Uh... no.

20:13.933 --> 20:15.867
Riley and I are just about
to lance an abscess

20:15.867 --> 20:18.834
and you’re gonna find it super
disgusting... because it is,

20:18.834 --> 20:20.768
unless you’re one of those
people who likes watching

20:20.768 --> 20:22.603
pimple popper videos
on the internet?

20:22.603 --> 20:25.438
Ah... no, that’s a hard no.
- Right.

20:25.438 --> 20:29.273
So, just avert your eyes or take
a long five, we just sedated.

20:29.273 --> 20:30.933
I’ll put the ketamine away.
- No, I’ll do that.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.570
Oh, you know,
I can help with that.

20:32.570 --> 20:33.603
I’m good.

20:46.768 --> 20:49.933
Okay, I have got some serious
intel out of Marla.

20:49.933 --> 20:52.537
It is her, I just feel it...
- No, no, it’s Carl.

20:52.537 --> 20:55.372
He runs that treatment room
like Fort Knox.

20:55.372 --> 20:57.702
He has maximum access...
- Marla has maximum motive.

20:57.702 --> 20:59.537
I’ve just talked to her about
her ex-husband’s new girlfriend,

20:59.537 --> 21:02.339
he got an $8000 engagement
ring which she paid for, so...

21:02.339 --> 21:04.570
Are you serious? This is not
The Real Housewives, Sam.

21:04.570 --> 21:06.075
Yeah, I know it’s not
The Real Housewives,

21:06.075 --> 21:08.504
it’s just that Ro said that
Carl’s a good guy and... What?!

21:08.504 --> 21:09.966
No, we are not...
I’m not gonna let

21:09.966 --> 21:11.999
some defence attorney
give me tunnel vision,

21:11.999 --> 21:13.537
that’s not good policing.

21:13.537 --> 21:15.042
This should be about
what we think.

21:15.042 --> 21:17.306
I see what’s going on here,
you have a problem with Ro.

21:17.306 --> 21:19.537
I don’t have a problem with
Ro, I don’t even know the girl,

21:19.537 --> 21:21.966
but what I have a problem with
is that you’re so keen to listen

21:21.966 --> 21:23.933
to what she has to say
and you’re not listening to me.

21:23.933 --> 21:25.636
Okay, you’re being
very petty right now,

21:25.636 --> 21:27.042
which is also not good policing.

21:28.438 --> 21:30.636
Good policing is forming
a working theory

21:30.636 --> 21:33.471
and following it,
and my money is on Carl.

21:33.471 --> 21:35.768
Great, but my money
is on Marla.

21:35.768 --> 21:38.900
Okay, then.
You look into your theory
and I’ll look into mine.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.570
In the meantime, I need
to get my steps in.

21:50.867 --> 21:53.933
Okay, yum, yum.

21:53.933 --> 21:56.438
Who’s ready for
the yum, yum, huh?

21:56.438 --> 21:58.372
Who’s ready for the yum, yum?

21:58.372 --> 21:59.735
Okay, here we go.

21:59.735 --> 22:04.603
It’s a bird, it’s a plane,
no, it’s carrot mush!

22:04.603 --> 22:05.900
Woo!

22:09.471 --> 22:12.438
Please, please, please, please,
please, go, go, no!

22:13.504 --> 22:14.966
Come on Brixy, please!

22:14.966 --> 22:16.933
Come on, let’s eat this
before Ella gets here,

22:16.933 --> 22:19.042
because if I have to hear her
tell me one more time

22:19.042 --> 22:21.075
about how you eat
for her and not for me,

22:21.075 --> 22:23.636
I’m just gonna cry. Please!

22:23.636 --> 22:25.075
No, please eat it!

22:27.570 --> 22:31.867
Okay, how about... we play
with this, huh?

22:31.867 --> 22:35.999
No, no, no, no! Don’t cry!

22:35.999 --> 22:38.174
No, please!

22:38.174 --> 22:40.471
Please, don’t cry, Brixy,
just eat it!

22:40.471 --> 22:42.405
No, just eat it, please!

22:45.108 --> 22:46.471
Wazowski.

22:47.174 --> 22:48.900
Updates?
- You were hanging out

22:48.900 --> 22:50.735
with your niece last night!
I can tell because, you know,

22:50.735 --> 22:52.141
you just have more red
in your hair,

22:52.141 --> 22:53.669
it looks absolutely fabulous.
The bird woman did it!

22:53.669 --> 22:55.504
No, the vet did it.

22:55.504 --> 22:58.174
Oh, well, this sounds
like a bad game of Clue.

22:58.174 --> 23:00.570
What are you saying?
You have no working theory?

23:00.570 --> 23:01.768
We’re close.
- Mm-hmm.

23:01.768 --> 23:03.702
And there’s more drugs being
delivered today,

23:03.702 --> 23:05.141
then, we’re gonna monitor
it closely, so...

23:05.141 --> 23:08.405
Okay, well, the clock is
ticking, so no time to waste.

23:08.405 --> 23:09.636
Mm-hmm.

23:14.933 --> 23:16.636
Oh, hey, Mary, I’m really glad

23:16.636 --> 23:17.933
that you decided to join
badge bitches

23:17.933 --> 23:19.867
because women need to stick
together, you know?

23:19.867 --> 23:21.141
My name is Susan.

23:21.141 --> 23:23.735
You know, membership
is exclusive and limited,

23:23.735 --> 23:25.669
so anyone who wants to join
better chop-chop.

23:25.669 --> 23:27.966
You know what?
I think you should join.

23:27.966 --> 23:29.900
You could expand
your walking competition.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.570
Well, I will if you will.

23:31.570 --> 23:33.636
I’m not really
into the group thing.

23:33.636 --> 23:36.174
Right, I see,
lone wolf Kelly is back.

23:36.174 --> 23:38.801
Yes, she is.
- Great.

23:38.801 --> 23:40.042
See you later.
- Goodbye.

23:40.042 --> 23:41.438
Mm-hmm.

23:41.438 --> 23:44.174
- Hey, Kelly.
- Hey, Steve. Bye... Steve?

23:45.900 --> 23:47.966
Hey, what are you doing here?

23:47.966 --> 23:49.537
Well, I thought we could
have a coffee.

23:49.537 --> 23:51.537
I’m at work.

23:51.537 --> 23:53.702
I’m at work and you’re
in the same sweatpants
you’ve been wearing for days!

23:53.702 --> 23:55.603
I know,
but I’m not working.

23:55.603 --> 23:57.768
We could just grab a quick one
out front? I need to talk.

23:57.768 --> 24:00.174
Listen, sweetie,
I love you, I do.

24:00.174 --> 24:02.471
I love you, but you got to go.
- But I’m overthinking things

24:02.471 --> 24:05.108
and I need your wisdom.
- Okay, all my wisdom,

24:05.108 --> 24:08.108
all of it’s coming
at you tonight, after work.

24:08.108 --> 24:10.570
Can I get a quick nugget
to chew on for now, at least?

24:10.570 --> 24:11.834
Yeah, you can actually.

24:11.834 --> 24:13.207
He who never showers
never shines.

24:13.207 --> 24:15.240
You’re right, okay,
I’ll shower. Thanks, sweetie.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.834
Okay. Bye.

24:22.537 --> 24:23.834
Cool hair.

24:28.999 --> 24:31.537
Let me ask you this, though,
has this guy spoken

24:31.537 --> 24:34.042
to a real human
in the last 24 hours?

24:34.042 --> 24:37.141
Um... That is a negative.

24:37.141 --> 24:40.702
<i>NiloMega, this is Switch89.</i>

24:41.537 --> 24:43.768
<i>I sent you an invitation
to my bunker.</i>

24:44.867 --> 24:46.240
<i>Restocking the sandbags.</i>

24:46.999 --> 24:48.702
Hang on a second.
- Hmm?

24:48.702 --> 24:50.570
He said something
like that yesterday.

24:51.999 --> 24:54.042
Look up bunker in BattleBender.

24:55.570 --> 24:56.735
Trust me.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.174
A bunker is a place where
you can invite other players

25:05.174 --> 25:06.999
to chat or have
a private game.

25:08.801 --> 25:10.537
I wonder what a sandbag is.

25:13.174 --> 25:16.669
There’s no sandbag tool
or function in BattleBender.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.306
Sandbags, bags of sand!

25:23.306 --> 25:25.768
He’s not messing around all day,

25:25.768 --> 25:29.669
he’s using the video game
to sell drugs!

25:41.966 --> 25:47.570
Hey, Switch89,
looking for sandbags.

25:53.075 --> 25:55.768
<i>Got lots, join my game.</i>

25:57.801 --> 26:00.966
I’m in the waiting room.
- Okay, okay!

26:01.372 --> 26:04.834
<i>Hey, KrazeeFreezie.
This is Switch89.</i>

26:06.339 --> 26:08.273
<i>Sent you an invitation
to my bunker.</i>

26:08.966 --> 26:10.801
<i>Restocking the sandbags.</i>

26:12.240 --> 26:14.141
I’m in.
- Nice!

26:25.372 --> 26:27.900
Hipster haven, what’s that?
What is hipster haven?

26:27.900 --> 26:29.042
Uh...

26:32.735 --> 26:35.405
Balancing act, slack-lining?

26:35.405 --> 26:37.240
Ooh.

26:38.372 --> 26:40.636
You up for a little
Man on Wire action?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.372
Bro, have you met me?

26:57.207 --> 26:58.933
Go-time, drugs are here.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.735
Delivery for Doctor Massoud?
- Yeah, that’s me.

27:16.108 --> 27:19.702
Hey, trainees, why don’t you
help me load this into lock-up?

27:19.702 --> 27:21.141
- Sure.
- Will do.

27:33.900 --> 27:38.108
Amoxicillin, doxycycline, prednisolone.

27:38.108 --> 27:41.339
Fluoxetine. Clomipramine.
All right.

27:41.339 --> 27:44.471
Oh. Happy pills are here
again. Yeah, I’ll take that.

27:46.075 --> 27:47.438
All right, box two.

27:48.174 --> 27:51.372
We got 30 units of lidocaine,

27:51.372 --> 27:55.339
four boxes of ketamine,
spironolactone. Bring it in.

28:00.273 --> 28:02.042
- Box three.
- Yeah, I’ll do this.

28:02.042 --> 28:03.438
Uh... I can just
hand it to you.

28:03.438 --> 28:06.735
- Okay.
- Okay, so we got 12 rolls

28:06.735 --> 28:10.339
of conforming stretch gauze
bandages and 100 syringes.

28:10.339 --> 28:12.405
Let’s do it.
- Yeah, thank you.

28:12.405 --> 28:15.372
We got hydrocolloid dressings,

28:15.372 --> 28:18.504
catheters and snook hooks.

28:18.504 --> 28:20.306
The catheters go on
the bottom shelf.

28:22.966 --> 28:24.966
Okay, thanks.

28:34.141 --> 28:36.141
I’ll follow Marla.
- Yeah, okay.

28:55.405 --> 28:56.999
Oh, hey, Sam.
- Hi.

28:56.999 --> 28:59.900
You need something?
- Uh... yes, I do.

28:59.900 --> 29:02.405
Carl told me to come
and help you prep the bird food

29:02.405 --> 29:04.834
for tomorrow, so... here I am.

29:04.834 --> 29:07.438
And these are the bowls
that the food goes in?

29:07.438 --> 29:09.801
- That’s how it works.
- Yeah, fit it in the bowls.

29:11.273 --> 29:13.405
- Everything okay?
- Everything is 100 percent,

29:13.405 --> 29:14.999
it’s really good.
How... how are you?

29:14.999 --> 29:17.306
Yeah, good. Well, actually,
no, I sliced my...

29:17.306 --> 29:20.966
I sliced my finger open
on one of the boxes,
stings like a bitch.

29:20.966 --> 29:23.537
Yeah, now, I’m bleeding like,
all over my pocket

29:23.537 --> 29:26.273
and I can’t for the life of me
find the first-aid kit.

29:26.273 --> 29:27.570
You need a Band-Aid, Marls?

29:27.570 --> 29:29.306
Here, let me help you,
kit’s over there.

29:29.306 --> 29:30.405
Thanks, hon.

29:31.207 --> 29:32.834
I don’t know why

29:32.834 --> 29:34.240
this keeps happening,
do you think my skin

29:34.240 --> 29:37.207
is thinning or something?
- Don’t be a hypochondriac.

29:37.207 --> 29:39.108
Just keep that finger clean.

29:39.108 --> 29:42.174
You’re right,
I am a hypochondriac.

29:42.174 --> 29:44.438
Um... I...

29:44.438 --> 29:46.207
I’ll be right back.

29:46.207 --> 29:47.471
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:10.933 --> 30:13.537
Hey. What’s your name?

30:13.537 --> 30:15.240
What’s your name?

30:15.240 --> 30:16.570
I’m Kelly.

30:18.438 --> 30:22.075
No, no, no, no.
Come on, no. No!

30:36.141 --> 30:40.174
Hey, Riley? Hi, could you
just stop for a sec?

30:42.042 --> 30:43.339
Riley!

30:44.504 --> 30:45.636
Riley?

30:46.504 --> 30:47.603
Riley!

30:51.339 --> 30:54.240
Riley, stop! GTPD!

30:57.042 --> 30:59.405
You’re a cop? What?
- Yeah, I’m a cop.

30:59.405 --> 31:01.735
Now, show me what’s in those
lumpy pants.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.636
Now, please!

31:09.273 --> 31:11.339
It’s just that
those are turtles.

31:11.999 --> 31:13.471
So where’s the ketamine?

31:14.075 --> 31:16.636
You think I was stealing
the ketamine?

31:18.141 --> 31:20.108
Okay, pull your...
pull your pants.

31:28.405 --> 31:29.504
Hello?

31:36.537 --> 31:38.042
Somebody there?

31:42.240 --> 31:43.438
Hello?

32:01.933 --> 32:05.207
What were you going to do with
those turtles, sell them?

32:05.207 --> 32:09.075
I was re-wilding them, saving
them from mass incarceration.

32:09.075 --> 32:11.669
This place pretends to be
helping animals,

32:11.669 --> 32:14.405
but they are still keeping
them all in cages!

32:14.405 --> 32:16.339
Wow! Just wow!

32:18.504 --> 32:20.570
So, I suppose you’re no further

32:20.570 --> 32:23.438
along on the ketamine?
- Oh... I’ll keep you updated.

32:32.174 --> 32:33.669
Come on, Kel, pick up.

32:43.636 --> 32:45.735
All right, where is this guy?

32:46.273 --> 32:48.108
I told you you should’ve
done it barefoot,

32:48.108 --> 32:49.735
it’s more authentic.
- Barefoot?

32:49.735 --> 32:51.504
Authentic?

32:51.504 --> 32:55.207
Do you know how hard this is?
It’s stupid, I hate it.

32:58.042 --> 32:59.174
All right, here he is.

33:01.636 --> 33:03.603
Ah, here we go.

33:09.240 --> 33:12.174
Hey, I’m KrazeeFreezie, man.
- Cool.

33:12.174 --> 33:14.669
You Switch?
- Uh-huh.

33:18.768 --> 33:20.537
Tim Nadon,
you’re under arrest.

33:20.537 --> 33:22.240
Put your hands behind
your back.

33:24.537 --> 33:27.405
Hey! GTPD! Stop!

33:33.339 --> 33:36.669
Get up. Put your hands
behind your back.

33:36.669 --> 33:39.306
Do you think your mother would
be proud of you right now?

33:39.306 --> 33:40.471
No.

33:43.141 --> 33:44.537
Kelly? Oh my God.

33:44.537 --> 33:47.339
Hey, are you okay?

33:48.306 --> 33:49.768
Yeah, can you hear me?

33:50.636 --> 33:53.108
Kell?

33:54.273 --> 33:56.471
Okay, Kelly...

33:56.471 --> 33:58.834
Someone misted you in the face
with ketamine.

33:58.834 --> 34:01.636
Yeah? And they smashed
the camera.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.504
Hey, it’s me, it’s Sam,
are you with me?

34:04.504 --> 34:06.273
Look at me,
you’re gonna be okay.

34:06.273 --> 34:07.834
I know who you are,
get off of me.

34:07.834 --> 34:10.273
Okay. We’re good, we’re good.

34:10.273 --> 34:12.075
Hey, listen.
- Where the hell am I?

34:12.075 --> 34:13.636
We’re in the sanctuary,
and I’m...

34:13.636 --> 34:15.174
I’m just gonna get you
to the hospital.

34:15.174 --> 34:16.768
No. No. I just...

34:16.768 --> 34:18.603
Help me get up.
- Okay.

34:18.603 --> 34:20.702
- Oh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:20.702 --> 34:22.141
I don’t feel like myself, Sam.

34:22.141 --> 34:23.339
Yeah, yeah,
that’s the ketamine.

34:23.339 --> 34:24.735
So, we’re gonna go
to the hospital.

34:24.735 --> 34:25.735
- No.
- Yes.

34:25.735 --> 34:27.141
It’s not the ketamine, Sam,

34:27.141 --> 34:28.603
it’s not the ketamine,
it’s everything.

34:28.603 --> 34:30.240
Everything is a mess.

34:32.834 --> 34:35.207
I’m trying to get back
to my life,

34:35.207 --> 34:36.834
I’m trying to get back
to Nathan.

34:36.834 --> 34:39.438
Now, I got Brixton...
Don’t touch me.

34:41.735 --> 34:44.735
I can pretend for a few days
with Brixton,

34:44.735 --> 34:46.504
but I can’t pretend
a whole life.

34:47.108 --> 34:49.273
And I’m so used to pretending.

34:49.273 --> 34:51.405
I don’t even know
the difference anymore.

34:51.405 --> 34:52.867
You’re gonna know
the difference.

34:52.867 --> 34:56.108
No, I’m not, Sam,
don’t you get it?

34:57.900 --> 34:59.735
And then, I’m trying
to get back,

34:59.735 --> 35:01.603
I’m trying to get my mind right.

35:02.669 --> 35:04.174
But who is Nathan?

35:04.174 --> 35:06.372
And you, who are you?

35:06.372 --> 35:08.669
And who the hell is this Ro?

35:09.306 --> 35:11.273
And normally, I wouldn’t
even care about it

35:11.273 --> 35:15.339
because I’m not 12 and
I know you have a hard time
making friends, but...

35:16.735 --> 35:20.141
I just don’t know
who I am right now.

35:20.900 --> 35:22.306
I know.

35:23.339 --> 35:25.174
This is just re-entry.

35:28.207 --> 35:30.801
You’re just adjusting.
Take a breath.

35:33.405 --> 35:34.504
Yeah?

35:35.174 --> 35:38.471
There you go.

35:41.867 --> 35:43.834
You need to lean on your pack.

35:45.669 --> 35:46.900
Yeah.

35:47.768 --> 35:48.867
Me...

35:49.933 --> 35:52.207
Naz, Nathan,
we’re your pack.

35:53.174 --> 35:54.339
No.

35:55.174 --> 35:58.933
I think I’m better off...
a lone wolf.

35:58.933 --> 36:00.438
Really?

36:01.603 --> 36:03.372
Because a lone wolf,
that’s just a myth.

36:04.702 --> 36:07.933
Wolves, they hunt in pairs.

36:13.471 --> 36:14.702
Together.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.240
Yeah.

36:20.834 --> 36:22.801
It’s true as well,
it’s like science,

36:22.801 --> 36:24.240
it’s not a thing
I just made up.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.966
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah, it’s a real thing.

36:25.966 --> 36:28.306
No, no, I swear to God.
It’s like a wolf that’s alone

36:28.306 --> 36:29.768
is just a wolf that’s lost.

36:30.966 --> 36:34.306
Kell, you’re not alone.

36:36.306 --> 36:37.768
You got me.

36:43.603 --> 36:44.834
It’s me.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.801
We got this job.

36:51.438 --> 36:52.900
Um.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.867
We’re on a job.
- Mm.

36:54.867 --> 36:56.471
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

36:58.900 --> 37:02.306
So, if you’re okay...

37:04.372 --> 37:05.966
I just need you to think.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.636
Can you remember anything
before you passed out?

37:09.636 --> 37:11.867
Um...

37:12.537 --> 37:15.900
There was a sound...
in the vent.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.966
There was a sound in the vent.
- Okay.

37:29.636 --> 37:30.768
Fetch?

37:32.900 --> 37:35.735
It was Marla,
she had a partner.

37:36.471 --> 37:37.603
Pearl.

37:41.537 --> 37:43.339
Hey, Sam. Did you forget
something?

37:43.339 --> 37:45.636
GTPD, hands in the air.

37:47.504 --> 37:50.669
Put the bag on the ground.
Do it.

38:01.141 --> 38:02.372
What’s this?

38:03.075 --> 38:04.438
I don’t know.

38:04.438 --> 38:05.801
Looks like alimony
payments to me.

38:05.801 --> 38:07.636
Marla Van Beek,
you’re under arrest.

38:07.636 --> 38:08.768
I...

38:09.999 --> 38:11.867
It’s okay, buddy.

38:22.999 --> 38:24.570
How did you do it?

38:24.570 --> 38:26.867
Did you, like, train the bird
to stick his, like,

38:26.867 --> 38:29.075
little beak to the vent
and take the vials?

38:30.108 --> 38:33.768
Because that’s not fetch,
that’s like Bonnie and Clide.

38:33.768 --> 38:36.405
Maybe she got them herself.
- And put them in your bag?

38:36.405 --> 38:37.735
Yeah, she’s very smart.
- Is she?

38:37.735 --> 38:39.372
Mm-hmm.

38:39.834 --> 38:42.933
Okay. So, what is Pearl

38:42.933 --> 38:45.471
gonna do without you there
to administer her medication?

38:45.471 --> 38:46.669
She’ll be fine.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.735
I’ll be replaced, like always.

38:50.636 --> 38:53.702
I stuck by my ex for years,

38:53.702 --> 38:55.108
through all his problems,

38:55.108 --> 38:57.669
and then one little crack
and he bails, and now,

38:57.669 --> 38:59.900
I’m paying for his life?
How is that fair?

38:59.900 --> 39:03.669
That does not give you carte
blanche to steal and sell drugs.

39:03.669 --> 39:05.108
It’s just a little ketamine.

39:05.108 --> 39:06.801
Which is a controlled
substance that you used

39:06.801 --> 39:07.999
to attack Detective Duff!

39:07.999 --> 39:10.504
Yeah, your husband left you,
line up!

39:10.504 --> 39:12.669
That doesn’t give you an excuse
to hurt other people.

39:19.768 --> 39:22.504
Hey. Have you been in here
the whole time?

39:22.504 --> 39:23.702
Yeah.

39:24.669 --> 39:27.636
And look at you, badass!

39:29.603 --> 39:31.471
Well, nobody puts Kelly
in a K-Hole.

39:31.471 --> 39:32.768
Hey!

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
How are you feeling?

39:34.999 --> 39:36.801
I’m still a little fuzzy.

39:37.702 --> 39:40.900
I was tired before the ketamine
and now, I’m really exhausted.

39:43.867 --> 39:46.537
And I feel dumb...

39:47.735 --> 39:49.801
Wazowski, for going out
on a limb to try and prove

39:49.801 --> 39:51.768
that Carl was the guy. I...

39:52.504 --> 39:54.438
I should have listened
to you about Marla.

39:54.438 --> 39:56.801
Well, you and Ro.

39:57.669 --> 39:58.801
Well...

39:58.801 --> 40:02.537
I should have listened to you
with everything else, so...

40:02.537 --> 40:03.999
I’m sorry.

40:05.042 --> 40:08.174
Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I’ll be fine.

40:08.174 --> 40:09.867
Yeah, I know you will.

40:10.504 --> 40:11.966
Bring it in.

40:14.735 --> 40:15.867
I’m so tired.

40:17.141 --> 40:19.174
Well, ain’t this cozy?

40:19.174 --> 40:21.768
Commander Ballard.

40:21.768 --> 40:24.504
Yes. I... I just wanted
to come in here to say

40:24.504 --> 40:27.735
job well done.
Quick, efficient and thorough.

40:28.504 --> 40:30.735
- Thank you.
- Um... maybe we could be

40:30.735 --> 40:33.801
a part of the A team?
Or perhaps, like, even
like the A team.

40:33.801 --> 40:37.174
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

40:46.174 --> 40:47.570
Kell?

40:48.669 --> 40:50.108
I heard what happened.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.768
Are you feeling okay?

40:53.603 --> 40:55.042
Uh...

40:56.933 --> 40:58.999
Yeah, I’m okay.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.273
I’m okay.

41:00.867 --> 41:02.141
Can you come in?

41:02.801 --> 41:04.636
Can you come out?
- No...

41:04.636 --> 41:06.273
Babe, please,
can you just come in?

41:06.273 --> 41:07.933
I’m the only one in here.

41:12.702 --> 41:13.768
Are you sure?

41:13.768 --> 41:15.042
Yeah, yeah.

41:15.669 --> 41:17.570
Just... Can we talk?

41:20.867 --> 41:22.042
Yeah.

41:22.801 --> 41:24.537
What’s up?
- Um...

41:24.537 --> 41:26.570
I’m not okay, okay?

41:26.570 --> 41:29.867
I know I’ve said I’m okay,
but I’m not, I’m struggling.

41:30.966 --> 41:32.900
Just getting back into my life,

41:32.900 --> 41:37.240
watching Brixton,
I’m having a hard time
maintaining all of this.

41:38.603 --> 41:41.240
Yeah, I believe you.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.174
I knew something was up, that’s
why I was trying to help to...

41:48.273 --> 41:50.570
And all I was doing was talking
about how wonderful it is

41:50.570 --> 41:51.834
to have a baby around.

41:52.834 --> 41:54.867
Exactly what you did not need
to be hearing.

41:54.867 --> 41:56.933
I’m sorry.
- No, I just...

41:56.933 --> 41:59.075
I just don’t want you
to see me as incompetent.

41:59.075 --> 42:00.636
- What?
- No, but...

42:01.108 --> 42:03.603
If I can’t even babysit,

42:03.603 --> 42:06.999
what am I gonna do if we have
our own family, Nathan?

42:07.735 --> 42:09.966
And I think I still want
to have kids, but...

42:10.768 --> 42:13.834
I love my job,
my life, my freedom.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.867
And what if having a kid
jeopardizes all of that?

42:17.867 --> 42:19.075
Okay, okay.

42:19.075 --> 42:21.240
Kelly, let’s take a pause.

42:22.702 --> 42:24.306
Here’s the thing.

42:24.306 --> 42:25.834
I just want you.

42:27.570 --> 42:30.900
I’m serious, everything else
is just gravy.

42:30.900 --> 42:34.999
So why don’t we just work out
all the rest together.

42:37.570 --> 42:38.867
Live in the present.

42:41.768 --> 42:42.900
Okay.

42:43.306 --> 42:45.669
Come on, girl.

42:45.669 --> 42:49.933
Let’s go pick up this stupid,
boring, adorable baby,

42:49.933 --> 42:51.867
take it to my place
so you can get some sleep.

42:51.867 --> 42:54.372
- Okay. He cries a lot.
- Yeah, he does, it’s all right.

42:54.372 --> 42:56.207
- Okay, are you sure?
- Yeah, I’m building up

42:56.207 --> 42:59.339
my coochie coupons.
- Coochie coupon, two’s company.

42:59.339 --> 43:01.108
Three is a family.

43:02.174 --> 43:03.999
All right, you say it now.

43:03.999 --> 43:05.966
I’m saying it,
three is a family.

43:34.636 --> 43:36.933
difuze
