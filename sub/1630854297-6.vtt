WEBVTT

00:11.245 --> 00:13.381
Come on, Davis, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.089
Your Honor,
I'm asking you to dismiss

00:21.189 --> 00:22.723
the indictment in this case.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.926
On what grounds, Ms. Jones?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.629
ADA Davis hasn't even
bothered to show up.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.199
I came as fast
as I could.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.500
Your nephew's
in there fuming.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.967
I know, he's
been texting me.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.503
Any word from Davis?
Nada.

00:35.603 --> 00:39.373
My client, Manny Vargas,
deserves a speedy trial.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.242
And if the DA's office

00:41.342 --> 00:43.311
continues to drag it out,

00:43.411 --> 00:44.978
the case should be dismissed.

00:46.714 --> 00:50.084
My apologies, Your Honor.
I'm stepping in for ADA Davis.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.087
How convenient.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.688
We will proceed as planned,
but, Ms. Reagan,

00:54.788 --> 00:56.190
you should know that
before you got here,

00:56.290 --> 00:58.859
the defense made a motion
to dismiss the indictment.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.395
Well, with all due respect,
Your Honor, that's ridiculous.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.663
The defendant was in possession

01:02.763 --> 01:04.332
of more than
12 ounces of cocaine.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.767
I agree, but if your ADA is
also aware of the severity of

01:06.867 --> 01:10.070
these charges, he would've
been here on time.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.805
Yes, Your Honor.

01:11.905 --> 01:12.873
Any word from Davis?

01:12.973 --> 01:14.242
Still nothing.

01:14.342 --> 01:15.543
Okay, call my office,
get his address.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.178
I already pulled
his address.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.079
Great. Go find him and get
him here, immediately.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.519
Well, that's about it.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.188
There's one more thing.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.290
You're absolutely positive

01:29.390 --> 01:31.859
you don't want to attend?

01:33.060 --> 01:37.431
Garrett, I thought we already
told them I am not available.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.099
We did.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.571
And they basically
came back with "you sure?"

01:43.671 --> 01:45.939
They're very persistent.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.176
It's their own damn fault.

01:48.276 --> 01:51.245
Last time was a flat-out ambush.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.482
And it was used in the press
to hurt the department.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.450
They should've done
a much better job

01:56.550 --> 01:57.651
of vetting
the students' questions.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.420
That was three years ago.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.654
All those students
have graduated.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.090
The professors behind it
are still there.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.959
This is New York College
for Criminal Justice,

02:06.059 --> 02:09.363
they're not exactly known
for their anti-cop sentiments.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.865
But a few professors
with an agenda

02:11.965 --> 02:14.568
are doing their best
to change that.

02:17.004 --> 02:20.608
Well, there's something else
you should know.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.844
When you turned them down,
they asked

02:23.944 --> 02:27.147
for someone else
to attend in your place.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.651
Sid Gormley.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.456
You're kidding me.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.592
What did you do
after Sid said "no way"?

02:39.393 --> 02:40.861
That's the thing.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.696
What's the thing?

02:42.796 --> 02:45.666
Sid really wants to do it.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.969
He hates public speaking.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.672
What the hell is
going on here, Garrett?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.508
Nothing's going on, Frank.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.777
Under the circumstances,

02:56.877 --> 02:59.347
maybe you should join him.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.082
Safety in numbers.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.521
No is no all day long.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.095
Whew.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.813
They're not done with her yet.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.948
Just have--
just stay out here, okay?

03:37.618 --> 03:38.986
Hey, what do we got?

03:39.086 --> 03:40.654
Vic is 40-year-old
Maritza Lopez.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.556
She owns the store
with her husband.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.591
What's his story?

03:43.691 --> 03:44.758
He's pretty shaken up,

03:44.858 --> 03:46.059
says she was hit
by a stray bullet

03:46.159 --> 03:47.661
while they were
stocking shelves inside.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.829
When was this?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.564
About 30 minutes ago.
Witnesses?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.533
So you'd think. Broad daylight.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.634
No one's talking?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.269
Everyone seems to love Maritza.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.437
Her neighbors are shaken

03:56.537 --> 03:58.672
and I saw a lot of tears,
but yeah,

03:58.772 --> 04:00.073
it cleared out pretty quick
when we rolled up.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.241
Tale as old as time.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.343
No go.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.011
No!

04:04.111 --> 04:05.679
Mr. Lopez, you can't
be in there.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.581
Mr. Lopez!

04:08.882 --> 04:10.851
Come back from behind
there. You can't be back--

04:10.951 --> 04:12.786
Gun! Gun! He's got a gun!

04:12.886 --> 04:14.288
Step back, step back.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.323
Hey! Hey!

04:15.423 --> 04:17.358
Drop the gun right now.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.293
Drop the gun!
Who are you?

04:19.393 --> 04:20.761
I'm a detective.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.496
I need you to put
that gun down, right now.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.864
I was supposed
to protect her.

04:23.964 --> 04:24.998
I understand
you're upset, okay?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.667
No, you don't. How could you?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.235
'Cause my wife was murdered, too.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.938
I should be dead, not her.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.673
Yeah, I thought the same thing
and I was wrong.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.342
Now take your finger
off that trigger,

04:34.442 --> 04:35.609
put the gun down, right now.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.411
I have nothing to live for.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.879
You got kids?

04:39.747 --> 04:40.881
Sir, do you have kids?

04:40.981 --> 04:41.782
Two boys.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.317
Two boys.
Just like me.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.218
We got a lot in
common, you and I.

04:45.319 --> 04:48.155
I found the guy who
killed my boys' mom.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.992
Give me a chance to find the
guy who killed your boys' mom.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.852
Mr. Davis?

05:20.253 --> 05:22.590
Mr. Davis?

05:23.724 --> 05:25.393
Mr. Davis?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.061
Robert.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.630
Are you serious?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.732
Robert.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.301
What the--

05:37.871 --> 05:38.806
What time is it?

05:38.906 --> 05:39.973
You were due in court

05:40.073 --> 05:40.908
two hours ago.
Good morning.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.444
Are you serious?

05:43.544 --> 05:45.212
You're going to ruin
this entire case.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.246
Years of work,
down the drain. For what?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.347
So you can have
a good time?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.616
All right,
okay, cool it.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.117
Really?
Cool it.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.752
What the hell happened?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.220
I don't know.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.955
I don't... I don't even
remember getting home.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.056
Well, looks like
you had a great time.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.458
I know what this
might look like,

05:57.558 --> 05:58.826
but I haven't had a
drink in over a year.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.628
I've been killing
myself to stay sober.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.363
And even when I did drink,
I-I know my limits.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.932
Take it easy.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.333
I've never
seen him drunk

06:06.434 --> 06:08.469
and I've seen him down
three martinis at lunch.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.770
What the hell happened?

06:09.870 --> 06:12.139
What's the last
thing you remember?

06:12.239 --> 06:14.074
Uh, I was on a date.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.342
With who?
Some girl.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.710
Does she have a name?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.045
Monique...

06:18.145 --> 06:19.346
something, I...

06:19.447 --> 06:20.448
Look, I don't
even have her number.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.348
We were...
We met on an app.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.916
Where'd you meet her at?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.351
The Old Town Bar on 18th.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.786
You honestly
expect us to believe

06:25.886 --> 06:27.220
that you and this woman
met at Old Town Bar

06:27.320 --> 06:28.456
and you didn't have a drink?

06:28.556 --> 06:29.723
I swear.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.566
Boss, you
got a moment?

06:38.666 --> 06:40.568
I do.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.771
Garrett told me he mentioned

06:43.871 --> 06:46.006
I'm gonna speak at the New York
College for Criminal Justice.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.475
He did.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.544
I just want you to know:
I'm very excited about it.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.716
Well, to be honest, Sid,
I'm not.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.051
Boss, I know I should've
asked your permission,

06:58.151 --> 07:01.221
but I see it as my job
to cover your six o'clock.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.657
You hate public speaking.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.258
I know, but it's time
for me to step up, okay?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.694
So, I'm gonna hit the books

07:06.794 --> 07:09.530
and trust me, I'm gonna
be ready to support

07:09.630 --> 07:12.399
all my brothers and sisters
in law enforcement.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.136
Sid, we defend what
we do by our actions.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.205
What our officers
do on the street,

07:18.305 --> 07:19.740
for everyone to see.

07:21.308 --> 07:25.345
Look, I appreciate
the gesture, I really do,

07:25.445 --> 07:28.148
but, uh, tell them
you've changed your mind.

07:28.248 --> 07:32.452
Boss, please, come on,
a little respect?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.258
So...

07:38.358 --> 07:40.160
why the sudden change?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.663
What's going on, Sid?

07:42.763 --> 07:46.433
There's nothing's going on...

07:46.534 --> 07:49.770
but, um...
okay, here's the thing.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.005
What's the thing?

07:54.942 --> 07:57.578
Now you got me all confused. Um...

07:57.678 --> 07:59.412
You're twisting
my words, boss.

07:59.513 --> 08:03.383
Uh, the thing is your dad.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.053
The thing is my dad?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.988
Yes, they asked him to do it

08:08.088 --> 08:10.624
and I didn't think he should
be up there all alone.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.426
Well, he really shouldn't.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.995
And I didn't want to offend you

08:15.095 --> 08:18.465
by implying Henry couldn't
do it on his own, okay?

08:18.566 --> 08:20.634
Because he sounded
very excited about it.

08:22.002 --> 08:26.073
So, boss, I don't want you
to worry about it.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.575
I am his backup

08:27.675 --> 08:31.679
and I am gonna fill in
all the blanks, all right?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.887
That guy claims
he's sober,

08:39.987 --> 08:41.689
but he got totally
wasted last night.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.057
Even when he used to be
here eight times a week,

08:44.157 --> 08:45.092
I never saw
him like that.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.126
And you served him alcohol?

08:46.226 --> 08:47.728
No, I think he showed up tanked.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.263
Or he was sneaking mini bottles
into his club sodas.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.800
Lot of our "recovering"
patrons do that.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.001
Who was he with?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.135
Some girl.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.737
Remember what
she looked like?

08:56.837 --> 08:59.740
Blonde broad,
looked strung out.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.108
But she got him into a cab
at the end of the night,

09:01.208 --> 09:02.242
so I was thankful
for that.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.978
Do those
surveillance cameras work?

09:11.418 --> 09:14.655
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
play that back.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.291
You see that?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.660
She slipped him a mickey.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.028
Well, we don't know
exactly what it was.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.830
Well, what was she
putting in there? Viagra?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.998
I told you he ain't a bad guy.
He's the victim.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.667
Yeah, well,
he should've never put himself

09:26.767 --> 09:28.335
in this situation to begin with.
Give him a break.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.037
Guy's trying to better himself.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.371
And then this happens.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.906
Come on.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.644
All right.
Let's go find her.

09:36.744 --> 09:37.845
See who put her up to this.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.479
Thank you.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.414
So, it was a shoot-out?

09:41.514 --> 09:43.416
No. Guy on a scooter
pulled up on a parked car

09:43.516 --> 09:44.952
and fired shots.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.419
Well, did the camera catch
either of their plates?

09:46.519 --> 09:48.121
No. The scooter didn't
have any plates,

09:48.221 --> 09:49.522
the car had temporary plates,

09:49.623 --> 09:50.891
we ran them, nothing popped.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.525
Well, maybe we can
canvass the neighborhood,

09:52.626 --> 09:55.195
see if anyone recognizes
the scooter or the car.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.065
Right, 'cause everyone in that
neighborhood wants to help us.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.399
Hey.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.901
Hey, now is not
a good time.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.035
It's about
your case.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.771
What about our case?

10:03.871 --> 10:05.238
I just interviewed a woman

10:05.338 --> 10:06.406
arrested on a gun charge.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.908
She says she knows
the son of a bitch

10:08.008 --> 10:09.242
who shot your vic,
Maritza Lopez.
You're kidding.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.543
That's great. Yeah.

10:10.644 --> 10:11.812
She says his name
is Elijah Martin.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.513
You run him?
Yeah, I ran his name.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.015
No record, but
I got an address.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.117
Great.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.652
Could be this woman
is just trying

10:18.752 --> 10:19.920
to get herself out
of a jam, though.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.522
I mean, this case
is all over TV.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.424
Yeah, but still,
we'll look into it.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.459
Yeah, for sure.
Let's look into it.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.963
Oh, thanks for coming by.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.665
Oh, yeah, thanks.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.834
I don't need
to remind you guys

10:33.934 --> 10:35.936
that I'm now
Field Intelligence Sergeant.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.471
Yeah, I-I heard that.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.040
Yeah, congrats.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.442
Yeah, so, I was instructed

10:42.542 --> 10:44.177
to bring you guys
this information

10:44.277 --> 10:46.747
from my boss, Lt. Fleming.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.581
Highly credible,
vetted by my team.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.617
Great. And, like she said,

10:50.718 --> 10:52.052
we'll look into it.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.486
Yeah, you should jump
on this immediately.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.255
Yeah, well, we will.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.656
It's not your case, it's ours.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.059
If it was mine,
I'd already be out the door.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.494
And so would we if were weren't
stuck here still talking to you.

11:01.594 --> 11:02.696
Come on, I want in
on this, all right?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.131
I'd like to follow up
on my lead.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.833
Please?

11:08.401 --> 11:09.469
Fine.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.504
But you ride in the back seat.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.377
Manny's crew
owns this block.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.179
I guess that's why
it's so charming.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.647
Manny used addicts
all the time

11:20.748 --> 11:22.415
to do his dirty work
in exchange for drugs.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.517
And you've been able
to flip some of them?

11:24.617 --> 11:26.754
If they can
stand up straight.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.156
Would you look who it is?

11:30.457 --> 11:31.591
Hey, Monique?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.126
Do I know you?

11:33.226 --> 11:34.394
You know my friend, Manny.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.063
Are you a cop?

11:36.163 --> 11:37.564
Now why would
you say that?

11:37.664 --> 11:38.899
Because you look like a cop.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.333
And he looks like
an even bigger one.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.035
Oh, shoot,
she got us.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.270
You mind coming with us?

11:43.370 --> 11:44.437
We got some questions
about last night.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.939
Last night?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.307
I mean, I was home last night.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.475
You were?
That's funny.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.376
Because we have
surveillance footage

11:49.476 --> 11:50.710
that shows otherwise.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.980
Look, you got the wrong girl.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.215
Just go bother
someone else.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.383
Give me that.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.284
What the hell
are you doing?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.618
Thank you very much.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.687
What do you got
in there, Monique?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.624
Ah, I bet one of those matches

12:04.724 --> 12:06.426
what was slipped into
Davis's drink.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.895
I bet it does, too.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.396
Very bad, Monique.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.497
Turn around.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.664
You're under arrest.

12:11.765 --> 12:12.699
Oh, Monique.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.168
You're breaking
our heart.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.670
Police. Open up.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.640
May I help you?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.475
Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.644
We're looking for
Elijah Martin.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.613
Okay, is
something wrong?

12:26.713 --> 12:28.081
Is he here, ma'am?
Well, what's it regarding?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.450
His name came up
in an investigation

12:30.550 --> 12:31.684
and we'd like
to talk to him.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.086
Oh, well, you must be mistaken.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.521
Could you just tell us
if he's here or not

12:34.621 --> 12:35.923
so we could speak to him?

12:36.023 --> 12:38.625
Ma, have you
seen my sneaker...

12:40.894 --> 12:42.963
Elijah, what the
hell is going on?

12:43.063 --> 12:44.898
What's wrong
with you?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.034
Hey!

12:49.102 --> 12:50.337
Get away from the
window. Come on.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.805
Hands up, hands up!

12:51.905 --> 12:53.440
Step away from
the window.
Oh, my God.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.842
Relax, relax.
God, Elijah.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.576
What have you done?

12:57.577 --> 12:58.879
What <i>have</i>
you done?

13:09.589 --> 13:11.024
Where were you
this morning?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.659
I was at school.
Really?

13:12.759 --> 13:14.561
Because that's not
what your school said.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.429
They said you'd been
absent all week.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.298
Okay, so I-I wasn't at school.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.699
Okay, so, then
where were you?

13:19.799 --> 13:20.901
I slept in, okay?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.069
I was in bed.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.270
Think your mom
will confirm

13:23.370 --> 13:24.437
that that's
where you were?

13:24.537 --> 13:25.705
Of course she will.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.207
I think you were
out cruising around

13:27.307 --> 13:30.143
firing a gun at
innocent people.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.445
You don't understand.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.381
Well, maybe you should
help me understand.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.183
'Cause all I understand
right now

13:36.283 --> 13:37.584
is a woman is in the morgue

13:37.684 --> 13:38.986
and I'm pretty sure
it's because of you.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.720
I didn't shoot her!

13:41.654 --> 13:42.923
You didn't shoot her

13:43.023 --> 13:44.557
or you didn't mean to shoot her?

13:44.657 --> 13:45.625
Which one?

13:45.725 --> 13:47.294
I-I didn't mean to.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.062
You got to believe me,

13:49.162 --> 13:50.998
I didn't have a choice.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.966
You pulled the trigger.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.001
You had a choice.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.702
Panos said I had to do it

13:55.802 --> 13:58.138
if I wanted to
work for him.
Who's Panos?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.373
The leader of the crew.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.375
He lives in
my building.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.111
Well, you realize
you admitted that you're guilty,

14:04.211 --> 14:06.079
right?
I'm sorry.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.514
I never wanted
to hurt that woman.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.082
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.084
Maybe so.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.452
But you did.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.221
In fact, you killed someone.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.556
Sit tight.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.657
Why'd you do it?

14:18.825 --> 14:20.427
Panos runs
our neighborhood.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.462
It's either work for him,
or end up dead.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.730
I did what
I had to do.

14:23.830 --> 14:24.864
Who'd he ask you to kill?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.366
Some guy named Marco.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.834
He's part of
a rival crew.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.402
Panos said he's been
stepping on his territory.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.072
So, Panos ordered you
to kill Marco?

14:32.172 --> 14:33.740
Yes.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.943
But you killed
someone else instead.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.847
Sit tight.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.855
There you go.
He confessed.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.890
Case closed.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.059
Well, I also
heard him say

14:52.159 --> 14:53.326
that he was ordered
to make the hit.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.995
Yeah, he was ordered
to make a hit

14:55.095 --> 14:56.496
because I also heard him say

14:56.596 --> 14:58.098
that he wanted to join the gang.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.499
But he botched the hit and left

14:59.599 --> 15:01.201
two boys to grow up
without their mother.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.702
If we can get Elijah
to make a deal,

15:02.802 --> 15:04.137
then we can use him
to take down Panos

15:04.237 --> 15:05.205
and his crew.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.240
Look, he's not the one, okay?

15:07.340 --> 15:08.675
You saw how
quick he flipped.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.177
He'll never hold up
out on the street.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.678
Danny, my entire
job is about

15:11.778 --> 15:13.280
using a small fish
to catch a bigger fish.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.681
That's exactly
what this is.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.383
And I'm all about
catching a bigger fish,

15:16.483 --> 15:17.985
but he's not
the right bait.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.421
Look, I promised this
woman's husband justice.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.156
And he's gonna get it.
Justice?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.724
He might look like a grown man,

15:24.824 --> 15:26.493
but mentally he's more
on par with a seventh grader.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.361
He-he doesn't know what
he was getting himself into.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.762
He knows right
from wrong,

15:29.862 --> 15:30.930
he said it himself.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.433
Look, I know you
got a new job, okay?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.135
And you'd like another
gold star from Teacher,

15:35.235 --> 15:36.136
but this ain't that.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.437
This is not about me

15:37.537 --> 15:39.039
trying to prove myself
at my new job.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.840
If we can get Panos collared

15:40.940 --> 15:43.576
and serving state time, then
we can maybe have a chance

15:43.676 --> 15:45.212
to bring some peace
back to that neighborhood.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.980
"Peace back
to the neighborhood"?

15:47.080 --> 15:49.116
What-- This isn't an
after-school special, kid.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.318
There will never be
peace in the neighborhood.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.719
Someone will replace Panos

15:52.819 --> 15:54.621
in a week and we'll
be back to square one.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.623
He's worth more to us as a trade

15:56.723 --> 15:58.558
than he is as a collar
and you know it.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.460
We'll get Panos another time,

16:00.560 --> 16:01.894
with another fish.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.964
This kid won't
make it out there.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.966
Forget it. It's not happening.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.277
Who told you to meet
with ADA Davis?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.612
I got a call
from Manny yesterday,

16:19.712 --> 16:22.882
asking me to keep Davis
from trial this morning.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.552
Did he say why he wanted
to keep him from trial?

16:25.652 --> 16:26.753
No, but I knew.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.555
He wanted to get Davis fired.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.557
Why do you think that?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.526
Because Davis
stopped cooperating.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.463
What do you mean by
"cooperating"?

16:36.563 --> 16:37.930
Look, there's
more I can say,

16:38.031 --> 16:40.600
but only if you guarantee me
some sort of deal.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.670
We got you on video
putting something

16:43.770 --> 16:45.772
into ADA Davis's drink.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.175
I'm sure the lab
results will say

16:48.275 --> 16:50.810
it's the same narcotic
that we found in your purse.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.245
Which is a felony,
so you're not really

16:52.345 --> 16:53.646
in a position to ask for favors.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.248
You think I'm scared
of some jail time?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.983
Manny finds out
I talked to you,

16:57.084 --> 16:58.651
it's a death sentence.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.654
Okay, so maybe we can
sweeten the deal.

17:01.754 --> 17:02.855
Depends how sweet we're talking.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.891
It depends on what
you have to say.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.500
Manny caught wind
that Davis was in deep

17:13.600 --> 17:14.901
with some guy from Yonkers--

17:15.001 --> 17:17.570
like, we're talking like
$100,000 or something.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.971
So...

17:19.072 --> 17:22.642
Manny offered
to pay off Davis's debt,

17:22.742 --> 17:25.378
in exchange for
the occasional favor.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.948
Are you suggesting that Davis

17:29.048 --> 17:32.319
threw previous cases
in Manny's favor?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.254
Yeah.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.223
But recently,

17:36.323 --> 17:38.024
Davis stopped cooperating.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.727
Manny got pissed off
and wanted to screw him over.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.263
I always suspected
there was a reason

17:43.363 --> 17:44.831
your office
couldn't nail them.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.266
Easy, Joe.
Do you have any idea

17:46.366 --> 17:47.500
how many lives Manny
and his crew

17:47.600 --> 17:48.901
absolutely destroyed?

17:49.001 --> 17:50.403
Yes, I do.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.871
Which is why we will
thoroughly investigate

17:51.971 --> 17:53.072
the allegations.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.441
In the meantime...

17:55.942 --> 17:58.678
...do you have anything
to back this up?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.981
You give me your best offer,

18:02.081 --> 18:03.716
I'll give you
everything you need.

18:14.794 --> 18:19.732
Seven letter word for hinder.
Starts with "S."

18:20.767 --> 18:21.801
Stymied.

18:29.809 --> 18:34.614
So, I hear you accepted
an invitation to speak at

18:34.714 --> 18:37.450
the New York College
for Criminal Justice.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.618
Yeah, I did.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.753
I'm very
excited about it.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.959
That's exactly
what Sid said. Mm.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.597
So, what's so
exciting about it?

18:51.564 --> 18:52.999
You're fishing.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.734
No, I'm not.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.570
What, you don't think
I can handle it?

18:58.605 --> 18:59.672
It's speaking.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.508
You handle that
function quite well.

19:01.608 --> 19:06.479
It is the keeping quiet part
that you struggle with.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.282
Look, you need
to be there.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.650
And you know it.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.685
But if you're not
going to go, I'll go.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.888
The Commissioner's Office
needs to be represented.

19:15.988 --> 19:20.260
Pop, I represented
the Commissioner's Office

19:20.360 --> 19:23.396
at that very event
for many years

19:23.496 --> 19:25.532
and with great pleasure.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.434
Wasn't me
who pulled a fast one.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.236
No argument there.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.070
But you're still going.

19:31.871 --> 19:35.074
Well, somebody's got
to back up Sid.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.243
I love the guy, but...

19:37.610 --> 19:40.280
Pop, it is with good reason
I'm not going.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.349
I know that, Francis.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.551
They haven't earned it.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.119
You're probably
right about that.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.622
You're doing that thing.

19:49.722 --> 19:50.923
What thing?

19:51.023 --> 19:53.560
That thing where you pretend
to agree with me

19:53.660 --> 19:55.528
as a way of
disagreeing with me.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.163
You're probably right.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.831
There, you did it again.

19:58.931 --> 19:59.966
So I did.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.802
Yeah, well,
knock it off, will you?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.304
Please?

20:06.606 --> 20:09.141
I'm not going
and that's that.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.983
Hey, did you
find Monique?

20:17.083 --> 20:18.718
Yep, and we got
proof she drugged you.

20:18.818 --> 20:19.752
Oh, thank God.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.153
But she had
a lot to say.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.422
Like what?

20:22.522 --> 20:24.391
That you're in cahoots
with Manny.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.095
You don't believe her,
do you?

20:29.195 --> 20:30.530
I do.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.031
You're really gonna trust
the bitch that drugged me?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.733
Man, you are no
better than she is.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.602
Who knows how many victims
suffered at Manny's hands

20:35.702 --> 20:37.304
because you helped him get off?

20:37.404 --> 20:38.471
I'm the victim here.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.307
Oh, give me a break.
Okay, calm down.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.208
You're not helping here.
I'm not helping?

20:42.309 --> 20:44.711
I just blew this entire
case wide open for you.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.279
This guy made your entire
office look like fools.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.381
Especially you.
Don't talk to her like that.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.482
I'm sorry that
I actually care

20:49.582 --> 20:50.817
about the people
affected by him,

20:50.917 --> 20:52.319
and not just the
reputation of your office.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.720
I suggest you get the hell
out of here right now

20:53.820 --> 20:56.423
before I put you
through the wall.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.957
Now.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.063
Excuse me.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.236
So what now?

21:12.004 --> 21:14.807
I went back and reviewed
your last two cases

21:14.907 --> 21:16.943
against Manny's cartel

21:17.043 --> 21:19.679
and I believe you
intentionally threw both cases.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.281
That's a huge allegation,
and a reach.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.016
And I'm offended that you
would even think that of me.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.418
Well, I don't want
to believe it.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.753
You know me.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.455
We've worked together for years.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.057
The defense was one step ahead
of this office in both cases.

21:31.157 --> 21:34.126
It makes sense that someone
was feeding them information.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.662
And I believe with
a thorough investigation,

21:35.762 --> 21:37.964
it will prove that it was you.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.699
Erin, look,
you got to believe me.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.767
I got an addiction

21:40.867 --> 21:42.335
and they preyed on me.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.003
That's why I got sober,

21:44.103 --> 21:45.372
so that I could turn my life
around and do the right thing.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.375
Well, I am glad
that you saw the light,

21:48.475 --> 21:49.742
but you chose to do this.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.378
Just give me a chance
to explain myself.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.647
You should save
your explanation for court.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.683
Really, Erin?

21:56.783 --> 21:58.751
Really.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.721
So I guess that
means I'm fired.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.424
You should consider
this the last time

22:04.524 --> 22:06.793
you ever step in this office.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.036
Detective.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.771
Hey.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.641
Andre.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.713
Any update
on who killed my wife?

22:26.813 --> 22:29.181
Yeah, we got
a full confession.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.317
Who was it?

22:31.418 --> 22:32.719
I can't tell you
that right now.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.153
Not yet, anyway.

22:34.253 --> 22:36.389
When I can, you'll be
the first person I call.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.257
So, he's been arrested?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.059
Yes.

22:42.228 --> 22:45.632
Good. I don't know
how to thank you.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.734
You don't have
to thank me at all.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.869
You just go home and
take care of those kids

22:49.969 --> 22:52.805
and, uh, I'll call you
as soon as I can.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.743
Hang in there.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.279
What?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.281
I just got a call
from Central Booking.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.151
Jamie pulled Elijah
out for questioning.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.691
I'll be back.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.931
You went over my head
and went to Central Booking

23:19.031 --> 23:22.569
to talk to my perp after
I told you to stay out of it?

23:22.669 --> 23:23.736
You don't do that.
It's my case.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.004
I didn't do
anything wrong.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.573
I sat down with Elijah
and told him

23:26.673 --> 23:28.040
I'd put in a good word
with the ADA if he cooperated.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.909
You know that's not
how this works.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.310
We shouldn't be
discussing this here.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.713
No, we shouldn't be
discussing it at all

23:33.813 --> 23:34.747
because it never
should've happened.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.248
Any other cop that did this,

23:36.348 --> 23:37.884
you'd be fine with it.
No, if it was a different cop,

23:37.984 --> 23:40.186
I'd put my foot up their ass!

23:40.286 --> 23:42.789
The only cop I can think of
who would do this is you.

23:42.889 --> 23:43.990
Why don't you
get out of here

23:44.090 --> 23:45.492
before you
embarrass yourself?

23:45.592 --> 23:47.393
The only embarrassment
here is you,

23:47.494 --> 23:49.161
to the whole family.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.672
I spoke with the ADA

23:59.772 --> 24:01.741
and they're offering
leniency to Elijah

24:01.841 --> 24:03.943
if he assists in
helping us take down Panos.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.311
Are you crazy?

24:05.411 --> 24:07.547
Messing with Panos
will get us both killed.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.549
That's why we're offering
both of you protection.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.083
We need both
of your cooperation

24:11.183 --> 24:12.451
if this is going to work.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.053
What exactly are we
talking about here?

24:14.153 --> 24:15.354
Elijah would set up a meeting

24:15.454 --> 24:16.856
with Panos
in a controlled setting

24:16.956 --> 24:18.691
and get Panos to admit
that he ordered the hit.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.827
You want my baby
to wear a wire?

24:20.927 --> 24:22.428
We have very
advanced stuff now,

24:22.529 --> 24:24.797
the room would be wired.
Panos would have no idea.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.266
I don't know.
This-this seems risky.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.368
Elijah?

24:32.004 --> 24:33.840
I want to do it.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.944
It's my fault an
innocent woman is dead

24:38.044 --> 24:40.513
and if this is the
way to make it right,

24:40.613 --> 24:43.616
then I don't care what happens.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.886
It's the right thing to do.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.800
What's up?

25:05.805 --> 25:07.907
What's wrong? What happened?

25:10.643 --> 25:12.411
Robert Davis hung himself
last night.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.080
What?

25:15.147 --> 25:17.349
Oh, my God.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.423
This is on me.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.825
Don't even go there.

25:25.925 --> 25:29.428
I shouldn't have let him
leave the office. No.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.430
We had no reason to think
he would hurt himself.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.532
Didn't we?

25:33.633 --> 25:35.034
I was too hard on him.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.670
I-I fired him and I wouldn't
even let him speak.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.171
You didn't put him
in that position.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.306
Oh, my God.

25:40.406 --> 25:41.941
He brought it on himself.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.376
Who found him?

25:45.578 --> 25:46.713
His super.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.753
Did he leave a note or anything?

25:55.487 --> 25:57.657
He left a lot more than a note.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.866
If you want to know, you could
talk to your husband about it,

26:06.966 --> 26:09.168
I'm sure he'll be happy
to tell you behind my back.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.537
I think what my brother
is referring to

26:11.638 --> 26:13.172
is a case
I've been working

26:13.272 --> 26:14.173
that I'd rather
not discuss.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.407
You mean my case.

26:15.507 --> 26:16.542
The one I solved for you.

26:16.643 --> 26:17.810
I didn't need your help.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.878
Really? Because
last time I checked,

26:18.978 --> 26:20.379
I found you your perp. No,

26:20.479 --> 26:21.648
someone brought you a name

26:21.748 --> 26:23.049
and you passed it forward
to the detective

26:23.149 --> 26:24.183
whose case it was, me.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.517
What are you trying to say?

26:25.618 --> 26:26.552
That what I do
isn't real police work?

26:26.653 --> 26:27.486
I didn't say any such thing.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.420
Enough. Enough.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.889
Guys, come on.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.624
Enough, you guys.
You can do this somewhere else,

26:31.724 --> 26:32.725
like romper room.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.093
Yeah, your sister's right.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.963
This isn't the time
or the place, okay?

26:39.098 --> 26:42.434
Well, I'm going to cheer
you all up, with some cake.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.536
Cake?

26:45.972 --> 26:48.174
Are we celebrating
something special?

26:48.274 --> 26:50.743
Yeah, what are we celebrating?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.478
We are celebrating

26:52.578 --> 26:54.814
cake with cake.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.318
Celebrating cake, okay.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.553
I think what she's
trying to say is:

27:01.654 --> 27:03.155
cake makes everything better.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.290
Oh, of course.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.457
Exactly.

27:05.557 --> 27:06.893
You don't need
a reason for cake.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.195
Always so helpful.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.797
Always so bitter.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.766
Look, you guys need to settle
this somewhere else.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.467
You're right.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.036
Uh, I'll make it easy on Jamie.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.170
Good night.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.906
Danny...

27:21.507 --> 27:22.441
No, no, no,
you can't leave.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.442
I brought cake.

27:23.542 --> 27:25.144
Jamie can have my cake,

27:25.244 --> 27:27.013
and eat it, too.

27:30.883 --> 27:31.951
Danny, come on,
wait up.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.152
I got nothing
to say to you.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.153
Danny.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.587
What?

27:35.688 --> 27:36.588
You really don't see why
I thought this was worth it?

27:36.689 --> 27:38.090
No, I don't.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.692
I think you're taking
this case too personally.

27:39.792 --> 27:40.793
Mm-hmm,
how's that?

27:40.893 --> 27:42.461
The husband feeling guilty

27:42.561 --> 27:43.730
for the wife's death,

27:43.830 --> 27:45.297
two young boys
coming up without a mom.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.733
That's got nothing to do with
anything. It's a coincidence.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.801
I'm just saying,
take a step back.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.436
Look, we see things
differently, okay?

27:50.536 --> 27:51.437
We always have.

27:51.537 --> 27:52.504
So, why don't we just

27:52.604 --> 27:54.373
continue to
agree to disagree?

27:54.473 --> 27:56.575
Look, no argument
there. All right?
Good.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.244
And never go over
my head again.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.079
I was making collars
when you were in diapers.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.048
Oh, so this is about me not
being cop enough for you?

28:02.148 --> 28:03.015
Is that it?
No.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.416
It's about you
doing the job

28:04.516 --> 28:05.818
like you're still
a Harvard law student.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.054
Your way isn't
the only way, Danny.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.588
It's like you're just
pissed off and jealous

28:09.688 --> 28:11.090
that I'm not some
rookie cop anymore,

28:11.190 --> 28:12.391
that I'm not your-your
younger brother

28:12.491 --> 28:13.993
who hasn't
made sergeant.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.561
Oh, you think I'm
jealous that you made sergeant?

28:15.661 --> 28:17.063
Let me tell
you something.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.098
Stripes don't
make the cop, okay?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.133
I think you're jealous
because I'm good at what I do,

28:21.233 --> 28:22.534
because you don't
know everything

28:22.634 --> 28:23.635
there is to know
about being a cop,

28:23.736 --> 28:24.904
and, yeah, now I outrank you.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.705
I don't give a damn
about your rank, okay?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.908
I give a damn about doing
the job the right way

28:29.008 --> 28:30.442
and catching
bad guys, period.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.111
This was the right play.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.445
The bigger bad guy
goes down.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.480
Why can't you see that?

28:34.580 --> 28:36.648
Did it ever occur to you

28:36.749 --> 28:38.250
to check your source?

28:38.350 --> 28:39.986
Did you ever
think to ask

28:40.086 --> 28:44.023
why she gave up
Elijah's name so easy?

29:01.307 --> 29:02.641
I assume you
asked us here

29:02.741 --> 29:06.212
to say ADA Davis
has been reassigned?

29:06.312 --> 29:10.116
ADA Davis died by suicide.

29:10.216 --> 29:13.085
I guess his demons
finally got to him, huh?

29:13.185 --> 29:14.453
Be quiet.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.222
Show some respect, smartass.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.558
We're here to inform
you that in addition

29:19.658 --> 29:21.360
to the charges of
drug trafficking,

29:21.460 --> 29:22.962
we will be filing
new charges.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.798
Bribery in the first degree,

29:25.898 --> 29:28.200
menacing in the first degree,

29:28.300 --> 29:30.536
and obstruction of
governmental administration

29:30.636 --> 29:31.871
in the second degree.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.673
Give me a break.
With what evidence?

29:34.773 --> 29:37.509
Robert Davis left us
a sworn affidavit

29:37.609 --> 29:39.311
owning up to his mistakes,

29:39.411 --> 29:40.813
and admitting that he
worked for your client.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.714
It's not admissible in court.

29:42.815 --> 29:43.983
No, it's not,

29:44.083 --> 29:45.717
but the conversations
he recorded

29:45.818 --> 29:47.319
with your client are.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.722
And he gave us more than enough
to put him away for life.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.193
What the hell?
You said we were in the clear!

29:54.293 --> 29:56.395
Not another word.

29:56.495 --> 29:57.729
Sit down.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.367
If I find out you knew
anything about this,

30:01.467 --> 30:05.737
I will personally see to it that
you're disbarred and prosecuted.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.554
What do you have
to say for yourself?

30:55.654 --> 30:57.957
I'm sorry, Panos.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.525
I-I messed up.
Tell me about it.

30:59.625 --> 31:00.626
It was a mistake.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.261
What was a mistake?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.731
I let Marco get away.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.333
And I killed an innocent woman.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.969
Shouldn't you be waiting
for me to say that?

31:10.069 --> 31:11.470
What are you talking about?

31:11.570 --> 31:12.604
Isn't that why
you're here?

31:13.505 --> 31:15.141
To get me to confess
to something on a little mic?

31:15.241 --> 31:17.209
Dude, what?
I wasn't born yesterday,

31:17.309 --> 31:18.210
you worthless idiot.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.845
Hey.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.481
Actually, we just needed
to get you down here

31:22.581 --> 31:23.682
so we could lock you up.

31:23.782 --> 31:25.284
For what?

31:25.384 --> 31:26.385
I didn't do it.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.220
That kid just said
he shot the woman.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.289
You should be
careful who you trust.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.259
That friend of yours,
that gave up his name

31:33.359 --> 31:34.860
on your orders?

31:34.961 --> 31:36.195
She flipped pretty quick.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.965
Katrina wouldn't do that.
That's the thing.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.367
I never mentioned her name.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.538
Hands behind your back.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.507
And she didn't.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.077
Katrina swore up and down
that she'd never even met you.
Damn it.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.112
Looks like you're
the worthless idiot.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.246
Let's go.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.317
Take him.
Yes, Sergeant.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.825
Captain Maher of
Fleet Services

32:06.925 --> 32:09.428
has requested a meeting
tomorrow at 10:00.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.562
Regarding what?

32:10.662 --> 32:11.697
He'd like to show you

32:11.797 --> 32:13.199
the new vehicles
he's rolling out.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.467
And Garrett wants to come
along to take some photos.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.668
Tell him I'm busy.

32:16.768 --> 32:17.936
But you're not.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.039
I know that,
but tell him I am anyway.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.242
He's very excited
to show them off.

32:25.811 --> 32:28.314
And Garrett thinks
it's a great idea.

32:30.516 --> 32:34.820
Well, then their excitement
will last till next week.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.993
But you're booked up next week.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.329
You have back-to-backs
every day.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.298
I do?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.801
Yes, sir, you do.

32:53.939 --> 32:55.707
Okay.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.278
Well, I guess we got
to do it tomorrow.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.250
00, you said?

33:04.350 --> 33:05.884
Yes, sir.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.287
And what time is the event

33:08.387 --> 33:10.589
at the New York College
for Criminal Justice?

33:10.689 --> 33:14.260
Not sure how that's related,
but it's at 10:30.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.396
So, here's the thing.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.632
I get in the car,
you and Garrett kidnap me,

33:20.732 --> 33:25.237
and, miraculously, we arrive
at the college just in time.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.307
Why would we do that?

33:32.911 --> 33:37.049
Because tomorrow
is a special day.

33:40.886 --> 33:42.388
Damn.

33:43.622 --> 33:44.656
Wasn't that hard, Abigail.

33:44.756 --> 33:45.691
How did you figure it out?

33:45.791 --> 33:46.925
Well, I remember

33:47.025 --> 33:50.562
it was a day
a lot like this one.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.564
Warm and dry for the month.

33:52.664 --> 33:56.068
What we used to call a gift
and now we call global warming.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.937
Don't be mad.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.473
Our hearts were
in the right place.

34:01.573 --> 34:02.708
And it's a good thing

34:02.808 --> 34:04.643
the college is
trying to make amends.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.347
Yeah, I know.

34:10.316 --> 34:12.818
If you want to call it off...

34:12.918 --> 34:14.486
Well, Abigail...

34:16.388 --> 34:17.623
I won't.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.592
Well, let me put it this way,
I shouldn't.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.929
But you hate surprises

34:24.029 --> 34:25.464
and you hate when
the attention is on you.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.234
Yeah, I know that
and you know that.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.502
But you all seem so committed

34:30.602 --> 34:33.605
to this clever little
scheme of yours.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.209
Bring it on.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.560
How'd it go
in there?

34:54.660 --> 34:56.262
Couldn't have done
it without your help.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.197
I didn't help,
I just got in the way.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.498
You were right.
Panos ordered that girl

34:59.598 --> 35:00.466
to give up
Elijah's name.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.134
Imagine that.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.003
I got it from here.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.539
Come on.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.478
Danny, gun!

35:15.481 --> 35:16.648
Let me go!

35:16.748 --> 35:18.184
Let me go,
damn it--

35:18.284 --> 35:19.518
Stay there.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.921
What are you thinking? Why?

35:23.021 --> 35:24.723
Because they told me
that you cut him a deal.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.225
I didn't cut him anything.
Yes, you did!

35:26.325 --> 35:27.393
He killed my wife!

35:27.493 --> 35:28.694
And now--

35:28.794 --> 35:29.861
Now he's going to get
away with it.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.997
No, he'll get what he deserves.

35:32.097 --> 35:32.964
No, he won't.

35:33.064 --> 35:34.600
Yeah, he will.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.702
And so will you, too.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.282
Come on, Elijah.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.796
How'd you know
I'd be here?

36:04.896 --> 36:06.865
Jamie told me
this was your spot.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.367
I didn't even know you played.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.735
You're looking at Suffolk
County Player of the Year,

36:09.835 --> 36:10.802
two years straight.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.939
Hmm, I wouldn't have guessed.

36:14.806 --> 36:15.807
Thanks?

36:15.907 --> 36:18.710
What are you doing here?
I, um,

36:18.810 --> 36:20.812
wanted to thank you.

36:20.912 --> 36:23.949
I wouldn't have gotten to
the bottom of this without you.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.851
Appreciate that.

36:25.951 --> 36:29.655
And I wanted to talk
about what you said.

36:29.755 --> 36:33.759
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry

36:33.859 --> 36:35.927
that I got caught up
in the heat of the moment.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.629
I shouldn't have
said those things.

36:37.729 --> 36:40.366
No, you shouldn't
have, but...

36:40.466 --> 36:42.401
you were right.

36:43.168 --> 36:46.272
It's a huge blemish
on my office and on me.

36:48.139 --> 36:49.775
I worked with
Davis for years

36:49.875 --> 36:52.644
and I, um, ignored
his drinking.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.546
He was a good ole boy

36:54.646 --> 36:56.548
and did his job,
never caused any problems.

36:56.648 --> 37:00.486
So I just looked
the other way.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.155
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you.

37:04.256 --> 37:05.957
About what?

37:06.057 --> 37:10.729
The way you conduct yourself,
particularly in my office.

37:11.863 --> 37:13.231
I already apologized.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.434
You can't behave that way.

37:15.534 --> 37:19.605
I already have Danny and Jamie
barging into my office,

37:19.705 --> 37:21.640
acting like they
own the place.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.808
But they're my brothers.

37:22.908 --> 37:23.875
You're not. Okay.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.110
You're my nephew. Okay.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.145
And you should
show some respect.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.014
Understood.

37:30.215 --> 37:31.650
I mean, I'm just
doing my job, though.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.719
I-I'm sorry if I get a
little heated sometimes.

37:33.819 --> 37:34.986
A lot heated.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.056
Well, that's just
who I am, so...

37:39.391 --> 37:43.094
Just don't forget that
your father was my brother.

37:43.194 --> 37:47.366
And he would be ashamed
of the way you spoke to me.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.107
You guys.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.126
Today, we honor
the distinguished career

38:48.226 --> 38:52.764
of perhaps the finest
of New York's Finest.

38:52.864 --> 38:56.502
Please welcome to the stage
Henry Reagan.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.814
The 42nd police commissioner
of the NYPD.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.357
Thank you.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.028
Trust me when I tell you

39:23.128 --> 39:27.198
that I am not at all worthy
of any high praise.

39:27.298 --> 39:31.036
The truth is, I'm just a cop.

39:32.404 --> 39:36.207
No different than
the many men and women in blue

39:36.307 --> 39:40.245
that you likely passed by
on your way here today.

39:43.915 --> 39:48.119
Today is indeed a special day.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.693
50 years ago today,

39:54.793 --> 39:56.862
Francis Xavier Reagan

39:56.962 --> 39:59.665
first walked the beat

39:59.765 --> 40:03.401
as a uniformed officer
of the NYPD.

40:04.269 --> 40:08.607
For him, being tapped
for Commissioner

40:08.707 --> 40:11.510
was no happenstance.

40:11.610 --> 40:15.413
It was nothing less
than the hand of God

40:15.514 --> 40:17.783
putting the right man

40:17.883 --> 40:21.152
in the right place
at the right time.

40:25.223 --> 40:29.327
I am proud to have sat
in the same chair as him.

40:30.696 --> 40:35.400
But I'm even more proud
to call him my son.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.205
Please welcome

40:40.305 --> 40:45.410
the longest-serving commissioner
in the history of the NYPD,

40:45.511 --> 40:48.614
Francis Xavier Reagan.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.626
Congratulations, boss.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.160
You guys.

41:28.954 --> 41:32.223
I brought you a
clam pie from Denino's.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.527
You went all the way
to Staten Island

41:35.627 --> 41:37.262
to get me my favorite pizza?

41:37.362 --> 41:40.331
I would have, but they actually
got a location in the Village.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.334
This your idea
of an apology?

41:45.771 --> 41:47.005
I just came to talk.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.108
We did talk, before,

41:50.208 --> 41:51.943
but you didn't listen.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.879
Look, I'm sorry.
You know, not for nothing,

41:53.979 --> 41:56.047
but you're not as smart
as you think you are.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.415
Just trying my best.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.784
I had no idea how
this was going to go down.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.285
No, you didn't.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.854
It's like chess.

42:02.954 --> 42:03.989
You know, you have
to see the whole board

42:04.089 --> 42:05.156
before you
make a move.

42:05.256 --> 42:06.758
Okay.
All right.

42:06.858 --> 42:07.926
You win.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.527
There's no winners here.

42:10.395 --> 42:11.697
Andre Lopez is locked up.

42:11.797 --> 42:14.566
And now his two kids
don't have either parent.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.102
Danny, you can't
put all that on me.

42:19.270 --> 42:20.305
Huh.
