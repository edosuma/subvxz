19:52.278 --> 19:53.496
You are not Salafi.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.498
Shaving is not haram.

19:55.542 --> 19:56.586
It pleases Muhammad.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.849
It's my faith, my strength.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.852
It'll be your death
if someone recognizes you.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.941
They're looking for a man
with a beard.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.682
So what pleases Muhammad most?

20:05.726 --> 20:07.858
Your beard or your life?

20:14.648 --> 20:15.866
DELILAH:
Hey.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.346
Need any help?

20:17.390 --> 20:18.869
I'm good.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.436
You sure?

20:20.480 --> 20:23.091
Okay, spill it.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.746
Okay. I know
that was your portrait.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.704
[exhales]It was your style,

20:27.748 --> 20:29.663
your signature.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.361
So why'd you say it wasn't?

20:35.190 --> 20:38.454
This is a story
I only want to tell once.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.805
[exhales]

20:43.111 --> 20:45.069
The woman in that portrait

20:45.113 --> 20:46.636
was a friend from college.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.203
Actually...

20:49.291 --> 20:51.075
...she was more than a friend.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.557
So what happened?

20:55.602 --> 20:58.300
Eventually, school ended and...

20:58.344 --> 21:00.084
we went our separa ways.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.478
We just
thought that

21:02.522 --> 21:06.003
it wasn't something that could
survive the real world,

21:06.047 --> 21:08.092
as the world was then.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.705
Tricia went on to marry.

21:11.748 --> 21:12.923
A man.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.838
I haven't seen
her since.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.753
Story over.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.016
No, no,
because who was that woman

21:19.060 --> 21:20.279
who showed up this morning?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.628
Based on the resemblance?

21:21.671 --> 21:23.978
I'd say it was
Tricia's daughter.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.459
You think her mom
sent her to find you?

21:27.721 --> 21:29.157
Maybe there's a reason.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.550
Dee, don't try to make this

21:30.593 --> 21:31.768
into something that it isn't.

21:31.812 --> 21:32.987
For better or for worse,

21:33.030 --> 21:34.205
I put all of this

21:34.249 --> 21:36.643
behind me a long time ago.

21:36.686 --> 21:38.427
Still,

21:38.471 --> 21:40.690
aren't you even a little curious
to find out what she's like now?

21:41.735 --> 21:43.519
What's the harm?

21:48.655 --> 21:50.787
Okay, I think we're set.
You want us to wait?

21:50.831 --> 21:53.703
I'm 30 minutes out.
We're running out of time.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.009
You sure you want to do this?

21:55.052 --> 21:57.141
No.
[clears throat]

21:57.185 --> 21:59.230
But I'm gonna do it anyway.

21:59.274 --> 22:02.059
Okay. Starting the timer now.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.975
I'm in.

22:05.019 --> 22:07.151
Locating the database.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.805
Running the print.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.640
We got a hit.

22:17.684 --> 22:19.163
BISHOP:
Who?

22:19.207 --> 22:20.164
Hadid Bashir. Do you know him?

22:20.208 --> 22:21.470
Ex-foreign intelligence.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.906
Worked closely with the CIA

22:22.950 --> 22:24.473
until he had a beef about money.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.040
Went independent
about five years ago.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.911
Always works
for the highest bidder.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.217
So Talib hed him to grab Zade?

22:29.260 --> 22:30.914
Where is he keeping him?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.568
One minute, 30. Harry,
you got to get out of there.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.396
All right, now, wait,
Harry, generate a list

22:34.440 --> 22:37.530
of decommissioned
CIA safe houses in the area.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.183
Anything over five years old.

22:39.227 --> 22:42.012
Bashir would know
about those properties.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.187
One minute, 54. Harry?

22:43.231 --> 22:45.364
Okay, I got three. Now can I...?

22:45.407 --> 22:46.756
Go, go. Get out of there.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.196
[exhales, clears throat]

22:52.240 --> 22:54.024
Harry, is there any way
we can get a live feed

22:54.068 --> 22:55.199
of those addresses?

22:55.243 --> 22:56.505
No problem.

22:59.247 --> 23:02.076
Okay. I got street cams
on all three.

23:02.119 --> 23:04.731
That green van is parked down
the street from one of them.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.080
That's where
they're holding him.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.473
If it's a safe house,
it's a fortress.

23:07.516 --> 23:08.778
How are you gonna get in?

23:08.822 --> 23:10.258
Every safe house
has a back way out,

23:10.301 --> 23:11.955
in case it gets breached.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.697
That's how I'm going in.
Send me the address.

23:15.655 --> 23:16.873
You know what, Bishop?

23:16.917 --> 23:18.701
A "please" would be nice.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.312
Please?

23:21.356 --> 23:23.271
Sure.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.192
You should have killed them.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.455
For helping you?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.326
They're planning to alert
the authorities.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.937
By the time they get out
of those restraints,

23:36.980 --> 23:38.721
you'll be long gone.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.549
Enough innocent people
have died because of you.

23:40.593 --> 23:42.333
I'm not adding to that number.

23:42.377 --> 23:44.074
Despite what your
government and media

23:44.118 --> 23:47.295
would have you believe,
I do not kill innocent people.

23:47.338 --> 23:50.080
They were casualties
of a war we did not start.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.169
But because
I look different,

23:52.213 --> 23:54.433
because my skin is different,

23:54.476 --> 23:56.652
because my faith
is different,

23:56.696 --> 23:59.089
I am the terrorist.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.571
Put that gun under the seat.

24:02.615 --> 24:03.920
There's a
checkpoint ahead.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.444
They're going
car by car.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.317
Do you want to get caught?

24:11.972 --> 24:14.278
Don't do anything stupid.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.282
If I was gonna do that,
you'd be dead already.

24:18.326 --> 24:20.328
[indistinct chatter]

24:20.371 --> 24:22.417
OFFICER:
Stop right there, please.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.162
License and registration.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.816
Of course, Officer.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.600
[indistinct radio chatter]

24:37.040 --> 24:38.651
Unlock your tailgate, please.

24:38.694 --> 24:39.608
Sure.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.055
[tailgate closes]

24:54.667 --> 24:56.016
Have a good evening.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.931
Thank you, Officer.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.196
Don't get cocky.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.415
There'll be FBI at the airport.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.766
And they'll be looking
much closer.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.812
[lock clicking]

25:18.081 --> 25:20.127
[man speaking
foreign language nearby]

25:46.632 --> 25:48.547
[turbines whirring]

25:52.899 --> 25:54.117
ROBYN:
We're here.

25:56.076 --> 25:58.339
Bishop's reputation
is well-deserved.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.864
It's a private flight,

26:01.908 --> 26:03.605
so no metal detectors.

26:03.649 --> 26:06.434
But let me do the talking
with passport control, okay?

26:06.477 --> 26:09.306
The last thing we need
is your accent raising flags.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.396
My passport?

26:15.356 --> 26:17.663
What's the second one for?

26:17.706 --> 26:20.056
I was hired to deliver you
to Cuba.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.058
That's exactly what
I'm going to do.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.235
You want to go by yourself?

26:25.279 --> 26:26.628
Fine.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.064
But I don't
know this pilot,

26:28.108 --> 26:29.892
nor his intentions.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.591
Okay, you'll come.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.505
But I'll take your gun.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.117
You'll just have to trust me.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.344
Wow.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.608
Lot of security tonight.
Something up?

26:49.651 --> 26:51.087
I need to see
your passports, please.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.658
What was the purpose of
your visit to the United States?

26:56.702 --> 26:57.964
Business.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.139
Mr. Machado here was part

26:59.182 --> 27:00.314
of a special envoy to the U.N.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.445
from Cuba.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.838
I'm Maxine Holt

27:02.882 --> 27:04.318
from the State Department,
his escort.

27:04.361 --> 27:06.712
[trilling, beeps]

27:08.583 --> 27:10.280
Mr. Machado,
what kind of work do you do?

27:10.324 --> 27:12.021
Mr. Machado is a specialist

27:12.065 --> 27:13.675
in global warming.I'm asking him.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.851
Well, he doesn't speak English.
I'm sorry.

27:15.895 --> 27:18.288
In Cuba?
Everyone speaks English.

27:20.508 --> 27:23.293
In Havana, maybe.

27:23.337 --> 27:26.035
But Mr. Machado here
is from Viñales.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.341
You ever been?

27:45.359 --> 27:46.839
Checks out.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.797
Says Manhattan will be
underwater in ten years.

27:48.841 --> 27:50.146
[laughs softly]

27:53.889 --> 27:55.804
[trilling]

27:55.848 --> 27:59.329
[trilling continues]

28:05.509 --> 28:07.120
[beeps]

28:08.077 --> 28:09.383
You're all set.
Have a safe flight.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.472
Thank you.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.258
How did you know I was fluent?

28:15.302 --> 28:17.521
Four years in Madrid,
I figured you could get by.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.872
[high-pitched ringing]

28:19.915 --> 28:22.875
ZADE:
Hey. Hey.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.094
Good. You're not dead.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.139
Zade?

28:26.182 --> 28:27.357
You know my name?

28:27.401 --> 28:29.577
Who are you?

28:29.620 --> 28:31.013
I'm an intelligence operative.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.449
I'm gonna get you out of here.

28:32.493 --> 28:34.147
How's that working out for you?

28:35.148 --> 28:36.453
Actually,

28:36.497 --> 28:38.194
I got caught on purpose.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.589
Easier to find you that way.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.809
Who sent you?

28:43.852 --> 28:46.028
Why did those guys grab me?

28:46.072 --> 28:47.769
I know you got a lot
of questions,

28:47.813 --> 28:50.641
but we're on a clock,
and we're running out of time.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.121
First thing I got to do,

28:52.165 --> 28:54.080
is find out how many guys
we're dealing with.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.559
There's seven.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.779
The three who grabbed me,
four other voices.

28:57.823 --> 29:01.435
Three of them speak Arabic,
one speaks Pashto.

29:01.478 --> 29:04.568
Oh, every hour, one of them
opens up the door

29:04.612 --> 29:05.961
to check up on me.

29:06.005 --> 29:08.224
Pretty impressive.

29:08.268 --> 29:09.704
Where'd you learn to do that?

29:09.748 --> 29:12.272
My mother. She always said
we had to be on guard.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.795
She never said why.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.579
I guess today I found out.

29:15.623 --> 29:16.842
What's your name?

29:19.366 --> 29:22.848
Bishop. You can call me Bishop.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.939
Hmm.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.897
Your mom teach you
how to fight, too?

29:28.941 --> 29:30.551
I can handle myself.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.596
Yeah?

29:32.640 --> 29:33.815
Good, 'cause next time

29:33.859 --> 29:35.034
these guys come to check on us,

29:35.077 --> 29:36.252
we're gonna take them out.

29:37.253 --> 29:38.733
With what, exactly?

29:38.777 --> 29:39.908
We don't have weapons.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.476
Sure we do.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.783
They're just keeping
them warm for us.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.307
[laughs softly]
Uh, I don't know

29:47.350 --> 29:48.699
if you've noticed,
but we're duct-taped.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.310
I've already checked.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.355
There's nothing sharp enough
to cut through the tape.

29:54.967 --> 29:56.620
Yes, there is.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.628
[Talib speaks foreign language]

30:04.672 --> 30:06.108
[sighs]

30:08.328 --> 30:09.677
Tell me,

30:09.720 --> 30:11.157
when were you
intending to kill me?

30:11.200 --> 30:13.289
No more need to lie.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.813
We have Bishop.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.178
On the contrary,

30:32.221 --> 30:34.963
most agreements
are made

30:35.007 --> 30:37.052
with a gun to someone's head.

30:37.096 --> 30:39.359
You just
haven't noticed,

30:39.402 --> 30:42.623
because for a hundred years,
the West have held the gun.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.671
I studied to be an architect

30:47.715 --> 30:50.239
because I wanted
to build a future.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.893
I was naive.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.155
When bombs fall

30:53.199 --> 30:56.593
on our buildings--
American bombs--

30:56.637 --> 30:59.683
killing my parents, my family...

31:01.642 --> 31:04.036
...what kind of future
can we have?

31:04.079 --> 31:06.168
I am no longer naive.

31:06.212 --> 31:10.738
What happened to your family
was wrong.

31:10.781 --> 31:13.567
But it doesn't make
what you do right.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.917
No.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.050
But it makes it necessary.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.529
[scoffs]

31:19.573 --> 31:21.923
That's funny.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.360
That's just what Americans say.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.710
Don't worry.

31:26.754 --> 31:29.800
I'll free the son as promised.

31:29.844 --> 31:31.585
And Bishop?
