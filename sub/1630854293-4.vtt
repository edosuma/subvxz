WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.220
Previously onSWAT...You're a prosecutor, huh?

00:03.264 --> 00:04.395
Deputy D.A.Wow, that's a tough gig.

00:04.439 --> 00:06.484
Says the brother in blue.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.182
Nia Wells. Daniel Harrelson.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.879
Maybe we should...Take a break.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.489
But I should probably mention,
I'm seeing someone.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.925
Look at you,
getting domestic.

00:12.969 --> 00:15.058
Ex-girlfriend?I wouldn't go that far.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.973
NICHELLE:
Our program,
which we're calling COPE,

00:17.017 --> 00:19.106
911 dispatch will only forward

00:19.149 --> 00:21.108
nonviolent calls
to the hotline.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.631
When someone has
a mental health episode,

00:22.674 --> 00:23.588
sometimes the last person
they want to talk to

00:23.632 --> 00:25.547
is a uniformed officer.

00:25.590 --> 00:26.852
Let's have a kid together.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.941
I want to have
a family with you.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.117
I want the same thing.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.554
[yelps]

00:32.597 --> 00:33.729
We're-we're having a girl.

00:33.772 --> 00:34.860
LUCA:
Hell yeah, Hondo!

00:34.904 --> 00:36.775
#GirlDad!

00:36.819 --> 00:39.952
Oh, this is crazy.
This is so crazy.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.480
â™ª

00:47.438 --> 00:48.700
HONDO:
Morning, Sheriff.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.267
How was your drive out
from Correctional?

00:50.311 --> 00:51.877
Extra bumpy.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.792
Hope he has
a strong stomach.

00:53.836 --> 00:56.186
You think we'll get out of
here before the media hears

00:56.230 --> 00:58.232
Roman's out of prison
on a field trip?

00:58.275 --> 01:00.147
It's been a few years
since the trial.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.713
You think they still care?

01:01.757 --> 01:04.238
DOYLE:
Roman's trial was
their bread and butter.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.849
Find out he's leading us
to a body, they'll be here.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.677
Trust me.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.552
[grunts]

01:14.596 --> 01:16.293
Alexei Roman.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.122
Sadistic S.O.B.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.384
What's he getting in exchange
for turning over the body?

01:20.428 --> 01:21.820
Transfer upstate.

01:21.864 --> 01:24.606
Apparently,
he's sick of the sunshine.

01:26.303 --> 01:27.826
Who are the men in black?

01:27.870 --> 01:29.132
Why don't you just
concentrate on leading us

01:29.176 --> 01:30.438
to the remains, Roman?

01:30.481 --> 01:33.136
Come here,
let me see that rifle.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.007
Not on your life, pal.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.008
Oh, heads up.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.793
Got a lookie-loo.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.144
Oh, no, that's the, uh,
wife of the deceased, Odette.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.667
Kind of surprised
she'd want to be here.

01:42.711 --> 01:45.279
I can't imagine there's
much left of her husband

01:45.322 --> 01:46.758
other than bones.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.934
She's probably just
looking for closure.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.154
NIA:
If it isn't the brother in blue.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.157
Give me a second.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.332
Nia.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.377
Wow, it's been
a long time.

01:56.420 --> 01:57.682
It's good to see you, Hondo.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.423
Yeah, it's good
to see you.

01:59.467 --> 02:00.555
I didn't realize the D.A.'s
office was still involved.

02:00.598 --> 02:01.686
Oh, we're not,
thank God.

02:01.730 --> 02:02.818
The prosecution finally rests.

02:02.861 --> 02:05.168
I'm here as, um, moral support.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.865
The victim's wife and I
grew close

02:06.909 --> 02:08.476
during the trial.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.042
She had nowhere to turn,
we become good friends.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.480
I promised
I'd sit in the car with her

02:12.523 --> 02:13.698
while the remains are recovered.

02:13.742 --> 02:15.091
How's everything else
with you?

02:15.135 --> 02:18.138
Good.
Uh, job's good.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.314
Eric and I tried
to make it work again.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.402
Failed again.

02:21.445 --> 02:22.838
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.754
Are you, though?
I have a confession.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.538
I asked the warden
to include Sergeant Harrelson

02:27.582 --> 02:29.236
in his request
for a SWAT escort.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.020
[chuckles]:
I had dinner

02:31.063 --> 02:33.196
at The Carlton last week.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.589
Okay, look, Nia...I hadn't been there

02:34.632 --> 02:36.199
since we stayed
during the heat wave.

02:36.243 --> 02:39.811
I got to thinking,
we should, um, get together.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.857
I'm in a committed relationship
now, Nia.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.381
In a happy one.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.340
My girlfriend's expecting,
actually.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.690
Wow. [chuckles] I...

02:48.733 --> 02:51.388
I'm speechless
and a little embarrassed.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.216
Don't worry about it.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.870
I'm happy for you, Hondo.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.089
Thank you.
We're excited.

02:57.133 --> 03:00.441
Settling down,
becoming a father.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.007
Finally convinced yourself

03:02.051 --> 03:03.313
it's something that you want.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.488
Good for you.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.576
STREET:Hondo.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.665
Ready to go.

03:07.709 --> 03:08.840
Excuse me.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.102
Congrats again.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.593
HICKS:
I mean,
the whole scene was chaos.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.204
Fire truck arrives,

03:24.247 --> 03:26.467
the gazebo lit up
like a Christmas tree.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.643
[scoffs]Father-to-be's trying
to fight the flames

03:28.686 --> 03:30.384
with a garden hose.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.647
Aunts and uncles are
running for their lives.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.736
I'm just saying,

03:34.779 --> 03:37.304
you and Hondo got off easy
with a low-key gender reveal.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.219
Ooh, crisis averted.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.569
I got to admit, Commander,
the suspense has been killing me

03:41.612 --> 03:44.093
since I got word
you wanted to talk.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.834
I tried getting Hondo
to spill the beans,

03:45.877 --> 03:47.009
but he was out the door

03:47.052 --> 03:48.097
so early...

03:48.140 --> 03:49.751
Hondo doesn't know about this.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.970
LAPD got
a new inspector general.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.537
This is a draft copy of

03:53.581 --> 03:55.800
her recommendations
to the police commission.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.759
Check out page 11,
I earmarked it.

03:58.890 --> 04:01.153
This is about
the COPE program.Yeah.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.462
"Fielding ten percent
of low-risk 911 calls,

04:05.506 --> 04:09.031
"civilian volunteers reduced
the burden on police.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.773
We recommend COPE be
fully funded by the city."

04:11.816 --> 04:13.644
[gasps] I can't believe it.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.517
Full funding?Yeah, get
to the final paragraph.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.520
They want to fold COPE
under the LAPD's umbrella?

04:19.563 --> 04:20.608
It's a successful program.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.174
They want to make it official.

04:22.218 --> 04:23.175
Sir, the whole point

04:23.219 --> 04:24.568
of the program

04:24.612 --> 04:26.353
is to send
someone other than police

04:26.396 --> 04:27.615
to people who are unwell

04:27.658 --> 04:29.878
and might lash out
at authority.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.358
I mean,
if the LAPD takes over COPE,

04:31.401 --> 04:32.794
half my volunteers will walk.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.144
Read the fine print.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.667
If you turn down
the funding,

04:36.711 --> 04:39.540
they'll cut off your access
to 911 dispatch.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.150
So, what?
It's a hostile takeover?

04:41.193 --> 04:42.978
But I.G. oversees
the police,

04:43.021 --> 04:44.632
not the other way around.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.851
I mean, you've poured
your blood, sweat and tears

04:46.895 --> 04:48.505
into COPE, Nichelle.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.072
I just thought
you deserved to know.

04:50.115 --> 04:52.074
I appreciate that.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.381
Yeah, I'm sorry.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.166
The new inspector general,

04:57.209 --> 04:59.168
where could I find her office?

05:02.519 --> 05:04.173
STREET:
Hey, uh, the woman
who pulled you aside earlier,

05:04.216 --> 05:06.393
I've seen her somewhere before.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.830
Yeah, Nia Wells.
She's an assistant D.A.

05:08.873 --> 05:11.354
Right, right.
I thought I recognized her.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.052
Seems like
you know each other well.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.837
We used to.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.274
Here.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.450
Think that's the burial site?

05:21.451 --> 05:22.844
Looks like it.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.890
How did Roman manage
to drag a body

05:25.934 --> 05:28.937
all the way up here by himself?

05:28.980 --> 05:30.939
Adrenaline, I guess.

05:30.982 --> 05:33.115
But, terrain like this,
I can't imagine

05:33.158 --> 05:35.204
he was able to
bury the body very deep.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.597
Any chance he's full of it?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.990
[scoffs] It wouldn't be
the first time

05:39.034 --> 05:40.992
a killer's taken cops
on a wild goose chase.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.994
And it's pretty wide-open
here to hide a body.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.692
Hey, Sheriff.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.650
What do you got, Sergeant?

05:46.694 --> 05:48.130
What are the odds this guy's
just messing with us,

05:48.173 --> 05:49.523
getting his kicks?Well, if that's the case,

05:49.566 --> 05:51.873
he can kiss his transfer
to NorCal goodbye.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.657
[helicopter approaching]

05:55.398 --> 05:56.747
Damn, looks like
the news found us.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.749
My money's on Channel 5.

05:58.793 --> 05:59.794
I hear it, but I don't see it.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.056
It's moving fast.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.318
Where the hell is it?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.015
It's trying to stay undetected.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.495
It's not coming from above,
it's coming from below.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.932
Sheriff, that's not
a news chopper!

06:07.976 --> 06:09.064
Take cover!

06:12.372 --> 06:13.677
OFFICER:
Get down!

06:15.070 --> 06:17.986
STREET:
Everybody, go! Move, move!
Get down!

06:20.902 --> 06:21.946
Sheriff needs help!

06:21.990 --> 06:22.947
[grunting][gunfire]

06:22.991 --> 06:23.948
That's our window!

06:23.992 --> 06:25.080
Move in, move in!

06:29.171 --> 06:30.390
[groans]

06:33.131 --> 06:34.394
Go, go, go, go!

06:38.223 --> 06:40.312
Hey! You all right?Yeah.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.838
Son of a bitch.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.796
â™ª

07:20.483 --> 07:22.354
Hondo and Street are
almost back. What do we got?

07:22.398 --> 07:24.487
The chopper was found
abandoned in Sylmar.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.793
Rancher witnessed
the prisoner and two men

07:25.836 --> 07:27.272
speed off in a truck.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.491
Didn't get any plates.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.666
We're tracking
the chopper's origin.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.363
Who escapes
with this kind of help?

07:31.407 --> 07:33.061
Alexei Roman.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.324
Emigrated from Russia
after being expelled

07:35.367 --> 07:37.761
from the army
for assaulting a recruit.

07:37.805 --> 07:40.198
He owned a seedy nightclub
in East Hollywood,

07:40.242 --> 07:42.505
became a popular
underworld spot.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.289
He also ran a burglary ring
on the side.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.117
He had his own version
of the American dream,

07:46.161 --> 07:47.902
until he killed his driver,

07:47.945 --> 07:49.773
a man named Lee Cobb.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.122
And then there was
Roman's trial,

07:51.166 --> 07:52.472
which was as sensational
as they come.

07:52.515 --> 07:53.473
Every day
some waitress or bouncer

07:53.516 --> 07:55.518
testified to Roman's abuse

07:55.562 --> 07:57.259
of his workers--
I mean, twisted punishments.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.217
I mean, some he branded
like cattle

07:59.261 --> 08:00.741
from a brand he got in the army.

08:00.784 --> 08:01.829
How'd he end up
getting convicted of murder

08:01.872 --> 08:03.308
without a body?

08:03.352 --> 08:04.745
Well, his driver was working
as an informant.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.442
He was wearing a wire

08:06.486 --> 08:08.357
at the time
Roman strangled him to death.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.750
After hearing the tape,
the jury took about an hour

08:09.793 --> 08:11.142
to convict him.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.883
I doubt
they'll find the body now.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.232
Hey, three armed men
just ransacked

08:14.276 --> 08:15.320
a day spa in East Hollywood.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.279
Stole a laptop,

08:17.322 --> 08:18.759
interrogated the owner
and beat him into a coma.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.108
They spoke Russian.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.544
One matched Roman's description.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.503
We get an address?4103 Wilton Court,

08:23.546 --> 08:24.591
but they're long gone, man.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.158
4103 Wilton. Wait.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.551
That-That's building
that housed his nightclub.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.161
The spa owner
purchased the property

08:30.205 --> 08:31.728
two months ago at auction.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.295
Retribution?

08:33.338 --> 08:34.862
I mean,
this guy buys Roman's nightclub

08:34.905 --> 08:36.777
after he's locked up, so
Roman beats him half to death?

08:36.820 --> 08:38.256
Maybe, but it sounds

08:38.300 --> 08:39.780
like Roman was looking
for someone else.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.303
Witnesses heard
the owner getting tortured.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.871
Roman was asking about
a guy named Andrew.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.350
Someone who used
to work for Roman?

08:45.394 --> 08:46.917
Well, whoever it is,
that's Roman's next target.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.223
I want
every ex-employee we can find

08:48.266 --> 08:49.572
brought in for their protection.

08:49.616 --> 08:50.878
Get me an ID
on this Andrew.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.967
Roman's out for blood.
Let's get moving.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.057
[groans]

08:58.973 --> 09:00.061
Hey.
Hey.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.890
Heard you saw some
serious action this morning.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.110
One minute
it's a funeral procession,

09:06.154 --> 09:09.113
next thing you know...
Apocalypse Now.

09:09.157 --> 09:12.639
Hey, you remember Miguel Alfaro,
Long Beach SWAT.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.031
Alfaro was just
filling me in

09:14.075 --> 09:15.859
on some of
your LBPD war stories.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.774
Only the good ones, Streeter.
Promise.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.428
Alfaro.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.038
What, uh, what are you doing
in L.A.?

09:21.082 --> 09:23.040
I lateraled into the LAPD
last year,

09:23.084 --> 09:24.607
hoping to transfer onto SWAT.

09:24.651 --> 09:25.869
Finally got called up
to the show.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.610
50-Squad's new three-plus-one.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.004
The open slot on Rocker's team.
So, you got the job?

09:30.047 --> 09:31.571
Yeah,
today's my first day.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.921
From Long Beach SWAT to L.A.,
just like you.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.183
Yeah, I know
the higher-ups wouldn't

09:35.226 --> 09:36.271
have given me a second look

09:36.314 --> 09:37.925
if you hadn't vouched for me.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.579
I appreciate you, Streeter.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.805
You don't like
that guy, do you?

09:48.849 --> 09:50.459
Guessing it's more than
him calling you Streeter.

09:50.502 --> 09:51.939
We just, um,

09:51.982 --> 09:54.028
rubbed each other the wrong way
back then.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.464
Well, it's been a few years.
People mature.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.639
Maybe he's changed.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.253
How long did you work at
Roman's nightclub, Ms. Morgan?

10:02.297 --> 10:03.907
Uh, Amber's fine.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.257
I worked there two years.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.650
Started off tending bar,

10:07.694 --> 10:09.957
Roman made me manager
after a while.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.699
Um, I saw a few cars that
I recognized out in the lot.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.789
How many guys from the old club
are you bringing in?

10:15.832 --> 10:17.181
With your ex-boss on the loose,
trying to talk

10:17.225 --> 10:18.748
to everyone we can.Well, knowing Roman,

10:18.792 --> 10:20.141
he's probably already
halfway back to Russia.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.664
LUCA:
Yeah, unfortunately,

10:21.708 --> 10:23.274
it seems he has
unfinished business here in L.A.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.059
In your days at the club,

10:25.102 --> 10:26.843
did you ever run across
a guy named Andrew?
No.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.715
I don't remember
anybody with that name.

10:28.758 --> 10:29.933
How'd you and Roman get along?

10:29.977 --> 10:31.369
[scoffs]

10:31.413 --> 10:32.893
You ever have
a boss steal from you?

10:32.936 --> 10:34.677
Threaten to choke you out?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.461
Yeah, he almost finished the job
once, too.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.681
One night,

10:38.725 --> 10:40.422
I was doing the books,

10:40.465 --> 10:44.078
and I saw that money wasn't
making it to the bank.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.167
He was stealing from the club.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.909
So you confronted him?Hell no.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.562
I played dumb.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.652
Just pretended
that I messed up the math.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.872
But he saw right through that,
though.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.614
He pinned me to the wall

10:58.658 --> 11:00.529
and, uh,
squeezed my throat

11:00.572 --> 11:05.186
with one hand
and my mouth with the other.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.886
Can you think of
any friends or family

11:09.930 --> 11:11.888
Roman might've kept
in touch with on the outside?

11:11.932 --> 11:13.324
Roman's got no family.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.065
No friends either.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.025
Listen, you don't know
what you're up against.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.504
Believe me.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.855
That man's got the devil
inside him.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.339
Commander.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.602
It was a hell of a morning.
How you feeling?

11:30.646 --> 11:32.953
Uh, I've been better.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.694
It's not every day
a killer convict

11:34.737 --> 11:36.391
escapes out
from under you.

11:36.434 --> 11:37.566
Hey, uh,

11:37.609 --> 11:38.915
I was surprised to hear

11:38.959 --> 11:41.091
Miguel Alfaro got
50-Squad's open slot.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.745
Guess I just,
I don't know,

11:42.789 --> 11:44.486
I figured my letter might've
been taken into account.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.357
Oh, it was,

11:46.401 --> 11:48.142
but I had to weigh it against
everything else I was hearing.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.578
Alfaro's commander said

11:49.621 --> 11:52.146
he was a standout
at Long Beach SWAT.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.974
Scores were off the charts,
I called around.

11:54.017 --> 11:56.324
People who'd worked with him
had phenomenal things to say.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.978
That's 'cause he knows
whose egos to stroke.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.283
It's all in my letter.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.024
I read your letter, Street.

12:01.068 --> 12:04.245
It mostly just read
like bad blood.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.857
Now, I don't approve
transfers often.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.120
Uh, as a matter of fact,
the last one

12:10.164 --> 12:11.905
I signed off on was yours.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.950
Alfaro's a special case,

12:13.994 --> 12:15.169
just like you were.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.258
So, the beef you have with him,

12:17.301 --> 12:18.650
you need to shake it off.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.565
He's not a good fit,
Commander.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.919
All due respect...

12:25.962 --> 12:27.659
I decide who's a good fit.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.226
Is working with Alfaro

12:29.270 --> 12:31.446
gonna be a problem
for you, Street?

12:37.713 --> 12:40.150
Hey, listen to this.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.544
An MH-6 Little Bird Helicopter
was reported stolen

12:42.587 --> 12:44.111
two days ago from an airfield
in Oregon.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.199
We get a bead
on the culprits?

12:45.242 --> 12:46.374
Better. We got IDs.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.549
Portland PD sent over

12:47.592 --> 12:48.680
the airfield security tape.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.034
Meet the lunatics
who shot us up.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.078
Traveled over from Moscow
last week.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.341
Expelled Russian soldiers.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.865
They served with Roman's unit.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.868
So, the laptop
that Roman stole from the spa

13:01.911 --> 13:03.783
was uploaded to a drive.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.002
Forensics found
no evidence of any Andrew.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.656
So, why tear apart the spa?

13:07.699 --> 13:09.789
You said the spa just renovated
a couple months back.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.965
What happened to Roman's stuff
from the nightclub?

13:12.008 --> 13:13.488
His possessions were seized
as state's evidence

13:13.531 --> 13:15.664
after his arrest.Wait, hold on.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.622
Not all of them.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.276
Last month
the spa owner off-loaded

13:19.320 --> 13:21.061
a bunch of Roman's old furniture
to a couple of pawnshops

13:21.104 --> 13:22.976
in Little Moscow.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.282
Maybe he left something behind
he needed to track Andrew down.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.936
I'll send a couple
of our guys over there,

13:26.980 --> 13:28.677
see if we can start
tracking down Roman's things.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.896
Send Tan and Cabrera.
Maybe there's an employee file

13:29.939 --> 13:31.680
Roman tucked away somewhere.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.203
We got to find Andrew
before he does.Roger that.

13:34.726 --> 13:37.381
Odette's making
her statement soon.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.253
Today was a big
setback for her.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.863
I'm gonna get
her home after.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.038
She's got to be devastated.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.561
Protective detail
will escort you

13:43.605 --> 13:45.346
whenever you're ready.Appreciate that. Thanks.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.390
Hey, Nia.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.218
Yeah?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.134
What you said earlier...

13:51.178 --> 13:52.440
I never would've made
a pass at you

13:52.483 --> 13:53.833
if I knew you were involved.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.356
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not about that.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.532
You said that
I finally convinced myself

13:57.575 --> 13:58.925
that I was ready
to be a father.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.840
What'd you mean by that?

14:00.883 --> 14:02.102
I mean, that's a strange thing
to say when someone tells you

14:02.145 --> 14:03.712
that there's a baby on the way.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.801
I can't believe that
came out of my mouth. I...

14:05.845 --> 14:07.890
I guess I was feeling awkward,

14:07.934 --> 14:09.805
but I never should have
brought it up.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.154
Brought what up?

14:11.198 --> 14:13.243
What you said to me once.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.028
The weekend we drove
up the coast,

14:15.071 --> 14:16.856
when we got to talking about
our families and our childhoods.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.640
What did I say?

14:19.684 --> 14:21.599
Go ahead, lay it on me.
What'd I say?

14:21.643 --> 14:23.732
That you were still
carrying a lot of baggage

14:23.775 --> 14:24.994
from when you were a kid,

14:25.038 --> 14:26.474
and it was a good thing
you didn't have

14:26.517 --> 14:27.910
any of your own.
You'd never want to

14:27.954 --> 14:29.346
mess them up in the head

14:29.390 --> 14:31.044
like your dad did
to you and your sister.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.697
But...

14:32.741 --> 14:34.395
I probably have it
so out of context.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.571
No.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.399
I said what I said.

14:38.442 --> 14:39.922
Forget I mentioned it.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.271
Forget you ever met me
while you're at it.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.578
Nia, Nia, Nia, Nia, Nia,
d-don't do that.

14:43.621 --> 14:46.015
I'm the one who asked.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.364
Don't sweat it. We're good.

14:47.408 --> 14:48.931
You sure?Yeah.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.498
I promise.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.115
CABRERA:
Barstools.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.378
Couches.

15:01.422 --> 15:04.120
The next place has Roman's stuff
in different sections.

15:04.164 --> 15:05.382
Want to split up the search?

15:05.426 --> 15:06.644
Yeah. Good call.

15:06.688 --> 15:07.689
How many pawnshops
do we have left?

15:07.732 --> 15:09.125
Two down, three to go.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.562
DISPATCHER:
All units, gunfire reported

15:11.606 --> 15:12.912
at 904 Western Place.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.696
First unit on scene,
please advise.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.003
That's one of the spots
on our list.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.657
25-David, we're two minutes out.
Send backup.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.921
[siren wailing][engine revs]

15:25.881 --> 15:28.536
[men speaking Russian]

15:28.579 --> 15:29.972
They're speaking Russian.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.800
You got eyes on Roman?I can't tell.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.367
Two armed suspects and two
civilians caught in the middle.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.585
Those people are
stuck in there.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.284
[woman screams]

15:37.327 --> 15:39.416
Gunfire inside.
Repeat, gunfire inside.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.678
Making entry.

15:41.941 --> 15:42.985
[speaks Russian]

15:43.029 --> 15:44.204
LAPD! Drop your guns!

15:44.247 --> 15:45.683
Put down your weapons!

15:45.727 --> 15:47.163
TAN:
Hands above your head
right now!

15:50.862 --> 15:52.212
That's Roman's brand
from the army.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.735
Get 'em up!Moving in.

15:54.910 --> 15:55.998
TAN:
My guy is running!

15:59.915 --> 16:01.612
Give me your hands!

16:01.656 --> 16:04.224
I've been shot.
Let me go.

16:04.267 --> 16:05.225
Where's Roman?

16:05.268 --> 16:06.835
Screw you.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.576
We know he's after Andrew.
Tell us how to find him.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.012
Who is Andrew?
Get off me.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.971
Where was Roman headed?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.320
[grunts] She took all of it.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.321
She took everything from him.

16:14.364 --> 16:15.757
Who did?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.063
His daughter.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.065
That stupid bitch.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.980
Roman has a daughter?

16:21.023 --> 16:22.546
What's her name? Huh?
Where is she?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.287
Go to hell!

16:24.331 --> 16:26.028
I hope he kills her.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.862
Sir, when they first
stormed into your store,

16:33.905 --> 16:35.429
you said there were
three armed Russians?

16:35.472 --> 16:36.996
I'm more worried about
the "armed" than the "Russian."

16:37.039 --> 16:39.824
I'm from Russia, too, you see.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.827
Just to be clear, two of 'em
got away, including him?

16:42.871 --> 16:44.873
Yes, he was here.
Alexei Roman.

16:44.916 --> 16:47.354
I see something on news
about the escape.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.486
This man, there's
something wrong with this man.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.184
I was in the bathroom,
he come in here shouting,

16:51.227 --> 16:53.055
ripping things off the shelf.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.884
You know what he was after?No, but I know he not find it.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.060
Um... [speaks Russian]

16:58.104 --> 17:01.107
That is what he said--
it means "It is not here."

17:01.150 --> 17:02.630
And then Roman fled?No, no.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.414
And then I grab my gun
and I shoot one of them.

17:04.458 --> 17:07.852
He got trapped inside
and then Roman fled.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.158
The suspect stopped talking
after that.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.899
They just took him in
for surgery.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.640
Are you sure that's what
he said after you cuffed him?

17:12.683 --> 17:14.033
That Roman's after his daughter?

17:14.076 --> 17:15.469
CABRERA:
Yeah. Positive.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.818
Roman doesn't have
any children.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.385
We just confirmed it
with Nia.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.082
The guy said "daughter"
clear as day.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.779
We need to find this girl.
Roman's gonna kill her.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.694
Okay, what about Andrew?
Who's he?

17:23.738 --> 17:25.174
We still don't know.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.523
Tan and I will take
another look around here.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.047
HONDO:
Hey, Street.

17:29.352 --> 17:32.921
Okay, roger that.
Okay.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.924
The transfer on 50-Squad--
Alfaro.

17:35.967 --> 17:39.101
Commander tells me the two of
you got some type of history,

17:39.145 --> 17:40.624
and that you wrote a letter.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.757
That letter was supposed
to be private.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.367
It still is.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.978
Hicks didn't say what you wrote,
just that you wrote one.

17:47.022 --> 17:50.025
You want to tell me
what's going on?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.680
I've known Alfaro
since I was 19.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.900
We were in the Academy
together in Long Beach.

17:55.944 --> 17:58.599
I just don't trust him.
I never have.

17:58.642 --> 17:59.991
Can we leave it at that?

18:00.035 --> 18:01.384
Unfortunately, I don't think
we can.

18:01.428 --> 18:04.909
Hey, kid, you've come a long way
since 19.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.694
Hell, you've come
a long way since 25.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.348
Don't let this guy drag you
back into an old beef.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.132
That ain't you anymore.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.440
Hondo, you know you got nothing
to worry about with me. Right?

18:13.483 --> 18:14.963
Of course I do.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.356
But what I don't know is
what Alfaro did to you

18:16.399 --> 18:17.835
that you're still
holding onto.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.795
You want to tell me
what happened?

18:22.188 --> 18:23.972
Fine.

18:24.015 --> 18:25.756
Nia's taking Odette back home.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.149
They're gonna need
protective detail

18:27.193 --> 18:28.933
until we catch Roman.
I spoke to Rocker...

18:28.977 --> 18:30.979
Oh, come on.
You're gonna make me

18:31.022 --> 18:33.024
sit outside some house all day
with Alfaro

18:33.068 --> 18:34.678
to, what, teach me a lesson?

18:34.722 --> 18:37.159
Why don't you think of it
as an opportunity?

18:37.203 --> 18:38.508
A chance to start fresh.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.162
Whatever problem you got
with this guy--

18:40.206 --> 18:43.209
trust issues,
personality clash, whatever--

18:43.252 --> 18:45.602
let's nip it in the bud.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.652
Cabrera, I think I figured out
what they were after

18:51.695 --> 18:53.654
before it all went sideways.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.090
Some sort of humidor.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.047
You think Roman
tore this place apart

18:56.091 --> 18:57.745
over a fancy cigar box?

18:57.788 --> 18:59.573
Came directly from
his nightclub.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.009
Looks rare, old, Russian.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.663
I searched the inventory
for the word "Andrew."

19:02.706 --> 19:05.231
It's the only thing
that came up-- St. Andrew.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.450
Mm, Andrew the Apostle.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.191
This is the patron
saint of Russia.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.845
The brave martyr.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.630
He was hanging on cross
for three days. Very sad.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.066
What do you know
about this piece?

19:15.110 --> 19:17.678
This is antique humidor,
Imperial Russian.

19:17.721 --> 19:18.983
Holds up to 60 cigars.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.420
Where is it?
It's not here.

19:20.463 --> 19:21.812
Some girl came in
last week, she buy it.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.640
That must have been
Roman's daughter.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.034
So we need to know
this girl's name.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.341
She's in real danger.
Can you check your receipts?

19:28.384 --> 19:30.212
Yeah, should be on this list.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.518
[typing on keyboard]

19:31.561 --> 19:34.782
Right there.
That's her name.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.313
[phone vibrates]What's up, Tan?

19:44.357 --> 19:45.575
Is Amber Morgan still at HQ?

19:45.619 --> 19:47.273
Who?The girl who managed

19:47.316 --> 19:48.404
Roman's nightclub. We think
she's Roman's daughter.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.058
He may be trying to kill her.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.365
Hey, Luca, that Amber girl
you guys interviewed,

19:52.408 --> 19:54.323
where is she?She stepped out.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.672
Damn it, she's taking off.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.674
Okay, well, we might be
able to stop her.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.373
How long ago did she leave?

20:00.416 --> 20:01.548
Not long.
She's got to be around.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.029
There. That's her.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.249
LUCA: Hey, Amber, whoa.
Stop the car!Close the gate!

20:07.293 --> 20:10.600
[Luca and Hicks shouting][tires screech]

20:10.644 --> 20:12.950
Amber, I need you to
step out of the vehicle.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.735
We have a few questions
to ask you about your dad.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.084
Come on.

20:17.781 --> 20:21.829
It's true.
Roman's my father.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.657
My mom died when I was 17,

20:23.700 --> 20:27.051
and I found the paternity
test results after the funeral.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.445
She never told Roman
the results, and...

20:29.489 --> 20:31.578
now I know why.

20:31.621 --> 20:34.189
About a week later
I went to Roman's club

20:34.233 --> 20:39.281
and I gave him the proof,
and he hired me.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.805
Life has been
an absolute nightmare since.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.851
And you kept it a secret
from everyone.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.287
That was Roman's only condition.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.985
No one could know
I was his daughter.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.118
We found this in your trunk.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.774
AMBER:
I didn't know what else
to do with it.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.297
I mean, that thing
cost me three grand,

20:55.341 --> 20:56.559
and for what?

20:56.603 --> 20:57.865
Okay, why buy it
in the first place?

20:57.908 --> 20:59.345
For Roman's diamonds.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.564
Diamonds?
What diamonds?

21:01.608 --> 21:04.088
A couple months before
his arrest, I guess I was,

21:04.132 --> 21:06.221
I don't know, eavesdropping.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.311
I overheard Roman say that
he ripped off some jewel thief.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.270
I caught a glimpse of 30,
40 loose diamonds.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.794
He said that it was
$4 million worth,

21:13.837 --> 21:16.536
that that was his 401[k].

21:16.579 --> 21:17.624
He hid them in the false bottom.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.757
They're not there, though.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.498
So, then, where are they?Good question.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.674
When I bought it from
the pawnshop, they were gone.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.590
Look, I'm telling you
the truth, I swear.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.331
If you've known about it
for years,

21:29.375 --> 21:31.028
why wait until now
to start looking for it?I didn't.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.639
A week after his arrest
I went to the club.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.467
I looked, but I couldn't
find it.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.990
He probably hid it.
He was always so paranoid.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.557
I mean, whoever renovated

21:37.600 --> 21:38.949
the place probably found it
and pawned it off.

21:38.993 --> 21:40.995
And when I saw it
on the website a week ago,

21:41.038 --> 21:44.564
I pooled all of the cash
that I had to go get it.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.217
But no diamonds.

21:46.261 --> 21:49.395
And now Roman, he's escaped,
and he knows what I did.

21:49.438 --> 21:50.787
[phone vibrating]

21:50.831 --> 21:52.136
Care if I take a look?

21:54.269 --> 21:56.227
Nine calls from a blocked
number.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.794
That's why I was
trying to run.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.492
So, if you don't have
the diamonds, who does?

21:59.535 --> 22:01.624
Well, that's the $4 million
question.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.365
I have no idea.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.802
All I know is that,
that Roman thinks that I do,

22:05.846 --> 22:09.153
and he's...
he's gonna murder me.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.807
He'll find a way.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.679
Well, we're not gonna
let that happen, young lady.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.158
But we're gonna need
your help when he calls,

22:14.202 --> 22:15.769
and he will.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.727
Loop the rest of the team in
and get her prepped.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.860
When that call comes in,
I want to be ready to pounce.Okay.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.391
Inspector General?

22:29.435 --> 22:31.132
You must be Nichelle.

22:31.175 --> 22:33.177
I just had
to meet the woman

22:33.221 --> 22:35.615
who got COPE up and running
in one year.

22:35.658 --> 22:38.095
What you accomplished is
a damn miracle.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.141
I'd, uh, tell you to sit, but...

22:40.184 --> 22:41.969
Well, thank you for
seeing me on short notice,

22:42.012 --> 22:43.318
Inspector General.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.407
Look, I'll just cut
to the chase.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.540
Is it true you're recommending
COPE be folded

22:47.583 --> 22:48.715
under the LAPD?

22:48.758 --> 22:50.412
Yes, that's what
I'm recommending.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.761
Don't you understand
that negates

22:51.805 --> 22:53.110
the whole point of the program?

22:53.154 --> 22:55.199
Nichelle,

22:55.243 --> 22:58.942
you run on
charitable contributions, right?

22:58.986 --> 23:02.206
How's that going
in this economy?

23:02.250 --> 23:03.904
We've raised half as much
as we did last year,

23:03.947 --> 23:05.166
but there's still
a few months left.

23:05.209 --> 23:07.168
COPE shouldn't rely
on goodwill.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.692
It should be a stable part of
L.A's emergency response system.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.608
If the city funds it,
we can double its budget,

23:12.652 --> 23:14.131
if you agree to the terms.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.655
And if I don't,
you'll cut off all access

23:15.698 --> 23:17.308
to 911 dispatch.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.223
Only because we'll be starting
our own official program.

23:19.267 --> 23:22.488
All thanks to you.
You should be proud.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.317
Nichelle, would you
be interested in

23:26.361 --> 23:28.145
continuing to oversee COPE,

23:28.189 --> 23:29.756
even if it were a part
of the LAPD?

23:29.799 --> 23:31.627
How could I?
I'm a civilian.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.542
So am I.
So are all five members

23:33.586 --> 23:35.022
of the police commission
I report to.

23:35.065 --> 23:37.198
We oversee every aspect

23:37.241 --> 23:38.678
of the LAPD.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.767
The commission doesn't
have to listen to my office,

23:40.810 --> 23:43.596
but they usually do.

23:43.639 --> 23:47.121
I'm budgeted for six police
performance auditors,

23:47.164 --> 23:50.472
but Glenda just moved
to Miami, so I only have five.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.648
What do you say?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.479
So, what'd you say?No, obviously.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.481
How can I audit cops when
I live with a SWAT sergeant?

23:59.525 --> 24:02.615
Isn't that a conflict
of interests?Did you ask her that?

24:02.658 --> 24:03.920
She said it wasn't a problem.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.531
Sounds like she wants you
to accept.

24:05.574 --> 24:06.619
If you're worried about me
taking the job, don't.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.403
I already
turned her down.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.275
Hey, everything okay with you?

24:11.319 --> 24:13.321
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I'm sorry.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.757
I think this prisoner escape
this morning

24:14.801 --> 24:16.367
did a number on me.

24:16.411 --> 24:17.804
Yeah, it sounds like it
threw you for a loop.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.720
[elevator bell chimes]Elevator's here.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.069
Stay safe, okay?

24:22.112 --> 24:24.680
Baby, I will.
I'll see you later.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.595
All right, when Roman calls,

24:26.639 --> 24:28.510
what is the one and
only thing that matters?

24:28.554 --> 24:31.731
Picking a place to
hand over the diamonds.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.864
He realizes that
I don't have them

24:34.908 --> 24:37.780
and it's a setup,
I'm as good as dead.

24:37.824 --> 24:40.043
You just keep your eye
on the ball, Amber.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.306
You tell Roman you have
the diamonds,

24:42.350 --> 24:44.439
get him to pick a spot,
and then you hang up.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.136
[phone vibrating]

24:46.180 --> 24:48.487
Oh, my God, it's him.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.923
Hey, relax.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.011
Just answer the phone
when you're ready.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.535
Keep it simple.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.628
Hello?

24:59.672 --> 25:01.717
ROMAN:
I made it out, you know.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.850
I thought you were gonna
be locked up forever.

25:03.893 --> 25:07.636
Otherwise I, uh, never would
have taken your diamonds.

25:08.768 --> 25:12.119
You can have them.
They're yours.

25:12.162 --> 25:15.383
He's bouncing between
cell towers.

25:15.426 --> 25:18.125
It'll settle.
Just need time.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.388
I need to know that
you're not gonna hurt me, Roman.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.911
Years ago, when you
quit the club

25:21.955 --> 25:24.784
and walked out for good,
what'd you say?

25:24.827 --> 25:26.916
You almost killed me, Roman.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.092
That night, what'd you say?

25:29.136 --> 25:31.530
I said that you never
trusted me.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.358
See now? I was right
not to trust

25:34.402 --> 25:35.577
a dirty thief like you.

25:35.621 --> 25:36.883
I'm not a thief.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.362
You stole my diamonds,
little girl.

25:38.406 --> 25:41.104
That is exactly what you are.I'm sorry.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.367
I will hunt you to
the end of the earth

25:43.411 --> 25:45.979
if you don't pay me back.I don't have them, okay?

25:46.022 --> 25:48.242
I-I went to the club
after you got caught,

25:48.285 --> 25:49.591
but the humidor wasn't
where you left it.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.071
The cops made me lie, and...

25:51.114 --> 25:54.030
Listen to me, cops,
I want what is mine.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.337
Then I will go back to Russia.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.688
Just forget about me.Not on your life.

25:59.732 --> 26:02.169
I only ever hear
that phrase twice.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.605
First time today.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.912
You are cop from this morning.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.217
Sergeant Harrelson, LAPD.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.089
You're going back
to prison, Roman.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.874
You get to decide how hard you
want to make this on yourself.

26:11.918 --> 26:15.051
Does this scare me?
Not on your life.

26:24.365 --> 26:27.324
ALFARO: Not what I expected
my first day in the big leagues.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.283
Yeah, it's not what I
signed up for either.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.328
Gonna tell me why we got
sent out here like this?

26:31.372 --> 26:32.373
How should I know?

26:32.416 --> 26:34.723
Okay. Then tell me why

26:34.767 --> 26:36.029
you haven't said
two words to me?

26:38.509 --> 26:41.512
Whew! This ice will not keep
in this heat.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.340
[laughs]Thank you.

26:43.384 --> 26:44.515
Thank you. Yeah.

26:44.559 --> 26:45.516
Here, would you like one?

26:45.560 --> 26:46.779
I'm good, thank you.

26:46.822 --> 26:47.823
Oh, he's trying
to make fighting weight.

26:47.867 --> 26:48.998
Huh?

26:49.042 --> 26:50.870
Beach Bouts.
Come on, you remember.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.874
Long Beach PD does
a boxing tourney every summer.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.310
First year, I beat Streeter.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.007
Second year, vice versa.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.618
Year three, and they add
a new weight class last minute,

26:59.661 --> 27:02.272
but the cutoff is
smack-dab between us.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.709
This psycho over here
loses ten pounds in one week

27:03.752 --> 27:04.927
just so he can fight me.[women laugh]

27:04.971 --> 27:06.320
Then I kicked your ass.

27:06.363 --> 27:08.191
No, not how I remember it.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.933
Well, thank you for being here

27:10.977 --> 27:12.456
and being our peace of mind.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.675
If you need anything,
we'll just be inside

27:13.719 --> 27:15.111
packing up a few things.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.025
I'm just gonna grab
a few more boxes.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.157
Do you mind?
Oh, yeah.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.333
I'll be right in.Okay.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.338
Can I carry that for you?

27:24.381 --> 27:26.470
Oh, that'd be great.I got you.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.081
Thanks.Yeah.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.823
Finally have a reason to
get rid of that ugly thing.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.389
Wouldn't be the worst thing
if you dropped it.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.652
[chuckles]

27:33.695 --> 27:35.958
So you're packing up
as in relocating?

27:36.002 --> 27:38.265
I've considered
selling the place for a while,

27:38.308 --> 27:40.702
but I never had the heart
to go through Lee's things.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.749
After today, though,
it's time to move on.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.752
Yeah.
You know, I-I saw you
out there this morning.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.754
Explain to me how you
keep doing your job

27:48.797 --> 27:50.625
after insanity like that.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.845
Well, the answer
I usually give is,

27:52.888 --> 27:54.281
we go through
a lot of training.

27:54.324 --> 27:57.937
But the truth is,
it's tough.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.765
You know, it stays with you.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.901
[sighs]
Hey, um...

28:05.945 --> 28:07.816
I'm sorry for what
happened to your husband.

28:07.860 --> 28:11.037
Thanks. I, uh...

28:11.080 --> 28:12.734
I wanted to bury Lee
out here.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.823
You know, he really
loved this place.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.130
Racing dirt bikes and
motorcycles with his buddies.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.219
[chuckles]

28:19.262 --> 28:23.092
I swear I can still hear 'em
at night sometimes.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.616
If you don't mind my asking,

28:25.660 --> 28:28.489
how'd he end up
driving for Roman?

28:28.532 --> 28:29.620
He needed the work,
and Roman was

28:29.664 --> 28:31.448
the only one offering.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.407
You know, he didn't know about
the criminal stuff at first,

28:33.450 --> 28:36.410
but once Nia approached him
about being an informant,

28:36.453 --> 28:37.759
he didn't flinch.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.501
He always knew
the right thing to do.

28:40.544 --> 28:44.810
What Roman put you through,
that's beyond cruel.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.681
You deserve to have answers.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.944
Thanks.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.294
I just feel so stupid.

28:51.338 --> 28:52.731
You know, I should have known
that he had no intention

28:52.774 --> 28:55.951
of giving over Lee's remains.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.213
[exhales sharply]

28:57.257 --> 28:58.606
You know that saying?

28:58.649 --> 29:00.434
When people show you
who they are,

29:00.477 --> 29:03.176
believe them.
[chuckles]

29:07.397 --> 29:10.139
When Roman called Amber,
his burner phone pinged

29:10.183 --> 29:11.924
two different cell towers
in the Valley.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.621
Seemed like he was
headed northwest.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.492
So we got a direction
but not a destination.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.233
That's better than nothing.

29:17.277 --> 29:20.367
Maybe if we could figure out who
really stole Roman's diamonds.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.021
Then we could, what,
use 'em as bait?

29:22.064 --> 29:23.762
I mean, I doubt Roman's
gonna fall for that again.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.111
Check it out.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.983
Lee Cobb audio files.
That's Roman's driver.

29:28.027 --> 29:29.985
These must be
the recordings he made

29:30.029 --> 29:32.205
working as an informant.Pop it in.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.295
LEE [over computer]:
My name is Lee Cobb.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.340
I'm a driver for Alexei Roman.

29:37.384 --> 29:40.082
Today is Saturday,
July 16, 2016.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.518
Two days before
Roman killed him.This afternoon,

29:41.562 --> 29:43.172
I started having second
thoughts about

29:43.216 --> 29:44.217
ratting on a guy like Roman.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.653
I thought it might be better

29:45.696 --> 29:46.828
if me and Odette run off,

29:46.872 --> 29:49.483
start fresh, so I took his ice.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.877
It was a stupid move,
I'm gonna put 'em back.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.443
Wanted someone to know.

29:53.487 --> 29:54.662
Ice as in diamonds.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.403
The D.A. didn't even know

29:56.446 --> 29:57.578
about the diamonds at the time,

29:57.621 --> 29:58.927
so it probably got overlooked.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.408
Where do you think
Lee stashed them?

30:01.451 --> 30:02.583
[line rings]

30:02.626 --> 30:04.150
It's Street, leave a message.

30:04.193 --> 30:05.499
Street's phone's going
straight to voice mail.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.370
Go grab the team.
I'll get Hondo.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.505
I haven't been able
to bring myself

30:11.548 --> 30:12.854
to go through Lee's things.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.377
[sniffs deeply]

30:14.421 --> 30:17.293
It's like he's
right here with me.

30:17.337 --> 30:18.642
Maybe you've come
a little further

30:18.686 --> 30:21.210
than you think
the past few years.

30:21.254 --> 30:23.212
This looks like it
could be your size.

30:23.256 --> 30:24.648
[laughs]

30:24.692 --> 30:26.085
I should get back out there.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.390
Come on, go ahead.

30:27.434 --> 30:30.785
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.787
Yeah.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.920
See? Yeah, it looks good.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.356
It's yours if you want it.

30:36.399 --> 30:40.447
Thank you, but that is
way too generous, so...

30:40.490 --> 30:41.622
I should get back
to my post.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.189
Yeah, no, of course.
Yeah.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.538
Thanks.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.890
Are you trying to
blackball me from SWAT?

30:48.934 --> 30:52.285
Got a text from Rocker
about a letter you wrote.That's right.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.113
I wrote a letter to Hicks.

30:54.156 --> 30:55.505
I said I didn't think you'd be
a good fit for the depar...

30:55.549 --> 30:57.420
What's your deal, bro?You know my deal.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.988
Three months before
I left Long Beach?

31:00.032 --> 31:02.773
The anonymous complaint?
I know it was you.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.298
I didn't think it would turn
into that big of a thing.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.952
Our rivalry, or whatever,
had gotten pretty intense.

31:06.995 --> 31:09.911
You accused me of being
a dirty cop.

31:09.955 --> 31:12.348
You said I took kickbacks
from dealers.

31:12.392 --> 31:13.828
Guess I was just letting off
some steam.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.960
Half your childhood buddies
had been sitting

31:15.003 --> 31:16.439
in the back of my squad car,

31:16.483 --> 31:17.788
and then you just showed up
with a bike?

31:17.832 --> 31:19.660
That complaint almost
cost me everything.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.183
I never would have done it
if your deadbeat buddy

31:21.227 --> 31:22.445
wasn't dropping your name
all across town.

31:22.489 --> 31:23.751
What did you say?

31:23.794 --> 31:25.622
Nick. Or Tate or whatever.Nate!

31:25.666 --> 31:26.797
The only brother
I ever had.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.408
A total scumbag.

31:28.451 --> 31:31.193
[both grunting, groaning]

31:34.153 --> 31:36.851
What the hell?
What is that?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.200
They fell out
of that jacket.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.115
Roman's diamonds.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.639
[vehicle approaching]

31:44.554 --> 31:45.991
Follow me.

31:48.428 --> 31:50.343
Odette, Nia,
you're in danger!

31:50.386 --> 31:52.736
We need to move you out
of the house.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.434
Upstairs.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.828
Let's go.
Backup's on the way.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.918
Here, I-I found
Lee's old pistol.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.354
His diamonds were
in Lee's jacket.

32:01.397 --> 32:02.746
Oh, my God.Where's Nia?

32:02.790 --> 32:04.226
I-I wasn't sure I had a gun,

32:04.270 --> 32:05.924
and she said she has one
in her glove box.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.969
She went out to her car?Yeah, we saw the truck coming.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.449
I-Is it Roman?We've got to get

32:09.492 --> 32:11.146
her out of here.
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go!

32:23.158 --> 32:24.725
You find Nia, I'll get
Odette somewhere safe

32:24.768 --> 32:26.248
and come back.Roger that.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.907
Odette!

32:32.951 --> 32:34.648
Go, go, go.That rat husband of yours

32:34.691 --> 32:36.128
took something of mine.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.312
NIA:
Get off me! Stop!

32:46.355 --> 32:48.227
It's Nia. Move, move.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.976
I'll make contact, you stay low.
Try to get an angle.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.107
Roger that.

32:59.151 --> 33:00.587
NIA:
Please don't hurt me.

33:00.630 --> 33:03.111
LAPD! Drop the gun
and let her go.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.338
Stay calm. Nobody needs
to get hurt here.

33:12.381 --> 33:13.992
Stay back.
I'll kill her.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.950
I'm not ready to die.

33:18.126 --> 33:19.475
Be ready, Tan.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.478
What are you doing?!

33:22.522 --> 33:24.741
Stop moving!Calm down. We can fix this.

33:24.785 --> 33:25.742
[gunshot]

33:25.786 --> 33:27.266
[cries out]

33:29.224 --> 33:31.922
[sobbing]It's okay.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.490
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay. It's over.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.887
[Roman grunts]

33:42.237 --> 33:44.196
In the back.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.067
Quick.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.808
Stay low.
No one's getting in.

33:47.851 --> 33:49.984
ALFARO:
I lost Roman.
He's got the diamonds.

33:52.943 --> 33:54.597
[motorcycle engine revving]

33:54.641 --> 33:58.514
Hey, stop! Stop!

33:58.558 --> 34:00.951
26-David in pursuit.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.629
Street, we're headed your way.
20 seconds out.

34:36.248 --> 34:39.338
â™ª

34:57.182 --> 34:59.314
â™ª

35:09.846 --> 35:12.893
Come on, stay with me.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.373
30-David. Suspect down.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.810
Wake up. You're not
getting out that easy.

35:16.853 --> 35:19.595
[groans]

35:19.639 --> 35:22.859
Roman, I'm afraid
you're gonna be okay.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.042
Nice shiner you got there.

35:32.086 --> 35:34.480
Oh. Yes, sir.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.134
Suspect must have
got me pretty good.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.700
[chuckles]
Right.

35:37.744 --> 35:38.832
Sergeant Harrelson.

35:38.875 --> 35:39.920
Yes, sir. I know
who you are.

35:39.963 --> 35:42.183
I'm...
Officer Alfaro.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.664
Your reputation
precedes you, too.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.144
Commander tells me
that you're joining us

35:46.187 --> 35:47.623
with quite the impressive
track record.

35:47.667 --> 35:48.711
I'm lucky to be here
in L.A.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.235
Yes, you are.

35:50.278 --> 35:53.020
You're gonna be working with
some fine folks up here.

35:53.063 --> 35:56.023
And one of the best of 'em is
Officer Street right there.

35:56.066 --> 35:57.851
I'm guessing the two of you know
each other from Long Beach.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.331
We do.

35:59.374 --> 36:02.899
Okay. Well, you follow
his lead...

36:02.943 --> 36:04.597
and it'll be smooth sailing.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.035
I'll do that, sir.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.168
Glad to hear it.

36:17.610 --> 36:21.309
Hey, this will take
some time to process.

36:21.353 --> 36:23.137
Important thing is,
you're okay.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.400
I'm supposed to be dead.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.187
I'm never gonna get
this out of my head.

36:29.230 --> 36:32.190
Sometimes a bad day
is just a bad day.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.844
Don't let it be more, Nia.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.412
You don't have to
let it define you

36:37.456 --> 36:39.109
or where you're headed
in life.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.938
They're gonna need
your statement.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.766
Come on, I'll walk you over.

36:43.810 --> 36:46.247
NIA:
Hey.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.598
I'm sorry about what
I said to you earlier.

36:49.642 --> 36:51.034
If it made you feel

36:51.078 --> 36:54.124
some type of way about anything,
I'm sorry.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.996
Thank you.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.184
Streeter--
Street, wait up.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.533
Look, can I just get
a word in, man?

37:11.577 --> 37:16.277
Alfaro, listen.
I never should have hit you.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.932
It was a mistake for me
to escalate things like that.

37:18.975 --> 37:21.587
If you need to file on me...No, that's not gonna happen.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.285
Look, I owe you an apology for
what I did to you back then.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.200
I was young and immature.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.290
No, look, I have no excuses.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.813
Thanks.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.293
And the things I said
about your buddy Nate,

37:32.337 --> 37:33.773
I didn't even know the guy.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.731
I sure as hell didn't know
he passed away.

37:35.775 --> 37:38.734
I was just trying
to tick you off.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.736
I'm real sorry for that.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.391
Something you should know,
Alfaro, the way things

37:43.435 --> 37:46.002
used to be with us--
the smack talk,

37:46.046 --> 37:49.658
the-the, the constant combat--

37:49.702 --> 37:51.269
it's not gonna be
like that here.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.835
That's not even
who I am anymore.
I know, man.

37:52.879 --> 37:54.489
Look, I can see

37:54.533 --> 37:55.882
right off the bat that you
changed for the better.

37:55.925 --> 37:58.276
I like to think
I have as well.

38:00.626 --> 38:01.888
One more thing.

38:02.802 --> 38:04.238
I saved up for that bike.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.022
That was a sweet-ass bike.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.589
It really was, wasn't it?[laughs]

38:07.633 --> 38:08.895
See you tomorrow.

38:08.938 --> 38:11.114
Yeah, hey,
hell of a first day.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.776
Hey. Nichelle's waiting
for you out front.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.387
Yeah, yeah, thanks.We, uh,

38:22.430 --> 38:24.084
we have dinner plans.

38:24.127 --> 38:26.216
[chuckles]
An hour ago.

38:26.260 --> 38:27.609
Ah.So it looks
like we're

38:27.653 --> 38:29.307
gonna be hitting
the drive-through instead.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.917
Already living
the dad life.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.701
Yeah, something like that.

38:32.745 --> 38:36.009
Hey, uh, Nia sounded

38:36.052 --> 38:38.359
pretty contrite earlier.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.187
What was it she said
to you that's kinda

38:40.230 --> 38:42.189
taken the wind
out of your sails?

38:42.232 --> 38:44.322
Apparently I told her
once upon a time

38:44.365 --> 38:45.540
that I didn't want kids.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.847
That I had too much
childhood baggage

38:47.890 --> 38:49.501
to be a good dad.

38:49.544 --> 38:50.719
Well, nice to see you, too, Nia.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.025
I mean, look,
I-I don't really think

38:52.068 --> 38:54.070
she meant to put it
out there like that.

38:54.114 --> 38:56.290
But if she did, who knows?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.988
Deacon, Nichelle and I,
we are so excited

38:59.032 --> 39:00.599
to welcome this child
into the world,

39:00.642 --> 39:03.036
and nothing...
nothing's gonna change that.

39:03.079 --> 39:08.302
But these,
these childhood wounds...

39:08.346 --> 39:10.260
I mean, I do have to admit
there is a part of me

39:10.304 --> 39:12.088
that's worried that
I'm gonna carry these scars

39:12.132 --> 39:14.177
into my relationship
with my little girl.All right,

39:14.221 --> 39:16.441
you're probably tired
of the unsolicited advice today,

39:16.484 --> 39:17.964
but I got to step in
here, say something.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.358
You're gonna be a great father.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.621
We're gonna find out, right?No, no.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.274
I already know it.

39:24.318 --> 39:25.798
And I'm not just saying this
to make you feel better.

39:25.841 --> 39:28.801
You are a born teacher.
You're a born protector.

39:28.844 --> 39:30.890
That's what a father is.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.761
From the moment your daughter
takes her first breath,

39:32.805 --> 39:35.111
you're gonna help her develop
the tools she needs to thrive.

39:35.155 --> 39:36.635
And then, as she grows,

39:36.678 --> 39:38.550
you're gonna help her
strengthen those tools

39:38.593 --> 39:42.249
so that then she can teach
and protect her own family.

39:42.292 --> 39:45.078
You're gonna do those things
because that's who you are.

39:45.121 --> 39:46.775
You don't have to worry if
you're gonna be a great father.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.298
You're a natural.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.476
Thank you, Deac.
That means more than you know.

39:51.519 --> 39:52.868
Especially coming from you.

39:52.912 --> 39:53.826
Well, I do have a mug at home
that says

39:53.869 --> 39:55.131
"World's Greatest Dad."

39:55.175 --> 39:57.482
[laughing]:
Yeah, I bet you do.

39:57.525 --> 40:00.441
Whatever Nia put in your head,
forget about it.

40:00.485 --> 40:05.925
You and Nichelle are going to
mold this-this beautiful,

40:05.968 --> 40:07.970
wonderful human being.

40:08.014 --> 40:10.843
And I can't wait to meet her.

40:10.886 --> 40:13.759
Neither can I.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.212
[indistinct conversation]

40:44.529 --> 40:46.705
Hey.
Hey.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.881
Sorry for the wait.
All good.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.186
I know you've had a long day.

40:50.230 --> 40:51.710
Listen, I had a lot
of time to think

40:51.753 --> 40:53.363
on the ride back,

40:53.407 --> 40:55.017
and this job offer
from the inspector general...

40:55.061 --> 40:57.324
Baby, if it's something
you want,

40:57.367 --> 40:58.804
I'm behind you 100%.

40:58.847 --> 41:02.372
I've been thinking
about it, too.

41:02.416 --> 41:03.765
The position is part-time,

41:03.809 --> 41:05.985
so I get to keep
looking after COPE,

41:06.028 --> 41:07.900
but I don't have to give up
the community center.

41:07.943 --> 41:11.251
Plus, the LAPD has
a few social programs

41:11.294 --> 41:13.514
in their portfolio nowadays,
so it's not like

41:13.558 --> 41:15.429
I'd only be auditing officers.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.084
Maybe I'd be able
to do some good.

41:18.127 --> 41:19.868
Of course you would.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.653
The LAPD could use
someone like you

41:21.696 --> 41:24.873
looking after us
and keeping us honest.

41:24.917 --> 41:28.747
If it really appeals to you,
then I want you to go get it.

41:28.790 --> 41:29.835
Take the job.

41:29.878 --> 41:32.098
[sighs]

41:36.102 --> 41:37.407
You're really
not gonna ask me

41:37.451 --> 41:38.974
what the two of us
were talking about?

41:39.018 --> 41:40.846
What do you mean?

41:40.889 --> 41:43.152
Two of who?
