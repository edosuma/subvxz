than the hat has
ever been asked to contain.

37:43.673 --> 37:45.573
Do what you need to do.

37:45.574 --> 37:49.444
"Purest evil, blackest bloom,

37:49.445 --> 37:51.779
darkness, too, can find its doom."

37:51.780 --> 37:53.415
[ squish ]

37:53.416 --> 37:55.235
[ heartbeat ]

38:02.992 --> 38:05.760
"Never dying, but contained,

38:05.761 --> 38:08.863
bound inside the falcon's chamber,

38:08.864 --> 38:12.867
shorn of anger, thornless danger,

38:12.868 --> 38:16.166
there forever to remain."

38:34.523 --> 38:36.652
[ heartbeat continues ]

38:41.097 --> 38:42.572
[ grunts ]

38:45.968 --> 38:47.478
He's barely breathing.

38:48.771 --> 38:51.806
Rumplestiltskin was the Dark One
for centuries.

38:51.807 --> 38:55.895
His return to the man
he used to be will not be easy.

38:57.113 --> 38:58.847
This will preserve him

38:58.848 --> 39:00.915
until we discern
if we can help him.

39:00.916 --> 39:02.050
"If"?

39:02.051 --> 39:04.152
[ whooshing ]

39:04.153 --> 39:06.213
Everybody step back.

39:20.636 --> 39:23.143
[ gagging ]

39:56.872 --> 39:58.773
Mom, dad!
Go after it!

39:58.774 --> 40:00.542
Go!
I'll be right there.

40:00.543 --> 40:04.045
Help me
make him comfortable.

40:04.046 --> 40:06.147
[ grunts ]

40:06.148 --> 40:08.950
What was that?

40:08.951 --> 40:14.889
[ weakly ] Long before...
Your stories began...

40:14.890 --> 40:17.959
The sorcerer
battled the darkness.

40:17.960 --> 40:23.998
He was able to keep it
from consuming the realms.

40:23.999 --> 40:26.234
He tethered it
to a human soul

40:26.235 --> 40:30.116
that could be controlled
with a dagger.

40:32.241 --> 40:33.992
The Dark One.

40:36.712 --> 40:39.981
The sorcerer is the only one
with the power

40:39.982 --> 40:42.183
to destroy the darkness
once and for all

40:42.184 --> 40:44.953
before it destroys
everything.

40:44.954 --> 40:46.888
Where is he?
Who is he?

40:46.889 --> 40:50.225
He's far, far from here.

40:50.226 --> 40:52.060
Find him.

40:52.061 --> 40:54.705
His name is...

40:55.798 --> 40:57.308
Merlin.

40:59.101 --> 41:03.204
You must... Stop...

41:03.205 --> 41:06.608
The darkness.

41:06.609 --> 41:10.112
Find... Merlin.

41:12.047 --> 41:15.116
[ panting ]

41:15.117 --> 41:16.117
Where is it?!

41:16.118 --> 41:17.151
We don't know.

41:17.152 --> 41:19.316
It just disappeared
into the night.

41:20.990 --> 41:22.290
<i>Regina: Hey, what's going on?</i>

41:22.291 --> 41:24.992
The Dark One... it's no longer
tethered to the crocodile.

41:24.993 --> 41:26.094
What?!

41:26.170 --> 41:27.920
Where the hell is it?

41:33.602 --> 41:35.003
It hasn't gone anywhere.

41:35.004 --> 41:40.054
The darkness...
it's surrounding us.

41:42.311 --> 41:43.993
[ gasps ]

41:46.915 --> 41:48.494
<i>Robin: Regina!</i>

41:53.989 --> 41:54.989
What's it doing?!

41:54.990 --> 41:56.925
What darkness does...

41:56.926 --> 41:59.192
Snuffing out the light.

42:00.262 --> 42:01.669
I'm not gonna let it.

42:04.099 --> 42:07.019
That's not gonna work
on this thing!

42:07.703 --> 42:08.803
The Apprentice told me

42:08.804 --> 42:11.005
we have to do
what the sorcerer did!

42:11.006 --> 42:13.272
We have to tether it
to a person to contain it!

42:14.143 --> 42:16.375
Emma! No!

42:18.614 --> 42:20.748
[ voice breaking ]
There has to be another way!

42:20.749 --> 42:23.585
There isn't.

42:23.586 --> 42:26.986
You've worked to hard to have
your happiness destroyed.

42:28.157 --> 42:29.412
No!

42:29.558 --> 42:31.960
You figured out how to take
the darkness out of me once.

42:31.961 --> 42:35.063
[ voice breaking ]
You need to do it again...

42:35.064 --> 42:36.127
As heroes.

42:37.866 --> 42:40.001
<i>Hook: Emma! Emma, please!</i>

42:40.002 --> 42:41.302
No.

42:41.303 --> 42:43.088
Don't do this,

42:45.708 --> 42:47.046
I love you.

42:49.678 --> 42:50.278
No!

42:50.279 --> 42:52.098
[ grunts ]

43:02.224 --> 43:04.147
Aah!

43:08.964 --> 43:10.784
Aaaaaah!

43:13.769 --> 43:17.032
