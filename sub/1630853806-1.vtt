00:10.176 --> 00:11.928
Happy birthday, baby.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.849
I believe I just got you and your year
off to a pretty great start.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.726
And I thought I said no gifts.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.189
Mm.

00:28.278 --> 00:32.032
Hey, I prepped your birthday breakfast,
but my showing got moved up by an hour,

00:32.115 --> 00:35.493
so you'll have to finish without me
for the second time today.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.620
That's okay. I'm not very hungry.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.416
I'm having a hard time with this birthday.

00:41.499 --> 00:46.296
Oh! Come on. I mean, 50? 50 is so young.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.425
People only use "50" and "so young"
in the same sentence at a funeral.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.510
Sorry. I have no time to indulge

00:52.594 --> 00:56.473
a hot, virile, super successful dude
in a bonkers pity party.

00:58.099 --> 01:01.478
-You really are so handsome.
-And you're a really cute liar.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.566
Ah. Ah! I gotta bounce.
Okay, the reservation is at 7:30.

01:06.649 --> 01:09.110
My last showing is at 6:00,
so I'll meet you at the restaurant.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.529
-Okay.
-I'll text you the address.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.990
Oh, I'm glad
it's just the two of us tonight.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.825
A nice, cozy little celebration

01:15.909 --> 01:18.286
of the milestone
that dare not speak its name.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.455
Mm.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.873
I love you, old-timer.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.839
Yes, Eric will be there
at 7:30 on the dot.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.093
Everyone knows they have to be there
by 7:15 or wait until 8:00.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.929
Oh, and a reminder
about the lighting. Dim, dim, dim.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.014
This is a 50th birthday.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.140
Thanks.

01:39.224 --> 01:43.061
Oh, hey. Quick, before we meet
the clients, with or without the scarf?

01:43.144 --> 01:44.395
So without.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.731
Even with this neck?
It's not too gobble gobble?

01:46.815 --> 01:48.525
-Are you crazy?
-Oh!

01:48.608 --> 01:52.028
And in other bad news,
Tyler Hawkins got the Beresford listing.

01:52.112 --> 01:56.241
Are you kidding? They went with
that smug, entitled millennial over us?

01:56.324 --> 01:59.327
That is just the cherry on
the shit parfait that is my life lately.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.788
-I went out with that guy I met on Hinge.
-Yeah.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.541
Suffice it to say,
they should rename that app "Unhinged."

02:04.624 --> 02:08.878
The psycho bastard told me
I would be so hot if I lost ten pounds,

02:08.962 --> 02:10.588
but I could sit on his face anyway.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.715
-So chivalry's not dead.
-Funny.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.136
How's the, uh, party prep?
Colin remotely suspicious?

02:16.219 --> 02:19.055
Nope. He thinks
we're going to dinner, just the two of us.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.640
He is going to be blown away.

02:20.723 --> 02:24.602
We've recreated the whole Limelight
from when we first met.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.146
I walked into this club.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.231
I saw Colin, and I thought--

02:28.314 --> 02:29.274
"He's the one."

02:29.357 --> 02:32.735
No, I thought, "How can I find a way
to rub up on his ass

02:32.819 --> 02:34.571
-and look like I'm just dancing?"

02:35.905 --> 02:38.199
I can't believe it's been 17 years.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.785
Ah, and you're still not married? Smart.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.289
It's my secret.
He's my BFF. My boyfriend forever.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.582
B-A-R-F.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.333
-Wow.
-Seriously.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.421
A handsome, stand-up guy,
who's also a hedge fund manager.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.840
Who do I have to blow
to get me one of those?

02:53.923 --> 02:54.883
Him, actually.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.801
-Oh, here they come.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.889
Hey, you two! We are so excited about 12G.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.184
-Excuse me.
-Uh…

03:05.226 --> 03:06.227
Hey, Carmen, what's up?

03:07.937 --> 03:10.106
Why don't you guys go up?
I'll be there in a sec.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.526
Wait, Car, are you sure?
What did they take?

03:17.238 --> 03:19.824
They're in there creaming
over the rainforest shower.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.867
We got robbed.

03:20.950 --> 03:21.910
-What?
-Yeah.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.746
The housekeeper said
they took clothes and wine.

03:24.829 --> 03:25.747
And what else?

03:25.830 --> 03:29.542
A Sonos speaker and Hermès towels
that are too nice to actually use.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.086
Sounds like somebody's havin'
a gay yard sale.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.798
-So! Are we ready to change zip codes?

03:44.515 --> 03:47.185
I'm out front. He'll be here any sec.
Is everyone in position?

03:47.268 --> 03:50.021
-<i>Yes, it's Limelight in here.</i>
-Great. That's very exciting.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.773
<i>-Oh my God, I can't wait! </i>
-Oh!

03:51.856 --> 03:55.360
Please, no squealing, Eric.
You're the reason blue states turn red.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.278
Real-- Oh. Here he is. Gotta go. Bye.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.199
Hey, birthday boy.

04:03.326 --> 04:07.914
Gosh, the tension in your shoulders
is off the charts. What's goin' on?

04:09.290 --> 04:11.459
Where's this restaurant?
I don't see any signs.

04:11.542 --> 04:15.004
It's right up here, and there are
no signs. It's very exclusive.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.298
There might even be a password. Who knows?

04:17.382 --> 04:20.510
I left three messages for you. Never heard
back. Did you check out the apartment?

04:20.593 --> 04:21.719
We weren't robbed.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.930
Carmen said all that stuff went missing.

04:24.013 --> 04:27.892
-Suzanne thinks it may be an inside job--
-Michael. Michael, we weren't robbed.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.937
I took my clothes and some things,
and I moved out.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.734
Surprise!

04:40.571 --> 04:42.991
-Hey!
-Ah! It's your birthday! I'm so excited!

04:43.074 --> 04:46.452
Here, baby. Congrats. It is fabulous.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.871
Mikey, this is Wyatt.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.373
-Hi.
-Happy birthday.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.625
No, no. That's Colin, sweetie.
Remember I told you.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.295
This is Michael, my best friend.
We went to high school together.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.838
-Hi.
-It's his partner's…

04:56.921 --> 04:59.841
Oh, right. I'm so sorry.
It was a pretty quick tutorial.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.345
How adorable is he?
He couldn't name three Cher songs.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.763
I mean, isn't she, like, 80?

05:05.847 --> 05:10.727
-Yeah, but she's got your abs, so respect.
-Hey, Billy, I'm gonna go find--

05:10.810 --> 05:14.897
Hello, Michael. Billy.
And I assume Billy's new child bride.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.692
Wyatt, this is Stanley.
He's a very successful art dealer

05:17.775 --> 05:19.402
and much less successful homo.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.405
-Um, we don't really use that word.
-I really need to find--

05:22.488 --> 05:24.782
-Go, go, go. Do your host thing.
-Okay.

05:24.866 --> 05:25.992
And relax, sweetie.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.702
You look more shocked than Colin.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.041
-Yay, you pulled it off.
-Hey!

05:33.124 --> 05:36.586
-I assume he never saw it coming.
-He never suspected a thing.

05:36.669 --> 05:37.670
-Hey, Kai.
-Hey.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.214
I'm guessing not a ton
of straight women here under 30?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.758
Kai, you're with your mother tonight.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.135
Can we please give the pussy patrol
the evening off?

05:44.218 --> 05:45.720
-Such a great party!

05:45.803 --> 05:48.097
We danced, we did poppers,
we're young again.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.433
-Look at you.
-Hi, Suzanne!

05:50.516 --> 05:53.686
-Who's your hot date?
-Uh, my son, you perv.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.606
-Kai, meet Jonathan and Jonathan.
-The Jonathans!

05:56.689 --> 05:58.816
-That's funny.
-You guys ready for the big snip?

05:58.900 --> 06:01.235
Oh, that's right.
Um, they have a baby boy.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.781
The bris is in a couple of days,
and Michael and Colin are the godfathers.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.824
Aww! Congratulations!

06:06.908 --> 06:08.910
Sorry. I just need to talk to…

06:12.372 --> 06:14.874
Oh, honey! We're having the best time.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.293
-Oh, thanks, Mom.
-Aww! Oh!

06:17.377 --> 06:20.129
You know, I have to admit,
when you first moved in with Colin,

06:20.213 --> 06:22.298
it was kind of a curveball for me.

06:22.382 --> 06:27.011
But over the years, seeing how much
you two love each other, well…

06:27.720 --> 06:28.554
Thanks, Dad.

06:28.638 --> 06:33.476
FYI, a curveball is a baseball pitch that
doesn't come at you the way you expect.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.353
Good evening!

06:35.436 --> 06:37.313
In honor of Colin's big night,

06:37.397 --> 06:40.817
Michael asked if Marc and I could
come up with some kind of musical tribute.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.694
Apparently, Michael thinks
because we won a couple of Tonys,

06:43.778 --> 06:45.738
we can whip up a new tune in no time.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.824
-And he was right!

07:18.312 --> 07:19.188
Everybody!

07:38.624 --> 07:41.252
Oh my God, where did you buy those abs?

07:44.672 --> 07:46.299
-Would you like a drink? Cheers.
-Hey.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.009
-Oh--
-I really need to talk to--

07:50.761 --> 07:52.180
-Now the toast!
-I--

07:52.263 --> 07:54.182
Don't be nervous. You're gonna be great!

07:54.265 --> 07:55.766
-What could be--
-I…

07:59.979 --> 08:03.107
Everyone. Hi. Yes, your attention, please.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.359
-Ah…

08:05.985 --> 08:07.320
I… I…

08:07.403 --> 08:08.446
Hah.

08:08.529 --> 08:09.530
Uh…

08:09.614 --> 08:11.115
Thank you so much for coming

08:11.199 --> 08:14.827
and for keeping
our little surprise a secret.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.787
I know how hard it is

08:16.871 --> 08:19.248
to pretend like everything's normal
when you're…

08:20.124 --> 08:21.584
quietly plotting away.

08:24.712 --> 08:27.465
But we did it for our beloved Colin.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.092
My partner.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.261
My best friend.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.558
My everything for the past 17 years.

08:39.435 --> 08:42.522
I remember saying to him
after our first date,

08:43.981 --> 08:45.858
"What if we just found each other?"

08:46.692 --> 08:48.778
Because the knowing was that

08:49.570 --> 08:51.280
fast, that strong.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.117
And I just…

08:57.453 --> 08:58.287
I can't…

09:01.541 --> 09:03.376
imagine my life without you.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.756
It just doesn't make sense.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.552
So…

09:14.303 --> 09:15.388
…to you, Colin.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.890
I love you.

09:19.850 --> 09:20.810
I love you.

09:22.770 --> 09:23.688
I love you.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.160
Have a good 'un.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.162
Thanks for coming.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.582
Night-night. Come on, we need to take off.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.426
So can we finally talk?

09:54.385 --> 09:57.305
I intended to talk to you at the dinner
I thought we were having.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.932
I wasn't counting
on a massive surprise party.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.726
Uh, yeah. You're welcome.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.313
And by the way,
"Surprise, happy birthday,"

10:05.396 --> 10:08.774
is a lot more fun than,
"Surprise, I moved out."

10:08.858 --> 10:10.443
-You know, it's late. I gotta go.
-Just--

10:10.526 --> 10:12.069
Wait. What do you mean, "go"?

10:12.570 --> 10:15.865
Pl-- Colin, you can't just blindside me
like this and then not talk about it.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.409
Is there someone else?

10:18.492 --> 10:21.621
No. I just need some time on my own
to figure things out.

10:22.121 --> 10:26.250
After 17 years,
you don't "figure things out" alone

10:26.334 --> 10:27.877
in another apartment

10:27.960 --> 10:30.421
with the Hermès towels and the wine!

10:30.504 --> 10:32.381
I only took things that I paid for myself.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.343
Yes, towels we're not allowed to use
and wine that we can't drink.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.011
What is the point?
I never understood.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.472
Stop making this about you.
It's not all about you.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.848
No, it is about us!

10:40.931 --> 10:44.518
You're making
an "us" decision all by yourself.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.020
Where is this apartment anyway?

10:46.103 --> 10:48.314
-And who did you use to find it?
-Doesn't matter.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.565
The hell it doesn't!

10:49.649 --> 10:52.985
There is a realtor in this city,
a person I probably know,

10:53.069 --> 10:55.988
who knew that you were leaving me
before I did?

10:56.072 --> 10:59.450
Can you get
how humiliating that is for me?

10:59.533 --> 11:00.368
You see?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.745
Now it's all back to you again.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.121
Oh--

11:05.831 --> 11:07.041
Fuck that!

11:08.876 --> 11:09.794
You cannot--

11:11.712 --> 11:12.546
Are you seri--

11:14.715 --> 11:15.549
Are you--

11:46.497 --> 11:48.457
Come on, dots.

11:53.629 --> 11:57.925
<i>It's going to be quite mild today</i>
<i>with partly cloudy skies and a high of 67.</i>

11:58.008 --> 12:00.636
<i>Out on Long Island,</i>
<i>it's going to be a bit more brisk,</i>

12:00.720 --> 12:03.055
<i>with winds gusting up to 15 miles an hour.</i>

12:03.139 --> 12:05.015
<i>-But looking ahead to the weekend…</i>

12:05.099 --> 12:07.184
<i>…it's going to be absolutely gorgeous.</i>

12:29.498 --> 12:32.960
Soaring more than 1,000 feet
over Bryant Park,

12:33.043 --> 12:36.672
Verge New York will redefine
the luxury condo experience.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.424
Mm.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.717
At 4,000 a square foot,

12:39.800 --> 12:42.845
you'd think they'd serve
somethin' better than pigs in a blanket.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.388
I had eight.

12:45.681 --> 12:48.476
-Amazing party. Did you even sleep?
-Not really.

12:48.559 --> 12:52.313
Well, you totally pulled it off.
I could tell Colin was really surprised.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.064
Not as surprised as I was.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.318
Right before the party,
he told me he was leaving me.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.569
-Get out!
-Yeah.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.321
He kind of did that too.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.658
So…
You think there's someone else?

13:05.201 --> 13:08.245
Uh… He says no, but I don't know.
I don't know anything.

13:08.746 --> 13:13.542
Except that while I was planning
his party, he was plotting his escape.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.504
Colin seemed like he was havin'
such a good time. He even kissed me.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.006
I'm sure. Just like
Michael Corleone kissed Fredo.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.677
Why are you so calm? I'd be in bed,
calling lawyers or interviewing hitmen.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.223
No, because he's made
an appointment for us with a therapist,

13:27.306 --> 13:28.349
which is a big deal.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.560
Colin doesn't like to talk.
He likes to sweep shit under the rug.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.479
He's so out of touch with his feelings.

13:33.562 --> 13:37.525
I just don't believe that he's going
to throw away 17 years together

13:37.608 --> 13:40.611
just because he's having a dark moment
about his freaking birthday.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.866
-Can I tell you what I'm thinking?
-Yes, please.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.536
This might be the building
to get the Warnocks

13:48.619 --> 13:50.788
to finally sell their place on Fifth
and move downtown.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.675
-Seriously?

14:02.758 --> 14:04.468
Moved out, out?

14:05.177 --> 14:07.763
So, I just heard
from the director of the Hirshhorn

14:07.847 --> 14:10.599
that they want two pieces from this show.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.478
But how can I be happy about anything
after hearing about you and Colin?

14:14.562 --> 14:17.147
I don't know.
But somehow, you're pullin' it off.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.568
There's no story here, boys. We're taking
some time off to figure things out.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.028
Relationships hit potholes. We'll be fine.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.740
Good. Because trust me, you do not
wanna be gay and single in this town.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.077
-At our age, you're invisible.
-I think it gets better with age.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.582
The number of young guys who wanna
hook up with an older man is ridiculous.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.166
That's because you're on TV.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.295
Every shallow twink in the city
wants to be with someone on TV.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.756
-Don't give yourself too much credit.
-I've seen your profile on Grindr.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.426
Nobody wants to fuck
a post of a Donald Judd stack.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.678
That's my Instagram profile, dummy.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.389
I'm not on Grindr.
It's nothing but bottoms.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.600
And tops who are also bottoms.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.268
Being single's an attitude.

14:54.351 --> 14:58.063
The minute you are desperate
for a relationship, never gonna find one.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.108
-Mm.
-Well, Michael did. He hated being single.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.068
We would go dancing and to bars.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.279
All he wanted
was someone to settle down with.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.780
I was not desperate.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.491
Umm… Okay, you were focused.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.203
I was not… Okay, yeah, I didn't love
being single. All those planks.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.455
Exactly.

15:14.955 --> 15:18.542
-So whatever it is, work it out.
-Yeah.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.462
Colin's a wonderful guy,
and I believe in the two of you.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.088
-Hear hear.

15:23.672 --> 15:24.548
Thanks, guys.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.477
-Any word from Colin?
-I'm sorry. He's a no-show.

15:37.061 --> 15:41.815
Don't worry about it.
I am sitting you with Claire Lewis.

15:42.316 --> 15:46.028
She and her husband are major league
art collectors. They're getting a divorce.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.698
They're selling everything,
including… the apartment.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.533
You're welcome.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.952
Ooh. Claire!

15:54.286 --> 15:55.579
-Hi.
-Hello.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.747
Mwah!

15:56.830 --> 15:58.874
Claire, this is my dear friend

15:58.958 --> 16:01.543
-and fabulous real estate agent…
-Oh!

16:01.627 --> 16:02.503
…Michael Lawson.

16:02.586 --> 16:06.423
Michael, Claire Lewis,
collector extraordinaire. Enjoy.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.758
Interesting.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.637
This is my first time in years
at the singles table.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.097
Oh! Uh…

16:13.180 --> 16:14.181
I'm not single.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.017
Oh.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.354
I'm sorry. I must have misunderstood.
I was sure Stanley--

16:20.437 --> 16:22.523
No, my partner just couldn't make it.
That's all.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.025
I'm just single for the night.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.159
Oh, and my soon-to-be ex-husband
is in a hurry to sell the apartment.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.746
He says it's a white elephant. He doesn't
want the headache in a dicey market.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.958
No, no, no. No, no. You cannot let him
do that. I know that building.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.044
Anything with a terrace
is extremely desirable.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.548
Well, I guess that makes me
extremely desirable adjacent.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.549
-Oh!

16:48.632 --> 16:51.677
Which, trust me, is the best thing
I've heard in a long time.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.929
Oh, come on. You're fabulous.

16:58.225 --> 17:01.937
Well, we haven't picked a broker yet,
so you're welcome to come and take a look.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.356
How about tomorrow?

17:05.941 --> 17:08.819
Sure. Be there at 11 o'clock.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.739
But FYI, you've got competition.

17:12.614 --> 17:13.741
I love a challenge.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.577
Well.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.412
Cheers.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.297
Hey, Suzanne, I'm close. Are you here?

17:30.716 --> 17:31.717
What? How far?

17:33.510 --> 17:35.179
Well, hurry up.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.642
Come on, you know
how much this listing means.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.352
Michael Lawson to see Claire Lewis.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.105
I don't wanna fuck it up
because one of us didn't prepare

17:45.189 --> 17:48.692
for the slim possibility
of New York City traffic!

17:49.985 --> 17:52.446
-Is everything all right, sir?
-Yeah. I'm sorry.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.824
-It's just been a rough couple of--
-Elevator to the penthouse.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.659
Okay. Thanks, thanks.

17:59.328 --> 18:03.373
Hello, Michael. What was all that shouting
on the phone downstairs?

18:03.457 --> 18:06.752
-What? How did--
-We have very proper doormen.

18:06.835 --> 18:10.089
A raised voice, the use of profanity.
It sets off alarm bells.

18:10.881 --> 18:14.927
After all,
one's ears are not garbage cans.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.639
Just FYI, if there's a next time.
Please do come in.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.775
Oh my God.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.735
This is…

18:33.070 --> 18:36.156
I feel like
I'm in one of those 1930s movies

18:36.240 --> 18:38.492
where the Depression is happening outside,

18:38.575 --> 18:41.161
but up here, it's just Fred Astaire,

18:41.245 --> 18:43.247
and cocktails, and soirées.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.166
Well, I'm afraid there's been
a good amount of depression happening

18:46.250 --> 18:47.918
up here as well.

18:48.001 --> 18:51.088
That tends to be your emotional state
when your husband of 28 years,

18:51.171 --> 18:54.258
with whom you've raised two children
in this apartment,

18:54.341 --> 18:57.928
comes home one day and tells you
you're not fun anymore and moves out.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.640
-So it was just like that? No warning?
-None!

19:01.723 --> 19:04.268
Goes off to work in the morning.
"What do you want for dinner?"

19:04.351 --> 19:07.813
Came back, ruined my life, and then took
a few things to his new apartment.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.024
So he'd already rented an apartment?

19:11.733 --> 19:13.569
I'm not fun?

19:14.194 --> 19:17.239
He misses his poo window in the morning,
his whole day is shot.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.200
You live with a person for decades,
you think you know them,

19:20.284 --> 19:23.120
and then one day,
you find out this can happen.

19:24.955 --> 19:29.418
Was he, you know, in hindsight,
showing signs of unhappiness

19:29.501 --> 19:31.795
that now you go,
"That should have tipped me off?"

19:31.879 --> 19:34.840
No, nothing! Completely normal.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.885
And then all of a sudden,
the fat fuck says, "I need some space."

19:38.510 --> 19:40.596
I didn't understand
what he was talking about.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.890
There's 5,000 square feet
in this apartment

19:42.973 --> 19:44.474
and a home in Amagansett.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.685
How much more space do you need?

19:46.768 --> 19:49.313
And then he has the nerve to tell me

19:49.396 --> 19:51.565
I'm not being supportive enough
about this.

19:52.608 --> 19:56.778
So he was asking you to be more positive
about his need for space?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.238
Can you even imagine?

19:58.322 --> 20:02.701
He's leaving me, and I'm supposed to be
all sympathetic and encouraging about it?

20:02.784 --> 20:04.661
He can go suck a dick. No offense.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.664
Please.
But back to the space thing.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.834
Was he saying
that you guys could maybe work it out

20:10.918 --> 20:13.378
if you understood his need for space?

20:13.462 --> 20:15.589
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

20:15.672 --> 20:18.467
Start all over again at my age?

20:18.550 --> 20:23.180
What if I never have sex again?
What if I end up paying for companionship?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.515
Oh, I don't think…

20:25.599 --> 20:27.851
Uh, you're a very attractive--

20:27.935 --> 20:30.771
Don't kid yourself!
I know women like that. Men too.

20:30.854 --> 20:34.983
Everybody wants young, young, young!
No one is looking for someone my age.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.361
I'm going to die alone.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.863
How did this fucking happen to me?

20:44.409 --> 20:48.622
How in the fuck did you get up here?
You are supposed to be announced.

20:52.709 --> 20:53.961
Thank you for coming.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.255
We'll be in touch.

21:01.718 --> 21:06.014
Oh, and, Michael, don't forget
our little talk about lobby etiquette.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.397
What is lobby etiquette?

21:13.480 --> 21:16.024
It's about yelling and cursing
in the lobby.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.485
Apparently, all bets are off
once you get upstairs.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.571
Well, she did seem to respond to us,

21:21.655 --> 21:24.283
despite whatever the hell was goin' on
before I got here.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.536
She started talking about her husband
leaving her, and it spooked me.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.663
Our situations are not dissimilar.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.334
Ah! Tyler Hawkins.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.170
Oh my God, déjà vu!

21:37.254 --> 21:39.881
The last time I ran into you guys
was at the Beresford.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.134
Sorry. Oh…

21:43.385 --> 21:44.678
Mm.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.764
-I assume you're here to see Claire Lewis.
-Oh! Love Claire.

21:47.848 --> 21:51.310
Friends with my parents.
So sad about her and Henry.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.561
Mm.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.982
By the way, there's a listing coming up
at 1041 Fifth. Jackie O's building.

21:57.065 --> 22:00.610
I went to Collegiate
with her grandson John. Dreamy.

22:00.694 --> 22:05.615
So I know the tenants. Just didn't want
you guys to get your hopes up.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.163
-Shit.
-It's not over.

22:11.246 --> 22:12.372
We still have a…

22:13.040 --> 22:13.874
Shit!

22:22.674 --> 22:23.675
Before we dig in,

22:24.343 --> 22:25.177
um…

22:25.260 --> 22:29.806
I would just like to say thank you
for giving us the opportunity

22:29.890 --> 22:33.352
to take this journey of communication
while living apart

22:33.435 --> 22:35.604
and for making the appointment
with Dr. Sweeny.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.439
You're welcome.

22:37.522 --> 22:41.276
And to demonstrate
my support for your process,

22:41.360 --> 22:44.196
I bought you a housewarming present

22:44.279 --> 22:47.282
for your new apartment
in the undisclosed location.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.451
Thank you. That wasn't necessary.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.791
Bet it's in Williamsburg or DUMBO.
He's always romanticized Brooklyn.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.086
Am I warm?

23:00.087 --> 23:03.256
Well, it sounds like Michael
has a lot of questions, Colin.

23:04.674 --> 23:07.761
As I understand it, you haven't
told Michael where you're living?

23:07.844 --> 23:10.847
He never told me he was leaving.
I thought we'd been robbed.

23:11.598 --> 23:14.184
If I had told you before,
you would've talked me out of it.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.936
This was the only thing I could do

23:16.019 --> 23:17.813
to give us a chance
of dealing with our issues.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.815
Great. And I'm all for it.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.775
You took a brave step.

23:21.858 --> 23:26.071
Even though it might have been interpreted
as a passive-aggressive sucker punch.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.573
Kind of like the surprise party
you threw me?

23:29.282 --> 23:32.035
For a birthday I told you
I had no intention of broadcasting,

23:32.119 --> 23:35.414
where everything had the number 50 on it,
including the urinal cakes.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.540
Oh.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.166
God is in the details.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.961
-I was celebrating you.
-Without my consent.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.462
Then I apologize.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.216
That is kind of
the definition of a surprise party.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.970
But that's not why you moved out.

23:51.012 --> 23:51.888
No.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.808
Well, gentlemen,
there is a lot to unpack here.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.813
I am so glad that we're here
to focus on what's important.

24:00.981 --> 24:04.985
I wanna take this opportunity
to really listen to you.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.698
I feel like we have this fantastic life.
We have so much to be grateful for.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.700
And maybe a lot of it goes unexamined.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.286
Do we need to explore some of that?
Absolutely.

24:14.369 --> 24:17.330
But that is why we're here, right?
So let's do it. Let's focus.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.624
Roll up our sleeves and get to it.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.002
-Our time is almost up.
-Oh.

24:22.085 --> 24:24.254
But I see many positives here.

24:24.337 --> 24:27.132
Two men looking for a way forward,

24:27.215 --> 24:32.012
prepared to do the sometimes painful
hard work that it entails.

24:32.637 --> 24:33.722
I definitely am.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.182
Yeah.

24:42.772 --> 24:46.151
Uh, hey, don't forget
the Jonathans' bris is at 5:00.

24:46.234 --> 24:49.321
-Do you wanna go together?
-I'm late for a meeting. See you there?

24:49.404 --> 24:50.405
-Sure.
-Okay.

24:52.782 --> 24:54.784
Shall we schedule our next appointment?

24:55.452 --> 24:56.411
Same time next week?

24:56.495 --> 24:57.787
-Works for me.
-Great.

25:05.545 --> 25:08.423
Hey, um, between you and me,
how do you think that went?

25:09.549 --> 25:11.676
I think that was a terrific first step.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.055
Long-term relationships can stagnate

25:15.138 --> 25:17.307
without the people in them
even realizing it.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.269
But with counseling,
they can fall in love all over again.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.398
Oh no.

25:26.691 --> 25:27.943
He forgot his gift.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.528
Don't read into it.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.577
-Can you believe this apartment?
-I found it for them.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.996
It's a rental,
but you didn't hear it from me.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.874
I remember Hell's Kitchen when
you couldn't walk west of Ninth Avenue

25:42.958 --> 25:44.042
without getting knifed.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.378
Now it's Chelsea with better gays.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.296
-Progress.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.215
Invite said no gifts.

25:50.298 --> 25:52.592
It's for Colin,
something for his new apartment.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.512
The man leaves you cold,
and you buy him a present?

25:55.595 --> 25:58.181
What's in there? Brass knuckles
to punch you in the face with?

25:58.265 --> 26:01.184
He's not wrong. Play hard to get
if you want to get him hard again.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.520
You should embroider that on a pillow.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.438
Look, guys, I am supporting his journey.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.149
And I am not taking relationship advice
from either of you.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.193
Your personal lives speak for themselves.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.445
Hurt people hurt people.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.906
We said no gifts!

26:14.990 --> 26:17.701
-Oh, but if you insist--
-Oh, this isn't for the baby.

26:17.784 --> 26:18.743
-I'm sorry.
-Oh.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.079
-Where's Colin?
-Um, on his way.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.373
-Oh.
-Have you seen the hot mohel?

26:23.456 --> 26:25.083
He's straight. Don't get any ideas.

26:25.667 --> 26:29.379
Relax. I'm not getting any ideas
about your hot, straight mohel.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.092
-He's totally gonna hit on him.
-Yeah.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.510
<i>-Mijo.</i>
-Yes, Mom?

26:35.594 --> 26:38.972
Here's something I never thought I'd say.
You're running low on gefilte fish.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.265
I'll tell the caterer.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.392
It's my first bris.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.520
I'm going to take one last look
at my grandson's peepee

26:45.604 --> 26:46.980
before the disfiguring.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.065
Mazel tov.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.986
-Tell Colin to get here. We're ready.
-What would you like us to do?

26:53.069 --> 26:55.280
Stand next to me
and catch me in case I faint.

26:57.532 --> 26:58.450
You see that guy?

26:59.534 --> 27:01.286
-Mount Baldy?
-Yeah.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.747
We hooked up three years ago, twice.

27:03.830 --> 27:07.083
I said hi when I came in.
He said, "Nice to meet you."

27:08.209 --> 27:11.421
I don't even know why I bother
scooping my bagel anymore.

27:23.850 --> 27:24.768
Is everything okay?

27:25.393 --> 27:27.979
-We're ready to start. Is Colin--
-Um, he has a…

27:28.855 --> 27:29.981
A work emergency.

27:30.607 --> 27:31.441
So he…

27:32.776 --> 27:33.693
Excuse me.

28:00.970 --> 28:03.723
-Oh my God, did you just throw up?
-Yeah.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.558
-So that's your secret.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.644
Stupid me. I could never learn how.

28:44.764 --> 28:48.184
Hello.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.563
I know where Colin's living.

28:51.646 --> 28:53.314
And who he's living with.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.152
Can you meet me for a drink?
