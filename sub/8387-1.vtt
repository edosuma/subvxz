03:37.105 --> 03:39.571
Wake up, sleepyhead. It's sunset.

03:46.114 --> 03:48.478
<i>Board of Education Chairman...</i>

03:49.751 --> 03:53.150
- Good evening, Sebastian.
- Good evening, Countess.

04:08.069 --> 04:09.761
Austrian peasant.

04:14.376 --> 04:15.841
Early 1700s...

04:16.244 --> 04:17.675
O-positive.

04:17.879 --> 04:19.344
Very nice...

04:20.281 --> 04:22.851
but not vintage,
and certainly not virgin.

04:22.951 --> 04:26.021
Virgin blood isn't easy to come by
these days, Countess.

04:26.121 --> 04:27.848
You're telling me.

04:31.893 --> 04:34.894
How many days left
till Halloween, Sebastian?

04:35.964 --> 04:39.727
Little more than a week, Countess.
I told you not to worry.

04:40.001 --> 04:41.534
Not to worry?

04:42.170 --> 04:43.635
How amusing.

04:44.539 --> 04:47.809
You're not the one that has to have
the virgin blood of a young man...

04:47.909 --> 04:51.775
not once, but three times
before All Hallows' Eve.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.013
Not to worry?

04:54.382 --> 04:58.077
Being a vampire in the 20th century
is a nightmare!

05:05.126 --> 05:09.026
Did we get up on the wrong side
of the coffin this evening?

05:16.004 --> 05:18.163
Must be the delegation from below.

05:22.110 --> 05:24.178
You, wipe your feet.

05:26.848 --> 05:31.112
After 120 years, you still have
Georgia clay on your boots.

05:32.387 --> 05:36.150
You're a long way from Covent Garden.
Your report?

05:36.257 --> 05:38.960
Countess, we've been all over
this metropolis.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.162
With nothing to show for it?

05:41.262 --> 05:44.299
Do you realize that it's less
than 10 days until Halloween?

05:44.399 --> 05:49.300
Times have changed. When you found me,
it was 1864. Virginity was still popular.

05:50.972 --> 05:53.336
Stop being so damned negative.

05:54.109 --> 05:56.411
There must be a virgin out there.
Find him!

05:56.511 --> 05:58.780
Unless the Countess gets
what she must have...

05:58.880 --> 06:02.541
you lose your refuge and her protection.
Is that clear?

06:03.852 --> 06:07.046
The closest we've come so far
is an 11-year-old.

06:07.188 --> 06:08.990
Don't be disgusting.

06:09.090 --> 06:13.024
No more excuses! She's heard them all.
She wants action.

06:13.595 --> 06:15.458
And she wants it now.

06:19.167 --> 06:22.134
Get out there and find me a virgin!

06:25.106 --> 06:27.299
I want to, I really do.

06:28.276 --> 06:29.843
Robin, please!

06:30.278 --> 06:33.870
Mark, we've been through this sex thing
a million times.

06:34.249 --> 06:36.817
Halfway through it a million times.

06:37.619 --> 06:40.288
It's what people do
when they are in love.

06:40.388 --> 06:42.424
It's natural. It's right.

06:42.524 --> 06:46.287
It's not natural for me
to do it in a car.

06:47.662 --> 06:49.857
What about an ice-cream truck?

07:12.153 --> 07:13.311
What?

07:13.421 --> 07:15.489
Do you have a creamsicle?

07:16.257 --> 07:19.349
Take a hike!
We're closed for renovations.

07:41.649 --> 07:42.651
Jeez.

07:42.751 --> 07:44.944
Sorry. I'll put it in third.

07:50.925 --> 07:52.458
Look, Mark...

07:52.660 --> 07:54.990
I want to. I really do.

07:55.797 --> 07:57.990
But I want it to be special.

08:12.413 --> 08:13.878
Sorry.

08:16.751 --> 08:18.478
Please understand.

08:23.424 --> 08:24.582
Shit.

09:07.669 --> 09:09.838
Based on my broad
and varied experience...

09:09.938 --> 09:12.440
I'm telling you,
girls have a six-year cutoff time.

09:12.540 --> 09:16.542
If they haven't put out in the first
six years, they figure, "why bother?"

09:17.212 --> 09:20.315
No. She just thinks if it's good,
it can wait.

09:20.415 --> 09:24.173
Oh, yeah? Look at me.
I'm good. I can't wait.

09:28.089 --> 09:31.784
- You call that well-done? It's still meowing.
- It's burnt.

09:33.328 --> 09:36.197
I don't know. There's too much pressure
about getting laid.

09:36.297 --> 09:38.893
It's like taking a driver's test
for manhood.

09:39.901 --> 09:43.429
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

09:43.872 --> 09:47.203
Right now, I'm as close
to physical perfection as I'm gonna get.

09:47.609 --> 09:50.542
That's depressing. Really depressing.

09:51.279 --> 09:55.850
Sometimes I think I should just go out,
find some strange woman and get laid.

09:55.950 --> 09:59.747
Then I could go back to Robin
without all this pressure between us.

10:11.466 --> 10:13.295
Now that's a burger!

10:15.703 --> 10:17.939
We should check out
some of the bars in Hollywood.

10:18.039 --> 10:20.074
I don't want to do that.

10:20.174 --> 10:22.177
- That's where all the weirdoes are.
- Exactly.

10:22.277 --> 10:24.746
Because that's where all the action is.

10:24.846 --> 10:27.782
We might as well.
Nothing ever happens here.

10:27.882 --> 10:30.177
We live in a sexual wasteland.

10:30.385 --> 10:32.053
What if Robin finds out?

10:32.153 --> 10:34.414
Who's gonna tell her? Not me.

10:37.825 --> 10:40.161
Come on. I wouldn't say nothing.

10:40.261 --> 10:43.057
Not if she got down on her knees and...

10:45.400 --> 10:46.694
Get out!

13:38.673 --> 13:41.173
We'll have three beers, all around.

13:46.547 --> 13:47.773
Watch.

14:07.034 --> 14:08.431
Number 17.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.369
Hi there! Number 17?

14:14.909 --> 14:17.307
I'm Russ and I'm a Sagittarius.

14:17.678 --> 14:20.838
I enjoy surfing, candlelit dinners,
and Tolstoy.

14:22.583 --> 14:26.949
Look, I'm a mature person,
and you are a mature person, so...

14:28.489 --> 14:30.079
She said, "Come on over!"

14:31.392 --> 14:33.119
You got it, honey.

14:35.930 --> 14:37.497
Don't wait up.

14:44.672 --> 14:45.773
Hi there, Russ.

14:45.873 --> 14:47.770
- Hi.
- Sit down.

14:48.843 --> 14:52.936
A Sagittarius! Dynamite! I'm a Gemini.

14:53.414 --> 14:56.074
Hey, man, do you know what that means?

14:56.551 --> 14:57.879
Like H2O!

15:01.689 --> 15:03.256
Are you a guy?

15:04.659 --> 15:06.249
Does it matter?

15:11.132 --> 15:12.358
Sissy.

15:20.007 --> 15:23.311
Want to leave now? This place is stupid.

15:23.411 --> 15:26.173
Are you kidding? We haven't scored yet.

15:26.547 --> 15:29.207
Score? Not here, that's for sure.

15:29.917 --> 15:31.575
Look around you.

15:31.752 --> 15:34.155
Yuppie city.

15:34.255 --> 15:36.448
You got it. We don't belong.

15:41.495 --> 15:43.028
Studs "R" Us.

15:44.232 --> 15:46.061
Number four at the bar.

15:50.238 --> 15:52.932
Am I sitting in the middle,
wearing a red tie?

15:54.875 --> 15:57.411
She wants you to have a drink with her.

15:57.511 --> 16:00.671
- He'll be right there.
- All right, move it, man!

16:01.082 --> 16:02.950
I don't feel good about this.

16:03.050 --> 16:05.914
Come on, go for it. Live dangerously...

16:06.287 --> 16:07.354
stud!

16:07.455 --> 16:09.113
All right. Okay.

16:09.290 --> 16:10.584
Come on.

16:28.476 --> 16:29.873
Go for it!

16:53.968 --> 16:56.559
Hello, tall, dark and handsome.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.229
Me?

17:01.008 --> 17:02.097
Hi.

17:02.843 --> 17:04.535
What's your name?

17:05.146 --> 17:06.974
Mark Kendall.

17:12.586 --> 17:14.517
Can I buy you a drink?

17:14.855 --> 17:18.049
I was hoping
you would share my champagne.

17:19.126 --> 17:20.454
Oh, yeah.

17:28.102 --> 17:29.499
What's your name?

17:30.104 --> 17:32.934
- Just call me "Countess."
<i>- "</i> Countess"?

17:35.776 --> 17:39.471
That's great. I like that.
I had a dog named King once.

17:50.925 --> 17:52.356
Thirty-two.

17:55.162 --> 17:56.764
Do you come here often?

17:56.864 --> 17:58.955
This is my first time.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.298
Beautiful. Great place.

18:08.376 --> 18:10.341
Do you come here a lot?

18:10.878 --> 18:12.969
Whenever I'm on the prowl.

18:18.352 --> 18:20.283
How old are you?

18:22.356 --> 18:24.117
Me? 21.

18:25.659 --> 18:27.317
How old are you?

18:27.762 --> 18:29.363
Older than you think.

18:29.463 --> 18:32.361
That's okay.
I look young for my age, too.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.164
People say I could pass for 18.

18:43.744 --> 18:45.146
...the horse threw me.

18:45.246 --> 18:48.042
Whore! Caught in the act, you pedophile!

18:49.417 --> 18:52.687
Why don't you sit down
so we can discuss this like mature...

18:52.787 --> 18:54.479
Shut up, scumbag!

18:56.757 --> 18:57.789
So...

18:58.058 --> 18:59.716
you're Chester!

19:02.163 --> 19:04.999
I think there's been
a little misunderstanding. I'm not...

19:05.099 --> 19:08.191
I wouldn't sit in the same room
with you, degenerate.

19:08.602 --> 19:11.339
- I'm Jamie...
- I wouldn't live in the same city!

19:11.439 --> 19:15.242
We just came here to get some girls tonight.
I mean, meet some girls.

19:15.342 --> 19:17.812
Mark's got an ice-cream truck,
and we came down.

19:17.912 --> 19:20.414
We heard this was
a swinging place, that's all.

19:20.514 --> 19:22.980
Figures. A kid! A degenerate kid!

19:23.150 --> 19:25.810
Pornographer! I've read your letters!

19:28.522 --> 19:31.025
- I wouldn't.
- They're my friends.

19:31.125 --> 19:34.092
They can handle it.
Don't do anything rash.

19:37.398 --> 19:39.932
- You make me sick.
- Shut up, Harry.

19:40.034 --> 19:42.193
Filth! That's what this is.

19:44.004 --> 19:46.173
You slime, this is private!

19:46.273 --> 19:47.806
We better get out of here.

19:49.009 --> 19:50.978
How dare you write this filth
to my wife!

19:51.078 --> 19:53.848
This is a big misunderstanding.
I didn't write anything...

19:53.948 --> 19:57.108
- This is a big mistake on your part.
- He's got a gun!

19:58.886 --> 20:00.317
Oh, my God!

20:04.091 --> 20:07.217
Don't hang up. It happens all the time.

20:07.495 --> 20:08.823
Let's go.

20:21.475 --> 20:24.738
Neither one of us
can afford to spend the night in jail.

20:26.213 --> 20:27.803
Countess! Sir!

20:30.784 --> 20:33.020
Wait, my truck! My ice-cream truck!

20:33.120 --> 20:35.556
I know where it's parked.
Give me the key.

20:35.656 --> 20:38.452
You don't want to end up in the slammer.

20:46.634 --> 20:49.965
- Daddy hurt his parts.
- Daddy was bad.

20:56.977 --> 20:59.375
Is that a new kind of choke hold?

21:03.050 --> 21:05.141
See, I told you we'd get lucky.

22:06.614 --> 22:10.172
Is there anything you need?
Food? Drinks?

22:11.018 --> 22:12.244
A bib?

22:13.320 --> 22:15.911
Thank you, no, Sebastian.

22:35.242 --> 22:37.105
This is a nice house.

22:37.811 --> 22:40.381
Don't see a lot of mansions
where I live.

22:40.481 --> 22:41.649
We just moved in.

22:41.749 --> 22:45.842
The previous owner slaughtered his family,
and then hung himself.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.144
You must've got it cheap.

22:48.288 --> 22:50.049
Except for the cleaning bill.

22:50.324 --> 22:51.725
May I get you a drink?

22:51.825 --> 22:54.052
I have to ask you something.

22:54.228 --> 22:56.023
I was wondering...

22:57.364 --> 22:59.227
Are you a prostitute?

23:02.770 --> 23:05.168
I'm whatever you want me to be.

23:05.973 --> 23:08.234
Good, because I only have $5.

23:25.392 --> 23:26.982
What would you like?

23:28.062 --> 23:29.720
The same as you.

23:41.075 --> 23:42.403
Try this.

23:43.477 --> 23:47.014
I'm gonna slip into something
a little more comfortable.

23:47.114 --> 23:49.205
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

24:23.150 --> 24:25.718
Okay, Sebastian. Out of the closet.

24:27.554 --> 24:30.316
I came out of the closet centuries ago.

24:30.457 --> 24:32.821
Very amusing. Come on, help me.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.102
Make me lovely.

24:42.202 --> 24:44.202
Have I ever failed you?

24:47.775 --> 24:50.639
- How's my hair?
- Like golden wheat.

24:51.945 --> 24:53.239
My eyes?

24:53.547 --> 24:55.205
Bright as Venus.

24:55.916 --> 24:59.417
I'm so excited.
It's as if I were young again.

25:00.387 --> 25:04.719
And so you shall be, lovey.
I told you not to worry.

25:43.797 --> 25:45.728
I see you've made yourself at home.

25:46.433 --> 25:48.125
That's very nice.

25:48.368 --> 25:52.268
Did you... Did they do that
over at the shopping mall?

25:52.773 --> 25:53.862
No.

25:55.275 --> 25:58.105
That was done a long time ago in Europe.

25:59.379 --> 26:01.344
Why don't you sit here?

26:02.149 --> 26:03.944
Sure.

26:16.763 --> 26:19.457
What do you do for a living?

26:20.100 --> 26:22.134
I go to school. College.

26:23.403 --> 26:26.301
I'm studying to be
an electrical engineer.

26:26.473 --> 26:28.734
Fascinating.

26:29.710 --> 26:32.279
- My field is nuclear physics.
- Really?

26:32.379 --> 26:35.039
I'm working on the acid rain problem.

26:35.782 --> 26:37.747
I love intelligent men.

26:39.419 --> 26:41.578
I guess they're okay.

26:49.997 --> 26:52.122
This place is great. I mean...

26:53.166 --> 26:55.791
It's beautiful. I mean, the...

26:56.870 --> 26:58.733
Who decorated it, anyway?

26:59.273 --> 27:00.499
I did.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.367
Great.

27:02.476 --> 27:04.737
Pillows, and everything. Nice.

27:05.545 --> 27:08.849
I mean, you know,
most people don't do things...

27:08.949 --> 27:10.983
and I think that...

27:11.585 --> 27:13.987
I mean, that's... They... You do.

27:14.087 --> 27:17.024
I mean, you do. You're a doer.

27:17.124 --> 27:19.385
I mean, you are a doer.

27:21.728 --> 27:23.193
You're a...

27:23.764 --> 27:25.532
Beautiful dress, too.

27:25.632 --> 27:27.768
I guess you made that yourself.

27:27.868 --> 27:30.537
I bet my mom would love
to borrow the pattern.

27:30.637 --> 27:33.205
I mean, my mom, she's great.

27:34.641 --> 27:36.844
I have a picture of my family
in my wallet.

27:36.944 --> 27:39.945
You might take a look,
as long as you're down there.

27:41.048 --> 27:44.379
There's some Life Savers
in that other pocket, there.

28:14.181 --> 28:17.217
What's he like?
Another crazy we don't need?

28:17.317 --> 28:18.418
Is he cute?

28:18.518 --> 28:20.754
Kind of a square. Sort of a jock.

28:20.854 --> 28:22.114
Enough!

28:22.389 --> 28:25.893
Our new young recruit
will be joining us for Halloween.

28:25.993 --> 28:29.196
Countess expects you all
to take him under your wings...

28:29.296 --> 28:32.399
and make him feel at home
for the first hundred years.

28:32.499 --> 28:33.934
You got that?

28:34.034 --> 28:36.625
She found a virgin! We're home free.

28:38.472 --> 28:40.374
I remember when I met the Countess.

28:40.474 --> 28:43.338
The day she bit me
was the sweetest day of my young life.

28:44.344 --> 28:46.935
There's an inch of dust under there.

28:56.323 --> 28:58.125
How come he rates that deluxe job?

28:58.225 --> 29:00.054
These are the 1980s.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.151
Not the Age of Innocence.

29:04.898 --> 29:07.364
A young man needs plenty of room.

29:08.635 --> 29:12.398
Sunrise in an hour.
I suggest that you all...

29:13.006 --> 29:14.698
get an early day.

29:31.091 --> 29:33.819
- Good day, Sebastian.
- Good day.

29:34.361 --> 29:37.624
Good night, Sebastian.

29:57.017 --> 29:58.516
He's still asleep.

30:00.587 --> 30:02.018
How was he?

30:02.589 --> 30:03.986
Delicious.

30:04.157 --> 30:06.521
Are you positive he's a virgin?

30:06.993 --> 30:11.393
I haven't had anything this pure
since the Vienna Boys' Choir hit town.

30:12.365 --> 30:14.990
Just make sure he doesn't slip away.

30:15.769 --> 30:17.564
He won't escape me.

30:18.205 --> 30:19.706
What'll we do with him?

30:19.806 --> 30:22.966
We can't very well
put him down with the others yet.

30:23.076 --> 30:26.179
Heavens, no. Let him go home
and build up his strength.

30:26.279 --> 30:28.643
Tired blood is of no use to me.

30:46.766 --> 30:48.731
Are you feeling better?

30:51.004 --> 30:53.800
Sebastian brought you some orange juice.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.505
Sir.

31:05.485 --> 31:06.882
Thank you.

31:09.756 --> 31:12.791
I'll just go check
on the gentleman's truck.

31:28.975 --> 31:30.565
What happened?

31:31.111 --> 31:33.179
Do you remember anything?

31:34.214 --> 31:35.747
Not much.

31:36.683 --> 31:38.751
I had the weirdest dream.

31:40.053 --> 31:42.923
You know those little packets
of fresh fruit juice...

31:43.023 --> 31:47.492
made out of tin foil, where you stick
little straws in them to open them?

31:50.530 --> 31:53.394
I think I dreamt
that I was one of those.

31:56.069 --> 31:58.103
What did happen, anyway?

32:02.676 --> 32:04.403
Let's just say...

32:05.078 --> 32:07.009
you earned your juice.

32:08.081 --> 32:10.376
- I did?
- You certainly did.

32:10.884 --> 32:13.111
Really? That's great.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.282
I don't believe it. It finally happened.

32:16.957 --> 32:18.547
Did I enjoy it?

32:29.069 --> 32:31.763
We'll be seeing each other again soon?

32:33.707 --> 32:34.865
Yeah.

32:37.777 --> 32:39.346
I have a bit of a problem.

32:39.446 --> 32:41.309
- A problem?
- Yeah.

32:44.317 --> 32:46.749
See, I'm sort of committed...

32:47.187 --> 32:49.255
to this really nice girl.

32:51.958 --> 32:53.160
I don't mind.

32:53.260 --> 32:55.658
I've often been the other woman.

32:56.463 --> 32:58.724
That's real unselfish of you.

32:58.999 --> 33:01.397
Tell you what, I'll be in touch.

33:04.904 --> 33:06.437
Later, blood.

33:16.616 --> 33:19.014
Start your day off with a smile.

33:21.154 --> 33:22.846
How sweet of you.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.361
Drive carefully.

33:28.461 --> 33:31.587
Remember, part of you belongs to me now.

33:31.931 --> 33:34.124
I'll see you in your dreams.

33:34.868 --> 33:36.299
Sure thing.

34:16.676 --> 34:18.641
Rare hamburger, please.

34:20.045 --> 34:21.773
Very rare, please.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.444
Can I have one of those uncooked ones?

34:34.561 --> 34:35.786
Right.

34:46.639 --> 34:48.366
Hey, stud.

34:50.810 --> 34:55.014
What happened to you guys Saturday night?
I called you Sunday, but you were out.

34:55.114 --> 34:57.117
It was a total disaster.

34:57.217 --> 35:00.343
I don't know.
The strip search was kind of fun.

35:00.754 --> 35:03.982
But, hey, how about you?
Did you go for the pokey?

35:04.991 --> 35:06.893
I don't want to talk about it.

35:06.993 --> 35:09.391
You did it with her, didn't you?

35:10.296 --> 35:13.854
- I guess.
- Jesus, God, those breasts!

35:15.568 --> 35:20.002
Has it changed you any? I mean,
do you feel more manly or mature?

35:20.907 --> 35:25.211
It was all a big mistake. I was so drunk,
I don't remember much, you know.

35:25.311 --> 35:29.177
Come on! Tell us what happened.
Blow by beautiful blow!

35:29.649 --> 35:31.451
Did you undress her slowly...

35:31.551 --> 35:35.121
first baring her big,
luscious magoombas?

35:35.221 --> 35:37.524
Did she have any tattoos
or scars or anything?

35:37.624 --> 35:39.885
I told you, I don't remember!

35:41.161 --> 35:45.925
If you're so interested in my sexual failures,
why don't you go have a few of your own?

35:49.302 --> 35:51.131
Robin, wait a second.

35:52.739 --> 35:56.297
Where'd you find her?
A 7-Eleven, a bowling alley?

36:03.750 --> 36:05.340
Wait up!

36:09.189 --> 36:11.958
Saturday night,
the three of us went up to Hollywood.

36:12.058 --> 36:13.126
Hollywood?

36:13.226 --> 36:15.317
It was Russ's stupid idea.

36:15.495 --> 36:20.294
You mean to tell me you went home with
a woman you met in a bar in Hollywood?

36:23.603 --> 36:24.727
And?

36:25.472 --> 36:27.574
I don't want to talk about it.

36:27.674 --> 36:29.743
You didn't make love to her?

36:29.843 --> 36:31.611
I think so. I don't know.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.947
You think so? You don't know?

36:34.047 --> 36:36.349
I remember she bit
the buttons off my shirt.

36:36.449 --> 36:39.386
The next thing I remember,
Sebastian bringing me orange juice.

36:39.486 --> 36:41.611
- Sebastian?
- The chauffeur.

36:42.422 --> 36:43.989
The chauffeur?

36:44.491 --> 36:46.292
Also like the butler, too.

36:46.392 --> 36:49.195
The butler? You mean
they all saw her bite your buttons?

36:49.295 --> 36:50.384
No!

36:50.630 --> 36:53.597
I mean, I don't know
what happened, exactly.

36:56.135 --> 36:59.839
I can't believe you'll throw away
our relationship on a one-night stand...

36:59.939 --> 37:03.309
with a chauffeur and a butler
and a slut who eats buttons.

37:03.409 --> 37:05.602
But you did, you really did.

37:07.180 --> 37:09.646
You can have your damn ring back!

37:10.250 --> 37:12.118
What am I supposed to do with it?

37:12.218 --> 37:14.081
Use your imagination.

37:32.405 --> 37:34.473
What are you doing?

37:34.641 --> 37:36.709
I'm dissecting this frog.

37:38.177 --> 37:40.905
But you're not a member of this class.

37:43.349 --> 37:44.643
I'm not?

37:44.951 --> 37:48.214
To my knowledge,
you have never attended lab before.

37:51.724 --> 37:53.257
You're right.

37:57.230 --> 37:58.627
I'm sorry.

38:04.671 --> 38:05.897
There.

38:07.340 --> 38:08.998
He's still good.

38:26.092 --> 38:27.557
You in here?

38:35.168 --> 38:36.257
Hi.

38:42.408 --> 38:44.511
What are you doing in there?

38:44.611 --> 38:46.144
Taking a nap.

38:49.949 --> 38:51.851
Are you feeling all right?

38:51.951 --> 38:53.916
Sure, I feel fine. Why?

38:56.222 --> 38:59.382
Your mother thinks
that you should see a doctor.

38:59.492 --> 39:01.227
You've been awful pale lately.

39:01.327 --> 39:03.196
We know you haven't been sleeping...

39:03.296 --> 39:06.661
because we can hear you
pacing the house all night.

39:06.833 --> 39:08.368
I'm fine. Really.

39:08.468 --> 39:09.802
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:09.902 --> 39:12.005
- I am a little tense.
- Tense?

39:12.105 --> 39:14.307
Robin and I
have been having some problems.

39:14.407 --> 39:17.533
I see. Everything is under control?

39:18.511 --> 39:19.669
Yeah.

39:23.816 --> 39:26.783
We'll see how you feel
in a couple of days.

39:28.421 --> 39:30.716
Just get a good night's sleep.

39:35.328 --> 39:36.759
In the bed.

39:37.630 --> 39:39.061
You know...

39:39.198 --> 39:41.459
make your mother feel better.

39:46.706 --> 39:48.535
I'll close the door.

42:42.915 --> 42:44.917
What has Mark done with his hair?

42:45.017 --> 42:47.286
- I think it's cute.
- It's weird.

42:47.386 --> 42:50.978
So, you and Mark
broke up for good this time?

42:51.824 --> 42:53.619
I don't believe it.

42:53.759 --> 42:56.419
I thought he was different
than other guys.

42:56.596 --> 42:59.732
- You know, more sensitive.
- I like a sensitive man.

42:59.832 --> 43:03.493
One who isn't afraid to show his emotions
or cry on your shoulder.

43:04.804 --> 43:06.166
Cracks me up.

43:06.606 --> 43:08.970
Can I talk to you for a second?

43:13.212 --> 43:16.516
I called you 10 times last night.
Why didn't you talk?

43:16.616 --> 43:18.911
There's nothing to talk about.

43:19.085 --> 43:22.421
You go out behind my back,
pick up a woman at a bar...

43:22.521 --> 43:25.057
go home with her,
and then pretend nothing happened.

43:25.157 --> 43:27.293
I don't want to talk about that.

43:27.393 --> 43:29.654
That's not fair. I was drunk.

43:30.062 --> 43:32.653
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

43:32.765 --> 43:35.197
You're not the Mark I thought I knew.

43:36.002 --> 43:37.570
Look at your hair, even.

43:37.670 --> 43:39.795
You look like Jerry Lewis.

43:39.939 --> 43:42.234
I thought I looked more like De Niro.

43:43.509 --> 43:45.099
It looks weird.

43:45.645 --> 43:49.511
I'm sorry, okay? It's not supposed
to be a fashion statement.

43:50.316 --> 43:52.884
I made a stupid mistake. I'm sorry.

43:53.519 --> 43:56.952
I'm a teenager.
I'm supposed to make stupid mistakes.

43:57.356 --> 44:00.254
I wouldn't try to hurt you.
You know that.

44:02.828 --> 44:04.764
I guess that's why I've been so mad.

44:04.864 --> 44:08.525
It's because I think
maybe you did what you did because of me.

44:09.201 --> 44:12.896
- Because I was making you so frustrated.
- You weren't.

44:14.073 --> 44:17.410
You were, but you're supposed to.
That's part of being a teenage girl.

44:17.510 --> 44:21.102
You're supposed to say no,
and I am supposed to get pissed off.

44:21.948 --> 44:24.312
You make it sound like the '50s.

44:26.419 --> 44:28.578
I guess I'm an old-fashioned guy.

44:30.356 --> 44:32.788
I really want to do it.

44:33.359 --> 44:37.486
That's what's so funny. I think
I want to do it as much as you do.

44:38.097 --> 44:40.028
There's no such thing.

44:40.199 --> 44:42.494
I just have to know I'm ready.

44:42.768 --> 44:45.666
And I'll know.
And I swear I'll tell you.

44:48.407 --> 44:49.531
God.

44:56.115 --> 44:58.911
Okay, Sebastian, out of the closet. Now.

44:59.952 --> 45:03.055
I thought I heard noises.
I was checking for prowlers.

45:03.155 --> 45:05.191
In a $100 scarf, perhaps?

45:05.291 --> 45:07.552
You bought it for $49.99.

45:10.563 --> 45:14.300
Do you mind if we don't go
barhopping tonight? I'm exhausted.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.832
I'm 390 years old.

45:17.269 --> 45:19.564
400, if you're a day.

45:19.739 --> 45:23.775
What's the difference? I'm so old,
I can't remember my own sign.

45:23.943 --> 45:28.673
You'll feel much more secure when Mark
has given you your second transfusion.

45:28.781 --> 45:30.872
Life used to be so simple.

45:31.417 --> 45:33.819
All one had to do to get a good meal...

45:33.919 --> 45:37.056
was go out in the field
and pick up a shepherd or two.

45:37.156 --> 45:39.859
Remember the look of terror
in a peasant's eyes...

45:39.959 --> 45:41.788
when you'd swoop down on him?

45:43.763 --> 45:45.228
And plagues.

45:46.198 --> 45:48.596
Whole cities infested with rats.

45:49.001 --> 45:51.797
People respected the power of a vampire.

45:54.807 --> 45:57.576
It's been three days.
Do you think we ought to go find Mark?

45:57.676 --> 46:00.370
Are you suggesting we invade suburbia?

46:01.247 --> 46:03.975
Bowling alleys, RVs...

46:04.450 --> 46:06.279
Chicken McNuggets?

46:34.847 --> 46:36.414
A laundromat?

46:36.682 --> 46:40.186
There's no better place
to pick up on lonely, bored women.

46:40.286 --> 46:44.623
You can always tell what you're getting into
by checking out their underwear first.

46:44.723 --> 46:48.027
I swear you guys are insane.
You've lost your minds.

46:48.127 --> 46:51.864
What you know about women would fill
an atom-sized piece of toilet paper.

46:51.964 --> 46:54.726
- Oh, yeah? We'll see.
- All right. We'll see.

46:55.201 --> 46:57.895
- See you later.
- Later. Come on, Jamie.

46:58.871 --> 47:00.165
Come on!

47:12.518 --> 47:15.348
Okay, now remember, you ease over...

47:16.122 --> 47:18.491
you check out the hamper...

47:18.591 --> 47:21.127
and then make your move, okay?

47:21.227 --> 47:23.090
All right. Let's go.

47:24.530 --> 47:26.393
- Wait a minute.
- What?

47:27.566 --> 47:29.402
What do I do if I get lucky?

47:29.502 --> 47:32.204
- Come on, we've been over this 100 times.
- I know.

47:32.304 --> 47:35.237
Okay. Do you have enough money
for a motel room?

47:35.407 --> 47:36.308
Yeah.

47:36.408 --> 47:37.877
- You do?
- Yeah.

47:37.977 --> 47:40.568
- Okay, do you have protection?
- Yeah.

47:43.048 --> 47:45.548
You intend to invite four friends?

47:46.218 --> 47:48.684
I didn't know what size I'd need.

47:48.921 --> 47:50.352
Try petite.

47:50.723 --> 47:52.222
Now come on.

47:55.961 --> 47:57.296
Come on, Jamie.

47:57.396 --> 48:00.294
- Maybe we should come back later.
- Come on!

48:04.937 --> 48:06.368
- Hi.
- Hello.

48:08.073 --> 48:10.176
I was wondering
if you needed any help...

48:10.276 --> 48:13.311
folding your undergarments or anything?

48:18.951 --> 48:20.279
Hi, there.

48:21.687 --> 48:24.051
I'm Russ and I'm a Sagittarius.

48:25.057 --> 48:28.251
I enjoy surfing, candlelit dinners,
and Tolstoy.

48:31.197 --> 48:34.433
I'm a mature person,
and you're a mature person.

48:34.533 --> 48:37.796
So why don't we just skip
all the bullshit...

48:38.103 --> 48:40.398
get rid of our inhibitions...

48:40.806 --> 48:43.636
and do what we really want to do?

48:44.009 --> 48:45.736
Sounds good to me.

48:46.645 --> 48:48.347
Why don't we go to your place?

48:48.447 --> 48:51.617
I'll tie you up on your bed.
I'd love to whip you.

48:51.717 --> 48:53.919
We can't do it in my bed!

48:54.019 --> 48:58.021
I sleep with my brother,
and he's a chronic bed wetter.

48:58.257 --> 48:59.915
Maybe next time.

49:12.972 --> 49:14.801
- Jamie?
- Hi.

49:21.747 --> 49:24.281
- So, how'd it go?
- She said no.

49:35.894 --> 49:39.031
- Hi! Can I help you with something?
- Yes, I'm looking for a skirt.

49:39.131 --> 49:42.098
Something that'll go
with a grayish blouse.

49:43.035 --> 49:44.570
Any particular color?

49:44.670 --> 49:46.795
- Something in white.
- Okay.

49:48.374 --> 49:51.034
I think I've got just the thing.

49:53.612 --> 49:55.043
Here.

49:56.015 --> 49:59.016
- How about something like this?
- I like that.

49:59.151 --> 50:01.587
Good. We also have it in yellow,
if you prefer.

50:01.687 --> 50:02.955
I like the white.

50:03.055 --> 50:07.059
Why don't you try it on in the dressing
room. I'll be with you in just a minute.

50:07.159 --> 50:08.283
Okay.

50:10.763 --> 50:12.558
What are you doing?

50:12.831 --> 50:15.126
- Shopping.
- Really?

50:15.234 --> 50:17.069
Know what I'm shopping for?

50:17.169 --> 50:18.736
- No, what?
- Kisses.

50:22.441 --> 50:24.372
- What?
- You bit my lip!

50:25.010 --> 50:26.236
I did?

50:27.313 --> 50:28.505
Yeah.

50:29.315 --> 50:31.440
You shouldn't be so sweet.

50:33.452 --> 50:35.588
I kind of like these. What do you think?

50:35.688 --> 50:37.022
Check it out.

50:37.122 --> 50:40.123
They're kind of, you know, black.

50:40.225 --> 50:42.816
That's what I like about them.

50:43.228 --> 50:45.193
All right. Try them on.

50:50.002 --> 50:53.505
I'll get a sweater that'll lighten up
the black pants a little bit.

50:53.605 --> 50:55.104
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:08.721 --> 51:10.186
Hello, Mark.

51:15.294 --> 51:18.063
What are you doing here?
Where did you come from?

51:18.163 --> 51:19.932
I've been here watching you.

51:20.032 --> 51:22.066
I'm always watching you.

51:24.269 --> 51:26.929
Here, try this one. It's really neat.

51:28.707 --> 51:30.968
Baby blue. Wouldn't you know.

51:31.243 --> 51:32.833
Wow! That was quick!

51:33.612 --> 51:35.147
Wait a minute. I see another one.

51:35.247 --> 51:37.508
If it's pink, I'm gonna puke.

51:41.387 --> 51:44.356
Honestly, how can you stand
that little twerp?

51:44.456 --> 51:45.958
She's not a little twerp.

51:46.058 --> 51:47.591
I love Robin.

51:47.726 --> 51:49.384
And I love Mark.

51:49.695 --> 51:51.764
Would you just leave me alone?

51:51.864 --> 51:54.600
What're you talking about?
You're the one who asked me...

51:54.700 --> 51:57.636
Don't come in.
I don't have any pants on!

51:57.736 --> 51:59.030
Stop it!

51:59.438 --> 52:02.308
I've seen you in your shorts before,
Mark Kendall.

52:02.408 --> 52:05.244
Let the little creep in. I don't mind.

52:05.344 --> 52:06.604
I mind.

52:09.214 --> 52:11.748
- Leave me alone!
- I certainly will.

52:11.950 --> 52:15.076
Boy, you're acting really weird,
you know that?

52:21.894 --> 52:23.222
Listen...

52:23.996 --> 52:26.031
you got to cool it. I mean it.

52:26.131 --> 52:29.758
You know, you're a very pretty lady.
We had a nice time.

52:30.102 --> 52:32.261
But it can't go on forever.

52:33.038 --> 52:35.971
Forever is just what I had in mind.

52:37.009 --> 52:39.678
You don't know what's happening,
do you, Mark?

52:39.778 --> 52:43.211
I know if Robin sees us together,
I'm in big trouble.

52:43.549 --> 52:46.117
Don't be such a big baby.

52:46.952 --> 52:49.247
Please don't bite my buttons.

53:03.302 --> 53:05.529
Are you all right?

53:11.043 --> 53:12.610
What happened?

53:12.811 --> 53:15.072
Guess I must have passed out.

53:15.447 --> 53:17.742
Are you sure you're all right?

53:18.350 --> 53:20.418
Has this happened before?

53:21.453 --> 53:23.748
Maybe you should see a doctor.

53:24.156 --> 53:25.314
Yeah.

53:28.460 --> 53:29.728
Let's get out of here.

53:29.828 --> 53:32.631
Countess, did you get
your second transfusion?

53:32.731 --> 53:36.528
Of course, and I'll get the third one,
too, despite that girl.

53:36.702 --> 53:39.671
She's got a much stronger hold on him
than I thought.

53:39.771 --> 53:43.432
She's young, she's sweet,
and she's pissing me off.

54:16.308 --> 54:18.000
My God, it lives.

54:18.744 --> 54:20.869
- What time is it?
- 8:15.

54:27.653 --> 54:31.849
- Are you feeling better?
- Better than what? I'm feeling fine.

54:34.493 --> 54:37.255
It's a little bright in here, isn't it?

54:40.499 --> 54:42.968
You don't eat right, you know that?

54:43.068 --> 54:46.038
I'm making your favorite breakfast,
egg burger.

54:46.138 --> 54:47.364
Great.

54:49.374 --> 54:52.602
- What happened to your shirt?
- Shirt?

54:52.978 --> 54:55.714
The one you wore last night.
All the buttons are gone.

54:55.814 --> 54:58.883
That's the second time.
How'd you manage that?

55:00.352 --> 55:02.287
This jogging crap is for the birds.

55:02.387 --> 55:05.513
It's really bad
for your knees and your back, Dad.

55:05.757 --> 55:07.960
You should have told me that
five years ago.

55:08.060 --> 55:11.493
- Would you like an egg burger, dear?
- Yes. Thank you.

55:14.633 --> 55:16.792
I'd like to have a little talk with you.

55:17.202 --> 55:19.204
What time is it? I got to go!

55:19.304 --> 55:22.373
- Aren't you going to finish your juice?
- Yeah.

55:26.979 --> 55:28.637
See you tonight.

55:36.121 --> 55:38.314
He couldn't be anemic.

55:39.124 --> 55:40.486
Could he?

55:49.668 --> 55:51.633
- Pushup bar.
- Fudge bar.

56:06.618 --> 56:09.118
- Holy shit!
- Let's get out of here!

56:39.618 --> 56:41.345
I'm sorry, Father.

56:41.653 --> 56:43.380
- Have a drink.
- No.

57:12.451 --> 57:15.987
Father, forgive me,
'cause I think I might have sinned.

57:16.621 --> 57:20.487
Last week,
I went to a bar in Hollywood...

57:20.592 --> 57:22.626
where I met this strange woman.

57:23.862 --> 57:26.021
She took me to her house...

57:27.399 --> 57:29.134
and I think we had a good time.

57:29.234 --> 57:32.337
But ever since then,
weird things have been happening.

57:32.437 --> 57:34.596
She keeps following me around!

57:35.407 --> 57:37.142
Even in my dreams, she's there...

57:37.242 --> 57:40.607
you know, just sort of
screwing around with my life!

57:41.246 --> 57:42.677
The worst part...

57:44.850 --> 57:46.918
is that I feel like I'm changing.

57:47.719 --> 57:49.912
I do all these funny things.

57:50.388 --> 57:53.889
I frightened a couple of kids
just by looking at them.

57:57.062 --> 57:59.153
I'm starting to freak out.

58:00.866 --> 58:03.366
You're the only one I can turn to.

58:04.202 --> 58:08.671
- What can I do?
- Get yourself a shovel. You're in deep shit.

58:38.970 --> 58:40.435
Hello, Mark.

01:00:05.423 --> 01:00:06.888
I'm not mad.

01:00:07.092 --> 01:00:10.462
I just thought we agreed
that we'd dress alike, that's all.

01:00:10.562 --> 01:00:13.365
If I had known
you were going to dress as a vampire...

01:00:13.465 --> 01:00:15.767
I'm not dressed like a vampire.

01:00:15.867 --> 01:00:18.800
I told you, I couldn't get out
and get a costume today.

01:00:20.572 --> 01:00:24.608
The point is, I just feel silly
dressed as Jill without Jack.

01:00:25.343 --> 01:00:29.470
If anybody asks, tell them
Jack couldn't get it up after the fall.

01:00:30.015 --> 01:00:32.549
- Hi, Robin. Hi, Mark.
- Hi, Suzette.

01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:37.122
I love your outfits. Let me take your names
for the best costume contest.

01:00:37.222 --> 01:00:38.380
Sure.

01:00:39.724 --> 01:00:41.655
Robin Pierce...

01:00:41.927 --> 01:00:45.019
Jill, sans Jack.

01:00:47.332 --> 01:00:49.923
And Mark Kendall...

01:00:50.735 --> 01:00:52.029
vampire.

01:00:52.237 --> 01:00:54.328
I'm not wearing a costume.

01:00:57.142 --> 01:00:58.436
You nut.

01:01:46.658 --> 01:01:50.228
- Pinocchio, you look great.
- What are you supposed to be?

01:01:50.328 --> 01:01:53.732
I was going to be Gandhi,
but I couldn't find glasses or a mustache...

01:01:53.832 --> 01:01:56.628
so now I'm Yul Brynner.

01:01:57.736 --> 01:02:01.169
- That's a great vampire...
- I'm not wearing a costume.

01:02:03.008 --> 01:02:05.042
I gotta get some punch.

01:02:06.478 --> 01:02:08.773
- Hi, Mark.
- Hi, sir.

01:06:03.181 --> 01:06:06.818
- Damn that girl!
- If I've been wrong, revise our plan.

01:06:06.918 --> 01:06:09.418
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

01:07:00.772 --> 01:07:04.467
<i>Excuse me. May I have your attention</i>
<i>for a moment, please?</i>

01:07:09.013 --> 01:07:11.449
<i>Thank you. I'm pleased to announce...</i>

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:14.777
<i>that the winner</i>
<i>of the best-costume contest is...</i>

01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:17.744
<i>Mark Kendall as a vampire!</i>

01:07:19.424 --> 01:07:21.685
I'm not wearing a costume!

01:07:41.279 --> 01:07:43.870
- Robin.
- What happened?

01:07:44.248 --> 01:07:46.584
I'm sorry,
I don't know what came over me.

01:07:46.684 --> 01:07:51.244
It was just... All those kids were
yelling and screaming and freaking out.

01:07:51.522 --> 01:07:54.420
They were just glad
for you that you won.

01:07:54.559 --> 01:07:57.253
I know. It's just... I don't know.

01:07:57.562 --> 01:07:59.960
It just felt weird for a second.

01:08:14.078 --> 01:08:17.511
- Mark! What is it?
- Look! I'm not there!

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:21.075
Look!

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:31.019
I swear, I wasn't there a minute ago.

01:08:32.697 --> 01:08:34.787
It's her. It's that woman.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.995
The one that bit your buttons?

01:08:39.604 --> 01:08:43.504
I think she's a vampire,
and I think she's turning me into one.

01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:46.000
Turning you into a vampire?

01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:50.113
That's why I couldn't see myself.
Vampires don't have a reflection.

01:08:50.214 --> 01:08:52.509
But you're there. See?

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:54.816
Oh, my God!

01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:00.318
Vampires?

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.091
Vampires? Did you say...

01:09:06.163 --> 01:09:09.358
Yes! Do I have some books on vampires!

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:12.428
Goodness gracious! Just follow me.

01:09:13.004 --> 01:09:14.971
You know, it is most unfortunate...

01:09:15.072 --> 01:09:18.868
the shocking reputation
that vampires are having these days.

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:22.473
You know, most people
are basing their opinions...

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.240
on those silly vampire movies.

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:27.585
What is this doing here?

01:09:27.685 --> 01:09:29.720
Is there such a thing
as a female vampire?

01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:33.890
But of course. The result of a vampire bite,
just the same as any other vampire.

01:09:33.991 --> 01:09:36.661
You know, there are even cases
of cat and dog vampires.

01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:40.398
Don't worry about it. The cleaning lady
will fix it when she comes next week.

01:09:40.497 --> 01:09:44.535
As I was saying, cat and dog vampires.
And I even remember, once in the 1960s...

01:09:44.635 --> 01:09:46.770
a gerbil was bitten in the hind leg...

01:09:46.871 --> 01:09:49.701
Could a woman vampire
actually exist today?

01:09:49.941 --> 01:09:51.743
Like, maybe in Hollywood?

01:09:51.843 --> 01:09:56.573
That's the ideal place.
You see, she can blend in with the crowd.

01:09:57.014 --> 01:09:59.717
Could one of these lady vampires
actually bite a guy?

01:09:59.817 --> 01:10:01.586
You know, like, a teenage guy?

01:10:01.686 --> 01:10:04.880
- How old would he be?
- Like, 18.

01:10:05.156 --> 01:10:06.724
I seriously doubt it.

01:10:06.824 --> 01:10:10.194
You see, the female vampire
needs the blood of a virgin.

01:10:10.294 --> 01:10:13.931
And an 18-year-old boy
would hardly be a virgin, now, would he?

01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:17.100
Just hypothetically,
what if he was a virgin?

01:10:19.036 --> 01:10:23.095
Then I think he has a lot bigger problems
to worry about than female vampires.

01:10:25.243 --> 01:10:27.607
If he got bitten, how would you know?

01:10:27.879 --> 01:10:32.439
You would then just look for a bite
on the inside of the thigh...

01:10:32.783 --> 01:10:36.580
like this one, piercing the artery.

01:10:37.154 --> 01:10:40.314
Apparently, attacks so close
to the source of...

01:10:40.558 --> 01:10:43.889
In the case of a virgin,
untapped sexual potency...

01:10:44.095 --> 01:10:48.097
is what the woman vampire needs
to retain her youth and beauty.

01:10:48.833 --> 01:10:53.233
I have over here, somewhere,
a book of plates showing color...

01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:55.564
Hello?

01:10:57.575 --> 01:10:58.733
Goodness gracious.

01:11:02.547 --> 01:11:05.445
Wait up!
I have to talk to you about Mark.

01:11:05.683 --> 01:11:08.686
- What's going on?
- Mark's been acting strange lately.

01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:11.155
- Don't we all?
- But I did some research...

01:11:11.255 --> 01:11:15.883
and what I found out is that Mark
may have contracted some sort of disease.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.924
- Like a venereal disease?
- Sort of.

01:11:21.966 --> 01:11:24.830
But I need you guys
to find out for sure.

01:11:27.004 --> 01:11:29.040
What do you want us to do?

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:32.767
I need you to check his inner thigh
for two little sores.

01:11:35.346 --> 01:11:36.314
Sores?

01:11:36.414 --> 01:11:38.277
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

01:11:38.849 --> 01:11:41.385
I thought Mark meant something to you.

01:11:41.485 --> 01:11:44.076
If you're really his friends,
you'll do this.

01:12:17.254 --> 01:12:19.584
All right, we still on
for tomorrow night?

01:12:24.328 --> 01:12:25.793
I need soap.

01:12:35.439 --> 01:12:39.031
The water is too cold!
I need hot water over here.

01:13:16.547 --> 01:13:18.239
Now, Jamie, look!

01:13:21.085 --> 01:13:22.853
What the hell are you guys doing?

01:13:22.953 --> 01:13:24.748
Fags in the shower!

01:13:25.256 --> 01:13:27.017
Fag alert!

01:13:34.231 --> 01:13:35.457
Great!

01:13:38.536 --> 01:13:40.228
This is terrible.

01:13:42.339 --> 01:13:44.275
I can't believe this happened.

01:13:44.375 --> 01:13:47.535
It's the most humiliating experience
of my life.

01:13:49.013 --> 01:13:50.580
This is awful.

01:13:51.782 --> 01:13:54.585
This is the suckiest thing
that could ever happen.

01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:57.345
The whole school thinks we're gay.

01:13:57.955 --> 01:14:01.826
Don't be such a twerp.
Our past histories speak for themselves.

01:14:01.926 --> 01:14:05.029
- No one's gonna think we're gay.
- I don't have a past history.

01:14:05.129 --> 01:14:07.697
And neither do you. This is it.

01:14:08.099 --> 01:14:11.002
We might as well move in together
and get his-and-his towels.

01:14:11.102 --> 01:14:13.693
Who cares what those assholes think?

01:14:19.744 --> 01:14:22.780
What were they doing in the showers
in the first place?

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.548
They were washing.

01:14:24.648 --> 01:14:27.308
We were enacting a prison rape scene.

01:14:45.469 --> 01:14:48.436
What was that scene in the shower
all about?

01:14:48.906 --> 01:14:51.676
That's the thanks I get
for trying to help out a friend?

01:14:51.776 --> 01:14:54.174
You're a big help. Thanks a lot.

01:14:56.046 --> 01:15:00.105
Did it ever occur to you guys
that maybe you could have asked me?

01:15:02.853 --> 01:15:05.523
- Oh, my God!
- She told us to look!

01:15:05.623 --> 01:15:09.260
- I knew it. We enjoyed it.
- Jamie, would you shut up?

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.829
No, that's it. We're homos.
We're rump rangers.

01:15:11.929 --> 01:15:13.018
No!

01:15:16.567 --> 01:15:18.134
What the hell?

01:16:20.264 --> 01:16:23.060
Why don't you shoot off a cannon? Jesus.

01:16:27.004 --> 01:16:28.435
Be careful.

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.132
- My stomach is starting to gurgle.
- Will you shut up?

01:16:36.113 --> 01:16:38.306
God! Come on!

01:17:14.785 --> 01:17:16.720
I got to go to the bathroom.

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.411
- Tough shit.
- Tie it off, man.

01:17:25.896 --> 01:17:27.464
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:17:27.564 --> 01:17:30.534
Goddamn it, will you forget
your function for five minutes?

01:17:30.634 --> 01:17:33.965
I can't! This always happens to me
when I'm scared.

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:39.033
Wait.

01:17:41.612 --> 01:17:42.804
Help!

01:17:46.483 --> 01:17:48.016
Are you okay?

01:17:51.722 --> 01:17:54.086
Why did you go with that creep?

01:17:55.326 --> 01:17:57.758
"I needed you." That's all he said?

01:17:58.162 --> 01:17:59.530
I got to go.

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:02.199
The sooner we get her loose,
the sooner you're gonna.

01:18:02.299 --> 01:18:04.390
Work on her feet. Come on!

01:18:07.471 --> 01:18:08.697
Sorry.

01:18:09.273 --> 01:18:12.409
Mark, you're still a virgin.
She never made love to you.

01:18:12.509 --> 01:18:15.737
She just took your blood from...
You know.

01:18:17.681 --> 01:18:19.749
Can't I have any privacy?

01:18:21.218 --> 01:18:24.082
- I hate this whole thing.
- Come on.

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:41.237
Quiet, please.

01:18:42.339 --> 01:18:44.669
Gentlemen and ladies...

01:18:45.409 --> 01:18:48.444
welcome to this most
auspicious occasion.

01:18:50.147 --> 01:18:52.238
And now for the unveiling.

01:19:26.183 --> 01:19:28.342
Okay. That's not funny now.

01:19:31.088 --> 01:19:32.746
Guys, I mean...

01:19:35.526 --> 01:19:37.594
All right. Now I'm angry.

01:19:50.441 --> 01:19:51.667
Great.

01:19:52.209 --> 01:19:53.744
Dearest Mark...

01:19:53.844 --> 01:19:57.812
twice, we have shared
a mystical experience.

01:19:59.483 --> 01:20:02.711
Tonight, the holy third!

01:20:02.986 --> 01:20:04.417
Hear, hear.

01:20:10.727 --> 01:20:13.097
Please don't bite the buttons
off this jacket.

01:20:13.197 --> 01:20:16.824
It belongs to my father.
Besides, you might chip a tooth.

01:20:17.768 --> 01:20:19.961
They'll hardly bother these.

01:20:20.938 --> 01:20:24.098
I don't want to be a vampire.
I'm a day person.

01:20:55.672 --> 01:20:58.468
Move away from him! Up against the wall!

01:21:04.114 --> 01:21:07.411
Mark, it's me, Robin. Do you remember?

01:21:08.519 --> 01:21:10.888
We've known each other forever and ever.

01:21:10.988 --> 01:21:12.180
Mark!

01:21:14.391 --> 01:21:18.894
I'm the owner of the pants you've been
trying to get into for the last four years.

01:21:19.263 --> 01:21:20.887
- Robin?
- Yes.

01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:25.766
How would you like your crotch
set on fire?

01:21:26.136 --> 01:21:27.601
Rough trade.

01:21:28.672 --> 01:21:29.973
Stand back!

01:21:30.073 --> 01:21:31.775
Put down the cross.

01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:33.377
It only works in movies.

01:21:33.477 --> 01:21:35.511
Besides, I'm an atheist.

01:21:35.746 --> 01:21:38.212
Fire, on the other hand...

01:21:44.922 --> 01:21:46.250
Back off!

01:21:47.324 --> 01:21:48.618
Come on!

01:22:08.245 --> 01:22:10.210
I can be yours, Mark...

01:22:11.081 --> 01:22:12.375
forever...

01:22:14.051 --> 01:22:16.949
showing you joys
you never dreamed possible...

01:22:17.988 --> 01:22:21.114
in your most fevered adolescent slumber.

01:22:22.893 --> 01:22:26.130
Mark doesn't want you,
because you're mean and evil.

01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:29.561
He wants me,
because I'm nice and sweet and pure.

01:22:29.666 --> 01:22:31.131
So fuck off!

01:22:33.503 --> 01:22:35.230
After that virgin!

01:22:35.839 --> 01:22:37.167
Come on!

01:22:41.878 --> 01:22:44.548
- Run!
- Are you crazy? They'll kill you.

01:22:44.648 --> 01:22:47.551
They want you, not us.
We'll hold them off.

01:22:47.651 --> 01:22:49.343
- We will?
- Go!

01:22:53.323 --> 01:22:55.482
See you in school tomorrow.

01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:06.133
- Hurry up!
- Can I put my pants on?

01:23:10.641 --> 01:23:12.038
Holy shit.

01:23:29.359 --> 01:23:30.861
All right, they're not here.

01:23:30.961 --> 01:23:34.030
You come with us.
The rest of you go that way.

01:23:52.449 --> 01:23:53.675
Hello.

01:23:54.818 --> 01:23:56.909
Look what got left behind.

01:23:58.588 --> 01:24:01.714
Could one of you please show me
where the bathroom is?

01:24:05.929 --> 01:24:07.963
Don't let them get away!

01:24:13.904 --> 01:24:15.973
- We'll go back this way.
- But...

01:24:16.073 --> 01:24:19.336
Trust me, we've got them
right where we want them.

01:24:36.093 --> 01:24:37.524
After them!

01:24:52.476 --> 01:24:54.211
You bungling idiot!

01:24:54.311 --> 01:24:58.507
I'm a mature person,
and you're a mature person.

01:24:58.715 --> 01:25:01.784
So why don't we just skip
all the bullshit...

01:25:01.952 --> 01:25:06.546
get rid of our inhibitions,
and do what we really want to do.

01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:41.755
I could have done that.

01:25:43.026 --> 01:25:47.290
I haven't had this much fun since,
like, Haight-Ashbury.

01:25:52.302 --> 01:25:53.460
So...

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.669
what should we do now?

01:26:29.272 --> 01:26:31.966
You stay here. We'll go the other way.

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.215
Get those doors.

01:26:38.315 --> 01:26:40.144
Hurry. Get that one.

01:27:00.437 --> 01:27:02.004
Wait a minute!

01:27:02.606 --> 01:27:05.242
I have to replace every door
you people smash.

01:27:05.342 --> 01:27:08.468
- Can't you at least try the knob first?
- Jocks.

01:28:02.032 --> 01:28:03.690
You're too late.

01:28:05.168 --> 01:28:08.465
You couldn't have.
You've been in there less than a minute.

01:28:14.945 --> 01:28:16.637
You could have...

01:28:17.414 --> 01:28:20.074
but you didn't have time to enjoy it.

01:28:23.353 --> 01:28:25.011
What time is it?

01:28:25.589 --> 01:28:26.917
Midnight.

01:28:41.471 --> 01:28:44.165
Somebody get a plastic surgeon. Quick!

01:28:45.308 --> 01:28:46.966
I need a virgin!

01:29:01.725 --> 01:29:03.656
Countess, don't worry.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:06.460
There are other virgins out there.

01:29:07.497 --> 01:29:11.260
Somewhere, in places like Kansas...

01:29:12.168 --> 01:29:13.496
Nebraska.

01:29:18.808 --> 01:29:21.172
I'll never find another virgin.

01:29:22.212 --> 01:29:23.380
Never!

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.878
Now, now. I'll take care of you.

01:29:26.916 --> 01:29:28.950
There's always tomorrow.

01:29:30.954 --> 01:29:33.123
You know, maybe the Countess is right.

01:29:33.223 --> 01:29:35.314
It would be better slower.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.550
Let's find out.

01:29:42.465 --> 01:29:44.931
I believe I've created a monster.

01:30:10.126 --> 01:30:13.828
<i>I saw your face and right away</i>

01:30:13.928 --> 01:30:17.824
<i>Somethin' inside me trembled tenderly</i>

01:30:17.924 --> 01:30:21.843
<i>And in your eyes, boy, I could see</i>

01:30:21.943 --> 01:30:24.364
<i>You'd be mine</i>

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:29.845
<i>I know your mind is filled with doubt</i>

01:30:29.945 --> 01:30:33.138
<i>But I'm beggin' you to hear me out</i>

01:30:33.238 --> 01:30:36.736
<i>No need for your suspicion</i>

01:30:37.782 --> 01:30:39.867
<i>Once bitten</i>

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:42.579
<i>You won't feel no pain, boy
Once bitten</i>

01:30:42.679 --> 01:30:46.397
<i>Once bitten
We're singin' in the rain, boy</i>

01:30:46.497 --> 01:30:50.308
<i>When lightnin' strikes
Oh, oh</i>

01:30:50.408 --> 01:30:53.990
<i>Your heart's gonna be mine forever</i>

01:30:54.474 --> 01:30:57.754
<i>Gonna be mine forever</i>

01:30:57.854 --> 01:31:00.942
<i>You won't feel no pain, boy</i>

01:31:09.173 --> 01:31:13.003
<i>Eyes on fire looked at me</i>

01:31:13.103 --> 01:31:16.992
<i>I saw somethin' there
you didn't want me to see</i>

01:31:17.092 --> 01:31:20.537
<i>Your desire burnin' me</i>

01:31:20.637 --> 01:31:23.084
<i>Like a flame</i>

01:31:23.184 --> 01:31:25.029
<i>Oh, oh</i>

01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:28.396
<i>I know what it is you need</i>

01:31:28.496 --> 01:31:31.869
<i>Why make it harder than it has to be?</i>

01:31:31.969 --> 01:31:36.175
<i>I have this premonition</i>

01:31:36.582 --> 01:31:38.667
<i>Once bitten</i>

01:31:38.767 --> 01:31:41.379
<i>You won't feel no pain, boy
Once bitten</i>

01:31:41.479 --> 01:31:45.197
<i>Once bitten
We're singin' in the rain, boy</i>

01:31:45.297 --> 01:31:49.108
<i>When lightnin' strikes
Oh, oh</i>

01:31:49.208 --> 01:31:52.182
<i>Your heart's gonna be mine forever</i>

01:31:52.282 --> 01:31:54.367
<i>Once bitten</i>

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:57.079
<i>You won't feel no pain, boy
Once bitten</i>

01:31:57.179 --> 01:32:00.897
<i>Once bitten
We're singin' in the rain, boy</i>

01:32:00.997 --> 01:32:04.808
<i>When lightnin' strikes
Oh, oh</i>

01:32:04.908 --> 01:32:08.790
<i>Your heart's gonna be mine forever</i>

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:12.144
<i>Gonna be mine forever</i>

01:32:12.244 --> 01:32:15.806
<i>You won't feel no pain, boy</i>

01:32:16.306 --> 01:32:19.305
<i>You won't feel no pain, boy</i>

01:32:20.497 --> 01:32:24.374
<i>We'll see the light,
we'll hear the thunder</i>

01:32:24.474 --> 01:32:28.518
<i>I need your touch
It's a spell you put me under</i>

01:32:28.618 --> 01:32:31.763
<i>Ain't no denyin'</i>

01:32:31.863 --> 01:32:37.151
<i>Gonna be mine forever and I ain't lyin'</i>

01:32:51.178 --> 01:32:53.898
<i>Once bitten...</i>
