21:24.492 --> 21:26.494
-The wound is...
-ELIZABETH: Infected.

21:26.536 --> 21:29.622
-Yes, I can see.
-The color turns.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.541
And her temperature,
it's rising.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.840
A doctor may be summoned.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.467
Thank you.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.429
You see?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.639
And that little thing?

21:46.681 --> 21:48.683
-Leave it.
-I could perhaps
repair her wing.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.560
I know how to.

21:50.601 --> 21:54.188
There are many sparrows
in the sky, but this one?

21:54.230 --> 21:56.941
Death brought
this one to my door.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.318
It cannot be saved.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.158
Thank you, Lady Margit.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.994
Your attention to small things
does not go unnoticed,

22:08.036 --> 22:11.581
or unappreciated.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.793
-Ava.
-I'll be along, my lady.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.886
(door closes)

22:24.927 --> 22:27.764
Take care of the
foolish creature.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.112
(bird chitters)

22:49.869 --> 22:53.247
Forgive me, but Lady Margit,

22:53.289 --> 22:55.458
she's not like
the peasant girls.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.795
That's precisely why
you brought her to me.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.339
And now, her time has come.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.382
But she'll be missed.

23:08.262 --> 23:11.516
She'll be missed, Countess.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.519
There are many sparrows,
but there is only one Margit.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.315
Do you need help?

23:19.357 --> 23:21.359
A partner at the very end.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.616
(scoffs)

23:30.451 --> 23:32.495
Where is your head, Ava?

23:32.537 --> 23:35.248
I need my remedy, now.

23:35.289 --> 23:39.168
This peasant drivel is useless.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.754
You heard the girl say it
herself. I am aging.

23:41.796 --> 23:45.550
-I'll find another noble.
-You will not! There is no time!

23:45.591 --> 23:50.221
If I don't take her blood,
her beauty, her youth...

23:52.557 --> 23:54.559
Then I will fade.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.148
It's happened before.

24:00.189 --> 24:03.151
When Ferenc died,
I became weak.

24:03.192 --> 24:08.406
All that he loved about me,
everything that I was, faded.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.867
I thought perhaps it best
to join him in death.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.747
But then you appeared...

24:22.545 --> 24:24.255
...and hurt me.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.215
In my rage, I hurt you back.

24:29.385 --> 24:32.305
But when your essence
hit my skin,

24:32.346 --> 24:34.599
as my youth flooded back to me,

24:34.640 --> 24:37.560
I realized you hadn't hurt me.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.645
You'd brought me back to life.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.783
Don't you ever forget, Ava,

24:52.825 --> 24:55.036
the girls, the blood...

24:55.077 --> 24:58.122
it all began with you.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.541

Sophi, she snuck out
of the castle

25:43.793 --> 25:46.295
and was attacked
by a wild animal.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.630

I-I can help her.
