You getting anything on that?

00:33.967 --> 00:35.735
Well, hold on a tick.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.272
Yes, follow me, Gerald.

00:41.708 --> 00:45.178
-Well?
-We're pretty close.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.546
This way.

00:48.782 --> 00:49.983
Shh!

00:50.950 --> 00:52.585
Don't panic.

00:52.652 --> 00:56.322
I thought you were a ghost.
Scared the wits out of me!

00:56.389 --> 01:00.160
Sorry.
Thought you'd be used to us
creeping around by now.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.362
Have you seen any recently?
Ghosts?

01:02.429 --> 01:05.665
I've seen three today.
It's getting worse.

01:05.732 --> 01:09.202
-Well,
you're a very brave girl.
-Thank you, sir.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.339
-Where did you see them?
-In the ward.

01:22.348 --> 01:24.717
Mind, half of this lot
see things anyway.

01:24.784 --> 01:27.086
Nerves shot to pieces.
Poor chaps.

01:27.153 --> 01:29.322
Soon as they're better,
they'll be sent
back to the front.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.415
We're right on top of it.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.071
-Hello?
-TOSHIKO: Tell them.

02:18.137 --> 02:22.308
-Tell us what?
-Tell them what to do.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.711
You're the only one
who can stop this.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.580
If you don't,
it's the end of everything.

02:29.616 --> 02:31.084
Tommy...

02:33.586 --> 02:37.790
Take me. I'm in there,
in the ward, in 1918.

02:37.857 --> 02:40.927
You have to take me
so I can be here now.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.264
Just take me!

02:47.333 --> 02:50.236
Tommy? I think you'd better
come with us.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.871
-Why?
-Don't worry.

02:51.938 --> 02:55.675
I'm Gerald and
this is Harriet.
We'll look after you.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.645
Who are you?

02:58.711 --> 02:59.913
We're Torchwood.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.257
-GWEN: Who is he?
-Thomas Reginald Brockless.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.825
-Tommy.
-Twenty-four years old.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.828
-Sort of.
-Well,
he's either 24 or he's not.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.431
-Depends how you work it out.
-All right, when was he born?

03:51.497 --> 03:53.066
1894.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.538
-Owen, you ready?
-Yeah, nearly.

03:58.605 --> 04:01.307
-Is that a dress, Tosh?
-I do believe it is, Owen.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.309
Well, where is he?

04:03.376 --> 04:06.245
JACK:
He's been here for 90 years,
longer than any of us.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.147
Any of you.

04:08.214 --> 04:11.417
TOSHIKO: Torchwood have used
alien cryogenics since
Victorian times.

04:11.484 --> 04:14.320
They froze Tommy in 1918.

04:14.387 --> 04:18.391
JACK:
So he's 24 or 114 years old.
I know which one I'd choose.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.426
We have to wake him up
every 12 months or so.

04:20.493 --> 04:23.596
Well,
defrost him, one day only,
then back in the freezer.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.264
-Why?
-Check he still works.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.500
One day we're gonna need him.

04:28.501 --> 04:31.170
Right, everybody ready?

04:39.178 --> 04:40.613
Come on, Tommy.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.960
Charging 200. Clear!

04:58.064 --> 05:00.199

Get off me! Leave me alone!

05:08.207 --> 05:09.742
-Tommy!
-Leave me alone.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.680

-Toshiko...
-Remember?

05:24.924 --> 05:27.960
-Gets harder every year.
-Good left hook, though.

05:28.027 --> 05:30.563
Do you know where you are?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.976

05:44.043 --> 05:45.445
That's right.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.881
Is it time again?

05:50.483 --> 05:51.584
Blimey.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.454
How are you feeling?

06:00.326 --> 06:02.428
I could murder a cup of tea.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.068
IANTO:
Don't expect the best china.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.737
-I'm starving.
-Visitors only.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.806
Tuck in, there's enough here
to feed an army.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.943
-Nice dress.
-Thank you.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.045
Got your slacks on underneath.
Is it that cold outside?

06:19.112 --> 06:20.480
It's the fashion this year.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.982
1968 they were in miniskirts.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.084
Thought all my Christmases
had come at once.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.553
Shame they
haven't made a comeback.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.422
I still don't get it.
Why is he here?

06:29.489 --> 06:32.291
Like I said, one day,
we're gonna need him.

06:33.926 --> 06:38.498
And pull to me.
Good, seems fine.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.166
I just need to take a few

06:40.233 --> 06:42.835
-blood samples.
-Blood samples.

06:42.902 --> 06:46.239
We wake you up once a year
and stick needles into you.

06:46.305 --> 06:47.774
-It's not fair.
-Once a year for you,

06:47.840 --> 06:50.543
it's every day for me.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.946
-So, while we wait...

in Blackley, Manchester.

06:58.050 --> 07:01.220
Private officer
in 10th West
Yorkshire Regiment.

07:01.287 --> 07:02.722
Very good.

07:02.789 --> 07:06.125
Only son of
Constance May Bassett,
died 1900,

07:06.192 --> 07:12.131
and Thomas Campbell Brockless,
died June1931, aged 57.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.202
Heart attack.

07:16.269 --> 07:20.973
-That's right, isn't it?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.777
It's all right. I just haven't
had that much time
to get used to it.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.647
OWEN: Right, I need to have
a look at this leg.

07:29.782 --> 07:34.253
St Teilo's Hospital, 1918.
There was a time shift.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.621
A fracture in
the rift means that

07:35.688 --> 07:37.757
two slices of time
were erupting into each other.

07:37.824 --> 07:40.793
-A slice of 1918 and...?
-A slice of the future.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.563
But we don't know
exactly what slice.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.766
It could be tomorrow,
it could be in
100 years' time.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.401
What will happen?

07:48.467 --> 07:51.204
Chunks of 1918
will start to
appear at the hospital.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.674
A few at first, then more
and more. When the time
shift is complete,

07:54.740 --> 07:57.743
it'll start a chain reaction.
Unless we stop it,

07:57.810 --> 08:00.546
time shifts'll start happening
all over the country,

08:00.613 --> 08:04.350
-then all over the world.
-But how does Tommy fit in?

08:04.417 --> 08:06.686
He helps us stop it somehow.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.923
Torchwood 1918
left us sealed orders.

08:15.161 --> 08:21.667
"Eyes only documents,
FAO Torchwood, commander
overseeing case 1918/TB."

08:23.769 --> 08:25.605
Tommy Brockless?

08:31.043 --> 08:32.845
-Okay, it's stuck.
-No, it's locked.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.581
-Okay, where's the key?
-It's a temporal lock

08:35.648 --> 08:38.517
tied in with
the rift frequencies
at the hospital.

08:38.584 --> 08:40.853
-Oh.
-As the rift nears completion,

08:40.920 --> 08:43.456
the box will open
and we'll find out
exactly what Tommy does.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.258
But why would they keep us
in the dark, Jack?

08:45.324 --> 08:48.594
I guess we'll
find that out, too.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.696
Ta-dah!

08:50.763 --> 08:54.433
-Seriously, what do you think?
-You look like a film star.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.769
-Who, Charlie Chaplin?
-Come on.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.375
Jack, have you got any more
of those pretty
boys in the freezer?

09:02.441 --> 09:05.378
Hands off, missy.
Tosh got there first.

09:05.444 --> 09:07.380
Thanks for holding the fort
while I'm out.

09:07.446 --> 09:10.583
No worries, have fun.
Be careful.

09:10.650 --> 09:14.253
-Where are you off?
-Drink, film, maybe a pizza...

09:14.320 --> 09:16.222
-Oh, very nice.
-Very nice. Very nice.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.157
I'll be on
the mobile if you need me.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.959
-Have a lovely time.
-Bye.

He's a frozen
soldier from 1918.

TOSHIKO: Slow down.
What's the hurry?

09:31.170 --> 09:34.273
TOMMY: I've only got one day,
I want to see everything.

09:34.340 --> 09:39.145
TOSHIKO: Captain Scott. Sailed
from here when he went off
to the Antarctic.

09:39.211 --> 09:43.883
1910. I was 16.
Papers were full of it.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.386
Took him two
years to get there
and then he snuffed it.

09:49.488 --> 09:52.124
So, what've you been up to
since I last saw you?

09:52.191 --> 09:54.660
Oh, this and that.
Work mostly.

(TOMMY LAUGHS)

09:57.563 --> 09:59.832
-What?
-I knew you were
going to say that.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.435
It's what you always say.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.337
So how's
the piano playing going?

10:04.403 --> 10:06.072
That's what you said
last year, remember?

10:06.138 --> 10:09.041
-"I'm going to
learn the piano."
-Never got round to it.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.544
-I bet you never
learnt Spanish neither.
-I bought a book, though.

10:11.610 --> 10:14.280
Oh,
what are you, made of money?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.115
I haven't had time.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.218
You talk about your life
like you've got
no control over it.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.687
Well,
Torchwood's pretty much 24/7.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.525
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

10:26.592 --> 10:30.563
But you weren't conscripted.
I mean,
it's your choice, right?

10:31.831 --> 10:33.933
Yeah, I suppose it is.

-He's the boss.

-Nothing changes.
-She's all right, too.

after that was taken.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.085

-Ah, so you haven't, then.

down the hospital?
-Yeah, that's what they said.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.559
Could that have triggered
the time shift?

Could have. Maybe all

they told me it was all over.

16:25.451 --> 16:29.755
We won.
"The war to end
all wars," they said.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.192
And then three weeks later,
you had the Second World War.

16:34.693 --> 16:35.961
After all that.

16:47.439 --> 16:50.075
Do you never wonder
if we're worth saving?

16:50.142 --> 16:54.580
-The human race?
-Yes,
I think we're worth saving.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.048
Wars and all.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.186
What?

17:03.021 --> 17:04.123
What?

17:05.524 --> 17:09.361
I was just thinking,
I'd do anything for you.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.665
Yeah,
all you have to do is say,

17:13.732 --> 17:17.736
"Tommy, you're my brave,
handsome hero
and I need you."

17:17.803 --> 17:20.739
-Is that all?
-And whatever it is,
I'll do it.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.842
I mean it. Anything.

17:32.684 --> 17:36.655

-I don't know.

-I don't mean you any harm.

-Nothing.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.784
I know it's silly,

22:01.253 --> 22:02.788
but I'm a bit older than you.

22:02.854 --> 22:05.157
I was born in 1894.

22:05.223 --> 22:08.160
You know what I mean.

22:08.226 --> 22:12.631
So I'm old enough to die
for my country but I'm
too young to give you a kiss?

Thanks.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.577
You're welcome.

22:27.846 --> 22:31.249
I might be young,
but I've seen
a fair bit in my time.

22:33.351 --> 22:35.921
So what do you want to do now?

22:35.987 --> 22:37.956
Well,
we could go back to mine,

22:38.023 --> 22:41.259
but there's only room for one
and it's bloody freezing.

22:44.496 --> 22:46.698
You want to come
back to my place?

22:46.765 --> 22:49.868
I'm hardly rushing you.
You've known me four years.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.369
Four days.

Okay. Let's go.

23:21.366 --> 23:24.069
We're on our way.

23:26.938 --> 23:29.474
Demolishing the hospital
is what triggers
the time shift.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.476
-So, don't demolish it.
-Too late,
it's already started.

23:31.543 --> 23:33.145
What happens next?

23:33.211 --> 23:35.680
Two different times
should never
exist simultaneously.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.383
You want to be in 1918 or now.
Not both.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.185
So when 1918 becomes
fully manifest...

23:40.252 --> 23:41.820
It's really
going to screw us up.

Okay.

Linear time.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.794
Screwed up time.

23:48.860 --> 23:52.063
Imagine your life
as a straight line,
from birth to death.

23:52.130 --> 23:55.867
Now try drawing
that line on the paper
without straightening it out.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.469
It's impossible.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.771
That's why we've
got to stop it.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.877
-Ianto, is that box
doing anything yet?
-Still locked.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.313

get some idea when
it's gonna complete.

Tosh,
Owen, go to the hospital,
we need readings.

24:12.584 --> 24:15.320
Cover the place
with rift monitors.
Gwen, go through the files,

24:15.387 --> 24:17.956
see if there's
anything we missed.

-Need a hand?
-Just a couple more.

24:33.171 --> 24:36.174

I've been meaning to say

24:37.342 --> 24:40.245
just be careful.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.547

24:42.614 --> 24:45.483
You're very close to Tommy.

-I've only known
him for four days.
-Yeah.

24:48.687 --> 24:52.224
You've fallen for him,
haven't you?

24:52.290 --> 24:56.194
I can be myself with him.
I don't have to pretend.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.662

In the Torchwood
1918 field report
of the hospital

25:31.129 --> 25:34.599
they describe a certain detail
of their encounter.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.968
It reads,

<i>must have been traffic.</i>

And Toshiko.

27:43.294 --> 27:46.965
In 12 hours, there'll be
a brief moment
when both times exist,

27:47.032 --> 27:50.635
before the time
shift completes,
when Tommy can be here now

27:50.702 --> 27:52.871
and in 1918.

27:52.937 --> 27:56.307
He needs to be in the hospital
ready to step from
one time to another.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.510
So he'd be right
inside the time shift?

27:58.576 --> 28:01.112
And he can close
the fracture that caused it.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.313
And when the fracture's
closed?

28:02.380 --> 28:05.150

where it belongs.

This is a rift manipulator.
It's basically a key.

28:43.321 --> 28:47.692
Once you're inside the time
shift, you can close
the door behind you.

28:47.759 --> 28:50.562
And that's it? I'm gone?

Tosh, with me.

Three weeks
after we send
Tommy back, he dies.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.492
-How?
-He's shot by a firing squad.

29:22.293 --> 29:24.596
I don't understand.

29:24.662 --> 29:27.232
In 1918, Tommy was
suffering from shellshock.

29:27.298 --> 29:29.501
That's why he was
in the hospital.

29:29.567 --> 29:34.639
When Torchwood took him
and froze him, they froze his
most recent memories.

29:34.706 --> 29:39.210
When he returns to 1918,
he'll revert
back to who he was.

29:40.845 --> 29:44.182
He'll be shellshocked
and so he'll be executed

29:44.249 --> 29:46.951
by the British
army for cowardice.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.786
They can't shoot him for that.

29:48.853 --> 29:51.322
Lots of soldiers who were
shellshocked recovered enough

29:51.389 --> 29:54.659
to be sent back to the front.

29:54.726 --> 29:59.030
But once they were there,
they broke down again.

30:01.399 --> 30:04.736
-So they kill him?
-More than 300 of them.

30:04.802 --> 30:06.471
-Then we can't send him back.
-We have to.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.474
-I can't do that.
-Yes, you can.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.509
-He trusts you.
-To send him to his death?

30:11.576 --> 30:15.346
To help him save the future.
It has to be you.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.955
We kept these in the archives.

30:24.022 --> 30:28.293
You were wearing
them in the hospital
when Torchwood took you.

30:34.365 --> 30:37.135
Good job the moths
haven't got into them.

30:46.444 --> 30:49.714
So I'll be saving
the world in some pyjamas?

30:49.781 --> 30:51.182
How daft is that?

30:53.685 --> 30:56.187
Torchwood 1918 saw you
with Tommy in the hospital

30:56.254 --> 30:58.957
telling him what to do.

30:59.023 --> 31:02.660
I know you,
you're strong
enough to do this.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.972
Does Tommy know
what happens to him?

31:16.374 --> 31:19.711
-No.
-If he asks me, what do I say?

31:24.649 --> 31:27.418
-Where's Toshiko?
-Still in with Jack.

31:27.485 --> 31:29.821

31:31.389 --> 31:33.057
What time is it now?

31:33.858 --> 31:35.226
8:50.

31:36.461 --> 31:38.496
So what do we do till then?

31:44.902 --> 31:47.472
You don't know, do you?

31:47.538 --> 31:50.942
What would you like to do?

31:51.009 --> 31:54.912
The night before we went
over the top,
we used to play cards.

31:54.979 --> 31:57.348
Write letters.
Have a drink if
anyone had some.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.951
-Well, we could do that.
-Yeah.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.120
But you're not coming with me.

32:02.186 --> 32:03.855
I'm going on my own.

32:11.496 --> 32:14.799
We were just wondering
what Tommy should do tonight.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.770
He can come home with me.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.741
He's not our prisoner,
he doesn't have to stay here.

32:25.443 --> 32:26.511
Does he?

32:28.446 --> 32:29.547
No.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.852
If that's what you both want.

32:39.824 --> 32:41.559
Tomorrow morning, 6:30.

32:53.604 --> 32:56.407
-Come in.
-You're very neat.

32:57.742 --> 33:01.145
Yes,
well, there's only me here.

33:01.212 --> 33:04.782
And me. Just for tonight.

33:05.850 --> 33:09.387
Then I'll be gone.

33:09.454 --> 33:13.157
I never thought it
would really happen.

33:13.224 --> 33:15.493
I won't even be
able to write to you.

33:16.961 --> 33:19.030
You're going to
be so far away.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.934
I worried you'd
see me getting old.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.759
This time tomorrow,
he'll be back in 1918.

33:50.161 --> 33:51.863
In his own time.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.969
Would you go back to yours?
If you could.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.507
Why? Would you miss me?

34:02.573 --> 34:03.541
Yep.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.212
I left home a long time ago.

34:09.580 --> 34:13.084
I don't really know
where I really belong.

34:13.151 --> 34:15.486
Maybe that
doesn't matter any more.

34:16.954 --> 34:19.857
I know you get lonely.

34:22.126 --> 34:26.597
Going home wouldn't fix that.

34:26.664 --> 34:31.002
Being here, I've seen things
I never dreamt I'd see.

34:31.068 --> 34:35.339
Loved people I never would
have known if I'd just
stayed where I was.

34:37.542 --> 34:40.244
And I wouldn't
change that for the world.

-No. I know what'll happen.

-We belong here.
-I'm sorry.

Do you know that?

You save us all.

are forcing the rift open.

we can use it
to our advantage.

exact location in time.

you through to him.
