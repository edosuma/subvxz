MARK:
It was never that serious.

15:07.967 --> 15:09.467
Was it, between you and Freddie.

15:09.467 --> 15:12.567
Oh, no, nothing like when
Mark and I got together.

15:14.200 --> 15:18.067
So, it was you who ended
the relationship with Freddie.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.733
Um, it just sort of fizzled out.

15:20.733 --> 15:23.567
Um, when Freddie's depression
got really bad,

15:23.567 --> 15:25.700
he couldn't see the point
in anything,

15:25.700 --> 15:27.967
especially a girlfriend.

15:27.967 --> 15:29.667
MARK: Freddie had a lot of stuff
on his mind.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.867
We were the least
of his concerns.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.800
Are you talking about
his mental illness

15:34.800 --> 15:37.367
or his -- his conflict
with Leshae?

15:42.633 --> 15:44.500
ROB:
Appreciate the time.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.800
So, your mate Nazeeb

15:49.800 --> 15:52.433
said that you and Freddie
had a major bust-up.

15:52.433 --> 15:54.567
Do you want to tell me
what that was all about?

15:57.933 --> 15:59.400
The guy was selfish.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.500
I reached a tipping point.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.867
That's it.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.333
What can you tell me
about the bar fight

16:07.333 --> 16:08.800
between Leshae and Freddie?

16:08.800 --> 16:11.667
It was just whatever was going
on in the house spilled over.

16:13.700 --> 16:14.800
Mark?

16:15.700 --> 16:17.733
Or maybe something at college.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.133
But I really don't know.

16:20.133 --> 16:23.433
I was in a completely
different department, so...

16:23.433 --> 16:26.200
So Leshae and Freddie
were in the same course?

16:27.067 --> 16:29.133
Yeah.
History.

16:30.267 --> 16:32.767
But as I said,
I really don't know

16:32.767 --> 16:34.333
if that was anything
to do with it.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.400
I was drunk.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.300
He'd been drinking,
and he probably shouldn't

16:43.300 --> 16:46.300
'cause he must have been
on some serious meds.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.367
Look, we sorted it out.

16:48.367 --> 16:51.067
But the damage was done.
I had to go.

16:51.067 --> 16:53.800
So you had a good room
in a good place,

16:53.800 --> 16:55.900
and you walked away
from 200 quid rent

16:55.900 --> 16:57.833
you'd already paid.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.100
You need to help me out
with this.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.700
Look, I wasn't even in the house
when Freddie was --

17:02.633 --> 17:04.367
When you say he died.

17:04.367 --> 17:06.067
You think I was that angry
that I came back

17:06.067 --> 17:09.166

in the ground over dirty dishes.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.567
You're crazy, man.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.700
How old do you think
Justine and Mark's baby is?

17:29.933 --> 17:32.233
10 months, a year?

17:32.233 --> 17:35.333
Patrick Lewis from Leshae
and Freddie's history course

17:35.333 --> 17:37.500
said that when Freddie
was in his manic phase,

17:37.500 --> 17:38.800
his spending went up.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.733
So, he'd fund himself by writing
other people's essays.

17:41.733 --> 17:44.267
He thinks Leshae
might have been a customer.

17:44.267 --> 17:46.233
That was helpful of Mark
to let us know

17:46.233 --> 17:47.767
they were both
in the same course.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.900
Leshae was caught plagiarizing.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.633
He was lucky
not to get thrown out.

18:06.867 --> 18:09.900
Look, I paid him, and he copied
the damn thing off the Internet.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.067
So I punched him.

18:11.067 --> 18:12.567
That was the entire extent
of my anger.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.067
They only let me stay
on the course

18:19.067 --> 18:21.100
'cause I bleeding-hearted about
being the first in my family

18:21.100 --> 18:22.333

and keep it down.

18:29.667 --> 18:32.300
But hearing what happened
in that flat when I left...

18:33.733 --> 18:34.800
Like what?

18:36.100 --> 18:38.967
Just that it got really messy
with Mark and Justine there.

18:40.967 --> 18:44.367
When Freddie and Justine split,
was that a mutual decision?

18:44.367 --> 18:47.333
No.
No, Freddie ended it.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.067
Justine was broken up.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.867
Mark was her shoulder to cry on.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.767
I guess he got the girl
in the end, but...

18:52.767 --> 18:55.533
it was still awkward
with Freddie there.

18:58.533 --> 19:00.233
So, what was the plan?

19:02.567 --> 19:05.600
To get Freddie to move out
of his own accord.

19:06.333 --> 19:07.533
VIVIENNE: How?

19:35.067 --> 19:37.533
Poor guy's terrified.

19:37.533 --> 19:40.133
Leshae said they let Freddie
fumble around the house

19:40.133 --> 19:43.967
in the darkness for a couple
of minutes, scared stupid.

19:43.967 --> 19:46.700

and flicks the fuse back on.

19:49.467 --> 19:51.767
Crucified him, mate.

He'll be out, and you'll
be back in, no worries.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.533
Yeah, I know.
I'm really proud of myself.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.300
But the power-cut stuff?

20:17.500 --> 20:19.200
That was too much.

20:20.533 --> 20:22.767
He was afraid of the dark.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.533
And he was ill.

20:29.767 --> 20:32.067
That was affecting his health.

20:32.067 --> 20:34.167
Do you think they knew that?

20:35.933 --> 20:38.600
I think Mark did.

Freddie's sister got Freddie
to go back on his meds

20:41.100 --> 20:42.767

20:44.567 --> 20:47.333
Mark got impatient
waiting for them to kick in.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.500
There was no improvement?

20:52.700 --> 20:54.167
Maybe a bit.

20:55.067 --> 20:56.600
But then he got worse.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.400
More manic, more paranoid.

Mark said I should tell him

...he was gone.

21:19.167 --> 21:21.567

21:21.567 --> 21:24.433
There were traces
of Freddie's prescribed meds,

21:24.433 --> 21:27.200
but there was also
anther drug called Teliphynide.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.867
Oh, don't ask me to spell that.

21:28.867 --> 21:31.100
It's a severe asthma drug,

for his drugs.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.367
