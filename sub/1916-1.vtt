WEBVTT

02:16.612 --> 02:19.376
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

02:19.482 --> 02:21.609
Very good, Lieutenant.

03:13.336 --> 03:15.167
We made it.

03:18.608 --> 03:20.371
I guess I was wrong.

03:20.476 --> 03:22.671
There was no danger at all.

03:41.531 --> 03:43.158
Cordиж.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.469
Milady, I'm so sorry.

03:48.371 --> 03:50.464
I've failed you, Senator.

03:50.573 --> 03:51.699
No.

03:54.877 --> 03:57.368
Milady, you're still in danger here.

04:03.853 --> 04:07.118
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

04:07.423 --> 04:11.052
You did your duty.
Cordиж did hers. Now, come.

04:12.929 --> 04:15.022
Senator Amidala, please.

04:26.609 --> 04:29.703
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

04:30.513 --> 04:33.346
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

04:33.449 --> 04:35.280
If they do break away...

04:35.384 --> 04:38.649
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

04:38.754 --> 04:40.813
be split in two.

04:40.923 --> 04:43.892
My negotiations will not fail.

04:44.226 --> 04:46.558
If they do, you must realize...

04:46.696 --> 04:48.755
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

04:49.699 --> 04:52.395
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

04:53.869 --> 04:55.564
Master Yoda...

04:56.539 --> 04:59.201
do you think it will
really come to war?

05:00.710 --> 05:05.010
The dark side clouds everything.

05:05.114 --> 05:10.074
Impossible to see the future is.

05:11.921 --> 05:15.152
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

05:15.257 --> 05:16.246
Good.

05:18.794 --> 05:20.955
Send them in.

05:21.063 --> 05:23.896
We will discuss this matter later.

05:28.104 --> 05:31.972
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...

05:32.074 --> 05:33.974
terrible.

05:34.243 --> 05:37.872
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

05:37.980 --> 05:40.710
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

05:40.816 --> 05:45.412
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

05:46.322 --> 05:48.381
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

05:48.491 --> 05:52.393
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

05:52.495 --> 05:55.487
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

05:55.598 --> 05:59.056
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

05:59.168 --> 06:01.728
But for certain, Senator...

06:01.837 --> 06:05.671
in grave danger you are.

06:06.842 --> 06:09.743
MasterJedi, may I suggest...

06:09.845 --> 06:13.941
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

06:14.050 --> 06:17.110
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

06:17.219 --> 06:19.346
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

06:19.455 --> 06:21.787
The situation is that serious?

06:22.358 --> 06:24.349
No, but I do, Senator.

06:24.460 --> 06:27.793
I realize all too well
that additional security...

06:27.897 --> 06:31.389
might be disruptive for you...

06:31.500 --> 06:34.162
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

06:34.503 --> 06:38.303
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

06:39.175 --> 06:40.699
That's possible.

06:40.810 --> 06:43.540
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

06:44.714 --> 06:46.841
Do it for me, milady. Please?

06:46.949 --> 06:49.349
The thought of losing you...

06:51.087 --> 06:53.146
is unbearable.

06:54.023 --> 06:57.220
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

06:57.326 --> 06:59.556
Thank you, Master Windu.

07:08.704 --> 07:12.470
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

07:12.575 --> 07:16.204
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

07:16.946 --> 07:18.937
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

07:19.048 --> 07:21.482
and I rescued you, remember?

07:21.951 --> 07:23.976
Oh... yes.

07:29.425 --> 07:33.486
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

07:34.530 --> 07:36.691
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

07:51.380 --> 07:54.110
Obi? Obi!

07:54.216 --> 07:57.879
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again, JarJar.

07:57.987 --> 07:59.978
Senator Padmиж.

08:00.089 --> 08:03.684
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

08:03.793 --> 08:06.523
Desa Jedi arriven.

08:10.399 --> 08:13.095
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.693
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

08:17.072 --> 08:18.505
Ani?

08:18.607 --> 08:21.906
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

08:22.011 --> 08:24.411
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

08:24.513 --> 08:27.209
Well, for a senator, I mean.

08:29.585 --> 08:32.712
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

08:34.289 --> 08:37.748
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

08:37.860 --> 08:40.328
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.488
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

08:42.597 --> 08:44.725
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

08:44.834 --> 08:47.598
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

08:47.703 --> 08:50.399
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

08:50.506 --> 08:52.736
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

08:52.842 --> 08:56.676
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

08:56.779 --> 08:59.179
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmиж.

08:59.281 --> 09:01.112
I promise you.

09:01.217 --> 09:03.947
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

09:04.053 --> 09:07.022
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

09:07.156 --> 09:09.624
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

09:09.725 --> 09:11.693
and you will pay attention
to my lead.

09:11.794 --> 09:13.853
- Why?
- What?

09:15.731 --> 09:19.462
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

09:19.568 --> 09:22.867
Protection is a job
for local security, notJedi.

09:22.972 --> 09:25.805
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

09:25.908 --> 09:29.173
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.672
And you will learn
your place, young one.

09:38.187 --> 09:40.212
Perhaps with merely your presence...

09:40.322 --> 09:43.257
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

09:43.359 --> 09:45.953
Now, if you'll excuse me...

09:46.195 --> 09:47.890
I will retire.

09:49.265 --> 09:51.324
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

09:51.433 --> 09:53.594
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

09:53.702 --> 09:55.863
and I'll be in the control center
downstairs.

09:57.506 --> 10:00.498
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

10:00.609 --> 10:03.737
She hardly even
recognized me, JarJar.

10:05.381 --> 10:08.316
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

10:09.685 --> 10:11.653
she's forgotten me completely.

10:11.754 --> 10:13.415
Shesa happy.

10:13.522 --> 10:15.922
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

10:16.025 --> 10:19.825
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

10:20.129 --> 10:22.597
She was pleased to see us.

10:22.698 --> 10:24.666
Now, let's check the security.

10:33.609 --> 10:35.770
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

10:35.878 --> 10:38.142
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

10:38.247 --> 10:40.272
My client is getting impatient.

10:40.382 --> 10:43.215
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

10:43.319 --> 10:46.755
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

10:50.092 --> 10:52.526
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

10:52.628 --> 10:54.562
No assassin would try that way.

10:55.130 --> 10:57.690
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

10:59.234 --> 11:02.067
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

11:02.438 --> 11:05.703
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

11:06.442 --> 11:08.467
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

11:08.577 --> 11:10.477
What is she thinking?

11:10.579 --> 11:13.571
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

11:13.682 --> 11:16.310
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

11:16.418 --> 11:20.752
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

11:22.858 --> 11:24.985
You're using her as bait.

11:25.094 --> 11:27.153
It was her idea.

11:27.262 --> 11:29.822
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

11:29.932 --> 11:32.901
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

11:33.002 --> 11:35.266
Trust me.

11:35.371 --> 11:37.271
It's too risky.

11:37.773 --> 11:40.970
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

11:41.377 --> 11:43.402
And yours are?

11:45.614 --> 11:47.479
Possibly.

12:01.830 --> 12:03.798
You look tired.

12:04.533 --> 12:06.524
I don't sleep well anymore.

12:06.635 --> 12:09.126
Because of your mother?

12:14.309 --> 12:17.107
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

12:19.848 --> 12:21.782
Dreams pass in time.

12:23.352 --> 12:25.912
I'd much rather dream about Padmиж.

12:26.021 --> 12:30.219
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

12:30.325 --> 12:32.793
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

12:32.895 --> 12:35.227
You've made a commitment
to theJedi order...

12:35.330 --> 12:37.389
a commitment not easily broken.

12:37.499 --> 12:40.263
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

12:40.369 --> 12:42.963
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

12:43.072 --> 12:45.199
It is my experience
that senators focus...

12:45.340 --> 12:48.207
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

12:48.944 --> 12:52.505
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

12:52.614 --> 12:54.809
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

12:54.917 --> 12:57.715
At least not
on the economics of politics.

13:53.342 --> 13:56.072
And besides, you're generalizing.

13:56.178 --> 13:58.237
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

13:58.347 --> 14:00.008
Palpatine is a politician.

14:00.115 --> 14:02.743
I have observed
that he is very clever...

14:02.851 --> 14:06.844
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

14:06.955 --> 14:08.820
I think he's a good man...

14:08.924 --> 14:10.824
I sense it too.

14:27.342 --> 14:30.004
Stay here!

14:32.447 --> 14:34.347
Are you all right, milady?

15:08.817 --> 15:10.011
What the...

15:18.660 --> 15:20.321
Jedi poo doo!

16:22.157 --> 16:24.455
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

16:24.559 --> 16:27.460
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

16:27.562 --> 16:30.963
With the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

16:31.066 --> 16:33.864
If you spent as long practicing your
saber techniques as you do your wit...

16:33.969 --> 16:35.698
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

16:35.804 --> 16:37.499
I thought I already did.

16:37.606 --> 16:40.302
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

17:08.804 --> 17:11.238
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

17:18.347 --> 17:20.473
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

17:20.615 --> 17:23.846
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

17:23.952 --> 17:26.750
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

17:55.050 --> 17:58.019
Anakin! How many times
have I told you...

17:59.221 --> 18:01.348
stay away from power couplings!

18:03.024 --> 18:04.355
That was good!

18:19.908 --> 18:22.433
Where are you going?
He went that way.

18:22.544 --> 18:24.569
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

18:24.679 --> 18:26.670
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

18:26.782 --> 18:31.082
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

18:31.186 --> 18:33.848
This is a shortcut... I think.

19:01.650 --> 19:03.515
Well, you've lost him.

19:04.052 --> 19:06.111
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

19:06.221 --> 19:08.121
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

19:08.223 --> 19:10.657
He went completely the other way.

19:10.759 --> 19:12.784
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

19:15.330 --> 19:17.924
I hate it when he does that.

21:46.948 --> 21:48.711
Anakin!

21:48.817 --> 21:51.650
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

21:51.753 --> 21:55.280
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

21:55.390 --> 21:58.154
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

21:58.259 --> 22:01.057
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

22:01.162 --> 22:05.098
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

22:05.233 --> 22:07.895
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

22:08.003 --> 22:09.698
Don't say that, Master.

22:09.804 --> 22:11.863
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

22:11.973 --> 22:13.838
Then why don't you listen to me?

22:13.942 --> 22:15.534
I am trying.

22:27.656 --> 22:29.590
Can you see him?

22:29.691 --> 22:31.659
I think he is a she...

22:31.760 --> 22:34.422
and I think she is a changeling.

22:35.030 --> 22:37.658
In that case, be extra careful.

22:39.701 --> 22:42.169
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

22:42.270 --> 22:43.737
For a drink.

22:54.315 --> 22:56.146
Thank you.

22:56.885 --> 23:00.343
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

23:00.455 --> 23:02.389
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

23:02.490 --> 23:04.583
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

23:04.693 --> 23:07.025
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

23:55.210 --> 23:56.507
Easy.

23:56.611 --> 23:58.738
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

24:05.386 --> 24:08.014
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

24:08.690 --> 24:10.419
It was a senator from Naboo.

24:10.525 --> 24:13.221
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

24:14.362 --> 24:16.592
Who hired you? Tell us.

24:18.099 --> 24:20.090
Tell us now!

24:21.069 --> 24:22.900
It was a bounty hunter called...

24:28.209 --> 24:32.669
Wee shahnit... sleemo.

24:42.257 --> 24:44.088
Toxic dart.

24:54.502 --> 24:58.563
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

24:58.673 --> 25:02.131
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

25:02.243 --> 25:06.145
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

25:06.247 --> 25:09.148
Handle that your Padawan will.

25:10.919 --> 25:14.548
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

25:14.656 --> 25:18.387
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

25:18.493 --> 25:20.484
Travel as refugees.

25:20.595 --> 25:23.496
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

25:23.598 --> 25:25.964
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

25:26.935 --> 25:29.768
Until caught this killer is...

25:29.871 --> 25:32.931
our judgment she must respect.

25:33.374 --> 25:35.501
Anakin, go to the senate...

25:35.610 --> 25:38.773
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

25:47.689 --> 25:49.623
I will talk with her.

25:49.724 --> 25:52.852
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

25:52.961 --> 25:55.122
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

25:55.230 --> 25:57.289
Thank you, Your Excellency.

25:57.398 --> 26:00.765
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

26:01.836 --> 26:03.861
Your patience has paid off.

26:04.005 --> 26:06.303
Your guidance
more than my patience.

26:07.475 --> 26:09.807
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

26:11.145 --> 26:14.137
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

26:16.084 --> 26:18.177
Then you will be invincible.

26:21.322 --> 26:23.222
I have said it many times:

26:23.324 --> 26:26.088
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

26:26.194 --> 26:28.094
Thank you, Your Excellency.

26:28.196 --> 26:31.893
I see you becoming the greatest
of all theJedi, Anakin...

26:32.000 --> 26:34.525
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

26:39.707 --> 26:41.732
I am concerned for my Padawan.

26:41.843 --> 26:44.539
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

26:44.679 --> 26:47.910
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

26:48.016 --> 26:49.984
The boy has exceptional skills.

26:50.084 --> 26:52.518
But he still has much to learn, Master.

26:52.620 --> 26:56.056
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

26:56.190 --> 26:58.158
Yes.

26:58.259 --> 27:01.194
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

27:03.298 --> 27:05.698
Too sure of themselves they are.

27:05.800 --> 27:09.258
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

27:09.370 --> 27:12.931
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

27:13.041 --> 27:16.670
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

27:20.782 --> 27:23.615
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

27:23.718 --> 27:26.846
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

27:26.955 --> 27:29.856
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

27:29.958 --> 27:34.452
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

27:34.829 --> 27:39.129
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and...

27:39.233 --> 27:41.793
JarJar, I don't wish to hold you up.

27:41.903 --> 27:43.871
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

27:43.972 --> 27:45.769
Of course.

27:46.074 --> 27:47.632
Milady.

27:52.246 --> 27:54.111
I do not like this idea of hiding.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.311
Don't worry.

27:56.417 --> 27:58.612
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

27:58.753 --> 28:01.415
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

28:01.522 --> 28:04.423
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

28:04.525 --> 28:06.584
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

28:06.694 --> 28:08.753
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

28:08.863 --> 28:11.423
and do what is requested of us.

28:11.532 --> 28:13.966
Anakin, you've grown up.

28:15.837 --> 28:18.271
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

28:25.146 --> 28:27.774
Don't get me wrong.

28:27.882 --> 28:29.713
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

28:29.817 --> 28:32.342
As wise as Master Yoda and...

28:32.453 --> 28:34.580
as powerful as Master Windu.

28:36.958 --> 28:39.358
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

28:41.529 --> 28:44.589
In some ways...
a lot of ways...

28:46.634 --> 28:48.602
I'm really ahead of him.

28:49.337 --> 28:51.202
I'm ready for the trials...

28:51.305 --> 28:54.706
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

28:54.809 --> 28:56.709
He won't let me move on.

28:57.578 --> 28:59.876
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

28:59.981 --> 29:02.779
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

29:02.884 --> 29:05.250
He doesn't understand.

29:05.353 --> 29:07.446
It's not fair!

29:07.555 --> 29:12.390
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

29:12.493 --> 29:14.484
It's the only way we grow.

29:16.597 --> 29:18.030
I know.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.991
Anakin...

29:23.371 --> 29:25.896
don't try to grow up too fast.

29:26.007 --> 29:27.998
But I am grown up.

29:30.111 --> 29:32.079
You said it yourself.

29:33.214 --> 29:35.307
Please don't look at me like that.

29:36.284 --> 29:37.774
Why not?

29:37.885 --> 29:40.012
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

29:42.023 --> 29:43.991
Sorry, milady.

29:59.273 --> 30:02.037
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

30:02.143 --> 30:05.203
Take good care of Dormиж.
The threat's on you two now.

30:05.313 --> 30:07.281
He'll be safe with me.

30:11.719 --> 30:13.346
You'll be fine.

30:13.454 --> 30:16.651
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

30:16.757 --> 30:19.089
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

30:20.261 --> 30:23.560
Well, then myJedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

30:23.664 --> 30:25.564
Anakin...

30:25.666 --> 30:28.760
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

30:28.903 --> 30:30.803
Yes, Master.

30:31.973 --> 30:34.498
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

30:34.609 --> 30:36.543
You'll be back here in no time.

30:36.644 --> 30:39.875
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, MasterJedi.

30:39.981 --> 30:41.881
- It's time to go.
- I know.

30:41.983 --> 30:44.508
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

30:44.619 --> 30:46.644
May the Force be with you, Master.

30:58.132 --> 30:59.997
Suddenly I'm afraid.

31:00.101 --> 31:03.730
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.267
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

31:13.648 --> 31:16.173
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

31:16.951 --> 31:20.409
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

31:41.842 --> 31:43.935
Someone to see ya, honey!

31:44.378 --> 31:46.278
Jedi, by the looks of him.

31:47.348 --> 31:48.940
Obi-Wan!

31:50.017 --> 31:51.314
Hello, Dex.

31:51.419 --> 31:54.013
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

31:56.424 --> 31:59.393
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

32:04.065 --> 32:06.226
Old buddy!

32:15.610 --> 32:18.579
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

32:18.679 --> 32:20.510
You can tell me what this is.

32:22.016 --> 32:25.247
Well, whattaya know!

32:25.353 --> 32:27.753
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

32:27.888 --> 32:31.085
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

32:31.192 --> 32:33.626
Can you tell me
where it came from?

32:33.728 --> 32:36.697
This baby belongs to them cloners.

32:36.797 --> 32:41.131
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

32:41.235 --> 32:44.204
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

32:44.305 --> 32:47.604
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

32:47.708 --> 32:51.610
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

32:51.746 --> 32:54.010
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

32:54.115 --> 32:56.447
for the difference
between knowledge and...

32:57.618 --> 32:59.279
wisdom.

32:59.387 --> 33:01.378
Well, if droids could think...

33:01.489 --> 33:03.548
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

33:04.292 --> 33:06.487
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

33:06.594 --> 33:08.562
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

33:08.663 --> 33:14.295
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

33:14.402 --> 33:18.930
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

33:19.907 --> 33:24.640
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

33:24.745 --> 33:27.612
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

33:28.783 --> 33:31.877
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

33:32.286 --> 33:34.220
Depends on what, Dex?

33:34.322 --> 33:37.189
On how good your manners are...

33:37.291 --> 33:41.591
and how big your... pocketbook is.

33:52.340 --> 33:55.036
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

33:55.142 --> 33:57.269
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

33:57.378 --> 34:00.677
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

34:00.781 --> 34:03.045
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

34:03.150 --> 34:07.450
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

34:07.555 --> 34:09.920
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

34:10.024 --> 34:13.016
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

34:13.127 --> 34:15.186
just south of the Rishi Maze.

34:22.136 --> 34:25.469
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

34:25.572 --> 34:27.268
doesn't exist.

34:27.375 --> 34:30.867
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

34:30.978 --> 34:34.038
If an item does not appear
in our records...

34:34.148 --> 34:36.206
it does not exist.

34:58.005 --> 35:00.235
Hey, you! No droids!

35:00.608 --> 35:02.508
Get outta here!

35:09.350 --> 35:11.215
Thank you, R2.

35:12.019 --> 35:14.920
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to theJedi...

35:15.022 --> 35:18.924
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

35:19.026 --> 35:21.153
Or be with the people that I love.

35:22.096 --> 35:24.121
Are you allowed to love?

35:24.231 --> 35:26.062
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

35:29.603 --> 35:31.901
Attachment is forbidden.

35:33.707 --> 35:35.607
Possession is forbidden.

35:35.709 --> 35:39.304
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

35:39.413 --> 35:41.847
is central to a Jedi's life.

35:44.318 --> 35:48.687
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

35:48.789 --> 35:50.723
You've changed so much.

35:50.825 --> 35:53.385
You haven't changed a bit.

35:53.494 --> 35:56.361
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

36:09.009 --> 36:12.740
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

36:12.847 --> 36:15.543
Use your feelings you must.

36:19.954 --> 36:22.980
Younglings. Younglings!

36:23.090 --> 36:25.524
A visitor we have.

36:25.626 --> 36:28.493
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

36:28.629 --> 36:30.062
Hello.

36:30.164 --> 36:31.688
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

36:31.799 --> 36:34.131
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

36:35.603 --> 36:38.504
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

36:38.606 --> 36:41.734
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

36:43.310 --> 36:46.177
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.248
How embarrassing!

36:51.685 --> 36:53.676
Liam, the shades.

36:55.055 --> 36:57.523
Gather round the map reader.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.786
Clear your minds...

36:59.894 --> 37:03.352
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

37:04.565 --> 37:07.728
It ought to be here...

37:07.835 --> 37:09.735
but it isn't.

37:09.837 --> 37:13.273
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

37:14.875 --> 37:16.968
Gravity's silhouette remains...

37:17.077 --> 37:20.046
but the star and all the planets...

37:20.147 --> 37:22.138
disappeared they have.

37:22.249 --> 37:24.376
How can this be?

37:25.586 --> 37:27.213
A thought?

37:28.155 --> 37:30.020
Anyone.

37:30.491 --> 37:31.924
Master?

37:32.026 --> 37:34.893
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

37:38.232 --> 37:42.134
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

37:45.039 --> 37:47.269
The Padawan is right.

37:47.374 --> 37:50.434
Go to the center of gravity's pull...

37:50.544 --> 37:54.002
and find your planet you will.

37:59.420 --> 38:02.412
The data must have been erased.

38:02.856 --> 38:07.623
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

38:07.728 --> 38:11.129
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

38:11.231 --> 38:15.600
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

38:15.703 --> 38:19.104
But who and why, harder to answer.

38:20.207 --> 38:23.040
Meditate on this I will.

38:47.901 --> 38:50.199
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

38:50.304 --> 38:53.899
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

38:54.008 --> 38:55.976
I'm not sure I was ready.

38:56.076 --> 38:58.601
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

38:59.013 --> 39:01.072
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

39:01.181 --> 39:03.240
so you could stay in office.

39:03.350 --> 39:05.841
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

39:05.953 --> 39:09.650
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

39:09.757 --> 39:11.748
I couldn't refuse her.

39:12.026 --> 39:15.393
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

39:17.498 --> 39:19.625
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

39:26.640 --> 39:30.201
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

39:30.310 --> 39:32.175
It's unthinkable!

39:32.279 --> 39:35.680
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

39:35.783 --> 39:38.251
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

39:38.352 --> 39:40.445
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

39:40.554 --> 39:42.749
Not if they feel threatened.

39:42.856 --> 39:46.223
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

39:46.326 --> 39:48.294
It's outrageous...

39:48.395 --> 39:50.693
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

39:50.798 --> 39:54.598
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

39:54.702 --> 39:58.695
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

40:00.841 --> 40:03.002
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

40:09.883 --> 40:13.944
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

40:14.054 --> 40:16.750
Let's pray that day never comes.

40:16.857 --> 40:19.519
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.624
What is your suggestion, MasterJedi?

40:22.730 --> 40:26.097
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.065
- But I was thinking...
- Hold on a minute.

40:28.168 --> 40:29.430
Excuse me.

40:29.536 --> 40:31.970
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

40:32.072 --> 40:34.302
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

40:34.408 --> 40:37.468
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

40:38.345 --> 40:41.246
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

40:41.348 --> 40:43.316
I think it would be wise...

40:43.417 --> 40:45.817
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

40:47.187 --> 40:49.087
Sorry, milady.

40:52.292 --> 40:54.419
Perfect. It's settled, then.

41:08.408 --> 41:11.138
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

41:11.245 --> 41:13.076
Our missing planet Kamino.

41:51.251 --> 41:53.116
MasterJedi.

41:54.254 --> 41:56.586
The prime minister is expecting you.

41:57.825 --> 42:00.225
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

42:01.128 --> 42:03.392
He is anxious to meet you.

42:03.497 --> 42:05.692
After all these years...

42:05.799 --> 42:09.394
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

42:09.503 --> 42:11.733
Now, please, this way.

42:24.518 --> 42:27.009
May I present Lama Su...

42:27.120 --> 42:29.145
prime minister of Kamino.

42:30.891 --> 42:32.950
And this is MasterJedi...

42:33.193 --> 42:35.093
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

42:35.195 --> 42:38.494
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

42:39.967 --> 42:41.935
Please.

42:43.570 --> 42:45.765
And now to business.

42:45.873 --> 42:49.809
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

42:50.911 --> 42:52.811
200,000 units are ready...

42:52.913 --> 42:55.279
with a million more
well on the way.

42:56.416 --> 42:58.384
That's good news.

42:58.485 --> 43:01.613
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

43:01.722 --> 43:05.089
that his order will be met on time.

43:05.192 --> 43:07.160
I'm sorry. Master...

43:08.328 --> 43:10.888
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

43:10.998 --> 43:14.126
a leading member of theJedi Council,
is he not?

43:14.234 --> 43:18.034
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

43:19.673 --> 43:22.005
I'm so sorry to hear that.

43:22.109 --> 43:26.409
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

43:26.513 --> 43:28.845
The army?

43:28.949 --> 43:32.612
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

43:32.719 --> 43:34.914
one of the finest we've ever created.

43:35.055 --> 43:37.023
Tell me, Prime Minister...

43:37.124 --> 43:39.615
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

43:39.726 --> 43:41.853
did he say who it was for?

43:41.962 --> 43:43.987
Of course he did.

43:44.097 --> 43:46.759
This army is for the Republic.

43:47.634 --> 43:51.229
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

43:52.806 --> 43:54.865
That's why I'm here.

44:15.729 --> 44:17.856
We used to come here
for school retreat.

44:19.599 --> 44:21.692
We would swim
to that island every day.

44:23.003 --> 44:24.971
I love the water.

44:29.743 --> 44:33.372
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

44:33.847 --> 44:36.816
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

44:39.686 --> 44:41.711
I don't like sand.

44:42.422 --> 44:46.153
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

44:46.526 --> 44:48.551
and it gets everywhere.

44:50.764 --> 44:52.789
Not like here.

44:53.433 --> 44:55.401
Here, everything is soft...

44:57.537 --> 44:59.732
and smooth.

45:36.309 --> 45:37.970
No.

45:38.645 --> 45:40.670
I shouldn't have done that.

45:42.416 --> 45:44.384
I'm sorry.

45:57.998 --> 45:59.625
Very impressive.

45:59.733 --> 46:01.860
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

46:05.005 --> 46:07.496
Clones can think creatively.

46:07.607 --> 46:11.509
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

46:15.282 --> 46:20.686
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

46:20.787 --> 46:24.154
This group was created
about five years ago.

46:24.257 --> 46:26.316
You mentioned growth acceleration.

46:26.426 --> 46:28.360
Oh, yes, it's essential.

46:28.462 --> 46:31.488
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

46:31.598 --> 46:34.192
Now we can do it in half the time.

46:34.301 --> 46:36.963
I see.

46:37.070 --> 46:38.970
They are totally obedient...

46:39.072 --> 46:41.768
taking any order without question.

46:41.875 --> 46:43.934
We modified their genetic structure...

46:44.044 --> 46:47.275
to make them less independent
than the original host.

46:47.380 --> 46:49.905
And who was the original host?

46:50.050 --> 46:52.109
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.813
And where is this bounty hunter now?

46:55.922 --> 46:58.049
Oh, we keep him here.

47:00.727 --> 47:03.560
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

47:03.663 --> 47:06.154
Fett demanded only one thing:

47:06.266 --> 47:08.860
An unaltered clone for himself.

47:08.969 --> 47:11.403
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

47:11.505 --> 47:14.030
Pure genetic replication.

47:14.141 --> 47:17.304
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

47:17.410 --> 47:19.970
and no growth acceleration.

47:20.080 --> 47:23.311
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

47:23.450 --> 47:26.715
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

47:44.304 --> 47:47.102
Magnificent, aren't they?

47:53.000 --> 47:54.865
I don't know.

47:56.070 --> 47:58.231
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

47:58.339 --> 48:00.705
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

48:00.808 --> 48:02.901
They only work on the weak-minded.

48:04.311 --> 48:05.972
All right.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.941
I was 12.
His name was Palo.

48:08.949 --> 48:10.840
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

48:10.951 --> 48:14.011
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

48:14.121 --> 48:16.987
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

48:16.990 --> 48:18.581
All right, I get the picture.

48:18.959 --> 48:21.359
Whatever happened to him?

48:21.461 --> 48:24.191
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

48:24.297 --> 48:26.356
Maybe he was the smart one.

48:26.466 --> 48:28.730
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

48:28.835 --> 48:30.996
I like two or three...

48:31.104 --> 48:33.163
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

48:37.184 --> 48:39.379
I don't think the system works.

48:39.486 --> 48:42.080
How would you have it work?

48:42.623 --> 48:46.423
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

48:46.860 --> 48:49.385
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

48:49.496 --> 48:50.961
and then do it.

48:50.965 --> 48:53.228
That's exactly what we do.

48:53.333 --> 48:55.324
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

48:55.469 --> 48:57.369
Well, then they should be made to.

48:57.471 --> 49:00.531
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

49:00.641 --> 49:02.666
- You?
- Of course not me.

49:02.809 --> 49:05.778
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

49:05.879 --> 49:09.679
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

49:11.184 --> 49:13.448
Well, if it works.

49:20.527 --> 49:22.324
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

49:22.429 --> 49:24.989
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

50:04.334 --> 50:06.825
Ani, are you all right?

50:43.172 --> 50:46.198
Boba, is your father here?

50:47.243 --> 50:48.232
Yep.

50:48.378 --> 50:50.403
May we see him?

50:51.047 --> 50:53.345
Sure.

50:54.951 --> 50:57.078
Dad, Taun We's here.

51:10.266 --> 51:12.734
Jango, welcome back.

51:13.069 --> 51:15.003
Was your trip productive?

51:15.104 --> 51:17.038
Fairly.

51:17.140 --> 51:20.974
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

51:21.077 --> 51:23.875
He's come to check on our progress.

51:24.213 --> 51:27.114
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

51:27.216 --> 51:30.208
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

51:30.320 --> 51:34.017
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

51:34.958 --> 51:37.017
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

51:39.162 --> 51:40.857
Possibly.

51:40.964 --> 51:43.057
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

51:47.670 --> 51:49.695
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

51:50.907 --> 51:52.306
Master who?

51:54.344 --> 51:56.369
Sifo-Dyas.

51:56.479 --> 51:59.107
Is he not theJedi
who hired you for this job?

52:02.085 --> 52:03.950
Never heard of him.

52:06.856 --> 52:07.948
Really?

52:09.092 --> 52:13.051
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

52:13.162 --> 52:14.789
Curious.

52:18.835 --> 52:21.065
Do you like your army?

52:21.871 --> 52:23.839
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

52:25.108 --> 52:28.509
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

52:28.611 --> 52:30.738
Thank you for your time, Jango.

52:32.515 --> 52:34.608
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

52:54.003 --> 52:56.267
What is it, Dad?

52:57.640 --> 52:59.631
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

53:04.380 --> 53:08.874
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

53:08.985 --> 53:11.010
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

53:11.120 --> 53:14.612
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

53:27.603 --> 53:30.731
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

54:00.103 --> 54:02.333
From the moment I met you...

54:03.439 --> 54:05.600
all those years ago...

54:06.042 --> 54:09.034
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

54:11.781 --> 54:14.181
And now that I'm with you again...

54:14.817 --> 54:16.910
I'm in agony.

54:20.323 --> 54:24.191
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

54:24.293 --> 54:26.727
The thought of not being with you...

54:27.597 --> 54:29.531
I can't breathe.

54:33.402 --> 54:35.336
I'm haunted by the kiss...

54:35.438 --> 54:38.407
that you should never have given me.

54:38.841 --> 54:41.173
My heart is beating...

54:41.277 --> 54:44.212
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

54:46.415 --> 54:49.316
You are in my very soul...

54:49.418 --> 54:51.443
tormenting me.

54:53.923 --> 54:57.415
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

55:08.371 --> 55:11.966
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

55:13.843 --> 55:15.743
I can't.

55:16.846 --> 55:19.906
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

55:20.016 --> 55:23.008
Anything is possible, Padmиж.
Listen to me.

55:23.119 --> 55:25.144
No, you listen.

55:25.788 --> 55:29.383
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

55:29.492 --> 55:33.155
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

55:35.064 --> 55:37.555
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

55:37.667 --> 55:40.135
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

55:41.404 --> 55:43.634
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

55:43.739 --> 55:45.764
Then you do feel something.

55:45.875 --> 55:48.901
I will not let you give up
your future for me.

55:49.011 --> 55:51.172
You are asking me to be rational.

55:52.315 --> 55:54.579
That is something
I know I cannot do.

55:54.684 --> 55:59.314
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

55:59.422 --> 56:01.447
but I can't.

56:02.391 --> 56:05.121
I will not give in to this.

56:12.235 --> 56:14.465
Well, you know...

56:14.570 --> 56:17.403
it wouldn't have to be that way.

56:17.506 --> 56:20.339
We could keep it a secret.

56:21.777 --> 56:23.768
We'd be living a lie...

56:23.879 --> 56:26.177
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

56:27.283 --> 56:29.581
I couldn't do that.

56:29.685 --> 56:32.552
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

56:34.523 --> 56:37.515
No. You're right.

56:39.028 --> 56:40.996
It would destroy us.

56:48.471 --> 56:52.373
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

56:52.775 --> 56:55.869
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

56:55.978 --> 56:59.141
it will take more time to grow them.

56:59.248 --> 57:01.011
I won't forget, and thank you.

57:01.117 --> 57:02.948
Thank you.

57:19.235 --> 57:21.362
R4!

57:21.470 --> 57:24.769
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

57:31.347 --> 57:34.680
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

57:34.784 --> 57:38.686
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

57:38.788 --> 57:41.256
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

57:41.357 --> 57:43.484
is the assassin we are looking for.

57:43.592 --> 57:45.560
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

57:45.661 --> 57:47.720
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

57:47.830 --> 57:50.731
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

57:50.833 --> 57:53.734
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

57:53.836 --> 57:56.805
Clear your mind must be...

57:56.939 --> 58:01.103
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

58:01.210 --> 58:03.075
Yes, Master.

58:03.179 --> 58:06.239
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...

58:06.349 --> 58:09.944
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.

58:12.822 --> 58:15.689
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

58:15.791 --> 58:19.283
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

58:19.395 --> 58:21.295
No. Whoever placed that order...

58:21.397 --> 58:23.695
did not have the authorization
of theJedi Council.

58:23.799 --> 58:27.428
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

58:28.738 --> 58:31.639
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

58:33.342 --> 58:36.903
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

58:37.012 --> 58:39.139
we could not see.

58:42.518 --> 58:44.713
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

58:44.820 --> 58:46.845
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

58:47.723 --> 58:52.057
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

58:52.194 --> 58:54.458
If informed the senate is...

58:54.563 --> 58:57.031
multiply our adversaries will.

58:58.667 --> 59:00.294
No.

59:03.739 --> 59:05.707
Mom, no.

59:34.303 --> 59:36.533
Don't go.

59:38.574 --> 59:40.542
I don't want to disturb you.

59:41.877 --> 59:43.845
Your presence is soothing.

59:46.749 --> 59:48.842
You had another nightmare last night.

59:50.052 --> 59:52.418
Jedi don't have nightmares.

59:52.955 --> 59:54.946
I heard you.

59:59.895 --> 01:00:01.886
I saw my mother.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.959
She is suffering, Padmиж.

01:00:09.438 --> 01:00:12.635
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.478
She is in pain.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:30.991
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

01:00:31.093 --> 01:00:33.084
but I have to go.

01:00:36.031 --> 01:00:38.056
I have to help her.

01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:41.668
I'll go with you.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:44.068
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.015
Dad, look!

01:00:57.653 --> 01:01:00.087
Boba, get on board!

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:18.060
Oh, not good.

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.096
Wait right there.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.189
Okey-okey.

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:35.230
Chut-chut, Watto.

01:04:37.339 --> 01:04:39.500
Let me help you with that.

01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:43.976
What? What do you want?

01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:46.547
Wait! You're a Jedi!

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:49.845
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

01:04:55.557 --> 01:04:57.718
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.156
Ani?

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.829
Little Ani?

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:10.739
Nahhh.

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:15.237
You are Ani! It is you!

01:05:16.645 --> 01:05:19.910
You sure sprouted, huh?

01:05:20.749 --> 01:05:23.274
AJedi! Whattaya know!

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:30.457
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:32.026
My mother.

01:05:32.127 --> 01:05:34.618
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:39.329
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

01:05:39.434 --> 01:05:41.732
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:44.931
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

01:05:46.074 --> 01:05:49.840
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:51.970
At least I think it was Lars.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.572
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

01:05:55.684 --> 01:05:57.982
Can ya beat that, eh?

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.548
Do you know where they are now?

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:05.559
Long way from here.

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:10.155
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

01:06:10.265 --> 01:06:12.256
I'd like to know.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.666
Sure. Absolutely!

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.798
Let's go look at my records, huh?

01:06:48.193 --> 01:06:51.253
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

01:06:51.363 --> 01:06:54.799
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.198
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

01:06:57.303 --> 01:07:00.136
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:13.118
Seismic charges!

01:07:13.218 --> 01:07:14.549
Stand by.

01:07:39.878 --> 01:07:42.540
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:02.398
Watch out!

01:08:22.154 --> 01:08:24.884
Get him, Dad! Fire!

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:29.352
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

01:08:49.415 --> 01:08:50.904
We got him!

01:08:51.015 --> 01:08:53.041
We'll just have to finish him.

01:09:18.477 --> 01:09:22.004
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

01:09:26.018 --> 01:09:27.917
Fire them now!

01:09:40.966 --> 01:09:43.435
We won't be seeing him again.

01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:19.961
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

01:10:40.593 --> 01:10:44.495
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

01:11:20.633 --> 01:11:22.567
Stay with the ship, R2.

01:11:37.183 --> 01:11:41.085
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C...

01:11:41.187 --> 01:11:43.087
3PO?

01:11:44.957 --> 01:11:46.822
The maker!

01:11:46.926 --> 01:11:48.553
Master Ani!

01:11:48.661 --> 01:11:51.459
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

01:11:51.597 --> 01:11:53.326
And Miss Padmиж. Oh, my.

01:11:53.432 --> 01:11:55.024
Hello, 3PO.

01:11:55.134 --> 01:11:59.036
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

01:11:59.138 --> 01:12:01.106
I've come to see my mother.

01:12:02.942 --> 01:12:04.967
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

01:12:07.947 --> 01:12:12.441
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

01:12:12.551 --> 01:12:14.849
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

01:12:16.122 --> 01:12:17.749
Owen Lars.

01:12:17.857 --> 01:12:20.052
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

01:12:20.159 --> 01:12:22.150
I'm Padmиж.

01:12:22.528 --> 01:12:24.928
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:27.931
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

01:12:28.701 --> 01:12:30.430
Is my mother here?

01:12:30.536 --> 01:12:32.265
No, she's not.

01:12:33.472 --> 01:12:35.201
Cliegg Lars.

01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:37.298
Shmi is my wife.

01:12:38.411 --> 01:12:41.437
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

01:12:49.054 --> 01:12:52.148
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

01:12:52.258 --> 01:12:55.159
A hunting party ofTusken Raiders.

01:12:56.162 --> 01:12:59.063
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

01:12:59.165 --> 01:13:02.532
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

01:13:03.235 --> 01:13:06.796
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

01:13:06.906 --> 01:13:08.806
when they took her.

01:13:10.409 --> 01:13:12.468
Those Tuskens walk like men...

01:13:12.578 --> 01:13:17.174
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

01:13:19.018 --> 01:13:22.044
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

01:13:23.022 --> 01:13:27.152
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

01:13:27.259 --> 01:13:32.891
I just couldn't ride anymore
until I heal.

01:13:33.766 --> 01:13:35.734
I don't want to give up on her...

01:13:35.835 --> 01:13:38.702
but she's been gone a month.

01:13:38.804 --> 01:13:41.830
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

01:13:46.612 --> 01:13:48.580
Where are you going?

01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:51.106
To find my mother.

01:13:52.318 --> 01:13:55.185
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

01:14:17.343 --> 01:14:20.335
You're gonna have to stay here.

01:14:20.446 --> 01:14:23.108
These are good people, Padmиж.
You'll be safe.

01:14:35.761 --> 01:14:37.729
I won't be long.

01:16:26.705 --> 01:16:28.696
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

01:16:28.807 --> 01:16:31.207
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:34.108
What about the senator
from Naboo?

01:16:34.747 --> 01:16:36.772
Is she dead yet?

01:16:37.483 --> 01:16:41.442
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

01:16:41.553 --> 01:16:43.851
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

01:16:43.956 --> 01:16:47.016
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

01:16:47.126 --> 01:16:50.289
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.140
As I explained to you earlier...

01:17:03.242 --> 01:17:06.473
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

01:17:06.578 --> 01:17:09.376
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

01:17:10.315 --> 01:17:13.250
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

01:17:14.186 --> 01:17:15.915
The Techno Union army...

01:17:19.158 --> 01:17:21.922
is at your disposal, Count.

01:17:22.795 --> 01:17:26.322
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

01:17:26.432 --> 01:17:28.297
Good. Very good.

01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:32.836
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

01:17:33.205 --> 01:17:35.833
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

01:17:35.941 --> 01:17:38.967
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

01:17:39.812 --> 01:17:42.508
TheJedi will be overwhelmed.

01:17:43.582 --> 01:17:47.416
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

01:18:48.247 --> 01:18:50.238
Mom?

01:18:52.684 --> 01:18:54.652
Ani?

01:18:55.888 --> 01:18:57.685
Ani?

01:18:58.924 --> 01:19:00.585
Is it you?

01:19:00.692 --> 01:19:04.253
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

01:19:10.636 --> 01:19:13.605
You look so handsome.

01:19:17.042 --> 01:19:19.135
My son.

01:19:19.244 --> 01:19:22.008
My grown-up son.

01:19:23.549 --> 01:19:25.813
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

01:19:25.918 --> 01:19:27.852
I missed you.

01:19:30.589 --> 01:19:32.682
Now I am complete.

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.722
I love y...

01:19:42.935 --> 01:19:46.063
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

01:19:46.171 --> 01:19:48.230
I love...

01:19:49.775 --> 01:19:52.243
I love...

01:20:49.334 --> 01:20:51.359
Anakin!

01:20:51.904 --> 01:20:53.371
No!

01:21:13.759 --> 01:21:15.386
What is it?

01:21:16.495 --> 01:21:19.953
Pain, suffering...

01:21:20.532 --> 01:21:22.523
death I feel.

01:21:27.072 --> 01:21:30.200
Something terrible has happened.

01:21:32.878 --> 01:21:35.904
Young Skywalker is in pain...

01:21:36.014 --> 01:21:37.879
terrible pain.

01:21:42.688 --> 01:21:46.317
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

01:21:46.425 --> 01:21:49.155
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

01:21:50.729 --> 01:21:52.720
We'll have to try something else.

01:21:55.634 --> 01:21:58.432
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:00.431
It's much closer.

01:22:02.274 --> 01:22:04.572
Anakin, do you copy?

01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:07.679
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

01:22:07.779 --> 01:22:10.111
He's not on Naboo, R4.

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:13.845
I'm going to try and widen the range.

01:22:17.255 --> 01:22:19.223
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

01:22:26.732 --> 01:22:28.597
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

01:22:28.734 --> 01:22:31.202
but it's coming from Tatooine.

01:22:32.771 --> 01:22:35.365
What in the blazes is he doing there?

01:22:35.474 --> 01:22:37.442
I told him to stay on Naboo.

01:22:40.946 --> 01:22:42.641
We haven't got much time.

01:22:42.748 --> 01:22:44.807
Anakin, do you copy?

01:22:44.916 --> 01:22:46.941
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.794
Retransmit this message...

01:22:58.864 --> 01:23:01.526
Anakin, do you copy?

01:23:01.633 --> 01:23:03.999
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

01:23:04.102 --> 01:23:06.434
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:52.973
I brought you something.

01:23:53.085 --> 01:23:55.212
Are you hungry?

01:23:56.988 --> 01:23:58.956
The shifter broke.

01:24:00.826 --> 01:24:03.624
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

01:24:06.064 --> 01:24:09.556
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

01:24:11.903 --> 01:24:13.871
But I couldn't...

01:24:17.876 --> 01:24:19.810
Why'd she have to die?

01:24:23.281 --> 01:24:25.374
Why couldn't I save her?

01:24:25.517 --> 01:24:27.542
I know I could have!

01:24:30.388 --> 01:24:32.913
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

01:24:34.593 --> 01:24:37.255
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:42.022
Someday I will be.

01:24:42.367 --> 01:24:44.995
I will be the most powerfulJedi ever.

01:24:46.705 --> 01:24:48.730
I promise you.

01:24:49.474 --> 01:24:51.840
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

01:24:55.614 --> 01:24:59.607
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

01:24:59.718 --> 01:25:01.743
He's holding me back!

01:25:06.124 --> 01:25:08.183
What's wrong, Ani?

01:25:18.937 --> 01:25:20.905
I killed them.

01:25:22.641 --> 01:25:24.609
I killed them all.

01:25:26.444 --> 01:25:28.344
They're dead.

01:25:28.446 --> 01:25:30.539
Every single one of them.

01:25:32.684 --> 01:25:34.652
And not just the men...

01:25:36.588 --> 01:25:38.647
but the women...

01:25:38.757 --> 01:25:40.657
and the children too.

01:25:41.626 --> 01:25:43.685
They're like animals...

01:25:43.795 --> 01:25:46.127
and I slaughtered them like animals!

01:25:47.766 --> 01:25:49.757
I hate them!

01:26:07.619 --> 01:26:09.587
To be angry is to be human.

01:26:09.688 --> 01:26:11.588
I'm a Jedi.

01:26:12.691 --> 01:26:14.591
I know I'm better than this.

01:26:28.573 --> 01:26:33.101
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

01:26:33.211 --> 01:26:38.342
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

01:26:41.319 --> 01:26:43.344
Good-bye, my darling wife.

01:26:47.359 --> 01:26:49.293
And thank you.

01:27:16.588 --> 01:27:18.852
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

01:27:21.359 --> 01:27:23.224
I wasn't strong enough.

01:27:27.799 --> 01:27:31.166
But I promise I won't fail again.

01:27:42.113 --> 01:27:44.172
I miss you...

01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:47.450
so much.

01:27:54.392 --> 01:27:57.088
R2? What are you doing here?

01:27:59.998 --> 01:28:04.230
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

01:28:05.236 --> 01:28:08.364
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

01:28:10.508 --> 01:28:12.976
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

01:28:13.078 --> 01:28:15.308
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.

01:28:19.818 --> 01:28:22.048
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...

01:28:22.153 --> 01:28:24.314
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

01:28:24.422 --> 01:28:28.051
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...

01:28:28.159 --> 01:28:30.150
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:33.753
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

01:28:33.865 --> 01:28:36.026
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

01:28:36.134 --> 01:28:39.797
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming...

01:28:39.938 --> 01:28:41.963
Wait.

01:28:52.817 --> 01:28:57.447
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

01:28:57.555 --> 01:28:59.318
I agree.

01:29:00.725 --> 01:29:03.023
We will deal with Count Dooku.

01:29:03.128 --> 01:29:06.689
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

01:29:06.798 --> 01:29:09.528
Protect the senator at all costs.

01:29:09.634 --> 01:29:12.159
That is your first priority.

01:29:13.605 --> 01:29:15.573
Understood, Master.

01:29:15.673 --> 01:29:17.607
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:20.940
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

01:29:23.148 --> 01:29:25.241
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:27.318
If he's still alive.

01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.882
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:34.481
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

01:29:35.693 --> 01:29:39.390
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

01:29:39.497 --> 01:29:42.728
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

01:29:42.834 --> 01:29:45.029
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

01:29:46.404 --> 01:29:49.965
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

01:29:54.012 --> 01:29:57.175
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

01:30:07.459 --> 01:30:10.428
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

01:30:10.528 --> 01:30:12.496
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

01:30:12.597 --> 01:30:15.998
The debate is over.

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.092
Now we need that clone army.

01:30:19.204 --> 01:30:22.139
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.674
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

01:30:24.776 --> 01:30:26.539
before the separatists attack.

01:30:26.644 --> 01:30:28.544
This is a crisis.

01:30:28.646 --> 01:30:31.774
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

01:30:31.883 --> 01:30:34.943
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

01:30:35.286 --> 01:30:37.481
But what senator would have
the courage...

01:30:37.589 --> 01:30:40.149
to propose such a radical amendment?

01:30:40.258 --> 01:30:44.354
If only Senator Amidala were here.

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:07.581
Traitor.

01:31:08.086 --> 01:31:11.249
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

01:31:11.356 --> 01:31:13.415
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

01:31:13.525 --> 01:31:16.153
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

01:31:16.261 --> 01:31:18.855
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

01:31:18.963 --> 01:31:22.399
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:26.163
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

01:31:26.271 --> 01:31:30.071
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

01:31:30.174 --> 01:31:32.608
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:35.611
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

01:31:35.713 --> 01:31:37.374
Do you know him?

01:31:37.482 --> 01:31:40.280
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

01:31:40.385 --> 01:31:42.353
The Geonosians don't trust them.

01:31:42.453 --> 01:31:45.320
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

01:31:46.457 --> 01:31:50.621
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

01:31:51.296 --> 01:31:53.764
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

01:31:58.636 --> 01:32:00.661
I wish he were still alive.

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.836
I could use his help right now.

01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:08.178
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

01:32:09.981 --> 01:32:12.882
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

01:32:12.984 --> 01:32:15.544
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

01:32:15.653 --> 01:32:17.678
just as you were once his.

01:32:18.656 --> 01:32:20.851
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

01:32:20.959 --> 01:32:23.985
but he wouldn't have gone along with it
if he had learned the truth as I have.

01:32:24.095 --> 01:32:26.859
- The truth?
- The truth.

01:32:33.271 --> 01:32:36.570
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

01:32:36.674 --> 01:32:38.767
of the dark lord of the Sith?

01:32:38.876 --> 01:32:41.709
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

01:32:41.846 --> 01:32:46.078
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

01:32:47.218 --> 01:32:49.778
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

01:32:49.887 --> 01:32:54.483
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

01:32:55.593 --> 01:32:57.185
I don't believe you.

01:32:57.295 --> 01:32:59.661
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

01:32:59.764 --> 01:33:02.995
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

01:33:03.868 --> 01:33:07.702
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

01:33:07.805 --> 01:33:10.899
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

01:33:12.944 --> 01:33:15.003
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

01:33:16.214 --> 01:33:20.173
and together we will destroy the Sith!

01:33:21.919 --> 01:33:24.217
I will never join you, Dooku.

01:33:33.731 --> 01:33:36.632
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

01:33:44.277 --> 01:33:47.178
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.942
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:54.350
Senators, "dellow felagates":

01:33:54.454 --> 01:33:58.481
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

01:33:58.592 --> 01:34:02.289
mesa propose that the senate...

01:34:02.429 --> 01:34:06.024
give immediately emergency powers...

01:34:06.132 --> 01:34:08.760
to the supreme chancellor.

01:34:12.839 --> 01:34:14.966
Palpatine! Palpatine!

01:34:18.078 --> 01:34:21.309
Order! We shall have order!

01:34:23.016 --> 01:34:26.349
It is with great reluctance...

01:34:26.453 --> 01:34:28.546
that I have agreed to this calling.

01:34:29.923 --> 01:34:33.882
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

01:34:34.728 --> 01:34:36.923
The power you give me...

01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:41.558
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

01:34:46.039 --> 01:34:50.874
And as my first act
with this new authority...

01:34:50.977 --> 01:34:55.380
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

01:34:55.482 --> 01:34:59.248
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:02.485
It is done, then.

01:35:07.794 --> 01:35:11.457
I will take whatJedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

01:35:11.565 --> 01:35:15.467
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

01:35:16.503 --> 01:35:20.200
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:42.885
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:45.054
They're exhaust vents of some type.

01:35:45.932 --> 01:35:47.900
That'll do.

01:35:57.377 --> 01:36:00.312
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

01:36:00.413 --> 01:36:02.506
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

01:36:02.616 --> 01:36:04.277
As a member of the senate...

01:36:04.384 --> 01:36:07.478
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

01:36:07.854 --> 01:36:09.822
Don't worry.

01:36:09.923 --> 01:36:12.357
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

01:36:17.097 --> 01:36:20.328
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

01:36:20.433 --> 01:36:22.333
they would have asked for it.

01:36:22.435 --> 01:36:25.563
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.

01:36:51.464 --> 01:36:54.627
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

01:36:56.736 --> 01:36:59.296
I am programmed
to understand humans!

01:37:02.909 --> 01:37:04.809
"What does that mean?"

01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:07.641
That means I am in charge here!

01:37:07.747 --> 01:37:09.374
Where are you going now?

01:37:09.482 --> 01:37:12.974
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

01:37:13.353 --> 01:37:15.048
Idiot!

01:37:17.257 --> 01:37:18.986
Please wait.

01:37:19.793 --> 01:37:21.727
Do you know where you're going?

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.967
Wait.

01:38:51.751 --> 01:38:53.480
Oh, my goodness!

01:38:53.586 --> 01:38:55.144
Shut me down!

01:38:56.256 --> 01:38:58.247
Machines making machines.

01:38:58.358 --> 01:38:59.825
How perverse!

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.193
Calm down, R2!

01:39:02.295 --> 01:39:04.786
I almost fell.

01:39:04.898 --> 01:39:06.866
You'll get your chance...

01:39:08.868 --> 01:39:10.699
I'm scrap.

01:39:11.771 --> 01:39:14.171
It's a nightmare!

01:39:15.942 --> 01:39:17.910
I want to go home!

01:39:19.445 --> 01:39:21.345
What did I do to deserve this?

01:40:01.287 --> 01:40:03.482
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:05.990
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.952
Oh, no!

01:40:18.371 --> 01:40:19.998
Uh-oh.

01:40:23.643 --> 01:40:25.611
I'm so confused.

01:42:21.494 --> 01:42:23.359
Not again!

01:42:23.663 --> 01:42:25.631
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

01:42:34.774 --> 01:42:36.207
Don't move, Jedi!

01:42:36.309 --> 01:42:37.799
Take him away.

01:42:56.829 --> 01:42:58.660
Don't be afraid.

01:43:00.433 --> 01:43:02.424
I'm not afraid to die.

01:43:07.273 --> 01:43:11.403
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

01:43:12.678 --> 01:43:15.238
What are you talking about?

01:43:16.716 --> 01:43:18.775
I love you.

01:43:22.555 --> 01:43:24.523
You love me?

01:43:28.995 --> 01:43:32.260
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.992
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:40.862
and that it would destroy our lives.

01:43:41.541 --> 01:43:44.032
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

01:43:49.182 --> 01:43:51.013
I truly...

01:43:52.018 --> 01:43:54.452
deeply love you...

01:43:55.655 --> 01:43:58.215
and before we die,
I want you to know.

01:44:55.381 --> 01:44:58.009
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

01:44:58.117 --> 01:45:01.177
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

01:45:03.556 --> 01:45:05.421
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

01:45:06.392 --> 01:45:07.916
Good job.

01:45:20.273 --> 01:45:23.299
Settle down. Settle down.

01:45:27.313 --> 01:45:31.044
Let the executions begin.

01:46:03.883 --> 01:46:06.818
I've got a bad feeling about this.

01:46:32.412 --> 01:46:34.880
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmиж?

01:46:34.981 --> 01:46:37.108
She seems to be on top of things.

01:47:40.113 --> 01:47:41.842
She can't do that!

01:47:41.948 --> 01:47:43.848
Shoot her... or something!

01:49:02.695 --> 01:49:04.094
Jump!

01:49:28.221 --> 01:49:31.282
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

01:49:31.291 --> 01:49:33.518
Jango! Finish her off!

01:49:33.626 --> 01:49:36.857
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

01:50:07.693 --> 01:50:09.160
Master Windu.

01:50:09.262 --> 01:50:11.594
How pleasant of you to join us.

01:50:11.697 --> 01:50:13.722
This party's over.

01:50:27.313 --> 01:50:29.577
Brave...

01:50:29.682 --> 01:50:32.048
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

01:50:32.151 --> 01:50:34.016
You're impossibly outnumbered.

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:36.452
I don't think so.

01:50:36.556 --> 01:50:37.989
We'll see.

01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:19.323
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

01:51:59.071 --> 01:52:01.539
What's all this noise?
A battle!

01:52:01.641 --> 01:52:03.836
There's been some terrible mistake!

01:52:03.943 --> 01:52:06.673
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:36.065
Die, Jedi dogs!

01:53:36.168 --> 01:53:37.931
Oh! What did I say?

01:53:47.012 --> 01:53:50.311
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

01:53:55.988 --> 01:53:58.889
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

01:54:12.838 --> 01:54:16.865
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

01:54:22.014 --> 01:54:23.982
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

01:54:42.134 --> 01:54:44.398
R2, what are you doing here?

01:54:47.606 --> 01:54:48.937
What are you doing?

01:54:49.074 --> 01:54:51.702
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

01:54:51.811 --> 01:54:53.574
My neck!

01:54:55.881 --> 01:54:58.907
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

01:55:03.923 --> 01:55:05.948
I'm quite beside myself.

01:55:14.667 --> 01:55:17.898
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

01:55:19.338 --> 01:55:21.863
Yes, but is my head on straight?

01:55:44.630 --> 01:55:46.257
Master Windu...

01:55:46.365 --> 01:55:48.595
you have fought gallantly...

01:55:49.768 --> 01:55:53.795
worthy of recognition
in the archives of theJedi order.

01:55:55.774 --> 01:55:57.071
Now...

01:55:58.043 --> 01:56:00.443
it is finished.

01:56:00.546 --> 01:56:02.537
Surrender...

01:56:02.648 --> 01:56:05.344
and your lives will be spared.

01:56:06.218 --> 01:56:09.346
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

01:56:09.455 --> 01:56:10.479
Then...

01:56:11.957 --> 01:56:14.016
I'm sorry, old friend.

01:56:24.703 --> 01:56:26.136
Look!

01:56:38.150 --> 01:56:42.109
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

01:57:38.644 --> 01:57:41.670
I've had the most peculiar dream!

01:57:52.291 --> 01:57:54.282
If Dooku escapes...

01:57:54.393 --> 01:57:58.090
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

01:58:02.634 --> 01:58:04.465
Hold on!

01:58:09.008 --> 01:58:10.976
Aim right above the fuel cells!

01:58:17.316 --> 01:58:19.580
Good call, my young Padawan.

01:58:33.832 --> 01:58:36.164
TheJedi have amassed a huge army.

01:58:36.268 --> 01:58:38.327
That doesn't seem possible.

01:58:38.437 --> 01:58:41.133
How could theJedi
come up with an army so quickly?

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:44.676
We must send
all available droids into battle.

01:58:44.777 --> 01:58:46.677
There are too many.

01:58:47.646 --> 01:58:50.410
Our communications have been jammed.

01:58:58.624 --> 01:59:01.525
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

01:59:01.627 --> 01:59:02.958
Yes, sir.

01:59:11.036 --> 01:59:12.298
Sir...

01:59:12.404 --> 01:59:15.032
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

01:59:16.041 --> 01:59:19.340
To the forward command center
take me.

01:59:42.668 --> 01:59:45.398
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

01:59:56.381 --> 02:00:00.181
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

02:00:00.285 --> 02:00:02.150
Very good.

02:00:02.788 --> 02:00:04.415
Very good.

02:00:32.618 --> 02:00:34.711
This is not looking good at all!

02:00:35.988 --> 02:00:39.253
We must get the starships
back into space.

02:00:42.294 --> 02:00:46.230
We have to order a retreat.

02:00:46.331 --> 02:00:48.697
My master will never allow
the Republic...

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.132
to get away with this treachery.

02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:54.501
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

02:00:54.606 --> 02:00:58.633
TheJedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

02:01:01.079 --> 02:01:06.381
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

02:01:09.621 --> 02:01:12.055
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

02:01:12.991 --> 02:01:15.721
They will be much safer there
with my master.

02:02:10.249 --> 02:02:15.050
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

02:02:15.153 --> 02:02:16.984
Yes, sir.

02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:20.547
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

02:03:00.699 --> 02:03:02.166
Look over there!

02:03:05.637 --> 02:03:08.037
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:10.040
We're out of rockets, sir.

02:03:10.142 --> 02:03:13.009
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

02:03:13.111 --> 02:03:17.172
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

02:03:40.639 --> 02:03:43.233
Put the ship down!

02:03:43.342 --> 02:03:45.242
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

02:03:45.344 --> 02:03:47.107
Follow that speeder!

02:03:53.185 --> 02:03:55.551
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

02:03:55.654 --> 02:03:59.146
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

02:03:59.257 --> 02:04:02.249
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

02:04:02.361 --> 02:04:04.659
You will be expelled
from theJedi order!

02:04:04.763 --> 02:04:07.994
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:10.728
What do you think Padmиж would do
were she in your position?

02:04:15.374 --> 02:04:17.399
She would do her duty.

02:04:26.385 --> 02:04:28.444
The droid army is in full retreat.

02:04:28.553 --> 02:04:31.647
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

02:04:58.650 --> 02:05:01.778
You're gonna pay for all theJedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

02:05:01.887 --> 02:05:03.582
We'll take him together.

02:05:03.688 --> 02:05:05.656
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

02:05:13.832 --> 02:05:17.324
As you see, myJedi powers
are far beyond yours.

02:05:17.436 --> 02:05:19.370
Now... back down.

02:05:25.210 --> 02:05:27.041
I don't think so.

02:05:39.357 --> 02:05:42.588
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

02:05:42.694 --> 02:05:45.754
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

02:05:48.133 --> 02:05:50.567
Surely you can do better.

02:06:01.746 --> 02:06:03.646
Are you all right?

02:06:03.748 --> 02:06:05.409
Uh-huh.

02:06:06.051 --> 02:06:08.315
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.

02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:10.012
No.

02:06:10.121 --> 02:06:13.648
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

02:06:13.758 --> 02:06:15.726
Get a transport. Hurry!

02:06:15.827 --> 02:06:16.885
Right away.

02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:43.885
Brave of you, boy.

02:06:45.156 --> 02:06:47.386
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

02:06:47.492 --> 02:06:49.084
I am a slow learner.

02:07:51.556 --> 02:07:53.319
Master Yoda.

02:07:53.425 --> 02:07:56.485
Count Dooku.

02:07:56.595 --> 02:07:59.962
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

02:08:31.262 --> 02:08:34.197
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

02:08:34.699 --> 02:08:37.793
The dark side I sense in you.

02:08:37.902 --> 02:08:40.700
I've become more powerful
than anyJedi.

02:08:41.806 --> 02:08:43.433
Even you.

02:08:58.823 --> 02:09:01.883
Much to learn you still have.

02:09:01.993 --> 02:09:05.190
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

02:09:05.296 --> 02:09:07.560
by our knowledge of the Force...

02:09:09.601 --> 02:09:12.195
but by our skills with a lightsaber.

02:09:53.445 --> 02:09:57.211
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

02:09:57.315 --> 02:09:59.078
This is just the beginning.

02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:34.738
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

02:12:34.839 --> 02:12:37.808
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

02:12:39.677 --> 02:12:42.009
You have done well.

02:12:42.113 --> 02:12:44.479
I have good news for you, my lord.

02:12:45.984 --> 02:12:49.010
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

02:12:49.621 --> 02:12:52.317
Everything is going as planned.

02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:06.259
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

02:13:06.804 --> 02:13:08.795
It doesn't feel right.

02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:12.109
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

02:13:13.411 --> 02:13:15.140
Lies, deceit...

02:13:15.246 --> 02:13:19.046
creating mistrust are his ways now.

02:13:19.150 --> 02:13:20.583
Nevertheless...

02:13:20.685 --> 02:13:23.711
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

02:13:23.821 --> 02:13:25.846
I agree.

02:13:26.991 --> 02:13:28.856
Where is your apprentice?

02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:32.862
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

02:13:34.666 --> 02:13:38.295
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

02:13:38.403 --> 02:13:40.462
Victory?

02:13:41.339 --> 02:13:43.739
Victory, you say?

02:13:43.841 --> 02:13:47.538
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:52.311
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

02:13:53.651 --> 02:13:57.485
Begun the Clone War has.

02:13:43.841 --> 02:13:47.538
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:52.311
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

02:13:53.651 --> 02:13:57.485
Begun the Clone War has.
