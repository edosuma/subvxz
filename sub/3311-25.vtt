AUNT MEL, RYDER'S
SICK AND I'M WORRIED.

00:12.780 --> 00:16.684

00:20.654 --> 00:23.757
YOUR AUNT IS THE KEYNOTE
SPEAKER AT THE JOBS FAIR.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.561
HER WORDS WILL SET THE TONE FOR
PUTTING TOLEDO BACK TO WORK.

00:27.595 --> 00:31.632
WITHOUT TONE, THE ENTIRE CITY COULD
JUST SLIDE RIGHT OFF A CLIFF.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.701
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.637
COULD YOU JUST GET RYDER OUT OF
THE HOUSE FOR, LIKE, TWO DAYS?

00:36.670 --> 00:40.007
HONESTLY, HONEY, I WOULD LOVE TO GET
EVERYONE OUT OF THIS HOUSE FOR TWO DAYS.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.609
BURKE, ARE YOU BUSY?

00:41.642 --> 00:43.744

04:50.924 --> 04:52.793
WOW. YOU CAN MAKE
ANYTHING LOOK GOOD.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.896
HEY, IF I WERE TO PUT YOU
UP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

04:55.929 --> 04:58.832
DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU
COULD DO A PHOTO SHOOT

04:58.866 --> 05:01.935
WITH A CERTAIN CITY COUNCILWOMAN WHO'S
FINALLY LEARNED TO SHAPE HER EYEBROWS?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.737
YOU GOT A DEAL.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.773
BESIDES, IT'S NOT GONNA BE TOUGH
MAKING YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.974
YOU'RE NO LANDFILL.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.910
AW, THAT'S THE SWEETEST THING
ANY LONGO'S EVER SAID TO ME.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.713
ALL RIGHT. ALL YOUR FURNITURE
IS RIGHT BACK WHERE IT WAS.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.815
YOU ARE DE-FENGED AND
I REMOVED ALL SHUI.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.917
I KIND OF LIKED IT
THE WAY TONY HAD IT.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.986
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.789
YEAH, I DID BEFORE, BUT NOW
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND, OKAY?

05:21.822 --> 05:26.694
CHANGE... HEY, THAT IS A
GREAT THEME FOR MY SPEECH.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.663
"CHANGE YOUR JOB, CHANGE
YOUR LIFE, CHANGE TOLEDO."

05:29.697 --> 05:31.732
( gasps ) I JUST
GAVE MYSELF CHILLS.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.767
IT'S LIKE I WAS
SUDDENLY INSPIRED.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.704
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE
ACCORDING TO FENG SHUI,

05:36.737 --> 05:38.772
YOU'RE STANDING ON THE CAREER
SUCCESS POINT OF THIS ROOM.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.808
AND ACCORDING TO YOU
FIVE MINUTES AGO,

05:40.841 --> 05:42.743
YOU WERE COMPLETELY ANTICHANGE.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.913
YEAH WELL, I CHANGED.
CHANGE! YAY.

05:45.946 --> 05:50.017
IT'S SO GREAT TO BE WITNESS TO SOMEONE'S
PERSONAL AND SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.885
THANK YOU, DEEPAK.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.890
HEY, THE COUNCILWOMAN'S
PRETTY SWEET, HUH?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.959
YEAH, SHE'S OKAY. YOU KNOW, SHE'S
A LITTLE CRAZY AND NEUROTIC,

05:58.992 --> 06:01.829
- BUT MOSTLY HARMLESS.
- SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH YOU GUYS?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.864
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH US?
WE WORK TOGETHER.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.767
I'M THE, UH, NANNY.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.736
GOD, I HATE THAT FRIGGIN' WORD.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.639
NO, I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING
GOING ON BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?

06:11.672 --> 06:13.006
NO. ARE YOU KIDDING?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.909
I'M GONNA PUT UP WITH HER WITHOUT
GETTING PAID? NOT A CHANCE.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.011
- SO IT'S COOL IF I ASK HER OUT?
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO ASK HER OUT?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.714
I'M IN TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS.
JUST WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.650
OH, TRUST ME, MEL
BURKE IS NOT ANY FUN.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.017
THAT'S NOT THE VIBE I GOT.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.920
I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE MORE
EXPERIENCE AROUND HER VIBE.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.790
TRUST ME... STAY AS FAR
AWAY FROM THAT AS YOU CAN.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.792
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
HAVE A THING FOR HER?

06:31.825 --> 06:34.795
'CAUSE I THINK... I THINK I'M SEEING
A LITTLE SOMETHING RIGHT THERE.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.797
- OW!
- THAT'S FUNNY.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.867
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S FUNNY IS THE THOUGHT
OF YOU TWO GUYS GOING OUT TOGETHER.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.869
OH, COME ON, MAN, SHE
LIKES THE PHOTOS.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.972
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S CODE FOR?
LIKING THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.775
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, TONY? I
JUST REALIZED SOMETHING, MAN.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.711
YOU ARE STANDING IN THE
BAD-IDEA CORNER OF THE ROOM.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.713
- LOOK AT THAT.
- ALL RIGHT, JOE, LOOK,

06:52.746 --> 06:54.848
IF YOU HAVE EVEN THE TINIEST
BIT OF INTEREST IN HER,

06:54.882 --> 06:56.850
JUST LET ME KNOW, OKAY? AND
I'LL STAY AWAY FROM HER.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.920
NO. SEE, IT'S JUST THAT...

07:00.988 --> 07:02.723
NO, THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.658
- YOU'RE SURE?
- YES YES, I'M SURE.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.695
OKAY? LOOK, ASK HER OUT.
SHE'S ALL YOURS.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.730
- GREAT. THANKS, BUDDY.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.032

DEAL OUT OF THIS THING, PLEASE?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.195
I CANNOT MISS THIS PARTY.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.198

AH. SHE'S AT A PHOTO
SHOOT WITH TONY.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.144
HE'S TAKING HER NEW
COUNCIL PICTURES.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.180
SHE SAID NOT TO WAIT UP.

08:33.213 --> 08:36.183
THAT'S COOL. IT'S GOOD TO SEE
THEY'RE HITTING IT OFF, HUH?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.118
GOOD FOR THEM.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.120

THAT'S REALLY GREAT, MEL. I'M
SEEING A LOT OF HONESTY.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.102
I'M SEEING A LOT OF COMPASSION.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.570
YEAH, ARE YOU SEEING
ANY DARK ROOTS?

08:56.604 --> 08:58.171
NO, YOU'RE GOOD. YOU'RE GOOD.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.140
UM, CAN WE TRY IT WITH A
LITTLE BIT OF A SPARKLE?

09:00.173 --> 09:03.176
YOU KNOW, LIKE, OOH, YOU
JUST WON YOUR ELECTION.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.113
BY HOW MUCH? WAS IT A
SQUEAKER OR A LANDSLIDE?

09:06.146 --> 09:09.082
NO, I'M JUST SAYING THAT YOU
SMILE SEEMS A LITTLE BOTTLED UP.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.285
LIKE, WHEN YOU KEEP WINE IN THE BOTTLE
FOR TOO LONG, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?

09:12.319 --> 09:16.123
I WOULDN'T KNOW. I DON'T KEEP
WINE IN THE BOTTLE TOO LONG.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.658
WELL, IT TURNS TO VINEGAR.

09:17.691 --> 09:21.161
AND YOU ARE NOT DESTINED TO BE
A SALAD DRESSING, MEL BURKE.

OH, I DON'T KNOW. I COULD
BE A SPICY ITALIAN

09:24.164 --> 09:26.099
OR A SWEET HONEY MUSTARD.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.569
YEAH, BUT ONCE UPON A TIME I
WAS AN EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.238
( laughing )

09:31.271 --> 09:34.174
- JOE.
- NO NO, I'M TONY.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.644
USUALLY THE WOMEN
CAN TELL US APART.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.079
- HEY, BUDDY.
- OH HEY, MAN.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.547
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.150
'CAUSE I DON'T SEE ENOUGH
OF YOU DURING THE DAY.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.118
OH, WELL, I REALIZED YOU
FORGOT YOUR COMPUTER AT HOME.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.187
AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T BE WITHOUT
THIS THING FOR EVEN AN HOUR.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.257
THAT'S WHEN I'M AT WORK. THIS
IS ACTUALLY A PHOTO SHOOT.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.293
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT WHEN THE PHOTO
SHOOT IS OVER... ( laughs )

09:53.326 --> 09:55.128
...VERY SOON,

09:55.162 --> 09:58.298
YOU KNOW, AND YOU WANT TO DO SOME WORK,
YOUR COMPUTER WILL BE RIGHT HERE.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.567
AND JOE IS A HERO.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.269
OKAY.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.605
UM, CAN YOU FLY OUT
HERE FOR A MOMENT?

10:05.639 --> 10:08.709
AND DON'T GET YOUR CAPE
CAUGHT ON ANYTHING.

10:10.678 --> 10:13.346
- YOU CAME HERE TO SPY ON US.
- I WAS NOT SPYING ON YOU.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.116
WELL, THIS COMPUTER
BAG IS EMPTY.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.617
APPARENTLY I'M NOT A
VERY THOROUGH HERO.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.187
ANYWAY, LOOK, SINCE I'M HERE,

10:20.220 --> 10:23.156
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU, THIS
IS NOT JUST A PHOTO SHOOT.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.092
OKAY? TONY IS, UM...

10:25.125 --> 10:27.327
WHAT? A CONVICT?
A SERIAL KILLER?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.596
OH MY GOD, IS HE MARRIED?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.264
NO NO NO, HE'S NOT MARRIED.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.100
HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.668
THAT'S WHAT YOU CAME
HERE TO WARN ME ABOUT?

10:34.702 --> 10:36.303
THAT A SINGLE GOOD-LOOKING GUY

10:36.336 --> 10:38.338
MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THINKING
ABOUT ASKING ME OUT ON A DATE?

10:38.371 --> 10:40.373
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

10:40.407 --> 10:43.677
I HOPE I CAN GET THE
VACCINE IN TIME.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.612
I'M JUST TRYING TO GIVE
YOU A HEADS UP, OKAY?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.381
HE'S A CHARMING GUY. AND,
YOU KNOW, DESPERATE,

10:48.415 --> 10:51.251
VERY GULLIBLE WOMEN
ALWAYS FALL FOR THAT.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.120
THANK YOU, JOE.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.223
NOW PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY... LEAVE.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.360
WHERE'D THAT SMILE GO?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.629
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST YOUR BROTHER
COMING DOWN HERE UNANNOUNCED.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.098
YEAH, I KNOW, I HATE IT WHEN
GUYS JUST SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.267
UNLESS IT'S ME, AND THEN
IT'S KIND OF AWESOME.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.137
WELL, IT DID WORK
OUT FOR THE BEST.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.204
YEAH.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.140
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I KNOW
WHAT'LL HELP YOU OUT.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.408
- TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES.
- OH, DO I HAVE TO?

11:15.442 --> 11:17.377
THEY MAKE MY LEGS
LOOK SO FANTASTIC.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.147
YES THEY DO. BUT I
STUDIED REFLEXOLOGY

11:20.180 --> 11:22.182
WHILE I WAS ON A PHOTO
EXPEDITION THROUGH INDIA.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.650
SO I KIND OF KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.685
OKAY, BUT YOU KNOW, I
JUST DON'T REALLY BELIEVE

11:25.719 --> 11:27.354
IN THAT CHAKRA
CRYSTAL ROCK STUFF.

11:27.387 --> 11:31.224
SO DON'T FEEL BAD IF IT DOESN'T...
OH, MY SWEET LITTLE PIGGIES.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.394
WOW.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.333
- ( laughing )
- HEY, YOU GUYS ARE BACK ALREADY?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.369
IT'S BARELY TOMORROW.

11:42.402 --> 11:46.139
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS A VERY
VERY GREAT PHOTO SHOOT.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.441
YES. I HAD A VERY
VERY GREAT MODEL.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.344
OH, I'M VERY VERY HAPPY TO SEE
YOU GUYS GETTING ALONG SO WELL.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.347
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA HEAD
DOWNSTAIRS, SEE WHAT WE GOT.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.684
SO, SIX-HOUR PHOTO SHOOT, HUH?
THAT'S AMAZING.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.387
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SOMEBODY COULD
SMILE FOR SIX STRAIGHT HOURS.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.190
I'M SURPRISED YOUR
FACE DIDN'T CRACK.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.426
ME, I CAN BARELY KEEP THIS THING
GOING FOR, LIKE, FIVE SECONDS.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.129
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE NOT
A POLITICIAN, OKAY?

12:09.162 --> 12:13.366
WE CAN SMILE INDEFINITELY AND TALK
OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF OUR MOUTHS.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.370
YEAH YEAH. SO, YOU KNOW,
THIS SO-CALLED PHOTO SHOOT,

12:17.404 --> 12:20.307
THAT'S ALL YOU GUYS DID, HUH, WAS
JUST TAKE A LOT OF PICTURES?

12:20.340 --> 12:24.111
OH, WELL, HE DID
REMOVE A LENS OR TWO.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.346
YOU KNOW, WE TOOK SOME
BREAKS, WE TALKED,

12:26.379 --> 12:29.282
WE HAD SOME WINE. HE
MASSAGED MY FEET.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.418
- YOU LET HIM TOUCH YOUR FEET?
- YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

12:31.451 --> 12:34.354
THAT'S LIKE A GATEWAY MASSAGE.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.157
YEAH, GATEWAY TO HEAVEN.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.392
( laughs ) ALL RIGHT, I
DON'T NEED TO HEAR ANYMORE.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.495
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE A LITTLE JEALOUS.

12:42.529 --> 12:46.466
I MEAN, ARE YOU WORRIED THAT YOUR
BROTHER AND I, YOU KNOW, DID STUFF?

12:46.499 --> 12:48.468
WHAT? EW. NO.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.303
OKAY, 'CAUSE JUST F.Y.I.,

12:50.337 --> 12:53.340
I'M NOT THE KIND OF GIRL WHO GOES
ALL THE WAY ON A FIRST PHOTO SHOOT

12:53.373 --> 12:55.242
WITH SOME PHOTOGRAPHER
I JUST MET,

12:55.275 --> 12:58.478
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE JANITOR WALKS IN.
DAMN THAT GUY.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.181
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
WHEN I SAY, "EW. NO,"

13:01.214 --> 13:02.482
YOU HEAR, "TELL ME EVERYTHING.

13:02.515 --> 13:05.318
DON'T LEAVE OUT A
SINGLE GROSS DETAIL"?

13:05.352 --> 13:08.121
MM-HMM YEAH. BELIEVE ME, I
DIDN'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.290
I MEAN I LEFT OUT
PLENTY OF THINGS.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.225
- LIKE FOR INSTANCE...
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT...

13:12.259 --> 13:14.461
UNTIL I GET OUT OF HERE.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.436
- MORNING.
- MORNING.

13:23.470 --> 13:28.408
I'M SO EXCITED. TODAY'S THE DAY
WE FINISH MEL'S JOBS-FAIR SPEECH.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.478
GIVE ME A BREAK. I DON'T HAVE A LOT
GOING ON IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.147
WELL, SHE'LL BE BACK
HERE IN A MINUTE.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.283
HER AND TONY ARE
OUT TO BREAKFAST.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.151
OH MY GOD, BREAKFAST?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.486
THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.354
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS MEANS?

13:41.388 --> 13:44.191
YEAH, MEL IS PAYING
FOR BREAKFAST.

13:44.224 --> 13:48.195
NO, THAT I MISSED MY
CHANCE WITH ANOTHER LONGO.

13:48.228 --> 13:52.165
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU GIRLS? WHAT
DO YOU GUYS SEE IN THIS MAN?

13:52.199 --> 13:54.334
WELL, HE'S A LOT LIKE YOU,

13:54.367 --> 13:57.404
ONLY LESS CLENCHED.

13:57.437 --> 14:01.341
I'M CLENCHED?

14:03.243 --> 14:06.246
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IT'S NOT
SURPRISING THAT MEL FELL FOR TONY.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.515
I MEAN, ASIDE FROM THE
CLENCHING, HE'S YOU.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.251
HE'S LIKE THE YOU
THAT SHE CAN HAVE.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.521
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT SHE'S
GOING OUT WITH ME THROUGH HIM?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.323
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO

14:16.356 --> 14:21.261
IF I WERE A LEGGY,
ALMOST-FAMOUS 5'-TALL BLONDE.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.431
NAH.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.433
I THINK SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO PISS ME OFF.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.535
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO
FIND OUT FOR SURE...

14:28.568 --> 14:32.372
GO OUT WITH ME AND MAKE
MEL WILDLY JEALOUS.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.242
THANK YOU, BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT THAT WOULD WORK.

14:35.275 --> 14:38.345
NO WORRIES. JUST TRYING
TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.184
HEY, BUDDY, LOOK WHAT I GOT.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.253
IT'S YOUR BUS TICKET. PRINTED
IT OUT ONLINE FOR YOU.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.422
OH GREAT. WOW,
THIS IS FOR TODAY.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.524
YEAH, YOU SAID YOU
WERE LEAVING TODAY.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.161
WELL YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN WHEN I SAY "TODAY."

14:54.194 --> 14:56.296
I DON'T MEAN TODAY
TODAY; I MEAN WHENEVER.

14:56.329 --> 15:00.300
I'M SORRY. THE BUS COMPANY RAN
OUT OF TICKETS FOR "WHENEVER."

15:00.333 --> 15:03.170
YOU JUST MAKE LIFE UP
AS YOU GO ALONG, HUH?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.538
UH-HUH. THAT'S THE UPSIDE
OF BEING YOUR OWN BOSS.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.275
UNLESS, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE
GETTING SICK OF ME?

15:08.308 --> 15:10.510
NO, STAY. YEAH, I
LIKE HAVING YOU HERE.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.146
MAYBE I COULD MOVE THINGS
AROUND, STAY A LITTLE LONGER.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.514
MOVE THINGS AROUND?

15:14.547 --> 15:19.219
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO MOVE
AROUND IS WHAT'S IN YOUR BACKPACK.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.154
SO, YEAH, YOU KNOW, LET'S
SEE WHERE IT GOES.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.157
YEAH, IT'S COOL. YOU'RE FREE
AND EASY; I'M FREE AND EASY.

15:24.191 --> 15:27.260
ACTUALLY, YOU CAN'T BE
FREE AND EASY JUST YET.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.296
YOU HAVE TO FINISH YOUR
SPEECH FOR THE JOBS FAIR.

15:29.329 --> 15:33.233
OH, SHOOT. YOU KNOW WHAT? PENCIL ME IN FOR
"FREE AND EASY" THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.203
- LET'S GO GO GO.
- AH.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.172
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE STAYING HER ANOTHER
WEEK, IT'S NOT GONNA BE IN MY ROOM.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.374
WELL, MAYBE I COULD FIND ANOTHER
ROOM WHERE I'M WELCOME.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.510
NO NO NO, THAT'S COOL.
YOU CAN STAY WITH ME

15:43.543 --> 15:47.247
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY
BROTHER AND I LOVE YOU.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.250
YEAH, THE FLYING
LONGOS ARE BACK, BABY!

15:50.283 --> 15:53.186
( humming circus theme )

15:53.220 --> 15:54.521
- OH OH OH...
- MAYBE LATER.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.933
AUNT MEL, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SEC?

16:06.966 --> 16:10.003
LENNOX, NOT RIGHT NOW. I'VE REALLY
GOT TO REHEARSE THIS SPEECH.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.704
OKAY, THEN I GUESS YOU
DON'T WANT TO SEE

16:11.738 --> 16:13.706
THE HALF-NAKED PICTURES OF
YOU ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.976
WHOA WHOA, WHAT? OKAY, ALL
RIGHT, BRING IT BACK OVER HERE.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.678
( gasps )

16:20.580 --> 16:24.617
WOW. SO I'M THINKING NEXT
PHOTO SHOOT, NO WINE.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.688
AND NO PHOTO SHOOT.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.959
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM A CITY
COUNCILWOMAN. I CAN'T BE SEEN LIKE THIS.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.028
DON'T WORRY, MEL. THESE
ARE CLEARLY PHOTOSHOPPED.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.731
NO ONE WOULD EVER BELIEVE
THAT'S YOUR BODY.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.600
THAT IS MY BODY.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.070
PILATES TO YOU!

16:43.103 --> 16:45.738
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING HERE

16:45.772 --> 16:48.508
WHEN YOU CLIMBED UP ON
THAT DESK AND DID...

16:48.541 --> 16:50.510
WHAT EXACTLY ARE
YOU DOING THERE?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.579
AND WHOSE SHIRT IS THAT?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.981
TONY'S. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.983
HE SAID NO ONE WOULD
SEE THESE EXCEPT US.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.651
- HE PROMISED YOU THAT?
- YES, HE DID.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.987
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW I'M
GONNA GO BREAK HIS CAMERA

17:01.020 --> 17:03.056
AND HIS PRETTY LITTLE
CUTE LITTLE BUTTON NOSE

17:03.090 --> 17:05.525
AND I'M GONNA SHOVE IT
UP HIS SUCCESS SPOT.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.994
- IS HE DOWN THERE?
- NO NO NO, ACTUALLY HE'S OUT IN THE GARAGE.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.730
YEAH, HE WANTED TO BORROW MY
WEIGHTS TO HOLD DOWN HIS YOGA MAT.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.765
I'M GONNA BORROW YOUR WEIGHTS
TO HOLD DOWN HIS THROAT.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.734
COME ON, STEPHANIE.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.037
JOE, YOU COULD HAVE JUST WARNED ME
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.006
- YEAH, I...
- ( door closes )

17:20.039 --> 17:21.741
I SHOULD HAVE.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.544
OH, BROTHER?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.615
HEY, LENNOX, HAS MEL
SEEN THESE PHOTOS?

17:28.648 --> 17:30.750
'CAUSE IT'S SOMETHING A
NEPHEW SHOULD NEVER SEE.

17:30.783 --> 17:34.087
YEAH. GET BACK UPSTAIRS, MR.
INFECTO.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.655
OH NO, I'M NOT SICK ANYMORE.
I FEEL GREAT.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.124
( sneezes )

17:38.725 --> 17:41.094
NO, IT WAS ALLERGIES, I SWEAR.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.096
NO, THE PARTY IS TONIGHT.
IT HAS TO BE ALLERG...

17:43.130 --> 17:44.564
( sneezes )

17:44.597 --> 17:48.635
NO NO NO NO NO. THIS
CANNOT BE HAPPENING TO ME.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.069
OOH!

17:51.804 --> 17:53.740
- TONY?
- HEY, BRO.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.808
- WHAT THE HECK WERE YOU THINKING?
- ABOUT WHAT?

17:55.842 --> 17:58.811
THOSE PHOTOS THAT YOU TOOK OF MEL
THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE...

17:58.845 --> 18:01.648
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE INTERNET. WHAT
DID YOU DO, SELL THOSE THINGS?

18:01.681 --> 18:03.716
NO NO NO, I POSTED
THEM ON MY WEBSITE.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.519
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE STOLEN THEM.
STUFF HAPPENS.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.054
NO, STUFF ALWAYS HAPPENS TO YOU.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.623
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE
CARELESS FLAKY-GUY THING

18:10.657 --> 18:12.625
IS JUST NOT THAT
CHARMING ANYMORE, TONY.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.761
IT MADE MEL LAUGH
A COUPLE TIMES.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.063
SHE'S NOT LAUGHING RIGHT NOW. SHE'S
ACTUALLY UP THERE PRETTY HURT.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.766
FINE FINE. LOOK, I'LL TAKE 'EM
DOWN IMMEDIATELY, ALL RIGHT?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.601
WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET ANYWAY?

18:21.634 --> 18:24.671
BECAUSE MEL...
LOOK, HER AND I...

18:24.704 --> 18:27.740
I'M JUST VERY PROTECTIVE OF
PEOPLE INSIDE THIS HOUSE, OKAY?

18:27.774 --> 18:30.710
JOE? JOE?

18:30.743 --> 18:33.813
LAST TIME I SAW THAT FACE, IT
WAS THE ANDREA DITTMAN FIGHT.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.749
YOU REALLY WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THAT AGAIN?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.117
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WRONG THEN EITHER.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.586
- YES YOU DID.
- NO I DIDN'T.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.587
- YES YOU DID.
- NO I DIDN'T.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.654
- YES YOU DID.
- NO I DIDN'T.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.590
YES YOU DID, ALL RIGHT?
YOU MADE OUT WITH ANDREA,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.525
THEN YOU TOLD THE ENTIRE
SCHOOL AND SHE WAS HUMILIATED.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.527
AND THEN WHEN I WENT TO ASK
HER OUT, SHE SAID, "NO WAY.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.828
I'M NEVER GONNA DATE
ANOTHER LONGO."

18:48.861 --> 18:51.564
- OH YEAH, I DID DO THAT.
- YOU SON OF A...

18:51.598 --> 18:53.733
SO IS BIG BROTHER GONNA
GIVE ME ANOTHER BLACK EYE?

18:53.766 --> 18:56.603
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT STARTED THAT FIGHT,
ALL RIGHT? YOU THREW THE FIRST PUNCH.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.604
- NO I DIDN'T.
- YES YOU DID.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.605
- NO I DIDN'T.
- YES YOU DID.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.739
- NO I DIDN'T.
- YES YOU DID.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.874
NO NO, THAT? I'M SORRY,
THAT'S NOT A PUNCH.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.710
- YES IT IS.
- NO NO.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.645
SEE, THAT... THAT'S A PUNCH.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.849
( grunting )

19:09.882 --> 19:11.884
BRING BACK ANY MEMORIES, BUDDY?

19:11.918 --> 19:15.622
- YEAH, TAKES ME BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE '90s.
- OH SWEET, YEAH.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.857
- I SEE YOU'VE GOTTEN A LOT BETTER AT SLOW DANCING.
- OH, YOU'RE FUNNY.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.826
JOE? TONY?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.761
- ( fighting below )
- WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

19:21.794 --> 19:22.895
YOU LIKE YOUR BOSS!

19:22.929 --> 19:26.766
HEY, SHE'S NOT MY BOSS.
I'M FREELANCE.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.803
( both grunting )

19:30.837 --> 19:33.840
HEY HEY, GUYS, STOP THIS.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.643
I TOLD YOU TO NOT
MAKE A MOVE WITH HER.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.778
STOP... STOP FIGHTING OVER ME.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.680
- YOU?
- YEAH.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.850
YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER
ME, AREN'T YOU?

19:43.883 --> 19:46.586
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:46.619 --> 19:49.589
THE TRUTH IS THAT WE'RE FIGHTING

19:49.622 --> 19:53.660
BECAUSE JOE DOESN'T HAVE
THE COURAGE TO ADMIT

19:53.693 --> 19:56.829
THAT HE STILL HOLDS A TORCH FOR
ANDREA DITTMAN AFTER 15 YEARS

19:56.863 --> 19:59.832
WHEN I'M THE ONE SHE WANTED.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.601
YEAH.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.937
YEP, THAT'S... THAT'S WHAT
WE WERE FIGHTING ABOUT.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.673
THAT'S IT.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.742
WHAT ABOUT WHAT HE DID TO ME
WITH THE PRIVATE PICTURES?

20:09.776 --> 20:12.679
OH YEAH, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.681
I DO WHAT I WANT WITH MY ART.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.617
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOUR ART.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.851
I DIDN'T SAY TACKLE HIM.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.821
OH, LONGOS... NEVER LET
THEM IN YOUR HOUSE.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.924
( both shouting )

20:32.999 --> 20:34.934
I'LL GO TO THE PARTY.
I'LL TEXT YOU.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.736
I'LL REMEMBER WHAT
EVERYBODY WORE.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.938
NOBODY WILL KISS ME. IT'LL
BE JUST LIKE YOU WERE THERE.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.875
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY. BRING
YOUR SISTER SOME CAKE.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.712
I'M JUST GONNA LIE DOWN.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.948
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
FIGHTING IN THE HOUSE?

20:48.981 --> 20:50.750
I KNOW, I KNOW.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.885
YOU KNOW, IF TONY WAS HERE, I
WOULD SMACK YOUR HEADS TOGETHER.

20:52.919 --> 20:56.689
THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A DISAGREEMENT
WITH SOMEONE, USE YOUR WORDS.

20:56.723 --> 20:57.924
OKAY.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.226
I'M JUST GLAD THIS HOUSE IS
GONNA BE DOWN TO ONE LONGO.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.994
THAT SHOULD BE THE LEGAL LIMIT.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.965
OH MY GOSH, MEL! THE
COMMENTS, THE COMMENTS.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.901
- WHAT COMMENTS?
- ALL ABOUT YOUR RACY PHOTOS ON "THE TOLEDO BLADE" WEBSITE.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.237
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M STILL
UPSET ABOUT THOSE PHOTOS.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.939
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.741
WOMEN EVERYWHERE LOVE YOU.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.743
I KNEW THEY DID.
TELL ME HOW MUCH.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.780
THIS MUCH! ONLY EVEN MORE
BECAUSE MY WINGSPAN IS PETITE.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.716
LOOK... THEY SAY YOU'RE
"LIBERATED, INDEPENDENT"...

21:23.750 --> 21:26.252
"STRONG, SEXY, EMPOWERED."

21:26.285 --> 21:27.854
YOU'RE LIKE BEYONCE.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.756
I AM.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.759
THIS WHOLE TONY THING ENDED
UP BEING A GOOD DEAL FOR YOU.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.761
I'M TELLING YOU, MY BROTHER IS
ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD GUY.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.928
AND HE'S FUN TO BE AROUND.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.864
ARE YOU CRAZY? AFTER
WHAT HE DID TO ME?

21:37.897 --> 21:39.832
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU TOOK YOUR CLOTHES OFF

21:39.866 --> 21:41.768
IN A ROOM WITH A MAN AND A CAMERA.
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

21:41.801 --> 21:43.269
NOT THAT THEY WOULD END
UP ON "THE BLADE."

21:43.302 --> 21:46.706
- EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.
- YOUR APPROVAL RATINGS WENT THROUGH THE ROOF.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.775
YEAH, BUT I STILL
THINK HE'S A JERK.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.276
WELL, HE'S MOVING IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.945
AND I INVITED HIM BACK
FOR THANKSGIVING.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.981
( theme music playing )
