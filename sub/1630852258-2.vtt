WEBVTT

00:14.265 --> 00:16.058
Each of these signals
launched a rock.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.811
There were several references
to an Azure Dragon.

00:18.811 --> 00:20.438
I think that's the name
of the spotter ship.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.772
If we could find it,

00:21.772 --> 00:23.649
it could seriously
reduce Marco's ability

00:23.649 --> 00:24.984
to keep hitting Earth.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.402
Michio, what did you do?

00:29.363 --> 00:33.075
We will find a safe port.
A place where you can stay.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.702
I don't want to leave you.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.120
You hate this job.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.496
I do. I'll step down.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.123
If I don't get
the easy way out,

00:39.123 --> 00:40.458
neither do you.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.209
Hey, late to a meeting
with the Bosmang, huh?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.419
It's a power move.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.336
Marco!

00:44.336 --> 00:45.713
Ceres will be the capital city

00:45.713 --> 00:47.381
of our Belter Nation.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.800
Marco! Marco!
Marco! Marco!

00:49.800 --> 00:51.510
Were you part
of the attacks on Earth?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.554
Me, no. But he was.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.097
- Filip!
- I'm a fucking hero.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.515
I kill the Earthers, me.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.975
Back to the ship.
- Don't fucking touch me.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.059
I'm your friend.

01:06.734 --> 01:11.405
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna get help.

01:12.865 --> 01:15.409
Hey, watch it, kid!

01:19.330 --> 01:21.290
Momma, Daddy!

01:21.290 --> 01:24.168
Cara, baby, what's wrong?

01:24.168 --> 01:26.921
Help her, please.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.589
You have to help her.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.843
Please help her.
Please. Please.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.517
Baby, I'm sorry. She's gone.

01:40.810 --> 01:43.395
No. No, no, she can't be.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.574
What happened?

01:55.574 --> 01:59.745
I don't know,
I-I think maybe...

01:59.745 --> 02:01.705
I only gave her
some of my protein bar,

02:01.705 --> 02:03.874
a little.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.125
Okay.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.794
So the birds here

02:06.794 --> 02:09.255
aren't the same
as the ones on Earth.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.048
Everything here evolved
in its own way.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.383
That's why we have
to grow our own food

02:12.383 --> 02:15.094
instead of farming
the things that are here.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.720
They have a different
kind of chemistry

02:16.720 --> 02:19.557
which doesn't work well
with ours.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.934
You mean I poisoned her?

02:21.934 --> 02:23.936
No, no, no.
It's not your fault.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.398
She has babies,
but they're all alone

02:27.398 --> 02:28.774
on the ground,
all by themselves.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.569
We...we have to put them
back in their nest.

02:31.569 --> 02:34.238
We can't.
The soldiers called a meeting.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.324
We have to attend.
All the settlers do.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.159
I still don't see the point.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.494
It's good
they're keeping us informed.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.662
We have nothing to do

02:41.662 --> 02:42.913
with whatever they're
building in orbit.

02:42.913 --> 02:43.914
And if they wanted
to be good to us,

02:43.914 --> 02:45.416
they'd open up the comm relays

02:45.416 --> 02:47.501
or at least tell us
what's going on back home.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.961
This is home.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.510
I'll help you bury her
in the morning.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.554
It's fine.
I can do it myself.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.223
There's food in the fridge.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.725
All you have to do
is warm it up.

03:02.725 --> 03:04.268
Can I go with you?

03:04.268 --> 03:07.855
Sorry, sweetie,
this is a grown-up thing.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.608
You have to stay here.

03:29.001 --> 03:32.379
What are you doing?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.632
I messed up. I have to fix it.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.887
Can I go with you?

03:39.887 --> 03:42.473
No.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.892
Sorry, but you have
to stay here, okay?

03:44.892 --> 03:47.269
Bye.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.454
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of you.

05:14.023 --> 05:16.025
What? What is it?

05:19.028 --> 05:20.529
Go away.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.865
Leave me alone.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.074
No. Hey. You can't have that!
That's not for you!

06:39.149 --> 06:42.027
Hold two,
prepare to disengage.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.947
Copy that.

06:44.947 --> 06:48.158
Aisle is closed.
Hold two is clear.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.536
Disengaging hold two.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.789
Okay,
according to the manifest,

06:53.789 --> 06:54.915
that'll do it.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.210
Hang on.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.295
Water tanks eight and nine
are still low.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.464
I just meant
that'll do it down here.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.299
Don't worry, we're just
switching the feed.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.425
We're gonna top you off.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.388
You know, I never thought
I'd see the day

07:09.388 --> 07:10.973
I'd be delivering
Mickie munitions

07:10.973 --> 07:12.683
to a privateer in the Belt.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.226
It feels kinda nice, huh?

07:14.226 --> 07:17.062
Everyone being on the same side
for once?

07:17.062 --> 07:19.022
Yeah, I guess so.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.693
Good hunting.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.794
Everything looks
good on our end.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.672
Ready to disconnect
when you are, with our thanks.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.923
Understood, Rocinante.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.383
Please stand by.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.678
Your mission specialist
is transferring over now.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.888
Our what?

07:50.888 --> 07:52.055
Your mission specialist.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.390
We weren't expecting any...

07:53.390 --> 07:54.600
Can't speak
to that, Captain,

07:54.600 --> 07:55.809
but the orders came direct

07:55.809 --> 07:57.686
from the Secretary-General
herself.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.983
Understood.
Rocinante standing by.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.989
Peaches, go to two, please.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.202
Holden?

08:13.202 --> 08:15.954
Clarissa, we have
UN personnel coming aboard.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.206
Are they...

08:17.206 --> 08:18.582
No, they're not
here for you.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.042
But just go to your quarters

08:20.042 --> 08:22.711
and stay there until you hear
different from me, okay?

08:22.711 --> 08:24.463
Okay.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.942
Bobbie.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.318
Permission to come aboard?

08:46.318 --> 08:48.445
Of course.
Permission granted.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.072
Sorry about all the hush-hush.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.282
The old lady didn't want
any of this on comms.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.742
What's going on?

08:53.742 --> 08:56.286
Change of plans.
Time to lock and load.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.990
Let him out.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.952
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't do that.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.871
We have laws on this station.

11:02.871 --> 11:05.624
This is a Free Navy matter,

11:05.624 --> 11:07.918
and I will deal
with it accordingly.

11:09.252 --> 11:13.256
Release him
into my custody, now.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.034
When we get back on the ship,

11:41.034 --> 11:43.912
clean yourself up
and report to Ops for duty.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.580
That's it?

11:45.580 --> 11:48.208
Yoan assaulted
a superior officer,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.001
and you defended yourself.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.461
That's what happened.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.969
Would you like me
to punish you some more?

12:00.971 --> 12:05.475
I would think that
the embarrassment you've become

12:05.475 --> 12:08.687
since we've arrived on Ceres
would be punishment enough.

12:14.192 --> 12:19.072
On Pallas, Cyn and I would
go out after our shifts.

12:21.199 --> 12:26.746
Every day, drink until
the bartender kicked us out.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.375
Every night, go to bed
with someone new.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.461
But always,

12:32.461 --> 12:36.506
the next day,
we were both back on the line.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.135
We couldn't fuck up

12:40.135 --> 12:44.806
because we didn't have anyone
to bail us out.

12:50.729 --> 12:53.106
We only had each other.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.166
SIGINT swept

13:11.166 --> 13:12.375
the orbital path
you identified

13:12.375 --> 13:14.252
with every available asset

13:14.252 --> 13:16.338
and turned this up.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.673
The Azure Dragon appears to be
a standard rock hopper

13:18.673 --> 13:20.091
rigged with a shit ton
of scopes,

13:20.091 --> 13:21.843
antennae, and sensor arrays.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.221
It's on the float
and running dark.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.014
And we're gonna capture it.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.559
- We are?
- Uh-huh.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.394
Our mission was
search and destroy.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.687
Not anymore.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.065
The old lady wants the data
that could be on board.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.441
She's got a Marine Corps
for that.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.151
She believes the Roci
is the best option

13:38.151 --> 13:39.277
for this operation.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.362
And why is that?

13:40.362 --> 13:42.531
Avasarala's lost
strike teams before.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.075
And the optics
of losing another one

13:45.075 --> 13:46.618
aren't good politically.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.744
We're an independent ship.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.246
If we fuck up,
it's on us, not her.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.956
It's about morale.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.290
We've been on the ropes
for too long,

13:52.290 --> 13:53.959
and we need a win.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.794
We're not gonna fuck it up.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.837
Boarding and shooting
is a whole lot riskier

13:57.837 --> 13:59.506
than sending a torpedo
up their ass.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.299
Don't you worry
your pretty little head.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.802
That's what I'm here for.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.136
It doesn't appear to be armed,

14:05.136 --> 14:07.222
and this type of ship
wouldn't have

14:07.222 --> 14:09.099
more than a crew of four.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.976
I'll make quick work of 'em.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.310
I'm sure you will.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.854
Trust me,
these fanatics

14:14.854 --> 14:16.439
are not going
to surrender, Naomi.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.400
It's...

14:21.361 --> 14:23.154
I assume you came with a plan.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.740
We slip inside
their sensor shadow

14:25.740 --> 14:27.492
and sneak up
in a slow, quiet approach

14:27.492 --> 14:28.702
behind their drive cone

14:28.702 --> 14:30.370
to get up close and personal.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.872
We cross over,
disable their drive.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.833
I brought something
special for that.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.544
Force the airlock,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.213
Done and done.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.424
Are you getting
paid extra for this?

14:42.424 --> 14:43.717
I'm not in it for the money.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.431
Oh, this is one happy crew.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.352
And speaking of crew,

14:54.352 --> 14:55.895
ship's got
a new mechanic's apprentice.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.148
Amos.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.108
Bobbie Draper, Clarissa Mao.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.861
Hello.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.446
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.406
You're free to move about.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.616
Thank you.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.161
Amos brought her
back with him from Earth

15:11.161 --> 15:12.996
after the first rocks hit.
It's a long story.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.456
You're harboring
a convicted felon.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.875
Amos trusts her,
and I trust him,

15:16.875 --> 15:19.294
and this is our ship,
so that's the end of it.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.257
Aye, aye, Captain.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.800
I'm gonna go grab some chow.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.181
Hey.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.687
You heard of any ships
going missing at the Ring?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.105
Missing?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.398
During transits.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.319
Well, there was
some Martian intel

15:44.319 --> 15:45.612
about a number of ships

15:45.612 --> 15:47.405
that went dark while passing
through the Rings.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.949
Suspicion was that they
slipped off to join Inaros,

15:49.949 --> 15:51.826
but that couldn't be confirmed.

15:52.911 --> 15:55.080
The ships were never
really accounted for.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.082
Why?

15:58.792 --> 16:02.587
I found this buried

16:02.587 --> 16:05.840
in the last Free Navy
force assessment.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.468
That's the rogue MCRN fleet
exiting the Ring Space,

16:08.468 --> 16:10.345
and that's the Barkeith.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.638
Watch this.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.477
That is not a normal transit.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.229
And you would know.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.106
Might have something to do
with the protomolecule

16:21.106 --> 16:23.066
that was stolen
from Fred Johnson.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.237
Can you get me
a look at that intel?

16:27.237 --> 16:29.072
Yeah. I'll make it happen.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.105
The Inazami
is on our scopes.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.405
Missile racks bow and stern,
full loads.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.990
There's a war on.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.075
They are where they said
they would be.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.994
- We should arm our torpedoes.
- All three of them?

17:15.994 --> 17:17.704
They're probably deciding
whether it's worth the risk

17:17.704 --> 17:18.705
to try for the bounty on us.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.956
Of course they are.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.332
Walker was a smuggler
and thief,

17:21.332 --> 17:23.251
and if we had a better option,
I would've used it.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.846
You will be safer with him
than you will be with us.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.479
Captain, nothing in the region
vectoring toward us.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.022
We're alone.

17:44.022 --> 17:47.025
Tight-beam comms.
Tell them we're ready to dock.

17:52.864 --> 17:56.493
If they try to move past us,
kill them all.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.756
Liang Walker.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.134
Camina Drummer,
on the legendary Tynan.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.221
Do we have time for a tour?

18:16.221 --> 18:19.307
- Not now.
- Aw.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.476
This the cargo?

18:21.476 --> 18:23.436
Michio.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.484
Less than we agreed?

18:29.484 --> 18:33.196
My accounts have become
more difficult to access.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.824
You will get the rest,
on my word.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.160
We have a problem.

18:44.332 --> 18:48.002
The Free Navy has taken over
security on Ganymede.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.547
They're setting checkpoints
all over the station

18:50.547 --> 18:52.423
and the docks.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.384
Cargo won't be safe there.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.886
You're Free Navy.
You can't get her through?

18:56.886 --> 18:58.096
I'm Golden Bough.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.597
Golden Bough is Free Navy.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.391
Some more than others.

19:01.391 --> 19:05.520
Marco Inaros doesn't like me.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.231
I intimidate him. Sexually.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.028
I can take her
as part of my crew

19:14.028 --> 19:17.198
until Rhea or Iapetus maybe.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.908
What are your skills?

19:18.908 --> 19:22.328
Salvager, class-two,
and emergency med tech.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.747
You won't have much to do.
We just move freight.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.749
No part in fighting?

19:26.749 --> 19:29.544
A few Golden Bough did not like
kissing Marco's ass

19:29.544 --> 19:31.880
and broke away
from the Free Navy.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.632
He made the rest of us hind tit
because of it.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.009
If you're being hunted,

19:36.009 --> 19:37.635
I would just as soon stay here.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.512
Oh, Marco doesn't want us dead.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.515
He's just humiliating us
with shit jobs.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.101
It's not so bad.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.644
Sometimes supplies go missing

19:46.644 --> 19:49.480
and money shows up
in your pocket.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.357
What sort of freight
are you moving?

19:51.357 --> 19:52.817
A lot of food and water now.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.320
Purifiers, generators.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.989
Mostly transfer
from Ganymede and Ceres.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.742
Transfer? To where?

20:02.076 --> 20:04.078
Supply depots.

20:04.078 --> 20:07.081
Marco spun 'em up
all over the Belt.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.213
This might be a good time
for a tour after all.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.327
Something changed?

20:44.327 --> 20:46.496
Just evaluating
alternate flight paths,

20:46.496 --> 20:49.999
seeing if there's a way to get
the supplies to Medina faster.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.171
Faster than that?

20:55.171 --> 20:57.507
That's your plan.
If there's a better one...

20:57.507 --> 20:58.466
There isn't.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.264
I heard about Filip.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.103
You're new here.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.815
Think carefully about
what you say next.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.110
I think you should drop him
in a recycling tank

21:17.110 --> 21:19.028
for a few hours
to see if he can swim.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.074
Are you speaking
from experience?

21:23.074 --> 21:25.785
Uncle Uttam was
a traditionalist.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.953
I'm sure I deserved it.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.373
I was going through a phase,
so...

21:30.373 --> 21:33.960
This is more than just a phase.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.920
Filip has completely
lost his focus.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.171
No self-control.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.631
That seems to be the consensus.

21:41.843 --> 21:44.929
Scuttlebutt. Crews talk.

21:44.929 --> 21:48.266
You can't prevent that.

21:48.266 --> 21:51.394
It's certainly no secret
what Filip has had to endure.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.525
Sounds like his mother had
a lot to do with it.

21:59.110 --> 22:02.155
No, it...

22:02.155 --> 22:04.365
it was his fault

22:04.365 --> 22:07.076
for bringing her amongst us.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.538
Cost us all so much.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.884
What do you want for him?

22:22.884 --> 22:25.762
I want him to be
better than this.

22:25.762 --> 22:26.804
He's a part of me.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.556
He's your son.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.601
That's the definition.

22:31.601 --> 22:34.103
I love him.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.813
That word means
different things

22:35.813 --> 22:37.690
to different people.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.360
I'm sure my uncle loved me,
in his own way.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.238
You love Filip.

22:44.238 --> 22:48.618
But that could mean you...
you pity him

22:48.618 --> 22:51.245
or you envy him.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.083
Or miss him.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.671
I need him.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.885
I need him to be the man
he should be.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.596
Are you planning on staying
angry with him until then?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.225
I only ask
because I think you have

23:12.225 --> 23:14.310
more important things
to worry about.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.855
Like our war.

23:23.945 --> 23:28.699
You know, everyone else here
is afraid of me.

23:30.868 --> 23:34.330
So...you're welcome?

23:37.750 --> 23:41.212
It's an old ship and scarred,

23:41.212 --> 23:46.092
but still hard as a coffin nail
and twice as sharp.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.593
Like Ashford.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.679
A true pirate,

23:49.679 --> 23:52.306
in the days
when that meant something.

23:52.306 --> 23:55.518
Hard to stomach
that a pansetara like Inaros

23:55.518 --> 23:56.727
ended him.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.230
Oh, the Great Marco

23:59.230 --> 24:03.818
with his pretty eyes
and his perfect hair.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.070
He got lucky.

24:06.070 --> 24:10.074
Now everyone in the Belt
believes he's a genius.

24:10.074 --> 24:13.077
He's good at turning
people into followers.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.621
But you don't seem
to like that.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.998
Neither did I.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.541
Look where it got you.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.418
Matar Kubileya
didn't like it either.

24:20.418 --> 24:22.003
And now they are dead.

24:24.046 --> 24:26.549
When Golden Bough splintered,

24:26.549 --> 24:28.843
you stayed loyal to Marco.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.511
Why?

24:30.511 --> 24:33.973
I suppose I got
caught up in the moment.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.100
Finally striking back
at the Inners.

24:37.393 --> 24:40.021
It felt...

24:40.021 --> 24:41.522
glorious.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.774
And now?

24:43.774 --> 24:45.526
What do you want from me?

24:47.278 --> 24:49.071
You know where
his supply depots are.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.493
Are you really content
with a little skim,

24:54.493 --> 24:55.912
a little side work,

24:55.912 --> 25:00.625
when the big fat prize
sits there untouched?

25:00.625 --> 25:02.877
It would be stupid
to cross Marco now.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.378
You're crossing him
by talking to me.

25:04.378 --> 25:07.006
Maybe I'm planning
to turn you in.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.634
The Golden Bough ships
that didn't show their bellies,

25:09.634 --> 25:11.052
are you still in contact
with them?

25:11.052 --> 25:13.054
Maybe. A few.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.222
We only need the ones

25:14.222 --> 25:16.515
who are tired of licking
the floor for scraps.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.059
The ones ready
to snatch the food

25:18.059 --> 25:20.186
right off Marco's table.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.314
Like a true pirate would.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.832
Yoan had family on Vesta.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.460
Okay.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.087
They should be compensated
for all he did

25:46.087 --> 25:47.380
for the cause

25:47.380 --> 25:49.382
and would have done.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.843
Yoan assaulted you,
and you defended yourself.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.137
If he had survived,
he would've been punished

25:55.137 --> 25:56.305
and then discharged.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.266
We don't owe
his family anything.

26:00.643 --> 26:03.521
You're right. Never mind.

26:03.521 --> 26:06.774
But it's a gracious impulse.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.527
I'll have the quartermaster
arrange to give Yoan's family

26:09.527 --> 26:13.364
a month worth of fuel pellets
and some new mining nets.

26:16.033 --> 26:18.035
Thank you.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.750
My name is Filip Inaros.

26:26.002 --> 26:27.878
I was a friend of Yoan's.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.299
I mean, I, um...

26:31.299 --> 26:33.259
I served with him
in the Free Navy.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.763
I'm sorry for what happened.

26:37.763 --> 26:41.600
I-it was...
well, Yoan, he was...

26:58.284 --> 27:00.453
My name is Filip Inaros.

27:02.038 --> 27:04.040
I served with Yoan
in the Free Navy.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.627
I'm sorry for your loss.

27:09.879 --> 27:13.132
Supplies are being sent to you
as tribute for his service.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.638
He died honorably

27:19.638 --> 27:22.641
serving Marco Inaros
and the Belt.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.745
Of course I don't like it.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.747
It's high risk,
a lot of unknowns.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.207
I wish you'd talked her
out of it.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.626
"Talked her out of it."
I didn't even get the chance.

27:48.626 --> 27:50.169
She didn't consult me on this.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.004
Jesus.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.687
How do I get
one of those suits?

28:49.687 --> 28:51.647
You'd only hurt yourself,
peewee.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.695
Good to go.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.747
Madam Secretary-General,
I'm glad I caught you.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.207
This is not a good time.

29:10.207 --> 29:11.542
Well, it never is, ma'am,

29:11.542 --> 29:13.335
but I am getting
the distinct impression

29:13.335 --> 29:15.421
that something is going on,
and I would love to know...

29:15.421 --> 29:18.174
Ms. Stuart,
if you continue to abuse

29:18.174 --> 29:21.427
your access aboard this ship,
I will have it revoked.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.208
Shit! They saw us.
They're rabbiting!

29:52.208 --> 29:53.167
Everyone, brace!

30:02.468 --> 30:05.179
I'm locking 'em up.
Railgun charging.

30:05.179 --> 30:07.097
Negative. Holden, do not fire.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.724
I'm gonna try to put one
through their drive.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.351
I repeat, do not fire.

30:10.351 --> 30:11.685
We can't let them escape.

30:11.685 --> 30:13.103
We can't risk
destroying them.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.688
Our mission is to get aboard.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.440
They're running.
The mission is scrubbed.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.067
I have operational command,

30:18.067 --> 30:21.111
and the mission is scrubbed
when I say it is.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.322
Put us alongside,
hold us steady,

30:23.322 --> 30:25.783
and wait for my go signal.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.993
God damn it, Bobbie.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.161
Fuck.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.996
All right, everybody brace.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.416
Oh, fuck.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.503
What are you doing?

31:19.503 --> 31:23.507
Holden!
Get me as close as you can!

31:23.507 --> 31:24.466
They're trying
to burn us up

31:24.466 --> 31:25.301
in their drive plume.

31:25.301 --> 31:26.802
No shit!

31:26.802 --> 31:28.220
Closer.

31:29.346 --> 31:30.889
Closer.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.291
They're dead in the water.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.917
Naomi, you're good
to cross over.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.295
I'm heading over
to blow the airlock.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.505
On my way.

32:08.761 --> 32:12.181
Naomi? Where are you?

32:12.181 --> 32:13.474
I'm coming.

32:23.359 --> 32:27.029
Naomi. Hurry.

32:27.029 --> 32:30.115
They're gonna try
to start it up again.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.659
I got it.

32:31.659 --> 32:32.951
Stop.

32:36.914 --> 32:38.332
What happened to Naomi?

32:38.332 --> 32:40.459
She had
a technical malfunction.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.086
What the fuck
are you talking about?

32:42.086 --> 32:43.587
Naomi, report in.
Are you all right?

32:43.587 --> 32:44.797
What's going on?

32:44.797 --> 32:46.173
I'm fine.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.760
Hatch open.
Starting bypass.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.928
If I'm back up,

32:50.928 --> 32:52.513
they're getting close
to back up too.

32:52.513 --> 32:54.848
We won't want to be here
when this ship takes off again

32:54.848 --> 32:56.350
or blows up.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.977
I know.
It's okay. I got this.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.813
Airlock field is secure.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.690
As expected.
Go for breach.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.780
Breaching charges
going on now.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.324
Status on the reactor.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.243
Clarissa, give me an update.

33:14.243 --> 33:16.078
It's like they made
this out of old scraps.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.372
Nothing here makes sense.

33:18.372 --> 33:21.625
We're ready for breach.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.085
We going in or what?

33:23.085 --> 33:24.545
Clock's ticking, Clarissa.

33:24.545 --> 33:26.964
Can you kill
the reactor or not?

33:26.964 --> 33:28.716
Clarissa, you need to find

33:28.716 --> 33:31.385
the magnetic bottle
power feed line.

33:33.262 --> 33:35.723
It'll be the most heavily
shielded cable in there.

33:35.723 --> 33:38.142
Most likely
that black-looking one

33:38.142 --> 33:39.935
under the conduit.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.311
Pull that one out.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.648
Thank you.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.442
Charges are in place.
Ready to breach.

33:46.442 --> 33:47.651
Bobbie, you coming?

33:50.654 --> 33:52.156
Clarissa, stay behind me!

33:58.787 --> 34:01.457
-
- Shit!

34:01.457 --> 34:02.708
Bobbie,
what's going on?

34:02.708 --> 34:03.917
Do you need assistance?

34:03.917 --> 34:05.335
I've got three Belters down.

34:05.335 --> 34:06.545
Clarissa's hurt.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.300
God damn it, I have to get her
back to the Roci ASAP.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.634
You go for breach.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.052
We got this.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.732
Clear.
Clear.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.278
Drive is still offline.

34:31.278 --> 34:32.571
Bobbie.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.906
Are you inside?

34:33.906 --> 34:35.449
How's Peaches?

34:35.449 --> 34:36.700
She's fine.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.994
She really saved my ass
out there.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.705
Good. She did good.

34:41.705 --> 34:44.875
Naomi, it looks like they were
trying to wipe their data core.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.127
We'll need the Roci
to crack the encryption.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.253
Give me a hard link.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.840
What happened back there?

34:53.467 --> 34:55.093
I'm all right.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.345
Really all right,

34:56.345 --> 34:58.096
or "not ready
to talk about it" all right?

35:00.557 --> 35:02.017
Second one.

35:02.810 --> 35:03.894
Okay.

35:11.693 --> 35:14.863
All right, that's it. We're in.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.865
You should have access
to whatever's there.

35:23.872 --> 35:26.708
Holy shit.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.669
What is it?

35:34.299 --> 35:36.093
The mother lode.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.024
Come.

35:54.945 --> 35:57.281
Ms. Stuart, thank you for...

35:57.281 --> 35:59.324
So what happened?

35:59.324 --> 36:01.618
What makes you think
anything did?

36:01.618 --> 36:03.704
Well, for the past
several hours,

36:03.704 --> 36:04.997
every officer on this ship

36:04.997 --> 36:07.124
has been walking around
as if their sphincters

36:07.124 --> 36:09.334
had just been tightened
by three notches.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.587
And your comms director
just blasted out

36:11.587 --> 36:13.505
a reminder
of media's obligations

36:13.505 --> 36:15.382
under the War Security Act,

36:15.382 --> 36:18.343
which means something
really, really bad happened.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.431
Or we caught a break.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.892
I didn't bring you here
to talk about that.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.979
Oh, God damn it.

36:31.899 --> 36:34.067
You'll get
the good news in short order.

36:41.450 --> 36:44.995
I want to commission
a project from you.

36:44.995 --> 36:48.040
I want the Belt to see
what it's doing to us.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.710
The feeds are full of numbers
and political rhetoric.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.880
I want them to see
the people they've hurt.

36:54.880 --> 36:59.384
I don't do propaganda.
You have your minions for that.

36:59.384 --> 37:03.138
I do, and if I need
a public service announcement

37:03.138 --> 37:06.808
about intimate disease,
they're fine.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.144
But you have a following
and you have style.

37:09.144 --> 37:12.022
I have credibility
that state media doesn't have,

37:12.022 --> 37:14.232
and you'd like to exploit it.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.693
I'm not asking you
to lie for me.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.112
I'm asking you
to tell the truth.

37:19.112 --> 37:22.157
Not just the statistics,
but what they mean.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.576
The lives we've lost.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.079
The pain we've suffered.

37:27.079 --> 37:30.499
All the things
regular newsfeeds skip.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.918
That's not gonna change
any Belter's minds.

37:32.918 --> 37:36.463
It might.
A few on the margins.

37:36.463 --> 37:39.091
You can put a human face on us.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.886
And make it just
a little harder for them

37:42.886 --> 37:45.722
to feel good
about killing Earthers.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.185
Or don't

37:50.185 --> 37:53.563
and wonder
with every new attack

37:53.563 --> 37:57.776
if that was the one
you could have stopped

37:57.776 --> 38:00.404
and you chose not to.

38:03.865 --> 38:07.244
Wow.

38:07.244 --> 38:10.038
You give
a really good guilt trip.

38:10.038 --> 38:13.959
I practice a lot
when I'm alone.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.926
Using the mods.

38:22.926 --> 38:26.138
It's just reflex.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.973
I guess. It's embarrassing.

38:30.559 --> 38:34.271
I saw what that rocket did
to the ship's hull.

38:34.271 --> 38:35.647
And I'm pretty sure
it could have peeled

38:35.647 --> 38:37.899
Bobbie's shell open
if it hit her.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.278
You're trying to make me
feel better

38:41.278 --> 38:43.113
about almost drowning
in my own puke.

38:44.448 --> 38:46.742
You saved her life.
Take the win.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.374
You mind if we talk?

38:54.374 --> 38:55.667
Sure. Go ahead.

39:01.882 --> 39:04.593
This is partly my fault.

39:04.593 --> 39:06.386
The only real reason
I let you stay aboard

39:06.386 --> 39:08.263
was as a favor to Amos.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.140
And that's how I've been
thinking about you,

39:10.140 --> 39:11.808
as an obligation.

39:11.808 --> 39:12.809
I understand.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.603
I don't think you really do.

39:17.898 --> 39:20.192
I know you were trying to help.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.652
But we had a plan,
and when you changed that plan

39:22.652 --> 39:24.112
without going through
the chain of command,

39:24.112 --> 39:26.698
you put all of us at risk.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.783
I'm the captain of this ship,

39:27.783 --> 39:28.992
and as long as you're
part of the crew,

39:28.992 --> 39:30.786
you do what I say when I say.

39:30.786 --> 39:33.413
If you see a problem,
you talk to me first

39:33.413 --> 39:35.957
so everyone knows
what's going on.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.001
No more deciding for yourself
what the new plan is.

39:39.628 --> 39:42.255
I get it.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.924
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.427
Good.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.649
You know you just got
chewed out, right?

40:02.692 --> 40:05.987
That's the first time he said
I was part of the crew.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.373
Don't know
how the Dusters found us.

40:16.373 --> 40:18.625
They jam us, hit us
with EMP...

40:18.625 --> 40:21.044
but we got a surprise
for them too.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.170
Gonya wipe data core now.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.968
The Azure Dragon is gone.

40:29.970 --> 40:33.974
Our scopes are showing nothing
at its expected location

40:33.974 --> 40:35.851
and no indication
it was destroyed.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.313
They captured it.

40:42.816 --> 40:45.735
If they got
the data core intact,

40:45.735 --> 40:47.946
they'll be able
to locate the rocks

40:47.946 --> 40:49.239
that are still in flight

40:49.239 --> 40:51.449
and all the rest
that are ready to launch.

40:55.954 --> 40:59.082
And the moment that happens,

40:59.082 --> 41:03.503
they'll redeploy their fleets
and head out.

41:09.050 --> 41:10.927
No need to be so glum.

41:14.598 --> 41:18.810
You said the fight would come
soon enough,

41:18.810 --> 41:21.688
and here it is.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.690
The Inners were never
going to give Ceres up.

41:23.690 --> 41:27.319
They're sentimental that way.

41:27.319 --> 41:28.778
Let them come.

41:31.406 --> 41:32.824
We'll be ready.
