00:02.961 --> 00:05.045
Mom, would you relax?

00:05.338 --> 00:09.174
That was 10 blocks from here,
and the woman was walking alone at night.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.010
I would never do that.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.846
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

00:14.055 --> 00:17.391
This is a safe street.
This is a safe building. There's nothing...

00:17.600 --> 00:20.602
Aah! Oh, my God!
What are you doing in here?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.604
Mom, I gotta go. I gotta go.

00:25.900 --> 00:26.942
Oh, my God.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.944
Okay.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.196
That's fine, you just read the paper.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.824
I'm gonna get a pot.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.118
It's not for you.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.834
Okay, that's fine.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.796
Read the Family Circus...

00:48.465 --> 00:51.341
...enjoy the gentle comedy...

00:55.096 --> 00:58.015
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:00.810 --> 01:04.396
Ugh. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.693
It's open, you guys.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.197
- Hi.
- Hi. Can I help you?

01:13.364 --> 01:15.616
I'm looking for Phoebe,
does she still live here?

01:15.784 --> 01:18.160
Uh, no, she doesn't.
But I can get a message to her.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.205
Great. Uh, just tell her
her husband stopped by.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.956
Her what? Aah!

01:24.542 --> 01:26.835
Hey, how did you do that?

02:16.678 --> 02:19.972
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

02:20.181 --> 02:22.057
I'm not "married" married,
you know?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.934
He was just a friend, and he's gay...

02:24.144 --> 02:26.812
...and he was from Canada,
and he needed a Green Card.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.064
I can't believe you married Duncan.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.691
I mean, how could you not tell me?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.985
We lived together,
we told each other everything.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.822
I'm sorry, Monica, but I knew if I told you,
you'd get really, like, judgmental...

02:36.990 --> 02:38.031
...and would not approve.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.200
Of course I wouldn't approve.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.537
You were totally in love
with this guy who, hello, was gay.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.539
I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

02:45.748 --> 02:47.708
See? And you thought
she'd be judgmental.

02:49.085 --> 02:53.088
Okay, I wasn't in love with him.
I was just helping out a friend.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.675
Please. When he left town,
you stayed in your pajamas for a month.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.844
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.599
Well, didn't you?

03:04.642 --> 03:06.226
I might have.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.438
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.106
Come on.
Like you tell me everything?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.066
What have I not told you?

03:13.234 --> 03:15.194
Ooh, I don't know. Um...

03:15.361 --> 03:19.364
...how about the fact that the underwear
out there on the telephone pole is yours...

03:19.616 --> 03:22.117
...from when you were having sex
with Fun Bobby on the terrace.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.621
- What?
- Wait a minute. Who told you?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.919
You are dead meat.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.796
I didn't know it was a big secret.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.132
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.802
You know, kind of on the same lines as,
say, I don't know, having a third nipple.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.849
You have a third nipple?

03:47.810 --> 03:49.770
You bitch.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.608
- Whip it out. Whip it out.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:54.776 --> 03:59.071
No, come on. There's nothing to see.
It's just a tiny bump. It's totally useless.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.531
Oh, as opposed to your other
multifunctional nipples?

04:03.993 --> 04:07.162
I can't believe you.
You told me it was a nubbin.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.041
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

04:12.168 --> 04:15.879
I don't know. You see something, you
hear a word, I thought that's what it was.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.800
- Let me see it again.
- Yeah, show us your nubbin.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.176
Joey was in a porno movie.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.975
If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody with me.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.228
- Oh, my God.
- You were in a porno?

04:31.396 --> 04:34.690
All right, all right.
I was young and I just wanted a job, okay?

04:34.899 --> 04:36.984
But at the last minute
I couldn't go through with it.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.320
So they let me be the guy who comes in
to fix the copier but can't...

04:40.530 --> 04:43.198
...because there's people
having sex on it.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.700
Wow.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.076
That is wild.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.579
- So, what's it shaped like?
- Is there a hair on it?

04:49.872 --> 04:51.748
What happens if you flick it?

04:59.340 --> 05:02.801
So, uh, does it do anything,
you know, special?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.388
Why, yes, Ross, pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...

05:06.639 --> 05:08.849
...to the magical land of Narnia.

05:09.976 --> 05:14.521
You know, in some cultures, having
a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.524
You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

05:17.900 --> 05:22.195
Huh. Are, uh, any of these cultures,
per chance, in the Tri-State area?

05:22.905 --> 05:27.409
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

05:28.578 --> 05:32.831
Ooh, Julie's so smart. Julie's so special.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.835
Look, honey, I wanted you to hook up
with Ross as much as you did.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.464
But he's with her now.
You're just gonna have to get over it.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.467
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.262
God, see, I didn't know that's what
I had to do. I just have to get over it.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.017
Whoa.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.394
- Sassy lady.
- Where are you going?

05:54.562 --> 05:57.981
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.150
He's in the Capades.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.404
- The Ice Capades?
- No, no, the Gravel Capades.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.117
Yeah, the turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.496
I can't believe you're dressing up for him.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.123
You're setting yourself up
all over again.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.500
Okay, no.

06:18.086 --> 06:22.589
For your information, I'm going to see him
so I can put all those feelings behind me.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.676
And the reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

06:26.886 --> 06:29.346
...to look nice for your gay husband.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.475
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.811
Hey, Chandler, will you fill me up here?

06:42.860 --> 06:45.737
Oh, I see, I see.
Because of the third-nipple thing.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.248
- Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.627
- See you later, Rach.
- Bye-bye, Julie.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.511
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.140
Hey, come on, cut it out.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.059
- Hey.
- What?

07:17.186 --> 07:19.688
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.732
- Eh.
- What?

07:23.734 --> 07:26.695
- Come on, talk to me.
- Okay.

07:27.155 --> 07:31.908
What's the longest you've been
in a relationship before...

07:33.411 --> 07:36.204
...having the sex?

07:37.498 --> 07:40.000
Why? Who's not...?
Are you and Julie not...?

07:40.209 --> 07:42.210
Are you and Julie not having sex?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.463
Well...

07:44.839 --> 07:46.298
Technically?

07:46.883 --> 07:49.551
- No.
- Wow.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.137
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

07:54.515 --> 07:58.393
Or is it because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feel like school?

07:58.561 --> 08:03.356
No. No. She's great. And it's not
like we haven't done anything.

08:03.524 --> 08:08.028
I mean, we do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like...

08:08.237 --> 08:10.864
No, no, no.
Don't need to know the details.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.201
No, it's just...

08:14.744 --> 08:16.161
It's me.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.456
You know, I've only been
with one woman my whole life...

08:19.707 --> 08:21.875
...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.084
Uh-huh.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.755
So now I've got myself all psyched out.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.466
It's become, like, this...

08:30.718 --> 08:32.677
...this thing, and I...

08:34.764 --> 08:37.057
You must just think I'm weird.

08:37.265 --> 08:40.101
No. No, no, no. I don't think it's weird.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.854
I think... I think, um, in fact...

08:43.063 --> 08:45.524
- In fact, you know what I think?
- What?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.984
I think it's sexy.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.487
Sexy?

08:50.738 --> 08:52.864
Let me tell you something.
As a woman...

08:53.115 --> 08:56.159
...there is nothing sexier...

08:56.410 --> 08:59.079
...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.708
- No kidding.
- Oh, yeah. In fact, you know what I'd do?

09:03.918 --> 09:05.335
I'd wait.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.131
- You'd wait?
- Yes, absolutely. I would wait...

09:10.550 --> 09:12.425
...and wait...

09:13.427 --> 09:15.136
Then I'd wait some more.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.640
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.810
I don't care how much she tells you
she wants it, I don't care if she begs...

09:21.978 --> 09:26.815
...she pleads, she tells you
she's gonna have sex with another man.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.692
That just means it's working.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.322
Women really want this?

09:34.615 --> 09:36.324
More than jewelry.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.925
Hi.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.219
- Phoebe.
- Ta-da.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.763
Hi.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.308
Ah, look at you. You look great.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.810
Do I? Thank you.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.855
- So do you. Sparkly.
- Thanks.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.150
So...

10:10.318 --> 10:15.572
Wow. This is pretty wonderful, huh,
Mr. Major Capades Guy.

10:16.824 --> 10:21.494
I remember when you were just like
King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.789
You always said I'd make it.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.376
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm kind of spooky that way. Woo.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.212
God, I missed you.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.801
- I'm gonna get changed.
- Okay.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.764
Um, now.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.391
- What?
- Pheebs.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.685
Oh. Right. Okay.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.980
- Olé.
- What?

10:50.441 --> 10:51.983
The Matador, so...

10:56.030 --> 10:58.281
Olé. Ha, ha.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.329
- Sweetie, can you hold this for a second?
- Sure.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.955
Thanks.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.048
- Uh, Julie?
- Yeah.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.176
Sorry, you had a paleontologist
on your face.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.137
But, uh, it's gone now. You're all right.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.972
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.225
Oh, listen, listen...

11:25.976 --> 11:29.270
I wanted to thank you
for, uh, our little talk before.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.941
Oh, God, no problem.
So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?

11:33.192 --> 11:36.611
Well, I was going to,
but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.284
Good. Ahem. What did he say?

11:43.494 --> 11:46.204
Basically, he told me to get over myself
and just do it.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.916
So I thought about what you said
and about what he said.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.627
And, well, his way,
I get to have sex tonight, so...

11:59.301 --> 12:01.678
What is this in my pocket?

12:02.346 --> 12:04.556
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.309
Pop it in.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.604
I'm fine with it, I mean,
if you're okay watching a video...

12:11.772 --> 12:14.065
...filled with two-nippled people.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.280
Great. People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.741
What's wrong with people having sex?

12:23.075 --> 12:24.743
Well...

12:25.578 --> 12:30.123
Well, um, you know,
these movies are offensive...

12:30.332 --> 12:34.794
...and, uh, degrading
to women and females...

12:35.463 --> 12:39.090
And, uh, the lighting's
always unflattering.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.510
And...

12:42.678 --> 12:46.014
- Monica, help me out here.
- Hell, I wanna see Joey.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.607
So is there, like, a story,
or do they just start doing it right...

12:57.193 --> 12:59.068
Oh. Never mind.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.989
Okay, now, wait a minute. That is the
craziest typing test I've ever seen.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.076
All I say is, she better get the job.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.496
Looks to me like he's the one
getting the job.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.958
Shh. Hey, here I come. Here I come.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.960
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.964
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking,
"What do I do? What do I do?"

13:21.717 --> 13:24.093
So I just watch them have sex.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.057
And then I say... Here's my line.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.851
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.855
- Nice work, my friend.
- Thank you.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.943
Wait, you see me again.
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.989
There I am. There I am. There I am.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.250
So, um... So, what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.293
Oh, yeah, um...

13:58.671 --> 13:59.838
All right.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.383
I kind of need a divorce.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.678
Okay.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.179
How come?

14:08.764 --> 14:12.183
Um, actually, I'm getting married again.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.601
What?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.812
Oh, God,
I don't know how to tell you this.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.357
I'm straight.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.652
Yeah, I know.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.156
I don't understand. I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

14:27.366 --> 14:29.826
I mean, you're so smart and funny...

14:30.035 --> 14:32.912
...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.498
I know. That's what I kept telling myself.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.543
But you just reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.755
So how long have you known?

14:44.425 --> 14:47.886
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.930
I thought I was supposed
to be something else.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.894
You know, I'm an ice dancer, all my
friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

14:57.688 --> 15:01.858
And, um... And there's actually a woman?

15:03.027 --> 15:05.486
- Her name's Debra.
- Oh.

15:07.531 --> 15:10.450
Well, is she the first
that you've been with?

15:12.244 --> 15:13.870
Well, I've never told you this...

15:14.038 --> 15:19.584
...but there were one or two times
back in college...

15:19.752 --> 15:21.920
...when I'd get really drunk
and go to a straight bar...

15:22.129 --> 15:24.380
...and wake up with a woman next to me.

15:24.548 --> 15:29.761
But I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.347
Sure.

15:32.556 --> 15:35.767
But now I know I don't have a choice
about this. I was born this way.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.230
I don't know what to say.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.400
I mean, you know,
you're married to someone for six years...

15:44.568 --> 15:46.069
...and you think you know him.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.280
And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay."

15:54.662 --> 15:56.871
I'm... I'm still me.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.418
Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?

16:05.005 --> 16:07.632
You know,
it still smells like monkey in there.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.220
Well, that saves us the conversation.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.808
Well, this has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.268
- Me too. We should get going.
- No.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.105
No. I mean... No. Come on, you guys.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.775
Come on, look, it's only 11:30.

16:26.026 --> 16:30.154
Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.865
Rachel, that's all we do.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.245
Maybe that's all we do.
What about Julie?

16:38.539 --> 16:40.164
What about Julie?

16:40.541 --> 16:44.377
Well, you have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...

16:45.004 --> 16:46.879
...and we don't really know you.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.673
I mean, who is Julie?

16:50.134 --> 16:52.301
I mean, what do you like?
What don't you like?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.721
We want to know everything.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.973
Well, heh, that could take a while.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.725
So?

17:00.352 --> 17:03.104
I mean, who here does not have
the time to get to know Julie?

17:04.022 --> 17:06.357
- I got the time to get to know Julie.
- I got time, yeah.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.694
Uh, Rach, ahem, I know her pretty well.
Can I go?

17:13.615 --> 17:14.866
That's fine.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.744
Okay, Julie, so let's start with
your childhood. What was that like?

17:20.079 --> 17:23.165
- Well, in a nutshell...
- Ah-ah-ah.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.337
So, um, have you told your parents?

17:28.839 --> 17:31.841
No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.385
My brother's straight, so...

17:35.888 --> 17:37.305
Here you go.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.058
You know what?
I just have one more question. Um...

17:40.517 --> 17:45.438
If you had figured this out sooner,
and, um, I had been around...

17:45.731 --> 17:48.441
...do you think I would have been
the one who?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.486
No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.698
I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.

17:57.701 --> 17:58.868
I love you, Phoebe.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.511
So your brother's straight, huh?

18:18.138 --> 18:19.263
Seriously.

18:22.726 --> 18:26.104
- And my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

18:26.355 --> 18:28.981
...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.317
Ahem. Mrs. Gobb?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.402
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.780
Hmm, okay.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.450
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?

18:39.701 --> 18:41.119
I'm going home.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.626
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

18:50.754 --> 18:51.963
Good night.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.173
Whew.

18:54.341 --> 18:58.678
So it's pretty late. You're probably, uh,
not still planning on...

18:58.846 --> 19:01.347
- Oh. No, no, I am.
- Oh.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.600
Well, hey, are you nervous?

19:04.768 --> 19:06.894
No, no. I, uh...

19:07.062 --> 19:08.938
I have done it before.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.692
Well, okay, I mean,
how are you gonna handle it?

19:12.901 --> 19:17.029
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?
Are you just gonna pounce?

19:17.406 --> 19:20.533
I, uh... I don't know.
I guess I'm just gonna...

19:21.201 --> 19:23.452
...see what happens.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.581
Okay. Good luck.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.499
What...? Uh...

19:29.126 --> 19:32.920
- What?
- Nothing. I mean, um...

19:33.088 --> 19:38.593
It is your first time with her, and, you know,
if the first time doesn't go well...

19:38.760 --> 19:42.221
...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.392
Okay, now I'm nervous.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.563
Maybe you should put it off.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.482
No, I don't want to put it off.

19:56.069 --> 20:01.199
God, I'm just... I spent last year
being so unbelievably miserable.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.327
And now I'm actually happy.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.247
You know, I mean, really happy.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.625
I just don't wanna...

20:11.168 --> 20:13.920
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.256
I know.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.467
Yeah.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.844
I'm sorry.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.138
No, it's not your fault.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.598
Right.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.394
Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.

20:30.979 --> 20:36.108
Maybe you were on the right track with
that whole, you know, spontaneous thing.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.362
- I mean, women really like that.
- Really?

20:39.613 --> 20:42.031
Yeah. I mean, you know, if...

20:42.199 --> 20:45.534
I mean if it were me, I'd, you know,
want you to...

20:45.702 --> 20:47.703
- What?
- I don't know, catch me off guard.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.997
You know, with, like, a really...

20:50.707 --> 20:52.041
...good kiss.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.543
You know, really...

20:54.711 --> 20:58.756
...sort of, um, soft at first.

20:59.883 --> 21:04.804
And then maybe, um,
brush the hair away from my face.

21:05.305 --> 21:09.392
And then look far into my eyes...

21:09.643 --> 21:12.311
...in a way that lets me
know something...

21:13.563 --> 21:15.815
...amazing is about to happen.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.900
Uh-huh.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.365
And then, I don't know, then...

21:24.574 --> 21:27.493
...you'd pull me
really close to you so that...

21:27.744 --> 21:31.289
So that I'd be pressed up, you know,
right against you.

21:31.581 --> 21:35.876
And, um, it would get kind of...

21:37.629 --> 21:39.213
...sweaty...

21:40.882 --> 21:42.925
...and, uh... And blurry.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.180
And then it's just happening.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.933
Oh.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.481
Thanks, Rach. Good night.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.195
Oh, God.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.172
Good morning.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.343
Well, somebody got some last night.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.599
Twice.
