WEBVTT

03:18.280 --> 03:21.120
‐ Well...womp‐womp.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.800
‐ Hey, come on.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.400
Stop it.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.440
‐ I can't.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.160
I‐I can't.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.760
LUCY:
I just wanted it to be natural.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.240
‐ It will be natural.
Just let me call him.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.280
Look, he's one of the top five
fertility specialists

03:43.280 --> 03:45.200
in the world.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.400
‐ As a woman,
this is the one thing

03:48.400 --> 03:50.880
I'm supposed to be able to do,
and I can't do it.

03:50.880 --> 03:55.120
‐ Well, let's just find out
if we can get pregnant.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.520
And if we can't, then, you know,
we'll blow the college fund

03:58.520 --> 04:00.840
on some of the best vacations
of our lives.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.360
Call him.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.360
ADRIAN:
Really?

04:10.360 --> 04:11.520
Oh.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.680
Oh.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.320
You're gonna love him.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.840
ADRIAN:
Wow.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.040
‐ Hello.
ADRIAN: Hi.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.400
LUCY: Hi.
‐ You must be Lucia and Adrian.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.840
‐ Yes.
‐ Um, I go by Lucy, but...

04:43.640 --> 04:47.160
‐ Can we get a name change
from "Lucia" to "Lucy," please?

04:47.160 --> 04:48.440
‐ Oh.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.480
‐ I'm Dr. Hindle's
head nurse, Dawn.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.360
Let me just get you started
with some paperless paperwork.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.680
And Rita...

04:59.680 --> 05:02.520
can help out with refreshments.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.560
‐ Do you want a, uh,
espresso or something?

05:04.560 --> 05:06.320
‐ Sure.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.760
‐ Enjoy it while you can.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.280
‐ Go ahead.
Take a seat.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.280
‐ I'm changing
the file name now.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.480
LUCY:
Thank you.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.720
ADRIAN: Here.
Rita recommended that for you.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.800
‐ Mmm.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.880
‐ Gonna be good.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.480
Adrian.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.520
ADRIAN: Hey.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.920
‐ So nice to see you.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.560
‐ Yeah, it's been a long time,
hasn't it?

06:05.560 --> 06:07.640
‐ Yes, it has indeed.
Hello, Lucy.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.280
‐ Hi.
JOHN: Lovely to meet you.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.360
‐ Such a pleasure to meet you.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.080
‐ So...you two need
a little help.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.200
‐ Uh, y‐yeah.
‐ Yeah.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.240
We've been trying pretty hard
for two years.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.600
‐ Yes. I know.
Adrian told me.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.200
LUCY:
I don't get it.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.440
I...thought I have been
doing everything right.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.560
I eat well.
I exercise.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.920
I haven't even had a drink
for two years.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.280
‐ I don't want you
to have to question

06:39.280 --> 06:41.280
everything you're doing.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.400
I will give you
the best possible chance

06:43.400 --> 06:45.360
of getting pregnant.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.920
How does that sound?

06:46.920 --> 06:48.320
‐ That sounds great.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.400
JOHN:
Good.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.840
Oh, thank you, Dawn.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.040
‐ Hm.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.560
‐ Did you know that Adrian

07:25.560 --> 07:28.160
was the most talented surgeon
I ever taught?

07:28.160 --> 07:29.480
‐ Oh, God.
Stop it.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.200
JOHN:
There was this one woman,

07:31.200 --> 07:34.080
she had breast cancer,
and the hospital wouldn't pay

07:34.080 --> 07:36.720
for a post‐mastectomy
augmentation.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.440
So your husband,

07:38.440 --> 07:41.240
he just goes and does it
without telling anyone.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.200
‐ Well, I‐I told her.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.240
JOHN: Yes, and the board wanted
me to let you go.

07:46.240 --> 07:50.600
I told them, "If he goes, I go."

07:50.600 --> 07:53.720
I was sick of teaching at
the hospital anyway, so I quit.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.360
We should've started our own
practice right then and there.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.080
‐ Yeah. Would've been great.
Lot of work, though.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.400
JOHN:
Mm, I know it's hard.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.880
Sometimes I wish
I could clone myself.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.320
It's the only way
I'd get the job done.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.600
Okay.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.880
Your architecture is great.
‐ Oh.

08:12.880 --> 08:16.600
‐ Problem is low hCG levels.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.240
We'll give you a little boost
post‐ and pre‐insemination,

08:20.240 --> 08:22.240
monitor your numbers from there.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.680
‐ That's it?

08:27.320 --> 08:28.640
‐ Yes.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.040
‐ Really?

08:30.040 --> 08:31.600
I've just been tested
so many times.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.040
‐ All these women‐‐

08:34.040 --> 08:37.720
All these women here
had troubles.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.200
Some‐‐ Some worse than you.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.120
All happy mums I've sent home
with babies.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.080
We have IUI and IVF.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.160
IVF makes babies in a test tube.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.840
IUI makes them inside of you.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.640
I've invented a method
that's a little of both.

08:56.640 --> 09:01.400
I like to call it, um,
in utero Hindle fertilization.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.120
You can help me with that one,

09:03.120 --> 09:05.360
as you're the marketing genius.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.880
Okay.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.000
‐ Oh.
Well, then, thank you, John.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.680
JOHN: It's a pleasure.
‐ Yeah.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.440
‐ Thank you so much, Dr. Hindle.
Thank you.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.000
‐ Luce? Got five?

09:34.800 --> 09:37.600
Dirk's considering making you
lead on the Wyth account.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.640
‐ Oh, my God!

09:40.640 --> 09:42.360
Are you serious?
‐ Yes!

09:42.360 --> 09:44.240
Mihail's managing four clients.

09:44.240 --> 09:48.000
I've got six, and I was like,
"What about Lucy?"

09:48.000 --> 09:50.800
‐ Greg, you said that?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.640
Thank you so much.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.440
‐ Of course.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.560
He wants to see Bryon's ideas
before pulling the trigger.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.840
‐ Of course.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.280
‐ But you're what this pitch
needs.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.480
Some female intuition.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.880
Although I like to think I cover
a little of that myself.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.680
Now, if this works out,

10:06.680 --> 10:08.640
it's gonna come
with more responsibility.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.120
Travel, more money.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.640
Luce, I'm fighting for you.

10:15.640 --> 10:20.440
Also...I'm thinking
Dig In for lunch.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.480
What do you think?

10:21.480 --> 10:23.080
‐ I'm obsessed with Dig In.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.520
I'll start an order.
‐ Great.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.160
I'm gonna do the, uh,
grilled tofu market bowl

10:27.160 --> 10:29.800
and a side
of wilted beet greens.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.760
‐ Yum. I'm gonna do the same.
‐ Mm.

10:50.360 --> 10:53.240
‐ Is there anything else
I can do for you?

10:53.240 --> 10:56.160
‐ No.
Uh...thank you.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.280
‐ Okay.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.440
ADRIAN:

11:22.680 --> 11:25.160
‐ Lucy, would you like to watch?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.000
‐ Oh. No.
DAWN: Here you go.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.400
‐ Perfect.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.680
Okay.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.360
JOHN:
Okay.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.200
‐ Mm.
DAWN: Rita.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.600
‐ Good work, son.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.240
This is powerful stuff.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.400
Mm.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.200
Oh.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.880
Brilliant.

12:45.880 --> 12:46.920
Hmm.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.760
ADRIAN:

13:03.400 --> 13:04.680
MIHAIL:
She looks like a smart shopper.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.160
BRYON: Why are you fighting me
on this?

13:06.160 --> 13:08.320
MIHAIL: Okay, Luce,
what do you think of her?

13:11.080 --> 13:14.440
She's kind of too runway.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.560
I think of Wyth as more
"girl on the subway" hot.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.040
MIHAIL: Thank you.
That's what I said.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.080
We need subway hot, not runway.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.840
BRYON:
Subway hot?

13:22.840 --> 13:24.800
Okay.
What about this one?

13:29.640 --> 13:32.120
‐ Um...

13:32.120 --> 13:34.520
I'll be back in a second.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.440
You are...

13:56.440 --> 13:58.680
100% pregnant.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.080
Oh, my God!

14:02.080 --> 14:04.640
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.120
Oh, my God.
‐

14:08.200 --> 14:10.920
Oh, my God. Thank you.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.240
Thank you, Dr. Hindle.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.880
‐ Come on. Stop it.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.000
I'm almost done.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.400
‐ Alright.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.440
You go.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.320
‐ After all that?
‐ Yes.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.360
Okay. Fine.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.880
If we have a girl...

14:35.880 --> 14:37.280
ADRIAN:
Mm‐hmm.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.400
‐ ...Wendy.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.440
‐ Oh, Luce.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.040
That's perfect.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.160
‐ We can make Wendy
a little Peter Pan costume,

14:50.160 --> 14:52.480
in honor of your mom.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.720
‐ That would be nice.
ADRIAN: Mm.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.080
Okay.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.520
I'm only gonna do boys' names
from now on.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.840
‐ Okay.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.280
‐ What about...

15:06.280 --> 15:07.680
Adrian?

15:11.640 --> 15:14.240
‐ As in Junior?

15:14.240 --> 15:16.120
‐ Kind of cool, right?

15:37.560 --> 15:39.240
Hey.

15:39.240 --> 15:43.000
Um, I will take orders
in just a couple minutes, um,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.760
but I wanted to talk to you
about something.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.520
‐ Sure.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.560
Are you, uh, feeling nervous
about the pitch?

15:53.680 --> 15:59.640
‐ Actually, I wanted
to let you know that I...

15:59.640 --> 16:01.720
am pregnant.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.640
GREG:
I knew it!

16:03.640 --> 16:05.160
I seriously have some sort

16:05.160 --> 16:06.920
of women's‐intuition thing
going on.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.840
GREG: You have been glowing!

16:09.840 --> 16:11.640
‐ Oh. Thank you.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.400
‐ Alright.
What's up?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.800
‐ Oh.
GREG: Tell him.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.160
Go on, tell him.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.680
‐ Okay.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.120
I'm pregnant.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.920
‐ Yes!
‐ Aww!

16:24.920 --> 16:27.160
No wonder you've been glowing.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.680
‐ That's what I just said!

16:28.680 --> 16:30.560
‐ I literally said that
to my wife last night.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.800
I was like, "Lucy is glowing."

16:32.800 --> 16:35.720
‐ You guys, thank you.
That's so sweet.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.080
‐ Hey, let's get
a really good lunch today.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.440
Whatever you want.
Even better than Dig In.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.800
‐ What about Wyth?

16:46.160 --> 16:49.040
‐ You know,
it might not be a bad idea

16:49.040 --> 16:50.680
to let them know
you're expecting.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.600
Make them feel bad
if they don't hire us.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.840
‐ Yeah, and, I mean,
if you're not showing by then,

16:55.840 --> 16:57.520
we'll just plump you up
with a pillow.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.120
‐ Yeah.
Wyth has really nice pillows.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.680
GREG: That's right.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.160
‐ Mm‐hmm.
Thank you, Dawn.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.440
Oh.
Wonderful, wonderful.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.400
Hm.

17:17.320 --> 17:19.720
Right.
Here we go.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.400
‐ Oh, my God.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.680
Is that a...

17:29.680 --> 17:31.040
‐ Yep.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.800
JOHN:
And there's the second.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.600
Twin set.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.880
Males.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.720
We have twin boys!

17:46.720 --> 17:48.840
DAWN: Twins.
‐

17:48.840 --> 17:52.280
‐ And...the third.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.840
Female singlet.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.160
‐ Wow.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.120
JOHN:
Just relax.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.480
DAWN: Just relax.
Water, please.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.400
‐ Relax.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.400
This is absolutely normal

18:23.400 --> 18:25.520
for how aggressive we boosted
your numbers.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.040
I was not gonna send you home
empty‐handed.

18:28.040 --> 18:32.640
So, we've got twin boys
and a female singlet,

18:32.640 --> 18:35.000
total of three.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.360
Now...

18:37.360 --> 18:39.480
selective reduction.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.520
Far be it from me
to tell you what to do,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.800
but with your history
and these elevated numbers,

18:43.800 --> 18:47.040
we're looking at an increase
of possible complications.

18:48.320 --> 18:53.520
‐ Preemies or,
worse, miscarriage.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.600
‐ By reduction, uh, you mean...

18:59.600 --> 19:01.240
an abortion?

19:03.560 --> 19:08.160
We'd be making a sacrifice
to ensure a successful birth.

19:08.160 --> 19:12.640
Either the boys, because they
share the same sac, or the girl.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.440
Now, I would strongly recommend
we keep the boys.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.520
They look healthy.
And the girl?

19:18.520 --> 19:20.760
Well, she's a bit small.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.400
‐ Um...

19:26.640 --> 19:29.000
C‐‐ Uh...

19:29.000 --> 19:31.200
Could we...

19:31.200 --> 19:34.400
Like, is there‐‐

19:34.400 --> 19:35.840
‐ It's okay.
‐ Sorry.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.120
I‐I just don't want to make
the wrong choice.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.040
‐ Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.080
I will not let that happen.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.760
‐ Yeah.

19:45.760 --> 19:50.240
‐ The odds of you having a baby
have just increased 100%.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.000
But yes.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.680
You do have a decision to make.

19:56.680 --> 19:57.920
‐ Thank you.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.520
JOHN:
Adrian, can I have a word?

19:59.520 --> 20:00.800
‐ Okay.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.320
DAWN:
I know, sweetie.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.160
It's a lot to think about.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.560
‐ Yeah.
Thanks.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.760
WAITER: I heard we have
a celebration this evening.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.680
‐ We did it.

20:41.680 --> 20:42.920
‐ I'm pregnant.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.640
‐ Yes, we're pregnant.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.880
Come on.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.280
It's expensive.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.480
Do you want to talk about it?

21:01.480 --> 21:03.760
‐ I'm still processing
the whole thing.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.440
Aren't you?

21:05.440 --> 21:07.120
ADRIAN:
Yeah.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.840
But I agree with Dr. Hindle.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.640
I think we should have the boys.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.720
‐ You do?

21:13.720 --> 21:16.240
‐ You said you've always wanted
a sibling.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.800
You know, a lot of your quirks
are from being an only child.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.920
Uh...

21:19.920 --> 21:21.840
‐ Two at once is a lot.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.800
‐ Look.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.120
What do you think
the chances are

21:26.120 --> 21:28.640
of us being able
to get pregnant again?

21:32.200 --> 21:34.080
ADRIAN:
Slim.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.880
I‐I'm saying that for myself,

21:35.880 --> 21:37.560
'cause I'm getting
up there, too.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.200
‐ What about Wyth?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.120
‐ I'll just take on more clients
if you want to quit work.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.640
‐ I don't want to stop working.
I'm just starting to get ahead.

21:44.640 --> 21:47.560
‐ Babe, we've always talked
about having more than one.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.280
‐ Yeah, that was before
we couldn't have any.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.880
‐ Yeah, which is why I'm saying
that we should have‐‐

21:55.920 --> 21:59.680
You asked me my opinion,
so I gave it to you.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.000
‐ I want the girl.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.440
I've always seen her,

22:08.440 --> 22:14.160
pictured us lying together
in bed, staring at each other.

22:14.160 --> 22:20.120
And she would see through me
with these clear eyes,

22:20.120 --> 22:23.680
right past me to some
better version of myself.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.720
‐ Come here.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.840
ADRIAN: I hear everything
that you're saying.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.040
I just don't want you to regret
your decision.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.360
‐ Are you serious?

22:40.360 --> 22:42.840
‐ Would you like to hear
this evening's specials?

22:42.840 --> 22:45.400
‐ Uh, yes.
That would be great.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.080
‐ Tonight we have
a pan‐roasted duck.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.000
It is in a persimmon glaze

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
served with a side of roasted
local root vegetables.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
We also have a homemade
tagliatelle pasta

22:54.000 --> 22:57.760
with black‐pepper cream sauce
with foraged mushrooms on top.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.800
I'm sorry
if I made you feel bad.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.520
‐ It's okay.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.120
‐ Let's have Wendy.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.560
It's what you want.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.600
‐ Are you sure?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.720
‐ I mean, if you are.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.440
‐ Oh.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.440
Thank you. I love you.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.680
‐ I love you, too.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.360
‐ What?

24:23.440 --> 24:26.480
‐ John wants me to present him
with some big award.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.280
Probably just wants to embarrass
me with a story or whatever,

24:30.280 --> 24:31.280
but...

24:31.280 --> 24:32.840
‐ Well, you have to do it.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.600
That's some real exposure.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.720
‐ Yeah, then I have to write
a speech, then I have to‐‐

24:36.720 --> 24:39.160
‐ I'll write it for you.
Duh.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.320
‐ Are you serious?

24:40.320 --> 24:41.560
LUCY:
Of course.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.080
He got us pregnant.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.480
You owe him.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.560
‐ Yeah.
LUCY:

24:46.560 --> 24:48.920
‐ Well, can't argue with that.

25:25.040 --> 25:29.280
‐ Lucy, you're not gonna be
doing this on your own.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.760
You should join a mommy group
or something.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.920
‐ That's a great idea.
‐ Yeah.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.760
‐ I wish one of my friends
was pregnant.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.600
You know, Eden doesn't even have
that boyfriend anymore,

25:40.600 --> 25:41.720
and Alyson is like‐‐

25:41.720 --> 25:43.200
‐ Alyson's Alyson.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.120
Come on.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.600
You know you love them.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.720
They're just‐‐

25:47.720 --> 25:49.600
‐ Loud?

25:49.600 --> 25:54.000
‐ I was gonna say young,
but they are also loud.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.680
‐ Mm.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.480
‐ So then I got into
part‐time food styling.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.280
I was just like, "Fuck it."

26:01.280 --> 26:02.880
‐ That's awesome.
‐ Good for you.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.600
‐ Yeah.
‐ That's great.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.680
Um, well, I'm Corgan.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.560
Uh, I'm a paralegal,

26:09.560 --> 26:13.280
and I'm 17 weeks pregnant
with Rafe,

26:13.280 --> 26:15.040
like "Ralph" but French.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.720
‐ Oh. Cute.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.600
‐ My husband, Brad, is a lawyer
at Goldman, in house.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.720
Um, and we're just so excited.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.640
We did a bunch of rounds of IVF,

26:26.640 --> 26:29.360
and, you know,
third time's the charm.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.000
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.280
‐ We tried two times,
and this one finally stuck.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.640
‐ Good, good.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.920
‐ I kind of went
a little off the deep end.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.080
‐ Mommy brain is a real thing.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.880
‐ Oh, girl.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.360
‐ We did IVF, too.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.680
‐ Oh.
Who'd you go to?

26:49.680 --> 26:51.360
‐ The Hindle Women's Center.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.440
‐ Oh, my God.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.520
I was on a wait list there
for a year and a half

26:55.520 --> 26:56.680
before we gave up.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.320
‐ Oh. Wow.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.440
‐ Can I ask how long
you had to wait?

27:00.440 --> 27:03.920
‐ Um, I actually didn't

27:03.920 --> 27:07.040
because my husband, uh, was
his student in medical school.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.280
‐ Oh, my God. How lucky.
WOMAN: Wow.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.080
‐ Well, what kind of doctor
is he?

27:11.080 --> 27:14.640
‐ Adrian is a reconstructive
surgeon at Sloan Kettering.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.640
‐ Uh, does he do
mommy makeovers?

27:16.640 --> 27:18.320
‐ Yeah.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.040
‐ Can you get, like,
a Hindle C‐section

27:20.040 --> 27:21.680
and a tummy tuck
all in one shot?

27:21.680 --> 27:24.240
‐ I never thought about that,
but I'm gonna ask him.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.600
‐ I would really like
to get in on that plan, right?

27:26.600 --> 27:29.400
‐ Uh, yeah.
‐ Can we get a family discount?

27:29.400 --> 27:32.800
‐ Yeah. But you're so tiny,
you probably won't even need it.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.840
‐ Oh.
WOMAN: You are gonna be huge!

27:35.840 --> 27:37.520
‐ Thank you.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.280
ADRIAN: Lucy.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.800
Are you ready?

28:10.640 --> 28:12.680
‐ Yeah.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.080
‐ There's no need
to be worried, Lucy.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.720
I've done this procedure
thousands of times

28:18.720 --> 28:21.400
over the past 30 years.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.200
‐ Dr. Hindle is an innovator
in the field.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.600
You are with truly the best
in the biz.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.200
I swear I didn't tell her
to say that.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.440
You are in good...

28:37.440 --> 28:41.120
and hopefully warm hands.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.200
LUCY:

28:45.600 --> 28:48.240
JOHN:
Okay.

28:48.240 --> 28:50.520
You're gonna feel
a little pinch.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.080
Just breathe deeply.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.400
JOHN:
Very good.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.320
Breathe.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.120
JOHN:
Deeply.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.800
In through your nose.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.000
And out through your mouth.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.040
Breathe.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.480
JOHN:
I've perfected the technique.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.160
ADRIAN:
Do you think she can hear us?

29:30.160 --> 29:32.480
JOHN: No, no, no, no.
She's out cold.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.880
She'll get
her fairy‐tale ending.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.720
LUCY:
Wendy.

29:54.440 --> 29:58.320
Wendy, it's time to go,
sweetheart.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.040
ADRIAN:
Hey.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.920
‐ You zonked out on us.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.640
How are you feeling?

30:23.640 --> 30:26.200
Okay, I guess.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.000
ADRIAN:
Well, you can just rest up now.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.360
JOHN: Lucy, I want you to think
of this as a fresh start.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.480
Okay?

30:34.480 --> 30:36.560
‐ Okay.
JOHN: Good.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.640
Oh, Dawn.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.320
‐ Okay, sweetie.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.920
You might not want to tell
anyone about this.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.080
You know,
there's so much judgment

30:52.080 --> 30:54.280
and misinformation out there.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.920
‐ Yes. You feel free
to call us any time.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.080
Visit any time you wish.

31:02.280 --> 31:06.120
‐ What happens to...the twins?

31:06.120 --> 31:08.680
‐ What do you mean?

31:08.680 --> 31:13.600
‐ The, um...reductions.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.760
JOHN: Reduced fetuses
attach to the placenta

31:17.760 --> 31:20.560
and get extracted
with the afterbirth.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.640
‐ So they won't affect Wendy?

31:24.640 --> 31:27.120
JOHN: No.
No, no, no.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.080
She's all taken care of.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.440
‐ Thank you so much, Doctor.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.440
JOHN: Oh.
Let's have a hug, shall we?

31:33.440 --> 31:35.360
There we go.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.760
Mm!

31:38.240 --> 31:40.720
You rest now.
Adrian?

31:40.720 --> 31:42.600
‐ Thanks, man.
JOHN: Yes.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.040
Good man.
Good man.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.840
And when is she gonna start
calling me John?

31:45.840 --> 31:47.280
‐ Well, that's up to‐‐
‐ Oh.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.040
‐ Thank you, John.
JOHN: Bye, now.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.840
‐ Try to enjoy
some quality mom time.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.680
You deserve it.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.360
Remember, you're pregnant.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.840
‐ You know, I...

32:11.840 --> 32:16.000
thought I heard these weird
things during the reduction,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.720
you and Hindle talking about...

32:18.720 --> 32:20.280
I don't know.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.720
ADRIAN:
Really?

32:22.720 --> 32:24.680
Must've been dreaming.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.280
Right up here, Mohammad.
Thank you.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.000
‐ Yeah.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.720
Yeah.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.600
JOHN: The Internet is full
of misinformation.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.520
I don't want you
getting paranoid.

33:18.520 --> 33:24.480
What you have is called OHSS‐‐
ovarian hyperstimulation.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.880
Actually, it's a good thing.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.520
Your uterus is making room,
so it stretches,

33:30.520 --> 33:34.800
sometimes a little too thin,
and it bleeds.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.680
‐ So you're not concerned?

33:37.640 --> 33:39.240
‐ No.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.520
Now, there'll be
no more googling.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.720
Understood?

34:52.760 --> 34:57.120
LUCY: The choices Wyth have made
are subtle but powerful,

34:57.120 --> 35:01.640
elevating yourselves in
a marketplace full of basics.

35:01.640 --> 35:06.360
We here at Liegler want to
re‐fashion your consumers,

35:06.360 --> 35:09.680
your "fans," as co‐creators.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.440
GREG:
You fucking killed it!

35:13.360 --> 35:15.440
‐ I did, didn't I?

35:15.440 --> 35:17.440
‐ I've known Coraline
for decades,

35:17.440 --> 35:21.600
started a crew together,
and she's a, um...

35:21.600 --> 35:22.800
How do I say it?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.200
MIHAIL:
Let's say, uh, tepid.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.160
‐ Exactly.
For her to say, "I like it"?

35:27.160 --> 35:28.640
Wow!
GREG: No, no, no, no.

35:28.640 --> 35:31.800
She said, "I like it very much,"

35:31.800 --> 35:34.560
and that it was very smart.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.840
BRYON: That's a big compliment
coming from a...

35:36.840 --> 35:39.080
let's say genius.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.360
ADRIAN:

35:57.640 --> 36:01.200
‐ I didn't even
hear you come in.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.080
Okay.
Guess what.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.560
‐ What?

36:05.560 --> 36:09.360
‐ I nailed the pitch, and
I get to lead the Wyth account.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.680
‐ That's amazing.

36:13.680 --> 36:16.680
LUCY: Am I gonna be one
of those women who has it all?

36:16.680 --> 36:21.600
My career, my kids,
my old man by my side?

36:21.600 --> 36:23.520
‐ Who you calling old?

36:23.520 --> 36:25.240
‐ Whoo!

36:25.240 --> 36:27.360
Oh, my God.
That's so scary.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.000
‐ Apparently, umbilical cords

36:29.000 --> 36:30.640
are supposed to have
two arteries,

36:30.640 --> 36:34.000
and mine only has one,
because of course it does.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.040
‐ I'm so sorry.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.520
‐ Half the babies born with this

36:36.520 --> 36:39.720
have all sorts
of awful complications.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.680
I mean, horrible things
like deformities.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.840
‐ Oh, God.
CORGAN: I just can't‐‐

36:44.840 --> 36:46.520
I just...

36:46.520 --> 36:48.720
Dr. Davis says I essentially
have to be on bed rest

36:48.720 --> 36:50.920
from here on out, which...

36:50.920 --> 36:52.760
I guess is okay,
'cause I can quit now

36:52.760 --> 36:54.760
and not have to waddle into work
for the next five months.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.880
‐ You're‐‐ You're gonna quit?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.360
‐ Oh, Brad and I decided.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.760
I mean, if something happened
to baby Rafe

36:59.760 --> 37:02.840
and I hadn't done
everything that I could,

37:02.840 --> 37:04.640
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.200
‐ Maybe you could do
a little work from home.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.120
‐ Oh, please.
I'm so ready to check out.

37:11.760 --> 37:14.240
‐ At least you won't have to
figure out where to pump.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.120
‐ Right?
Like, "Oh, excuse me, guys.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.440
I'm just gonna go pump
in the broom closet real quick.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.520
Pump on the toilet."

37:20.520 --> 37:22.600
‐ I'm actually gonna pump
on the subway

37:22.600 --> 37:24.640
'cause it's less awkward
than at work.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.720
Oh, thank you
for making me laugh.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.920
Do you have your notes?

37:43.920 --> 37:45.160
‐ Yes.

37:45.160 --> 37:46.800
Thank you, by the way.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.520
‐ Use them.
Don't read them.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.760
‐ Yes.
I know, I know.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.920
‐ Just get that centered.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.320
‐ Did you hear that?

37:58.320 --> 37:59.320
‐ Yeah.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.440
I'm gonna take a look.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.440
Nothing.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.760
‐ Oh.

38:46.280 --> 38:49.480
‐ What can you say about a man

38:49.480 --> 38:53.040
who has fundamentally
changed fertility?

38:53.040 --> 38:56.880
The truth is,
you can't really say enough.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.760
Not in words.

38:59.760 --> 39:03.040
But you can see it.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.320
You can see it in the eyes
of a mother

39:05.320 --> 39:08.200
looking at her newborn
for the first time,

39:08.200 --> 39:12.200
seeing her purpose, her destiny.

39:12.800 --> 39:16.200
You can see it in the giddiness
and that nervous energy

39:16.200 --> 39:18.160
of new parents
bringing their baby home,

39:18.160 --> 39:20.480
full of wonder and awe.

39:21.560 --> 39:26.120
I'm filled with
an enormous warmth tonight,

39:26.120 --> 39:28.480
being with John's peers,
of course,

39:28.480 --> 39:31.400
and honoring him
for the fifth time in a row.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.520
Dr. John Hindle.

39:55.640 --> 39:59.000
‐ Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen and honored guests.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.160
Basic science.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.360
The fundamental foundation
of our economic, social,

40:05.360 --> 40:09.520
and environmental progress
is under attack.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.120
‐ Hi, Mama.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.480
‐ Hey, Daddy.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.280
‐ I got you something.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.480
‐ Adrian.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.440
We are nowhere near
being able to celebrate yet.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.760
I don't want to jinx it, mister.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.240
‐ I'm celebrating...

40:34.240 --> 40:36.840
because we've been through
so much already.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.480
‐

40:42.080 --> 40:44.040
ADRIAN:
It's different this time.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.400
‐ Adrian.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.920
‐ You deserve it.

40:49.920 --> 40:55.280
‐ These are difficult times,
challenging times.

40:55.280 --> 41:00.040
But there is no greater reward
than to see a young mother

41:00.040 --> 41:04.800
who has toiled with
a burning desire to give life

41:04.800 --> 41:08.880
and who now lies before me
with her infant on her breast,

41:08.880 --> 41:14.520
spent with exhaustion
and euphoria of birth,

41:14.520 --> 41:18.280
to look into that child's eyes

41:18.280 --> 41:22.040
and to know that I've been part
of their existence in this life.

41:22.040 --> 41:26.920
That is the true gift
of my work.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.440
‐ I'd like to put it on you.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.840
‐ Okay.

41:34.800 --> 41:38.440
It is...very beautiful.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.440
Honestly, thank you so much.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.600
JOHN:
We are building a generation,

42:01.600 --> 42:03.000
progressing families,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.760
and giving mothers
their fairy‐tale ending.

42:07.760 --> 42:10.480
It's why I'm here.

42:10.480 --> 42:14.040
Tonight...and always.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.000
On behalf of all the families

42:16.000 --> 42:21.160
whose lives I am now
forever part of...

42:21.160 --> 42:24.360
I humbly accept this award.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.560
‐ Does your doctor claim
to know more about your body

43:00.560 --> 43:02.560
than you do?

43:02.560 --> 43:05.040
That your body is high‐risk?

44:29.080 --> 44:31.720
ADRIAN: Hey! Whoa. Hey.
LUCY:

44:31.720 --> 44:34.160
‐ Relax.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.360
What are you doing?
‐ I th‐‐

44:36.360 --> 44:39.680
I thought I‐I heard someone.

44:39.680 --> 44:42.040
‐ Oh.

44:42.040 --> 44:43.840
It's alright.
Come here.

44:45.280 --> 44:47.480
‐ Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.280
‐ We managed to get
a second opinion,

45:00.280 --> 45:03.800
and we're feeling so much better
about Rafe and everything.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.880
‐ Are you serious?
CORGAN: Yeah.

45:05.880 --> 45:08.080
‐ That's such a relief.
CORGAN: It is.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.000
‐ Oh, I'm so happy to hear that.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.720
‐ How are you?

45:12.720 --> 45:14.120
‐ I'm good.

45:18.320 --> 45:20.560
I'm okay.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.080
‐ Are you?

45:22.080 --> 45:26.640
‐ I‐I just‐‐
I'm starting to feel nervous.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.080
‐ Oh.

45:28.080 --> 45:31.520
‐ A little...crazy.
I‐I'm seeing things.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.440
‐ Honey, me too.

45:33.440 --> 45:36.840
I'm having the wildest
mommy brain lately.

45:36.840 --> 45:40.640
I don't‐‐
I don't think it's mommy brain.

45:40.640 --> 45:44.240
Something's...not right
with Wendy.

45:45.800 --> 45:48.440
‐ What do you mean?
Did Dr. Hindle say something?

45:50.600 --> 45:53.920
‐ No.
I‐I‐I think Dr. Hindle...

45:53.920 --> 45:56.720
did something to Wendy.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.280
‐ Lucy.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.280
No.
I mean, that's‐‐

46:03.280 --> 46:04.840
You're just...

46:04.840 --> 46:07.280
This is a lot.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.680
Have you talked to Adrian
about how you're feeling?

46:09.680 --> 46:12.480
I really think‐‐
‐ No. I think Adrian's in on it.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.440
‐ In on what?

46:28.280 --> 46:32.920
‐ That's why I'm‐‐ I'm thinking
of using this midwife instead.

46:32.920 --> 46:33.920
CORGAN:
Lucy.

46:35.480 --> 46:38.400
This is not like Rafe.

46:38.400 --> 46:41.600
Unless something
is really wrong,

46:41.600 --> 46:43.800
you should not be making
sweeping changes

46:43.800 --> 46:45.800
to your birth plan.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.080
‐ Yeah.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.520
‐ Hey.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.160
This pregnancy shit is no joke.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.320
Right?
‐ Yeah.

46:55.320 --> 46:57.440
CORGAN:
Okay, it's really scary.

46:57.440 --> 47:00.040
But you are not alone.

47:00.640 --> 47:02.840
‐ Thank you, Corgan.

47:04.440 --> 47:06.400
‐ I'm gonna hop on the bike.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.240
If you want to pass out
before I come back in,

47:08.240 --> 47:10.000
I'll be quiet
when I come back in.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.240
‐ Okay.
‐ Alright.

47:11.240 --> 47:12.520
Unless you want me to stay.

47:12.520 --> 47:14.600
‐ No, no.
Enjoy.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.240
‐ Alright.

47:28.120 --> 47:32.400
‐ Does your doctor claim
to know more about your body

47:32.400 --> 47:34.320
than you do?

47:34.320 --> 47:37.600
That your body is high‐risk?

47:37.600 --> 47:39.360
Do you feel disenfranchised

47:39.360 --> 47:43.280
by what swirls around us
regarding motherhood,

47:43.280 --> 47:47.880
trying to get pregnant, work,
your birth plan?

47:47.880 --> 47:51.120
Feeling connected
to your changing body,

47:51.120 --> 47:54.320
longing for
a deeper experience?

47:54.320 --> 47:56.080
Hi.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.040
I'm Grace Singleton.

47:58.040 --> 48:01.640
And I believe
that women are gifted

48:01.640 --> 48:06.520
with the highest‐potential
purpose for humankind.

48:06.520 --> 48:09.920
I became a midwife because
I wanted women to connect

48:09.920 --> 48:12.240
with this planet's most powerful

48:12.240 --> 48:17.120
and phenomenal instrument‐‐
their bodies.

48:17.120 --> 48:22.160
We have a spiritual current
that flows through us.

48:22.160 --> 48:26.800
We are vessels
for a cosmic feat.

48:26.800 --> 48:32.680
That privilege makes women the
strongest people on the earth.

48:32.680 --> 48:36.440
Modern gynecology stands
on the shoulders of men

48:36.440 --> 48:40.560
who thought the womb
was an unruly creature

48:40.560 --> 48:42.680
inside a woman's body.

48:42.680 --> 48:46.480
Doctors said labor was traumatic

48:46.480 --> 48:48.760
and that we needed
to be subdued.

48:48.760 --> 48:53.560
Suddenly, we can't handle
the pain as our ancestors did,

48:53.560 --> 48:56.280
billions of women before us,

48:56.280 --> 48:58.840
as if birth was broken

48:58.840 --> 49:02.720
before these men came up
with the solutions.

49:02.720 --> 49:08.400
They fear, loathe,
and covet that power,

49:08.400 --> 49:11.440
and always under
the guise of concern.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.520
We've been robbed
of experiencing

49:13.520 --> 49:19.320
the richness of this process
in all its messy,

49:19.320 --> 49:22.640
complex, awesome entirety.

49:23.240 --> 49:26.800
Letting them make
the decisions for us‐‐

49:26.800 --> 49:29.800
That's what I call high‐risk.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.240
Lucy, how do you feel right now?

49:37.640 --> 49:40.640
‐ I feel like
my head is spinning.

49:40.640 --> 49:46.160
‐ Confront whatever it is
that's blocking you from you.

49:46.160 --> 49:48.160
Let it out.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.520
From your gut.

49:51.720 --> 49:52.880
GRACE:
Go.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.920
Go, Lucy.

49:54.920 --> 49:57.240
Let it out.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.280
GRACE: Remember how
you're feeling right now.

50:08.280 --> 50:10.400
Empowered.

50:11.320 --> 50:13.200
Free.

50:13.200 --> 50:14.360
ADRIAN:
Lucy.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.280
You alright?

50:18.360 --> 50:19.880
‐ Yeah.

50:19.880 --> 50:21.240
‐ I thought I heard you scream.

50:22.240 --> 50:25.640
‐ I‐I...

50:25.640 --> 50:28.000
I must've been dreaming.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.760
‐ Okay.
Um...

50:30.760 --> 50:34.600
Well...time to turn off
your iPad.

50:34.600 --> 50:36.680
Go to bed, you millennial.

50:46.840 --> 50:48.760
GRACE:
Well, most pregnant people

50:48.760 --> 50:52.720
have had medicalized entry
into care,

50:52.720 --> 50:56.440
especially if you've
had IVF or IUI.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.640
Pregnant people are not ill.

50:58.640 --> 51:00.320
They're pregnant.

51:00.320 --> 51:04.040
GREG: How is that even within
the realm of possibility?

51:04.040 --> 51:05.800
Thank you.

51:05.800 --> 51:09.160
Well, we sent the portfolio
two‐‐ over two months ago.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.200
Yes.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.120
DAWN:
Lucy.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
LUCY:
Dawn.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.920
What are you doing here?

51:28.920 --> 51:30.640
‐ I came to get the magazine.

51:33.120 --> 51:35.880
With Dr. Hindle on the cover.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.360
‐ Oh.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.680
‐ Well, he's been working for‐‐

51:39.680 --> 51:41.800
oh, for 30 years
to get on that cover,

51:41.800 --> 51:44.800
and he doesn't appreciate
you taking it.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.560
‐ I was only borrowing it.

51:48.560 --> 51:49.680
I'll bring it back.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.640
‐ Oh.
Mommy brain.

52:24.200 --> 52:27.320
‐ Totally fine.
‐

52:27.320 --> 52:29.200
LUCY: Really? You don't need
to s‐see her or...

52:29.200 --> 52:31.520
‐ Nope.
Responding normally.

52:31.520 --> 52:33.880
Reflexes, heartbeat.

52:33.880 --> 52:36.000
You'd be surprised
at how resilient they are.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.040
It was very good
that you came in, Lucy.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.520
‐ There you go.

52:43.920 --> 52:46.760
I'm really sorry
about the magazine.

52:46.760 --> 52:50.040
JOHN: Mm.
Well, I'm sorry about Dawn.

52:50.040 --> 52:53.480
She's very loyal
and proud of my work.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.040
Dawn has worked for me
for the past 18 years

52:56.040 --> 52:58.400
and fiercely defends her family.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.560
‐ Mm. I'm so embarrassed.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.600
I really only meant
to borrow it.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.800
‐ Oh, I know that.

53:04.800 --> 53:07.720
Yes, there's a lot of voodoo
out there.

53:07.720 --> 53:10.480
We just want to make sure that
you get the best possible care.

53:11.640 --> 53:13.920
‐ Thank you, John,
for seeing us so last‐minute.

53:16.680 --> 53:18.040
‐ Oh.

53:18.040 --> 53:20.800
ADRIAN:
Thank you, buddy.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.160
JOHN:
Yes.

53:24.600 --> 53:25.840
‐ Okay.

53:39.480 --> 53:41.240
‐ Have a good night, hon.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.680
LUCY:
So?

54:21.480 --> 54:23.280
GREG:
So...

54:24.320 --> 54:28.200
after talking
to Mihail and Dirk...

54:28.200 --> 54:30.640
we worry about losing momentum.

54:30.640 --> 54:33.160
We think Bryon should lead
on the Wyth account.

54:35.240 --> 54:36.360
‐ Really?

54:36.360 --> 54:38.000
‐ You're gonna need time.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.160
It's a marathon.

54:40.160 --> 54:43.400
Luce, you don't want this to be
your first one out of the gate.

54:43.400 --> 54:46.760
‐ Are you using m‐my deck,
my ideas?

54:46.760 --> 54:48.200
‐ They loved you at Wyth.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.320
We love you at Liegler, Lucy.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.120
Come on.
Don't take this the wrong way.

54:53.520 --> 54:55.720
We just want to make sure
things go smoothly.

55:31.320 --> 55:34.520
‐ I think I'm gonna need
at least a three‐month buffer.

55:34.520 --> 55:36.880
Yeah.
Well, she's gonna need me.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.360
Huge change, yeah.

55:41.920 --> 55:44.920
J‐‐ Hey, you know what?

55:44.920 --> 55:48.400
Uh, c‐‐ can I call‐‐
can I call you right back?

55:48.400 --> 55:49.680
Thanks. Bye.

55:51.480 --> 55:52.520
You okay?

55:54.160 --> 55:55.320
‐ No.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.080
‐ Well, what's going on?

55:57.080 --> 55:59.440
LUCY: They're using my deck
and my ideas.

55:59.440 --> 56:02.280
I got the Wyth account, and now
I'm not allowed to work on it.

56:02.280 --> 56:05.200
It's okay, it's okay.

56:05.200 --> 56:10.360
I just had to get
out of there and come see you.

56:10.360 --> 56:12.600
I got you something.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.480
ADRIAN: Lucy‐‐
‐ It's really, really good.

56:14.480 --> 56:16.240
We got it at work the other day.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.240
I can't believe
we haven't had it yet.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.720
‐ What the hell's going on?

56:21.080 --> 56:22.240
‐ What?

56:22.240 --> 56:24.600
I can't bring my husband lunch?

56:27.760 --> 56:29.360
‐ You just brought me lunch.

56:44.800 --> 56:48.040
‐ Mommy brain
is a real thing, Lucy.

56:48.040 --> 56:53.120
Prepartum depression hits
about one out of five women.

56:53.120 --> 56:55.440
‐ Listen to Dr. Hindle.

56:55.440 --> 56:59.720
You should be enjoying
this process.

56:59.720 --> 57:03.920
‐ We now know that Xanax is safe
at .25 milligrams

57:03.920 --> 57:05.600
starting the third trimester.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.080
‐ This won't affect Wendy?

57:10.080 --> 57:12.240
‐ Wendy?

57:12.240 --> 57:13.800
Mm, no.
No, no.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.520
Try and take care
of yourself, Lucy, hmm?

57:19.520 --> 57:20.840
Can you do that for me?

57:23.480 --> 57:26.480
DAWN:
Smile, Lucy.

57:26.480 --> 57:29.000
It actually makes you happier.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.720
It's scientifically proven.

57:33.480 --> 57:35.080
JOHN:
There you go now.

57:52.440 --> 57:54.400
‐ Lucia Martin?

57:54.400 --> 57:56.680
LUCY:
Yes.

57:56.680 --> 57:58.880
Oh, my gosh.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.840
I can't believe
I'm actually meeting you.

58:01.840 --> 58:07.120
I'm a really big fan
of your words and your videos.

58:07.120 --> 58:10.800
Your whole thing inspires me.

58:14.800 --> 58:18.280
‐ It is highly unusual
for me to take on a client

58:18.280 --> 58:22.160
this late in the process.

58:22.160 --> 58:24.040
But you seem vulnerable.

58:25.440 --> 58:29.720
This time should feel special
and exciting,

58:29.720 --> 58:33.080
not a constant uphill battle.

58:33.080 --> 58:35.280
You have a lot to unpack.

58:42.200 --> 58:44.240
‐ My mom died a few years ago.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.800
And I've been hoping that,
with Wendy,

58:49.800 --> 58:54.320
I might get a piece of her back.

58:54.320 --> 58:56.720
But maybe it's wrong to put
that kind of pressure on her.

58:56.720 --> 59:02.560
‐ See yourself with Wendy,
loving her, nurturing her.

59:03.880 --> 59:07.080
Laughing with her.

59:07.080 --> 59:13.000
Giving her all the strength you
have been given, have earned.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.480
And look at her.

59:14.480 --> 59:16.040
Strong little lady.

59:31.920 --> 59:33.800
ADRIAN:
Hey. How you doing?

59:39.080 --> 59:41.520
RITA: You're all set.
Room 1992.

59:41.520 --> 59:42.840
ADRIAN:
Thank you very much.

1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:14.600
JOHN: Hi.
ADRIAN: John.

1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:44.040
Ohh.

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:24.760
RITA:
Room 1992.

1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:23.440
‐ I found this in Adrian's safe.

1:02:24.360 --> 1:02:25.680
‐ What is this?

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:28.480
‐ Read this.
Do you see that?

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:31.400
I‐I‐I'm part of a study?

1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:34.080
What study?
I‐I didn't sign up.

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.880
Do you see that?
An injection.

1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:39.280
Of what?

1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:40.800
Look at‐‐ Look at this.

1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:44.040
Look at these photos of me.

1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:47.920
I‐I know they did
something to Wendy.

1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:49.520
I've known it the whole time.

1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:54.040
‐ This is crazy.

1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:55.320
‐ I am not crazy.

1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:57.440
They're trying to make me
think I'm crazy.

1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:02.880
‐ Can I take this
and show this to Brad?

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.280
‐ Why?

1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:06.560
‐ To get a lawyer's perspective.

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:08.920
I mean, he's gonna need
to see this for himself.

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:10.760
He'll know your rights.

1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:13.080
‐ Right. Okay.

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:14.360
Thank you.

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:17.480
‐ Just until we know
what this is,

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:19.440
you have to act like
everything is normal.

1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:25.480
‐ Hey!

1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:27.760
Hey, look at me.

1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:30.120
You okay?
What did you do?

1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:33.360
I swallowed water.

1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:38.920
‐ There's no shame in it.

1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:19.160
‐ Morning.

1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:23.120
‐ What's happening?

1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:26.520
I'm gonna quit.

1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:29.000
‐ Eating?
‐

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.480
My job.

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:34.440
Everything.
Even Dr. Hindle.

1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:36.240
‐ You're joking.

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:40.120
‐ No. I‐I want to see
Grace Singleton.

1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:41.920
‐ Sorry. Who?

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:44.680
‐ She's this midwife I found,
and I saw her yesterday,

1:05:44.680 --> 1:05:47.560
and, Adrian, she was magical.

1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:50.880
She was just...amazing.

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:53.560
She's just more natural.

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:56.160
Hindle and them, they feel so...

1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:58.760
Ugh, like...

1:05:58.760 --> 1:06:00.600
Yeah.

1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:03.600
ARDIAN: Look, Luce, we've been
seeing him for months.

1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.040
I've known John for years.

1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:08.240
He‐‐ He's the one
that got us pregnant.

1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:10.680
‐ He got me pregnant, Adrian.

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:15.080
I don't know. I'm just
more comfortable with Grace.

1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:18.240
Dr. Hindle gives me
a bad feeling.

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:21.240
‐ So you're basing this all
on a fucking feeling?

1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:24.120
And what am I
supposed to tell John?

1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:25.400
‐ I don't know.

1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:26.800
He's your friend.

1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:29.920
‐ No.

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:31.320
No.
No, no, no.

1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:33.000
I‐I‐I have to draw
the line somewhere.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.200
‐ Well, not around
my birth story.

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:37.000
‐ Your birth story?

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:38.720
So, what, you saw a post,
and now you're‐‐

1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:41.120
you're basing
our entire baby's life

1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:43.200
on a fucking Instagram trend?

1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:50.560
Let's not forget, this is my
baby we're talking about, too.

1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:53.280
‐ Um, I invited Eden and Alyson
to the shower.

1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:55.680
It's gonna be really fun.

1:06:55.680 --> 1:06:57.480
Mmm.
‐ Oh.

1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:03.680
‐ This is delicious.
‐ So that's it?

1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:05.840
‐ Yeah.

1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:07.120
Do you want some?

1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:12.520
‐ Did you send the sonogram
over to Grace?

1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:14.120
ADRIAN:
Yeah, I told you.

1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:19.360
John is really mad
and disappointed.

1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:26.200
‐ Oh, my gosh.

1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:30.200
‐ Oh! Oh, my gosh.
‐ Take it.

1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:31.720
‐ That is gorgeous.

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:37.680
‐ To Lucia from me.

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:39.640
‐ Oh, thank you.

1:07:43.680 --> 1:07:46.040
What is this?

1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:49.120
‐ It's a first‐edition copy
of Peter Pan.

1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:52.120
It's the same one
that your mom read to you.

1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:55.400
I just wanted to do a little
something besides the shower.

1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:57.040
‐ Thank you.

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:10.360
CORGAN:
Luce?

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:14.080
‐ Earth to Lucy!

1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:17.800
‐ How did you know
my name's Lucia?

1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:23.000
‐ What?

1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:30.400
‐ I'm sorry.

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:43.920
‐ Is it baby brain
or is it mommy brain, right?

1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.800
CORGAN:
Lucy, are you okay?

1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:20.200
Hey.

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.680
Is‐‐ Is everything alright?

1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:28.240
‐ You go to John.

1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:31.600
‐ What?

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:34.560
‐ You go to John.

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:44.040
‐ I've had three miscarriages
and tried IVF three times, Lucy.

1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:45.200
I didn't have a choice.

1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:46.480
‐ When did you go?

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:48.200
‐ We were really worried
about you,

1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:51.320
and‐‐ and when I told Adrian
about my complications,

1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:52.920
he got me in.

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:55.560
‐ After everything I told you,
you went to Adrian?

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:57.360
CORGAN:
You were scaring me.

1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:02.120
You were obsessing, and‐‐
and you seemed really not well.

1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:05.360
I just thought that
your husband should know.

1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:08.640
‐ Wait.

1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:10.440
You gave him the file.

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:13.120
That was my proof, Corgan.

1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:15.000
‐ Lucy...

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.920
Adrian said there is
no safe in his office.

1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:23.280
‐ Oh, my God.

1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:32.440
GRACE:
Push!

1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:35.160
Push!

1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:37.160
Push!

1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:39.040
Push!
‐

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:41.640
GRACE: Here she comes!

1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:45.240
Here she comes, here she comes,
here she comes.

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:52.080
It's a boy.

1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:55.000
It's a boy.

1:10:56.760 --> 1:10:58.760
Oh. Oh.

1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:01.600
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:02.880
Oh, my God.

1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:06.080
Oh, my God.
You're crowning again.

1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:08.000
Okay.

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.040
‐ Oh, God.

1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:10.240
Oh, God.

1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.520
I'm having the twins!

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:17.440
‐ You need to go to the ER
right now.

1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:22.160
She's experiencing
a full placental abruption.

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:23.160
You need to go.

1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:25.680
Now!

1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:45.320
‐ You're doing great, baby.
‐ Doing great, Lucy.

1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:48.440
Just push now.
Push.

1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:49.840
Push, Lucy, push.
ADRIAN: You're doing great.

1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:51.040
It's amazing.
You're doing just amazing.

1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:53.560
JOHN:
It's coming. It's coming.

1:11:53.560 --> 1:11:55.760
The baby's head is crowning
right now.

1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:58.640
Push.
‐

1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:02.080
JOHN: And here he is.
Our second baby boy.

1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:21.760
ADRIAN: This is hard, and it's
difficult to understand,

1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:25.560
but we will work
through this together.

1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:29.680
But these are ours, and it is a
critical time to create a bond.

1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:36.400
You know, we have
been through...a lot.

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:38.040
And...

1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:39.720
this is not, um...

1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:44.280
You've been through a lot,
Luce...

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:45.840
these last couple days, and...

1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:51.800
It's overwhelming.

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:58.560
It's overwhelming.

1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:09.880
I know it seems hard right now.

1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:12.520
But this is a good thing.

1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:14.920
Wait till you see
how special these boys are.

1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:18.760
Such beautiful blue eyes.

1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:25.520
LUCY:

1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:30.120
I can't believe
this happened to me.

1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:32.680
‐ I know, I know.

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:34.240
It's crazy.

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.600
‐ What happened to your office?

1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:52.040
Wasn't it more culturally, uh...

1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:54.000
Weren't there, like...

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.920
masks and‐‐

1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:59.160
Even your outfit
looks...different.

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:03.640
‐ No.

1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:05.320
Nothing has changed.

1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:09.360
‐ Really?

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:10.520
‐ Mm.

1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:18.640
I am not your mystical
Negress, Lucy.

1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:28.800
I'm sorry.

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:34.880
Fuck.

1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:40.160
I don't even know what to do
with myself.

1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:41.320
‐ Be better.

1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:45.880
‐ How?

1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:48.520
‐ I don't have the answers.

1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:50.400
It's not my job.

1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:52.280
It's yours.

1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:38.800
‐ I need to talk to John.

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:41.120
‐ Do you have an appointment?

1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:44.760
‐ I need to talk to John
about reducing the wrong‐‐

1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:46.240
‐ This way.

1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:20.240
You have two babies
and a wonderful husband.

1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:22.440
If I were you, I would go home

1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:25.200
and spend every minute
with them...

1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:27.000
mothering them.

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.800
Just let Adrian and Hindle

1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:32.080
do the good work
they're trying to do.

1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:35.680
‐ What?

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:40.320
‐ Oh.
He didn't tell you?

1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:43.400
Oh. I thought you two
were closer than that.

1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:49.560
Uh, Rita, can you bring in the
Martin‐Hindle paperwork, please?

1:18:01.320 --> 1:18:03.120
Oh.

1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:07.760
Hm.

1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:11.640
Thank you.

1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:15.160
Mm‐hmm.

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:21.880
Adrian's joining the practice.

1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:25.760
Just think of all the good work
they're going to do.

1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:34.200
Welcome to the family.

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:18.720
LUCY:

1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:42.600
JOHN:
You poor thing.

1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:46.600
What Grace did,
morally reprehensible.

1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:49.840
And for her not to have
an affiliation with a hospital

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:51.280
should be illegal.

1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:53.080
‐ I just want Wendy.

1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:54.120
Okay?

1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:00.120
‐ This world just breaks
my heart at times.

1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:02.760
I don't know what's going on
with people these days.

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.280
We've got pedophiles
running the government,

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:07.800
terrorism in our schools.

1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:10.320
Sometimes I feel like
there's no hope,

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:12.280
no containing the onslaught.

1:20:14.280 --> 1:20:17.080
Most people don't understand
what's best for them.

1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:22.280
They search for solutions,
but God, money, magic‐‐

1:20:22.280 --> 1:20:25.600
none of these things
can fix our problems.

1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:28.920
None of them cure disease.

1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:30.520
Science does.

1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:35.760
We have a saying around here.

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:39.600
"God doesn't make babies.

1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:40.920
I do."

1:20:42.440 --> 1:20:44.160
‐ Oh, my God.

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:45.880
JOHN: When you and Adrian
came in here,

1:20:45.880 --> 1:20:48.560
you said you wanted a baby.

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:52.320
I gave you
the best genes there are.

1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:56.040
My own.

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.440
‐ You raped me.

1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:06.680
‐ Oh, please.

1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:08.320
Lucy.

1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:10.240
There's no need for hysterics.

1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:14.560
LUCY:
All I wanted was a daughter.

1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:16.240
All I wanted was Wendy.

1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:17.560
JOHN:
Mm.

1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:19.240
Yes.

1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:22.400
Well, I'm sorry about the girl.

1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:25.240
But these boys...

1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:28.440
these boys will spread the seed.

1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:33.120
Now, I wish I didn't have to
do this, but it's for the best.

1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:35.080
Don't worry.

1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:37.280
It'll be painless.

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:38.320
Ohh!

1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:23.720
‐ I trained myself
not to have a gag reflex.

1:22:44.519 --> 1:22:45.233
‐ Lucy!

1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:21.360
‐ You're gonna want to find
a new doctor.

1:23:24.920 --> 1:23:30.720
MICHAEL: Wendy, I'd so like if
you'd sing me a song for sleep.

1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:33.120
WENDY: Close your eyes, Michael,
and I'll sing.

1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:40.560
Funny the thoughts
I have at night

1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:45.280
the thoughts I have by day

1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:49.400
switches off the light

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:54.280
questions come my way

1:24:05.520 --> 1:24:08.280
in advance?

1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:11.200
by chance?

1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:11.040
‐ Oh, my God.
What happened?

1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:13.160
‐ I know what happened.

1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:19.320
You knew we were having
the boys.

1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:24.680
‐ No.
He, uh...

1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:28.280
He said he was gonna
take care of us.

1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:33.040
This deal, this is gonna be
a good thing for us, Lucy.

1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:35.040
‐ Mm.

1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:37.400
‐ Lucy.

1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:38.640
Lucy.

1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:02.680
‐ Go.

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:06.120
‐ What am I supposed to do?

1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:08.360
‐ Go!

1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:14.880
Funny the thoughts
I have at night

1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:20.000
questions come my way
