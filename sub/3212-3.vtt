(chuckles)

11:12.304 --> 11:14.873
CAROL:
Phil, that was beautiful.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.875
Now for the exchange of rings.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.778
Rings are a symbol
of the eternity of marriage.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.945
Oh, oh, shoot. They're not here.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.113
Phil, do you have the rings?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.115
Phil, did you even get them?
Be honest.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.051
Carol, I...

11:26.053 --> 11:27.285
I'm not gonna

11:27.287 --> 11:28.553
start this marriage out
with a lie.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.888
I got the rings.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.456
Phil.
God.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.625
Look me in the eyes.
Did you really get them?

11:34.660 --> 11:36.728
I started the marriage out
with a lie.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.063
I did not get the rings.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.631
That was your one job.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.965
CAROL: Carol Pilbasian,
do you take

11:40.967 --> 11:42.634
Phil Miller to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

11:42.636 --> 11:43.702
I can't do this.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.737
What?
You can't buy me
a goldarn ring?

11:45.739 --> 11:47.338
I'm trying so hard to

11:47.340 --> 11:48.707
raisin ball the hell
out of this ceremony,

11:48.709 --> 11:51.509
but you are the worst.
Just forget it.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.379
Carol. Come on.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.785
One job.

12:02.154 --> 12:04.989
CAROL: I now pronounce you
man and wife.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.058
You may kiss the bride.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.061

12:19.338 --> 12:20.505
PHIL: Carol!
(knocking)

12:20.507 --> 12:21.906
Look, I'm getting worried
about you, okay?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.509
I don't think you're in there,
but if you are,

12:24.511 --> 12:26.511
just know I'm gonna
break down your door.

12:26.513 --> 12:30.115
And this is not out of anger,
this is out of concern.

Carol, come on,

13:38.785 --> 13:39.918
please go for Phil.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.586
Look, I know that you're upset,

but I just, I really
want to talk to you.

Phil, I don't want to talk

Busy bedazzling pillows?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.605
What are you doing here?

14:00.607 --> 14:02.373
Well,

14:02.375 --> 14:05.276
I came by 'cause
I-I wanted to say something.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.078
Well, I'm listening.
Okay.

14:09.048 --> 14:12.450
Carol, you drive me crazy.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.952
You don't get
my jokes.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.287
You correct my grammar.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.122
You talk and talk and talk

14:18.124 --> 14:20.158
and talk, and you pester me
worse than my mother.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.961
It really annoys me
when-when you do that stuff.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.964
Oh, you are no picnic yourself,

14:35.809 --> 14:39.143
Look...
when I got home,

14:39.145 --> 14:42.313
and you didn't come back,
I started to get worried.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.648
Why were you worried?

14:43.650 --> 14:45.817
Please,
don't interrupt this, okay?

14:45.819 --> 14:48.553
I realized
that I'd rather

14:48.555 --> 14:52.523
eat raisin balls--
parentheses live in a world

14:52.525 --> 14:55.526
in which
I am challenged by your...

14:55.528 --> 14:57.362
tendencies...

14:57.364 --> 14:58.496
Okay.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.832
...than eat no balls at all--

15:00.834 --> 15:04.168
parentheses
go back to living alone.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.904
That's nice.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.839
I know.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.507
Phil, you were
a real scrub today.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.508
I know.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.377
You know
how I feel about scrubs.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.112
You don't want no?

15:16.282 --> 15:17.282
Yeah.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.384
Bingo.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.919
So, what do you say,
you want to go home?

15:20.921 --> 15:22.954
Huh?

15:32.231 --> 15:33.631
Wh-Where are you going?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.033
Little detour.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.205

No, you didn't.

Philip Miller,

15:45.111 --> 15:47.312
a tiny sledgehammer?

15:47.314 --> 15:49.414
I love it.
That's not the present.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.748

15:50.750 --> 15:51.749
No.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.984
What's the present?

15:54.753 --> 15:56.788
Mm, oh... that one.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.457
And that one
and those ones.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.659
Oh, that one, too.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.394
Okay.

16:06.231 --> 16:09.233
CAROL (over recording): I now

16:26.518 --> 16:27.919
Phil.

16:30.856 --> 16:33.524
Your presence is requested
in the bedroom.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.865
Um...

16:40.867 --> 16:42.533
Uh...

16:42.535 --> 16:43.534
Yeah, let's see what...

16:43.536 --> 16:44.702
Just focus on me, huh?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.504
Okay.
Mmm.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.607
Mmm.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.275
Mmm.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.276
Come on.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.378
Phil.
What?

16:53.380 --> 16:56.381
Just give yourself up
to the process.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.715
And don't worry,

16:57.717 --> 17:01.486
I've been told that I'm
very, very good at this.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.121
Oh, throw your
sleeping bag down!

17:03.123 --> 17:04.789
Phil, that's your
camping spot!

17:04.791 --> 17:06.290
You big camper!

17:06.292 --> 17:09.660
You better put the food in the
trees before the bears get it.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.995
Ah, you hear them coming?

17:10.997 --> 17:12.964
Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

17:12.966 --> 17:14.799
Nicely done, Phil!

17:14.801 --> 17:16.401
<i> And here we go!</i>

17:16.403 --> 17:18.569
<i> Oh!</i>

17:18.571 --> 17:20.538
Oh, I'm famished.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.708
After doing the nasty, I
need to have some beans.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.910
Oh, you want some beans, babe?

17:25.912 --> 17:27.311
No. No, I don't want...
No?

17:27.313 --> 17:29.313
I'm just gonna... just...

17:29.315 --> 17:31.716
sit here and,
you know, try to...

17:31.718 --> 17:34.385
figure out what just happened.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.922
Mmm.

17:37.924 --> 17:41.392
I actually have some
constructive criticisms for you.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.195
You should talk more.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.664
I like to hear what
my man has to say.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.933
Just get in there
with some sexual jibber-jabber.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.035
It will be welcomed.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.004
Carol, in all honesty, I think
we have different methods,

17:53.006 --> 17:55.173
'cause I kind of like
to church-mouse it.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.240
Ooh.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.975
What's that mouse doing
in the church?

18:00.679 --> 18:01.746
Mmm.

18:03.449 --> 18:05.283
Oh, my God, I can't believe

18:05.285 --> 18:08.419
I just had sex with the
President of the United States.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.288
(laughs)

18:20.032 --> 18:23.234
Phil Miller, what is
going on in here?

18:23.236 --> 18:25.703
Well, Carol, I'm playing
racquetball, okay?

18:25.705 --> 18:28.806
You have to know that this is
the kind of thing I do.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.708
I assume you're gonna say
you got to...

18:30.710 --> 18:33.878
go outside or go find
an official racquetball court,

18:33.880 --> 18:36.414
but you just have to know
these things about me.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.749
I want to play racquetball
in my house.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.918
And-and I'm afraid
I have to demand it.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.887
This is who I am!

Are you done?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.826
Yes.

18:48.828 --> 18:52.363
I was just gonna ask if
you had a second racquet.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.466
Go! Go!
(whoops)

18:56.735 --> 18:57.802
