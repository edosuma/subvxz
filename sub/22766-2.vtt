00:15.671 --> 00:17.014
What's going on?

00:17.039 --> 00:19.503
I put too much damn salt on the rub.

00:19.528 --> 00:21.056
I got to get it out.

00:21.419 --> 00:22.886
Honey, it's 4:30 in the morning.

00:22.911 --> 00:24.543
Yeah, and if the meat loses its juices,

00:24.568 --> 00:26.947
it's gonna be all dry and burnt.

00:28.764 --> 00:30.821
Sweetie, I... I...

00:31.233 --> 00:33.660
I feel like this might be one
of those anxiety attacks

00:33.685 --> 00:35.333
that Dr. Reese said you might have.

00:35.358 --> 00:36.803
It's not because of my condition.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.303
It's because I put too
much damn salt...

00:38.328 --> 00:39.912
Whoa! Okay, okay, okay.

00:48.197 --> 00:49.660
Let me help you.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.937
Why don't you start
measuring out another rub?

01:06.340 --> 01:08.074
Excuse me. Yeah... ah, whoa.

01:08.099 --> 01:09.314
Excuse me.

01:09.339 --> 01:10.747
Okay. Excuse me.

01:10.772 --> 01:11.806
Dr. Rhodes, you're late.

01:11.831 --> 01:13.532
I know. I am sorry.

01:13.557 --> 01:14.786
I understand you're
under additional stress

01:14.811 --> 01:17.050
at home lately, but please try
not to make this a habit.

01:17.075 --> 01:19.101
I assure you I will not.

01:19.458 --> 01:21.159
Dr. Rhodes, your CT patient's here.

01:21.184 --> 01:22.601
You're going to 1.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.597
Jerry Willis, 54, called 911

01:26.622 --> 01:28.250
with shortness of
breath and tachycardia.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.899
BP 110 over 60, rate 120,

01:30.924 --> 01:33.130
satting at 89% on five liters 0-2.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.411
Mr. Willis, what are you
doing back here so soon?

01:35.436 --> 01:36.521
I've been having trouble breathing.

01:36.546 --> 01:38.791
It started a few days after I left.

01:38.816 --> 01:40.549
What trouble are we talking about?

01:40.574 --> 01:43.157
Coughing. He's wheezing.
It's been getting worse.

01:43.182 --> 01:45.497
All right, let's move him on my count.

01:45.864 --> 01:47.290
All right.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.387
And one, two, three.

01:54.825 --> 01:56.939
I replaced his aortic
valve two weeks ago.

01:56.964 --> 01:58.150
Any intraoperative difficulties?

01:58.175 --> 01:59.976
- None.
- Cardiac comorbidities?

02:00.001 --> 02:01.745
Nothing notable, no.

02:02.244 --> 02:04.255
Austin Flint murmur.
The valve is leaking.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.468
That's impossible.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.286
Maybe you're hearing tricuspid stenosis

02:08.311 --> 02:09.883
or a subclinical MI.

02:09.907 --> 02:12.131
Is it possible you
misoriented the valve?

02:12.156 --> 02:14.208
Obstructed one of the leaflets?

02:14.233 --> 02:16.681
No. I remember it very clearly.

02:17.056 --> 02:18.903
Surgery went off without a hitch.

02:26.443 --> 02:28.164
- We should order an echo?
- What?

02:28.189 --> 02:30.423
What's wrong? Aortic insufficiency.

02:30.448 --> 02:32.141
The valve is definitely leaking.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.918
But you just replaced it.
How could it leak?

02:33.943 --> 02:35.572
I don't know. It doesn't
make any sense.

02:35.597 --> 02:36.947
I...

02:38.040 --> 02:39.803
Maybe Dr. Rhodes made a mistake.

02:47.724 --> 02:53.594
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:56.005 --> 02:57.583
- Morning.
- Good morning.

02:57.608 --> 02:58.813
Hi.

02:59.126 --> 03:02.951
Whoa. Is that what you're
planning on wearing tonight?

03:02.976 --> 03:04.883
It's a brand-new Chiara Boni.

03:05.378 --> 03:07.831
I mean... nah, I mean
it's probably fine.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.911
I mean if you think it's fancy enough

03:09.936 --> 03:11.307
for the corner table at Alinea.

03:11.332 --> 03:12.402
Are you kidding?

03:12.427 --> 03:14.681
That's like the toughest
reservation in town.

03:14.706 --> 03:16.571
"GQ" says 97% of relationships

03:16.596 --> 03:17.823
are decided on the first date.

03:17.848 --> 03:20.500
Oh, now you're getting your
dating advice from "GQ"?

03:20.525 --> 03:22.006
Natalie, these are hard numbers.

03:22.031 --> 03:23.766
- Mm.
- I'm just citing the research.

03:27.470 --> 03:29.299
I honestly don't know what happened.

03:29.324 --> 03:31.117
Go back over your notes. Try
to learn from your error.

03:31.142 --> 03:33.202
I will, and I'll get him
preop'd for a re-do.

03:33.284 --> 03:34.804
That will not be necessary.

03:34.829 --> 03:36.746
Between the adhesions and
further procedural stress,

03:36.771 --> 03:38.538
reopening his heart
is simply too risky.

03:38.563 --> 03:40.430
We'll manage him with
medications instead.

03:40.455 --> 03:41.610
But if we don't fix the valve,

03:41.635 --> 03:43.238
his quality of life is gonna suffer.

03:43.263 --> 03:44.808
I understand, but at this point,

03:44.833 --> 03:46.487
it's our best option.

03:51.312 --> 03:52.446
Any plans tonight?

03:52.471 --> 03:54.285
Still got that chili.

03:54.310 --> 03:55.944
- You want to join?
- No way.

03:56.176 --> 03:58.321
Is the sushi place on
the corner still open?

03:58.346 --> 04:00.333
Why can't you just be nice?

04:00.358 --> 04:02.246
Oh, I can be nice.

04:08.402 --> 04:10.142
Hold that thought.

04:18.491 --> 04:21.156
Daniel. You're looking more rested.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.503
Doing my best. What's the word?

04:23.528 --> 04:26.397
The board is deciding whether
to put metal detectors

04:26.422 --> 04:28.066
at all the hospital entrances.

04:28.091 --> 04:30.599
So I have to go prepare
my recommendation.

04:30.624 --> 04:32.146
Which way you leaning?

04:32.179 --> 04:34.113
Toward yes.

04:34.138 --> 04:35.539
Really?

04:35.723 --> 04:37.110
Doesn't that kind of fly in the face

04:37.135 --> 04:40.061
of being a trusted
community institution?

04:40.261 --> 04:42.188
You know, putting up barriers
between us and the people

04:42.213 --> 04:43.847
that we're trying to help?

04:43.872 --> 04:46.840
One of those people shot
you in the gut, Daniel.

04:46.916 --> 04:48.610
Yeah, outside the hospital.

04:48.635 --> 04:50.623
What kind of detector's
gonna stop that?

04:54.496 --> 04:56.519
- Dr. Reese.
- Dr. Charles.

04:59.589 --> 05:01.724
So, Nurse Sexton,

05:01.843 --> 05:04.309
- who do we got next?
- Henry Lee.

05:04.691 --> 05:06.199
He's a sweetheart, comes in every month

05:06.224 --> 05:07.794
for his heart failure meds.

05:10.887 --> 05:13.245
Mr. Lee, I'm Dr. Choi.
How are you doing today?

05:13.270 --> 05:15.832
A lot better now that my girl's here.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.256
She does have that effect on people.

05:18.532 --> 05:20.071
Any new complaints?

05:20.096 --> 05:22.397
Nope. Just got to get my meds.

05:22.422 --> 05:23.832
Take a deep breath.

05:27.057 --> 05:28.534
One more.

05:30.743 --> 05:32.601
How much Lasix does he usually get?

05:32.626 --> 05:34.561
- 40 IV.
- That sounds good.

05:34.586 --> 05:36.675
But I'm also hearing some
dullness near your lung base.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.981
I'd like to send you for an X-ray.

05:38.006 --> 05:39.825
Thanks, Doc, but if it's all the same,

05:39.850 --> 05:41.884
I'd rather just get my meds and go.

05:42.326 --> 05:43.793
Mr. Lee, I hear what you're saying,

05:43.818 --> 05:45.151
but I prefer to be thorough.

05:45.176 --> 05:48.521
Nah, let's just stick to the usual.

05:49.195 --> 05:52.788
Hey, can you do the IV
in my left hand today?

05:52.815 --> 05:54.914
I got a good puffy one.

05:56.613 --> 05:59.700
- She never misses.
- You got it.

06:07.645 --> 06:09.016
I really would like that X-ray.

06:09.041 --> 06:10.691
I bet he'd listen to you.

06:10.716 --> 06:12.617
Why? You think there's
something else going on?

06:12.642 --> 06:14.609
I don't know. Probably not,

06:14.634 --> 06:16.134
but it's impossible to say.

06:16.159 --> 06:17.826
Okay, I'll try.

06:17.851 --> 06:19.536
Thank you.

06:20.148 --> 06:22.387
So I've got a 43-year-old
woman who passed out

06:22.412 --> 06:24.243
at a Starbucks from hypoglycemia.

06:24.268 --> 06:26.040
- Mm-hmm.
- Now, that's normal, right?

06:26.065 --> 06:27.866
But then her blood came
back showing insulin

06:27.891 --> 06:29.215
with a high C-peptide count.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.843
So she gave herself too much insulin.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.639
Right, but here's the thing:

06:32.664 --> 06:34.294
she is not diabetic.

06:34.637 --> 06:35.692
Wait... so wait a minute.

06:35.717 --> 06:37.066
She somehow got her hands on insulin,

06:37.091 --> 06:38.612
then injected it into herself?

06:38.637 --> 06:39.741
Why would she do that?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.823
I don't know. That's why I called you.

06:42.186 --> 06:44.259
- Okay, I'll try to find out.
- All right, cool, thank you.

06:44.284 --> 06:45.987
Oh, actually, um...

06:46.854 --> 06:49.102
Okay, so you know how
I've been hounding you

06:49.127 --> 06:50.938
about getting a drink
one night after work?

06:50.963 --> 06:53.591
- I'm familiar with it, yes.
- Okay, well, I promise

06:53.730 --> 06:55.405
it's all going to stop.

06:55.695 --> 06:57.424
Right after you get a
drink with me tonight.

06:57.449 --> 06:58.868
Oh, come on, Noah,
couldn't we just stick

06:58.893 --> 07:00.298
to being colleagues?

07:00.323 --> 07:01.678
Sure.

07:01.948 --> 07:03.872
A drink as colleagues.

07:04.477 --> 07:05.940
Okay.

07:08.159 --> 07:11.618
Ms. Lake, I'm Dr. Reese
from Psychiatry.

07:11.843 --> 07:13.972
Of course you are.

07:14.426 --> 07:17.083
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:17.373 --> 07:19.486
I understand that you may
have injected yourself

07:19.511 --> 07:20.878
with insulin today.

07:20.903 --> 07:22.427
I did.

07:22.531 --> 07:24.189
Can you tell me why?

07:26.184 --> 07:28.070
Today's the court hearing.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.945
For my divorce.

07:30.258 --> 07:31.498
Oh.

07:31.523 --> 07:32.968
It just snuck up on me.

07:33.515 --> 07:35.549
I mean, I've been dreading
it for months, but

07:35.574 --> 07:38.587
when I woke up today and
realized that this is it...

07:38.694 --> 07:40.662
Did you try to harm yourself?

07:40.687 --> 07:42.389
Oh, no, no, no.

07:42.414 --> 07:44.220
I don't want to die.

07:45.045 --> 07:46.828
I just couldn't face the day.

07:46.853 --> 07:48.687
So let me understand.

07:48.712 --> 07:51.696
You made yourself pass out on purpose?

07:51.721 --> 07:53.316
I panicked.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.256
I did something stupid.

07:55.597 --> 07:57.625
And now I'm wasting your time.

07:57.650 --> 07:59.491
I'm sorry.

07:59.791 --> 08:02.489
Speaking of which, could you
write a note for the judge?

08:02.514 --> 08:04.775
Just something saying I
had a medical emergency.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.355
Ah, I am sorry, but I can't do that.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.859
It doesn't have to be anything big.

08:08.884 --> 08:10.751
Handwritten on a letterhead is fine.

08:10.776 --> 08:13.072
The thing is, you didn't
have an emergency.

08:13.097 --> 08:14.383
You caused it.

08:14.408 --> 08:17.525
So it would be disingenuous
for me to say otherwise.

08:19.703 --> 08:21.552
I'd like to speak with your supervisor.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.775
Excuse me?

08:23.800 --> 08:26.623
I'm seeing a doctor, now
I need a doctor's note.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.360
And if you can't do that,
then get me your supervisor.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.811
Um. Okay.

08:45.428 --> 08:47.195
You look like you need
this more than I do.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.792
I'm fine.

08:48.850 --> 08:50.150
Sure.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.086
Hair's a mess, bags under your eyes.

08:52.111 --> 08:53.641
You look great.

08:55.899 --> 08:58.117
Don't be so hard on yourself.

08:58.365 --> 09:00.674
You work our schedule then go home

09:00.760 --> 09:03.652
to a girlfriend who's
basically your patient too.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.219
Something like this
was bound to happen.

09:07.707 --> 09:09.917
Really? Is that so?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.910
At least it hasn't affected
your sunny disposition.

09:16.452 --> 09:18.169
Keep up the good work.

09:19.823 --> 09:21.816
Dr. Halstead,

09:21.841 --> 09:23.465
You're going to 3. Doris.

09:23.490 --> 09:24.652
Talk to me, Chout.

09:24.677 --> 09:26.881
Julie Dutra, 34, pregnant,

09:26.906 --> 09:29.871
para one gravita zero,
fainted in a yoga class,

09:29.896 --> 09:32.525
in A-fib at 150, BP 90 over 60.

09:33.032 --> 09:35.718
Hi, Julie, I'm Dr. Manning.
This is Dr. Halstead.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.662
I told them I don't want to be here.

09:37.687 --> 09:38.754
Hopefully this won't take long.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.517
On my count. One, two, three.

09:43.606 --> 09:45.128
Julie. Are you okay?

09:45.153 --> 09:47.803
- I'm fine, just call Mira.
- Our midwife.

09:47.828 --> 09:50.058
I think Julie would be more
comfortable at home with her.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.863
Uh, sir, your wife's in
a dangerous arrhythmia.

09:51.888 --> 09:53.604
We can't let her go until
we get it under control.

09:53.629 --> 09:55.009
Do you have any history
of heart disease?

09:55.034 --> 09:56.590
No, I don't eat red meat, and I keep

09:56.615 --> 09:59.004
a high antioxidant profile
to minimize inflammation.

09:59.029 --> 10:00.564
Okay, good.

10:00.589 --> 10:03.487
Let's get an EKG,
cardiac labs, CBC, CMP,

10:03.512 --> 10:06.941
coags and a U/A, and let's
start 5 of verapamil IV, okay?

10:06.966 --> 10:08.238
No, no medications.

10:08.263 --> 10:10.177
This one's safe for pregnancy.

10:10.202 --> 10:11.869
If we don't control your
arrhythmia it could

10:11.894 --> 10:13.823
- put the baby in danger.
- Is that true?

10:13.848 --> 10:14.567
- Scott.
- What?

10:14.592 --> 10:16.128
We don't want anything bad to happen.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.542
Okay, fine, but then we're leaving.

10:20.567 --> 10:22.168
Thank you. All right.

10:22.202 --> 10:23.324
Let me ask you a few more questions.

10:23.349 --> 10:25.238
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Just a quick fetal

10:25.263 --> 10:26.902
- ultrasound.
- No, get that thing off me.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.781
Acoustic radiation impairs
neurodevelopment.

10:28.806 --> 10:30.582
That's not actually true.

10:31.221 --> 10:32.888
Note that the fetus measures

10:32.913 --> 10:34.463
normal size and weight for five months.

10:34.659 --> 10:36.631
Wait, what did you say?

10:36.990 --> 10:39.771
That this looks like a
normal five-month pregnancy.

10:39.977 --> 10:41.377
Measure it again.

10:41.402 --> 10:42.803
I'm sure of the numbers.

10:42.828 --> 10:44.997
Well, you're wrong. Measure it again.

10:49.502 --> 10:50.721
See?

10:51.173 --> 10:53.376
Totally normal for five months.

10:53.401 --> 10:55.651
Except I'm not five months pregnant.

10:56.286 --> 10:57.929
I'm eight.

11:04.954 --> 11:06.423
Julie's labs.

11:08.332 --> 11:10.336
Anemia, vitamin deficiencies,

11:10.427 --> 11:12.130
all the signs of early kidney failure.

11:12.155 --> 11:13.962
And no family history
of troubled pregnancies

11:13.987 --> 11:15.487
or genetic conditions.

11:15.512 --> 11:17.887
Maybe a malabsorption syndrome?

11:20.138 --> 11:22.389
Ms. Dutra.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.008
Have you ever had any
gastrointestinal issues?

11:25.033 --> 11:26.967
Crohn's, ulcerative colitis?

11:27.002 --> 11:28.595
I used to have leaky gut.

11:28.904 --> 11:31.008
At first we thought
it was just lactose,

11:31.033 --> 11:33.398
but of course it was more
complicated than that.

11:33.423 --> 11:35.642
I see, and were you
seeing someone for this?

11:35.870 --> 11:37.755
My nutritionist.

11:38.525 --> 11:41.329
She got me off lecithin
and phytic acid.

11:41.392 --> 11:42.681
It helped some,

11:42.706 --> 11:45.046
but then once I got pregnant
I had to give up all GMOs

11:45.071 --> 11:47.189
and anything that wasn't
locally sourced, too.

11:47.214 --> 11:48.648
So what do you eat?

11:48.673 --> 11:51.597
Certain strains of
Swiss chard, broccoli.

11:51.622 --> 11:53.541
Sometimes I'll have a
cup of adzuki beans.

11:53.566 --> 11:55.366
But she supplements a lot.

11:55.391 --> 11:57.568
Selenium, coenzyme Q.

11:57.898 --> 12:00.233
You eat three meals a day? More? Less?

12:00.353 --> 12:03.919
I do portion control to
manage the baby's glucose.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.869
700 to 800 calories a day. Why?

12:08.002 --> 12:10.009
We suspect the difficulties
with this pregnancy

12:10.034 --> 12:12.107
are being caused by your diet.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.634
That can't be. I only eat organic.

12:14.659 --> 12:17.230
But you're not getting
enough protein or iron.

12:17.691 --> 12:20.244
And we're seeing the effects
it's having on your baby.

12:20.269 --> 12:22.791
We need to start aggressive
IV nutrition to help it grow

12:22.816 --> 12:24.571
as much as possible before you deliver.

12:24.596 --> 12:25.840
If we admit you to Obstetrics now we...

12:25.865 --> 12:27.245
No.

12:28.774 --> 12:30.915
I understand that you
don't want to be here,

12:30.940 --> 12:31.798
but at this point it is... No.

12:31.823 --> 12:33.838
You're not giving me IV food.

12:33.863 --> 12:36.263
Your baby is severely malnourished.

12:36.288 --> 12:37.345
No, my baby is getting

12:37.370 --> 12:39.235
healthy farm-to-table nutrients.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.319
You're not gonna pump him
full of toxins and chemicals.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.625
- Ms. Dutra...
- I said no.

12:48.813 --> 12:50.766
Your arrhythmia hasn't resolved yet.

12:50.791 --> 12:53.107
We'll be back in a
minute to check on you.

13:00.228 --> 13:02.464
She's starving that baby to death.

13:02.489 --> 13:04.208
We need to talk to Goodwin.

13:06.167 --> 13:08.880
Mr. Lee, we got your
X-ray results back.

13:08.905 --> 13:10.722
Great. So I can get out of here?

13:10.747 --> 13:13.500
Actually, they show bilateral
pleural effusions,

13:13.525 --> 13:14.950
fluid surrounding your lungs.

13:14.975 --> 13:17.455
- Is that bad?
- It's hard to say.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.191
It could just be from
your heart failure.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.051
Either way, it's not making
your breathing any easier.

13:21.137 --> 13:22.680
I'd like to have Radiology remove it

13:22.705 --> 13:23.933
with a needle aspiration.

13:23.958 --> 13:25.925
You want to stick a needle in my lung?

13:25.950 --> 13:28.236
- Yes.
- But I'm breathing fine now.

13:28.261 --> 13:30.556
- I'd rather just go.
- I understand, but doing this

13:30.581 --> 13:32.320
will let you go longer
between treatments.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.179
I think it's a good idea.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.000
Don't you agree?

13:37.497 --> 13:39.419
I don't know. Um...

13:39.466 --> 13:41.397
The effusions are pretty small.

13:41.551 --> 13:44.620
True, but it also wouldn't
hurt to send the fluid

13:44.645 --> 13:46.964
out for analysis, just
to be sure, right?

13:47.304 --> 13:49.014
I suppose.

13:49.201 --> 13:51.716
So, Henry, what do you say?

13:52.825 --> 13:55.154
You really think this is a good idea?

13:57.290 --> 13:58.665
Okay.

13:58.690 --> 14:00.858
We'll get you over there right away.

14:03.272 --> 14:05.173
Are you sure you want
to be this aggressive?

14:05.198 --> 14:07.138
I want to cover all the bases, yeah.

14:07.163 --> 14:08.642
Henry's not a very healthy man.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.900
He doesn't do so well with procedures.

14:10.925 --> 14:13.861
I hear you, but medically, it's
the best course of action.

14:17.326 --> 14:18.696
I don't think it is.

14:18.721 --> 14:21.003
I'm sorry you feel that way.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.196
What you should be sorry
about is thinking

14:23.221 --> 14:24.626
that I would agree with you in there

14:24.651 --> 14:26.218
just because we're sleeping together.

14:26.469 --> 14:27.901
That has nothing to do with it.

14:27.926 --> 14:30.056
I thought you'd agree because
that's my medical opinion.

14:30.081 --> 14:31.906
Well, you were wrong.

14:33.597 --> 14:34.955
The next time you want to put me

14:34.980 --> 14:38.132
on the spot in front of
my patient, think again.

14:40.364 --> 14:41.642
Hey.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.343
April.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.740
You want to feed a patient
against her will.

14:47.765 --> 14:49.864
A pregnant mother who's
killing her baby.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.549
We believe she has something
called orthorexia,

14:51.574 --> 14:53.820
an obsession with healthy
living that has limited

14:53.845 --> 14:56.290
her diet so severely that
it's become dangerous.

14:56.315 --> 14:58.033
And has led to a pathologic distrust

14:58.058 --> 15:00.075
of the entire medical system.
She won't let us do anything.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.392
Well, is she delusional?

15:01.417 --> 15:03.101
Can she make decisions on her own?

15:03.126 --> 15:04.517
No, she's very clear about

15:04.542 --> 15:06.483
what she wants and what
she does not want.

15:06.508 --> 15:08.196
Well, then we can't prove incompetence,

15:08.221 --> 15:10.009
and we can't force her to do anything

15:10.034 --> 15:11.681
to her body she doesn't want.

15:11.706 --> 15:13.288
The law sides with her.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.765
But there are two patients here.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.212
Yeah, one of whom has no control

15:16.237 --> 15:17.830
over what's being done to it.

15:18.096 --> 15:19.754
This is child abuse.

15:19.805 --> 15:22.517
Well, I can convene an
emergency ethics committee.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.695
It's possible they may find grounds

15:24.720 --> 15:26.147
to override her decision.

15:26.172 --> 15:27.895
And in the meantime?

15:27.920 --> 15:31.321
See if you can find a way
to help her trust us.

15:33.896 --> 15:35.897
Dr. Latham. We should do the surgery.

15:35.931 --> 15:37.079
- Dr. Rhodes...
- No, I... I

15:37.104 --> 15:38.371
looked over all my notes.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.668
Okay? Mr. Willis' anatomy is good.

15:40.693 --> 15:42.219
We owe him a chance to get this right.

15:42.244 --> 15:43.823
We owe him our best clinical judgement.

15:43.848 --> 15:45.527
Yes, I was inside of his heart.

15:45.552 --> 15:48.388
He's got more than enough
healthy muscle and vasculature.

15:48.413 --> 15:50.581
I'm telling you he can handle it.

15:54.128 --> 15:55.795
Have you had more than
four hours' sleep

15:55.820 --> 15:57.393
this last several weeks?

15:57.566 --> 15:59.300
I am a cardiothoracic fellow.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.802
Sleep deprivation is part of the job.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.433
I understand that.

16:02.676 --> 16:04.915
But you have a lot on your plate.

16:04.940 --> 16:07.342
Dr. Bekker and I will
take the case from here.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.828
No, Dr. Latham, that's not necessary...

16:10.367 --> 16:12.268
Dr. Rhodes, you have a phone call.

16:12.293 --> 16:13.627
Tell them I'll call them back.

16:13.652 --> 16:15.253
I'm sorry. It's your landlord.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.169
He says it's an emergency.

16:28.977 --> 16:31.243
Excuse me. Hey. Thank you.

16:31.268 --> 16:32.399
Excuse me.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.126
Robin. Robin.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.959
Hey, are you okay?

16:35.984 --> 16:37.685
I forgot the brisket in
the oven when I went

16:37.710 --> 16:40.092
to the store, and then
all the alarms went off.

16:40.117 --> 16:42.396
- I'm just such an idiot.
- Come here, come here.

16:42.421 --> 16:43.834
- Come here.
- Hey, Otis, when are we

16:43.859 --> 16:45.412
gonna get that thing shut down?

16:45.437 --> 16:47.156
- She okay?
- Yeah.

16:47.181 --> 16:48.974
Thank you.

16:52.588 --> 16:55.231
Don't worry. It could
happen to anybody.

16:57.702 --> 16:59.905
Shouldn't be more than a half hour.

17:03.036 --> 17:04.872
I'm sorry you had to deal with that.

17:05.970 --> 17:08.967
- No need to be sorry.
- You know what I mean.

17:08.992 --> 17:10.296
The more time you spend with her,

17:10.320 --> 17:12.589
the less we have to see people
who actually need our help.

17:12.717 --> 17:14.050
I don't know.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.630
I'm not quite sure we're...

17:15.655 --> 17:17.382
We're done with Ms. Lake yet.

17:17.512 --> 17:20.094
Why? She just wants to use
us to game the system.

17:20.351 --> 17:22.207
Well, so do a lot of patients.

17:22.406 --> 17:23.808
We're not gonna let her.

17:23.905 --> 17:26.540
But the question is,
why is she doing it?

17:26.565 --> 17:29.147
Wait, you still think
this is a psych case?

17:29.172 --> 17:30.382
Why wouldn't I?

17:30.407 --> 17:32.234
I mean, she exhibited some
pretty extreme behavior

17:32.259 --> 17:34.499
- this morning, didn't she?
- To get out of a court date.

17:34.524 --> 17:35.975
Well, perhaps, but until we figure out

17:36.000 --> 17:37.679
what's behind the behavior,

17:37.704 --> 17:39.757
we haven't really done
our job, have we?

17:40.770 --> 17:42.925
- I guess.
- Good.

17:43.444 --> 17:44.969
Keep me in the loop.

17:57.290 --> 17:59.950
Your heart isn't
responding to the meds.

18:00.974 --> 18:02.774
If things keep going in this direction,

18:02.809 --> 18:04.993
we may need to consider
an emergency C-section

18:05.018 --> 18:06.788
to take the extra load off your heart.

18:06.813 --> 18:09.362
Drug me up then cut me open? No way.

18:09.387 --> 18:10.712
That's not what we want either,

18:10.737 --> 18:12.849
but we do need to protect
you and your baby.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.634
That's why in the meantime,
if you allow us to give you

18:14.659 --> 18:16.642
- some IV nutrition...
- No way.

18:17.042 --> 18:19.831
Those bags off-gas BPAs.

18:20.327 --> 18:22.405
Look, you don't get it.

18:22.456 --> 18:25.366
This baby is being formed
from every single molecule

18:25.391 --> 18:26.791
that enters my body.

18:26.961 --> 18:29.683
It is my job to keep
it absolutely pure.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.378
That is how I'm protecting it.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.359
- They understand that.
- No, they don't.

18:33.486 --> 18:35.412
Uh, excuse us.

18:40.824 --> 18:42.691
Please tell me you have some good news.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.186
I'm afraid not.

18:44.211 --> 18:46.462
The committee ruled
that we can't intervene

18:46.487 --> 18:49.248
against her wishes, not even
for the sake of the baby.

18:49.555 --> 18:50.777
So that's it?

18:50.802 --> 18:52.660
We just have to watch as
she lets the baby die?

18:52.723 --> 18:55.486
If that's what she chooses to do.

18:55.511 --> 18:56.954
But that's not what she wants.

18:56.978 --> 18:58.345
She wants to help her baby.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.014
She's just confused about how to do it.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.433
I'm sorry. Our hands are tied.

19:10.921 --> 19:12.291
What happened?

19:12.316 --> 19:14.648
Satts are at 78 and dropping.

19:17.745 --> 19:19.241
He's in pulmonary edema.

19:19.266 --> 19:21.026
Get him on BiPAP and 40 of Lasix.

19:21.051 --> 19:23.022
He's my patient.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.986
Sublingual nitro, IV nitroprusside

19:27.011 --> 19:28.501
and ready an intra-aortic balloon pump.

19:28.526 --> 19:30.368
- What's happening?
- The leak in your valve

19:30.393 --> 19:32.821
is causing fluid to back
up into your lungs.

19:33.264 --> 19:35.000
BiPAP's at 100%. Balloon pump is here.

19:35.025 --> 19:36.453
What's that?

19:36.478 --> 19:38.581
It's a pump that we
can implant directly

19:38.606 --> 19:41.060
into his aorta to take the
strain off of his heart.

19:41.085 --> 19:43.780
Meds are in. Still satting at 78.

19:44.190 --> 19:47.532
So, then he's hooked up
to a machine forever?

19:47.557 --> 19:49.950
Possibly if his heart doesn't
respond to the medications.

19:49.975 --> 19:51.093
- Oh, my God.
- Betadine.

19:51.118 --> 19:52.235
- Hold on.
- Dr. Rhodes...

19:52.260 --> 19:53.289
Give the meds a minute to work.

19:53.314 --> 19:54.663
We may not have a minute.

19:54.899 --> 19:56.399
Look.

19:58.369 --> 20:00.069
Your sats are coming up.

20:00.094 --> 20:01.853
We'll hold off for now.

20:02.398 --> 20:05.720
Give him 1.25 of enalapril
IV and another 40 of Lasix.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.137
Mr. Dutra. Hi.

20:13.162 --> 20:14.696
I need you to talk to your wife.

20:14.730 --> 20:16.086
She won't listen to me.

20:16.393 --> 20:18.959
But you do understand this
has gotten out of hand.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.271
Of course I do.

20:20.296 --> 20:21.945
I mean, all she thinks about is how

20:21.970 --> 20:23.741
uric acid and compromised soil

20:23.766 --> 20:25.282
are infecting everything we eat.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.774
What do I say to that?

20:26.799 --> 20:28.433
Well, how did you
handle it in the past?

20:28.458 --> 20:29.783
It wasn't this bad before.

20:29.808 --> 20:31.094
I mean, she's always struggled

20:31.119 --> 20:32.920
with anxiety and control issues.

20:32.945 --> 20:34.222
Even when she got pregnant,

20:34.247 --> 20:36.240
it's like she turned the
dial straight to 11.

20:36.275 --> 20:37.975
Nothing's pure enough anymore.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.785
Everything looks like baby poison.

20:39.810 --> 20:41.561
But there has to be
something you can say

20:41.586 --> 20:43.306
to get her to let us help.

20:43.331 --> 20:46.035
I am so scared my wife and
my baby are gonna die.

20:46.442 --> 20:48.335
Can't you do something?

20:50.662 --> 20:54.100
So you think I avoid
conflict to protect myself?

20:54.476 --> 20:56.510
I think it is a possibility.

20:56.535 --> 20:58.328
And you think that's a pattern.

20:58.353 --> 21:01.642
Yes, a destructive one
from the sounds of it.

21:05.376 --> 21:07.450
I can't believe I didn't see it.

21:16.689 --> 21:19.163
I will get your discharge
paperwork started.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.393
Looks like you had a
little breakthrough.

21:30.112 --> 21:33.806
I... I think she sees
that she has some issues

21:33.831 --> 21:34.985
and that it will be worthwhile

21:35.010 --> 21:37.126
for her to seek some long-term therapy.

21:37.253 --> 21:38.887
Sounds like a good start.

21:41.699 --> 21:44.751
I, um... I was wrong about her, Dr.
Charles.

21:44.776 --> 21:46.640
Thank you for making me stick with her.

21:51.371 --> 21:53.008
Dr. Choi.

21:53.033 --> 21:55.010
Pulse ox is down to 82.

22:00.717 --> 22:01.746
No breath sounds on the left.

22:01.770 --> 22:02.536
He's got pneumothorax.

22:02.561 --> 22:04.482
Get a chest tube, 26 French.

22:04.847 --> 22:06.483
I can't breathe.

22:06.711 --> 22:08.097
I'm afraid your lung's collapsed.

22:08.122 --> 22:09.801
Radiology must've nicked
it during the tap.

22:09.826 --> 22:10.731
You're kidding me.

22:10.756 --> 22:12.603
I'm so sorry, Henry.

22:12.869 --> 22:14.719
I need to insert a
tube between your ribs

22:14.744 --> 22:16.005
to reinflate your lung.

22:16.675 --> 22:18.736
Do you understand, Mr. Lee?

22:18.761 --> 22:20.214
Lidocaine.

22:20.585 --> 22:22.783
Henry, I'm just gonna lift your arm.

22:23.523 --> 22:24.957
You're gonna feel a sting.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.581
Just breathe.

22:30.079 --> 22:31.847
It's okay. We're gonna
get you through this.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.423
All I wanted was my damn medicine.

22:34.448 --> 22:35.989
I know.

22:36.383 --> 22:38.443
Then why'd you let him do this to me?

22:38.468 --> 22:39.756
I was fine.

22:45.774 --> 22:46.843
Oh, God.

22:46.868 --> 22:49.813
It feels like your
stabbing me with a knife.

22:49.838 --> 22:51.549
Breathe.

22:56.128 --> 22:58.096
Put him on suction, get
a portable chest X-ray,

22:58.121 --> 22:59.799
gram of cefazolin, a
milligram of morphine

22:59.824 --> 23:01.467
and dress it with xeroform.

23:01.694 --> 23:03.977
At this point I'm gonna
have to admit you, Mr. Lee.

23:04.002 --> 23:07.246
Probably for several days.
I'm very sorry.

23:07.676 --> 23:09.656
I'll check back on him soon.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.495
I'm sorry.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.259
What the hell are you trying to do me?

23:16.284 --> 23:17.733
Please, Ms. Dutra, let me explai...

23:17.758 --> 23:19.329
- I told you no food!
- Just one second.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.604
- What's going on?
- I need you to calm down,

23:20.629 --> 23:22.112
- okay? Please.
- She put this in my IV

23:22.137 --> 23:23.542
- behind my back.
- Ms. Dutra, wait.

23:23.567 --> 23:24.846
Glucose, amino acids.

23:24.887 --> 23:25.815
You did this?

23:25.840 --> 23:27.464
- Ms. Dutra.
- Julie.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.690
- Ms. Dutra, just relax.
- Julie!

23:29.715 --> 23:31.870
Ms. Dutra, we need to
get you back into bed.

23:31.895 --> 23:33.033
Get her away from me.

23:33.058 --> 23:35.351
Get her away from me!

23:35.376 --> 23:36.847
I need some help here.

23:36.872 --> 23:38.674
All right, easy.

23:38.699 --> 23:40.629
Relax, I have her.

23:41.203 --> 23:43.563
Let's get her back up.

23:48.770 --> 23:50.385
Dr. Reese.

23:50.509 --> 23:53.283
Your patient in 1's waiting
for his prescription.

23:53.308 --> 23:54.853
Okay.

23:55.946 --> 23:57.446
Hey, have you seen my pad?

23:57.471 --> 23:58.923
Uh-uh.

23:59.815 --> 24:01.215
Huh.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.192
Have you seen my prescription pad?

24:03.434 --> 24:05.150
- No.
- No?

24:05.175 --> 24:06.386
I couldn't have lost it.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.865
I always put it back in
my pocket, always...

24:11.875 --> 24:13.876
Hey, do you still need
that note for the judge?

24:13.901 --> 24:16.517
Oh, no, it's fine, my lawyer
actually took care of it.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.657
Oh, good. Could you
please open your purse?

24:18.682 --> 24:20.314
- I'm sorry?
- I can't find

24:20.339 --> 24:22.065
my prescription pad. I
want to check your purse.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.502
I don't know why you
think it'd be in there.

24:23.527 --> 24:25.826
Because you decided to
forge the judge a note

24:25.851 --> 24:27.823
and you took it from my
pocket when you hugged me.

24:27.848 --> 24:29.964
I have no idea

24:29.989 --> 24:31.143
what you're talking about.

24:31.168 --> 24:33.064
Hey! Give me that!

24:33.089 --> 24:34.647
So what's this?

24:34.672 --> 24:37.369
You have no right. You're
gonna pay for this!

24:37.394 --> 24:38.672
- Ma'am!
- I am gonna make you pay!

24:38.697 --> 24:41.377
- Hey! Hey.
- Ma'am, step away now!

24:41.402 --> 24:44.930
She assaulted me. She...
she put that in my purse.

24:44.955 --> 24:46.369
Okay, everybody calm down.

25:04.197 --> 25:05.776
Dr. Reese.

25:06.237 --> 25:07.870
What happened in there?

25:07.895 --> 25:09.809
She stole my pad.

25:10.199 --> 25:11.851
That's a felony.

25:12.966 --> 25:15.322
She has been lying to
us from the start.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.702
Of course she has.

25:16.727 --> 25:18.695
Lying, manipulating.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.937
Behaving recklessly with no
regard for herself or others.

25:21.962 --> 25:23.863
- Exactly.
- No.

25:23.888 --> 25:25.987
Not exactly.

25:26.012 --> 25:28.067
Look, off the top of my head,

25:28.222 --> 25:29.822
probably a sociopath,

25:29.847 --> 25:32.359
but that makes your job exploring that

25:32.384 --> 25:33.806
and trying to help her.

25:33.934 --> 25:35.387
Not punishing her.

25:35.412 --> 25:37.213
But all she did from the
moment she got here

25:37.238 --> 25:40.302
was try to manipulate
us and waste our time.

25:40.327 --> 25:42.007
Because she's mentally ill.

25:42.032 --> 25:44.667
No. No, it's because
people like you let her.

25:45.932 --> 25:47.461
- People like me?
- Yes.

25:47.486 --> 25:49.693
Yes, you enable and you make excuses

25:49.718 --> 25:51.642
and you give out psychiatric diagnoses

25:51.667 --> 25:54.806
so that no one has to be held
accountable for their actions

25:54.831 --> 25:57.042
just like you did with
the guy that shot you.

26:08.188 --> 26:09.917
You feeling any better?

26:10.334 --> 26:11.904
A little bit.

26:12.729 --> 26:14.319
Good.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.254
If there's anything that you need,

26:19.001 --> 26:22.299
Dr. Latham and Dr. Bekker are
gonna be taking care of you

26:22.324 --> 26:23.972
from here on out, okay?

26:25.059 --> 26:26.675
Dr. Rhodes.

26:27.146 --> 26:29.567
Am I gonna be like this forever?

26:30.525 --> 26:32.979
Things will get better once
they optimize your meds.

26:33.686 --> 26:37.248
But I'll always be coming back
here for something, right?

26:43.741 --> 26:46.177
There's no way to go back to how I was?

26:47.196 --> 26:50.150
It is possible to redo
your valve surgery.

26:50.175 --> 26:53.745
It comes with significant risks.

26:54.390 --> 26:57.218
You could end up with an
even worse leak than before.

26:57.832 --> 26:59.662
You could even die.

27:00.230 --> 27:02.200
But it could work.

27:02.778 --> 27:04.500
I could go back to normal?

27:07.736 --> 27:10.899
Dr. Latham is the best
this hospital's got.

27:12.685 --> 27:14.642
I promise he's gonna
take great care of you.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.243
This is why I didn't want
to do the lung test.

27:40.268 --> 27:42.039
- Still the right call.
- No, you don't know that.

27:42.064 --> 27:43.189
- You don't know him...
- But I know

27:43.214 --> 27:44.572
what heart failure looks
like, and this just

27:44.597 --> 27:46.212
- seems like something else.
- I've been treating

27:46.237 --> 27:48.529
Henry for years. This
is what he looks like.

27:48.554 --> 27:50.558
I'm not asking for a second opinion.

27:50.779 --> 27:52.489
You don't want my opinion.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.802
Just because I don't
have an MD after my name

27:54.827 --> 27:56.795
doesn't mean I don't know
what's best for my patient.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.921
April, as the doctor, I'm responsible.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.981
I have to do what I think is right.

28:01.006 --> 28:03.718
Both of you, in there. Now.

28:09.103 --> 28:11.275
This has to stop.

28:12.806 --> 28:14.418
Do you need another nurse
on your case, Dr. Choi?

28:14.443 --> 28:15.768
- No.
- Uh, excuse me.

28:15.793 --> 28:17.280
Why didn't you ask me
if I need a new doctor?

28:17.305 --> 28:18.606
- April.
- He's just as much

28:18.631 --> 28:20.483
my patient as he is Dr. Choi's.

28:20.759 --> 28:22.861
I don't know what's going
on between the two of you,

28:22.886 --> 28:25.101
but if you don't stop
disturbing my E.D.,

28:25.126 --> 28:26.976
I'm gonna separate you for good.

28:30.146 --> 28:31.503
Do you understand?

28:31.528 --> 28:32.928
Clear.

28:33.110 --> 28:34.578
Good.

28:38.603 --> 28:40.404
Carry on.

28:51.635 --> 28:53.617
You're very lucky her
husband convinced her

28:53.642 --> 28:56.815
not to pursue action against
you or the hospital.

28:56.957 --> 28:59.613
Ms. Goodwin, I'm sorry.

29:00.384 --> 29:03.586
I expect better from you, Dr. Manning.

29:09.074 --> 29:10.698
Nat, wait.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.243
Hi.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.807
I'm sorry.

29:20.832 --> 29:22.499
I'm really not interested.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.257
I understand.

29:24.628 --> 29:25.983
You didn't trust us before.

29:26.008 --> 29:28.653
You certainly have no
reason to trust us now.

29:29.241 --> 29:31.559
Then we finally agree on something.

29:34.892 --> 29:36.411
Julie.

29:36.938 --> 29:39.006
Fearing for your baby's safety

29:39.103 --> 29:41.705
is the most natural thing in the world.

29:44.191 --> 29:45.821
When I was pregnant,

29:46.482 --> 29:48.317
I lost my husband.

29:49.725 --> 29:51.913
I was afraid of a lot of things.

29:53.157 --> 29:56.313
And then one day, after I had my son,

29:56.640 --> 29:59.534
I was up in a high-rise
building on the balcony

29:59.941 --> 30:03.663
and suddenly had this
vivid image of myself

30:03.688 --> 30:05.549
falling over the railing.

30:06.233 --> 30:09.712
And my first thought was,
what would happen to my son

30:09.737 --> 30:11.834
if I wasn't here for him?

30:12.747 --> 30:14.971
And the craziest part is, my
favorite thing in the world

30:14.996 --> 30:17.689
had always been Ferris
wheels and roller coasters

30:17.714 --> 30:19.573
and being up in the air.

30:19.598 --> 30:21.689
But from that day on,

30:21.714 --> 30:25.168
I had this totally
irrational fear of heights.

30:26.355 --> 30:30.010
It is really scary being
solely responsible

30:30.035 --> 30:33.604
for that tiny, defenseless
person inside of you.

30:34.193 --> 30:36.448
But you are letting your fear win.

30:37.006 --> 30:38.975
And it's gonna end badly.

30:42.356 --> 30:43.751
Anyway...

30:46.024 --> 30:47.413
I am sorry.

31:07.842 --> 31:10.669
I just got the analysis
of Henry's lung tap.

31:17.856 --> 31:20.306
Non-small-cell lung cancer?

31:24.487 --> 31:26.400
You were right to do the tap.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.837
That's not important.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.788
What matters now is that
he needs to be told,

31:33.813 --> 31:36.815
and I think it would be best
if he hears it from you.

31:39.150 --> 31:42.037
You've treated him
longer than anyone here.

31:43.452 --> 31:46.054
You know him better than anyone here.

32:16.992 --> 32:19.193
Why is Mr. Willis insisting on surgery?

32:19.228 --> 32:20.728
Despite my explicit recommendations

32:20.763 --> 32:22.163
- to the contrary?
- Dr. Latham, I...

32:22.197 --> 32:23.679
Did you go behind my back?

32:23.704 --> 32:25.438
No, he asked if he had options.

32:25.463 --> 32:27.722
So I told him. I, in
no way, suggested...

32:30.350 --> 32:33.438
You've shown extremely poor
decision-making today.

32:34.219 --> 32:36.272
From this point on, you are
not to step foot in the O.R.

32:36.297 --> 32:37.805
until I deem you ready to return.

32:37.829 --> 32:39.766
- Do you understand?
- You're benching me?

32:39.792 --> 32:42.193
For the foreseeable future. Yes.

32:48.950 --> 32:50.685
Dr. Halstead.

32:53.892 --> 32:56.060
Her heart rate's too high and
her pressure's dropping.

32:56.085 --> 32:57.352
Baby's heart rate's down to 90.

32:57.377 --> 32:58.991
My chest hurts.

32:59.016 --> 33:01.158
Your arrhythmia is
escalating out of control.

33:01.183 --> 33:02.530
Push 10 milligrams of diltiazem stat

33:02.555 --> 33:04.252
and up her 0-2 to 6 liters.

33:04.277 --> 33:05.919
We need to do a C-section.
We have to get the baby out.

33:05.944 --> 33:07.236
No.

33:07.261 --> 33:09.062
Julie, I know you don't trust me,

33:09.087 --> 33:10.545
but your baby is in real danger.

33:10.570 --> 33:12.487
- 84.
- Julie, let them do it.

33:12.512 --> 33:14.107
I can't.

33:14.132 --> 33:15.900
Julie, if you don't let us do this,

33:15.925 --> 33:18.060
your baby is going to die.

33:21.572 --> 33:23.621
- Okay, do it.
- Thank you.

33:24.157 --> 33:25.577
Call O.B. and tell them we're coming up

33:25.602 --> 33:27.151
for a crash C-section, now!

33:27.176 --> 33:28.810
You heard her. Let's move.

33:35.999 --> 33:38.290
I'm not seeing any cause for the leak.

33:38.315 --> 33:40.199
- Pickups.
- Pickups.

33:40.909 --> 33:43.124
Are any of the leaflets
impinged in the ventricle?

33:43.149 --> 33:47.294
No, they're opening freely, and
the orientation is correct.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.561
- So what do we do?
- Re-suture the valve.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.880
Won't give us much room to work,

33:52.905 --> 33:55.247
but I don't see where we have a choice.

33:56.930 --> 33:58.610
It's the valve.

34:00.083 --> 34:01.526
It's the valve.

34:01.551 --> 34:04.003
Dr. Rhodes, no one asked
for your opinion.

34:06.556 --> 34:08.565
It's a brand-new valve.
That's ridiculous.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.524
The leaflets must be asymmetrical.

34:10.714 --> 34:12.498
That would cause a large
enough opening for the blood

34:12.523 --> 34:14.572
to keep leaking back through.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.884
It does seem that they're
not closing properly.

34:20.286 --> 34:22.489
Really? They gave us a bad valve?

34:22.829 --> 34:24.779
It appears so.

34:25.091 --> 34:26.998
Dr. Rhodes, go change your clothes.

34:27.024 --> 34:30.080
I'd like you to scrub in for
the remainder of the surgery.

34:44.003 --> 34:46.830
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.

34:48.237 --> 34:50.205
What are they putting in him?

34:51.534 --> 34:54.504
Proteins, carbohydrates, fats.

34:54.764 --> 34:56.795
He needs them to grow.

35:06.789 --> 35:08.390
You paged about a consult?

35:08.415 --> 35:10.671
Yeah. Yeah.

35:10.820 --> 35:12.424
Um...

35:12.449 --> 35:16.883
50-something guy, post-op after
getting shot by a patient.

35:18.144 --> 35:19.769
Is this a joke?

35:20.148 --> 35:22.282
No. I'm serious.

35:22.307 --> 35:25.876
Give me your clinical
evaluation of my recovery.

35:28.442 --> 35:31.266
No residual anger or fear.

35:32.573 --> 35:33.748
Mm-hmm.

35:33.773 --> 35:36.061
Normal intellectual and
emotional functioning.

35:36.086 --> 35:38.842
You seem like you have moved on.

35:39.463 --> 35:40.847
Yeah.

35:41.326 --> 35:43.084
And you should too.

35:44.083 --> 35:45.917
Excuse me?

35:47.060 --> 35:50.032
I'm just wondering if today
was less about your patient

35:50.207 --> 35:52.910
and more about lingering
fears for our safety.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.777
It is certainly true

35:55.021 --> 35:57.603
that a very few patients
can be dangerous.

35:57.628 --> 36:00.605
But the overwhelming majority are...

36:00.976 --> 36:05.144
harmless and in fact very
grateful for our help.

36:05.678 --> 36:08.388
Only they can't get that help
if you come to work scared.

36:09.283 --> 36:10.760
I'm not scared.

36:10.785 --> 36:12.265
This is not an accusation, Doctor.

36:12.290 --> 36:14.652
I just want you to know
that every psychiatrist

36:14.677 --> 36:17.182
goes through this at
some point or another.

36:17.656 --> 36:19.184
And then it passes.

36:19.708 --> 36:21.463
And it'll pass for you, too.

36:39.525 --> 36:41.895
Seems the hospital changed
valve manufacturers

36:41.920 --> 36:43.220
several weeks ago.

36:43.356 --> 36:44.866
This particular company didn't bother

36:44.891 --> 36:46.873
to conduct any human testing.

36:47.787 --> 36:49.367
And they can do that?

36:49.421 --> 36:50.671
All they have to do is prove

36:50.696 --> 36:53.705
that it performs the same
function as a previous device.

36:56.025 --> 36:57.609
Unbelievable.

37:00.104 --> 37:01.764
Well...

37:03.211 --> 37:04.945
Good night, Dr. Latham.

37:07.120 --> 37:11.688
When surgeons burn out, it
always starts with stress.

37:13.793 --> 37:16.954
Then a call goes the wrong
way, an unlucky result.

37:17.450 --> 37:18.913
And they get in their own heads,

37:18.938 --> 37:21.240
and that's when the hesitation starts,

37:21.265 --> 37:23.536
the unsteady hands.

37:24.679 --> 37:26.361
And once you're there,

37:26.742 --> 37:29.123
it's a very hard road back.

37:32.741 --> 37:34.770
Are you okay, Dr. Rhodes?

37:36.531 --> 37:39.178
Yes. I am.

37:41.027 --> 37:43.487
Then you continue to
have my full confidence.

37:44.439 --> 37:46.240
Good night.

37:46.274 --> 37:47.975
Good night.

37:57.952 --> 37:59.620
I'm sorry.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.719
Me too.

38:05.693 --> 38:08.059
This isn't gonna be easy, is it?

38:09.295 --> 38:11.045
No, it's not.

38:13.163 --> 38:15.275
Though, you know what would help?

38:16.158 --> 38:17.804
- Big pot of chili.
- Sushi?

38:20.777 --> 38:23.429
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

38:28.322 --> 38:29.876
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:30.102 --> 38:32.403
How'd that metal
detector thing turn out?

38:32.461 --> 38:34.194
I changed my mind.

38:34.455 --> 38:35.951
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:35.976 --> 38:38.975
I saw a woman today who
almost killed her baby

38:39.239 --> 38:41.066
because she didn't trust us.

38:41.091 --> 38:42.662
And I thought,

38:42.687 --> 38:45.897
"How can we encourage
people to trust us more

38:45.922 --> 38:48.990
if we don't show them trust first?"

38:49.604 --> 38:51.405
Couldn't agree more.

38:56.419 --> 39:00.690
- Well, uh, good night.
- All right, see you tomorrow.

39:09.497 --> 39:11.279
Dr. Reese, Dr. Sexton.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.442
Check it out.

39:13.696 --> 39:15.608
Someone slashed her tires.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.097
You still think patients are harmless?

39:20.122 --> 39:22.138
She did this.

39:23.331 --> 39:25.218
Yes, I'm still here.

39:30.380 --> 39:32.247
I'm sorry you don't
even get a real meal

39:32.272 --> 39:34.594
after the day you have had.

39:34.619 --> 39:38.266
Oh, a little vegetarian
living never hurt anybody.

39:39.662 --> 39:42.753
Well, I'm sorry that you
have to put up with...

39:43.322 --> 39:45.010
all of this.

39:45.835 --> 39:49.241
I promise it will be better soon.

39:50.112 --> 39:51.959
I know.

40:13.319 --> 40:14.634
It's almost 9:00.

40:14.659 --> 40:16.305
Aren't we gonna miss our reservation?

40:16.330 --> 40:17.784
Maybe.

40:17.809 --> 40:20.278
So then what are we doing here?

40:22.093 --> 40:23.600
What?

40:23.625 --> 40:26.241
No. No, no, no. No way. Mm-mm.

40:26.266 --> 40:28.534
Hey, you're not gonna
let fear win, are you?

40:28.559 --> 40:30.154
Uh, yes. Yes, I am.

40:30.179 --> 40:31.252
Aw, come on.

40:31.277 --> 40:32.818
Just one ride.

40:32.843 --> 40:35.547
Oh, Will, no.

40:36.102 --> 40:39.972
Natalie, I'm gonna be next
to you the whole time.

40:41.878 --> 40:43.305
Trust me.
