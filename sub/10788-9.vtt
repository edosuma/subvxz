WELL, THAT SEALS IT.

00:07.667 --> 00:10.667
I HAVE NOW OFFICIALLY
LOST FAITH IN HOLLYWOOD.

00:10.667 --> 00:12.250
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.041
NOT THAT BAD?
MAYBE THROUGH THE HAZE

00:14.041 --> 00:15.166
OF YOUR EARDRUM-SHATTERING
SLUMBER, IT WASN'T THAT BAD,

00:15.166 --> 00:18.083
BUT AS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY
WATCHED THAT MOVIE,

00:18.083 --> 00:19.333
IT SUCKED!

00:19.333 --> 00:21.375

OF THIS TREND OF...

00:21.375 --> 00:23.500

OF THE "INSERT
YOUR VENGEFUL

00:23.500 --> 00:24.583
PSYCHO HERE" MOVIE.

00:24.583 --> 00:27.000

SO UNBELIEVABLE,

00:27.000 --> 00:28.166
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

00:28.166 --> 00:29.500

00:33.959 --> 00:35.166
WELL, APPARENTLY
THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD

WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?

00:38.083 --> 00:39.208
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.500
YOU TALK IN YOUR SLEEP,

00:40.500 --> 00:41.333
AND YOU TALK ABOUT THINGS
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.375
THAT'S GREAT,
BUT THE PROBLEM IS

00:43.375 --> 00:45.417
THAT PEOPLE FORGET
THAT THE SCARIEST THINGS

00:45.417 --> 00:47.166
ARE THE THINGS
THAT ARE ACTUALLY POSSIBLE.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.708
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT
WHY HITCHCOCK'S SO GREAT?

00:48.708 --> 00:51.291
HMM, I DON'T KNOW.

00:51.291 --> 00:52.625
HOW OFTEN
DOES A GUY GO AROUND

00:52.625 --> 00:54.208
DRESSING LIKE
HIS NOT-SO-WELL
PRESERVED MOTHER?

00:54.208 --> 00:56.208
WELL, YOU SAVE THAT
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.041
EXCUSE ME?

28:43.041 --> 28:44.291
COME ON, I MEAN,

28:44.291 --> 28:45.917
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE GAY OR ANYTHING.

28:45.917 --> 28:46.875
[LAUGHS]

28:46.875 --> 28:49.750
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
HE'S CHARISMATIC,

28:49.750 --> 28:51.708
CHARMING, CUTE.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.250
I LOOK UP
TO THE GUY.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.708
THAT'S IT, OK?

28:54.708 --> 28:56.291
IF YOU SAY SO.

28:57.291 --> 28:59.333
LOOK, BRECHER
IS THE ONLY GUY

28:59.333 --> 29:01.500
WHO'S EVER
MADE ME FEEL LIKE
I'M GOOD AT ANYTHING,

29:01.500 --> 29:03.458
AND HE'S THE ONLY PERSON
I KNOW WHO DOESN'T
MAKE ME FEEL

29:03.458 --> 29:05.500
LIKE A COMPLETE FREAK
FOR NOT GOING
TO COLLEGE,

29:05.500 --> 29:06.917
AND IF YOU KNEW ANYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE,

29:06.917 --> 29:07.959
WHICH YOU DON'T,

29:07.959 --> 29:10.083
THEN YOU WOULD KNOW
THAT THAT'S DESERVING

29:10.083 --> 29:12.750
OF NO SMALL AMOUNT
OF HERO WORSHIP. OK?

29:21.417 --> 29:22.417
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:22.417 --> 29:25.083
HIS LIGHTS WERE OFF.

29:25.083 --> 29:28.333
I DON'T THINK THAT
WAS SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

29:28.333 --> 29:29.291
THAT'S
THE UNIVERSAL SIGN

29:29.291 --> 29:30.834
FOR "HEY, BUDDY,
YOUR LIGHTS ARE OFF."

29:30.834 --> 29:32.917
IT'S ALSO AN INVITATION
FOR TROUBLE.

29:32.917 --> 29:34.625
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

29:34.625 --> 29:36.125
NO, I HEARD ABOUT THIS.

29:36.125 --> 29:38.125
IT'S LIKE
A GANG INITIATION THING.

29:38.125 --> 29:41.083
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
THEY SEND OUT THEIR
NEW MEMBERS IN A CAR

29:41.083 --> 29:42.417
WITH THE HEADLIGHTS
TURNED OFF,

29:42.417 --> 29:44.375
AND THE FIRST PERSON
WHO FLASHES THEIR LIGHTS
AT THEM,

29:44.375 --> 29:45.542
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO HUNT THEM DOWN AND
RUN THEM OFF THE ROAD.

29:45.542 --> 29:46.583
IT'S A GAME TO THEM.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.750
ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW

29:48.750 --> 29:51.417
WHAT MAD MAX,
POST-APOCALYPTIC
UNIVERSE YOU LIVE IN,

29:51.417 --> 29:53.834
BUT IN MINE,
THAT'S JUST SIMPLE
DRIVER COURTESY.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.125
FINE. I'M MAKING IT UP.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.959
NOW, I DIDN'T SAY THAT
YOU'RE MAKING IT UP.

29:56.959 --> 29:59.458
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
SOME PEOPLE FORGET
TO TURN ON THEIR LIGHTS.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.208
HEY, I HOPE I'M WRONG.

30:02.625 --> 30:03.333
BUT I'M NOT.

30:03.333 --> 30:05.458
U-TURN.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.875
WHAT?
HE'S FOLLOWING US.

30:06.875 --> 30:07.333
OK. NOW YOU'RE
BEING PARANOID.

30:07.333 --> 30:10.375
AM I?

30:19.750 --> 30:22.583
WHAT IS
THIS GUY'S PROBLEM?

30:25.333 --> 30:28.583
GOD, YOU JUST HAD
TO BE THE GOOD SAMARITAN,
DIDN'T YOU?

30:28.583 --> 30:29.750
LOOK, COULD YOU JUST
SAVE THE TUTORIAL

30:29.750 --> 30:31.792
FOR A LITTLE BIT
LATER, PLEASE?

30:33.917 --> 30:35.000
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?!

30:40.625 --> 30:42.291
THERE'S
A TRUCK STOP AHEAD.

30:42.291 --> 30:43.417
WHERE?
RIGHT THERE.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.125
DAMN!

31:04.041 --> 31:05.083
OH, DAMN!

31:07.083 --> 31:09.166
BRECHER
IS GOING
TO KILL ME.

31:09.166 --> 31:11.083
YEAH. I BET HE'S
NOT GOING TO TAKE YOU
TO THE PROM ANYMORE EITHER.

31:11.083 --> 31:14.333
HEH HEH. YOU'RE
GETTIN' FUNNIER
EVERY MINUTE,

31:14.333 --> 31:15.458
LET ME TELL YA.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.417
I CAN'T GET A SIGNAL.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.125
[SIGHS] FINE.

31:38.458 --> 31:40.500
WELL...

31:41.291 --> 31:43.583
WHY IS THIS
NOT SURPRISING?

32:06.208 --> 32:07.750
[CLEARS THROAT]

32:10.041 --> 32:12.041
ARE YOU STANDIN'
OR SITTIN'?

32:12.041 --> 32:14.750
UH, DO YOU MIND
IF WE USE
YOUR TELEPHONE?

32:14.750 --> 32:16.708
IT'S OVER THERE.

32:16.708 --> 32:18.458
NO. THAT ONE'S
OUT OF ORDER.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.917
WELL, THEN I GUESS
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK,
AIN'T YA?

32:20.917 --> 32:22.750
[SIGHS]
LOOK, LADY,
I'M HAVING--

32:22.750 --> 32:23.959
PACEY.
JUST A SECOND.

32:23.959 --> 32:25.333
PACEY, LOOK.
I'M HAVING--
WHAT?!

32:25.333 --> 32:28.000
LOOK.

32:35.583 --> 32:37.125
OK.

32:37.125 --> 32:38.583
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS IT, HUH?

32:43.166 --> 32:47.458
WHICH ONE OF YOU INBRED,
REDNECK FREAKS

32:47.458 --> 32:49.250
SMASHED INTO MY CAR?

32:49.250 --> 32:50.166
HUH? A SHOW OF HANDS.

32:50.166 --> 32:53.375
MAYBE YOU, HUH?
IN THE JEANS SHIRT.

32:59.917 --> 33:01.458
GET OUTTA MY PLACE.

33:01.458 --> 33:05.417
OH, NO, NO.
SOMEONE IN HERE
SMASHED INTO MY CAR.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.458
NOT MY PROBLEM.

33:06.458 --> 33:08.583
OH, IS  YOUR PROBLEM.
IS EVERYBODY'S--

33:08.583 --> 33:10.041
LEAVE!

33:10.041 --> 33:12.625
OH, MY. YOU REALLY
SHOULD THINK ABOUT
SEEING A DENTIST.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.291
YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

33:52.333 --> 33:53.667
OK.

33:53.667 --> 33:55.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:55.667 --> 33:56.208
JUST HOLD ON.

34:27.041 --> 34:27.917
POP THE TRUNK.

34:27.917 --> 34:29.667
HEY. WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

34:29.667 --> 34:32.500
JUST DO IT.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.708
LADY, ARE YOU NUTS?

34:40.708 --> 34:44.041
OHH, I HAVE GOT TO START
MEETING LESS ANGRY WOMEN.

34:56.166 --> 34:57.291
GET OUT OF THE CAR!

35:02.458 --> 35:04.417
OK.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.041
WHAT DO YOU SAY
I DRIVE YOU HOME NOW?

35:28.667 --> 35:30.834
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

35:30.834 --> 35:33.083
THANKS FOR
A LOVELY EVENING.

35:33.083 --> 35:34.333
ANYTIME. LET'S GO.

35:44.625 --> 35:48.333
SO, I GUESS
WHAT WE CAN CONCLUDE
FROM THIS EVENING

35:48.333 --> 35:50.208
IS THAT WE CAN'T
OFFER MUCH MORE
OF A THRILL

35:50.208 --> 35:52.083
THAN THE AVERAGE
SLASHER FLICK.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.500
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT
OUR GENERATION IS TRUE,

35:55.500 --> 35:57.250
HOW WE'VE GROWN UP
IMMUNE TO THE MEDIA.

35:57.250 --> 35:59.417
LOOK AT
REALITY TELEVISION.

35:59.417 --> 36:00.333
SUDDENLY,
IT'S NORMAL TO SEE

36:00.333 --> 36:03.291
PEOPLE GUZZLING BLOOD
ON PRIMETIME.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.750
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO DISTRACT US
WITH THIS JADED PRATTLE

36:05.750 --> 36:08.125
BECAUSE JACK AND I
BOTH KNOW THAT YOU
STILL CHECK UNDER THE BED

36:08.125 --> 36:09.708
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.750
[LAUGHS] HEY, GRAMS.

36:12.750 --> 36:13.458
HELLO.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.333
I TRUST I'M NOT INTERRUPTING
ANY UNSAVORY ACTIVITY HERE.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.417
NOPE. WE'RE AS CLEAN
AS THEY COME, ACTUALLY.

36:21.417 --> 36:24.667
WE'RE JUST LITERALLY
SITTING AROUND THE FIRE

36:24.667 --> 36:25.875
TELLING GHOST STORIES.

36:25.875 --> 36:29.667
OH, WELL, YOU ALL HAVEN'T
HAD ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE

36:29.667 --> 36:31.542
TO TELL
A TRULY CHILLING TALE.

36:32.667 --> 36:35.375
BUT, UH, IF YOU NOVICES
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT,

36:35.375 --> 36:36.667
I THINK I MIGHT
JUST HAVE A GOOD ONE.

36:36.667 --> 36:40.917
UH, YOU'RE GONNA
BE HARD PRESSED
TO SCARE US, GRAMS.

36:40.917 --> 36:43.583
I MEAN,
WE'RE JUST A BUNCH
OF JADED CINEPHILES

36:43.583 --> 36:45.250
THAT DON'T EVEN
FLINCH AT THE SIGHT

36:45.250 --> 36:46.375
OF BLOOD SPLATTERING
ALL OVER THE
PAVEMENT ANYMORE.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.333
THANK YOU FOR THAT
SWEET DREAM IMAGERY, JACK.

36:53.083 --> 36:55.708
Grams: NOW, THEN.

36:55.708 --> 36:58.667
A TRULY SCARY STORY
SHOULD HIT YOU WHERE YOU LIVE,

36:58.667 --> 37:00.875
FIND YOU IN A SAFE PLACE,

37:00.875 --> 37:03.500
AND TURN IT
INTO A DEN OF NIGHTMARES.

37:04.708 --> 37:06.417
OK.

37:06.417 --> 37:07.875
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,
MRS. RYAN,

37:07.875 --> 37:09.708
'CAUSE I'M STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT.

37:09.708 --> 37:11.708
Grams: GOOD.

37:11.708 --> 37:14.375
MY STORY--

37:14.375 --> 37:16.667
ACTUALLY,
IT'S JENNIFER'S STORY--

37:16.667 --> 37:19.458
AN EXPERIENCE THAT
TERRIFIED HER SO DEEPLY,

37:19.458 --> 37:22.417
SHE COULD NEVER BEAR
TO RELIVE THE TALE.

37:23.667 --> 37:26.041
IT HAPPENED THE FIRST NIGHT
SHE WAS ON HER OWN

37:26.041 --> 37:27.125
AT THE RADIO STATION.

37:28.166 --> 37:32.083
SHE WAS ALONE
IN THE BOOTH.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.542
IT WAS GETTING ON
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
OK, PEOPLE. I'M BACK,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.542
AND I'VE BEEN SAVING
ONE LAST SONG FOR YOU.

37:46.708 --> 37:50.542
[SIGHS]

37:50.542 --> 37:52.542
[TAPPING]

37:54.917 --> 37:58.041
[SIGHS] DAMMIT.

38:56.708 --> 38:58.250
OH!

39:07.166 --> 39:08.834
UHH.

39:29.333 --> 39:30.667
SHOOT.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.208
[WHISPERING]
JENNIFER.

39:32.208 --> 39:34.125
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

39:41.708 --> 39:44.458
WHY--WHY ARE YOU
JUST STANDING THERE?

39:48.708 --> 39:50.166
SAY SOMETHING.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.917
[GASPS]

39:59.875 --> 40:01.708
UHH.

40:01.708 --> 40:02.667
OH!

40:18.500 --> 40:20.208
MY APOLOGIES.
A LITTLE SCRATCH
ON THE VINYL THERE, FOLKS.

40:20.208 --> 40:22.750
THIS IS JEN ON WBCW,

40:22.750 --> 40:23.917
KEEPING YOU COMPANY
ALL EVENING.

40:23.917 --> 40:27.166
I'M GONNA
CUT TO COMMERCIAL
AND BE RIGHT BACK.

40:38.500 --> 40:41.083
[WHISPERING]
Jennifer.

40:45.750 --> 40:47.375
AAAAAH!

40:57.917 --> 40:59.125
NOW, THAT...

40:59.125 --> 41:01.917
IS A SCARY STORY.

41:08.625 --> 41:12.000
WELL, YOU CHILDREN
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT NOW, HMM?

41:16.250 --> 41:18.458
OH, I--

41:18.458 --> 41:21.041
I HOPE I DIDN'T GIVE
YOU JADED CINEPHILES

41:21.041 --> 41:21.667
TOO MUCH OF A FRIGHT.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.166
GOOD NIGHT.

41:28.166 --> 41:31.083
SWEET DREAMS.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.291
SO,

41:37.291 --> 41:39.125
I GUESS THIS IS, UH,
TYPICALLY THE TIME
OF NIGHT

41:39.125 --> 41:41.166
THAT WE, YOU KNOW,
GO TO SLEEP.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.166
WELL, HEY,
DON'T LET US STOP YOU.

41:43.166 --> 41:45.500
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE TOO AFRAID

41:45.500 --> 41:47.083
TO GO UPSTAIRS
BY YOURSELF.

41:47.083 --> 41:48.458
[LAUGHS] YEAH.

41:48.458 --> 41:50.166
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE--YOU'RE
TOO SCARED

41:50.166 --> 41:53.083
TO GO TO THAT CREEPY
LITTLE FLOATING HOUSE
OF YOURS.

41:53.083 --> 41:55.208
NO.

41:55.208 --> 41:58.417
WHY WOULD I BE AFRAID?
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

41:58.417 --> 41:59.792
WE WERE JUST GOING.

41:59.792 --> 42:01.333
THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE STILL HERE

42:01.333 --> 42:03.250
IS 'CAUSE I WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN
DAWSON AND JENNY GET BACK,

42:03.250 --> 42:04.708
WE SHOULD ALL GET TOGETHER.
I'LL COOK FOR YOU.

42:04.708 --> 42:05.625
[LAUGHS]
NO, NO, PLEASE.

42:05.625 --> 42:08.708
THAT'S ENOUGH
OF THE FEAR FACTOR.

42:08.708 --> 42:09.834
AH HEH HEH. YEAH.
THAT'S FUNNY.

42:09.834 --> 42:11.875
YOU SEE WHAT YOU
JUST EARNED YOURSELF?

42:11.875 --> 42:12.792
YOU EARNED YOURSELF
CONTAMINATED FOOD.

42:15.625 --> 42:16.333
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, JO?

42:16.333 --> 42:17.834
YOU WANNA BRAVE THE "T"?

42:20.166 --> 42:21.542
YEAH, I'M WILLING
TO VENTURE FORTH
IF YOU ARE.

42:21.542 --> 42:24.875
YEAH, OF COURSE.
SURE, LET'S GO.

42:24.875 --> 42:28.166
BUT YOU ARE  GONNA WALK
IN FRONT OF ME, RIGHT?

42:28.166 --> 42:30.208
WELL, NOW, ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU WANT ME
TO DO THAT?

42:30.208 --> 42:31.667
'CAUSE IF I WALK
IN FRONT OF YOU,

42:31.667 --> 42:33.166
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SEE
THE MAN THAT'S GONNA
JUMP OUT OF THE BUSHES

42:33.166 --> 42:33.834
AND STAB YOU
IN THE THROAT?

42:33.834 --> 42:35.041
PACEY, THERE IS NO MAN.

42:35.041 --> 42:38.083
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
I'M ALL FOR GENDER EQUALITY.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.166
IT COULD BE A WOMAN.

42:39.166 --> 42:42.250
SOME, GREEN-EYED
ANGELINA JOLIE TYPE.

42:42.250 --> 42:44.208
ACTUALLY, THAT COULD
BE PRETTY INTERESTING.

42:44.208 --> 42:46.083
CAN WE JUST GO
BEFORE IT STRIKES MIDNIGHT

42:46.083 --> 42:48.500
AND GRAMS EMERGES
LOOKING FOR HER LOST HEAD?

42:48.500 --> 42:50.542
SEE? I KNEW
THE GRAMS THING
RUNS DEEP.

42:50.542 --> 42:51.458
I KNEW IT.

42:51.458 --> 42:52.583
I TELL YA,
SWEET MRS. RYAN IS NOTHING

42:52.583 --> 42:54.959
COMPARED TO WHAT
WE GOT IN STORE FOR US.

42:54.959 --> 42:57.166
LAUGH ALL YOU WANT, PACE.
BUT YOU ARE  MY ESCORT.

42:57.166 --> 43:00.667
[HEAVY BREATHING]
