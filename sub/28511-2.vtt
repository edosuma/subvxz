Right.

15:37.415 --> 15:40.405
I'm sorry about this, Adam.

15:40.425 --> 15:43.465
I tried to talk her out of it,
but you know what she's like.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.285
(EXHALES)

15:55.345 --> 15:57.435

15:59.435 --> 16:02.395
You're an ungrateful
little prick, you know that?

16:02.415 --> 16:04.435
- Yeah, I know.
- She's got you tied

16:04.455 --> 16:07.405
- by the balls, doesn't she?
- You know, actually,

16:07.425 --> 16:11.355
believe it or not, mate...
I'm doing this for me.

16:13.375 --> 16:16.285
- Call it therapy.
- Who did you talk to, Adam?

16:16.305 --> 16:19.325
- Fuck you.
- I did tell her.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.485
She said you'd talk;
I said, "No way.

16:21.505 --> 16:24.365
Adam's too proud.
He needs motivating."

16:24.385 --> 16:27.345
Hmm. Well, I refer you
to my previous answer.

16:27.365 --> 16:29.365
"My dearest Tina..."

16:29.385 --> 16:32.275
That is the name
of your ex, right?

16:32.295 --> 16:33.485
The one who fucked your
best friend, broke your heart.

16:33.505 --> 16:35.405
The reason
why you came out here.

16:35.425 --> 16:38.285
The one you don't stop
fucking going on about.

16:41.305 --> 16:43.365
"My dearest Tina,

16:43.385 --> 16:45.445
"you know the saddest feeling
in the world?

16:45.465 --> 16:48.305
"When you sit down

16:52.275 --> 16:54.415
"and you've got no one
to say them to.

16:54.435 --> 16:58.265
"I wished I'd known
how hard it was to undo things,

16:58.285 --> 17:00.295
how difficult it is
to fix mistakes."

17:00.315 --> 17:02.335
This actually reads better
than I thought.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.255
"But those mistakes we make,

17:05.275 --> 17:07.345
"we carry them with us

underage girls, the shame,

17:22.425 --> 17:24.454

at himself out here

17:49.335 --> 17:51.365

he doesn't like what he sees?

18:02.445 --> 18:04.425

Oh, Christ, Harry.

18:12.295 --> 18:14.285
You don't have the balls.

18:14.305 --> 18:17.315
I was five years older than you
when I came to Africa,

18:17.335 --> 18:19.345
you know that?

18:19.365 --> 18:21.425
Couldn't believe
the money you could make.

18:21.445 --> 18:24.395
The more this place gets
fucked up, the richer you get.

18:24.415 --> 18:28.435
It's like a finely tuned
looting machine.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.465
Six months, I'd have enough
to set me up back home.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.425
Open a pub, maybe,

18:33.445 --> 18:36.445
somewhere up
on the Suffolk Coast.

18:36.465 --> 18:39.405
That was 15 years ago.

18:42.405 --> 18:44.485
Not just about the money,
is it, Harry?

18:46.385 --> 18:50.455
That's not the only thing
keeping you here.

18:50.475 --> 18:53.325
It's the not going back.

18:53.345 --> 18:56.485
Not thinking about things,
things you've done,

18:56.505 --> 19:00.355

19:09.315 --> 19:10.475

20:08.405 --> 20:11.475
He's, um...
he's in the government.

20:11.495 --> 20:15.385
- He's a min... a minister for transport.
- Why is he interested in Cissé?

asking questions; I told him.

20:25.445 --> 20:26.385
Why?

20:26.405 --> 20:29.345
Because you need
to keep Damba sweet.

20:29.365 --> 20:32.315
- Government contract.
- There was a sighting of her.

20:32.335 --> 20:35.375
I gave Damba some of my men
to help for the search.

20:35.395 --> 20:37.335
- Where was the sighting?
- In Missira.

20:37.355 --> 20:40.385
It was an Internet cafe.
She broke in.
