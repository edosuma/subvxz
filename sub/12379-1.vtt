01:29.757 --> 01:31.883
And may this be the fate...

01:32.009 --> 01:34.510
of all the witches,
warlocks, and sorcerers...

01:34.636 --> 01:36.679
who attempt to work
their evil magic...

01:36.805 --> 01:39.640
within the township
limits of Roxford.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.768
The book of exorcism,
please.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.605
Mayest thou and thy kind...

01:45.731 --> 01:48.483
be condemned forever
to eternal flames...

01:48.609 --> 01:52.069
never to return
to the neighborhood of Roxford.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.866
And now, while we prepare
for the extinction...

01:56.992 --> 01:58.910
of the father of this witch...

01:59.036 --> 02:02.580
the old sorcerer who attempted
to come to her aid...

02:02.706 --> 02:04.707
there will be
a short intermission.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.376
- Popped maize.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.880
Get your fresh Indian popped maize,
tuppence a poke.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.591
It's buttered,
it's hot, it's fresh.

02:13.717 --> 02:17.345
An anti-witch charm in every poke.
Tuppence, please.

02:17.471 --> 02:21.140
Popped maize. Here we are.
It's buttered, it's fresh.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.060
Popped maize,
Master Wooley?

02:25.896 --> 02:28.231
What has got into thee,
Jonathan?

02:28.398 --> 02:31.400
- What?
- Dost doubt she was a witch?

02:31.527 --> 02:35.071
I should never have accused her
if I were not sure.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.948
And her father.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.283
Unquestionably
a sorcerer.

02:41.036 --> 02:44.288
Mother, if thou hadst
seen what I saw.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.749
We both saw our cows
turn pink, then blue...

02:46.917 --> 02:48.876
and our sheep
dancing a minuet.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.796
- But thou didst not see Jennifer.
- Jennifer?

02:51.922 --> 02:55.591
She told me her name
when she chased me into the hayloft.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.470
She was young
and beautifully fair —

02:59.596 --> 03:02.265
fairer than all women
that ever were.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.433
How didst not tell that
to the judges?

03:04.560 --> 03:07.687
Because I could never
describe her beauty.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.439
What happened
in the hayloft, Jonathan?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.441
She brought
her golden tresses...

03:12.609 --> 03:15.570
close to my face
and whispered...

03:15.696 --> 03:19.407
"Jonathan Wooley, thou hast
denounced me as a witch.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.034
For that
thou shalt be accursed.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.454
Thou and thy children
and thy children's children —

03:25.622 --> 03:28.082
all will be
under the same curse."

03:31.962 --> 03:33.754
What was the curse?

03:33.881 --> 03:36.507
I and all my descendants...

03:36.633 --> 03:38.843
will be unhappy in love.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.680
The marriages we make
will be disastrous until —

03:42.806 --> 03:44.223
Yes?

03:44.349 --> 03:47.476
- 'Tis too wicked to tell thee, Mother.
- Rubbish!

03:47.644 --> 03:50.688
Thou art in love with Purity Sykes
and even betrothed to her.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.316
- Aye, Mother.
- And Purity is a woman among thousands.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.818
Aye, Mother, she is that.

03:57.321 --> 04:00.531
Jonathan, wouldst leave
thy future wife sit there all alone?

04:00.657 --> 04:03.242
- What ails him, Mistress Wooley?
- Ah, Purity.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.286
You will find
he is a dreamer.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.705
He needs only a firm hand.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.333
Jonathan, I must ask thee
to be more attentive.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.210
- In the future —
- Look!

04:14.296 --> 04:17.839
The oak tree.
'Twill be planted over their ashes.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.676
- Why?
- To hold the evil spirits —

04:20.844 --> 04:23.638
shh! —
prisoner in its roots...

04:23.764 --> 04:27.391
thus keeping their wicked
powers from surviving.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.687
I hope.

04:35.567 --> 04:38.361
And this is the tree which was
planted over their ashes.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.863
The witches' spirits, of course...

04:41.031 --> 04:42.865
are imprisoned in its roots.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.034
Imprisoned forever.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.872
Martha...

04:49.998 --> 04:51.916
I have the honor to —

04:53.251 --> 04:55.586
- to —
- Are you proposing to me?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.338
Yes, Martha.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.215
Oh, Nathaniel!

05:04.054 --> 05:05.930
What was that?

05:08.517 --> 05:10.393
Fort Sumter fired upon!

05:10.519 --> 05:12.853
War declared
between the states!

05:16.149 --> 05:19.819
Nancy — Nancy, control yourself.
Control yourself.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.862
Drop your hand.
I wish to throw this vase!

05:21.989 --> 05:24.323
Master Wooley,
did you hear? War!

05:24.449 --> 05:26.784
Where is the nearest
recruitin' office?

05:26.910 --> 05:29.578
Running off to war
like a coward!

06:03.739 --> 06:07.658
I'm not talking about
the whole house at the moment.
It's that living room!

06:12.873 --> 06:15.458
Estelle!
Now — Now, listen to me!

06:15.625 --> 06:17.877
Estelle!

06:18.962 --> 06:21.130
Estelle.
Estelle, please.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.299
- What?
- Miss Masterson?

06:23.467 --> 06:26.093
Please. Hold it.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.636
One more.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.474
Papa, I'm leaving.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.017
Smile.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.023
Will you try to be more pleasant?
At least until after the wedding.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.025
Fellow members
of the Roxford Country Club...

06:41.151 --> 06:42.818
Dr. White's proposing
another toast.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.862
I realize that lovebirds...

06:44.988 --> 06:48.157
would like to be out on the veranda
whispering sweet nothings.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.825
[

06:49.993 --> 06:52.328
After a certain
ceremony tomorrow...

06:52.454 --> 06:56.165
they will have all the rest
of their lives for billing and cooing.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.584
- Mostly billing.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.587
But if the voters have
any sense at all, they will insist...

07:01.713 --> 07:05.466
that the first four years
of the honeymoon be spent
in the governor's mansion!

07:10.138 --> 07:12.515
Go ahead. You might pick up
a few more votes.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.518
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!

07:15.685 --> 07:18.395
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!

07:25.362 --> 07:28.239
I see getting married...

07:28.365 --> 07:32.868
as well as trying to get elected,
calls for speeches.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.626
I can truly say...

07:40.752 --> 07:43.129
that a new life
is beginning for me.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.466
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just a storm.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.135
Ladies and gentlemen...

07:49.261 --> 07:52.388
while at the moment,
the future seems a little dark —

07:52.514 --> 07:54.473
- You see?

07:54.599 --> 07:57.351
One never knows
what the next moment will bring.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.677
Where am I? What's happened?

08:31.803 --> 08:34.388
A miracle! An infernal miracle!

08:34.514 --> 08:37.265
We're free again.
Free at last!

08:37.392 --> 08:40.602
-  Who speaketh?
- 'Tis I, thy father, Daniel.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.688
But thou hast no substance.

08:42.813 --> 08:46.775
Nor hast thou, Jennifer.
We are smoke — witches' smoke.

08:46.943 --> 08:50.112
But our evil spirits
have survived.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.325
'Twill be sweet
to plague the human race again.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.661
First we'll visit
the cornfield and ruin the crop.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.664
'Tis always
a good way to limber up.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.001
Look, Father.
The cornfield is no longer there.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.420
Well, we must
expect a few changes...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.422
in 270 years.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.758
Were our spirits
in the wood that long?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.636
Aye. I counted the tree rings.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.640
See? They've built a new house.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.226
It seems all ablaze.
Is it on fire?

09:20.352 --> 09:23.395
Not yet!

09:26.524 --> 09:28.651
What's knittin', kitten?
You like to cut a rug?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.654
Let's ditch these ickies. How about
goin' to heaven in your jalopy?

09:31.821 --> 09:34.365
That's solid, Jackson.
Now you're cookin' on the front burner.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.493
What language is that,
Father?

09:37.661 --> 09:40.037
I don't know, but we'll learn it.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.670
See how they dance today.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.797
They stand so close.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.841
Well, well, well.
Things have changed.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.303
I never thought I'd see
clothes like that in New England.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.514
These cannot be
the descendants...

09:58.682 --> 10:00.599
of the Puritans we knew.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.939
There's something
that hasn't changed...

10:07.065 --> 10:09.191
in 270 years.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.652
Keep thy mind on our business!

10:11.778 --> 10:13.779
'Twould be nice to have lips —

10:13.905 --> 10:15.990
lips to whisper lies...

10:16.116 --> 10:19.326
lips to kiss a man
and make him suffer.

10:19.452 --> 10:23.080
Father, why cannot I have
lips and eyes and hair?

10:23.206 --> 10:25.332
- Careful. Someone's coming.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.835
Quick! Do as I do!

10:27.961 --> 10:30.212
These bottles —
we'll hide in them.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.423
Quick! Quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick!

10:32.549 --> 10:34.508
Whee!

10:36.720 --> 10:39.638
Are you all right, Jennifer?

10:39.764 --> 10:42.725
'Tis full of bubbles
in here. They tickle!

10:42.892 --> 10:45.894
My bottle has
the tang of maple rum!

10:46.062 --> 10:47.813
Look, Father!

10:50.442 --> 10:52.901
Come closer, man,
so I can see thee better.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.701
Riddle-dee-dee,
riddle-dee-doe...

11:00.827 --> 11:04.455
get thee hence and stub thy toe.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.465
There was
something familiar about that face.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.133
Could we follow him?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.942
- What'll it be, Mr. Wooley?
- The same — bourbon.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.779
Yes, sir, Mr. Wooley.

11:36.905 --> 11:40.657
Wooley!
I knew I recognized those features.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.576
Well, well, well.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.995
A descendant of the man
who had us burned.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.917
No wonder he looks so unhappy.

11:50.043 --> 11:54.046
I put a curse upon his family.

11:54.172 --> 11:58.133
Well, I thought lovebirds
always flew around in pairs.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.302
Estelle's talking politics.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.638
- What's the matter? Election jitters?
- No.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.141
How can I lose, with Masterson
and all his papers in back of me?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.977
My future father-in-law
has never backed a loser.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.314
If he spoils his record this time,
I'll have to hock my stethoscope.

12:12.440 --> 12:16.068
You're betting on a sure thing, Dudley.
He isn't missing a trick. Look at that.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.612
Posters at a private party.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.157
The whole marriage is just
another campaign stunt to him —

12:22.283 --> 12:24.868
insisting we hold it
the day before the election...

12:24.994 --> 12:27.830
so I'll get a good
publicity break on election day.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.624
Wallace, I think
you've had enough to drink.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.085
- Now, Estelle —
- I'd like to go home.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.587
Yes, dear.
Can we drop you, Dudley?

12:35.713 --> 12:37.339
Yes, thanks.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.177
The curse is working.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.138
She has the look of a shrew!

12:46.182 --> 12:47.850
Here, Tom.

12:53.648 --> 12:58.068
Jennifer, what's that curse
thou wast chattering about?

12:58.194 --> 13:01.196
Each Wooley
must marry the wrong woman.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.323
Ha! What a curse!

13:03.450 --> 13:05.534
Every man who marries...

13:05.702 --> 13:07.744
marries the wrong woman.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.914
True suffering cometh...

13:11.040 --> 13:14.835
when a man is in love
with the woman he cannot marry.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.005
Father, suppose a man
were in love with a witch.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.008
With me.
I would not marry him.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.802
Ha!
Ooh, pardon me.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.762
I need air.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.931
d For tonight
I'll merry, merry be d

13:28.057 --> 13:31.685
d Tomorrow I'll be sober dd

13:31.811 --> 13:33.520
Let's get out of here.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.231
Let's go for a little ride.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.194
Broom!

13:42.071 --> 13:44.698
Father, give me a body.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.783
Oh, no.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.078
Thou didst get into enough
trouble with thy last one.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.247
Thou canst not
give me a body.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.416
Thou wouldst not even know
how to begin.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.419
No? I'd merely make a little fire.

13:57.587 --> 14:01.006
As thy last body
was destroyed by flame...

14:01.132 --> 14:04.051
thy new one would be
born in flame!

14:04.177 --> 14:07.221
Prove it.
Start that great house on fire.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.015
A hotel for pilgrims.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.184
'Twould be a pleasure
burning that.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.228
All right, i will.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.855
Worra, worra, fizzle, dizzle...

14:16.981 --> 14:20.192
let the flame begin to sizzle!

14:20.318 --> 14:23.946
P-I-L-G-R-I-M...

14:24.072 --> 14:26.740
H-O-T-E-L!

14:26.866 --> 14:29.284
- Good-bye, Father.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.287
Good-bye, Jennifer.
Be a bad girl.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.463
- That's the Pilgrim Hotel!
- It would have to be
on our way home.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.549
- We'll have to stop.

14:43.675 --> 14:47.219
You wouldn't go through fire
for your future wife?

14:52.684 --> 14:55.894
Boy, look at those flames.
I never saw such a fire.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.731
- Is there any way we can get through?
- Sorry, Mr. Wooley. It's all blocked off.

15:01.651 --> 15:05.404
- Some firebug must've touched this off.
- He did a good job!

15:06.739 --> 15:09.658
This is the craziest fire
I've ever seen!

15:09.784 --> 15:12.494
Laps up water like a cat!

15:12.620 --> 15:15.831
- You're sure everybody got out?
- Yes, sir. We've checked every room.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.749
Yeah, they're all
accounted for.

15:17.875 --> 15:21.461
It's all right, men. Everybody's safe.
Get these people back.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.297
We're stuck here
for a while.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.174
Tell them who you are.
They'll have to make way.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.844
- I'm sorry, Estelle.
- Wallace, where are you going?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.432
- There's Mr. Wooley!

15:33.558 --> 15:37.019
- Make way for Wooley.
- Make way for the next governor.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.355
- Would you like to go through?
- Yes, thank you.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.482
Folks, let him get by.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.818
- I'm voting for you.
- There goes a great guy.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.070
- Hello, Mr. Wooley.
- Hello.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.032
Don't get too close.
I got a bet riding on you.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.701
- How did it happen?
- Nobody seems to know.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.079
There was an explosion on the roof.
The top floor went like that.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.373
Then the fifth,
then the fourth.

15:58.499 --> 16:02.127
Now it's on the third. Soon it'll be
on the second, and then the first...

16:02.253 --> 16:04.713
then it'll all cave in on the basement.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.215
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's fully insured...

16:07.342 --> 16:09.259
and I love
building new things.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.762
I want to build it
in a classic gothic design.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.182
- Don't you love gothic? Huh?
- Quiet.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.809
What was that?
Did you hear that voice?

16:27.070 --> 16:29.863
Somebody's inside.
Listen!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.573
I didn't hear anything.

16:31.699 --> 16:35.369
It was so clear!
A woman's voice.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.413
Aw, there's nobody in there.
They've looked everywhere.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.083
No, wait. Wait.
There it is again!

16:55.264 --> 16:57.224
Here i am, Mr. Wooley.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.267
- Over here.
- Where?

16:59.394 --> 17:01.311
I-I can't see!

17:01.437 --> 17:04.146
Just walk.
You'll find me.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.444
Keep walking.
This way. This way.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.780
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.741
Two legs, two arms,
a face, hair.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.868
- Yes, I seem to be complete.
- Why don't you come out?

17:17.994 --> 17:20.122
i've been waiting for you,
Mr. Wooley.

17:20.248 --> 17:23.666
- Where are you?
- You're getting warmer.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.127
Here's my hand.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.922
How can I get you out?
I can't see a thing.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.633
I can see you.
How do you do?

17:31.801 --> 17:33.844
Never mind.
Let's get out of here!

17:33.970 --> 17:36.388
- Have you a gazing glass?
- A what?

17:36.514 --> 17:38.598
A mirror.
I want to see what I look like.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.976
- At a time like this?
- Oh, I'm cold.

17:41.144 --> 17:44.104
- Cold? In this furnace?
- But I have no clothes.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.732
No clothes?
Here, put this on.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.234
How did you get here?

17:49.360 --> 17:51.194
From the top floor.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.488
Why do you look away?
Am I not pretty?

17:53.614 --> 17:55.157
Who cares? Come on.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.617
- Get up, get up!

17:57.744 --> 17:59.661
I can't!

17:59.829 --> 18:01.830
Here, I'll carry you.

18:01.998 --> 18:05.333
Legs are funny when you're
not used to them, aren't they?

18:05.501 --> 18:08.378
- Huh?
- Why are you in such a hurry?

18:08.504 --> 18:12.674
Why? The whole building
was on the third floor,
and now it's fallen to the second.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.968
When this ceiling gives way,
we'll be buried alive.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.845
Nothing will happen to us.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.765
- You don't know
what you're talking about.
- Yes, I do.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.808
Ah! Here's a door!

18:24.020 --> 18:25.479
Here!

18:26.606 --> 18:29.900
- Oh!

18:34.447 --> 18:37.199
- Oh!

18:37.366 --> 18:39.367
This way's blocked.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.871
The bars on the window.
Quick —

18:43.039 --> 18:45.665
- Where are you?
- I've found a better coat.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.544
And a mirror!
Mm, not bad.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.379
Oh, I'm a blond.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.382
Would you rather
I be a brunette?

18:54.550 --> 18:58.011
If you don't get out of this fire,
you'll be a redhead!
Don't you realize —

19:14.862 --> 19:17.072
That was the second floor.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.326
Well, there's no way out.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.079
We're goners, little girl.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.206
Perhaps I should be little.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.584
I'm just as high
as your heart.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.878
Did you hear what I said?
We're trapped.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.422
Just we two.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.675
Look, before I got here...

19:36.801 --> 19:39.261
what — what hit you
on the head?

19:39.387 --> 19:42.347
I felt nothing
until your hand touched mine.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.099
Oh, I see.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.434
Well, it was nice meeting you.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.436
Oh, would you like
to leave now?

19:48.604 --> 19:50.522
It would be a pleasure...

19:50.648 --> 19:52.816
but that door is now a wall.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.944
Oh. Then we can use
the one behind the screen.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.659
- Quick! It's our only chance!
- I want to fix my hair.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.786
Come on,
while you still have a head!

20:26.809 --> 20:28.602
Do you like blonds?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.979
May I get a picture?
Hold it right there.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.523
He saved somebody!

20:33.649 --> 20:35.358
Stand back, people.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.740
- Are you all right?
- I guess so.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.576
- You certainly gave me a scare.
- Wally...

20:44.702 --> 20:47.245
- take me away from these people.
- Here, Dudley.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.247
She's suffering from shock.

20:49.373 --> 20:53.251
Well, uh
guess I'd better take you to a hospital.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.674
Oh, well,
I hope she's all right.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.885
It's only natural
for you to be concerned.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.597
Estelle, I've told you a dozen times.
There's no point in — Well?

21:05.723 --> 21:08.099
It's amazing.
Not a scratch on her. Not a burn.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.852
- You must be relieved.
- You've known me all my life.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.188
She never met Wally.
The girl's suffering from delusions.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.190
You see?
She has delusions.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.693
- Well, I haven't!
- Estelle, you must believe me!

21:18.819 --> 21:21.488
- Listen to me.
- I've never seen her before...

21:21.614 --> 21:23.823
and I —
I'll never see her again!

21:49.934 --> 21:53.186
- Dear, you ought —
- It's silly to drive me home
and then back here.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.688
- You need rest.
- Darling —

21:54.814 --> 21:57.857
I know best. You have to get used
to pleasing me sometimes.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.777
- All right, dear.
- Ooh, you still smell of smoke.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.531
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

22:14.792 --> 22:18.503
Susie, you know you can't
come in until breakfast time.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.297
- Scat!

22:21.424 --> 22:23.174
Scat!

22:24.427 --> 22:26.511
Susie! Susie!

22:33.269 --> 22:34.686
Susie?

22:37.606 --> 22:39.190
Susie, where are you?

22:39.316 --> 22:40.900
Hello, darling.

22:41.027 --> 22:44.487
- I thought you'd never
get rid of that girl.
- What are you doing here?

22:44.613 --> 22:46.656
Waiting for you.

22:46.782 --> 22:50.118
- But the hospital, the —
- I didn't like it there.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.412
How did you get here?

22:52.538 --> 22:55.290
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.251
What am I to do with you?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.712
Just look on me
as an old friend of the family.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.798
- I never laid eyes on you before.
- Come here, Wally.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.633
Am I not
an attractive female?

23:05.801 --> 23:08.595
- What's that got to do
with your being here?
- Am I?

23:08.721 --> 23:11.181
Yes, yes,
you're very pretty.

23:11.307 --> 23:15.226
- Take my hand again.
- Now, come. I know you've had
a terrible experience.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.479
And now a pleasant one.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.982
You... have
a very nice hand.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.193
And now it can shake
mine good night.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.488
- Your hand is cold.
- Well, so is yours.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.198
Yes, good-good night.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.784
Let mine rest
in yours a moment.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.786
See?
It's growing warmer.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.954
Well, that's fine.
That's fi—

23:36.999 --> 23:39.667
- Amusing-looking chap, isn't he?
- Yes.

23:39.794 --> 23:42.337
- Ancestor of mine.
- I'm aware he is.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.380
Jonathan Wooley.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.508
He would have been
more hospitable.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.218
Oh, I don't think so.

23:48.344 --> 23:51.429
Well, I have a busy day tomorrow.
It's time for beddy-bye.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.933
- Mm, take my hand again.
- You're becoming a problem.

23:55.059 --> 23:58.520
- Am I?
- Yes, and that is not the solution.

23:58.687 --> 24:02.607
See, it isn't respectable for you
to be sitting in a stranger's house.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.360
- I like your resisting me.
- Oh, you do?

24:05.486 --> 24:09.322
- You know what I'm going
to do with you now?
- Yes.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.617
Just, uh, get up, please.

24:13.911 --> 24:16.412
- Where are you taking me, Wally?
- We're going out.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.498
Night, Jonathan!

24:20.876 --> 24:24.420
I'm going to give you money,
and you can go back
wherever you came from.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.881
- No, not yet.
- Yes, right now!

24:27.007 --> 24:29.259
Ooh, this is
a lovely sensation.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.344
Even nicer than flying.

24:36.559 --> 24:40.061
- What's going on, Governor?
- Not "Governor" yet, Fred.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.438
She was in a fire
and lost her clothes.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.899
No, I didn't.
I didn't have any.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.570
- Evening, Mr. Wooley.
- Have you any money, Joe?

24:48.737 --> 24:50.405
About eight bucks.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.407
Well, I only have ten,
but here.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.660
Give it all to her and take her
anyplace she wants to go.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.913
I'll pay you tomorrow.
For heaven's sake, be good.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.790
What'll I do with the coat?

25:00.916 --> 25:03.418
When you're through with it,
send it to the police.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.264
It-It didn't belong to her.
[ Nervous Chuckle ]

25:16.432 --> 25:18.933
I hope that cab is heated.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.314
Where to, lady?

25:24.440 --> 25:26.024
Where to?

26:07.608 --> 26:08.942
Oh.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.027
Hope I didn't butt in
on a pleasant dream.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.488
Just wanted to make sure
you're all right.

26:13.614 --> 26:16.032
- You've certainly earned a drink.
- I'll say I have.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.035
Upstairs you go. Get a good
night's sleep. I'll take this.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.496
- Dudley, she was here!
- Who was here?

26:21.664 --> 26:24.290
The girl
I saved in the fire.

26:24.416 --> 26:28.169
That's impossible.
When I left her in the hospital,
she was sleeping like an angel.

26:28.295 --> 26:31.339
Well, that's some hospital.
She got away. And some angel.

26:31.465 --> 26:35.677
Now, wait a minute, hmm?
Tell me this again slowly.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.680
No, tomorrow.
I've had enough for one day.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.390
How about me?

26:40.516 --> 26:42.517
I've got $1 0,000
tied up in this election.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.602
If this gets out,
you're a dead goose.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.813
Think of the scandal —
the night before your wedding.

26:46.939 --> 26:50.024
That's it — the election!
That girl was sent here
by the opposition.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.068
- They're trying to frame me.
- You're right.

26:52.194 --> 26:55.363
Rainfogle and that bunch wouldn't
stop at anything. Did anybody see her?

26:55.489 --> 26:58.992
- Nobody who'll do any talking.
- Good. I'll put her down
as an amnesia case.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.744
Give the police a description.
Was she wearing that fur coat?

27:03.580 --> 27:06.040
Maybe you'd better not
say anything to the police.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.751
Everything's all right now.
I got rid of her.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.170
Well, try and forget her, then.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.423
You want a pill
to make you sleep?

27:13.549 --> 27:16.551
No. No, thanks.
I'm much calmer now.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.971
Oh, make sure
the door locks.

27:20.097 --> 27:22.682
Okay. Relax, now.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.061
- Good night, Wally.

27:27.229 --> 27:30.356
Now close this door, Wally.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.817
I said
close this door, Wally.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.575
Now come here.

27:40.743 --> 27:43.077
I'm coming.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.204
My pajamas.

27:45.331 --> 27:49.083
I don't want to call the police,
but I know your whole scheme.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.377
- You do?
- And I know who's behind it all.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.963
- You don't.
- Want me to mention names?

27:54.089 --> 27:57.091
- What names?
- County Chairman
Martin J. Rainfogle.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.427
- That's a nice name.
- Want another?

27:59.553 --> 28:04.349
- Mm-hmm.
- State Senator Conrad O'Hara Jr.

28:04.475 --> 28:08.186
Sheriff Peter L. Glasshauser
and all his ward heelers.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.439
- How much are they paying you?
- Nothing.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.524
Ha! Hmm?

28:13.650 --> 28:16.110
You're just doing it
for love, hmm?

28:16.278 --> 28:18.780
Yes. Father thought
it'd be a good idea.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.865
- Who is your father?
- You've never met him.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.618
But he doesn't want this state
to have a good administration.

28:23.786 --> 28:26.120
Father doesn't want any state
to have a good administration.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.207
- But he's out to get me particularly.
- Yes.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.295
I am a pretty good judge
of character...

28:34.463 --> 28:37.006
and I don't think
you're really a bad girl.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.301
- Don't you?
- You're very young.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.387
I'm older
than you'd guess.

28:42.513 --> 28:45.431
I don't think you ought
to go back to that father.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.350
I'd rather stay with you.

28:47.476 --> 28:48.976
You would?

28:51.021 --> 28:52.980
You really would,
wouldn't you?

28:54.983 --> 28:56.984
Now I understand.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.278
Just because I was
of some slight help...

28:59.405 --> 29:02.031
in getting you out
of that blazing inferno...

29:02.157 --> 29:05.868
perhaps you are, momentarily,
infatuated with me.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.871
But it isn't love.
And I'm not in love with you.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.749
I guess this'll take
longer than I planned.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.837
I'm afraid you have
rather a romantic mind.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.673
You see, love isn't
just a matter of...

29:18.841 --> 29:22.093
two people meeting
under romantic circumstances.

29:22.219 --> 29:26.013
Love — that is,
love that is really worthwhile —

29:26.181 --> 29:28.349
grows slowly.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.351
Real love is...

29:30.477 --> 29:32.186
like a painting.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.031
Ah, yes.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.534
Yes, there have been
thousands and thousands...

29:46.660 --> 29:49.328
of couples just like us...

29:49.455 --> 29:51.873
going their separate ways...

29:52.040 --> 29:55.251
never realizing the other
was waiting somewhere.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.045
Why, Romeo and Juliet
knew right away.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.923
That's what Shakespeare's
trying to tell us.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.093
Of course, the case
of Dante and Beatrice...

30:04.219 --> 30:05.887
is a trifle different.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.680
He saw her only once.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.141
But in that moment,
the whole world...

30:10.267 --> 30:12.226
was bathed in a new light.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.021
It wasn't just a humdrum world
anymore, where you had to...

30:15.147 --> 30:17.899
get up in the morning and meet
a lot of stupid people.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.567
- Who's that?

30:19.735 --> 30:21.611
-  8:00, Mr. Wooley.
- What?

30:21.737 --> 30:24.989
- 8:00.
- That's impossible.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.867
But... it's true!

30:27.993 --> 30:30.328
- Good morning, Wally.
- Good morning, Jennifer.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.079
It's fantastic.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.333
It just seems like a few minutes
since I came in.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.418
Don't you want
your breakfast?

30:38.754 --> 30:41.255
You're as bad as when
you were a little boy.

30:41.423 --> 30:45.426
Even on a day like this, I have
to call you half a dozen times.

30:45.594 --> 30:48.095
Oh, and what a —

30:48.263 --> 30:51.265
what a beautiful day
it is too.

30:51.433 --> 30:54.519
Happy is the bride
that the sun...

30:54.645 --> 30:56.979
shines on.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.940
Good morning.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.567
Mmm!
That smells good!

31:04.154 --> 31:06.697
You don't know how long
it's been since I've eaten.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.200
- Mr. Wooley —
- I'll explain later, Margaret.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.619
- What can you possibly say?
- Well, you —

31:11.745 --> 31:13.955
No, no, dear.
Not like that.

31:14.081 --> 31:17.625
First you butter them, hmm?
And then a little syrup.

31:17.793 --> 31:20.836
Mr. Wooley, I've worked
for your family for 30 years...

31:20.963 --> 31:22.964
been almost
a mother to you...

31:23.131 --> 31:26.008
and to think that on this day,
of all days —

31:27.469 --> 31:31.097
Oh, yes, and send up
some evening gowns too, please.

31:31.223 --> 31:34.809
You see, everything
the young lady had was burned.

31:34.935 --> 31:38.312
Send them up right away, please.
Thank you.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.691
You know, I think you've broken
my record for waffles.

31:41.817 --> 31:45.111
Well, Margaret likes
nothing better than to make them.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.780
Those people are still
downstairs waiting.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.616
Margaret, these have made
a great hit with her.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.244
- What did you say?
- Those people.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.997
I told you they were here
three batches of waffles ago.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.040
You did?
I don't remember.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.960
Uh, people waiting?
Who? Who are they?

32:01.086 --> 32:03.421
- You'll find out.
- Excuse me.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.509
Mm, more waffles?

32:08.635 --> 32:10.678
There's no more batter.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.018
Oh! I'm sorry, Margaret.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.478
- Better be sorry for yourself.
- Huh?

32:19.605 --> 32:23.232
It's Miss Masterson downstairs,
with her father.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.525
Who?

32:24.693 --> 32:27.486
Miss Masterson,
the lady you're getting married to.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.238
Oh!

32:32.909 --> 32:34.869
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32:35.037 --> 32:37.622
I'd forgotten
you were going to drop in.

32:37.748 --> 32:39.999
We didn't say we were.
What's the matter with you?

32:40.125 --> 32:43.586
Have you seen the papers?
I've got you all over the front page.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.172
That's great.
Dear, hadn't you better go?

32:46.298 --> 32:50.217
- It's bad luck for the groom to see
the bride before the wedding.
- Don't be ridiculous.

32:50.385 --> 32:53.846
Saving that girl was the luckiest break.
You don't know what that can do for you.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.556
I have a rough idea.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.976
I've arranged a special broadcast
about the fire. You're to be interviewed.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.228
- I'll have you back by 1 1 :00.
- That's fine.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.606
That gives me plenty of time.
Shall we go?

33:03.732 --> 33:05.316
No, I'm going to stay here.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.819
I want to see about
brightening up this antique shop.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.322
- The photographers will be here.
- There's no time.

33:11.448 --> 33:15.117
- Run along.
- I'm a little on edge,
with the wedding at noon.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.495
I'd feel much better
if you came along.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.789
There.
That's a good girl.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.126
Excuse me.
I'll get my hat.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.592
[ Estelle Shrieks ]

33:32.844 --> 33:35.596
- How did that happen?
- it just slammed shut.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.017
I'm terribly sorry.
There's rather a heavy draft...

33:40.143 --> 33:42.186
blowing through
the house today.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.155
What's he going out
with her for?

33:53.281 --> 33:55.074
Why shouldn't he?

33:55.200 --> 33:57.952
He's going to marry her
in less than two hours.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.496
- As for you, young woman —
- Oh, go to sleep.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.293
After all my work!

34:12.967 --> 34:15.261
No, I don't want to go.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.724
Two hours.
That doesn't give me much time.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.684
I wish Father were here.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.145
What seems to be the trouble?

34:24.312 --> 34:27.356
Oh, good morning, Father.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.150
I need some advice.
He's tougher than I thought.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.152
I can't seem
to make him love me.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.530
Thou art the veriest bungler.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.324
I must have been drunk
to give thee a body.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.659
Oh, don't smoke
so much, Father.

34:39.786 --> 34:43.371
- Did something go wrong
with thy philter?
- My what?

34:43.498 --> 34:46.792
Thy love philter.
Thou gavest him one, I presume.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.754
No. I thought I could
do it barehanded.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.507
Art thou a witch or a woman?
Prepare a love philter at once.

34:53.632 --> 34:55.885
Dost thou recall
the incantation? Listen.

Now put in a cool place
until ready.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.929
- What will it taste like, Father?
- Like cool water...

35:40.055 --> 35:42.389
but 'twill set
Master Wooley's blood on fire.

35:42.516 --> 35:45.184
Then I'll treat him
like a slave.

35:45.310 --> 35:48.562
I'll make him suffer,
body and soul.

35:48.688 --> 35:52.733
Speaking of bodies,
I have a notion to make
a personal appearance myself.

35:52.901 --> 35:56.153
Of course, I'll have to burn
a house down to do it.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.405
Not this one, Father.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.325
I've a better idea:
the building he's in now.

36:01.451 --> 36:04.161
- 'Twill force him back to me.
- Excellent!

36:04.287 --> 36:06.539
Good hunting, Jennifer.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.415
'Tis growing cool.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.377
Now we shall see
if thou canst resist me.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.839
Get ready, Master Wooley.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.726
- Not dressed yet?
- I'm lucky to be alive.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.562
What's happened now?

36:29.688 --> 36:33.399
I was making a broadcast
about the fire, and suddenly
I was in another one.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.985
- Mysterious explosion on the roof.
- Anybody hurt?

36:36.111 --> 36:39.113
No, we all got out all right.
What's wrong with this door?

36:42.742 --> 36:44.285
Margaret!

36:45.453 --> 36:47.788
What are you two doing
in my bedroom?

36:47.956 --> 36:49.582
What happened?

36:49.708 --> 36:52.209
Oh, I —
I must have dozed off.

36:52.335 --> 36:55.462
Go upstairs and get dressed.
Where's the brandy?

36:55.589 --> 36:58.465
- Did you get rid of that girl?
- "That girl"?

36:58.633 --> 37:01.218
Oh! She must still be here.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.470
Well, she won't
be here for long.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.685
Ah, you listen to me,
young lady.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.021
Come on, come on.
Get up.

37:12.147 --> 37:15.190
I'm listening, Mr. Wooley.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.276
Why do you look
at me that way?

37:18.653 --> 37:21.447
Oh... my dress.
Do you like it?

37:21.573 --> 37:23.657
I — I don't know.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.493
It's such a shock
to see you dressed.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.120
I mean...

37:28.246 --> 37:30.831
- you're beautiful.
- Enough to make a man fall in love?

37:30.957 --> 37:33.000
Mere physical beauty
isn't everything.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.002
That's what I thought.

37:35.128 --> 37:38.505
-  Look, Jennifer —
- I don't like the tone of your voice.

37:38.632 --> 37:41.967
I swallowed some smoke last night,
and I just swallowed more now.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.679
- But that's not going to stop me —
- Wally wants a drink of water.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.514
Nice, cool water.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.975
Thank you.
Now, all I have to say —

37:50.101 --> 37:51.769
Drink it, Wally...

37:51.895 --> 37:54.313
and then I'll be glad to hear
anything you have to say.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.359
You'll find out that
no one named Wooley...

37:58.526 --> 38:00.653
is able to stay
away from me.

38:01.863 --> 38:05.282
Oh, i'm awfully sorry.
This is terrible.

- What happened?

38:26.221 --> 38:29.014
Well, the picture fell.
Does your head hurt?

38:30.058 --> 38:31.809
- My head?
- Mm.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.727
No.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.396
It's my heart.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.357
- It feels so light.
- Try not to talk.

38:38.483 --> 38:42.111
Oh, but I must.
I must tell you how I feel.

38:42.237 --> 38:46.198

- Don't start that again.

Oh, my darling.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.331
Let that man alone!

38:54.457 --> 38:56.625
Dudley, something really
happened to her this time.

38:56.751 --> 39:00.421
- She got a sock on the head.
That picture —
- You did it in self-defense.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.881
Aren't you glad
you drank it, Wally?

39:03.008 --> 39:05.259
- I didn't drink anything.
- What's she talking about?

39:05.427 --> 39:08.595
A drink of water. I gave it to her
when she was coming to.

39:08.722 --> 39:11.056
You gave it to me?

39:11.182 --> 39:15.227
Never force liquids
on a person who's unconscious.
It may have serious consequences.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.730

39:17.856 --> 39:20.482
- Come on. We're late.
- What are we going to do?

39:20.608 --> 39:22.276
- Lock her in this room.
- But, Dudley —

39:22.402 --> 39:24.278
Come on,
before she marries you.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.618
Stop worrying.
She can't get out.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.829
I'll drive.
You're too nervous.

39:33.955 --> 39:36.749
You'll have to get rid of her
after the wedding.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.671
Poor little girl.
All alone in the world...

39:42.797 --> 39:44.757
except for a no-good father.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.722
Don't ever jam
your brakes on like that!

39:51.848 --> 39:54.475
I didn't jam them.
It just stopped.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.102
- I can't figure it out.
- What's that smoke?

39:59.147 --> 40:01.315
- What happened to him?
- Who?

40:01.441 --> 40:04.193
The fellow we pulled
out of the fire. He's gone!

40:05.236 --> 40:07.279
How do you like my body, Jennifer?

40:07.405 --> 40:11.075
Not too old, not too young.
I'm sorry I've forgotten
the formula for clothing.

40:11.201 --> 40:13.660
I had to borrow this sheet
from the ambulance.

40:13.787 --> 40:17.206
By the by, has the potion
been administered?

40:17.332 --> 40:18.791
Yes.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.252
Father, something
went wrong with our plan.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.963

- He must mean another county.

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:59.061
Hold everything.
Here's a flash, folks.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:02.856
At 1 0:45 tonight, with only three
precincts yet to be heard from...

01:05:02.983 --> 01:05:04.775
election returns were as follows:

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:08.320
Wallace Wooley — 2,684,922.

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:10.656
Elwood Bensinger — none.

01:05:12.284 --> 01:05:14.201
He didn't even vote
for himself.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:17.913
Dudley, I've married a witch.
What am I going to do?

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:21.584
Let me look at you.
Did you say
she's 800,000 years old?

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:25.004
No, no, no, no, no.
That's her father. She's only 290.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.548
- I see.
- But you'd never think it.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:29.883
Well, marriage does
a lot for people.

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:33.762
Well, Wally,
this clears everything up.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.849
All except one little point:

01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:39.560
How did she get out
of the hospital that night?

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:42.855
- She used a broom.
- Oh, of course!

01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:46.692
I must be getting stupid.
A child would know that.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.195
Dudley, what —
what am I going to do?

01:05:50.322 --> 01:05:53.407
- How many people have you told?
- No one but you. How can I?

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:56.118
I see your point.
People are so skeptical.

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:59.246
Might be hard to grasp
that the first lady is a witch.

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.582
- I don't care about them.
What about me?
- Look out!

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.336
Are you satisfied, darling?
You're the new governor.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.380
- What are you going to do now?
- Help you with your slippers.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:12.051
- No, not just yet.
- Then I'll warm them by the fire.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.305
You know, I lighted it
with a match, Wally.

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:19.892
From now on, I'm going to be
just a simple, helpful wife.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:23.771
Dudley, I can't take it.
"A helpful wife."
What if she runs me for president?

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:26.231
- What's that?

01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:29.485
People gathering in the street.
They want you to make a speech.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:32.780
- Real people?
- Naturally. They all voted for Wally.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.782
- What am I gonna say to them?
- I don't know.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:38.077
There are one or two things
I wouldn't tell them. Good night.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:42.247
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta be getting home —
into my straightjacket!

01:06:42.374 --> 01:06:45.417
- Would you like me to drive you?
- No, thanks. I'll call a broom —

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:47.211
I mean, a taxi.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:52.257
- Wally, darling.
- Yes, dear?

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.595
You don't mind
my being a witch, do you?

01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:58.931
Well, you'll admit
it's a little unusual.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:01.975
- No one need ever know.
- We'll talk about that later, dear.

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.436
It'll be our little secret.

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:06.689
Our little secret?

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:09.608
Now go out and make
your speech to them, dear.

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.540
Good evening, my dear.

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:28.752
- Three cheers
for Wallace Wooley!

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.796
Hurray!

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.134
I must compliment you
on the public confidence...

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:37.302
you have inspired
for Master Wooley.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.931
- You're not going to hurt him again?
- I will attend to him later.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.726
I am concerned now
with an erring daughter.

01:07:43.852 --> 01:07:45.811
I've done nothing
except love him.

01:07:45.937 --> 01:07:48.063
You have informed him
that you are a witch.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:50.274
Need I remind you
of the punishment...

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.484
that I must
perforce administer?

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.945
At midnight,
back to the tree!

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:59.158
There to stay until the present
race of men is extinguished.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:03.871
A rather light sentence,
considering the offense.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.956
But if I don't wish to go —

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.959
- There is nothing you can do about it.
- I'm still a witch.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.712
No, my dear. Your heart
is so full of human love...

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.131
that I can
no longer trust you.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:17.843
Until you have resumed
a more spirit-like existence...

01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:20.679
you shall be
a mere mortal!

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:23.265
I've remembered
all the spells you've taught me.

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:27.519
Out, fire,
by Rhadamanthus!

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:32.274
- Out!
You see?

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:36.194
Your power is dead.
Mine remains.

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:38.488
Out, fire.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.491
Better get ready.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.410
Soonest done,
soonest mended...

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:45.496
and midnight approaches.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.167
May I... say good-bye?

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:53.212
Certainly, my dear.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.425
I'll be around.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:03.263
...endeavor to give this fair state

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.557
an honest administration.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:08.769
As a former governor
so aptly put it —

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.687
Wally! Wally!

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:15.149
Uh, and in conclusion,
thank you very much.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.484
What is it?

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:19.738
- You must help me!
- You want me to help you?

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:22.448
- Come on, darling. Hurry!
- No, no. But where?

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:26.245
- Anywhere.
Out the back door. Hurry up.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.252
Anyplace, Joe.
Just drive around.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:36.212
Hey!

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.006
That's my cab!

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:44.304
- What is all this?
- I had to get you away.
Something might have happened to you.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.765
- What?
- I don't know, but something awful.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:50.018
- Can't you tell me about it now?
- Wally, I'm afraid!

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:51.603
You are afraid.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:55.107
What trouble can you be in
that you can't get out of by witchcraft?

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:57.317
- I've lost my power.
- What?

01:09:57.443 --> 01:10:00.320
I'm not a witch any longer.
I'm like any other girl.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:04.783
I wish we could go so fast
that no power on earth could overtake us!

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:08.245
- Faster!
- Nothing's going to happen
to you while I'm around.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.878
You are like any other girl —
afraid of lightning.

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:18.130
That isn't ordinary lightning.

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:21.133
- Can't he go any faster?
- Step on it, Joe.

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.135
Faster.

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.816
Nobody could
possibly catch us.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:40.903
Joe's a wonderful driver.
There's nothing he can't do with the car.

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:05.010
They've certainly
improved this road.

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.973
Is it midnight yet?

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.351
No.
Five minutes to 1 2:00.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.444
Don't look!

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.868
[ Daniel ]
Back to the tree!

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:45.008
[ Daniel Cackling ]

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.719
Don't worry about me,
Master Wooley.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:50.222
I am accustomed to fire.

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:51.974
Come, Jennifer.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.560
I have decided to return
with thee to the tree.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:58.021
I am weary of mortals.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:02.859
There's no use fighting.
It has to be like this.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.988
- Jennifer, what are you saying?
- Go, Wally. Please.

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:11.326
Midnight.
Good-bye, my darling.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:14.287
I want you
to remember me as I was:

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:16.289
just an ordinary girl.

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:20.043
-  He'll remember.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.587
That will be his torture.

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:27.426
And I'll remember
that I loved you.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:30.846
Through all eternity
I'll remember.

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:32.723
[ Cackles ]

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:36.727
Thou wilt remember
nothing of this tender feeling.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.896
That will be the essence
of thy punishment.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.400
I'll never forget.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.319
With all my strength
I'll fight.

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:50.282
Love is stronger
than witchcraft.

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:52.909
I'll remember everything —

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:54.911
the sound of your voice...

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:57.164
your worried looks...

01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:00.500
the warmth of your arms
around me...

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.586
the touch of your lips.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.136
Good-bye, Wally.

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.430
Good-bye, my darling.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.640
I'll remember.

01:13:15.767 --> 01:13:18.268
i'll always remember.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.437
Always.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:23.857
Always. Always.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.205
Look at him.
Is it not good to see him suffer?

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:40.123
Yes, Father.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:43.835
Is this not a perfect revenge
on the Wooleys?

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:47.047
Yes, Father.
Could we follow him?

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.673
And why?

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.550
To watch him suffer,
of course.

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:52.427
Well said, Jennifer!

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:55.180
Thou art a witch again!

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.564
She's dead, Master Wooley.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:07.818
Thy marriage
is a mournful memory.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.363
Let's be gone, Jennifer.

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:14.324
Let me tarry
but a moment at this window.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.159
I wish to see it all.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.829
Thou art enjoying it, eh?

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.789
Oh, yes. And thou?

01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:24.876
I cannot remember
when I've had a better time.

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.879
[ Cackles ]
It's great in here.

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:33.468
I've called a doctor,
Mr. Wooley.

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:39.558
Jennifer?

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:42.811
The sound of his voice —

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:45.355
it no longer thrills thee?

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.899
- No, Father.
- Good.

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:50.277
And his worried looks?

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:55.031
And the warmth
of his arms around thee?

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:59.494
These are things
that have no meaning for me now.

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.416
And the touch of his lips?

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:22.767
Wally...

01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:26.605
love is stronger
than witchcraft.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.650
d For tonight I'll merry, merry be d

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.821
d For tonight
I'll merry, merry be d

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:39.367
- d Tomorrow I'll be sober dd
- Oh, no, you won't.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:44.247
Wally, darling,
all our troubles are over.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.166
At least for the present.

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:00.972
Mr. Wooley...

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:04.559
I've been with your family
for 37 years, but this is the end.

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:08.521
- What is it, Margaret?
- I simply cannot handle your daughter!

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:13.276
Jennifer!

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.570
I told you never
to play with that broom.

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:17.155
Why?

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:20.617
I'm afraid we're going to have
trouble with her someday.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.869
Oh, that's impossible.

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:25.789
I hope.

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:35.340
