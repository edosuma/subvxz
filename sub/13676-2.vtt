00:11.095 --> 00:15.054
We get these warm spells sometimes
in December with no humidity.

00:15.766 --> 00:19.384
-DOCTOR: It's been a nice couple of days.
-Yeah.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.515
I went on a winter holiday to Florida once.

00:22.607 --> 00:24.598
Lorraine wanted to see it.

00:24.692 --> 00:28.935
I don't mind telling you,
there wasn't nothing there I want to see twice.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.571
DOCTOR: Sit down, Albert.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.489
No, thank you. I'm not tired.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.442
DOCTOR: I didn't say you were.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.120
| just got a lot of energy, Doc.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.291
You know, I've been feeling a whole lot better.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.494
Shoot, | feel I could almost go back to work.

00:46.589 --> 00:50.423

a temporary improvement.

00:55.306 --> 00:56.546
But,

01:01.354 --> 01:03.390

01:05.107 --> 01:09.976

weren't what we'd hoped for.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.903

01:21.666 --> 01:23.327

03:42.223 --> 03:44.134
Cherise's boyfriend got shot, Mr. Batiste.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.261
He died.

03:46.352 --> 03:47.467
Oh, no.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.851
Deron?

03:49.939 --> 03:52.021
-Deron Coleman?
-Cherise was there when they shot him.

03:52.108 --> 03:53.097
What?

03:53.192 --> 03:55.899
She and Deron was walking up the street
and a car rolled up on them.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.066
Cherise wasn't hit, was she?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.143
No, she's all right.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.901
But why?
I mean, was Deron into some kind of dirt?

04:00.991 --> 04:03.027
Cherise say he wasn't into anything wrong.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.404
So you talked to her?

04:04.495 --> 04:06.451
She was crying. She's scared, Mr. Batiste.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.828
Okay.

04:10.668 --> 04:14.832

04:39.780 --> 04:41.645
ALBERT: The Seb'm Ward.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.947
Nobody said "Seventh."

04:44.869 --> 04:47.702
Some called it Creoleville.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.165
But it was whites here and blacks, too.

04:50.249 --> 04:53.036

-This was before integration?
-Yeah.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.626
Before things blew up
and got pretty ugly in the '60s.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.587
I remember one day

05:06.682 --> 05:09.674
riding the Elysian Fields bus,
my father and me.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.929
We're sitting in the back behind a screen,

05:12.021 --> 05:15.434
had a sign that said "colored patrons only."

05:15.524 --> 05:16.513
Hmm.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.605
A white man we knew
named Richard Scordato,

05:21.739 --> 05:23.855
he owned an aquarium store,

05:24.950 --> 05:27.032
came back and sat with us.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.907
The driver said,

05:30.998 --> 05:35.412
"Richard, you know you can't
sit back there with them coloreds."

05:38.005 --> 05:40.496
Richard said, "They're my friends."

05:41.800 --> 05:45.509
Well, that driver
put us all off the bus that day.

05:45.596 --> 05:49.885
You see, it was a white man that did us wrong
and it was a white man that stood by us, too.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.933
And that's how it was around here back then.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.364
TONI: Mrs. Gilday?

06:11.455 --> 06:13.286
-Are you Mrs. Bernette?
-Yes, ma'am.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.114
-Come in.
-Thank you.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.122
That's not the house you were born in, is it?

06:19.797 --> 06:21.207
No.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.209
We lived in a shotgun double.

06:24.260 --> 06:28.378
My grandmam and my family on one side,
my aunts on the other.

06:29.348 --> 06:32.340
-We called it the Lambreaux Estate.
-(LAUGH|NG)

06:36.105 --> 06:42.897
Then my father and his brothers
built this here Creole shotgun for us.

06:43.904 --> 06:49.444
They were all carpenters,
bricklayers, tradesmen.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.240
And the day that it was finished,

06:54.331 --> 06:58.324
the priest came over from Epiphany
and put a branch on the roof.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.160
Christened it, like.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.415

07:08.387 --> 07:10.343

07:10.431 --> 07:13.173
I've been looking at the charges.

07:13.684 --> 07:16.016
Drunk in public.

07:16.729 --> 07:20.187
Did William typically consume much alcohol?

07:20.274 --> 07:23.607
Billy liked to have an occasional drink.

07:23.694 --> 07:28.279
And they put a resisting arrest charge
on top of the drunken charge.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.860
Battery of an officer.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.159
Said he bit the policeman
when he tried to put the cuffs on him.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.828
-Was he a violent person?
-No.

07:36.915 --> 07:40.123
Billy never swung on no one.
He sure wouldn't bite a man.

07:41.253 --> 07:47.544
A witness at OPP said
they saw Billy having trouble breathing.

07:48.093 --> 07:53.178
He had the asthma since he was a boy.
He kept an inhaler in his pocket all the time.

07:54.725 --> 07:58.138
But they took it from him, didn't they?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.809
Apparently, they did, Mrs. Gilday.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.354
Why didn't they help my boy
if he couldn't breathe?

08:02.441 --> 08:05.979
I don't knowjust yet.
But with your permission, I'd like to find out.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.897
Please.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.855
I need to dig deeper into this,

08:10.949 --> 08:16.239
but from what I know already,
I think we have the grounds for a lawsuit.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.615
What type of lawsuit?

08:17.706 --> 08:19.162
Wrongful death.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.204
You're gonna be our lawyer?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.499
If you'd like me to be, yes.

08:24.088 --> 08:28.502
There is something else
I need to discuss with you.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.547
l have a professional relationship
with a pathologist.

08:32.638 --> 08:35.675
He's actually the chief medical examiner
for the state of Georgia.

08:35.766 --> 08:37.631
One of the best there is.

08:37.726 --> 08:42.060
I think we should fly him down here and get
a second, independent autopsy on William.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.182
VVhy?

08:43.273 --> 08:48.609
This autopsy will assess
the level of suffering and degree of neglect

08:48.696 --> 08:52.063
that your son went through
on the night of his death.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.526
It's an expensive procedure,

08:57.621 --> 09:02.365
but we need to be absolutely certain
about the exact cause of death.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.960
It's the only way to find out the truth.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.377
We can't rely on the coroner's office.
Not in Orleans Parish.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.547
We'll find a way to cover the expense
if you recommend it.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.374
I do.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.460
What are we looking at?

09:16.348 --> 09:19.055
You're looking at an apartment building.

09:19.143 --> 09:23.102
I'm looking at a place me and my boys
used to call the Back Lot.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.181
It was a big old empty plot of land
with mounds of dirt.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.482
Grass weren't never cut.

09:28.569 --> 09:34.155
Me and my boys used to come here
and play Cowboys and Indians.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.902
War.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.904
About 10 of us from the neighborhood.

09:38.579 --> 09:42.743
-I don't mind telling you, I was the leader.
-Of course you were.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.825
This was our haven.

09:48.964 --> 09:54.675
In the middle there was a big old oak tree
like those they got up at City Park.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.674
We used to climb all over it.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.880
Right in the center of that tree,

09:58.974 --> 10:01.932
there was this big branch
that grew straight up to the sky

10:02.019 --> 10:04.852
with a crown at the top of it you could sit in.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.973
Up there, you had a view of the city.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.942
I felt like a young king.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.196
So, when'd they build
these apartments on the lot?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.453
I have no idea.

17:16.870 --> 17:20.112
But got a couple things holding me back.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.368
My father is sick for one.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.371
Got some bad news today,
so I'll be on an early flight in the morning.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.703
I'm sorry to hear that. My sympathies.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.503
But not everything's bad.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.707
About to be a father,
so don't want to be gone for that.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.962
-All right, now that's a blessing.
4ndeed.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.841
Well, look, think about it, Delmond.
The offer still stands.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.343
All right, we're ready to go, Terence.

17:39.434 --> 17:42.301
All right, all right. Cool. Let's go again.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.418

I'm never gonna leave this town

But he's smart.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.218
It's all in the contract
right there in teeny tiny type.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.146
In the event that Janette Desautel forfeits

19:09.232 --> 19:12.645
her managerial responsibilities
at Desautel's on the Avenue

or is terminated,

19:13.945 --> 19:19.360
then the Tim Feeny Restaurant Group retains
the exclusive right to the name Desautel.

19:20.076 --> 19:25.912
Further fucking more,
Janette Desautel forgoes the right

19:27.500 --> 19:29.331
to reuse the name Desautel

19:29.419 --> 19:31.660
on any subsequent restaurant ventures,
blah, blah, blah.

19:31.755 --> 19:32.710
Something like that.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.255
I can't remember the exact words.
Point is, it's in there.

19:36.343 --> 19:40.962
Scrotum-chinned fuck-void.

19:42.390 --> 19:47.430
I suppose I should have read the contract
a little more carefully before I signed it.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.138
But I was just so excited to get my own place.

Ma'am?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.029
Uh-huh.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.699
What about the menus?

20:12.796 --> 20:15.629
My name's in wide-screen.
I got to have them redone.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.211
-That's gonna be...
-Expensive?

20:19.302 --> 20:23.671
And redoing the sign out front,
that's gonna be a pisser, too.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.557
Always with the negative waves, Moriarty.

20:28.770 --> 20:32.262
And you're gonna have to
do something about yourjacket.

Oh, shit!

20:34.692 --> 20:35.681
(CHUCKLES)

20:36.236 --> 20:38.067
Just put some tape over it
or something like that.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.655
That would work.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.367
You know, I could help you with that.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.693
Tres galant, Davis.

I'm going home with you tonight.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.977
So, yeah, it was good.

21:28.663 --> 21:31.575
What's going on? Did I interrupt something?

21:32.542 --> 21:34.407
Daddy said he's not gonna
do any more treatments.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.458
I'm out.

It's his choice.

22:30.433 --> 22:34.221
If he does more treatments,
he could live longer.

I've seen people live longer
than what their doctors said they would.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.862
Doc Powell's a realist.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.692
Basically, he told our father
chemo's no longer a viable option.

22:49.786 --> 22:52.323
-That tells me something.
-Tells you what?

22:53.331 --> 22:55.617
-To give up hope?
-No.

start preparing for what's inevitable.

In fact, the in-house deaths have risen
since the changes were implemented.

I mean, what you got there
is kind of a self-assessment.

26:06.149 --> 26:09.266

areas for improvement,

Very conservative in our approach.

what's gonna happen over at Armstrong Park.

28:53.149 --> 28:55.731
The idea of a National Jazz Center
has been floating...

28:55.818 --> 28:56.807
Yeah.

28:56.903 --> 29:03.320
I'd have to study the,
you know, complexities of the concept.

Crunch the numbers.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.619

Yeah, I'm playing hard to get.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.314
Yeah, and you're good at it.

31:08.409 --> 31:11.196
-At least you could put a sign out front.
-I had one.

31:11.287 --> 31:16.077
They served me with a cease and desist on
the use of my name, so the sign came down.

31:21.922 --> 31:22.911
Sorry.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.371
Can he do that?

31:24.467 --> 31:27.004
Per my contract, yes.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.715
I'm gonna try to appeal to his human side.

31:31.515 --> 31:32.630
Maybe he'll relent.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.177
Hmm.

31:34.268 --> 31:38.557
Well, you still got a customer in me.
That hanger steak I had tonight? Damn.

How do you think I did tonight?

31:50.493 --> 31:53.485
Well, Liguori's pretty particular
with who he brings into the tent.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.116
What exactly is he looking for?

31:56.207 --> 31:59.950
Citizen liaison for the Jazz Center project.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.376
Go-to guy for the Treme
and Marigny neighborhoods.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.252
Oh. So I have a shot?

32:05.299 --> 32:07.381
I'm guessing Liguori's gonna
go in a different direction.

32:07.510 --> 32:08.499
Ah.

32:12.014 --> 32:15.757
Well, it was probably
not a big payday anyway.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.352
A couple grand.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.678
It was 30 grand.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.103

that it would help me immensely

37:09.144 --> 37:10.680
if I could use my name for my restaurant.

I mean, I'm not asking you
to take my name off the Avenue.

You have no legal standing to do so.
Or moral for that matter.

37:23.492 --> 37:26.279

thoroughly read the suit.

and you were cooking the food
you always wanted to,

37:58.402 --> 38:01.269

was not really your thing,

to the chain experience.

and spoke with Cherise two days ago.

Yeah, that's right. I was there.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.899
Was there anything said
that we should know about?

39:29.243 --> 39:34.454
Did she identify by name the ones
who shot Deron Williams in the drive-by?

39:34.540 --> 39:36.576
She talked to your people.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.032
So why are you asking me?

39:39.127 --> 39:41.209
We're hoping she might have confided in you.

39:43.799 --> 39:47.291
She said she didn't see anyone.
Cherise told the truth.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.090
She was a good girl.

39:58.313 --> 40:01.601
he had some long-time beefs
deep in the Iberville.

40:02.985 --> 40:05.897
On the day Deron was shot, he was wearing
one of his older brother's shirts.

40:05.988 --> 40:08.900
The shooters mistook Deron for the brother.

40:10.659 --> 40:11.899
Mistook?

40:14.329 --> 40:15.364
And Cherise?

40:15.455 --> 40:19.915
We're guessing they saw her as a threat,
that she might testify as a witness.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.588
I told her to mind herself.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.132
Where did this happen?

40:30.220 --> 40:33.678
She just dropped off her kid brother
at Wicker Elementary and was walking home.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.316

40:43.817 --> 40:45.432

we're gonna make an arrest.

-Danger, danger

45:36.109 --> 45:38.395
-You bet your life
-Danger, danger

45:38.486 --> 45:40.898
-She's a queen
-Danger, danger

45:40.989 --> 45:43.526
Really mean
Reach out for me now

45:48.496 --> 45:51.829
Rory Danger's rolling up
in a big black Cadillac

45:53.418 --> 45:57.127
She got a comb in her pocket
and a fully loaded tenor sax

45:58.465 --> 46:01.172
She got a bad attitude
and feeling rude

46:01.259 --> 46:03.591
Look out, boys
'Cause I'm coming through

46:03.678 --> 46:06.090
-She's got a knife
-Danger, danger

46:06.181 --> 46:07.296
You bet your life...

46:07.807 --> 46:09.638
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

46:09.726 --> 46:12.092
-What's happening, brah?
-How's it going, man?

46:12.187 --> 46:13.927
-What's going on?
-Where you at? Where you at?

46:14.022 --> 46:15.011
All right. All right.

46:16.608 --> 46:18.018
-Damn, Corey.
-Hey, what's up, man?

46:18.109 --> 46:19.974
What's going on, man?
You brought a lot of ammunition tonight.

46:20.070 --> 46:21.401
I thought it was a straight up Galactic gig.

46:21.488 --> 46:24.230
Yeah, man, we brought the Soul Rebels
so we could blow the back out the house.

46:24.324 --> 46:26.360
-All right.
-All right, let's do this.

46:26.451 --> 46:27.907
Yeah, man.

46:49.849 --> 46:53.467
(SINGING) Hairdresser, red dress
Looking like a girly mess

46:56.731 --> 47:00.690
You gonna see me on the ceiling
Every night with my Saints fans

47:00.777 --> 47:03.564
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

47:03.655 --> 47:07.898
There was a time when I was younger
and a little bit dumber, man

47:07.993 --> 47:10.826
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

47:11.454 --> 47:15.117
I got the power of the people
I'm the life of the party plans

47:15.250 --> 47:18.162
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

47:18.253 --> 47:20.414
-Say yeah
-Yeah

47:20.505 --> 47:22.166
-Yeah
-Yeah

47:22.257 --> 47:25.249
-Yeah
-Yeah

47:25.802 --> 47:29.420
Throw your hands in the sky
68 reasons why

47:29.681 --> 47:32.764
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

47:33.268 --> 47:34.849
Yeah

48:02.964 --> 48:05.922
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

48:06.009 --> 48:10.173
You see me busy rocking out
in the valley with a smile

48:10.346 --> 48:13.304
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

48:13.475 --> 48:17.593
We passed Old Liquor Bobby
in that Old Crocodile

48:17.687 --> 48:20.804
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

48:20.899 --> 48:24.858
So please believe me, baby
When I say it's been a while

48:24.944 --> 48:28.107
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

48:28.364 --> 48:32.152
It really don't take much
to make this grown man smile

48:32.243 --> 48:35.235
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

48:35.455 --> 48:37.195
-Say yeah
-Yeah

48:37.332 --> 48:39.288
-Yeah
-Yeah

48:39.375 --> 48:41.081
-Yeah
-Yeah

48:41.169 --> 48:43.455
-Yeah
-Yeah

48:43.922 --> 48:46.755
Throw your hands in the sky
68 reasons why

48:46.841 --> 48:50.129
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

48:50.220 --> 48:53.929
And one more for the lovers
who'll be staying up all night

48:54.015 --> 48:56.848
Hey-na-na-hey-na
Hey-na-na-hey

49:01.773 --> 49:05.516
-What street your daddy house on?
-Duels.

49:06.194 --> 49:07.775
Duels.

49:08.279 --> 49:12.989
-Had all those doubles and Creole shotguns.
-Yeah, I know that stretch.

49:14.202 --> 49:16.488
Sometimes the characters
from the Seventh Ward

49:16.579 --> 49:19.412
would pass in front of my house every day.

49:20.458 --> 49:23.575
White man we used to call Coupon Bread.

49:23.670 --> 49:26.628
-Coupon Bread?
-Looked like a boogeyman.

49:26.714 --> 49:27.703
(GIGGLES)

49:27.841 --> 49:30.924
And then there was Crazy Roy.

49:31.010 --> 49:32.261
He mooed like a cow.

49:32.345 --> 49:35.212
-Why'd he do that?
-Damn ifl know.

49:36.057 --> 49:37.297
Who else?

49:38.226 --> 49:39.386
Ragman.

49:41.312 --> 49:44.645
Had a mule-drawn wagon.

49:44.732 --> 49:48.190
Five and 10 cents, he'd buy up all your rags.

49:48.278 --> 49:49.984
Don't know what he did with them.

49:51.030 --> 49:52.645
Another mystery.

49:55.869 --> 49:57.405
You know how...

49:59.080 --> 50:01.412
You know how it is at dawn

50:02.584 --> 50:07.419
when you're half asleep, you're not too sure
if you're dreaming or you're awake?

50:08.590 --> 50:11.673
Once in a while, in moments like that,

50:13.136 --> 50:14.876
I hear my mother call my name.

50:18.641 --> 50:23.180
That's how you keep your loved ones
with you that have passed on.

50:25.607 --> 50:28.599
As long as you live, they're alive, too.

50:30.945 --> 50:32.355
What was your mama like?

50:33.615 --> 50:35.105
Tender, mostly.

50:37.035 --> 50:39.242
Strong when she needed to be.

50:40.747 --> 50:43.204
Why I like strong women, I suppose.

50:44.125 --> 50:45.160
And your daddy?

50:45.251 --> 50:47.583
-Carpenter.
-Wow.

50:48.630 --> 50:50.916
Arms hard as cedar.

50:51.549 --> 50:53.164
Amateur musician.

50:54.510 --> 50:56.125
Liked his drink.

50:58.181 --> 51:03.721
Sunday after mass,
he'd go over to Miss Rosa's Sweet Shop.

51:05.605 --> 51:09.143
It was a candy store during the week,
but on Sunday it was a bar.

51:09.317 --> 51:10.306
(CHUCKLES)

51:11.611 --> 51:12.600
And Lorraine?

51:14.781 --> 51:16.942
Now you want to know about my wife.

51:17.575 --> 51:18.906
Sure.

51:19.994 --> 51:21.985
She was a beauty.

51:23.248 --> 51:25.079
And feisty.

51:28.253 --> 51:30.744
Matter of fact, she was a lot like you.

51:35.051 --> 51:36.916
All those people gone.

51:38.513 --> 51:40.674
It's natural, I suppose.

51:42.850 --> 51:47.514
You get right down to it,
death is just an ordinary thing.

51:49.524 --> 51:50.604
Aren't you afraid?

51:52.360 --> 51:54.942
All sane men are afraid to die.

52:10.878 --> 52:12.414
You hear that?

52:13.381 --> 52:14.461
I don't hear anything.

52:14.924 --> 52:18.291
That noise.
I think it's coming from Honore's bedroom.

52:18.386 --> 52:22.880
Wasn't any noise. She's sleeping, Antoine.
She's fine.

52:22.974 --> 52:25.010
I'm gonna go check on her.

52:33.359 --> 52:34.565
Damn it.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.190
(VIBRATING)

53:09.270 --> 53:11.101
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

53:16.402 --> 53:17.778
JANETTE: That's not too bad, right?

53:18.279 --> 53:20.019
It'll be fine.

53:20.114 --> 53:21.945
Till we get new menus.

53:22.033 --> 53:24.194
Of course,
I have to come up with a name first.

53:24.285 --> 53:27.777
We should do it like a contest for the staff.
Like, a pool, you know?

53:29.499 --> 53:31.035
You got any ideas?

53:31.292 --> 53:32.748
Redacted?

53:33.419 --> 53:37.253
-Redacted on Dauphine.
-(LAUGHS) Better. I like that.

53:39.300 --> 53:41.712
You know what? I'm not gonna do this.

53:41.803 --> 53:45.466
We can handprint the menus
on some nice paper.

53:45.556 --> 53:48.298
-We'll change it every day if need be.
-I can do that.

53:48.393 --> 53:50.554
People know my name in this town.
They'll find us.

53:50.645 --> 53:52.886
They don't need to see my name on a menu.

53:52.980 --> 53:54.891
I mean, if they're here,
they know where they are.

54:03.366 --> 54:05.857
D'Andre, you forgot this.

54:08.287 --> 54:09.413
Hey.

54:09.997 --> 54:11.248
LaDonna.

54:13.251 --> 54:14.832
I see you got a new assistant.

54:15.711 --> 54:17.292
-I needed one.
-Yes, you did.

54:17.380 --> 54:19.587
Ain't nothing going on here and you know it.

54:19.674 --> 54:22.006
And even if there was,
you got no right to complain.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.128
You know where I stand, LaDonna.

54:23.219 --> 54:25.130
I'm waiting for you
to come to your damn senses.

54:25.221 --> 54:26.210
Yeah?

54:26.889 --> 54:27.878
What brings you here?

54:28.975 --> 54:31.182
For the boys from their father.

54:31.269 --> 54:32.884
I got them.

54:32.979 --> 54:35.095
Antoine wanted them to have it.

54:36.065 --> 54:37.100
Anything else?

54:37.191 --> 54:39.227
Yeah, I was hoping to catch them
while I'm here.

54:39.318 --> 54:41.229
Not home from the school yet.
You know their schedule.

54:41.988 --> 54:44.479
I was hoping to surprise them
when they did get here.

54:44.574 --> 54:46.781
It would be a surprise
if you were more engaged.

54:46.868 --> 54:49.701
-Okay, look, Larry.
-What?

54:49.787 --> 54:53.279
I'm thinking about taking my boys
back with me for a while.

54:53.374 --> 54:54.875
Take them where?

54:54.959 --> 54:57.120
-To the Residence Inn out in Metairie?
-Yeah.

54:57.211 --> 54:58.792
How they gonna get
back and forth from school?

54:58.880 --> 55:01.496
Or maybe you want them
to sleep over top of your bar

55:01.591 --> 55:03.832
if and when you finally finish
fixing that mess up.

55:03.926 --> 55:07.009
You want to take the boys?
What kind of bullshit is that?

55:08.973 --> 55:13.467
Look. The boys and I are
doing just fine for now.

55:13.561 --> 55:16.348
We got a routine and it works.

55:16.439 --> 55:19.977
Now, are you here to say that you want us
to be a family again under one roof?

55:20.067 --> 55:22.103
Because if you are, I'll listen.

55:22.653 --> 55:25.144
Tell them that I stopped by.

55:58.439 --> 56:00.555
And so we remember Cherise and Deron

56:00.650 --> 56:04.142
and the other students in this city
who are victims of violence this year.

56:04.237 --> 56:06.353
We're here to grieve and to heal.

56:06.447 --> 56:08.358
-Yes.
-STUDENTS: Yes.

56:08.449 --> 56:13.443
And also to start thinking very seriously
about how we can bring about change.

56:13.538 --> 56:14.618
STUDENTS: Yes.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.320
Jennifer.

56:19.126 --> 56:21.503
Cherise was my friend.

56:21.587 --> 56:25.375
She was a kind person
and loving to her little brother.

56:25.466 --> 56:27.457
CROWD: Yes, she was.

56:30.429 --> 56:32.886
We love this city, but it needs to love us back.

56:32.974 --> 56:34.510
Yes!

56:34.600 --> 56:37.262
JENNIFER: There's too much violence
and too much cruelty.

56:37.353 --> 56:39.309
CROWD: Too much! It has to stop.

56:40.648 --> 56:42.730
Cherise always saw the good in things.

56:43.234 --> 56:47.102
If she were here, she'd say let's work together
to make New Orleans better.

56:47.196 --> 56:49.437
-CROWD: That's right.
-And let's unite to keep the peace.

56:49.532 --> 56:51.568
CROWD: That's right! Amen!

56:52.952 --> 56:54.738
We should play something.

56:54.829 --> 56:58.663
Some of the other kids
brought their instruments, too.

56:58.749 --> 57:00.740
I don't think so, Robert.

57:01.752 --> 57:03.162
Not tonight.
