WEBVTT

00:07.799 --> 00:11.010
If this was Tehran,
I will rain hellfire upon them.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.972
A lot hinges
on whether we believe this is Iran

00:13.972 --> 00:15.515
or we believe it's someone else.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.351
When it's Hal,
you have to be really fucking sure.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.437
- You're getting divorced.
- No, we're not.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.439
The ambassador says your marriage is over.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.107
You ever been married?

00:24.107 --> 00:26.943
<i>There was a call
the day of the approach on a burner.</i>

00:26.943 --> 00:29.654
I called Niccolo. He called Shahin.
That's the whole story.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.572
- Is it?
- Yeah.

00:30.572 --> 00:34.451
My husband snuck out and called Iran?
And then lied to me about it?

00:34.451 --> 00:37.454
They kidnapped my husband
and called off a hit.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.457
The prime minister
has to stop saying it's Iran.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.000
It wasn't Iran.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.210
Ambassador,
Number 10 will walk back nothing.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.964
If you're concerned, I urge you
to speak with President Rayburn,

00:47.964 --> 00:50.759
who clearly has a great deal of influence
over the prime minister.

00:50.759 --> 00:55.013
As soon as this lunch is over,
get on some plane and not be here.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.890
You have so thoroughly fucked
with my head,

00:56.890 --> 01:00.852
I can't do the fucking job
if you are within a 100-mile radius.

01:00.852 --> 01:04.647
Katie, the vice president's gonna resign.
They want you to replace her.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.066
You can't be divorced.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.352
Thank you, guys.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.941
Ambassador Wyler.
More time with me than you ever wanted.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.193
And you. Like a bad fucking penny.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.111
- Welcome to Blighty, sir.
Yeah.

01:52.111 --> 01:53.071
Looking good.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.490
That's because
nobody lets me eat a carbohydrate.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.784
- Well, it's working.
- I'd rather be dead.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.792
Welcome, Mr. President.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.002
Ma'am. You got this.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.546
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.673
Mm-hm.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.301
Sharon? Where's the necessary?

02:15.301 --> 02:19.097
Pardon me. May I show you, Mr. President?
This way, sir.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.683
The PM is ten minutes out.
Great.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.352
Are we your first guests?

02:24.352 --> 02:25.895
We're a real nightmare.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.021
I just told her.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.232
- Now?
- Seemed the time.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.068
- Did it?
- May have been a miscalculation.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.947
- Welcome to Winfield.
You have time to think about it.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.242
You are on a short list.
Doesn't mean you're forced into anything.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.660
- I just told her.
- Just now.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.370
Really?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.539
Cancel the press avail.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.041
He can have lunch, no photos, and then...

02:48.293 --> 02:50.837
- Does she need to lie down?
-"Hellfire on Tehran"

02:50.837 --> 02:53.089
got Nicol Trowbridge
the bump of a lifetime.

02:53.089 --> 02:56.342
If he's standing next to the president,
he's gonna say it again.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.052
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Okay.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.013
Now, that's a nice powder room.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.222
Mr. President.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.809
The ambassador wants
to cancel the press avail.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.228
She's concerned
it'll look like an endorsement.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.647
Of a military strike on Tehran.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.649
I'm not sending him MiGs.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.067
His Navy got hit.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.278
I show up and stand next to the guy.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.906
Sir, you're gonna be
pinned like a butterfly

03:17.906 --> 03:21.784
- while the PM is quoting Leviticus.
- Maybe we don't take questions.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.871
- The visual is enough.
- The visual is also not okay.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.457
The British government
still thinks it's Iran.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.668
- Contrary evidence is having no impact.
Why would it?

03:31.252 --> 03:35.423
We've got pictures
of an Iranian boat leaving a port in Iran.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.635
- And what on the other side? Some guy?
- A compelling guy.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.888
They're not saying they're still
gathering facts. They're saying it's Iran.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.936
- It's not Iran.
- Because of the compelling guy?

03:47.936 --> 03:50.188
- Yes.
- Not sure you get out enough.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.105
Let's go.

03:52.607 --> 03:53.483
Hal?

03:53.483 --> 03:54.400
Sir...

03:55.985 --> 03:57.153
it's me.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.154
I'm the guy.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.198
They kidnapped me.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.617
So, first of all, it was a pull-aside.

04:02.617 --> 04:06.412
They kidnapped me and put me on the phone
with the deputy foreign minister of Iran.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.372
Fucking hell.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.416
He stuck his neck on the line
and his wife's and kids',

04:10.416 --> 04:12.001
of which there are five.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.127
They didn't do it.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.633
- Let me shake your damn hand.
- It's fine. He's a friend.

04:18.633 --> 04:22.679
- Not Iran. That's a fucking relief.
- It hasn't moved the Brits.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.140
- Tell them it was Hal Wyler.
- She did. She told the foreign secretary.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.934
- She told Dennison?
- Didn't move the needle.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.645
We should look at Russia
and Saudi Arabia

04:30.645 --> 04:32.647
and unexploded marine ordinance.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.775
- Trowbridge won't get off Iran.
- We should've canceled the trip.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.695
Kate asked the secretary of state
to cancel.

04:38.695 --> 04:43.283
- He wouldn't do it. He knew it was me.
- I swear, that man can hold a grudge.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.868
He thinks I'm the only reason
there's no peace in the Middle East.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.620
- It's not about that.
- I find it flattering.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.290
The secretary made a reasonable decision
in the moment.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.875
State and CIA
can't give unprocessed intelligence

04:52.875 --> 04:57.505
to a president at an inflection point.
That's gone badly for them in the past.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.800
Forty cameras are on their way
and the prime minister is off the rails.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.802
You can't stand next to the guy.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.348
Ambassador Wyler,
the prime minister is here.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.710
Don't know why
we don't do this more often.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.961
If I knew we could have you in

05:36.961 --> 05:39.756
and dispense with you an hour later,
we'd have done it all the time.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.716
- If I could have a quick word.
- Of course.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.384
Can you...?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.261
Gentlemen.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.266
Three courses.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.478
Light, but still, it's a lot.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.397
The press availability
might be gilding the lily.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.483
The press event is the lily.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.485
The president is uncomfortable
with the optics.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.488
The prime minister is uncomfortable
with 41 dead. Perhaps we call it square.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.364
He's had two days to shade that comment.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.284
Shading's not what brought Mr. Trowbridge
to Number 10.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.202
Anything.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.956
"I didn't mean hellfire on Tehran.
I meant hellfire on whoever.

06:13.956 --> 06:17.919
And we don't know who 'whoever' is,
but we are trying to figure it out."

06:17.919 --> 06:19.045
Oh, you're right.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.922
It has a ring.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.967
They can take candids of the lunch.

06:24.967 --> 06:28.638
Then it looks like a delegation of 12
come to scold the prime minister.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.474
How about a couch, conferring
in the sitting room after lunch?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.476
- No.
- They'd look like equals.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.771
He has a short torso
and looks like a troll on a couch.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.859
- If they were to dine, the two of them--
- Then it really looks like a scolding.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.486
Looks like everyone else was kicked out

06:43.486 --> 06:45.905
so my guy could whack your guy on the nose
with a newspaper.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.410
I think we should tuck in. Hm?
You must be starving.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.288
- They're still horse-trading.
- I'm producing sound.

06:54.288 --> 06:57.041
I'd always have a sandwich
before every state dinner.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.377
That way I wouldn't land at the table
like a rabid animal.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.878
That's not a terrible idea.

07:00.878 --> 07:01.796
Frances?

07:02.380 --> 07:03.214
Sir?

07:06.217 --> 07:08.553
- If it was just the two of them...
Yes?

07:08.553 --> 07:11.722
If. And if the president
is convinced it's not Iran--

07:11.722 --> 07:15.476
- That's not an if. He's convinced.
- I'd like to reach the end of my thought.

07:16.102 --> 07:16.936
Sorry.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.899
If the president
is convinced that it's not Iran,

07:21.899 --> 07:24.026
a lunch for two would provide him
with the opportunity

07:24.026 --> 07:26.696
- to persuade the prime minister.
- Exactly.

07:26.696 --> 07:31.159
To persuade him
that we're all served by a cooling.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.326
Yes.

07:32.326 --> 07:36.789
- Like I asked you to do yesterday.
- I'm not president of the United States.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.208
- On that, we agree.
- He's persuasive in a way I can't be.

07:39.208 --> 07:43.296
Especially if you don't try.
This is good. I think this is good. Yes?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.019
What if it was just the two of them?

07:58.019 --> 08:00.229
- And me.
- Or just the two of them.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.442
- William Rayburn, off script, no staff?
- I realize--

08:04.442 --> 08:06.736
Shooting the shit
with Nicol fucking Trickle?

08:06.736 --> 08:09.155
- The alternative is--
- It's a terrible idea.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.408
I've been floated for VP. There are
a lot of bad ideas on the table today.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.287
- Okay, so we're taking a breath.
- Know what?

08:16.287 --> 08:18.581
Maybe listening
to the evolution of the thought.

08:18.581 --> 08:22.793
It is an opportunity for Rayburn
to explain to Trowbridge slowly

08:22.793 --> 08:25.505
why a human source
on a well-established back channel

08:25.505 --> 08:29.342
is more compelling than a fuzzy drone shot
of an Iranian fast boat.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.928
I understand the thinking.
I just don't agree with it.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.514
It was the least bad idea, so I said yes.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.608
Thank you. Just the two.

08:46.359 --> 08:50.696
<i>He loved the English language.
He loved idiom. He loved the poetry of it.</i>

08:50.696 --> 08:52.990
<i>So I taught him a phrase a day.</i>

08:52.990 --> 08:55.451
The mission wraps.
I'm leaving Zagreb and I say:

08:55.451 --> 08:57.954
"Pasha, we've been like brothers,

08:57.954 --> 09:00.414
but from now on, we're not gonna see
so much of each other,

09:00.414 --> 09:03.543
just fleeting glimpses
like ships in the night."

09:03.543 --> 09:06.879
So the next day, we're at the palace,
he says to the president:

09:06.879 --> 09:08.464
"Hal Wyler is leaving us.

09:08.464 --> 09:12.593
We have been brothers,
but now we are only lambs in the dark."

09:13.761 --> 09:14.845
Lambs in the dark.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.473
-"Sheeps."
- In the night.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.058
Right? The man's a poet.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.434
Sheeps in the night.

09:20.434 --> 09:24.230
- On my best day, disoriented livestock.
- Right on the nose.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.524
- Katherine.
Oh, dear.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.278
He call you that when you've deployed
your schoolmarm glower?

09:31.862 --> 09:32.905
Lunch is served.

09:32.905 --> 09:33.948
Ah.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.283
At last.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.369
- I met John Gage. Do you know him?
Oh, no.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.662
He's a motherfucker.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.748
- Pardon me. He is a motherfucker.
- Yeah.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.002
- I'm beginning to get that impression.
- He was a neocon in '03.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.587
Now he's an isolationist.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.631
If you don't like his fundamental values,
wait five minutes.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.383
Prime minister.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.260
Oh, here we go.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.429
- This is a message of import.
- Of course.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.973
He has to drop the Iran thing.
He can't even say the word again.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.308
- Yeah.
- They didn't do it.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.475
- Yeah.
- Don't "yeah" me.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.728
People are throwing rocks
at the Iranian embassy.

10:03.728 --> 10:07.148
If we were home,
they could sidle up with an AR-15.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.359
Right, it's the perfect time
for American sanctimony.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.321
- Don't know why I bother.
I abandoned a drink.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.655
Perhaps a fresh one.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.408
No, for the good of the planet, waste not.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.953
Toss it out, and I'll have
radical <i>hausfrauen</i> torching my home.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.935
I'm so sorry, sir, your deputy is asking
if you can join him...

10:44.935 --> 10:47.647
Do you know the last time
he was alone in a room with anyone?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.273
- I don't.
I don't either.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.151
The secretary of defense
is gonna lose his shit. Find Leiber.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.780
You know, if you wanna have a talk
with the ambassador

10:55.780 --> 10:57.615
about the vice presidency...

10:58.699 --> 11:01.160
now is not a terrible time.

11:07.416 --> 11:12.505
Grace Penn recently learned her husband
misplaced a $6.3 million NIH grant.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.799
We tried to keep a lid on it,

11:14.799 --> 11:17.426
but some relentless ferret
from <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>

11:17.426 --> 11:19.512
is putting it together,
and when he does, she's done.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.641
The list of people
who can replace her is very short.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.769
It features
four identical-on-paper female legislators

11:26.769 --> 11:30.856
who'd all kill for the job and use it to
launch their own presidential campaigns.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.359
It's something
that makes the president extremely ornery.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.570
You're not cut out
for campaigning, clearly,

11:36.570 --> 11:41.117
but governing is something you've managed
to pull off under live artillery fire,

11:41.117 --> 11:44.245
which is not unlike a chat
with the U.S. Congress.

11:45.287 --> 11:49.041
It's entirely possible
that you could be a reasonable lieutenant

11:49.041 --> 11:52.795
to help a lame-duck legacy-build overseas,
which is the only way possible

11:52.795 --> 11:56.257
given the polarized deathmatch
that is today's Washington.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.761
That is the worst marriage proposal
I ever heard.

12:01.470 --> 12:05.391
Sorry. Ms. Park's looking for you.
Can you step out?

12:06.350 --> 12:07.184
I'd love to.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.442
Any idea why some CIA base
in ass-fuck northern Iraq

12:14.442 --> 12:17.736
is making NSA requests
about cell calls in London?

12:18.404 --> 12:19.613
I don't.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.033
- Did she ask you for an NSA search?
- No.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.369
Nothing about SIGINT? Or GCHQ?

12:25.369 --> 12:27.705
Can you just talk about
what you're talking about?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.752
A request was filed by Carole Langetti,

12:33.752 --> 12:37.339
a CIA analyst in Iraq
who worked with Kate Wyler in Baghdad.

12:37.923 --> 12:42.219
She put in an order for a signals
intelligence collection from GCHQ.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.804
- That's not normal?
- No.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.433
Why was the ambassador
14 inches up my ass about vetting a tip

12:47.433 --> 12:48.809
that came in through her husband?

12:48.809 --> 12:51.479
She just got here.
She wants to be careful.

12:51.479 --> 12:55.107
She ambushed the foreign secretary
yesterday. Is that careful?

12:56.358 --> 12:59.361
- It wasn't my favorite.
- Yeah. She's careful with my work.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.822
- But not her own.
- We do the same thing.

13:01.822 --> 13:05.826
All the time. We know people
in other countries, we ask for favors.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.372
You've got six months.
That's plenty of time.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.125
If the story breaks,
we don't have plenty of anything.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.231
Hi.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.195
Quite a day, huh?

13:46.408 --> 13:49.662
- Eidra would like to speak to you.
- Which one is that?

13:50.412 --> 13:51.247
CIA.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.041
When you're done.

14:00.798 --> 14:01.882
You knew.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.928
About the VP? Yeah.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.517
That she was leaving or that I was
on a shortlist to replace her?

14:13.561 --> 14:14.395
Both.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.902
Anyone else around here know more
about my life than I do?

14:22.861 --> 14:24.196
I don't think so.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.407
A handful in Washington.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.242
Five.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.786
Actual hand.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.899
It's been a busy few days
since you touched down.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.737
My introductory briefing
on the intelligence relationship

15:04.737 --> 15:07.907
between the U.S. and the UK
hasn't made it onto the schedule.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.410
- I'm sure we'll get there.
- The relationship is unique.

15:12.202 --> 15:16.165
We share almost everything.
More than with any other country.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.168
We don't spy on them,
they don't spy on us.

15:19.168 --> 15:23.380
MI6 and CIA share intelligence.
We run ops together.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.175
- Mm-hm.
- NSA and GCHQ share hardware.

15:27.426 --> 15:31.680
There's a traffic control system
for information the NSA swaps with GCHQ.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.641
It's called Sorting Hat.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.851
- Like from <i>Harry Potter.</i>
- Cute.

15:38.979 --> 15:43.233
When you request intelligence
from your friend in northern Iraq,

15:43.859 --> 15:47.780
and your friend orders a collection
from GCHQ about a target in London,

15:49.031 --> 15:52.493
MI6 gets an alert from the Sorting Hat.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.412
And then MI6 is confused,

15:55.412 --> 16:00.834
because when CIA London makes
a request of GCHQ, we tell them.

16:00.834 --> 16:05.339
So now MI6 wants to know
why I'm keeping things from them.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.051
Which is tough to answer.
Because of course there are,

16:09.051 --> 16:11.845
between ourselves,
a number of things I'm keeping from them.

16:11.845 --> 16:16.475
Managing them isn't easy. It's even
less easy when I don't know what they are.

16:18.143 --> 16:18.978
I'm sorry.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.525
- You should've come to me.
- I did.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.652
You acted like I was the nosy neighbor.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.279
- If you don't trust me enough to tell me--
- I trust you.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.489
I'm sure you don't.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.908
I don't trust my spouse.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.370
It's worse, right?

16:40.332 --> 16:43.252
- Wanna give me some context?
- I really don't.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.265
Hal contacted Shahin first.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.642
Not the other way around.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.185
He started it.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.066
He hates all the ideas.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.569
He liked Grace Penn.
Doesn't wanna be married to somebody else.

17:08.569 --> 17:12.614
But it's not gonna be nobody.
At some point, you gotta pick a horse.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.451
Yes. Go.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.286
What was that?

17:18.912 --> 17:19.788
Salt.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.752
- The president would like more of it.
- If he hears anything

17:26.128 --> 17:26.962
substantive...

17:28.839 --> 17:31.675
Sometimes the president
mutters something like, um,

17:31.675 --> 17:33.302
"Find out what bric-a-brac means."

17:34.303 --> 17:37.514
From country to country,
it can mean different things.

17:38.766 --> 17:39.683
Okay.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.685
I'm wasting my breath.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.856
- The vice presidency.
- I think you sold it.

17:45.856 --> 17:50.360
- It's supposed to sell itself.
- How about you try again with enthusiasm?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.863
- After this debacle?
- You said you wanted a doer.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.406
I changed my mind.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.616
Sir?

17:59.912 --> 18:03.332
The ambassador was hoping
you could join her and Ms. Park.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.500
In the library.

18:09.755 --> 18:13.175
Iran has moved an infantry battalion
from the Pakistan border to the coast.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.301
God.

18:17.179 --> 18:21.850
So it was one call to a contact in Italy,

18:21.850 --> 18:25.145
a nation that does have
diplomatic relations with Iran.

18:25.145 --> 18:29.608
I asked my contact
to tell Shahin that I was in London.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.278
Information he could have gotten
from a newspaper.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.905
But he didn't.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.616
You offered yourself up,
and then lied about it.

18:37.616 --> 18:41.161
She can't corroborate this
with anyone else. She has one source.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.580
This thing has legs
because of your reputation,

18:43.580 --> 18:46.500
and once you've established yourself
as a liar, liar, pants on fire,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.502
you undermine game-changing intelligence.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.879
So I'm the first guy ever

18:50.879 --> 18:53.590
to make clandestine contact
without reporting sources and methods?

18:53.590 --> 18:55.717
You aren't a member
of the clandestine services.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.846
- You don't work for the U.S. government.
- If this falls on friendly ears--

18:58.846 --> 19:00.430
But if someone wants to fuck with you,

19:00.430 --> 19:03.183
like the secretary of state
because he hates the fucking sight of you,

19:03.183 --> 19:06.478
it's a 951 violation,
and they can put you away for ten years.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.981
Even Ganon doesn't want me in jail
for ten years.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.941
- Yeah, but I do.
- You should go.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.280
- I'll stop.
We're okay without you.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.324
No, it's-- She's had a tough day.
Let her stay.

19:20.075 --> 19:24.496
Okay, this is new to me,
this both of you at the same time.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.373
I could use less of it.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.634
I'll stop. I'm sorry.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.221
The ambassador is correct.

19:41.221 --> 19:45.350
You making contact with Shahin first
changes the entire analysis.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.268
Yeah.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.438
Your story is the best tool we have
to de-escalate a situation

19:49.438 --> 19:51.565
that is quickly spinning out of control.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.525
It'd be great if it held water.

19:55.777 --> 19:56.778
Here to help.

19:56.778 --> 20:00.282
Write down every word of your conversation
with the deputy minister

20:00.282 --> 20:01.783
and his interlocutor.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.870
He was an assassin. The interlocutor.

20:05.829 --> 20:06.914
On the paper.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.750
- You don't wanna just talk and record it?
- I don't.

20:13.045 --> 20:13.879
Okay.

20:34.650 --> 20:38.487
You tried to tell me yesterday.
A bunch of times.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.113
Yeah.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.741
I'm really sorry.

20:52.876 --> 20:55.212
Ma'am, coffee has been served
to the gentlemen.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.296
Okay.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.850
...step up UAV surveillance...

21:09.768 --> 21:10.978
They're wrapping up.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.397
I'll have the defense secretary
give you a call.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.439
Okay, thank you.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.571
- They're on coffee. Won't be long.
- Mm-hm. Tea, right?

21:22.614 --> 21:26.118
Uh, they serve coffee. It's not great.
But if you ask...

21:26.118 --> 21:27.744
- Did he?
- Who?

21:28.453 --> 21:32.332
- Did the president order coffee?
- I don't know. She served coffee.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.543
- Motherfucker. Andrew!
- What's wrong?

21:34.543 --> 21:36.878
He can't have coffee.
It sets his heart in A-fib.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.797
He fucking sneaks it. Coffee.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.134
- Should we get--?
What did I tell you?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.969
- Sir, put it down!
- You see?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.888
- That's extraordinary.
- Isn't it?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.184
It's tea.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.437
Unbelievable.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.481
My cardiologist is sure
I'm gonna die on his watch.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.901
- The list of things I can't ingest.
- This one is serious.

21:59.901 --> 22:04.489
I ordered a cup of coffee in Madrid,
it came in this 400-year-old porcelain,

22:04.489 --> 22:07.576
which they had pilfered
from the Chinese in 1882.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.495
He batted it out of my hand.
It hit the ground, turned to dust.

22:10.495 --> 22:15.292
Incredible. I can't get a rise out of my
lot unless I strike a child with my car.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.921
- I only do it because I love you.
- I don't want your love.

22:19.921 --> 22:22.215
Tehran has sent an infantry battalion
to the coast.

22:22.215 --> 22:25.093
He'll back off Iran
once his guys are out of there.

22:25.093 --> 22:28.347
We're gonna send a carrier group
to the Gulf, give them a ride to Bahrain.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.723
His ship is sinking.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.476
There it is. See?
- What am I looking at?

22:33.101 --> 22:34.561
The hags tell the Scottish king,

22:34.561 --> 22:39.191
"You shall ne'er be vanquished till
Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane." <i>Macbeth.</i>

22:39.191 --> 22:40.317
The play.

22:40.317 --> 22:44.321
Some sneaky Winfield groundskeeper knew
Barbara Hutton loved the Scottish play,

22:44.321 --> 22:48.950
so he lopped a cutting off the last
Birnam Oak and planted it in the garden.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.998
Did he say "sinking"?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.709
- It's sinking?
- Sorry?

22:57.709 --> 23:00.295
The president said he's sending
a carrier group to the Gulf

23:00.295 --> 23:02.464
to rescue your crew before they drown.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.759
How do you not tell me
the ship is sinking?

23:08.345 --> 23:09.971
Because it isn't.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.267
Where can we speak privately?

23:14.810 --> 23:17.270
- Ah, we could go in--
Not in the house.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.565
- Walls are pretty thick.
- Not... in the house.

23:20.565 --> 23:24.152
- Is it bugged?
- Can we choose an outdoor venue?

23:24.152 --> 23:27.614
I moved in five minutes ago.
I haven't scouted the grounds.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.617
- What's that over there?
- The garden?

23:30.617 --> 23:32.410
- Yes.
- It looks like a garden.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.371
Okay. Let's meet on the other side of it.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.541
You go that way,
I'll cut through the house.

24:04.568 --> 24:08.738
A couple M48 Patton tanks
outfitted with Russian smoothbore guns.

24:09.865 --> 24:14.369
I'm so sorry to interrupt, ma'am.
Could I--? Just for a moment?

24:18.665 --> 24:23.545
Ambassador Wyler asked if you'd ask the
secretary of defense for a keel report.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.838
From the carrier.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.132
- A keel report.
- Yes. Thank you.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.344
And it's an honor to meet you.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.639
What the hell is a keel report?

24:39.102 --> 24:41.188
The carrier is taking on water,

24:41.188 --> 24:44.357
which is not unexpected
given the yawning gash in its hull.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.903
HMS <i>Courageous</i> is designed to take fire,

24:47.903 --> 24:51.698
seal off the debilitated compartment,
and remain afloat.

24:51.698 --> 24:53.742
Why does the president think it's sinking?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.744
Presumably someone told him.

24:56.912 --> 24:57.746
Because...?

24:59.289 --> 25:02.834
What did the president pledge to send
on this rescue mission?

25:03.627 --> 25:04.753
A carrier group.

25:06.671 --> 25:07.631
Warships.

25:09.007 --> 25:12.135
Had the prime minister asked
for an American show of force in the Gulf,

25:12.135 --> 25:13.470
the president would have refused

25:13.470 --> 25:17.724
because it could launch both our countries
into a catastrophic regional conflict.

25:18.725 --> 25:19.851
But a distress call...

25:19.851 --> 25:23.230
He's luring a strike force
into the Persian Gulf.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.898
- Yes, he is.
- And you're okay with that?

25:24.898 --> 25:28.735
- What suggests I'm okay with this?
- Tell him to fucking stop it!

25:28.735 --> 25:30.862
What do you think I've been doing
for three years?

25:30.862 --> 25:33.323
Telling Nicol Trowbridge
to fucking stop it!

25:35.659 --> 25:38.745
I begged you to have Rayburn intervene.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.205
You-- When?

25:40.205 --> 25:42.457
Yesterday. And today.

25:42.457 --> 25:44.084
You didn't.

25:44.084 --> 25:48.546
Uh, "If the president could share
his perspective, his wisdom

25:48.546 --> 25:51.508
- with the PM, perhaps--"
- That's what begging looks like to you?

25:51.508 --> 25:55.220
- I didn't drop to my knees.
- If the house is on fire, tell me.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.597
The house is on fire!

26:05.188 --> 26:09.776
You know, Iran is the best thing
that ever happened to Nicol Trowbridge.

26:09.776 --> 26:13.238
- Iran didn't happen to him.
- Does that matter?

26:13.238 --> 26:14.406
Did you tell him?

26:14.406 --> 26:17.242
About your husband's tale?
Of course I did.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.870
If you call it a tale,
it kind of undermines the intelligence.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.707
He believes
Mr. Wyler provided interesting evidence,

26:23.707 --> 26:26.918
but not incontrovertible
and nowhere near actionable.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.878
We have to stop trying
to prove a negative.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.339
We need to figure out who it was,
not who it wasn't.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.382
What an insight.

26:32.382 --> 26:36.886
I mean, really like a bolt
from the heavens.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.264
You're kind of an asshole.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.059
Something about your charmingly foul mouth

26:43.059 --> 26:46.604
makes me feel like
you appreciate the unvarnished.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.525
Are you saying that you like me?

26:52.527 --> 26:55.030
I'm saying that I would like to trust you.

26:58.658 --> 27:01.161
I thought I could manage this,
but I can't.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.714
What?

27:13.923 --> 27:16.968
I drank the Kool-Aid,
like a fucking child.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.348
The husband.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.390
Ah.

27:23.016 --> 27:23.975
Was it bullshit?

27:23.975 --> 27:26.603
No. It was incomplete.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.271
And she tried to warn me.

27:28.897 --> 27:32.984
- Well, look, even you can make mis--
- No, this is not a small mistake.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.199
By the way,
I asked you to come to Cairo...

27:39.949 --> 27:41.534
It's a terrible idea.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.537
Being a tandem couple
has fucked both of them.

27:44.537 --> 27:45.538
But mostly her.

27:46.247 --> 27:48.083
- Well, how?
- He lies to her,

27:48.083 --> 27:50.377
regularly enough that she expects it.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.795
It's fucked her career.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.381
Well, I think her career's going okay.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.633
She doesn't wanna be here.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.803
Why is she here? She's frontline material.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.056
Yeah. Exactly.

28:03.681 --> 28:06.101
Ma'am? Could you join the ambassador?

28:06.101 --> 28:07.352
Of course.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.605
No concrete intel on Riyadh...

28:19.614 --> 28:21.241
We can't afford to piss them off,

28:21.241 --> 28:24.619
but at this point, there isn't
a credible threat to our interests.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.956
In the meantime, what's
the secretary of defense saying?

28:27.956 --> 28:30.250
I asked. Says it's time-sensitive.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.420
Find me when NSA weighs in.

28:33.420 --> 28:37.465
We have to come to some agreement
with the Saudis not to make this worse.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.053
Were you able to get the report?
Keel report.

28:42.053 --> 28:44.973
- Still working on it.
- Can we--? For a minute?

28:58.361 --> 29:00.363
Rayburn can't send ships to the Gulf.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.699
Trowbridge played him.
He lied to his face.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.702
He wants the visual
of American warships buzzing Iran.

29:05.702 --> 29:09.330
- The aircraft carrier is not sinking.
- How do you know that?

29:09.330 --> 29:13.710
I'd know for sure if I had a keel report,
but I have it on very good authority.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.044
Shit.

29:15.044 --> 29:19.299
We're getting flares from the Brits.
They can't shut Trowbridge down.

29:19.841 --> 29:23.261
The president needs to say
our ships can't get there in time to help.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.013
He won't renege on a rescue mission.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.266
This is a distress call
coming from a senior government official.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.434
Named what?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.020
We can't do anything.

29:32.020 --> 29:36.816
When we had a dangerous head of state,
we relied on our allies to respond

29:36.816 --> 29:38.818
when we made distress calls.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.116
You know why I didn't want this job?

29:45.116 --> 29:48.369
I spent a decade
building a reputation in a community

29:48.369 --> 29:52.791
such that when I say something,
people fucking listen to me.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.210
- I have none of that here.
- Not none.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.088
Not none.

30:04.052 --> 30:08.640
The prime minister is setting the stage
for an attack on American hardware

30:08.640 --> 30:09.933
and American troops.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.769
He wants this to be our problem
as much as his.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.563
We need to talk to that source.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.689
- Shahin?
- If we have to.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.191
- You talked to...?
- Yeah.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.151
You wanna go back to Shahin?

30:20.151 --> 30:23.196
If you think the president should renege,
we need more to bring to the Brits.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.448
You can't. It's too dangerous.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.283
That's a Birnam Oak.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.119
From Shakespeare.

30:30.829 --> 30:31.746
Go take a look.

30:31.746 --> 30:32.789
We will.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.417
It's Iran's backyard.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.336
If we wanna know who did this,

30:38.336 --> 30:40.421
they'll have better intelligence
than anyone.

30:40.421 --> 30:43.383
Shahin's own regime will go after him.
He will be killed.

30:43.383 --> 30:47.053
If we go to war with Iran,
a lot of people will be killed.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.931
Shahin wants to modernize his country.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.058
He's one of the only people in the regime

30:52.058 --> 30:55.395
who gets along with the reformists
and the military and the mullahs,

30:55.395 --> 30:59.065
because his father rode bikes
with the supreme leader when they were 10.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.985
And inexplicably, he doesn't believe
we're the great Satan.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.404
- I understand he's valuable.
- You don't.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.865
An Iran Deal can be revoked.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.782
Clearly.

31:08.324 --> 31:12.287
What we're really doing when we
negotiate with them, or with anyone,

31:12.287 --> 31:17.041
is looking for one or two friends we can
call when the world is truly fucked.

31:17.584 --> 31:21.004
It is a flimsy web of relationships.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.463
But sometimes it holds.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.424
Do not tear it.

31:25.008 --> 31:28.261
Do not be an infinitely ravenous American.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.179
Use what he already gave you.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.058
Danny?

31:34.851 --> 31:38.646
Get me Stuart Hayford.
Can we get the president out of the woods?

31:40.523 --> 31:43.151
- Tell Langley to go at it another way.
- Okay.

31:45.820 --> 31:46.946
I need a drink.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.937
- That was moving.
- What?

32:19.646 --> 32:20.521
A spiderweb.

32:21.397 --> 32:24.943
You gotta have a couple of those in
your pocket when things get existential.

32:24.943 --> 32:25.860
Yeah.

32:27.487 --> 32:28.696
We're waiting for someone.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.455
- We doing this?
- Maybe.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.669
I sent you here to be with him.

32:42.669 --> 32:46.339
For a lot of reasons,
but he's checking you out.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.510
That's creepy.

32:51.469 --> 32:55.431
Five U.S. presidents were
formerly ambassadors to this country.

32:55.431 --> 32:59.310
It's the right place to learn.
You'd melt on a campaign trail.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.063
You'd call your donors corrupt
to their faces.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.732
But there's no campaign.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.945
Imagine if your... frankness

33:09.612 --> 33:11.280
were actually a plus,

33:11.280 --> 33:15.493
if your only goal was to keep
the president relentlessly on track.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.371
The president needs someone to stop him

33:18.371 --> 33:19.831
from rambling about chicken tariffs

33:19.831 --> 33:21.541
when he needs an arms deal.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.753
The VP spends more time in the Oval
than anyone who doesn't have a desk there.

33:25.753 --> 33:29.632
- First in, last out of every meeting.
- Guys...

33:30.425 --> 33:33.344
- You wanna know why you're on the list?
- Uh, I have a uterus.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.388
That's not-- Not the only reason.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.807
You spent seven years building a ticket

33:37.807 --> 33:41.227
where an elderly guy could
hand the baton to an electable woman

33:41.227 --> 33:44.439
and deliver us the first female president.

33:45.189 --> 33:49.152
Now you want someone with
no voting record, no baggage, no opinions.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.572
Clean me up, put me in a dress,
and hope I never speak.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.449
Yeah. I had a plan.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.659
Turned to shit.

33:56.659 --> 34:01.080
But as far as rebounds go,
you don't have to survive a campaign.

34:01.080 --> 34:04.250
We air-drop you in to govern,
maybe you catch fire.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.002
She thinks you'd be good at the job.

34:06.002 --> 34:09.964
I called nine people and said,
"If it looks like the apocalypse is now,

34:09.964 --> 34:11.424
who's your first hire?"

34:12.216 --> 34:13.259
Five said you.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.970
What you did in Lebanon.

34:16.971 --> 34:19.807
What I'm not supposed to know
you did in Baghdad.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.603
Makes a great poster.
"Iraq. Could have been worse."

34:23.603 --> 34:26.522
No campaign. No posters.

34:27.648 --> 34:30.151
We'd put you in the lead
on foreign policy.

34:30.151 --> 34:33.446
You get the Middle East. You can deal
with Russia without freaking out.

34:33.446 --> 34:34.864
You know cobalt is the only thing

34:34.864 --> 34:37.158
we're really gonna be talking about
for the next 25 years.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.452
You'd be doing it for the country,
not the power.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.079
If I'd thought about it,

34:41.079 --> 34:42.705
- I'd have planned it this way.
- Mm-hm.

34:43.831 --> 34:47.710
Really. It's almost embarrassing.
Never even occurred to me.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.962
Pick someone good at the job,
not the interview?

34:49.962 --> 34:54.717
I mean, it's bad for the guys,
but for the women? Fuck me.

34:54.717 --> 34:58.679
Is she pretty but not too pretty?
Appealing but not hot?

34:59.597 --> 35:02.683
Confident but not bitchy?
Decisive but not bitchy?

35:02.683 --> 35:04.727
Cute bitchy, but not "bitchy" bitchy.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.107
We had to come to an agreement

35:09.107 --> 35:11.400
about how many days a week
the VP would wear a thong.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.821
She doesn't like them.
Her team doesn't like panty lines.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.698
Weeks of my life.

35:17.698 --> 35:20.952
And then an agreement.
Yes, she will wear ass-floss,

35:20.952 --> 35:24.664
but only two days out of seven,
and days cannot be banked week to week.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.085
Can you imagine hiring someone
for a key governing position

35:29.085 --> 35:30.837
just because you think
they'd be good at it?

35:36.843 --> 35:40.054
Don't say anything.
She's actually thinking about it.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.430
- Are you?
- Shh.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.058
Are you?

35:48.062 --> 35:49.063
That's progress.

35:53.693 --> 35:57.155
Give it time. When Hal and I first spoke,
it sounded ridiculous,

35:57.155 --> 36:00.533
but a month later...
it seems kind of brilliant.

36:03.369 --> 36:06.289
Ma'am, he's asking for you.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.050
A month?

36:20.386 --> 36:21.512
Listen-- Let--

36:22.221 --> 36:23.764
Let me just tell you how--

36:28.811 --> 36:31.022
Kate. Kate.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.403
Kate. Katie.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.322
Kate, stop.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.698
I'm going for a walk.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.867
- Can I come?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.996
- When Billie called me--
- She called you a month ago.

36:46.996 --> 36:50.416
Yeah, and at that point,
it was talk, that's all.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.919
She wanted advice, the Grace Penn thing--

36:52.919 --> 36:54.545
- The vice president.
- Yeah.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.964
You should call her the vice president.

36:56.964 --> 36:59.592
The issue with the vice president
and her husband,

36:59.592 --> 37:04.055
and the $6 million NIH grant
that went missing had just surfaced.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.806
So Billie called you.

37:05.806 --> 37:09.435
Uh, yeah. As a friend of the--
Friend of the court.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.479
At that point, she wanted the VP to stay.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.522
She was just trying out ideas
for damage control.

37:13.522 --> 37:18.778
So the notion that the vice president
might be replaced didn't come up.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.863
We tossed around a couple names.

37:20.863 --> 37:21.989
Including mine?

37:21.989 --> 37:25.409
- Who else, your mom?
- There aren't a lot of names, Katie.

37:25.409 --> 37:28.079
I mean, they need a woman.
They need someone clean.

37:28.829 --> 37:32.166
Abby Shotkin's too old.
Stella can't keep her mouth shut.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.711
He promised the first lady
he wouldn't pick Rachel Beer,

37:35.711 --> 37:37.338
'cause he fucked Rachel Beer in college,

37:37.338 --> 37:40.591
and he told his wife she wasn't the best
lay of his life, Rachel Beer was.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.177
And if he picks Laurie Davis,
we lose the House.

37:43.177 --> 37:46.180
Okay, so at that point, someone says...

37:47.014 --> 37:47.848
You.

37:48.432 --> 37:49.267
Who says me?

37:50.101 --> 37:54.438
Uh, me, Billie, I can't remember.
It wasn't a plan. We were spitballing.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.233
You were on your way to Kabul.
You weren't ready for prime time.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.818
It wasn't realistic.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.069
Definitely not.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.072
- But now...?
- Well, once the London thing happened,

38:03.072 --> 38:05.783
it was like, maybe she could spend
six months in a more public post,

38:05.783 --> 38:09.287
get your sea legs,
get used to the spotlight, you know.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.247
So at that point, you called Billie.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.957
- Billie called me.
- Like Shahin did?

38:12.957 --> 38:16.961
- Katie, Billie called me.
- Was there a point at which you thought

38:16.961 --> 38:18.754
I should come into this conversation?

38:18.754 --> 38:21.299
What would you have said? I'm serious.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.218
One month ago, on your way to Kabul,

38:24.218 --> 38:27.638
would I have got halfway through
the sentence trying to pitch this to you?

38:29.181 --> 38:30.474
Fair. That is a fair point.

38:31.017 --> 38:34.770
- So the London thing happens.
- Yeah. And it didn't matter.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.189
This place is a shit show.
VP or no, it's good you're here.

38:37.189 --> 38:39.108
We figured, you know...

38:39.942 --> 38:41.736
- What? What did you figure?
- Well...

38:42.862 --> 38:46.282
Listen, I was trying
to find the right time to tell you.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.199
And...

38:48.743 --> 38:49.577
I--

38:50.703 --> 38:51.912
I didn't find it.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.499
Now, two weeks ago--

38:55.499 --> 38:59.253
- I swear to fucking God.
- Two weeks ago you said, "Call Rick."

39:05.051 --> 39:05.885
Yeah.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.471
- And I...
- You called Rick.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.097
- I did.
- Katherine.

39:11.223 --> 39:14.602
You know the chessboard,
you are undaunted by complexity--

39:14.602 --> 39:16.062
I called our attorney.

39:16.062 --> 39:20.107
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to get someone into the White House

39:20.107 --> 39:23.319
with a preternatural ability
to un-fuck clusterfucks.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.696
I called Rick and said,
"Get us a mediator.

39:25.696 --> 39:30.659
Because this is gonna be the cleanest,
loveliest divorce anybody ever had."

39:30.659 --> 39:32.161
You have an orchard.

39:32.161 --> 39:35.122
The president of the United States
is in it.

39:35.122 --> 39:39.293
You need to have a conversation with him.
Hear what he's thinking.

39:39.293 --> 39:44.298
You need to, in a chill way,
get to know the guy before he leaves,

39:44.298 --> 39:46.801
- which is in ten minutes.
- You didn't tell me a lot of things.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.761
- Katie--
- You had your reasons. It's okay.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.930
But when you said...

39:51.847 --> 39:54.767
-"Yes, we can be done..."
- Yeah.

39:54.767 --> 40:00.106
"...we had ten good years, we're done,"
you were crying.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.649
There was snot.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.818
Kate, it's the vice presidency.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.903
- You want me to think about it, right?
- Yeah, I do.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.405
- Can you?
- Yeah.

40:08.572 --> 40:09.573
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:10.908 --> 40:13.869
- Katie--
- If you answer one question, truthfully.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.288
Really truthfully.

40:16.288 --> 40:19.083
Sure, okay. Yeah, anything.

40:21.335 --> 40:25.589
When you said, "Call Rick,"
when you said, "We're done,"

40:27.216 --> 40:28.843
did you think we were done?

40:37.101 --> 40:37.935
No.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.399
What the fuck?

40:47.820 --> 40:50.114
Kate. Kate, take a breath--

40:50.114 --> 40:52.324
Jesus!

40:52.324 --> 40:53.993
- Fuck.
Shit!

40:53.993 --> 40:55.411
What the fuck? Kate!

40:55.411 --> 40:56.620
Jesus.

41:03.419 --> 41:07.173
- You are killing me!
Huh.

41:07.173 --> 41:10.176
- Thoughts?
- We're not his detail. We're hers.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.052
Not going well for him, is it?

41:13.971 --> 41:16.056
Kate.

41:16.056 --> 41:20.102
- Kate, put it down.
- Shit. Stop. No!

41:20.102 --> 41:23.063
- Fuck! You fucking shit!
- I swear to God--

41:23.063 --> 41:25.691
Fucking-- Kate. Ow! Stop.

41:26.609 --> 41:27.902
Okay. Okay.

41:35.868 --> 41:38.913
- This marriage is...
- Jesus! Kate, stop!

41:38.913 --> 41:40.247
...killing me!

41:40.247 --> 41:43.667
- You are killing me!
- Yeah, I'm trying, it's not working.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.753
- Fucking shit!
Ma'am?

41:47.796 --> 41:50.132
The chief of staff
would like you to speak to the president.

41:57.848 --> 42:00.809
- What the fuck happened?
- I tripped. Where's the president?

42:00.809 --> 42:03.062
- Forget it.
She can change.

42:03.687 --> 42:04.688
Her clothes.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.066
President's not budging on the ships.
It's a rescue mission.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.276
I thought maybe you could turn him around,

42:09.276 --> 42:11.070
- but this isn't gonna--
No.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.781
- This is perfect.
- Kate.

42:21.664 --> 42:22.706
Okay.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.627
Is she gonna be okay?

42:27.920 --> 42:28.754
I don't know.

42:46.146 --> 42:48.107
They could've rerouted to Diego Garcia.

42:48.107 --> 42:51.610
Everybody wants to know why I didn't
warn them we were going after the tanker.

42:53.445 --> 42:54.446
Give me a minute.

43:03.122 --> 43:06.083
Marla Dane has a lot of experience.

43:06.083 --> 43:09.878
She took a year off to take care
of her dying mother who is now dead.

43:09.878 --> 43:11.672
- So--
- She's available.

43:11.672 --> 43:14.550
She can be ambassador.
She will love this...

43:15.634 --> 43:17.678
whatever this is on the walls.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.015
And she's the one you want
for the other thing too.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.141
Where are you going?

43:22.975 --> 43:25.603
I am not cut out for this.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.313
I'm stepping down.

43:27.313 --> 43:31.358
Good news is,
that makes me the one person in the world

43:31.358 --> 43:36.905
who isn't trying to kiss your ass,
but still knows a lot about Iran.

43:43.412 --> 43:45.789
A man named Saman Karimi

43:45.789 --> 43:49.126
was removed from the command
of a Quds Force unit in Syria

43:49.126 --> 43:52.588
when even Bashar al-Assad said
he was a guy who took things too far.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.966
- But you can't fire a Saman Karimi.
- No.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.803
So they gave him command
of a Fishing Industry Safety Regiment.

43:59.803 --> 44:03.432
Complete with 14 boats and a lot of RPGs.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.559
You think
they're gonna swarm the Fifth Fleet?

44:05.559 --> 44:08.312
I think they're gonna load an RPG
onto a fishing trawler

44:08.312 --> 44:10.314
and see what they can hit.

44:12.232 --> 44:15.027
A couple of Americans die,
and then we're in it.

44:16.153 --> 44:17.571
Not rescuers.

44:17.571 --> 44:18.906
Combatants.

44:19.782 --> 44:22.201
- I told Billie--
- You told her Russia's watching?

44:22.201 --> 44:24.453
That everyone's watching?
That it's a litmus test?

44:24.453 --> 44:25.579
Because it is.

44:25.579 --> 44:26.705
Of course it is.

44:26.705 --> 44:30.709
The minute Russia savaged Ukraine,
every NATO state's been waiting to see

44:30.709 --> 44:34.630
if I meant it when I said,
"An attack on one is an attack on all."

44:34.630 --> 44:36.048
One just got attacked.

44:36.048 --> 44:38.425
This is not the straw
that will break the alliance.

44:38.425 --> 44:41.428
Why not? An alliance is nothing.

44:41.428 --> 44:45.432
It's a pinkie promise like I made
with Jason Slavick when I was 10.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.810
-"You get hit, I show up."
- You're here.

44:48.602 --> 44:50.604
In this case,
I show up with a carrier group.

44:50.604 --> 44:52.189
Or judgment.

44:54.108 --> 44:58.570
Fifty thousand British soldiers marched
on Baghdad because we asked them to.

44:59.071 --> 45:00.280
And we chased that with an era

45:00.280 --> 45:02.950
defined by a profound lack of interest
in anybody but ourselves.

45:02.950 --> 45:07.621
Sir, you're not doing this
to restore our reputation in the world.

45:09.081 --> 45:11.500
This ought to be good. Why am I doing it?

45:11.500 --> 45:14.545
You're scared your enemies think
you're too old and frail

45:14.545 --> 45:16.505
to put Americans in the line of fire.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.426
Do people like you?

45:21.927 --> 45:23.512
You're right to worry about it.

45:24.054 --> 45:30.185
That smug Brazilian guy who kept offering
you pee breaks every 15 minutes at the G20

45:30.185 --> 45:35.190
revived all the rumors about incontinence
your team spent six months trying to kill.

45:35.190 --> 45:39.236
And it's not nothing, particularly when
you're dealing with Russia and China.

45:39.236 --> 45:42.614
Any leader who looks at you
and sees his own age,

45:43.240 --> 45:45.409
it makes them wanna crush you.

45:45.993 --> 45:48.912
But that is like 49 percent disastrous.

45:48.912 --> 45:52.166
And potential for war with Iran is 51.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.501
Which means I win by two.

45:57.754 --> 45:59.256
A wise man once said,

46:00.048 --> 46:04.303
"Decisions don't get to the desk
of the president unless they're 49-51.

46:04.303 --> 46:09.099
I spend my days splitting hairs,
but that's the job I raised my hand for."

46:09.933 --> 46:11.059
I said that.

46:11.059 --> 46:12.060
Did you?

46:13.520 --> 46:16.607
I thought you were the only one
in the world who wasn't kissing my ass.

46:19.276 --> 46:20.110
Billie.

46:23.655 --> 46:26.366
- President would like the chief of staff.
- I'm here. His voice carries.

46:26.366 --> 46:29.453
- How are we doing?
No ships. Bring the car around.

46:29.453 --> 46:30.913
We're wheels up in two.

46:30.913 --> 46:34.041
Give me more on "no ships."
- She wins, I lose.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.877
And someone should wash her.
She looks ridiculous.

46:37.794 --> 46:39.171
Find the secretary of defense.

46:39.171 --> 46:40.756
Tell him no ships go to the Gulf.

46:40.756 --> 46:44.051
Make sure he doesn't fly back with me.
He's gonna be a real turd about this.

46:44.051 --> 46:47.054
I need a car for the secretary of defense
going back to Heathrow.

46:52.559 --> 46:53.936
This one tried to quit.

46:54.436 --> 46:55.896
Tell her to sack up.

46:59.733 --> 47:00.943
Hey.

47:05.614 --> 47:08.825
Call me on Tuesday.
We'll talk about the other thing.

47:08.825 --> 47:11.411
Ma'am, I'm sorry, it's not gonna work out.

47:11.411 --> 47:12.329
What?

47:12.329 --> 47:14.456
I have to say no.

47:14.456 --> 47:15.374
Yeah. I know.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.293
You're doing great.

47:18.293 --> 47:22.256
Just knock off that "I resign" shit.
It really pisses me off.

47:23.257 --> 47:25.092
I don't have that kind of time.
