WEBVTT

00:09.438 --> 00:10.638
I'm not gay.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.459
I don't care what you are.

00:14.137 --> 00:15.739
What does it feel like, Vera,

00:15.745 --> 00:18.584
to finally have everything
you've ever wanted?

00:23.418 --> 00:25.055
You care about me?

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

00:35.036 --> 00:36.369
I'll do it.

00:45.210 --> 00:49.117
Your medical test returned
positive for Class A drugs.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.923
How much do you need?

00:50.992 --> 00:52.538
What do I have to do for it?

00:58.107 --> 01:01.108
Hey, did you know that
seahorses like to swim in pairs?

01:01.114 --> 01:03.190
They link tails so they
don't lose each other.

01:09.108 --> 01:12.100
I'm so sorry, Bea, the doctors
said there's nothing they can do.

01:12.396 --> 01:14.599
I love you beautiful girl.

01:18.995 --> 01:22.610
If you wanna trap Ferguson,
we've got one last chance.

01:22.722 --> 01:24.576
Allie's not gonna wake up.

01:25.315 --> 01:26.924
So, that makes it murder.

01:26.930 --> 01:28.205
Do you have any evidence?

01:28.984 --> 01:31.510
All I need from you is access to her...

01:31.516 --> 01:34.508
then I can provoke her, get
details, and record her with this.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.889
I'm gonna finish this.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.320
Argh!

01:50.777 --> 01:52.384
I win!

03:15.481 --> 03:16.707
Hey.

03:17.536 --> 03:19.619
I'm... Franky.

03:21.152 --> 03:22.352
Bea?

04:50.409 --> 04:52.585
You look after your mum for us, Deb.

04:54.122 --> 04:55.481
Love you.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.716
Thanks for organising the plaque, Will.

06:26.772 --> 06:28.502
The epitaph, it's beautiful.

06:29.662 --> 06:31.297
They were Bea's words...

06:32.821 --> 06:34.741
it's what she used to
tell Debbie as a kid.

06:38.422 --> 06:41.117
A sudden death like this
puts things in perspective,

06:41.123 --> 06:42.323
- doesn't it?
- Yeah.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.103
I'm lifting your suspension.

06:49.382 --> 06:50.582
Why?

06:51.258 --> 06:53.284
Now's a time for us to pull together.

06:55.377 --> 06:57.618
You can come back at the
start of next week's roster.

06:58.411 --> 07:00.400
That's if you want to come back.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.453
Yes, I do.

07:24.449 --> 07:25.649
You okay?

07:25.847 --> 07:27.294
- You?
- Yeah.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.430
How's Allie?

07:29.436 --> 07:31.369
Physically, she's okay, but...

07:32.178 --> 07:34.002
You know the system's fucked.

07:35.565 --> 07:37.032
Ah, not completely.

07:37.455 --> 07:40.057
- Look at you.
- I got out by the skin of my teeth.

07:40.063 --> 07:42.057
Franky, it let Bea down,

07:42.261 --> 07:44.331
okay? But it can be fixed.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.154
Do you really believe that?

07:46.155 --> 07:48.040
In justice? Yeah.

07:48.837 --> 07:50.415
Otherwise, what's the point?

07:53.915 --> 07:55.661
That fuckin' Freak!

08:14.466 --> 08:17.140
The Crown might be willing
to drop the murder charge...

08:17.146 --> 08:19.384
if you agree to plead
guilty to manslaughter.

08:19.390 --> 08:21.247
She came at me...

08:21.959 --> 08:24.146
with a fucking screwdriver.

08:24.373 --> 08:27.490
Joan, you stabbed her multiple times.

08:27.496 --> 08:29.408
Because she wanted me to!

08:35.833 --> 08:40.312
Smith was in a no-prisoner area, and
that means there was a conspiracy,

08:40.434 --> 08:42.607
involving a member of staff.

08:42.613 --> 08:45.274
Basing your defence on a
conspiracy is dangerous.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.665
Only if I am wrong,

08:46.671 --> 08:47.964
which I am not.

08:47.970 --> 08:49.170
Who was it?

08:49.392 --> 08:51.786
Which member of staff aided Smith?

08:53.649 --> 08:55.472
Yeah, I understand that, but...

08:56.953 --> 08:58.429
Have you spoken to the Ombudsman?

08:58.435 --> 08:59.830
Obviously I've explained the situation.

08:59.836 --> 09:01.996
Does... does he have a full
appreciation of the situation?

09:02.002 --> 09:03.202
Believe it or not, we're on your side...

09:03.208 --> 09:04.817
- with these demands.
- Yeah, yes, yes...

09:04.823 --> 09:06.799
- What action have the police taken?
- Yes... the police...

09:06.805 --> 09:09.648
questioned my entire
staff, sir, as did I.

09:09.654 --> 09:11.174
Well, we're all under pressure.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.061
- I want a solid report.
- I'll do my best.

09:14.366 --> 09:16.146
And that's why they
pay you the big bucks.

09:16.152 --> 09:17.450
Yeah, not for much longer.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.645
I have until the next
board meeting, on Friday,

09:19.651 --> 09:21.630
to find out who let
Smith into no man's land.

09:21.636 --> 09:23.316
- It's four days.
- Or what?

09:23.322 --> 09:24.791
You're Acting Governor.

09:25.700 --> 09:26.900
W...

09:28.305 --> 09:30.019
What you need is a scapegoat.

09:30.515 --> 09:31.716
Someone to pin it on.

09:31.722 --> 09:34.171
- Yeah, I know what it is.
- People at the top do it all the time.

09:34.177 --> 09:35.571
- It's smart management.
- Really?

09:35.577 --> 09:37.017
Sounds a bit unethical.

09:40.370 --> 09:42.101
Sooner she's transferred the better.

09:42.107 --> 09:43.441
She's not being transferred.

09:43.447 --> 09:47.327
With new charges pending, she has
to be accessible to the courts.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.096
Uh, w... w... w-well what
about the deal Smith made

09:50.102 --> 09:51.997
- with the prosecution?
- Yeah, any deal Bea made

09:52.003 --> 09:53.904
died with her. On top of that...

09:53.910 --> 09:56.846
Ferguson's lawyer has petitioned to
have her released back into General.

09:56.852 --> 09:59.221
- Bullshit?!
- Citing human rights abuses, again!

09:59.227 --> 10:00.995
- Get the board to fight it.
- I did!

10:01.001 --> 10:03.018
The Ombudsman overruled it.

10:03.024 --> 10:06.432
Until the matter is tried, the
presumption of innocence applies.

10:06.438 --> 10:09.131
She's not dangerous until
the court says she is.

10:13.287 --> 10:15.311
How do you think Smith got out there?

10:18.997 --> 10:20.258
No idea.

10:21.591 --> 10:22.960
The only thing I am sure of

10:22.966 --> 10:25.876
is that Ferguson pulled a
screwdriver and stabbed her to death.

10:25.882 --> 10:28.459
- But that doesn't make any sense.
- Well, I don't pretend to understand

10:28.465 --> 10:30.109
the workings of that monster's mind.

10:31.321 --> 10:33.031
Sierra 6 to Sierra 5.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.477
Sierra 5, go ahead.

10:34.563 --> 10:36.860
Officer needs assistance in H1.

10:37.352 --> 10:38.785
Righto, on my way.

10:41.672 --> 10:42.988
Hang in there, Vera.

10:43.492 --> 10:45.206
Remember, none of this is your fault.

10:52.453 --> 10:53.653
Governor...

10:54.165 --> 10:57.279
police are questioning Ferguson.
Now she's claiming self-defence.

10:57.292 --> 10:59.561
- Governor, you've got...
- It's, um, Smith's blood.

11:23.706 --> 11:25.817
Bea's barely in the ground!

11:25.935 --> 11:29.343
You can't just come in here
and tear down her drawings

11:29.349 --> 11:32.813
and erase the last trace of
her life like she was nothing!

11:32.819 --> 11:36.436
We're just clearing her cell, Conway,
it's not the bloody Taj Mahal.

11:36.442 --> 11:38.139
- What's going on?
- Miss Miles...

11:38.145 --> 11:40.967
The prisoners aren't happy that
we have to clear out Smith's cell.

11:40.973 --> 11:42.633
It's just a sensitive topic,

11:42.639 --> 11:44.147
- Mr Stewart.
- The Governor's been very considerate

11:44.153 --> 11:45.467
in allowing your memorial wall.

11:45.473 --> 11:47.147
She won't be turning
Smith's cell into a shrine.

11:47.153 --> 11:48.577
- We don't... want a shrine!
- We don't want a shrine.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.332
- No!
- No, we just want a bit of time

11:50.338 --> 11:52.088
to be allowed to grieve and heal.

11:52.094 --> 11:53.533
This is prison, not a health spa!

11:53.539 --> 11:55.853
- Oh, mind your business.
- Please, how about some compassion?!

11:55.859 --> 11:57.564
You're fuckin' upsettin' Maxie!

11:57.570 --> 11:59.059
Watch your language, Jenkins.

11:59.065 --> 12:01.189
- You're too sick to be upset like this.
- Can we just wait

12:01.195 --> 12:04.502
till Allie get's back? You
know, delay it for a day or two?

12:04.508 --> 12:06.556
I think that's
an excellent compromise,

12:06.562 --> 12:08.185
- don't you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:08.299 --> 12:10.178
- Deputy Governor?
- All right.

12:10.307 --> 12:13.613
We wait until Novak's return
and then we clear it. Understood?

12:13.619 --> 12:14.819
- Yes.
- Yeah.

12:14.825 --> 12:16.189
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

12:20.346 --> 12:21.580
- Oh!
- Come on.

12:21.586 --> 12:23.384
- Just, come on.
- Come and sit down.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.238
Just can't stop thinkin' about Bea.

12:26.244 --> 12:27.501
Here you go, love.

12:30.252 --> 12:32.325
How desperate she must have been.

12:33.698 --> 12:35.423
I should have been here for her.

12:35.429 --> 12:37.310
If I was here, I could've stopped her.

12:37.316 --> 12:40.294
Oh, love, no, no, no.

12:40.522 --> 12:42.158
You know Bea.

12:42.364 --> 12:45.965
Once she had somethin' in her
mind there was no stopping her.

12:45.971 --> 12:48.070
- Yeah.
- Was there?

12:48.974 --> 12:50.356
You know that.

12:55.314 --> 12:56.584
Sorry about

12:56.590 --> 12:57.799
- your friend.
- Thanks for the flowers, Andy.

12:57.805 --> 12:59.965
- You're a sweetheart. Cheers, bud.
- Yeah, no worries.

13:01.102 --> 13:03.906
Hey, pre-sentencing report for Higgins.

13:04.798 --> 13:07.834
So, ah, when do I get to
go back to main office?

13:07.840 --> 13:09.540
Aren't I pretty enough for ya?

13:09.546 --> 13:11.514
Well, Fessler's got a nicer arse.

13:11.876 --> 13:15.075
Probationary period's over,
here's your performance review.

13:15.081 --> 13:17.988
Check it over. Happy, sign it.

13:17.994 --> 13:20.394
- It's glowin', right?
- The job's your permanently...

13:20.400 --> 13:21.600
if you want it.

13:23.284 --> 13:24.484
Oh, by the way...

13:24.653 --> 13:28.886
you did a decent job with
Higgins' Statement of Remorse.

13:29.655 --> 13:32.542
Yeah... and I reckon it
helped the victim too.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.450
You've gotta read this report,
Gidge. Old guy totally wants me.

13:36.989 --> 13:39.494
Hey, I gotta go, I'll
see ya tonight. Bye.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.292
Thank you, very much. I'll grab that.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.228
Oh, crap!

13:44.395 --> 13:45.595
Oh!

13:45.997 --> 13:47.607
Sorry, thank you.

13:48.216 --> 13:49.835
Hm... ah!

13:50.277 --> 13:52.097
Francesca Doyle?

13:52.801 --> 13:54.237
Hey, Mikey...?

14:01.953 --> 14:03.629
- Oh...
- Wait.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.395
Sorry, I have to... um...

14:05.401 --> 14:07.218
Can we um... Do you...

14:07.224 --> 14:09.046
do you wanna grab a coffee?

14:09.453 --> 14:10.851
- What?
- Can...

14:11.264 --> 14:13.313
- You know, just...
- No, I, t...

14:13.509 --> 14:16.049
I can't... I can't be near
you. It's a breach of my parole.

14:16.055 --> 14:19.128
- I understand that, but it's...
- I can't talk, I'm sorry.

14:29.992 --> 14:32.414
I was, ah, I was angry for a long time.

14:32.431 --> 14:34.338
I mean, it cost me my career.

14:34.718 --> 14:36.789
Who wants to look at this on their TV?

14:36.795 --> 14:39.133
It's a little too much reality.

14:39.831 --> 14:41.600
I'm so sorry, Mike.

14:42.196 --> 14:45.486
- I was so messed up back then.
- Yeah, no, I-I knew that...

14:45.888 --> 14:48.524
or why else would I,
like, push your buttons?

14:49.602 --> 14:52.633
It's fuckin' reality TV. You need drama.

14:53.662 --> 14:56.875
And it was great. Loved it, the ratings.

14:56.881 --> 14:58.636
Well, I think about what
I did to you, all the time,

14:58.642 --> 15:00.445
and how much I fucked up your life.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.617
I mean, I went to some dark places.

15:08.614 --> 15:09.840
But...

15:09.846 --> 15:13.145
it just made me think. Made me realise
what a monumental prick I'd been.

15:21.708 --> 15:23.848
Wha... what is that... that?

15:25.100 --> 15:26.843
Oh, it's a kite.

15:28.114 --> 15:29.521
Means freedom.

15:30.321 --> 15:31.633
Freedom.

15:36.410 --> 15:37.992
Governor wants a word.

15:39.703 --> 15:42.323
We need to prove that Bea
Smith was trying to kill me.

15:42.512 --> 15:45.196
And how are we going to
get that? Smith's dead.

15:45.202 --> 15:48.345
She would have told her plan
to one of her pathetic friends.

15:48.351 --> 15:49.638
I'll take care of them.

15:49.775 --> 15:51.691
- You concentrate on her.

15:52.587 --> 15:53.787
Vera?

15:54.392 --> 15:56.616
She's involved. I'm certain of it.

15:56.878 --> 15:58.994
She let Smith out to get to me.

15:59.197 --> 16:01.176
And trust me, Vera's the key.

16:01.182 --> 16:03.383
Vera's part of a plot
to ambush and kill you?

16:03.389 --> 16:06.798
You'd be amazed what a seemingly
respectable corrections officer will do,

16:06.804 --> 16:08.358
- given the right incentive.

16:10.253 --> 16:12.693
Just 'cause you fuck her
doesn't mean you know her.

16:18.552 --> 16:19.752
Governor.

16:29.805 --> 16:32.125
Thank you, Mr Stewart. You can leave.

16:40.237 --> 16:41.792
Jesper's murder,

16:43.601 --> 16:45.235
that was a lucky break.

16:45.820 --> 16:47.957
Not so, Bea Smith's.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.232
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, Joan?

16:51.238 --> 16:54.235
You and I both know that
I acted in self-defence.

16:54.241 --> 16:56.654
What makes you think the
women won't kill you for it?

16:56.660 --> 16:59.521
They've never been more afraid
of me than they are right now.

16:59.527 --> 17:03.209
I'd say they wouldn't dare touch me
for fear of suffering the same fate.

17:03.215 --> 17:04.959
I could find a reason to slot you.

17:05.028 --> 17:06.237
But you won't.

17:07.348 --> 17:09.170
Smith had help...

17:09.175 --> 17:12.846
from someone with a vested
interest in seeing me not walk free

17:12.852 --> 17:14.864
and I believe that someone was you,

17:15.036 --> 17:16.242
Governor.

17:29.226 --> 17:30.426
What's that?

17:30.432 --> 17:35.392
It's a statement recording my offer
of protection and your refusal.

17:35.664 --> 17:38.561
Absolving me and the prison of
any responsibility, should anything

17:38.574 --> 17:40.793
unfortunate befall you.

17:40.799 --> 17:42.195
And if I don't sign?

17:42.201 --> 17:44.473
I'll have you forcibly put
into isolated protection

17:44.479 --> 17:46.614
and I'll deal with your
fucking lawyers later.

17:57.272 --> 18:00.367
H5 has a spare cell. You can
be placed there in the morning.

18:00.373 --> 18:02.170
I also suggest you put on the teal.

18:02.176 --> 18:03.878
Don't think I'll be here that long...

18:04.485 --> 18:06.096
unfortunately.

18:07.952 --> 18:10.338
"Always demonstrates a winnin' attitude"

18:10.344 --> 18:12.637
and consistently exceeds expectation.

18:12.643 --> 18:14.463
Her proficiency in data analysis

18:14.469 --> 18:18.653
"is only surpassed by her
excellent communication skills."

18:18.659 --> 18:21.595
- Oh! Oh! Ha-ha.
- Oh, ha-ha.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.121
You're a cunning linguist.

18:24.484 --> 18:26.481
You're a dirty bird.

18:27.187 --> 18:30.209
- Red or white, darling?
- I'll stick with red, eh?

18:30.215 --> 18:33.435
Cab Sav? Pinot? Oh, hang on.

18:33.441 --> 18:35.308
Shiraz.

18:39.931 --> 18:41.942
I saw Mike Pennisi today,

18:42.841 --> 18:45.119
at a cafe where I get my lunch.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.636
Shit. Did he see you?

18:52.441 --> 18:54.081
We grabbed a coffee together.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.794
You what?

18:56.068 --> 18:58.185
It was... it was fine.

19:00.255 --> 19:02.641
Franky, that's a breach of your parole.

19:02.647 --> 19:04.549
What, and back staying with you, isn't?

19:04.555 --> 19:07.443
- Well, what if he reports you?
- He won't! He was...

19:08.533 --> 19:09.931
he was good.

19:10.033 --> 19:11.605
You know, it helped us, Gidge.

19:11.611 --> 19:13.480
I feel like a weight's been lifted.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.451
I feel free.

19:20.074 --> 19:21.274
Attention, all staff.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.822
Available officer to
Admissions for escort.

19:58.255 --> 20:00.374
- Are you happy about that?
- The thimble?

20:00.380 --> 20:01.758
- Thimble. What are you?
- Dog.

20:01.764 --> 20:05.088
- Right, Sonia's turn.
- Hey, look who's back!

20:05.094 --> 20:06.893
Oh, darlin'.

20:06.899 --> 20:09.916
Oh, lovey. It's good to
have you back with us.

20:11.803 --> 20:13.003
Hey.

20:13.705 --> 20:15.310
It's good to see you, Allie.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.130
- How're you feeling?
- Yeah.

20:18.136 --> 20:19.336
Yeah?

20:21.973 --> 20:23.293
Come here.

20:23.981 --> 20:26.072
We were so worried
about you, weren't we?

20:26.078 --> 20:27.278
Allie.

20:33.762 --> 20:35.397
Thank God you're back.

20:36.810 --> 20:39.120
I'm so sorry about Bea, kiddo.

20:49.133 --> 20:51.244
Ferguson's just been
put back into General.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.029
- What?
- Some bureaucratic bullshit.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.746
Bullshit's frickin' right!

20:56.041 --> 20:59.006
But she will never get close to you.

20:59.468 --> 21:01.579
You will always be
protected, isn't that right?

21:01.585 --> 21:02.785
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

21:03.772 --> 21:05.306
Thanks, guys.

21:06.772 --> 21:09.983
I just need some time
alone, if that's okay.

21:10.761 --> 21:12.816
You take all the time you need, love.

22:20.877 --> 22:23.387
- Hello?
- Francesca.

22:23.831 --> 22:27.128
It's... it-it's Mike, er, Pennisi.

22:29.713 --> 22:31.017
Are you there?

22:31.745 --> 22:33.253
How'd you get this number?

22:33.259 --> 22:35.511
It... it was so great
talking to you, ah yesterday.

22:35.517 --> 22:37.611
I was just... I was
hoping we could, um...

22:37.617 --> 22:39.112
meet for another coffee?

22:39.118 --> 22:41.523
Ah, Mike, it was terrific
seein' ya, but, um...

22:41.529 --> 22:43.853
unfortunately, we can't do that again.

22:44.235 --> 22:45.509
Why not?

22:46.618 --> 22:48.924
'Cause it's a parole violation.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.267
Well, that didn't seem
to bother you yesterday.

22:52.273 --> 22:55.379
Yeah, well, like I said,
it was great seein' ya...

22:56.548 --> 23:00.345
You know, seein' you was great,
but we can't. It was a one-off.

23:00.351 --> 23:04.684
Right. Well, may... maybe we can just
chat, er... er... er... over the phone?

23:04.690 --> 23:05.900
Nuh.

23:05.906 --> 23:09.537
No, I'm really sorry, but, um,
just please don't call me again.

23:16.612 --> 23:17.855
Hey, Mr Strathairn, can I

23:17.861 --> 23:19.941
- talk to you about some...
- Subpoena for the Begley file.

23:19.947 --> 23:22.026
You've got 20 minutes to
get that to the Registry.

23:22.346 --> 23:23.546
Yeah, I'm on it.

23:47.095 --> 23:48.331
And then that.

23:48.616 --> 23:50.225
One, two.

23:50.412 --> 23:53.051
- Keepin' you up, are we, darl?
- That's enough...

23:54.087 --> 23:55.933
Time for a smoko, Brenda.

24:00.158 --> 24:01.451
Bring her here.

24:16.717 --> 24:20.510
- What's happening?
- Same old shit, different day.

24:44.706 --> 24:46.097
Get it over with.

24:48.540 --> 24:50.369
You think it's that easy?

24:50.556 --> 24:52.877
I stick your hands in this thing

24:52.962 --> 24:54.865
and all is forgiven?

24:57.650 --> 24:59.585
Bea Smith attacked me,

24:59.591 --> 25:01.796
with a weapon. I had no
choice but to defend...
