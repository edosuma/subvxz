00:02.127 --> 00:04.338
Previously, on 90210...
I think you're
funny and smart.

00:04.379 --> 00:06.590
And I think
you're hot, too.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.051
We're gonna have to keep
this on the down low.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.094
It could really
hurt my reputation.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.096
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.264
Are you okay?
IVY:
I might have

00:14.306 --> 00:15.933
smoked some pot.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.185
You smoke? Since when?
Since...

00:18.226 --> 00:20.437
I realized that it
really helps me

00:20.479 --> 00:21.814
get back into the water,
you know,

00:21.856 --> 00:23.858
after my accident.
ADRIANNA: What kind of person

00:23.899 --> 00:25.442
goes behind their friend's back

00:25.484 --> 00:27.277
and starts sleeping
with their boyfriend?

00:27.319 --> 00:28.863
She didn't do it,
all right? It was me.

00:28.904 --> 00:29.947
I'm the one
who cheated with Navid.

00:29.989 --> 00:32.533
You bitch!
Guys! Hey, guys!

00:32.573 --> 00:33.868
Honestly, Ade,
I want our friendship back.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.953
Break up with him.
I can't.

00:35.995 --> 00:39.748
We've been friends for too long
to let a guy come in between us.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.583
I missed you.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.668
I missed you, too.

Hi.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.185
Hey. Wow.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.313
I think you dislocated
my scapula.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.273
(toilet flushing)
Oh.
(laughs)

02:28.315 --> 02:30.692
NAOMI:
Hey! You!

02:30.734 --> 02:33.112
Out! Now! Don't wash your hands.
You don't need to.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.279
Use hand sanitizer.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.405
Go!

02:39.493 --> 02:40.744
(exhales)

02:40.786 --> 02:42.287
Girls' bathroom.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.165
How taboo.
Well, I needed a kiss
before class.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.627
(knocking)

02:48.669 --> 02:50.129
It's occupied!

02:50.169 --> 02:51.964
(chuckles)

02:52.006 --> 02:54.466
Oh. I got you a present.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.551
Oh... come on.

02:58.095 --> 03:01.056
Oh. A shirt! Wow!

03:01.098 --> 03:02.641
That's nice.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.226
It's not nice; it's Gucci.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.771
It's amazing, but it's...
not exactly my style.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.564
No offense, but
your style sucks.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.483
"Geology rocks"?

03:11.525 --> 03:14.319
Honey, I don't think so.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.363
Look, Naomi...

03:16.404 --> 03:18.448
if I start swanning
around in Gucci,

03:18.490 --> 03:20.492
my friends are going to know
something's up.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.161
So we have to be careful

03:22.201 --> 03:24.621
if we want to keep
our relationship on the DL.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.165
Oh, fine, you're probably right.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.291
You can't be flaunting
it around school.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.169
But you could wear
it this weekend.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.004
Why don't I get a suite
at some fabulous hotel,

03:32.046 --> 03:33.463
we'll go swimming,
get massages,

03:33.505 --> 03:35.132
order whipped cream,
and you can eat it

03:35.174 --> 03:36.424
off of my...
I can't. I can't.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.635
What, are you
lactose-intolerant?

03:38.677 --> 03:42.097
No. But it's the Annual Academic
Invitational this weekend.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.516
I'm the captain
of the West Bev team.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.309
You're such a nerd!

03:46.351 --> 03:48.269
What can I say?
Well, what
about tonight?

03:48.311 --> 03:49.813
I have whipped cream at home.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.272
I'm just in
hard-core study mode

03:51.314 --> 03:52.482
for the Invitational right now.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.151
My teammate Alex and I
are cramming

03:54.193 --> 03:56.195
all night.
Okay, fine,

03:56.236 --> 03:58.530
have your little cramfest
with Alex.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.616
Next weekend,
you are mine.

04:03.202 --> 04:04.327
It's a deal.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.829
(knocking)

04:05.871 --> 04:08.373
BOTH:
It's occupied!

04:08.415 --> 04:09.666
(frustrated groans)

04:09.708 --> 04:10.751
Come on!

04:10.792 --> 04:12.086
SILVER:
Hey, baby!

04:12.127 --> 04:13.294
Whoa!

04:13.336 --> 04:15.005
What do you think?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.757
(chuckles) I think, uh...
I think...

04:17.798 --> 04:20.468
I think you have
bright orange hair.
It's so cool, right?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.221
I woke up this morning,
I looked in the mirror,

04:22.262 --> 04:23.722
and I was, like,
I need a change.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.891
Well, it's definitely
a change. It's...

04:25.933 --> 04:27.559
it's different.
Different, huh?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.894
Would that be...

04:28.936 --> 04:31.646
different amazing or...

04:31.688 --> 04:33.857
different fabulous?
Well, uh,
I'd have to go

04:33.899 --> 04:34.942
with different amazing.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.736
Oh, why, thank you.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.571
Oh, my God!

04:39.613 --> 04:41.240
Who did this to you?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.407
I did it myself.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.076
Okay, the most important thing
is do not panic.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.368
Do you still
have the package?

04:45.410 --> 04:46.828
Because you have
a major lawsuit

04:46.870 --> 04:48.247
on your hands.
No.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.249
Yes. We're going to sue the
jackasses who did this to you,

04:50.290 --> 04:51.750
and you're going to make
serious bank.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.543
But before that,
I'm going to go search

04:53.585 --> 04:55.087
the lost-and-found for a hat.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.546
Don't even
listen to her.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.590
Please. She's just jealous,
'cause she knows she can't

04:58.632 --> 04:59.591
pull it off like I can.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.176
(phone rings)
Hang on a sec.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.178
Hello?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.847
Yes, this is Erin Silver.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.766
(whispers):
It's the NYU rep.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.227
Absolutely.

05:10.269 --> 05:13.105
3:00? Yes, yes, I know
the Beach Club, sure.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.315
Absolutely.
Thank you. Bye.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.775
(screams)
Yeah!

05:16.817 --> 05:17.943
Oh, my God!

05:17.985 --> 05:20.070
I-I have my NYU alumni
interview tomorrow.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.655
Oh, my God!
You're gonna
be amazing.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.616
Oh, but-but what about
your hair?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.034
What about my hair?

05:26.076 --> 05:28.328
Uh, I just... it's a
serious interview, and...

05:29.997 --> 05:31.456
You know what?
You... you look great.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.626
It's totally fine.
Just... go for it.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.128
Thanks. (quiet yell)

05:36.170 --> 05:37.336
You're gonna be great.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.885
Whoa!

05:45.846 --> 05:47.222
What about this one?

05:47.264 --> 05:49.224
Oh, come on.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.893
"Dog walker" is just a fancy
way of saying pooper scooper.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.395
I wonder if anyone's hiring
one of those sign twirlers.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.439
You'd be cute twirling a sign.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.607
Ugh! This so hard.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.318
If I can't find a job soon,

05:59.358 --> 06:01.611
I'm never going to be able
to afford going to college.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.988
Well, hey, check
this one out.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.156
"Personal assistant.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.490
"Looking for bright,
self-motivated person

06:05.532 --> 06:07.492
"with great organizational
skills in Hollywood Hills.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.660
Discretion a must."

06:08.702 --> 06:09.995
Oh, my God.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.412
Hollywood Hills? Discretion?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.332
That is totally a famous person.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.499
Really? I don't know.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.293
No. I read about
it all the time

06:16.335 --> 06:17.544
in tabloids.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.129
Celebrities get you
to sign these agreements

06:19.171 --> 06:21.380
so you don't spill
their dirt to the press.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.424
Yet you're reading about it
in the tabloids.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.968
Whatever. You will be jealous

06:25.010 --> 06:26.803
when I'm hanging poolside
with George Clooney.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.097
(laughs)
(school bell ringing)

06:29.139 --> 06:30.515
Also in sports,

06:30.557 --> 06:32.726
girls' softball hurler
Karen Franklin pitched

06:32.767 --> 06:35.520
what would have been a no-hitter
were it not

06:35.562 --> 06:38.148
for the mighty bat
of Malibu's Lacy O'Connell.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.650
And still, the Lady Wildcats
were victorious

06:40.692 --> 06:43.402
and remain undefeated
as they enter postseason play.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.863
In other news,

06:44.905 --> 06:48.200
this weekend,
our Academic Invitational team

06:48.242 --> 06:50.160
competes in Oxnard,

06:50.202 --> 06:52.829
hoping to bring home the gold
once again.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.539
Now, an exclusive sneak peek

06:54.581 --> 06:57.709
at the brains behind the legend.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.878
BOY:
Those spots are not
chickenpox.
Hi. I'm Max.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.380
You get chickenpox
everywhere.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.007
My passions are biology and
astrophysics. I'm the captain

07:04.049 --> 07:06.051
of the West Beverly Academic
Invitational Team.
Shh!

07:06.093 --> 07:08.220
We've been state champs
for two years running,

07:08.262 --> 07:10.471
and this weekend,
we're going for our three-peat.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.808
So put your hands together,
give a loud West Bev cheer

07:13.850 --> 07:14.809
for your team.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.354
Oh, hi. Ooh.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.772
My name's Gilbert.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.566
Art history and archaeology
are my interests.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.068
Hi. I'm Allen.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.861
Chemistry is my bag.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.364
And I'm Alex.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.077
I love literature
and history.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.745
That's Alex?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.080
And together we're going

07:35.122 --> 07:37.082
to bring home the title.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.918
Go, Wildcats!

07:39.960 --> 07:42.629
(wildcat snarling)

08:02.107 --> 08:05.360
RAJ:
Now, you have a good day
at school, sweetie.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.946
Ugh. I don't want to go.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.198
Come on. I'll walk you in.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.455
Come on.
Is it that awful?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.538
Uh, yeah, Raj.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.958
It's high school, okay?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.336
It's totally
and utterly boring.

08:22.377 --> 08:25.005
It's way more boring now that
I'm not smoking pot anymore.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.340
Yeah, I hear you.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.300
Still, I'm proud of you.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.759
Whatever.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.094
Yo.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.886
Hey, hey. What's up, Raj?
What's up, Ivy?

08:32.929 --> 08:33.972
Hello.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.140
How you doing,
Dixon?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.683
Hey, man, I'm...
I'm living the dream.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.808
I'm living the dream, guys.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.144
Whatever.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.479
See, now, why
can't you have

08:40.520 --> 08:42.981
some of Dixon's positive
go-get-'em energy?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.649
Because I'm cool, Raj.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.984
Because I got
better things

08:46.026 --> 08:47.694
to do with my life
than just school.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.988
Oh, hey, speaking
of which--

08:50.030 --> 08:51.781
you know how, uh,
Hurley is coming

08:51.823 --> 08:53.658
to town this weekend
for the competition?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.243
They're scouting
women for the team.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.744
Yeah, yeah, I heard
something about that.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.330
I signed you up.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.123
I'm sorry. You what?

09:03.168 --> 09:05.045
Well, I... I know I should
have asked you first,

09:05.086 --> 09:06.587
but there were only
a few slots left,

09:06.629 --> 09:08.215
so I thought...
Well, dude, you thought wrong.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.342
I'm... Raj, I'm not into that.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.302
I'm not... I'm not interested.

09:12.344 --> 09:16.597
Ivy, you make the team,
and... and you're going to be

09:16.639 --> 09:18.641
traveling the world
in, like, two months.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.310
Surfing the best waves,
living your dream.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.602
Why wouldn't you want that?

09:21.644 --> 09:24.022
Because maybe I'm not
a sellout, you know.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.024
Maybe I don't need
to sell my soul

09:26.066 --> 09:27.942
just to get
a free trip to Bali.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.738
Okay.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.365
All right, my bad.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.824
Sorry.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.583
Hi, guys.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.001
Sorry I'm late.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.461
I had to tutor some freshmen.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.129
No worries.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.383
Hey, did anyone else
get the apple pie?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.968
It's pretty good.
It does look good.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.178
NAOMI:
Wait.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.846
Psst.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.519
What's up, Naomi?

10:02.561 --> 10:03.978
Hey.
Hey.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.564
What do you know
about that girl Alex?

10:05.646 --> 10:06.898
Alex Scarborough?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.400
She's brilliant.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.402
Like, a bona fide genius.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.154
Clearly not when
it comes to fashion.
Word is

10:13.196 --> 10:15.574
she's still deciding
between Oxford and Harvard.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.158
She fences, she plays chess.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.702
She's like Tom Brady of the
Academic Invitational team.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.789
What exactly is the Academic
Invitational thingie?

10:22.830 --> 10:25.041
It's pretty intense. It's,
like, all the smartest kids

10:25.083 --> 10:27.252
from the state compete
at Oxnard Pacific every year.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.254
Sounds lame.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.548
Yeah, well, you'd think so,
but, uh, it's notorious

10:31.590 --> 10:34.926
for actually having
the craziest after-parties.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.386
What?
I guess that's
what happens

10:36.428 --> 10:38.679
when you put all those repressed
over-achievers in one hotel.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.348
Oh, and I hear
everybody

10:40.390 --> 10:41.975
hooks up and gets wasted.
It's crazy.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.352
It's like one big nerd orgy.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.488
(sighs)

10:58.325 --> 11:00.619
Not interested.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.869
I'm sorry?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.122
What are you selling,
Girl Scout cookies?

11:04.164 --> 11:06.458
No. Uh, I'm Annie.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.127
I'm here for the job interview.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.129
We... we spoke on the phone.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.632
Of course we did.

11:13.672 --> 11:14.966
I'm Marla.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.717
Nice meeting you.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.474
♪ ♪

11:25.602 --> 11:27.228
Whoa.

11:28.938 --> 11:33.109
This place is very interesting.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.235
Interesting.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.070
Well, that's an interesting
choice of words.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.656
It's a mess.

11:37.696 --> 11:40.492
Well, you know, uh, it's...

11:40.534 --> 11:43.495
it's just certainly
well lived in.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.497
Please, sit.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.002
(sighs)

11:54.130 --> 11:55.298
(purring)

11:56.841 --> 12:00.011
So, uh, you're looking
for a personal assistant?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.471
Well, that's a little
euphemistic.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.307
Really, what I need is someone
to get my affairs in order.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.393
I have years' worth
of junk here.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.936
And some things,
believe it or not, are not junk.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.647
I need the whole place
organized,

12:10.689 --> 12:13.233
cataloged and cleaned.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.193
Oh. Uh, okay.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.444
Are you an honest person?

12:16.486 --> 12:17.571
Yes.

12:17.612 --> 12:18.863
Do you do drugs?

12:18.905 --> 12:21.824
No. I don't.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.201
You're hired.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.119
Oh.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.996
Well, there's something
about you, Annie, that I like.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.082
And quite frankly,
no one else applied,

12:29.123 --> 12:30.417
so the job is yours.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.212
I'll give you 1,000 a week.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.130
1,000 dollars?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.132
No, yen. Yes, dollars.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.218
You want the job or not?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.886
Yeah.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.638
Yeah, I want the job.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.021
Okay, what about this one?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.108
To a college interview?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.735
Okay.

12:56.775 --> 12:59.195
Then, how about just this one?
Yeah?

12:59.237 --> 13:00.988
Are you serious?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.323
Yes, I'm serious.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.742
I... I want to be an artist.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.702
It's okay for me
to look artistic.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.954
I'm applying to film school,

13:07.995 --> 13:09.330
not law school.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.040
Mmm, and certainly not
hairdressing school.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.791
You love it.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.965
You are wound up about
this interview, aren't you?

13:19.006 --> 13:20.717
Uh, yeah. But I'm all prepared.
Well, practically.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.636
What do I have to do?
Uh, I have to finish

13:22.677 --> 13:24.053
burning the DVDs of my reel,

13:24.095 --> 13:25.555
I have to print off
my portfolio

13:25.597 --> 13:27.014
and fill my scooter with gas.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.850
How about this one?
You love this one, right?

13:29.892 --> 13:32.520
You're going to wear leopard
print to a college interview?

13:32.562 --> 13:34.564
(snarls)
I just might.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.024
Hey, girls.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.443
Hey! I'm so glad you're here!

13:38.485 --> 13:40.903
I need help picking out my
outfit for the interview, okay?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.572
Oh, and... What do you think?

13:42.614 --> 13:44.031
NAOMI:
She did it to herself

13:44.073 --> 13:45.866
on purpose. (whispers):
So there's no one to sue.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.952
You like it?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.788
I love it.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.206
It is so you.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.832
Yeah?

13:53.874 --> 13:55.335
Thanks.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.877
Mm-hmm.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.764
Okay, West Beverly
with a lead of 84 to 80

14:07.806 --> 14:09.265
as we enter
the final speed round.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.684
You select the next topic.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.436
From which arena would you
prefer to answer questions--

14:13.478 --> 14:16.105
medieval poetry or biology?

14:16.147 --> 14:17.691
Biology, please.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.066
Excellent.
Here we go.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.069
"The duodenum, jejunum
and ileum are parts of what?"

14:22.111 --> 14:23.446
(buzzer)
Calabasas Canyon.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.989
The small intestine.
(bell dings)

14:25.031 --> 14:26.282
That is correct.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.993
"To which taxonomic class
do snails and slugs..."

14:29.035 --> 14:30.870
(buzzer)
West Beverly.
Gastropods?

14:30.911 --> 14:32.706
Or gastropoda, correct.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.290
"In the sexual reproduction

14:34.332 --> 14:36.292
"of bryophytes,
zygotes synthesized

14:36.334 --> 14:38.002
by the union of gametes
develop into..."

14:38.044 --> 14:39.546
(buzzer)
West Beverly.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.506
Sporangium.
That is correct.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.924
"In a eukaryotic cell,

14:43.966 --> 14:45.844
where does the Krebs cycle
occur?"
(buzzer)

14:45.885 --> 14:47.178
West Beverly.
In the mitochondrial matrix.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.596
That is correct.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.889
For the third
year in a row,

14:49.930 --> 14:52.183
West Beverly Hills High School
advances to the finals.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.853
Congratulations, Wildcats.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.479
(cheering and applause)

15:10.827 --> 15:13.371
(phone ringing)

15:16.374 --> 15:17.500
Hey.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.126
LIAM:
Hey. So how's George?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.920
Oh, fantastic.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.171
Yeah? You guys hanging poolside?

15:22.213 --> 15:23.631
Oh, yeah. You know,

15:23.673 --> 15:26.133
Matt and Brad just came by.
We've all been chillin'.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.261
I think we're gonna go
to Lake Como soon.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.346
Ooh, now I'm getting jealous.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.516
Please. I've been cleaning
all afternoon,

15:33.558 --> 15:35.518
and I still have not made a dent

15:35.560 --> 15:37.228
in all the junk
that this lady has.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.355
I swear to God, she makes
the Gray Gardens chicks

15:39.397 --> 15:40.481
look like Martha Stewart.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.442
Well, hang in there, okay?
Hmm, yeah.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.027
I mean, for a grand a week,
I'll do

15:45.069 --> 15:46.028
whatever the packrat wants.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.864
I'm just not sure

15:47.906 --> 15:49.073
how she can afford it.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.658
I mean, I guess it's from

15:50.700 --> 15:53.453
not having a cleaning lady
for 50 years.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.037
Aw!

15:55.079 --> 15:57.039
You okay?

15:57.081 --> 15:58.249
Ugh, I made a mess.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.042
Like that's even possible
in this place.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.294
I'll... I'll call you later,
okay?

16:01.335 --> 16:04.213
All right. Hey, enjoy Lake Como.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.632
All right. Ciao.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.402
Ah.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.329
No way.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.705
Oh.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.332
MARLA:
What are you doing?

16:39.373 --> 16:42.209
Oh, my God,
I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.253
I was looking
for a broom.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.588
And then I saw the box.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.256
And I was looking
at your things.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.591
Well, don't.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.927
I just... I mean,
I can't believe it.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.262
You were on the cover
of Life magazine.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.263
I mean, you're famous.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.516
I used to be.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.103
I used to be Marla Templeton.

17:06.901 --> 17:09.319
I can't believe that
you're an actress.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.488
I'm an actress, too.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.614
Well, aspiring anyway.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.701
Yes, I thought you might be.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.744
This town is lousy with
aspiring actors and actresses.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.707
Everyone who parks your car
or serves you a salad

17:20.748 --> 17:22.458
is wanting to be an actor.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.126
Yet very few people

17:24.167 --> 17:26.127
bother learning to act.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.422
Yeah, well, that's what
I'm hoping to do.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.299
It's why I need
this job, actually.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.718
I really want
to go to college

17:31.759 --> 17:32.927
and study acting.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.804
Well, good luck to you.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.806
It's not an easy career,

17:36.848 --> 17:40.226
but it can be
quite interesting.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.394
Interesting sounds
good to me.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.687
I just want to learn.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.148
Um, I saw that picture
with you and the guy

17:46.190 --> 17:47.942
from Easy Rider,
Peter Fonda.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.318
Are you guys friends?

17:49.360 --> 17:52.989
Friends-- uh...
uh, you could say that.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.490
Good old Peter.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.493
There was a time when Peter
and I had a standing date

17:57.535 --> 17:59.161
every Thursday night
at Musso and Frank.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.163
What's Musso and Frank?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.332
What's Musso and Frank?

18:03.374 --> 18:06.002
You really do have
a lot to learn.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.966
I bet you can't juggle
while reciting pi.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.634
What do you think
I am, a moron?

18:13.676 --> 18:18.598
3.14159265358979...

18:18.639 --> 18:19.849
Hey!

18:28.148 --> 18:29.859
Oh, hell no!

18:33.279 --> 18:35.698
(knocking)
NAOMI:
Housekeeping.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.158
Stay the hell away from him!

18:38.200 --> 18:39.452
Naomi Clark.
What are you doing here?

18:39.493 --> 18:41.621
Yeah, what are you
doing here?

18:41.662 --> 18:43.748
I'm here to stop you
from boinking this little whore.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.999
Memorize this,
you brainy slut--

18:45.041 --> 18:46.834
if you don't stay away
from my boyfriend,

18:46.876 --> 18:48.335
I will send your
head to Oxford

18:48.377 --> 18:49.921
and the rest
of your corpse

18:49.963 --> 18:51.089
to Cambridge.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.882
But-but...
But nothing.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.259
If you so much as look
at him again, you're dead.
Naomi...

18:55.301 --> 18:57.428
Oh, my God!

18:57.470 --> 18:58.763
Will you...
Alex.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.181
Alex, please...

19:01.223 --> 19:02.516
Alex.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.394
What is your problem?

19:05.436 --> 19:07.187
What's my problem?

19:07.229 --> 19:08.815
What is your problem, Max?

19:08.856 --> 19:10.900
What exactly
were the two of you planning

19:10.942 --> 19:12.944
to do in here, huh?
Study.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.362
Look around,
Naomi.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.952
You were going to study?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.453
Yeah.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.955
This is our team's room.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.372
We came in here to cram,

19:25.414 --> 19:27.291
because we made it
to the finals.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.252
Congratulations.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.797
Naomi, how could you think
that Alex and I...?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.423
Because I'm going crazy, okay?

19:34.465 --> 19:36.634
Because of the sneaking
around and the lying

19:36.676 --> 19:38.678
and not being able
to tell anybody

19:38.719 --> 19:39.679
that we're together.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.972
It's messing with my head.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.474
I can't take it.

19:45.559 --> 19:48.146
Maybe we should just break up.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.571
What the hell just happened?

19:57.613 --> 19:58.948
Uh...

19:58.990 --> 20:00.825
There was just a
misunderstanding.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.160
Did you talk to Alex?
Where is she?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.578
Getting in her mom's car,
driving back to L.A.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.788
What?
I tried to reason
with her,

20:05.830 --> 20:07.165
but for the first
time in her life,

20:07.206 --> 20:08.499
Alex was highly
irrational.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.835
Alex quit?
Yes, and the final round
starts imminently.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.962
If we don't have a fourth
teammate, we'll be disqualified.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.464
Okay, okay. Look,
don't... don't freak.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.717
Um, there's some guys
here from West Bev.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.302
One of them could fit in...
You know the rules.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.888
Each team needs a female.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.556
There are no females
here to watch us.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.682
We're totally screwed.

Welcome, everyone, to the 2011
Academic Invitational finals.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.991
Dominguez Hills High
versus West Beverly High.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.785
Captains, are your
teams ready?

20:44.827 --> 20:46.495
We are ready.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.539
Uh, we're ready, too.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.708

20:50.750 --> 20:52.168

20:52.210 --> 20:53.711
and I definitely don't know
the presidents.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.421
I mean, frankly, I don't really
understand gravity.

20:55.462 --> 20:57.715
I pretend to, but I don't.
I think it has

20:57.757 --> 20:58.883
something to do
with apples.

Cassavetes and I

29:18.131 --> 29:20.467
He started out
as an actor, you know.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.596
Not just any old type
of actor; a Method actor.

29:23.637 --> 29:24.888
Which would have been fine

29:24.930 --> 29:27.683
except for the type
of role he played.

final question worth ten points.

if you are correct,

29:36.775 --> 29:37.859

we will have

Saint Barthélemy,
otherwise known as "St. Barts,"

29:46.201 --> 29:48.621

by the French.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.539
In St. Barts'
coat of arms,

29:50.581 --> 29:53.833
what non-French language
appears in the bottom banner?

29:53.875 --> 29:55.043
You have 30 seconds.

29:55.085 --> 29:56.587
Oh, I know this one!

29:56.629 --> 29:59.214
Naomi, come on.
No, I used to vacation there
all the time, okay?

29:59.256 --> 30:00.674
This one time,
I was hanging out

30:00.716 --> 30:02.301
on the beach topless
waiting for my masseuse.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.761
No, hear me out, okay?

30:03.802 --> 30:06.054
Being topless is not a big deal
because my regular masseuse

30:06.096 --> 30:07.556
is Pierre, and he's totally gay.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.767
But this Olaf guy
shows up.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.143
Blonde, beefy, totally straight.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.103
So I threw a fit, right?

30:13.145 --> 30:14.854
But eventually we start talking.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.940
And I asked him how some guy
named Olaf ends up

30:16.982 --> 30:18.275
in the Caribbean,
and he tells me

30:18.317 --> 30:20.736
how his ancestors settled there
years ago.

30:20.778 --> 30:24.448
And he said-- I remember
clear as day-- that the island

30:24.490 --> 30:27.867
used to be a Swedish colony.
And so, the answer is Swedish.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.996
What about an era the
island was inhabited

30:31.037 --> 30:32.623
by indigenous peoples?
I say Amerindian.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.458
Agreed. There's historical
precedence for this.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.668
Amerindian.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.961
It doesn't make sense,
It's Swedish, Max.

30:39.463 --> 30:40.547
Five seconds.

30:40.589 --> 30:44.843
That would be, uh...

30:44.884 --> 30:47.220
That would be...

30:49.139 --> 30:52.267
that... that would...
be Swedish.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.935
That would be...

30:53.977 --> 30:55.020
incorrect!

30:55.061 --> 30:58.064
The correct answer
is Amerindian.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.359
Congratulations,
Dominguez Hills High,

31:00.400 --> 31:03.236
our new state
champion!

31:05.322 --> 31:07.115
Thanks for nothing.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.791
Ah! Ah-ha-ha!

31:15.833 --> 31:16.875
There you go.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.084
(phone rings)

31:18.126 --> 31:19.127
Hey.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.379
Hi!

31:20.420 --> 31:21.672
Hey. So how'd it go?

31:21.714 --> 31:23.465
Amazing!
I just had the best interview

31:23.507 --> 31:25.634
that you could possibly imagine.

31:25.676 --> 31:28.053
I mean, seriously,
imagine the best interview ever.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.137
Mine was better!

31:29.179 --> 31:31.973
(chuckles) That sounds great.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.266
It was beyond great!

31:33.308 --> 31:35.644
It was...
it was stupendous, Navid.

31:35.686 --> 31:37.312
Me and this...
this alumni guy, Christopher,

31:37.354 --> 31:40.524
we just... we sat down
and talked for hours!

31:40.566 --> 31:43.443
I'm going to NYU!
Seriously, I nailed it.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.320
I got to go.
I'm gonna call you back later.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.155
I have so much stuff to do.
Okay, bye.

Hi, Christopher.
Uh, this is Erin Silver.

32:03.547 --> 32:06.007
I just wanted to call
and say what a pleasure

32:06.049 --> 32:07.967
it was to meet you today.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.845
I mean, you really inspired me,

Hey. Um, got another question
for you.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.871
I was thinking about NYU,
and I need your opinion.

32:35.913 --> 32:37.790
Do I need to live in a dorm,

32:37.831 --> 32:39.999
or should I just live
somewhere off campus?

32:40.041 --> 32:42.502
Let me know. Thanks. Bye.

Hey, Christopher,
uh, it's Silver again.

32:52.262 --> 32:53.722
Hey, look,
I just had another thought.

32:53.764 --> 32:54.848
And it's about, uh, Black Swan,

32:54.890 --> 32:56.308
which is what we
were talking about today.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.518
And, by the way, that was just
the coolest thing to meet you.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.978
I know I already said that,
but anyway...

33:00.019 --> 33:01.563
Black Swan--
okay, you know how when Nina

33:01.605 --> 33:03.732
is looking at her doppelgaänger
in that one scene where she's,

33:03.774 --> 33:05.525
like, in the dance studio
looking in the mirror?

33:05.567 --> 33:06.902
I don't really understand
how they shot that.

33:06.944 --> 33:08.654
And, by the way,
the whole Black Swan thing...

33:28.674 --> 33:31.593
ANNOUNCER:
Ivy Sullivan does it again.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.219
Gnarly wave, Ms. Sullivan.

I'm with Hurley.

34:00.789 --> 34:01.957
Hey.

34:01.999 --> 34:03.291
Are you sponsored?

34:03.333 --> 34:05.418
No. No, I just, um...

34:05.460 --> 34:08.295
you know, like,
school tournaments and stuff.

34:08.338 --> 34:09.755
I have a feeling
that's going to change soon.

34:09.797 --> 34:10.966
You're good.
Like, real good.

34:12.257 --> 34:14.011
We'll be in contact.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.554
Okay, cool. Thanks, man.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.774
Hey. Raj, wait up.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.072
You're here.

34:34.112 --> 34:36.699
So are you.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.619
I watched you.

34:39.661 --> 34:40.786
You were awesome.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.789
Yeah... I was okay.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.666
And I was stupid,
and you were right.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.501
Yeah, well,
maybe it was

34:46.543 --> 34:48.127
a good stupid thing you did.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.005
Really?

34:50.047 --> 34:51.255
I guess.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.466
I mean, yeah, I was scared
this morning, but...

34:53.507 --> 34:55.844
I knew I could do it,
so I just said,

34:55.886 --> 34:58.179
"Screw you, fear," and I did it.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.182
Would it be
sappy of me

35:01.224 --> 35:03.602
to say that I am
proud of you?

35:03.643 --> 35:04.770
Yeah, maybe
a little bit.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.104
Well, I don't care.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.647
I'm proud of you.
Thanks.

35:07.689 --> 35:08.982
I'm sorry, Ivy.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.859
I'm really sorry.
Seriously, Raj,
next time you

35:10.901 --> 35:12.819
fake me out like that,
I'm going to let you drown.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.029
Oh, yeah?
No, no, no.

35:14.071 --> 35:16.031
Actually, I'm going
to make you drown.

35:16.073 --> 35:17.490
I'm going to drown you
like you're

35:17.532 --> 35:19.284
some little kitten or something.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.243
(laughing)

35:23.747 --> 35:26.041
(cell phone ringing)

35:26.083 --> 35:27.542
Hey.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.836
Hey. You want a ride to school?

35:29.878 --> 35:31.337
Oh, I'm actually

35:31.379 --> 35:32.422
already at Marla's.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.548
I have first period off,

35:33.590 --> 35:35.300
so I thought I'd get
a few hours in.

35:35.341 --> 35:36.969
Okay. How is she doing?

35:37.010 --> 35:38.386
Better. Better.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.138
I don't know what yesterday was,

35:40.179 --> 35:42.223
but she seems to be
herself again.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.892
She's pretty amazing, you know.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.226
I was watching one

35:45.268 --> 35:46.728
of her old movies

35:46.770 --> 35:48.897
online last night,
and she totally blew me away.

35:48.939 --> 35:50.649
Well, that's cool.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.191
She is pretty cool.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.568
Okay.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.736
Well, good.
I'm glad you guys are bonding.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.029
I'm a lot less jealous
than I would be

35:56.071 --> 35:57.155
if it was George Clooney.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.364
See you at school?

35:58.406 --> 36:00.075
All right. I'll see you later.
Bye.

Dr. Harris's office.

36:42.659 --> 36:46.454
Hi. Um, this is Raj Kher.

36:46.496 --> 36:49.499
And, um, I'm calling
because I wanted

36:49.541 --> 36:51.960
to schedule
my post-chemo checkup.

36:52.002 --> 36:55.421
Okay, it says here you were due
for a checkup two months ago.

36:55.463 --> 36:56.923
We've been calling you
every week.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.967
Yeah, I know. Um...

36:59.009 --> 37:02.929
and I've been avoiding
your calls every week.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.724
But, uh...

37:05.765 --> 37:08.476
I think I'm ready now.

37:25.202 --> 37:27.162
Hey.

37:27.204 --> 37:29.414
Hey.

37:38.715 --> 37:41.009
Look, I'm really sorry.

37:41.051 --> 37:44.179
I made a mess out of everything
this weekend.

37:44.221 --> 37:47.015
I'm an idiot, as if you didn't
already know that.

37:47.057 --> 37:49.684
You're not an idiot.

37:49.726 --> 37:53.646
Um, there's something
I have to tell you.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.523
Um, after the
Invitational,

37:55.565 --> 37:58.443
there's this famous party
that takes place at the hotel.

37:58.484 --> 37:59.945
I went to it,

37:59.986 --> 38:03.115
and... and it was pretty nuts.

38:03.156 --> 38:06.284
There were a lot of girls there,
you know.

38:06.325 --> 38:09.788
I mean, just acting wild
and blowing off steam.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.998
Yeah?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.667
And...

38:14.709 --> 38:19.714
well, I was surrounded
by all these girls...

38:19.756 --> 38:21.967
but all I could think about
was you.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.262
Really?

38:25.303 --> 38:27.097
Really.

38:27.139 --> 38:29.724
I want to be
with you, Naomi.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.604
And I'm sick of all this
sneaking around, too. It...

38:34.646 --> 38:37.941
You're my girl.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.986
And I want everyone
to know that.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.741
So...

38:46.783 --> 38:49.119
what do you say?

38:49.161 --> 38:51.871
You want to be my, like...

38:51.913 --> 38:53.498
official girlfriend?

38:54.958 --> 38:58.170
I know, with my track record,
you may not believe me,

38:58.211 --> 39:02.507
but I happen to know the answer
to this question.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.927
As long as you
don't say Swedish.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.138
The answer is, "Hell yes."
