WEBVTT

00:06.067 --> 00:08.400
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:08.433 --> 00:10.833
the future is uncertain
as winter sets in.

00:10.867 --> 00:14.300
SUE: You know, Alaska's
always gonna have
the upper paw. Nature wins.

00:14.333 --> 00:17.333
NARRATOR:
Sue tackles the threat of
an unwelcomed visitor head on.

00:17.367 --> 00:20.367
SUE:
Only a fool forces a situation
where we all have guns.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.767
NARRATOR: It's tough sledding
for Andy on the Yukon River.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.367
ANDY:
Something's not right here.
What the hell is going on?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.500
NARRATOR: Glenn chases
the hunters of the Arctic.

00:27.533 --> 00:29.267
Wolves went right
through here.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.400
NARRATOR:
And the Hailstones brave
the ice for native trade.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.967
AGNES: Dude, you can't
go too close to me,

00:34.000 --> 00:35.167
you're gonna freak me out.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.433
(SHOUTS) What the fuck?

00:53.700 --> 00:55.867
I'm gonna go get a load
of wood with the dogs.

00:55.900 --> 00:59.100
My woodpile over
by my workshop

00:59.133 --> 01:01.067
is getting kind of low.

01:01.067 --> 01:03.900
Now, I've probably
got enough for maybe two,
maybe three days.

01:03.933 --> 01:07.667
So you never have enough wood
when you're heating with wood.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.367
We'll take all of the older,
fat dogs out today.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.833
Give them some exercise, take
a relatively small team out

01:13.867 --> 01:15.067
and make them do some work.

01:15.067 --> 01:16.500
With these winds like this,

01:16.533 --> 01:18.867
it's probably gonna be
a lot of glare ice out
on the Ford Lake.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.600
It's a little bit dicey

01:20.633 --> 01:24.833
when you've got a sled
full of heavy wood like that
on that glare ice.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.067
NARRATOR: In winter,
the frozen lakes and rivers

01:27.100 --> 01:28.567
that surround Andy
and Kate's camp

01:28.600 --> 01:31.133
serve as highways
to various resources.

01:31.167 --> 01:34.300
But travelling on ice is not
without its dangers.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.067
ANDY: What kills you out on
that glare ice

01:36.100 --> 01:37.800
is you start sliding sideways.

01:37.833 --> 01:40.867
It instantly wants to flip
the whole sled over.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.567
You get thrown off the sled,
you smack your head.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.400
It's just all around
a bad day.

01:46.433 --> 01:49.067
Let's go harness some dogs up
and go get some wood.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.967
Yeah, you're like a big
old blimp, Alt.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.433
(BARKS)

01:52.467 --> 01:55.467
Let's go haul some wood
and work some of this fat off.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.200
Going and getting
loads of wood,

01:57.233 --> 01:59.400
the biggest challenge is
on the way back.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.067
This little sled is small,

02:01.100 --> 02:04.533
but it's gonna have
close to 500 pounds
of birch wood in it.

02:04.567 --> 02:07.133
And once it starts sliding
one way or another,

02:07.167 --> 02:08.567
that's a lot of force.

02:11.233 --> 02:12.933
During freeze up,

02:12.967 --> 02:16.167
exercising dogs
and getting firewood
is a big part of my life.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.800
All right, hup, hup!

02:27.567 --> 02:30.867
Weight and momentum
is a recipe for disaster.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.700
You have to go slow.

02:32.733 --> 02:35.667
If you can, you gotta,
kind of, take the momentum
out of turns.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.400
Be a little bit cautious but,

02:37.433 --> 02:41.667
you know, when the dogs
are ready to go and
they've got a lot of power,

02:41.700 --> 02:43.700
there's not much you can do,
except for just hold on.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.300
Go haw. That a girl.

02:52.233 --> 02:53.633
Atta girl. Let's go.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.267
Straight ahead.
Hup, hup, hup, hup.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.400
This is, kind of, the area
I like cutting wood.

02:57.433 --> 03:01.467
The flood in 2009 wiped out
this whole forest

03:01.500 --> 03:03.267
and just stacked it up
right here.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.633
So there's a lot of really
nice, good, dry birch,

03:05.667 --> 03:07.667
and cottonwood and spruce.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.333
Just a big mix of everything.

03:09.367 --> 03:12.233
It's only about
two miles from my house,

03:12.267 --> 03:14.833
so it's not terribly
far to go get it.

03:14.867 --> 03:17.633
I want to get the sled
a little bit closer
to where the wood is,

03:17.667 --> 03:20.600
'cause I don't wanna
have to carry it any farther
than I have to.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.900
So we'll get a little bit
of wood cut up here

03:22.933 --> 03:24.867
and start hauling it back.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.900
SUE: I educated myself that

03:26.933 --> 03:29.367
nobody else can
make you happy,

03:29.400 --> 03:31.200
that's something
you do yourself.

03:31.233 --> 03:32.700
They can add
to your happiness,

03:32.733 --> 03:34.433
they can take away
from your happiness,

03:34.467 --> 03:36.167
but never
without your permission.

03:45.967 --> 03:49.067
I did not know if I could
run Kavik on my own.

03:49.067 --> 03:53.100
So back-up plan, uh,
friends of mine had this cabin

03:53.133 --> 03:56.267
in Fairbanks
so I bought the property.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.500
But my pilot buddy
flew over and said,

03:58.533 --> 04:00.200
"Hey, you know
that cabin you got,

04:00.233 --> 04:01.767
"I thought I saw smoke
coming out the chimney.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.200
"You might have squatters."

04:03.233 --> 04:07.100
And if somebody is squatting
on my property, what you do,

04:07.133 --> 04:10.667
you get there, only a fool
forces a situation

04:10.700 --> 04:12.533
where we all have guns.

04:12.567 --> 04:15.600
Definitely for me, I'm packing
the 454 peashooter.

04:15.633 --> 04:17.267
The process is, I get there,

04:17.300 --> 04:20.067
go in and diffuse
the situation,

04:20.100 --> 04:23.233
see what the situation is,
handle it.

04:23.267 --> 04:25.767
NARRATOR: After leaving Kavik
for a foot procedure,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.733
Sue Aikens will travel
150 miles

04:27.767 --> 04:31.767
to investigate
possible squatters on her
property in Central Alaska.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.233
But freezing temperatures
have created
treacherous road conditions

04:35.267 --> 04:37.967
and driving is a risk.

04:38.067 --> 04:41.200
SUE:
I have a window of opportunity
to check on this place.

04:41.233 --> 04:43.500
I haven't driven this road
in three, four years

04:43.533 --> 04:46.633
and it was
really bad conditions.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.233
It's not a great road.

04:48.267 --> 04:50.967
For me, this is Fairbanks,
this is where we are now.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.333
But then we start going up

04:52.367 --> 04:54.833
and, you know, we're gonna go
higher up in elevation.

04:54.867 --> 04:56.100
We've got several summits.

04:56.133 --> 04:57.833
We're going over
the White Mountains.

04:57.867 --> 05:03.100
This right here, this is not
guaranteed to be open.

05:03.833 --> 05:05.267
That's what all that means.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.133
This is winter, and I've got
a big old pass to go over

05:08.167 --> 05:10.133
and 150 miles to get there.

05:10.167 --> 05:12.733
The world moves so fast here.

05:12.767 --> 05:16.067
In Kavik, I'm going,
"Putt, putt, putt"
five miles an hour

05:16.067 --> 05:17.633
thinking I'm all that,

05:17.667 --> 05:20.600
and here, people are going 50.

05:20.633 --> 05:23.667
And I don't have any control.
They're passing me.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.300
Nobody passes me in Kavik.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.267
I don't know.
Are they drunk?
Are they sober?

05:27.300 --> 05:29.667
Are they able to drive well?

05:29.700 --> 05:31.867
It's a whole field
of unknowns.

05:31.900 --> 05:37.700
So for me to be close
to the social world
everybody else lives in,

05:37.733 --> 05:41.333
you know, it's a lesson
in how does it feel
to have no control.

05:44.367 --> 05:46.733
CHIP: I look
at the subsistence way of life

05:46.767 --> 05:49.667
and I see a lot of good in it,
I see a lot of health in it,

05:49.700 --> 05:53.467
I see a lot of my family in it
and I see a lot of prestige.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.300
I mean, we don't have a lot of
money here in this house,

05:55.333 --> 05:57.333
but people give us respect.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.533
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,

06:10.567 --> 06:12.267
the freezing
of the Kobuk River

06:12.300 --> 06:15.533
is a brief window for
the family to catch whitefish
as they migrate,

06:15.567 --> 06:18.333
a key source of food
and trade for dark winter.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.400
Well, you know, it's the time
of year when whitefish run,

06:20.433 --> 06:22.567
and the whitefish run
when the ice is starting
to come along

06:22.600 --> 06:23.633
in the fall time.

06:23.667 --> 06:24.967
When they're here,
there's lots,

06:25.067 --> 06:27.133
and when they're gone,
there's nothing.

06:34.467 --> 06:37.067
NARRATOR: After setting
the nets before the freeze,

06:37.067 --> 06:39.333
Chip and Agnes
return to the river to test

06:39.367 --> 06:41.700
the newly formed ice
to make sure it's thick enough

06:41.733 --> 06:43.067
to support their weight.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.233
I'm just walking along here,
checking out the ice.

06:52.233 --> 06:55.367
I can see that it's frozen,
a lot of thickness to it.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.567
There's no bottom ice,
water, top ice.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.200
It's all just ice, ice, ice,
all the way to the river.

07:02.067 --> 07:03.433
So this is really good.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.933
Chainsaw is a new technology

07:07.967 --> 07:11.767
and my took
is my old technology.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.267
Either way
I get through the ice.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.767
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

07:31.767 --> 07:36.333
Yesterday we set this net and
today we're here to check it.

07:36.367 --> 07:39.233
This is a real good time
to set your net,

07:39.267 --> 07:42.300
when the ice is
about that thick.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.367
The ice is better
than last year.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.667
A lot thicker.

07:47.700 --> 07:51.433
Every day will be
a little safer
than the day before.

07:51.467 --> 07:54.133
As long as we do our part,
the fish will do theirs.

07:54.167 --> 07:56.100
Well, we'll see what
comes out of here.

08:00.733 --> 08:03.233
AGNES: Yee!
What a load coming up!
CHIP: Yep.

08:03.267 --> 08:06.767
AGNES: Fish been hitting
the net all the way from
the bottom to the top.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.100
We set our net just super.

08:08.133 --> 08:10.667
-Now we have
enough fish for dinner.
-Yep.

08:13.767 --> 08:17.433
My hands has gotten so cold
my polish is coming off.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.833
-Oh, thank you.
-Got your gloves. Here.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.433
We have dark winter coming on.

08:21.467 --> 08:24.267
Like any other fish,
when there's lots going by,
we get lots.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.067
And then when they're gone,
they're gone.

08:26.067 --> 08:28.633
And pretty soon there
won't be any whitefish
at all under here.

08:28.667 --> 08:29.900
They'll have all passed by.

08:29.933 --> 08:32.067
It's just the way that
everything is around here.

08:32.067 --> 08:35.567
The whitefish are passing by,
and the time to get them is
now, and we're on it.

08:39.133 --> 08:40.967
GLENN: I don't think life
has a meaning.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.567
It's not the kind of thing
that has to stand
for something else.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.567
A letter has a meaning,
a word has a meaning,

08:45.600 --> 08:47.667
it stands for something else,
it represents something else,

08:47.700 --> 08:50.167
but life just is,
it just exists.

09:00.267 --> 09:01.933
I'm gonna have a look
around for caribou.

09:01.967 --> 09:04.667
I walk out here on the lake
just a little ways
in front of camp,

09:04.700 --> 09:07.400
where I have a good view
of all the mountains
around the valley.

09:07.433 --> 09:09.267
I spend a lot of time out
here with binoculars

09:09.300 --> 09:10.967
just looking for caribou.

09:11.067 --> 09:14.467
Caribou are one of
the most important animals
to me out here.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.767
NARRATOR: Glenn Villeneuve
relies on the limited animals

09:16.800 --> 09:19.433
that surround him
in the Brooks Range
for survival.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.800
As the days grow colder,
it is crucial for Glenn

09:21.833 --> 09:26.067
not to let any opportunity
for meat pass him by.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.200
This time of year, they often
come down this way

09:29.233 --> 09:30.933
and they'll pass through
this valley some years.

09:30.967 --> 09:34.167
Other years, they stay up
high on the mountains.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.700
When I can intercept them,
I like to.

09:36.733 --> 09:40.400
I'm just looking around to see
if there are any in the area.

09:40.433 --> 09:42.067
Right now I'm living on moose.

09:42.067 --> 09:45.100
I've got a moose that I killed
about a month ago,

09:45.133 --> 09:47.067
but I don't
have any other meat here.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.233
I see caribou,
they're up on the ridge.

09:52.267 --> 09:54.300
They're a long way off,
they're out of my range,

09:54.333 --> 09:56.600
but there are
a few of them up there.

09:56.633 --> 09:58.533
I don't have a trail up there
right now,

09:58.567 --> 10:00.833
so it would be hard for me
to get up there right now.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.467
I probably wouldn't
be able to intercept them.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.400
By the time I got to the top
of that mountain,

10:04.433 --> 10:07.000
I think those caribou
are gonna be gone.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.367
They're travelling.

10:10.733 --> 10:13.267
If I had caribou here
on the lake that
would be really nice

10:13.300 --> 10:15.233
but they're not down here.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.667
So I'm gonna make do
with the moose meat I've got.

10:18.533 --> 10:20.067
(DISTANT HOWLING)

10:21.133 --> 10:22.500
Hear that?

10:23.233 --> 10:25.067
That's wolves howling.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.900
I'm going over there to see
what's going on.

10:29.933 --> 10:33.233
I'm headed over here because
there's some wolves howling,

10:33.267 --> 10:36.000
ravens flying up
out of this willow field

10:36.033 --> 10:37.833
about a half mile
from my camp.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.867
Something's going on.
I think the wolves killed
something over here.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.533
I'm gonna go over there
and see if I can find it.

10:42.567 --> 10:44.133
Sometimes if I get there
fast enough,

10:44.167 --> 10:46.700
I can get some meat off
of what they killed.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.400
And they may have killed
a caribou up there.

10:48.433 --> 10:50.300
It's possible. I'd love to
get some caribou meat.

10:56.333 --> 10:59.267
Getting across
the creek up here
is gonna be a little problem.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.133
It's pretty slippery,
all covered in snow.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.067
I don't wanna get my feet wet.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.467
Made it.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.100
The wolves are right up
this way.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.400
Right through the brush there,
the snow's all knocked off.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.867
Wolves went right
through here.

11:34.900 --> 11:38.833
Just a little while ago
they knocked all of the snow
off the brush right here.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.233
These are the tracks.

11:43.933 --> 11:45.400
See, here it is.

11:45.433 --> 11:47.333
Caribou,
they killed right here.

11:47.367 --> 11:49.167
The wolves killed
this caribou.

11:52.967 --> 11:55.767
Oh man, there's not much left.

11:56.733 --> 11:58.167
I got here too late.

11:59.533 --> 12:00.467
(SIGHS)

12:00.500 --> 12:02.633
They cleaned up most
of it already.

12:04.067 --> 12:05.433
They made a mess of it.

12:05.467 --> 12:07.367
As far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing on there
for me to eat.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.067
Still meat here
that the wolves will eat,

12:11.100 --> 12:12.467
but I wouldn't eat
any of this now

12:12.500 --> 12:14.067
'cause it's all been
chewed up by wolves.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.267
There are just scraps left.

12:18.767 --> 12:21.733
What I love about living out
here the way I live,

12:21.767 --> 12:23.133
is that most of the time
out here,

12:23.167 --> 12:24.433
it's just very calm
and meditative.

12:24.467 --> 12:27.667
It's a very silent,
quiet environment.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.433
It's very peaceful out here.

12:29.467 --> 12:32.433
But that calm and peace
is punctuated

12:32.467 --> 12:35.067
by excitement
like I had today.

12:35.067 --> 12:37.533
When something like
these wolves come along,

12:37.567 --> 12:41.233
kill a caribou,
it's the contrast.

12:41.267 --> 12:45.333
I like to live a really quiet,
calm life out in nature
most of the time,

12:45.367 --> 12:48.367
but I like the excitement that
happens every now and then.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.767
Something like happened today.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.333
A pack of wolves
in my backyard
killed a caribou.

12:53.167 --> 12:54.633
It keeps life interesting.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.167
There's nothing there
for me, though.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.700
I'm gonna head back,
go back to camp.

13:01.733 --> 13:04.400
Make myself some
moose hoof gelatine.

13:07.900 --> 13:10.667
SUE:
Remote people aren't ones that
really like to stand still

13:10.700 --> 13:12.967
and let the world
fall down around us.

13:13.067 --> 13:16.367
If it's falling, you know,
we're there to be like Atlas
and hold it back up.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.867
NARRATOR: After getting
a tip that squatters
are on her property

13:26.900 --> 13:32.500
in Central Alaska,
Sue is travelling 150 miles
in icy, perilous conditions.

13:32.533 --> 13:33.700
No matter where you are,

13:33.733 --> 13:37.300
whether you choose to live in
town or out of town,

13:37.333 --> 13:39.633
you know, Alaska's always
gonna have the upper paw.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.400
Nature's got the upper paw.
Nature wins.

13:42.433 --> 13:44.167
You can lay down
a piece of pavement,

13:44.200 --> 13:47.133
and nature's gonna say,
"Watch what I do to you now."

13:47.167 --> 13:48.767
You know,
"How'd you like that?"

14:04.900 --> 14:07.433
So yeah,
I'm just taking a minute

14:07.467 --> 14:09.167
and giving the paws
a little bit of a break.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.567
They're sore of doing
the manual transmission,

14:12.600 --> 14:15.167
but, you know, as you look out
across this vista here,

14:15.200 --> 14:17.133
this is the
Twelvemile Summit Wayside,

14:17.167 --> 14:20.333
but it's the Pinnell Mountain
Recreational Trail.

14:20.367 --> 14:24.600
I always kind of
stop here at this area.

14:24.633 --> 14:27.100
Almost 40-45 years ago,

14:27.133 --> 14:31.500
a state dump truck
lost control, swerved,

14:31.533 --> 14:35.067
killed a bunch of my friends,
and hurt some others
and family members.

14:35.067 --> 14:38.733
So for being somebody
who doesn't drive often,

14:38.767 --> 14:41.133
I'm kind of curious, you know,
40-45 years later,

14:41.167 --> 14:42.600
I'm on the same stretch
of road

14:42.633 --> 14:44.933
and it's a little icy
and I got little hurt paws.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.233
And, you know,

14:47.267 --> 14:51.167
take a minute to, uh,
my heart to theirs.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.167
You know, don't ever forget
your family, friends.

14:53.200 --> 14:58.433
And the decisions
you make today could
have deep ramifications.

14:58.467 --> 15:01.500
That sun's getting real low,
so I better start
making tracks.

15:19.133 --> 15:20.200
(TYRES SCREECHING)

15:20.233 --> 15:21.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:28.500 --> 15:32.533
I'm not even going
40 miles an hour.

15:32.567 --> 15:36.600
The road looks
in good condition,
but it's sheer ice.

15:36.633 --> 15:40.667
And these semi-bald tyres
couldn't get a grip

15:40.700 --> 15:42.867
and I lost control
of the vehicle.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.633
You know, I got it back.

15:44.667 --> 15:48.067
Yeah, the speed limit's 55,
fuck you.

15:53.067 --> 15:56.233
GLENN: People have a very
romantic view of nature,

15:56.267 --> 16:00.100
kind of,
peaceful and beautiful.

16:00.133 --> 16:03.467
It's actually,
there's a lot of suffering
that goes on in nature.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.567
This is the last piece of
butchered meat that I have.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.533
This isn't even
enough for a day.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.100
I have to go out and get
some more meat

16:25.133 --> 16:26.367
down off the meat pole now.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.233
Thaw it out in here and cut it
up into small pieces

16:28.267 --> 16:30.367
so I can
cook it and eat it.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.600
NARRATOR: With his stock
of meat wearing thin

16:32.633 --> 16:34.433
and unable to harvest caribou,

16:34.467 --> 16:36.567
Glenn must rely on
his stored meat cache

16:36.600 --> 16:39.400
to harvest a healthy
supply of protein.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.067
At this time of year
I've got my meat in
two places out here.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.533
Some of it's hanging off
this pole 20 feet high,

16:44.567 --> 16:47.500
and some of it's up on this
platform 15 feet high.

16:47.533 --> 16:50.467
The purpose
of these structures
is to keep the meat safe.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.933
If I didn't have
the meat up there,

16:51.967 --> 16:54.600
wolves would come along,
bears would come along,
eat the meat up.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.800
So I have to keep it up
high out of reach.

17:05.167 --> 17:07.100
Right here
I've got a moose head.

17:07.133 --> 17:08.467
I killed this moose
in the fall.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.767
I buried it in these antlers
in order to protect it,

17:10.800 --> 17:12.467
try to keep ravens off of it.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.533
And now the snow's
fallen on it
and protected it

17:14.567 --> 17:15.833
further from the birds.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.700
I just have to dig it out
and throw it down

17:18.733 --> 17:21.533
so that I can bring it inside,
thaw it out, and butcher it.

17:23.767 --> 17:26.400
Here's my moose head,
nothing got to it.
It's in good shape.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.733
Birds didn't chew it up.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.433
No animals got to it up here.

17:33.467 --> 17:37.067
This looks like a tasty hoof.
I'll take that one.

17:44.433 --> 17:46.067
Living out here
in the Brooks Range,

17:46.067 --> 17:48.200
I'm highly dependent on
moose and caribou.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.900
They make up the bulk
of my diet.

17:49.933 --> 17:52.100
And it's important to have
variety in your diet.

17:52.133 --> 17:55.867
You can have a lot of variety
even when you're only eating
one or two species of animal

17:55.900 --> 17:58.633
as long as you make use
of all the different parts.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.133
This is all thawed out.

18:02.167 --> 18:04.900
I'm gonna start
with this hoof this morning.

18:04.933 --> 18:07.767
All the ligaments and tendons
in that hoof will boil up

18:07.800 --> 18:11.833
and they'll turn the liquid
that I boil them
into gelatine.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.333
I'm gonna skin it.

18:14.633 --> 18:16.567
And skinning a hoof is tricky.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.167
I enjoy skinning.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.667
It's an interesting process,

18:24.700 --> 18:26.467
especially when you
get into the details.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.433
Just to understand how things
are put together,

18:28.467 --> 18:31.267
how animals are adapted
to the function.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.667
It's interesting.

18:32.700 --> 18:35.600
A hoof is a part
of a moose that's often
not utilised today,

18:35.633 --> 18:37.067
but I like to use the hooves.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.067
The gelatine that's used
in processed food today

18:40.100 --> 18:43.067
is made from hooves
of cattle mostly.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.933
And I make mine
from the hooves of moose.

18:44.967 --> 18:49.067
So a lot of people
are used to eating gelatine,
they just don't know it.

18:49.067 --> 18:53.300
Gelatine comes from boiling
up ligaments and tendons,

18:53.333 --> 18:55.833
a lot of which are found
right here in the hoof.

18:55.867 --> 18:58.267
When I started
living out here,

18:58.300 --> 19:00.500
I wanted to live as much
off the land as I could.

19:00.533 --> 19:03.733
And I started experimenting
and realised that

19:03.767 --> 19:07.867
just living on steaks,
and roasts, and muscle meat
every day is not good,

19:07.900 --> 19:10.467
but if you eat all of the
different parts of the animal,

19:10.967 --> 19:12.133
it feels good.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.233
Gelatine in the making.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.600
ANDY: One thing I'll say
about this country out here,

19:25.633 --> 19:27.533
there's no guarantees
to anything.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.733
The way it is,
is the way it is.

19:29.767 --> 19:33.067
And if you can't handle that,
you don't come out here
and do anything.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.433
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

19:48.667 --> 19:51.367
This is my favourite place
to come get wood.

19:51.400 --> 19:55.167
'Cause there's lots of it
from the 2009 flood.

19:55.200 --> 19:59.300
Lots of variety
in a small area.

19:59.333 --> 20:03.033
That makes hauling wood
become a much easier job.

20:03.067 --> 20:08.167
Well, this little sled,
when it's full of birch,
is probably about 400 pounds.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.833
And then another,
with me in all my winter gear,

20:10.867 --> 20:13.500
is about another 170, 180.

20:13.533 --> 20:17.400
So you're looking at
600 pounds in a sled.

20:17.433 --> 20:21.133
So that's about, a little over
100 pounds per dog to pull.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.300
Alaskans are very
unique people.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.633
We're all very independent,

20:29.667 --> 20:31.633
especially people living
out in the bush.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.400
We live out here to live
a certain lifestyle,

20:34.433 --> 20:36.133
to be connected to the land,

20:36.167 --> 20:38.367
to get the resources
from the land.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.633
And that's what's
important to me.

20:48.367 --> 20:51.000
The big thing is
when you got a heavy load,

20:51.033 --> 20:52.300
you've got more momentum.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.867
When you start sliding out,
you got more torque.

20:54.900 --> 20:58.000
When everything starts
twisting, it's hard on them.

20:58.033 --> 21:00.367
Anytime you put weight
on something,

21:00.400 --> 21:02.600
it totally changes
the whole formula.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.367
I'd say that's a load.

21:11.267 --> 21:15.267
NARRATOR: In winter,
Andy's dog sled is essential
to gathering resources.

21:15.300 --> 21:19.233
But adding weight to his sled
could make for a difficult
trek on the ice.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.933
The big thing
I have to worry about is
when I'm sliding sideways,

21:23.967 --> 21:26.233
hitting the snowdrifts,

21:26.267 --> 21:28.067
'cause that will
flip you in a heartbeat.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.267
Okay, let's go.

21:31.767 --> 21:34.667
We'll see what it's like
out on that glare ice
out on the lake.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.067
It's pretty, pretty windy out.

21:37.067 --> 21:39.567
It's gusting 25 to 30.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.067
And this is like a giant sail
out on that lake ice.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.333
Oh, shit!

21:52.467 --> 21:54.800
Oh, something's not
right here.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.433
What the hell? (GRUNTS)

21:58.900 --> 22:00.333
What the hell is
going on here?

22:01.933 --> 22:03.100
Oh, shit!

22:03.600 --> 22:04.933
Ho, ho, ho!

22:04.967 --> 22:06.400
Whoa! Whoa!

22:07.733 --> 22:09.100
God dang it!

22:10.433 --> 22:11.933
Looks like my ties broke.

22:11.967 --> 22:13.133
I kept pulling on... Whoa!

22:13.167 --> 22:14.233
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:14.267 --> 22:17.100
Ho! Everybody stay.

22:18.133 --> 22:20.500
Looks like both sides broke.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.867
I was having problems steering
coming over that trail

22:22.900 --> 22:25.967
and it looks like my plastic
even broke right here, too,

22:26.067 --> 22:27.367
and it's broken on both sides,

22:27.400 --> 22:29.467
so this stanchion's wanting
to come up.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.300
If this thing comes apart,
I could be left standing
with just a driving bough,

22:33.333 --> 22:35.200
a piece of wood in my hand,
and the dogs go home.

22:35.233 --> 22:36.867
And then I got a long
walk home.

22:36.900 --> 22:41.133
It could bust on me
and I could fall off
and smack my head on this ice.

22:41.167 --> 22:42.500
You just don't want
to take chances.

22:42.533 --> 22:44.433
And the worst thing
that can happen to dogs is

22:44.467 --> 22:46.367
running free with no driver
on the back.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.867
That's when dogs get
tangled up, legs get broken.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.067
These guys are my buddies
and they're dependent on me.

22:51.067 --> 22:52.700
I'm making the right decision
right now.

22:54.633 --> 22:56.467
I think if I take the weight
out of this sled,

22:56.500 --> 22:57.967
I'm gonna be okay.

22:58.067 --> 23:00.200
Everything's about efficiency.

23:01.067 --> 23:02.400
Bush economics.

23:03.933 --> 23:05.967
Sometimes shit happens.

23:06.067 --> 23:08.200
Oh, shit. Here's another
place that broke.

23:09.067 --> 23:11.067
That sucks.

23:11.067 --> 23:13.167
Here, this plastic's
cracking here.

23:14.367 --> 23:17.167
This broke under here, too.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.067
Basically I'm gonna have
to rebuild this whole sled.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.200
All right.
If that's the case then,

23:22.233 --> 23:24.133
better get it home
and get on it.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.133
Go.

23:30.067 --> 23:35.467
GLENN: There is no food
that evolved in order
to feed something else.

23:35.500 --> 23:39.333
They're trying to survive
and then something comes
along and eats them up.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.767
This gelatine's been boiling
for a long time

23:55.800 --> 23:59.133
and all the ligaments
and tendons off that hoof

23:59.167 --> 24:00.600
have boiled down now

24:00.633 --> 24:03.067
and that's gonna gelatinise
that liquid.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.700
But I have to separate
the bone

24:05.733 --> 24:07.133
and the tissues
from the liquid

24:07.167 --> 24:09.400
because I like my gelatine
nice and smooth.

24:14.367 --> 24:18.400
When this cools, I'll have
about a gallon of gelatine.

24:18.433 --> 24:21.467
That'll be really tasty
moose gelatine.
That's good stuff.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.400
I'll set this outside to cool.

24:30.133 --> 24:32.767
Right behind this eye,
there's a big chunk of fat.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.067
That's what I'm going for.

24:34.067 --> 24:36.267
Right here,
so I go right down in here.

24:43.067 --> 24:45.100
That's the eye fat.
That's really tasty.

24:45.933 --> 24:47.367
Fat is very important.

24:48.233 --> 24:50.067
In the cold weather

24:50.067 --> 24:52.167
and when I'm not eating
a lot of carbohydrate,

24:52.200 --> 24:54.800
most of my calories
come from fat.

24:54.833 --> 24:58.567
Look at that. All that fat
right from behind
the eyes of that moose.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.533
Here we got some gelatine.

25:05.067 --> 25:06.700
Ooh, that looks delicious.

25:08.100 --> 25:11.900
The idea that
it's a bad thing
to kill animals,

25:11.933 --> 25:15.700
to hunt, to eat animals
because it causes suffering,

25:15.733 --> 25:20.100
that's all tied
into a modern view of life

25:20.133 --> 25:23.533
as being something that is

25:23.567 --> 25:29.100
comfortable, and gentle,
and peaceful.

25:29.133 --> 25:30.533
That's one way
of looking at life,

25:30.567 --> 25:35.333
but I like the reality of life
under more natural conditions,

25:35.367 --> 25:38.133
which isn't always pretty,
but it's real.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.333
CHIP: We're not trying
to catch the tail end
of anything here.

25:42.367 --> 25:44.567
We always have fish,
we always have caribou,

25:44.600 --> 25:45.533
we always have heat.

25:45.567 --> 25:47.800
The kids are clean,
well-dressed.

25:47.833 --> 25:49.167
Pretty happy with ourselves.

25:56.933 --> 25:58.467
What we're gonna get is,
we're gonna get food

25:58.500 --> 25:59.867
for ourselves
and for our dogs,

25:59.900 --> 26:01.900
'cause a dog's got to eat
and we like to eat.

26:01.933 --> 26:04.067
And the way it looks,
over the next
couple three days,

26:04.067 --> 26:05.567
we should have a lot of trade.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.400
Whitefish is a good commodity
around here.

26:07.433 --> 26:09.367
You can get a buck or two
for each fish,

26:09.400 --> 26:11.733
in trade anyway,
worth-wise.

26:11.767 --> 26:13.267
It worked out really well.

26:14.900 --> 26:18.933
This one looks almost like it
was caught in the net before.

26:18.967 --> 26:21.933
CHIP: I would say that
if we get lots and lots
and lots and lots,

26:21.967 --> 26:24.067
we won't only have
for ourselves and trade,

26:24.100 --> 26:25.700
but we'll be able to give
plenty away, too.

26:25.733 --> 26:28.133
And my wife has sisters and,
that are elders,

26:28.167 --> 26:29.933
and we have
other people that are elders

26:29.967 --> 26:32.767
that rely on us for the fish.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.067
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
have a limited window
to harvest whitefish,

26:36.067 --> 26:38.867
an important commodity
for meat and trade.

26:38.900 --> 26:40.633
But working with heavy
nets on the ice

26:40.667 --> 26:42.133
cannot be taken for granted.

26:45.167 --> 26:47.300
The water's getting deep
on the river top here.

26:47.333 --> 26:50.067
AGNES:
Ice might not be strong enough
to hold our net, fish,

26:50.067 --> 26:52.400
and snow machine,
and people.

26:52.433 --> 26:55.067
I'm afraid of the ice
getting thin or rotten,

26:55.067 --> 26:57.933
there's a lot of times
when it just doesn't

26:57.967 --> 26:59.667
look safe enough.

27:02.867 --> 27:06.067
Dude, you can't
go too close to me,
you're gonna freak me out.

27:06.067 --> 27:07.467
(SHOUTS) What the fuck?

27:07.500 --> 27:09.633
CHIP: There's no need
for you to freak out.

27:11.867 --> 27:15.167
Don't be setting yourself up
for being like that.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.767
Get it out of your mind.
Sing a song.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.867
Whistle.

27:19.900 --> 27:23.833
We got water flowing
on top of the ice,
but under the snow.

27:23.867 --> 27:26.233
So this isn't exactly
the safest way to be out here

27:26.267 --> 27:29.067
doing this stuff,
but we're not doing too bad.

27:29.067 --> 27:30.267
We're doing pretty good.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.167
And we're not falling through,
we're pretty well,

27:33.200 --> 27:34.667
pretty well off here.

27:34.700 --> 27:37.067
If it gets any more dangerous,
we may skip a day or two.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.700
Hopefully it will get colder.

27:38.733 --> 27:41.600
Other than that,
just keeping up with the net
is the way to go.

27:41.633 --> 27:43.867
Look like we have enough.
I probably will just pick out

27:43.900 --> 27:47.433
-a few good ones and keep them
aside for trade, eh?
-Yep.

27:47.467 --> 27:49.233
CHIP: We basically do
call this shopping.

27:49.267 --> 27:50.567
We got almost 80 fish.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.567
I can't think of the last time
we've even bought fish.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.200
I mean, where would you even
buy fish in a store

27:54.233 --> 27:55.433
except maybe a can of tuna?

27:55.467 --> 27:57.533
AGNES: I don't think
I've ever bought a fish.

27:57.567 --> 28:00.433
I've sold fish,
I've traded fish.

28:00.467 --> 28:02.500
Ah, this one's full of eggs.

28:02.533 --> 28:04.833
-AGNES: The bottom of the...
-Sugliks.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.467
Oh, this one is a good one.

28:06.967 --> 28:08.067
(SLURPS)

28:08.067 --> 28:09.233
You want some?

28:10.667 --> 28:14.067
I have other methods
of getting them
to my mouth, but yeah.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.400
We got a bunch
more over here

28:15.433 --> 28:18.167
we could trade off,
if you don't eat them all.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.400
I'm not gonna eat them all.

28:19.433 --> 28:21.167
I'm gonna save this
one to cook.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.233
Whitefish with eggs
are the real prize.

28:23.267 --> 28:26.900
Real good trading material
if you come up with
a whole bunch of them.

28:26.933 --> 28:30.633
People will trade you
gas, or food,
or things from the store.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.067
How about when we get
these home, you'll...

28:33.067 --> 28:36.400
You can get on VHF and see if
anybody wanna trade.

28:36.433 --> 28:38.867
I can think of a lot of things
I'd like to have.

28:38.900 --> 28:41.467
-AGNES:
They're all in the can.
-Yep. Now grab that end.

28:48.667 --> 28:51.300
-It's been awesome fishing
with you, thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.600
ANDY: If you have a few
of these basic tools

28:56.633 --> 28:59.267
so that you can
turn natural resources

28:59.300 --> 29:02.133
into the things that
you need to build

29:02.167 --> 29:04.433
or create your life,
the way you envision it here,

29:04.467 --> 29:06.733
then those are tremendous
assets for me.

29:13.067 --> 29:15.633
Get this beast over in
the shop and

29:15.667 --> 29:18.667
try and rip her apart.

29:18.700 --> 29:22.200
I think I could have been
in big trouble if I would
have left that load in.

29:22.233 --> 29:23.867
It's barely held together.

29:23.900 --> 29:26.300
But it got me home,
that's all that mattered.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.267
This is a lot quicker
for me to rebuild this

29:28.300 --> 29:31.233
than to start from scratch
and build a whole sled.

29:31.267 --> 29:33.433
Put some new plastic on it,
she'll be like new,

29:33.467 --> 29:36.733
and hopefully
I can get another
five or six years out of her.

29:36.767 --> 29:38.267
All right.

29:38.300 --> 29:39.467
I like this sled.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.100
I've done a lot
of miles with it,

29:41.133 --> 29:42.600
and I've hauled
a lot of wood with it,

29:42.633 --> 29:45.167
and it's one of my favourite
little sleds to run around.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.267
It's, kind of,
my little Corvette,

29:47.300 --> 29:48.667
so I wanna keep using it.

29:51.067 --> 29:53.233
That was the guilty culprit.

29:53.267 --> 29:55.633
That's definitely
needed replacing.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.233
It's all messed up here.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.700
It's broken all back in here.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.733
That's all it would have taken
for me to lose that sled.

30:11.867 --> 30:14.667
This is probably the hardest
part of the whole process,

30:14.700 --> 30:18.233
is cutting a big piece
of this plastic by yourself.

30:18.267 --> 30:22.900
It's like trying to cut
a giant noodle.

30:22.933 --> 30:27.433
I didn't wanna screw that up,
'cause that's about
a $350 piece of plastic.

30:27.467 --> 30:29.133
(LAUGHS)

30:29.167 --> 30:31.733
I'm always nervous when
I'm making my cuts on that,

30:31.767 --> 30:36.633
'cause one mistake
and it's a lot of money
down the tube.

30:36.667 --> 30:40.433
It is the most important part,
it's the foundation.

30:40.467 --> 30:42.067
It's like the foundation
of a house.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.700
You know, if you have
a lousy foundation,

30:43.733 --> 30:45.167
you don't have
much of a house.

30:47.467 --> 30:50.033
There's nothing
like running a new sled,
psychologically.

30:50.067 --> 30:53.033
It's, you know, you're...
Just put a bunch of work,
and time,

30:53.067 --> 30:57.467
and effort into something,
that's always,
always a big deal.

30:57.500 --> 30:58.800
One more screw.

30:58.833 --> 31:01.633
I love making a mess, I always
hate cleaning them up.

31:03.233 --> 31:04.633
All right, I got her done.

31:04.667 --> 31:06.867
It's time to take her out,

31:06.900 --> 31:10.267
and see how she tracks,
and go get some wood,
and run some dogs.

31:11.267 --> 31:12.333
Bye!

31:16.767 --> 31:19.167
SUE: As remote people,
people in the bush, you know,

31:19.200 --> 31:21.767
we, kind of, have a saying
that, you know,

31:21.800 --> 31:24.300
we're all out here
'cause we ain't all there.

31:48.100 --> 31:51.067
You know, as I'm driving down
the road and it's dark,

31:51.067 --> 31:53.100
we got the northern lights,

31:53.133 --> 31:56.767
are just really bright,
really active.

31:57.533 --> 31:58.833
So that's pretty cool.

31:58.867 --> 32:01.267
The northern lights
are considered
a pretty lucky sign,

32:01.300 --> 32:06.833
so cross my fingers,
hopefully it's lucky for me.

32:06.867 --> 32:11.233
We're trying to find
the lead-in trail
to the cabin.

32:11.267 --> 32:16.500
But in the dark, when all's
you can see is a few feet,
they all look the same.

32:16.533 --> 32:20.067
But there's the hill
and I'm at the top
of the hill.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.200
It's gotta be around
here somewhere.

32:22.233 --> 32:25.600
NARRATOR: Sue is travelling
to her back-up cabin
in Central Alaska

32:25.633 --> 32:28.200
to investigate a tip that
there are squatters inside.

32:28.233 --> 32:32.167
But without any daylight,
she must approach with
extreme caution.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.233
Now my property starts here
on the right hand side.

32:36.433 --> 32:39.733
Okay. And there's a vehicle
in my driveway,

32:41.067 --> 32:44.133
but it doesn't look
like it's moved for a while.

32:44.167 --> 32:48.067
That's my driveway
right there.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.767
And there's a vehicle there.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.633
All right.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.100
Yeah, this has been
here a while, man.

33:11.500 --> 33:15.200
Somebody's using it
as like a trash dump.

33:15.233 --> 33:18.067
They just parked it here
to try and claim something.

33:27.433 --> 33:30.700
I mean, I've never
had a huge log across
my friggin' driveway.

33:50.333 --> 33:53.367
Like they say,
a lock only keeps out
an honest man.

34:00.167 --> 34:02.367
Somebody's been here,

34:02.400 --> 34:04.367
didn't respect that
it wasn't theirs.

34:05.433 --> 34:07.767
This has been junk
here for a bit.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.533
Looks like, maybe,
with the mattresses
on the floor and all that,

34:10.567 --> 34:12.067
it was a party house.

34:15.500 --> 34:19.567
From being a cute little
kitchen area to being this,

34:19.600 --> 34:22.067
the only thing that I can see
to fix that is a sledgehammer

34:22.067 --> 34:23.800
and some gasoline.

34:23.833 --> 34:27.533
So, I mean, all's I'm gonna do
is assess the damage,

34:28.300 --> 34:29.700
then make a decision.

34:29.733 --> 34:33.133
Do I wanna stay here
and start working on it now,

34:33.167 --> 34:35.133
or make a plan for the future?

34:39.300 --> 34:41.267
It's a little creepy
seeing the baby stuff.

34:41.300 --> 34:45.300
But to have little babies
out here and in this
kind of a mess?

34:45.333 --> 34:47.200
This did not come overnight.

34:47.233 --> 34:49.200
This is not somebody who went
hunting and thought,

34:49.233 --> 34:50.533
"Yeah, hey,
nice hunting cabin."

34:50.567 --> 34:53.067
You know, we'll use it
for a weekend with the boys.

34:53.100 --> 34:56.067
This was a family invasion,
man.

34:56.100 --> 34:59.233
Really the only thing,
after seeing that,

34:59.267 --> 35:01.367
the only thing I can do,

35:01.400 --> 35:03.300
I can't stay in the cabin.

35:03.333 --> 35:07.233
I've got a blanket,
I've got a car,
and I got time.

35:07.267 --> 35:10.067
You kip out for
a little while,
get up in the morning,

35:11.767 --> 35:13.333
and see where you're at.

35:13.367 --> 35:15.900
Right now, where I'm at is not
a healthy place mentally,

35:15.933 --> 35:18.567
but a lot healthier
than staying in there.

35:18.600 --> 35:22.067
I'll make a decision,
when I see it in the daylight,
how I'm gonna handle it.

35:47.267 --> 35:49.700
Not looking a whole lot
better in the day.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.267
I can smell it more
in the day.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.100
That ain't pleasant.

35:55.133 --> 35:57.567
I've just gotta assess,
make a plan,

35:58.567 --> 36:00.667
see what I wanna do.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.300
Who puts a frickin'
chicken coop in a house?

36:06.867 --> 36:08.633
Where do you pick and choose

36:09.633 --> 36:11.167
what you save,

36:12.500 --> 36:13.800
and what you fuckin'...

36:14.767 --> 36:15.767
There.

36:20.267 --> 36:22.500
You know, ta-da,
I've gotta flip that.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.767
It was a nice table,
now it's junk.

36:27.700 --> 36:28.933
Junk.

36:28.967 --> 36:31.533
There's not one piece
or stick of furniture here

36:31.567 --> 36:34.200
that I don't feel
creeped out about.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.333
I came to get intel
on squatters,

36:36.367 --> 36:39.067
I got more
than I bargained for.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.833
Life's like poker, you know,
you gotta play the hand
you get.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.867
You know,
make the best out of it.

36:43.900 --> 36:46.433
It was a lot of effort
to get out here.

36:46.467 --> 36:52.200
It was monetary and personal,
not a wasted trip at all.

36:52.233 --> 36:55.133
Emotional trip,
you know, head-trip.

36:55.167 --> 36:58.733
The structural integrity
is still here.

36:58.767 --> 37:01.633
You know,
cosmetic integrity? No.

37:01.667 --> 37:04.700
I gotta get back to town,
I gotta get my stuff together.

37:04.733 --> 37:07.267
I gotta get Ermie,
I gotta get back to Kavik,

37:07.300 --> 37:09.700
and I have to make a plan
to make this better.

37:14.233 --> 37:17.167
ANDY: In dealing
with multiple personalities,

37:17.200 --> 37:20.100
10 or 12 dogs,
or even five or six dogs,

37:20.133 --> 37:21.867
you're gonna deal with
issues at times.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.367
And it's how you work
through those

37:23.400 --> 37:25.700
and come home
at the end of the day
that makes it fun,

37:25.733 --> 37:27.233
and exciting, and challenging.

37:36.767 --> 37:39.733
(WHINING)

37:39.767 --> 37:41.467
Gambo's ready!
Alt's ready!

37:42.567 --> 37:44.367
Everybody's ready.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.267
Let's see if the sled's ready.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.233
All right.
I guess we're going.

37:52.767 --> 37:55.500
NARRATOR:
After repairing the foundation
of his dog sled,

37:55.533 --> 37:58.067
Andy must retrieve
the firewood he left behind

37:58.067 --> 37:59.700
and make sure his sled
is fully able

37:59.733 --> 38:02.467
to withstand the harsh
winter trail conditions.

38:04.267 --> 38:06.600
ANDY: Good. Whoa, whoa,
easy, easy, easy.

38:06.633 --> 38:10.567
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa! Good!

38:10.600 --> 38:12.233
All right, come haw.

38:14.633 --> 38:17.133
Sled's doing real good.

38:17.167 --> 38:19.767
The test is
when it has a load in it.

38:19.800 --> 38:23.567
It felt pretty tuned up and
it felt... Felt good.

38:23.600 --> 38:27.100
Put all this wood in here
and see what it does.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.633
This will be a test for it.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.367
A good load of wood like this,

38:34.067 --> 38:35.700
I'd say that's a load.

38:38.567 --> 38:40.067
You guys ready to go?

38:41.333 --> 38:43.167
Okay, let's go. Hup, hup.

38:44.967 --> 38:47.233
Yeah, let's rock and roll,
guys.

38:47.267 --> 38:49.767
A lot of labour and work
goes into having dogs

38:49.800 --> 38:51.200
and so you want a payback,

38:51.233 --> 38:53.433
and my payback
is hauling wood.

38:53.467 --> 38:55.767
There's a million
different things that
they can do for me,

38:55.800 --> 38:59.900
it's unlimited.
They're tougher than hell
and they just love to work.

39:00.067 --> 39:02.367
It's not punishment
to take 'em out.
You can see it.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.267
The second they see me
or hear me move

39:04.300 --> 39:07.833
one of these sleds around,
it's chaos in the yard,

39:07.867 --> 39:11.067
'cause they're happy
and they wanna be
the one chosen to go.

39:13.467 --> 39:15.533
We're gonna go gee
up here, Tope.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.200
Atta boys, all the way.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.667
Yeah. Whoa.

39:24.167 --> 39:28.600
Yay! That was perfect, Tope.
Good girl.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.367
Yeah, that felt really good.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.267
Drove perfect.
The bridle is adjusted
just perfect.

39:33.300 --> 39:36.700
I'll offload the wood
and split a little bit up
for tomorrow morning.

39:36.733 --> 39:40.100
See my woodpile's about gone,
so this is good timing.

39:40.133 --> 39:42.467
If it all goes good,
I won't have to do this repair

39:42.500 --> 39:44.100
for a long time again,

39:45.100 --> 39:46.600
but just another day

39:47.733 --> 39:49.300
in the life of a dog

39:50.367 --> 39:52.300
in my dog lot.

39:52.333 --> 39:54.433
Right, boys? They love it.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.267
Yeah, boys. Haw, haw.

40:03.033 --> 40:05.367
CHIP: You know, in the end,
it's self-perpetuating,

40:05.400 --> 40:07.033
that's the best part about it.

40:07.067 --> 40:09.200
So it's like basically
being self employed
in a bit of a business

40:09.233 --> 40:12.300
that can perpetuate itself
by skipping the money part,
mostly.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.133
Well, Agnes went inside
to get on a VHF,

40:38.167 --> 40:41.667
and I got a feeling
she's gonna probably get rid
of most of these here today.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.900
Not too many people
are running nets right now.

40:43.933 --> 40:48.633
I have some whitefish outside
if anybody's interested
in trading for gas

40:48.667 --> 40:50.433
or grub from the store.

40:50.467 --> 40:54.133
I'd be interested in some
fresh vegetables to trade for.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.400
Thank you.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.533
-Hello, neighbour.
-Hi!

41:01.567 --> 41:05.900
Just heard it over the VHF
that you were willing to
do a trade.

41:05.933 --> 41:08.200
-Sheefish, whitefish.
-Awesome.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.833
I have the ones with eggs over
there and one salmon.

41:10.867 --> 41:12.133
Oh, awesome.

41:12.167 --> 41:15.500
-Here's a bag of fruit.
-I'd love one.

41:15.533 --> 41:17.100
-There. There's three of them.
-All right.

41:17.133 --> 41:18.733
They're about the same.
Right on, thank you,
neighbour.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.267
Okay, neighbour.

41:20.300 --> 41:22.200
AGNES: Not bad, three fish.

41:27.633 --> 41:29.433
Five gallons of gas.

41:29.467 --> 41:30.567
Hey, awesome.

41:31.133 --> 41:33.200
I was asking for gas.

41:33.233 --> 41:36.767
You can take, I guess
whatever you want.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.067
-Mmm-hmm.
-These two in the oven,

41:39.067 --> 41:40.700
fry that one for
some other time,

41:40.733 --> 41:42.400
and give this to
your puppy dog.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.500
Yes, potatoes.

41:45.433 --> 41:46.667
Yee!

41:46.700 --> 41:49.733
A few people came over
and now I have some apples

41:49.767 --> 41:51.367
and oranges, some fresh fruit.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.500
I have five gallons of gas.

41:53.533 --> 41:56.433
And now I also have some
potatoes and onions

41:56.467 --> 41:58.800
to go with the fish dinner
I plan to have tonight.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.600
Awesome.

42:02.567 --> 42:03.633
Bye!

42:05.733 --> 42:09.833
Whitefish is a very
valuable commodity up here.

42:09.867 --> 42:12.733
It's almost like
a dollar bill to us.

42:12.767 --> 42:15.067
It's a delicacy people love

42:15.067 --> 42:17.300
and they'll trade
almost anything

42:17.333 --> 42:19.400
for some of the fish here.

42:19.433 --> 42:23.067
Yeah, for us, this is like,
you know, economic bonus.

42:23.067 --> 42:24.900
We get fish,
we can trade them around.

42:24.933 --> 42:28.067
We got gas
so we can go check our nets
with our machines some more.

42:28.100 --> 42:30.067
My wife got to trade for some
fruits and veggies

42:30.067 --> 42:32.100
and other stuff, some oil.

42:32.133 --> 42:33.600
It's, kind of, the way we have
to work with things.

42:33.633 --> 42:35.133
I get to hang out
with my kids.

42:35.167 --> 42:36.233
I get to work with my wife.

42:36.267 --> 42:38.500
This is for sandwiches
for tomorrow

42:39.633 --> 42:41.400
if you guys don't finish it.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.900
So we've got fish
for ourselves

42:42.933 --> 42:44.800
and fish for our family,
extended family.

42:44.833 --> 42:47.233
Fish to give away to friends
and for gifts and stuff.

42:47.267 --> 42:50.233
And fish for trade,
like Noorvik dollars.

42:50.267 --> 42:53.567
So they're whitefish.
Everyone likes them.

42:55.067 --> 42:56.600
-Not a bad day, yeah?
-Nope.

42:56.633 --> 42:57.900
-It was pretty good.
-Good teamwork.

42:57.933 --> 42:59.600
I've got five gallons
of gas outside

42:59.633 --> 43:02.267
and it didn't cost me nothing
but a couple fish.

43:02.300 --> 43:03.700
Gee whiz, that's great.
