12:00.220 --> 12:03.722
Were you trying to get
your Cutie Mark in spying?

12:03.724 --> 12:06.024
Is that on your little chart?

12:06.026 --> 12:09.160
No! We were just worried about
you when you lost the election

12:09.162 --> 12:11.896
and then you lost your friend
and then your mom yelled at you.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.065
We know you wanna change
and we think we can...

12:14.067 --> 12:16.267
HEEEEELP!

12:16.269 --> 12:18.036
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

12:18.038 --> 12:20.438
I was at the School Board
Meeting and they didn't approve

12:20.440 --> 12:23.141
my request for the new
playground equipment.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.409
Why not?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.377
There's no money in the budget!

12:26.379 --> 12:29.981
So I checked my Peggy Bank
to see if I had enough bits,

12:29.983 --> 12:33.118
but my little Peggy wasn't
nearly full enough.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.185
Don't worry, Pip!

12:34.187 --> 12:35.487
We'll meet you back at school!

12:35.489 --> 12:36.888
And help you find a solution!

12:36.890 --> 12:39.924
Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders!

12:39.926 --> 12:43.194
Oh, I already
have a solution.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.929
Our new Student
Pony President

12:44.931 --> 12:48.933
is going to be kicked out of
office and I'll be reinstated!

12:48.935 --> 12:51.002

15:02.435 --> 15:06.337

we adjourn? My daughter

acting like a high horse

15:23.189 --> 15:25.924

in your hoofprints.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.959
At first, I thought
this was fine,

15:27.961 --> 15:32.063

wanted something you don't have,

you, Crusaders.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.437
Obviously, I've known
since I got my Cutie Mark

16:12.439 --> 16:15.440
that my talent is getting other
ponies to do what I want.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.109
I just asked my father if
he could donate the money
