00:14.200 --> 00:18.876
We authenticated the data. Omicron made
the Sentox for the military. Who's Henderson?

00:18.960 --> 00:20.916
- Someone I worked for,
- Where?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.039
CTU. He was the man who recruited me.
Things ended badly between us.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.793
Are you accusing me
of being in bed with terrorists?

00:27.880 --> 00:30.599
I need access
to Omicron's Sentox programme.

00:30.680 --> 00:35.356
I gotta merge files, find out who was working
on this project. We need lT. They're next door.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.911
I listened to everything Bauer had to say. CTU
does not have enough information to hurt us.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.151
- What about Bauer?
- In about one minute, he'll be dead.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.880
Oh, my God!

00:47.440 --> 00:49.829
How could I be so stupid?

01:04.080 --> 01:07.038
There might be an attack
on Suvarov's motorcade.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.240
My people are not gonna chase that white
elephant. They're trying to locate Sentox gas.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.915
Let people focus on their work
or I will have you escorted out of here.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.560
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.790
- What?
- Section one-twelve.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.838
Take Mr Stiles and Miss O'Brian.
Put 'em in holding.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.309
And then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.915
I'm relieving you of your command
under section one-twelve.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.154
- Mrs Logan is with the Suvarovs.
- Get my wife on the phone.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.028
The terrorists were specific.
If I don't allow them to attack the motorcade,

01:38.120 --> 01:44.355
they're going to release canisters of gas
in multiple locations. You need to get out.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.715
We're under attack. We need backup now!

01:57.320 --> 01:58.833
We had an understanding.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.196
It happened outside of my authority.
I told no one.

02:02.280 --> 02:05.352
If Russia isn't going to pay
with the life of its president,

02:05.440 --> 02:09.558
then its new ally, the United States,
will pay with the lives of its citizens.

02:09.639 --> 02:12.552
Mr President, this is our final conversation.
Goodbye.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.039
No. Wait!

02:22.760 --> 02:25.399
- How long has he been conscious?
- Ten minutes.

02:25.480 --> 02:31.874
Before you go in, you should be aware of
something. Tony's been asking for his wife.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.191
- He doesn't remember.
- The explosion, but that's all.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.751
- We have to tell him Michelle's dead.
- No. He's undergone severe trauma.

02:39.840 --> 02:43.515
Stress will raise his blood pressure
and make vascular damage worse.

02:43.600 --> 02:49.596
Please, just hold off on telling him
till his condition is stabilised.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.439
Could you excuse us, please?

03:01.240 --> 03:04.562
Tony.
How are you feeling?

03:04.563 --> 03:07.234
They told me they took
Michelle to Cedars.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.675
Yes, they couldn't treat her here.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.399
Why? How badly was she hurt?

03:15.120 --> 03:17.759
Is she gonna be OK?

03:17.840 --> 03:20.070
As far as I know, yes.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.679
What's going on? They killed Palmer
and they tried to kill Michelle and me.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.311
David Palmer was the target. They killed him
because he was going to expose someone

03:30.400 --> 03:32.709
inside Logan's administration.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.268
They set Jack up to take the fall.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.432
- Did they get Jack?
- No. He's alive.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.875
He's working with us on a provisional basis.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.838
- Bill, I need to talk to Jack.
- You need to rest.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.799
No, I don't need to rest.
I need to talk to Jack. Now.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.679
- I'll tell him.
- Thanks.

03:53.080 --> 03:58.473
Could you do me a favour? Could you get
a message to Michelle? Tell her I'm OK.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.313
I will.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.152
Tony.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.034
We need you to get better.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.273
<i>This is Black Top One,
We 're one minute out.</i>

04:37.360 --> 04:40.272
Copy, Black Top One. We're standing by.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.555
Roger that,

04:44.320 --> 04:49.314
The navy helicopter is on its way, ma'am.
It'll take us back to the retreat.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.879
He...

04:50.960 --> 04:52.837
He...

04:52.920 --> 04:55.957
didn't warn the motorcade.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.837
Ma'am?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.911
Charles.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.231
He knew about the attack, and...

05:03.320 --> 05:05.754
he just let it happen, Aaron.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.191
That can't be true.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.238
He didn't just let it happen. He...

05:14.320 --> 05:18.598
He gave the terrorists
the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.590
Ma'am, why would he do that?

05:37.800 --> 05:40.758
- How soon before you're ready?
- A couple of minutes.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.831
I need to finish the arming mechanism.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.469
Make sure you place the canister
to maximise casualties.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.994
It must look as if this is a primary target.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.514
It'll be taken care of.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.351
- Yes,
- Do you have the key card?

05:55.440 --> 05:57.476
I'll have it within the hour.

05:57.560 --> 06:02.031
There can be no miscues. I'm using up
one of my canisters to create this diversion.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.795
Without the key card, it's all for nothing.
Call me when you have it.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.519
I will.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.509
- Hello?
- I'm going to be there soon.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.876
- Make sure you bring the money.
- You'll have it.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.269
And you'll have your precious card.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.314
Careful. It's all we've got left.

06:34.400 --> 06:40.236
Don't worry about it. In a little while,
we'll be able to buy all you want.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.240
Mrs Logan and the Suvarovs
have been treated.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.198
The chopper's picking them up now.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.916
- What do I say to my wife?
- She put you in an impossible situation.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.516
It's my job to handle impossible situations
and I failed, and not for the first time.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.309
I should never have given in.
I should have ordered back the motorcade.

07:04.400 --> 07:10.794
Sir, with all due respect, you don't have time
for self-recrimination. The attack failed.

07:10.880 --> 07:16.876
We have to assume they'll make good their
threat to use the Sentox on American soil.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.429
Has CTU made progress? Or are they waiting
for the other shoe to drop?

07:21.520 --> 07:27.516
They're looking for a lead, working the scene
where the motorcade was ambushed.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.910
Bill. They're airlifting the bodies
of the terrorists to CTU.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.230
- When will they be here?
- Any minute.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.629
- Let me know what you find.
- You got it.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.870
- Jack's calling in.
- Put him on speaker.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.396
We're in an emergency briefing.
Bill wants to put you on speaker.

07:43.480 --> 07:47.758
- I thought Lynn took Bill off the roster.
- Lynn's been relieved of duty.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.434
- OK, fine. Put me on.
- All right.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.592
- All right, you're on.
- Jack, what did you find at Omicron?

07:53.680 --> 07:58.231
Henderson set up the deal that allowed
the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.

07:58.320 --> 08:01.835
He tried to kill me by blowing up a bunker
Sentox was developed in.

08:01.920 --> 08:06.277
I managed to survive, but the servers were
destroyed. Henderson managed to escape.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.954
- Chloe, are you there?
- Go ahead, Jack.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.352
- Can you hack Henderson's computer?
- I did. Henderson's work station is clean.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.238
He wiped his hard drive,
but there's an active socket.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.392
- What does that mean?
- He's exchanging data with a link.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.072
Can you locate it?

08:21.160 --> 08:25.199
Yeah, the registry listing
is 5714 Tarrowood Drive, Toluca Lake.

08:26.040 --> 08:30.079
- Tarrowood Drive? That's his home address.
- I'll send a tac team.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.355
- No, Bill, I need to go in alone,
- Why?

08:32.440 --> 08:35.398
Henderson's good.
He'll detect a tac team moving in.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.950
- How do you wanna play this?
- I'm the last person he expects to see.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.712
I should be able to walk up to his front door.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.394
All right, but I want you in constant contact.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.798
Henderson is our primary link
to finding this nerve gas.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.678
I know. I'll get back to you.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.560
You've reached Banco Buenos Aires,

09:03.640 --> 09:09.033
Enter your party's extension, or press
the star button for immediate assistance,

09:09.120 --> 09:14.319
- Your identification code, please,
- 8477C, as in Charlie.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.231
Yes, how can I help you?

09:16.320 --> 09:19.869
I'd like after-hours access
to my personal safety deposit box.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.473
Yes, sir,

09:25.080 --> 09:26.718
- Buchanan,
- Bill.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.032
We found a schematic of some kind of
ventilation system on one of the terrorists.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.908
Since that's the way to deliver Sentox,
this could be their next target.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.833
- Do we know what building it's from?
- Not yet.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.276
Building and safety
are running it against their archive.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.794
Upload it to Chloe and Edgar,
I want them on this,

09:43.880 --> 09:48.635
Better make it fast. There's a number
handwritten in the margin. 1800 hours.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.712
- The attack could happen in the next hour.
- Yeah.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.875
That was Curtis. He's going to upload
schematics to our server.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.475
This is the likely target of their next attack.
There was a time on it.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.915
- It could occur in the next hour.
- Where is it?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.468
We don't know.
The only thing Curtis could tell

10:04.560 --> 10:07.233
is it's the ventilation
in an industrial building.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.835
- How big?
- Enough to hold several thousand. Find it.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.877
- How are you doing, Tony?
- Fine.

10:16.960 --> 10:20.555
Have you heard anything else
on my wife's condition?

10:20.640 --> 10:22.870
I haven't heard anything new.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.951
Sorry.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.189
- Tony.
- You have to get back to recovery.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.555
- Get away from me.
- Almeida, please.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.791
I said get away from me.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.872
Tony, come on.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.591
My God!

12:03.120 --> 12:05.156
Michelle.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.233
- Thank God that you're all right.
- Let go of me.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.357
Sorry. I made a mistake.
I didn't think I had any choice.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.874
Charles.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.474
It isn't just that you...

13:06.680 --> 13:09.319
You didn't stand up to them.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.277
You should've stood up to them.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.237
Martha.

13:19.440 --> 13:23.831
Yuri, Anya, I can't tell you how glad I am
that you're both all right.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.480
Thank you. It was awful.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.992
I'm deeply embarrassed
this could happen on US soil,

13:30.080 --> 13:34.278
but I promise you whoever did this
will be brought to justice.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.517
- Excuse me, Mr President.
- Of course.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.594
We both know who is responsible for this.

13:45.680 --> 13:51.038
We believe it was the group who attacked the
airport, but we thought they were all killed.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.998
Obviously you were wrong.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.914
The situation is more serious than you know.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.197
The terrorists have possession
of a military nerve agent.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.511
They've threatened to use it
against the population of LA.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.034
- How long have you known?
- We just found out.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.910
But given this change of circumstances, I'm
asking you to honour the terms of our treaty.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.833
Allow my law enforcement agencies access

14:16.920 --> 14:22.677
to whatever intelligence your security people
have on these separatists.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.557
- You will have our help.
- Thank you.

14:25.640 --> 14:30.760
I hope you won't find this offensive, but
there's something that's been troubling me.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.673
- What is it?
- Mrs Logan, her behaviour.

14:33.760 --> 14:37.150
She has not been herself.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.629
I'm sure she's very upset by what happened.

14:39.720 --> 14:43.349
Yes, I imagine she would be,
but I noticed this before the attack,

14:43.440 --> 14:47.149
from the time she entered the car
with Anya and me.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.191
The truth is my wife
has been under a doctor's care for a while.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.558
She suffers from depression and anxiety.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.359
It's been very difficult for both of us.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.637
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.509
- The guard said you wanted to see me.
- How long are you gonna keep me?

15:20.600 --> 15:26.755
You're not going out there any time today.
The district marshal's reviewing your case.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.043
I need to ask you a
favour, Bill. I know

15:29.124 --> 15:31.675
I don't deserve it. I
was unfair to you earlier.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.275
- What is it?
- I need to make a phone call.

15:35.360 --> 15:39.433
If you think you can get out of this
with a few phone calls, you're mistaken.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.479
It's not that, I swear. I'll give you
the number. You can clear it yourself.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.773
- What's this about?
- My sister.

15:46.774 --> 15:49.908
I need to talk to her
about a personal matter.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.639
- It can't wait a few hours?
- No, it can't.

15:52.720 --> 15:58.636
Bill, please. She's in a little bit of trouble
and I'm the only one who can help her.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.630
I don't need to clear it.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.712
Get Mr McGill a phone
and give him some privacy.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.669
Thank you.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.911
Thank you.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.870
- Hello?
- Jenny, it's me.

16:26.960 --> 16:31.670
Listen, I don't care that you took my wallet.
You can keep everything that's in it.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.911
- I just need to get my key card back.
- What key card?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.993
My CTU access card. It's of no value to you,
it just lets me in this building.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.230
Can't you get them to give you a new one?

16:41.320 --> 16:44.710
I mean, that's what I did
when I lost the key to my laundry room.

16:44.800 --> 16:49.237
Dammit, Jenny. This isn't a laundry room.
This is a secure government building.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.393
If you don't want me to call the police,
you'll get me back the key card today.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.789
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I do.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.030
Listen, I gotta go.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.874
- Where's that card from Lynn's wallet?
- Why?

17:05.960 --> 17:10.829
- I wanna give him his card. We don't need it.
- That's how I'm getting us all this money.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.992
You told me we were gonna take his cash
and a credit card.

17:14.079 --> 17:19.950
Yeah. I'm taking a credit card.
A $20,000 line of credit right here.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.434
$20,000?

17:23.520 --> 17:26.478
Who's gonna pay you that kind of money?

17:38.600 --> 17:41.273
- Yes, Mr President.
- I'd like to speak with my wife.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.793
- I'm sorry, sir. She asked to be left alone.
- I wanna see my wife now. Move away.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.348
Sir, she ordered me not to let anyone in.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.749
I'm not "anyone", Evelyn.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.913
I know, sir,
but she specifically mentioned you.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.639
I have to get to a meeting. Would you tell
my wife I would like to speak with her?

18:03.720 --> 18:06.393
Of course, Mr President.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.398
Thank you.

18:20.320 --> 18:25.314
I'd like you to find Aaron Pierce right now.
I want to know how he's doing.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.445
Is there a message
you want to get to him?

18:27.446 --> 18:29.871
If he's all right, tell
him I'd like to see him.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.989
Chloe, come here.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.834
- I think I got a match.
- There's a discrepancy.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.789
They're from different layers. Curtis's was
structural. This is an electrical blueprint.

18:41.880 --> 18:46.510
You're right. Mr Buchanan, Edgar matched
the schematics we got from Curtis.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.194
- Where is it?
- Tyler Memorial, Westwood.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.185
A hospital. Tell Curtis
to activate a tac team.

18:52.266 --> 18:55.150
I'll call Tyler Memorial,
tell them to evacuate.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.879
- Operations,
- Put me through to Tyler Memorial.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.636
This is Bauer. I'm on site
at the Henderson house. Do you copy?

19:48.720 --> 19:52.952
We found intel on the body of a dead terrorist.
There is going to be an attack.

19:53.040 --> 19:56.350
- Where?
- Tyler Memorial, we think within the hour,

19:56.440 --> 19:59.557
OK, I copy. I'm moving in now.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.276
- Miriam.
- Who?

20:32.360 --> 20:34.828
Christopher's wife. He's not here.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.879
- Tell Chloe I'm gonna get back to her.
- All right. We're on it.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.115
This is Manning with CTU.
I need to speak to the security officer.

20:45.200 --> 20:49.398
- You're talking to him. Tom Wegman.
- I'm heading to you now with a tactical team.

20:49.480 --> 20:53.758
The gas will most likely be released
into a ventilation unit. Seal the subbasement.

20:53.840 --> 20:58.595
- I've called in a second security shift.
- How long before the hospital's evacuated?

20:58.680 --> 21:02.275
- An hour, maybe two.
- This attack could occur within 30 minutes.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.828
This is a large facility, Agent Manning.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.718
We have 600 patients,
many of whom need assistance.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.634
Mr Wegman, if this nerve agent is released
into the ventilation system,

21:11.720 --> 21:14.075
everyone inside that building will die.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.550
Do what you have to do,
but get those people out of that building.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.755
Right.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.959
Hello, Miriam.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.758
My God!

21:35.840 --> 21:38.354
We thought you were dead.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.351
Where is he?

21:40.440 --> 21:42.635
What are you doing, Jack?

21:43.680 --> 21:45.716
Miriam, where's Christopher?

21:45.800 --> 21:47.916
He's still at work.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.878
- Did he call you?
- You're scaring me, Jack.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.952
- In the last hour, has he called you?
- No!

21:54.040 --> 21:56.998
Now tell me what the hell is going on.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.318
I need to see his computer.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.631
- What are you doing?
- Where is his computer?

22:05.640 --> 22:10.760
I'm not gonna tell you anything
until you tell me what is going on.

22:10.840 --> 22:15.391
Christopher developed a chemical weapon
system called Sentox nerve gas for Omicron.

22:15.480 --> 22:19.678
He enabled terrorists to gain control of it.
Now it's being used in Los Angeles.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.399
So where is his computer?

22:23.400 --> 22:26.517
Miriam, I am telling you the truth.

22:26.600 --> 22:30.593
- We have proof that he brokered the deal.
- That's impossible.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.797
Less than an hour ago, he tried to kill me.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.439
Move towards the living room.

22:47.480 --> 22:51.598
Keep walking towards the den.
I want you to take a seat on the couch.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.195
Look, why don't we just call him?
I'm sure there's an explanation.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.191
Miriam, take a seat.

23:02.080 --> 23:06.039
You don't need the gun, Jack.
You're not gonna shoot me.

23:22.480 --> 23:26.996
Chloe, I need access to Henderson's
hard drive. I need you to talk me through it.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.150
OK, Jack,

23:32.760 --> 23:34.637
Yes?

23:35.840 --> 23:39.799
- You wanted to see me, ma'am?
- Oh, yes, Aaron. Come in.

23:40.800 --> 23:45.191
I didn't really get a chance
to say thank you before.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.233
You saved my life. I know that
you'll say it was all just in the line of duty.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.675
Well, you're welcome.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.798
The country's lucky to have men like you.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.871
I'm lucky.

24:11.160 --> 24:14.709
I hope you'll allow me to say that.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.872
Mrs Logan.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.829
Would you excuse us, Aaron?

24:36.440 --> 24:38.431
What is it, Mike?

24:38.520 --> 24:42.911
- The president's been trying to reach you.
- I know.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.833
I don't want to see him.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.115
Would you like me to convey that to him?

24:48.200 --> 24:50.714
You can convey whatever you want, Mike.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.951
Mike.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.191
Mike, I want you to know
nothing happened in there.

25:07.280 --> 25:12.274
Whatever didn't happen,
make sure it doesn't happen again.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.272
- Clark, cover the north. Blake, you're with me.
- Manning?

25:30.360 --> 25:32.351
- Yeah.
- Wegman, hospital security.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.352
Thanks. Have you uplinked to CTU yet?

25:35.440 --> 25:39.513
We're doing it now. We've doubled security
at subbasement ingress points.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.512
- Nobody's getting down there.
- Good.

25:42.600 --> 25:46.036
The bad news is we have 26 patients in ICU
that can't be moved.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.270
Seven are high-dependency newborns.

25:48.360 --> 25:52.558
We can't relocate them without
specialised transport, which we don't have.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.633
- What about nearby hospitals?
- All neonatal units are in service.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.759
Thanks. I want a visual sweep
of high-probability targets in the hospital.

26:00.840 --> 26:05.118
Team A, start at the north end,
team B, take south. Move.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.669
It's Viktor. I'm at the hospital.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.797
- Then why are you calling me?
- They must have found out.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.793
The hospital's being evacuated.
The elevators and stairs are guarded.

26:42.880 --> 26:47.829
Calm down, Viktor.
Bring up the schematics of the hospital.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.510
There's an entrance to the subbasement -
an electrical conduit.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.797
- There's a good chance it isn't guarded.
- How do I find it?

26:59.880 --> 27:03.793
In the radiology wing. Call us
when you're there. We'll talk you through it.

27:03.880 --> 27:09.716
- I'll call you in a few minutes.
- And, Viktor, I need you to finish this task.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.075
Even if it means you don't get out.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.629
I won't fail you.

27:31.720 --> 27:35.633
DOD concluded a briefing with
Russian intelligence. We were given a name.

27:35.720 --> 27:41.352
Vladimir Bierko. He made billions in
the post-Soviet economy in weapons and oil.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.830
He bankrolled publications
promoting the separatist cause,

27:44.920 --> 27:49.835
- It's believed he was more than a sympathiser,
- They think he's financing these attacks?

27:49.920 --> 27:53.196
- They think he's directing the attacks.
- Based on what?

27:53.280 --> 27:56.397
Communiqués intercepted
by the Russian security force,

27:56.480 --> 27:59.950
supported by the fact
that Bierko vanished three months ago.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.873
We posted Bierko's profile
to interagency servers.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.873
Homeland Security has issued
an emergency brief to local law enforcement.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.633
Any hope of finding him before the attack?

28:10.080 --> 28:15.313
The most promising lead is a man named
Henderson. Unfortunately, he escaped.

28:15.400 --> 28:19.234
Jack believes that files on Henderson's
computer could lead to Bierko,

28:19.320 --> 28:21.834
He's trying to acquire those files now, sir.

28:21.920 --> 28:26.471
Let's hope he succeeds. The country's
suffered three devastating attacks today.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.950
- We need to stop this madman.
- Yes, Mr President.

28:32.520 --> 28:36.718
- Chloe, have you found anything yet?
- The only thing on it is domestic stuff.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.836
Bill-paying programs, music.

28:38.920 --> 28:42.629
He isn't trading music files with his office.
There's something else.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.871
- I'm doing the best I can,
- Why don't you face it?

28:45.960 --> 28:50.397
Christopher is innocent. He was when
you forced him out of CTU, and he is now.

28:50.480 --> 28:55.315
- Maybe you didn't hear. He tried to kill me.
- If he did, he was defending himself.

28:55.400 --> 28:59.154
No, he blew up the server room
while I was still inside.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.789
He was destroying evidence
that would've implicated him in this.

29:02.880 --> 29:08.876
This is familiar - you accusing him of being
a criminal. Why do you hate him so much?

29:08.960 --> 29:10.951
I want you to know something.

29:11.400 --> 29:15.313
Chris never hated you,
not even after what you did to him.

29:15.400 --> 29:19.154
When he thought you were dead,
he looked in on Kim. He cared about her,

29:19.240 --> 29:23.392
just like he cared about you.
We both did. You know that.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.914
- I found something,
- What is it?

29:26.000 --> 29:29.788
- It's a shadow drive. It was partitioned.
- What's on the shadow drive?

29:29.880 --> 29:34.237
A log. It contains data for every satellite call
Henderson has made in the last year.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.710
Can you cross-reference those
with numbers the terrorists used?

29:37.800 --> 29:40.917
I got into the log,
but the lists are password protected.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.673
Hold on. He had a secret file in his computer.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.593
- There's a list of numbers.
- And that implicates him?

29:46.680 --> 29:50.753
- We need access. You know the password?
- No, I don't.

29:50.840 --> 29:54.389
We believe there's gonna be another attack
within 30 minutes.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.756
Thousands of lives are at stake. Please.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.149
If you know that password, I need it now.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.594
I can't help you.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.080
- Chloe, try and hack in.
- I'll see what I can do,

30:12.160 --> 30:13.832
Hurry.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.193
Let me show this to Manning. Good work.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.838
Agent Manning?

30:20.920 --> 30:23.309
One of our guards caught this.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.359
This guy's dressed as an orderly,
but I've never seen him before.

30:27.440 --> 30:31.149
An orderly has no business being where he is.
That was five minutes ago.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.151
- Where is this?
- Subbasement.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.152
Team A, southeast stairwell.
Team B, form a perimeter.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.357
- We have a suspect. CTU, copy?
- We copy,

30:39.440 --> 30:42.955
Edgar, uplink the video surveillance
for facial recognition.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.508
- See if you can get a match.
- Got it,

30:55.240 --> 30:58.152
Curtis has a suspect.
We're running facial recognition.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.312
We're halfway through the database.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.992
- Got something.
- Print it.

31:03.080 --> 31:07.232
Curtis, we have a suspect. His name
is Viktor Grigorin, a Russian national.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.596
Served time for drug smuggling
and weapons trafficking.

31:10.680 --> 31:14.434
Copy that.
All teams, suspect is a confirmed hostile.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.795
Repeat, a confirmed hostile.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.394
Freeze!

32:14.360 --> 32:16.749
Don't move!

32:30.760 --> 32:33.274
Agent Manning,
you need to come look at this.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.555
Search him.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.833
Don't! It might be set to go off if it's moved.

33:08.360 --> 33:12.592
- Chemical response team, we need you here.
- Copy that, On the way,

33:12.680 --> 33:18.869
All teams, we've located the canister
and it is armed. Repeat, the canister is armed.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.158
CTU,
the chemical response team is on the way.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.710
Evacuation is in progress,
but there are a lot of people in here.

33:56.800 --> 34:01.396
Copy that, Curtis.
Edgar, notify LAPD and all relevant agencies.

34:01.480 --> 34:05.109
- I want a mandatory evacuation downtown.
- Yes, sir.

34:06.920 --> 34:10.469
- Henderson's using interlaced encryption.
- What does that mean?

34:10.560 --> 34:14.235
- It'll take me half a day to crack it,
- We don't have that kind of time.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.676
Sorry, It's tougher than it looked
at first glance, OK?

34:17.760 --> 34:18.829
All right.

34:18.920 --> 34:22.674
Jack, Curtis and his team
intercepted a terrorist at the hospital.

34:22.760 --> 34:27.038
- Did they take him into custody?
- No, he's dead. But they found a gas canister.

34:27.120 --> 34:31.716
They're trying to disarm it now, There
are patients there that can't be evacuated,

34:31.800 --> 34:34.757
Chloe, there's nothing you can do
about the hospital.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.672
There are still 18 canisters out there.
Stay focused.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.389
- I know.
- If I got more personnel, would that help?

34:41.480 --> 34:43.550
I've already got three analysts on it.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.033
Miriam.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.228
Miri...

34:48.320 --> 34:51.039
Honey, I want you to pack a bag. I want you...

34:52.800 --> 34:54.755
Don't you move.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.149
Miriam, sit back down.

34:57.240 --> 35:02.439
Put your hands behind your head,
get back up on you knees. Now!

35:04.200 --> 35:08.034
I want you to handcuff yourself
behind your back.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.993
Get up.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.435
Take a seat next to Miriam on the couch.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.548
- Are you OK, honey?
- I'm OK.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.152
- How do I find the nerve gas?
- I have no idea.

35:25.240 --> 35:28.277
- Where is it?
- Start with my knee, just like I taught you.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.396
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.392
- Where is it?
- He doesn't know, Jack. He doesn't know!

35:33.480 --> 35:35.596
For God's sake, leave him alone.

35:35.680 --> 35:39.753
Christopher, CTU found one of the canisters
at Tyler Memorial Hospital.

35:39.840 --> 35:43.753
It's armed. People are gonna start dying.
How do I find the nerve gas?

35:43.840 --> 35:47.913
Jack, leave him alone!
He doesn't know anything.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.714
Do you really trust him?

36:02.480 --> 36:05.392
Ask him what's in the briefcase.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.232
Unlock it!

36:22.520 --> 36:25.671
Ask him what he's doing with all the money.
Ask him!

36:25.760 --> 36:28.069
Christopher? Is this true?

36:28.160 --> 36:31.277
- Have you been lying to me?
- I've been protecting you.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.032
- By lying?
- It's not that simple.

36:33.120 --> 36:37.159
- I defended you.
- I defended you too, because I love you.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.754
There's not one thing I've done out of greed.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.991
Even when they fired me -
framed me - I served my country.

36:43.080 --> 36:46.277
I don't care how you justify it.
I am out of time.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.397
You are gonna tell me now
how to find the rest of the gas.

36:49.480 --> 36:52.278
Go ahead and do it, Jack.
Get it done. Shoot me.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.749
Kneecap me. Go ahead, do it. Do it!

36:58.400 --> 37:02.791
- Oh, you son of a bitch!
- I shot her above the knee. She can still walk.

37:02.880 --> 37:08.876
If you make me shoot her again, she'll be
in a wheelchair. How do I find the nerve gas?

37:08.960 --> 37:10.552
Dammit!

37:11.840 --> 37:14.593
- Where is it?
- Please. Please!

37:14.680 --> 37:17.990
- Don't you make me do this.
- Tell him what he wants to know.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.877
I can't.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.193
I can't.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.396
Forgive me, Miriam.

37:26.440 --> 37:29.398
You son of a bitch.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.593
You don't care about anybody.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.194
Not even her.

37:39.280 --> 37:44.593
Chloe, it's Jack. I need an ambulance on site.
I repeat, I need an ambulance on site.

37:44.680 --> 37:49.151
Miriam Henderson's been shot. I'm bringing
Christopher Henderson into CTU.

37:49.240 --> 37:53.313
I need an interrogation room prepped,
and a medic with hyoscine pentothal.

37:53.400 --> 37:57.473
- It'll be ready. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine, just get the ambulance here.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.711
- The team's on its way.
- Put Buchanan on.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.519
Mr Buchanan, Jack's on line one.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.194
- Jack.
- What's happening at the hospital?

38:06.280 --> 38:09.829
There's a CRT team on site. Stand by, Jack.

38:10.160 --> 38:14.119
- Curtis, what's your status?
- We're still trying to defuse the detonator.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.111
- Look what we found.
- Is the evacuation on track?

38:18.200 --> 38:22.034
- Hold on, Bill.
- It's a remote timing display.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.237
- Can you defuse the detonator?
- Not in 60 seconds.

38:25.320 --> 38:30.599
- Then we're gonna have to get it out of here.
- It could detonate if you move it.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.750
That's a chance we'll have to take.

38:32.840 --> 38:37.118
All teams, we're moving the canister
to the containment unit. All right, go, go!

38:37.200 --> 38:39.316
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, let's go!

38:39.400 --> 38:43.871
All teams, clear the halls. Clear the halls,
we're coming through. Go, go, go, go!

38:43.960 --> 38:47.191
Make sure the door's open.
Make sure the door's open.

38:47.640 --> 38:51.076
Go! Come on! We're coming upstairs.
We're coming upstairs.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.958
Go! Go! Move! Move! Move!

38:55.720 --> 39:00.874
Go, go, go! Clear the hall!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

39:00.960 --> 39:03.713
Keep the halls clear! Coming through!

39:05.800 --> 39:07.916
- Go!
- I need to clear this hall.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.436
Get them out of the way.
Go! Move! The hall's clear.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.353
Move! Move!

39:14.440 --> 39:17.352
- I need to clear this area.
- Move back!

39:17.440 --> 39:20.796
- Step aside, please.
- Get the door open!

39:20.880 --> 39:22.916
Come on!

39:23.000 --> 39:25.389
All right, get it in there.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.748
We have negative pressure.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.391
Clear!

39:47.960 --> 39:51.748
CTU, the canister detonated
inside a containment unit.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.831
- The hospital's safe.
- Good work.

40:22.960 --> 40:26.999
- I have the key card.
- How long will it take you to reprogram it?

40:27.080 --> 40:31.710
Five minutes.
Then we will be able to use it to access CTU.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.791
Good.
