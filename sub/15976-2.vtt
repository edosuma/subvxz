WEBVTT

00:05.036 --> 00:07.137
Okay, there you go.
That's it, now.

00:07.205 --> 00:09.305
Now, give me sultry.

00:10.573 --> 00:11.807
Not sulky, honey; sultry.

00:11.875 --> 00:13.142
Sultry...
Is it possible

00:13.210 --> 00:14.777
they don't know
what sultry means?

00:14.844 --> 00:16.678
- They're models. They don't know
what anything means. - Okay.

00:16.746 --> 00:18.580
Sell the coat.

00:18.648 --> 00:19.782
Now let the coat sell you.

00:19.849 --> 00:22.151
No, no, no.
Fabio, is it?

00:22.219 --> 00:23.286
- Todd.
- Todd?

00:23.353 --> 00:24.685
Could you step out
for a second?

00:24.753 --> 00:26.288
Get in there and show him
how it's done, chief.

00:26.355 --> 00:27.289
Okay, sure.
Thank you, thank you.

00:27.356 --> 00:28.290
Here we go.

00:28.357 --> 00:29.324
Yeah. I'm Zach.

00:29.392 --> 00:31.159
Uh, we went out a month ago.

00:31.227 --> 00:32.327
And it was so wonderful.

00:32.395 --> 00:33.461
Okay, you ready?

00:33.529 --> 00:35.330
You're out for a night
on the town.

00:35.398 --> 00:36.831
You're feeling
confident and sexy.

00:36.899 --> 00:38.633
Okay, remember, you're not

00:38.700 --> 00:39.767
just selling clothing;

00:39.835 --> 00:41.435
you're selling an attitude.
Now, go.

00:41.502 --> 00:43.870
That's it. You're feeling
good about yourselves.

00:43.939 --> 00:46.340
Oh, here comes a bus!
There it is! Good shock!

00:46.408 --> 00:47.474
Now give me tigers.

00:47.542 --> 00:49.576
Now baby tigers.

00:49.644 --> 00:51.925
- What's happening? - I just wanted
to see what they would do.

00:51.947 --> 00:52.879
Komiko, is it?

00:52.948 --> 00:54.648
- Carly.
- Carly, I want to see

00:54.715 --> 00:56.782
what happens if the dress is,
like, billowing in the wind.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.617
So Zach's gonna twirl you out,

00:58.685 --> 01:00.553
and then pull you back in
and dip you. Okay.

01:00.620 --> 01:01.854
Should I get back in there?

01:01.922 --> 01:03.589
Shh. No, no. Just wait.
Watch, learn.

01:03.657 --> 01:05.691
Okay, twirl her out.

01:05.759 --> 01:08.294
Pull her back in...
and dip.

01:08.362 --> 01:09.562
Sweetie, just step out
real quick.

01:09.629 --> 01:11.431
Let me show you, all right?

01:11.498 --> 01:12.597
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:12.665 --> 01:15.434
The trick is, look
him in the eyes,

01:15.501 --> 01:18.437
seducing, at the
same time, teasing.

01:18.504 --> 01:19.871
Remember, you're the prey,

01:19.939 --> 01:21.706
and you're inviting
the hunt, like...

01:21.774 --> 01:22.907
No, no, no.

01:22.976 --> 01:26.478
And now you twirl
me, you brute!

01:26.545 --> 01:27.879
Yes! And then
spin me around.

01:27.947 --> 01:30.348
And then we go out,
and then back again!

01:30.415 --> 01:32.749
And then over the
other side. Yes.

01:32.817 --> 01:36.753
I'm a feather... borne on the
wind, lost in the clouds!

01:36.821 --> 01:37.821
Komiko, eyes on me.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.390
One time, and now spin,

01:39.458 --> 01:41.425
spin, spin, spin!

01:41.493 --> 01:43.894
I want you to do it like that.

01:43.962 --> 01:46.762

02:02.812 --> 02:04.346
- What floor?
- 22.

02:04.414 --> 02:05.881
Hey, there he is.

02:05.948 --> 02:07.749
Great work on that
Neiman shoot yesterday.

02:07.817 --> 02:09.251
Ah, it was a team effort.

02:09.318 --> 02:10.219
Nice jacket.

02:10.286 --> 02:11.553
Is that from the shoot?

02:11.621 --> 02:13.622
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's from the shoot.

02:13.689 --> 02:14.789
Simon gave it to me.

02:14.857 --> 02:16.657
Kind of a token
of a job well done.

02:16.725 --> 02:18.893
We did it, buddy.
The team.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.362
But why did you get the jacket?

02:21.430 --> 02:23.764
Oh, hey, it's not a big deal,
you know.

02:23.832 --> 02:25.766
The point is he's the
boss and he noticed us.

02:25.834 --> 02:27.535
This jacket symbolizes
our success.

02:27.602 --> 02:30.271
If I get a jacket,
it's like we both get a jacket.

02:30.339 --> 02:32.273
But only you got a jacket.

02:32.341 --> 02:33.440
Which fits you great.

02:33.508 --> 02:35.242
I'm Zach, by the way.

02:35.309 --> 02:36.510
- Mikaela.
- Hi.

02:36.578 --> 02:37.611
Hi.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.613
Team.

02:42.651 --> 02:43.717
This is so unfair.

02:43.785 --> 02:45.285
You know what it is?

02:45.353 --> 02:46.820
It's your typical copywriter/
art guy dynamic.

02:46.888 --> 02:49.355
You talk more in the meetings,
so you get all the credit.

02:49.423 --> 02:51.024
He thinks that Simon

02:51.025 --> 02:52.324
likes me better than him.

02:52.392 --> 02:53.359
Zach attack!

02:53.427 --> 02:54.594
Whoo-ooh!
Whoo-ooh!

02:54.662 --> 02:55.628
Wah!
Wah!

02:55.696 --> 02:56.896
Huh! Huh! Ooh!
Huh! Huh! Ooh!

02:58.766 --> 02:59.666
Hi, Simon.

02:59.733 --> 03:01.500
Hey, Andrew.
Um, Dad?

03:01.569 --> 03:03.302
Hmm? A guy just delivered a box
of ducklings to your office.

03:03.370 --> 03:05.403
They're here.
It's for my pro bono project.

03:05.471 --> 03:07.238
You mean we're
not getting paid.

03:07.306 --> 03:09.374
But I'm saying it in Latin
so it has a certain gravitas.

03:09.442 --> 03:11.543
What's going on?
Remember Arrowhead Pond?

03:11.611 --> 03:13.712
It was an environmental disaster
back in the '80s.

03:13.780 --> 03:14.846
Terrible, awful, really.

03:14.914 --> 03:16.347
Well, that pond
has been restored,

03:16.415 --> 03:17.549
and I'm personally raising
these ducks

03:17.617 --> 03:18.857
to be its very first residents.

03:18.918 --> 03:20.618
Well, why are you
raising the ducks?

03:20.686 --> 03:21.819
Because they can't take care
of themselves, sweetheart.

03:21.887 --> 03:23.020
Why you?

03:23.088 --> 03:25.289
Some people see me
as I am and ask why.

03:25.356 --> 03:26.958
Can I get a straight answer?

03:27.025 --> 03:29.026
No, but you can get a gay one...
because ducks are fabulous!

03:29.094 --> 03:31.963
I say it like that because
Gay Brad is out today.

03:32.030 --> 03:34.431
I suppose he's out
every day, really.

03:34.499 --> 03:36.700
So you're telling me you're
raising ducks in the office?

03:36.701 --> 03:38.702
Honey, the time for that
disapproving tone

03:38.769 --> 03:41.370
is when I'm making
these poor decisions.

03:44.742 --> 03:45.742
It's okay, Tesla.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.410
They don't nest in trees.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.012
Well, maybe he's an outlier.
They live in ponds.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.379
Well, we don't have a pond.

03:50.447 --> 03:51.547
He'll just have to make do.

03:51.616 --> 03:52.776
Oh, and it seems like he did.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.049
Did you look over
my coffee campaign?

03:54.117 --> 03:55.417
It was brilliant,
it was perfect.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.551
But if you were gonna tweak it?

03:56.620 --> 03:57.519
I'd start again from scratch.

03:57.587 --> 03:58.954
Here we go.

03:59.022 --> 04:00.723
There's always room
to aim higher.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.758
There was once was a man named
Michael, last name Angelo.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.760
Michelangelo. Yes. And when
he was sculpting his David,

04:04.828 --> 04:06.695
do you think he finished
the torso and went,

04:06.763 --> 04:07.763
"Hey, va bene, tutti finito"?

04:07.831 --> 04:08.963
Guessing not.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.632
No, he slapped a penis
on that Adonis,

04:10.699 --> 04:12.500
and the rest was history.
You know what I'm saying?

04:12.567 --> 04:14.301
I need a penis?
That's my girl.

04:14.369 --> 04:16.004
Sydney, there's magic in you.

04:16.071 --> 04:17.911
I've known that since
the moment you were born.

04:17.973 --> 04:19.673
I looked down and said,
"Oh, my God..."

04:19.742 --> 04:21.509
"She's missing a penis."
But I still named you Sydney.

04:21.576 --> 04:22.744
The campaign works.
Honey...

04:22.811 --> 04:24.345
The focus groups like it.
Pumpkin...

04:24.412 --> 04:26.013
Stop calling me food.
You're playing it safe.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.048
And the best things in life come
from not playing it safe.

04:28.116 --> 04:29.750
It's a good campaign.
Listen, I'd love

04:29.817 --> 04:31.618
to argue with you,
but I think it's a lost cause.

04:31.686 --> 04:33.020
Besides, I've gotta go finish
my Crest campaign

04:33.087 --> 04:34.755
and chop up some worms
for my ducks.

04:34.822 --> 04:37.057
Ciao, ragazza.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.359
And then our guy walks outside.
Mm-hmm.

04:39.426 --> 04:42.094
It's a bright sunny day,
the pretty girl passes by,

04:42.162 --> 04:45.364
and he flashes her that
winning Crest smile.

04:45.431 --> 04:47.432
Suddenly, the sun
glinting off his teeth

04:47.500 --> 04:48.768
like a laser pointer

04:48.835 --> 04:50.636
blinds her and everyone
else in the vicinity

04:50.704 --> 04:53.839
as our hero mutters an
apology and crosses off!

04:53.907 --> 04:55.107
Andrew.

04:56.609 --> 05:00.344
"Crest, sunglasses
not included."

05:00.412 --> 05:01.412
Oh, I love it.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.347
Oh, great work, Zach.

05:03.415 --> 05:05.884
You know, Simon, a lot of that
was actually Andrew's idea.

05:05.951 --> 05:07.652
Let's not do this.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.788
I'm confused. Didn't I say
you guys did a great job?

05:09.855 --> 05:11.890
Well, technically, you just
said Zach did a great job.

05:11.957 --> 05:13.490
I did, didn't I?

05:13.558 --> 05:14.892
Also, I think Andrew's
a little upset

05:14.959 --> 05:16.827
because I got a jacket
and he didn't,

05:16.895 --> 05:18.428
even though I explained to him

05:18.496 --> 05:19.763
how me sleeping with the girl
who liked the jacket

05:19.831 --> 05:21.699
is gonna be a victory
for both of us.

05:21.766 --> 05:23.667
I'm still not seeing that.
But seriously, Simon, it's fine.

05:23.735 --> 05:25.803
No, no, it's not fine. I mean,
I know what goes into a pitch.

05:25.870 --> 05:27.671
I know you both worked on this.

05:27.739 --> 05:29.105
Maybe it's just 'cause
he talks more in the meetings.

05:29.173 --> 05:30.673
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

05:30.741 --> 05:31.941
Maybe I like you more
on a subconscious level.

05:32.009 --> 05:32.875
Getting more hurtful.
I should know better.

05:32.943 --> 05:34.543
A boss can't be doing this.

05:34.611 --> 05:35.945
He can't play favorites.

05:36.013 --> 05:37.680
I'm gonna make an effort
to be a little more fair.

05:37.748 --> 05:39.481
You know,
spread the love around.

05:39.549 --> 05:41.017
Zach, give Andrew the jacket.

05:41.085 --> 05:42.418
Huh?

05:42.485 --> 05:43.586
Words without actions
are meaningless.

05:43.653 --> 05:44.893
Okay. I think Stalin said that.

05:44.954 --> 05:46.588
Well, if he didn't,
he should have.

05:46.655 --> 05:48.090
There you go. Let go.
Andrew, come on, come on.

05:48.157 --> 05:49.891
There you go.
Try that puppy on there.

05:49.959 --> 05:51.999
Wow, it's my-my very first
leather jacket, actually.

05:52.061 --> 05:53.895
And how does that feel?
It feels, uh...

05:53.963 --> 05:55.964
it feels pretty great.

05:56.032 --> 05:57.565
You know what?
It looks better on Zach.

05:57.633 --> 05:58.834
It's me. It's me.
Give it back, yeah.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.068
I just can't unsee Zach

06:00.136 --> 06:01.736
in that jacket. Come on.
Good try, bud.

06:01.803 --> 06:03.670
It's okay. We'll find something
that will...

06:03.739 --> 06:04.671
We're gonna crack this thing.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.140
We'll figure it out, bud.

06:06.208 --> 06:08.168
And with this targeted
bus-and-billboard campaign,

06:08.176 --> 06:10.410
we project increased growth
in public awareness

06:10.478 --> 06:11.812
for Windy City
over the next five years.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.080
What do you think?

06:13.148 --> 06:14.815
Well, it's certainly
along the lines

06:14.883 --> 06:16.950
of what we hope to do,
you know, sales-wise.

06:17.017 --> 06:19.452
I guess we were hoping for
something a little more...

06:19.519 --> 06:21.087
Penis... exciting.

06:21.155 --> 06:23.422
We want to edge up
our brand a little bit.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.892
Well, what's exciting
is reliable sales growth.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.027
You know, what's edgy is, uh,

06:28.095 --> 06:29.963
increased market share.

06:30.030 --> 06:31.697
Lauren, what do you...
what do you think?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.766
Oh, I'm just the assistant,
but I would definitely

06:33.833 --> 06:35.634
sleep with a
Windy City Coffee drinker

06:35.701 --> 06:38.003
based on the strength of this
bus-and-billboard campaign.

06:38.071 --> 06:40.072
Well, I mean, it does
have its merits.

06:40.140 --> 06:41.140
Yeah.

06:41.207 --> 06:42.641
What about a spectacular?

06:42.708 --> 06:43.809
They don't want a spectacular.

06:43.877 --> 06:45.010
Oh, you're right.

06:45.078 --> 06:46.611
It's too big, it's too exciting.

06:46.679 --> 06:47.545
Not your thing.

06:47.613 --> 06:48.613
Hey, we want big.

06:48.681 --> 06:49.762
Yeah. What's a spectacular?

06:49.815 --> 06:51.215
Sydney?

06:52.818 --> 06:55.186
It's a media event designed
to get attention.

06:55.254 --> 06:57.889
Like when Red Bull parachuted
that guy from outer space.

06:57.956 --> 06:58.923
Yes!
Let's do that!

06:58.991 --> 07:00.557
Exactly that.
Yeah!

07:00.625 --> 07:02.894
They already did that.
That's how we know about it.

07:02.961 --> 07:04.095
Lauren, what do you think?

07:04.163 --> 07:05.762
I'd give it up
to spectacular guy

07:05.830 --> 07:07.097
way quicker than billboard guy.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.032
That's enough, Lauren.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.733
And Sydney's spectacular will be
even better than Red Bull's.

07:10.802 --> 07:12.562
It'll be stunning,
stupendous, extraordinary.

07:12.603 --> 07:14.004
You're literally just saying adjectives.
We're in.

07:14.071 --> 07:15.505
We haven't even pitched
you a specific.

07:15.572 --> 07:17.073
It could be anything!
We love that.

07:17.141 --> 07:18.775
Anything, anybody,
she can do it.

07:18.843 --> 07:20.510
We love her!
Welcome to my world!

07:20.577 --> 07:21.543
Yeah!
Let's do it!

07:21.611 --> 07:22.511
She's gonna figure it out!

07:22.578 --> 07:23.512
Yeah!
Spectacular!

07:23.579 --> 07:25.480
Game on! Yeah!

07:25.548 --> 07:26.615
Abbondanza.

07:26.683 --> 07:28.050
What was that?!

07:28.118 --> 07:30.519
Now I have to come up
with the biggest idea ever?

07:30.586 --> 07:32.706
Not ever, just in the history
of American advertising.

07:32.755 --> 07:33.755
I don't do big.

07:33.824 --> 07:35.191
I do steady.
I do dependable.

07:35.258 --> 07:36.891
I'm not you.

07:36.959 --> 07:38.659
Honey, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

07:38.727 --> 07:40.561
Sorry. I'm not supposed
to call you food.

07:40.629 --> 07:42.530
I'm just happy you moved on
from the penis metaphor.

07:42.597 --> 07:44.799
Yeah, I think I beat
that one to death.

07:44.867 --> 07:46.534
Sorry. Did that rub you
the wrong way?

07:46.601 --> 07:47.535
Blah...!

07:47.602 --> 07:49.003
It's not that hard, really.

07:49.071 --> 07:51.739
It's a stiff challenge,
but I know you're up to it.

07:53.141 --> 07:54.942
You guys bring out
the worst in me.

07:55.009 --> 07:56.109
It's amazing.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.993
Feel terrible about
this Andrew thing.

08:03.021 --> 08:04.922
I want to do something
special for him.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.724
You know, something that says,

08:06.792 --> 08:08.993
"I see you every day,
but now I actually see you."

08:09.061 --> 08:10.695
You slap that sentiment
on a mug,

08:10.762 --> 08:12.162
I think you got
one happy Andrew.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.965
Maybe I could take
him to a Bulls game.

08:14.032 --> 08:15.866
You know, the Heat are
in town this week.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.101
- Yeah, you could do that.
- What?

08:18.168 --> 08:20.704
I just thought the Bulls games
were kind of our thing.

08:20.771 --> 08:22.105
True. I hated it
when I said it.

08:22.172 --> 08:23.873
God, this is hard.

08:23.941 --> 08:26.576
Why did you have to look so
much better in that jacket?

08:26.644 --> 08:27.844
Sorry, boss.

08:27.912 --> 08:29.646
It's these damn
swimmer's shoulders.

08:29.714 --> 08:31.314
Yeah. Hey, maybe
I can let Andrew

08:31.381 --> 08:33.115
take point with me on
this duck-raising thing.

08:33.182 --> 08:35.583
I was looking for backup.
I was hoping you would do it,

08:35.652 --> 08:36.852
but, you know...
What exactly would that entail?

08:36.919 --> 08:38.186
There's cage cleaning,

08:38.254 --> 08:40.054
bottle feeding
and this thing called "venting"

08:40.056 --> 08:42.625
where you use a tiny brush
to clean the duck's anus.

08:42.692 --> 08:45.160
They need help.
They don't have sphincters.

08:45.228 --> 08:47.162
And their mom's not around
to lick them, so...

08:47.230 --> 08:48.630
You know what?

08:48.697 --> 08:49.631
What?

08:49.665 --> 08:50.965
Let Andrew take this one.

08:51.033 --> 08:53.668
You're a good friend.

08:59.942 --> 09:01.843
Well, I spent half the night
with the team

09:01.910 --> 09:03.111
banging our heads
against the wall.

09:03.178 --> 09:04.698
And then I finally sent
everybody home,

09:04.712 --> 09:06.613
and then I banged my head
some more, and then

09:06.681 --> 09:07.981
I finally cracked it.
The spectacular?

09:08.049 --> 09:10.117
Yes. And it's amazing.
Why is she upset?

09:10.184 --> 09:11.745
'Cause I was right.
You could do better.

09:11.786 --> 09:12.986
Fine, all right, there's
genius within me.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.320
I get it. There's no
limit to the heights

09:14.388 --> 09:15.989
I can achieve in this
industry. You win.

09:16.057 --> 09:18.258
I'm sorry I had to be
the one to break it to you.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.292
Well, what is it?

09:19.360 --> 09:20.826
It's simple, but it's big.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.162
Wow.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.297
Oh...

09:25.365 --> 09:26.926
All you need
is a giant bottle of scotch

09:26.967 --> 09:28.768
and you have my breakfast
during college.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.335
Okay, it's an optical illusion.
See, there's a pipe that runs

09:30.403 --> 09:31.971
from the cup all the way up
to the carafe that's hidden

09:32.039 --> 09:33.238
by the falling coffee.
Mm-hmm.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.907
And wait for it.
This is the best part.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.108
It's three stories tall.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.308
Wow, Syd, that's fantastic.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.342
Nice rendering.

09:38.410 --> 09:39.711
Andrew did it.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.780
Andrew, eh?
That's a job well done.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.181
It's about to be noticed

09:43.248 --> 09:45.216
and rewarded.

09:45.284 --> 09:46.851
That's it.
The important thing

09:46.919 --> 09:48.853
to remember when
cleaning a duck's anus

09:48.921 --> 09:50.254
is to go against the feathers.

09:50.322 --> 09:51.990
That's it...
against the feathers.

09:52.058 --> 09:54.158
Oh, okay. Okay. Other way.
That's it. That's it.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.693
You having fun, buddy?
Oh, yeah.

09:55.760 --> 09:56.960
Hey, you guys want

09:57.028 --> 09:58.696
to grab some lunch?
Uh, I don't know

09:58.763 --> 09:59.863
how hungry I am.

09:59.931 --> 10:00.964
Hey, you missed a
spot right there.

10:01.032 --> 10:02.192
Look, uh, Simon, I don't mean

10:02.201 --> 10:03.867
to seem ungrateful
or anything, but...

10:03.935 --> 10:05.736
What?
What is it?

10:05.804 --> 10:08.906
Uh, I so appreciate you trying
to do something nice for me.

10:08.973 --> 10:11.841
The thing is, this specific thing...
Uh-huh?

10:11.909 --> 10:13.276
I-I don't totally get it.

10:13.344 --> 10:14.377
- Listen.
- Yeah?

10:14.445 --> 10:16.145
I know that on the face of it

10:16.214 --> 10:17.714
it doesn't seem that glamorous,

10:17.781 --> 10:20.116
but this whole pond cleanup thing...
Mm-hmm.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.718
Isn't just a tax write-off.

10:21.785 --> 10:23.986
It's the pond where my dad
used to take me fishing.

10:24.054 --> 10:26.422
And I hope one day to take
my grandkid fishing there...

10:26.489 --> 10:28.090
if Sydney could ever sustain
a relationship.

10:28.157 --> 10:30.158
So this is really
important to you.

10:30.227 --> 10:33.229
It's the most important
assignment I could give anyone.

10:33.296 --> 10:35.364
- Huh.
- Huh.

10:35.432 --> 10:37.333
I don't think I'll be going
to lunch today, either.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.236
Andrew and I have some
important matters to attend to.

10:44.172 --> 10:46.441
You may want to use your pinky,
'cause you can't get

10:46.508 --> 10:48.109
all the gunk out
with just a toothbrush.

10:48.176 --> 10:49.444
♪ Imagine me and you

10:49.511 --> 10:51.112
♪ And you and me

10:51.179 --> 10:53.448
♪ No matter how
they tossed the dice ♪

10:53.515 --> 10:55.182
♪ it had to be

10:55.251 --> 10:57.351
♪ The only one for me is you

10:57.452 --> 10:59.253
♪ And you for me

10:59.320 --> 11:04.391
♪ So happy together

11:04.459 --> 11:06.393
♪ I can't see me

11:06.461 --> 11:09.863
♪ Loving nobody but you

11:09.930 --> 11:12.299
♪ For all my life

11:12.367 --> 11:15.167
♪ When you're with me

11:15.235 --> 11:17.270
♪ Baby, the skies will be blue

11:17.337 --> 11:21.140
♪ For all my life

11:21.207 --> 11:22.875
♪ When you're with me

11:22.942 --> 11:25.444
♪ Baby, the skies will be blue

11:25.512 --> 11:27.780
♪ For all my life...

11:27.847 --> 11:30.014
With a push
of this ceremonial button,

11:30.082 --> 11:32.016
Daley Plaza will transform

11:32.084 --> 11:33.351
into Windy City Coffee Plaza!

11:33.419 --> 11:34.980
No deal was actually made
with the city.

11:34.987 --> 11:36.187
Daley Plaza remains
the official name.

11:36.255 --> 11:37.822
Sydney...

11:37.890 --> 11:39.324
Enjoy free coffee, Chicago!

11:41.193 --> 11:42.260
Yeah!

11:47.899 --> 11:48.799
Here you go.

11:48.866 --> 11:49.966
- Scone?
- Thank you.

11:51.135 --> 11:53.337
It's truly spectacular.

11:53.405 --> 11:54.805
You did it, Sydney.

11:54.872 --> 11:55.806
Thanks, Lauren.

11:55.873 --> 11:56.940
Nobody thought you could.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.168
What? I push you hard, honey,

11:58.209 --> 11:59.410
because I know
how great you can be.

11:59.477 --> 12:00.477
And now everybody
knows it, too.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.745
I'm so proud of you, sweetie.

12:02.813 --> 12:05.014
That's my daughter's
penis up there.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.110
Did you
bring a duck with you?

12:08.118 --> 12:09.452
What? No.

12:10.921 --> 12:13.323
Scotty gets separation anxiety.

12:13.390 --> 12:14.324
Shh.

12:14.391 --> 12:16.225
Papa's here.

12:16.293 --> 12:17.392
Papa's here.

12:17.460 --> 12:19.127
It's a little windy today, huh?

12:20.162 --> 12:21.196
Is it starting to rain?

12:21.263 --> 12:22.397
It's not supposed to.

12:22.465 --> 12:24.132
Honey, how are you
containing the liquid?

12:24.200 --> 12:26.000
Some sort of
wind-guard, or...?

12:26.068 --> 12:27.001
Wh...

12:27.069 --> 12:28.337
Uh-oh.

12:28.404 --> 12:30.004
What?

12:31.273 --> 12:32.507
You feel that?

12:32.575 --> 12:34.508
Hey.
It's raining coffee!

12:34.576 --> 12:36.496
Everybody, get out of the way!

12:38.000 --> 12:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:45.520 --> 12:47.154
Don't forget to

12:47.222 --> 12:49.522
grab a free scone
while you're fleeing!

12:49.590 --> 12:50.590
Is that hazelnut?

12:50.658 --> 12:52.158
Because it's delicious, really.

12:55.535 --> 12:57.737
They are calling it
the dry cleaning bills

12:57.762 --> 12:59.896
to end all dry cleaning bills.

12:59.964 --> 13:02.333
Local chain Windy City Coffee

13:02.400 --> 13:04.335
attempted what
a spokesperson referred to

13:04.402 --> 13:05.702
as a "spectacular."

13:05.769 --> 13:07.303
But when things went awry,

13:07.371 --> 13:09.505
what went down
will be remembered

13:09.573 --> 13:12.908
for a long time
as a spectacular failure.

13:12.976 --> 13:15.378
Oh, that's clever how they
used the word against you.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.614
I destroyed
an entire city block.

13:17.681 --> 13:19.215
I'm like a supervillain.

13:19.283 --> 13:21.683
Oh, come on, nobody could have
anticipated this.

13:21.751 --> 13:23.252
That was an unusual
amount of wind.

13:23.319 --> 13:24.353
Thank you.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.687
Although it is literally called

13:25.755 --> 13:26.688
Windy City Coffee.

13:26.756 --> 13:27.756
And this is

13:27.823 --> 13:29.258
the Windy City.

13:29.325 --> 13:31.260
Ooh, someone's getting
a little peckish.

13:31.327 --> 13:32.567
I should get back.
Feeding time.

13:32.629 --> 13:34.229
Hey, you know what?
I can feed them.

13:34.297 --> 13:35.564
Yeah, yeah.

13:35.632 --> 13:36.898
I mean, I should help
with the ducks, too.

13:36.966 --> 13:37.898
Team.

13:37.966 --> 13:38.899
Yeah, yeah, but the ducks,

13:38.967 --> 13:40.368
that's kind of my gig.

13:40.435 --> 13:41.902
It's true.
He's proven himself

13:41.970 --> 13:43.437
to be the man for the job.

13:43.505 --> 13:44.838
Also, the ducks
have imprinted on him.

13:44.906 --> 13:46.474
They now believe
he's their mother.

13:46.541 --> 13:48.609
Hey, may I speak with
you for a moment?

13:48.677 --> 13:49.677
- Yeah.
- Come on.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.944
So, uh...

13:51.012 --> 13:52.012
what was that back there?

13:52.013 --> 13:53.213
What?

13:53.281 --> 13:54.247
The ducks are
my thing with Simon,

13:54.315 --> 13:56.349
and now... you're jealous.

13:56.417 --> 13:58.418
I am not jealous.

13:58.486 --> 13:59.886
- Oh?
- I don't get jealous.

13:59.953 --> 14:01.788
Oh, no, I-I truly believe that.

14:01.855 --> 14:03.890
I-I do. I believe
that that is an emotion

14:03.957 --> 14:06.359
you are not fully capable
of understanding.

14:06.427 --> 14:07.587
That's how good your life is.

14:07.628 --> 14:09.762
But see, today...
I'm the one

14:09.829 --> 14:12.264
that's buddying around
with Simon, so...

14:12.332 --> 14:14.232
How... how does that
make you feel?

14:15.001 --> 14:16.502
I don't really like it.

14:16.569 --> 14:18.904
You-you kind of wish
the roles were reversed?

14:19.939 --> 14:21.407
A little bit, yeah.

14:21.474 --> 14:22.708
You got, like,
an emptiness in your stomach,

14:22.776 --> 14:24.410
a pit that you can't quite name?

14:24.477 --> 14:25.810
Maybe.

14:25.877 --> 14:29.013
That, my friend, is jealousy.

14:34.753 --> 14:36.321
Can I hold the duck
for a little bit?

14:36.388 --> 14:38.323
I'm sorry, no.

14:44.495 --> 14:45.429
Sweetie, you tried.

14:45.496 --> 14:46.630
That's the important thing.

14:46.698 --> 14:48.365
Yep, I tried and I failed.

14:48.433 --> 14:49.833
I told you I'm not you.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.968
Your problem is, you don't
see me for my imperfections.

14:52.036 --> 14:53.403
Please, not the Yoda
birthmark again.

14:53.471 --> 14:54.871
But it looks just like him.

14:54.939 --> 14:56.780
I'm saying that my big
ideas don't always work.

14:56.808 --> 14:59.475
I've had some spectacular
failures of my own.

14:59.543 --> 15:01.544
You know that pond
I've been helping

15:01.611 --> 15:03.579
to recover from
the environmental disaster?

15:03.647 --> 15:06.816
Well, that disaster
was all my fault.

15:06.883 --> 15:08.417
What are you talking about?

15:08.485 --> 15:10.319
It was back in the '80s.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.621
A large crowd had gathered
for what was being called

15:12.689 --> 15:14.823
the spectacular
to end all spectaculars.

15:14.890 --> 15:16.358
And the sponsor

15:16.425 --> 15:18.326
was America's favorite
saliva-powered candy:

15:18.394 --> 15:19.561
Pop Rocks.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.696
I poured tons and
tons of that stuff

15:21.764 --> 15:23.331
into that pond.

15:23.399 --> 15:24.999
I was hoping for maybe
a little fizzing, you know,

15:25.067 --> 15:26.300
a little crackling.

15:26.369 --> 15:27.635
No.

15:27.703 --> 15:28.770
It was a pink eruption.

15:28.838 --> 15:30.871
It was like a Pop Rock Pompeii.

15:30.938 --> 15:34.074
It was my PopRockalypse Now.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.542
I remember seeing

15:35.610 --> 15:37.745
little kids covered in pink,
crying.

15:40.815 --> 15:41.882
And the noise, just...

15:43.685 --> 15:46.619
It was like
the devil's flatulence.

15:46.687 --> 15:48.621
Sales blew up.

15:48.689 --> 15:50.956
But so did a lot of the fish.

15:51.024 --> 15:53.826
My point is, baby,
I know failure.

15:53.894 --> 15:55.695
Thanks, Dad.

15:55.763 --> 15:56.763
You're welcome, kitten.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.330
Uh-oh.

15:58.399 --> 16:00.299
Another e-mail from
the Windy City people.

16:00.367 --> 16:01.333
They are not happy.

16:01.401 --> 16:02.601
It's okay.

16:02.668 --> 16:04.002
We're gonna figure this out.

16:04.069 --> 16:05.003
Yes, we are!

16:05.070 --> 16:06.037
I believe in you!

16:06.105 --> 16:08.039
Check it out!
We're on TV.

16:08.107 --> 16:09.875
Christie Moon,
channel four news.

16:09.942 --> 16:11.877
We were hoping to get a few
words from the perpetrator,

16:11.944 --> 16:13.478
if you have a moment.
Uh, sorry...

16:13.546 --> 16:14.746
Yo, everybody, I'm famous!

16:14.814 --> 16:15.781
What, what!

16:15.848 --> 16:17.015
Oh, this just in:

16:17.082 --> 16:18.348
new footage of people fleeing.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.484
It's raining coffee!

16:20.552 --> 16:22.085
Everybody out of the way!

16:26.691 --> 16:29.927
It was like something
out of a horror movie.

16:35.599 --> 16:38.802
It was a
beautiful day in sunny Chicago.

16:38.869 --> 16:40.670
Until...

16:43.874 --> 16:45.007
It's raining coffee!

16:45.075 --> 16:47.410
The attack of the killer coffee!

16:49.179 --> 16:50.546
That's actually quite tasty.
Whoa!

16:50.613 --> 16:52.748
Run for your lives!

16:55.151 --> 16:57.018
Windy City Coffee.

16:57.086 --> 16:58.921
Dangerously good.

17:01.891 --> 17:04.358
That's what I'm talking about.

17:04.426 --> 17:05.693
Edgy, edgy.

17:05.761 --> 17:07.027
We also have
a red-band version

17:07.095 --> 17:08.596
we'd like to leak
online with your permission.

17:08.664 --> 17:10.104
There's a particular girl
whose shirt

17:10.131 --> 17:11.810
gets just the right
amount of soaked. Um...

17:11.867 --> 17:12.800
is it possible...

17:12.867 --> 17:13.867
We'll e-mail
you the link.

17:13.868 --> 17:15.936
Awesome.

17:22.609 --> 17:23.609
Everyone's here.

17:23.678 --> 17:24.877
We can start whenever you want.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.546
There's a lot of diabetic frogs

17:26.614 --> 17:28.414
who've been waiting
20 years for this.

17:28.483 --> 17:30.083
Hey, Simon, are we sure
that it's a good idea

17:30.150 --> 17:31.511
to release these ducks
into nature?

17:31.519 --> 17:32.552
I mean, what if
they're city ducks?

17:32.620 --> 17:34.420
Sorry, Andrew, but it's time.

17:34.489 --> 17:35.822
I'm gonna miss you, little guy.

17:35.890 --> 17:38.591
I'm gonna miss you, too.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.960
Said the duck.
Ah.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.462
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:43.530 --> 17:44.797
you're all here today

17:44.865 --> 17:46.499
because you've been
part of the effort

17:46.566 --> 17:49.134
to bring life back to this
beautiful body of water.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.871
Others were quick to walk away,

17:51.938 --> 17:54.138
declaring it just another
candy-related catastrophe

17:54.206 --> 17:56.941
like the gobstopping
of the Chicago River in '82,

17:57.009 --> 17:59.076
or the Nerd melt of '81.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.814
But today is proof
of what happens

18:02.882 --> 18:05.617
if you dare to dream big
and work small.

18:05.684 --> 18:09.020
There were days I didn't know
if we'd succeed.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.488
But if I've learned
one thing in this life,

18:11.556 --> 18:13.089
there's no shame in failing.

18:13.157 --> 18:14.958
The only shame

18:15.026 --> 18:17.127
is in not giving things
your best shot.

18:19.664 --> 18:21.197
Thank you for that smattering.

18:21.265 --> 18:24.601
And now,
to quote Jacques Cousteau...

18:24.669 --> 18:26.135
...it is time to restore things

18:26.202 --> 18:27.803
back to their natural order.

18:27.871 --> 18:30.139
To get back
to the way things were.

18:30.206 --> 18:33.208
Andrew, release the quackens!

18:33.276 --> 18:34.810
I'm gonna miss you guys.

18:34.878 --> 18:36.679
But I'm gonna come
and visit you every Sunday.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.521
Scott, I'm gonna bring you
your favorite bread.

18:38.549 --> 18:40.149
Sharon, you're gonna
meet someone.

18:40.216 --> 18:41.750
You're so beautiful.

18:41.817 --> 18:43.151
David... Andrew,
it's time to go.

18:43.218 --> 18:44.619
I'll talk to you Sunday, David.

18:46.556 --> 18:47.522
Go.

18:47.590 --> 18:48.557
Swim away.

18:48.624 --> 18:49.658
Be free.

18:50.860 --> 18:51.793
I release you.

18:51.861 --> 18:53.595
On your way, now.

18:54.664 --> 18:56.865
What are you guys doing?

18:56.933 --> 18:57.998
Come on, get out of here.

18:58.066 --> 18:59.800
Scram.

18:59.868 --> 19:02.736
Do you realize how hard
you're making this for me?

19:03.872 --> 19:05.205
Yeah, they're not moving.

19:05.273 --> 19:07.541
Guess we'll have
to keep them after all.

19:08.610 --> 19:10.744
There is another possibility.

19:12.881 --> 19:14.480
Come on!

19:14.548 --> 19:15.615
Come on, duckies.

19:15.683 --> 19:17.149
Over here.

19:17.217 --> 19:18.685
Good, Taylor.

19:19.987 --> 19:21.087
That's it!

19:21.154 --> 19:22.154
Yeah, keep going!

19:23.924 --> 19:25.524
Poor guy.
It's a little chilly out.

19:25.593 --> 19:26.659
Are you cold, buddy?

19:26.727 --> 19:28.088
Oh, no, I'm good.
I got the jacket.

19:28.128 --> 19:29.595
Yeah, you do.

19:29.662 --> 19:31.663
How long do you think
he has to stay in there?

19:31.731 --> 19:33.665
Just a couple of hours,
till they get acclimated.

19:33.733 --> 19:34.800
There you go!

19:34.867 --> 19:36.201
Little further.
Good work, Andrew!

19:36.268 --> 19:37.202
You proud of me?

19:37.269 --> 19:38.971
Yeah, buddy, you did great!

19:39.038 --> 19:39.938
They love you!

19:40.006 --> 19:41.673
Thanks, Da... Simon.

19:41.741 --> 19:44.009
Go.

19:44.026 --> 19:47.483

19:47.536 --> 19:48.837
Swim away!

19:48.865 --> 19:50.399
You are free now!

19:50.467 --> 19:52.001
Oh, that's
not right. Sorry.

19:52.068 --> 19:54.536
There they go.

19:54.604 --> 19:56.171
Four out of five dentists agree

19:56.239 --> 19:57.639
it was the worst environmental
disaster of the '80s.

19:57.707 --> 19:59.441
It was like a
Candyland Chernobyl.

19:59.509 --> 20:01.009
They found Nemo.
He was all over.

20:01.043 --> 20:03.144
The bubbling, the bubbling,
the bubbling, the bubbling...

20:03.212 --> 20:05.579
It was like a fart from hell.

20:05.647 --> 20:06.914
You can do it, Dorothy.

20:06.982 --> 20:08.483
A girl with a good
pair of shoes

20:08.550 --> 20:09.717
can go a long way.

20:09.784 --> 20:11.064
Stop it.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.920
We put every metaphor we could

20:12.988 --> 20:14.122
in everything we tried.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.590
How long can we
make this riff go?

20:17.658 --> 20:19.026
Till the end of time.
