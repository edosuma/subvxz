YOU GAVE HER EVERY CHANCE
TO WALK AWAY FROM HER DEED.

00:31.632 --> 00:36.104
- NO, IT AIN'T ABOUT
WHAT I GAVE HER.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.440
- SHE THREW HER LIFE AWAY
ON AN EMPTY IDEAL.

00:39.473 --> 00:43.144
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.716

01:17.811 --> 01:19.580
DELANEY IS NOT HALF THE MAN
YOU ARE.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.582

TREAT HIM RIGHT.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.784

08:54.301 --> 08:55.903
GET OUT.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.707

A NATIONAL VOICE.

FOR NOTHING.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.540
- YEAH?
HOW'S THAT?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.943
- PESTILENTIAL GRASSHOPPER
HAS BROUGHT PLAGUE

12:22.976 --> 12:24.411
TO THIS CITY THAT HAS LEFT

12:24.444 --> 12:28.916
A LACK OF CIRCULATING CURRENCY
AND A SURPLUS OF LABORERS.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.820
I HAVE MADE A DEAL
WITH BRIGHAM YOUNG FOR 800 MEN.

12:32.820 --> 12:37.991
HAVEN'T LEFT A HIRABLE WORKER
WITHIN 500 MILES.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.327

- YES, SIR.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.963

IS CRESTING SHERMAN PEAK.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.136
- HE IS.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.906
- AND THAT HIS NEW STEAM ENGINE
SHOVEL WAS YOUR INVENTION.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.274
- IT WAS.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.109
- THEY TELL ME SOMETHING
ELSE, TOO.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.846
THAT YOU QUIT THE U.P.

12:58.846 --> 13:02.449
IS THAT TRUE?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.455
WELL, I AM CURIOUS.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.991
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO THIS MECCA
OF POLYGAMIST PRETENSION?

13:11.024 --> 13:13.994
- SEARCHING FOR MY WIFE
AND MY BOY.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.896
THINK THEY MIGHT BE HERE.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.597
SHE'S MORMON.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.366
EXCUSE ME.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.502

BRIGHAM YOUNG IS RUMORED

13:26.306 --> 13:30.310
BY 96 FEET WIDE
TO ACCOMMODATE HIS 55 WIVES.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.346
I DO HOPE YOURS

13:38.585 --> 13:39.519
- YOU KNOW WHAT THE WAGONS COST.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.455
MY BROTHER BROKE IT
DOWN TO THE RED CENT.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.623
HE DOES THE FIGURING.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.192
IT'S A FAIR PRICE.

13:50.097 --> 13:53.934
- THE FIGURES DON'T TELL ALL,
MR. SPINOZA.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.305

OF STARIN',

13:58.338 --> 14:00.007
LET US KNOW IF WE GOT A DEAL.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.576
- YOU ARE SPEAKING
WITH GOD'S HIGH MINISTER.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.546
PROFANITY WILL NOT DO.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.916
- BROTHER GUNDERSEN.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.328

14:21.361 --> 14:22.930
THAT'S A SAVINGS.

14:22.930 --> 14:27.567

ZEKE.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.671
HE'S GOD'S WHATSIT.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.607
JUST LIKE LAST TIME, MR. YOUNG.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.944
THE NUMBERS IS WHAT THEY ARE.

14:36.944 --> 14:42.115
- AND WHAT THEY ARE IS TOO HIGH,
MY BENIGHTED FRIEND.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.951
LOWER YOUR PRICE

14:43.984 --> 14:46.954
IF YOU WISH TO TRANSPORT
OUR MORMON WORKMEN WEST.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.422
- WHAT I WISH FOR
IS FOR FAIR PROFIT.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.629
- I HAVE CONSULTED AND PRAYED...

15:00.500 --> 15:04.037
AND HERE IS WHAT I WILL PAY.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.989

SOMEWHERE ELSE.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.596
ZEKE.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.267

BROTHER GUNDERSEN.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.408

THE POLLUTING VAPORS.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.742
- [chuckles]

15:42.775 --> 15:45.145
I TAKE IT THE PRICE

IN THE MORNING.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.568
- WILL I STILL BE PRETTY
WHEN THIS HEALS UP?

21:12.639 --> 21:15.375
- SHOULDN'T BE BAD,
YOU CARE FOR IT.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.747
YOUR GIRLS ARE GETTING HURT
AND CUT UP BY CUSTOMERS.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.515
- WHAT BUSINESS
IS THAT OF YOURS?

21:22.549 --> 21:25.352
- WELL, THE GIRLS
COME TO ME, IS ALL.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.355
THEY AIN'T BEING LOOKED AFTER.
- I'M LEAVING CHEYENNE.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.390
I'M TAKING 'EM WITH ME,

21:30.423 --> 21:33.460
SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.662
- TAKING 'EM WHERE?
- WEST.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.597
- CHEYENNE'S BEEN
HARD ON EVERYONE.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.466
DON'T MEAN YOU RUN.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.768
- [laughs]

21:41.801 --> 21:44.371
CAMPBELL GAVE ME A CHOICE.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.539
I CHOSE ME LIFE.

21:46.573 --> 21:50.443
- FINE.
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.514
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.649
- THEM GIRLS NEED CARING FOR,
MICKEY.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.519
I-I'LL SEE TO 'EM,
TEND TO 'EM,

21:59.552 --> 22:01.554
AND KEEP 'EM IN LINE.

22:01.588 --> 22:04.857
- MAKE YOU MADAM, YOU MEAN?

22:04.891 --> 22:06.859
- PARTNER.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.462
- YOU NEED MONEY
TO BUY INTO A PARTNERSHIP.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.498
- I GOT MONEY.

22:11.531 --> 22:15.535
I RECKON THIS'LL BUY ME 15%.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.504

SHH.

23:24.504 --> 23:25.772

23:25.805 --> 23:29.609
- YOU FIND THE GOOD STUFF,
HARRY?

23:29.642 --> 23:31.778
- HE DID.

23:33.613 --> 23:38.785
OH.
A BOTTLE MISSING...

23:38.818 --> 23:41.220
- WHERE'S HARRY?
- YOU WILL READ HERE,

23:41.253 --> 23:45.825
THE ARRANGEMENT AS MUCH
AS BROTHER BRIGHAM PROPOSED.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.669
- IMPOSSIBLE...

23:56.703 --> 23:59.506
- YOU ARE PLEASED, BROTHER?

24:05.512 --> 24:07.013
- HAVE THE MONEY RELEASED.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.682
- GOOD.

24:09.716 --> 24:12.785
BECAUSE, IF I MAY...

24:12.819 --> 24:15.655
- GO AHEAD.

24:15.688 --> 24:20.092
- I AM MOST HAPPY
TO HAVE BEEN ABLE,

24:20.126 --> 24:21.961
IN MY SMALL WAY,

24:21.994 --> 24:24.697
TO FORWARD
HEAVENLY FATHER'S WORK,

24:24.731 --> 24:28.668
AND IT IS MY HOPE--

24:28.701 --> 24:31.804
I AM BOLD, NOW, I KNOW--

24:31.838 --> 24:35.708
YOU CAN SEE
WHAT I HAVE DONE HERE.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.779
THE IMPOSSIBLE, YOU HAVE SAID.
- MM.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.648
- YOU REALIZE WHAT I
COULD ACCOMPLISH THERE,

24:41.681 --> 24:45.618
AMONG OUR WORKERS
ON THE CENTRAL PACIFIC?

24:48.688 --> 24:50.557
- YOU WISH TO JOIN HUNTINGTON?

24:50.590 --> 24:52.291
IS THAT IT?

24:52.324 --> 24:55.595
I HAVE ANSWERED YOU ONCE.

24:55.628 --> 25:00.700
- I JOIN NO ONE.

25:00.733 --> 25:04.704
I AM YOUR SERVANT,

25:04.737 --> 25:06.806
AND THE LORD'S.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.308
NEVER HUNTINGTON'S.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.678
THERE AS HERE,

25:11.711 --> 25:13.713
I LOOK AFTER OUR INTEREST

25:13.746 --> 25:19.619
AND THE SOULS
OF OUR MORMON BRETHREN.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.588
YOU SEE NOW

25:21.588 --> 25:26.125
HOW I MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE?

25:45.978 --> 25:48.715
- YOU...

25:48.748 --> 25:50.783
- YEAH.

25:50.817 --> 25:53.052
I COME FOR NAOMI...

25:53.085 --> 25:56.055
AND WILLIAM.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.725
ARE THEY ALIVE?

26:03.763 --> 26:05.632
[sniffles]

26:05.632 --> 26:08.768
WHERE ARE THEY?

26:08.801 --> 26:13.740
- [whispers] I PRAYED...
HE'D TAKE ME...

26:13.773 --> 26:16.709
NOT THEM.

26:16.743 --> 26:20.046
I PRAYED...

26:20.079 --> 26:22.649
- WHERE ARE THEY, MOTHER HATCH?

26:25.785 --> 26:27.987
- WEST...

26:28.020 --> 26:32.792
WHERE YOU'LL NEVER FIND THEM.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.695
AWAY FROM YOU.

26:46.706 --> 26:49.308
- I'LL STAY WITH YOU,
MOTHER HATCH.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.343
[coughing in background]

26:55.214 --> 26:59.786
I'LL WATCH YOU DIE.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.488
I'LL MAKE SURE
THEY BURN YOU GOOD.

27:06.358 --> 27:09.829
WHEN I FIND NAOMI,

27:09.862 --> 27:15.267
I'LL TELL HER
YOU WERE MISERABLE TO THE END.

27:15.301 --> 27:20.339
WHEN MY SON GROWS OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW HIS GRANDPARENTS...

27:23.776 --> 27:27.747
I WILL MAKE SURE
HE NEVER HEARS YOUR NAME.

27:33.252 --> 27:39.258

27:41.027 --> 27:43.429
[gasps, liquid gurgles]

27:57.877 --> 28:01.748
- MR. BOHANNON?

28:03.349 --> 28:04.751
MR. BOHANNON?

28:08.755 --> 28:10.757
REST EASY, BROTHER BOHANNON.

28:10.757 --> 28:14.226
SHE DIED PEACEFUL,
KNOWING YOU WERE HERE.

28:19.899 --> 28:23.202
- YOU LISTEN TO ME.

28:23.235 --> 28:28.374
SHE WAS A VENGEFUL WOMAN.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.310
SHE DIED THE SAME.

28:37.216 --> 28:40.853
[background conversation]
[wagons rattling]

28:54.566 --> 28:57.069
- MR. BOHANNON.

28:57.103 --> 29:01.808
GOOD-BYE, SIR.
I'M JUST LEAVING FOR CALIFORNIA.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.810
DID YOU FIND YOUR FAMILY?

29:03.810 --> 29:05.878
- SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.479
THEY AIN'T HERE.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.048
- WELL, SIR,

29:09.081 --> 29:11.918
YOU HAVE THE VISAGE OF A MAN
WHO COULD USE A DRINK.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.820
- SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW
FOR THAT TOO.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.922
AIN'T HERE.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.157
- WELL, THEN IT IS FORTUITOUS
THAT YOU HAVE RUN INTO ME.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.525
[pats wagon]

29:25.131 --> 29:27.233
COME ALONG, SIR.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.836
LET US IMBIBE IN OUR COMFORT.

29:37.844 --> 29:41.147
- COME IN, WHY DON'T YOU?

29:41.180 --> 29:44.183
- THE CHEYENNE PALACE IS MINE.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.853
THE COMFORT HOUSE IS MINE.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.288
JAILHOUSE ACROSS THE STREET...

29:49.321 --> 29:50.990
MINE.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.893
THE HOTEL...

29:53.926 --> 29:56.863
WILL BE MINE,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.098
NOW, THAT LEAVES

29:59.131 --> 30:02.434
JUST ONE OUTSTANDING ITEM.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.904
- WHICH IS?

30:07.039 --> 30:09.842
- CHICKEN HILL.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.945
ACCEPT MY OFFER
OF FAIR MARKET VALUE

30:12.979 --> 30:16.482
OR SURRENDER IT
TO THE U.S. CAVALRY,

30:16.515 --> 30:19.551
WHO WILL BIVOUAC THERE UNTIL
PERMANENT BARRACKS

30:19.585 --> 30:21.988
CAN BE CONSTRUCTED.

30:32.264 --> 30:36.035
- [exhales]
YOU WANT CHICKEN HILL?

30:36.068 --> 30:37.904
TAKE IT.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.574
THERE'S THE DEED.

30:42.608 --> 30:47.546
NOW, IF YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF
MY DESK, IT'S YOURS.

30:49.048 --> 30:54.553

31:20.112 --> 31:22.048

31:22.081 --> 31:23.983

31:41.267 --> 31:43.135
- HOW 'BOUT THAT?

31:43.169 --> 31:46.105
[both panting]

31:57.683 --> 31:58.985
[thwack, squish]
- OW!

32:02.354 --> 32:04.423
[women giggling]

32:16.202 --> 32:19.038
[thud]
- OH!

32:23.275 --> 32:25.011

- AH!

[scattered laughter]

32:38.057 --> 32:40.326

32:40.359 --> 32:42.594

33:02.548 --> 33:05.684

I'LL GIVE YOU...

33:05.717 --> 33:09.421
DOUBLE FAIR MARKET VALUE.

33:12.224 --> 33:15.527
- TRIPLE.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.130
- DONE.

33:20.232 --> 33:23.635
- THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS
I CAN'T SOLVE, MR. BOHANNON.

33:23.669 --> 33:28.674
BUT LOCATING WHISKEY IN THIS
SOBER PLACE IS NOT ONE OF 'EM.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.577
[chuckles]

33:33.745 --> 33:36.082
IT'S CALLED VALLEY TAN,

33:36.115 --> 33:40.519

IMPORTED FIRE AND BRIMSTONE.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.093
- [coughs]

33:47.093 --> 33:48.227
- [chuckles]

33:53.232 --> 33:56.102
NOW, LOOKING
FOR YOUR WIFE AND SON...

33:56.135 --> 33:58.204
THAT'S AN AMBITIOUS UNDERTAKING,

33:58.237 --> 34:01.540
ESPECIALLY FOR AN AMBITIOUS MAN
LIKE YOURSELF.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.542
BUT I'M CURIOUS,
HOW DO YOU BEGIN?

34:03.575 --> 34:04.610
WHERE DO YOU START LOOKING?

34:04.643 --> 34:06.112
- I ONLY STARTED HERE.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.579
NOW I'M HEADING WEST.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.182
- MM-HMM.

34:11.650 --> 34:15.121
THE MORMON FAITHFUL...

34:15.154 --> 34:20.726
ARE 80,000 STRONG,
COVERING ALMOST AS MANY MILES.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.195
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR PLAN,

34:23.229 --> 34:25.564
"HEAD WEST,"

34:25.597 --> 34:30.136
IS GUARANTEED TO DO ONLY
ONE THING, HMM?

34:30.169 --> 34:34.606
FAIL.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.275
THAT BEGS THE QUESTION

34:36.308 --> 34:39.145
HOW BADLY DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO FIND YOUR FAMILY?

34:42.148 --> 34:47.286
- THANK YOU FOR THE DRINK.
BUT I PREFER ROTGUT.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.555
- IF ROTGUT
IS ALL THAT YOU HAVE HAD,

34:49.588 --> 34:52.191
ROTGUT IS ALL YOU PREFER.

34:52.224 --> 34:56.495
CENTRAL PACIFIC COULD EXPAND
YOUR PREFERENCES, MR. BOHANNON.

34:56.528 --> 34:57.796
- UH-HUH.
- MR. BOHANNON,

34:57.829 --> 35:02.568
THERE IS A BETTER WAY
TO FIND YOUR FAMILY.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.204
IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.777
I PLAN TO DRIVE MY ROAD

35:11.810 --> 35:13.245
RIGHT INTO THE HEART
OF MORMON COUNTRY,

35:13.279 --> 35:17.249
FROM CALIFORNIA ALL THE WAY
TO SALT LAKE CITY.

35:17.283 --> 35:21.287
THERE IS NOTHING THAT WILL
HAPPEN IN MORMON COUNTRY

35:21.320 --> 35:24.623
THAT I WON'T KNOW ABOUT
OR CAN'T FIND OUT ABOUT.

35:24.656 --> 35:27.293
NOW, IF YOU WORK FOR ME,

35:27.326 --> 35:29.895
ALL OF MY RESOURCES
WILL BE AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

35:33.332 --> 35:36.235
YOUR FAMILY'S OUT THERE,
WE'LL FIND 'EM.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.537
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

35:40.406 --> 35:43.209
- SOUNDS LIKE I'D BE BACK
TO WORKING ON THE RAILROAD.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.676
I'VE DUG THAT DITCH.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.678
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN DIGGING A DITCH

35:46.712 --> 35:48.814
AND OWNING IT, SIR.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.292
NOW, WE WILL FIND YOUR FAMILY,

36:00.326 --> 36:03.729
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO,

36:03.762 --> 36:06.632
BUT THIS TIME,
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

36:06.665 --> 36:08.900
YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING
TO SHOW THEM FOR ALL YOUR WORK,

36:08.934 --> 36:12.271
MORE THAN A CANVAS TENT
AND A MUD FLOOR.

36:14.373 --> 36:18.277
I'M PREPARED TO OFFER YOU
A SMALL INTEREST IN MY COMPANY.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.748
