WEBVTT

01:07.734 --> 01:09.194
Our figures match yours, Helios.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.905
There is no way
those other ships can overtake us.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.869
I guess it's time
to break out that champagne!

01:16.952 --> 01:19.204
Outstanding.

01:20.038 --> 01:23.625
And I'm sure it's especially sweet to you
that NASA will reach Mars dead last.

01:23.709 --> 01:24.751
Roger that.

01:25.752 --> 01:30.215
I think we got that Interstellar
Exploration Prize sewn up for you, Dev.

01:30.799 --> 01:31.884
It's not for me.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.053
The day we win…

01:36.471 --> 01:39.474
I'm giving the entire Helios team
an equal slice of that prize money.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.355
Jesus, that's gotta be like…

01:45.439 --> 01:46.648
Like 20,000 a person.

01:47.232 --> 01:51.820
And we have beat the world's superpowers
at their own game!

02:02.372 --> 02:03.373
Look at that.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.795
A lone ember in the night sky.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.134
Compared to the sun,
infinitesimally small.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.265
We built that fire…

02:22.351 --> 02:24.853
all of us, together.

02:28.524 --> 02:29.650
And that fire…

02:31.735 --> 02:33.695
will take us all the way to Mars.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.872
All right!

02:47.501 --> 02:49.127
-All right.
-Phoenix, Sojourner 1.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.672
Phoenix, Sojourner 1. Over.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.801
Sojourner 1, this is Phoenix.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.470
Welcome to deep space, Danielle.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.055
I gotta hand it to you, Ed.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.016
After we left lunar orbit,
we pressed the pedal to the metal.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.478
But our nukes would've sucked up too much
prop to get us to Mars ahead of you.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.230
What can I say?

03:08.313 --> 03:12.359
Innovation and out-of-the-box thinking
wins the day every time.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.152
You're right about that.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.780
How's my daughter?

03:18.615 --> 03:20.826
-I'm good.
-That's good to hear, kiddo.

03:20.909 --> 03:25.455
I'm just sorry your old man
had to whup you so bad.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.292
But I did warn ya.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.960
Being first isn't everything, Dad.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.506
Well, you keep her safe, Danielle.

03:34.590 --> 03:38.218
And thanks for a great race.
You pushed us to excel.

03:38.302 --> 03:41.138
It was my pleasure, bud. Sojourner out.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.269
Mr. Halladay.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.229
Standing by, Captain.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.314
Beat to quarters.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.773
To quarters. All hands!

03:51.857 --> 03:52.858
Clear the decks!

03:52.941 --> 03:54.067
Batten down the hatches!

03:54.151 --> 03:55.777
Cut the jib, you scalawags.

03:55.861 --> 03:59.531
Ms. Baldwin,
I believe we're in need of a chantey.

03:59.615 --> 04:00.824
Aye, Captain.

04:24.223 --> 04:29.269
Skipper, I'm getting
an odd broadcast from Sojourner.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.323
They've totally lost it.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.581
Stevens.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.253
Monitor their vector telemetry
and patch in the NASA video feed.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.129
-I want eyes on that ship.
-Copy.

05:09.226 --> 05:12.437
Helios Control,
Sojourner's up to something.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.522
Keep eyes on them.

05:17.234 --> 05:20.112
Sounds like they're ready
to rock and roll. Are we?

05:20.195 --> 05:22.948
Affirmative. Jolly Roger systems
show ready in all respects.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.659
Then let's do this thing.

05:26.869 --> 05:30.038
Sojourner 1, Houston.
How's the wind up there?

05:30.914 --> 05:31.915
Steady nor'easter.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.834
Then grab it.

05:33.917 --> 05:38.338
Sojourner 1 is go
for Operation Jolly Roger.

05:38.422 --> 05:42.009
Sojourner copies.
Go for Jolly Roger.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.848
Mr. Halladay, hoist the mainsail.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.185
Aye, Captain.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.866
Jesus, that solar sail's gonna pick up

06:05.949 --> 06:09.995
enough photon radiation pressure
to give Sojourner constant acceleration.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.084
They're gonna beat us by eight days.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.087
What can we do to retake the lead?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.549
I'm sorry, but the math says
it's just not possible.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.221
So we dump mass. What about pulsed burns?

06:27.304 --> 06:30.849
There's broken plane maneuvers
or a comet flyby--

06:30.933 --> 06:32.935
Those are all incredibly dangerous.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.980
Look, Dev, I know
that getting there first is important,

06:37.064 --> 06:39.691
but getting there in one piece
is more important.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.985
First is what matters, Karen.
It's the only thing that matters.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.404
First is what changes things.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.074
We dump their propellant reserves
if we have to.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.284
Phoenix can just make more fuel
once they get to Mars.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.578
No, even if we had enough propellant
to overtake Sojourner,

06:51.662 --> 06:54.706
we wouldn't have enough
to slow down to enter Mars orbit.

06:54.790 --> 06:58.752
Yeah, we're pushing a hotel out there.
It's too much mass, not enough--

07:12.015 --> 07:14.101
Phoenix, Sojourner 1.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.436
Ed, I wish I could see
the look on your face

07:16.520 --> 07:20.190
when you run the numbers and realize
we beat your ass to Mars.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.234
Well played, Danielle.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.320
I learned from the best.
Sojourner out.

08:55.118 --> 09:00.499
NASA's surprise unveiling of a solar sail
has upended the race to Mars

09:00.582 --> 09:03.710
and will likely bring the American craft
to the Red Planet

09:03.794 --> 09:06.630
a full week before its competitors.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.800
Director of Roscosmos, Lenara Catiche,

09:09.883 --> 09:13.262
has accused the United States
of playing dirty tricks,

09:13.345 --> 09:18.725
but still insists that the Soviet Union
can and will win the race.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.436
A lot of folks here at home
are cheering on NASA,

09:21.520 --> 09:24.773
but there's also
a vocal and growing minority

09:24.857 --> 09:27.943
calling out the space program
and President Wilson.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.152
What's their gripe?

09:29.236 --> 09:33.949
This so-called clean energy
of helium-3 nuclear fusion.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.326
President Wilson hailed it
as a miracle fuel

09:36.410 --> 09:38.829
that will save us from global warming.

09:38.912 --> 09:43.166
But it is the blue-collar workers,
the coal miners, the oil workers

09:43.250 --> 09:45.878
who are now bearing the price
for this progress.

09:45.961 --> 09:50.299
Last month, the Wilson administration
introduced a new jobs bill

09:50.382 --> 09:51.633
with great ballyhoo.

09:51.717 --> 09:55.179
Wilson claimed it would equip
displaced fossil fuel workers

09:55.262 --> 09:57.556
to compete in the new economy.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.600
But I'm not buying it.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.811
All right, Mr. Speaker,
let's cut to the chase here.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.605
What's this all about?

10:04.688 --> 10:05.939
Well, Madam President,

10:06.023 --> 10:07.482
unfortunately, the Congress

10:07.566 --> 10:11.445
will not be able to support
your fiscal year budget proposal.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.780
You've gotta be kidding.

10:14.323 --> 10:15.574
I wish I were.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.329
You sat on that very couch last week
and agreed to these budget cuts.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.456
I said I was open to exploring them.

10:22.539 --> 10:26.126
No, you promised that if we raised taxes,
you would support them.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.211
So what changed?

10:27.294 --> 10:30.547
My members have been getting
a lot of blowback from their constituents.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.175
Do you have any idea how much incoming
we're taking from Gingrich?

10:33.759 --> 10:36.303
Dick, we have a historic opportunity

10:36.386 --> 10:39.306
to strike a grand bargain
and balance the budget

10:39.389 --> 10:41.934
and show the American people
that bipartisanship can work.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.728
And I believe we can strike that bargain,

10:44.811 --> 10:47.147
if you're willing
to explore other avenues.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.860
-Such as?
-NASA.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.697
What about it? NASA's self-funding.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.407
It's a good deal more than that.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.494
Margo Madison has built an oligarchy

11:00.577 --> 11:03.872
that generated
$75 billion in profits last year,

11:03.956 --> 11:05.582
and she doesn't like to share.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.251
If we could tap into that revenue--

11:07.334 --> 11:11.255
Absolutely not.
That money finances our Mars program,

11:11.338 --> 11:14.591
which, if you haven't noticed,
is on track to make history.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.176
Madam President,

11:16.260 --> 11:20.722
the Mars race plays great on cable news
and at DC cocktail parties,

11:20.806 --> 11:22.933
but there's a lot of people
out there in the heartland

11:23.016 --> 11:25.686
wondering what Mars has to do with them.

11:26.270 --> 11:30.816
Coal, oil and natural gas industries
are in free fall.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.069
So now you care
about the oil industry, huh?

11:34.152 --> 11:36.321
I care about all of America, Jim.

11:37.155 --> 11:41.410
Whole towns in Texas and Appalachia
are closing down, wiped out by helium-3

11:41.493 --> 11:44.663
and the other advances brought on
by the space program.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.541
You've seen the protests.
These people are fed up.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.209
I'm not tapping NASA.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.045
I step foot on that slippery slope,

11:52.129 --> 11:54.923
and Congress will drain the agency
of all its cash.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.801
That's a shame.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.929
As I'm sure you're aware,

12:01.013 --> 12:03.307
if we don't find a compromise
in the next two weeks,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.142
you'll have to shut down the government.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.311
If we do, the public will blame you.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.897
I wouldn't be too sure
you can close that sale.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.775
People look to their president
to solve these difficult problems.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.863
And that's
exactly what I'm going to do, Dick,

12:18.572 --> 12:20.407
with or without your help.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.952
Well, I thank you for your time,
Madam President,

12:24.036 --> 12:26.330
and look forward to
speaking with you again.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.623
I'll see you out.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.760
Fatuous bastard.

12:39.843 --> 12:43.931
Who the hell does he think he is,
issuing an ultimatum like that?

12:51.230 --> 12:52.564
Could you all give us a minute?

12:52.648 --> 12:53.774
Thank you.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.448
Thanks.

13:05.911 --> 13:06.954
How you doing?

13:11.834 --> 13:15.128
You remember the first day
we stepped into this office?

13:16.797 --> 13:17.798
Of course.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.844
Everything felt possible…

13:23.887 --> 13:26.723
like we could really change things.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.938
Now it just feels like a job.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.607
We are changing things.
It just takes time.

13:36.567 --> 13:39.736
I mean, an American is about to be
the first one to set foot on Mars.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.738
And you made that possible.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.949
I wish I could've been there…

13:46.410 --> 13:47.995
when they unfurled that sail.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.419
Okay, so let's go.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.754
-To JSC?
-Yeah.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.464
You haven't been back since the election.

13:59.548 --> 14:02.426
You can congratulate everyone
on a job well done.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.511
And I think it'd be good
for you too, you know.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.388
Get back to your roots.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.057
It does sound nice, actually.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.934
Not to mention it'll be a great photo op.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.520
-Larry.
-What?

14:13.604 --> 14:15.939
We could use
all the positive coverage we can get.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.320
Yeah.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.739
I guess we could.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.449
Good morning, outer space.

15:07.533 --> 15:11.245
You're listening to the first and only
pirate radio station

15:11.328 --> 15:15.541
exclusively serving
the inner solar system.

15:18.043 --> 15:21.505
If you're listening out there,
I'm your DJ, Kelly Baldwin.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.882
Hope you're enjoying the tunes.

15:24.967 --> 15:28.428
As the only humans
for about a million miles,

15:28.512 --> 15:31.390
there's nothing like a little music
to bring us all together.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.976
And as always, if you have any requests,

15:34.059 --> 15:39.606
you can reach me on my private
radio frequency, 6.8 megahertz.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.316
Now, why don't we go around the horn?

15:41.400 --> 15:46.280
The temperature in Houston today is
18 degrees Celsius.

15:46.864 --> 15:49.408
At Shackleton Crater, it's minus 157.

15:51.243 --> 15:55.497
Venus will hit a balmy 482 degrees
by late afternoon.

15:56.164 --> 15:59.251
And on Mars in Valles Marineris,

16:00.043 --> 16:03.088
it's 21 Celsius with clear skies.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.507
I like the sound of that.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.997
It's, like, been Whac-A-Mole
all week long with this thing.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.083
Relax. Could be worse.
We could have his job.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.590
Latest from the waste recycler.

16:49.426 --> 16:53.430
Drink it today,
piss it tomorrow, eat it the day after.

16:53.514 --> 16:56.850
Jesus, Zizzo. There's some things
I'd rather not think about.

17:03.565 --> 17:04.983
Caesar salad?

17:09.238 --> 17:10.280
Good as you're gonna get up here.

17:10.364 --> 17:12.657
Zizzo, I owe you big.

17:18.664 --> 17:21.834
Okay, Louisa, comm check on channel one.
How do you hear?

17:21.916 --> 17:22.960
Loud and clear on one.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.878
Roger loud and clear.
Going to channel two.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.632
Switching to channel two now.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.801
Switching to Ka band.
How do you read?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.804
Five by five with Ka band.

17:34.471 --> 17:35.556
Copy.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.310
Loud and clear.
Good on delta as well.

17:40.394 --> 17:43.605
The race to Mars continues
to capture the imagination

17:43.689 --> 17:45.607
of people across the country.

17:46.984 --> 17:50.028
And the space merchandise industry
is cashing in.

17:50.821 --> 17:54.116
With interest in space travel
the highest it's been--

17:54.199 --> 17:58.036
…wants to get in on the Mars race.
According to sources at the Pentagon,

17:58.120 --> 18:02.124
the North Korean space program sent
their own unmanned probe to the Red Planet

18:02.207 --> 18:05.043
in the weeks prior to the launch
of Sojourner 1.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.589
The North Korean program has struggled
to keep pace with other nations

18:08.672 --> 18:12.134
and is still on the defensive after
debris from one of their failed rockets

18:12.217 --> 18:13.343
brought about the Polaris--

18:13.427 --> 18:15.179
…part of a complete breakfast.

18:16.847 --> 18:19.433
Welcome back to Morning USA.

18:20.434 --> 18:23.562
And now to our continuing series
on the crew of Sojourner 1,

18:23.645 --> 18:25.939
America's first manned mission to Mars.

18:26.023 --> 18:28.442
Now, last week we took you
to the Scottish Highlands

18:28.525 --> 18:30.360
to see Clarke Halladay's upbringing.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.112
Today, we take a closer look

18:32.196 --> 18:35.782
at another international member
of NASA's crew, Rolan Baranov,

18:35.866 --> 18:40.621
the former cosmonaut who famously defected
to the United States in 1983

18:40.704 --> 18:42.372
during the Jamestown crisis.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.375
Baranov, a former Soviet military officer

18:45.459 --> 18:48.837
with PhDs in geology
and structural engineering,

18:48.921 --> 18:50.506
was a provocative choice,

18:50.589 --> 18:54.885
as many in the Soviet Union still
consider him a traitor to their nation.

18:55.719 --> 18:57.679
They call at least three times a day,
Rolan.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.723
I can't take it anymore.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.266
Just ignore them.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.018
You've been here for ten years.

19:03.101 --> 19:06.396
I don't understand why they continue
to harass you about this.

19:06.480 --> 19:10.150
I'm sorry.
Can we talk about something else?

19:11.527 --> 19:12.611
Okay.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.113
So the sink is still leaking.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.281
Which one?

19:16.365 --> 19:18.283
The same one that always leaks.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.035
Hey, Anne.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.662
-Hi, Will.
-Hi, Will.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.038
What's up, little man?

19:23.121 --> 19:26.375
Watch over Rolan, Will.
He needs supervision.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.668
Say goodbye, Peter.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.336
-Bye, Daddy. Bye, Will.
-Goodbye.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.343
My family likes you
more than my family likes me.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.513
Well, I'm twice as smart
and extremely handsome, so…

19:39.596 --> 19:40.931
Yeah, true.

19:41.014 --> 19:44.685
Feeling parched up here.
Can somebody grab me a juice pouch?

19:44.768 --> 19:47.145
Copy, Skipper. I think we can remedy that.

19:47.980 --> 19:48.981
I'll just borrow this.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.566
Terrorist.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.071
Thanks, man.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.745
As requested.

20:03.829 --> 20:05.205
Why, thank you, Sylvie.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.666
Pull up a chair. Enjoy the view.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.505
Looks a whole lot like it did yesterday.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.884
And the day before that.
And the day before that.

20:17.885 --> 20:20.596
-Just like an ant farm.
-What?

20:22.055 --> 20:25.392
Nothing. Just a little inside joke.

20:26.143 --> 20:29.855
Don't worry. We are gonna have
some new scenery here soon enough.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.528
Man. I cannot wait
to set her down in Happy Valley.

20:36.612 --> 20:38.071
Melas Chasma?

20:38.155 --> 20:39.573
It's "Happy Valley" to me.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.535
I remember the first time I saw it.

20:44.745 --> 20:47.956
It was in a picture book
in the big kids' library.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.416
And it just…

20:52.085 --> 20:53.086
made me happy.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.885
Orbital mechanics don't lie.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.094
We're fucked.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.931
NASA had it all figured
before they even left lunar orbit.

21:04.014 --> 21:07.518
If we had a photon torpedo,
we could blow 'em out of the sky.

21:08.185 --> 21:10.479
"I say we nuke the entire site from orbit.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.689
It's the only way to be sure."

21:13.649 --> 21:14.733
What is that, Wrath of Khan?

21:14.816 --> 21:17.027
No, you idiot. It's from Aliens.

21:18.654 --> 21:20.531
Oh, God. All right. Here we go.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.700
"Get away from her, you bitch!"

21:23.784 --> 21:24.910
Yes.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.329
Oh, no.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.581
Oh, man.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.041
My food.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.588
Do that bit from that film--

21:36.672 --> 21:38.715
What was it called? Love in the Sky.

21:38.799 --> 21:41.051
-Right. Wait, okay.
-Yeah.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.347
"Hey, I haven't seen
that blonde here before.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.182
Is she one of the new students?"

21:47.266 --> 21:50.227
"I don't know. Beats me, Gordo.
I haven't seen her here either."

21:51.395 --> 21:54.022
"How'd you like
a flying lesson, sweetheart?"

21:57.150 --> 21:58.402
Hey, guys. What's going on?

21:59.862 --> 22:01.738
Nothing. We're just shooting the shit.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.829
Hey, Nick. You got a minute?

22:10.831 --> 22:12.457
Sure, Danny.

22:27.806 --> 22:29.433
But you didn't do my favorite scene.

22:30.017 --> 22:31.518
Go ahead. Do it.

22:31.602 --> 22:32.936
Come on, Danny.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.064
You know how I feel about your parents. I…

22:37.149 --> 22:40.777
-I just was trying to lighten the mood.
-Here, I'll get you started.

22:43.071 --> 22:47.492
"Hey, Trace, grab that roll of duct tape
and wrap it around me.

22:47.576 --> 22:48.827
Tight, damn it!"

22:49.620 --> 22:51.496
-Danny.
-Go on.

22:52.915 --> 22:54.041
"Tight, damn it."

22:56.502 --> 22:58.003
"What are you thinking, Gordo?"

22:59.421 --> 23:01.548
"Thinking if I make a run
for that reactor,

23:01.632 --> 23:05.219
it just might be able to save
everyone in Jamestown."

23:06.720 --> 23:07.930
"That's crazy."

23:08.013 --> 23:09.014
Keep going.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.224
-Danny. Come on, please.
-Keep going.

23:10.307 --> 23:11.934
-I'm sorry. Okay? I--
-Nick.

23:13.185 --> 23:14.686
Don't you have some reports to generate?

23:14.770 --> 23:15.771
Yes, sir.

23:25.614 --> 23:28.450
Well, I didn't like
that movie much either, Dan.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.203
But a lot of people loved it,

23:32.120 --> 23:34.706
including some
that should've known better.

23:35.791 --> 23:38.043
I mean, Nick was there for Chrissakes.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.795
-That's no excuse.
-I know.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.424
But I'm counting on you
to help me lead this crew.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.635
And you do that by example.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.054
We talked about this.

23:49.137 --> 23:51.557
You've got to learn
how to control your temper.

23:55.185 --> 23:58.522
Believe me.
I mean, I know how hard that can be.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.401
We're stuck with these people
for a long-ass time,

24:02.484 --> 24:05.863
and I'm counting on you
to help make it work.

24:08.282 --> 24:09.491
Aye, aye, sir.

24:11.702 --> 24:14.329
You still haven't taken me up
on that game of Spades.

24:14.413 --> 24:17.249
Look, I got a deck with your name on it.

24:17.332 --> 24:21.587
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I just--
Everything's been really hectic.

24:21.670 --> 24:22.671
-Yeah.
-You know.

24:24.089 --> 24:26.592
Let's do it for sure. Soon.

24:33.182 --> 24:35.976
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

24:36.059 --> 24:38.896
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

24:41.899 --> 24:45.194
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

24:49.865 --> 24:52.492
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

24:52.576 --> 24:55.621
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

25:00.459 --> 25:02.878
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

25:08.217 --> 25:10.302
If you could talk to President Wilson
right now,

25:10.385 --> 25:11.595
what would you say to her?

25:11.678 --> 25:15.974
You and all your friends at NASA
and Helios are getting rich off helium-3.

25:16.058 --> 25:17.100
But what about us?

25:17.184 --> 25:20.562
My father worked the oil fields
and his father before him.

25:20.646 --> 25:21.647
Now it's all gone.

25:21.730 --> 25:22.981
Fuck NASA!

25:25.651 --> 25:29.905
Save our jobs!
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

25:29.988 --> 25:32.282
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

25:32.366 --> 25:35.702
Hey, aren't you Jimmy Stevens?
Son of Tracy and Gordo Stevens?

25:36.828 --> 25:38.622
I'm Jack Gould
with the Houston Sentinel.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.123
What brings you to the protest today?

25:41.875 --> 25:43.210
Fuck off.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.047
Those fucking leeches.

25:47.130 --> 25:50.133
They say they care about the truth,
but they really don't give a shit.

25:50.968 --> 25:52.928
Got that right.
They're all in NASA's pocket.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.056
I'm Sunny, by the way.

25:59.768 --> 26:03.105
Hey, so me and my friends are
just gonna hang out after this,

26:03.188 --> 26:04.356
grab some beers.

26:04.439 --> 26:05.440
You wanna come?

26:07.985 --> 26:09.361
Yeah.

26:09.945 --> 26:10.946
Cool.

26:12.197 --> 26:16.493
Save our jobs!
Save our jobs! Save our jobs!

26:36.388 --> 26:39.516
-Hello.
-Madam President, welcome back to NASA.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.601
Thank you.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.436
-I'll be your tour guide today.
-Great.

26:48.901 --> 26:49.943
Thank you.

27:03.290 --> 27:04.791
Feels good to be here.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.169
Because it's home.

27:17.262 --> 27:20.557
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

27:24.561 --> 27:25.437
Hello.

27:29.608 --> 27:35.197
Thank you. It's so good to see you.

27:39.368 --> 27:41.745
Jim. How's it going? Thank you.

27:43.705 --> 27:44.790
Never changes.

27:45.749 --> 27:48.836
We do the work.
The politicians grab the glory.

27:49.586 --> 27:50.796
But she's one of us.

27:50.879 --> 27:52.297
Not anymore, she isn't.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.758
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

28:02.850 --> 28:04.768
Madam President.

28:05.394 --> 28:07.729
Welcome back to Houston. We've missed you.

28:07.813 --> 28:08.814
Thank you, Margo.

28:10.023 --> 28:11.400
It's good to be home.

28:14.486 --> 28:19.032
Two years ago, you were asked to jettison

28:19.116 --> 28:23.453
all of your meticulous plans
and timetables

28:23.954 --> 28:28.125
and move up the launch of Sojourner
so we could beat Helios to the Red Planet.

28:29.626 --> 28:34.256
And many said
that NASA was too stuck in its ways,

28:34.840 --> 28:40.012
too weighed down with bureaucracy
and red tape to meet such a challenge.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.222
But you…

28:44.224 --> 28:48.270
you have shown the naysayers
what you are made of

28:48.353 --> 28:53.358
and restored our faith that,
when united behind a common goal,

28:53.442 --> 28:56.945
there is nothing
the American people cannot achieve.

29:03.035 --> 29:04.161
That was pretty good.

29:06.205 --> 29:09.917
And like Christopher Columbus's expedition
over 500 years ago,

29:10.584 --> 29:13.504
Sojourner has plunged into the unknown

29:14.171 --> 29:18.467
and is on the precipice of discoveries
that none of us can possibly anticipate,

29:18.550 --> 29:22.304
discoveries that will transform
all of our lives.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.431
And as a former astronaut--

29:26.058 --> 29:28.936
And one who once worked in this room…

29:31.063 --> 29:33.941
I want to thank you all
for your service to your country.

29:35.484 --> 29:36.568
Thank you.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.205
-Fuck you very much, NASA.
-Fuck you, NASA.

29:48.288 --> 29:49.373
Fuck you, NASA.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.632
Jimmy, do you know Charles?

29:59.299 --> 30:02.302
Charles used to work at NASA.
He was an astronaut.

30:03.011 --> 30:04.805
I was a moon Marine at Jamestown.

30:06.515 --> 30:07.641
My mom was up there.

30:07.724 --> 30:10.519
Yeah, I know.
I was up there with her in '83.

30:11.645 --> 30:12.896
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.314
She trained me on the LSAM.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.776
Let me tell you, she was one tough SOB.

30:23.073 --> 30:24.074
Yeah.

30:28.662 --> 30:29.830
Were you up there when--

30:32.332 --> 30:35.794
I was out on patrol at the claim site
when whatever happened went down.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.923
What do you mean "whatever happened"?

30:40.007 --> 30:42.009
Have you read the commission's report?

30:42.593 --> 30:43.594
Yeah.

30:44.261 --> 30:46.597
Look, I'm not saying
something didn't happen.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.183
But it ain't what they're saying,
that's for sure.

30:49.808 --> 30:51.977
It was a cover-up, man. Pure and simple.

30:52.769 --> 30:57.733
Vance Paulson was the best Marine,
the best astronaut, I ever met.

30:57.816 --> 31:01.153
And you're gonna tell me
he was shot in the back by a Russian?

31:01.236 --> 31:02.613
I don't think so.

31:02.696 --> 31:04.531
I mean, you gotta look at the whole thing.

31:04.615 --> 31:06.617
Why was there even an issue
with the reactor?

31:06.700 --> 31:08.744
I know it had a backup cooling system.

31:10.037 --> 31:12.706
-They're not telling us everything.
-I mean, think about it.

31:12.789 --> 31:14.291
After all that goes down,

31:14.374 --> 31:17.211
NASA and Russia divide up the moon
between them,

31:17.294 --> 31:21.131
and then they "discover" helium-3.

31:21.798 --> 31:26.136
I mean, it's the most valuable resource
in the last 500 years.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.639
You think it's a coincidence?

31:50.202 --> 31:52.663
Kelly's request hotline,
what do you wanna hear?

31:53.830 --> 31:55.666
I have problem.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.293
There is big problem.

31:58.377 --> 31:59.378
Who is this?

32:01.588 --> 32:03.048
Who is this?

32:03.131 --> 32:04.800
Mars-94?

32:05.384 --> 32:07.094
I'm on Russian ship.

32:07.177 --> 32:09.638
What? I'm having trouble hearing you.

32:10.806 --> 32:15.435
My crew, they are about
to do something very dangerous.

32:16.019 --> 32:18.522
They are determined to win race to Mars.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.315
What are they gonna do?

32:25.279 --> 32:26.446
You can tell me.

32:28.448 --> 32:30.951
I listen to you. Radio.

32:31.743 --> 32:33.787
Good Morning Outer Space.

32:33.871 --> 32:38.083
When you talk,
I think, "You can be trusted."

32:38.166 --> 32:40.169
Trusted. For what?

32:41.461 --> 32:44.006
To help us. If we took--

32:47.801 --> 32:51.263
-Hello? Hello?
-I have to go. I have to go.

32:51.346 --> 32:53.140
Are you there?

33:10.324 --> 33:14.286
It's basically boiled sheep's head.
The more you eat, the creepier it gets.

33:14.369 --> 33:16.705
Empty eye sockets looking back at you…

33:16.788 --> 33:17.956
Do you one better.

33:18.040 --> 33:22.085
Incubated duck egg, all feathery and beaky
so that the bones have a nice crunch.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.546
Jesus. What is wrong with you people?

33:32.596 --> 33:34.306
-What do we got?
-Telemetry from the Russians.

33:34.389 --> 33:35.641
Their delta V just took a big jump.

33:37.726 --> 33:39.102
They're changing their heading.

33:44.024 --> 33:45.067
Flight.

33:51.865 --> 33:54.451
Yeah, Russian telemetry is consistent
with a midcourse burn.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.328
Starting when?

33:56.995 --> 34:00.290
Factoring the transmission delay,
about five minutes ago.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.167
What's going on?

34:02.251 --> 34:04.837
The Russians have just fired up
their nuclear engines.

34:06.213 --> 34:10.092
You think this could be some sort of
trajectory correction maneuver?

34:10.175 --> 34:12.344
Too long for a TCM.
They're pushing it hard.

34:13.136 --> 34:15.138
I think they're trying
to get back in the race.

34:16.306 --> 34:19.726
And they just boosted
their TMI burn thruster by over 20%.

34:20.310 --> 34:22.938
That's way too much.
It could overtemp their engine.

34:31.822 --> 34:33.364
What are your people up to, Rolan?

34:33.447 --> 34:35.701
They want to win, of course.

34:38.286 --> 34:40.038
And they're not my people anymore.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.627
Those crazy Russkies sure got stones,
don't they?

34:46.420 --> 34:48.672
If they keep the burn up
for the next seven minutes,

34:48.755 --> 34:50.799
they'll beat Sojourner to Mars
by three days.

34:51.466 --> 34:52.759
Putting us dead last.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.277
That can't be right.

35:11.403 --> 35:14.489
Flight, something's going on.
The Soviet burn stopped too early.

35:14.573 --> 35:16.867
I'm putting their current trajectory
up on the board.

35:20.579 --> 35:21.705
Something's wrong.

35:21.788 --> 35:24.875
If their engines could fire,
they'd still be burning.

35:25.709 --> 35:28.045
This has to be a major malfunction.

35:28.921 --> 35:29.963
Get me the Russian ambassador.

35:31.131 --> 35:32.174
Good luck.

35:32.257 --> 35:35.093
The Soviets will never admit
if they've had an engine failure.

35:35.177 --> 35:36.595
I know.

35:36.678 --> 35:38.805
-Okay.
-Thank you.

35:42.184 --> 35:43.185
Mr. Ambassador.

35:52.653 --> 35:54.613
All right, here's the latest.

35:54.696 --> 35:56.031
The Russians have admitted

35:56.114 --> 35:58.158
that their nuclear engines are
in meltdown.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.452
They pushed 'em too hard.

36:01.036 --> 36:04.331
Goddamn it.
So what's the time frame for a rescue?

36:04.414 --> 36:07.918
Seventy-two hours before the radiation
kills everybody on board their ship.

36:08.585 --> 36:09.586
Jesus.

36:20.514 --> 36:21.515
Okay.

36:24.935 --> 36:25.978
We'll do it.

36:26.061 --> 36:29.439
Ed, you don't have enough prop
to pick up the Russkies

36:29.523 --> 36:31.316
and brake to enter Mars orbit.

36:31.900 --> 36:36.321
I know. Neither will you.
This rescue is a one-way ticket home.

36:37.322 --> 36:38.782
Think it through.

36:38.866 --> 36:42.286
Rendezvous with the Russians is gonna mean
some sticky flying,

36:42.369 --> 36:45.372
especially if their maneuvering systems
are all fouled up.

36:46.874 --> 36:50.502
I hate to break it to you, kiddo,
but I was doing mid-air refueling

36:50.586 --> 36:53.672
while you were learning how to read
Fun with Dick and Jane.

36:53.755 --> 36:55.549
It doesn't matter how good you are.

36:55.632 --> 36:58.552
That ship of yours flies
like a grand piano.

37:00.512 --> 37:04.683
She's not wrong, sir. Okay?
Maybe it's better if they just take this--

37:04.766 --> 37:07.311
If it was us breaking down
in the middle of outer fucking space,

37:07.394 --> 37:09.271
we'd want the same consideration,
don't you think?

37:14.776 --> 37:16.987
We can use our lander as a ferry.

37:17.070 --> 37:20.991
And we got a hell of a lot more space
up here for their crew than you do, so…

37:21.074 --> 37:23.577
I keep forgetting y'all got
a hotel and casino over there.

37:23.660 --> 37:25.204
Yeah, you should see our pool.

37:25.287 --> 37:27.623
At least you got
plenty of snacks for the ride home.

37:27.706 --> 37:29.750
I hope the Russians like pasta.

37:34.213 --> 37:37.049
All right.
You take the ball this time, Ed.

37:37.674 --> 37:41.929
Hey, at least you already know
I kicked your ass.

37:42.012 --> 37:43.388
So nothing's lost there.

37:46.517 --> 37:47.935
Anything you need.

37:48.018 --> 37:49.770
Fair winds. Phoenix out.

37:58.737 --> 38:02.449
All right, let's tap the brakes.
Meet up with those Russians.

38:02.533 --> 38:04.243
I calculated the burn. We're good to go.

38:04.326 --> 38:09.081
Danny, double-check his work and feed it
into the flight control computer. Clear?

38:09.164 --> 38:12.459
Louisa, I want you and Zizzo working
the consumables problem.

38:12.543 --> 38:15.546
We need to figure out
how to accommodate five more souls.

38:23.178 --> 38:26.557
I know how disappointing this is
for everyone.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.642
But bringing those folks home
safe and sound

38:28.725 --> 38:31.019
is more important than mission success.

38:31.687 --> 38:32.688
Okay…

38:33.939 --> 38:36.483
we'll be ready to go
by the time we get your response.

38:37.734 --> 38:38.735
Phoenix out.

38:43.323 --> 38:45.909
All right. Let's talk about this.

38:45.993 --> 38:49.538
So what do we think
about Ed's proposal to give up Mars?

38:51.081 --> 38:53.917
Well, if a ship's in trouble,
you go rescue it, right?

38:54.001 --> 38:56.545
That's been the law of the sea
since the dawn of time.

38:58.463 --> 38:59.965
I think we should help too.

39:04.761 --> 39:05.762
Anybody else?

39:07.431 --> 39:09.766
I mean, if we wanna hear
both sides of it, now would be the time.

39:11.018 --> 39:12.603
Heather, what do you think?

39:13.395 --> 39:16.940
I mean, we're not the only ship out there.

39:17.024 --> 39:19.318
Why should this fall on us?

39:19.401 --> 39:21.153
You mean, why not NASA?

39:21.236 --> 39:24.615
Because our ship can support
the extra crew far better than they can.

39:24.698 --> 39:28.952
So we're supposed to give up on Mars
because NASA designed a less capable ship?

39:29.036 --> 39:30.746
NASA's a government agency.

39:30.829 --> 39:33.624
They're obligated
to step up for stuff like this.

39:33.707 --> 39:36.627
And NASA's done joint missions
with the Russians before. But…

39:37.294 --> 39:39.338
Yes, and our crew has also
been trained by NASA,

39:39.421 --> 39:41.298
so they're more than capable of handling--

39:41.381 --> 39:42.466
Show of hands.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.843
Those in favor
of letting NASA handle the rescue?

39:55.646 --> 39:56.647
Well, that settles it.

39:58.065 --> 40:00.901
Tim, put in a call to Margo Madison.
Let me know when you have her.

40:01.818 --> 40:04.947
Hey, if they do this rescue,

40:05.030 --> 40:07.282
NASA's not gonna have enough fuel
to make it to Mars.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.701
Your point being?

40:13.372 --> 40:14.665
Is that really
why you're doing this?

40:16.166 --> 40:17.584
It was the group's decision.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.006
Right.

40:30.222 --> 40:33.100
We are united in our decision
to let NASA handle the rescue.

40:34.685 --> 40:36.103
Press forward to Mars.

40:38.063 --> 40:40.691
I'm sorry, Ed. I hope you understand.

40:45.362 --> 40:46.488
Okay.

40:47.406 --> 40:48.740
Nothing changes.

40:49.408 --> 40:51.076
We continue with the rescue mission.

40:52.244 --> 40:53.495
We're just going to ignore Dev?

40:55.497 --> 40:57.791
Give me an updated state vector
for the Russian vessel.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.336
You got a problem, Danny?

41:03.255 --> 41:04.256
No, sir.

41:06.633 --> 41:08.427
-Confirmed and entered.
-Very well.

41:13.348 --> 41:16.351
Prop tanks pressurization nominal.
Board is green.

41:16.435 --> 41:20.439
All hands, this is the commander.
Stand by for a course change burn.

41:20.522 --> 41:22.399
Adarsh, set the master arm to "on."

41:32.618 --> 41:33.994
Engine controls won't arm.

41:36.914 --> 41:40.167
Manual override won't engage either.
No response at all.

41:40.250 --> 41:43.712
Tank pressurization is dropping.
Feed valves just dropped off-line.

41:44.296 --> 41:45.422
We're not going anywhere.

41:46.548 --> 41:48.509
Check the communications uplink log.

41:56.517 --> 41:59.019
Software update came in
with the last message from ground.

41:59.102 --> 42:00.187
Software update.

42:00.270 --> 42:01.271
What is it?

42:02.606 --> 42:05.817
Dev Ayesa just locked me out of
my own spacecraft.

42:08.070 --> 42:10.572
No, I don't understand, Dev.

42:10.656 --> 42:14.076
Your ship can handle this rescue
far more effectively than ours.

42:14.159 --> 42:15.160
It--

42:16.411 --> 42:18.247
Don't give me that. No.

42:18.330 --> 42:21.458
You're jeopardizing lives
for your own selfish interests.

42:21.542 --> 42:22.584
But what else is new?

42:25.587 --> 42:27.297
He refuses to help.

42:27.381 --> 42:28.590
Jesus.

42:28.674 --> 42:29.925
Selfish bastard.

42:31.426 --> 42:34.304
-You have to force him to do it.
-How?

42:34.805 --> 42:36.557
Nationalize his company.

42:37.099 --> 42:39.810
Use your emergency powers.
It's been done before.

42:39.893 --> 42:42.646
You're suggesting we march
the National Guard over to Helios

42:42.729 --> 42:44.898
and commandeer private assets
for public use?

42:44.982 --> 42:46.358
Whatever it takes.

42:46.441 --> 42:49.319
Sometimes you have to ignore the politics
and do the right thing.

42:49.403 --> 42:51.113
This is the right thing, Margo.

42:51.196 --> 42:55.158
It's what NASA does best.
Saves lives, leads by example. Remember?

42:57.870 --> 43:00.038
That's more important than winning a race.

43:16.180 --> 43:17.472
So it's on us.

43:20.142 --> 43:23.353
No Mars. No parades.

43:23.937 --> 43:26.732
-No Interstellar Exploration Prize.
-We're government employees.

43:26.815 --> 43:29.026
We never would've seen
that prize money anyway.

43:29.109 --> 43:30.986
But there might have been
a handsome plaque.

43:34.072 --> 43:37.618
Hey. We earned the right
to be the first on Mars.

43:38.410 --> 43:40.287
No one can take that away from us.

43:41.038 --> 43:42.873
Now, I know this wasn't our mission,

43:43.874 --> 43:44.875
but it is now.

43:47.002 --> 43:48.629
Maybe the Russians will give us a plaque.

43:52.257 --> 43:55.385
All right. Let's do it.

43:58.305 --> 44:01.058
Sylvie, you and Will initiate
furling of the solar sail.

44:01.141 --> 44:02.142
On it.

44:02.226 --> 44:04.353
Clarke, calculate an intercept burn,
optimized for speed.

44:04.436 --> 44:05.479
Copy that.

44:09.191 --> 44:12.319
-Hop to it, people.
-Aye, aye, Skipper.

44:14.530 --> 44:18.325
Cosmonauts will not like
being rescued by a defector.

44:18.408 --> 44:20.577
Hey, don't worry. I got your back, Rolls.

44:48.355 --> 44:50.232
I didn't want it to go down like this.

44:51.900 --> 44:54.319
If there's anything I can do
to support you, I will.

44:54.987 --> 44:55.988
I'm sorry.

44:56.488 --> 44:58.365
No need to apologize, Ed.

44:58.448 --> 45:02.870
I work for the United States of America.
You work for an asshole.

45:06.373 --> 45:08.584
Once the rescue has been performed,

45:08.667 --> 45:13.338
it will be the first time
since the Apollo-Soyuz mission of 1983

45:13.422 --> 45:16.800
that cosmonauts have been aboard
an American spacecraft.

45:16.884 --> 45:19.720
But reaching the Soviets comes at a cost.

45:19.803 --> 45:23.473
Sojourner will no longer have
enough fuel to land on Mars.

45:23.557 --> 45:27.269
The now-combined crews
will be forced to return home,

45:27.352 --> 45:31.481
leaving Helios's Phoenix
as the sole viable Mars mission.

45:32.858 --> 45:36.820
Mars-94, this is
Commander Danielle Poole of Sojourner.

45:37.362 --> 45:40.449
We are commencing our final approach
for the rescue operation.

45:41.158 --> 45:44.244
Russian crew,
prepare to transfer upon my order

45:44.328 --> 45:46.205
and only my order.

45:47.581 --> 45:48.874
Seems like a pleasant guy.

45:48.957 --> 45:50.209
Yeah.

45:50.292 --> 45:51.585
Closure rate?

45:51.668 --> 45:55.506
We're at .5 meters per second.
We may wanna bump that up,

45:55.589 --> 45:57.966
get them out of that radiation
as soon as we can.

45:58.050 --> 45:59.051
Negative.

45:59.134 --> 46:01.887
We're gonna cut it back in half
for the final approach.

46:02.763 --> 46:05.933
We have to be careful.
These ships weren't designed to dock,

46:06.016 --> 46:08.185
and we've never done
anything like this before.

46:08.268 --> 46:09.520
Roger that, Skipper.

46:09.603 --> 46:12.814
Now, you better suit up.
Just got word from Houston

46:12.898 --> 46:16.485
that the Russian engines
might use liquid hydrogen, just like us.

46:16.568 --> 46:19.821
If we could get access to their fuel,
we could still make it to Mars.

46:19.905 --> 46:21.490
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

46:21.573 --> 46:24.535
You just get some video
of their LH2 valves.

46:24.618 --> 46:27.996
Maybe Houston can find a way
to get the gas from their ship to ours.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.248
Happily.

46:33.293 --> 46:36.421
We're now in position,
and I'm in contact with the Soviet crew.

46:37.256 --> 46:41.510
They assure me their radiation exposure
has been minimal and they're still mobile.

46:42.636 --> 46:45.556
This transmission delay is killing us.
How long is it now?

46:46.890 --> 46:48.892
Five minutes, 29 seconds each way.

46:48.976 --> 46:52.479
That makes us virtually useless to them.

47:02.739 --> 47:05.534
First cosmonauts are hooked up
to the tether and heading across.

47:06.410 --> 47:07.828
Stay frosty, everybody.

47:09.746 --> 47:12.207
Moving along tether, but slow.

47:12.291 --> 47:13.917
We read you, Commander.

47:14.001 --> 47:16.003
Clarke, how's our separation from Mars-94?

47:16.837 --> 47:18.755
The vector is holding steady.

47:20.757 --> 47:25.304
I've got eyes on the LH2 valve.
Begin video transmission to Houston.

47:27.014 --> 47:28.932
Roger, Syl.

47:29.016 --> 47:30.475
Beginning downlink.

47:31.518 --> 47:32.519
Picture looks good.

47:33.770 --> 47:36.940
First cosmonaut
in the air lock. Four to go.

47:52.414 --> 47:54.583
Welcome aboard, Dimitri.

47:54.666 --> 47:56.627
Dog of a defector.

47:56.710 --> 47:58.962
Two down, three to go.

48:14.436 --> 48:16.772
Taking video
of the aft propulsion section.

48:16.855 --> 48:19.066
Continuing downlink to Houston.

48:38.001 --> 48:39.169
Holy shit.

48:40.420 --> 48:41.421
What do you see?

48:41.505 --> 48:44.424
Engine four, tie-tube exit temperature
on the Russian ship.

48:47.427 --> 48:49.179
If their nuclear engines are
anything like ours--

48:49.263 --> 48:51.765
That heat'll transfer
to the liquid hydrogen tank,

48:51.849 --> 48:52.975
overpressure it--

48:53.058 --> 48:54.476
It could bust that system open
at the seams.

48:56.228 --> 48:57.354
That could take out both ships.

48:59.231 --> 49:00.941
Sojourner, Houston.

49:01.024 --> 49:03.068
Immediately terminate
all rescue operations

49:03.151 --> 49:05.112
and maneuver away from the Russian ship.

49:06.738 --> 49:09.992
FIDO, I need a burn that'll separate
those ships by 5 kilometers.

49:10.075 --> 49:11.285
And I need it now.

49:11.368 --> 49:13.036
Roger, Flight. On it.

49:13.620 --> 49:16.540
They won't even get the warning
for another five minutes.

49:20.335 --> 49:21.587
Fuck.

49:22.671 --> 49:23.797
They're on their own.

49:25.757 --> 49:27.926
Four down, one to go.

49:28.468 --> 49:32.472
Rotation control difficult.
Major problems.

49:59.499 --> 50:02.169
Commander, we're losing separation!

50:02.252 --> 50:03.295
Shit.

50:08.383 --> 50:10.969
Everybody clear the port side. Do it now!

50:11.970 --> 50:13.805
All hands, brace for collision.

50:31.657 --> 50:35.786
All hands, clear to starboard.
Clear! Clear! Clear!
