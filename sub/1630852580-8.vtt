WEBVTT

00:14.814 --> 00:16.716
Ah! Yes!

00:25.058 --> 00:26.726
Smile!

00:26.826 --> 00:28.395
PJ:
They were the last people

00:28.495 --> 00:29.896
I was expecting
to come through the door,

00:29.996 --> 00:32.565
and I just -- I'm in shock.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.736
I feel like I haven't
seen you forever!

00:36.836 --> 00:38.838
I saw Myles, and I felt like
I hadn't seen him

00:38.905 --> 00:40.407
in a million years.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.575
I wanted to cry,
and he embraced me,

00:42.675 --> 00:45.045
and actually,
he wouldn't let go.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.546
It just --
It was just amazing.

00:46.613 --> 00:47.881
- This is wild.
- Look at this!

00:47.947 --> 00:49.082
What is this?

00:49.182 --> 00:50.417
Trish:
And there's all these monitors.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.951
Like, you see inside
of our house,

00:52.052 --> 00:53.119
so I'm freaking out.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.354
- Oh, my God!
- Look at this.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.022
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

00:56.089 --> 00:57.924
You've been -- oh, you've been
watching us the whole time?

00:58.024 --> 00:59.092
- The whole time.
- Yeah.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.527
Whitney:
We've watched everything.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.598
- Hey, you see these?
- Oh, you've been watching us?

01:05.698 --> 01:07.634
Yeah, we spy on you guys
all the time.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.069
That is so funny.

01:09.135 --> 01:10.537
Ohhhh!

01:10.603 --> 01:13.440
So you guys really have been
on top of everything.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.208
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:15.275 --> 01:16.609
- How you doing, man?
- Nice to meet you, man.

01:16.709 --> 01:17.777
You, too.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.913
Super nice
to meet your mom, too.

01:19.979 --> 01:25.118
I'm thinking,
have they seen<i> everything?</i>

01:25.218 --> 01:28.988
All right, so as you all see,
these screens --

01:29.089 --> 01:30.590
clearly we've been
watching you.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.392
We also have things
called Meddles,

01:32.459 --> 01:35.728
so we kind of mess around
with the dates a little bit.

01:35.795 --> 01:37.297
What?!

01:37.397 --> 01:40.100
So, yeah, so all of your guys'
dating consultants

01:40.166 --> 01:41.267
are your kids.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.636
- Whoo!
- Oh!

01:43.736 --> 01:45.171
We got sabotaged.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.775
And in order to meddle,
we have to make sacrifices.

01:48.842 --> 01:52.779
Whitney:<i> "But in order for your</i>
<i>players to play the game..."</i>

01:52.846 --> 01:55.315
<i>- Myles!</i>
<i>- Myles!</i>

01:55.415 --> 01:58.318
<i>"...must sacrifice</i>
<i>five pairs of shoes!"</i>

02:02.355 --> 02:04.524
<i>- Looks delish.</i>
<i>- Ew!</i>

02:04.624 --> 02:06.192
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- Ew!</i>

02:10.497 --> 02:13.366
<i>- Miles!</i>
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

02:15.034 --> 02:16.636
<i>They're gonna go out.</i>
<i>We gotta keep the lights on.</i>

02:16.703 --> 02:19.439
...kinda reminded me...

02:19.506 --> 02:23.443
So<i> that's</i> what's been going on.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.879
<i>- Massage each other.</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:28.815
<i>My mom is like,</i>
<i>"What the hell?"</i>

02:28.882 --> 02:31.017
You know, God sent me here
to find my -- my man,

02:31.117 --> 02:33.686
and all these odd things
are happening.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.025
- Oh!
- So awkward.

02:39.125 --> 02:43.530
<i>"What's the sexiest gift</i>
<i>you've ever received?"</i>

02:43.630 --> 02:45.031
<i>Probably a cock ring.</i>

02:45.131 --> 02:47.233
Whoa! Okay!

02:50.003 --> 02:51.571
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>that we're meddling</i>

02:51.671 --> 02:53.373
<i>in their dates and their love.</i>

02:53.473 --> 02:55.875
<i>Okay. Do we want them</i>
<i>to fall into the water today?</i>

02:55.975 --> 02:57.210
<i>I think yeah.</i>

02:57.310 --> 02:59.145
<i>Philip! Philip!</i>

02:59.212 --> 03:00.547
<i>Whoa!</i>

03:03.082 --> 03:04.884
<i>It's warm.</i>
<i>That felt good.</i>

03:04.984 --> 03:07.320
It's cool to see Holy Water
in the flesh, though.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.989
Holy Water.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.224
Holy Water.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.159
Philip was looking like
Black Moses out there.

03:16.229 --> 03:20.033
I am put at ease knowing that
the children are involved,

03:20.099 --> 03:23.770
even though they've done
some really weird things --

03:23.870 --> 03:26.673
the sprinklers, the ballerina,

03:26.739 --> 03:28.408
oh, the harpist.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.211
But above that,
Destiny had a hand

03:31.277 --> 03:34.280
in supporting me
with connecting with Grant.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.083
They said we had to do
some sentiment stones.

03:37.183 --> 03:39.419
Like, we could pick a word
that we think

03:39.519 --> 03:42.088
would help our parents,
like, through their journey.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.756
Destiny:
I chose "Breathe."

03:43.856 --> 03:45.625
I could sense, like,
when she was on a date

03:45.725 --> 03:47.594
with Philip
a couple of times,

03:47.694 --> 03:50.196
there was, like, this energy
like, nervous --

03:50.263 --> 03:51.264
I don't know.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.566
And I was like,
"Bro, relax."

03:53.633 --> 03:56.703
- MJ?
- Uh...

03:56.769 --> 04:00.640
Yeah, I picked "Caution"
just 'cause, you know,

04:00.740 --> 04:02.242
I just -- sometimes
I know my mom

04:02.308 --> 04:05.044
can get into things
a little too quick sometimes.

04:05.111 --> 04:07.981
Oh.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.215
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what I mean?

04:09.282 --> 04:10.817
- That's good advice.
- Yeah.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.652
He doesn't want you
as a stepsister.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.120
Yeah, no.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.424
He's not ready.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.093
Grant:
Nice deflection there.

04:20.159 --> 04:22.495
I feel like this experience
kind of humanized our parents,

04:22.595 --> 04:25.098
like, being able
to see all vulnerable.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.466
- Aw!
- 1,000%.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.401
We learned so much,
and we see you

04:28.468 --> 04:33.106
in a totally different light,
so it was pretty cool, yeah.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.508
I guess I'm a little nervous
about Myles.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.677
It seems he's been struggling
a little bit

04:37.777 --> 04:40.580
with the relationship I've been
developing with his mom.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.181
But today I would love to hear

04:42.282 --> 04:45.285
that both our children
give us their blessing.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.687
Everyone grab a drink.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.856
Oh, here we go.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.758
- Sadly.

04:51.824 --> 04:55.662
Why don't we take this party
back to our retreat?

04:55.762 --> 04:57.830
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

05:03.102 --> 05:05.505
Love is always young
if you want it

05:16.115 --> 05:18.318
- Did you guys see...
- Hey-oh!

05:21.387 --> 05:24.023
The retreat house --
in person, it's unbelievable.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.996
This is awesome, though.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.700
The pool looks
so inviting today.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.868
Yeah.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.171
What's that?

05:38.237 --> 05:39.972
Mmm!

05:40.039 --> 05:41.240
Look at the happy couple.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.375
- Hey!
- Hey, Yvonne.

05:42.475 --> 05:43.676
- Hello.
- How are you?

05:43.743 --> 05:45.378
Oh, come on,
yellow and orange.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.879
- Yeah.
- Listen all the time.

05:46.979 --> 05:49.382
Listen, thigh meat out.
Thighs out, buns out.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.184
You guys look very cozy.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.318
- We are.
- Yeah.

05:52.385 --> 05:53.920
I like this for you.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.522
I-I like this
for both of you.

05:56.589 --> 05:59.258
When you first came
into the retreat, is this --

05:59.359 --> 06:01.828
was he the one you thought
you had your eye on.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.930
That's a good one.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.431
No.
He was my third choice.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.900
- He was your third choice.
- Out of four.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.437
Hey, but third time's
the charm.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.739
- Listen, come on.
- Yeah.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.574
Okay, and was she
your first choice?

06:14.674 --> 06:15.875
She absolutely was.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.043
- Really?
- Hell yeah.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.245
Did you know?
Did you tell her?

06:19.345 --> 06:21.581
I didn't know initially.
No.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.516
You know,
I'm pretty laid back, so...

06:23.583 --> 06:24.917
Yeah, you were observing.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.519
...she caught my eye
the second I walked in here,

06:26.586 --> 06:29.222
and, you know,
just see how things play out,

06:29.288 --> 06:30.790
get to know her.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.259
Really, I only cared about
getting to know her, but...

06:33.359 --> 06:36.028
Oh, come on.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.930
I like this so much.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.599
Well, as you know,
during your time

06:39.699 --> 06:41.601
at the Second Chance Retreat,
you guys were

06:41.701 --> 06:43.269
one of the fortunate couples

06:43.369 --> 06:46.105
to kind of make
a love connection.

06:46.205 --> 06:47.607
Yes.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.942
How do you think
Alex and Myles

06:50.042 --> 06:51.644
will feel
about this connection?

06:51.744 --> 06:54.714
I think Alexandra
will be supportive.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.649
I'm sure she sees
how happy I am

06:56.749 --> 06:58.551
and how comfortable I am
with Deneia,

06:58.618 --> 07:00.887
and I'm sure
she'll give her blessing.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.755
And what about Myles?

07:02.822 --> 07:04.323
He's been<i> very</i> protective
of you.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.093
Well, yep.
And so I'm not sure.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.328
Not sure if
he'll be happy, upset.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.297
I don't think --
I-I don't know, really.

07:11.397 --> 07:12.398
I'm not sure.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.666
- I do.
- Absolutely.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.501
He obviously loves
and cares for his mom,

07:15.601 --> 07:18.237
and it would be really difficult
to proceed,

07:18.304 --> 07:21.407
you know,
if he wasn't on board.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.810
Well, tonight
is a big night.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.678
Okay.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.948
if your daughter, Alex,
and your son, Myles,

07:29.015 --> 07:32.685
will give you
their blessing.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.321
You will be able to make
your decision at a dinner

07:35.421 --> 07:37.490
outside of
the Second Chance Retreat.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.092
I can get my heart crushed
at a nice restaurant.

07:41.494 --> 07:44.330
I wish you guys
nothing but the best.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.666
I'm holding on to hope
for that.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.847
Oh, how do you feel?

08:00.947 --> 08:02.482
I feel so good.
How do you feel?

08:02.548 --> 08:05.952
I've connected with so many
people here, great friends.

08:06.018 --> 08:08.020
I believe that
this will be a bond

08:08.120 --> 08:10.156
that we can take home
for us forever.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.793
My mom's not really making a
romantic connection with anyone.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.529
And it truly does have me
worried 'cause I want her

08:16.629 --> 08:17.964
to find love in this house.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.699
You know, at first
I was saying Troy

08:19.799 --> 08:21.501
and, you know, and Scott.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.036
I ended up at the end,
like, really wanting

08:24.136 --> 08:25.705
to get to know Philip more.

08:25.805 --> 08:26.806
Do you think
he even knows?

08:26.873 --> 08:28.241
I don't think he knows.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.343
You do realize, like, time's
a little bit running out.

08:30.409 --> 08:31.844
Like, today
would be the day.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.412
Today's the only day to tell him
before he leaves.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.580
- Are you gonna do it today?
- Yeah.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.315
Yeah! Okay, Mama!

08:36.382 --> 08:37.383
Okay!

08:37.483 --> 08:39.085
I'm braver now.
I'm a new woman.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.522
I'm opening up, and I'm gonna
do things I normally don't do.

08:42.588 --> 08:45.024
I'm proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.829
Who did you connect
with first right off the bat?

08:49.896 --> 08:52.732
Philip, right?
And he's -- he's a fox as well.

08:52.832 --> 08:55.701
So foxy! I mean, that's who
I chose for you, so, nice.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.236
- Really?
- Yes.

08:57.336 --> 09:00.172
Oh, when you saw us on our date,
though, what did you think?

09:03.075 --> 09:05.378
But then when Carlie's dad,
Grant, came in, I was like,

09:05.444 --> 09:07.713
"Wait, this could be
a<i> thing."</i>

09:07.780 --> 09:09.248
What was going on
with that?

09:09.348 --> 09:12.118
We have a lot in common,
from music --

09:12.218 --> 09:14.620
really, a lot, a lot of music,
but what I really enjoy

09:14.720 --> 09:17.924
is his level of energy and fun
and joy that he brings.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.092
It matches.

09:20.192 --> 09:22.128
Oh, my goodness, Mom.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.263
And I don't know
if anything will come from,

09:24.363 --> 09:27.033
but it's just so refreshing,
and I'm open to exploring,

09:27.099 --> 09:30.536
but it's just
so refreshing to know that

09:30.603 --> 09:32.772
and being yourself,
to be accepted in that way,

09:32.872 --> 09:35.441
and that you can actually
attract likeness.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.410
See, that's what
I came here for.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.812
And I think that that's
the most dynamic part about it

09:39.912 --> 09:41.781
is that...

09:43.883 --> 09:46.752
...what can...

09:46.819 --> 09:49.155
...what can happen...

09:49.255 --> 09:51.157
...when I'm myself.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.159
Yes.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.127
I have definitely learned

09:55.227 --> 09:57.964
that I do not need
to change anything for a man.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.600
Often, when I was
in relationships,

10:00.666 --> 10:03.135
the tendency was for me
to shrink myself.

10:03.235 --> 10:06.072
Those days are over.
My heart is so open.

10:06.138 --> 10:08.741
I am so ready.
I'm excited.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.743
I love you.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.311
Aah!

10:12.411 --> 10:13.346
Going down!

10:13.446 --> 10:15.615
Mom, stop!

10:15.681 --> 10:17.917
What about Kiki
caught your attention?

10:17.984 --> 10:19.652
Just -- there's
a spirit about her.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.187
Yeah.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.489
there's, like,
extra boost of life.

10:23.589 --> 10:27.159
The relationship that Kiki and I
have started out at this point

10:27.259 --> 10:28.594
is fantastic.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.830
So where do you see that
going in the future?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.765
I think the possibilities
are endless with it.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.266
- Yeah.
- I mean, it could go anywhere.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.269
To not risk anything is,
to me, a complete --

10:37.336 --> 10:39.639
you might still be sitting
in a prison cell somewhere,

10:39.705 --> 10:41.207
because it's like,
risk is part of life.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.975
- Yeah.
- Just taking chances.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.810
Mm-hmm.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.212
to really
just open it up.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.780
Hey, man, I'm an open book.

10:47.847 --> 10:49.181
Yeah.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.385
So much to talk about.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.987
Yeah, that's for sure.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.790
Where would you
like to start?

10:57.857 --> 11:00.192
I know you got questions.
Don't be shy.

11:00.292 --> 11:03.029
Um, okay.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.530
When did you start, like,

11:04.630 --> 11:06.465
actually being serious
about Deneia?

11:06.532 --> 11:08.334
Because, obviously, a lot
of people took their time,

11:08.401 --> 11:09.869
got to know
a lot of people.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.571
You both
went on other dates.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.374
For me, when I first
walked through this door

11:15.474 --> 11:16.809
and saw her sitting there,

11:16.876 --> 11:18.744
I knew she was the one
I was gonna focus on.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.912
Hey, Myles!

11:20.012 --> 11:21.747
Hey.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.015
How you doing?

11:23.082 --> 11:25.217
I'm good.
How are you?

11:25.317 --> 11:26.552
I'm good.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.688
I am nervous
about where Myles is.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.057
Myles has never
really seen me date.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.892
Do you want to know
how I feel?

11:32.992 --> 11:34.894
Of course.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.096
Well, I do like Scott,
but, like,

11:37.196 --> 11:39.732
I just feel like
he wouldn't be the best.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.367
You don't think
he's a good fit?

11:41.434 --> 11:43.436
Not for you, no.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.540
My heart just dropped
in my stomach,

11:47.606 --> 11:51.410
because, you know,
I want him to be for us,

11:51.510 --> 11:54.246
and I want him
to want this thing to work.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.549
He's a jokester.
He likes to joke a lot.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.751
Well, that's what I like,
'cause I'm a jokester.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.553
Yeah, but not
all the time...

12:00.619 --> 12:04.557
'cause you get annoyed with me,
and I joke all the time.

12:04.623 --> 12:07.126
But, yes,
but I think that

12:07.226 --> 12:10.529
his heart supersedes
the jokes.

12:10.596 --> 12:15.735
But still, I don't think he's...
the best fit for you.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.937
I've heard talks
about moving and --

12:18.037 --> 12:20.539
No! I didn't say
that I was moving there.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.041
That's what Scott said.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.275
Oh, well, you know...

12:23.375 --> 12:24.610
And you agreed.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.113
We're saying if it worked out,
would I move?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.781
They asked us, would I move,
would he move --

12:28.881 --> 12:30.783
He said in a year
to<i> two</i> years.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.284
That's mad quick.

12:32.384 --> 12:36.555
Two years is not mad quick
for a 44- and a 50-year-old.

12:36.622 --> 12:37.957
Scott:
From your perspective,

12:38.057 --> 12:39.458
what is her son's take
on this all?

12:39.558 --> 12:41.293
Obviously,
that's very important.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.929
He wasn't comfortable
with it at all.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.799
And he had his eye set
on Philip.

12:46.899 --> 12:50.970
Just who he envisioned
wasn't you.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.272
We both are gonna
move slow.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.940
I don't think we're
leaving out of here

12:55.007 --> 12:57.476
going to get married
or doing anything like that.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.418
- Hey.
- Hi!

13:06.485 --> 13:08.454
Hello.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.856
I was gonna ask you, do
you want to go outside
with me really quick?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.658
Yeah.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.326
- Let's do it.
- BRB, you guys.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.662
All right, all right.

13:16.762 --> 13:18.130
Oh.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.333
So out of this experience,
for you, what do you think?

13:21.433 --> 13:24.436
You know, we've made
some lifelong connections...

13:24.503 --> 13:28.440
...that we can cherish
and build on

13:28.507 --> 13:31.010
and really appreciate
going forward, right?

13:31.110 --> 13:32.778
Where we've been, yeah.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.515
I feel like 16 again.

13:36.615 --> 13:39.385
I think this is
the part where, you know,

13:39.485 --> 13:42.855
I just -- I had to tell you
that with you, for some reason,

13:42.955 --> 13:45.691
I have been
more attracted to you.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.194
I didn't show it as much.

13:48.294 --> 13:52.031
I see a, like,
tremendous man.

13:52.131 --> 13:56.168
I want to connect outside
more out of this home.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.670
I have learned

13:57.736 --> 13:59.505
in this retreat is to --

13:59.572 --> 14:02.341
you can't let
day-by-day go

14:02.408 --> 14:04.577
without telling people
how you feel.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.880
So this is my first step,
leaving the house

14:07.980 --> 14:09.982
and saying this is
how I felt about you,

14:10.049 --> 14:13.152
and I should have maybe
came at you a little different.

14:13.219 --> 14:16.222
But I would like to carry on
that friendship that me and you,

14:16.322 --> 14:17.923
I feel bonded...

14:18.023 --> 14:21.193
...a little bit more for me
than the other men...

14:21.260 --> 14:24.163
...to get to know you more
outside of this.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.732
You know, we can start
just doing what we do,

14:26.832 --> 14:28.234
'cause we've been doing it.

14:28.334 --> 14:29.702
I think with Philip,

14:29.768 --> 14:31.704
he is the man of my choice.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.740
And now finding a man
that I know is good-looking

14:34.840 --> 14:38.077
from the outside to the end,
very family-oriented,

14:38.177 --> 14:40.346
I found exactly
what I'm looking for.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.448
I mean, that's a beautiful
thing, right?

14:42.548 --> 14:46.552
I mean, you're so enjoyable
to be around, right?

14:46.619 --> 14:49.521
And we've had
so much fun here.

14:49.588 --> 14:52.691
- We have.
- Right? I mean, you know?

14:52.758 --> 14:54.593
Even if it's just like,
"Nah, Trish, just friends,"

14:54.693 --> 14:56.228
it won't hurt her feelings.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.930
What my mom has taught
me from this experience

14:58.030 --> 14:59.732
is to never give up
on finding love

14:59.798 --> 15:02.868
and sometimes take chances
that you would never do.

15:02.935 --> 15:06.105
I've never been so proud of her.

15:06.205 --> 15:10.576
Well, you know, I haven't made
the romantic connection.

15:10.643 --> 15:14.446
Every time we just -- we talk,
you get sweeter and sweeter.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.048
Yeah.
Thank you for that.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.783
And I'm so thankful that I've
had a chance to meet you here.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.785
Yeah, absolutely.
Me too.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.488
I don't have
a romantic interest in Trish,

15:22.588 --> 15:24.957
but there are so many things
about Trish

15:25.057 --> 15:29.128
that I respect,
love, appreciate.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.063
I don't want to lead her on
in any way,

15:31.130 --> 15:33.599
but I do want her to know
that she is

15:33.666 --> 15:36.135
that wonderful,
beautiful, special woman.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.736
This is just the first start

15:37.803 --> 15:40.673
of the new Trish,
so I got to start somewhere.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.976
So it just happened to be
the most amazing man I've met.

15:44.076 --> 15:47.746
So I wouldn't wanted any other
man to tell that to, so...

15:47.813 --> 15:49.315
I've learned that

15:49.415 --> 15:52.184
I'm a little bit more shy
than I thought.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.486
I've learned that life is short,

15:54.586 --> 15:56.255
to go get what you want.

15:56.322 --> 15:57.489
I've learned a lot.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.158
Look at me.
I'm getting brave.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.433
Whoo-hoo!
Good job.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.134
I don't know what to say.

16:09.201 --> 16:10.169
Yeah.

16:10.269 --> 16:11.670
Maybe he'll come around.

16:11.770 --> 16:14.506
I love seeing my dad happy
and Deneia happy.

16:14.606 --> 16:17.876
They are both amazing people
and they deserve this.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.778
I'm still crazy about you.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.849
Like, I know what
my mom told me.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.884
You think she was
being genuine?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.787
Like, of course
she's like...

16:28.854 --> 16:31.724
I do know my dad

16:31.824 --> 16:34.793
is so serious
about your mom.

16:34.860 --> 16:39.398
It's annoying me that Alex
is trying to push it on me,

16:39.498 --> 16:40.632
but I understand why,

16:40.699 --> 16:42.501
because she wants
the best for her father.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.970
You know, if she feels like
he deserves a chance,

16:45.037 --> 16:47.706
then, you know, I still...

16:47.806 --> 16:50.676
still got a lot to think about.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.852
- Oh, look! Look!
- What?

16:59.918 --> 17:02.154
- "Love is in the air."
- "Love is in the air."

17:03.589 --> 17:05.057
- So cute.
- "Love is in the air."

17:05.157 --> 17:07.860
- We love love! We love love.
- We love love.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.561
We love love!
We love the love.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.497
- Thank you.
- Cheers to that.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.573
I mean, after all,
we're like 49, 50 years old

17:21.673 --> 17:24.009
and already talking about
our golden...

17:24.076 --> 17:26.912
Yeah.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.914
- That didn't quite turn out.
- ...that didn't quite turn out.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.216
I was way cooler
than I am now.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.384
I still got my cool card.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.619
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.254
You know,
I'm always cool.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.589
You are very cool.
Yeah.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.892
I am until, like, this thing
gives out when I take a step

17:39.958 --> 17:42.628
and it's just like...

17:42.728 --> 17:44.263
That's good.
That's important.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.365
- Hey, Nicole. How are you?
- How are you?

17:46.432 --> 17:47.699
I'm good.
How are both of you?

17:47.766 --> 17:49.301
- Good.
- Better now that I see you.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.537
Oh, why, thank you.
I'm feeling the same.

17:51.603 --> 17:52.938
This is...

17:53.038 --> 17:54.940
Thank you.
Ooh, a card.

17:55.040 --> 17:55.974
- Bye!
- Thanks, Nicole.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.276
Kiki's got a card.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.945
I love this.
Sometimes a card says "Kiki."

18:00.045 --> 18:02.081
But now it says,
"Grant and Kiki."

18:02.147 --> 18:03.449
- No way.
- Mm!

18:03.549 --> 18:04.817
- Uh-oh.
- Okay.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.485
"During your time
in the Second Chance Retreat,

18:06.585 --> 18:09.288
you have formed
a close romantic connection.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.458
Tonight, you will discover
if Carlie and Destiny

18:12.558 --> 18:15.994
give their blessings
for you to stay together."

18:16.095 --> 18:19.064
That's kind of
a heavy card.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.101
Okay.

18:49.161 --> 18:51.163
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you doing?

18:51.263 --> 18:52.464
- Fine.
- Good to see you.

18:52.531 --> 18:53.999
Good to see you.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.137
Isn't this nice?

18:58.203 --> 18:59.671
It's beautiful.
It's really beautiful.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.940
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, sweetie!

19:02.007 --> 19:04.143
- Hello!
- Hi.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.277
There you go.

19:05.344 --> 19:06.845
- You look great.
- Thank you.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.380
- You look beautiful yourself.
- Thank you.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.616
- You look pretty, Mom.
- Thank you, sweets.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.684
You look beautiful.
Good to see you.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.052
You look nice.
We're matching.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.121
- Yeah, we're matching.
- And we are.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.623
- Cross match, yeah.
- Exactly.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.559
It's a cross thing. We got
a cross match going here.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.694
How are you two doing?

19:22.794 --> 19:24.897
I mean, I-I think so, yeah.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.533
This anxiety moment, right?
You know, sitting here

19:27.633 --> 19:29.034
and, like, with all this
beautiful stuff,

19:29.134 --> 19:30.235
but we're still
sort of nervous.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.570
It's a lot to take in.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.705
And I just think about,
like, logistically.

19:33.805 --> 19:37.843
Carlie:
It's a big transition 'cause
here you're together 24/7.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.379
You have nothing but time
to get to know each other.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.382
Versus when you leave,
it's Texas, New York,

19:43.482 --> 19:45.050
and you're gonna have to
make some adjustments.

19:45.150 --> 19:48.153
But, like, I feel like you have
such a strong bond.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.022
It's been so fun to watch.

19:50.088 --> 19:52.224
A little cringey sometimes,
but, like...

19:52.324 --> 19:55.327
Kiki, every time
you walk into a room,

19:55.394 --> 19:57.162
you just brighten it up.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.931
Oh, my God.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.038
You guys are killing me.

20:07.506 --> 20:10.075
I couldn't ask for anyone better
for my dad.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.378
You have my blessing.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.916
Grant, you seem like
a lovely man

20:18.016 --> 20:19.751
and kind soul
and sweetheart

20:19.851 --> 20:22.054
and just, like,
a big old teddy bear.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.424
I feel like you are the man
that I, you know --

20:25.524 --> 20:28.193
I can see her really building
something with,

20:28.260 --> 20:31.230
and I --
I give my blessing.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.799
And I love you.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.435
Goodness gracious.
Ooh, you're sweaty.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.439
All right.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.046
That was very sweet.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.815
Oh, Carlie.

20:51.283 --> 20:56.288
Time and distance
is a consideration.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.790
I've kind of jumped before

20:58.890 --> 21:01.827
when everything seemed
so very perfect,

21:01.927 --> 21:04.763
been through
many challenges.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.568
And so I am willing
to jump now.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.237
It feels right.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.951
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.486
Y'all are like
two little guppies.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.755
- I came here to close the deal.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.790
There's something just beautiful
about the collective

21:31.857 --> 21:35.827
because I feel like we're all
invested at this point.

21:35.927 --> 21:38.664
And that's just --
that just feels wonderful.

21:38.764 --> 21:41.166
I want to toast
to second chances,

21:41.266 --> 21:43.168
and to risking,

21:43.268 --> 21:46.004
because there is no rewards
without risks.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.005
That's right.

21:47.105 --> 21:48.940
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

21:51.710 --> 21:53.612
I do want to add
a little cheers to you guys...

21:53.679 --> 21:56.181
Yeah, yeah.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.483
To go through this with you
was amazing.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.687
Oh, we can't,
probably.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.047
Hey, Dad.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.216
Hey, princess.
You look amazing.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.018
Thanks.
So do you.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.690
How are you feeling, Dad?

22:38.757 --> 22:40.258
I'm feeling
a little nervous.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.760
Yeah?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.228
Could be getting
a crushing blow

22:43.328 --> 22:44.763
here this evening,
you know?

22:44.863 --> 22:47.065
Hopefully have a shoulder
to cry on if I need it.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.336
I appreciate that.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.409
You look stunning,
as always.

22:57.509 --> 22:58.910
Thank you.

23:00.846 --> 23:04.182
- Hello. You look so pretty.
- So do you.

23:04.249 --> 23:06.084
Thank you.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.390
What a coincidence.
We were just talking about you.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.925
Really?

23:14.025 --> 23:15.093
How you feeling?

23:15.193 --> 23:16.294
You know, I'm nervous.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.296
Who you telling?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.766
How are you?
How has your day been?

23:20.866 --> 23:22.901
A lot of emotions.

23:22.968 --> 23:24.603
I don't know
how to feel right now.

23:24.703 --> 23:25.637
It's been a day.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.139
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.875
So have you talked to Myles,
or have you seen him?

23:29.941 --> 23:32.744
Not much. I have no idea
where he is right now.

23:32.811 --> 23:36.782
Did he say anything to you about
how he was feeling or anything?

23:36.882 --> 23:38.150
Not today.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.619
He's always been one of
my biggest supporters,

23:40.719 --> 23:42.154
but this is a new situation.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.791
I'm not even sure
if he would support me here

23:45.891 --> 23:48.794
because he's never
really seen me date.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.128
But hopefully he comes.

23:50.228 --> 23:52.898
In my mind, I'm thinking
it's about to go down.

23:52.964 --> 23:57.269
Myles is going to cut this
thing off right at the head.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.578
- There is.
- Myles!

24:06.645 --> 24:09.414
- Hi, buddy.
- Glad you could join us.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.651
We missed you.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.419
Hey, Ma.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.856
I'm so glad
that you're here!

24:17.956 --> 24:19.491
Me, too.

24:19.591 --> 24:22.327
- Are you?
- Yeah.

24:22.427 --> 24:24.529
- Oh.
- Look at that view.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.766
- I know.
- If you just ignore our parents.

24:30.869 --> 24:33.672
I was worried for a second.
I didn't think you were coming.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.107
Just running
a little bit late.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.943
If Myles doesn't give
his blessing,

24:38.009 --> 24:39.344
I'm gonna be crushed.

24:39.444 --> 24:42.848
I'm not sure how we would
be able to proceed.

24:47.118 --> 24:49.187
Myles, I care about your mom
deeply.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.989
I think you're
an outstanding young man,

24:51.056 --> 24:53.959
and if you didn't support us,
you know, trying to be together,

24:54.025 --> 24:57.329
that would be -- that would be
really tough to overcome.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.335
I have never
seen you so happy,

25:03.401 --> 25:08.373
and Deneia, you're an amazing,
beautiful, strong woman.

25:08.473 --> 25:11.543
Thank you.

25:11.643 --> 25:12.811
full-heartedly.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.347
Thank you, princess.

25:15.413 --> 25:18.884
I think my dad and Deneia
have such a good connection,

25:18.984 --> 25:23.054
and she is everything he's
always imagined in a partner.

25:23.154 --> 25:26.224
She has really brought out
his softer side,

25:26.324 --> 25:28.860
and he's been
so much more vulnerable

25:28.927 --> 25:31.096
and really opened up
about his feelings.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.564
They could really fall in love,

25:32.664 --> 25:35.534
and they could have
an amazing relationship.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.669
Why wouldn't I support it?

25:37.736 --> 25:40.071
Well...

25:40.171 --> 25:42.874
you know,
it's been a tough journey.

25:44.276 --> 25:49.047
You know, me thinking,
how I've been thinking,

25:49.114 --> 25:51.049
being protective of you,

25:51.116 --> 25:55.053
I'm hearing the fears,
so, you know, it's tough.

25:57.188 --> 26:00.525
And, you know,
I definitely --

26:00.592 --> 26:02.961
I think you're a great man.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.064
But, um...

26:06.131 --> 26:09.734
I don't -- I do not think
I can give you my blessing.

26:14.472 --> 26:15.807
I'm just playing.

26:17.976 --> 26:19.911
I give you --
I give you my blessing.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.148
Scott's shitting his pants.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.083
A little.
A little bit.

26:26.651 --> 26:28.320
You know, it's been tough
going through this process,

26:28.420 --> 26:31.756
seeing my mom, and trying to,
you know,

26:31.823 --> 26:33.558
scope out
if it's really genuine.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.827
But I want my mom to find love.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.964
And if my mom is willing
to give Scott a chance,

26:39.064 --> 26:41.132
then, you know,
I'll do the same.

26:41.232 --> 26:45.837
I can see that you're willing
to really try with my mom,

26:45.937 --> 26:49.274
which I feel like some guys
haven't really done.

26:49.341 --> 26:53.011
I definitely think
you deserve a chance.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.647
Even though it is hard
to gain my trust,

26:55.747 --> 26:58.583
I definitely do want to
give you my blessing.

26:58.650 --> 27:00.752
I look forward
to gaining your trust

27:00.819 --> 27:02.787
and your mom's as well.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.790
I'm happy for you guys!

27:05.857 --> 27:07.993
I'm so happy, too.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.495
Myles is happy, too!

27:13.264 --> 27:15.433
Aw! Oh.

27:17.869 --> 27:19.671
Thank goodness.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.706
I was so worried.

27:21.806 --> 27:26.611
I felt like the weight
on my shoulders was lifted.

27:26.678 --> 27:29.014
I felt like I could take
my bra off and throw it.

27:29.114 --> 27:31.950
I just -- I was just so happy.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.853
I'd like to make a toast.

27:34.953 --> 27:36.688
To second chances.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.356
- Second chances.
- Second chances.

27:38.456 --> 27:40.058
- Whoo!
- Yay!

27:59.644 --> 28:02.814
Oh, that's cool. This is just
fucking broken glass in here.

28:02.881 --> 28:05.316
- Wait, really?
- And a fingernail.

28:05.383 --> 28:08.253
What the hell is going on
in this house?!

28:08.353 --> 28:09.721
It is time to go.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.890
- It is. It is time to bounce.
- It is time to go.

28:11.990 --> 28:15.060
We've really grown
a little family here.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.228
I don't know if I'm ready to go.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.405
- Hey.
- Hey, son. There you are.

28:27.505 --> 28:29.908
- How you feeling?
- Oh, man, I'm feeling great.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.009
- Good.
- I'm feeling great, man.

28:31.076 --> 28:32.277
What an experience.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.845
I feel like
the time I spent here --

28:33.912 --> 28:37.082
it's opened my mind up
to look more deeply

28:37.182 --> 28:40.919
into the character
of that special woman.

28:41.019 --> 28:44.689
So leaving without a romantic
connection is fine for me

28:44.756 --> 28:46.591
because I remain hopeful.

28:46.691 --> 28:49.027
I'll continue to help my dad out
as a dating consultant, yeah.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.096
I'm not giving up.
No, not at all.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.599
- Hey, guys. What's up, Myles?
- Hey.

28:54.699 --> 28:55.934
Scott and I are gonna
take it slow.

28:56.034 --> 28:58.103
We're gonna take
Myles' advice.

28:58.203 --> 29:00.138
He definitely respects Myles
and where he sits,

29:00.238 --> 29:03.041
and he wants to make sure that
Myles is comfortable with him.

29:03.108 --> 29:05.643
She can move to Florida
in four years.

29:07.045 --> 29:08.747
Tell you,
this has been a profound,

29:08.813 --> 29:10.448
life-altering experience.

29:10.548 --> 29:11.716
I'm gonna miss it.

29:11.783 --> 29:13.618
I'm a really good
dating consultant,

29:13.718 --> 29:14.719
I would say.

29:14.786 --> 29:16.488
I'm gonna put it
on my LinkedIn.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.795
- How was it?
- It was awesome.

29:23.895 --> 29:25.296
Yeah?

29:25.396 --> 29:28.633
and so relieved and so --
so much weight off my shoulders.

29:28.733 --> 29:31.636
Having you here has been
the most tremendous experience

29:31.736 --> 29:35.140
of -- one of the most tremendous
experiences of my life.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.809
There may be something
brewing with Joel,

29:37.909 --> 29:40.145
but I just --
we'll just have to see.

29:40.245 --> 29:41.780
I mean, you know...

29:41.846 --> 29:44.115
My advice to you
moving forward

29:44.182 --> 29:47.485
is don't judge a book
by its cover,

29:47.585 --> 29:50.321
'cause you never know
what you might read.

29:50.421 --> 29:52.157
Look at me, just coming up
with the one-liners.

29:52.257 --> 29:53.758
Totally.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.126
Want to get a cocktail?

29:55.193 --> 29:56.628
- Yeah, let's go.
- Okay, cool.

29:56.694 --> 29:59.297
- I want a margarita!
- Or a shot.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.772
Hi!

30:07.839 --> 30:10.175
- Hello.
- Hello.

30:10.275 --> 30:11.309
How you doing?

30:11.376 --> 30:13.311
There we are
leaving with Grant.

30:15.113 --> 30:16.514
So, I mean...

30:16.614 --> 30:19.617
we came to do what we came
to do and it got done.

30:19.684 --> 30:21.686
- I'm so excited to go.
- Let's go.

30:21.786 --> 30:23.521
Yes! Yes! Yes!

30:31.663 --> 30:34.566
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, hey, hey.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.501
- Oh, my God.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.236
- Oh, my God.
- How are you?

30:38.336 --> 30:41.806
- I'm good.
- Oh, I missed you.

30:41.873 --> 30:43.408
So I've invited Karen
out to meet me.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.476
It'll be the first time
I've seen her since we left

30:45.543 --> 30:46.744
he Second Chance Retreat.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.046
- How are you?
- God, you look beautiful.

30:48.146 --> 30:49.480
Thank you.

30:49.547 --> 30:52.483
I'm just really kind of hoping
to just understand

30:52.550 --> 30:53.751
where her head's at

30:53.852 --> 30:55.253
and hopefully understand
where we're at.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.555
I can't believe this.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.858
I am so happy right now.

30:59.924 --> 31:01.092
God, it's good
to see you.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.594
You, too.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.029
It absolutely has felt like
no time has passed by.

31:05.096 --> 31:08.900
Got little butterflies again
and very happy.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.401
So what have you
been up to?

31:10.501 --> 31:12.670
You know, getting plugged
back into work,

31:12.737 --> 31:14.105
getting Noah
off to college.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.874
Same thing.
Got Breana off to college.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.343
Yep.

31:18.409 --> 31:20.211
Things are back to normal.

31:20.278 --> 31:22.347
Back to normal.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.082
Except for this.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.284
This is normal.
This is absolutely normal.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.586
Yeah.
What are your thoughts

31:28.686 --> 31:29.787
in the time
we haven't seen each other

31:29.888 --> 31:32.523
about things
moving forward?

31:32.590 --> 31:35.293
I mean, I've liked the direction
we've been heading...

31:35.393 --> 31:36.761
...and how we've
kept in contact,

31:36.861 --> 31:39.597
and I obviously want to
continue moving forward.

31:39.697 --> 31:42.233
Yeah, I'm ready to be
in a relationship with you.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.936
In a committed
relationship?

31:45.036 --> 31:47.472
Oh, I absolutely
would love that.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.975
I'm absolutely ecstatic
that I took this chance.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.477
I didn't know what I was
gonna find,

31:52.577 --> 31:54.445
and it's really been
a special journey so far,

31:54.545 --> 31:57.282
and I'm so looking forward
to the future.
