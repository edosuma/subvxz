00:02.040 --> 00:03.599
Previously on Dance Academy...

00:03.600 --> 00:06.079
Welcome to the National
Academy of Dance.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.999
I'm Abigail.
Oh, I'm Tara.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.359
- So you met Kat?
- Good luck.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.839
- Who's that?
- Ethan Karamakov.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.959
You could learn
something by watching Tara.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.839
It was surprisingly good.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.479
An allegation has been made,

00:18.480 --> 00:22.719
and if it's true, we'll have no choice
but to cancel your audition.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.319
Tara bunked in with me last night.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.079
Then I'd like to see the solo

00:26.080 --> 00:29.289
that Miss Raine
has been telling me about.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.119
Go on.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.799
I know you don't think
you're ready, but you are.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.531
I can't take care of you forever.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.921
It's time.

01:50.120 --> 01:54.079
So I got in... to Dance Academy

01:54.080 --> 01:57.879
and life is about
to become spectacular.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.850
The only downside is leaving home.

02:01.840 --> 02:04.359
Mine is pretty special.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.319
There's only 300 people in the town

02:07.320 --> 02:10.399
so every one of us
is known for something.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.439
You might be a footballer
or the fastest shearer or...

02:13.440 --> 02:14.959
Hey, ballerina!

02:14.960 --> 02:17.088
Me.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.919
I've never been the new kid before

02:57.920 --> 03:01.239
and suddenly it's like
the slate has been wiped clean

03:01.240 --> 03:05.559
and I've no longer
got a history, just a future.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.564
Oi!
Sorry. Sorry.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.239
It's official.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.879
From this moment on
I'm living my dream

03:37.880 --> 03:41.239
and I can be whoever I want to be.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.679
You made it!

03:43.680 --> 03:48.079
I was literally doing cartwheels
when I heard they let you in.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.639
I mean, of course you belong here.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.847
So straightaway I got us
assigned as room-mates.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.599
What's wrong?

03:55.600 --> 03:57.439
Did you want to room
with someone else?

03:57.440 --> 04:01.559
No, no. I kind of got a message
from Kat about rooming with her and...

04:01.560 --> 04:03.199
But this is so great.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.279
Better than great.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.599
This is going to be the best year
in history!

04:25.520 --> 04:26.851
Oh, um...

04:28.800 --> 04:32.964
Sorry about that.
Administrative error. Sorry. Sorry.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.479
Next, please.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.959
Yeah.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.999
Last name?
Lieberman.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.119
I've already put you in a room.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.359
Get out of there.
I know, I know.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.399
Do you want to be with someone else?
No, no. It's not that.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.999
Miss Histead, one of the toilets
is clogged.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.239
I don't think the girls
should be flushing their tampons.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.839
Oh, thank you, Bonnie.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.879
Look, this is not a hotel. If I
switch rooms for you, I have to...

04:59.880 --> 05:02.359
I know, I know.
I wouldn't want to put you out.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.199
Someone stole my suitcase, miss.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.159
Look, why don't you do me a favour?

05:06.160 --> 05:07.839
Go back and give them
another chance.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.519
But I don't think...

05:09.520 --> 05:11.443
Now.
..you understand.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.683
You can't see without those, right?

05:36.200 --> 05:38.009
Great.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.047
Oh, no. No, no.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.679
Gotta be kidding.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.119
- I'm not kidding.
- I danced every day of the holidays.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.719
I didn't want to start
the year off stiff.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.399
Besides, it's only
165 days till exams

06:01.400 --> 06:03.399
and I really want to win
the scholarship this year.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.526
Hey, Sophie.

06:09.600 --> 06:13.559
Yeah, so my cousin, his mate,
said he ran into her over New Year's.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.359
Yeah, word is she's got some tattoos
in some very interesting places.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.170
Really? Like what places?

06:20.160 --> 06:23.839
Use your imagination, man,
or is that affected by your eyesight?

06:35.560 --> 06:37.559
Suni is seriously deluded

06:37.560 --> 06:40.404
if she thinks she's taking
my spot at the barre.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.159
Ooh, there's Kat.
I want to go say hi.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.767
I told you. She's anthrax
to your reputation.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.608
Suit yourself.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.359
Hey, Tara-tiara.
Oh, I've missed you.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.239
Hey, what are you doing
talking to Abigail?

07:02.240 --> 07:03.879
I thought after audition week...
Hold it.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.239
I don't know what's with you two,
but it's the first day of a new year

07:07.240 --> 07:09.399
and I just want to be
friends with everyone.

07:09.400 --> 07:13.399
Honey, I want a unicorn, but they
keep telling me it's not possible.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.079
Hey, didn't that hurt?

07:16.080 --> 07:18.401
Uh, surprisingly little.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.759
Welcome to first year.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.159
While most of your friends at home
are being ordinary teenagers,

07:25.160 --> 07:28.759
you all have chosen a different
path, an extraordinary one.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.319
This will be your home
for the next three years.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.199
We will train six days a week,

07:33.200 --> 07:35.599
working harder than many people
work in a lifetime.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.079
This year,

07:37.080 --> 07:39.519
the Academy has decided
to broaden the curriculum

07:39.520 --> 07:44.526
and introduce you to more styles
of dance, not just ballet.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.879
Over the coming days
you'll be assessed in jazz...

08:04.440 --> 08:05.559
contemporary...

08:17.280 --> 08:18.439
character...

08:26.600 --> 08:27.599
and hip-hop.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.839
These results will be posted
at the end of the week.

08:39.840 --> 08:45.210
How you place may as well be
your identity while at the Academy.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.839
I can't believe we get
to do this every day now.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.999
- Get used to it!
- Girls.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.399
Tomorrow I want you
to come into repertoire

09:11.400 --> 09:13.399
knowing the Kitri solo
from 'Don Quixote'.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.959
Yes! I already know that dance.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.282
Samuel, Tara,
please see me before you go.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.559
What do you mean I have to do
pointe? Boys don't do pointe.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.519
They do when their ankles are weak.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.679
But I'll be a laughing stock.
MORE of a one.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.799
A laughing stock
with stronger ankles.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.039
There's always
a silver lining, Samuel.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.530
Now, Tara.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.719
Miss Raine, thanks
for assigning us the Kitri solo.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.799
You won't be taking
repertoire class tomorrow.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.679
We've decided your technique
isn't ready for pointe work.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.839
But I've been en pointe for years.
At my old studio...

09:50.840 --> 09:53.159
At your old studio
they trained you poorly,

09:53.160 --> 09:55.879
so tomorrow,
and until I say otherwise,

09:55.880 --> 09:58.599
you're to go back to basics
and work at the barre.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.239
Miss Raine, please.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.244
It's not up for discussion, Tara.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.439
You know those moments when you
see yourself, like, accidentally,

10:14.440 --> 10:16.719
and go, "That's me!"?

10:16.720 --> 10:20.439
It's not some movie you're watching
or happening to someone else.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.759
This is, like, your life.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.159
Hey, Gloria. The usual.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.919
Gloria, is it? These muffins
are labelled as 97% fat-free.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.759
But were you there
when they were made?

10:32.760 --> 10:34.439
Do you personally know
that saturated fats

10:34.440 --> 10:36.359
weren't accidentally slipped in?

10:36.360 --> 10:38.519
Hey, how was your...

10:42.600 --> 10:44.319
Are you alright?

10:44.320 --> 10:47.369
Chickens on rollerblades?!

10:48.960 --> 10:51.559
It's Orientation Week.
People are crazy, pulling pranks.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.199
I'm Ethan.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.919
Yeah, I know. We met.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.561
Audition week.
Ln the dressing room.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.050
And then the party.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.449
I'm Tara.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.649
Right. Well, hey, enjoy your lunch.

11:20.400 --> 11:24.803
Yeah, that's mine, twinkletoes.
You can put your pointe shoes in there.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.599
'Twinkletoes'.
That's a good call, Sean.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.443
Oi, Samboy.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.439
Hi?

11:36.440 --> 11:38.799
Kat, I told you.
Lt has to be a girl.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.319
Can't you just think
of him as 'Samantha'?

11:41.320 --> 11:44.039
- No. No, don't. Really.
- Sorry.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.599
O Week requirement.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.399
You're going to have
to find someone else.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.879
Oh. Well, we tried.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.609
Yeah.
OK, 'bye.

11:59.320 --> 12:03.279
Oh, adorable.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.280
You didn't tell me you were
Patchewalling's 'best ballerina'.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.570
Three years running.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.449
Why the face?

12:14.440 --> 12:18.879
Alright, so I'm obviously
blowing this way out of proportion,

12:18.880 --> 12:23.880
but Miss Raine's
kind of taken these guys hostage.

12:24.480 --> 12:28.199
She hasn't?! Wow!

12:28.200 --> 12:32.359
I mean, I've heard of them doing that
in the junior school, but not here.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.169
That's really going backwards.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.119
Hey, T, have you got a minute?

12:37.120 --> 12:40.479
I thought we'd go to the Pilates
studio, do some crunches.

12:40.480 --> 12:44.166
Raincheck. I think I'd pass out
if I crunched, anyway.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.799
I don't want to get in trouble
for being out of the dorms.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.519
Relax. It's not even past curfew.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.045
There they are.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.239
You've come. But have you
chosen wisely?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.999
Um, I think so.
Chosen what?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.199
During O Week, there
is one sacred tradition.

13:07.200 --> 13:12.200
Each year, we ask two first-year
girls to display great courage.

13:13.040 --> 13:17.090
We dare you to jump from there...

13:20.160 --> 13:22.679
into there.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.762
Tonight.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.161
Awesome.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.639
Kat, no way.
We could break our necks.

13:40.640 --> 13:45.159
They've measured the water. It's OK.
Look, it happens every year.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.730
Seriously, the water's deep.
We'll be fine.

13:47.720 --> 13:51.279
Well, what do we get for doing it,
and why do we have to be naked?

13:51.280 --> 13:54.759
Infamy. And underwear is not naked.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.570
Stop making excuses
and start stripping.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.367
Wish I'd worn better undies.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.211
Alright, let's get this over with.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.559
Higher than you think, isn't it?

14:14.560 --> 14:16.039
Yeah.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.611
There wouldn't be sharks in this
part of the harbour, would there?

14:19.600 --> 14:24.600
Just 'cause I've got this fear
of sharks... and heights.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.799
You know, Tara,
I'm not feeling so good.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.039
Hey, hey, hey. You're fine.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.159
Just think of it as leaping
into the unknown.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.759
Only don't look down.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.759
We're about to jump down, Tara.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.967
First we get to fly.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.119
Girls, if you're going to jump,
you'd better do it quick.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.359
- Jump! Jump!
- Together on three.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.799
Jump! Jump!

14:47.800 --> 14:50.639
- One.
- Jump! Jump! Jump!

14:50.640 --> 14:51.999
Two.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.331
Tara!

15:10.400 --> 15:13.399
That was so much fun.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.559
OK, let's do it again.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.559
Do you have a desire
to become a quadriplegic?

15:17.560 --> 15:21.639
Um, I guess it'd get me
out of class. I'm joking!

15:21.640 --> 15:23.999
There could've been rocks down there.
You don't know what's under there.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.843
I got pulled off that balcony, OK?

15:33.640 --> 15:37.079
Really? So I have you to thank
for leading my sister astray.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.289
Yeah, that probably
was pretty stupid.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.409
I'm going to have
to keep my eye on you, Tara.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.639
Miss Raine!

15:57.640 --> 16:01.919
Can I take those for you?
Wow, that's a lot of paperwork.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.559
Um, I know you think I'm behind
the other girls here, but...

16:05.560 --> 16:06.919
And you're right.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.719
And I'm not crash-hot in technique
class or contemporary or jazz,

16:09.720 --> 16:11.239
but if you let me show you

16:11.240 --> 16:13.719
what I can do when
I'm really dancing en pointe...

16:13.720 --> 16:16.799
I told you that was not an option.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.639
Tara, if you want to start off
the year on the right foot,

16:19.640 --> 16:22.559
I'd suggest examining
who your friends are.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.479
Girls like Abigail
will keep you focused.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.963
Katrina? You'll be lucky
to make it through the semester.

16:35.200 --> 16:39.039
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
I could really use some advice.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.247
Why don't you ask Kat?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.519
Look, I've tried
to show you the way here.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.199
I know you have.
Please, Abby, Miss Raine hates me.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.202
Tell me what to do.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.639
Trust me. She's written you off
as the worst dancer in the year.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.358
It's up to you to prove she's wrong.

17:04.359 --> 17:09.159
Good morning, ladies. Let me
see what you've been working on.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.560
Groups of four.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.199
What do you think you're doing?

17:37.200 --> 17:39.009
Dancing.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.679
As well as anyone.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.799
If you believe that,
you must be delusional.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.119
But I know...
Your feet were sloppy.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.439
You lost your turnout
and almost dislocated your knee,

17:50.440 --> 17:51.919
not to mention your ankles,

17:51.920 --> 17:53.439
there was a complete
lack of coordination

17:53.440 --> 17:54.919
between your upper body
and your arms...

17:54.920 --> 17:57.599
Shall I continue?
But I was just trying to...

17:57.600 --> 18:02.600
If you're going to stand there and argue
with me or, worse still, cry,

18:03.320 --> 18:05.519
you can get out of my class.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.010
Right now!

18:39.600 --> 18:44.600
She was out of line. I had no idea
she would react like that.

18:44.760 --> 18:48.242
It's not just Miss Raine. It's me.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.482
I don't make sense in this place.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.245
- At home I'm...
- Special?

18:57.720 --> 19:01.479
I'm the dancer.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.999
And here I'm not
even ordinary. I'm worse.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.245
Don't beat yourself up too much.
Not everyone makes it here.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.239
Hey. Hey! Don't even think about it.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.039
What?
I'm a guy, OK?

19:29.040 --> 19:32.239
You can't just come in here
and get undressed in front of me.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.359
Oh, and I'm never
buying you tampons.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.479
That's... that's good to know, Sammy.

19:37.480 --> 19:41.639
In fact, as soon as this
whole room situation's cleared up,

19:41.640 --> 19:44.799
I'm going to be spending more time
with the boys, doing guy stuff.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.282
So you might want to get
yourself some new friends.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.799
OK.

19:52.800 --> 19:57.399
Twinkletoes. So you gonna play
the girl part or the boy part today?

19:57.400 --> 19:59.919
- Where are your pointe shoes?
- He's such a loser.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.079
Hey, Sean. Boys.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.159
Even if Sammy does do the girl part,

20:08.160 --> 20:11.130
he's more man than
all you guys put together.

20:30.160 --> 20:34.039
- Tara's such a sweetie.
- I really do feel for her.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.039
Can't wait for you to tell us why.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.679
Obviously they had a quota
of country kids to fill,

20:39.680 --> 20:42.479
which is the only reason they
accepted her in the first place.

20:42.480 --> 20:46.479
But once they saw how far behind
she was, they had to ask her to leave.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.719
I mean, it wouldn't
be fair to the rest of us,

20:48.720 --> 20:50.519
being dragged down like that.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.359
I wouldn't say
she was dragging anybody down.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.359
- She danced her solo pretty well.
- Yeah.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.879
And what would you know?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.679
And do you HAVE to hang out
in the girls' dressing room?

20:58.680 --> 21:01.159
I mean, how much of a freak
do you want to be?

21:01.160 --> 21:04.359
Abigail, my mum taught me
that if you can't say anything nice,

21:04.360 --> 21:06.522
don't say anything at all.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.439
Tara, I thought you'd be packing.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.999
Why? I'm not going anywhere.
One bad class?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.765
You don't honestly think that
would be enough to make me quit?

21:17.760 --> 21:22.599
Well, if you're not leaving,
I'll be making an official complaint.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.919
I don't see why my training needs to
be compromised by some country hick

21:25.920 --> 21:27.959
who smells like a sheep
and thinks she has...

21:36.160 --> 21:39.926
Pointe shoe fight.
Greatest thing I have ever seen!

21:46.000 --> 21:49.209
I'm sorry. You're my teacher
and I have to trust you.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.050
Tara.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.519
You have unusually good feet.
They're just not ready yet.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.921
I'll give these back when they are.

22:01.920 --> 22:07.290
So this is O Week, week zero,
and I figured out my place.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.131
The thing about being at the bottom
is there's nowhere else to go but up.

22:35.320 --> 22:39.719
Mum, topped every class
except for hip-hop,

22:39.720 --> 22:41.722
but like that counts.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.368
It was you, wasn't it?

22:53.960 --> 22:56.406
You tried to sabotage me
in audition week.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.967
I don't get it.
You're the best dancer here.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.531
Why do you hate me so much?

23:17.800 --> 23:20.279
I've decided to listen
to Miss Raine about dancing,

23:20.280 --> 23:23.443
but pick my own friends.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.319
Coming to this place
is a little like New Year's Eve.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.439
You make all these resolutions
about who you're going to be

23:31.440 --> 23:33.647
and then break every one of them.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.439
Because no matter where you are,

23:36.440 --> 23:39.319
even if it's thousands
of kilometres from home,

23:39.320 --> 23:41.159
you'll always be yourself

23:41.160 --> 23:44.403
and sometimes that's
a pretty awesome thing.
