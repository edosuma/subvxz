AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.923 --> 00:09.511
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.594 --> 00:13.181
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.264 --> 00:16.017
But a foolish samurai warrior,

00:16.100 --> 00:18.520
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.603 --> 00:21.606
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:26.778 --> 00:29.405
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.489 --> 00:31.366
and flung him into the future,

00:31.449 --> 00:33.660
where my evil is law.

00:34.285 --> 00:38.039
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.122 --> 00:42.794
and undo the future that is Aku.

you can cut through them like butter.
