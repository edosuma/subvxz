PLANET IRELAND

01:32:16.081 --> 01:32:17.639
One, two, three....

01:32:26.225 --> 01:32:28.352
This idea has been
on my head for...

01:32:28.394 --> 01:32:29.952
more years, I wouId say

01:32:29.995 --> 01:32:31.326
I didn't reaIIy start focusing

01:32:31.363 --> 01:32:32.990
not untiI I reaIIy
started dancing

01:32:33.032 --> 01:32:34.329
in the Iast show

01:32:34.366 --> 01:32:36.334
And just when I was out there

01:32:36.368 --> 01:32:38.529
I start reaIizing that I
was dying to do something new

01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:39.901
I was dying to
try different things

01:32:39.938 --> 01:32:41.906
I was dying to go further
with the whoIe thing

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.703
And as a resuIt,

01:32:43.742 --> 01:32:46.074
everynight I started
hounding in on something new

01:32:46.111 --> 01:32:48.443
sequences that put together I
for this show

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.971
And I never dreamed that I
break off with that other show

01:32:51.016 --> 01:32:52.244
but faith went to hand

01:32:52.284 --> 01:32:54.650
that's why
we get the chance to do this

01:32:54.687 --> 01:32:56.416
and now we have
aII these peopIe here

01:32:56.455 --> 01:32:58.650
I don't pick and choose
from other dance forms

01:32:58.691 --> 01:33:00.352
What I do is...
What I do is go inside

01:33:00.392 --> 01:33:03.361
for whatever.... Whatever I'm
trying to create comes out...

01:33:03.395 --> 01:33:04.623
comes from inside

01:33:04.663 --> 01:33:07.029
The trick here
and probabIy the biggest...

01:33:07.066 --> 01:33:11.002
the hardest task is to constantIy
create something compIeteIy new

01:33:11.036 --> 01:33:13.027
that's not something
that you'II see on teIevision

01:33:13.072 --> 01:33:14.539
it with the modern dance,
accompany with the Jazz

01:33:14.573 --> 01:33:16.939
accompany with the fIamenco,
accompany with the tap, accompany...

01:33:16.975 --> 01:33:18.738
you won't see this stuff
anywhere eIse in the worId

01:33:18.777 --> 01:33:20.506
'cause it doesn't come from
anywhere eIse in the worId

01:33:20.546 --> 01:33:22.309
where create it here,
we create it on our own

01:33:22.948 --> 01:33:25.849
the first rehearsaI I saw

01:33:25.884 --> 01:33:27.852
and they had put together about

01:33:27.886 --> 01:33:30.514
3 of the numbers
before I've got here

01:33:30.556 --> 01:33:33.548
I was just in tears,
my spine was tingIing

01:33:33.592 --> 01:33:34.991
I've never seen anything Iike it

01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:38.554
everything was bound together
so perfectIy

01:33:38.597 --> 01:33:41.725
such a perfect meeting
of music and dance

01:33:41.767 --> 01:33:43.894
emotion and feeIing

01:33:43.936 --> 01:33:46.370
great great beauty and passion

01:33:46.405 --> 01:33:48.635
I thought this is just
the most exciting dancing

01:33:48.674 --> 01:33:50.471
that I've ever seen

01:34:01.987 --> 01:34:03.579
there are so few peopIe
to do this

01:34:03.622 --> 01:34:06.921
they've search far and wide
to find this Irish dancers

01:34:06.959 --> 01:34:08.187
It wasn't the one step

01:34:08.227 --> 01:34:09.819
came through the audition
and find coIors

01:34:09.862 --> 01:34:11.352
because they were so eager

01:34:11.396 --> 01:34:12.954
and they were wiIIing to
try aII these new things

01:34:12.998 --> 01:34:14.966
and wiIIing to go
to the next IeveI

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.262
money wasn't important to them

01:34:16.301 --> 01:34:17.893
hours and the day
weren't important to them

01:34:17.936 --> 01:34:19.563
these girIs finish here

01:34:19.605 --> 01:34:21.004
and they were exhausted

01:34:21.039 --> 01:34:22.836
they were high spirited group

01:34:22.875 --> 01:34:25.207
and that's not too difficuIt

01:34:25.244 --> 01:34:27.735
they are great to work with

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:32.877
they know because they have
work so hard in the dancing

01:34:32.918 --> 01:34:35.250
Iike most of them were champions

01:34:35.754 --> 01:34:37.085
were very high pIaced

01:34:37.122 --> 01:34:39.989
so aII through the dancing
they had to work hard

01:34:40.025 --> 01:34:40.787
and there is a new thing

01:34:40.826 --> 01:34:42.225
don't forget no one
has ever tried this before

01:34:42.261 --> 01:34:43.785
nobody has ever
done a show Iike this

01:34:43.829 --> 01:34:45.524
with the different types
of tap sign

01:34:45.564 --> 01:34:46.792
and different kinds of steps

01:34:46.832 --> 01:34:48.459
everything they're doing
is acceIerated

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.195
it's taken to the tenth degree

01:34:50.235 --> 01:34:52.965
the injury rate is very high

01:34:53.005 --> 01:34:54.836
because to keep the position

01:34:54.873 --> 01:34:57.603
it's constant, constant,
constant driIIing

01:34:57.643 --> 01:34:59.873
I wanted peopIe that were
honest about their work

01:34:59.912 --> 01:35:01.573
and genuineIy enthusiastic

01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:03.410
but I aIso wanted peopIe
that couId think for themseIves

01:35:03.448 --> 01:35:06.315
the whoIe idea here is to
stimuIate the younger minds

01:35:06.351 --> 01:35:07.875
I show them the work
that I want them to do

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.820
I teach them the steps,
I choreograph the pieces

01:35:09.855 --> 01:35:11.186
I direct them with what they do

01:35:11.223 --> 01:35:12.747
and after that, it's up to them

01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:14.691
to strengthen themseIves
and to go on further

01:35:14.726 --> 01:35:16.853
when I'm done they shouId
be abIe to do twice as far

01:35:16.895 --> 01:35:20.524
You can't prevent or stop
injuries compIeteIy

01:35:20.566 --> 01:35:21.555
the strain on their Ieg...

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.330
I mean the onIy time that I've
experience something Iike this

01:35:24.369 --> 01:35:27.099
was reaIIy working with....

01:35:27.139 --> 01:35:28.037
baIIet companies

01:35:28.073 --> 01:35:32.772
we do a very strict session
on warming up, stretching out...

01:35:59.071 --> 01:36:01.301
I don't think there is a troupe
in the worId that works harder

01:36:09.381 --> 01:36:10.780
this is the onIy dance
form the worId

01:36:10.816 --> 01:36:13.876
but I know I prove we dance
percussiveIy to the music

01:36:13.919 --> 01:36:15.443
we dance exactIy to the music

01:36:15.487 --> 01:36:16.977
we don't improvise
around the music

01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:19.149
we don't studious
IittIe penance

01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:20.624
when we go off
we come right back

01:36:20.659 --> 01:36:22.456
so it's no different for us

01:36:22.494 --> 01:36:25.224
then watching at Price Fighter

01:36:25.264 --> 01:36:26.925
when he Iance punch
one, two, three, four

01:36:26.965 --> 01:36:28.865
the crowd wants to
such an enormous row

01:36:28.901 --> 01:36:30.368
the crowd wouId get so excited,

01:36:30.402 --> 01:36:31.869
you know
they are with him everyway

01:36:31.904 --> 01:36:35.169
from that incessant sound
of the feet

01:36:35.207 --> 01:36:38.938
and the way they use the dance

01:36:40.012 --> 01:36:42.344
with those driving beat
into the fIoor

01:36:42.381 --> 01:36:44.246
it's Iike it's teIIing a story

01:36:44.283 --> 01:36:45.750
it's Iike it Iives yourseIf

01:36:52.024 --> 01:36:54.185
it works so much
in sexuaI energy

01:36:54.226 --> 01:36:56.694
and chemistry
between the mascuIine dancers

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:59.595
and the femaIe dancers
their energy is so powerfuI

01:36:59.631 --> 01:37:02.099
and I've created it is in a way

01:37:02.134 --> 01:37:04.659
that they are
so dramaticaIIy different

01:37:04.703 --> 01:37:07.103
that each one is taken so far

01:37:07.139 --> 01:37:08.436
when they come together

01:37:08.473 --> 01:37:09.701
the Iight and the dark shade

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:11.368
has portrays the energies
as the opposites

01:38:19.544 --> 01:38:21.205
when they finaIIy come together
in the end of the first haIf

01:38:21.246 --> 01:38:23.680
and they dance together
for the first time, reaIIy

01:38:23.715 --> 01:38:25.114
it was an extraordinary moment

01:38:58.617 --> 01:38:59.675
one of the greatest moments
so far

01:38:59.718 --> 01:39:01.982
was the finishing of the number
Lord of the dance itseIf

01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.317
when that Iine comes together

01:39:03.355 --> 01:39:05.789
and that was a big height
for me, it's a huge thing

01:39:05.824 --> 01:39:09.851
the best is when they've
come out, when we have compIeted

01:39:09.895 --> 01:39:11.954
and choreograph the piece

01:39:11.997 --> 01:39:14.591
and they have come out,
and performed it

01:39:27.779 --> 01:39:28.939
there has to be a centraI focus

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:31.175
there's times when I need to be
reaIIy hard and reaIIy tough

01:39:31.216 --> 01:39:33.116
I'm sorry.
That's not good enough

01:39:33.151 --> 01:39:35.142
Come on, everybody.
This is front stage,

01:39:35.187 --> 01:39:36.779
if you do this,
what do you think?

01:39:39.124 --> 01:39:40.352
the trick here is to reaIize

01:39:40.392 --> 01:39:41.882
that no matter what you do

01:39:41.927 --> 01:39:44.191
everyday is gonna be more
difficuIt than the one before

01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:45.696
if you're use to
the constant change

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:47.322
if you're use to
the constant probIems

01:39:47.365 --> 01:39:49.230
if you just accept that
from the beginning

01:39:49.267 --> 01:39:50.325
then you're gonna get through it

01:39:50.368 --> 01:39:52.097
if you don't,
you'II never gonna get anywhere

01:39:58.577 --> 01:40:01.341
MichaeI is being puIIed
in every kind of direction

01:40:01.379 --> 01:40:02.812
he's the creator of the show

01:40:02.848 --> 01:40:03.974
he's producing the show

01:40:04.015 --> 01:40:05.277
he's aIso the star of the show

01:40:05.317 --> 01:40:06.875
and he has puIIed himseIf
to think about

01:40:16.094 --> 01:40:17.322
I can't imagine

01:40:17.362 --> 01:40:19.956
ever what it wouId be Iike
to sit out in an audience

01:40:19.998 --> 01:40:22.193
for the first time
and experience it

01:40:22.234 --> 01:40:24.099
I think the audience
are just gonna get nuts

01:40:27.572 --> 01:40:28.937
we didn't come here
to finish second
