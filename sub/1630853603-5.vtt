00:07.975 --> 00:11.211
(train rumbling)

00:23.123 --> 00:25.692
(dark, suspenseful music plays)

00:32.065 --> 00:34.534
(upbeat music playing)

00:46.280 --> 00:47.180
(water runs)

01:06.633 --> 01:08.302
(thuds)

01:08.335 --> 01:09.303
SYDNEY'S FATHER:
Baby?

01:09.336 --> 01:10.437
(softly)
Sorry, Dad.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.649
(train rumbling)

01:54.615 --> 01:56.349
Um, can I?

02:00.387 --> 02:03.057
Was looking at your COGS.

02:03.090 --> 02:06.493
You're right... check average
gets killed at night.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.296
The price is too low.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.298
Barely covers labor.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.700
Sandwiches at night.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.401
-CARMY: Killer.
-Total killer.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.139
We need a new dinner menu.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.273
Hundred percent.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.212
-For the new menu--
-Mm-hmm.

02:25.245 --> 02:29.216
I was thinking maybe
a play on "Tongue & Cheek"?

02:29.249 --> 02:30.517
CARMY:
Ox tongue?

02:30.550 --> 02:32.319
Or braised beef,

02:32.352 --> 02:33.653
maybe short rib...

02:34.821 --> 02:36.156
and risotto.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.660
Yeah. Maybe.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.496
Man, this book is wild.

02:42.529 --> 02:45.165
-CARMY:
Yo, you just get here?
-Uh, nah.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.201
Uh, Chefs, we got
any non-iodized salt?

02:47.234 --> 02:48.602
CARMY:
Yeah. In the walk-in.
How we doing on cakes?

02:48.635 --> 02:49.737
About to fire 'em up.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.038
CARMY:
Please hustle on that, alright?

02:51.071 --> 02:52.305
MARCUS:
I gotcha.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.409
CARMY:
Sorry. Just, uh, scissors.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.211
For what?

02:57.244 --> 02:59.146
CARMY:
One side looks like shit.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.415
Both sides look
like shit in here.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.449
MARCUS:
Yes, Chef.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.619
(rumbling)

03:05.652 --> 03:07.821
-(water running)
-(rattling)

03:07.854 --> 03:09.256
The fuck was that?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.492
(water gurgling)

03:18.398 --> 03:20.200
Oh, no, I know what this is.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.637
CARMY:
Fuck!

03:23.670 --> 03:26.173
SYDNEY:
This is fucked.
We need to close for lunch.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.410
No. No, no, no. We lose
one service, it could kill us.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.211
You don't think this
is putting at a risk

03:31.244 --> 03:32.646
for losing a service, no?

03:32.679 --> 03:33.547
No, this is fine.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.514
Cool. Good.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.184
Yo, Fak. Yeah, we need
you here ASAP, bro.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.352
The toilet is fucked.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.288
Yo! What is good,
you fuckin' replicants?

03:41.321 --> 03:42.456
-EBRAHEIM: Toilet exploded.
-Yeah.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.559
-Is that funny? Is that good?
-Uh, Tina, Sydney, Ebra,

03:45.592 --> 03:47.127
you guys, with me
in the kitchen.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.196
We're gonna go over
that new menu still, okay?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.398
Marcus, desserts, please.
Thank you, Chef.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.435
Uh, Manny, Angel, Cousin,
just lock this shit down.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.670
Get it dried off.
Fak's bringing a shop vac, okay?

03:56.703 --> 03:58.372
Fak's mouth is a shop vac.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.542
Oh, my God,
you're so funny, Richie.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.744
Alright, guys.
This is some next-level shit.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.112
I'mma check out ground zero.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.619
CARMY:
Okay, so, see those
shallots, the garlic,

04:11.652 --> 04:13.220
they're starting to caramelize?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.223
Yeah, so we're gonna add
a little bit of capers.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.224
Gonna cook that.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.325
Many components, Carmen.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.459
I know. I know.
Just hear me out.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.362
We gotta get a new dinner menu,
we can hire more cooks,

04:21.395 --> 04:22.696
we get more help around here.

04:22.729 --> 04:26.200
Okay, we're gonna add
a little bit of white wine.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.501
Let that reduce.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.737
And, then you've got
some hot stock.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.273
Let that deglaze
the bottom of the pan.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.275
Okay, that's looking good.
You can turn the heat off now.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.476
And we're going to monter,

04:35.509 --> 04:38.178
or, um, we're going
to, uh, whisk in

04:38.211 --> 04:41.081
about two tablespoons of butter.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.050
You can see it's starting
to get kinda glossy.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.319
That's that sauce
that's starting to happen,

04:45.352 --> 04:47.554
and do a little bit
of pepper, salt,

04:47.587 --> 04:49.789
a squeeze of lemon, parsley.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.232
And now, we're gonna spoon
it out nice and easy.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.667
Take your time.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.268
T, you wanna try this?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.736
Yeah. You know it, Jeff.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.770
Here we go.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.175
(softly) Mm.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.246
Mm.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.247
CARMY:
Good?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.615
Mm.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.417
Good. Yes, Jeff.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.551
FAK:
It smells so good in here.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.587
Fak Attack!

05:19.620 --> 05:21.088
-You got LaTrina?
-EBRAHEIM: LaTrina.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.590
-LaTrina.
-Okay, okay, okay.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.624
We're gonna fix it. It's okay.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.528
And this one time...
(grunts)

05:27.561 --> 05:29.330
when I was a kid,
I thought I saw a dragon.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.032
Just pay attention!
Don't strip the thread.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.801
I'm not stripping the thread.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.738
(grunting)

05:37.771 --> 05:40.341
-Stop trying to fuck me.
-I'm not trying
to fuck you, bro.

05:40.374 --> 05:43.177
Dude, it's a Human Resources
offense, dude.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.746
Oh yeah? Guess what?
You're looking
at Human Resources.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.548
-Really?
-RICHIE: Yeah.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.282
(panting)

05:51.084 --> 05:53.687
Carmy says he's
down a couple cooks.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.090
Do you think that I can apply
for that job application?

06:03.175 --> 06:05.432
CHESTER:
"Yeasts in stasis,
their microbial..."

06:05.465 --> 06:07.434
Yo, I really love science.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.103
Yo, is this warm enough?

06:09.136 --> 06:10.004
CHESTER:
Think so.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.306
-Hey, yo, check this shit.
-What's up?

06:12.339 --> 06:14.141
MARCUS:
Take a whiff.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.576
-Oh, my God!
-MARCUS: Yeah.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.177
Yo, should we do a bakery?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.747
Alright, just finish
the instructions.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.816
"There are two ways to go
about lacto-fermentation."

06:22.849 --> 06:24.418
Facts.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.787
Yo, we need to go to Copenhagen
and fuck that place up.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.389
MARCUS:
What are the two ways? Okay?

06:28.422 --> 06:30.424
CHESTER:
Uh, "You can ferment
the raw product

06:30.457 --> 06:33.394
in either vacuum-sealed
plastic bag or..."

06:33.427 --> 06:35.496
-MARCUS: Uh. Yo, Carmy?
-CARMY: Yo.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.665
MARCUS:
Uh, can I borrow
a sous vide bag, Chef?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.066
CARMY:
The fuck you doing?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.367
Fermenting.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.102
-CARMY: You know how to seal it?
-No, Chef.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.737
We can learn.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.205
CARMY:
Uh, okay. Above the locker.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.740
CHESTER:
Thanks, Chef Carmy.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.275
CARMY:
Welcome, Chester.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.543
My guy.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.278
Yo, what time you home tonight?

06:51.311 --> 06:52.646
-Should I save Bachelorette?
-I'mma be late.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.215
Just watch it without me,
but, hey, don't ruin
that shit again.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.717
I didn't ruin shit.
You asked me what happened.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.053
Yeah, and you
told me every detail
of the whole episode.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.354
Then don't ask me
what happened--

07:00.387 --> 07:01.689
Marcus, we good
on cakes, Chef?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.123
Please don't get
lost in that shit.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.525
-MARCUS: We good, Chef.
-I trust you.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.428
Marcus is Minnie Minoso
of Illinois Fermentation.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.729
ANGEL:
Who's Minnie Minoso?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.464
ALL:
Mr. White Sox.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.331
I guess he was good.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.234
First black player
for the White Sox.

07:13.267 --> 07:19.039
Stole 167 bases,
195 home runs, 1,100 RBIs,

07:19.072 --> 07:20.708
and a career batting
average of 300,

07:20.741 --> 07:22.176
so, not bad.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.245
-Two hours, service, Chefs.
-ALL: Yes, Chef.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.346
CARMY:
Hey, how we looking up front?

07:25.379 --> 07:27.248
-Shitty but better, Chef.
-CARMY: I'll take that.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.683
TINA:
Jeff, look at
the coloring on this.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.318
Yeah, you're gonna wanna
take that a little bit darker.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.319
You see that brown
spot right there?

07:32.352 --> 07:34.221
We wanna see that
everywhere on the bottom.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.490
That way, when the stock hits,
gonna scrape up all that,

07:36.523 --> 07:38.492
that's gonna get that
flavor into the onion.

07:38.525 --> 07:39.727
When'd Mikey
make that for you?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.528
-TINA: Christmas.
-My Mom's?

07:41.561 --> 07:43.797
-TINA: Mm-hmm.
-She full psycho?

07:43.830 --> 07:47.201
She wasn't calm,
but the food was great.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.235
Alright, looks good.
Two more minutes,

07:48.268 --> 07:49.403
add that stock.
Okay, Chef?

07:49.436 --> 07:50.503
-Alright. Got it, Jeff.
-CARMY: Thank you.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.741
-I graduated high school.
-RICHIE: Good start.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.175
FAK:
Be serious, man.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.610
I'm being serious.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.513
What might you bring
to The Beef as a new employee?

07:59.546 --> 08:00.814
I got hearth.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.383
-What's hearth?
-Heart-- (sighs).

08:02.416 --> 08:04.251
I'm nervous, man.
I got heart.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.253
Ah, you're gonna need brain.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.756
Now, do you have any
special skills or abilities

08:08.789 --> 08:10.424
asides from being
a fuckin' stroke?

08:10.457 --> 08:12.326
Well, A, I'm not
a fuckin' stroke,

08:12.359 --> 08:14.228
and, B, I'm really good
on the keyboard--

08:14.261 --> 08:16.764
No, A, you are,
and, B, no, you're not.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.198
Well, A, yes, I am,

08:18.231 --> 08:20.200
and, B, I joined
a jazz fusion class,

08:20.233 --> 08:21.268
so, in your face.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.436
A, I've heard you fuckin' play,

08:22.469 --> 08:23.571
and you're fuckin' terrible!

08:23.604 --> 08:25.239
And, C, it's
a fuckin' restaurant!

08:25.272 --> 08:27.074
Why do I give a fuck
that you play the keyboard?

08:27.107 --> 08:29.643
I'm a hard worker.
I'm a nice guy!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.745
-I got a great vibe.
-Fuck your vibe.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.181
Don't ever fuck my vibe.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.051
I swear to God, I will
fuck anything I wanna fuck.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.286
You are not being nice
and you will not fuck me.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.320
Mm-mmm.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.458
(indistinct yelling)

08:47.127 --> 08:49.129
Get off! You prick!

08:49.162 --> 08:50.431
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

08:50.464 --> 08:51.498
RICHIE:
Stop shouting!

08:51.531 --> 08:54.235
-(grunting)
-Get off of me!

08:54.268 --> 08:56.070
-SWEEPS: Should I break it up?
-Get off me!

08:56.103 --> 08:57.404
MANNY:
What's the point?

08:57.437 --> 08:58.672
Yo, yo! Should I break this up?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.207
-Yes!
-No!

09:00.240 --> 09:01.175
-Yes!
-Say, "Matae!"

09:01.208 --> 09:02.810
No way! Never!

09:02.843 --> 09:04.144
Oh, that's cool.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.247
(Richie and Fak
yelling indistinctly)

09:06.280 --> 09:08.048
-Say, "Matae!"
-You're so weak.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.083
(screams) My nipple!

09:09.116 --> 09:10.251
Whoa, should I break this up?

09:15.188 --> 09:16.724
What the fuck, Carmy?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.225
Hey, guys, can you

09:18.258 --> 09:19.693
-He is mean!
-RICHIE: Cousin, you know me.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.696
He is fuckin' not nice!
He is a fuckin' asshole!

09:22.729 --> 09:26.133
-...baby who has no
problem-solving skills!
-I wasn't even gonna say this.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.468
He is selling fuckin' coke

09:27.501 --> 09:29.103
in the back alley of The Beef!

09:29.136 --> 09:30.204
Wait, wait, wait, what?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.639
Stop, stop, stop! What? Fak?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.073
-FAK: He is selling--
-Fak!

09:33.106 --> 09:34.308
He is selling coke

09:34.341 --> 09:36.176

alleyway, man.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.578
RICHIE:
Oh, are you happy now

09:39.179 --> 09:40.547
FAK:
Mommy knows now.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.349
Fuck you.
You're such an asshole.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.418
I see you.
I fuckin' see you, Neil Jeff.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.025
(upbeat music playing)

10:04.071 --> 10:05.506
(clock ticking)

10:05.539 --> 10:07.107
Shit.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.025
Cool.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.766
Ah, shit.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.106
It's not that big a deal.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.374
FAK: I shouldn't have
fuckin' said anything--

10:40.407 --> 10:43.377
Just shut the fuck up, narc.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.046
Look, I don't
deal deal like that.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.180
You know, like...

10:48.582 --> 10:51.785
I distribute just
little bits here and there

10:51.818 --> 10:54.555
-when I'm holding, you know.
-Out of my restaurant.

10:54.588 --> 10:57.324
Outta the alley behind
your brother's restaurant

10:57.357 --> 10:58.491
to help it.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.629
Wasn't my idea, by the way.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.600
Whose idea was it?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.035
RICHIE:
(scoffs) Come on, man.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.170
Think you can guess, Cousin.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.705
Let me ask you something.

11:11.738 --> 11:16.277
How the fuck do you think
we made it through COVID, huh?

11:16.310 --> 11:17.745
Side hustle.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.580
And that's the kinda
stick-to-it-ive-ness

11:19.613 --> 11:22.449
and ingenuity
and out-of-the-box thinking

11:22.482 --> 11:24.318
that we look for in employees.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.687
But that ship has
sailed, my friend.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.488
(rattling)

11:30.857 --> 11:32.192
I sh-sh-should call,
I should call

11:32.225 --> 11:34.495
the fucking police on you.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.597
I should call the police on you
for being a naive pussy--

11:36.630 --> 11:38.432
No, we're done.
We're done with this
fuckin' bullshit, okay?

11:38.465 --> 11:39.733
We're done with
your stupid friends.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.235
We're done with Nico.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.137
Oh, my-- Nico's got
nothing to do with this.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.238
-That's something else--
-Richie, I swear to God--

11:44.271 --> 11:46.140
-RICHIE: Alright, relax.
-Swear to God!

11:46.173 --> 11:47.474
Don't blow a fuse, alright?

11:47.507 --> 11:48.609
(rattling)

11:48.642 --> 11:50.310
(electricity crackles,
powers off)

11:53.213 --> 11:55.382
(Richie laughs)
Fuckin' A.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.653
(mouths)
Fuck me.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.058
(lever clicks)

12:04.091 --> 12:06.386
-Kitchen?
-Out.

12:06.419 --> 12:08.221
-RICHIE: Up front?
-Off!

12:08.254 --> 12:10.223
-RICHIE: Walk-in?
-Kitchen works!

12:10.256 --> 12:11.357
Walk-in's toast.

12:14.427 --> 12:16.529
That's every bag of ice
in River North.

12:17.563 --> 12:18.498
Fak, how we looking?

12:18.531 --> 12:19.966
Good news or bad news, Carmy.

12:19.999 --> 12:21.968
-Sure.
-Yeah. Condenser is fried.

12:22.001 --> 12:23.903
It's gonna cost
a couple racks to fix,

12:23.936 --> 12:26.506
but I got a connect
on a condenser guy.

12:26.539 --> 12:28.441
-What's good news?
-The connect!

12:28.474 --> 12:30.443
Ah, okay. Um...

12:30.476 --> 12:31.377
(ticking)

12:31.410 --> 12:32.612
You know what,
actually, change of plans.

12:32.645 --> 12:35.315
We're gonna take everything.
Just take it outside, alright?

12:35.348 --> 12:36.482
-Take it outside.
-And do what with it?

12:38.384 --> 12:39.986
Alright, let's go, let's go.

12:41.254 --> 12:43.823
Yo, my guy.

12:43.856 --> 12:45.458
Yeah, can I ask you a favor?

12:50.129 --> 12:52.098
Glad I was working
from home today, huh?

12:52.131 --> 12:53.233
Dude, you're a lifesaver, Petey.

12:53.266 --> 12:54.501
Yeah, you're
a real stud, Petey.

12:54.534 --> 12:55.835
Ah, thanks, Cousin.

12:55.868 --> 12:56.569
I ain't your cousin.

12:56.602 --> 12:57.837
Very well.

12:57.870 --> 13:00.072
Sorry, not my cousin either.

13:01.307 --> 13:03.877
Uh... Hey, everyone.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.178
RICHIE:
Dum-dum-dum.

13:05.211 --> 13:07.280
Nice to see you guys.
What's going on?

13:07.313 --> 13:08.515
-RICHIE: Nothing.
-Hey, it's alright.

13:08.548 --> 13:09.849
We, uh, we asked

13:09.882 --> 13:11.117
Pete's permission here,
right, Pete?

13:11.150 --> 13:13.286
Ohh, you asked Pete.

13:13.319 --> 13:16.156
Yeah, honey.
I-I said it'd be cool if
they, uh, were to use the--

13:16.189 --> 13:18.358
Oh, okay.
Well, if you said
it would be cool.

13:18.391 --> 13:20.293
Yo, Pete, you gonna let
her talk to you like that?

13:20.326 --> 13:22.562
-Go fuck yourself, Richard.
-RICHIE: Yeah, I will.

13:22.595 --> 13:24.230
Hey, could we do this later?
I kinda got a lot going on.

13:24.263 --> 13:25.965
SUGAR:
Yeah. I also have
a lot going on.

13:25.998 --> 13:29.102
Did you know I recently
had a brother die too?

13:29.135 --> 13:30.136
RICHIE:
Dark.

13:33.005 --> 13:34.340
That was dark.

13:35.475 --> 13:37.277
(scoffs) Yeah.

13:37.310 --> 13:38.912
Course, you're a Cubs fan.

13:38.945 --> 13:41.114
Who doesn't love the Cubs?

13:41.147 --> 13:43.416
I bet you can't name
the first basemen.

13:43.449 --> 13:44.917
Alfonso Rivas.

13:48.121 --> 13:49.823
Hey, Nat, straight up,
that was fuckin' gnarly.

13:49.856 --> 13:51.291
You're such
a soft, shitty bitch.

13:51.324 --> 13:52.559
-What?
-SUGAR: You call Pete

13:52.592 --> 13:54.361
'cause you're too
scared to call me?

13:54.394 --> 13:56.229
-That's weak, bro.
-No, no, no. I call Pete

13:56.262 --> 13:58.098
'cause every time I call you,
you talk a bunch of shit

13:58.131 --> 13:59.399
and I can't really get
into a fight right now--

13:59.432 --> 14:01.368
You only call me
when you're freaking out.

14:01.401 --> 14:03.136
And since I know
you're low on time,

14:03.169 --> 14:04.371
here are the bullet points:

14:04.404 --> 14:06.172
you only appear
when you need something.

14:06.205 --> 14:07.974
You never got back
to me about the thing.

14:08.007 --> 14:09.376
You've spent every minute
since you've been back

14:09.409 --> 14:10.844
in that fucking restaurant,

14:10.877 --> 14:12.412
and now you're
taking advantage of Pete?

14:12.445 --> 14:15.181
Oh, and you know how much
I hate Richie being here.

14:15.214 --> 14:16.383
I'm fine with all that,

14:16.416 --> 14:18.251
except I do kinda
like Pete now and--

14:18.284 --> 14:19.819
Yeah, you have such
a fucking attitude.

14:19.852 --> 14:20.920
I went to the thing.

14:23.256 --> 14:26.226
Wh-- You-You went to a meeting?

14:26.259 --> 14:28.528
(indistinct chatter on TV)

14:28.561 --> 14:30.262
Yeah. I go three times a week.

14:32.131 --> 14:33.233
Where?

14:33.266 --> 14:34.333
River North.

14:35.334 --> 14:37.237
All family?

14:37.270 --> 14:38.405
All family, yeah.

14:38.438 --> 14:40.272
(chatter continues)

14:45.578 --> 14:47.914
SUGAR:
Will you fight with me tomorrow?

14:47.947 --> 14:48.948
CARMY:
Yeah.

14:51.351 --> 14:53.019
SYDNEY:
We got one hour
to service, Chefs.

14:53.052 --> 14:54.087
EBRAHEIM:
Chef, there's
no light out front.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.388
There's no more space.

14:55.421 --> 14:57.991
Okay. Um, that's fine.
That's okay.

14:58.024 --> 15:00.493
Uh, Angel, I want you to take
every single stock pot we have

15:00.526 --> 15:01.828
and put it on the stove.

15:01.861 --> 15:03.897
Ebra, get all the beef,

15:03.930 --> 15:05.432
put it in gravy, cover it,

15:05.465 --> 15:06.833
-warm it up for service.
-Yes, Chef.

15:06.866 --> 15:08.368
Tina, switch to potato prep.

15:08.401 --> 15:10.103
Manny, you and I are gonna
take all the vegetables

15:10.136 --> 15:11.371
that don't fit in the lowboy,

15:11.404 --> 15:13.907
all the chicken,
put 'em in the pots, cover 'em,

15:13.940 --> 15:15.542
stock it all, okay?

15:15.575 --> 15:17.110
MANNY:
So you've done this before?

15:17.143 --> 15:18.845
-Uh, something like that.
-Behind.

15:18.878 --> 15:20.113

15:23.883 --> 15:25.218
The pilot light is out.

15:25.251 --> 15:26.486
-Let me check it out.
-Okay.

15:26.519 --> 15:27.820
MANNY:
Try it now.

15:29.255 --> 15:30.356
TINA:
Still nothing.

15:31.057 --> 15:32.025
Neil!

15:32.058 --> 15:33.960
FAK:
Uh-oh. What now?

15:33.993 --> 15:35.295
EBRAHEIM:
Gas line down.

15:35.328 --> 15:36.963
(Fak groans and grunts)

15:36.996 --> 15:38.798
FAK:
Ugh! Son of a bitch.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.035
Chef, we can't open.

15:42.068 --> 15:44.304
(sniffs)
Yeah, no gas.

15:44.337 --> 15:45.839
FAK: Gary,
it's getting greasy in here.

15:45.872 --> 15:47.374
Are they still building

17:13.259 --> 17:17.364
Fucked up...
Um, I was behind on cakes.

17:17.397 --> 17:19.465
Tried to speed it up
and I blew the fuse.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.968
This job's insane.

17:22.001 --> 17:24.270
(lighter clicks)

17:24.303 --> 17:26.172
Yeah, it could go from chill
to unchill in a second,

17:26.205 --> 17:27.374
but you gotta stay ahead
on your work.

17:27.407 --> 17:28.374
That's just that.

17:29.175 --> 17:31.244
MARCUS:
Heard.

17:31.277 --> 17:33.179
You know, my first job
was McDonald's,

17:33.212 --> 17:34.414
and you don't
get to be creative.

17:34.447 --> 17:36.516
You just work with robots

17:36.549 --> 17:39.819
and everything's automatic
and fast and easy.

17:41.554 --> 17:43.890
I won't make a mistake again.

17:43.923 --> 17:45.392
CARMY:
Yeah, you will.

17:45.425 --> 17:48.961
But not 'cause you're you,
just 'cause shit happens.

17:51.431 --> 17:53.299
I started a fryer fire

17:53.332 --> 17:55.368
night after I won
Food & Wine's Best New Chef.

17:55.401 --> 17:56.836
Nearly burned the place down.

17:56.869 --> 17:58.270
-For real?
-CARMY: For real.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.308
This weird thing happens too.

18:02.341 --> 18:04.310
You have this minute
where you--

18:04.343 --> 18:06.012
you're watching the fire
and you're thinking...

18:07.313 --> 18:08.547
"If I don't do anything...

18:09.882 --> 18:12.352
"this place will burn down...

18:12.385 --> 18:14.387
and all my anxiety
will go away with it."

18:16.589 --> 18:18.057
And then you put the fire out.

18:19.859 --> 18:21.394
Then you put the fire out.

18:23.029 --> 18:23.930
So what's up?

18:23.963 --> 18:25.231
You wanna be a baby
for another minute,

18:25.264 --> 18:26.098
or you trying to party?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.235
-Let's party, man.
-CARMY: Let's party.

18:33.306 --> 18:35.474
SYDNEY:
Chef, get in there. Let's go.
Toughen up. Come on.

18:38.478 --> 18:40.079
CUSTOMER:
Hey, kudos to the chef.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.384
(footsteps)

18:47.587 --> 18:48.588
CARMY:
$5,500?

18:48.621 --> 18:51.091
FAK:
Yeah. I'm sorry,
but, yes, dude. Yeah.

18:51.124 --> 18:52.925
-Bro?
-Bro.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.395
You said you had a connect.

18:55.428 --> 18:57.163
Yeah, I definitely,
definitely did not--

18:57.196 --> 18:58.832
don't ha--
don't have a connect.

18:58.865 --> 19:00.834
(inhales and exhales)

19:00.867 --> 19:02.868
How are we gonna
get $5,500 that fast?

19:07.440 --> 19:09.475
Fuck!

19:12.879 --> 19:15.147
It's pretty interesting
you guys coming to me now.

19:16.449 --> 19:18.084
I don't know.

19:18.117 --> 19:20.520
Obviously, I'mma
have to think about it.

19:20.553 --> 19:21.421
Cousin, it's one more time.

19:21.454 --> 19:24.124
It's never again.
I want it far away.

19:24.157 --> 19:26.259
I don't wanna know the details.

19:26.292 --> 19:27.494
We need this.

19:27.527 --> 19:29.829
The fridge won't work
without a condenser.

19:29.862 --> 19:30.529
We?

19:31.264 --> 19:32.331
We?

19:33.266 --> 19:34.401
Say, "Matae."

19:34.434 --> 19:35.435
Richie.

19:35.468 --> 19:37.103
No. Say, "Matae," Neil.

19:39.272 --> 19:40.473
You didn't even win.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.476
This is me winning.

19:46.946 --> 19:47.980
Say, "Matae."

19:49.282 --> 19:50.850
Say it, Fak.

19:50.883 --> 19:52.952
Carm.

19:52.985 --> 19:54.387
CARMY:
Say, "Matae," bro.

19:56.889 --> 19:58.091
Fuck it.

19:58.124 --> 19:59.959
Matae, matae, matae.

20:04.063 --> 20:06.065
Your wish is my command, Neil.

20:08.534 --> 20:10.904
Cousin, this is
the last time, right?

20:10.937 --> 20:11.937
Yeah.

20:13.139 --> 20:15.541
-Richard.
-(sighs)

20:17.276 --> 20:20.246
Carmen... I understand.

20:21.414 --> 20:23.416
(electricity buzzing)

20:26.252 --> 20:27.787
Thank fuck!

20:30.390 --> 20:31.390
Alright.

20:46.824 --> 20:47.858
Chef.

20:50.517 --> 20:51.519
You okay?

20:51.552 --> 20:52.619
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

20:58.492 --> 21:00.027
You were great today.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.428
-Thank you.
-SYDNEY: Hmm.

21:02.229 --> 21:03.764
Thanks.

21:03.797 --> 21:06.934
It really reminded me
of like catering.

21:06.967 --> 21:09.469
Just that energy. I don't know.

21:10.671 --> 21:11.806
CARMY:
What was the deal with that?

21:11.839 --> 21:13.040
Was that just like
the world or--

21:13.073 --> 21:14.175
SYDNEY:
Oh, jeez.

21:14.208 --> 21:16.576
It was a lot of things.

21:17.845 --> 21:20.647
Got too big too fast.

21:23.250 --> 21:27.655
Wasn't exactly liquid enough
for a brick and mortar.

21:27.688 --> 21:32.493
And so running it out
of my garage was... stupid.

21:32.526 --> 21:33.894
Uh...

21:33.927 --> 21:35.629
My credit got destroyed.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.666
I mean,
my whole shit got rocked,

21:38.699 --> 21:42.136
and there's not a night
I don't stay up just thinking

21:42.169 --> 21:44.171
about what I could've
done different.

21:45.939 --> 21:49.143
Like, it was the first time
I didn't have a complete

21:49.176 --> 21:51.178
and utter psychopath behind me

21:51.211 --> 21:54.515
screaming and pushing
and yelling.

21:54.548 --> 21:55.349
And...

21:56.817 --> 21:58.852
I thought
I-I wanted that, you know.

22:01.221 --> 22:03.524
But...

22:03.557 --> 22:04.891
look where that got me, so.

22:07.661 --> 22:08.729
Heard, Chef.

22:11.065 --> 22:12.800
Um, can you,

22:12.833 --> 22:14.535
can you help me
strain the stock?

22:14.568 --> 22:15.903
CARMY:
Yeah, of course. Yes, Chef.

22:15.936 --> 22:18.905
