- Oh, shit.

20:24.814 --> 20:28.318
I needed to think
this through more. [sobs]

20:28.418 --> 20:30.186
- Wait. I have an idea.

20:30.286 --> 20:31.821
- ED AND GRANDMA: You do?
- You do?

20:31.921 --> 20:35.291
- What if instead of
the bus, I drove you?

20:35.391 --> 20:38.061
- Yes! Oh my god, yes!
And we can take turns driving

20:38.194 --> 20:41.397
and putting our hand out the
window and doing the arm worm.

20:41.497 --> 20:44.033
- No, I only drive my car.
You don't--you can't.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.468
You can do the arm worm, though.

20:45.568 --> 20:46.903
- Deal!
- Really?

20:47.003 --> 20:48.571
- Los Angeles, here we come!

20:48.671 --> 20:50.406
- Yes! Yes!
