01:15.720 --> 01:17.621
What have we, George?

01:17.689 --> 01:19.623
Sir, he's as yet unidentified.

01:19.691 --> 01:21.959
Young Mr. Hawkins here
discovered him at first light.

01:22.027 --> 01:23.993
He summoned a patrolling constable.

01:24.061 --> 01:25.628
Oh, that's a good lad.

01:25.696 --> 01:27.931
Um, do you recognize

01:27.998 --> 01:29.899
- the pitchfork?
- Yes, sir.

01:29.967 --> 01:33.102
- I use it to muck out the stalls.
- Mm.

01:33.170 --> 01:34.804
Did you walk

01:34.872 --> 01:37.740
- around the body at all?
- No, sir.

01:37.808 --> 01:40.275
I saw him when I arrived.

01:40.342 --> 01:42.544
I didn't come in. I was scared.

01:42.612 --> 01:45.614
Yes, of course. Anyone would have been.

01:45.682 --> 01:47.716
- Do you know this man?
- Yes, sir.

01:47.784 --> 01:50.085
- Do you know his name?
- No,

01:50.152 --> 01:52.487
but he gives me a few coppers
to brush down his horse

01:52.555 --> 01:54.155
when he comes to the hotel.

01:54.223 --> 01:55.923
Was he a frequent visitor?

01:55.991 --> 01:57.925
Fairly so.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.729
Right then, George, I'll
need my footprint-casting kit.

02:01.797 --> 02:04.665
Sir, right away. Good job, son.

02:08.036 --> 02:10.204
Tundall, no one in or out. Understand?

02:10.270 --> 02:13.039
- Right.
- Constable!

02:13.107 --> 02:15.575
Constable! Help me.

02:15.643 --> 02:18.612
- Oh, please, help me.
- Madame, what's wrong?

02:18.679 --> 02:21.014
I need the protection of
the Toronto Constabulary.

02:21.082 --> 02:23.116
I'm being confined against my will.

02:23.183 --> 02:25.118
- Sir!
- Oh, I beg you.

02:25.185 --> 02:27.786
Please take me to a place of safety.

02:27.854 --> 02:29.554
What is it, George?

02:29.623 --> 02:32.891
Sir, this woman claims to be...

02:32.959 --> 02:36.461
- Miss Dawes!
- It's too late. She's discovered my ruse.

02:36.529 --> 02:38.731
Thank the blessed Lord
you've come to no harm.

02:38.798 --> 02:42.067
Don't be deceived by her piety.

02:42.135 --> 02:45.960
- Uh, what's going on here?
- This is Miss Felicity Dawes, sir.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.379
And you are?

02:47.422 --> 02:49.657
Miss Isabel Webster, Miss Dawes' nurse.

02:49.725 --> 02:53.427
Uh... Miss Dawes, is this your nurse?

02:53.496 --> 02:57.499
Isabel? Of course she
is. Why are you asking?

02:57.566 --> 03:00.433
Are you or are you not
being held against your will?

03:00.502 --> 03:03.136
Of course not!

03:03.204 --> 03:05.338
Miss Dawes is not of sound mind.

03:05.406 --> 03:08.174
She has a vivid imagination
and is easily alarmed.

03:08.242 --> 03:10.377
Ah, so this is all a big

03:10.444 --> 03:13.647
misunderstanding, then.
Thank you, Miss Webster.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.982
Who will care

03:16.049 --> 03:18.518
for his beloved horse now he has died?

03:18.585 --> 03:23.489
- Now that who has died?
- My fiancé. He was killed

03:23.557 --> 03:26.792
- in the stables last night.
- Miss Dawes, you must rest now.

03:26.860 --> 03:30.329
- Excuse us, gentlemen.
- Oh, will you take his horse?

03:30.397 --> 03:32.931
She's a real beauty.

03:32.999 --> 03:37.636
Well, apparently our stable boy wasn't
the only one to see the dead body.

03:37.703 --> 03:41.339
The question is, is Miss Dawes a witness,

03:41.407 --> 03:43.408
or the murderer?

03:53.461 --> 03:56.029
I'll be with you in
just a moment, Dr. Grace.

03:56.097 --> 03:57.698
Take your time, Detective.

03:57.765 --> 04:00.333
I don't believe our
corpse is going anywhere.

04:00.401 --> 04:02.102
Doctor.

04:02.169 --> 04:04.538
- Constable.
- Always a pleasure.

04:04.606 --> 04:06.072
What have you, George?

04:06.140 --> 04:08.141
Sir, the deceased fits

04:08.209 --> 04:11.110
the description of a Tobias
Pincher, who was seen last evening

04:11.177 --> 04:13.445
in the lounge of the
Imperial Hotel playing dice.

04:13.514 --> 04:16.115
- Very good.
- That's not all, sir.

04:16.182 --> 04:18.350
Mr. Pincher was indeed Miss Dawes' fiancé.

04:18.418 --> 04:20.786
Where is Miss Dawes now?

04:20.853 --> 04:24.856
- Close by, sir. She lives in a suite of rooms at the hotel.
- Good morning, Doctor.

04:24.924 --> 04:27.659
Good day, everyone.

04:27.727 --> 04:30.328
Dr. Ogden. Thank you for coming so quickly.

04:30.396 --> 04:35.734
Miss Dawes knows details about her
fiancé's murder only a witness could know.

04:35.801 --> 04:38.436
Or the murderer. What exactly
are her eccentricities?

04:38.504 --> 04:41.371
According to her nurse, she's
quite deranged and imagines things.

04:41.439 --> 04:43.541
That's more than eccentric, William.

04:43.608 --> 04:46.443
- That's why I need you to speak with her.
- Miss Dawes,

04:46.511 --> 04:48.512
My name is Julia Ogden.
I am a psychiatrist.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.550
Oh! How fascinating.
Isabel, serve our guests

04:52.617 --> 04:55.753
- a sherry before lunch.
- Th... that won't be necessary.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.921
Nothing like a sherry to calm the nerves.

04:57.988 --> 05:00.990
Please sit. We don't get many visitors here

05:01.058 --> 05:04.126
with the severity of the winter storms.

05:04.194 --> 05:06.395
I'm very sorry to hear about the loss

05:06.463 --> 05:08.397
of your fiancé, Miss Dawes.

05:08.465 --> 05:12.801
Thank you. We were to marry
in two weeks, you know.

05:12.869 --> 05:15.938
Now my wedding party will be a funeral.

05:16.005 --> 05:18.273
Had you known Mr. Pincher long?

05:18.340 --> 05:21.843
It's been almost six months, ma'am.

05:21.911 --> 05:26.748
Really? It seems as if
we just met yesterday.

05:26.851 --> 05:30.352
- Have you been with Miss Dawes all of that time?
- Longer, sir.

05:30.420 --> 05:32.722
I've worked for the
mistress nigh on seven years.

05:32.789 --> 05:34.757
And did you see her last night?

05:34.825 --> 05:37.426
I looked in on her at 11
o'clock. She was asleep.

05:37.494 --> 05:40.362
Is it possible that she could leave
her rooms without your knowledge?

05:40.430 --> 05:42.832
It's possible. She often wanders.

05:42.899 --> 05:46.034
The death of someone close to
you must be a terrible shock.

05:46.102 --> 05:49.638
Dead? Is someone dead?
Why didn't you tell me?

05:49.705 --> 05:52.907
A Tobias Pincher.

05:52.975 --> 05:55.910
Tobias is dead?

05:55.978 --> 05:57.979
I'm afraid so.

06:07.255 --> 06:10.190
The pitchfork has penetrated
quite deep. The prongs punctured

06:10.258 --> 06:12.726
his stomach and any
number of internal organs.

06:12.794 --> 06:14.862
- Thank you, Dr. Grace.
- Sir.

06:14.929 --> 06:18.497
Sir, I found a wallet in the
straw. I believe it's Mr. Pincher's.

06:18.565 --> 06:21.300
Right. We'll bring it to the stationhouse.

06:21.368 --> 06:24.256
What kind of man would
willingly marry a woman

06:24.257 --> 06:26.571
who's clearly not in
control of her faculties?

06:27.207 --> 06:31.110
I saw the pitchfork clearly.

06:31.178 --> 06:32.711
So you remember?

06:32.779 --> 06:35.881
Of course I remember.

06:40.386 --> 06:43.254
- It was a horrible way to die.
- And a terrible thing for you

06:43.322 --> 06:46.424
to witness, Miss Dawes. Were you nearby?

06:46.492 --> 06:48.193
Were you in the stable?

06:48.260 --> 06:49.860
I don't know.

06:49.928 --> 06:52.797
Perhaps it was just a
dream. Is that possible?

06:52.864 --> 06:54.732
It is.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.134
But perhaps something elicited the dream...

06:57.202 --> 07:00.571
something you saw or perhaps overheard.

07:00.638 --> 07:02.807
Do you recall any such event?

07:02.874 --> 07:06.609
You are so kind, Doctor.

07:06.677 --> 07:11.347
I feel so reassured in your presence.

07:11.415 --> 07:13.817
So, you don't recall any violent memory...

07:13.884 --> 07:15.484
a sight, or a sound?

07:15.552 --> 07:17.486
No...

07:17.554 --> 07:20.023
not at the moment.

07:20.091 --> 07:23.726
Miss Dawes, with your permission, I
would like to speak with you further.

07:23.793 --> 07:26.528
Would you be willing to come to my office?

07:26.596 --> 07:28.597
Doctor, how exciting.

07:28.664 --> 07:31.633
- Well, good. We can arrange f...
- Isabel!

07:31.701 --> 07:35.303
Isabel! Oh, this is most wonderful. Isabel,

07:35.371 --> 07:38.973
the doctor is arranging
our passage at last.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.543
Pack my warmest clothes for the journey.

07:41.611 --> 07:43.778
And make sure we have enough
blankets for the sleigh.

07:43.846 --> 07:47.482
- Yes, madam.
- I look forward to seeing you again.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.951
And I you. I can't thank you enough.

07:50.018 --> 07:52.454
I thought I would never see Moscow.

07:52.521 --> 07:56.357
I'll see you tomorrow, Miss Dawes.

08:02.063 --> 08:05.399
Does Miss Dawes often
create imaginary scenarios?

08:05.467 --> 08:07.934
I shouldn't like to speculate
on her condition, Doctor.

08:08.002 --> 08:10.202
As much as I appreciate
your loyalty, Miss Webster,

08:10.271 --> 08:13.873
any information you have could be
helpful in diagnosing her condition.

08:13.940 --> 08:16.509
- If you think it will help.
- I do.

08:16.577 --> 08:18.878
Her imaginings have been getting worse.

08:18.945 --> 08:21.814
She often thinks of herself
as a character from a story.

08:21.882 --> 08:23.683
Do they last long?

08:23.751 --> 08:25.817
She usually forgets them after a time.

08:25.885 --> 08:28.353
Moscow I've heard before... she
loves the Russian classics...

08:28.421 --> 08:32.457
but the stable, that's a new one.

08:32.525 --> 08:35.827
A pitchfork isn't a common murder weapon.

08:35.895 --> 08:38.496
But very convenient if you're
killing someone in a stable.

08:38.563 --> 08:40.030
Very good, sir.

08:40.099 --> 08:43.000
It also suggests that
the murder wasn't planned.

08:43.067 --> 08:45.436
- Any fingermarks?
- Only that of the stable boy's.

08:45.504 --> 08:48.506
- The murderer wore gloves.
- Sirs,

08:48.573 --> 08:51.909
I've discovered Tobias Pincher
had something of a chequered past.

08:51.976 --> 08:53.944
- How so?
- He's a known gambler, sir.

08:54.012 --> 08:56.001
He had debts from Kingston to Etobicoke.

08:56.181 --> 08:57.714
Miss Dawes, on the other hand,

08:57.782 --> 08:59.749
had inherited a substantial fortune.

08:59.817 --> 09:02.218
So he was marrying her money, not her.

09:02.286 --> 09:04.187
Sounds like she got lucky.

09:04.254 --> 09:06.889
I also found a man who was
with Mr. Pincher last night.

09:06.957 --> 09:09.759
We were engaged in a lively game of dice.

09:09.827 --> 09:12.762
- How lively?
- We'd all had a bit to drink.

09:12.830 --> 09:15.965
- Including Mr. Pincher?
- Oh, he was buying.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.267
Thought that was a good
way to run his cheat on us.

09:18.335 --> 09:20.937
What time did the game end?

09:21.004 --> 09:22.872
Around 11 o'clock.

09:22.940 --> 09:24.807
Was that the last time you saw him?

09:24.875 --> 09:26.976
I spotted him in the
courtyard not long after,

09:27.044 --> 09:29.111
in a heated conversation
with one of the players.

09:29.179 --> 09:31.079
Oh. Who was this?

09:31.147 --> 09:33.815
I don't know his name. He
was a guest at the hotel.

09:33.883 --> 09:35.516
A foreigner.

09:35.584 --> 09:38.353
"Smith, Green, Roberts, Jones,

09:38.420 --> 09:42.023
- Rodri-gueeze... Rodri-gwez?"
- Rodriguez.

09:42.091 --> 09:44.059
Well, sounds foreign to me, sir.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.727
- Mmm.
- Room 206.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.196
We'd like to speak to your
guest Mr. Carl Rodriguez,

09:49.264 --> 09:52.366
- please, in 206.
- Sorry, Detective. He just checked out.

09:52.433 --> 09:54.101
When was this?

09:54.169 --> 09:56.103
Just, uh, moments ago.

09:56.171 --> 09:58.305
George.

09:58.373 --> 10:00.975
I'll need the key to Room 206, please.

10:01.042 --> 10:04.810
- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, Darcy.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.154
The key, sir.

10:18.224 --> 10:20.325
Sir, the key.

10:22.795 --> 10:25.964
- Sir, the key.
- Hmm? Yes, thank you.

10:26.032 --> 10:27.665
You're welcome.

10:29.668 --> 10:32.737
Excuse me, sir. Did you
see anybody go in there?

10:32.805 --> 10:36.240
Why, uh, just a... a moment ago, sir.

10:36.308 --> 10:39.277
You in there! Toronto Constabulary!

10:46.651 --> 10:48.886
Ugh!

10:48.954 --> 10:51.187
You're coming with me.

10:51.255 --> 10:53.924
- I've done nothing wrong.
- Then why were you running?!

10:53.991 --> 10:58.795
You're pretty fast on
your feet there, Constable.

10:58.862 --> 11:00.763
Thanks, old timer.

11:02.733 --> 11:05.368
You are a visitor to Canada, Mr. Rodriguez?

11:05.436 --> 11:08.370
Yes. From Madrid. I'm here on business.

11:08.438 --> 11:09.939
Business?

11:10.006 --> 11:11.941
Yes. I export fine jewellery.

11:12.008 --> 11:15.010
I am here for meetings
with Mr. Henry Birks.

11:15.078 --> 11:17.012
What is this about?

11:17.080 --> 11:19.781
Where were you last night?

11:19.849 --> 11:22.283
Playing dice at the Imperial Hotel.

11:22.351 --> 11:26.487
If I may, how did you come by that bruise?

11:28.557 --> 11:31.392
I observed one of the players
cheating. After the match,

11:31.460 --> 11:34.895
I challenged him. This was his response.

11:34.964 --> 11:37.565
Which player was this?

11:37.632 --> 11:41.234
Mr. Pincher was his name, I believe.

11:41.302 --> 11:45.138
What time and where did
this altercation take place?

11:45.206 --> 11:50.743
Some time after 11 o'clock,
in the hotel courtyard.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.379
I see.

11:52.447 --> 11:55.714
Mr. Pincher was killed last night.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.517
I know nothing about that.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.190
These are your boots, yes?

12:04.257 --> 12:06.225
Which I found in your room.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.726
They match

12:07.794 --> 12:10.395
these footprint castings perfectly.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.630
How do you explain that?

12:14.633 --> 12:16.468
I cannot, Detective.

12:16.535 --> 12:20.171
Where were you last night after 11 o'clock?

12:20.239 --> 12:23.508
In my room. Alone.

12:23.575 --> 12:27.378
Do you have anything else you'd
like to tell me, Mr. Rodriguez?

12:31.549 --> 12:35.386
Well, then, perhaps a night in our
cells will help refresh your memory.

12:38.289 --> 12:41.258
Do you think I am mad, Doctor?

12:41.326 --> 12:42.758
No, I don't.

12:42.826 --> 12:45.428
Then why am I here?

12:45.496 --> 12:47.930
You are having distressing thoughts,

12:47.998 --> 12:50.766
and I might be able to help you.

12:50.834 --> 12:54.803
I'd like you to take yourself
into the stable dream again.

12:54.871 --> 12:56.772
The stable?

12:56.840 --> 12:58.874
Tell me what you saw.

13:01.444 --> 13:05.014
It was... dark in there.

13:05.081 --> 13:08.383
There were horses in the stable.

13:08.451 --> 13:11.754
A church bell rings midnight.

13:11.821 --> 13:14.122
- A church bell?
- Yes. It was loud enough

13:14.190 --> 13:17.659
to startle the horses.

13:17.726 --> 13:20.161
Then I saw a man.

13:20.228 --> 13:22.163
What did he look like?

13:22.230 --> 13:25.966
He was in the shadows; I couldn't see him.

13:29.071 --> 13:31.305
The pitchfork.

13:31.373 --> 13:33.441
Who is holding the pitchfork?

13:33.508 --> 13:37.277
Tobias was there. He looked terrified.

13:40.381 --> 13:42.248
Oh, my God.

13:42.316 --> 13:45.185
What is it, Miss Dawes?

13:47.321 --> 13:50.123
It was me.

13:50.191 --> 13:53.559
Oh, my God, I killed him.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.742
Did you love your fiancé, Miss Dawes?

14:02.810 --> 14:06.245
I think I did.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.148
Why would you want to harm him?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.150
What do you mean?

14:11.218 --> 14:14.285
I'm sorry, I... I must leave.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.522
I must prepare the house for winter.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.425
Isabel. Where's Isabel? Oh, there you are.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.801
- We have to go.
- Is everything all right?

14:21.802 --> 14:23.258
You can take her home now.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.331
But you're not to let
her out of your sight.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.333
Of course. We will be home soon, madam.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.335
Don't you worry.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.337
Can you help her, Doctor?

14:33.405 --> 14:35.339
I'm not sure.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.042
- But you will see her tomorrow?
- Yes,

14:38.109 --> 14:39.844
yes, of course.

14:39.912 --> 14:42.513
Let us go, madam.

14:42.581 --> 14:46.917
Yes. We shouldn't keep
the woodcutters waiting.

14:59.163 --> 15:01.129
Sleep well?

15:01.197 --> 15:03.165
I've been in worse places.

15:03.232 --> 15:05.534
Detective, I have told you all I know.

15:05.602 --> 15:08.170
I had an argument with Mr. Pincher.

15:08.237 --> 15:10.806
Then I left and returned to my room.

15:10.874 --> 15:14.176
Mr. Rodriguez, I now have evidence
that you were inside the stables.

15:14.243 --> 15:15.877
I was not.

15:15.945 --> 15:19.547
I suggest you start
telling the truth, sunshine.

15:19.615 --> 15:22.951
George, could you please
fetch my fingermark kit?

15:23.018 --> 15:24.518
Sir.

15:32.426 --> 15:35.796
Well, that's part of the
job I must say I don't miss.

15:35.863 --> 15:38.498
I consider it a form of callisthenics.

15:38.566 --> 15:40.300
What did you want to see?

15:40.367 --> 15:41.935
The wounds.

15:42.003 --> 15:44.805
- These were made by a pitchfork?
- Yes.

15:44.872 --> 15:48.507
- How deep are they?
- Four-and-an-eighth inches.

15:48.575 --> 15:50.109
Dr. Ogden?

15:50.176 --> 15:52.111
I'm trying to determine

15:52.178 --> 15:54.480
if this blow could have
been struck by a woman...

15:54.547 --> 15:57.516
- a somewhat frail woman.
- If she were determined enough.

15:57.584 --> 16:00.086
Yes. Thank you.

16:00.153 --> 16:02.421
But it probably wasn't a woman.

16:02.489 --> 16:06.290
Constable Crabtree told me they
arrested a likely culprit yesterday.

16:07.358 --> 16:11.505
Tobias Pincher's wallet.
And your fingermarks were

16:11.506 --> 16:15.867
found on it. How do you explain that.

16:15.935 --> 16:17.902
I can't.

16:17.970 --> 16:21.105
You had a fight with the victim,

16:21.172 --> 16:25.375
your footprints were found near his body,
and now your fingermarks on his wallet.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.278
Are you yet ready to tell
me what really happened?

16:31.850 --> 16:34.451
I followed Pincher in the stable.

16:34.519 --> 16:36.819
I accused him of cheating at dice.

16:36.887 --> 16:39.822
He handed me his wallet,
telling me to take the money.

16:39.890 --> 16:42.324
That is why you have found my fingermarks.

16:42.392 --> 16:47.130
I held his wallet, but I did not kill him.

16:47.197 --> 16:49.465
May I go now?

16:51.535 --> 16:54.202
You wanted to talk to me?

16:54.270 --> 16:57.639
Yes. Um, Julia, it's a
matter of some delicacy.

16:57.707 --> 16:59.274
Go ahead.

16:59.341 --> 17:01.810
While I was at the Imperial Hotel,

17:01.878 --> 17:05.246
I saw Darcy. He was with a woman.

17:05.314 --> 17:08.582
Oh. Perhaps his sister?

17:08.650 --> 17:10.317
She visits often.

17:10.385 --> 17:12.452
I don't think it was his sister, Julia.

17:12.487 --> 17:14.555
They were coming down from the rooms.

17:14.622 --> 17:16.924
Ah.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.675
So, Darcy has a lady friend.

17:19.161 --> 17:20.946
Not that it makes any difference.

17:21.063 --> 17:22.469
Of course it makes a difference.

17:22.470 --> 17:26.750
No. In order to petition against him
I have to prove adultery and cruelty.

17:26.751 --> 17:27.348
You know this.

17:27.348 --> 17:29.960
Yes, I know this, but surely
now you can appeal to him.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.451
- He can't possibly refuse you.
- He won't listen!

17:32.518 --> 17:34.252
He's determined to punish me.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.689
- Julia, you can't ignore this.
- I don't intend to.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.624
I will speak to Darcy when I'm ready.

17:43.628 --> 17:46.263
I hear you have a suspect
in the stable case.

17:46.331 --> 17:47.898
Yes, I do.

17:47.966 --> 17:51.068
What did you learn from your
interview with Miss Dawes?

17:51.135 --> 17:53.904
Only that she's prone to the fantastical.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.272
Perhaps I should interview her myself.

17:56.340 --> 17:59.743
I don't think so, William.
She's... she's quite delusional.

17:59.810 --> 18:02.278
Julia, she's a potential
witness to a murder.

18:02.346 --> 18:04.714
I need to speak with her.

18:10.521 --> 18:13.822
I'd like to sit in on your
interview, as her doctor, William.

18:13.890 --> 18:16.124
Has she something to hide?

18:20.363 --> 18:23.399
Miss Webster, if you
could please wait outside?

18:23.466 --> 18:26.802
- I accompany Miss Dawes everywhere.
- Oh, it's all right, Isabel.

18:26.870 --> 18:29.670
I'm more than happy to
talk to the detective.

18:37.212 --> 18:38.679
Detective,

18:38.747 --> 18:41.982
has anyone ever told you
you're a handsome man?

18:45.453 --> 18:47.220
Uh...

18:47.288 --> 18:49.923
We should be in there, you know.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.859
- She's not in her right mind.
- Miss Dawes,

18:52.927 --> 18:57.096
how did you find out your
fiancé had been killed?

18:57.164 --> 18:59.799
Surely the doctor told you, Detective.

18:59.866 --> 19:03.101
- Told me what?
- It was me.

19:03.169 --> 19:04.737
I killed him.

19:04.805 --> 19:06.672
It was you?

19:06.740 --> 19:10.476
I took the pitchfork and stabbed him.

19:11.344 --> 19:12.895
You stabbed him?

19:12.896 --> 19:16.548
Mr. Rodriguez. Make sure
you don't leave Toronto, sir.

19:16.615 --> 19:18.382
We'll have men watching you.

19:18.451 --> 19:21.185
- Are you quite sure?
- I had no choice.

19:21.253 --> 19:24.489
He had to be stopped.
Tobias was going to kill him.

19:24.607 --> 19:27.041
Was going to kill whom?

19:29.011 --> 19:30.512
Tristan.

19:30.579 --> 19:32.579
Tristan?

19:32.647 --> 19:34.715
Tristan Clavelle.

19:39.353 --> 19:41.688
Miss Dawes... um,

19:41.756 --> 19:43.690
if someone

19:43.758 --> 19:46.860
had stolen money from you,

19:46.928 --> 19:49.862
in your room, would it
be right to kill them?

19:49.930 --> 19:51.664
Of course not.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.000
And if they had hurt you?

19:54.067 --> 19:56.135
Of course not.

19:59.105 --> 20:01.541
You should have told
me the moment you heard.

20:01.608 --> 20:03.675
She's my patient, William. I don't disclose

20:03.743 --> 20:06.244
what I'm told in confidence,
and I do not work for you.

20:06.311 --> 20:09.213
- Be that as it may, we have a...
- What about the man you arrested?

20:09.281 --> 20:12.482
He was in the stables, but I have
no evidence he murdered Pincher.

20:12.551 --> 20:14.518
What evidence do you
have against Miss Dawes?

20:14.586 --> 20:16.486
Well I now have a confession!

20:16.555 --> 20:18.556
From someone not in her right mind!

20:18.623 --> 20:20.524
She seems rational enough to me.

20:20.592 --> 20:22.492
Oh, well, now you're a psychiatrist?

20:22.561 --> 20:23.994
Julia, please.

20:24.062 --> 20:26.196
She confessed to murder
while protecting someone

20:26.264 --> 20:28.998
she's calling Tristan,
clearly someone she imagined!

20:29.066 --> 20:30.700
I haven't charged her yet,

20:30.768 --> 20:33.803
but she is a suspect.
You should have told me.

20:33.871 --> 20:36.773
- Are you sure she's your suspect, Murdoch?
- Yes.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.275
Well, that's a shame,
considering that Spanish fellow,

20:39.342 --> 20:43.779
Rodriguez, has just confessed to
the murder of one Tobias Pincher.

20:47.716 --> 20:49.217
Well, aren't I a lucky sod,

20:49.285 --> 20:51.485
working with a detective
who's so good that he's got

20:51.553 --> 20:54.622
two different people
confessing to the same murder?

20:54.690 --> 20:56.324
So, which one did it?

20:56.391 --> 20:58.525
Miss Dawes is convinced she did it.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.027
What do you think?

21:00.094 --> 21:02.796
She described the murder
weapon, a pitchfork.

21:02.864 --> 21:04.798
How did she come by that knowledge?

21:04.866 --> 21:07.467
- Then we charge her.
- You can't do that.

21:07.535 --> 21:11.004
She may have an illness that causes
her to imagine things that aren't there.

21:11.072 --> 21:13.973
- She's mixed up, confused.
- So is Margaret's mother,

21:14.041 --> 21:17.388
but that doesn't mean she's fit
for the madhouse. Although...

21:17.389 --> 21:19.560
You can't prosecute a sick woman.

21:16.585 --> 21:21.917
All she is suffering from is old age.

21:21.934 --> 21:23.515
That's not enough to call her crazy.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.686
Detective Murdoch, may I speak
with Miss Dawes in your office?

21:27.754 --> 21:29.420
Certainly.

21:31.490 --> 21:36.294
Miss Dawes, who is this Tristan
you told Detective Murdoch about?

21:36.362 --> 21:38.296
Can you keep a secret?

21:38.364 --> 21:40.665
I am a psychiatrist.

21:40.733 --> 21:43.168
He's my lover.

21:43.236 --> 21:45.569
I had to protect him, don't you see?

21:45.636 --> 21:47.404
Yes.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.706
Oh, I knew you would understand.

21:49.774 --> 21:53.677
You have a love as well,
don't you? A secret one.

21:53.745 --> 21:56.847
I do.

21:56.915 --> 21:59.850
And you would do anything
to save him, to be with him?

21:59.918 --> 22:02.986
Where is he now, Miss
Dawes? Where is Tristan?

22:03.053 --> 22:05.654
Safe, I hope.

22:05.722 --> 22:08.224
Miss Dawes?

22:08.292 --> 22:11.460
Please, I... I just want to go home.

22:11.528 --> 22:16.032
Where's Isabel? I need her to take me home.

22:16.100 --> 22:20.135
I followed Mr. Pincher into the stable.

22:20.203 --> 22:23.838
He handed me his wallet,
telling me to take the money.

22:23.907 --> 22:27.209
The insult enraged me.

22:27.277 --> 22:29.511
I threw it to the ground.

22:29.578 --> 22:31.947
That's when Pincher came at me.

22:32.015 --> 22:35.082
He attacked you?

22:35.150 --> 22:38.953
I reached for something to defend myself.

22:39.021 --> 22:41.122
Then I stabbed him.

22:41.189 --> 22:42.623
With what?

22:42.690 --> 22:45.026
A pitchfork.

22:45.093 --> 22:47.528
I stabbed him with a pitchfork.

22:47.595 --> 22:51.631
Mr. Rodriguez, why are
you telling me this now?

22:51.698 --> 22:54.734
My conscience demanded it.

22:54.802 --> 22:59.172
Was there anyone else in
the stables at the time?

22:59.240 --> 23:02.742
No. Only me.

23:05.011 --> 23:07.646
May I take Miss Dawes home now?

23:07.713 --> 23:09.481
Inspector?

23:09.549 --> 23:13.218
- Not bloody likely.
- What if I keep her in my care?

23:13.286 --> 23:15.958
- And she'll stay in the asylum?
- You have my word.

23:15.959 --> 23:16.959
Fair enough.

23:17.013 --> 23:19.014
It's the best I can do.

23:19.081 --> 23:21.149
Carry on.

23:21.217 --> 23:23.484
Tristan! Thank God you're safe.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.820
Do you know this woman?

23:25.888 --> 23:29.089
- No, I don't.
- Tristan.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.492
Take me to the cells.

23:36.464 --> 23:37.931
Miss Dawes,

23:37.999 --> 23:40.734
it's time to go now.

23:40.801 --> 23:43.302
Oh, don't fret, Isabel.

23:43.370 --> 23:46.239
I will be taken care of by the nice doctor.

23:46.306 --> 23:48.041
You can visit me.

23:49.977 --> 23:51.678
Bring the sherry.

24:04.624 --> 24:07.059
Did you find what you were looking for,

24:07.126 --> 24:09.627
- Dr. Ogden?
- I'm afraid not.

24:09.695 --> 24:13.230
It's curious, most dementia patients
slide inexorably into oblivion,

24:13.298 --> 24:17.869
but few have delusions of
such consistency and detail.

24:17.937 --> 24:21.238
There is a doctor in Boston
who believes Parkinson's disease

24:21.306 --> 24:24.275
- could be a cause of dementia.
- Yes, I thought of that,

24:24.342 --> 24:27.644
but Miss Dawes exhibits none of the
physical characteristics of Parkinson's.

24:27.712 --> 24:30.213
Her account of the murder is quite lucid,

24:30.281 --> 24:32.248
- filled with detail.
- In what way?

24:32.316 --> 24:35.418
She recalls hearing church
bells sound at midnight,

24:35.486 --> 24:39.456
and she is convinced that a man
named Tristan was in the stable.

24:39.523 --> 24:41.757
And there's no proof of either.

24:41.825 --> 24:44.460
I'm convinced she's
suffering from a dementia

24:44.527 --> 24:47.997
that creates elaborate
delusions, even hallucinations.

24:48.065 --> 24:50.466
And there's no proof of a church bell?

24:50.533 --> 24:53.903
The closest church to
the hotel is St. Francis,

24:53.971 --> 24:55.972
and that clock hasn't worked in years.

24:56.039 --> 24:57.839
Are you sure?

25:00.576 --> 25:03.344
And Dr. Garland has taken a mistress?

25:03.412 --> 25:05.179
It appears so.

25:05.247 --> 25:07.816
But it doesn't help your cause, does it?

25:07.883 --> 25:10.819
- Not in the slightest.
- You'd think in this modern age

25:10.886 --> 25:13.354
Dr. Garland's actions would mean something.

25:13.422 --> 25:15.089
I'm afraid not, Emily.

25:15.156 --> 25:18.025
I think you and Detective
Murdoch should just live in sin.

25:18.093 --> 25:19.760
Ah, there you are.

25:19.828 --> 25:23.396
I must say, it is a pleasure
to see two such lovely ladies

25:23.464 --> 25:26.133
taking an interest in our humble church.

25:28.269 --> 25:30.236
Well, the clock hasn't worked in years.

25:30.303 --> 25:32.739
- We try to raise funds...
- So it couldn't have

25:32.806 --> 25:36.442
- sounded two nights ago?
- No. The last time a bell sounded in this church was

25:36.510 --> 25:40.579
decades ago. Now, this was painted in 1830.

25:40.648 --> 25:43.449
That's the original church.
It was destroyed by fire.

25:43.517 --> 25:47.185
The bell in that one rang
true and strong. Indeed.

25:47.253 --> 25:50.789
A very fine painting.

25:50.857 --> 25:55.293
- Tristan Clavelle?
- A parishioner who dabbled as a painter.

25:55.361 --> 25:58.296
When did this church burn down?

25:58.364 --> 26:00.331
Eighteen thirty-two.

26:00.399 --> 26:02.199
A sad day that was.

26:06.805 --> 26:09.239
- Goodbye.
- Good day.

26:09.307 --> 26:11.241
What is it?

26:11.309 --> 26:13.911
Miss Dawes said she killed
Mr. Pincher because he was

26:13.979 --> 26:17.414
attacking a man named Tristan,
a man she said was her lover.

26:17.482 --> 26:19.983
But this Tristan would have
died before she was even born.

26:20.051 --> 26:23.319
I know. But I think somewhere in her brain

26:23.387 --> 26:25.354
there's a connection between
the past and the present.

26:25.422 --> 26:27.356
We need to know more about him.

26:27.424 --> 26:29.592
I have a frndnd who owns an art gallery.

26:29.660 --> 26:31.661
He is familiar with the works
of most Toronto painters.

26:31.729 --> 26:33.229
Shall we?

26:43.973 --> 26:45.874
Really?

26:47.911 --> 26:49.477
Dr. Garland.

26:49.545 --> 26:51.679
- A moment of your time?
- Certainly not.

26:51.747 --> 26:53.848
I need to speak with you.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.440
I'll get straight to the point.

26:56.468 --> 26:58.551
I want you to let Julia go.

26:58.619 --> 27:00.754
You should have married
her when you had the chance.

27:00.788 --> 27:04.457
- Do the right thing. Release her.
- For you?

27:04.525 --> 27:06.993
- That will never happen.
- Darcy,

27:07.061 --> 27:10.396
- is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

27:10.464 --> 27:12.332
I'll be along presently.

27:15.635 --> 27:20.339
- Be reasonable, man. Considering your actions...
- Julia agreed to be my wife

27:20.406 --> 27:22.441
till death do us part.
I won't taint my standing

27:22.508 --> 27:24.710
in the community because
she's had a change of heart.

27:24.778 --> 27:28.247
Now, if she wants to dally
with you, I won't stop her.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.782
Divorce her, if only to preserve her name.

27:32.885 --> 27:37.889
If she's going to act like a whore,
she might as well be labelled as such.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.658
- Ugh!
- Oh, my goodness!

27:40.726 --> 27:44.062
- Darcy!
- Is he all right?

27:44.130 --> 27:46.997
- He just came up and hit him!
- Get out of the way.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.099
Darcy, are you all right?

27:55.907 --> 27:59.342
Tristan Clavelle was known for his
paintings of early Toronto landmarks.

27:59.410 --> 28:03.012
Interesting... do you know
anything more about him.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.915
He dabbled in portraiture
with little critical success.

28:05.983 --> 28:08.751
He died in 1845.

28:11.521 --> 28:14.090
That's him. A self-portrait.

28:14.158 --> 28:16.458
Hm. He's quite good-looking.

28:16.526 --> 28:20.492
He looks like Carl Rodriguez.

28:20.595 --> 28:21.863
As you see, Mr. Rodriguez,

28:21.931 --> 28:25.066
you bear an uncanny resemblance
to this Toronto painter.

28:25.250 --> 28:28.352
Do you have any ancestors
who used to lived here?

28:28.420 --> 28:32.223
None at all. We are Catalan
for several generations.

28:32.291 --> 28:36.126
When Miss Dawes saw you,
she called you Tristan,

28:36.193 --> 28:37.660
did she not?

28:37.728 --> 28:41.031
I do not know who she is.
She is clearly mistaken.

28:41.098 --> 28:44.028
Could she be imagining herself
in a story with Tristan,

28:44.029 --> 28:45.242
and she thinks you're him?

28:45.243 --> 28:47.203
She knows you've
been taken into custody

28:47.271 --> 28:49.204
for the murder of Tobias Pincher.

28:49.272 --> 28:51.941
A crime to which I have already confessed.

28:52.008 --> 28:54.009
Is it possible

28:54.077 --> 28:56.979
she's taking the blame for the
murder in order to spare you?

28:57.047 --> 28:59.781
I have told you before.

28:59.849 --> 29:02.851
I do not know her, Detective.

29:02.919 --> 29:05.353
Could they have killed Pincher together?

29:05.421 --> 29:07.721
Given her condition, it's conceivable

29:07.789 --> 29:10.491
that he could have convinced
her that she did it.

29:10.559 --> 29:13.227
But still, the resemblance.

29:13.295 --> 29:15.263
- George.
- Sir?

29:15.331 --> 29:17.332
City records, if you would. I need you

29:17.399 --> 29:20.734
to find out everything you can about
a painter named Tristan Clavelle.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.269
Right away, sir.

29:22.337 --> 29:24.404
Murdoch! I just took a complaint

29:24.472 --> 29:27.874
from Dr. Darcy Gar... land. Sir.

29:27.942 --> 29:31.078
I told him not to bother, of course.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.846
William?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.754
You hit him?

29:41.822 --> 29:43.422
I lost my composure.

29:43.491 --> 29:46.860
I told you to stay out of this. Why?

29:46.927 --> 29:50.363
Because he's doing you wrong!
Because he should let you go!

29:50.430 --> 29:53.199
- I told you I would handle it!
- But you didn't!

29:53.266 --> 29:56.368
And you thought that he would listen
to the high and mighty William Murdoch!

29:56.435 --> 29:57.440
Julia.

29:57.441 --> 30:00.656
You were to stay out of this!
He'll never allow a divorce now!

30:00.840 --> 30:02.614
We wouldn't have to worry about a divorce

30:02.615 --> 30:04.712
if you hadn't married
him in the first place!

30:06.379 --> 30:08.580
You could have stopped me.

30:08.648 --> 30:11.949
I couldn't. You know that. I had no choice!

30:12.017 --> 30:15.953
You had a choice. You could
have chosen me and you didn't!

31:07.260 --> 31:08.726
Sir!

31:08.794 --> 31:12.797
It's not about Tristan Clavelle, but...

31:12.865 --> 31:14.832
Then what is it, George?

31:14.899 --> 31:17.762
Sir, it's from the Colonial
Advocate September 1830.

31:17.768 --> 31:23.807
It's a report on a trial for a
murder in a stable with a pitchfork.

31:23.875 --> 31:27.678
And the murderess... Sir,
you've got to see this.

31:31.115 --> 31:35.418
She pleaded guilty to killing her fiancé.

31:37.322 --> 31:38.640
And what do you want?

31:40.157 --> 31:41.791
An explanation.

31:41.859 --> 31:44.461
Do you know who she is, Mr. Rodriguez?

31:47.498 --> 31:49.732
You have confessed to a murder.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.934
Miss Dawes has confessed to the same crime.

31:52.002 --> 31:55.337
An answer please, sir, or I
will have choice but to put her

31:55.405 --> 31:57.874
- at the end of a noose.
- No!

32:02.411 --> 32:04.646
She is my soulmate.

32:13.422 --> 32:15.123
Open it.

32:17.092 --> 32:20.360
Jane Gleat and Tristan Clavelle.

32:20.428 --> 32:22.863
How did you come by this locket?

32:22.931 --> 32:24.632
Quite by chance...

32:24.699 --> 32:27.535
or so I thought.

32:27.602 --> 32:30.871
I sought out the Toronto
silversmith from his mark.

32:30.939 --> 32:32.840
He was dead,

32:32.908 --> 32:36.242
but his son told me the story
of the star-crossed lovers.

32:36.309 --> 32:39.478
You saw the resemblance and
felt some sort of kinship?

32:39.547 --> 32:41.614
More than that.

32:41.780 --> 32:45.215
I knew I had been Tristan
Clavelle years ago.

32:45.283 --> 32:47.752
What was the lovers' story?

32:49.754 --> 32:51.821
Jane was promised to be married,

32:51.889 --> 32:54.124
but was in love with Tristan.

32:56.027 --> 32:59.095
On the night they were to elope,

32:59.163 --> 33:02.598
Jane's fiancé confronted Tristan.

33:02.667 --> 33:05.768
Jane killed to save her lover's life.

33:05.835 --> 33:10.906
As I listened, every word rang true.

33:10.974 --> 33:13.776
As if I had lived it.

33:13.843 --> 33:17.146
And what does this have to do
with the murder of Mr. Pincher?

33:17.213 --> 33:20.248
I was about to leave Toronto

33:20.316 --> 33:23.651
when quite by chance I
saw a woman on King St.

33:23.719 --> 33:26.420
Who looked like Jane Gleat.

33:26.488 --> 33:29.423
It was Felicity Dawes.
A striking resemblance.

33:29.491 --> 33:31.826
No, more.

33:31.894 --> 33:35.262
Much more than resemblance.

33:35.330 --> 33:37.764
The moment our eyes met,

33:37.832 --> 33:41.702
I... I knew it was her.

33:43.705 --> 33:46.673
She was my Jane.

33:48.642 --> 33:51.344
You told her the story.

33:51.412 --> 33:54.113
Oh, yes.

33:54.181 --> 33:57.149
That we were fated to be together.

33:57.217 --> 34:01.619
She went to the gallows saving
my life all those years ago.

34:01.687 --> 34:04.555
And this is my turn to repay her.

34:07.026 --> 34:09.159
So, Carl Rodriguez and Felicity Dawes think

34:09.228 --> 34:11.495
that they are Tristan
Clavelle and Jane Gleat?

34:11.563 --> 34:14.799
- According to Mr. Rodriguez, yes.
- Lovers through the ages.

34:14.867 --> 34:16.634
It's a romantic notion, sirs.

34:16.702 --> 34:21.170
- It's a load of bollocks.
- Sir, it's reincarnation, pure and simple.

34:21.239 --> 34:24.608
I mean, perhaps Miss Dawes is
not imagining she is Jane Gleat;

34:24.675 --> 34:27.510
perhaps she IS the
reincarnation of Jane Gleat.

34:27.578 --> 34:30.480
I know what reincarnation is.
It's a load of Eastern bollocks.

34:30.547 --> 34:34.016
Sir, it would explain her recollection of
the crime, it would explain the physical

34:34.083 --> 34:35.187
similarity between the two women.

34:35.196 --> 34:37.687
George, we don't need
the fantastical right now.

34:37.723 --> 34:39.764
Sirs, I think you're
both being closed-minded.

34:39.766 --> 34:41.362
Who is to say that this isn't true?

34:42.059 --> 34:45.161
- We're living in the 20th bloody century, Crabtree.
- We are now, sir,

34:45.228 --> 34:47.196
but who's to say that we
didn't live in past centuries?

34:47.264 --> 34:51.099
Who's to say that you didn't
used to be some great king or lord

34:51.167 --> 34:53.568
or some such? And what the hell were you?

34:53.636 --> 34:56.404
A bloody fruit fly?

34:56.472 --> 34:58.373
And Detective Murdoch hit him?

34:58.440 --> 35:00.809
Apparently right in the middle of King St.

35:00.877 --> 35:03.311
- It was completely inappropriate.
- I never would have thought

35:03.379 --> 35:05.579
Detective Murdoch had it in him.

35:05.647 --> 35:07.915
You must admit, Dr. Ogden,

35:07.983 --> 35:09.616
it is highly romantic.

35:09.684 --> 35:12.486
And stupid. I'm trying to convince Darcy

35:12.553 --> 35:14.889
to grant me a divorce. This doesn't help.

35:14.956 --> 35:17.424
Emily, listen to this.

35:17.492 --> 35:20.960
"The patient exhibits movement
from lucidity to confusion

35:21.028 --> 35:23.863
without the pattern often
associated with senile dementia."

35:23.931 --> 35:26.266
That sounds much like Felicity Dawes.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.801
Who is the researcher?

35:27.868 --> 35:29.969
Dr. Alois Alzheimer.

35:30.037 --> 35:32.105
Some of the symptoms he's studying match,

35:32.173 --> 35:34.140
but it doesn't explain the delusions.

35:34.208 --> 35:36.475
Perhaps she has another form of dementia.

35:36.543 --> 35:40.478
I believe she does.
Unfortunately as yet unnamed.

35:40.546 --> 35:42.514
I can't use any of this in her defence.

35:42.581 --> 35:44.983
Dr. Ogden.

35:45.051 --> 35:47.119
Dr. Grace.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.787
I should go.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.856
Thank you for you help,

35:50.924 --> 35:52.490
Dr. Grace.

35:55.627 --> 35:57.528
- Julia...
- Please, William.

35:57.595 --> 35:59.831
Not now.

35:59.898 --> 36:03.600
I need to speak to your patient.

36:03.668 --> 36:07.305
If you must, but this time
I insist on being present.

36:07.372 --> 36:09.572
Tristan was so talented.

36:09.640 --> 36:12.642
He painted a portrait of me once.

36:12.710 --> 36:15.178
But your fiancé found out about him.

36:15.246 --> 36:17.613
He was going to kill
Tristan. I had no choice.

36:17.681 --> 36:20.317
You see that, don't you?

36:20.384 --> 36:22.418
I do.

36:25.056 --> 36:28.591
The handsome detective.
He is your secret love.

36:28.659 --> 36:31.861
He is the one.

36:34.832 --> 36:38.801
Am I leaving now? I'm
ready for the journey,

36:38.869 --> 36:41.237
long and arduous though it may be.

36:41.304 --> 36:43.972
I'm not arresting you, Miss Dawes.

36:44.039 --> 36:46.140
Take me, I beg you.

36:46.208 --> 36:48.209
I am the murderer.

36:50.713 --> 36:54.082
What happened the night
of Mr. Pincher's murder?

36:57.652 --> 37:00.721
Felicity and I intended
to run away together.

37:00.789 --> 37:03.724
And yet you knew she wasn't well.

37:03.792 --> 37:07.127
When you find your soulmate, Doctor,

37:07.195 --> 37:10.464
there is no obstacle too great.

37:12.467 --> 37:15.001
You planned to meet at the stables?

37:15.068 --> 37:17.604
Like Jane and Tristan.

37:17.671 --> 37:21.140
To finish the journey they had begun.

37:21.208 --> 37:24.377
When I arrived, Mr. Pincher was there.

37:24.445 --> 37:28.314
He thought I was a threat to him
getting his hands on her money.

37:28.382 --> 37:30.181
He came

37:30.249 --> 37:32.751
for me. I picked up the pitchfork.

37:34.788 --> 37:37.923
I believe Mr. Pincher was
already dead when you arrived,

37:37.990 --> 37:42.093
Mr. Rodriguez, and you planted
the evidence to point to yourself.

37:42.161 --> 37:46.363
You are protecting Miss Dawes. Why?

37:46.432 --> 37:51.101
In a past life, she protected me.

37:51.169 --> 37:54.171
I am paying back that debt.

37:54.239 --> 37:57.575
I am content to hang,

37:57.643 --> 38:00.110
as she died for me.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.813
Do you really believe all of this?

38:04.816 --> 38:06.750
What faith do you follow?

38:06.818 --> 38:08.552
Roman Catholic.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.421
Ah. So...

38:11.489 --> 38:14.123
you believe a man,

38:14.191 --> 38:17.226
a man no less than the son of God,

38:17.294 --> 38:21.096
a man of virgin birth, died,

38:21.164 --> 38:23.098
and then three days later

38:23.166 --> 38:25.835
rose from the dead to walk among us.

38:27.838 --> 38:31.674
Yet I do not mock you.

38:34.610 --> 38:37.445
I have two people willing to
take the blame for a crime,

38:37.513 --> 38:39.614
and no way of knowing which
one is telling the truth.

38:39.682 --> 38:41.148
Dr. Ogden?

38:41.216 --> 38:43.518
Felicity Dawes did confess,

38:43.586 --> 38:47.154
but to a murder she imagines
she committed 70 years ago.

38:47.222 --> 38:48.388
Forget all the mumbo jumbo nonsense.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.859
Who stands to make a lot of money
if Miss Dawes sees the noose?

38:51.926 --> 38:54.561
As her future husband,
that would be Mr. Pincher.

38:54.629 --> 38:56.763
And someone took him out of the picture.

38:56.831 --> 38:58.360
Now, who stood to get
the most out of Miss Dawes

38:58.361 --> 39:00.000
before Pincher appeared on the scene?

39:00.368 --> 39:02.569
Follow the money.

39:02.637 --> 39:05.405
Finally, Murdoch. You're
learning something from me.

39:07.407 --> 39:09.642
It wasn't Miss Dawes' fault, Detective.

39:09.710 --> 39:12.111
That terrible man, Rodriguez,

39:12.178 --> 39:14.380
he poisoned her mind against Mr. Pincher.

39:14.447 --> 39:16.582
He was little more than a confidence man,

39:16.650 --> 39:19.519
telling her these silly
tales... how they were lovers

39:19.586 --> 39:22.687
from a past life.

39:22.755 --> 39:25.356
You see, my love?

39:25.424 --> 39:29.528
I am Tristan, and you are my Jane.

39:29.595 --> 39:33.698
And we are destined to be
together through all time.

39:35.701 --> 39:37.801
You've been with Miss
Dawes for seven years, now?

39:37.869 --> 39:39.403
Yes.

39:39.470 --> 39:41.639
Those must have been hard years.

39:41.706 --> 39:43.841
After all, you were more than a nurse

39:43.909 --> 39:47.144
to her; you were a companion, a confidante.

39:47.211 --> 39:49.179
It must have been a terrible strain

39:49.247 --> 39:51.949
when Miss Dawes became
more and more forgetful.

39:52.017 --> 39:55.384
We're put on this world for duty, sir.

39:55.452 --> 39:57.520
I didn't shirk mine.

39:57.588 --> 40:01.791
But surely you expected some
sort of reward for your troubles?

40:01.859 --> 40:06.429
Isn't it true that if Miss
Dawes were to have passed,

40:06.496 --> 40:08.865
you would have been her beneficiary?

40:08.933 --> 40:12.333
- She is a generous woman...
- Or at least

40:12.401 --> 40:14.603
you would have been her beneficiary

40:14.671 --> 40:18.640
until Tobias Pincher came on the
scene, and then that all changed.

40:20.610 --> 40:22.778
Detective Murdoch, I've had enough.

40:22.845 --> 40:25.547
I am going to see if my mistress needs me.

40:25.614 --> 40:27.648
Miss Webster,

40:27.716 --> 40:29.717
may I see your gloves?

40:52.940 --> 40:55.742
There are wood fragments

40:55.810 --> 40:58.677
in the weave of this glove, Miss Webster.

40:58.745 --> 41:01.514
I wonder how they got there.

41:08.886 --> 41:10.988
Sir, the wood fragments are a match.

41:11.056 --> 41:14.791
Ah, thank you, George, but she's confessed.

41:14.859 --> 41:17.360
Three confessions to a single murder?

41:17.428 --> 41:19.562
Sir, this must be something of a record.

41:19.629 --> 41:21.730
Yes, well, this one will stick.

41:21.798 --> 41:24.434
Isabel Webster knew that Mr. Rodriguez

41:24.501 --> 41:27.536
and Miss Dawes believed they
were reliving a past life.

41:27.604 --> 41:30.506
She told Mr. Pincher of their
plans to elope that night,

41:30.574 --> 41:33.175
knowing full well that
he would confront them.

41:33.242 --> 41:35.143
And then she killed Mr.
Pincher in the stable...

41:35.211 --> 41:38.046
the same way Jane Gleat killed her fiancé.

41:38.114 --> 41:40.311
Isabel then told her
mistress about the murder,

41:40.312 --> 41:42.206
left the rest to her imagination.

41:42.318 --> 41:45.553
It was only a matter of time
before Miss Dawes confessed herself.

41:45.621 --> 41:48.156
What with Miss Dawes and Mr.
Pincher gone, Isabel Webster

41:48.224 --> 41:50.458
could've finally said goodbye
to cleaning chamber pots.

41:50.526 --> 41:53.094
Well put, George.

41:53.161 --> 41:57.632
I intend to care for Felicity now.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.501
You know there is no cure.

42:00.068 --> 42:03.471
- It is a fate I embrace.
- Tristan!

42:03.539 --> 42:05.305
My love.

42:05.373 --> 42:08.842
- She calls you Tristan.
- Yes.

42:08.910 --> 42:11.265
She often talks of the past.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.548
She remembers every detail you told
her... the stable and the pitchfork,

42:14.616 --> 42:16.783
the church bell chiming at midnight.

42:16.851 --> 42:22.188
Church bell? I did not tell
her about a church bell.

42:22.256 --> 42:25.125
I have missed you so much.

42:29.263 --> 42:31.297
This is for you.

42:56.255 --> 42:58.557
William, I'd like to apologize.

42:58.624 --> 43:01.693
- That isn't necessary. I...
- This was my choice, not yours.

43:01.761 --> 43:04.796
I can't blame you for my decisions.

43:06.732 --> 43:10.734
Well, I don't know what
we can do now, Julia.

43:10.802 --> 43:14.271
Darcy is my burden. I will deal with it.
