00:14.600 --> 00:17.520

00:19.320 --> 00:23.240
Stasi Prison, East Berlin, East Germany

00:26.080 --> 00:28.960
(A regular, deep tapping,
which continues for seconds)

00:32.960 --> 00:34.920
(A clinking response)

00:40.320 --> 00:41.840
(A whooshing sound)

00:43.120 --> 00:44.520
(Keys in locks)

00:45.440 --> 00:47.200
(A creaking door)

00:47.480 --> 00:48.520
(German)  Number two.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.560
Come.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.480
(Siren)

01:11.560 --> 01:12.560
Stop.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.760
Face the wall.

01:27.000 --> 01:27.840
(Siren)

01:27.920 --> 01:29.080
Move on.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.640
Move.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.040
Sit down on your hands.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.640
On your hands.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.080
Excuse me, sir.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.800
(The rustle of papers)

02:06.440 --> 02:08.080
Where are my daughters?

02:12.920 --> 02:14.520
I'm worried about my daughters.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.600
(A button is pushed)

02:21.160 --> 02:22.760
(A tape rolls in its player)

02:25.160 --> 02:26.320
Name?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.000
Martina Posimski-Fischer.

02:37.720 --> 02:38.920
Address?

02:40.240 --> 02:43.120
Drosselweg 17, 1532 Kleinmachnow.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.080
Good...

02:50.080 --> 02:51.720
Mrs. Fischer.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.680
The public prosecution department

02:56.760 --> 02:59.680
has opened preliminary investigations

03:01.840 --> 03:04.960
into your attempted
illegal border crossing, article 213,

03:05.040 --> 03:07.280
and illicit contacts,

03:07.360 --> 03:09.320
article 219.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.200
I have many questions.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.360
But first, let's agree on the facts.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.680
You attempted to illegally cross
the border into West Berlin,

03:22.760 --> 03:24.200
correct?

03:28.240 --> 03:29.080
Yes.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.720
And you forced your children
to participate in your crime.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.840
I didn't force them.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.200
It says here
that you drugged your youngest daughter.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.720
So she wouldn't panic.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.760
But why would she panic

03:42.240 --> 03:44.680
if she'd agreed to accompany you
on this illegal journey?

03:44.760 --> 03:47.560
She had to lie for a long time
in a small space.

03:47.640 --> 03:48.640
And it was warm.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.560
(Music fades in)

03:49.640 --> 03:51.120
She was meant to sleep through it.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.440
So not only did you drug your daughter,
but you endangered her life?

03:54.640 --> 03:56.960
I'm a doctor. I would never...

03:57.040 --> 03:58.920
Let me get this straight.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.320
You snatched your daughters
from their home.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.440
Stuffed them in the bowels
of a moving vehicle, and...

04:05.960 --> 04:07.680
drugged them
so they would sleep through it?

04:07.760 --> 04:10.120
Just tell me they're okay.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.840
Of course they're not okay!

04:12.720 --> 04:15.440
What child would be okay
under the circumstances?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.040
(Droning music builds)

04:18.160 --> 04:21.080
And what kind of mother
does this to her own children?

04:31.840 --> 04:34.920
So far, we are only discussing
the moral implications of your crimes.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.720
(White noise)

04:37.520 --> 04:40.000
We haven't even started
to explore their legal implications.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.800
I need to see my children!

04:42.240 --> 04:44.880
(A throbbing)

04:52.520 --> 04:54.240
-I confess to all of it.
-Good.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.440
In that case,
I'll need the names of everyone

04:57.520 --> 05:00.520
who participated in this plan
on both sides of the border,

05:00.600 --> 05:01.760
their personal details,

05:02.640 --> 05:04.560
and the specifics of their involvement.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.320
Now.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.320
(A pulsing)

05:15.880 --> 05:17.200
I acted alone.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.760
Alone.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.280
Your husband already gave us
all the details.

05:24.040 --> 05:24.920
I don't believe you.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.120
I want to hear
your side of the story.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.240
Where is my husband?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.600
(Suspenseful tones)

05:33.960 --> 05:35.000
(A mechanical click)

05:37.000 --> 05:38.240
No, please wait.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.280
Take your time, Mrs. Fischer.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.440
I'm not in any rush.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.600
When you're ready to talk,
I'll be ready to listen.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.800

05:48.880 --> 05:50.160

Even if they heard the radio broadcast.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.360

Tina was trying to escape,

how would they know
which border crossing, which car?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.800
The woman with the car was your friend?

06:39.880 --> 06:40.840
No.

06:40.920 --> 06:41.840
A friend of theirs?

06:41.920 --> 06:42.800
No.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.320
Some West-Berliner
from a church congregation, no idea.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.240
That's so dangerous.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.160
How could you have trusted
a complete stranger?

06:51.240 --> 06:52.920
I know how crazy it sounds.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.960
But this woman... Marianne?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.200
She was trustworthy.
And the plan was air-tight.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.920
No plan is air-tight.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.840
Only one other person knew about the plan.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.720
One.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.600
Martin.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.320
Martin?

07:06.400 --> 07:08.040
(Ominous drone)

07:08.840 --> 07:11.120
Why would your friend do that to you?

07:11.200 --> 07:12.680
He seemed so kind.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.400
It's so obvious.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
What?

07:16.440 --> 07:17.720
Haven't you read my book?

07:18.640 --> 07:21.960
The affair you had in East Germany
with a pregnant woman? Angela?

07:22.040 --> 07:22.840
Exactly.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.600
Well, "Angela" was Martin's girlfriend.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.120
When he showed up at my place,
he had one question:

07:27.200 --> 07:28.440
When did the affair start?

07:28.680 --> 07:29.880
(Tension mounting)

07:30.040 --> 07:32.720
He wanted to know for sure
that her child wasn't my son.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.080
So, are you?

07:36.440 --> 07:37.280
Honestly?

07:38.840 --> 07:40.120

08:24.000 --> 08:24.800

08:25.880 --> 08:27.200
What about his sister?

08:27.720 --> 08:29.080

08:40.560 --> 08:41.360
(Morning birdsong)

08:41.440 --> 08:42.920
And I need a new identity,

08:43.320 --> 08:46.280
so the HVA won't chase me around the world
for the rest of my life.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.360
If you can promise me that,

08:50.160 --> 08:52.040
I'll do anything the BND wants me to do.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.880
I talked to my superiors.
They only need a few more tests.

08:55.960 --> 08:56.880
What tests?

09:01.400 --> 09:04.080
They want to see how useful you are
before they get involved.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.760
I have to take an entrance exam
for the BND?

09:11.240 --> 09:12.240
(He snorts)

09:12.480 --> 09:14.160
No one doubts your skills.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.840
My bosses just want to make sure

09:17.920 --> 09:20.080
you have access to the inner circle.

(A door clacks)

09:55.000 --> 09:55.880
Good morning.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.880
Oh, Comrade Hartmann,

09:57.960 --> 09:59.880
these strawberries are fresh
from my mother's greenhouse.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.320
Would you like...

10:02.720 --> 10:04.200
I'm sorry, something's wrong.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.720
With my mother's strawberries?

10:07.680 --> 10:08.840
They're all fresh.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.120
Stop, please.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.480
(Anticipatory tones)

10:11.800 --> 10:12.600
May I?

10:14.440 --> 10:15.680
(A click-clicking)

10:15.840 --> 10:17.960
Only twice the normal levels
of radiation in here.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.400
-They're wonderful.
-In the lab it's almost four times higher.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.560
Now tell me about your progress
on Operation Microchip.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.440
Let me put it this way.
Operation Microchip again confirms

10:28.880 --> 10:30.760
that the biggest strength
of an organization

10:30.840 --> 10:32.880
-is also its biggest weakness.
-Aha.

10:32.960 --> 10:33.960
You mean our...

10:34.400 --> 10:35.400
worldwide network?

10:35.480 --> 10:36.440
No.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.560
Our secrecy.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.600
Normally the departments
should work together, hand in hand,

10:41.680 --> 10:44.200
but everyone is clinging
to their own knowledge.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.560
I don't understand it, either.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.960
The computer age offers
great opportunities for us all.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.480
You know what I always remember?

10:52.560 --> 10:53.640
That you once said,

10:53.720 --> 10:56.840
"At some point, all our knowledge
will fit into a pinhead."

10:56.920 --> 10:58.360
Do you remember Kyshtym?

10:58.440 --> 10:59.240
No.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.160
A plutonium production plant
in the Soviet Union exploded,

11:02.240 --> 11:06.280
and the fallout covered
more than 50,000 square kilometers.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.560
That was 1958.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.680
Right. But the Soviets
didn't tell anyone about it until 1976.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.320
Of course not, ha ha.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.360
Why?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.440
People would have just overreacted.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.800
And, I mean, there wasn't anything
they could do about it.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.760
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

11:20.840 --> 11:21.880
Strawberry?

11:38.920 --> 11:40.440

11:41.240 --> 11:42.200
I hate surprises.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.120
-Wait for it.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.120
Welcome to the BND.

(Revelatory tones)

12:11.360 --> 12:12.360
Mrs. Netz?

12:12.440 --> 12:13.240
Well.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.240
It's a small world.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
A whole new perspective.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.440
(A mechanical clicking)

12:20.400 --> 12:21.840
Hartmann, Fritz. Surveillance.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.520
He's the technical expert there.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.800
An East German technical expert.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.120
We call that an oxymoron.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.240
(A mechanical clicking, suspenseful tones

12:36.880 --> 12:37.840
I don't know her.

12:39.720 --> 12:40.960
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I am.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.080
(A mechanical clicking)

12:42.960 --> 12:44.880
Marcus Fuchs. He's the top commander.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.880
-Very good. Spelled with a C or a K?
-With a C.

12:48.360 --> 12:52.240
Is it typical for the top brass at the HVA
to recruit from within their own families?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.080
I don't know.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.360
(A mechanical clicking)

13:01.200 --> 13:02.720
(Music becoming apparent)

13:02.800 --> 13:04.360
Is this man your father?

13:06.280 --> 13:07.440
Yes.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.520
But there's nothing typical
about our relationship,

13:09.600 --> 13:10.880
personally or professionally.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.680
I wouldn't wish a father like him
on my worst enemy.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.080
Who is your worst enemy?

13:17.960 --> 13:18.800
My aunt.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.840
Breaking the trust of your own family
is an agent's greatest challenge.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.720
That assumes there was trust there
to begin with.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.600
Well, General Edel was devastated
when he found out who you really are.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.600
And you?

13:36.480 --> 13:37.400
I was impressed.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.040
(A mechanical clicking)

13:43.280 --> 13:44.160
Pretty.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.000
Our impression is that

13:46.080 --> 13:48.240
she's been rising up through
the ranks pretty quickly.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.680
And?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.360
Annett Schneider.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.120
The mother of my child.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.240
(A mechanical clicking)

14:02.480 --> 14:03.840
(Music fades)

14:06.920 --> 14:08.720
(Distant rumble)

14:11.360 --> 14:12.600
(Crockery clinks)

14:13.360 --> 14:14.920
(She clears her throat)

14:16.760 --> 14:18.960
Not a good week for us, Comrades.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.400
Our working relationship with
the pharmaceutical company Sprembex

14:22.480 --> 14:23.280
has been seriously damaged...

14:23.360 --> 14:24.560
I have some new ideas.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.560
About how to revive the relationship
with Sprembex.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.200
We'll see about that.

14:32.760 --> 14:35.280
This week Ms. Schneider
has showed great personal initiative.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.440
She caught a family of rogue citizens
fleeing our country without permission.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.120
Where do we stand
with Operation Love Boat?

14:43.880 --> 14:44.920
It's going well.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.000
The boat is scheduled for delivery
in Warnemünde next week,

14:48.080 --> 14:50.440
where it will be reconfigured
to hide the weapons shipment.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.560
I'll be in West Berlin today

14:52.640 --> 14:55.840
to secure the shipment of Würfel & Struth
submarine parts to South Africa.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.440
Frank Winkelmann at the
West German State Department in Cape Town

15:01.080 --> 15:02.280
has been very cooperative.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.480
(Electro tones kick in)

15:03.560 --> 15:05.000
That sounds like very good news.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.080
I'm very happy about the fact

15:08.160 --> 15:10.640
that you are now supporting us
with Operation Love Boat.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.880
But as the Americans like to say:

15:14.160 --> 15:16.840
'It ain't over till the fat lady sings.'

15:18.160 --> 15:19.440
(Hesitant laughter)

15:23.600 --> 15:24.960
Well,

15:25.040 --> 15:29.920
I'm already seeing a sky full
of Chinese fireworks for our celebration.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.480
What are we celebrating?

15:31.560 --> 15:32.960
The Wall.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.120
(Ah)

15:34.200 --> 15:36.840
This summer, it will be 25 years
since we built the Wall.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.520
I still haven't given
the Chinese fireworks a green light.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.360
We can still discuss this
in our smaller group.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.320
(Mechanical clicking)

15:44.480 --> 15:45.680
Lenora Rauch.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.360
Yes.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.680
Could you tell me a little more about her?

15:50.680 --> 15:54.560
Lenora is the front line
for KoKo in South Africa.

15:54.640 --> 15:58.560
Organizing deals to deliver hard currency
back into East Germany.

15:58.640 --> 16:01.360
All these Communists care about
these days is money.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.160
If the Wall ever falls, God forbid,

16:04.240 --> 16:07.040
these people will come and eat
the hair off our heads.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.080
Thank God I won't be around to see it.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.560
Your aunt is back

16:11.640 --> 16:13.000
in East Berlin.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.080
She registered for a day pass
to enter West Berlin today.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.640
She'll be crossing
at the Oberbaum border at 11:00.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.760
Bring her to us.

16:21.840 --> 16:22.880
Alive.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.760
Do you have a personal problem
with the assignment?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.480
-No.
-An ideological one?

16:28.560 --> 16:29.440
No.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.720
I believe that the Communist ideal
is entirely compromised,

16:34.120 --> 16:36.840
and is currently being operated
with malicious contempt.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.480
What I wonder is...

16:39.320 --> 16:41.360
how am I supposed to coax Lenora in here?

16:41.880 --> 16:44.040
Offer her free dental work?

16:44.960 --> 16:45.880
We'll think of something.

16:45.960 --> 16:46.760
Good.

16:47.400 --> 16:51.920
I'll assist you
with all available resources.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.920
Let me assure you
that we are far better equipped

16:56.000 --> 16:57.680
than our colleagues at the HVA.

16:58.920 --> 17:03.120
The two of you are entirely free
in your tactical approach.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.680
We in the West
aren't so keen on central planning.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.040
I like it.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.480
So, what are you waiting for?

17:12.560 --> 17:14.600
(Echoing, rising tones)

17:15.440 --> 17:16.680
(Bustling departures)

17:19.440 --> 17:20.520
One more thing.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.320
(A distant telephone rings)

17:28.800 --> 17:30.120
What is the current condition

17:30.200 --> 17:32.600
of our reserves of manganese solution
and potassium iodide?

17:32.840 --> 17:36.080
The nuclear energy plants
keep a supply, of course.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.560
And the Russians presumably...

17:38.040 --> 17:39.600
stockpile chemicals
to combat radiation...

17:39.680 --> 17:41.600
I'm talking about the general population.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.520
Why?

17:42.920 --> 17:47.000
The word is, radiation levels are
four times higher than normal in Sweden.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.280
Workers at Forsmark nuclear power plant

17:50.360 --> 17:53.040
found radioactive particles
on their clothes.

17:53.120 --> 17:53.960
Yeah.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.160
This is also in Sweden?

17:56.240 --> 17:57.080
Yes!

17:59.440 --> 18:00.960
You need to get out more,

18:01.520 --> 18:02.560
Comrade Hartmann.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.560
(A rising drone)

18:05.560 --> 18:07.080
(A door is unlocked, creaks)

18:07.200 --> 18:08.080
Number two.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.480
Come with me.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.800
(Persistent droning)

18:34.160 --> 18:36.000
(Droning reaches a crescendo)

18:36.240 --> 18:39.680
Grunewald, West Berlin, West Germany

18:48.880 --> 18:50.160
That's strange.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.120
It looks just like
her house in Johannesburg.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.680
The house you were raised in?

18:54.280 --> 18:56.320
Well, with the servants behind the house.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.920
(A clock strikes the hour)

18:58.320 --> 19:00.520
The Rosenbergs left this place
when the Nazis came.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.720
Then they rebuilt it in South Africa.

19:03.800 --> 19:04.920
Now they're back.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.400
In the original one.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.400
No one needs such a lavish house.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.000
Let alone two.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.880
(A doorbell rings)

19:19.880 --> 19:22.320
It's so nice seeing you
here in Germany, Rose.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.800
How's your mother?

19:29.880 --> 19:32.360
Still working for your old friends,
the Hermanns.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.280
I'm glad.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.920
Is little Tandi with her?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.120
Currently, yes.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.360
(Doves coo)

19:46.480 --> 19:47.920
(Expectant, rising tones)

20:01.240 --> 20:02.440
Thank you.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.080
Khaya.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.600
(English)  It's so wonderful to see you.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.800
They'll be there in a minute.
Please follow me.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.600
(German)  See you later.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.280
Thank you.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.360
(Birdsong, ambient soundtrack)

20:28.320 --> 20:29.920
(A door creaks as it opens)

20:30.520 --> 20:32.200
(Distant voices)
Thank you so much for your help.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.480
These photos are crucial for us.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.520
Our MK comrades need
false passports to move freely.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.840
They are all on international blacklists.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.760
How does the neighborhood look now?

20:41.920 --> 20:44.000
Most of your neighbors have left.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.640
To Great Britain or America.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.880
The Reese family still lives
in the blue house,

20:49.120 --> 20:51.360
but they are also planning to leave.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.960
Violence in South Africa
will soon be out of control.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.720
Out of control?

20:57.800 --> 21:00.120
You think the Apartheid regime
will give up without a fight?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.120
The Nazis didn't
give up so easily, either.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.520
No.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.040
You're very brave, Rose.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.520
Do I have a choice?

21:08.920 --> 21:11.160
But because I'm so brave,
my daughter is in danger.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.720
I want Tandi to come to West Berlin.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.360
To a relative.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.040
You have relatives in Germany?

21:18.640 --> 21:19.760
Tandi's father.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.760
Help me get my daughter
from South Africa to Germany.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.640
Do we agree that you owe me this?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.400
Of course.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.920
I'll be far away.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.080
In the underground.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.120
Or in prison, or worse.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.280
(A door opening)

21:40.680 --> 21:41.760
And one more thing.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.840
We need 100,000 dollars.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.040
That's a lot of money.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.040
What for, if I can ask?

21:49.360 --> 21:51.680
A new communications system.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.560
For MK freedom fighters in exile.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.120
(A pumping beat sets in)

21:57.000 --> 21:59.520
(Einstürzende Neubauten song Yü Gung)

22:56.920 --> 22:59.840
(English)  This way.
Watch your step... Follow me.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.840
So, here they are.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.920
-Hello.
-Oh, Kilian, I remember.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.600
-So nice to see you.
-Pleasure. I'm Lenora.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.600
Nice to meet you. So, who's first?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.680
-Maybe me?
-Yes.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.200
Yes. And...

23:17.600 --> 23:20.840
give me a half profile
and into the camera.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.720
A small passport smile, Khaya?

23:26.040 --> 23:27.680
All right. Good.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.720
Give me your scarf.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.920
-Maybe with a different jacket
-I have this one.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.200
And we have to lose the hat, sorry. Yes.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.040
Yes, that looks better.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.600
And, and a little smile.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.440
(Ominous bass)

23:44.520 --> 23:46.160
Please be careful, Rose.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.560
Always.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.160
We'll make sure
your daughter will get here safely.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.800
You can count on us.

23:51.880 --> 23:52.840
Thank you.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.080
I'll take the film
to East Berlin with me tonight.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.720
A courier will bring
the finished passports back here for you.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.720
-When?
-It's supposed to be Monday.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.160
-We'll coordinate our approach to go back.
-Of course.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.120
We can't have half the MK
entering South Africa at the same time.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.240
-Not yet.
-Not yet.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.480
(German)  Oh, shit.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.640
Come now, Mrs. Fischer.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.880
Where is my family?

24:31.880 --> 24:34.600
We'll get to that in a moment.
But first,

24:35.640 --> 24:37.160
help me understand.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.800
I see here that you graduated
top of your class.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.800
A distinguished educational record
and, later, career.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.520
A good job.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.360
A nice house. A beautiful family.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.120
Your brother was a troublemaker.
I see that here. But you...

24:52.880 --> 24:54.080
(Sighs)

24:55.920 --> 24:58.120
What did East Germany do to you?

25:02.240 --> 25:03.680
If I tell you the truth,

25:04.680 --> 25:06.640
will you tell me where my children are?

25:07.760 --> 25:08.640
Of course.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.040
Have you ever heard

25:18.120 --> 25:20.760
of a West Berlin company
called Sprembex Pharmaceutical?

25:22.240 --> 25:23.440
Just the other day.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.400
I listened to the recording
you made for western radio.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.200
Then you know my story.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.360
(A low-pitch drone)

25:41.440 --> 25:43.080
A version of it, yes.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.320
Surely, the truth is more complex.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.440
You're a monster.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.520
You're all monsters!

25:53.240 --> 25:55.120
How did you smuggle that recording
into the West?

25:55.200 --> 25:56.640
How did you know Marianne Stanschus?

25:57.080 --> 25:58.400
Was the church involved?

25:58.480 --> 26:00.040
My patients

26:00.120 --> 26:03.600
died from the side effects
of untested medicine.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.240
And the state told me
to look the other way.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.480
Why?

26:07.560 --> 26:10.760
Because Sprembex
was using my patients as guinea pigs.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.080
Sprembex is just another greedy
West German company.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.760
But no one forces our government
to do business with them!

26:16.640 --> 26:20.240
When did money become more important
to this country than human life?

26:20.400 --> 26:21.720
(Drone rises)

26:21.800 --> 26:23.000
(The door creaks)

26:23.080 --> 26:27.240
AIDS Hospice, West Berlin, West Germany

26:28.200 --> 26:29.000
Bye.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.200
See you tomorrow.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.160
You came.

26:37.080 --> 26:37.920
Of course.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.200
(Distressed calls)

26:45.360 --> 26:46.840
What you do here is really impressive.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.320
Yes.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.240
(Coughing)

26:51.880 --> 26:53.560
My political party has wanted

26:54.040 --> 26:55.960
to put AIDS on the agenda
for some time now.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.560
(Wheezing)

26:58.680 --> 26:59.760
And you?

27:01.480 --> 27:02.560
I've been...

27:03.240 --> 27:04.720
(Voices off-screen)

27:07.120 --> 27:09.320
I've been steering clear of all this.
Until now.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.720
Because I'm infected. I was frightened.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.560
(Pregnant pause)

27:26.280 --> 27:27.440
When the time comes,

27:28.440 --> 27:29.480
come here. We'll...

27:31.200 --> 27:32.720
We'll take care of you.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.880
But in the meantime,

27:37.840 --> 27:39.320
I'm on a mission.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.280
What mission?

27:40.360 --> 27:43.960
I have an appointment with the
head of clinical research at Sprembex.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.920
-The pharmaceutical company?
-Yes.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.240
I heard they're running
AZT trials over there,

27:49.320 --> 27:52.000
but AIDS sufferers aren't allowed
to voluntarily participate.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.280
Men are dropping like flies around here.
Ha.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.480
And AZT just might be our only hope.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.880
What do you have planned

28:02.480 --> 28:03.520
for your appointment?

28:03.680 --> 28:04.840
(Indistinct buzzing)

28:04.920 --> 28:06.240
Don't do anything stupid.

28:06.320 --> 28:10.560
Since when is civil disobedience stupid,
Professor Tischbier?

28:11.240 --> 28:12.840
(A keyboard holds a melancholy note)

28:13.520 --> 28:15.480
I learned everything about that from you.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.240
(Another melancholy note)

28:18.440 --> 28:20.240
(Another melancholy note)

28:20.320 --> 28:22.120
West Berlin, West Germany

28:22.200 --> 28:24.760
(Distant girl's voice, garage sounds)

28:25.120 --> 28:26.320
(Music fades out)

28:33.680 --> 28:35.040
(Car door opens)

28:38.440 --> 28:39.560
(Door closes)

28:44.320 --> 28:45.200
Rose?

28:46.840 --> 28:47.640
Yes.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.320
It's been so long.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.320
Eight years.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.280
(Incidental keyboard music)

29:01.800 --> 29:02.680
That's Tandi.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.840
I'm her mother and you're her father.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.120
She's living with my mother
in Johannesburg now.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.120
The address is in that folder.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.480
Along with everything you'll need
to claim paternity

29:17.560 --> 29:19.600
and get her German citizenship

29:20.720 --> 29:23.040
so you can bring her here
to live with you.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.360
Violence is coming to South Africa.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.320
I want my daughter somewhere safe.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.800
Don't let me down.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.760
(Door opens, closes)

29:41.720 --> 29:44.160
Yes. All right, I'll tell him.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.720
Sprembex Pharmaceutical,
West Berlin, West Germany

29:45.800 --> 29:46.600
Yes.

29:47.640 --> 29:51.520
Mr. Amend's meeting is running late,
but he'll be right here.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.760
Yeah. No problem. I'll do some more work.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.280
You're writing a thesis
on some of our work?

30:03.360 --> 30:07.520
About in-vitro studies of
infectious biological material.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.360
(Inhales nervously)

30:10.320 --> 30:11.720
Whatever that means.

30:11.800 --> 30:12.600
Yeah.

30:14.720 --> 30:15.720
Say,

30:15.800 --> 30:17.760
I need to make a copy of an article

30:17.840 --> 30:20.720
before I return this journal
to the college library.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.960
Is there a copy shop nearby?

30:25.240 --> 30:26.240
Don't be silly.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.840
We have a copy room right there.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.160
Back in a second.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.440
Oh. Thank you so much.

30:37.080 --> 30:37.960
(Door closes)

30:44.600 --> 30:45.920
(Tense, thumping music)

30:50.320 --> 30:52.120
(Distant electronic wailing)

31:11.800 --> 31:13.720
POTSDAM CLINIC
FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE

31:17.000 --> 31:18.280
BEST REGARDS, ANNETT SCHNEIDER

31:18.360 --> 31:19.440
What are you doing there?

31:20.200 --> 31:22.040
Oh, it's you again. Ha.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.840
What are you doing in the East, huh?

31:24.920 --> 31:27.120
Are you doing top-secret
AZT experiments there, too?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.520
That's enough, my friend.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.160
Put it down.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.280
Could you please connect me to security?

31:34.760 --> 31:35.840
Thank you.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.160
I said put the phone down.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.360
Are you crazy?

31:39.600 --> 31:41.320
People are dying here on your doorstep.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.320
You could hand out AZT
and save their lives.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.280
AZT hasn't been approved yet.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.480
It's illegal...

31:46.560 --> 31:48.080
-So what?
-It could have side effects.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.480
What could happen?

31:49.560 --> 31:51.800
What's worse than guaranteed death?

31:54.400 --> 31:55.520
(Buzzing)

32:05.480 --> 32:06.360
Hey, where's my bag?

32:06.640 --> 32:09.120
I just barely prevented you
from being locked up forever.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.720
Here.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.240
Did you really threaten
to contaminate him?

32:16.120 --> 32:17.120
I bluffed.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.200
(Snorts)

32:21.800 --> 32:22.920
I'm negative.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.160
Good.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.240
(A knocking)

32:34.400 --> 32:36.360
(The knocking continues)

32:41.920 --> 32:43.480
It's driving me crazy.

32:44.040 --> 32:44.880
(Shushing noise)

32:45.080 --> 32:47.400
(A higher-pitched knock as answer)

32:50.080 --> 32:51.240
(The first knock returns)

32:53.720 --> 32:55.240
Greetings from Christoph.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.640
(The first knock continues)

32:58.680 --> 33:00.760
I never told you my husband's name.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.680
No, but he did.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.280
He must be somewhere above us.

33:11.680 --> 33:12.560
A, B.

33:14.880 --> 33:15.800
A, B, C.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.240
A, B, C, D.

33:19.520 --> 33:23.960
Hm? Don't try to count. Just go:
A, B, C, D, E, F.

33:28.680 --> 33:29.480
No.

33:29.560 --> 33:30.360
Gosh, no.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.240
If you want to hear his voice,

33:33.720 --> 33:34.840
use the telephone.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.040
(A watery sound)

33:41.440 --> 33:43.000
(Water being scooped)

33:50.920 --> 33:51.960
(A startled sound)

34:06.480 --> 34:08.280
(A sudden clank, buzzing)

34:08.960 --> 34:10.080
(The play of metal)

34:19.000 --> 34:20.120
Christoph?

34:25.520 --> 34:26.480
Christoph!

34:30.360 --> 34:31.160
Tina?

34:32.800 --> 34:33.880
Yes!

34:35.240 --> 34:36.440
What have we done?

34:36.880 --> 34:38.160
Don't say that.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.240
Please.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.840
They took our children.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.640
It's all my fault.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.160
You wanted to go back,
but I insisted we carry on.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.800
They would've found us anyway!

34:54.320 --> 34:55.120
Christoph?

35:00.360 --> 35:01.240
Christoph!

35:01.560 --> 35:02.400
Hey.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.120
(Approaching footsteps)

35:11.680 --> 35:12.640
(Sob)

35:20.320 --> 35:22.600
(Enchanted music-box tones)

35:30.840 --> 35:32.840
Orphanage, East Germany

35:32.920 --> 35:34.760
Hansel and Gretel ran
through the forest. They ran and ran.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.120
Deep into the forest.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.320
(Music-box fades into synth notes)

35:37.520 --> 35:38.520
Until finally,

35:38.880 --> 35:40.280
they saw their house.

35:41.320 --> 35:42.120
And...

35:42.520 --> 35:43.360
they went in.

35:44.360 --> 35:45.640
They saw their dad.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.360
And they hugged him tight.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.480
(Wind instrument comes in)

35:50.560 --> 35:51.760
As hard as they could.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.920
Mom sent us away, too.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.560
That's not true, don't say that.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.560
She didn't want us anymore.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.080
She never had time for us.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.880
She always had to work.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.120
(Music-box returns)

36:07.200 --> 36:08.920
But when she stopped,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.840
she was just sad all the time.

36:11.760 --> 36:12.800
No.

36:12.880 --> 36:13.680
Stop it.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.000
But Mrs. von Kessel said...

36:17.080 --> 36:18.360
Mrs. von Kessel is lying.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.440
(Tones fade out)

36:28.000 --> 36:29.040
BND Field Office,
West Berlin, West Germany

36:29.120 --> 36:30.400
-I failed your test.
-I know.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.480
She got away. I have no idea where she is.
It all went so fast.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.080
You only had to sedate her,
the ambulance was there.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.040
-It wasn't that hard.
-Sure.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.040
Great.

36:39.120 --> 36:39.960
I screwed up.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.600
It doesn't matter anymore.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.440
Do you know what I'm risking?

36:44.520 --> 36:45.560
Yes, Brigitte, I know.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.480
You really think I did this on purpose?

36:48.080 --> 36:49.000
I don't know.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.920
It was my only chance to see my son.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.840
None of the higher-ups
have clocked this yet.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.160
Maybe we still have a chance.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.280
This morning my husband showed up
out of the blue.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.200
(Opens cabinet)

37:02.160 --> 37:03.920
And guess who he met this evening.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.160
(Keyboard music sets in)

37:13.480 --> 37:14.920
Maybe they're having an affair.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.200
I think it's German-German mafia business.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.080
We're sending you into the East
to find out.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.160
Where did you get this?

37:25.240 --> 37:26.880
One of our agents followed you today

37:26.960 --> 37:29.440
and picked up Lenora's trail
after you lost her.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.040
Who?

37:31.720 --> 37:33.360
I always know when I'm being followed.

37:36.040 --> 37:36.880
It was me.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.040
We'll show the photo to Mrs. Netz.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.320
It'll be enough to convince her.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.240
Thank you.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.560
East German Foreign Intelligence Service
HQ, East Berlin, East Germany

37:56.640 --> 37:59.000
(Door opens,
Keyboard fades into a dwindling wail)

38:01.240 --> 38:02.480
It's happening, isn't it?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.160
I mean, it happened.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.240
-Something's happened.
-Hartmann.

38:09.320 --> 38:12.880
It has come to our attention that
you've fallen prey to a conspiracy theory

38:12.960 --> 38:15.080
propagated by the American government.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.160
-What?
-My colleague Stepanov and I

38:19.240 --> 38:21.120
have come up from Dresden

38:21.720 --> 38:25.840
to set you straight before these
paranoid rumors travel any further.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.960
There has been
no nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.360
But everyone at our listening station
is reporting the same concerns:

38:33.440 --> 38:36.400
Radiation at four,
six or ten times normal levels

38:36.840 --> 38:38.520
-all across Scandinavia...
-Fake news!

38:40.120 --> 38:42.120
You're not a child, Comrade Hartmann.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.480
Why do you believe everything you hear?

38:44.560 --> 38:45.800
I don't.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.200
Actually, I never think
anyone is telling the truth.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.960
But my dosimeter doesn't lie.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.080
(Laughs)

38:56.920 --> 38:57.920
That instrument is old.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.440
We'll order you a new one from Moscow.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.960
Top Russian technology.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.000
In the meantime, please promote
a positive message of calm.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.920
There's no sense in getting people
all worked up over nothing.

39:14.360 --> 39:15.160
I thought

39:15.960 --> 39:19.000
maybe you could make
the weather forecast a bit more optimistic

39:19.080 --> 39:20.400
for the next few days.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.480
To elevate the mood.

39:23.920 --> 39:24.880
"Over nothing?"

39:29.920 --> 39:30.960
Fritz.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.720
We can't have fields of strawberries
going to waste

39:35.440 --> 39:37.560
just because of a nasty American rumor.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.600
(Telephone slams)

39:38.680 --> 39:39.720
(An ominous, repeating buzz)

39:51.000 --> 39:53.280
(Climaxing soundtrack, buzzing fades)

39:53.960 --> 39:56.120
There's been a huge nuclear meltdown
in Chernobyl.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.280
Gorbachev just announced it.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.040
(A long electronic ping)

40:05.360 --> 40:07.040
Good evening at 7 to 7.

40:07.120 --> 40:10.240
After the biggest accident ever
at a nuclear reactor,

40:10.680 --> 40:12.760
people across Europe are asking:

40:12.840 --> 40:15.280
"Are we in danger? Are we contaminated?

40:15.360 --> 40:17.200
Will the wind drive the radioactive cloud

40:17.280 --> 40:20.280
from the damaged Soviet reactor
across our country?"

40:21.240 --> 40:24.040
The Soviets did not
warn European governments

40:24.120 --> 40:27.040
that a huge radioactive cloud
was drifting northwest.

40:27.520 --> 40:31.320
The wind drove the cloud across Poland
and the Baltic Sea to Scandinavia.

40:31.400 --> 40:36.800
In Sweden on Sunday, scientists measured
10x more radioactivity there than usual.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.200
The question now is,

40:39.280 --> 40:42.840
will the wind turn south
as shown here in our animation?

40:42.920 --> 40:44.640
The meteorologists say no:

40:44.720 --> 40:48.120
There is no current
that could drive the cloud to Germany.

40:48.200 --> 40:51.680
If the weather changes, nevertheless,
we will inform you immediately.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.120
The Scandinavian governments
have sharply protested

40:57.200 --> 41:01.240
that the Soviet Union did not warn them
about the huge radioactive cloud.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.000
It is indeed unbelievable

41:03.080 --> 41:07.560
that the Soviet Union tried to conceal
such a catastrophe.

41:07.640 --> 41:11.000
The Soviet authorities are
not exactly eager to offer details

41:11.080 --> 41:13.320
about the reactor itself

41:13.400 --> 41:15.440
or the nature of the breakdown involved.

41:15.520 --> 41:18.280
The radioactive cloud over Scandinavia

41:18.360 --> 41:23.040
has been found to contain
radioactive neptunium, iodine and cesium.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.560
From this it can be concluded

41:24.640 --> 41:27.440
that the core of the reactor
has actually melted.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.680
So the biggest-ever disaster that...

41:33.320 --> 41:34.200
So?

41:35.600 --> 41:36.800
Where is Lenora Rauch?

41:39.960 --> 41:40.920
We're on her.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.120
(A gentle piano sets in)

41:50.200 --> 41:52.520
(The lyrical folk song "Es dunkelt
schon in der Heide" is sung)

41:52.600 --> 41:55.120
Border Restaurant for Western Tourists,
East Berlin, East Germany

41:58.680 --> 42:00.080
Professor Tischbier.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.480
Have a seat.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.240
Finally we meet in person.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.320
You're very pretty, Ms. Schneider.

42:08.680 --> 42:09.720
I didn't expect that.

42:10.520 --> 42:12.400
Is that a compliment or an insult?

42:14.000 --> 42:15.120
I just mean,

42:15.960 --> 42:18.560
no wonder our super spy
so badly wants to go home.

42:18.880 --> 42:19.880
What would you like?

42:20.360 --> 42:21.920
Two glasses of
your best champagne, please.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.080
Or sparkling wine.

42:25.080 --> 42:26.480
Isn't that a bit premature?

42:26.560 --> 42:28.120
We haven't agreed on anything yet.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.000
The government of West Germany is ready

42:32.960 --> 42:35.000
to exchange Martin Rauch
for these individuals.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.320
(The folk song's
woman's vocals continue)

42:44.920 --> 42:46.520
Thirteen people for one.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.200
That's not a good deal.

42:51.960 --> 42:55.000
This is not an Israeli-Palestinian
prisoner exchange.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.960
Are you saying that Martin Rauch
isn't worth that much to East Germany?

43:00.880 --> 43:02.240
Or to you?

43:06.440 --> 43:07.520
Thank you very much.

43:07.720 --> 43:08.680
You're welcome.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.520
-Thank you.
-Sure.

43:13.680 --> 43:16.200
That little asshole
knows too much about us.

43:16.920 --> 43:20.120
We can't let him
run around Western Europe any longer.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.600
(Song concludes)

44:13.040 --> 44:16.440
(Thriller-style music)

44:52.040 --> 44:54.040
(Eerie music)

46:01.360 --> 46:03.000
