for your assessment.

Right, well if you've
been deemed fit for work,

12:59.600 --> 13:01.716
your only option is Jobseeker's Allowance.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.920
Or proceed with the appeal on
Employment and Support.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.237
Well, can you give me a form for...

13:06.360 --> 13:07.800
You know, erm, Jobseeker's Allowance

13:07.920 --> 13:10.309
and then an appeal form
Employment and Support?

13:10.440 --> 13:11.839
You have to apply online, sir.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.030
(SIGHS) I cannot do that.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.601
Well that's how it is, sir.
Or you can phone the helpline.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.756
(SIGHS) Listen, you know,
you give me a plot of land,

13:18.760 --> 13:20.079
I can build you a house.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.759
But I've never been
anywhere near a computer.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.751
D'you know what, we're digital by default.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.034
Oh, here we gan.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.759
I hear this all the time on the phone,
"I'm digital by default."

13:28.760 --> 13:30.591
Well I'm pencil by default.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.479
Look, I mean, what happens
if you just cannae do it?

13:33.760 --> 13:36.957
There's a special number
if you've been diagnosed as dyslexic.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.630
Right, well can you give us that?
Cos with computers I'm dyslexic.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.797
You'll find it online, sir.
I must ask you to leave now,

13:43.880 --> 13:46.474
- if you've got no appointment.
- (DAN SIGHS)

13:50.200 --> 13:52.240
- (WOMAN COUGHING)
- MANAGER: Right, can I help you?

13:52.360 --> 13:55.511
Yeah, I'm here to see about
changing my work coach.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.955
- (DAN EXHALES)
- Thomas Armstrong, please.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.798
Hang on a minute, Thomas, hang on.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.309
Erm, would you like to take a seat?

14:05.440 --> 14:08.876
Oh, I just need a minute. I just felt...
I'm just feeling dizzy, you know.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.798
- Come and sit down.
- Oh, cheers, thanks.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.313
Could you move up, please, love?

14:14.440 --> 14:16.078
Thanks, pet, thank you.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.590
- All right. I'll just get you a glass of water.
- (SIGHS) Thank you.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.709
Oh, thank you, pet.
Thank you.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.637
Are you all right?
You look a bit pale.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.832
It's just so bloody confusing,
all the jargon.

14:36.280 --> 14:39.440
I mean, there must be some mistake.
I'm just ganning round and round in circles.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.296
KATIE: I've, I've really gotta
get this sorted out.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.816
SHEILA: Oh I can understand that,
but you were late.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.515
Thomas. You sit here
and drink your water, pet.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.834
Thank you.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.336
So now you're gonna sanction me so, er...

14:51.360 --> 14:53.828
- No, I'm not gonna sanction you.
- I may not get any money for a month.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.416
I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker
and they'll make the decision

14:56.440 --> 14:58.416
- on whether they're gonna sanction you.
- That's ridiculous...

14:58.440 --> 15:00.536
I'm not actually making the decision,
they're gonna do that.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.630
SHEILA: And then if they do decide
to sanction you,

15:02.760 --> 15:03.875
then you will take a 40%
cut in your benefits.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.016
KATIE: I know what it is,
I don't need you to explain it to me.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.856
- I'm more than aware...
- Well there isn't anything else

15:07.880 --> 15:08.869
anybody can do today.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.456
So what I'm gonna have to do is,
look, I think I'm...

15:10.480 --> 15:12.256
I've decided to...
Are you gonna put me in for a sanction?

15:12.280 --> 15:13.416
I have to, I have to follow the rules.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.016
And the thing is if you're gonna,
be aggressive with me

15:15.040 --> 15:17.696
- then I'm gonna have to ask you...
- It's not about me being aggressive.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.576
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I'm trying to explain to you a situation

15:20.600 --> 15:21.635
and you don't care.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.696
- SHEILA: Er, security. Security?
- I don't know why people like you do this job.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.869
SHEILA: I'm referring you
to the decision maker.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.792
KATIE: It's all the same thing.
I don't wanna hear your language

15:28.880 --> 15:30.776
- SHEILA: I, I beg your pardon.
- Listen, I, I'm sorry, love,

15:30.800 --> 15:32.536
- but you're gonna have to leave.
- Yeah, all right, frankly,

15:32.560 --> 15:34.136
take your hands off me.
I'm gonna speak to the manager,

15:34.160 --> 15:36.776
- I don't wanna speak to you.
- The fact is I'm just trying to explain...

15:36.800 --> 15:37.936
- Sorry?
- I'm just explaining...

15:37.960 --> 15:39.136
Well it's not you I wanna speak to...

15:39.160 --> 15:40.976
- You can go back up there.
- Right, come and talk to me then

15:41.000 --> 15:42.776
- if you've got something to say.
- Okay. Sorry.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.915
All right.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.536
I've tried to explain to the woman,
I've never been to Newcastle before.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.913
We've just moved up here from London.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.336
I've been here a few days,
I don't know where I'm going. Okay?

15:50.360 --> 15:51.918
I was on the bus, it's gone the wrong way.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.480
We've run, got off the bus,
run so that I wasn't any more late.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.198
She just don't wanna know

15:56.320 --> 15:58.456
and now she's telling me
she's gonna refer me for a sanction.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.153
MANAGER: What I want you to
do is listen to me. Okay?

16:01.280 --> 16:02.838
The lady's told you what's right.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.388
There's rules here,
rules that we have to stick to. Okay?

16:05.520 --> 16:07.976
- It isn't against you, but you have a duty.
- Oh, mate, listen,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.833
- I'm not saying it's against me.
- You have a duty to be here on time.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.909
And I'm explaining to you

16:11.920 --> 16:13.399
why I wasn't here on time.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.875
- D'you know what? I understand, right...
- I got lost.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.190
But what I gather now
is the decision maker...

16:18.320 --> 16:20.896
The decision maker's gonna be
sending you a letter through the post.

16:20.920 --> 16:21.909
So you're gonna have to wait for that.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.016
- And then nobody...
- Yeah, I've got... My kids

16:23.040 --> 16:25.736
have gotta start school tomorrow.
I've got about 12 quid in my purse.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.936
- D'you know what?
- All because you can't just calm down

16:27.960 --> 16:28.949
- and listen to people when they talk.
- Right.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.096
- You have to do this.
- Right, d'you know what,

16:30.120 --> 16:32.296
- I've listened to you. You've created a scene.
- With your rules.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.496
- I think you need to...
- I've created a scene?

16:33.520 --> 16:35.736
- You need to leave the building.
- If I was gonna create a scene,

16:35.760 --> 16:36.856
you'd know about it, trust me.

16:36.880 --> 16:37.949
I'm sorry, love,
but you are gonna have to go.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.960
This is ridiculous.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.536
- Jesus Christ!
- What am I supposed to do?

16:40.560 --> 16:42.136
- Who's first in this queue?
- MAN: I am.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.674
D'you mind if this young
lass signs on first?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.756
- MAN: No, no, you carry on.
- There you go.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.519
Now you can go back to your
desk and let her sign on

16:49.640 --> 16:51.870
and do the job that the
taxpayer pays you for.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.474
- DAN: This is a bloody disgrace.
- Listen, all right,

16:54.600 --> 16:55.953
this doesn't have to involve you.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.236
Everybody's trying to do their job here
and you're creating more of a scene again.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.656
But, look, you're not listening to her.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.240
She's out of the area.
She's just been a few minutes...

17:03.360 --> 17:05.920
Can you not let her sign on?
She's got two kids with her, man.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.976
- DAN: What's wrong with you people?
- Right, listen, this isn't your concern.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.455
I want you to get out as well. All right?

17:10.480 --> 17:12.789
I need you to leave.
We need to do this right. Yeah.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.455
- All right.
- Listen, listen, listen...

17:14.480 --> 17:16.056
- They're just gonna call the police.
- Phone the police.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.672
Can we get some perspective in here?

17:17.800 --> 17:19.656
You need to go or we're gonna
phone the police. All right?

17:19.680 --> 17:20.874
Come on. Thanks very much...

17:21.000 --> 17:22.656
Can we have a bit of perspective,
please, here, man?

17:22.680 --> 17:24.136
- Away, don't be silly.
- Shouldn't even have this job.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.496
- Come on. Please.
- Shouldn't even have this job.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.215
- Come on, get out.
- All she needs is help, man.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.880
- Let's get going.
- Just let her sign on.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.239
Let's get going, all right.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.669
Please.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.976
I don't know what's wrong
with you lot, I really don't.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.877
I need you to keep going for me, okay?

17:40.840 --> 17:44.240
- You want me to take one of them bags?
- No, it's all right, I'm fine, pet. I'm fine.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.038
- Where's Dylan?
- I don't know.

I'm gonna make this place a home.

You don't know how to
fix a cistern, do you?

18:41.360 --> 18:42.759
It's driving me insane.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.560

- Yeah?

19:10.960 --> 19:11.995
Yeah.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.314
Yeah, all right. All right. Yeah.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.109
It's nice, it's nice.
There's plenty of space.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.136
And, erm, yeah, it looks like they've put...
There's a nice bit of fresh carpet down.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.833
The, the walls are all
nicely painted and that.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.716
No, I know, Mum. Well, look, once...
Once you're feeling better and we're settled,

19:31.840 --> 19:35.040
then you'll have to come up. You can come
up with Auntie May and stay, can't you?

Yeah, they're nice, yeah, friendly.
Friendlier than London.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.312

D'you wanna have a word with Daisy?

Hello, Mum.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.271
All right. That's all right.
All right, I'll speak... Yeah, I've gotta go

20:11.400 --> 20:13.038
but I'll speak, I'll call you tomorrow.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.936

- All right, love you.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.554
- KATIE'S MUM: Love you, too. Bye.
- Bye, bye, bye.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.520
So what are you doing up here, Katie?

20:22.600 --> 20:24.656
KATIE: It started when we got
kicked out of the flat.

20:24.680 --> 20:25.954
We got in a bit of trouble.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.189
It was ridiculous.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.840
In Dylan's room there was a leak
coming through the wall,

20:29.960 --> 20:32.000
coming through the top of the ceiling
down the wall.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.816
And it was making him really sick.
Weren't it, Dais?

20:33.840 --> 20:35.416
- Remember when Dylan weren't well?
- Yeah.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.556
We had to run all the way to the hospital.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.193
Yeah, he was in and out the hospital.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.176
I was talking to the landlord about it,
spoke to him.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.191
And cos I complained, kicked us out.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.480
What, they can just do that?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.200
- Just throw you out?
- KATIE: Yeah, yeah.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.996
KATIE: So we got out of there.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.873
We was in a homeless hostel
for about two years, waiting on a flat.

20:52.360 --> 20:56.876
Yeah. But it was close to their school
which they loved, so...

20:57.600 --> 21:00.876
We just had to stick it out.
But we was in one room,

21:01.200 --> 21:02.189
the three of us were in one room.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.360
Like eating, sleeping, all the rest of it
and Dylan was just climbing the walls.

21:05.400 --> 21:09.109
Honestly,
like boxed in like that, so, yeah.

21:09.720 --> 21:13.759
They eventually offered me a flat,
so the good news was it was a flat.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.518
Bad news was it was up here.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.056
And they couldn't give you
anywhere near your family?

21:18.080 --> 21:19.229
No, not in London.

21:19.240 --> 21:23.233

I think you've been shoplifting.

59:50.800 --> 59:53.880
Would you like to come with me to the
manager's office and we can sort it out?

59:53.960 --> 59:55.188
I haven't been shoplifting.

59:55.400 --> 59:57.696
Okay, you have, and I've seen you.
So if you'd like to come with me...

59:57.720 --> 59:59.296
No, I've got a receipt.
I've got, I've just,

59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.936
- the lady there's just served me.
- Okay, and if everything on your receipt

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.416
is all you've got on you,
then there's no problem.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.536
If you'd just like to come this way
to the manager's office.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.549
No, I'm not going to the manager's office.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.856
You just stood there and watched
her serve me, I've got a receipt.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.480
I can lock the door and call the police.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.496
You're talking about locking the
door and calling the police.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.136
Would you like to come with me
to the manager's office?

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.040
No, because I've just, you've
just watched me...

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.320
Okay, and we'll sort that out.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.536
Okay, and if everything
on the receipt's in your bags,

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.296
- then there's no problem.
- You don't need to shout at me.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.800
Okay, if you'd like to come this way.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.816
She's just, you've just stood
there and watched it...

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.176
- Okay, then we'll sort it out.
- ...and serve me with, didn't you?

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.599
And she's given me a receipt.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.835
Just this way.

right till the end?

Well, you know, I thought it'd be
a relief when she passed away.

you know, when she was ill.

been in contact with all these employers?

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.993

I went to the library,
there's my appointment card.

to a decision maker for a possible
sanction for four weeks.

Your payment will be frozen.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.674
You may be entitled
to Hardship Allowance if you apply.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.959
Do you understand?

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.312
And if you are sanctioned, you must
continue to look for work and sign on.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.352
If you don't, you may be sanctioned again.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:04.152
And it's likely to be for thirteen weeks
on the second occasion, and thereafter.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.752
And likely to be the maximum
of up to three years.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.151

you a referral to a food bank?

No, really, I'm fine.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.908
You haven't given us a row
about leaving the rubbish out.

I'm okay, China, really.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.592
If you need anything, Dan, let me know.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.234
Absolutely anything.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.037

Aye, fair enough.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.954

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.994
So, what happens now?

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.750
Right, this is a copy of the caution sheet.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.197
Because you fully admitted the offences

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.191
and you've been of good
character in the past,

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.193
we're cautioning you for the offence
of criminal damage,

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.754
under Section Five of the Public Order Act.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.117
But please remember
that these can come back

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.152
and haunt you if you re-offend.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.356
So try to keep yourself out of trouble.

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.835
Aye.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.560
SENIOR OFFICER: See him out, please.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.393
Dan. Dan!

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.637
Come, I need to talk to you.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.838
DAISY: We called you loads of times.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.995
Dan!

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.990
DAISY: Mum's been so sad lately.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.398
Why don't you speak to her?

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.038
Don't you have credit on the phone?

(SIGHS)

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.320
I see you.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.310
We understand what happened to your heart.

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.031
Mum spoke to one of your neighbours.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.113
We didn't know about it.

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.114
DAISY: It's cold out here.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360
I'm freezing.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.352
Please, Daisy, I'm not feeling very well.

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.152
I made you some couscous.

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.992
And Dylan sent you his lollipop.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.353
He's really missing you, too.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:24.352
Just go, Daisy, please.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.118
Can I ask you one question, Dan?

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.074
Did you help us?

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.954
DAN: (WEAKLY) Suppose so.

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.713
So why can't I help you?

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400
I'm sorry.

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.393
I'm sorry, Daisy.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.189
I'm really sorry.

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:10.189
You know, I'm not usually a nervous person,
Katie, but I'm nervous about this.

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:11.919
It's only natural, Dan.

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.439
I just want it done, you know?

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.432
Yeah. Well, you're prepared.
You got all your papers.

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.431
You've got a good,
good person representing you.

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:21.593
And then when you're done,
you can come, come to dinner to celebrate.

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:24.240
The kids are really looking
forward to seeing you.

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.595
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:50.479
Hi, er, Daniel Blake. I've come for my
appeal for the reinstatement of my...

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.471
Employment and Support Allowance.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.710
- Daniel, hi. Hello. Are you all right?
- Hello.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.195
- Hi, I'm Katie. I'm a friend of Daniel's.
- Hi.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.629
- You're here for support, yeah?
- (SOFTLY) Yeah.

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:12.032
Daniel, your appeal will be heard by a
legally qualified chairperson and a doctor.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.113
- Aye, fingers crossed.
- Yeah...

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.754
If I lose this appeal,
I'm out on the streets.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.839
Well, we've got some updated
reports here from your GP,

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.435
your own consultant and your
physiotherapist.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.195
And they're all furious.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.714
You're gonna win this, Dan.

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.112
I do this every week.

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:33.920
- I bet me life on it.
- (SOFTLY) I told ya.

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.520
(SIGHS)

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.470
Just be yourself,
answer the questions and relax.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.472
I'm really confident.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.519
D'you have any questions?

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:48.921
(SIGHS) Well, I've got one or two things
I'd like to get off me chest.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.310
- But will they listen?
- It's the least they can do.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:52.834
And can I go in with him?

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.513
I'll certainly ask.
Would you like her to?

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.800
- Yeah. Definitely, yeah.
- Yeah?

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.274
Okay, I'll certainly ask.
No problem at all.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.112
All right. Thank you.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.039
My pleasure.
I'll just go and see what the score is.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.516
- (SIGHS) Yeah.
- Sounds good, don't it?

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.509
Look at them.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:13.956

my life in their hands.

phone an ambulance, please? 9-9-9.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.875
Erm...

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.874
They call this a "pauper's funeral"
because it's the cheapest slot, at 9:00.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.918
But Dan wasn't a pauper to us.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:27.473
He gave us things that money can't buy.

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.757
When he died, I found this on him.

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.511
He always used to write in pencil.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.555
Erm...

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.751
And he wanted to read it at his appeal
but he never got the chance to.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.598
And I swear that this lovely man,

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.033
had so much more to give,

01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.317
and that the State drove him
to an early grave.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.754
And this is what he wrote.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.354
"I am not a client, a customer,
nor a service user.

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.789
