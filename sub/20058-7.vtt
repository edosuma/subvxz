00:16.792 --> 00:18.250
I'm not talking first.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.333
And why would you, Skull?

00:20.417 --> 00:23.833
That would actually require you
to do something other than float!

00:23.917 --> 00:25.500
You see,
this is what I'm talking about.

00:25.583 --> 00:26.958
This is what she does!

00:27.042 --> 00:29.000
She talks down to me constantly,

00:29.083 --> 00:30.417
but when she summons me,

00:30.500 --> 00:32.667
I'm just supposed to appear
at her beck and call?

00:32.750 --> 00:35.250
That's how it works, Skull!

00:35.333 --> 00:37.792
I'm a sorceress!
You're a familiar.

00:37.875 --> 00:40.000
I summon you to do my bidding!

00:40.083 --> 00:42.292
Hex! Skull! Please!

00:42.375 --> 00:44.292
In order for your partnership to work,

00:44.375 --> 00:46.375
you can't bottle up your feelings.

00:46.458 --> 00:49.917
You have to express yourselves
as openly as you can,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.917
despite how much you might...

00:52.000 --> 00:55.208
Uh, you might just... hide your fears.

00:55.292 --> 00:57.625
Wait, we should hide our fears?

00:57.708 --> 00:59.792
- What? No, no!
- Sorry.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.625
No, uh, where was I?

01:01.708 --> 01:02.750
Uh, right!

01:02.833 --> 01:06.458
You need to be honest
about how you really feel.

01:07.292 --> 01:09.500
Focus on the problems in front of you.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.167
Don't run away from them, Hugo.

01:13.833 --> 01:16.875
You're Hugo. I'm Skull. That's Hex.

01:16.958 --> 01:19.167
What? Oh, um, right.

01:19.250 --> 01:20.500
Don't be someone you're not.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.750
Be someone you are.

01:22.833 --> 01:28.958
And who I am... is someone
deathly afraid of sheep!

01:30.333 --> 01:33.083
He's the only one
who takes our insurance.

02:11.625 --> 02:12.792
Shh!

02:16.833 --> 02:18.167
Yeah, I don't know what any of that means.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.458
Anyone else?

02:19.542 --> 02:21.708
Guys, it means this is our target.

02:21.792 --> 02:24.250
Intel indicates Chef Pepper Jack
has been working here

02:24.333 --> 02:27.708
on his latest lethal recipe
to terrorize the Skylands.

02:27.792 --> 02:29.542
Our mission is to take him out tonight!

02:29.625 --> 02:30.917
And not for nothing, JV,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.292
but couldn't you have just
said that without all the hand stuff?

02:34.375 --> 02:40.375
Stupid, dumb,
tangly, non-fire-retardant ropes!

02:40.458 --> 02:42.417
Zip it!

02:42.500 --> 02:45.167
I am shushing!
Let's just get on with the mission!

02:50.833 --> 02:51.875
What?

02:53.542 --> 02:56.375
You can't just call
for a reservation the same day.

02:57.667 --> 02:58.708
Well, of course I can do it,

02:58.792 --> 03:02.875
but it means calling in a favor
and I hate being that guy, Andre.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.250
Okay, okay, I'll see you at 7:00,
but you owe me.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.208
Love to Chandra and the kids.

03:09.292 --> 03:11.667
Good evening.
What name is your reservation under?

03:11.750 --> 03:12.875
Uh, yeah!

03:12.958 --> 03:15.750
Yeah, it should be under
Skylander... er... Son.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.083
Skylandersson.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.333
Ah, here it is.
Right this way.

03:22.292 --> 03:27.833
Ooh-whee! This here chili recipe
is my nastiest concoction yet!

03:27.917 --> 03:29.417
Once I've perfected it,

03:29.500 --> 03:32.417
it's gonna burn a hole
through every stomach it meets

03:32.500 --> 03:35.500
at the Skylanders Annual
Chili Chomp Competition!

03:36.500 --> 03:39.458
Kaos! Where are my kidney beans?

03:39.542 --> 03:41.042
Got them right here,
Chef Pepper Jack!

03:41.125 --> 03:42.917
Just one question.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.333
How do they get the kidneys
inside the beans?

03:46.375 --> 03:47.583
Give me that!

03:47.667 --> 03:50.500
How about you leave
the deep thoughts to me, Kaos?

03:50.583 --> 03:52.750
We've got a big problem!

03:52.833 --> 03:56.000
Table eight still doesn't
have their amuse-bouche!

03:56.083 --> 03:58.042
Here, let me amuse your bouche!

03:58.125 --> 03:59.792
Now, you listen here.

03:59.875 --> 04:03.708
This troll may be your servant
outside this restaurant,

04:03.792 --> 04:06.792
but in my kitchen,
you're all equally worthless!

04:06.875 --> 04:10.500
Now we've got guests,
so start plating the gazpacho

04:10.583 --> 04:12.833
so I can concentrate on my chili!

04:12.917 --> 04:17.000
My napkin keeps falling
off my lap and the butter's too hard.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.458
And what does a sentient
lava creature have to do

04:19.541 --> 04:22.083
to get a piece of bread in this joint?

04:22.167 --> 04:24.667
Eruptor, chill!
We don't need any unwanted attention!

04:24.750 --> 04:27.083
Well, do we want any menus?

04:27.167 --> 04:28.958
'Cause it's been ten minutes

04:29.042 --> 04:31.667
and a waiter hasn't even
taken our drink orders!

04:33.542 --> 04:35.292
Finally!

04:35.375 --> 04:37.875
I am so sorry about
the slow service tonight.

04:37.958 --> 04:40.375
We have some new help
in the kitchen.

04:40.458 --> 04:44.042
And by "help," I mean
learn your elbow from an egg beater,

04:44.125 --> 04:46.250
am I right?

04:50.500 --> 04:52.125
Ah, to make up for the delay,

04:52.208 --> 04:55.333
here is a Wagyu beef-and-white truffle
gazpacho

04:55.417 --> 04:57.292
emulsified with unicorn tears.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.917
Compliments of the house.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.167
Whoa!

05:02.250 --> 05:05.375
Cold soup?

05:05.458 --> 05:07.917
What a violation of nature!

05:08.000 --> 05:09.042
I suppose I should have realized

05:09.125 --> 05:12.333
that haute cuisine might be beyond
the cultural grasp of a talking rock.

05:12.417 --> 05:16.000
Talking rock?
I'll show you talking rock!

05:16.083 --> 05:19.958
Dude, relax! You actually are
a talking rock! It's not an insult!

05:20.042 --> 05:22.958
Seriously, simmer down!
You're gonna blow our cover!

05:23.042 --> 05:25.083
I am not going to simmer down...

05:25.167 --> 05:28.083
I am not going to blow our cover...

05:28.167 --> 05:31.833
and cold soup is an abomination!

05:38.250 --> 05:40.542
Skylanders!

05:40.625 --> 05:42.667
You do not have a reservation!

05:44.167 --> 05:46.542
I guess the bad guys
figured out it was us.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.667
Wonder how that happened?

05:48.750 --> 05:52.500
Now, that is good soup.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.125
Don't lose sight of the mission, team.

05:54.208 --> 05:55.667
Pepper Jack is getting away!

05:55.750 --> 05:57.333
Elf, you and Spyro take the kitchen,

05:57.417 --> 05:59.208
while Pop and I will try
and head him off out front!

05:59.292 --> 06:00.583
And, Eruptor, cool off!

06:00.667 --> 06:01.667
Go, go, go!

06:01.750 --> 06:02.792
No, Claire!

06:02.875 --> 06:06.250
I made a reservation six months ago
under the name "Skylandersson"

06:06.333 --> 06:08.375
and I want our table now!

06:08.458 --> 06:10.917
Jeez. Angry much?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.625
Dude, you've got to do something
about your anger issues.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.875
Your temper kept us
from taking down Pepper Jack!

06:18.958 --> 06:20.375
I do not have anger issues!

06:20.458 --> 06:23.875
If I have anger issues, you'll know it
because I'll be extremely angry!

06:23.958 --> 06:28.125
But not as angry as it makes me
when Elf walks on my left side!

06:28.833 --> 06:32.208
You know how much I hate it
when people walk on that side!

06:32.292 --> 06:36.667
Eruptor, you need to stop
blowing your top at every little thing!

06:37.833 --> 06:41.458
Ow! Who put that sidewalk there?

06:41.542 --> 06:45.042
Stop pushing my buttons, world!

06:45.125 --> 06:47.167
Die, footpath!

06:51.292 --> 06:56.625
Okay...
maybe I have a tiny anger problem.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.958
Well, I still don't think my anger thingy
is a big deal, Master Eon,

07:02.042 --> 07:04.583
but if you really want me
to talk to someone about it,

07:04.667 --> 07:06.625
I'll give it a whirl.

07:06.708 --> 07:07.792
I am pleased to hear that.

07:07.875 --> 07:11.583
Anger can be a tool, but giving in to it
can only lead to defeat,

07:11.667 --> 07:13.500
suffering and...

07:13.583 --> 07:15.708
How many times
do I have to tell you dirty hippies

07:15.792 --> 07:19.042
to peddle your third-rate beard supplies
at some other academy?

07:19.125 --> 07:20.792
Organic doesn't mean
third-rate, man.

07:22.875 --> 07:23.875
And we're back.

07:23.958 --> 07:26.292
Whoa, impressive.

07:27.875 --> 07:30.167
You see,
there is light and dark within us all.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.750
Anger can be as much a force
for good as any other emotion.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.750
It is all about balance.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.708
If we fall too far in any one direction,

07:37.792 --> 07:41.292
we can hurt not only ourselves,
but also those around us.

07:41.375 --> 07:45.292
Huh. Kind of like a spiritual version
of the butterfly effect, eh?

07:45.375 --> 07:46.833
Hmm. Why not?

07:46.917 --> 07:48.333
Now, I think you'll be surprised

07:48.417 --> 07:50.917
just how helpful talking
to a fully licensed and bonded

07:51.000 --> 07:52.958
anger management therapist
can be, Eruptor.

07:53.042 --> 07:55.583
-Uh...
-As you've seen, it's done wonders for me.

07:55.667 --> 08:00.208
Come in, Eruptor...
and let the healing begin.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.667
Uh, what are you writing?
I didn't do anything.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.167
I see.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.792
You're doing it again!
I'm just sitting here!

08:20.875 --> 08:22.667
Mmm-hmm.

08:22.750 --> 08:26.042
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!
I don't need your help!

08:26.125 --> 08:27.625
Right.

08:31.833 --> 08:34.207
So, about your anger issues...

08:34.292 --> 08:36.542
I do not have...

08:40.125 --> 08:43.957
Fine! Whatever!
Let's just get this over with!

08:49.208 --> 08:50.708
Flowers make me angry.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.375
Birthdays make me angry.

08:55.875 --> 08:58.292
You don't wanna know.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.042
Annoying balloon.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.583
Annoying shell. Annoying clouds.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.417
Slightly annoying baby.

09:10.125 --> 09:15.000
All I wanted
was a hug every now and again.

09:15.083 --> 09:18.375
A kind word would've done wonders.

09:18.458 --> 09:23.875
Was that so much
to ask for, Nana?

09:59.083 --> 10:04.750
The ocean!
That makes me feel so calm.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.625
Birthday cake!

10:07.708 --> 10:10.333
It's happiness covered with icing!

10:11.083 --> 10:12.542
And this?

10:16.500 --> 10:17.917
Well, it doesn't make me feel

10:18.000 --> 10:20.833
like melting down the academy,
if that means anything.

10:21.542 --> 10:24.375
It means... progress!

10:24.458 --> 10:25.792
Oh.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.500
So, Hugo has really helped
with your anger issues, eh?

10:30.583 --> 10:33.542
Yep! Working with him has
done wonders for my disposition.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.625
I'm in a really good place, you guys!

10:36.708 --> 10:38.292
Aw! That's awesome, Eruptor!

10:38.375 --> 10:41.458
So what's the next step for you to
maintain the calm and collected new you?

10:41.542 --> 10:43.333
Hugo says the key is to keep cool,

10:43.417 --> 10:47.000
so I just need to stay away
from all the stuff that burns me up.

10:47.083 --> 10:50.792
Talk radio, Internet comment sections,
spicy food--

10:50.875 --> 10:53.958
Aw! Spicy food?
Bummer for you, dude!

10:54.042 --> 10:56.917
Yeah. It looks like I'm gonna
have to sit out this year.

10:57.917 --> 10:59.833
What? But you're our anchor!

10:59.917 --> 11:03.042
How are we supposed to remain
Chili Chomp Champs without you?

11:03.125 --> 11:05.208
Guys, I think Eruptor's
emotional well-being

11:05.292 --> 11:09.208
is slightly more important than
winning a chili-eating competition.

11:09.292 --> 11:11.917
-Aw, thanks, Elfy!
-I said slightly!

11:12.000 --> 11:13.292
Hey, even down a man,

11:13.375 --> 11:16.125
I'm sure we can still eat more chili
than any other team in the Skylands!

11:16.208 --> 11:18.792
Oh, yeah! Especially since
we all drank my potion

11:18.875 --> 11:22.208
that will keep us hungry
way past any reasonable point of fullness!

11:22.292 --> 11:24.375
Uh, that doesn't sound healthy...

11:24.458 --> 11:25.792
Oh, it is not!

11:25.875 --> 11:30.167
Whoo-hoo! This here may just be the best
evil plot I done ever come up with.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.292
And these disguises
are working perfectly!

11:33.125 --> 11:35.125
None of those Skylosers recognize us!

11:37.917 --> 11:40.667
Wow! Fresh produce
really does improve everything.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.625
Just need to add a skosh more
of my time-release ingredient

11:47.708 --> 11:51.417
so my evil chili
hits everyone at the same time!

11:51.500 --> 11:56.250
Then we can use your burrito bombs
to blow Skylander Academy sky high!

11:56.333 --> 12:00.458
Or, you know, whatever is higher than that
since we're already in the sky.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.958
Uh, space high?
No, no, that doesn't sound ominous.

12:03.042 --> 12:04.042
I digress!

12:04.125 --> 12:06.667
Now, are you sure these fools
will take the lethal bait?

12:06.750 --> 12:10.583
Kaos, I done seen a Skylander
do a fair number of things,

12:10.667 --> 12:14.042
but ain't one of them
ever turn down free chili!

12:15.000 --> 12:17.125
Now, I know most of you
only sign up

12:17.208 --> 12:20.667
for the Academy's Semi-Bi-Annual
Chili Chomp for the free chili.

12:20.750 --> 12:24.125
Yeah, we've been starving ourselves
for a week to prepare for this!

12:24.208 --> 12:25.333
Right, Skull?

12:25.417 --> 12:26.417
Sure.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.292
You guys know
I don't really eat, right?

12:29.375 --> 12:33.208
But, remember, there are also
bragging rights to be had.

12:33.292 --> 12:37.333
And with our reigning
Chili Chomp Champs down a member...

12:37.417 --> 12:41.917
I'm investing in the foundation
of the temple that is me.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
...now is the best shot
for a new team to take the title!

12:46.083 --> 12:47.542
Good luck with that!

12:47.625 --> 12:49.792
Yeah! Because we're cheating!

12:49.875 --> 12:51.625
- What?
- In addition,

12:51.708 --> 12:55.292
this year's winning team
will receive a lifetime supply of chili

12:55.375 --> 12:57.083
from our new sponsor...

12:58.792 --> 13:01.167
We're The Bad Guys Chili Company.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.375
Oh. Wait, sorry.

13:03.458 --> 13:06.000
We're Not The Bad Guys Chili Company.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.500
Hmm. I actually liked "Bad Guys."

13:08.583 --> 13:10.667
Kind of makes the chili
seem dangerous. Ooh!

13:10.750 --> 13:12.542
Oh, you got no idea!

13:12.625 --> 13:14.250
I feel like that comment
should make us suspicious,

13:14.333 --> 13:16.833
but honestly, I just can't wait
to start eating chili!

13:18.958 --> 13:20.875
Chili Chompers, ready?

13:21.917 --> 13:23.500
Chomp!

13:30.250 --> 13:31.417
All this chili is making me hungry.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.417
I guess as the judge of this competition,

13:33.500 --> 13:36.958
it would behoove me to at least try
some of this free-flowing goodness.

13:37.042 --> 13:40.625
Never fear, Master Eon.
We have enough for everybody!

13:40.708 --> 13:43.917
Delightful. Chili me up,
my good whatever-you-are!

13:44.000 --> 13:45.833
Mmm-mmm!

13:45.917 --> 13:50.000
I cannot get enough of this chili! Mmm.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.375
Oh! So good!

13:52.458 --> 13:54.250
Hey, guys, we're all
still on the lookout

13:54.333 --> 13:56.875
for anything out of the ordinary,
right?

13:56.958 --> 13:58.542
Totally.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.542
I really shouldn't.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.583
But it's free!

14:03.667 --> 14:07.792
Well, I...
I suppose I shouldn't let it go to waste.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.375
Are you sure
you want to do that?

14:11.125 --> 14:15.083
It'd be a shame to backtrack
after all your hard work.

14:15.167 --> 14:18.042
But it all looks so good.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.208
Let's get you out of here.

14:20.292 --> 14:24.042
Okay, okay.

14:26.958 --> 14:28.250
Excuse me.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.750
Uh, does anyone else's
tummy feel weird?

14:32.958 --> 14:34.750
I feel weird that
you used the word "tummy."

14:36.917 --> 14:39.000
Uh, guys, we are totally not
going to win if you--

14:41.500 --> 14:43.667
If we, you...

14:43.750 --> 14:47.292
Well, of course not,
that's just common sense.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.542
What is happening?

14:53.458 --> 14:55.167
Isn't it obvious?

14:56.083 --> 14:57.375
Pepper Jack and...

14:58.542 --> 14:59.583
Kaos?

14:59.667 --> 15:03.292
-Bingo, beardo!
-That's right, wizard man.

15:03.375 --> 15:10.250
And we've just done incapacitated
your entire Skylanders Academy!

15:10.333 --> 15:12.500
Hope you don't mind
if we just let ourselves in,

15:12.583 --> 15:14.708
plant some bombs,
and blow you all into oblivion!

15:14.792 --> 15:19.500
You know that I do... mind...
so why even ask that?

15:31.500 --> 15:35.500
My insides are burning,
and I still want more!

15:35.583 --> 15:37.375
Oh, my hernia!

15:41.667 --> 15:45.083
What... is wrong with you?

15:45.167 --> 15:49.667
Kaos and Pepper Jack used that...
...chili to take us all out!

15:49.750 --> 15:53.667
I know. But it's still... free!

16:01.000 --> 16:02.083
Right.

16:03.208 --> 16:04.333
Okay.

16:04.417 --> 16:07.917
I guess I just needed...
...the visual.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.875
I think this is the end
of our Chili Chomps.

16:12.958 --> 16:16.458
And... ...the Skylanders, too?

16:16.542 --> 16:19.917
I'm afraid... ...yes.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.500
Wait! Not all of us!

16:23.708 --> 16:26.167
Thanks for pulling me
out of there, Hugo.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.583
The temptation to heat up
was just a little too much.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.083
We're all tempted from time to time.

16:32.167 --> 16:35.917
The important thing is that you were
able to remain calm and balanced,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.875
and resist the urge to give in.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.708
Yeah, this is a lot harder

16:40.792 --> 16:42.208
than I thought it'd be.

16:43.458 --> 16:46.625
I know, the team is
counting on me to stay cool,

16:46.708 --> 16:48.125
but I gotta be honest.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.125
I feel like I'm being forced
to be someone I'm not.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.708
Yeah, you're probably right.

16:54.792 --> 16:57.208
Everyone just wants what's best for me,

16:57.292 --> 16:58.958
and as hard as it is,

16:59.042 --> 17:02.125
I really do feel better
not erupting all the time.

17:02.208 --> 17:05.625
Just like Eon said, I feel balanced.

17:06.833 --> 17:08.125
Oh, you're right, Hugo.

17:08.208 --> 17:11.916
I should go thank him and the whole team
for helping me right now.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.708
And thank you, buddy.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.958
What the... What's happening?

17:27.416 --> 17:30.417
Eruptor...
Oh, my God!

17:30.500 --> 17:34.833
Kaos and...
Pepper Jack used the chili to defeat us.

17:34.917 --> 17:39.083
And now they've gone to...
...blow up the academy!

17:39.167 --> 17:41.667
You're our only hope, pal!

17:41.750 --> 17:44.583
You gotta tap into your lava power
and stop them!

17:44.667 --> 17:46.792
You want me to erupt?

17:46.875 --> 17:51.125
Well, then I guess I'll just...
have... to...

17:51.208 --> 17:52.750
remind you all that you're the ones

17:52.833 --> 17:56.083
who asked me to get
anger management therapy, and honestly,

17:56.167 --> 17:59.333
I feel much better
not being mad all the time.

17:59.417 --> 18:02.625
But I will definitely find
those two so-and-so's

18:02.708 --> 18:05.625
and give them a stern talking-to.

18:08.792 --> 18:11.208
Ah, you know, before therapy,

18:11.292 --> 18:13.625
this kind of thing would have
really set me off.

18:16.208 --> 18:18.875
Eruptor, you must channel your anger.

18:18.958 --> 18:23.875
Harness its furious power
to stop Kaos and Pepper Jack!

18:23.958 --> 18:26.792
But what about balance? Harmony?

18:26.875 --> 18:29.708
Being in control
of one's self at all times?

18:29.792 --> 18:31.667
Totally. Still believe in all that.

18:31.750 --> 18:36.417
But right now, I need you
to tip the scales to your ragey side.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.750
-Big time!
-I... I don't know if I can.

18:38.833 --> 18:40.542
We do, buddy!

18:40.625 --> 18:42.917
You're our only hope, Eruptor!

18:43.000 --> 18:47.542
Also, I'm the one
who keeps eating your favorite cereal

18:47.625 --> 18:49.583
and leaving the box empty!

18:49.667 --> 18:51.500
You mean it wasn't a ghost?

19:01.250 --> 19:03.333
Rage, buddy.

19:03.417 --> 19:06.833
Rage... for all... Skylands.

19:08.542 --> 19:12.375
You sure did a number on all the
Skylanders' insides today, Pepper Jack!

19:12.458 --> 19:13.500
Well done!

19:13.583 --> 19:16.292
Well, unless you want me to do
a number on your outsides,

19:16.375 --> 19:19.042
I suggest we get ready
to make a run for it!

19:19.125 --> 19:20.917
My burrito bombs are fixing to blow!

19:23.583 --> 19:24.625
Excellent!

19:24.708 --> 19:30.625
Just a few more seconds
and Skylander Academy will be no more!

19:32.625 --> 19:35.000
One... two...

19:41.750 --> 19:43.500
Stop right there!

19:43.583 --> 19:46.792
Now that I've got the full firepower
of my lava back,

19:46.875 --> 19:49.417
you're not blowing up anything else!

19:49.500 --> 19:53.708
Stomachs, academies, anything!

19:53.792 --> 19:54.917
Um...

19:58.042 --> 19:59.083
Oh, magma.

20:15.250 --> 20:19.208
Well, I guess there's only one thing
I can do to save the academy.

20:34.083 --> 20:37.250
Oh, no! Eruptor! Is he...

20:38.708 --> 20:41.708
I'm good.
Just give me a second here.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.083
Air hug, guys.
I'm still pretty hot!

20:49.167 --> 20:50.583
- Oh, buddy!
- You did it!

20:50.667 --> 20:52.667
I lava you, man!

20:52.750 --> 20:55.042
I'm so proud of you, Eruptor.

20:55.125 --> 20:59.208
You dug deep to find your fire within
and saved us all.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.708
Thanks, Eon.

21:00.792 --> 21:01.917
And it's strange,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
that even though I totally
raged out like my old self,

21:05.083 --> 21:07.167
I still feel centered.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.292
Even happy.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.667
Then my work here is done.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.958
Hugo! You doing okay, buddy?

21:13.042 --> 21:15.250
Oh, it was a little
touch-and-go there for a minute,

21:15.333 --> 21:17.083
but I think the worst has passed.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.833
And everybody else is okay, too?

21:18.917 --> 21:20.000
Seems like it.

21:20.083 --> 21:23.083
But we better get back out to the quad
and make sure no one eats any more!

21:23.167 --> 21:26.167
- Good idea, Jet-Vac!
- Pop Fizz, no!

21:26.250 --> 21:28.625
What? Someone just left
the bowl sitting here.

21:28.708 --> 21:32.042
I mean... Mmm! You just
don't let chili this good go to--

21:39.083 --> 21:42.042
- I kind of feel like he deserved that.
- Ow!
