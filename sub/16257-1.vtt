celebrate May Day.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.758
lt's a big festival every year.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.135
So basically it brings them
good Iuck for the summer.

05:45.303 --> 05:49.097
And it's pretty much just an excuse
for the IocaIs to get wasted.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.475
lsn't it a pagan tradition?

05:51.642 --> 05:54.519
I guess we're gonna party

05:54.687 --> 05:56.229

Iike a pagan tonight.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.939

06:06.741 --> 06:09.284
You sound Iike Renee.
That's what she always says--

06:09.452 --> 06:11.995
she's so smart and interesting
and fun.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.122
And maybe she is,
but what a load, man.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.125
- Renee: What?
- Where are the bags?

06:17.293 --> 06:19.503
Where are the bags?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.380
You said you were gonna
get the bags, remember?

06:21.547 --> 06:23.340
Jenna: Wait, did we leave them
down there?

06:23.508 --> 06:25.175
No, no, they're up
at the cabin already.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.135
Wade got them.
This is his boat.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.303
Who's Wade?

06:28.471 --> 06:32.182
Wade is a giant, beastly man
whom I Iove.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.184
That's actually Wade
up there.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.978
- What's up, Wade?
- Michael: What's up, Wade?

06:37.146 --> 06:38.355
Come on up.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.399

- He's the reason why we're here.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.234
- ( camera shutter clicks )
- How so?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.070
He's my uncIe.
He rents out this cabin every year.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.656
And he decided to let us have it
during May Day.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.324
So we got hooked up.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.827
Oh, man, remember that weed
he gave us Iast summer?

06:51.994 --> 06:53.995

07:08.177 --> 07:10.679
So l hope you like to dance.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.514
Do you smoke?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.516
Do l smoke?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.518
Every now and then.
Not really,

07:16.686 --> 07:18.812
although Wade likes to think
everyone does.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.696
- Big Wade, what's up, man?

07:27.864 --> 07:29.030

09:50.256 --> 09:51.673
Renee:
This is really beautiful.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.509

09:56.262 --> 09:58.346

( Renee yelps, laughs )
Hey!

10:35.343 --> 10:37.427
You know, you can take
the bedroom.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.221
No, that's okay. This is the most
comfortable couch in the world.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.474
- ( Jenna giggles )
- ( door Iocks )

10:42.642 --> 10:45.435
Oh, God.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.063
lndeed, yeah.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.565

10:55.529 --> 10:57.072
( classical music playing )

10:57.239 --> 10:59.199
- Can l get you a beer?
- PIease.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.659
Cool.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.539
( sighs )

11:21.389 --> 11:24.391
All right, well, l guess

11:24.558 --> 11:27.936
you can watch me make dinner.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.564
No, but l will help.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.942
Even better.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.945
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.280
- ( classical music playing )
- ( moaning )

12:04.724 --> 12:08.017
( laughing, chattering )

12:09.645 --> 12:11.521
So why an English degree?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.898
'Cause he likes poverty.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.567
l don't see you making
six figures.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.485
Oh, good job.
'Cause l don't have to.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.863
Renee is bringing home all the big
bucks. Ain't that right, baby?

12:20.030 --> 12:22.282
She's wearing the pants too,
if you're cool with that.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.702
Mm-hmm, just so l can
take them off.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.248
No, seriously, why?

12:30.416 --> 12:33.585
l don't know. l always had
a fascination with literature.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.171
And l've always loved to write.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.757
l started off in the sciences,

12:38.924 --> 12:41.509
but that just didn't feel like
the right direction for me.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.011
- Sciences?
- Yeah.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.513
- He was a physics major.
- Physics? Really?

12:45.681 --> 12:48.183
- Stuff that only God should know.
- ( chuckles )

12:48.350 --> 12:51.394
Yeah, stuff that only God
shouId know.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.646
So what are you gonna do--
teach?

12:53.814 --> 12:55.356
No, l don't think
I want to teach.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.358
l want to reach
a wider audience than that.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.444
Writing for publication
was my major

12:59.612 --> 13:01.529
and communication
was my minor.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.406
So writing?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.492
Bingo.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.202
True poverty.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.870
Thank you.
Thank you for your support.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.790
l'm gonna make it a long way
with all of this support.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.542
Anytime, man.
Good luck with that.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.337
I keep teIIing Ian he needs
to move up here and work with me.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.381
Life's a vacation
and you get paid for it.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.425
lt's true.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.553
Wade, you can count me in.
Cheers to that.

13:25.721 --> 13:28.264
You know, in no way
do l mean to offend you,

13:28.432 --> 13:30.266
because l love you,

13:30.434 --> 13:34.395
but I just feeI Iike I'm meant
for something more, you know,

13:34.563 --> 13:36.773
something with more significance,
something with weight,

13:36.941 --> 13:38.817
something that matters.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.070
WeII, I think having fun
and making people happy--

13:42.238 --> 13:44.864
that's what matters, right?

13:45.032 --> 13:47.575
Ian:
Fair enough.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.288
( frogs croaking )

14:02.758 --> 14:04.759
Hey, Beau.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.847
Are you lonely out here?

14:12.643 --> 14:14.644
What are you looking at?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.281
Oh, man.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.950
Thanks.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.036
Good boy.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.789
Look how cute you are.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.792
So what do you think?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.711
What?

14:39.879 --> 14:43.339
About all this--
the food, the fun, the cabin.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.466
lt's not very often that you
go out of your comfort zone.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.468
l just want to make sure
that you're having fun.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.305
No, it's good.
l'm having a really great time.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.515
- So let's go.
- Okay.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.476
( both laughing )

14:55.644 --> 14:58.771
Now, that's what l like to see--
friends having fun.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.982
Make sure you take
your camera tonight,

15:01.150 --> 15:02.483
'cause there's gonna be fireworks.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.360
Oh, and don't forget
your invitations,

15:04.528 --> 15:06.321
'cause they won't Iet you
in the party without them.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.239
Okay. Thank you
for getting us the invitations.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.866
- No probIem.
- Aren't you gonna be there?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.452
You might not see me,
but l'll be there.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.329
- Good night.
- What, are you leaving already?

15:14.496 --> 15:17.165
WeII, I'II be back.
l gotta go set some things up.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.001
- Come on, Beau.
- Bye. Good night.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.379
Beau, will you stop flirting
with the girls? Come on, Beau.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.924
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:32.139 --> 15:35.183
Hey, I found one of those--
what do you call those things?

15:35.351 --> 15:37.685
- Steam rooms?
- Ah, the sauna.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.104
Michael: Oh, man,
we gotta do that.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.773
Have to do what?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.816
Go in the sauna.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.860
- Renee: Mm.
- Michael: Why not?

15:46.028 --> 15:47.904
lan: Yeah, l think
you'II Iike it.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.782
Renee: l don't know.
lt just doesn't sound too party-ish.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.118
Michael: Party-ish?
l don't think that's a word.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.703
What do you think, lan?

15:55.871 --> 15:58.414
Ian: I don't know.
l think it sounds kind of word-ish.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.667
Screw you, guys.
You know what l meant.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.795
Ian, what about the party?
l mean, don't we have to get ready?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.922
- Yeah.
- What did Wade say?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.632
He said we had
plenty of time, right?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.676
lan: Yeah, l think it'll be fine,
you know,

16:09.843 --> 16:12.720
give us a chance
to relax a little bit.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.723
AII right, weII, you know
how to work the thing, right?

16:15.891 --> 16:18.559
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, l'm gonna go change.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.144
- l'll turn it on.
- Okay.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.146
Go get in your underwear.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.565
What do you say, Jenna?
Yeah?

16:31.824 --> 16:33.449
What are you thinking?

16:33.617 --> 16:35.618
l don't know.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.745
- l mean, l just don't--
- ( footsteps )

16:37.913 --> 16:41.207
- ( Renee chuckles )
- What are you looking at?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.755
Hurry up.

16:50.676 --> 16:54.137
Anyway, l just--
l don't want you

16:54.304 --> 16:56.097
to, Iike, do anything
you're uncomfortable doing.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.308
l don't want you to, like,
feel like you have to, so...

16:59.476 --> 17:01.602
No, it's okay.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.606
Just give me a few minutes.
l'll go upstairs and get ready.

17:05.773 --> 17:08.192
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.361
Okay.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.990
( distant dogs barking )

18:04.833 --> 18:28.564
( exhales )

18:33.237 --> 18:34.487
Ooh.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.866
lt's hot.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.166
- lt's hot in here.
- lt's hot in here.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.210
lt's nice.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.712
Michael: Oh, man.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.715
Oh, man, here.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.176
You need to catch up.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.137
I don't know
if that's possible, even.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.889
- A pretty fast pace right here.
- ( Michael laughs )

19:02.057 --> 19:04.058
Oh, man.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.630
Hello, boys.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.258
- Michael: There she is.
- ( Ian whistIes )

19:37.426 --> 19:40.261
Ooh. Wow, this is
something, huh?

19:40.429 --> 19:42.680
- Damn.
- Scoot over.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.433
Lucky man.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.102
- Yeah, round two pretty soon.
- Stop it.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.480
You look hot.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.691
Where's Jenna?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.776
She's coming.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.835
l'll go get her.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.298
Go get her, cowboy.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.888
Oh, there she is.
Where are you headed?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.933
Nowhere. l was just
looking around.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.228
You know, it's really
ragged and rustic.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.189
Yeah, this place is great.
Come on.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.342
( slams )

21:11.311 --> 21:13.980
Ian:
Take a seat.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.274
Sit down. Get comfy.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.698
You know, l just brought
two waters.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.283
- Let me go--
- No, no, that's fine.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.952
We're fine. We've got drinks.
We'll go out and get some later.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.996
Michael:
I'm fine.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.540
Whoo-hoo!
( chuckles )

21:32.708 --> 21:34.875
Give me one of those waters.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.420
Ooh, thanks.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.304
I think this is the first time
l've ever had beer in a sauna.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.475
So Wade built this?

21:51.643 --> 21:53.060
He did?

21:53.228 --> 21:55.438
Ian: Yeah. Yeah, this
and everything else here.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.274
He redid the whole place
when he got it.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.110
This is his Iatest
and most recent installment--

22:01.278 --> 22:04.530
a European sauna.
lt's nice.

22:04.698 --> 22:08.034
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.
- Mm-hmm.

22:08.201 --> 22:11.329
- Yeah, in a hot way.
- Hey-oh!

22:11.496 --> 22:13.247
Lame joke.

22:13.415 --> 22:16.375
Oh, yeah, coming from the girI
who coined the term "party-ish."

22:16.543 --> 22:18.794
Okay, that was funny.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.338
Yeah, l thought it was funny.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.673
Well, you'd have to think it's funny.
She's your girlfriend.

22:22.841 --> 22:26.093
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah, politics.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.979
lt's hot in here.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.607
184 degrees.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.776
- ReaIIy?
- lt's crazy hot.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.445
Yeah, it can get hotter too.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.449
- Checking out the rocks?
- Yeah.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.201
There's a lot of them.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.161
Those are the type of rocks
that you pour water on them

22:52.329 --> 22:54.205
- to get steam, right?
- Yep.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.290
lf you want steam.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.875
Do you want steam?

22:58.043 --> 23:00.169
No, this is fine.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.046
I'm sensing
that you want some steam.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.590
Okay.

23:04.758 --> 23:07.218
Why not make it hotter
than it already is, huh?

23:11.348 --> 23:13.349
Here we go.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.228
- ( sizzles )
- lan: Ooh.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.896
Renee:
Hey, that's cool.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.985
Some more.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.154
Ooh.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.410
That seems to be enough.

23:41.711 --> 23:44.171
Too bad we don't have any snow
to roll around in.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.006
Ha.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.864
You know, if you guys are hot,
we can always go jump in the lake.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.825
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.910
- You want to?
- Yeah.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.537
- Let's go.
- That actually sounds like a good idea.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.290
Ian: Wow, we are pathetic.
We lasted two minutes in here.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.333
Hey, l lasted longer
than you guys.

24:21.501 --> 24:24.128
- l was here first.
- 20 seconds.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.840
- Ooh, it's coId.
- lt's cold. lt's cold.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.342
- Oh, my feet are like icicles.
- Let's go.

24:30.510 --> 24:33.846
( laughing )

24:38.310 --> 24:40.227
Jenna:
Oh, my Gosh, it's cold.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.396
lt's cold!

24:43.899 --> 24:46.358
( shouting, laughing )

25:00.874 --> 25:02.416
Jenna: Wait, you mean,
like, go in the sauna again?

25:02.584 --> 25:04.293
lan: Yeah, it's the best way
to warm up.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.086
Jenna: l thought you just meant
come inside.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.130
lan: l'm telling you,
it'll warm you up.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.341
Renee: Yeah, come on,
let's go back in. l'm freezing.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.592
Jenna: Okay.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.260
lan: Drinks?

25:13.428 --> 25:15.387
- Renee: Yeah, get me a beer.
- Jenna: A water, pIease.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.556
Ian:
Beer coming right up.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.894
( both shivering )

25:26.691 --> 25:29.944
"Why don't you grab his dick?"
ReaIIy?

25:30.111 --> 25:32.821
She didn't seem to mind
when l said it, man.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.660
- Pour me a small one.
- A small one?

25:37.827 --> 25:40.204
- Yeah.
- Sure. There you go.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.956
- Okay, that's not a small one.
- ( Iaughs )

25:50.632 --> 25:52.633
Enjoying yourself?

25:54.302 --> 25:55.511
Yeah.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.555
Good.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.315
l don't know. There's something
about her I Iike.

26:08.483 --> 26:11.652
l think the thing you like about her
is that she was half-naked.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.321
That might have
something to do with it.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.365
l'm on another world, man.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.367
- To good times.
- To good times.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.292
( both exhale )

26:26.459 --> 26:29.003
Oh, this does not get
any better...

26:29.170 --> 26:31.338
- Ever.
- ...the drunker l get.

26:31.506 --> 26:34.967
- l'm on another world.
- ( coughing )

26:35.135 --> 26:37.678
We should probably
get back down.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.556
Yeah. Yeah.
l'm warning you.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.725
- She's a load, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.893
You'll see. You'll see.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.734
Michael, why do you drink
this much?

26:59.367 --> 27:01.368
Oh.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.830
That's a trick floor there.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.833
Renee: Can you just please slow it
down on the drinking, Michael?

27:42.911 --> 27:44.787
Oh, hey, Beau.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.122
How are you doing?

27:47.290 --> 27:49.625
Good boy. Good boy.

27:58.426 --> 27:59.885
Come on, let's go.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.888
Come on, Beau.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.940
( screaming )

28:17.654 --> 28:19.905
( laughing )

28:26.621 --> 28:29.123
( shivering )

28:29.290 --> 28:33.460
Oh, this is the herbal aromas
l was telling you about.

28:33.628 --> 28:37.256
We've got jasmine,
lavender, cinnamon.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.299
Do you want to do
some cinnamon? Yeah?

28:40.802 --> 28:43.303
- l'm freezing.
- l know it's cold, baby.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.973
- What are you guys doing?
- Some herbal aromas.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.058
You guys want to go
in there one more time?

28:48.226 --> 28:50.144
lt's the last time. lt's the last time.
Come on. Warm up.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.187
Not really.

28:52.355 --> 28:55.649
Oh, look, babe, listen.
Listen.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.318
- No. Ow.
- l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.654
- What?
- Look. Listen.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.906
Why don't we just
leave them alone?

29:03.074 --> 29:05.451
- No. You're drunk. Stop it.
- l'm not drunk.

29:05.618 --> 29:06.869
- Yes, you are.
- You're drunk.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.788
Let's get some of this.
Cinnamon was a good choice.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.461
Here we go.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.590
- Let's go upstairs.
- No, l don't want to.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.759
l am tired of taking
care of you. Stop.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.221
Whatever. You gotta go take care
of Jenna. l understand.

29:26.389 --> 29:28.390
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.067
( whistles )

29:40.862 --> 29:42.738
Where are you going,
MichaeI?

29:44.908 --> 29:47.493
Bathroom.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.078
You'd better not be
peeing on yourself out there.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.997
l'm not.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.253
He's probably just mad
because he didn't get what he wanted.

29:58.421 --> 30:00.297
Or he's just going
to the bathroom.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.383
Renee:
Or he's just drunk again.

30:03.551 --> 30:06.261
God, he's just turned into
such a dipwad.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.556
Like, l'm so sick of taking care
of him aII the time.

30:09.724 --> 30:12.518
What do you mean?
lt's the same old Michael.

30:12.685 --> 30:14.978
No, it is not the same oId MichaeI.
And how would you know anyway?

30:15.146 --> 30:16.563
You haven't been around
the Iast two years.

30:16.731 --> 30:19.274
He's changed.
He's just-- he's completely different.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.401
l don't know.
l don't know if people change.

30:21.569 --> 30:24.238
l mean, not on the core level,
on a souI IeveI.

30:24.405 --> 30:27.282
l think we're all born
with an inherent wholeness.

30:27.450 --> 30:30.953
l think because of our
circumstances and situations,

30:31.120 --> 30:32.830
maybe we appear different
on the surface.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.289
Do you ever shut up?

30:34.457 --> 30:36.124
I'm just so sick
of taking care of everyone.

30:36.292 --> 30:40.254
- Yikes.
- ( objects crashing )

30:40.421 --> 30:42.339
See?

30:42.507 --> 30:45.384
Michael, what are you doing
out there?

30:45.552 --> 30:48.178
I am not babysitting
your drunk ass all night.

30:48.346 --> 30:51.390
I am going to that party
and l'm having a really good time.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.100
Do you hear me?

30:53.268 --> 30:55.060
Michael, l don't think you want
to upset her anymore.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.771
( thud )

30:59.983 --> 31:02.651
l'm gonna go get him.

31:04.612 --> 31:06.947
No, don't.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.907
He's just drunk

31:09.075 --> 31:12.411
and l'm sick of him
ruining everything again.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.663
He's just being a dick
because I didn't want

31:14.831 --> 31:16.957
to sneak off for another
drunken hump.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.960
Ugh. God, it's warm.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.799
God, it is just
the same thing all the time,

31:25.967 --> 31:28.468
like all the time.
I am sick of it.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.804
Renee, it's not that bad.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.640
No, it is. lt is.
It's just Iike

31:33.808 --> 31:35.350
it used to be fun,
but lately l--

31:35.518 --> 31:38.270
just everything-- l can't.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.355
God.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.692
Hey, let's just-- let's go.
We'II go upstairs.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.944
No, just give her
a few minutes.

31:46.112 --> 31:47.821
No, l want to go.
It's hot.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.365
- l want to get out of here.
- Jenna: Okay.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.332
- What's the matter?
- l don't know.

32:04.339 --> 32:07.215
Well, maybe it's locked.
Just turn it.

32:07.383 --> 32:10.385
No, there's no lock.
Look.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.515
lt looks like
it wants to open.

32:15.683 --> 32:19.019
Maybe it's just swollen
from the heat, you know?

32:19.187 --> 32:21.480
No. l mean, this is made
for that, right?

32:24.192 --> 32:27.736
Okay, well, if it's not locked,
then it should open.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.864
- Just reIax.
- Don't tell me to relax. Open it.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.407
- Jenna, come on.
- Hey, take it easy.

32:32.575 --> 32:35.410
- lt's gonna be all right.
- Open it!

32:35.578 --> 32:36.787
Jenna, please.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.081
No, l am not going to be
stuck in here.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.124
- Okay, Jenna, stop it.
- l am not going to be stuck in here.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.669
Jenna.

32:43.836 --> 32:46.046
What is up with this
claustrophobic shit?

32:46.214 --> 32:47.589
What are you
talking about?

32:47.757 --> 32:50.217
Where did this come from?
You never used to be claustrophobic.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.761
Maybe l am not claustrophobic,
but this bothers me.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.805
- l cannot be stuck in here.
- Okay.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.890
You don't know what it was like
being trapped for so Iong.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.685
Fine. Look, did you take
your piII today?

32:59.852 --> 33:00.894
No.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.980
What the fuck
are you trying to do?

33:03.147 --> 33:04.648
l'm trying not to rely on them.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.274
Well, nice time
for self-improvement.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.985
l'm sorry.
How was l supposed to know

33:08.152 --> 33:09.361
that we were gonna
be trapped in here?

33:09.529 --> 33:12.781
Hey, we're not trapped.
It's okay.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.450
l'll get us out of here.
Just clear some space.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.287
( exhales )

33:33.761 --> 33:37.389
Michael! Michael!

33:37.557 --> 33:39.766
- What are you doing?
- lt's Michael. He locked us in here.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.393
- MichaeI!
- Why would he lock us in here?

33:41.561 --> 33:43.520
As a joke. Michael!

33:43.688 --> 33:45.439
No, even Michael wouldn't
play a joke like that.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.358
You don't think so? What about
all the stupid shit that he does?

33:48.526 --> 33:50.277
lt's all jokes.
MichaeI!

33:50.445 --> 33:52.612
He does do a lot
of stupid shit.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.157
- Michael!
- Michael!

33:55.324 --> 33:57.034
lan:
lt's not funny anymore!

33:57.201 --> 33:59.494
lt's hilarious.
We're all laughing.

33:59.662 --> 34:01.538
Renee:
Michael!

34:01.706 --> 34:03.331
( coughing )

34:03.499 --> 34:05.125
Renee, slow down.
Slow down.

34:05.293 --> 34:09.963
If he Iocked us in here,
l'm certain he'll let us out.

34:10.130 --> 34:12.299
Besides, he's got the attention span
of a three-year-oId.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.342
He will get bored,
believe me.

34:14.510 --> 34:17.054
This isn't good for us in here.
It's not good for our hearts.

34:17.221 --> 34:20.139
Just-- just save your energy.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.143
Just drink some water.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.978
He'll let us out.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.358
lf it's a joke,
he'll let us out.

34:30.525 --> 34:32.360
This is a joke? Really?

34:32.527 --> 34:34.487
l'm not saying
it's a good one.

34:34.655 --> 34:37.449
Look, let's just relax.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.743
No, l don't want to relax.
l want to get the hell out of here.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.703
- Michael! l'm hot.
- Renee.

34:41.871 --> 34:44.498
- And l have a headache. Michael!
- Renee.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.751
l'm hot and l have a headache.
Let us out!

34:47.918 --> 34:51.463
- Michael!
- Renee, Renee, look, sit down.

34:51.630 --> 34:53.340
You're dehydrated.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.675
He's gonna let us out.

34:55.842 --> 34:58.053
Get some water.
You're really dehydrated.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.639
Just-- look, he'll let us out.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.433
Believe me,
he's not that cruel.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.105
- What if he forgets?
- He's not gonna forget.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.482
Renee: What if drunken Mike
starts playing Firefighter?

35:10.650 --> 35:12.442
We'll be in here all night.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.694
Wade-- Wade gave him weed.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.446
l mean, just a joint, but--

35:16.614 --> 35:18.865
Wade? And you want me to wait
in here for him?

35:19.033 --> 35:20.909
That idiot is somewhere

35:21.077 --> 35:23.453
stupid and stoned and drunk.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.038
And meanwhiIe,
you know very well

35:25.206 --> 35:27.374
that this little joke
could be an all-night thing.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.258
l mean-- l mean,
somebody will come back.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.635
l mean, Wade--
Wade will come back.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.389
What?

35:42.557 --> 35:44.850
He's not gonna come back.

35:45.017 --> 35:47.853
l mean, at least
not for a while.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.021
Wait, why wouldn't Wade
come back?

35:50.189 --> 35:53.733
Why would he come back?
He thinks we're gonna be at the party.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.278
Look, look, this isn't that bad.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.487
( laughs )

35:57.655 --> 35:59.906
Look, let's just burn off
some extra caIories.

36:00.074 --> 36:03.368
lf we can figure out
why the door won't open,

36:03.536 --> 36:05.704
we can figure out
how to open it.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.081
Right? Simple logic.

36:13.462 --> 36:16.423
- Shit.
- What?

36:16.591 --> 36:18.758
What is it? What is it?
Let me see.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.013
What is that?

36:23.181 --> 36:25.932
l can't tell. Looks like
something's blocking the door.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.768
Let us out, Michael!
Michael!

36:28.936 --> 36:31.396
Let us out.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.272
Michael!

36:33.107 --> 36:35.108
( truck engine running )

36:37.028 --> 36:39.613
( engine stops )

36:39.780 --> 36:41.823
( Wade groans )

36:43.034 --> 36:44.576
Man:
Well, it's about time.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.411
Wade: And a happy May Day
to you, too.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.955
You want to deal with this
now or Iater?

36:49.123 --> 36:50.832
Man: Later.
Let's go check it out.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.125
Wade:
All right, man.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.627
Man: How are those renters
of yours?

36:53.794 --> 36:56.504
Wade: They're having a high old time,
courtesy of old Uncle Wade.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.548
- Man: Yeah?
- Yep.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.967
Man: Well, we're gonna have
a good time tonight, man.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.803
What are we gonna do?

37:05.431 --> 37:08.016
l'm not sure.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.310
l don't know,
but we'll figure it out.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.645
Break the window.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.855
No, Iet's not start
breaking things just yet.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.650
We can't stay in here.
We're gonna suffocate or something.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.526
It's too hot.
l can't breathe.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.987
We're not gonna suffocate.
We have pIenty of air.

37:21.155 --> 37:22.989
lt's the heat that we
have to worry about.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.158
That's why I said
let's just take it easy,

37:25.326 --> 37:27.452
drink plenty of water,
even if it's warm.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.412
Yeah, he's right.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.915
A person can only stay
in here for so long

37:32.083 --> 37:34.167
before suffering heat stroke.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.336
Heat stroke?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.171
What's that?
What's heat stroke?

37:38.339 --> 37:40.340
We'II be out of here
before that even happens.

37:40.508 --> 37:44.010
No, no, no, tell me what happens.
What happens?

37:44.178 --> 37:46.471
Tell me.

37:46.639 --> 37:50.684
lt's when your body stops
trying to cool itself off.

37:50.851 --> 37:54.521
You-- you get dizzy.
You get headaches.

37:54.689 --> 37:58.149
You vomit.
You pass out.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.693
- Die?
- No. No, no, no.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.027
- We're gonna die?
- We're not gonna die.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.570
No, we're not gonna die.
That's not gonna happen.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.156
Okay, well, for God's sake, l mean,
I'm not gonna die in here.

38:05.324 --> 38:07.742
We're gonna get out of here,
trust me.

38:07.910 --> 38:11.037
Can you just turn it off?
Can you just turn it off now?

38:11.205 --> 38:14.291
If that were a possibiIity, don't you
think l would have done that by now?

38:14.458 --> 38:16.751
- The controls are outside.
- Why? That's stupid.

38:16.919 --> 38:19.254
- l don't know. So they don't corrode.
- That's stupid. It's not safe.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.382
- There's gotta be something in here.
- I've never seen anything eIse.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.010
This isn't like a gym
or a hotel.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.761
lt's not idiot-proof.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.806
Well, then you shouldn't have
Iet MichaeI anywhere near it.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.683
l--

38:32.685 --> 38:34.102
Oh, that's just a thermometer.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.521
But behind it?

38:41.110 --> 38:44.404
Oh, no, that's just the--

38:44.572 --> 38:46.364
the thermostat, but--

38:46.532 --> 38:47.741
But what?

38:47.908 --> 38:49.492
lt's different.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.911
You know,
it looks electronic

38:52.079 --> 38:54.581
and it's covered
with plastic.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.875
- So?
- So l don't know.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.626
Yeah, but it's the thermostat,
right?

38:58.794 --> 39:01.796
Well, it's not like the thermostat that
you'd see on the wall in your house.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.840
l mean, there's no control on it.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.926
Like l said,
the control is outside.

39:08.262 --> 39:10.972
This is how it works:
you set the temperature outside,

39:11.140 --> 39:12.640
the heater runs.

39:12.808 --> 39:15.226
And when it gets to that temperature,
the heater turns off.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.897
This is the part that tells
the heater to turn off.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.566
l'm not sure that l want
to mess with this.

39:21.734 --> 39:22.942
Well, why not?

39:23.110 --> 39:24.903
( gas hisses )

39:25.071 --> 39:27.364
That's why not.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.532
Shit.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.744
What about this thing?

39:32.912 --> 39:35.663
The heater?

39:35.831 --> 39:38.124
No, don't touch it.
lt's gas.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.252
l don't want to fuck around
with gas.

39:41.420 --> 39:44.923
That's the last thing that we want
to be inhaling right now.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.349
- Michael! Michael!
- Renee.

39:54.517 --> 39:57.102
Michael!

40:05.986 --> 40:09.989
Michael! Michael!

40:12.701 --> 40:17.497
Michael!

40:43.190 --> 40:45.275
- Give me the bucket.
- What for?

40:45.443 --> 40:47.777
Just give me the bucket.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.696
- The water's gone.
- What?

40:49.864 --> 40:51.823
lt's fine. lt's fine.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.826
Hey, will you give me
those waters?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.878
- What are you gonna do?
- Break the window.

41:05.045 --> 41:06.212
Here.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.423
l thought you didn't want
to break it.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.216
Well...

41:10.384 --> 41:12.385
here.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.762
l don't know what else to do.
l think it will help.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.806
Renee: What about
five minutes ago?

41:16.974 --> 41:18.349
Here you go.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.895
Argh. Argh.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.355
Hurry up.

41:24.523 --> 41:26.399
- Hurry up.
- Hang on. lt has to cool.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.903
Come on, it's not gonna
get any cooler. lt's cool enough.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.322
Renee, l've burned my hand once.
Just Iet it cooI off.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.782
Okay, l can't take it anymore in here.
l have to get out of here.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.743
It is too hot.
l gotta get out of here.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.662
- l can't be in here any longer.
- It'II be aII right.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.456
lt's not getting any cooler.

41:46.587 --> 41:49.047
Watch out.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.466
Fuck.

41:57.598 --> 42:14.614
( grunting )

42:14.782 --> 42:15.949
Fuck!

42:29.004 --> 42:30.588
Oh, my God, air.

42:42.017 --> 42:45.311
- Renee: Michael!
- Jenna: MichaeI!

42:45.479 --> 42:47.313
Renee: Michael!

42:50.276 --> 42:52.360
lan: Michael!

42:53.362 --> 42:55.989
Renee: Michael!

42:56.156 --> 42:58.866
Fucking asshole.
Michael!

43:04.456 --> 43:07.584
Michael! Michael!

43:51.086 --> 43:53.421
( women panting )

43:55.299 --> 43:57.300
Renee: Mike!

44:04.600 --> 44:06.601
( gas hissing )

44:07.895 --> 44:10.104
lan:
Oh, damn.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.109
We can stop blaming Michael.

44:15.277 --> 44:16.694
Renee: Why?

44:16.862 --> 44:18.529
lan: Because he didn't
Iock us in here.

44:18.697 --> 44:23.368
There's a Iadder
that seems to be wedged

44:23.535 --> 44:25.578
between the doors.
lt must have fallen.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.081
Maybe that drunk ass
knocked it over.

44:28.248 --> 44:30.917
No, come on, Iet's give him
some credit. We don't know that.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.585
Right.

44:34.421 --> 44:36.381
Fucking asshole.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.132
You're an asshole, Michael!

44:38.300 --> 44:40.760
Hey, hey, save your energy.

44:42.054 --> 44:44.472
God, he's such an asshole.

44:48.227 --> 44:50.853
Yeah, well, what are we
gonna do?

44:52.439 --> 44:55.775
l don't know. lt seems to be
better than it was before.

44:55.943 --> 44:58.569
l mean, we got some fresh air
in here, right?

44:58.737 --> 45:00.613
- Yeah.
- l mean, that's--

45:00.781 --> 45:02.990
that's a vast improvement.

45:03.158 --> 45:04.450
This feels good.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.912
lan: l wouldn't do that
if I were you.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.541
Renee: l know. 'Cause it stinks.
FeeIs great.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.084
lt's just temporary relief.

45:13.252 --> 45:16.170
l don't care if it's just
temporary relief.

45:16.338 --> 45:19.173
Calm the fuck down.

45:19.341 --> 45:22.802
l'm just saying it's not gonna
do anything for the long run.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.971
Why not?

45:25.139 --> 45:28.224
Because you know how you said
that your body wasn't that hot earlier?

45:28.392 --> 45:30.601
- Yeah.
- Well, when you get that hot,

45:30.769 --> 45:32.937
your body tries
to protect itself.

45:33.105 --> 45:36.315
So your skin

45:36.483 --> 45:39.652
starts to collect sweat
and other stuff that insulates it.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.696
And right now
you're tricking your body

45:41.864 --> 45:43.740
to think it's cooler
than it is.

45:43.907 --> 45:46.534
I don't think
that's a good idea.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.038
lt's cooler in here anyway.

45:51.206 --> 45:53.833
We broke the window.
The cool air is coming in.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.502
- That's good.
- Yeah, but I--

45:58.338 --> 46:00.673
What?

46:03.135 --> 46:05.136
Let me see this.

46:06.805 --> 46:09.140
lt might seem cooler
right now,

46:09.308 --> 46:10.975
but I promise you
it's not gonna stay that way.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.895
That heater is gonna
turn back on.

46:14.062 --> 46:17.023
And-- fuckin'-A.
And it's gonna stay on.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.691
What? Why?

46:18.859 --> 46:21.986
Because it's gonna try to get
back up to that original temperature.

46:22.154 --> 46:24.989
And we had it set to 185 degrees.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.241
And since the window's broken,

46:27.409 --> 46:30.369
this thing-- it's never gonna
reach that temperature.

46:30.537 --> 46:34.207
So think of it like--

46:34.374 --> 46:36.292
like a convection oven

46:36.460 --> 46:39.253
rather than a steamer.
Watch out.

46:39.421 --> 46:42.048
Nice analogy. Thanks.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.927
Watch out.
Watch out.

47:10.035 --> 47:11.244
( grunts )

47:12.996 --> 47:14.997
Come on, bitch.

47:16.333 --> 47:19.752
Ah. Fuck. Fuck.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.463
Ah!

47:25.884 --> 47:28.469
Come on.

47:28.637 --> 47:30.972
( lan groans )

47:33.433 --> 47:43.776
Fuck.

47:43.944 --> 47:47.488
There's got to be a way
to turn this off.

47:50.742 --> 47:54.287
lf you can think of it,
you get the prize.

47:54.454 --> 47:55.830
Don't.

47:55.998 --> 47:58.791
Hey, don't fuck with that.

47:58.959 --> 48:00.459
lt's the only control we have.

48:00.627 --> 48:03.337
What do you mean, controI?
You said we couldn't turn it off.

48:03.505 --> 48:06.674
WeII, I'm teIIing you, we don't want
this thing running full blast, trust me.

48:06.842 --> 48:08.384
What's the difference?

48:08.552 --> 48:12.346
Deep-fried, slow-roasted--
what does it matter, huh?

48:12.514 --> 48:15.057
And how do you know that
this thing just won't turn off

48:15.225 --> 48:16.893
if we just break this thing?

48:17.060 --> 48:18.895
I'm not saying
that l know for certain.

48:19.062 --> 48:20.688
- See? I knew it.
- Renee, just don't.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.773
Look, I never said
that l knew it, all right?

48:22.941 --> 48:25.568
I'm just saying I know
what the worst could be.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.111
Oh, yeah? What's that?

48:27.279 --> 48:29.488
Well, this thing can get up to
about 250 degrees.

48:29.656 --> 48:31.490
Do you want to risk that?

48:32.701 --> 48:34.368
- Renee--
- You want your skin to fucking melt?

48:34.536 --> 48:36.412
Renee, just don't, okay?

48:36.580 --> 48:38.122
What, you're on his side now?

48:38.290 --> 48:39.874
No, l'm not taking any sides.

48:40.042 --> 48:44.295
l just don't think that we should do
anything that we don't have to do.

48:44.463 --> 48:47.089
That's typical Jenna--
let's just not do anything at all, hmm?

48:47.257 --> 48:48.883
What's the difference?

48:49.051 --> 48:50.301
Time.

48:50.469 --> 48:53.054
At Ieast that's what Ian's
telling us-- it'll give us time.

48:53.221 --> 48:56.057
Time? Time?
Time for what?

48:56.224 --> 48:57.767
l don't know.
To try to get out of here.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.644
To wait for somebody
to come.

48:59.811 --> 49:02.021
Wait for whom? MichaeI?
You know as damn well as l do

49:02.189 --> 49:04.065
he's passed out Iike
a fucking baby somewhere.

49:04.232 --> 49:05.900
Fuck.

49:06.068 --> 49:09.278
Maybe we'll wait for Wade
to come back.

49:09.446 --> 49:11.405
Wade is not coming back either.
Why wouId he come back?

49:11.573 --> 49:13.908
He thinks we're at the party.
No one is coming back for us.

49:14.076 --> 49:16.160
I am sick of waiting.
l want to get out of here now.

49:16.328 --> 49:18.663
- We all want to get out of here.
- Oh, you want to get out of here?

49:18.830 --> 49:20.998
You know, l have a life
to get back to.

49:27.089 --> 49:28.631
( coughs )

49:32.469 --> 49:39.100
Are you okay?

49:39.267 --> 49:41.268
Yeah, l'm fine.

49:49.778 --> 49:51.779
What is it?

50:12.300 --> 50:14.301
Renee:
What are you doing?

50:15.345 --> 50:18.014
Well, l think

50:18.181 --> 50:20.599
l can short out this light.

50:24.479 --> 50:27.606
You know, blow the fuse.

50:27.774 --> 50:29.775
Hopefully

50:29.943 --> 50:31.861
this is tied into
the heater controls.

50:32.029 --> 50:34.280
When the power turns off,

50:34.448 --> 50:37.158
the heater will turn off.

50:42.831 --> 50:45.499
Hey, will you hand me
that toweI?

50:47.169 --> 50:49.253
WouIdn't that just
leave us in the dark?

50:49.421 --> 50:51.505
Possibly.

50:51.673 --> 50:54.008
That's better than being
roasted to death.

51:16.865 --> 51:18.699
Hand me the bucket.

51:18.867 --> 51:21.035
- What?
- The bucket

51:21.203 --> 51:22.870
and the ladle.

51:23.038 --> 51:24.705
What are you
gonna do now?

51:26.708 --> 51:29.877
I'm gonna try to jam it
in the socket, blow it out.

51:35.884 --> 51:38.094
All right,

51:38.261 --> 51:40.387
here we go.

51:41.389 --> 51:43.557
All right, three,

51:43.725 --> 51:45.976
two,

51:46.144 --> 51:47.436
one.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.980
- ( electricity crackles )
- ( screaming )

51:52.109 --> 51:54.068
Renee: lan!

51:54.236 --> 51:56.695
( women panting )

51:56.863 --> 51:58.405
Are you okay?

52:00.117 --> 52:02.409
lan, lan, lan, lan.

52:02.577 --> 52:04.912
Oh, my God.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.960
Get a towel-- a towel.

52:18.468 --> 52:20.928
Come on, come on.

52:21.096 --> 52:23.139
- Fuck, it didn't work.
- Come on, get up. Get up.

52:23.306 --> 52:25.349
Get up.

52:27.727 --> 52:30.521
Good job, Beau.
Ajob well done, buddy.

52:30.689 --> 52:32.731
Go on. Go, go. Go on.

52:33.775 --> 52:35.860
Good boy.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.989
- All right, man, are you ready?
- Yeah.

52:40.157 --> 52:43.534
Wade: Let's do this.
Let's get this shit done.

52:44.870 --> 52:47.204
- And double-check the lines.
- Okay.

52:51.626 --> 52:53.794
Be careful. Be careful.

54:10.997 --> 54:13.624
We got two minutes, man.

54:13.792 --> 54:17.002
Maybe you should grab
the stuff, fire it up.

54:17.170 --> 54:18.921
Okay.

54:23.927 --> 54:26.345
( lan coughing )

54:30.267 --> 54:32.351
Jenna:
Why did you say that?

54:32.519 --> 54:34.144
Renee:
Say what?

54:34.312 --> 54:36.897
"l have a reason to live."

54:37.065 --> 54:39.400
l didn't mean it like that.

54:39.567 --> 54:41.819
l didn't mean it.

54:42.904 --> 54:45.322
Remember when we got them?

54:47.575 --> 54:50.995
Myrtle Beach, senior trip.

54:52.247 --> 54:54.957
lt was a really good time.

54:56.167 --> 54:58.085
Yeah.

54:58.253 --> 55:02.089
We used to spend
every second together,

55:02.257 --> 55:04.758
l mean, just us.

55:06.761 --> 55:09.930
We used to have so much fun,
laughing so hard.

55:11.933 --> 55:14.226
That was a long time ago.

55:16.396 --> 55:18.731
I know.
l was just saying.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.445
- Renee: Things change.
- ( Ian coughing )

55:24.612 --> 55:26.155
You have to grow up.

55:26.323 --> 55:29.700
You can't just sit around giggling
with your best friend all day.

55:31.453 --> 55:34.788
You don't even want to.

55:34.956 --> 55:37.666
At least that would make
a difference.

55:37.834 --> 55:40.502
( Renee crying )
Well, people change, too.

55:40.670 --> 55:43.964
And l am not the same person.

55:44.132 --> 55:47.843
And you are not
the same person.

55:48.011 --> 55:51.221
Jenna: You didn't even
give me a chance.

55:51.389 --> 55:53.724
Renee:
Jenna, it's been three years

55:53.892 --> 55:56.518
since the a--
since Jamie--

55:56.686 --> 55:58.979
it's been three years.

55:59.147 --> 56:01.648
And l tried.

56:01.816 --> 56:03.484
How many times
did I invite you?

56:03.651 --> 56:06.653
And how many times did you find
reasons to say no?

56:06.821 --> 56:09.907
Yeah, well, it's us.

56:11.326 --> 56:13.660
We're not just anybody.

56:15.121 --> 56:17.164
l mean, we grew up together.

56:18.708 --> 56:21.877
For God's sakes, Renee, l was gonna
ask you to be my maid of honor.

56:22.879 --> 56:25.756
Renee: What are you saying?
That l haven't been a good friend?

56:25.924 --> 56:27.841
That l shouldn't have been
your maid of honor?

56:28.009 --> 56:30.135
No, l'm not saying that.
l just--

56:30.303 --> 56:31.887
- lan: Shh.
- ( scraping )

56:32.055 --> 56:34.681
- What now?
- ( dog barking )

56:34.849 --> 56:36.558
l think l hear Beau.

56:36.726 --> 56:38.644
( Beau whining )

56:38.812 --> 56:40.979
( lan coughing )

56:41.147 --> 56:43.190
Beau.

56:43.358 --> 56:45.818
( Beau barking )

56:45.985 --> 56:47.945
Beau.

56:49.197 --> 56:51.031
- ( women pounding )
- Beau. Beau.

56:51.199 --> 56:52.866
lan: Beau.

56:53.034 --> 56:54.993
- Here, Beau.
- Beau.

56:55.161 --> 56:58.455
( all shouting )
Beau! Beau!

57:00.792 --> 57:02.626
Beau!

57:05.839 --> 57:07.548
Come on, Beau!

57:19.477 --> 57:21.854
( screaming, crying )

57:22.021 --> 57:24.773
PIease, God.
Let us out, Beau.

57:26.776 --> 57:28.318
Beau!

57:28.486 --> 57:31.905
PIease, God.
Let us out, Beau.

57:34.367 --> 57:36.577
lan: Wade!

57:36.744 --> 57:38.036
Wade!

57:38.204 --> 57:39.663
Renee:
Beau, please!

57:44.878 --> 57:47.087
Anybody!

57:47.255 --> 57:48.755
Somebody!

57:48.923 --> 57:51.842
- ( Beau continues barking )
- ( women whimpering )

57:58.183 --> 58:00.225
( lan coughing )

58:05.690 --> 58:08.066
You got your headset on?

58:12.322 --> 58:14.198

Beau, let's go.
We're going home.

01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:25.704

Wade, what's up, my man?
Hey, Beau.

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:46.433
What are you doing out here?

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.769
Yeah, so did l, man, so did l.

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:50.771
What do you mean?

01:00:50.938 --> 01:00:53.315
Well, they went to the party,

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.108
but they left me passed out
on the couch.

01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:57.152
- Didn't wake me up or nothing.
- ReaIIy?

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.488
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.032
But, man, that stuff
you gave me--

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.117
whoo! That shit
knocked me out, man.

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:06.244
That's good stuff.
l told you it would.

01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:09.122
That's some really good stuff, man.
l mean, one minute l was sitting there

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.832
having a smoke
and playing video games,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.585
next minute I was passed out
and your crazy dog was barking.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:16.630
Oh, dog, shut up.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:18.507
Yeah, I don't know
what's gotten into him.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.343
Must have been
the fireworks or something.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.306
- Yo, Ian.
- ( Beau barking )

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:28.600
Aw, shut up.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.603
God, dog,
shut the fuck up.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:41.488
Yo, lan.

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:49.079
Babe, are you upstairs?

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.842
Dog, shut up.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:07.139
Wade. Oh, Wade.

01:02:13.187 --> 01:02:15.188
So what are you doing now?

01:02:15.356 --> 01:02:18.150
Going back to the house,
I guess.

01:02:18.317 --> 01:02:20.318
Why don't you go back
to the party?

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:22.654
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Your invitation, pIease.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.698
No, not my thing.

01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:27.743
Security guards, invitations--
forget about it.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.786
l don't have it.
My friends are in the party.

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:31.371
- They have all the invitations.
- Call them.

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:34.082
l don't have my phone, so...

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.375
Call them.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:38.378
What, are you deaf, man?
l just told you l don't have my phone.

01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:40.881
Sir, this is a private party.

01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:43.383
Without your invitation,
there's nothing we can do for you.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.721
Don't fucking touch me, man.

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.097
You know what?
Forget it.

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.391
lf l had yourjob too,
l'd be an asshole.

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:53.226
Thanks

01:02:53.394 --> 01:02:54.895

Fuck you.

01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:01.902
God.

01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:04.321
I can't beIieve
they fucking left me.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.115
Well, why don't you come
hang out with me at the house?

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.701
l'm sure we can find
something to do.

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.244
l'm sure we can.

01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:13.747

01:03:17.668 --> 01:03:20.170
- Beau.
- Looks like he doesn't want to come.

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:22.506
Come on, Beau.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.801

01:03:43.694 --> 01:03:45.904
We need the water.

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:47.781
( bottle clatters )

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.118

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.500
We need water.

01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:04.965

Thank you.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.692
That's very helpful of you.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.490
Here. Here.

01:04:36.664 --> 01:04:39.457
Renee:
We have to get out of here.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:43.670
We can't be in here much longer.
We gotta find a way out of here.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:46.882
l can't wait anymore.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.675
Jenna:
What are we gonna do?

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:51.261

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:56.349
Ian:

Wait for Wade?
He's the fuck knows where.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.193
- And even the dog abandoned us.

01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:08.862
No, l am sick of waiting
for someone.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.114
l'm the one with the life

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:14.367
You're just poor, pathetic little Jenna

01:05:27.798 --> 01:05:29.049
Renee.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.056

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:09.506
She's-- she's clearly

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:11.549
But--

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:13.635
But she's bleeding.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.720
She's gonna be okay.

01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:18.098

She'll be fine.

01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:52.507
( Wade coughs )

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.884

Jenna, are you okay?

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.678
l didn't see what happened.

01:07:40.347 --> 01:07:43.308
I-- I was trying
to make her stop.

01:07:44.685 --> 01:07:47.604

You pulled her back twice.

01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:06.748
You made it seem like it was
