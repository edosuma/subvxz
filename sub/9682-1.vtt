03:16.000 --> 03:19.145
Straight through there and
to the left

03:45.584 --> 03:47.584
Would you like to...

04:05.239 --> 04:08.033
- Who's this?
- Pardon me?

04:09.004 --> 04:11.004
That's not my father.

04:14.001 --> 04:16.721
Shit, we've taken the wrong one.

04:16.899 --> 04:21.490
We're really sorry for this.
We'll go back and get him.

04:27.394 --> 04:29.394
Jesus...

04:52.813 --> 04:55.363
They brought the wrong coffin.

04:55.811 --> 04:57.811
You're joking.

04:58.809 --> 05:01.402
Can you believe that?
Good thing I checked.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.706
We could be running the service for
some random member of the public.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.238
What kind of business are these people
running anyway?

05:07.338 --> 05:08.704
My God.

05:08.804 --> 05:11.359
There's just so much to worry about
you know. And Mom's in such a state...

05:11.459 --> 05:13.653
Robert is clear he'll not do anything to
help, assuming he gets here at all.

05:13.753 --> 05:15.433
Even the funeral speech is awful.

05:15.533 --> 05:16.810
I'm sure it's not that awful.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.910
Yeah, it is.

05:19.298 --> 05:20.719
I was thinking that maybe Robert...

05:20.819 --> 05:22.222
..should write the speech.
He's such a good writer.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.296
Maybe we should
let him do it.

05:23.396 --> 05:26.378
You're every bit as good a writer as
your brother Daniel, if not better,...

05:26.478 --> 05:29.393
...you just have to let somebody
else read your novel.

05:29.493 --> 05:31.873
Everything is gonna be okay.

05:32.062 --> 05:33.742
When the funeral is over...

05:33.842 --> 05:36.063
...we just have to focus on
moving out of here...

05:36.163 --> 05:39.393
...and starting our own
lives properly.

05:42.306 --> 05:43.761
You called them?

05:43.861 --> 05:45.583
Didn't you, Daniel?

05:45.683 --> 05:47.549
You did put the deposit
on the flat?

05:47.649 --> 05:49.944
I'll sort it out.
I promise.

05:53.846 --> 05:56.159
God, I hate funerals.
Don't you?

05:56.259 --> 05:58.554
They're just so depressing.

05:58.770 --> 06:00.326
It's just the death and
everything...

06:00.426 --> 06:01.959
...know what I mean?
Do you agree, Justin?

06:02.059 --> 06:03.720
Justin?

06:03.820 --> 06:05.820
Yeah, it's alright

06:06.159 --> 06:10.003
Alright? How can you possibly think
of that as alright?

06:10.103 --> 06:13.034
Why are you even coming to this?
You don't even know Daniel.

06:13.134 --> 06:15.000
I do know Daniel.
I met him a couple of times.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.999
A couple of times. Well he's not
a friend, is he?

06:17.099 --> 06:18.598
No, not a friend.

06:18.698 --> 06:21.496
If you're gonna smoke will you please
put that out the window?

06:21.596 --> 06:24.694
I'd rather not get your cancer
thank you very much.

06:24.794 --> 06:27.326
I got my own problems to be
worrying about.

06:27.426 --> 06:28.826
Yeah, like what?

06:28.926 --> 06:32.428
The discoloration on my wrist
I keep telling you about.

06:32.528 --> 06:33.723
Look at it.

06:33.823 --> 06:35.189
It's fucked.

06:35.289 --> 06:37.289
I'm fucked.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.868
Why are we even coming, eh?

06:42.684 --> 06:44.979
Cause of Martha, isn't it?

06:47.215 --> 06:49.215
Justin...

06:51.046 --> 06:52.513
Are you okay?

06:52.613 --> 06:54.908
Not too bad, thanks Martha.

06:55.044 --> 06:57.044
I'm a bit nervous.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.409
About seeing my Dad?

06:58.509 --> 07:02.107
I just don't think I've been so
openly hated by anyone before.

07:02.207 --> 07:05.205
He just hates everyone.
You mustn't take it to heart.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.104
You need to relax with him.

07:07.204 --> 07:09.402
I can't help it.
He puts me on edge.

07:09.502 --> 07:11.450
He'll be more concerned his sister
husband just died.

07:11.550 --> 07:13.234
He's not gonna be focused
on you.

07:13.334 --> 07:17.098
Anyway, I'm sure when I tell him
that we're getting married...

07:17.198 --> 07:18.898
...He'll start to learn
to accept you.

07:18.998 --> 07:20.150
Are you sure about that?

07:20.250 --> 07:21.227
Of course.

07:21.327 --> 07:25.322
I can't really see Victor
as the accepting type.

07:27.726 --> 07:31.161
We're on our way to
a funeral you wanker!

07:31.261 --> 07:33.591
Haven't you got any respect?

07:33.691 --> 07:35.689
Okay, calm down.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.520
It's all right, breathe.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.627
Through your nose.
Okay?

07:39.727 --> 07:40.785
Deep breaths.

07:40.885 --> 07:42.274
You alright?

07:42.374 --> 07:44.374
That fucking...

07:53.145 --> 07:54.719
Alright, I'm gonna go down.

07:54.819 --> 07:56.510
Hope they brought the right
coffin this time.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.509
I'll come with you.

07:57.609 --> 07:58.509
It's okay, I can do it.

07:58.609 --> 07:59.305
I know, I know you can.

07:59.405 --> 08:01.032
I'm just gonna check on
the seats.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.107
To make sure there's enough room
for Uncle Alfie.

08:03.207 --> 08:05.207
Shit.

08:07.304 --> 08:09.036
Hello?

08:09.136 --> 08:11.634
Hey mate. How are you?
You alright?

08:11.734 --> 08:13.101
Yeah.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.921
Of course I remember
Uncle Alfie.

08:16.199 --> 08:19.430
Absolutely fine.
Yeah, not a problem at all.

08:19.530 --> 08:22.393
No. Of course I don't mind.

08:22.795 --> 08:25.077
Alright. Yeah, don't worry.

08:25.177 --> 08:26.493
It's fine.
I promise.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.593
See you soon.
Okay, bye.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.792
Shit.

08:45.283 --> 08:47.493
Is this...your father sir?

08:51.412 --> 08:53.412
Yes, it is yes.

09:05.604 --> 09:07.604
Hey mum.
You alright?

09:07.704 --> 09:10.388
I just don't know what I'm
going to do without him.

09:10.488 --> 09:12.034
What do I have to live for now?

09:12.134 --> 09:14.599
Don't be silly.
You got your friends, family...

09:14.699 --> 09:16.598
You got me and Jane
and Robert...

09:16.698 --> 09:17.898
Where is Robert?
Have you heard from him?

09:17.998 --> 09:19.169
His plane will land at 10:00

09:19.269 --> 09:20.496
But he'll be here.
Don't worry.

09:20.596 --> 09:23.194
If there's anything I can do Sandra...

09:23.294 --> 09:24.549
Don't put your hand there dear...

09:24.649 --> 09:26.649
...you'll leave marks.

09:43.266 --> 09:45.198
I'll get'em to you
this evening.

09:45.298 --> 09:48.116
No, can't do it this afternoon.
I got a funeral.

09:48.216 --> 09:49.425
Yeah, my uncle died.

09:49.525 --> 09:51.059
Yeah, tragic.

09:51.159 --> 09:53.484
I'm telling you mate.
This is really powerful stuff.

09:53.584 --> 09:55.976
You really only need to take half.

09:56.076 --> 09:59.673
Trust me. You're gonna
bite your fucking head off.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.519
I gotta go.
My sister's in.

10:01.619 --> 10:04.005
I'll tell you if I get to the bar
after the funeral.

10:04.105 --> 10:06.105
Bye.

10:18.164 --> 10:20.164
Hang on!

10:25.693 --> 10:27.159
Hi. How's it going?

10:27.259 --> 10:29.091
Troy you're not ready?
Come on, we're gonna be late.

10:29.191 --> 10:30.941
I put on my trousers and
I'm done.

10:31.041 --> 10:31.983
Are you guys okay?

10:32.083 --> 10:33.023
Simon is a bit freaked out.

10:33.123 --> 10:35.439
Some asshole almost drove us
off the road.

10:35.539 --> 10:39.352
Fucking bastards. Make yourselves comfy.
I'll be out in two minutes.

10:39.452 --> 10:41.251
Look at these pills all
over the place.

10:41.351 --> 10:43.649
Troy is studying to be
a pharmacist.

10:43.749 --> 10:45.181
Are you okay?

10:45.281 --> 10:46.766
I'm a bit shaky...

10:46.866 --> 10:49.160
Not much, just a little...

10:52.778 --> 10:54.577
Take one of these.

10:54.677 --> 10:56.275
It will calm you down.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.608
You sure?

10:57.708 --> 10:59.707
Absolutely.
It's just Valium.

10:59.807 --> 11:01.506
I used to take them all the time.

11:01.606 --> 11:03.971
It will make you feel better.
Honestly.

11:04.071 --> 11:06.071
Come on. Open wide.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.666
I'm ready.

11:26.958 --> 11:28.958
Hello?

11:31.256 --> 11:32.555
Hello?

11:32.655 --> 11:34.288
Robert?

11:34.388 --> 11:36.287
Robert.

11:36.387 --> 11:37.139
Hi, Mom.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.136
Darling.

11:38.236 --> 11:40.236
Happy to see you.

11:44.407 --> 11:46.691
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.780
Hi Robert.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.478
How are you?

11:50.578 --> 11:51.378
Good.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.175
How was your flight?

11:52.275 --> 11:54.976
Great... There was a lot of turbulence
that was a bit worrying...

11:55.076 --> 11:57.251
That's the thing about 1st class.
It doesn't matter how much you pay...

11:57.351 --> 11:57.865
for the ticket...

11:57.965 --> 12:02.300
...if the plane crushes we're
all gonna end up dead.

12:02.405 --> 12:04.405
Sorry.

12:04.896 --> 12:05.903
No, no, I'll go.

12:06.003 --> 12:08.003
Don't worry.

12:10.867 --> 12:12.867
Shit.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.122
That's him.

12:26.222 --> 12:31.917
Jesus, Howard. You didn't say he was
gonna be in a fucking wheelchair.

12:42.350 --> 12:44.164
Uncle Alfie, hello.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.714
We're here to take you
to the funeral.

12:45.814 --> 12:49.299
Where the fuck have you been?
You're late.

13:13.066 --> 13:15.164
This is bloody grim, isn't it?

13:15.264 --> 13:16.463
It's not supposed to be fun.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.563
I know, but Jesus...

13:19.396 --> 13:23.800
I feel like my heart has been wrenched
out of my ribcage.

13:23.900 --> 13:24.579
It's awful.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.200
Well, that's grief for you.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.183
That's why I don't like
close relationships.

13:28.283 --> 13:30.448
Too much emotion.

13:33.388 --> 13:36.452
I'm just glad you're
gonna be here with Mom.

13:36.552 --> 13:38.556
Yeah, well not for long.

13:38.656 --> 13:40.829
Jane and I are moving out.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.349
What about Mom?

13:42.449 --> 13:45.314
Actually I was thinking
maybe she'd like to...

13:45.414 --> 13:48.279
...to come with you to New York
for a bit.

13:48.379 --> 13:50.069
Don't be ridiculous.
I can't take her to New York.

13:50.169 --> 13:52.234
What am I gonna do with her?
Take her to parties?

13:52.334 --> 13:53.264
We've already decided.

13:53.364 --> 13:54.808
We're putting a deposit
in a flat.

13:54.908 --> 13:56.829
- I'm gonna need money.
- What money?

13:56.929 --> 13:59.240
Money for all this.
For the funeral.

13:59.340 --> 14:00.772
You agreed to pay the half.

14:00.872 --> 14:02.872
- Did I?
- Yeah.

14:04.004 --> 14:06.004
Yeah, so...

14:06.569 --> 14:08.668
Yeah, I don't have it on me Daniel.

14:08.768 --> 14:10.966
I can get it to you in a few... months.

14:11.066 --> 14:13.275
A few months?
Robert, I need it now.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.929
Can't happen.
I'm skinned.

14:15.029 --> 14:16.999
What do you mean skinned?

14:17.099 --> 14:19.389
You're a successful novelist
you live in New York...

14:19.489 --> 14:21.016
...and you have a penthouse there.
What do you mean?

14:21.116 --> 14:23.463
Do you have any idea how
much it costs for up-keeping it?

14:23.563 --> 14:26.480
And besides this, I paid a fortune
to fly out here.

14:26.580 --> 14:29.289
Do you know how much they charge for
1st class nowadays?

14:29.389 --> 14:32.180
It's a fucking disgrace.

14:34.053 --> 14:36.518
So, poor old Uncle Eddie, eh?

14:36.909 --> 14:37.931
Yes.

14:38.031 --> 14:40.857
Did you ever meet Uncle Eddie, Simon?

14:40.957 --> 14:42.848
Simon?

14:42.948 --> 14:45.081
Was there a dog in here
just now?

14:45.181 --> 14:47.181
What?

14:47.679 --> 14:50.278
I'm sure there was a dog in here.

14:50.378 --> 14:53.438
What the hell are you talking about?

15:10.599 --> 15:12.860
There's nowhere to park.

15:13.755 --> 15:14.873
This is ridiculous.

15:14.973 --> 15:15.959
How about over there?

15:16.059 --> 15:18.059
The guy is coming out.

15:18.372 --> 15:18.962
Take it!

15:19.062 --> 15:20.461
Alright!

15:20.561 --> 15:22.561
What are you doing?

15:23.291 --> 15:25.291
Are you mental?

15:28.658 --> 15:30.038
Sorry.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.620
Excuse me.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.932
Sorry...
Oh, hi Martha.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.094
I was just about to park there
actually.

15:35.194 --> 15:37.126
Are you a relative, Howard?

15:37.226 --> 15:38.483
No, I'm not.
But...

15:38.583 --> 15:40.583
Hey Martha.

15:41.050 --> 15:43.050
Who's that?

15:50.900 --> 15:51.710
What's happening?

15:51.810 --> 15:52.976
Did you see that?
She barely even looked at me.

15:53.076 --> 15:54.708
I said what's happening?
Are we there?

15:54.808 --> 15:56.864
Oh, my God. We got
Uncle Alfie in the car.

15:56.964 --> 16:01.071
I can't believe I forgot to say
I've got Uncle Alfie in the car.

16:01.171 --> 16:03.418
Alright, keep your hair on!

16:03.518 --> 16:05.569
What the hell is going on?

16:05.669 --> 16:07.669
She barely even looked.

16:16.496 --> 16:18.961
Very green here. Isn't it...?

16:19.861 --> 16:21.359
Very green...

16:21.459 --> 16:24.158
Simon, what the hell is
the matter with you?

16:24.258 --> 16:25.957
What do you mean?

16:26.057 --> 16:28.856
You're talking about phantom dogs
and things being green...

16:28.956 --> 16:30.655
What's going on?

16:30.755 --> 16:32.755
I don't know...

16:41.948 --> 16:43.772
Martha.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.280
Is Simon normally like this?

16:45.380 --> 16:47.572
Of course he's not normally
like this.

16:47.672 --> 16:49.672
Something's not right.

16:51.329 --> 16:53.329
Hello...

17:00.001 --> 17:01.907
I think it must be the Valium.

17:02.007 --> 17:02.804
The Valium?

17:02.904 --> 17:04.170
Yes.

17:04.270 --> 17:06.367
I gave him a Valium
from your flat.

17:06.468 --> 17:09.358
I think he's just not
used to it...

17:09.933 --> 17:11.933
Right.

17:14.762 --> 17:16.962
Are you gonna get any closer?

17:17.061 --> 17:19.161
You're going the wrong way.

17:19.261 --> 17:21.087
Stop the car. I need to
speak to Martha.

17:21.186 --> 17:22.077
What?

17:22.176 --> 17:24.387
I need to speak to Martha.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.944
What about Alfie?
I need help with Uncle Alfie.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.489
We're gonna be late!

17:28.589 --> 17:30.629
Please, stop doing that.

17:37.650 --> 17:41.050
Thank you for coming.
So good to see you.

17:41.681 --> 17:44.447
It's so weird to be back here.
I feel so out of it.

17:44.547 --> 17:47.112
That's because you live in a different
country. You loose touch.

17:47.212 --> 17:51.887
Who are all these people?
I don't recognise any of them.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.986
Who's that guy?

17:54.407 --> 17:57.206
I've no idea. Probably some friend
from dad's work.

17:57.306 --> 18:00.371
Are you telling me I have to pay for
this entire funeral on my own?

18:00.471 --> 18:02.400
Well, I can't draw money out of
thin air, Daniel.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.500
Jesus fucking Christ!

18:05.082 --> 18:06.925
Daniel.
How's everything going?

18:07.025 --> 18:08.563
Fine, thanks Reverend Davis.

18:08.663 --> 18:10.372
We're just waiting for everyone to
arrive and then we can start.

18:10.472 --> 18:12.472
Great, thank you.

18:12.864 --> 18:14.463
Have you met my brother Robert?

18:14.563 --> 18:17.504
The writer of course.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

18:17.604 --> 18:19.286
I have read several of
your novels.

18:19.386 --> 18:20.260
Really?

18:20.360 --> 18:22.458
You must be very
proud of your brother.

18:22.558 --> 18:23.657
Yeah, very proud.

18:23.757 --> 18:25.656
Will you be reading the
eulogy today?

18:25.756 --> 18:28.136
No, Daniel is
going to do it.

18:29.535 --> 18:30.954
Great.

18:31.054 --> 18:34.794
I'll just make sure I have
everything I need.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.992
Listen, I think you
should do the eulogy.

18:40.092 --> 18:42.320
...everyone's expecting you to do it,
I'll just make a mess of it anyways.

18:42.420 --> 18:44.545
Don't be silly.
You do it.

18:44.746 --> 18:46.746
You'll be fine.

18:47.678 --> 18:49.032
All these can go
through now.

18:49.132 --> 18:50.796
How's my little sister?

18:50.896 --> 18:52.275
That's very sad.

18:52.375 --> 18:54.308
He was a wonderful husband
wasn't he?

18:54.408 --> 18:56.408
So tender, so devoted.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.472
Can I get you a cop of
tea, Sandra?

18:58.572 --> 19:00.305
Tea can do many things, Jane.

19:00.405 --> 19:03.125
But it can't bring back
the dead.

19:07.900 --> 19:10.960
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

19:11.069 --> 19:13.066
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

19:13.166 --> 19:15.278
Daniel, have you called yet
about the deposit?

19:15.378 --> 19:16.250
No, I haven't.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.108
Why don't you give me the number
and I can do it?

19:18.208 --> 19:19.339
Jane, don't make a fuss.

19:19.439 --> 19:21.259
Do you see that guy standing by
the table?

19:21.359 --> 19:23.158
Do you recognise him at all?

19:23.258 --> 19:24.488
He's really staring at me.

19:24.588 --> 19:26.178
Are you listening to me at all?

19:26.278 --> 19:28.555
We have to put the deposit on the
flat, before it's too late.

19:28.655 --> 19:29.292
I know.

19:29.392 --> 19:31.392
Alright?

19:45.670 --> 19:47.670
You'll break it!

19:48.045 --> 19:49.048
Hurry up, we're late.

19:49.148 --> 19:52.046
Oh God...

19:53.541 --> 19:56.601
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

19:56.751 --> 19:57.865
..."My father was an
exceptional man"...

19:57.965 --> 19:59.482
Kate has grown up a bit
isn't she?

19:59.582 --> 20:00.137
What?

20:00.237 --> 20:01.136
Katey.

20:01.236 --> 20:04.385
She was a little girl
when I left and now...

20:04.485 --> 20:05.600
...she's fit.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.433
I'm going to chat with her.

20:07.533 --> 20:09.533
Yeah, why don't you?

20:11.430 --> 20:13.730
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

20:13.830 --> 20:15.429
Hello there.

20:15.529 --> 20:17.529
Oh, hello.

20:18.127 --> 20:21.867
I was really sorry to hear
about your father.

20:22.258 --> 20:24.257
He always talked about you.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.022
Said you were a good son.

20:26.122 --> 20:28.122
Thank you.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.520
Did he ever mention me?

20:30.620 --> 20:31.919
I'm Peter.

20:32.019 --> 20:36.439
Peter... I don't think so.
Were you friends with Dad?

20:36.980 --> 20:40.465
Nice to meet you and
thank you for coming.

20:50.767 --> 20:52.432
Push the bloody thing...

20:52.532 --> 20:53.296
I am damn it...

20:53.396 --> 20:55.396
You're useless...

20:55.873 --> 20:58.138
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

20:58.238 --> 20:58.971
Daniel.

20:59.071 --> 21:01.007
I think we should be calling
everyone in, now...

21:01.107 --> 21:01.967
...to start the service.

21:02.067 --> 21:02.665
Sure.

21:02.765 --> 21:05.417
Really I'm only supposed to be
here until 3.

21:05.517 --> 21:07.629
Sure. Do you mind if we wait
5 minutes for my Uncle Alfie?

21:07.729 --> 21:09.147
We shouldn't start without
him, if possible.

21:09.247 --> 21:11.247
Sure.

21:24.957 --> 21:26.622
Look.

21:26.722 --> 21:28.722
Isn't it beautiful?

21:29.653 --> 21:30.996
Martha. Can I have a word?

21:31.096 --> 21:32.219
Excuse me.

21:32.319 --> 21:33.934
Why?
What is it?

21:34.034 --> 21:35.431
I have to tell you something.

21:35.531 --> 21:39.215
I'm warning you in advance
you're not gonna like it.

21:39.315 --> 21:40.873
Nice to see you.
Thank you for coming.

21:40.973 --> 21:41.468
Daniel.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.469
Uncle Victor.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.112
Hello, Robert.

21:44.212 --> 21:45.778
Uncle Victor.
How are you?

21:45.878 --> 21:47.770
I'm...

21:47.870 --> 21:48.991
...sad.

21:49.091 --> 21:49.743
I understand.

21:49.843 --> 21:51.319
So, how are things in
New York?

21:51.419 --> 21:52.874
Great. Really good.

21:52.974 --> 21:56.338
What's with this nonsense about you
not doing the eulogy?

21:56.438 --> 21:58.221
That's right. Daniel is gonna
do the eulogy.

21:58.321 --> 21:59.937
Well that's a dams shame.

22:00.037 --> 22:02.335
I mean, I'm sure Daniel will
be fine but...

22:02.435 --> 22:06.049
...after all you're the
writer in the family.

22:06.149 --> 22:08.954
Will you just excuse me a second?

22:09.237 --> 22:10.193
So...

22:10.293 --> 22:11.838
...any new books coming out?

22:11.938 --> 22:12.790
I'll get my things together.

22:12.890 --> 22:13.962
Sure.

22:14.062 --> 22:15.628
You alright?

22:15.728 --> 22:18.860
Every single bloody person
wants Robert to do the eulogy.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.510
He's my father too,
isn't he?

22:20.610 --> 22:22.259
I'm entitled to the
bloody eulogy.

22:22.359 --> 22:24.359
Of course.

22:25.015 --> 22:27.995
And it's gonna be the best bloody
eulogy anybody has ever heard.

22:28.095 --> 22:28.775
Alright?

22:28.875 --> 22:32.569
Looks like Robert won't
be doing the eulogy.

22:35.513 --> 22:36.537
What did you just say?

22:36.637 --> 22:40.847
I said the Valium you gave Simon
wasn't actually a Valium.

22:40.947 --> 22:43.893
It's a hallucinogenic concoction.

22:44.212 --> 22:47.676
You know, stuff lice acid, mescaline,
a little smaller though.

22:47.776 --> 22:48.743
This isn't funny Troy.

22:48.843 --> 22:51.563
I'm not being funny.
Look at him.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.651
You're absolutely stupid.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.737
How can you leave stuff like
that, on your flat?

22:58.837 --> 23:00.240
I didn't think that
someone will take it.

23:00.340 --> 23:02.532
Who goes to someone else's flat
and take anything?

23:02.632 --> 23:04.632
It was a Valium bottle.

23:05.499 --> 23:07.032
Fuck, Troy.

23:07.132 --> 23:08.831
What am I to do?

23:08.931 --> 23:09.790
Should I tell him?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.080
No! Don't do that.

23:11.180 --> 23:13.063
You'll freak him out completely.

23:13.163 --> 23:15.103
We should keep a
very close eye on him.

23:15.203 --> 23:16.675
Make sure he doesn't get
out of control.

23:16.775 --> 23:21.092
And don't let him spend too long
talking to one person.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.192
Damn.

23:37.449 --> 23:39.256
Hey Dad.
How are you doing?

23:39.356 --> 23:40.054
You're late.

23:40.154 --> 23:40.702
Hi Dad.

23:40.802 --> 23:41.732
Hi Troy.

23:41.832 --> 23:43.245
You're missing University
today?

23:43.345 --> 23:44.744
Nothing to worry.
I'll catch up.

23:44.844 --> 23:47.143
I know.
I'm not worried about you.

23:47.243 --> 23:49.142
I see you brought
your friend along.

23:49.242 --> 23:51.235
His name is Simon.
Simon?

23:51.335 --> 23:53.773
Of course I brought him,
he's my boyfriend.

23:53.873 --> 23:56.168
Martha, so good to see you.

23:56.538 --> 23:59.536
I'm so sorry Aunt Sandra.
We'll miss Uncle Edward terribly.

23:59.636 --> 24:01.235
Yeah, he was a great guy.

24:01.335 --> 24:03.062
Yes he was.

24:03.162 --> 24:04.130
Simon, this is my...

24:04.230 --> 24:05.966
Yeah absolutely...

24:06.066 --> 24:08.653
So sorry about the death.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.473
So sorry...

24:14.573 --> 24:15.864
Thank you.

24:15.964 --> 24:17.964
...everything.

24:31.618 --> 24:32.751
What are you gonna do?

24:32.851 --> 24:34.091
No idea.

24:34.191 --> 24:36.916
I can't leave. Aunt Sandra will
never speak to me again.

24:37.016 --> 24:39.016
Shit.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.513
Hey Martha.

24:59.429 --> 25:00.532
You look nice.

25:00.632 --> 25:01.733
I'm dressed for a funeral.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.800
Yeah, but still...

25:03.900 --> 25:07.565
I heard about the engagement.
What's that about?

25:07.665 --> 25:10.030
Who told you that?
I haven't even told my dad.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.228
Is that the guy you're
gonna marry?

25:12.328 --> 25:15.560
You're gonna spend the rest of
your life with him?

25:15.660 --> 25:17.660
Yup, that's him.

25:22.668 --> 25:23.719
Simon?

25:23.819 --> 25:25.819
Martha...

25:26.758 --> 25:28.949
Come on!

25:31.818 --> 25:34.368
Can you give me a hand, Justin?

25:37.697 --> 25:39.697
Hi...Daniel.

25:40.088 --> 25:42.917
There's something I'd like to talk to
you about when you have a moment.

25:43.017 --> 25:44.650
Great, do you mind
if we do it later?

25:44.750 --> 25:46.451
Because my Uncle Alfie
just came in.

25:46.551 --> 25:48.551
Sure.

25:54.472 --> 25:56.017
Thank you Justin.
Thank so much mate.

25:56.117 --> 25:57.571
I hope it wasn't too
much hustle.

25:57.671 --> 25:58.836
How are you Uncle Alfie?

25:58.936 --> 26:00.936
Terrible.

26:13.563 --> 26:14.927
Ladies and Gentlemen.

26:15.027 --> 26:17.850
If you could all
kindly take your seats...

26:17.950 --> 26:20.755
We're about to begin the service.

26:24.921 --> 26:26.921
Simon, please.

26:27.514 --> 26:28.226
Move.

26:28.326 --> 26:29.352
Don't start yet.

26:29.452 --> 26:31.452
Don't start. Move.

27:16.126 --> 27:18.450
Jesus, Howard.
You stink.

27:20.481 --> 27:22.481
Family and friends.

27:22.923 --> 27:26.455
Maybe, because you left me to
deal with Uncle Alfie on my own...

27:26.555 --> 27:28.839
...not to mention you
taking all the credit.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.518
Can you please be quiet?

27:30.618 --> 27:33.485
We'll start with a favorite
passage of Edward's...

27:33.585 --> 27:35.487
...from the King James' bible...

27:35.587 --> 27:39.255
...it's the 1st book of Samuel
chapter 18.

27:40.812 --> 27:42.858
Martha, just so you know,

27:42.958 --> 27:45.879
we had Uncle Alfie in the
car with us.

27:45.979 --> 27:47.779
And you took my parking space.

27:47.879 --> 27:50.448
And I had to push him half a mile
up the hill by myself.

27:50.548 --> 27:52.039
Almost fainted.

27:52.139 --> 27:53.738
That was MY parking space.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.282
If you don't stop this...

27:55.382 --> 27:57.502
...I'll take you out and kick
the living shit out of you.

27:57.602 --> 27:58.352
Do you understand?

27:58.452 --> 27:59.492
What's going on?

27:59.592 --> 28:00.553
She stole my
parking space.

28:00.653 --> 28:01.740
What do you mean she stole
your parking space?

28:01.840 --> 28:04.645
This is a funeral.
Behave yourself.

28:06.462 --> 28:10.403
Then, Jonathan and David made
a covenant.

28:11.173 --> 28:14.233
Because he loved him
as his own soul.

28:14.740 --> 28:18.272
And so it came to pass
that the soul of Jonathan...

28:18.372 --> 28:21.025
...was knit with
the soul of David.

28:21.125 --> 28:25.352
And Jonathan stripped himself
of the robe that was upon him...

28:25.452 --> 28:27.492
...and gave it to David.

28:27.685 --> 28:30.936
And his garments,
even his sword...

28:31.338 --> 28:33.338
...and his bow...

28:33.811 --> 28:35.887
...and his belt.

28:39.613 --> 28:44.118
Now, we'll have a few words from
Edward's son, Daniel.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.535
Hi, everyone.

28:59.635 --> 29:02.355
Thanks for so many of
you coming.

29:03.233 --> 29:06.208
I never realised Dad was
so popular.

29:06.452 --> 29:08.340
In fact, it seems he has more
friends now...

29:08.440 --> 29:11.925
...that he's dead, than
when he was alive.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.339
My father was an exceptional man.

29:27.439 --> 29:30.817
He was born in 1938
just a year before the war.

29:30.917 --> 29:33.586
I'll never forget the time when
Dad took us...

29:33.686 --> 29:35.160
...to the place where
he grew up.

29:35.260 --> 29:38.320
Near a town called Crowley
at Sassex.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.754
It's changed a lot
over the years...

29:40.854 --> 29:43.051
...with the expansion
of Gatwick airport.

29:43.151 --> 29:45.840
Actually, it's something of
a commuter town now...

29:45.940 --> 29:49.765
...partly because of it's
proximity to London.

29:50.306 --> 29:53.673
When my father was young it
had pastures.

29:54.201 --> 29:57.339
And fields and greenery.

29:57.564 --> 30:00.180
An Dad would run around
the countryside for hours...

30:00.280 --> 30:03.080
...with his close boyhood friend, Bob.

30:03.180 --> 30:07.345
He told how they spend summer days
riding bikes...

30:07.529 --> 30:09.529
Did you see that?

30:10.295 --> 30:12.261
The coffin just moved.

30:12.361 --> 30:13.386
...and swimming in the lake.

30:13.486 --> 30:15.486
Dad's...

30:20.389 --> 30:23.222
Dad's first work, was working
after school...

30:23.322 --> 30:25.322
...as an apprentice...

30:25.667 --> 30:27.111
...for an electrician
named Mr. Thompson.

30:27.211 --> 30:29.211
It happened again!

30:30.417 --> 30:32.283
I'm telling you, the
coffin is moving!

30:32.383 --> 30:34.643
Simon, please calm down.

30:36.047 --> 30:39.270
The coffin is moving, I tell you!

30:40.587 --> 30:41.911
There's someone alive in there!

30:42.011 --> 30:44.008
Simon, where are you going?

30:44.108 --> 30:46.555
What the hell is wrong with you all?

30:46.655 --> 30:48.655
Look at it!

30:48.766 --> 30:50.552
Can't you see?

30:50.652 --> 30:52.472
Open your eyes!

30:52.572 --> 30:55.459
It's moving around in there.

30:55.559 --> 30:56.561
Can't you see?

30:56.661 --> 30:58.181
Simon, please.

30:58.281 --> 30:59.161
What are you doing there?

30:59.261 --> 31:00.465
Stop it!

31:00.565 --> 31:01.725
Don't touch that!

31:01.825 --> 31:03.865
I've got to let him out!

31:06.167 --> 31:08.167
God!

31:26.669 --> 31:28.669
Calm down Mom.

31:33.252 --> 31:35.292
Unbelievable, wasn't it?

31:36.800 --> 31:40.255
If you like you can have some
tea and cake...

31:40.355 --> 31:43.670
...and we'll call you as
soon as we can.

31:46.180 --> 31:47.017
What the fuck was all
that about?

31:47.117 --> 31:48.969
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

31:49.069 --> 31:50.205
The coffin was moving...

31:50.305 --> 31:52.420
Just go back inside
and I'll explain it.

31:52.520 --> 31:53.842
I'm so sorry.

31:53.942 --> 31:56.218
I'm sure I heard scratching noise...

31:56.318 --> 31:58.318
Please...

31:58.901 --> 31:59.700
Are you alright?

31:59.800 --> 32:00.700
No.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.965
And I haven't made the call
about the deposit yet.

32:05.869 --> 32:07.496
Kill him.

32:07.596 --> 32:09.596
I'm going to kill him.

32:10.027 --> 32:10.894
Dad, leave it.

32:10.994 --> 32:11.693
Leave it?!

32:11.793 --> 32:12.926
He wrecked the funeral.

32:13.026 --> 32:13.892
It wasn't his fault.

32:13.992 --> 32:15.373
What do you mean it
wasn't his fault?

32:15.473 --> 32:17.623
Your Aunt Sandra is in tatters.

32:17.723 --> 32:20.643
I want him out of hear, this moment.
Is that clear?

32:20.743 --> 32:23.468
Tell me you will have nothing
to do with that...

32:23.568 --> 32:25.077
...ridiculous man, ever again.

32:25.177 --> 32:25.923
I'm sorry.

32:26.023 --> 32:28.023
No, I can't do that.

32:28.850 --> 32:30.838
Why not?

32:30.938 --> 32:33.614
Because we're moving in together.

32:33.714 --> 32:35.281
God.

32:35.381 --> 32:38.150
Have you completely
lost your senses?

32:38.250 --> 32:41.953
He's not actually like this.
He took some drugs and...

32:42.053 --> 32:42.944
...and made him act like this.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.044
Drugs? What drugs?

32:50.405 --> 32:54.123
He took some Valium and had
a bad reaction.

32:56.835 --> 32:58.128
Valium?

32:58.228 --> 33:00.228
Yes.

33:02.754 --> 33:04.754
That's it.

33:05.230 --> 33:07.610
We'll talk about this later.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.666
Simon?

33:15.766 --> 33:16.671
Martha...

33:16.771 --> 33:18.445
Okay...
Come and sit down.

33:18.545 --> 33:20.988
Alright Janet.
I appreciate that.

33:21.088 --> 33:23.088
Are you alright mate?

33:24.020 --> 33:25.314
That was awful, wasn't it?

33:25.414 --> 33:27.475
He fell in front of your mom like
a dead trout...

33:27.575 --> 33:29.011
Howard, please...

33:29.111 --> 33:31.769
Yeah sorry. It's just...

33:31.953 --> 33:34.081
...you never know when it's
gonna happen to you.

33:34.181 --> 33:36.217
Like me.
I've got this...

33:36.317 --> 33:38.410
...weird patch of skin

33:38.594 --> 33:39.807
I've had that a
couple of weeks...

33:39.907 --> 33:41.200
...with no idea what it is...

33:41.300 --> 33:43.442
Why not show it to my Uncle Victor?
He's a doctor.

33:43.542 --> 33:45.542
Good idea.

33:49.205 --> 33:50.986
I swear I saw it moving.

33:51.086 --> 33:54.741
I swear I saw it moving.
No one else saw it?

33:54.896 --> 33:57.972
I swear I saw it moving.
I must be going mad.

33:58.072 --> 33:59.899
My hands are so big!

33:59.999 --> 34:04.164
Simon. listen to me.
I need to tell you something.

34:05.273 --> 34:08.558
You know I gave you some
Valium earlier?

34:08.658 --> 34:09.893
Yes.

34:09.994 --> 34:11.994
Well...

34:12.467 --> 34:14.839
...it turns out...

34:15.177 --> 34:18.378
...it wasn't actually Valium
at all.

34:21.786 --> 34:23.320
Can you hear me?

34:23.420 --> 34:24.831
Hello?

34:24.931 --> 34:26.013
You think we can start now?

34:26.112 --> 34:26.724
I believe yes.

34:26.824 --> 34:28.824
How do you feel, Sandra?

34:31.251 --> 34:32.181
Hello doctor.

34:32.281 --> 34:35.007
I've had this skin discoloration for
a couple of weeks now...

34:35.107 --> 34:37.839
It's not going anywhere.
I know it's just a small patch...

34:37.938 --> 34:39.909
...but it's weird.
It does look weird, doesn't it?

34:40.010 --> 34:42.197
Victor, I'm going
back now.

34:42.297 --> 34:43.908
You should probably go see
a dermatologist.

34:44.007 --> 34:45.706
What do you think it is?

34:45.806 --> 34:48.089
It looks like some kind
of pigment mutation.

34:48.188 --> 34:49.205
Pigment mutation?

34:49.304 --> 34:51.300
Probably some allergic
reaction to...

34:51.400 --> 34:53.031
...shellfish, nuts.

34:53.130 --> 34:54.556
What kind of nuts?

34:54.657 --> 34:58.142
Don't know. Peanuts, almonds...
Excuse me.

35:02.498 --> 35:04.498
Do you see now?

35:05.297 --> 35:07.297
Yes?

35:09.736 --> 35:11.736
It's hallucinogenic

35:17.056 --> 35:18.774
My advice is to relax...

35:18.874 --> 35:20.760
...and just go with the flow.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.453
Try and enjoy it.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.553
You!

35:25.285 --> 35:26.285
Simon!

35:26.385 --> 35:27.883
How long does it last?

35:27.983 --> 35:28.683
I don't know.

35:28.783 --> 35:29.582
Simon!

35:29.682 --> 35:31.282
Around 8 hours?

35:31.382 --> 35:32.914
8 hours of this?

35:33.014 --> 35:34.014
Simon let go.

35:34.114 --> 35:36.114
You!

35:36.392 --> 35:37.375
Simon?

35:37.475 --> 35:40.110
Let me go.
I'm going to be sick.

35:42.544 --> 35:44.298
Simon, get back.

35:44.398 --> 35:46.398
Simon.

35:47.626 --> 35:49.751
A word with you Martha...

35:50.788 --> 35:52.788
I'm sorry, excuse me...

35:54.026 --> 35:56.321
Oh God, he's gonna be sick!

36:03.948 --> 36:05.948
Is it okay in there?

36:09.196 --> 36:11.196
Simon are you okay?

36:11.925 --> 36:13.908
Simon.

36:14.008 --> 36:15.991
Simon, let me in.

36:17.989 --> 36:19.221
Simon.

36:19.321 --> 36:20.768
Martha?

36:20.868 --> 36:22.992
Did you happen to see
a pill bottle?

36:23.092 --> 36:23.811
Shit

36:23.911 --> 36:24.891
Simon?

36:24.991 --> 36:26.150
Right!

36:26.250 --> 36:27.651
Keep it together!

36:27.751 --> 36:28.822
Keep it together...

36:28.922 --> 36:30.902
You can do this.

36:31.002 --> 36:32.981
You're Simon Smith.

36:33.788 --> 36:35.788
You're a solicitor.

36:38.348 --> 36:39.900
8 hours...

36:40.000 --> 36:41.458
No problem.

36:41.558 --> 36:43.558
8 hours is at...

36:43.871 --> 36:45.871
Where's my watch?

36:47.305 --> 36:49.305
It's already been...

36:50.366 --> 36:52.366
Simon, open the door.

36:52.703 --> 36:56.426
7 hours to go.
God, Jesus!

36:56.526 --> 36:58.137
Fuck!

36:58.237 --> 36:59.387
<i>Fuck.</i>

36:59.487 --> 37:01.395
It's nothing to worry about.

37:01.495 --> 37:03.446
<i>Jesus!
Fuck!</i>

37:03.546 --> 37:05.728
Grief does strange things to
people doesn't it?

37:05.828 --> 37:07.672
Yeah.

37:07.772 --> 37:09.660
If you remember, I have something
to talk to you about.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.371
Oh yes, yes.

37:11.471 --> 37:13.002
Is there some place quiet
we can go?

37:13.102 --> 37:15.102
Sure.

37:40.210 --> 37:41.432
Are you writing a book?

37:41.532 --> 37:42.438
Yes.

37:42.538 --> 37:42.807
Like your brother.

37:42.907 --> 37:44.207
Well yes, but I write different.

37:44.307 --> 37:45.439
He's a great writer
isn't he?

37:45.539 --> 37:46.836
Yes, he is.

37:46.936 --> 37:48.213
Anyway...

37:48.313 --> 37:50.290
Yes, actually...

37:50.390 --> 37:52.518
...I have some photos
I wanted to show you.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.032
Okay.

37:54.132 --> 37:56.132
- May I?
- Sure

37:58.200 --> 38:00.600
We became quite close
your father and I...

38:00.700 --> 38:01.931
...the last few months.

38:02.031 --> 38:04.169
Ended up spending quite a
lot of time together.

38:04.269 --> 38:05.319
Right.

38:05.419 --> 38:08.272
Here's me and your father
at Ridgens Park.

38:08.372 --> 38:09.293
Ah, yes

38:09.393 --> 38:12.691
And here we are on top of
those London buses

38:12.791 --> 38:14.791
Terrible picture of me.

38:15.037 --> 38:17.314
Where did you and my dad meet?

38:17.414 --> 38:19.414
Just around.

38:23.685 --> 38:25.685
Simon.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.583
Are you alright?

38:29.809 --> 38:31.809
Yes, yes...

38:32.994 --> 38:34.536
Keep on coming, you...

38:34.636 --> 38:36.636
...and join the others.

38:36.828 --> 38:38.828
Join the others and...

38:43.171 --> 38:46.401
Here we are at a fancy
costume party...

38:46.653 --> 38:47.538
...in Kensington.

38:47.638 --> 38:51.548
That's your dad dressed up
as a Roman Centurion.

38:58.989 --> 39:01.131
In what capacity were you
actually friends with my dad?

39:01.231 --> 39:02.847
I mean no offense...

39:02.947 --> 39:05.215
...but he never mentioned
you to me...

39:05.315 --> 39:07.571
...and you have all these
pictures with him...

39:07.671 --> 39:09.671
...as if you were...

39:27.378 --> 39:29.378
"Screen Goddesses"

39:37.110 --> 39:38.309
Oh God.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.409
Oh my God!

39:43.352 --> 39:46.511
I know this might come as
quite a shock to you

39:46.611 --> 39:48.189
I'm sure he would have told you
himself...

39:48.289 --> 39:50.974
...but he wasn't sure how
you'd react.

39:51.074 --> 39:51.943
My mother knows of this?

39:52.043 --> 39:53.201
No.

39:53.301 --> 39:56.628
And there's no reason
she should find out.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.618
As long as I get what's
owed to me.

39:59.976 --> 40:01.196
What?

40:01.296 --> 40:04.113
Well, I think I deserve
something.

40:04.934 --> 40:07.399
Your father and I
were lovers.

40:09.279 --> 40:12.448
He left me absolutely nothing in
his will.

40:12.548 --> 40:14.447
How do you think that makes
me feel?

40:14.547 --> 40:16.273
I'll tell you how it makes
me feel.

40:16.373 --> 40:17.806
Cheap.

40:17.906 --> 40:19.906
Like a cheap slut.

40:20.153 --> 40:22.651
Don't you think
I deserve something?

40:22.751 --> 40:24.751
What do you want?

40:25.927 --> 40:29.242
Well I think 15,000 pounds
should do it.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.695
15,000 pounds?

40:31.804 --> 40:33.070
I'm supposed to be
buying a flat.

40:33.170 --> 40:34.825
Well that's up to you.

40:34.925 --> 40:36.691
Wait a minute...

40:36.791 --> 40:38.571
You think you can come in here
and show me...

40:38.671 --> 40:39.898
...pictures of you and my dad...

40:39.998 --> 40:41.651
...on a bus, and that counts as proof?

40:41.751 --> 40:43.791
That's no fucking proof.

40:45.422 --> 40:47.403
What's that?

40:47.503 --> 40:49.192
Jesus

40:49.292 --> 40:51.292
Now, I don't want to.

40:51.991 --> 40:55.300
But I'll go out there and I'll show
these photos to every single person.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.120
Do you really want me
to do that?

41:01.019 --> 41:02.638
You wait here.

41:02.738 --> 41:04.738
Wait here.

41:06.993 --> 41:07.914
Daniel.

41:08.014 --> 41:10.419
I was telling George here
how when we were boys,...

41:10.519 --> 41:14.939
...your dad loved to makes us go
naked to take a bath.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.529
Simon, open the door.

41:34.844 --> 41:36.643
Anything I can do
to help?

41:36.743 --> 41:37.941
Not really. Thanks.

41:38.041 --> 41:40.041
Everything under control?

41:40.141 --> 41:42.141
Simon?

41:42.241 --> 41:43.849
So what are you doing next weekend?

41:43.949 --> 41:45.407
I've got a couple of tickets
and backstage passes...

41:45.507 --> 41:47.060
Look Justin. I've got
a lot on my plate right now...

41:47.160 --> 41:48.254
...and I can't deal with
your shit.

41:48.354 --> 41:50.734
Can you please just go away?

41:50.966 --> 41:52.966
Please.

41:54.866 --> 41:56.866
Simon?

42:01.194 --> 42:02.200
Can I talk to you?

42:02.300 --> 42:02.895
Not now.

42:02.995 --> 42:04.835
It's important.

42:04.935 --> 42:05.729
It's okay.

42:05.829 --> 42:07.829
Excuse us.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.059
What are you doing?

42:15.155 --> 42:17.954
Remember the little guy
from before that we didn't know...

42:18.054 --> 42:19.100
...the short guy.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.578
Yeah.

42:20.678 --> 42:22.051
I was just being with him
in the study.

42:22.151 --> 42:24.151
And?

42:25.069 --> 42:26.548
He showed me these pictures.

42:26.648 --> 42:27.470
Yeah.

42:27.570 --> 42:29.695
- Of him and Dad.
- Right.

42:29.946 --> 42:31.628
Of him and Dad together.

42:31.728 --> 42:33.728
Right.

42:34.092 --> 42:35.743
Him and Dad together at parties
in Kensington...

42:35.843 --> 42:37.087
Is this going anywhere?
'Cause...

42:37.187 --> 42:39.187
He was shacking Dad.

42:39.541 --> 42:41.541
Fuck off.

42:45.399 --> 42:46.500
You shitting me?

42:46.600 --> 42:47.500
I'm not shitting you.
I'm telling you.

42:47.600 --> 42:50.665
He showed me the pictures.
I feel sick.

42:50.765 --> 42:52.432
What are you saying?

42:52.532 --> 42:54.074
Dad was a gay?

42:54.174 --> 42:56.174
That's what I'm saying.

42:56.599 --> 42:58.004
And he was cheating on Mom?

42:58.104 --> 42:59.550
Evidently.

42:59.650 --> 43:01.310
With that little...

43:01.410 --> 43:03.231
Yes.

43:03.331 --> 43:04.626
I know it's a bombshell...

43:04.726 --> 43:06.487
...but the concern right now
is that he wants money.

43:06.587 --> 43:07.359
What do you mean?

43:07.459 --> 43:09.018
He wants money.
He wants 15,000 pounds.

43:09.118 --> 43:10.241
Tell him to go fuck himself.

43:10.341 --> 43:11.782
Don't you understand?
He's got the pictures.

43:11.882 --> 43:13.656
If we don't give him the money
he's gonna tell everybody here...

43:13.756 --> 43:15.354
...the most intimate details
of their sex life.

43:15.454 --> 43:16.735
Well I don't want to hear
those intimate details.

43:16.835 --> 43:17.586
Exactly.

43:17.686 --> 43:19.686
What 're we gonna do?

43:20.752 --> 43:22.150
Shit.

43:22.250 --> 43:24.250
Think then.

43:25.095 --> 43:27.095
Well okay, alright...

43:31.310 --> 43:32.953
What a fucking waste of time.

43:33.053 --> 43:34.209
I don't know why I even
bothered.

43:34.309 --> 43:36.114
I dressed up and everything...

43:36.214 --> 43:37.650
And she's more interested
in that idiot...

43:37.750 --> 43:39.750
...than she's in me.

43:39.973 --> 43:41.889
I tell you, this world is
severely fucked.

43:41.989 --> 43:43.199
Sounds serious.
Doesn't it?

43:43.299 --> 43:45.509
- What?
- Pigment mutation.

43:48.487 --> 43:50.274
Can you taste this?
I think it has almonds in it.

43:50.374 --> 43:51.067
Yeah?

43:51.167 --> 43:53.249
So, Daniel's uncle said I'm
allergic to almonds.

43:53.349 --> 43:54.361
Don't eat it then.

43:54.461 --> 43:55.628
Be a friend. Taste it.
Tell me what you think.

43:55.728 --> 43:56.368
No.

43:56.468 --> 43:57.564
Come on taste it.

43:57.664 --> 43:58.497
I won't.

43:58.597 --> 44:01.162
Come on, please. Can't you
just do me a favor?

44:01.262 --> 44:03.387
Will you please fuck off.

44:05.136 --> 44:06.619
Have you seen a pill bottle
lying around?

44:06.719 --> 44:08.506
It looked like a Valium bottle.

44:08.606 --> 44:09.252
No.

44:09.352 --> 44:11.352
Shit.

44:22.984 --> 44:24.984
It won't be long now.

44:32.244 --> 44:33.977
Shall we go inside?

44:34.077 --> 44:36.077
In a minute.

44:42.733 --> 44:44.733
Doctor, could you...

44:55.251 --> 44:56.764
Hello

44:56.864 --> 44:59.479
I'm sorry about...

45:00.063 --> 45:02.063
Thank you.

45:03.134 --> 45:05.721
It must me terrible losing
a husband.

45:05.821 --> 45:08.892
You're still so young.

45:10.744 --> 45:12.301
Are you gonna get married again?

45:12.401 --> 45:15.454
It's not an easy thing to
say, is it?

45:15.554 --> 45:18.287
It's just terrible isn't it?
People die...

45:18.387 --> 45:19.100
How awful is that?

45:19.200 --> 45:20.948
There was a guy that I know...

45:21.048 --> 45:23.592
...someone stabbed him to death
because he called his mother "moose".

45:23.692 --> 45:25.452
And the guy just...

45:25.552 --> 45:27.481
...stabbed him right in the neck.

45:27.581 --> 45:29.597
He cut a major artery.

45:30.036 --> 45:33.485
And you want believe how
much blood...

45:33.990 --> 45:35.985
was bursting absolutely
everywhere...

45:36.085 --> 45:38.183
And the ridiculous thing is that
the guy who did it...

45:38.283 --> 45:43.553
...told the police later, he didn't
even know what "moose" was.

45:44.162 --> 45:46.457
The cake has almonds in it?

45:47.568 --> 45:49.948
It's alright.
Doesn't matter.

45:52.157 --> 45:54.157
Excuse me.

45:56.109 --> 45:58.109
Nice talking to you.

46:08.123 --> 46:09.150
<i>Let me rephrase the question.</i>

46:09.250 --> 46:11.654
What do you mean it's best that
I pay the money?

46:11.754 --> 46:13.635
Well you've been living off
Mom and Dad. You must have...

46:13.735 --> 46:14.268
...some money left.

46:14.368 --> 46:15.640
I haven't been...

46:15.740 --> 46:17.577
I paid for this
entire funeral Robert.

46:17.677 --> 46:19.477
Wait a second.

46:19.577 --> 46:23.572
How do you know this guy isn't
bullshitting you?

46:26.778 --> 46:28.778
God!

46:29.345 --> 46:31.345
Simon?

46:32.867 --> 46:34.867
<i>Simon?</i>

46:34.994 --> 46:36.994
Simon?

46:38.420 --> 46:39.327
Simon?

46:39.427 --> 46:41.427
<i>Simon?</i>

46:42.567 --> 46:44.280
Simon?

46:44.380 --> 46:46.380
<i>Simon!</i>

46:47.412 --> 46:49.253
Si?

46:49.353 --> 46:51.353
<i>...mon!</i>

47:00.117 --> 47:01.627
I think we're just about ready to
resume the ceremony...

47:01.727 --> 47:03.211
Would you mind giving us five minutes?

47:03.311 --> 47:05.311
- Of course.
- Thanks.

47:10.196 --> 47:11.156
What's going on?

47:11.256 --> 47:13.237
I'm really sorry but I think
our moving out plans...

47:13.337 --> 47:15.762
...will have to be put on hold.
Just for a little while.

47:15.862 --> 47:16.500
What do you mean?
Why?

47:16.600 --> 47:17.754
I don't have time to explain
right now.

47:17.854 --> 47:19.800
I wouldn't do this unless
I really had to.

47:19.900 --> 47:20.856
What's the reason?

47:20.956 --> 47:23.676
I can't explain right now, okay?

47:32.013 --> 47:34.818
So you're the blackmailing prick.

47:36.455 --> 47:37.297
What're you doing with that?

47:37.397 --> 47:39.654
It's my manuscript.
It's not to be read by anyone.

47:39.754 --> 47:41.247
You shouldn't leave it
lying around, Daniel...

47:41.347 --> 47:42.630
...if you don't want people to
read it.

47:42.730 --> 47:43.426
This is my office.

47:43.526 --> 47:45.809
Guys! Can we just
get to the point?

47:45.909 --> 47:47.909
Fine by me.

47:51.309 --> 47:53.180
I'll write you this check and that's
the end of it. Yes?

47:53.280 --> 47:55.119
You give us the photos and you stay
out of our lives for ever.

47:55.219 --> 47:57.344
- Yeah?
- That's the deal.

48:13.546 --> 48:15.355
Is that your first attempt?

48:15.455 --> 48:16.239
What?

48:16.339 --> 48:17.798
That's your first novel
isn't it?

48:17.898 --> 48:19.789
Yeah.

48:19.889 --> 48:20.573
So?

48:20.673 --> 48:22.673
So, nothing.

48:22.957 --> 48:26.697
I tried to write once.
It didn't work for me.

48:27.047 --> 48:31.277
I think it's like a gift.
You either have it or you don't.

48:31.377 --> 48:33.033
It must be hard for you
though, Daniel...

48:33.133 --> 48:35.897
...living up to your brother's
reputation.

48:35.997 --> 48:39.578
Always living in the shadow
of a sibling like that.

48:39.678 --> 48:41.091
By the way...

48:41.191 --> 48:43.571
...I read your latest novel.

48:44.218 --> 48:46.218
Really good stuff.

48:46.662 --> 48:48.662
Thanks.

48:49.891 --> 48:51.891
Alright. That's it.

48:52.458 --> 48:53.941
Daniel, what the hell
are you doing?

48:54.041 --> 48:57.280
There's no way I'm giving this ass
a penny of my money.

48:57.380 --> 48:58.579
Don't be ridiculous.

48:58.679 --> 49:00.679
Why should I?

49:01.100 --> 49:02.566
He comes in here in the day
of our father's fuberal...

49:02.666 --> 49:04.649
...he tries to blackmail us
and bad mouths my novel.

49:04.749 --> 49:05.663
Who does he think he is?

49:05.763 --> 49:06.643
He has the photos.

49:06.743 --> 49:08.022
Let him show the photos.
I don't care.

49:08.122 --> 49:08.765
Daniel.

49:08.865 --> 49:10.709
No Robert.
I give up, okay?

49:10.809 --> 49:12.239
I give up.
I can't take anymore.

49:12.339 --> 49:16.759
If that's what he's going to do,
fine, let him do it.

49:17.768 --> 49:19.451
No problem.

49:19.551 --> 49:21.299
What?

49:21.399 --> 49:23.390
Wait, wait...

49:23.490 --> 49:25.645
Please, get out of my way.

49:25.745 --> 49:27.179
Let's discuss this
a minute.

49:27.279 --> 49:29.344
There's nothing to discuss.

49:29.444 --> 49:31.444
Get out of my way.

49:36.567 --> 49:38.607
Get up and help, Daniel!

49:40.123 --> 49:41.922
What are you doing Robert?

49:42.022 --> 49:43.474
Get a rope or something!

49:43.574 --> 49:45.170
We don't have any rope.

49:45.270 --> 49:46.733
Get something...

49:46.833 --> 49:48.873
There, from the curtain.

49:49.467 --> 49:50.400
Take it.

49:50.500 --> 49:52.500
Tie his legs.

49:54.685 --> 49:58.000
Jesus Robert.
This is a really bad idea.

50:37.206 --> 50:38.833
Fucking men.

50:38.933 --> 50:40.933
Tell me about it.

50:41.318 --> 50:42.743
Daniel, get that tie.

50:42.843 --> 50:43.270
Why?

50:43.370 --> 50:45.218
Just get it.

50:45.318 --> 50:46.593
What are we gonna
do with it?

50:46.693 --> 50:48.783
- Do whatever
- But I don't know.

50:48.883 --> 50:50.200
Stuff it in his mouth.

50:50.300 --> 50:51.065
This is ridiculous.

50:51.165 --> 50:52.364
Daniel?

50:52.464 --> 50:54.464
Jesus.
Shut the door!

50:54.764 --> 50:57.450
Why? What's going on?
Who's that?

50:57.550 --> 50:58.899
It's a seizure.

50:58.999 --> 51:00.572
God...really?

51:00.672 --> 51:02.793
I just found some Valium.

51:02.893 --> 51:03.669
Bring them here.

51:03.769 --> 51:04.537
How many?

51:04.637 --> 51:05.472
I don't know.

51:05.572 --> 51:06.353
A handful.

51:06.453 --> 51:08.453
Really? Okay.

51:10.148 --> 51:12.148
Wait, you dropped one.

51:12.853 --> 51:13.796
Open his mouth.

51:13.896 --> 51:15.120
Okay.

51:15.220 --> 51:17.210
It will be alright.

51:17.310 --> 51:18.744
Have you seen a little bottle?

51:18.844 --> 51:19.969
Jesus, Howard...

51:20.069 --> 51:21.657
...I told you to lock the
fucking door.

51:21.757 --> 51:22.956
You said to shut the
fucking door.

51:23.056 --> 51:23.717
What's going on?

51:23.817 --> 51:24.411
Oh, he's having a seizure.

51:24.511 --> 51:25.714
Seizure?

51:25.814 --> 51:27.814
Why is he all tied up?

51:36.918 --> 51:38.918
Hello.

51:40.143 --> 51:41.327
He's blackmailing you?
Over what?

51:41.427 --> 51:42.267
It doesn't matter now.

51:42.367 --> 51:43.246
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

51:43.346 --> 51:44.331
It's personal.

51:44.431 --> 51:45.017
Why?

51:45.117 --> 51:46.319
He said it's personal.

51:46.419 --> 51:47.000
But why?

51:47.100 --> 51:47.913
Just trust us.

51:48.013 --> 51:49.684
This is not a good guy.

51:49.784 --> 51:51.160
So, what are we gonna
do with him?

51:51.260 --> 51:53.518
- What're we gonna do?
- I don't know.

51:53.618 --> 51:55.126
What do you mean
you don't know?

51:55.226 --> 51:56.734
Shut up Daniel.
I've had enough.

51:56.834 --> 51:59.205
How long is the Valium
gonna last?

51:59.305 --> 51:59.805
What is it?

51:59.905 --> 52:00.895
- Valium?
- Yeah.

52:00.995 --> 52:02.666
Yeah, I found those Valium.

52:02.766 --> 52:06.591
We gave him a few to calm him
down. Thank you.

52:07.643 --> 52:09.215
Shit.

52:09.315 --> 52:11.315
What is it?

52:12.079 --> 52:12.988
What's wrong?

52:13.088 --> 52:15.088
Fuck!

52:16.577 --> 52:18.577
What?

52:21.466 --> 52:23.466
Thing is...

52:23.714 --> 52:25.628
...it's not really Valium.

52:25.728 --> 52:27.095
It's mostly acid.

52:27.195 --> 52:27.957
What?!

52:28.057 --> 52:30.264
Simon took one by mistake, that's
why he's acting like this.

52:30.364 --> 52:31.662
And what are you doing with this?

52:31.762 --> 52:32.643
They're for a friend.

52:32.743 --> 52:33.526
Wait a minute.

52:33.626 --> 52:34.606
You're telling us that..

52:34.706 --> 52:38.505
Martha's boyfriend who knocked over
Dad's coffin had just one of these things.

52:38.605 --> 52:39.507
And you gave him how many?

52:39.607 --> 52:41.503
Five.

52:41.603 --> 52:43.575
You can't blame me for this.

52:43.675 --> 52:44.535
Poor bastard.

52:44.635 --> 52:45.732
We should call an ambulance.

52:45.832 --> 52:47.115
Can't do that.
You'll be screwed.

52:47.215 --> 52:51.150
They're gonna find out he's been
force-fed hard drugs.

52:51.250 --> 52:53.428
What's gonna happen?
Is he gonna die?

52:53.528 --> 52:55.289
No.

52:55.389 --> 52:57.595
That is, I don't think so.

52:57.695 --> 52:59.691
<i>Daniel?</i>

53:01.910 --> 53:03.861
Robert?

53:03.961 --> 53:06.376
<i>We'll be out in a
minute, Mom.</i>

53:06.871 --> 53:08.059
We need to go outside.

53:08.159 --> 53:11.219
You two stay here
and look after him.

53:13.049 --> 53:13.748
Look after him?

53:13.848 --> 53:15.484
What do you mean?
What're we supposed to do?

53:15.584 --> 53:17.215
Make sure he doesn't escape.

53:17.315 --> 53:19.355
Lock the door behind us.

53:20.625 --> 53:21.847
Hi Mom.
How's it going?

53:21.947 --> 53:23.200
Reverend Davis needs to
speak to you.

53:23.300 --> 53:25.396
Can we resume the service now?

53:25.496 --> 53:27.207
I need to leave by 3.

53:27.307 --> 53:28.953
Yes, that's great. But we
need to have a chat.

53:29.053 --> 53:30.476
So can we take five more minutes?

53:30.576 --> 53:33.381
- Of course.
- Is there a problem?

53:33.641 --> 53:35.641
Jesus.

53:38.252 --> 53:42.077
Why didn't you just pay him
the fucking money?

53:47.120 --> 53:49.120
Where's my tea?

53:50.865 --> 53:52.865
What's your problem?

53:53.830 --> 53:55.830
Women.

53:56.369 --> 53:58.369
Women, women...

53:59.156 --> 54:01.715
Let me tell you something
about women.

54:01.815 --> 54:03.171
When I was a young man...

54:03.271 --> 54:07.243
...I use to go out with the most
beautiful woman in the village.

54:07.343 --> 54:10.005
She'd walk into the room
and everyone's eyes would turn.

54:10.105 --> 54:12.018
Everyone wanted to fuck her.

54:12.118 --> 54:15.433
And of course she
liked the attention...

54:16.575 --> 54:18.575
I have to take a shit.

54:24.746 --> 54:26.400
I can't believe you gave
him five pills.

54:26.500 --> 54:27.850
Who can we blame for this?

54:27.950 --> 54:30.109
Even if it was Valium, you should never
give him five. Don't you know anything?

54:30.209 --> 54:32.441
No, I don't know about
giving pills.

54:32.541 --> 54:34.541
<i>Hello?</i>

54:37.934 --> 54:39.404
Yes?

54:39.504 --> 54:41.504
<i>I need the toilet.</i>

54:42.610 --> 54:43.973
Could you use the
one upstairs?

54:44.073 --> 54:45.767
<i>I'm on a wheelchair you
fucking idiot.</i>

54:45.867 --> 54:47.766
<i>How am I supposed
to get upstairs?</i>

54:47.866 --> 54:49.866
<i>Open the door.</i>

54:50.742 --> 54:52.264
Wait a minute.

54:52.364 --> 54:53.231
God.

54:53.331 --> 54:54.229
What do we do?

54:54.329 --> 54:56.454
Put him behind the couch.

54:58.945 --> 55:00.455
We're looking for the key.

55:00.555 --> 55:02.512
Hurry.

55:02.612 --> 55:04.568
Shut up!

55:06.168 --> 55:07.214
<i>Hurry up!</i>

55:07.314 --> 55:09.314
Coming.

55:13.190 --> 55:13.803
Hello.

55:13.903 --> 55:17.133
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

55:17.805 --> 55:19.548
I'm about to shit
in my trousers.

55:19.648 --> 55:21.648
Come on.

55:25.056 --> 55:26.169
Justin, what is it now?

55:26.269 --> 55:27.768
Just want to talk to you.

55:27.868 --> 55:29.684
Please don't make me go
through this again.

55:29.784 --> 55:32.343
What are you so afraid
of, Martha?

55:32.443 --> 55:33.200
I know you feel the same way.

55:33.300 --> 55:34.720
You can't fight what
we had together.

55:34.820 --> 55:36.624
Justin, it was one night,
it was a massive mistake.

55:36.724 --> 55:40.237
I was drunk and out of my mind.
It could have been a donkey.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.148
What's he got that
I don't have?

55:42.248 --> 55:43.071
Okay.

55:43.171 --> 55:44.998
For one thing, he's responsible...

55:45.098 --> 55:47.017
...he's thoughtful,
he's intelligent...

55:47.117 --> 55:50.517
...he's stable...
Is that enough for you?

56:02.325 --> 56:04.277
Stop acting as if this is
all my fault.

56:04.377 --> 56:05.987
I'm not the one who attacked the guy
and tied him up.

56:06.087 --> 56:07.272
Someone had to look out
for Mom.

56:07.372 --> 56:09.330
I've been looking out for Mom
since you dissapeared...

56:09.430 --> 56:10.183
...and went to New York...

56:10.283 --> 56:12.768
...to fool around with your
celebrity friends.

56:12.868 --> 56:14.457
You're really unbelievable.

56:14.557 --> 56:15.872
You can't get over it,
can you?

56:15.972 --> 56:16.874
Get over what?

56:16.974 --> 56:18.545
You're burning with jealousy...

56:18.645 --> 56:21.679
...because you spend three years
working on a novel...

56:21.779 --> 56:22.946
...and you won't even let
anyone see it.

56:23.046 --> 56:24.312
And why should I?

56:24.412 --> 56:27.141
What will you do?
Wait until you're dead?

56:27.241 --> 56:29.242
And hope that it
gets published?

56:29.342 --> 56:30.698
You just write
common crap.

56:30.798 --> 56:31.980
It's not crap.

56:32.080 --> 56:32.830
You're a hypocrite.

56:32.930 --> 56:35.480
And you're the most selfish...

56:36.505 --> 56:38.545
Daniel, what's going on?

56:38.737 --> 56:39.846
This is your father's funeral.

56:39.946 --> 56:40.865
Not now, Jane.

56:40.965 --> 56:42.230
Why are you acting like this?

56:42.330 --> 56:44.330
Jane, not now...

56:46.626 --> 56:48.294
It's about the flat
isn't it?

56:48.394 --> 56:48.886
What?

56:48.986 --> 56:50.946
Because you don't want to go
do you?

56:51.046 --> 56:51.533
Jane...

56:51.633 --> 56:53.371
Tell her Daniel.

56:53.471 --> 56:55.471
Tell me what?

56:59.529 --> 57:01.968
Jane, do you remember
that short...

57:02.068 --> 57:03.623
...man, that I pointed at
earlier?

57:03.723 --> 57:04.416
- You remember?
- Yes.

57:04.516 --> 57:06.747
It turns out, he had an affair
with Dad.

57:06.847 --> 57:08.855
And now he's blackmailing us
into giving him 15,000 pounds...

57:08.955 --> 57:11.894
...or else he's going to show the
pictures where they're doing...stuff.

57:11.994 --> 57:13.994
- Sex stuff.
- Yeah.

57:15.845 --> 57:17.585
Is this some short
of a sick joke?

57:17.685 --> 57:20.320
Of course it's not a sick joke.

57:22.942 --> 57:24.942
Your father was gay?

57:25.567 --> 57:26.587
- Hurry up.
- I am...

57:26.687 --> 57:28.233
Hurry up.

57:28.333 --> 57:30.458
I'm going to go!
Hurry up!

57:30.728 --> 57:32.728
- Quick.
- Give me that.

57:32.998 --> 57:33.794
Lift me.
Help me.

57:33.894 --> 57:34.932
I am.

57:35.032 --> 57:36.042
Put your arms around me.

57:36.142 --> 57:37.339
Lift me.

57:37.439 --> 57:39.439
Christ!

57:39.590 --> 57:40.810
You weigh a ton.

57:40.910 --> 57:41.978
- You got me?
- Yes I've got you.

57:42.078 --> 57:42.944
Sure I got you.

57:43.044 --> 57:43.619
Quickly!

57:43.719 --> 57:45.428
Alright. I'm trying to see
where the toilet is.

57:45.528 --> 57:46.372
Get my trousers down.

57:46.472 --> 57:47.172
Shit...

57:47.272 --> 57:48.882
No, you do it.
I'll hold you.

57:48.982 --> 57:50.735
How can I do it?
I'm handicapped.

57:50.835 --> 57:52.453
Get it down!

57:52.553 --> 57:54.542
Fuck

57:54.642 --> 57:56.440
- Hurry up
- I am

57:56.540 --> 57:57.630
Alright, do it.

57:57.730 --> 57:59.227
Underpants, underpants...

57:59.327 --> 58:00.650
Move it, come on.

58:00.750 --> 58:02.750
Quick, quick...

58:02.853 --> 58:04.496
I have to go...
I have to go...

58:04.596 --> 58:06.153
it's down.
Everything is down!

58:06.253 --> 58:07.261
- Over there?
- I don't know.

58:07.361 --> 58:08.255
Over there?

58:08.355 --> 58:08.850
Yes.

58:08.950 --> 58:10.237
- Are you sure?
- Yes sit down!

58:10.337 --> 58:12.337
- Sure?
- Sit down!

58:13.424 --> 58:14.930
Sit down!

58:15.030 --> 58:15.949
Wait!
Wait a moment!

58:16.049 --> 58:18.049
Oh, that's better.

58:24.972 --> 58:26.972
God.

58:27.997 --> 58:29.035
God!

58:29.135 --> 58:30.428
What's with all the noise?

58:30.528 --> 58:32.528
Oh God!

58:42.750 --> 58:44.750
Howard?

58:46.612 --> 58:48.612
Howard?

58:49.677 --> 58:51.117
Please. Clean up!

58:51.217 --> 58:52.950
Howard?

58:53.050 --> 58:55.050
What?

58:55.250 --> 58:57.530
You missed a bit.

59:08.956 --> 59:12.421
The shit in your mouth will be the least
to worry about if we get caught.

59:12.521 --> 59:14.731
<i>I've got shit in my mouth?</i>

59:32.645 --> 59:34.645
Check him. Touch him.

59:36.878 --> 59:38.878
Are you alright mate?

59:40.202 --> 59:42.202
try again.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.191
Mate?

59:45.291 --> 59:45.983
<i>Mate?</i>

59:46.083 --> 59:48.083
Wake him up.

59:48.271 --> 59:49.366
Mate.

59:49.466 --> 59:50.253
What's his name?

59:50.353 --> 59:52.353
I don't know.

59:52.776 --> 59:54.776
try Philip.

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:04.424
<i>Philip?</i>

01:00:09.877 --> 01:00:11.877
Philip?
Wake up mate.

01:00:12.149 --> 01:00:13.194
Are you okay?

01:00:13.294 --> 01:00:13.961
Shit.

01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:16.061
Philip?

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:20.475
He might not be a Philip.

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:22.575
Maybe something else.

01:00:22.978 --> 01:00:24.178
Pinch him.

01:00:24.278 --> 01:00:26.278
Please.
Pinch him.

01:00:29.808 --> 01:00:31.808
Mate?

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.270
<i>I think he's breathing.</i>

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:39.469
What?

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.569
He must be breathing.

01:00:53.794 --> 01:00:55.794
Shit.

01:00:55.894 --> 01:00:57.893
- Is he okay?
- No.

01:01:00.739 --> 01:01:02.739
He's dead.

01:01:06.928 --> 01:01:09.145
If that's the way it is,
we have to give him the money.

01:01:09.245 --> 01:01:11.408
It's not that simple.

01:01:11.508 --> 01:01:12.158
Why not?

01:01:12.258 --> 01:01:14.036
Daniel refused to pay, so...

01:01:14.136 --> 01:01:15.782
...we're completely fucked.

01:01:15.882 --> 01:01:17.882
Just shut up.

01:01:30.673 --> 01:01:32.673
Sorry.

01:01:36.504 --> 01:01:39.054
Hi, sorry, may I come through?

01:01:42.234 --> 01:01:44.869
Just getting through.
Thank you.

01:01:53.124 --> 01:01:56.184
Why are you smiling like that
Howard?

01:01:57.555 --> 01:01:59.042
I wonder if I could
ask you too...

01:01:59.142 --> 01:02:02.107
...come to the study for a second?

01:02:06.212 --> 01:02:08.047
We'll be back soon.

01:02:08.147 --> 01:02:10.147
Alright.

01:02:12.542 --> 01:02:14.542
<i>It's Howard.</i>

01:02:21.197 --> 01:02:23.197
Jesus.
What is this?

01:02:24.588 --> 01:02:26.000
It's...
Call Uncle Victor.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:26.835
No point.

01:02:26.935 --> 01:02:27.664
What do you mean?

01:02:27.764 --> 01:02:30.144
Look at him.
He's stone dead.

01:02:34.085 --> 01:02:36.582
What the hell did
you do to him?!

01:02:36.682 --> 01:02:37.485
We didn't do anything.

01:02:37.585 --> 01:02:39.157
He hit his head on the corner.

01:02:39.257 --> 01:02:40.871
Hit his head on the corner?

01:02:40.971 --> 01:02:44.379
He hit his head. That's what happened.
Why? What do you think?

01:02:44.479 --> 01:02:45.542
This is really bad.

01:02:45.642 --> 01:02:46.970
This is really, really bad.

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:48.004
What're we gonna do?

01:02:48.104 --> 01:02:49.325
Actually, I really got to go.

01:02:49.425 --> 01:02:50.484
You're not going anywhere.

01:02:50.584 --> 01:02:52.411
I can't go to prison.

01:02:52.511 --> 01:02:55.489
You have any idea what they do to
blokes like me in prison?

01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:57.287
<i>I can't go to prison</i>

01:02:57.387 --> 01:02:59.387
Howard. Just calm down.

01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:05.751
Now...

01:03:07.334 --> 01:03:09.702
Nobody here knows, who this
guy is right?

01:03:09.802 --> 01:03:11.409
They don't even
know his name.

01:03:11.509 --> 01:03:13.492
Probably didn't even
notice him.

01:03:13.592 --> 01:03:16.114
Didn't notice him?
He's four fucking feet tall.

01:03:16.214 --> 01:03:20.208
Alright. We'll just get rid of the body
as if he came and left.

01:03:20.308 --> 01:03:21.950
Get rid of the body?

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.470
What are you talking about?

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:26.030
What do we know about
getting rid of bodies?

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:30.825
What are you gonna do. Will you
throw him out in the rubbish?

01:03:30.925 --> 01:03:32.260
Any of you happened to notice...

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.420
...the size of Uncle Eddie's coffin?

01:03:36.471 --> 01:03:39.977
Are you suggesting that we bury
him with my father?

01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:41.527
Why not?

01:03:41.627 --> 01:03:44.140
it's not like he's gonna
know, is he?

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.322
That's not the point.

01:03:48.578 --> 01:03:50.578
it makes sense Daniel.

01:03:51.071 --> 01:03:52.894
The coffin is there, the hole in the
ground is there...

01:03:52.994 --> 01:03:55.089
...they go, and that's all.
End of story.

01:03:55.189 --> 01:03:58.079
Unless you got
a better suggestion.

01:04:08.513 --> 01:04:09.602
I mean, come on look...

01:04:09.702 --> 01:04:11.470
...you got to do whatever it
is in life

01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:13.071
...that get you up the most.

01:04:13.171 --> 01:04:14.017
Yeah.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:16.869
But maybe I don't consider my life
anymore as being me,me,me...

01:04:16.969 --> 01:04:20.451
...maybe I've discovered something out
of myself that I care about.

01:04:20.551 --> 01:04:22.849
And maybe you should do it
too, Justin.

01:04:22.949 --> 01:04:26.159
That's a bit harsh, 'cause
I really care about you.

01:04:26.259 --> 01:04:28.284
No Justin. You care
about you.

01:04:28.384 --> 01:04:30.133
You care about me in relation
to how I affect you.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:32.233
There's a difference.

01:04:32.347 --> 01:04:34.347
No. That's not true.

01:04:34.886 --> 01:04:36.886
Martha.

01:04:39.962 --> 01:04:40.973
I love you Martha.

01:04:41.073 --> 01:04:43.073
No Justin, you don't...

01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:47.996
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:49.899
Simon!

01:04:49.999 --> 01:04:51.709
Simon.

01:04:51.809 --> 01:04:52.792
Simon?

01:04:52.892 --> 01:04:54.377
Simon what the hell
are you doing?

01:04:54.477 --> 01:04:56.607
Come back here and put your clothes
on, this instant!

01:04:56.707 --> 01:04:57.823
I show you kissing him.

01:04:57.923 --> 01:04:59.844
I wasn't kissing him.
I promise you.

01:04:59.944 --> 01:05:02.172
What're you doing?
We're in a bloody funeral.

01:05:02.272 --> 01:05:03.309
I'll jump.

01:05:03.409 --> 01:05:05.149
- Don't be silly.
- I'll jump right now!

01:05:05.249 --> 01:05:06.717
I swear to you.

01:05:06.817 --> 01:05:07.697
Simon don't be like this.

01:05:07.797 --> 01:05:10.610
Do you remember? Drugs.
You got drugs in you.

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:12.413
Just calm down.

01:05:12.513 --> 01:05:13.581
Simon, look at me.

01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:16.739
Justin, will you get
the fuck out of here?!

01:05:16.839 --> 01:05:18.210
<i>I'm going to do it</i>

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:19.912
<i>I will jump</i>

01:05:20.012 --> 01:05:21.791
- Simon look at me!
- I swear I am

01:05:21.891 --> 01:05:23.205
Please calm down.

01:05:23.305 --> 01:05:26.110
- Simon, please.
- I'm gonna jump!

01:05:26.426 --> 01:05:29.826
I'm going to jump...
I'm going to jump...

01:05:31.046 --> 01:05:33.617
This is impossible we cannot do it.

01:05:33.717 --> 01:05:35.074
<i>Howard?</i>

01:05:35.174 --> 01:05:36.139
<i>Is that you?</i>

01:05:36.239 --> 01:05:36.878
Shit

01:05:36.978 --> 01:05:37.720
<i>Are you in there?</i>

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.420
Yeah.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.070
Hurry get him in the bathroom.

01:05:44.597 --> 01:05:46.597
<i>Howard?</i>

01:05:51.624 --> 01:05:53.624
- Oh shit
- What's that?

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.975
Howard, what the fuck is Uncle Alfie
doing on the toilet?

01:05:57.075 --> 01:05:57.881
I forgot him.

01:05:57.981 --> 01:05:59.031
How could you forget?

01:05:59.131 --> 01:06:00.159
What's wrong with you?

01:06:00.259 --> 01:06:02.259
<i>Open the door</i>

01:06:03.519 --> 01:06:04.109
What is it?

01:06:04.209 --> 01:06:05.213
Hi, Daniel.
Where's Howard?

01:06:05.313 --> 01:06:06.130
I'm here.

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.784
Howard, come see this.

01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:10.604
Simon's totally fucking lost it.

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:14.791
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:17.545
Simon is on the roof.
He's totally fucking naked.

01:06:17.645 --> 01:06:19.128
He's threatening to jump.

01:06:19.228 --> 01:06:19.952
Jesus.

01:06:20.052 --> 01:06:20.816
Where are you going?

01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:22.001
I have to go out there.

01:06:22.101 --> 01:06:23.878
If he jumps, I'm fucked.

01:06:23.978 --> 01:06:25.978
Wait here.

01:06:34.737 --> 01:06:36.490
<i>Simon, you're not going to jump.</i>

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:39.100
I'll jump.
I'm not listening to you.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.240
<i>Simon, get back in here.</i>

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:45.366
Simon come inside and
we'll have a cop of tea.

01:06:45.466 --> 01:06:46.274
No.

01:06:46.374 --> 01:06:47.276
Simon.

01:06:47.376 --> 01:06:49.376
Simon!

01:06:55.566 --> 01:06:57.566
<i>Simon.</i>

01:07:04.742 --> 01:07:05.559
Martha.

01:07:05.659 --> 01:07:07.589
What the hell are you doing?

01:07:07.689 --> 01:07:09.689
Simon.

01:07:14.081 --> 01:07:16.081
Martha!

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.540
<i>Get down from there.</i>

01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:20.848
What's happening?

01:07:20.948 --> 01:07:22.109
I think I can get rid
of this guy...

01:07:22.209 --> 01:07:23.650
...but I need you to stay outside...

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:24.793
...and make sure no one comes in.

01:07:24.893 --> 01:07:26.371
Okay.

01:07:26.471 --> 01:07:28.471
<i>Martha.</i>

01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.866
Who is it?

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:34.426
<i>It's Daniel</i>

01:07:34.526 --> 01:07:36.457
Everyone's in the garden, we have
to move the body now.

01:07:36.557 --> 01:07:38.557
Brilliant.

01:07:42.878 --> 01:07:44.878
Okay.
Quick.

01:07:45.089 --> 01:07:45.705
Howard.

01:07:45.805 --> 01:07:46.934
Stay here and make sure
no one comes in.

01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:49.034
Okay.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.495
Hello Reverend.
How are you?

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.885
How is God doing...today?

01:08:03.043 --> 01:08:04.416
God is a funny one, isn't he?

01:08:04.516 --> 01:08:05.276
Excuse me.

01:08:05.376 --> 01:08:07.376
Yeah, okay

01:08:07.952 --> 01:08:09.365
Daniel, we have to do this, right?

01:08:09.465 --> 01:08:11.465
Yeah.

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:16.591
I wanted to ask you
about religion...

01:08:16.691 --> 01:08:18.792
...and how could I become a priest
if I wanted to...

01:08:18.892 --> 01:08:20.250
...because I've seen you today,
and you're amazing.

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:22.350
I'm glad to hear that.

01:08:22.935 --> 01:08:25.910
God, we can't leave them like that.

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:32.243
You know, in a strange way, maybe this
is what Dad wanted.

01:08:32.344 --> 01:08:34.903
For God's sake Robert.
Can't you take anything seriously?

01:08:35.002 --> 01:08:38.136
Sundays, is it true...

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:42.792
...the wine is sweeter...

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:44.332
...or not?

01:08:44.433 --> 01:08:46.492
Listen, we'll deal with this later.

01:08:46.591 --> 01:08:49.057
I'd like to get to the phone.

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:53.014
Why do you say I can't take
anything seriously?

01:08:53.113 --> 01:08:53.917
I'll tell you why.

01:08:54.017 --> 01:08:55.569
Because you disappear half way
around the world...

01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:57.371
...and you hardly ever come back
to see your parents.

01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:59.930
Because you spend the last of
your money on a 1st class ticket...

01:09:00.029 --> 01:09:01.850
...when you know you're supposed
to give me the half for the funeral.

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:04.514
Because you live your life as if you're
on a fairground...

01:09:04.613 --> 01:09:08.569
...and 'cause you never ever, gave
a shit about anyone but yourself.

01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:10.881
I didn't know anything about this
disturbed young man on the roof.

01:09:10.982 --> 01:09:14.749
I have a confession to make.
I have these thoughts about...

01:09:14.849 --> 01:09:17.059
...sticking a pen
up my bum.

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:19.377
You're what?

01:09:19.477 --> 01:09:22.197
Simon, this is really dangerous.

01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:25.249
Please.

01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:27.307
Leave me alone.

01:09:27.407 --> 01:09:29.386
Sit there.

01:09:46.872 --> 01:09:49.082
I'll never be good enough.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:52.850
Not for your dad, not for you
I'll never be rich enough...

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:54.379
...I'll never be cool enough.

01:09:54.479 --> 01:09:56.838
Simon, stop talking this nonsense
and just come inside.

01:09:56.938 --> 01:09:58.977
No, you go inside.

01:09:59.322 --> 01:09:59.954
Come with me.

01:10:00.054 --> 01:10:02.054
No. Why?

01:10:05.115 --> 01:10:07.750
'Cause we're gonna have a baby.

01:10:11.475 --> 01:10:13.475
What?

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:16.956
We'll have a child together.

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:22.392
You're pregnant?

01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:25.637
How would I be able to it
without you?

01:10:51.023 --> 01:10:55.273
- What's that? Excuse me.
- I don't know...Now look...

01:10:59.639 --> 01:11:01.639
Bye Dad.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.340
We're gonna have a baby!

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.639
Jesus.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:28.083
Listen to me everyone.
Simon is off the roof.

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:30.183
I will kill him.

01:11:43.042 --> 01:11:43.710
is he gone?

01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:45.378
Yeah.

01:11:45.478 --> 01:11:47.478
Thank God.

01:11:54.305 --> 01:11:55.178
Thank you.

01:11:55.278 --> 01:11:56.691
<i>Martha!</i>

01:11:56.791 --> 01:11:58.791
<i>Martha, open the door.</i>

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:04.086
Thank God, you're safe.

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:07.055
You idiot.
What were you thinking?!

01:12:07.155 --> 01:12:09.236
I want you to stay away
from my daughter.

01:12:09.336 --> 01:12:09.973
Look Dad...

01:12:10.073 --> 01:12:11.042
Martha, stay out of this.

01:12:11.142 --> 01:12:12.949
Dad, we're getting married.

01:12:13.049 --> 01:12:13.825
What?

01:12:13.925 --> 01:12:15.925
We're getting married.

01:12:17.961 --> 01:12:19.118
Martha.

01:12:19.218 --> 01:12:21.861
You don't have to marry this man
just because you're pregnant.

01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:23.225
We can deal with this Martha.

01:12:23.325 --> 01:12:25.994
I'm marrying him because
I love him.

01:12:26.094 --> 01:12:27.738
- You can't
- Yes, I can.

01:12:27.838 --> 01:12:29.189
It's my life and this
is my choice.

01:12:29.289 --> 01:12:34.049
And I'm sorry if you don't like it
but that's just tough.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.231
And I will tell you
something else.

01:12:36.331 --> 01:12:38.339
If you don't short out
your attitude...

01:12:38.439 --> 01:12:42.774
...you're gonna end up a very lonely
bitter old man.

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.260
Dad.

01:12:53.343 --> 01:12:55.528
Darling, we really must
start again now.

01:12:55.628 --> 01:12:57.944
Daniel, have you seen
Uncle Alfie?

01:12:58.044 --> 01:13:00.044
Shit

01:13:11.997 --> 01:13:13.600
What the hell is going on
in there?

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.725
Sorry we forgot you.

01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:16.868
Never mind that. What about that dead
body, you were dragging over there?

01:13:16.968 --> 01:13:17.923
What dead body?

01:13:18.023 --> 01:13:21.140
Don't fuck with me.
I saw a dead body!

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.441
Get me the hell of this
fucking toilet!

01:13:36.869 --> 01:13:38.877
Did you hear that?
She's having a kid.

01:13:38.977 --> 01:13:40.620
I would have done it, if I didn't
know she was having a kid.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.385
I thought you were in
love with her.

01:13:41.485 --> 01:13:44.209
Yeah, but can you imagine me
bringing up a kid?

01:13:44.309 --> 01:13:44.952
No.

01:13:45.052 --> 01:13:45.940
Exactly.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:46.970
How's your skin thing?

01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.768
Oh, that...

01:13:47.868 --> 01:13:49.311
It's probably nothing.
To be honest, I'm more concerned about

01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:53.321
...about having Uncle Alfie's shit
in my mouth.

01:14:04.683 --> 01:14:05.670
<i>He was dead.</i>

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:08.455
<i>Why don't you listen, I tell
you, I saw the guy.</i>

01:14:08.555 --> 01:14:09.552
He was dead.

01:14:09.652 --> 01:14:12.864
<i>I know you did Uncle Alfie.
We all did.</i>

01:14:12.964 --> 01:14:15.426
No, in the bathroom. The door
opened and I saw him.

01:14:15.526 --> 01:14:18.064
What a nightmare today's been.

01:14:18.164 --> 01:14:19.894
But exciting, isn't it?

01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:22.049
- What?
- For a funeral I mean.

01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:23.792
About the flat, I promised to call them.

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.892
And I will.

01:14:26.008 --> 01:14:28.008
We'll work it out.

01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:30.403
We really have to wheeze
through this now.

01:14:30.503 --> 01:14:31.206
Alright. Let's go.

01:14:31.306 --> 01:14:32.322
You want to have the casket open
for people...

01:14:32.422 --> 01:14:33.310
No.

01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:34.295
Alright. That's fine.

01:14:34.395 --> 01:14:37.241
Sit down everybody, as quick as
you can. We're ready to go.

01:14:37.341 --> 01:14:39.341
Come along. Come on.

01:14:40.826 --> 01:14:42.559
That's it.

01:14:42.659 --> 01:14:43.718
Quickly!

01:14:43.818 --> 01:14:45.181
Come on, come on...

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:47.281
Come on!

01:14:47.667 --> 01:14:49.667
Come on!
Come on!

01:14:51.895 --> 01:14:54.570
I'd like to apologise on behalf of the
family for all of the distractions...

01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:56.990
...and that everyone is ready to
continue with the service...

01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:58.779
...and Daniel would like to say a few
words about his father.

01:14:58.879 --> 01:15:00.879
Go on Daniel. Quickly.

01:15:16.882 --> 01:15:20.150
My father was an
exceptional man.

01:15:40.279 --> 01:15:43.583
My father was an
exceptional man.

01:15:53.279 --> 01:15:56.271
He was born in 1938
just a year before the war.

01:15:56.371 --> 01:15:58.411
And I'll never forget...

01:16:00.166 --> 01:16:01.692
What the hell is going on?

01:16:01.792 --> 01:16:03.274
There's someone in there.

01:16:03.374 --> 01:16:05.374
I knew it!

01:16:13.678 --> 01:16:16.389
What the hell are you doing
in my dad's coffin?

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:19.852
Edward.

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.340
No, no...

01:16:23.755 --> 01:16:24.920
Edward.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:25.899
Edward!

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:32.415
No.

01:16:45.658 --> 01:16:47.813
You little bastard!

01:16:51.743 --> 01:16:53.189
Oh God.

01:16:53.289 --> 01:16:56.094
My father was an exceptional man.

01:17:19.173 --> 01:17:21.978
He may not have been
a perfect man.

01:17:22.276 --> 01:17:24.347
But he was a good man.

01:17:25.648 --> 01:17:27.648
And he loved us.

01:17:32.013 --> 01:17:33.400
All I wanted to do today
was to give him a dignified...

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.985
...sending.
Is that really so much to ask?

01:17:42.634 --> 01:17:44.634
So...

01:17:46.449 --> 01:17:48.449
Maybe...

01:17:49.924 --> 01:17:52.822
Maybe he had some things
he liked to do.

01:17:52.922 --> 01:17:55.897
Life isn't simple.
It's complicated.

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.631
We're all just thrown in
here together...

01:18:00.731 --> 01:18:04.216
...in a world full of chaos and
confusion.

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.696
A world full of questions and
no answers.

01:18:07.796 --> 01:18:10.394
With Death always lingering
around the corner.

01:18:10.494 --> 01:18:12.494
And we do our best.

01:18:14.518 --> 01:18:16.510
We can't always do our best.

01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:18.995
My dad did it best.

01:18:30.993 --> 01:18:32.890
He always tried to tell me you
have to go for what you want in life...

01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:34.644
...because you never know how long
you're gonna be here.

01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:38.251
And whether you succeed
or you fail...

01:18:39.674 --> 01:18:43.414
...the most important thing
is to have tried.

01:18:44.538 --> 01:18:48.091
A parent can only drive you in the
right direction. In the end though...

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:51.081
...you've got to run for yourself.

01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:56.615
You have to grow up yourself.

01:19:01.907 --> 01:19:04.457
So when you leave
here today...

01:19:05.475 --> 01:19:10.575
...I'd like you to remember my father
for what he really was.

01:19:10.904 --> 01:19:13.294
A decent and loving man.

01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:21.496
If only we could be as
giving and generous..

01:19:22.252 --> 01:19:25.397
...and understanding
as my father was.

01:19:26.589 --> 01:19:30.159
Then the world would be a far
better place.

01:20:07.654 --> 01:20:09.654
How's Mom?

01:20:11.052 --> 01:20:13.052
She'll survive.

01:20:16.226 --> 01:20:17.932
The positive side is...

01:20:18.032 --> 01:20:23.217
...that she knows why she and Dad
haven't had sex for so long.

01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:28.987
I asked to come to New York
with me, for a while.

01:20:29.087 --> 01:20:32.829
So that you and Jane have a chance...
to breathe a bit.

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:34.929
Get a flat...

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:43.112
Pretty good speech you gave,
by the way.

01:20:43.212 --> 01:20:45.217
It was really...

01:20:49.794 --> 01:20:51.794
...impressive.

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.781
Thanks.

01:20:58.116 --> 01:21:01.045
Maybe when you got time
you wouldn't mind...

01:21:01.145 --> 01:21:03.412
...taking a look at my novel.

01:21:03.512 --> 01:21:05.512
I'd love to, yeah.

01:21:13.232 --> 01:21:15.232
I'm exhausted actually.

01:21:15.445 --> 01:21:18.656
Uncle Alfie keeps going on
about the body in the bathroom.

01:21:18.756 --> 01:21:20.870
It's best if he stays
here tonight.

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:22.971
You think he'll be okay?

01:21:23.071 --> 01:21:28.982
Yeah, he'll be fine. I found him a
couple of Valium and put him to bed.

01:21:30.133 --> 01:21:32.768
Everything's so
fucking green...
