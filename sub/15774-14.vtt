[whistle blowing on TV]

00:10.880 --> 00:12.989
- Unh.
- What's up, doc?

00:13.023 --> 00:14.793
- I need to borrow
your TV.

00:14.828 --> 00:16.094
Beg your pardon?

00:16.129 --> 00:17.496
- I got a date
with a cute little filly,

00:17.530 --> 00:19.365
And she's coming over
for movie night.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.036
- What's wrong
with your TV?

00:21.071 --> 00:23.974
- It's a 1952
black and white set.

00:24.008 --> 00:25.810
Ain't got no surround sound.

00:25.845 --> 00:27.780
Ain't got
no high definition.

00:27.814 --> 00:28.947
I'm trying to impress her.

00:28.982 --> 00:31.850
- Sam, I'm not gonna
help you lie to some girl

00:31.885 --> 00:34.452
So you can trick her
into dating you.

00:34.486 --> 00:36.186
Fine.

00:36.221 --> 00:39.522
Ooh, what about
your Nobel Prize?

00:39.556 --> 00:41.424
That'd seal the deal.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.325
No.

00:45.361 --> 00:46.226
What kind of weirdo

00:46.261 --> 00:48.395
would pretend to have
won the Nobel Prize?

00:48.429 --> 00:50.029
[camera clicks]

00:50.064 --> 00:50.797
[click]

00:50.831 --> 00:52.365
- Pretty good
status update, huh?

00:52.400 --> 00:53.300
[laughing]
oh, yeah.

00:53.334 --> 00:55.969
I'm gonna get a lot
of "likes" on this one.

Zero "likes."

Speedy Gonzales.

01:31.433 --> 01:34.035
Eh, we're here.

01:34.537 --> 01:35.670
Where?

01:35.705 --> 01:37.539
- Th-the seminar. You
said you'd go with me.

01:37.573 --> 01:40.844
Wieb Lunk, renowned
motivational speaker.

01:40.878 --> 01:42.846
His first book,
"Walking Through Fire,"

01:42.880 --> 01:45.482
Kept me going when
I lost my accounting job.

01:45.516 --> 01:48.052
It's what motivated me
to take up catering.

01:48.086 --> 01:51.489
- You're saying you need
someone else to motivate you?

01:51.524 --> 01:53.291
Ha! That is so weak.

01:53.325 --> 01:55.528
[car door opens and closes]

01:55.795 --> 01:58.030
We parked so far away.

01:58.298 --> 02:01.134
I don't think I can make it
to the entrance.

02:01.169 --> 02:02.169
[sighs]

02:02.203 --> 02:03.404
Of course you can.

02:03.438 --> 02:04.672
You really think so?

02:04.706 --> 02:06.106
I believe in you.

02:06.141 --> 02:07.074
All right.

02:07.108 --> 02:08.741
But just keep motivating me.

02:08.776 --> 02:10.344
- You can do it.
You can do it.

02:10.377 --> 02:11.545
Ohh. Ahh.

02:11.579 --> 02:13.046
Almost there.

02:13.081 --> 02:14.881
Ahh.

02:14.916 --> 02:17.785
- Are you ready
to change your life?

02:17.819 --> 02:20.021
- Let's get one thing
straight, bub.

02:20.055 --> 02:22.757
I'm only here
for free coffee.

02:23.992 --> 02:28.295
This hokum only works on
weak-minded suckers like you.

02:30.999 --> 02:32.766
Whoa!

02:32.801 --> 02:35.336
That was amazing!

02:35.370 --> 02:36.703
I'm a changed man.

02:36.738 --> 02:40.073
I can't believe it took
so long to see the light.

02:40.108 --> 02:42.676
- I'm excited to read
his new book,

02:42.710 --> 02:45.111
"Spread Those Wings and Fly."

02:45.145 --> 02:46.112
I can't wait to fly.

02:46.146 --> 02:47.747
I mean, I've always been
a little afraid of it,

02:47.782 --> 02:50.618
But like Wieb says,
"it's now or never."

02:50.652 --> 02:52.253
I'm gonna sign up today.

02:52.287 --> 02:53.554
Uh, for what?

02:53.588 --> 02:55.056
Flying lessons.

02:55.090 --> 02:56.224
Uh, Daffy.

02:56.258 --> 02:58.593
[stammering] I think you're
taking the title of the book

02:58.628 --> 02:59.728
Too literally.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.229
- What are you
talking about?

03:01.263 --> 03:02.698
He must have said
the word "fly"

03:02.732 --> 03:04.266
About 100 times
in there.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.468
"Fly" means "fly,"

03:05.502 --> 03:07.970
Which is exactly what
I'm going to do.

03:08.004 --> 03:09.672
You mean like...

03:09.706 --> 03:13.109
- Porky, I've told you
I'm not that kind of duck.

03:13.143 --> 03:15.044
I'm going to get
my pilot's license.

03:15.078 --> 03:17.279
I've already got
a driver's license

03:17.314 --> 03:19.048
And a cosmetology license.

03:19.082 --> 03:21.317
That's 2
of the big 5 licenses.

03:21.351 --> 03:22.952
The big 5 licenses?

03:22.986 --> 03:26.088
- Driver's license,
cosmetology license,

03:26.123 --> 03:28.891
Pilot's license,
fishing license,

03:28.926 --> 03:30.860
And license to kill.

03:30.894 --> 03:32.361
I can't wait
to get that one.

03:32.396 --> 03:33.696
Now, get out of my way.

03:33.730 --> 03:35.431
I never want
to see you again.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.365
Uh, what?

03:36.399 --> 03:37.633
- Well, at least
for a while.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.935
Wieb said to get rid
of any friends or family

03:39.969 --> 03:41.003
Who don't support you.

03:41.037 --> 03:44.339
Those people are toxic,
like mold.

03:44.374 --> 03:45.874
You're mold, Porky.

03:45.908 --> 03:48.143
You've been here
this whole time,

03:48.177 --> 03:50.212
Slowly killing me.

03:50.246 --> 03:51.646
I do support you.

03:51.681 --> 03:54.483
I just think "Spread
Those Wings and Fly"

03:54.517 --> 03:55.951
Is a metaphor.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.286
Really? For what?

03:57.320 --> 04:00.055
- Finding the courage
to pursue your dreams,

04:00.090 --> 04:01.757
Listening to
your inner voice,

04:01.791 --> 04:05.260
Having the confidence
to try something new,

04:05.295 --> 04:06.895
Take risks,

04:06.930 --> 04:09.665
Live boldly.

04:09.699 --> 04:11.733
You are so dumb.

04:11.768 --> 04:13.869
Dumb and toxic.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.709
Flying lessons?

04:20.744 --> 04:23.146
- It's in my genes,
my blood.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.747
I'm meant to fly.

04:24.782 --> 04:25.848
I'm a duck.

04:25.883 --> 04:27.250
Birds are angels on earth.

04:27.284 --> 04:29.819
You don't understand
because you're a rabbit,

04:29.854 --> 04:30.887
A rodent, vermin.

04:30.921 --> 04:32.456
You're a garbage eater.

04:32.490 --> 04:33.590
[whirring]

04:33.625 --> 04:34.625
What is that?

04:34.659 --> 04:37.161
- Lunk formula. It's a
mixture of synthetic carbs

04:37.195 --> 04:38.662
And branch chain
amino acids.

04:38.697 --> 04:41.700
Wieb says it increases
brain function.

04:41.734 --> 04:42.734
[gulping]

04:42.769 --> 04:45.404
- Might want to put
another scoop in there.

04:45.972 --> 04:47.740
- I already cut Porky
out of my life.

04:47.774 --> 04:49.942
I can do the Same to you.

04:50.810 --> 04:51.910
I don't want to.

04:51.944 --> 04:52.910
I mean, you're the one

04:52.945 --> 04:54.645
With the house
and all the cool stuff.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.113
But I will.

04:56.148 --> 04:57.414
[click]
- DVD 4.

04:57.449 --> 05:00.016
" how high can you fly?"

05:00.051 --> 05:00.984
Very high.

05:01.018 --> 05:02.819
- Right now,
I want you to tell me

05:02.854 --> 05:05.388
If you're satisfied
with your life.

05:05.422 --> 05:06.422
No.

05:06.457 --> 05:08.557
- Are you satisfied
with your career?

05:08.592 --> 05:09.759
No.

05:09.793 --> 05:12.594
- Satisfied in
your relationships?

05:12.628 --> 05:14.162
No. All no.

05:14.196 --> 05:15.964
- Then I want you
to stand up

05:15.998 --> 05:16.798
And say it with me.

05:16.832 --> 05:20.135
- I'm gonna spread
my wings and fly.

05:20.169 --> 05:23.704
- I'm gonna spread my wings and what?
- Fly.

05:23.739 --> 05:24.939
- What?
- Fly.

05:24.973 --> 05:27.374
- I--I can't hear you.
- Fly.

05:27.409 --> 05:28.575
- What?
- Fly.

05:28.609 --> 05:29.576
- What?
- Fly.

05:29.610 --> 05:32.111
- Do you really need to be
doing this right now?

05:32.146 --> 05:34.046
- Good point.
I should get to bed.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.814
Listen to my
nighttime nuggets.

05:35.849 --> 05:37.815
- Your what?
- Nighttime nuggets.

05:37.850 --> 05:39.850
They're little
inspirational bullet points

05:39.884 --> 05:42.185
That subliminally sink in
while I sleep.

05:42.219 --> 05:44.354
If you want to watch
the DVDs, go ahead.

05:44.388 --> 05:45.554
They'll change your life.

05:45.588 --> 05:47.356
- No thanks.
- Suit yourself.

05:47.390 --> 05:50.358
But you'll never soar,
my ground-bound friend.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.526
You'll never be a Lunkhead.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.428
- I don't want to be
a Lunkhead.

05:54.463 --> 05:57.531
- Who wouldn't want to be
a Lunkhead?

05:57.565 --> 05:59.766
[crickets chirping]

06:02.904 --> 06:05.539
Wow. I feel so rested,

06:05.573 --> 06:07.007
So invigorated.

06:07.042 --> 06:10.778
Looks like
a beautiful day to fly.

06:17.385 --> 06:18.818
What are you wearing?

06:18.853 --> 06:20.420
- Dress for the job
you want,

06:20.454 --> 06:21.788
Not the job you have.

06:21.822 --> 06:23.022
You don't have a job.

06:23.057 --> 06:26.026
- That's why
I'm usually nude.

06:28.729 --> 06:30.430
- Why is
the front door open?

06:30.464 --> 06:31.564
I don't know.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.702
- I think someone
broke into the house.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.960
- Is anything missing?
- I don't think so.

06:42.011 --> 06:44.446
[gasps] my Nobel Prize!

06:44.480 --> 06:46.115
Unbelievable.

06:46.149 --> 06:47.149
What?

06:47.183 --> 06:49.418
- That hillbilly leprechaun
stole my Nobel Prize.

06:49.453 --> 06:51.654
- You know
a hillbilly leprechaun?

06:51.688 --> 06:54.157
[yelling] Yosemite.

06:54.191 --> 06:58.494
- Yosemite knows
a hillbilly leprechaun?

06:59.162 --> 07:00.563
[knocking]

07:00.597 --> 07:03.132
- Give it back.
- Give what back?

07:03.166 --> 07:04.166
My Nobel Prize.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.902
- Uh, I don't got
your Nobel Prize.

07:06.936 --> 07:08.003
Sure you don't.

07:08.037 --> 07:09.204
- Why do you think
I took it?

07:09.238 --> 07:12.007
'cause I came there yesterday
and said I wanted it?

07:12.042 --> 07:14.643
And you said, "no,"
and I left angrily?

07:14.677 --> 07:16.544
Or 'cause of my
vast criminal record,

07:16.579 --> 07:18.847
Which includes
breaking and entering?

07:18.881 --> 07:19.914
Yep, either of those.

07:19.948 --> 07:22.984
- Well, I didn't steal
your stupid prize.

07:23.018 --> 07:24.319
Now, get off'n
my property

07:24.353 --> 07:28.223
Before I call the cops
on you for trespassing.

07:28.958 --> 07:31.860
Which is also
on my criminal record.

07:34.030 --> 07:37.098
- Ok. Mm-hmm.
Thank you very much.

07:37.133 --> 07:38.633
I really appreciate it.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.567
[hangs up cell phone]

07:39.601 --> 07:41.002
They're sending me
a replacement Nobel Prize.

07:41.036 --> 07:43.738
- I don't know why you
want it back so bad.

07:43.772 --> 07:44.839
As Wieb says,

07:44.873 --> 07:47.574
"clinging to past success
guarantees future failure."

07:47.609 --> 07:49.476
- Is that
a nighttime nugget?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.578
- No, it's
a daytime doodler.

07:51.613 --> 07:52.479
Very different.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.281
- How was your first day
of flying?

07:54.315 --> 07:56.316
- I didn't even get
in the plane.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.651
I failed the physical.

07:57.685 --> 08:01.121
They said I had too many branch
chain amino acids in my bloodstream.

08:01.155 --> 08:03.723
I have to take it again
tomorrow morning.

08:03.758 --> 08:05.492
I'm going to bed.

08:05.526 --> 08:08.663
- Be sure and lock
your bedroom window.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.935

Advertise your product or brand here

08:23.178 --> 08:25.312
You're not getting my TV.

08:25.347 --> 08:29.017
- You know, paranoia is
the opposite of power.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.284
No, it's not.

08:30.319 --> 08:31.285
All I'm saying is,

08:31.320 --> 08:34.789
You need to activate
your trust magnets.

08:35.191 --> 08:38.426
Just watch the DVDs.

08:45.368 --> 08:46.568
My TV!

08:46.603 --> 08:49.137
Oh, that is it.

08:49.171 --> 08:51.039
[knocking]

08:51.707 --> 08:53.107
Oh, good. The cops.

08:53.142 --> 08:55.342
Someone broke
into my house last night

08:55.377 --> 08:57.378
And stole
my cowboy boots.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.946
- What are you
talking about?

08:58.980 --> 08:59.847
Where's my TV?

08:59.881 --> 09:03.217
- Oh, now, you're saying
I stole your TV?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.585
You know you did.

09:04.619 --> 09:06.621
Oh, I get it.

09:06.655 --> 09:09.790
You stole my cowboy boots.

09:09.825 --> 09:10.925
What?

09:10.959 --> 09:14.295
- You stole from me 'cause
you think I stole from you.

09:14.329 --> 09:15.796
Arrest him, officers.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.631
He stole my boots.

09:17.665 --> 09:18.799
Tit for tat.

09:18.833 --> 09:21.669
Well, I never titted, so you
shouldn't have tatted.

09:21.703 --> 09:24.672
Arrest him, I tells ya!

09:24.906 --> 09:27.875
[static]
Dispatch, it's just a neighborhood dispute

09:27.909 --> 09:29.944
Between a rabbit
and a, uh...

09:29.978 --> 09:32.646
Sort of like
a hillbilly leprechaun.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.480
Over.

09:33.514 --> 09:35.916
[opening car door
and starting engine]

09:37.686 --> 09:39.920
- I'm gonna keep
my eye on you.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.289
- I'm a-gonna keep
my eye on you.

09:42.323 --> 09:46.393
- Good, because I'm
gonna keep my eye on you.

09:46.428 --> 09:47.228
Not good.

09:47.262 --> 09:49.430
'cause while
your eye's on me,

09:49.464 --> 09:51.966
My eyes are gonna be
on you.

09:52.000 --> 09:52.800
Well, great.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.036
Because while your eyes
are on me,

09:55.070 --> 09:56.204
And my eyes are on you,

09:56.238 --> 09:58.840
There's no way with both of
our eyes on each other's eyes

09:58.874 --> 10:01.943
That you can steal
any more of my stuff.

10:02.144 --> 10:05.614
- Wait. What?
- Just stay out of my house.

10:06.249 --> 10:07.115
All right, Daffy.

10:07.150 --> 10:09.184
You're clear
for final approach.

10:09.218 --> 10:10.018
Check.

10:10.053 --> 10:12.187
- Why'd you just open
the cargo doors?

10:12.221 --> 10:14.457
- Oh, is that
what that does?

10:15.258 --> 10:16.793
- Your nose is
too far down.

10:16.827 --> 10:18.094
Bring it up.

10:18.129 --> 10:19.930
The nose of the plane.

10:19.964 --> 10:21.766
Oh, right.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.602
- You're too far east.
Come west 5 degrees.

10:24.636 --> 10:25.970
Which way is west?

10:26.005 --> 10:28.139
Your left.

10:28.174 --> 10:30.075
Your other left.

10:30.109 --> 10:32.845
You're coming in too fast.
Reduce your air speed.

10:32.879 --> 10:34.246
What's my air speed?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.215
- It's on your
air speed indicator.

10:36.249 --> 10:37.516
Can you be more specific?

10:37.550 --> 10:39.118
- You're headed
for the trees.

10:39.152 --> 10:40.686
Pull up. Pull up.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.588
[crash]

10:43.790 --> 10:45.524
- Well, I think
that went pretty well.

10:45.559 --> 10:46.925
What do you say
we do it for real?

10:46.960 --> 10:49.195
- You've had 19 crashes
in a row.

10:49.229 --> 10:50.396
Simulated crashes.

10:50.431 --> 10:53.365
- Look, I'm gonna be
straight with you.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.602
I don't think
you're meant to fly.

11:05.211 --> 11:06.644
I guess sometimes,

11:06.679 --> 11:08.947
When you spread your wings,

11:08.981 --> 11:11.382
They get broken.

11:12.684 --> 11:13.551
Wait a second.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.820
Wieb says,
"the only thing separating

11:15.854 --> 11:20.325
"'I can't' from 'I can'
is a 't.'"

11:20.359 --> 11:21.592
And that little thing
before the "t"

11:21.627 --> 11:25.029
That looks like a comma,
but it's up instead of down.

11:25.064 --> 11:26.430
I can fly.

11:26.465 --> 11:27.865
I don't need a teacher.

11:27.899 --> 11:29.900
I don't need a license.

11:29.935 --> 11:33.070
I've got it all in here.

11:54.294 --> 11:56.195
Nope, not that one.

11:56.230 --> 11:57.530
Unh! Oops.

11:57.564 --> 11:59.398
What's this guy do?

11:59.433 --> 12:01.801
Hey! Hey! Aah!

12:04.972 --> 12:07.406
[crash]

12:08.842 --> 12:11.878
- Not bad for my
first flight, huh?

12:11.912 --> 12:14.914
[crickets chirping]

12:21.322 --> 12:23.422
- I don't know why
you're watching me.

12:23.457 --> 12:24.490
You're the thief.

12:24.524 --> 12:26.759
- You brought this
on yourself.

12:26.793 --> 12:28.527
You got trust issues.

12:28.561 --> 12:30.729
- Oh, I've got
trust issues, all right.

12:30.763 --> 12:34.466
Yeah. I trust you about
as far as I can throw you.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.802
Well, actually, I bet I
could throw you pretty far.

12:36.836 --> 12:41.773
So, let's just say I don't
trust you and leave it at that.

12:42.975 --> 12:44.376
[grunting]

12:44.410 --> 12:46.611
[glass cracking]

12:46.946 --> 12:48.614
The success pentagram.

12:48.648 --> 12:50.583
5 points of the pentagram

12:50.617 --> 12:51.884
Are visualization,

12:51.919 --> 12:53.419
Strategization,

12:53.453 --> 12:54.554
Realization,

12:54.588 --> 12:56.723
Execution, and diet.

12:56.757 --> 12:58.024
- What are you doing
in here?

12:58.059 --> 12:59.693
- The TV in the living room
was stolen

12:59.727 --> 13:01.294
And I need to watch
my DVDs.

13:01.329 --> 13:03.330
- Well, you don't need to be
under the covers.

13:03.364 --> 13:06.065
- Wieb says information
retention increases

13:06.099 --> 13:07.199
The more comfortable
you are.

13:07.234 --> 13:10.070
And right now, I need to
retain as much as possible.

13:10.104 --> 13:11.437
- Does anyone here
know anything

13:11.472 --> 13:13.840
About branch chain
amino acids?

13:13.874 --> 13:15.775
- I was expelled
from flight school.

13:15.810 --> 13:17.611
- Daffy, when are you
going to give up

13:17.645 --> 13:19.112
On all this nonsense?

13:19.147 --> 13:20.213
Never.

13:20.248 --> 13:21.415
Just like the title
of this DVD,

13:21.449 --> 13:24.217
"winners never quit
and quitters always quit."

13:24.251 --> 13:26.653
I am not giving up
on my dream.

13:26.687 --> 13:30.524
One way or another,
I will fly.

13:30.859 --> 13:34.161
- Congratulations,
flight attendants.

13:34.195 --> 13:37.464
You know there are
male flight attendants?

13:37.498 --> 13:40.601
- I like the height
that the heels give me.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.342
Please, pay close attention

13:50.343 --> 13:53.245
To the following important
safety information.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.146
To fasten your seatbelt,

13:54.181 --> 13:56.181
Place the flat metal end
into the buckle

13:56.216 --> 13:58.517
And tighten by pulling
on the strap.

13:58.552 --> 13:59.919
Your seatbelt
should be fastened

13:59.954 --> 14:02.221
Low and tight
across your hips.

14:02.255 --> 14:04.390
Unh!

14:20.474 --> 14:22.709
[baby crying]

14:24.145 --> 14:26.313
[kiss]

14:31.018 --> 14:32.953
[sizzling]

14:36.624 --> 14:38.392
[whack]

14:46.300 --> 14:49.269
[laughing]

14:49.304 --> 14:50.471
[ding]
- welcome to New Orleans,

14:50.505 --> 14:52.839
Where it's
a cool 65 degrees.

14:52.874 --> 14:55.042
We know you have
a choice when flying,

14:55.076 --> 14:56.944
And so, on behalf
of our flight crew,

14:56.978 --> 14:59.246
We'd like to thank you
for flying with us today,

14:59.280 --> 15:03.350
And hope to see you again
on your next journey.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.019
Oops. Don't forget
your coat.

15:06.054 --> 15:07.354
Hope you got a good rest.

15:07.388 --> 15:11.125
Ok, ladies. We're
in New Orleans.

15:11.159 --> 15:12.359
What do we do first?

15:12.394 --> 15:14.028
- What are you
talking about?

15:14.062 --> 15:15.229
What do you mean?

15:15.264 --> 15:16.364
Bourbon Street, girl.

15:16.398 --> 15:19.100
Let's ditch these heels
and have some fun.

15:19.134 --> 15:21.770
- Daffy, we have to fly
back to California.

15:21.805 --> 15:24.440
We have 20 minutes
to clean and prep the cabin

15:24.474 --> 15:25.341
For takeoff.

15:25.375 --> 15:26.909
- But it took 6 hours
to get here.

15:26.944 --> 15:29.112
It'll take another 6
to get back.

15:29.146 --> 15:30.079
That's the whole day.

15:30.114 --> 15:33.650
- That's the life
of a flight attendant.

15:33.685 --> 15:34.618
[keys clicking]

15:34.652 --> 15:36.754
[door opens and closes]
- where have you been?

15:36.788 --> 15:38.322
New Orleans.

15:38.356 --> 15:39.523
Are you wearing a skirt?

15:39.558 --> 15:41.892
- Yeah, but it's the heels
that'll kill you.

15:41.927 --> 15:42.893
I'm going to bed.

15:42.928 --> 15:45.229
We're supposed to fly
to Boston in the morning.

15:45.264 --> 15:47.965
Well, Phoenix,
then Boston.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.401
This girdle
doesn't help, either.

15:50.436 --> 15:52.237
[wriggling]

15:54.841 --> 15:57.743
[banging]

15:58.578 --> 16:01.347
Yosemite.

16:05.485 --> 16:08.186
He took my laptop?

16:10.989 --> 16:11.856
Yosemite.

16:11.890 --> 16:14.792
- What were you doing
in my house?

16:14.826 --> 16:16.394
I wasn't in your house,

16:16.428 --> 16:17.761
But you were in mine.

16:17.796 --> 16:19.630
What? No, I wasn't.

16:19.664 --> 16:21.932
I was sound asleep
when I heard a noise

16:21.967 --> 16:24.068
And saw my record player
was stolen.

16:24.102 --> 16:26.003
I went outside
to see what's what,

16:26.038 --> 16:29.173
And I see you
sneakin' around.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.541
This is ridiculous.

16:30.576 --> 16:32.243
Just give me my stuff back.

16:32.277 --> 16:34.812
- I told you
I ain't got your stuff.

16:34.846 --> 16:38.082
Now, stay
out of my house, rabbit.

16:39.818 --> 16:43.354
Oh, this means war.

16:43.389 --> 16:45.023
[glass breaking]

16:45.057 --> 16:47.392
[snoring]

16:48.026 --> 16:50.961
[snoring]

16:53.531 --> 16:56.466
[snoring]

17:08.645 --> 17:12.882
- You deserve to have
everything you've ever wanted.

17:12.915 --> 17:17.153
Just get up right now
and go take it.

17:17.186 --> 17:19.321
It's yours. It's all yours.

17:19.356 --> 17:21.790
All you have to do
is take it.

17:21.825 --> 17:25.594
Take what you want.
Take it! It's yours.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.229
Grr!

17:27.263 --> 17:30.332
[snoring]

17:30.367 --> 17:32.301
Aah! Ohh! Ooh!

17:33.937 --> 17:37.907
Boy, you wouldn't believe
the dream I had last night.

17:37.941 --> 17:40.442
You were trying to kill me.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.144
Well, I'm off to Phoenix.

17:42.179 --> 17:43.379
[luggage wheels rolling]

17:43.413 --> 17:45.347
- No, you're off
to our neighbors

17:45.381 --> 17:47.717
To return their stuff
you stole.

17:47.751 --> 17:49.085
[blink blink]

17:49.119 --> 17:51.287
- Huh. That's
another dream I had.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.689
It wasn't a dream.

17:52.723 --> 17:53.723
Those nighttime nuggets

17:53.757 --> 17:56.092
Helped you spread your
wings and fly, all right.

17:56.126 --> 17:57.626
Right into people's houses.

17:57.661 --> 18:01.730
- Wow. The Lunk mess is
more powerful than I thought.

18:01.764 --> 18:04.099
[doorbell rings]

18:08.971 --> 18:11.472
- Ecch. My replacement
Nobel Prize.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.341
- Huh. Now you've got
2 of 'em.

18:14.909 --> 18:16.710
Here you go.

18:18.313 --> 18:20.981
- Told you
I wasn't the thief.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.484
I owe you an apology.

18:24.252 --> 18:25.086
What's this?

18:25.120 --> 18:28.656
[gasps]
aww, you shouldn't have.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.725
- Sorry that it has
my name on it.

18:30.759 --> 18:32.126
- Nah, I got
an electric sander

18:32.161 --> 18:34.495
That'll take that
right off.

18:36.265 --> 18:37.732
What are we
doing here again?

18:37.766 --> 18:38.633
I don't know.

18:38.667 --> 18:41.135
Porky's invitation
said it was a surprise.

18:41.170 --> 18:41.970
Did I miss it?

18:42.004 --> 18:43.470
- I thought you
were going to Boston?

18:43.560 --> 18:45.760
Nah...
I've quit being a flight attendant.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.800
I mean, I wanna fly,

18:46.820 --> 18:48.241
but it's a lot of work.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.160
What?

18:52.200 --> 18:53.160
I like the heights.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.320
Uh... hello, everyone.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.160
Thank you all for coming.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.080
I've recently attended
a self-help seminar.

19:01.160 --> 19:05.160
which taught me, uh..., the importance of,
uh..., stepping outside of my comfort zone

19:05.200 --> 19:07.120
and, uh..., trying new things.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.760
It was about flying!
It's so sad.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.680
It's like he's incapable of getting it.

19:11.800 --> 19:15.760
So, tonight, uh..., I'm gonna do something
I've always wanted to do,

19:16.200 --> 19:18.600
but I've been, uh..., too scared to try.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.800
He is definitely not a Lunkhead.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.600
Uh-hoo!

20:08.640 --> 20:11.960
Now, THIS is the kind of flying
I was ment to do.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.080
I wish I've discovered this sooner.
What a thrill!

20:15.120 --> 20:17.560
Careful! You're going too high!

20:17.800 --> 20:19.120
Porky, you got to try it.

20:19.121 --> 20:21.520
This is what Wieb was talking about!

20:21.600 --> 20:24.480
Not that sad *** you were doing!

20:26.480 --> 20:28.320
Porky!
Hold the ***!

20:28.360 --> 20:29.880
Your airspeed is too low.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.880
Hold that ***!

20:31.000 --> 20:34.240
And push on the stick!
Push on that stick!

20:37.440 --> 20:38.760
Hm... Hm... Hm...

20:39.280 --> 20:41.120
