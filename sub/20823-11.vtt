WEBVTT

00:15.490 --> 00:18.448
- Ken's over.

00:18.490 --> 00:20.799
You could have woken him.

00:20.840 --> 00:24.014
can sleep through a hurricane.
Besides, you answered
on the first ring.

00:24.060 --> 00:26.108
- Are you done being impressed
with yourself yet?

00:26.150 --> 00:29.415
- Never.
Did Jules
get her acceptance letter]

00:29.460 --> 00:32.156
for her Italy trip?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.851
- Man, it must be killing her!

00:34.900 --> 00:36.856
- Yeah. She says it's like
Russian roulette every time

00:36.900 --> 00:39.334
she goes to the mailbox.
But that's not why I called you.

00:39.380 --> 00:42.031
- Oh. Let me guess. You were
thinking about the Ellis case.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.423
- I think he's innocent.
- He was caught on camera

00:44.470 --> 00:47.166
jacking cars from
the airport parking lot.

00:47.220 --> 00:50.519
- Yeah, but I've got a theory.
Two words: Twin. Brother.

00:50.570 --> 00:54.392
- Did you seriously just
pitch me the "evil twin" theory?

00:54.440 --> 00:56.396
- [It's not as crazy
as it sounds.]

00:56.440 --> 00:58.431
I tracked down an old friend
of his, and he had some

00:58.490 --> 01:00.481
very interesting things to say.

01:00.530 --> 01:03.533
But we are not staying up
'til four am again.

01:03.580 --> 01:05.889
Zoe can hold down the fort
for a couple hours.

01:10.590 --> 01:12.546
- Mhm!

01:12.590 --> 01:14.581
Can you hold, please?

01:19.600 --> 01:21.591
Sucker!

01:25.380 --> 01:27.382
Apologies, slight
technical glitch.

01:27.430 --> 01:29.739
Ahem. What time is the meeting?

01:29.780 --> 01:31.691
OK, they'll see you then.

01:31.740 --> 01:33.640
- Did you burn toast,

01:33.700 --> 01:35.998
or am I having a stroke?
- My rice cake got stuck.

01:36.050 --> 01:37.950
- You...

01:38.010 --> 01:40.649
put a rice cake in the toaster?
- Don't ask.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.611
I was up all night
staring at my phone.

01:46.620 --> 01:49.225
Who said Maz?
I was watching TV on it.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.236
Great new show
about crooked cops

01:51.280 --> 01:53.407
who are stupid and losers.

01:53.460 --> 01:55.587
- Hm.

01:57.630 --> 02:00.064
- It's 10:30 AM
and you left your glass

02:00.120 --> 02:01.929
by the case board.
- Oh!

02:01.990 --> 02:04.072
I was waiting up

02:04.120 --> 02:06.247
for Ken. He got here super late.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.109
- That's weird. He left
a couple of hours ago,

02:08.170 --> 02:10.126
looked fresh as a daisy.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.606
- I was right!
Joe Ellis had a twin brother!

02:13.650 --> 02:15.606
John Ellis,
born six minutes later.

02:15.650 --> 02:17.606
Here's his birth certificate.

02:17.650 --> 02:20.437
He tracked Joe down.
He used his key card

02:20.480 --> 02:23.608
to access the parking lot
after hours. I'm good.

02:23.660 --> 02:26.265
- You're alright-good.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.357
And why is he on a Post-it note

02:29.410 --> 02:31.617
with ﬁve exclaonﬁation marks?

02:31.670 --> 02:33.968
He's your new client.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.659
- And he needs PIs because...
- Um...

02:36.720 --> 02:40.156
He... Oh, where did I put it?

02:42.810 --> 02:45.631
Urgently needs to meet.
He's worried for his safety.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.946
- Someone wants to...

02:50.990 --> 02:52.981
kill him.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.816
Apparently he's
some kind of royalty.

02:55.870 --> 02:57.815
- Real royalty,
like William and Kate?

02:57.870 --> 03:00.304
Or pretend royalty,
like Beyonc and Jay

03:00.350 --> 03:04.434
- The first one.
- I know.

03:04.480 --> 03:08.007
It sounded weird at first,
but by the end I believed him.
You're meeting him in an hour.

03:08.050 --> 03:10.359
- You weren't here!

03:10.400 --> 03:12.834
Who was I to say no to a king?

03:12.880 --> 03:15.838
- OK._ Where are_ we
meeting this Luaen?

03:15.890 --> 03:18.666
- There's a gala today in
his honour. There's the address.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.712
- Shall I fetch
the royal carriage?

03:27.380 --> 03:29.678
- Ladies and Gentlemen,
rejoice in the arrival

03:29.730 --> 03:31.675
of the ruler of our fair land.

03:31.730 --> 03:34.290
The benevolent and gracious

03:34.340 --> 03:36.296
King Lucien!

03:59.100 --> 04:01.443
- We DEGCI a new assistant.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.970
- I see you and you see me

04:05.020 --> 04:09.366
Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're makin' a scene

04:09.420 --> 04:12.241
Oh boy, you've got to know

04:12.290 --> 04:14.724
What my head overlooks

04:14.770 --> 04:18.069
The senses will show
to my heart

04:18.120 --> 04:21.248
When it's watching for lies

04:21.300 --> 04:23.734
'Cause you can't escape my

04:23.780 --> 04:26.772
- Private Eyes
They're watching you

04:26.830 --> 04:30.049
Private Eyes

04:30.090 --> 04:32.263
They're watching you,
watching you, watching you

04:32.310 --> 04:34.562
Watching you

04:36.620 --> 04:39.578
- Lords and ladies,

04:39.620 --> 04:42.578
welcome to The Imperial
King's Court.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.757
Join me, as fierce warriors

04:44.800 --> 04:46.756
battle for their King's honour!

04:46.800 --> 04:48.756
My trusted Knight Sir Toby

04:48.810 --> 04:50.846
faces his first challenge.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.768
Let the games begin!

05:06.820 --> 05:09.345
- I've seen enough. Let's go.
- Yeah.

05:19.230 --> 05:21.130
- Remove him!

05:21.190 --> 05:23.579
How dare you
threaten your King's life!

05:23.620 --> 05:25.576
Take him to the dungeon.

05:25.620 --> 05:28.054
I... I... I shall
have your head!

05:34.980 --> 05:37.585
- That didn't look like

05:37.640 --> 05:39.767
that was part of the show.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.028
- Maybe something's rotten
in the state of Denmark.

05:49.210 --> 05:51.474
I'm Angie--
- Everett! Of course!

05:51.520 --> 05:53.988
And you! You must be
the esteemed warrior

05:54.040 --> 05:56.998
Matt Shade.
The internet tells me

05:57.050 --> 05:59.518
you were a famous hockey star.
I'm so happy you came.

05:59.570 --> 06:02.482
Treacher_ous ears
may be listening.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.839
For the purpose
of staving off suspicion,

06:04.880 --> 06:07.440
we should refer to each other
simply as friends

06:07.490 --> 06:09.446
until we are able
to speak in private. Hm?

06:09.490 --> 06:11.833
- S... sure.
- OK.

06:11.890 --> 06:13.187
- Squire! Your King
is entertaining

06:13.240 --> 06:15.367
friends. Bring us ale.

06:15.410 --> 06:17.844
- Uh... We don't
have any ale, Bob.

06:17.890 --> 06:21.417
I... thought
your name was Lucien.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.928
- I think there's some
peach iced tea in the fridge.

06:23.990 --> 06:26.857
- Curse your impudence!
If you value your job,

06:26.900 --> 06:29.118
you'll bring us ale!
- It's OK. We don't need ale.

06:29.170 --> 06:31.115
- Very well.

06:31.170 --> 06:33.161
Right this way, please.
Make haste.

06:40.180 --> 06:42.136
- So... that was
a pretty close call

06:42.180 --> 06:44.136
out there today.
- Sir Larry, the blue knight,

06:44.180 --> 06:46.136
does not like me
wearing this crown.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.872
- I have been in The Imperial
King's Court for two years,

06:51.930 --> 06:54.535
working my way up
from Squire to Knight to King,

06:54.580 --> 06:56.889
leapfrogging dozens
who have been around longer.

06:56.930 --> 06:58.886
They are jealous,
and they seek retribution.

06:58.940 --> 07:02.364
- Last week,

07:02.420 --> 07:04.888
while riding my horse to greet
the crowd, my saddle came apart.

07:04.940 --> 07:07.249
I fell. I nearly broke my neck.

07:07.290 --> 07:10.464
- Do you think Larry
was responsible for that too?

07:10.510 --> 07:12.466
- No. No, it's not just Larry.
There is a larger

07:12.510 --> 07:15.468
conspiracy afoot. People whisper
when I enter a room.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.250
Some insult me to my face.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.905
- Did you threaten their jobs
for not bringing you ale?

07:20.960 --> 07:22.916
- The Squire is supposed
to serve the king.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.781
I wear the crown. I earned it!

07:30.970 --> 07:32.926
Please.

07:32.970 --> 07:35.404
Someone in my kingdom
is out to get me.

07:35.450 --> 07:37.918
Sooner or later,
they will succeed.

07:37.970 --> 07:41.269
- OK. OK. We'll ask around.

07:41.330 --> 07:44.936
- Very good. Very good!

07:44.980 --> 07:46.936
Thank you! Come, come! Ah!

07:46.980 --> 07:48.982
Yes!
- OK. He's a hugger.

07:49.030 --> 07:51.191
Yeah.
- OK.

07:51.250 --> 07:54.947
: So, you really think
someone's really after him?

07:54.990 --> 07:57.038
- Well, I don't know.
He seems pretty caught up

07:57.080 --> 07:59.469
in the role of king.
- On the other hand, he's
clearly terrified of something.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.943
- There's Sir Larry
dialoguing that girl.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.956
- So, what
is a comely lady like you

08:04.000 --> 08:07.527
doing in a dreary dungeon
like this?

08:09.960 --> 08:11.951
- You tell me, milady.

08:12.010 --> 08:14.171
Care to see

08:14.230 --> 08:16.960
my longsword in action?

08:17.010 --> 08:19.092
- I've seen all the action
I need, thanks.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.448
- It must be a pretty sweet gig,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.309
being a knight
in a place like this.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.326
- The chicks love the armour.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.144
There's always
one or two who come,

08:27.200 --> 08:28.974
hang back with us
after the show.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.975
We call them
Ladies of the Knight.

08:31.030 --> 08:33.328
Knight spelled K-N-I-G--

08:33.380 --> 08:36.986
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, we get it.
Pretty dangerous though, no?

08:37.030 --> 08:38.986
Horses, swords...
deadly chandeliers.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.510
- We're friends of Bob's.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.646
Chad and I, we had that whole
fight worked out, and Bob,

08:48.700 --> 08:50.520
he came in at the last minute
and changed the choreography.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.781
- Chad was supposed
to parry, not duck.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.354
Look, I tried to apologize
to Bob backstage.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.868
He just yelled at me.
Called me a "saddle-goose."

09:01.930 --> 09:04.535
I don't even know
what that means!

09:04.580 --> 09:07.310
- Why would Bob think
that you were out to get him?

09:07.370 --> 09:09.588
Look, ever since he was given

09:09.630 --> 09:12.019
the king's crown two weeks ago,
he's gone off the deep end.

09:12.070 --> 09:16.029
Barking orders at people.
He's talking about his kingdom.

09:16.070 --> 09:19.813
It's starting
to piss everyone off.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.021
- No! Bob may have
become a dick,

09:22.080 --> 09:24.207
but back when we were
both knights,

09:24.250 --> 09:26.389
we were best buds.

09:26.430 --> 09:29.388
We have a code:
Knights not Fights.

09:29.430 --> 09:31.386
That's with "knights."
It's spelled K-N-I--

09:31.440 --> 09:33.567
- Yeah, yeah. Got it.
- Yeah, no. We understand.

09:33.610 --> 09:36.078
We heard that somebody tampered
with his saddle last week.

09:36.140 --> 09:40.611
- I don't know about that.
- Well, whose responsibility
is the gear?

09:40.660 --> 09:43.049
- That would be
the stable Squire. Aubrey.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.136
- The whole chandelier thing
was a total fluke.

09:45.190 --> 09:47.704
I watched Chad and Larry
practice before the show.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.058
- Well, what about
Bob's saddle? He fell

09:50.110 --> 09:52.055
during a show last week, right?
- Oh, yeah. That was hilarious.

09:52.110 --> 09:55.068
Landed on his ass.
Right in some horse crap, too.

09:55.110 --> 09:57.283
- So, what did
happen with the saddle?

09:57.330 --> 09:59.286
- Well, we get all our saddles
used from the rodeo,

09:59.330 --> 10:01.594
the police force, Kijiji,
I mean, wherever's cheapest.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.154
But you buy cheap,
you ride cheap.

10:04.210 --> 10:06.815
Like, um... Take a look
at this leather.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.816
It's worn through.

10:08.860 --> 10:10.999
Too much tension and it snaps.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.088
- You're saying that Bob
just had a lousy saddle?

10:13.130 --> 10:15.166
- Well, the knights need
the sturdy ones for battle.

10:15.220 --> 10:18.565
The King just does one ride
around the perimeter during
the opening number. So...

10:18.610 --> 10:20.658
- Of course.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.089
HR looked into it, determined
it was a total accident.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.449
But Bob didn't like that.

10:25.490 --> 10:27.526
So, he screamed
at the whole cast.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.798
I seriously think that guy has
some kind of mental illness.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.796
: Thanks.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.676
"Dissociative Identity Disorder.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.676
"Characterized by disparate
personality states,

10:45.810 --> 10:48.028
Sounds like what people
are saying about Bob.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.117
- I thought you believed him.
- I'm losing faith in the crown.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.126
- Yeah. We are seriously
wasting our time here.

10:53.170 --> 10:55.126
Let's get back to real life.

10:55.170 --> 10:56.956
- Yeah. Let's let him down easy.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.083
- Parry, Sir Toby! Parry!

11:00.130 --> 11:02.121
- If you let your guard down,
Sir Larry will strike

11:02.180 --> 11:04.136
with an empty fade.
- Ahem!

11:04.180 --> 11:07.911
- Friends_! What news
do you bring? Have you
uncovered the villain?

11:07.970 --> 11:10.131
- We... talked
to your colleagues,

11:10.190 --> 11:12.408
and looked into the saddle.
I'm sorry, Bob, but...

11:12.450 --> 11:15.317
- There's no evidence anyone's
trying to kill you. We think

11:15.370 --> 11:18.146
this might all be in your head.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.490
- Maybe you should take
some time off. You know, rest.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.110
This is the name of a friend
of mine who's a therapist.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.594
He might be able to help you.
Good luck, Bob.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.983
- I always knew
evil would wear a smile.

11:37.170 --> 11:40.958
- You want me
to abandon my throne.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.345
You are the true conspirators
behind these attacks!

11:44.390 --> 11:46.699
- Bob, calm down.

11:49.570 --> 11:53.188
Then come claim it!

11:53.230 --> 11:56.222
- Bob...

11:59.580 --> 12:02.367
Call an ambulance!

12:17.250 --> 12:19.206
Thanks for coming.
- No problem. I just cut my

12:19.260 --> 12:22.559
Krav Maga class a little short.
- Teach.

12:22.610 --> 12:25.215
- Of course.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.216
- He's stable. But he's going
to be out for a while.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.216
His system's in shock.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.738
-_ Are _se_izur_es common with
dissoaative identity disorder?

12:31.790 --> 12:34.964
- Um... Angie saw something

12:35.010 --> 12:37.831
on the internet.
- Do you have any idea
what's happening to him?

12:37.880 --> 12:39.836
- Not really. His respiratory
rate is all over the place,

12:39.880 --> 12:41.791
as is his temperature

12:41.840 --> 12:43.796
and his blood pressure.
It could be a drug overdose.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.841
- We won't know until the lab

12:45.890 --> 12:48.233
_ runs a tox_screen.
But in the meantime, I suggest

12:48.280 --> 12:51.238
you ask around, see if
anyone knows what he's on.
The sooner we identify it,

12:51.290 --> 12:53.190
the sooner I can
start treating him.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.195
- Thanks, Ken.
I'll see you later, OK?

13:00.820 --> 13:03.425
- Hey, Dad.

13:03.470 --> 13:05.426
- Hey, honey.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.778
- Oh, I'm just
researching what drugs

13:07.830 --> 13:09.775
induce mania.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.345
So, where's Mel tonight?
- She's still in court.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.391
But she asked if she could
take us for sushi again.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.613
- Cool.
- Speaking of cool,

13:18.660 --> 13:20.924
guess what I found

13:20.970 --> 13:23.837
when I got home tonight?

13:23.890 --> 13:26.836
- My acceptance letter
for the Italy trip?
- Congratulations!

13:26.890 --> 13:29.757
That must feel pretty amazing.
- Yeah... um,

13:29.800 --> 13:32.496
it's gonna be great.
I'm gonna go call Liam, OK?

13:32.550 --> 13:34.495
- Sure.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.987
- I hope your evening
is less confusing than mine.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.945
I just checked in with Ken.
There's no change

13:49.000 --> 13:50.900
in Bob's condition.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.565
both in relationships and still
spending our evenings alone?

13:53.610 --> 13:56.306
- We're dating workaholics.

13:56.350 --> 13:58.261
and I'm Googling
corticosteroids.

13:58.310 --> 14:00.130
Maybe we're the workaholics.

14:00.180 --> 14:02.307
- Listen, Bob's gonna be out
for a while. I say we go back

14:02.360 --> 14:04.351
to The Imperial King's Court
tomorrow and see if we can

14:04.400 --> 14:06.789
find out what drugs he's taking.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.149
- We may have to search
his house, too.

14:09.190 --> 14:11.317
Done for the day.

14:11.370 --> 14:16.103
Who says we're workaholics?
Well, uh...

14:16.150 --> 14:17.970
I should go to bed.

14:18.030 --> 14:20.897
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.336
Jules got accepted to Italy.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.814
- Oh, that's great, Shade!

14:27.860 --> 14:31.034
Except she's not that excited
about it, and I don't know why.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.036
- Huh. Well...

14:33.080 --> 14:35.640
teenagers are emotional
Rubik's cubes.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.510
Do you wanna talk about it?

14:38.570 --> 14:40.879
- Sure.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.876
[But we can't stay up
all night!]

14:42.920 --> 14:45.047
- Have you ever seen
Bob taking pills?

14:45.100 --> 14:47.443
Or something else?

14:47.490 --> 14:49.446
No way! He's straight edge.

14:49.490 --> 14:52.141
No drinking. No drugs.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.181
- I've offered him hits
more time than I can count.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.368
And I can count really high.
- Your parents must be so proud.

14:57.410 --> 15:00.015
Could
that have been tampered with?

15:00.070 --> 15:03.506
- Nah. Every cast member
gets the same catered meal

15:03.550 --> 15:06.371
before a show. If it was
the food, everyone'd be sick.

15:06.420 --> 15:09.378
I know everyone
said Bob is a jerk,

15:09.430 --> 15:11.557
but... no one here would
actually try to hurt him.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.068
We're a medieval family,
jerk or not.

15:18.350 --> 15:21.513
- Thanks.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.788
- I'll go high. You go low.
- Yeah, sounds good.

15:26.270 --> 15:28.830
Hey, uh... Did you
believe what she said?

15:28.880 --> 15:30.962
About the fact that no one

15:31.010 --> 15:32.966
really wanted to hurt Bob?
- Well...

15:33.010 --> 15:34.966
People around here don't

15:35.020 --> 15:37.363
seem particularly violent.
- Ha ha! Unless they're

15:37.410 --> 15:39.924
trying to kill each other
with broad swords and lances.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.585
- True...

15:42.630 --> 15:44.848
- Oh, wait. Angie, look.

15:44.900 --> 15:48.028
Is that Champagne?

15:50.470 --> 15:53.428
- Sparkling apple juice.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.597
Maybe Bob's as straight edge

15:55.650 --> 15:57.811
as they say he is.

16:00.130 --> 16:02.598
"May your show be glorious,
Your Highness."

16:02.650 --> 16:04.606
- A gift from
a secret admirer, maybe?

16:04.650 --> 16:06.527
- Someone close enough to him
to know he doesn't drink.

16:06.570 --> 16:08.822
- You think there was
something in the bubbly?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.438
- I don't know.
It's a bit of a stretch,

16:10.490 --> 16:12.481
but... there's
nothing else here.

16:12.530 --> 16:14.782
- I'll take the bottle
to the hospital, get it tested.

16:14.840 --> 16:18.094
- OK. I'll try to figure out
who came to see Bob

16:18.150 --> 16:20.095
bearing gifts.
- Alright.

16:22.450 --> 16:24.532
- Here you go, the Imperial
King's Court security footage.

16:24.590 --> 16:26.546
- I got a friend

16:26.590 --> 16:29.457
who's a LARPer. He knows a
mechanic, who knows a stunt guy,

16:29.510 --> 16:31.671
who knows the IT guy who works
at the Imperial King's Court.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.245
And this...

16:34.290 --> 16:36.895
is the day of the show.

16:36.950 --> 16:39.464
- There's Bob,

16:39.520 --> 16:42.819
arriving for work.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.474
Wait. Who's that?

16:47.520 --> 16:49.476
- Doesn't look
like she works there.

16:49.530 --> 16:52.340
- Is that a bottle
she's carrying?

16:55.530 --> 16:57.998
- Not anymore.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.496
- I think we just found
our Guinevere. Oh.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.407
Hey.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.405
Yeah, what's the address?

17:09.460 --> 17:11.451
I'll be right there.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.673
Shade just found Bob's house.

17:16.290 --> 17:18.246
- Good news

17:18.290 --> 17:20.155
or bad news?
- Bad news.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.201
- Well, the bad news
is Bob's still unconscious.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.162
No word yet on
the tox screen results.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.349
- The good news is they
fast-tracked testing the bottle.

17:27.390 --> 17:30.518
- Oh, we still
won't know for hours.

17:30.570 --> 17:34.131
...I thought that
was pretty good news!

17:47.580 --> 17:50.538
Huh. Bob's got a real flair

17:50.590 --> 17:53.548
for interior design.
- Let's spread out.

17:53.590 --> 17:55.546
Look for any signs
of this woman:

17:55.590 --> 17:58.764
jewelry, photos, hair ties.
- Alright.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.556
- This is a bachelor bathroom

18:05.600 --> 18:07.556
if I've ever seen one.
No lady stuff.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.556
No drugs.
- There's no one else

18:09.610 --> 18:12.556
in these photos, either.
If he knows this mystery maiden,

18:12.610 --> 18:14.601
he's not showing it.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.732
- Wow. Look at that.

18:18.790 --> 18:23.045
- Bob has some serious talent.
- Yeah.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.568
Hold on a sec.

18:25.620 --> 18:28.054
Protein powder...

18:28.100 --> 18:31.922
office supplies... a coffee mug.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.972
This is a boot box.

18:35.020 --> 18:37.193
- You know, a box for your stuff
when you get the boot.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.630
Bob got fired.
- "Effective immediately,

18:40.680 --> 18:43.592
Robert Sterling is terminated
from The Bright Star
Toy Company".

18:43.640 --> 18:45.767
This is dated two weeks ago.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.720
I didn't know
Bob had another job.

18:47.770 --> 18:49.590
- Well, maybe someone at his
old job can shed some light

18:49.650 --> 18:51.641
as to why he broke down
at his new one.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.605
- Janet Lonnegan, VP Strategy.
Please, come this way.

19:00.660 --> 19:02.605
- I've got to admit,

19:02.660 --> 19:05.436
I thought I'd see more toys
at a toy company.

19:05.490 --> 19:07.355
- Bright Star
may be a toy company,

19:07.400 --> 19:10.358
but we are a business
first and foremost.

19:12.450 --> 19:15.317
_ - Ye_s. We_are
private investigators.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.622
Bob is having a bit of trouble
at his other job.

19:17.670 --> 19:19.626
- We understand you guys
let him go two weeks ago?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.625
- I felt so bad for him.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.148
Bob worked in the mail room
for years. Nice guy.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.156
Kept to himself. But then he had

19:26.200 --> 19:29.203
a rather public breakdown
with our CEO, Wendel.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.946
- I don't know the details.

19:31.990 --> 19:35.642
I just know that Wendel
was pretty upset by it. Anyway,

19:35.690 --> 19:37.476
I'd love to chat, but I have
an important presentation

19:37.520 --> 19:40.296
to prepare for. We're
launching a new product.

19:40.350 --> 19:42.568
Any spoilers?

19:42.610 --> 19:45.659
- All I can say is that it's
a female action figure.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.827
I'm very proud of the work that
we're doing here at Bright Star:

19:47.880 --> 19:51.008
breaking barriers, empowering
young women everywhere.

19:51.050 --> 19:54.793
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.400
- Public breakdown.

19:57.450 --> 20:00.180
Sound familiar?
- And yet no sign of drugs,

20:00.240 --> 20:03.710
poisons, toxins...
Something doesn't add up.

20:05.940 --> 20:08.716
: Look!

20:08.770 --> 20:11.853
- It's the mystery woman.
What's she doing here?

20:11.900 --> 20:15.074
- I don't know, but it's about
time we introduced ourselves.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.029
- We were gonna
bring champagne,

20:23.090 --> 20:24.990
or would you prefer
sparkling apple juice?

20:25.040 --> 20:27.691
- I... I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

20:27.740 --> 20:29.696
- We're friends of Bob's.
- The ex-coworker

20:29.750 --> 20:32.093
you've been stalking.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.831
- Yeah, I... I knew backstage

20:35.880 --> 20:37.791
was for talent only.
Did Bob get my note?

20:42.280 --> 20:44.362
- Bob's in the hospital.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.231
He collapsed.
- Oh, my God!

20:47.280 --> 20:50.283
Wait a minute. You think
I had something to do with this?

20:50.330 --> 20:52.378
- When we saw you breaking in
to drop off the juice,

20:52.420 --> 20:54.376
we thought maybe
you laced it with something.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.729
- It was a gift!
It's one of our inside jokes.

20:56.770 --> 20:59.204
Once a week, Bob would

20:59.250 --> 21:01.070
bring a bottle of sparkling
apple juice to work and we'd

21:01.120 --> 21:03.293
pretend we were celebrating
some successful quest.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.900
- You guys are friends.
- Yes!

21:05.960 --> 21:07.905
Bob would always
leave funny sketches of me

21:07.960 --> 21:09.860
at my desk.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.729
I miss him.

21:11.790 --> 21:15.749
- We understand that Bob lost it
on the CEO here. Any idea

21:15.790 --> 21:18.395
why he would do that?
- Bob started acting paranoid.

21:18.450 --> 21:20.532
He was convinced that everyone
was out to get him.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.572
One day, Wendel caught him
at his desk going through
his computer,

21:23.630 --> 21:25.757
and Bob claims that Wendel
was spying on him.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.756
I mean, the whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

21:27.800 --> 21:32.419
Do you think that whatever made
Bob sick is what made him
paran0id, too?

21:32.460 --> 21:34.451
- We're not sure,
but it's a good theory.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.284
- I want to see him.
Can you take me?

21:36.330 --> 21:38.855
- Yeah.
- Sure.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.245
- I'll get my coat.
- I'm gonna stay behind,

21:42.300 --> 21:44.336
dig into Wendel a little deeper.

21:44.390 --> 21:48.736
- I don't know,
but... this is where
Bob's first outburst happened.

21:48.780 --> 21:52.602
- On with the bloodletting,
bring in the leeches!

21:52.650 --> 21:54.868
- Hey, Bob.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.912
How you feelin'?
- My loyal servant.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.303
Come. Come, come.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.056
...The nursemaids

22:03.100 --> 22:05.227
are out to get me. I suspect

22:05.280 --> 22:08.408
they might be spies.
- Bob.

22:08.450 --> 22:10.793
- Fey! My fair maiden.

22:10.850 --> 22:13.011
Oh, you have returned!

22:13.070 --> 22:16.324
And brought with you
an end to my madness.

22:16.370 --> 22:19.806
We must be as strong
as celestial night.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.067
Uh huh?

22:22.120 --> 22:24.338
- We will be.

22:24.380 --> 22:27.816
I'm not going anywhere.

22:27.860 --> 22:29.771
- It is so good to see you.

22:29.820 --> 22:33.165
- It's good to see you,
too, Bob.

22:33.220 --> 22:35.643
- Excuse me!

22:35.700 --> 22:37.656
Do you know
where the copier is? I'm...

22:37.700 --> 22:39.656
I'm super late to close this
file! I don't want to get canned

22:39.700 --> 22:41.656
by the boss.

22:41.700 --> 22:44.225
- I'm Angie. I... I'm new.
Ijust got hired in HR,

22:44.270 --> 22:47.444
and I... I have no idea
what I'm doing here.

22:47.490 --> 22:49.276
- I'm Wendel Silvie.
I own this place.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.276
- Oh, my God.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.185
That is very embarrassing.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.185
Please, just forget
everything I just said.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.016
- No, it's fine.
What are you working on?

22:58.070 --> 23:00.026
- I'm actually trying to close
an employee discharge file

23:00.070 --> 23:01.970
for a...

23:02.030 --> 23:03.986
Bob Sterling.
This dude totally yelled at--

23:04.030 --> 23:06.851
- Me.
- I did it again.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.027
Excuse me,

23:09.080 --> 23:12.038
I'm just going to go before
I put my foot in my mouth--

23:12.080 --> 23:15.345
I wouldn't want you to get
canned on your first day.

23:15.390 --> 23:17.950
Thank you! Um...

23:18.000 --> 23:21.436
I just need the final details
of what happened.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.870
- You know, Bob...
was a sweet guy,

23:24.920 --> 23:27.388
but he was becoming
an increasing disturbance

23:27.440 --> 23:29.396
in the workplace.
I came in here one day,

23:29.450 --> 23:32.408
I found him going through
my files. He accused me

23:32.450 --> 23:34.702
of some insane conspiracy.
I had to fire him.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.887
I mean, I had no choice.

23:36.930 --> 23:39.057
- That's tough.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.715
Well, I think
that's all I need, so...

23:41.760 --> 23:44.069
Thank you. You know,

23:44.110 --> 23:46.419
those are the first toys I've
actually seen in this place.

23:46.460 --> 23:49.634
- These Japanese tin robots.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.636
They're called kinzoku.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.635
After World War II,
my dad worked

23:53.690 --> 23:55.646
with Japanese manufacturers
to bring their toys

23:55.690 --> 23:57.863
to North America.

23:57.910 --> 23:59.866
These tin robots

23:59.910 --> 24:02.902
were the first toys
I ever played with.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.996
- That's an amazing legacy.
Thanks for your time,

24:05.050 --> 24:08.520
Mr. Sylvie.
- You're welcome, Angie.

24:10.570 --> 24:12.709
- [Hey. How did it go
with Wendel

24:12.750 --> 24:16.004
- Nice guy, but... it seems
like he's hiding something.

24:16.060 --> 24:18.221
- Did you get a look
at his computer?

24:18.280 --> 24:22.011
- No, but Zoe managed
to track down some of
the company's annual reports

24:22.060 --> 24:24.756
on the web. I'm just
checking it out now.

24:24.810 --> 24:28.109
]
- He's crazy, but awake.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.630
As soon as he saw Fey, he calmed
right down. It was sweet.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.636
[Let me know if you find
anything, OK

24:33.680 --> 24:35.557
- Will do.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.556
Matt, are you here?

24:37.600 --> 24:39.329
- Mel! Hey!

24:39.390 --> 24:41.517
What are you doing here?

24:41.560 --> 24:43.471
- Hi, Angie, I, um...

24:43.520 --> 24:45.954
Well, I got out of court
earlier than I expected,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.082
so thought I'd be spontaneous
and surprise Matt.

24:48.130 --> 24:51.349
- Oh! Well, he's at the hospital
with our client.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.483
- That's why you always
schedule spontaneity.

24:54.530 --> 24:57.966
So much for unwinding.

24:58.010 --> 25:01.571
Have you ever wanted
to throat

25:01.630 --> 25:04.849
- More times than I can count.

25:04.890 --> 25:07.848
- Bottle came back negative.

25:07.890 --> 25:09.972
No toxin of any kind.
- Well, that makes sense.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.975
The person who sent it
is being fed poetry by the king.

25:12.030 --> 25:13.986
What about his tox screen?

25:14.030 --> 25:15.986
- Bob's blood contains
high concentrations

25:16.030 --> 25:18.203
of Zolestis. It's an ADHD drug.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.981
- If you don't have ADHD, yes.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.122
Acute toxicity due
to methylphenidate overdose

25:24.170 --> 25:26.809
_ can result _
in delu5ions, anXIety,

25:26.870 --> 25:29.430
manic-like states.
- Well, Bob was acting like this

25:29.480 --> 25:31.436
two weeks ago when he got fired
from his other job.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.436
Would a dose last that long?
- No.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.436
He must have been ingesting
the drug over

25:35.490 --> 25:38.391
and over without knowing.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.000
- I was sitting in my car
in the alley

25:41.060 --> 25:43.620
and then, BAM!
He falls right on the hood!

25:43.670 --> 25:45.570
Idiot.

25:45.630 --> 25:47.530
- I didn't know your cases
could be so exotic.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.582
- Oh, yeah! As they say:

25:49.630 --> 25:52.144
variety is the spice of life.
- Mm.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.896
It sure sounds more interesting
than 10 hours in court.

25:54.940 --> 25:58.319
- Eh... We're two sides
of the same coin.

25:58.380 --> 26:00.075
I might catch the criminals,
but you're the one

26:00.120 --> 26:02.020
that puts them away for good.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.516
- Jules asked me what it's like
to be a lawyer.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.028
It was pretty cool
that she was so interested.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.901
She's really mature for her age.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.211
- More grown up than her dad.

26:12.260 --> 26:15.047
No.

26:15.090 --> 26:18.048
No, seriously. She's...
she's brave and smart.

26:18.090 --> 26:20.479
Shade just needs to stop
worrying so much.

26:20.530 --> 26:22.578
She's gonna be fine in Italy.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.626
- He didn't.

26:29.670 --> 26:32.798
- Oh, I... I'm sorry, I probably
shouldn't have said anything.

26:32.850 --> 26:35.580
- He's been like this
since the beginning.

26:37.590 --> 26:40.889
I have the feeling that he has
trouble opening up to people.

26:40.940 --> 26:43.067
Or is it just me?
- No!

26:43.120 --> 26:46.726
No, it's not just you. I mean...
Ken and I go through that
all the time.

26:46.770 --> 26:49.079
- Yeah! I mean, one minute

26:49.120 --> 26:52.032
he's telling me about his dream
to open a tea hut

26:52.080 --> 26:54.082
in the Hindu Kush and then
the next, he's got his head

26:54.130 --> 26:56.086
so wrapped up in a patient
that I can't even get him

26:56.130 --> 26:58.041
to pick a pizza topping.

26:58.090 --> 27:01.139
- Hell yeah.

27:04.140 --> 27:06.574
: Bob's asleep.

27:06.620 --> 27:09.919
- Hi. I'm Dr. Ken Graham.
- Fey.

27:09.970 --> 27:11.926
- Do you happen to know

27:11.970 --> 27:14.109
if Bob has
an attention deficit disorder?

27:14.150 --> 27:16.106
Was he taking
a drug called Zolestis?

27:16.150 --> 27:19.847
- Mm... no, I don't think so.
- Two weeks ago, when Bob got

27:19.890 --> 27:22.939
fired, had there been a change
in his routine or lifestyle?

27:22.980 --> 27:24.936
- Yes, actually. He started
going on a diet. He...

27:24.990 --> 27:27.242
wanted to be a more svelte king.

27:27.290 --> 27:29.246
- A protein powder.

27:29.290 --> 27:32.293
Um... Fortablast
Chocolate Cherry Craze.

27:33.470 --> 27:36.121
- Uh... Twice a day,
every single day.

27:36.170 --> 27:38.604
- That's it, that's
how it got in his system.

27:38.650 --> 27:40.606
Someone drugged that powder.
- Yeah.

27:40.650 --> 27:43.824
Bob was poisoning himself
and had no idea.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.836
WAKE UP!

27:55.890 --> 27:58.757
- Oh, my G...

27:58.800 --> 28:01.109
- Please tell me _
you had company last night.

28:01.150 --> 28:03.141
- Yeah.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.156
Mel stopped by.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.158
- That's where she was. Wait.
What did you guys talk about?

28:08.200 --> 28:10.156
- Later.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.293
Thank you. Coffee. Ooh.

28:13.340 --> 28:15.467
What did you find out?

28:15.510 --> 28:17.774
- Uh, well, the lab confirmed

28:17.820 --> 28:20.778
that Bob's protein powder was
laced with an elephant-sized

28:20.820 --> 28:22.776
dose of Zolestis.

28:22.830 --> 28:24.695
Like the ADHD drug?

28:24.740 --> 28:26.526
- Side effects for those without
ADHD include paranoia,

28:26.570 --> 28:30.358
disorientation, and believing
you're a 16th century monarch.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.709
It was in Bob's boot box,
which means he had it

28:32.750 --> 28:36.311
at Bright Star, too. What did
you find out about Wendel?

28:36.360 --> 28:39.705
- Oh, uh... The North American

28:39.760 --> 28:42.365
toy market is valued
at over $20 billion.

28:42.410 --> 28:45.277
Everyone's chasing
that one golden product

28:45.330 --> 28:48.493
because if you hit it, you can
be set for a very long time.

28:48.550 --> 28:50.848
- He released a series

28:50.900 --> 28:52.982
of shape-shifting cowboy toys.

28:53.030 --> 28:56.204
He made about $5 million,
but that was 10 years ago,

28:56.250 --> 28:58.206
and sales have _been
sagging ever smce.

28:58.250 --> 29:00.514
- Then how's he
keeping the lights on?
- That was my question, too.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.199
- Fey said Bob got fired
after Wendel caught him

29:03.260 --> 29:05.216
on his computer.
You think maybe he saw

29:05.260 --> 29:07.216
some financial information
he wasn't supposed to?

29:07.260 --> 29:09.216
Shady accounting,
stuff like that?

29:09.260 --> 29:11.000
- Maybe, but then
why the drugging?

29:11.050 --> 29:13.006
- To discredit Bob

29:13.050 --> 29:15.006
against any claims
of wrongful dismissal?

29:15.050 --> 29:17.746
- Yeah, I guess. Let's
take a closer look

29:17.790 --> 29:20.839
at this titan
of Bright Star. Ooh!

29:20.880 --> 29:23.883
After an aspirin.

29:28.940 --> 29:32.159
- I thought you said he was
going to the chiropractor at 11.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.589
- That's what Fey said.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.860
What's happening?

29:50.480 --> 29:53.256
- Wendel's just finishing up his
meeting with Janet. Stand by.

29:53.310 --> 29:56.302
- He's tied up with Janet.
- Well, she did say they were

29:56.350 --> 29:58.261
getting ready for a big product
launch. Maybe that has something

29:58.310 --> 30:00.312
to do with it.
- Well, if he doesn't

30:00.360 --> 30:02.999
leave soon, we're gonna miss our
chance to access his computer.

30:05.890 --> 30:07.926
- Ugh!

30:07.980 --> 30:09.925
Anything I should know?

30:09.980 --> 30:11.936
- Is it possible for two women
to spend time together

30:11.980 --> 30:13.936
and not talk about you, Shade?

30:13.980 --> 30:16.289
We discussed each other's cases,

30:16.330 --> 30:19.288
and how she became a lawyer.
My Dad. Jules going to Italy.

30:19.330 --> 30:22.288
The Kardashians...
- _You told her Jules
is gomg to Italy?

30:22.340 --> 30:25.503
- Ugh! I didn't mean to.
She was saying

30:25.560 --> 30:27.460
how wonderful it was to get to
know her and it just came out.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.465
I didn't know
you hadn't told her.

30:29.520 --> 30:33.342
- It's no wonder she hasn't
answered any of my texts.

30:33.390 --> 30:36.302
Did she seem upset?
- She wasn't thrilled.
I'm sorry.

30:36.350 --> 30:38.306
- Wait. There he is.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.531
- Alright, it's go time.

31:06.030 --> 31:09.295
- Um, Ijust missed a call
from our Quebec distributor...

31:16.700 --> 31:18.952
- OK, Wendel.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.343
What's your password?

31:21.400 --> 31:23.345
Mother's first name?

31:23.400 --> 31:27.359
No. Um...

31:27.400 --> 31:30.130
Name of your son?

31:32.280 --> 31:34.362
Hm.

31:34.410 --> 31:36.844
Wife's name?

31:38.980 --> 31:41.369
Dog?

31:41.420 --> 31:43.365
Crap.

31:43.420 --> 31:45.411
Um...

31:53.340 --> 31:55.296
Kinzoku.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.774
Yes!

32:04.180 --> 32:06.045
- Hey. I'm, uh,
I'm copying everything now.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.876
Oh, shoot!

32:07.920 --> 32:10.388
This is gonna take a while.

32:10.450 --> 32:13.874
is 20 minutes away.
You got lots of time.

32:13.930 --> 32:16.228
Uh oh.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.669
!
- He's back. Abort.

32:18.710 --> 32:21.144
! No, I can't!
It's still downloading.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.543
- Angie, get out of there! Now!

32:25.590 --> 32:28.024
Oh, come on!

32:28.070 --> 32:31.415
Come on!

32:31.470 --> 32:33.938
Yes!

32:36.120 --> 32:37.769
There's an urgent call
for you at reception.

32:37.820 --> 32:39.776
- I forgot my wallet.

32:39.820 --> 32:41.776
- Yes, but it's urgent!
I think it's your wife!

32:41.820 --> 32:44.129
- In a minute! Yeah, it's OK.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.957
Oh, dear. Ahem.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.174
Unbelievable, my memory!

32:50.220 --> 32:52.176
- Oh, yeah. Um...

32:52.230 --> 32:55.484
I... I think so, or...

32:59.020 --> 33:00.965
- Well, that was exhilarating.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.409
I've never been
part of a heist before!

33:03.450 --> 33:06.271
- Uh... For legal reasons,
let's not call it a heist.

33:06.330 --> 33:08.366
- These financial records
have a number

33:08.420 --> 33:10.411
of "off-the-book" accounts.

33:10.460 --> 33:12.280
- Well, let me see.

33:12.330 --> 33:14.286
There's a list of transfers

33:14.340 --> 33:16.467
from several numbered companies.
Ones I've never heard of,

33:16.510 --> 33:19.297
and not small amounts,
either. That can't

33:19.340 --> 33:21.205
be right. Wendel's pulling
money out of Bright Star?

33:21.260 --> 33:23.069
- He's using it as his own

33:23.130 --> 33:24.995
personal piggy bank. It's
the oldest trick in the book.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.996
- No. He's withdrawing it
as "salary"

33:27.040 --> 33:28.996
and then diverting all of it

33:29.050 --> 33:30.995
back into Bright Star
through the numbered companies.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.302
- He's using

33:33.350 --> 33:35.739
his own salary and bonuses
to keep the company afloat.

33:35.790 --> 33:38.008
- Seems like all the cash
is gomg into

33:38.050 --> 33:41.224
the development of a new toy:
Celeste E. L. Knight.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.180
There are designs here.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.845
- We gotta go see Bob.

33:48.890 --> 33:50.938
Zoe, send it all to me.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.800
- That's Celeste E. L. Knight!

33:56.860 --> 33:59.328
She's an intergalactic Knight
of the Star-Station Templar,

33:59.380 --> 34:02.110
which orbits the living
planet of Solomon.

34:02.170 --> 34:05.128
I swear I'm not still crazy.

34:05.170 --> 34:08.515
- This sketch was on Wendel's
computer. He's creating a
line of toys based off it.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.165
- But... that's mine!
I... I drew that!

34:11.220 --> 34:13.859
- We saw your sketches.
We knew that this could have

34:13.920 --> 34:16.047
only come from your imagination.

34:16.090 --> 34:18.229
- Is this because I yelled at
him? I couldn't control myself.

34:18.270 --> 34:21.046
And now they're
making my toy without me?

34:21.100 --> 34:23.523
_Janet said it wasn't
right for the company.

34:23.580 --> 34:26.048
- I showed her those sketches.

34:26.100 --> 34:28.887
Told her about my idea
for a play set based on Celeste

34:28.930 --> 34:30.579
E. L. Knight, but she said
knights were too old-fashioned.

34:30.630 --> 34:34.327
- Did you show your sketches
to anyone else?

34:34.370 --> 34:36.497
- Gosh, no! I... I don't
share my drawings with people.

34:36.550 --> 34:38.711
- Angie, look.
This is a royalty contract

34:38.770 --> 34:40.931
for the creation
of Celeste E. L. Knight.

34:40.990 --> 34:43.288
The designer gets 10 percent
of the gross profits. Look whose

34:43.340 --> 34:45.729
name is on the dotted line.
-Janet

34:45.770 --> 34:47.556
- She must be the one
who dosed the protein powder.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.387
- Making it easy
to discredit Bob if he ever

34:50.430 --> 34:53.081
tried to claim authorship
of Celeste E. L. Knight.

34:53.130 --> 34:55.303
- She's pitching to

34:55.350 --> 34:57.910
the distributors to sell
the toy. If this goes through...

34:57.960 --> 35:00.611
- It'll be like Bob's work
never eXIsted.

35:04.710 --> 35:06.575
- 10 minutes to show time.
How are you feeling?

35:06.620 --> 35:08.576
- Primed and ready, boss. This
has been a long time coming.

35:08.620 --> 35:11.362
- Great idea.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.310
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:13.370 --> 35:16.749
may I present:
Celeste E. L. Knight,

35:16.810 --> 35:19.586
an intergalactic heroine
for the modern age.

35:19.630 --> 35:21.586
Now, market research
suggests an uptick

35:21.640 --> 35:23.585
of science fiction figures
in girls ages

35:23.640 --> 35:25.596
6 to 13--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.551
But why does she have a hammer?

35:30.600 --> 35:31.589
- Well, don't knights
carry swords?

35:31.650 --> 35:33.902
- It's not a hammer.

35:33.950 --> 35:35.941
It's a maul.

35:38.830 --> 35:41.390
- They're not HR.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.614
I was in the hospital
and they saved my life.

35:44.660 --> 35:47.174
- I almost died,

35:47.230 --> 35:49.095
but I'm better now. Thanks.

35:49.140 --> 35:51.927
- That's great news.
Wendel? The presentation.

35:51.970 --> 35:55.406
- Yeah. Of course.

35:55.450 --> 35:57.623
I... I... I'm sorry Bob,
you're gonna have to leave.

35:57.670 --> 36:00.195
- You might want
to hear this first.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.879
- We're private investigators.

36:02.940 --> 36:05.067
Bob hired us because he thought
someone was trying to kill him.

36:05.110 --> 36:07.670
- That's ridiculous.
- At first, Bob did sound crazy.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.984
But then, that's exactly
how you wanted him to appear,

36:11.030 --> 36:13.635
right Janet?

36:13.690 --> 36:16.648
- You didn't create
Celeste E. L. Knight. Bob did.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.472
Bob isn't well, Wendel.
You remember

36:22.520 --> 36:23.999
how he blew up at you
in your office?

36:24.050 --> 36:26.655
- The doctors found a large dose
of Zolestis in his system.

36:26.700 --> 36:28.827
It's a drug used for ADHD.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.259
- Only Bob doesn't have ADHD.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.096
Anyone took what he was given,
they'd act a little loco, too.

36:35.140 --> 36:38.223
- Janet, doesn't
your nephew have ADHD?

36:38.280 --> 36:40.794
- Wendel! You can't possibly
believe any of this.

36:40.850 --> 36:43.489
- You drugged Bob,
and you waited for his behaviour

36:43.540 --> 36:45.679
to get him fired.
- This is a joke!

36:45.720 --> 36:48.848
- How long did you wait
to pitch the toy

36:48.900 --> 36:51.323
A week?
- The same day.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.462
- When was the last time
you had a home run pitch, Janet?

36:53.510 --> 36:56.729
- You hear rumours about
the company being on thin ice.

36:56.770 --> 36:59.466
That there may be cut backs.
You desperately need a win

36:59.520 --> 37:01.681
to hang onto your job.
- And then you come across

37:01.740 --> 37:03.685
a sketch of genuine inspiration

37:03.740 --> 37:06.208
and you just can't resist.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.524
- You can't prove any of this.

37:08.570 --> 37:10.913
If you are the creator,
then you would have a sketch

37:10.960 --> 37:13.690
of the original drawing, no?
- Of course.

37:13.750 --> 37:16.218
Here!

37:16.270 --> 37:18.352
Signed with my name and dated.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.537
- Bob, could I see

37:20.580 --> 37:23.572
your sketch book?

37:37.080 --> 37:39.947
- Bob, this looks
like a sketch of Fey!

37:42.430 --> 37:45.251
- She works here.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.211
- Why would you create
a character based

37:47.260 --> 37:50.343
on one of Bob's best friends?

37:52.740 --> 37:55.049
- Not so creative now,
huh, Janet?

37:59.880 --> 38:02.223
- Wendel...
- Leave.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.792
Just leave. You're fired.

38:19.810 --> 38:21.812
I don't know what to say, Bob.

38:24.820 --> 38:26.720
- Oh, gosh!
The distributors. Oh...

38:26.780 --> 38:28.736
What the hell am I gonna do?
I gotta--

38:28.780 --> 38:30.554
- Um, if I may
offer a suggestion?

38:30.610 --> 38:33.340
Why don't you give Bob a shot?

38:40.570 --> 38:43.698
- No, thank you.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.310
- Not the response
I was expecting. Just,
uh, give us two minutes.

38:52.020 --> 38:53.976
This is your chance!

38:54.020 --> 38:56.807
Have my idea
shot down again?

38:56.850 --> 38:59.159
- It's not gonna get shot down.
Wendel loves it.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.634
- Yeah, when Janet pitched it!
I'm a 31-year-old

39:01.680 --> 39:03.762
former mail room clerk
who draws cartoons

39:03.810 --> 39:05.892
in his spare time. I'm a nobody.

39:05.950 --> 39:07.986
- Bob. You're a king.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.645
- That was just a costume.
- Not true. Being a king

39:10.690 --> 39:12.817
has nothing to do
with what you wear.

39:12.870 --> 39:15.122
- That toy in there
came from your imagination.

39:15.170 --> 39:17.172
Turning imagination
into reality,

39:17.220 --> 39:20.474
that's the power of kings.

39:20.530 --> 39:22.828
- That was a nice thing to say.

39:22.880 --> 39:25.303
- Now, get in there!
You don't need a crown.

39:25.360 --> 39:28.614
- Because it's been inside me
the whole time?

39:28.670 --> 39:31.355
- No. We just don't have it. We
left it at Imperial Kings Court.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.662
Now get in there!

39:33.710 --> 39:37.498
- Come on!
- Come on, big man!

39:37.540 --> 39:40.008
- Why does she have,
um, a hammer?

39:40.070 --> 39:43.585
- It's a maul.

39:46.070 --> 39:48.686
It has the density
of a dwarf star,

39:48.730 --> 39:52.029
designed to destroy planets
with a single strike.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.513
But, the Knight
only uses it for good.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.381
So, that's neat.

39:59.910 --> 40:02.697
Ladies and gentlemen,
I apologize for my late arrival.

40:02.740 --> 40:05.174
My name is Bob Sterling,

40:05.220 --> 40:07.040
and I would like to regale you

40:07.100 --> 40:08.874
with the tale
of Celeste E. L. Knight,

40:08.920 --> 40:11.571
the last crusader of the cosmos.

40:25.070 --> 40:27.026
- Sold to 30 countries

40:27.070 --> 40:29.026
worldwide and counting.
- Mmhmm!

40:29.070 --> 40:31.812
- Bright Star has never
had an order this big

40:31.860 --> 40:35.375
on any product, ever.
And Bob is the official

40:35.430 --> 40:37.898
designer on the entire
Celeste E. L. Knight series.

40:37.950 --> 40:40.259
- Congratulations, Bob.

40:40.300 --> 40:42.905
- To think, it all started
with a hostile drugging.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.258
I should've almost died sooner.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.084
- Speaking of which,

40:47.140 --> 40:50.268
what's going on at
the Imperial King's Court?

40:50.310 --> 40:53.222
- I decided to give up my throne
to make way for King Larry.

40:53.270 --> 40:55.875
He deserves it, and, uh...

40:55.930 --> 40:58.091
I'm just more comfortable
being me.

40:58.150 --> 41:00.050
- Yeah.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.580
- Ah, come here!

41:02.630 --> 41:04.882
- OK! Yeah, yeah!

41:04.940 --> 41:06.749
OK, big fella!
Yeah, there it is!

41:09.160 --> 41:11.936
- Hey...

41:11.990 --> 41:15.767
- Oh, hey!
I've been calling you.

41:15.820 --> 41:19.938
- Busy day.
- Right. Um... Listen,
about Jules going to Italy.

41:19.990 --> 41:21.946
- It's fine, Matt.
- No.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.082
No, it's not.
Look, I wasn't hiding it.

41:24.130 --> 41:26.030
I was just trying
to wrap my head around it,

41:26.090 --> 41:28.479
and... I'm used
to doing that alone.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.136
- Well...

41:31.180 --> 41:34.911
maybe it's time you remember
you're not alone anymore.

41:34.970 --> 41:38.098
- ...I know.

41:38.140 --> 41:40.449
I'll work on that.

41:40.490 --> 41:42.310
I promise.

41:42.360 --> 41:45.978
- What if we could

41:46.020 --> 41:49.626
Would we get to choose
What if we fade

41:49.680 --> 41:54.322
All we've got to lose
What if we run

41:54.380 --> 41:56.985
What if we run

41:57.030 --> 41:58.986
- In here.

41:59.030 --> 42:00.986
- Oh.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.985
Hey, honey...

42:03.040 --> 42:06.339
can I talk to you about Italy?

42:06.390 --> 42:08.824
- Are you gonna
talk me into going?

42:08.870 --> 42:10.826
- Not if you don't want to.
Ijust... Iwanna know

42:10.870 --> 42:13.475
what happened.

42:13.530 --> 42:15.339
It's not important.
Let's get a pizza,

42:15.400 --> 42:17.743
watch Eat Pray Love.
It's basically the same thing.

42:17.790 --> 42:20.315
- No. It's not, honey.
It's not the same thing at all.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.999
You were gonna dip your toes

42:23.060 --> 42:26.621
in the Trevi fountain with Ruby
and Ariel. What changed?

42:26.670 --> 42:30.015
- They backed out...
I'm the only one

42:30.060 --> 42:32.016
in my class going.

42:32.070 --> 42:35.676
I've never done
anything like this before.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.769
What if I can't do it?

42:38.810 --> 42:40.675
For 15 years,

42:40.730 --> 42:43.028
I've watched you lay waste
to every challenge

42:43.080 --> 42:45.116
that comes your way.
- Dad...

42:45.170 --> 42:47.161
- Honey, life will
always throw things at you

42:47.210 --> 42:49.383
that you've never dealt with
before. And if you're always

42:49.430 --> 42:52.035
focused on failure,
you'll never have the chance

42:52.090 --> 42:54.035
to know what_success
can feel like.

42:54.090 --> 42:56.604
- Thanks, Dad.

42:56.660 --> 42:58.469
Where'd you get that one from?

42:58.530 --> 43:00.566
- Mutual fund commercial.
- Nice.

43:03.620 --> 43:06.054
I love you.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.874
- Yeah. I love you too, honey.

43:07.930 --> 43:11.058
- I want to be closer

43:11.110 --> 43:15.069
I want to feel closer

43:15.110 --> 43:18.068
Closer to you

43:20.460 --> 43:23.372
O-o-o-oh
O-o-oh

43:23.420 --> 43:25.411
O-o-o-oh

43:25.470 --> 43:27.426
O-o-o-oh

43:27.470 --> 43:29.722
O-o-o-oh

43:38.870 --> 43:40.826
We get to choose

43:40.870 --> 43:43.828
What if we fade
all we 've got to lose

43:43.880 --> 43:46.223
What if we could

43:46.270 --> 43:48.261
We get to choose

43:48.320 --> 43:52.097
What if we fade
all we've got to lose

43:52.150 --> 43:56.109
What if we run
What if we run

43:56.150 --> 43:59.108
What if we run
