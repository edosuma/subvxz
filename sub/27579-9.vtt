But my viewers
prefer the truth.

04:17.660 --> 04:22.660
And the truth, in my opinion,
is that these goofy glasses

04:23.332 --> 04:27.503
are just another way for kids
to disengage from the world,

04:27.570 --> 04:31.073

disappoint their parents,

04:31.140 --> 04:35.978

G. Gordon, I'm proud
of our product.

Was it Mantis?

Was it Ma'alefa'ak?

what the life is like.

14:39.348 --> 14:40.883
I am impressed.

14:40.950 --> 14:42.618
Look at all
you've accomplished.

14:42.685 --> 14:44.887
You discovered where
the parents and children

14:44.954 --> 14:46.623
came to gather
for their play date.

14:46.690 --> 14:49.558
You leased the house
across the street,
set up wire taps,

14:49.625 --> 14:51.894
cameras, microphones,
infra-red...

14:51.961 --> 14:55.230
You've truly mastered
the surface world.

14:55.297 --> 14:57.533
These are useful skills.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.903
Worthy of the Shadows.
Not to be wasted.

15:00.970 --> 15:04.507
(IN ENGLISH)
I'm glad you approve,
Lady Shiva.

15:04.574 --> 15:09.574
Now watch as I step outside
and with one blast
from Neptune's trident,

15:11.147 --> 15:14.784
deal a blow from which
the so-called heroes

15:14.850 --> 15:16.986
will never recover.

15:17.053 --> 15:20.790
Yes, you could do that.
It has been contemplated.

15:20.856 --> 15:23.425
As you know, it's what
the Light refers to as their

15:23.492 --> 15:25.661
BOTH: Nuclear option.

15:25.728 --> 15:27.631
But the thing
about going nuclear,

15:27.697 --> 15:31.167
is that one must be
prepared for mutually
assured destruction.

15:31.234 --> 15:35.604
So the Light has
vowed never to use
this option lightly.

15:35.671 --> 15:40.671
Please. I am Orm,
the Ocean-Master.

(SCOFFS) Prince...
I should be King!

15:46.616 --> 15:51.616
Instead I spent six years
inside an Atlantean prison!

15:51.687 --> 15:54.056
Six years!

15:54.123 --> 15:57.893
I will not be denied
my revenge.

Forager now understands

to save Forager.

never know.

QUEEN BEE:
Excellent work, Lady Shiva.

19:44.154 --> 19:48.190
You were clearly
the right choice to become
the Light's new enforcer.

19:48.257 --> 19:50.160
As to the other
item of business,

19:50.227 --> 19:54.997
Lobo may not know he failed,
but killing Forager
was never the point.

19:55.064 --> 19:57.933
We can now confirm
Vertigo's testimony.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.169
That the Superboy
and Black Lightning

20:00.236 --> 20:02.905
participated in
the Markovian incident.

20:02.972 --> 20:04.474
ULTRA-HUMANITE:
<i>Such a waste.</i>

20:04.541 --> 20:07.243
<i>We lost an excellent source
</i> <i>of meta-humans.</i>

20:07.310 --> 20:10.080
There are other options
on that front.

20:10.147 --> 20:14.684
But after Markovia,
and after the communique
from Ra's al Ghul,

20:14.751 --> 20:18.155
the Light required
confirmation of
all we suspected.

20:18.222 --> 20:22.826
Now, we can be certain
that Grayson has assembled
a new off-the-books team,

20:22.893 --> 20:27.893
consisting of the Superboy,
Lightning, Sportsmaster's
younger daughter,

20:28.398 --> 20:30.433
the banished Prince
of Markovia,

20:30.500 --> 20:35.071
the New Genesian Bug
and an unknown meta-girl.

20:35.137 --> 20:38.307
Seven champions.
An elegant number.

20:38.374 --> 20:40.709
And we've learned
to our regret

20:40.776 --> 20:42.345
that young heroes like these

20:42.412 --> 20:46.682
can cause the seven of us
no end of trouble.

20:46.749 --> 20:49.551
No worries, my friends.

20:49.618 --> 20:51.521
A plan is in place.

20:51.588 --> 20:54.990
We'll deal with
these naughty children
