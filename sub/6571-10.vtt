00:01.968 --> 00:05.369
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.471 --> 00:07.463
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:09.565
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.081 --> 00:16.742
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.580
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael Bluth arrived home</i>
<i>to find his mother, Lucille...</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:25.852
- <i>in a state of agitation.</i>
- I think the company's in trouble.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.325
What tipped you?
The falling profits...

00:28.428 --> 00:31.488
or that we're a regular feature on Bill O'Reilly's
"Most Ridiculous Item of the Day"?

00:31.598 --> 00:36.160
I'm talking about the fact that my "friend"
Lucille Austero bought our company...

00:36.269 --> 00:39.568
and I think she's going for
a power grab, that <i>bitch!</i>

00:39.672 --> 00:42.106
You're not at home, Mom.
She doesn't live next door when you're here.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.507
Secondly, she's already grabbed power.
She's the majority shareholder of the company.

00:45.612 --> 00:49.013
I'll tell you what she wants
to grab: Your brother Gob.

00:49.115 --> 00:52.414
- <i>[Narrator] In fact, Lucille 2</i>
<i>was already with Gob-</i>
- You look really nice.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.352
- <i>but she was growing tired ofhis neediness.</i>
- Where are you going?

00:55.455 --> 00:57.355
I'm going to my spin class.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.357
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- Thought you had vertigo.

00:59.459 --> 01:02.553
<i>She'll sell the company or break it up</i>
<i>into little parts or something...</i>

01:02.662 --> 01:05.927
all under the guise of
"caring" about our family.

01:06.032 --> 01:10.025
Gotta stop quoting when you drink.
I certainly hope she's not planning a move.

01:10.136 --> 01:14.402
I wouldn't put it past her.
She'd love to get at me any way she could.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.407
That's why she's been
flirting with Gob.

01:16.509 --> 01:20.104
She's trying to prove that she's closer
to my children than I am...

01:20.213 --> 01:23.705
but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know
how little I care for Gob.

01:23.817 --> 01:27.048
- Think that makes the joke on Gob.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

01:27.153 --> 01:29.087
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Hey, buddy.</i>

01:29.189 --> 01:31.089
Was that Gangy who was just-

01:31.191 --> 01:34.991
You all right? Sorry.
Your grandmother had a little accident here.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.825
Oh. Does that mean she's gonna
have to come live with us?

01:37.931 --> 01:41.799
No, no. No. It was- It was her drink,
and even if it wasn't, just-

01:41.901 --> 01:44.870
Do you remember when I bid on Sally Sitwell
at the bachelorette auction?

01:44.971 --> 01:48.600
They sent me this basket with all this stuff
for our date, you know. It's a whole package.

01:48.708 --> 01:51.677
I thought that maybe we could do it
together, like a Valentine's present.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.008
- You're not gonna take Sally?
- Sally, no. No.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.514
L-I wanted it for us.
I never wanted to be with Sally.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.585
<i>[Narrator] Actually, Michael</i>
<i>had gone over to Sitwell Enterprises</i>- 

01:59.686 --> 02:03.850
- Michael Bluth to see Sally.
- <i>one day earlier to set up a date with Sally.</i>

02:03.957 --> 02:08.291
I'm afraid she's not here. If you'd like me
to take the package, I can give it to her.

02:10.096 --> 02:13.623
No, no. This is, uh-
This is not for her. It's for my son.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.099
Just don't tell her I came by.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.466
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, Sally wasn't there...</i>

02:18.571 --> 02:20.869
<i>and the person Michael saw</i>
<i>was her father.</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:24.535
- You kidding? This makes me
look like my daughter.
- <i>No one's going to think that.</i>

02:24.644 --> 02:27.579
I look like Edgar Winter.
Forget it. I gotta get to spin class.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.013
<i>So what do you say?</i>
<i>We got a basketful of father-son fun here.</i>

02:31.117 --> 02:34.780
- What's Kama Sutra oil?
- [Clicks Tongue] Maybe it's not for us.

02:34.888 --> 02:38.119
<i>Ah, Valentine's Day, which</i>- 

02:38.224 --> 02:40.192
Oh! Was your mother here?

02:40.293 --> 02:42.989
Here. You all right?
I'll help you up.

02:43.096 --> 02:46.190
Oh, that is quite a basket
you've got there, Michael.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.392
That Sally Sitwell
is one lucky lady.

02:48.501 --> 02:52.232
Well, I'm- I'm not so sure that she's actually...
right for me, anyway.

02:52.338 --> 02:56.138
But you got one of these too, didn't you?
Y-You bought Lindsay at the same auction.

02:56.242 --> 02:59.734
Well, yes, but I'm afraid
I prematurely shot my wad...

02:59.846 --> 03:01.973
on what was supposed to be
a dry run, if you will.

03:02.081 --> 03:05.141
So now I'm afraid I have
something of a mess on my hands.

03:05.251 --> 03:08.152
It's just-There's so many
poorly chosen words in that sentence.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.917
<i>[Narrator] Tobias wanted to make sure</i>
<i>that everything was perfect for Lindsay...</i>

03:12.025 --> 03:15.153
<i>so he went to check it out first.</i>

03:15.261 --> 03:17.661
Oh. Body chocolate.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.595
[Moans]

03:19.699 --> 03:24.033
- It's a wonderful package. I'll take it.
- You just did.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.867
<i>Why don't you take this?</i>
<i>I don't have anyone to go with anyway.</i>

03:26.973 --> 03:29.441
[Chuckles] Can you imagine
how jealous that would make her?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.476
[Screeching]
"Where's Tobias?"

03:31.578 --> 03:35.139
[Normal Voice] "Oh, he's just sharing
a romantic horseback ride with Michael Bluth...

03:35.248 --> 03:37.409
and they're dipping each other in"-

03:37.517 --> 03:41.419
- Oh, you didn't get any body chocolate.
- L-I didn't mean with me.

03:41.521 --> 03:45.355
L-I hate to see you struggle like this.
In fact, why don't you let me ask her for you?

03:45.458 --> 03:49.019
Well, Michael, you really are
quite the Cupid, aren't you?

03:49.128 --> 03:53.087
I tell you, you can zing your
arrow into my buttocks anytime.

03:53.199 --> 03:56.965
Okay. You know what you do? Buy yourself a
tape recorder. Record yourself for a whole day.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.800
I think you're gonna be surprised
at some of your phrasing.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.807
[Gasps]
Butterscotch! Want a lick?

04:02.909 --> 04:06.345
<i>[Narrator] And later, Lindsay</i>
<i>stopped by the office at Michael's request.</i>

04:06.446 --> 04:10.974
Great. Thank you. Listen. I want you to take...
my romance package at the Four Seas Hotel.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.644
- Oh, yea!
- That's great. Tobias is gonna be thrilled.

04:13.753 --> 04:17.382
- Oh. I have to go with Tobias?
- Lindsay, your husband really wants this to work.

04:17.490 --> 04:20.947
- Come on. Let me play Cupid this year.
- I thought he went already.

04:21.060 --> 04:25.497
- I'm giving you mine.
- Because you're afraid to ask
Sally Sitwell to go with you.

04:25.598 --> 04:29.056
- That's not true at all.
- Mmm? [Imitates Bird]
Chaw-chee-chaw, chee-chaw.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.432
- What is that? Is that a chicken?
- What's this?

04:31.537 --> 04:33.971
- Oh. Michael's scared to ask out Sally.
- No, I'm not.

04:34.073 --> 04:37.804
- Chaw-chee-chaw-
- This is priceless. [Clucking]

04:37.910 --> 04:41.402
You too. This is great. Come on.
These aren't even birds.

04:41.514 --> 04:44.074
- I am not-That's enough.
There are people working.
- [Both Stop]

04:44.183 --> 04:46.845
Listen, I think that Lucille 2
is up to something.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.684
Mom said the same thing. I thought she was
ticked off'cause you're seeing her.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.315
What? You're seeing Lucille 2?
Does Buster know?

04:53.426 --> 04:57.157
No. And I'm not.
Just don't tell people-

04:57.263 --> 05:01.029
I'm playing the part of the gigolo
so that she'll keep the company afloat.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.763
But something weird happened yesterday
when I was trying to find a way out of there.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.802
[Phone Rings]

05:08.908 --> 05:10.808
Hello?

05:10.910 --> 05:14.812
- [Dial Tone]
- <i>[Narrator] In fact, it was Stan Sitwell calling her...</i>

05:14.914 --> 05:17.781
<i>as he'd become quite taken</i>
<i>with Lucille 2 himself.</i>

05:17.884 --> 05:20.614
It all makes sense.
Why else would Sally Sitwell be avoiding me?

05:20.720 --> 05:24.622
- She thinks you're a loser.
- And why would Lucille 2
be so distant toward me?

05:24.724 --> 05:27.386
- 'Cause she knows you're a loser.
- I think it's pretty clear.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.893
Lucille 2 and Sitwell
are working on a business deal.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.931
Lindsay, I'd like for you to go over
to Sitwell and see what you can find out.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.159
- I can't go there again.
- Why do I have to do that?

05:35.268 --> 05:37.862
Because you've been helping yourself
to the company money for some time.

05:37.970 --> 05:40.461
It's not like you do anything
for the family anyway.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.507
Gob doesn't do anything
for the family.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.042
Hey, I'm-
[Bleeps] Lucille 2.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.237
Oh. I could do
something like that.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.748
<i>This is what Dad was really good at</i>- 
<i>getting us out of tight spots.</i>

05:50.850 --> 05:55.184
<i>[Narrator] In fact, at that very moment,</i>
<i>George Sr.</i> was <i>in a tight spot...</i>

05:55.288 --> 05:57.916
<i>as he'd gotten himself</i>
<i>wedged under the furnace...</i>

05:58.024 --> 06:01.619
<i>while chasing after a sour ball</i>
<i>that had rolled out ofhis pocket.</i>

06:01.728 --> 06:05.528
[Sighs, Howls]

06:05.631 --> 06:07.599
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Eventually, Michael rescued him.</i>

06:07.700 --> 06:09.827
<i>[Michael] I'm starting to worry</i>
<i>she's gonna sell us out.</i>

06:09.936 --> 06:13.269
I think the answer
to this problem is money.

06:13.373 --> 06:17.605
Now, this may just be me having my head against
a hundred-degree furnace for an hour...

06:17.710 --> 06:20.235
but maybe we should
bring in Jack Dorso.

06:20.346 --> 06:24.908
- UncleJack?
- Well, no. He's not my uncle.
He's, uh, my dad's friend.

06:25.017 --> 06:27.281
But, uh, this guy
has got a fortune.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.379
<i>[Narrator]Jack Dorso</i>
<i>first achieved success in the '40s...</i>

06:30.490 --> 06:34.392
<i>as a costar of the radio and then film serial,</i>
Red McGibbon and Bullet: Nazi Hunters.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.395
<i>There are two Nazis</i>
<i>up there in that dance hall.</i>

06:37.497 --> 06:39.431
- <i>[Bullet] Shoot me.</i>
- <i>[Gunshot, Glass Shatters]</i>

06:39.532 --> 06:42.057
[Bullet On Radio]
Happy Valentine's Day, Nazis.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.762
<i>[Narrator] When the actor</i>
<i>who played Red McGibbon...</i>

06:44.871 --> 06:47.669
<i>was jailed for his</i>
<i>Communist sympathies...</i>

06:47.774 --> 06:51.574
<i>Jack Dorso made one attempt</i>
<i>at a solo Bullet feature.</i>

06:51.677 --> 06:55.909
<i>But the audience was not ready</i>
<i>to accept Bullet as a romantic lead...</i>

06:56.015 --> 06:58.882
<i>despite his powerful upper body.</i>

06:58.985 --> 07:00.885
<i>So he started</i>
<i>a chain of gymnasiums...</i>

07:00.987 --> 07:04.718
<i>having stolen the idea</i>
<i>from Red during a prison visit.</i>

07:04.824 --> 07:07.349
<i>- And as the years passed-</i>
<i>- [Man] Hey, Jack!</i>

07:07.460 --> 07:11.920
<i>He became well-known</i>
<i>for his annual birthday feats of strength.</i>

07:12.031 --> 07:15.057
Five pounds for each year of my life.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.228
<i>[Narrator] Sadly, he lost the use</i>
<i>ofhis legs on his 70th birthday</i>- 

07:18.337 --> 07:22.740
- Release!
- <i>at the newly-remodeled Jack Dorso's</i>
<i>in Albany, New York.</i>

07:22.842 --> 07:25.606
- [Cracking]
- [Grunts] Too much!

07:27.480 --> 07:30.108
If he's got so much money,
how come we never called him before?

07:30.216 --> 07:32.878
But I have. I mean, there wouldn't be
a Bluth Company without him.

07:32.985 --> 07:35.317
I could never have afforded
that first tract of land.

07:35.421 --> 07:37.321
But he always wants
something in return.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.323
[Sighs]
I don't know.

07:39.425 --> 07:43.259
See if you can talk your mother into
taking another bullet for the Bluth family.

07:48.868 --> 07:53.328
<i>[Narrator] The family gathered at Lucille's</i>
<i>to welcome and solicit UncleJack.</i>

07:53.439 --> 07:55.430
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>he wasn't really their uncle.</i>

07:55.541 --> 07:59.341
Buster. Nice of you to take a break
from that common whore you've been dating.

07:59.445 --> 08:03.973
She is not a whore, Mother. She happens to
be the new secretary of the Bluth Company.

08:04.083 --> 08:08.645
<i>And, yes, she's more</i> experienced
<i>than a normal girl.</i>

08:08.754 --> 08:13.282
- But sometimes love <i>should</i> be terrifying.
- <i>[Narrator] In fact...</i>

08:13.392 --> 08:16.327
- <i>Buster had even started</i>
<i>using his army stealth training.</i>
- <i>[Starla] Buster.</i>

08:16.429 --> 08:20.024
I'll be right in, and then
maybe we can talk about-

08:20.132 --> 08:23.260
[Grunts]
Makin' that love.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.997
<i>[Door Handle Rattling]</i>

08:26.105 --> 08:31.475
<i>I shouldn't complain. It's better than</i>
<i>you dating Lucille 2, that</i> bitch!

08:31.577 --> 08:35.808
<i>Lucille 2's not a "B,"Mother.</i>
<i>She's kind, and she's caring...</i>

08:35.914 --> 08:39.817
and she's certainly less experienced
than that <i>whore</i> that I'm dating now.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.284
<i>[Narrator] And perhaps it was</i>
<i>screaming it out loud...</i>

08:42.388 --> 08:44.481
<i>that made Buster realize</i>
<i>that he missed Lucille 2.</i>

08:44.590 --> 08:47.889
<i>I'm wondering if you can keep</i>
<i>some of the more piercing profanities down...</i>

08:47.994 --> 08:49.894
when the 90-year-old
fitness buff gets here?

08:49.996 --> 08:52.726
You know, Michael, I was happy
to call UncleJack for you...

08:52.832 --> 08:55.164
but that's as much
as I'm going to do.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.168
If you know what I mean.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.738
- I need a more vital man.
- <i>[Knocking]</i>

08:59.839 --> 09:02.967
<i>[Man] Someone order 140 pounds</i>
<i>of upper-body strength?</i>

09:03.075 --> 09:06.203
Well, he certainly
sounds vital to me.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.780
<i>[Shouting]</i>
<i>Walk, Dragon! Walk!</i>

09:08.881 --> 09:11.349
- Enter the room!
- <i>[Michael] Welcome, UncleJack.</i>

09:11.450 --> 09:15.477
He's half deaf.
It was a stupid, stupid hire.

09:15.588 --> 09:19.251
Not "higher."
Eye level! Eye level!

09:19.358 --> 09:22.225
Kisses, and then we talk.
Which one is Michael?

09:22.328 --> 09:24.523
- Uh-
- Swoop me!

09:26.232 --> 09:29.429
- <i>[Jack] Oh.</i>
- <i>I, uh, really appreciate</i>
<i>you coming over, UncleJack.</i>

09:29.535 --> 09:32.265
Thank you for having me.
You may be amazed.

09:32.371 --> 09:36.102
Uh, I'm invited into
very few personal homes.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.108
To the nuts!

09:39.545 --> 09:42.378
The bridge mix!
The bridge mix! Fool!

09:43.683 --> 09:45.548
Hey, fake UncleJack.

09:45.651 --> 09:49.951
Is this the boy? Is this the little one?
My God, you're an army man.

09:50.056 --> 09:53.355
- Well- [Chuckles]
- I was never in the army. I was in the pictures.

09:53.459 --> 09:56.257
Here comes UncleJack. Shoot me!

09:56.362 --> 09:58.922
- [Screams] Oh, God!
- [Gasps]

09:59.031 --> 10:02.762
- <i>[Buster Groans]</i>
- Look at that. I pinned him. I pinned the army man.

10:02.868 --> 10:07.271
God bless you for being in the army.
Up, Dragon!

10:07.373 --> 10:12.743
- [Whimpering]
- Lift. Lift with vigor.

10:12.845 --> 10:17.339
- Remember me?
- <i>Lucille. You look younger</i>
<i>than you did the day l</i>- 

10:17.450 --> 10:21.284
- Oh, you old fool. I'm Lucille.
- [Screams]

10:21.387 --> 10:26.188
You look fabulous.
Back to the blonde. Back to the blonde.

10:27.393 --> 10:30.521
Isn't she beautiful? Oh, yeah.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.757
[Makes Gobbling Noise]

10:32.865 --> 10:34.423
He's kind of scary, that guy, huh?

10:34.533 --> 10:36.933
Not to me.
I think he's kind of cool.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.664
Well, why don't you go get your kiss
from Mr. Cool Half-Man?

10:39.772 --> 10:41.672
- [Scoffs] I'd be fine with that.
- Let's go.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.605
- So what's your point?
- Come on.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.973
Why, she's no bigger
than one of my legs.

10:46.078 --> 10:48.876
Shake them for her.
[Grunting]

10:48.981 --> 10:51.108
Excuse me, UncleJack.
I'm George Michael.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.708
[Gurgles]
It's okay. Just ignore it!

10:53.819 --> 10:57.448
Ignore it. Just something the body does
when you're shaken. [Gurgles]

10:57.556 --> 10:59.353
<i>Don't shake it!</i>
<i>Don't shake it!</i>

10:59.458 --> 11:01.358
- Towel!
- Not the good ones!

11:01.460 --> 11:04.361
- Is he dying? What if he's dying?
- [Gurgling Continues]

11:05.731 --> 11:08.359
Boy, that Dragon's cute, huh?
[Sighs]

11:08.467 --> 11:10.526
What, the deaf giant
who's holding our fake uncle?

11:10.636 --> 11:12.831
He's been flirting
with me all night.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.498
I was thinking maybe it would
be best for the family...

11:15.608 --> 11:19.203
if I went on that romance thing
with Drag instead ofTobias...

11:19.311 --> 11:21.245
which would <i>be</i> a drag.
[Snickers]

11:21.347 --> 11:24.510
- [Chuckles]
- Yeah, that's just the kind of joke Drag can't hear.

11:24.617 --> 11:28.883
No, you're gonna go with Tobias or not at all.
Now tell me what you found out at Sitwell.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.388
- Oh. You still want me to do that?
- You didn't?

11:31.490 --> 11:34.721
Lindsay, I give you one thing to do
for the business, and you can't even do it.

11:34.827 --> 11:37.819
I mean, if you'd tried and failed,
I'd understand, but you didn't even try.

11:37.930 --> 11:41.730
So, I didn't even fail, and I don't see you
giving me credit for that.

11:41.834 --> 11:45.497
- [Sighs]
- <i>[Narrator] Michael knew</i>
<i>that since Lindsay let him down...</i>

11:45.604 --> 11:51.270
<i>he had no choice but to ask UncleJack</i>
<i>for the money to save his company.</i>

11:51.377 --> 11:53.971
- Pretty.
- Yes.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.210
Do you think you should be perched
on the edge of the building like this?

11:58.317 --> 12:00.751
Oh, Dragon's got me.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.317
- Dragon's in the bathroom.
- Mama!

12:05.424 --> 12:09.019
- Come on. I got ya. I got ya. It's okay.
- [Grunts, Whimpers]

12:09.128 --> 12:12.859
- <i>[Narrator] And so Michael laid out his dilemma.</i>
...family company get ruined.

12:12.965 --> 12:17.800
- I was hoping that this was a social visit-
- Well-

12:17.903 --> 12:22.431
particularly when that sister of yours
started giving me the cutie eye.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.236
- [Growling]
- She did?

12:24.343 --> 12:29.508
Unfortunately that moose was holding me,
so I couldn't make my move.

12:29.615 --> 12:34.211
Of course I couldn't make that move
without that moose, but that's my challenge.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.982
I won't go wheelchair!

12:37.089 --> 12:39.057
Twirl me around.

12:40.993 --> 12:44.121
Hey, hey. No.
I got you. I got you.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.289
- [Coughs]
- You all right?

12:46.398 --> 12:50.357
But Valentine's Day is here,
and I'm alone.

12:50.469 --> 12:52.403
The moose is no one.

12:52.505 --> 12:56.168
Perhaps if I had
a little... companionship...

12:56.275 --> 13:00.211
I'd be a little more
disposed to whip out...

13:00.312 --> 13:03.076
that old wallet of mine.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.810
You're saying if I were
to set you up with my sister...

13:05.918 --> 13:09.410
- you would consider bailing us out?
- Oh, joy. Yeah.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.422
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael was torn.</i>

13:11.524 --> 13:14.459
- <i>The business meant the world</i>
<i>to him, but his sister's honor</i>- 
- Let's do it.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.256
- <i>uh, meant a lot too.</i>
- Let's go share the good news.

13:23.035 --> 13:26.300
<i>[Narrator] Michael had offered his sister</i>
<i>to his UncleJack...</i>

13:26.405 --> 13:28.805
<i>in exchange for money</i>
<i>to save the company.</i>

13:28.908 --> 13:31.308
<i>Remember, it's not their real uncle.</i>

13:31.410 --> 13:35.346
- He's cute, isn't he?
- So cute.

13:35.447 --> 13:38.780
- Imagine him without that muscly
little old guy in his arms.
- Oh, Dragon. Right.

13:38.884 --> 13:43.116
Well, that's why I was thinking maybe you
should go with Dragon on that romantic getaway.

13:43.222 --> 13:45.622
- Oh.
- Now, I know he's working...

13:45.724 --> 13:47.954
so UncleJack's
gonna have to go along.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.688
Oh. Well, as long as
he promises not to shake him.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.787
- Mmm.
- So, what did he say about the money?

13:52.898 --> 13:56.334
[Inhales]
He said he'd like to sleep on it.

13:56.435 --> 14:00.496
<i>[Narrator] Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Buster had decided to pursue a new girlfriend:</i>

14:00.606 --> 14:02.506
<i>His old girlfriend.</i>

14:02.608 --> 14:04.974
Hey- Brother?
What are you doing here?

14:05.077 --> 14:07.739
I'm keeping an eye on the woman
who controls our company.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.815
In her robe and slippies?

14:09.915 --> 14:14.545
Getting into her head. I think she's planning
on selling our company to Stan Sitwell.

14:14.653 --> 14:18.487
But I've lost her trail, and I don't think
I have the skills to pick it up.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.219
Skills?
[Grunts]

14:25.197 --> 14:27.097
These kind of skills?

14:27.199 --> 14:29.827
Not really.

14:29.935 --> 14:34.031
But if you give me one of those outfits,
we can hide in the bushes and spy on them.

14:35.241 --> 14:38.404
I would like to see her again.
You've got it.

14:38.510 --> 14:42.276
<i>[Narrator] And Michael told his father</i>
<i>the good news about UncleJack.</i>

14:42.414 --> 14:45.577
- You are pimping out your sister?
- You were pimping out my mother.

14:45.684 --> 14:49.085
Yes, because she was
sleeping with my brother, but your sister?

14:49.188 --> 14:51.850
Everything's gonna be fine.
No one's gonna get hurt.

14:51.957 --> 14:54.118
No one is going to get hurt.

14:54.226 --> 14:58.390
<i>Oh. Hey, Michael. My dad wanted me</i>
<i>to thank you for the romantic getaway.</i>

14:58.497 --> 15:00.522
Don't tell me what that means.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.693
- Where is your dad?
- He left, dressed all western-y.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.702
You could leave me
out of that part too.

15:05.804 --> 15:09.035
<i>[Narrator] And Michael realized</i>
<i>that perhaps somebody would get hurt.</i>

15:09.141 --> 15:13.237
- I just screwed my brother-in-law.
- Well, I'm all grown up now.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.905
<i>[Narrator] So Michael rushed</i>
<i>to the Four Seas Hotel...</i>

15:16.015 --> 15:19.143
<i>to keep Tobias from finding out</i>
<i>about Lindsay's date.</i>

15:19.251 --> 15:22.379
Michael, this is Jeff.
He does all the horse work here.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.286
You'll meet him again at the end.
Plus, he gets you your juice.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.155
Not your first juice,
but the one you get at the spa.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.718
- That's right. You've done this before.
- But not with a lovely lady.

15:31.830 --> 15:36.062
Jeff doubts one's coming at all,
don't you? Sorry. Sorry.

15:36.168 --> 15:38.602
- About the lovely lady-
- <i>[Van Door Opens]</i>

15:39.838 --> 15:42.534
Stop. You dropped the boot.
Dropped the boot.

15:44.243 --> 15:47.906
<i>[Narrator] Michael came up with</i>
<i>the only evasion he could think of.</i>

15:48.013 --> 15:51.039
<i>Tobias, the lovely lady, she's gonna be</i>
<i>a little bit late. She's doing some work.</i>

15:51.150 --> 15:53.050
She said to get started without her.

15:53.152 --> 15:56.588
- Saddle me up, Jeff.
- It's gonna take a few minutes
to tack another horse.

15:56.689 --> 16:01.854
<i>[Narrator] So Michael embarked on</i>
<i>the romantic adventure he'd spent so lavishly for.</i>

16:01.961 --> 16:05.692
[Tobias] Well, you certainly didn't help
with my reputation as a lady's man with Jeff.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.528
But we'll clear all that up in the spa
when I get my <i>facial.</i>

16:08.634 --> 16:11.034
Hey, did you ever get
that tape recorder?

16:11.136 --> 16:15.232
[Chuckles] You're funny.
Come on, boy. Hoo-cha-cha!

16:15.341 --> 16:19.004
<i>[Narrator] Soon the next group</i>
<i>began their romantic date.</i>

16:19.111 --> 16:21.807
- So nice of you to cover this, UncleJack.
- My pleasure.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.109
It's nice to do something
you don't need legs for.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.945
[Yells]

16:30.289 --> 16:33.383
[Spits, Gurgles]
Towel!

16:33.492 --> 16:36.984
<i>[Narrator] And Lucille 2</i>
<i>showed up with Stan Sitwell...</i>

<i>who did look a little</i>
<i>like Edgar Winter.</i>

16:39.765 --> 16:45.670
<i>And one by one, they each enjoyed</i>
<i>the activities of their romantic getaways.</i>

16:45.771 --> 16:48.035
- Body chocolate?
- No.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.131
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Of course, in the spa...</i>

16:50.242 --> 16:55.202
<i>thejets proved too powerful</i>
<i>for UncleJack's tiny legs.</i>

16:55.314 --> 17:00.217
<i>The spa portion also proved challenging</i>
<i>to Stan Sitwell and Lucille 2...</i>

17:00.319 --> 17:03.083
<i>who in turn</i>
<i>were being followed by Buster...</i>

17:04.990 --> 17:07.049
<i>and Gob.</i>

17:08.594 --> 17:11.188
<i>And soon, Michael and Tobias</i>
<i>awaited their massage therapists.</i>

17:11.296 --> 17:13.355
- [Humming]
- So, uh, Tobias...

17:13.464 --> 17:17.663
I'm afraid that your wife
might not actually end up here with you.

17:17.770 --> 17:21.501
You know, Michael, perhaps
I should buy <i>you</i> that tape recorder.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.405
Do you have any idea how often
you say the word "afraid"?

17:24.510 --> 17:26.501
Well, I know I used it
in theJacuzzi.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.547
And I apologize for that.
I thought it was a pool toy.

17:29.648 --> 17:32.412
<i>But you were supposed</i>
<i>to be here with Sally Sitwell...</i>

17:32.518 --> 17:35.248
but... you were afraid
to ask her.

17:35.354 --> 17:39.188
So what do you do? You create issues,
and you make up imaginary problems...

17:39.291 --> 17:42.419
like this merger
I hear you're worried about.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.723
Well, uh, you're probably right-

17:44.830 --> 17:48.459
- [Shouting]
- About me being afraid of the word "No," but-

17:48.567 --> 17:51.001
You know, the merger's real.
I'm not imagining that.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.537
Lucille! Michael.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.039
- Michael?
- What are you doing here?

17:56.141 --> 17:58.871
Following Lucille 2.
She's with Sitwell.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.411
She probably figured
that we'd never track her.

18:01.513 --> 18:04.914
[Chuckles] But we lost her.
Everyone put on white robes and outsmarted us.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.952
Lucille! Lindsay?

18:08.053 --> 18:10.715
- [Jack Grunts]
- Lindsay.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.883
Wait, wait, wait.
Lindsay's here? With two men?

18:13.992 --> 18:15.892
Sort of one and a half.

18:15.994 --> 18:18.462
Tobias. Hey, Tobias!

18:19.865 --> 18:22.766
Lindsay, look. L- Oh.
Lucille 2. I'm sorry.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.836
- And, miss, I don't know your name.
- <i>Tobias?</i>

18:24.937 --> 18:27.235
Lucille? Sitwell? What's this?

18:27.339 --> 18:29.307
It's our romantic getaway, Michael.

18:29.408 --> 18:32.571
Romantic? So, then the company
isn't being taken over...

18:32.678 --> 18:35.306
so Lindsay doesn't have
to be with UncleJack?

18:35.414 --> 18:38.850
Oh, Tobias.
We gotta stop Linds-Tobias?

18:38.951 --> 18:42.182
- How'd you like to take a nap, baldy?
- [Gob] I'll handle this.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.279
She's my girlfriend, pal.
Take him down, Buster.

18:45.390 --> 18:48.689
Your girlfriend? That's why
you were in her robe and slippies.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.887
You weren't trying
to get into her head.

18:50.996 --> 18:54.022

[Grunts] She's not with him.
She's with the Bullet.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.479
Oh, thank God.

<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>Tobias? Tobias, I'm sorry.</i>

19:37.176 --> 19:39.804
I set this up for Lindsay.
Lindsay, I'm sorry.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.847
- You were not on a date with Dragon.
- I know that, Michael.

19:42.948 --> 19:46.145
It was pretty obvious when Dragon
kept swooping UncleJack in for a kiss.

19:46.251 --> 19:49.550
<i>You said I never did anything</i>
<i>for the company. L-I just thought I'd try.</i>

19:49.655 --> 19:54.149
<i>Tobias, I never thought</i>
<i>you'd ever fight for me.</i>

19:54.259 --> 19:58.662
I had no idea a 90-year-old man
could cave in my chest cavity like that.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.995
Dragon, would you mind
carrying my husband to the car?

20:03.602 --> 20:05.536
- [Cracking]
- [Screams]

20:11.743 --> 20:14.211
I think I snapped one of his ribs.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.838
<i>No. It's my leg.</i>

20:16.949 --> 20:19.349
I'll bet that would hurt.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.420
I guess the deal's off now,
now that I actually need you to help us out?

20:22.521 --> 20:25.718
<i>I'll make you a deal.</i>
<i>You carry me, and I'll carry you.</i>

20:25.824 --> 20:28.190
Thanks, UncleJack.

20:28.293 --> 20:31.421
- Yeah. I think we should get to the hospital.
- Let me see.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.863
I think this duct tape is the only thing
that's keeping the ankle on.

20:34.967 --> 20:39.802
Okay. Ah. Right around there.
Oh. I think you're right inside me now.
