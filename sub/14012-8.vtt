<i> In the criminal justice system</i>

00:02.319 --> 00:04.470
<i> the people are represented</i>
<i> by two separate</i>

00:04.472 --> 00:06.338
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:08.207
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:08.209 --> 00:10.776
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:13.412
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:14.482 --> 00:16.582

(<i> man laughs</i> )

00:32.800 --> 00:34.333
(<i> screams</i> )

00:35.269 --> 00:37.069
Sorry.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.441
Hey, watch
it, girl.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.346
Oh! Get away from me!

00:49.417 --> 00:51.383
OFFICER:
I'll bet you never
cut class, either.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.218
(<i> chuckles</i> )

00:53.220 --> 00:56.388
Me? I was a fine upstanding
picture of American manhood.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.623
Yeah, sure.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.526
Oh, look at this.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.262
Get off me!
(<i> siren wails</i> )

01:03.264 --> 01:04.263
Get off me!

01:04.265 --> 01:05.831
MAN:
Shut up!

01:05.833 --> 01:07.266
Okay, you two,
take it easy!

01:07.268 --> 01:08.300
Take it easy.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.102
I was just trying
to help her.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.336
She's going
to get run over, man.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.405
They grabbed me.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.240
They pushed me down...

01:16.277 --> 01:18.277
Give me
a little help here.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.112
Come on.
Come on, darling.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.380
Come on,
darling, get up.
Come on.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.383
Um, sophomore,
University of Manhattan.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.351
Says she was raped
by several men--

01:26.353 --> 01:28.120
Halloween party.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.189
No vaginal
or perineal abrasions.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.290
Got any signs
of intercourse?

01:31.292 --> 01:32.591
There was semen present.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.093
You send out
the kit?

01:34.095 --> 01:36.161
Yeah, also ran a blood test;
she was drunk.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.362
How drunk?
Very.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.565
If she'd been driving,
she'd be under arrest.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.599
Blood alcohol's .13.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.167
All right, can
we talk to her?

01:42.169 --> 01:43.736
She's out cold,

01:43.737 --> 01:45.304
and I don't know how much
she's going to remember.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.372
Doc, can we stop the waltz?
What are you saying?

01:47.374 --> 01:49.374
Obvious emotional trauma.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.476
Rape?

01:50.478 --> 01:52.711
We offered her a counselor.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.379
She said no.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.670
WOMAN (<i> over PA system</i> ):
All on-duty interns please
report to nurse's station five.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.205
All interns please report...

03:26.207 --> 03:29.208
WOMAN:
I was invited to the party.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.876
By the men
who assaulted you?

03:30.878 --> 03:33.212
My fiancé, Gary Burnham.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.913
He was a pledge
at Theta Pi.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.648
Your fiancé assaulted you?

03:36.650 --> 03:39.551
No.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.753
Look, can you identify the boys
who did this?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.956
Somebody helped me upstairs.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.958
It was some kind of...

03:45.960 --> 03:49.695
he was wearing
some kind of animal.

03:49.697 --> 03:50.729
What kind of animal?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.965
What color?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.536
It was light.

03:57.538 --> 04:03.242
I think, maybe, um...
gray or brown.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.812
Can't you give us a little
better idea of what went on?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.849
They offered me a drink.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.751
Who?

04:12.753 --> 04:15.721
Um... I'm not sure.

04:15.723 --> 04:18.991
It's all fuzzy, but...

04:18.993 --> 04:23.762
I think Ted Campion
and Joel Holder--

04:23.764 --> 04:25.831
two of Gary's friends--
were there.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.735
I'm pretty sure Ted
had the bottle-- Scotch.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.803
I was drinking
from it.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.039
And...

04:35.943 --> 04:39.711
...I think there was something
over my face.

04:39.713 --> 04:43.949
Um... and they
were on top of me,

04:43.951 --> 04:46.618
and I tried
to scream.

04:48.756 --> 04:52.958
Um... I must have passed out.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.428
The next thing,

04:56.430 --> 04:59.998
I was alone in the room...

05:00.000 --> 05:02.834
looking for my clothes.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.637
So Ted and Joel assaulted you?

05:07.608 --> 05:10.309
I think so.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.711
You know, you had been drinking
a little bit.

05:12.713 --> 05:16.815
Rape's a serious accusation
based on "I think so."

05:16.817 --> 05:18.784
(<i> sighs</i> )

05:18.786 --> 05:23.655
I was drunk, and I was scared,
but I know what happened.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.025
I<i> was</i> raped.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.760
She said what?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.095
This is crazy.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.763
Joel, did you even
see her?

05:31.765 --> 05:34.366
I didn't even know
she was here.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.001
Is this serious?

05:36.003 --> 05:39.004
Maybe we should talk
to a lawyer.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.773
We never even went upstairs.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.643
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Look, guys, this didn't happen.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.778
A girl comes
to your party,

05:46.780 --> 05:49.881
and just for the hell
of it, she charges rape?

05:49.883 --> 05:52.017
Everybody knows
about Andrea.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.418
Well, we don't know.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.753
Why don't you
fill us in?

05:54.755 --> 05:57.422
A pledge of ours,
Gary Burnham

05:57.424 --> 06:00.492
he was getting serious
about her.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.760
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Freshmen.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.795
He didn't know
about her reputation.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.497
About which you so
generously informed him.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.766
She's an easy score,
okay?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.368
Gary's a little naive.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.469
Gary dropped her.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.838
She stormed in here
last week,

06:12.840 --> 06:13.939
claimed we ruined
her life.

06:13.941 --> 06:17.442
And then she said
we'd regret it.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.448
You don't mind if we call
in a few technicians

06:23.450 --> 06:24.816
to look around, do you?

06:24.818 --> 06:27.786
No problem.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.688
The wolf pack
is having a feast here.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.123
Where are they getting
this stuff?

06:31.125 --> 06:32.791
Somebody at
the hospital.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.460
Did CSU find anything
in the boys' room?

06:35.462 --> 06:37.028
No. No hair, no fiber,
no nothing.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.064
I got to tell you, if
these boys are lying,

06:39.066 --> 06:40.399
they're pretty cool
about it.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.767
Granted.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.802
Except their story
makes no sense.

06:43.804 --> 06:44.920
If she wants revenge,

06:44.921 --> 06:46.037
why didn't she give us
a sure ID?

06:46.039 --> 06:47.439
Why make it harder on herself?

06:47.441 --> 06:48.807
Maybe she didn't want
it to sound so pat.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.041
It gives her an out
if things go wrong.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.710
Come on.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.812
You want revenge, you don't turn
your life into a circus.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.714
What am I hearing here?

06:55.716 --> 06:56.815
This girl's not on trial.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.450
I know that,
but we got no witnesses.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.185
So far, nobody even
saw her there.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.720
These fraternity brothers
are going to say

07:01.722 --> 07:02.854
that Joel and Ted
never left the party

07:02.856 --> 07:04.423
and that Andrea
made a public threat.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.891
(<i> sighs</i> )

07:05.893 --> 07:08.427
Gee, somebody's lying.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.162
Well, that makes you

07:10.164 --> 07:11.830
detective
of the month, Mike.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.650
Any bets on who?

07:14.651 --> 07:17.469
I mean, did they log who
she called from the hospital?

07:19.072 --> 07:22.073
An advisor,
English professor.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.109
She was afraid
to call her mother.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.845
Students. Sometimes
they make us their mothers.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.547
How do you like
your new daughter?

07:28.549 --> 07:30.265
What's not to like?

07:30.266 --> 07:31.982
Wants to take every course
in the department.

07:31.985 --> 07:35.754
How about her social life?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.339
It was active.

07:37.340 --> 07:38.923
You mean she had a lot
of boyfriends?

07:38.926 --> 07:41.460
Look, her parents divorced
when she was six.

07:41.462 --> 07:44.496
Is she looking for a male figure
in her life? Sure.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.932
How about if she got one
and lost him?

07:46.934 --> 07:49.067
You think she'd be capable
of wanting to get back at him?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.969
Am I getting a message here?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.038
You have some doubt
Andrea was raped?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.473
You think she made it up?

07:54.475 --> 07:55.907
Did I say that?

07:55.909 --> 07:59.945
There is nothing so powerful
as the unspoken.

08:02.216 --> 08:05.016
Did she get along as well
with women as she did with men?

08:05.018 --> 08:07.819
I advise a student,
Betsy Rawls.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.921
Works in the college bookstore
with Andrea.

08:09.923 --> 08:15.126
That is, if you want to talk
to people who like her.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.595
Poor Andrea.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.598
She sends out a come-on
without even knowing it.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.601
Are you saying that she
asked for this to happen?

08:22.603 --> 08:25.871
Did they give you guys
insensitivity seminars?

08:27.641 --> 08:29.908
No woman asks
to be raped.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.277
I'm just saying that
she gives it off.

08:32.279 --> 08:36.081
You know, heat?
Pheromones?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.083
Men hit on her.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.285
It's not her fault.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.220
What about
the boyfriend?
Gary?

08:42.222 --> 08:46.625
He's sweet, but Andrea
has a good imagination.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.860
Marriage, fiancé?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.061
He's 18.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.830
I got married,
I was 20.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.666
It's a different generation,
Sergeant.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.068
Mm-hmm.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.070
Do you want my opinion?

08:59.072 --> 09:02.173
Andrea doesn't know
who the hell she is.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.582
She said I was her fiancé?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.951
We just dated, that's all.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.219
Did you have a date
with her last night?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.221
What's this about?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.222
Andrea says she was raped at
your fraternity house last night

09:18.225 --> 09:19.925
during the Halloween party.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.028
Oh, my God.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.963
Did you see her there?

09:24.965 --> 09:27.132
Why would she be there?

09:27.134 --> 09:28.934
We-We broke up.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.069
Why did you break up
with her, Gary?

09:33.006 --> 09:37.709
I met her...
she's, uh, very sophisticated.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.946
Dating a sophomore,
it made me feel good.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.217
I found out some things
about her.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.954
When you broke it off,
was she very upset?

09:48.956 --> 09:51.623
She called me all the time,
showed up at my classes.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.892
The whole thing
got out of control.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.928
It's funny, she doesn't seem
that intimidating to me.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.130
I never knew what she'd do next.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.199
Want to see what I mean?

10:04.137 --> 10:06.037
This is the last letter
she sent me.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.006
Mm-hmm.

10:09.676 --> 10:13.712
"If you hurt me,
I promise I'll hurt you worse.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.947
I'll ruin your life."

10:20.253 --> 10:22.020
Boyfriend says she's wacko.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.622
She says they're
going to get married.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.756
They're kids; that's
how they talk.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.991
She comes on to guys.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.626
She doesn't mean to.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.761
And she can't quite point
the finger at who raped her.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.446
What the hell
do you want?

10:31.447 --> 10:33.130
Signed confessions from the
boys and a dozen witnesses?

10:33.133 --> 10:36.167
What I want is a victim
who can testify

10:36.169 --> 10:37.769
to the DA
without killing the case.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.305
Right now, they'd be lucky
to get an indictment.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.708
Let's talk to the roommate.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.310
After Barbara and I
moved in last year,

10:45.312 --> 10:47.145
they raised the rent.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.714
We put up a notice,
Andrea called.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.249
She took the apartment
sight unseen.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.284
Mm.
That's a little
impulsive.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.786
That's Andrea.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.222
Changes courses every other day.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.790
Boyfriends, too?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.325
No more
than most women today.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.793
That's one man's opinion.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.663
Okay, maybe a little
more than most,

11:04.665 --> 11:06.765
but she was frank
about it.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.799
She likes men.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.001
There's nothing wrong
with that.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.436
When Andrea got back
from the hospital,

11:11.438 --> 11:13.104
did she talk about anything
that happened?

11:13.106 --> 11:15.373
Yeah, she said
she had been raped.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.776
Any details?

11:17.778 --> 11:20.178
Well, it was all
pretty confused.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.048
There was something
about a room,

11:23.050 --> 11:24.783
everything going dark.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.785
She was very
shaken up.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.287
So she seemed like a women
who'd just been raped?

11:29.289 --> 11:31.289
Geez, yes.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.459
She was hurt, angry.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.761
Did you get any read off her?

11:36.763 --> 11:38.129
After 50 minutes?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.698
How about some
top-of-the-mind,

11:39.700 --> 11:42.701
inadmissible,
subjective impressions?

11:42.703 --> 11:45.170
Just as long as you don't go
out on a limb.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.773
Is it just me or all women
with triple-digit IQs?

11:48.775 --> 11:51.409
Well, you're the only one
I know, Doc.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.011
Andrea Fermi?

11:53.013 --> 11:56.114
Do I think she consented
to have sex? No.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.050
Do I think she's
emotionally disturbed? Yes.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.385
How disturbed?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.788
Disturbed enough
that she needs to be in therapy.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.458
It's not uncommon,
and she fits the profile:

12:06.460 --> 12:07.859
Parents divorced,

12:07.861 --> 12:11.029
desperation for a relationship
with a male,

12:11.031 --> 12:13.732
inability to tolerate
rejection, making threats.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.234
Look, girls are bombarded
with images

12:16.236 --> 12:18.236
of who they should be
to get boys:

12:18.238 --> 12:20.472
ads, movies, Madonna.

12:20.474 --> 12:23.041
They end up playing
a stereotypical role:

12:23.043 --> 12:26.077
a highly-sexualized adult woman.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.780
But in reality, they're just
children seeking approval.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.749
Was she raped or not?

12:30.751 --> 12:33.218
I'd say absolutely, but...

12:33.220 --> 12:34.753
But what?

12:34.755 --> 12:37.055
Based on her previous
sexual behavior,

12:37.057 --> 12:39.290
the boys
may have convinced themselves

12:39.292 --> 12:41.192
that she didn't care.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.065
DNA test on the samples

12:47.067 --> 12:49.200
gives us intercourse
with two men.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.802
You still need
proof of that rape.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.287
Not in court, you don't.

12:52.288 --> 12:53.771
The law says
no corroboration necessary.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.307
Fine, but without
it, you don't get a
conviction from a jury.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.076
Unfortunately, he's right.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.844
She was drunk, and her rep
ain't exactly spotless.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.147
Okay, so all the men
and half the women

13:02.149 --> 13:03.815
are going to say
she was asking for it.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.450
Date rape, maybe.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.085
But this?

13:07.087 --> 13:09.354
Nobody asks to be gang-raped.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.790
Just go talk to her.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.175
Tell her
what the problems are.

13:13.176 --> 13:14.559
Maybe she'll give you
something else.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.797
FERMI:
<i> All right, so I was drunk,</i>

13:18.799 --> 13:20.799
and I'm not a virgin.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.534
So I'm not the perfect victim.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.536
If those boys say
they never saw her,

13:24.538 --> 13:26.672
they're lying.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.807
Mrs. Fermi, we are trying
to help your daughter.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.208
You heard from Gary lately?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.811
No...

13:32.813 --> 13:36.815
but then I guess what do you say
to a raped fiancé?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.950
He told us you weren't engaged.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.856
I guess
that's what you say.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.391
He said you two had broken up,

13:46.393 --> 13:47.826
and there was no
date for the party.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.561
Well, that's not true!

13:49.562 --> 13:51.295
And he did invite me
to the party.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.864
Well, I guess he's lying, too.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.169
I don't believe that he said
we weren't engaged.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.304
And that you threatened him.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.505
He showed us a letter.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.507
One of my letters?
Mm-hmm.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.576
Show them his, Andrea.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.589
"You've changed my life.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.591
"I want that change
to be permanent.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.626
Don't be shocked, but...

14:21.628 --> 14:24.929
I want to marry you."

14:28.401 --> 14:32.437
Now which one of us is lying?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.474
BURNHAM:
<i>Okay, in the heat of the moment</i>

14:36.476 --> 14:38.643
I wrote something foolish.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.246
Not to mention
lying to us.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.082
You guys, you
don't know Andrea.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.417
She got crazy;
she scared me.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.653
But you're still saying
you didn't see her at the party

14:48.655 --> 14:50.455
and know nothing about the rape?

14:52.425 --> 14:53.892
Like I told you.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.660
CERRETA:
Why don't you
talk to her?

14:55.662 --> 14:57.562
This is a girl you wanted
to marry.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.463
She gets raped, you don't even
call to see how she is?

14:59.466 --> 15:02.166
They said it would be
better if I didn't.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.968
They?

15:06.907 --> 15:10.174
Ted, Joel--
all the officers.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.049
As vice president,
I warned Gary.

15:18.051 --> 15:21.185
These allegations could damage
the fraternity.

15:21.187 --> 15:24.088
You warned him
not to speak to Andrea?

15:24.090 --> 15:27.592
Well, we were told it's better
if there's no contact

15:27.594 --> 15:29.160
between any house members
and Andrea.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.129
Mm-hmm, yeah,
Gary's a pledge,

15:31.131 --> 15:33.031
So that applies
to him, too.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.699
Hey, we're glad
to cooperate,

15:34.701 --> 15:36.167
but we were also told

15:36.169 --> 15:38.202
since Joel and I are mentioned
by name,

15:38.204 --> 15:40.638
that we shouldn't talk to you
without counsel present.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.540
That's your legal right.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.676
We're sorry about Andrea.

15:44.678 --> 15:49.080
It's just we wish she wouldn't
have fantasies on our premises.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.082
On your premises?

15:51.084 --> 15:53.685
I thought she wasn't here
that night?

15:53.687 --> 15:56.988
LOGAN:
Just to double-check.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.157
None of you went upstairs
for even a few minutes

15:59.159 --> 16:01.025
the entire night, right?

16:01.027 --> 16:03.161
ALL:
No.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.199
Did someone mention
the word "cooperation"?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.702
Try different questions.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.337
Maybe we try
different people.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.206
You have the list
of your party guests

16:15.208 --> 16:17.041
and your employees
for that party?

16:17.043 --> 16:18.209
We'd be glad to get you one.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.544
But there's always crashers.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.213
Yeah, from on and off campus.

16:22.215 --> 16:26.517
Hey, if there really was a rape,
it could have been anyone.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.353
Okay, the boyfriend
did lie.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.254
That kid knows something.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.090
I think what he knows
is how to take orders

16:32.092 --> 16:34.092
from his upperclassmen
and keep his mouth shut.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.195
A six-hour party--
nobody sees anybody go upstairs?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.663
Nobody goes upstairs himself?

16:38.665 --> 16:41.132
Yeah, right, like they
don't serve liquor to minors.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.418
What?
A misdemeanor charge?

16:43.419 --> 16:45.703
You think that's going
to crack the wall of silence?

16:45.705 --> 16:48.239
All right,
we got 70, 80 names here.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.741
Probably take us
right up to retirement.

16:49.743 --> 16:51.943
I would start with anybody
who isn't, wasn't,

16:51.944 --> 16:54.144
and never will be a member
of that fraternity.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.115
Maybe she wasn't there.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.950
We get one more no,

16:58.951 --> 17:00.784
you got to think everybody
was as drunk as she was.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.054
Who's next?

17:05.025 --> 17:07.025
Sorry, I might
have served her,

17:07.027 --> 17:09.360
but there were
at least 100 kids there.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.762
He must have
some eyesight, huh?

17:10.764 --> 17:12.797
I can't help you.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.265
Hey, listen, come here.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.135
You think you served
any underage kids there?

17:17.137 --> 17:18.169
Oh, come on.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.271
Maybe we could find a few.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.173
All right, listen,
I'll level with you.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.710
I did two years' hard time,
and I'm almost off parole.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.379
Working parties and bartending
is a no-no.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.049
Cool it, we're not
the parole division.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.116
All right.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.118
Pigtails had on
the wrong costume.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.120
She looked like
a little girl,

17:36.122 --> 17:38.723
but she can drink like
a sand dune.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.091
How much?

17:40.093 --> 17:41.726
Eight or ten shots, easy.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.162
Yeah, enough to put me
into a long dream.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.697
Anybody follow her,
you know, go upstairs?

17:46.699 --> 17:48.166
Well, I was tracking her.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.201
I thought she might be my score
for the night,

17:50.203 --> 17:51.836
but she staggered out
with some guy.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.404
That was the last I saw of her.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.773
Would you recognize this guy
if you saw him again?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.075
No. Too dark.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.177
His mask was
half off his face--

17:59.179 --> 18:00.344
some costume...

18:00.346 --> 18:02.447
What kind of costume--
an animal?

18:02.449 --> 18:03.848
Yeah, that's right.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.217
Yeah. What kind of animal?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.652
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Sorry.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.620
It had big ears.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.290
If that's any help.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.326
At least we know
she was there.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.728
Oh, yeah, with an animal
that has big ears.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.330
Where does that get us?

18:19.332 --> 18:21.199
Two steps ahead
of where we were yesterday.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.733
With no corroboration.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.636
Oh, gee, Mike
why don't we just quit?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.638
Next up,
Gail, Stuart Carradine,

18:27.640 --> 18:29.674
grad students.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.742
Good.
Very good.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.211
We were only there
for a half an hour.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.479
We're not, uh...

18:34.481 --> 18:36.380
My wife and I aren't
really party people, so...

18:36.382 --> 18:39.150
So, nothing strange happened?

18:41.221 --> 18:43.488
It was Halloween...
but rape?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.890
No.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.692
(<i> coughing</i> )

18:48.795 --> 18:50.895
Excuse me, may I have
some water?

18:50.897 --> 18:52.263
Sure.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.265
Thank you.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.237
Must be something in the air.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.305
I feel like
I'm swallowing ashes.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.245
It doesn't take Sigmund Freud

19:07.247 --> 19:09.247
to see that you're nervous,
Gail.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.681
(<i> sighs</i> )

19:10.683 --> 19:12.183
Can you believe it?

19:12.185 --> 19:13.384
I was a ballerina.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.785
I felt ridiculous.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.787
I didn't even want to go,

19:16.789 --> 19:18.923
and all those TPs act like
they own the world.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.525
Stuart used to be president.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.927
Thought he had outgrown
all that crap.

19:22.929 --> 19:26.297
We went upstairs.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.699
I went to the bathroom.
What the hell
are you doing?

19:28.701 --> 19:30.168
What are you telling him?
Just what I saw.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.402
It's none
of their business.

19:31.404 --> 19:34.238
This is rape,
not a college prank.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.843
Go ahead.
This is our business.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.912
I came out
of the bathroom,

19:40.914 --> 19:43.414
and I saw two guys
on the stairs

19:43.416 --> 19:45.816
and one of them said,
"Come on, she's there.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.285
Let's go, let's go."

19:47.287 --> 19:48.853
That could have meant
anything

19:48.854 --> 19:50.420
and you can't be sure who,
'cause it was dark.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.789
I'm sure, Stuart.

19:51.791 --> 19:56.227
One of them was
Joel Holder.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.230
Yeah? Well, it's a mistake,
or it's a lie.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.966
Hey, look, it couldn't
have been me, all right?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.834
I'm sure it is
a mistake, Joel.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.236
Why don't you clear it up?

20:05.238 --> 20:07.505
Yeah, just get
a blood test.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.974
It will show that you didn't
have sex with the girl.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.843
Okay... okay, all right.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.312
No problem.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.580
We got a deal.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.981
When?

20:16.983 --> 20:20.451
(<i> music blasting</i> )

20:20.453 --> 20:21.452
They say

20:21.454 --> 20:24.322
somebody saw me upstairs.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.456
No way.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.458
We were with him
all night.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.394
LOGAN:
Oh, yeah?

20:29.395 --> 20:31.329
Well, Joel here is going
to take a blood test,

20:31.331 --> 20:33.264
and we'll get this over with.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.299
Nobody's taking
any blood test.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.803
We're calling our lawyers.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.474
Fine.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.009
They still have witnesses
who say

20:45.011 --> 20:46.877
they never left the first
floor during the party.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.446
Under oath, maybe not.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.580
Holder said he would give blood?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.282
CERRETA:
My guess is he did it,

20:51.284 --> 20:52.917
but he knows
he didn't leave a souvenir.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.319
How good is this Gail Carradine?

20:55.321 --> 20:57.021
The husband
didn't break her.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.357
We got Holder on the third
floor at the right time.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.259
But no Campion.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.327
She believes these guys did it.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.296
My call? Pick them up.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.299
All right, do it.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.954
Holder and Campion.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.922
Back up.

21:31.924 --> 21:35.393
Come on, come
on, let's go.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.927
(<i> inmates hooting</i> )

21:36.929 --> 21:38.496
We want to call
our lawyers.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.864
In a minute.

21:39.866 --> 21:40.931
You can't do this to us.

21:40.933 --> 21:43.968
Oh, sure, we can.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.970
INMATE:
Hey, sweet cheeks.

21:45.972 --> 21:49.340
I see
my girlfriend now.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.042
Take a right.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.079
Okay, gentlemen,

21:55.081 --> 21:56.981
toes on the line.
Got them?

21:56.983 --> 22:00.051
I want pictures of every inch
of their bodies.

22:00.053 --> 22:03.521
I don't want any
police brutality claims here.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.838
Judge, a blood test
at this time seems premature.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.341
We'll present
to the grand jury next week.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.875
Miss Gifford?

22:24.877 --> 22:26.944
My client, Joel Holder,
is perfectly willing

22:26.946 --> 22:28.979
to give a blood sample.

22:28.981 --> 22:32.817
The prosecutor's information
looks good to me, Mr. Gould.

22:32.819 --> 22:33.918
I'm signing this order
for both Holder

22:33.920 --> 22:36.787
and for your client,
Mr. Campion.

22:36.789 --> 22:40.391
The detectives may approve
the transfer to Rikers,

22:40.393 --> 22:43.661
where the defendants
will give blood samples.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.429
Nice work, gentlemen.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.398
Four-probe DNA match
on Campion.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.935
It's not so good on Holder--
two-probe, bad sample.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.804
I forget what that says
about the odds.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.806
We got a witness on Holder.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.808
We're going to need
more than that.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.011
They filed a civil suit
against the girl.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.747
Defamation and slander.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.782
CERRETA:
So what?
Public relations.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.752
No, Ezra Gould is not
that kind of lawyer.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.754
If he goes through
with it...

23:09.756 --> 23:11.489
He has something
exculpatory.

23:11.491 --> 23:16.494
They must know something about
that night that we don't, huh?

23:20.032 --> 23:21.532
You don't know what happened,
I do.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.967
What is the agenda here?

23:22.969 --> 23:25.703
Don't go to the grand jury,
we'll drop the civil suit.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.771
You're asking us
to play blind.

23:26.773 --> 23:27.905
Tell us what you have.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.038
What if it
doesn't force you to drop?

23:29.041 --> 23:30.408
We're not handing you
our case.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.942
Ezra, are we on
the same planet?

23:31.944 --> 23:34.011
We have a DNA match
on your clients.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.746
Proves sex, not rape.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.748
You have zero
on Mr. Holder.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.017
It's a lousy case, and you're
ruining these boys' lives.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.453
No, these boys ruined
Andrea Fermi's life,

23:42.455 --> 23:44.722
and we're trying
to make them pay for it.

23:44.724 --> 23:48.492
The college is concerned
about a trial.

23:48.494 --> 23:49.627
Are they concerned

23:49.629 --> 23:50.995
about their drunken
fraternity boys

23:50.997 --> 23:52.062
raping a girl?

23:52.064 --> 23:53.798
You think the civil suit
is a ploy?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.566
It's a chess game.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.836
There's a pawn on the board
that we don't know.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.038
Where will you go with
the alcohol problem?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.741
She was legally drunk--
no capacity to consent.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.843
Legally drunk to drive,

24:05.845 --> 24:08.813
but appearances
can be deceiving.

24:08.815 --> 24:12.883
I have two shots of gin--
that can roll me into bed.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.618
She has four.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.887
She may look perfectly coherent.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.789
Adam, she passed out
on the street.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.659
Iffy. Did she pass out
in that room?

24:21.661 --> 24:23.678
You don't like this
without sugar?

24:23.679 --> 24:25.696
You know the boys are getting
better press play.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.798
What does that tell you?
They'll get better play
from a jury.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.567
Thank you, Paul.

24:29.569 --> 24:30.901
What do you
want to do?

24:30.903 --> 24:32.636
Forget about the law.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.039
Pretend you're a jury,
and find somebody

24:35.041 --> 24:38.576
who will testify that she
wasn't in any condition

24:38.578 --> 24:40.611
to say yes or no.

24:42.548 --> 24:44.682
Well, it doesn't matter
what happens now.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.650
Nobody's ever
going to believe me.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.653
The civil suit is a problem,
because the only way

24:49.655 --> 24:52.656
it makes sense is
if they have a witness--

24:52.658 --> 24:54.925
someone to convince the jury
that you consented.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.061
I didn't!

24:57.063 --> 24:59.997
Plus whatever they have
in their back pocket.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.700
The front pocket
looks pretty good.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.934
You did know the boys.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.769
Not that well. Not...

25:08.641 --> 25:11.108
I'm tired of feeling
like a slut.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.679
Have you talked to Gary Burnham?

25:15.681 --> 25:16.780
No.

25:16.782 --> 25:18.749
Why?

25:18.751 --> 25:21.752
The police think he's frightened
about something.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.722
Did he... participate
in the rape?

25:24.724 --> 25:27.658
No. I... I don't even think
he was there.

25:27.660 --> 25:28.893
I mean, I didn't see him.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.761
The bartender remembers you.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.631
He says you went upstairs
with a man in a costume.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.032
Something about big ears.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.034
We went through this.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.903
I don't remember.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.905
Think.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.907
Maybe.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.042
I don't know.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.845
Maybe it could have been
a... mouse.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.983
With big, black ears.

25:56.956 --> 26:01.959
Then again, maybe I'm just
imagining that, too.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.829
We've been through this
50 times--

26:05.831 --> 26:07.598
no rabbit costume,
no mouse.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.933
You know, the bartender
said ears.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.801
Andrea said
black ears.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.670
That's a major contribution.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.205
Little Bo Peep, Batman,
Master of the Universe

26:15.207 --> 26:16.707
Abraham Lincoln,
Lee Iacocca...

26:16.709 --> 26:17.808
What?

26:17.810 --> 26:18.943
I don't know;
they're college kids.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.010
Ronald Reagan,
Nancy Reagan,

26:20.012 --> 26:23.147
Wonder Woman,
Snoopy, Spiderman...

26:25.084 --> 26:26.684
Snoopy?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.752
Let me have that card.

26:30.656 --> 26:33.857
Hubble's law
of the critical energy density.

26:33.859 --> 26:35.626
Beautiful, huh?

26:35.628 --> 26:37.695
Little school girl,
white knee socks--

26:37.697 --> 26:39.697
she said she was with you.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.700
She said she felt sick,
had too much to drink,

26:42.702 --> 26:44.702
so I took her
to the bathroom.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.604
You leave her there?

26:46.606 --> 26:48.739
No. I came back down
and had a drink.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.842
I got worried
when she didn't show, so, um...

26:51.844 --> 26:53.844
I have to testify
about this?

26:53.846 --> 26:55.846
You might have to, yes.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.749
Look, I have a lot of work
to do here,

26:58.751 --> 27:01.185
so I really shouldn't
have said anything.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.187
You should have told
the police.

27:03.189 --> 27:06.056
At the time,
I didn't make the connection.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.825
Absentminded physicist?

27:07.827 --> 27:10.661
You don't look
that out of it, Mr. Collins.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.264
I went to look for her.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.267
She came stumbling
out of her room.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.136
Look, these jocks...

27:19.138 --> 27:21.839
I mean, if I testify,
they're going to...

27:21.841 --> 27:24.842
We can always finish
this conversation in court.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.847
Okay, Joel runs out.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.815
He throws his arms
around her

27:31.817 --> 27:34.084
and sort of...
carries her back in.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.753
Joel Holder?

27:35.755 --> 27:39.089
Yeah. Joel Holder.

27:40.926 --> 27:43.193
SCHIFF:
<i> What would you settle for?</i>

27:43.195 --> 27:45.829
If he'll roll on Campion,
rape three.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.765
Maybe toss in menacing.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.833
With the questionable DNA,

27:49.835 --> 27:51.168
rape one is going
to be tough, anyway.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.870
Even with the witnesses.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.373
I hate to roll him, Adam,

27:55.374 --> 27:57.875
but the closer we get to trial,
I'd be happy with anything

27:57.877 --> 27:59.810
before we get hit
with whatever Holder

27:59.812 --> 28:01.779
and Campion's lawyers
have under their hats.

28:01.781 --> 28:04.748
So far, we're basically
shooting blanks.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.850
Set up a meeting
with her tomorrow.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.285
Maybe she'll be ready
to plead him out.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.988
Yeah, I hope so.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.824
Newspapers make their stories
up, just like your defendant.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.693
Rape third degree,
menacing

28:15.695 --> 28:17.027
with a leniency
recommendation.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.195
That could still
mean prison.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.247
Oh, I'm not going
to jail.

28:20.248 --> 28:22.298
If you're convicted, a
jury will send you away
for longer than we do.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.802
Mm-hmm, so you want me to lie,
betray my friend,

28:24.804 --> 28:26.804
and go to jail
for doing this.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.906
A witness saw you dragging her
from the room.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.007
I wasn't dragging her!
Joel.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.241
She was drunk.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.976
I was helping her walk.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.112
Mr. Holder, I assume
Miss Gifford informed you

28:35.114 --> 28:38.816
that rape in the first degree
holds a minimum of eight years.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.285
Stop trying to scare him
with numbers.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.753
He's succeeding.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.021
It wasn't rape.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.323
Joel, not another word.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.792
And if it takes a trial to prove
that we're innocent,

28:48.794 --> 28:51.095
then maybe we have
to go through with it.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.267
We'll talk sexual misconduct.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.737
A misdemeanor
for what happened to her?

28:59.739 --> 29:01.839
You have the wrong century.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.841
And you have the wrong offer.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.843
I feel for Miss Fermi,

29:05.845 --> 29:08.946
but she's putting herself
through this for nothing

29:08.948 --> 29:11.248
and doing it
to my client, too.

29:13.018 --> 29:15.819
Either he's tougher
than he looks,

29:15.821 --> 29:17.855
or he believes what he says.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.791
Let's see what Campion believes.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.226
You can't prove sex
wasn't consensual, Stone.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.661
All you've got
is the girl,

29:23.662 --> 29:25.095
and her memory is as
bad as her morals.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.997
We have a DNA match
on your client,

29:26.999 --> 29:29.800
a witness who puts Miss Fermi
in his room,

29:29.802 --> 29:32.136
and slew of witnesses that say
she was very drunk,

29:32.138 --> 29:33.403
too drunk to consent.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.139
I read the medical charts.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.874
.13 is not that high.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.375
She was a heavy drinker.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.377
Now, you said you had
something to offer?

29:40.379 --> 29:41.845
Rape three

29:41.847 --> 29:44.081
with a recommendation,
plus testimony.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.083
What is he,
a serial killer?

29:46.085 --> 29:48.285
We could just discuss
sexual misconduct, huh?

29:48.287 --> 29:50.888
For Mr. Holder, maybe,
not Mr. Campion.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.356
I can't believe this.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.390
You're destroying my life.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.892
Doesn't anybody
understand that?

29:54.894 --> 29:56.426
We're just talking,
Ted.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.296
My mother hardly gets
out of bed anymore.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.431
My father, who is going broke
to prove I'm innocent

30:01.433 --> 30:03.400
looks at me
like I can't even be his son.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.102
That's enough, Ted.
No, it's not enough!

30:05.104 --> 30:06.970
You're playing with my life
like it's a game.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.139
Rape three, rape one,
sexual misconduct.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.874
It's a joke.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.309
Andrea came
to the party...

30:12.311 --> 30:14.244
Ted, we discussed this.
And I don't want
to wait.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.180
She knew what she wanted,
and she got it.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.948
If you want proof,
talk to her boyfriend,

30:17.950 --> 30:19.283
talk to Gary Burnham.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.285
He set it all up.

30:21.287 --> 30:25.455
I haven't heard
the word "immunity."

30:25.457 --> 30:27.991
This week I forgot
what it means.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.427
And my client
forgot what happened.

30:30.429 --> 30:33.363
If he tells the truth,
and it's accessory,

30:33.365 --> 30:34.998
he won't be charged.

30:37.436 --> 30:43.140
I invited her to the party,
but she knew why...

30:44.476 --> 30:48.879
...to have sex with some
of the fraternity brothers.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.147
With Holder and Campion?

30:50.149 --> 30:51.849
They just happened
to be first.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.250
It could have been anybody.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.118
She just wanted
to have a good time.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.420
She told you this?

30:58.357 --> 31:01.859
I found out...
about all the guys she'd had.

31:01.861 --> 31:04.895
She said it was no big deal.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.263
I got angry.

31:06.265 --> 31:09.233
I said, "You want
to take on the whole house,

31:09.235 --> 31:11.235
I can arrange it."

31:11.237 --> 31:13.871
She laughed,
and said, "Go ahead."

31:13.873 --> 31:15.305
You thought she was serious?

31:15.307 --> 31:16.907
Not at first.

31:16.909 --> 31:19.042
When I called her
about the party,

31:19.044 --> 31:21.178
I said
they were waiting for her.

31:21.180 --> 31:24.181
She said, "They're going to love
my costume

31:24.183 --> 31:26.950
if they like little girls."

31:30.256 --> 31:31.488
I thought she meant it.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.991
I thought she wanted it.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.469
None of it is true?

31:45.471 --> 31:47.905
Okay.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.240
He thought he was the first man
in my life.

31:50.242 --> 31:54.278
And when we fought,
we said stupid things,

31:54.280 --> 31:56.947
but we didn't mean them.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.483
Did you say the boys
would like your costume

31:59.485 --> 32:01.285
if they liked little girls?

32:01.287 --> 32:02.552
It was a joke.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.488
Gary will testify.

32:07.493 --> 32:11.194
So now it's not just my word
against Ted and Joel's

32:11.196 --> 32:13.096
it's against Gary, too?

32:15.467 --> 32:18.502
You don't want to go through
with this.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.974
Do you?

32:27.279 --> 32:30.480
If the boyfriend's convincing,

32:30.482 --> 32:33.550
the jury sees
a premeditated orgy.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.186
We're on a line--
seduction or betrayal.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.088
Juries like
the seduction side.

32:38.090 --> 32:41.692
I had breakfast this morning
at the City Club.

32:41.694 --> 32:44.261
Two bankers sit behind me.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.496
I listened while they
convinced themselves

32:46.498 --> 32:47.597
that she's responsible.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.032
What are we supposed
to do?

32:49.034 --> 32:50.200
Rewrite the entire sexual
history of women

32:50.202 --> 32:51.234
in the courtroom?

32:51.236 --> 32:52.703
The boys think

32:52.705 --> 32:54.638
they did nothing wrong,
and she's vague.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.307
She threatened,
she knew them...

32:57.309 --> 32:59.042
And she didn't consent.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.243
The Supreme Court
in Canada

33:00.245 --> 33:02.212
has allowed
women's sexual histories

33:02.214 --> 33:04.214
to be introduced in rape cases.

33:04.216 --> 33:07.084
Message for you.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.352
Current issue.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.221
<i> Sex Crimes and the Law.</i>

33:11.223 --> 33:14.624
Page 54.

33:14.626 --> 33:17.227
"Recent jury studies
show women need

33:17.229 --> 33:20.230
"to separate themselves
from the victim.

33:20.232 --> 33:23.166
"They need to believe
it could not happen to them.

33:23.168 --> 33:26.770
Therefore, women
do not believe the victim."

33:26.772 --> 33:28.338
This cheers me right up.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.607
We need a jury
of feminists.

33:30.609 --> 33:34.244
You need a witness to get you
past reasonable doubt.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.645
The law says
we don't need corroboration.

33:35.647 --> 33:38.131
Wonderful.

33:38.132 --> 33:40.616
Last time I looked,
Utopia is a small town upstate.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.085
Different zip code

33:42.087 --> 33:44.621
from the Criminal Courts
Building.

33:44.623 --> 33:49.359
Gail Carradine's strong
but she's not strong enough.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.862
Schiff's right.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.364
With Campion and Holder
in ties and blue blazers,

33:54.366 --> 33:56.366
the jury sees
their sons.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.802
They won't see their daughters
in Andrea.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.238
What about Gail's husband?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.507
What about him?

34:03.508 --> 34:05.775
She said he had been
the president of the fraternity.

34:05.778 --> 34:09.246
So?
Fraternity presidents
tend to be straight arrows.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.248
Why not appeal
to his honor?

34:11.250 --> 34:13.383
Why don't you try
prosecuting bad guys.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.185
You know, like criminals.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.120
Ted and Joel
are good guys?

34:19.324 --> 34:21.591
You were on the same
floor at the same time

34:21.593 --> 34:23.260
this rape took place.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.095
I never saw a rape.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.166
You really want
Theta Phi

34:29.168 --> 34:31.368
to be a fraternity of rapists?

34:36.341 --> 34:38.241
I saw Gary in the hall.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.643
He was sitting down.

34:39.645 --> 34:40.644
He was drunk.

34:40.646 --> 34:41.711
He looked like

34:41.713 --> 34:43.380
he was going to cry.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.182
I asked him
what was wrong,

34:45.184 --> 34:48.118
and he said,
"I should have warned her.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.419
She didn't know."

34:53.358 --> 34:55.292
We had a deal;
you can't charge him.

34:55.294 --> 34:57.294
Paul.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.229
"If he tells the truth,
and it's only accessory,

34:59.231 --> 35:01.665
he won't be charged."

35:01.667 --> 35:02.766
You lied, Gary.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.734
It was a mistake.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.403
We have a witness
who talked to you.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.238
You knew Andrea
didn't consent.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.439
You can't get in testimony
against my client.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.740
Hearsay.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.309
Statement
against penal interest

35:12.311 --> 35:13.677
in furtherance
of a conspiracy.

35:13.679 --> 35:14.744
I think we'll get it in.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.146
PAUL:
Try it.

35:16.148 --> 35:18.348
We'll have an indictment
on Mr. Burnham

35:18.350 --> 35:20.183
in 36 hours.

35:22.154 --> 35:24.187
I just want this to end.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.856
It can,
if you cooperate.

35:25.858 --> 35:29.759
PAUL:
A few minutes with my client--
alone?

35:43.142 --> 35:46.343
He'll say
what you want him to.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.478
I can't promise you'll get
a conviction on it.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.314
Sexual abuse,
first degree.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.483
Come on, if anybody deserves
a misdemeanor, he does.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.318
He didn't have sex with her.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.454
Just pimped for those who did.
Sexual abuse two.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.256
You need him.

35:59.258 --> 36:02.492
He's your best hope.

36:12.171 --> 36:16.306
Ted and Joel told me that
she wasn't worth worrying about,

36:16.308 --> 36:19.442
that they'd prove
the kind of girl she was.

36:19.444 --> 36:22.379
When you entered the room,
what did you see?

36:24.449 --> 36:27.784
Ted was having intercourse
with Andrea.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.420
And did Andrea protest?

36:30.422 --> 36:32.822
At first, she
looked unconscious.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.824
Then she started
to moan.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.426
She tried to sit up,

36:36.428 --> 36:39.262
but Ted pushed her
back down.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.398
His shirt fell over
on her face.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.401
Was that to prevent her from
seeing who was assaulting her?

36:44.403 --> 36:46.303
Objection.
Calls for a conclusion.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.404
Sustained.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.507
How long were you
in the room?

36:50.509 --> 36:55.412
When Ted finished,
Joel undressed.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.447
He got on top
of her.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.449
It sounded
like she was crying.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.850
Joel finished.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.987
Ted motioned to me
that it was my turn.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.789
That's when I left.

37:07.459 --> 37:11.461
Mr. Burnham, do you have
any doubt at all in your mind

37:11.463 --> 37:15.365
that Andrea was not consenting
to have sex with the defendants?

37:15.367 --> 37:17.584
Objection.

37:17.585 --> 37:19.802
He has no knowledge
of anyone's state of mind.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.005
Statement of intent
hearsay exception, Your Honor.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.506
Still conclusionary, Mr. Stone.

37:23.508 --> 37:26.476
Objection sustained.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.812
No further questions.

37:31.316 --> 37:34.351
Mr. Burnham, did you
and the other boys stand around

37:34.353 --> 37:36.987
and say, "Let's get Andrea
to the party and rape her"?

37:36.989 --> 37:38.255
No. We talked

37:38.257 --> 37:40.023
about having sex with her.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.591
Then you thought
she'd be willing?

37:41.593 --> 37:42.959
Isn't that right?

37:42.961 --> 37:44.027
We thought,
I mean, I thought...

37:44.029 --> 37:46.429
If you planned
to have sex with her,

37:46.431 --> 37:48.331
either you assumed
she'd be willing

37:48.333 --> 37:49.332
or she'd have to be raped.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.268
Which is it?

37:54.573 --> 37:56.539
We thought
she wouldn't mind.

37:56.541 --> 37:58.541
Wouldn't mind having intercourse
with your two friends?

37:58.543 --> 38:01.444
Why would you think that,
Mr. Burnham?

38:03.015 --> 38:05.382
I guess because
of her reputation.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.484
Objection.
Miss Fermi is not on trial here.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.485
Sustained.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.453
Let me ask the witness
directly.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.889
Did you believe
she wouldn't mind

38:12.891 --> 38:14.924
because she told you
she wouldn't?

38:14.926 --> 38:16.926
I misunderstood her. I...

38:16.928 --> 38:21.031
There was no misunderstanding
in your pretrial statement.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.499
Are these your words?

38:22.501 --> 38:24.834
"I said, 'if you want
to take on the whole house

38:24.836 --> 38:26.036
"I can arrange it.'

38:26.038 --> 38:27.837
She laughed
and said, 'Go ahead.'"

38:27.839 --> 38:30.373
I said later, I knew
she didn't mean that.

38:30.375 --> 38:33.009
This was after entering
into a plea bargain agreement

38:33.011 --> 38:35.445
with the district attorney's
office?

38:37.349 --> 38:40.016
I was sorry for what happened--

38:40.018 --> 38:43.586
for having lied,
for having hurt Andrea.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.522
I loved her.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.457
Just one more question.

38:47.459 --> 38:50.493
If you thought
she was being raped,

38:50.495 --> 38:53.363
why didn't you try to stop it?

38:57.035 --> 38:58.368
I don't know.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.904
Ted and Joel were my friends.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.045
I don't know.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.117
No more questions, Your Honor.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.985
Redirect, Your Honor?

39:15.987 --> 39:17.654
JUDGE:
Briefly, Mr. Stone.

39:17.656 --> 39:21.491
Mr. Burnham, the night
of the party, did Andrea

39:21.493 --> 39:24.127
do or say anything to you

39:24.129 --> 39:26.062
to indicate
that she wanted to have sex

39:26.064 --> 39:27.364
with the defendants?

39:27.366 --> 39:29.532
No.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.034
Never.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.504
Thank you.

39:35.474 --> 39:40.009
I had been drinking
for maybe an hour.

39:40.011 --> 39:43.480
Do you recall entering
the defendant's room?

39:43.482 --> 39:45.014
It's all hazy.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.151
I remember
sitting next to Ted

39:48.153 --> 39:51.087
on the couch,

39:51.088 --> 39:54.022
and he held a bottle of Scotch
up to my mouth.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.158
Do you remember

39:55.160 --> 39:57.494
being forced
to have intercourse?

39:57.496 --> 39:59.162
Just in flashes.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.030
I'd blacked out.

40:01.032 --> 40:07.036
I remember trying
to leave the room once,

40:07.038 --> 40:09.606
and somebody
pulled me back in.

40:11.643 --> 40:14.043
And the room was dark,

40:14.045 --> 40:18.648
and I was on the floor,

40:18.650 --> 40:20.984
and it was happening.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.486
What was happening, Miss Fermi?

40:27.659 --> 40:30.727
Somebody on top of me...

40:34.099 --> 40:37.434
...inside me.

40:37.436 --> 40:41.137
And then, somebody else.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.008
And I tried to push them off.

40:45.010 --> 40:48.144
I said, "Please, no,"

40:48.146 --> 40:52.482
but they wouldn't stop.

40:52.484 --> 40:57.554
And something fell over my face,
and I couldn't breathe.

40:57.556 --> 41:00.623
And I passed out.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.525
Thank you.

41:02.527 --> 41:04.661
No further questions.

41:04.663 --> 41:08.164
Miss Fermi, we've heard
testimony that you consumed

41:08.166 --> 41:09.833
seven to ten ounces of alcohol.

41:09.835 --> 41:12.202
Have you ever had that much
before in an evening?

41:12.204 --> 41:13.570
Yes.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.538
Can you normally walk
and talk clearly

41:15.540 --> 41:17.574
when you've consumed
that much liquor?

41:17.576 --> 41:19.476
I passed out that night.

41:19.478 --> 41:20.710
So between the time

41:20.712 --> 41:23.813
that you had a normal moment
with the defendants

41:23.815 --> 41:26.249
and the time
you regained consciousness,

41:26.251 --> 41:28.751
you can't really say
what happened, can you?

41:28.753 --> 41:31.187
I've already said
what I can remember.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.857
Isn't it possible you indicated
a desire to have sex

41:33.859 --> 41:35.258
with the defendants?

41:35.260 --> 41:37.527
I hardly knew them,

41:37.529 --> 41:41.064
and what I knew of them,
I did not like.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.131
Can you swear

41:42.133 --> 41:44.067
that in the interim between

41:44.069 --> 41:46.202
their perfectly acceptable
behavior of the defendants

41:46.204 --> 41:49.205
and the time you claim
to have been assaulted,

41:49.207 --> 41:52.275
you gave no indication that
you would have sex with them?

41:52.277 --> 41:54.143
I told you, I didn't know...

41:54.145 --> 41:55.278
Yes or no,
Miss Fermi.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.547
Can you swear to it?

41:58.817 --> 42:02.051
I cannot believe
that I would have done that.

42:02.053 --> 42:03.520
Isn't it possible

42:03.522 --> 42:05.755
you might have forgotten
you consented,

42:05.757 --> 42:09.559
and in a moment of panic,
thought you were being raped?

42:09.561 --> 42:12.595
If you think

42:12.597 --> 42:16.533
that a woman doesn't know
when she's being raped,

42:16.535 --> 42:20.570
I hope you never find out
how wrong you are.

42:26.244 --> 42:27.644
She was well-prepped.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.245
At least you're still
in the ring.

42:29.247 --> 42:32.549
She was good; she could have
been turned against herself.

42:32.551 --> 42:34.367
She's about to be.

42:34.368 --> 42:36.184
Andrea slept with someone else
the night before the party--

42:36.187 --> 42:38.187
an old boyfriend.

42:38.189 --> 42:40.657
They call him tomorrow.

42:40.659 --> 42:42.325
Son of a bitch.

42:42.327 --> 42:45.094
Our engaged victim.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.330
That's the trump card.

42:47.332 --> 42:49.232
Call her,
I want to see her.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.301
I want to see her now.

42:54.105 --> 42:56.105
How could they have found out
about that?

42:56.107 --> 42:57.807
They have investigators, too.

42:57.809 --> 43:01.578
You realize you've put
this entire case in jeopardy?

43:01.580 --> 43:02.845
If you had told us,

43:02.847 --> 43:04.280
we may have been able
to work around it.

43:04.282 --> 43:05.315
FERMI:
He was lonely.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.817
He wanted me back.

43:07.819 --> 43:10.620
He told me how beautiful I was.

43:16.361 --> 43:17.860
I let him kiss me.

43:17.862 --> 43:21.130
It just happened.

43:21.132 --> 43:22.365
You always said

43:22.367 --> 43:24.834
that prior sexual experience
wasn't relevant.

43:24.836 --> 43:27.370
It was the night before,
for God's sake.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.839
In the jury's mind,
it bears directly

43:29.841 --> 43:31.975
on your attitude
toward casual sex.

43:31.977 --> 43:35.211
You testified that you thought
you were engaged.

43:35.213 --> 43:38.314
But it doesn't change the fact
that I was raped.

43:40.285 --> 43:42.852
Or do you think it does?

43:46.791 --> 43:49.258
What I don't
understand

43:49.260 --> 43:52.328
is why were only two types
of semen present?

43:52.330 --> 43:54.397
It's viable for 24 hours.

43:54.399 --> 43:58.401
Because Jimmy and I
used a condom.

43:58.403 --> 43:59.936
I always do.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.806
No exceptions?

44:03.808 --> 44:06.242
Never.

44:08.913 --> 44:11.314
MAN:
Mr. Hollis,
you knew about this case.

44:11.316 --> 44:14.684
Why didn't you contact either
the defense or the prosecution?

44:14.686 --> 44:17.253
Why would I? It had nothing
to do with the rape.

44:17.255 --> 44:18.888
<i> Alleged</i> rape.

44:19.891 --> 44:21.758
Right.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.427
Then I talked to the man
in your office,

44:24.429 --> 44:27.930
and I guess I realized
I didn't have any choice.

44:27.932 --> 44:29.432
Thank you.

44:29.434 --> 44:31.401
No more questions.

44:31.403 --> 44:33.436
Mr. Hollis, you testified

44:33.438 --> 44:36.873
that this was an impulsive act
on both your parts?

44:36.875 --> 44:38.875
It happened
pretty quick, yes.

44:38.877 --> 44:40.410
Was any precaution taken

44:40.412 --> 44:43.312
against disease transmission
or pregnancy?

44:43.314 --> 44:45.415
We used a condom.

44:45.417 --> 44:47.450
So despite the passion
of the moment,

44:47.452 --> 44:48.918
you still took the time?

44:48.920 --> 44:51.254
She insisted. She always did.

44:51.256 --> 44:52.455
Always?

44:52.457 --> 44:55.458
Yeah. Always.

44:55.460 --> 44:56.793
Thank you.

44:56.795 --> 44:59.028
Your Honor,
People would like

44:59.030 --> 45:01.330
to recall a previous witness.

45:01.332 --> 45:04.000
Andrea always demanded
that we use them.

45:04.002 --> 45:06.653
She was fanatical
about it.

45:06.654 --> 45:09.305
So if she were voluntarily
having sex with someone,

45:09.307 --> 45:11.441
it would not be unprotected?

45:11.443 --> 45:14.010
Objection. Calls
for a conclusion.

45:14.012 --> 45:16.012
Then, I'll rephrase
the question.

45:16.014 --> 45:18.881
Mr. Burnham, in your
relationship with Miss Fermi,

45:18.883 --> 45:21.451
who purchased the prophylactics?

45:21.453 --> 45:23.403
I usually had them.

45:23.404 --> 45:25.354
If I didn't, she always
kept one in her purse.

45:25.356 --> 45:27.390
Thank you.
No further questions.

45:33.398 --> 45:36.332
Concerning the defendant
Joel Holder on charge of rape,

45:36.334 --> 45:39.268
in the first degree,
how does the jury find?

45:39.270 --> 45:41.938
We find the defendant
not guilty.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.740
(<i> observers murmuring</i> )

45:43.742 --> 45:46.375
Concerning the defendant
Theodore Campion

45:46.377 --> 45:48.111
on charge of rape
in the first degree

45:48.113 --> 45:49.345
how does the jury find?

45:49.347 --> 45:52.381
We find the defendant
not guilty.

45:52.383 --> 45:54.450
Yes.

46:07.966 --> 46:11.033
(<i> reporters clamoring</i> )

46:15.373 --> 46:17.073
Miss Fermi!

46:17.075 --> 46:18.541
Just one question.

46:18.543 --> 46:20.009
Just tell me...

46:20.011 --> 46:21.878
will you...

46:23.481 --> 46:26.549
Miss Fermi,
don't do this to yourself.

46:26.551 --> 46:27.950
You did nothing wrong.

46:27.952 --> 46:29.786
They knew what they did to me.

46:29.788 --> 46:31.053
They knew I didn't want them to,

46:31.055 --> 46:32.922
and that jury just told me
that I'm guilty.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.657
And they were wrong.

46:34.658 --> 46:36.391
I went through all of this
for nothing.

46:36.394 --> 46:38.461
It may seem like that
this second,

46:38.463 --> 46:40.463
but this verdict
will outrage people.

46:40.465 --> 46:41.798
The next time...
Great, thank you.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.366
Thank you for the pep talk.

46:43.368 --> 46:46.803
It's nice to know
I performed a public service.

46:46.805 --> 46:48.104
Miss Fermi.

46:48.106 --> 46:49.572
Miss Fermi.

46:49.574 --> 46:52.008
The jury made a mistake,
the system let you down.

46:52.010 --> 46:53.009
I'm sorry.

46:53.011 --> 46:56.479
So am I, Mr. Stone.
