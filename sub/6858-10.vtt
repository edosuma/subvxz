00:17.434 --> 00:19.560
NARRATOR: Conflict with no end in sight!

00:19.602 --> 00:23.147
Across the galaxy,
the quagmire of war continues.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.233
While clone troopers suffer casualties
at alarming rates,

00:26.276 --> 00:28.610
the Galactic Senate
convenes an emergency session

00:28.820 --> 00:31.113
to debate the true cost of the war.

00:31.781 --> 00:36.618
Order! Order! Let Senator Saam finish.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.663
This is a matter not of philosophy.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.290
More troops are needed.

00:41.583 --> 00:45.294
The Republic cannot afford to let
the Separatists gain any more ground.

00:45.503 --> 00:49.298
Our generals inform us that troops
in the field continue to perform valiantly.

00:49.799 --> 00:52.342
What we cannot afford
is to be irresponsible.

00:52.802 --> 00:56.096
The Republic is near bankruptcy
due to the cost of this war.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.891
(SENATORS CLAMORING)

00:59.309 --> 01:02.519
Bankruptcy is not necessary, my friends.

01:02.645 --> 01:06.648
If we pass Senator Saam's bill
to open new lines of credit,

01:06.816 --> 01:09.485
we will gain access to the needed funds.

01:09.819 --> 01:13.113
Won't this bill essentially
deregulate the banks?

01:13.323 --> 01:17.493
A small price to pay to finance the war,
is it not?

01:18.369 --> 01:23.373
-Keep the war going!
-Keep the war going!

01:23.625 --> 01:27.628
Members of the Senate,
do you hear yourselves?

01:27.670 --> 01:29.797
More money. More clones.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.467
More war.
Say nothing of fiscal responsibility,

01:33.718 --> 01:35.511
what about moral responsibility?

01:36.137 --> 01:38.180
Hasn't this war gone on long enough?

01:38.515 --> 01:42.851
Senator Amidala, are you suggesting
we surrender to the Separatists?

01:43.019 --> 01:47.856
Of course not. But negotiation
might be a better course of action.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.026
You can't negotiate with those animals!

01:51.194 --> 01:53.821
Keep the war going! Vote now!

01:53.905 --> 01:56.281
(SENATORS CHANTING IN AGREEMENT)

01:57.659 --> 02:02.704
Members of the Senate,
I suggest we table any emergency bill

02:02.747 --> 02:05.749
until it is determined
whether or not deregulation

02:05.875 --> 02:07.835
is the right course of action.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.089
Very well.
We shall let calmer heads prevail.

02:19.055 --> 02:22.266
That legislation would have meant
billions for us.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.852
I tried my best to push the bill through.

02:25.186 --> 02:30.274
You did your part, Representative.
Senator Amidala is the problem.

02:30.567 --> 02:34.069
I thought age might temper her idealism.

02:34.612 --> 02:38.073
I know people
who could do something about her.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.535
That task is more difficult
than you presume.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.413
Gentlemen, the Banking Clan
and Trade Federation

02:44.539 --> 02:47.249
are about business, not violence.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.837
Hmm. In this case, our business is violence.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.215
Precisely.
With or without Senator Amidala,

02:55.258 --> 02:59.595
the Galactic Senate is unlikely
to deregulate the banks

02:59.929 --> 03:01.889
until this war hits home.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.766
What exactly are you proposing?

03:06.811 --> 03:11.940
Perhaps some unexpected bloodshed
on Coruscant may change a few minds.

03:12.483 --> 03:17.237
Coruscant? Coruscant has not been
attacked in over 1,000 years.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.115
Then it has a false sense of security.

03:20.491 --> 03:23.994
There are some powerful clients
on the other side who could help us,

03:25.288 --> 03:27.789
shall we say, make the point.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.459
I like this plan.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.461
No one cares what you think.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.510
You must ask the Jedi Council
to speak with Chancellor Palpatine.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.012
Don't involve me in this.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.807
A peaceful solution
is the only way out of this morass of war.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.809
That's not my role, Padmé.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.146
Why not? Why isn't it your role?

03:51.439 --> 03:52.648
Aren't we Jedi Knights?

03:52.857 --> 03:56.193
Isn't it our duty to speak our minds
to advise the Chancellor?

03:56.444 --> 03:57.653
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh...

03:57.695 --> 04:01.615
I'd suggest you teach my young Padawan
a thing or two about politics.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.660
After today's debate, I was hoping
she learned a great deal.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.163
Truthfully? I don't understand any of it.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.831
I know the Separatists are evil,

04:09.874 --> 04:12.876
but all anyone argued about
was banking deregulation,

04:13.002 --> 04:15.003
interest rates and, well,

04:15.046 --> 04:17.881
almost nothing about why
we're fighting in the first place.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.385
War's complicated, Ahsoka,
but let me simplify it.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.054
The Separatists
believe the Republic is corrupt,

04:24.180 --> 04:26.848
but they're wrong,
and we have to restore order.

04:27.475 --> 04:31.395
Maybe talking to the Jedi Council
isn't the role for you, after all.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.064
Thanks for your help. Come on, Ahsoka.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.192
Hey.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.194
PADMÉ: You told me to teach her
about politics.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.238
So I'm going to.

04:46.869 --> 04:50.706
There is a problematic situation
brewing in the Senate.

04:50.957 --> 04:54.084
We must ensure that everything
my master has set in motion

04:54.210 --> 04:55.877
does not unhinge.

04:56.045 --> 05:00.215
My representatives in the Republic
are relying on you, General.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.302
See that your droids
complete their mission.

05:03.553 --> 05:07.806
But, of course, Count. They will not fail.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.187
(SIGHS) If only I could talk
to Senator Bonteri.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.148
-Who's he?
-He is a she.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.609
A senator in the Confederacy
of Independent Systems.

05:20.445 --> 05:24.072
Your friend is a Separatist?
One of Dooku's pawns?

05:24.407 --> 05:26.908
The Separatists used to be a part
of the Republic.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.328
I was close
with many of the senators who left.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.914
I may not agree with them,
but they're more than pawns.

05:33.082 --> 05:36.335
If you think negotiating
is the right thing to do, let's talk to her.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.503
The Senate's made it illegal.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.796
Illegal?

05:39.922 --> 05:43.675
They say official meetings would
only legitimize the Separatists.

05:43.968 --> 05:48.180
Well, Master Skywalker and I hold
what we call "aggressive negotiations"

05:48.264 --> 05:49.431
all the time.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.684
It's a shame you can't hold
more peaceful talks when you want.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.145
You just gave me an idea.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.607
You're a Jedi,
which gives you special clearance.

05:58.941 --> 05:59.983
Right.

06:00.151 --> 06:03.528
And Jedi are allowed to travel
to neutral worlds, like Mandalore,

06:04.030 --> 06:07.824
where we could then board a cargo ship
to a Separatist system.

06:08.284 --> 06:12.120
Are you suggesting
I use my status as a Jedi

06:12.205 --> 06:14.790
to smuggle you behind enemy lines?

06:14.957 --> 06:17.918
It's just that you could get us
through to meet with her,

06:18.002 --> 06:20.587
and I haven't seen her,
or her family, in so long.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.131
Relax, I'll help you.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.343
Besides, Master Skywalker said
you should teach me about politics.

06:26.844 --> 06:27.928
Right.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.764
You know, you two have more in
common than you think.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.808
It's no wonder you get along so well.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.518
Huh. Of course.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.813
-So, where are we heading?
-Raxus.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.068
DOOKU: Have all the preparations
been made?

06:43.152 --> 06:45.946
I am about to deploy the infiltrators.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.532
You must hurry, the Senate is restless.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.828
I don't take orders from you,
only Count Dooku.

06:57.333 --> 07:03.505
You have been designed for this mission
to be the ultimate infiltration units.

07:03.881 --> 07:09.386
Some of you may not return.
Actually, none of you will return.

07:09.846 --> 07:14.015
But don't let that get in your way.
Is that clear?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.892
(DISTORTED CHATTERING)

07:24.694 --> 07:26.653
Get them to Coruscant.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.913
Excuse me, is this Platform B?

08:18.372 --> 08:20.749
-Platform B is the next one, ma'am.
-This way.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.459
Oh, thank you.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.922
Hello, old friend.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.050
Ahsoka, this is Mina Bonteri.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.928
She was my mentor
when I was growing up on Naboo.

08:33.262 --> 08:35.096
You're a Separatist?

08:35.264 --> 08:38.141
Well, of course, my dear.
What were you expecting?

08:38.392 --> 08:40.435
Now, come, I have a transport waiting.

08:56.118 --> 08:59.746
Lux, come down here and help
our guests with their luggage, please.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.964
Padmé, it's so good to see you.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.717
Yes, how things have changed
since the last time we met.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.262
Let's go inside. There's much to discuss.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.972
Please, allow me.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.434
-May I?
-I can handle it.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.571
He's grown so much, Mina.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.657
Time won't stop, even if we are at war,

09:36.450 --> 09:39.953
and I'm afraid these events
are shaping his young life.

09:40.329 --> 09:44.666
With all due respect, as a Separatist,
didn't you create this war?

09:45.167 --> 09:47.002
-Ahsoka!
-It's all right.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.505
That's a very polarized point of view,
my dear.

09:50.923 --> 09:55.093
Would it surprise you to know that
many of the people you call Separatists

09:55.177 --> 09:58.346
feel the same way about the Republic?
And the Jedi?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.016
Lux's father was like that.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.269
Maybe I could speak with him.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.187
If only you could.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.024
A year ago next week.

10:09.942 --> 10:13.194
He was setting up a base on Aargonar
when clones attacked.

10:14.030 --> 10:18.867
My husband fought bravely in self-defense,
but was killed.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.873
Excuse me, I think I'll get some air.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.889
Ah, the cleaning droids. Finally!

10:41.390 --> 10:42.932
Don't waste any time, get to work!

11:00.910 --> 11:02.285
You're a Jedi, aren't you?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.704
Yes, why do you ask?

11:05.456 --> 11:08.083
Before the war,
I was always told Jedi were good.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.210
And now?

11:11.712 --> 11:13.505
I don't know anymore.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.340
There are a lot
of terrible things happening.

11:15.716 --> 11:19.969
A lot of killing. And now my friends
are saying the Jedi are to blame.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.098
I'm the first Jedi you've ever met,
aren't I?

11:23.766 --> 11:24.808
Well...

11:26.268 --> 11:27.310
Yes.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.979
Look at me. I'm not so bad, am I?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.071
No, not bad at all.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.280
(GROANS)

11:39.365 --> 11:43.410
Well, it seems boys are the same
whether they're Republic or Separatist.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.495
Wait!

11:46.330 --> 11:47.914
How many Separatists have you met?

11:47.998 --> 11:49.082
What?

11:49.250 --> 11:51.418
Well, I mean, you think we're all
the bad guys,

11:51.502 --> 11:54.129
but how many of us
have you actually met?

11:54.255 --> 11:55.714
And droids don't count.

11:56.340 --> 12:01.720
Well, other than military officers,
like Grievous and Ventress, none, I guess.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.763
You and your mother are the first.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.058
Well, look at me. Am I so bad?

12:10.062 --> 12:12.647
I sense Dooku's dirty hand in all of this.

12:13.107 --> 12:17.193
He's just the leader of the Senate.
He's not the leader of the entire universe.

12:17.361 --> 12:21.656
Oh, I forgot. You actually admire the man.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.577
We'll never entirely agree on Dooku,
my old friend.

12:26.078 --> 12:30.457
But we can agree on the need
to stop this war, the question is how.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.501
That is why it was so urgent
that I speak with you.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.670
The Republic Senate
is holding a critical vote

12:35.755 --> 12:38.006
on whether or not to escalate
the war effort.

12:38.632 --> 12:42.218
However, many of the delegates
are undecided as to what to do.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.137
How interesting.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.099
You would find the Separatist Parliament
in a similar dilemma.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.019
I am certain if you could convince
your representatives

12:51.103 --> 12:53.980
to extend an olive branch of peace
towards the Republic,

12:54.064 --> 12:57.984
there might be enough sympathy
in the Senate to finally open negotiations.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.403
I admire your spirit, Padmé.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.406
I can at least put the motion on the floor.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.576
Thank you, Mina, that's all I ask.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.163
To peace, then.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.793
To hope.

your worries are gravely exaggerated.

this groundswell of peace won't continue?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.814
Well, this is goodbye.

14:59.857 --> 15:05.445
I've been disappointed before,
and yet I almost feel as if, this time,

15:05.487 --> 15:09.490
the tide has turned in the war.
You should hurry.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.785
Goodbye, young one.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.789
You really believe the Republic
will vote for peace?

15:17.166 --> 15:21.002
I hope so. I wouldn't want to meet you
on the battlefield.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.670
For your sake.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.342
Go, you two. Quickly.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.526
Team leaders, come in. (COUGHING)

15:45.611 --> 15:47.403
Commence Phase 2.

15:47.863 --> 15:51.324
Proceed with high-security infiltration.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.035
(CHATTERING IN AGREEMENT)

16:08.801 --> 16:11.219
All right, everybody have your passes out.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.193
Hmm. Generator maintenance, eh?

16:27.236 --> 16:28.319
Hmm.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.739
Well, everything checks out,
good luck down there.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.122
Whoa! Wait a minute!

16:41.417 --> 16:42.875
(DISTORTED CHATTERING)

16:43.127 --> 16:45.420
Power generators are that way.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.300
(CHUCKLES) Stupid droids.

16:55.389 --> 16:59.183
Well, well, well.
This is quite a stunning development.

16:59.601 --> 17:03.438
Your Excellency, we would be remiss,
if not irresponsible,

17:03.522 --> 17:07.316
-to reject the Separatists' proposal.
-Of course.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.735
An end to the fighting

17:08.819 --> 17:11.738
would mean there's no need
to borrow money for more clones.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.490
I can see why
you would want so badly to believe

17:14.575 --> 17:17.493
that the Separatists desire peace.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.328
I don't understand.

17:19.413 --> 17:23.124
In the past, whenever we've reached out
our hands in peace,

17:23.208 --> 17:25.668
they've been slapped away.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.589
Can we believe that they're ready to sue
for peace so easily?

17:30.466 --> 17:35.428
If I might speak with you confidentially.
I know that this is sincere.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.639
I've been in contact
with my old friend Mina Bonteri,

17:38.724 --> 17:41.100
and the origin of the proposal is with her.

17:41.185 --> 17:45.188
Bonteri?
How was the dialogue established?

17:45.272 --> 17:49.275
Does it matter, Chancellor,
if the result is an end to the war?

17:49.359 --> 17:51.986
I see your point, my child.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.947
Then, we shall put the vote to the floor.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.884
Sweeper droids?
We didn't schedule a cleaning.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.352
(GROANS)

18:28.774 --> 18:30.441
What's going on?

18:48.710 --> 18:52.421
Given that the Separatists have
put a call for negotiations on the table,

18:52.548 --> 18:55.508
the need for additional troops
seems ill-timed.

18:55.551 --> 18:59.345
Which means there is no need
to deregulate the banks.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.265
I say we vote that down now.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.073
There is a move to vote
on the proposed bill

19:19.199 --> 19:22.076
to lift regulations on the Banking Clan.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.912
Dooku promised he would stop this vote!

19:27.249 --> 19:29.125
You may enter your votes.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.808
(ALL MURMURING)

19:54.902 --> 19:56.736
We're under attack!

20:03.327 --> 20:04.869
(ALL SCREAMING)

20:12.294 --> 20:17.423
The bombing of the power generator
has been confirmed as a Separatist attack.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.675
They must pay for what they have done.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.762
But it was the Separatist Congress
that issued the bill of peace.

20:23.138 --> 20:27.308
Obviously a tactic to lower our defenses
and launch this attack.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.810
No! That's not true!

20:29.937 --> 20:34.273
I move to immediately
deregulate the banks.

20:34.691 --> 20:38.486
We need a bank loan
to get more troops now!

20:38.612 --> 20:40.488
What are we waiting for?

20:42.991 --> 20:46.494
I'm afraid we've been given little choice.

20:46.536 --> 20:51.666
To ensure the safety of the Republic,
we must deregulate the banks.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.478
I'm returning your Padawan.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.189
I'm sorry your talks with Bonteri failed.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.732
How did you know?

21:16.858 --> 21:19.193
We have eyes and ears
everywhere, Ahsoka.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.862
That was dangerous and careless
going to Raxus.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.408
Not to mention illegal.
You went too far this time.

21:27.035 --> 21:30.579
You would do the same.
You do the same all the time.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.832
This was too much.

21:32.874 --> 21:37.420
Maybe so, but I did realize something,
the politics of this war

21:37.546 --> 21:41.257
are not as black and white
as I once thought they were.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.595
