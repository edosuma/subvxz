I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS. WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:55.260 --> 00:57.260
HE'S YOUR FATHER,
YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHERE HE IS.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.680
WHO'S HE ACCUSED
OF MURDERING?

00:58.720 --> 01:02.140
HIS FORMER PARTNER,
REECE, AND AN OLD
POLICE INFORMANT,

YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.850
I NEED YOUR HELP.

01:41.890 --> 01:44.020
LOOK, YES, WE ALL KNOW
YOU'RE A BED-WETTER

01:44.060 --> 01:46.140
OCCASIONALLY, DES, SO WHAT?

01:46.190 --> 01:49.150
LISTEN. HAVE YOU SEEN
MY FATHER, OKAY?

01:49.190 --> 01:51.770
BECAUSE THE COPS ARE HERE
LOOKING FOR HIM.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.740
RIGHT. I'M TEXTING
YOU AN ADDRESS.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.320
MEET ME THERE
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.240
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

01:59.530 --> 02:03.040
SO... YOU THINK
MY FATHER KILLED SOMEONE.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.660
RIGHT. DO YOU
HAVE ANY EVIDENCE,

02:04.700 --> 02:06.960
YOU KNOW, CIRCUMSTANTIAL

02:07.000 --> 02:09.170
JAKE, DON'T EVEN THINK
OF GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.460
I KNOW IT'S YOUR DAD. OKAY?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.630
I DO.

02:14.670 --> 02:16.800
BUT IF HE DID
WHAT WE THINK HE DID,

02:16.840 --> 02:20.550
THERE'S NOTHING YOU OR I OR
ANYONE CAN DO TO HELP HIM.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.140
FINE. YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.270
PLEASE.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.310
COULD HAVE BROUGHT
ME A COFFEE AT LEAST.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.650
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

02:40.030 --> 02:41.570
THE COPS ARE LOOKING
FOR YOU ALL OVER THE PLACE,

02:41.620 --> 02:42.830
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
JUST STANDING THERE?

02:42.870 --> 02:45.950
YOU TOOK A CAB TO MEET
YOUR FUGITIVE FATHER?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.210
WELL, YOU KNOW, ANY MINUTE,
THIS WHOLE CITY'S GOING TO BE
COVERED IN SNOW,

02:49.250 --> 02:51.170
SO I GOT HER LOCKED AWAY
FOR... FOR THE WINTER.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.250
GLAD TO SEE YOU HAVE
YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

02:53.290 --> 02:54.420
&lt;SIGHS&gt; I'M SORRY.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.420
I'M... I'M... I'M SORRY.

02:56.460 --> 02:57.300
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

02:57.340 --> 02:59.720
SONJA, SHE KILLED AN
OLD INFORMANT.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.430
I NEED TO FIND OUT
WHY AND WHY SHE'S
PINNING IT ON ME.

03:02.470 --> 03:05.430
OKAY, BUT I... I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE
DOING HERE.

03:05.470 --> 03:07.480
LOOK, THAT'S HER CAR.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.400
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO
DOUBLE-BACK AND CLEAR IT OUT.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.190
WE NEED TO FIND ANY
KIND OF EVIDENCE.

03:12.230 --> 03:14.270
ANYTHING THAT COULD
PROVE MY INNOCENCE.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.030
ALL RIGHT, I'M ON IT.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.820
&lt;PANTING&gt;

03:24.160 --> 03:26.540
NOT THAT CAR! IDIOT!

03:26.580 --> 03:28.200
OH. I JUST...

03:33.080 --> 03:34.380
&lt;METAL CREAKING&gt;

03:37.300 --> 03:38.420
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

03:38.460 --> 03:39.970
YEAH.

03:44.050 --> 03:46.510
OKAY, I HAVE &lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

03:46.560 --> 03:48.220
SOME GOOD NEWS
AND SOME NOT SO GOOD NEWS.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.390
WHAT DO YOU WANT FIRST?

03:50.440 --> 03:53.020
-GOOD NEWS.
-THE GOOD NEWS IS
YOU'RE SITTING DOWN.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.400
THE BAD NEWS IS
YOU'RE SITTING ON A...
ON A BOMB.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.360
A BOMB.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.400
SONJA SPECIALIZED IN
BOMB DISPOSAL

03:59.440 --> 04:00.490
BACK ON THE FORCE.

04:00.530 --> 04:02.660
OBVIOUSLY SHE PICKED UP
A FEW TIPS.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.330
IF I GOT OUT OF THIS CAR,
THE WHOLE THING COULD BLOW.

04:06.370 --> 04:08.370
WELL, DON'T GET OUT
OF THE CAR, THEN.

04:08.410 --> 04:11.830
BRILLIANT. ANY OTHER WORDS
OF ADVICE, MR. SENSITIVE?

04:11.870 --> 04:14.250
JUST, RELAX, OKAY?

04:14.290 --> 04:16.750
OR TRY TO RELAX. HOLD ON.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.210
NO, JAKE. JAKE, STOP.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.010
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SHE MIGHT HAVE THIS
WHOLE CAR RIGGED!

04:21.050 --> 04:22.510
LOOKS LIKE SHE
LEFT HER LAPTOP.

04:22.550 --> 04:23.720
STOP BEING AN IDIOT!

04:23.760 --> 04:25.640
STOP CALLING ME AN IDIOT!

04:29.180 --> 04:30.350
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU, HERE.

04:30.390 --> 04:32.690
IF YOU'RE TRIGGERING
ANOTHER BOMB IS HELPING ME

04:32.730 --> 04:34.020
THEN STOP HELPING!

04:34.060 --> 04:37.520
DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES.
YOU MIGHT BLOW US BOTH UP.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.030
OKAY, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S...

04:42.070 --> 04:44.570
IT'S TRIGGERED BY...
BY A PRESSURE DEVICE,

04:44.610 --> 04:48.030
SO I'M JUST GOING TO
JAM THIS IN HERE

04:48.080 --> 04:50.700
AND SEE IF I CAN JUST...

04:51.410 --> 04:53.250
ALL RIGHT.

04:53.290 --> 04:54.870
THAT MIGHT HOLD
FOR A FEW SECONDS.

04:55.710 --> 04:59.130
SON. YOU CAN
RUN ALONG, NOW.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.710
I'M SERIOUS.
YOU'VE DONE YOUR PART.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.550
THE REST IS UP TO ME.

05:02.590 --> 05:03.840
-YEAH?
-YEAH.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.510
-MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
-YEAH.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.430
GOOD LUCK.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.350
I'M JOKING.
WHAT ARE YOU, INSANE?

05:15.350 --> 05:17.020
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS
TOGETHER, YOU AND ME.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.150
-READY?
-YEAH.

05:22.190 --> 05:23.360

05:33.080 --> 05:35.080
&lt;HEAVY BREATHING&gt;

05:35.120 --> 05:38.130
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, SHE'S NOT
THAT GREAT AT, UH,

ROSE IS KEEPING AN EYE
OUT AT THE HOUSE.

06:26.630 --> 06:27.680
NO COPS YET, BUT IT CAN ONLY

06:27.720 --> 06:28.930
BE A MATTER OF TIME.

06:31.470 --> 06:34.060
-HUH...
-MOST OF THE FILES
ARE ENCRYPTED.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.430
[JAKE] SHE DIDN'T THINK
WE'D BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.350

WHY? I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG, GEORGE.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.790
NO. SO THAT DOUBLE-CROSS

07:34.830 --> 07:36.450

NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS
TO GET YOUR MIND OFF CRACK.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.610

WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

08:31.300 --> 08:33.630
HMM, DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

08:35.590 --> 08:37.350
[DES] SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH YOUR DAD TODAY?

08:37.390 --> 08:40.390
YOU KNOW, SPEAKING AS
A MAN WHO RECENTLY
REUNITED WITH HIS FATHER,

08:40.430 --> 08:42.770
I CAN GIVE YOU PILES
AND PILES OF ADVICE.

08:42.810 --> 08:45.610
OKAY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT GEORGE IS MY FATHER.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.400
AND RIGHT NOW,
HE'S MORE INTERESTED

08:47.440 --> 08:49.320
IN GETTING HIS MONEY THAN
WHETHER OUR DNA MATCHES.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.940
YOU SHOULD TRY AND BAKE
HIM SOMETHING.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.030
THAT TOTALLY BROKE
THE ICE FOR ME AND MY DAD.

08:53.070 --> 08:54.490
AND IT WAS ALSO
HOW I FOUND OUT

08:54.530 --> 08:55.990
THAT WE BOTH
SHARE A NUT ALLERGY.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.370
WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATE.

08:57.410 --> 08:59.910

FIGURE SOMETHING' ELSE OUT.

09:16.010 --> 09:17.390
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

09:17.430 --> 09:20.640
ME NEITHER. TRUST SOMEONE
LIKE SONJA AND THEN SHE...

09:20.680 --> 09:21.600
OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO GET
THROUGH THIS.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.600

09:30.570 --> 09:32.740
HI THERE.
UH, CAN I HELP YOU?

09:32.780 --> 09:34.530
THERE'S A SEARCH WARRANT
FOR THE PLACE.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.820
AND THERE'S AN
ARREST WARRANT THERE, TOO,
FOR MALACHY DOYLE.

09:36.860 --> 09:37.910
WHY? WHAT DID HE DO?

09:37.950 --> 09:39.830
NOTHING. IT'S ALL
A MISUNDERSTANDING

09:39.870 --> 09:40.990
AND LESLIE KNOWS THIS.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.660
A MISUNDERSTANDING?

09:42.700 --> 09:44.750
I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU COULD
COME TO THAT CONCLUSION

09:44.790 --> 09:45.920
-WITHOUT SPEAKING
TO YOUR HUSBAND.
-&lt;PHONE RINGS&gt;

09:46.920 --> 09:48.670
OH, THIS IS TOO MUCH
FOR ME. I GOTTA GO.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.040
MY DAD'S IN PRISON.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.250
LOOK, IS THIS NECESSARY?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.670
I KNOW
HOW YOU ALL OPERATE.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.510
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO
FIX THIS YOURSELVES,

09:54.550 --> 09:56.260
EVEN THOUGH THAT
IN ITSELF IS A CRIME.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.640
WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.260
WELL, THEN, JAKE JUNIOR,

09:59.300 --> 10:01.970
I'LL EXPECT YOU'LL CALL ME
IF YOUR GRANDFATHER
OR UNCLE

10:02.010 --> 10:03.930
TELL YOU WHERE THEY'RE TO.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.650
IT'S IN MALACHY'S BEST
INTEREST TO TURN
HIMSELF IN. OKAY?

10:07.690 --> 10:09.150
I CAN'T HAVE JAKE AND HIM
RUNNING AROUND,

10:09.190 --> 10:11.690
-TRYING TO SOLVE THIS.
-OKAY.

10:11.730 --> 10:13.480
I'LL TELL HIM THOSE
EXACT WORDS,

10:13.530 --> 10:14.740
IF I HEAR FROM HIM.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.320
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
YOU WILL.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.660
'CAUSE YOU'RE COMING
WITH US.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.160
AND YOU'LL BE NICE
AND CLOSE IF HE CALLS YOU.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.700
[JAKE] THEY WON'T BE LOOKING
FOR THE VAN.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.450
WE SHOULD BE SAFE IN HERE.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.420
ME AND REECE WERE
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO
KNEW ABOUT ACHILLES.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.420
JOHNNY ADLER'S
TRUE IDENTITY.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.590
SO WHAT WAS HE,
SOME KIND OF INFORMANT?

10:31.630 --> 10:33.550
HE WAS AN INVESTMENT
ANALYST FOR THE BANK.

10:33.590 --> 10:36.300
HE USED TO KEEP US IN
THE LOOP WHEN PEOPLE
WERE HIDING MONEY.

10:36.340 --> 10:37.880
AND THAT USUALLY LED US
TO FINDING OUT

10:37.930 --> 10:39.840
WHERE THEY GOT THE COIN
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.050
OH, YEAH.
WHY WAS HE AT THAT?

10:41.100 --> 10:42.930
FOR OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF HIS OWN HEART OR WHAT?

10:42.970 --> 10:44.850
NAH. HE HAD
A WICKED DRUG HABIT.

10:44.890 --> 10:46.100
DIDN'T WANT
TO GO AWAY FOR IT.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.850
DON'T KNOW IF HE STILL
HAD THE HABIT,

10:47.890 --> 10:49.770
BUT, UH, THAT COULD BE
PART OF THIS.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.110
&lt;SIGHS&gt; WHY DID SONJA
WANT HIM DEAD?

10:52.150 --> 10:54.190
GOOD QUESTION.

10:54.230 --> 10:56.280
I PULLED THIS OFF HIM
WHEN I FOUND HIM.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.610
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

10:59.280 --> 11:00.950
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?
I MEAN,
I KNOW THE EMERGENCY.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.030
YOU'RE WANTED
FOR MURDER, MAL.
I MEAN, I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.700
HI. HOW CAN I HELP?

11:04.740 --> 11:08.210
DES, I NEED YOU TO DECRYPT
WHATEVER'S ON THIS COMPUTER.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.000
-YES.
-CHECK OUT THE VOICEMAIL.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.500
-[REECE] IT'S ME.
-IT'S REECE.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.260
I'M CALLING THIS
WHOLE THING OFF.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.920
DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
THINKING. IT'S TOO RISKY.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.800
I'M MEETING TO TELL THE GIRL
I'M WORKING WITH IT'S A NO GO.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.550
DON'T WORRY, YOU'RE SAFE.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.100
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHO YOU ARE

11:25.140 --> 11:26.430
OR WHAT YOUR IDENTITY IS.

11:26.850 --> 11:27.930
LATER.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.770
SONJA WANTED
TO GET TO JOHNNY.

11:29.810 --> 11:31.350
AND AFTER REECE,

11:31.400 --> 11:33.940
OBVIOUSLY SHE KNEW I WAS
THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD
LEAD HER THERE.

11:33.980 --> 11:36.070
-BUT WHAT DID SHE
WANT FROM HIM?
-I DON'T KNOW.

11:36.110 --> 11:37.490
COULD IT BE DRUG RELATED?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.280
JOHNNY WAS IN PRETTY DEEP
IN THE PAST.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.650
-OKAY, GUYS, LOOK...
-&lt;BEEPING&gt;

11:42.570 --> 11:44.280
MAPS OF HARBOUR DRIVE?

11:44.330 --> 11:46.580
[JAKE] THERE'S A BUNCH OF
PHOTOS OF THAT CAR OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

11:46.620 --> 11:50.540
AND THERE'S SOME
TIMES LISTED HERE, TOO.
12:35, 12:45?

11:50.580 --> 11:51.790
THIS IS RESEARCH.

11:51.830 --> 11:53.880
OBVIOUSLY, SHE'S GOING TO
PULL SOME KIND OF JOB

11:53.920 --> 11:55.290
AT HARBOUR DRIVE
WITH THAT CAR.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.750
AT THAT TIME.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.880
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

12:03.010 --> 12:05.930
-CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?
-NO, THANK YOU.

12:05.970 --> 12:08.930
I HAVE TO SAY,
I PREFER THE DECOR
IN YOUR OFFICE.

12:08.970 --> 12:11.440
WE CAN GO THERE
IF YOU WANT, ROSE.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.190
I JUST NEED YOU TO
TELL ME WHERE MAL IS.

12:14.270 --> 12:16.020
I DON'T KNOW.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.860
YOU CAN'T LEGALLY HOLD ME.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.900
I'M NOT THE BAD GUY HERE.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.150
I JUST
WANT TO HELP MALACHY.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.610
I BELIEVE THAT, LESLIE.

12:22.660 --> 12:26.280
I REALLY DO.
BUT I HONESTLY DON'T
KNOW WHERE HE IS.

12:27.030 --> 12:29.040
I KNOW YOU'RE LYING, OKAY?

12:29.080 --> 12:31.500
I KNOW MALACHY WOULDN'T
PUT YOU IN THIS SITUATION

12:31.540 --> 12:33.670
WITHOUT CONTACTING YOU FIRST.

12:33.710 --> 12:36.840
ROSE! JUST REMEMBER,

12:36.880 --> 12:40.130
YOU HELP HIM NOW AND
YOU BECOME AN ACCOMPLICE
AFTER THE FACT.

12:40.170 --> 12:42.840
-WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
-I'M SAYING...

12:42.880 --> 12:44.720
I HOPE
YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH
THAT I NEVER NEED

12:44.760 --> 12:46.510
TO PUT YOU
IN THIS ROOM AGAIN.

12:46.550 --> 12:48.260
I'LL KEEP THAT ON
THE FOREFRONT OF MY MIND.

12:48.850 --> 12:50.020
OKAY?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.270
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME, LESLIE.

12:51.310 --> 12:53.480
I HAVE A HUSBAND WHO'S
AN APPARENT FUGITIVE.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.900
I HAVE A FAMILY TO HELP.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.240
OKAY, SO THIS IS
THE ADDRESS ON THE MAP.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.820
SO, SHE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE HERE NOW. WHY?

13:03.860 --> 13:07.950
OKAY. SONJA WANTED
THE INFORMATION ON
YOUR INFORMANT, RIGHT?

13:07.990 --> 13:09.330
SHE GOES TO REECE.

13:09.370 --> 13:12.080
REECE WON'T GIVE HER
ANYTHING, SONJA KILLS HIM...

13:12.120 --> 13:14.210
AND THEN, SHE CONS ME
TO GET HIS INFO.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.750
KILLS THE INFORMANT.

13:15.790 --> 13:18.420
SHE HAS ALL THESE MAPS
FOR... FOR THIS AREA
RIGHT HERE.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.500
WE KNOW JOHNNY
WAS INTO DRUGS.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.550
MAYBE THIS COULD ALL BE
ABOUT A BIG SHIPMENT HE HEARD
WAS COMING THROUGH.

13:23.590 --> 13:25.930
AND SHE WAS PLANNING TO
HIJACK IT OR WERE THEY
GOING TO BUY IT?

13:25.970 --> 13:29.810
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN
RIGHT NOW.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.020
UH, BOYS...

13:35.440 --> 13:36.850
CHECK OUT THAT CAR.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.690
SAME CAR. WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

13:40.730 --> 13:42.940
SHE'S PROBABLY AFTER
WHATEVER'S IN THAT BAG.

13:44.030 --> 13:45.530
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT.

13:47.740 --> 13:51.040
UM, JAKE, ARE WE
GONNA GET SHOT?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.370
I MEAN, I'M TOTALLY
PREPARED TO, BUT,

13:52.410 --> 13:53.910
I GUESS I'D REALLY
LIKE TO KNOW.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.160
-PLEASE SHUT UP.
-OKAY.

13:56.290 --> 13:58.130
DO ME A FAVOR.
STAY WITH DAD.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.590
DAD, I GOT THIS!

14:01.630 --> 14:03.210
-CAN I HAVE A WORD?
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:03.260 --> 14:04.970
JUST, UH...
JUST A QUICK QUESTION.

14:05.010 --> 14:05.930
I THINK YOU SHOULD...

14:05.970 --> 14:07.430
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

14:12.770 --> 14:14.350
SHOULDN'T THAT
HAVE KILLED ME?

14:14.390 --> 14:15.980
THE WINDSHIELD'S BULLETPROOF.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.150
&lt;GUNSHOTS&gt;

14:18.190 --> 14:19.650
SONJA, STOP THIS!

14:19.690 --> 14:20.900
BACK OFF, MAL!

14:20.940 --> 14:22.400
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

14:24.110 --> 14:25.240
SONJA, GIVE IT UP!

14:25.280 --> 14:26.990
WHY DON'T
YOU STAY OUT OF IT?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.120
[MAL] SHE'S RELOADING!

14:30.160 --> 14:31.410
GET IN!

14:32.030 --> 14:33.370
[JAKE] GO!

14:33.410 --> 14:34.660
&lt;CAR TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

14:40.380 --> 14:42.920
NO, I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,
THE BULLETS, THEY WERE JUST
LIKE BOUNCING OFF THE CAR,

14:42.960 --> 14:44.000
IT WAS CRAZY!

14:44.050 --> 14:45.420
SO THIS IS
A BULLETPROOF CAR?

14:45.460 --> 14:47.550
OH, MY GOD, THE LEGENDS
ARE TRUE.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.930
WHAT THE... WHY ARE THEY
STILL KNOCKED OUT?

14:50.970 --> 14:52.760
I GAVE THEM
A LIGHT SEDATIVE.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.270
[MAL] THIS LOOKS LIKE WHAT
SONJA WAS AFTER.

14:56.310 --> 14:58.020
UGH, IT'S HEAVY.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.190
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

15:09.740 --> 15:11.910
WHOA! THAT'S WAY BETTER
THAN DRUGS.

15:13.030 --> 15:14.910
GOLD. AWESOME.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.580
WE JUST STOLE IT FROM
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.050
SO GO IN AND OUT
THROUGH THE BASEMENT.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.630
I JUST TOLD KATHLEEN
AND CHRISTIAN TO ACT AS
NORMAL AS POSSIBLE.

15:27.670 --> 15:30.300
ACT NORMAL?
WE JUST STOLE
2.2 MILLION DOLLARS

15:30.340 --> 15:32.680
FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
FROM AN ARMORED CAR.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.010
WHAT DID YOU
FIND OUT ANYWAY?

15:34.050 --> 15:35.680
THEY SHIP THE GOLD IN
FROM AROUND THE WORLD

15:35.720 --> 15:37.770
TO VARIOUS PORTS IN
THE COUNTRY. THEN IT GOES
OFF TO THE MINT IN OTTAWA.

15:37.810 --> 15:39.690
THESE SHIPMENTS ARE
USUALLY DONE CLOAK
AND DAGGER STYLE

15:39.730 --> 15:42.020
JUST TO MAKE SURE
NOBODY EVER CATCHES ON.

15:42.060 --> 15:42.980
WE NEED TO GIVE IT BACK.

15:43.020 --> 15:45.440
OKAY. GIVE IT BACK TO WHO?

15:45.480 --> 15:46.980
THERE'S COPS ALL
OVER THE STREET.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.030
YOU SURE YOU SHOULD
BE IN HERE?

15:49.070 --> 15:51.530
LOOK, I WAS A COP.
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'D SUSPECT
I'D HIDE OUT IN MY OWN GARAGE.

15:51.570 --> 15:52.780
HEY, THAT'S CLEVER.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.280
AND, UH, WITH YOUR
RECORD AND HISTORY,

15:54.320 --> 15:56.120
YOU REALLY SHOULD GET
THE HELL AWAY FROM ME.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.790
I AGREE WITH HIM.
YOU SHOULD STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM ALL OF US.

15:58.830 --> 16:01.330
WHAT, AND LEAVE ALL
THIS STUFF FOR YOU GUYS?

16:01.370 --> 16:02.500
FORGET IT.

16:08.380 --> 16:09.630
DES, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

16:09.670 --> 16:12.260
OH, OKAY. WELL,
I PUT SACKS ON THEIR HEADS

16:12.300 --> 16:14.760
AND HEADPHONES IN THEIR EARS.
AND THIS ONE'S LISTENING
TO GOWAN

16:14.800 --> 16:17.180
AND THIS ONE'S LISTENING
TO QUEEN'S GREATEST HITS
ON SHUFFLE.

16:17.220 --> 16:18.640
WHY ARE THEY IN
THEIR UNDERWEAR?

16:18.680 --> 16:20.310
BECAUSE I HAD TO MAKE SURE
THEY WEREN'T CONCEALING
ANY WEAPONS

16:20.350 --> 16:22.060
IN THE LINING OF
THEIR CLOTHING.
THIS IS STANDARD

16:22.100 --> 16:23.350
DETAINMENT PROTOCOL, JAKE.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.520
DES, WE'RE NOT DETAINING
ANYONE, OKAY?

16:25.560 --> 16:28.900
JUST... JUST MAKE SURE
NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM

16:28.940 --> 16:30.360
UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.030
UM, ACTUALLY I'M REALLY
CONCERNED THAT THEY
MIGHT GET COLD.

16:33.070 --> 16:35.870
DO YOU HAVE ANY EXTRA
JOGGING PANTS?

16:35.910 --> 16:38.490
HEY! NEWFOUNDLAND FINANCIAL.
IT'S A BANK.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.330
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE DROP-OFF POINT FOR
THE GOLD TODAY.

16:40.370 --> 16:42.210
THAT'S THE BANK WHERE
JOHNNY ADLER WORKS.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.500
I CAN'T BELIEVE SONJA
SET ME UP
FROM THE BEGINNING.

16:44.540 --> 16:47.170
WELL, SHE WAS USING YOU
TO TRACK DOWN THE INFORMANT
FROM THE BANK.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.170
SO OBVIOUSLY, REECE,
AND JOHNNY, THE INFORMANT,

16:49.210 --> 16:51.590
WERE WORKING TOGETHER.
BUT JOHNNY WAS THE ONLY
PERSON WHO HAD

16:51.630 --> 16:53.880
THE DETAILS ABOUT
HOW THE GOLD WAS
COMING AND GOING.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.180
SO REECE DECIDES TO PULL OUT

16:55.220 --> 16:57.600
AND WON'T GIVE UP
JOHNNY'S IDENTITY TO SONJA.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.060
ALL RIGHT. SHE'S SCREWED,

16:59.100 --> 17:00.180
SO SHE KILLS THEM BOTH...

17:00.220 --> 17:02.020
THEN, SHE PINNED
THE MURDERS ON ME.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.940
I WAS GOOD TO THAT GIRL.

17:03.980 --> 17:05.190
TAUGHT HER
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

17:05.230 --> 17:08.150
WELL, DAD, LUCKILY
YOU CAN'T TEACH THAT
KIND OF CRAZY.

17:08.190 --> 17:09.570
YOU JUST GOTTA BE
BORN WITH IT.

17:09.610 --> 17:11.990
WE NEED TO FIND HER,
YOU GUYS, BEFORE
SHE DISAPPEARS.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.780
CATCHING HER
IS THE ONLY WAY
TO CLEAR YOUR NAME

17:13.820 --> 17:15.780
YEAH, WELL, IF THAT
GOLD IS WHAT SHE WAS AFTER,

17:15.820 --> 17:18.780
I DOUBT SHE'S JUST GONNA
PACK UP AND WALK AWAY.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.160
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

17:22.750 --> 17:23.790
SONJA.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.210
HOW ARE YOU?

17:26.290 --> 17:27.880
DANDY. THANKS FOR ASKING.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.170
I NEED IT, MAL.

17:29.210 --> 17:31.170
WHY DON'T YOU, UH, COME
ON OVER HERE AND GET IT?

17:31.210 --> 17:33.670
[SONJA] WHY DON'T YOU MEET ME
AT OUR LUNCH SPOT?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.220
WE'LL WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER.
I HAVE AN IDEA TO
CLEAR YOUR NAME.

17:36.260 --> 17:38.180
I COULD JUST
CALL THE COPS.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.510
YOU'RE THE WANTED ONE, MAL.

17:40.220 --> 17:42.720
15 MINUTES. MEET ME.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.310
HEY, WE'VE GOT THE GOLD.
WE SHOULD BE CALLING
THE SHOTS.

17:45.350 --> 17:46.850
WE COULD BE THERE
IN 10 MINUTES.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.190
YOU ARE NOT SERIOUSLY
THINKING ABOUT GOING
TO THIS MEET.

17:49.230 --> 17:50.230
NO, NO, IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.940
WE NEED TO GET SOME PROOF
THAT SONJA KILLED REECE.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.190
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.160
&lt;SIGHS&gt; DES, YOU GOTTA LOOK
AFTER THE GUARDS.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.990
TOTALLY! IT'S FEEDING TIME
NOW, ANYWAYS.

17:58.030 --> 18:00.160
OOH, WAIT, WAIT. YOU GOTTA
HIDE THE GOLD FIRST.

18:01.030 --> 18:02.290
OF COURSE.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.120
&lt;CLEARING THROAT&gt;

18:10.170 --> 18:11.500
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

18:14.340 --> 18:15.670
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

18:26.770 --> 18:28.850
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

18:32.020 --> 18:34.360
BENNETT,
HAVE A LOOK-SEE AT THIS.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.360
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

18:35.400 --> 18:37.280
AN ARMORED TRANSPORT
WAS JUST HIJACKED.

18:37.320 --> 18:40.120
A COOL 2.2 MILLION IN
FEDERAL BULLION.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.530
GOLD, NOT THE SOUP CUBES.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.330
PASSER BY SNAPPED
A FAMILIAR FACE

18:44.370 --> 18:46.370
JUST BEFORE
THE ROBBERY HAPPENED.

18:46.410 --> 18:47.830
THAT LOOK LIKE
ANYONE WE KNOW?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.130
JAKE...

18:50.170 --> 18:52.090
&lt;SCOFFS&gt; LIKE FATHER LIKE SON.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.510
I ALREADY TOOK THE LIBERTY OF
HAVING THE WARRANT TYPED UP.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.770
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

19:06.180 --> 19:07.730
&lt;CLANKING&gt;

19:14.190 --> 19:15.610
UH...

19:17.820 --> 19:19.070
[JAKE] HOW YOU DOING?

19:19.110 --> 19:21.280
[SONJA] NO, NO.
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.280
DAD WANTED TO BE HERE,
HE DID.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.290
IT'S JUST THAT I WOULDN'T
LET HIM COME.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.960
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. BYE.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.960
LET'S JUST HAVE A CONVERSATION
LIKE TWO ADULTS. ALL RIGHT?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.250
NOW, WE BOTH KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GET OFF THIS ISLAND

19:33.290 --> 19:35.380
WITHOUT YOUR LITTLE PAYDAY.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.210
SO, I'M JUST GOING TO
THROW THIS OUT THERE.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.800
A NEW IDEA.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.050
-YOU TURN YOURSELF IN.
-YEAH.

19:41.090 --> 19:42.340
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A SOLID PLAN.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.890
I LIKE IT.

19:43.930 --> 19:47.350
YOU MUST HAVE SOME
SERIOUS ISSUES, HUH?

19:47.390 --> 19:49.810
TRYING TO PULL
SOMETHING LIKE THIS OFF.

19:49.850 --> 19:52.270
[SONJA] WHY DON'T WE
TALK ABOUT THE REAL
PROBLEM, HERE.

19:52.310 --> 19:53.560
AND THAT'S THE FACT
THAT YOU JUST STOLE

19:53.610 --> 19:55.020
2.2 MILLION DOLLARS

19:55.070 --> 19:56.780
IN GOLD FROM
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.490
HERE I THOUGHT THE REAL
PROBLEM WAS THE FACT

19:58.530 --> 20:00.740
THAT YOU KEEP KILLING
EVERYONE THAT YOU
WORK WITH.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.410
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

20:02.450 --> 20:03.700
YOU'RE TRYING TO BLAME
MY FATHER

20:03.740 --> 20:05.160
FOR MURDERS
THAT YOU COMMITTED.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.370
NOW TELL ME,
WHAT'S YOUR VICE?

20:07.700 --> 20:09.580
CARDS? PONIES?

20:09.620 --> 20:12.370
GAMBLING? WHAT?
UNLESS KILLING IS YOUR VICE.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.460
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I DON'T THINK THERE'S

20:13.500 --> 20:16.500
A SUPPORT GROUP OUT THERE
THAT CAN HELP YOU.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.760
[SONJA] I HAVE NOTHING TO
DISCUSS WITH YOU.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.470
GET MALACHY.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.880
I WOULD, BUT HE'S A LITTLE
SHAKEN UP

20:21.930 --> 20:23.720
FROM ALMOST
GETTING BLOWN UP
IN YOUR CAR.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.470
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M A LITTLE
SHAKEN UP, TOO.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.930
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO RIG A BOMB LIKE THAT?

20:28.970 --> 20:30.980
WAS IT THE EXPLOSIVE
DISPOSAL UNIT

20:31.020 --> 20:33.230
WITH THE RNC OR
THE FEDS MAYBE?

20:33.980 --> 20:35.150
DO YOU THINK
I'M STUPID?

20:35.190 --> 20:36.730
NO, I THINK
YOU'RE DESPERATE.

20:36.770 --> 20:39.650
WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS
TO ACTING STUPID.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.110
OH, GEE, LOOK AT THAT.

20:42.150 --> 20:44.280
-YEAH, WELL...
-YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.370
-&lt;STATIC&gt;
-WHAT HAPPENED?

20:56.420 --> 20:59.300
[DISTORTED VOICE] NEXT CHAPTER. "SISTER LYDIA

21:06.430 --> 21:09.430

EVERYONE LEAVING ME

21:27.370 --> 21:29.530
KEEP YOU OUT OF
THE LITERAL LINE OF FIRE

22:18.000 --> 22:19.380
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANT?

22:19.420 --> 22:20.500
YEAH.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.420
I MEAN, YOU COULD JUST
ASK YOUR MOM ABOUT IT.

22:23.460 --> 22:25.970
I JUST NEED TO
KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THAT
SKEETY GEORGE LOSER

22:26.010 --> 22:29.550
AND THEN I CAN GO BACK TO
NEVER KNOWING AND NOT CARING.

22:29.590 --> 22:31.890
-YOU CAN DO THAT?
-JUST RUN THE STUPID DNA.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.980

WHAT KIND OF SETBACK?

23:12.140 --> 23:15.310
UH, ONE OF THE GUARDS,
UH, RAN AWAY.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.680
WELL, DES,

23:17.730 --> 23:20.020
YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S ANOTHER
PROBLEM AS IN HE'S GONE.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.690
LIKE, LIKE, AWAY FROM HERE.

23:21.730 --> 23:23.520
OKAY, LOOK. THIS IS
A ONE-TIME OFFER. ALL RIGHT?

23:23.570 --> 23:26.940
YOU CAN TAKE THE GTO
AND GO AND GET HIM.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.150
AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE
THE OFFER AND I DO.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.490
CAN I TAKE A RAIN CHECK?

23:30.530 --> 23:32.160
A WHAT? A RAIN CHECK?

23:32.200 --> 23:33.580
WHAT?

23:34.780 --> 23:36.450
HE TOOK THE GTO.

23:36.490 --> 23:37.660
HE TOOK THE WHAT?

23:37.700 --> 23:39.710
HE TOOK THE GTO AND...
AND THE GOLD

23:39.750 --> 23:42.290
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN
THE TRUNK OF THE GTO
THAT HE TOOK.

23:42.330 --> 23:45.460
DES, STAY THERE. I'M COMING
TO PICK YOU UP NOW.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.470
IF I HAD A CYANIDE PILL,
I WOULD TAKE ONE
RIGHT NOW.

23:55.720 --> 23:56.720
&lt;MUSIC PLAYING&gt;

24:02.350 --> 24:04.190
THE OTHER
DOYLE BROTHER, HUH?

24:05.360 --> 24:07.280
HERE TO MAKE SURE
I KNOW WHO'S BOSS?

24:07.320 --> 24:09.530
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT KATHLEEN'S THE BOSS

24:09.570 --> 24:11.570
OF WHOEVER SHE DEALS WITH.

24:11.610 --> 24:12.910
NO, MAN, I JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE

24:12.950 --> 24:15.240
THAT MY SISTER'S INTERESTS
ARE WELL LOOKED AFTER.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.200
AND, UH, TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I CAN BE OF SERVICE.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.700
YEAH, IF YOU WANT TO
BE OF SERVICE,

24:19.750 --> 24:23.790
POUR ME A DRINK OR TELL
YOUR CRAZY SISTER I WANT
MY MONEY NOW.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.500
OKAY, NORMALLY,
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

24:25.540 --> 24:27.420
IN MY YOUNGER YEARS
I WOULD HAVE BROKEN
YOUR SPLEEN

24:27.460 --> 24:29.970
BY NOW JUST FOR SAYING
HER NAME WITH A HINT
OF AGGRESSION.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.760
IS THAT RIGHT, HUH?
MY SPLEEN. &lt;SCOFFS&gt;

24:31.800 --> 24:35.050
BUT LUCKILY FOR YOU,
I'M GOING THROUGH A BIT
OF A TRANSITION.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.640
CALL IT MY PEACE
KEEPING PHASE.

24:40.850 --> 24:44.270
NOW, ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS TAKE THIS

24:44.310 --> 24:47.150
AND WALK AWAY.
REAL SIMPLE.

24:55.740 --> 24:57.580
THIS IS LIKE HALF OF
WHAT SHE OWES ME.

24:57.620 --> 24:59.540
CUT YOUR LOSSES.

24:59.580 --> 25:01.500
CHALK IT UP TO EXPERIENCE.

25:04.790 --> 25:06.630
I'LL BE BACK FOR
THE REST LATER.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.600
-[DES] THERE IT IS!
-&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

25:35.910 --> 25:37.160
OH...

25:38.740 --> 25:40.790
UH, I JUST... JAKE, I JUST...

25:40.830 --> 25:42.700
-SHUT UP!
-OKAY, I AM SHUTTING UP.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.160
I AM SHUTTING UP. I JUST WANT
YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.670
I'M REALLY, REALLY, REALLY...
I'M SHUTTING UP.

25:53.130 --> 25:54.630
-&lt;JAKE PANTING&gt;
-[DES] ARE YOU OKAY?

25:54.670 --> 25:56.640
JAKE.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.430
-ARE YOU OKAY?
-I... I...

25:59.100 --> 26:01.100
I CAN'T GET... TALK.

26:01.140 --> 26:04.350
OH, LOOK, AND THEY TOOK
THE BUMPER OFF AND EVERYTHING.
THAT'S BURNED.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.600
LET'S JUST SEE

26:07.650 --> 26:09.690
IF THE GOLD
IS STILL IN HERE.

26:11.860 --> 26:14.740
THE TRUNK IS JAMMED.
IT'S JAMMED.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.280
WAIT, LOOK! THERE HE IS!

26:17.410 --> 26:18.660
GO.

26:19.820 --> 26:20.780
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

26:22.620 --> 26:23.620
&lt;YELLS&gt;

26:26.250 --> 26:27.790
-DES, PICK HIM UP.
-OKAY.

26:27.830 --> 26:29.790
HEY! NO, NO, NO.

26:29.830 --> 26:31.040
COME ON! COME ON.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.800
JUST KNOCK IT OFF,
ALL RIGHT?

26:32.840 --> 26:34.670
I AM HAVING
A REALLY BAD DAY.

26:34.710 --> 26:36.300
SO DON'T MAKE IT ANY WORSE.

26:36.340 --> 26:38.340
WHAT DO YOU WANT ANYWAY?

26:38.390 --> 26:40.720
DES, DO NOT LOSE
HIM AGAIN.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.720
I WON'T.

26:43.680 --> 26:47.020
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

26:47.640 --> 26:48.850
NO!

26:52.820 --> 26:54.860
OH, MAN,
THEY TOWED THE GTO.

26:58.780 --> 27:01.530
[DES] SO I THOUGHT THAT THE...
THE GOLD WOULD BE SAFEST

27:01.570 --> 27:02.740
TO PUT IT IN THE TRUNK
OF THE GTO.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.660
BUT THEN ARTHUR,
HE GOT AWAY BACK THERE.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.620
WHICH WAS REALLY
DISAPPOINTING!

27:06.660 --> 27:08.040
'CAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE
MAKING SOME INROADS

27:08.080 --> 27:09.830
IN OUR CAPTOR-CAPTIVE
RELATIONSHIP.

27:09.870 --> 27:12.170
YOU'RE JUST LUCKY THAT HE
DIDN'T RUN TO THE COPS.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.920
WAIT A MINUTE.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.720
WHY DIDN'T YOU RUN
TO THE COPS?

27:21.010 --> 27:24.640
LOOK, JUST LET ME GO.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.310
I PROMISE I WON'T SAY
ANYTHING TO ANYONE.

27:26.350 --> 27:27.810
JUST KEEP HIM
AWAY FROM ME.

27:27.850 --> 27:31.520
WHERE WERE YOU HEADED IN
YOUR, UH, LONG JOHNS
THERE, BUDDY?

27:31.560 --> 27:34.730
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I BET IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

27:34.770 --> 27:36.440
YEAH, I FOUND IT
IN HIS POCKET.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.820
"12:35. TRUNK UNLOCKED.
WAREHOUSE."

27:40.410 --> 27:42.280
THIS IS A CHEAT SHEET,
ISN'T IT?

27:42.320 --> 27:44.830
YOU WERE WORKING
WITH SONJA TO STEAL
THAT GOLD, WEREN'T YOU?

27:44.870 --> 27:46.790
I... &lt;STUTTERING&gt;

27:48.500 --> 27:50.120
YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT. SO...

27:50.170 --> 27:51.750
LOOK, MAN,
YOU CAN TALK TO US

27:51.790 --> 27:53.500
OR WE CAN ALL GO
TALK TO THE COPS.

27:53.540 --> 27:55.920
-IT'S UP TO YOU.
-OH, YEAH, YEAH, DO IT.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.260
TURN ME IN. YOU'RE THE ONES
THAT'S GONNA BE GOING TO JAIL,

27:58.300 --> 27:59.380
I GUARANTEE IT.

27:59.420 --> 28:01.260
OKAY, SO YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF THE COPS.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.930
FAIR ENOUGH. BUT SONJA,
LET ME TELL YOU, MAN,

28:03.970 --> 28:05.600
THAT'S ANOTHER STORY
ALL TOGETHER.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.890
WHO? I DON'T EVEN KNOW
A SONJA. WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

28:07.930 --> 28:09.060
-LIAR!
-ALL RIGHT!

28:09.100 --> 28:10.520
SOMEBODY ELSE
SET THE WHOLE THING UP.

28:11.140 --> 28:12.230
-WHAT?
-CRAP.

28:12.270 --> 28:13.730
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SAY THAT.

28:13.770 --> 28:16.860
[JAKE]
SO, JOHNNY, THE INFORMANT,
HE WAS YOUR CONTACT.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.780
ALL YOU KNEW IS YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE ROBBED.

28:19.820 --> 28:21.780
YOU NEVER MET SONJA
FIRST NOR LAST, DID YOU?

28:21.820 --> 28:23.780
MAKE ME LISTEN TO
GOWAN AGAIN,

28:23.820 --> 28:26.120
I DON'T CARE.
I'M NOT SAYING NOTHING.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.790
&lt;SIGHS&gt;
HOW CAN I PUT THIS?

28:28.830 --> 28:32.920
SONJA, UH, SHE
DOESN'T EXACTLY HAVE
A GREAT REPUTATION

28:32.960 --> 28:34.710
WHEN IT COMES
TO DEALING WITH
HER PARTNERS.

28:34.750 --> 28:37.420
YEAH! MEANING
SHE'S KILLED THEM ALL.

28:38.510 --> 28:39.880
AND MY BET IS YOU
NEVER EVEN MET SONJA.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.260
YOU WERE JUST SUPPOSED
TO MEET UP WITH HER

28:41.300 --> 28:42.380
AFTER SHE
PULLED THE JOB

28:42.430 --> 28:43.970
AND YOU WERE GOING
TO SPLIT THE GOLD!

28:44.010 --> 28:46.470
[JAKE] &lt;SIGHS&gt; I'M SORRY
ABOUT HIM, BUT LET ME
TELL YA. SONJA,

28:46.510 --> 28:48.720
SHE'S A SERIOUS
PSYCHOPATH.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.230
TELL US WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO MEET HER.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.350
THAT'S ALL
YOU GOTTA DO.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.900
OKAY. I WAS SUPPOSED TO
MEET THIS LADY,

28:54.940 --> 28:55.770
WHATEVER HER NAME IS.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.610
AT A WAREHOUSE
ON TORBAY ROAD.

28:59.650 --> 29:00.940
AFTER THE JOB WAS DONE.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.820
GOOD. GOOD MAN.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

29:05.620 --> 29:07.660
-JUST GO TAKE A BREATHER.
-OKAY.

29:07.700 --> 29:10.120
DAD. YEAH.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.830
LOOKS LIKE
I GOT A LEAD.

29:16.790 --> 29:18.960
ANY WORD
ON POPPY OR JAKE?

29:19.750 --> 29:21.510
WHAT'S THIS?

29:21.550 --> 29:23.470
NOTHING.
IT'S A SCIENCE PROJECT.

29:23.510 --> 29:24.880
DNA.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.680
LITTLE ADVANCED FOR
HIGH SCHOOL, ISN'T IT?

29:29.760 --> 29:30.810
DNA?

29:31.720 --> 29:33.940
TINNY! WHAT ARE YOU...

29:33.980 --> 29:36.600
PLEASE TELL ME GEORGE IS
NOT MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

29:39.020 --> 29:40.780
GEORGE? &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

29:42.860 --> 29:46.030
NO. NO, HONEY.

29:46.070 --> 29:48.830
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE. NO.

29:50.700 --> 29:53.450
WELL, WHAT IS HE DOING
WITH A PICTURE OF ME
IN HIS POCKET?

29:55.870 --> 29:58.670
THAT HAS MORE TO DO
WITH ME THAN YOU.

29:58.710 --> 29:59.840
OKAY?

29:59.880 --> 30:01.960
THAT'S A LONG STORY.
SO, COME ON.

30:02.510 --> 30:03.920
RIGHT.

30:07.260 --> 30:10.680
YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M
OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
WHO MY FATHER IS.

30:16.890 --> 30:18.020
OKAY, TINNY.

30:18.730 --> 30:20.820
OKAY. LISTEN...

30:25.570 --> 30:29.370
NOBODY KNOWS
WHO THAT IS. OKAY?

30:29.410 --> 30:32.200
NOT POPPY,
NOT EVEN JAKE.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.910
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO KNOW?

30:33.950 --> 30:37.080
YEAH. I'M SURE.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.960
'CAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT
LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.840
[MAL] THIS IS THE ADDRESS
WHERE SONJA WAS SUPPOSED
TO MEET THE GUARD.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.850
&lt;CLATTERING&gt;

31:02.690 --> 31:04.280
GOING SOMEWHERE?

31:04.320 --> 31:05.860
HOW DID YOU FIND ME HERE?

31:08.150 --> 31:09.490
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

31:12.030 --> 31:14.290
-NICE WORK!
-I HAVE A FEW TRICKS
UP MY SLEEVE.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.580
APPARENTLY.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.120
&lt;HANDCUFFS RATTLING&gt;

31:18.160 --> 31:21.830
[JAKE] COME ON! WE ONLY GOT
A FEW MINUTES TO GET
THIS OUT OF THE IMPOUND LOT.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.090
&lt;CAR ENGINE STALLING&gt;

31:23.130 --> 31:25.590
OH. YOU'RE GONNA FLOOD HER!

31:25.630 --> 31:28.340
OH, SHE'S HURTING
PRETTY BAD, JAKE.
I CAN FEEL HER PAIN.

31:30.470 --> 31:32.100
&lt;CAR ENGINE STARTING&gt;

31:32.140 --> 31:33.930
MOVE OVER. PUT ON YOUR
SEATBELT. NOW!

31:33.970 --> 31:35.930
[GUARD] HEY, YOU!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

31:36.680 --> 31:37.930
STOP THAT CAR!

31:39.020 --> 31:41.770
STOP! STOP! GET BACK HERE!

31:52.450 --> 31:53.910
[SONJA] LET ME GO.

31:53.950 --> 31:55.990
SONJA, WHY DID
YOU DO ALL OF THIS?

31:56.790 --> 31:58.660
TO REECE? TO ME?

31:58.710 --> 32:01.000
BECAUSE I NEED MONEY, MAL.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.500
MY LIFE'S A MESS. OKAY?

32:03.540 --> 32:05.710
A MESS? YOU DON'T SAY.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.130
I'M DESPERATE.

32:08.590 --> 32:11.300
I'M IN HUGE DEBT TO
REALLY BAD PEOPLE.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.050
IT WAS GAMBLING AND DRUGS.
ALL OF IT.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.680
THIS IS MY ONLY WAY OUT.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.560
ONLY WAY OUT?

32:19.600 --> 32:20.640
OTHER THAN PUTTING

32:20.690 --> 32:22.060
THE BARREL OF A GUN
IN MY MOUTH

32:22.100 --> 32:23.020
AND BLOWING MY HEAD OFF.

32:23.060 --> 32:24.650
AND I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
DOING THAT PLENTY OF TIMES.

32:24.690 --> 32:26.020
INSTEAD, YOU KILLED
REECE AND JOHNNY.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.730
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO
HAPPEN LIKE THAT.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.530
REECE BACKED OUT
AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE.

32:29.570 --> 32:31.490
IT WAS TOO LATE
AND I COULDN'T TURN BACK.

32:31.530 --> 32:33.700
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO
TURN BACK NOW.

32:33.740 --> 32:35.870
AND YOU ARE GOING
TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE TO US.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.160
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

32:38.370 --> 32:39.910
YOU'RE GONNA UNCUFF ME

32:39.950 --> 32:42.210
AND GET THE GOLD,
BECAUSE I'M LEAVING TONIGHT.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.460
I'M GONNA WHAT?

32:43.500 --> 32:46.130
I HAVE AN INSURANCE
POLICY, MAL.

32:46.170 --> 32:47.880
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOOD AT.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.340
MY SPECIALTY IN THE FORCE.

32:50.050 --> 32:51.380
YOU PLANTED A BOMB.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.590
WHERE?

32:54.340 --> 32:55.930
IN YOUR WORLD.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.560
YOUR HOME, YOUR OFFICE...

32:59.600 --> 33:01.980
I'M NOT SAYING WHERE
UNTIL I'M GONE

33:02.020 --> 33:03.560
AND I HAVE WHAT I CAME FOR.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.940
YOU'RE BLUFFING.

33:06.980 --> 33:10.030
LET ME GO OR SOMEONE IN
YOUR FAMILY WILL DIE.

33:13.780 --> 33:17.160
SONJA, PLEASE, JUST TELL US.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.240
-YOU OWE ME THAT.
-MAL! YOU GOT 30 MINUTES

33:20.290 --> 33:22.000

SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET HURT.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.960
DON'T TEST ME!

33:24.000 --> 33:25.960
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE DIED
ALREADY, DON'T YOU THINK?

33:27.340 --> 33:28.710
OKAY.

33:29.380 --> 33:30.920
-YOU WIN.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.850

WE NEED TO GET
THE GOLD TO SONJA.

33:48.190 --> 33:50.690
OKAY, DID SHE PLANT
A BOMB SOMEWHERE?

33:50.730 --> 33:51.820
THAT'S RIGHT, SON.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.490
WE HAVE TO GIVE
SONJA THE GOLD.

33:53.530 --> 33:54.950
WE HAVE 30 MINUTES.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.660
DO YOU UNDERSTAND.

33:56.700 --> 33:58.120
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

34:40.580 --> 34:43.240
UM, YEAH.

34:44.330 --> 34:45.160
I THINK I GOT IT.

34:50.290 --> 34:51.540
SHOULD WE NOT CALL THE COPS?

34:51.590 --> 34:54.130
NO, WE CAN'T, OKAY?
SONJA HAS DAD AND ROSE.

34:54.170 --> 34:57.130
PLUS, IF THE COPS SEE ME,
THEY'LL ARREST ME ON SIGHT.

34:57.170 --> 34:59.390
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
WE CAN'T TAKE IT
OUT OF HERE.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.510
IF WE MOVE IT, THE WHOLE
THING MIGHT BLOW.

35:01.550 --> 35:02.930
LISTEN...

35:06.180 --> 35:08.230
I NEED YOU TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND CLEAR OUT THE BAR.

35:08.270 --> 35:09.150
-ALL RIGHT?
-JAKE...

35:09.190 --> 35:11.190
CHRISTIAN, PLEASE.

35:11.230 --> 35:13.480
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE
ANYONE GET HURT FROM THIS.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.280
FINE.

35:45.770 --> 35:47.350
WE GOT
PLUMBING PROBLEMS.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.850
-SO, THANKS.
THANKS FOR COMING.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.360
HEY, BUDDY, YOUR TIMING
COULDN'T BE WORSE.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.230

BECAUSE I WAS
ON A REAL ROLL

35:54.270 --> 35:55.610

PEACE AND LOVE THING.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU
OR YOUR SISTER, OKAY.

35:57.860 --> 36:00.360
I WILL LEAVE WHEN I GET
WHAT'S OWED TO ME!

36:00.400 --> 36:02.280
FAIR ENOUGH. BUT I'M
NOT HAPPY ABOUT

36:02.320 --> 36:03.780
WHAT YOU'RE FORCING ME
TO DO HERE.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.330
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

36:06.490 --> 36:09.000
BY THE WAY, EH, SEE THAT?

36:10.620 --> 36:12.290
YEAH, HE'S ON THE RUN
FOR TWO MURDERS.

36:12.330 --> 36:14.960
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
HE'S THE SENSITIVE ONE

36:15.000 --> 36:16.300
SO GET OUT OF HERE!

36:20.930 --> 36:22.890
OKAY, OKAY,

SO THAT THE BOMB

36:46.700 --> 36:47.910

36:47.950 --> 36:49.160
[JAKE] WELL, HURRY UP

36:49.200 --> 36:51.460
I AM! WHY WOULD SONJA

36:51.500 --> 36:53.120
&lt;SIGHS&gt; I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S DESPERATE, OKAY?

36:53.170 --> 36:54.790
YOU... YOU SEE A CHANCE

NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE KILLED A FEW PEOPLE.

36:56.460 --> 36:57.710
YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.340
IS IT ODD THAT I FIND HER
EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE?

36:59.380 --> 37:01.470
I MEAN, SHE... SHE'S PRETTY.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.140
AND SHE'S BAD.

'CAUSE I CAN DO THIS
ON MY OWN.

37:25.570 --> 37:26.740
AND IF I HAVE TO DIE,

37:26.780 --> 37:27.910
I'D REALLY RATHER

38:05.150 --> 38:07.320
-YOU WERE ALWAYS SO GOOD.

38:48.410 --> 38:52.540

38:52.580 --> 38:54.330
[SONJA] GOOD WORK, JAKE.

38:54.370 --> 38:55.540
DID YOU FIND
BOTH OF THEM?

38:55.580 --> 38:57.330

39:37.410 --> 39:39.420
-HOW'S MY HAIR LOOK?
-AWESOME.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.380
-WHAT ABOUT ME?
-FANTASTIC.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.010
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
START BUYING LOTTERY TICKETS.

39:47.050 --> 39:49.130
THAT LUCKY HORSESHOE
YOU GOT UP YOUR ARSE,

39:49.180 --> 39:51.090
COULD BE PUT TO
MUCH BETTER USE.

39:51.140 --> 39:54.510
SEE, I TOLD YOU. I HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.060
THE STOLEN GOLD WAS
NEVER ACTUALLY STOLEN.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.520
THE SENIOR GUARD ADMITTED
THAT IT WAS A HUSH-HUSH

39:59.560 --> 40:02.900
AND COMPLICATED TRAINING
MANEUVER FOR THE NEW STAFF.

40:02.940 --> 40:04.570
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK FOR NOW.

40:04.610 --> 40:08.190
IT'S TOO BAD I CAN'T SAY
THE SAME FOR ROSE
AND YOUR DAD.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.240
IT'S LOOKING
PRETTY GRIM, JAKE.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.240
THAT MURDER CHARGE
IS REALLY STICKY.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.070
AND ROSE IS BEING NAMED
AS AN ACCOMPLICE.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.490
COME ON, YOU KNOW HOW
RIDICULOUS THAT SOUNDS.

40:16.540 --> 40:20.040
I WARNED YOU. OKAY?
ALL OF YOU, ACTUALLY.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.790
IT DIDN'T NEED TO
TURN OUT THIS WAY.

40:22.630 --> 40:24.380
YOU DOYLES NEVER LISTEN.

40:25.540 --> 40:26.840
COME ON.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.380
I LOVE YOU, MALACHY.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.840
YOU, TOO. WE'LL FIGURE
THIS OUT, OKAY?

40:30.880 --> 40:32.010
OKAY.

40:37.220 --> 40:38.520
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

40:40.560 --> 40:42.770
HEY, JAKE. I'M DOING
A COMPLETE SWEEP OF ALL DOYLE

40:42.810 --> 40:44.860
PROPERTIES FOR THE OTHER BOMBS
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS

40:44.900 --> 40:46.690
I HAVEN'T FOUND
ANY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES YET.

40:46.730 --> 40:49.940
AND I FOUND $3.47 IN CHANGE
AND A MISSING SWATCH.

40:49.990 --> 40:53.240
YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SWEPT THE GTO, BECAUSE

40:53.280 --> 40:55.700
SONJA... SONJA BLEW IT UP.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.080
I... I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.660
SHOULD I CALL THE AUTO CLUB
OR A FUNERAL HOME
OR SOMETHING?

41:01.710 --> 41:04.040
LOOK, WE JUST NEED TO
FIND WHERE SONJA IS,

41:04.080 --> 41:07.800
SO WE CAN GET SOME EVIDENCE
TO GET MAL AND ROSE
OUT OF THIS MESS.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.460
OH, OH, I THINK I MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.630
I WAS GOING THROUGH
SONJA'S LAPTOP

41:10.670 --> 41:13.220
AND I FOUND, UH,
A DIGITAL RECEIPT
ENCRYPTED IN HER EMAIL.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.220
I'M GOING TO SEND IT TO
YOU RIGHT NOW.

41:15.260 --> 41:17.050
IT LOOKS LIKE HER...
HER GETAWAY PLAN.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.430
PERFECT.

41:22.390 --> 41:25.560
YOU KNOW, ONE OF
THE THINGS YOU FIGURE OUT

41:25.600 --> 41:28.520
ABOUT LIVING ON AN ISLAND
IS THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE
OF WAYS

41:28.570 --> 41:30.030
TO GET OFF OF HER.

41:30.070 --> 41:33.200
I'M GUESSING THIS IS
YOUR BIG ESCAPE PLAN, HUH?

41:33.240 --> 41:34.820
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.870
I'M GETTING ON
THAT PLANE, JAKE.

41:36.910 --> 41:38.700
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO SHOOT ME,

41:38.740 --> 41:41.580
COULD YOU AT LEAST
TELL ME FIRST WHY
YOU KILLED JOHNNY

41:41.620 --> 41:42.660
AND WHY YOU KILLED REECE?

41:42.710 --> 41:45.040
THINK OF IT AS A DYING
MAN'S WISH.

41:46.790 --> 41:48.710
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
AGAIN?

41:48.750 --> 41:50.590
WELL, YOU CAN'T BLAME ME
FOR TRYING, RIGHT?

41:51.760 --> 41:53.720
YOU AND YOUR DAD,
YOU'RE JUST THE SAME.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.300
JUST NEVER GIVE UP, DO YOU?

41:55.340 --> 41:56.470
MY DAD.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.060
HE WAS YOUR MENTOR
AND YOUR FRIEND.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.350
SO WAS REECE.

42:01.390 --> 42:04.020
YEAH, REECE WAS MY FRIEND.
HE OFFERED ME HELP.

42:04.060 --> 42:08.560
SET IT UP. AND THEN
HE BACKED OUT AT
THE LAST MINUTE.

42:08.610 --> 42:11.480
I NEEDED THE CASH
AND DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME
EMPTY HANDED.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.900
SO YOU DECIDE TO PIN
THE WHOLE THING
ON MY FATHER.

42:13.940 --> 42:16.410
THIS IS NOT WHAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

42:16.450 --> 42:17.780
WELL, IT DID.

42:17.820 --> 42:19.660
WELL, I'M SORRY.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.370
OKAY?

42:22.660 --> 42:24.750
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?

42:24.790 --> 42:26.620
WHAT'S THE SAYING, YOU KNOW,
FOOL ME ONCE,

42:26.670 --> 42:27.960
FOOL ME TWICE OR WHATEVER.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.380
I'M WEARING TWO WIRES.

42:33.920 --> 42:37.550
I SHOULD SHOOT YOU
RIGHT NOW FOR WHAT
YOU DID TO MY CAR!

42:38.640 --> 42:39.550
&lt;GROANING&gt;

42:55.650 --> 42:56.740
&lt;SLOW MUSIC PLAYING&gt;

43:12.170 --> 43:13.670
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

43:18.720 --> 43:19.800
BENNETT.

43:24.060 --> 43:25.560
OH, MY GOD.

43:28.390 --> 43:29.810
&lt;INAUDIBLE&gt;
