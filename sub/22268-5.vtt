WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.170
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Welcome back, friends.

00:02.203 --> 00:04.072
When we left our Jane,
she'd rekindled things

00:04.105 --> 00:06.107
with her first love, Adam.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.541
I am all in, Jane.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.378
So, yeah.
They were pretty smitten.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.080
And speaking of smitten,

00:12.113 --> 00:13.547
Jane's father Rogelio
had finally married

00:13.581 --> 00:15.283
her mother Xiomara.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.550
Only complication,

00:16.584 --> 00:18.419
he had a baby with Darci.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.321
And they named her...

00:20.354 --> 00:21.455
Well, I'll let him explain.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.723
First name, Baby.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.159
JANE:
My baby sister, Baby.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.327
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah. And complicating that...

00:26.360 --> 00:27.328
Oh.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.630
...Darci started dating
his rival Esteban.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.066
I know. Straight out
of a telenovela, right?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.567
Which makes sense,
because Rogelio

00:33.601 --> 00:35.569
was a huge telenovela star.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.738
Though right now, he was
playing someone very tiny,

00:37.771 --> 00:39.473
who was swallowed
by his love interest,

00:39.507 --> 00:41.475
and was currently stuck
inside her body.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.376
Just go with it, okay?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.412
And speaking
of star-crossed lovers,

00:44.445 --> 00:46.547
Jane and Rafael
were currently estranged.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.450
See, he'd lost all his money,
and so he was scheming

00:49.483 --> 00:51.252
against his sister Luisa
to get his hotel back.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.122
For the last time,
I am doing this for my family!

00:54.155 --> 00:57.558
And as for Luisa, well,
she made a new friend, Carl.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.427
Only problem...
Dr. Luisa introduced me

00:59.460 --> 01:00.828
to her friend Carl,

01:00.861 --> 01:02.796
but there was no one there.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.333
So, yeah, Luisa
was definitely struggling.

01:05.366 --> 01:08.336
But Raf didn't know that.
He just wanted his hotel back.

01:08.369 --> 01:11.372
So he got into bed with hotel
financier Katherine Cortes.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.475
Literally. But he had a change
of heart about using her.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.345
And well, the consequences
came fast and furious.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.313
(tires screech)
I know.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.782
OMG, right? So let's dive in.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.518
Ah, friends.

01:24.552 --> 01:28.122
As you well know,
our Jane played many roles.

01:28.156 --> 01:31.225
And so, she had many labels.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.361
She was a mother.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.563
She was a lover.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.766
She was a writer, of course.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.302
But before she was
any of those things,

01:41.335 --> 01:43.904
she was a best friend.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.439
To Lina.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.674
Like my new hat?

01:46.707 --> 01:49.843
I stole it
from my sisters.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.413
You're gonna get
in so much trouble.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.515
(laughs)
NARRATOR: Of course, of the two,

01:54.548 --> 01:56.384
Lina was the bold one.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.419
She was adventurous.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.454
Want me to teach you
how to put on eye makeup?

02:00.488 --> 02:02.656
Yeah. But no wings.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.857
Then what's even the point?

02:03.891 --> 02:05.326
(sighs)

02:05.359 --> 02:07.361
The kind of person
who went for it.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.496
(quietly):
Kiss him.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.199
Which is why Jane knew

02:11.232 --> 02:12.666
her bachelorette party
had to be...

02:12.700 --> 02:15.236
A 1930s murder mystery theme?

02:15.269 --> 02:16.470
Really?

02:16.504 --> 02:18.306
I know. I was confused, too.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.940
I had our favorite stripper
on hold.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.742
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
He's my favorite, too.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.616
But, apparently, this is
what Lina and Danny want.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.485
So, I will make it
totally perfect.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.655
Because that is my solemn duty
as Lina's lifetime BFF.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.689
Oh, no.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.824
Oh, don't tell me

02:36.857 --> 02:37.958
that Dad can't get the costumes.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.727
No. Sorry.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.829
I just realized
I forgot to take the pill.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.664
Again? Why are you even
still on the pill?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.266
There are so many other options.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.734
The ring, the shot,
the patch, the cap.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.702
Look at you, Planned Parenthood.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.371
Thank you.
(laughs)

02:50.404 --> 02:51.739
Anyway, I've tried a few.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.741
Your dad just wants
to pull out, but...

02:53.774 --> 02:56.444
Oh. Okay. All right.
I'm gonna get going.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.280
Please tell Dad thank you
for the costumes and the props.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.450
(phone ringing)
Oh.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.985
(scoffs)

03:05.018 --> 03:07.555
Petra?
Everything's fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.423
What do you mean?
Worry about what?
I just said there's nothing

03:09.457 --> 03:11.992
to worry about.
Well, that's a really weird way
to start a phone call.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.762
Rafael was in a little
car accident.
What?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.530
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Little?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.432
He looks like he was hit
by a Mack truck.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.868
Or, say, a late model sedan.

03:20.901 --> 03:21.869
But he's fine. Truly.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.837
Uh, actually, we're just
about to get discharged,

03:23.871 --> 03:25.539
so I'm just letting you know.
Okay.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.474
Well, tell him...

03:26.507 --> 03:28.909
I'm glad he's okay.
I will.

03:28.942 --> 03:32.513
I'm telling you,
it wasn't an accident.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.448
Oh, I'm sure. I mean,
you basically told Katherine

03:34.482 --> 03:36.284
you were using her
before the deal closed.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.418
What were you thinking?

03:37.451 --> 03:39.453
I just couldn't
go through with it.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.490
Oh.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.957
You got Villanuevaed.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.498
That's not true.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.000
Or even if it is a little true,

03:53.033 --> 03:55.403
I never would've worked
with Katherine long-term.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.671
Obviously, because
she's completely nuts.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.507
Oh, you don't think so?

03:59.540 --> 04:02.543
My sister tried to drown me
at sea. I have a high bar.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.611
NURSE:
All right.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.712
You are officially discharged.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.746
Wound care.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.448
Keep an eye on the color.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.317
We don't want to be
seeing green pus.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.551
We want to see red blood.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.687
This stuff is
terrific. Terrific!

04:13.721 --> 04:15.556
Please tell your dad thanks.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.725
Does he want to come,
by the way? Or your mom?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.460
We still have some
roles to assign.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.462
He'll be shooting,
but I'll ask my mom.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.598
Yeah, tell your grandma
to come, too.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.566
That's a great idea!

04:25.599 --> 04:26.867
We need a dowager.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.935
Seriously?

04:27.968 --> 04:30.771
Hey! So sorry
I'm late, babe.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.540
(laughing): Oh, my God.
Still with the "babe."

04:33.374 --> 04:35.643
I mean, nice to see you again.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.311
Don't mess things up this time.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.579
I'm trying
really hard not to.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.480
(laughs)

04:39.513 --> 04:41.415
Congratulations,
bride-to-be.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.483
Thank you.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.484
This is my fiancé, Danny.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.652
Hey.
Hey.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.487
You look so familiar.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.055
Yeah, you do, too, actually.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.557
Did you ever live in New York?

04:49.590 --> 04:50.891
Yeah. Fort Greene.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.326
Oh, I had a bunch
of friends there.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.627
Uh, do you know
Joey Brixton?

04:53.661 --> 04:55.363
Jenny Lawson?
Mm...

04:55.396 --> 04:57.064
Let me check our mutuals.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.700
(quietly): See?
They're destined to be friends.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.536
Wait.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.539
Yeah, you two
used to date, right?

05:05.573 --> 05:06.740
Yeah.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.576
Ooh.

05:08.609 --> 05:12.012
Oh, sh-she's really pretty.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.414
Not her.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.549
Him.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.584
Oh.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.387
Cool.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.455
He's also very pretty.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.864
So, you're bisexual?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.866
If you're into labels.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.736
You date men and women?

05:35.769 --> 05:40.007
I had a boyfriend in art school
when everyone was experimenting,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.743
and another in Fort Greene
when everyone wasn't.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.112
Cool.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.715
It's just, we've had
so many long talks.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.783
How come you never
mentioned this?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.585
It just didn't really feel
that relevant.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.120
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I mean,
more relevant than who'd win

05:53.153 --> 05:55.556
in an epic battle between
Batman and Wolverine.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.658
Which has been
discussed at length.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.561
And I guess I was nervous.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.996
It's become an issue
with people I've dated before.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.668
Well, you've never
dated me before.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.703
Okay, you have.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.104
N-Not recently.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.740
My point is, is...

06:12.773 --> 06:14.708
(scoffs)
I'm totally okay with it.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.876
You have exes,
I have exes.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.478
Everybody has exes.
(chuckles)

06:17.511 --> 06:19.179
PETRA:
I'm trying, I'm trying!

06:19.212 --> 06:21.682
How hard can it be? Just...
(screams) Don't-don't pull!

06:21.715 --> 06:23.417
I'm sorry!
I'm just a little stressed.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.686
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
New role for Petra: nursemaid.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.421
Don't be. We're gonna
find another investor,

06:27.455 --> 06:29.557
and we'll make another offer.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.192
(knocking on door)
(scoffs) Unless Katherine
tells Luisa what we were doing.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.694
The woman already ran me over.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.763
I think she got her revenge.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.431
(scoffs)

06:37.465 --> 06:39.199
I know Rafael was working
with Katherine Cortes.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.535
Guess she wanted a little more.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.136
What are you doing
here? Security!

06:43.170 --> 06:46.006
Someone call security!
Luisa! Luisa!

06:46.039 --> 06:48.609
Rafael was just in an awful
car accident. Look at him.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.578
Please. Like I would ever

06:50.611 --> 06:53.046
fall for that.
It's obviously a sympathy ploy.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.014
(screams)

06:54.047 --> 06:55.449
What?
Ah. Oh.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.984
So it's not a sympathy ploy.
Luisa, please.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.719
Can he just stay here
till he gets better?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.020
Look, there's a guest room.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.789
No. And if you
ever step foot

07:01.822 --> 07:04.091
on my property again,
I will have you arrested.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.160
When did you become such
a nasty, hateful person...
Me? Me? No.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.696
...incapable of forgiveness
and compassion?!
You're the horrible person,

07:08.729 --> 07:10.764
Rafael. You can pretend
you're not, but you are.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.000
You're obsessed with money
and power, just like Dad.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.668
ELLIE:
Mommy!

07:15.669 --> 07:17.705
Everything's fine.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.673
Why don't you take the girls
down to the gift shop?

07:19.707 --> 07:22.075
We don't really need
another sparkly turtle.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.944
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

07:23.977 --> 07:25.779
Alba.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.181
See, she, too,
plays many roles.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.688
Jorge's girlfriend.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.658
(gasps)
Hi, girls.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.026
What can I get for you?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.661
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Top merchandiser.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.930
Daddy's getting kicked
out of the hotel again,

07:42.963 --> 07:45.065
so we're supposed
to buy something.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.738
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And captain of Team Rafael.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.773
(grunts)

07:54.074 --> 07:57.210
You said it was a
little car accident.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.846
Well, technically,
Petra said that.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.214
What happened, Daddy?

08:01.248 --> 08:04.518
I didn't look both ways
before I crossed the street.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.228
Hmm?

08:16.764 --> 08:18.732
What happened? Where were you?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.300
I broke up with Katherine.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.669
I told her
the truth,

08:21.702 --> 08:23.771
that I was using her,

08:23.804 --> 08:26.574
and she got pissed
and tried to run me over.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.208
What?

08:28.241 --> 08:31.311
Yeah. She's denying it,
but she did it on purpose.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.813
And yes,

08:32.846 --> 08:35.783
you were right. About her,
and about this whole thing

08:35.816 --> 08:37.951
being a bad idea,
but I really don't need

08:37.985 --> 08:39.620
"I told you so" right now, okay?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.627
(voice breaking):
Rafael.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.698
What has happened to you?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.600
To us?

08:52.633 --> 08:55.302
That you think
I would ever say that?

08:55.335 --> 08:56.870
I'm just happy
that you're okay,

08:56.904 --> 08:59.773
and I just really
want us to be okay.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.175
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup. Just a fantasy.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.811
Here's what she really said.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.680
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.881
I'm gonna go to bed.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.950
(inhales shakily)

09:14.788 --> 09:16.590
(doorbell rings)

09:18.125 --> 09:19.359
Hi.
Hi.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.894
(laughing):
Hey.
(laughs)

09:20.928 --> 09:22.262
Oh.
Hi.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.697
What's going on?

09:23.731 --> 09:25.599
I just wanted to stop by.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.934
Danny's at the airport,

09:26.967 --> 09:29.202
picking up some of his friends
for the party.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.605
Hmm. Oh. You okay?

09:31.639 --> 09:32.940
Totally, yes.

09:32.973 --> 09:33.874
But listen,
I'd love for you

09:33.907 --> 09:35.709
to spend some time
with Danny this weekend.

09:35.743 --> 09:36.777
One-on-one.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.845
Oh. Sure.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.613
I'd love to get
to know him better.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.048
Perfect. Great.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.883
Because I'm not sure
I should marry him,

09:42.916 --> 09:44.284
and I need you to tell me
what to do.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.393
Lina, back up.
Oh, God.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.394
What's going on?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.396
Did you and Danny fight?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.632
No. We never fight.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.133
And maybe that's part
of the problem.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.770
Uh, what problem?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.772
Where is this
even coming from?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.940
My sisters staged
an intervention.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.142
They are convinced that
I'm making a mistake.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.679
They think I'll be
divorced by Christmas.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.246
A-And what if
they're right?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.648
They know me.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.116
And they've all
been divorced.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.985
Which just means they picked
badly for themselves,

10:18.018 --> 10:19.653
not that you did.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.288
Come on. You fell in love
with Danny for a reason.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.256
What are some of the things
you love about him?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.192
Well, he's-he's so sweet,

10:25.225 --> 10:28.161
and smart and so supportive.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.396
Plus, he's great in bed.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.965
God, what a nightmare.
You poor thing.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.433
But he's such a
square sometimes.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.802
What do you mean?

10:34.835 --> 10:37.204
He has bisexual friends
from Fort Greene.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.173
This murder mystery theme?

10:40.207 --> 10:41.675
It was supposed to be

10:41.709 --> 10:44.344
a bachelor/bachelorette party.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.280
Why would he think that I would
like something like that?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.717
I don't want to have to learn
a bunch of new words

10:49.750 --> 10:50.684
for my bachelorette party.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.720
What the hell is
a dowager?!

10:52.753 --> 10:55.723
A widow who got her title
from her late husband.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.859
Look, Lina, I was...

10:58.892 --> 11:00.293
surprised by the theme, too.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.731
See? And, Jane,
he likes to ski.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.133
You know how much
I hate the cold.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.435
Plus, he doesn't have
a spontaneous bone in his body.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.470
What if I want us
to quit our jobs

11:10.503 --> 11:11.905
and travel the world
for a year?

11:11.939 --> 11:13.907
I mean, do you?

11:13.941 --> 11:16.710
Assuming it's
first-class airfare

11:16.744 --> 11:19.246
and five-star hotels,
which he would never go for

11:19.279 --> 11:21.481
because he's so
freaking practical!

11:21.514 --> 11:22.950
Okay, you're spiraling.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.818
I know.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.721
Which is why I need you
to tell me what to do.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.290
XIOMARA: Not your place,
and not your role.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.259
Just tell Lina
that Danny is great,

11:32.292 --> 11:34.061
and you're completely
on board with the two of them.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.764
It's just the two of us.
No Baby.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.998
JANE:
But she asked for my help.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.967
I mean,
don't I owe it to her

11:40.000 --> 11:41.969
to give my honest opinion
no matter what?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.937
If you want to stay friends
with her, no.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.739
I absolutely want
to stay friends with you.

11:45.773 --> 11:46.940
Sexy friends.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.109
Tell Dad I can hear him.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.945
It's a lose-lose

11:51.979 --> 11:54.014
situation, Janie.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.115
If you say he sucks,

11:55.148 --> 11:56.183
and she marries him anyway,

11:56.216 --> 11:58.018
that will always be between you.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.056
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And again, friends,

12:03.090 --> 12:05.759
there was just so much
she wanted to say.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.796
Trust me, just leave
well enough alone, Jane.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.335
ROGELIO:
Now what's wrong?

12:15.368 --> 12:16.804
There's something I want
to talk with you about

12:16.837 --> 12:17.871
before we have sex.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.773
Okay, a quick something, huh?

12:19.807 --> 12:22.776
Ideally.
Mm.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.544
I want you to get
a vasectomy.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.480
Oh. I think

12:27.514 --> 12:30.884
it's a language thing, you know,
but I thought you said...

12:30.918 --> 12:33.420
I did. I want you
to get a vasectomy.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.890
Are you insane, woman?!

12:36.924 --> 12:39.059
It's a very common
and safe procedure,

12:39.092 --> 12:40.460
and I'm tired of
taking the pill.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.561
Well, then, tie your tubes.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.230
That's an invasive surgery.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.465
A vasectomy is just
a snip-- in and out.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.801
Well, the answer is no.

12:47.835 --> 12:51.071
I'm not being... neutered,
and that's that.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.040
Never. No way.
It's not gonna happen.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.875
Stop being such a baby.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.377
Well, "Baby" is the greatest
name in the world,

12:57.410 --> 12:59.546
so I will take that
as a compliment,

12:59.579 --> 13:02.850
no matter how
it was intended.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.252
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of penis panic...

13:07.187 --> 13:09.522
Here you go.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.958
Nice tats.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.794
*

13:23.503 --> 13:26.306
So, is... is that your type?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.241
What?
Just asking.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.242
If I'm into the waiter?

13:29.276 --> 13:31.044
I, uh, I didn't notice,

13:31.078 --> 13:32.545
because I'm with you.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.614
Right.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.985
Sorry, I'm acting weird.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.320
I'm just trying to
wrap my head around it

13:40.353 --> 13:42.222
because I'm not
into women.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.358
Maybe.
Or maybe you just haven't

13:45.392 --> 13:46.927
explored that side of yourself.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.562
Just to let you know,
my shift is over,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.231
but my colleague Justine
will treat you right.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.934
It's been a pleasure.

13:53.967 --> 13:58.105
(sultry music playing)

13:58.138 --> 13:59.572
*

14:04.311 --> 14:05.612
Is that a yes on the refill?

14:05.645 --> 14:08.615
Sorry, yes.
Thank you so much.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.283
JUSTINE:
You're welcome.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.885
(laughs nervously)

14:11.919 --> 14:14.888
Hey, look, is this something
that's gonna get in our way?

14:14.922 --> 14:16.023
What? No.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.958
Because you seem
pretty hung up on it.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.260
Honestly, I'm not.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.263
I'm completely hung up on it.
And I don't want to be.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.165
Well, it makes sense
that you are.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.667
Yeah, because it took him
so long to tell me.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.037
And because there's
a double standard, you know?

14:30.070 --> 14:32.472
When women hook up,
it's looked at as sexy,

14:32.505 --> 14:34.607
but men are immediately
marginalized

14:34.641 --> 14:37.310
because our whole culture
revolves around the male gaze.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.518
I'm not exactly
following all that,

14:45.552 --> 14:47.487
but I hear you about
the double standards.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.056
Your dad's killing me.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.590
He said no to the vasectomy?

14:50.623 --> 14:52.359
Again, he started talking
about pulling out.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.426
Ma-- ugh!

14:54.627 --> 14:56.363
Again, I'm pulling out
of this conversation.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.365
We were talking
about Ro's vasectomy.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.399
Ah.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.205
He owns more makeup
than I do.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.007
He's campaigning to be
the next Cover Girl.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.287
Mom!

15:26.259 --> 15:28.728
Okay, now I'm pulling out
of this conversation.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.298
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, the good old days.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.200
DANNY: Is this a farthing
or a tuppence?

15:34.201 --> 15:36.003
I'm gonna say a tuppence.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.104
(imitates buzzer)
Oh.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.606
Sorry, trick question.
It's a ha'penny.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.741
Oh. (chuckles, sighs)

15:41.774 --> 15:44.677
Uh, so, where is Lina?

15:44.711 --> 15:45.979
Running a last-minute errand.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.081
(phone chimes)
Oh...

15:48.115 --> 15:49.182
(clears throat)

15:55.222 --> 15:57.024
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Guess Jane's spending

15:57.057 --> 15:59.059
that one-on-one time
with Danny right now.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.666
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, we last left our Jane

16:06.699 --> 16:08.335
in a most uncomfortable role.

16:16.276 --> 16:20.280
So, uh, have you done
a murder mystery party before?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.382
Yep. Never been
the Duke, though.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.252
Hmm.
I've been the Constable
and the Butler before.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.453
Stuck being
the Silversmith twice.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.188
Don't even get me started.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.256
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I think you started.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.390
(laughs nervously)

16:30.423 --> 16:31.458
Sure, I may have rigged it

16:31.491 --> 16:33.626
so I was assigned the part,
but I figure I can,

16:33.660 --> 16:35.428
since I'm the groom and all.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.297
I mean, if not now,
when, right?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.166
(both chuckling)

16:39.199 --> 16:40.433
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Quick, Jane,

16:40.467 --> 16:41.801
think of something to say.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.471
Uh, so,
you're an accountant, right?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.273
I am, indeed.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.675
And how long have you
been doing that for?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.577
Five years.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.345
No, six.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.115
No, wait, five.
Definitely five.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.816
Five. Great.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.387
And, uh, if you weren't
an accountant...

17:00.420 --> 17:01.654
You know what, six!

17:01.688 --> 17:03.356
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Thought he
was good with numbers.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.691
Six. Got it.

17:04.724 --> 17:05.892
And if you
weren't an accountant,

17:05.925 --> 17:09.262
and you could have any job
in the world, what would it be?

17:09.296 --> 17:11.364
You know, I actually like
being an accountant.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.766
It's steady, consistent--

17:13.800 --> 17:15.668
I don't like a lot of drama.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.737
DIRECTOR: This is the most
dramatic scene

17:17.770 --> 17:19.339
in the whole telenovela.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.707
I know!
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, thank God.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.509
I was starting to fall asleep.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.444
But I cannot find
the truth in it.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.846
And finding the truth
is very important

17:26.879 --> 17:28.581
to my journey as an actor.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.350
The truth is that
you're saying good-bye

17:30.383 --> 17:32.685
to the kidney stone that has
been your steadfast companion

17:32.719 --> 17:34.287
for your journey

17:34.321 --> 17:35.722
down the lady scientist's
urinary tract.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.459
Come on, this is our
big Cast Away rip-off.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.630
Homage.
And I'm just having trouble

17:43.663 --> 17:45.365
connecting with
the good-bye speech.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.600
Well, I'm sure you'll
find it on the day.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.436
That's lunch.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.874
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, you'll recall

17:54.907 --> 17:58.278
Ro and Esteban recently had
a relationship breakthrough.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.480
I hate him.
Stay calm.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.714
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, it didn't last.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.150
ESTEBAN:
Hi, guys.

18:03.183 --> 18:07.154
I call this the Bond and Tone.

18:07.187 --> 18:10.157
Keeps me fit and firm,
and puts Baby right down.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.492
Well, she's going to wake up
when you transfer her.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.727
Oh, don't worry,
I have this down to a science.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.863
Yes.

18:16.896 --> 18:20.467
I just take to child
rearing so naturally.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.536
In fact, Darci and I are already
talking about number two.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.272
The only number two you're
having is in the bathroom.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.240
You never had a number one.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.708
Hey, Esteban,

18:28.741 --> 18:30.810
what if Darci didn't
want another kid?

18:30.843 --> 18:33.413
Oh, well, of course,
it's up to her.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.515
Whatever Darci desires.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.683
Wow.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.385
Sounds like you'd
do anything for her.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.387
Of course.
If she is happy,

18:40.420 --> 18:42.155
I am happy.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.492
Very clever.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.493
Just proving a point.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.895
Would snipping me really
make you happy, Xiomara?

18:48.928 --> 18:50.863
It would.

18:50.897 --> 18:54.334
And I think it would
make you happy, too.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.470
Are you not wearing a bra?

18:57.504 --> 18:58.905
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Looks like someone's taking

18:58.938 --> 19:01.241
her mother's advice.
I must have forgotten.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.775
Mm.
It's funny.
I didn't realize

19:02.809 --> 19:05.445
how much the fear
of getting pregnant

19:05.478 --> 19:08.681
was holding me
back, sexually.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.317
Go on.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.219
Well, maybe it's silly,

19:12.252 --> 19:17.390
but I feel like once that tiny
bit of fear is lifted,

19:17.424 --> 19:20.527
I'll be able to
fully express myself.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.563
Mm.
And it would be
so simple, really.

19:23.596 --> 19:27.467
Just snip, snip.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.668
Boom.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.537
All right, make the appointment.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.571
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Boom.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.977
(gasps)

19:38.010 --> 19:39.512
Are you okay?

19:39.546 --> 19:41.514
My laptop fell,
I-I didn't mean to wake you.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.717
(groans)

19:44.751 --> 19:47.220
It's-it's okay.
I'm fine.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.821
I'm fine.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.457
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, again,

19:50.490 --> 19:52.392
there was so much to say,

19:52.425 --> 19:54.227
but that wasn't
Jane's role anymore.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.562
Then why aren't you asleep?

19:55.595 --> 19:58.431
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But she didn't care.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.900
What is it?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.769
Rafael...

20:04.604 --> 20:08.475
I don't... I don't know,
I just feel, um...

20:10.577 --> 20:11.744
...lost.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.613
I keep replaying
everything

20:13.646 --> 20:16.649
in my mind that happened,

20:16.683 --> 20:20.387
and how I got here.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.355
I mean, she ran me over.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.392
And then I think about
the hotel, you know.

20:25.425 --> 20:29.696
And the money-- like, what
if it's all really gone?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.564
But then I get mad
at myself because

20:31.598 --> 20:33.600
then I sound like my
father-- or my ex-father.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.668
And then I know I shouldn't
even be thinking that

20:35.702 --> 20:38.538
because I'm lucky
to be alive.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.774
And I know that.
(sniffles)

20:41.808 --> 20:43.276
I'm lucky.

20:46.979 --> 20:50.750
It's okay to not feel lucky.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.621
You shouldn't even
be talking to me.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.990
Hey, you're family.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.494
Family shows up.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.532
Plus, you know I love you.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.766
Not romantically.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.801
(laughs, sniffles)

21:08.835 --> 21:12.672
You think I should, um,
just give it all up?

21:12.705 --> 21:14.974
Just forget about the...

21:15.007 --> 21:17.844
the trust and the hotel
and just start over?

21:17.877 --> 21:20.513
It doesn't matter
what I think.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.849
I think that I have to.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.986
Uh, you can, you can
go back to bed now.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.921
I know.

21:43.069 --> 21:45.405
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah,
friends, we left with change

21:45.438 --> 21:47.340
upon the horizon.
Is that better?

21:47.374 --> 21:52.845
Yes. So, I prepared a few
questions about the...

21:52.879 --> 21:55.014
Castration?
...procedure.

21:55.047 --> 21:58.718
First, you've worked on
other celebrity penises?

21:58.751 --> 22:02.422
Yes. I've done vasectomies
for many other celebrities.
Who?

22:02.455 --> 22:05.825
I can't say specifically,
but, uh, pretty big stars.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.895
More or less famous
than Michael Douglas?

22:08.928 --> 22:11.631
Exactly as famous
as Michael Douglas.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.603
The snipping, is it painful?

22:16.636 --> 22:17.970
Not at all.
We use a local anesthetic.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.972
What if I change my mind?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.141
The procedure is totally
reversible and, of course,

22:22.174 --> 22:23.976
this will make things
much easier for your wife.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.845
That's why I'm here.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.914
She already had her
life derailed by Baby.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.081
Oh, you had a baby.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.783
Yes, my baby Baby.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.685
XIOMARA:
Just continue.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.655
I want to do this for you.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.789
Great.

22:36.823 --> 22:40.092
But I just don't think I can.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.662
(sighs)

22:42.695 --> 22:43.996
NARRATOR: Also having trouble
pulling the trigger...

22:44.030 --> 22:45.498
Oh, Jane.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.799
Here you are.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.967
Finally.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.469
What did you think?

22:49.502 --> 22:51.738
Hmm?
About Danny.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.506
Just tell Lina
that Danny is great

22:53.540 --> 22:55.542
and you're completely on board
with the two of them.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.977
He's great. I'm completely
on board. Marry him.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.812
Yeah? What-what made
you think that?

22:59.846 --> 23:03.416
Well, he's-he's
really interesting

23:03.450 --> 23:08.421
and smart and he clearly
loves you so much.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.458
So you have
absolutely no doubts?

23:11.491 --> 23:12.625
Yes.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.793
You hesitated.
I didn't.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.496
Lady, give it to me. Now.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.699
Okay, look...

23:19.732 --> 23:21.934
it was a little hard
to find a groove with him,

23:21.968 --> 23:23.636
you know, conversationally.

23:23.670 --> 23:24.804
Because he's boring!

23:24.837 --> 23:26.639
I knew it!
I didn't say "boring."

23:26.673 --> 23:27.807
NARRATOR:
Well, not exactly.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.476
Oh, my God.

23:29.509 --> 23:30.510
What was I thinking?

23:30.543 --> 23:32.044
We are complete opposites.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.781
I should be with
someone sexy

23:34.814 --> 23:37.450
and edgy and bisexual,
like Adam.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.885
Do you think I should
call off the wedding?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.052
No.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.154
I talked to the guy
for 30 minutes.

23:42.188 --> 23:45.725
A-And it's not about me,
Lina, or your sisters.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.094
It's about you.
How do you feel?

23:48.127 --> 23:49.829
LUISA:
How do I feel?

23:49.862 --> 23:51.931
Bad, Carl. Bad.

23:51.964 --> 23:52.865
You were supposed
to help me

23:52.899 --> 23:55.635
get the money,
which I still don't have,

23:55.668 --> 23:58.838
and my ex-brother just
keeps lying and scheming.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.173
Well, throw something else,
then. Let it out.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.942
Good idea.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.613
(glass shatters)

24:06.646 --> 24:08.581
How long has this been going on?

24:08.615 --> 24:09.749
Awhile.
(glass shattering)

24:09.782 --> 24:11.183
And there's something else.

24:13.653 --> 24:14.687
Spare me the dramatic pause.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.256
Last week, I overheard
Magda and Anezka talking.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.026
Dr. Luisa introduce me
to her friend Carl,

24:20.059 --> 24:22.028
but there was no one there.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.697
She just be talking
to the air.

24:24.731 --> 24:27.767
Are you absolutely sure
they said "Carl"?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.837
(glass shattering)

24:30.870 --> 24:32.872
I have to go.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.206
(phone dialing)

24:34.240 --> 24:35.908
Carl?

24:35.942 --> 24:37.109
Are you sure?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.778
That's what Krishna said.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.648
I just thought you should know.
(glass shatters)

24:43.683 --> 24:44.884
What's happening?

24:44.917 --> 24:45.785
Who's Carl?

24:45.818 --> 24:47.954
Do you remember when
I told you that Luisa

24:47.987 --> 24:51.791
had a, had a nervous breakdown
during her medical residency?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.793
Mm-hmm.
Well, she went
into a psychosis

24:53.826 --> 24:56.896
and said that
someone named Carla

24:56.929 --> 24:58.297
told her she had
to barge into surgeries,

24:58.330 --> 24:59.866
take over and save lives.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.233
But there was no Carla.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.236
It was a hallucination.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.906
And she didn't believe
anyone but me.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.107
(sighs) I got
to talk to her.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.876
Try to get her
to accept help.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.212
See? You show up, too.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.650
ROGELIO:
Wow.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.151
You are a sight for sore eyes.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.654
Thanks for the costume.
Of course.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.322
And I'm sorry
I'm working tonight.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.324
A-And I'm also sorry
about the procedure.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.793
I-I really wanted
to do it for you.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.161
Don't say that.
But it's true.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.864
It's not or you'd just
get over your machismo.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.299
It's not machismo.

25:33.332 --> 25:34.366
It is.
It's not.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.904
Then what is it?
I'm turning into
an old man, Xo!

25:40.973 --> 25:42.108
It's true.

25:43.976 --> 25:47.847
I have gray hairs
and things sag.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.349
I'm in the makeup chair
longer every day

25:50.382 --> 25:52.251
and no matter what I do,
it's just happening.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.753
I can't stop it.

25:55.054 --> 25:59.258
And this...
just feels like...

25:59.291 --> 26:01.894
I don't know, like I'm
moving onto the next stage,

26:01.928 --> 26:04.563
the old man stage...

26:06.098 --> 26:08.134
...which, I know,
sounds silly.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.770
It doesn't.
It actually makes sense.

26:10.803 --> 26:14.607
Really? Because I was kind
of hoping you'd tell me

26:14.641 --> 26:17.343
I'm still the same hot, young
stud you met 28 years ago.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.311
You are to me.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.280
And you always will be.

26:22.982 --> 26:26.653
Don't worry
about the vasectomy.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.688
I'll figure something out.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.958
Did you figure out
your costume?

26:31.991 --> 26:34.026
Did he ever.
He was trying it on
for me last night,

26:34.060 --> 26:36.328
posing like no
one's business.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.864
(laughs)

26:37.897 --> 26:40.032
(sultry music playing)

26:40.066 --> 26:42.234
*

26:44.036 --> 26:46.973
(laughs) All right, later, guys.
I'm late for work.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.809
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
No, Jane, don't ask.

26:49.842 --> 26:50.877
What?

26:50.910 --> 26:52.979
Nothing.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.981
Were you wondering if
I hooked up with him?

26:55.014 --> 26:56.683
Say no.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.350
I was. I'm sorry.
Seriously?

26:58.384 --> 27:00.319
I'm sorry. It's just...
That you can't deal.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.988
I'm trying.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.656
It's throwing me.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.057
Obviously.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.926
But I think it's
because you didn't give me

27:06.959 --> 27:08.260
a chance to react.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.929
You immediately said
that people acted weird,

27:09.962 --> 27:12.131
which meant that
I couldn't act weird.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.933
Well, don't worry. You did.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.935
But that's why.
Maybe.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.904
Or maybe I was right.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.172
Once you knew,
things would change.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.408
Don't you have
to meet Danny

27:22.441 --> 27:23.776
with the rest of
that party stuff?

27:23.810 --> 27:25.778
Yeah.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.681
I'll see you tonight?

27:28.715 --> 27:30.817
Maybe.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.988
Ah!

27:36.022 --> 27:37.824
Hi. I am so sorry I'm late.

27:37.857 --> 27:38.958
Traffic was awful.
No problem.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.160
Hey, have you talked
to Lina lately?

27:41.193 --> 27:43.930
Something seems off.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You mean besides the fact

27:43.963 --> 27:45.297
that she's not sure
she should marry you?

27:45.331 --> 27:48.000
Really?
S-She seems fine to me.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.201
No, I can tell
something's wrong.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.138
She isn't talking as much.
And our waitress this morning

27:52.171 --> 27:55.041
had really bad highlights,
and she didn't say anything

27:55.074 --> 27:57.276
and you know how sensitive
Lina is to bad highlights.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.979
That's totally true.
My guess is

28:00.012 --> 28:01.781
she's unhappy about
the murder mystery theme,

28:01.814 --> 28:03.883
which I knew
she wouldn't be that into.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.251
Y-You did?

28:05.284 --> 28:07.720
Yeah, but I thought
it would be a great cover

28:07.754 --> 28:11.023
'cause I also know as much as
she hates murder mysteries,

28:11.057 --> 28:13.225
she loves surprises.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.094
And I have a really
big one planned.

28:15.127 --> 28:17.129
Y-You do?

28:17.163 --> 28:18.164
My groomsmen and
I are planning

28:18.197 --> 28:20.332
a little something
that's more Lina

28:20.366 --> 28:21.768
once the murder
mystery is solved.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.069
There will be glitter,

28:23.102 --> 28:25.772
penises, cake-- ooh,
and a striptease.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.073
Oh.
By me.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.008
Wow.
(laughs)

28:29.041 --> 28:31.944
You know Lina really well.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.814
W-Why would you think
I didn't know Lina?

28:34.847 --> 28:36.115
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.016
(blows raspberry)
No reason.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.084
Did Lina say that?

28:38.117 --> 28:39.251
That I didn't know her?

28:39.285 --> 28:41.087
Is that why she's
been acting so weird?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.054
That's it, isn't it?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.056
No, no. I-I'm the one
that said something.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.524
What?

28:45.557 --> 28:49.095
I told Lina that I had doubts
about your compatibility

28:49.128 --> 28:50.997
because of our kind of
awkward conversation.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.465
That conversation was awkward
because you were asking me

28:53.499 --> 28:56.035
all these strange questions
and I was trying to be polite

28:56.068 --> 28:57.837
because I wanted
to make a good impression

28:57.870 --> 28:59.839
on my fiancée's
overprotective friend.

28:59.872 --> 29:02.541
Whatever, uh-- I'll
see you at the party.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.911
Well...

29:04.944 --> 29:08.080
Yeah, looks like Danny does
bring the drama after all.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.586
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Prepare, friends,

29:14.620 --> 29:17.489
for a night of mystery, drama,
and some very fine acting.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.391
(woman screams)

29:19.425 --> 29:22.094
(with cockney accent):
Oh, no!

29:22.128 --> 29:23.495
Ladies and gents,

29:23.529 --> 29:27.033
chaps and birds,
I've most dismaying news.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.400
Ignacio de Lorenzo
of Seville,

29:28.434 --> 29:31.337
the most celebrated
matador in all of España

29:31.370 --> 29:33.105
and honored guest of our host,

29:33.139 --> 29:34.773
the Duke...

29:41.380 --> 29:43.049
...has been found dead...

29:43.082 --> 29:44.116
(people gasp, scream)

29:44.150 --> 29:46.118
...in the manor's maze garden!

29:46.152 --> 29:47.419
(gasps)
And what's worse,

29:47.453 --> 29:50.222
the murderer is among us.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.590
(people gasp)

29:51.623 --> 29:53.893
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, so nice to be investigating

29:53.926 --> 29:56.228
a pretend murder
at the Marbella for once.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.464
Okay, we need
to talk real quick.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.900
(with French accent): We are
supposed to stay in character.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.234
Oui, Clara?

30:04.603 --> 30:06.572
(with cockney accent):
That's right, Renée.

30:09.608 --> 30:14.280
I was 100% wrong about Danny
and you should 100% marry him.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.382
It's all good, old chap.

30:16.415 --> 30:21.954
Okay. So, then, why is he
shooting you the death glare?

30:26.625 --> 30:28.460
(normal voice): Because he
found out about the sussing.

30:28.494 --> 30:29.962
What?
(cockney accent):
No, but it's fine.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.297
I said it was my idea.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.965
He thinks you had
nothing to do with it

30:32.999 --> 30:34.100
and the important thing is

30:34.133 --> 30:35.634
is that you're perfect
for each other

30:35.667 --> 30:38.905
and I can't wait to come
to your wedding, old chap.

30:38.938 --> 30:39.906
Really?

30:39.939 --> 30:42.474
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:42.508 --> 30:44.610
a suspect has emerged.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.612
There's apparently a lunatic

30:46.645 --> 30:48.480
from the asylum on the loose.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.649
No. You're wrong.

30:50.682 --> 30:51.984
Carl is not like Carla.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.019
Carl is real.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.921
He's not.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.122
Think about it, Luisa.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.656
No one's seen him but you.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.992
Because he has to keep
his identity a secret.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.963
I know how that sounds,

31:03.996 --> 31:05.631
but there is someone else
who's seen him.

31:05.664 --> 31:06.899
Anezka.

31:06.933 --> 31:07.934
She didn't.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.335
Krishna overheard
Anezka saying

31:09.368 --> 31:11.403
that no one was there.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.972
You were alone.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.640
Oh, good. You're together.

31:14.673 --> 31:17.043
Hopefully not trashing me
at my own bachelor party.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.510
Of course not.
I wouldn't say of course.

31:18.544 --> 31:19.645
Danny, stop.
Sorry, I'm mad.
It's fine.

31:19.678 --> 31:22.548
Danny.
I overstepped.
She was trying to break us up.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.683
No, she wasn't.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.920
I asked Jane if she thought
we should get married.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.956
It's not true.
It's not. Carl is real

31:29.989 --> 31:31.223
and this is one
of your lies.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.125
He's not, Luisa.
He has blue eyes

31:33.159 --> 31:35.627
and a peppered beard
and he uses an inhaler.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.696
This is your mind
playing tricks on you.
No!

31:37.729 --> 31:39.065
I don't believe you.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.066
I don't believe this.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.167
You don't want to marry me?

31:44.003 --> 31:44.703
Lina.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.272
Carl?

31:46.305 --> 31:48.307
Carl?!

31:48.340 --> 31:49.308
Lina, answer.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.110
Please, Carl, answer.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.044
Yes?

31:52.078 --> 31:53.579
I don't know.

31:56.182 --> 31:57.283
What should I do?

31:57.316 --> 31:58.584
MAN:
Proof!

31:58.617 --> 32:00.152
I demand proof!

32:00.186 --> 32:03.555
We haven't always seen eye
to eye, but I trust you.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.091
So, I'm asking you

32:05.124 --> 32:07.693
to tell me the truth.

32:07.726 --> 32:10.629
You see Carl here, right?

32:10.662 --> 32:12.198
Uh...

32:12.231 --> 32:13.365
Anezka?

32:13.399 --> 32:15.067
No.

32:15.101 --> 32:18.337
I am sorry, Dr. Luisa,
there is no one there.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.006
Carl, say something.

32:20.039 --> 32:23.742
Well, it doesn't matter if
I'm real to her, Luisa.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.710
I'm real to you.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.712
You hear that, right?

32:26.745 --> 32:28.214
Anezka,

32:28.247 --> 32:29.248
come on, he's
right here!

32:29.281 --> 32:31.650
Okay, beautiful doctor.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.086
Uh, hello to you, Carl.

32:34.120 --> 32:38.357
Uh, I am loving
your sweater.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.993
He's right over here and
he's wearing a T-shirt.

32:41.027 --> 32:44.196
Okay, you just tell me
what I see.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.331
No. I...

32:45.364 --> 32:47.199
I don't understand.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.368
If you can't see Carl,
why didn't you say anything

32:49.401 --> 32:51.070
the other night
outside the hotel?

32:51.103 --> 32:55.641
Because I did not want to
embarrass beautiful doctor.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.544
(sighs)

32:58.577 --> 33:00.779
(sniffles)

33:00.812 --> 33:02.781
What's wrong with me?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.351
Nothing, I promise,
you're just scared.

33:05.384 --> 33:08.120
Because he's just not
who I pictured myself with.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.588
So what?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.123
He's who you fell for.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.525
And he has so many
amazing qualities.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.760
I know.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.495
But I shouldn't
have these doubts

33:16.528 --> 33:17.629
if I'm marrying him,
right?

33:17.663 --> 33:20.132
Everyone has doubts.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.367
Did you,
with Michael?

33:23.235 --> 33:25.537
There's just so much we haven't
talked about, basic stuff.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.473
Marriage stuff. Tomorrow's
just the wedding.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.640
And the rehearsal
was a disaster.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.775
What if tomorrow's awful?

33:29.808 --> 33:31.543
Huge doubts.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.112
We made a list,
actually.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.546
A very long list

33:34.580 --> 33:36.448
of all the things that
we needed to discuss.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.051
Danny loves lists.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.052
He makes them
constantly.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.154
Aw, a man after
my own heart.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.090
He even has phone alerts

33:44.123 --> 33:45.657
to remind him to do
what's on the lists.

33:45.691 --> 33:46.792
How have I not
thought of that?

33:46.825 --> 33:48.026
NARRATOR:
And friends, that's when

33:48.060 --> 33:51.163
Lina suddenly realized the role
Danny played in her life.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.299
Oh, my God.
What?

33:53.332 --> 33:55.801
I'm marrying
the male version of you.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.169
(laughs)

33:57.203 --> 34:01.473
I mean,
Danny is organized and smart

34:01.507 --> 34:03.142
and responsible
and kind of nerdy.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.310
I mean, he's you!

34:04.343 --> 34:06.278
(giggles)

34:06.312 --> 34:09.081
And you're the longest
relationship that I've ever had.

34:09.115 --> 34:12.251
Aw, you're the longest
relationship I've ever had.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.652
I love you, Jane.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.754
I love you, too.

34:15.787 --> 34:18.157
(sultry music playing)

34:24.763 --> 34:26.298
What the hell?
Huh?

34:27.333 --> 34:29.435
Were you gonna kiss me?

34:29.468 --> 34:30.869
(laughs):
What?

34:30.902 --> 34:33.405
No. Don't be ridiculous.

34:33.439 --> 34:34.440
I mean...

34:35.674 --> 34:37.109
Yeah, I was.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.544
Oh...

34:46.218 --> 34:47.353
I'm sorry, I don't know
what I was thinking.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.221
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Seemed like you were thinking

34:49.255 --> 34:50.822
of making out
with your best friend.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.625
I guess I'm still
a little freaked out

34:53.659 --> 34:56.562
by Adam's big
bisexuality reveal.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.397
Well, a pretty smart friend
once told me

34:58.430 --> 34:59.831
that you fall for
who you fall for.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.900
Yeah, but this
is different.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.336
I'm not freaked out
by his sexuality,

35:04.370 --> 35:06.272
I'm freaked out that
he kept it from me.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.707
Hmm.
What?

35:08.740 --> 35:11.577
As your best friend
in the world

35:11.610 --> 35:13.312
and the person
you just tried to make out with,

35:13.345 --> 35:14.480
that's a bunch a crap.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.582
Excuse me?

35:16.615 --> 35:19.251
Don't try to make this
about him hiding.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.553
Figure out what's
really going on.

35:21.587 --> 35:25.524
Oh... well, I-I guess
it's because...

35:25.557 --> 35:28.494
Lady? Tell him.

35:28.527 --> 35:29.395
Not me.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.463
Because it's my freaking
bachelorette party

35:31.497 --> 35:33.532
and I need to go
tell my fiancé

35:33.565 --> 35:34.800
that I can't wait
to marry him.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.902
Go! Go!
(gasps) Okay.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.770
Mwah.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.906
Any more and you
couldn't handle it.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.541
(Lina giggles)

35:43.809 --> 35:45.677
(Jane laughs)

35:52.684 --> 35:54.220
Did you buy it?

35:54.253 --> 35:56.422
Uh, sure?

35:56.455 --> 35:57.489
Of course you didn't,

35:57.523 --> 36:00.626
because I'm talking to
a Styrofoam kidney stone!

36:00.659 --> 36:02.661
Aren't you supposed to, like...

36:02.694 --> 36:04.630
pretend it's something else?

36:04.663 --> 36:06.232
You know?

36:06.265 --> 36:07.899
Something that
means something to you?

36:07.933 --> 36:10.536
DIRECTOR: All right, this scene
moves us to the next stage.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.637
(bell rings)

36:11.670 --> 36:12.338
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And friends,

36:12.371 --> 36:13.872
it was one of those moments

36:13.905 --> 36:15.774
when art and life
come together.

36:15.807 --> 36:19.711
Suddenly, Rogelio knew exactly
how to access that emotion.

36:58.750 --> 36:59.751
Cut!

36:59.785 --> 37:01.920
(bell rings)
How dare you!

37:01.953 --> 37:03.755
I was in the moment!
DIRECTOR: I know,

37:03.789 --> 37:05.424
and it was fantastic.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.626
It's just that
your eye line was off.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.861
It kind of looked like you were
talking to your penis.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.464
(laughs):
Really?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.836
Well, just go again.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.739
Danny and I just had
the hottest sex.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.674
(laughs)
Oh...

37:22.708 --> 37:24.276
I've never done it
in a bathroom before.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.711
At the Marbella.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.347
At my own bachelorette party.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.749
(giggles)
(laughs)

37:30.782 --> 37:33.018
(lively music plays)

37:33.051 --> 37:35.521
*

37:35.554 --> 37:37.389
Oh, my God.
(women cheering, whistling)

37:38.724 --> 37:40.359
That's my man.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.628
(whistles)
(whoops)

37:46.432 --> 37:48.867
You look like
you're having fun.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.536
Yeah, can I go?

37:50.569 --> 37:51.737
Your dad just texted.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.405
He's getting snipped.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.640
No more pulling out...

37:54.673 --> 37:56.775
Ma, again with
the pulling out.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.778
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right,
this time I'm pulling out.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.648
Can we talk?

38:03.949 --> 38:05.684
So, yeah.

38:05.717 --> 38:08.354
It wasn't that you waited
a long time to tell me.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.855
It was what you told me.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.758
Which became pretty clear
after I tried to kiss Lina.

38:12.791 --> 38:13.759
What?

38:13.792 --> 38:16.928
I know. It was a momentary
lapse of judgment.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.097
But you're obviously right.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.767
I did freak out.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.935
I guess I-I...

38:23.969 --> 38:24.970
I just have questions.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.373
Which are silly and stupid...

38:27.406 --> 38:29.341
No. Ask me.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.979
Is being bisexual a stop?

38:34.012 --> 38:36.382
O-On your way to
coming out as gay?

38:36.415 --> 38:37.849
Definitely not.

38:37.883 --> 38:40.519
Um, it just means that
I'm open to a connection

38:40.552 --> 38:41.820
with a man or a women.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.689
What else you got?

38:43.722 --> 38:46.858
Well, I guess I feel a
little insecure, you know.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.428
It's not like I can give
you what a man can.

38:49.461 --> 38:52.030
Well, yeah,
you're right, you can't.

38:52.063 --> 38:55.434
But you can't give me what other
women can give me, either.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.504
But it doesn't matter, because
I choose to be with you.

38:58.537 --> 38:59.905
I don't want to be
with anyone else,

38:59.938 --> 39:02.073
regardless of gender.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.509
Really?

39:03.542 --> 39:04.710
Yeah, really.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.745
We're in
a monogamous relationship.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.815
Which means that you're not
allowed to kiss anyone else.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.518
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.753
If it makes you feel any better,
she hard core rejected me.

39:14.786 --> 39:15.787
Well, then she's an idiot.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.122
(giggles)

39:18.457 --> 39:20.091
(both moaning)

39:20.125 --> 39:21.727
Oh, Bob...

39:21.760 --> 39:24.162
(laughs)
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.764
It's Jim, right?
(laughs): Yeah.

39:25.797 --> 39:26.832
LUISA:
This is Mark.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.704
You see Mark, right?

39:32.738 --> 39:35.106
Yes.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.942
What are you doing here?

39:36.975 --> 39:42.614
I'm checking myself
into a psychiatric hospital.

39:42.648 --> 39:45.484
Or a wellness center
if you believe the brochure.

39:45.517 --> 39:46.952
*

39:46.985 --> 39:49.555
I can't go down this path again.

39:51.590 --> 39:55.527
Well, I'm... really glad
that you're getting help.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.896
After everything
that's happened,

39:57.929 --> 40:01.132
the fact that...

40:01.166 --> 40:04.002
you're still looking out
for me, it...

40:07.172 --> 40:09.575
Thank you.

40:09.608 --> 40:12.143
And you can have
your hotel shares back.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.545
What?

40:14.946 --> 40:16.815
That's not why I helped you.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.950
I know.

40:18.984 --> 40:21.419
That's why I'm giving them back.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.065
Hey, you.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.736
Everything okay?

40:37.769 --> 40:38.837
Yeah.

40:38.870 --> 40:39.838
(sighs)

40:43.208 --> 40:44.810
Luisa's going to get help.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.178
That's great.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.616
And she's giving me back
my hotel shares.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.019
What?
Yeah.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.187
She's giving everything back.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.725
See?

40:59.758 --> 41:02.628
You do the right thing
and good things happen.

41:02.661 --> 41:03.962
(laughs softly)

41:03.995 --> 41:05.196
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, Jane,

41:05.230 --> 41:07.165
after all your
telenovela watching,

41:07.198 --> 41:09.935
you should know by now,
that's not true.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.103
I know it's not how you
wanted to get the hotel back,

41:12.137 --> 41:14.973
but it's still a good thing.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.274
My sister signed this
last night.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.711
All the shares
are now back in my name.

41:19.745 --> 41:23.148
Oh, well, unfortunately, due
to your sister's mental state,

41:23.181 --> 41:25.817
she's not allowed to change
any contractual agreement.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.653
What does that mean?
It reverts

41:27.686 --> 41:29.621
to the original agreement
she signed six weeks ago,

41:29.655 --> 41:32.558
which stated in the event
of her incapacitation,

41:32.591 --> 41:33.859
all her hotel
shares go to...

41:33.892 --> 41:36.027
I am new owner of Marbella!

41:36.061 --> 41:38.196
Good job, Anton.

41:40.732 --> 41:43.535
We did it.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.270
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I did tell you

41:45.303 --> 41:47.505
there would be some
very fine acting.
