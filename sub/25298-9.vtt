00:34.825 --> 00:36.917
[Bill and kids] Wowwwww!

00:36.917 --> 00:39.920
[Cricket] We didn't have
restaurants like this
back in the country!

00:39.920 --> 00:42.713
I don't like it.
Feels too city-fied!

00:42.713 --> 00:43.754
That's the point!

00:43.754 --> 00:45.335
I figured we'd all enjoy

00:45.335 --> 00:47.628
a genuine Big City
dining experience!

00:47.628 --> 00:50.050
Plus I've got a gift card,
so it's free!

00:50.050 --> 00:51.341
Niiiiice.

00:51.341 --> 00:52.843
Hi there!
Welcome to Sea Fusion!

00:52.843 --> 00:54.514
-Howdy!
-Ooh!

00:54.514 --> 00:56.266
Where are you all
visiting from?

00:56.266 --> 00:57.477
Visiting from?

00:57.477 --> 00:59.309
[chuckles] Oh, no,
we live here.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.771
And we'll die here, too!

01:00.771 --> 01:02.182
Cricket, please.

01:02.182 --> 01:03.854
Alrighty then,
if you'll follow me,

01:03.854 --> 01:05.355
I've got a table
for you.

01:05.355 --> 01:07.688
What the heck kinda food
is sea fusion?

01:07.688 --> 01:11.241
It's takin' two different types
of food and blendin' them
together to make one.

01:11.241 --> 01:13.824
Like if you put
an egg on a donut?

01:13.824 --> 01:15.035
Yeah, but with fish.

01:15.035 --> 01:16.997
[gasps] I want it!

01:16.997 --> 01:18.328
Here you are.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.830
[all straining]

01:19.830 --> 01:21.251
Here are your menus,

01:21.251 --> 01:23.203
and your waiter
will be with you shortly.

01:23.203 --> 01:25.165
[Bill and kids]
Ooooooh!

01:25.165 --> 01:27.918
I'm gonna order the craziest,
wackiest thing here!

01:27.918 --> 01:29.469
That won't be hard.
It's all garbage!

01:29.469 --> 01:31.211
[man] Ow!

01:31.211 --> 01:34.264
What kind of restaurant
doesn't serve pizza?!

01:34.264 --> 01:36.306
They do! In smoothie form!

01:36.306 --> 01:39.099
See? The Shrimpy-
Pizzy Smoothie.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.561
Yuh! Pizza's for eatin',
not drinkin'!

01:41.561 --> 01:42.813
Huh?

01:42.813 --> 01:44.314
What the...

01:44.314 --> 01:47.067
Where have I seen
that trident before?

01:47.067 --> 01:48.318
Good evening, folks.

01:48.318 --> 01:50.280
Have you decided
on what you'd like to order?

01:50.280 --> 01:52.532
Yes, I think I'll have
the fish and chips.

01:52.532 --> 01:55.786
Ah, yes, a popular dish
for tourists.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.038
No, now ya see,
I'm not a tourist.

01:58.038 --> 01:59.910
I<i> live</i> in Big City.

01:59.910 --> 02:01.792
Oh, really?

02:01.792 --> 02:04.584
Then in that case,
you should order what
all the locals order.

02:04.584 --> 02:07.047
The Seafusion Tsunami!

02:07.047 --> 02:10.300
A 12-course meal
of our most creative
sea-fusions.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.884
Well, then, as a<i> local,
</i>I will have that.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.306
Very well.
And for you, sweetie?

02:16.306 --> 02:18.598
I will have
the Seahorse Salad.

02:18.598 --> 02:21.471
And I'll have
the phony baloney
or whatever.

02:21.471 --> 02:22.813
Ah, fantastic.

02:22.813 --> 02:24.815
Our phony baloney comes
with two sides.

02:24.815 --> 02:26.266
-Gaaaagh!
-Listen, buddy.

02:26.266 --> 02:27.938
I'm gonna shoot
straight with you here.

02:27.938 --> 02:30.440
The stuff on the menu
looks a bit tame.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.192
I'm lookin'
for somethin' wild.

02:32.192 --> 02:33.573
Off menu. You follow?

02:33.573 --> 02:35.035
Oh, I follow.

02:35.035 --> 02:36.947
Janine?

02:36.947 --> 02:38.739
This gentleman
will be having
the Sea Monster Burger.

02:38.739 --> 02:40.450
[gasps] Mm-hmm.

02:40.450 --> 02:42.162
I'll be back
with your drinks.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.954
Did you guys hear that?!
A sea monster!

02:43.954 --> 02:45.375
Soon to be in my tummy!

02:45.375 --> 02:47.627
That's it! I remember!

02:47.627 --> 02:50.050
I knew that trident
looked familiar.

02:50.050 --> 02:51.962
It was mine!

02:51.962 --> 02:54.384
-[thunder]
<i> -Back when I was
sailing abroad,</i>

02:54.384 --> 02:59.179

02:59.179 --> 03:01.391
Until those protesters
made us stop.

03:01.391 --> 03:03.764
After that, it went missin'.

03:03.764 --> 03:06.266
You all enjoy
your dinner of wackadoo.

03:06.266 --> 03:07.607
I'm gonna go get it back!

03:07.607 --> 03:09.309
Ma, please don't
cause a scene.

03:09.309 --> 03:11.311
Here's
your first course, sir.

03:11.311 --> 03:12.312
Our sushi starter.

03:12.312 --> 03:14.444
And here
are your chopsticks.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.697
As a local, surely you know
how to use chopsticks.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.818
Don't you?

03:17.818 --> 03:19.369
Oh. Uhh... ha ha!

03:19.369 --> 03:21.161
Of course! Thank you!

03:23.874 --> 03:25.455
Ow!

03:25.455 --> 03:27.878
Sir? I see
you're having trouble.

03:27.878 --> 03:29.960

we do provide a service.

chopstick professionals

your food into your mouth.

03:34.334 --> 03:35.966
It's a big hit
with the tourists.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.888
I think I'll be just fine
on my own, thank you.

03:37.888 --> 03:39.679
Of course!

03:41.301 --> 03:44.434
[grunting]

03:44.434 --> 03:45.645
Ha! I did it!

03:45.645 --> 03:47.397
Not too bad, eh?

03:47.397 --> 03:49.149
[groaning]

03:49.149 --> 03:52.482
Many tourists are put off
by the bitter jellyfish jelly,

03:52.482 --> 03:54.404
but not us locals,
right? [chuckles]

03:54.404 --> 03:56.026
Mmmmmm!

Fantastic! I'll get

Here's your meal.

-I hope you enjoy your...

Well,
I wanted to get wild.

04:13.173 --> 04:14.584
So let's get wild.

04:14.584 --> 04:16.006
Sorry, fella.
Nothin' personal.

04:17.427 --> 04:19.009
Hm. Now let me see.

to do this?

04:51.081 --> 04:53.503
You've lost a meal,
but you've gained a friend.

04:53.503 --> 04:55.375
I shall call him Ringo.

or dad or ex-girlfriend!

sneak up and take it back,

Whoa there!
So sorry, ma'am!

05:18.698 --> 05:20.700
But our decor is not meant
to be played with.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.442
However, if you're
craving some fun,

05:22.442 --> 05:25.285
we do offer
some table-side
entertainment!

05:25.285 --> 05:29.039
-[egg sizzling]
-[patrons] Ooh! Ahh!

05:29.039 --> 05:30.831
Meh... Whatever...

05:33.083 --> 05:34.504
Oh, boy.

05:34.504 --> 05:35.795
All right,
up next we have

05:35.795 --> 05:38.879
our famous whole-wheat,
whole-fish taco.

05:38.879 --> 05:41.461
Wow, it really is
an entire fish.

05:41.461 --> 05:43.423
Uh-uh. Hold on.

05:43.423 --> 05:46.466
We're supposed to cover it
in our traditional
fish-milk powder.

05:46.466 --> 05:48.268
Who doesn't love fish-milk?

05:48.268 --> 05:49.559
Ahh...

05:51.231 --> 05:53.023
Oh, yeah. I love it.

05:53.023 --> 05:56.686
[Ted] Your next course,
our famous spagett-eel.

05:56.686 --> 05:58.608
Just like Mom used to make.

05:58.608 --> 06:02.442
[Ted] Our blow fish will
surely blow you away.

06:02.442 --> 06:03.483
Sooo good.

06:03.483 --> 06:04.614
Huh?!

06:04.614 --> 06:06.947
I have to say,
I'm pretty impressed.

see if you can handle...

and order already?

06:14.834 --> 06:16.296
I've already got my food!

06:16.296 --> 06:17.547
-Hello.
-Oh, my gosh!

-I'm an employee.
-Hello.

06:19.589 --> 06:22.502
I'm here to tell you
some fun facts about your meal.

06:22.502 --> 06:24.504
Oh, my gosh, wonderful!

06:24.504 --> 06:25.715
Isn't that wonderful,
Terry?

06:26.967 --> 06:28.678
Great!
Let's get started!

06:28.678 --> 06:31.271
Did you know octos
are beautiful and cute?

06:31.271 --> 06:33.563
[Alexander] Oh, my gosh,
I had no idea.

06:33.563 --> 06:34.895
-Uhhhh...
-What is it?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.107
Check out these diagrams!
Aren't they great?

06:37.107 --> 06:38.188
Aah! Oof!

06:38.188 --> 06:40.190
Tilly! Let's go!

06:40.190 --> 06:41.731
That concludes
the presentation.

06:41.731 --> 06:43.523
Thank you, bye!

06:43.523 --> 06:45.525
Well,
she was really sweet.

06:45.525 --> 06:48.578
What the--?!
Terry, why'd you eat
all my octopus?!

06:48.578 --> 06:50.580
[groaning]

06:50.580 --> 06:52.492
You can do this, Bill.

06:52.492 --> 06:55.375
You gotta show 'em you're just
like everyone else in Big City.

06:55.375 --> 06:56.536
Your dessert, sir.

06:56.536 --> 06:58.038
-Voilà!
-Huh?

06:58.038 --> 07:01.171
The Seven Seas Seven-Layer
Poseidon Slayer.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.133
Good luck.

[gulps]

07:05.305 --> 07:07.217

07:07.217 --> 07:09.139
All right, Tilly,

07:09.139 --> 07:11.601
Whoa there!
These don't belong here!

07:11.601 --> 07:12.602
They belong in the tank!

07:12.602 --> 07:13.473
Tank!?

07:17.147 --> 07:18.608
Oh, good golly,
Tilly.

07:18.608 --> 07:20.440
We've gotta save 'em all!

07:28.618 --> 07:29.990
Ooh!
Are you a performer?

07:29.990 --> 07:31.411
Is this a show?

07:31.411 --> 07:33.333
You bet yer tuchus it is.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.534
Yee-haw!

[groans] Huh?

07:45.965 --> 07:49.719
[dramatic music stingers]

07:49.719 --> 07:51.801
Oh, so you
wanna fight, huh?

07:51.801 --> 07:53.593
-Fight? No!
-What are you...

07:53.593 --> 07:55.435
I'll swab the deck
with ya!

07:55.435 --> 07:56.596
Aah!

07:57.647 --> 08:00.560
[gasps] What the--

08:00.560 --> 08:01.601
Where am I?

08:01.601 --> 08:03.483
Huh?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.945
Beautiful!

08:05.945 --> 08:09.699
This place is so... peaceful.

08:11.821 --> 08:13.033
[deep echoing voice]
Bill...

08:13.033 --> 08:14.704
Who said that?

08:16.206 --> 08:17.957
I did.

08:17.957 --> 08:19.459
Who are you?

08:19.459 --> 08:21.621
I... am a fish.

08:21.621 --> 08:22.832
Oh.

08:22.832 --> 08:24.964
But who are you,
Bill?

08:24.964 --> 08:27.217
Well, I'm a fish, too.

08:27.217 --> 08:28.968
Hmm. Are you sure?

08:28.968 --> 08:30.970
I don't really know anymore.

08:30.970 --> 08:35.265
Hey, there are
a lot of different
creatures in the sea.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.188
Not all of us are fish,
and that's okay.

08:38.188 --> 08:42.852
It's our differences that make
the ocean a wonderful place.

08:42.852 --> 08:45.275
You don't have to change
who you are to fit in.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.316
I don't?

08:46.316 --> 08:48.028

Now, Gloria, we can--

17:58.958 --> 17:59.959
Aah!

18:02.121 --> 18:04.123
That's fair, I broke
something of yours

18:04.123 --> 18:05.625
and you broke
something of mine.

18:05.625 --> 18:09.298
So we're even now, right?
Right?

18:09.298 --> 18:12.511
Guys! This is bad!
How did this get so bad?

18:12.511 --> 18:17.386
I think it had something to do
with you shattering
that lady's dreams.

18:17.386 --> 18:18.978
[gasps] The critterballs!

18:21.480 --> 18:22.812
She's killing them!

18:22.812 --> 18:24.313
We gotta put an end to this.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.855
Assemble the team!

18:28.938 --> 18:30.279

18:31.821 --> 18:35.074
Gloria! Show yourself!

18:35.074 --> 18:39.739
Cricket! Get those filthy,
disgusting monsters
out of the cafe!

18:39.739 --> 18:42.912
-First of all, how dare you.
-[moos]

18:42.912 --> 18:46.295
Second of all, we'll leave
just as soon as you give us
back our critterballs.

18:46.295 --> 18:49.008
Fine. You want 'em? You got 'em!

18:49.008 --> 18:50.009
Uh-oh.

18:50.009 --> 18:51.460

18:51.460 --> 18:53.803

Huh?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.745
Ha! You're out!

19:25.745 --> 19:28.457
Shoot. Guess I am.

19:28.457 --> 19:31.090
Anyone else feelin' brave?!

19:31.090 --> 19:33.883
[maniacal laughter]

19:33.883 --> 19:35.344
You had a good run, Remy.

19:35.344 --> 19:37.346

19:42.391 --> 19:43.472
No, no, no, no, no!

19:43.472 --> 19:47.356
Aah!

19:47.356 --> 19:49.648
Two down, one to go...

19:52.401 --> 19:54.233
Uh, Ms. Boss!
I mean, Ms. Cho!

19:54.233 --> 19:56.445
I-I didn't think
you'd be in today!

19:59.909 --> 20:01.781
I can explain! I can fix this!

20:01.781 --> 20:03.412
[growls]

20:03.412 --> 20:06.125
No, please! You can't fire me,
I need this job!

20:06.125 --> 20:08.497
[Gloria] Without it,
I'll never make it to Paris!

20:08.497 --> 20:10.329
<i> Paris! Paris!</i>

20:10.329 --> 20:14.333
Oh, my gosh.
Paris and critterball
are the same thing!

20:14.333 --> 20:16.465
Please, just give me
another chance!

20:16.465 --> 20:18.097
Um, Ms. Boss Lady?
Ma'am?

20:18.097 --> 20:19.929
Listen, this is all my fault.

20:19.929 --> 20:22.892
Gloria had nothing to do
with it. Sorry, Gloria.

20:22.892 --> 20:25.304
[Cricket] I got carried away
thinking something I cared about

20:25.304 --> 20:27.686
was more important
than what you cared about.

20:27.686 --> 20:30.479
So, Ms. Boss Lady,
don't fire Gloria.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.902
Instead, fire me!

20:32.902 --> 20:36.445
Cricket, that's nice...
but it doesn't make any sense.

20:36.445 --> 20:41.070
No, listen! You could hire me
and once I work off the damages,
then ya fire me!

20:41.070 --> 20:42.531

21:02.972 --> 21:05.144
[sighs] Yep.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.190
