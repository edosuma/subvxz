01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:52.989
No. This is not
on you guys, all right?

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:55.575
- Who do you think got the first message?
- Who did he send it to then?

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.869
Me. He sent me
the message, all right?

01:05:57.995 --> 01:05:59.496
I-- He said it was a game.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.082
And I sent it to you guys.
You know how that feels?

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:04.209
You wanna know what that--
Fuck it. All right.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:06.503
- l'll show you what that fucking feels like.
- What are you doing?

01:06:06.587 --> 01:06:08.797
- Neil, what are you doing?
- l'm gonna show you.

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:11.132
I'm gonna fucking show you what it's like
to be in my fucking shoes.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.550
What the fuck are you doing?

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.386
What are you doing?
Give me your phone.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.221
- [beeping]
- l sent you the message.

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.848
- You got it.
- [ringing]

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.185
- [chimes]
- [muffled crying]

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.649
All right. It's fine.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.735
You fucking shit.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.781
[all yelling]

01:06:34.865 --> 01:06:37.033
- Stop!
- Stop!

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:39.285
- You threaten my life?
- This isn't on you!

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:42.080
This is on me, all right?
This is on me!

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:45.083
Everybody's fucking dead,
and you pull a fucking gun out on us?

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.168
[phone chimes]

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.842
- Oh, fuck.
- [Michael] What?

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:56.052
- He fucking sent me another chain letter.
- What?

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:59.597
Fucking break the chain,
and you will die, man.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.893
Man, he's watching us.
He is watching us.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:06.354
Fuck you, Neil.
What are you saying? Where is he?

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:09.315
- He's here. He's watching us.
- We gotta do something now.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.235
Okay, so the way this works
is you die if you delete it, right?

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:15.405
The chain letter said
we had 24 hours.

01:07:15.489 --> 01:07:17.699
l don't wanna die.

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:20.910
l'm just gonna send the fucking message
to people that l hate, right?

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:22.912
l mean, if they die,
big fucking deal.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.664
- Too bad for them.
- You're fucking tripping right now.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:27.000
- Just chill out for a second.
- Hey, I sent the message to you,

01:07:27.084 --> 01:07:28.918
didn't I?

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:33.089
Fuck you guys, man.
l'm fucking outta here.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:36.217
So listen to me. I know how
we can pass these on, okay?

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.762
And then once it's over,
we just have to get rid of our phones

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:40.221
and our e-mail addresses, okay?

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.599
Whatever.
[scoffs]

01:07:42.683 --> 01:07:45.727
What the fuck
does it matter now, huh?

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.693
[sniffles]

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.410
[computer chimes]
You've received chain mail.

01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:09.417
Why the fuck do you keep
sending these to me, man?

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:12.212
I'm doing everything you want me to do.
I keep sending them on.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.006
Fucker!

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.471
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.

01:08:22.555 --> 01:08:25.015
What the fuck
you want me to do?

01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:27.810
l've sent off these goddamn chain letters
to everyone l fucking know.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.395
[stammering]

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:31.231
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.

01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:34.149
Fucking relax, man.
I just gotta take...

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.986
l gotta take a deep
fucking breath.

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:38.613
[exhales forcefully]

01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:40.281
l just gotta think
what I'm gonna do.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.368
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:46.996
Fucking Rachael.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:50.332
[mutters]

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:51.960
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.

01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:54.629
[sighs]
All right.

01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:57.966
[stammering]
I gotta fucking--

01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:01.094
- You've received chain mail.
- l gotta fucking do something.

01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:02.804
- l gotta fucking do something.
- You've received chain mail.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:04.471
He wants to fucking
play games with me.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.390
That's what he fucking
wants to do, huh?

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.934
- [computer continues]
- You wanna fucking play games?

01:09:08.018 --> 01:09:09.935
You wanna fucking
play games with me!

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.479
- Kill my goddamn sister!
- You've received chain mail.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.774
- Fucking delete this.
- [beeps]

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:18.653
Delete your fucking message, man.
Why don't you come and get me?

01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:21.447
Why don't you fucking
come and get me?

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.200
[grunts]

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:25.827
[cries out]

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:28.203
[grunting]

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.622
[screaming]

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:32.625
[screaming continues]

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.466
[yelling]

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:43.219
[screaming]

01:09:59.403 --> 01:10:00.778
[phone ringing]

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.614
[gasping]

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.699
[ringing continues]

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:13.791
- Jessie, what's going on?
- Just forward me the chain letter.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:16.252
Forward it to me,
and then change your number.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:19.088
Change your e-mail address,
and never use those old accounts again.

01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:21.341
Crenshaw has it set up so that
all the e-mails are going

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:23.301
to some police computer
that checks them.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:24.969
I don't feel good about this.
If it doesn't work,

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.429
everything's gonna fall on you.

01:10:26.513 --> 01:10:28.056
Just trust me, okay?
Just send it.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.308
l'll be fine. l'll be okay.
Just send it.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.185
[sighs]

01:10:32.269 --> 01:10:35.438
[thunder rumbling]

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.277
[ringing]

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.321
Crenshaw.

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.406
[Mr. Bradford]
Remember that link you were looking for?

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.408
Oh, Mr. Bradford.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.494
I remembered.

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:53.748
Used to be a place
out on Ramsey Road.

01:10:53.832 --> 01:10:56.292
Wilson. Dead now.

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:59.963
One of his sons
went off to that war.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:02.632
Used to supply chains
to the meatpacking plant.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:06.302
Plant went out of business.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:07.762
So did they.

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:29.575
[thinking]
"They brand themselves with bar codes."

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.202
Oh, my God.

01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:33.454
[beeping]

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.873
- [line ringing]
- Come on. Pick up.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.793
Crenshaw. Oh, shoot.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:44.799
Crenshaw, l know these are our guys.

01:11:44.883 --> 01:11:47.719
They're an old cult
that grew in the 20th century.

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:50.555
They call themselves
Technology Terrorists.

01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:59.147
They were vocal until Y2K,

01:11:59.231 --> 01:12:01.107
and when nothing happened,
they dropped out of sight.

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:12.827
They brand themselves
with bar codes

01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:16.998
to demonstrate how technology
destroys individual identity.

01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:20.960
- Oh, shoot.
- [beeps]

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.136
[clinking]

01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:45.318
[clinking continues]

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.745
[Man yelling, distant]

01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:03.169
[yelling continues]

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:24.148
[yelling grows louder]

01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:37.328
[yelling continues]

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:43.459
- Who are you?
- l'm Kevin Daniels.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:44.502
l'm Kevin Daniels.

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:47.588
Ooh, you're all gonna die.
[echoing]

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:48.923
Delete.

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:50.466
Hey, man, l wanna go home.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:52.844
Okay, son.
l'll help you.

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:55.638
- Please! The line!
- Okay.

01:13:55.722 --> 01:13:58.349
All right.
Where'd he go?

01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:00.017
No. No.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.894
I don't know where he is.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:03.729
l'll get you down.
l'll help you.

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.773
[yelling]

01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.611
[screaming]

01:14:44.521 --> 01:14:46.397
- [whispers] Hello.
- [Man] Investigation.

01:14:46.523 --> 01:14:48.816
[panting]

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:53.070
This is Crenshaw.
I need to speak to Wiggins now.

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.739
Crenshaw,
where have you been?

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:56.574
We've been trying
to reach you all day.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.534
- Our security system's been hacked.
- What?

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:01.704
The guy claiming to be Wiggins yesterday
turned out to be an imposter.

01:15:01.788 --> 01:15:04.040
You're not gonna believe this,
but the actual Wiggins

01:15:04.124 --> 01:15:06.125
turned up deceased
less than an hour ago.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.463
We need you back at the station.
Where are you?

01:15:10.547 --> 01:15:14.175
lt doesn't matter about
the result or the application.

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:18.346
They don't like technology.
[echoing]

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:22.058
- [Crenshaw's voice] Antech.
- [Female's voice] They're a cult.

01:15:22.142 --> 01:15:23.976
- They're a cult.
- [Crenshaw] What's his name?

01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:25.811
- They're a cult.
- Wiggins?

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:27.897
- Fight fire with fire.
- They're a cult.

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:29.857
We all got these chain letters.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.193
[Wiggins' voice]
They don't like technology.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:33.861
[Female Detective]
Cult. They're a cult.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:37.865
Where there is a good side
there is also a bad side.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:41.410
- They're a cult. They're a cult.
- Both are out there

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.496
- ...lurking somewhere.
- They're a cult.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.873

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.995
[Crenshaw's voice]
Jessie, can you forward

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.913
this chain letter
from your phone?

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.795
l want you to send it
to this address.

01:16:32.879 --> 01:16:34.880
And then send it to me.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:42.471
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:43.806
[phone chimes]

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:49.145
We can handle it.

01:17:29.227 --> 01:17:31.145
Hey, Jessie, it's Michael.

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:33.230
Look, l need you to call me back
as soon as possible,

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.274
'cause l'm seriously worried
about you, all right?

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:37.568
I don't know if this whole
sending the chain letter things

01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:39.403
to you was a good idea.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.447
Just call me back as soon
as you get this, all right?

01:17:41.531 --> 01:17:44.116
If not, l'll be there
early in the morning.

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:46.160

01:20:58.061 --> 01:21:01.105
And we are live on the scene
at the Carlson Police Department

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:04.066
with a shocking new development
in the teen murder spree.

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:06.277
A police detective investigating

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.654
these heinous crimes
has now gone missing.

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:11.907
[Man] All right.
So what are you thinking?

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.159
Maybe she needs more
than a counselor.
