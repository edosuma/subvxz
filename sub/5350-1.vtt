00:39.639 --> 00:41.526
Help me.

00:54.119 --> 00:55.921
Oh, God.

01:00.459 --> 01:02.380
Help me!

01:03.362 --> 01:05.183
Please...

01:05.664 --> 01:07.586
Help me.

01:10.135 --> 01:11.990
Please.

01:12.805 --> 01:14.593
Help me.

02:02.455 --> 02:06.011
It's supposed to be playing sport,
fucking faggot!

02:19.371 --> 02:21.859
You broke the TV again.

02:22.408 --> 02:23.609
What're you talking about?

02:23.709 --> 02:28.033
You plugged all this wires and shit
into it. Now there's no picture.

02:28.848 --> 02:31.235
You fucking drunk.

02:32.351 --> 02:34.486
- What did you say to me?
- You heard me.

02:34.586 --> 02:38.174
What did you say to me?
Say it again! Say it again!

02:38.324 --> 02:42.230
You're a big tough guy, now? Say it.

02:44.730 --> 02:47.152
I'll fix it when I get back.

02:48.768 --> 02:51.289
Yeah, you'll fix it.

03:43.522 --> 03:46.726
Too scared to eat in the cafeteria
with everybody else?

03:46.826 --> 03:48.728
I'm not scared.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.380
Then why are you out here
doodling like a little girl?

03:51.600 --> 03:52.732
What did I ever do to you?

03:52.832 --> 03:57.322
You came to this school and acted
like a fag, you fucking freak.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.791
Get outta my way.

04:01.139 --> 04:05.296
Oh, man, you came all over yourself!

04:06.629 --> 04:09.731
Is it because you're so excited
to see me, fag tag?

04:14.637 --> 04:16.158
You gonna clean up that mess?

04:17.990 --> 04:19.797
Are you crying?

04:21.627 --> 04:25.202
What do they say?
No crying over spilled milk?

04:25.631 --> 04:28.000
Come on, fag tag, lick it up.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.002
You getting this?

04:30.302 --> 04:32.509
Leave me alone!

04:33.972 --> 04:35.680
I'll fucking kill you!

06:02.726 --> 06:04.768
Here you go.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.070
50 bucks for each criminal mastermind.

06:11.170 --> 06:15.574
Oh, come on. They're not bad kids,
they're just a little lost.

06:15.674 --> 06:20.283
- Now they're found.
- Well, they will be, once they meet him.

06:20.712 --> 06:25.122
- You don't get out too much, do you, Krauss?
- Mister Iverson needs me here.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.006
At the school.

06:27.106 --> 06:30.127
Bye now, have a blessed day!

06:36.561 --> 06:41.487
For those of you joining our program
this semester, welcome.

06:41.867 --> 06:47.010
I designed Mind's Eye Academy
as a place to reset.

06:48.039 --> 06:52.349
A place to learn
how to do things differently.

06:54.279 --> 06:57.049
We attune ourselves to the desert.

06:57.149 --> 07:00.758
To the Earth, and to the sky.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.390
Giving your cell phones to Christine

07:05.490 --> 07:08.165
frees you up to other communications.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.501
We work with our hands...

07:13.601 --> 07:14.958
as well as our minds.

07:15.058 --> 07:16.787
There's no service here, anyways.

07:17.287 --> 07:21.503
- It's got all my music.
- No exceptions.

07:22.607 --> 07:25.983
But if you think of it
as part of a larger process,

07:26.645 --> 07:28.651
then it just might.

07:34.686 --> 07:39.094
You've come here to destroy
the impulses that got you here.

08:05.717 --> 08:07.892
I've seen worse.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.890
The place is a fucking scam.

08:11.490 --> 08:15.360
Yeah, see that Mercedes in the lot?

08:15.460 --> 08:17.796
We could hotwire it, take it to Vegas.

08:17.896 --> 08:21.867
Yeah, why not? They can pin some
more bullshit crimes on us, right?

08:22.167 --> 08:26.043
Okay, hold on. My crime
was not bullshit, all right?

08:29.040 --> 08:31.617
- Porn hack.
- What?

08:31.717 --> 08:36.181
I... rerouted my school servers
to Bangtastic.com. I'm sure you know it.

08:36.280 --> 08:40.219
You know, everyone googling Selena Gomez,
or Bieber, or whoever the fuck, you know.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.827
Bang! Big cocks. Wide open pussies.

08:44.923 --> 08:47.492
How much of a hero are you?

08:47.592 --> 08:51.834
I was number one thug for about a day.
So what about you?

08:52.965 --> 08:55.973
Come on, man, we're all fuckups here.

08:57.636 --> 09:01.599
This kid was picking on me for years.

09:02.457 --> 09:04.765
I finally hit him back.

09:05.076 --> 09:06.945
They blamed it on me.

09:07.545 --> 09:10.049
Fucking bullies always
get away with their shit.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.885
I wanna live in a world where...

09:12.985 --> 09:15.393
where assholes get
what they deserve, you know?

09:16.888 --> 09:19.730
Well, you must have clocked
the shit outta that dude.

09:43.282 --> 09:46.421
Come on, man. It ain't so bad.

09:46.621 --> 09:51.189
We're surrounded by beautiful sunsets
and emotionally annihilated girls.

09:51.289 --> 09:54.593
Yeah, I could get into
sitting on the porch

09:54.693 --> 09:57.916
with a shotgun, dropping acid.

09:58.096 --> 10:01.538
Firing at invisible machine elves.

10:06.437 --> 10:09.212
Jesus, no means no, guy.

10:26.491 --> 10:28.532
Eating alone?

10:29.694 --> 10:31.535
No.

10:33.532 --> 10:36.819
- I heard about you.
- Is that a good thing?

10:36.919 --> 10:38.726
Pretty good.

10:43.342 --> 10:46.278
- What was that about?
- Oh, he's just asking about you.

10:46.378 --> 10:49.749
- What's with all the attention?
- Come on,

10:49.849 --> 10:51.922
you like it.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.126
Nice.

10:57.522 --> 11:01.565
- Seriously, what was that about?
- I don't know, forget about it.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.647
Samantha. Tell us why you're here.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.183
Because my parents are fucking retarded.

11:24.283 --> 11:28.019
- Let's not blame others.
- Because I was selling pills.

11:28.119 --> 11:32.187
I wanted to be captain of the soccer team,
my parents expected straight As.

11:32.287 --> 11:34.379
But with Adderall I could do everything.

11:34.659 --> 11:37.967
- So what's the problem?
- Kaitlin...

11:38.396 --> 11:40.999
<i>Your mind is everything,
what you think, you become.</i>

11:41.099 --> 11:44.038
<i>Do not dwell on the past,
do not dream of the future.</i>

11:44.138 --> 11:46.104
<i>Concentrate the mind
on the present moment.</i>

11:46.204 --> 11:47.273
Hey.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.310
- She makes me desperate for a cigarette.
- Have you seen our teacher?

11:51.410 --> 11:53.984
And try to run the down and up.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.615
And back into downward dog.

11:56.715 --> 11:59.801
The desire to be perfect?
The trick of the ego.

12:00.251 --> 12:03.489
Screw that.
Everybody wants to be perfect.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.590
He's not saying everyone
doesn't wanna be perfect,

12:05.690 --> 12:08.327
he's just saying that wanting
doesn't get you very far.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.835
Very helpful, Willie, thank you.

12:12.901 --> 12:14.966
May seem crazy to you guys.

12:15.066 --> 12:18.270
Trust me, it did to me, too
when I used to go here.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.888
Keep your spine aligned.

12:19.988 --> 12:21.774
- Lincoln?
- What?

12:21.874 --> 12:23.558
Would you like to tell us
why you're here?

12:23.708 --> 12:25.516
No.

12:26.345 --> 12:28.098
I don't deserve to be here.

12:52.670 --> 12:54.844
Let's go, man.

12:55.374 --> 12:57.248
I'm good.

13:32.177 --> 13:34.842
I thought you were pretty badass.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.390
I mean, stabbing somebody in the face
with a fork? That's pretty gangster.

13:40.836 --> 13:42.638
He got what he deserved.

13:43.388 --> 13:46.596
Yeah, well, we don't need
to pull vigilante shit here, right?

13:47.058 --> 13:49.332
I'm cool with that.

13:50.695 --> 13:52.603
You're cool with that?

13:57.102 --> 13:59.309
Fucking cool with that?

14:00.438 --> 14:02.695
Isn't that fucking groovy?

14:37.442 --> 14:40.103
It's because of you, isn't it?
You're going around telling people

14:40.203 --> 14:42.881
that I'm some freak that stabbed
someone with a fork.

14:42.981 --> 14:44.482
No, I'm not.

14:44.582 --> 14:47.758
At least have the balls
to admit it, Isaac.

14:49.821 --> 14:53.625
- All right, man, but it's badass.
- No, it's not.

14:53.725 --> 14:58.830
Because now people are gonna test me
to see if I lose my shit.

14:58.930 --> 15:02.333
No. They'll think you're a stone cold killer
and leave you the fuck alone.

15:02.433 --> 15:04.636
Not how it works, Isaac.

15:04.736 --> 15:09.095
Jesus, all right, I'm just trying to help.
Why don't you fucking stick up for yourself?

16:23.215 --> 16:27.664
What we've got here
is a failure to communicate.

16:32.891 --> 16:36.794
Look, I'm just fucking with you.
I mean, seriously, how clichÃ© is this?

16:36.894 --> 16:41.043
The bully picking on the spazzy kid,
trying to get him to freak out?

16:42.400 --> 16:44.641
Glad you came around.

16:55.913 --> 16:58.369
I just wanna skip to the part
where you freak out.

17:01.486 --> 17:04.623
Oops. Guess I'm the spazz.

17:05.123 --> 17:06.808
Nasty.

17:06.907 --> 17:08.982
You actually talk?

17:11.429 --> 17:13.503
I thought you'd just have him
do it for you.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.806
Pick it up.

17:19.871 --> 17:21.711
No.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.144
Pick it the fuck up.

17:47.832 --> 17:49.373
Good job, shitheads.

17:55.273 --> 17:57.314
Oh, fuck.

18:00.612 --> 18:01.952
Fuck.

18:36.347 --> 18:38.288
Nice lighter.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.757
Thanks.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.266
It was my mom's.

18:51.029 --> 18:53.569
I think it's cool, you know.

18:54.399 --> 18:57.207
What you did to that kid
to get sent here.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.643
I feel bad.

19:02.807 --> 19:05.249
People get what they deserve.

19:05.661 --> 19:07.800
Or they should.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.253
I hate bullies.

19:17.855 --> 19:21.998
- What'd you do to get here?
- Usual bad girl stuff.

19:23.094 --> 19:25.735
The wayward cheerleader.

19:26.330 --> 19:29.530
- You're a cheerleader?
- Past life.

19:31.035 --> 19:33.995
I think it's starting to happen again...

19:34.595 --> 19:36.303
with Willie.

19:37.475 --> 19:39.527
I don't wanna fight him.

19:39.627 --> 19:41.923
But he keeps testing me.

19:43.699 --> 19:45.505
I can help.

19:50.488 --> 19:51.957
What are you gonna do?

19:58.630 --> 20:00.870
I'll kick his ass.

20:02.050 --> 20:04.186
You'll get us both killed.

20:05.703 --> 20:07.844
Here's hoping.

20:20.785 --> 20:22.821
- Wait, do it again.
- Do it again. Do it again.

20:22.921 --> 20:25.523
Just say that. Don't fuck up. Yeah.

20:25.623 --> 20:27.159
- "Tippin' on my dick"?
- That shit...

20:27.259 --> 20:32.388
<i>I'm in the party with my jeans to a sag
If a girl wanna dance then she gotta be bad</i>

20:32.488 --> 20:34.366
<i>Tippin' on my dick
Tip, tippin' on my dick</i>

20:34.466 --> 20:38.169
I like any song that's about anybody
licking my clit. This is a good song.

20:38.269 --> 20:40.819
<i>I'm tasty, yeah, I'm a cold ass bitch</i>

20:40.919 --> 20:43.023
<i>I gotta be specifically
in this piece of shit</i>

20:43.123 --> 20:45.476
<i>So fuck you literally
and come and get my shit</i>

20:45.576 --> 20:47.445
- Oh, shit.
- What happens next?

20:47.545 --> 20:49.085
Oh, shit.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.727
What's this?

21:35.527 --> 21:36.934
Fuck you, Iverson.

21:53.244 --> 21:56.181
- You scared the shit out of me.
- I'm sorry.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.388
Walls are super thin.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.219
What are they gonna do?

22:01.319 --> 22:04.726
Put us in a reform school
in the middle of the desert?

22:05.306 --> 22:08.161
Or else they'll meditate us to death.

22:09.093 --> 22:11.434
I brought you something.

22:12.313 --> 22:14.116
I made a playlist for you.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.501
Where'd you hide this?

22:16.601 --> 22:20.790
I found where they stashed them,
and I took it back.

22:21.205 --> 22:24.943
- Fuck them, it's mine.
- Awesome.

22:25.143 --> 22:26.883
Thanks.

22:28.746 --> 22:31.750
I know you're a cheerleader,
or whatever.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.186
Maybe you won't like this music, but...

23:02.046 --> 23:04.287
That's awesome.

23:07.585 --> 23:10.473
It saved me so many times.

23:10.955 --> 23:14.463
Have you ever had the feeling,
when your whole body's saying...

23:15.292 --> 23:18.067
you wanna punch your head
through the wall?

23:18.429 --> 23:20.042
This...

23:20.142 --> 23:23.294
makes me feel
like I'm driving a tank and...

23:23.394 --> 23:27.205
rolling over piles of skulls
and blasting mortar shells

23:27.305 --> 23:30.584
through everybody that pissed me off.

23:31.275 --> 23:33.745
I mean, you go through
this whole experience

23:33.845 --> 23:38.514
of anger and fighting and hatred.

23:38.749 --> 23:40.990
And when the song's over,

23:41.819 --> 23:44.661
I don't feel like putting my head
through a wall.

23:45.689 --> 23:48.031
For just that one minute.

23:50.027 --> 23:51.969
I know exactly that feeling.

23:54.565 --> 23:56.273
Do...

24:08.579 --> 24:10.782
You need to fight him.

24:10.882 --> 24:12.083
What?

24:12.183 --> 24:13.919
Willie.

24:14.519 --> 24:17.355
If you don't take him down early,
he will eat you alive.

24:17.455 --> 24:20.258
Kaitlin, this is the exact reason
why I'm here.

24:20.358 --> 24:23.661
Do it in front of his friends.
He won't squeal.

24:23.761 --> 24:26.310
Hit him once and he'll crumble.

24:27.615 --> 24:30.685
Show him that skull-crushing tank,
and he'll find somebody else to fuck with.

24:31.135 --> 24:33.838
I don't think that's a good idea.

24:33.938 --> 24:36.779
Don't think, Lincoln.

24:40.211 --> 24:43.650
I should... I should get back
to my room.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.253
- Where you going, man?
- I'm afraid I forgot...

25:55.353 --> 25:57.556
You look like take a shower.
Don't let me stop you.

25:57.656 --> 25:58.887
It's okay.

25:58.987 --> 26:01.225
Clean yourself off
for that hot snatch of yours.

26:01.325 --> 26:04.711
- She does like it dirty, trust me, I know.
- She figure out you're a faggot?

26:05.829 --> 26:08.037
You guys are pathetic.

26:11.369 --> 26:15.328
- Get the fuck off me!
- Always the hard way with you.

26:16.974 --> 26:20.344
- I'll fucking kill you!
- What, a little spanking?

26:20.444 --> 26:22.886
- This is messed up, man, let's forget it.
- Shut up.

26:25.649 --> 26:28.205
She's gonna love this.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.811
You hit me.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.206
No, let's quit.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.757
I wish they were all dead.

27:38.155 --> 27:41.798
I wish they were all dead.
I wish they were all dead.

27:42.793 --> 27:45.101
I wish they were all dead!

27:47.098 --> 27:48.738
Lincoln...

27:52.870 --> 27:54.638
I'll kill them all.

27:57.208 --> 28:00.130
We'll kill them all together.

28:35.513 --> 28:38.249
- I gotta go.
- Oh, yeah?

28:38.349 --> 28:41.290
When did you learn
to act like such a man?

28:45.656 --> 28:47.931
It obviously wasn't
from those high school girls.

28:50.928 --> 28:53.064
I bet they didn't even know
what to do with you.

28:53.164 --> 28:55.609
I guess it just comes naturally.

28:59.370 --> 29:02.215
I'm gonna kill that fucking kid.

29:06.477 --> 29:08.579
So fucking weak, I can see it.

29:08.679 --> 29:11.571
He doesn't look so weak to me.
Popped you pretty good.

29:11.871 --> 29:14.085
He got it worse, trust me.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.692
Be careful, Willie.

30:17.315 --> 30:20.657
Please... please help me.

30:22.787 --> 30:24.894
Who the fuck is that?

30:55.353 --> 30:58.695
Help me, Willie, please.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.699
You're gonna die.

32:09.226 --> 32:11.600
Wake up, Kaitlin!

32:14.332 --> 32:17.512
- Come on, you're on cleanup duty.
- I'm coming.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.831
Oh, fuck.

33:41.484 --> 33:43.892
I don't believe this.

33:44.521 --> 33:47.997
I was just playing ball with him
a few hours before.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.563
The divide between the self
we present to the world

33:52.963 --> 33:56.572
- and our true inner self...
- No, fuck that.

33:56.934 --> 34:00.838
No, Willie wasn't hiding this.
I knew him better than any of you.

34:00.938 --> 34:03.540
He never would've...

34:03.640 --> 34:06.478
Never would've done this shit.

34:06.844 --> 34:08.818
It's truly very sad.

34:09.179 --> 34:12.545
But let's not allow sadness and grief

34:12.645 --> 34:15.686
turn to anger and negativity.

34:15.786 --> 34:19.489
Just remember that Willie was a young man
who'd shown in his time here

34:19.589 --> 34:21.452
remarkable spiritual growth.

34:58.462 --> 35:00.731
You all right there, partner?

35:00.831 --> 35:02.782
Yeah, it's just a shock, you know?

35:04.301 --> 35:06.403
He was a good kid?

35:06.503 --> 35:08.410
Not really.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.824
You know, it's a... hour drive...

35:14.044 --> 35:16.886
every time I gotta come
pick up a dead kid.

35:17.714 --> 35:19.587
Each way.

35:20.450 --> 35:22.940
I mean, these fuckups
gotta quit killing themselves.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.623
Or else things will get difficult
for y'all out here.

35:25.723 --> 35:27.229
I understand.

35:28.091 --> 35:30.376
Well, I hope that you do.

35:31.228 --> 35:33.698
'Cause I can only keep the wolves
from the door for so long.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.714
There was blood everywhere.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.220
I mean...

35:47.320 --> 35:51.559
I've seen people cut themselves,
or whatever, but this...

35:52.082 --> 35:54.426
Willie must've been out of his mind.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.914
Maybe he was Borderline Personality.

35:58.889 --> 36:02.662
Maybe he hated himself as much
as he hated everybody else.

36:04.027 --> 36:06.864
Maybe all the filth and nastiness
just came pouring out of him at once

36:06.964 --> 36:09.739
and he slit his own fucking throat,
I don't know.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.311
Look.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.004
Shit.

36:25.649 --> 36:28.023
Oh, fuck.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.556
Hey.

36:32.656 --> 36:35.881
- Are you okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

36:36.459 --> 36:38.834
This isn't a tragedy.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.570
I don't know, it's weird.

36:42.466 --> 36:44.773
I feel responsible.

36:45.903 --> 36:48.214
Like I made this happen.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.758
Willie'd love to hurt you.

36:53.043 --> 36:55.508
You should be high-fiving God,
right now.

36:57.148 --> 36:59.121
You're free.

37:00.618 --> 37:03.188
That's the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

37:03.921 --> 37:06.523
Why would he do that to himself?

37:06.623 --> 37:08.553
Maybe...

37:08.853 --> 37:11.977
someone carved that
into his skin, and then...

37:12.077 --> 37:14.000
murdered him.

37:15.098 --> 37:16.967
I don't know.

37:17.067 --> 37:19.274
Who would do that?

37:47.447 --> 37:50.461
They'll never fuck with us again.

37:56.757 --> 37:58.304
Hey.

37:59.576 --> 38:01.369
Iverson wants to see you.

38:02.579 --> 38:06.655
- Why?
- What's it matter why? Come on.

38:09.619 --> 38:12.957
Look at me. Hey, look at me. You high?

38:13.557 --> 38:15.559
Did you get in a fight?

38:15.659 --> 38:18.600
- What?
- Your cheek.

38:20.097 --> 38:22.137
Basketball.

38:23.667 --> 38:25.708
You and Willie didn't get along.

38:26.903 --> 38:28.939
We weren't friends.

38:29.039 --> 38:33.468
Come on, Lincoln.
You're not in trouble. Talk to me.

38:36.213 --> 38:39.087
No, we didn't... we didn't get along.

38:39.382 --> 38:41.517
It's a mystery to me.

38:41.617 --> 38:44.631
Why some kids decide
to pick on other kids.

38:44.855 --> 38:48.759
I'm sure Willie could answer that
for you better than I can.

38:48.859 --> 38:52.118
How does that make you feel?
That Willie's dead.

38:54.664 --> 38:56.405
I...

38:57.234 --> 39:00.642
- I feel bad for his family.
- But relieved.

39:01.538 --> 39:02.973
I didn't say that.

39:03.073 --> 39:05.642
You can be honest.
There's a part of you.

39:05.742 --> 39:08.211
Maybe just a really small part.

39:08.311 --> 39:11.820
- A part that's happy that Willie's dead.
- Shut the fuck up!

39:26.046 --> 39:28.120
What is it?

39:32.269 --> 39:34.609
I feel like...

39:35.559 --> 39:37.970
something's out there.

39:38.475 --> 39:40.649
It's called guilt.

39:41.445 --> 39:44.019
Why would I feel guilty?

39:45.214 --> 39:47.351
'Cause you killed Willie.

39:47.451 --> 39:51.887
- With your mind.
- I didn't kill him.

39:51.987 --> 39:53.906
Jeez...

39:54.006 --> 39:56.385
you are stressed.

40:16.713 --> 40:19.229
- You know the other night?
- Yeah?

40:19.783 --> 40:22.024
I felt these.

40:23.587 --> 40:26.611
Those are from my bad girl phase.

40:26.957 --> 40:29.741
Right above my cheerleader skirt.

40:30.493 --> 40:32.528
You're a cutter?

40:33.232 --> 40:34.736
I was.

40:35.298 --> 40:38.149
I was really hurting at the time, and...

40:38.535 --> 40:43.317
cutting made the pain feel
like it's... under my control.

40:50.447 --> 40:53.155
It's my version of death metal.

42:56.523 --> 42:58.463
What do you want from me?

42:59.309 --> 43:01.683
What do you want from me?

43:04.113 --> 43:06.426
What do you want from me?

43:06.526 --> 43:08.590
Answer me!

43:20.396 --> 43:21.803
I could wipe you out.

43:23.199 --> 43:25.440
With my mind.

43:25.835 --> 43:27.632
So don't fuck with me.

43:33.910 --> 43:35.684
Fuck!

44:16.353 --> 44:18.597
Do you know whose blood this is?

44:25.295 --> 44:27.535
Do you miss him?

45:03.132 --> 45:07.775
I'll kill you! You hear me,
I'll fucking kill you!

45:08.738 --> 45:11.179
Get the fuck out!

46:06.395 --> 46:08.970
You just do what they tell you, right?

46:09.832 --> 46:13.409
There's always one of you!
You fucking coward!

46:17.340 --> 46:20.677
Moira Karp was a student here.
She killed herself at the school.

46:20.777 --> 46:24.714
I also found this. The link is dead,
but the original's still on this hard drive.

46:24.814 --> 46:27.322
They made it right here in this room.

46:27.518 --> 46:30.721
- This is the page they took down.
- Who took it down?

46:30.821 --> 46:33.256
Probably Iverson
covered up this sick mess.

46:33.556 --> 46:36.626
"Moira Karp's food diary: Come.

46:37.026 --> 46:40.163
More come. Even more come."

46:40.263 --> 46:41.798
They hated this girl.

46:41.898 --> 46:44.840
This was years ago.
What does this have to do with Willie?

46:45.902 --> 46:47.505
I've seen her.

46:48.155 --> 46:49.928
Here.

46:50.307 --> 46:52.480
You all right, man?

46:56.379 --> 46:58.586
I have to warn them.

47:22.406 --> 47:23.912
Moira?

47:27.810 --> 47:29.737
Wanna try?

47:29.837 --> 47:31.577
Please...

47:31.677 --> 47:33.344
you have to stop this.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.952
But...

47:36.152 --> 47:38.526
This is what you wanted.

47:40.156 --> 47:41.800
Stop!

47:58.941 --> 48:02.984
I'm yours, Lincoln. And you're mine.

48:13.489 --> 48:15.863
Do you got a minute?

48:17.127 --> 48:18.752
Yeah.

48:20.062 --> 48:23.866
You were a student here, right?
Before you started teaching?

48:23.966 --> 48:27.491
- A few years ago, yeah.
- Maybe you can help me with something.

48:27.591 --> 48:30.907
I'm trying to find out about a girl
who used to go here.

48:31.007 --> 48:32.914
Moira Karp.

48:33.642 --> 48:35.417
Where did you hear of her?

48:36.580 --> 48:38.620
Just around.

48:39.149 --> 48:41.100
Did you know her?

48:41.200 --> 48:43.686
- I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

48:44.054 --> 48:46.189
Because she was evil.

48:46.289 --> 48:49.679
She was, Kaitlin.
You would've thought so, too.

48:49.779 --> 48:53.691
She lied all the time, she got
all of us girls in trouble. She just...

48:53.791 --> 48:57.605
she was crazy. Dangerous crazy.

48:58.450 --> 49:00.758
What happened to her?

49:03.673 --> 49:05.947
She killed herself.

49:06.926 --> 49:09.851
- Because of what the other girls did to her?
- Because she was sick.

49:11.547 --> 49:12.649
Christine!

49:12.749 --> 49:15.785
Everyone, find your inner peace.
Find your calm.

49:15.885 --> 49:18.729
Tend to your chores,
tend to your chores.

49:24.127 --> 49:26.067
What did you see?

49:29.298 --> 49:31.272
I don't know.

49:36.372 --> 49:38.513
We need to talk.

49:41.010 --> 49:43.079
Lincoln, what happened?

49:43.179 --> 49:46.220
- I saw her.
- Wait, you saw Moira?

49:46.849 --> 49:50.258
She killed Derek.
She cut him into fucking ribbons.

49:51.455 --> 49:53.389
You killed them.

49:53.489 --> 49:56.158
- Is that what you...
- No! Listen to me!

49:56.258 --> 49:59.200
- You can tell me the truth.
- I am!

50:00.196 --> 50:02.666
If you did this,
they got what they deserve.

50:02.766 --> 50:05.039
You stood up for yourself.

50:06.569 --> 50:08.040
How could you say that?

50:08.140 --> 50:11.728
It's payback, Lincoln.
Fucking bullies, they're all the same.

50:12.208 --> 50:16.395
What would you know? You're the hot,
popular girl that everyone likes.

50:16.495 --> 50:18.736
I know, okay?

50:19.015 --> 50:21.389
I know all about it.

50:24.720 --> 50:27.340
Nobody here knows this, but...

50:27.440 --> 50:29.614
There was a girl in my high school.

50:29.959 --> 50:32.733
She was my best friend growing up.

50:33.029 --> 50:37.071
And then she stole my boyfriend,
and I turned everybody against her.

50:38.501 --> 50:41.971
I spread a rumor that she had herpes,
I told her boyfriend, my ex,

50:42.071 --> 50:44.979
and I convinced him that she had lied.

50:45.975 --> 50:49.517
He was so pissed he gave me
a bunch of naked photos of her.

50:50.180 --> 50:53.103
And I texted them around the school.

50:53.850 --> 50:57.053
I just wanted to shame her, you know?
Put her in her place.

50:57.153 --> 50:59.456
I made her life hell.

50:59.556 --> 51:02.303
And it became like an addiction.

51:02.691 --> 51:05.795
I got a rush every time she cried.

51:05.895 --> 51:08.161
That's horrible.

51:10.166 --> 51:12.240
It gets worse.

51:13.269 --> 51:15.476
She killed herself.

51:19.075 --> 51:21.983
And I never expected it to go that far.

51:23.646 --> 51:27.755
You can imagine how terrible
I have felt every day since then.

51:32.355 --> 51:34.129
And...

51:35.191 --> 51:38.232
And that's why
I started things with you.

51:40.830 --> 51:43.199
I wanted to know
what it felt like to be a victim.

51:43.299 --> 51:46.574
I wanted to help somebody for once,
instead of hurting them.

51:48.771 --> 51:50.912
How could you?

51:53.109 --> 51:54.911
Was I...

51:55.311 --> 51:57.542
Was I just some freak...

51:57.942 --> 52:00.154
that you examined?

52:04.403 --> 52:07.490
- Why don't you...
- No, no, no, please, please...

52:07.590 --> 52:09.429
please that's how it started...

52:10.293 --> 52:12.729
Do you know how that makes me feel?

52:13.829 --> 52:15.631
I'm sorry.

52:15.731 --> 52:18.100
I have to stop Moira
before she kills someone else.

52:18.200 --> 52:21.476
You don't have to lie to me,
I'm on your side.

52:22.171 --> 52:24.412
Stay away.

54:02.839 --> 54:04.546
Moira?

54:10.346 --> 54:12.187
Moira!

54:16.386 --> 54:19.005
Lincoln! You came!

54:19.105 --> 54:22.741
- Moira, you have to stop.
- But they deserve it.

54:22.991 --> 54:27.246
- They don't deserve to die.
- You wanted them dead, you said it.

54:28.197 --> 54:30.237
I didn't know you existed.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.617
You wanted it, Lincoln, I can feel it.
I can feel your anger, it brought me back!

54:35.837 --> 54:39.108
- I was just scared.
- We've both suffered alone.

54:39.208 --> 54:42.178
But now I can get all of them,
we can do it together, kill everybody.

54:42.278 --> 54:45.097
- Whoever fucked with us!
- Moira!

54:45.781 --> 54:48.451
You have to stop, please.

54:48.551 --> 54:51.989
- Don't say that!
- Just go away!

54:52.689 --> 54:55.324
- I don't need you anymore.
- Don't say that, please!

54:55.424 --> 54:59.800
- Don't be like the rest of them, please!
- I don't need you anymore!

55:07.821 --> 55:09.727
Moira!

55:43.289 --> 55:45.063
Moira?

55:48.544 --> 55:51.080
I can't help you no more, Jack.

55:51.180 --> 55:52.948
It's a copycat thing, okay?

55:53.048 --> 55:56.786
One kid decides to do it,
another kid decides to do it, too.

55:56.886 --> 55:58.787
I'll handle it.

55:58.887 --> 56:01.690
Enough of that crap.

56:01.790 --> 56:04.126
I've gotta call it in.

56:04.226 --> 56:06.895
Gotta send the kids home.

56:06.995 --> 56:09.403
Gotta shut it down, man.

56:09.798 --> 56:11.500
Can't do that.

56:11.600 --> 56:14.908
Some of these kids
come from real dangerous homes.

56:15.670 --> 56:18.446
There's nothing more dangerous
than this place.

56:20.142 --> 56:23.283
Look, you got until tomorrow morning...

56:23.746 --> 56:26.248
then I'm coming back, Jack.

56:26.348 --> 56:28.502
And I'm not coming alone.

56:28.602 --> 56:31.309
Kaitlin. Kaitlin.

56:31.754 --> 56:34.094
You're gonna get in trouble.

56:34.556 --> 56:36.797
Have you seen Kaitlin?

56:40.629 --> 56:42.871
What did it look like?

56:45.835 --> 56:48.191
I heard both his wrists were slashed.

56:52.208 --> 56:53.848
Leave me alone.

56:54.710 --> 56:56.351
I was just asking.

56:59.014 --> 57:00.488
Kaitlin.

57:41.924 --> 57:44.198
Did that hurt?

57:52.268 --> 57:53.775
Did that hurt?

57:54.737 --> 57:56.377
Yeah.

58:37.847 --> 58:40.287
What're we gonna tell the kids?

58:43.319 --> 58:45.421
That it's not their fault.

58:45.521 --> 58:48.023
<i>Sheriff, you got an ETA?
You've been gone all day.</i>

58:48.123 --> 58:52.433
We can't keep pretending that everything's
okay, we have to shut this place down.

58:53.662 --> 58:55.204
That's not gonna happen.

58:56.498 --> 59:01.676
And I'm coming back from... Third Eye
Academy, what do they call it?

59:01.937 --> 59:04.512
We sinned, Jack.

59:06.107 --> 59:08.582
It's about redemption.

59:10.446 --> 59:12.553
But we're gonna have to pay.

59:15.217 --> 59:17.819
<i>It's called the Mind's Eye
Academy, Sheriff.</i>

59:17.919 --> 59:20.255
Yeah, this place is fucked!

59:20.355 --> 59:22.357
<i>How come you're out there?
I didn't get a call.</i>

59:22.457 --> 59:26.434
- I'll tell you all about it when I get back.
- <i>All right, copy that.</i>

59:45.681 --> 59:47.574
What can I do?

59:47.674 --> 59:49.378
Leave.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.616
I have the strength to handle this.

01:00:16.445 --> 01:00:19.353
I have the strength to handle this.

01:00:19.915 --> 01:00:22.741
I have the strength to handle this.

01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:26.834
I have the strength to handle this.

01:00:27.856 --> 01:00:30.698
I have the strength to handle this.

01:00:32.027 --> 01:00:34.196
I have the strength to handle this.

01:00:34.296 --> 01:00:35.970
Jack.

01:00:42.738 --> 01:00:44.945
How'd you come back?

01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:47.788
Because I missed you so much.

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:51.614
- You gave us no choice, Moira.
- Liar!

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:54.422
Don't take another step.

01:01:14.869 --> 01:01:17.373
Quiet, or I'll cut
your fucking tongue out, Jack!

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.975
- Eat what I tell you to eat!
- What?

01:01:20.275 --> 01:01:23.146
Eat what I tell you to eat,
when I tell you to eat it, right?

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:26.015
We were only trying to help you.

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:29.256
Stay down on your knees
and eat this fucking dirt.

01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:37.627
We attune ourselves to the desert,

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:40.511
to the Earth, and to the sky.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.146
Nobody's fed them.

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.248
Why are you worried
about the fucking horses?

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:03.223
They're not turning up cut to pieces
with words carved into their hooves.

01:02:04.386 --> 01:02:07.223
Everyone's saying they're gonna
send us home after this assembly.

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:11.160
I already called my mom,
she's coming to pick me up tomorrow.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.267
You should come with us.

01:02:17.999 --> 01:02:19.769
I want to.

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:24.211
But I have to make sure Kaitlin's okay.
I can't leave her.

01:02:43.872 --> 01:02:47.713
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm getting the fuck outta here.

01:02:47.963 --> 01:02:50.933
You can't just leave, Krauss,
we have to take care of these kids.

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.501
Are you kidding me?

01:02:52.601 --> 01:02:55.644
We are the last people that
should be taking care of these kids.

01:02:56.822 --> 01:03:00.489
Something bad is happening here.

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:02.211
You're scaring me, Krauss.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:05.480
You should be scared,
we made a terrible mistake.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:10.474
I just hope... that there's something
out there that can forgive us.

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.896
Forgive you.

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:52.333
Oh, shit.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:07.277
You're the dog that does
whatever he tells you to do.

01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:09.739
His follower.

01:04:13.448 --> 01:04:14.822
His bitch.

01:04:17.419 --> 01:04:20.180
I didn't wanna go through with it.

01:04:20.689 --> 01:04:23.964
- Please, Moira...
- There's always one of you.

01:04:24.693 --> 01:04:27.034
What do you want from me?

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.391
Your pain.

01:04:53.188 --> 01:04:55.729
Hey, hey!

01:04:56.091 --> 01:04:57.965
Hey!

01:05:04.099 --> 01:05:06.473
Help, help me!

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:10.973
Help me, help me.
Fucking Moira, she's back there!

01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:13.647
Bring him in, get him in.

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:20.318
Bitch!

01:05:21.646 --> 01:05:23.369
She's coming.

01:05:23.469 --> 01:05:25.880
You sure it was Moira?

01:05:27.489 --> 01:05:28.829
Yes.

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:35.970
Why are we fucking waiting
in the greenhouse?

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:41.540
This is fucking bullshit.

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:49.962
- You betrayed me, Lincoln.
- I said I don't need you anymore!

01:05:50.062 --> 01:05:53.404
- Kaitlin does.
- Come on, let's get the fuck outta here!

01:05:59.521 --> 01:06:01.061
I don't need you...

01:06:05.762 --> 01:06:08.783
Stop! I said stop!

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:11.367
Stop!

01:06:12.067 --> 01:06:14.041
Do you feel that?

01:06:18.173 --> 01:06:21.077
Go ahead, do it!

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:23.396
Do it!

01:06:34.956 --> 01:06:37.898
Now you know how it feels to be alone.

01:07:17.799 --> 01:07:19.778
- Tell me what's going on.
- No, we have no time.

01:07:19.878 --> 01:07:23.238
- We have to get everybody outta here.
- Shut up. Whose blood is on your shirt?

01:07:23.338 --> 01:07:25.957
- Isaac's. She killed him.
- Who?

01:07:26.057 --> 01:07:28.044
Moira Karp.

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.046
You fucking piece of shit liar.

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:33.289
- Please, just listen...
- Shut the fuck...

01:07:36.084 --> 01:07:39.121
- You killed Willie, didn't you?
- Please...

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:42.257
I'm calling the cops, and you're gonna
tell 'em what you fucking did.

01:07:42.357 --> 01:07:45.227
How you killed Willie and Derek,
and they're gonna put you away forever.

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:47.301
I didn't kill 'em!

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.278
Fuck.

01:08:08.314 --> 01:08:10.174
Moira?

01:08:12.807 --> 01:08:14.790
Try it.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.897
Help me.

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:20.783
You want me to cut her?

01:08:22.063 --> 01:08:24.549
I want you to kill her.

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:27.689
- She didn't do anything to you.
- They're all the same.

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:31.273
We can fix this, we'll tell everybody
what happened. We'll expose the truth.

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:32.813
Fuck the truth.

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:38.613
- You're evil.
- No, I am strong.

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:43.256
- I let them hurt me, but not anymore.
- I don't need you anymore.

01:08:44.786 --> 01:08:46.693
Please.

01:08:46.988 --> 01:08:49.462
Don't be like the rest.

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:53.000
I don't need you anymore. Go away.

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:57.453
You listen to me.
You said you wanted to help me!

01:09:00.283 --> 01:09:03.904
Go away! Go away!

01:09:04.005 --> 01:09:06.575
It worked for Lincoln, go away!

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:09.477
Stupid girl! I was just pretending!

01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:12.319
- I made you come back.
- The fuck you did!

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:17.055
Come on!

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.099
Fuck.

01:09:29.997 --> 01:09:32.471
Get away from me!

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:37.944
What are you doing?

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.790
You.

01:09:53.408 --> 01:09:58.192
You come any closer and I swear I'll blow
your fucking brains out, you little cunt.

01:09:59.227 --> 01:10:01.663
Did you lie to my parents
about how I died?

01:10:02.063 --> 01:10:04.799
- We had no choice.
- You had no choice?

01:10:05.199 --> 01:10:07.625
Do you remember the night
I died, Christine?

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:10.806
Say you remember.

01:10:11.306 --> 01:10:13.448
Do you remember how I died? Say it!

01:10:13.548 --> 01:10:15.644
I remember.

01:10:16.444 --> 01:10:18.580
The basement.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:23.056
The only place I felt safe from you
and your awful friends.

01:10:23.684 --> 01:10:25.854
I was cutting myself.

01:10:25.954 --> 01:10:28.829
Little cuts to control the pain.

01:10:29.824 --> 01:10:33.895
- I will shoot you in the fucking face.
- You were the worst!

01:10:33.995 --> 01:10:36.398
You made my life here hell!

01:10:37.298 --> 01:10:41.307
But Iverson let you
get away with everything!

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:45.507
You came down there to taunt me.

01:10:45.607 --> 01:10:49.249
To call me evil, and call me a cunt!

01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:55.761
And I couldn't take it anymore.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.959
So I attacked you.

01:10:59.487 --> 01:11:02.415
God, but I was so weak then.

01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:06.779
What happened next, Christine,
do you remember?

01:11:08.329 --> 01:11:10.265
- I cut you.
- That's right!

01:11:10.365 --> 01:11:13.802
You held me down and you took my blade,
and you slit me open.

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:16.928
Here! And here!

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:21.601
And then you all came down to watch.

01:11:22.443 --> 01:11:27.107
Iverson, Krauss... you.

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:32.926
I'm sorry.

01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:36.224
I didn't wanna die!

01:11:36.324 --> 01:11:38.693
I asked you to help me,
don't you remember?

01:11:38.793 --> 01:11:41.839
I said, "Help me, please!"

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:47.534
A troubled girl who killed herself.

01:11:47.634 --> 01:11:50.477
Iverson could make that work.

01:11:51.873 --> 01:11:54.143
And then you kicked me.

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:57.604
Just to see if I was dead yet.

01:11:57.704 --> 01:12:00.181
That's the last thing I remember,

01:12:00.281 --> 01:12:04.076
is your foot pressing into my chest!

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:10.759
- I don't wanna do this, Moira.
- Oh, I think you do.

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:14.370
- No, I don't.
- I think you want it bad.

01:12:16.931 --> 01:12:19.139
Come on, Christine.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:22.008
Let me feel your hate.

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:26.246
I'm so, so sorry.

01:12:34.315 --> 01:12:35.951
Come on!

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:38.125
Lincoln.

01:12:43.551 --> 01:12:45.598
Oh, fuck.

01:12:49.097 --> 01:12:53.365
I fucked everything up.
And I can't change that, but right now...

01:12:53.465 --> 01:12:56.371
I love you.
More than I've ever loved anyone,

01:12:56.471 --> 01:12:59.784
and if I'm going to die here,
I need you to believe that.

01:13:02.343 --> 01:13:03.870
You're not gonna die.

01:13:06.982 --> 01:13:08.822
Shit.

01:13:10.985 --> 01:13:13.426
None of this shit's gonna help us.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.887
You fucking traitors!

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:52.189
My life was hell
because of girls like you.

01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:57.392
Moira!

01:14:57.892 --> 01:15:00.100
What's it gonna take to stop you?

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.371
Everybody dying.

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:08.207
Oh, I dare you.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.816
Let's die together, Lincoln.

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.454
I'm not afraid of you.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.346
You should be.

01:15:32.957 --> 01:15:34.792
Moira!

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:44.010
Lincoln, no!

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:26.886
Lincoln, no!

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:33.802
Lincoln!

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:10.392
I can't believe you did that.
Please look at me.

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:12.272
Lincoln, look at me.

01:17:12.372 --> 01:17:14.902
Lincoln, look at me.
You're gonna be okay.

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:30.147
I wish they were all dead.

01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:32.966
I wish they were all dead.

01:20:34.562 --> 01:20:36.065
I wish they were all dead.

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:40.260
They'll never fuck with us, again.
