00:06.000 --> 00:07.500
<i> Previously on</i> The Recruit:

00:07.583 --> 00:09.833
-New guys get the shit work.
-The hell is this?

00:09.916 --> 00:13.958
People graymail the CIA. Vet the letters,
see if the author can back up the threat.

00:14.041 --> 00:17.666
<i>My name is Max Meladze.</i>
<i>I'm in prison in Phoenix.</i>

00:17.750 --> 00:19.833
<i>Get me out or I will spill agency secrets.</i>

00:19.916 --> 00:21.958
Sir, she clearly knows
classified information.

00:22.041 --> 00:25.208
Selby Shaw is a pseudonym
for Dawn Gilbane.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.083
-Where is she?
-How do I get to Yemen?

00:27.166 --> 00:29.125
Travel coach. Rent an economy car.

00:29.208 --> 00:30.875
Since when do spies
fly commercial?

00:30.958 --> 00:33.000
I'm not a spy, I am a lawyer.

00:33.083 --> 00:35.916
-God!
-I think you're here to investigate us.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.875
Oh, fuck!

00:37.958 --> 00:39.250
Asset's name is Max Meladze.

00:39.333 --> 00:42.333
That somebody would hip-pocket
a girl like that should scare you.

00:42.416 --> 00:43.916
I have classified CIA documents.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.625
-They're in a storage locker.
-We'll take the bag.

00:48.291 --> 00:50.708
Who the fuck booby-traps a bag with acid?

00:50.791 --> 00:51.791
A survivor.

00:51.875 --> 00:54.875
So I spent the afternoon
going through your social media.

00:54.958 --> 00:57.333
Now I know every woman you've dated.

00:57.416 --> 00:59.958
I feel that her threat
of graymail is credible.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.583
I'm gonna ask you one question.
Can I trust you?

01:02.666 --> 01:04.666
-When our interests align.
-I'm in.

01:50.666 --> 01:54.375
Your black cash,
clean as a whistle.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.791
Where is my treat?

01:57.541 --> 01:58.458
On his way.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.541
I don't like to wait.

02:00.625 --> 02:04.458
Sometimes, waiting is the best part.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.583
I hate the opera.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.541
I'm wheels up for Moscow at intermission.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.916
The deputy has his nuts in a twist
about Havana.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.208
He's threatening to send Guryev down here.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.583
Don't worry.

02:31.541 --> 02:33.583
You're late. He's in a mood.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.583
He's always in a mood.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.833
What's wrong?

02:42.583 --> 02:44.125
I'm not supposed to say.

02:47.666 --> 02:49.625
The council is meeting about you.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.083
Do you know why?

02:59.250 --> 03:01.666
I'm sure I can smooth it over.

03:05.208 --> 03:06.375
How do I look?

03:08.166 --> 03:09.666
Like a movie star.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.291
Yes.

03:24.375 --> 03:27.208
You got a problem.
The Obshchak put a price on your head.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.541
<i>-They're coming to kill you.</i>
-They found out I'm spying?

03:31.208 --> 03:34.000
No. As far as we can tell,
they don't know you work for us.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.541
<i>You just got too ambitious too fast.</i>
<i>Stepped on the wrong toes.</i>

04:02.208 --> 04:03.291
Go away.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.000
I can fix this.

04:05.083 --> 04:07.375
No. You can run or you can die.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.291
End of the road, Max.

04:15.416 --> 04:18.833
-You've been paid extra to make it hurt.
-No. That part's for free.

05:10.541 --> 05:11.875
<i> Still with us?</i>

05:14.416 --> 05:15.416
Yes.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.083
-You have to help me.
<i>-I don't have to do anything.</i>

05:21.166 --> 05:22.125
<i>You're not my asset.</i>

05:22.791 --> 05:25.541
But you got me out of a jam once.
So I'll return the favor.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.250
<i>There's an exit package waiting for you</i>
<i>at the airport.</i>

05:28.333 --> 05:32.041
<i>-A place for you lay low in the U.S.</i>
-But I don't want to go to America.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.000
Okay. I'm hanging up now.

05:34.083 --> 05:34.916
<i>Wait.</i>

05:37.125 --> 05:38.000
I'll go.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.291
But don't abandon me.

05:41.958 --> 05:43.583
<i> Would you like to leave a message?</i>

05:43.666 --> 05:47.083
No, I have already left a dozen messages.

05:48.125 --> 05:51.083
Look, you've had me trapped here
in this shithole for over a month.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.958
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am. Without a name,</i>
<i>there's nothing I can do.</i>

05:54.041 --> 05:56.166
<i>The CIA has thousands of employees.</i>

05:56.250 --> 05:59.791
He's a spy, you fucking idiot.
I don't know his real name.

06:00.791 --> 06:03.375
And I know things. Secret things.

06:03.916 --> 06:07.541
<i>Yes, ma'am. Please hold</i>
<i>while I send you to general voicemail.</i>

06:28.291 --> 06:31.208
-You were subpoenaed by the Senate?
-Yesterday.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.375
They spelled your name wrong.

06:34.458 --> 06:37.291
If only that meant that I could ignore it.

06:37.375 --> 06:41.458
Oh, you can. If you wanna go to jail
for contempt of Congress.

06:42.458 --> 06:45.958
Owen, this is serious.
You've been at the agency for a week,

06:46.041 --> 06:48.208
and already pissed off
the Senate Intelligence Committee.

06:48.291 --> 06:50.583
That's the least of my issues.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.291
What does that mean?

06:52.916 --> 06:55.041
Yo, what's going on?

06:55.125 --> 06:57.416
Owen is in over his head again.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.791
-Such an overachiever. Way to go, buddy.
-Thanks, man.

07:02.875 --> 07:05.500
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
then neither am I.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.458
Hey, innocent question.

07:08.125 --> 07:11.166
Did your firm teach you
how to deal with a client you can't trust?

07:11.250 --> 07:13.833
Your client is the CIA.

07:14.916 --> 07:15.750
Yeah.

07:15.833 --> 07:19.083
Isn't that a question
for your supervisors or coworkers?

07:21.416 --> 07:24.041
-You don't trust them either.
-Owen, this isn't law school.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.541
You can't just roll in
and ace the exam last minute.

07:26.625 --> 07:30.125
-Not when the stakes are this high.
-It's worked for me until now.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.500
Has it?

07:31.583 --> 07:32.750
Look, just--

07:32.833 --> 07:35.208
Higher stakes make it more challenging.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.791
But the bottom line is,
it's no different than any other problem.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.541
So as soon as I figure out the system,
I'll be able to navigate the obstacles.

07:41.625 --> 07:45.166
He'll just gonna run headfirst into
those obstacles if we don't help him.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.458
I think the correct term is "enable."

07:48.666 --> 07:51.250
Okay. Job number one
is to protect yourself.

07:51.333 --> 07:54.666
The only way to do that
is to do your homework for once.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.166
If you can find the truth,
it won't matter if your client lies.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.041
-And don't ask what is truth.
-Wasn't going to.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.750
-So knowledge is power. Got it.
-Nope. Knowledge is leverage.

08:07.916 --> 08:08.750
Hannah.

08:09.875 --> 08:11.833
Oh, Hannah!

08:13.708 --> 08:15.625
Where are you? Hey-- Oh! Hi.

08:15.708 --> 08:18.750
Do you have any more Adderall
that you can spare?

08:18.833 --> 08:19.750
It's not for me.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.333
You mean besides
half the bottle you've already stolen?

08:22.416 --> 08:24.375
"Stolen" is such an ugly word.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.875
Seriously, it's for a coworker.
Don't make it weird.

08:27.375 --> 08:30.333
Okay, fine.
Just take the bottle. But that's it.

08:30.416 --> 08:32.458
After this, I booby-trap my purse.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.833
You're the best. Thank you.

08:39.916 --> 08:42.291
-Yeah.
-I'll see you tonight or tomorrow.

08:42.791 --> 08:46.125
Maybe two days. I should probably pack
an overnight, just in case.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.166
Hello!

09:02.250 --> 09:03.875
Where's my money?

09:04.458 --> 09:06.083
How'd you get this number?

09:06.166 --> 09:08.000
Where the fuck is my money?

09:08.083 --> 09:11.833
I told you to leave it in a bag
and put it in the garbage can

09:11.916 --> 09:13.500
<i>so my associate could retrieve it.</i>

09:13.583 --> 09:15.500
-And I did.
<i>-You're lying.</i>

09:15.583 --> 09:18.083
But you're good at it,
we have that in common.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.958
<i>Yeah. You're a criminal and a murderer.</i>

09:20.041 --> 09:22.500
<i>So I'm not really looking to identify</i>
<i>things we have in common.</i>

09:22.583 --> 09:24.416
<i>Plus, ever since I've met you,</i>

09:24.500 --> 09:27.208
I have been chased,
tortured, and subpoenaed,

09:27.291 --> 09:29.166
which I'm discovering are real turn-offs.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.333
And yet, things are only gonna get
more painful for you

09:31.416 --> 09:34.125
if you don't get me the fuck out of here.

09:34.208 --> 09:37.041
I'm working on it. It's not like
I'm fixing a speeding ticket.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.791
<i>It would make my life</i>
<i>a hell of a lot easier</i>

09:38.875 --> 09:41.625
<i>if I knew what classified information</i>
<i>you're threatening to reveal.</i>

09:41.708 --> 09:43.416
What operations were you even involved in?

09:43.500 --> 09:47.291
Owen, you want me to tell you that
information over an unsecured cell phone?

09:47.375 --> 09:50.000
No. But I'll fly to you.
I'll come right now.

09:50.083 --> 09:54.291
No. The next time I see you,
you'll be driving me away from here.

09:54.375 --> 09:57.000
<i>Otherwise, you'll be getting</i>
<i>all your answers from CNN.</i>

09:57.083 --> 09:58.625
-Wait--

10:03.666 --> 10:05.125
Excuse me. Excuse me.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.541
Is this the Records Department?

10:09.875 --> 10:13.208
Amazing. Owen Hendricks.
I'm with the General Counsel's office.

10:13.291 --> 10:14.750
I need some help with my homework.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.583
-I gotta run a records search.
-Lucky me.

10:17.666 --> 10:19.541
Yeah. Question, if I ran a name

10:19.625 --> 10:22.208
by Clandestine Services yesterday
and they came up empty,

10:22.291 --> 10:25.541
do I have a reason to believe that you
might give me a different answer today?

10:25.625 --> 10:28.708
Possibly. Certain high-level classified
material's kept out of the main database.

10:28.791 --> 10:32.458
You mean the stuff they try to hide,
the really fucked-up shit?

10:32.541 --> 10:33.541
No comment.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.458
How do I run a name?

10:36.875 --> 10:40.750
Fill out forms 1117A, 2061H, and 3108F

10:40.833 --> 10:43.250
and get signatures in triplicate
from your supervisor.

10:44.541 --> 10:47.250
-Uh, do you have--?
-I'm kidding. What's the name?

10:48.208 --> 10:50.958
Last name is Meladze. M-E-L-A-D-Z-E.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.541
First name is Maxine.

10:53.041 --> 10:55.000
-Also known as Max.
-What region?

10:55.083 --> 10:56.000
Eastern Europe.

11:01.916 --> 11:04.166
Should I just--
Do you want me to wait here?

11:05.041 --> 11:07.166
This computer was built in 1996,

11:07.250 --> 11:09.958
and I'm gonna have to dig through
hard files even if I get a hit.

11:10.041 --> 11:12.541
So, why don't you write down
your contact info

11:12.625 --> 11:15.250
and if anything comes up,
we'll deliver it to your office.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.375
He's coming.

11:21.958 --> 11:23.000
No, he's not.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.125
Yes, he is.

11:30.208 --> 11:33.708
Guys, this is my office.
You know that, right? Mine.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.791
We're here to extend an olive branch.

11:36.875 --> 11:39.125
We felt like we didn't
prepare you well for Yemen,

11:39.208 --> 11:42.416
and word is you're in over your head
with this graymail case.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.250
-Yeah? Who told you that?
-It's not important.

11:45.333 --> 11:49.541
But what is important is that you feel
you have the tools you need to succeed.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.541
So how can we help?

11:52.875 --> 11:55.958
Super nice of you guys,
but I'm all set, for now.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.208
Good. Good.

11:57.291 --> 12:00.625
Because if you need anything,
we are here to support you.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.208
Yep. Thank you.

12:02.291 --> 12:03.291
Oh, and--

12:03.375 --> 12:06.000
Lester and I,
we were actually talking earlier,

12:06.083 --> 12:10.250
and we realized you probably
haven't had the dating conversation yet.

12:11.166 --> 12:15.250
Actually, Mom and Dad, they covered that
thoroughly in sixth-grade sex-ed.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.375
So...

12:17.125 --> 12:18.416
No, no.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.208
We just wanna teach you
how this place works.

12:21.291 --> 12:22.458
-Why?
-Paperwork.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.416
Or to avoid paperwork.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.625
There's onerous reporting requirements
for any personal interaction.

12:28.708 --> 12:30.250
I thought that was for foreigners?

12:30.333 --> 12:33.791
No, it's anyone with whom you have
close and continuing contact.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.541
And that means without a condom.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.750
-You always wear a condom, right?
-Wearing one now.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.625
Okay.

12:41.708 --> 12:44.333
So Lester and I
have worked here for a while,

12:44.416 --> 12:46.375
and we know most of the single women.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.625
We can help you steer clear of the loons.

12:48.708 --> 12:52.541
Love that. I'll make sure to call you guys
first if I get back in the game.

12:52.625 --> 12:56.500
Great. Um, and it is staff meeting time.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.500
-It's your first, right?
-Yeah.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.416
-Nice.
-Why?

13:01.500 --> 13:02.333
Why?

13:02.416 --> 13:03.833
<i> Goddamn it!</i>

13:03.916 --> 13:05.000
Who did it?

13:07.708 --> 13:10.333
Which one of you
screwed the pooch this time?

13:17.041 --> 13:17.916
Just kidding.

13:20.291 --> 13:22.041
Good poker faces, everybody.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.041
Except for you, Maeson.

13:27.041 --> 13:29.375
-I could see you pucker up.
-Sorry, sir.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.250
N-L-T-S-Y-P.

13:31.916 --> 13:32.791
"Never...

13:33.583 --> 13:35.083
Let Them See You Pucker."

13:37.541 --> 13:38.375
Okay.

13:39.458 --> 13:42.791
Violet, what's the latest
on the thing with those people?

13:43.458 --> 13:48.458
Our friend in the place says there may be
heavy seas ahead, but no storm.

13:48.541 --> 13:52.458
Good. Salazar, any problems
with the framing on those deliverables?

13:52.541 --> 13:53.375
Not so far.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.250
Our friend is hearing whispers

13:55.333 --> 13:58.291
that the element
we were worried about didn't materialize.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.791
Good, keep an eye on it.

14:00.791 --> 14:03.166
Our friend might be working
a different agenda.

14:03.958 --> 14:08.208
Janus, why am I hearing about
upset stomachs in camel country?

14:10.375 --> 14:11.333
Hey.

14:12.750 --> 14:13.958
Knock it off.

14:14.041 --> 14:17.958
Nobody's buying the narcolepsy crap.
I don't care what your doctor's note says.

14:18.041 --> 14:19.416
Is this thing gonna be a problem?

14:19.500 --> 14:24.208
Sir, I am unaware of anything going on
in the region that you mentioned.

14:24.291 --> 14:26.750
Let me do my due diligence,
and I will get right back to you.

14:26.833 --> 14:30.458
-Fuck that, just fix it.
-Mm-hm. All right. Yes, sir.

14:31.125 --> 14:31.958
Hendricks.

14:32.750 --> 14:34.541
Any more definition on that...

14:35.166 --> 14:36.000
squeaky wheel?

14:37.916 --> 14:38.750
The what?

14:41.625 --> 14:42.708
Oh, my-- Um...

14:44.375 --> 14:48.958
Uh, per our last conversation,
I made contact with the former asset.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.166
Whoa.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.458
-TMI.
-What--?

14:53.333 --> 14:54.416
Sorry. I'm sorry.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.041
The person in the place...

14:57.125 --> 15:00.750
and I am trying to get clarity
on how deep their--

15:00.833 --> 15:04.125
Their knowledge goes
into the Russian mob--

15:04.208 --> 15:06.333
-Oh, my God.
-What?

15:14.500 --> 15:17.916
-What's happening? What happened?
-They don't want your shit on their shoes.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.208
Violet, have you taught him anything?

15:20.291 --> 15:23.750
He is a slow learner, sir.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.000
Everything we work on

15:26.083 --> 15:28.458
has the potential to get us hauled
in front of the SSCI,

15:28.541 --> 15:31.250
so it's common fucking courtesy
not to overshare.

15:31.333 --> 15:34.833
No one wants to be in-the-know
unless they have to.

15:34.916 --> 15:36.583
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir.

15:36.666 --> 15:39.833
So do you have a plan of action
for this woman or not?

15:40.625 --> 15:42.208
No, not yet.

15:42.291 --> 15:45.791
But I know you wouldn't want me to act
without doing a proper risk assessment.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.958
I have multiple feelers out. I should
have a much clearer picture shortly.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.500
Sweet.

16:10.666 --> 16:13.375
I can get you a zip.
It's gonna cost you 200.

16:13.958 --> 16:15.458
That's too much.

16:15.541 --> 16:16.750
I'll pay you back.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.041
Shit!

16:39.083 --> 16:40.250
Hey!

16:41.291 --> 16:42.416
Break it up!

16:51.791 --> 16:52.625
Janus.

16:53.416 --> 16:54.375
Go away.

16:54.958 --> 16:58.250
Well, I would love to,
but I need some advice.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.041
Forget it. You're dead to me.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.583
Ship sailed on those, new guy.

17:06.666 --> 17:09.666
I don't need to stay awake anymore.
The worst already happened.

17:10.583 --> 17:11.416
Did it?

17:12.625 --> 17:15.166
Seems like the way
that Nyland was so angry,

17:15.250 --> 17:18.583
the worst would be
if he found out you lied to him again.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.416
Are you threatening me?

17:22.500 --> 17:25.750
No, I'm just getting a feel
for how to navigate the place I guess.

17:28.958 --> 17:30.125
What do you want to know?

17:30.208 --> 17:33.625
Why can't I find an official record
of my graymailer in the archives?

17:33.708 --> 17:36.000
Even if she was a hip-pocket asset,

17:36.083 --> 17:39.708
her HUMINT was the basis of operations
over the span of years.

17:39.791 --> 17:41.583
Someone cleaned up their mess.

17:42.083 --> 17:44.333
Someone? Like her handler? Not Bob?

17:45.208 --> 17:47.708
I don't know. I am not going there.

17:47.791 --> 17:50.125
No matter what you threaten me with,
and neither should you.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.833
A guy like that finds out
you're poking around his old ops,

17:52.916 --> 17:55.958
and you end up in a dark room wondering
why there's plastic on the floor.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.000
I'm in a minefield.

17:57.750 --> 18:01.583
The only way I survive is
if I figure out what the hell she knows.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.000
You need her hall file.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.541
-What's a hall file?
-RUMINT.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.500
Rumors Intelligence.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.541
Okay, how do I find that?

18:14.625 --> 18:16.708
A hall file isn't a physical file.

18:16.791 --> 18:17.708
It's gossip.

18:18.291 --> 18:21.791
Things that were said in the halls of
whatever station she was handled out of.

18:21.875 --> 18:25.125
-She was an asset in Belarus.
-Doesn't mean that was her station.

18:25.208 --> 18:29.333
Which means you need to figure that out
in order to target a case officer

18:29.416 --> 18:31.666
who might be willing
to talk to you about her.

18:34.750 --> 18:35.583
What?

18:37.583 --> 18:39.375
No. He isn't in here, why?

18:44.875 --> 18:48.916
-Max Meladze was just shanked in prison.
-Who?

18:49.958 --> 18:51.708
-My squeaky wheel.
-And?

18:51.791 --> 18:52.625
Is she dead?

18:53.708 --> 18:55.291
No, but she's pissed.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.583
-Sir, I have to know--
-Know what?

18:58.458 --> 18:59.958
-Did we--?
-Did we what?

19:00.958 --> 19:01.791
Did we do it?

19:04.125 --> 19:07.208
Are you asking the General Counsel
of the CIA whether the Company,

19:07.291 --> 19:09.750
which is legally prohibited
from operating in the U.S.,

19:09.833 --> 19:14.875
attempted to murder a foreign national
and former asset in Ari-fucking-zona?

19:15.666 --> 19:16.500
Nope.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.083
I didn't think so.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.708
Listen to me carefully, Mr. Hendricks.

19:20.791 --> 19:22.708
I can't afford for this to be a problem.

19:22.791 --> 19:25.375
Senator Smoot is looking
to hang a scandal around my neck

19:25.458 --> 19:27.291
so I'll be forced to resign in disgrace.

19:27.375 --> 19:31.500
And the last thing I need is for your
squeaky wheel to turn into that scandal.

19:31.583 --> 19:34.416
So you get this under control
no matter what it takes.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.333
Yes, sir.

19:36.541 --> 19:39.333
-I knew packing a bag was the right call.
-What?

19:40.458 --> 19:42.958
Nothing. I'm on it. Have no fear.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.375
Fear's literally all I have.

20:02.125 --> 20:02.958
Ouch.

20:03.541 --> 20:06.291
She's lucky.
Shank missed everything important.

20:06.791 --> 20:08.041
-You her lawyer?
-No.

20:08.125 --> 20:08.958
Yes.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.250
Interesting.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.416
I need to talk to her in private.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.958
That's not gonna happen.

20:30.708 --> 20:31.541
Come on.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.500
Five minutes.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.166
The shanking wasn't us.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.833
I know. It's Talco in retaliation
for burning his face with acid.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.416
That was pretty terrible.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.625
-But you guys are even now, right?
-No.

20:59.708 --> 21:03.625
He's gonna carry on trying to kill me.
Which is a problem for both of us.

21:09.416 --> 21:12.458
Why didn't you graymail the agency
when you first got to America?

21:12.541 --> 21:13.708
Why wait until now?

21:14.541 --> 21:15.875
Because I want to go home.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.000
You're exposed as a former asset,
you can't do that.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.291
You're keeping me in the dark

21:20.375 --> 21:24.166
because you think if you control
the information that gets out,

21:24.250 --> 21:25.833
you get to keep your duplicity a secret.

21:25.916 --> 21:27.833
You go back to your old life in Belarus.

21:27.916 --> 21:31.916
And if you expose everything,
then that door closes forever.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.666
You need me to help you
thread that needle.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.083
No. Promises were made.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.791
I expect to be taken care of.

21:38.625 --> 21:42.375
But make no mistake,
I will burn this place down if I have to.

21:42.458 --> 21:43.541
Starting with you.

21:46.916 --> 21:49.833
Look, I don't wanna spend
the rest of my life in prison.

21:50.541 --> 21:52.458
This is not my future.

21:52.541 --> 21:53.375
Well, then...

21:54.416 --> 21:56.333
you're gonna have to
negotiate a truce with Talco.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.958
I can't do that. Not from in here.

21:58.041 --> 22:01.583
-So you're gonna have to do that.
-No, it's not part of my job description.

22:01.666 --> 22:02.791
Sorry.

22:02.875 --> 22:04.666
We made a deal, so...

22:05.375 --> 22:07.000
you help me, I'll help you.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.000
What do you need help with?

22:09.750 --> 22:10.666
Nothing.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.916
Unless you know about Senate subpoenas.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.333
Well, I know about power and politics.

22:18.375 --> 22:19.416
All right.

22:20.625 --> 22:23.083
There's this hotshot senator,
he hates my boss.

22:23.166 --> 22:26.208
So he subpoenaed me so I have to
go testify just to fuck with him.

22:26.291 --> 22:28.833
Well, he doesn't want you to testify.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.125
What do you mean?

22:31.208 --> 22:34.833
The subpoena is leverage for you
to give him dirt on your boss.

22:34.916 --> 22:36.625
Just do that, subpoena goes away.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.875
-Oh, that is so much worse.

22:40.375 --> 22:41.708
Yeah, well, you asked.

22:45.125 --> 22:46.500
So, um...

22:47.833 --> 22:52.250
I will get word to Talco
and you will prepare a peace agreement.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.500
-You know how to do that?
-Yeah.

22:55.333 --> 23:00.208
Talked my way out of being kidnapped
by pirates in Guyana. Spring break. Crazy.

23:35.875 --> 23:36.875
Violet Ebner.

23:36.958 --> 23:38.666
Hey, it's me, Owen.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.000
I could use a little bit of advice
if the offer still stands.

23:42.083 --> 23:43.500
Absolutely.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.916
<i>I need to get my graymail case</i>
<i>moved into the federal system.</i>

23:46.000 --> 23:47.958
-It's Owen.
-<i>How do I do that?</i>

23:48.041 --> 23:50.458
-What part of the country?
-Arizona.

23:51.375 --> 23:55.000
You know what, let me grab Lester.
He's had some interactions down there.

23:55.083 --> 23:55.916
Okay.

24:03.625 --> 24:05.333
Owen needs to make
his graymail case federal.

24:05.416 --> 24:07.875
This is our opportunity
to get someone in close to him.

24:07.958 --> 24:10.375
-Catherine.
-No. I was thinking Amelia.

24:10.458 --> 24:13.333
Oh, Amelia's gonna tear him apart.

24:13.916 --> 24:16.125
She'll want something from us in return
for spying on him.

24:16.208 --> 24:19.000
Are you kidding me?
She's gonna thank us for the hookup.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.166
Trust me, the kid's a stud.

24:22.291 --> 24:24.500
Okay. So I talked to Lester,

24:24.583 --> 24:27.958
<i>and unfortunately, he doesn't have</i>
<i>any connections in the Southwest.</i>

24:28.041 --> 24:31.166
<i>But Amelia Salazar used to be an AUSA,</i>

24:31.250 --> 24:34.166
and I'm sure she's got
a lot of pull down there.

24:34.958 --> 24:38.666
-Amazing. Can you connect us?
<i>-Well, she's gone for the day.</i>

24:38.750 --> 24:40.708
But I can introduce you tomorrow.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.500
<i>Thanks.</i>

24:42.583 --> 24:44.125
I owe you.

24:44.791 --> 24:47.625
Not at all. We're on the same team.

24:48.541 --> 24:50.333
That's what I'm talking about.

25:03.541 --> 25:04.375
Excuse me.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.416
-What?
-Sorry.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.916
I just checked in and couldn't help
but notice that you're eating takeout.

25:10.000 --> 25:10.833
I'm starving.

25:12.333 --> 25:16.500
-How are the chicken nuggets? Any good?
-Well, I'm not even sure they're chicken.

25:20.583 --> 25:21.416
Yeah.

25:29.166 --> 25:32.250
Okay. Now you have to sacrifice
one to the pool gods.

25:35.208 --> 25:38.208
What is that? A good luck thing
or a ward off evil spirit thing?

25:38.291 --> 25:40.958
It is a useless act of destruction thing.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.000
You mind if I sit?

25:43.958 --> 25:44.791
Go ahead.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.916
So, what brings you to this 5-star resort?

25:55.916 --> 25:59.333
I'm a lawyer in town for a case.
I fly out in the morning.

26:01.916 --> 26:03.208
What about you?

26:03.291 --> 26:04.583
Been here long?

26:06.458 --> 26:07.458
Couple days.

26:09.666 --> 26:11.000
For work or play?

26:12.291 --> 26:14.208
-Family.
-I can relate.

26:15.166 --> 26:16.875
I haven't seen mine since law school.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.833
My mom just got too unstable.

26:19.916 --> 26:22.708
I don't know.
I feel guilty about it sometimes.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.541
Truth is, I'm just making it worse
trying to make it better.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.250
Why are you telling me that?

26:29.333 --> 26:31.708
It's safer being honest
with strangers, I guess.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.291
I mean, I'm never gonna
see you again, right?

26:34.375 --> 26:36.166
So I don't give a shit if you judge me.

26:36.875 --> 26:38.333
You should try it.

26:43.000 --> 26:43.833
My...

26:45.041 --> 26:46.750
dad was killed recently.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.125
He was the only one who made me feel safe.

26:52.833 --> 26:54.208
Sane, loved.

26:56.541 --> 26:58.291
My father died when I was 12.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.625
Went to war and never came back.
It's what broke my mom.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.458
I tried so hard to, like...

27:08.791 --> 27:12.208
be the man in the house,
you know, be just like him, but...

27:23.000 --> 27:23.916
Oh...

27:24.583 --> 27:26.833
Thought that we were gonna
do this in the morning?

27:42.583 --> 27:45.500
It looks good on you.
You can keep it if you want.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.291
You think I need your permission?

27:49.583 --> 27:51.375
In this moment, probably not.

27:54.541 --> 27:56.458
-Where's my money?
-It's safe.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.166
Cut the tape. Let's go get it.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.875
What happened to your hand?

28:01.583 --> 28:05.916
Oh, I got my fingernail pulled out.
A similar situation to this, actually.

28:06.416 --> 28:09.958
-Coin toss on which place was cleaner.
-Pulling fingernails out is for pussies.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.333
Psychological studies show it's
only the threat of permanent damage...

28:16.833 --> 28:18.833
that motivates a <i>pendejo...</i>

28:19.458 --> 28:21.125
to betray his own interests.

28:24.208 --> 28:26.958
So where's my money?

28:27.041 --> 28:28.125
I told you.

28:30.958 --> 28:33.750
In the parking lot of Perryville Prison.
You won't find it without me.

28:33.833 --> 28:34.750
That's not gonna happen

28:34.833 --> 28:36.833
-if you drill a bunch of holes.
-How many is a bunch?

28:36.916 --> 28:37.750
Any!

28:38.416 --> 28:41.208
Any holes. I'm not playing with you.
I don't work for Max.

28:41.291 --> 28:43.875
I don't care about her money,
she doesn't care about me,

28:43.958 --> 28:47.208
so cut the fucking tape
and let's get out of each other's lives.

28:57.166 --> 28:59.250
So how long you known Max?

29:01.250 --> 29:05.458
It's in your best interest to give me
all the intel you know on her.

29:05.541 --> 29:08.041
-Yeah?
-Sort of an enemy of my enemy thing.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.291
-You think we're gonna be friends?
-No.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.208
I hope we never see each other again.

29:14.041 --> 29:17.333
But if I play things right,
I get her out of both of our lives.

29:23.125 --> 29:25.916
Max created a niche business
when she hit town.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.916
But she crossed the line with that money.
Took something that didn't belong to her.

29:31.666 --> 29:33.583
She'll betray you just the same.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.375
That's good to know.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.166
No, no, no, no.

30:03.250 --> 30:05.875
Point it away from me and open it.

30:13.375 --> 30:14.458
Hey. Whoa!

30:15.583 --> 30:16.666
Not cool, man.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.791
-You and Max square?
-Yeah.

30:23.833 --> 30:27.083
-Hey. What are you doing? You can't--
-Back up. Back up.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.208
It's a rental, man!

31:34.291 --> 31:36.750
Relax. I'm not here to hurt you.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.750
Soldiers can't be blamed
for the orders they are given.

31:42.458 --> 31:44.750
I was curious about you, though,

31:45.458 --> 31:47.250
so I did some investigating.

31:48.583 --> 31:49.666
Your daughter...

31:51.125 --> 31:52.500
she's beautiful.

31:54.208 --> 31:56.666
Oh, no. Don't worry, I--

31:57.416 --> 31:59.000
I would never hurt her.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.291
I had a daughter of my own once.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.666
Nothing compares to it.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.583
The joy when they're sweet.

32:08.458 --> 32:10.291
The madness when they're not.

32:12.083 --> 32:15.208
She was a handful, my Karolina.

32:16.166 --> 32:17.125
Willful.

32:17.833 --> 32:19.000
So stubborn.

32:20.083 --> 32:24.000
Everything a girl needs
to survive in this world.

32:25.250 --> 32:27.291
But I don't need to tell you that.

32:30.041 --> 32:33.916
I say all of this because I want you
to know that I would never

32:34.000 --> 32:36.208
harm a hair on your daughter's head.

32:38.083 --> 32:41.666
But I will kill
everyone else in your family

32:41.750 --> 32:43.666
unless you start working for me.

32:44.708 --> 32:45.958
A double agent.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.958
You feed Talco lies.

32:49.708 --> 32:51.416
Tell me what he's up to.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.083
Warn me if he tries to kill me again.

32:56.416 --> 32:57.416
Can you do that?

33:01.250 --> 33:02.458
Can you do that?

33:05.583 --> 33:06.625
Okay, good.

33:09.708 --> 33:14.083
You rest up, and I'll say a prayer
for your <i>malyshka</i> tonight.

33:47.916 --> 33:51.291
-You're supposed to be at work.
-Okay, yeah, so are you.

33:51.375 --> 33:52.500
Look away.

33:56.708 --> 33:58.041
I called in sick.

33:58.750 --> 34:02.791
I couldn't take another day of document
discovery in a subzero conference room.

34:02.875 --> 34:06.000
I just got back from the airport.
I gotta shower, head to the office.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.041
I was gonna make pizza bagels.

34:17.541 --> 34:19.333
Oh! Yes, please.

34:23.708 --> 34:27.458
So how's the hunt for the truth going?

34:27.541 --> 34:28.458
Oh, it's great.

34:29.458 --> 34:30.416
Not great.

34:30.500 --> 34:34.166
Which isn't surprising in a place
that keeps secrets professionally.

34:36.250 --> 34:37.083
What?

34:39.041 --> 34:42.000
Look, I don't wanna be that girl
who says she's worried about you,

34:42.083 --> 34:44.458
because who wants to be that girl?

34:45.750 --> 34:47.291
But I'm worried about you.

34:48.166 --> 34:50.250
This need to jump into the deep end

34:50.333 --> 34:53.458
to prove yourself over and over again,
it's unhealthy.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.666
-I think it's ambitious.
-No.

34:56.208 --> 34:59.000
I'm ambitious. You're just afraid.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.375
It feels different.

35:00.458 --> 35:02.458
Afraid? Afraid of what?

35:02.541 --> 35:03.708
I don't know.

35:03.791 --> 35:05.916
Like, I honestly don't know.

35:06.625 --> 35:07.458
I mean,

35:09.833 --> 35:12.500
-why did you take a job at the CIA?
-Because--

35:12.583 --> 35:16.708
And don't say it was because
you wanted to get your hands dirty.

35:16.791 --> 35:18.708
You had no idea what that meant.

35:19.708 --> 35:23.625
Or here's an easier one.
Why did you even wanna be a lawyer?

35:24.375 --> 35:25.250
You know why.

35:26.208 --> 35:27.250
-No.
-Mm-hm.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.083
I know the story you tell yourself.

35:29.583 --> 35:32.291
But proving your crazy mother wrong
can't be the only reason

35:32.375 --> 35:34.458
why you make extreme life choices.

35:35.375 --> 35:38.208
-What if it is?
-That would be extremely dumb.

35:38.291 --> 35:40.000
What do you want me to do?

35:40.083 --> 35:42.250
Seriously, what do you
want me to do? Quit?

35:42.333 --> 35:44.125
When I haven't accomplished anything?

35:44.208 --> 35:46.625
God, Owen, you're allowed
to admit you've made a mistake.

35:46.708 --> 35:48.083
I have no problem doing that.

35:48.166 --> 35:50.500
I'm 24, I'm supposed to make mistakes.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.000
Take big swings.

35:52.083 --> 35:52.916
Right?

35:54.375 --> 35:55.208
Yeah.

35:57.916 --> 36:01.416
I just worry that the CIA
is gonna amplify your worst instincts.

36:02.750 --> 36:06.208
There are firms on K Street
that would snap you up in a second.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.625
They would pay you a fortune.

36:08.708 --> 36:11.291
Yeah. Clearly, you're so happy
doing corporate law.

36:11.375 --> 36:12.583
I'd love to do that too.

36:12.666 --> 36:16.875
Okay. At least I don't need to worry
about misspelled Senate subpoenas.

36:21.125 --> 36:22.250
Misspelled.

36:23.750 --> 36:24.583
What?

36:25.541 --> 36:27.041
That's how I find her.

36:27.125 --> 36:27.958
I have to go.

36:28.750 --> 36:32.000
I love that you care about me
and you want me to be safe.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.083
Thank you.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.291
-Yo!
-You again?

36:38.375 --> 36:40.083
-Yeah. Hi.
-Got a new name to run?

36:40.166 --> 36:41.958
No. Same name, bit of a twist.

36:42.041 --> 36:45.875
See, somebody went through a lot of effort
to purge Max's name from the system,

36:45.958 --> 36:48.750
but what are the odds
they spelled it correct in every report,

36:48.833 --> 36:50.666
every memo to file, every station cable?

36:50.750 --> 36:52.250
-Non-existent.
-Exactly.

36:52.333 --> 36:56.333
Chances are, they only erased the records
with her name spelled the right way.

36:56.416 --> 37:00.041
So I have comprised a list
of 100 misspellings for you to run.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.625
Add any in that you think
I might have missed.

37:03.125 --> 37:05.916
-This is actually really smart.
-Thank you.

37:10.666 --> 37:13.375
-Amelia? Hi.

37:13.458 --> 37:16.291
-I don't think we've officially met.
-Owen.

37:16.375 --> 37:17.708
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.416
Shut the door.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.708
Violet said you might be stopping by.

37:21.791 --> 37:23.750
Yes. I could use a little advice.

37:23.833 --> 37:27.291
But warning, I have to overshare a little.
Is that okay?

37:27.375 --> 37:30.375
Sure. Before you do,
we should lay out ground rules.

37:30.458 --> 37:31.958
-Okay.
-I need romance.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.291
Not a lot, I don't have time
for anything serious,

37:34.375 --> 37:36.916
but you'll have to put in
some effort if we start dating.

37:38.041 --> 37:40.250
Violet told you I was interested?

37:40.750 --> 37:43.458
Yeah. You don't think
I'd help you for nothing.

37:43.541 --> 37:45.083
No, no, no. Of course not.

37:45.166 --> 37:48.291
I'm just-- I'm still learning
how things work here.

37:48.375 --> 37:50.208
Trust me, it's so much easier this way.

37:50.291 --> 37:52.083
I dated a guy who worked in Big Pharma,

37:52.166 --> 37:55.000
and the weekly contact reports
I had to write were a fucking nightmare.

37:57.000 --> 37:57.875
Wow...

37:59.208 --> 38:01.416
Well, I'm a big fan of romance.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.708
It's important to make sure
that there's a spark.

38:03.791 --> 38:05.750
Real intimacy requires
a mental connection.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.125
Okay. Don't get all touchy-feely.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.666
I'm just looking for dinner and a movie
once in a while.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.666
So we'll go out one night this week,
you pick a nice place.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.708
Not somewhere to be seen.
I don't do trendy.

38:14.791 --> 38:17.541
And the food's gotta be good.
I'm an eater.

38:18.333 --> 38:19.166
Got it.

38:20.833 --> 38:21.750
To business?

38:23.125 --> 38:24.125
What do you need?

38:24.625 --> 38:26.875
-Is this about your squeaky wheel?
-Yeah.

38:26.958 --> 38:30.333
She's a former asset
in prison for murder in Arizona.

38:30.416 --> 38:33.416
I need her case to go federal
so I can drop the charges if need be.

38:33.500 --> 38:36.208
Okay, I'll call A'Nyah Bell
at Main Justice.

38:36.291 --> 38:37.958
But I won't tell her that last part.

38:38.041 --> 38:41.458
Just that we need to get this case
elevated for national security reasons.

38:41.541 --> 38:44.375
We can actually have
the Justice Department take over a case?

38:44.458 --> 38:49.416
No, but I can totally make A'Nyah think
that bigfooting it is a good career move.

38:49.500 --> 38:53.500
-What's your asset's name?
-It's Maxine Meladze.

38:53.583 --> 38:56.416
M-E-L-A-D-Z-E.

38:56.916 --> 38:58.958
She's at Perryville right now.

38:59.666 --> 39:01.708
-Got it.
-Thanks.

39:03.458 --> 39:04.750
You're a good kisser, right?

39:04.833 --> 39:08.000
You're not one of those who comes in
open-mouth and piledriver tongue?

39:08.083 --> 39:09.916
God, no. No, I hate that.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.625
I dated a girl in high school,
felt like she was trying to eat my face.

39:13.708 --> 39:14.958
I'm more subtle.

39:17.958 --> 39:19.291
Looking forward to it.

39:21.458 --> 39:22.291
Yeah.

39:26.083 --> 39:28.208
-Hey. How'd it go with Amelia?

39:28.791 --> 39:32.333
Magical. Already planning the wedding.
You wanna be the best man?

39:32.416 --> 39:35.333
-Is she gonna help you with your thing?
-Yes.

39:35.416 --> 39:39.125
Good. Good.
I'm glad we could provide the hookup.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.458
Thank you for the connect.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.666
-This better not be another empty file.
-Not completely.

39:48.750 --> 39:51.916
-But I got fewer results than I thought.
-This is it?

39:52.000 --> 39:55.500
Someone went to the trouble
of classifying misspellings too.

39:55.583 --> 39:58.000
They just missed one. Cyrillic's a bitch.

39:58.541 --> 40:01.041
Yeah, man, this is heavily redacted.

40:01.125 --> 40:03.291
-How do I get the original?
-Above my pay grade.

40:03.375 --> 40:06.458
There is a case officer mentioned
that isn't redacted, at the bottom.

40:06.958 --> 40:07.833
Thank you.

40:15.708 --> 40:18.208
Sir, I need to go to Vienna.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.750
No, you don't. Use the telephone.

40:25.875 --> 40:29.208
Sir, this is a conversation
you don't wanna risk getting intercepted.

40:40.750 --> 40:43.458
I can give you more specifics,
but then you'd be in the loop

40:43.541 --> 40:46.041
on some things that you might
want deniability on later.

40:46.625 --> 40:50.583
Are you playing me? Do you have an agenda
I need to worry about?

40:50.666 --> 40:54.875
No. Sir, I'm just trying to do the job
that you hired me for.

40:57.208 --> 40:59.541
Okay. Tell me a little more.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.583
There's a case officer in Vienna
who might be the key to understanding

41:03.666 --> 41:06.000
just how dangerous my squeaky wheel is.

41:09.625 --> 41:11.000
Okay. Go.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.083
But be careful.

41:12.833 --> 41:15.083
Vienna is the espionage Olympics,

41:15.166 --> 41:19.083
where every foreign intelligence agency
sends their all-stars.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.750
So don't get cute.

41:20.833 --> 41:24.208
-Do your business and get out. Understand?
-Yes, sir.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.791
-It's like a plane crash. Yeah.
-His island?

41:40.541 --> 41:44.500
-What the hell are you doing?
-I am looking for my black passport.

41:44.583 --> 41:47.875
According to Operations, it was
delivered in my office five days ago.

41:47.958 --> 41:50.666
That was before I left to Yemen.

41:51.875 --> 41:53.916
-Well, I don't have it. No.
-No?

42:03.833 --> 42:04.791
Oh...

42:06.958 --> 42:08.041
What's this?

42:10.166 --> 42:12.333
Must've gotten mixed up in my mail.

42:12.416 --> 42:14.750
Yeah, I'm sure Nyland's gonna buy that.

42:16.958 --> 42:19.041
All right. What do you want?

42:19.625 --> 42:22.500
Well, Nyland is sending me to Vienna,

42:22.583 --> 42:25.250
and I need to set up
a nominal cover identity.

42:26.833 --> 42:28.333
You're gonna tell me how.

42:37.333 --> 42:40.333
<i>A nominal cover identity</i>
<i>will not hold up to any scrutiny.</i>

42:40.416 --> 42:43.458
<i>So don't put yourself in a situation</i>
<i>where you have to rely on it.</i>

42:43.541 --> 42:45.333
<i>You'll be going to Vienna as a diplomat.</i>

42:45.416 --> 42:49.416
<i>Specifically, a temporary legal attaché</i>
<i>for the State Department.</i>

42:49.500 --> 42:50.875
<i>The station will check you in,</i>

42:50.958 --> 42:53.208
<i>so you don't need</i>
<i>to interact with the front desk.</i>

42:53.291 --> 42:56.041
<i>Just walk into the lobby,</i>
<i>and someone will hand you your key.</i>

42:59.291 --> 43:00.125
Hi.

43:00.750 --> 43:01.708
Lance Miller?

43:03.583 --> 43:06.958
Um... No. Lance Millerman.

43:10.000 --> 43:10.833
Thank you.

44:05.083 --> 44:06.750
Are you waiting for someone?

44:07.958 --> 44:09.750
-Yeah.
-What's your name?

44:11.000 --> 44:12.875
It's Lance Millerman.

44:13.708 --> 44:15.458
There's a phone call for you.

44:16.833 --> 44:17.833
<i>Danke.</i>

44:19.625 --> 44:20.458
Hello?

44:20.541 --> 44:23.791
Congratulations. You're being followed
by the entire United Nations.

44:24.500 --> 44:27.083
<i>I've been watching you</i>
<i>the whole way over from the hotel.</i>

44:27.166 --> 44:29.125
<i>Did anyone teach you countersurveillance?</i>

44:29.208 --> 44:32.000
Why would they? I'm a legal attaché
from the State Department.

44:32.083 --> 44:34.708
No, you're a toddler
playing dress up in a shark tank.

44:34.791 --> 44:37.125
<i>Go to the embassy. I'll meet you there.</i>

44:37.208 --> 44:39.208
<i>I'm not blowing my cover</i>
<i>for this shit show.</i>

44:47.083 --> 44:49.458
Sorry about that.
It's my first time in Vienna.

44:49.958 --> 44:52.500
Wait until we get into a SCIF.

44:58.750 --> 44:59.583
Thank you.

45:06.750 --> 45:08.291
What the hell are you doing here?

45:09.000 --> 45:11.208
Relax, I'm just here for some information.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.750
So it's not a thing.

45:13.666 --> 45:16.208
You got the General Counsel
to ask for country clearance,

45:16.291 --> 45:18.166
the U.S. ambassador to sign off on it,

45:18.250 --> 45:21.333
and flew all the way to Vienna
to tell me this isn't a thing?

45:21.416 --> 45:24.250
You're right. It is a thing.
And you're a bit fucked.

45:24.333 --> 45:26.875
But the question is how fucked, you know?

45:27.375 --> 45:29.125
So just sit your ass down.

45:32.625 --> 45:34.041
Okay. No problem.

45:39.833 --> 45:41.333
What do you need to know?

45:41.416 --> 45:44.583
Well, you were stationed
in Belarus in 2014.

45:45.333 --> 45:46.875
I was only there on TDY.

45:47.583 --> 45:48.416
What is that?

45:49.208 --> 45:52.791
Temporary duty.
A few months between formal assignments.

45:53.958 --> 45:55.583
What was the station like?

45:57.458 --> 46:01.291
Honestly, it was a shit show.
No supervision, infighting out the ass.

46:01.375 --> 46:03.458
I couldn't wait to get out of there.

46:06.208 --> 46:08.125
Ever heard the name Max Meladze?

46:11.041 --> 46:12.291
Once or twice.

46:12.375 --> 46:15.083
Well, I'm trying to
find the hall file on her.

46:15.166 --> 46:16.000
Why?

46:17.208 --> 46:18.541
Not at liberty to say.

46:20.083 --> 46:20.916
Look.

46:21.791 --> 46:25.041
Russia, Belarus, they're mafia states.

46:26.083 --> 46:29.250
The mob provides the muscle
for whatever the political elites ask for,

46:29.333 --> 46:33.166
and keeping those elites happy
was Max's specialty.

46:33.250 --> 46:36.166
Which is why she was such
a valuable asset for us.

46:37.416 --> 46:38.625
Who was her handler?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.375
She was between handlers when I arrived.

46:43.833 --> 46:47.125
Is that normal?
For an asset to be without a handler?

46:47.708 --> 46:50.541
No. But her first dropped dead
of a heart attack.

46:51.416 --> 46:54.333
I complained to Langley,
they asked me to fix it,

46:54.416 --> 46:56.791
but there was no way
I was getting stuck in that mud.

46:58.541 --> 47:02.958
And then Belarus became a denied area
right when I was moving on.

47:04.750 --> 47:08.250
Sorry, what does that mean,
"a denied area"?

47:10.166 --> 47:14.916
An extremely hostile, operational
environment with heavy surveillance.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.083
It's basically too hot to run operations,
so you bug out until things calm down.

47:19.791 --> 47:22.916
-And what happens to your assets?
-It depends.

47:25.166 --> 47:27.125
What happened with Max Meladze?

47:28.541 --> 47:31.208
No idea. I was long gone by then.

47:33.500 --> 47:35.958
Look, man, you can tell me the truth,

47:36.666 --> 47:39.166
or I can have your ass called back to D.C.

47:39.250 --> 47:41.250
so you have to answer
to the General Counsel.

47:44.625 --> 47:48.375
I heard she was empowered
to run her own network.

47:48.958 --> 47:50.500
Of agency assets?

47:51.125 --> 47:53.375
-Mm-hm.
-That's insane.

47:53.458 --> 47:56.875
She didn't even have a hard file.
There's no POA, no 201.

47:56.958 --> 48:00.000
-There's nothing.
-I don't know anything about that.

48:00.083 --> 48:04.583
So an unvetted asset was just allowed
to handle other assets?

48:09.541 --> 48:12.041
That means she knows
the identities of most, if not all,

48:12.125 --> 48:14.750
of our spies in Belarus and Russia.

48:16.166 --> 48:18.000
Told you you didn't wanna know.

48:19.333 --> 48:20.958
Jesus Christ.

48:23.208 --> 48:24.041
Are we done?

48:26.958 --> 48:27.916
No.

48:30.833 --> 48:31.666
Sit down.

48:38.416 --> 48:40.125
Why did Max leave Belarus?

48:43.541 --> 48:47.208
She pissed off the wrong person
in the mob. He was trying to kill her.

48:47.875 --> 48:49.208
Well, who got her out?

48:50.916 --> 48:53.791
No idea. I was long gone by then.

48:56.166 --> 48:57.333
Is that SOP?

48:58.333 --> 49:00.166
To just abandon assets?

49:02.541 --> 49:05.625
A hundred percent.
Once she was dead to the Russians,

49:05.708 --> 49:08.875
she stopped being an asset,
so she was dead to us.

49:11.041 --> 49:12.958
She's making threats, isn't she?

49:16.208 --> 49:17.875
Does that idea make you nervous?

49:18.708 --> 49:23.041
No. I told you,
I only met her once.

49:24.916 --> 49:27.791
No, no. You said that
you'd heard her name.

49:28.291 --> 49:30.208
Once or twice.

49:31.375 --> 49:33.916
So now you're telling me that you met her.

49:34.666 --> 49:36.958
Well, I mean, in passing.

49:40.250 --> 49:42.666
All right. This is what I need from you.

49:43.375 --> 49:45.541
I need you to go into your files

49:45.625 --> 49:49.000
and give me everything
that you have on Max Meladze.

49:49.500 --> 49:52.000
Sure, no problem. I'll get right on it.

50:03.250 --> 50:04.083
Okay.

50:18.166 --> 50:20.375
-Where are you?
-<i> I am in Vienna.</i>

50:20.458 --> 50:22.791
And I know what
you're threatening to expose too.

50:22.875 --> 50:24.916
That means you talked to somebody.
Tell me the name.

50:25.916 --> 50:29.833
Nope. That's the one thing you don't have.
Real names. That's my leverage.

50:29.916 --> 50:32.916
Congratulations.
You're officially part of the game.

50:33.500 --> 50:35.875
And I am one step closer to going home.

50:35.958 --> 50:37.041
<i>Oh, yeah? Me too.</i>

50:37.125 --> 50:38.500
Hey, airport.

50:43.875 --> 50:46.416
If you won't tell me the name,
at least tell me how it went.

50:48.333 --> 50:49.833
We got a lot of pushback.

50:49.916 --> 50:53.291
This person definitely
has some secrets to hide.

50:53.375 --> 50:55.791
<i>Okay, you're gonna have to tell me</i>
<i>who you met with.</i>

50:56.416 --> 50:57.333
Why?

50:57.416 --> 51:01.166
Because the secrets I know
are worth killing to keep quiet.

51:08.916 --> 51:10.000
That's weird.

51:10.083 --> 51:10.916
What?

51:11.000 --> 51:13.291
Hey, is Gunther your dad?

51:13.791 --> 51:15.083
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

51:15.708 --> 51:16.833
<i>This isn't her cab.</i>

51:18.666 --> 51:20.875
Owen, she's an assassin.

51:20.958 --> 51:22.666
<i>You have to kill the driver.</i>

51:25.583 --> 51:27.541
I can't-- I can't do that.

51:27.625 --> 51:29.791
-Kill her, or she kills you.
<i>-No.</i>

51:29.875 --> 51:31.750
<i>-Are you in the back seat?</i>
-Yes.

51:31.833 --> 51:34.916
<i>Okay. Take the seatbelt</i>
<i>and strangle her from behind,</i>

51:35.000 --> 51:38.958
or you can find a pen, stick it in her ear
and scramble her brain.

51:39.041 --> 51:40.958
-I can't. I can't do that.
<i>-Owen!</i>

51:41.458 --> 51:43.958
Hi, excuse me.
Would you mind pulling over?

51:44.041 --> 51:46.583
-I need to get out.
<i>-Stop talking. Kill her!</i>

51:46.666 --> 51:47.708
I can't kill her!

51:48.500 --> 51:50.125
-Shit.

52:17.875 --> 52:20.125
-Oh, fuck!

52:20.208 --> 52:21.041
Shit.

52:22.625 --> 52:24.208
<i>Okay, I'm out of the car.</i>

52:24.291 --> 52:26.500
<i>-You ever been to Vienna?</i>
-Many times.

52:26.583 --> 52:28.500
<i>Great. I need some fucking help</i>
<i>getting away.</i>

52:28.583 --> 52:30.000
Tell me, where are you?

52:30.083 --> 52:33.958
There's buildings,
and I think I'm by the opera house.

52:34.041 --> 52:35.291
<i>-Oh, shit.</i>
-Okay.

52:41.708 --> 52:44.250
-She's after me again.
<i>-She wouldn't be if you'd killed her.</i>

52:44.333 --> 52:46.750
You need to steal a car.
She'll catch you if you stay on foot.

52:46.833 --> 52:48.750
-What?
<i>-Do it! Owen, now!</i>

52:53.875 --> 52:55.958
Shit. Oh, my God.

52:58.625 --> 52:59.708
Hey!

53:05.708 --> 53:07.791
-Sorry!

53:07.875 --> 53:10.375
Don't apologize. Why are you apologizing?

53:14.291 --> 53:16.583
Because carjacking
is a new experience for me.

53:22.708 --> 53:24.916
Owen, fill me in.
What the fuck is going on?

53:35.708 --> 53:38.083
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

53:38.708 --> 53:41.083
Owen? What's happening? Who's yelling?

53:42.666 --> 53:44.541
I don't want to talk about it.

53:44.625 --> 53:45.875
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

53:46.500 --> 53:47.333
I'm sorry.

53:47.416 --> 53:50.166
-I'm sorry. I know.

53:58.250 --> 54:00.250
-Shit.

54:01.375 --> 54:03.208
Oh, shit. Okay.

54:03.291 --> 54:06.208
Uh, I'm on a bridge.
I don't know which one.

54:06.291 --> 54:08.125
<i>-There's buildings.</i>
-Okay, that's not helpful.

54:08.208 --> 54:10.625
Oh, shit. There's another assassin.

54:12.083 --> 54:13.791
They're both in taxis.

54:14.541 --> 54:17.166
Okay, I'm stuck on a bridge. What do I do?

54:18.208 --> 54:20.416
-Can you swim?
-It's 20 degrees outside.

54:20.500 --> 54:23.125
<i>That's T-shirt weather in Belarus.</i>
<i>Get in the river. Do it!</i>

54:23.208 --> 54:25.208
It's your only option.
Get in the fucking river!

54:25.291 --> 54:27.208
What do you need, a "three, two, one"?

54:31.833 --> 54:32.750
Fuck!

54:42.791 --> 54:43.791
Fuck!
