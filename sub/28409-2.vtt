01:23.360 --> 01:25.040
You all right?

01:26.040 --> 01:28.039
Are you all right?

01:28.040 --> 01:30.040
I'm a bit nervous.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.440
Good job it's not you giving
evidence today, then. I know.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.040
Look...

01:41.280 --> 01:42.880
I'm sorry.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.040
Just...

01:47.040 --> 01:49.040
tell the truth.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.759
Simple as that?

01:51.760 --> 01:54.280
She's the one that's on trial here.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.920
You can do this.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.760
I've got no choice, have I?

04:10.520 --> 04:12.360
Was that the door?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.240
Are you ready to go?

04:19.040 --> 04:20.759
I'm not so sure.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.519
You can't hide away forever.
I'm not hiding.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.359
Good. Neither am I.
You've done nothing wrong.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.760
I know.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.039
But why antagonise people? How is
a pub lunch antagonising anyone?

04:32.040 --> 04:34.040
I'm saying... maybe...

04:35.040 --> 04:37.759
maybe if we keep our heads
down a bit longer,

04:37.760 --> 04:39.679
give it a chance to blow over.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.679
I don't want Jess upset.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.760
She'll be more upset if we
don't go. You promised her.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.800
What if someone says something?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.280
I was thinking...

04:55.280 --> 04:58.519
maybe we should tell her.
Scare her to death? She's six.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.280
For her safety, Craig.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.040
It's not fair. No, I know.
It's not fair on anyone.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.040
But you know I'm right.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.040
I'm always right, aren't I?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.359
We're family.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.279
We deal with things together

05:21.280 --> 05:24.359
and six is old enough to know
the truth is always best.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.679
Yeah?

05:25.680 --> 05:27.039
Yeah?

05:27.040 --> 05:28.600
Give me a kiss.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.040
All right?

05:42.040 --> 05:44.280
What happened to your head, mate?

05:58.040 --> 06:02.040
But why are people saying you did
a nasty thing if it isn't true?

06:03.040 --> 06:06.439
Well, that's what happens when
someone starts a rumour, isn't it?

06:06.440 --> 06:08.199
It sort of just spreads.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.040
There's nothing to worry about,
sweetheart. I'm...

06:14.760 --> 06:17.519
You just have to tell us
if someone says anything to you

06:17.520 --> 06:19.360
or makes you feel worried, OK?

06:23.640 --> 06:26.520
It's the bandage.
They're looking at the bandage.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.639
Millie and Lauren aren't allowed
to come to my birthday.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.279
But they're your best friends,
aren't they?

06:33.280 --> 06:35.640
They say you're a baddie.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.319
I need your help, Mo.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.519
The police are saying it's not him.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.040
I need proof that Craig Myers
is Eddie J Turner.

07:20.280 --> 07:24.759
And there was me thinking you
wanted to meet to apologise.

07:24.760 --> 07:28.039
Look, I wanted to tell you,
but you'd have been incriminated.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.080
You don't think I'm incriminated?

07:33.760 --> 07:36.679
I never signed up for this, Anna.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.560
Not violence.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.600
Did you have him attacked?

07:44.600 --> 07:46.040
No.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.279
But you know who did it?

07:49.280 --> 07:50.960
No.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.239
DI Grover?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.319
Is she ready for me?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.760
Erm, she is me and, yes, I am.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.839
Anna Dean's phone records.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.279
Gosh, you're keen. Well, since we're
not being given enough time to build

08:25.280 --> 08:28.359
the best possible case against her,
I thought I'd do what I could

08:28.360 --> 08:30.760
to speed things along.
Great. Come on up.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.039
So, what's he like, Craig Myers?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.039
He's quiet. Shy.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.759
A bit awkward with people.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.759
Not the ideal witness, then.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.159
Do you think he's Eddie J Turner?

08:44.520 --> 08:47.600
I think he's quiet, shy,
a bit awkward with people.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.519
How would you react to being
accused of killing a child?

08:51.520 --> 08:53.679
From what I gather,
only a few officials

08:53.680 --> 08:56.839
in the Justice and Social Work
Department plus the Chief Constable

08:56.840 --> 08:59.839
would know where Turner is now.
This isn't about Eddie J Turner.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.439
It's about someone trying to
kill someone else.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.039
Right, but obviously I need to
familiarise myself

09:05.040 --> 09:07.999
with the original case.
Because you'd have been what, 12?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.919
14, actually,
but the point stands,

09:10.920 --> 09:13.760
and I found something
that might be of interest.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.759
What if I told you that a year
after the verdict,

09:19.760 --> 09:24.759
a court admin officer was asked, and
I use the term advisedly, to leave

09:24.760 --> 09:28.119
after Turner's name
was leaked on the internet.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.679
Now, at the time, they said it was
an admin error, but apparently

09:31.680 --> 09:34.519
it was very deliberate and common
knowledge on the circuit

09:34.520 --> 09:37.079
who the culprit was.
So why no prosecution?

09:37.080 --> 09:39.759
Insufficiency,
so I can't use it in court,

09:39.760 --> 09:42.719
but I did want to see
these phone records

09:42.720 --> 09:45.520
just in case the same name
and number crops up.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.560
Yeah, there it is.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.040
Called several times
on the day of the attack.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.840
And what's the name?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.200
Maureen Buckley.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.280
She's a private investigator.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.519
Miss Buckley, could you tell
the court

10:13.520 --> 10:17.040
exactly what being a private
investigator involves?

10:18.040 --> 10:20.279
Well, I'm no Miss Marple.

10:20.280 --> 10:24.359
Erm, I mostly provide a tracing
service for solicitors,

10:24.360 --> 10:27.519
insurance companies,
credit and loan organisations.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.760
The odd bit of matrimonial
is about as glamorous as it gets.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.359
You help third parties find people.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.520
That's what I meant to say, yes.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.800
Do you know Anna Dean? Yes.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.440
I wrote to her...

10:44.440 --> 10:46.279
after Liam's death

10:46.280 --> 10:49.519
to say that my heart went out
to her and, you know,

10:49.520 --> 10:51.959
if there's ever anything I can do.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.320
If there's ever anything I can do?

10:56.040 --> 10:58.840
Nobody should have to
bury their child.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.239
'I've been given over 100 names
over the years.'

11:03.240 --> 11:05.839
How many of those have I
passed on to you?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.759
One. One.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.760
Craig Myers is Eddie J Turner.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.040
And now I'm going to prove it
to everyone in court.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.279
You do have proof?

11:20.280 --> 11:24.600
I was in the process of getting it
when you decided to go global.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.959
I know what I'm asking, Mo,

11:30.960 --> 11:32.839
but this is my chance.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.839
For what? What will you do
with proof when you get it?

11:36.840 --> 11:39.279
Confront him with it in open court.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.679
Then he won't be able to
hide any more.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.119
He'll have to face up to
what he did.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.679
Please,

11:45.680 --> 11:49.039
you need to tell me
where you got his name.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.359
Mo.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.359
An ex-prison officer from
a Young Offenders', OK?

11:53.360 --> 11:56.599
He was trying to sell
a story on Turner

11:56.600 --> 11:59.039
and the interdict scared him off.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.279
He gave me Craig Myers and I
cross-referenced his details

12:02.280 --> 12:04.079
with Turner's birth date.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.519
Our Craig Myers uses the same
digits in a different order

12:07.520 --> 12:10.040
with a year taken off his age.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.199
And this guy has proof?

12:15.200 --> 12:18.279
I only spoke to him on the phone.
I didn't get a chance to meet him.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.439
Let's meet him now, then. I don't
think you know what you're asking.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.280
The police will get to me.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.519
Expecting me to lie to Lenny
and Lou is one thing,

12:27.520 --> 12:31.520
but do you know what the maximum
sentence is for perjury?

12:32.760 --> 12:35.760
Can the witness be shown Crown
Production Number 36, please?

12:38.280 --> 12:41.759
It is a matter of agreement that
this is Anna Dean's phone record

12:41.760 --> 12:43.679
from October last year.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.280
Do you see your number on there,
Miss Buckley?

12:48.040 --> 12:49.479
Yes.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.359
How many times did you and Mrs Dean
speak to each other

12:52.360 --> 12:55.279
between the 24th and the 31st
of October last year,

12:55.280 --> 12:57.520
the day Craig Myers was attacked?

12:59.080 --> 13:01.919
You want me to add them up?
Can you look at the record

13:01.920 --> 13:04.759
and confirm that there
are 24 separate calls

13:04.760 --> 13:06.439
over seven days,

13:06.440 --> 13:10.760
including eight on the 30th
and... nine on the 31st?

13:11.760 --> 13:15.560
I'm not the best at maths
but 24 sounds right.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.559
Do you remember what you talked
about on any of those occasions?

13:19.560 --> 13:21.439
It could have been anything.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.759
A wine offer in a supermarket, which
member of the Scottish rugby team

13:24.760 --> 13:26.519
we'd like to be in the bath with.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.439
You were discussing what should be
done with the information

13:29.440 --> 13:32.039
you had accessed for Mrs Dean,
were you not? Objection.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.839
I'm sure you're aware that's
a leading question, Ms Mackie.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.600
I'm sorry, My Lady.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.920
Miss Buckley...

13:42.040 --> 13:45.039
has Anna Dean ever asked you
to track down

13:45.040 --> 13:47.560
the new identity of Eddie J Turner?

14:01.520 --> 14:03.199
No.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.519
She hasn't and she wouldn't.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.520
She's too good a friend.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.039
The attack on Craig Myers?

15:27.040 --> 15:30.039
Yeah, still no forensics.
The knife was clean.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.319
But we're talking to people
close to the Grahams

15:32.320 --> 15:33.999
and trawling through
supporter lists.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.959
OK. I wasn't looking for
an update, actually.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.799
I need you on the Inverkip murder.
Why?

15:39.800 --> 15:42.919
Because you're a senior detective
and someone's been killed.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.439
Yeah, but I'm in the middle of

15:44.440 --> 15:46.719
building a case...
Against Anna Dean. Yes.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.079
She did more than put
a message online.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.799
There's no evidence for that.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.640
I just told you, I'm finding it!

15:54.440 --> 15:57.439
DS Harvey is across everything.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.359
I need you to move on.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.639
There's a theme emerging here?

16:01.640 --> 16:03.639
Craig Myers' advocate is a teenager,

16:03.640 --> 16:05.999
and you're passing
an attempted murder to... Whoa.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.239
DS Harvey is an extremely capable
detective. I don't doubt DS Harvey.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.119
Meaning? That I wonder if everyone
cares about the victim

16:13.120 --> 16:14.839
in this case as much as they might,

16:14.840 --> 16:18.000
considering the continued
speculation about his identity.

16:20.720 --> 16:25.239
I agreed to take you on
because it suited both of us.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.279
Don't make me regret that,
Steven.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.880
Or revoke it.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.040
All right?

16:52.040 --> 16:54.240
When did you last see your ex-wife?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.360
It's years, for definite, but...

17:00.320 --> 17:03.000
these places do strange things
to time.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.119
You made numerous threats towards
Eddie J Turner through the media.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.119
I've been looking at some of
your previous cellmates.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.358
Plenty with form for violence.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.839
I'm sure there's lots would do you
this particular favour.

17:18.839 --> 17:21.479
Why aren't we at the station?
We'll talk to them all, Christian.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.638
Why are you on your own?

17:23.640 --> 17:25.599
You're out next month.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.999
If you've got anything to tell me,
do it now.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.999
Let me help you.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.520
You're not supposed to be here,
are you?

17:38.920 --> 17:41.839
Have I thought about killing
Eddie J Turner?

17:41.840 --> 17:43.520
Yes.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.480
But I've thought about
killing myself even more.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.320
I let Liam down.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.639
I wasn't there
when he needed me most

17:55.640 --> 17:58.319
and nothing will ever
take that away.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.719
So threaten me all you like -
bring back the rack

18:01.720 --> 18:04.320
and put my head on a spike
on Waverley Bridge, because...

18:05.560 --> 18:07.560
the worst thing
that could ever happen to me?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.640
Already has.

18:16.200 --> 18:20.039
As your manager, I want you to know
you've got my full support.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.959
Thank you. But.

18:21.960 --> 18:25.439
Serious head injuries and driving
60-odd people around town

18:25.440 --> 18:27.319
don't sit so well together,
you know?

18:27.320 --> 18:29.439
The doctor signed me off, Leigh -
I can drive.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.399
Then there's the PR question.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.639
If anything did happen, God forbid,
we might be covered legally,

18:36.640 --> 18:40.279
but it wouldn't be the doctors
getting called negligent.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.640
You see?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.239
So...

18:50.240 --> 18:52.519
what we're saying is,

18:52.520 --> 18:54.039
come back!

18:54.040 --> 18:58.400
But take your time?
Let things, you know...

18:59.600 --> 19:00.920
heal.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.640
I've never let you down, Leigh,
have I?

19:30.760 --> 19:32.160
I need to drive.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.319
OK!

19:57.320 --> 19:58.839
Arms up.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.360
That's it.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.240
Bye-bye. Bye! Bye!

20:14.320 --> 20:16.079
Hiya. Are you OK?

20:16.080 --> 20:17.599
Yeah, fine.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.999
How did it go?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.480
Somebody put my number online.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.800
My e-mail, too.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.840
Do you think it was someone we know?

20:28.200 --> 20:30.599
Don't look at it.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.320
Don't look at any of it.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.919
OK, date of birth?

20:41.920 --> 20:44.120
31st July, 1994.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.120
Are you all right?

20:54.680 --> 20:57.839
The T shirt! Right!

20:57.840 --> 21:00.519
It looks great. Do they all fit?

21:00.520 --> 21:02.199
Thank you.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.560
It was my daughter's boyfriend
sent them. I just passed them on.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.840
Right.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.839
So what are we doing again?

21:16.840 --> 21:18.680
Blood and urine.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.720
Blood and urine.

21:24.360 --> 21:28.000
Although, you could just tell me
if you've been using...

21:29.920 --> 21:32.119
But then you'd have to trust me.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.760
I do trust you.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.200
Why?

21:39.600 --> 21:42.320
You're right. Let's do the tests.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.999
Fired to
such a high temperature...

22:15.000 --> 22:16.359
Hiya.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.279
The glass powder melts,
becomes liquid,

22:19.280 --> 22:21.679
fuses and hardens again.

22:21.680 --> 22:26.719
Usually you'll find it in beautiful
sky-blue, turquoise colours.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.919
The thing that makes me nervous...

22:28.920 --> 22:30.600
OK, Daniel?

22:31.760 --> 22:34.840
Aye, not bad, Len, thanks.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.960
He had to give a statement
about the night of the attack.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.960
We all know it was you, son.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.279
If it was me,
he wouldn't be taking Anna to court.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.160
He wouldn't be going anywhere.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.959
Is she not back yet?

23:12.960 --> 23:15.159
No, and you'd best
get in front of your homework,

23:15.160 --> 23:17.480
or we'll both be for it
when she does get home. Go on.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.880
Do you hear me?

23:25.120 --> 23:27.440
Do you really think
she'll even care?

23:29.280 --> 23:31.879
What's the subject, Benny boy?

23:31.880 --> 23:33.599
Maths.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.599
Should me and you go and smash it,
then play some FIFA?

23:36.600 --> 23:38.960
Come on.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.679
He's great with Ben. Aye.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.600
Shite at maths, though.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.120
Did you know Liam?

24:04.760 --> 24:05.839
No.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.879
I was at the same school,
but I was older, so...

24:08.880 --> 24:11.120
I only knew him by sight.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.400
You know your mum's amazing,
don't you?

24:20.480 --> 24:22.199
I mean...

24:22.200 --> 24:23.920
really amazing.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.519
I thought they would have
given up by now.

24:46.520 --> 24:49.199
He tried to keep them from me
but there's too many...

24:49.200 --> 24:50.759
No! No, no, no, no!

24:50.760 --> 24:53.160
Some of those have been wiped
with dog shit!

24:56.040 --> 24:57.799
I'll have them looked at.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.919
We're still getting taxis
and takeaways sent at all hours.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.679
They're saying
he's a paedophile now. I know.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.079
So, was Liam Graham sexually abused,
or...?

25:06.080 --> 25:07.439
Not as far as anyone's aware,

25:07.440 --> 25:11.039
but it's pointless trying to apply
logic to these things.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.879
You said someone would
keep an eye on the house.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.760
No-one's contacted you?

25:17.840 --> 25:19.880
I'm sorry. Leave that with me.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.119
It feels like everything's
just stopped.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.679
And the worst thing is,
whoever did it is still out there.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.239
He could be anyone.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.759
Anyone!

25:28.760 --> 25:31.119
We can look at moving you all.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.280
This is our home.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.119
Listen, in my experience,
people who might actually kill you

25:46.120 --> 25:48.000
don't tell you about it first.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.600
You're not on your own.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.480
Save us cooking.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.519
Why don't we fight fire with fire?

26:17.520 --> 26:21.759
We can put proof online that you
are who we say you are, like, er,

26:21.760 --> 26:26.519
birth certificate, school reports,
even swimming badges. Anything!

26:26.520 --> 26:31.319
Why the hell should we? Because
someone decided to accuse me?

26:31.320 --> 26:35.439
Nobody has the right to even
make us think about doing that.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.799
Or moving house! Yeah, I agree
with you - of course I do -

26:39.800 --> 26:42.519
but it's obviously not stopping,
Craig,

26:42.520 --> 26:44.599
and you don't seem to understand,

26:44.600 --> 26:47.479
it's not going to,
not unless we do something.

26:47.480 --> 26:52.679
Look, you are going to have to
stand up in court

26:52.680 --> 26:56.879
and face a room full of people
that think you're a child killer.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.559
Do you know what people are saying?

26:59.560 --> 27:01.799
They're saying,
"If it's not Myers, why doesn't he"

27:01.800 --> 27:04.120
"join the campaign to find
the real Eddie J Turner?"

27:05.640 --> 27:08.960
What people? Maybe that's the only
way. Maybe WE have to find him.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.399
OK.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.999
And what if we did?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.519
Are you serious? What then, Bex?

27:20.520 --> 27:23.519
Put his face online
to get US off the hook?

27:23.520 --> 27:26.280
Yeah!
Yeah, at least he'd deserve it.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.040
Do you actually believe that?

27:31.880 --> 27:33.240
Don't you?

27:55.200 --> 27:58.079
Why isn't anyone looking
after the Myers'?

27:58.080 --> 28:00.639
They're being persecuted
in their own home.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.079
I'll send a special constable.
That's not good enough.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.519
They need to know that
this is being taken seriously.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.999
It is. Is it? You haven't even
interviewed Anna Dean's ex-husband.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.599
Christian Graham's in prison. So?

28:11.600 --> 28:16.839
So... he's a former high street
accountant, not El Chapo.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.799
Doesn't mean he didn't help
organise the attack.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.159
I can't ask Tait
if I can bring in a suspect

28:22.160 --> 28:24.760
that was locked up
at the time of the offence.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.559
So what exactly ARE you doing?

28:32.560 --> 28:35.519
Or have you just been told to
let this one slide?

28:35.520 --> 28:37.559
The only thing
I've been told not to do

28:37.560 --> 28:40.599
is to talk to you
about the investigation.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.840
But I'm trying to use
my discretion here.

28:43.920 --> 28:47.479
Look, we all understand
why you might feel an affinity

28:47.480 --> 28:51.199
with Craig Myers,
but there's no conspiracy.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.640
Just remember who the victim is.

29:41.040 --> 29:46.159
Myers arrived on our wing from a
secure unit to finish his sentence.

29:46.160 --> 29:51.279
He's quiet, no bother.
But there is something about him.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.599
None of the staff
like the smell of him.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.839
One day his cell bell goes. We
get in there and find an Asian lad

29:57.840 --> 29:59.599
with bad head injuries.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.039
Turns out he's gone into
Myers' cell to do someone,

30:02.040 --> 30:04.399
been disarmed
and attacked with his own weapon.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.399
I say, well, that serves
you right, then, son.

30:07.400 --> 30:12.239
He says, "But, boss,
Eddie J Turner is in there."

30:12.240 --> 30:16.399
Now, if that's true, I need to get
him off the wing, fast.

30:16.400 --> 30:20.519
So I go to the number one governor,
and I report what I've been told.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.559
And he says,

30:21.560 --> 30:26.719
forget it, put nothing
down on paper, never happened.

30:26.720 --> 30:30.599
The Asian lad gets shipped out
straight away, and that's it.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.799
Then one day,
that cell's suddenly empty,

30:32.800 --> 30:37.360
and all we're told is to box up the
props in there and drop it to OMU.

30:38.520 --> 30:42.639
So, I do as I'm told,
but now I'm curious.

30:42.640 --> 30:46.199
And I get on their system to see
where these boxes are going.

30:46.200 --> 30:49.159
Inverclyde Criminal
Justice Services.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.479
But there's no contact name,
nothing.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.519
I can't even find Myers' record now.

30:54.520 --> 31:01.279
So, I phone them, and they won't say
whether either lad is their client!

31:01.280 --> 31:03.079
That is unheard of!

31:03.080 --> 31:06.239
Hang on. Either lad?

31:06.240 --> 31:08.039
There was two of them in that cell?

31:08.040 --> 31:10.799
Myers shared the cell with
a lad from another secure unit.

31:10.800 --> 31:11.840
You never...

31:13.160 --> 31:15.039
So what's this other lad's name?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.079
He was nobody.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.199
But it's possible that it was him
they were protecting, not Myers,

31:19.200 --> 31:22.560
and therefore that Craig Myers
isn't Eddie J Turner!

31:33.080 --> 31:35.679
I'm sorry. If I'd known, I'd have
waited to give you the name.

31:35.680 --> 31:39.799
Why? He's sure and so am I -

31:39.800 --> 31:42.959
Craig Myers is Eddie J Turner.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.759
And when he stands up in court

31:44.760 --> 31:48.040
and falls to pieces in front
of everyone, he'll prove it himself.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.040
All I'm saying is you
should talk to her.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.680
I know what you're saying, but...

32:21.400 --> 32:23.279
Hey, Bex.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.199
Talk to who about what? What's that?

32:26.200 --> 32:27.559
Tom said you should talk to her.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.600
Talk to who?

32:31.520 --> 32:33.599
Our lawyer, Ms Mackie.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.279
He doesn't think it's a good idea,
me giving evidence in court.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.919
Doesn't he?

32:38.920 --> 32:40.839
Look, I know it's none of
my business... Do you?

32:40.840 --> 32:42.999
But they'll rip him
to shreds, won't they?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.599
Will they? Why? Why?!

32:45.600 --> 32:47.239
Cos I've known him ten years,

32:47.240 --> 32:50.439
and he can only just hold
a conversation with me!

32:50.440 --> 32:53.319
You know what these
lawyers are like, all right?

32:53.320 --> 32:55.360
The way they can twist things.

32:58.800 --> 32:59.839
I think,

32:59.840 --> 33:02.759
when we're deciding what
paint to use to decorate

33:02.760 --> 33:05.479
the hallway,
then maybe we should ask Tom.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.159
But for legal questions that will
affect the future of our family,

33:08.160 --> 33:10.040
I think we should
trust our advocate.

33:35.160 --> 33:36.359
Witness statements are

33:36.360 --> 33:38.879
usually taken by a
precognition officer,

33:38.880 --> 33:42.200
but given that we haven't got long,
I want to be across everything.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.399
Do I have to be a witness?

33:46.400 --> 33:49.679
You'll be required to give evidence
on behalf of the Crown, yes.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.999
You mean, I've got no choice?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.040
Not really.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.440
What about her?

33:59.160 --> 34:02.599
The accused isn't required to give
evidence, but I'll be surprised

34:02.600 --> 34:04.999
if the defence don't call her.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.120
Now, do you have any
specific concerns?

34:08.639 --> 34:11.239
I'm not mad about talking,
that's all.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.080
I'm no good at it.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.120
Even... this.

34:20.480 --> 34:24.599
We're already making an
application for special measures.

34:24.600 --> 34:28.799
You can have a supporter if you want,
or screens, if that might help.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.840
No.

34:31.440 --> 34:37.918
No. If I have to do it, I don't want
her thinking I'm hiding away.

34:37.920 --> 34:38.960
OK.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.600
So, I see you have a
previous conviction.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.279
What's that got to do with this?

34:47.280 --> 34:51.199
Well, the defence can bring out
anything that calls your character

34:51.199 --> 34:54.599
into question and makes
your word seem unreliable to a jury.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.599
But can they ask her about her past?

34:57.600 --> 35:03.360
Yes, in theory but, as she hasn't
got any previous convictions, no.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.439
Craig...

35:07.440 --> 35:11.519
if what you're concerned about
is people close to you hearing

35:11.520 --> 35:16.199
certain information for the first
time, you might consider...

35:16.200 --> 35:17.240
pre-empting that.

35:26.920 --> 35:27.960
You're next.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.480
You look even younger
than in your picture.

35:41.960 --> 35:47.359
It's the glasses. They're for court
only - it's shameful, I know, but...

35:47.360 --> 35:50.679
everything's a performance
in the end, isn't it?

35:50.680 --> 35:54.319
So I've got here that you were
upstairs, getting Jessica

35:54.320 --> 35:56.559
ready for bed,
you heard the doorbell and Craig...

35:56.560 --> 35:58.640
Sorry, can I ask you something?

35:59.800 --> 36:03.639
You must have had witnesses who've
had to change their identity.

36:03.640 --> 36:04.679
Have you?

36:04.680 --> 36:08.959
We're not really supposed to talk about anything
other than this case, Mrs Myers. I'm sorry.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.119
Yeah, I know, it's just...

36:11.120 --> 36:12.479
I was looking online,

36:12.480 --> 36:16.919
and it says that they are trained
in counter-surveillance,

36:16.920 --> 36:20.239
told to stay off social media,
avoid drink and drugs.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.679
I'm really not the person
you should be talking to.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.199
I mean, they have to get
clearance to go on holiday,

36:25.200 --> 36:27.999
let alone get married
and have kids. Is...

36:28.000 --> 36:29.879
Is that right? Mrs Myers...

36:29.880 --> 36:34.000
I've got no-one I can talk to,
not about this, not now.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.560
I understand you're
having questions, but...

36:40.880 --> 36:43.759
the internet isn't always the best
place to get the most reliable...

36:43.760 --> 36:45.399
I know that.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.440
You know that.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.760
Sorry.

36:52.080 --> 36:55.079
I don't know anything
about Eddie J Turner.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.399
No, no, no,
I'm not asking that, I'm just...

36:57.400 --> 37:04.240
I am asking if someone in that position
would be allowed to have kids.

37:07.640 --> 37:11.679
All I know is that there
would be risk assessment,

37:11.680 --> 37:15.239
careful monitoring,
particularly at the outset,

37:15.240 --> 37:17.119
but I'm really not supposed to...

37:17.120 --> 37:19.839
Even without
the rest of the family knowing?

37:19.840 --> 37:23.599
Well, I mean, that would be
a question for those in charge

37:23.600 --> 37:25.279
of the case and the subject.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.959
But, yes, if all else is going well,

37:28.960 --> 37:31.999
there's no reason why
life can't be totally normal.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.679
Just to be clear, Mrs Myers, the Crown's
position is that it doesn't matter

37:37.680 --> 37:39.640
whether Craig is
Eddie J Turner or not.

37:41.680 --> 37:42.720
It matters to me.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.199
Let's see something later.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.240
Go on, go and play.

37:52.840 --> 37:53.880
Be good!

38:09.400 --> 38:11.960
Bex, I need to tell you something.

38:14.080 --> 38:18.480
About five years back, I was walking
through the town with Tom...

38:21.200 --> 38:23.640
and some guy out with
his mates said something.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.200
Next thing,
we ended up in a bit of a scuffle.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.440
Is that it?

38:35.240 --> 38:37.799
Why didn't you say anything?

38:37.800 --> 38:42.439
There was nothing much to say, I was
admonished, there was no actual punishment.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.439
What, like, you were convicted?
Like, you went to court?

38:45.440 --> 38:46.960
It was something and nothing.

38:51.640 --> 38:54.239
How many days were you in court for?

38:54.240 --> 38:55.280
Only one.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.399
Where did you tell me you were?

38:58.400 --> 38:59.959
Work, I suppose.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.119
Right.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.279
So you didn't just not tell me,
did you? You lied.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.320
You were out of it, remember?

39:08.840 --> 39:10.119
You had enough to worry about.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.800
Yeah, I've got enough to worry about
now, Craig! So why are you telling me?

39:22.680 --> 39:24.999
Cos it's going to come out in court.
That's why, isn't it?

39:25.000 --> 39:26.120
Bex... Isn't it?

39:30.480 --> 39:31.520
I'm sorry.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.639
You really don't make it easy,
do you?

39:34.640 --> 39:35.680
What do you mean?

39:40.480 --> 39:41.680
What else, Craig?

39:43.200 --> 39:45.520
What else does Tom
know about you that I don't?

39:47.440 --> 39:49.040
You know me better than anyone.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.560
How come Social Services visited
for so long after Jess was born?

39:58.120 --> 39:59.160
You know why.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.480
Cos you were struggling...

40:04.200 --> 40:08.160
and we had no family support.
I couldn't cope on my own.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.320
I'm not him, Bex, he's not me.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.640
You ready, soldier?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.160
I've only waited 15 years for this.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.159
Solomon can't actually ask him.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.119
You know that, don't you?

41:02.120 --> 41:08.640
Not outright, but he knows I know,
and he'll break, I know he will.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.000
Thanks for that.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.519
How's the next witness feeling?

41:22.520 --> 41:24.120
You two aren't allowed to talk.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.679
Your accomplice - sorry, friend -

41:28.680 --> 41:31.199
seems to be having trouble
remembering who's on trial.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.280
No smoke without fire,
though, is there?

41:35.360 --> 41:38.159
If you're referring to
the allegations about me,

41:38.160 --> 41:40.399
I'd have thought
you as a PI would understand

41:40.400 --> 41:43.479
the importance of evidence,
how certain you need to be

41:43.480 --> 41:47.359
before making accusations that
can destroy someone's life.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.839
Innocent until proven guilty,

41:49.840 --> 41:53.160
the same human rights your
friend is benefitting from.

41:54.120 --> 41:58.080
I suppose we're used to thinking only child
killers are entitled to human rights?

42:01.840 --> 42:05.199
You know, the only reason you get
away with saying such stupid things

42:05.200 --> 42:08.919
is because people feel sorry for you,
or they need you to sell newspapers.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.639
Somebody really
needs to tell you that.

42:10.640 --> 42:11.680
Have you got kids?

42:13.360 --> 42:15.640
No. Craig Myers has.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.479
You've no more expertise or
rights than anyone else,

42:20.480 --> 42:24.519
and the idea that you should have any say
in what happens to Liam's killer is absurd.

42:24.520 --> 42:25.679
He's her son.

42:25.680 --> 42:29.960
I know, and the only thing that
entitles her to is her grief.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.400
Mr Myers?

43:20.560 --> 43:23.999
Mr Myers, oath or affirmation?

43:24.000 --> 43:25.359
Oath, please.

43:25.360 --> 43:27.999
I swear by Almighty God that
I shall tell the truth,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.120
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.080
Advocate Depute.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.480
Could you tell us your name and age?

43:47.920 --> 43:49.960
My name is Craig Andrew Myers.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.720
I'm 28 years old.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.240
Are you working at the moment?

44:51.200 --> 44:52.480
What's the wrong with me?

46:10.960 --> 46:13.400
Hello? I couldn't do it.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.119
You couldn't do what?

46:16.120 --> 46:18.600
Couldn't drive the bus,
let alone pick anyone up.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.679
What happened?

46:24.680 --> 46:29.399
I offered to work in the depot, but Leigh
just wanted me to take more time off.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.839
You're a driver,
he says, and if you can't drive...

46:32.840 --> 46:35.039
Nobody wants me around.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.919
Did he say that?

46:36.920 --> 46:39.680
He didn't have to! He was just
looking for an excuse.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.239
What do you mean?

46:43.240 --> 46:45.640
I told him, back me or sack me.

46:47.280 --> 46:49.080
And they sacked you?

46:54.840 --> 46:55.880
Craig?

46:59.960 --> 47:01.000
Sorry.

47:02.440 --> 47:03.479
Yes.

47:03.480 --> 47:05.839
They sacked you from a job you
had held for eight years with

47:05.840 --> 47:08.119
an unblemished record -
is that correct?

47:08.120 --> 47:09.559
Yes. Craig...

47:09.560 --> 47:13.719
before we talk about the specific
events of the 31st October, 2017,

47:13.720 --> 47:17.720
can you tell us how else your life has
been impacted by what happened that night?

47:21.680 --> 47:25.359
Before, I was just, you know...

47:25.360 --> 47:27.239
ordinary.

47:27.240 --> 47:30.439
Enjoying my work
and time with my family.

47:30.440 --> 47:33.519
That's pretty much all
I've ever wanted.

47:33.520 --> 47:37.919
But everything that I've done since
it happened, everything I've said,

47:37.920 --> 47:39.879
it's like people are reading
things into things

47:39.880 --> 47:42.200
all of the time, trying to
figure out if I'm...

47:44.720 --> 47:49.399
I feel like everyone's staring
at me, I feel like everyone knows.

47:49.400 --> 47:50.720
Knows what, Craig?

47:51.640 --> 47:52.800
That I'm the one.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.600
Accused of being him...

47:57.680 --> 47:58.880
Eddie J Turner.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.279
Most people think there's no smoke
without fire, don't they?

48:04.280 --> 48:05.440
I've thought it myself.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.719
And the thing is, there's nothing
you can do once it's been said.

48:09.720 --> 48:10.760
It's there forever.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.760
Some people will always think that you're
him, no matter what you say or do.

48:20.560 --> 48:23.480
And you'll probably always think
you're being stared at.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.600
Hiya.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.160
Come on.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.200
Don't worry. I can get a job.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.600
Is that you?

49:18.800 --> 49:21.520
Jess has got to do this family tree
for school.

49:22.880 --> 49:24.240
I thought you'd seen them.

49:27.720 --> 49:29.240
You look like Jess in that one.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.680
We haven't got a single
photo of you as a child.

49:42.280 --> 49:45.039
I don't think anybody wanted
to remember my childhood!

49:45.040 --> 49:48.080
There's things we should have
talked about, Craig... Get off!

49:52.000 --> 49:53.040
Mr Myers...

49:54.520 --> 49:56.879
when DI Grover asked
you in the hospital

49:56.880 --> 50:00.120
if the attacker had said anything
to you, what was your reply?

50:04.320 --> 50:06.239
I said no.

50:06.240 --> 50:07.759
Because?

50:07.760 --> 50:09.999
Because I didn't remember.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.839
"No."

50:11.840 --> 50:13.240
And what made you remember?

50:14.800 --> 50:16.279
I don't...

50:16.280 --> 50:18.359
I mean,
how do you remember anything?

50:18.360 --> 50:20.119
That's the question.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.959
Well, I can't answer it, sorry.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.479
I just did!

50:23.480 --> 50:25.119
Very well.

50:25.120 --> 50:29.839
We've heard evidence going to the
severity of the head injury sustained.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.559
First, I'd like to make clear to
the jury that the wounds visible

50:33.560 --> 50:37.799
today are not as a result
of the Halloween attack.

50:37.800 --> 50:41.000
Those are more recent
injuries, are they not?

50:42.800 --> 50:44.399
Yes.

50:44.400 --> 50:49.039
Now, given the seriousness of that
original head injury and Dr Nielsen's

50:49.040 --> 50:53.159
lack of certainty about
how your memory might be affected,

50:53.160 --> 50:56.559
if we accept that the
attacker did speak,

50:56.560 --> 51:00.959
how sure can you realistically
be of his exact words?

51:00.960 --> 51:02.159
It's what he said.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.239
But they were whispered,
were they not?

51:04.240 --> 51:05.639
Yes.

51:05.640 --> 51:07.679
After the blows? Yes.

51:07.680 --> 51:12.079
Savage blows, and yet YOU can
be absolutely positive?

51:12.080 --> 51:13.919
I just told you, it's what he said.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.799
The problem is, we only
have your word for that, don't we?

51:16.800 --> 51:17.839
I don't...

51:17.840 --> 51:20.080
Why is it a problem?
Are you calling me a liar?!

51:25.520 --> 51:26.839
Are you a liar, Mr Myers?

51:26.840 --> 51:27.999
No.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.239
You've never lied to the authorities before?
I'd remind you that you're under oath.

51:32.240 --> 51:34.879
If you're speaking about 2012,
I was admonished.

51:34.880 --> 51:39.519
For a street brawl in which you
denied any involvement to the police,

51:39.520 --> 51:42.799
until CCTV evidence
caught you in a lie.

51:42.800 --> 51:44.839
Is that correct?
It was a stupid idea.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.000
Is that correct?

51:47.680 --> 51:48.720
Yes.

52:36.760 --> 52:37.800
Rebecca!

52:41.120 --> 52:42.160
Are you OK?

52:54.560 --> 52:56.439
I've no doubt that you've
been the victim...

52:56.440 --> 52:57.840
of violence, Mr Myers.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.120
But I do doubt your memory.

53:16.200 --> 53:17.240
Mr Myers?

53:19.280 --> 53:22.439
You see, I believe that
you are misremembering,

53:22.440 --> 53:26.119
deliberately or otherwise,
trying to make sense of a random

53:26.120 --> 53:29.040
event by creating connections
where there are none.

53:31.080 --> 53:32.999
Do you think that's possible?

53:33.000 --> 53:37.559
No. I'm not lying and there's
nothing wrong with my memory.

53:37.560 --> 53:38.799
Really?

53:38.800 --> 53:43.559
So, if asked, you could tell the court what
you were doing last week, or last month?

53:43.560 --> 53:45.919
I think so, as much as anybody else.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.799
What about six months,
or a year ago?

53:48.800 --> 53:49.839
I suppose.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.160
What if I asked you...

53:54.000 --> 53:56.240
about your childhood, Mr Myers?

54:11.040 --> 54:13.119
I don't see what that's
got to do with anything.

54:13.120 --> 54:17.519
My Lady... I tend to agree with
the witness, Mr Mishra.

54:17.520 --> 54:21.039
The reliability of the complainer's memory
goes to the heart of this case, My Lady.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.599
My Lady, may I remind the court
that we are not here to establish

54:23.600 --> 54:25.639
whether Craig Myers
is Eddie J Turner?

54:25.640 --> 54:26.679
That's not what I asked.

54:26.680 --> 54:30.079
I don't like talking about my childhood,
and I don't see why I should have to.

54:30.080 --> 54:32.959
Understood, Mr Myers.

54:32.960 --> 54:36.039
Confirmation that you have
childhood memories should

54:36.040 --> 54:38.840
prove sufficient for
Mr Mishra's purposes.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.120
The truth is, I don't.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
But it's not because
I have a bad memory.

55:02.040 --> 55:06.359
My mum and dad were always out,
so...

55:06.360 --> 55:11.599
I'd go and stay with people, or
get put in care for a week or two.

55:11.600 --> 55:14.040
But most of the time,
I was on my own.

55:17.320 --> 55:18.480
So what's to remember?

55:20.320 --> 55:21.479
Ask him who he is.

55:21.480 --> 55:23.239
You seem agitated, Mr Myers.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.079
You'd be agitated! Ask him.

55:25.080 --> 55:28.879
The witness' memory appears sound,
Mr Mishra, please move on.

55:28.880 --> 55:30.879
No! Mrs Dean, please...

55:30.880 --> 55:33.119
Ask him while he's under oath.
Ask him!

55:33.120 --> 55:34.480
You ask me!

56:02.320 --> 56:03.360
Sorry.

56:30.200 --> 56:32.399
I know you were hoping for more.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.000
He thinks he's got away with it.

56:38.040 --> 56:40.960
I'm not giving up, Mo. I can't.

56:53.840 --> 56:56.079
You have to stay out of prison.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.999
And that means winning the sympathy
of the judge and the jury,

56:59.000 --> 57:03.120
