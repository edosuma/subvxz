<i>The story that I want to tell
you cannot be found in a book.</i>

01:50.319 --> 01:54.697
<i>They say the history of the west was
written from the saddle of a horse,</i>

01:54.698 --> 01:57.867
<i>but it's never been told
from the heart of one...</i>

01:57.868 --> 01:59.766
<i>Not till now.</i>

02:01.330 --> 02:03.039
<i>I was born here</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:06.667
<i>in this place that would come
to be called the old west</i>

02:06.668 --> 02:09.612
<i>but to my kind,
the land was ageless.</i>

02:09.713 --> 02:12.006
<i>It had no beginning and no end,</i>

02:12.007 --> 02:15.111
<i>no boundary between earth and sky.</i>

02:16.053 --> 02:18.596
<i>Like the wind in the buffalo grass</i>

02:18.597 --> 02:20.665
<i>we belonged here.</i>

02:20.724 --> 02:23.077
<i>We would always belong here.</i>

02:25.520 --> 02:28.648
<i>They say the mustang is
the spirit of the west.</i>

02:28.649 --> 02:31.275
<i>Whether that west was
won or lost in the end</i>

02:31.276 --> 02:33.970
<i>you'll have to decide for yourself</i>

02:34.404 --> 02:37.448
<i>but the story I want
to tell you is true.</i>

02:37.449 --> 02:41.019
<i>I was there, and I remember.</i>

02:41.745 --> 02:45.498
<i>I remember the sun and the sky
and the wind calling my name</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:48.398
<i>in a time when wild
horses ran free.</i>

04:36.568 --> 04:38.887
<i>Here I am</i>

04:39.279 --> 04:41.302
<i>This is me</i>

04:41.865 --> 04:46.687
<i>I come into this world
So wild and free</i>

04:47.746 --> 04:49.473
<i>Here I am</i>

04:50.081 --> 04:52.958
<i>So young and strong</i>

04:52.959 --> 04:57.235
<i>Right here in the place
Where I belong</i>

04:58.256 --> 05:00.883
<i>It's a new world</i>

05:00.884 --> 05:03.578
<i>It's a new start</i>

05:03.720 --> 05:09.141
<i>It's alive with the beating
Of a young heart</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:11.836
<i>It's a new day</i>

05:11.895 --> 05:14.396
<i>In a new land</i>

05:14.397 --> 05:17.046
<i>And it's waiting for me</i>

05:19.194 --> 05:21.342
<i>Here I am</i>

05:24.449 --> 05:28.202
<i>Oh, it's a new world</i>

05:28.203 --> 05:30.351
<i>It's a new start</i>

05:31.164 --> 05:36.293
<i>It's alive with the beating
Of a young heart</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:39.296
<i>Yeah, it's a new day</i>

05:39.297 --> 05:41.048
<i>In a new land</i>

05:42.175 --> 05:45.199
<i>And it's waiting for me</i>

05:46.513 --> 05:48.866
<i>Here I am</i>

07:32.744 --> 07:35.371
<i>And so I grew from colt to stallion</i>

07:35.372 --> 07:38.749
<i>as wild and reckless as
thunder over the land</i>

07:38.750 --> 07:42.127
<i>racing with the eagle,
soaring with the wind.</i>

07:42.128 --> 07:43.504
<i>Flying?</i>

07:43.505 --> 07:46.529
<i>There were times
I believed I could.</i>

08:16.997 --> 08:21.083
<i>Like my father before me I became
leader of the Cimarron herd</i>

08:21.084 --> 08:24.086
<i>and with that honor
came responsibility.</i>

09:29.778 --> 09:36.602
<i>I hear the wind
Across the plain</i>

09:37.243 --> 09:44.147
<i>A sound so strong
That calls my name</i>

09:44.542 --> 09:48.003
<i>It's wild like the river</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:51.654
<i>It's warm like the sun</i>

09:51.758 --> 09:53.592
<i>Yeah, it's here</i>

09:53.593 --> 09:57.869
<i>This is where I belong</i>

09:59.808 --> 10:03.128
<i>Under the starry skies</i>

10:03.186 --> 10:07.189
<i>Where eagles have flown</i>

10:07.190 --> 10:10.359
<i>This place is paradise</i>

10:10.360 --> 10:14.196
<i>It's the place I call home</i>

10:14.197 --> 10:17.991
<i>The moon on the mountains</i>

10:17.992 --> 10:21.392
<i>The whisper through the trees</i>

10:21.704 --> 10:24.331
<i>The waves on the water</i>

10:24.332 --> 10:28.502
<i>Let nothing come
Between this and me</i>

10:28.503 --> 10:32.047
<i>'Cause everything I want</i>

10:32.048 --> 10:36.153
<i>Is everything that's here</i>

10:36.386 --> 10:40.036
<i>And when we're all together</i>

10:40.265 --> 10:45.227
<i>There's nothing to fear</i>

10:46.354 --> 10:49.173
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

10:50.984 --> 10:53.485
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

10:53.486 --> 10:55.863
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh...</i>

11:02.245 --> 11:06.165
<i>And wherever I wander</i>

11:06.166 --> 11:09.987
<i>The one thing I've learned</i>

11:10.920 --> 11:12.693
<i>Yeah</i>

11:13.256 --> 11:17.111
<i>It's to here I will always</i>

11:17.802 --> 11:21.532
<i>Always...</i>

11:23.183 --> 11:25.411
<i>Return...</i>

12:06.476 --> 12:09.455
<i>Something new came upon
the land one night,</i>

12:09.562 --> 12:12.522
<i>something that would
change my life forever,</i>

12:12.523 --> 12:16.298
<i>and so, my journey began.</i>

13:13.209 --> 13:16.670
<i>A wiser horse might
have turned and run</i>

13:16.671 --> 13:19.741
<i>but I wanted to know what
strange creatures were here.</i>

13:50.079 --> 13:51.663
Oh!

13:51.664 --> 13:52.981
What the...

13:54.083 --> 13:55.810
- Son of a...
- Shh...

13:56.419 --> 13:57.896
Look.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.548
Man, look at that stallion!

14:01.549 --> 14:02.650
It's beautiful!

14:22.320 --> 14:24.718
Mmm, Sadie Mae.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.718
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

14:32.538 --> 14:34.122
Get him, boys!

14:34.123 --> 14:35.499
Easy, boy!

14:37.752 --> 14:39.669
C'mon, boys! Let's go!

14:39.670 --> 14:41.238
C'mon, boys!

14:52.975 --> 14:54.201
Hyah! Hyah!

14:59.190 --> 15:01.108
Where did he go? I don't see him.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.802
We'll find him!

15:11.869 --> 15:13.141
What the...

15:47.363 --> 15:48.697
Faster!

16:03.880 --> 16:05.277
What?

16:07.508 --> 16:08.905
Get him!

16:09.218 --> 16:10.911
Come on!

16:11.053 --> 16:12.154
Get him!

16:16.976 --> 16:18.419
Hyah! Yah! Yah!

16:19.395 --> 16:21.247
Come on, come on, come on!

16:28.988 --> 16:31.762
- Ha-ha! We got him now!
- You betcha!

16:34.410 --> 16:36.262
Whoa!

16:39.540 --> 16:40.916
Look out!

16:40.917 --> 16:42.314
Whoa!

17:04.357 --> 17:06.800
Thought you got away,
didn't you, mustang?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.154
Over here!

17:11.155 --> 17:12.614
Get back here! You crazy?

17:12.615 --> 17:13.740
Get back from him!

17:13.741 --> 17:15.282
Take him! Take him, Joe!

17:15.284 --> 17:16.761
Get the horse!

17:18.954 --> 17:20.579
He's ours now.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.045
Hold him!

17:27.046 --> 17:28.568
Watch him!

17:29.215 --> 17:31.132
Watch the lines! Watch the lines!

17:31.133 --> 17:32.300
Come on!

17:32.301 --> 17:34.261
He can do all the
kicking he wants now.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.330
It won't do no good.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.603
Careful... Careful...

18:07.378 --> 18:11.506
<i>I was scared, and I didn't know
what was going to happen to me</i>

18:11.507 --> 18:14.360
<i>but at least my mother
and the herd were safe.</i>

18:18.055 --> 18:19.389
- Come on!
- Let's go!

18:20.766 --> 18:21.850
Yo... Come on...

18:23.227 --> 18:26.187
<i>Gotta fight another fight</i>

18:26.188 --> 18:29.107
<i>I gotta run another night</i>

18:29.108 --> 18:32.193
<i>Get it out, check it out</i>

18:32.194 --> 18:35.196
<i>I'm on my way
And it don't feel right</i>

18:35.197 --> 18:37.741
<i>I gotta get me back</i>

18:37.742 --> 18:40.812
<i>I can't be beat
And that's a fact</i>

18:41.037 --> 18:43.538
<i>It's okay, I'll find a way</i>

18:43.539 --> 18:47.083
<i>Ain't gonna take me down
No way</i>

18:47.084 --> 18:48.668
<i>No</i>

18:48.669 --> 18:52.714
<i>Yeah, don't judge a thing
Till you know what's inside it</i>

18:52.715 --> 18:55.675
<i>Don't push me
I'll fight it</i>

18:55.676 --> 18:59.846
<i>Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no</i>

18:59.847 --> 19:01.431
<i>No</i>

19:01.432 --> 19:05.185
<i>If you can't catch a wave
Then you're never gonna ride it</i>

19:05.186 --> 19:07.896
<i>You can't come uninvited</i>

19:07.897 --> 19:11.672
<i>Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no</i>

19:13.861 --> 19:18.448
<i>You can't take me, I'm free</i>

19:29.251 --> 19:32.003
<i>Why did it all go wrong?</i>

19:32.004 --> 19:35.090
<i>I want to know
What's going on</i>

19:35.091 --> 19:38.259
<i>What's this holding me?</i>

19:38.260 --> 19:40.579
<i>I'm not where
I'm supposed to be</i>

19:41.055 --> 19:43.890
<i>I gotta fight another fight</i>

19:43.891 --> 19:46.870
<i>I gotta fight with all my might</i>

19:46.977 --> 19:50.146
<i>I'm getting out, so check it out</i>

19:50.147 --> 19:53.608
<i>You're in my way, yeah
You better watch out...</i>

19:53.609 --> 19:55.151
Open the gate!

19:55.152 --> 19:59.114
<i>Come on! Don't judge a thing
Till you know what's inside it</i>

19:59.115 --> 20:01.991
<i>Don't push me, I'll fight it</i>

20:01.992 --> 20:05.286
<i>Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no</i>

20:05.287 --> 20:07.789
<i>No</i>

20:07.790 --> 20:10.959
<i>If you can't catch a wave
Then you're never gonna ride it</i>

20:10.960 --> 20:13.545
<i>You can't come uninvited</i>

20:13.546 --> 20:18.341
<i>Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no</i>

20:20.010 --> 20:25.583
<i>You can't take me, I'm free</i>

20:28.185 --> 20:29.753
I'm free

20:42.491 --> 20:44.576
What seems to be the
problem, gentlemen?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.411
We got us a crazy one here, sir.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.620
Pure mustang, Colonel.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.098
Really?

20:52.710 --> 20:55.529
The army has dealt with
wild horses before.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.611
This one will be no different.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.676
Come on, mustang.

21:01.677 --> 21:05.998
<i>I remember the first time I saw
a rattler curled up in my path.</i>

21:07.391 --> 21:09.559
- Induct this animal, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir!

21:09.560 --> 21:11.352
<i>This one didn't look like a rattler</i>

21:11.353 --> 21:14.397
<i>but I was still thinking, snake.</i>

21:14.398 --> 21:15.523
Take up that slack.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.626
Grab him! Grab him!

21:19.695 --> 21:20.820
Come on, horse!

21:20.821 --> 21:23.174
Okay, Murphy, he's all yours.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.575
He's a wild one.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.685
We'll see how wild he is
when I'm done with him.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.061
See that?

21:37.379 --> 21:39.339
You want to fight, do you?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.100
Right.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.899
Make sure that's good and tight.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.426
- Murphy, look out!
- Watch out!

22:27.471 --> 22:29.471
He's a wild one.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.298
You all right, Murph?

22:47.449 --> 22:48.700
You...

23:03.549 --> 23:05.447
Murph, you okay?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.638
Corporal, round up some volunteers

23:10.639 --> 23:13.308
to take this animal to the stables.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.127
Not the stables.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.394
Sir?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.917
The corral.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.420
It's time to break that horse.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.654
<i>Well, you think
That you can take me on</i>

23:26.655 --> 23:29.115
<i>You must be crazy...</i>

23:29.116 --> 23:31.184
Make sure it's good and tight.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.454
<i>There ain't a single
thing you've done</i>

23:34.455 --> 23:37.229
<i>That's gonna faze me</i>

23:39.460 --> 23:43.235
<i>Oh, but if you want
To have a go</i>

23:43.881 --> 23:47.110
<i>I just want to let you know</i>

23:48.010 --> 23:52.555
<i>Yeah, get off of my back
And into my game</i>

23:52.556 --> 23:56.225
<i>Get out of my way
'Cause I'm wild and untamed</i>

23:56.226 --> 24:00.957
<i>Get out of my face
Or give it your best shot</i>

24:01.231 --> 24:04.192
<i>I think it's time
You better face the fact</i>

24:04.193 --> 24:06.152
<i>Get off of my back...</i>

24:06.153 --> 24:08.927
Okay, my turn!

24:13.994 --> 24:17.246
<i>You know
It's all just a game</i>

24:17.247 --> 24:20.100
<i>That I'm playin'</i>

24:21.919 --> 24:23.544
<i>Don't think that you
can find a way in...</i>

24:23.545 --> 24:25.004
Lousy heap of horse flesh!

24:25.005 --> 24:26.547
<i>That's what I'm sayin'...</i>

24:27.883 --> 24:29.485
Come on! Run out of there!

24:29.718 --> 24:33.118
<i>Now, if you want to have a go</i>

24:33.555 --> 24:36.849
<i>I just want to let you know</i>

24:38.519 --> 24:40.728
<i>Get off of my back</i>

24:40.729 --> 24:42.772
<i>And into my game</i>

24:42.773 --> 24:46.651
<i>Get out of my face
'Cause I'm wild and untamed</i>

24:46.652 --> 24:50.488
<i>Get out of my way or give
it your best shot...</i>

24:50.489 --> 24:51.739
We got a rider!

24:51.740 --> 24:54.575
<i>But you know this train
Is comin' off this track</i>

24:54.576 --> 24:56.577
<i>Get off of my back</i>

24:57.746 --> 25:00.474
<i>Yeah, get off of my back</i>

25:01.542 --> 25:03.042
<i>Get off</i>

25:03.043 --> 25:06.713
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...</i>

25:06.714 --> 25:11.426
<i>Get off, get off, get off, get off</i>

25:11.427 --> 25:13.803
<i>Get off, get off, get off</i>

25:13.804 --> 25:16.373
<i>Get off of my back</i>

25:21.812 --> 25:23.604
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.753
Tie this horse to the post.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.714
No food or water.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.795
- Three days.
- Yes, sir.

26:25.876 --> 26:29.105
<i>My heart galloped through
the skies that night,</i>

26:29.505 --> 26:33.030
<i>back to my herd, where I belonged</i>

26:34.176 --> 26:38.531
<i>and I wondered if they missed
me as much as I missed them.</i>

27:06.041 --> 27:07.792
Get some water over to the stable.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.440
Yes, sir.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.169
We caught a hostile!

27:40.117 --> 27:42.185
Bring him back this way!

27:47.666 --> 27:49.609
What do we have here?

27:50.419 --> 27:52.712
We caught him by the
supply wagons, sir.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.072
Ah, a Lakota.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.260
Not as tall as the Cheyenne,

27:59.261 --> 28:01.554
not as fine-featured as the Crow.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.931
Take him away, gentlemen.
Show him our best.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.933
Corporal, take him
to the stockades.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.878
Not the stockades... The post.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.730
No food or water.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.046
Come on!

28:20.073 --> 28:21.925
What are you looking at, boy?

28:23.452 --> 28:27.056
<i>He was called Little Creek and he
seemed different from the rest.</i>

28:42.721 --> 28:44.494
Hey...

29:22.344 --> 29:26.995
<i>There was just no end to the
strange ways of the two-leggeds.</i>

29:41.822 --> 29:44.175
C Company! Ten-hut!

29:44.950 --> 29:46.784
With the Colonel's permission, Sir.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.995
Incoming patrol reports
hostiles headed north.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.079
Ah.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.665
The rail road has
expressed concern, sir.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.042
They've requested
additional patrols.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.795
- How long has it been, sergeant?
- Sir?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.990
The mustang, how long
has it been tied?

30:00.882 --> 30:02.883
Three days, sir.

30:02.884 --> 30:06.204
Good. Fetch my crop and spurs.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.346
You can break easy or you
can break hard, mustang!

30:28.618 --> 30:30.619
No! Back up! Back up! Back up!

30:35.375 --> 30:36.459
Come on!

30:39.463 --> 30:40.815
Come on!

30:42.966 --> 30:44.818
Come on... Come on...

30:45.552 --> 30:47.199
Come on, mustang!

30:53.352 --> 30:54.704
Ha!

31:28.136 --> 31:31.740
You see, gentlemen, any
horse can be broken.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.711
Move along, mustang.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.524
There are those in Washington

31:41.525 --> 31:44.253
who believe the west
will never be settled,

31:45.070 --> 31:48.489
the Northern Pacific Railroad
will never breach Nebraska,

31:52.327 --> 31:54.179
a hostile Lakota

31:54.996 --> 31:57.565
will never submit to providence...

31:59.459 --> 32:02.670
And it is that manner
of small thinking

32:02.671 --> 32:05.900
that would say this horse
could never be broken.

32:06.508 --> 32:09.987
Discipline, time and patience,

32:11.054 --> 32:13.498
are the three great levelers.

32:18.311 --> 32:21.290
<i>Sometimes a horse has gotta
do what a horse has gotta do.</i>

32:21.398 --> 32:22.481
Mustang?

32:22.482 --> 32:24.630
<i>And this was one of those times.</i>

32:45.881 --> 32:46.982
Oh, no!

32:52.762 --> 32:54.614
You all right, sir?

33:01.730 --> 33:03.503
Get off me!

33:28.590 --> 33:31.534
Soldier, secure that horse!

34:37.993 --> 34:40.619
<i>I wasn't sure what
happened back there</i>

34:40.620 --> 34:43.205
<i>and I wasn't about to stop and ask.</i>

34:43.206 --> 34:46.400
<i>All I knew was that
I was headed home.</i>

35:10.900 --> 35:12.568
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

35:12.569 --> 35:17.015
<i>One moment I was free,
and the next, more ropes.</i>

35:49.898 --> 35:51.966
Steady. Steady.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.590
I'm not going to hurt you.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.640
Nice and easy.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.686
There you go.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.693
That feels better now, doesn't it?

37:27.370 --> 37:28.787
Hey, hey!

37:50.059 --> 37:51.752
<i>I couldn't understand it.</i>

37:52.020 --> 37:55.856
<i>She treated this scrawny
two-legged like one of our kind</i>

37:55.857 --> 37:58.650
<i>prancing around him like
a love-struck yearling.</i>

37:59.778 --> 38:01.300
<i>It was downright unnatural.</i>

38:09.370 --> 38:13.441
Great mustang, today
I will ride you.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.195
This ought to be good.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.256
Mares!

38:49.828 --> 38:54.354
Okay, Rain, let's see if you can
teach this mustang some manners.

40:09.991 --> 40:13.493
<i>Okay, I admit it, she was charming</i>

40:13.494 --> 40:15.938
<i>in a stubborn,
irritating kind of way.</i>

40:16.331 --> 40:19.275
<i>So, I let her show me her world.</i>

41:13.054 --> 41:14.656
Horsey!

41:34.742 --> 41:36.719
Mmm... Whoo!

41:41.207 --> 41:42.900
Bye-bye, horsey.

43:42.161 --> 43:47.142
<i>For the first time in my life,
I felt my heart torn two ways.</i>

43:53.589 --> 43:54.714
Hey, hey...

43:55.883 --> 43:57.985
No! Give it back! Come on!

43:58.469 --> 44:01.038
Mustang, no! Mustang!

44:01.973 --> 44:03.700
Oh, come on.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.475
Oh...

44:19.198 --> 44:20.641
Hmm?

44:52.440 --> 44:56.318
<i>I had to hand it to that boy,
he just wouldn't give up.</i>

45:45.785 --> 45:48.513
I'm never going to ride you, am I?

45:49.956 --> 45:52.024
And no one ever should.

46:18.109 --> 46:19.961
You can go.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.680
It's okay. Go.

46:33.249 --> 46:34.374
Go on, get out of here!

46:36.502 --> 46:38.104
Go home.

47:43.402 --> 47:47.405
<i>I knew this was hard for her
and that she was scared,</i>

47:47.406 --> 47:48.723
<i>but more than anything,</i>

47:49.283 --> 47:53.104
<i>I wanted to share my
homeland with her.</i>

48:50.094 --> 48:51.241
Ah!

51:46.520 --> 51:50.124
<i>I lay beside her
that night, hoping,</i>

51:50.733 --> 51:54.133
<i>praying that somehow
she would be okay.</i>

51:57.740 --> 51:59.907
There's a couple of
horses over there.

52:19.345 --> 52:20.992
Hyah!

52:24.350 --> 52:25.497
Ha!

52:25.517 --> 52:28.561
Leave the mare. She's
not going to make it.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.224
Come on.

52:45.746 --> 52:46.847
Come on!

53:01.053 --> 53:02.450
Oh, Rain.

53:02.554 --> 53:03.826
Oh...

53:05.474 --> 53:07.076
Easy, girl.

53:07.267 --> 53:08.710
Easy.

53:10.062 --> 53:11.709
It'll be okay.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.236
Come on.

53:18.237 --> 53:19.404
Hyah, hyah.

53:25.828 --> 53:27.805
You saved my life.

53:29.957 --> 53:31.499
Two more men on that brace!

53:31.500 --> 53:33.398
Collins! Evans!

53:33.877 --> 53:35.524
Bring it down!

53:36.839 --> 53:38.407
Let's go!

53:38.799 --> 53:41.426
Jackson, grab ahold of that end!

53:42.928 --> 53:44.075
Got it!

53:46.140 --> 53:47.287
This one's loaded.

53:56.775 --> 54:00.596
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.619
<i>Sound the bugle now</i>

54:25.804 --> 54:27.906
<i>Play it just for me</i>

54:30.559 --> 54:33.060
<i>As the seasons change</i>

54:33.061 --> 54:36.540
<i>Remember how I used to be</i>

54:38.525 --> 54:40.693
<i>Now I can't go on</i>

54:42.863 --> 54:45.136
<i>I can't even start</i>

54:47.576 --> 54:49.394
<i>I've got nothing left</i>

54:50.037 --> 54:52.981
<i>Just an empty heart</i>

54:55.876 --> 54:58.503
<i>I'm a soldier</i>

54:58.504 --> 55:03.280
<i>Wounded, so I must
give up the fight</i>

55:03.592 --> 55:07.929
<i>There's nothing more for me</i>

55:07.930 --> 55:10.158
<i>Lead me away</i>

55:14.895 --> 55:17.714
<i>Or leave me lying here</i>

55:33.205 --> 55:35.854
<i>Sound the bugle now</i>

55:37.501 --> 55:40.150
<i>Tell them I don't care</i>

55:41.505 --> 55:44.298
<i>There's not a road I know</i>

55:44.299 --> 55:47.699
<i>That leads to anywhere</i>

55:49.972 --> 55:54.100
<i>Without a light, I fear that</i>

55:54.101 --> 55:57.455
<i>I will stumble in the dark</i>

55:58.522 --> 56:01.107
<i>Lay right down</i>

56:01.108 --> 56:04.360
<i>Decide not to go on</i>

56:06.613 --> 56:09.866
<i>Then from on high</i>

56:09.867 --> 56:12.891
<i>Somewhere in the distance</i>

56:15.789 --> 56:18.207
<i>There's a voice that calls</i>

56:18.208 --> 56:21.778
<i>Remember who you are</i>

56:23.964 --> 56:26.132
<i>If you lose yourself</i>

56:28.677 --> 56:31.496
<i>Your courage soon will follow</i>

56:32.598 --> 56:36.077
<i>So be strong tonight</i>

56:39.605 --> 56:42.128
<i>Remember who you are</i>

56:55.370 --> 56:57.830
<i>Yeah</i>

56:57.831 --> 57:01.777
<i>You're a soldier now</i>

57:02.419 --> 57:05.944
<i>Fighting in a battle</i>

57:06.465 --> 57:09.785
<i>To be free once more</i>

57:11.386 --> 57:16.208
<i>Yeah, that's worth fighting for</i>

57:23.315 --> 57:26.025
Come on. Come on now.
It'll be all right.

57:26.026 --> 57:28.903
Come on. That's it. That's it.

57:46.004 --> 57:47.254
Let's go!

57:47.255 --> 57:48.948
Come on!

57:52.803 --> 57:55.596
<i>I didn't know why we
were brought here.</i>

57:55.597 --> 57:57.056
<i>What I did know</i>

57:57.057 --> 58:00.912
<i>was we had to find a way to
escape and get back home.</i>

58:01.353 --> 58:02.436
Clear!

58:07.234 --> 58:09.944
- No good! We hit bedrock!
- That's it.

58:09.945 --> 58:11.862
We're hauling the steamer
over the mountain.

58:11.863 --> 58:13.072
That's crazy.

58:13.073 --> 58:15.533
We got six days to
connect with Utah.

58:15.534 --> 58:17.682
We move out at dawn.

58:48.442 --> 58:50.109
Ready to go!

58:50.110 --> 58:51.235
Hyah!

58:51.236 --> 58:52.737
Move it out!

58:56.825 --> 58:58.472
Move it out!

59:15.719 --> 59:16.802
Hyah!

59:18.305 --> 59:19.388
Whoa!

59:20.682 --> 59:22.725
Get back in line!

59:39.076 --> 59:40.701
We're almost at the top!

59:40.702 --> 59:42.679
Slow down up front!

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:04.433
<i>That was the moment I understood.</i>

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:07.629
<i>They were headed to my homeland,
and I had to stop them.</i>

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.359
Get back!

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.944
Come on! Get back in line!

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.342
It's starting to slip!

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:18.132
Whoa! Pick up the slack!

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.350
Pick up the slack!

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.305
Hold it!

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:34.572
Get the mules up here!

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:45.996
Secure it on the left!

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:49.166
Good work, boys!

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.636
Hey!

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.341
Whoa!

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.175
Easy...

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.022
Get him. Get him.

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:13.752
Whoa!

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.086
Hurry! Bring the poles!

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.222
Hurry!

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.222
- Hold him there!
- Go!

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.170
They're breaking! I can't hold it!

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.397
Over here!

01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:59.240
Get out of the way!

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.099
Holy...

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:51.095
<i>I don't know where he came
from or how he got there</i>

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:53.745
<i>but I sure was happy to see him.</i>

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:21.959
Whoo-hoo!

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.090
Ah, ah!

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.283
Oh!

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:37.534
I knew I would find you.

01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:51.180
Halt!

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:00.581
I don't believe it.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.690
Go, go, go, go! Run! Run!

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.656
Come on, come on!

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:35.741
Whoo-hoo!

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.870
Hyah!

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:11.548
Yeah!

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.612
Ah!

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:22.890
Whoa!

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.563
That's it! Come on! Come on!

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.643
Get off!

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.464
Ooh! Aah!

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.597
Ooh!

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:02.099
Whoa!

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:06.937
Hyah!

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:11.612
We got them now!

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.316
Where did he go?

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.359
There they are! Up there!

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.511
Oh, no.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.140
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:16.044
Hyah.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.285
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.387
<i>Don't judge a thing
Till you know what's inside it</i>

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.806
<i>Don't push me, I'll fight it</i>

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:31.476
<i>Never gonna give it
Never gonna give it up, no</i>

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:32.728
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:36.648
<i>Ah, if you can't catch a wave
Then you're never gonna ride it</i>

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.401
<i>Can't come uninvited</i>

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:43.348
<i>Never gonna give it
Never gonna give it up, no</i>

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.325
<i>You can't take me</i>

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:50.600
<i>I'm free</i>

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:54.499
<i>Yeah, I'm free</i>

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.102
<i>Yeah...</i>

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.068
<i>Yeah...</i>

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.991
<i>Yeah...</i>

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.819
<i>Yeah...</i>

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:38.337
You will always be in my heart.

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:59.317
Take care of her,
Spirit-who-could-not-be-broken.

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.756
I will miss you, my friend.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.476
<i>I had been waiting
so long to run free</i>

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:46.281
<i>but that good-bye was harder
than I ever imagined.</i>

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.757
<i>I'll never forget that boy...</i>

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:52.279
<i>And how we won back
our freedom together.</i>

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:03.123
<i>I hear the wind</i>

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.857
<i>Call my name</i>

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:14.054
<i>The sound that leads me home again</i>

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.728
<i>It sparks up the fire</i>

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:22.021
<i>A flame that still burns</i>

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:26.980
<i>To you I will always return</i>

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.717
<i>I know the road is long</i>

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:37.039
<i>But where you are is home</i>

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.167
<i>Wherever you stay</i>

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:44.338
<i>I'll find the way</i>

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:48.400
<i>I'll run like the river</i>

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.845
<i>I'll follow the sun</i>

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:56.017
<i>I'll fly like an eagle</i>

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:59.619
<i>To where I belong</i>

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.394
<i>I can't stand the distance</i>

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:07.127
<i>I can't dream alone</i>

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:10.880
<i>I can't wait to see you</i>

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:14.634
<i>Yes, I'm on my way home</i>

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:17.846
<i>Now I know it's true</i>

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:21.827
<i>My every road leads to you</i>

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:25.588
<i>And in the hour of darkness</i>

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:31.568
<i>Your light gets me through</i>

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:35.048
<i>You run like the river</i>

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:39.060
<i>You shine like the sun</i>

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:40.910
<i>Yeah</i>

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:44.539
<i>You fly like an eagle</i>

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.395
<i>Yeah, you are the one</i>

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:53.757
<i>I've seen every sunset</i>

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:57.988
<i>And with all that I've learned</i>

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:00.972
<i>Oh...</i>

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:05.374
<i>It's to you I will always</i>

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:10.841
<i>Always return</i>

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:27.624
<i>Here I am</i>

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.751
<i>This is me</i>

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:34.198
<i>There's nowhere else on
Earth I 'd rather be</i>

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.841
<i>Here I am</i>

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.036
<i>It's just me and you</i>

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:44.015
<i>Tonight we make
Our dreams come true</i>

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.476
<i>It's a new world</i>

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.812
<i>It's a new start</i>

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:53.691
<i>It's alive with the beating
Of young hearts</i>

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:56.111
<i>It's a new day</i>

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.571
<i>It's a new plan</i>

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:02.017
<i>I've been waiting for you</i>

01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:04.811
<i>Here I am</i>

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:09.816
<i>Here I am</i>

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.887
<i>Here we are</i>

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.181
<i>We've just begun</i>

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:29.644
<i>And after all this time
Our time has come</i>

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.498
<i>Yeah, here we are</i>

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:35.066
<i>Still going strong</i>

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:38.888
<i>Right here in the
place where we belong</i>

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:42.157
<i>It's a new world</i>

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:44.242
<i>It's a new start</i>

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:49.372
<i>It's alive with the beating
Of young hearts</i>

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:51.583
<i>It's a new day</i>

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:54.002
<i>It's a new plan</i>

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.856
<i>I've been waiting for you</i>

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:59.700
<i>Waiting, waiting, waiting</i>

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.782
<i>Here I am</i>

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:05.763
<i>Baby, here I am</i>

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.182
<i>Here I am</i>

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.893
<i>Here I am
Here I am</i>

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:12.061
<i>Right next to you</i>

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.022
<i>Right next to you</i>

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:16.107
<i>Here I am</i>

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:20.653
<i>And suddenly the world
Is all brand-new</i>

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:21.779
<i>Here I am</i>

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.072
<i>Here I am</i>

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:24.157
<i>Whoa, whoa</i>

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.325
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:26.576
<i>Here I am</i>

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:27.894
<i>Here I am</i>

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:40.131
<i>I can't believe this moment's come</i>

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:44.578
<i>It's so incredible that we're alone</i>

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:48.370
<i>There's so much to be said and done</i>

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:53.478
<i>It's impossible not to be overcome</i>

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:57.732
<i>Will you forgive me
if I feel this way?</i>

01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.776
<i>'Cause we just met</i>

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:01.986
<i>Tell me that's okay</i>

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:04.306
<i>So, take this feeling</i>

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.157
<i>Make it grow</i>

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:07.825
<i>Never let it</i>

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:10.787
<i>Never let it go</i>

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:14.958
<i>Don't let go...</i>

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:18.378
<i>You give me something
That I can believe in</i>

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:22.734
<i>No, don't let...</i>

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:26.780
<i>Go of this moment in time</i>

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:31.997
<i>Don't let go...</i>

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:35.520
<i>I can't explain the
things that I'm feeling</i>

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:41.094
<i>No, don't let go...</i>

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:46.155
<i>I've been waiting all my life</i>

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:48.032
<i>All my life</i>

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.867
<i>To make this moment feel so right</i>

01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:52.370
<i>Feel so right</i>

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:56.582
<i>The feel of you just
fills the night</i>

01:19:56.583 --> 01:20:01.234
<i>So, come on let's
just hold on tight</i>

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:06.259
<i>Don't let go...</i>

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:09.887
<i>You give me something
that I can believe in</i>

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:13.583
<i>No, don't let...</i>

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:18.168
<i>Go of this moment in time</i>

01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:23.382
<i>Don't let go...</i>

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:26.904
<i>I can't explain the
things that I'm feeling</i>

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:28.698
<i>No, don't let...</i>

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:31.492
<i>No, I won't let</i>

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.641
<i>Go</i>

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:41.312
<i>No, don't let go...</i>

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:50.038
<i>No, I won't let go</i>

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:58.329
<i>I had a dream</i>

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:02.883
<i>Of the wide-open prairie</i>

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:09.803
<i>I had a dream</i>

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:14.303
<i>Of the pale morning sky</i>

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:21.227
<i>I had a dream</i>

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:28.276
<i>That we flew on golden wings</i>

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:31.867
<i>And we were the same</i>

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.639
<i>Just the same</i>

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.913
<i>You and I</i>

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:43.836
<i>Follow your heart</i>

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.550
<i>Little child of the west wind</i>

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:55.428
<i>Follow the voice</i>

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:59.936
<i>That's calling you home</i>

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:07.189
<i>Follow your dreams</i>

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:13.662
<i>But always remember</i> me

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.957
<i>I am your brother</i>

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:22.622
<i>Yeah, under the sun</i>

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.344
<i>We are</i>

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:32.635
<i>Like birds of a feather</i>

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.971
<i>We are</i>

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:38.141
<i>Two hearts joined together</i>

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:42.183
<i>We will be</i>

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:45.436
<i>Forever as one</i>

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:50.692
<i>My brother, under the sun</i>

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:56.663
<i>Under the sun</i>

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.415
<i>Under the sun</i>

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:13.840
<i>My brother, under the sun</i>

01:23:14.305 --> 01:23:20.198
