00:26.769 --> 00:28.479
<i>Come to Los Angeles.</i>

00:28.896 --> 00:30.647
<i>The sun shines bright.</i>

00:30.898 --> 00:33.025
<i>The beaches are wide and inviting.</i>

00:33.275 --> 00:37.112
<i>And the orange groves stretch</i>
<i>as far as the eye can see.</i>

00:37.863 --> 00:41.200
<i>There are jobs aplenty. Land is cheap.</i>

00:41.450 --> 00:43.702
<i>Every workingman</i>
<i>can have his own house.</i>

00:43.952 --> 00:48.290
<i>And inside every house,</i>
<i>a happy all-American family.</i>

00:48.749 --> 00:50.959
<i>You can have all this, and who knows?</i>

00:51.835 --> 00:53.754
<i>You could even be discovered...</i>

00:54.171 --> 00:57.257
<i>... become a movie star,</i>
<i>or at least see one.</i>

00:57.633 --> 00:59.885
<i>Life is good in Los Angeles.</i>

01:00.219 --> 01:02.888
<i>It's paradise on earth.</i>

01:04.723 --> 01:06.809
<i>That's what they tell you, anyway.</i>

01:07.059 --> 01:08.852
<i>Because they're selling an image.</i>

01:09.103 --> 01:12.690
<i>They're selling it through</i>
<i>movies, radio and television.</i>

01:12.940 --> 01:16.777
<i>In the hit show,</i> Badge of Honor,
<i>the L.A. Cops walk on water...</i>

01:17.069 --> 01:18.904
<i>... as they keep the city clean</i>
<i>of crooks.</i>

01:20.489 --> 01:22.950
<i>You'd think this place</i>
<i>was the Garden of Eden.</i>

01:23.242 --> 01:24.952
<i>But there's trouble in paradise...</i>

01:25.661 --> 01:30.082
<i>... and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,</i>
<i>Mickey C to his fans.</i>

01:30.499 --> 01:32.960
<i>Local L.A. Color to the nth degree.</i>

01:33.544 --> 01:35.462
<i>And his number one bodyguard...</i>

01:35.713 --> 01:37.423
<i>... Johnny Stompanato.</i>

01:37.673 --> 01:40.467
<i>Mickey C's the head of organized crime</i>
<i>in these parts.</i>

01:40.759 --> 01:44.054
<i>He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.</i>

01:44.304 --> 01:45.889
<i>He kills a dozen people a year.</i>

01:46.515 --> 01:49.059
<i>And the dapper little gent</i>
<i>does it in style.</i>

01:49.810 --> 01:52.438
<i>And every time his picture's</i>
<i>on the front page...</i>

01:52.938 --> 01:55.691
<i>... it's a black eye for the</i>
<i>image of Los Angeles.</i>

01:56.066 --> 01:58.610
<i>Because how can organized crime exist...</i>

01:58.861 --> 02:01.947
<i>... in the city with the best</i>
<i>police force in the world?</i>

02:02.281 --> 02:03.741
<i>Something has to be done.</i>

02:04.033 --> 02:06.994
<i>But nothing too original</i>
<i>because this is Hollywood.</i>

02:08.078 --> 02:10.288
<i>What worked for Capone</i>
<i>would work for the Mickster.</i>

02:10.580 --> 02:12.249
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.793
Non-payment of federal income tax.

02:15.210 --> 02:19.048
<i>But all is not well. Sending Mickey up</i>
<i>has created a vacuum.</i>

02:19.381 --> 02:21.008
<i>And it's only a matter of time...</i>

02:21.258 --> 02:24.887
<i>... before someone with balls</i>
<i>of brass tries to fill it.</i>

02:25.220 --> 02:27.681
Remember, dear readers...

02:28.682 --> 02:30.267
...you heard it here first...

02:31.185 --> 02:32.978
...off the record...

02:33.645 --> 02:35.397
...on the Q.T...

02:35.898 --> 02:37.441
...and very...

02:37.775 --> 02:39.485
<i>... Hush-Hush.</i>

02:57.920 --> 02:59.880
You're like Santa Claus with that list.

03:00.172 --> 03:02.424
Except everyone on it's been naughty.

03:04.301 --> 03:06.345
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.

03:07.513 --> 03:08.514
Leave it for later.

03:08.764 --> 03:11.850
We got to pick up the booze
and get it to the station.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.105
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.

03:16.438 --> 03:20.275
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.

03:20.526 --> 03:23.320
Parole violation: Assault arising
from a family dispute.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.239
We won't be here but
they'll see him.

03:34.957 --> 03:36.041
Quit your whining!

03:36.333 --> 03:38.544
Quit whining all the time!
It makes me sick!

03:38.794 --> 03:39.878
Shut up!

03:55.144 --> 03:56.395
Who the hell are you?

03:56.812 --> 03:58.814
The ghost of Christmas past.

03:59.690 --> 04:01.233
Dance with a man for a change?

04:01.483 --> 04:03.027
You a smart ass?

04:16.540 --> 04:20.878
You'll be out in a year and a half.
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.

04:21.128 --> 04:25.174
Touch her again, I'll have you
violated on a kiddie-raper beef.

04:26.842 --> 04:29.470
You know what they do
to kiddie rapers in Quentin.

04:38.854 --> 04:40.522
You got someplace you can go?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.734
Go get yourself fixed up.

04:48.697 --> 04:49.865
Merry Christmas.

04:50.574 --> 04:53.035
- Merry Christmas, ma'am.
- Let's go, Bud.

04:53.202 --> 04:54.536
The guys are waiting.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.126
What do you do on <i>Badge of Honor</i> ?

05:01.377 --> 05:04.004
I'm the technical advisor.

05:04.254 --> 05:07.591
I teach Brett Chase how to
walk and talk like a cop.

05:08.050 --> 05:10.386
Brett Chase doesn't walk
and talk like you.

05:10.636 --> 05:12.846
That's because he's the
television version.

05:13.222 --> 05:15.557
America isn't ready for the real me.

05:15.808 --> 05:18.519
Is it true you arrested Bob Mitchum?

05:19.395 --> 05:23.774
The <i>Badge of Honor</i> guys like to pretend,
but the real thing must be a thrill.

05:24.066 --> 05:28.237
Why don't we go someplace quiet?
I'll give you the lowdown on Mitchum.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.823
Big V. Jack Vincennes.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.992
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.

05:33.242 --> 05:35.327
This is Sid Hudgens,
<i>Hush-Hush</i> magazine.

05:35.577 --> 05:38.122
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello yourself.

05:39.790 --> 05:40.791
What that's about?

05:41.083 --> 05:44.586
Her name was in a piece we did,
"Ingenue Dikes in Hollywood."

05:46.922 --> 05:49.466
My friend just sold reefer
to Matt Reynolds.

05:49.758 --> 05:52.845
He's tripping the light fantastic
with Tammy Jordan.

05:54.304 --> 05:56.265
Sorry, I lost you for a second.

05:56.515 --> 06:00.894
Contract players, Metro. Pinch them,
I do you up a nice feature next issue.

06:01.145 --> 06:03.605
- Plus your usual $50 cash.
- I need another $50.

06:03.814 --> 06:07.151
Two 20s for two patrolmen,
a dime for the watch commander.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.652
It's Christmas.

06:09.945 --> 06:11.196
No, it's not.

06:11.488 --> 06:13.615
It's felony possession of marijuana.

06:15.117 --> 06:18.537
Actually, it's circulation 36,000
and climbing.

06:18.829 --> 06:21.665
There's no telling where this will go.
Radio, television...

06:22.124 --> 06:25.794
Once you whet the public's appetite
for the truth, the sky's the limit.

06:31.008 --> 06:33.969
Sgt. Ed Exley, son of the
legendary Preston Exley.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.846
Must be a hard act to follow.

06:37.473 --> 06:40.642
Why not make a mark elsewhere?
Why become a cop?

06:41.143 --> 06:42.895
I like to help people.

06:43.145 --> 06:45.689
We heard 2 officers
were assaulted this evening.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.692
- What do you think of that?
- Goes with the job.

06:48.901 --> 06:50.778
Luckily, they're okay.

06:51.028 --> 06:52.946
Aren't you young to be
watch commander?

06:53.197 --> 06:54.114
It's only tonight.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.159
The married men have Christmas Eve off.

06:57.409 --> 06:59.286
That's a good lead for the story.

06:59.536 --> 07:01.038
Merry Christmas, Captain.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.124
- Captain Smith.
- Drop the formalities, Bobby.

07:04.333 --> 07:08.003
- It's Christmas Eve, call me Dudley.
- I got the story's title.

07:08.212 --> 07:11.006
I'm calling it
"Silent Night with the LAPD."

07:11.298 --> 07:12.716
That's grand.

07:13.717 --> 07:16.637
Remember that's "Smith"
with an "S."

07:19.515 --> 07:21.475
Thank you, Merry Christmas.

07:21.975 --> 07:22.976
Hold on, lads.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.648
Merry Christmas.

07:30.442 --> 07:33.153
I saw the results
on the lieutenant's exam.

07:33.404 --> 07:35.114
First out of 23.

07:35.531 --> 07:39.118
What'll it be, then? Patrol Division?
Internal Affairs? What?

07:39.410 --> 07:41.036
Detective Bureau.

07:47.084 --> 07:48.669
You're a political animal.

07:48.919 --> 07:51.964
You have the eye for human weakness,
but not the stomach.

07:54.216 --> 07:55.300
You're wrong, sir.

07:55.592 --> 07:59.263
Would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty...

07:59.513 --> 08:01.348
...to insure an indictment?

08:01.598 --> 08:03.642
- We've been over this.
- Yes or no?

08:05.144 --> 08:08.981
Would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?

08:09.356 --> 08:12.192
Would you shoot a hardened
criminal in the back...

08:12.443 --> 08:15.571
...in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer...

08:16.405 --> 08:17.865
Then for the love of God...

08:18.115 --> 08:19.825
...don't be a detective.

08:20.075 --> 08:22.703
Stick to assignments where you don't
have to make those choices.

08:23.287 --> 08:25.289
Dudley, I know you mean well...

08:25.581 --> 08:29.251
...but I don't need to do it
the way you did... or my father.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.587
At least get rid of the glasses.

08:32.837 --> 08:35.506
I can't think of a man
in the Bureau who wears them.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.810
If I ever get held up,
you better be here.

08:52.775 --> 08:53.942
Hi, Nick.

08:54.193 --> 08:55.611
I need a delivery.

08:55.861 --> 08:58.405
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.

08:58.656 --> 09:01.116
Sounds like a hell of a party.
Be right with you.

09:20.135 --> 09:21.220
Merry Christmas.

09:23.138 --> 09:25.015
Merry Christmas, Officer.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.769
That obvious?

09:29.645 --> 09:31.897
It's practically stamped
on your forehead.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.024
There you go.

10:07.182 --> 10:08.976
See what he wants, Buzz.

10:14.023 --> 10:16.025
Get lost, why don't you?

10:23.365 --> 10:25.492
Down!
Get your fucking head down.

10:25.743 --> 10:27.536
I got a license for that.

10:31.874 --> 10:34.585
Cut me some slack.
I used to be a cop.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.837
"Leland Meeks"?
Never heard of you.

10:37.338 --> 10:38.589
They call me Buzz.

10:39.673 --> 10:43.052
I don't give a rat's ass.
Keep your head down.

10:43.302 --> 10:45.095
And stay there... Buzz.

10:48.140 --> 10:49.391
You okay?

10:49.850 --> 10:50.809
She's fine.

10:51.268 --> 10:52.603
I'm not asking you.

10:54.646 --> 10:55.647
Who hit you?

10:55.939 --> 10:57.900
It's not what you think.

11:01.362 --> 11:02.363
What, then?

11:02.613 --> 11:05.074
You got the wrong idea.
I'm fine.

11:06.575 --> 11:08.744
But it's nice to know you care.

11:17.836 --> 11:18.837
Drive safely.

11:20.756 --> 11:21.840
What's going on?

11:25.928 --> 11:26.929
You know him?

11:27.262 --> 11:29.098
Yeah, I've seen him around.

11:30.974 --> 11:32.518
He used to be a cop.

11:39.316 --> 11:42.236
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on the Christmas tree.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.446
Put your camera right there.

11:44.697 --> 11:48.993
When I walk out, get the
movie premiere in the background.

11:49.243 --> 11:52.121
I like it, I like it.
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."

11:52.371 --> 11:55.332
I don't want those goddamn
floodlights of yours in my eyes.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.127
Consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?

11:58.460 --> 12:00.671
Come on. Get down.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.509
Go! Pop them!

12:10.014 --> 12:11.181
Freeze! Police!

12:12.224 --> 12:13.308
Jesus Christ!

12:13.559 --> 12:15.894
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

12:16.145 --> 12:17.229
My family's coming...

12:17.521 --> 12:20.774
- It'll be a nice Christmas gift.
- Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.

12:21.025 --> 12:22.026
Over here.

12:22.276 --> 12:24.236
- Just turn.
- Hold it. Got it!

12:25.279 --> 12:29.366
- The Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
- Take them. I'll get the evidence.

12:41.712 --> 12:44.173
"It's Christmas Eve
in the City of Angels.

12:44.423 --> 12:47.551
And while decent citizens sleep
the sleep of the righteous...

12:47.801 --> 12:49.470
...hopheads prowl for marijuana...

12:50.471 --> 12:53.766
...not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:

12:54.933 --> 12:57.478
Celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.

12:57.895 --> 13:02.024
Scourge of grasshoppers
and dope fiends everywhere."

13:02.816 --> 13:03.734
You like it?

13:06.487 --> 13:07.655
Yeah, subtle.

13:09.198 --> 13:10.115
What took you?

13:10.407 --> 13:13.410
My partner stopped
to help a damsel in distress.

13:13.661 --> 13:15.663
His priorities are all screwed up.

13:16.330 --> 13:18.207
Up to your old tricks again?

13:19.833 --> 13:23.587
Hollywood Jack, what brings you
to our humble station house?

13:23.879 --> 13:25.506
What are you doing here?

13:25.798 --> 13:27.716
You know, keeping the streets safe.

13:27.966 --> 13:30.344
Get these two dressed
and book them.

13:30.678 --> 13:33.222
- The party's upstairs.
- I'll be right up.

13:39.603 --> 13:40.479
What's that for?

13:40.729 --> 13:43.190
Aren't you watch commander tonight?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.316
Yeah. So?

13:44.566 --> 13:46.193
It's from <i>Hush-Hush</i> magazine.

13:46.443 --> 13:48.112
Buy yourself some loafers.

13:48.362 --> 13:50.823
No thanks, Jack.
You keep your payoff.

13:51.573 --> 13:52.741
I'm not interested.

14:00.916 --> 14:02.292
What's this?

14:02.584 --> 14:03.669
Six spics.

14:04.003 --> 14:07.339
The Mexicans who assaulted
Brown and Helenowski.

14:07.589 --> 14:10.426
I hear Helenowski bled 6 pints,
Brown's in a coma.

14:10.676 --> 14:12.386
They've got bruises
and muscle pulls.

14:12.636 --> 14:13.721
It's not what I heard.

14:14.013 --> 14:15.264
Lock them up.

14:15.514 --> 14:20.352
Stens, you guys hear what those taco
benders did to Helenowski and Brown?

14:21.562 --> 14:26.066
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're
reading Brown his last rites.

14:27.943 --> 14:31.113
Should make for a very
merry Christmas for them.

14:31.363 --> 14:32.197
Hey, guys.

14:32.573 --> 14:33.449
Guys.

14:33.949 --> 14:35.534
They brought the Mexicans in.

14:36.994 --> 14:38.245
They're downstairs.

14:40.664 --> 14:43.417
- Let's do it.
- Come on. Let's get them.

14:46.295 --> 14:48.005
The party's upstairs.

14:49.798 --> 14:51.383
This doesn't concern you.

14:52.426 --> 14:53.510
Come on, guys.

14:53.802 --> 14:54.887
You got work?

14:55.179 --> 14:56.263
Go back.

14:57.639 --> 15:00.809
- Come on, it's Christmas, help me out.
- Move it!

15:01.060 --> 15:03.270
I just got a few more questions.

15:03.604 --> 15:05.064
You don't have to be here.

15:05.689 --> 15:06.482
Go!

15:08.984 --> 15:12.404
You better get your partner
before he kills somebody.

15:15.491 --> 15:17.576
Teach him a lesson!
Get him, Stens!

15:18.786 --> 15:20.829
This is for ours, Poncho.

15:23.749 --> 15:24.583
Let me through!

15:26.543 --> 15:27.878
He didn't do nothing!

15:28.128 --> 15:29.922
What are you looking at?

15:31.465 --> 15:34.009
- Tell that Mexican to shut up!
- Move!

15:34.426 --> 15:35.427
You're sick!

15:37.763 --> 15:38.764
Stens!

15:41.433 --> 15:43.310
- Come on!
- Don't break it up!

15:43.852 --> 15:45.229
Get back! Get back!

15:45.729 --> 15:47.147
Fuck your mother!

15:47.398 --> 15:48.357
Fuck you!

15:51.860 --> 15:53.404
Stop! That's an order!

16:02.454 --> 16:03.956
You're all in my report!

16:24.059 --> 16:25.394
"Bloody Christmas."

16:25.894 --> 16:27.730
The press love to label.

16:29.231 --> 16:32.026
This is bigger than the police board.

16:32.276 --> 16:36.447
The grand jury's convening.
Indictments may be handed down.

16:36.739 --> 16:38.073
Will you testify?

16:38.407 --> 16:39.325
No, sir.

16:42.328 --> 16:43.495
District Attorney Loew?

16:44.788 --> 16:48.250
You and Officer Stensland
brought the liquor to the station.

16:48.751 --> 16:50.377
Stensland was already drunk.

16:51.420 --> 16:56.091
Appearing as a witness against him
could offset the damage to yourself.

16:57.051 --> 16:59.428
I won't testify against him
or anyone else.

17:00.012 --> 17:02.097
This man is a disgrace.

17:02.389 --> 17:06.060
Your badge and gun, officer.
You're suspended from duty.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.561
Dismissed.

17:26.829 --> 17:30.876
We need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the Department.

17:31.168 --> 17:34.296
Justice has to be served.
Of course I'll testify.

17:37.383 --> 17:40.427
I'm glad you feel that way.
Most of the men don't.

17:40.678 --> 17:43.305
They think silence and integrity
are the same.

17:43.722 --> 17:46.350
Not exactly the image of...

17:46.934 --> 17:48.727
...the new LAPD we're creating.

17:48.977 --> 17:51.897
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.

17:52.147 --> 17:54.775
- May I make a suggestion?
- By all means.

17:55.025 --> 17:59.238
The public will expect the Department
to sweep this under the carpet.

18:00.072 --> 18:01.156
Don't.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.576
Shift the guilt to men with
secure pensions.

18:04.827 --> 18:06.453
Force them to retire.

18:07.913 --> 18:09.832
But somebody has to swing.

18:10.082 --> 18:15.129
So indict, try and convict
Richard Stensland and Bud White.

18:15.671 --> 18:17.339
Secure them jail time.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.174
The message will be clear.

18:19.800 --> 18:24.680
The new LAPD will not tolerate officers
who think they're above the law.

18:25.764 --> 18:28.684
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman.

18:28.934 --> 18:32.938
He's had rotten fitness reports
from every C.O. He's ever served under.

18:33.188 --> 18:35.190
But White is a valuable officer.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.026
White's a mindless thug.

18:39.194 --> 18:43.198
He's just a man who can say "yes" to the
questions I asked you the other day.

18:43.824 --> 18:46.744
The Department and the public
need role models.

18:46.994 --> 18:50.039
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.

18:51.707 --> 18:52.541
Sergeant...

18:53.167 --> 18:54.793
...I'll promote you...

18:55.085 --> 18:56.545
...to Lieutenant.

18:56.795 --> 18:59.840
- Effective immediately.
- Detective Lieutenant.

19:01.967 --> 19:03.677
Ed, you're 30.

19:03.927 --> 19:07.473
Your father didn't make lieutenant
until he was 33.

19:07.765 --> 19:11.602
I know. I also know when he made
lieutenant, it was as a detective.

19:11.935 --> 19:14.229
Before we start polishing our laurels...

19:14.480 --> 19:17.024
...it'd look better if we had
a corroborative witness.

19:17.566 --> 19:20.986
That won't be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.

19:21.278 --> 19:22.821
Jack Vincennes.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.407
He hit one of the Mexicans.

19:26.075 --> 19:29.828
A veteran like Vincennes might
admit his own culpability...

19:30.329 --> 19:32.539
...but not a fellow officer's.

19:33.248 --> 19:36.085
Jack's the technical advisor
on <i>Badge of Honor.</i>

19:36.335 --> 19:37.836
He lives for it.

19:38.087 --> 19:39.755
That's how to get to him.

19:43.217 --> 19:45.427
I'd like you to observe, Ed.

19:49.098 --> 19:50.641
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

19:51.475 --> 19:52.851
Bright kid.

19:53.185 --> 19:55.062
You may well reap the benefit...

19:55.562 --> 19:58.107
...but are you prepared to be despised?

19:58.857 --> 20:00.275
Yes, sir, I am.

20:02.361 --> 20:03.278
So be it.

20:09.535 --> 20:11.870
Sergeant, we'll get right to it.

20:12.413 --> 20:16.500
Nine civilian witnesses identified
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.

20:16.750 --> 20:22.089
But we have a witness who will name
names and testify that you hit back...

20:22.339 --> 20:23.424
...after being hit.

20:23.924 --> 20:26.051
You'll testify against 3 officers...

20:26.301 --> 20:31.015
...who've already earned their pension,
and plead ignorance about the rest.

20:31.473 --> 20:33.392
No thanks. I'm not a snitch.

20:33.642 --> 20:37.062
I'll guarantee a slap on the wrist,
a brief suspension...

20:37.354 --> 20:40.607
...followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.

20:40.983 --> 20:43.777
Transfer out of Vice,
you're back on the show.

20:48.741 --> 20:49.742
The show?

20:50.326 --> 20:51.952
<i>Badge of Honor.</i>

20:53.579 --> 20:56.415
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.

20:58.876 --> 21:03.088
I doubt you've ever taken
a stupid breath. Don't start now.

21:03.672 --> 21:04.923
Okay, I'll do it.

21:08.886 --> 21:10.262
The grand jury hears...

21:10.512 --> 21:12.639
...your testimony tomorrow.
Dismissed.

21:23.942 --> 21:25.944
And so it goes...

21:26.403 --> 21:28.197
...Detective Lieutenant.

21:29.948 --> 21:32.409
Ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow.

21:32.743 --> 21:35.454
Wear a smart-looking suit
and ace them.

21:36.372 --> 21:37.456
And Ed...

21:37.748 --> 21:39.375
...lose the glasses.

21:49.718 --> 21:52.513
So you're the stellar witness.

21:52.763 --> 21:56.308
I should have known.
What's the Chief throwing you?

21:56.684 --> 21:57.601
Throwing me?

21:58.102 --> 21:59.770
What's the payoff?

22:00.145 --> 22:03.399
You're the payoff expert.
I'm just doing my duty.

22:03.649 --> 22:07.152
Come on. You're playing an
angle here, college boy...

22:07.444 --> 22:10.572
...so you don't have to hobnob
with the rank and file...

22:10.823 --> 22:12.491
...who'll hate you for snitching.

22:12.908 --> 22:15.452
If they make you detective, watch out.

22:15.995 --> 22:20.165
Some Bureau guys'll burn in this and
you'll be working with their friends.

22:20.416 --> 22:21.250
What about you?

22:22.126 --> 22:26.255
I'm snitching 3 old-timers who'll be
fishing in Oregon next week.

22:26.588 --> 22:28.507
Next to you, I'm clean...

22:28.757 --> 22:29.925
...and smart.

22:30.259 --> 22:32.720
<i>Edmund J. Exley to chambers.</i>

22:35.139 --> 22:35.973
And remember...

22:36.223 --> 22:39.893
...Bud White will fuck you for this
if it takes the rest of his life.

22:43.689 --> 22:45.274
Captain, what do you want?

22:46.442 --> 22:47.609
Call me Dudley.

22:48.193 --> 22:49.903
Dudley...

22:50.446 --> 22:51.280
...what do you want?

22:52.614 --> 22:56.118
Look, lad, I admire
your refusal to testify...

22:56.535 --> 22:58.537
...and your loyalty to your partner.

22:59.079 --> 23:00.748
I admire you as a policeman...

23:00.998 --> 23:05.502
...and your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job.

23:05.753 --> 23:09.048
And I'm impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.

23:10.132 --> 23:11.216
Do you hate them?

23:13.927 --> 23:15.012
What do you want?

23:19.558 --> 23:21.018
They're yours.

23:22.311 --> 23:23.145
Take them.

23:26.899 --> 23:28.359
There's no bill on me?

23:28.609 --> 23:31.070
- 4 witnesses recanted their testimony.
- Why?

23:31.320 --> 23:32.655
They had a change of heart.

23:32.905 --> 23:33.656
And Stensland?

23:34.156 --> 23:35.741
Your partner's through.

23:35.991 --> 23:38.077
Scapegoat on the Chief's orders.

23:38.369 --> 23:40.245
A year from his pension.

23:43.415 --> 23:46.585
- Exley?
- Exley got what he wanted.

23:46.835 --> 23:50.214
As a politician he exceeds even myself.

23:51.006 --> 23:53.842
The Department needs
smart men like Exley...

23:54.385 --> 23:55.761
...and direct men...

23:56.470 --> 23:57.554
...like you.

23:59.014 --> 24:03.018
Look lad, I need you for
an assignment the Chief's given me.

24:03.352 --> 24:05.688
A duty few men are fit for...

24:05.979 --> 24:07.439
...but you were born for.

24:08.232 --> 24:10.776
You'd be working
out of Homicide at City Hall.

24:11.068 --> 24:12.236
Homicide?

24:13.237 --> 24:14.697
Working cases?

24:15.864 --> 24:18.492
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.

24:19.034 --> 24:20.619
It's a muscle job.

24:21.870 --> 24:26.041
You'll do as I say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?

24:27.292 --> 24:28.919
In Technicolor, sir.

24:31.630 --> 24:34.675
<i>"Meet Tony Brancato</i>
<i>and Anthony Trombino...</i>

24:34.925 --> 24:38.387
<i>... two rising lieutenants</i>
<i>in the Mickey Cohen rackets.</i>

24:38.637 --> 24:41.515
<i>With the dapper little gent in prison...</i>

24:42.182 --> 24:45.019
<i>... who knows how far they'll go?</i>
<i>The sky's the limit.</i>

24:51.859 --> 24:52.693
<i>Oh, well. "</i>

25:05.831 --> 25:10.294
<i>"Meet Deuce Perkins,</i>
<i>Mickey Cohen 's narcotics lieutenant.</i>

25:10.544 --> 25:11.920
<i>Could he be behind the hits?</i>

25:12.713 --> 25:15.466
<i>Is he consolidating</i>
<i>organized crime power?</i>

25:21.597 --> 25:23.265
<i>I suppose not.</i>

25:28.771 --> 25:30.314
<i>One thing's for sure:</i>

25:30.564 --> 25:33.776
<i>2- man triggers are punching the tickets</i>
<i>on the Mickster's muscle. "</i>

25:43.160 --> 25:46.997
<i>"Meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD...</i>

25:47.247 --> 25:52.044
<i>... has set up a not-so-Welcome Wagon</i>
<i>to dishearten the criminal element...</i>

25:52.336 --> 25:55.589
<i>... from filling the void left by</i>
<i>Mickey's absence.</i>

25:55.839 --> 25:58.759
<i>When I know more, dear readers,</i>
<i>so will you.</i>

25:59.009 --> 26:01.679
<i>Off the record, on the Q.T...</i>

26:02.054 --> 26:03.597
<i>... and very...</i>

26:03.847 --> 26:05.641
<i>... Hush-Hush. "</i>

26:06.850 --> 26:10.771
<i>With Mickey Cohen in prison,</i>
<i>Los Angeles is organized-crime-free.</i>

26:11.146 --> 26:12.856
<i>The Chief wants to keep it that way.</i>

26:14.191 --> 26:17.194
In Cleveland, you're an
organized crime associate...

26:17.444 --> 26:21.198
...in desperate need of re-education
in the ways of polite society.

26:23.701 --> 26:25.452
I hear things.

26:25.703 --> 26:27.621
Like those 2-men shooter teams.

26:27.871 --> 26:29.915
They're 86ing Cohen's lieutenants.

26:30.165 --> 26:31.667
What do you want?

26:32.501 --> 26:34.294
We want you to go home.

26:38.924 --> 26:40.592
Picture-book smut, men.

26:40.843 --> 26:44.513
There's been a bunch of this
found at crime scenes lately.

26:44.763 --> 26:47.725
Quality ranges from piss-poor...

26:48.976 --> 26:49.810
...to very well done.

26:50.811 --> 26:52.813
Look who's back from suspension.

26:53.605 --> 26:55.607
We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

26:55.858 --> 26:59.236
Look at that.
The Great Jerk-Off Case of 1953.

26:59.611 --> 27:01.780
Is there someplace you'd rather be?

27:02.406 --> 27:05.534
Yeah, working Narcotics,
looking for Cohen's missing H.

27:05.826 --> 27:09.872
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.

27:10.122 --> 27:13.208
You should've thought of that
before Bloody Christmas.

27:14.293 --> 27:17.963
Make a major case. It's the only way
you'll get out of here.

27:19.631 --> 27:21.008
Dismissed, gentlemen.

27:29.224 --> 27:31.185
Go get the facts, Jack.

27:31.435 --> 27:33.187
Just the facts.

27:40.778 --> 27:42.112
<i>Whatever you desire.</i>

27:42.488 --> 27:45.115
Hi. I'd like to get a delivery
to Beverly Hills.

27:45.491 --> 27:46.408
<i>I don 't know you.</i>

27:47.117 --> 27:51.455
A friend just gave me this number
and I wanted to find out if there was...

27:52.581 --> 27:56.418
Would you grab a reverse directory
and shag a name and address for me?

27:56.835 --> 27:58.629
Crestview-2239.

28:06.011 --> 28:08.222
<i>Hush-Hush, off the record, on the Q.T.</i>

28:08.806 --> 28:10.307
Sid, it's Vincennes.

28:10.683 --> 28:13.936
Jackie, you back on narco?
I need some good copy.

28:14.311 --> 28:16.188
I have something going with Vice.

28:16.563 --> 28:17.982
Something juicy for the Sidster?

28:18.232 --> 28:20.442
<i>Tracking porn.</i>
<i>Arty, high-class stuff.</i>

28:20.776 --> 28:23.737
Know about <i>Fleur-de-Lis</i> ?
Slogan's "Whatever you desire."

28:24.113 --> 28:25.614
<i>No, I've heard</i> bupkes.

28:25.990 --> 28:29.451
Get me some narco skinny.
I want to do an all-hophead issue.

28:29.827 --> 28:33.580
Shvartze <i>jazz musicians and movie stars.</i>
<i>You like it?</i>

28:33.872 --> 28:35.249
I'll talk to you later.

28:35.624 --> 28:38.002
- What do you got?
- The number's not assigned.

28:38.377 --> 28:39.294
Thanks, Ginger.

28:41.296 --> 28:42.464
A bootleg.

28:51.765 --> 28:52.766
Take it easy.

28:53.142 --> 28:54.476
Tough break, Stens.

28:54.852 --> 28:56.812
We're going to miss you.

28:57.187 --> 28:58.731
Raw deal, Stensland.

29:02.276 --> 29:03.902
Here comes the snitch.

29:15.164 --> 29:16.707
Sorry about that, Lieutenant.

29:33.766 --> 29:35.517
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

29:38.145 --> 29:40.272
I got some time.
I'll buy you a drink.

29:40.564 --> 29:42.566
Rain check. I got a hot date.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.779
Who is she and
what did you arrest her for?

29:47.321 --> 29:48.572
It's confidential.

29:48.989 --> 29:53.744
Like that magazine that
Vincennes scams for. <i>Hush-Hush.</i>

29:55.037 --> 29:56.747
I'll see you later in the week.

29:57.456 --> 29:59.249
We'll do the town, on me.

29:59.625 --> 30:02.503
Yeah. I'll bring
my wallet just in case.

30:06.965 --> 30:09.051
- See you tomorrow.
- Hang on a minute.

30:09.968 --> 30:11.345
I'll walk down with you.

30:20.104 --> 30:22.564
Punk kid. Who is he
trying to impress?

30:23.649 --> 30:24.733
Yeah, I wonder.

30:25.150 --> 30:27.319
Got himself a real career going.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.909
<i>Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.</i>

30:35.285 --> 30:36.829
<i>Sergeant Williams?</i>

30:40.165 --> 30:42.876
<i>Is there anybody up there in Homicide?</i>

30:44.003 --> 30:45.462
<i>Anybody there?</i>

30:47.840 --> 30:48.841
Lieutenant Exley.

30:49.091 --> 30:51.093
<i>You've got a homicide downtown.</i>

30:51.468 --> 30:54.221
<i>- The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.</i>
- I got it.

30:54.555 --> 30:55.556
It's mine.

31:07.318 --> 31:09.945
At least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee...

31:10.321 --> 31:12.990
No one comes through
the front door. Understand?

32:49.336 --> 32:53.173
I want barricades both ends
of the street. Make sure...

32:53.632 --> 32:55.551
I took the call. It's my case.

32:56.218 --> 32:58.303
You don't want it and you can't have it.

32:58.679 --> 32:59.555
I took the call.

32:59.930 --> 33:00.931
It's mine.

33:02.099 --> 33:03.892
I'll make you my second-in-command.

33:04.268 --> 33:05.894
Captain, over here, please.

33:10.232 --> 33:14.570
The cook drew a gun and set it off.
The rest died in the men's room.

33:20.617 --> 33:24.121
We got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

33:24.496 --> 33:28.500
I'm betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.712
Excuse me, we got an I.D.
on one of the victims.

33:32.421 --> 33:33.589
It's Dick Stensland.

33:36.425 --> 33:38.802
At first, I thought
she was Rita Hayworth.

33:39.178 --> 33:40.512
Yeah, me too.

33:50.314 --> 33:52.316
Hell of a way to avoid prison.

34:03.118 --> 34:04.286
What happened?

34:04.953 --> 34:07.331
Appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.

34:07.748 --> 34:10.501
The guy at the register pulled a.38,
so they killed him.

34:11.085 --> 34:12.710
Then they killed everyone else.

34:15.797 --> 34:18.676
Lieutenant, we're ready
with that Nite Owl I.D.

34:24.306 --> 34:26.141
Is this your daughter?

34:26.975 --> 34:28.560
I don't know.

34:29.478 --> 34:31.938
We know this is difficult.
Take your time.

34:33.815 --> 34:35.943
It seems like my Susan.

34:36.193 --> 34:39.071
But my Susan was a blonde,
not a redhead.

34:39.446 --> 34:41.197
When was the last time you saw her?

34:41.782 --> 34:43.659
Just before Christmas.

34:44.326 --> 34:47.204
We'd fought.
I didn't like her boyfriend.

34:47.830 --> 34:48.914
Mrs. Lefferts...

34:49.331 --> 34:51.667
...does your daughter have
any distinguishing marks?

34:52.876 --> 34:55.670
<i>You got the wrong idea, mister.</i>
<i>I'm fine.</i>

34:56.672 --> 34:59.675
She has a birthmark on her hip.

35:05.639 --> 35:07.057
It's her.

35:07.850 --> 35:09.893
My baby.

35:13.230 --> 35:14.898
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.

35:16.191 --> 35:18.485
Who's in charge of this investigation?

35:19.028 --> 35:20.446
Captain Smith and myself. Why?

35:23.198 --> 35:24.450
<i>"The Nite Owl Massacre."</i>

35:24.825 --> 35:26.452
Hyperbole aside...

35:26.827 --> 35:30.331
...this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution.

35:31.457 --> 35:32.291
Six victims.

35:32.708 --> 35:35.252
One of them, one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

35:35.711 --> 35:39.757
He was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

35:40.382 --> 35:42.092
Robbery is the likely motive.

35:42.343 --> 35:46.847
We have rubber glove smears
on the register and forensics...

35:47.222 --> 35:50.809
...tend toward a trio of shooters.
We do have one hot lead.

35:51.393 --> 35:53.187
Three Negro juveniles...

35:53.562 --> 35:56.982
...were seen discharging shotguns
last night in Griffith Park.

35:57.399 --> 36:01.320
A park ranger I.D.'d them as driving
a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe...

36:01.695 --> 36:02.863
...maroon in color.

36:03.530 --> 36:07.034
An hour ago a canvassing crew
turned up a news vendor...

36:07.368 --> 36:10.954
...who saw a maroon Merc coupe
parked by the Nite Owl at 1 a.m.

36:11.622 --> 36:15.209
DMV has come up with
a registration list of Merc coupes.

36:16.585 --> 36:20.964
48 two-man teams will shake
three names apiece.

36:21.757 --> 36:24.218
Interrogations will be led by
Lt. Edmund Exley.

36:27.846 --> 36:29.098
Enough on that!

36:32.476 --> 36:35.980
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.

36:37.314 --> 36:39.441
The people of Los Angeles demand it.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.235
Dismissed.

36:44.738 --> 36:46.657
Why not just put a bounty on them?

36:54.081 --> 36:57.126
- Ready to roll?
- You take them. I got something to do.

36:57.459 --> 36:59.253
What if one of these names...?

36:59.628 --> 37:01.005
Get somebody else.

37:01.964 --> 37:04.049
I got our assignments, Big V.

37:04.425 --> 37:07.302
If we go by this list,
we'll never make this collar.

37:07.678 --> 37:11.682
I got a guy who knows what happens
south of Jefferson. He'll put us at 50-50.

37:12.599 --> 37:16.645
What are you doing? That's the same
thing that got you in trouble before.

37:17.021 --> 37:18.272
I'll take those odds.

37:22.526 --> 37:23.861
We got it from here.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.574
You should bring along
a photographer.

37:33.662 --> 37:36.999
I need an address on a customer
of yours. Her name is Lynn.

37:37.374 --> 37:39.084
- That's all I got to go on?
- Yeah.

37:39.543 --> 37:41.837
You already know who I mean,
so cough it up.

37:42.379 --> 37:45.424
<i>There's a billing address</i>
<i>and a delivery address.</i>

38:12.201 --> 38:13.869
Are you Pierce Patchett?

38:15.079 --> 38:16.246
I am.

38:18.374 --> 38:22.378
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called my office.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.714
Go on down to the driveway.
We'll talk there.

38:36.850 --> 38:38.268
What can I do for you?

38:39.395 --> 38:42.898
- Where were you last night?
- I was here hosting a party.

38:44.733 --> 38:46.318
Tell me about Dick Stensland.

38:46.694 --> 38:48.737
I don't know him, Mr...?

38:49.196 --> 38:50.447
Officer White.

38:51.699 --> 38:52.783
You know Sue Lefferts?

38:53.242 --> 38:55.452
You know I do.
You saw me with her.

38:57.246 --> 38:58.789
How did you find me?

38:59.581 --> 39:03.585
Nick's Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

39:03.961 --> 39:05.421
Of course.

39:08.424 --> 39:10.467
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

39:11.218 --> 39:12.761
I'm investigating.

39:15.097 --> 39:16.473
Everything all right?

39:17.057 --> 39:18.809
Fine, Phillip, thank you.

39:23.105 --> 39:25.482
What happened to the other guy?
Buzz.

39:25.941 --> 39:28.110
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.

39:28.485 --> 39:30.821
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve
but didn't act it. Why?

39:31.196 --> 39:35.284
I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is... was...

39:35.659 --> 39:36.827
...a big doubles fan.

39:37.786 --> 39:40.664
You're a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder.

39:42.374 --> 39:45.794
- Want to go downtown to discuss it?
- Is this official?

39:46.754 --> 39:51.175
Somehow I have the feeling
this is more personal with you.

39:54.595 --> 39:55.971
All right, then...

39:56.972 --> 40:01.226
...are you concerned about criminal
matters peripheral to the murders?

40:01.602 --> 40:04.855
- Not at the moment.
- So you're not obligated to report them.

40:07.316 --> 40:09.401
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

40:09.860 --> 40:12.488
I needed a Rita Hayworth
to fill out my little studio.

40:12.863 --> 40:13.822
What little studio?

40:14.198 --> 40:17.701
Well, there's Gardner, Russell,
Monroe, Turner...

40:18.077 --> 40:20.204
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.

40:20.871 --> 40:23.165
I use girls that look like movie stars.

40:23.540 --> 40:26.001
Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.

40:26.669 --> 40:29.046
When the work was done,
that's when you saw us.

40:29.963 --> 40:31.674
It's why her mom couldn't I.D. her.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.718
Jesus fucking Christ.

40:34.968 --> 40:36.887
No, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.

40:39.348 --> 40:42.768
I sense you're on your best behavior,
but that's all I'm saying.

40:43.310 --> 40:45.229
If you persist,
we'll meet with my attorney.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.524
Would you like Lynn Bracken's address?

40:48.899 --> 40:50.401
I got her address.

40:51.819 --> 40:53.737
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.

40:54.405 --> 40:56.407
I'll give you a handsome reward.

41:01.829 --> 41:02.663
Whatever you desire!

41:11.380 --> 41:12.923
<i>I know you're not asleep.</i>

41:15.384 --> 41:17.219
<i>What do you want?</i>

41:17.594 --> 41:19.096
<i>My 5 bucks.</i>

41:19.471 --> 41:21.682
<i>It was the only one I had.</i>

41:22.057 --> 41:23.058
Right now?

41:23.726 --> 41:26.020
Hey, dollface,
tell him to leave us alone.

41:26.437 --> 41:28.564
I understand.
Okay, fine.

41:30.232 --> 41:31.233
Oh, baby...

41:32.735 --> 41:33.902
...bad news.

41:34.278 --> 41:35.237
You have to go.

41:35.612 --> 41:36.613
Go?

41:37.114 --> 41:40.409
Something very important has come up
and you have to go.

41:40.784 --> 41:42.494
I'll make it up to you.

41:42.870 --> 41:45.247
I will, I promise.
Excuse me.

41:47.916 --> 41:49.293
Is it the cops?

41:53.964 --> 41:55.049
Miss Bracken...

41:55.466 --> 41:56.258
...I'm Officer White.

41:56.633 --> 41:59.094
I've been expecting you,
just not this soon.

41:59.470 --> 42:01.930
Pierce called.
He told me what happened to Sue.

42:02.306 --> 42:05.267
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

42:05.768 --> 42:06.518
Hit the road.

42:09.104 --> 42:10.481
Maybe I will...

42:11.106 --> 42:12.483
...maybe I won't.

42:12.941 --> 42:16.445
LAPD, shitbird. Get out or
I'll have your wife come get you.

42:33.170 --> 42:34.588
- Officer.
- Councilman.

42:53.357 --> 42:56.694
- Would you care for a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch straight.

43:02.658 --> 43:06.161
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.

43:06.662 --> 43:07.830
Know what I mean?

43:08.330 --> 43:09.915
You sorry she's dead?

43:11.834 --> 43:13.210
Of course I am.

43:13.627 --> 43:15.379
What kind of question is that?

43:17.673 --> 43:19.800
You know why Pierce
is humoring you?

43:20.175 --> 43:22.428
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.

43:22.845 --> 43:23.846
But do you know?

43:24.346 --> 43:25.347
Yeah, I know.

43:26.515 --> 43:28.183
Patchett's running whores...

43:29.643 --> 43:31.478
...cut to look like movie stars.

43:31.854 --> 43:35.107
And judging by his address,
something bigger on the side.

43:35.482 --> 43:37.234
He doesn't want any attention.

43:37.651 --> 43:41.071
That's right. Our motives are selfish
so we're cooperating.

43:41.447 --> 43:44.199
So cooperate. Why was
Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

43:44.700 --> 43:47.161
I don't know. I never heard of
the Nite Owl till today.

43:47.536 --> 43:48.370
How'd she meet Patchett?

43:48.787 --> 43:50.247
Pierce meets people.

43:50.497 --> 43:54.418
Sue had dreams of Hollywood
and this is how they turned out.

43:55.044 --> 43:58.714
Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little.

43:59.381 --> 44:01.592
Tell me about Pierce.

44:02.092 --> 44:04.011
He's waiting for you to mention money.

44:05.387 --> 44:08.390
- Want some advice, Miss Bracken?
- It's Lynn.

44:08.891 --> 44:10.059
Miss Bracken...

44:11.060 --> 44:13.395
...don't ever try to fucking bribe me...

44:13.771 --> 44:16.065
...or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

44:17.232 --> 44:19.610
I remember you from Christmas Eve.

44:20.903 --> 44:23.989
You have a thing
for helping women, don't you?

44:24.907 --> 44:26.575
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

44:27.034 --> 44:30.245
- You say "fuck" a lot.
- You fuck for money.

44:30.579 --> 44:34.083
There's blood on your shirt.
Is that an integral part of your job?

44:34.375 --> 44:35.959
- Yeah.
- Do you enjoy it?

44:36.335 --> 44:37.169
When they deserve it.

44:37.586 --> 44:38.921
Did they deserve it today?

44:40.756 --> 44:41.590
I'm not sure.

44:42.049 --> 44:43.300
- But you did it anyway.
- Yeah.

44:44.218 --> 44:46.303
Like the half dozen guys
you screwed today.

44:47.763 --> 44:49.682
Actually, it was only two.

44:52.226 --> 44:54.019
You're different, Officer White.

44:54.395 --> 44:58.774
You're the first man in years who didn't
tell me I look like Veronica Lake.

44:59.149 --> 45:00.776
You look better than Veronica Lake.

45:06.490 --> 45:07.366
Pierce Patchett?

45:09.118 --> 45:11.829
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

45:12.204 --> 45:15.165
He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.

45:15.624 --> 45:19.378
Can your policeman's mentality
grasp those contradictions?

45:21.630 --> 45:23.757
He had you cut
to look like Veronica Lake.

45:24.174 --> 45:25.009
No.

45:25.759 --> 45:28.554
I'm really a brunette,
but the rest is me.

45:30.514 --> 45:32.975
And that's all the news
that's fit to print.

45:34.310 --> 45:36.186
It's nice meeting you.

45:40.983 --> 45:43.193
- I'd like to see you again.
- For a date...

45:43.485 --> 45:44.653
...or an appointment?

45:46.780 --> 45:47.781
I don't know.

45:48.240 --> 45:51.744
- If it's a date, what's your first name?
- Forget I asked.

45:52.953 --> 45:54.371
It was a mistake.

46:15.017 --> 46:16.393
Leonard Bidwell?

46:17.645 --> 46:19.521
Come down here and talk to us.

46:21.690 --> 46:22.858
How's the left these days?

46:23.525 --> 46:24.443
What's it to you?

46:24.860 --> 46:26.362
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.

46:26.862 --> 46:28.364
I like your style.

46:30.991 --> 46:32.743
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

46:33.661 --> 46:36.038
You got a brother in Folsom.
I put him there.

46:36.455 --> 46:37.289
Until 1970.

46:37.706 --> 46:39.583
How'd you like to make it 1960?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.211
I know the judge,
and Lieutenant Exley...

46:42.628 --> 46:44.630
...is good friends with the D.A.

46:47.341 --> 46:50.594
We're looking for 3 colored guys
who like to pop off shotguns.

46:50.969 --> 46:52.930
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

46:53.389 --> 46:56.392
- Want me to snitch?
- Want to buy your brother 10 years?

46:56.767 --> 46:58.477
- It was 10 years?
- 10 years.

46:58.852 --> 47:01.939
You don't have to say anything,
just look at this list...

47:02.398 --> 47:03.774
...and point.

47:06.235 --> 47:08.112
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.

47:08.737 --> 47:09.905
Sugar Ray Collins.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.408
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.

47:13.033 --> 47:14.618
Beautiful ride.

47:15.369 --> 47:19.456
Don't know about shotguns,
but he gets his thrills killing dogs.

47:19.915 --> 47:21.083
He's righteous trash.

47:21.583 --> 47:24.628
Look at that. It's five minutes
from here. Thanks.

47:26.922 --> 47:28.298
I'll hear from you...

47:29.466 --> 47:30.718
...about my brother?

47:31.135 --> 47:33.262
Keep it up, Lenny. Up.

47:39.393 --> 47:41.520
There it is.
It's in the back.

47:58.996 --> 48:01.457
- One of ours.
- Shit, somebody beat us here.

48:07.629 --> 48:08.797
Damn it.

48:09.465 --> 48:10.716
My glasses.

48:11.091 --> 48:12.176
You're kidding.

48:13.802 --> 48:15.679
Just don't shoot me.

48:24.647 --> 48:26.315
What are you doing here?

48:27.441 --> 48:29.026
We were in the neighborhood.

48:29.443 --> 48:32.863
- What do you got?
- Three 12-gauge pumps.

48:33.155 --> 48:33.864
And cash.

48:36.241 --> 48:38.786
So long, Vice.
<i>Badge of Honor,</i> here I come.

48:39.203 --> 48:40.829
Fuck you! This is our collar.

48:41.205 --> 48:42.206
Quiet!

48:42.581 --> 48:46.001
I'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team. End of story.

48:51.465 --> 48:52.383
Right.

48:53.842 --> 48:54.843
How many ways in?

48:55.260 --> 48:57.346
Only one. Up the stairs.

48:58.847 --> 49:00.724
He's very serious.

49:15.406 --> 49:16.240
Police!

49:16.490 --> 49:17.491
Don't shoot!

49:19.493 --> 49:21.578
- Don't move.
- Shut up!

49:21.829 --> 49:22.997
Anxious, aren't you?

49:23.414 --> 49:24.373
Don't kill them.

49:26.709 --> 49:28.168
Back, back, back!

49:29.545 --> 49:30.713
Get off me!

49:32.047 --> 49:33.424
Against the wall!

49:33.799 --> 49:35.467
- Put your hands up!
- Get over there.

49:36.719 --> 49:38.387
Shut up!
Hands behind your back!

49:39.722 --> 49:40.639
So...

49:41.348 --> 49:43.892
...how's it feel
getting out of the office?

49:50.107 --> 49:51.567
This came from forensics.

49:51.942 --> 49:53.319
"Burning clothes...

49:55.321 --> 49:56.572
...Casitas Youth Camp..."

50:00.117 --> 50:01.827
It's crowded in here, White.

50:02.494 --> 50:04.204
These guys killed Stensland.

50:20.929 --> 50:23.641
The ejection marks on the shells
fired from the shotguns...

50:24.016 --> 50:26.977
...are identical to those on the
shell casings found at the Nite Owl.

50:27.436 --> 50:29.271
I want confessions, Edmund.

50:29.730 --> 50:31.732
A night's stewing
has softened them up.

50:33.067 --> 50:34.485
I'll break them, sir.

50:54.838 --> 50:57.716
Are you sure golden boy
is up to the task, Cap?

50:58.467 --> 51:01.345
I think you'd be surprised
what the lad is capable of.

51:03.806 --> 51:05.724
You're 22, aren't you, Ray?

51:11.230 --> 51:12.982
Did an officer work you over?

51:15.401 --> 51:18.112
- You're 22, right?
- Why do you keep asking that?

51:18.487 --> 51:20.823
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.

51:21.323 --> 51:23.534
You should've pulled this 2 years ago.

51:23.909 --> 51:27.079
Get life, do a little
Youth Authority jolt...

51:27.329 --> 51:29.081
...transfer to Folsom a big man.

51:29.581 --> 51:31.291
Get yourself a sissy.

51:31.792 --> 51:33.544
I don't truck with sissies.

51:36.547 --> 51:37.548
Louis.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.258
What?

51:40.926 --> 51:43.470
You did the Casitas
Youth Camp with Louis.

51:43.762 --> 51:47.516
Why you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.

51:47.766 --> 51:51.103
Sugar, Louis told me
you went sissy up at Casitas.

51:51.520 --> 51:55.441
You couldn't do the time, so you got
a big white boy to look after you.

51:55.733 --> 51:57.359
Said they called you Sugar...

51:57.943 --> 52:00.154
...because you gave it out so sweet.

52:01.238 --> 52:05.284
<i>Louis gave it up at Casitas.</i>
<i>I was the boss jock in my dorm!</i>

52:05.534 --> 52:06.535
He was the sissy!

52:06.994 --> 52:10.914
Louis gave it up for candy bars!
He ain't got the sense of a dog!

52:12.124 --> 52:13.542
You like to shoot dogs.

52:14.043 --> 52:16.045
Dogs got no reason to live.

52:18.172 --> 52:19.506
What about people?

52:19.882 --> 52:21.467
What you trying to say?

52:21.967 --> 52:23.302
We got the shotguns.

52:23.677 --> 52:25.054
I don't own shotguns.

52:25.304 --> 52:27.640
Why were you throwing clothes
in the incinerator?

52:28.057 --> 52:28.891
Say what?

52:29.516 --> 52:33.812
A neighbor said she saw you
throwing clothes in the incinerator.

52:34.188 --> 52:35.189
Doesn't look good.

52:35.689 --> 52:37.608
I ain't talking till I see a judge.

52:37.983 --> 52:41.320
Were you on hop? You were
passed out when we arrested you.

52:41.695 --> 52:44.073
Ty and Louis fuck
with that shit, not me.

52:44.490 --> 52:46.075
Where do they get their stuff?

52:47.534 --> 52:48.535
Come on.

52:49.119 --> 52:52.206
Give me one to feed the D.A.
It'll make me look good...

52:52.581 --> 52:56.085
...and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk
like his sissy partners.

53:02.966 --> 53:05.094
Tell me where Jones and Fontaine...

53:05.552 --> 53:06.804
...get their drugs.

53:09.890 --> 53:11.266
Roland Navarette.

53:13.686 --> 53:15.479
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.

53:15.854 --> 53:17.773
And he sells red devils.

53:18.691 --> 53:20.192
Exley's good, I'll give him that.

53:20.567 --> 53:21.485
I'll take a break.

53:25.572 --> 53:28.450
You know, I'm talking
about the gas chamber...

53:29.493 --> 53:31.870
...and you haven't asked me
what this is about.

53:32.705 --> 53:35.249
You got a big "guilty" sign
around your neck.

53:40.087 --> 53:41.755
That was masterful.

53:42.256 --> 53:43.257
He's ready to go.

53:51.181 --> 53:53.642
Give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.

53:53.934 --> 53:56.312
Take the cuffs off so he can read it.

53:56.812 --> 54:00.399
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.

54:00.816 --> 54:04.987
I think it was Ray's idea.
You talk, I think I can save your life.

54:05.988 --> 54:08.657
6 people are dead,
and someone has to pay for it.

54:09.033 --> 54:11.869
Now, it can be you, or it can be Ray.

54:14.121 --> 54:15.873
Louis, he called you queer.

54:16.290 --> 54:20.044
- He said you took it up the ass.
- I didn't kill nobody!

54:22.504 --> 54:23.505
Son...

54:25.466 --> 54:27.926
...you know what'll happen
if you don't talk.

54:28.302 --> 54:31.096
You'll go to the gas chamber.
So admit what you did.

54:32.348 --> 54:33.932
I didn't mean to hurt her.

54:34.308 --> 54:37.061
- Maybe she's okay.
- Okay?

54:38.312 --> 54:41.607
They're in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.

54:41.940 --> 54:46.403
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don't die, so I don't die.

54:46.820 --> 54:49.198
She don't die, so I don't die.

54:49.615 --> 54:52.076
Louis, who's the girl?
What's her name?

54:52.785 --> 54:54.286
Who are you talking about?

54:54.995 --> 54:56.664
Was she at the Nite Owl?

54:57.331 --> 54:59.625
Listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?

55:07.091 --> 55:09.385
- This newspaper ain't shit!
- Where's the girl?

55:09.718 --> 55:10.469
You kill her?

55:11.470 --> 55:15.891
Louis lost his cherry, but things
got out of hand. You made her bleed.

55:16.266 --> 55:18.394
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.

55:18.811 --> 55:19.561
Who said that?!

55:21.021 --> 55:22.356
Now, listen to me.

55:22.731 --> 55:25.192
If she's alive, she's your
only chance.

55:25.442 --> 55:26.610
I think she's alive.

55:27.236 --> 55:28.487
Where is she now?

55:28.904 --> 55:30.614
You leave her someplace?

55:32.199 --> 55:33.701
Tell me where she is!

55:35.828 --> 55:37.454
What're you doing?!

55:37.705 --> 55:38.872
Don't.

55:40.040 --> 55:40.958
White!

55:42.209 --> 55:44.253
1 in 6! Where's the girl?

55:44.461 --> 55:46.005
I have this under control!

55:46.255 --> 55:47.631
Where's the girl?

55:56.098 --> 55:59.310
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...

56:00.144 --> 56:02.604
...brown corner house, upstairs.

56:15.159 --> 56:17.369
- Just give me one minute.
- You got it.

56:23.584 --> 56:24.960
<i>Nobody moves.</i>

56:25.544 --> 56:27.504
We're going in the front.
Stay put...

56:27.755 --> 56:29.214
<i>... until I give the word.</i>

58:54.777 --> 58:56.487
He went around back!

58:58.072 --> 59:02.159
I'm Lieutenant Exley. I'm sorry,
I need to know what time they left.

59:02.409 --> 59:04.703
Get her to the hospital.
Excuse me.

59:05.329 --> 59:06.705
Give your career a rest.

59:07.247 --> 59:08.332
Leave her alone.

59:08.749 --> 59:11.377
A naked guy with a gun?
Who'll believe that?

59:11.627 --> 59:13.337
Get the fuck away from me.

59:13.921 --> 59:18.342
- How will that look in your report?
- Like justice. That's what the man got.

59:18.759 --> 59:21.804
- Justice.
- You don't know the meaning of the word.

59:22.638 --> 59:25.849
You think it means getting
your picture in the paper.

59:26.100 --> 59:28.310
Go after criminals for a change.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.688
Stensland got what he deserved
and so will you.

59:45.661 --> 59:47.663
It's best to stay away
when his blood is up.

59:47.955 --> 59:49.415
His blood's always up.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.002
Perhaps you should
avoid him altogether.

59:53.919 --> 59:57.089
<i>Raymond Collins, Ty Jones</i>
<i>and Louis Fontaine.</i>

59:57.464 --> 01:00:00.009
<i>They are considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

01:00:00.426 --> 01:00:02.970
<i>Repeat. The Nite Owl</i>
<i>suspects have escaped.</i>

01:00:03.512 --> 01:00:05.347
How'd they get out the window?

01:00:05.597 --> 01:00:07.433
They jumped from the 2nd floor.

01:00:07.683 --> 01:00:11.812
Girl said they left her at 12.
They could get to the Nite Owl by 1.

01:00:12.855 --> 01:00:16.233
The question was,
where did they get their drugs?

01:00:16.483 --> 01:00:18.444
I haven't gotten that far yet.

01:00:18.861 --> 01:00:22.364
"Roland Navarette lives on Bunker Hill.
He runs a hole-up..."

01:00:24.742 --> 01:00:26.076
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

01:00:28.203 --> 01:00:29.621
Is something up?

01:00:29.997 --> 01:00:31.749
I need backup. Come on.

01:00:49.141 --> 01:00:51.226
- What?
- Nothing. Let's go.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.111
This should be it.

01:01:05.866 --> 01:01:06.700
404.

01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:29.431
Nobody moves!

01:01:30.808 --> 01:01:31.642
Stay right there!

01:01:31.892 --> 01:01:33.769
- You're under arrest.
- Don't shoot!

01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:35.562
Please don't shoot!

01:01:35.813 --> 01:01:36.897
Don't move!

01:02:28.907 --> 01:02:29.658
<i>There he is.</i>

01:02:30.868 --> 01:02:32.119
You did good, kid.

01:02:32.494 --> 01:02:35.622
You should've seen this place.
Blood everywhere.

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.667
Who would have thought?
Shotgun Ed.

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:41.170
Somebody get him cleaned up.

01:02:41.545 --> 01:02:42.421
Come on.

01:02:45.841 --> 01:02:49.595
<i>Edmund J. Exley</i>
<i>has amassed a brilliant record...</i>

01:02:50.012 --> 01:02:52.306
...in his 7 years with the
Los Angeles Police Department.

01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:55.601
Recently, he evinced
spectacular bravery in the line of duty.

01:02:55.976 --> 01:02:58.687
It is our privilege to present him
with our highest honor:

01:02:59.146 --> 01:03:00.689
The Medal of Valor.

01:03:01.065 --> 01:03:03.192
- What kind of car was it?
- It was a Ford.

01:03:03.609 --> 01:03:06.153
My husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.

01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:09.573
Excuse me, ma'am.
Just the facts. Light or dark?

01:03:09.948 --> 01:03:13.619
Light. And that's really
all I remember, Officer.

01:03:14.662 --> 01:03:16.538
Thank you.
You've been a big help.

01:03:17.206 --> 01:03:18.707
Cut!
That's a print.

01:03:19.083 --> 01:03:20.417
Big Jack!

01:03:21.085 --> 01:03:22.002
He's back!

01:03:22.378 --> 01:03:24.213
Jack's back.

01:03:57.454 --> 01:04:00.958
Tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention
of changing my vote.

01:04:12.678 --> 01:04:17.349
It may surprise some that an official
would admit to making a mistake...

01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:20.602
...but after due consideration...

01:04:21.353 --> 01:04:24.440
...I am changing my position
on the matter before the council.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.528
"Go west, America"
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.

01:04:29.903 --> 01:04:33.449
Today is that last step westward
with no stop signs...

01:04:33.866 --> 01:04:35.993
...no traffic signals, from downtown...

01:04:36.368 --> 01:04:38.329
...to the beach in 20 minutes.

01:05:09.276 --> 01:05:11.403
What were you going to start with?

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:14.948
Prostitution?

01:05:16.784 --> 01:05:17.951
Gambling?

01:05:21.455 --> 01:05:25.501
Go back to Jersey, sonny.
This is the City of the Angels...

01:05:25.793 --> 01:05:27.878
...and you haven't got any wings.

01:05:50.818 --> 01:05:53.028
Nice to see you again.
Take care.

01:06:30.482 --> 01:06:33.652
I wondered when you'd
knock on my door again, Officer White.

01:06:34.403 --> 01:06:35.404
It's Bud.

01:06:37.114 --> 01:06:38.115
Bud.

01:07:07.686 --> 01:07:08.687
Why me?

01:07:10.856 --> 01:07:11.940
I don't know.

01:07:48.686 --> 01:07:49.770
This election...

01:07:50.145 --> 01:07:53.273
...is about the future of
law enforcement in Los Angeles.

01:07:53.649 --> 01:07:56.610
City Councilman Rogers
represents that future.

01:07:57.027 --> 01:07:58.612
So let's dig deep...

01:07:58.988 --> 01:08:02.574
...and get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.

01:08:06.787 --> 01:08:09.748
Thank you, Brett Chase.
The talented star of <i>Badge of Honor.</i>

01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:14.795
Let me tell you,
I am so thrilled to be here.

01:08:16.587 --> 01:08:17.589
Big V.

01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:21.593
Good to see you back.

01:08:21.969 --> 01:08:24.595
- How they hanging, Sid?
- Down around my ankles.

01:08:24.971 --> 01:08:26.724
You tight with the D.A., Jackie?

01:08:28.183 --> 01:08:30.435
He tried to throw me
off the force last Christmas.

01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:32.270
How about some payback, big-time?

01:08:32.645 --> 01:08:37.234
Plus the usual $50 donation
to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:40.863
- Did you know the D.A. Was a swish?
- No kidding?

01:08:43.615 --> 01:08:46.577
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?

01:08:46.952 --> 01:08:49.412
- He just got off the honor farm.
- What's he doing here?

01:08:50.413 --> 01:08:52.791
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:55.377
I'm getting him
to fuck the D.A. For $ 100.

01:08:55.752 --> 01:08:58.546
That's twice the $50
you got for wrecking his career.

01:09:00.341 --> 01:09:02.801
- Come here, come here.
- Jesus, don't bring him...

01:09:07.848 --> 01:09:09.433
That's D.A. Loew right there.

01:09:14.813 --> 01:09:15.981
You need a drink?

01:09:16.982 --> 01:09:17.899
Yeah.

01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:20.109
Look after him.

01:09:20.527 --> 01:09:24.198
Matt, this is Jack.
No secrets between me and him.

01:09:29.662 --> 01:09:31.913
- How you doing?
- I'm okay. How're you?

01:09:32.206 --> 01:09:33.290
I'm good.

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:38.212
Have we met before?

01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:41.631
Yeah.

01:09:42.925 --> 01:09:44.093
Was it at a party?

01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:46.261
It was something like that.

01:09:47.971 --> 01:09:49.515
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:51.892
Right.

01:09:52.725 --> 01:09:54.103
Fleur-de-Lis.

01:09:54.853 --> 01:09:56.689
"Whatever you desire."

01:09:57.064 --> 01:09:59.608
Dope, hookers that
look like movie stars...

01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:01.944
...Pierce Patchett has it all.

01:10:03.028 --> 01:10:04.738
You could say that again.

01:10:05.114 --> 01:10:07.491
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.

01:10:09.326 --> 01:10:10.494
I dig him...

01:10:12.204 --> 01:10:13.038
...but you know...

01:10:14.289 --> 01:10:15.624
...he scares me too.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.501
Really?

01:10:18.168 --> 01:10:19.044
How?

01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:24.967
When I came out to L.A. This isn't
exactly where I saw myself ending up.

01:10:26.427 --> 01:10:27.511
Yeah, well...

01:10:27.886 --> 01:10:28.971
...get in line.

01:10:29.596 --> 01:10:31.557
Dutch courage, kid. Drink up.

01:10:36.562 --> 01:10:38.647
I don't think I should do this.

01:10:39.231 --> 01:10:41.317
It's not like you don't know how.

01:10:41.567 --> 01:10:46.071
Jack's connected to <i>Badge of Honor.</i>
Pull this off, you'll get a part.

01:10:46.447 --> 01:10:49.199
I smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?

01:10:51.952 --> 01:10:53.037
The D.A.'s free.

01:10:53.454 --> 01:10:55.914
Go introduce yourself. Go on.

01:10:56.415 --> 01:10:58.959
Tell him about the opening on the show.

01:11:00.252 --> 01:11:02.421
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part.

01:11:04.256 --> 01:11:09.386
But that's later on. Tonight, just
go over and pretend it's an acting job.

01:11:09.762 --> 01:11:11.013
Like show biz.

01:11:11.388 --> 01:11:12.473
Acting, that's it.

01:11:12.848 --> 01:11:13.599
Right.

01:11:13.974 --> 01:11:15.559
No one's going to know about this?

01:11:15.934 --> 01:11:16.560
No.

01:11:18.937 --> 01:11:20.439
It'll be our secret.

01:11:25.235 --> 01:11:27.613
- Show biz.
- That's it. Go on.

01:11:31.241 --> 01:11:32.868
Show biz.

01:11:34.953 --> 01:11:37.206
If Reynolds works his charms,
and he will...

01:11:37.456 --> 01:11:40.250
...they'll be at the Hollywood
Center Motel, room 203.

01:11:40.501 --> 01:11:42.586
Meet me there at midnight
for a photo shoot.

01:11:43.754 --> 01:11:46.799
Maybe we can work in
the Hollywood sign this time.

01:11:48.175 --> 01:11:49.802
You know Pierce Patchett?

01:11:51.637 --> 01:11:53.180
I know what you know.

01:11:53.555 --> 01:11:57.810
He's rich. Invested in the freeways,
which'll make him richer. Why?

01:11:59.186 --> 01:12:01.146
I keep hearing rumors.

01:12:01.522 --> 01:12:04.775
High-class porn, drugs, hookers
that look like movie stars.

01:12:05.901 --> 01:12:09.113
Patchett's what I call twilight.
He ain't queer or red.

01:12:09.613 --> 01:12:13.283
He cannot help me in my quest
for prime <i>sinnuendo.</i>

01:12:19.081 --> 01:12:23.002
As though <i>Badge of Honor</i> would
touch that guy with a 10-foot pole...

01:12:23.419 --> 01:12:26.422
...after he's been <i>Hush-Hush</i>
cover boy twice in one year.

01:12:26.797 --> 01:12:27.798
See you soon.

01:12:28.257 --> 01:12:32.094
Midnight. I guarantee all kinds
of illegal activity.

01:13:05.461 --> 01:13:06.545
Another, Jack?

01:13:52.007 --> 01:13:53.008
Kid?

01:14:01.016 --> 01:14:03.477
Come on, you don't have to do this...

01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:37.594
Thank you for what you did for me...

01:14:37.928 --> 01:14:40.472
...for killing those animals
who raped me.

01:14:40.889 --> 01:14:43.642
Will you thank Officer White
for me, please?

01:14:43.892 --> 01:14:44.893
Sure.

01:14:46.478 --> 01:14:50.399
Seeing him come through the door
is about the only thing I remember.

01:14:50.649 --> 01:14:51.650
Thank God.

01:14:52.776 --> 01:14:55.696
You remember what time
the Negroes left you?

01:14:55.946 --> 01:14:59.074
In your statement, you said
they left you at midnight.

01:14:59.325 --> 01:15:00.409
They might have.

01:15:05.956 --> 01:15:07.291
They "might" have?

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:11.086
I don't know what time they left me.
I wanted them dead.

01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:14.923
Would anyone care that they
raped a Mexican girl...

01:15:15.257 --> 01:15:18.177
...if they hadn't killed those
white people at the Nite Owl?

01:15:19.261 --> 01:15:21.513
I did what I had to do for justice.

01:15:22.431 --> 01:15:23.682
Exley, over here.

01:15:23.974 --> 01:15:24.975
Smile, Inez.

01:15:26.727 --> 01:15:28.479
Is he your hero?

01:15:29.188 --> 01:15:33.484
Fellas, how about this? "Rape Victim
Wheeled Out by Nite Owl Hero."

01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:41.367
All they get is Veronica Lake.

01:15:43.702 --> 01:15:45.913
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.

01:15:57.132 --> 01:15:58.133
"Bisbee"?

01:16:00.511 --> 01:16:01.929
I grew up there.

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:08.519
I'm going back in a couple of years,
open up a dress shop.

01:16:10.646 --> 01:16:13.732
The girls in Bisbee
need a little glamour.

01:16:19.405 --> 01:16:20.906
Where'd this come from?

01:16:22.741 --> 01:16:26.578
I was 12. My dad went after my mother
with a bottle. I got in the way.

01:16:28.747 --> 01:16:30.207
So you saved her.

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:32.918
Not for long.

01:16:36.171 --> 01:16:39.300
- I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
- He tied me to the radiator.

01:16:40.217 --> 01:16:43.304
I watched him beat my mother to death
with a tire iron...

01:16:45.848 --> 01:16:47.266
...and he left me there.

01:16:49.893 --> 01:16:52.771
Three days before
a truant officer found us.

01:16:56.066 --> 01:16:57.818
They never found the old man.

01:17:07.286 --> 01:17:09.163
Is that why you became a cop?

01:17:10.039 --> 01:17:11.290
To get even?

01:17:13.042 --> 01:17:14.043
Maybe.

01:17:16.086 --> 01:17:17.463
Do you like it?

01:17:20.883 --> 01:17:22.134
I used to.

01:17:24.261 --> 01:17:27.014
Now it's all strong-arm,
sitting duck stuff.

01:17:30.726 --> 01:17:34.563
If I could get a chance to work
Homicide like a real detective...

01:17:36.899 --> 01:17:39.610
That prick, Exley.
He shot the wrong guys.

01:17:40.277 --> 01:17:44.823
Whoever killed Stensland's still around.
I know it in here. I know it.

01:17:45.574 --> 01:17:47.368
Something's wrong
with the Nite Owl.

01:17:47.785 --> 01:17:49.828
I just can't prove it, that's all.

01:17:51.163 --> 01:17:52.998
I'm not smart enough.

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:58.295
I'm just the guy they bring in
to scare the other guy shitless.

01:18:01.632 --> 01:18:02.967
You're wrong.

01:18:03.926 --> 01:18:06.303
You found Patchett. You found me.

01:18:06.845 --> 01:18:08.555
You're smart enough.

01:18:20.317 --> 01:18:23.362
Bud White. What brings you
down to the basement?

01:18:27.157 --> 01:18:29.076
A couple of Nite Owl questions.

01:18:29.326 --> 01:18:32.413
Don't know if you read the papers,
but that case is closed.

01:18:34.456 --> 01:18:36.250
Anything bother you about it?

01:18:37.001 --> 01:18:40.671
The fact that the pack-up boys haven't
hauled this shit out of here yet.

01:18:45.384 --> 01:18:49.388
The suspects' 3 shotguns match
the strike marks on the shell casings.

01:18:50.514 --> 01:18:52.182
What more do you want?

01:19:04.069 --> 01:19:05.904
There's blood on the wall here.

01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:08.991
I thought everyone got shot
in the men's room.

01:19:09.241 --> 01:19:11.535
That is Stensland's blood.

01:19:13.704 --> 01:19:17.541
Blow to the head. Probably unconscious
when they dragged him in the john.

01:19:19.209 --> 01:19:20.544
They hit anyone else?

01:19:20.794 --> 01:19:24.006
No, but he was a cop.
Probably tried to do something.

01:19:27.926 --> 01:19:31.472
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone was sitting next to him.

01:19:35.601 --> 01:19:37.311
2 of the victims were women?

01:19:37.603 --> 01:19:41.440
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift
waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.

01:19:46.236 --> 01:19:47.946
Susan Lefferts.

01:19:49.698 --> 01:19:51.075
What about her?

01:19:54.286 --> 01:19:55.537
You're welcome!

01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:02.878
Mrs. Lefferts?

01:20:03.253 --> 01:20:05.089
I'm Officer White, LAPD.

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:11.345
Tell me about the boyfriend.
The one you mentioned at the coroner's.

01:20:11.595 --> 01:20:13.889
Susie, I told you
I didn't approve.

01:20:14.556 --> 01:20:18.852
He was too old for you.
And you let him be fresh with me.

01:20:20.729 --> 01:20:23.023
They came here one day
when I wasn't home.

01:20:23.607 --> 01:20:25.275
Mrs. Jensen next door said...

01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:29.071
...she saw Susie's boyfriend
and another man...

01:20:29.446 --> 01:20:31.115
...and she heard a ruckus.

01:20:31.907 --> 01:20:32.992
What was his name?

01:20:33.283 --> 01:20:35.828
We weren't properly introduced.

01:20:36.578 --> 01:20:38.747
He had a nickname, Muns or Luns.

01:20:39.123 --> 01:20:41.583
Stens? Was it Stens?

01:20:41.834 --> 01:20:42.918
Maybe.

01:20:43.294 --> 01:20:45.296
- I don't know.
- Look at this picture.

01:20:49.133 --> 01:20:50.217
That's him.

01:20:50.634 --> 01:20:51.635
That's him.

01:20:57.016 --> 01:20:59.351
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.

01:20:59.935 --> 01:21:00.853
Outside?

01:21:01.103 --> 01:21:02.021
Inside?

01:21:03.314 --> 01:21:04.481
Outside.

01:21:04.857 --> 01:21:08.694
And then Mrs. Jensen said
they kept going under the house.

01:21:12.906 --> 01:21:15.200
You have to leave now, Officer.

01:21:16.535 --> 01:21:19.913
- What's through here?
- Just a room full of old things.

01:21:20.164 --> 01:21:21.999
Don't move that.

01:21:24.501 --> 01:21:28.088
Don't mind the smell.
I think a rat died behind the wall.

01:21:29.465 --> 01:21:30.883
My Susie was a good girl.

01:21:31.634 --> 01:21:34.678
She was never in any
kind of trouble at all.

01:22:46.083 --> 01:22:48.294
<i>"Leland Meeks."</i>
<i>Never heard of you.</i>

01:22:48.711 --> 01:22:50.170
<i>They call me Buzz.</i>

01:22:57.261 --> 01:22:58.429
Was it a rat?

01:22:59.388 --> 01:23:01.140
Yeah, a great big one.

01:23:03.559 --> 01:23:04.560
Here.

01:23:05.561 --> 01:23:07.479
Compliments of the Police Department.

01:23:24.621 --> 01:23:27.416
Stomach of the week
from a motel homicide.

01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:31.253
Unemployed actor had frankfurter,
french fries, alcohol and sperm.

01:23:31.503 --> 01:23:33.881
Hell of a last supper,
don't you think?

01:23:34.131 --> 01:23:37.051
Anything bothering you
about the Nite Owl case?

01:23:37.593 --> 01:23:39.553
The fact that you guys
won't let it go.

01:23:40.763 --> 01:23:44.350
- What do you mean?
- Bud White grilled me on it today.

01:23:45.517 --> 01:23:46.602
Bud White?

01:23:47.394 --> 01:23:49.313
He's not as dumb as I thought.

01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:54.318
Did he say where he was going?

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:08.624
Let my daughter rest in peace!

01:24:08.874 --> 01:24:11.001
I just want to ask a few questions.

01:24:11.251 --> 01:24:13.629
Officer White already checked
under the house.

01:24:14.213 --> 01:24:15.297
Under the house?

01:24:16.048 --> 01:24:18.258
- Where?
- Out back.

01:24:19.843 --> 01:24:21.428
All he found was rodents.

01:24:24.807 --> 01:24:28.727
I need an I.D. on this as soon as
possible. Talk only to me on this one.

01:24:32.731 --> 01:24:33.649
I need your help.

01:24:33.941 --> 01:24:37.319
I'm busy. Why don't you ask
your boys in Homicide?

01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:42.950
I can't. I need someone
outside of Homicide.

01:24:43.659 --> 01:24:46.412
I want you to tail Bud White.

01:24:47.913 --> 01:24:50.082
Do me a favor. Leave me alone.

01:24:51.292 --> 01:24:53.585
You make the 3 Negroes
for the Nite Owl killings?

01:24:56.922 --> 01:24:57.756
What?

01:24:58.090 --> 01:24:59.425
It's a simple question.

01:25:01.635 --> 01:25:04.346
Why in the world
do you want to dig deeper...

01:25:04.722 --> 01:25:06.515
...into the Nite Owl killings...

01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:07.975
...Lieutenant?

01:25:11.854 --> 01:25:13.230
Rollo Tomasi.

01:25:15.441 --> 01:25:17.443
Is there more or do I have to guess?

01:25:20.612 --> 01:25:22.656
Rollo was a purse snatcher.

01:25:27.202 --> 01:25:29.163
My father ran into him off-duty.

01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:34.251
He shot my father 6 times
and got away clean.

01:25:35.878 --> 01:25:37.504
No one knew who he was.

01:25:38.505 --> 01:25:40.549
I made the name up
to give him personality.

01:25:42.426 --> 01:25:43.427
Your point?

01:25:44.136 --> 01:25:46.764
Rollo Tomasi's the reason
I became a cop.

01:25:47.681 --> 01:25:51.060
I wanted to catch the guys who
thought they could get away with it.

01:25:52.645 --> 01:25:54.396
It was about justice.

01:25:55.397 --> 01:25:58.275
Then somewhere along the way
I lost sight of that.

01:26:02.529 --> 01:26:03.781
Why'd you become a cop?

01:26:14.416 --> 01:26:16.043
I don't remember.

01:26:22.883 --> 01:26:24.051
What do you want?

01:26:24.843 --> 01:26:26.387
I want to solve this.

01:26:27.137 --> 01:26:28.722
Nite Owl was solved.

01:26:31.684 --> 01:26:32.851
I want to do it right.

01:26:33.686 --> 01:26:35.896
Even if it means
paying the consequences?

01:26:39.566 --> 01:26:41.276
All right, college boy, I'll help.

01:26:41.819 --> 01:26:44.446
But there's a case your boys
in Homicide don't care about.

01:26:44.822 --> 01:26:48.575
They think it's just another
Hollywood "homo"-cide. But I don't.

01:26:49.618 --> 01:26:52.746
You help me with mine,
I'll help you with yours.

01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:54.164
Deal?

01:26:55.332 --> 01:26:56.125
Deal.

01:27:28.657 --> 01:27:30.617
Johnny Stompanato.

01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:34.621
Officer Wendell White.
How's tricks, <i>paesano?</i>

01:27:34.997 --> 01:27:36.498
I ain't your <i>paesano.</i>

01:27:37.416 --> 01:27:39.460
I ain't in the snitch business anymore.

01:27:39.793 --> 01:27:41.837
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?

01:27:43.047 --> 01:27:44.757
Works for Pierce Patchett.

01:27:45.466 --> 01:27:46.550
Should I?

01:27:48.052 --> 01:27:50.763
You're muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.

01:27:51.138 --> 01:27:52.306
You tell me.

01:27:54.391 --> 01:27:56.185
Yeah, I remember now.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:00.022
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.
Same as you'll be some day.

01:28:00.397 --> 01:28:01.857
That's all you'll get.

01:28:02.733 --> 01:28:04.443
Keep your $20.

01:28:10.074 --> 01:28:13.494
What do I get if I give you your
balls back, you wop cocksucker?

01:28:17.873 --> 01:28:20.042
There was a rumor going around...

01:28:20.417 --> 01:28:23.420
...that Meeks had a line
on a large supply of H.

01:28:25.589 --> 01:28:26.423
And?

01:28:27.257 --> 01:28:28.509
And nothing!

01:28:28.884 --> 01:28:30.427
He skipped out.

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.024
Bullshit.

01:28:45.067 --> 01:28:48.195
How would Meeks get his hands
on a large supply of heroin?

01:28:49.113 --> 01:28:50.197
You're right.

01:28:50.447 --> 01:28:52.241
It's probably bullshit.

01:28:52.616 --> 01:28:54.994
Even if he did,
he couldn't unload it.

01:28:55.452 --> 01:28:57.913
Not without drawing
all kinds of attention.

01:28:58.497 --> 01:29:02.334
Maybe that's why he's under a house
in Elysian Park not smelling too good...

01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:05.129
<i>... paesano.</i>

01:29:57.765 --> 01:30:00.142
Maybe White's
not so dumb after all.

01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:17.368
<i>We got Rita Hayworth at the morgue,</i>
<i>and now Veronica Lake with White.</i>

01:30:18.035 --> 01:30:22.247
I think your case and my case
are connected. It's Fleur-de-Lis again.

01:30:22.539 --> 01:30:23.624
Fleur-de-Lis?

01:30:24.708 --> 01:30:26.168
"Whatever you desire."

01:30:26.543 --> 01:30:27.544
Porno.

01:30:28.045 --> 01:30:30.714
High-class whores
cut to look like movie stars.

01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:34.510
Who knows what else? Reynolds,
the kid that got killed, was involved.

01:30:34.885 --> 01:30:36.345
So is Pierce Patchett.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.888
The millionaire?

01:30:38.555 --> 01:30:40.432
I think we should talk to him.

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:43.227
First I want to brace Stompanato.

01:30:59.618 --> 01:31:01.954
Want an autograph?
Write to MGM.

01:31:02.955 --> 01:31:06.083
Since when do two-bit hoods
and hookers give out autographs?

01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:07.626
What?

01:31:07.876 --> 01:31:09.128
LAPD. Sit down.

01:31:09.378 --> 01:31:11.505
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:31:11.755 --> 01:31:13.132
Take a walk, honey.

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:16.677
- You're making a large mistake.
- Get away from our table.

01:31:17.052 --> 01:31:17.970
Shut up.

01:31:19.596 --> 01:31:21.724
A hooker cut to look like Lana Turner
is still a hooker.

01:31:22.933 --> 01:31:25.311
- She just looks like Lana Turner.
- She is Lana Turner.

01:31:26.937 --> 01:31:28.689
She is Lana Turner.

01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:39.658
How was I supposed to know?

01:31:55.966 --> 01:31:59.637
I believe the Nite Owl's
your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.

01:32:00.054 --> 01:32:02.514
I saw you on television
getting your medal.

01:32:04.183 --> 01:32:05.267
And you're...

01:32:05.809 --> 01:32:09.563
...that other Hollywood
celebrity policeman, aren't you?

01:32:10.648 --> 01:32:14.485
The Veronica Lake look-alike works
for you. She's one of your whores.

01:32:15.944 --> 01:32:19.114
- A vulgar term.
- Why's she seeing Bud White?

01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:22.993
Why do men and women
usually see each other?

01:32:26.038 --> 01:32:28.499
Let's try this on for size:
Fleur-de-Lis.

01:32:29.166 --> 01:32:30.876
"Whatever you desire."

01:32:31.627 --> 01:32:33.045
An actor named...

01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:34.546
...Matt Reynolds.

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.257
Nothing?

01:32:40.469 --> 01:32:42.179
We want some answers.

01:32:45.015 --> 01:32:46.767
We all want something.

01:32:49.186 --> 01:32:51.146
The guy's as cool as they come.

01:32:53.691 --> 01:32:56.402
<i>Lieutenant Exley,</i>
<i>come in, please. Over.</i>

01:32:57.653 --> 01:32:58.404
Exley.

01:32:58.696 --> 01:33:01.573
<i>The coroner wants to talk to you.</i>
<i>He says he has your I.D.</i>

01:33:02.241 --> 01:33:05.035
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes
is coming in to talk to him.

01:33:05.411 --> 01:33:07.496
- I'll drop you at your car.
- Where are you going?

01:33:07.871 --> 01:33:09.039
Lynn Bracken's.

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:14.044
To find out why Patchett has her seeing
Bud White. See you at the Frolic Room.

01:33:14.878 --> 01:33:18.090
Oh, great. You get the girl.
I get the coroner.

01:33:28.225 --> 01:33:31.103
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the q.t.

01:33:34.898 --> 01:33:37.443
I was just coming to see you.
Got that I.D.?

01:33:37.735 --> 01:33:42.114
Thank God for dental records.
Stiff used to be a cop. Leland Meeks.

01:33:42.364 --> 01:33:43.282
Buzz Meeks?

01:33:43.532 --> 01:33:44.867
- You knew him?
- Of him.

01:33:45.117 --> 01:33:48.787
He was around when I joined the force.
Bad rep. Thanks.

01:33:49.413 --> 01:33:50.664
"Just the facts."

01:33:50.914 --> 01:33:52.583
"Just the facts."

01:33:56.086 --> 01:33:57.004
Anything else?

01:33:57.379 --> 01:34:01.216
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39-'41.
I need to see his arrest records.

01:34:08.474 --> 01:34:09.308
Miss Bracken...

01:34:09.725 --> 01:34:10.893
...I'm Lieutenant Exley.

01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:12.311
I know.

01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:14.813
Bud told me all about you.

01:34:15.272 --> 01:34:16.357
Is that so?

01:34:17.483 --> 01:34:19.360
And what did White have to say?

01:34:20.944 --> 01:34:22.821
He said you were smart.

01:34:23.614 --> 01:34:27.284
He also said you were a coward, and that
you'd screw yourself to get ahead.

01:34:28.077 --> 01:34:30.162
Let's concentrate on my smarts.

01:34:30.621 --> 01:34:35.417
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.

01:34:36.627 --> 01:34:38.462
And I'm impressed with the results.

01:34:39.922 --> 01:34:41.090
But I need answers.

01:34:41.507 --> 01:34:44.468
And if I don't get them,
I'll take you and Patchett down.

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:47.805
Pierce Patchett
can take care of himself.

01:34:49.014 --> 01:34:50.849
And I'm not afraid of you.

01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:54.311
And you forget one thing, Lieutenant...

01:34:54.853 --> 01:34:57.314
...Pierce also taught me how to fuck.

01:35:01.193 --> 01:35:02.945
And he tells you who to fuck.

01:35:03.445 --> 01:35:05.322
Why are you fucking Bud White?

01:35:05.698 --> 01:35:08.701
What makes you think
I'm not seeing Bud because I want to?

01:35:10.536 --> 01:35:13.747
It would be easier for you
if there was an angle, wouldn't it?

01:35:14.665 --> 01:35:17.543
You're afraid of Bud because you can't
figure out how to play him.

01:35:18.836 --> 01:35:21.922
He doesn't follow
the same rules of politics as you do.

01:35:22.798 --> 01:35:24.425
It makes him dangerous.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.884
I can handle Bud White.

01:35:26.343 --> 01:35:27.344
Can you?

01:35:31.515 --> 01:35:33.600
I see Bud because I want to.

01:35:37.187 --> 01:35:40.399
I see Bud because
he can't hide the good inside of him.

01:35:42.359 --> 01:35:44.987
I see Bud because he makes me feel
like Lynn Bracken...

01:35:45.362 --> 01:35:48.574
...and not a Veronica Lake
look-alike who fucks for money.

01:35:50.868 --> 01:35:55.039
I see Bud because he doesn't
know how to disguise who he is.

01:35:57.207 --> 01:36:00.711
I see Bud for all the ways
he's different from you.

01:36:03.255 --> 01:36:05.215
Don't underestimate me.

01:36:05.883 --> 01:36:08.761
The way you've
underestimated Bud White?

01:36:15.351 --> 01:36:18.020
Fucking me and fucking Bud
aren't the same thing.

01:36:18.562 --> 01:36:20.439
Stop talking about Bud White.

01:36:45.464 --> 01:36:47.257
Come on.

01:36:50.094 --> 01:36:51.261
Shit.

01:37:04.775 --> 01:37:06.360
Jack Vincennes.

01:37:07.444 --> 01:37:08.988
It's going on midnight.

01:37:09.488 --> 01:37:11.156
I need 2 minutes, Dudley.

01:37:11.657 --> 01:37:12.658
It's important.

01:37:13.450 --> 01:37:17.663
Good thing for you my wife and daughters
are at the beach in Santa Barbara.

01:37:20.958 --> 01:37:23.419
Do you remember Buzz Meeks?

01:37:23.711 --> 01:37:25.921
A disgrace as a police officer.

01:37:26.297 --> 01:37:30.342
Straight D fitness reports from every
C.O. He ever served under. Why?

01:37:31.135 --> 01:37:33.887
12 years ago, he was on a vice roust
with Dick Stensland.

01:37:34.263 --> 01:37:37.433
They questioned Pierce Patchett
about a blackmail scam.

01:37:37.808 --> 01:37:41.854
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing
prominent businessmen with hookers.

01:37:42.646 --> 01:37:45.482
Anyway, charges were dropped.
Insufficient evidence.

01:37:45.858 --> 01:37:50.195
You were the supervising officer on
that case. Remember anything about it?

01:37:51.613 --> 01:37:53.032
What's this about, boyo?

01:37:53.949 --> 01:37:57.453
It has to do with a murder
I've been working with Exley on.

01:37:57.995 --> 01:38:00.456
You're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.

01:38:00.873 --> 01:38:02.875
Since when do you work with Exley?

01:38:04.168 --> 01:38:06.378
It's a private investigation.

01:38:08.631 --> 01:38:11.091
I messed something up.
I'm trying to make amends.

01:38:11.342 --> 01:38:15.012
Don't start trying to do the right
thing. You haven't had the practice.

01:38:22.728 --> 01:38:25.564
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.

01:38:28.817 --> 01:38:31.362
So, what does Exley make of this?

01:38:32.029 --> 01:38:35.157
I haven't told him yet.
I just came from the records room.

01:39:01.058 --> 01:39:03.143
Have you a valediction, boyo?

01:39:09.566 --> 01:39:11.068
Rollo...

01:39:12.236 --> 01:39:13.779
...Tomasi.

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.220
<i>Sergeant Vincennes was killed</i>
<i>by a.32 slug to the heart.</i>

01:39:38.595 --> 01:39:40.806
<i>Time of death, approximately 1 a.m.</i>

01:39:41.515 --> 01:39:46.729
Although he was found in Echo Park,
forensics indicates the body was moved.

01:39:47.771 --> 01:39:51.025
I want 2-man teams to scour
that entire neighborhood.

01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:54.320
Our justice must be swift...

01:39:54.737 --> 01:39:56.196
...and merciless.

01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:59.408
That is all.

01:40:09.293 --> 01:40:11.128
Might I have a word with you?

01:40:14.423 --> 01:40:17.301
We're trying to run down a lead
on an associate of Vincennes.

01:40:17.676 --> 01:40:20.346
The records check has led to a dead end.

01:40:20.763 --> 01:40:21.847
What's the name?

01:40:22.306 --> 01:40:23.682
Rollo Tomasi?

01:40:25.768 --> 01:40:27.645
You ever heard Vincennes mention him?

01:40:30.648 --> 01:40:32.191
No. No, I haven't.

01:40:36.987 --> 01:40:38.906
It's probably nothing. Still...

01:40:40.157 --> 01:40:42.076
...keep your eyes open, boyo.

01:40:52.378 --> 01:40:54.922
I know it's unlikely, but suppose...

01:40:55.339 --> 01:40:58.717
...somebody had a lot of heroin,
who would they go to to move it?

01:40:59.301 --> 01:41:01.261
White, in my office.

01:41:01.637 --> 01:41:04.098
Captain. Look, just give me a name.

01:41:05.015 --> 01:41:06.183
Mickey Cohen.

01:41:12.356 --> 01:41:13.273
Captain?

01:41:13.524 --> 01:41:15.985
I could use your fearsome
habits at the Victory Motel.

01:41:17.528 --> 01:41:18.529
When?

01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:21.031
Now.

01:41:23.367 --> 01:41:24.910
Close the door, lad.

01:41:32.543 --> 01:41:35.421
You're a bit of a
puzzlement to me these days.

01:41:35.838 --> 01:41:38.007
You don't seem your old cruel self.

01:41:38.716 --> 01:41:41.593
And I had such grand plans
for your future.

01:41:41.844 --> 01:41:42.928
What plans?

01:41:44.513 --> 01:41:48.350
You have your extracurricular
activities and I have mine.

01:41:51.562 --> 01:41:54.606
We must have a clarification
session one of these days.

01:41:55.733 --> 01:41:56.650
However...

01:41:57.568 --> 01:41:58.736
...right now...

01:41:59.403 --> 01:42:02.614
...we'll brace a man who may know
who killed Jack Vincennes.

01:42:02.948 --> 01:42:04.617
So the question is...

01:42:05.034 --> 01:42:06.535
...can I count on you, lad?

01:42:06.785 --> 01:42:08.495
- Yes or no?
- Yes, sir.

01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:17.379
I want to know everything you and
Vincennes talked about last night.

01:42:17.713 --> 01:42:19.673
Start with the I.D. on the corpse.

01:42:19.923 --> 01:42:20.924
An ex-cop.

01:42:21.342 --> 01:42:23.093
Leland "Buzz" Meeks.

01:42:23.469 --> 01:42:24.637
An ex-cop?

01:42:25.304 --> 01:42:26.680
Did Jack know him?

01:42:27.431 --> 01:42:29.266
Only by reputation.

01:42:35.481 --> 01:42:37.608
Wendell, this is Sid Hudgens.

01:42:37.858 --> 01:42:40.569
I'm willing to cooperate.
No need to tie me down.

01:42:40.944 --> 01:42:42.655
It's for your own safety.

01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:46.867
What can you tell us
about Sgt. Jack Vincennes?

01:42:47.117 --> 01:42:49.203
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.498
I can tell you he's on
the night train to the Big <i>Adios.</i>

01:42:56.794 --> 01:43:00.214
I had nothing to do with him
getting killed, if that's what you mean.

01:43:00.589 --> 01:43:04.426
- But you were business associates.
- What's that got to do with anything?

01:43:06.387 --> 01:43:08.472
Okay, so we worked together.

01:43:09.098 --> 01:43:11.100
It was an information exchange.

01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:15.604
I got him first-class collars, he got me
good stories. We were friends.

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:17.439
We'll drop that for now.

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:19.775
What about Pierce Patchett?

01:43:20.025 --> 01:43:23.946
You think he had something to do
with Vincennes getting iced?

01:43:24.905 --> 01:43:28.033
I'd like full and docile
cooperation on every topic.

01:43:28.742 --> 01:43:31.120
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

01:43:32.788 --> 01:43:35.582
Everyone knows Patchett's
worth a boatload.

01:43:36.125 --> 01:43:37.835
But he has hobbies too.

01:43:38.210 --> 01:43:40.671
He bankrolls B movies under the table.

01:43:41.213 --> 01:43:42.715
And try this one on.

01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:45.217
He's rumored to be a heroin sniffer.

01:43:45.509 --> 01:43:48.429
All in all, a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o.

01:43:48.721 --> 01:43:50.639
- And?
- And what?

01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:58.397
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens,
is the key to every relationship.

01:44:01.734 --> 01:44:03.235
He runs call girls.

01:44:05.237 --> 01:44:08.198
Primo tail fixed up
to look like movie stars.

01:44:11.076 --> 01:44:11.910
And?

01:44:12.578 --> 01:44:14.038
Blackmail shit.

01:44:14.955 --> 01:44:17.082
In my car, in the trunk,
under the rug...

01:44:18.042 --> 01:44:22.212
Patchett got me to photograph this cop
screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.

01:44:22.463 --> 01:44:24.548
She looks just like Veronica Lake.

01:44:26.050 --> 01:44:26.842
Leave him!

01:44:27.092 --> 01:44:28.677
I said leave him be!

01:44:29.053 --> 01:44:30.387
Get him away from me!

01:44:31.639 --> 01:44:32.514
Back off!

01:45:16.809 --> 01:45:21.647
I wouldn't trade places with Exley right
now for all the whiskey in Ireland.

01:45:25.818 --> 01:45:29.405
Dudley, I thought you were going to
let the dumb bastard kill me!

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.408
Learn to pull your punches
a little better.

01:45:32.825 --> 01:45:34.785
You can uncuff me now, fellas.

01:45:40.582 --> 01:45:41.750
Fellas...

01:45:43.752 --> 01:45:44.670
...we had a deal.

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.422
You, me, Patchett. We're a team.

01:45:51.593 --> 01:45:52.845
Hush-hush.

01:45:54.096 --> 01:45:55.973
- Anything?
- Nothing.

01:45:56.348 --> 01:45:58.976
Meeks never made an arrest
the entire time he worked Vice?

01:45:59.351 --> 01:46:01.145
Someone must've pulled the files.

01:46:03.856 --> 01:46:05.649
What about the daily report books?

01:46:06.025 --> 01:46:09.111
- They'd be buried in the basement.
- Find them.

01:46:40.184 --> 01:46:41.685
You talk to Exley?

01:46:42.269 --> 01:46:43.896
Come in out of the rain.

01:46:46.065 --> 01:46:48.025
What happened with Exley?

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.111
Just come in.

01:46:52.571 --> 01:46:55.115
Will you tell me
what happened with Exley?

01:46:55.824 --> 01:46:57.076
We talked.

01:46:57.743 --> 01:46:58.827
Tell me about him.

01:46:59.119 --> 01:47:00.120
Later.

01:47:01.121 --> 01:47:02.122
Now!

01:47:05.459 --> 01:47:07.002
You fucked him.

01:47:10.714 --> 01:47:12.049
You fucked him.

01:47:12.883 --> 01:47:14.885
I thought I was helping you.

01:48:05.936 --> 01:48:08.147
I'm glad you're here.
I need you to see this.

01:48:17.823 --> 01:48:18.741
Wait.

01:48:45.643 --> 01:48:47.061
Dudley killed Jack.

01:48:47.811 --> 01:48:49.521
He wants you to kill me.

01:48:52.733 --> 01:48:54.735
He showed you the photo, didn't he?

01:48:55.569 --> 01:48:56.570
Didn't he?

01:48:59.239 --> 01:49:01.200
Think! Goddamn you, think!

01:49:03.953 --> 01:49:05.037
Get out!

01:49:21.512 --> 01:49:23.722
I checked the daily report books.

01:49:24.848 --> 01:49:28.185
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and
Stensland go way back.

01:49:31.897 --> 01:49:33.649
I knew Stensland lied to me.

01:49:36.777 --> 01:49:39.738
Lefferts' mother I.D.'d
him as Lefferts' boyfriend.

01:49:41.615 --> 01:49:46.078
Stensland pretended he didn't know
Meeks or her the night that I met...

01:49:47.538 --> 01:49:48.622
...Lynn.

01:49:49.665 --> 01:49:51.083
Stensland and Meeks...

01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:53.252
...what were they up to?

01:49:54.211 --> 01:49:57.548
I don't know. But I think
Stens killed Meeks over heroin.

01:49:58.090 --> 01:49:59.091
What heroin?

01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:08.600
Johnny Stompanato told me
that Meeks had heroin for sale.

01:50:09.059 --> 01:50:10.644
Meeks ends up dead.

01:50:11.228 --> 01:50:13.355
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.

01:50:14.315 --> 01:50:15.983
It wasn't the Negroes.

01:50:17.067 --> 01:50:19.028
The rape victim lied.

01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:23.073
The first guys to the Mercury coupe
were Breuning and Carlisle.

01:50:23.449 --> 01:50:24.825
Dudley's guys.

01:50:25.367 --> 01:50:27.119
They planted the shotguns.

01:50:27.369 --> 01:50:30.789
They'd have killed the Negroes too
if Jack and I hadn't shown up.

01:50:31.665 --> 01:50:34.877
Dudley framed them because
they were Negroes and had records.

01:50:35.169 --> 01:50:37.630
He knew there'd be no questions asked...

01:50:39.173 --> 01:50:41.550
...if they were killed resisting arrest.

01:50:42.593 --> 01:50:44.887
Somehow it's all connected
to Jack's angle.

01:50:45.596 --> 01:50:46.930
Sid Hudgens...

01:50:47.514 --> 01:50:49.642
...the pictures to blackmail
Ellis Loew...

01:50:50.809 --> 01:50:52.061
A kid got murdered.

01:50:53.228 --> 01:50:55.397
To figure it out,
we must work together.

01:51:01.111 --> 01:51:02.821
Why are you doing this?

01:51:04.823 --> 01:51:06.533
The Nite Owl made you.

01:51:08.452 --> 01:51:10.079
You want to tear all that down?

01:51:11.705 --> 01:51:13.374
With a wrecking ball.

01:51:13.999 --> 01:51:15.793
Want to help me swing it?

01:51:28.097 --> 01:51:30.099
Let's go see Ellis Loew.

01:51:30.683 --> 01:51:33.352
Find out what
the District Attorney knows.

01:51:41.443 --> 01:51:43.070
You can't go in there.

01:51:45.364 --> 01:51:48.575
- Want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
- Ask for Capt. Dudley Smith.

01:51:48.784 --> 01:51:52.538
Tell him we're discussing an unemployed
actor's death at a Sunset Strip motel.

01:51:52.788 --> 01:51:53.789
These are the police.

01:52:00.587 --> 01:52:01.755
What do you want?

01:52:02.047 --> 01:52:06.302
I want D.A. Bureau men to tail Dudley
Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.

01:52:06.593 --> 01:52:09.930
I want you to get a judge to authorize
wiretaps on their home phones.

01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:12.474
I want authorization
to check their bank records.

01:52:13.017 --> 01:52:14.435
On what evidence?

01:52:15.019 --> 01:52:16.729
Call it a hunch.

01:52:17.938 --> 01:52:19.648
Absolutely not.

01:52:19.898 --> 01:52:22.818
Dudley Smith is a highly-decorated
member of the department.

01:52:23.068 --> 01:52:25.029
I won't smear his and
Patchett's name without...

01:52:25.279 --> 01:52:26.655
Without what?

01:52:27.072 --> 01:52:28.782
Them smearing yours first?

01:52:29.158 --> 01:52:32.828
What do they have? Pictures of you
and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?

01:52:35.205 --> 01:52:36.206
You have proof?

01:52:36.957 --> 01:52:38.667
The proof had his throat slit.

01:52:40.044 --> 01:52:42.171
So far, you're not denying it.

01:52:43.547 --> 01:52:45.507
I won't dignify this with answers.

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:48.135
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me...

01:52:48.427 --> 01:52:52.264
...I have a press conference for Jack
Vincennes that I have to prepare for.

01:53:02.608 --> 01:53:06.445
Unless you came to wipe my ass,
I believe we're through.

01:53:11.158 --> 01:53:15.496
Don't pull that good-cop-bad-cop crap.
I practically invented it.

01:53:16.288 --> 01:53:18.457
So what if some homo actor is dead.

01:53:18.707 --> 01:53:21.752
Boys, girls. Ten of them
get off the bus to L.A. Everyday.

01:53:29.677 --> 01:53:30.928
Pull him off me!

01:53:31.178 --> 01:53:32.054
I don't know how.

01:53:36.058 --> 01:53:39.895
I know you think you're the A-number-one
hotshot, but here's the juice.

01:53:40.145 --> 01:53:42.523
If I kill you, 10 lawyers
will take your place tomorrow.

01:53:42.773 --> 01:53:44.608
They just won't come on a bus.

01:53:58.539 --> 01:53:59.623
Okay!

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.210
Dudley and Patchett, they...

01:54:04.336 --> 01:54:05.337
Oh, my God!

01:54:05.671 --> 01:54:07.673
I wouldn't play ball so they set me up!

01:54:07.923 --> 01:54:09.967
I gave in!
But the kid heard everything...

01:54:11.468 --> 01:54:12.428
...so they killed him.

01:54:12.678 --> 01:54:13.679
Why?

01:54:14.054 --> 01:54:17.433
- What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
- Taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.

01:54:17.683 --> 01:54:21.603
Because of those pictures
I couldn't prosecute them!

01:54:21.979 --> 01:54:23.314
Oh, Jesus!

01:54:23.564 --> 01:54:24.481
Help me up!

01:54:33.657 --> 01:54:35.784
Is that how you ran
the good-cop bad-cop?

01:54:38.370 --> 01:54:39.538
Patchett?

01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:17.618
Looks like his bodyguard
had a conflict of interest.

01:55:24.041 --> 01:55:25.417
Suicide note.

01:55:25.668 --> 01:55:30.047
Says he killed Jack because Jack had
figured out his pornography scam.

01:55:30.297 --> 01:55:32.424
Slicing himself open wasn't his idea.

01:55:33.884 --> 01:55:35.302
2 of his fingers are broken.

01:55:35.552 --> 01:55:36.470
They held him there.

01:55:38.722 --> 01:55:39.640
Or drugged him.

01:55:43.102 --> 01:55:44.853
Dudley's tying up his loose ends.

01:55:45.729 --> 01:55:46.981
Patchett's dead.

01:55:47.272 --> 01:55:48.899
He sent you after me.

01:55:50.567 --> 01:55:51.735
Lynn.

01:55:52.903 --> 01:55:54.071
West Hollywood Sheriff.

01:55:54.321 --> 01:55:57.157
- They're closer than we are.
- I'll get the car. Keys!

01:56:04.665 --> 01:56:07.209
We took her to the station
for safekeeping.

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:11.797
Hold her as Joan Smith.
And no one sees her unless I okay it.

01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:14.300
Someone worked her over.

01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:16.176
She wouldn't say who.

01:56:21.348 --> 01:56:22.975
See you, Exley.

01:56:26.186 --> 01:56:27.688
We should talk to Lynn.

01:56:28.689 --> 01:56:29.857
You do it.

01:56:30.566 --> 01:56:31.650
What will you do?

01:56:34.945 --> 01:56:36.864
I'm going to talk to Sid Hudgens.

01:56:37.615 --> 01:56:40.242
Compliment him on his
performance at the Victory Motel.

01:56:40.492 --> 01:56:42.661
Remember, Bud, we need evidence.

01:56:43.871 --> 01:56:45.331
I'll get the evidence.

01:56:57.885 --> 01:56:58.886
Are you okay?

01:57:01.639 --> 01:57:02.640
You okay?

01:57:13.317 --> 01:57:15.277
Bud hates himself for what he did.

01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:18.572
I know how he feels.

01:57:20.908 --> 01:57:23.744
I need to know what you
can give me on Dudley Smith.

01:57:25.829 --> 01:57:28.207
He's a police captain
in business with Patchett.

01:57:28.916 --> 01:57:30.459
I've never heard of him.

01:57:34.672 --> 01:57:36.256
Do you have a place to stay?

01:57:38.008 --> 01:57:39.510
I'll be okay.

01:57:46.141 --> 01:57:48.477
Nobody goes in without official I.D.

01:57:53.190 --> 01:57:54.858
It's okay. Let him through.

01:57:58.445 --> 01:57:59.822
What happened?

01:58:00.364 --> 01:58:03.367
Someone beat him to death,
and stole a bunch of files.

01:58:03.617 --> 01:58:05.619
Must have dug up garbage
on the wrong guy.

01:58:06.036 --> 01:58:07.997
We got it narrowed down
to 1000 suspects.

01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:10.541
Sergeant White...

01:58:11.542 --> 01:58:13.168
...dispatch got a call for you.

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:16.463
Lieutenant Exley wants you
to meet him at the Victory Motel.

01:58:50.414 --> 01:58:51.999
You wanted to meet here?

01:58:54.084 --> 01:58:57.129
- You called it. I thought Hudgens was...
- Hudgens is dead.

01:59:08.557 --> 01:59:10.100
Let's get out of here.

01:59:17.524 --> 01:59:18.901
It's too late.

02:00:08.409 --> 02:00:10.494
You figured it was a set-up
but came anyway?

02:00:10.744 --> 02:00:12.746
A lot of bad stuff happened here.

02:00:13.289 --> 02:00:15.499
It's as good a place as any
for it to end.

02:00:25.801 --> 02:00:26.802
Clip.

02:00:31.974 --> 02:00:34.685
All I ever wanted
was to measure up to my father.

02:00:35.769 --> 02:00:36.687
Now's your chance.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.275
He died in the line of duty, didn't he?

02:02:40.936 --> 02:02:42.104
Goddamn it!

02:03:42.289 --> 02:03:42.998
You okay?

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:45.084
Yeah.

02:04:03.644 --> 02:04:05.646
Come on. Easy.

02:04:12.403 --> 02:04:13.279
Move!

02:04:36.051 --> 02:04:37.469
Rollo Tomasi.

02:04:40.931 --> 02:04:42.308
Who is he?

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:44.226
You are.

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:48.355
You're the guy who gets away with it.

02:04:52.484 --> 02:04:53.569
Jack knew it.

02:04:53.819 --> 02:04:55.070
And so do I.

02:05:20.846 --> 02:05:22.556
Are you going to shoot me...

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:24.850
...or arrest me?

02:05:31.273 --> 02:05:32.524
Good lad.

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:35.277
Always the politician.

02:05:35.903 --> 02:05:37.738
Let me do the talking.

02:05:38.364 --> 02:05:41.408
After I'm done, they'll make you
Chief of Detectives.

02:06:09.269 --> 02:06:10.980
Hold up your badge...

02:06:11.271 --> 02:06:13.190
...so they'll know you're a policeman.

02:07:03.741 --> 02:07:06.577
<i>You think you can talk</i>
<i>your way out of this, Lieutenant?</i>

02:07:09.204 --> 02:07:10.372
No...

02:07:10.623 --> 02:07:12.207
...but I can tell the truth.

02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:15.085
During our investigation...

02:07:16.211 --> 02:07:19.298
...of events surrounding
the Nite Owl case...

02:07:20.382 --> 02:07:23.802
...Jack Vincennes, Bud White
and I learned the following:

02:07:24.553 --> 02:07:27.014
Your golden boy's
throwing his whole life away.

02:07:27.264 --> 02:07:28.766
The 3 Nite Owl suspects...

02:07:29.725 --> 02:07:32.186
...while guilty of
kidnapping and rape...

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:35.981
...were innocent of the
multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.

02:07:37.358 --> 02:07:39.276
The gunmen were most likely...

02:07:39.526 --> 02:07:44.281
...Los Angeles police officers
Michael Breuning and William Carlisle...

02:07:44.531 --> 02:07:45.991
...and a third man...

02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:50.329
...who may or may not have been
Captain Dudley Smith.

02:07:51.413 --> 02:07:52.873
The objective:

02:07:53.832 --> 02:07:56.460
The elimination of
another police officer...

02:07:56.710 --> 02:07:58.504
...Richard Stensland...

02:07:59.421 --> 02:08:04.385
...who, along with former LAPD officer
Leland "Buzz" Meeks...

02:08:05.469 --> 02:08:09.139
...also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of Captain Smith...

02:08:09.848 --> 02:08:11.433
...and then betrayed him...

02:08:11.725 --> 02:08:13.936
...over 25 pounds of heroin...

02:08:15.062 --> 02:08:16.897
...the retrieval of which...

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:20.234
...was the ultimate motivation
behind the Nite Owl killings.

02:08:23.445 --> 02:08:26.699
Beginning with the incarceration
of Mickey Cohen...

02:08:27.116 --> 02:08:32.037
...Capt. Smith has been assuming control
of organized crime in Los Angeles.

02:08:33.914 --> 02:08:37.584
This includes the assassinations
of Mickey Cohen lieutenants...

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:41.380
...the systematic blackmail
of city officials...

02:08:43.007 --> 02:08:47.553
...and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens...

02:08:48.971 --> 02:08:51.056
...and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.

02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:57.146
Captain Smith admitted as much to me...

02:08:57.771 --> 02:08:59.690
...before I shot him...

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.859
...at the Victory Motel.

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:05.154
That's it.

02:09:10.117 --> 02:09:12.119
The press will have a field day.

02:09:13.746 --> 02:09:15.164
Christ!

02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:17.708
It'll stain the Department for years.

02:09:17.958 --> 02:09:18.834
Decades.

02:09:20.169 --> 02:09:22.713
If we can get the kid to play ball...

02:09:23.797 --> 02:09:25.591
...who's to say what happened?

02:09:26.717 --> 02:09:29.178
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:31.972
- Good idea.
- If we get the press to play.

02:09:39.855 --> 02:09:42.566
<i>Want to tell me what</i>
<i>you're smiling about?</i>

02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:49.281
A hero.

02:09:49.907 --> 02:09:51.575
How'd he know what we said?

02:09:51.825 --> 02:09:53.452
He couldn't have heard us.

02:09:57.289 --> 02:09:59.166
In this situation...

02:09:59.541 --> 02:10:01.460
...you'll need more than one.

02:10:08.425 --> 02:10:13.305
<i>It is my pleasure to present this award</i>
<i>to Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley...</i>

02:10:13.931 --> 02:10:15.975
<i>... two-time Medal of Valor recipient.</i>

02:10:26.193 --> 02:10:30.114
Next year the LAPD
will move into its new facility.

02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:32.199
With leaders like Edmund Exley...

02:10:32.449 --> 02:10:35.536
...the image of fat cops stealing apples
will be left behind...

02:10:35.786 --> 02:10:39.623
...and Los Angeles will finally
have the police force it deserves.

02:10:53.595 --> 02:10:55.681
You just couldn't resist.

02:10:55.973 --> 02:10:58.517
They're using me.
So for a while, I'm using them.

02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:01.645
Come on.

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:37.806
Thanks for the push.

02:11:59.662 --> 02:12:01.664
Congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.086
Some men get the world...

02:12:07.586 --> 02:12:11.173
...others get ex-hookers
and a trip to Arizona.
