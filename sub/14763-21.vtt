Honey, didn't you already
take a picture with
that troll?

00:21.022 --> 00:23.188
No, Mom. Not that troll.

What are they doing here?

00:53.053 --> 00:56.221
From these energy readings,
looks like a portal
to Nornheim opened up

00:56.223 --> 00:58.023
in the convention center.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.958
We can't have trolls
in here.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.528

02:28.481 --> 02:32.284
Good job. You showed
real teamwork out there.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.587
Uh, is he joking?
'Cause I can't tell.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.856
I never joke, ever.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.491
Yeah, we got that, Marsh.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.360
But you know what else
isn't a joke?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.996
What Red Hulk did
at the convention center.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.532
He's new to the team
and still figuring it out.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.600
It's called a learning curve.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.270
I got another word for it...
He's out of control.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.772
Someone'll get hurt.
He's not a team player.

02:53.774 --> 02:57.209
He's gonna do it again.

02:57.211 --> 03:00.012
I just do not like him.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.347
Enough. I don't
want to hear anymore.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.349
Unless you have
a better idea.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.051
We do.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.292
We want our Hulk back.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.793
(SIGHS) We've been
through all this.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.361
Why bring it up again?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.730
Because we need him.
Maybe not today.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.833
But a week from now,
or even tomorrow.
Who knows?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.369
And with that stupid collar
you made him put on,

03:24.371 --> 03:26.672
he's barely half as strong
as he was.

03:26.674 --> 03:29.374
He can't even turn
back into Dr. Banner.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.711
At least Red Hulk knows
how to follow orders.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.479
The rest of you better
fall in line

03:34.481 --> 03:36.315
and learn how
to follow orders too,

03:36.317 --> 03:38.984
or there will be consequences.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.086
Is that supposed
to be a threat?

03:41.088 --> 03:45.324
You know,
I'm beginning to think
I did make a mistake.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.192
About time
you admitted it.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.428
I should have made him
leave here a long time ago.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.330
He's too much
of a distraction.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.332
Hulk is not going anywhere.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.234
He's our friend.
We're a team.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.402
Out of the question.
He's staying.

I miss anything?

04:02.343 --> 04:05.344

on my face or something?

Guess not.

Hey, Greenie!
Just the one
I was looking for.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.852
Need you to take care
of something.

dripped a little oil.

after him later,

04:33.973 --> 04:37.109

on another mission
with that maniac...

We have to make
the best of it, Tony.

Except for that one tent
right over there.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.241
RED HULK: See
its concrete base
and those metal vent tubes?

05:09.243 --> 05:10.709
That's where
we need to go.

for him, fast.

to get us all taken out?

beat us down here.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.551
didn't want the guards

that it's best to
leave me alone

on one of my projects?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.427

you're stealing

are of a nature
none of you would understand.

get him to follow you
that way.

go into hiding.

He's been hitting
other facilities,
stealing more tech.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.853

his first mistake.
