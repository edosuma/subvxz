15:11.148 --> 15:12.982
but I'd still really like to
present these case files
for potential review.

15:13.118 --> 15:14.414
I think we rushed these cases.

15:14.550 --> 15:16.379
-We need to reopen them.
-Oh! Rushed?

15:16.514 --> 15:19.318
We got a backlog
six months deep,
and you want us to move slower?

15:19.454 --> 15:21.487
You need to focus your motion.

15:21.623 --> 15:24.021
Do the work,
close the case, move on.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.063
[sighs]

15:26.198 --> 15:28.160
You have
a lot of potential, Barry.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.035
You shouldn't still
be getting me coffee
after all these years.

15:31.171 --> 15:33.770
You're right. That's...
That's true.

15:33.906 --> 15:34.867
Go get me a coffee.

15:35.003 --> 15:36.636
[laughs]

15:38.177 --> 15:40.640
-Two sugars? Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.418
[knocking on door]

15:54.256 --> 15:56.054
You're gonna love this.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.589
I'm very satisfied
with the ruling
in the Johnson case.

15:57.725 --> 16:00.626
The evidence
our lab analyzed...

16:00.762 --> 16:03.931
was more than sufficient
to be conclusive.

16:04.066 --> 16:06.639
-I'm still working
that evidence.
-Because of the diligence

16:06.775 --> 16:08.801
and hard work and focus...

16:08.936 --> 16:11.369
Barry was still working
on that evidence. [laughs]

16:11.505 --> 16:12.970
Think if it were up to you

16:13.105 --> 16:14.943
that we'd still be scraping
Ted Bundy's molars.

16:15.078 --> 16:18.308
You know what? I'm so happy
you find this
all so hilarious,

16:18.444 --> 16:22.155
but we are dealing with
real people's lives,
people's families.

16:22.290 --> 16:24.385
And I don't think you can grasp
the gravity of that.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.123
So, why don't you
leave me alone?

16:26.259 --> 16:28.457
-[woman] Barry Allen?
-Iris West.

16:29.024 --> 16:30.123
You...

16:30.259 --> 16:32.422
know my full name also.

16:32.557 --> 16:34.290
Yes, from school.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.467
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us
you had a friend from school.

16:36.603 --> 16:38.335
-We actually didn't know
that Barry had a friend.
-Wow.

16:38.470 --> 16:40.166
[Albert] Yeah, what does that
make it now?

16:40.302 --> 16:41.235
-One?
-One.

16:41.370 --> 16:43.609
[laughs] You guys are so...

16:43.744 --> 16:45.637
Um, bye, you guys.

16:45.773 --> 16:47.105
Okay. Oh, my God.
That was just...

16:47.240 --> 16:48.775
Um...

16:48.911 --> 16:51.111
They're not really my friends.
They're my work friends.

16:51.246 --> 16:52.342
Do you work here?

16:52.477 --> 16:53.809
Yes, I do.

16:53.945 --> 16:55.684
God, it's been
a long time, huh?

16:55.820 --> 16:57.517
Hmm.

16:57.653 --> 16:59.990
I feel like
we saw each other...

17:00.125 --> 17:01.923
like a few years ago, right?

17:02.059 --> 17:03.424
No, because...

17:03.559 --> 17:05.793
we haven't
seen each other since...

17:05.929 --> 17:06.860
college.

17:06.996 --> 17:08.166
Ah.

17:08.301 --> 17:11.597
Maybe I was just
thinking about you.

17:11.733 --> 17:13.804
Well, I'm really glad
I ran into you.

17:13.940 --> 17:15.372
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:15.507 --> 17:17.609
Your father's appeal
is tomorrow, right?

17:17.744 --> 17:20.276
Yeah. How...

17:20.412 --> 17:21.946
Sorry, how do
you know about that?

17:22.082 --> 17:23.943
I'm covering it for the paper.

17:24.079 --> 17:24.849
Oh.

17:24.984 --> 17:26.614
How is he holding up?

17:27.786 --> 17:28.953
Um...

17:29.089 --> 17:30.550
Are you asking for the paper?

17:30.686 --> 17:32.820
-No, I'm asking as a friend.
-Oh.

17:32.956 --> 17:35.788
Although I'm sure the public
would want to know as well.

17:38.632 --> 17:40.124
Well...

17:40.259 --> 17:42.468
my only official comment
is that my dad is innocent.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.460
Right.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.396
I mean, no one...

17:45.531 --> 17:48.066
would want to believe
that their father
killed their mother.

17:48.202 --> 17:51.200
What do you mean, "believe"?
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.709
My mom should be alive.
It's not about what I believe.

17:53.845 --> 17:56.807
-It's about what the truth is.
-Right. No, yes, that's...

17:56.943 --> 17:58.448
Oh, my God.
That's what I meant.

17:58.982 --> 18:00.650
Right.

18:00.786 --> 18:02.617
Sorry, I have
no official comment
at this time.

18:42.055 --> 18:45.060

an old college friend...

18:45.195 --> 18:46.857
Iris West, today.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.968
Didn't you have
a monster crush on her?

18:49.103 --> 18:50.567
<i> Well, she have a boyfriend?</i>

18:50.702 --> 18:54.267
<i> -Why don't you ask her out?</i>
-Dad, I, um...

18:54.403 --> 18:58.308
I had a friend run
the old security camera

18:58.444 --> 19:00.913
through this new program
he's developed.

19:01.048 --> 19:03.374
And it's crystal clear now.

19:03.509 --> 19:04.514
It's just...

19:06.547 --> 19:07.616
you never look up, Dad.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.050
You can't see your face.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.530
No, uh-uh. You need to

your old man.

19:22.627 --> 19:24.627
<i> Do that, you might actually</i>
<i> have time for a girlfriend.</i>

19:24.763 --> 19:26.806
But Dad, I don't want...

19:26.942 --> 19:28.271
<i> We've done this before.</i>

19:28.406 --> 19:29.770
This was a last-ditch effort...

19:29.905 --> 19:32.570
and we'll go through
the motions tomorrow.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.837

19:34.972 --> 19:38.443
You know, sometimes I even
think it's probably easier
for me to be in here

19:38.578 --> 19:39.648

20:24.460 --> 20:26.689
This question is stupid.

20:26.824 --> 20:29.859
How many calculations
can you think of
with an answer of 24?

20:29.995 --> 20:31.500
There are a bajillion answers.

20:57.197 --> 20:59.725
Oh, Barry! Yeah, anything.

20:59.860 --> 21:01.796
I need another can of tomatoes.

21:02.829 --> 21:03.902
You have a can of tomatoes.

21:04.038 --> 21:05.570
I need another one.

21:05.705 --> 21:07.401
I thought you guys
went to the store this morning.

21:07.537 --> 21:09.408
But I forgot the tomatoes.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.168
This looks way more fun.

-Getting so big.

Yes, because, Barry,
if you were to go

27:35.527 --> 27:36.729
[Iris] Nice ride.

27:37.695 --> 27:39.628
You have fancy friends.

27:39.763 --> 27:41.261
Yeah, it was an Uber.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.826
Exec.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.833
Look, Iris, I really can't
talk about the case at all.

27:45.968 --> 27:48.235
I'm not here as a reporter.

27:49.804 --> 27:51.205
Can we talk?

27:56.443 --> 27:58.080
-Come on in.
-[chuckles awkwardly]

28:03.423 --> 28:06.482

than I expected.

-Yeah? Yeah, well, um...
-Yeah. [laughs]

28:37.257 --> 28:38.120
Thanks.

28:38.687 --> 28:39.682
Sure.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.558
Look, I feel really bad

28:43.694 --> 28:44.962
about earlier.

28:49.968 --> 28:52.971
I should've been
more sensitive.

28:53.107 --> 28:57.041
And, um, I probably
could've been less sensitive.

28:57.176 --> 28:59.569
I mean, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.375
It's like you lost
both parents in one day.

29:03.107 --> 29:04.582
I did.

29:04.717 --> 29:06.481
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

29:06.617 --> 29:09.547
and I lost my dad
to the failures
of the justice system.

29:09.682 --> 29:12.314
Is that why you got
into criminal forensics?

29:12.450 --> 29:13.683
To try and fix the system?

29:16.890 --> 29:18.494
Yeah.

29:18.629 --> 29:19.722
Yeah, to fix it.

29:21.628 --> 29:23.365
There's gotta be a way
to fix it, right?

29:23.500 --> 29:26.104
I mean, that's kinda why
I got into journalism, too.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.504
I could make it right
if I could just
go back somehow

29:28.639 --> 29:31.538
and warn them
without them knowing
that I'd warned them.

29:31.673 --> 29:33.873
I... thinking like that's
gonna... [chuckle softly]

29:34.009 --> 29:35.571
...drive you crazy.

29:35.706 --> 29:37.342
"If I could just
go back in time...

29:37.478 --> 29:39.285
and stop the guy
who did it." It's...

29:39.420 --> 29:41.044
No, I can't do that,
'cause that's
way too much interaction.

29:41.179 --> 29:42.019
[chuckles]

29:44.053 --> 29:45.451
My dad wasn't even at home.

29:45.586 --> 29:47.754
My mom sent him
to go get a can of tomatoes.

29:47.889 --> 29:50.095
I think whoever
broke into the house
thought it was empty.

29:50.231 --> 29:52.258
And then my mom was in there
with the knife in her hand

29:52.394 --> 29:54.365
and things went bad,
just this absurd

29:54.500 --> 29:56.534
chain of events.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.403
And it's like,
this footage should've finally
supported my dad's alibi.

29:59.539 --> 30:00.873
But instead...

30:01.008 --> 30:03.568
three lives ruined
for a can of tomatoes.

30:10.615 --> 30:11.543
Oh, my God.

30:12.176 --> 30:13.017
What?

30:14.445 --> 30:16.244
Well, that could be it.

30:16.380 --> 30:17.956
If my mom doesn't
forget the tomatoes
in the first place,

30:18.091 --> 30:20.253
then he never leaves
and she never dies.

30:20.388 --> 30:22.995

have to see me.

This is no interaction.

how was your day?

How was your month,
or your last 18 years?

35:24.724 --> 35:26.060
Or that's a weird question...

35:26.195 --> 35:27.595
'cause I was here.

35:27.731 --> 35:30.360
But obviously, we share
those memories together.

35:30.495 --> 35:32.195
Or I don't know,
maybe we could make
some new memories.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.065
Like we could
go to the aquarium,
or the circus,

35:34.200 --> 35:35.966
or to the park
and you could
push me on a swing.

35:36.102 --> 35:37.904
That's also weird
because I'm an adult now,

35:38.040 --> 35:40.102

on a swing.

-I'm actually gonna go.
-What do you mean?

39:45.917 --> 39:47.619
Enjoy your life. Do you.

39:47.755 --> 39:49.786
Change literally nothing.

39:49.921 --> 39:52.122
-Um, I'll see you again never.
-I have a few more
questions, though.

39:52.258 --> 39:54.064
We have so much
to learn from each other.

39:54.199 --> 39:55.394
[thunder rumbles]

39:55.529 --> 39:56.495
Oh, great.

39:56.631 --> 39:57.964
Well, you're leaving me.

39:58.099 --> 39:59.999
And now the storm's
gonna ruin my date.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.166
What day is it today?

40:03.537 --> 40:05.939
Uh... Uh...

40:06.770 --> 40:07.879
Sunday?

40:08.015 --> 40:08.975
No, the date.

40:11.118 --> 40:12.517
It's September 29th.

40:13.546 --> 40:14.519
Shit.

40:15.519 --> 40:18.148
This storm, this is the day.

40:18.283 --> 40:20.587
-What day?
-The day I got my powers.

40:20.722 --> 40:22.890
The day you get your powers.

40:24.197 --> 40:25.563
-Powers?
-Listen...

40:25.698 --> 40:27.365
I can't tell you why
I traveled back in time,

40:27.501 --> 40:29.996
and I can't tell you
what I changed.

40:30.132 --> 40:32.593
But, essentially,
in my version of reality,

40:32.729 --> 40:34.738
I ended up interning
at the Central City Crime Lab

40:34.874 --> 40:37.436
in my freshman year,
and that's where it happened.

40:37.572 --> 40:39.372
Well, happens.

40:39.507 --> 40:42.003
Tonight, September 29,
the accident
that gives me my powers.

40:42.139 --> 40:43.746
And if you're not there...

40:44.743 --> 40:45.748
in 30 minutes...

40:47.420 --> 40:48.784
then you won't get the powers.

40:48.919 --> 40:51.622
Which means
I don't get the powers, maybe?

40:51.758 --> 40:54.691
And then, that would mean
that I lose my way

40:54.826 --> 40:56.694
of getting back in time
in the first place,

40:56.829 --> 40:58.860
and then I literally
have no idea what happens.

40:59.658 --> 41:00.757

our date tonight?

41:06.406 --> 41:09.130
She might be our future wife.

41:09.266 --> 41:12.034
There might not be a future...

41:12.169 --> 41:13.879

This is where I was sitting.

42:38.127 --> 42:40.295
And actually,
let me take this for you.

42:40.430 --> 42:41.665
Thank you.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.932
Okay, I had just
opened those windows...

42:45.833 --> 42:47.771
to clear out the fumes.

42:48.835 --> 42:49.902
Right around now.

42:50.038 --> 42:51.874

in that chair,

42:52.009 --> 42:53.709
and I was right under
this shelf of chemicals.

42:53.845 --> 42:55.738

the lightning hits.

hits the chemicals...

electrocutes you.
-Okay,

electrocuted, though.
-Sit down.

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:37.377
Now...

01:24:38.309 --> 01:24:39.511
we try not to die.

01:24:41.978 --> 01:24:44.384

[grunting]

01:25:39.369 --> 01:25:42.002
[past Barry]
Oh, you guys should've
seen that in slo-mo.

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:47.447
[dramatic music builds]

01:25:53.951 --> 01:25:56.786
-[pensive music playing]
-[water dripping]

01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:22.016
[Barry] Yeah, I'm just
realizing that I didn't really
think this through.

01:26:22.152 --> 01:26:23.648
There are good Kryptonians...

01:26:23.783 --> 01:26:26.088
and then there are very,
very bad Kryptonians.

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:27.618
[whispering]
And I was very confident

01:26:27.754 --> 01:26:29.154
that we were just
gonna find Superman,

01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:31.160
and if we found Superman,

01:26:31.295 --> 01:26:32.952
then this would all be
super simple.

01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:34.989
-[woman] Who are you?
-Holy Funyuns.

01:26:36.799 --> 01:26:37.824
Hi.

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:40.100
-I... I'm Barry.
-We're Barry.

01:26:40.236 --> 01:26:42.761
We were trying to find Kal-El.

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:44.863
But we found you instead.

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:46.436
What do you want with Kal-El?

01:26:46.572 --> 01:26:48.004
We were trying to rescue him.

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.844
Why?

01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:52.672
Because he's my friend.

01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:54.106
Do you... Do you know him?

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:56.280
[whispering]
She looks mad. Get ready.

01:26:56.415 --> 01:26:58.643
She might do laser vision,
or she might do, like,
a freezy breath...

01:26:58.779 --> 01:27:01.323
-or she'll just start
throwing crazy...
-My name is Kara.

01:27:02.355 --> 01:27:03.589
Daughter of Zor-El.

01:27:04.489 --> 01:27:05.987
Kal-El was my cousin.

01:27:06.122 --> 01:27:08.354
-Right, and who's Kal-El again?
-It's Superman.

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:11.063
-No, 'cause you said
that was Clark.
-Who's Clark?

01:27:11.199 --> 01:27:14.295
Clark is his human name.

01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:15.463
Clark.

01:27:15.599 --> 01:27:17.603
[soft music playing]

01:27:18.637 --> 01:27:20.507
He was an infant when we left.

01:27:21.871 --> 01:27:23.510
The last son of Krypton... I...

01:27:25.511 --> 01:27:26.876
I was sent to protect him.

01:27:27.011 --> 01:27:28.883
It looks like
he never made it to Earth

01:27:29.018 --> 01:27:30.879
in this universe.

01:27:31.014 --> 01:27:33.318
Our pods,
they must have separated.

01:27:33.453 --> 01:27:35.015
Wait, so you thought a baby

01:27:35.151 --> 01:27:37.518
was gonna protect us
from this Zod guy?

01:27:37.654 --> 01:27:39.084
General Zod is here.

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.329
He must have tracked
my pod's signal.

01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:43.655
-I have to go. [groans]
-Whoa, whoa, wait.

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:47.330
Well, you need to
recover your strength.
Actually, Barry...

01:27:47.466 --> 01:27:48.870
take her to the roof

01:27:49.006 --> 01:27:50.903
and put her in the sun.

01:27:51.038 --> 01:27:52.240
Yeah.

01:27:52.375 --> 01:27:54.239
-Yeah.
-Whatever, like if, I mean,

01:27:54.374 --> 01:27:55.838
you're solar powered.

01:27:55.973 --> 01:27:57.408
Good for you.
I've been trying to...

01:27:57.544 --> 01:27:58.974
-[Kara panting]
-Oh, uh...

01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:02.347
We'll take that with us.

01:28:02.482 --> 01:28:04.485
[enthralling music playing]

01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:14.059
Um, am I cool to...

01:28:14.194 --> 01:28:15.056
turn around?

01:28:16.196 --> 01:28:17.425
Are you dressed

01:28:17.561 --> 01:28:19.593
in a red cape?

01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:21.832
[breathing heavily]

01:28:26.273 --> 01:28:28.307
You're levitating?

01:28:28.443 --> 01:28:30.410
[indistinct voices whispering]

-[noises stop]
-[groans softly]

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:37.210
Is it always this loud?

01:28:38.921 --> 01:28:40.085
[sighs]

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.983
Is it loud?

01:28:42.118 --> 01:28:45.322
Are you, uh, good?
Do you feel, um...

01:28:45.457 --> 01:28:46.692
strong yet, or...

01:28:47.624 --> 01:28:49.326
[hawks, spits]

01:28:49.461 --> 01:28:50.289
[past Barry gasps]

01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:53.958
Yep, that seems, uh,

01:28:54.094 --> 01:28:55.762
seems strong. You know...

01:28:55.898 --> 01:28:58.439
old man Barry, down there,

01:28:58.574 --> 01:29:00.736
says if we don't stop
Captain Zode,

01:29:00.871 --> 01:29:03.109
he'll kill thousands of people.

01:29:03.245 --> 01:29:04.637
Billions of people.

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:05.876
Billions?

01:29:07.478 --> 01:29:08.746
Of your people.

01:29:08.881 --> 01:29:10.584
-They're good people.
-Good people?

01:29:11.748 --> 01:29:13.321
We came to this planet

01:29:13.457 --> 01:29:15.353
looking for
a safe place to live,

01:29:15.489 --> 01:29:17.622
and they put me in a cage.

01:29:17.758 --> 01:29:20.321
Yeah. A lot of humans
are dicks.

01:29:20.457 --> 01:29:22.691
But then

01:29:22.827 --> 01:29:25.100
there's babies and ballerinas.

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:26.928
And entertainment wrestlers.

01:29:27.063 --> 01:29:28.503
A lot of humans
are worth saving.

01:29:29.633 --> 01:29:30.835
Maybe to you.

01:29:32.241 --> 01:29:33.574
But I'm not a human.

01:29:35.001 --> 01:29:36.302
I'm a Kryptonian.

01:29:40.016 --> 01:29:41.677
She's gone.

01:29:41.813 --> 01:29:43.518
I have to get my powers back.

01:29:46.323 --> 01:29:47.550
If I can re-create the accident

01:29:47.686 --> 01:29:49.117
that gave me my powers...

01:29:49.253 --> 01:29:50.624
maybe I can reconnect
to the Speed Force...

01:29:50.759 --> 01:29:53.459
and maybe we'd stand a chance
against Zod.

01:29:53.595 --> 01:29:55.992
Or kill yourself
in the process.

01:29:58.992 --> 01:29:59.831
Tell me something.

01:30:01.766 --> 01:30:03.796
If you get your powers back,

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:05.130
you can go anywhere.

01:30:05.265 --> 01:30:06.700
You can go to another timeline,

01:30:06.835 --> 01:30:08.174
another universe.

01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:10.376
Why do you wanna stay...

01:30:10.511 --> 01:30:12.713
and fight to save this one?

01:30:12.848 --> 01:30:15.176
Because this is the world
where my mom lives.

01:30:18.456 --> 01:30:21.046
I went back in time
to save her.

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:23.224
I'm not gonna lose her again.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.153
The kid doesn't know, does he?

01:30:25.288 --> 01:30:27.991
How do you tell someone
something like that?

01:30:31.531 --> 01:30:33.535
I lost my parents...

01:30:36.501 --> 01:30:38.133
but that pain...

01:30:41.804 --> 01:30:43.337
made me who I am.

01:30:43.473 --> 01:30:45.838
I'm not sure I know who I am
without it, actually.

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:47.978
[wistful music playing]

01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:52.882
I spent a lifetime...

01:30:53.018 --> 01:30:55.854
trying to right
the wrongs of the past.

01:30:57.224 --> 01:30:58.393
As if

01:30:58.529 --> 01:31:01.262
putting on a cape
and fighting crime

01:31:01.397 --> 01:31:03.224
would bring my parents back.

01:31:09.173 --> 01:31:10.506
You actually did it.

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:13.371
So...

01:31:13.507 --> 01:31:14.773
I guess the plan is

01:31:14.909 --> 01:31:17.135
to douse yourself
in industrial chemicals

01:31:17.271 --> 01:31:19.044
while electrocuting yourself?

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.010
Yep.

01:31:24.252 --> 01:31:25.417
Want some help?

[rousing music plays]

01:31:27.386 --> 01:31:29.657
[Barry] Hell yeah.
That would be
incredibly useful.

01:31:29.792 --> 01:31:31.323
I've actually already
borrowed some chemicals

01:31:31.459 --> 01:31:32.592
and your soldering iron,

01:31:32.727 --> 01:31:34.788
and I'm sitting
in your bat-seat.

01:31:34.924 --> 01:31:36.356
Is that like a faux pas?

Okay, when I throw the switch,

01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:16.060
the current should
run up the wire

for me to not be protected.
