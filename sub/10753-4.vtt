00:19.936 --> 00:23.133
He's doing it again.
Must this dog stare at me all the time?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.635
I don't know. Eddie, must you?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.700
He must.

00:29.946 --> 00:33.097
What is so fascinating about me?

00:35.118 --> 00:39.236
Is my head a large piece of kibble?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.776
Am I some sort of canine enigma?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.000
Think about it. Get back to me.

00:46.254 --> 00:50.406
Gents, dinner's up.
Can I help you clear your papers?

00:50.759 --> 00:53.193
No, I need these in order.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.028
What is it?

00:55.263 --> 00:59.051
An old case from the police force,
the weeping lotus murder.

00:59.392 --> 01:04.022
You're still trotting this out? He's been
trying to solve this case for 20 years.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.388
And I'm not stopping till I do.

01:06.649 --> 01:11.279
Cops have an instinct.
Mine tells me this case can be cracked.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.885
There must be one small thing
I keep overlooking.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.636
There is, who the murderer was.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.272
(Doorbell)

01:20.497 --> 01:22.488
It's nice you're still so dedicated.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.741
It's a hobby. Some guys build boats.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.877
I figure out why a maniac kills a hooker

01:29.172 --> 01:31.083
and stuffs her into a bowling bag.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.979
It's relaxing.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.877
- Hello, Niles.
- Sorry I'm late.

01:37.138 --> 01:40.050
Maris had a run-in with a rude
Directory Assistance operator.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.306
It shattered her calm.

01:42.560 --> 01:47.395
Seems Maris is a bit high-strung.
Maybe she should see someone.

01:47.774 --> 01:52.006
She's seen everyone. Why do you think
she was calling Directory Assistance?

01:52.362 --> 01:53.477
Evening, Dr Crane.

01:53.697 --> 01:57.485
Hello, Daphne. Good to see you.
An enchanting scent you're wearing.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.704
Must be the ranch dressing.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.791
- Won't Mrs Crane be coming?
- I'm afraid not.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.643
And no more of this
"Dr and Mrs Crane" formality.

02:07.919 --> 02:11.355
To you, it's Niles and... uh...

02:11.673 --> 02:13.391
- Maris.
- Yes, Maris.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.863
- Glad you could join us, Niles.
- I wouldn't have missed it.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.741
Well, the food's ready. Let's start.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.213
- Well, enjoy.
- Where are you going?

02:25.478 --> 02:28.788
- In the kitchen.
- Don't be ridiculous.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.621
You can't eat by yourself in the kitchen.
I'll join you.

02:33.903 --> 02:38.021
We're all eating right here,
like a family. End of discussion.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.324
Well, isn't this nice?
Feels just like home.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.814
- I'm famished.
- Me too.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.230
You boys still say a prayer
before you eat?

02:46.499 --> 02:51.209
- Oh, almost without exception.
- Yes, yes.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.421
We thank you, Lord,
for the food we're about to eat.

02:54.716 --> 02:59.028
You've blessed our table
with Your bounty.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.696
Thank You, Lord,
for bringing this family together.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.932
We also thank You for Your other gifts.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.299
May we always remember to share
with those less fortunate.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.074
- Stop staring!
- I wasn't staring.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.424
Amen.

03:26.331 --> 03:30.290
Frasier, did you read Derek Mann's
column? You were mentioned.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.777
- No.
- It wasn't flattering.

03:33.046 --> 03:38.678
- Still, I'd like to have seen it.
- Why didn't you say so?

03:39.094 --> 03:40.891
Who's Derek Mann?

03:41.137 --> 03:45.176
He writes that "Mann About Town"
column. The things he says!

03:45.517 --> 03:47.712
Sometimes, he's really funny.
What did he say?

03:47.977 --> 03:50.047
"l hate Frasier Crane."

03:53.149 --> 03:57.347
- Oh, sorry.
- That's it? "l hate Frasier Crane"?

03:57.696 --> 03:59.766
Don't let it bother you.

04:00.031 --> 04:04.627
It doesn't. I knew when I chose
this career, I'd be open to criticism.

04:04.994 --> 04:09.226
It's the price I pay for celebrity.
But thank you for bringing the paper.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.779
And for highlighting it in yellow.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.362
- Who'd like some wine?
- I would.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.670
Daphne, the salad is exquisite.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.886
- Why would he say that?
- Must be the carrots.

04:25.181 --> 04:30.130
Not the salad. Derek Mann.
Why would he write that?

04:30.520 --> 04:35.548
This attack is totally unwarranted.
I'm a healer, for God's sake.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.571
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- I've every right to be upset.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.453
I won't enjoy my dinner
until this is in the trash.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.855
- I wanted to save an article.
- On what?

04:47.996 --> 04:51.591
- Nothing.
- Come on, I'm interested. Tell me.

04:51.916 --> 04:56.865
It was about Margaret Thatcher's
secret for growing zinnias. Happy?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.808
Not really.

05:05.388 --> 05:10.416
OK, Lorraine, calm down and listen
to what I say. Will you do that?

05:10.810 --> 05:13.370
- 'OK.'
- Good girl. Your problem...

05:13.646 --> 05:15.602
(Telephone clicks)

05:15.857 --> 05:20.009
'Oh, gosh. That's call waiting.
Do you mind if I take it?'

05:20.362 --> 05:22.273
Go ahead.

05:22.530 --> 05:27.206
It's certainly an interesting situation
she's in. Don't you think so, Roz?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.060
Yes.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.017
'OK, I'm back.'

05:36.252 --> 05:39.961
All right. Listen carefully to what I say.
Your problem...

05:40.298 --> 05:41.731
(Click)

05:41.966 --> 05:43.922
'Sorry. I'll be right back.'

05:45.720 --> 05:49.952
For someone with so many problems,
she certainly is popular.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.516
'OK. Go ahead, Dr Crane.'

05:54.771 --> 05:55.726
(Click)

05:55.939 --> 05:57.930
'l don't believe it, another call!'

05:58.191 --> 06:01.501
Hold it, you want to take that call
for the same reason

06:01.820 --> 06:04.857
you want to change your career
and leave your boyfriend.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.114
You're obsessed
with what you think you're missing,

06:08.410 --> 06:11.163
the "call on the other line".

06:11.454 --> 06:14.571
You've got to take one call
at a time from now on.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.832
Fully explore each one in turn,

06:18.128 --> 06:22.007
and you'll be a stronger person for it.
Do you follow me?

06:22.340 --> 06:25.013
'OK, I'm back!'

06:31.850 --> 06:34.159
Thank you for your call.

06:35.854 --> 06:41.451
Only a few minutes left.
I'd like to end on a personal note.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.816
As some of you may know, yesterday,

06:44.070 --> 06:47.506
I was mentioned
in Derek Mann's column.

06:47.824 --> 06:52.614
He said, and I quote,
"l hate Frasier Crane."

06:55.081 --> 06:58.596
"l HATE Frasier Crane."

07:00.712 --> 07:04.990
What trenchant criticism (!)
Move aside, Voltaire (!)

07:05.342 --> 07:07.617
Step back into the shadows,
HL Mencken,

07:07.886 --> 07:10.195
there's a new kid in town.

07:11.556 --> 07:15.754
One can only wonder how many hours
Derek Mann sat in the glow

07:16.102 --> 07:20.141
of his computer screen before
his trembling fingers sprang to life

07:20.482 --> 07:23.440
and pecked out this chef d'Å“uvre,

07:23.735 --> 07:27.284
"l hate Frasier Crane."

07:27.614 --> 07:30.412
A lesser critic
would have wasted our time

07:30.700 --> 07:33.976
by presenting a well-thought out,
point-by-point,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.596
constructive critique of this show.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.467
But, no, not our Mr Mann.

07:39.751 --> 07:43.903
So, dear listeners, when Mr Mann's
column arrives on your doorstep,

07:44.255 --> 07:47.804
read it, enjoy it,
and above all, treasure it.

07:48.134 --> 07:53.447
For, one day this man will join
the pantheon of the immortals.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.124
And, if we're lucky,
it'll be one day soon.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.768
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.291
- Funny running into you here.
- I'm always here.

08:12.575 --> 08:16.329
- Have you seen today's 'Times'?
- No.

08:16.663 --> 08:21.453
Lucky for you, I saved it.
Look at Derek Mann's column.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.510
This is the second time in two days
you've given me a paper.

08:25.839 --> 08:30.276
Have you ever considered
getting yourself a route?

08:30.635 --> 08:35.106
- Hello. I don't think we've met.
- We have, a few times, Roz Doyle.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.941
Oh, of course. It was at the, uh...

08:38.226 --> 08:40.534
It was during the, uh...

08:40.812 --> 08:45.169
Well, I'm too successful
to feel awkward. Where did we meet?

08:47.736 --> 08:51.092
- The radio station.
- Nice to see you again.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.840
Apparently,
Mr Mann heard your programme.

08:54.117 --> 08:58.713
So I see. "Yesterday,
Dr Frasier Crane got on my case

08:59.080 --> 09:02.436
"for not giving a point-by-point
criticism of his radio show.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.946
"Well, he asked for it..."

09:05.211 --> 09:09.250
- His entire column is about your show.
- Not very flattering, either.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.788
He even attacks your
"dim-witted sidekick call screener".

09:13.094 --> 09:14.322
That's me!

09:14.554 --> 09:17.671
Oh, now I remember you.

09:19.267 --> 09:23.146
"It's hard to say what
to hate most about Crane's show,

09:23.480 --> 09:28.713
"his pompous, sanctimonious style,
his self-congratulatory references,

09:29.110 --> 09:33.661
"or his voice, a mock sympathetic tone
so sickly sweet,

09:34.032 --> 09:36.592
"one wonders if he graduated
from medical school

09:36.868 --> 09:38.984
"or from some mind-controlling cult."

09:40.413 --> 09:43.291
- It's continued on 12.
- I've read enough!

09:43.583 --> 09:46.859
- Can I get you anything?
- How could he say something like that?

09:47.170 --> 09:52.847
- It's my job. I'm a waiter.
- We don't want anything, thank you.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.978
In a few days, it'll blow over.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.014
You're right.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.667
To retaliate
would be to stoop to his level.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.889
The best response
is no response at all.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.499
(Shouts) Pompous
and sanctimonious, am l?

10:09.818 --> 10:12.696
Mann can't even write
grammatical sentences.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.343
Every five words there's
one of his precious dot-dot-dots.

10:16.658 --> 10:20.970
He must like making dots with
the crayon he writes this drivel with!

10:22.205 --> 10:28.360
Dr Crane, we have Stewart who has
a problem with delayed gratification.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.071
Well, he's just gonna have to wait!

10:32.382 --> 10:35.454
I don't know who
Derek Mann thinks he is,

10:35.760 --> 10:40.595
but if he thinks he can hide behind his
paper like a school child behind a tree,

10:40.974 --> 10:43.442
I say, let's expose
this Derek Mann for what he is,

10:43.727 --> 10:46.036
not a man at all, but half a man.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.509
- What line is Stewart on?
- He hung up.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.252
I'm leaving all sorts of bodies
in my wake today.

10:53.570 --> 10:59.406
Let's see who's on line five. Hello,
this is Dr Frasier Crane. I'm listening.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.102
- 'Good, 'cos I was listening, too.'
- And you are?

11:03.413 --> 11:05.369
'Derek Mann.'

11:05.623 --> 11:07.375
I see.

11:08.376 --> 11:13.086
'Look, nobody calls me half a man,
especially some Ivy League twit.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.457
'So what do you say
we settle this...like men?'

11:16.760 --> 11:19.228
Are you implying you want to fight me?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.264
'No, I'm saying it.'

11:21.514 --> 11:23.584
Fight as in a fist fight?

11:23.850 --> 11:27.604
'No, I thought
we'd throw pies at each other (!)

11:27.937 --> 11:31.293
'So are you up to it,
or aren't YOU man enough?'

11:38.156 --> 11:41.512
We'll be back after these messages.

11:43.912 --> 11:48.622
We're back.
We have a surprise caller, Derek Mann.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.719
'What's it gonna be?
You gonna fight me or not?'

11:52.003 --> 11:55.837
- You can't be serious.
- 'Just as I figured. You're chicken.'

11:56.174 --> 11:58.404
No, I don't think civilized people
behave that way.

11:58.677 --> 12:02.875
Maybe our listeners have an opinion.
Who's on the line?

12:03.223 --> 12:07.102
Lines one to eight are people
who think you're chicken.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.459
- 'You're chicken, Crane. Admit it.'
- I'm not chicken!

12:11.773 --> 12:13.001
(Clucks)

12:13.233 --> 12:15.428
We are mature,
thinking people, not cavemen.

12:15.694 --> 12:16.888
(Clucks)

12:17.112 --> 12:21.071
You want a fight so bad,
name the time and place.

12:21.408 --> 12:25.242
'Kinsley Square, outside your office,
by the old statue, noon tomorrow.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.933
'Don't back out.'

12:28.206 --> 12:30.162
I won't.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.649
Don't you back out, either, because
I know where your office is, too,

12:35.005 --> 12:38.202
and I know where you live,
and I'll track you down!

12:40.677 --> 12:44.636
Who else wants a piece of me?

12:46.516 --> 12:48.632
Having a look
at that murder case again?

12:48.893 --> 12:51.202
Yeah, I dug out
the old crime scene photos.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.232
Don't be a greedy guts.
Let's have a look.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.615
Her name was Helen.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.980
Yeah, it was.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.999
You must have seen that
on some of my papers.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.010
No, I just got this feeling
when I touched the picture.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.684
- You're putting me on.
- She had a lot of men in her life.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.156
No kidding. She was a hooker.

13:20.425 --> 13:24.100
No, I mean she had four brothers.

13:24.429 --> 13:28.741
That's amazing.
She did have four brothers.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.202
What else are you getting?

13:32.479 --> 13:33.798
Tell me more.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.253
I can't just turn it on
and off like a faucet.

13:37.567 --> 13:41.958
Give it a try, please.
What else are you getting?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.392
Nothing... No, wait.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.653
- I see a man.
- Yeah?

13:47.911 --> 13:51.824
A well-dressed man. He's wearing
wing tips and a trench coat.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.280
Yeah, yeah.

13:53.500 --> 13:58.528
He's getting off an elevator.
He's walking down a long hallway.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.994
She doesn't know he's coming.
He's opening the door.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.052
Hello, everyone.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.206
Sometimes I get me signals crossed.

14:12.060 --> 14:16.656
- What's going on?
- Unless you killed a hooker, not much.

14:18.441 --> 14:22.673
We heard your show. I loved the way
you handled that Derek Mann.

14:23.029 --> 14:28.467
Especially when he challenged you
to a fight and you stood up to him.

14:28.868 --> 14:33.862
- Yes, I did, didn't l?
- Boy, I can't wait to see that.

14:34.249 --> 14:37.764
I'm not actually
gonna go through with it, Dad.

14:38.086 --> 14:42.682
- What are you talking about?
- I already won our little war of words.

14:43.049 --> 14:46.405
How would I benefit
by having a fist fight?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.632
Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.889
He challenged you,
and you're backing down?

14:53.184 --> 14:58.099
Mature people should use their
intellect to settle differences.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.473
A man doesn't just turn and run.

15:01.776 --> 15:05.291
- Are you encouraging me to fight?
- You gave him your word.

15:05.613 --> 15:09.288
I didn't know what I was saying.
I hadn't had lunch.

15:09.617 --> 15:13.929
I might've known this would happen.
It's Billy Kriezel all over again.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.166
What did you say?

15:16.416 --> 15:19.806
Something about a Billy Kriezel.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.925
That was 30 years ago.

15:22.172 --> 15:25.209
- Who's Billy Kriezel?
- A kid who tormented me.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.658
So Frasier made fun of Billy's crew cut.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.317
He started it. He made fun
of the elbow patches on my blazer.

15:34.309 --> 15:37.107
They were supposed to fight

15:37.395 --> 15:39.955
after school
only "Patches" didn't show up.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.586
I had a clarinet lesson!

15:42.859 --> 15:47.011
You don't need to remind me.
Billy's dad was a cop, too.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.878
The guys rode me about that for years.

15:50.158 --> 15:54.310
Every time I couldn't make it for a drink,
they'd say, "Got a clarinet lesson?"

15:54.663 --> 15:58.258
Couldn't you have met Billy
after the clarinet lesson?

15:58.583 --> 16:01.973
Daphne, could you excuse us
for a moment?

16:02.295 --> 16:06.652
Of course. I have a feeling I'm going
to be excused a lot in this house.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.878
I am sorry if I embarrassed you

16:13.181 --> 16:15.979
for not fighting
Billy Kriezel 30 years ago.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.986
The situation is not the same now.

16:19.270 --> 16:22.421
I'm adult, I've been to med school,
I have a position in this city.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.611
- I don't resort to brawling.
- You accepted the man's challenge.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.413
You won't be happy until
I have a black eye.

16:29.698 --> 16:32.610
I just want you to do
what you said you'd do.

16:32.909 --> 16:38.347
You can talk about your medical school,
your intellect, your place in this city...

16:38.748 --> 16:43.503
But you know what?
It's all one big clarinet lesson.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.835
I can't even look at you.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.193
So I step out of the shower,
I look out the window,

17:02.522 --> 17:05.036
and I notice
the garbage man looking at me.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.830
I say, "Did you get a good look?"
He says, "No. Turn around."

17:10.989 --> 17:15.665
He smiles, and he's missing a tooth.
That's when the romance went out of it.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.607
Why are you telling me this?

17:19.873 --> 17:22.944
To get your mind off the fact
that in five minutes

17:23.251 --> 17:25.890
you're going to get your clock cleaned.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.208
Did it occur to you that I might win?

17:29.507 --> 17:31.338
Your shoe's untied.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.549
If you fell for that one,
you're going down,

17:33.803 --> 17:35.839
and you're going down hard.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.466
Frasier,
there's quite a crowd out there.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.639
Secretaries with bag lunches,
children with balloons.

17:43.938 --> 17:47.613
- All that's missing is a mariachi band.
- They're setting up.

17:47.942 --> 17:51.651
I'd better go find a place in the crowd.

17:51.988 --> 17:56.857
I'll be off to the left if you tear
his ear off and want to throw it to me.

17:57.243 --> 18:02.761
As your brother and as your friend,
why are you doing this?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.918
- It's Billy Kriezel.
- Where?

18:13.885 --> 18:15.841
He's not here, Niles.

18:16.096 --> 18:20.214
- I ran away from him when I was ten.
- I remember.

18:20.558 --> 18:24.392
You know,
and I've been running ever since.

18:25.855 --> 18:30.292
Well, this is where it stops.
I'm not running any more.

18:30.652 --> 18:35.009
What is it that makes
us Crane boys such targets?

18:38.618 --> 18:41.212
Chalk it up to random violence.

18:46.042 --> 18:51.116
- Hey, there.
- Dad, what are you doing here?

18:51.506 --> 18:54.418
I said some things
that went over the line.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.790
Dad, if you're worried that
you talked me into something

18:58.096 --> 19:01.054
that I wasn't ready to do,
you're wrong.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.658
I... I'm doing this for myself.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.368
Good.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.640
Who told you that
I was going through with it?

19:08.940 --> 19:12.455
Let's just say a father knows
certain things about his son.

19:14.779 --> 19:18.897
Good news. I parked on
a broken meter. We're getting a freebie.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.802
Good luck with the fight.

19:22.078 --> 19:26.117
Thank you, Daphne.
Any psychic predictions?

19:26.458 --> 19:31.009
Actually, yes, but don't worry.
I'm frequently wrong.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.312
Frasier, there's something
I want you to see.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.734
There, the man standing
to the left of the statue.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.616
I recognize him from the paper.
That's Derek Mann.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.803
He's gigantic.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.846
My God, you could show a movie
on his back.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.085
Sure you wanna go through with it?

19:55.362 --> 19:57.512
- Yes... Yes, I am.
- Good.

19:57.781 --> 20:01.410
You'll be fine.
Remember, this is a street fight,

20:01.743 --> 20:04.211
so fight dirty and throw the first punch.

20:04.496 --> 20:07.294
I find that a knee to the groin
does the trick.

20:07.582 --> 20:12.292
Any doubts, check with a fellow
in Manchester named Nigel Tavers.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.231
If we want an unobstructed view...

20:16.508 --> 20:18.738
I prefer if you guys stay here.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.568
Whatever you want.

20:22.639 --> 20:27.030
- Well, wish me luck.
- Go, champ. That a boy.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.519
(Mariachi band strikes up)

20:33.316 --> 20:35.272
They got a band out there.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.883
I have to get their card. I need
someone for our summer barbecue.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.791
Look, they're starting to fight.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.031
They're just sizing each other up.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.845
Come on, Frasier, hit him first!

20:47.122 --> 20:48.350
(Siren)

20:48.581 --> 20:51.220
- Is that the police?
- What are they doing here?

20:51.501 --> 20:53.810
They're breaking it up.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.052
(Crowd jeers)

20:58.717 --> 21:01.675
OK, I'm coming peacefully.
Let me get my jacket.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.642
I'm not arresting you.

21:03.888 --> 21:08.439
But I warn you, in this town, we don't
settle our differences with street fights.

21:08.810 --> 21:13.679
- You'll have no more trouble from me.
- OK.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.490
Dad, did you see me?
My hands are trembling.

21:18.820 --> 21:22.813
My chest is pounding,
my knees are like jelly. I feel great!

21:23.158 --> 21:25.308
You did good.

21:25.577 --> 21:29.172
I was out there. I was ready.
You saw that, right?

21:29.497 --> 21:32.694
- You would have kicked his butt.
- From here to Tacoma.

21:33.001 --> 21:36.437
I say we celebrate.
A round of victory lattes on me.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.825
(Cheering)

21:42.719 --> 21:44.675
Thanks, Harry. I owe you one.

21:44.929 --> 21:48.365
You cut it close,
Frasier was almost eating sidewalk.

21:48.683 --> 21:52.801
- I'm missing lunch for this.
- You could stand to miss a few.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.343
Some of the guys are having a beer.
Why don't you come?

21:56.649 --> 21:59.527
Maybe I will. You know why I will?

21:59.819 --> 22:03.289
'Cos the Crane boys don't take
clarinet lessons any more.

22:03.615 --> 22:05.685
What are you talking about?

22:05.950 --> 22:08.145
Oh, that's right.
You weren't in my precinct.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.710
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling

22:15.960 --> 22:18.520
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.422 --> 22:20.855
# Oh, my!

22:21.091 --> 22:22.809
# And maybe I seem a bit confused

22:23.051 --> 22:26.123
# Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:27.972 --> 22:29.690
# But I don't know what to do with

22:29.933 --> 22:32.606
# Those tossed salads
and scrambled eggs

22:34.062 --> 22:36.098
# They're calling again #

22:36.356 --> 22:37.311
Thank you!
