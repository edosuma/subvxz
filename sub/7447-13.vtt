WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.128
Â£100.

00:03.280 --> 00:05.123
Who do you want shot?

00:05.280 --> 00:06.884
Big Jim Devine.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.089
I wanna get her
right where she breathes.

00:11.080 --> 00:14.846
Jim and I are married... for life.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.686
You'll never know what that is.
You'll die alone.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.683
And you'll die sooner than you think.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.291
For a decade,
Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh

02:33.440 --> 02:36.364
had battled it out to be
the queen of the underworld.

02:38.520 --> 02:45.404
And now Razorhurst was about
to explode one last decisive time.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.965
Hello, Kate.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.246
Life on the coast getting
a bit dull for you, was it?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.289
Back to play with the big girls?

02:59.440 --> 03:02.410
I never left the field.
You just took your eye off the ball.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.245
While you've been playing
tit for tat with Tilly Devine,

03:05.400 --> 03:07.846
I've been expanding my horizons.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.883
The Fifty-Fifty Club?
Huh, you've been sold a pub, Phil.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.610
Keep it.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.843
You might wanna drop by,
see what I've done with the old joint,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.482
if you're not too
rushed off your feet here.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.001
You're not gonna go, are ya?

04:22.120 --> 04:24.930
You said it weren't fancy.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.323
I'd have worn stockings
without holes.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.205
It's amazing what you can achieve

04:31.360 --> 04:33.647
with a bit of spit
and polish, isn't it?

04:34.640 --> 04:37.928
You trying to impress me?
Well, I don't have to try.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.650
You're here.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.803
Lovely voice.
And ain't she gorgeous!

04:43.960 --> 04:45.962
Yeah. I need a drink.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.600
I wouldn't spend too much
of your hard-earned here, Phil.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.603
I could have you shut down
in a bee's dick.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.491
See, you don't have many friends
left in this town.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.486
Speaking of friends,
you see Edmond over there?

04:57.640 --> 05:01.281
Bigwig in the city branch
of the Bank of New South Wales.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.966
Roland, Randolf- they're brothers.

05:04.120 --> 05:07.283
Roland's a barrister,
Randolf's a solicitor.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.046
And Old Nijinsky over there -

05:10.200 --> 05:13.090
that's Justice Barnes
from the Supreme Court.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.970
I made some new friends,
befits my new status.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.966
You put three bullets
in my chest, Kate.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.364
I could crush your penny-a-pint,
sly fucking grog shops in an eye-blink,

05:25.520 --> 05:28.364
but I wanna do you slowly

05:28.520 --> 05:30.045
and watch you wither

05:30.200 --> 05:33.568
until you're nothing
but a beggar in the street...

05:35.400 --> 05:38.927
and I'm gonna enjoy
every minute of it.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.041
I was around long before you

05:44.200 --> 05:46.680
and I ain't going nowhere.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.047
Come on. Let's get out of here.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.689
Your whisky's shit, mate.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.804
Ohh!

05:57.200 --> 05:59.282
You might wanna get yourself
a new singer there, Kate.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.286
That old one...
Ooh, she's a bit off-key.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.405
You missed your chance, Calletti.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.244
Yeah, and I missed your heart
by how much?

06:55.400 --> 06:57.243
Hadn't you better get back
to your grapes and grapefruit?

06:57.400 --> 06:59.402
Grapes aren't even in season.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.845
Fruit's in my past now, Frank.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.331
Yeah?
Yeah.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.970
Come back and see me in a year

07:05.120 --> 07:08.329
and you'll still just be a hired hand
doing what Big Jim tells you to do.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.403
I don't work for Jim Devine no more.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.642
You kiss his arse for free now,
do you, mate?

07:14.520 --> 07:18.161
Nah, I hate the prick,

07:18.320 --> 07:23.087
and the fact is I'm planning on shooting
Jim Devine the first chance I get,

07:23.240 --> 07:25.766
then I'm gonna cut the ears
off his damnable corpse

07:25.920 --> 07:28.685
and I'm gonna pin them to the wall
in Stanley Street.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.530
Come on.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.011
I just saw Frank Green.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.844
Lucky you.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.164
He was looking very flash.
New clobber, new watch.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.164
He was boasting that
he was gonna kill Jim.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.685
Oh, dear.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.683
Is this your doing, Kate?

07:57.840 --> 08:02.164
You got your claws into Frank,
bought him off,

08:02.320 --> 08:05.210
poisoned his mind against me?

08:05.360 --> 08:08.489
Well, if I had,

08:08.640 --> 08:10.563
that would mean
that I was using a bloke

08:10.720 --> 08:14.008
who you turned into a killer
to kill your hubby.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.604
And wouldn't that be ironic?

08:23.080 --> 08:24.923
Frank wants to shoot me?

08:25.080 --> 08:26.570
I heard him say so myself.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.290
He'll just be joshing.

08:28.440 --> 08:32.764
Frank looks up to me. He thinks
the sun shines out my bumhole.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.761
Nice work, mate.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.048
He's not joshing, Jim.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.602
I think he's switched sides.
I think Kate Leigh's bought him.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.802
This is all your bloody fault.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.801
My fault?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.405
First thing in the morning,
it's Kate Leigh.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.244
Last thing at night, it's Kate Leigh.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.731
I said years ago you were making

08:51.880 --> 08:53.564
a rod for our backs
with all your feuding,

08:53.720 --> 08:55.927
but you wouldn't listen
and now Leigh's sicked Frank on me.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.491
Oh, quit your fucking whingeing!

08:57.640 --> 09:00.086
If Frank's seen you for
the weakling you really are,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.004
then who's to blame him, hey?

09:02.160 --> 09:04.731
I'm not the one that squibbed
shooting Barney Dalton.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.042
Oh!
Weakling, huh?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.043
Well, how weak's that, then, huh?
Oh... Ohh!

09:20.440 --> 09:22.090
What?!

09:35.560 --> 09:37.961
Um, excuse me, Frank.
What?

09:38.120 --> 09:42.170
Tilly - she wonders if your arm
might be on the mend.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.244
Well, it's just been a few weeks
since we seen you, hey, and...

09:45.400 --> 09:47.164
And she wants me, does she?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.322
Yeah, she's short-staffed on muscle.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.811
Wen, you ten Tiny

09:50.960 --> 09:53.042
there's more than one sheila
around here who wants me.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.641
Why didn't you just bring him
like I told you to, you useless ninny'?!

10:01.800 --> 10:03.290
I tried.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.441
Be fair, Percy.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.448
Hello, Guido.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.443
You got a minute?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.567
That's quite a push
you've put together.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.290
That takes a bit of clout.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.920
You spotted my talents at long last,
have you, Tilly?

10:37.080 --> 10:39.128
We've never had much in common,
have we, Guido?

10:39.280 --> 10:42.045
We've sort of moved
in different circles.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.647
Well, we got something
in common now -

10:45.800 --> 10:47.131
Frank Green.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.770
What about him?

10:48.920 --> 10:50.763
Well, he's pinched your girl
and blacked your eye

10:50.920 --> 10:53.207
more times than
I've had rumpy-pumpy.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.489
I reckon a man of your new stature
would be wanting him dead.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.084
And so do I.

11:54.920 --> 11:58.049
Tilly, of course,
had heard that Phil Jeffs was back.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.761
And Tilly was never one to look
a gift-horse in the chompers.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.924
It's a nice place, Phil.
Fairly classy.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.449
But to my mind, you're lacking
a certain je ne sais quoi.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.001
And what might that be?

12:14.040 --> 12:16.850
A little addition
to your entertainments.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.607
It'd knock that slut's shabby saloon
right out of the park.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.926
Tilly and Phil
entered into a business arrangement.

12:39.080 --> 12:43.051
Tilly would provide the Fifty-Fifty with
her prettiest girls,

12:43.200 --> 12:46.090
offering private time
to Phil's customers.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.642
Phil's cut wasn't huge,
but having his club offer girls -

12:49.800 --> 12:53.361
as well as grog
and gambling and cocaine -

12:53.520 --> 12:55.887
was a flanking manoeuvre
in his war on Kate.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.361
Phil Jeffs
is running the Fifty-Fifty.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.488
The place
is a den of iniquity -

13:00.640 --> 13:02.722
booze, gambling, snow.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.565
And now Tilly Devine's in on it,
supplying the club with her girls.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.768
And you expect me
to do your dirty work?

13:09.040 --> 13:10.565
I'm wasting my time.
Where's Bill Mackay?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.131
I wanna speak to the boss.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.611
Superintendent Mackay

13:13.760 --> 13:16.730
has got security for the bridge opening
to supervise.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.689
You're stuck with me, I'm afraid.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.491
Well, then I'm wasting
my breath as well.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.768
I hear you've commissioned
another murder.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.883
You tell that little savage Frank Green
I'm watching him.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.611
As much as I'd like to see him
take out Jim Devine,

13:36.760 --> 13:39.525
see the whole bang lot of you
go out in a hail of bullets,

13:39.680 --> 13:42.001
I actually believe
the law's worth upholding.

13:42.160 --> 13:46.643
Hmph, you sounded just
like Bill Mackay then.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.130
A poor man's version.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.120
Forgive me for talking your business,
but if I was gonna shoot someone,

13:55.280 --> 13:56.964
I wouldn't be all over Darlinghurst,
talking it up.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.451
It's called spooking
the competition.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.931
It's called being a loose-lipped,
loudmouthed galah.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.560
You don't speak to me like that!
I'll speak how I fucking want.

14:02.720 --> 14:06.202
That's my money you're spending
on yourself and your tart.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.611
I want Jim Devine dead.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.047
You can make it look like
a robbery, a break-in.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.646
I don't care. I want him dead.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.724
As soon as I get
my arm strength back.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.371
That wing of yours isn't just
an excuse, is it, Frankie?

14:20.520 --> 14:22.602
You got the guts
to kill Big Jim or don't ya?

14:22.760 --> 14:24.888
I got the guts alright,
but I'm a professional

14:25.040 --> 14:26.451
and if I'm gonna do this right,

14:26.600 --> 14:29.080
I need to be able to hold a gun,
to throw a punch

14:29.240 --> 14:31.322
and take on any of Jim's mates
who wanna have a...

14:32.960 --> 14:34.325
Oh, fuck.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.802
Oh, I'm sorry.
They moved the bloody stage!

14:37.960 --> 14:39.689
Mona, come on. For God's sake!

14:39.840 --> 14:41.683
As if I haven't got
enough troubles of my own.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.365
Just drinking beer...

14:43.520 --> 14:44.851
Stop it. Stop it!

14:45.000 --> 14:46.490
I'm throwing myself
into my performance!

14:46.640 --> 14:48.449
Stop it!

14:48.600 --> 14:50.204
Stop!

14:52.680 --> 14:55.923
I'm sorry, Kate.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.970
I'm sorry I'm so useless.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.724
I'm sorry.
Why have you stopped playing?

15:00.880 --> 15:04.009
Come clean this mess up!

15:04.160 --> 15:07.767
I'm sorry, Maysie.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.087
What are you staring at?

15:13.160 --> 15:15.401
Hey, Shoo! Get out! Go on.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.050
Get!

15:20.800 --> 15:24.168
How many times are you
gonna do this for me?

15:24.320 --> 15:26.687
For as long as you keep
doing this to yourself.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.529
I am gonna give up the booze, Katie.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.807
This time for sure.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.887
Hey, do you remember
when we first met?

15:47.040 --> 15:49.088
Mm.
Yeah.

15:49.240 --> 15:53.006
You were singing for your supper
on Bayswater Road.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.284
God.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.169
Oh, your voice was so sweet,

16:01.320 --> 16:04.005
I thought I'd died
and gone to heaven.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.129
That was a long time ago.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.203
Not that long.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.603
Go on. Give us a verse.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.091
Ugh...
Go on.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.210
Oh, Kate, I don't want to.
Please? Please!

16:44.320 --> 16:46.402
Ohh.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.961
You need a new singer, Katie.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.364
I can't do this any more.
No.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.045
I can't.
Oh, that's bullshit.

16:55.200 --> 16:59.410
No, look at the Fifty-Fifty club,
that gorgeous girl...

16:59.560 --> 17:00.561
Ohh.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.611
You need someone like her,
someone young, modern.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.967
You must be pissed

17:07.119 --> 17:09.281
'cause that's the biggest
load of bull's roar I ever heard.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.730
You could sing that smiling coconut
off the stage in any country.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.204
Hey.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.488
I need you, Mona. You know that.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.843
But, sweetheart,
I need you to be at your best.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.050
I know.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.924
I'll try, Katie.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.203
I promise.

17:44.080 --> 17:48.563
I didn't like her tone.
I'll tell you that for free.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.041
When are you going to kill Jim?

17:53.360 --> 17:57.081
As soon as this...
stops giving me gip.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.167
I've been thinking.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.209
Jim knows I'm after him.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.771
What if I front him,

18:07.920 --> 18:11.686
say that if he pays me the money
I'm owed, I won't knock him?

18:11.840 --> 18:16.368
That way, I get dosh from him and Tilly
as well as Kate.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.488
But you will still kill him?

18:19.480 --> 18:21.084
Yeah.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.651
Why?

18:22.800 --> 18:28.045
Because I wanna watch.
I've never seen anyone die before.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.851
I wanna see what it's like

18:31.000 --> 18:36.131
to face that darkness
and that emptiness.

18:38.640 --> 18:44.124
I wanna see what it's like
taking your very last breath.

18:55.840 --> 18:59.925
Guido Calletti wanted
to become Australia's Al Capone,

19:00.080 --> 19:02.811
but he was a very busy man.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.804
Not only had he agreed
to kill Frank for Tilly,

19:05.960 --> 19:09.806
he was also planning
to take over Kate's cocaine trade.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.531
The trouble was
he still hadn't figured out

19:12.680 --> 19:14.682
how she got her supplies
from the wharf

19:14.840 --> 19:16.171
Guido, hello.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.130
Where have you and your littley
been this time of night?

19:19.280 --> 19:21.760
Oh, she can't sleep.
Big pram!

19:21.920 --> 19:24.571
My ma bought it for me.
Five guineas.

19:24.720 --> 19:29.965
Five guineas? Jesus, what a devoted
grandma that Kate Leigh is, hey?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.843
Oh, she's a regular doll.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.048
Can I have a hold?
Uhh...

19:36.200 --> 19:39.010
Oh, the princess
of Darlinghurst, hey?

19:39.160 --> 19:41.083
Who's a little princess?

19:41.240 --> 19:43.129
What's this poppet's future,
hey, Percy?

19:43.280 --> 19:46.682
You gonna grow up to be
a big important lady like your grandma?

19:46.840 --> 19:49.127
Or is there something else
in store for you?

19:53.040 --> 19:54.644
I should get her back to bed.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.529
I ain't finished.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.889
3rd of May.
Yep.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.441
Actually, their's was 390.
Yeah, yeah.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.090
What's the matter?

20:06.240 --> 20:07.730
I bumped into Guido Calletti.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.803
Well, did he hurt youse?
Nah.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.610
He picked up Charlotte, though.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.845
See, my bet is Kate uses that pram
to move her snow.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.369
Kate would sell that sprog to
white slavers if there was a quid in it.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.885
Yeah, well, Eileen never went

20:23.040 --> 20:26.203
nowhere near the docks
tonight, so...

20:26.360 --> 20:28.761
What the hell's he up to?

20:32.400 --> 20:35.006
Since when does a saloon serve tea?

20:43.400 --> 20:45.687
Shh!

20:59.240 --> 21:01.288
Understand?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.885
Grab the boys.
Meet in the usual spot.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.691
Yes, everything was going swimmingly

21:13.840 --> 21:15.604
for Aussie Al Capone.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.967
Too bad he'd forgotten about
the Consorting Squad.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.600
Oh, go!

21:22.920 --> 21:26.208
Get off, you pig!
We weren't doing nothing!

21:26.360 --> 21:28.488
didn't make
the consorting laws, mate.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.090
Ohh!

21:53.560 --> 21:56.689
Now, here's how I see this, Guido.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.729
You shouldn't have raised
a hand to my property.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.644
You shouldn't have
raised a hand to my people.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.850
You shouldn't have raised anything
other than your hat to me and mine.

22:06.440 --> 22:11.082
And you shouldn't have gone near
my daughter or granddaughter.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.645
There will
be a hundred police

22:39.800 --> 22:41.131
stationed along the entry streets.

22:41.280 --> 22:45.046
The north and the south?
Aye, north and south ends.

22:46.520 --> 22:49.171
Every man is drilled.
Every man is ready for trouble.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.004
Then there won't be any.
There won't be any.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.128
We need this to go well, Bill.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.089
I do, you do,
God knows the people do.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.562
I don't want ratbags of any colour
spoiling their day.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.291
There won't be
any trouble, Mr Premier.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.210
We got plenty of stock in?
Plenty of fizz?

23:23.360 --> 23:25.010
Pink as well for the ladies.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.243
Oh, you put the call out, didn't you?
It's gonna be a big night tonight.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.448
Been shouting myself hoarse up
and down the streets.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.251
Party at Katie's!

23:36.120 --> 23:39.044
What a picture-bloody-perfect day.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.043
Come on, Premier! Over to you!

23:42.680 --> 23:45.923
This is John Harper
announcing the Paramount Sound News.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.880
This is Saturday,
19 March 1932-

23:50.040 --> 23:52.441
the official opening
of the Sydney Harbour Bridge-

23:52.600 --> 23:56.400
The arrival of
the Premier of New South Wales,

23:56.560 --> 24:00.929
the Honorable J.D. Lang.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.402
It was a moment
the whole country

24:18.560 --> 24:20.801
had been anticipating
for over a decade,

24:20.960 --> 24:25.602
but the ceremony didn't go
quite according to plan.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.450
The New Guardsman Francis De Groot,

24:30.600 --> 24:33.809
appalled that a Labor premier was
doing the honors and not the King,

24:33.960 --> 24:36.008
pipped Lang at the post.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.882
Luckily, none other than
Superintendent Bill Mackay

24:44.040 --> 24:47.806
was there to ask him nicely
to cease and desist.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.650
The ribbon was retied

24:52.800 --> 24:55.246
and Jack Lang
eventually got his big moment.

24:55.400 --> 25:00.930
The bridge everyone had waited
so long for was finally open.

25:15.520 --> 25:19.286
Sydney Harbour Bridge
was more than just a thoroughfare.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.522
In the middle
of the Great Depression,

25:21.680 --> 25:25.651
it was a symbol that the nation -
less than four decades old -

25:25.800 --> 25:27.962
was growing up.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.484
How did that idiot get through?!

25:35.640 --> 25:37.688
No-one noticed an extra horseman
in the honour guard.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.127
But you managed to get him
locked up at last?

25:40.280 --> 25:41.850
He's being brought here as we speak.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.331
Throw the fucking book at him -

25:43.480 --> 25:46.723
assault with a deadly weapon,
attempted murder, treason.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.451
I want him hung,
drawn and quartered.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.490
You know, Mr Premier,
I don't think that's such a good idea.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.451
I don't think you're in any position
to offer such advice, Bill.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.001
The New Guard want
to appear victimized.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.527
They want you acting like a tyrant.

26:01.680 --> 26:04.411
De Groot would love nothing better
than for us to make him a martyr.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.086
The man waved a bloody sword
at my face.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.890
I won't just do nothing!

26:09.040 --> 26:11.725
I'm not suggesting we do nothing.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.360
It should never have been Lang
cutting that ribbon.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.568
Where was the King?
The Governor-General?

26:16.720 --> 26:19.451
Do you feel your message is appreciated
by the people of Sydney?

26:19.600 --> 26:20.931
Well, it's certainly not appreciated

26:21.080 --> 26:22.411
by Premier Lang
and his communist buddies.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.847
Huh! Ahh!

26:25.000 --> 26:29.608
And what trumped-up charges are you
bringing against me, Superintendent?

26:29.760 --> 26:33.731
None. Mr De Groot
won't be staying with us.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.484
I deem this man to be insane.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.928
What's this? I'm perfectly sane.
You're silly and childish.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.004
Thinks by waving a sabre in the air,
he officially opened the bridge.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.161
I did!

26:43.320 --> 26:46.722
I opened it for the decent and loyal
citizens of New South Wales.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.326
You're not fit to go into the cells.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.165
Take this man to the mental ward
for a proper examination.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.810
Francis De Groot
was eventually charged

26:54.960 --> 26:57.804
with the single of fence
of damaging government property -

26:57.960 --> 26:59.769
one blue ribbon -

26:59.920 --> 27:02.526
and fined a week's wages.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.811
J' Mary had a little lamb

27:17.960 --> 27:21.442
Oh, what? I saw your husband there
last night at my knocking shop.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.804
There's children here.
Oh, shut up, sister.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.530
Go suck an egg.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.045
om

27:44.440 --> 27:46.124
Want me to add
damaging police property

27:46.280 --> 27:47.930
to obscene language
and resist arrest?

27:48.080 --> 27:50.686
Why don't you come in here
and see how your kidneys take

27:50.840 --> 27:52.251
to being frozen solid?

27:52.400 --> 27:53.765
I can provide you with a blanket.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.604
Full of vermin and lice? No, thanks.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.969
Oi! I want to make a phone call.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.963
I can make one on your behalf
to a lawyer or next of kin.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.485
Next of kin will be fine.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.450
Call my husband and tell him
to bring my fucking fur.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.723
No, Mr Devine,
I don't know whether she meant

28:12.880 --> 28:14.405
her silver fox or her Russian sable.

28:14.560 --> 28:18.326
Just bring her a coat so I don't have to
listen to her complain.

28:21.240 --> 28:25.290
So that's what marriage means - a man
bringing your coat when you're cold.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.966
Also it means a lot of black eyes
and heartbreak for Tilly,

28:28.120 --> 28:29.451
from what I hear.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.683
At least she's not alone.

28:37.760 --> 28:40.081
Special Sergeant Armfield?
Mm?

28:40.240 --> 28:42.686
Today's my last day.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.523
I'm getting married.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.047
But you...

28:50.680 --> 28:52.444
Right. uh...

28:53.880 --> 28:55.450
Well...

28:56.440 --> 28:59.967
I'll be sad to lose an officer
so soon after you joined us...

29:00.960 --> 29:02.644
but I'm sure marriage will be...

29:04.680 --> 29:07.604
will be good for you.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.122
Told her yet?
Hm.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.489
Congratulations to both of you.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.608
Thanks, Lillian. I'm sorry.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.842
I realise I'm gonna probably
make your job a lot harder,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.331
snaffling away
one of your new recruits.

29:20.480 --> 29:24.121
But when it feels right,
you gotta seize the opportunity.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.370
Tilly.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.045
I brought you the white marabou...

29:40.120 --> 29:41.804
although it might show the dirt.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.403
Thanks.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.763
Are they keeping you in overnight?

29:53.120 --> 29:55.327
Do you need anything else?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.322
Tiny.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.528
What?

30:03.520 --> 30:06.171
Nothing.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.163
Can't live with 'em.
Can't shoot 'em.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.488
Are you married, mate?

30:26.640 --> 30:30.042
Er, yeah. 42 years.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.282
Never a cross word, hey?

30:34.040 --> 30:36.441
I've seen you round.
You're a cabbie, right?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.125
Yeah.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.603
Did you serve at all, mate?
Boer War.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.842
Too old for the last one.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.083
Belgium. 4th Tunnellers.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.129
The things we've seen,
eh, as soldiers,

30:52.280 --> 30:55.887
things no man should have to.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.050
G'day, Jim.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.524
What do you want?

31:03.680 --> 31:07.730
Let's open with what you owe me -
25 quid, for starters.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.202
I don't owe you a thing.
If anything, you owe me.

31:11.360 --> 31:15.729
Give me that money, Jim,
if you want a long and happy life.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.770
You stay-at-home johnnies ain't worth
the stink off a digger's shit.

31:24.080 --> 31:28.688
Come on, mate. It just so happens
I'm in need of a bloody taxi.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.330
Uh, yeah...

31:38.080 --> 31:40.731
I couldn't do it here, alright?

31:40.880 --> 31:43.804
I need a drink. Sherry, please.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.122
What are you looking at?

31:58.360 --> 32:00.203
Do it tonight.

32:01.320 --> 32:05.530
Once you've finished him,
you go after Tilly.

32:27.360 --> 32:32.287
Five bob to wait here. Hey! Hey!

32:32.440 --> 32:35.091
Forget it. Forget him.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.850
You really gonna do it?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.607
Blood oath, I am.
Are you really going to watch?

32:59.280 --> 33:03.046
I really should get going. My missus
will be wondering what I'm up to.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.611
Oh, yeah? Good sort, your lady?

33:04.760 --> 33:06.364
The best.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.568
Mine too. Best girl in the world.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.529
I'd do anything for her.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.967
You'd think she would have worked
that out by now, wouldn't you?

33:13.120 --> 33:14.884
But, no. No. She's just...

33:26.560 --> 33:28.688
What you gonna do, Frank?

33:31.720 --> 33:33.802
I'm gonna blow your guts out.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.485
Do it, then, you little brat,

33:35.640 --> 33:37.642
'cause I'm just about jack
of all of this anyway.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.849
Go on, Frank. Do it.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.126
Do it! Come on!

34:01.880 --> 34:04.281
Come on.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.487
My wife gave me that bloody tie pin.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.960
Why didn't you shoot him?
He was just there.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.681
Stop there, Frank,
and give me the bloody tie pin.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.808
I'll stop nothing.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.848
Come out here and don't be a dog.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.126
Watch out, Fred.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.369
He's trying to kill us.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.009
Drive.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.371
Drive!

34:50.000 --> 34:53.891
Drive. Drive. Drive.

35:26.840 --> 35:30.811
I didn't mean to hit him.
I was aiming for the bloody rear.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.042
Frank turned up to kill me. I just...

35:34.080 --> 35:36.048
Oh, what happens now, Tilly?

35:36.200 --> 35:39.761
What happens to us now?

35:42.800 --> 35:47.283
Hey, what... What's going on?
You're being released? Hey, Tilly!

35:47.440 --> 35:51.081
You're being released, sweetheart?
Hey, Tilly girl.

35:51.240 --> 35:54.926
We're apples, aren't we, sweetheart?
Right as rain and peachy?

35:55.080 --> 35:58.971
When you get bail, I'll send Nugget.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.802
Jim was eventually granted bail,

36:04.960 --> 36:08.931
but Tilly somehow forgot
to send the car for him.

36:09.080 --> 36:12.926
So he just hung around Darlinghurst,
waiting to see what turned up.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.002
Bastard put me off,
having a go like that.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.003
He put me off my game.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.561
As soon as he's bailed,
I'm gonna go out there again,

36:21.720 --> 36:25.122
and I'm gonna put one
right between his eyes this time.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.362
You hear me, Nellie?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.764
Nellie?

36:35.680 --> 36:37.330
His eyes.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.722
His blood.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.928
Green!

36:43.080 --> 36:45.651
No. No.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.087
What do you see him, Nell?

36:49.840 --> 36:51.490
What's he give you that I don't?

36:51.640 --> 36:53.768
He almost died for me.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.366
I would die for you, Nell.
I would die.

36:56.520 --> 37:00.047
I would kill him first
and then I'd die for you.

37:00.200 --> 37:03.329
Please. No. No. Please don't... Don't...

37:04.880 --> 37:08.930
Jesus, Nell. Which one of us
do you actually want?

37:11.760 --> 37:15.048
Let's settle this once and for all.

37:37.520 --> 37:38.726
Come on. Get up.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.607
Stand aside!

37:45.760 --> 37:47.888
How do we break them up?
We don't.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.964
Bit of luck they'll kill each other
and save us a lot of bother.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.526
They fought for over an hour;

38:01.680 --> 38:05.480
one of the great stand-up,
one-on-one street fights of the era.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.925
Nell, please.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.880
You gotta... You gotta...

38:32.160 --> 38:33.650
Er...

38:33.800 --> 38:36.610
Let's solve this
like civilized people, hey?

38:36.760 --> 38:41.322
Heads, it's Frank.
Tails, it's Guido.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.285
Tails.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.051
Phil Jeffs
was content to bide his time

39:55.200 --> 39:58.044
and watch Kate and Tilly battle.

40:02.520 --> 40:06.525
Their war had taken the life
of an innocent bystander

40:06.680 --> 40:10.287
and that meant the game was oven

40:10.440 --> 40:12.966
The police commissioner
would like a word.

40:13.120 --> 40:16.249
So this is where
your feuding's brought us to,

40:16.400 --> 40:18.528
an innocent man shot to pieces.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.762
It's a bridge too bloody far

40:21.920 --> 40:26.482
and it will not happen again
on my watch.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.480
Grog and girls, hey?

40:33.200 --> 40:35.931
Part of the city,
whatever the law says.

40:37.040 --> 40:41.807
So if you, Kate,
run your sly grogging,

40:41.960 --> 40:45.760
and you, Tilly, run your brothels
quietly and cleanly,

40:45.920 --> 40:49.845
then I will ensure you do so
with a minimum of police harassment.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.562
But the shootings, the slashings,
the mayhem stops.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.441
You call off Green.
You call off Calletti.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.841
No more murders as of now. For good.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.490
See, you have a choice, ladies.

41:06.640 --> 41:11.680
Behave yourselves
and we'll all get along fine.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.603
So we have a deal?

41:31.120 --> 41:32.451
Where are the guns?

41:32.600 --> 41:34.921
The cops took them all.
What do you want a gun for?

41:35.080 --> 41:37.162
I'm going to kill Kate Leigh.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.845
Come off the grass, Tilly.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.210
Aha! Get the car.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.964
You don't want to be doing this.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.487
Get the fucking car.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.571
Yeah.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.051
Let's settle this.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.885
The cemetery at 8:00,
if you've got the guts.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.562
I got the guts.
Go on, then.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.927
I fancy you spending
the rest of your life in Long Bay.

42:52.080 --> 42:55.323
Really? 'Cause I'm partial
to seeing you swing.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.283
Come on.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.850
Then where will that leave us?

43:07.040 --> 43:08.849
Hanged, jailed or shot.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.525
Yeah

43:10.680 --> 43:13.650
Ready for any one of those blokes
to take our place.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.007
And make a bloody mess of it.

43:29.560 --> 43:32.530
We leave the dead here, then?
Yeah.

43:40.880 --> 43:43.008
You still owe me five bob.

43:43.160 --> 43:45.083
You owe me a fucking dog.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.965
Once upon a time,

43:51.120 --> 43:55.250
there were two rival queens who waged
war on each other for so long

43:55.400 --> 43:58.768
they came to realise that while
they couldn't live with each other;

43:58.920 --> 44:01.571
they couldn't live
without each other either

44:11.400 --> 44:14.643
It all happened getting on
for 100 years ago.

44:14.800 --> 44:19.442
What became of them,
those colorful citizens of Razorhurst?

44:21.760 --> 44:23.922
Well, Nellie married Guido,

44:24.080 --> 44:27.209
but she left him after
only a couple of months.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.203
She went back to prostitution,

44:29.360 --> 44:32.330
back to falling in love
with bad men who owned hen

44:32.480 --> 44:36.280
But no-one ever really owned
Nellie Cameron.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.329
No-one ever really knew her

44:38.480 --> 44:43.771
or knew why in just a few years
she would put her head in a gas oven.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.441
After Nellie dumped him,

44:48.600 --> 44:52.810
Guido Calletti went back to the
consolation prize of Dulcie Markham...

44:56.520 --> 44:58.409
back to declaring
he was going to set up

44:58.560 --> 45:02.804
the biggest criminal empire
Australia had ever seen.

45:02.960 --> 45:06.601
He didn't even see the declaration
of World War II.

45:06.760 --> 45:10.446
Back at his fruit and veg barrow
to make ends meet,

45:10.600 --> 45:14.810
he got into one argument too many
and came off second best.

45:17.080 --> 45:21.927
Frank Green's career as a gunman
was pretty much at an end.

45:22.080 --> 45:25.209
By World War II, he was reduced
to working as a cockatoo

45:25.360 --> 45:27.010
for an SP betting shop.

45:27.160 --> 45:32.644
By 1956, he was dead
after a quarrel with his lover.

45:32.800 --> 45:36.407
Big Jim Devine was acquitted of
taxi driver Fred Moffitt's murder

45:36.560 --> 45:39.450
But his chronic gambling and violence

45:39.600 --> 45:41.329
were wearing out his welcome
in Maroubra.

45:41.480 --> 45:46.008
By 1946, Tilly had finally had enough
and she divorced him.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.242
Heartbroken, Jim moved to Melbourne

45:48.400 --> 45:52.325
where he worked as a pub bouncer
and ended his days a lonely old man.

45:52.480 --> 45:57.281
Phil 'The Jew's vow to do Kate slowly
came to nothing in the end,

45:57.440 --> 46:00.011
when his gangster past
caught up with him.

46:00.160 --> 46:03.721
A bullet he'd carried
in his gut since 1929

46:03.880 --> 46:07.680
suddenly turned septic
and killed him before he was 50.

46:07.840 --> 46:11.890
Kate outlasted him,
just as she'd promised.

46:12.040 --> 46:15.567
Eileen Leigh had her fair share
of scrapes with the law,

46:15.720 --> 46:18.530
including getting done
for nicking a fur coat.

46:18.680 --> 46:21.251
But perhaps her daughter
was the making of her

46:21.400 --> 46:25.371
because she certainly didn't follow
in Kate's criminal footsteps.

46:25.520 --> 46:28.649
And what of the faithful retainers,

46:28.800 --> 46:33.283
Bill 'The Octopus' Flanagan,
May Seckold,

46:33.440 --> 46:38.446
the man known as 'Nugget' whose real
name may have been Henry Pierce,

46:38.600 --> 46:41.046
and Kate's pal, Mona Woods?

46:44.560 --> 46:48.451
Who can say? One thing's for sure.
They're long dead now.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.887
Vale to them all.

46:52.040 --> 46:53.371
As for the police,

46:53.520 --> 46:56.683
Ray 'The Blizzard' Blissett
rose to the rank of superintendent

46:56.840 --> 46:58.968
and headed up the Consorting Squad.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.327
He was awarded medals
for distinguished service

47:01.480 --> 47:03.528
and lived to a ripe old age.

47:04.720 --> 47:09.601
Tom Wickham went on to become
chief superintendent of the NSW CIB.

47:09.760 --> 47:14.926
In 1946, he was awarded a King's Medal
for distinguished service.

47:15.080 --> 47:20.086
Tom's partner Syd Thompson, left
the force under a cloud in the 1950s.

47:20.240 --> 47:22.208
The less said, the better

47:22.360 --> 47:26.649
Bill Mackay was a great pragmatist
and a great reformer

47:26.800 --> 47:30.646
He almost singlehandedly
created the NSW Police Force.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.280
He was also a great boozer.

47:33.440 --> 47:38.765
After a decade as commissioner;
he died of a heart attack in 1948.

47:39.760 --> 47:43.003
Lillian Armfield
went on helping fallen women

47:43.160 --> 47:45.561
until she retired in 1949,

47:45.720 --> 47:49.486
the year after women officers
were finally issued uniforms.

47:49.640 --> 47:54.441
She died alone
in her one-room flat aged 86.

47:54.600 --> 47:58.685
So that left just Kate and Tilly.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.002
New generations muscled in on them,

48:01.160 --> 48:03.128
laws were passed against them,

48:03.280 --> 48:06.363
and the real scourge
of all gangsters, the tax man,

48:06.520 --> 48:08.409
inevitably came knocking.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.562
Gardez I'eau!

48:13.720 --> 48:17.406
Neither woman ever recaptured
the glory days of the '20s.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.961
Their roaring days were oven

48:20.120 --> 48:21.770
Kate kicked the bucket at 84

48:21.920 --> 48:24.287
and hundreds came to her funeral
to say goodbye.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.842
When poor old Tilly
passed away six years later;

48:28.000 --> 48:30.526
there was barely a soul
to shed a team

48:33.480 --> 48:35.642
But never before or since

48:35.800 --> 48:40.010
has the underworld in Sydney,
in Australia, or anywhere

48:40.160 --> 48:42.731
been so dominated by just two people,

48:42.880 --> 48:45.247
and two women at that.

48:47.080 --> 48:51.085
Long live Queen Kate.
Long live Queen Tilly.
