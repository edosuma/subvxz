WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:06.538
Man (over radio):
<i> You really don't know</i>
<i> who to vote for.</i>

00:06.540 --> 00:08.674
(woman speaking indistinctly
over radio)

00:08.676 --> 00:10.409
Woman:
If you think about it,
you know...

00:10.411 --> 00:12.144
(tires screeching)
look out!

00:18.285 --> 00:19.284
Are you good?
Yeah.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.120
Ma'am!

00:21.122 --> 00:22.121
Are you okay?

00:22.123 --> 00:23.389
Can you hear me?

00:23.791 --> 00:26.058
Hey, call an ambulance!

00:26.060 --> 00:27.793
(electrical crackling)

00:27.795 --> 00:28.360
Jones!

00:32.800 --> 00:34.733
(grunts)

00:46.814 --> 00:49.081
¶ ¶

01:07.435 --> 01:09.201
Deeks:
<i> Third time this week</i>

01:09.203 --> 01:10.803
<i> My leftovers have disappeared</i>
<i> from the fridge.</i>

01:10.805 --> 01:12.571
<i> So how do you</i>
<i> explain that, huh?</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:14.606
Kensi: I don't have
to explain anything,

01:14.608 --> 01:16.475
Because I didn't do anything.
We both know

01:16.477 --> 01:18.477
You have a weakness
for my loco moco.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.212
Nope.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.580
If not you, then who?
Huh? Monty?
(chuckles)

01:21.582 --> 01:23.649
I don't know,
he's a pretty smart pooch.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.484
That's not cool.
You're blaming my best friend.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.152
I th-- I thought
I was your best friend.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.253
No, no.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.255
Don't do your
switch-craft on me.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.490
I keep saying to you,
you just...

01:31.492 --> 01:33.292
You don't mess with
a man's leftovers.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.427
And what I keep saying
is that you're insane, deeks!

01:35.429 --> 01:36.662
Guys, we need you upstairs.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.464
Hurry.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.666
All right, just so you know, I'm
getting to the bottom of this.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.634
Want to know why? 'cause I'm
a detective. I detect.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.869
It's what I do.
Okay.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.604
Only thing you'll be doing
later is apologizing.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.306
Oh-ho-ho. No.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.141
Nell:
Office park security cameras

01:49.143 --> 01:50.542
Picked up a carjacking
in the valley.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.244
Hidden hills produce.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.379
That produce truck
is actually

01:53.380 --> 01:54.513
An undercover
military transport

01:54.515 --> 01:56.148
Carrying a load

01:56.150 --> 01:57.382
Of compromised
ak-47s.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.684
Nell:
And it gets better.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.119
Hold on a second.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.121
Is that nate?

02:02.890 --> 02:04.389
Callen:
Damn. It is.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.858
What the hell is he doing?

02:05.860 --> 02:06.859
Granger:
Well, hetty sent nate

02:06.861 --> 02:08.660
On a long-term
undercover.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.229
He's investigating

02:10.231 --> 02:12.764
Organized crime's
link to terrorism in l.A.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.333
When was last contact?

02:16.137 --> 02:17.503
12 weeks ago.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.605
He went dark

02:19.607 --> 02:20.672
And we had no
idea where he was

02:20.674 --> 02:22.241
Until this
showed up.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.809
Well, if he was trying to
infiltrate organized crime,

02:23.811 --> 02:25.794
It looks like
he was successful.

02:25.795 --> 02:27.778
Regardless, we need to find him
and bring him in. Fast.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.348
You think he's in over his head?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.150
The fact he hasn't
made contact

02:31.152 --> 02:32.718
Suggests he is,

02:32.720 --> 02:34.520
Even if he doesn't realize it.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.255
Who's the woman?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.756
Nell:
No id on his companion,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.324
But facial rec is
currently running.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.792
How many aks were stolen?

02:40.794 --> 02:41.927
100 aks

02:41.929 --> 02:44.296
And over 2,000 rounds
of rhino ammo

02:44.298 --> 02:45.781
Tagged for disposal.

02:45.782 --> 02:47.265
That's enough to arm
a small militia

02:47.268 --> 02:48.634
Or tip the balance
in a gang war.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.669
We can't let those weapons
hit the street.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.904
Where are the drivers?

02:51.906 --> 02:53.272
Marine sergeants edward jones

02:53.274 --> 02:54.273
And kevin brickson
are being treated

02:54.275 --> 02:55.941
At st. Anne's hospital.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.476
You take the hospital.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.845
We'll hit the crime scene.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.283
You're good to go.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.654
Sergeant jones?

03:08.656 --> 03:10.822
I'm special agent
kensi blye, ncis.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.291
This is my partner,
detective deeks.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.625
Like I told atf,

03:13.627 --> 03:15.360
I followed protocol.
Deeks:
No, we understand.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.296
We just have
a few questions for you.

03:17.298 --> 03:17.896
Where's brickson?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.498
Still in surgery.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.333
Doc says he's
gonna be fine.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.368
Kensi: Do you remember the
attackers mentioning anything?

03:23.370 --> 03:25.237
A time?
Maybe a location?

03:25.239 --> 03:27.539
Only thing I heard
was my brain frying.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.908
Uh, did you recognize anybody?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.894
No.

03:31.895 --> 03:33.879
I mean, whoever they were
knew our disposal routine.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.381
For one, who jacks
a produce truck?

03:36.383 --> 03:39.384
And two, we change the truck
and the route with each mission.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.787
Okay.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.692
Nate used classified
information to pull this off.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.627
Maybe even brought the weapons
to their attention.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.828
Yeah, he put a huge arsenal
in their hands.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.181
It's a big gamble.

03:52.182 --> 03:54.533
And too dangerous
for nate to pull off solo.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.835
I mean, right reasons or not,
this could get bad real fast.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.338
Let's see where nell is
iding nate's new friend.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.305
Maybe she's the one
calling the shots.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.707
Let's go.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.342
(indistinct radio chatter)

04:03.344 --> 04:04.443
Once they got 'em
out of the truck,

04:04.445 --> 04:05.444
They were easy targets.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.312
It's efficient.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.380
Doesn't make sense.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.484
Nate is smart enough to
avoid common surveillance.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.419
What, did he
just slip up?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.556
Or did he want to get caught?

04:17.558 --> 04:18.890
Maybe he knew he was in trouble,

04:18.892 --> 04:20.659
This was his way
of reaching out for help.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.995
Maybe, if he can't
make secure contact.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.513
But even if he is being watched,

04:24.514 --> 04:26.030
How hard is it
to get a message to us?

04:26.033 --> 04:28.734
Unless he isn't trying to.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.402
Look, nate's one of
the smartest guys we know.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.271
For now, we need to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.823
I don't know.

04:33.824 --> 04:35.374
Hetty may have bitten off
more than nate can chew.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.011
You think she put him
in the game too early?

04:39.013 --> 04:41.046
She may have overestimated
his skill.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.681
He's operating
without a safety net.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.049
We do that all the time.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.384
Yeah, but the difference is,

04:45.386 --> 04:46.451
We know if one of us falls,

04:46.453 --> 04:47.686
We'll be there for each other.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.788
Nate doesn't
have that luxury.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.290
(phone rings)

04:51.292 --> 04:52.958
It's eric.
What's up, eric?

04:52.960 --> 04:53.959
Traffic cam caught

04:53.961 --> 04:55.144
The produce truck

04:55.145 --> 04:56.328
At a wildlife reserve
in santa clarita

04:56.330 --> 04:57.763
About an hour ago.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.930
Where is it now?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.632
Don't know.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.333
No cameras in the reserve,
but we haven't seen it leave.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.335
Could still be there.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.469
We're on our way.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.537
Thanks, eric.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.809
Callen:
<i> There it is.</i>

05:12.513 --> 05:13.879
<i> Eric, we found the truck.</i>

05:13.881 --> 05:14.880
<i> It looks deserted.</i>

05:14.882 --> 05:16.048
Eric:
<i> Copy that.</i>

05:29.063 --> 05:30.362
Sam!

05:30.364 --> 05:32.497
I got nate.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.099
He's breathing.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.734
Nate, can you hear me?

05:35.736 --> 05:36.968
Come on, buddy.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.471
Come out now!

05:40.474 --> 05:41.440
Put your hands up!

05:41.442 --> 05:42.441
Drop your weapons!

05:42.443 --> 05:43.575
Now.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.410
What took you so long?

05:46.613 --> 05:48.380
Callen:
Drop your weapons!

05:49.783 --> 05:51.917
You forgot to say
"federal agents,"

05:51.919 --> 05:53.752
So I'm going to need you two
to drop<i> your</i> weapons.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.636
Drop your weapons!

06:11.638 --> 06:12.771
What the hell's
going on?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.473
I think the technical term

06:14.475 --> 06:16.007
Is "a double cross."

06:17.845 --> 06:19.644
Weapons on
the ground now.

06:19.646 --> 06:20.712
Now!

06:26.053 --> 06:27.486
This one.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.054
Get him in
the truck.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.090
Why not both of us?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.558
Get a two-for-one?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.060
One is plenty.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.595
Woman:
Easy.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.530
Sudden movements

06:38.532 --> 06:39.598
Are contagious.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.400
You jump, I jump...

06:41.402 --> 06:43.902
That's how people get shot.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.804
Sam:
Don't worry,
I got you, g.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.406
Nate:
Projecting confidence

06:47.408 --> 06:48.740
In the face of adversity.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.042
I'm gonna project confidence
into your face

06:51.044 --> 06:52.411
When this is all over.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.745
Maybe next time.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.147
We have to go.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.048
Turn around.
Sam:
Oh, no.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.417
You want to shoot me,

06:58.419 --> 06:59.885
You got to look me in the eyes.

06:59.887 --> 07:00.619
So be it.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.053
(gunshots)

07:04.057 --> 07:06.024
I would listen
to what she says.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.128
What are you doing?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.880
You shoot him,

07:11.881 --> 07:13.631
His partner will never
give us what we want.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.204
We don't have
time for this.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.472
Let's go.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.116
Don't worry, g, I'll find you!

07:34.121 --> 07:35.120
Nate:
Stop for a second.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.858
Always wanted to do that.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.926
Go.

07:49.536 --> 07:50.802
(phone speed-dialing)

07:50.804 --> 07:52.103
(line ringing)

07:52.105 --> 07:53.104
Eric:
Sam?

07:53.106 --> 07:54.039
Eric.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.974
I need you to find that truck.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.042
They've got callen.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.109
On it.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.846
Where's sam?

08:00.847 --> 08:01.980
Guys from the motor
pool picked him up.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.181
He's on his way.
Callen?

08:03.183 --> 08:05.717
No, but facial rec
matched our mystery woman

08:05.719 --> 08:07.185
To several major robberies

08:07.187 --> 08:08.019
Over the span
of three years.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.155
Meet alisa chambers,

08:10.157 --> 08:13.725
The only link between several
elite heists across the u.S.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.193
Diamonds in dc,

08:15.195 --> 08:16.928
Gold in texas,

08:16.930 --> 08:18.563
Two banks
in seattle.
She's been busy.

08:18.565 --> 08:19.731
And they're calling her
"the black widow"

08:19.733 --> 08:21.266
Since anyone she's
ever worked with

08:21.268 --> 08:22.267
Has gone missing

08:22.269 --> 08:23.635
Or turned up dead.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.104
Why steal ak-47s
set for disposal?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.640
The value is nowhere near
that of diamonds or gold.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.076
Maybe it's not the aks,
maybe it's the ammo.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.178
Armor-piercing rhinos.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.713
Got to be planning
something big.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.714
Yeah.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.082
Why take callen hostage?

08:37.084 --> 08:38.083
Leverage?

08:38.085 --> 08:39.518
I feel like it would be

08:39.520 --> 08:40.752
Something more specific
than that.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.754
This makes no sense.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.556
This isn't who nate is.

08:44.558 --> 08:47.092
Maybe it isn't.
What do you mean?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.827
What if he wrote checks
that he couldn't cash?

08:48.829 --> 08:50.262
One lie leads to another
and it just snowballs.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.796
And this is nate's way

08:51.798 --> 08:53.265
Of getting callen
on the inside with him.
Yeah.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.933
You know,
granger was saying

08:54.935 --> 08:56.134
That nate was investigating
a connection

08:56.136 --> 08:57.802
Between organized crime
and terrorism.

08:57.804 --> 08:58.803
Maybe he found a link.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.071
Could be.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.806
Let's cross-check
alisa chambers

09:01.808 --> 09:03.275
With all known terrorist
groups in the database.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.809
On it.

09:04.811 --> 09:05.810
Hopefully get lucky.

09:05.812 --> 09:06.811
Oh, yeah.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.680
Hopefully.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.221
Easy, buddy,
that's my lucky jacket, okay?

09:17.124 --> 09:18.690
(grunts)

09:29.202 --> 09:30.135
Nate:
Hey, callen.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.804
Or is it, uh, "grisha"?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.575
Tell me, has knowing
made a difference?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.043
How do you know that name?

09:38.045 --> 09:39.277
Your whole life

09:39.279 --> 09:40.712
Is built around
finding out

09:40.714 --> 09:42.581
Who you are.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.115
I mean, the search
is just this

09:44.117 --> 09:45.684
Security blanket,
right?

09:45.686 --> 09:48.853
And now that it's gone,

09:48.855 --> 09:51.656
Who are you?

09:51.658 --> 09:53.258
Do you even know?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.160
I have no idea.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.294
I was actually going
to talk to hetty

09:56.296 --> 09:57.662
About getting
a little nate time,

09:57.664 --> 10:00.131
But clearly
you've lost your mind.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.000
Actually, I'm thinking clearly

10:02.002 --> 10:05.036
For the first time
in a long time.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.172
We trusted you.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.107
We all make mistakes, right?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.044
Okay.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.181
I'll play.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.785
Why steal a batch
of compromised ak-47s?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.120
Great question.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.788
You tell me.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.791
It's not about
the ak-47s, is it?

10:26.793 --> 10:28.193
It's a test.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.196
First order of business
when turning an asset

10:31.198 --> 10:34.199
Is to test the validity
of your intel.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.801
Oh, and grabbing a federal
agent, that's also a test.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.871
Which he passed
with flying colors.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.375
Oh. Ooh.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.844
Look at you.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.715
I mean, she's hot.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.116
I-I don't know
that she's "treason hot,"

10:51.118 --> 10:53.818
But, uh, I hope there's
something more to this.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.820
Putting our lives on the line
for the greater good

10:55.822 --> 10:57.822
Just wasn't cutting it,

10:57.824 --> 11:01.259
And, frankly, this has
an odd sense of freedom.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.128
(chuckles)

11:03.130 --> 11:05.263
You're not free.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.999
But you<i> are</i> in too deep.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.002
Actually, I haven't
gone deep enough.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.171
I should have done
this years ago.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.073
Hetty will be disappointed.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.208
Ah, hetty.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.077
Kind of ironic, isn't it?

11:19.079 --> 11:22.047
I mean, she made both of us,
and here we are.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.349
Like you say,
we all make mistakes.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.319
Well, I'm done being
hetty's flunky.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.455
Now I have some questions
for you.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.358
Hopefully you have
answers for me.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.360
I will try,
but I have to tell you,

11:35.362 --> 11:39.197
My... Memory...
Is a little fuzzy.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.067
If you're stalling, waiting
for the cavalry to come,

11:42.069 --> 11:43.401
They're not.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.470
No signal gets in or
out of this place.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.407
Scrambler.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.942
That's clever.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.245
Now back to those questions.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.247
Where can we find jd-x?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.783
"jd-x"?

11:58.785 --> 12:01.186
Is that a dj in vegas?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.487
Friend of yours?

12:02.489 --> 12:05.356
Stable, high-impact,
heat-resistant explosive,

12:05.358 --> 12:07.292
Used by nasa.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.294
You know what I'm
talking about.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.963
Sounds very dangerous.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.935
He just needs loosening
up a little bit.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.303
Ooh. Really?

12:18.305 --> 12:20.038
Yeah.

12:23.343 --> 12:26.344
Time for my sponge bath,
I guess?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.880
Nate: You know,
back in the day,

12:28.882 --> 12:30.882
Waterboarding was
the technique of choice,

12:30.884 --> 12:32.183
'cause it left no marks.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.351
Callen:
Well, that's
the problem today.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.220
Too many people living
in the past.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.790
Back.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.525
Okay.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.432
Couldn't get anything
out of hetty,

12:47.434 --> 12:50.335
But she's definitely concerned.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.904
Hmm.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.372
You okay?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.241
I don't know what I am.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.009
I mean, is nate in danger?

12:58.011 --> 13:00.311
Is callen?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.313
Is there a plan?

13:02.315 --> 13:06.084
If he is in trouble, I just wish
he'd reach out somehow.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.086
Maybe he did.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.554
Maybe that's what this is.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.422
Maybe.

13:11.424 --> 13:15.560
But what if he's not in trouble?

13:15.562 --> 13:17.462
Then what is he doing?

13:19.399 --> 13:21.065
I wish I had the answers.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.167
(door opens)
me, too.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.835
Any luck on g?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.470
I wish we had
better news.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.104
Callen would have found a
way to contact us by now.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.941
Yeah, well, nate knows us
better than anybody.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.810
Which means he knows
how we'll track him.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.078
And how to lose us.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.980
(beeping)
interesting.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.549
You got something?

13:37.551 --> 13:39.083
Eric:
Henrik vuksan.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.419
He's a high-level member
of omni we busted

13:41.421 --> 13:42.821
Two and a half years ago.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.155
He's doing time in chino.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.024
Yeah, they were after
that ricin vaccine.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.527
We took out some of their men
at that private race track.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.895
Eric: Apparently, alisa chambers
worked with henrik

13:50.897 --> 13:53.364
On a heist in madrid
five years ago.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.567
He got busted, she got away.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.936
If henrik's holding a grudge,
he may turn on her.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.472
Have kensi and deeks arrange
a transport to the boatshed.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.473
On it.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.410
If omni's involved,

14:05.412 --> 14:08.213
They'll sell that arsenal
to a terrorist cell

14:08.215 --> 14:09.914
With bad intentions,
or, worse,

14:09.916 --> 14:12.383
They grabbed callen
to seek revenge on us

14:12.385 --> 14:13.985
For killing their men.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.898
Oh, easy, big fella.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.500
Henrik vuksan.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.035
It's nice to
finally meet y...

14:31.037 --> 14:32.036
Shh...

14:32.038 --> 14:33.238
Wait a minute.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.607
You hear the two-
to three-foot waves,

14:35.609 --> 14:38.610
Offshore winds,

14:38.612 --> 14:41.412
Water's pushing
to about 70 degrees.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.281
It's a good day for a surf.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.016
That's pretty accurate.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.287
Henrik vuksan, you are
a known member of omni.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.855
Allegedly.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.422
Nah, it's actually
pretty well documented.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.292
Kensi:
Have you heard anything
on the horizon

14:54.294 --> 14:56.427
Dealing with omni's
movements on the outside?

14:56.429 --> 14:59.497
I haven't seen a horizon
in a long time, guys.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.032
Only prison walls.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.500
Is omni planning a strike?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.002
Any major plans?

15:04.004 --> 15:08.006
You guys are worried
about omni's revenge.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.341
You should be, okay?

15:10.343 --> 15:14.312
'cause at some point, just
when you think you're safe...

15:14.314 --> 15:15.914
So they are planning something.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.248
I do not know.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.250
'cause I'm in prison.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.252
Thanks to you guys, by the way.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.254
You're actually
locked up with members

15:23.256 --> 15:25.256
From each of the individual
groups that make up omni,

15:25.258 --> 15:26.391
So in all reality,

15:26.393 --> 15:27.926
You're probably
more well-connected now

15:27.928 --> 15:29.260
Than you were on the outside.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.396
Kensi: Yeah, so let me ask
you that question again.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.531
Is omni planning a strike?

15:33.533 --> 15:36.434
Henrik: Like I said,
great day for a surf.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.578
Hetty, you got
a minute?

15:47.580 --> 15:49.113
Of course.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.082
You gave nate
his current mission.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.550
Well, I've been known

15:52.552 --> 15:56.287
To, uh, dole out assignments
from time to time.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.488
Mmm.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.291
Full disclosure.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.427
Have you been
in contact with him?

16:02.429 --> 16:05.096
I know you have your methods.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.231
Did you see any warning signs?

16:08.668 --> 16:11.102
You think nate is
in over his head.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.271
I want to know
if nate turned wolf,

16:13.273 --> 16:15.740
If he's taking
unnecessary chances,

16:15.742 --> 16:18.309
Specifically with callen's life.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.312
Every agent develops
differently.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.983
Callen, you, kensi.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.985
You're not gonna tell me.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.453
Okay.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.722
I tried...

16:32.125 --> 16:33.491
...To lure him out,

16:33.493 --> 16:36.494
But he's enamored
by this femme fatale.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.396
So why not force him out?

16:38.398 --> 16:41.532
Well, it'd be very dangerous.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.402
Faith.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.006
And sometimes things
just need to play out.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.208
Or you put the fire out
before it starts.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.213
Where are
you going?

16:55.215 --> 16:56.547
Nate's place.

16:56.549 --> 17:00.184
Maybe there's something there
that can help us.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.465
(coughs)

17:15.502 --> 17:17.435
Memory jogged?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.671
Thank you.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.740
I was actually feeling
a little dehydrated.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.244
Maybe you were wrong.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.712
Maybe he doesn't know.
No, he knows.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.548
He can just be a bit of a
problem child, that's all.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.750
Hey, come on, callen, let it go.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.285
It's not worth it.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.721
I don't know anything
about jd-x,

17:36.722 --> 17:39.156
And you know more than anybody,
if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.159
I read the file.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.160
I know you and sam designed
the jd-x security protocol.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.496
That's interesting.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.465
'cause you don't have
that level of clearance.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.468
Who are you getting your
information from, nate, huh?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.370
This isn't about me.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.539
This is about you.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.511
Okay, I'll tell you what I know.

18:00.513 --> 18:04.649
I know for a fact that wasn't
spring water in that bottle.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.585
Maybe distilled, possibly tap.
Not really sure.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.757
We thought you might
respond like that.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.461
So if you don't tell us
where to find the jd-x,

18:16.463 --> 18:19.831
My associate is gonna hurt
one of these innocent people

18:19.833 --> 18:23.301
And another and keep
doing it until you do.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.303
There's one thing I
know about you, callen,

18:25.305 --> 18:26.637
Is that you fear
being responsible

18:26.639 --> 18:28.239
For an innocent
person's suffering.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.708
I mean, it's what makes
you a good agent, right?

18:30.710 --> 18:31.876
Alisa:
Easy call.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.580
I hope she's worth it.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.888
They're made and stored
at vertadyne technologies.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.691
It's a civilian
contractor in mid-city.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.660
How do we get it?

18:51.664 --> 18:54.665
If there's a security risk,
vertadyne protocol is

18:54.667 --> 18:57.869
To move the explosives in small
batches to another facility.

18:57.871 --> 19:00.238
So that's the optimal time
to strike.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.240
Yes.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.308
Now call off your man.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.177
Knife.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.724
After we secure the jd-x.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.763
Call in the threat.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.439
Since when do you
keep food here?

19:35.441 --> 19:37.542
Uh, since it started
disappearing at the house.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.544
Oh.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.563
Oh, how old is that?

19:41.564 --> 19:43.581
This is a day older than
none of your business.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.449
Yeah, fair enough,
but I'm pretty sure

19:45.451 --> 19:47.685
It's not supposed
to look furry.
What?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.353
Um...

19:49.355 --> 19:50.655
(sniffs)
oh.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.690
That's gross.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.824
Throw it out.

19:53.826 --> 19:54.892
Ugh.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.927
So what do we think?

19:55.929 --> 19:58.863
Can we end
this guy's vacation?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.632
I know that look.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.900
What's going on with you?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.368
What are you
thinking?

20:07.807 --> 20:09.974
I'm starting to get
worried about callen.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.876
Shoot, nah, callen can
take care of himself.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.544
I'd be more worried about nate

20:13.546 --> 20:15.346
And his power of self-deception.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.581
What do you mean? How so?

20:16.583 --> 20:17.682
When you go this deep,

20:17.684 --> 20:19.150
You got to convince yourself

20:19.151 --> 20:20.617
Before you convince
anybody else, right?

20:20.620 --> 20:22.320
Nate's a master
of the psyche,

20:22.322 --> 20:24.956
So he's gonna go deeper.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.791
Which means
if this thing goes bad,

20:26.793 --> 20:29.493
It's gonna be
disastrous.

20:29.495 --> 20:30.661
Living the lie.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.297
The longer it goes,
the worse it gets.

20:33.299 --> 20:35.299
Yeah. How do you know
when to drop it?

20:35.301 --> 20:36.767
Well, unfortunately,
that's the problem,

20:36.769 --> 20:38.903
Is you don't.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.638
I just keep thinking that nate
doesn't have all of the pieces

20:40.640 --> 20:42.840
And so he's just
jammed until he does.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.980
At least that's what I'm hoping.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.248
Yeah.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.551
¶ ¶

21:08.534 --> 21:09.767
What happened to you, nate?

21:28.755 --> 21:30.821
¶ ¶

21:43.836 --> 21:44.902
Oh.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.787
Nell:
You can run,
but you can't hide.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.859
Gotcha.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.795
(phone buzzes)

22:10.797 --> 22:11.996
Go, nell.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.964
We just got a match
on the van's plates

22:13.966 --> 22:15.499
Through a city crime
surveillance cam.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.867
Where?

22:16.869 --> 22:18.602
Mid-city.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.504
Mid-city...

22:20.506 --> 22:22.640
There's a vertadyne facility
in mid-city.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.575
They manufacture
jd-x explosives.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.010
Military grade.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.845
Coincidence?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.380
Considering secnav had
callen and me consult

22:29.382 --> 22:30.715
On their security protocol,
I doubt it.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.450
That's got to be the target.

22:32.452 --> 22:33.884
Track that van
and send me the feed.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.453
Yep.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.023
You're sure this is it?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.691
You don't trust me?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.826
Nate:
Nah, he wouldn't play

22:41.828 --> 22:43.611
With other people's lives.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.395
That's the thing about
wearing the white hat.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.731
When lives are
on the line,

22:46.733 --> 22:47.865
There's no margin
for error.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.368
Hey, hold up, there.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.369
No casualties.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.370
You were right
about this one.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.905
Thinks he runs the world.

22:54.907 --> 22:58.976
Those jd-x loads are
equipped with trackers.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.111
Anything goes wrong--

23:00.113 --> 23:01.712
Like, let's say,
a hijacking--

23:01.714 --> 23:02.847
You get caught

23:02.849 --> 23:04.815
Before you hit the 405.

23:04.817 --> 23:05.950
I can get you the jd-x

23:05.952 --> 23:07.485
And I can disable
the trackers,

23:07.487 --> 23:09.754
But no casualties.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.422
Okay.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.057
But it'd better work.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.495
Right on time.

23:20.466 --> 23:21.732
Man:
Go.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.401
We have a visual. Stand by.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.402
Man:
Copy that.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.669
Standing by.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.174
Make it fast.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.676
I need my badge and my gun.

23:35.815 --> 23:36.981
Get creative.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.025
Federal agent!

23:48.027 --> 23:50.561
I need to confiscate
this truck.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.829
Abort omega protocol.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.565
Verification alpha-charlie-zulu.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.636
Request to abort omega protocol.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.838
Verification alpha-charlie-zulu.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.939
Dispatch:
Stand by.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.108
Request verified.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.877
Release to agent callen.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.054
All yours, agent callen.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.656
Just walk away.
I'll take it from here.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.112
¶ ¶

24:56.796 --> 24:58.963
Callen:
And another tracker.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.001
I'll take care of those.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.903
That's all of them.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.238
Good.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.240
It's been fun.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

25:10.076 --> 25:11.609
What are you doing?

25:11.611 --> 25:13.110
You don't just
put a bullet

25:13.112 --> 25:14.512
In a guy like this.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.213
His friends will find him

25:16.215 --> 25:18.015
And then they'll find us.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.050
A guy like this

25:20.052 --> 25:21.218
Has to disappear.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.987
And that means disposal.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.789
Piece by piece, if necessary,

25:25.791 --> 25:27.558
And that takes time.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.260
The kind of time
that makes us

25:29.262 --> 25:31.028
Miss the exchange.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.596
(sniffs)

25:32.598 --> 25:34.765
He comes with us.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.135
You're going to be good at this.

25:40.206 --> 25:43.274
I'll drive.

25:43.276 --> 25:45.910
You two keep an eye
on our friend.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.578
Come on. Let's go.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.563
¶ ¶

26:13.639 --> 26:15.005
(grunting)

26:18.878 --> 26:20.878
Leave him!

26:20.880 --> 26:21.979
Nell:
Sam, the van

26:21.981 --> 26:23.047
Is approaching your position,

26:23.049 --> 26:24.648
Headed south on union.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.716
I got him.

26:28.621 --> 26:29.920
Unbelievable.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.922
Guy just doesn't get it.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.058
Tried to slip me a tracker.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.795
Guess he doesn't know you
like I do.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.365
Nell:
<i> 50 yards and closing.</i>

26:41.367 --> 26:42.366
(engine starts)

26:42.368 --> 26:43.701
Granger:
Stand down, sam.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.035
Repeat. Stand down.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.670
Granger, are you crazy?

26:46.672 --> 26:48.739
Let them go.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.775
I don't believe this.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.644
Granger:
<i> Just trust me.</i>

26:53.646 --> 26:55.279
Nell:
<i> Okay, I've got</i>
<i> a visual on callen.</i>

26:55.281 --> 26:56.747
<i> He managed to escape.</i>

26:56.749 --> 26:59.350
<i> Head north on union.</i>

26:59.352 --> 27:02.319
Sam:
<i> I'll pick him up.</i>

27:02.321 --> 27:04.655
Granger:
<i> I'm coming to you.</i>

27:17.103 --> 27:18.769
You good?

27:18.771 --> 27:20.838
Better than him.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.977
Here comes granger.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.125
Sam:
Are we really gonna
let them go,

27:41.127 --> 27:42.126
Just like that?

27:42.128 --> 27:43.360
That's exactly what we're doing.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.728
Unbelievable.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.030
Listen, there's
a bigger picture here.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.164
Nate's onto something.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.899
We need to let
it play out.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.668
We stop them now,
we've got nothing.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.369
So, first, we give them
an arsenal of weapons.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.238
And then we handed them
enough explosives

27:54.240 --> 27:55.673
To take down a building.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.107
We're not even certain
if we can track 'em.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.342
You were up close.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.443
Where's his head?

27:59.445 --> 28:01.712
I'm sure that alisa
will kill him

28:01.714 --> 28:03.347
If she even begins to suspect
that he's not legit.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.249
And I think that nate knows that

28:05.251 --> 28:06.750
And he's gonna play it out
to the end.

28:06.752 --> 28:09.353
I just... Can't be sure.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.954
Granger:
So is nate going method,

28:10.956 --> 28:13.290
Or is he just gone?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.692
If we're wrong,

28:14.694 --> 28:16.694
A lot of people
are going to die.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.996
Granger:
Well, at least this will force
their hand into moving faster.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.465
That's when mistakes happen.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.233
We're running out of time.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.335
Those explosives could disappear
at any moment.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.104
Yeah, she's wearing
a scrambler on her wrist.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.273
I pointed it out to nate
before I slipped him a tracker.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.407
Well, let's hope
he uses it for help

28:33.245 --> 28:34.244
And not for a wild goose chase.

28:34.245 --> 28:35.244
Let's check with kensi
and deeks at the boatshed.

28:35.247 --> 28:36.480
Maybe they're having
better luck.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.749
Go on ahead. I got this.

28:41.787 --> 28:43.187
Kensi:
<i> Quit stalling, henrik.</i>

28:43.189 --> 28:45.823
For the last time,
I got nothing to say, guys.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.141
Come on.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.458
I see you have
an affinity for the water.

28:48.461 --> 28:50.828
And the feds--
that's us--

28:50.830 --> 28:53.497
We have a bunch of
different prison facilities

28:53.499 --> 28:55.332
Up and down the coast.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.201
We could probably make
a few phone calls,

28:57.203 --> 28:59.236
See if we could find
some vacancy for you.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.071
You can do that?

29:01.073 --> 29:03.273
New location, new identity,

29:03.275 --> 29:04.775
A view of the horizon...

29:04.777 --> 29:06.110
Deeks:
Paradise.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.479
Kensi:
I mean, that's fed
power for you.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.514
Deeks:
So you got
a couple options.

29:13.085 --> 29:16.954
You can either tell us
what we need to know, or...

29:16.956 --> 29:19.757
Or we could just send you back
to your current facility

29:19.759 --> 29:21.959
And, you know,
maybe even tell your roommates

29:21.961 --> 29:23.427
How much you
helped us out.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.028
You'd label me a snitch.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.130
Hmm.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.368
Well, you're right
about one thing.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.903
There is chatter of

29:32.905 --> 29:34.238
Something big going down,

29:34.240 --> 29:35.539
But it ain't omni.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.474
Okay. Do tell.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.810
(sighs)

29:39.812 --> 29:41.545
What you're dealing with
is a local problem.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.514
Okay?

29:43.516 --> 29:47.117
You got the triads, the
armenians and the molina cartel,

29:47.119 --> 29:50.087
And they're pooling
all their resources.

29:50.089 --> 29:54.358
Something big is bringing
the heads of all the groups out.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.227
Something about heavy, uh...

29:57.229 --> 29:58.395
Heavy artillery.

29:58.397 --> 29:59.963
Jd-x explosives.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.966
Mm-hmm.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.370
What does alisa chambers
have to do with all this?

30:06.372 --> 30:10.374
Whatever they want,
the black widow shall deliver.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.042
Expect a body count.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.477
Because she kills her crews?

30:13.479 --> 30:15.345
Dead men can't betray.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.816
Her kiss is the last
thing you'll see.

30:18.818 --> 30:19.950
So who's the target?

30:19.952 --> 30:21.451
It's not a target, it's a sale.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.787
Who's the buyer?

30:23.788 --> 30:26.122
Foreigners, from what
I could put together.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.859
Whoever they are,
I'm sure they're not nice.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.872
(clears throat)

30:41.874 --> 30:46.076
Leaders of the triads, armenian
mafia, the molina cartel--

30:46.078 --> 30:49.279
Those guys have been
untouchable for years.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.614
Yeah, that's all we need

30:50.616 --> 30:52.116
Is these guys getting
their hands on the jd-x.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.617
Yeah, they can sell it
to the highest bidder.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.452
Or, even worse, they can
keep it for themselves.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.187
Too greedy.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.590
These guys will turn on each
other the first chance they get.

30:59.592 --> 31:02.392
And the body count rises.
Callen: Granger's right.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.862
If these guys surface, it's
gonna be a major opportunity

31:04.864 --> 31:06.396
To cripple their organizations.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.302
¶ ¶

31:18.444 --> 31:20.444
What are we doing?

31:20.446 --> 31:23.113
Making the exchange.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.349
You should have told me
there was a change in location.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.484
Sorry, sweetie, you don't
get to know everything.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.654
Hi. It's me.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.522
Man: Go ahead.
Plan's changed.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.025
It's in our possession, but it
has to be today or no deal.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.193
Copy that.
45 minutes.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.361
I'll text you
the location.

31:37.363 --> 31:38.362
Okay.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.563
Why here?

31:39.565 --> 31:41.431
Like you said,
those guys are good.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.300
Timeline's got pushed.

31:43.302 --> 31:46.270
One mistake with this jd-x
will cause this refinery

31:46.272 --> 31:48.272
To destroy three city blocks.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.274
For an outlaw,
you sure do care a lot

31:50.276 --> 31:51.975
About people you don't know.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.610
I care about us.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.580
The plan was to get rich,
not die.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.549
You need to keep me
in the loop so I can help you.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.697
All right, no more secrets.

32:22.675 --> 32:23.707
(beeping)

32:23.709 --> 32:24.708
Got something.

32:24.710 --> 32:25.642
What?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.477
Nell:
It's a jd-x beacon.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.979
That's east l.A.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.414
(sighs)

32:30.416 --> 32:31.715
Surveillance dead zone.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.951
Nell:
Yeah.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.087
Granger:
It's nate.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.422
It's the tracker
callen mentioned.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.656
Mobilize the team.

32:39.658 --> 32:40.624
Yeah.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.693
Pray it's not a trap.

32:56.141 --> 32:59.209
¶ ¶

33:07.486 --> 33:09.486
Alisa: Looks like the party's
getting started.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.355
Nate:
You sure we can trust them?

33:11.357 --> 33:13.357
Alisa:
We're about to find out.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.525
Almost home.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.370
Gentlemen.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.171
Man:
Let's see the merchandise.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.650
I'm impressed
you pulled it off.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.754
The money?

33:45.324 --> 33:46.256
Give me a minute.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.262
Ids confirmed. Take 'em.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.530
Move in.

33:54.800 --> 33:55.699
Sam:
Federal agents! Everybody down!

33:55.701 --> 33:57.034
On the ground now!

33:57.036 --> 33:58.468
Let's see your hands!

33:58.470 --> 34:00.070
Don't move!
Get down now!

34:00.072 --> 34:01.772
Federal agents!
On your knees!

34:01.774 --> 34:04.174
Stay down! Stay down!
You're in the crosshairs!

34:04.176 --> 34:05.475
Down!
Hands behind your back!

34:05.477 --> 34:07.411
Don't move!

34:16.822 --> 34:19.189
You know, there was a moment
you almost had me convinced.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.190
Drop your weapon.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.224
It's over.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.793
You still don't get it!

34:22.795 --> 34:24.628
In!

34:24.630 --> 34:26.430
Close the door!

34:29.501 --> 34:31.501
I have a shot!
Do not take the shot.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.970
Granger:
Do not shoot that van.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.438
The explosives will
blow us all to hell.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.375
They're on the move.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.377
Callen, sam, go.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.312
We got these guys.

34:44.383 --> 34:45.582
(tires screeching)

35:10.375 --> 35:11.842
(guns firing)

35:11.844 --> 35:13.443
Granger:
Do not shoot that van.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.511
Nate's still inside.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.228
I got him.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.768
Sam:
Jump in the trunk!

35:38.770 --> 35:40.604
(guns firing)

35:40.606 --> 35:41.671
Sam:
I got nate.

35:41.673 --> 35:42.806
Finish it.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.717
Everyone good?

35:53.719 --> 35:55.785
Sam:
Yeah. All good, g.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.525
¶ ¶

36:18.810 --> 36:20.644
What the hell were you thinking?

36:20.646 --> 36:22.913
I lost control.

36:22.915 --> 36:24.481
You're lucky to be alive.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.450
(sighs)

36:27.452 --> 36:30.320
Look, I get why you did it.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.290
You got too deep.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.559
And I almost got us killed
trying to prove myself.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.495
That's just it,
you don't have to.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.730
You're already
a part of this team.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.300
But this team doesn't work
if we don't trust each other.

36:45.437 --> 36:46.736
I guess I have a lot to learn.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.606
No, look, we all do.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.541
That never changes.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.914
That was a crazy day.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.449
Buy you dinner
to celebrate?

36:59.451 --> 37:01.451
Yeah, just a second.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.586
What are you doing?

37:02.588 --> 37:05.288
Nothing. Nothing.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.990
Yeah, uh, jamaican?

37:06.992 --> 37:08.692
You want to get jamaican?
'cause that sounds pretty tasty.

37:08.694 --> 37:09.693
Okay.

37:09.695 --> 37:12.262
Did you just send me an e-mail?

37:12.264 --> 37:13.630
No. What did I send?

37:13.632 --> 37:15.115
What's this?

37:15.116 --> 37:16.599
Video?
No, don't watch that.
Don't watch that.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.535
Don't watch the video.
No, no, no, no, no!
What's that?

37:18.537 --> 37:19.536
Stop! Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

37:19.538 --> 37:22.639
(laughs)

37:22.641 --> 37:24.307
Care to explain?

37:24.309 --> 37:26.309
Deeks: Uh, yeah, I can explain,
I set up a webcam to see

37:26.311 --> 37:28.578
Who was crushing my leftovers,
and it turns out to be...

37:28.580 --> 37:30.013
You.
Me.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.514
You weren't even
gonna say anything.

37:31.516 --> 37:32.515
I was gonna say something.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.034
I literally just saw...

37:34.035 --> 37:35.552
I didn't even know that
I sleptwalked until I...

37:35.554 --> 37:36.886
You should apologize.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.421
What is that?

37:38.423 --> 37:40.257
What?

37:40.259 --> 37:41.591
When I found the container
this morning,

37:41.593 --> 37:42.892
It was in the fridge.
So?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.594
So in this video, I just
left it on the counter.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.029
How does it get
back in the fridge?

37:46.031 --> 37:48.398
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.789
No! Aah!
Don't you...

37:49.790 --> 37:51.179
Give it back.
Give it, deeks.
Stop it. Stop it.

37:51.180 --> 37:52.569
Give it back, give it...
Who is that? Who is that?!

37:52.571 --> 37:53.670
(gasps)

37:53.672 --> 37:56.539
Deeks:
Oh... My god.

37:56.541 --> 38:01.344
You're eating the leftovers
of my sleepwalking leftovers.

38:01.346 --> 38:02.679
Okay.
You care to explain this?

38:02.681 --> 38:04.714
Okay, you know how much
I love loco moco.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.716
It was calling my
name. It really was.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.785
I was sleeping,
and I heard it call my name.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.720
It was like, "kensi!"
I can't believe you.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.789
I... No. Okay. Wait. Wait.
Wait, wait.
I don't even know
who you are.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.291
Wait, wait.
No wonder I'm
stressed out.

38:14.293 --> 38:15.625
The love of my life is
like a loco moco hyena.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.027
Kensi: Wait,
seriously, look at me.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.428
I'm telling the truth.
Look back! Come here!

38:20.532 --> 38:22.666
It was messy.

38:22.668 --> 38:26.002
But nate got it done.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.405
Something we haven't
been able to do.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.709
Well, messy's good.

38:32.711 --> 38:36.012
Gives you a chance
to appreciate the clean.

38:36.014 --> 38:39.082
It was a huge gamble.

38:39.084 --> 38:42.585
Is it really a gamble...
If you don't lose?

38:44.556 --> 38:45.855
Oh, nate's growing.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.857
He's going to be good.

38:47.859 --> 38:52.762
But in this business,
"good" gets you killed,

38:52.764 --> 38:56.333
So I need him to be elite.

38:56.335 --> 38:58.802
"elite" takes time.

38:58.804 --> 39:01.438
Sam: And reps.
Hetty: Exactly.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.774
Don't get it twisted.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.843
(whispering):
I've done this before.

39:16.655 --> 39:19.122
I, uh, I owe you an apology.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.523
Just a promise.

39:21.927 --> 39:25.128
You'll never do anything
that stupid again.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.866
Even though your heart was
in the right place,

39:29.868 --> 39:31.468
You endangered lives.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.636
That's not
what we do.

39:33.638 --> 39:36.373
You got lucky.

39:37.709 --> 39:42.445
But sometimes being lucky
is better than being good.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.594
Hmm.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.062
Quite a day, huh?

39:59.064 --> 40:01.030
Understatement of the year.

40:01.032 --> 40:05.034
There are three major
criminal organizations

40:05.036 --> 40:07.437
That are crippled,

40:07.439 --> 40:10.974
And the vacuum of power
may very well destroy them.

40:14.513 --> 40:18.982
Moving forward, there's
a system in place for a reason.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.850
Use it.

40:20.852 --> 40:24.854
No more lone wolf.

40:24.856 --> 40:28.458
Or don't you remember
saying that to mr. Callen?

40:30.529 --> 40:33.863
I don't know, just...

40:33.865 --> 40:36.933
Maybe I'm not ready for this.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.604
You've never been more ready.

40:45.877 --> 40:50.814
<i> Now your real training begins.</i>
