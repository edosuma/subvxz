- HEY, HOW'D EVERYTHING GO
WITH THE BRATS THIS MORNING?

07:44.290 --> 07:46.599
- OH, FANTASTIC.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.520
THEY'RE DOING THEIR PUNISHMENT
AS WE SPEAK.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.084
- AH.
- STOP IT!

07:50.190 --> 07:52.249
NO, IT'S--STOP!

07:52.360 --> 07:54.089
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT, HUH?
- HEY!

07:54.190 --> 07:55.748
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

07:55.850 --> 07:56.885
- IT'S KIND OF OKAY,
BUT I TOLD 'EM

07:56.990 --> 07:58.503
THEY HAD TO SPEND
THE AFTERNOON CLEANING.

07:58.610 --> 07:59.770
- YOURS IS ALL WET.

07:59.890 --> 08:01.505
- THERE'S NOTHING IN THE HOUSE
THAT'S NOT CLEAN.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.713
- WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

08:02.820 --> 08:04.162
- CLEANING GIVES ME
A SENSE OF CALM.

08:04.270 --> 08:05.373
- YES, OF COURSE.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.196
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE 'EM
SOMETHING TO DO?

08:06.310 --> 08:08.130
- I GOT IT.
I GOT IT, BABE.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.276
HEY, STOP IT.
- STOP.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.301
- SET 'EM DOWN,
ON THE GROUND.

08:11.420 --> 08:12.444
SET 'EM DOWN.
LET'S GO.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.278
- WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

08:17.350 --> 08:22.310
- NOW WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE.

08:22.430 --> 08:24.637
- NO, THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

08:24.740 --> 08:27.186
- SHE'S THE PROBLEM.
- QUIET, QUIET, QUIET.

08:27.290 --> 08:29.804
NOW YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME
THERE'S BEEN SOME FIGHTING,

08:29.920 --> 08:31.501
SOME SCREAMING AND YELLING,

08:31.610 --> 08:33.009
AND DISRESPECTING
YOUR ELDERS,

08:33.130 --> 08:37.578
AND A PRONOUNCED LACK
OF GOOD OLD AMERICAN WORK ETHIC.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.641
DON'T LOOK AT HER.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.546
SHE'S LEAVING.
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE HERE.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.277
SHE'S GONE.

08:43.380 --> 08:44.472
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
LEAVE US HERE?

08:44.590 --> 08:45.511
- THAT'S OUR PUNISHMENT?

08:45.620 --> 08:47.440
- WELL, YOUR GRANDPA
HAS SOME CHORES

08:47.560 --> 08:48.629
HE'D LIKE YOU
TO HELP OUT WITH.

08:48.730 --> 08:50.482
AND HIS CHORES,
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE

08:50.590 --> 08:51.454
A LOT LONGER
THAN MY CHORES.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.664
- OH, YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

08:53.770 --> 08:56.318
WE'LL SEE YOU AT 1700 HOURS,
ALL RIGHT?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.488
RIGHT THIS WAY, TROOPS.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.329
[needle clicks on record]

09:01.430 --> 09:02.704
- ALL RIGHT.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.223
[Joni Mitchell's Help Me]

09:06.330 --> 09:08.298
RIGHT?
- THIS IS IT, YEAH.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.812
- THIS IS AN ALBUM
RIGHT HERE, OKAY.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.478
JONI KNOWS HOW
TO LIFT YOU UP

09:12.580 --> 09:14.263
AND TEAR YOU DOWN,
ALL AT ONCE.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.540
AND WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SKIP

09:15.650 --> 09:17.379
THE SONG AFTER THIS ONE,
'CAUSE IT MAKES ME CRY.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.653
- OH, SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.864
LISTEN, DREW, THIS MUSIC
IS POWERFUL STUFF.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.039
AND I GUARANTEE YOU
IT IS GONNA TAKE YOU

09:23.140 --> 09:25.415
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
WITH THIS GIRL, ALL RIGHT?

09:25.530 --> 09:26.485
- YEAH.
- OH, MY GOD.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.669
I CAN'T DO IT, MAN.

09:27.770 --> 09:28.737
I CAN'T DO IT, ADAM.
I QUIT.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.139
_ THIS OLIVER ROME GUY,
HE'S DEFEATED ME.

09:32.260 --> 09:35.388
WITH THE PORK PIE HAT
AND THE JETHRO TULL LOOK,

09:35.500 --> 09:36.910
I CAN'T DO IT.
- HANG IN THERE.

09:37.020 --> 09:38.089
- WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

09:38.190 --> 09:40.602
WHY ARE YOU GUYS LISTENING
TO JONI MITCHELL?

09:40.710 --> 09:42.268
- BECAUSE SHE'S A GENIUS,
FIRST OF ALL.

09:42.370 --> 09:43.712
OKAY?
- OH, UH-HUH.

09:43.820 --> 09:45.856
- AND OUR NEPHEW CAME IN HERE
FOR A LITTLE ADVICE.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.815
NOT JUST ON MUSIC, BUT ON
THE FEMALE OF THE SPECIES.

09:48.930 --> 09:49.783
AND HE CAME TO ME,
NOT YOU.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.130
SO I'D APPRECIATE IT IF--
- REALLY?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.753
YOU WANTED HIS ADVICE?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.304
- THERE'S A GIRL I LIKE
WHO LIKES JONI MITCHELL,

09:54.420 --> 09:56.479
SO I'M TRYING
TO LISTEN TO IT.

09:56.590 --> 09:57.932
BUT I KNOW THIS IS STUPID.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.452
SHE'S NOT GONNA BELIEVE
THAT I'M INTO THIS, OBVIOUSLY.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.936
- DREW, DREW,
LISTEN TO ME, OKAY.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.907
YOU'RE AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE
WITH THIS YOUNG LADY, OKAY?

10:05.010 --> 10:07.046
RIGHT NOW, SHE'S SEE YOU
AS HER FRIEND, OKAY?

10:07.150 --> 10:09.015
YOU GOT A VERY SMALL WINDOW
TO BREAK THROUGH

10:09.120 --> 10:12.112
THE FRIEND ZONE
AND INTO THE FUN ZONE.

10:12.230 --> 10:14.812
- IN THE LAYIN' PIPE ZONE.
- OKAY.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.194
- LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS.
- I'VE GOT THIS.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.098
- YOU ACTUALLY ARE MAKING
A GOOD POINT, SHOCKINGLY.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.781
- LISTEN TO ME.
WITH TRACK NINE,

10:20.890 --> 10:23.302
I SWEAR TO YOU,
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

10:23.410 --> 10:25.025
- ALL RIGHT.
- ANYTHING.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.448
- I'M HOLDING MY BREATH.
- LOOK.

10:26.550 --> 10:28.825
I DATED A GIRL FOR A YEAR
AND PRETENDED I WAS VEGAN,

10:28.930 --> 10:29.794
SO I'M IN NO POSITION
TO JUDGE.

10:29.900 --> 10:32.061
BUT, I DO HAVE
ONE PIECE OF ADVICE.

10:32.180 --> 10:33.727
- I KNOW. IF SHE DOESN'T
LIKE ME FOR ME,

10:33.840 --> 10:34.932
THEN WHAT'S THE POINT?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.450
- NO, THAT WOULD BE
TERRIBLE ADVICE.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.004
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, YOU HAVE
GOT TO COMMIT TO THIS LIE.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.076
- IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE A LIE.

10:40.190 --> 10:41.669
- YOU CAN'T JUST LISTEN
TO A COUPLE OF TRACKS

10:41.770 --> 10:43.522
OFF THIS ALBUM AND THINK
YOU'RE GONNA PULL IT OFF.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.016
YOU'VE GOTTA WORK FOR IT.

10:45.120 --> 10:45.870
YOU GOTTA READ
THE LINER NOTES.

10:45.990 --> 10:46.422
YOU GOTTA KNOW
WHAT THAT SONG--

10:46.540 --> 10:48.565
- YO, YO, HEY.

10:48.680 --> 10:52.195
OH, JONI. TRACK NINE--
BONE ZONE, EVERY TIME.

10:52.300 --> 10:55.849
UM, WE NEED YOU DOWNSTAIRS,
'CAUSE YOU GOTTA

10:55.960 --> 10:56.927
PUSH THE RED BUTTON
OR WHATEVER.

10:57.030 --> 10:58.019
I MEAN,
I COULD PROBABLY DO IT,

10:58.140 --> 10:59.300
BUT I MEAN,
YOU'RE THE ENGINEER, RIGHT?

10:59.410 --> 11:00.616
IS THAT HOW THAT WORKS?
- YEAH, I'LL...

11:00.720 --> 11:01.618
- YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
COME DO THAT.

11:01.730 --> 11:02.822
- GO PULL THEM LEVERS.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.342
COME ON.

11:07.350 --> 11:09.864
- AND AS FOR THE BATHROOMS,
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

11:09.970 --> 11:11.073
I WAS ALSO LOOKING UP

11:11.180 --> 11:13.523
"DELUXE PORTA POTTIES"
ON THE INTERNET.

11:13.630 --> 11:14.312
- [snickers]
THAT'S NOT A CATEGORY.

11:14.430 --> 11:15.385
- IT IS, OH, YEAH.
- NO, NO.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.115
- VERY, VERY LUSH.
YOU'LL SEE.

11:17.220 --> 11:20.223
- OXYMORON--
"DELUXE PORTA POTTY."

11:20.330 --> 11:22.639
- LISTEN, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?

11:22.750 --> 11:23.535
- GOOD. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR?

11:23.640 --> 11:25.676
- OH, GOD.
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

11:25.780 --> 11:26.951
SOMETHING BILLOWY.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.812
SOMETHING WITH ROOM
FOR MY EATING HABITS.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.330
- HEY, WHO'S HIS BEST MAN
GONNA BE?

11:30.440 --> 11:31.236
- UM, I DON'T KNOW.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.900
WE HAVEN'T REALLY
TALKED ABOUT IT YET.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.752
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW,
HONESTLY,

11:35.860 --> 11:38.135
HOW MUCH OF THAT STUFF
WE'RE GONNA REALLY DO,

11:38.240 --> 11:39.992
LIKE, THE TRADITIONAL,
YOU KNOW--

11:40.110 --> 11:41.099
- BUT YOU'RE--RIGHT,
BUT YOU'RE HAVING A WEDDING,

11:41.210 --> 11:42.245
SO THAT'S TRADITIONAL, SO--
- YEAH.

11:42.350 --> 11:46.389
- AND SO NONE OF HIS FAMILY
IS COMING?

11:46.490 --> 11:47.309
- UH, I DON'T THINK SO.

11:47.430 --> 11:49.807
- HM.
- YEAH, I DON'T--

11:49.910 --> 11:51.138
- I WAS JUST LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING--

11:51.260 --> 11:53.842
I JUST--I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I KNOW HIM THAT WELL.

11:53.950 --> 11:54.735
- I HAVEN'T MET THEM EITHER.
I DON'T KNOW.

11:54.850 --> 11:56.636
HE'S NOT CLOSE WITH THEM,
YOU KNOW.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.638
I THINK THERE'S SOME
COMPLICATED ISSUES THERE.

11:58.750 --> 12:02.334
AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY NOT
THE HEALTHIEST RELATIONSHIP.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.577
AND I THINK HE JUST WANTS
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.160
- AREN'T YOU CURIOUS?
- TO BE HONEST,

12:06.270 --> 12:07.999
IT'S KIND OF A SENSITIVE SUBJECT
WITH HIM.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.749
AND I JUST DON'T REALLY
WANNA PUSH IT.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.420
AND I DON'T KNOW,
I TRUST HIM, YOU KNOW.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.932
I'M SURE HE WILL SHARE WITH ME
THE RIGHT THINGS.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.315
AND NOT EVERYBODY'S THAT CLOSE
TO THEIR FAMILY.

12:17.420 --> 12:18.318
AND I THINK IT'S--
IT MAKES SENSE, YOU KNOW?

12:18.420 --> 12:20.627
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A GOOD THING WITH HIM,

12:20.740 --> 12:21.900
YOU WOULDN'T WANT HIM THERE.

12:22.010 --> 12:25.252
- RIGHT, OR IT WOULD BE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO--

12:25.360 --> 12:29.012
ANYWAY, I HEAR YOU.
- MOM, THIS IS NOT THERAPY 101.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.326
- I UNDERSTAND.
- OKAY, GOT IT, THANK YOU.

12:30.430 --> 12:34.912
DULY NOTED, YOUR ATTITUDE
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.338
- WELL, A WEDDING BRINGS
THESE QUESTIONS UP, DOESN'T IT?

12:36.440 --> 12:38.328
- APPARENTLY.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.618
- MADE YOU SOME COFFEE.
- AW.

12:46.730 --> 12:47.754
THAN KS.

12:47.870 --> 12:48.859
ARE YOU JUST PRACT ICING
BEING A WIFE?

12:48.970 --> 12:50.551
- YEAH, JUST PRACT ICING.

12:50.660 --> 12:52.173
[grunts]

12:52.280 --> 12:57.832
UM...HEY.
SO, YOU KNOW, UM...

12:57.940 --> 13:02.047
MY DAD IS, LIKE,
REALLY NOT THE BEST.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.048
HE'S, LIKE,
KIND OF THE WORST.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.709
I DON'T EVEN REALLY
LIKE HIM AS A PERSON.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.435
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE'S MY DAD,

13:09.540 --> 13:10.643
AND HE'S A BIG PART OF ME.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.024
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT
TO ME THAT HE'S THERE

13:12.130 --> 13:15.019
ON THE BIGGEST DAY
OF MY LIFE, YOU KNOW?

13:15.130 --> 13:17.371
- THAT'S GREAT.
I'M HAPPY.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.856
THAT'S GREAT.

13:18.970 --> 13:20.130
I LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING HIM.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.059
- OKAY.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.138
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT--

13:23.250 --> 13:24.478
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

13:24.590 --> 13:27.457
- OKAY, WELL, IT FEELS
IMPORTANT TO ME THAT,

13:27.560 --> 13:30.176
YOU KNOW, YOUR FAMILY KNOWS ME
AND THAT I KNOW THEM, AND--

13:30.290 --> 13:32.667
- AND I'M GONNA INTRODUCE YOU
TO THEM AT SOME POINT.

13:32.770 --> 13:33.498
I JUST THINK OUR WEDDING
IS SUPPOSED TO BE

13:33.600 --> 13:35.352
THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF OUR LIVES.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.917
AND IF MY STEPDAD COMES TO THAT,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE.

13:38.020 --> 13:40.818
SO THEY'RE NOT COMING.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.364
- OKAY, WELL,
DOES THAT MEAN THAT--

13:42.470 --> 13:45.098
THAT YOU MOM CAN'T COME THEN,
BECAUSE OF HIM?

13:45.200 --> 13:47.953
- YEAH, PROBABLY.
- OKAY.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.948
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR REAL DAD?
I MEAN--

13:50.070 --> 13:53.540
- I TOLD YOU,
HE'S NOT AROUND.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.412
- OKAY, WELL, DO YOU WANNA
AT LEAST, YOU KNOW,

13:55.520 --> 13:56.202
LET HIM KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?

13:56.310 --> 13:59.382
- NO, HE'S, LIKE--
HE'S DEAD.

13:59.490 --> 14:03.039
HE'S NOT--HE'S NOT--

14:03.150 --> 14:07.519
- HONEY, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.518
I'M SORRY. I BET THAT
WAS REALLY AWFUL FOR YOU.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.609
- YEAH, I'M SURE IT WAS
REALLY AWFUL FOR ME, BUT I'M--

14:14.920 --> 14:17.707
LOOK. ALL THAT STUFF
IS IN THE PAST.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.026
AND LET'S JUST
LEAVE IT THERE.

14:19.130 --> 14:21.712
LET'S JUST MOVE FORWARD
WITH OUR FUTURE.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.685
I'VE NEVER
BEEN HAPPIER, EVER.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.234
- [sighs]

14:25.340 --> 14:27.922
- YOU'RE THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

14:28.030 --> 14:30.134
I LOVE YOU.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.585
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
- WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.107
- YEAH, IT REMINDS ME
OF THAT SONG COURT AND SPARK.

14:39.220 --> 14:40.972
- COURT AND SPARK?
- YEAH.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.071
- UM, NO, WHO'S THAT BY?

14:43.190 --> 14:46.284
- THAT'S BY JONI MITCHELL.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.799
- OH, YOU KNOW,
I REALLY ONLY KNOW

14:47.920 --> 14:49.251
THAT ONE SONG
THAT I PLAYED YOU.

14:49.370 --> 14:50.701
IT WAS FROM A MOVIE.
- OH.

14:50.820 --> 14:53.288
- MY MOM DIGS IT, SO--

14:53.400 --> 14:54.879
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE THIS, LIKE,

14:54.990 --> 14:56.810
BIG JONI MITCHELL SUPER FAN.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.717
- I'M--YEAH, I GUESS SO.
- THAT'S KINDA COOL.

14:59.820 --> 15:00.991
HOW ABOUT I COME BY
YOUR ROOM LATER?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.783
YOU CAN, LIKE, PLAY ME
MORE OF HER STUFF.

15:02.900 --> 15:06.484
- COOL, YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YA.

15:10.180 --> 15:11.932
- HOW YOU COMING, VICTOR?

15:12.040 --> 15:13.382
- GOOD.

15:13.490 --> 15:16.835
I THINK I GOT THIS THING
CLEANED PRETTY GOOD.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.941
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT THING IS?

15:19.050 --> 15:20.915
THAT'S A WATER PUMP.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.180
- WHAT DOES IT DO?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.801
- WELL, IT'S THE HEART
OF THE ENGINE,

15:23.920 --> 15:24.909
THAT'S WHAT IT DOES.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.089
I MEAN, IT COOLS EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW?

15:26.200 --> 15:28.532
YOU WAN NA SCRUB THAT
REALLY GOOD.

15:28.650 --> 15:30.163
YOU KNOW, THAT'S CALLED
THE IMPELLER THERE.

15:30.270 --> 15:33.330
GET THOSE BOLTS,
'CAUSE THOSE ARE TRICKY.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.135
- I THINK I COULD
CLEAN IT EVEN BETTER.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.447
- YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

15:37.550 --> 15:37.993
- I'M DONE.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.729
- LET ME SEE.

15:41.830 --> 15:43.798
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.140
YOU GRAB THAT BABY
AND START ON THAT.

15:45.250 --> 15:48.003
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE
SOME MORE ELBOW GREASE NOW.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.213
- WHAT IS THAT?

15:49.320 --> 15:51.424
- WHAT'S WHAT?
- THE ELBOW GREASE.

15:51.530 --> 15:53.566
- THAT'S JUST WHEN
YOU SCRUB HARD.

15:53.670 --> 15:54.841
- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,

15:54.950 --> 15:57.225
IT IS MY WIFE'S
COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION

15:57.330 --> 15:59.184
THAT TRULY MAKES HER
THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR,

15:59.300 --> 16:01.916
AND WHY YOU SHOULD
FEEL CONFIDENT

16:02.030 --> 16:05.124
DONATING MONEY
TO HER CAMPAIGN.

16:05.240 --> 16:08.403
- I AM URGING YOU,
AS YOUR FRIEND AND YOUR BROTHER,

16:08.510 --> 16:10.091
NOT TO MAKE THAT SPEECH
TO MISTAH R.A.Y.

16:10.210 --> 16:12.474
- CROSBY, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS, OKAY?

16:12.590 --> 16:13.614
I PROMISED KRISTINA,

16:13.730 --> 16:14.799
AND NOW I JUST WANT
TO GET IT OVER WITH.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.969
- WELL, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.890
I'M SURE SHE'LL APPRECIATE
THE ENTHUSIASM.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.079
OH, HEY.
- HEY.

16:19.180 --> 16:21.239
- YOU GUYS READY?
- UH, ACTUALLY, NO.

16:21.350 --> 16:23.489
I JUST CAME UP HERE TO SAY
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GREAT,

16:23.600 --> 16:25.591
BETTER THAN
ASHES OF ROME DESERVES.

16:25.700 --> 16:29.420
BUT TODAY IS THE BAND'S
LAST DAY AT THE STUDIO.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.325
- HOLD ON A SECOND.
AFTER PUTTING UP

16:30.430 --> 16:32.250
WITH ALL THAT,
YOU'RE FIRING US?

16:32.370 --> 16:35.533
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONES
GETTING FIRED.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.743
both: MM.

16:36.850 --> 16:38.158
- I'VE GOT TO TELL THE BAND
THAT I'M DROPPING 'EM.

16:38.270 --> 16:39.544
SORRY FOR MAKING YOUR LIFE
SO MISERABLE

16:39.650 --> 16:41.026
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.267
HOPEFULLY, WE CAN SEND
SOME BETTER BUSINESS

16:42.380 --> 16:44.063
YOUR WAY IN THE FUTURE.
- OH, I WOULD LOVE THAT.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.376
THANK YOU.
- SOON.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.299
both: ALL RIGHT.

16:46.410 --> 16:47.684
- THANKS FOR HELPING ME
THROUGH THAT.

16:47.790 --> 16:49.132
[whis
per
YES! 5]

16:49.240 --> 16:50.650
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.000
WE JUST LOST BUSINESS.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.338
- THAT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE
OF MY LIFE.

16:53.460 --> 16:54.722
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF
FINANCIAL PRESSURE

16:54.840 --> 16:56.592
I'M UNDER RIGHT NOW
WITH THIS CAMPAIGN GOING ON?

16:56.700 --> 16:58.144
- LISTEN TO ME.
AS THE FATHER OF A NEWBORN,

16:58.250 --> 16:59.660
LIFE IS TOO SHORT FOR THAT.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.385
- WELL, AS THE FATHER
OF THREE CHILDREN,

17:01.500 --> 17:02.285
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT LIFE
IS EXPENSIVE.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.288
SO WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TO FIGURE OUT

17:04.400 --> 17:05.606
HOW WE'RE GONNA
FILL OUR SCHEDULE

17:05.710 --> 17:07.189
WHILE I GO OVER
TO MISTAH R.A.Y.'S HOUSE

17:07.300 --> 17:10.019
AND BEG HIM
FOR SOME CAMPAIGN MONEY?

17:10.130 --> 17:11.745
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HEY, HEY.
- WHAT?

17:11.850 --> 17:14.501
- DON'T FORGET THESE.
- WOULD YOU GIVE ME THE--

17:14.610 --> 17:16.123
- LISTEN TO ME.
- DON'T DO THAT.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.195
- LISTEN, THESE
ARE VERY VALUABLE.

17:17.310 --> 17:19.710
- CROSBY, KNOCK IT OFF.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.298
- OKAY.
[chuckles]

17:22.420 --> 17:24.581
[buzz]

17:24.690 --> 17:25.372
- HEY, YO.
WHO THIS?

17:25.490 --> 17:27.958
- UH, HEY,
IT'S ADAM BRAVERMAN.

17:28.080 --> 17:31.106
I'M HERE TO SEE MISTAH R.A.Y.

17:31.220 --> 17:34.257
UH, OKAY,
I'LL JUST COME ON IN.

17:42.230 --> 17:45.336
- THANK YOU.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.052
- [chuckles]
ADAM BRAVERMAN.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.023
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, MY NINJA?

17:50.130 --> 17:51.950
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW YOU DOIN'?

17:52.070 --> 17:53.332
- I'M GOOD.

17:53.450 --> 17:54.997
- YO, SO HOW'S
THE LITTLE BABY DOIN'?

17:55.100 --> 17:56.067
- UH, GOOD.
- HEY, YO.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.444
SO THE FIRST TIME
I MET THIS FOOL,

17:57.550 --> 17:59.199
WE WAS SITTIN' ON MY COUCH
TALKIN' BUSINESS,

17:59.310 --> 18:01.312
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HIS WIFE WAS IN LABOR.

18:01.420 --> 18:04.071
- JUST HAVIN' A BABY,
FUNNY STORY.

18:04.180 --> 18:05.454
UH, SHE'S GOOD.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.141
THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOOD--
NORA.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.148
AND MY WIFE IS GOOD TOO,
WHICH IS A PERFECT SEGUE

18:08.250 --> 18:10.218
TO WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO ABOUT.

18:10.330 --> 18:11.729
- YO, YO, YO, YO, YO.
SLOW DOWN, WHITE BOY.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.252
- OKAY.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.497
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA ASK
MISTAH R.A.Y. HOW HE DOIN?

18:15.610 --> 18:18.636
- OF--OF COURSE, I JUST--
I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY MAN,

18:18.750 --> 18:20.194
DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE UP
A LOT OF YOUR TIME.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.028
BUT OF COURSE I WANT TO KNOW
HOW MISTAH R.A.Y.'S DOIN'.

18:21.130 --> 18:25.373
I--HOW HE DOIN'?

18:25.480 --> 18:27.448
- MISTAH R.A.Y.
IS DAMN FINE!

18:27.550 --> 18:28.926
[laughter]

18:29.030 --> 18:30.133
MISTAH R.A.Y.
IS LIVIN' THE DREAM!

18:30.240 --> 18:32.800
- YEAH, RIGHT ON!
OKAY.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.721
WELL, I'M JUST HAPPY THAT
THAT ALBUM YOU RECORDED

18:35.830 --> 18:37.582
AT THE LUNCHEONETTE
WAS SUCH A BIG SUCCESS.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.554
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.
YO, LOOK AROUND.

18:39.670 --> 18:43.288
YO, THIS IS WHAT HARD WORK
AND TALENT GETS YOU.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.869
THANK YOU, JESUS CHRIST.

18:44.980 --> 18:46.140
HALLELUJAH.
both: AMEN.

18:46.260 --> 18:49.047
- AMEN TO THAT.
AND I JUST AM REAL HAPPY

18:49.160 --> 18:50.366
THAT THE LUNCHEONETTE COULD
PLAY A SMALL PART

18:50.470 --> 18:52.290
IN THE SUCCESS OF THAT ALBUM.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.537
I MEAN, A VERY SMALL PART,
NOT OBVIOUSLY

18:53.640 --> 18:56.052
AS LARGE A PART AS YOUR TALENT,
YOUR HARD WORK,

18:56.160 --> 18:58.720
AND, UH--AND JESUS.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.094
- I'M GETTIN', LIKE--
LIKE, A LITTLE VIBE

19:00.200 --> 19:03.067
FROM YOU RIGHT NOW.

19:03.170 --> 19:04.967
I SENSE YOU'RE TROUBLED, ADAM.

19:05.070 --> 19:07.447
- OH, WELL, I MEAN, WE'VE HAD
SOME TROUBLES AT WORK.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.993
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH TIME.
- WELL, YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

19:09.110 --> 19:10.134
- WHATEVER YOU NEED,
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.070
- AH, IT'S--YOU KNOW,
JUST, WE LOST A CLIENT.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.249
AND, UH--
- OH, DAMN.

19:13.350 --> 19:14.556
I'M SORRY, MAN.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.171
I KNOW HOW IT IS.
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

19:16.290 --> 19:17.211
WE LOST A CLIENT, LIKE,
WE LOST THEIR BUSINESS.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.288
THEY WERE DROPPED
BY THEIR LABEL.

19:19.390 --> 19:20.322
WE JUST LOST THEIR BUSINESS.

19:20.430 --> 19:21.874
- AH, THAT LABEL BULL, MAN.

19:21.980 --> 19:23.049
- YEAH, THEY'RE STILL ALIVE.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.151
- LABEL CRAP, MAN...
THEY'RE GOOD AT

19:25.260 --> 19:27.057
RUINING GOOD MUSIC.
- YEAH.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.264
- SEE, THAT'S WHY
I PUT A STUDIO IN HERE,

19:29.370 --> 19:31.509
'CAUSE MISTAH R.A.Y.
ANSWERS TO NOBODY.

19:31.610 --> 19:32.406
- SO YOU'RE NOT
WITH A LABEL,

19:32.510 --> 19:34.091
OR YOU'RE WITH
YOUR OWN LABEL?

19:34.200 --> 19:35.474
- YEAH, I DO
MY OWN THING, MAN.

19:35.580 --> 19:36.444
WE'RE TAKIN' OUR MUSIC
STRAIGHT TO THE STREETS.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.235
THAT'S THE FUTURE
RIGHT THERE, BITCH.

19:39.350 --> 19:42.171
- YOU THINK?
- HELL, YEAH.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.133
YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK
FOR THE MAN.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.310
YOU WANT TO BE THE MAN.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.411
YO, THAT CHANGED MY LIFE,
ADAM BRAVERMAN.

19:48.530 --> 19:50.760
IT CHANGED MY LIFE.

19:50.870 --> 19:53.873
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?
- I THINK I DO.

19:57.950 --> 20:00.293
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.367
WE JUST GOT TO TALKING
ABOUT BUSINESS,

20:01.470 --> 20:02.949
AND THEN IT WAS OVER.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.573
AND I WAS PREPARED.
I HAD NOTE CARDS AND EVERYTHING.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.886
I JUST--I FEEL LIKE
I LET YOU DOWN.

20:05.990 --> 20:07.366
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DIDN'T LET ME DOWN, HONEY.

20:07.480 --> 20:10.335
IT'S SO AWKWARD ASKING PEOPLE
FOR MONEY, IT'S FINE.

20:10.450 --> 20:11.826
- I CHASED AFTER HIM,
AND THEY JUST TOOK OFF.

20:11.930 --> 20:12.919
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU TRIED.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS,

20:13.030 --> 20:14.588
IS YOU TRIED,
AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

20:14.690 --> 20:17.136
- HOW'D YOU DO?

20:17.250 --> 20:18.933
- UGH, NOT SO HOT.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.348
I MEAN, I DID OKAY I GUESS.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.655
I TALKED TO THIS REALLY GREAT
RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHER.

20:22.770 --> 20:25.216
SHE STARTED TEACHING
AT BERKELEY UNIFIED IN 1948.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.560
SHE WAS THE KINDEST WOMAN
IN THE WORLD.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.831
SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME
ALL OF HER EXTRA MONEY

20:28.950 --> 20:31.225
FOR THIS CAMPAIGN,
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED IN ME.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.422
- THAT'S GREAT.
- 25 BUCKS.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.633
- [chuckles]
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.365
SHE WAS SO SWEET
ON THE PHONE.

20:36.470 --> 20:38.153
IT WAS JUST HEARTBREAKING.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.601
IT'S LIKE THE PEOPLE
THAT DON'T HAVE MONEY

20:39.720 --> 20:41.119
ARE THE ONES THAT
WANT ME TO BE MAYOR.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.548
- I REALLY--I FEEL LIKE
I LET YOU DOWN.

20:42.650 --> 20:43.958
- YOU DIDN'T LET ME DOWN.
- OH, TELL ME YOU GOT GOOD NEWS

20:44.070 --> 20:45.094
FOR ME--PLEASE, PEOPLE.
CHECK?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.474
SIGNED PHOTO OF MISTAH R.A.Y.,
ANYTHING?

20:46.590 --> 20:47.921
- I FORGOT THE PHOTO,
AND IT JUST--

20:48.030 --> 20:49.349
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

20:49.450 --> 20:50.417
- WHAT?
AH, DAMN IT.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.999
- HE TRIED SO HARD.
HE DID HIS THING.

20:52.110 --> 20:53.099
- GUYS, WHAT HAPPENED?

20:53.210 --> 20:54.654
- IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK.
I'M SORRY.

20:54.770 --> 20:56.271
- THAT'S ALL?
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK?

20:56.390 --> 20:59.359
OKAY. WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY
I COME BEARING GOOD NEWS.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.688
- REALLY?
WHAT IS IT?

21:00.810 --> 21:04.109
- I GOT YOU A MEETING
WITH HARRY LERNER.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.801
- THE DEVELOPER?

21:05.910 --> 21:07.252
- DON'T SAY IT LIKE
IT'S A DIRTY WORD, KRISTINA.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.224
HE'S A MILLIONAIRE,
THAT MEANS CHECKS...

21:08.330 --> 21:08.989
- GOOD THING. OKAY, GOOD.
GOOD, GOOD.

21:09.090 --> 21:09.567
- DONATIONS.
- A LOT OF MONEY.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.705
HOW DID YOU SCORE THAT GUY?

21:11.820 --> 21:13.401
- BECAUSE I'M RELENTLESS,
AND I'M ANNOYING,

21:13.510 --> 21:15.546
AND I DON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.810
- DOES HE KNOW WHERE WE STAND

21:16.930 --> 21:17.783
ON THE DOWNTOWN LOFT PROJECT,
THOUGH?

21:17.890 --> 21:19.619
- WE CAN BE VAGUE.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY

21:19.720 --> 21:21.278
OF A PERSON-TO-PERSON MEETING.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.540
- I JUST--
- FACE TO FACE,

21:22.660 --> 21:23.854
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET
INTO SPECIFICS, KRISTINA.

21:23.970 --> 21:25.278
WE GUIDE THE CONVERSATION.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.483
WE AVOID WHAT WE
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

21:26.590 --> 21:28.558
- AS LONG AS WE'RE CLEAR THAT
IF I GET ELECTED,

21:28.660 --> 21:30.343
I'M NOT GONNA SUPPORT
HIS ENDEAVORS.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.597
- ALL RIGHT.
IF IT COMES UP,

21:31.700 --> 21:33.486
WE'LL BE VERY CLEAR THAT
YOU WON'T SUPPORT IT.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.760
BUT WE DON'T NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

21:34.870 --> 21:37.566
GO UPSTAIRS AND GET DRESSED.
- I'M DRESSED.

21:37.670 --> 21:41.663
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
UPSTAIRS, COME ON.

21:41.780 --> 21:42.986
- I REALLY DON'T LIKE
THAT TONE.

21:43.090 --> 21:45.706
- I LIKE HER.
- MM.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.880
- I--YOU KNOW,
I SAT DOWN WITH BOB LITTLE

21:48.990 --> 21:51.299
THE OTHER DAY,
AND HE'S A SMART KID.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.616
AND HE GETS IT.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.199
BUT I WANT TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

21:54.310 --> 21:55.334
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

21:55.450 --> 21:56.519
AND TO BE HONEST,
THIS ONE DIDN'T GIVE ME

21:56.620 --> 21:58.201
MUCH OF A CHOICE.
- YEAH.

21:58.310 --> 22:00.449
- SHE'S VERY PERSISTENT.
I RESPECT THAT.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.629
- WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SITTING DOWN WITH US

22:01.730 --> 22:04.244
AND TAKING THE TIME.
I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE.

22:04.350 --> 22:05.521
DO YOU LIVORN BERKELEY?

22:05.630 --> 22:07.518
- NO, I'M--UH, MILL VALLEY.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.905
- OH, MILL VALLEY.
WOW.

22:10.010 --> 22:11.181
IT'S PRETTY NICE UP THERE.
IT'S GORGEOUS.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.734
- YEAH, BUT I WENT TO CAL.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.467
SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
A DREAM OF MINE

22:14.570 --> 22:15.559
TO SEE DOWNTOWN BERKELEY
GET REVITALIZED

22:15.670 --> 22:18.059
'CAUSE IT'S, YOU KNOW--
- WOW, GREAT.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.889
AND KRISTINA WENT TO CAL TOO.
- I WENT TO CAL.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.153
- YEAH, THAT'S WHERE HER PASSION
FOR EDUCATION BEGAN.

22:23.270 --> 22:24.919
- MM-HMM. I SAW A SYSTEM
THAT WAS BROKEN,

22:25.030 --> 22:26.167
AND THAT'S WHY I'M PUTTING
MY HAT IN THE RING FOR MAYOR.

22:26.270 --> 22:27.680
- OKAY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY LOFT PROJECT.

22:27.790 --> 22:31.135
I'M CREATING A MULTI-USE
APARTMENT COMPLEX DOWNTOWN.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.309
- THE TEN-STORY ONE?

22:32.420 --> 22:34.229
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S EIGHT OR, YOU KNOW,

22:34.350 --> 22:35.510
MIGHT ONLY BE ABLE
TO GET TO DO SIX BECAUSE,

22:35.630 --> 22:36.619
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW HIGH WE'RE GONNA

22:36.730 --> 22:39.107
BE ABLE TO GO,
BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO

22:39.210 --> 22:40.177
HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH
A LOT OF HOOPS

22:40.280 --> 22:42.760
TO GET ANYTHING APPROVED
HERE IN BERKELEY.

22:42.870 --> 22:44.622
- BERKELEY CITIZENS
ARE PRETTY INVOLVED, YOU KNOW.

22:44.740 --> 22:45.729
WITH THAT PROJECT
COMES A LOT OF, LIKE,

22:45.840 --> 22:47.637
CONSTRUCTION AND TRAFFIC
AND CONGESTION--

22:47.740 --> 22:49.879
- AND WHAT THEY NEED
IS A LEADER WHO CAN

22:49.980 --> 22:51.948
REALLY EXPLAIN TO THEM

22:52.060 --> 22:53.948
THE PROS AND CONS
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

22:54.060 --> 22:55.778
YOU KNOW, IT COULD ADD JOBS,
IT COULD BOOST THE ECONOMY.

22:55.890 --> 22:57.369
- EXACTLY.
'CAUSE, FRANKLY, LOOK.

22:57.470 --> 22:59.574
THE PROJECTIONS ARE SAYING
THAT THE LERNER GROUP

22:59.680 --> 23:01.568
IS GOING TO CREATE
OVER 100 NEW CONSTRUCTION JOBS.

23:01.690 --> 23:04.204
- OH, THAT'S GREAT,
CONSTRUCTION.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.198
KRISTINA'S BROTHER-IN-LAW
IS A CONTRACTOR.

23:06.310 --> 23:07.720
SO HE'S GONNA LOVE THAT.

23:07.830 --> 23:09.411
- YEAH, AND 60% OF THOSE JOBS
ARE GONNA BE UNION.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.203
BUT WHAT I NEED IS,

23:11.320 --> 23:12.582
I NEED TO GET BY
THE ZONING REVIEW BOARD.

23:12.700 --> 23:14.656
AND THE FIRST TIME,
IT PASSED EIGHT TO ZERO.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.169
BUT THEN IT GOT KICKED BACK UP
TO THE CITY COUNCIL

23:16.290 --> 23:17.484
FOR FURTHER REVIEW.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.044
- I THINK THE PROCESS
TAKES A WHILE.

23:19.150 --> 23:20.765
- YEAH, THERE'S SO MUCH PORK
AND FAT IN THE GOVERNMENT,

23:20.880 --> 23:23.348
AND THAT'S WHAT KRISTINA
WANTS TO CUT OUT.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.539
- THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW,

23:24.640 --> 23:25.709
I FEEL VERY STRONGLY
ABOUT THIS PROJECT,

23:25.810 --> 23:27.493
AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT
I'M GONNA GIVE IT UP.

23:27.610 --> 23:28.747
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- I LIKE THAT.

23:28.850 --> 23:29.635
I ADMIRE YOUR TENACITY,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY

23:29.750 --> 23:31.809
WHY I'M RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.672
YOU KNOW, MY MAIN FOCUS
IS EDUCATION,

23:33.790 --> 23:37.851
AND I'M SO PASSIONATE
ABOUT THAT, SO--

23:37.960 --> 23:39.848
- AND WE DEFINITELY--
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU.

23:39.970 --> 23:42.302
WE REALLY WANT TO SEE
YOUR PROJECT GO THROUGH,

23:42.420 --> 23:44.308
RIGHT, KRISTINA?
- YEAH.

23:44.420 --> 23:47.765
BUT, YOU KNOW, MY MAIN FOCUS
IS EDUCATION.

23:47.870 --> 23:50.862
- YEAH.

23:50.980 --> 23:54.450
[cranking]

23:54.570 --> 23:58.085
- [grunts]

23:58.190 --> 23:59.259
[car door shuts]

23:59.360 --> 24:00.258
- MOM'S HERE.
WE'RE SAVED.

24:00.360 --> 24:03.739
- HI, SWEETHEART.
- HI, HOW'D IT GO?

24:03.850 --> 24:05.533
- PLEASE TAKE ME HOME NOW.

24:05.650 --> 24:07.538
- MM-MM. NO.
WELL, OFFICIALLY,

24:07.650 --> 24:09.789
THEY STILL HAVE TEN MORE MINUTES
ON THE CLOCK.

24:09.890 --> 24:12.131
- YOU HEARD YOUR GRANDPA.
TEN MORE MINUTES, SYD.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.026
- AWESOME. GRANDPA,
I THINK IF WE HURRY UP,

24:14.140 --> 24:16.131
WE CAN STILL FINISH
DISASSEMBLING THIS WATER PUMP.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.480
- YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.273
THIS ONE SEEMS A LITTLE TIGHT
THOUGH, DOESN'T IT?

24:19.380 --> 24:19.892
- YEAH.

24:20.010 --> 24:23.389
- OKAY.

24:23.490 --> 24:24.934
I DON'T HAVE MY GLASSES HERE.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.803
WE'RE ON STEP FOUR.

24:26.910 --> 24:28.764
WHY DON'T YOU
READ IT OUT THERE.

24:33.540 --> 24:40.878
- "IT IS P-POSSIBLE

24:40.990 --> 24:47.543
"THAT SOM E--SOM E--

24:47.650 --> 24:49.333
THAT SOME BOLTS--"

24:49.450 --> 24:50.439
- COME ON,
JUST LET ME DO IT.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.962
WE'LL BE HERE ALL DAY.

24:53.070 --> 24:54.799
"IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT SOME BOLTS

24:54.900 --> 24:55.798
"TAKE MORE EFFORT TO REMOVE
THAN OTHERS.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.869
THIS POSSIBLY INDICATES
IMPROPER TORQUE."

25:04.290 --> 25:05.905
- HEY.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.437
- COME ON,
GIVE DADDY A SMILE.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.744
- SMILE FOR DADDY.
LOOK AT DADDY.

25:18.860 --> 25:20.020
- HEY, CROS.
- GIVE ME A LITTLE SMILE.

25:20.130 --> 25:21.449
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

25:21.550 --> 25:22.824
- UH-OH, UNCLE BOSS IS HERE.
- HEY, JASMINE.

25:22.930 --> 25:24.852
- MY MOM WAS HERE ALL MORNING,
SO SHE'S A LITTLE TIRED.

25:24.970 --> 25:26.164
- HONEY, TICKLE HER
OR SOMETHING.

25:26.280 --> 25:26.826
I WANT TO SEE A LITTLE SMILE
BEFORE I HANG UP.

25:26.930 --> 25:28.864
- JASMINE, HOW YOU DOIN'?

25:28.970 --> 25:29.937
WE JUST GOT A LITTLE BUSINESS
CONVERSATION HERE--

25:30.040 --> 25:31.200
OH, LOOK AT THAT SMILE!
THAT'S GREAT.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.594
YOU GOT YOUR SMILE.
- THAT'S NOT A SMILE.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.315
- OKAY, BYE JASMINE.
- NO, NO, NO, DON'T TURN IT.

25:34.420 --> 25:35.978
- FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME,
YOU CAN CALL 'EM BACK IN FIVE

25:36.080 --> 25:37.047
MINUTES--IMPORTANT BUSINESS.
- WHEN I TOOK MY JOB HERE,

25:37.150 --> 25:39.766
I WAS PROMISED A FAMILY-FRIENDLY
ENVIRONMENT.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.461
- THIS IS SO FAMILY-FRIENDLY,
IT'S GONNA GET EVEN BETTER.

25:41.570 --> 25:43.049
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.297
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

25:44.400 --> 25:45.981
- NO, WHAT IS IT?

25:46.090 --> 25:49.218
- THAT'S OUR FUTURE.
- IT'S A BUNCH OF NUMBERS.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.717
OUR FUTURE IS A BUNCH OF MATH
AND NUMBERS?

25:51.820 --> 25:53.264
- JUST FORGET ABOUT THE NUMBERS
FOR RIGHT NOW,

25:53.370 --> 25:54.507
OKAY?
- OKAY.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.303
- ALL THAT IS TO SAY,
IT'S TIME FOR US

25:56.410 --> 25:59.038
TO START OUR OWN LABEL.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.721
- [laughs]

26:00.830 --> 26:03.822
YOU WANT TO START OUR OWN LABEL?
- YEAH.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.692
- YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
LEFT IN AMERICA THAT

26:05.800 --> 26:07.210
DOESN'T KNOW THAT THE MUSIC
INDUSTRY IS DYING?

26:07.320 --> 26:07.934
- OH, IT'S NOT DYING.
- YOU'RE THE LAST ONE?

26:08.040 --> 26:09.837
- ALL RIGHT.
IT'S D.I.Y.

26:09.940 --> 26:10.861
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
DO IT YOURSELF.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.380
SO FORGET ABOUT
THE OLD BUSINESS MODEL,

26:13.500 --> 26:14.569
OKAY?
- UH-HUH.

26:14.670 --> 26:15.978
- WE ARE GONNA BE
A ONE-STOP SHOP.

26:16.090 --> 26:18.729
THE BANDS THAT WE SIGN
ARE GONNA BE RECORDED BY US,

26:18.850 --> 26:21.227
PRODUCED BY US,
AND THEIR MUSIC

26:21.330 --> 26:23.298
IS GONNA BE DISTRIBUTED BY US.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.709
- MM. AND THEN WHO PAYS US?

26:25.820 --> 26:28.027
- WELL, THAT'S ALL
IN THE NUMBERS HERE,

26:28.130 --> 26:29.438
AND I CAN EXPLAIN IT
IN DETAIL IF YOU WANT.

26:29.550 --> 26:30.403
- I DON'T NEED
THIS EXPLAINED TO ME.

26:30.510 --> 26:32.205
I NEED TO KNOW
WHO'S GONNA PAY US.

26:32.310 --> 26:34.130
- ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS THAT REAL PROFITABILITY

26:34.240 --> 26:35.650
IS A REAL POSSIBILITY.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.581
IT IS TIME FOR YOU AND I
TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL

26:38.700 --> 26:41.521
AND TRULY START
WORKING FOR OURSELVES.

26:41.630 --> 26:42.767
- WE ALREADY WORK
FOR OURSELVES.

26:42.870 --> 26:44.599
- NO, NO, WE DON'T.
- YEAH, WE ALREADY--

26:44.700 --> 26:45.553
- NO, WE DON'T.
WE'RE STILL BEHOLDEN

26:45.670 --> 26:47.661
TO THE LABELS
AND THE PRODUCERS.

26:47.770 --> 26:48.839
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO WORK FOR THE MAN,

26:48.950 --> 26:50.770
YOU GOT TO BE THE MAN.

26:50.880 --> 26:53.531
- WOW, THAT IS INSPIRATIONAL.
- LISTEN TO ME--

26:53.640 --> 26:54.777
- HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET
THIS AMAZING TALENT?

26:54.880 --> 26:58.259
'CAUSE NO BAND WORTH ITS SALT
IS GONNA SIGN

26:58.370 --> 26:59.917
WITH AN UNPROVEN LABEL--
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

27:00.030 --> 27:02.260
- WELL, THEY WOULD IF THEY JUST
GOT DROPPED BY THEIR LABEL.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.094
- YOU WANT ASHES OF ROME
TO COME BACK HERE.

27:07.210 --> 27:07.892
- BOOM, YOU GOT IT. EXACTLY.
- THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.059
YOU WANT TO SIGN
THOSE IDIOTS?

27:10.180 --> 27:11.659
- WE'RE GONNA
SIGN THOSE IDIOTS.

27:11.760 --> 27:12.749
- LET'S PUT ASIDE
FOR A SECOND THAT

27:12.870 --> 27:13.894
I THINK THE LEAD SINGER
IS REPUGNANT,

27:14.010 --> 27:16.478
AND FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT
THE ONLY GOOD THING

27:16.600 --> 27:17.760
ABOUT THAT BAND
IS THEIR SONGS,

27:17.870 --> 27:19.451
WHICH THEY
DON'T OWN ANYMORE.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.289
THEY'RE OWNED
BY THEIR EX-LABEL.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.904
OH, YOU HAVE A LOOK OF CONFUSION
ON YOUR FACE.

27:24.020 --> 27:25.806
THIS BUSINESS, WHICH YOU CLAIM
TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT,

27:25.920 --> 27:27.535
WORKS THAT WAY.
- WELL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.050
- IT'S NOT RIGHT, BUT THAT'S
THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.673
- THAT IS REALLY
NOT RIGHT, CROS.

27:30.780 --> 27:31.986
- YEAH, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:32.090 --> 27:32.533
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER REASON
WHY WE HAVE TO DO THIS:

27:32.650 --> 27:33.844
TO RIGHT THAT WRONG.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.439
WE'RE GONNA
GET THOSE SONGS BACK.

27:35.550 --> 27:36.778
LET'S DO IT.
- [laughs]

27:36.890 --> 27:39.267
- HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET THE SONGS BACK?

27:39.380 --> 27:40.199
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.789
- I TELL YOU WHAT.
I WILL GET BACK

27:41.900 --> 27:43.128
IN THE CONTROL ROOM
WITH OLIVER ROME

27:43.240 --> 27:44.377
IF YOU CAN
GET THOSE SONGS BACK.

27:44.490 --> 27:45.206
- I'M ON IT.
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

27:45.310 --> 27:47.756
- YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST ME.
- THIS IS--

27:47.870 --> 27:49.792
- ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.549
- [grunts]
- I'M NOT TOO NERVOUS

27:51.670 --> 27:54.559
ABOUT THIS HAPPENING,
AS YOU CAN SEE.

27:54.670 --> 27:58.117
- BUT NOW THEY ONLY
BLOCK THE SUN

27:58.220 --> 27:59.699
THE RAIN AND SNOW
ON EVERYONE

27:59.810 --> 28:00.913
- I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
MAYBE IT'S NOT AS GOOD

28:01.020 --> 28:01.918
AS I REMEMBER.
- NO, I LOVE IT.

28:02.020 --> 28:05.433
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

28:05.540 --> 28:08.668
PLAY ME SOMETHING ELSE.

28:08.790 --> 28:10.576
- OKAY, UM...

28:10.680 --> 28:12.124
I--I CAN'T.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.925
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO IT.
- WHY? WHY NOT?

28:15.030 --> 28:17.783
- JONI MITCHELL IS--
I DON'T KNOW.

28:17.900 --> 28:20.960
I KIND OF--
I PRETENDED TO LIKE HER

28:21.070 --> 28:25.484
JUST 'CAUSE I KNEW THAT
YOU LIKED HER.

28:25.600 --> 28:29.525
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

28:29.630 --> 28:33.908
- I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
I LIKE YOU.

28:34.020 --> 28:38.491
LIKE, MORE THAN
JUST FRIENDS.

28:38.610 --> 28:41.602
- OH.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.051
UM--

28:43.160 --> 28:45.469
- IT'S ALSO COOL IF YOU DON'T,
YOU KNOW, LIKE ME BACK.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.195
I'M NOT SAYING THAT--
I WON'T BE WEIRD OR ANYTHING.

28:47.310 --> 28:49.756
I JUST COULDN'T--
I COULDN'T KEEP

28:49.860 --> 28:52.681
PLAYING JONI MITCHELL
AND PRETENDING.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.926
I JUST COULDN'T DO IT.

28:54.040 --> 28:57.555
- IT'S FINE, REALLY.

28:57.660 --> 29:00.481
UM...

29:00.600 --> 29:02.807
WELL, NOW I KNOW.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.635
- HERE, I'LL PLAY BEACH HOUSE
OR SOMETHING.

29:09.740 --> 29:10.911
- GREAT.

29:11.020 --> 29:13.466
- WELL, NOW, DO YOU
HAVE ENOUGH FOOD THERE?

29:13.570 --> 29:16.459
- I--THIS IS FOR JOEL, SO
I DON'T HAVE TO COOK HIM DINNER.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.434
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING LEFT FOR ME.

29:18.540 --> 29:21.953
- COME ON.
GUYS, LET'S GO.

29:22.070 --> 29:22.889
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING
THIS, BY THE WAY, DAD.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.991
THIS IS--
- OH, COME ON. IT'S FUN.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.136
IT REALLY IS,
AND IT'S NICE TO BE NEEDED.

29:27.240 --> 29:31.131
- YOU ARE THAT.

29:31.250 --> 29:33.036
- UH, YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANT TO,

29:33.150 --> 29:36.790
YOU KNOW, PRY
OR STICK MY NOSE IN

29:36.910 --> 29:37.865
WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG,
SWEETHEART.

29:37.980 --> 29:38.969
- HIS READING'S REALLY BAD.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.662
- BOY. TSK.
- I KNOW.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.565
I'M WORKING WITH HIM
AT NIGHT, YOU KNOW,

29:42.670 --> 29:44.558
BUT THE BOOK REPORTS
ARE TORTURE.

29:44.670 --> 29:46.911
- MM-HMM.
- [sighs]

29:47.020 --> 29:48.533
- WELL, WHAT DO
THE TEACHERS SAY?

29:48.640 --> 29:51.507
- THEY SAY THAT IT'S BAD.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.054
ACTUALLY, THEY WANTED
TO HOLD HIM BACK A YEAR,

29:55.170 --> 29:57.547
MAKE HIM DO
FOURTH GRADE AGAIN.

29:57.650 --> 29:59.060
- THAT'S TOUGH.
- I KNOW.

29:59.170 --> 30:01.889
AND THEY SAID IT WAS OUR CHOICE,
SO WE SAID NO.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.275
BUT NOW, HE'S FALLING BEHIND
DAY BY DAY, I CAN SEE IT.

30:04.380 --> 30:07.315
JOEL SAYS I'M OVERREACTING,
BUT I CAN SEE IT, YOU KNOW.

30:07.420 --> 30:08.273
I DON'T MEAN TO DRAG YOU
INTO THIS.

30:08.390 --> 30:09.971
I JUST FEEL
KIND OF ALONE WITH IT.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.049
- WELL, HEY, LISTEN.

30:13.150 --> 30:15.323
I GOT YOUR BACK, OKAY.

30:15.430 --> 30:16.977
WHATEVER I CAN DO.

30:17.090 --> 30:18.182
- THANK YOU.
HERE, YOU CAN DO THAT.

30:18.290 --> 30:21.566
- THANK YOU.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.466
ARE YOU SURE YOU NEED
ALL OF THIS?

30:23.580 --> 30:24.467
- [scoffs]
- HONEY?

30:24.580 --> 30:24.955
- YEAH?

30:25.060 --> 30:27.676
- HEY.
- HI.

30:27.790 --> 30:29.951
- YOU WORKING AWAY?
- I AM.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.641
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

30:31.760 --> 30:34.888
HOW WAS WORK?
- GOOD. IT WAS GOOD.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.069
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

30:36.170 --> 30:39.037
$20,000, THE LERNER GROUP
CAME THROUGH.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.584
THAT'S GREAT, HUH?
- THEY SURE DID, RIGHT?

30:40.700 --> 30:41.962
- CONGRATULATIONS, RIGHT?

30:42.080 --> 30:44.002
- YEAH, SORT OF.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.839
I MEAN, IT TOOK HEATHER
LESS THAN SEVEN MINUTES

30:45.940 --> 30:47.384
TO SELL ME OUT IN THE MEETING.
- UH-OH.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.149
- I MEAN SHE WAS GREAT,
WONDERFUL.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.329
AND SHE MADE HIM FEEL HEARD

30:50.430 --> 30:51.977
WITHOUT MAKING
ANY OVERT PROMISES.

30:52.090 --> 30:53.398
SO THAT WAS
ALL WONDERFUL, BUT--

30:53.500 --> 30:56.082
- WELL, IT'S ALL GOOD THEN,
ISN'T IT?

30:56.190 --> 30:59.011
- I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST FEEL, LIKE, GROSS.

30:59.130 --> 31:02.361
EVERYONE'S GONNA KNOW THAT
ALL OF MY FUNDRAISING

31:02.480 --> 31:03.788
CAME FROM A DEVELOPER.

31:03.890 --> 31:05.198
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S LIKE--

31:05.310 --> 31:08.097
- LOOK, AS LONG AS YOU DO
THE RIGHT THING WITH THE MONEY,

31:08.210 --> 31:09.029
NOBODY'S GONNA CARE
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.994
- BUT I DO.
I CARE.

31:11.110 --> 31:12.441
I JUST WANT
TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT

31:12.560 --> 31:14.107
WHERE I'M GETTING THE MONEY
FOR MY CAMPAIGN.

31:14.210 --> 31:17.008
AND THIS CHECK, IT JUST DOESN'T
MAKE ME FEEL GOOD, YOU KNOW?

31:17.110 --> 31:19.351
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEN DON'T TAKE IT.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.837
- BUT IF I DON'T TAKE IT,
THEN THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER.

31:21.940 --> 31:22.838
- I KNOW,
IT'S A TOUGH CALL.

31:22.950 --> 31:26.738
- IT'S 20 GRAND.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

31:26.850 --> 31:28.909
NO, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
- DON'T PUT THIS ON ME KRISTINA.

31:29.020 --> 31:29.839
- I'M NOT PUTTING IN ON YOU.
I'M JUST ASKING YOU,

31:29.950 --> 31:31.360
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
- I THINK THAT,

31:31.470 --> 31:33.290
IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS,
THIS IS BUSINESS AS USUAL.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.537
- CASH THE CHECK?

31:34.650 --> 31:36.299
- [sighs]
IT'S A TOUGH CALL.

31:36.410 --> 31:38.366
- IT'S 6:00 PM.
DINNER SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.812
WHERE IS IT?
- I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY.

31:40.930 --> 31:42.306
YOU ARE CORRECT, SIR.

31:42.410 --> 31:44.651
- LET'S GO TO BURGER AND PIE.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.580
- IT'S ON TV THAT THEY BROUGHT
BACK THEIR TORPEDO BURGER.

31:46.690 --> 31:49.250
- YES, BURGER AND PIE.
I COULD USE A BREAK.

31:49.350 --> 31:51.147
OKAY. GO GRAB
MOM'S PURSE, BABE.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.036
I'M GONNA GET NORA, OKAY?

31:53.150 --> 31:55.118
HONEY, PLEASE GO
GET YOUR BAG.

31:55.220 --> 31:57.836
HERE, GIVE IT TO--

31:57.950 --> 31:59.110
OKAY. MAX?

31:59.220 --> 32:01.085
- OKAY.
- OH, BOY.

32:01.190 --> 32:03.533
- SEE IT LIKE YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.915
- IT'S INCREDIBLE, WOW.

32:06.020 --> 32:08.159
- FORGET THAT
YOU'VE BEEN HERE

32:08.270 --> 32:10.409
HAVING FOOD FIGHTS
WITH YOUR COUSINS.

32:10.510 --> 32:12.990
[both laugh]

32:13.100 --> 32:14.499
I MEAN, I'M JUST SAYING
THE PRICE IS RIGHT

32:14.620 --> 32:17.646
AND THE BATHROOMS WORK,
SO I DON'T KNOW.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.273
- NO, I MEAN IT'S GREAT,
IT IS.

32:19.380 --> 32:20.130
IT'S GREAT.
I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.174
OBVIOUSLY, I--
- REALLY?

32:22.280 --> 32:23.861
- OF COURSE.
I LOVE THE IDEA

32:23.970 --> 32:25.699
OF GETTING MARRIED HERE.

32:25.800 --> 32:26.721
I DON'T KNOW. JUST--

32:26.840 --> 32:29.217
ISN'T IT JUST GONNA BE
EXACTLY LIKE

32:29.320 --> 32:31.072
UNCLE CROSBY
AND JASMINE'S WEDDING?

32:31.190 --> 32:32.498
- NO, NO.
PICTURE YOUR WEDDING.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.147
WE--WE'LL MAKE IT DIFFERENT,
YOU KNOW?

32:34.260 --> 32:36.876
- YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.049
WHAT IF--
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.229
LOOK, IT'S UP TO YOU,
OKAY?

32:39.330 --> 32:41.218
I JUST--
I'M HERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

32:41.330 --> 32:43.605
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO CONSIDER IT.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.984
- UH-HUH. I ALMOST BELIEVED YOU
THAT TIME.

32:46.100 --> 32:47.670
I WAS VERY CLOSE.
- NO, REALLY, REALLY.

32:47.790 --> 32:50.099
- [laughs]

32:50.200 --> 32:51.269
I DON'T KNOW.

32:51.380 --> 32:56.135
OH, ALSO I--I TALKED TO RYAN
ABOUT HIS FAMILY.

32:56.250 --> 32:59.174
AND HE'S--THEY'RE DEFINITELY
NOT COMING, SO--

32:59.280 --> 33:01.976
- AWW.
- I DON'T KNOW.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.217
IT'S VERY STRESSFUL,
HIS PAST,

33:03.320 --> 33:05.800
AND HE JUST
KIND OF WANTS TO

33:05.910 --> 33:08.970
BUILD A NEW LIFE
WITH ME AND--

33:09.090 --> 33:10.284
- IF ONLY IT WERE THAT EASY.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.254
I MEAN, YOUR PAST IS WHAT
MAKES YOU WHO YOU ARE.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.703
IT'S WHAT YOU BRING
TO A MARRIAGE, YOU KNOW?

33:14.820 --> 33:18.847
IF ONLY WE COULD LEAVE THE PAST
BEHIND US, RIGHT?

33:18.960 --> 33:20.473
- YEAH.

33:20.580 --> 33:23.299
- [deep breath]

33:23.410 --> 33:24.570
- WHAT?
- I JUST DON'T--

33:24.690 --> 33:28.274
I JUST--LOOK, I'VE BEEN
WHERE YOU ARE IN TERMS

33:28.380 --> 33:30.928
OF BEING YOUNG
AND BEING HOPEFUL.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.348
- HERE WE GO,
HERE WE GO.

33:32.450 --> 33:34.270
THIS IS THE PART THAT
I KNEW I WAS GONNA COME.

33:34.390 --> 33:35.766
- THE PART WHERE I TELL YOU--
- YEAH.

33:35.870 --> 33:38.282
THAT YOU ACT ED LIKE MY MARRIAGE
IS THE SAME AS YOURS.

33:38.390 --> 33:40.802
- NO, NO, NO.
I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES

33:40.910 --> 33:42.764
THAT I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU--

33:42.880 --> 33:44.939
- BUT YOU ACT AS IF
YOU CAN EVEN

33:45.050 --> 33:46.392
POSSIBLY RELATE
TO MY SITUATION.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.421
- I CAN RELATE
TO YOUR SITUATION.

33:47.540 --> 33:48.939
- NO, YOU CAN'T!
- I CAN RELATE

33:49.060 --> 33:50.459
DIRECTLY TO YOUR SITUATION...
- YOU CAN'T.

33:50.580 --> 33:52.081
BECAUSE I MARRIED SOMEONE
WHEN THERE WERE

33:52.200 --> 33:53.781
LOTS OF WARNING SIGNS,
AND THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

33:53.890 --> 33:56.165
- ARE YOU SAYING THERE'S A LOT
OF WARNING SIGNS WITH RYAN?

33:56.270 --> 33:59.137
- YOUSAID THERE'S A LOT
OF WARNING SIGNS.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.923
- HE'S NOT LIKE DAD,
YOU KNOW.

34:01.030 --> 34:02.304
HE'S DIFFERENT,
AND HE'S VERY DEPENDABLE.

34:02.410 --> 34:04.207
AND HE'S SOLID.
AND HE WANTS THIS--

34:04.310 --> 34:05.891
- DEPENDABLE?
AMBER.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.560
I MEAN,
HE'S BEATEN PEOPLE UP.

34:08.660 --> 34:10.036
HE CRASHED YOUR CAR.

34:10.150 --> 34:11.765
YOU CAME TO ME LAST YEAR
WHEN YOU BROKE UP

34:11.870 --> 34:13.280
TO SAY THAT YOU--
YOU WERE AFRAID

34:13.390 --> 34:14.800
YOU'D BE HIS CARETAKER
THE REST OF--

34:14.910 --> 34:16.184
- THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
SAVING UP THIS WHOLE TIME,

34:16.290 --> 34:17.188
SO THAT THIS IS WHAT--
- I'M NOT SAVING IT UP!

34:17.290 --> 34:19.281
I'M JUST SAYING,
OPEN YOUR EYES

34:19.400 --> 34:20.321
AND BE CLEAR
ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

34:20.430 --> 34:23.058
I DON'T WANT YOU TO MAKE
THE MISTAKES I MADE.

34:23.160 --> 34:25.048
- YOU THINK THAT
MY SITUATION IS GONNA

34:25.160 --> 34:27.503
BE LIKE YOURS AND DAD'S,
AND IT'S JUST NOT AT ALL.

34:27.610 --> 34:28.645
[crying]
IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.786
AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME
THAT YOU THINK

34:30.890 --> 34:35.964
THAT IT WOULD EVER BE SIMILAR,
BECAUSE I'M NOT YOU.

34:36.070 --> 34:39.130
AND RYAN'S NOT DAD.

34:41.280 --> 34:45.341
I'M GONNA GO.
OKAY?

34:45.460 --> 34:47.246
I'M GONNA GET MARRIED
AT THE LAKE.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.737
I DECIDED ALREADY, OKAY?

34:49.840 --> 34:51.000
SO I HOPE THAT YOU COME.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.259
I HOPE THAT YOU LIKE IT.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.090
- MAN, YOU THE WORST
POOL PLAYER EVER.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.781
- MAN, WHATEVER.
WE'LL, PUT UP A "G" THEN.

35:07.890 --> 35:09.061
- I'LL PUT UP TWO Gs,
YOU AIN'T SAYIN' NOTHIN'.

35:09.170 --> 35:10.239
- WHITE BOY'S BACK.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.274
- YO, ADAM, WHAT UP, FOOL?
- HEY.

35:12.380 --> 35:13.233
- I SEE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT

35:13.350 --> 35:14.374
THE OTHER DAY, HUH?
- I DID.

35:14.490 --> 35:16.378
AND, UH, I FOUND IT
VERY INSPIRATIONAL,

35:16.490 --> 35:17.696
SO I SPOKE TO MY BROTHER
ABOUT IT.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.109
BUT THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE, UH--

35:20.220 --> 35:22.620
- NO PROBLEM,
HAVE A SEAT, MAN.

35:22.740 --> 35:25.254
- NO, I-I'D RATHER STAND.

35:25.360 --> 35:28.079
MY WIFE IS RUNNING
FOR MAYOR OF BERKELEY,

35:28.190 --> 35:29.350
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF HER.

35:29.470 --> 35:32.155
- SO YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
YOU WANT MY VOTE?

35:32.260 --> 35:33.636
SEE, I GOT THIS
LITTLE PRISON SITUATION

35:33.750 --> 35:35.809
THAT KIND OF MAKES ME,
UH, INELIGIBLE.

35:35.920 --> 35:39.924
- I SEE. WELL, MY WIFE
WOULD'VE LOVED YOUR VOTE.

35:40.030 --> 35:41.236
BUT WHAT SHE REALLY NEEDS
RIGHT NOW

35:41.340 --> 35:43.615
IS MONEY FOR HER CAMPAIGN.

35:43.720 --> 35:44.926
SEE, SHE'S RUNNING ON
AN EDUCATION PLATFORM.

35:45.030 --> 35:47.066
SHE REALLY WANTS
TO GET SCHOOLS

35:47.170 --> 35:48.558
HERE IN BERKELEY
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

35:48.660 --> 35:50.207
AND SHE'S GONNA DO IT,
IF SHE'S ELECTED.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.275
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S THE MOST TENACIOUS,

35:51.390 --> 35:52.960
SELFLESS PERSON
YOU'LL EVER MEET.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.149
AND HER PLATFORM
IS EDUCATION,

35:54.250 --> 35:55.456
SO SHE HAS A TOUGH TIME
RAISING MONEY.

35:55.560 --> 35:56.458
WE'VE GOT A LOT
OF SMALL DONATIONS,

35:56.560 --> 35:58.004
BUT WE NEED ONE BIG DONATION

35:58.120 --> 35:59.189
TO HELP US REALLY COMPETE
IN THIS RACE.

35:59.290 --> 35:59.972
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.664
- HOW MUCH YOU LOOKIN' FOR?

36:03.780 --> 36:07.398
- UH, $20,000.

36:13.790 --> 36:15.337
- YOU THINK SHE GOT
WHAT IT TAKES?

36:15.440 --> 36:19.160
- I DO. I KNOW SHE DOES.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.896
- WHAT YOU THINK?
- YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT I THINK.

36:22.000 --> 36:22.728
- MAN, IT'S FOR THE KIDS,
FOOL.

36:22.830 --> 36:25.936
IT'S ONLY 20 Gs.
WHAT YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

36:26.040 --> 36:28.270
HERE. HERE.

36:28.390 --> 36:29.869
- UH, HOLD ON A SECOND.

36:29.980 --> 36:33.256
MISTAH R.A.Y., I-I DON'T THINK
I CAN ACCEPT CASH.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.351
- LITTLE RAY!
- YEAH, DAD?

36:35.460 --> 36:37.257
- BRING DADDY HIS CHECKBOOK.
- OKAY, WHERE IS IT?

36:37.360 --> 36:38.429
- IT'S ON MY DESK.
- OKAY.

36:38.540 --> 36:39.768
- I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A SON.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.871
- [scoffs] YEAH,
THAT'S WHY I DO WHAT I DO.

36:41.990 --> 36:43.878
YEAH.
SAY HI TO MR. BRAVERMAN.

36:43.990 --> 36:45.082
- HELLO.
- HI.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.531
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

36:46.650 --> 36:49.335
- LOOK, THE SCHOOLS
IN THIS CITY ARE A JOKE.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.646
MAKE SURE SHE MAKES THEM BETTER,
ALL RIGHT?

36:50.760 --> 36:51.920
- SHE WILL. THAT'S WHAT
SHE'S GONNA DO.

36:52.030 --> 36:53.406
- OH, YEAH, AND TELL YOUR WIFE
THERE'S A SPEED BUMP

36:53.520 --> 36:54.714
AT THE END OF MY STREET.

36:54.830 --> 36:56.718
I DON'T LIKE IT.

36:56.830 --> 36:59.822
WHEN SHE GETS ELECTED,

36:59.940 --> 37:01.009
I WANT IT GONE.

37:01.110 --> 37:05.479
- OH, IT'S GONE.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.932
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.496
- HEY.
- HI.

37:13.610 --> 37:14.918
- HEY, BABE. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME SO EARLY?

37:15.020 --> 37:16.669
- ARE YOU FIXING THE CHAIR?

37:16.780 --> 37:18.122
- YEAH.
- YAY.

37:18.230 --> 37:19.333
- TRYING TO EARN MY KEEP
AROUND HERE.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.908
- FINALLY. HI.
- [laughs]

37:22.030 --> 37:25.989
YOUR MOM CALLED, LIKE,
TWO OR THREE TIMES.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.408
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?

37:27.520 --> 37:28.828
- SHE JUST LEFT A MESSAGE,
SAID TO CALL HER BACK.

37:28.930 --> 37:31.137
- [sighs]
SHE'S ANNOYING.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.559
- NO.
- MM-HMM.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.002
- SHE'S A MOM.
- SHE'S THE WORST.

37:34.110 --> 37:35.452
- [chuckles]

37:35.560 --> 37:37.937
- HMM. HEY, I GOT
SOME GOOD NEWS.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.029
- WHAT?

37:39.150 --> 37:41.527
- I HAVE DECIDED
THAT I WOULD

37:41.630 --> 37:44.281
OFFICIALLY LIKE TO MARRY YOU
AT THE LAKE.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.776
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

37:45.880 --> 37:46.904
- WOW.
- ARE YOU HAPPY?

37:47.020 --> 37:48.157
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

37:48.260 --> 37:50.637
- ARE YOU SURE?
- I'M POSITIVE.

37:50.750 --> 37:51.842
IT'S MAGICAL,
AND THERE'S...

37:51.950 --> 37:56.193
NOWHERE ELSE I'D RATHER
BECOME YOUR WIFE.

37:56.300 --> 37:57.619
- WHERE YOU--WHERE WE GOING?

37:57.720 --> 37:59.995
- TO SHOW MY APPRECIATION,
LIKE...

38:00.100 --> 38:01.579
- FINALLY.
- IN A SPECIAL WAY.

38:01.690 --> 38:02.964
[laughter]

38:10.800 --> 38:14.486
- I THOUGHT MY PUNISHMENT
WAS OVER.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.148
- WELL, JEEZ, I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED WORKING ON THE CAR.

38:18.190 --> 38:19.839
WELL, I DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

38:19.950 --> 38:23.841
I GOT--VICT OR,
I MEAN, HECK, YOU KNOW,

38:23.950 --> 38:25.429
I CAN'T DO THIS ON MY OWN,
YOU KNOW?

38:25.540 --> 38:26.984
- HOW COME SYDNEY DOESN'T
HAVE TO HELP?

38:27.090 --> 38:29.957
- WELL, YOU KNOW, SYDNEY,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

38:30.060 --> 38:33.405
IS PRETTY USELESS AROUND
ANYTHING MECHANICAL.

38:33.510 --> 38:35.262
- 'CAUSE SHE'S A GIRL?
- NO, NO, NO.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.540
NOT BECAUSE SHE'S A GIRL.

38:36.650 --> 38:39.414
YOUR AUNT SARAH
WAS AN ACE MECHANIC.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.863
I MEAN, YOUR SISTER--
I MEAN, SYDNEY--

38:41.970 --> 38:43.824
I MEAN, JIMINY CHRISTMAS,
YOU'VE SEEN HER WORK.

38:43.940 --> 38:44.861
- SHE WAS PRETTY BAD.

38:44.970 --> 38:45.937
I MEAN, MY PARTS WERE
WAY CLEANER THAN HERS.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.486
AND I FIGURED OUT HOW
TO PUT THE WATER PUMP

38:48.600 --> 38:50.807
BACK INSIDE THE CAR.

38:50.910 --> 38:52.138
- YEAH. SO I MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

38:52.260 --> 38:57.732
WILL YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

38:57.850 --> 39:01.434
- OKAY.
- GREAT.

39:02.300 --> 39:04.359
- OKAY.
- NOW, HERE'S THE DEAL.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.641
SEE, NOW IT'S GONNA
BE HARD WORK.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.399
I MEAN, WE'RE GONNA
GET STUCK SOMETIMES.

39:08.510 --> 39:10.853
WE WON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.781
AND, UH, WELL,
THAT MEANS WE'RE GONNA HAVE

39:13.900 --> 39:18.030
TO READ THE MANUAL
TO HELP US OUT.

39:21.390 --> 39:22.459
- I'M NOT GOOD AT READING.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.004
- WELL, HERE WE GO.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.259
SEE, MY EYES ARE OLD.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.669
AND, UH, THE PRINT
IS REALLY SMALL.

39:28.780 --> 39:30.350
I CAN'T DO THIS ON MY OWN.

39:30.470 --> 39:34.019
IT'S, UH--
IT'S UP TO YOU, KID.

39:34.130 --> 39:36.576
- I READ REALLY SLOW.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.568
- WELL, WHERE THE HECK
DO YOU THINK I'M GOIN'?

39:38.680 --> 39:40.409
I GOT NOTHIN' ELSE TO DO.

39:40.510 --> 39:44.196
MY GOSH, WE'VE GOT
TO GET THOSE GASKETS IN.

39:44.310 --> 39:46.028
SO, KNOW WHAT?
JUST START RIGHT THERE.

39:46.140 --> 39:48.791
WHAT'S THAT SAY?

39:48.900 --> 39:50.037
- [deep breath]

39:50.140 --> 39:54.315
"REMOVE FRONT

39:54.420 --> 39:58.766
ADJUSTER--ADJUSTERS."

39:58.870 --> 39:59.802
- OH, MY GOSH.

39:59.910 --> 40:00.490
THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT
TO TAKE THE ENGINE

40:00.600 --> 40:02.329
OUT AND THE TRANSMISSION.

40:02.430 --> 40:04.318
THAT'S A WEEK'S WORK.

40:04.430 --> 40:08.639
- I'M MAKIN'
A BEAUTIFUL DAY

40:08.750 --> 40:09.182
GONNA DRIVE MY CAR

40:09.300 --> 40:10.198
- HEY, BUDDY.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.461
- DAD TOLD ME THAT
YOU PASSED UP

40:12.580 --> 40:14.366
ON A BIG CAMPAIGN DONATION,
AND YOU'RE REALLY UPSET,

40:14.480 --> 40:17.051
SO I SHOULDN'T BUG YOU
ABOUT DINNER.

40:17.170 --> 40:19.991
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

40:20.100 --> 40:22.512
YOU WOULD PASS UP ON MONEY,
BUT HE SAID

40:22.620 --> 40:24.929
THAT IT'S REALLY COOL
THAT YOU DID.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.065
- THAT WAS VERY NICE OF HIM
TO SAY.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.648
DID HE EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHY I PASSED UP ON THE MONEY?

40:29.770 --> 40:31.931
- HE SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE
IN BED WITH HARRY LERNER.

40:32.050 --> 40:33.381
AND THEN I SAID THAT
I WOULDN'T WANT

40:33.500 --> 40:34.876
HARRY LERNER
IN MY BED EITHER.

40:34.980 --> 40:35.969
AND THEN HE SAID THAT
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A METAPHOR,

40:36.080 --> 40:40.221
AND THEN TOLD ME
TO GO PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

40:40.330 --> 40:41.638
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
POLITICS CAN BE

40:41.740 --> 40:43.321
PRETTY COMPLICATED SOMETIMES.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.839
- I KNOW.
I WAS PRESIDENT.

40:44.950 --> 40:46.224
- THAT'S TRUE,
YOU WERE PRESIDENT.

40:46.340 --> 40:49.229
A VERY GOOD PRESIDENT.
AT THAT.

40:49.340 --> 40:52.161
- ARE YOU GONNA DROP OUT
OF THE RACE?

40:54.860 --> 40:56.828
- I DON'T WANT
TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE,

40:56.930 --> 40:58.238
BUT, YOU KNOW, WITH--
WITHOUT MONEY,

40:58.350 --> 41:00.898
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO RUN FOR MAYOR.

41:01.010 --> 41:02.557
SO I-I DON'T KNOW.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.548
- YOU'D PROBABLY MAKE
A GOOD MAYOR, THOUGH.

41:04.660 --> 41:07.732
BETTER THAN BOB LITTLE.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.148
- THANKS, BUDDY,
THAT MEANS A LOT.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.810
- I'M GONNA SUPPORT
YOUR CAMPAIGN, I THINK,

41:11.910 --> 41:14.151
UNTIL I CAN CONDUCT
MORE RESEARCH.

41:14.260 --> 41:16.251
AND THEN I'M GONNA DECIDE
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU

41:16.370 --> 41:18.179
ONCE I HAVE MORE INFORMATION
ON THE OTHER CANDIDATE.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.779
- WELL, I SO APPRECIATE YOU

41:19.890 --> 41:22.848
GIVING ME THE BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT, I DO.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.027
WHAT'S THIS?

41:27.130 --> 41:28.449
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

41:28.550 --> 41:29.448
- HANK TOLD ME THAT
I COULD HAVE $20

41:29.550 --> 41:31.199
IF I COULD SHUT UP
FOR ONE FULL HOUR.

41:31.310 --> 41:36.441
- [snickers]
- AND THEN I DID.

41:36.560 --> 41:40.417
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
DROP OUT OF THE RACE.

41:40.530 --> 41:45.877
- AND THAT'S GONNA BE
MY BEAUTIFUL DAY

41:45.980 --> 41:49.086
OH, OH-OH-OH

41:49.190 --> 41:52.182
MY, MY

41:52.300 --> 41:55.884
I'M LEARNING TO FLY

41:55.990 --> 41:58.743
HEY, HEY

41:58.860 --> 42:00.361
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?

42:00.480 --> 42:05.201
LET'S NOT FORGET
WE'RE ALIVE

42:05.310 --> 42:09.132
WE'RE ALIVE
