17:24.782 --> 17:27.046
like, trembling in my bed?
No. I'm not going back there.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.135
- I'm getting a sense--
was there physical abuse?

17:29.178 --> 17:30.875
- I was literally
four or five years old,

17:30.919 --> 17:32.790
and I saw my mother's
bloody face

17:32.834 --> 17:34.662
'cause my father was
beating her up, and she says,

17:34.705 --> 17:37.578
"Please call the police.
Please call."

17:37.621 --> 17:39.884
And I go, "But Mommy, I don't
know how to use the phone."

17:39.928 --> 17:42.148
I remember that
at four or five.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.325
And there's other things
I don't want to go into.

17:45.368 --> 17:48.676
But one of the reasons why
I was very independent in life

17:48.719 --> 17:50.286
is 'cause I remember
having this conversation

17:50.330 --> 17:51.592
at 12 or 13 years old.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.115
"Mommy, why are you
with Daddy?"

17:53.159 --> 17:54.682
And she goes,
"I have no choice.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.379
I have four kids."
- Oh, no.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.077
- And there was no
domestic abuse centers then.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.731
SAFE Centers.
There was no SAFE Center.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.994
No. It was bad.
- You know, I--

18:03.038 --> 18:04.431
- Just really bad.
You have no idea.

18:04.474 --> 18:05.736
- I had no idea.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.738
- My brother who died?

18:07.782 --> 18:10.785
He was an alcoholic,
and my middle sister?

18:10.828 --> 18:12.830
She has a bit
of a drinking problem.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.658
My therapist said
the only thing that saved me

18:14.702 --> 18:15.920
was I was the eldest,

18:15.964 --> 18:17.748
so my mother gave me
a lot of responsibility.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.881
I was like the second mother,
and I read books.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.143
I put myself into books.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.710
I would read eight books
a night till, like,

18:22.753 --> 18:26.017
4:00 in the morning,
to just escape.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.107
I'm numb to things.
I don't always pay attention.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.847
- What I was gonna say.
- I zone out.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.501
On TV, they go,
"Don't you notice the cameras?"

18:31.545 --> 18:33.199
I don't notice the cameras.
Like, when I grew up,

18:33.242 --> 18:34.809
I didn't notice my father was
screaming and yelling

18:34.852 --> 18:36.637
and beating up my mother.
I blocked it out.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.855
So when we're being filmed,

18:37.899 --> 18:39.379
I don't even know
there's a camera on me.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.556
<i>- This is something
I had no idea about.</i>

18:42.599 --> 18:44.253
It explains a lot.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.082
I feel like you also
don't like to show

18:47.126 --> 18:48.953
a vulnerable side of yourself.
- Yes.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.868
I feel I'll be weak.

18:50.912 --> 18:54.785
<i>- I think that Ramona
probably, growing up,</i>

18:54.829 --> 18:56.831
tuned a lot out.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.267
<i>I think that's
what she does now.</i>

18:58.311 --> 19:00.269
She could be offending you,
hurting you,

19:00.313 --> 19:02.358
get in a fight with you,
and then she just tunes it out.

19:02.402 --> 19:03.794
She doesn't deal with things,

19:03.838 --> 19:05.666
but however she navigated
through that then

19:05.709 --> 19:07.624
is not working for her now
as an adult.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.845
You know, last night when
we were sitting at the table,

19:10.888 --> 19:13.108
Kenya was, like, suggesting,
you know,

19:13.152 --> 19:16.242
maybe that John
would like Luann.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.815
- Sometimes you're so all
over the place and you're like,

19:24.859 --> 19:26.643
"Oh, blah, blah, blah,"
that when I saw you,

19:26.687 --> 19:28.297
like, still,
and you weren't listening

19:28.341 --> 19:29.994
I literally got
a little lump in my throat,

19:30.038 --> 19:31.474
'cause I looked at you,
and I was like,

19:31.518 --> 19:33.215
I could tell you were hurt.
- No, it did bother me.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.435
I thought it was just, like,
crossing a line.

19:35.478 --> 19:38.307
It wasn't necessary,
and it's like, really?

19:38.351 --> 19:41.005
It's really important for me,
no matter where I go to,

19:41.049 --> 19:43.660
and when I leave
to have no regrets.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.141
<i>Kenya pushed buttons in me
that brought me back.</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:48.883
- You just said
you were flirting with him.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.146
- Yeah, 'cause I was getting
divorced, bitch!

19:51.190 --> 19:52.495
- Excuse me?

19:52.539 --> 19:54.193
- 'Cause you don't understand
anything I say!

19:54.236 --> 19:56.282
Oh, you.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.327
- Who the do you think
you are, Ramona?

19:58.371 --> 19:59.502
- I don't know.
- Don't talk to me like that.

19:59.546 --> 20:00.634
- I had too much tequila.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.244
I felt like being around Kenya

20:02.288 --> 20:04.986
was being in my negative home
environment, like my father.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.253
- I wasn't lashing out.
How was I lashing out?

20:11.297 --> 20:12.863
- Why don't tonight...
- Yeah.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.996
- Like, we started
this all together.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.302
- Right.
- Why don't you end it

20:16.345 --> 20:18.129
on a good note with her?
- Oh, no. I'd like to.

20:18.173 --> 20:19.261
- And say, you know--
- Okay. Let me practice.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.654
Will you tell me
if it's sincere?

20:20.697 --> 20:21.959
- We'll tell you
if it's sincere.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.178
- Okay, I'm gonna just,
like, dig deep.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.484
- Okay.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.573
- Kenya, I really don't know

20:26.616 --> 20:28.270
quite what happened between us,

20:28.314 --> 20:31.839
but I know really
not good stuff happened,

20:31.882 --> 20:34.581
and I'm sure
I'm a lot responsible,

20:34.624 --> 20:37.061
but I was really, really
looking forward to meeting you,

20:37.105 --> 20:38.715
like, tremendously,

20:38.759 --> 20:42.066
and I am upset that I never
really got to know who you are.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.068
I see how you interact
with the other women,

20:44.112 --> 20:46.070
and I wish you and I
had that together.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.421
Obviously, I did certain things
that push you away,

20:48.464 --> 20:50.161
and now I'm gonna cry,

20:50.205 --> 20:52.251
but I really--'cause I really
want to get to know her,

20:52.294 --> 20:54.427
because she grew up
without love from her mother.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.080
I grew up without love
of my father,

20:56.124 --> 20:57.386
so I thought we had
some commonality.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.910
Maybe we're both similar.
We both are strong.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.565
We try to hide ourselves.
I-I-I don't know.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.263
- But can you also say
that hurt you, last night?

21:04.306 --> 21:05.786
- No. I'm not going that far.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.309
- Why not?
- Because I'm not.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.311
- Life filters people out
of your life for a reason.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.921
- Right.
- But that shouldn't stop you

21:10.965 --> 21:12.401
from being authentic
and believable.

21:12.445 --> 21:13.707
- Okay.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.274
- 'Cause I want us
to all end on a good note.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.406
- No, I do too,
but I don't like rejection.

21:17.450 --> 21:20.279

Make it come from your heart,

35:16.766 --> 35:18.507
You're not afraid
to speak your mind.

35:18.551 --> 35:21.031
I was, like, scared to say
to you something,

35:21.075 --> 35:22.990
'cause I thought, like,
maybe you'd attack me.

35:23.033 --> 35:27.255
- Okay, so she's playing
the victim card again.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.301
Tread very carefully.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.998
- I was ner--
okay, I was nervous.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.347
- Okay.
- I was nervous.

35:32.391 --> 35:34.175
- Wait, you weren't afraid
to call me a bitch.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.698
- Well, no,
'cause you know what?

35:35.742 --> 35:37.091
- You've gotta be honest
in this conversation.

35:37.135 --> 35:41.443
- No, somehow, you triggered
something within me.

35:41.487 --> 35:42.792
It wasn't maybe you.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.533
It was something within me
that made me react,

35:44.577 --> 35:46.666
and I don't know why I reacted
the way I did,

35:46.709 --> 35:48.363
'cause I don't normally say
that to someone I don't know.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.931
- You know, for me,
it was like a slap in my face,

35:50.974 --> 35:53.194
because I'm like,
"Well, I was trying," you know?

35:53.238 --> 35:54.500
- I'm not that person.
- Mm-hmm.

35:54.543 --> 35:56.023
- That's what I'm trying
to say.

35:56.066 --> 36:00.245
I'm upset with myself
how I butted heads with you.

36:01.507 --> 36:02.551
- What do you think's
going on over there?

36:02.595 --> 36:03.770
I mean, they're taking
a long time.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.119
- Well, I like that it's taking
a while,

36:05.163 --> 36:06.642
because if it was too
quick, that's not good.

36:06.686 --> 36:09.819
- Kyle and I were talking
to her today, and she's like,

36:09.863 --> 36:11.821
"I always wanted
to get to know Kenya,

36:11.865 --> 36:13.388
and it just got off
on the wrong foot."

36:13.432 --> 36:15.347
- Oh, well--
- She teared up.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.131
- She did?
- Yeah she did. Real tears.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.089
- Really?
- No, they were.

36:19.133 --> 36:22.441
- You were the person I really
knew the least,

36:22.484 --> 36:25.444
and I really wanted
to get to know you.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.141
And one of the things
I wanted to kind of, like,

36:27.185 --> 36:28.621
share on the side with you,

36:28.664 --> 36:30.884
if you wanted to talk about it
was that, you know,

36:30.927 --> 36:33.713
you and I have a little bit of
similar backgrounds growing up,

36:33.756 --> 36:36.716
because you had a mother who,
you know, wasn't there for you.

36:36.759 --> 36:39.762
And even though my father
was in my home physically,

36:39.806 --> 36:41.808
I got no love
from him either.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.725
- I don't know
your whole story,

36:45.768 --> 36:48.293
but just the things
that you've shared I think

36:48.336 --> 36:51.861
that we could possibly connect
on those things.

36:51.905 --> 36:56.083
My mom--she has never
acknowledged me my whole life.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.085
- Oh, my God.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.872
<i>- Hello? Hi.</i>

37:02.916 --> 37:04.047
- She's done this before?

37:04.091 --> 37:05.614
- Oh, I've done
this a million times.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.095
You know, it's a waste of time.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.404
- I heard you lock the door.

37:14.144 --> 37:16.408
She gave me to my grandmother.
She signed the papers--

37:16.451 --> 37:17.670
May I ask how old you were
at that time?

37:17.713 --> 37:19.193
- Three days.
- Three days old?

37:19.237 --> 37:21.108
- Mm-hmm. She never named me.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.763
She didn't want to have
anything to do with me.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.982
- We learn love
from our parents.

37:26.026 --> 37:28.289
Your mother teaches you
how to love.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.421
- Mm-hmm.
- And then the father

37:29.464 --> 37:30.900
teaches you how to
love another man.

37:30.944 --> 37:33.512
So I had a very difficult time
finding relationships.

37:33.555 --> 37:37.690
I would pick men that wouldn't
connect on purpose.

37:37.733 --> 37:38.821
- Yeah,
emotionally unavailable.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.301
It's the same thing
that I do now,

37:40.345 --> 37:42.738
and that's why I'm in this
situation with my husband.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.914
Through therapy I learned that,
yeah,

37:44.958 --> 37:48.527
that is a direct correlation
on my mother's situation.

37:48.570 --> 37:51.312
Because she was never
emotionally available to me.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.445
- Jerk portobello
and Capri salad.

37:53.488 --> 37:55.142
- Oh, I'll try it. Yeah.
- They're good.

37:55.185 --> 37:56.317
You will love it.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.666
- Thank you, honey.
- You're welcome.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.015
- I have a question
I want to ask everybody.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.495
This is the one I've been
wanting to ask the most.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.889
- Really?
- Did you have a misconception

38:02.932 --> 38:04.717
about people, and then,
all of a sudden,

38:04.760 --> 38:06.675
you feel totally different
about, or not really?

38:06.719 --> 38:07.937
- Kenya.

38:07.981 --> 38:09.461
You know,
'cause people kept saying

38:09.504 --> 38:11.289
she's a drama queen, and--

38:11.332 --> 38:12.812
- Literally, like, all of you
asked me about her.

38:12.855 --> 38:14.335
- Right.
- Everybody called me up

38:14.379 --> 38:15.467
and was like,
"What about Kenya?"

38:15.510 --> 38:17.643
- I am a very forgiving person.

38:17.686 --> 38:19.558
I don't really hold on
to grudges

38:19.601 --> 38:21.864
when people are accountable
for their actions.

38:21.908 --> 38:25.041
I actually respect
that more than anything else.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.217
I won't hold a grudge
against you.

38:27.261 --> 38:29.829
- I appreciate that.
- No. I won't. I promise you.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.352
The only thing that would
bring us backwards

38:31.396 --> 38:32.701
is the same behavior...

38:32.745 --> 38:34.703
- I understand.
- Showing itself again.

38:34.747 --> 38:38.141
No one is perfect, but you have
to show that you're growing.

38:38.185 --> 38:41.449
Not going berserk on the plane
on you, for me,

38:41.493 --> 38:43.451
that was a lot of growth.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.410
- Well, thank you for that.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.281
I appreciate that.
- No, I'm so serious.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.849
- I'm really glad that Kenya
and I had this conversation,

38:49.892 --> 38:52.199
and I feel like we both
have come to

38:52.242 --> 38:55.507
understand each other better
and can build a friendship.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.422
- I think what you need, too,
is a hug.

38:57.465 --> 38:58.684
- You know what?
I do need a hug.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.338
Oh, my God.
Thank you for saying that.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.775
Okay. Oh, my gosh.
Thank you, Kenya.

39:02.818 --> 39:04.211
- You just need a hug
sometimes.

39:04.254 --> 39:05.604
- Thank you for this hug.

39:05.647 --> 39:06.953
- You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.520
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.261
<i>- There's a lack of love
in Ramona's life.</i>

39:11.305 --> 39:13.960
She's seeking attention any way
that she can get it.

39:14.003 --> 39:16.832
I'm starting to peel
back the layer

39:16.876 --> 39:19.705
and to see
who really is Ramona.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.184
And that feels really good,

39:21.228 --> 39:25.058
because the path to any
friendship is common ground.

39:25.101 --> 39:27.321
- My biggest misconception
about the group

39:27.365 --> 39:28.714
I would have to say Teresa.

39:28.757 --> 39:32.848
I've found you to be so sweet
and sensitive

39:32.892 --> 39:34.284
and just so down-to-earth.

39:34.328 --> 39:37.549
- It takes a lot to get me mad,
but you know,

39:37.592 --> 39:41.553
I have not enjoyed
one season on my show.

39:41.596 --> 39:44.425
And so this is the first time

39:44.469 --> 39:47.994
that I actually liked
being on TV,

39:48.037 --> 39:51.867
and it was about, like, women
empowerment and real bonding.

39:51.911 --> 39:53.565
Not knocking each other down.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.610
- It's probably 100% true,

39:55.654 --> 39:58.744
because from season one
till now,

39:58.787 --> 40:01.616
it was--you dealt with,
like, the bankruptcy.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.922
Then you dealt with Joe,

40:02.965 --> 40:04.184
and then you dealt
with your parents,

40:04.227 --> 40:05.620
and you dealt
with your other parent.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.405
Then you dealt
with the deportation,

40:07.448 --> 40:09.145
and then, this year--
- Yeah.

40:09.189 --> 40:10.756
It was one thing after another.
- I thought this year was good.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.627
But it was still your dad
even this year.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.673
And I'm like,
"Now she has, like"--

40:14.716 --> 40:18.372
I feel like it's like
you've come to a place

40:18.416 --> 40:20.635
where it's all
pretty much over.

40:20.679 --> 40:22.637
- It's a new moon.
- I think it's just my time

40:22.681 --> 40:24.204
to shine finally.
- Exactly.

40:24.247 --> 40:26.424
- But it took a long time.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.208
- We're back.
- We're back.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.253
Sorry. We're back.

40:30.297 --> 40:32.517
- That sounds like a good,
uplifting voice.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.779
- Yes. I'm smiling.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.520
- Oh, good.
- Yay. I like that.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.696
- Do you feel better, guys,
about each other?

40:37.739 --> 40:39.262
- Yeah. You know.

40:39.306 --> 40:40.829
- We talked it out.
- It's good to talk.

40:40.873 --> 40:43.484
<i>- I find it very interesting
that Kenya could</i>

40:43.528 --> 40:47.793
find it in her heart to have
a heart-to-heart with Ramona,

40:47.836 --> 40:52.058
but her good buddy
over here for years?

40:52.101 --> 40:54.408
<i>Nothing.</i>

40:54.452 --> 40:56.236
At least she was consistent.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.977
- Why didn't I do this
four days ago?

40:58.020 --> 40:59.718
- Yeah.
- Shmuck. Shmuck.

40:59.761 --> 41:02.547
- Well, I don't think Kenya
was ready four days ago,

41:02.590 --> 41:03.809
but she's ready now.
- Yeah.

41:03.852 --> 41:06.072
- I think it took the week.

41:06.115 --> 41:08.509
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers to that.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.119
- Amen.
- Like, positivity.

41:10.163 --> 41:12.470
- Women supporting women.
- Absolutely. Cheers.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.080
- Okay, I'm gonna
go around and say

41:14.123 --> 41:16.430
what surprised me the most
about somebody, and I'll start.

41:16.474 --> 41:20.521
Kyle, I mean, I never expected
you to be as funny as you are.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.001
- Really?
- Really.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.524
- Yeah. You're really cool.
- 'Cause I love humor,

41:23.568 --> 41:25.178
and I love that
you love my jokes.

41:25.221 --> 41:27.310
- We love an audience.
- We love an audience.

41:27.354 --> 41:30.400
- For Teresa, I didn't realize
how smart she is.

41:30.444 --> 41:33.969
- Whoa.
From scarecrow to smart.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.231
- Don't repeat the negative.

41:35.275 --> 41:37.712
- Thank you.
Don't repeat the negative.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.453
- I didn't know
Melissa was so sexy.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.846
- Right?

41:40.889 --> 41:42.108
- I mean I knew she was
beautiful and stuff,

41:42.151 --> 41:45.503
but I didn't know
she was sexy and fun.

41:45.546 --> 41:47.200
- Fun! Fun! Yes, fun.

41:47.243 --> 41:49.942
- Funny and pretty
is an outstanding combination.

41:49.985 --> 41:52.031
- Thank you.
I like to enjoy life.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.423
- Yes.

41:53.467 --> 41:54.903
- I'll be right back.
My eyelash is stuck again.

41:54.947 --> 41:57.036
- So tug of war. Tug of war.

41:57.079 --> 41:59.255
The strategy that you did,
Kenya,

41:59.299 --> 42:01.519
like, getting on
your butt worked twice.

42:01.562 --> 42:03.346
- We were sitting there
sipping our margaritas,

42:03.390 --> 42:05.566
and Lu was getting
flopped around like a ragdoll.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.699
I mean, her glasses
were buried in the sand.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.048
- They were.
- I was like--

42:09.091 --> 42:10.789
- You planted your butt,
and she was like--

42:10.832 --> 42:12.747
she's like, "No, no. Not fair."

42:13.661 --> 42:15.663
- Hello.

42:15.707 --> 42:17.273
- I'll show you

42:17.317 --> 42:19.624
- Awesome.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.669
So I'm just gonna change,

42:21.713 --> 42:23.105
and I'll show you
exactly what to do.

42:23.149 --> 42:25.586
- Where's Luann?

42:25.630 --> 42:26.631
- Smoking her vapor.

42:29.634 --> 42:31.592
- Are these filled with money?

42:31.636 --> 42:34.029
I can't figure it out.

42:34.073 --> 42:36.249
How does Britney do it?

42:36.292 --> 42:38.860
- I'm gonna detox tomorrow.
- Oh, I'm done.

42:38.904 --> 42:40.688
- Anyone else gonna detox
for a week

42:40.732 --> 42:42.516
from salt, margaritas, vodka?

42:42.560 --> 42:45.040
- Okay. The music's starting.

42:45.084 --> 42:46.825
This is gonna be a disaster.

42:51.133 --> 42:52.308
- Remember,
the arms are gonna go up.

42:52.352 --> 42:53.875
- No way.

42:53.919 --> 42:55.442
- Money can't buy you--
she's singing.

42:55.485 --> 42:58.097
- Money can't--oh, it's Luann!
- Ahh!

42:58.140 --> 43:00.926
Oh!
