00:01.330 --> 00:03.264
COOPER: Previously on
The Blacklist...

00:03.300 --> 00:04.665
SAKIYA:
I found something.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.793
A fingerprint on the corner
of the imam's desk.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.933
Belongs to a man who's been
in prison for 15 years.

00:08.970 --> 00:10.437
Arturo Ruel.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.506
About my chart.
RESSLER: I didn't look at it.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.905
REDDINGTON: I'd appreciate
if you didn't mention

00:13.940 --> 00:15.476
anything about it
to Elizabeth.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.168
Who are you?

00:17.210 --> 00:20.179
How about you let me ask
the questions?

00:20.220 --> 00:21.278
DEMBE: Raymond!

00:21.320 --> 00:24.187
**

00:38.030 --> 00:40.828
KATARINA: Why do you
trust the words
of men so faithfully.

00:40.870 --> 00:43.634
They weren't mere men.
They were prophets.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.103
They gave us
the word of Allah.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.168
How do you know Allah
has anything to do

00:48.210 --> 00:50.178
with what's in that book?

00:50.210 --> 00:51.438
Faith.

00:52.250 --> 00:55.048
I'm also
a person of faith.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.014
I have faith
in myself.

00:57.990 --> 01:00.686
Faith in false prophets

01:00.720 --> 01:02.654
is worse
than no faith at all.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.789
We're both innocents

01:06.830 --> 01:10.197
caught in someone else's
web of deceit.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.766
Raymond Reddington's.

01:12.870 --> 01:14.098
How could you know that?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.230
The same way
I know who you are.

01:17.270 --> 01:19.579
Dembe.
(SCOFFS)

01:19.610 --> 01:21.077
You're his
father confessor.

01:21.110 --> 01:24.409
Which is why I will
never betray his confidence.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.008
Even to save my life.

01:28.950 --> 01:30.417
I don't know
how to do that.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.554
No. But Dembe does.

01:32.590 --> 01:35.150
And if_ he's conﬁded
In you...
I am bound to secrecy.

01:35.190 --> 01:38.580
Even if it kills me.
That's what your
faith requires?

01:38.630 --> 01:41.724
My faith requires me
to pray for you.

01:41.760 --> 01:44.820
Your faith
is a death sentence!

01:44.870 --> 01:47.589
Why should I honor your faith
if it doesn't honor me?

01:47.640 --> 01:51.462
You honor faith because
without it, you are lost.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.407
Is Dembe faithful?

01:58.750 --> 02:00.741
He is.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.616
(SCOFFS) I wonder.

02:05.950 --> 02:07.952
Clearly the prospect
of my death

02:07.990 --> 02:09.252
doesn't shake your faith.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.281
**

02:14.930 --> 02:18.366
How about we see
if the prospect
of yours shakes his.

02:21.900 --> 02:23.800
Why don't you
pray on that?

02:23.840 --> 02:26.172
**

02:33.550 --> 02:36.815
Vitals are...okay.

02:36.850 --> 02:39.489
(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)
Pulse.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.459
You need an MRI
as well as a CT-scan.

02:43.490 --> 02:46.197
(MUFFLED
INDISTINCT SPEECH)

02:49.830 --> 02:51.468
Raymond.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.297
Hey. Are you listening?
(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING STOPS)

02:55.000 --> 02:56.706
Maybe you can get him
to listen to reason.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.537
That's unlikely,
but I will try.

02:58.570 --> 03:01.277
Try hard.
His life depends on it.

03:08.150 --> 03:11.688
(CHUCKLES) What?
Everyone knows
wine is dehydrating.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.278
If you won't get help
for yourself...

03:13.320 --> 03:15.151
Sakiya.
Did she find something?

03:15.190 --> 03:17.283
...then get it
for the people
who love you.

03:18.330 --> 03:19.922
Does she have a lead?

03:19.960 --> 03:22.497
She does.
But it makes no sense.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.959
We were wrong.
I was wrong.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.800
Imam Asmal
was not abducted
by extremists

03:29.840 --> 03:32.673
or because he's involved
With extremists.

03:32.710 --> 03:37.204
Dembe knew that,
and I ignored his counsel.

03:37.250 --> 03:41.368
I can only hope that won't
prove to be a fatal mistake.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.944
You say you have a lead.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.414
One of my cleaners
went back over the scene
of the abduction,

03:46.460 --> 03:48.485
and she lifted DNA

03:48.520 --> 03:52.490
from a fingerprint she found
on the imam's desk.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.725
Aram,
if you would be so kind.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.188
Meet Arturo Ruel.

03:58.230 --> 04:01.768
His resume includes
two stints at Wallens

04:01.800 --> 04:06.430
for carrying out
targeted kidnappings
in the US and Mexico.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.038
What's his connection
to the imam?

04:08.080 --> 04:09.274
None.

04:09.310 --> 04:12.199
We can circle back to the why
after we figure out the how.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.514
The two stretches at Wallens?

04:14.550 --> 04:16.245
He's doing one of them
right now.

04:20.090 --> 04:24.356
(METAL CLANGING)
It does provide us
with quite an engaging riddle.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.722
Maybe the print
was planted to throw us off.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.591
Why plant a print
that belongs to a man

04:28.630 --> 04:30.097
_who has _ _
an Ironclad aIIbI?

04:30.130 --> 04:32.963
Yes, I love
a good locked-door mystery!

04:33.000 --> 04:36.561
_ Where the victim
IS kIlled lnSIde a room
no one has access to.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.702
LIZ: This is one better.

04:37.740 --> 04:40.072
The criminal is inside a room
no one can get out of.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.169
Ressler, Keen,
get over to Wallens.

04:42.210 --> 04:43.404
I'll reach out
to the warden,

04:43.450 --> 04:44.940
let him know you're coming
to speak with Ruel.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.073
I'd like a list
of all the prisoners

04:47.120 --> 04:50.339
who have been housed there
in the last six months.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.257
Ruel may not have
had a connection
to Imam Asmal,

04:53.290 --> 04:54.985
but perhaps
someone else does.

04:55.860 --> 04:56.929
Consider it done.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.652
MAN: How is this
even pOSSIble?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.224
That's exactly what
we're trying
to figure out.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.524
And you're sure
it's his DNA?
Without a doubt.

05:03.570 --> 05:06.664
Arturo Ruel has spent the last
three years in isolation.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.999
He's 23/7. He don't talk,
he don't see the sun,

05:10.040 --> 05:11.405
he's like a vampire.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.772
His DNA would suggest
otherwise.

05:13.810 --> 05:14.834
Maybe he was framed.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.643
For all we know,
he morphed into a bat

05:16.680 --> 05:17.942
and he flew
to the crIme scene,

05:17.980 --> 05:19.447
but we're not
gonna know for sure

05:19.480 --> 05:21.448
until we talk
to Ruel himself.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.947
Well, then, by all means,

05:22.990 --> 05:25.242
let's go get
the little critter
out of his cave.

05:28.190 --> 05:31.284
LIZ: Mr. Ruel, thank you
for agreeing to speak with us.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.548
Who says I'm talking?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.955
I'm here for the view.
(RESSLER CHUCKLES)

05:36.000 --> 05:38.969
Yeah, I know I'm pretty,
but you're not my type.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.934
So how about you tell us
why we found your print

05:40.970 --> 05:43.131
at a crime scene
less than 48 hours ago?

05:43.170 --> 05:45.035
Don't know.
What'd I do?

05:45.070 --> 05:47.038
RESSLER: I don't think
you did anything.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.401
I think you were
in that little
concrete box of yours.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.701
So I'm free to go, no?

05:50.750 --> 05:52.342
LIZ: You're free
to be charged
with kidnapping.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.473
And depending on
where the victim is,

05:54.520 --> 05:56.317
and what condition he's in,
you could be looking at

05:56.350 --> 05:58.716
anything from assault
to murder by the time
we're through.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.889
Oh... Well,
put it on my tab.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.684
So why don't
you just tell us
who set you up?

06:05.390 --> 06:06.391
May I?

06:09.530 --> 06:11.464
Tell you what.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.697
This is my agent
in Tepito.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.435
Call and ask
why his cartel

06:16.470 --> 06:19.701
is letting me rot here
in the States.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.672
Once he answers that,

06:21.710 --> 06:23.473
well, I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know

06:23.510 --> 06:26.843
about my prints and wherever
you think they were found.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.519
But until then, well...

06:30.890 --> 06:34.417
...tuck tail and go.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.657
(LAUGHS)

06:39.390 --> 06:42.496
RESSLER:
He can laugh all he wants,
but the kid's gonna help us.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.418
Why do you say that?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.867
RESSLER: It seems like
our friend Ruel

06:48.900 --> 06:50.606
knows how to get
through a locked door.

06:53.610 --> 06:55.931
ANGLIM: Trial started
two weeks ago.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.278
I thought our people
would have it taken
care of by now.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.119
MAN:
Tell me about the girl.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.141
Case rests
on her testimony.

07:03.220 --> 07:04.847
She saw it happen.

07:04.890 --> 07:07.085
State plans to call her up
first thing Monday.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.680
Not enough time.
I understand that.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.186
And I was under
the impression that we could

07:11.230 --> 07:12.492
handle this on our own,

07:12.530 --> 07:13.929
but that's not the case.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.599
This lady, her testimony,

07:16.630 --> 07:18.962
it's about a lot more
than a murder.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.230
Who's the kid?
Collateral damage.

07:21.270 --> 07:22.294
They're keeping
the two of them

07:22.340 --> 07:23.602
at a federal safe house.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.039
Heavily guarded.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.674
It's too fast.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.200
Which is
why I came to you.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.844
I got less
than 48 hours.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.768
I have it on good authority
that doesn't matter.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.415
I heard you have access
to people...

07:34.450 --> 07:36.611
People with
special skills

07:36.650 --> 07:38.845
who can help
in short situations like this.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.448
Can you do that or not?

07:40.490 --> 07:43.084
You and I
need to talk money,

07:43.130 --> 07:45.257
but, yeah,
we can take care of the lady.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.898
First we take care
of the money.

07:47.930 --> 07:50.728
**

07:53.170 --> 07:56.503
**

08:03.010 --> 08:05.740
A list of prisoners
in and out
of Wallens Ridge

08:05.780 --> 08:07.179
in the last year.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.643
Hmm. Where are you
on Arturo Ruel?

08:09.690 --> 08:13.182
He's willing to talk.
We're working
on immunity now.

08:13.220 --> 08:16.087
New hangout?
The chef is a friend.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.656
He needed an investor,

08:17.690 --> 08:20.955
and I need his pumpkin
pepper vichyssoise.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.719
You bought a restaurant
so you could eat vichyssoise?

08:23.770 --> 08:26.637
I bought a restaurant
because I can.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.888
A privilege
you will soon enjoy.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.101
I don't like vichyssoise.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.732
Plus the name
is terrible.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.031
It sounds like
a Nazi collaborator.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.672
(LAUGHS)

08:35.710 --> 08:36.938
Chicken soup then.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.641
Lobster bisque.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.114
Whatever you'd like
wherever you'd like it.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.641
As soon as
the transntlon IS complete.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.852
What transition?
Of assets.

08:46.890 --> 08:49.051
From me to you.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.149
I think
it's almost time.

08:51.190 --> 08:54.125
Yeah,
that's not happening.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.663
There are quite a few people
to be taken care of.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.691
Dembe and others.

08:58.730 --> 09:00.789
It's a fairly
substantial list,

09:00.840 --> 09:02.535
but arrangements
have been made.

09:02.570 --> 09:04.231
Protocols put in place.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.409
Most things
will take care of themselves.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.135
But there are
a lot of assets.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.000
Billions of assets.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.247
Of which,
to a great degree,
you'll be in control.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.214
Of a criminal empire?

09:15.250 --> 09:16.717
I'm an FBI agent!

09:16.750 --> 09:19.412
You're also the daughter
of Katarina Rostova.

09:19.450 --> 09:21.384
Believe me,
it's not what
I had hoped for,

09:21.420 --> 09:23.786
or what I had planned for.

09:23.830 --> 09:27.220
But as the good book says,
man plans. God laughs.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.388
If it's not what you planned,
why do it? What changed?

09:30.430 --> 09:32.364
Destiny. Fate.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.493
Me. You.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.337
Marvin Gerard.

09:36.370 --> 09:38.235
Your lawyer.
He's at Wallens?

09:38.270 --> 09:40.374
Got out three months ago.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.105
Haven't spoken since.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.405
Perhaps it's time
to mend that fence.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.449
I got your message,
what's going on?

09:49.480 --> 09:50.913
Situation with Ruel.

09:50.950 --> 09:53.748
No, Ruel
kept his mouth shut.
That's what I thought.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.189
But we caught this
on surveillance.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.253
(SIGHS)

10:01.300 --> 10:02.892
Talk to the boys.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.227
Take care of it.

10:05.670 --> 10:08.059
Marvin, nobody
abandoned you.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.397
I went to prison.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.432
You were in prison
before I broke
you out of prison

10:12.470 --> 10:13.607
to come work for me.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.574
The only reason
you were walking free

10:15.610 --> 10:16.975
is because I got you out.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.399
Three years, Raymond.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.247
Three years
I'll never get back.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.316
Marvin, what do you
want me to say?

10:23.350 --> 10:27.184
Becky hit menopause
while I was
in that bird cage.

10:27.220 --> 10:30.087
We wanted kids,
but if you must know,

10:30.130 --> 10:33.622
I had performance anxiety
during our conjugal visits.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.548
Do you have any more
Fun Foam Putty?

10:36.600 --> 10:37.794
I need it in blue.

10:37.830 --> 10:39.969
Uh, all of our Fun Foam Putty
is at the end of that aisle.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.639
Yeah, I didn't see blue.
Then we're out.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.932
You wanna check
in the back?

10:44.970 --> 10:46.403
No, I don't want to check
in the back, ma'am.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.873
I just told you
it's at the end
of the aisle.

10:47.910 --> 10:49.502
If you don't see it,
we're either out

10:49.540 --> 10:51.178
or you're not looking
hard enough.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.743
(SIGHS)
Marvin, listen,

10:55.780 --> 10:58.613
you went to prison,
you kept my relationship

10:58.650 --> 11:00.459
with the Task Force
to yourself.

11:00.490 --> 11:02.685
I appreciate that.
I am in your debt.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.958
Is that why you're here?

11:06.130 --> 11:08.451
No. I'm here because
I need information

11:08.500 --> 11:10.297
about the prison
where you served.

11:10.330 --> 11:13.060
Wallens Ridge, something's
happening inside those walls,

11:13.100 --> 11:14.135
and I need to...

11:14.170 --> 11:15.592
I'm afraid I gotta stop you
right there, pal.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.460
I can't assist you.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.636
Why not?

11:18.670 --> 11:20.638
Because I am working
in a toy store!

11:20.680 --> 11:22.636
I'll give you money.
Whatever you need.

11:22.680 --> 11:26.138
This isn't about money,
it's about my law license.

11:26.180 --> 11:28.842
When they locked me up,
I was disbarred.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.949
I've served my time,

11:29.990 --> 11:31.719
petitioned the state
to be reinstated,

11:31.750 --> 11:33.308
and passed the exam,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.510
but the DC Office of
Disciplinary Counsel

11:35.560 --> 11:38.028
is opposing my application
on the grounds

11:38.060 --> 11:41.552
that I don't possess the moral
character to practice law.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.192
You're a lavwer.
What the hell does
moral character

11:43.230 --> 11:44.697
have to do with anything?

11:44.730 --> 11:46.163
Tell me about it.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.567
But this guy...
Paul Wynn is his name...

11:49.600 --> 11:51.500
He's a real prick.

11:51.540 --> 11:54.008
And he's the one guy
who gets to decide

11:54.040 --> 11:57.077
ifI pass the ethics review
and get my license back.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.376
Marvin, I'd love to help you,
and I will, but this...

12:01.420 --> 12:03.217
I'm putting my foot down.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.808
You're holding me hostage.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.681
It's called a negotiation.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.359
You scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.759
Just talk to this guy.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.725
Try and move the needle.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.990
You want me to threaten
the DISCIplInary Counsel

12:17.030 --> 12:19.931
so he'll certify
your moral fortitude.

12:21.470 --> 12:22.767
Sounds about right.

Hold on,
he's been stabbed?
Stabbed when?

12:52.570 --> 12:54.629
Just now. I don't know...
We're just getting word.

12:54.670 --> 12:57.764
Any idea his condition?
You know as much as I do.

12:57.810 --> 13:00.608
Sir, CRT has commands.
What do you want to do
with the A and B blocks?

13:00.640 --> 13:03.370
Lock 'em down. If C's clear,
get the medics in now.

this is a federal

13:05.850 --> 13:07.340
We're gonna need
to assist you in questioning

13:07.380 --> 13:08.916
any of the inmates
or prison staff.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.441
Fantastic. You can have access
to anyone you want.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.082
I want the truth
as much as you do,

13:13.120 --> 13:14.951
but right now,
I got a prison to lock down.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.591
Hey!
Al.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.232
Good to see you.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.079
Dembe. How are things?

13:33.110 --> 13:35.431
Ah, better
for seeing you.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.471
How long has it been?
Must be close to a year.

13:37.510 --> 13:40.240
That dinner at Le Coucou.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.475
The red deer and chestnuts.
And the crepe suzette.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.283
REDDINGTON: The crepe suzette.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.982
And that fantastic,
crazy bassist

13:47.020 --> 13:49.454
from Dizzy's
with the shoes and the hair!

13:49.490 --> 13:50.957
Oh, my God, what a night!

13:50.990 --> 13:52.321
What a morning.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.952
Ah, honestly, Al,
our schedules

13:54.000 --> 13:55.422
couldn't be more out of sync.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.621
Imagine the trouble we'd find

13:57.670 --> 13:59.399
if you could
stay up past nine?

13:59.430 --> 14:02.035
You are the devil
on my shoulder, Ray.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.503
What... What's going on?

14:03.540 --> 14:05.303
I... I came as soon
as I got Dembe's text.

14:05.340 --> 14:07.103
I'm in
a bit of a sticlq wicket.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.778

No. (CHUCKLES)

14:08.810 --> 14:11.142
This time it's a friend.
A lawyer...

14:11.180 --> 14:14.115
Well, he was a lavwer.
You remember Marvin Gerard?

14:14.150 --> 14:15.242
How could I forget
Marvin Gerard?

14:16.350 --> 14:18.011
Oh, my gosh,
those Hawaiian shirts.

14:18.050 --> 14:20.257
And his voice...
They were louder the shirt.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.087
REDDINGTON: I know, I know.

14:23.190 --> 14:24.350
Ah, so is he okay?

14:29.700 --> 14:31.395
One hour or he dies.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.793
How do I know
he's not dead already?

14:34.840 --> 14:36.296
I'm looking
for information.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.001
He wouldn't give it to me.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.429
I'm betting that
to save his life, you will.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.471
Let me talk to him.

14:42.510 --> 14:45.070

if he's involved in this

what I want to know.

Understood.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.278
Please don't
let your Imam down.

RESSLER:
Arturo Ruel was murdered.

Do you know anything
about that?

15:10.440 --> 15:11.702
I don't know.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.037
Don't know or can't say?

Can't say
ifI know or not.

15:14.740 --> 15:17.573
_ Your cell
Is next to Ruel's.

Any idea how
his fingerprint

15:19.450 --> 15:21.714
ended up at a crime scene
over 20 miles away?

15:21.750 --> 15:23.115
You're asking
the wrong guy.

15:23.150 --> 15:26.881
When it comes to fingerprints,
I'm not expert.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.026
Imam Sadiq Asmal.
Ring any bells?

15:30.060 --> 15:31.084
I'm a Buddhist.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.223
Ruel ever mention anything
about Muslims to you?

15:33.260 --> 15:35.728
You're a hacker. Ba_nks.
Insurance companies.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.025
I am a security consultant
only in reverse.

15:39.070 --> 15:41.129
An insecurity consultant.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.104
And Ruel works in K&R.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.563
Only instead of getting
people back, he took them.

15:45.610 --> 15:48.033
Cool. Maybe I should check
his LinkedIn page.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.433
You're_both
known criminals.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.606

RESSLER:
Glorified leg-breaker.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.146
And yet
you're in isolation.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.249
What's your point?

15:55.280 --> 15:58.078
My point is people
with rap sheets like yours

15:58.120 --> 16:01.157
don't usually end up
in the isolation cell block.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.723
And yet here you are.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.950
Why is that?

16:05.990 --> 16:08.629
I'm just not a people person.

16:08.660 --> 16:11.993
It's weird, right,
_ the records of the
Inmates we spoke to.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.861
They didn't
merit isolation.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.731
Could be the warden
uses the isolated block

16:15.770 --> 16:17.135
to get them
to toe the line.

16:17.170 --> 16:19.138
I mean, it explains
why they wouldn't talk.

16:19.170 --> 16:20.535
Didn't wanna cause
any trouble.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.708
Hmm, could be.
But trouble for whom?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.103
Who are they protecting?

16:25.150 --> 16:26.447
Maybe Gerard knows.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.141
I mean, if that mouthpiece
knows anything,

16:28.180 --> 16:29.613
Reddington'll
get him to blow.

16:31.490 --> 16:35.654
Reddington wants to hand down
his empire to me.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.557
(CHUCKLES)
You seem surprised.

16:38.590 --> 16:39.727
What did you think,

16:39.760 --> 16:41.091
he was just
gonna give it to charity?

16:41.130 --> 16:42.597
I didn't think about it,

16:42.630 --> 16:44.598
and I'm not going
to accept it,

16:44.630 --> 16:47.997
but it's a little odd
that he would bring it up now.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.931
He found out I hired a PI
to shadow Ilya Koslov.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.677
So he knows that you know
that's not his real identity.

16:54.710 --> 16:57.372
Yeah, and instead of
confronting me about it,

16:57.410 --> 16:59.469
he decided to try

16:59.510 --> 17:00.841
and hand down
the keys to his kingdom,

17:00.880 --> 17:02.768
and there's got to be
a reason.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.040
What about mortality?

17:05.090 --> 17:07.388
His life is always
in mortal danger.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.827
But this is different.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.450
What do you know?

17:13.500 --> 17:16.458
You remember when
Reddington reconnected
with Spalding Stark?

17:16.500 --> 17:19.321
You haven't mentioned
my blood panel results.

17:19.370 --> 17:20.928
You've been too busy.
LIZ: Yeah.

17:20.970 --> 17:23.302
You said that was
for an Investment purpose.

17:23.340 --> 17:24.762
I told you what
he asked me to tell you.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.870
But the truth is,
when I was in Stark's lab,

17:27.910 --> 17:29.673
I saw Reddington's
medical file.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.471
What did it say?
I didn't read it.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.717
But it was the size
of a telephone book,

17:34.750 --> 17:37.480
and clearly he didn't want me
to see what was in it.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.817
I let it go,

17:38.850 --> 17:40.659
but if he's thinking
about his successor,

17:40.690 --> 17:42.578
my guess is that's why.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.192
(SIGHS) Paul can
be a prickly guy,

17:47.230 --> 17:48.697
but... But he's a good man.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.197
As is Marvin.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.528
Prickly, and a good man.

17:52.570 --> 17:53.798
Paul's smart as a whip.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.398
I haven't been with him
that long,

17:56.940 --> 17:58.202
Guy's a shark.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.208
You won't lose him.
Trust me.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.037
He doesn't wanna
lose you as a client.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.207
Oh, speak of the devil.
Excuse me.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.603
Paul.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.441
I should go, Raymond.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.584
Chuck and Morgan will cover
while I check on imam's wife.
She seemed worried.

18:13.620 --> 18:14.848
Of course,
take your time.

18:14.890 --> 18:16.710
Tell her we're doing
everything we can.

18:20.130 --> 18:24.829
Paul, I... I'd like you
to meet Ray and his
friend Marvin.

18:24.870 --> 18:25.928
PAUL: What the hell's this?

18:25.970 --> 18:27.232
REDDINGTON: A meeting
of the minds.

18:27.670 --> 18:28.739
Why is he here?

18:28.770 --> 18:30.635
You know Marvin,
you know why he's here.

18:30.670 --> 18:32.535
It's about his_ license
to practice.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.901
That's never
gonna happen.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.532
Think again,
you evergreen dip spit.

18:35.580 --> 18:36.706
The hell'd you
just call me?

18:36.740 --> 18:37.775
You heard me,
counselor.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.471
I swear to _God I'll have
your nuts In a Cheerio.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.944
Really?
Okay, all right,
everybody just calm down.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.448
Look, Paul,
like it or not,
Ray is a friend.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.741
A dear friend.

18:45.790 --> 18:48.213
And you get to decide
if his friend Marvin

18:48.260 --> 18:49.613
gets his law license back.

18:49.660 --> 18:51.548
Al, come on.
Not here.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.490
Okay, all right,
just hold on a minute.

18:53.530 --> 18:54.895
Let's sit down,
let's listen.

18:58.130 --> 19:01.668
Mr. Wynn, say what you will
about Marvin Gerard,

19:01.700 --> 19:04.464
and God knows
there's a lot to say.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.205
But the man has suffered

19:06.240 --> 19:08.299
a great deal
of hardship in his life,

19:08.340 --> 19:11.241
and through it all,
he has remained resolute

19:11.280 --> 19:15.444
in his advocacy for
and dedication to his clients.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.482
His principles
and sense of justice

19:17.520 --> 19:20.648
have always
remained intact.

19:20.690 --> 19:24.251
Now, his personality,
his demeanor,

19:24.290 --> 19:26.429
that's another
subject entirely.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.759
That being said, Paul,
you're the
Disciplinary Counsel.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.064
You run
the ethics committee.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.658
So let me pose
an ethical question...

19:33.700 --> 19:35.964
Is it so wrong
to reinstate a man

19:36.000 --> 19:39.128
with a questionable character
in exchange for, say,

19:39.170 --> 19:41.934
keeping a client
with an unquestionable one?

19:42.540 --> 19:43.643
You wouldn't leave me.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.341
Reinstate him or I'll walk

19:46.380 --> 19:48.940
and take my guaranteed
contract with me.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.015
You wouldn't.

19:50.050 --> 19:51.347
REDDINGTON:
(CHUCKLES) Oh, dear.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.187
Listen,
for what it's worth,

19:53.220 --> 19:56.109
I once lost a bundle to Al

19:56.160 --> 20:00.790
thinking he was bluffing
during a hand
of seven card stud.

20:00.830 --> 20:04.163
He has the sweetest,
most child-like face,

20:04.200 --> 20:07.636
but my guy A! is as serious
as a heart attack.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.729
But please,
don't take my word for it.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.408
_Talk it over
With your client.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.670
See what's happening
in his neck of the woods.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.007
I understand the committee

20:15.040 --> 20:17.133
is meeting this afternoon.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.171
**

20:30.330 --> 20:31.388
Get in.

20:40.230 --> 20:42.130
Harold, are you there?

20:42.170 --> 20:43.194
COOPER: We're here.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.334
Ha! So, I'm here
with an old friend

20:46.370 --> 20:48.907
who may have
some helpful intel

20:48.940 --> 20:52.171
about Arturo Ruel
and his mysterious
fingerprint.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.349
MARVIN:
More of a hunch, really.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.348
Is that Marvin Gerard?

20:56.380 --> 20:57.745
Aren't you supposed
to be in lockup?

20:57.790 --> 20:59.542
Hello, Agent Keen.

20:59.590 --> 21:00.818
Who's Marvin Gerard?

21:00.860 --> 21:02.851
MARVIN: Let me start by saying
I have no conventional proof,

21:02.890 --> 21:07.623
but I suspect
Ruel's fingerprint wasn't
lifted or moved,

21:07.660 --> 21:10.527
but ended up
in the office of Dembe's imam

21:10.570 --> 21:13.266
because Ruel
was there In person.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.632
How's that possible?
Someone let him
out of prison?

21:15.670 --> 21:17.160
I won't pretend to know
the details...

21:17.200 --> 21:19.259
I was in an entirely
different cell block.

21:19.310 --> 21:22.029
But people like to talk
in prison,

21:22.080 --> 21:24.344
and what they say is
that in this prison,

21:24.380 --> 21:28.077
there is a small,
but trusted group of inmates

21:28.120 --> 21:30.270
who get special favors.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.719
Well, that's true
for every prison.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.615
Yes, but in Wallens,

21:33.660 --> 21:37.926
the warden frequently puts his
favorite inmates in isolation

21:37.960 --> 21:41.293
just for looking
at someone the wrong way.
Why would he do that?

21:41.330 --> 21:44.822
Well, there's no better alibi
than being in isolation.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.929
It only requires
a small crew "on the take"

21:46.970 --> 21:48.733
to say you're there
when you're not.

21:48.770 --> 21:51.967
MARVIN: And the leader
on this crew
is Vincent Martin.

21:52.010 --> 21:55.070
Longtime prison guard and
warden Cain's right hand man.

21:55.110 --> 21:57.442
LIZ: You believe
they're putting Inmates
into isolation

21:57.480 --> 21:59.801
so they can let them out
to commit crimes?

21:59.850 --> 22:01.374
Well, what Marvin
is suggesting

22:01.420 --> 22:02.910
is that something fishy

22:02.950 --> 22:05.145
is going on at Wallens Ridge,

22:05.190 --> 22:06.543
_ so if we're
trying to understand

22:06.590 --> 22:09.150
how the DNA
of an incarcerated man

22:09.190 --> 22:11.556
ended up at a new crime scene
while he was in jail,

22:11.590 --> 22:14.127
we need _to start _
by looking at Vincent Martin.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.424
_ He's the one _
ultimately responSIble

22:16.460 --> 22:19.020
for the vanishing
of Imam Asmal.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.231
I'm telling you,
dollars to donuts,

22:21.270 --> 22:24.239
this guy is up to something,
and it's not good.

22:24.270 --> 22:26.158
Aram, pull what we have
on Martin.

22:26.210 --> 22:27.837
Keen, Park,
get eyes on him.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.279
Let's see
where he might take us.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.116
PARK: That's the guard?
Martin?

22:37.150 --> 22:38.742
LIZ: Yeah,
that's him all right.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.419
PARK: Where's he going?
His shift doesn't end
for four more hours.

22:51.470 --> 22:54.462

what we're gonna find out.

Call it in, see if Aram
can give us any details.

isn't in the system.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.755
It's an unknown.

23:47.790 --> 23:49.280

23:49.320 --> 23:50.548
The inmates...
Inmates? Wait...

23:50.590 --> 23:52.182
From Wallens.
They're on site

equipment to start a war.

24:03.870 --> 24:05.758
Sir, Marvin Gerard
was right.

24:05.810 --> 24:08.574
Evidently, Martin
smuggled several
inmates out of Wallens.

24:08.610 --> 24:10.202
They're heavily armed
and on the move.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.776

The indignities that

You found a way
