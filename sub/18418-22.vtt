00:00.330 --> 00:01.920
Previously on Nashville.

00:01.920 --> 00:03.670
Mom would have been so
proud of you, Dad.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.330
Look who's on the bill tonight.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.120
Hello, Brad.

00:07.120 --> 00:11.460
Our son. He's killing
his beautiful spirit.
Cruelty by cruelty.

00:11.460 --> 00:15.330
When I heard that song I felt
like it had to be mine.

00:15.330 --> 00:16.330
How could you?

00:18.250 --> 00:19.920
It's about Maddie's commercial.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.120
The client is asking to change
the lyrics to her song.

00:23.120 --> 00:26.040
-That's going too far.
-We're done with branding.

00:26.040 --> 00:32.420
You wiped out of this and
it's over. I'm done.

00:32.420 --> 00:35.290
- I heard the Opry was amazing.

00:35.290 --> 00:36.880
- Just shaking out the cobwebs.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.540
- Oh, shut up.
Stop being so modest.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.750
Well, I'm sorry I missed it.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.750
- Well, you're a busy man.

00:45.620 --> 00:49.380
- I hear your in-house
Zuckerberg is unhappy.

00:49.380 --> 00:50.790
Even thinking
about jumping ship.

00:50.790 --> 00:52.290
- Word travels fast.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.620
- Come on. Highway 65's
financial struggles

00:53.620 --> 00:55.290
over the years,

00:55.290 --> 00:56.500
they haven't exactly been
a big secret, you know.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.920
So if the label's in trouble,

00:57.920 --> 01:00.250
I'd like to help out.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.170
- I think you and
I have very different

01:03.170 --> 01:04.540
definitions of the word "help."

01:04.540 --> 01:08.210
- Just so you know,
off the record...

01:09.580 --> 01:10.790
I'd be interested.

01:10.790 --> 01:13.080
- In what?
- Buying Highway 65.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.330
- It's not for sale.

01:14.330 --> 01:17.460
- It will be
if "Zach-erberg" leaves.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.790
You'd run it the same way
you do every day.

01:19.790 --> 01:21.000
Just under the Shiny New Records
umbrella.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.540
You wouldn't even know I exist.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.040
- You forgive me if I have
trouble believing that.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.880
- Deacon, I've never
known you to be a patsy.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.420
Come on, here you are,

01:28.420 --> 01:30.920
at the helm of a sinking ship
just watching

01:30.920 --> 01:33.380
every label in town
just pick apart her dream

01:33.380 --> 01:34.960
like vultures on a carcass.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.460
- We done here?

01:39.040 --> 01:40.250
- I just want
what's best for you.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.670
- Why would you want that?

01:41.670 --> 01:43.540
(cell phone rings)

01:48.420 --> 01:50.080
- She was good, wasn't she?

01:53.330 --> 01:54.580
At the benefit.

01:58.380 --> 02:00.120
- Can't I just stay with you?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.460
- Oh, honey, you know
I wish you could.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.290
- Hey, Jakey.
Your dad's waiting for you.

02:07.290 --> 02:10.330
- Mom, I don't want to.
- I know.

02:11.380 --> 02:12.790
- Jessie?

02:12.790 --> 02:15.170
- Deacon?
Uh, what are you doing here?

02:15.170 --> 02:17.880
- Uh, just leaving.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.500
- This is my son, Jake.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.380
This is my good friend,
Deacon Claybourne.

02:22.380 --> 02:24.420
- Nice to meet you, Jake.

02:24.420 --> 02:26.580
- Give me a sec?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.080
- Mom, I just want
to stay with you.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.420
- I just want you
to stay with me too.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.040
But it's not
what the court says.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.330
And we just have
to listen, okay?

02:36.880 --> 02:39.420
I love you so much.

02:43.210 --> 02:44.960
All right, I'll see you later.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.080
(sighs)

02:53.080 --> 02:54.830
- I'm real sorry about that,
Jessie.

02:54.830 --> 02:56.210
That's just gotta be so hard.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.000
- It's not fun.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.120
- He seems like
a real sweet kid.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.080
- He is.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.040
I just wish things
were different.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.790
- I hear you.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.620
- Just four nights away
from the American Music Awards,

03:10.620 --> 03:13.420
and we are in no
shortage of drama.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.080
That Tennessee tussle that
included Juliette Barnes

03:15.080 --> 03:16.540
and Maddie Jaymes,

03:16.540 --> 03:18.500
both nominated
for favorite pop rock song.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.120
(cell phone rings)

03:24.540 --> 03:26.420
- Hello?

03:26.420 --> 03:29.170
- Hey.
How's it going?

03:29.170 --> 03:31.080
- I'm in the Ninth Circle
of Hell.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.580
- Betrayal.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.960
- What?

03:33.960 --> 03:36.040
- Dante's Inferno...
Ninth Circle.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.000
- That's an actual thing?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.250
- Yeah.
(chuckles)

03:39.250 --> 03:41.040
What are you talking about?

03:41.040 --> 03:43.670
- I am talking
about your daughter

03:43.670 --> 03:45.580
and me dying
of heat exhaustion,

03:45.580 --> 03:48.620
because of some
stupid condenser fan.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.330
- The AC broke?

03:50.330 --> 03:51.920
- Yep. They sent a guy.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.920
He's here now
doing who knows what?

03:55.920 --> 03:58.120
- How's everything else going?
- Horrible.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.920
Emily's not back till tomorrow.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.620
Cadence is miserable.
Maddie still won't talk to me.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.920
And I'm supposed to be
finishing an album

04:03.920 --> 04:05.710
with a label that may
or may not exist!

04:05.710 --> 04:09.380
Oh, not to mention we have a
pre-awards show party tonight.

04:09.380 --> 04:12.120
And it's all too much.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.830
- Uh, listen, hon,
my phone's about to die,

04:13.830 --> 04:15.330
and we're trying to get
into Albuquerque

04:15.330 --> 04:16.830
before the storm hits, so...

04:16.830 --> 04:18.830
- Please, go!

04:18.830 --> 04:21.420
- I'm sorry.
You sure you're okay?

04:21.420 --> 04:23.120
- Peachy!

04:23.120 --> 04:25.750
(telephone ringing)

04:37.790 --> 04:39.960
- The phone just died.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.380
- What's going on?

04:45.380 --> 04:46.580
- Deacon, you need
to get over here.

04:46.580 --> 04:47.580
The power's out.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.620
- What?
- Yeah.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.080
Lights, phones, everything.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.580
I called the electric company.

04:52.580 --> 04:55.500
Our account has been cancelled.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.670
- By who?

04:56.670 --> 04:59.250
- Zach Welles.

05:01.540 --> 05:03.460
- Stay there.
I'm on my way.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.460
- It takes three days
to resume service?

05:15.460 --> 05:17.580
- That's not all.
- What?

05:17.580 --> 05:19.620
- In order to start an account,
they need a deposit.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.750
- So?

05:20.750 --> 05:21.750
- Our bank account.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.120
It's empty.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.830
Zach cleaned it out.

05:25.830 --> 05:27.460
- Son of a...

05:31.210 --> 05:32.500
- Deacon...

05:32.500 --> 05:33.790
with Juliette's studio time,

05:33.790 --> 05:35.460
the promotional campaign
for the girls.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.460
We're about to be overdrawn.

05:36.460 --> 05:37.460
- Hey, it's Zach.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.460
No one leaves these anymore.

05:38.460 --> 05:39.710
But if you must...

05:42.920 --> 05:45.330
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

05:45.330 --> 05:46.710
What do we do?

05:46.710 --> 05:48.250
- I'll tell you
what we don't do.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.540
We don't have our people
standing around here

05:49.540 --> 05:51.250
in the dark, all right?

05:51.250 --> 05:52.500
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna just...

05:54.500 --> 05:56.330
move it all to my house,
the whole operation.

05:56.330 --> 05:57.380
- No, no, no.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.880
You need a place to go home to.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.420
- Then what, Lori?

06:02.580 --> 06:04.750
- You know what?
I might have an idea.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.830
Let me make a phone call.

06:14.580 --> 06:16.420
- Which one?
- Right.

06:16.420 --> 06:17.960
- Maddie, you didn't even look.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.790
- Okay, the left.
Why are you freaking out?

06:20.790 --> 06:23.290
- (sighs) This is THE
end of the summer party.

06:23.290 --> 06:24.960
Half the school's
gonna be there.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.710
- And Flynn?

06:26.710 --> 06:29.000
- Yes. Flynn will be
in attendance.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.830
God, this is so stressful!

06:30.830 --> 06:33.210
- Do not even talk to me
about stressful, Daphne.

06:33.210 --> 06:34.830
(cell phone rings)

06:34.830 --> 06:36.080
Hey, Dad, what's up?

06:37.880 --> 06:39.920
What?

06:39.920 --> 06:41.750
Okay, yeah, yeah,
we'll be right over.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.290
- What's going on?

06:43.290 --> 06:46.080
- I guess something's
happening at Highway 65.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.290
He's like calling the entire
office into Tracks.

06:53.790 --> 06:56.210
- Can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, Gary.

06:56.210 --> 06:57.880
- Man, whatever you need, Deac.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.040
I'm just sorry
this is all happening, man.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.250
But she's all yours.
- Thank you, brother.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.540
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.210
- What's going on?

07:06.210 --> 07:08.540
- Well, Zach's just flexing
his muscles, sweetheart.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.750
- Oh my God, I can't believe
everyone had to come here.

07:10.750 --> 07:14.580
- This is not because of you.
You know that, baby.

07:14.580 --> 07:16.830
- Deacon?
- Anything?

07:16.830 --> 07:18.460
- I'm so sorry.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.210
He's not returning my calls,
my texts.

07:20.210 --> 07:21.750
I had no idea about
any of this, I swear.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.460
- I know that.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.040
- Gunnar's still out looking
at a few places, but...

07:25.040 --> 07:27.420
I just wanted to be
here with y'all.

07:27.420 --> 07:28.620
- Appreciate it.
(cell phone dings)

07:28.620 --> 07:30.170
- Gunnar's back?

07:30.170 --> 07:31.620
- Yeah. He got in last night.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.120
- Excuse me, everybody.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.830
I just got a text from Juliette.
I thought she was on her way.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.540
Apparently, she is not
at this point.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.290
I'm not sure exactly
when she's gonna be here.

07:48.290 --> 07:50.750
If you guys could just short of
hang out for a little while,

07:50.750 --> 07:52.420
I sure would appreciate it.

07:52.420 --> 07:53.920
- Sure.
- Thank you very much.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.500
- Look who I found
wandering the halls.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.000
- Kacey, what are you
doing here?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.420
- I'm cutting some new songs,

07:58.420 --> 08:00.000
and I heard about what happened.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.580
It's ridiculous.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.210
- It's crazy.
- I'm gonna start a protest.

08:03.210 --> 08:04.420
- You are? Okay, do it.
- Yeah, yes.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.120
Hey, girls, how are you?

08:06.120 --> 08:08.250
- How's it going?
- Good to see you.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.710
- More good news.
- What's up?

08:09.710 --> 08:10.960
- Our credit card
has been declined.

08:59.210 --> 09:01.670
All right. Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.920
- Burgers and milkshakes,
anybody?

09:03.920 --> 09:06.040
- Aw, lookee here.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.460
- Hey, here you go.
- Thank you so much.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.460
- Hey, girls, will you
pass those out?

09:10.460 --> 09:12.710
- Scarlett called and said
you guys could use some help.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.460
- Thank you.
- Of course.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.880
Chocolate?
- Thank you.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.670
- No problem.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.670
- What do you think Dad will do
if we have to shut down?

09:25.670 --> 09:28.040
- I think he'll do
what he did before.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.120
- Before he made music with Mom?

09:30.120 --> 09:34.170
- He'll still make music,
just not with Mom.

09:34.170 --> 09:37.710
- Do you think he'll make music
with somebody else?

09:37.710 --> 09:40.670
- I guess, yeah, eventually.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.460
- What do you think of Jessie?

09:44.460 --> 09:46.960
- I don't know yet.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.250
- I'll be back in a little
while, girls.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.710
Gunnar found Zach.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.420
Zach, what is this?
What are you doing?

10:05.420 --> 10:07.960
- You told me to do what I will.
So I'm doing what I will.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.290
- By cutting the power?
Turning off our damn cable?

10:10.290 --> 10:12.830
- Now I tried to be civil.
I tried to be nice.

10:12.830 --> 10:16.830
I've spent my whole life
trying to be nice.

10:16.830 --> 10:20.500
But when I am pushed too far,
that ends.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.120
Now listen to me.

10:22.120 --> 10:26.750
I don't lose ever.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.080
So now you are gonna watch

10:29.080 --> 10:31.210
as I hold this label
down by the throat

10:31.210 --> 10:33.420
until every single one
of you comes to me

10:33.420 --> 10:36.040
begging for air.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.790
You chose to have this fight!

10:40.830 --> 10:44.290
- I never realized
how small you are.

10:46.380 --> 10:47.960
- It's funny.
You confronting me

10:47.960 --> 10:50.920
about a business
that you view as a chore.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.670
I'm curious.
What made you start caring?

10:53.670 --> 10:56.750
Please tell me
it wasn't the mascara.

11:00.500 --> 11:04.620
("Gold Angel" by Minke playing)
♪ I'll be your gold angel ♪

11:04.620 --> 11:07.120
♪ If you want me ♪

11:11.710 --> 11:14.540
- How you feeling?
- Not great.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.170
- Whoa.
Look at me.

11:17.170 --> 11:19.710
Honey, you deserve to be here.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.000
- It does not feel like it.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.250
- Come on, you are
Juliette Barnes,

11:23.250 --> 11:24.750
comeback artist of the decade.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.290
So you borrowed a song.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.830
But you made it a hit.
You made it great.

11:29.830 --> 11:33.420
You are here because of you,
no one else.

11:33.420 --> 11:35.540
Now let's walk over there,
congratulate Maddie,

11:35.540 --> 11:37.960
and enjoy this party.

11:47.330 --> 11:49.120
- I'll be back.

11:54.170 --> 11:56.080
- No, Dad, no!
- What?

11:56.080 --> 11:58.330
- You can't!
- Daphne, whatever this is,

11:58.330 --> 11:59.750
honey, I got to get
to the bottom of it.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.330
- She doesn't want
to talk about it.

12:01.330 --> 12:03.500
- What's going on?

12:03.500 --> 12:04.540
- She'll kill me.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.000
- Daphne, please!

12:06.000 --> 12:07.380
That is enough, honey!
Just tell me!

12:07.380 --> 12:10.250
What is happening here?

12:10.250 --> 12:12.250
- Juliette stole Maddie's song.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.920
("Waterfall" playing)
♪ When it's swim or sink ♪

12:16.120 --> 12:19.170
- What song?

12:19.170 --> 12:22.380

but gut instinct ♪

12:22.380 --> 12:24.120
What do you mean, stole?

12:24.120 --> 12:26.670
- Travis Stroud gave it to
Juliette to give it to Maddie.

12:26.670 --> 12:30.540
And she never did.
She recorded it for herself.

12:36.460 --> 12:37.790
- Why didn't she tell me?

12:37.790 --> 12:43.040
- She knew you'd be mad.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.080
- She's right.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.380
You ain't gonna outrun me!

12:50.170 --> 12:51.920
Not in those heels.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.580
- I don't know why
she didn't tell you sooner.

12:57.830 --> 12:59.040
- How could you?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.710
- I don't think I could ever

13:00.710 --> 13:03.330
try to explain it to you.

13:03.330 --> 13:04.960
I can't even
explain it to myself.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.080
- How far do we go back,
you and me, huh?

13:08.080 --> 13:10.290
That's my daughter, Juliette,
who just happens to love you.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.170
And you do this?

13:13.170 --> 13:14.500
We're supposed to be family!

13:14.500 --> 13:16.330
- It was a horrible mistake!

13:16.330 --> 13:20.960
I tried to apologize, but I know
that doesn't mean anything!

13:20.960 --> 13:24.540
How can I make this right?

13:24.540 --> 13:26.580
- You can't.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.380
Listen to me.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.080
I'm gonna keep battling
for Highway 65.

13:31.080 --> 13:35.000
But not for you.
For everybody else.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
When the dust settles,
if there's still a label,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.790
you are off of it.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.830
- So what do you want?

13:51.830 --> 13:52.880
- Who's she?

13:52.880 --> 13:55.210
- Hi. I'm Alyssa Greene,

13:55.210 --> 13:57.880
chief strategy officer
for Highway 65.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.620
- That sounds important.

13:59.620 --> 14:02.290
I heard you turned the lights
out on your employees.

14:02.290 --> 14:04.040
I mean, that's some strategy.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.710
Deacon Claybourne
has set up shop at Tracks.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.460
He's running his little label

14:07.460 --> 14:09.250
despite it being handcuffed
by his out-of-town investor.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.830
I mean, it's inspiring, really.

14:11.830 --> 14:13.380
- Aren't you the soft touch.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.880
- You have managed to create
even more sympathy

14:15.880 --> 14:17.830
for the Queen of Country's
widower,

14:17.830 --> 14:18.920
which I didn't think
was even possible.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.620
So, well done.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.120
- You know, whenever I think
of investing in a company,

14:23.120 --> 14:26.380
I dive deep
and learn things.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.620
About the company,
about the competition.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.000
I obsess over it, actually.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.080
My therapist says
it's unhealthy.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.880
- What'd you find out about me?

14:35.540 --> 14:39.000
- That you are an impulsive,
egotistical narcissist

14:39.000 --> 14:40.460
who masquerades as a nice guy.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.000
- What does that make you,
you little twit?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.920
- But you're not stupid.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.620
So what do you want, Brad?

14:46.620 --> 14:49.380
- I want the end of Highway 65
to benefit both of us.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.830
- What makes you so sure I still
want to be in this business?

14:51.830 --> 14:53.000
- Because you're sitting
in that chair right there

14:53.000 --> 14:55.750
having a meeting with me.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.120
- What are you proposing?

14:58.120 --> 15:00.620
- A multiplatform media company.

15:00.620 --> 15:03.120
Why should we get only
half the tour money?

15:03.120 --> 15:05.710
Why not own the tour?
Own the content?

15:05.710 --> 15:09.080
Own every exploitation
of every artist brand?

15:09.080 --> 15:11.620
Why not own a network?

15:11.620 --> 15:14.540
Think we can't do
better than CMT?

- I miss playing with you.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.620
- Hey, guys.

15:51.620 --> 15:52.920
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, bud.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.960
How you doing?
- Good, good.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.460
- Hey, I heard you
got in last night.

15:58.460 --> 16:00.960
- Yeah.
Sorry I didn't call.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.500
You wanna go for a walk?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.540
- How was Texas?

16:05.540 --> 16:07.120
- My grandma is still
a wicked old bird.

16:07.120 --> 16:11.000
- Yeah...

16:11.000 --> 16:13.750
The Bluebird asked us to play
their 35th anniversary show.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.000
- Is that something
you're gonna do?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.710
- Well, they asked us.

16:18.710 --> 16:21.210
- Didn't know there was
an "us" anymore.

16:21.210 --> 16:22.790
- I don't think either of us

16:22.790 --> 16:24.290
really have the answer
to that right now.

16:24.290 --> 16:27.960
- Well, listen,
I'm ready to talk.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.250
I mean, really talk this time.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.080
Not just...you listen to me

16:33.080 --> 16:35.210
try to convince us both
that I'm good enough.

16:35.210 --> 16:37.960
Because I can't do that anymore.

16:37.960 --> 16:42.250
You said that I needed you
to make me happy.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.830
And maybe that used to be true,

16:44.830 --> 16:48.540
but it's not anymore.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.710
I don't need you to carry me
in this relationship.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.830
- Okay. Let's talk.

16:56.830 --> 16:58.210
- I can't believe
Maddie got nominated

16:58.210 --> 17:00.330
for an American Music Award.

17:00.330 --> 17:02.170
I wish I had your family.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.120
The only thing my sister
gets nominated for

17:04.120 --> 17:05.790
is bitch of the century.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.880
- I'm so not going swimming.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.790
- Me either.
How do I look?

17:10.790 --> 17:12.830
- Like you're 25.
- Perfect.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.580
Now you.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.170
Come on, it's strawberry
flavored.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.380
Flynn will love it.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.290
- Louisa,
nothing is gonna happen.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.670
Jake Maitland is here.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.540
- Whoa, now there's a nut job.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.960
How did he get invited?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.920
I get such a totes
creep vibe from him.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.460
(cell phone buzzes)

17:37.920 --> 17:39.120
- Hey.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.290
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

17:41.290 --> 17:43.670
- I can hear it
in your voice.

17:43.670 --> 17:45.540
- All I said was, "Hey."

17:45.540 --> 17:48.540
- Babe, just tell me.

17:48.540 --> 17:50.330
- I just wish you were home.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.380
- I know.
I wish I was home too.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.290
Did you hear about Zach?

17:57.290 --> 17:59.330
- God, what now?

17:59.330 --> 18:01.540
- Well, apparently, he's in
talks with Brad Maitland.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.330
Something about a new company.

18:03.330 --> 18:07.380
If it's true, it really is
the end of Highway 65.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.790
Juliette?

18:12.790 --> 18:13.830
- Yeah, I'm here.

18:13.830 --> 18:16.330
- Are you okay?

18:16.330 --> 18:19.380
- Yeah. I just...

18:19.380 --> 18:20.920
can't believe that could be it.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.960
- You talked to Deacon?

18:22.960 --> 18:24.830
I think it's important that
he knows we're here for him.

18:24.830 --> 18:27.380
I can't imagine what
he's going through right now.

18:27.380 --> 18:31.080
Trying to keep
Rayna's dream alive.

18:31.080 --> 18:34.290
- There's got to be something...
something we can do.

18:34.290 --> 18:36.750
- I don't think there's anything
to do at this point.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.120
I mean, Zach and Brad
deserve each other.

18:38.120 --> 18:42.380
Two vain, ego-driven jerks.

18:43.670 --> 18:44.750
- What?

18:44.750 --> 18:48.620
- Are you sure you're okay?

18:48.620 --> 18:52.000
- Yeah, really.
I'm--I'm fine.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.290
Look, I love you so much.

18:54.290 --> 18:55.460
Let's talk later.

18:55.460 --> 18:58.710
- Okay.
I love you too. Bye.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.710
- For your troubles?

19:18.710 --> 19:21.380
- Not really in the mood.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.170
- Must be bad.

19:23.170 --> 19:26.210
- What must be bad?

19:26.210 --> 19:27.920
- Nothing at all.

19:27.920 --> 19:31.790
- I'm not gonna keep
defending my relationship.

19:31.790 --> 19:33.290
- And I'm not asking you to.

19:33.290 --> 19:34.790
- Juliette makes me happy.

19:34.790 --> 19:37.830
- (chuckles) Yeah...
You seem happy.

19:37.830 --> 19:40.540
- Why do you care
so much anyway?

19:40.540 --> 19:43.080
- Because I've been in this
business long enough

19:43.080 --> 19:44.710
to know the path of destruction

19:44.710 --> 19:46.420
the Juliettes of this world
leave in their wake.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.460
Makes me wonder why smart people
want to be a part of that.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.380
- It's not really any
of your business, is it?

19:54.380 --> 19:55.620
- It isn't.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.380
- Look, there's Flynn.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.290
- Why is he talking to Rebecca?

20:04.290 --> 20:07.880
- I knew you should have kissed
him when you had the chance.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.580
- So Ashley told me that
she saw him talking right now.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.080
I just couldn't believe it.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.380
So I told Chad
we should break up.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.080
He's just totally
lame and uncool.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.460
- Really?
Hey, have you seen Daphne?

20:18.460 --> 20:20.290
- No.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.000
Do you want to see who can hold
their breath the longest?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.290
- What?

20:27.920 --> 20:30.170
- Daph, relax.
They're just friends.

20:30.170 --> 20:32.420
- I'll go first, and then you.
Count.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.210
- Eighth grade
is really gonna suck!

20:46.210 --> 20:47.670
- What?

20:47.670 --> 20:49.710
- I mean, if it's anything
like this party.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.920
It's filled with stupid people.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.540
Present company excluded.

20:54.540 --> 20:56.040
- How do you know
I'm not stupid?

20:56.040 --> 20:59.460
- I don't.
I was just being polite.

20:59.460 --> 21:02.380
This is already the most I've
talked to anyone all day.

21:03.880 --> 21:04.880
- Being out here
while everyone's back there

21:04.880 --> 21:06.290
doesn't help.

21:06.290 --> 21:09.250
- I'm avoiding my fears.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.120
I find it much easier
than facing them.

21:11.120 --> 21:14.210
- Well, that's one way
of handling things.

21:14.210 --> 21:16.750
- My dad calls it weak.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.960
- That's mean.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.080
- I don't know.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.170
Sometimes I think he's right.

21:25.170 --> 21:26.670
I'm Jake, by the way.

21:26.670 --> 21:30.250
- Yeah, I know who you are.
I'm Daphne.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.500
- I know who you are too.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.000
- I think I've been running
from that feeling my whole life.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.250
I'd die if I was
ever alone again.

21:41.250 --> 21:45.080
Even in high school,
I couldn't be alone.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.080
Ran into this girl back home.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.080
She said I was constantly in
relationships even back then.

21:50.080 --> 21:54.250
It's a real problem.
But I'm willing to work on it.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.330
- You spend time
with this person?

21:56.330 --> 22:00.080
- Yeah, she helped me
figure out a few...

22:00.080 --> 22:02.080
What?

22:02.080 --> 22:06.330
- I hope one day for your sake

22:06.330 --> 22:09.080
you can figure out how to
search your soul on your own.

22:13.830 --> 22:16.620
- Um, why couldn't
my dad pick me up?

22:16.620 --> 22:20.040
- There was a lawyer coming over
to go through stuff with him.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.880
And I thought I'd help him out.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.920
Did you guys have fun?

22:25.920 --> 22:28.670
Jakey, how was
the party for you?

22:28.670 --> 22:30.750
- Fine.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.250
- Did you make any new friends?

22:32.250 --> 22:34.710
- Mom.
- I'm just asking.

22:34.710 --> 22:37.540
- Can we talk about my social
anxiety some other time?

22:37.540 --> 22:39.290
- Excuse me, yes.
I'm sorry.

22:39.290 --> 22:40.880
We'll talk about it
another time.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.170
- So what am I supposed to do?

22:43.170 --> 22:44.460
I'm over at Highway 65

22:44.460 --> 22:46.670
trying to smile
and support my friends.

22:46.670 --> 22:48.750
Meanwhile, I don't know
what's going on.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.120
I don't even know where you are.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.540
- Well, I didn't ask
for any of this.

22:51.540 --> 22:53.710
I did everything I
could to avoid it, Will.

22:53.710 --> 22:56.710
- You're being a real ass
to people that I love.

22:56.710 --> 23:00.330
So whatever your reasons are,
Zach, I can't do it.

23:00.330 --> 23:01.960
- I'm looking out
for your future.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.420
- Doesn't feel like it.
- Do you really think

23:04.420 --> 23:06.000
I'd let anything bad happen
to you as a result of this?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.120
- I don't think you're
hearing me, Zach.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.880
These are my friends.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.000
- Yeah, and where were you
a year ago with your friends?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.750
You were waging war
with Cynthia Davis,

23:12.750 --> 23:14.250
begging for radio play.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.000
Will, I made you
the face of Budweiser.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.790
People accept you now
for who you are.

23:20.790 --> 23:23.540
- The people I care about
have always accepted me, Zach.

23:26.580 --> 23:28.040
And they need me now.

23:31.420 --> 23:34.380
- Listen,
I'll call you later, okay?

23:34.380 --> 23:37.120
- Don't...

23:39.620 --> 23:40.880
- Don't call me later.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.710
- Hey, beautiful girl,
- Good to see you.

23:50.710 --> 23:53.380
- You too, and congratulations
on the nomination.

23:53.380 --> 23:55.920
I'm so proud.
- Thank you very much.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.670
- Thanks for coming out,
everybody!

23:57.670 --> 23:59.380
Amy, come on up here.

24:02.420 --> 24:06.080
Ya'll, Amy opened
The Bluebird Café in 1982

24:06.080 --> 24:08.500
as a place where people
could come and witness

24:08.500 --> 24:10.210
the process of making music.

24:10.210 --> 24:13.000
Tonight we're here
to celebrate the musicians,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.330
fans, and the stories
that made it all happen.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.920
- I don't normally do this.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.380
- What's that?
Smoke cigarettes or ruin lives?

24:24.380 --> 24:25.790
- That's very funny.

24:25.790 --> 24:29.750
- Actually not.
Where's your boss?

24:29.750 --> 24:32.040
- Not here.
- Convenient.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.540
- You know, it doesn't
have to be over, Deacon.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.920
You can still make
peace with Zach.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.790
- By caving in
to all his demands?

24:37.790 --> 24:41.290
- No.
By living in the real world.

24:41.290 --> 24:43.580
You know, sometimes people have
to do things they don't like.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.620
- For you, I guess that means
following Zach around

24:45.620 --> 24:47.750
like a lost puppy to every
sleazy label in town, huh?

24:47.750 --> 24:49.670
- No.
You know what?

24:49.670 --> 24:51.920
I am looking out for my future.
You should be doing the same.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.330
- I'm looking out for the people
I care about, Alyssa.

24:54.330 --> 24:55.420
- You know the difference
between you and me?

24:55.420 --> 24:56.830
- What's that?

24:56.830 --> 24:58.460
- I don't live in
some fantasy world

24:58.460 --> 25:00.250
where I think artistic
integrity comes without a price.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.000
- Okay, well, maybe you should
head back to computer valley

25:02.000 --> 25:03.620
where you don't have to worry
about those things.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.540
- Why are you so impossible?

25:05.540 --> 25:07.790
- Because I believe in
something, maybe? Is that why?

25:07.790 --> 25:10.880
- No, because you don't
know what's good for you!

25:10.880 --> 25:12.710
- What's good for me, Alyssa?
Please enlighten me.

25:12.710 --> 25:14.120
What is good for me?

25:17.330 --> 25:21.710
What?
What's so funny, Alyssa?

25:21.710 --> 25:24.880
- I can't even say it.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.460
- I don't know what's
going on here right now.

25:27.460 --> 25:31.330
W-what are you doing...

25:31.330 --> 25:32.460
What the hell was that?

25:32.460 --> 25:34.880
What are you doing?

25:34.880 --> 25:37.120
- You looked like you needed it.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.710
I look at you
and I see this poor guy

25:39.710 --> 25:42.080
who's been to hell
and back, you know.

25:42.080 --> 25:46.210
With the label and Rayna
and just everything.

25:46.210 --> 25:49.120
It's just my way.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.540
- Your way of what?

25:51.540 --> 25:54.710
- I tend to see the pain
in people when I shouldn't.

25:54.710 --> 25:58.330
That's how I am.
It's exhausting really.

26:01.290 --> 26:02.540
- Good luck with Zach.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.170
- Hey, thanks.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.330
- I do have problems.
I have a million.

26:13.330 --> 26:15.210
And I'm committed
to fixing them.

26:15.210 --> 26:16.750
- Okay.

26:16.750 --> 26:19.290
- Look, I understand
you'll never trust me.

26:19.290 --> 26:20.790
- Oh, Gunnar, stop this.

26:20.790 --> 26:23.330
- But have you ever truly
trusted anybody?

26:23.330 --> 26:26.290
- Okay, I'm not doing
this now, not here.

26:26.290 --> 26:29.620
- Me? Caleb?
Even Avery?

26:29.620 --> 26:32.540
Who's been good enough?

26:32.540 --> 26:34.920
Scarlett, you never completely
let anybody in your life.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.920
You find faults

26:36.920 --> 26:39.120
and you pick apart
all the people who love you.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.920
And that's...
that's on you.

26:44.210 --> 26:46.710
It's time you realized not
everything is my fault.

26:46.710 --> 26:53.830
Because...I'm done trying.

26:53.830 --> 26:57.250
I'm done trying with you,
Scarlett.

26:57.250 --> 27:00.290
(applause from other room)

27:00.290 --> 27:02.750
- And now please help me
welcome a couple

27:02.750 --> 27:05.170
that not only began
making music,

27:05.170 --> 27:07.500
but also actually
met in this room.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.960
Scarlett O'Connor
and Gunnar Scott.

27:13.330 --> 27:15.080
- Thank you.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.880
We're gonna play a song called
"As the Crow Flies".

29:29.170 --> 29:30.170
- Hello?

29:30.170 --> 29:31.250
- Hi.
Zach Welles?

29:31.250 --> 29:32.880
- Speaking.
Who is this?

29:32.880 --> 29:36.670
- This is Mackenzie Rhodes
from 33 1/3 Magazine.

29:36.670 --> 29:38.420
- How did you get this number?

29:38.420 --> 29:40.920
- I just want to do a quick
fact check on some quotes

29:40.920 --> 29:42.880
about your leap
into the music industry.

29:42.880 --> 29:43.880
- Quotes for what?

29:43.880 --> 29:45.830
- A story. I just told you.

29:45.830 --> 29:48.880
- Yeah.
A story about what?

29:48.880 --> 29:50.460
- A story about
a billionaire fan boy

29:50.460 --> 29:52.670
that destroyed the legacy
of Rayna Jaymes.

29:52.670 --> 29:53.710
- Is this a joke?

29:53.710 --> 29:55.330
- Is it true that you're,

29:55.330 --> 29:58.290
"withholding company funds,
cancelling ad campaigns.

29:58.290 --> 30:01.250
And shutting off the power
on your own employees"?

30:01.250 --> 30:03.080
- Okay, who's your source?

30:03.080 --> 30:04.710
- I can't release my sources.
But I can quote them.

30:04.710 --> 30:07.420
"He's an ineffective
and temperamental leader.

30:07.420 --> 30:09.250
"Working for Mr. Wells

30:09.250 --> 30:11.750
"is like working
for a spoiled six-year-old.

30:11.750 --> 30:15.880
He's an outsider we wished
would have just stayed out."

30:15.880 --> 30:17.210
- You are not printing this.

30:17.210 --> 30:18.210
- You don't want to hear more?

30:18.210 --> 30:19.710
- You listen to me, Mackenzie.

30:19.710 --> 30:20.710
When my lawyers
are done with you,

30:20.710 --> 30:22.170
you will never work again.

30:22.170 --> 30:23.460
- Is that on the record?

30:28.620 --> 30:31.460
- Okay, that is the weirdest
thing I've ever had to do.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.290
- I tend to bring
that out in people.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.250
- You gave me
all this information.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.330
I can't print it.

30:36.330 --> 30:38.000
- Don't worry,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
you will be very happy
with the story you can print.

30:43.710 --> 30:45.830
- We can expect the major
portion of the storms

30:45.830 --> 30:48.460
to hit Albuquerque overnight...

30:48.460 --> 30:50.460
(knock on door)

30:53.620 --> 30:57.420
- Storm provisions,
or apology sandwiches.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.960
Whichever you prefer.
- Thanks.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.080
- Can I come in?

31:02.080 --> 31:03.920
- Uh, sure.

31:05.540 --> 31:07.500
- I'm really sorry.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
You're entitled to
whatever life you choose.

31:09.500 --> 31:13.210
And I have no right to project
my beliefs onto you.

31:13.210 --> 31:14.540
- I appreciate that.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.000
- Sometimes I don't know
when to shut up.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.880
- Kind of like
someone else I know.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.960
- This is bombshell news
coming out of Music City.

31:21.960 --> 31:25.250
Juliette Barnes has
withdrawn herself

31:25.250 --> 31:26.920
from her American Music Award
nomination.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.920
According to Mackenzie Rhodes
with 33 1/2 Magazine,

31:29.920 --> 31:32.500
Juliette Barnes admitted
to recording a song

31:32.500 --> 31:34.500
meant for friend and
fellow nominee, Maddie Jaymes.

31:34.500 --> 31:38.040
The very song nominated
in the same category.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.710
And this after
an explosive night

31:39.710 --> 31:44.040
at a release party
a few weeks back.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.670
- Did you know
that she did that?

31:46.670 --> 31:49.040
- No.
- Oh, my God.

31:50.830 --> 31:51.880
Where are you going?

31:51.880 --> 31:55.500
- Home.
- Are you serious?

31:55.500 --> 31:57.500
To clean up her mess again?

31:57.500 --> 31:58.710
- I thought you came here
to apologize.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.830
- Forget about me, Avery.

32:00.830 --> 32:02.460
Is this really what you want
for the rest of your life?

32:02.460 --> 32:04.250
- I need you to book me
a flight back to Nashville.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.880
- Have you looked outside?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.620
No one's flying anywhere.
Everything is canceled.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.210
- Get me a rental car.
- It's gonna take you forever

32:09.210 --> 32:10.670
to drive to Nashville.

32:10.670 --> 32:12.710
- I don't care.
I have to get home.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.250
- Building a fort?

32:17.250 --> 32:19.250
- (chuckles) No.
I just lost my phone.

32:19.250 --> 32:21.250
I can't find it anywhere.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.670
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

32:23.670 --> 32:24.960
Remember the last time
that you saw it?

32:24.960 --> 32:26.710
- No.

32:26.710 --> 32:28.540
I just hope I didn't leave it
at that stupid party.

32:28.540 --> 32:30.420
- The party was stupid?

32:30.420 --> 32:33.040
- No, it just...

32:33.040 --> 32:35.330
reminded me of how complicated
eighth grade's gonna be.

32:35.330 --> 32:40.790
- Yeah, well, truth is,

32:40.790 --> 32:43.670
life's just complicated
in general, you know?

32:45.620 --> 32:47.880
But we roll with it.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.880
The joy and the pain.

32:49.880 --> 32:52.290
- Why did Jessie
pick me up from the party?

32:52.290 --> 32:54.920
- I had to meet with a lawyer.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.420
It wasn't anything really.

32:56.420 --> 33:00.290
She was just, you know,
doing me a favor.

33:00.290 --> 33:03.540
- Is she gonna be like around?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.710
- Sweetheart, I got you,
and I've got your sister.

33:09.710 --> 33:12.540
That's all I need.

33:22.880 --> 33:25.620
- Oh, there it is.
Thank you.

33:25.620 --> 33:28.250
I told you I'd come get it.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.620
- It was no trouble.
It was on my way.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.380
- Tell you what,
Daphne about lost her mind

33:31.380 --> 33:32.830
when she realized
she forgot this.

33:32.830 --> 33:35.120
- I believe it.
Kids and their phones, right?

33:35.120 --> 33:36.380
- Yeah.
Like we're any better.

33:36.380 --> 33:37.500
- That's true.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.040
So what's next?

33:39.040 --> 33:40.580
- Los Angeles.

33:40.580 --> 33:43.080
- Right. Gosh. Wow.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.620
Well, wish Maddie luck for me.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.330
- I'll do it.
I'll tell her.

33:47.330 --> 33:48.670
- All right.

34:11.380 --> 34:15.830
You take good care
of yourself, Deacon.

34:15.830 --> 34:17.500
- You too, Jess.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.580
- I could sue you, you know.

34:41.620 --> 34:43.000
- On what grounds?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.620
- No one has ever
treated me this way.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.420
- Yeah, the feeling's mutual.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.620
- The things you said--what you
want to put out in the press!

34:48.620 --> 34:50.080
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.540
- Now don't lie to me!
- I'm not lying!

34:51.540 --> 34:54.120
- Now I might be
an ineffectual leader, Deacon.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.000
But I am not an idiot!

34:56.000 --> 34:58.540
You think you can run
this company without me!

34:58.540 --> 35:00.620
You think you have
the ability to run anything!

35:00.620 --> 35:01.830
And what is it
you call yourself?

35:01.830 --> 35:03.670
You call yourself
a side man.

35:03.670 --> 35:06.420
That is all you are!
That is all you will ever be!

35:06.420 --> 35:08.790
And I feel sorry for Rayna

35:08.790 --> 35:11.330
that you're all she had
to depend on!

35:19.120 --> 35:21.460
- Zach, let me
ask you a question.

35:21.460 --> 35:25.290
All this cutting the power
and the funds,

35:25.290 --> 35:29.830
and cozying up with Brad...

35:29.830 --> 35:32.830
it's just a smokescreen,
isn't it?

35:32.830 --> 35:34.500
- What are you talking about?

35:34.500 --> 35:35.880
- Why are you still here?

35:35.880 --> 35:37.120
How come you haven't left?

35:37.120 --> 35:40.080
- I told you!
I don't lose!

35:40.080 --> 35:44.880
- I don't think that's why.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.920
I think it's because
you're lonely.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.290
- Oh, shut up!

35:47.290 --> 35:48.920
You have no right
to say that to me, okay?

35:48.920 --> 35:50.500
You don't know me, Deacon!

35:50.500 --> 35:52.080
- I think I do, finally.

35:52.080 --> 35:56.080
I think you're the loneliest
person I ever met.

35:58.170 --> 35:59.790
Tell me all these months

35:59.790 --> 36:01.960
with Will and Scarlett
and the girls...

36:05.330 --> 36:07.080
have you been happy?

36:07.080 --> 36:10.080
I think you have maybe for
the first time in a long time.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.210
Because you weren't lonely.
You were part of a family.

36:12.210 --> 36:13.880
- A family that betrayed me.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.460
- No, Zach, a family
that disagreed with you.

36:15.460 --> 36:16.540
And went along with you anyway

36:16.540 --> 36:18.000
till finally you asked too much.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.500
You haven't left
because you love it here.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.540
And you don't want it to end.

36:22.540 --> 36:25.250
You keep making
these empty threats,

36:25.250 --> 36:27.460
and hoping somebody will
finally hear your desperation.

36:27.460 --> 36:31.330
Zach, it doesn't have to end.

36:31.330 --> 36:33.330
You have more money
than you will ever need.

36:33.330 --> 36:34.920
Why don't you just
let yourself be happy?

36:34.920 --> 36:37.750
- So what?
Set this up as a charity?

36:37.750 --> 36:39.380
Don't care about the money?
Let you do whatever you want?

36:39.380 --> 36:40.670
I'm sure you'd love that,
Deacon.

36:40.670 --> 36:43.540
- No, not a charity,
a partnership.

36:43.540 --> 36:45.500
Up till now, we've done
everything you're way

36:45.500 --> 36:47.120
all the way down the line.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.500
From here on out,
I'm saying we work together.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.210
We make decisions together.

36:56.670 --> 36:59.920
- Do you expect me
to accept that?

36:59.920 --> 37:02.540
- Zach, I think you already do.

37:11.540 --> 37:14.920
- Mackenzie called me
and told me what you did.

37:17.330 --> 37:19.540
She told me how
you sacrificed yourself.

37:19.540 --> 37:22.580
I know how much it meant
to make it right.

37:22.580 --> 37:25.000
- What about the others?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.500
- They all feel pretty much
the same, I think.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.080
It's just a real emotional time

37:29.080 --> 37:32.380
for Deacon and Maddie
right now, that's all.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.830
- I keep trying
to go back in time.

37:33.830 --> 37:37.920
Wishing myself back
to not do what I did.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.620
I can't undo it.

37:40.620 --> 37:44.580
- I think you might
have made up for it now.

37:44.580 --> 37:46.920
- I don't think so.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.670
I think I'm doomed
to make the same mistakes

37:49.670 --> 37:51.330
over and over again.

37:51.330 --> 37:54.040
Never able to see
them before they happen.

37:54.040 --> 37:59.620
Just constantly
cleaning up the mess.

37:59.620 --> 38:02.620
Like some darkness in me
that'll never go away.

38:02.620 --> 38:06.210
- Don't say that.

38:06.210 --> 38:08.920
- I think it's true.

38:10.380 --> 38:14.080
(crowd cheering)

38:14.080 --> 38:16.420
- Our next performance
features the artist

38:16.420 --> 38:18.830
that stole our hearts
at the CMT Music Awards

38:18.830 --> 38:20.250
earlier this year.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.330
And then had
a song stolen from her.

38:22.330 --> 38:23.710
Or something like that.

38:23.710 --> 38:25.540
If you're just
as confused as me,

38:25.540 --> 38:28.500

goes to...

40:37.040 --> 40:38.290
Katy Perry!

41:00.710 --> 41:02.250
- Hello?

41:04.250 --> 41:05.880
Juliette?

41:09.330 --> 41:10.580
- You came back.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.620
- Of course.

41:12.620 --> 41:13.880
Soon as I heard what you did.

41:26.670 --> 41:30.080
God, I've missed you.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.830
- I love you.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.830
- How do you feel?

41:46.670 --> 41:48.380
- Free.
