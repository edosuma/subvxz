WEBVTT

00:09.976 --> 00:11.409
Hey.
How was your summer?

00:11.544 --> 00:13.239
Hey, Gary.
How was your summer?

00:13.380 --> 00:14.779
Hey.
How was your summer?

00:14.914 --> 00:17.314
Hey, Jack!
There's my buddy.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.012
Walk with me, Lemon.

00:20.153 --> 00:21.814
You look great.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.388
I can't believe
I haven't spoken to you

00:23.523 --> 00:24.490
since your
heart attack.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.285
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.291
Nobody from corporate
knows about my cardiac event,

00:28.428 --> 00:29.520
and I want to leave it
that way.

00:29.662 --> 00:30.526
I'm back, Lemon.

00:30.663 --> 00:33.029
I've had the most productive
summer of my life. Me too.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.726
All of my summer
replacement shows were big hits.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.463
"America's Next Top Pirate. "
"Are You Stronger Than a Dog?"

00:38.605 --> 00:40.334
"MILF Island. "
"MILF Island"?

00:40.473 --> 00:42.805
"25 superhot moms.
50 eighth-grade boys.

00:42.942 --> 00:43.874
No rules. "

00:44.010 --> 00:45.068
Oh, yeah,
didn't one of those women

00:45.211 --> 00:46.269
turn out
to be a prostitute?

00:46.413 --> 00:48.904
That doesn't mean she's not
a wonderful, caring MILF.

00:50.717 --> 00:54.209
Well, I had a great summer, too.
And, um...

00:54.354 --> 00:56.219
Did you redecorate, or...

00:56.356 --> 00:58.620
Sir, I have all the latest
"Seinfeld-Vision" promos.

00:58.758 --> 00:59.986
Oh, wonderful.

01:00.126 --> 01:01.991
What's "Seinfeld-Vision"?

01:02.128 --> 01:04.221
Well,
I realized that NBC owns

01:04.364 --> 01:06.798
hundreds of hours
of footage of Seinfeld

01:06.933 --> 01:09.834
from his massively successful
television series, "Seinfeld. "

01:09.969 --> 01:12.938
So my old tech guys were able
to digitally capture Seinfeld,

01:13.073 --> 01:16.565
and now we can basically make
him do or say whatever we want.

01:16.709 --> 01:17.869
So for the month
of October,

01:18.011 --> 01:19.569
all of our prime-time shows
will feature

01:19.712 --> 01:22.806
a computerized guest appearance
from Mr. Jerry...

01:22.949 --> 01:24.211
Seinfeld.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.750
If you didn't kill her,
why didn't you stay?

01:26.886 --> 01:28.012
Quit grilling me!

01:28.154 --> 01:29.485
"Seinfeld-Vision"?

01:29.622 --> 01:31.988
Save the cheerleader,
save the world.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.194
Yeah!
That's what I said!

01:36.329 --> 01:37.819
"Seinfeld-Vision"?

01:37.964 --> 01:40.330
Deal or no deal?

01:40.467 --> 01:42.867
I'll take that deal!

01:45.338 --> 01:47.431
Does Jerry Seinfeld know
you're doing this?

01:47.574 --> 01:49.269
Jerry's in Europe
with his family right now.

01:49.409 --> 01:50.569
But by the time
he gets back,

01:50.710 --> 01:52.200
"Seinfeld-Vision" will be
a monster hit.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.176
His kids will go to school,
and their friends will say,

01:54.314 --> 01:56.782
"I really loved your dad on that
episode of 'Medium' last night. "

01:56.916 --> 01:59.043
And he's...
he's gonna love it.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.812
Uh-huh.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.546
Well, I had
a great summer, too.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.453
I started a quilt.
I did yoga twice a week.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.116
I wore flip-flops
in public.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.285
I really feel like
this is gonna be my year.

02:09.429 --> 02:12.057
"Biggest Loser. "
So, uh, what's up with Floyd?

02:12.198 --> 02:14.063
Uh, we broke up.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.498
We agreed that it was crazy
to try it long-distance.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.001
And I feel great
about it.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.002
Oh, come on.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.663
Lemon, if there's two things
I'm certain of,

02:20.807 --> 02:22.638
one is you will never
finish that quilt... I know.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.299
...and you are not
over Floyd.

02:24.444 --> 02:25.468
No, I really am, Jack.

02:25.612 --> 02:27.546
I'm telling you,
this is my year.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.375
I feel like
the show's gonna be great.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.144
And I'm very positive that
I'm gonna meet someone else.

02:32.285 --> 02:33.650
Lemon, women your age

02:33.786 --> 02:36.016
are more likely to be mauled
at the zoo than get married.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.681
Good to see you.
Bye.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.759
Glad we're both doing
so great.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.521
Put Floyd's name
on that quilt.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.915 --> 03:03.041
Yo, Ken, I'm gonna use

03:03.183 --> 03:04.810
this whole kitchen area
as my bathroom.

03:04.951 --> 03:05.815
Spread the word.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.249
What is this?

03:07.387 --> 03:08.615
Mr. Jordan's wife
kicked him out.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.655
She froze my credit cards,
Liz Lemon.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.314
And she got custody
of Grizz.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.449
Can I keep my cockatiel
in your office?

03:14.594 --> 03:16.824
No. Go home and apologize
to your wife.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.261
What?
I'm not apologizing.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.697
'Cause for once in my life,
I haven't done anything wrong.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.426
How many years
have you known me, Liz Lemon?

03:23.570 --> 03:24.332
One.

03:24.470 --> 03:27.371
So you know I like to minister
to transvestite prostitutes.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.168
I don't think
I did know that, no.

03:29.309 --> 03:30.708
It's true.
He doesn't mess with them.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.538
He just tries to get them
into computer school.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.169
So Labor Day weekend,

03:34.314 --> 03:37.374
I see this young she-dude
at the Dumpster by the 40/40.

03:37.517 --> 03:38.848
I pull over and I say,

03:38.985 --> 03:41.681
"You don't have to live
your life like this.

03:41.821 --> 03:44.051
You can be a freaky-deaky
and do data entry. "

03:44.190 --> 03:46.158
Sure. "What about court reporting?

03:46.292 --> 03:48.283
Believe in yourself!"

03:48.428 --> 03:49.122
Right.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.787
So as I reach in the trash
and pull this dude out,

03:51.931 --> 03:54.399
a paparazzo jumps out
and takes a picture of me.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.196
"Tracy Jordan and his
wife, Angie. " Oops.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.601
So not only are you holding
a transvestite prostitute...

03:59.739 --> 04:01.798
They confused shim with
Mrs. Jordan... Yes, ma'am.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.465
And they think
she looks better here

04:03.610 --> 04:05.237
than she did
at the 2004 Grammys.

04:05.378 --> 04:06.970
Who's gonna do
my banking?

04:07.113 --> 04:08.546
Who's gonna write my blogs?

04:08.681 --> 04:10.478
Who's gonna do the cooking
on taco Wednesdays?

04:10.617 --> 04:13.450
Okay, Kenneth, you are now
in charge of helping Tracy

04:13.586 --> 04:16.487
with any of the nonsexual things
that Angie would do for him.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.887
So he's, like,
my office wife?

04:19.024 --> 04:20.788
Sure.
Let's go with that.

04:22.462 --> 04:26.922
Kenneth Parcell,
would you take this ring...

04:27.066 --> 04:28.931
and sell it in the Jewish part
of Midtown

04:29.068 --> 04:30.899
and use the money to get us
a Nintendo Wii?

04:31.037 --> 04:34.097
Yes. Yes!
A thousand times, yes!

04:38.177 --> 04:40.008
Liz, how was your summer?

04:40.146 --> 04:42.205
Good. Floyd and I...
'Cause my play was amazing.

04:42.348 --> 04:43.337
There is nothing
like the thrill

04:43.483 --> 04:45.747
of doing a live show
on Broadway.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.582
You know, Jojo...

04:49.722 --> 04:53.123
When life
keeps handing you anchovies?

04:53.259 --> 04:56.353
Just cover them up
with some extra cheese?

04:56.496 --> 04:58.225
And make a pizza?

04:58.364 --> 05:01.527
I'm sorry I missed it.
It sounds just like the movie.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.533
What happened to you?
Do I look fat?

05:03.670 --> 05:05.763
Liz, I had to eat
four slices of pizza

05:05.905 --> 05:07.236
onstage
at each performance.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.534
Jenna, that's 32 pieces
of pizza a week!

05:09.676 --> 05:11.143
No.
That can't be right.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.245
Liz, it's like I flipped
the eating switch,

05:13.379 --> 05:14.539
and I can't flip it back.

05:14.681 --> 05:15.773
You have to help me.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.282
Well, how am I su...
Oh, it's worse from behind.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.477
I'm on it.

05:21.621 --> 05:24.055
She needs to lose 30 pounds
or gain 60.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.987
Anything in between
has no place on television.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.956
I can't believe
I missed you.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.455
Did Jack say anything
about my weight?

05:32.598 --> 05:34.463
No, he didn't even mention it.
He's not noticing.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.726
No one is noticing.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.836
Oh! Whoa!
Oh, damn! Yowza!

05:37.970 --> 05:39.904
Hey, Mr. Michelin,
I love your tires.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.133
Okay, everyone.
Welcome back.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.368
Some of you may be wondering

05:44.510 --> 05:47.536
what happened between me and my
boyfriend, Floyd, this summer.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.171
The answer is, we did break up,
but I am doing fine.

05:50.316 --> 05:51.442
Was Floyd
the black guy?

05:51.584 --> 05:53.484
Okay.
You don't care.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.519
I don't care, either.
So, great.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.249
I want a packet of 50 ideas from
each of you by tomorrow morning.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.552
What?
Come on! Oh, boo!

06:02.628 --> 06:04.926
Hey, I need
to ask you guys something.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.089
Move away from me.
Don't stand near me.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.863
Will you guys be bridesmaids
in my wedding?

06:10.002 --> 06:12.470
Oh, that is very sweet.

06:12.605 --> 06:16.132
But I think I might be
past bridesmaid age.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.173
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.005
Is it hard for you
because you just broke up

06:19.145 --> 06:20.476
with that Floyd guy?

06:20.613 --> 06:22.547
No! What? No.
That's...

06:22.682 --> 06:24.513
You know, I would love...

06:24.650 --> 06:27.050
We would love
to be your bridesmaids.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.518
Great. We need to go
dress shopping tomorrow, then.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.555
So meet me at Les Fesses
at 10:00 a. m.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.682
Yay!
Yay!

06:34.727 --> 06:37.321
Ohh.
Now I have my "something old. "

06:45.972 --> 06:47.530
Rise and shine,
Mr. Jordan.

06:47.673 --> 06:50.801
I couldn't sleep at all
last night.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.410
Angie kept
my Sharper Image

06:52.545 --> 06:54.740
white-noise
aromatherapy machine.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.475
She knows I can't sleep
without the sound of the ocean

06:57.617 --> 06:58.675
and the smell of bacon.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.911
Well, hurry up
and get your second wind,

07:01.053 --> 07:03.715
'cause I've got our day
all planned out.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.585
We'll start
at Bed Bath & Beyond

07:05.725 --> 07:08.216
and get all the things
that you're gonna need in here.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.794
Then an old friend of mine
from college

07:09.929 --> 07:11.556
is having her baby shower
out on Long Island,

07:11.697 --> 07:13.164
so we'll swing by there.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.164
And for dinner,
I thought we could just stay in

07:15.301 --> 07:17.326
and have the rest of that soup
that I made yesterday.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.131
I'm not doing any of that.

07:20.339 --> 07:22.432
Okay. Fine.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.135
I went with you
to your black vampire movie,

07:25.278 --> 07:26.643
but I guess
I'll just tell my friends

07:26.779 --> 07:27.746
that you have
a migraine.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.314
Great compromise,
office wife.

07:31.751 --> 07:32.911
Okay.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.403
Hey, you know where I could find
that Jack Donaghy?

07:54.841 --> 07:57.036
I got a bone to pick
with that guy.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.837
I don't know which bone
I'm gonna pick.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.969
But he's got some bones,
and I'm gonna pick one.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.481
Really?

08:14.594 --> 08:15.720
Weddings are so weird.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.830
This veil costs
more than my couch.

08:17.964 --> 08:21.491
Is that comedy, or do you
really have a $300 couch?

08:21.634 --> 08:22.601
Both.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.028
What, you never pretended
to be a bride

08:26.172 --> 08:27.196
when you were
a little girl?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.865
I did.
I just never romanticized it.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.274
This is my husband,
Sol Rosenbear.

08:33.412 --> 08:37.347
And this is his son, Richard,
from a previous marriage.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.246
And then he cheated on me
with a lamb.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.253
Oh. Liz, this dress is amazing.

08:43.389 --> 08:44.583
They don't have it
in my size.

08:44.724 --> 08:47.352
Can you try it on for me
so I can see how it hangs?

08:47.493 --> 08:50.257
Yes. You're closer, Liz.
You do it.

08:50.396 --> 08:52.421
I mean,
I could do it, but...

08:52.565 --> 08:54.931
Fun.
This is fun.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.268
Sir, Jerry Seinfeld
is here to see you.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.067
You told me he was in Europe.
Does he look upset?

09:02.208 --> 09:05.769
He looks the way you did when I
tried to hold your hand on the jet.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.106
Stall him a few minutes,
Jonathan,

09:07.246 --> 09:08.270
till I get
my ducks in a row.

09:08.414 --> 09:09.574
And get Legal
on the phone.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.419
Oh, my God.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.488
If I cover my good eye,

09:17.623 --> 09:18.954
you look just like
Courteney Cox.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.390
This one is really nice, Cerie.
And it's 40% off.

09:22.528 --> 09:23.290
Oh, no.

09:23.429 --> 09:26.125
Aris would kill me if I ever
bought a dress on sale.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.426
I can't.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.232
It really is nice,
isn't it?

09:33.372 --> 09:36.307
You should buy it
and save it for your wedding.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.171
No, no.
I'm... I'm single.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.243
Doing great.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.108
But don't you think you will
ever get married to anyone?

09:43.282 --> 09:45.011
You are trying
to make a sale.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.914
I know how this works.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.350
Oh, thank you.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.889
Hi. Jack?

09:52.024 --> 09:54.356
No, of course I'm at the office.
Yeah.

09:54.493 --> 09:55.653
Stall who?

09:55.795 --> 09:57.888
This is our control room. Uh-huh.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.726
There's nobody in there.
Sorry there's nothing to see.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.800
We just got back
from summer hiatus yesterday.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.562
Yeah.
Everybody's summer good?

10:04.704 --> 10:06.865
Oh, mine was great!
I read, like, two books.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.098
I broke up
with my boyfriend.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.707
But I'm doing great.
I'm totally over it.

10:09.842 --> 10:10.968
Mm-hmm.
Still talking?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.168
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:12.311 --> 10:15.109
I haven't talked to him since,
whoa, I don't know.

10:15.247 --> 10:18.148
August 9th, 4:17 p. M?

10:18.284 --> 10:19.342
Mm-hmm.
It's not over.

10:19.485 --> 10:20.952
Oh, no, it's over.
I'm over it.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.851
No, it's not over
till you pick up the phone,

10:23.990 --> 10:25.423
you say,
"I don't love you anymore. "

10:25.558 --> 10:27.458
They say, "I don't love you
anymore, either. "

10:27.593 --> 10:29.254
You go, "Great.
I'll pick you up in 20.

10:29.395 --> 10:30.487
Let's grab a scone. "

10:30.630 --> 10:31.562
A scone. Yes!

10:31.697 --> 10:33.392
I want that.
I'm gonna call him.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.056
Liz Lemon!

10:35.201 --> 10:36.566
I need you
to go to my house

10:36.702 --> 10:39.296
and pretend you're doing
a survey for the Ranford Group.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.998
And then ask my wife if she's
sleeping with D. L. Hughley.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.574
No, I'm not doing
any of that.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.733
J. S.!

10:44.877 --> 10:46.174
Oh, Tracy.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.040
What's up?

10:47.179 --> 10:50.046
Liz Lemon, me and this dude
used to do stand-up together.

10:50.182 --> 10:53.049
Remember that night we had the
three-way with Elayne Boosler?

10:53.185 --> 10:55.153
I don't think
that was me.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.118
Oh, yeah.
You know what?

10:57.256 --> 10:58.655
I think that was a mirror.

10:58.791 --> 10:59.621
Ah.

11:01.293 --> 11:02.885
J. S.,
this is my Kenneth.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.497
Ah, yeah. You again.
Hello.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.496
Jonathan, when is he gonna meet
with Jerry?

11:07.633 --> 11:08.565
This is taking forever.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.862
Mr. Donaghy left.
What? When?!

11:11.003 --> 11:13.369
Just a few minutes ago.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.171
Jack?

11:19.879 --> 11:20.903
Jack?

11:21.947 --> 11:23.244
Jack?

11:23.382 --> 11:25.407
Jerry?
Is that you?

11:25.551 --> 11:27.542
Nobody told me
you were here.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.847
Oh, I'm here,
Jack.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.354
Kenneth, why didn't you tell me
Mr. Seinfeld is here?

11:32.825 --> 11:34.884
What's wrong with him?

11:44.603 --> 11:45.570
Hello?

11:46.872 --> 11:50.103
Hello? I'm sorry.
May I speak to Floyd, please?

11:50.242 --> 11:51.903
Oh, he's in the shower.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.343
Well, I am conducting a survey
for the Ranford Group,

11:55.481 --> 11:56.880
and, uh...

11:57.016 --> 11:58.483
How old are you?

11:58.617 --> 12:00.312
And your weight?

12:00.453 --> 12:03.251
And when was the last time
you had intercourse?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.823
<i>Who is this?
Who are you?</i>

12:05.958 --> 12:08.756
I'm your worst nightmare
is who I is!

12:10.796 --> 12:13.128
He's got some girl
over there already!

12:13.265 --> 12:14.732
Wow.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.664
That is so embarrassing
for you.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.938
So how can I help you,
Jerry?

12:20.072 --> 12:22.063
Jack, I was vacationing
with my family in Europe

12:22.208 --> 12:24.233
in a country
only rich people know about.

12:24.376 --> 12:25.468
Svenborgia?

12:25.611 --> 12:27.135
No.
Better.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.439
But I can't tell you.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.811
Anyway, my mother called
to tell me

12:30.950 --> 12:32.577
that I'm gonna be on
"Law & Order. "

12:32.718 --> 12:33.844
And "ER."

12:33.986 --> 12:35.715
So I called my agent
to find out...

12:35.855 --> 12:37.652
when did I shoot
these things?

12:37.790 --> 12:39.087
That's the beauty of this,
Jerry.

12:39.225 --> 12:40.351
It's all done
with computers.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.892
When you see it,
you're gonna love it.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.791
<i>25 sexy moms,
50 sweaty eighth-grade boys,</i>

12:44.930 --> 12:47.398
<i>and one beloved
American comedy star.</i>

12:47.533 --> 12:49.364
<i>This Wednesday
on "MILF Island. "</i>

12:49.502 --> 12:52.096
Really?
Is that really your pitch?

12:52.238 --> 12:53.967
Okay. I get it.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.767
This is a two-way street.

12:55.908 --> 12:56.772
All right, Jerry.

12:56.909 --> 13:00.106
What NBC shows do you want to be
digitally inserted into?

13:00.246 --> 13:02.680
I like "Lost. "
Is that you guys?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.615
Jerry,
don't be difficult.

13:06.752 --> 13:07.650
The fact of the matter is

13:07.787 --> 13:09.220
that "Seinfeld-Vision"
is perfectly legal,

13:09.355 --> 13:10.822
and there's nothing you can do
to stop us.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.119
I'm sorry, but...
it's business.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.227
Here's some business...

13:15.361 --> 13:17.192
How 'bout I buy NBC

13:17.329 --> 13:20.526
and turn it into the biggest
Lane Bryant in Midtown?

13:22.835 --> 13:24.132
Jerry, come on.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.669
You're gonna buy NBC?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.000
Like you've got $4 million
just laying aroun...

13:30.042 --> 13:31.009
Jerry, I'm sorry.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.633
Give me two days,

13:32.778 --> 13:34.177
and I'll come up with something
you'll really be proud of.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.541
Besides, you owe me.

13:35.681 --> 13:36.943
Remember? St. Barts?

13:37.082 --> 13:38.242
I saved your life
from that shark?

13:38.384 --> 13:39.851
All right, Jack.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.976
I'll come back.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.521
But I still think
you shot a dolphin!

13:50.629 --> 13:53.359
Hi, I'm here to drop off
the inspiration photos.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.830
And you are the mother.

13:54.967 --> 13:55.956
Bridesmaid, yes.

13:57.002 --> 14:00.335
Th... That's my dress.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.133
Don't buy that.
That looks ugly on you.

14:03.642 --> 14:04.609
Yeah,
you'll thank me.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.574
Is that dress
still on sale?

14:06.712 --> 14:08.043
Yes.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.740
You know, a lot of women
buy their perfect dress

14:10.883 --> 14:12.180
when they see it

14:12.318 --> 14:14.684
and then just trust the fact
that the husband will come.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.152
Yeah.
Well, this is my year.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.587
I mean, Floyd's moving on.
I'm moving on, too.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.522
I'm just doing it
in my own order.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.686
I'm gonna get the wedding dress,
and then I'm gonna have a baby,

14:24.830 --> 14:25.990
and then I'm gonna die,

14:26.131 --> 14:28.065
and then I'm gonna meet
a supercute guy in heaven.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.100
Yeah.

14:30.236 --> 14:33.137
Yeah, I'm not kidding, blondie.
Get out of the dress.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.336
I'm gonna need to spread it over
a couple different credit cards.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.578
Lemon, I am
in full-blown crisis mode.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.307
I've already sold $20 million
worth of ad time

14:44.450 --> 14:45.417
for "Seinfeld-Vision,"

14:45.551 --> 14:46.950
and now Jerry wants
to pull the plug.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.917
But I don't care,
because I thrive in crisis mode.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.112
It's when I'm really
at my best.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.190
And the fact that I do not have
one idea how to solve this

14:52.324 --> 14:53.655
only energizes me more.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.350
I've been brainstorming
all night. Here we go.

14:55.494 --> 14:56.859
Number one...
Kill Seinfeld.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.486
Number two... Kill Seinfeld,
then kill myself.

14:58.631 --> 14:59.598
Number three...
Kill Seinfeld,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.427
flee to Svenborgia,
then kill myself.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.125
Jack, I'm not having
the best day either.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.827
Number 70...
You seduce Seinfeld.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.938
Now, why is me seducing Seinfeld
all the way at 70?

15:07.072 --> 15:08.539
Number 71...
I fake a hurricane

15:08.674 --> 15:10.642
and all regularly scheduled
programming is preempted.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.073
These are terrible ideas.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.338
There are no bad ideas
in brainstorming, Lemon.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.471
I'm sure I'll come up with
something at the eleventh hour.

15:16.615 --> 15:19.140
I always do.
'Cause I'm just that good.

15:22.688 --> 15:23.882
Mmm.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.594
It was on sale.

15:30.729 --> 15:31.821
Oh.

15:34.366 --> 15:35.492
I'm mad at you, Ken.

15:35.634 --> 15:37.625
I seen the way
you was looking at Seinfeld.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.795
You used to look at me
like that.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.669
What, am I not a big enough star
for you anymore?

15:42.808 --> 15:46.801
I am not even gonna dignify that
with an answer.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.413
Especially after
I picked out

15:48.547 --> 15:49.946
all these throw pillows
for in here,

15:50.082 --> 15:51.982
and you didn't even notice!

15:54.720 --> 15:57.018
Hey, everyone.
I know what you're thinking.

15:57.156 --> 15:59.351
How did I lose 25 pounds
in one day?

15:59.491 --> 16:01.516
I didn't.
It's visual trickery.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.218
Drawing the eye up.

16:04.930 --> 16:07.125
Hey, Liz,
you got to see this.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.927
Jenna looks bananas...

16:11.136 --> 16:13.798
Nope.
The real crazy is in here.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.133
Liz lost it.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.172
It was on sale.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.366
I thought
you and Floyd broke up.

16:17.509 --> 16:20.307
We did.
And I am doing great with it.

16:20.446 --> 16:21.879
I just bought a dress.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.346
Because, you know, I don't need
society's permission

16:24.483 --> 16:25.882
to buy a white dress.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.610
Who says this is
a wedding dress anyway?

16:27.753 --> 16:29.482
In Korea they wear white
to funerals.

16:29.621 --> 16:31.145
All right, uh,
I'm in charge now.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.723
Everyone go home.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.257
No.
I'm not crazy, Frank.

16:34.393 --> 16:35.417
I am making a statement...

16:35.561 --> 16:37.995
that, if need be,
I will marry myself.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.791
And I am not embarrassed

16:39.932 --> 16:41.695
that you guys
are seeing me wearing this.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.395
So you're intending
to wear that all day?

16:45.537 --> 16:47.767
Yeah, Chocolate Rain,
maybe I am.

16:47.906 --> 16:51.069
Liz, um, Seinfeld's here
and Jack's not ready for him,

16:51.210 --> 16:52.768
so you need to give him
another tour.

16:55.481 --> 16:56.448
Wonderful.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.646
Hello, Jerry.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.121
Well, well, well.

17:06.258 --> 17:07.724
So you called
that boyfriend.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.760
Yes, I did.
And it went well?

17:09.895 --> 17:11.624
No.
It didn't, Jer.

17:11.763 --> 17:12.890
A woman answered.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.465
Another woman already?
What did you say to her?

17:15.601 --> 17:16.761
I did a fake survey.

17:16.902 --> 17:18.096
You did the fake survey?!

17:18.237 --> 17:20.068
I know!
I'm not over it!

17:20.204 --> 17:23.766
And now I'm wearing this!
What is the deal with my life?!

17:23.909 --> 17:25.398
Are you imitating me?

17:25.544 --> 17:26.407
No!

17:26.545 --> 17:28.706
This is what I sound like
when I cry!

17:28.847 --> 17:30.314
I think
I'm a little insulted.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.679
You're insulted?
I'm crying!

17:48.634 --> 17:49.498
I got nothing.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.000
Mr. Seinfeld's here.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.001
I got nothing.

17:53.138 --> 17:56.198
Oh, Jerry, wonderful.
Please, come in. Come in.

17:56.341 --> 17:57.740
Can get you some water?

17:57.876 --> 17:58.740
No, thank you.

17:58.877 --> 17:59.809
Would you like some tea?

17:59.945 --> 18:01.242
Some coffee?
Some iced coffee?

18:01.380 --> 18:02.813
We have iced tea.
We have some juice.

18:02.948 --> 18:03.937
All right.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.778
Give me a water
if that just moves it along.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.148
Okay. Boy, have I got
a presentation for you.

18:08.287 --> 18:11.779
This presentation is going to,
uh, knock your socks off.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.323
Here, let me close
this window

18:13.459 --> 18:15.256
so we don't have any glare
on the monitor.

18:15.394 --> 18:17.055
How was your weekend?
It's Thursday.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.561
Well,
I mean last weekend.

18:18.697 --> 18:19.664
It was very nice.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.732
Can we just move this
presentation along, please?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.095
It's "Seinfeld-Vision"...

18:23.235 --> 18:27.638
and giving America
the programs they like

18:27.773 --> 18:29.297
with the star
that they love

18:29.441 --> 18:33.935
for one incredible month
of television.

18:34.079 --> 18:35.205
What the hell
are you doing?!

18:35.347 --> 18:37.508
God!
Oh, God, Jerry!

18:37.649 --> 18:39.708
God, Jerry!
I got nothing!

18:39.852 --> 18:40.978
I got nothing!

18:41.120 --> 18:43.554
You've got to do this for me,
please!

18:43.689 --> 18:45.714
Oh, God,
I've already sold the ad time.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.622
What is wrong
with you people?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.159
What's happened
to this network?

18:52.097 --> 18:53.621
Call off your goons!

18:53.765 --> 18:55.562
All right, Kenneth.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.669
All right, listen,
Seinfeld.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.327
I'll give you $1 million

18:59.471 --> 19:01.803
and five free commercials
for your animated feature,

19:01.940 --> 19:03.066
"Bee Movie. "

19:03.208 --> 19:04.732
And you let me run this
for one week.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.311
$2 million
to the charity of my choice,

19:07.446 --> 19:08.970
10 free commercials
for "Bee Movie"...

19:09.114 --> 19:11.412
opening November 2nd...
and I do nothing.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.211
You let me run "Seinfeld-Vision"
for three nights,

19:13.352 --> 19:16.321
I give you $1.5 million
for the charity of your choice,

19:16.455 --> 19:18.855
unlimited free promotions
on the "Today" show,

19:18.991 --> 19:21.016
and you give me the name
of that country you went to.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.253
One night.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.555
Doctors Without Borders.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.664
Roker in a bee costume.

19:29.368 --> 19:30.596
Grenyarnia.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.465
Oh, God.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.412
Oh, no!

19:42.548 --> 19:44.880
Did a Korean person die?

19:45.017 --> 19:48.077
No, Tracy.
It's a wedding dress.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.913
Don't do it, Liz Lemon.

19:52.057 --> 19:55.823
I know what me and Kenneth have
looks perfect on the outside.

19:55.961 --> 19:59.124
But it's work, damn it.
It's work.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.266
How'd it go with Seinfeld?

20:11.410 --> 20:12.638
I think
I pulled it off.

20:13.812 --> 20:16.110
Good God, Lemon.
What's happened to you?

20:16.248 --> 20:18.079
I thought this was
going to be your year.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.208
I couldn't even
hold it together one week.

20:20.352 --> 20:21.478
I'm not you, Jack.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.918
I can't have a heart attack and
pretend like it never happened.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.388
I can't break up with someone
and immediately recover.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.753
I'm not you.
I'm just me.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.521
Lemon, don't ever say
you're just you.

20:30.662 --> 20:32.254
Because you are better
than you.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.388
And I am not
going to let you give up.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.865
This is going to be
our year.

20:38.870 --> 20:39.962
Now give me the ham.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.267
I like the ham.
Come on.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.942
$4,000 ham napkin.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.649
I look pretty, though,
right?

20:59.791 --> 21:01.258
Don't push it, Lemon.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.593
When life
keeps handing you anchovies?

21:08.734 --> 21:11.703
Just cover them up
with some extra cheese?

21:11.837 --> 21:15.466
And make a pizza
with what you've got?

21:15.607 --> 21:19.873
Life is a pizza
with everything on top?

21:20.012 --> 21:21.741
Pizza?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.177
With what you've got?

21:23.315 --> 21:27.479
Life is a pizza
with everything on top?

21:27.619 --> 21:29.450
Pizza?

21:29.588 --> 21:31.453
What you've got?

21:31.590 --> 21:34.821
Pizza with everything on top?

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
