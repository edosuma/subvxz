WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.178
Previously
onMadam Secretary...We're renewing our vows.

00:04.221 --> 00:05.918
...the hour,
the minutewe picked

00:05.962 --> 00:08.269
has significance, too.Because it was the minute
that we both knew

00:08.312 --> 00:10.097
that we were getting
married: 8:22.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.663
It was actually this joke
that I told

00:11.707 --> 00:12.882
that really sealed the deal.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.102
Oh!
[yells]

00:15.145 --> 00:16.668
WIN:
...legalization of marijuana

00:16.712 --> 00:18.757
is the best way for the U.S.
to weaken the Mexican cartels.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.021
JAY: Arizona governor Barker
implemented a new policy

00:21.064 --> 00:22.805
of separating children
from parents

00:22.848 --> 00:24.459
who illegally cross the border.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.243
CARLOS: I am staunchly
against the federal government

00:26.287 --> 00:28.811
undermining a state's
authority to regulate

00:28.854 --> 00:30.943
its own border.Come on, Senator, you know

00:30.987 --> 00:32.380
there are a million reasons
the federal government

00:32.423 --> 00:34.121
has to be in charge
of the border.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.644
RICHARD:
You are trespassing

00:35.687 --> 00:37.559
on Arizona state property.

00:37.602 --> 00:40.170
ELIZABETH:
If desperate asylum seekers

00:40.214 --> 00:44.479
aren't free from being detained
unfairly in this state,

00:44.522 --> 00:45.958
why should I?

00:49.136 --> 00:52.574
[sighs] I guess you're
accustomed to...

00:52.617 --> 00:54.271
this sort of thing.

00:55.881 --> 00:58.101
Oh, Christ. I meant
social justice, not...

00:58.145 --> 01:00.669
Oh, Jesus, I just
said "Christ."

01:00.712 --> 01:02.540
And "Jesus"! I'm...

01:02.584 --> 01:04.716
My mother always said, "Don't
call him unless you need him,"

01:04.760 --> 01:06.153
so I think it's appropriate.[sighs]

01:06.196 --> 01:07.850
And yes, it isn't my first

01:07.893 --> 01:10.374
arrested-for-protesting
rodeo, but...

01:10.418 --> 01:12.681
it is the first time with a
presidential cabinet member.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.033
Well, we did what
we had to do.

01:18.382 --> 01:21.472
I think it was
Saint Augustine who said,

01:21.516 --> 01:24.432
"In the absence of justice,
what is sovereignty

01:24.475 --> 01:26.825
but organized robbery?"

01:26.869 --> 01:29.611
My husband is
a religious scholar.I'm well aware.

01:29.654 --> 01:33.441
I consider him a foremost
authority on Saint Francis.

01:33.484 --> 01:36.661
Oh. That is
so gonna make his day.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.228
[both chuckle]

01:38.272 --> 01:40.012
I understand speaking out,

01:40.056 --> 01:42.493
but why did you allow
yourself to get arrested?

01:42.537 --> 01:45.322
I have to believe you
have some... connections.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.890
What I saw in that detention
center crossed a line

01:47.933 --> 01:50.849
I never thought our
country would cross,
and I felt...

01:50.893 --> 01:54.375
obligated to make
the world pay attention.

01:54.418 --> 01:56.420
I feel like...

01:56.464 --> 02:00.337
the soul of our
country is at stake.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.686
I agree.

02:01.730 --> 02:04.211
And souls are my business.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.474
McCord, Elizabeth Adams.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.476
That's me.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.567
Turn to the side.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.526
RUSSELL:
Not exactly how we drew it up.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.833
Cable news is
losing its mind,

02:17.876 --> 02:21.358
and this may very well be the
meme that breaks the Internet.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.881
Governor Barker's
gone too far.

02:22.925 --> 02:25.319
Yeah, what
else is new?

02:25.362 --> 02:26.885
I'm sorry,

02:26.929 --> 02:28.626
but this is what happens

02:28.670 --> 02:30.802
when a self-promoting,
D.C.-hating,

02:30.846 --> 02:32.413
malignant narcissist

02:32.456 --> 02:34.284
gets his paws
on a national issue.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.156
And we should have
anticipated it!

02:36.199 --> 02:38.549
The arrest is drawing attention
to the issue.

02:38.593 --> 02:39.942
Oh, fantastic.

02:39.985 --> 02:42.031
The families are
still separated.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.989
The Mexican border
deal is-is dead.

02:44.033 --> 02:47.819
President Zaragoza is talking
U.N. resolutions against us

02:47.863 --> 02:50.692
and practically sending troops
to the Arizona border!

02:50.735 --> 02:52.868
And our once-popular,

02:52.911 --> 02:56.088
future-president Secretary
of State is behind bars!

02:56.132 --> 02:59.091
I'm not sure how much attention
all that's worth, Professor.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.615
Russell, history
has taught us

03:00.658 --> 03:04.227
that we must confront injustice
head-on when we find it.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.142
That's exactly
what Elizabeth is doing.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.796
What, by wandering miles
beyond her mandate

03:07.839 --> 03:09.232
as Secretary of State?

03:09.276 --> 03:11.713
Literally!I would argue
that what she is doing

03:11.756 --> 03:14.063
is precisely her mandate.

03:14.106 --> 03:16.587
She swore to uphold
the Constitution.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.241
Arizona's
separation policy

03:18.285 --> 03:20.939
represents
an institutional erosion

03:20.983 --> 03:22.332
of civil and human rights.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.943
It threatens our way of life.I don't like

03:24.987 --> 03:26.293
what Barker's doing
any more than you do,

03:26.336 --> 03:28.077
but there's more than
one way to skin a cat.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.861
Mainly, not in jail!

03:29.905 --> 03:31.776
Jail might be precisely
the way to skin this cat,

03:31.820 --> 03:33.648
because it is noisy.

03:33.691 --> 03:37.086
Look, the bellwether
of a crumbling democracy
is always

03:37.129 --> 03:38.653
a violation of
human rights.

03:38.696 --> 03:39.958
Look at Nazi Germany.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.438
North Korea.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.311
Ghana under Kwame Nkrumah.

03:44.354 --> 03:47.183
Iraq under Saddam Hussein.I think it's a
little premature

03:47.227 --> 03:48.793
to be lamenting the death
of our democracy.

03:48.837 --> 03:51.622
That is exactly what everyone
said in those countries

03:51.666 --> 03:52.841
as human rights eroded.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.495
All right, fine.
But your wife

03:54.538 --> 03:58.194
is torching her chances
of becoming president

03:58.238 --> 04:01.719
and saving our franchise
from lunatics like Barker.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.504
Those mug shots

04:03.547 --> 04:05.506
won't exactly look good
on a campaign poster,

04:05.549 --> 04:06.811
but you can bet
her opponents

04:06.855 --> 04:08.160
will be printing them up
on T-shirts!

04:08.204 --> 04:10.467
Enough.

04:10.511 --> 04:13.731
How do we put a stop to Barker
and reunite the families?

04:13.775 --> 04:15.733
Right now I'm considering
sending in the National Guard.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.561
Sir, I... I think

04:17.605 --> 04:19.824
that would be playing
right into Barker's hands.

04:19.868 --> 04:20.825
I agree.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.523
He's already elevated

04:22.566 --> 04:24.525
his stature
by taking on Elizabeth.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.136
And who the hell outside
of Arizona even heard of
this guy before today?

04:27.179 --> 04:30.182
That's right. Now that
this has blown up, Mr.
President, any attention

04:30.226 --> 04:32.402
from you will give him
even more notoriety.

04:32.446 --> 04:33.751
Well, what, then?

04:33.795 --> 04:35.492
I need a plan of attack.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.799
[sighs] Unfortunately,
I think it's best

04:37.842 --> 04:39.540
not to attack, sir.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.107
Better to...
avoid a public showdown.

04:42.151 --> 04:45.328
Let this fire burn itself out.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.504
Meanwhile, we work to
get Elizabeth released,

04:47.548 --> 04:50.115
and de-escalate the situation...

04:50.159 --> 04:52.901
focus on fighting
the family separations in court.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.425
[sighs]:
Fine.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.514
Let's send an army
of White House lawyers

04:57.558 --> 04:58.820
to handle it.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.126
I'd like
to send Mike B.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.214
to represent Elizabeth
personally.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.868
And I'm gonna go
down there, too.

05:03.912 --> 05:06.088
Of course.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.090
Fresh printouts.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.700
I divided them into domestic...

05:09.744 --> 05:10.832
Mm-hmm....and international.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.486
Oh. And the mug shot

05:12.529 --> 05:14.618
is officially a meme.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.011
Fantastic.No shooting
the messenger.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.621
Hey, Stevie.Frankie. Hi.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.841
Hey, uh, Russell wanted me
to give you these talking points

05:19.884 --> 05:21.146
before the press conference.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.105
Yeah, I got his e-mail.
I mean, you didn't need

05:23.148 --> 05:24.628
to hand-deliver it.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.762
I actually kind of wanted
an excuse to get in here.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.851
I need your help.
I-It's not about anything

05:29.894 --> 05:32.462
happening today-- it's
for the party, the vow renewal.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.246
Yeah, this is me
staring incredulously at you

05:34.290 --> 05:36.901
even before I know
what the problem is.The band cancelled

05:36.945 --> 05:39.904
at the last minute, and I can't
find anyone to replace them.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.993
You're worried about a band
when your mother is in jail?

05:42.037 --> 05:43.299
Mike B. is on that.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.214
I'm sure that she will
be out in no time.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.912
But this party
is unstoppable.

05:47.956 --> 05:50.393
I was thinking-- I was
remembering, really--

05:50.437 --> 05:51.960
last year when you
and Blake and Jay...

05:52.003 --> 05:53.701
No.
...came and sang at
our holiday party.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.442
Nope.Why not?

05:55.485 --> 05:58.140
Because that was people singing
around a piano for atmosphere.

05:58.183 --> 06:01.056
You did notice
the significant lack of dancing.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.145
Maybe if you guys...
picked up the pace?

06:03.188 --> 06:05.321
Okay, even if I thought
it was a good idea,

06:05.365 --> 06:07.454
I don't have time
to learn a bunch of songs.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.457
Why don't you hire a deejay?It just feels so impersonal.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.806
Stevie,
if your mother

06:11.849 --> 06:13.198
gets out of jail in time,

06:13.242 --> 06:15.331
I'm sure she'll be happy
with Spotify.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.898
Sorry. I got to go.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.073
It's just that it's
tomorrow night,

06:18.116 --> 06:19.422
and they really want a band,

06:19.466 --> 06:21.816
and Laser Dawn was perfect.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.688
They were one of the top
cover bands in D.C.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.255
specializing in '70s covers,

06:26.298 --> 06:29.040
including and especially...

06:29.084 --> 06:32.217
Peter Frampton's "Baby,
I Love Your Way,"

06:32.261 --> 06:33.784
which is my mom's favorite.

06:33.828 --> 06:34.785
Really?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.134
Not judging.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.659
Also Bee Gees, "How
Deep Is Your Love."Huh.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.661
So now I am just,
like, on my knees

06:40.704 --> 06:42.271
to all these second-rate bands,

06:42.314 --> 06:43.707
and I'm just getting
nothing but no.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.361
Even knowing
who your mom is?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.494
Well, I didn't
tell them that.
I thought

06:47.537 --> 06:50.018
I wasn't supposed to.Are you kidding me?
Lead with that.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.150
It's the only way to get
anything done in this town.

06:52.194 --> 06:55.110
Aim higher, girl.Okay.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.590
[whispers]:
Thanks.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.200
MAN: How long will
the secretary be in jail?

06:58.243 --> 07:00.028
WOMAN: Was Secretary McCord
acting under the direction...

07:00.071 --> 07:02.378
DAISY:
Secretary McCord was acting on
behalf of the administration.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.147
Oh.

07:32.190 --> 07:35.716
You okay?I'm fine. Yeah.

07:35.759 --> 07:38.196
You know when I told you
to focus on voter intensity,

07:38.240 --> 07:39.937
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.244
Can we just whistle
past the reprimand, please?

07:42.287 --> 07:44.725
Fine. I have arranged
for you a plea deal.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.770
You plead guilty to
misdemeanor trespass,

07:46.814 --> 07:48.642
you'll be released
immediately with
a small fine.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.255
Oh, God, this isn't viewed
with gratitude, is it?

07:55.126 --> 07:56.998
I can't plead guilty.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.347
You so can.I can't.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.523
You plead guilty.Not only does it

08:00.567 --> 08:03.613
go against my integrity,
but it sets a bad precedent

08:03.657 --> 08:05.876
with respect
to federal authority.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.443
I was just doing my job.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.967
I was escorting
a foreign dignitary

08:10.011 --> 08:13.710
to check on his citizens.Okay, well, just so you and
your integrity are aware,

08:13.754 --> 08:16.365
you will be charged
with felony trespass

08:16.408 --> 08:18.759
and you can kiss
POTUS good-bye.

08:18.802 --> 08:21.413
That's not lost on me, Mike.

08:21.457 --> 08:23.807
I have a few dozen
calls to make.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.330
I'll let you
think about that.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.554
Henry, the faces

08:31.598 --> 08:33.164
of those kids.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.862
The world has to see that.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.559
They have to
really get it.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.734
And if I...

08:37.778 --> 08:40.302
if I plead guilty,
the headlines will pull

08:40.345 --> 08:42.217
to the wrong thing.But you have

08:42.260 --> 08:44.132
to consider what
you've already accomplished.

08:44.175 --> 08:47.222
People areaware, and you can do
a lot more good outside of jail.

08:47.265 --> 08:50.138
Not to mention the good
you can do in the world
as president.

08:50.181 --> 08:53.358
Are you willing to risk that?I think that
viral mug shot's

08:53.402 --> 08:55.578
probably already blown
that out of the water.That's just an image.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.754
That'll go away.
A felony conviction,

08:57.798 --> 08:59.451
that's another matter.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.541
Well, whose side
are you on?

09:06.371 --> 09:08.243
I support
any decision you make.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.419
You've got to follow
your conscience.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.726
JFK said,
"There's something immoral

09:12.769 --> 09:15.424
about abandoning
your own judgment."

JFK in a movie.

exciting, but, uh,

09:40.144 --> 09:41.493

Good afternoon,

09:47.848 --> 09:50.502
Good afternoon,
Secretary McCord.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.374
Good afternoon,
Your Honor.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.724
How do you plead
to the charge of one count

09:54.768 --> 09:57.118
misdemeanor criminal trespass?You know it's not too late
to talk about this...

09:57.161 --> 09:58.946
Don't need to.
Not guilty.

09:58.989 --> 10:01.818
In that case, Judge,
since defendant is not
availing herself

10:01.862 --> 10:03.820
of our plea offer, the People
would like to proceed

10:03.864 --> 10:06.257
with one charge of felony
criminal trespass.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.738
[gallery gasps]Understood.
How do you plead to that, ma'am?

10:08.782 --> 10:10.479
Bess, for the love
of God...
Not guilty.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.396
[groans]Sorry about him, Your Honor.

10:14.439 --> 10:15.789
JUDGE:
I've had worse.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.660
Now...

10:17.704 --> 10:19.706
out of respect
for your position

10:19.749 --> 10:22.273
as Secretary of State,
I order you released

10:22.317 --> 10:24.580
from custody immediately

10:24.624 --> 10:26.974
on your own
recognizance,
no bail,

10:27.017 --> 10:29.150

promise to appear

10:29.193 --> 10:30.891

courtroom proceedings.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.893
No, Your Honor.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.938
Bess, come on.
Excuse me,
ma'am,

10:34.982 --> 10:37.245
are you refusing my...
my orders?

10:37.288 --> 10:39.377
I-I mean no disrespect,
Your Honor.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.815
But I'm going to refuse
to leave prison

10:41.858 --> 10:45.383
until all the detained children
are reunited with their parents.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.180
And, Your Honor,

10:59.223 --> 11:01.269
if you don't mind, could
I just say a couple of words

11:01.312 --> 11:03.227
before I... go to jail?

11:03.271 --> 11:04.446
Go for it.

11:07.014 --> 11:11.279
No one should rest until this
inhumane practice is stopped.

11:11.322 --> 11:14.717
All Arizonans, all Americans

11:14.761 --> 11:16.937
should make their voices heard.

11:16.980 --> 11:20.070
In fact, I am certain

11:20.114 --> 11:23.726
that if every American could see
what is happening inside

11:23.770 --> 11:27.121
the Arizona State Detention
Facility in Sasabe,

11:27.164 --> 11:30.167
they would do everything
they could to end it.

Because this is not who we are.

Look, the secretary is
torching her storied career,

have to wall off the rest

Sit down, already.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.150
I have no quibble with
what's in her heart.

12:40.194 --> 12:43.284
My problem is she's flying solo

12:43.327 --> 12:45.068
when we all need to be
rowing together.

12:45.112 --> 12:47.723
I-- I'm aware
of the mixed metaphor.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.595
The point is, if she's going
down in flames,

12:50.639 --> 12:52.772
she is not gonna take
the administration with her.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.383
And if that-that hearing

12:55.426 --> 12:57.864
was any indication,
her trial next week

12:57.907 --> 13:00.954
is gonna be a three-ring
media circus, which is bad

13:00.997 --> 13:03.086
for the business of government.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.567
We need a nice choral trio.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.309
Polite. Ordered. Calming.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.357
It's bad for the country.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.577
Arizona's child separation
policy is worse.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.448
It demands a noisy response,
maybe even a circus.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.799
I didn't call you here for
your opinion, all right?Too bad.

13:19.842 --> 13:20.930

13:25.630 --> 13:27.067
Say what you want to say.

The president should issue

13:28.590 --> 13:31.549

the secretary, get behind her,

13:38.600 --> 13:40.732
If I had my way,
Governor Barker

13:40.776 --> 13:42.256
would be on his
way to The Hague.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.606
But this, this is
about process,

13:44.649 --> 13:46.564
and what's best
for our democracy.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.958
I couldn't agree more.Okay.

Look. You might be

13:51.308 --> 13:53.223

13:53.267 --> 13:57.053
The point is, the job isn't
about doing what's right.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.881
It's about doing what's best.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.448
And that is right.

14:00.491 --> 14:03.364
Is cynicism a prerequisite
for the job?

14:03.407 --> 14:04.974
Cynical pragmatism.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.586
from every possible
angle all at once,

best for the country.

is willing to go to jail

15:10.648 --> 15:13.434
Public opinion is turning
against you, Governor.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.784
The latest snap poll taken
in the last hour

15:15.827 --> 15:19.483
shows that 90% of Americans are
against family separations.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.746
I don't govern by polls,
Mr. President.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.748
Fair enough.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.055
But I think we can agree that
your sheriff took things too far

15:26.099 --> 15:28.405
by arresting Secretary McCord.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.017
No, sir. Law's the law.

None of us is above it.

Clearly, we don't see
eye to eye on much.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.545
But how about this?

15:37.588 --> 15:39.460
I can offer you
a seat at the table

15:39.503 --> 15:41.505

of border governors

15:41.549 --> 15:43.899

15:43.943 --> 15:45.901
on the border security deal
with Mexico.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.990
We both know that that's what
this is really about.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.514
And I'm willing to compromise,

15:50.558 --> 15:52.038
providing you reunite
the families

15:52.081 --> 15:54.649
and release Secretary McCord
today.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.825
Let's get past this ugliness
and work together.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.306
You think my base wants
compromise?

15:59.349 --> 16:00.916
I get 10,000 folks at my rallies
in Tucson.

rip up that feckless immigration
bill you signed over the summer,

16:12.623 --> 16:16.453

about border security.

16:16.497 --> 16:19.021
You know that's not going
to happen, Governor.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.850

to talk about.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.208
I want all options on the table.

16:32.252 --> 16:36.125
And I can't worry about how much
attention this brings to Barker.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.258
We have to end this even if
it means getting in the mud.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.173

Look, if we're gonna do this
quickly, we need to draw blood.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.010
There has to be some

16:51.053 --> 16:53.273
federal statue somewhere
that Barker's breaking

16:53.316 --> 16:56.667
by detaining all these people
extrajudicially.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.800
Okay. You really want
to ratchet things up

16:58.843 --> 17:00.323
and play hardball?

17:00.367 --> 17:01.672
We argue that
this current policy

17:01.716 --> 17:04.023
Barker is enforcing
is beyond the scope

17:04.066 --> 17:06.025
of his mandate as
chief executive of the state.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.896
To what end?Well, normally,

17:07.939 --> 17:10.420
a sitting governor is shielded
from personal liability

17:10.464 --> 17:13.380
as long as he's acting in his
official capacity.

17:13.423 --> 17:16.513
But we argue that this
separation policy

17:16.557 --> 17:19.125
is such an egregious
violation of human rights

17:19.168 --> 17:21.649
and so completely
outside the scope

17:21.692 --> 17:23.564
of the state's domain
that, by definition,

17:23.607 --> 17:27.785
Barker is acting beyond his role
as governor by ordering it.

17:27.829 --> 17:30.049
And we charge him
with kidnapping.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.227
Isn't that a bit of a stretch?

17:34.270 --> 17:37.404
Oh, no, it's a lot of a stretch.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.235
I like it.DALTON:
Get it in the works.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.411

Sure, I'll send you all of
the details in an e-mail,

17:53.333 --> 17:55.944

tomorrow morning.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.989
That would be great.

to finding a cure.

That's a band, I hope.

it is the best
wedding band in town.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.447
This is gonna happen.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.144
I'm glad
you've made progress,

18:22.188 --> 18:24.625
because Jason and I are
nowhere on our project.

18:24.668 --> 18:27.280
Yeah. Because you rejected
my stand-up comedy idea,

18:27.323 --> 18:29.282
and now you're rejecting
my Mad Libs idea.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.805
Because they both equally
sucked.

now the only missing piece.

a visual person.

"this is a dumb idea" person.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.875
I sent out a Hail Mary
to Laser Dawn,

18:57.919 --> 19:00.269
asking if they would
consider reuniting

19:00.313 --> 19:04.186
for the Secretary of State
and they said yes.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.537
We just went from having no band
to being double booked.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.323
Ooh, and apparently, healing
the wounds of Laser Dawn.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.412
We are the world, dude.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.675
Oh, man, Daisy wasn't kidding
about aiming higher.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.938
JASON: Yeah.
ALISON: Mm.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.635
Hey, I got the basket from Win.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.202
Thanks for sending it over.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.682
DAISY [over phone]:
He wants you to know

19:21.725 --> 19:23.074
he didn't injure you on purpose

19:23.118 --> 19:25.164
and he still wants a sit-down
with M-Sec.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.427
I'm sure he does.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.907
Hey, did Nolan really pitch
charging Barker with kidnapping?

19:29.951 --> 19:32.432
And POTUS is champing
at the bit.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.434
What's the latest there?

19:34.477 --> 19:36.523
Well, the narrative has shifted
in her favor, which is good.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.133
But she's still locked up.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.874
It's uncharted territory.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.355
How's the leg?

19:42.398 --> 19:44.313
It hurts like hell.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.403
Doc says it'll feel like this
for a few days.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.231
I know I'm not getting
any sleep tonight.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.406
You should take something.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.842
You have to be on your game
tomorrow.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.192
It's gonna be a big day.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
Yeah, I know.
I'll think about it.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.196
All right. Take care.You, too.

19:59.633 --> 20:03.419
Space Jammies Indica gummies.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.987
THC pain cream.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.250
Marijuana edibles.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.600
No way.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.646
All those baby goats
have pajamas?[goats bleating on video]

20:12.689 --> 20:14.648
[laughs]

20:14.691 --> 20:16.954
Because they're cold.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.391
Oh,

20:18.434 --> 20:20.915
why don't all...

20:20.958 --> 20:23.222
farm animals have pajamas?

20:23.265 --> 20:26.399
Not the cows,
but the little ones, anyway.

20:26.442 --> 20:29.271
That's... that's so doable.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.711
Idea. Pajamas for small
farm animals.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.539
Pitch to
Department of Agriculture.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.455
[phone ringing]

20:39.499 --> 20:41.718
Jay Whitman. Who's this?

20:41.762 --> 20:43.154
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Hello.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.852
You have a collect call
from an inmate

20:44.895 --> 20:46.941
of the Arizona Penitentiary.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.290
ELIZABETH [recorded]:
Elizabeth McCord.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.857
[Jay grunts]

20:49.900 --> 20:51.293
AUTOMATED VOICE:
To accept, say yes.

20:51.337 --> 20:54.122
To decline, say no.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.167
To accept, say yes.Yes.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.908
Yes. God, yes.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.736
Ma'am.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.825
Hey, it took you a minute there.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.045
Promise I'll pay you back.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.612
No, it's not that.
I just got confused.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.266
You don't call me from jail
every day.

21:07.309 --> 21:10.312
I mean, nobody does.
I mean, not that it's...

21:10.356 --> 21:13.533
That jail's bad. You...
How are you?

21:13.576 --> 21:17.145
I'm fine. I...

21:17.188 --> 21:20.322
They let me make phone calls
whenever I want.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.586
They let Henry get
some clothes to me,

21:23.630 --> 21:26.633
and they even put a divider
around my bed so I have privacy.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.374
I'm fine.[laughs]

21:28.417 --> 21:30.071
Jay?

21:30.114 --> 21:31.768
Oh. Sorry. The image is...

21:31.812 --> 21:33.335
You sound a little weird.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.249
I'm sorry, ma'am.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.732
These are weird times.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.821
Can't argue with that.

21:40.864 --> 21:42.997
Listen, now that public opinion

21:43.040 --> 21:45.652
has swung so decisively

21:45.695 --> 21:49.133
against the family separation
policy,

21:49.177 --> 21:51.005
I think it's worth taking

21:51.048 --> 21:53.137
another crack
at convincing Morejon

21:53.181 --> 21:55.575
to help out with
the legislative option.

21:55.618 --> 21:59.361
Unlike Barker,
he has national ambitions

21:59.405 --> 22:02.103
and he can't afford to define
his base so narrowly.

22:02.146 --> 22:04.410
Sure. Yeah. We-we--
It's worth a try.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.803
We don't really have a choice.

22:06.847 --> 22:10.198
I heard you were in the room
when the A.G. suggested...

22:10.241 --> 22:13.375
[quietly]: going after Barker
for kidnapping.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.508
And I think that
if we don't do something soon,

22:15.551 --> 22:17.945
POTUS will call in
the National Guard and...

22:17.988 --> 22:19.599
that'll trigger the biggest
federal-state showdown

22:19.642 --> 22:21.383
since the Civil War.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.558
Wow.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.343
Yeah. So,

22:24.386 --> 22:26.562
meet with Morejon
first thing in the morning.

22:26.606 --> 22:30.740
And just in case the shift
in public opinion isn't enough,

22:30.784 --> 22:32.742
try to come up with some--

22:32.786 --> 22:34.918
I don't know-- something.
Some extra angle or inducement

22:34.962 --> 22:36.267
that can win him over.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.008
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.837
I'll get started on that,
like, now.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.012
Sorry to ruin your night.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.753
What do you mean?

22:43.797 --> 22:45.581
Wait, what do you mean?

22:45.625 --> 22:48.497
I mean that you're gonna have
to work late and...

22:48.541 --> 22:50.151
Yeah.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.240
No. I mean,
that's-that's my pleasure.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.981
It's my job. It's my job.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.809
Thank you. That's...

22:55.852 --> 22:57.332
I'll talk to you soon.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.290
Mm. Bye.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.426
Oh, my God.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.036
That was hard.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.604
[ringtone plays]

23:08.648 --> 23:10.040
Hey, Jay. What's up?

23:10.084 --> 23:11.564
I'm on a kind of painkiller.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.130
Congratulations.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.131
So, I don't know if this idea--

23:14.175 --> 23:15.132
Wait, wait, where are you?

23:15.176 --> 23:16.960
I am driving to Aguila

23:17.004 --> 23:18.788
to visit my father.Oh.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.224
That's probably not
gonna be easy.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.357
How long has it been?[exhales]

23:22.401 --> 23:23.750
Been a couple years. I'm, uh...

23:23.793 --> 23:25.360
just hoping for the best.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.275
Okay.

23:27.318 --> 23:28.276
Good luck.

23:28.319 --> 23:29.930
Thanks.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.195
What's your idea?

23:34.238 --> 23:35.849
What? Oh, right.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.459
So, M-Sec wants me
to meet with Morejon

23:37.503 --> 23:39.026
first thing in the morning
to take another swing

23:39.069 --> 23:40.462
at the legislative option,
and I want to know if this idea

23:40.506 --> 23:42.203
is good crazy
or Jay-you're-fired...

23:42.246 --> 23:43.770
crazy.[chuckles]: Okay.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.902
All right, let's hear it.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.252
Did you know studies have shown
that THC outperforms

23:48.296 --> 23:50.472
most prescription sedatives
and has no side effects?

23:50.516 --> 23:51.821
Did not know.Yeah.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.257
You get me ten minutes
with your boss,

23:53.301 --> 23:55.869
I-I promise
she'll love you for it.[chuckles]

23:55.912 --> 23:57.871
You might even end up with
her job when she's promoted.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.786
[laughs]Sorry to interrupt.
Tight window, pal.

23:59.829 --> 24:02.223
Oh, hey, buddy. Look,
look, here's my card.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.051
Call anytime.
Let's get this done.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.314
I'm feeling it.[chuckles]

24:06.357 --> 24:07.315
You ever stop?

24:07.358 --> 24:09.056
I'm blessed. I love pot.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.971
Believe in what I preach.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.799
Thanks for doing this
on short notice.[phone chimes]

24:12.842 --> 24:16.150
Anytime, brother. Psyched to
be recruited into the fight.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.326
Well, the senator
is about to get out

24:18.369 --> 24:20.328
of a Presidential Advisory
Commission meeting.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.199
Love it. I'm the
king of the ambush.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.855
Not that I ever
ambushed you.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.683
That's always
a coincidence.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.206
[chuckles]

24:29.250 --> 24:31.252
Just...Yeah.

24:32.601 --> 24:33.820
[exhales]

24:33.863 --> 24:36.257
Must be how
a predator feels, huh?

24:36.300 --> 24:40.566
Waiting ever so patiently
in the tall grass to pounce.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.263
I'm a lion, Jay.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.656
For my country.

24:43.699 --> 24:46.180
Just don't screw
this up.

24:46.223 --> 24:47.181
[door opens]

24:47.224 --> 24:48.399
Wait for it.

24:48.443 --> 24:49.531
[indistinct chatter]

24:49.575 --> 24:51.490
Okay, now.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.709
Hey, uh, Senator.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.363
What a coincidence.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.365
How's that?I was about to call you.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.846
But if you have a sec now,
I'd-I'd love to...

24:59.889 --> 25:02.283
run something by you.Sure.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.851
Look, first, I want to apologize
for the other night, okay?

25:04.894 --> 25:07.027
Emotions have been running high,
mine especially.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.203
And I'd just really like you
to know that I respect

25:09.246 --> 25:10.552
that you're in a tough spot.

25:10.596 --> 25:11.814
Okay.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.250
But now
the whole country,

25:13.294 --> 25:14.643
including most of Arizona,

25:14.687 --> 25:17.907
is rallying behind M-Sec
and outraged by the policy.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.606
So I-I'd like to revisit
the idea of you sponsoring

25:20.649 --> 25:22.521
a bill to force
Governor Barker's hand.

25:22.564 --> 25:25.915
My position has not changed.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.352
If I may, Senator,
I think I have a way

25:28.396 --> 25:29.658
for you to help reunite
the families

25:29.702 --> 25:31.442
and still be tough
on immigration.

25:31.486 --> 25:32.531
How's that?

25:32.574 --> 25:34.141
I read every speech you've given

25:34.184 --> 25:35.708
over the last ten years
about illegal immigration,

25:35.751 --> 25:38.058
and you always say
the biggest underlying cause

25:38.101 --> 25:39.886
is the flow of drugs
across the border.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.540
That's right.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.542
I have someone I'd
like you to meet.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.935
This is Win Barrington.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.981
The pot lobbyist?

25:48.024 --> 25:50.026
[laughs] My mom reacted
pretty much the same way

25:50.070 --> 25:51.593
when I told her
what I was doing.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.160
So I get it.

25:53.203 --> 25:56.337
But, Senator, there is no better
way to defang the syndicates

25:56.380 --> 25:57.991
and gangs trafficking
over our borders

25:58.034 --> 26:00.123
than to take away
their biggest market.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.604
The kingpins are terrified
of legalization.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.780
Not only would it
cripple their business,

26:04.824 --> 26:07.740
it would significantly curtail
the flow of all illicit drugs

26:07.783 --> 26:09.176
over the border.
Legalization of marijuana

26:09.219 --> 26:10.394
in certain states
is already

26:10.438 --> 26:12.222
weakening
the Mexican drug cartels.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.790
And marijuana grown legally
in the U.S. is cheaper

26:14.834 --> 26:17.663
and better than what the cartels
are smuggling over the border,

26:17.706 --> 26:20.361
which is effectively
pricing the cartels out.

26:20.404 --> 26:23.669
I don't make policies based
on theories, Mr. Barrington.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.279
Where's the evidence?

26:25.322 --> 26:27.107
[chuckles]
You're right.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.631
That's my bad. Some people
get spun by data.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.198
But here are the numbers.

26:31.241 --> 26:33.592
Ten years ago, U.S. Customs
and Border Patrol seized

26:33.635 --> 26:36.072
over four million pounds
of marijuana at the border.

26:36.116 --> 26:38.248
Last year, it was down
to less than a million.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.729
And with less cartel
activity, violent crime

26:40.773 --> 26:42.905
in border states that have
legalized marijuana

26:42.949 --> 26:45.125
has gone down an
average of 13%.

26:45.168 --> 26:47.431
That's why
marijuana legalization is

26:47.475 --> 26:49.738
directly linked to
stronger border security.

26:49.782 --> 26:53.307
861,231 pounds of
marijuana were seized

26:53.350 --> 26:56.092
at U.S. ports of entry
in 2017 versus

26:56.136 --> 26:57.659
2.4 million pounds in 2013

26:57.703 --> 27:01.271
and 4.3 million
pounds in 2009.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.534
Okay.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.015
What does this have to do
with me sponsoring a bill

27:06.059 --> 27:07.277
to pressure the governor?

27:07.321 --> 27:09.366
Well...You can sponsor two bills.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.325
Be the maverick who
reaches across the aisle

27:11.368 --> 27:12.500
with a humane solution

27:12.543 --> 27:13.719
to family separation

27:13.762 --> 27:16.069
and a creative solution

27:16.112 --> 27:17.897
to get tough on immigration.

27:17.940 --> 27:20.421
Hold your base
and expand it to a broader demo.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.815
WIN: Not only that.
The marijuana lobby is

27:22.858 --> 27:25.339
incredibly well-funded. Um,
one of my biggest initiatives

27:25.382 --> 27:27.167
as their chief lobbyist
is to figure out

27:27.210 --> 27:29.082
where best to invest
those funds.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.084
You have a tough reelection
coming up next cycle, Senator...Win, enough.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.259
...and I'd like to...Win, Win.

27:32.302 --> 27:34.304
Okay.So what do you say,

27:34.348 --> 27:36.263
Senator?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.582
I speak English.

27:51.626 --> 27:52.671
You don't have
to treat me

27:52.714 --> 27:53.976
like a peasant.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.978
Okay. Well, I don't...

27:56.022 --> 27:58.067
[chuckles] I mean,
I don't look at it that way.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.678
I'm just proud of both
my languages and cultures.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.505
This is your culture now,
how you go around in the world.

28:01.549 --> 28:03.420
I was talking
about the Irish side.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.771
Your mother--
always so wild.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.642
How could you turn
out any other way?

28:07.686 --> 28:08.774
[chuckles]:
What are you talking about?

28:08.817 --> 28:11.037
She wanted me
to go to cotillion.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.344
Yeah, I'm not the progeny
either of you had in mind.

28:14.388 --> 28:15.911
How is she?

28:15.955 --> 28:17.130
Still in Florida.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.566
Doing community theater.[chuckles]

28:18.609 --> 28:19.915
Probably happy.She always thought

28:19.959 --> 28:21.612
she was a star.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.919
Too good for me and this place.

28:23.963 --> 28:25.268
That, you got from her.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.096
Moving all over.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.358
Washington,

28:28.402 --> 28:30.578
California, politics,
avocados...Hey.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.928
Okay. Right. Right....writing a book,
airing out

28:32.972 --> 28:34.625
all your dirty laundry.My laundry's

28:34.669 --> 28:35.757
pretty clean,
actually, so...

28:35.801 --> 28:36.758
Telling the world

28:36.802 --> 28:38.107
who you want to sleep with.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.456
Yeah. Yeah.You like girls,

28:39.500 --> 28:41.110
you like boys.Yeah.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.156
What is your daughter
supposed to think?

28:43.199 --> 28:44.505
Desi's fine, by the way.
Thank you for asking.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.116
No.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.379
I'm not doing this.
It's not why I'm here.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.163
[clears throat]

28:50.206 --> 28:52.731
Look, I am here...

28:54.123 --> 28:56.256
Come on.
You've seen the news.

28:56.299 --> 28:58.824
Things aren't good here.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.434
And I'm just--
I'm-I'm worried about you.

29:00.477 --> 29:03.176
I have a green card.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.525
I'm legal.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.353
Never have I worked
here illegally.

29:06.396 --> 29:07.789
I know.
And there was

29:07.833 --> 29:10.096
a time when that
would've been enough. But...

29:10.139 --> 29:12.707
you know what, these days,
I'm not so sure.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.491
I would feel better
if you had citizenship.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.972
I brought the forms.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.670
I filled them all out.
All you have to do is, um,

29:19.714 --> 29:21.977
sign and initial
a couple places

29:22.021 --> 29:24.806
and then send them in, okay?

29:24.850 --> 29:27.896
Once you're in the system,
you're more protected.

29:27.940 --> 29:28.984
[sighs]

29:29.028 --> 29:31.247
Okay?

29:31.291 --> 29:33.597
Tell me you'll do it.

29:33.641 --> 29:36.122
Tell me
you'll do it.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.315
[sighs]
You know what,

29:55.358 --> 29:57.578
I was born this way.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.885
But I was also raised
by a father

29:59.928 --> 30:02.931
who encouraged me
to live my life on my own terms.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.890
And that's exactly what
I'm doing.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.550
[lock buzzes, door closes]

30:13.594 --> 30:14.725
HENRY:
Babe?

30:14.769 --> 30:16.249
You in there?

30:16.292 --> 30:18.338
Oh, my God.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.470
Yes. Oh, I am

30:20.514 --> 30:22.864
so happy to see you. Hi.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.823
Hi, hi, hi.Hi. Hi. That's quite a...

30:24.866 --> 30:26.041
setup. How are
you holding up?

30:26.085 --> 30:27.826
I'm okay, I'm okay.Yeah?

30:27.869 --> 30:29.871
Um, I just got
some news that,

30:29.915 --> 30:32.700
uh, Morejon has agreed
to sponsor the bill

30:32.743 --> 30:34.615
putting pressure
on Arizona to end

30:34.658 --> 30:36.835
the family separation policy.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.924
So they're fast-tracking it
to the floor,

30:38.967 --> 30:41.361
and it looks like
they'll have enough votes.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.102
That's incredible. How
did you pull that off?Yeah.

30:43.145 --> 30:46.453
Jay and a very passionate
pot lobbyist,

30:46.496 --> 30:48.107
who actually caused

30:48.150 --> 30:50.587
Jay's basketball injury trying
to get a sit-down with me.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.459
And do you really want me
to keep talking about this?Nope.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.243
No. I just-- I'm
glad it worked out.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.986
Yeah, well, it's not
entirely worked out though.

30:58.030 --> 31:01.424
Barker is threatening
to fight the bill in court

31:01.468 --> 31:04.427
as an unconstitutional violation
of the commandeering doctrine

31:04.471 --> 31:05.951
under the Tenth Amendment.

31:05.994 --> 31:09.302
So, we may lose support
from senators afraid

31:09.345 --> 31:11.391
of triggering
a constitutional crisis.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.914
Well, don't go there yet.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.961
Barker might just be posturing.[chuckles]:
Yeah.

31:16.004 --> 31:19.747
Well, he-he's got
pretty good follow-through, too.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.749
You know?
[chuckles]
Yeah.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.707
You realize we're not
gonna get back in time

31:23.751 --> 31:25.013
for the vow renewal.

31:25.057 --> 31:27.842
I know.
And I'm so sorry, Henry.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.322
And I promise
I'm gonna make it up to...

31:29.365 --> 31:30.584
I'm way ahead of you.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.368
Since we can't be in D.C.,

31:32.412 --> 31:34.370
I brought D.C. to us.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.895
[whistles]

31:36.938 --> 31:39.071
Surprise!Surprise!
ELIZABETH: Oh!

31:39.114 --> 31:41.334
Oh, my! Hi! Hi, hi.STEVIE:
Have wedding party,

31:41.377 --> 31:42.988
will travel!Better make it quick though.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.685
We got two more gigs
after this one, so...

31:44.728 --> 31:46.861
Are you okay?Oh, yeah. I'm okay. I'm fine.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.471
Hi.Hi, my sweetie.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.865
I brought you
your dream dress.

31:50.909 --> 31:51.997
What?

31:52.040 --> 31:54.608
With the perfect shoes.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.262
And the perfect jewelry.[gasps]
Let me see.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.307
And I am right.

31:58.351 --> 31:59.918
[laughing]

31:59.961 --> 32:02.137
And Father Dinardo?

32:02.181 --> 32:03.965
Oh, yeah. You mentioned
you, uh, got arraigned

32:04.009 --> 32:05.749
with this really cool priest,
so I tracked him down.

32:05.793 --> 32:06.881
He's gonna officiate.

32:06.925 --> 32:07.882
I'm happy to oblige.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.231
I have a feeling you two

32:09.275 --> 32:11.494
are gonna make it.[chuckling]

32:11.538 --> 32:13.583
Eh...Oh, I don't even know
what to say.

32:13.627 --> 32:15.672
This is just so...

32:15.716 --> 32:17.979
this is amazing.

32:18.023 --> 32:21.156
Oh, Henry,
this isn't exactly your...

32:21.200 --> 32:23.419
dream church wedding.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.508
We're here because you're trying
to keep families together.

32:25.552 --> 32:28.294
I can't imagine anything
more holy than that.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.948
So, come on. Let's
get you dressed.Okay.

32:29.991 --> 32:30.992
Okay, okay, okay, okay.We're on the clock.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.472
8:22 approaches!

32:43.004 --> 32:45.354
Wow. Whew.[gasps] Mom.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.313
Do you like it?

32:47.356 --> 32:48.314
I love it.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.837
Oh, gosh.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.578
Ali, you nailed it.

32:51.621 --> 32:54.929
Oh! And look at you, 007.

32:54.973 --> 32:55.930
[chuckles]

32:55.974 --> 32:58.541
Ooh, one final touch.Oh.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.891
STEVIE: Oh, yeah. Don't forget.JASON: Yeah, we put a file
in there, so just, you know...

33:00.935 --> 33:02.850
Everybody scrunch together
for the Godfathershot.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.026
Mike, I said...You said no publicity.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.245
But this is a wedding photo.

33:06.288 --> 33:07.681
Don't you want
to capture the moment?

33:07.724 --> 33:09.291
Babe, he's got a point.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.727
Okay, okay, but just...We just have...

33:10.771 --> 33:13.469
Oh, this is
for personal use only.Absolutely.

33:13.513 --> 33:14.731
We can decide later.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.559
Okay, make it work.
Make it like it's art.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.474
Between the bars. Okay.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.694
Smile. Okay,
not so much teeth.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.696
There you go.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.350
That's perfect.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.047
There it is. Get that one.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.875
Right there.Okay, come on, come on.
We got to get started.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.399
ELIZABETH: Okay.Brothers and sisters,

33:30.443 --> 33:32.010
we are gathered here
today to celebrate

33:32.053 --> 33:33.924
a renewal of love
and commitment

33:33.968 --> 33:37.319
that was first realized
30 years ago today.

33:37.363 --> 33:40.322
I understand Henry and Elizabeth
have prepared their own vows

33:40.366 --> 33:42.324
for the renewal
of their marriage.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.718
[whispering]:
Crap.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.112
You go first.All right.

33:47.155 --> 33:50.941
Um, these aren't really
traditional vows.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.465
It's a letter I found
in the basement

33:52.508 --> 33:54.249
when I was cleaning it out
after the flood.

33:54.293 --> 33:57.252
I wrote it

33:57.296 --> 33:58.601
the night
before we were married.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.910
"Dear Elabet..."

34:02.953 --> 34:05.565
[laughs]That's an inside
joke, so just...

34:05.608 --> 34:07.480
"Tomorrow is the day

34:07.523 --> 34:09.395
"that we begin
our magical mystery tour,

34:09.438 --> 34:11.397
and I've never been
more eager to embark."[all laugh]

34:11.440 --> 34:13.225
I was 26.
Give me a break.

34:13.268 --> 34:16.489
Keep going."I know it's not
the easiest way

to worry about,

on Earth that could keep me

that are waiting for us,

mac and cheese dinners...

34:32.548 --> 34:34.159
go crazy shopping
for pillows..."

34:34.202 --> 34:35.508
[whispers]:
You still do that.

"...and hiking
in the Blue Ridge Mountains

and the leaves
are turning..."

34:48.738 --> 34:51.045
Whoa, okay.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.439
I'm gonna have to skip this part
'cause the kids are here.[laughs]

34:53.482 --> 34:56.398
[groans]"These are the moments
I will hold in my mind

"And the images
of the adventures

"The faces of the
children we'll have.

"Two for sure, three
if we're lucky.

"I know you lost
too much family too soon,

"and I'm so happy to be the one
to help you rebuild that.

"On that note,
no more Peter Frampton concerts

"The best is yet to be.

"Yours forever.

Hank."

35:33.087 --> 35:36.177
The best is yet to be.
I remember that.

35:36.221 --> 35:39.615
I love that.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.661
Your dad's the best romantic.

35:41.704 --> 35:43.619
And I was just...

35:43.663 --> 35:46.405
smitten.

35:46.448 --> 35:49.147
And smart enough to fall

35:49.190 --> 35:52.193
for the ridiculously
handsome fighter pilot

35:52.237 --> 35:55.370
who could quote saints and
write letters like that.

35:55.414 --> 35:58.373
Thank you for...

35:58.417 --> 36:01.289
for blinding me with
your love and words

36:01.333 --> 36:03.204
for the last quarter
of a century, Henry.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.728
And thank you for getting me.

36:05.772 --> 36:08.209
For always knowing
what to say.

36:08.253 --> 36:10.777
[chuckles]: And for
telling the best jokes.

36:10.820 --> 36:14.346
And for...

36:14.389 --> 36:16.304
going to see what
that noise was.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.133
And for never hesitating

36:19.177 --> 36:21.266
to go on a wild ride with me.

36:21.309 --> 36:25.835
Going forward, I promise

36:25.879 --> 36:28.882
to always leave just enough
ice cream in the carton,

36:28.925 --> 36:30.231
especially the mocha fudge.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.407
To not yell at the
news in the morning

36:32.451 --> 36:34.104
or stay up too late
watching cooking shows,

36:34.148 --> 36:35.193
unless you want to
watch them with me.

36:35.236 --> 36:38.587
And to always

36:38.631 --> 36:41.199
