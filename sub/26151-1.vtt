00:13.805 --> 00:16.849
Well, hello there.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.392
Who are you?

00:18.393 --> 00:21.270
Based on your vibe, a student.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.814
Your blouse is loose.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.483
You're not here to be ogled,
but those bracelets,

00:26.484 --> 00:28.152
they jangle.

00:28.153 --> 00:31.405
You like a little attention.
Okay, I bite.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.240
You search the books.

00:33.241 --> 00:36.076
Uh, fiction. F through K.

00:36.077 --> 00:39.208
Now, hmm, you're not
the standard insecure nymph

00:39.209 --> 00:42.583
hunting for Faulkner you'll never finish.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.793
Too sun-kissed for Stephen King.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.520
Who will you buy?

00:47.521 --> 00:49.313
Sorry.

00:49.314 --> 00:51.482
You sound apologetic,

00:51.483 --> 00:54.151
like you're embarrassed
to be a good girl.

00:54.152 --> 00:57.364
And you murmur your first word to me.

00:58.657 --> 01:00.449
Hello.

01:00.450 --> 01:02.159
Do you work here?

01:02.160 --> 01:03.786
Guilty.

01:03.787 --> 01:05.078
Can I help you find something?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.497
Paula Fox?

01:06.498 --> 01:07.873
That's a good choice.

01:07.874 --> 01:09.708
Hmm, I feel weirdly validated.

01:11.044 --> 01:12.170
Follow me.

01:15.924 --> 01:17.591
She's gonna be in here.

01:17.592 --> 01:19.218
Celebrity authors.

01:19.219 --> 01:20.886
I thought Fox was pretty obscure.

01:20.887 --> 01:24.223
She is Courtney Love's
maternal grandmother.

01:24.224 --> 01:25.558
You're not expected to know that.

01:25.559 --> 01:27.309
Good, I didn't.

01:27.310 --> 01:29.061
Mr. Mooney wants anyone in here

01:29.062 --> 01:30.479
who's even tangentially famous.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.897
He thinks it sells more books.

01:31.898 --> 01:33.774
That's sad... people buying books

01:33.775 --> 01:35.776
because of what's popular,
not because they want to be

01:35.777 --> 01:38.988
moved or changed in some way.

01:38.989 --> 01:41.532
Yeah. It's an epidemic.

01:41.533 --> 01:42.700
Hmm.

01:42.701 --> 01:44.076
Yeah, you see this guy,

01:44.077 --> 01:46.120
here with the glasses, behind you?

01:46.121 --> 01:49.498
He just grabbed Dan Brown's
latest on the way in.

01:49.499 --> 01:51.959
So he's gonna wander around
for another, like,

01:51.960 --> 01:53.961
five or ten minutes just
to find something legitimate

01:53.962 --> 01:55.170
to buy with it.

01:55.171 --> 01:56.505
Oh, like the cereal guys buy

01:56.506 --> 01:57.881
when they're really there for condoms?

01:57.882 --> 01:59.258
Only makes it more conspicuous.

01:59.259 --> 02:00.968
Like, own your...

02:00.969 --> 02:03.597
If Dan Brown's your kink,
then be out about it.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.017
At the end of the day,

02:08.018 --> 02:10.270
people really are
disappointing, aren't they?

02:11.313 --> 02:13.606
Sometimes they surprise you.

02:15.108 --> 02:17.109
Paula Fox, top shelf.
Do you want me to...

02:17.110 --> 02:18.902
Oh, no, I got it.

02:22.115 --> 02:24.908
Oh, are you not wearing a bra?

02:24.909 --> 02:26.619
And you want me to notice.

02:26.620 --> 02:28.454
If this was a movie,

02:28.455 --> 02:32.666
I'd grab you and we'd go at it
right in the stacks.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.097
Have you read her fiction?

02:34.098 --> 02:36.253
"Desperate Characters" is her...
it's her best.

02:36.254 --> 02:37.921
Oh, that's what I keep hearing.

02:37.922 --> 02:39.254
You haven't read "Desperate Characters"?

02:39.255 --> 02:40.242
I know. I know.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.134
I'm worried it's not gonna
live up to the hype.

02:42.135 --> 02:43.969
I can safely say it is that good.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.471
That's a high endorsement.

02:45.472 --> 02:47.723
And from a bookstore clerk, nonetheless.

02:47.724 --> 02:49.433
Well, it's bookstore manager.

02:49.434 --> 02:51.603
Hello? Anyone working here?

02:53.772 --> 02:55.189
Oh.

02:55.190 --> 02:57.108
Whoa.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.197
Do you mind? Uh, I'm in a hurry.

03:03.198 --> 03:05.032
He's just... he's gotta buy Salinger

03:05.033 --> 03:06.909
to feel respectable
when all he really wants to do

03:06.910 --> 03:09.286
is eat Cheetos and... it to iPorn

03:09.287 --> 03:13.582
before washing it all down
with a Dan Brown chaser.

03:13.583 --> 03:14.834
Have a nice day, sir.

03:19.005 --> 03:21.173
Okay, I'm going for it.

03:21.174 --> 03:22.675
Good, you won't regret it.

03:22.676 --> 03:23.842
Better not.

03:23.843 --> 03:25.678
Paula Fox, nice.

03:25.679 --> 03:27.346
You know, she was, uh, Courtney Love's

03:27.347 --> 03:28.514
maternal grandmother.

03:28.515 --> 03:29.766
That's why I'm buying it.

03:32.811 --> 03:35.062
You have enough cash to cover this,

03:35.063 --> 03:36.939
but you want me to know your name.

03:36.940 --> 03:38.357
Guinevere?

03:38.358 --> 03:39.858
Yeah, my parents were...

03:39.859 --> 03:41.610
with the whole naming thing.

03:41.611 --> 03:44.165
But everyone just calls me Beck.

03:44.989 --> 03:47.366
And you're Joe?

03:47.367 --> 03:48.753
Goldberg.

03:49.452 --> 03:51.370
Everyone calls me Joe.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.376
Aren't you gonna tell me
to have a nice day?

03:57.377 --> 03:59.420
You have a nice day, Beck.

03:59.421 --> 04:01.255
You have one yourself, Joe.

04:05.135 --> 04:08.303
You smiled, laughed at my jokes,

04:08.304 --> 04:12.224
told me your name, asked for mine.

04:12.225 --> 04:14.101
She write her number on there?

04:14.102 --> 04:16.144
She was on you hard.

04:16.146 --> 04:18.021
No, she was just being nice.

04:18.022 --> 04:19.898
I'd be Googling the hell
out of her right now.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.274
You know her full name.

04:21.276 --> 04:23.235
That's pretty aggressive, Ethan.

04:23.236 --> 04:24.653
What do I tell you?

04:24.654 --> 04:27.407
Always be closing that...

04:28.825 --> 04:30.200
- If you need me...
- If you need me...

04:30.201 --> 04:31.243
I'll be in cookbooks

04:31.244 --> 04:32.578
but for work, not for fun.

04:32.579 --> 04:34.288
I swear.

04:34.289 --> 04:36.123
At the end of the day,

04:36.124 --> 04:38.250
people are really just
disappointing, aren't they?

04:44.674 --> 04:46.592
But are you, Beck?

04:46.593 --> 04:47.968
Are you?

05:05.987 --> 05:09.031
Yes, people find "the one."

05:09.032 --> 05:12.493
I believe that. I try to stay open.

05:12.494 --> 05:13.994
I was in love once.

05:13.995 --> 05:15.954
She broke my heart, Beck.

05:15.955 --> 05:18.832
Oh, she really did a number on me.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.667
I should have seen the signs.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.796
But we never do when we're in love.

05:23.797 --> 05:25.839
Claudia and Ron.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.633
Went out for a couple of drinks.

05:27.634 --> 05:29.510
Get off my back, Claudia.

05:29.511 --> 05:32.012
Claudia's a nurse. Single parent.

05:32.013 --> 05:33.722
- It's every night!
- It's not every night!

05:33.723 --> 05:35.432
You think she knew Ron was a...

05:35.433 --> 05:37.142
when she fell in love?

05:37.143 --> 05:39.353
No, she thought he was a prince.

05:39.354 --> 05:40.771
Hey, Paco.

05:40.772 --> 05:42.606
What's up, Joe?

05:42.607 --> 05:45.317
And now hers is not
the only life she ruined.

05:45.318 --> 05:49.196
Leave me alone!
I don't wanna talk to you!

05:49.197 --> 05:50.572
Is everything cool in there?

05:50.573 --> 05:53.367
Yeah, Mom and Ron are just talking.

05:53.368 --> 05:54.993
No, man, this isn't your house...

05:54.994 --> 05:57.674
Wow, you are burning
through that book, aren't you?

05:58.164 --> 05:59.540
Reads quick.

05:59.541 --> 06:00.999
It's good.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.084
Well, let me know when you finish.

06:02.085 --> 06:03.836
I'll... I'll get you another one.

06:03.837 --> 06:07.100
All right, well, I don't care about that!

06:08.007 --> 06:09.174
Are you hungry?

06:10.844 --> 06:12.511
'Cause, you know, I just got
this meatball sub,

06:12.512 --> 06:14.847
but I remembered I have Thai
from last night.

06:16.558 --> 06:18.892
No, my mom will just
make me something later.

06:18.893 --> 06:20.477
It's a shame. This won't keep.

06:20.478 --> 06:21.864
It's getting tossed.

06:22.564 --> 06:23.950
You sure, Joe?

06:25.900 --> 06:27.861
All for one and one for all.

06:41.175 --> 06:45.879
The point, Beck: love is tricky.

07:04.939 --> 07:07.399
A guy needs to protect himself.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.068
I had to be sure you're safe.

07:10.069 --> 07:13.071
And your name was
a glorious place to start.

07:13.072 --> 07:15.460
Not a lot of Guinevere Becks.

07:15.992 --> 07:17.409
And there you were.

07:17.410 --> 07:19.161
Every account set to public.

07:19.162 --> 07:21.413
You want to be seen...

07:21.414 --> 07:23.707
heard, known.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.512
Of course, I obliged.

07:27.128 --> 07:30.464
Born and raised, Nantucket Island.

07:30.465 --> 07:33.342
A brother, Clyde, and sister, Anya.

07:33.343 --> 07:36.511
Your parents really were
...about the names.

07:36.512 --> 07:38.972
Your folks split when you were 12.

07:38.973 --> 07:41.069
Your dad dropped out of the picture.

07:41.643 --> 07:43.852
Went to Brown, where you
majored in lit, cool.

07:43.853 --> 07:46.146
And minored in ..., mm.

07:46.147 --> 07:48.440
And then on to NYC to conquer an MFA

07:48.441 --> 07:50.108
and make your mark, presumably.

07:50.109 --> 07:52.277
Now, you still write. Barely.

07:52.278 --> 07:53.820
Too busy living out moments
you won't remember

07:53.821 --> 07:55.489
five years from now.

07:55.490 --> 07:57.783
I know this because you
post about this life

07:57.784 --> 07:59.451
all the... time.

08:01.788 --> 08:03.747
Candidly, it's the least appealing thing

08:03.748 --> 08:05.457
about you, Beck.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.543
You posted this
hours after our encounter.

08:08.544 --> 08:10.295
I was concerned.

08:10.296 --> 08:12.130
You didn't mention that
cute guy in the bookstore.

08:12.131 --> 08:14.883
And then I realized,
your online life isn't real.

08:14.884 --> 08:16.802
It's a... it's a collage.

08:16.803 --> 08:18.345
You paste this Beck up...

08:18.346 --> 08:20.764
this, uh, together, lovable, cute,

08:20.765 --> 08:22.557
bendy little creature.

08:22.558 --> 08:24.393
If anything, the fact
that you didn't share me

08:24.394 --> 08:27.396
with your followers only
confirms we really connected.

08:27.397 --> 08:29.731
The next thing our little
friend the Internet gave me

08:29.732 --> 08:31.316
was your address.

08:36.447 --> 08:38.823
There it is, with its big,

08:38.825 --> 08:40.741
naked windows.

08:40.743 --> 08:42.327
It's nice... too nice.

08:42.328 --> 08:45.038
I'm thinking subsidized school housing.

08:45.039 --> 08:47.874
Jesus, it's like you've never
seen a horror movie

08:47.875 --> 08:49.584
or the news.

08:57.135 --> 08:59.678
But you want people to watch, don't you?

08:59.679 --> 09:01.471
You know, I plan on asking you
about this quality

09:01.472 --> 09:03.181
when we get to know each other better.

09:04.624 --> 09:06.518
why don't we spend the day
together tomorrow,

09:06.519 --> 09:07.923
just you and me?

09:07.924 --> 09:09.938
To everyone out there
chasing their dreams,

09:09.939 --> 09:10.939
don't give up.

09:10.940 --> 09:12.190
And in the meantime,

09:12.191 --> 09:14.120
Mac N Cheese!

09:14.819 --> 09:15.902
It's cute.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.030
Not deep, but cute.

09:18.031 --> 09:20.032
Is there more to you?

09:20.033 --> 09:21.533
Let's find out.

09:21.534 --> 09:25.579
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:32.211 --> 09:33.962
Our day starts at the... crack of dawn.

09:33.963 --> 09:35.797
I know from your posted
schedule that you teach

09:35.798 --> 09:38.550
A 6:30 class called Get Up N Flow.

09:38.551 --> 09:41.219
You caress the sweaty backs of bulimic,

09:41.220 --> 09:43.305
dead-eyed Real Mommies of Soho...

09:43.306 --> 09:45.766
I am loving your form today, Tasha.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.185
Offering smiles
and lies of encouragement.

09:49.979 --> 09:53.106
By 10:00, you're at campus
to TA a romantics class

09:53.107 --> 09:55.233
and play Vanna White to some shirt.

09:55.234 --> 09:56.943
Good morning, Professor Leahy.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.820
I told you, it's Paul.

09:58.821 --> 10:00.489
Are you ready for class?

10:00.490 --> 10:02.449
Professor Obvious wants to... you.

10:02.450 --> 10:04.076
But you're smart.

10:04.077 --> 10:05.994
You... you let him think
one day, he might.

10:05.995 --> 10:07.412
And what's the harm in that, right?

10:09.165 --> 10:11.958
After class, you head
to your favorite cafe

10:11.959 --> 10:14.628
to write for the first time all day.

10:14.629 --> 10:17.099
But your life doesn't cooperate.

10:18.466 --> 10:20.717
Your wealthy girlfriends
have just now woken up

10:20.718 --> 10:23.053
and have nothing better to do
than plan their next

10:23.054 --> 10:25.514
pointless yet Instagrammable night.

10:25.515 --> 10:27.390
Can we get real for a second?

10:27.391 --> 10:28.850
You have questionable taste
in friends, Beck...

10:34.982 --> 10:36.942
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

10:36.943 --> 10:39.945
Oh, yes, happy birthday!

10:41.447 --> 10:43.949
And expensive taste in lives.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.795
- Ready?
- Thank you.

10:47.453 --> 10:49.246
Do you like it?

10:49.247 --> 10:50.831
No, I hate it.

10:50.832 --> 10:52.541
Of course I love it!

10:52.542 --> 10:54.084
Jason didn't even get her
something that nice,

10:54.085 --> 10:56.002
and Annika finally let him do...

10:58.631 --> 10:59.965
Please.

10:59.966 --> 11:01.174
Open my gift next and tell me

11:01.175 --> 11:02.676
how much you hate me then, lady.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.432
A butterfly?

11:09.433 --> 11:10.725
It's my spirit animal for the year.

11:10.726 --> 11:12.310
You remembered?

11:12.311 --> 11:13.937
Only 'cause you wouldn't
shut up about it.

11:13.938 --> 11:16.356
You want so badly to be one of them.

11:16.357 --> 11:18.024
- Happy birthday.
- You guys are so beautiful.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.401
They've got nothing to do after this,

11:19.402 --> 11:20.861
so yeah, they'll party till 5:00

11:20.862 --> 11:22.654
and scrape it together tomorrow.

11:22.655 --> 11:24.948
But you can't.
You have to work for a living.

11:24.949 --> 11:27.367
A McQueen, Beck?

11:27.368 --> 11:28.577
How much was it?

11:28.578 --> 11:30.162
It was on clearance.

11:30.163 --> 11:31.955
They haven't put
a McQueen scarf on clearance

11:31.956 --> 11:33.999
since he hung himself in 2010.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.001
It'd be too much
even if she did deserve it,

11:36.002 --> 11:37.919
which she does not.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.213
Hmm, not all your friends are dumb.

11:40.214 --> 11:41.756
You always do this.

11:41.757 --> 11:44.426
You make, like, a big gesture
that you can't afford

11:44.427 --> 11:47.053
because, I'm sorry, you're too nice.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.221
It's no big deal.

11:48.222 --> 11:50.776
I had, um, a gift card.

11:51.517 --> 11:52.977
How broke are you?

11:55.021 --> 11:56.730
Just tell me what's up.

11:56.731 --> 11:59.024
Actually sounds like she cares.

11:59.025 --> 12:00.692
Look, I appreciate...

12:00.693 --> 12:03.153
Why don't you just let me
loan you some cash, okay?

12:03.154 --> 12:04.905
I keep telling you it's nothing.

12:04.906 --> 12:06.531
Also sounds condescending.

12:06.532 --> 12:08.544
You know I'd do anything for you.

12:09.535 --> 12:11.297
Don't forget that.

12:12.455 --> 12:14.372
Sure you can't come out with us?

12:14.373 --> 12:15.540
I gotta write.

12:15.541 --> 12:17.417
Virtuous. Catch you later.

12:22.381 --> 12:24.966
Is that the best friend you've got?

12:24.967 --> 12:28.553
If so, Beck, you really are alone.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.565
Your social media's a liar.

12:40.566 --> 12:44.277
It says you're
a happy-go-lucky dilettante.

12:44.278 --> 12:47.822
But underneath it all, you seem like

12:47.823 --> 12:49.407
the genuine article.

12:49.408 --> 12:50.909
Stretched ADD thin, sure,

12:50.910 --> 12:52.452
but as soon as the door closes,

12:52.453 --> 12:54.079
you're back at the keyboard,

12:54.080 --> 12:55.248
trying to write.

13:15.017 --> 13:16.434
Thanks.

13:19.355 --> 13:20.772
Keep the change, man.

13:24.068 --> 13:26.152
Hey, let me up.

13:26.153 --> 13:30.251
Uh, Beck, who the... is this?

13:38.916 --> 13:40.667
My best friend walked in
on you getting your dick sucked

13:40.668 --> 13:42.460
by some random woman in a bathroom

13:42.461 --> 13:44.963
at a party that I took you to.

13:44.964 --> 13:47.007
I was wasted. I didn't even finish.

13:47.008 --> 13:48.633
That's your apology? "I didn't ...?"

13:48.634 --> 13:50.468
That's the one you're going with?

13:50.469 --> 13:51.928
And I obviously shouldn't
have gone in the bathroom

13:51.929 --> 13:53.305
with any girl that wasn't you.

13:53.306 --> 13:54.639
But she said she had good coke,

13:54.640 --> 13:56.600
and I've been seriously stressed.

13:58.144 --> 14:00.145
I thought when Johno and I
started our line,

14:00.146 --> 14:01.855
it was gonna be, like,
picking out flavors and...

14:01.856 --> 14:03.481
It turns out it's 16-hour lectures

14:03.482 --> 14:04.816
on microbial management.

14:04.817 --> 14:06.568
And that's why no one starts their own

14:06.569 --> 14:08.570
artisanal soda company
and why America has to keep

14:08.571 --> 14:10.530
drinking crap that's giving them cancer.

14:10.531 --> 14:12.991
You actually managed to
connect your illicit blow job

14:12.992 --> 14:15.285
to curing cancer.

14:15.286 --> 14:17.371
I'm genuinely impressed.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.208
Beck, I...

14:22.209 --> 14:25.545
Seriously, I am drowning in work.

14:25.546 --> 14:27.672
I don't have time to keep hooking up

14:27.673 --> 14:30.050
or whatever it is you're even capable of.

14:30.051 --> 14:32.980
I know I've done some stupid...

14:33.512 --> 14:34.930
But I'm on it now.

14:36.349 --> 14:40.311
I don't wanna be just some guy
that you sleep with.

14:43.189 --> 14:45.648
God, you make me insane.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.324
Way to go, Beck. Looks like a catch.

14:57.745 --> 15:00.121
Benjamin J. Ashby III.
Oh, there's three of them.

15:00.122 --> 15:01.998
Greenwich born, boarding school bred.

15:01.999 --> 15:05.377
His father is the Ben Ashby
of Ashby Brokerage.

15:05.378 --> 15:07.003
Two failed careers.

15:07.004 --> 15:08.213
Model... oh, boy.

15:08.214 --> 15:09.881
And cocreator of a dating app

15:09.882 --> 15:11.508
that connects people
through musical tastes

15:11.509 --> 15:13.343
called LoveHooks.

15:13.344 --> 15:16.054
Current CEO of Home Soda
Artisanal Beverages.

15:16.055 --> 15:18.348
Drink Better by Hand,

15:18.349 --> 15:20.558
which makes no sense
but evokes a homespun quality

15:20.559 --> 15:24.062
that lines up with a guy who
wears $600 Japanese sneakers.

15:24.063 --> 15:25.522
The hair.

15:25.523 --> 15:27.399
The privilege he tries to hide

15:27.400 --> 15:29.567
with retweets of Black Lives Matter.

15:29.568 --> 15:31.403
Not to sound judgy, but this guy

15:31.404 --> 15:33.947
is everything wrong with America.

15:36.075 --> 15:37.909
See, this is why I do my research.

15:37.910 --> 15:40.286
You fall for the wrong men...

15:40.287 --> 15:41.496
bad men.

15:41.497 --> 15:42.831
You let them in.

15:42.832 --> 15:44.082
You let them hurt you.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.792
Too far away to know for sure,

15:45.793 --> 15:47.585
but my guess is,
if he came anywhere close

15:47.586 --> 15:48.878
to making you come, you'd have made

15:48.879 --> 15:50.547
a Broadway show out of it.

15:50.548 --> 15:51.923
But you didn't...

15:51.924 --> 15:52.924
'cause he didn't.

15:58.431 --> 15:59.764
"Desperate Characters"?

15:59.765 --> 16:01.266
Yeah, I just got it.

16:01.267 --> 16:02.725
You can borrow it when I'm done.

16:02.726 --> 16:03.977
It's supposed to be her best.

16:03.978 --> 16:05.218
Johno's consultant we brought in,

16:05.219 --> 16:06.980
she's been all over me
about this kind of thing.

16:06.981 --> 16:09.201
Saged the crap out of the office.

16:09.608 --> 16:12.068
The book title has the word
"desperate" in it.

16:12.069 --> 16:13.445
You don't wanna think of yourself

16:13.446 --> 16:15.239
as a desperate character, Beck.

16:17.241 --> 16:19.951
'Cause you're the opposite, babe.

16:19.952 --> 16:22.715
You're the smartest girl I know.

16:23.581 --> 16:25.957
Honestly, you blow me away.

16:30.713 --> 16:32.255
Oh... Gotta roll.

16:32.256 --> 16:33.798
Johno's blowing up my phone.

16:33.799 --> 16:36.009
Hey, you should come by the office,

16:36.010 --> 16:37.427
test out some new flavors.

16:37.428 --> 16:38.597
We're doing cumin.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.138
I know how much you like Indian food.

16:40.139 --> 16:42.640
Sure. Sounds good.

16:42.641 --> 16:45.101
Looks good on you, by the way.

16:46.604 --> 16:48.521
The extra weight.

16:51.317 --> 16:53.693
Yeah, hey, I'm on my way, bro.

16:53.694 --> 16:55.487
You guys ordering pizzas?

16:55.488 --> 16:56.779
Yeah, don't... me over like last time.

16:56.780 --> 16:57.780
Gluten-free crust.

16:57.781 --> 16:59.157
Not from that vegan place.

16:59.158 --> 17:00.867
Vegan cheese tastes like...

17:11.086 --> 17:13.171
I'm talking French gourmet...

17:14.423 --> 17:17.008
No, Johno, Johno, listen to me.

17:17.009 --> 17:19.511
They can't do half gluten-free
'cause of the dough.

17:19.512 --> 17:21.304
They have to use a spelt dough.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.167
So you didn't finish.

18:24.618 --> 18:27.870
Just like that.

18:36.505 --> 18:38.423
Here.

18:38.424 --> 18:40.717
Oh, thank you.

18:40.718 --> 18:42.635
You're so kind.

18:42.636 --> 18:45.722
I don't suppose you can help me
get a cab, can you?

18:45.723 --> 18:46.889
Of course.

18:46.890 --> 18:48.224
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

19:06.952 --> 19:09.954
Wow, don't tell me
you're finished already.

19:09.955 --> 19:11.289
Almost.

19:11.290 --> 19:13.082
It's so good.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.792
Sometimes the dialogue's weird, though,

19:14.793 --> 19:16.336
like when they're killing each other

19:16.337 --> 19:17.629
and still all nice about it.

19:17.630 --> 19:18.963
Well, it was the 19th century.

19:18.964 --> 19:20.591
People still had manners.

19:22.009 --> 19:24.219
I was hoping we could go get another one.

19:25.888 --> 19:27.597
Ooh, I mean, it's pretty late, Pac.

19:27.598 --> 19:29.307
I don't know.

19:29.308 --> 19:32.310
Oh, yeah. Oh, I want you to...

19:32.311 --> 19:34.187
Ugh, something's
in the air tonight, Beck,

19:34.188 --> 19:37.982
'cause everyone but me is getting action.

19:37.983 --> 19:39.734
Even the lovebirds made up.

19:39.735 --> 19:42.111
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

19:43.989 --> 19:46.157
Did you know Dumas was a black dude?

19:46.158 --> 19:47.200
I Googled him.

19:47.201 --> 19:48.576
His grandmother was a slave,

19:48.577 --> 19:50.495
and his dad was a brigadier general.

19:50.496 --> 19:52.341
He killed, like, half a battalion.

19:53.123 --> 19:55.958
You probably knew that
since you work at a bookstore.

19:55.959 --> 19:57.377
I didn't.

19:57.378 --> 19:58.419
How'd you get to work here, anyway?

19:58.420 --> 19:59.716
Mr. Mooney gave me a job

19:59.717 --> 20:02.006
when I was just a little older than you.
He sort of took me in.

20:02.007 --> 20:03.341
He seems nice.

20:03.342 --> 20:06.511
He was a dick. But he loved books.

20:06.512 --> 20:07.970
And he taught me to love them too.

20:07.971 --> 20:10.014
I never see him around here.

20:10.015 --> 20:11.224
Is he dead?

20:11.225 --> 20:12.600
No, he's just old.

20:12.601 --> 20:14.352
I'm sorry, Pac.

20:14.353 --> 20:15.436
I had one back here for you,

20:15.437 --> 20:16.646
but Ethan must have sold it.

20:16.647 --> 20:17.647
Sold what?

20:17.648 --> 20:19.357
Your next read.

20:19.358 --> 20:20.817
Come on, I'll show you
where we keep the good stuff.

20:37.334 --> 20:38.376
Freaky.

20:44.049 --> 20:45.727
It's the cage.

20:46.385 --> 20:48.886
It's where we keep early
editions and collectibles.

20:48.887 --> 20:49.942
It's cold.

20:49.943 --> 20:52.223
65 degrees for the books.

20:52.224 --> 20:55.195
If the zombies come,
this is where I'm hiding.

20:55.894 --> 20:57.872
Why don't you set that milk shake down?

21:17.958 --> 21:19.792
Careful, Joseph.

21:19.793 --> 21:21.753
When it comes to the value of a book,

21:21.754 --> 21:23.713
it's all about condition.

21:23.714 --> 21:24.829
I'll show you.

21:24.830 --> 21:27.425
It's always 65 degrees, humidity 40%.

21:27.426 --> 21:30.636
Too moist, the pages can mildew.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.430
Too dry, they get brittle.

21:32.431 --> 21:35.933
Always keep books upright
so the spines don't become

21:35.934 --> 21:38.311
rolled or warped or what we call cocked.

21:38.312 --> 21:40.938
And we never want
to fold or crease the pages.

21:40.939 --> 21:43.900
And we dust the covers
with a chemical-free duster.

21:43.901 --> 21:45.818
Always towards the spine.

21:45.819 --> 21:47.779
Under no circumstances
is there any sunlight

21:47.780 --> 21:49.280
in this room.

21:49.281 --> 21:51.783
Sunlight can ruin a book as fast as fire.

21:51.784 --> 21:53.159
Faster.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.660
It's a lot of stuff to remember

21:54.661 --> 21:56.829
just to take care of some old books.

21:56.830 --> 21:59.499
The most valuable things in life

21:59.500 --> 22:03.128
are usually the most helpless.

22:04.505 --> 22:07.799
So they need people like us
to protect them.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.884
You know?

22:14.765 --> 22:16.307
"Don Quicks-oat"?

22:16.308 --> 22:17.725
"Quixote."

22:17.726 --> 22:19.268
It's about a guy
who believes in chivalry,

22:19.269 --> 22:20.937
so he decides to be an old-school knight.

22:20.938 --> 22:22.313
What's chivalry?

22:22.314 --> 22:24.398
It's treating people with
respect, especially women...

22:24.399 --> 22:26.108
like men should.

22:26.109 --> 22:28.152
It's good. It's one of my favorites.

22:28.153 --> 22:29.987
I probably shouldn't take this home.

22:29.988 --> 22:31.489
It's not a first edition.
It's just an old one.

22:31.490 --> 22:33.282
Besides, I trust you.

22:50.759 --> 22:52.009
Where you been, Paco?

22:52.010 --> 22:53.469
We just grabbed some milk shakes.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.179
You just walk off with strangers?

22:55.180 --> 22:56.973
Joe's not a stranger.

22:56.974 --> 22:59.517
Yes, he is. Inside, now.

22:59.518 --> 23:01.395
Okay? All right.

23:08.610 --> 23:09.902
Keep away from my girlfriend's kid.

23:09.903 --> 23:11.265
Look, I'm sorry.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.990
But he was out here and he
could hear everything in there.

23:13.991 --> 23:15.794
Don't you tell me how to parent.

23:16.368 --> 23:18.621
Look, this whole nice-guy act,
this might work on other people.

23:18.622 --> 23:21.414
I'm a parole officer 15 years,
and I can see what you are.

23:21.415 --> 23:23.988
Well, you're an alcoholic
...who beats women,

23:23.989 --> 23:26.168
so, please, enlighten me.

23:27.588 --> 23:29.099
You're a freak.

23:30.048 --> 23:31.257
So stay away from Paco,
because if you don't,

23:31.258 --> 23:32.758
I'm gonna grab a steak knife

23:32.759 --> 23:33.926
and I'm gonna cut those freak eyes out.

23:36.388 --> 23:38.681
There are scary people
in the world, Beck.

23:38.682 --> 23:40.391
That's why it's important to be safe.

23:45.898 --> 23:48.901
And why I have to do
what I'm about to do.

23:55.908 --> 23:58.910
Did you know the law

23:58.911 --> 24:01.454
requires gas leaks to be investigated?

24:01.455 --> 24:03.122
I've been learning a lot since I met you.

24:03.123 --> 24:05.302
Hey, Beck, you left the door open again.

24:05.303 --> 24:07.335
I thought we said we weren't
gonna do that anymore.

24:07.336 --> 24:09.086
I was careful to call the gas company

24:09.087 --> 24:10.588
on a day when you had a full schedule.

24:10.589 --> 24:11.881
Wouldn't want to scare you.

24:11.882 --> 24:13.758
Hey, is Beck here?

24:13.759 --> 24:16.218
Nope, super let me in.
Someone reported a leak.

24:16.219 --> 24:18.179
Right, yeah, she mentioned that.
Is everything okay?

24:18.180 --> 24:19.430
Yeah, all clear.

24:19.431 --> 24:20.932
Tell your girlfriend there's no leak.

24:20.933 --> 24:22.433
I'm done, so...

24:22.434 --> 24:25.072
Okay, thanks. Well, I can just lock up.

24:29.232 --> 24:31.692
I just need to know who you really are,

24:31.693 --> 24:35.112
besides a broke poetry student
in a subsidized apartment

24:35.113 --> 24:36.906
you could never afford.

24:36.907 --> 24:39.116
Where is it, Beck?

24:39.117 --> 24:41.619
When we live together,
your place won't be a pigsty.

24:41.620 --> 24:43.423
I'll clean for us.

24:44.122 --> 24:45.790
And you won't eat all this frozen...

24:45.791 --> 24:47.792
I'll cook for you every day.

24:47.793 --> 24:48.918
I promise.

24:54.633 --> 24:56.133
I'll even do your laundry...

24:58.470 --> 25:00.304
And take care of your favorite books.

25:02.975 --> 25:05.862
I'll make our bed every morning.

25:06.144 --> 25:08.437
Oh, there it is.

25:08.438 --> 25:10.159
No matter how hard you fight me,

25:10.160 --> 25:13.943
I will always make sure you
password protect your devices.

25:18.365 --> 25:20.585
"One day, you won't need love anymore.

25:21.159 --> 25:23.244
"One day, you won't
walk through the world

25:23.245 --> 25:25.788
"as though it was your job
to hold everything up.

25:25.789 --> 25:30.292
The sun, the sky,
the hard part of the night."

25:30.293 --> 25:32.013
It's good.

25:32.713 --> 25:34.266
It's quite good.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.382
But, Beck, where's the rest?

25:36.383 --> 25:38.385
You owe me 20 more pages.

25:39.302 --> 25:42.513
I've been honestly working
every day and grading papers.

25:42.514 --> 25:44.181
If the schedule is too rigorous,

25:44.182 --> 25:45.349
drop back to part-time.

25:45.350 --> 25:46.851
But then I won't qualify to TA.

25:46.852 --> 25:49.228
I-I need the cash, the housing.
I'd lose my place.

25:49.229 --> 25:50.646
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

25:50.647 --> 25:52.023
You're smart, or you wouldn't be here.

25:52.024 --> 25:53.994
- Please, Professor Leahy...
- Paul.

25:54.651 --> 25:56.277
Paul.

25:56.278 --> 25:57.987
I'll get you the pages
by the end of the week.

25:57.988 --> 26:00.698
I-I can't go to part-time.

26:00.699 --> 26:01.908
Okay?

26:04.703 --> 26:06.871
I'm rooting for you.

26:06.872 --> 26:09.457
You just need to keep up.

26:09.458 --> 26:11.417
Happy to discuss further,

26:11.418 --> 26:13.377
after class some evening.

26:13.378 --> 26:14.920
If we're gonna seriously discuss poetry,

26:14.921 --> 26:15.890
it should be over a drink.

26:15.891 --> 26:17.976
There's a little gastropub I love.

26:18.592 --> 26:20.676
I would love that, Paul.

26:20.677 --> 26:23.846
Just, uh, how would your wife
feel about you...

26:23.847 --> 26:25.848
About me helping out an aspiring writer?

26:25.849 --> 26:28.851
She's... she's used to my generosity.

26:30.103 --> 26:31.520
So Thursday night, then?

26:33.565 --> 26:35.399
Thursday night it is.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.901
Excellent.

26:36.902 --> 26:38.194
And don't worry about the next few days.

26:38.195 --> 26:40.863
Just go home and get caught up.

26:51.374 --> 26:53.626
Need to see you tonight.

26:56.588 --> 26:59.381
Well, if I can, babe. Working late.

26:59.382 --> 27:02.103
PS, I can still smell you ...

27:02.761 --> 27:04.470
I learned two definitive things

27:04.471 --> 27:06.305
by scouring your computer.

27:06.306 --> 27:08.599
First, there are no
recent pictures of your dad

27:08.600 --> 27:10.434
because he's dead.

27:10.435 --> 27:13.104
He OD'd, and you were
the one that found him.

27:13.105 --> 27:15.397
You've started a few poems
about that day,

27:15.398 --> 27:17.066
but you never finish them.

27:17.067 --> 27:19.110
I'm so sorry, Beck.

27:19.111 --> 27:21.320
But none of this matters
because of my second

27:21.321 --> 27:23.322
and greatest discovery.

27:23.323 --> 27:26.450
11:06 a.m., an hour after
our encounter at the bookstore,

27:26.451 --> 27:28.077
amidst a group text on the merits

27:28.078 --> 27:31.038
of, uh, vaginal detoxing, you wrote...

27:31.039 --> 27:34.625
Wow. Just met a human male
who actually reads.

27:34.626 --> 27:36.252
Alert the media.

27:36.253 --> 27:37.711
What if it's finally time for me

27:37.712 --> 27:39.255
to date someone good for me?

27:39.256 --> 27:40.923
Thank you for letting me know

27:40.924 --> 27:42.258
I wasn't crazy after all.

27:42.259 --> 27:43.634
No!

27:43.635 --> 27:44.802
Yes.

27:44.803 --> 27:45.970
I remember what you said

27:45.971 --> 27:48.180
when you sent money last.

27:48.181 --> 27:50.099
Yes, I'm grateful.

27:51.518 --> 27:53.644
I'm working constantly.

27:53.645 --> 27:56.324
There's no place cheaper to live.

27:56.857 --> 27:58.274
I did.

27:58.275 --> 28:01.986
He basically offered to sleep with me.

28:01.987 --> 28:03.988
No, I can't report him.
That's not how it works.

28:03.989 --> 28:05.268
I'm not worried.

28:05.269 --> 28:06.995
I've seen enough
romantic comedies to know

28:06.996 --> 28:09.160
guys like me are always
getting in jams like this.

28:09.161 --> 28:10.661
Not the school, the world.

28:10.662 --> 28:12.288
That's not how the world works.

28:13.707 --> 28:15.332
I know how much you helped me.

28:15.333 --> 28:17.710
It's just, it's hard here, Mom.

28:22.007 --> 28:24.967
Okay. I'll figure it out.

28:24.968 --> 28:26.969
All right, love you too.

28:26.970 --> 28:28.054
Bye, Mom.

28:39.149 --> 28:40.692
It's okay, Beck.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.037
- Hi, Becks!
- Hey, ..., where you at?

28:53.038 --> 28:54.371
Come play!

28:54.372 --> 28:56.540
Oh, I can't. I just had the worst day.

28:56.541 --> 28:58.459
Aww, Beckalicious, whatever it is,

28:58.460 --> 29:00.211
there's nothing that we can't fix, okay?

29:00.212 --> 29:02.213
Yes, us and copious amounts of alcohol.

29:02.214 --> 29:03.214
Oh, my God. There's a sale.

29:06.218 --> 29:07.516
You guys love me?

29:07.517 --> 29:09.386
- Of course!
- Why would you even say that?

29:09.387 --> 29:12.056
Okay, then. Meet me in Greenpoint.

29:12.057 --> 29:13.891
Look, why don't you come here, okay?

29:13.892 --> 29:15.226
Come here. It's actually really fun

29:15.227 --> 29:16.496
where we are. I promise.

29:16.497 --> 29:17.557
Yeah.

29:17.558 --> 29:19.730
There's something
I need to do for myself.

29:19.731 --> 29:21.023
I'll text you on my way.

29:21.024 --> 29:22.691
- See you soon.
- Bye.

29:29.407 --> 29:31.618
I guess we're going to Greenpoint, Beck.

29:41.836 --> 29:43.420
I never go to Greenpoint.

29:43.421 --> 29:46.226
But the things you do for love, right?

29:46.716 --> 29:48.759
Hi, um, okay, so we're gonna get

29:48.760 --> 29:49.927
a few more drinks.

29:49.928 --> 29:51.262
Hold on one second.

29:51.263 --> 29:53.222
Guys?

29:53.223 --> 29:55.557
What is she thinking? Open mics are for

29:55.558 --> 29:57.893
models/ singer-songwriters/vegans.

29:57.894 --> 29:59.603
I mean, these people don't
wanna hear some wannabe

29:59.604 --> 30:02.022
read a poem about the bleakness
of life or whatever.

30:02.023 --> 30:04.149
Your friends are disloyal.

30:04.150 --> 30:07.080
And that Peach is the worst.

30:10.115 --> 30:11.865
Another round of picklebacks.

30:11.866 --> 30:14.994
Beckish, do we think now is the night?

30:14.995 --> 30:16.495
Positive.

30:16.496 --> 30:18.372
All my life lately
has been about surviving.

30:18.373 --> 30:21.625
I need to remind myself why
I came here in the first place.

30:21.626 --> 30:22.960
- Yes!
- Yeah.

30:22.961 --> 30:24.336
- You go.
- Who do you keep texting?

30:24.337 --> 30:26.714
- I invited Benji.
- Beck.

30:26.715 --> 30:28.882
What? He likes poetry.

30:28.883 --> 30:30.634
- For sure.
- And he texted he was coming?

30:30.635 --> 30:34.263
He texted a row of smile emojis, like,

30:34.264 --> 30:35.973
45 minutes ago.

30:35.974 --> 30:37.182
Some guys are assholes,

30:37.183 --> 30:38.434
and you just have to realize that.

30:38.435 --> 30:40.144
I get it, Peach.

30:40.145 --> 30:42.855
No, you're the one who told me to
keep reminding you he's a bastard.

30:42.856 --> 30:45.707
Up next, we have Guinevere Beck.

30:45.708 --> 30:47.318
Whoo!

30:47.319 --> 30:48.694
- All right.
- All right.

30:48.695 --> 30:51.447
To vulnerability and...

30:51.448 --> 30:52.531
Yeah.

30:52.532 --> 30:53.991
- Cheers.
- Okay.

30:53.992 --> 30:55.868
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:55.869 --> 30:56.995
Kill it, Beck.

30:58.496 --> 31:01.832
Hey, everyone, um, I'm Beck,

31:01.833 --> 31:04.668
and I'm... not to sound like,
you know, whatever,

31:04.669 --> 31:07.796
but just... I'm a... I'm a poet.

31:07.797 --> 31:09.506
Yeah, you are!

31:09.507 --> 31:10.924
Whoo!

31:10.925 --> 31:12.135
Yeah, you are!

31:13.178 --> 31:17.139
One day, you won't need love anymore.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.641
One day, you won't walk through the world

31:19.642 --> 31:22.853
as though it was your job
to hold everything up.

31:22.854 --> 31:26.398
The sun, the hard part of the night,

31:26.399 --> 31:29.401
the secret time when you wake
to the sound of beating,

31:29.402 --> 31:32.279
rise to answer the door,
but he's not there

31:32.280 --> 31:34.740
because that sound
is coming from inside you.

31:34.741 --> 31:38.202
And you cannot answer it
no matter how far in you go.

31:38.203 --> 31:41.121
Wrap it up!

31:44.042 --> 31:45.209
Whoo!

31:45.210 --> 31:46.919
You loved him the way

31:46.920 --> 31:50.255
fragile kids love gorgeous bullies.

31:50.256 --> 31:54.218
You wrote songs about him...
uh, I mean...

31:54.219 --> 31:57.388
You wrote poems about him.

31:57.389 --> 31:59.973
You still write poems about him.

31:59.974 --> 32:02.101
You're writing one right now.

32:02.102 --> 32:03.977
Why are you so sad?

32:03.978 --> 32:05.938
Just so sad.

32:05.939 --> 32:09.316
Just something happier
for a change might be nice.

32:09.317 --> 32:11.485
I think everyone agrees.

32:11.486 --> 32:12.903
Can we get the singer back?

32:12.904 --> 32:13.904
She was...

32:13.905 --> 32:15.447
Sorry, I, uh...

32:15.448 --> 32:17.116
I just, um... I lost my place.

32:17.117 --> 32:19.284
It'll just take a second
to find where I was.

32:19.285 --> 32:20.828
I can't stand seeing this.

32:20.829 --> 32:23.414
I'm sorry. I-I just can't.

32:23.415 --> 32:26.291
It's obvious what you are.
You're blind with love.

32:26.292 --> 32:28.168
And what you love... writing,

32:28.169 --> 32:29.628
this city, your friends,

32:29.629 --> 32:31.130
most of all, men like Benji...

32:31.131 --> 32:32.756
what all those have in common is,

32:32.757 --> 32:34.633
they will never love you back,

32:34.634 --> 32:36.135
while you give everything.

32:37.512 --> 32:38.762
It's crazy, the lengths we go.

32:38.763 --> 32:41.098
We're a lot alike, Beck.

32:41.099 --> 32:42.933
Last of the true romantics.

32:54.696 --> 32:56.238
I was considering this
with my new friend,

32:56.239 --> 32:57.735
Mr... Homeless Guy,

32:57.736 --> 33:00.617
when the second luckiest thing
this week happened.

33:02.871 --> 33:04.663
Could it really be?

33:04.664 --> 33:06.957
It feels like I'm dreaming.

33:09.794 --> 33:12.212
- I'm not.

33:12.213 --> 33:14.256
Beck, you're too drunk to be alone.

33:14.257 --> 33:17.134
What if some sicko
had followed you down here?

33:17.135 --> 33:20.304
And you're too wasted to be standing
so close to the tracks. Beck!

33:20.305 --> 33:22.473
Beck, stop texting
that arrogant club soda

33:22.474 --> 33:24.391
no-show ...head.

33:31.483 --> 33:33.108
You want Benji.

33:35.737 --> 33:37.237
You need Benji.

33:37.238 --> 33:39.072
You hold that phone like it is Benji

33:39.073 --> 33:41.450
'cause it's your only means
to stay connected.

33:41.451 --> 33:43.087
Forget Benji.

33:44.871 --> 33:47.372
And to... with that phone!

33:47.373 --> 33:49.833
Pick it up. Pick it up.

33:49.834 --> 33:52.419
Pick it up. Pick it up.

34:00.470 --> 34:01.845
Hey, hey, hey!

34:01.846 --> 34:03.138
You okay?

34:03.139 --> 34:04.681
Are you all right? Can you stand up?

34:04.682 --> 34:06.433
Just stay still.

34:06.434 --> 34:08.185
Half that... down there
can electrocute you, all right?

34:08.186 --> 34:09.728
So just give me your hand.

34:09.728 --> 34:11.271
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

34:11.272 --> 34:12.272
Pick it up. Pick it up!

34:12.273 --> 34:13.690
Sir, please shut up!

34:13.690 --> 34:14.775
- Pick it up!
- Give me your hand.

34:14.775 --> 34:16.568
The train's coming.

34:16.569 --> 34:18.237
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

34:18.237 --> 34:19.530
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

34:22.449 --> 34:23.992
Your hand, now!

34:23.993 --> 34:25.159
Pick it up!

34:25.161 --> 34:26.786
Pick it up!

34:45.389 --> 34:47.349
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34:47.350 --> 34:48.559
- Whoo!
- I am so sorry.

34:48.560 --> 34:49.851
No, it's fine. It's fine.

34:49.851 --> 34:53.063
I, uh... I hated... I hated this jacket.

34:53.063 --> 34:55.440
I really am sorry.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.942
It's okay.

34:56.943 --> 34:57.986
Do you mind?

35:00.405 --> 35:01.739
Sure, um...

35:04.909 --> 35:07.036
You know what? Let's get you
in a cab, all right?

35:09.998 --> 35:12.041
I'm not always like this.

35:14.794 --> 35:16.920
I figured you had some kinda night.

35:16.921 --> 35:18.881
Some kinda...

35:21.384 --> 35:24.220
Hey, I don't wanna sound
like a stalker, but...

35:25.638 --> 35:27.389
I think I know you.

35:27.390 --> 35:29.058
Paula Fox?

35:30.268 --> 35:31.643
Oh, right, right!

35:31.644 --> 35:32.769
Of course.

35:32.770 --> 35:35.105
I remember. I'm sorry.

35:35.106 --> 35:37.441
This is what I look like when I'm sober

35:37.442 --> 35:38.609
and have my hair up.

35:38.610 --> 35:41.028
Yeah, no, I remember.

35:41.029 --> 35:44.239
It's okay. I have a pretty bland face.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.543
No, you don't.

35:48.119 --> 35:49.870
Yeah, uh, "Desperate Characters."

35:49.871 --> 35:51.132
I remember.

35:51.706 --> 35:53.207
Yeah.

35:54.042 --> 35:55.167
Where you headed?

35:55.168 --> 35:56.501
Village.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.337
Are you anywhere close?

35:58.338 --> 35:59.546
Ride with me.

35:59.547 --> 36:01.256
It's the least I can do.

36:03.468 --> 36:04.468
Okay.

36:16.981 --> 36:18.899
Did you move here to be something?

36:18.900 --> 36:20.609
I did, but it's not working out,

36:20.610 --> 36:22.694
and I'm just running around
18 hours a day.

36:22.695 --> 36:23.945
Why?

36:26.324 --> 36:28.450
Oh, God, never mind. Sorry.

36:28.451 --> 36:30.285
No, please.

36:30.286 --> 36:32.746
I feel the same way sometimes.

36:32.747 --> 36:35.248
This guy I know, he owns the bookstore.

36:35.249 --> 36:37.542
He once told me that all books

36:37.543 --> 36:41.797
add up to one essential truth,

36:41.798 --> 36:44.633
which is, if your IQ is above
a certain number...

36:46.511 --> 36:48.053
Life is pretty much unbearable.

36:48.054 --> 36:50.347
And the number is not even that high.

36:52.517 --> 36:55.727
I do think I'd be happier
if I was stupider.

36:56.871 --> 36:59.106
But then the world
wouldn't know your poetry.

36:59.107 --> 37:01.316
How'd you know I write poetry?

37:04.237 --> 37:07.280
Doesn't every young writer in New York?

37:07.281 --> 37:08.865
I mean, I read a lot of poetry.

37:11.536 --> 37:13.172
Who do you like?

37:13.705 --> 37:16.331
Strand, Sexton, Merrill.

37:16.332 --> 37:19.042
You're describing my nightstand.

37:19.043 --> 37:22.212
Well, if you read them
to get to sleep every night,

37:22.213 --> 37:24.256
then you definitely belong here.

37:26.175 --> 37:28.135
What was your last name again?

37:28.136 --> 37:29.386
Goldberg.

37:30.888 --> 37:33.765
Where did you come from, Joe Goldberg?

37:33.766 --> 37:35.267
I grew up here.

37:37.353 --> 37:39.146
I left for a little while,

37:39.147 --> 37:40.313
chasing a girl.

37:40.314 --> 37:42.399
Mm, but you came back?

37:42.400 --> 37:44.078
Yeah, I missed it.

37:44.736 --> 37:46.403
And I'm not a good chaser.

37:46.404 --> 37:48.905
Hmm, me neither.

38:06.340 --> 38:07.592
Oh.

38:09.552 --> 38:12.471
Oh, this is, uh... this is me.

38:12.472 --> 38:15.098
Mm, it's not bad.

38:15.099 --> 38:17.653
Thank you for sobering me up.

38:18.227 --> 38:19.978
And for saving my life.

38:19.979 --> 38:22.439
No, I didn't... I didn't save your life.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.607
Yeah, you did.

38:33.534 --> 38:35.327
Oh, God.

38:35.328 --> 38:37.287
Of course.

38:37.288 --> 38:39.039
- Benji.
- Hi.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.832
Um, this is Joe.

38:40.833 --> 38:43.502
He literally saved my life tonight.

38:43.503 --> 38:45.378
I-I fell on the tracks.

38:45.379 --> 38:46.797
It was crazy.

38:46.798 --> 38:49.644
Babe, I told you,
people are basically good.

38:50.134 --> 38:51.510
It's a great job, bro.

38:51.511 --> 38:54.179
Bro? You waste of hair.

38:54.180 --> 38:56.766
Okay, Beck, it's freezing out here.

39:01.229 --> 39:04.105
Wait, uh, maybe I can get your info.

39:04.106 --> 39:06.317
Yeah, um...

39:12.636 --> 39:13.961
..., my phone.

39:14.992 --> 39:16.493
I must have dropped it in the subway.

39:16.494 --> 39:18.370
Oh.

39:18.371 --> 39:21.581
Oh, okay, well, um,
just maybe give me your number

39:21.582 --> 39:23.500
for when you get a replacement?

39:23.501 --> 39:26.044
I'm basically enslaved to email.

39:26.045 --> 39:27.879
I get it. Smart.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.006
I'm practically a stranger.
Can't be too careful.

39:30.007 --> 39:31.258
Okay.

39:31.259 --> 39:34.928
It's beckinreallife@gmail.com.

39:34.929 --> 39:36.513
All right.

39:38.391 --> 39:40.100
Beck in real life.

39:40.101 --> 39:41.518
Thank you.

39:45.565 --> 39:47.065
So here's what I learned this week.

39:47.066 --> 39:48.525
I'm sorry I didn't make it. You know.

39:48.526 --> 39:50.694
You are special. You're talented.

39:50.695 --> 39:52.206
You're passionate.

39:53.030 --> 39:54.322
You're smart...

39:57.034 --> 39:59.578
Except in the ways you're really not,

39:59.579 --> 40:01.246
like not locking your phone

40:01.247 --> 40:03.290
and falling for men like Benji.

40:03.291 --> 40:06.793
You know better,
but you can't stop because...

40:06.794 --> 40:08.628
well, because everyone needs someone.

40:08.629 --> 40:10.547
What you really need
is someone to save you.

40:10.548 --> 40:12.674
I can help, Beck.

40:12.675 --> 40:14.020
Let me help you.

40:19.223 --> 40:20.390
Joe.

40:23.311 --> 40:24.895
Pac, hey.

40:24.896 --> 40:26.771
What's going on?
What are you doing out here?

40:26.772 --> 40:28.367
It's Ron.

40:29.317 --> 40:31.287
He came home drunk.

40:31.819 --> 40:33.820
He started yelling,

40:33.821 --> 40:35.530
saying I thought I was smart,

40:35.531 --> 40:37.991
reading my books and looking
at him like he's dumb.

40:37.992 --> 40:39.743
What... what happened?

40:39.744 --> 40:41.411
Did he hurt you?

40:41.412 --> 40:43.246
No, he didn't touch me.

40:53.132 --> 40:55.133
I tried to stop him.

40:55.134 --> 40:56.593
I'm sorry.

40:56.594 --> 40:59.804
Paco, Paco, it's okay.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.181
Really, it's okay.

41:01.182 --> 41:02.474
You know what? Come with me.

41:02.475 --> 41:04.184
We can fix this together, all right?

41:10.399 --> 41:12.150
So, you know, the first step
to fixing something

41:12.151 --> 41:15.278
is to know no matter
how destroyed it seems,

41:15.279 --> 41:16.906
it can always be saved.

41:18.199 --> 41:20.825
Books are no exception.

41:20.826 --> 41:21.868
You got it?

41:21.869 --> 41:23.014
Got it.

41:23.015 --> 41:25.622
So what we have here is a line press.

41:25.623 --> 41:27.624
Basically just a huge clamp.

41:27.625 --> 41:31.336
Polyvinyl acetate glue means
no acid to burn the pages.

41:31.337 --> 41:34.839
Got your needle, thread, and finally...

41:34.840 --> 41:36.936
right out of "Bugs Bunny"...

41:37.718 --> 41:38.718
a trusty mallet.

41:40.680 --> 41:41.680
You see this?

41:44.684 --> 41:45.809
We don't need this.

41:50.022 --> 41:51.731
Johno, listen to this!

41:51.732 --> 41:53.900
"Dear Benji, heard about your soda.

41:53.901 --> 41:55.193
"I'm interested in including you

41:55.194 --> 41:56.778
"on my fall list of must-tries.

41:56.779 --> 41:58.446
"Would love to discuss,
perhaps even try some.

41:58.447 --> 41:59.948
Jeff Pevensey."

41:59.949 --> 42:01.408
That's the dude you're always retweeting?

42:01.409 --> 42:03.535
It's the culture guy
from "New York" magazine.

42:05.287 --> 42:07.163
Hit him back, bro.

42:07.164 --> 42:08.581
No...

42:08.582 --> 42:10.083
Back off while I think.

42:10.084 --> 42:12.085
Jeff, comma,

42:12.086 --> 42:14.671
so nice to hear from you, bud, period.

42:14.672 --> 42:16.923
Yeah, our sodas are legit, period.

42:16.924 --> 42:18.299
I would love to meet up

42:18.300 --> 42:21.052
to have you try the goods, period.

42:21.053 --> 42:22.345
Let's set something up.

42:27.101 --> 42:29.894
Scrape carefully along the spine.

42:29.895 --> 42:32.188
Of course, you gotta watch your fingers.

42:38.195 --> 42:40.071
"Sounds great.
I can call between meetings

42:40.072 --> 42:41.906
to see if you're available."

42:41.907 --> 42:44.576
This is gonna take us next level.

42:44.577 --> 42:45.744
What time you think we'll meet?

42:47.997 --> 42:50.540
No offense. We discussed this.

42:50.541 --> 42:52.751
It's best if the product
has one clear face

42:52.752 --> 42:53.918
at the beginning.

42:53.919 --> 42:55.628
That's just more me.

42:58.632 --> 43:00.467
Okay, the spine is sewn.

43:00.468 --> 43:01.718
So take this.

43:01.719 --> 43:02.802
Pull it as tight as you can that way.

43:04.180 --> 43:06.097
Yeah, that's it.

43:14.648 --> 43:16.232
Jeff!

43:16.233 --> 43:19.235
The glue is set.
We've applied the binder.

43:19.236 --> 43:20.612
Now...

43:22.323 --> 43:24.407
You gotta be precise

43:24.408 --> 43:26.743
and use exactly the force needed.

43:38.547 --> 43:39.589
Hey!

43:41.550 --> 43:42.884
Nice to meet you, man.

43:42.885 --> 43:44.302
Nice to meet you too.

43:44.303 --> 43:45.970
Have you... have you been here before?

43:45.971 --> 43:48.723
It's, uh... not a lot of people
know about it yet.

43:48.724 --> 43:52.185
It's an incredible after hours.
Very exclusive.

43:52.186 --> 43:54.646
Yeah, I've been here a couple of times.

43:54.647 --> 43:55.980
- Yeah?
- Mm.

43:55.981 --> 43:58.118
Huh. Well, good.

43:59.026 --> 44:01.277
So you'll feel right at home, then.

44:08.202 --> 44:10.631
Please, after you.

44:11.122 --> 44:13.331
All right.

44:16.961 --> 44:19.838
It's just down to the left.

44:33.018 --> 44:35.979
Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

44:58.294 --> 45:00.044
IT'S 2:00 p.m. when the door chimes,

45:00.045 --> 45:02.005
and I'm ready.

45:03.716 --> 45:05.550
You told your girlfriends you'd come by.

45:05.551 --> 45:07.594
I know this because I have your phone.

45:07.595 --> 45:09.679
- I'll be in back.
- Okay.

45:09.680 --> 45:11.097
Hey.

45:11.098 --> 45:12.432
Remember me?

45:12.433 --> 45:15.602
Almost dying on the train tracks?

45:15.603 --> 45:17.645
Uh, it rings a bell.

45:17.646 --> 45:19.147
Hang on. Hang on.

45:19.148 --> 45:21.160
Well, I wanted to say thank you.

45:21.692 --> 45:23.526
No, you already did that.

45:23.527 --> 45:26.613
Well, uh, thanks again.

45:26.614 --> 45:30.492
And I'm sorry for, uh,
running off the other night.

45:31.202 --> 45:33.329
- You had a guest.
- Hardly.

45:34.872 --> 45:37.665
So I got you a present.

45:37.666 --> 45:39.481
No, no, no, please. You don't
have to get me anything.

45:39.482 --> 45:41.754
Shut up and just look at it.

45:47.218 --> 45:49.802
"Engine, engine number nine
on the New York Transit line.

45:49.803 --> 45:52.013
"If your girl falls on the track,

45:52.014 --> 45:53.473
pick her up, pick her up, pick her up."

45:53.474 --> 45:55.850
We already have in jokes.

45:55.851 --> 45:58.072
So...

45:59.271 --> 46:01.856
anyway, that, and I'd better...

46:01.857 --> 46:05.652
Maybe if you're not too busy,

46:05.653 --> 46:07.779
we could get a drink sometime?

46:07.780 --> 46:09.249
Sure.

46:09.907 --> 46:12.158
Oh, but I still can't find my phone.

46:12.159 --> 46:14.463
I know. Email.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.496
That's right.

46:20.209 --> 46:21.876
See you, Joe.

46:21.877 --> 46:24.462
See you soon, Beck.

46:31.303 --> 46:34.180
Well played, sir.

46:34.181 --> 46:36.100
Well played.

46:37.434 --> 46:38.810
I'm not always right.

46:38.811 --> 46:40.103
I'm human. I make mistakes.

46:40.104 --> 46:41.604
You'll see.

46:41.605 --> 46:43.564
I have to check on a shipment downstairs.

46:43.565 --> 46:45.191
Can you... um,
can you watch the register?

46:45.192 --> 46:46.234
Yeah.

46:47.778 --> 46:50.332
..., maybe I'm just a fool in love.

46:51.198 --> 46:53.241
But I'm right about you.

46:53.242 --> 46:56.286
And I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve, Beck.

47:11.593 --> 47:15.763
Please, whatever you think I did,

47:15.764 --> 47:17.557
you got the wrong guy.

47:17.558 --> 47:19.695
No...

47:20.644 --> 47:22.312
I don't.
