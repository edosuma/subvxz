WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:03.046
I can't believe

00:03.090 --> 00:04.613
this is where I'm getting married.
Mm-hmm.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.006
Thanks for making this happen.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.487
I'm moving in with Sumi.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.576
- Oh!
- We're back together.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.839
So I'm not sure if you're taking
new clients right now.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.580
I'm Alice Kwan, thank you.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.234
Hilarious set.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.062
Do you have a rep
I should get in touch with?

00:19.106 --> 00:22.065
- She's right here!
- Actually, no.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.372
Apparently, I'm not
your manager anymore.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.463
<i>So how are things</i> <i>
going with Ryan?</i>

00:28.506 --> 00:31.944
She's like a real, mature adult.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.947
<i>Are you playing games</i> <i>
with me and Gillian?</i>

00:34.991 --> 00:36.471
I think we need to talk.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.996
I'm working
and living on a farm.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.650
We call this place "The Colony."

00:41.693 --> 00:43.391
<i>So you all, like,</i> <i>
live here together too?</i>

00:43.434 --> 00:44.566
<i>Yes.</i>

00:44.609 --> 00:46.307
You step foot
on this farm again,

00:46.350 --> 00:47.482
I'll call the sheriffs.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.051
What are you doing here, man?

00:51.094 --> 00:52.313
<i>Came to give you this.</i>

00:52.356 --> 00:53.879
What is it?

00:53.923 --> 00:56.099
I'm being ordered
to stay 250 feet away
from Jenna.

00:56.143 --> 00:59.363
But I'd really,
really appreciate it if

00:59.407 --> 01:01.670
<i>we didn't</i> <i>
involve our families</i> <i>
in our relationship.</i>

01:01.713 --> 01:03.193
<i>Mine will not be a problem.</i>

01:33.354 --> 01:34.137
What's wrong?

01:35.486 --> 01:39.229
Um... I just got a text
from your father.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.143
He wants me to call him.

01:43.538 --> 01:44.713
Please don't.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.152
I won't.

01:49.196 --> 01:52.155
This is the perfect example
of crossing boundaries,

01:52.199 --> 01:54.549
and I refuse
to indulge your parents

01:54.592 --> 01:56.159
in this ridiculous idea

01:56.203 --> 01:57.943
that we should put
the baby up for adoption.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.209
I'm deleting the message
and blocking his number.

02:04.341 --> 02:04.950
Okay?

02:07.257 --> 02:08.171
Okay.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.791
<i>Isabella, this is your father.</i>

02:19.835 --> 02:21.619
<i>I'm running out of patience.</i>

02:21.663 --> 02:23.186
<i>If I don't see proof</i> <i>
that you're serious</i>

02:23.230 --> 02:25.188
<i>about putting the baby</i> <i>
up for adoption,</i>

02:25.232 --> 02:27.321

04:04.331 --> 04:06.724
Who stands in support of Jazmin
on her wedding day?

04:08.117 --> 04:09.031
I do.

04:13.601 --> 04:14.732
Who else?

04:18.345 --> 04:19.520
- We do.
- We do.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.349

Well, your parents
must be thrilled,

04:43.065 --> 04:45.285
now that you and Isabella
are together.

04:45.328 --> 04:48.331
Oh, actually,
I-- I haven't told them yet.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.899
Wait. Why not?
Are you having doubts?

04:50.942 --> 04:53.728
No! It's just--
It's still pretty new

04:53.771 --> 04:55.556
and they're gonna
immediately assume

04:55.599 --> 04:57.427
that we're getting married
and put all this pressure on us.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.299
So no.

04:59.342 --> 05:02.563
- And Isabella's okay with this?
- Yeah.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.347
Yeah, no, we're completely
on the same page.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.436
No, that's bullshit.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.568
There's no way that she's okay

05:07.611 --> 05:09.004
with being pregnant
with your child

05:09.047 --> 05:12.181
and being in a secret
relationship with you.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.270
If you're not having doubts,
then what are you waiting for?

05:29.416 --> 05:31.505
Oh, hey! What's up?

05:31.548 --> 05:33.420
I don't wanna be
in a fake relationship
with you anymore.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.509
Are you really
fake breaking up with me?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.902
I know I didn't treat you well
when we were together,

05:37.946 --> 05:39.513
but I've done a lot of work
to mend that.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.558
- I know--
- And I've been there for you

05:41.602 --> 05:42.777
through thick and thin.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.867
And I've worked hard
to earn your trust.

05:45.910 --> 05:46.911
But now, Alice,

05:47.869 --> 05:48.913
I don't trust you.

06:03.798 --> 06:06.322
<i>Señor</i> Martinez,

06:06.366 --> 06:07.802
I got you your favorite.
Cuba Libre.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.065
You mean a <i>mentirita.</i>

06:11.762 --> 06:13.373
Right. The little lie.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.856
<i>¿Cómo estás?</i>

06:18.900 --> 06:20.292
<i>¿Yo? Excelente.</i>

06:22.947 --> 06:24.949
Look, I know
it must've been hard

06:24.993 --> 06:26.647
not walking Jazmin
up to the altar.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.391
I've come so far.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.610
Accepting all of this.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.091
Having a daughter...

06:39.834 --> 06:41.705
I imagined that I'd walk her
down the aisle.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.450
But that's not
what your sister wanted.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.674
And seeing Jazmin happy,

06:57.025 --> 06:58.243
that's all that matters.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.423
<i>Estoy orgulloso de ti, Papi.</i>

07:11.387 --> 07:12.432
Whatcha doing up here?

07:14.390 --> 07:16.000
Having a quickie with Joaquin?

07:17.567 --> 07:19.134
No, I was just freshening up
my makeup.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.571
Yeah, well, I called dibs on him
when he first moved in

07:21.615 --> 07:25.096
and now you two are clearly
doing the no-pants dance.

07:25.140 --> 07:28.317
Okay, I had no idea
that you were actually serious

07:28.360 --> 07:29.405
about having feelings for him.

07:30.362 --> 07:31.668
Why wouldn't I be serious?

07:32.669 --> 07:34.541
Well, to be honest,

07:34.584 --> 07:35.933
you're not really serious
about anything.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.587
What?

07:37.631 --> 07:39.546
I'm serious
about plenty of things.

07:39.589 --> 07:42.549
Okay, well, you don't
have to worry about anything

07:42.592 --> 07:43.941
because there's nothing
going on between us.

07:43.985 --> 07:44.638
Trust me.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.337
Hey!

07:48.380 --> 07:50.513
So I was doing
some research on cults,

07:50.557 --> 07:54.212
and I found out
if they hinder the freedom
of their members in any way,

07:54.256 --> 07:56.084
they can be dismantled
for criminal activity.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.042
Can we please not talk
about this right now?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.392
Uh-- Sure.

08:00.436 --> 08:01.698
I just wanted you to know

08:01.742 --> 08:03.308
that we do have ways
of getting around--

08:03.352 --> 08:05.659
I said I don't wanna
talk about it right now.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.356
And for the record,
this is not a "we" thing.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.097
This is my problem.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.490
If anything,
you're probably just

08:11.186 --> 08:12.448
a distraction.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.498
Yeah, I'm not buying it.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.590
You broke a code, Mariana.

08:23.633 --> 08:27.463
You broke the most important
and sacred of codes.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.553
Uh, the girl code!

08:41.303 --> 08:42.130
Sorry.

08:45.350 --> 08:48.702
Jaz, you know
how much I love you

08:48.745 --> 08:52.706
and how much
you've always been there for me.

08:52.749 --> 08:55.622
And it makes me so happy
that you found someone

08:55.665 --> 08:58.276
who truly sees
how special you are.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.409
Spencer...

09:00.452 --> 09:01.889
brother...

09:01.932 --> 09:03.412
Oh, yeah!

09:03.455 --> 09:04.544
...welcome to the family, man.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.677
And as part of my gift,

09:07.721 --> 09:11.594
I have asked
two of my really good friends

09:11.638 --> 09:15.163
to sing
for the bride and groom's
first dance.

09:17.469 --> 09:20.951
Dennis Cooper, Davia Moss,
take it away.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.213
Thank you.

Shit!

11:55.062 --> 11:55.889
What?

12:14.908 --> 12:16.083
Hey! There you are.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.695
Thanks for the song.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.001
That was beautiful.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.263
I'm honored you asked.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.223
So, uh, random question.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.051
Uh, does Ryan know
about you and Davia?

12:29.139 --> 12:30.706
We were just singing, dude.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.970
Oh, no, no, no. I mean,
like, your history together.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.058
No.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.452
Why?

12:37.495 --> 12:40.150
Well, Ryan may have overheard

12:40.194 --> 12:42.849
Isabella and I...
talking about you guys.

12:45.112 --> 12:49.769
And just pure conjecture,
that you might possibly still,

12:49.812 --> 12:52.249
maybe, potentially, kind of
be in love with each other.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.386
Sorry.

12:58.429 --> 13:01.258
I've, uh, actually
never done this before.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.694
Gael just hired me
to get interviews

13:02.738 --> 13:05.001
with Jazmin's family and friends
as a wedding gift.

13:05.045 --> 13:07.743
He's a good brother.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.138
Your whole family's really,
really great, by the way.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.879
- You're lucky.
- Yes, we are.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.143
Where is your family?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.276
I don't really have one.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.148
Um, my parents died
when I was a kid.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.107
I'm so sorry.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.240
Uh, no, it's-- it's-- it's okay.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.328
It was a long time ago.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.854
And you have no one else?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.682
Um, I don't really know.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.076
I'm not in touch
with anyone, but...

13:38.339 --> 13:40.471
Actually, you kinda remind me
of my grandpa.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.476
What was he like?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.478
He was just, you know, kind.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.524
Like, he was a cool guy.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.703
Yeah, I know
if he had been alive
when my parents died,

13:54.746 --> 13:55.660
he would've taken me in,

13:57.010 --> 13:58.054
looked after me.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.755
So, um... are you ready?

14:07.585 --> 14:08.848
Enjoy.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.852
Hey!

14:13.809 --> 14:15.115
Um, so there's...

14:15.506 --> 14:16.812
Thank you.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.553
...something you should
maybe know.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.294
What?

14:20.337 --> 14:23.950
Ryan might've heard
Isabella and I talking earlier.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.083
About what?

14:37.702 --> 14:40.009
I dropped by because I wanted
to say this in person.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.100
I'm sorry.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.409
Thank you.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.541
And I'm also sorry

14:50.585 --> 14:52.979
that I accused you
of having ulterior motives

14:53.022 --> 14:54.284
for dating other people.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.721
I mean, you've been
so accepting of me

14:56.765 --> 14:57.984
exploring being poly.

14:58.027 --> 15:00.464
I have no right to question you.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.639
It's okay.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.641
I understand.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.606
I don't wanna put
so much pressure

15:11.649 --> 15:13.956
- on what this is.
- Hey.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.610
Or where we're going, I just--

15:15.653 --> 15:17.742
We don't have to have
that conversation right now.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.965
So, uh...

15:25.011 --> 15:26.969
is this where we get
to have amazing makeup sex

15:27.013 --> 15:28.014
after our first fight?

15:28.057 --> 15:29.145
- Oh!
- Yeah.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.497
- I mean, if you insist.
- I definitely insist.

15:39.764 --> 15:40.896
Here you are, beautiful.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.550
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hm.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.509
I love weddings.

15:45.553 --> 15:48.512
The romance,
the celebration of love.

15:48.556 --> 15:49.992
And commitments.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.559
The promise of forever.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.740
They definitely
make you feel a certain way.

15:59.741 --> 16:00.960
They definitely do.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.364
What do you think?

16:14.408 --> 16:16.105
Will Jazmin and Spencer like it?

16:18.455 --> 16:22.024
I knew you painted when
you were younger, but wow!

16:22.068 --> 16:24.984
Where do you think your talent came from?

16:25.027 --> 16:27.029
Your <i>abuelo</i> was even accepted

16:27.073 --> 16:29.118
to <i>La Escuela Nacional</i> <i>
de Bellas Artes.</i>

16:30.815 --> 16:32.339
I never knew that.

16:32.382 --> 16:36.082
Well, the revolution
changed many plans.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.605
We came to the States,

16:37.648 --> 16:40.956
and I had to provide
for my family.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.697
I'm sorry you had
to give up your passion.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.090
I'm not.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.962
Sometimes,
what seems like a sacrifice

16:48.964 --> 16:51.358
is just a choice.

16:51.401 --> 16:56.754
Your father, your <i>abuela,</i>
they were my true passion.

16:56.798 --> 17:01.237
They gave me more rewards
than I could've ever dreamed of.

17:04.980 --> 17:08.984
<i>Como tú, tu hermana.</i>

17:10.594 --> 17:12.901
If I could do it all over again,

17:14.816 --> 17:16.600
I wouldn't change a thing.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.124
And who knows?

17:18.167 --> 17:22.084
If I had to paint
to put food on the table,

17:22.128 --> 17:24.869
eh, that might've taken
all the joy out of it.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.138
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

17:35.097 --> 17:38.057
The line for the ladies' room
downstairs is really long.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.449
Tell me about it.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.972
Great minds, right?

17:41.016 --> 17:41.843
Yeah.

17:43.714 --> 17:44.889
We have a lot in common.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.505
Well, I'll see you downstairs.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.768
Uh-huh.
See you down there, Davia.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.077
Okay... Ryan.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.007
Jesus!

18:16.051 --> 18:17.879
You scared the hell outta me.

18:17.922 --> 18:20.099
What are you doing,
lurking around up here?

18:20.142 --> 18:23.928
- I'm just waiting for Ryan.
- Oh, right.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.496
- Um, just a heads-up--
- Gael told me.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.282
But he isn't sure
that Ryan heard.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.761
I am.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.024
She for sure, heard Isabella
saying that we were...

18:34.200 --> 18:35.592
whatever she said we were.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.638
Did Ryan say something to you?

18:37.681 --> 18:39.596
Yeah, my name.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.468
Your name?
That's your hard proof?

18:41.511 --> 18:42.991
It's the way that she said it.

18:43.034 --> 18:46.125
It's a woman thing.
Just trust me. She knows.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.304
Hey! Look who I found up here
waiting for you.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.916
Yup. Right where I left him.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.613
Well, he's good at staying put.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.183
Uh, shit, you know what?

19:01.227 --> 19:03.838
I forgot my clutch in the stall,

19:03.881 --> 19:06.667
so I'll just see you both downstairs.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.804
You two really do make
beautiful music together.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.067
Thank you.
We've had a lot of practice.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.243
Uh, singing.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.549
Together.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.900
Shall we?

19:34.825 --> 19:36.523
Thank you for the words
and the song.

19:36.566 --> 19:37.567
So beautiful.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.221
You're welcome.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.530
Look at us.

19:43.573 --> 19:44.835
We're all grown up.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.316
Married.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.796
You having a baby.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.844
How are you
and, uh, Isabella doing?

19:55.019 --> 19:56.456
We're good.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.241
You know, you don't have
to worry about upstaging me

19:59.285 --> 20:01.243
if you wanna tell Mami and Papi.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.332
I mean, look at me.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.159
As if you could.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.214
I love you.

20:16.302 --> 20:16.867
I love you too.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.487
<i>Joaquin, is everything okay?</i>

20:27.530 --> 20:28.488
<i>Yeah, Mom.</i>

20:28.531 --> 20:30.446
I just wanted to let you know

20:30.490 --> 20:32.143
that I... I saw Jenna.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.014
She's alive.

20:34.537 --> 20:35.799
<i>Oh, thank the Lord.</i>

20:36.887 --> 20:38.672
<i>And how's she doing?</i> <i>
Is she okay?</i>

20:38.715 --> 20:39.934
<i>Yeah, no, she's-- she's fine.</i>

20:39.977 --> 20:41.892
<i>She's, uh,</i> <i>
she's working on a farm.</i>

20:41.936 --> 20:43.154
<i>Farm? Doing what?</i>

20:43.198 --> 20:45.156
Uh, beekeeping.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.637
They-- They, like, sell honey
to the farmer's markets.

20:47.681 --> 20:48.943
<i>Who is "they"?</i>

20:48.986 --> 20:51.728
I'm Silas. Welcome to our farm.

20:51.772 --> 20:52.903
<i>The other farm workers.</i>

20:52.947 --> 20:55.863
They all live
and work there together.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.647
<i>I don't have a good</i> <i>
feeling about this.</i>

20:57.691 --> 20:59.170
<i>You know your sister.</i>

20:59.214 --> 21:02.957
<i>She's easily seduced</i> <i>
by evil and darkness.</i>

21:03.000 --> 21:05.525
<i>You need to get her away</i> <i>
from these people.</i>

21:05.568 --> 21:07.178
Stop right there!

21:07.222 --> 21:09.790
I hear you, okay?

21:09.833 --> 21:11.879
But she's a grown woman,
there's nothing I can do.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.402
<i>I know that you've</i> <i>
always been selfish,</i>

21:13.446 --> 21:17.319
<i>but how can you stand by</i> <i>

21:17.363 --> 21:18.755
<i>You've forsaken God,</i>

21:18.799 --> 21:20.453
<i>and you have forsaken</i> <i>
your family,</i>

21:20.496 --> 21:22.411
<i>but this is your sister.</i>

21:36.469 --> 21:37.557
Hey. Hey.

21:38.993 --> 21:40.516
Let's dance.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.345
["Love We Make"

21:49.525 --> 21:51.310
I'm sorry

21:51.353 --> 21:52.572
for what I said earlier.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.009
I didn't mean it.

21:55.052 --> 21:58.273
Hey, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have found Jenna.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.538
It just feels like
Jenna could be in danger.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.410
There's gotta be
a way to get to her

22:04.453 --> 22:06.412
without violating the order.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.805
Yeah, maybe I could
publish a story

22:08.849 --> 22:10.546
exposing him and the cult.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.808
Somehow try to get it to Jenna.

22:14.550 --> 22:15.508
It's worth a shot.

Hey, girl.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.574
Why do you look like
you're at a funeral
instead of a wedding?

23:21.617 --> 23:24.490
Sumi found out
I was talking to a new rep.

23:24.533 --> 23:27.362
And now she's mad,
and she doesn't wanna be
my manager anymore.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.277
And she ended
our fake relationship.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.932
Wait, what do you
mean "fake relationship"?

23:31.975 --> 23:34.064
We weren't really back together.

23:34.108 --> 23:36.284
Yeah, we just pretended
to cover for Gael,

23:36.327 --> 23:38.329
who was subletting my loft
for Isabella.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.854
Seriously?
- Yeah, he was just worried that she would leave

23:40.897 --> 23:41.942
if she didn't have
a place to live.

23:44.118 --> 23:46.120
Look, I need Sumi.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.948
She's the most important person
in my life!

23:47.991 --> 23:50.690
- I just can't live without her.
- As your manager?

23:50.733 --> 23:52.387
Yes. Why?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.475
Because it sounds to me like

23:53.519 --> 23:54.476
you can't live without her because

23:54.520 --> 23:55.912
you're in love with her.

23:56.522 --> 23:57.653
What? No!

24:01.614 --> 24:02.919
Yes. Fine.

24:02.963 --> 24:05.531
I am. It's true.

24:05.574 --> 24:08.011
I just-- I just--
I'm-- I'm scared.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.710
I don't wanna get hurt again.

24:10.753 --> 24:14.104
So you hurt her
and pushed her away.

24:14.148 --> 24:18.195
Yeah, and now it's too late.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.849
I highly doubt it's too late.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.199
What you need to do

24:22.243 --> 24:24.375
is come up with
a big romantic gesture

24:24.419 --> 24:26.290
and... win her back.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.468
Like what?

24:29.511 --> 24:31.513
I don't know, girl!
I can't do all the work for you!

24:36.344 --> 24:38.085
Anyway, congrats.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.260
Can't believe
you're gonna be a father, man.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.914
You're gonna be a great dad.

24:40.957 --> 24:42.132
Thanks, I hope so.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.786
I know you paid
to sublet Alice's loft.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.094
Uh, I'm sorry,
can you excuse us?

24:47.137 --> 24:48.922
Of course.

24:48.965 --> 24:51.402
Did you tell me that you love me
just to keep me here?

24:51.446 --> 24:53.056
Ar-- Are you manipulating me

24:53.100 --> 24:54.405
so you can be part
of the pregnancy?

24:54.449 --> 24:56.582
Isabella, no.
I-- I wouldn't do that.

24:56.625 --> 24:59.410
Then why haven't you
told your parents about us?

24:59.454 --> 25:02.413
If you're not really in this,
just-- just say that.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.417
You're right.

25:08.637 --> 25:10.204
- Come here.
- What?

25:12.815 --> 25:16.036
Everyone, if I could have
your attention, please.

25:17.080 --> 25:17.646
What are you doing?

25:19.605 --> 25:22.433
Some of you already know this,

25:22.477 --> 25:24.435
but since
my whole family is here,

25:27.526 --> 25:30.224
I want you to know
that Isabella and I

25:30.267 --> 25:32.313
are not only expecting a baby,

25:34.707 --> 25:35.577
but we're together...

25:37.187 --> 25:38.972
- as a couple.
- Whoo!

25:49.983 --> 25:52.638
Oh, so I've decided
you can have Joaquin.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.161
He's all yours.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.380
I don't date men
who can't dance,

25:56.424 --> 25:57.773
and he probably sucks
in bed too.

25:57.817 --> 25:58.948
You poor thing.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.907
Unless, you know,
that is your thing.

26:02.517 --> 26:05.085
Um... thanks?

26:49.433 --> 26:50.347
I love you.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.270
I'm sorry.

27:00.314 --> 27:01.707
I need a-- I need a minute.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.459
Thank you, everyone,

27:15.503 --> 27:18.506

this special day

27:18.549 --> 27:20.813
even more unforgettable
than it already is.

27:21.944 --> 27:25.339
But before my husband...

27:29.299 --> 27:30.779
Before my husband

27:30.823 --> 27:33.129
sweeps me away
on our honeymoon...

27:33.173 --> 27:35.088
...I, uh...

I wanna make sure
we get in one last, um...

why I wanted Evelyn
to walk me to the altar.

28:28.315 --> 28:29.446

I don't appreciate--

28:30.796 --> 28:33.581
<i>Mija, mija,</i> it's okay.

28:33.624 --> 28:35.409
You don't have to explain.

28:35.452 --> 28:38.325
I realized tonight,
I didn't earn that honor,

28:40.719 --> 28:43.286
because I wasn't there for you
when you needed me most.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.336
Your mother and I
will be with you

28:49.379 --> 28:52.992
every step of the way
from this moment on.

28:53.035 --> 28:56.386
<i>♪ Todo cambió por ti</i>

28:56.430 --> 28:59.085
<i>♪ Que bendición hallarte</i>

28:59.128 --> 29:00.695
<i>♪ Al instante...</i>

29:00.739 --> 29:02.436
- I love you.
- I love you.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.322
<i>So I don't really know</i> <i>
the bride or groom,</i>

29:19.366 --> 29:21.324
<i>but I'd like to address</i> <i>
the spurious claims</i>

29:21.368 --> 29:23.674
<i>that I "don't take anything</i> <i>
seriously."</i>

29:25.372 --> 29:27.809
<i>So yeah, maybe I use humor</i> <i>
as a sort of armor</i>

29:27.853 --> 29:30.725
<i>because I'm more sensitive</i> <i>
than I want to let on.</i>

29:32.422 --> 29:34.294
<i>And perchance I didn't have</i> <i>
the best childhood.</i>

29:34.337 --> 29:36.252
<i>I was an army brat.</i> <i>
We moved around a lot.</i>

29:37.471 --> 29:39.821
<i>Never made any real friends,</i> <i>
except Norman.</i>

29:39.865 --> 29:41.257
<i>He's imaginary.</i>

29:41.301 --> 29:43.042
<i>And we still talk sometimes.</i>

29:43.085 --> 29:44.478
<i>Well, I mean,</i> <i>
I talk, he growls,</i>

29:44.521 --> 29:45.914
<i>because, you know,</i> <i>
he's a honey badger.</i>

29:46.872 --> 29:49.135
<i>Anyway, other kids,</i>

29:49.178 --> 29:54.009
<i>they always made fun of me</i> <i>
and thought I was weird.</i>

29:54.053 --> 29:55.576
<i>It was pretty lonely</i> <i>
growing up,</i>

29:55.619 --> 29:58.448
<i>so it's-- it's hard for me</i> <i>
to let people in.</i>

30:03.018 --> 30:04.672
<i>You know, maybe that's why</i> <i>
I've never had a boyfriend.</i>

30:11.897 --> 30:13.768
<i>So when I fall for someone,</i>

30:17.380 --> 30:19.078
<i>I really, really fall.</i>

30:23.212 --> 30:25.084
<i>'Cause, like,</i> <i>

30:36.225 --> 30:37.966
- How do you erase this?
- W-- Why?

30:38.010 --> 30:40.229
'Cause armor is underrated,

30:40.273 --> 30:42.884
and I pride myself
on being a mystery.

30:42.928 --> 30:43.885
Do you even know
where my loft is?

30:43.929 --> 30:45.974
Um...

30:46.018 --> 30:47.671
- No, actually, I--
- Exactly.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.068
Hello! Damsel in distress here!

30:53.112 --> 30:54.635
I'll-- I'll do it.

30:56.724 --> 30:57.551
Oh!

30:58.987 --> 31:00.902
Well, I was gonna get there.

31:02.948 --> 31:03.862
Thank you.

31:21.401 --> 31:22.228
Hi.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.621
Sumi.

31:24.665 --> 31:25.971
Sorry, I need a favor.

31:26.580 --> 31:27.929
I got an audition,

31:27.973 --> 31:29.104
and I need someone
to run lines with me.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.411
I'm not your manager.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.935
I know, but...
are you my friend?

31:34.936 --> 31:36.068
Just a little?

31:37.199 --> 31:38.026
Please.

31:40.942 --> 31:41.856
Fine.

31:48.297 --> 31:52.084
"Interior, LAX airport, day.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.390
"Our hero, Sandy,
barges through TSA

31:54.434 --> 31:59.961
and catches the beautiful, sexy,
brilliant Aaliyah at the gate."

32:00.005 --> 32:01.615
This is so unrealistic.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.138
TSA would be all over Sandy.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.618
Please remain in character.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.011
Okay.

32:11.581 --> 32:13.627
Aaliyah, don't leave!

32:13.670 --> 32:14.976
I'm sorry.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.586
I was a selfish jerk,

32:16.630 --> 32:18.849
and I don't want
any other hairdresser than you.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.851
All this for a hairdresser?

32:20.895 --> 32:22.592
Please just read the scene.

32:22.636 --> 32:23.724
Oh, yeah, sorry.

32:24.681 --> 32:25.856
"I don't know.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.858
"I felt really hurt and betrayed

32:27.902 --> 32:30.600
when you got bangs
from someone else."

32:30.644 --> 32:32.515
You're right.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.213
It was a moment of weakness.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.779
You're new
to the hairdressing game,

32:35.823 --> 32:37.738
and I was worried.

32:37.781 --> 32:41.046
But I realize no one
will ever care about my hair

32:42.264 --> 32:42.961
as much as you do.

32:46.225 --> 32:46.965
And I...

32:48.401 --> 32:50.272
will never...

32:50.316 --> 32:53.014
care about anyone
as much as I care about you.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.975
I love you, Sumi... Aaliyah.

33:00.543 --> 33:01.936
And I do trust you.

33:04.025 --> 33:05.896
And I wanna be with you.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.898
If-- I mean,
if you can forgive me, 'cause--

33:23.523 --> 33:24.872
- Ooh!
- Oh.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.708
So what are we doing here?

33:35.665 --> 33:37.015
In my loft?

33:38.668 --> 33:42.672
Dennis, you're 40 and I'm 37.

33:42.716 --> 33:45.501
And we don't have
a lot of time to mess around.

33:46.328 --> 33:47.199
At least, I don't.

33:48.330 --> 33:49.897
I want a serious relationship

33:50.724 --> 33:51.681
and kids.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.641
Well, at least a-- a kid.

33:59.994 --> 34:02.692
I just don't have time
for casual dating.

34:02.736 --> 34:03.911
Is that what you think
I'm doing?

34:05.434 --> 34:06.479
I don't know.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.833
But I really like you.

34:14.965 --> 34:19.057
And... normally,
I would never push

34:19.100 --> 34:21.276
or, God forbid,
tell you how I really feel,

34:21.320 --> 34:23.452
'cause I wouldn't wanna
scare you away, but I--

34:23.496 --> 34:24.714
I really like you too.

34:27.021 --> 34:27.848
Okay.

34:28.675 --> 34:29.719
What about Davia?

34:30.851 --> 34:32.200
Were you two ever...

34:34.594 --> 34:35.812
We were and we weren't.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.424
Mostly, we weren't.

34:50.610 --> 34:51.698
Do you love her?

34:57.051 --> 34:57.965
Yes, I do.

35:00.272 --> 35:01.882
She's my friend.

35:01.925 --> 35:02.752
But that's...

35:03.884 --> 35:04.754
That's all we are.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.234
Friends.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.936
I'm not interested
in casual dating either.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.733
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

35:28.343 --> 35:29.736
Are you okay?

35:30.693 --> 35:31.825
Yes and no.

35:34.697 --> 35:35.742
I'm sorry.

35:38.527 --> 35:39.746
I didn't mean to freak you out.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.619
Maybe it was too soon.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.360
I just got caught up
in the moment.

35:45.404 --> 35:46.709
It wasn't too soon.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.278
I love you too.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.630
But I realized today

35:55.892 --> 35:57.416
I want what Jazmin
and Spencer have.

35:58.547 --> 35:59.722
So do I.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.159
I want it with one person.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.640
In one relationship.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.729
And you've been asking me
why I've been seeing Gillian.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.775
And maybe it's out of
self-preservation because...

36:13.475 --> 36:14.694
loving you is starting to hurt.

36:16.435 --> 36:17.697
And as much as I wanted

36:17.740 --> 36:20.700
to sweep this conversation
under the rug,

36:20.743 --> 36:22.571
I just don't think
I can do it anymore.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.054
We can't.

36:31.363 --> 36:32.625
I understand.

36:34.757 --> 36:38.631
And, you know, if I'm
being honest with myself, I...

36:40.285 --> 36:43.636
need someone who can
love me and accept me

36:43.679 --> 36:45.333
for all of who I am

36:45.377 --> 36:47.466
<i>so I'm not on eggshells</i> <i>
waiting for them to bail.</i>

36:48.554 --> 36:49.903
<i>You deserve that.</i>

37:27.288 --> 37:30.465
Ah.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.641
They were not kidding
about pregnancy sex.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.036
I could tell.

37:54.010 --> 37:56.056
So... I was thinking,

37:57.318 --> 37:59.538
what if I went
and worked with my dad?

38:00.278 --> 38:01.540
What about your art?

38:02.715 --> 38:04.107
I mean, I could still do my art.

38:05.370 --> 38:06.936
I might even enjoy it more

38:06.980 --> 38:09.417
if I didn't have the pressure
of making a living at it.

38:09.461 --> 38:10.636
Yeah.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.246
And the business is doing well.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.293
It could be a stable income
we could rely on.

38:15.336 --> 38:19.166
I mean, I support anything
that you really wanna do.

38:19.209 --> 38:22.343
But... I don't want you
to do this 'cause you're worried

38:22.387 --> 38:24.040
about supporting me
and the baby.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.260
And when the baby comes,

38:26.304 --> 38:28.262
I'll get a job,
and we'll make do,

38:28.306 --> 38:30.438
but I don't want you
to give up your passion.

38:32.571 --> 38:34.486
Isabella, you and the baby
are my passion.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.318
I want us to be a family.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.145
And...

38:45.192 --> 38:46.454
I wanna marry you.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.796
Who wants oat milk
with their leftover
wedding cake?

40:07.840 --> 40:08.580
Yes, please!

40:12.627 --> 40:15.369
I haven't had
a smiley-face pancake
since I was a kid.

40:16.065 --> 40:16.892
I aim to please.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.767
You okay with Ryan being here?

40:21.810 --> 40:23.203
Who?

40:23.246 --> 40:25.205
Oh, you mean the girl
wearing Dennis' favorite shirt?

40:25.248 --> 40:26.075
Didn't even notice her.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.867
Syrup and whipped cream?

40:34.910 --> 40:37.086
Don't knock it
before you try it.

40:39.915 --> 40:41.221
I told you.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.571
- Bacon?
- Oh, uh, no, thank you.

40:43.615 --> 40:46.400
The only porking I do
is in the bedroom.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.923
Kelly, we're eating.
Do you mind?

40:47.967 --> 40:49.577
How many people hooked up
with a stranger last night?

40:49.621 --> 40:51.623
Anyone?

40:51.666 --> 40:53.668
God, you guys are boring.
It's the whole purpose
of weddings.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.891
Oh, wow!

40:58.934 --> 41:00.153
You two look awfully happy.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.287
Okay, what's going on?

41:05.245 --> 41:06.638
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

41:06.681 --> 41:09.249
Well, I guess we have
an announcement to make.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.515
Oh! Hey, guys.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.300
Pretty sure
the bachelorette party
was, like, last week.

41:17.344 --> 41:19.172
We're looking
for Isabella Tavez.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.570
What do you want with her?

41:25.613 --> 41:26.484
Is she here?

41:32.228 --> 41:33.055
Um...

41:33.795 --> 41:35.797
Yeah, it's me.

41:38.452 --> 41:40.541
Isabella Tavez,
we have a warrant
for your arrest.

41:40.585 --> 41:43.152
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:43.196 --> 41:44.545
OFFICER 1:
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.199
Anything you do or say
can be used against you

41:46.242 --> 41:47.548
in a court of law.

41:47.592 --> 41:49.245
You can't just barge in here.
What did she do?

41:49.289 --> 41:51.247
OFFICER 2: Hey, step aside!

41:51.291 --> 41:53.511
I'm so sorry, Gael.
