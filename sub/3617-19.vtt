PAIGE [SINGING]:
âª Hush, little baby,
don't you cry âª

00:04.709 --> 00:08.067
âª Auntie's gonna buy
you a pumpkin pie âª

00:08.167 --> 00:12.442
âª And if that pie
doesn't taste real good âª

00:12.542 --> 00:16.899
âª Auntie's gonna buy you
some other kind of food âª

00:16.999 --> 00:20.918
âª And if that food
doesn't fill your tummy âª

00:23.834 --> 00:25.359
It's a lucky baby.

00:25.459 --> 00:30.317
I'm sorry, it's the only thing
I can do to soothe him nowadays.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.359
Why would you be sorry?

00:32.459 --> 00:34.900
Because normally I don't like
to embarrass myself

00:35.000 --> 00:38.526
until the fifth or sixth date.

00:38.626 --> 00:41.899
- Yeah.
- Humiliate, why?
You got a great voice.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.899
Better than most of the
singers I book at the club.

00:43.999 --> 00:49.025
Oh, you're just being sweet,
not that I mind sweet.

00:49.125 --> 00:51.067
Now, why don't you
like to sing?

00:51.167 --> 00:54.234
Something called
the eighth grade.

00:54.334 --> 00:57.899
Graduation. I was supposed
to sing the school song.

00:57.999 --> 01:02.734
Eight hundred people are
watching, the band is playing,
I get up,

01:02.834 --> 01:05.734
and no sound comes
out of my mouth.

01:05.834 --> 01:07.401
I completely froze.

01:07.501 --> 01:11.734
To make matters worse, I ran out
and missed my own graduation.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.234
- No.
- Yeah.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.651
I think eighth grade
sort of sucks for everybody.

01:15.751 --> 01:18.999
Yeah, mine just
kind of sucked publicly.

01:33.999 --> 01:37.150
That was nice. I...
haven't had that in a while.

01:37.250 --> 01:40.150
- Had what?
- Well, I like talking to you.

01:40.250 --> 01:43.859
- I like talking to you too.
- And I like kissing you.

01:43.959 --> 01:45.317
Kissing's good.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.942
And I'm kind of nervous.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.083
Me too.

01:53.459 --> 01:55.192
I should get you more wine.

01:55.292 --> 01:58.584
I'll get it. It's in
the kitchen, right?

- Get out. Get out. Nate's...

02:27.125 --> 02:28.899
...here.

02:28.999 --> 02:30.899
Hey, Nate, buddy,
how you doing?

02:30.999 --> 02:32.899
Good. Good.
I didn't hear you come in.

02:32.999 --> 02:35.292
Yeah, how about that?
Kind of like magic.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.025

CRONE:
You're back from the dead, dear.

02:48.834 --> 02:51.734
What? How?

02:51.834 --> 02:54.192
A simple "thank you"
will suffice.

02:54.292 --> 02:57.025
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

02:57.125 --> 03:01.609
Let's not strain your mind
with too much information.

03:01.709 --> 03:05.899
All I want,
in exchange for your life,

03:05.999 --> 03:07.818
is a meeting with your king.

03:07.918 --> 03:09.899
My king?
He'll never agree to it.

03:09.999 --> 03:12.918
Or I can put you back
where I found you.

03:14.292 --> 03:15.899
Tell your king

03:15.999 --> 03:17.818
that if he works with me,

03:17.918 --> 03:21.609
I'll serve him all three
Charmed Ones on a platter.

03:21.709 --> 03:22.899
You're after the Charmed Ones?

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
No, dear.

03:25.999 --> 03:28.709
I'm after their baby.

04:52.125 --> 04:56.401
Yes, Jason, I'm meeting with
the syndication consultants
today.

04:56.501 --> 04:58.899
But I've been doing
some preliminary research,

04:58.999 --> 05:01.401
and we've got Ann Landers,
Dear Abby, and E. Jean,

05:01.501 --> 05:03.899
but if Atlanta folds,
the South will be mine.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.275
I bore him.

05:05.375 --> 05:06.526
Yeah, well, I don't care

05:06.626 --> 05:09.692
if the South thinks my
column is too edgy, okay?

05:09.792 --> 05:12.899
I think the South
could use a little edge.

05:12.999 --> 05:14.999
What is that? What is it?

05:16.792 --> 05:18.651
- Kazi vanquish.
- Another one?

05:18.751 --> 05:21.025
- Paige is on it.
- Yes, of course I'm excited.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.526
Can't you tell that I'm excited?

05:22.626 --> 05:24.192
I just miss you.
When are you coming home?

05:24.292 --> 05:26.899
Okay, Mommy's got one
last picture left. You ready?

05:26.999 --> 05:28.899
Here we go. Smile, smile, smile.

05:28.999 --> 05:31.942
- One, two, three.
- PHOEBE: It's just
a lot to get used to.

Hey, big guy, you want
to do the popcorn machine?

Yes, he does.

Yeah, see, now he smiles.

05:49.876 --> 05:51.899
Okay, let's get you ready
for the fair, okay?

05:51.999 --> 05:53.692
I'm telling you, it's not gonna
fit. Nothing fits anymore.

05:53.792 --> 05:55.109
If he keeps growing at this
rate,

05:55.209 --> 05:57.899
we're gonna have to send him
to college by next week.

05:57.999 --> 06:00.167
Well, he will in these.

- Are you sure?
- PHOEBE: Jason, hang on a sec.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.651
- That's his hungry cry.
- Thanks.

06:10.751 --> 06:14.899
People, I am a terrible mother.
I am bad at this.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.526
- I don't even recognize
my own child's cries.
- It's a subtle difference.

06:18.626 --> 06:21.899

this maternal bond I
hear so much about?

Better than okay.
I am gonna have a love life.

06:33.792 --> 06:37.651
- You're making a love potion?
- No, I'm making a stun potion.

06:37.751 --> 06:39.651
So that lovers
will be stunned by you?

06:39.751 --> 06:40.899
No, so Kazis will
be stunned by me.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.692
You're in love
with a Kazi demon?

06:42.792 --> 06:44.651
Try to stay with me,
people.

06:44.751 --> 06:46.651
I am making a stun potion
so that I can maybe have a date

06:46.751 --> 06:48.776
that doesn't end with,
"Nate, you gotta leave.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.234
I have to clean some
demon guts off the ceiling."

06:51.334 --> 06:53.275
Nate, much cuter
than a Kazi demon.

06:53.375 --> 06:55.899
The potion you hold in your
hand is designed to stun,

06:55.999 --> 06:58.025
but not kill, Kazis.

06:58.125 --> 07:00.150
But I so enjoy killing them.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.942
But since the Kazi king
creates his demon minions
out of his own body--

07:03.042 --> 07:04.776
If we get the king,
then we get the Kazis.

07:04.876 --> 07:05.900
But we don't know
where the king is.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.942
But that's why I did
the stun potion.

07:08.042 --> 07:11.234
So if we capture one of his
minions, we can torture him--

07:11.334 --> 07:13.609
Then the king will feel the pain
and come in for the rescue.

07:13.709 --> 07:14.983
PIPER:
Or the minion will break

07:15.083 --> 07:18.899
and spill his guts
on the whereabouts of the king.

07:18.999 --> 07:20.900

sentence thing, not cute.

I'll get my hands
on the child.

08:25.501 --> 08:27.234
There's a law.

08:27.334 --> 08:29.692
Killing that child
is punishable by death.

08:29.792 --> 08:33.000
I know. I wrote the law.

08:34.082 --> 08:37.982
And I have no intention
of killing him.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.234
Then why?

08:40.333 --> 08:42.192
I had a vision,

08:42.292 --> 08:46.192
a mere taste of the future

08:46.292 --> 08:51.317
of the child, of power
like we've never known.

But I didn't see enough.
I need to know more.

No, clowns are scary.

are a no-no for infants.

Do you hear that buzzing?

12:45.542 --> 12:47.442
RICHARD:
Well, if I can start.

12:47.542 --> 12:50.192
I'd just like to dive right in
with a congratulations, Phoebe.

12:50.292 --> 12:52.899
I love your column.

12:52.999 --> 12:57.067
And I also want to say, not only
am I an image consultant,

12:57.167 --> 12:58.834
but I'm a fan as well.

12:59.626 --> 13:01.000
I'm sorry?

13:02.459 --> 13:04.150
I said, I'm a fan.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.609
Oh, you-- Oh, that's sweet.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.900
Thank you so much. Thank you.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.899
[DISTORTED] I think you're
beautiful, stylish,
approachable.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.776
That's why I don't want
to alter your look too much.

13:15.876 --> 13:17.234
"Author a book"?

13:17.334 --> 13:20.692
Wow, I don't know
if I'm ready for that.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.983
You know, one step at a time.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.150
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] I'm sorry?
- What?

13:25.250 --> 13:28.150
I'm sorry,
sometimes I mumble.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.983
I said "your look,"
not "your book."

13:30.083 --> 13:33.651
Oh, right, the hook.

13:33.751 --> 13:36.275
Yeah, to be honest with you,
"She has the answers,"

13:36.375 --> 13:38.209
it's kind of lame, right?

13:41.999 --> 13:43.584
Any ideas?

13:44.667 --> 13:46.899
[DISTORTED]
Well, I--

13:46.999 --> 13:50.109
- I mainly do image.

Are you okay?

14:03.918 --> 14:06.609
I'm-- I'm--
I think I'm gonna have to leave,

14:06.709 --> 14:09.709
because I'm not really feeling
too well. So thank you.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.584
Phoebe.

14:21.042 --> 14:23.025
Wow, you look beautiful.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.692
You've already said that.

14:24.792 --> 14:27.999
Yeah, but you look crazy
beautiful, so it bears
repeating.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.776
Okay, now I'm blushing,

14:31.876 --> 14:34.651
and my lipstick won't
match my cheeks.

14:34.751 --> 14:37.275
Well, since you're already
blushing, I have a little
bit of a surprise for you.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.899
But don't hate me,
all right?

14:38.999 --> 14:41.526
You're not gonna propose,
are you?

14:41.626 --> 14:43.234
No.

14:43.334 --> 14:45.899
In that case,
I like surprises.

14:45.999 --> 14:47.250
Good.

14:48.792 --> 14:51.983
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a special treat for you tonight

14:52.083 --> 14:54.899
to make your happy hour
just a little happier.

Are you kidding?

15:02.999 --> 15:04.899
Come on,
I thought you liked surprises.

15:04.999 --> 15:08.692
This is a bad surprise. Bad.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.125
Eighth grade was a long
time ago, Paige. Come on.

15:13.792 --> 15:16.526
Yeah, but that turned out
to be the worst day of my life.

15:16.626 --> 15:19.567
All my friends laughed at me.
Bobby Maynard dumped me.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.818
You dated a guy
named Bobby Maynard?

15:21.918 --> 15:24.899
That is not the point.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.859
Look, I'm already
losing my voice.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.818
This-- This is the
sound of panic.

15:28.918 --> 15:31.150
Look, Paige, you don't have to
sing if you don't want to.

15:31.250 --> 15:34.692
You just strike me as the type
of girl who likes to face her
fears,

15:34.792 --> 15:36.125
not run from them.

16:01.250 --> 16:05.999
This one is for all
the Bobby Maynards in the world.

16:15.501 --> 16:17.999

16:33.999 --> 16:35.792

Hello?

Anyone? Hello?

17:56.999 --> 17:59.692
I lost my hearing during
the biggest meeting of my life!

17:59.792 --> 18:01.667
I can't hear a thing!

18:02.167 --> 18:03.401

I can't hear you!

Oh, okay. Okay.

You're a monkey.

Oh, you're an angry monkey.

18:27.334 --> 18:29.999
Oh, you're pissed. You're...

18:31.584 --> 18:33.484

18:33.584 --> 18:35.025
No, no, of course not.

18:41.375 --> 18:44.150
Fireball.

18:44.250 --> 18:48.626
Okay. Yeah. A demon monkey
stole my hearing.

18:50.167 --> 18:54.501
And your voice too. Oh, honey.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.609
I don't understand
why you can't heal my eyes.

19:00.709 --> 19:02.859
I don't know,
your vision is just gone.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.899
- PIPER: Well, how is
that possible?
- You hear something?

19:04.999 --> 19:06.275
LEO:
I don't know.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.025
You hear puppets?

19:08.125 --> 19:11.484
I'll find Phoebe and Paige
after I put the baby down.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.401
- Where am I?
- In the conservatory.

19:13.501 --> 19:15.626
Just try and stay calm,
and try not to worry.

19:19.334 --> 19:20.959
You hear voices.
Voices, right.

19:23.334 --> 19:25.776
- Piper!
- I'm so glad you're here.

19:25.876 --> 19:28.526
I can't see a thing, and I
wrapped my car around a pole.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.609
- And I know it sounds crazy,
- Piper!

19:30.709 --> 19:32.899
but I think it has something to
do with that mangy monkey.

19:32.999 --> 19:35.359
- Piper!
- Where are you? Ow!

19:35.459 --> 19:37.692
Who put that there?

19:37.792 --> 19:40.651
Oh, my God. Piper, you're blind.

19:40.751 --> 19:45.275
Yeah. Phoebe, I just said that.
Now, can we talk about
how a monkey could do that?

19:45.375 --> 19:47.442
- What did she say?
- What did who say? The monkey?

19:47.542 --> 19:49.567
He didn't say anything.
He covered my eyes,

19:49.667 --> 19:53.317
- and stole my eyesight.
- I think the monkey stole

19:53.417 --> 19:55.234
your eyesight
when he covered your eyes.

19:55.334 --> 19:58.899
Phoebe, are you listening to me?
That's just what I said.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.484
You are acting like
you can't even hear me.

20:00.584 --> 20:03.983
Piper, it's no use,
I can't even hear you.

20:04.083 --> 20:07.442
- The monkey stole my hearing.
- Oh, he got you too,

20:07.542 --> 20:10.859
which means somebody sent that
flea-infested primate after us.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.484
We've gotta find Paige.

20:13.584 --> 20:15.359
Why are you clapping?
This is not funny.

20:15.459 --> 20:17.359
What's the matter, Paige?

20:17.459 --> 20:18.709
Paige? Where's Paige?

20:21.626 --> 20:23.250
What's going on?

20:28.334 --> 20:30.317
I see.

20:30.417 --> 20:35.067
Well, I don't.
Where is Paige?

20:35.167 --> 20:36.899
She just can't talk.

20:36.999 --> 20:39.651
Excuse me, this is either
someone's sick, sick joke,

20:39.751 --> 20:43.275
or someone's working
on a massive evil plan!

20:43.375 --> 20:46.234
Whatever it is, you guys are
in danger without your senses.

20:46.334 --> 20:49.899
Piper, you're the most
vulnerable, so I want you to
stay next to Wyatt.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.899
- His force field
will protect you.
- Okay.

20:52.999 --> 20:55.150
Paige, a Kazi attack
could be deadly right now.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.667
Make sure we're stocked up
on stun potion.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
PIPER:
Where are we going?

21:03.459 --> 21:05.900
Phoebe, check the
Book of Shadows,
see what you can find out

21:06.000 --> 21:09.125
about evil monkeys
and demons who control them.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.501
Come on.

21:14.167 --> 21:15.983
PIPER:
Paige.

21:16.083 --> 21:19.192
First we wait on a monkey,
and now what?

21:19.292 --> 21:21.651
What are we waiting on now?

21:21.751 --> 21:25.567
You're waiting on me.
Get used to it.

21:25.667 --> 21:29.900
Unlike you, I don't charge
in like a wild bull.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.025
I prefer to take my time
and succeed.

21:34.125 --> 21:38.109
- I say enough time has passed.
- Perhaps.

21:38.209 --> 21:42.734
First, we need to find out
if the monkey's magic has
taken effect.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.942
If so, you can
send in your warrior

21:46.042 --> 21:48.899
while I make my move
for the baby.

21:48.999 --> 21:52.609
How do we figure out if the
monkey has done his job?

21:52.709 --> 21:53.942
Common sense.

21:54.042 --> 21:56.317
You dare mock me?

21:56.417 --> 22:00.167
On occasion.
But not at the moment.

22:01.959 --> 22:05.734
This totem...

22:05.834 --> 22:09.983
...was created to trap senses.

22:10.083 --> 22:12.526
But with my magic,

22:12.626 --> 22:15.942
I can borrow what's inside here.

22:16.042 --> 22:18.776
So that's what
this is all about.

22:18.876 --> 22:22.150
You want to steal
the Charmed Ones' senses.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.942
Why?

22:24.042 --> 22:26.150
You'd be surprised
what you can do

22:26.250 --> 22:30.025
with a set of eyes,
a pair of ears, a voice.

22:30.125 --> 22:33.899
You might even be able to trick
an infant into believing

22:33.999 --> 22:35.859
you're one of the family.

22:35.959 --> 22:37.584
Now...

22:39.125 --> 22:41.609
...let's see that

22:41.709 --> 22:45.275
beautiful baby boy.

22:45.375 --> 22:48.067
Okay, little guy,
what is it? What is it?

22:48.167 --> 22:51.900
Do we need a diaper change?
No, not that.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.651
Okay, how about
the popcorn machine?

22:55.751 --> 22:58.899
That always works for Daddy,
right? Right? Okay, here we go.

22:58.999 --> 23:01.899
Pop, pop, pop, pop...

23:01.999 --> 23:04.150
No popping.
Okay, forget the popping.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.359
Okay, it's all right. Hello?

23:07.459 --> 23:08.983
Leo?

23:09.083 --> 23:11.899
Yeah, just came
to check on you.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.150
How did you know it was me?

23:13.250 --> 23:17.899
Well, you shuffle your feet.
You're a shuffler.

23:17.999 --> 23:20.859
Looks like your other
senses are already taking
over for your vision.

23:20.959 --> 23:22.192
Not fast enough.

23:22.292 --> 23:24.899
Okay, tell me what
I'm doing wrong here.

23:24.999 --> 23:27.692
That fussy noise
usually means gas.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.776
Try putting him
over your shoulder.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.651
Okay.

23:31.751 --> 23:34.818
Alrighty, here we go.
Oh, now.

23:34.918 --> 23:37.150
- Better?
- No, not better.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.651
I don't know all his tricks
and noises like you guys do.

23:40.751 --> 23:42.899
And at least before,
I could see him.

23:42.999 --> 23:45.876
Well, the love is there.
The rest will follow.

23:46.667 --> 23:48.401
You know, it's just a myth

23:48.501 --> 23:50.526
that all mothers instantly
bond with their children.

23:50.626 --> 23:52.567
Well, I'm not worried
about all other mothers.

23:52.667 --> 23:56.067
- I'm worried about this one.
- Well, from where I stand,
you look like a pro.

23:56.167 --> 24:00.609
- He's already calmed down.
- He has? Oh, he has.
Okay, good.

24:00.709 --> 24:04.025
PHOEBE: Leo, bring Piper up
here. I think we found
something.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.776
Here, take him.

24:05.876 --> 24:07.859
I don't want him left
alone for a second

24:07.959 --> 24:10.751
while all this stuff
is going on here, okay?

24:16.209 --> 24:18.542
[SQUEAKING]

24:39.999 --> 24:42.192
PHOEBE: The monkey didn't come
after us on his own.

24:42.292 --> 24:45.484
Someone very powerful
is behind all of this.

24:45.584 --> 24:46.899
The question is, who?

24:46.999 --> 24:50.167
Hello? Anybody in here?
Give me a sign.

24:51.999 --> 24:54.959
All right, speak and spell.
Tell me what you two know.

25:04.959 --> 25:07.609
Okay, listen to this. Centuries
ago, a sorcerer created a monkey

25:07.709 --> 25:11.025
to steal his enemies' senses.
Only the sorcerer mistreated the
little fella,

25:11.125 --> 25:13.359
so the monkey stole
his master's voice

25:13.459 --> 25:16.734
and was turned into a wooden
totem as punishment.

25:16.834 --> 25:19.150
So this whole monkey business
about, you know,

25:19.250 --> 25:22.651
speak no evil, hear no evil,
see no evil is a real thing?

25:22.751 --> 25:24.067
What?

25:24.167 --> 25:26.609
Never mind. Read my lips.

25:26.709 --> 25:28.734
Is there anything in here

25:28.834 --> 25:31.942
that will get
our senses back?

25:32.042 --> 25:34.567
Piper, I can't hear you!

25:34.667 --> 25:35.999
What do we do?

25:40.834 --> 25:42.859
Paige is proposing violence
against the monkey.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.692
Well, I'm inclined to agree,

25:44.792 --> 25:47.899
but I really think the monkey
is the least of our worries.

25:47.999 --> 25:50.067
Yeah, I didn't hear
what you just said.

25:50.167 --> 25:51.900
But if you're wondering
who's behind this,

25:52.000 --> 25:53.542
I was about to
look in the Book.

25:54.417 --> 25:56.692
Oh.

25:56.792 --> 26:00.192
Oh, no, it's Elise.
Piper, you're the only
one that can talk to her.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.651
Tell her I'm sick.

40:45.999 --> 40:48.899
that I didn't ask myself
what I wanted.

40:48.999 --> 40:51.609
Which would be what?

40:51.709 --> 40:53.109
To spend time with my family.

40:53.209 --> 40:55.899
Yay! Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

40:55.999 --> 40:57.692
To ride rides with my nephew

40:57.792 --> 41:00.234
and to not be one of those
annoying cell-phone people

41:00.334 --> 41:01.899
that the mimes make fun of.

41:01.999 --> 41:03.899
So, what are you
gonna tell Jason?

41:03.999 --> 41:07.942
Mmm. I'm gonna tell him exactly
what I just told you.

41:08.042 --> 41:11.818
And as my boss,
he's not gonna like it.

41:11.918 --> 41:13.818
But as my boyfriend,

41:13.918 --> 41:16.609
there are ways
of bringing him around.

41:16.709 --> 41:17.942
We do have ways.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.834
Mm-hm.

41:23.250 --> 41:25.942
I was supposed to sing a song
for Bobby Maynard,

41:26.042 --> 41:28.734
but he didn't inspire me much.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.250
So, Nate Parks...

41:31.999 --> 41:34.000
...this one's for you.

41:51.042 --> 41:54.459
âª Never know
how much I love you âª

41:55.834 --> 41:59.751
âª Never know how much I care âª

42:01.000 --> 42:05.401
âª When you put
your arms around me âª

42:05.501 --> 42:09.692
âª I get a fever
that's so hard to bear âª

42:09.792 --> 42:12.167
âª You give me fever âª

42:14.626 --> 42:20.083
âª When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight âª

42:21.999 --> 42:24.109
âª Fever âª

42:24.209 --> 42:26.734
âª In the morning âª

42:26.834 --> 42:30.651
âª And fever
all through the night âª

42:30.751 --> 42:35.567
âª Now you've listened
to my story âª

42:35.667 --> 42:39.209
âª Here's the point
that I have made âª

42:40.918 --> 42:42.209
âª Fever âª

42:43.167 --> 42:45.692
âª Till you sizzle âª

42:45.792 --> 42:49.417
âª What a lovely way to burn âª

42:50.999 --> 42:54.667
âª What a lovely way to burn âª

42:56.250 --> 42:59.626
âª What a lovely way to burn âª

43:01.709 --> 43:07.667
âª What a lovely way to burn âªâª
