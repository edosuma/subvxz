00:45.130 --> 00:46.131
<i>The Vampire and Lycan...</i>

00:46.297 --> 00:47.424
<i>...clans had been at war...</i>

00:47.716 --> 00:49.259
<i>...for centuries before I was born...</i>

00:51.219 --> 00:51.928
<i>...their conflict...</i>

00:52.137 --> 00:52.804
<i>...hidden from...</i>

00:53.012 --> 00:53.680
<i>...the human world.</i>

00:55.807 --> 00:56.558
<i>I was turned...</i>

00:56.725 --> 00:57.642
<i>...by a Vampire.</i>

01:01.438 --> 01:02.105
<i>Given the strength...</i>

01:02.272 --> 01:02.939
<i>...to avenge...</i>

01:03.106 --> 01:03.773
<i>...rny family...</i>

01:03.940 --> 01:04.649
<i>...against the Lycans.</i>

01:11.448 --> 01:12.782
<i>And I was good at it.</i>

01:21.666 --> 01:23.626
<i>Then I found Michael Corvin...</i>

01:26.963 --> 01:27.839
<i>...a human that was...</i>

01:28.006 --> 01:29.466
<i>...turned to neither Vampire...</i>

01:29.632 --> 01:30.341
<i>...nor Lycan...</i>

01:32.093 --> 01:32.761
<i>...but a hybrid...</i>

01:32.927 --> 01:34.137
<i>...of the two.</i>

01:34.304 --> 01:35.263
<i>Everything changed.</i>

01:38.641 --> 01:39.517
<i>Allies turned...</i>

01:39.684 --> 01:40.518
<i>...enemies...</i>

01:40.810 --> 01:42.395
<i>...and the Vampire elders I had...</i>

01:42.562 --> 01:44.355
<i>protected for over six centuries...</i>

01:45.315 --> 01:45.982
<i>...wanted me dead.</i>

01:48.318 --> 01:49.611
<i>We retaliated...</i>

01:51.821 --> 01:52.947
<i>...killed the elders...</i>

01:54.365 --> 01:55.325
<i>...and for a moment of time...</i>

01:56.367 --> 01:57.160
<i>...we were safe.</i>

02:01.956 --> 02:02.791
<i>But then...</i>

02:04.125 --> 02:05.919
<i>...a new darkness arose.</i>

02:08.170 --> 02:08.922
<i>In the nine days...</i>

02:09.130 --> 02:11.841
<i>...since the first discovery
of the non-human species...</i>

02:12.008 --> 02:14.052
<i>...scores of so-called "covens"
have been uncovered.</i>

02:15.220 --> 02:17.639
<i>Estimates of the number
of infected have skyrocketed.</i>

02:17.931 --> 02:18.848
<i>Military sources confirm...</i>

02:19.808 --> 02:20.517
<i>...that the primary measures...</i>

02:20.683 --> 02:23.102
<i>...of defense
against the non-humans are...</i>

02:23.269 --> 02:24.979
<i>...ultra violet light and silver...</i>

02:25.146 --> 02:28.066
<i>...to which the infected
appear to have fatal sensitivity.</i>

02:28.733 --> 02:31.319
<i>Tents are posted at every
barricade throughout the city.</i>

02:32.779 --> 02:33.822
<i>A test will be administered...</i>

02:33.988 --> 02:34.656
<i>...to verify...</i>

02:34.823 --> 02:36.282
<i>...if you're clear of infection.</i>

02:36.741 --> 02:37.909
Spray her!

02:38.076 --> 02:38.910
Spray her with silver!

02:42.622 --> 02:44.666
- Get it out here!
- Help! Run!

02:44.874 --> 02:45.625
No, no! Run!

02:52.674 --> 02:54.384
<i>We've begun our second
attack wave...</i>

02:54.592 --> 02:55.718
<i>...using ultraviolet...</i>

02:55.885 --> 02:56.719
<i>...and silver-nitrate...</i>

02:56.886 --> 02:58.096
<i>...munitions, which</i> are...

02:58.263 --> 02:59.472
<i>...deadly to the infected.</i>

02:59.639 --> 03:00.765
<i>Due to the volatile...</i>

03:00.932 --> 03:01.724
<i>...situation...</i>

03:01.891 --> 03:04.853
<i>...martial law was declared
two hours ago.</i>

03:08.022 --> 03:08.898
<i>Many of us have...</i>

03:09.065 --> 03:10.733
<i>...lost loved ones to this.</i>

03:15.071 --> 03:18.950
<i>Please know that you cannot
help them or yourself.</i>

03:19.409 --> 03:20.159
<i>It's shocking...</i>

03:20.326 --> 03:21.160
<i>...that not one...</i>

03:21.327 --> 03:22.245
<i>...but two distinct...</i>

03:22.412 --> 03:25.373
<i>...species may have been
coexisting within human populations.</i>

03:26.541 --> 03:28.585
<i>The existence
of Vampires and Werewolves...</i>

03:29.002 --> 03:31.254
<i>...now appear to have
actual basis in fact.</i>

03:31.921 --> 03:33.923
<i>The city remains reluctant
to share new...</i>

03:34.090 --> 03:34.883
 <i>...information.</i>

03:35.383 --> 03:38.344
<i>We are getting reports on what
appears to be a mass cleansing.</i>

03:38.511 --> 03:39.596
Fire!

03:41.514 --> 03:42.557
Get back! No cameras!

03:43.433 --> 03:45.268
<i>There's no cure.</i>

03:50.440 --> 03:51.691
There it is!

03:52.442 --> 03:53.192
Engage contact!

03:53.818 --> 03:54.485
Man down!

03:54.652 --> 03:55.820
- Man down!
- Cover me!

04:31.314 --> 04:32.649
<i>The Purge.</i>

04:33.149 --> 04:36.110
<i>Human beings no longer
kill each other.</i>

04:37.320 --> 04:40.114
<i>We are the enemy
they've been waiting for.</i>

04:41.616 --> 04:44.827
<i>Escape has become
our only chance of survival.</i>

04:46.245 --> 04:46.955
<i>Therefore...</i>

04:47.121 --> 04:49.499
<i>...Michael and I are leaving tonight.</i>

04:53.836 --> 04:54.504
Halt!

04:59.008 --> 04:59.884
<i>Delta 6 in pursuit!</i>

05:29.372 --> 05:31.249
Stop! Get down on the ground!

06:04.490 --> 06:05.700
She'll be here any minute.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.535
- You be ready to go.
- Better hurry.

06:11.914 --> 06:14.042
<i>Tango Unit moving into position.</i>

06:16.711 --> 06:18.046
<i>We have the hybrid in sight.</i>

06:18.212 --> 06:20.256
<i>Hold your fire. Leave this one alive.</i>

06:26.220 --> 06:27.597
<i>Delta in position</i>

06:27.764 --> 06:28.723
<i>- Watch your flank.</i>
- Secure.

06:28.890 --> 06:29.682
Move, move, move!

06:30.016 --> 06:32.018
<i>Alpha Unit in position.</i>

06:36.230 --> 06:37.440
<i>Arming silver grenade!</i>

06:39.567 --> 06:40.443
Michael!

06:40.860 --> 06:41.861
<i>Fire!</i>

06:53.790 --> 06:55.083
<i>- Move in!
- Alpha 4, move in.</i>

06:56.250 --> 06:57.752
<i>Grenades, fire!</i>

07:38.501 --> 07:40.128
<i>Retrieve the bodies.</i>

07:58.521 --> 08:02.441
<i>Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.</i>

08:02.608 --> 08:04.402
<i>Subject 2 has escaped.</i>

08:04.569 --> 08:06.487
<i>Security units on alert.</i>

08:07.405 --> 08:10.575
<i>Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.</i>

08:10.867 --> 08:14.620
<i>Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.</i>

08:15.246 --> 08:16.998
<i>Subject 2 has escaped.</i>

08:17.165 --> 08:18.875
<i>Security units on alert.</i>

08:19.041 --> 08:20.042
<i>Subject 2...</i>

08:20.251 --> 08:22.336
<i>...has escaped.
Security units on alert.</i>

08:23.629 --> 08:25.548
<i>Defrost sequence initiated.</i>

08:25.715 --> 08:26.757
<i>Lowering compression...</i>

08:26.924 --> 08:28.342
<i>...in Subject 1 cryo-chamber.</i>

08:34.307 --> 08:35.057
Look out!

08:35.265 --> 08:36.225
<i>Defrost sequence...</i>

08:36.392 --> 08:37.643
<i>...complete.</i>

08:37.809 --> 08:39.854
- Subject 2! Get it!
- Over there...

08:40.020 --> 08:42.273
...by the chamber!
Don't let it get away!

09:42.667 --> 09:44.710
<i>Security violation, Level 6.</i>

09:44.877 --> 09:47.213
<i>All containment personnel to Level 6.</i>

10:07.441 --> 10:08.442
Jacob.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.611
Subject 2 escaped,
it's in the building.

10:13.698 --> 10:15.783
We've got Subject 1
in full lockdown.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.120
- Give me the status.
- Subject 1 has broken free.

10:19.287 --> 10:22.748
- We need to flash-burn immediately.
- No, wait. Let me see.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.750
Open it.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.220
Put it back to sleep.

10:38.681 --> 10:39.890
Hurry.

10:42.476 --> 10:43.394
<i>Releasing...</i>

10:43.561 --> 10:45.479
<i>...maximum dose of fentanyl.</i>

11:07.376 --> 11:08.878
What is this place?

11:10.713 --> 11:11.547
Where's Michael?

11:15.968 --> 11:17.303
No, no, no. No, no, no.

11:33.319 --> 11:35.237
All non-security personnel...

11:35.404 --> 11:36.572
...clear the building!

11:36.739 --> 11:38.616
Security command, outside now!

11:43.746 --> 11:45.539
- There she is!
- Stop!

11:45.706 --> 11:47.041
Don't move!

11:58.260 --> 12:01.055
Multiple casualties on Level 6!
Medical to alert status!

12:01.222 --> 12:02.098
Prepare for full...

12:02.264 --> 12:04.100
<i>...containment on Level 6!</i>

12:04.600 --> 12:06.018
<i>I repeat, full containment...</i>

12:06.185 --> 12:07.436
<i>...on Level 6!</i>

12:27.623 --> 12:28.457
I see her.

12:28.624 --> 12:29.458
East corridor. Send security.

12:29.625 --> 12:30.668
<i>No. Let her go.</i>

12:30.835 --> 12:31.627
<i>She'll lead us...</i>

12:31.794 --> 12:32.586
<i>...to Subject 2.</i>

12:32.753 --> 12:33.796
No, don't shoot!

12:35.005 --> 12:35.673
Let her go.

13:05.828 --> 13:06.996
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

13:07.163 --> 13:09.999
<i>Subject 1 and Subject 2
have escaped the perimeter...</i>

13:10.166 --> 13:12.835
<i>...and are no longer
under Antigen control.</i>

13:13.002 --> 13:16.755
<i>Secure the outer gates and use
extreme caution upon encounter.</i>

13:16.922 --> 13:20.301
<i>Report immediately upon
coming into contact...</i>

14:56.438 --> 14:58.315
Hey, how did you get in there?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.734
You're not allowed in here.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.028
The pier is closed.

15:03.654 --> 15:04.947
Since when?

15:05.531 --> 15:08.284
A long time ago. Come on.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.494
How long?

15:12.871 --> 15:14.832
About 12 years ago.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.419
Since the cleansing. Why?

15:19.128 --> 15:20.296
You okay, ma'am?

15:20.462 --> 15:22.298
<i>Attention, all units, code three call.</i>

15:22.464 --> 15:25.259
<i>Receiving a report of an assault,
Exit 39 underpass.</i>

15:25.926 --> 15:29.638
<i>Possible non-human aggressor.
Proceed with caution.</i>

15:29.805 --> 15:32.391
<i>CDC already en route.
All area units respond.</i>

15:34.852 --> 15:36.979
Ma'am? Hey!

15:37.187 --> 15:38.314
Ma'am?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.178
- What are you doing?
- Stay there! Don't move!

16:09.345 --> 16:11.513
- Identify yourself!
- Get back here right now!

16:30.699 --> 16:33.285
Whoever it is,
they couldn't have made it very far.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.037
I'll alert CDC to keep an eye out.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.330
They're en route.

16:36.497 --> 16:39.500
- There's no way this attack was human.
- You don't know that.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.252
Don't know what?

16:42.503 --> 16:44.213
The guy's shredded.
His throat was...

16:44.380 --> 16:46.382
- ...in the gutter.
- Just let me handle it.

16:46.548 --> 16:49.051
What's to handle?
This has Lycan written all over it.

16:49.218 --> 16:49.885
Detective...

16:50.052 --> 16:53.555
...when was the last time you heard
about a reported Lycan killing?

16:54.640 --> 16:55.724
A couple years ago.

16:55.891 --> 16:58.227
How many years
have you been with this department?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.729
What? I've been here
for three months.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.272
Exactly.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.901
You question me less
until you know a bit more.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.319
- We clear?
- Crystal.

17:11.699 --> 17:13.075
Detective Sebastian.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.243
<i>Detective, we've just
received a report.</i>

17:15.411 --> 17:17.413
<i>There's been a disturbance
at Antigen Labs.</i>

17:17.579 --> 17:19.205
<i>A witness says
there was an escape.</i>

17:19.373 --> 17:20.915
<i>They said someone jumped...</i>

17:21.083 --> 17:23.252
<i>...out of a window.
This is a priority...</i>

17:23.419 --> 17:24.420
<i>...investigation.</i>

17:24.586 --> 17:26.088
<i>We need you over there ASAP.</i>

17:26.255 --> 17:27.756
We're on our way.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.175
Hey, let's go.
Johnson, you're the lead.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.094
You got it, detective. Will do.

17:48.527 --> 17:49.903
Who's in charge?

17:51.822 --> 17:55.784
There's a Detective Sebastian
here to see you, sir.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.413
Where is he?

17:59.580 --> 18:01.623
In the lobby, sir.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.712
<i>You'll be relieved to know...</i>

18:06.879 --> 18:08.714
...the situation is well under control.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.216
- What happened?
- I repeat, well under control.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.051
I repeat, what happened?

18:13.552 --> 18:16.889
Yes, there are reports to be filed.

18:17.556 --> 18:22.186
One of our test subjects attempted to
escape. We were forced to put it down.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.938
- So nothing got out?
- Only a stray bullet.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.775
- And the test subject?
- Flash-burned.

18:28.066 --> 18:28.984
Will that be all?

18:29.568 --> 18:31.945
A few things to attend to.
You could imagine.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.323
Doctor, we received
an anonymous call...

18:34.490 --> 18:36.825
...that something else
escaped through a window.

18:36.992 --> 18:40.788
Detective, our mission at Antigen
is to develop ways of preventing...

18:40.954 --> 18:44.750
...infection, not releasing it
into the general population.

18:45.417 --> 18:48.003
I lost my son to this disease.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.548
There's no room for error with me
when it comes to the safety of...

18:51.715 --> 18:54.051
...the public.
If something had escaped...

18:54.218 --> 18:56.345
...the authorities
would have been notified.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.138
You are an authority, are you not?

18:59.932 --> 19:01.850
Now, if you'll excuse me...

19:25.499 --> 19:28.877
The guy in charge says it's nothing.
Let's go.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.880
Yeah, and he's full of shit.
Look at this.

19:33.549 --> 19:34.883
Want me to report it, sir?

19:35.092 --> 19:36.635
No. I'll do it.

19:36.802 --> 19:38.971
I don't mind. I can do it for you.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.891
All right, sir.

20:06.540 --> 20:10.586
The prisoner that helped me escape,
the one you called Subject 2...

20:11.837 --> 20:12.921
...was it a hybrid?

20:14.339 --> 20:15.382
Yes.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.092
What were you doing with us?

20:18.010 --> 20:19.177
We...

20:19.887 --> 20:22.764
We help the government
identify the infected.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.601
We were using your DNA
to try to find a cure...

20:25.767 --> 20:28.061
...to prevent another outbreak.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.813
You were told that I would...

20:29.980 --> 20:31.773
...lead you to the hybrid. Why?

20:32.608 --> 20:35.319
Subject 2 is restricted information.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.112
I don't have the clearance.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.239
You're lying.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.658
No!

20:43.035 --> 20:44.411
No, please!

20:44.578 --> 20:45.412
All I know is...

20:45.579 --> 20:47.122
...there's a connection between you.

20:47.789 --> 20:48.790
Your brain waves...

20:48.957 --> 20:50.751
...fall into sync
when you're close...

20:50.918 --> 20:51.793
...to each other.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.211
You can see through
each other's eyes!

20:55.422 --> 20:56.423
Please don't!

20:56.590 --> 20:58.091
I'm the one who let you go!

20:58.634 --> 21:00.135
Now we're even.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.628
What the hell was that?

21:35.295 --> 21:37.005
Creepy is what.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.924
- I'm calling it in.
- Let's go.

22:28.056 --> 22:28.724
Shit.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.027
Don't.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.278
Why not?

22:41.778 --> 22:43.196
We're the same.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.201
Why are you following me?

22:48.368 --> 22:50.078
We monitor the police frequencies.

22:50.787 --> 22:51.788
Well?

22:51.955 --> 22:54.750
Do you know what attacked
that human under the bridge?

22:55.584 --> 22:56.877
No.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.715
Lycans.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.091
What remains of them, yes.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.763
They've been hiding
down here like rats...

23:07.929 --> 23:08.847
...since the Purge.

23:09.014 --> 23:12.267
Diseased and starving, they rarely
show themselves above ground.

23:12.642 --> 23:15.187
Which means that something
has got them riled up.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.440
Something you're not telling me.

23:34.331 --> 23:35.082
Michael!

24:17.958 --> 24:19.751
Do you know her?

24:19.918 --> 24:21.169
No.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.344
They will come back in numbers.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.597
We can't leave her here.

24:37.769 --> 24:38.520
Come on.

24:50.866 --> 24:52.159
Let's try the van.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.291
Get in. Move! Move!

25:17.058 --> 25:18.518
Three of them behind us.

26:30.548 --> 26:31.216
Go!

26:34.970 --> 26:35.679
Hurry, Selene!

26:35.845 --> 26:37.013
They're getting in the back!

26:44.980 --> 26:46.815
Fucking piece of shit!

26:54.406 --> 26:55.782
The girl! They're taking her!

27:31.192 --> 27:32.610
You drive.

28:19.282 --> 28:20.950
She's not healing.

28:21.117 --> 28:23.536
We have a doctor that can help her
at our coven.

28:25.038 --> 28:25.747
How did you...

28:25.914 --> 28:27.123
...find me?

28:29.459 --> 28:30.794
What's your name?

28:31.544 --> 28:33.254
Subject 2.

28:33.421 --> 28:36.216
And you are Subject 1.

28:37.175 --> 28:39.219
I freed you.

28:41.429 --> 28:43.556
Do you not know who I am?

28:44.974 --> 28:47.769
They told me that I had no mother...

28:47.936 --> 28:50.146
...that she died when I was born.

28:51.648 --> 28:53.775
I never believed it. I...

28:54.275 --> 28:56.486
I felt you.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.905
Saw images through your eyes.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.117
But then someone outside my door...

29:03.243 --> 29:07.455
...they said since I was no longer
a child, the wait was over...

29:09.165 --> 29:10.750
...that I'd be dead soon.

29:11.418 --> 29:14.295
And that my own mother,
right next door...

29:14.796 --> 29:17.507
...would never even know I'd existed.

29:19.384 --> 29:21.636
What did they tell you of your father?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.472
They must have told you something.

29:24.639 --> 29:26.683
Do you see images through him?

29:27.142 --> 29:28.393
No.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.145
Only you.

29:35.066 --> 29:35.984
No, please!

29:48.121 --> 29:50.165
<i>She's never stepped foot
outside the lab.</i>

29:50.331 --> 29:51.833
How can she possibly survive?

29:52.000 --> 29:55.003
I understand the risk of reporting
her escape to the authorities.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.296
No record of her birth.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.798
Questions will be asked.
I'm well aware of that.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.050
But if she dies,
all our years of research--

30:01.217 --> 30:02.844
Rather than tell me
how to do my job...

30:03.011 --> 30:06.014
...why not take a look
at your own professional conduct?

30:06.181 --> 30:08.850
And how your continual need
to endow this creature...

30:09.017 --> 30:13.021
...with human traits has led to
the laxness of its security protocols.

30:13.188 --> 30:15.857
It's not a human being, Lida!
It's not your child.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.192
It's not to be coddled.

30:17.358 --> 30:19.360
It's a blight of nature.

30:23.072 --> 30:25.325
Stop worrying. It'll come back to us.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.669
Get Olivia at once.

32:04.465 --> 32:07.135
Again you break my rules. Why?

32:07.302 --> 32:09.429
She was attacked.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.014
She is not healing.

32:11.180 --> 32:13.600
And for this
you compromise our safety?

32:13.766 --> 32:14.517
You have...

32:14.684 --> 32:16.811
...no reason to fear us.

32:18.813 --> 32:21.816
Do you think I'm foolish enough
to take you at your word?

32:23.318 --> 32:24.193
No reason...

32:24.360 --> 32:27.155
...to fear a Death Dealer
who fell in love with a Lycan...

32:27.322 --> 32:29.365
...who murdered two of our elders...

32:29.782 --> 32:31.868
...and who, at every turn,
has betrayed...

32:32.035 --> 32:33.328
...her own kind.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.206
Do you know who this is?

32:39.375 --> 32:40.043
Yes.

32:41.836 --> 32:43.880
But it was we
who betrayed her, Father.

32:45.757 --> 32:46.924
Let her through.

32:49.344 --> 32:50.803
She's not healing.

33:01.689 --> 33:03.775
She was attacked by a lower Lycan.

33:04.651 --> 33:05.652
Two hours ago.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.198
Her cell repair is...

33:10.698 --> 33:13.701
...active but weakened.

33:16.621 --> 33:17.705
She has no...

33:18.831 --> 33:20.500
...origin bite marks...

33:21.584 --> 33:23.127
...or scars.

33:24.796 --> 33:27.090
I've never seen a child like this before.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.884
When did you last feed?

33:30.259 --> 33:31.552
Feed?

33:32.929 --> 33:34.514
Give her blood.

33:43.231 --> 33:44.023
Child...

33:44.190 --> 33:45.566
...you must.

34:03.626 --> 34:04.919
Slowly.

34:05.628 --> 34:07.088
Slowly.

34:09.924 --> 34:10.925
There.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.761
There, now.

34:17.974 --> 34:19.516
She's healing.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.438
- And quickly.
- Good.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.440
Take her to my room.
She needs to rest.

34:25.606 --> 34:26.607
No.

34:27.942 --> 34:29.277
Look at the eyes.

34:39.579 --> 34:41.664
I never believed it.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.666
They do exist.

34:45.042 --> 34:47.420
This is not one of us.

34:47.587 --> 34:50.005
No, it's something more, Father.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.594
What do you know of her?

34:57.180 --> 35:00.057
I was held captive
at a place called Antigen.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.895
One of the other prisoners freed me.

35:04.645 --> 35:06.314
I believed it was Michael Corvin...

35:06.481 --> 35:08.983
...the only hybrid I knew
existed at that time.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.194
Yes, yes, your Lycan lover, long dead.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.029
What is this, then?

35:14.655 --> 35:16.365
None of your concern.

35:17.074 --> 35:19.869
As soon as she regains her strength,
I will leave with her.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.408
I used to hear stories...

35:59.575 --> 36:00.910
...of the Death Dealers.

36:02.203 --> 36:05.748
That they were a thing of the past...

36:05.915 --> 36:07.792
...never to return.

36:09.252 --> 36:11.045
I'm glad they were wrong.

36:12.713 --> 36:14.549
You knew who I am...

36:16.551 --> 36:18.719
...and yet you still brought me here.

36:21.055 --> 36:22.682
Thank you.

36:22.849 --> 36:24.642
You're a fighter.

36:25.017 --> 36:27.520
We could use more like you
to teach us.

36:27.687 --> 36:28.437
I'm not sure...

36:28.604 --> 36:30.022
...your father would agree.

36:30.189 --> 36:33.901
There was a time when he would have.
That's why he dislikes you so much.

36:34.068 --> 36:38.322
I think it reminds him of the days when
he defended us with fire and steel...

36:38.489 --> 36:42.034
...rather than hollow words.
He knows how much we need you.

36:43.578 --> 36:46.581
- I'm not a leader.
- But you fight for what you believe in.

36:47.582 --> 36:48.749
You always have.

36:48.916 --> 36:49.792
I don't know...

36:49.959 --> 36:51.335
...what I believe in any more.

36:51.502 --> 36:54.046
I don't recognise this world.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.090
But you haven't changed.

36:56.757 --> 36:59.260
I saw it in your eyes
when you looked at the child.

37:00.177 --> 37:02.680
You will protect her.

37:02.847 --> 37:04.140
It's in your blood.

37:04.307 --> 37:05.892
It's who you are.

37:07.476 --> 37:09.937
When you leave, take me with you.

38:14.377 --> 38:16.295
You distrust me.

38:22.802 --> 38:26.013
Of course you do.
I made you feel unwelcome.

38:26.180 --> 38:28.265
And for that, I'm sorry.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.772
Those eyes...

38:35.690 --> 38:37.358
...they're special.

38:39.151 --> 38:42.738
I know exactly what you are.

38:54.917 --> 38:56.085
<i>My father says that...</i>

38:56.252 --> 38:59.672
...should we survive as a species,
these relics will help...

38:59.839 --> 39:02.383
...our descendants know
who we were and how we lived.

39:02.550 --> 39:04.176
And what do you say?

39:04.343 --> 39:06.721
That if we continue to live
as we do now...

39:06.887 --> 39:09.724
...then we disgrace the past
and don't deserve a future.

39:09.890 --> 39:12.226
We must resist the humans...

39:12.893 --> 39:14.854
...wherever and whenever possible.

39:15.021 --> 39:17.189
Between the first and second Purges...

39:17.898 --> 39:22.570
...Lycan youth rallied in the same way
against the prudence of their elders.

39:22.737 --> 39:26.282
Their calls for violent action
carried the day.

39:26.449 --> 39:27.950
The result?

39:28.159 --> 39:30.995
The Werewolves are nearly extinct.

39:31.871 --> 39:34.874
Is that what you wish for us,
extinction?

39:35.499 --> 39:36.625
Yet you bring...

39:36.792 --> 39:39.086
...her offspring into our home.
Do you honestly...

39:39.253 --> 39:42.214
...believe the humans
will allow her to remain free?

39:42.548 --> 39:44.467
They will hunt her down
at any expense.

39:44.633 --> 39:47.553
- Then we can help protect them.
- Protect them?

39:48.220 --> 39:49.930
They leave tonight.

39:50.264 --> 39:50.931
This isn't...

39:51.098 --> 39:51.766
...prudence.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.809
This is cowardice, plain and simple.

39:55.811 --> 39:57.688
How dare you?

39:58.439 --> 40:00.107
How dare you...

40:01.275 --> 40:02.443
...do so little?

40:33.724 --> 40:36.102
I dreamt of the day we would meet.

40:38.979 --> 40:41.273
Like a silly little girl.

40:47.613 --> 40:50.407
You're as cold as one already dead.

40:54.954 --> 40:56.497
Yesterday...

40:57.123 --> 40:59.291
...I was with your father.

41:02.294 --> 41:05.756
He was only a little further away
from me than you are now.

41:08.092 --> 41:09.802
I went to sleep.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.806
And when I awoke the next day...

41:15.224 --> 41:17.101
...I learned that, overnight...

41:18.310 --> 41:20.521
...12 years had passed.

41:22.231 --> 41:25.359
And instead of the only man
I've ever loved...

41:26.777 --> 41:29.196
...there stood a girl with his eyes.

41:33.784 --> 41:36.078
My heart is not cold.

41:36.245 --> 41:37.913
It's broken.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.752
I'm so sorry.

41:54.180 --> 41:55.431
What is it?

41:57.641 --> 41:58.726
They're here.

41:59.894 --> 42:02.271
Stay here. Wait for me.

42:02.438 --> 42:03.898
No, take me with you.

42:04.064 --> 42:05.232
Please.

42:05.399 --> 42:08.736
I won't let anyone hurt you. I promise.

42:08.903 --> 42:09.945
Lock the door.

42:11.947 --> 42:14.033
Everybody to the shelter. Now!

42:15.743 --> 42:16.952
No!

42:17.119 --> 42:19.079
Prepare the armory.

42:19.246 --> 42:21.332
Do as I say! Go, 90!

42:22.416 --> 42:24.752
Pay heed to me!

42:24.919 --> 42:28.088
No! We stand and we fight.

42:43.938 --> 42:46.440
No! Have you no sense?

42:50.694 --> 42:51.612
Stop this now!

42:53.030 --> 42:56.116
We lived safely for years
and you brought humans into this coven.

42:56.533 --> 42:57.451
They want the girl.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.286
They'll stop at nothing
to get her.

42:59.453 --> 43:02.331
This day was bound to come,
with or without us.

43:02.498 --> 43:05.084
Let's move!
Munitions, let's go! Everyone!

43:05.251 --> 43:06.502
Are you mad?

43:06.669 --> 43:09.964
We have no more than a handful
of fighters. We will be annihilated!

43:10.923 --> 43:12.383
And what's your plan, Father?

43:12.549 --> 43:14.134
Let's go! Now!

43:15.761 --> 43:18.305
- Where are you going?
- To get her away from here.

43:18.472 --> 43:21.183
- He's right. I shouldn't have come.
- He doesn't understand.

43:21.350 --> 43:23.894
The humans will follow us out.
Hold them off till then.

43:25.062 --> 43:26.313
They're only here for her.

43:27.481 --> 43:29.316
She's more powerful than any of us.

43:29.483 --> 43:31.151
They fear the day she discovers it.

43:32.319 --> 43:34.029
I have to get her out of here.

44:11.942 --> 44:13.652
Lycan!

44:17.698 --> 44:19.074
Silver ammunition!

44:19.241 --> 44:20.075
Now!

44:20.492 --> 44:21.452
Defend the second...

44:21.618 --> 44:22.286
...rotunda!

44:22.453 --> 44:23.746
Move! Move!

45:08.040 --> 45:09.416
Open the door!

45:11.502 --> 45:12.252
Let's go.

45:36.276 --> 45:37.569
Move! Move!

46:17.985 --> 46:19.236
We need to go.

46:44.845 --> 46:46.013
What the hell was that?

46:49.558 --> 46:51.685
- Take her somewhere safe.
- No.

46:51.852 --> 46:53.312
Take her. Go.

49:35.223 --> 49:36.725
Where is she?

49:37.184 --> 49:38.685
They took her.

49:39.686 --> 49:41.521
They accepted her.

49:43.231 --> 49:45.317
As a gift from me.

50:25.065 --> 50:26.400
Do you know what you've done?

50:27.776 --> 50:28.985
Do you have any idea?

50:29.152 --> 50:31.405
What would you have had me do?

50:31.613 --> 50:35.867
Fight to the last to protect
the very one who brought this upon us?

50:36.451 --> 50:37.411
We're defeated.

50:38.412 --> 50:40.455
Our coven is destroyed.
My son...

50:40.622 --> 50:41.456
...is dead.

50:41.915 --> 50:43.542
Because of you.

50:44.626 --> 50:45.794
Why?

50:47.421 --> 50:48.714
Because he helped that...

50:48.880 --> 50:50.507
...child of yours.

50:50.674 --> 50:52.759
If they kill her, so be it.

50:52.926 --> 50:56.263
Your son died because
he was fighting for all of you.

50:57.931 --> 51:00.100
Because he knew that running
is not survival.

51:01.977 --> 51:03.562
Those were Lycans.

51:03.729 --> 51:06.815
Not extinct. More powerful than ever.

51:07.190 --> 51:10.110
That thing was more than twice the size
of any Lycan I've seen.

51:11.903 --> 51:12.779
They risked...

51:12.946 --> 51:17.075
...showing themselves after more than
a decade in hiding because of her.

51:17.242 --> 51:19.536
And you handed her over to them.

51:21.455 --> 51:22.456
She is the last...

51:22.622 --> 51:26.626
...direct descendant
of Alexander Corvinus.

51:27.252 --> 51:30.505
The only hybrid child
that has ever existed.

51:32.966 --> 51:35.385
Whatever it is the Lycans
want from her...

51:36.428 --> 51:38.764
...your son knew it was
worth dying for.

51:45.729 --> 51:47.022
What are you doing?

52:16.510 --> 52:17.844
David.

53:32.085 --> 53:33.628
A force of two dozen Lycans...

53:33.795 --> 53:36.965
...attacked and destroyed
one of our covens last night.

53:38.925 --> 53:40.218
You're not surprised.

53:42.596 --> 53:44.264
You knew the Lycans
were not extinct.

53:45.223 --> 53:47.142
- How?
- Just a feeling.

53:47.601 --> 53:49.603
I'm not good with feelings.

53:49.769 --> 53:51.605
I want to know how.

53:51.855 --> 53:54.024
This is not the place for this.

53:54.858 --> 53:56.276
And you're not gonna kill me.

53:56.443 --> 53:57.444
Really?

53:57.611 --> 53:58.737
No.

53:58.904 --> 54:01.197
Because you wouldn't need
a fucking gun to do it.

54:04.117 --> 54:05.035
<i>A few years ago...</i>

54:05.201 --> 54:08.121
...the government declared
"mission accomplished" on Lycans.

54:08.288 --> 54:10.540
The feds announced that
we were to only focus...

54:10.707 --> 54:12.375
...on your kind now.

54:13.001 --> 54:15.837
Three months ago,
a friend of mine sent me this.

54:17.130 --> 54:20.759
It arrived two days after he was found
hanging from his own ceiling fan.

54:23.303 --> 54:25.430
Two hundred suspected
Lycan captures.

54:25.597 --> 54:27.140
Every case was investigated.

54:27.307 --> 54:29.476
Every blood test came back negative.

54:29.643 --> 54:30.936
My friend began to wonder:

54:31.102 --> 54:34.564
Were they all false leads or was
someone trying to protect the Lycans?

54:35.607 --> 54:38.318
Helping them replenish their packs,
letting them regroup.

54:38.526 --> 54:40.487
What about your own department?

54:43.281 --> 54:46.826
They have my daughter.
All I care about is getting her back.

54:48.536 --> 54:52.958
If you're protecting someone, I don't
care. I'm not after them. I just want her.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.542
No.

54:55.502 --> 54:59.422
Even if there are others in my
department, they don't have authority.

54:59.756 --> 55:01.299
This goes much higher.

55:02.050 --> 55:04.302
I believe, all the way to the top.

55:05.887 --> 55:06.846
Or to the bottom.

55:07.639 --> 55:08.682
What do you mean?

55:09.766 --> 55:11.893
Who administers the tests?

55:12.686 --> 55:16.147
We're a bit short on time,
so if you please, take a look at these.

55:17.023 --> 55:19.526
This schedule takes you
from the moment we adjourn...

55:19.693 --> 55:22.112
...through to the final manufacture
of the vaccine.

55:23.363 --> 55:27.534
If we stick to this plan, inoculations
should begin within three months.

55:27.701 --> 55:29.536
Any questions, now's the time.

55:29.703 --> 55:32.956
After today's surgery, there will be
no communication between us...

55:33.123 --> 55:35.375
...until we meet again
in the inoculation center.

55:35.583 --> 55:37.002
Doctor, in terms...

55:37.168 --> 55:38.503
...of your test subject...

55:38.670 --> 55:41.381
...he continues to demonstrate
immunity to silver?

55:41.548 --> 55:42.882
Absolutely.

55:43.216 --> 55:47.470
And additional inoculations,
administered only as a precaution...

55:47.637 --> 55:49.723
...triggered side effects
we never imagined.

55:50.098 --> 55:51.224
Vast increases...

55:51.391 --> 55:53.643
...in strength, muscle mass...

55:53.810 --> 55:55.478
...self-healing...

55:55.687 --> 55:56.813
...stamina.

55:58.982 --> 56:00.316
You said she was essential
to our research.

56:01.067 --> 56:03.570
- Yes, and will continue to be.
- How?

56:04.446 --> 56:05.947
By vivisecting her?

56:06.531 --> 56:08.116
You weren't meant to have that.

56:08.283 --> 56:09.909
I cared for this little girl...

56:10.493 --> 56:13.747
...all these years,
and you expect me to sit by...

56:14.247 --> 56:16.750
-...while you--
- Harvest its genetic material?

56:18.501 --> 56:20.211
I expect nothing from you.

56:21.171 --> 56:22.922
I hired you to look after it...

56:23.089 --> 56:26.426
...and for the most part,
you did an excellent job.

56:26.634 --> 56:28.762
Saving the lives of thousands.

56:29.804 --> 56:31.806
What are you talking about?

56:31.973 --> 56:34.434
An entire species
saved from extinction.

56:40.398 --> 56:41.566
Jacob.

57:26.486 --> 57:30.490
After today, you won't have to
wait so long between injections.

57:31.116 --> 57:33.159
Are you sure she's ready?

57:33.326 --> 57:35.078
Oestrogen levels high...

57:35.245 --> 57:38.331
...intervals between menses
holding steady.

57:38.540 --> 57:40.500
It's come of age.

57:41.251 --> 57:44.629
Everything's worked out
just as we'd hoped.

57:48.550 --> 57:50.552
You're the first proof of it.

57:52.387 --> 57:54.139
I'm proud of you, son.

57:58.893 --> 58:00.687
Now that it's with us again...

58:00.854 --> 58:04.023
...we'll have all the genetic material
we need, ready for cloning.

58:04.190 --> 58:07.694
Enough to produce
an endless supply of vaccine.

58:08.862 --> 58:09.737
Imagine.

58:10.321 --> 58:13.158
Our species immune to silver.

58:13.324 --> 58:14.993
No more hiding.

58:15.160 --> 58:18.621
Every Lycan under our command
as powerful as you are.

58:19.455 --> 58:22.041
I've even begun injecting myself.

58:22.709 --> 58:25.295
I only wish Mother
were here to see it.

58:26.045 --> 58:28.506
Your mother chose to
remain human.

58:30.300 --> 58:32.343
She abandoned us.

58:34.596 --> 58:36.347
Remember that.

58:50.403 --> 58:51.988
Of course, Father.

58:59.245 --> 58:59.913
Look...

59:00.079 --> 59:04.167
...if you're right about Antigen, who
knows how many Lycans will be there?

59:04.542 --> 59:07.253
The second you step foot inside,
you'll be surrounded.

59:07.420 --> 59:08.504
I'm hoping so.

59:11.090 --> 59:13.301
I know you want her back.
I can help you.

59:13.468 --> 59:16.095
- Why?
- Just tell me what your plan is.

59:40.745 --> 59:42.789
It's worse if you try to fight it.

59:43.957 --> 59:45.208
Trust me.

59:47.710 --> 59:49.295
So how is it you're actually...

59:49.462 --> 59:51.881
...able to survive in the sunlight?

59:53.800 --> 59:55.426
It was a gift.

59:56.427 --> 59:58.471
From a man named
Alexander Corvinus.

59:59.472 --> 01:00:00.848
The founding father.

01:00:04.811 --> 01:00:07.313
I used to be married, to a nurse.

01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:11.025
One day at work, she was bitten.

01:00:12.986 --> 01:00:16.990
Nobody knew but us.
We lived like that for a few years.

01:00:19.158 --> 01:00:20.827
Then came the Purge.

01:00:22.287 --> 01:00:26.040
The feds were conducting door-to-doors
and when they knocked on ours...

01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:34.465
...well, she told me she loved me...

01:00:36.342 --> 01:00:38.594
...and then she let the sunlight in.

01:00:39.929 --> 01:00:41.931
I had to watch her burn.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:05.079
Okay.

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:09.000
You got me?

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:10.918
Yes.

01:01:12.003 --> 01:01:13.379
Good luck.

01:01:28.227 --> 01:01:29.520
- Shit. It's her.
- In daylight?

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:30.355
It's her!

01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:31.439
- Go!
- Okay.

01:02:02.804 --> 01:02:03.763
Wait for my cue.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:04.722
I'm ready.

01:02:11.104 --> 01:02:14.273
Ops Code A. Repeat, Ops Code A.
Breach on Level 1.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.275
Intruder ascending in Elevator 4.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:18.694
<i>I want all levels ready
on that elevator now!</i>

01:02:23.116 --> 01:02:24.784
- Anaesthesia ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:02:24.951 --> 01:02:25.827
Good.

01:02:49.517 --> 01:02:50.935
<i>Security units on alert.</i>

01:02:51.102 --> 01:02:53.813
<i>Ops Code A.
Intruder on premises.</i>

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.607
<i>Secure the east wing.
All units, intruder's ascending...</i>

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:57.650
<i>...in the elevator.</i>

01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.193
Come on.

01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:00.903
Let's go.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:20.923
Move!

01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:39.734
<i>There's your cue.</i>

01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:41.027
Copy.

01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:13.893
They're using silver-nitrate gas.
Bombs on all the floors.

01:04:14.894 --> 01:04:18.189
It's Subject 1. We need to evacuate.

01:04:18.523 --> 01:04:19.732
Fine.

01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:20.733
Start a propofol...

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:21.651
...infusion.

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:25.863
We're not cancelling this procedure,
understood? We're moving it.

01:04:27.198 --> 01:04:28.616
You find her...

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.868
...and you destroy her.

01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:32.537
With pleasure.

01:04:46.259 --> 01:04:46.926
I'm here.

01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:48.553
I got movement on a van in...

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:49.595
...Parking Level 3.

01:04:49.762 --> 01:04:51.264
<i>No sign of the girl.</i>

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:54.767
They'll be on the move.
Just don't lose them.

01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:01.065
She's in the service elevator.

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:03.818
Get her.

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:04.944
I'm coming down.

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:30.553
Selene. Selene!

01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:34.015
They're heading for Parking Level 2.

01:05:36.517 --> 01:05:37.852
Selene.

01:05:38.019 --> 01:05:38.978
<i>I need to know...</i>

01:05:39.145 --> 01:05:39.895
<i>...where you are!</i>

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.657
Shit!

01:06:06.714 --> 01:06:07.840
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:09.467
Selene, where are you?

01:06:39.955 --> 01:06:41.040
I see her. I see her.

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:42.625
Parking Level 2.

01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:44.001
They're loading her...

01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:45.378
...into the van.

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:47.171
Selene, where are you?

01:06:49.757 --> 01:06:51.008
Fuck it.

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:57.515
Hold it right there! Stop! Stop now!

01:07:09.735 --> 01:07:10.403
Michael?

01:07:10.569 --> 01:07:11.570
Get her!

01:07:11.737 --> 01:07:12.697
Take her out!

01:07:23.165 --> 01:07:24.667
<i>Selene, Lane has her...</i>

01:07:24.834 --> 01:07:27.420
<i>...in the van.
They're on the move. Where are you?</i>

01:07:27.586 --> 01:07:29.505
<i>They are leaving with her!
Do you hear me?</i>

01:07:31.716 --> 01:07:33.050
I'm on my way.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:02.848
Come on, faster.

01:09:21.826 --> 01:09:22.660
Don't stop.

01:09:22.827 --> 01:09:23.493
Hit him!

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.107
Selene, they're heading
for Parking Level 1.

01:09:55.568 --> 01:09:58.529
<i>Selene, they're getting away
on Parking Level 1. Do you copy?</i>

01:09:58.821 --> 01:10:00.406
I'm coming.

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:24.430
Everything okay?

01:10:24.597 --> 01:10:25.431
Levels are...

01:10:25.598 --> 01:10:27.600
...holding stable, sir. Baseline vitals--

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:10.828
Fuck you.

01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:55.122
Get away from her!

01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:56.994
It's worse if you try to fight it.

01:15:00.205 --> 01:15:01.582
Trust me.

01:15:59.181 --> 01:16:01.934
I heal instantly.

01:16:02.184 --> 01:16:03.268
I'm counting on it.

01:17:02.202 --> 01:17:04.204
You came back for me.

01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:10.335
I said I would.

01:17:11.378 --> 01:17:12.796
Selene.

01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:17.843
You should go.

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:22.472
There's a safe house
not far from here.

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:23.640
Go. I'll send them...

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:26.476
...on a different path,
buy you some time.

01:17:27.519 --> 01:17:29.563
Thank you. Come on.

01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:31.189
David.

01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:35.360
Are we going back in?

01:17:35.527 --> 01:17:36.862
We are.

01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:55.672
What is it?

01:17:57.215 --> 01:17:58.050
Michael?

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.511
The roof.

01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:12.105
<i>Though the world has changed,
our enemy remains the same.</i>

01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:13.899
<i>The Lycans...</i>

01:18:14.066 --> 01:18:15.067
<i>...Will rebuild.</i>

01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:17.319
<i>And will hunt for her father
as they did...</i>

01:18:17.486 --> 01:18:18.278
<i>...for her.</i>

01:18:21.073 --> 01:18:22.574
<i>But as they grow stronger...</i>

01:18:23.075 --> 01:18:24.576
<i>...so will we.</i>

01:18:25.494 --> 01:18:27.204
<i>The Vampire coven will not only...</i>

01:18:27.371 --> 01:18:29.081
<i>survive this world</i>

01:18:29.748 --> 01:18:31.666
<i>...we will reclaim it.</i>
