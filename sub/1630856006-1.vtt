New York, the mid 1970s.

05:19.230 --> 05:21.451
A handful of breakthrough artists combined

05:21.451 --> 05:23.249
a visual power of graffiti art

05:23.249 --> 05:25.937
and a fresh new craze called Break Dancing

05:25.937 --> 05:27.192
with a backbeat of a DJ

05:27.192 --> 05:30.669
and a hungry MC armed
only with a microphone.

05:30.669 --> 05:32.792
Through this marriage of urban art styles,

05:32.792 --> 05:34.270
hip hop was born.

05:34.270 --> 05:35.539
Vocally,

05:35.539 --> 05:38.466
rapping took the sensibility
of spoken word poetry

05:38.466 --> 05:40.124
and put it to a beat.

05:40.124 --> 05:41.883
Some wrote their rhymes down

05:41.883 --> 05:44.798
while others made their rhymes
off the top of their head.

- [Grandmaster Caz] Hiphop
started as hiphop in 1973.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.717
We date the birth of hiphop in 1973.

05:56.717 --> 06:01.438
The first documented hip hop
party was given in a small

06:01.438 --> 06:03.841
apartment building on the
west side of the Bronx

06:03.841 --> 06:05.174
by DJ Kool Herc.

06:06.472 --> 06:09.082
And so we marked that date
as the birth of hip hop.

06:09.082 --> 06:12.595
We marked that place as
the birth place of hip hop.

06:12.595 --> 06:14.869
And we marked that DJ as the father.

06:21.521 --> 06:24.404
but it was a rec room on
Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx.

06:24.404 --> 06:26.941
And Melle Mel used to bring people out

06:26.941 --> 06:29.018
and throw these little hip hop parties

06:29.018 --> 06:30.720
DJing then got to the point where

06:30.720 --> 06:32.438
they'd throw a little MC to talk

07:27.977 --> 07:29.649
to come off the top of your head

07:29.649 --> 07:32.335
and make a rhyme up, you know.

07:32.335 --> 07:34.815
But at one point
freestyling meant, you know,

07:34.815 --> 07:37.161
just rhyming about no subject matters

07:37.161 --> 07:39.311
because a lot of MCs was making stories

07:39.311 --> 07:41.327
and lyrics with subjects.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.490
So freestyle kind of
meant just braggadocious.

07:43.490 --> 07:45.807
But then it came to a point
where freestyle artists

07:45.807 --> 07:48.748
basically means the let the
lyrics flow freely through you

07:48.748 --> 07:50.825
and come off your head.

07:50.825 --> 07:53.856

07:53.856 --> 07:55.394
where you gimme anything,

07:55.394 --> 07:56.574
you could see a mosquito

07:56.574 --> 07:59.188
and I come with a whole
fuckin' two minute rap

07:59.188 --> 08:00.724

- I mean it it just go way
back to the Sugar Hill Gang.

09:06.104 --> 09:09.494
I think that was like one of
the first songs that I really,

09:09.494 --> 09:11.793
really heard and really
started getting into.

09:11.793 --> 09:12.779
You know what I'm saying?

09:12.779 --> 09:15.243
At my time back in like '77,

09:15.243 --> 09:16.393
you know what I mean?

09:16.393 --> 09:17.497
Earlier,

09:17.497 --> 09:19.514
Sugar Hill Gang with a pow pow boogie

09:19.514 --> 09:20.873
and the big bang bang.

09:20.873 --> 09:21.933
You know what I'm saying?

09:21.933 --> 09:23.606
That was one of my favorite joints

09:23.606 --> 09:25.652
when I went over a friend's house to eat.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.414
And the food just ain't no good.

09:27.414 --> 09:28.502
The macaroni salad,

09:28.502 --> 09:29.740
the pizza, know what I'm sayin'

09:29.740 --> 09:31.341
and chicken tastes like wood.

09:31.341 --> 09:32.372
You know what I'm saying?

09:32.372 --> 09:35.493
A lot of people they get
into Rakim and all of them.

09:35.493 --> 09:38.770
Yeah. That's definitely the
facts of life right there.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.388
But I go back to

09:40.388 --> 09:44.337
♪ White lines, vivid dreams of passion. ♪

09:44.337 --> 09:45.170
- You know what I'm saying?

09:45.170 --> 09:47.518
So it's like when I look up
hip hop in a dictionary, man,

09:47.518 --> 09:49.435
I see, I just see like,

09:51.747 --> 09:54.247
you know, smart entrepreneurs,

09:55.269 --> 09:57.657
like a group of minorities

09:57.657 --> 10:00.436
that came up from nothing

10:00.436 --> 10:03.318
and had these harsh realities,

10:03.318 --> 10:04.302
you know,

10:04.302 --> 10:07.768
mixed with this soulfulness
to express to the people.

10:07.768 --> 10:09.932
Man, and that's me too.

10:09.932 --> 10:10.765
- [Fat Joe] You know,

10:10.765 --> 10:12.113
it's unfair being from New York

10:12.113 --> 10:14.622
to be honest with you
as an artist in hip hop

10:14.622 --> 10:17.430
because being that it was born here,

10:17.430 --> 10:19.476
they expect so much out of us.

10:19.476 --> 10:20.461
You know what I'm saying?

10:20.461 --> 10:21.475
So when we do a song,

10:21.475 --> 10:24.881
not only does it have to
be a catchy hit record,

10:24.881 --> 10:28.644
but you have to lyrically
rip it down crazy.

10:28.644 --> 10:30.183
You know what I'm saying?

10:30.183 --> 10:31.914
So that, you know what I'm saying?

10:31.914 --> 10:34.379
It could even be respected
coming outta New York.

10:34.379 --> 10:37.320
You can't get away with
just doing whatever, man.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.322
- [Grandmaster Caz] Our
rebellion against disco

10:39.322 --> 10:40.994
was the breeding ground for hip hop.

10:40.994 --> 10:41.935
You know what I mean?

10:41.935 --> 10:45.018
We try to create our own disco, okay?

10:46.311 --> 10:48.728
Our version of a disco, okay?

10:50.047 --> 10:52.078
You could wear your sneakers, your hats,

10:52.078 --> 10:53.363
whatever the fuck you want to wear,

10:53.363 --> 10:54.617
you come as you are.

10:54.617 --> 10:57.748
- [Pete Rock] You had Bambaata
and you had Cold Crush

10:57.748 --> 10:59.903
and Grandmaster Flash and you know,

10:59.903 --> 11:01.919
that was the school I come from.

11:01.919 --> 11:03.185
- [Masta Ace] And somebody
would come through

11:03.185 --> 11:04.279
with the hot new tape.

11:04.279 --> 11:06.835
Y'all got Cold Crush performing
at such and such club

11:06.835 --> 11:09.373
last night and let me get a copy

11:09.373 --> 11:11.718
and everybody bring their
blanks out and duck copies.

11:11.718 --> 11:13.361
And then, you know,

11:13.361 --> 11:14.839
when you had that new routine

11:14.839 --> 11:16.034
that they were doing at the club,

11:16.034 --> 11:17.721
you were the hottest dude
if you had that tape.

11:17.721 --> 11:20.049
- [Sheek Louch] These mix tapes
back then with your freestyles

11:20.049 --> 11:22.933
and doing all that was
street albums damn near.

11:22.933 --> 11:23.978
Like, you know what I'm saying?

11:23.978 --> 11:25.128
Like when you couldn't get a deal,

11:25.128 --> 11:26.890
this was an album on the
street that came out.

11:26.890 --> 11:29.264
They was waiting for a
mixtape to hit New York City.

11:29.264 --> 11:32.132
You know what I mean? So
it's a little sweeter now.

11:32.132 --> 11:34.133
Like they, you know, you
get the game right now,

11:34.133 --> 11:36.474
they just anything's on the mixtape

11:36.474 --> 11:38.806
and it's just so you
don't even wanna listen

11:38.806 --> 11:40.180
to the old shit 'cause you like,

11:40.180 --> 11:41.226
who the hell is this?

11:41.226 --> 11:43.242
- [Sean Kingston] I freestyle
before I even write a song

11:43.242 --> 11:44.883
like I just freestyle out words,

11:44.883 --> 11:45.716
you know what I'm saying?

11:45.716 --> 11:46.841
Just to get the words now packed.

11:46.841 --> 11:48.498
So if you can't really freestyle,

11:48.498 --> 11:50.293
you gotta be able to write.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.933
'cause you got people can't freestyle,

11:51.933 --> 11:54.009
but they write hella songs I'm saying.

11:54.009 --> 11:56.072
And they're hella good songwriters.

11:56.072 --> 11:58.387
But the only thing is it's
even better when you can

11:58.387 --> 11:59.655
freestyle 'cause it's like, man,

11:59.655 --> 12:02.193
I'm saying and you just
listening to the beat

12:02.193 --> 12:04.689
and you just freestyle like,
you know what I'm saying?

12:04.689 --> 12:05.957
I'm a soldier or whatever it is.

12:05.957 --> 12:07.959
And it just comes out
to you and you're like,

12:07.959 --> 12:08.792
yo wait,

12:08.792 --> 12:10.244
that's a hot hook that
it stains in your brain

12:10.244 --> 12:11.159
and you just like, all right,

12:11.159 --> 12:12.168
I'm gonna write that down like Jay-Z,

12:12.168 --> 12:14.093
Jay-Z goes in the booth, no pen, no pad.

12:14.093 --> 12:14.962
I'm saying just go in,

12:14.962 --> 12:16.545
just freestyle and record it down

12:16.545 --> 12:18.695
and just you know what
I mean memorize it back.

12:18.695 --> 12:19.591
And he has his verse.

12:19.591 --> 12:22.175
- [Open Mike Eagle] Where like when
I came up you had to do at least two

12:22.175 --> 12:23.847
things or you couldn't
even call yourself hip hop.

12:23.847 --> 12:24.788
When I came up.

12:24.788 --> 12:27.399
Like so all of us were break
dancers, graffiti artists

12:27.399 --> 12:29.418
and rappers and if we
could afford turntables,

12:29.418 --> 12:31.449
we were DJs too.

- Freestyling is not an east
coast or a west coast thing.

13:16.675 --> 13:17.855
It's a hip hop thing.

13:17.855 --> 13:21.558
- Originally the term freestyle
had nothing to do with it

13:21.558 --> 13:23.154
being off the top of the head.

13:23.154 --> 13:26.842
- Freestyling used to mean
just using a rhyme that wasn't

13:26.842 --> 13:29.965
attached to something
like a song, a routine

13:29.965 --> 13:32.609
or part of a group situation.

13:32.609 --> 13:35.655
It was just one of the rhymes
that you had a random rhyme.

13:35.655 --> 13:37.701
- Freestyling in New York
means something different

13:37.701 --> 13:38.866
than what it means in LA.

13:38.866 --> 13:41.284
In LA it means off the top
of the dome in New York.

13:41.284 --> 13:43.376
I've heard rappers like
Kurtis Blow even say

13:43.376 --> 13:45.795
freestyle is just a rap
you haven't heard yet.

13:45.795 --> 13:47.884
- Nowadays freestyling
just means off the head

13:47.884 --> 13:50.066
back in the day off the
head, off the dome was like,

13:50.066 --> 13:52.426
you just wrapped off, you know,
whatever came to your head.

13:52.426 --> 13:55.334
Like Roxanne Shante, she
would just, you know,

13:55.334 --> 13:57.354
she didn't even write
rhymes in the studio.

13:57.354 --> 13:58.712
Like if she wrote you'd be like, what?

13:58.712 --> 14:00.729
You know she just freestyled
half of those classic,

14:00.729 --> 14:01.834
you know, have a nice day.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.131
She had all these classic records

14:03.131 --> 14:04.193
and they were off the head.

14:04.193 --> 14:05.026
- [Sheek Louch] When Roxanne Shante,

14:05.026 --> 14:06.224
you know what I'm saying?

14:06.224 --> 14:07.426
Roxanne, Roxanne.

14:07.426 --> 14:08.996
When they UTFO and all
'em and they was going at

14:08.996 --> 14:11.027
it, I'm like wow, I got
a Mr Magic is playing,

14:11.027 --> 14:12.684
I put the tissue on the top of the TDK

14:12.684 --> 14:14.835
and was doing it like that.
You know what I'm saying?

14:14.835 --> 14:16.313
And I was like, wow, this is crazy.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.613
Did you hear what she said
back to them and all that?

14:18.613 --> 14:23.613
- So somewhere along the way
the term freestyle started to

14:23.944 --> 14:25.960
connote, you know,

14:25.960 --> 14:27.988
rhyming off the top and
and that's what people

14:27.988 --> 14:30.007
now refer to it as.

14:30.007 --> 14:31.037
- [Iron Solomon] It's an evolution.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.259
And I think even in the '90s

14:33.259 --> 14:35.861
when like freestyle was
like the catch word,

14:35.861 --> 14:39.803
I think the idea that you have
certain lines that are your

14:39.803 --> 14:42.925
go-to lines and you have
certain fallback stuff

14:42.925 --> 14:46.045
and the ability to be spontaneous

14:46.045 --> 14:48.417
and mix in stuff that you're
thinking up on the spot.

14:48.417 --> 14:50.764
You know something about
somebody's clothing

14:50.764 --> 14:51.884
or the club that you're in

14:51.884 --> 14:54.197
and then pull on those other lines

14:54.197 --> 14:55.692
and those other parts of your brain

14:55.692 --> 14:58.230
that you just have these
different pieces stored.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.185
- [Ice-T] Freestylers have the
ability to think on they feet

15:01.185 --> 15:04.607
and as they rhyme they're
making the rhyme up

15:04.607 --> 15:05.727
as they go along.

15:05.727 --> 15:07.893
I'm coming off the dome
right now coming off.

15:07.893 --> 15:09.924

18:21.101 --> 18:23.857

freestyling off the head.

18:25.873 --> 18:28.952
- To take it from the great jazz artists

18:28.952 --> 18:30.855
like Bird and Miles.

18:30.855 --> 18:32.736

18:34.823 --> 18:38.141
their creative side was doing
with their thinking side

18:38.141 --> 18:39.755
was beautiful.

18:39.755 --> 18:42.487

18:42.487 --> 18:43.623
- Learning pattern control.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.323
Learning how to beat and rhyme

18:45.323 --> 18:46.953
and keep the subject and the pattern

- [Gift Of Gab] Freestyle
is like a lucid reality.

23:12.779 --> 23:15.497
You know like they say that
life is just a dream that this

23:15.497 --> 23:17.558
is all a dream that lasts
like a hundred years.

23:17.558 --> 23:20.709
But when you asleep,
dreams are more lucid.

23:20.709 --> 23:23.188
You can be anywhere at any time.

23:23.188 --> 23:25.831
Only this reality is more structured.

23:25.831 --> 23:27.145
- [Ras Kass] Life is like freestyling.

23:27.145 --> 23:28.071
You know,

23:28.071 --> 23:31.878
you don't have a set goal,
you don't have a set journey.

23:31.878 --> 23:32.879
And sometimes you do

23:32.879 --> 23:34.534
and you still get hit with a speed bump.

23:34.534 --> 23:35.941
You may stumble and it may
change your whole trajectory,

23:35.941 --> 23:38.330
but your end goal is to win.

23:38.330 --> 23:40.424
- [Del] I mean you going to mess
up. You know what I'm saying?

23:40.424 --> 23:41.558
You going mess up sometimes.

23:41.558 --> 23:43.619
Sometimes you going to not rhyme,

23:43.619 --> 23:46.053
sometimes you going to
inadvertently diss yourself.

23:46.053 --> 23:47.114
You know what I'm saying?

23:47.114 --> 23:48.338
Like, you know what I'm saying?

23:48.338 --> 23:49.891
Like you gonna say something stupid.

23:49.891 --> 23:51.638
But if you could just bounce back

23:51.638 --> 23:53.849
and just keep it going, you know,

23:53.849 --> 23:55.880
that's where you kind of
get your respect from.

23:55.880 --> 23:59.373
And you gotta kind of have
like a low amount of fear.

23:59.373 --> 24:01.456
- [Sean Price] Freestyle is a thought.

24:03.265 --> 24:06.721
So if it's a thought
and you put it on paper.

24:06.721 --> 24:08.485
It ain't a freestyle no more.

24:08.485 --> 24:09.381
You know, simple.

24:09.381 --> 24:10.800
You know, simple as that.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.756
You know,

24:11.756 --> 24:13.428
if I just choose to go willy-nilly with it

24:13.428 --> 24:14.741
and you know what I mean,

24:14.741 --> 24:15.574
then it's a freestyle.

24:15.574 --> 24:17.236
You know the thoughts you put on paper

24:17.236 --> 24:19.267
and the thoughts you
just spit out sporadic.

24:19.267 --> 24:20.100
You know,

24:20.100 --> 24:22.194
that's the difference between
the song and the freestyle.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.027
- [B-Real] You know,

24:23.027 --> 24:24.927
there was cats that wrote their raps

24:24.927 --> 24:27.567
and dudes that did it
off the top of the head.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.393
And with the guys did
that were writing it,

24:30.393 --> 24:31.976
you could pretty much tell it was written.

24:31.976 --> 24:32.976
You know what I mean?

24:32.976 --> 24:34.096
' cause it was,

24:34.096 --> 24:36.274
you could tell there was a
lot of structure there where

24:36.274 --> 24:37.904
guys from off the top of the head,

24:37.904 --> 24:40.726
they were just spitting a lot
of stuff that sounded cool,

24:40.726 --> 24:42.459
Really, some of it didn't make sense.

24:42.459 --> 24:44.520
It became one of those things where

24:44.520 --> 24:46.252
you had to be good at both.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.701
You had to be good at
writing and free styling.

24:48.701 --> 24:51.150
There are some dudes that
do it better than others.

24:51.150 --> 24:54.166
Like a guy like Supernatural, you know,

24:54.166 --> 24:57.808
which is probably one of
the best at freestyling

24:57.808 --> 24:58.885
off the top of his head.

24:58.885 --> 25:02.021
- The best freestyler I've ever
seen in my life is a rapper

25:02.021 --> 25:03.557
named Supernatural.

25:03.557 --> 25:06.603
And I've seen him like just
pick people outta the audience

25:06.603 --> 25:09.309
and make intricate rhymes
and not rhyme simple.

25:09.309 --> 25:12.773

27:01.682 --> 27:03.205
You gotta be quick on your feet.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.145
You have to think on the fly
and always keep it moving.

27:06.145 --> 27:09.000
Then it is a game to me too
when I'm on stage freestyling

27:09.000 --> 27:11.493
to see how much I can
come up with off the head.

27:11.493 --> 27:13.238
How much I can make on the spot.

27:13.238 --> 27:16.018
You know how many people
I can move by my music.

27:16.018 --> 27:17.108
For those that don't know,

27:17.108 --> 27:20.304
I currently hold the world
record for the longest freestyle

27:20.304 --> 27:21.615
rap off the dome.

27:21.615 --> 27:25.217
We did that at San Bernardino
at the fairgrounds out there,

27:25.217 --> 27:26.396
the Orange show.

27:26.396 --> 27:29.846
And it was nine hours and
15 minutes off the head.

27:29.846 --> 27:32.264
And until you've attempted
something like that,

27:32.264 --> 27:37.264
you can't possibly imagine the
mental power that it takes to

27:37.313 --> 27:38.672
pull off something like that.

27:38.672 --> 27:40.972
Every hour in between hours,

27:40.972 --> 27:42.522
they would make us take a break

27:42.522 --> 27:43.929
so that I could catch my breath.

27:43.929 --> 27:46.019
It was only a five minute
break you were allotted.

27:46.019 --> 27:48.107
But just to be on stage
rhyming for that long,

27:48.107 --> 27:50.096
you go into like a euphoria almost.

27:50.096 --> 27:51.589
You go into a different world.

27:51.589 --> 27:52.422
- For me,

27:52.422 --> 27:55.099
when I was like rhyming every
single day all the time,

27:55.099 --> 27:59.190
I could like feel several
different trains of thought

27:59.190 --> 28:00.460
going on at the same time.

28:00.460 --> 28:01.654
So I could, you know,

28:01.654 --> 28:03.088
know what I was about to say.

28:03.088 --> 28:05.940
And then I would also be
thinking about the next rhyme

28:05.940 --> 28:07.985
while I was saying one.

28:07.985 --> 28:11.824
And then another part of me
was almost outside of my body,

28:11.824 --> 28:15.498
like holy shit, am I really
doing this right now?

What is your brain doing

28:55.459 --> 29:00.072
They wanted to do a pilot
program where they measured the

29:00.072 --> 29:04.180
brain activity in the different
lobes while someone was

29:04.180 --> 29:06.211
engaging in freestyle rap.

29:06.211 --> 29:07.419
- [Dr. Charles Limb] My
name is Charles Limb.

29:07.419 --> 29:08.748
I am an otolaryngologist,

29:08.748 --> 29:11.022
a head and neck surgeon here
at Johns Hopkins Hospital in

29:11.022 --> 29:12.528
Baltimore, Maryland.

29:12.528 --> 29:13.505
In common terms,

29:13.505 --> 29:16.193
what that means is I study
ear, nose, and throat medicine.

29:16.193 --> 29:19.239
I focus on how people hear
complex things such as music.

29:19.239 --> 29:23.299
My clinical practice is all
based on treatment of people

29:23.299 --> 29:25.691
with hearing loss or
musicians or deafness.

29:25.691 --> 29:28.961
And then my research all centers
around how it is that we're

29:28.961 --> 29:31.097
able to do this thing called music.

29:31.097 --> 29:31.948
So as a musician,

29:31.948 --> 29:33.740
I've been playing jazz my whole life

29:33.740 --> 29:35.308
and one of the main things about jazz

29:35.308 --> 29:36.726
is that the music is improvised.

29:36.726 --> 29:38.727
And so this is something
that as a listener

29:38.727 --> 29:39.833
and as an amateur player,

29:39.833 --> 29:41.593
I'd always thought, wow,
this is kind of great.

29:41.593 --> 29:42.759
You know, I love improvising,

29:42.759 --> 29:44.507
I love listening to somebody improvise.

29:44.507 --> 29:46.819
The more I started listening to jazz

29:46.819 --> 29:48.449
and thinking about it at a higher level,

29:48.449 --> 29:49.718
I started thinking, oh,

29:49.718 --> 29:50.988
how are they doing this?

29:50.988 --> 29:53.362
How does John Coltrane do
that when he's playing?

29:53.362 --> 29:55.094
How did Miles Davis do that?

29:55.094 --> 29:57.676
And at first it was really the
kind of question that anybody

29:57.676 --> 29:59.694
who likes music or jazz would ask.

29:59.694 --> 30:00.527
You know,

30:00.527 --> 30:02.486
you'd kind of casually throw
that question out there.

30:02.486 --> 30:04.501
But for me it became more
than a casual question.

30:04.501 --> 30:05.334
I said,

30:05.334 --> 30:07.340
wow, you know, how does he do it?

30:07.340 --> 30:09.371
And then I thought to myself,
well let's try to find out.

30:09.371 --> 30:12.279
I wanted to start directing
my efforts towards music

30:12.279 --> 30:14.836
and I decided to study
functional brain imaging.

30:14.836 --> 30:16.733
That's a method relatively recent,

30:16.733 --> 30:18.764
depending on your frame of mind,

30:18.764 --> 30:21.093
where you can take a person,

30:21.093 --> 30:25.095
put 'em in a MRI machine and
look at their brain activity

30:25.095 --> 30:26.439
while they're doing something.

30:26.439 --> 30:27.272
So in my case,

30:27.272 --> 30:28.978
if I designed an experiment properly,

30:28.978 --> 30:31.577
I should be able to
study how a jazz musician

30:31.577 --> 30:35.549
or a freestyle rapper
improvises in real time.

30:50.781 --> 30:53.036
- When we did the
functional brain scanning

30:53.036 --> 30:53.917
of jazz musicians,

30:53.917 --> 30:56.631
the results were pretty
striking to me in the end.

30:56.631 --> 30:59.024
What we found though was that
the whole brain is really

30:59.024 --> 31:01.100
engaged during a process of improvisation.

31:01.100 --> 31:01.933
It really,

31:01.933 --> 31:04.382
creativity engages the entire brain.

31:04.382 --> 31:06.774
And that in and of itself is
a pretty remarkable finding.

31:06.774 --> 31:08.417
But very specifically,

31:08.417 --> 31:11.105
we also found that in the
prefrontal cortex of the brain,

31:11.105 --> 31:13.868
that's this part of the brain
up here that really separates

31:13.868 --> 31:15.016
humans from animals.

31:15.016 --> 31:17.661
We had a very interesting
combination of things where a

31:17.661 --> 31:20.091
broad portion of this
brain was turning off.

31:20.091 --> 31:23.306
And by turning off, I mean it
was relatively deactivated.

31:23.306 --> 31:26.203
And these are areas that are
thought to be involved in many

31:26.203 --> 31:29.682
things, including conscious
self-monitoring, self-censoring,

31:29.682 --> 31:30.638
self inhibition,

31:30.638 --> 31:33.296
a way to kind of put a
context to what you're doing.

31:33.296 --> 31:36.656
All the rule-based ways that
we evaluate our own efforts

31:36.656 --> 31:39.404
and goal-directed
behaviors are all filtered

31:39.404 --> 31:41.435
through this consciousness that we have.

31:41.435 --> 31:43.734
And in improvisation that consciousness

31:43.734 --> 31:45.484
was being turned off.

31:46.414 --> 31:49.685
(funky hip hop beat)

31:49.685 --> 31:52.379
- In LA the underground
hip hop that was cracking

31:52.379 --> 31:55.860
was due to the fact that
gangsta rap was so big

31:55.860 --> 31:59.748
and nobody knew that
there were cats out here

31:59.748 --> 32:01.464
that were doing, you know,

32:01.464 --> 32:03.317
conscious rap or just rap.

32:03.317 --> 32:04.721
That was the alternative to gangsta.

32:04.721 --> 32:05.826
- Growing up in LA

32:05.826 --> 32:06.946
you know,

32:06.946 --> 32:09.141
we caught the hip hop

32:09.141 --> 32:11.784
and the rap influence a little bit later.

32:11.784 --> 32:12.617
You know,

32:12.617 --> 32:13.681
New York had it first

32:13.681 --> 32:16.324
and it started trickling down here to LA

32:16.324 --> 32:19.279
on a station called K-D-A-Y.

32:19.279 --> 32:23.327
- As far as me taking notice
of gangsta rap would be

32:23.327 --> 32:24.244
Ice-T, NWA.

32:25.122 --> 32:27.332
Obviously the next evolution after that is

32:27.332 --> 32:28.999
Snoop Death Row, Pac

32:31.130 --> 32:35.654
and their counterparts
would be Biggie, Jay-Z, Nas.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.715
- [The Game] As far as Los
Angeles and California, man,

32:37.715 --> 32:39.656
there was nothing like it.

32:39.656 --> 32:41.702
Everything that was rapped about

32:41.702 --> 32:43.883
you could walk out your front
door and see and you know,

32:43.883 --> 32:45.689
without even wanting to be a part of it,

32:45.689 --> 32:46.974
you were a part of it, man.

32:46.974 --> 32:48.497
So that's how I came up.

32:48.497 --> 32:51.006
And you know, it was scary.

32:51.006 --> 32:53.604
'cause you know, the music, the lifestyle,

32:53.604 --> 32:57.427
Los Angeles in general, the
riots when I was 11 years old,

32:57.427 --> 32:58.693
like you could die.

32:58.693 --> 33:02.012
You know, being a part of
what it was transforming into.

33:02.012 --> 33:04.371
- From the coexistence of, you know,

33:04.371 --> 33:09.030
what we call gangsta rap NWAs
to what became, you know,

33:09.030 --> 33:12.002
considered the avant-garde
West coast hip hop, which is,

33:12.002 --> 33:14.361
you know, Pharsyde and
Freestyle Fellowship.

33:14.361 --> 33:15.705
Now we have, you know,

33:15.705 --> 33:18.991

- [Narrator] Introducing Open Mike Eagle

34:37.631 --> 34:39.990
outta South Central LA's
Freestyle collective.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.240
Project Blowed.

34:43.344 --> 34:45.172
- I've been rapping since I was 16.

34:45.172 --> 34:47.143
I've been rapping since
I was in high school.

34:47.143 --> 34:49.562
I didn't start doing shows
till I was in college

34:49.562 --> 34:53.818
and I didn't write a song until
I had to do my first show.

34:53.818 --> 34:57.745
And so started writing
and recording in college

34:57.745 --> 35:02.717
and then put out my first EP
shortly after I moved out here.

35:02.717 --> 35:05.377
And just about every label
I would want to deal with

35:05.377 --> 35:06.751
and where it would make sense.

35:06.751 --> 35:08.095
And these are all independent labels.

35:08.095 --> 35:09.065
I'm on their radar.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.230
We know each other.

35:10.230 --> 35:13.904
There's professional networking
and relationships happening.

35:13.904 --> 35:18.025
So not only does it make more
sense for me to deal with this

35:18.025 --> 35:19.130
particular style of label,

35:19.130 --> 35:23.192
it's easier because I'm
already part of the machine

35:23.192 --> 35:24.058
in a sense.

35:24.058 --> 35:27.777
Whereas me trying to
deal with a major label,

35:27.777 --> 35:30.032
I'm literally cold calling

35:30.032 --> 35:33.897
or cold emailing or trying to
show up at somebody's office

35:33.897 --> 35:37.722
and trying to somehow
put myself into a context

35:37.722 --> 35:39.948
to something that they understand

35:39.948 --> 35:43.875
or to something that's
similar to what they sell.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.070
And what I do is really not like that.

35:46.070 --> 35:48.176
- The majors recoup, you know,

35:48.176 --> 35:50.637
they give you a whole bunch
of money and take it back.

35:50.637 --> 35:52.760
But India, it doesn't happen that way.

35:52.760 --> 35:53.865
You know what I'm saying?

35:53.865 --> 35:56.225
You're out there, you
making your own moves.

35:56.225 --> 35:58.256
And what's cool about India is that

35:58.256 --> 35:59.791
if you know what you're doing,

35:59.791 --> 36:02.407
you know what I'm saying,
you can go far, you know,

36:02.407 --> 36:04.856
and you don't have to answer to anyone.

36:04.856 --> 36:07.664
- You know, me being a person that's,

36:07.664 --> 36:09.202
I mean just about completely independent.

36:09.202 --> 36:12.129
I mean I book 85% of my own dates.

36:12.129 --> 36:14.172
You know, I do, you know,

36:14.172 --> 36:15.907
I do all my own recording.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.252
I assemble a lot of my product on my own.

36:18.252 --> 36:21.641
I don't have time to really
pull teeth to put myself in a

36:21.641 --> 36:25.375
situation that my momentum
hasn't already carried me to.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.779
It just takes too much of my
energy and resources away.

36:27.779 --> 36:31.005
Where at the end of the day I
need to be trying to better my

36:31.005 --> 36:32.483
product as much as I can.

36:32.483 --> 36:34.185
I need to be trying to
write a better song.

36:34.185 --> 36:35.796
I need to be trying to
record a better verse.

36:35.796 --> 36:37.394
I need to be trying to find a
better beat or make a better

36:37.394 --> 36:38.395
beat all the time.

36:38.395 --> 36:40.413
- [DJ Muggs] You can be
creative as you want,

36:40.413 --> 36:41.786
you can go to the left,

36:41.786 --> 36:42.682
put your middle finger up,

36:42.682 --> 36:44.161
it's still urban punk rock,

36:44.161 --> 36:45.057
you know what I mean?

36:45.057 --> 36:46.416
And be creative and do
your own thing and still be

36:46.416 --> 36:49.445
successful and be monetarily
successful by doing your thing.

36:49.445 --> 36:51.925
You don't gotta go fit into this mode.

36:51.925 --> 36:54.151
Because I think if I was growing up today

36:54.151 --> 36:55.122
and I seen what was going on,

36:55.122 --> 36:56.466
I wouldn't even have been infatuated by it

36:56.466 --> 36:57.362
and wanted to do this.

36:57.362 --> 36:58.751
- [Planet Asia] I probably
wouldn't even be rhyming

36:58.751 --> 36:59.916
if I grew up in hip hop today,

36:59.916 --> 37:02.320
I probably would not be into hip hop.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.081
I'd probably be probably in
a martial arts or something.

37:05.081 --> 37:06.083
- Because you gotta fit into

37:06.083 --> 37:07.561
this cookie cutter category now.

37:07.561 --> 37:09.055
And back then you didn't.

37:09.055 --> 37:11.175
It was about going to the
left as much as you can

37:11.175 --> 37:12.159
to be accepted.

37:12.159 --> 37:14.967
Now it's like you gotta come
into this zone right here

37:14.967 --> 37:18.310
where everybody's at to be accepted.

37:18.310 --> 37:21.316
- I was about 12 years old.

37:21.316 --> 37:24.421
There was this older cat that
used to come to our building

37:24.421 --> 37:28.289
and he used to come through and freestyle.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.245
He was a rapper.

37:29.245 --> 37:31.544
He was kind of like somebody
everybody in the neighborhood

37:31.544 --> 37:33.575
looked up to because he was a rapper.

37:33.575 --> 37:35.293
So he would come through every day.

37:35.293 --> 37:37.981
We were all younger than him
so he would pick one person

37:37.981 --> 37:41.236
every day and he would take
off on him just what they were

37:41.236 --> 37:43.267
wearing, whatever, you know,

37:43.267 --> 37:45.432
bagging and capping, you know,

37:45.432 --> 37:47.192
like you did when you were younger.

37:47.192 --> 37:50.659
It was my turn and he basically, you know,

37:50.659 --> 37:54.333
just flashed on me, just
started freestyling about me.

37:54.333 --> 37:57.468
You know, I went home, I was
mad so I had to challenge him.

37:57.468 --> 38:00.082
So before I started
freestyling, I started writin'.

38:00.082 --> 38:04.144
I would ride a rhyme every day
and and go back to his crib.

38:04.144 --> 38:05.757
Me and my friend would go to his crib,

38:05.757 --> 38:06.996
ride our bikes to his crib,

38:06.996 --> 38:09.146
knock on his door and start rhyming.

38:09.146 --> 38:10.685
And of course he would kill us every day.

38:10.685 --> 38:12.253
We was using written's

38:12.253 --> 38:13.373
and he was using freestyles

38:13.373 --> 38:14.911
and he would kill us every day, you know,

38:14.911 --> 38:17.494
til I got older and I
started building my skill up

38:17.494 --> 38:20.747
and then I was finally able to beat him.

38:20.747 --> 38:24.617
- Anything you've just
made up is a freestyle.

38:24.617 --> 38:28.470
And that means if you're
kicking a written verse against

38:28.470 --> 38:31.113
somebody and you pull some
lines out of the sky to connect

38:31.113 --> 38:33.159
the dots, well then
that part is freestyle.

38:33.159 --> 38:34.772
So it's what, 10-15% freestyle.

38:34.772 --> 38:37.789
Whatever you know, percentage
you want to give it.

38:37.789 --> 38:41.913
Usually you can tell when
somebody's not coming completely

38:41.913 --> 38:46.181
off of the top because
it's mostly terrible.

38:46.181 --> 38:47.898
Especially if they're
trying to stay on subject

38:47.898 --> 38:50.079
and they didn't think
of absolutely anything.

38:50.079 --> 38:52.107
Then they're gonna be
grabbing all over the place.

38:52.107 --> 38:53.764
Occasionally they'll
tug against something.

38:53.764 --> 38:54.992
It sounds like it's relevant,

38:54.992 --> 38:56.246
but for the most part,

38:56.246 --> 38:58.352
and especially in battling,

38:58.352 --> 39:00.112
you fool not to think of anything.

39:00.112 --> 39:03.952
And even if you just thought
of it in between rounds,

39:03.952 --> 39:05.699
it's still premeditated.

39:05.699 --> 39:08.148
Now premeditated doesn't
necessarily mean written

39:08.148 --> 39:10.836
but you know, you prepared a little bit.

39:10.836 --> 39:12.867
You did something potent

39:12.867 --> 39:14.973
because you're trying to win a competition

39:14.973 --> 39:17.855
where you have to say better
things than the other person.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.483
- Without any further ado,

39:20.483 --> 39:22.529
are y'all ready to make
battle rap history?

39:22.529 --> 39:24.723
(crowd cheering)

39:24.723 --> 39:27.051
And on my left a battle rap legend.

39:27.051 --> 39:28.786
Y'all have seen him over the years.

39:28.786 --> 39:30.368

39:30.368 --> 39:31.451

- Battling is like a
cross between freestyling

40:50.474 --> 40:52.307
and pre-written disses

40:53.806 --> 40:55.935
that you weave into the
particular character.

40:55.935 --> 40:57.965
- When you rap battle face to face,

40:57.965 --> 41:01.475
the guy who's able to
freestyle better is the one

41:01.475 --> 41:02.610
who will rip you down.

41:02.610 --> 41:05.328
'cause he'll just get on you
in front of everybody talking

41:05.328 --> 41:08.404
about stuff that's right here
and you could grab and touch

41:08.404 --> 41:09.237
and be relevant.

41:09.237 --> 41:12.376
So, you know, it's
important to know that art.

41:12.376 --> 41:13.586
- On the battle.

41:13.586 --> 41:16.618
I think you come, you
know guns cocked already.

41:16.618 --> 41:19.604
You know, you know what you
gonna say for the most part.

41:19.604 --> 41:22.277
- I remember one guy I had a
battle with and he beat me.

41:22.277 --> 41:24.667
I was like 14 years old
and I probably had about,

41:24.667 --> 41:26.189
my record was maybe 15-0

41:26.189 --> 41:29.490
and I meet this guy who was
maybe about 18, 19 years old

41:29.490 --> 41:30.953
and he's ready to battle me.

41:30.953 --> 41:33.462
And my lyrics were so
scientific I would always win

41:33.462 --> 41:34.986
'cause of my vocabulary and lyrics

41:34.986 --> 41:37.464
and I'm saying all
these biochemist rhymes,

41:37.464 --> 41:39.495
I come from your throat, I spit the egg,

41:39.495 --> 41:41.540
the nucleus to the zygote.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.557
And I'm going through
all this thing, right?

41:43.557 --> 41:47.007
He said, MC Rakim, you
know you ain't shit.

41:47.007 --> 41:51.321
I make you bow on your knees
nigga and suck my dick.

41:51.321 --> 41:52.756
Yo.

41:52.756 --> 41:54.411
Everybody started laughing

41:54.411 --> 41:56.235
and the battle I lost

41:56.235 --> 41:58.383
'cause of that stupidness.

41:58.383 --> 41:59.354
And I was like,

41:59.354 --> 42:00.208
wow, okay,

42:00.208 --> 42:03.658
let me go back and get and
start making rhymes that's like

42:03.658 --> 42:05.688
more funny and more battle type.

42:05.688 --> 42:09.885
- [Tech N9ne] I would have like
stuff like pieces of rhymes sometimes

42:09.885 --> 42:11.524
mixed with freestylin',

42:11.524 --> 42:12.737
you know what I'm saying?

42:12.737 --> 42:14.036
Just, and a lot of MCs do it.

42:14.036 --> 42:15.261
You probably don't ever know,

42:15.261 --> 42:16.483
they won't tell you the truth,

42:16.483 --> 42:18.919
but I'll have like pieces of rhymes,

42:18.919 --> 42:19.860
you know what I mean?

42:19.860 --> 42:21.279
And I'll mix it in with freestyles man

42:21.279 --> 42:22.996
and then it'll just keep
going one after another.

42:22.996 --> 42:23.847
You know what I mean?

42:23.847 --> 42:25.057
And that's how we did it man.

42:25.057 --> 42:25.890
You know what I mean?

42:25.890 --> 42:27.850
Like you'll start off with
like four bars of a rhyme

42:27.850 --> 42:29.044
and then go into a freestyle

42:29.044 --> 42:31.060
and then another four bars or
another two bars of a rhyme

42:31.060 --> 42:31.893
blah blah blah.

42:31.893 --> 42:33.599
And you'll say something about
the person in front of you,

42:33.599 --> 42:34.525
then you keep on going.

42:34.525 --> 42:35.421
You know what I mean?

42:35.421 --> 42:36.331
So that's how I did it.

42:36.331 --> 42:40.259
- Because I think over time
it has become such a big deal

42:40.259 --> 42:44.562
to even exist in a freestyle
or not to lose or have,

42:44.562 --> 42:45.473
you know,

42:45.473 --> 42:46.397
punchlines ready.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.905
I think that some freestyle
artists just have certain

42:48.905 --> 42:51.518
punchlines in their head
that will go with pretty much

42:51.518 --> 42:52.351
anything.

42:52.351 --> 42:54.584
- You basically just wrote some shit

42:54.584 --> 42:55.856
to battle against this cat

42:55.856 --> 42:59.424
and you wrote it in a fashion that's like,

42:59.424 --> 43:04.424
if I do forget something I
can freestyle and patch it up.

43:04.804 --> 43:06.554
So you still like it.

43:07.451 --> 43:11.117
But I don't think going into any battle

43:11.117 --> 43:12.284
unless you say

43:14.341 --> 43:17.548
we battling on who got the hardest rhymes.

43:17.548 --> 43:18.979
This is a freestyle battle.

43:18.979 --> 43:22.341
You can't write a god damn thing,

43:22.341 --> 43:24.641
you can't write your name
on your hand in this battle.

43:24.641 --> 43:25.612
You know what I'm saying?

43:25.612 --> 43:27.343
No, no pens allowed, nothing.

43:27.343 --> 43:31.406
- When it comes to freestylin' over a beat

43:31.406 --> 43:34.167
or battling over a beat
versus battling acapella.

43:34.167 --> 43:37.586
Whereas you can see that when
somebody doesn't have a beat,

43:37.586 --> 43:41.394
they have more time to type
to kind of set up each line

43:41.394 --> 43:44.413
and deliver it and let
the reaction happen.

43:44.413 --> 43:48.143
But that's actually more
difficult to do than it looks

43:48.143 --> 43:50.670
to let each line breathe like that.

43:50.670 --> 43:53.134
Especially if you're trying
to remember a long thing

43:53.134 --> 43:54.269
that you wrote.

43:54.269 --> 43:55.102
You know,

43:55.102 --> 43:57.061
some of these guys go for unlimited rounds

43:57.061 --> 44:01.076
where they'll kick five
minutes worth of bars

44:01.076 --> 44:03.465
against this other person with no beat.

44:03.465 --> 44:05.588
And for me personally,

44:05.588 --> 44:07.978
it'd be easier to remember it all.

44:07.978 --> 44:10.351
If it was on a metronome,

44:10.351 --> 44:12.368
I could use the rhythm to carry me through

44:12.368 --> 44:13.368
remembering everything.

44:13.368 --> 44:15.026
But having taken that away,

44:15.026 --> 44:17.759
there's kind of no safety net
where like you could pause too

44:17.759 --> 44:18.592
long,

44:18.592 --> 44:20.014
forget what the next line is

44:20.014 --> 44:21.791
and then where are you in your sequence

44:21.791 --> 44:24.061
if that's the way that you're
putting it all together.

44:24.061 --> 44:25.746
- [Nocando] On the major
stage of battle rap

44:25.746 --> 44:30.587
like you better be your pen
game and your freestyle game.

44:30.587 --> 44:31.420
Whatever you,

44:31.420 --> 44:33.379
you choose is your front leg

44:33.379 --> 44:34.992
or the whatever you choose is your tool.

44:34.992 --> 44:35.873
You better be good.

44:35.873 --> 44:37.546
Like if there's a room full of 20 rappers,

44:37.546 --> 44:39.289
all those 20 rappers don't suck.

45:41.610 --> 45:44.013
(fun drum beat)

45:44.013 --> 45:45.685
- [Narrator] Meet Iron Solomon,

45:45.685 --> 45:47.015
a hungry young freestyler

45:47.015 --> 45:49.253
who came up in the New York battle scene

45:49.253 --> 45:53.016
and soon became its most
infamous internet champion.

45:53.016 --> 45:55.707
- I always wanted to be a rock
star when I was a little kid,

45:55.707 --> 45:56.573
you know,

45:56.573 --> 45:59.425
I wanted to be Slash and
then it became Biggie Smalls

45:59.425 --> 46:00.258
and Jay-Z.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.785
I was rapping since I was
probably about nine years old

46:02.785 --> 46:04.263
and playing guitar at the same time.

46:04.263 --> 46:05.503
And you know,

46:05.503 --> 46:07.892
writing rap songs and
writing songs on guitar

46:07.892 --> 46:10.640
and playing in band, you know,
doing Red Hot Chili Peppers,

46:10.640 --> 46:12.656
cover songs and stuff like that.

46:12.656 --> 46:16.509
And then when I was
about I guess 10 or 11,

46:16.509 --> 46:19.193
I switched to public school and you know,

46:19.193 --> 46:20.854
kids were freestyling in class

46:20.854 --> 46:22.318
and it was a different environment.

46:22.318 --> 46:25.319
So that's when I started to
not just write but freestyle.

46:25.319 --> 46:26.887
It's a vicious world out there

46:26.887 --> 46:29.038
where kids are always
talking shit to each other.

46:29.038 --> 46:31.097
So that was just part of
the way we interacted.

46:31.097 --> 46:33.186
It was normal everyday life
to talk shit to each other.

46:33.186 --> 46:34.712
So if we're freestyling, you know,

46:34.712 --> 46:36.950
you're bragging that I fucked your girl,

46:36.950 --> 46:38.161
I fucked your mom, you know,

46:38.161 --> 46:40.208
I'm gonna smack the outta
the teacher, whatever it is.

46:40.208 --> 46:41.924
I wasn't that good at basketball.

46:41.924 --> 46:45.300
Whatever it was just drew me to battling.

46:45.300 --> 46:48.675
And once I started to get a
little traction, you know,

46:48.675 --> 46:51.050
I saw it as a way to get a fan base,

46:51.050 --> 46:53.469
get my foot in the door and you know,

46:53.469 --> 46:56.239
build myself towards a career in music.

46:56.239 --> 47:00.860
- [Violent J] Today, having a
bomb freestyle that can really,

47:00.860 --> 47:01.952
you can be seen now.

47:01.952 --> 47:02.833
You got the internet,

47:02.833 --> 47:04.520
you can shine off that extra hard.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.701
It ain't like being on the corner anymore.

47:06.701 --> 47:08.732
You can become a star off that.

47:08.732 --> 47:09.717
You know.

47:09.717 --> 47:12.107
- [Prodigy] The game is
oversaturated with a lot of people

47:12.107 --> 47:14.196
just trying to rap, you know what I mean?

47:14.196 --> 47:15.029
And that's cool.

47:15.029 --> 47:15.862
'cause rap.

47:15.862 --> 47:18.005
So that's where we took
it, you know what I mean?

47:18.005 --> 47:20.066
It's real popular now.
It got big, it got huge.

47:20.066 --> 47:22.411
That's how we wanted it,
you know what I mean?

47:22.411 --> 47:24.440
So it's all good.

47:24.440 --> 47:26.532
But at the same time we just got more,

47:26.532 --> 47:29.922
you know what I mean, BS
than the stuff that's good.

47:29.922 --> 47:30.816
You know what I mean?

47:30.816 --> 47:32.879
Like it's a lot of stuff that's just,

47:32.879 --> 47:34.895
it sounds so corny, man.

47:34.895 --> 47:35.806
You know what I mean?

47:35.806 --> 47:37.954
It makes it bad for
the people that's good.

47:37.954 --> 47:40.749
'cause you gotta get through
so much corny stuff in order to

47:40.749 --> 47:43.916
get to the real, you know what I mean?

47:45.382 --> 47:46.853
- [Narrator] To make it in show biz,

47:46.853 --> 47:49.873
you need talent, drive and
a solid support system.

47:49.873 --> 47:53.456
Mike Eagle finds his
support in his family.

47:54.740 --> 47:56.981
- [Open Mike Eagle] I met my
wife about six, eight months

47:56.981 --> 47:57.982
after I moved out to LA.

47:57.982 --> 48:00.315
We got married a year later.

48:02.916 --> 48:07.916
Asa is probably the youngest
art rap fan that there is.

48:07.957 --> 48:12.405
And he's a serious fan in
the sense of fanaticism.

48:12.405 --> 48:17.007
His favorite rappers are
Serengeti, MF Doom, Busdriver.

48:17.007 --> 48:18.424
And sometimes me.

48:22.189 --> 48:23.950
He enjoys beats.

48:23.950 --> 48:26.878
He doesn't even know what he's doing yet

48:26.878 --> 48:27.983
in really any sense,

48:27.983 --> 48:30.387
but he really enjoys emulating

48:30.387 --> 48:34.887
and trying to do what he can
in terms of making music.

48:38.533 --> 48:40.283

48:47.637 --> 48:49.504

48:52.115 --> 48:52.948
We share it.

48:52.948 --> 48:53.781
- Yeah.

48:53.781 --> 48:54.614
- Cool.

48:54.614 --> 48:59.332
- We should share it
because that's a good idea.

48:59.332 --> 49:00.165
- Okay.

49:00.165 --> 49:02.155
You gonna, you gonna rap

- Very good.

49:34.365 --> 49:35.486
- You're turn to do rap.

49:35.486 --> 49:37.502
- He's very observant

49:37.502 --> 49:39.996
and he learns things really fast.

49:39.996 --> 49:42.086
So him watching videos,

49:42.086 --> 49:44.562
these things are really
imprinting into his mind

49:44.562 --> 49:46.566
and it's gonna be really
interesting to see

49:46.566 --> 49:48.284
how that affects his development.

49:48.284 --> 49:50.534
As a little weirdo rap kid,

49:52.146 --> 49:54.373
I would like him to do, you know,

49:54.373 --> 49:55.421
whatever makes him happy.

49:55.421 --> 49:56.796
I know it's a cliche answer,

49:56.796 --> 49:58.827
but if music doesn't make him happy,

49:58.827 --> 50:00.556
then I wouldn't want him to do music.

50:00.556 --> 50:02.560
And I don't have any
problem with him doing music

50:02.560 --> 50:03.893
if he wanted to.

50:04.893 --> 50:07.593
The only thing in the world I
really worry about him doing

50:07.593 --> 50:08.426
is playing football.

50:08.426 --> 50:09.743
That's the only thing.

50:09.743 --> 50:11.923
'cause I like, I dunno, as a parent,

50:11.923 --> 50:14.730
there's just certain things you
can't even see the same way.

50:14.730 --> 50:15.701
And you watch football,

50:15.701 --> 50:18.494
it's guys look like
they're getting hit by cars

50:18.494 --> 50:19.658
and it's just other people.

50:19.658 --> 50:20.491
Oh no.

50:20.491 --> 50:24.227
So other than that,
down whatever, whatever.

50:24.227 --> 50:26.894
I'm down for it. Down, whatever.

50:46.537 --> 50:48.301
- [Narrator] The God Rakim says,

50:48.301 --> 50:49.540
it ain't where you come from.

50:49.540 --> 50:50.705
It's where you're at.

50:50.705 --> 50:53.005
But where you came from
has a lot to do with

50:53.005 --> 50:54.588
where you're going.

50:57.164 --> 51:00.292
- For me, like my whole
family is musicians.

51:00.292 --> 51:02.010
I never really had a question

51:02.010 --> 51:04.533
about whether or not I
was gonna be a rockstar

51:04.533 --> 51:08.522
or whether not I was gonna
be a musician, you know,

51:08.522 --> 51:10.208
I just saw it. I was around it.

51:10.208 --> 51:13.759
I was, you know, on the
studio floor as a little kid.

51:13.759 --> 51:18.318
So it just seemed like the
only option that made sense.

51:18.318 --> 51:19.646
And you know,

51:19.646 --> 51:22.020
here I am still chipping
away at it, you know.

51:22.020 --> 51:26.917
I don't know if it was like a
specific moment that made me

51:26.917 --> 51:29.082
realize how big the
battling thing could be

51:29.082 --> 51:31.126
and that that could be a ticket.

51:31.126 --> 51:34.400
But it was like a time period when YouTube

51:34.400 --> 51:35.443
had first come out.

51:35.443 --> 51:38.716
And I wasn't doing any
self-promotion beyond,

51:38.716 --> 51:41.284
yo, let me battle, let me
battle this guy, let me do this,

51:41.284 --> 51:42.942
you know, at the same time making songs,

51:42.942 --> 51:45.451
making beats and just trying
to get my name out there.

51:45.451 --> 51:47.482
And then all of a sudden, you know,

51:47.482 --> 51:52.482
I got videos on YouTube that
have, you know, 10,000, 20,000,

51:52.668 --> 51:54.246
60,000, 80,000.

51:54.246 --> 51:55.441
And then I, you know,

51:55.441 --> 51:57.965
broke 100,000 views on
some videos on YouTube

51:57.965 --> 52:00.532
and like, you know, that was crazy.

52:00.532 --> 52:01.978
And then people started recognizing me.

52:01.978 --> 52:03.563
That was the moment, you know.

52:03.563 --> 52:05.608
Just realizing the power of the internet

52:05.608 --> 52:07.204
and the power of word of mouth.

52:07.204 --> 52:10.806
And I didn't even do
anything to promote it,

52:10.806 --> 52:11.971
you know what I mean?

52:11.971 --> 52:13.166
It just had a life of its own.

52:13.166 --> 52:15.197
- You know, you're on a big
stage, there's a lot of money.

52:15.197 --> 52:16.152
It's stake like $10,000, $5,000.

52:16.152 --> 52:20.258
You know. Also there's
probably 600 to 1000 people

52:20.258 --> 52:22.006
watching every single round.

52:22.006 --> 52:26.483
You know, 32nd rounds probably
about eight to 12 bars

52:26.483 --> 52:27.890
depending on the speed of the beat.

52:27.890 --> 52:31.190
So you would probably
have four lines in there

52:31.190 --> 52:33.789
in each round for every person.

52:33.789 --> 52:37.032
And you knew because
there was preliminaries

52:37.032 --> 52:41.199
in every major city you
knew who won those battles

52:42.166 --> 52:42.999
in every city.

52:42.999 --> 52:45.108
And you'd have a month
to just get lines ready.

52:45.108 --> 52:48.617
You get there that day
and you see who you see.

52:48.617 --> 52:50.779
It's a room like this. And
you see, oh, I know that,

52:50.779 --> 52:51.612
da da da da da da.

52:51.612 --> 52:55.352
Sometimes there's like a
random guy that no one knows.

52:55.352 --> 52:57.843
But most of the times like,
oh, I've seen him at a cipher.

52:57.843 --> 53:00.370
I've seen him at a battle.
I've seen him at a show.

53:00.370 --> 53:01.203
Like,

53:01.203 --> 53:03.133
you know who you're going up
against and you immediately,

53:03.133 --> 53:05.163
you know, think of stuff for that person.

53:05.163 --> 53:07.537
So you have like a lead
in or something like that.

53:07.537 --> 53:08.777
Or you think of a punchline,

53:08.777 --> 53:10.987
what we call a pre-med or
a premeditated punchline.

53:10.987 --> 53:13.479
And then you would just,
you know, go no safety net.

53:13.479 --> 53:15.497
Or sometimes if you felt really cocky,

53:15.497 --> 53:16.513
if I felt really cocky,

53:16.513 --> 53:17.842
it was just no safety net

53:17.842 --> 53:19.858
and I would just rip the
person apart on things

53:19.858 --> 53:21.008
that I noticed at the moment

53:21.008 --> 53:22.087
and just start playing with the crowd.

53:22.087 --> 53:22.920

or different like leagues or
whatever you wanna call it

54:51.235 --> 54:53.789
where people have battled over the years.

59:05.445 --> 59:07.162

a decision to basically,

59:35.790 --> 59:36.684
you know,

not just kicking a rhyme but
making it up on the spot.

01:02:30.673 --> 01:02:32.736
Complete improvisation.

01:02:32.736 --> 01:02:36.273
And it all started on Crenshaw Boulevard.

01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:38.307
- Alright, right now we're
right in the middle of

01:02:38.307 --> 01:02:39.140
Leimert Park.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.502
We're on the 43rd place
in Leimert Boulevard.

01:02:41.502 --> 01:02:43.160
And Leimert Park has been a place

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.952
where throughout LA's history,

01:02:45.952 --> 01:02:48.909
Leimert Park has always kind of housed

01:02:48.909 --> 01:02:49.839
all the black culture.

01:02:49.839 --> 01:02:51.881
And it's been a place where
people have been able to come

01:02:51.881 --> 01:02:53.539
and jam on all different types of genres.

01:02:53.539 --> 01:02:56.510
And right here in particular
at this Building KAOS Network,

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:57.824
this is where that's happened.

01:02:57.824 --> 01:02:59.392
On the rap side of things.

01:02:59.392 --> 01:03:01.092
Well The Good Life is where it all began.

01:03:01.092 --> 01:03:02.170
And that was,

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:04.559
you know, maybe a mile
down the way from here.

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:06.770
- Right across the street is The Good Life

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:07.815
where it all started man.

01:03:07.815 --> 01:03:09.099
- [Duane Earle] What's up you guys?

01:03:09.099 --> 01:03:11.144
You're at my restaurant Earle's Grill.

01:03:11.144 --> 01:03:13.161
We're on Crenshaw and Exposition.

01:03:13.161 --> 01:03:16.890
Been in the community 27 years
for those of you who know our

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:18.297
career and our history.

01:03:18.297 --> 01:03:20.893
We started with a hot dog cart back in 86.

01:03:20.893 --> 01:03:21.956
In the music industry,

01:03:21.956 --> 01:03:24.374
I was fortunate to have
been signed with Ice Cube.

01:03:24.374 --> 01:03:27.750
I was very fortunate to
have been do ghost writing

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:28.811
for Eazy-E.

01:03:28.811 --> 01:03:31.484
And I was very one of the
few fortunate artists to even

01:03:31.484 --> 01:03:33.679
venture into a place called The Good Life.

01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:36.621
It was one of the only few
venues that even attempted to

01:03:36.621 --> 01:03:39.532
showcase and highlight what
was really going on in the

01:03:39.532 --> 01:03:41.086
LA underground scene.

01:03:41.086 --> 01:03:43.639
- It was already a health
food store directly across the

01:03:43.639 --> 01:03:46.731
street, but it was on B. Hall and her son.

01:03:46.731 --> 01:03:50.076
Like this whole area has
always been dedicated

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.107
to trying to keep the youth from all that.

01:03:52.107 --> 01:03:53.824
The projects is right there, The Jungles.

01:03:53.824 --> 01:03:55.347
It's right there up the way,

01:03:55.347 --> 01:03:57.556
you know it's jungles
like it's gang bangs here.

01:03:57.556 --> 01:03:58.389
Like shit.

01:03:58.389 --> 01:03:59.961
She gave us a spot to come

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:03.044
and say meet the other kids like you.

01:04:03.918 --> 01:04:06.052
This is what, and she enforced.

01:04:06.052 --> 01:04:09.217
No cursing, no battling on
each other, no, none of that.

01:04:09.217 --> 01:04:10.624
If you gotta beef handle that.

01:04:10.624 --> 01:04:13.700
But no cursing, no cuss, no
mamas, no nothing, no nothing.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.761
No gangs, no nothing like,

01:04:15.761 --> 01:04:18.928
and that's when this turned into like,

01:04:20.212 --> 01:04:23.526
fuck a gang nigga I'm
going to the Good Life.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:27.170
- It was a place too where
different hoods met up

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:28.141
where you know,

01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:30.172
there could be some gang banging activity

01:04:30.172 --> 01:04:31.366
and things of that nature.

01:04:31.366 --> 01:04:32.558
I wondered myself,

01:04:32.558 --> 01:04:36.085
what was the magnetism of
Crenshaw in general around that

01:04:36.085 --> 01:04:36.918
Crenshaw, King,

01:04:36.918 --> 01:04:39.695
that Leimert Park area to where
from the early jazz days of

01:04:39.695 --> 01:04:41.743
world stage, Billy Higgins on through,

01:04:41.743 --> 01:04:42.820
you know,

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.647
people that claim Leimert Park now,

01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:47.166
Project Blowed, you know,

01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:48.883
the Kendrick Lamar

01:04:48.883 --> 01:04:52.853
Terrence Martin is just all
these talented people that stem.

01:04:52.853 --> 01:04:54.886
And I think it's because
of the different artistry

01:04:54.886 --> 01:04:57.992
and the culture that fed off each other.

01:04:57.992 --> 01:05:01.248
Like I feel like I'm a better
MC because of my jazz things,

01:05:01.248 --> 01:05:03.637
the musicians and, and
the theoretical approach.

01:05:03.637 --> 01:05:06.114
- [Pigeon John] When I
went there I realized, man,

01:05:06.114 --> 01:05:08.236
there's everyone's great.

01:05:08.236 --> 01:05:09.222
I need to step on my game.

01:05:09.222 --> 01:05:12.000
So I went there every
week and just dove in.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.282
I got booed off the stage a lot of times,

01:05:14.282 --> 01:05:17.182
but I just wanted to
learn how to, you know,

01:05:17.182 --> 01:05:20.646
rock a crowd to give a good show

01:05:20.646 --> 01:05:22.244
to be my own personality,

01:05:22.244 --> 01:05:24.499
but kind of please the people,

01:05:24.499 --> 01:05:25.529
but kind of like,

01:05:25.529 --> 01:05:26.709
oh man that dude is dope.

01:05:26.709 --> 01:05:28.755
So it was, I just dove into it.

01:05:28.755 --> 01:05:30.398
- [Crooked I] If you ever
went to The Good Life,

01:05:30.398 --> 01:05:31.906
if you ever went to Leimert Park,

01:05:31.906 --> 01:05:35.042
all you've seen was people
snapping on people battling

01:05:35.042 --> 01:05:36.593
everybody's circles over here,

01:05:36.593 --> 01:05:38.148
circles over there on stage,

01:05:38.148 --> 01:05:39.343
people getting booed.

01:05:39.343 --> 01:05:40.433
Please pass the mic.

01:05:40.433 --> 01:05:42.673
Gangsta rappers that's really gang banging

01:05:42.673 --> 01:05:43.838
with pistols on 'em.

01:05:43.838 --> 01:05:46.765
Rapping on stage and people
being scared to tell 'em to pass

01:05:46.765 --> 01:05:48.855
the mic 'cause they think they
gonna get shot or something.

01:05:48.855 --> 01:05:51.021
Like that whole scene deserves a movie.

01:05:51.021 --> 01:05:55.438
- This right here, this was
The Good Life right here.

01:05:57.415 --> 01:05:59.771
They done changed it.

01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:02.041
It ain't even deep in
there like it used to be.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.655
It used to go all the
way back to the back.

01:06:04.655 --> 01:06:06.572
This was The Good Life.

01:06:08.373 --> 01:06:10.790
This is where peace was born.

01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:14.233
This is where my life changed.

01:06:15.198 --> 01:06:18.115
This is where we changed your life.

01:06:20.682 --> 01:06:22.754
- [Narrator] To make it in
the current rap battle arena,

01:06:22.754 --> 01:06:25.606
you need skills, punchlines and talent.

01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:28.829
You also need to be willing
to be humiliated in public.

01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:32.386
Not everyone is cut out
for the battle circuit.

01:06:32.386 --> 01:06:34.790
- This is the legendary Pyramid Club.

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:37.493
This is the Lower East Side
Manhattan, lower East Side.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.106
A lot of history.

01:06:39.106 --> 01:06:41.689
Classic New York Pyramid
Club in particular.

01:06:41.689 --> 01:06:44.360
You know, a lot of upcoming acts,

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.378
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Madonna,

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:48.857
pretty much everybody
in that scene coming up,

01:06:48.857 --> 01:06:50.960
would perform here, you know what I mean?

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.995
And now it's the home of the
longest running weekly open mic

01:06:53.995 --> 01:06:57.429
in New York City end of the
weak, End of the W-E-A-K,

01:06:57.429 --> 01:07:00.386
which is also every Sunday night.

01:07:00.386 --> 01:07:01.864
They do freestyle competitions.

01:07:01.864 --> 01:07:06.075
They do, you know,
showcases, perform a song.

01:07:06.075 --> 01:07:07.360
You know, spit a verse.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.004
The dj, they do a competition
called the MC challenge

01:07:12.004 --> 01:07:16.825
where the first round you
spit like a written verse

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:17.753
with punchlines.

01:07:17.753 --> 01:07:21.726
Second round you spit
a acapella, you know,

01:07:21.726 --> 01:07:25.721
something personal, something meaningful.

01:07:25.721 --> 01:07:28.998
Maybe third round you spit is a freestyle

01:07:28.998 --> 01:07:29.984
grab bag round.

01:07:29.984 --> 01:07:32.582
You have a bag or a box
of items that you reach in

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:34.837
and pull out items that
have to be spontaneous

01:07:34.837 --> 01:07:36.897
and put 'em together.

01:07:36.897 --> 01:07:40.616
You know, fourth round is beat juggling.

01:07:40.616 --> 01:07:43.857
So DJ will be playing some
regular boombap hip hop shit

01:07:43.857 --> 01:07:45.858
and then all of a sudden switch it up.

01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:47.083
It'll be some double time,

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:51.010
southern, something crazy and
it might be Britney Spears

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:53.041
or Michael Jackson and you
gotta just keep rapping

01:07:53.041 --> 01:07:54.175
and not miss a beat.

01:07:54.175 --> 01:07:55.774
You know, stick with the flow.

01:07:55.774 --> 01:07:58.940
And then the last round is the
cipher skills where you gotta

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.956
play off of somebody else's energy

01:08:00.956 --> 01:08:03.327
and show that you can
count bars, you know,

01:08:03.327 --> 01:08:05.630
and then go off the last thing they said.

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:07.228
So as opposed to a battle,

01:08:07.228 --> 01:08:10.734
which shows your only shows
your battle ability, you know,

01:08:10.734 --> 01:08:13.425
as an MC, the MC
challenge shows, you know,

01:08:13.425 --> 01:08:16.128
a much more well-rounded
picture of you as an MC.

01:08:16.128 --> 01:08:18.949
Freestyle shit, written
shit, punchline stuff.

01:08:18.949 --> 01:08:20.070
More meaningful stuff.

01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:25.070
So something that's a holdover
from an era in New York where

01:08:25.339 --> 01:08:27.656
this kind of event was
important, you know what I mean?

01:08:27.656 --> 01:08:29.687
And it still is important
because this is one of the only

01:08:29.687 --> 01:08:32.075
ones that really is
doing it the way that it,

01:08:32.075 --> 01:08:34.254
it was done in the way
it's supposed to be done.

01:08:34.254 --> 01:08:35.087
You know,

01:08:35.087 --> 01:08:37.094
people rapping outside,
people rapping inside,

01:08:37.094 --> 01:08:38.005
you know what I mean?

01:08:38.005 --> 01:08:39.922
It's hip hop, you know.

01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:45.382
- The Good Life was more,
let's just say for seniors,

01:08:45.382 --> 01:08:47.398
let's just say seniors.

01:08:47.398 --> 01:08:48.653
Well we started this here.

01:08:48.653 --> 01:08:51.681
There was a whole nother kind of young MC

01:08:51.681 --> 01:08:55.343
coming up right up under our feet.

01:08:55.343 --> 01:08:56.176
We saw this,

01:08:56.176 --> 01:08:59.270
we knew this like we gotta do something.

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:00.103
Acey said,

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:01.990
well you know what?

01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:03.323
I want a battle.

01:09:04.386 --> 01:09:06.765
I wanna be able to cuss
this nigga the fuck out

01:09:06.765 --> 01:09:07.630
if I want to.

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:09.051
We couldn't do that there.

01:09:09.051 --> 01:09:09.963
That's Mecca.

01:09:09.963 --> 01:09:10.796
That's epicenter.

01:09:10.796 --> 01:09:11.629
No,

01:09:11.629 --> 01:09:13.963
let's go down the street and
still keep it in the hood.

01:09:13.963 --> 01:09:16.036
And I get my own and I
can cuss this fool out

01:09:16.036 --> 01:09:17.039
the way I want to.

01:09:17.039 --> 01:09:18.783
Now that's the difference
between The Good Life

01:09:18.783 --> 01:09:21.592
and Project Blowed, same
theory, same ethics.

01:09:21.592 --> 01:09:22.425
It's just,

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:23.759
I could whip your ass here

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:25.372
and I can't whip your right there.

01:09:25.372 --> 01:09:26.851
- [Verbs] Lyric's Lounge had came out

01:09:26.851 --> 01:09:28.493
when I was like in high school

01:09:28.493 --> 01:09:30.791
back when I first started
using the internet.

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:32.227
And I was like, man,

01:09:32.227 --> 01:09:34.526
I wanna find something like
that in the west coast.

01:09:34.526 --> 01:09:36.587
And I just did Google searches

01:09:36.587 --> 01:09:38.032
and then I heard of Project Blowed,

01:09:38.032 --> 01:09:40.631
then my brother told me there
was something in Leimert Park

01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:42.680
that happens every Tuesday when I was 17,

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.890
I went for the first time.

01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:46.264
Then when I graduated my graduation night,

01:09:46.264 --> 01:09:47.518
I went there late at night.

01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:48.920
There was only four people there.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.937
But I ended up rapping the
shows that Project Blowed

01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:51.834
were in KAOS Network.

01:09:51.834 --> 01:09:53.058
Like, you know, 4343.

01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:55.418
It was like on the corner,
these people rapping,

01:09:55.418 --> 01:09:59.092
drinking forties, stress
blunts, Crips, weirdos,

01:09:59.092 --> 01:10:00.358
all in between.

01:10:00.358 --> 01:10:01.191
You know.

01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:05.244
- The interesting thing there
was watching people's styles

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:07.395
develop while challenging those rules,

01:10:07.395 --> 01:10:09.978
but remaining inside of that
structure where once you got to

01:10:09.978 --> 01:10:13.769
Project Blowed here in 96
when the AC alone and AB Rule

01:10:13.769 --> 01:10:15.816
brought it here they brought it here

01:10:15.816 --> 01:10:18.233
and collaborated with Ben
Caldwell who owns the spot.

01:10:18.233 --> 01:10:21.431
And one of the things that
they wanted to do was create a

01:10:21.431 --> 01:10:22.537
spot with no rules at all.

01:10:22.537 --> 01:10:25.076
- [Ben Caldwell] I am the owner
and director of this place called

01:10:25.076 --> 01:10:26.243
KAOS Network.

01:10:27.496 --> 01:10:32.139
We initially named this place
KAOS Network because in 1984

01:10:32.139 --> 01:10:35.126
I started this as a computer matrix,

01:10:35.126 --> 01:10:36.603
kind of a thinking concept.

01:10:36.603 --> 01:10:40.576
We were connecting five
community centers together.

01:10:40.576 --> 01:10:43.459
And then I started working with
these youth trying to figure

01:10:43.459 --> 01:10:47.371
out is there a free way to
work with them by sitting up a

01:10:47.371 --> 01:10:50.204
neutral zone where they can create

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:55.838
and nurture what I call the avant-garde.

01:10:55.838 --> 01:10:58.270
- So any kind of language,
any kind of rap styles,

01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:59.466
really any kind of content.

01:10:59.466 --> 01:11:01.976
And the only structure
imposed was the crowd

01:11:01.976 --> 01:11:04.589
being able to say, please pass the mic.

01:11:04.589 --> 01:11:07.559
And that that to call somebody
to have to get off stage like

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:09.741
Apollo style, you know?

01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:14.741
And so it was the onus for
creating the structure was all on

01:11:14.759 --> 01:11:16.506
the crowd and happened to be a crowd

01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:17.925
full of really awesome rappers.

01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:19.896
So the bar, the quality was really high.

01:11:19.896 --> 01:11:21.970
And that created this kind of atmosphere.

01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:24.898
People challenging each other
to try to take this thing as

01:11:24.898 --> 01:11:26.959
far as they can go and
really explore and push the

01:11:26.959 --> 01:11:27.960
boundaries of rap.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.627
- Leimerk is like Chocolate City

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:32.870
and to the center of LA

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:36.606
It's like if you an
artist, if you into jazz,

01:11:36.606 --> 01:11:38.981
if you are a musician, if
you are a break dancer,

01:11:38.981 --> 01:11:41.787
if you a B-boy, if you
do Graffiti, any of that,

01:11:41.787 --> 01:11:43.804
this is where you would go.

01:11:43.804 --> 01:11:45.820
- You know how like in Greece they would

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.270
like throw people in the
coliseum with wild animals

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:51.316
and like you'd have to like
fight for your survival.

01:11:51.316 --> 01:11:53.466
You have to like come back
with the skull of the animal.

01:11:53.466 --> 01:11:54.915
It's kind of one of those kinds of things.

01:11:54.915 --> 01:11:57.795
Everybody is really dope and
really aggressive, right?

01:11:57.795 --> 01:12:01.261
So as soon as you step foot
on that corner, 4343 Leimerk

01:12:01.261 --> 01:12:02.725
people are coming at your head

01:12:02.725 --> 01:12:05.413
and you have to get your skills
up just to defend yourself.

01:12:05.413 --> 01:12:06.249
You know what I mean?

01:12:06.249 --> 01:12:08.293
And then we all come out
of the Blowed Academy

01:12:08.293 --> 01:12:09.579
like little monsters, you know.

01:12:09.579 --> 01:12:11.595
- There's a lot of similar
styles from Good Life.

01:12:11.595 --> 01:12:13.865
But there was a generational
thing that started to develop

01:12:13.865 --> 01:12:17.031
too in Project Blowed where
younger MCs hung out with each

01:12:17.031 --> 01:12:19.256
other and those younger
MCs, other than them like,

01:12:19.256 --> 01:12:20.523
I don't know how many
generations we have now.

01:12:20.523 --> 01:12:24.256
I think it's like three,
four different generations.

- Project Blowed remains
more of a mainstay

01:13:27.353 --> 01:13:29.400
for LA West Coast sound,

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.655
underground hip hop sound,

01:13:31.655 --> 01:13:34.328
which has definitely carried
hip hop a lot through the years

01:13:34.328 --> 01:13:35.926
period.

01:13:35.926 --> 01:13:38.136
(hip hop beat)

01:13:38.136 --> 01:13:42.225
- The Blowed was a thing
for the 90s and early 2000s.

01:13:42.225 --> 01:13:43.691
What's ended up happening though,

01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:47.290
is this rapper Verbs from
my crew to Swim Team.

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:49.321
He started this night called Bananas,

01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:51.397
which is a monthly and it
is created this kind of

01:13:51.397 --> 01:13:53.756
eclectic mixed bag kind of feel.

01:13:53.756 --> 01:13:55.787
It's a little bit more
appropriate for the times.

01:13:55.787 --> 01:13:57.818
- My name is Verbs.

01:13:57.818 --> 01:13:59.207
We got DJ Tony smooth

01:13:59.207 --> 01:14:00.387
DJ L Ray in the house.

01:14:00.387 --> 01:14:01.698
This is Bananas

01:14:01.698 --> 01:14:03.104
We do it every third Tuesday.

01:14:03.104 --> 01:14:05.778
Yeah man, it's gonna get
started real soon man.

01:14:05.778 --> 01:14:08.182
Got a bunch of cool people
performing and shit.

01:14:08.182 --> 01:14:09.048
I was,

01:14:09.048 --> 01:14:10.228
I had a girlfriend at the time

01:14:10.228 --> 01:14:12.705
and she was taking me to places
in other parts of the city,

01:14:12.705 --> 01:14:14.066
like Echo Park with Silver Lake,

01:14:14.066 --> 01:14:16.274
downtown house shows all sorts of shit.

01:14:16.274 --> 01:14:17.913
And then she had the idea like, yo,

01:14:17.913 --> 01:14:19.169
I wanna throw an event here.

01:14:19.169 --> 01:14:20.267
She's like you show me book rappers

01:14:20.267 --> 01:14:21.100
and I'll book bands.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.588
And Project Blowed was still going on.

01:14:22.588 --> 01:14:23.723
So, you know, I was like, yo,

01:14:23.723 --> 01:14:24.556
we could do it in Leimert.

01:14:24.556 --> 01:14:25.389
Like,

01:14:25.389 --> 01:14:26.960
Ben's all about some pro
black young people shit.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.126
Let's do this. Whatever.

01:14:28.126 --> 01:14:30.334
I tried to make it like
a festival once a month,

01:14:30.334 --> 01:14:31.795
every third Tuesday.

01:14:31.795 --> 01:14:33.288
That's the vibe I would try to go for

01:14:33.288 --> 01:14:35.110
because it is a big homie fest man.

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:36.511
And you know, yeah.

01:14:36.511 --> 01:14:39.426
- I think the movement
that they're doing now

01:14:39.426 --> 01:14:40.515
hasn't been labeled.

01:14:40.515 --> 01:14:42.562
You know, I don't think it has a name.

01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:44.697
I don't think hipster explains it.

01:14:44.697 --> 01:14:46.743
I don't think hip hop really explains it.

01:14:46.743 --> 01:14:51.566
And so I think what we're
seeing now with Bananas

01:14:51.566 --> 01:14:53.747
is a hip hop broth

01:14:53.747 --> 01:14:56.497
with the gumbo not described yet.

01:14:57.361 --> 01:14:58.750
(laughs)

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:01.833
(funky hip hop beat)

01:15:07.679 --> 01:15:09.738
- [Narrator] They say the
key to success in any field

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.958
is 10,000 hours practice.

01:15:11.958 --> 01:15:13.265
Yes.

01:15:13.265 --> 01:15:14.923
It is only through intense hard work

01:15:14.923 --> 01:15:19.698
and repetition that a person
could truly achieve greatness.

01:15:19.698 --> 01:15:22.281
- And now we're go to St. James

01:15:23.169 --> 01:15:25.883
between Fulton and Gates
where Biggie grew up.

01:15:25.883 --> 01:15:28.633
I think my top rappers are Jay-Z,

01:15:29.741 --> 01:15:32.527
Eminem, Tupac, and Biggie.

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:33.632
Definitely Biggie.

01:15:33.632 --> 01:15:35.172
I like to go there sometimes.

01:15:35.172 --> 01:15:36.365
Just, you know,

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.562
eat some McDonald's in
front of Biggie's crib.

01:15:38.562 --> 01:15:40.607
Yeah, this is the one right here.

01:15:40.607 --> 01:15:42.280
226 St. James,

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.490
Clinton the Hill right next to Bed-Stuy

01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:47.088
This is where Biggie Smalls,

01:15:47.088 --> 01:15:49.940
Chris Wallace was born and raised.

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:50.911
This is the neighborhood.

01:15:50.911 --> 01:15:52.117
All the stories that he's telling

01:15:52.117 --> 01:15:55.361
and the situations he's describing.

01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:56.269
It's here.

01:15:56.269 --> 01:15:57.198
It all happened here.

01:15:57.198 --> 01:15:59.302
You know, I think that Biggie was,

01:15:59.302 --> 01:16:00.135
you know,

01:16:00.135 --> 01:16:03.112
he brought like a level of
honesty that you didn't always

01:16:03.112 --> 01:16:05.158
see at that time.

01:16:05.158 --> 01:16:10.158
You know, he obviously had
the grandiose narratives and,

01:16:10.278 --> 01:16:13.072
you know, just larger
than life stuff going on.

01:16:13.072 --> 01:16:16.609
But he was also being a hundred
percent extremely honest

01:16:16.609 --> 01:16:17.836
about the struggle

01:16:17.836 --> 01:16:19.942
and the frustration or the pain

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:22.152
or whatever difficulties
he was going through.

01:16:22.152 --> 01:16:24.825
I think Biggie being here
and the neighborhood changing

01:16:24.825 --> 01:16:27.244
and evolving and certain
elements stand the same.

01:16:27.244 --> 01:16:28.095
You know, it,

01:16:28.095 --> 01:16:30.812
it's that same dichotomy that
he represented when he was

01:16:30.812 --> 01:16:32.844
alive of the Every man, the struggle.

01:16:32.844 --> 01:16:35.786
But something bigger and grandiose

01:16:35.786 --> 01:16:37.875
and possibility and change,

01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:40.039
but also a constant, you know,

01:16:40.039 --> 01:16:42.070
Biggie's still here.

01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:43.133
You know what I mean?

01:16:43.133 --> 01:16:45.505
Projects are still here,
funeral home's still here.

01:16:45.505 --> 01:16:47.807
A lot of things change and a
lot of things stay the same.

01:16:47.807 --> 01:16:50.435
So you see, you see the past
in the present, you know,

01:16:50.435 --> 01:16:53.318
and Biggie's the past and the
present right now, you know,

01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:55.690
and the future because he's
gonna continue to influence

01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:57.708
and inspire younger generations.

01:16:57.708 --> 01:17:00.678
And there's probably a kid
in that project building

01:17:00.678 --> 01:17:02.711
right now writing rhymes at his desk,

01:17:02.711 --> 01:17:04.783
looking out the window at the Biggie mural

01:17:04.783 --> 01:17:06.862
And this might be how he found
out about Biggie was because

01:17:06.862 --> 01:17:08.908
he saw his face on this wall.

01:17:08.908 --> 01:17:11.790
And so now Big's the future again.

01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:13.177
You know.

01:17:13.177 --> 01:17:16.844
(funky hip hop music fades)

01:17:18.429 --> 01:17:20.454
- [Narrator] Just like a freestyle

01:17:20.454 --> 01:17:22.798
life could be a series of quick decisions

01:17:22.798 --> 01:17:24.259
and spontaneous reactions.

01:17:24.259 --> 01:17:27.024
When the MC miss steps,
we call it falling off.

01:17:27.024 --> 01:17:29.069
You could fall off in a rhyme.

01:17:29.069 --> 01:17:30.504
You could fall off in life.

01:17:30.504 --> 01:17:32.072
It's all about the decision

01:17:32.072 --> 01:17:33.729
you're forced to make on the spot.

(record scratch)

01:17:55.159 --> 01:17:58.326
- I am doing a massive merch mail out.

01:17:59.694 --> 01:18:03.241
We had a little financial hardship at home

01:18:03.241 --> 01:18:06.510
and so printed up a special edition

01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:08.598
in one of my CDs that had never been

01:18:08.598 --> 01:18:10.431
available in that way.

01:18:11.916 --> 01:18:14.249
It was a EP I put out before

01:18:16.424 --> 01:18:18.576
and put 'em in a cool little package,

01:18:18.576 --> 01:18:20.320
little floppy disc cover for the cd.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.172
I pressed up a hundred
in this floppy disc case,

01:18:24.172 --> 01:18:25.755
this particular EP.

01:18:27.016 --> 01:18:31.611
And I've sold about 50 since
I announced it last week.

01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:33.611
This one's from Georgia.

01:18:35.543 --> 01:18:39.043
Got an order from London, Ontario, Canada.

01:18:41.456 --> 01:18:43.696
Got an order from England on here.

01:18:43.696 --> 01:18:46.145
Lots of places all over California.

01:18:46.145 --> 01:18:48.295
Got an order from Australia on here.

01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:53.212
The Netherlands, East Coast,
Baltimore, Madison, Wisconsin.

01:18:56.236 --> 01:19:00.899
Got a pretty good, pretty
good variety of locales.

01:19:00.899 --> 01:19:03.226
I don't have a day job now.

01:19:03.226 --> 01:19:05.302
I have a little hustle though,

01:19:05.302 --> 01:19:09.889
like I do graphic design sometimes
I can make a little money

01:19:09.889 --> 01:19:11.099
on the side that way too.

01:19:11.099 --> 01:19:14.130
But most of my income comes
from music related stuff.

01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:15.624
You know,

01:19:15.624 --> 01:19:17.879
it's not too far out of the
range of anything that I would

01:19:17.879 --> 01:19:19.387
actually be doing.

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:22.956
Sometimes things get hard and, you know,

01:19:22.956 --> 01:19:24.285
I end up looking on Craigslist

01:19:24.285 --> 01:19:25.674
'cause I used to be a teacher.

01:19:25.674 --> 01:19:28.586
So I got a lot of experience with kids.

01:19:28.586 --> 01:19:30.841
I got like, you know, I got a
college degree and all that.

01:19:30.841 --> 01:19:32.872
So occasionally things get bad enough.

01:19:32.872 --> 01:19:34.903
I'm on Craigslist looking
to see what I can do.

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:37.236
But the realistic, you know,

01:19:38.964 --> 01:19:41.309
when it comes down to
the practicality of it,

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:44.490
I gotta get something that
allows me to be able to travel.

01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:46.939
'cause I make a good amount
of money on the road.

01:19:46.939 --> 01:19:51.090
So it's always tough for me
to envision what a real job

01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:54.167
would be like when it comes to budgeting.

01:19:54.167 --> 01:19:57.407
Like I can pretty accurately say

01:19:57.407 --> 01:19:59.763
what I'm gonna bring home from a tour.

01:19:59.763 --> 01:20:04.430
And I can pretty confidently
say I'll tour twice a year.

01:20:05.717 --> 01:20:08.050
So that much I can count on.

01:20:09.635 --> 01:20:11.594
Other than that, it's really difficult.

01:20:11.594 --> 01:20:14.371
- Anybody that wants to
be their own business,

01:20:14.371 --> 01:20:17.926
you have to believe I'm
the best and I can do it.

01:20:17.926 --> 01:20:19.969
Because if you don't, I mean,

01:20:19.969 --> 01:20:21.987
everybody else is getting
a job, going to college

01:20:21.987 --> 01:20:24.018
to work for somebody else.

01:20:24.018 --> 01:20:26.811
So entrepreneurs have
to believe I can do it.

01:20:26.811 --> 01:20:27.794
I'm gonna make it.

01:20:27.794 --> 01:20:29.350
If you think anything different,

01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:32.931
you're not gonna give 110%
and you probably will fail.

01:20:32.931 --> 01:20:35.248
You give up when you're dead, you know?

01:20:35.248 --> 01:20:37.667
And biting a bullet is
you do what you can until,

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:40.878
but if it's your passion,
I'm a firm believer,

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:43.787
some people aren't cut out for this.

01:20:43.787 --> 01:20:45.239
So if it's not really your passion

01:20:45.239 --> 01:20:46.732
and you think, yeah, I'm the rapper

01:20:46.732 --> 01:20:47.565
and I deserve everything,

01:20:47.565 --> 01:20:49.271
then you are in the wrong business.

01:20:49.271 --> 01:20:51.540
- [Narrator] Building a
reputation that precedes you

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.153
can be a blessing and a curse.

01:20:53.153 --> 01:20:54.554
For Iron Solomon,

01:20:54.554 --> 01:20:58.110
one wonders if his notoriety
as a battle rapper has started

01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:59.692
to restrain him as a artist.

01:20:59.692 --> 01:21:02.692
(hard hip hop beat)

01:21:03.676 --> 01:21:05.651
- The funny thing about

01:21:05.651 --> 01:21:09.341
the whole battle scene is that
they suffer from being stuck

01:21:09.341 --> 01:21:12.072
in the comfort zone just
as much as anybody else.

01:21:12.072 --> 01:21:14.101
You know, like battling is awesome,

01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:17.254
but it's definitely a step
towards bigger things, you know.

01:21:17.254 --> 01:21:19.553
There's only a few battle
rappers I know that's like,

01:21:19.553 --> 01:21:20.810
that's all they want to do.

01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:23.227
Most of these guys want to
sell millions of records

01:21:23.227 --> 01:21:26.036
and be on TV, music videos,
tons of things like that.

01:21:26.036 --> 01:21:28.052
But they get pulled into the battle scene

01:21:28.052 --> 01:21:30.845
because it's sustained itself to a point

01:21:30.845 --> 01:21:32.906
where you can make some money, you know?

01:21:32.906 --> 01:21:35.818
And it's kind of its own enemy, you know?

01:21:35.818 --> 01:21:37.356
And a lot of these guys,

01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:39.014
they're at the top at one point

01:21:39.014 --> 01:21:41.358
and they continue to battle

01:21:41.358 --> 01:21:43.404
and lose or get served.

01:21:43.404 --> 01:21:45.431
And it's like, and it's a wrap.

01:21:45.431 --> 01:21:46.839
- Being a great freestyler

01:21:46.839 --> 01:21:50.438
and making a record is two
absolutely different things.

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:52.737
A freestyling would be considered to a guy

01:21:52.737 --> 01:21:54.977
that could solo on a guitar,

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:58.009
but if you sat him in
and said make a melody,

01:21:58.009 --> 01:22:00.040
make an arrangement, he couldn't do it.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.757
He can solo his ass off,

01:22:01.757 --> 01:22:04.774
but he can't think of a song.

01:22:04.774 --> 01:22:07.208
- There's certain skills that
if you develop that skill,

01:22:07.208 --> 01:22:11.971
it doesn't translate developing
that skill of delivering

01:22:11.971 --> 01:22:14.566
those lines without the beat.

01:22:14.566 --> 01:22:16.300
And it's, you know,

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.333
like you're tearing somebody down

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:21.245
and it's a very particular skill.

01:22:21.245 --> 01:22:24.545
It doesn't translate
well into other mediums.

01:22:24.545 --> 01:22:26.588
- A lot of these battle
rap freestyle rappers,

01:22:26.588 --> 01:22:28.277
they can't make a album.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:30.698
They don't know how to make an
album. You know what I mean?

01:22:30.698 --> 01:22:32.102
They could have a good battle.

01:22:32.102 --> 01:22:34.118
And a lot of people watch it,

01:22:34.118 --> 01:22:35.850
they'll get a lot of views
if it's on the internet

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:36.761
and stuff like that.

01:22:36.761 --> 01:22:38.356
But when it comes time to make an album,

01:22:38.356 --> 01:22:40.103
it's like they can't deliver,
you know what I mean?

01:22:40.103 --> 01:22:42.391
It's like a different animal.

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:44.720
When you making an album,
it gotta be a package.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.826
It gotta be something
different. You know what I mean?

01:22:46.826 --> 01:22:47.841
- People can freestyle all day.

01:22:47.841 --> 01:22:51.395
That don't mean that they're
artists, you know what I mean?

01:22:51.395 --> 01:22:52.963
You gotta be able to write songs.

01:22:52.963 --> 01:22:54.994
You gotta know when to stop
rhyming sometimes too much

01:22:54.994 --> 01:22:57.039
rhymers, you know, we don't,

01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:59.086
sometimes we don't want
to hit too much rhymes,

01:22:59.086 --> 01:23:01.132
like slow down, you know,
slow that shit down.

01:23:01.132 --> 01:23:02.610
I just wanna sing the song with you.

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:05.073
The reason why the skill
sets are different.

01:23:05.073 --> 01:23:07.225
- Between an individual
that can write a good rap

01:23:07.225 --> 01:23:10.883
or write a good song and someone
that could freestyle well,

01:23:10.883 --> 01:23:13.285
but maybe not be so adept
at making good songs

01:23:13.285 --> 01:23:16.975
is the mechanics of the creative process.

01:23:16.975 --> 01:23:19.530
- Making records is a whole nother zone.

01:23:19.530 --> 01:23:20.706
You gotta make hooks,

01:23:20.706 --> 01:23:23.233
you gotta make things that are very catchy

01:23:23.233 --> 01:23:27.624
and sometimes you have
to dumb down your ability

01:23:27.624 --> 01:23:28.639
to make records.

01:23:28.639 --> 01:23:31.430
- I think there are times where, you know,

01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:35.434
I definitely feel that people
are appreciating me for one

01:23:35.434 --> 01:23:39.241
thing that's just a piece of what I do.

01:23:39.241 --> 01:23:43.617
And they want a very
particular thing from you.

01:23:43.617 --> 01:23:48.617
They don't wanna see Michael
Jordan play baseball, you know?

01:23:49.602 --> 01:23:50.800
And I might do a show

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.130
and the show's going great

01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:55.415
and I do acapellas in between the songs

01:23:55.415 --> 01:23:57.042
because I like to draw people in

01:23:57.042 --> 01:23:58.506
and just switch up the pacing

01:23:58.506 --> 01:23:59.981
and somebody might come up

01:23:59.981 --> 01:24:01.463
and that could be their favorite part.

01:24:01.463 --> 01:24:04.166
- Because see, once you're
so far into the freestyling,

01:24:04.166 --> 01:24:07.078
once you focus solely on freestyling,

01:24:07.078 --> 01:24:08.451
then that's who you are.

01:24:08.451 --> 01:24:12.812
And when you don't mix
it up and practice it,

01:24:12.812 --> 01:24:17.561
you kind of just pigeonhole
yourself to stay in one person.

01:24:17.561 --> 01:24:20.368
- I would love to be in a position where

01:24:20.368 --> 01:24:21.891
I had the type of movement

01:24:21.891 --> 01:24:25.042
and following where it made
sense to partner with a

01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:27.073
major label because they have muscle.

01:24:27.073 --> 01:24:27.906
You know,

01:24:27.906 --> 01:24:30.194
battle rap is just one
piece of hip hop music

01:24:30.194 --> 01:24:32.341
and hip hop music is
just one piece of music.

01:24:32.341 --> 01:24:35.436
And I'm first and foremost
like a music lover.

01:24:35.436 --> 01:24:39.020
And then hip hop is my
main squeeze, you know?

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:41.693
And battle rap is just
her titty, you know?

01:24:41.693 --> 01:24:43.395
So I'm trying to milk the other one

01:24:43.395 --> 01:24:45.710
and then I'm trying to
work my way down, you know.

01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:46.920

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:49.114

(beat fades)

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:05.823
- A lot of those fans
who watch these battle,

01:25:05.823 --> 01:25:09.364
they don't wanna see a lot
of those rappers doing songs

01:25:09.364 --> 01:25:11.410
and like in a music video,

01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:14.128
like if a battle rapper
makes a song about love,

01:25:14.128 --> 01:25:15.200
like, you know,

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.249
the battle rappers think they're soft now.

01:25:17.249 --> 01:25:18.950
- I might have someone
come up to me in the street

and say they're a huge fan.

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:24.283
And they ask me when
am I dropping an album?

01:25:24.283 --> 01:25:26.657
You know, when are you
putting out a mixtape?

01:25:26.657 --> 01:25:28.911
And they have never heard
my mixtape or my album

01:25:28.911 --> 01:25:32.091
and they're not aware that I
have another one coming out.

(fast guitar beat)

01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:57.748
- So we're going on tour for

01:25:57.748 --> 01:25:58.764
two and a half weeks.

01:25:58.764 --> 01:26:00.511
We're starting in LA we're doing the bay,

01:26:00.511 --> 01:26:03.946
we're going out through Phoenix
and New Mexico all the way

01:26:03.946 --> 01:26:05.660
through Texas to Louisiana.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.530
And then we come back
through like Oklahoma,

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:10.890
I think we come back through Arizona

01:26:10.890 --> 01:26:13.680
and back through California
and we end in Sacramento.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:17.741
The west and the southwest has
been like a fertile touring

01:26:17.741 --> 01:26:19.238
ground for like indie cats

01:26:19.238 --> 01:26:21.463
and underground cats
from LA for a long time.

01:26:21.463 --> 01:26:26.164
So this is kind of like a beaten
path that started years ago

01:26:26.164 --> 01:26:29.271
that, you know, the fandom
has already kind of developed

01:26:29.271 --> 01:26:31.826
and Busdriver's fandom in particular.

01:26:31.826 --> 01:26:33.335
So he's, you know,

01:26:33.335 --> 01:26:36.142
taking me and Nocando
along an established route

01:26:36.142 --> 01:26:39.114
so we can kind of all get on together

01:26:39.114 --> 01:26:41.364

01:28:05.624 --> 01:28:07.651
- If I'm to be honest with you right now,

01:28:07.651 --> 01:28:09.734
I feel absolutely insane.

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.330
My emotional levels are outta control

01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:17.854
and part of that is just the
transition from being on stage

01:28:17.854 --> 01:28:20.318
to going back to regular civilian life.

01:28:20.318 --> 01:28:22.438
There's no manual for it.

01:28:22.438 --> 01:28:25.216
I found it to be very difficult

01:28:25.216 --> 01:28:27.292
because when you're on stage,

01:28:27.292 --> 01:28:32.292
you get to enjoy the full
benefits of supported egomania.

01:28:32.324 --> 01:28:34.399
They all belong to you
and they all know it.

01:28:34.399 --> 01:28:37.222
And there's in accordance with that,

01:28:37.222 --> 01:28:41.042
there's an experience of command
and of center of attention.

01:28:41.042 --> 01:28:43.435
And I actually enjoy it quite a bit.

01:28:43.435 --> 01:28:46.435

(music fades)

01:29:04.687 --> 01:29:07.523
- So we did the Bootleg show last night.

01:29:07.523 --> 01:29:09.748
It went pretty cool.

01:29:09.748 --> 01:29:11.765
Not quite how I had planned.

01:29:11.765 --> 01:29:14.975
I mean I wanted a little
bit more homecoming rah rah.

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:17.604
I wanted the crowd to like
gimme a little bit more

01:29:17.604 --> 01:29:19.307
than they were giving me.

01:29:19.307 --> 01:29:22.726
And it's kind of important
that my stage show maintain a

01:29:22.726 --> 01:29:24.772
certain level of energy.

01:29:24.772 --> 01:29:26.796
'cause in this independent
lane where nobody's really

01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:28.952
selling records, nobody's selling albums,

01:29:28.952 --> 01:29:32.313
the stage show is the only way
that's gonna make some money.

01:29:32.313 --> 01:29:36.239
And it's important for me and this guy

01:29:36.239 --> 01:29:38.003
that I bring some income in.

01:29:38.003 --> 01:29:39.721
- Mike I've known for years

01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:42.229
and I've seen him transition
from like the street freestyler

01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:44.663
to okay, let me sell some CDs,

01:29:44.663 --> 01:29:46.721
let me get a website together.

01:29:46.721 --> 01:29:47.755
And throughout this,

01:29:47.755 --> 01:29:50.547
all these years, his family
was growing at the same time.

01:29:50.547 --> 01:29:52.817
Not just his career.

01:29:52.817 --> 01:29:54.251
- [Narrator] As he continues to expand

01:29:54.251 --> 01:29:55.953
beyond his battle rap reputation,

01:29:55.953 --> 01:29:59.044
Iron Solomon heads to Los
Angeles for some networking

01:29:59.044 --> 01:30:00.953
and industry opportunities.

01:30:00.953 --> 01:30:03.620
But he's going to do it his way.

01:30:05.481 --> 01:30:07.512
- I guess a lot of people come to LA

01:30:07.512 --> 01:30:11.096
or are in New York trying to be on camera

01:30:11.096 --> 01:30:13.440
as much as possible or you know,

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.694
promote themselves.

01:30:14.694 --> 01:30:18.846
But I have kind of a funny
relationship with fame.

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:19.679
You know,

01:30:19.679 --> 01:30:22.176
I wouldn't have a MySpace
page back in the day

01:30:22.176 --> 01:30:24.834
or Facebook or Twitter
if I wasn't an artist.

01:30:24.834 --> 01:30:25.969
I'm not into it like that.

01:30:25.969 --> 01:30:28.851
I'm hoping out here to make
some connections that allow me

01:30:28.851 --> 01:30:30.610
to do some things behind the scenes more.

01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:33.658
'cause it's not always right
for me to be on camera.

01:30:33.658 --> 01:30:35.332
I don't always enjoy it. You know?

01:30:35.332 --> 01:30:37.999
Now I'm out in LA making rounds,

01:30:38.857 --> 01:30:40.156
taking meetings,

01:30:40.156 --> 01:30:42.187
getting in the studio with some people,

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:46.306
doing some writing and
seeing where it takes me.

01:30:46.306 --> 01:30:49.741
I think most people want fame period

01:30:49.741 --> 01:30:52.371
and take various routes to get to it.

01:30:52.371 --> 01:30:53.954
I love making music

01:30:56.783 --> 01:31:00.273
and I would love to be well
known for making great music,

01:31:00.273 --> 01:31:01.318
being a great rapper.

01:31:01.318 --> 01:31:04.568
But I like being on a subway, you know,

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:08.321
and not having anybody know who I am.

01:31:08.321 --> 01:31:09.321
So you know,

01:31:10.353 --> 01:31:14.936
I need to find a balance
between notoriety and privacy.

01:31:17.025 --> 01:31:19.776
